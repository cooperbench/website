        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), so rows and columns from 0 to 7 inclusive. There's also an internal obstacle at (4,6), which is a wall cell that the snake can't move into.\n\nThe snake starts at position [(3,3)] with head direction L, meaning it's facing left. Since it's just one segment, it's both head and tail. The food items are:\n\n- (1,2) with value 1 and life span 10\n\n- (3,5) with value 1 and life span 10\n\n- (2,2) with value 1 and life span 10\n\nAll food is positive, value +1, and life span 10, meaning they disappear after 10 turns if not eaten. Since current turn is 0, they'll disappear at turn 10 if not eaten by then.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival. The snake is currently at (3,3), and I can move U (up to (3,4)), D (down to (3,2)), L (left to (2,3)), or R (right to (4,3)). But since head direction is L, I can't instantly reverse to R on the next move. So possible moves are U, D, or L. R would be opposite to L, so not allowed this turn.\n\nHead direction is L, so moving left is continuing left, moving up or down is turning, moving right is reverse, which is not allowed. So for turn t=0, possible actions: U, D, L.\n\nNow, let's see the food positions:\n\n- (1,2): that's left and down from current position (3,3). From (3,3) to (1,2) is two left and one down, or one left and one down diagonally, but movement is only horizontal/vertical, so it would take multiple moves.\n\n- (3,5): directly above, since (3,3) to (3,5) is up two cells.\n\n- (2,2): left and down, similar to (1,2) but closer. (2,2) is one left and one down from (3,3).\n\nCurrent position: (3,3)\n\nFood at (2,2): that's one step left to (2,3), then down to (2,2)? Or down to (3,2), then left to (2,2). But (2,2) is adjacent? Let's list adjacent cells to (3,3):\n\n- Up: (3,4)\n\n- Down: (3,2)\n\n- Left: (2,3)\n\n- Right: (4,3)\n\nBut right is not possible because of no reverse.\n\nNow, food at (2,2) is not directly adjacent; it's diagonally adjacent. To reach (2,2), I need to go to (2,3) or (3,2) first.\n\nSimilarly, food at (1,2) is not adjacent.\n\nFood at (3,5) is at (3,5), which is up from (3,3) to (3,4) then (3,5). So (3,5) is two cells up.\n\nSince the snake is only one segment, eating food will make it grow to length 2 immediately after eating.\n\nNow, I need to plan multiple moves ahead. Let me think about the grid.\n\nGrid: 8x8, walls at borders and (4,6) obstacle.\n\nSnake: only head at (3,3).\n\nFood: (1,2), (2,2), (3,5) all with value 1, life 10.\n\nLife span 10 means they have 10 turns left including current turn, so they disappear after turn 9? Let's clarify life span.\n\nFrom the rules: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\", and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo for food at turn t=0 with life_span=10, it will disappear at the end of turn 9, meaning it's gone on turn 10. But it can be eaten on turns 0 to 9 inclusive.\n\nSince we're at turn 0, it has 10 turns left to be eaten.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, I should consider the paths to food and risks.\n\nFirst, let's identify safe moves from (3,3).\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: to (3,4)\n\n- D: to (3,2)\n\n- L: to (2,3)\n\nR not allowed.\n\nNow, from each of these, I can go further.\n\nBut I need to think about eating food.\n\nThe closest food is (2,2) or (3,5). (2,2) is not adjacent, but I can reach it in two moves.\n\nFor example, if I go L to (2,3), then from there I can go D to (2,2) to eat the food.\n\nSimilarly, if I go D to (3,2), then L to (2,2) to eat.\n\nOr directly, but since not adjacent, not in one move.\n\n(3,5) is up, so U to (3,4), then U to (3,5) to eat.\n\n(1,2) is farther.\n\nNow, when I eat food, the snake grows. Since it's length 1, after eating, it becomes length 2, with head at food position and tail at previous head position.\n\nFor example, if I eat at (2,2) on turn 1, say.\n\nLet's plan turns.\n\nTurn t=0: I need to choose action for turn 0.\n\nAfter action, the snake moves to new position.\n\nThen on next turn, I choose again.\n\nBut since I need to output actions for multiple turns, I should plan a sequence.\n\nThe answer format is to output actions for turn t=0, t=1, etc., up to some point, but it doesn't specify how many turns to output. It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the output should be a sequence of actions starting from turn 0.\n\nLooking back: \"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn \\(t_1\\): action on turn t_1 Turn \\(t_1 + 1\\): action on turn t_1 + 1 ... }\"\n\nAnd t_1 = 0, so I need to output actions for turn 0, turn 1, turn 2, etc. But for how many turns? It doesn't specify, but since it's a game, I should keep playing until I can't or something, but I think for the purpose of this, I need to plan a sequence of actions that maximizes score while avoiding risks, and since it's turn-based, I might output a few turns.\n\nBut the instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead, so I should plan at least 5 moves.\n\nPerhaps I should simulate multiple steps.\n\nFirst, let's list all food:\n\nFood A: (1,2), value 1, life 10\n\nFood B: (3,5), value 1, life 10\n\nFood C: (2,2), value 1, life 10\n\nAll same value and life.\n\nNow, snake at (3,3), head dir L.\n\nMove options at t=0: U, D, L.\n\nIf I move L to (2,3), then I'm closer to (2,2) and (1,2).\n\nFrom (2,3), I can go U, D, L, or R (but R is back to (3,3), which might be possible if I want, but since snake is short, it might be ok, but let's see.\n\nAfter moving to (2,3), the head direction depends on what I do. If I move L to (2,3), head is now at (2,3), and direction is L if I continue, or if I turn, direction changes.\n\nThe head direction is updated after each move based on the action.\n\nFrom (2,3), possible moves:\n\n- U to (2,4)\n\n- D to (2,2) which has food C\n\n- L to (1,3)\n\n- R to (3,3)\n\nBut R to (3,3) is where the tail was, but since the snake was only one segment, after moving to (2,3), the tail was at (3,3), but when I move, the tail moves away? Let's think carefully.\n\nAt start, snake positions: [(3,3)], so head and tail same.\n\nAfter moving, say to (2,3), now snake is at [(2,3)], but when I eat food, it grows.\n\nIf I don't eat food, snake remains length 1, so after moving to new position, the old position is empty.\n\nIn this case, when I move from (3,3) to (2,3), since no food eaten, snake is now at [(2,3)], so tail is also (2,3), no body.\n\nThen, if I move to (2,2), which has food, I eat it, so snake grows to length 2: head at (2,2), tail at (2,3)? When you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n\nRule: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food.\n\nSo, sequence:\n\nTurn t=0: start at [(3,3)]\n\nI choose action, say move L to (2,3). Since no food at (2,3), snake moves to (2,3), and since no growth, it's still length 1, positions [(2,3)].\n\nHead direction was L, I moved L, so new direction L.\n\nNow turn t=1: I can move from (2,3). Food at (2,2) is below, so I can move D to (2,2).\n\n(2,2) has food, so I eat it. Snake grows: head at (2,2), and new tail added, so positions: head (2,2), tail (2,3)? When you eat, the head moves to food, and the tail stays or what?\n\nStandard snake movement: when you move, the head moves to new cell, and if no food, tail moves forward, so length same. If food eaten, head moves to food, tail does not move, so length increases by one.\n\nIn this case:\n\nAt turn t=0, before move: snake at S0 = (3,3)\n\nI move to new cell N0 = (2,3). Since no food at N0, snake head moves to (2,3), tail is removed (but since only one segment, it's gone), so snake now at [(2,3)].\n\nThen turn t=1, I move to (2,2), which has food. So head moves to (2,2), and since food eaten, tail does not move, so new segment added at previous position? Previous position was (2,3), so now snake has two segments: head (2,2) and tail (2,3).\n\nPositions: [(2,2), (2,3)] with head at (2,2).\n\nHead direction after moving D is down.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=0 I moved D to (3,2), then at (3,2) no food, so snake to [(3,2)], then I could move L to (2,2) to eat, then snake becomes [(2,2), (3,2)] or something.\n\nLet's not digress.\n\nBack to planning.\n\nAt t=0, I have three choices: U, D, L.\n\nOption 1: Move L to (2,3)\n\nThen at (2,3), I can go D to (2,2) to eat food C at (2,2).\n\nThat would be on turn t=1.\n\nAfter eating, snake length 2, head at (2,2), direction D.\n\nThen from there, I can go to other food.\n\nFood B at (3,5) is north, food A at (1,2) is west, but (1,2) is at same y as (2,2) but x=1.\n\n(2,2) to (1,2) is left, adjacent.\n\nBut after eating at (2,2), I have tail at (2,3), so if I move left to (1,2), I eat food A, but then snake grows, head at (1,2), tail at (2,3), and body at (2,2)? Positions: after eating at (2,2), snake is [(2,2), (2,3)] head at (2,2).\n\nThen move L to (1,2): (1,2) has food A, so head moves to (1,2), food eaten, tail does not move, so new segment: head (1,2), then (2,2), tail (2,3). So positions [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3)].\n\nNow, the tail is at (2,3), which is not adjacent to head immediately.\n\nBut I need to think about risks.\n\nFirst, let's consider the other food.\n\nFood B at (3,5) is still there.\n\nAlso, internal obstacle at (4,6), which might be relevant later.\n\nNow, another option at t=0: move U to (3,4)\n\nThen from (3,4), I can go U to (3,5) to eat food B.\n\n(3,5) has food, so eat at t=1 if I go U from (3,4).\n\nAfter moving to (3,4) at t=0, snake at [(3,4)], head dir U.\n\nThen t=1 move U to (3,5), eat food, snake grows to [(3,5), (3,4)] head at (3,5) dir U.\n\nThen from there, I can go to other food.\n\nFood C at (2,2) and A at (1,2) are south-west.\n\nBut (3,5) to (2,2) is not direct.\n\nOption at t=0: move D to (3,2)\n\nThen from (3,2), I can go L to (2,2) to eat food C at t=1.\n\nSimilar to first option but starting with down.\n\n(3,2) to (2,2) is left, so after eating, snake at [(2,2), (3,2)] head at (2,2) dir L.\n\nThen I can go to (1,2) or other places.\n\nNow, I need to think long-term. Which food to go for first?\n\nAlso, all food has life 10, so plenty of time, but I should eat them efficiently.\n\nMoreover, after eating, the snake grows, which might block paths or create risks.\n\nCurrently, with length 1, no body, so no collision risk except walls or obstacles.\n\nWalls: borders are walls, so x=0,7 y=0,7 are walls. Internal obstacle (4,6).\n\nSo from (3,3), moving U to (3,4) is safe, (3,4) is within bounds.\n\nD to (3,2) safe.\n\nL to (2,3) safe, x=2>0.\n\nNow, after eating one food, snake length 2, so when moving, if head moves to where tail is, it might be ok if tail moves, but need to be careful with tail reward danger.\n\nTail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut in this case, when snake is short, it might not be immediate issue.\n\nLet's simulate going for (2,2) first.\n\nSuppose at t=0, I move L to (2,3). Snake now at [(2,3)], dir L.\n\nTurn t=1: move D to (2,2). (2,2) has food, so eat, snake grows to length 2: positions [(2,2), (2,3)] head at (2,2) dir D.\n\nNow, from here, I can move to eat other food.\n\nAvailable moves from (2,2): U, D, L, R but R to (2,3) is where the tail is.\n\n(2,2) adjacent cells:\n\n- U: (2,3) - but that's the tail position. If I move there, what happens?\n\nIn snake, moving to the tail cell is usually safe because the tail moves away at the same time, so no collision.\n\nRule: \"But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving to tail position is safe, as long as after move, it doesn't collide.\n\nWhen head moves to tail cell, since tail moves forward, the cell is vacated, so no collision.\n\nIn this case, from (2,2), moving U to (2,3): since no food at (2,3), head moves to (2,3), and tail moves from (2,3) to... tail is at (2,3), head moving to (2,3), but (2,3) is occupied by tail.\n\nAfter head moves to (2,3), since no food, tail moves to the next segment, but in this case, there is only one body segment, which is the tail at (2,3), so when head moves to (2,3), tail should move to where? In standard snake, when head moves to a new cell, the tail moves to the next cell in the body, but since it's a chain, the tail cell is abandoned.\n\nPositions before move: head at (2,2), tail at (2,3)\n\nI move head to (2,3). But (2,3) is occupied by tail. Since I move to tail position, and no food, the head moves to (2,3), and the tail moves to the previous position of the segment before it, but since only two segments, the tail was at (2,3), and it moves away? I think I'm confusing.\n\nStandard: when you move, the head moves to the new cell. If no food eaten, the tail moves forward one cell, meaning the last segment is removed.\n\nSo in this case: positions: segments [head: (2,2), tail: (2,3)]\n\nI move head to (2,3). New head position is (2,3). Since I moved to a cell that had the tail, and no food, the tail should move. But where? The tail moves to the next position, but since the head is now at the old tail position, the tail needs to move to where? Actually, when head moves to a new cell, the body follows, so the segment that was at (2,2) moves to (2,3), but (2,3) was the tail, so the new head is at (2,3), and the tail was at (2,3), but since it moved, the tail position is vacated, and the new tail is the segment that was behind, but there is only one other segment, which was at (2,2), so it moves to (2,3), but (2,3) is now the head? Messy.\n\nBetter to think of the list of positions.\n\nBefore move: positions list: index 0: (2,2) head, index 1: (2,3) tail.\n\nI move head to (2,3). New head position is (2,3). Since no food eaten, the tail is removed. So the new positions are: head at (2,3), and the body segment at (2,2) moves to where the head was? No.\n\nWhen the head moves to a new cell, that becomes the new head position. Then, if no food, the tail position is removed, so the list shifts.\n\nSpecifically: new head position is (2,3). The previous head (2,2) becomes body. But (2,3) was the tail, so when head moves to (2,3), it's the same cell as tail, but in terms of positions, the new head is at (2,3), and since no food, the tail (which was at (2,3)) is removed, so the segment at (2,2) is now the tail. So new positions: only (2,3) for head and tail? Let's see:\n\nAfter move: head moves to (2,3), which was the tail position. The tail cell is vacated because the tail is removed, but since head is moving to it, it's occupied. Positions: the head is now at (2,3), and the body segment at (2,2) is still there, but since tail was removed, the new snake is just the head at (2,3), and the segment at (2,2) is removed because tail is cut off.\n\nI think I have it: when you move to a cell with no food, the head moves to new cell, and the tail is removed from the list.\n\nSo before move: positions [ (2,2), (2,3) ] head at (2,2), tail at (2,3)\n\nMove head to (2,3): new head position (2,3). Since no food at (2,3), the tail is removed, so the new positions are [ (2,3) ] because the segment at (2,2) is gone, and head is at (2,3), so snake is length 1 at (2,3).\n\nThat can't be right. If I move the head to the tail position, and no food, the tail is removed, so the snake shortens to length 1.\n\nBut in this case, from length 2, moving head to tail position with no food should result in the head and tail combining or something? But in standard snake, it's not supposed to shorten; the tail moves forward.\n\nI think I'm misremembering.\n\nLet me recall the rules from the problem.\n\n\"Movement Constraints:\n- In each turn you can choose to move 1 cell in following directions: U(x,y+1), D(x,y-1), L(x-1,y), R(x+1,y)\n- No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\n\nDeadly Collisions:\n- Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nAlso, from the tail reward danger: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nSo, when moving to the tail cell, it is safe because the tail moves forward, so no collision.\n\nIn the movement, when you move to a cell, if it's the tail, the tail moves away at the same time, so the head can occupy that cell without collision.\n\nIn terms of positions: suppose positions [A, B] where A head, B tail.\n\nI move head to B. Since B is the tail, and I move to B, no collision because the tail moves to the next position, but there is no next position, so the tail is removed, and head is at B, so snake becomes length 1 at [B].\n\nBut then it's shorter, which is not typical for snake game. Usually, the length stays the same unless you eat food.\n\nI think I have a confusion.\n\nPerhaps for the tail cell, when head moves to it, since tail moves forward, the cell is free, so head can move in.\n\nBut in the case of only two segments, if head moves to tail position, with no food, the tail moves to where? There is no other segment.\n\nLet's assume the standard behavior: when head moves to a new cell, if it's not food, the tail moves forward, meaning the last segment is removed, and the head is at new position, with the body following.\n\nFor two segments: [H, T]\n\nMove H to new position N.\n\nIf N is not food, then new positions: [N, H] but H was at old position, so it's [N, old H position], but old H position is where the body was.\n\nPositions: let's say segments S0 (head), S1 (tail).\n\nAfter move, new head at new position, and if no food, S1 is removed, so new segments are [new position] and the previous S0 becomes the body, but S0 was head, now it's body.\n\nExample: positions: S0: (2,2), S1: (2,3)\n\nMove head to (2,3). New head position is (2,3). Since (2,3) has no food (in this case, it does have tail, but we move to it), and no food, so tail is removed. The new snake has only the new head at (2,3), so length 1.\n\nBut that means the snake shortened, which is not how snake usually works. In snake, the length should remain constant unless you eat or eat negative food.\n\nI think there's a mistake.\n\nPerhaps when moving to the tail cell, it is considered no collision, and the tail moves away, so for two segments, moving head to tail position with no food should result in the head at the tail position, and the tail is removed, so snake shortens to length 1.\n\nBut that seems odd for the game.\n\nLet's look for clarification in the rules.\n\nThe rules don't specify this case, but from \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\" So for multiple segments, the tail moving forward means it leaves the cell, so head can enter.\n\nFor two segments, when head moves to tail position, tail moves to the previous position of the head or something? I think it's better to think that the tail cell is vacated when the tail moves, so head can move in.\n\nIn terms of position list: before move: [P_head, P_tail]\n\nMove head to P_tail.\n\nSince P_tail is the tail, and we move to it, no collision, and after move, the head is at P_tail, and the tail has moved from P_tail, so the segment that was at P_tail is gone, and the new tail is the segment that was at P_head, but P_head is moving to P_tail, so the new positions are [P_tail] only, since the body segment is removed.\n\nI think for simplicity, in this game, when you move to the tail cell with no food, the snake shortens to length 1 at that position.\n\nBut that might not be intended. Perhaps the rules imply that for longer snakes, the tail moves to the next body segment's position.\n\nBut with only two segments, there is no \"next\" body segment.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's assume that for this game, moving to the tail position with no food is safe and the snake becomes shorter, but since the snake can grow by eating, it might be ok, but it's strange.\n\nPerhaps in this implementation, the tail position is not considered a body segment for collision when moving into it, because it moves away.\n\nSo when you move to tail cell, it is not a collision, and after move, the head is at that cell, and the tail is removed, so length decreases by 1.\n\nBut in this case, for the snake to grow, you need to eat food.\n\nIn our case, at (2,2), if I move U to (2,3), and (2,3) has no food, then snake shortens to length 1 at (2,3).\n\nBut if I move to a cell with food, it grows.\n\nFor now, to avoid this, I should not move to the tail position unless necessary, but it might be safe but inefficient.\n\nIn this specific state, after eating at (2,2), I have head at (2,2), tail at (2,3), so moving U to (2,3) with no food would shorten the snake, which is bad because I just grew it.\n\nSo better to move elsewhere.\n\nFrom (2,2), I can move D to (2,1), L to (1,2), or R to (3,2), or U to (2,3).\n\n(2,1): y=1, not wall, y=0 is wall, so (2,1) is safe.\n\nL to (1,2): (1,2) has food A, so I can eat it.\n\nR to (3,2): (3,2) might be free.\n\nU to (2,3): tail position, no food, so if I move there, snake shortens to (2,3), which is bad.\n\nSo from (2,2), better to move L to (1,2) to eat food A, or D to (2,1), or R to (3,2).\n\nSimilarly, moving D or R might be away from food.\n\nLet's go back to turn 0.\n\nI should consider going for the food at (3,5) first.\n\nAt t=0, move U to (3,4)\n\nThen at t=1, move U to (3,5) to eat food B.\n\nSnake now at [(3,5), (3,4)] head at (3,5) dir U.\n\nFrom here, I can move to other food.\n\nFood at (2,2) and (1,2) are south-west.\n\nI can move L to (2,5), or R to (4,5), or D to (3,4) but (3,4) is the tail.\n\n(3,4) is tail position.\n\nIf I move D to (3,4), with no food, snake shortens to (3,4), length 1.\n\nBad.\n\nMove L to (2,5): (2,5) is free, no wall, not food.\n\nThen from (2,5), I can go down to (2,4), etc, towards (2,2).\n\nBut (2,2) is at y=2, so I need to go down.\n\nSimilarly, move R to (4,5), but (4,5) is close to obstacle (4,6), but (4,5) is safe.\n\nBut then I'm moving away from the other food.\n\nSo from (3,5), moving L to (2,5) might be good to go towards (2,2).\n\nBut let's compare the options.\n\nAnother option at t=0: move D to (3,2)\n\nThen at t=1, move L to (2,2) to eat food C.\n\nSnake at [(2,2), (3,2)] head at (2,2) dir L.\n\nThen I can move L to (1,2) to eat food A at t=2.\n\nThen snake at [(1,2), (2,2), (3,2)] head at (1,2) dir L.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (3,5) or other places.\n\n(3,5) is at (3,5), so I need to go right and up.\n\nFrom (1,2), I can move U to (1,3), then R to (2,3), etc.\n\nBut there might be risks later.\n\nSimilarly, if I go for (3,5) first, then to (2,2), it might take longer.\n\nLet's think about the grid and obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), which might block paths, but for now, it's not in the way.\n\nAlso, walls at borders.\n\nTo maximize score, I should eat all three food, but with life span 10, I have time.\n\nBut I need to plan a path.\n\nSince all food is positive, I should eat them as soon as possible to grow and have more flexibility, but with length 1, it's flexible.\n\nBut after growing, I have to manage the body.\n\nLet's consider the distance.\n\nFrom current (3,3) to (2,2): Manhattan distance |3-2| + |3-2| = 2, so can reach in 2 moves.\n\nTo (3,5): |3-3| + |5-3| = 2, also 2 moves.\n\nTo (1,2): |3-1| + |3-2| = 2 + 1 = 3 moves.\n\nSo (2,2) and (3,5) are equally close, (1,2) is farther.\n\nBut (2,2) and (1,2) are close to each other.\n\n(3,5) is isolated.\n\nIf I go for (2,2) first, I can then go to (1,2) easily.\n\nIf I go for (3,5) first, then to (2,2) it takes more moves.\n\nFor example, from (3,5) to (2,2): |3-2| + |5-2| =1+3=4 moves, plus the 2 moves to get to (3,5), total 6 moves to eat both, whereas if I eat (2,2) first, then (1,2) in one more move, total 3 moves for two food, then to (3,5) from (1,2) or from (2,2).\n\nFrom (2,2) to (3,5): |2-3| + |2-5| =1+3=4 moves.\n\nSimilarly, from (1,2) to (3,5): |1-3| + |2-5| =2+3=5 moves.\n\nBut after eating (2,2) and (1,2), snake is longer, so movement might be slower.\n\nBut for score, eating sooner is better, but since no penalty for time, I can take time.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should eat all, but there might be more food later, but the state only has these three for now.\n\nThe state doesn't say new food spawns, so only these three food to eat.\n\nSo I need to eat all three to get score 3.\n\nThen after that, I can survive, but with no food, I can move around safely.\n\nBut with walls, I might be trapped.\n\nBut for now, focus on eating food.\n\nSo best to eat (2,2) and (1,2) first since they are close, then go to (3,5).\n\n(2,2) and (1,2) are at (2,2) and (1,2), so from (3,3), I can go to (2,2) in two moves, then to (1,2) in one move, then to (3,5) in about 4 moves.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (3,5) in two moves, then to (2,2) in 4 moves, then to (1,2) in one move, but (1,2) might be eaten later.\n\nLife span is 10, so all can be eaten within 10 turns.\n\nBut let's calculate turns.\n\nSuppose I go for (2,2) first.\n\nTurn t=0: move from (3,3) to (2,3) L.\n\nSnake at [(2,3)], no food, length 1.\n\nTurn t=1: move from (2,3) to (2,2) D, eat food, snake grows to length 2: [(2,2), (2,3)] head at (2,2) dir D.\n\nTurn t=2: move from (2,2) to (1,2) L, eat food at (1,2), snake grows to length 3: [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3)] head at (1,2) dir L.\n\nNow, food eaten: (2,2) and (1,2), so A and C eaten, B at (3,5) left.\n\nFrom (1,2), I need to go to (3,5).\n\nPossible path: move U to (1,3), then R to (2,3), but (2,3) is the tail position.\n\nPositions: head (1,2), body (2,2), tail (2,3).\n\nIf I move U to (1,3), then snake moves, no food at (1,3), so head to (1,3), tail removed, so new positions: head (1,3), body (1,2), tail (2,2)? Let's see.\n\nBefore move: segments: 0: (1,2) head, 1: (2,2), 2: (2,3) tail.\n\nMove head to (1,3). New head position (1,3). No food, so tail is removed, so the last segment (2,3) is removed. New positions: the previous segments shift, so new head (1,3), then body (1,2), and tail (2,2)? No.\n\nAfter head moves to new position, the body segments move forward: the segment that was at (1,2) moves to where the head was going, but it's not; the head is separate.\n\nStandard: the new head position is (1,3). Then the body segments follow: the segment that was at position 1 (2,2) moves to the previous head position (1,2)? I think it's better to think that each segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the chain.\n\nPositions list before move: [ (1,2), (2,2), (2,3) ]\n\nMove head to (1,3). New positions: the new head is at (1,3). Then the first body segment moves to the old head position (1,2)? No, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo the segment that was at (2,2) moves to (1,2), and the segment that was at (2,3) moves to (2,2).\n\nBut (1,2) is now occupied by the moving body.\n\nNew positions: head at (1,3), then the segment that was at (2,2) moves to (1,2), and the segment that was at (2,3) moves to (2,2). So new positions: [ (1,3), (1,2), (2,2) ] with head at (1,3), tail at (2,2).\n\nThen from there, I can move to (2,3) or other cells.\n\nBut (2,3) is now free? In this case, after move, (2,3) is empty.\n\nThen I can move R to (2,3) from (1,3)? From (1,3), I can move R to (2,3), or U to (1,4), etc.\n\nBut let's not simulate all.\n\nBack to turn 0.\n\nAnother choice: at t=0, move D to (3,2)\n\nThen t=1 move L to (2,2) eat C, snake at [(2,2), (3,2)] head (2,2) dir L\n\nThen t=2 move L to (1,2) eat A, snake at [(1,2), (2,2), (3,2)] head (1,2) dir L\n\nThen same as above.\n\nOr at t=0 move U to (3,4)\n\nt=1 move U to (3,5) eat B, snake at [(3,5), (3,4)] head (3,5) dir U\n\nThen from (3,5), I need to go to (2,2).\n\nFor example, move L to (2,5), then D to (2,4), then D to (2,3), then D to (2,2) but at (2,2) there is food, but when I reach, it might be gone or something, but life span 10, so on turn 2, it has 8 turns left, so ok.\n\nBut it takes more moves.\n\nFrom (3,5), move L to (2,5), then from (2,5), I can go directly down to (2,2) in three moves: (2,5) to (2,4), to (2,3), to (2,2).\n\nAt (2,2), eat food C.\n\nSimilarly, from there to (1,2).\n\nBut (1,2) is also there.\n\nIn terms of number of moves, going for (2,2) first is better to eat two food quickly.\n\nAlso, after eating (2,2) and (1,2), I have a longer snake, but I can navigate to (3,5).\n\nWith the internal obstacle at (4,6), it might not affect if I stay away.\n\nBut (3,5) is at (3,5), obstacle at (4,6), so not directly blocking.\n\nNow, about the tail reward danger: in this case, since the snake is short, and food is not on tail, it might not be an issue yet.\n\nFor example, when I have head adjacent to tail and food on tail cell, but in our case, when eating, the food is not on tail usually.\n\nBut let's not worry for now.\n\nSo I think the best is to go for (2,2) and (1,2) first.\n\nAt t=0, move L to (2,3)\n\nThen t=1 move D to (2,2) eat C\n\nThen t=2 move L to (1,2) eat A\n\nNow, at t=2, after eating A, snake at [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3)]? Earlier I had after eating at (1,2): head at (1,2), body at (2,2), tail at (2,3) or something.\n\nAfter t=2 move to (1,2) eat, so positions: before move at t=2: snake at [(2,2), (2,3)] head (2,2)\n\nMove L to (1,2) eat, so head to (1,2), food eaten, tail does not move, so new segment added at previous tail position? No.\n\nWhen you eat food, head moves to food cell, and since food eaten, tail does not move, so the length increases by one. The new head is at the food cell, and the body includes the previous positions.\n\nBefore move: positions [ (2,2), (2,3) ] head (2,2)\n\nMove head to (1,2), which has food, so head moves to (1,2), and since food eaten, the tail does not move, so the position (2,3) remains, and the segment at (2,2) is now behind the head, so new positions: head (1,2), then the previous head (2,2) becomes body, and tail at (2,3), so [ (1,2), (2,2), (2,3) ].\n\nYes.\n\nNow, head at (1,2), direction L (since moved left).\n\nNow, I need to go to (3,5).\n\nFirst, I need to move away from the wall; x=1, y=2, not wall yet.\n\nPossible moves: U to (1,3), D to (1,1), L to (0,2) but x=0 is wall, so cannot, R to (2,2) but (2,2) is body.\n\n(2,2) is occupied by body, so if I move R to (2,2), it's body collision, deadly.\n\nSimilarly, U to (1,3) or D to (1,1) are possible.\n\nSay move U to (1,3).\n\nThen no food, so head to (1,3), tail moves from (2,3) to... since no food, tail removed, so new positions: head at (1,3), body at (1,2), tail at (2,2)? Before move: [ (1,2), (2,2), (2,3) ] head (1,2)\n\nMove U to (1,3), no food, so head to (1,3), and tail (2,3) removed, and body moves: the segment at (2,2) moves to (1,2), and the segment at (1,2) was head, now it moves? New positions: new head (1,3), then the previous head (1,2) becomes body, and the segment that was at (2,2) moves to the position of the previous body, but it's a chain.\n\nAfter head moves to (1,3), the first body segment (which was at (1,2)) moves to the new head position? No.\n\nThe body segments shift: the segment that was at position 1 ( (2,2) ) moves to the position of segment 0 ( (1,2) ), and the segment that was at position 2 ( (2,3) ) moves to position 1 ( (2,2) ), but position 1 is (2,2), so it moves to (2,2), same position? Confusion.\n\nPositions list: indices: 0: (1,2) head, 1: (2,2), 2: (2,3) tail.\n\nHead moves to new position (1,3).\n\nSince no food eaten, the tail is removed, so we remove index 2.\n\nThen the new head is at (1,3), and the body segments are the previous segments but shifted: the new position 0 is (1,3), new position 1 is the old position 0, which is (1,2), and new position 2 is old position 1, which is (2,2). But old position 1 is (2,2), so new positions: [ (1,3), (1,2), (2,2) ] with head at (1,3), tail at (2,2).\n\nYes.\n\nThen from (1,3), I can move R to (2,3), or U to (1,4), or D to (1,2) but (1,2) is body, collision.\n\n(2,3) is free now, since tail moved.\n\nIn new positions, (2,3) is empty.\n\nSo move R to (2,3).\n\nThen from (2,3), I can go to (3,3), etc, towards (3,5).\n\nBut this is taking time.\n\nTo go to (3,5) faster, from (1,2) after eating, I could move in a different direction.\n\nBut from (1,2), I can only move U or D, since L is wall, R is body.\n\nSo U or D.\n\nIf I move D to (1,1), then similar, I go down, then need to come back up.\n\nSo better to move U to (1,3) as above.\n\nThen from (1,3) move R to (2,3), then from (2,3) move U to (2,4), then to (2,5), then to (3,5)? (2,5) to (3,5) is R.\n\nBut (3,5) has food, so I can eat it.\n\nPath from (1,3) to (3,5): (1,3) to (2,3) R, then (2,3) to (2,4) U, then (2,4) to (2,5) U, then (2,5) to (3,5) R, eat.\n\n4 moves.\n\nBut at each point, I need to check if cells are free.\n\nAt turn t=2, after eating at (1,2), positions [ (1,2), (2,2), (2,3) ]\n\nThen t=3: move U to (1,3), no food, positions become [ (1,3), (1,2), (2,2) ]\n\nt=4: move R to (2,3), (2,3) is free, no food, so head to (2,3), tail removed, positions: new head (2,3), then body (1,3), tail (1,2)? Before move: [ (1,3), (1,2), (2,2) ] head (1,3)\n\nMove R to (2,3), no food, head to (2,3), tail (2,2) removed, so new positions: head (2,3), body (1,3), and the segment at (1,2) moves to (1,3)? New positions: [ (2,3), (1,3), (1,2) ]? Let's calculate.\n\nPositions before: 0: (1,3) head, 1: (1,2), 2: (2,2) tail\n\nMove head to (2,3)\n\nNew head (2,3)\n\nNo food, tail removed (index 2, (2,2) gone)\n\nThen new body: the previous segment 0 (1,3) becomes body at its position, but it's now behind, so new position 0: (2,3), position 1: old position 0 (1,3), position 2: old position 1 (1,2)\n\nBut old position 1 is (1,2), so new positions: [ (2,3), (1,3), (1,2) ] head (2,3), tail (1,2)\n\nThen t=5: move U to (2,4), no food, positions become [ (2,4), (2,3), (1,3) ] head (2,4), etc.\n\nThen t=6: move U to (2,5), no food, positions [ (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) ]\n\nt=7: move R to (3,5), eat food B, so head to (3,5), food eaten, tail does not move, so new segment added, positions: head (3,5), then previous head (2,5) becomes body, and tail (2,3) remains, so [ (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) ]? Before move: [ (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) ] head (2,5)\n\nMove R to (3,5) eat, so head to (3,5), no tail move, so positions: new head (3,5), then old head (2,5) becomes body, then old body (2,4), then old tail (2,3), so [ (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) ]\n\nLength 4.\n\nAll food eaten by turn 7.\n\nIf I went for (3,5) first, it might take longer.\n\nFor example, t=0 move U to (3,4)\n\nt=1 move U to (3,5) eat B, snake at [(3,5), (3,4)]\n\nt=2 move L to (2,5), no food, positions [ (2,5), (3,5) ] head (2,5) dir L\n\nt=3 move D to (2,4), no food, positions [ (2,4), (2,5), (3,5) ]? Before move: [ (2,5), (3,5) ] head (2,5)\n\nMove D to (2,4), no food, head to (2,4), tail removed, so positions [ (2,4), (2,5) ] head (2,4) dir D\n\nt=4 move D to (2,3), no food, positions [ (2,3), (2,4) ]\n\nt=5 move D to (2,2) eat C, snake grows to [ (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) ] head (2,2) dir D\n\nt=6 move L to (1,2) eat A, snake [ (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) ]\n\nSo also by turn 6, all eaten, but snake longer.\n\nIn first path, eaten by turn 7 with length 4, here by turn 6 with length 4.\n\nTurn 6 for this path.\n\nt=0 to t=6, 7 actions? t=0 action, t=1, ..., t=6 action, so 7 turns, positions after each action.\n\nIn terms of when food eaten: in first path, C at t=1, A at t=2, B at t=7.\n\nIn second path, B at t=1, C at t=5, A at t=6.\n\nSo both similar, but in first path, two food eaten earlier.\n\nSince score is per food, and no time penalty, it doesn't matter, but for survival, shorter snake might be better, but both end with length 4.\n\nIn first path, after t=2, length 3, then grow to 4 at t=7.\n\nIn second, length 2 at t=1, then 3 at t=5, 4 at t=6.\n\nBut not significant.\n\nNow, back to turn 0, I could move directly towards food.\n\nBut at t=0, if I move D to (3,2), then t=1 move L to (2,2) eat C, then t=2 move L to (1,2) eat A, same as first option.\n\nOr move U to (3,4), then to (3,5) eat B.\n\nBut with the internal obstacle, it might affect later movements, but (4,6) is not in the way for these paths.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (2,2) and (1,2) are close to the border, so after eating, I need to navigate out.\n\nIn the first path, from (1,2), I moved up to (1,3), which is fine.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nSince the game continues, I should output until I eat all food or something, but the format doesn't specify.\n\nPerhaps output a sequence of 5 moves or so.\n\nBut thinking 5+ turns ahead, I can plan the first few moves.\n\nSince at t=0, moving L or D both lead to eating (2,2) quickly, moving U to (3,4) leads to (3,5).\n\nBut moving L or D is similar.\n\nLet's see the head direction.\n\nCurrent head dir L, so moving L is straight, U or D are turns.\n\nBut not important.\n\nI think moving towards (2,2) is fine.\n\nTo avoid the body issue later, but it should be ok.\n\nAnother point: the food at (2,2) is at (2,2), and from (3,3), I can go directly? Not adjacent, so need two moves.\n\nIf I move D to (3,2) at t=0, then (3,2) has no food, snake at [(3,2)], then t=1 move L to (2,2) eat.\n\nSimilarly, if move L to (2,3) at t=0, then t=1 move D to (2,2) eat.\n\nIn both cases, I eat at t=1.\n\nThen continue.\n\nI think I'll go with moving L at t=0 to (2,3), then D to (2,2) at t=1, then L to (1,2) at t=2.\n\nThen for t=3, move U to (1,3) to start going towards (3,5).\n\nBut I need to output actions.\n\nThe answer should be for turns starting from t=0.\n\nAlso, for the sequence, I need to specify the actions.\n\nSince the state is given, and I need to maximize score, eating all is the goal.\n\nBut to be safe, let's confirm the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, walls at x=0,7 y=0,7.\n\n(0,0) to (7,7), so cells from (0,0) to (7,7), borders are walls, so snake cannot move to x=0,7 or y=0,7.\n\nInternal obstacle (4,6), wall.\n\nFood at (1,2), (3,5), (2,2) all within bounds.\n\nNo immediate risks.\n\nSo for turn 0, I'll move L to (2,3).\n\nThen for turn 1, move D to (2,2) to eat.\n\nThen turn 2, move L to (1,2) to eat.\n\nThen for turn 3, from (1,2) with body, move U to (1,3).\n\nThen turn 4, move R to (2,3), assuming (2,3) is free.\n\nAt turn 2 after eating at (1,2), positions [ (1,2), (2,2), (2,3) ]\n\nThen turn 3 move U to (1,3), no food, positions become [ (1,3), (1,2), (2,2) ]\n\n(2,3) is free.\n\nTurn 4 move R to (2,3), no food, positions [ (2,3), (1,3), (1,2) ]\n\nThen turn 5 move U to (2,4), no food, positions [ (2,4), (2,3), (1,3) ]\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut I need to go to (3,5), so from (2,3) or (2,4), move to (3,4) etc.\n\nBut for the output, I can output up to 5 turns or so.\n\nSince the instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead, outputting 5 actions might be good.\n\nAt turn 0, t=0.\n\nOutput actions for t=0, t=1, t=2, t=3, t=4.\n\nBut at t=4, it depends.\n\nI think for simplicity, I'll output the sequence to eat the first two food, then start towards the third.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 0: L (to (2,3))\n\nTurn 1: D (to (2,2) eat C)\n\nTurn 2: L (to (1,2) eat A)\n\nThen turn 3: U (to (1,3))\n\nThen turn 4: R (to (2,3))\n\nThen from there, I can continue to U to (2,4), etc.\n\nBut in the output, I can put these.\n\nTo be consistent, let's see the head direction.\n\nAt turn 0, head dir L, move L, so new dir L.\n\nTurn 1, from (2,3), dir L, move D to (2,2), so new dir D.\n\nTurn 2, from (2,2), dir D, move L to (1,2), new dir L.\n\nTurn 3, from (1,2), dir L, move U to (1,3), new dir U.\n\nTurn 4, from (1,3), dir U, move R to (2,3), new dir R.\n\nAll fine.\n\nIf I had moved D at t=0, similar.\n\nBut with move L at t=0, I'm closer to (1,2).\n\nNow, about the food at (3,5), it has life 10, so by turn 10 it disappears, but in my plan, I eat at turn 7 or so, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly, no other risks.\n\nSo I think this is good.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating all three positive food items while ensuring long-term survival, I will plan a sequence of moves that prioritizes eating the closest food first to minimize risk and then navigate towards the remaining food. The snake starts at (3,3) with head direction left (L). The food at (2,2) is the closest (Manhattan distance 2) and can be eaten in two moves. After eating (2,2), the snake can immediately eat (1,2) in one move. Then, the snake will navigate towards (3,5), which is farther away but has a life span of 10 turns, allowing enough time to reach it safely.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Immediate Moves (Turns 0-2)**: Move left (L) to (2,3) at turn 0, then down (D) to (2,2) at turn 1 to eat the first food. Then move left (L) to (1,2) at turn 2 to eat the second food. This sequence eats two food items quickly, growing the snake to length 3 by turn 2.\n- **Path to Third Food (Turns 3-4+)**: After eating (1,2), move up (U) to (1,3) at turn 3 to avoid the wall at x=0 and body collisions. Then move right (R) to (2,3) at turn 4 to position for moving upward toward (3,5). From there, continue to (2,4), (2,5), and (3,5) to eat the third food by around turn 7.\n- **Risks Avoided**: \n  - No wall or obstacle collisions: The path avoids x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and the internal obstacle at (4,6).\n  - No body collisions: When moving to (2,3) at turn 4, it is safe as (2,3) was previously the tail but is now vacant.\n  - Tail reward danger is not triggered, as food is not on the tail when the head is adjacent.\n- **Long-term Survival**: After eating all food, the snake can move freely in open areas. The grid has space to maneuver, and with all food eaten, no starvation risk exists within the life span.\n\n### Planned Actions (5+ Turns):\n- **Turn 0**: Move L (left) to (2,3) – positions snake closer to (2,2) and (1,2).\n- **Turn 1**: Move D (down) to (2,2) – eat food at (2,2); snake grows to length 2.\n- **Turn 2**: Move L (left) to (1,2) – eat food at (1,2); snake grows to length 3.\n- **Turn 3**: Move U (up) to (1,3) – avoid wall and body; head now at (1,3).\n- **Turn 4**: Move R (right) to (2,3) – position to move upward; head now at (2,3).\n- **Beyond Turn 4**: Continue to (2,4) via U, then (2,5) via U, then (3,5) via R to eat the third food by turn 7. All moves are safe with no collisions.\n\nThis sequence eats all food efficiently by turn 7, maximizing the score to 3 while ensuring survival through careful pathing.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 1: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 2: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 3: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 4: R (right) \\\\\n}",

I must think at least 5 turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nThe current turn is t=1. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (4,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block movement.\n\nSnake positions: only one segment, which is the head at (2,3). Since it's just the head, there's no body or tail to worry about collisions yet. Head direction is left, so currently moving L (left).\n\nFood positions with value and life span:\n\n- (1,2) value 9, life span 1? Wait, the format says (x,y, life_span, value), but here it's written as (1,2,9,1). That must be (x,y, value, life_span). Let me check: \" (1, 2, 9, 1) \" – probably (x,y, value, life_span) since value is 9 and life span is 1 for this one. Similarly, (3,5,9,1) value 9, life span 1; (2,2,9,1) value 9, life span 1; (5,2,10,1) value 10, life span 1.\n\nAll food has life span 1, meaning they disappear after this turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn t=1, life span is given, and it will disappear after N turns. For all food, life span is 1, so after turn 1, they vanish? But that can't be right because if they vanish after this turn, I can't eat them unless I eat now.\n\nLife span: disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So for a food with life span L at turn t, it will disappear at turn t + L - 1 or something? Let's clarify.\n\nTypically, if life span is N at turn t, it means it will be present for N more turns, including turn t. So after N turns, it disappears. For example, at turn t, life span N: available on turn t, t+1, ..., t+N-1; disappears at turn t+N.\n\nBut here, all food has life span 1 at turn 1. So for (1,2,9,1): value 9, life span 1. That means it is available only on turn 1, and disappears after turn 1. Similarly for others.\n\nBut I'm at turn 1, so I can eat it this turn if I move to it.\n\nAlso, food can spawn under snake body, but here snake is only head at (2,3), and food is at (1,2), (3,5), (2,2), (5,2). None of these are under the snake, since snake is only one cell.\n\n(2,2) is adjacent to head (2,3), but not under it.\n\nNow, head is at (2,3), direction left.\n\nPossible moves: since head direction is L (left), I can move U, D, L, but not R because no instant reverse. Current direction L, so I cannot move R (right) next turn because that would be opposite.\n\nAllowed moves: not opposite to current direction. So from L, I can go U, D, or L (continue left), but not R.\n\nNow, grid: walls at borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: only (2,3), so no body, just head. That means no collision risk except walls or obstacles.\n\nFood:\n\n- (1,2): value 9, life span 1\n\n- (3,5): value 9, life span 1\n\n- (2,2): value 9, life span 1\n\n- (5,2): value 10, life span 1\n\nAll life span 1, so I must eat them this turn or they disappear. But I can only eat one this turn since I move to one cell.\n\nAt turn 1, I move to a cell, and if that cell has food, I eat it.\n\nSince snake has only head, eating positive food will increase length to 2, so I grow a tail.\n\nBut currently, no tail, so no issue with tail reward danger.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead. But since all food disappears after this turn, except possibly new food spawns? The state doesn't say anything about new food spawning. I think food only appears as given, and no new food mentioned, so after this turn, all food gone, and I might starve or something? But probably, new food will spawn later, but the state doesn't specify. I have to work with what's given.\n\nIn the rules, it doesn't say food respawns, so I should assume that only the given food is present, and after they disappear, no food until new is given, but since this is a sequence, I need to plan for multiple turns, but the state is only for turn 1.\n\nThe answer format is to output actions for multiple turns starting from t=1.\n\nBut after turn 1, if I eat food, I grow, and then I need to move on.\n\nAlso, since all food has life span 1, they disappear after turn 1 if not eaten.\n\nSo at turn 1, I must choose which food to eat, or none, but not eating means I miss all food, and score 0, which is bad.\n\nI can eat one food this turn.\n\nPossible moves from (2,3):\n\n- Up: to (2,4) - but y=4 is within 1 to 6? Grid: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6? Let's see coordinates.\n\nx from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so valid x: 1 to 6.\n\nSimilarly y: 1 to 6, since y=0 and y=7 walls.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), which is within 1-6.\n\nSo grid cells: x=1,2,3,4,5,6 and y=1,2,3,4,5,6 except where walls or obstacles.\n\n(4,6) is obstacle, so not accessible.\n\nNow head at (2,3).\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (2,3) to (2,4) - y=4, which is valid, no wall, and no food there? Food is at (1,2), (3,5), (2,2), (5,2). (2,4) has no food.\n\n- D: to (2,2) - (2,2) has food! Value 9, life span 1.\n\n- L: to (1,3) - (1,3) has no food? Food at (1,2), not (1,3).\n\n- R: to (3,3) - (3,3) no food? Food at (3,5), not (3,3).\n\nAlso, cannot move R because current direction L, moving R is opposite, so not allowed. So only U, D, L are possible.\n\nSo actions: U to (2,4), D to (2,2) with food, L to (1,3).\n\nIf I move D to (2,2), I eat the food at (2,2), which is positive, value 9, so I gain score +9, and snake grows to length 2: head at (2,2), and tail at previous position (2,3). Since I moved down, new head position (2,2), and the segment that was head is now body at (2,3).\n\nAfter eating, length increases, so positions become [(2,2), (2,3)] for the next turn.\n\nIf I move L to (1,3), no food, so snake remains length 1, head at (1,3).\n\nIf I move U to (2,4), no food, head at (2,4).\n\nBut all other food will disappear after this turn since life span 1, so if I don't eat one now, I miss all food, and no food left.\n\n(5,2) is far, I can't reach it this turn from (2,3).\n\nDistances: from (2,3) to (1,2) is |dx|=1, |dy|=1, so adjacent, but I need to move directly to it.\n\nTo reach (1,2) from (2,3), I need to move down-left or something, but in one move, I can only go to adjacent cell in U/D/L/R.\n\nFrom (2,3), (1,2) is adjacent? (2,3) to (1,2): x-1, y-1, which is diagonal, not horizontal/vertical. In grid, moves are only U/D/L/R, so adjacent means sharing edge, not corner. So (1,2) is not adjacent to (2,3); they are diagonal.\n\nLet's list adjacent cells:\n\nFrom (2,3):\n\n- Up: (2,4)\n\n- Down: (2,2)\n\n- Left: (1,3)\n\n- Right: (3,3) but cannot due to direction.\n\nSo only (2,4), (2,2), (1,3) are possible.\n\n(2,2) has food.\n\n(1,3) no food.\n\n(2,4) no food.\n\nFood at (1,2) is not reachable in one move; it's at (1,2), which is adjacent to (1,3) or (2,2), etc., but from (2,3), I can only go to (2,2), (2,4), or (1,3), not directly to (1,2).\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) is at (3,5), from (2,3), I can go to (3,3) but not allowed, or (2,4), then to (3,4) etc., but not in one move.\n\n(5,2) far away.\n\nSo only possible food to eat this turn is at (2,2) by moving down.\n\nIf I move to (2,2), I eat it.\n\nOtherwise, I eat nothing.\n\nSince all food disappears after this turn, I should eat the food at (2,2) to get points.\n\nBut value is 9, same as others except (5,2) is 10, but I can't reach it.\n\n(5,2) value 10, but life span 1, so only available turn 1, I can't reach from (2,3) in one move.\n\nSo best to eat (2,2) for +9.\n\nNow, after eating, snake grows to length 2: positions [(2,2), (2,3)] with head at (2,2), and I moved down, so direction is now D (down).\n\nNow, for future turns, since all food is gone, and no new food mentioned, I need to survive, but with no food, I can move around without growing, but I need to avoid walls and self-collision.\n\nBut self-collision: with length 2, head and tail, I can move to where tail is, because tail will move away.\n\nFor example, from [(2,2), (2,3)], head at (2,2), direction down.\n\nPossible moves: not opposite, so current direction down, so cannot move up (U).\n\nCan move L, R, or D.\n\nD to (2,1): but y=1 is border? y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 is valid? y=0 is wall, so y=1 is valid cell, I think. Walls are at the border cells, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, so cannot move there.\n\nSo (2,1): y=1, which is not y=0, so it should be valid? y=0 is wall, so y=1 is the first row, accessible.\n\nSimilarly, x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6.\n\nInternal obstacle (4,6).\n\nSo from (2,2), head.\n\nMove D to (2,1): is this wall? y=1, not y=0, so should be ok.\n\nMove L to (1,2)\n\nMove R to (3,2)\n\nCannot move U because opposite to current down direction? Current direction is down, moving up would be opposite, so not allowed.\n\nSo possible: D, L, R.\n\nNow, after moving, say to (2,1), then tail at (2,3) moves to the previous head position, which is (2,2), so new positions: head at (2,1), body at (2,2).\n\nSimilarly, if move L to (1,2), new head (1,2), body at (2,2), tail at (2,2) but body is one segment.\n\nPositions: after move to (1,2), head at (1,2), and body at (2,2) since tail moves to previous head.\n\nThe segment that was tail at (2,3) moves to where head was, (2,2).\n\nSo new snake: [(1,2), (2,2)] if I move left.\n\nBut (2,2) was where I ate food, but now it's body.\n\nBut no food left, so no eating.\n\nNow, the problem is, with no food, I can just move around forever? But eventually, I might hit a wall or myself if I grow, but no food, so length stays 2, and I can move safely as long as I don't hit walls or obstacles.\n\nFor example, I can move in circles or something.\n\nBut I need to think 5 turns ahead, but since no food, survival is easy.\n\nBut perhaps new food spawns? The state doesn't say, so I have to assume no new food for now.\n\nBut in the rules, it doesn't specify food spawning, so for planning, I should consider only current food.\n\nBut all food has life span 1, so after turn 1, no food.\n\nThen for turns 2,3,4,5,6, I just need to survive, which is easy with length 2.\n\nFor example, at turn 1, I eat (2,2) by moving D.\n\nThen turn 2: snake at [(2,2), (2,3)] head at (2,2) dir D.\n\nI can move, say, L to (1,2), then positions [(1,2), (2,2)]\n\nThen turn 3: head at (1,2), I can move U to (1,3), then [(1,3), (1,2)]? After moving to (1,3), head at (1,3), body at (1,2) since tail moves from (2,2) to previous head (1,2).\n\nPositions: from [(1,2), (2,2)], head (1,2), move U to (1,3), then new head (1,3), and the body segment (which was at (2,2)) moves to where head was, (1,2), so new snake [(1,3), (1,2)].\n\nThen I can move R to (2,3), etc.\n\nNo risk.\n\nBut this is boring, and I need to maximize score, but with no food, score doesn't increase.\n\nPerhaps I missed something. The food at (2,2) has life span 1, but is it the only one I can eat?\n\nAt turn 1, only (2,2) is accessible and has food.\n\nBut let's confirm the food positions: (1,2,9,1), (3,5,9,1), (2,2,9,1), (5,2,10,1)\n\n(2,2) is accessible, others not this turn.\n\n(1,2) is at (1,2), which is adjacent to (1,3) or (2,2), but from (2,3), I can go to (2,2) or (1,3).\n\nIf I go to (1,3), I don't eat, but (1,2) is below, so next turn I could go down to (1,2), but life span of food is 1, so at turn 2, it disappears.\n\nLife span: at turn 1, life span 1, so it is available only on turn 1, and disappears after turn 1, so on turn 2, it's gone.\n\nSimilarly for all.\n\nSo if I don't eat at turn 1, I lose the food.\n\nTherefore, I must eat at turn 1 to get any points.\n\nSo best to eat (2,2) by moving down.\n\nThen for future turns, since no food, I just need to survive.\n\nBut let's think about the internal obstacle and walls.\n\nAlso, for long-term, but no food, so survival is key.\n\nPerhaps new food will spawn, but it's not specified, so I should output actions for a few turns.\n\nThe answer format is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but how many? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but output format shows \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but doesn't specify how many turns to output.\n\nProbably, I need to output for the current turn and a few ahead, but since the state might change, I think for this response, I need to provide the action for turn 1, and perhaps plan for future turns assuming no new food, or something.\n\nBut to think ahead, I need to consider possibilities.\n\nPerhaps I should move in a way that keeps options open, but with no food, it doesn't matter.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (5,2) has value 10, higher than others, but I can't reach it this turn.\n\nDistance from (2,3) to (5,2) is |5-2|=3 in x, |2-3|=1 in y, so min moves 4, but life span 1, so only available turn 1, can't reach.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) is |3-2|=1, |5-3|=2, min moves 3, not reachable in one turn.\n\n(1,2) is |1-2|=1, |2-3|=1, but not adjacent in grid terms; it's diagonal, not reachable directly.\n\nSo only (2,2) is reachable and has food.\n\nSo I must move down to eat it.\n\nThen for turn 2, snake at [(2,2), (2,3)] head at (2,2) dir D.\n\nPossible moves: L to (1,2), R to (3,2), D to (2,1).\n\nAll safe, no food.\n\nSay I move L to (1,2), then positions [(1,2), (2,2)] head at (1,2) dir L (since I moved left).\n\nThen turn 3, from (1,2), can move U to (1,3), D to (1,1), or L to (0,2) but x=0 is wall, so cannot move L. x=0 wall, so only U or D.\n\nCurrent direction L, so can move U or D or L, but L to (0,2) is wall, so invalid. So only U or D.\n\nU to (1,3), D to (1,1).\n\nSay U to (1,3), positions [(1,3), (1,2)] head at (1,3) dir U.\n\nThen turn 4, from (1,3), can move U to (1,4), D to (1,2) but (1,2) is body, but since it's the tail, and I move, tail will move away, so I can move to (1,2) only if it's the tail, which it is, so it's safe.\n\nCollision rules: head touches any body segment except that it can move to the tail cell because the tail moves.\n\nHere, from (1,3), moving D to (1,2): (1,2) is occupied by the tail. When I move to (1,2), at the same time, the tail moves to the previous head position, so no collision; it's allowed.\n\nSimilarly, can move U to (1,4), or R to (2,3), or L to (0,3) wall, so invalid. x=0 wall, so only U, D, R.\n\nCurrent direction U, so can move U, D, R? Not opposite, opposite to U is D, but D is allowed because it's not instant reverse if I change direction; the rule is no instant reverse, meaning I cannot move opposite to the current direction on the very next turn.\n\nFor example, if moving U, I cannot move D next turn.\n\nBut here, at turn 4, head at (1,3), direction U, so I can move U, L, R, but not D, because D is opposite to U.\n\nAllowed moves: not opposite to current direction.\n\nCurrent direction U, so opposite is D, so cannot move D.\n\nCan move U (continue), L (left), R (right).\n\nBut L to (0,3) wall, invalid.\n\nSo only U to (1,4) or R to (2,3).\n\n(2,3) is empty, I think.\n\nPositions: [(1,3), (1,2)], so (2,3) is free.\n\nSo move U to (1,4) or R to (2,3).\n\nSay move R to (2,3), then new head (2,3), body at (1,3), tail moved to (1,3)? When head moves to (2,3), the tail moves from (1,2) to where head was, (1,3), so new positions [(2,3), (1,3)].\n\nThen head at (2,3) dir R (since I moved right).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut all this is with no food, so no score increase.\n\nTo maximize score, since only one food available and I eat it, score is 9.\n\nBut there is (5,2) with value 10, but I can't eat it.\n\nPerhaps I can not eat at turn 1 and hope for new food, but no new food guaranteed.\n\nLife span: for (5,2), life span 10? Let's check the input.\n\n\" (5, 2, 10, 1) \" so value 10, life span 1, so only turn 1.\n\nSimilarly all life span 1.\n\nSo I must eat at turn 1 to get points.\n\nSo best to eat (2,2) for 9 points.\n\nBut let's see the value: (2,2) value 9, same as others except (5,2) 10, but unreachable.\n\n(1,2) value 9, but not reachable this turn.\n\nSo no choice.\n\nPerhaps I can move to a position to eat multiple, but only one per turn.\n\nOr, since life span 1, only one chance.\n\nSo for turn 1, move D to (2,2) to eat food.\n\nThen for turn 2, I need to choose a move.\n\nBut since no food, any move is fine, as long as safe.\n\nBut to think ahead, I should move in a way that I don't trap myself, but with open grid, it's easy.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), but far away.\n\nSo let's plan for 5 turns.\n\nTurn 1: move D to (2,2) eat food, score +9, snake now [(2,2), (2,3)] head dir D.\n\nTurn 2: from (2,2) dir D, possible moves: L to (1,2), R to (3,2), D to (2,1).\n\nAll safe. Say I move L to (1,2), then positions [(1,2), (2,2)] head at (1,2) dir L.\n\nTurn 3: from (1,2) dir L, can move U to (1,3), D to (1,1), or L to (0,2) invalid. So U or D.\n\nSay move U to (1,3), positions [(1,3), (1,2)] head at (1,3) dir U.\n\nTurn 4: from (1,3) dir U, can move U to (1,4), or R to (2,3), or L to (0,3) invalid. Cannot move D opposite.\n\nSo U to (1,4) or R to (2,3).\n\nSay move R to (2,3), positions [(2,3), (1,3)] head at (2,3) dir R.\n\nTurn 5: from (2,3) dir R, can move U to (2,4), D to (2,2), R to (3,3), or L to (1,3) but (1,3) is body, but it's the tail? Positions [(2,3), (1,3)], so tail is at (1,3), head at (2,3).\n\nMove L to (1,3): (1,3) is occupied by tail, so I can move there because tail will move away.\n\nWhen I move to (1,3), tail moves to (2,3), so no collision.\n\nCan move U, D, R.\n\nU to (2,4), D to (2,2), R to (3,3).\n\nAll fine.\n\nBut this is arbitrary.\n\nTo be more strategic, since the grid has an obstacle at (4,6), but it's not relevant now.\n\nPerhaps for long-term, I should move towards the center or something, but with no food, it doesn't matter.\n\nAnother thought: the food at (3,5) and (1,2) have life span 1, but I can't eat them, so they vanish.\n\nBut maybe new food will spawn after, but not specified.\n\nI think I should just eat the food at turn 1 and then move safely.\n\nBut the problem says \"maximize score\", and with only one food, score is 9.\n\nBut (5,2) has value 10, so if I could eat it, better, but I can't.\n\nUnless I don't eat at turn 1 and move towards it, but life span 1, so on turn 2, it's gone.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nPerhaps the life span is longer? Let's double-check the input.\n\n\"Food Positions, Life Span and Value:\n- (1, 2, 9, 1)\n- (3, 5, 9, 1)\n- (2, 2, 9, 1)\n- (5, 2, 10, 1)\"\n\nSo for (5,2,10,1), value 10, life span 1.\n\nSimilarly all life span 1.\n\nSo I must accept that.\n\nBut let's confirm the life span interpretation.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn 1, life span 1, so it disappears after turn 1, meaning on turn 2, it's gone.\n\nAvailable only on turn 1.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, for turn 1, I should move down to eat (2,2).\n\nThen for turn 2, I need to choose a direction.\n\nSince I need to output multiple turns, I'll plan a path.\n\nPerhaps I can move towards the area where food might spawn, but not specified.\n\nTo avoid the obstacle, but (4,6) is far.\n\nLet's list the coordinates.\n\nGrid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (4,6) is obstacle, so not accessible.\n\n(4,6) is at x=4,y=6, which is top row, y=6.\n\ny from 1 to 6, y=6 is valid, but (4,6) blocked.\n\nFrom (2,2) after eating, I can move left to (1,2) or right to (3,2) or down to (2,1).\n\nSay I move right to (3,2) to be more central.\n\nTurn 1: move D to (2,2) eat food.\n\nSnake: [(2,2), (2,3)] head dir D.\n\nTurn 2: move R to (3,2), then positions [(3,2), (2,2)] head at (3,2) dir R.\n\nTurn 3: from (3,2) dir R, can move U to (3,3), D to (3,1), R to (4,2), or L to (2,2) but (2,2) is body, tail, so can move L to (2,2) safely.\n\nSay move U to (3,3), positions [(3,3), (3,2)] head at (3,3) dir U.\n\nTurn 4: from (3,3) dir U, can move U to (3,4), L to (2,3), R to (4,3), or D opposite, not allowed.\n\nSay move U to (3,4), positions [(3,4), (3,3)] head dir U.\n\nTurn 5: from (3,4) dir U, can move U to (3,5), but (3,5) had food, but it's gone, or L to (2,4), R to (4,4), or D not allowed.\n\nU to (3,5): (3,5) was food but disappeared, so no issue.\n\nBut (3,5) is within grid, y=5, not wall.\n\nSimilarly, I can continue.\n\nBut no food.\n\nSo for output, I need to specify actions.\n\nAlso, for turn 1, action is D.\n\nThen for turn 2, I need to choose, say R.\n\nBut since the answer format is to box the actions.\n\nPerhaps I should think about the tail reward danger, but with length 2, it's not an issue yet.\n\nTail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut here, no food after turn 1, so no problem.\n\nSo I think for turn 1, move D.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I'll define a path.\n\nTo make it simple, let's move towards the center.\n\nCurrent after turn 1: head at (2,2) dir D.\n\nMove R to (3,2) turn 2.\n\nThen from (3,2) dir R, move U to (3,3) turn 3.\n\nThen from (3,3) dir U, move U to (3,4) turn 4.\n\nThen from (3,4) dir U, move U to (3,5) turn 5.\n\nBut (3,5) is valid.\n\nThen turn 6, etc.\n\nBut no need.\n\nSince I need to output 5 turns ahead, from turn 1 to turn 5 or something.\n\nThe output should start from turn 1.\n\nLet's list:\n\nTurn 1: D (down) to eat (2,2)\n\nThen turn 2: from (2,2) dir D, move R to (3,2)\n\nTurn 3: from (3,2) dir R, move U to (3,3)\n\nTurn 4: from (3,3) dir U, move U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 5: from (3,4) dir U, move U to (3,5)\n\nAll safe.\n\nI could move differently.\n\nBut I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if new food spawns near, but not known.\n\nSo for the answer, I'll go with that.\n\nBut in the state, there is food at (3,5), but it disappears after turn 1, so on turn 5, it's long gone.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 1: D\n\nTurn 2: R\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nBut for turn 4 and 5, moving U, from (3,3) to (3,4) then (3,5).\n\nYes.\n\nTo avoid the obstacle, (4,6) is at y=6, so if I go to (3,5), I can go to (3,6) but y=6 is border? y=7 is wall, so y=6 is valid, but (4,6) is obstacle, so (3,6) is free.\n\nBut in my path, I don't go there.\n\nNot necessary.\n\nI think it's ok.\n\nSo for the boxed answer.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 1):**\n- **Grid**: 8x8 grid (valid cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6) with walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacle at (4,6).\n- **Snake**: Head at (2,3), direction left (L). Only one segment (length 1), so no body collision risk yet.\n- **Food**: All food has life span 1, meaning it disappears after turn 1 if not eaten. Available food:\n  - (1,2): value 9 (positive)\n  - (3,5): value 9 (positive)\n  - (2,2): value 9 (positive) — adjacent and reachable this turn\n  - (5,2): value 10 (positive) — too far to reach in one move\n- **Constraints**: Current direction is L, so cannot move right (R) on turn 1 (no instant reverse).\n\n**Key Observations for Turn 1:**\n- Only (2,2) is reachable and has food this turn. Moving down (D) to (2,2) eats the positive food (+9 score, snake grows to length 2).\n- Other food cannot be reached this turn and will disappear after turn 1.\n- After eating, snake positions become [(2,2), (2,3)] with head direction down (D) for turn 2.\n- No food remains after turn 1, so the priority is survival (avoid walls, obstacles, and self-collision). With length 2, the snake can safely move into the tail cell since the tail moves away.\n\n**5-Turn Lookahead Plan (Prioritizing Survival and Open Space):**\n- **Turn 1**: Eat (2,2) by moving down (D) to gain +9 score. This is the only viable food option.\n- **Turns 2-5**: No food exists, so focus on moving to open areas to avoid dead ends and maintain flexibility. The internal obstacle at (4,6) is not an immediate threat. Move towards the center (e.g., x=3-4, y=3-4) for more maneuverability.\n  - **Turn 2**: From (2,2) dir D, move right (R) to (3,2) to head toward the center. Avoids left (near wall at x=0) and down (near wall at y=0).\n  - **Turn 3**: From (3,2) dir R, move up (U) to (3,3) to continue toward center. Avoids down (near wall) and left (backtracking).\n  - **Turn 4**: From (3,3) dir U, move up (U) to (3,4) to explore upper areas. Avoids down (opposite direction, not allowed).\n  - **Turn 5**: From (3,4) dir U, move up (U) to (3,5) to stay clear of obstacles. (3,5) is safe and open.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- **Turn 1**: No risks (no body, walls far).\n- **Turns 2-5**: All moves are safe:\n  - No walls or obstacles in the path.\n  - Length 2 allows moving into tail cell safely (e.g., if needed, but not in this plan).\n  - Direction changes respect no-instant-reverse rule.\n- **Long-term**: After turn 5, the snake is at (3,5) with direction U, in a flexible position. If new food spawns, it can be pursued.\n\n**Actions:**\n- Turn 1: Move down (D) to eat (2,2) for immediate score.\n- Turns 2-5: Move to open grid areas for survival.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 1\\text{: D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 2\\text{: R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 3\\text{: U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 4\\text{: U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 5\\text{: U}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm the AI playing Snake. I need to maximize my score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I must think at least 5 turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nThe current state is:\n\n- Turn: t1 = 2\n\n- Walls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\n- Snake positions: Head at (2,2), body at (2,3). So the snake is two segments long, moving downward (direction D).\n\n- Food:\n\n  - (1,2) with value 1, life span 8 (so it disappears after 8 turns, including this one, so it has 7 turns left? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 2, life span 8 means it will disappear after turn 9? Let me clarify: life span N means it disappears after N turns from now? The input says \"life_span\" and \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\n    - For food at (1,2): life span 8 at turn 2. So countdown starts at 8, decreases by 1 each turn. So at turn 2, countdown=8; turn 3, countdown=7; ... down to turn 9, countdown=0, so it disappears after turn 9? \"Disappears after N turns\" – I think \"after N turns\" means it lasts for N turns, so if life span is N at turn t, it will be gone at turn t + N.\n\n    Similarly, for (3,5): life span 8, value 1\n\n    (5,2): life span 9, value 1\n\nAll food has value +1, so positive food.\n\nGrid size: walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so the playable area is from x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? Let's see: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so coordinates are from 0 to 7 inclusive, but walls at boundaries. So playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. But internal obstacle at (4,6), so (4,6) is blocked.\n\nSnake head at (2,2), moving down. Current direction is D, so I can't move up on the next turn because of no instant reverse. Possible moves: since moving down, I can go down, left, or right, but not up.\n\nFrom (2,2), moving down would go to (2,1). But y=0 is wall, so y=1 should be playable? y=0 is wall, so y=1 is the bottom row? Let's define coordinates.\n\nAssuming (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? Typically in grids, (0,0) might be top-left or bottom-left. But here, snake head at (2,2), and moving down to (2,3)? Positions: snake positions [(2,2), (2,3)]. Head is (2,2), and body is (2,3). Since head direction is D (down), that means moving down from (2,2) would decrease y? I need to clarify the coordinate system.\n\nHead direction D (down), and positions: head (2,2), body (2,3). If moving down decreases y, then from (2,2) down to (2,1), but body is at (2,3), which has higher y, so y=3 must be above y=2? So probably, y increases upwards, like in math coordinates. So (2,2) to (2,3) is up, but head direction is down? Inconsistency.\n\nSnake positions: head (2,2), body (2,3). If head direction is D (down), that means the snake was moving down to reach (2,2), so previous position was above, like (2,3) or something. Positions are listed head first, then body segments. So [(2,2), (2,3)] means head is at (2,2), and the next segment, which was the previous head, is at (2,3). Since head direction is down, it was moving from (2,3) to (2,2), decreasing y. So y decreases as we go down. So (2,3) is above (2,2), and moving down to (2,2) means decreasing y.\n\nStandard grid: let's assume (0,0) is bottom-left corner. So y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top. Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 and y=7 are walls. Playable y from 1 to 6.\n\nSimilarly, x=0 left wall, x=7 right wall, playable x from 1 to 6.\n\nSo head at (2,2), which is x=2, y=2. Moving down (D) to, say, (2,1) which is lower y.\n\nBody at (2,3), which is above, y=3.\n\nNow, possible moves from current head (2,2) with direction D:\n\n- Down: to (2,1) – this should be valid, y=1 is playable.\n\n- Left: to (1,2)\n\n- Right: to (3,2)\n\n- Up: to (2,3) – but (2,3) is occupied by body, and also, moving up is reverse, which is not allowed because current direction is down, so instant reverse to up is forbidden.\n\nNo instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction D (down), so cannot move U (up) on next turn.\n\nSo possible actions: D, L, R.\n\nNow, food locations:\n\n- (1,2): value 1, life span 8. At turn 2, so it will disappear after 8 more turns? \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\".\n\nAt turn t, with life span N, it means the food is present for N turns, including turn t. So countdown from N to 1, and after turn t + N - 1, it disappears? Let's see.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for food at turn t with life_span L, at turn t, countdown = L. After turn t, if not eaten, countdown becomes L-1 at turn t+1, and so on, until countdown=0, and it disappears before the next turn or something.\n\nBut in terms of when it can be eaten: it exists as long as countdown > 0.\n\nFor (1,2) at turn 2, life span 8, so countdown=8. It can be eaten from turn 2 to turn 9? After turn 9, it disappears.\n\nTurn 2: countdown=8\n\nTurn 3: countdown=7\n\n...\n\nTurn 9: countdown=1\n\nTurn 10: countdown=0, disappears before turn 10? I think \"disappears after N turns\" means after N turns from now, it is gone.\n\nAt turn t, food with life_span N will be gone at the start of turn t + N.\n\nSimilarly, for (3,5): life span 8, at turn 2, gone at turn 10.\n\n(5,2): life span 9, at turn 2, gone at turn 11.\n\nAll value +1.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead. Turn 2 now, so up to turn 7 or beyond.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So playable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), so (4,6) is blocked.\n\nSnake: head (2,2), body (2,3). So tail is at (2,3).\n\nFood: (1,2), (3,5), (5,2)\n\n(1,2) is at x=1,y=2\n\n(3,5) is x=3,y=5\n\n(5,2) is x=5,y=2\n\nNow, head at (2,2), so (1,2) is directly left, adjacent.\n\n(5,2) is at same y, x=5.\n\n(3,5) is up and right.\n\nPossible moves from (2,2): L to (1,2), D to (2,1), R to (3,2)\n\nIf I move L to (1,2), that's where food is. But is it safe? (1,2) has food, and if I eat it, snake grows, so new length 3. But I need to check if it's under body or something. Currently, snake body is at (2,3), not at (1,2), so it's free. But \"food can spawn under body\" but here it's not under body.\n\nMoving to (1,2): head moves to (1,2), which has food, so I eat it, snake grows to length 3. New positions: head at (1,2), then previous head (2,2) becomes body, and tail at (2,3). So body segments: (2,2) and (2,3).\n\nNow, is there any danger? Tail is at (2,3), which is not adjacent to head (1,2). (1,2) and (2,3) are not adjacent; adjacent cells are up, down, left, right, so (1,2) and (2,3) are diagonal, not adjacent. So no tail reward danger.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nIf I move L to (1,2), I eat food, score +1, length 3.\n\nThen from there, possible moves.\n\nBut let's see other options.\n\nMove D to (2,1): (2,1) is empty, no food, so no growth. Then snake moves: head to (2,1), body to (2,2), tail (2,3) moves? When snake moves without eating, tail moves forward.\n\nCurrent positions: head (2,2), body (2,3)\n\nAfter move D to (2,1), head moves to (2,1), body segment that was at (2,2) is now the neck, and tail (2,3) moves to where the neck was? Standard snake: when moving, head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n\nSo after move D to (2,1): new head at (2,1), the segment that was at (2,2) is now at position 1, and the segment that was at (2,3) moves to (2,2), so new positions: [(2,1), (2,2)] with head direction down.\n\nSimilarly, if move R to (3,2): (3,2) has no food, so new positions: head (3,2), body (2,2), tail gone? Positions: [(3,2), (2,2)] since length 2, tail was (2,3) but since no eat, tail moves off, so body is only (2,2) now? Length 2 snake: after move without eat, head to new, the single body segment moves to where head was.\n\nInitial: segments A(head), B(tail)\n\nAfter move: new head C, and B moves to A's old position, so now segments C(head), A(body)\n\nIn this case, from [(2,2), (2,3)], move to (3,2): head to (3,2), body to (2,2), so positions [(3,2), (2,2)]\n\nSimilarly for other moves.\n\nNow, back to choices.\n\nOption 1: Move L to (1,2) - eat food, grow to length 3, new head (1,2), body segments: (2,2) and (2,3)? After eating, the tail doesn't move, so new positions: head at (1,2), then the previous positions: (2,2) becomes first body, (2,3) becomes tail. So [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3)]\n\nHead at (1,2), direction from (2,2) to (1,2) is left, so new head direction L.\n\nThen from there, possible moves: U, D, L, but not R (reverse).\n\n(1,2) is at left border, x=1. Walls at x=0, so x=1 is playable.\n\nAdjacent cells: up (1,3), down (1,1), left? x=0 is wall, so cannot move left. Right to (2,2), but (2,2) is now occupied by body, so cannot move there.\n\nSo from (1,2), possible moves: U to (1,3), D to (1,1), or R to (2,2) but blocked by body, so only U or D.\n\n(1,3) is empty? Food is at (1,2) but we ate it, so gone. Other food at (3,5) and (5,2).\n\n(1,3): no food mentioned, so empty.\n\n(1,1): empty.\n\nBut moving U to (1,3): (1,3) is y=3, which is above, and body is at (2,3), which is different cell, so should be ok.\n\nSimilarly, D to (1,1).\n\nBut after moving to (1,2), we have body at (2,2) and (2,3), so (2,2) is adjacent to head (1,2), but it's a body segment, not tail.\n\nTail is at (2,3).\n\nNow, if I go U to (1,3), head to (1,3), then body moves: (1,2) becomes neck, (2,2) moves to (1,2)? After move without eat: head to new, each body segment moves forward.\n\nFrom positions [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3)] after eating.\n\nIf I move U to (1,3), and no food there, then: head moves to (1,3), the segment at (1,2) moves to where head was? Let's index: position 0: head (1,2), position 1: (2,2), position 2: tail (2,3)\n\nAfter move U to (1,3): new head at (1,3), then position 1 (which was (2,2)) moves to previous position 0, which is (1,2), but position 0 was (1,2), so now body segment 1 moves to (1,2). Then tail position 2 (2,3) moves to previous position 1, which was (2,2), so to (2,2).\n\nSo new positions: [(1,3), (1,2), (2,2)]\n\nHead at (1,3), direction U.\n\nSimilarly, if move D to (1,1), new positions [(1,1), (1,2), (2,2)]\n\nBut in both cases, the tail is at (2,2), which is not near head immediately.\n\nBut long-term, I might be cornered.\n\nNow, back to turn 2 decision.\n\nOther moves: move D to (2,1)\n\n(2,1) is empty, no food, so snake moves: head to (2,1), body to (2,2), tail (2,3) gone? Length 2, so after move: positions [(2,1), (2,2)] with head direction D.\n\nThen from (2,1), possible moves: L to (1,1), R to (3,1), U to (2,2) but (2,2) is body, so cannot, or D to (2,0) but y=0 wall, so cannot. So only L or R.\n\n(2,1) y=1, down would be y=0 wall, so cannot move D. Up to (2,2) is body, blocked. So only left to (1,1) or right to (3,1).\n\nSimilarly, move R to (3,2): (3,2) empty, no food, new positions [(3,2), (2,2)] head direction R.\n\nThen from (3,2), possible moves: U to (3,3), D to (3,1), L to (2,2) body blocked, R to (4,2). (4,2) is playable? x=4,y=2, and no wall, internal obstacle at (4,6), not here.\n\nSo U, D, R possible.\n\nNow, food available: (1,2) is adjacent left, can be eaten now.\n\n(5,2) is at (5,2), which is to the right, same y.\n\n(3,5) is at (3,5), which is up and right.\n\nLife spans: (1,2) life span 8, so gone after turn 10? Turn 2 + 8 = 10, gone at turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) gone turn 10, (5,2) gone turn 11.\n\nSince we have time, but I need to think strategically.\n\nAlso, the grid is small, 6x6 playable area.\n\nPlayable cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to6, total 36 cells, minus obstacle at (4,6), so 35 cells.\n\nSnake length 2, so plenty of space.\n\nBut with growth, it can get tight.\n\nNow, immediate choice: moving to (1,2) eats food, but it might lead to being in corner.\n\nMoving down to (2,1) or right to (3,2) keeps options open.\n\nBut let's think 5 turns ahead.\n\nI am at turn 2.\n\nI need to plan actions for turn 2,3,4,5,6,7 at least.\n\nBut the answer should be a sequence of actions starting from turn 2.\n\nAnswer format: Turn 2: action, Turn 3: action, etc.\n\nBut I need to decide based on future.\n\nSince food is valuable, eating (1,2) now might be good, but let's see the risk.\n\nIf I eat (1,2), I go to (1,2), length 3, and then I can only move up or down from there.\n\nSay I move up to (1,3), then positions [(1,3), (1,2), (2,2)]\n\nThen from (1,3), I can move U to (1,4), D to (1,2) body blocked, L wall, R to (2,3). (2,3) is currently tail at (2,2)? Positions: head (1,3), body (1,2), tail (2,2)\n\n(2,3) is empty, I think.\n\nSo from (1,3), possible: U to (1,4), R to (2,3), or D to (1,2) blocked.\n\nSo U or R.\n\nIf I go U to (1,4), new positions: head (1,4), body (1,3), tail (1,2) since body moves: after move, head to (1,4), body segment at (1,3) to (1,3), tail at (1,2) to (1,2)? Index: pos0 (1,3) head, pos1 (1,2), pos2 (2,2)\n\nAfter move U to (1,4): new head (1,4), pos1 moves to prev pos0 (1,3), so to (1,3), pos2 moves to prev pos1 (1,2), so to (1,2). New positions [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]\n\nAll on x=1.\n\nThen from (1,4), I can move U to (1,5), D to (1,3) body blocked, L wall, R to (2,4).\n\nSo U or R.\n\nIf I keep going up, I might reach (1,6), but y=6, and above y=7 wall, so (1,6) is top.\n\nBut internal obstacle at (4,6), but (1,6) is not blocked.\n\nFrom (1,4), if I go U to (1,5), then to (1,6), then from (1,6), only down or right, since up to y=7 wall.\n\nBut body might be below.\n\nThis seems messy.\n\nFrom (1,2) after eating, instead of up, I could go down to (1,1).\n\n(1,1) is bottom-left corner.\n\nThen from (1,1), move U to (1,2) body blocked, D to (1,0) wall, L wall, R to (2,1). So only R to (2,1).\n\nThen to (2,1), and so on.\n\nBut I have body at (1,2) and (2,2) or something.\n\nAfter eating at (1,2), positions [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3)]\n\nMove D to (1,1): head to (1,1), body: pos1 (2,2) moves to prev head (1,2), so to (1,2), tail (2,3) moves to prev pos1 (2,2), so to (2,2). New positions [(1,1), (1,2), (2,2)]\n\nThen from (1,1), only possible move R to (2,1), since U blocked, D wall, L wall.\n\nMove R to (2,1): head to (2,1), body: pos1 (1,2) moves to (1,1), tail (2,2) moves to (1,2)? Prev pos1 was (1,2), so moves to (1,2). New positions [(2,1), (1,1), (1,2)]\n\nHead at (2,1), direction from (1,1) to (2,1) is right, so R.\n\nThen from (2,1), can move U to (2,2), but (2,2) is occupied by tail? Positions: head (2,1), body (1,1), tail (1,2)\n\n(2,2) is empty now, I think.\n\n(2,2) is not occupied; in new positions, tail is at (1,2), so (2,2) free.\n\nSo from (2,1), possible moves: U to (2,2), D to (2,0) wall, L to (1,1) body blocked, R to (3,1).\n\nSo U or R.\n\nIf U to (2,2), which is empty, no food, then new positions: head (2,2), body (2,1), tail (1,1)\n\nThen from (2,2), etc.\n\nBut this is getting convoluted, and I'm in the corner with limited moves.\n\nNot ideal for long-term survival.\n\nIf at (1,2) after eating, I move up to (1,3) as before, then from (1,3) I can move right to (2,3).\n\nFrom (1,3), positions [(1,3), (1,2), (2,2)] head at (1,3)\n\nMove R to (2,3): (2,3) empty, no food, so move: head to (2,3), body pos1 (1,2) moves to prev head (1,3), so to (1,3), tail (2,2) moves to prev pos1 (1,2), so to (1,2). New positions [(2,3), (1,3), (1,2)]\n\nHead at (2,3), direction R.\n\nThen from (2,3), can move U to (2,4), D to (2,2), L to (1,3) body blocked, R to (3,3).\n\n(2,2) is empty, so D possible.\n\nEtc.\n\nBetter than being stuck at left.\n\nBut still, I used a move to eat the food and then had to move away.\n\nNow, alternative: don't eat (1,2) now, move down or right.\n\nMove D to (2,1).\n\nFrom (2,2) move D to (2,1): no eat, new positions [(2,1), (2,2)] head direction D.\n\nThen from (2,1), as before, can move L to (1,1) or R to (3,1).\n\nSay move R to (3,1): head to (3,1), body to (2,1)? Positions: [(3,1), (2,1)]\n\nHead at (3,1), direction R.\n\nThen from (3,1), can move U to (3,2), D to (3,0) wall, L to (2,1) body blocked, R to (4,1).\n\nSo U or R.\n\n(3,2) has no food, but food at (3,5) and (5,2).\n\nMove U to (3,2): head to (3,2), body to (3,1)? New positions [(3,2), (3,1)]\n\nThen from (3,2), can move U to (3,3), D to (3,1) body blocked, L to (2,2), R to (4,2).\n\n(2,2) is empty, L possible.\n\nSimilarly, I can go towards the food at (3,5) or (5,2).\n\n(3,5) is at y=5, x=3.\n\nFrom (3,2), moving up step by step.\n\nBut let's think about the food life spans. They have many turns left, so I can take my time.\n\nHowever, there might be a risk if I don't eat soon, but no immediate danger.\n\nAnother point: the food at (1,2) is at the border, and if I don't eat it, it will disappear in 8 turns, but I can come back later, but with a longer snake, it might be harder to reach.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut (5,2) has longer life span.\n\nPrioritize long-term survival, so avoid risky moves.\n\nEating (1,2) now might force me into a corner, which is risky for long term.\n\nMoving down or right keeps me central.\n\nMove R to (3,2).\n\nFrom (2,2) move R to (3,2): no eat, new positions [(3,2), (2,2)] head direction R.\n\nThen from (3,2), I can move U to (3,3), D to (3,1), or R to (4,2), since L to (2,2) body blocked.\n\n(4,2) is playable, no obstacle.\n\nFood at (3,5) is above, so I can start moving up.\n\nFor example, from (3,2) move U to (3,3), then to (3,4), then to (3,5) to eat.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nTurn 2: move R to (3,2) — no eat, positions [(3,2), (2,2)]\n\nTurn 3: from (3,2), move U to (3,3) — no food, positions [(3,3), (3,2)]\n\nTurn 4: move U to (3,4) — no food, positions [(3,4), (3,3)]\n\nTurn 5: move U to (3,5) — eat food at (3,5), grow to length 3, positions [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3)] head direction U.\n\nNow, at (3,5), y=5, near top. y=6 above, y=7 wall.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), but not relevant yet.\n\nFrom (3,5), possible moves: U to (3,6), D to (3,4) body blocked, L to (2,5), R to (4,5).\n\n(3,4) is body, blocked; (3,6) is playable, (2,5), (4,5) playable.\n\nBut (4,6) is obstacle, but (4,5) is fine.\n\nU to (3,6): (3,6) is top row, y=6.\n\nThen from there, can move L, R, or D, but not U to y=7 wall.\n\nBut body below.\n\nSimilarly, I can go to (4,5) or (2,5).\n\nNow, after eating at turn 5, I have food at (5,2) and (1,2) still available? (1,2) life span 8 from turn 2, gone after turn 10, so at turn 5, still there.\n\nTurn 5 is turn 2+3=5, life span was 8, so countdown at turn 5: 8-3=5? Countdown decreases each turn.\n\nAt turn 2, countdown=8 for (1,2)\n\nTurn 3:7, turn4:6, turn5:5, so still there.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) life span 9, turn2:9, turn3:8, turn4:7, turn5:6, etc.\n\nSo from (3,5), I need to go down or sideways to reach other food.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nAnother option at turn 2: instead of going right, go down to (2,1).\n\nThen from (2,1), I can go left to (1,1) or right to (3,1).\n\nIf I go to (1,1), then to (1,2) to eat, but at turn 3.\n\nTurn 2: move D to (2,1), positions [(2,1), (2,2)]\n\nTurn 3: from (2,1), move L to (1,1) — no food, positions [(1,1), (2,1)]\n\nTurn 4: move U to (1,2) — eat food at (1,2), grow to length 3, positions [(1,2), (1,1), (2,1)] head direction U? From (1,1) to (1,2) is up, so U.\n\nThen similar to before, stuck at left with body below.\n\nThen from (1,2), can only move U to (1,3) or D to (1,1) blocked, so U to (1,3), then as before.\n\nWorse than eating directly at turn 2.\n\nIf from (2,1) at turn 3, move R to (3,1), then to (3,2), etc., similar to previous path but lower.\n\nBut food at (3,5) is up, so I need to go up.\n\nPerhaps the best is to go for (3,5) first, since it's closer in terms of vertical distance.\n\nFrom (2,2) to (3,5): Δx=1, Δy=3, so 3 moves up after going right.\n\nIn the first plan, with move R then U U U, I eat at turn 5.\n\nThen I can go for (5,2) or (1,2).\n\n(1,2) is at left, (5,2) at right.\n\nAfter eating at (3,5), I am at top, so going down to (5,2) might be better.\n\nFrom (3,5), move R to (4,5) or D to (3,4) but body, so not D.\n\nMove to (4,5): turn 6: from (3,5) move R to (4,5) — no food, positions head (4,5), body (3,5), tail (3,4)? After previous positions [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3)], move R to (4,5): head to (4,5), body segment at (3,5) moves to prev head (3,5)? Pos0 (3,5) head, pos1 (3,4), pos2 (3,3)\n\nMove R to (4,5): new head (4,5), pos1 moves to prev pos0 (3,5), so to (3,5), pos2 moves to prev pos1 (3,4), so to (3,4). New positions [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nHead at (4,5), direction R.\n\nThen from (4,5), can move U to (4,6), D to (4,4), L to (3,5) body blocked, R to (5,5).\n\n(4,6) is the internal obstacle? Internal obstacle at (4,6), so (4,6) is wall, cannot move there.\n\nSo from (4,5), possible: D to (4,4), or R to (5,5), or U to (4,6) but wall, blocked.\n\nL to (3,5) body blocked.\n\nSo D or R.\n\nMove D to (4,4): then I can go down to (4,3), etc., towards (5,2).\n\nOr move R to (5,5), then to (5,4), etc.\n\nBut food at (5,2) is at y=2, so I need to go down.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) is at left bottom.\n\nBut (1,2) disappears sooner, after turn 10, while (5,2) after turn 11.\n\nTurn 2+8=10 for (1,2), turn 2+9=11 for (5,2).\n\nAt turn 5, after eating (3,5), I have 5 turns to eat (1,2) and 6 for (5,2).\n\nBut with snake length 3, I can navigate.\n\nBut let's see if I can get both.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 2, move to (3,2) as before, but instead of going directly up, I can go to (5,2) first or something.\n\nFrom (2,2), move R to (3,2), then at turn 3, move R to (4,2), turn 4 move R to (5,2), eat at (5,2).\n\nLet's see.\n\nTurn 2: move R to (3,2) — no eat, positions [(3,2), (2,2)]\n\nTurn 3: move R to (4,2) — no food, positions [(4,2), (3,2)]\n\nTurn 4: move R to (5,2) — eat food at (5,2), grow to length 3, positions [(5,2), (4,2), (3,2)] head direction R.\n\nThen from (5,2), at x=5, right side. Walls x=7, so x=6 available.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,3), D to (5,1), L to (4,2) body blocked, R to (6,2).\n\n(4,2) is body, blocked, so U, D, R.\n\nThen I can go up towards (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is at (3,5), so from (5,2) to (3,5), need to go left and up.\n\nFor example, move U to (5,3), then U to (5,4), etc., but (3,5) is at x=3, so I need to go left.\n\nBut with body behind, it might be ok.\n\nTurn 5: from (5,2) move U to (5,3) — no food, positions [(5,3), (5,2), (4,2)]\n\nTurn 6: move U to (5,4) — no food, positions [(5,4), (5,3), (5,2)]\n\nTurn 7: move U to (5,5) — no food, positions [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3)]\n\nTurn 8: move L to (4,5) — no food, positions head (4,5), body (5,5)? After move L to (4,5): head to (4,5), body segment at (5,5) moves to prev head (5,5)? Positions before: pos0 (5,5) head, pos1 (5,4), pos2 (5,3)\n\nMove L to (4,5): new head (4,5), pos1 moves to prev pos0 (5,5), so to (5,5), pos2 moves to prev pos1 (5,4), so to (5,4). New positions [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4)]\n\nHead at (4,5), direction L.\n\nThen from (4,5), can move U to (4,6) but obstacle, blocked, D to (4,4), L to (3,5), R to (5,5) body blocked.\n\n(3,5) has food, so move L to (3,5) to eat.\n\nTurn 9: move L to (3,5) — eat, grow to length 4, positions head (3,5), then body (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)? After eating, tail doesn't move, so new positions: [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)]\n\nHead at (3,5), direction L.\n\nThen I have food at (1,2) still, but at turn 9, countdown for (1,2): at turn 2 countdown 8, turn 9 is 7 turns later, countdown 8-7=1, so at turn 9, countdown=1, after turn 9, it disappears, so I can still eat it on turn 9 or before.\n\nAt turn 9, I am at (3,5), (1,2) is at (1,2), which is far, and snake length 4, it might be hard to reach in one turn.\n\nTurn 9: I am at (3,5), (1,2) at (1,2), distance |3-1| + |5-2| = 2+3=5, so 5 moves away, but on turn 9 I can eat if I move, but I need to be adjacent.\n\nAt turn 9, I am at (3,5), (1,2) is not adjacent, so I cannot eat it on turn 9. After turn 9, it disappears, so I miss it.\n\nSimilarly, in the first plan, when I ate (3,5) at turn 5, at turn 5, (1,2) countdown=5, so I have until turn 9 to eat it.\n\nFrom (3,5) at turn 5, I can try to go to (1,2).\n\nBut from (3,5) to (1,2): Δx=2 left, Δy=3 down, so at least 5 moves, but with snake length 3, I need to navigate.\n\nFor example, from (3,5) move L to (2,5), then D to (2,4), D to (2,3), D to (2,2), then L to (1,2).\n\nBut (2,2) might be occupied or not.\n\nTurn 5: positions [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3)] after eating (3,5)\n\nMove L to (2,5): turn 6, move L to (2,5) — no food, positions [(2,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nTurn 7: move D to (2,4) — no food, positions [(2,4), (2,5), (3,5)]\n\nTurn 8: move D to (2,3) — no food, positions [(2,3), (2,4), (2,5)]\n\nTurn 9: move D to (2,2) — no food, positions [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4)]\n\nThen turn 10: move L to (1,2) — but (1,2) food should be gone? At turn 10, for (1,2) life span 8 from turn 2, disappears after turn 10, so at turn 10, it might be gone or can be eaten?\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" – at turn t + N it is gone.\n\nSo at turn 2 + 8 = turn 10, it disappears, so on turn 10, it is not there.\n\nCountdown: at turn 2 countdown=8, turn 3:7, ..., turn 9:1, turn 10:0, disappeared.\n\nSo on turn 9, countdown=1, can be eaten on turn 9.\n\nAt turn 9, I am at (2,2), and (1,2) is adjacent left, so I can move L to (1,2) on turn 9 to eat it.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 6: from (3,5) move L to (2,5)\n\nTurn 7: move D to (2,4)\n\nTurn 8: move D to (2,3)\n\nTurn 9: move D to (2,2) — but at turn 9, I am at (2,2), and (1,2) is left, so I can move to (1,2) on turn 10? No, on turn 9 I moved to (2,2), so at the end of turn 9, positions [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4)] head at (2,2)\n\nThen turn 10: move L to (1,2) — but (1,2) is gone on turn 10, so I cannot eat it.\n\nAt turn 9, before moving, head at (2,3) or where?\n\nTurn 8: after move D to (2,3), positions [(2,3), (2,4), (2,5)] head at (2,3)\n\nTurn 9: move to (2,2) or (1,2)?\n\nFrom (2,3), I can move to (2,2) or (1,3) or (3,3), etc.\n\nTo eat (1,2) on turn 9, I need to be at a cell adjacent to it on turn 9.\n\nOn turn 9, before moving, head at (2,3), which is not adjacent to (1,2). (1,2) is adjacent to (1,1), (1,3), (2,2), (0,2) but x=0 wall.\n\nSo from (2,3), I can move to (2,2) or (1,3) or (3,3), but not directly to (1,2).\n\n(1,2) is not adjacent to (2,3); (2,3) and (1,2) are diagonal.\n\nSo I cannot move to (1,2) from (2,3) in one move; I need to go to (2,2) or (1,3) first.\n\nIf I go to (2,2) on turn 9, then (1,2) is adjacent, but on turn 10, it is gone.\n\nIf I go to (1,3) on turn 9, then (1,2) is below, so on turn 10 I can move down to (1,2), but turn 10 it is gone.\n\nSo I cannot eat (1,2) because I arrive too late.\n\nSimilarly, in the other path, I might miss it.\n\nBut in the first plan where I ate (3,5) at turn 5, I could have gone directly to (1,2) but it takes 4 or 5 moves, and I only have until turn 9 to eat.\n\nFrom (3,5) at turn 5, to (1,2) in 4 moves: e.g., L to (2,5), D to (2,4), D to (2,3), L to (1,3), then D to (1,2) on turn 9.\n\nTurn 6: L to (2,5)\n\nTurn 7: D to (2,4)\n\nTurn 8: D to (2,3)\n\nTurn 9: L to (1,3) — not (1,2) yet\n\nThen turn 10: D to (1,2) but gone.\n\nIf from (2,3) on turn 8, I move to (1,3) instead of D to (2,3)? On turn 8 head at (2,4), move to (2,3) or (1,4) or (3,4), etc.\n\nTo reach (1,2) by turn 9.\n\nFrom (3,5) at turn 5, shortest path to (1,2) is 5 moves: e.g., L, D, D, L, D or something.\n\nBut turn 5 to turn 9 is 4 moves later, so on turn 9 I can be at (1,2) if I start on turn 6.\n\nTurn 5: at (3,5)\n\nTurn 6: move to (2,5)\n\nTurn 7: move to (2,4) or (1,5) etc.\n\nSay turn 6: move L to (2,5)\n\nTurn 7: move L to (1,5)\n\nTurn 8: move D to (1,4)\n\nTurn 9: move D to (1,3)\n\nThen turn 10: move D to (1,2) but gone.\n\nFrom (1,5) on turn 8, move D to (1,4), not to (1,2).\n\nTo be at (1,2) on turn 9, I need to be at (1,3), (2,2), or (1,1) on turn 8.\n\nFrom (3,5) on turn 5, in 3 moves, I can be at (1,3) or (2,2), etc.\n\nTurn 5: (3,5)\n\nTurn 6: move L to (2,5)\n\nTurn 7: move L to (1,5) or D to (2,4)\n\nIf move to (1,5), then turn 8 move D to (1,4), not (1,2).\n\nMove to (2,4) on turn 7, then turn 8 move L to (1,4) or D to (2,3)\n\nNot (1,2).\n\nFrom (2,4) on turn 8, move D to (2,3), then turn 9 move L to (1,3) or D to (2,2), but not (1,2).\n\nI cannot reach (1,2) by turn 9 from (3,5) in 4 moves because of Manhattan distance.\n\nMin moves: from (3,5) to (1,2) is |3-1| + |5-2| = 2+3=5 moves.\n\nTurn 5 to turn 9 is 4 moves (turn 6,7,8,9), so on turn 9 I can be at a cell 4 away, not 5, so I cannot reach (1,2) by turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, only if I start earlier.\n\nIf at turn 2, I go directly to (1,2) and eat it, then I can go for other food.\n\nBut I was concerned about being cornered.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (1,2) at turn 2, then move up or down to escape the corner.\n\nFor example, after eating at (1,2), move U to (1,3), then R to (2,3), then I can go to (3,5) or (5,2).\n\nLet's see.\n\nTurn 2: move L to (1,2) eat, positions [(1,2), (2,2), (2,3)] head L\n\nTurn 3: move U to (1,3) no eat, positions [(1,3), (1,2), (2,2)] head U\n\nTurn 4: move R to (2,3) no eat, positions [(2,3), (1,3), (1,2)] head R\n\nThen from (2,3), I can move U to (2,4), D to (2,2) but (2,2) is body? Positions: head (2,3), body (1,3), tail (1,2)\n\n(2,2) is empty, so D possible.\n\nOr U to (2,4), etc.\n\nThen I can go to (3,5) by moving U and R.\n\nFor example, turn 5: move U to (2,4)\n\nTurn 6: move U to (2,5)\n\nTurn 7: move R to (3,5) eat at (3,5), grow to length 4, positions [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4)] and body, etc.\n\nThen I have (5,2) left, with life span 9, gone after turn 11, so I have time.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can go down to (5,2).\n\nSimilarly, I ate two food and can go for third.\n\nIn this case, I ate (1,2) at turn 2, (3,5) at turn 7, and (5,2) can be eaten later.\n\nAt turn 7, (5,2) countdown: initial 9, turn 2 to turn 7 is 5 turns, countdown 9-5=4, so 4 turns left, can eat by turn 10.\n\nDistance from (3,5) to (5,2) is |3-5| + |5-2| = 2+3=5 moves, so possible in 5 moves, but with countdown 4, I can make it if I go directly.\n\nTurn 7: at (3,5)\n\nTurn 8: move R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 9: move R to (5,5) or D to (4,4), etc.\n\nSay turn 8: move R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 9: move D to (4,4)\n\nTurn 10: move D to (4,3)\n\nTurn 11: move D to (4,2) or R to (5,2), but (5,2) is at (5,2), so on turn 10, move to (5,2)?

After eating at (5,2), positions [(5,2), (4,2), (3,2)] head R\n\nTurn 5: move L to (4,2) but (4,2) is body, blocked, so cannot move L.\n\nOnly U, D, R.\n\nMove U to (5,3), then turn 6 move L to (4,3), etc., slow to (1,2).\n\nCannot reach in time.\n\nSo the only way to get all three is to eat (1,2) early and then the others quickly, but as above, it's tight for (5,2).\n\nPerhaps at turn 2, move down to (2,1), then to (3,1), then to (4,1), etc., but not efficient.\n\nI think it's impossible to get all three because of the distances and life spans.\n\nWith life span 8 and 9, and grid size, I can get two easily.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should get two.\n\nNow, for long-term survival, after eating food, I need to avoid colliding and have space.\n\nBut since no more food, after eating all possible, I can survive but no score.\n\nBut the game might continue with new food, but not specified.\n\nIn this state, only three food given, so after they are eaten or expired, no more, but snake can survive.\n\nBut score is from eating food.\n\nSo to maximize, I should eat as many as possible.\n\nBut here, I can eat two for sure.\n\nNow, back to turn 2 decision.\n\nIf I eat (1,2) at turn 2, I get +1, and can go to (3,5), get another +1.\n\nIf I don't eat (1,2), I might get (3,5) and (5,2), also +2.\n\nBut (1,2) might be easier to get now.\n\nAlso, the food at (1,2) is adjacent, so I can eat it immediately.\n\nMoreover, the tail reward danger: but here, tail is at (2,3), not adjacent to (1,2), so no danger.\n\nSo I think eating it is fine, and then move away from corner.\n\nSo for turn 2, move L to (1,2) to eat.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, as above, move U to (1,3), then R to (2,3), then U to (2,4), U to (2,5), R to (3,5) to eat at turn 7.\n\nThen for (5,2), I can try to go but may not make it, but I can survive.\n\nSince I need to output a sequence, but the state may change, so I only need to decide for turn 2 action, but the answer format is to output a sequence for multiple turns.\n\nLook at answer format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ... }\n\nFor at least 5 turns? \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but output sequence starting from t1.\n\nIn this case, t1=2, so output actions for turn 2,3,4,5,6,7 or more.\n\nBut the future depends on actions, so I need to plan a path.\n\nPerhaps for this state, I can plan to eat (1,2) and then go to (3,5).\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 2: L (eat at (1,2))\n\nThen turn 3: U (to (1,3))\n\nTurn 4: R (to (2,3))\n\nTurn 5: U (to (2,4))\n\nTurn 6: U (to (2,5))\n\nTurn 7: R (to (3,5) eat)\n\nThen turn 8: from (3,5), say move U to (3,6) or R to (4,5), but to avoid obstacle, move R to (4,5)\n\nBut (4,6) obstacle, so from (3,5) move R to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 9: move D to (4,4) etc.\n\nBut for the sequence, I can output up to turn 7 or more.\n\nSince the food at (5,2) can be eaten if I go directly, but as before, not in time, so ignore.\n\nAnother option: at turn 2, move R to (3,2), then go to (3,5) and (5,2).\n\nTurn 2: R to (3,2)\n\nTurn 3: U to (3,3)\n\nTurn 4: U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 5: U to (3,5) eat\n\nThen turn 6: R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 7: R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 8: D to (5,4)\n\nTurn 9: D to (5,3)\n\nTurn 10: D to (5,2) eat, but (5,2) gone after turn 11, so on turn 10 it is there, can eat.\n\n(5,2) life span 9 from turn 2, disappears after turn 11, so on turn 10, countdown=1, can be eaten.\n\nTurn 10: move to (5,2) and eat.\n\nFrom (5,3) on turn 9, move to (5,2) on turn 10.\n\nIn sequence:\n\nTurn 2: R to (3,2)\n\nTurn 3: U to (3,3)\n\nTurn 4: U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 5: U to (3,5) eat\n\nTurn 6: R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 7: R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 8: D to (5,4)\n\nTurn 9: D to (5,3)\n\nTurn 10: D to (5,2) eat\n\nThen I ate (3,5) and (5,2), missed (1,2).\n\nSame score.\n\nIf I eat (1,2) at turn 2, I can eat (3,5) but not (5,2) in time.\n\nSo either way, I get two food.\n\nBut by eating (1,2) first, I might be in a corner briefly, but I can escape.\n\nBy going right first, I stay central.\n\nFor long-term survival, staying central is better.\n\nAlso, there is an internal obstacle at (4,6), but not affecting much.\n\nSo perhaps moving right at turn 2 is better to avoid the corner.\n\nThen I can eat (3,5) and (5,2).\n\nFor the sequence, I need to output actions.\n\nSince the answer should be for multiple turns, let's plan the path to eat both.\n\nTurn 2: R to (3,2)  // no eat\n\nTurn 3: U to (3,3)  // no eat\n\nTurn 4: U to (3,4)  // no eat\n\nTurn 5: U to (3,5)  // eat\n\nTurn 6: R to (4,5)  // no eat, head (4,5), body (3,5), tail (3,4)\n\nTurn 7: R to (5,5)  // no eat, positions [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]? After move to (5,5): head (5,5), body (4,5), tail (3,5) but tail moves to previous body position.\n\nPositions before turn 7: [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4)] head at (4,5)\n\nMove R to (5,5): new head (5,5), body segment at (3,5) moves to prev head (4,5), so to (4,5), tail at (3,4) moves to prev body position (3,5)? Prev positions: pos0 (4,5) head, pos1 (3,5), pos2 (3,4)\n\nAfter move: new head (5,5), pos1 moves to prev pos0 (4,5), so to (4,5), pos2 moves to prev pos1 (3,5), so to (3,5). New positions [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nHead at (5,5), direction R.\n\nThen turn 8: move D to (5,4)  // no food, positions [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nTurn 9: move D to (5,3)  // no food, positions [(5,3), (5,4), (5,5)]\n\nTurn 10: move D to (5,2)  // eat food at (5,2), grow to length 4, positions [(5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)] head direction D.\n\nThen I have eaten two food.\n\nAnd I am at (5,2), can move U, D, L, R, but D to (5,1), L to (4,2), etc.\n\nFor the sequence, I can output up to turn 10 or so.\n\nBut the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", so for turn 2, plan at least to turn 7.\n\nSince I need to output for current turn, let's start with turn 2 action.\n\nI think moving R to (3,2) is safe and leads to eating two food.\n\nMoving L to (1,2) also works but corner risk.\n\nSo I'll go with R.\n\nThen actions:\n\nTurn 2: R\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: R (from (3,5) to (4,5))\n\nIn turn 5, I am at (3,5), then turn 6 to (4,5)\n\nBut in the sequence above, turn 6 is to (4,5), etc.\n\nFor the answer, I need to specify the action for each turn.\n\nAlso, for turn 2, action is R.\n\nThen for turn 3, from (3,2), move U to (3,3)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nTo be precise.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I evaluated the current state and planned a sequence of moves that allows the snake to eat both the food at (3,5) and (5,2), avoiding the risky corner position at (1,2) and ensuring the snake remains in open areas for better maneuverability. The food at (1,2) has a limited lifespan and is in a corner, making it less desirable due to potential trapping risks. By moving right immediately, the snake stays central and can efficiently reach (3,5) and (5,2) within their lifespans.\n\n- **Food Lifespan Tracking**:\n  - (1,2): Life span 8 at turn 2, disappears after turn 10 (countdown: turn 2=8, turn 9=1, gone turn 10).\n  - (3,5): Life span 8 at turn 2, disappears after turn 10 (countdown: turn 2=8, turn 9=1, gone turn 10).\n  - (5,2): Life span 9 at turn 2, disappears after turn 11 (countdown: turn 2=9, turn 10=1, gone turn 11).\n\nThe planned path:\n- Turn 2: Move right (R) to (3,2) – no food eaten, avoids immediate corner risk and positions the snake for vertical movement.\n- Turn 3: Move up (U) to (3,3) – no food, continues toward (3,5).\n- Turn 4: Move up (U) to (3,4) – no food, closer to (3,5).\n- Turn 5: Move up (U) to (3,5) – eat food (value +1), snake grows to length 3.\n- Turn 6: Move right (R) to (4,5) – no food, avoids internal obstacle at (4,6) and heads toward right side.\n- Turn 7: Move right (R) to (5,5) – no food, positions snake for descent to (5,2).\n- Turn 8: Move down (D) to (5,4) – no food, continues descent.\n- Turn 9: Move down (D) to (5,3) – no food, prepares for final move to (5,2).\n- Turn 10: Move down (D) to (5,2) – eat food (value +1), snake grows to length 4.\n\nThis sequence eats two positive foods for a score of +2 by turn 10. The food at (1,2) is intentionally skipped due to corner risk and lifespan constraints—reaching it would require detours that jeopardize eating (5,2) and limit long-term survival. After turn 10, the snake is at (5,2) with open moves (U, L, or R) to explore the grid safely.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: R\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: R\nTurn 7: R\nTurn 8: D\nTurn 9: D\nTurn 10: D\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 3, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (3,2), and the body is at (2,2). Since there are only two segments, the snake is length 2. Head direction is right, so it's moving to the east.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (1,2) with value 1 and life span 7. Since current turn is 3, it disappears after turn 3 + 7 = 10? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 3, life span is 7, meaning it will disappear after 7 more turns, so on turn 10? Let me clarify.\n\nThe life span is given as the remaining turns it exists. So for (1,2), life span 7 means it has 7 turns left including this one. So it will be there until turn 3 + 7 - 1 = 9? Standard countdown: if life span is N at turn t, it decreases each turn, so it disappears when countdown reaches 0. At turn t, life span is N, so after turn t, it has N-1 left, and so on, until turn t + N - 1 it has 1, and on turn t + N it disappears. But the food can be eaten on the turn when life span is still >0.\n\nFor example, at turn 3, life span 7, so it can be eaten from turn 3 to turn 9 (since on turn 10 it would be gone). Turn t + N - 1 is the last turn it can be eaten if N is the life span at turn t.\n\nSimilarly, for (3,5): value 1, life span 7, so from turn 3 to 9.\n\n(5,2): value 1, life span 8, so from turn 3 to 10.\n\nAll food is positive, value 1, so all good to eat.\n\nNow, snake head at (3,2), direction right. Possible moves: since direction is right, it can go right, up, or down, but not left because that would be reverse, which is not allowed. No instant reverse rule.\n\nCurrent head direction is R, so moving right. Next move can be R (continue right), U (up), or D (down), but not L (left) because that's opposite.\n\nNow, positions: head (3,2), body (2,2). So the tail is at (2,2).\n\nFood at (1,2), (3,5), (5,2).\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and prioritize survival.\n\nFirst, let's list possible actions for turn 3.\n\nFrom (3,2), with direction R:\n\n- Right (R) to (4,2)\n\n- Up (U) to (3,3)\n\n- Down (D) to (3,1)\n\nCannot go left to (2,2) because that's where the tail is, but since the tail will move, it might be okay, but let's see the rules.\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nBut in this case, if I go left to (2,2), which is the tail, and since the tail moves, after move, head goes to (2,2), and tail was at (2,2), but when head moves to tail position, since tail moves away, it should be fine, but let's simulate.\n\nAfter move, if head goes to (2,2), and the body was only one segment at (2,2), but positions: [(3,2), (2,2)] head moves to (2,2), then the body segment at (2,2) would move to... when snake moves, the head goes to new position, and each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n\nSo if head moves to new cell, and tail moves away from its position.\n\nSpecifically: if head moves to a cell, and that cell was occupied by tail, after movement, tail moves to the next position, so the cell is free except for the new head position.\n\nBut in terms of collision, if head moves to a cell that is not occupied by body except possibly tail, which moves away.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving to tail position is safe because tail moves.\n\nIn this case, (2,2) is the tail, so moving left to (2,2) should be safe.\n\nBut is it allowed? Movement constraints: \"No instant reverse\" – cannot move opposite to current direction.\n\nCurrent direction is R, moving left would be opposite, so it is not allowed. Cannot move left.\n\nSo possible moves: R, U, D.\n\nNow, let's check the grid.\n\nWalls: border x=0,7 y=0,7, so min x=1, max x=6; min y=1, max y=6.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), which is not near, since y=6 is top row? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6, so (4,6) is on the top row, y=6.\n\nBut our snake is at y=2, so not immediate issue.\n\nNow, food:\n\n- (1,2) at left, same row as snake.\n\n- (3,5) above, same x, y=5.\n\n- (5,2) to the right, same row.\n\nSince snake is at (3,2), and head moving right.\n\nIf I go right to (4,2), then I'm closer to (5,2) food.\n\nIf I go up to (3,3), or down to (3,1).\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, life spans: all have several turns left, so no urgency.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should aim to eat food, but avoid risks.\n\nNow, important: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills snake because head and new tail collide.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nSuppose tail has food on it. But food can be under body, but can only be eaten when head moves to it after body moves away.\n\nRule: \"Food can spawn under snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nAnd \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\nLet me parse this.\n\nFirst, if there is food under the tail, and the snake moves such that the tail moves away, exposing the food, then if head moves to that food, it eats it.\n\nBut the danger is when head is adjacent to tail, and tail has food, and you eat that food.\n\nFor example, suppose tail is at position with food, and head is next to tail. If you move such that tail moves away and head moves to that cell, you eat the food, but since you eat it, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move away; instead, a new tail segment is added.\n\nWhen you eat food, the snake grows, so the tail stays in place or something? No.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added, so the tail does not move that turn. Thus, the new segment is at the position where the head was before, but since head moved to food, and tail didn't move, the snake grows.\n\nBut in terms of positions: suppose head is at H, tail at T, and food at F which is under T.\n\nFirst, body moves away: when snake moves, if tail moves away from T, then food at T is exposed.\n\nThen if head moves to T, it eats the food.\n\nBut when you eat, the snake grows, so after eating, the head is at T, and a new segment is added where? Typically, the tail does not move when eating, so the new segment is added to the end.\n\nSequence:\n\n- Before move: head at H, tail at T, food at F (which is T).\n\n- Move: head moves to a new position. If head moves to T, but T is occupied by tail, but since tail will move, it's allowed.\n\nAfter move: head moves to new cell, say N.\n\nIf N has food, then snake grows: the tail does not move, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position? No.\n\nStandard: when snake moves, all segments shift: head to new position, each body segment to previous position of the segment ahead.\n\nIf the head moves to a cell with food, then after moving the segments, a new segment is added at the tail position, meaning the tail doesn't move; it stays, and a new segment is added there, so the tail extends.\n\nIn terms of positions:\n\n- Start: positions [H, B1, B2, ..., T] with food at F.\n\n- Head moves to new cell N.\n\n- If N is not food, then all segments move: head to N, B1 to H, B2 to B1, ..., T to previous position of the segment before it.\n\n- If N has food, then after moving to N, a new segment is added at the end, so the tail position remains, and the new segment is at the old tail position? Let's think.\n\nBetter to think: after the move, if food was eaten, the snake length increases by one, so the tail does not advance; it stays in place, and a new segment is created there. But in terms of the list, the last position is duplicated or something.\n\nExample: snake positions [H, T] for length 2.\n\nHead moves to new cell N.\n\nIf no food, new positions: [N, H] so tail was T, now it's at H, and H is where head was.\n\nIf head moves to a cell with food, then after moving to N, the snake grows, so positions become [N, H, T]? No, that would be adding at the head.\n\nStandard: when moving and eating, the head moves to the food cell, and the body follows, but since eating, the tail doesn't move, so the new segment is added where the tail was, but tail was at T, and it doesn't move, so positions become [N, H] with T still there? I'm confusing myself.\n\nI think I need to clarify the growth mechanism.\n\nFrom the rules: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food.\n\nAnd in movement, when eating, the tail does not move; a new segment is added at the tail position.\n\nSo for a snake of length L:\n\n- Normal move (no eat): positions shift, head to new, each body segment to previous position, tail leaves its cell.\n\n- Eat move: head moves to new cell with food, body segments move as usual, but tail does not move; instead, it stays, and a new segment is added there, so the tail cell remains occupied, and the snake grows.\n\nIn the case where head moves to tail position:\n\nSuppose positions [H, T], head at H, tail at T, and T has food.\n\nIf head moves to T, since moving to tail is allowed, and T has food.\n\nAfter move: head moves to T, and since it eats food, the tail does not move, so the new positions are [T, H] but with growth, so it should be [T, H, T] or something? No.\n\nPositions: before move: head H, tail T, with food at T.\n\nHead moves to T (new head position).\n\nSince it moves to food, eating occurs.\n\nThe body segment: since only one body segment, it moves to the previous head position H.\n\nBut because of eating, the tail does not move, so the new positions are: head at T, and the body at H, and since eating, a new segment is added at the previous tail position, which was T, but T is now the head, so it's messy.\n\nI think there's a contradiction.\n\nPerhaps when head moves to tail position, and tail has food, it's problematic.\n\nThe \"Tail Reward Danger\" specifically addresses this.\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nSo, in the scenario where head is next to tail, and tail cell has food, if you move head to the tail cell to eat the food, then after eating, the head is at the former tail position, and because of growth, the new tail is added at the old tail position, but since head is there, it collides with itself.\n\nLet's simulate with positions.\n\nSuppose snake: head at (3,2), tail at (2,2), and food at (2,2).\n\nBut in this state, food is not at tail, tail is at (2,2), but food is at (1,2), (3,5), (5,2), not at (2,2).\n\nSo no food under tail now.\n\nBut for future reference.\n\nIn this case, for turn 3, no immediate danger.\n\nBack to moves.\n\nPossible actions turn 3: from (3,2) direction R, can go R to (4,2), U to (3,3), D to (3,1).\n\nNow, let's evaluate each.\n\nFirst, go right to (4,2).\n\nThen new head position (4,2), new direction R if we choose R.\n\nBody moves: the body segment was at (2,2), but since head moved, the body moves to previous head position (3,2). So new positions: head (4,2), body (3,2). Tail is now (3,2).\n\nSnake is [(4,2), (3,2)].\n\nDirection is now R.\n\nFood: (5,2) is at (5,2), which is east of (4,2), so if I go right again, I can eat it on turn 4.\n\nBut let's think ahead.\n\nIf I go right to (4,2) on turn 3.\n\nThen on turn 4, from (4,2), direction R, I can go R to (5,2), which has food.\n\nIf I go to (5,2), I eat the food, value +1, length increases.\n\nAfter eating: head moves to (5,2), which has food, so snake grows.\n\nPrevious positions: head was (4,2), body (3,2).\n\nHead moves to (5,2), body moves to (4,2), and since eating, tail does not move, so new segment added at tail position? Tail was at (3,2), and it doesn't move, so positions become head (5,2), body (4,2), and new segment at (3,2)? But the body was already moving to (4,2), so the segments are: head at (5,2), then the first body segment at (4,2), and since eating, a new segment is added at the end, which was (3,2), so now snake is [(5,2), (4,2), (3,2)].\n\nYes, length 3.\n\nAnd the food at (5,2) is eaten, so removed.\n\nNow, life span was 8 at turn 3, so at turn 4 it would be 7, but eaten, so gone.\n\nNow, after that, on turn 5, head at (5,2), direction R (since last move was right).\n\nPossible moves: R to (6,2), U to (5,3), D to (5,1).\n\nBut (6,2) is x=6, which is not wall, x=7 is wall, so x=6 is okay, since border walls at x=0 and x=7, so x from 1 to 6, so (6,2) is safe.\n\nU to (5,3), D to (5,1) also safe.\n\nBut no food immediately nearby except (1,2) and (3,5), but (1,2) is far left.\n\n(3,5) is at y=5, x=3.\n\nNow, if I go to (4,2) on turn 3, then to (5,2) on turn 4, eat food, then on turn 5, I can go different ways.\n\nBut let's consider other options for turn 3.\n\nIf I go up to (3,3) on turn 3.\n\nNew head (3,3), body at (3,2) since it moves to previous head position.\n\nNew positions: [(3,3), (3,2)]\n\nDirection now U (up), since we moved up.\n\nFood: (3,5) is at (3,5), which is north, same x, y=5.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can go up to (3,4), then to (3,5) to eat.\n\nBut (3,5) has life span 7 at turn 3, so at turn 4, if I go to (3,4), life span decreases to 6, then turn 5 to (3,5) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down to (3,1) on turn 3, then I'm away from food, but (5,2) is east, (1,2) west, (3,5) north.\n\n(3,1) is south, no food there.\n\nSo going down might not be good for eating soon.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nAlso, avoid risks like getting trapped.\n\nNow, another thing: the internal obstacle at (4,6), but y=6 is top, since y=0 bottom, y=7 top wall, so y=6 is row below top wall.\n\nBut snake at y=2, so far.\n\nNow, let's list all food and their positions.\n\nGrid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except walls.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), so cell (4,6) is blocked.\n\nFood at (1,2), (3,5), (5,2).\n\nLife spans: (1,2) life 7, disappears after turn 9 (since turn 3 + 7 -1 =9? At turn t, life span N, it exists until turn t + N -1.\n\nTurn 3: life span 7, so after turn 3, it has 6 left, so can be eaten until turn 3+6=9? Let's define.\n\nAt the start of turn t, food has life span L, it can be eaten during turn t if head moves to it.\n\nAfter turn t, life span decreases by 1, so at start of turn t+1, life span L-1.\n\nIt disappears when life span reaches 0, so cannot be eaten on turn when life span becomes 0.\n\nFor (1,2): life span 7 at turn 3, so:\n\n- Turn 3: can be eaten, life span 7\n\n- Turn 4: life span 6\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn 9: life span 1\n\n- Turn 10: life span 0, gone\n\nSimilarly, (3,5): life span 7, same, until turn 9.\n\n(5,2): life span 8, so until turn 10 (since turn 3+7=10 for last eat? Life span 8 at turn 3, so turn 3: L=8, turn 4: L=7, ..., turn 10: L=1, turn 11: L=0 gone. So can be eaten until turn 10.\n\nNow, back to actions.\n\nI need to plan multiple turns.\n\nSince all food is positive, I should eat them, but need to do it safely.\n\nAlso, the snake is short, length 2, so eating food grows it, which might increase risk, but also allows more eating.\n\nPrioritize survival.\n\nNow, let's consider going for (5,2) first, since it's close.\n\nOption 1: Turn 3: R to (4,2)\n\nThen turn 4: from (4,2) dir R, can go R to (5,2) to eat.\n\nAfter eating, positions: head (5,2), body (4,2), and new segment at (3,2)? Earlier I said: after move to (5,2) and eat, positions become [(5,2), (4,2), (3,2)] with length 3.\n\nDirection after move is R.\n\nThen on turn 5, head at (5,2) dir R.\n\nCan go R to (6,2), U to (5,3), D to (5,1).\n\n(6,2) is safe, x=6<7.\n\nFrom there, I can go to other food.\n\n(1,2) is at (1,2), which is west, but snake body is at (4,2) and (3,2), so (3,2) is occupied.\n\n(3,5) is at (3,5), north.\n\nSo from (5,2), I can go up to (5,3), then (5,4), etc. to (3,5), but (3,5) is x=3, so I need to go left.\n\nBut body is at (4,2) and (3,2), so if I go left from (5,2), to (4,2), but (4,2) is occupied by body, so collision.\n\nOn turn 5, positions: head (5,2), body segments at (4,2) and (3,2).\n\nIf I move left to (4,2), which is occupied by body, so head touches body, collision, death.\n\nCannot go left to (4,2).\n\nSimilarly, down to (5,1) is safe, but no food.\n\nUp to (5,3) safe.\n\nRight to (6,2) safe.\n\nSo from (5,2), possible moves: R, U, D, not L.\n\nIf I go R to (6,2), then head at (6,2), body moves to (5,2), (4,2)? Positions: before move turn 5: [(5,2), (4,2), (3,2)]\n\nHead moves to (6,2), body moves: segment at (4,2) moves to (5,2), segment at (3,2) moves to (4,2), so new positions [(6,2), (5,2), (4,2)]\n\nTail at (4,2).\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen turn 6, from (6,2), can go R? x=6, right would be x=7, which is wall, so cannot go right.\n\nCan go U to (6,3), D to (6,1), or L to (5,2) but (5,2) is occupied by body, so cannot go left, collision.\n\n(5,2) is the first body segment, so occupied.\n\nSo from (6,2), possible moves: U to (6,3), D to (6,1), not R (wall), not L (body).\n\nSo I can go up or down.\n\nIf up to (6,3), then I can continue north.\n\nBut food at (3,5) and (1,2) are elsewhere.\n\n(1,2) at (1,2), which is far left, and (3,5) at (3,5).\n\nFrom (6,3), I might need to go left and up to (3,5).\n\nBut the body is behind, at (5,2) and (4,2), so as I move, it follows.\n\nFor example, if I go to (6,3), then to (6,4), etc., but (3,5) is at y=5, x=3.\n\nTo reach (3,5) from (6,2), I need to go left to x=3 and up to y=5.\n\nBut when I move left from (6,2), I can't because body is at (5,2), blocked.\n\nSo from (6,2), I can only go up or down, say to (6,3).\n\nThen positions [(6,3), (6,2), (5,2)]? After move to (6,3), body: (5,2) moves to (6,2), (4,2) moves to (5,2), so [(6,3), (6,2), (5,2)]\n\nHead at (6,3), body at (6,2) and (5,2).\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen turn 7, from (6,3), can go U to (6,4), D to (6,2) but (6,2) is body, cannot, L to (5,3), R wall, so only U or L.\n\nIf U to (6,4), then similar.\n\nOr L to (5,3).\n\nThen to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut to get to (3,5), I need to go to (3, something).\n\nFrom (6,3), go L to (5,3), then L to (4,3), then L to (3,3), then U to (3,4), then U to (3,5) to eat.\n\nBut at turn 5, we are at (6,2), turn 6 to (6,3), turn 7 to (5,3), turn 8 to (4,3), turn 9 to (3,3), turn 10 to (3,4), turn 11 to (3,5).\n\nBut (3,5) has life span decreasing: at turn 3, L=7, so turn 4:6, turn5:5, turn6:4, turn7:3, turn8:2, turn9:1, turn10:0, so on turn 10, life span 0, gone, cannot eat on turn 10.\n\nLife span at turn 3 is 7, so on turn 10, life span would be 7 - (10-3) = 7-7=0, so not available on turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, turn 9: 7 - (9-3) = 7-6=1, so can be eaten on turn 9.\n\nBut in the path, to eat at (3,5) on turn 9, I need to be at (3,5) on turn 9.\n\nFrom above, on turn 9, I am at (3,3) if I go that path, not at (3,5).\n\nFrom turn 5: head at (5,2)\n\nTurn 6: to (6,3)  -- but from (5,2) to (6,3) is diagonal? No, moves are U/D/L/R, so from (5,2) I can go U to (5,3), not to (6,3) directly.\n\nI think I messed up.\n\nAt turn 5: head at (5,2) after eating on turn 4.\n\nFrom (5,2), I can go U to (5,3), for example.\n\nLet's start from turn 3 option.\n\nIf turn 3: R to (4,2)\n\nTurn 4: R to (5,2) eat food. Now positions [(5,2), (4,2), (3,2)] dir R\n\nTurn 5: from (5,2) dir R, can go U to (5,3), D to (5,1), or R to (6,2), not L.\n\nSuppose I go U to (5,3) to head north.\n\nNew positions: head (5,3), body (5,2) and (4,2)? After move: head to (5,3), body segments move: the first body segment (at (4,2)) moves to (5,2), the second body segment (at (3,2)) moves to (4,2), so positions [(5,3), (5,2), (4,2)]\n\nTail at (4,2).\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 6: from (5,3) dir U, can go U to (5,4), D to (5,2) but (5,2) is body, cannot, L to (4,3), R to (6,3).\n\nSo U, L, R possible.\n\n(6,3) is safe.\n\nNow, to reach (3,5), I can go left and up.\n\nFor example, turn 6: L to (4,3)\n\nThen positions: head to (4,3), body to (5,3) and (5,2)? Before move: [(5,3), (5,2), (4,2)]\n\nHead moves to (4,3), body: (5,2) moves to (5,3), (4,2) moves to (5,2), so new positions [(4,3), (5,3), (5,2)]\n\nTail at (5,2).\n\nDirection L (left).\n\nTurn 7: from (4,3) dir L, can go L to (3,3), U to (4,4), D to (4,2), but (4,2) might be free, let's see positions: body at (5,3) and (5,2), so (4,2) is free, since tail moved from (4,2) to (5,2) on previous move.\n\nPositions: [(4,3), (5,3), (5,2)], so cells occupied: (4,3), (5,3), (5,2). So (4,2) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3) free, (4,4) free.\n\nSo from (4,3), can go L to (3,3), U to (4,4), D to (4,2), not R to (5,3) body.\n\nSo L, U, D.\n\nGo L to (3,3)\n\nPositions: head to (3,3), body to (4,3) and (5,3)? Before: [(4,3), (5,3), (5,2)]\n\nHead to (3,3), body: (5,3) moves to (4,3), (5,2) moves to (5,3), so [(3,3), (4,3), (5,3)]\n\nTail at (5,3).\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 8: from (3,3) dir L, can go L to (2,3), U to (3,4), D to (3,2), R to (4,3) body, so not R.\n\n(3,2) is free? Positions: (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), so (3,2) free, (2,3) free, (3,4) free.\n\nSo L, U, D possible.\n\nGo U to (3,4) towards (3,5)\n\nPositions: head to (3,4), body to (3,3) and (4,3)? Before: [(3,3), (4,3), (5,3)]\n\nHead to (3,4), body: (4,3) moves to (3,3), (5,3) moves to (4,3), so [(3,4), (3,3), (4,3)]\n\nTail at (4,3).\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 9: from (3,4) dir U, can go U to (3,5) which has food, D to (3,3) body, L to (2,4), R to (4,4).\n\n(3,5) has food, life span: at turn 3 L=7, turn 9 is 9-3=6 turns later? Turn 3 L=7, turn 4 L=6, ..., turn 9 L=7-6=1, so available.\n\nGo U to (3,5) eat food.\n\nAfter eating, head to (3,5), body moves: (3,3) moves to (3,4)? Positions before move: [(3,4), (3,3), (4,3)]\n\nHead moves to (3,5), which has food, so eat, grow.\n\nBody: the first body segment at (3,3) moves to (3,4), the second at (4,3) moves to (3,3), and since eating, tail does not move, so new segment added at the previous tail position, which was (4,3), but (4,3) is now occupied by the moving body? Let's see:\n\nAfter moving the body: when head moves to (3,5), the body segments shift: segment that was at (3,3) moves to the previous head position (3,4), segment that was at (4,3) moves to the previous position of the segment before it, which was (3,3), so now positions: head at (3,5), then body at (3,4), and body at (3,3).\n\nBut since eating, a new segment is added at the end, at the previous tail position. Previous tail position was (4,3), but now it's empty? After shifting, the positions are head (3,5), body (3,4), body (3,3), and the tail was at (4,3), which moved to (3,3), so the new segment is added at (3,3)? But (3,3) is already occupied.\n\nI think I have a confusion in growth.\n\nStandard: when eating, the head moves to the food cell, the body segments move as usual to the previous positions, but the tail does not advance; it stays, and a new segment is added there, so the position that was tail remains occupied.\n\nIn this case:\n\nBefore move turn 9: positions [(3,4), (3,3), (4,3)] so head (3,4), body segments: (3,3) and (4,3), with (4,3) being the tail.\n\nHead moves to (3,5).\n\nBody segments move: the segment at (3,3) moves to (3,4) (previous head position), the segment at (4,3) moves to (3,3) (previous position of the segment ahead).\n\nSo after movement but before growth: head at (3,5), body at (3,4), body at (3,3).\n\nThen, since food eaten, a new segment is added at the previous tail position, which was (4,3) before the move. But after the move, the tail has moved to (3,3), so the previous tail position is (4,3), which is now empty, so new segment added at (4,3).\n\nThus new positions: [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3)]\n\nLength 4.\n\nAnd food at (3,5) eaten.\n\nThen on turn 10, head at (3,5) dir U.\n\nCan go U to (3,6), but y=6, and there is an internal obstacle at (4,6), but (3,6) is not obstacle, but y=6 is below y=7 wall, so (3,6) is valid, no wall.\n\nWalls at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is okay.\n\nBut internal obstacle at (4,6), so (3,6) is free.\n\nFrom (3,5), can go U to (3,6), D to (3,4) body, L to (2,5), R to (4,5).\n\n(3,4) is body, so cannot go down.\n\nGo U, L, or R.\n\nIf U to (3,6), then positions etc.\n\nBut we also have food at (1,2) with life span until turn 9, so on turn 10 it's gone.\n\nLife span at turn 3:7, so turn 9 L=1, turn 10 L=0 gone.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) was eaten earlier.\n\nIn this path, we ate two foods.\n\nBut let's see the other option for turn 3.\n\nIf on turn 3 I go up instead.\n\nTurn 3: U to (3,3)\n\nThen positions: head (3,3), body (3,2)\n\nDirection U.\n\nFood at (3,5) above.\n\nTurn 4: from (3,3) dir U, can go U to (3,4), L to (2,3), R to (4,3), D to (3,2) body, cannot.\n\nSo U, L, R.\n\nGo U to (3,4) towards food.\n\nPositions: head (3,4), body (3,3)\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 5: from (3,4) dir U, can go U to (3,5) eat food, D to (3,3) body, L to (2,4), R to (4,4).\n\n(3,5) has food, life span at turn 5: was 7 at turn 3, so turn 5 L=5, available.\n\nGo U to (3,5) eat.\n\nAfter eating: head to (3,5), body moves to (3,4), and since eating, new segment added at previous tail position, which was (3,2)? Before move: positions [(3,4), (3,3)] with tail at (3,3)? Snake positions: before turn 5, head at (3,4), body at (3,3), so tail at (3,3).\n\nHead moves to (3,5), body segment at (3,3) moves to (3,4), and since eating, new segment added at previous tail position (3,3), so positions: head (3,5), body (3,4), and body (3,3). So [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3)]\n\nLength 3.\n\nDirection U.\n\nNow, turn 6: head at (3,5) dir U, can go U to (3,6), L to (2,5), R to (4,5), not D to (3,4) body.\n\n(3,6) is free, as before.\n\nBut food at (1,2) and (5,2) available.\n\n(5,2) at (5,2), life span 8 at turn 3, so turn 6 L=5, available.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can go right to (4,5), then down to (4,4), etc. to (5,2).\n\nBut (5,2) is at y=2, so need to go down.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) at (1,2), left.\n\nBut body at (3,4) and (3,3), so if I go down from (3,5), cannot, body at (3,4).\n\nSo must go U, L, or R.\n\nIf go R to (4,5), then positions: head to (4,5), body to (3,5) and (3,4)? Before: [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3)]\n\nHead to (4,5), body: (3,4) moves to (3,5), (3,3) moves to (3,4), so [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nTail at (3,4).\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 7: from (4,5) dir R, can go R to (5,5), U to (4,6), D to (4,4), L to (3,5) body.\n\n(4,6) has internal obstacle? Internal obstacle at (4,6), so cannot go to (4,6).\n\nWalls: internal obstacle at (4,6), so (4,6) is blocked.\n\nSo from (4,5), can go R to (5,5), D to (4,4), not U (obstacle), not L (body).\n\n(5,5) is free, (4,4) free.\n\nGo R to (5,5), for example.\n\nThen to (5,4), (5,3), down to (5,2) to eat.\n\nTurn 7: to (5,5)\n\nPositions: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 8: from (5,5) dir R, can go R to (6,5), U to (5,6), D to (5,4), L to (4,5) body.\n\n(5,6) y=6, free except obstacle at (4,6), so (5,6) okay.\n\nGo D to (5,4) towards (5,2).\n\nPositions: head to (5,4), body to (5,5) and (4,5)? Before: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nHead to (5,4), body: (4,5) moves to (5,5), (3,5) moves to (4,5), so [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nTail at (4,5).\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 9: from (5,4) dir D, can go D to (5,3), U to (5,5) body, L to (4,4), R to (6,4).\n\nGo D to (5,3)\n\nPositions: head to (5,3), body to (5,4) and (5,5)? Before: [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nHead to (5,3), body: (5,5) moves to (5,4), (4,5) moves to (5,5), so [(5,3), (5,4), (5,5)]\n\nTail at (5,5).\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 10: from (5,3) dir D, can go D to (5,2) eat food, U to (5,4) body, L to (4,3), R to (6,3).\n\n(5,2) has food, life span: at turn 3 L=8, turn 10 L=8-7=1? Turn 3 L=8, turn 4 L=7, ..., turn 10 L=8-7=1, yes available.\n\nGo D to (5,2) eat.\n\nThen positions grow to length 4 or something.\n\nBut we have (1,2) food with life span until turn 9, so on turn 10 it's gone, so we missed it.\n\nIn this path, we ate (3,5) on turn 5 and (5,2) on turn 10, but (1,2) expired.\n\nNow, back to turn 3, if I go down to (3,1), then I'm at (3,1), away from food, and need to come back, might miss some food.\n\nFor example, to eat (5,2), I need to go east, but from (3,1), I can go to (4,1), etc., but (5,2) might be eaten later, but (1,2) is closer but west.\n\n(1,2) at (1,2), from (3,1) I can go west to (2,1), then to (1,1), then to (1,2), but (1,2) life until turn 9.\n\nTurn 3: D to (3,1)\n\nPositions: head (3,1), body (3,2)\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 4: from (3,1) dir D, can go D to (3,0) but y=0 wall, cannot; U to (3,2) body, cannot; L to (2,1), R to (4,1).\n\nSo only L or R.\n\nSay go L to (2,1)\n\nThen to (1,1), then to (1,2) eat on turn 6 or something.\n\nBut let's not detail, it might be slower.\n\nTo maximize score, eating (5,2) on turn 4 is fast, and (3,5) on turn 9, but (1,2) might be missed.\n\n(1,2) at (1,2), life until turn 9.\n\nIn the first path where I went to (4,2) then (5,2) eat on turn 4, then to (3,5) eat on turn 9, I can also eat (1,2) if possible.\n\nIn that path, after eating (3,5) on turn 9, head at (3,5), but (1,2) is at (1,2), and on turn 10 it's gone, so I cannot eat it.\n\nSimilarly, if I go for (1,2) first.\n\nTurn 3: from (3,2) dir R, I can go left? But cannot, because no reverse, direction R, cannot go L.\n\nSo I cannot go directly to (1,2) because I have to go U or D first to change direction.\n\nFor example, turn 3: U to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 4: L to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 5: L to (1,3)\n\nThen turn 6: D to (1,2) eat.\n\nBut (1,2) life span at turn 6: L=7-3=4, available.\n\nEat on turn 6.\n\nThen similarly, I can go to other food.\n\nBut (5,2) might be eaten by then, but I control the snake.\n\nAfter eating (1,2) on turn 6, positions: let's not compute all.\n\nThe point is, I need to see which sequence allows eating all three foods.\n\nBut (3,5) and (1,2) both have life span 7, until turn 9, and (5,2) until turn 10.\n\nTo eat all, I need to eat (1,2) and (3,5) by turn 9, and (5,2) by turn 10.\n\nWith snake starting at (3,2), short.\n\nIf I go for (5,2) first, eat on turn 4, then to (3,5) eat on turn 9 as in first path, but (1,2) is at (1,2), and from (3,5) on turn 9, it's far, and I have a long snake, hard to reach (1,2) quickly.\n\nFor example, on turn 9 after eating (3,5), head at (3,5), body around, to go to (1,2) I need to go left and down, but with body, it might be tight, and on turn 10 (1,2) gone.\n\nSimilarly, if I go for (1,2) first, I can eat it around turn 6, then to (3,5) by turn 8 or 9, then to (5,2) by turn 10.\n\nLet's estimate.\n\nTurn 3: U to (3,3)\n\nTurn 4: L to (2,3)\n\nTurn 5: L to (1,3)\n\nTurn 6: D to (1,2) eat. (since (1,2) at y=2, from (1,3) go down to (1,2) eat.\n\nAfter eat, positions: before turn 6, head at (1,3), body at (2,3)? Positions after turn 5: if turn 5 to (1,3), from (2,3), so positions [(1,3), (2,3)]? Turn 4: after U to (3,3) on turn 3, turn 4 L to (2,3), positions [(2,3), (3,3)]\n\nTurn 5 L to (1,3), positions [(1,3), (2,3)]\n\nTurn 6 D to (1,2) eat. Head to (1,2), body segment at (2,3) moves to (1,3), and since eat, new segment at previous tail position (2,3)? Before move: positions [(1,3), (2,3)] tail at (2,3).\n\nHead to (1,2), body to (1,3), new segment at (2,3), so positions [(1,2), (1,3), (2,3)] length 3.\n\nDirection D.\n\nNow, to go to (3,5), which is at (3,5).\n\nFrom (1,2), I need to go east and north.\n\nTurn 7: from (1,2) dir D, can go D to (1,1), U to (1,3) body, L to (0,2) wall, R to (2,2).\n\n(1,3) is body, so cannot U; L wall; so only D or R.\n\nGo R to (2,2)\n\nPositions: head to (2,2), body to (1,2) and (1,3)? Before: [(1,2), (1,3), (2,3)]\n\nHead to (2,2), body: (1,3) moves to (1,2), (2,3) moves to (1,3), so [(2,2), (1,2), (1,3)]\n\nTail at (1,3).\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 8: from (2,2) dir R, can go R to (3,2), U to (2,3), D to (2,1), L to (1,2) body.\n\n(2,3) is free? Positions: (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), so (2,3) free, (3,2) free, (2,1) free.\n\nSo go R to (3,2)\n\nPositions: head to (3,2), body to (2,2) and (1,2)? Before: [(2,2), (1,2), (1,3)]\n\nHead to (3,2), body: (1,2) moves to (2,2), (1,3) moves to (1,2), so [(3,2), (2,2), (1,2)]\n\nTail at (1,2).\n\nDirection R.\n\nNow (3,5) is at (3,5), so need to go up.\n\nTurn 9: from (3,2) dir R, can go U to (3,3), D to (3,1), R to (4,2), not L.\n\nGo U to (3,3)\n\nPositions: head to (3,3), body to (3,2) and (2,2)? Before: [(3,2), (2,2), (1,2)]\n\nHead to (3,3), body: (2,2) moves to (3,2), (1,2) moves to (2,2), so [(3,3), (3,2), (2,2)]\n\nTail at (2,2).\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 10: from (3,3) dir U, can go U to (3,4), D to (3,2) body, L to (2,3), R to (4,3).\n\n(3,2) is body, so not D.\n\nGo U to (3,4)\n\nBut (3,5) is at (3,5), and life span: on turn 9 it was L=1, turn 10 L=0 gone, so cannot eat on turn 10. On turn 9, I was at (3,2), not at (3,5), so I missed (3,5).\n\nTo eat (3,5) I need to be there by turn 9.\n\nIn this sequence, on turn 9 I am at (3,2), not close.\n\nFrom turn 6 after eating (1,2), I could go directly north and east, but from (1,2) it's hard to reach (3,5) quickly with the body.\n\nFor example, turn 7 from (1,2) go U to (1,3) but (1,3) is body? On turn 6 after eating, positions [(1,2), (1,3), (2,3)], so (1,3) occupied.\n\nFrom (1,2), I can go R to (2,2) as I did, or D to (1,1).\n\nBut to go up, I need to go to (2,2) then (2,3) etc.\n\nBut (2,3) was tail, but moved.\n\nFrom (1,2) turn 7 go R to (2,2), then turn 8 go U to (2,3), then turn 9 go U to (2,4), not to (3,5).\n\nTo reach (3,5) by turn 9, from turn 6 at (1,2), it takes at least 3 moves: to (2,2), (3,2), then (3,3), not (3,5).\n\n(3,5) requires moving up 3 from y=2 to y=5, so at least 3 moves north, but from x=1 to x=3, so minimum 3 moves, but with body, it might take more if not direct.\n\nFrom (1,2) on turn 7, go R to (2,2) turn 7, then turn 8 go R to (3,2), then turn 9 go U to (3,3), but (3,3) not (3,5), so on turn 9 at (3,3), (3,5) is at y=5, I need to go up twice more, but on turn 10 it's gone.\n\nSo I can't reach (3,5) in time if I eat (1,2) first.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat (3,5) first, I can eat it by turn 5, as in second option, then to (1,2) by turn 9 might be tight.\n\nTurn 3 U to (3,3), turn 4 U to (3,4), turn 5 U to (3,5) eat.\n\nThen on turn 5 head at (3,5) with body (3,4) and (3,3).\n\nThen to (1,2): turn 6 L to (2,5), turn 7 L to (1,5), turn 8 D to (1,4), turn 9 D to (1,3), turn 10 D to (1,2) but (1,2) gone on turn 10.\n\nLife span of (1,2) until turn 9, so on turn 10 gone.\n\nOn turn 9, I am at (1,3) or (1,4), not (1,2), so miss it.\n\nSo it seems difficult to eat all three within the time, since (1,2) and (3,5) both expire on turn 9, and they are at opposite corners.\n\n(1,2) and (3,5) are 4 units apart in Manhattan distance, with snake short, but with growth, it takes time.\n\nThe only way to eat both might be to go directly from one to the other, but with the body, it's hard in 6 turns from turn 3 to 9.\n\nFrom turn 3 to turn 9, 6 moves.\n\nFrom (3,2) to (1,2) is 2 left, but I can't go left directly, so need to detour, takes 2 or 3 moves to (1,2), then to (3,5) from (1,2) to (3,5) is 2 right and 3 up, 5 moves, total 7 or 8 moves, not enough in 6 turns.\n\nSimilarly, to (3,5) first, 2 up to (3,4) or something, then to (1,2) similar.\n\nSo likely, I can eat only two of the three foods.\n\nNow, (5,2) has longer life, until turn 10, so I can eat it later.\n\nTo maximize score, eating two foods is possible, eating all three might not be.\n\nBut in the first path, I ate (5,2) and (3,5), both by turn 9.\n\n(5,2) eaten on turn 4, (3,5) on turn 9.\n\nAnd (1,2) missed.\n\nSimilarly, I could eat (1,2) and (3,5), but (5,2) can be eaten later.\n\nFor example, if I eat (1,2) and (3,5) by turn 9, then (5,2) by turn 10.\n\nBut as above, eating (1,2) and (3,5) both by turn 9 is tight.\n\nSuppose turn 3: U to (3,3)\n\nTurn 4: U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 5: U to (3,5) eat. Positions [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3)]\n\nThen immediately go west and down to (1,2).\n\nTurn 6: from (3,5) dir U, go L to (2,5)\n\nPositions: head to (2,5), body to (3,5) and (3,4)? Before: [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3)]\n\nHead to (2,5), body: (3,4) moves to (3,5), (3,3) moves to (3,4), so [(2,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nTail at (3,4).\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 7: from (2,5) dir L, go L to (1,5)\n\nPositions: head to (1,5), body to (2,5) and (3,5)? Before: [(2,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nHead to (1,5), body: (3,5) moves to (2,5), (3,4) moves to (3,5), so [(1,5), (2,5), (3,5)]\n\nTail at (3,5).\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 8: from (1,5) dir L, can go L wall, U to (1,6), D to (1,4), R to (2,5) body.\n\nL to x=0 wall, cannot; U to (1,6) y=6, free; D to (1,4); R to (2,5) body, cannot.\n\nSo U or D.\n\nGo D to (1,4)\n\nPositions: head to (1,4), body to (1,5) and (2,5)? Before: [(1,5), (2,5), (3,5)]\n\nHead to (1,4), body: (2,5) moves to (1,5), (3,5) moves to (2,5), so [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5)]\n\nTail at (2,5).\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 9: from (1,4) dir D, go D to (1,3)\n\nPositions: head to (1,3), body to (1,4) and (1,5)? Before: [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5)]\n\nHead to (1,3), body: (1,5) moves to (1,4), (2,5) moves to (1,5), so [(1,3), (1,4), (1,5)]\n\nTail at (1,5).\n\nDirection D.\n\nNow (1,2) is at (1,2), so from (1,3) I can go D to (1,2) on turn 10, but on turn 10, (1,2) life span 0, gone, so cannot eat.\n\nOn turn 9, I am at (1,3), not (1,2), so I can go to (1,2) on turn 10 but it's gone.\n\nSo I miss (1,2).\n\nThus, it's impossible to eat both (1,2) and (3,5) with the given turns.\n\nTherefore, the best is to eat (5,2) and (3,5), as in the first plan.\n\nNow, back to turn 3, if I go down, it might be worse.\n\nSo for turn 3, going right to (4,2) seems good to target (5,2).\n\nThen turn 4 eat (5,2).\n\nThen from there, go towards (3,5) as before.\n\nIn the first path, I went to (3,5) via the left, but I could go directly.\n\nAfter eating (5,2) on turn 4, head at (5,2), I can go up immediately.\n\nTurn 5: U to (5,3)\n\nThen turn 6: U to (5,4)\n\nTurn 7: U to (5,5)\n\nThen to go to (3,5), I need to go left.\n\nTurn 8: L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 9: L to (3,5) eat.\n\nLife span of (3,5) on turn 9 is 1, available.\n\nEat.\n\nSimilarly, I can reach it.\n\nIn this case, on turn 9 I eat (3,5).\n\nAnd (1,2) missed, but that's fine.\n\nNow, for turn 3, action should be R to (4,2).\n\nThen turn 4: R to (5,2) eat.\n\nThen turn 5: from (5,2) dir R, but after moving to (5,2) and eating, direction is R, so from (5,2) dir R, go U to (5,3)\n\nThen turn 6: U to (5,4)  (assuming no issue)\n\nTurn 7: U to (5,5)\n\nTurn 8: L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 9: L to (3,5) eat.\n\nBut on turn 8, from (5,5) to (4,5), then turn 9 to (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is at (3,5), so from (4,5) to (3,5) is left.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but I need to output actions starting from turn 3.\n\nAlso, for the answer, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, but output only the necessary actions, probably a few turns, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but answer format is to list actions for the coming turns, I think for a sequence.\n\nThe answer format says: \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to provide a sequence of actions.\n\nBut how many? It doesn't specify, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide actions for at least 5 turns or until a decision point.\n\nBut to be safe, I can provide for 5 turns.\n\nIn this case, for turn 3,4,5,6,7.\n\nBut let's list.\n\nFirst, for turn 3: R to (4,2)\n\nThen turn 4: R to (5,2) eat\n\nThen turn 5: U to (5,3)  // from (5,2) dir R, go U\n\nThen turn 6: U to (5,4)  // from (5,3) dir U, go U\n\nThen turn 7: U to (5,5)  // from (5,4) dir U, go U\n\nThen beyond, but I can stop here for the answer, as the next moves can be decided later.\n\nBut to show the plan to (3,5), I can include up to turn 9, but not necessary.\n\nSince the question is to output for the current state, and think ahead, but the answer should be the actions starting from t1.\n\nNow, another thing: in the movement, when I go to (5,5) on turn 7, then to (4,5) on turn 8, (3,5) on turn 9.\n\nBut on turn 7, at (5,5), I go U to (5,5)? From (5,4) to (5,5) on turn 7.\n\nThen turn 8 from (5,5) to (4,5).\n\nBut (4,5) is not occupied, and (3,5) is free.\n\nIn this path, I don't have the body blocking, since the body is behind.\n\nAfter turn 4: positions [(5,2), (4,2), (3,2)]\n\nTurn 5: U to (5,3), positions [(5,3), (5,2), (4,2)]\n\nTurn 6: U to (5,4), positions [(5,4), (5,3), (5,2)]\n\nTurn 7: U to (5,5), positions [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3)]\n\nTurn 8: L to (4,5), positions: head to (4,5), body: (5,4) moves to (5,5), (5,3) moves to (5,4), so [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4)]\n\nTurn 9: L to (3,5), positions: head to (3,5), body: (5,5) moves to (4,5), (5,4) moves to (5,5), so [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5)] and eat, so new segment at (5,5)? After move to (3,5) and eat, positions: head (3,5), body (4,5), body (5,5), and new segment at previous tail position (5,5), but (5,5) is now occupied by body? After shifting, before growth: head (3,5), body (4,5), body (5,5), then new segment at (5,5) but occupied, so add at (5,5), but it's messy, but since it's the same cell, it might be okay, or in practice, the new segment is added after moving, so position (5,5) has two segments? I think it's a conflict.\n\nBetter not to have the tail position occupied multiple times.\n\nIn this case, when eating at (3,5), previous tail was at (5,5), which is now empty after move? After moving, the tail was at (5,5), but it moved to (5,5)? Positions before turn 9: [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4)]? Turn 8 positions: after L to (4,5), from [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3)]? Turn 7: [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3)]\n\nTurn 8: L to (4,5), head to (4,5), body: (5,4) moves to (5,5), (5,3) moves to (5,4), so positions [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4)]\n\nTail at (5,4).\n\nTurn 9: L to (3,5), head to (3,5), body: (5,5) moves to (4,5), (5,4) moves to (5,5), so after movement: head (3,5), body (4,5), body (5,5)\n\nThen eat, new segment added at previous tail position, which was (5,4) before move. After move, (5,4) is empty, so add new segment at (5,4).\n\nThus positions: [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,4)]\n\nLength 4.\n\nFine.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSo the plan works.\n\nTherefore, for turn 3, action is R.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output multiple turns.\n\nSince the state is given at turn 3, I should output actions for turn 3,4,5,... at least a few.\n\nPerhaps 5 turns as thinking ahead.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 3: R\n\nTurn 4: R (to eat (5,2))\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nThen for turn 8 and 9, but I can stop at turn 7.\n\nTo be complete, but the format doesn't specify how many.\n\nSince it says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" I can provide a sequence.\n\nBut in the context, I think providing up to where the immediate plan is clear.\n\nI can provide for turns 3 to 7.\n\nBut turn 7 is U to (5,5), which is fine.\n\nIn the initial thought, I had another path via left, but this is simpler.\n\nNow, about the down move: if I go down on turn 3 to (3,1), it might lead to dead end or missing food, so not good.\n\nSimilarly, going up directly to (3,5) might miss (5,2) if not careful, but (5,2) has longer life.\n\nBut in this case, with going right first, I eat (5,2) early and then (3,5) later.\n\nSo I think it's optimal.\n\nAlso, avoid risks: in this path, no collision or wall issues.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6) not relevant.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\nTurn 3: R\n\nTurn 4: R\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nBut after turn 7, I need to go to (4,5) and (3,5), but I can stop here.\n\nTo think 5 turns ahead, from turn 3 to 7 is 5 turns: t3, t4, t5, t6, t7.\n\nt3 to t7 is 5 actions.\n\nt3, t4, t5, t6, t7: that's 5 turns.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 5 is U from (5,2), which is safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I have planned a sequence of moves that prioritizes eating the positive food at (5,2) first, as it is reachable quickly and has a longer life span (until turn 10). After eating (5,2), the snake will navigate towards (3,5) to eat it before it disappears on turn 10. The food at (1,2) is not targeted due to its shorter life span (until turn 9) and the difficulty of reaching it in time without risking collision or missing other opportunities. The sequence avoids walls, obstacles, and body collisions, and adheres to the no-instant-reverse rule.\n\n### Planned Moves (5+ Turns Ahead)\n- **Turn 3**: Move right (R) to (4,2). This positions the snake closer to (5,2) and avoids immediate risks. From (3,2), moving right is safe as (4,2) is unoccupied and not a wall. Direction changes to R.\n- **Turn 4**: Move right (R) to (5,2) and eat the food. (5,2) has value +1 and life span 8 at turn 3, so it is available on turn 4 (life span decreases to 7). Eating it increases snake length to 3. Direction remains R.\n- **Turn 5**: Move up (U) to (5,3). This begins the path towards (3,5). From (5,2), moving up is safe as (5,3) is unoccupied and not a wall. Direction changes to U.\n- **Turn 6**: Move up (U) to (5,4). Continues north towards (3,5). (5,4) is unoccupied and not a wall. Direction remains U.\n- **Turn 7**: Move up (U) to (5,5). This positions the snake to turn left towards (3,5). (5,5) is unoccupied and not a wall. Direction remains U.\n\n### Beyond Turn 7 (for context, not part of output)\n- **Turn 8**: Move left (L) to (4,5). Safe as (4,5) is unoccupied and not a wall. Direction changes to L.\n- **Turn 9**: Move left (L) to (3,5) and eat the food. (3,5) has value +1 and life span 7 at turn 3, so it is available on turn 9 (life span decreases to 1). Eating it increases snake length to 4. Direction remains L.\n\nThis plan eats two food items (score +2) by turn 9 and ensures survival. It avoids the (1,2) food due to time constraints and prioritizes the safer path. The internal obstacle at (4,6) and walls are never encountered.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 3: R (right)  \nTurn 4: R (right)  \nTurn 5: U (up)  \nTurn 6: U (up)  \nTurn 7: U (up)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid? The walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. Coordinates: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, since walls are at 0 and 7.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), so that cell is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: head at (4,2), body at (3,2). So the snake is only 2 segments long right now. Head direction is R, which is right, so moving east.\n\nFood:\n\n- (1,2) with life span 6, value +1\n\n- (3,5) with life span 6, value +1\n\n- (5,2) with life span 7, value +1\n\n- (6,5) with life span 10, value +1\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value is +1 for all, and they increase length when eaten.\n\nCurrent turn: t=4.\n\nI need to plan actions for turns 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, etc., but at least 5 turns ahead. Since the snake moves one step per turn, I should think about the path for the next 5 moves.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so boundaries.\n\nInternal wall at (4,6), so (4,6) is blocked.\n\nSnake: head at (4,2), body at (3,2). Since head is moving right, and body is at (3,2), which is left of head, so the snake is horizontal, head right, tail left.\n\nAvailable moves: since head direction is R, I can go R (right), U (up), D (down), but not L (left) because that would be reverse, and no instant reverse is allowed. So possible actions: R, U, D.\n\nNow, the food:\n\n- (1,2) at y=2, x=1, life span 6. Since current turn is 4, it will disappear after turn 4 + 6 - 1? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn t, life span N means it disappears after N turns, so it will be there until turn t + N - 1.\n\nLife span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it is present for L turns starting from now.\n\nFor example, at turn t, it has life span L, so it is present at turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L.\n\nIn this case:\n\nFood at (1,2): life span 6 at turn 4, so present from turn 4 to turn 4+6-1 = turn 9, disappears at turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5): life span 6, present turns 4 to 9.\n\n(5,2): life span 7, present turns 4 to 10.\n\n(6,5): life span 10, present turns 4 to 13.\n\nAll have plenty of time.\n\nNow, I need to maximize score by eating food while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's see where the snake can go from (4,2).\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- R: to (5,2)\n\n- U: to (4,3)\n\n- D: to (4,1)\n\nBut D to (4,1): y=1, but walls at y=0, so (4,1) is within bounds? y=1 to y=6, since walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is the bottom row, not wall. Similarly, x=1 to x=6.\n\nSo (4,1) is valid.\n\nBut (4,1) has no food, I think? Food is at (1,2), (3,5), (5,2), (6,5). So (5,2) has food, (1,2) has food, but (1,2) is far.\n\n(5,2) has food with value +1, life span 7.\n\nIf I move R to (5,2), I eat the food there.\n\nBut then snake grows, so after eating, the body becomes longer.\n\nCurrent snake: positions [(4,2), (3,2)]\n\nIf I move to (5,2), I eat food, so new head at (5,2), and since I ate, length increases, so body segments: the old head (4,2) becomes body, and tail (3,2) remains, but since I ate, a new segment is added? Standard snake: when you eat, you grow, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n\n\"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food.\n\nSo when head moves to a food cell, it eats it, and the snake grows, meaning that the tail does not move that turn, so the new position has head at food cell, and the body includes all previous segments plus the previous head.\n\nAfter move: head moves to new position. If it eats food, tail stays, so snake length increases by one. If not, tail moves forward, so length same.\n\nIn this case: current state: head at (4,2), body at (3,2), so segments: index 0: head (4,2), index 1: body (3,2).\n\nAfter move, say to (5,2): new head at (5,2). Since (5,2) has food, it eats it, so tail does not move. New positions: head (5,2), body segments: (4,2) and (3,2), so now snake is [(5,2), (4,2), (3,2)].\n\nDirection: if I moved R, new head direction is R.\n\nIf I don't eat, tail moves.\n\nBut here, (5,2) has food, so if I go there, I eat.\n\nNow, risks: after eating, snake is longer, which might be riskier, but currently only 2 segments, so after eating, 3 segments.\n\nAlso, need to avoid walls and body.\n\nNow, other options: if I go U to (4,3), no food there, so just move, head to (4,3), tail moves to (4,2)? Current body is (3,2), so when head moves to (4,3), tail moves to where? The tail was at (3,2), and since no eat, tail moves forward.\n\nPositions: before move: [(4,2), (3,2)]\n\nAfter move up: head to (4,3), and since no eat, tail moves, so the body segment (3,2) is removed, and new body is the old head (4,2), so new positions: [(4,3), (4,2)]\n\nSimilarly, if down to (4,1), no food, new positions: [(4,1), (4,2)]\n\nOr if right to (5,2), eat food, new positions: [(5,2), (4,2), (3,2)]\n\nNow, after that, I need to think ahead.\n\nBut I need to plan for multiple turns.\n\nAlso, there's a rule about food under body: food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves on. But in this case, no food under snake now. Snake is at (4,2) and (3,2), food at (1,2), (3,5), (5,2), (6,5). (3,2) is body, but no food there, so all food is free.\n\n(3,2) is snake body, but no food listed at (3,2), so fine.\n\nNow, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut currently, tail is at (3,2), head at (4,2), so they are adjacent horizontally. If tail had food, but it doesn't, so no issue.\n\nNow, let's think about paths.\n\nFirst, immediate choice: I can go to (5,2) and eat the food there. That seems good, +1 score, and snake grows to length 3.\n\nBut then I'm at (5,2) with body at (4,2) and (3,2).\n\nThen from there, I need to move.\n\nPossible moves from (5,2): head direction would be R, since I moved right.\n\nCan go U (up to (5,3)), D (down to (5,1)), R (right to (6,2)), or L (left to (4,2)) but (4,2) is body, so collision, can't go there.\n\nAlso, L is reverse? Head direction is R, so moving L would be opposite, so not allowed anyway.\n\nSo possible: U, D, R.\n\n(6,2) has no food, (5,3) no food, (5,1) no food.\n\nFood at (6,5) and (3,5), etc.\n\nBut (6,5) is at x=6,y=5.\n\nFrom (5,2), if I go R to (6,2), then I'm at (6,2), no food, so positions: head (6,2), body (5,2), (4,2)? After eating at (5,2), positions [(5,2),(4,2),(3,2)]\n\nIf I move R to (6,2), no food there, so tail moves: new head (6,2), body: (5,2) and (4,2), tail (3,2) removed. So snake [(6,2), (5,2), (4,2)]\n\nLength 3.\n\nThen from (6,2), head direction R, can go U, D, L (but L to (5,2) is body, collision, so not possible), or R to (7,2) but x=7 is wall, so invalid. U to (6,3), D to (6,1).\n\nSo only U or D.\n\nSimilarly, if I go U to (6,3), then from there, etc.\n\nBut this might not be efficient for getting more food.\n\nIf from (5,2) I go U to (5,3), no food, then positions: head (5,3), body (5,2) and (4,2)? After move from (5,2) to (5,3), no eat, so tail moves, so snake [(5,3), (5,2), (4,2)]\n\nThen from (5,3), head dir U, can go U to (5,4), D to (5,2) but body, collision, L to (4,3), R to (6,3).\n\n(4,3) is free? Currently body is (5,2) and (4,2), so (4,3) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) free.\n\nFood at (6,5) and (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is at x=3,y=5.\n\nFrom (5,3), I can go L to (4,3), then U to (4,4), etc., towards (3,5).\n\nOr go R to (6,3), then U to (6,4), (6,5) has food.\n\n(6,5) has food, life span 10, so I can go there.\n\nBut let's see the other immediate choice: at turn 4, instead of going to (5,2), I could go up or down.\n\nFor example, go U to (4,3).\n\nThen no eat, positions: head (4,3), body (4,2) [since tail moved from (3,2) to (4,2)? Before move: [(4,2),(3,2)]\n\nMove U to (4,3): new head (4,3), no eat, so tail moves: the last segment (3,2) is removed, and body is now [(4,3), (4,2)]\n\nSo snake at (4,3) and (4,2), vertical.\n\nHead direction U.\n\nThen from (4,3), can go U to (4,4), D to (4,2) but body, collision, L to (3,3), R to (5,3).\n\n(3,3) and (5,3) free.\n\nFood at (3,5) and (5,2), (1,2), etc.\n\n(5,2) is below, but head at (4,3), so to go to (5,2), I need to go down and right, but might not be direct.\n\nIf I go down to (4,1) at turn 4, then positions: [(4,1), (4,2)], head dir D.\n\nThen can go L to (3,1), R to (5,1), D to (4,0) but y=0 wall, invalid, so only L or R.\n\n(3,1) or (5,1), both no food.\n\nFood at (1,2) and (5,2), so from (4,1), I can go to (3,1) then to (3,2) or something, but (3,2) is not food, food at (1,2).\n\n(1,2) has food.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (1,2). It's at (1,2), life span 6, so disappears at turn 10, but I need to get there soon.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) at turn 9, (5,2) at turn 10, (6,5) at turn 13.\n\n(5,2) is close, at (5,2), I can eat it now.\n\nBut if I eat it, snake grows, might be harder to maneuver.\n\nSince snake is short, growing is fine.\n\nAnother thing: internal wall at (4,6), so y=6 is top row, but (4,6) is blocked, so at y=6, x=4 is wall.\n\nBut food at (3,5) and (6,5), both y=5, not affected.\n\ny=6 has wall at (4,6), but other cells at y=6 might be free? Walls: border x=0,7 y=0,7, and internal obstacle (4,6), so (4,6) is wall, other cells at y=6 are not walls, since only internal obstacle is (4,6).\n\nBorder walls are the edges, so cells with x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 are playable except (4,6) is obstacle.\n\nSo for example, (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (5,6), (6,6) are free, but (4,6) blocked.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nNow, back to decision.\n\nI should consider the value of each food and how to get them efficiently.\n\nAll food +1, so same value, but some are closer.\n\n(5,2) is very close, at (5,2), I can eat it on turn 4 by moving R.\n\nThen snake at [(5,2),(4,2),(3,2)]\n\nFrom there, I can go U to (5,3), for example.\n\nThen to (5,4), etc., towards (3,5) or (6,5).\n\n(3,5) is at (3,5), which is left and up.\n\nFrom (5,3), I can go L to (4,3), then L to (3,3), then U to (3,4), U to (3,5), and eat.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) from (5,3) go R to (6,3), U to (6,4), U to (6,5).\n\nBut (6,5) has longer life, so less urgent.\n\nAlso, (1,2) is at (1,2), which is left, but snake body is at (3,2), so (1,2) is free, but to get there, from current position (4,2), if I don't eat (5,2), I could go left, but head direction R, I can't go left immediately, reverse not allowed.\n\nFrom (4,2), head dir R, I can go U or D, not L.\n\nSo to go to (1,2), I need to go up or down first, then left.\n\nFor example, go U to (4,3), then from there, head dir U, I can go L to (3,3), then D to (3,2), but (3,2) is where the tail was, but after moving to (4,3), tail is at (4,2), so (3,2) is free.\n\nAfter moving to (4,3), positions [(4,3),(4,2)], so (3,2) is empty.\n\nFrom (4,3), I can go L to (3,3), then from (3,3), head dir L, I can go L to (2,3), D to (3,2), etc.\n\nTo (1,2), from (3,2) go L to (2,2), then to (1,2).\n\nBut (3,2) might have been tail, but after moves, it could be free.\n\nBut let's think turns.\n\nAt turn 4, if I go U to (4,3), positions: [(4,3),(4,2)]\n\nTurn 5, from (4,3), head dir U, I can go L to (3,3), positions: new head (3,3), no food (assuming), so tail moves, snake [(3,3),(4,3)]? Before: [(4,3),(4,2)], move to (3,3), no eat, so head to (3,3), body to (4,3), tail (4,2) removed. So [(3,3),(4,3)]\n\nHead direction L (since moved left).\n\nThen turn 6, from (3,3), can go L to (2,3), U to (3,4), D to (3,2), etc.\n\nIf I go D to (3,2), (3,2) has no food, so positions: head (3,2), body (3,3), so [(3,2),(3,3)]\n\nThen turn 7, from (3,2), head dir D (since moved down), can go L to (2,2), D to (3,1), R to (4,2) but body? Body is (3,3), so (4,2) free? Positions: head (3,2), body (3,3), so (4,2) free.\n\nGo L to (2,2), no food, then positions [(2,2),(3,2)]\n\nThen turn 8, from (2,2) to (1,2), eat food.\n\n(1,2) has food, so eat at turn 8.\n\nBut life span of (1,2) is 6 at turn 4, so present until turn 9, so turn 8 is fine.\n\nSimilarly, if I go directly.\n\nBut this takes 4 moves to eat (1,2): turn 4 U, turn 5 L, turn 6 D, turn 7 L, turn 8 eat at (1,2).\n\nTurn 4: start (4,2), go U to (4,3)\n\nTurn 5: at (4,3) go L to (3,3)\n\nTurn 6: at (3,3) go D to (3,2)  // but (3,2) is not food, and I can go to (3,2) directly if possible, but from (3,3) go D to (3,2)\n\nThen at (3,2), no food, positions: after move, head (3,2), body (3,3)\n\nThen turn 7: from (3,2) go L to (2,2), no food\n\nThen turn 8: from (2,2) go L to (1,2), eat.\n\nSo eat at turn 8.\n\nBut on turn 6, from (3,3), instead of going D to (3,2), I could go L to (2,3), then to (2,2), etc., but similar.\n\nBut (3,2) is empty at that time.\n\nNow, compare to eating (5,2) immediately: at turn 4 go R to (5,2), eat, snake length 3: [(5,2),(4,2),(3,2)]\n\nThen turn 5, from (5,2) I can go U to (5,3), no food, positions: head (5,3), body (5,2) and (4,2) — since no eat, tail moves, so body (5,2) and (4,2), tail (3,2) removed, so [(5,3),(5,2),(4,2)]\n\nHead dir U.\n\nThen turn 6, from (5,3) go L to (4,3), no food, positions: head (4,3), body (5,3) and (5,2) — move to (4,3), no eat, so head (4,3), body: (5,3) and (5,2)? Let's trace positions.\n\nAfter turn 5: positions [(5,3),(5,2),(4,2)]\n\nMove to (4,3): new head (4,3), no food, so tail moves: last segment (4,2) removed, body segments shift: so new body is (5,3) and (5,2), but (5,2) is before (5,3)? Order: head first, so after move, head at (4,3), then the previous head (5,3) becomes body, and (5,2) is also body, but since tail moved, the last segment (4,2) is gone, so positions: [(4,3), (5,3), (5,2)]\n\n(5,2) is the tail.\n\nHead direction L (moved left).\n\nThen from (4,3), I can go to (3,5) or (1,2), but (1,2) is far.\n\nTo (3,5): from (4,3) head dir L, can go U to (4,4), but head dir L, after moving left, new dir is L.\n\nFrom (4,3), dir L, can go U to (4,4), D to (4,2), L to (3,3), R to (5,3) but body.\n\n(5,3) is body, so can't go R.\n\nL to (3,3) or U to (4,4) or D to (4,2).\n\n(4,2) might be free, but in positions, (5,2) is tail, so (4,2) is empty.\n\nGo L to (3,3), no food, then to (3,4), then to (3,5) eat.\n\nTurn 6: from (4,3) go L to (3,3), positions: head (3,3), body (4,3) and (5,3) — no eat, tail (5,2) removed, so [(3,3),(4,3),(5,3)]? After move: new head (3,3), body segments: previous head (4,3) and (5,3), tail (5,2) gone, so [(3,3),(4,3),(5,3)] but (5,3) is the second segment, but positions should be in order, so [(3,3), (4,3), (5,3)] with (5,3) tail.\n\nHead dir L.\n\nThen turn 7, from (3,3) go U to (3,4), no food, positions: head (3,4), body (3,3) and (4,3)\n\nHead dir U.\n\nThen turn 8, from (3,4) go U to (3,5), eat food.\n\nSo eat (3,5) at turn 8.\n\n(3,5) life span until turn 9, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (5,2) first, I can eat (5,2) at turn 4, then go to (3,5) by turn 8.\n\nBut if I don't eat (5,2), I can eat (1,2) at turn 8 or earlier.\n\nAt turn 4, if I go U to (4,3), then as before, I can reach (1,2) by turn 8.\n\nOr, from (4,3), I can go towards (3,5) faster.\n\nFor example, turn 4: go U to (4,3)\n\nTurn 5: from (4,3) go U to (4,4) (if head dir U, go U to (4,4)), no food, positions: after turn 4, [(4,3),(4,2)]\n\nMove U to (4,4): new head (4,4), body to (4,3), tail (4,2) removed, so [(4,4),(4,3)]\n\nHead dir U.\n\nTurn 6: from (4,4) go U to (4,5), no food, positions: [(4,5),(4,4)]\n\nThen turn 7: from (4,5) go L to (3,5), but (3,5) has food, so eat at (3,5).\n\nFrom (4,5), head dir U, can go L to (3,5), which is adjacent.\n\nMove to (3,5), eat food.\n\nSo eat at turn 7.\n\nFaster than before.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 4: U to (4,3) , positions [(4,3),(4,2)]\n\nHead dir U.\n\nTurn 5: U to (4,4) , positions [(4,4),(4,3)] (tail moved)\n\nTurn 6: U to (4,5) , positions [(4,5),(4,4)]\n\nHead dir U.\n\nTurn 7: L to (3,5) , eat food, so positions new head (3,5), body: (4,5) and (4,4) since grow, tail not move, so [(3,5), (4,5), (4,4)]\n\nAnd score +1.\n\nCompared to eating (5,2) first: if I eat (5,2) at turn 4, then go to (3,5) at turn 8, as earlier.\n\nWith this, I eat (3,5) at turn 7, but I didn't eat (5,2), so I missed that food.\n\n(5,2) is still there, life span 7, until turn 10, so I can eat it later.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) until turn 9.\n\nNow, another option: at turn 4, go D to (4,1).\n\nThen positions [(4,1),(4,2)]\n\nHead dir D.\n\nThen I can go L to (3,1), or R to (5,1), etc., but not direct to food, and (5,2) is above, so I need to go up later.\n\nFor example, to eat (5,2), from (4,1) go R to (5,1), then U to (5,2) eat, but at turn 5 or 6.\n\nTurn 4: go D to (4,1), positions [(4,1),(4,2)]\n\nTurn 5: from (4,1) go R to (5,1), no food, positions [(5,1),(4,1)] (tail moved)\n\nHead dir R.\n\nTurn 6: from (5,1) go U to (5,2), eat food, so eat at turn 6.\n\nBut snake is at [(5,2), (5,1), (4,1)] after eating.\n\nThen from there, I can go to other food.\n\nBut eating at turn 6 is later than turn 4.\n\nSimilarly, for (1,2), from (4,1) go L to (3,1), L to (2,1), L to (1,1), U to (1,2) eat, but (1,1) to (1,2) up.\n\nBut (1,1) is within bounds? y=1 to 6, x=1 to 6, so (1,1) is corner.\n\nTurn 4: go D to (4,1)\n\nTurn 5: go L to (3,1), positions [(3,1),(4,1)]\n\nHead dir L.\n\nTurn 6: go L to (2,1), positions [(2,1),(3,1)]\n\nTurn 7: go L to (1,1), positions [(1,1),(2,1)]\n\nTurn 8: go U to (1,2), eat.\n\nEat at turn 8.\n\nBut if I go up first, I can eat (3,5) at turn 7 or (1,2) at turn 8.\n\nNow, the food at (6,5) has long life, so I can get it later.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nAlso, after eating one food, snake is longer, which might block paths.\n\nCurrently snake short, so growing is good for score, but need to avoid dead ends.\n\nLet's consider the grid and possible paths to all food.\n\nFood locations: (1,2), (3,5), (5,2), (6,5)\n\n(5,2) is very close, at adjacent cell right.\n\nBy not eating it, I might miss it if something happens, but life span 7, so until turn 10.\n\nBut if I don't eat it now, I can eat it later, but I need to come back.\n\nFor example, if I go up to (4,3), then to (3,5) by turn 7, then after that, I can go down to eat (5,2) or to (1,2).\n\nBut after eating (3,5), snake is at [(3,5),(4,5),(4,4)], for example, as in earlier sequence.\n\nThen from (3,5), head dir L (since moved left to (3,5)? In the sequence: at turn 7, from (4,5) go L to (3,5), so head dir L.\n\nThen turn 8, from (3,5) can go U to (3,6), D to (3,4), L to (2,5), R to (4,5) but body.\n\n(4,5) is body, so can't go R.\n\nU to (3,6): y=6, but (3,6) is not wall, only (4,6) is wall, so (3,6) free.\n\nD to (3,4), L to (2,5), etc.\n\nTo go to (5,2), I need to go down and right.\n\nFor example, go D to (3,4), then to (4,4), but (4,4) is body? After eating (3,5), positions [(3,5),(4,5),(4,4)], so (4,4) is tail.\n\nFrom (3,5) go D to (3,4), no food, positions: head (3,4), body (3,5) and (4,5) — tail (4,4) removed, so [(3,4),(3,5),(4,5)]\n\nHead dir D.\n\nThen turn 9, from (3,4) go R to (4,4)? (4,4) is empty now? Positions have (4,5) and (3,5), so (4,4) free.\n\nGo R to (4,4), no food, positions [(4,4),(3,4),(3,5)]? New head (4,4), body (3,4) and (3,5), tail (4,5) removed? Let's see: previous positions [(3,4),(3,5),(4,5)], move to (4,4), no eat, so head (4,4), body segments: (3,4) and (3,5), tail (4,5) gone, so [(4,4),(3,4),(3,5)]\n\nBut (3,5) is not adjacent to (4,4), but in snake, segments are connected, so positions should be contiguous, but (4,4) to (3,4) adjacent, (3,4) to (3,5) adjacent, so ok.\n\nHead dir R.\n\nThen from (4,4) can go to (5,4), etc., but (5,2) is below.\n\nGo D to (4,3), but need to go down.\n\nFrom (4,4) go D to (4,3), no food, etc., to reach (5,2).\n\nBut (5,2) might be eaten by then or not, but it's there.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nIf I eat (5,2) first at turn 4, then I have score +1, and snake at (5,2), then I can go to (3,5) by turn 8 as before.\n\nThen from (3,5), I can go to (1,2) or (6,5).\n\n(1,2) life span until turn 9, so I need to eat by turn 9.\n\nTurn 8 eat (3,5), so on turn 9, I can go towards (1,2).\n\nFrom (3,5) after eating, positions [(3,5),(4,5),(4,4)] if I came from (4,5), but in the earlier sequence with eating (5,2) first: turn 4 eat (5,2), positions [(5,2),(4,2),(3,2)]\n\nTurn 5 go U to (5,3), positions [(5,3),(5,2),(4,2)] (tail moved)\n\nTurn 6 go L to (4,3), positions [(4,3),(5,3),(5,2)]? After move to (4,3), head (4,3), body (5,3) and (5,2), tail (4,2) removed, so [(4,3),(5,3),(5,2)]\n\nHead dir L.\n\nTurn 7 go U to (4,4), no food, positions: head (4,4), body (4,3) and (5,3), tail (5,2) removed, so [(4,4),(4,3),(5,3)]\n\nHead dir U.\n\nTurn 8 go L to (3,4), no food, positions: head (3,4), body (4,4) and (4,3), tail (5,3) removed, so [(3,4),(4,4),(4,3)]\n\nHead dir L.\n\nTurn 9 go U to (3,5), eat, so positions new head (3,5), body (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) since grow, so [(3,5),(3,4),(4,4),(4,3)]\n\nLength 4.\n\nThen to go to (1,2), from (3,5) head dir U (moved up to (3,5)), can go D to (3,4), but (3,4) is body, collision, L to (2,5), U to (3,6), R to (4,5) but (4,5) might be free.\n\nPositions: (3,5) head, (3,4) body, (4,4) body, (4,3) tail.\n\nSo (4,5) free, (2,5) free, (3,6) free.\n\nGo L to (2,5), for example, then to (2,4), (2,3), etc. to (1,2).\n\nBut (1,2) at turn 9, I can eat on turn 10 if I move fast, but life span until turn 9, so must eat by turn 9.\n\nAt turn 9, I am at (3,5), and (1,2) is at distance.\n\nFrom (3,5) to (1,2): delta x=2, delta y=3, so Manhattan distance 5, but with turns, minimum 5 moves, but I need to be there on turn 9 to eat, but at turn 9 I am at (3,5), so I can't reach (1,2) on turn 9; the earliest is turn 10, but (1,2) disappears at turn 10? Life span 6 at turn 4, present turns 4 to 9, disappears at turn 10, so must eat by turn 9.\n\nAt turn 9 I am at (3,5), so I can't reach (1,2) by turn 9; it's too far.\n\nFor example, from (3,5) turn 9 go L to (2,5), turn 10 go to (2,4) or (1,5), but (1,2) not reachable by turn 9.\n\nSo if I eat (3,5) at turn 9, I miss (1,2) because it disappears.\n\nIf I don't eat (5,2) and go directly to (1,2), I can eat it at turn 8, as in the first sequence.\n\nThen after that, I can go to (3,5) or (5,2).\n\n(3,5) life span until turn 9, so after eating (1,2) at turn 8, I can go to (3,5).\n\nFrom (1,2) after eating, positions: in the sequence where I go to (1,2) directly.\n\nTurn 4: U to (4,3)\n\nTurn 5: L to (3,3)\n\nTurn 6: D to (3,2)  // no food\n\nTurn 7: L to (2,2)  // no food\n\nTurn 8: L to (1,2) eat, so positions: head (1,2), body (2,2), and (3,2) since grow? Before move: at turn 7, positions after turn 6: from turn 6, after move to (3,2), positions [(3,2),(3,3)]? Let's track:\n\nTurn 4: start [(4,2),(3,2)] go U to (4,3), no eat, positions [(4,3),(4,2)]\n\nTurn 5: from (4,3) go L to (3,3), no eat, positions [(3,3),(4,3)]\n\nTurn 6: from (3,3) go D to (3,2), no eat, positions [(3,2),(3,3)]\n\nTurn 7: from (3,2) go L to (2,2), no eat, positions [(2,2),(3,2)]\n\nTurn 8: from (2,2) go L to (1,2), eat, so new head (1,2), body (2,2) and (3,2) since grow, so [(1,2),(2,2),(3,2)]\n\nHead dir L.\n\nThen turn 9, from (1,2) can go U to (1,3), D to (1,1), L to (0,2) wall invalid, R to (2,2) body collision.\n\nSo only U or D.\n\nGo U to (1,3), no food, positions: head (1,3), body (1,2) and (2,2), tail (3,2) removed, so [(1,3),(1,2),(2,2)]\n\nThen to go to (3,5), it's far, and (3,5) disappears after turn 9, so on turn 9 I am at (1,3) or (1,2), can't reach (3,5) by turn 9.\n\nSo I miss (3,5).\n\nIf after eating (1,2) at turn 8, I go up, but (3,5) is at (3,5), from (1,2) to (3,5) is |dx|=2, |dy=3|, min 5 moves, turn 9,10,11,12,13, but (3,5) gone after turn 9, so impossible to eat.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) is at (5,2), life until turn 10, so I can eat on turn 10 or later.\n\nBut to eat (5,2), from (1,3) or wherever, it takes moves.\n\nSo, trade-off: if I eat (5,2) now, I get +1 immediately, and can eat (3,5) by turn 8 or 9, but miss (1,2) because it's far.\n\nIf I go for (1,2) first, I eat at turn 8, but miss (3,5) and possibly (5,2) if not careful.\n\nAnother option: go for (3,5) first via the short path.\n\nFrom turn 4 go U to (4,3)\n\nTurn 5 U to (4,4)\n\nTurn 6 U to (4,5)\n\nTurn 7 L to (3,5) eat.\n\nSo eat (3,5) at turn 7.\n\nThen positions [(3,5),(4,5),(4,4)]\n\nHead dir L.\n\nThen turn 8, from (3,5) I can go D to (3,4), no food, positions: head (3,4), body (3,5) and (4,5), tail (4,4) removed, so [(3,4),(3,5),(4,5)]\n\nHead dir D.\n\nThen I can go to (3,2) or something to eat (1,2) or (5,2).\n\n(1,2) until turn 9, so at turn 8 I am at (3,4), to (1,2): go L to (2,4) or D to (3,3), etc.\n\nTurn 8: from (3,4) go D to (3,3), no food, positions: head (3,3), body (3,4) and (3,5), tail (4,5) removed, so [(3,3),(3,4),(3,5)]\n\nHead dir D.\n\nTurn 9: from (3,3) go D to (3,2), no food, positions: head (3,2), body (3,3) and (3,4), tail (3,5) removed, so [(3,2),(3,3),(3,4)]\n\nThen (1,2) is at (1,2), from (3,2) go L to (2,2), turn 10, but (1,2) disappears at turn 10, so on turn 10, if I go to (1,2), it might be gone.\n\nLife span: at turn 4, life span 6, so present turns 4,5,6,7,8,9, disappears at turn 10.\n\nSo on turn 9, it is present, I can eat on turn 9.\n\nAt turn 9, I am at (3,2), and (1,2) is at (1,2), so I can go L to (2,2) on turn 9, but (2,2) not food, or directly to (1,2)? From (3,2) to (1,2) is two steps left, but I can only move one cell per turn.\n\nFrom (3,2) at turn 9, I can go L to (2,2) on turn 9, but (2,2) not food, then on turn 10 to (1,2), but (1,2) gone on turn 10.\n\nSo I cannot eat (1,2) after turn 9; last chance turn 9.\n\nAt turn 9, I need to be at (1,2) to eat.\n\nBut at turn 9, in this sequence, I am at (3,2), so I can't.\n\nIf from turn 8 at (3,4), I go directly west.\n\nTurn 8 at (3,4), go L to (2,4), no food, positions: head (2,4), body (3,4) and (3,5), tail (4,5) removed, so [(2,4),(3,4),(3,5)]\n\nHead dir L.\n\nTurn 9: from (2,4) go L to (1,4), no food, positions: head (1,4), body (2,4) and (3,4), tail (3,5) removed, so [(1,4),(2,4),(3,4)]\n\nThen (1,2) is below, but I am at (1,4), can go D to (1,3), then to (1,2) on turn 10, gone.\n\nStill miss.\n\nSo to eat both (1,2) and (3,5), I need to eat (1,2) first or eat (3,5) quickly and then (1,2), but from above, it's tight.\n\nIf I eat (5,2) at turn 4, then go to (1,2), but (1,2) far.\n\nTurn 4 eat (5,2), positions [(5,2),(4,2),(3,2)]\n\nTurn 5: go L to (4,2), but (4,2) is body, collision, cannot.\n\nGo U to (5,3), as before.\n\nThen to go west, turn 5 go U to (5,3), positions [(5,3),(5,2),(4,2)]\n\nTurn 6 go L to (4,3), positions [(4,3),(5,3),(5,2)]\n\nTurn 7 go L to (3,3), positions [(3,3),(4,3),(5,3)]\n\nTurn 8 go L to (2,3), positions [(2,3),(3,3),(4,3)]\n\nTurn 9 go L to (1,3), positions [(1,3),(2,3),(3,3)]\n\nThen (1,2) is below, go D to (1,2) on turn 10, but gone.\n\nOr from (2,3) turn 9 go D to (2,2), then to (1,2) turn 10, gone.\n\nCan't reach (1,2) by turn 9 if I eat (5,2) first.\n\nThe only way to eat (1,2) is to go directly towards it from turn 4 without eating (5,2).\n\nFor example, turn 4 go U to (4,3)\n\nTurn 5 go L to (3,3)\n\nTurn 6 go D to (3,2)  // no food, but (3,2) was tail, now free\n\nTurn 7 go L to (2,2)\n\nTurn 8 go L to (1,2) eat.\n\nAs before.\n\nThen after that, (3,5) can be eaten if I go directly, but at turn 8 I am at (1,2), (3,5) at (3,5), distance min 4 moves, turn 9,10,11,12, but (3,5) gone after turn 9, so impossible.\n\nSo I can eat either (1,2) or (3,5), but not both, because of the life spans.\n\n(1,2) life span 6, turn 4 to 9.\n\n(3,5) life span 6, turn 4 to 9.\n\n(5,2) life span 7, turn 4 to 10.\n\n(6,5) life span 10, turn 4 to 13.\n\nSo (1,2) and (3,5) both disappear after turn 9.\n\nSince they are at opposite corners, and snake starts in middle, I can only reach one of them by turn 8 or 9.\n\nWith current position, to (1,2) min 4 moves, to (3,5) min 3 moves (e.g., U,U,L or U,L,U etc.).\n\nTo (3,5) from (4,2): one up to (4,3), another up to (4,4), another up to (4,5), then left to (3,5), 4 moves, but I can go directly in 3 moves if I go diagonal, but must move orthogonally.\n\nMinimum Manhattan distance to (3,5): from (4,2) to (3,5) is |4-3| + |2-5| = 1+3=4 moves.\n\nSimilarly to (1,2): |4-1| + |2-2| =3+0=3 moves, but I can't go left directly because of direction.\n\nFrom (4,2) head R, can go U, D, R.\n\nGo R to (5,2) is one move, but that's east.\n\nTo go west, I need to go U or D first.\n\nSo to (1,2), I can go U to (4,3), then L to (3,3), then D to (3,2), then L to (2,2), L to (1,2), 5 moves.\n\nOr go D to (4,1), then L to (3,1), L to (2,1), L to (1,1), U to (1,2), 5 moves.\n\nOr from (4,2) go U to (4,3), then L to (3,3), L to (2,3), D to (2,2), L to (1,2), still 5.\n\nMinimum 4 moves? For example, if I could go left directly, but I can't.\n\nSo earliest to eat (1,2) is turn 8, as above.\n\nSimilarly for (3,5): from (4,2) go U to (4,3) turn 5, U to (4,4) turn 6, U to (4,5) turn 7, L to (3,5) turn 8, eat turn 8.\n\nOr if I go U to (4,3) turn 5, then U to (4,4) turn 6, then L to (3,4) turn 7, U to (3,5) turn 8, same.\n\nCan I do in 3 moves? For example, from (4,2) go U to (4,3), then from (4,3) go L to (3,3), then U to (3,4), then to (3,5) on fourth move. No 3 moves from start.\n\nSo both (1,2) and (3,5) can be eaten by turn 8 at earliest.\n\nBut since I can only be at one place, I can eat one of them by turn 8, but not both, because after eating one, it takes time to go to the other.\n\nFor example, from (1,2) to (3,5) is |1-3| + |2-5| =2+3=5 moves, so from turn 8 to turn 13, but both gone after turn 9, so impossible to eat both.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat (3,5) at turn 7 or 8, I can't reach (1,2) by turn 9.\n\nSo I must choose which one to eat, or neither.\n\nBut eating one is better than none.\n\n(5,2) can be eaten later, life until turn 10.\n\n(6,5) until turn 13.\n\nSo perhaps I should eat (5,2) now since it's easy, then go to one of the others.\n\nBut which one? (3,5) is closer than (1,2).\n\nFrom (5,2), to (3,5): |5-3| + |2-5| =2+3=5 moves min.\n\nTo (1,2): |5-1| + |2-2| =4+0=4 moves, but again, with direction.\n\nAfter eating (5,2) at turn 4, at turn 5 I am at (5,2) with body, but I can move.\n\nTurn 5 go U to (5,3), then turn 6 go L to (4,3), turn 7 L to (3,3), turn 8 U to (3,4), turn 9 U to (3,5) eat, so eat at turn 9, which is possible since life until turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, to (1,2): from (5,2) turn 5 go L to (4,2), but (4,2) is body, collision, cannot.\n\nGo U to (5,3), then L to (4,3), L to (3,3), D to (3,2), L to (2,2), L to (1,2) turn 10, gone.\n\nOr go D to (5,1), then L to (4,1), L to (3,1), L to (2,1), L to (1,1), U to (1,2) turn 10, gone.\n\nSo from (5,2), I can reach (3,5) by turn 9, but not (1,2).\n\nIf I don't eat (5,2), I can reach (1,2) by turn 8 or (3,5) by turn 8.\n\nSo choices:\n\n- Eat (5,2) at turn 4, then eat (3,5) at turn 9, missing (1,2)\n\n- Or, go for (1,2) and eat at turn 8, missing (3,5) and (5,2) for now, but can eat (5,2) later\n\n- Or go for (3,5) and eat at turn 7 or 8, then miss (1,2), but can eat (5,2) later.\n\n(5,2) can be eaten later, life until turn 10.\n\nFor example, if I eat (3,5) at turn 7, then at turn 8 I can go towards (5,2).\n\nFrom (3,5) after eating at turn 7, positions [(3,5),(4,5),(4,4)]\n\nHead dir L.\n\nTurn 8 go D to (3,4), no food, positions [(3,4),(3,5),(4,5)]\n\nHead dir D.\n\nTurn 9 go D to (3,3), no food, positions [(3,3),(3,4),(3,5)]\n\nHead dir D.\n\nTurn 10 go D to (3,2), no food, positions [(3,2),(3,3),(3,4)]\n\nThen from (3,2), I can go to (5,2) or eat it if I go east.\n\n(5,2) is at (5,2), from (3,2) go R to (4,2), turn 11, then R to (5,2) turn 12, but (5,2) life until turn 10, so on turn 11 it is gone.\n\nLife span 7 at turn 4, present turns 4 to 10, disappears at turn 11.\n\nSo must eat by turn 10.\n\nAt turn 10, I am at (3,2), and (5,2) is at (5,2), so I can go R to (4,2) on turn 10, but (4,2) not food, then on turn 11 to (5,2), gone.\n\nOr directly, but can't, so I cannot eat (5,2) if I go to (3,5) first, because after eating (3,5) at turn 7, I need at least 3 moves to reach (5,2): from (3,5) to (5,2) min |3-5| + |5-2| =2+3=5 moves, turn 8,9,10,11,12, eat at turn 12, but gone at turn 11.\n\nAt turn 10, I can be at (5,2) only if I start from closer.\n\nFor example, if at turn 7 I am at (3,5), to be at (5,2) on turn 10, I need to move south-east.\n\nTurn 8 from (3,5) go D to (3,4)\n\nTurn 9 go R to (4,4)\n\nTurn 10 go D to (4,3) or something, not (5,2).\n\nTo reach (5,2) on turn 10, from (3,5) on turn 7, I need 3 moves: possible paths, e.g., D to (3,4) turn 8, DR to (4,3) but not diagonal, move one step.\n\nTurn 8: D to (3,4)\n\nTurn 9: R to (4,4)\n\nTurn 10: D to (4,3), not (5,2)\n\nOr turn 8: R to (4,5) but if possible, from (3,5) go R to (4,5), then turn 9 D to (4,4), turn 10 D to (4,3), still not.\n\nCan't reach (5,2) in 3 moves from (3,5); min 4 moves to (5,2): e.g., D,R,D,R or something.\n\n|3-5|=2, |5-2|=3, min 5 moves.\n\nSo from turn 7 to turn 11 or 12, too late.\n\nSimilarly, if I go for (1,2) first, I can eat (5,2) later if I position well.\n\nAfter eating (1,2) at turn 8, positions [(1,2),(2,2),(3,2)]\n\nHead dir L.\n\nThen turn 9, go U to (1,3) or D to (1,1).\n\nSay go U to (1,3), positions [(1,3),(1,2),(2,2)]\n\nHead dir U.\n\nTurn 10, from (1,3) go U to (1,4), or R to (2,3), etc.\n\n(5,2) is at (5,2), life until turn 10, so on turn 10 I can be at (5,2) if I move fast, but from (1,3) to (5,2) is |1-5| + |3-2| =4+1=5 moves, turn 10 to 14, can't reach by turn 10.\n\nSo I cannot eat (5,2) after going to (1,2).\n\nThe only way to eat (5,2) is to eat it at turn 4 or go to it directly without detour.\n\nFor example, if at turn 4 I go R to (5,2) eat.\n\nOr if I don't, but go U or D, then later I can go to (5,2) but it might be tight.\n\nSuppose at turn 4 I go U to (4,3), then I can go to (5,2) by turn 6 or 7.\n\nTurn 4 U to (4,3), positions [(4,3),(4,2)]\n\nHead dir U.\n\nTurn 5, from (4,3) go R to (5,3), no food, positions [(5,3),(4,3)]\n\nHead dir R.\n\nTurn 6, from (5,3) go D to (5,2), eat, so eat at turn 6.\n\nPositions new head (5,2), body (5,3) and (4,3), since grow, so [(5,2),(5,3),(4,3)]\n\nThen I have eaten (5,2) at turn 6, and I can still go to (3,5) or (1,2).\n\n(3,5) life until turn 9, so I can reach it.\n\nFrom (5,2) after eating, head dir D (moved down to (5,2)), can go L to (4,2), U to (5,3) but body, R to (6,2), D to (5,1).\n\n(4,2) is free? Positions have (5,3) and (4,3), so (4,2) free.\n\nGo L to (4,2), no food, positions: head (4,2), body (5,2) and (5,3), tail (4,3) removed, so [(4,2),(5,2),(5,3)]\n\nHead dir L.\n\nThen go U to (4,3), but (4,3) might be free, etc., to (3,5).\n\nTurn 7 go L to (4,2)? From (4,2) head dir L, can go U to (4,3), D to (4,1), L to (3,2).\n\nGo U to (4,3), no food, positions: head (4,3), body (4,2) and (5,2), tail (5,3) removed, so [(4,3),(4,2),(5,2)]\n\nHead dir U.\n\nTurn 8 go U to (4,4), no food, positions [(4,4),(4,3),(4,2)]\n\nHead dir U.\n\nTurn 9 go U to (4,5), then L to (3,5) eat on turn 10, but (3,5) gone after turn 9, so turn 10 too late.\n\nFrom (4,3) turn 7, go L to (3,3), then U to (3,4), U to (3,5) turn 10, late.\n\nSo not possible to eat (3,5) after eating (5,2) at turn 6.\n\nSimilarly for (1,2), from (5,2) at turn 6, to (1,2) min 4 moves, turn 10, gone.\n\nSo the best is to eat (5,2) at turn 4, then eat (3,5) at turn 9, as in the first sequence, and forget about (1,2).\n\nOr eat (3,5) at turn 7 and eat (5,2) at turn 6 as above, but in that case I ate (5,2) at turn 6 and (3,5) at turn 7 is not possible from there.\n\nIf I go to (3,5) first without eating (5,2), I can eat (3,5) at turn 7, then I have time for (6,5) or other, but (5,2) I can eat only if I do it early.\n\nSince (6,5) has long life, I can get it later.\n\nAlso, there is the internal wall at (4,6), but not blocking much.\n\nPrioritize long-term survival: since grid is small, and snake grows, I need to avoid boxing myself in.\n\nBut with only 3 food, and one with long life, I can plan.\n\nPerhaps the optimal is to eat (5,2) at turn 4 for immediate score, then go to (3,5) and eat at turn 9, then go to (6,5) for another score.\n\nAnd (1,2) will disappear, but I can't get it anyway.\n\nSimilarly, if I go for (1,2), I eat at turn 8, then I can go to (6,5) or (5,2) but (5,2) gone, so only (6,5).\n\nBut with (6,5) life long, I can get it.\n\nBut I have only one score if I go for (1,2), whereas with the other, I get two scores.\n\nBy eating (5,2) and (3,5), I get two, plus (6,5) later.\n\nBy going for (1,2), I get only one plus (6,5).\n\nSo better to eat (5,2) and (3,5).\n\nAnd for (6,5), I can get it after.\n\nAlso, no negative food, so all food is good.\n\nSo let's plan the actions.\n\nTurn 4: go R to (5,2) eat food there.\n\nPositions: head (5,2), body (4,2), (3,2)\n\nHead direction R.\n\nTurn 5: from (5,2), can go U, D, R.\n\nR to (6,2) is possible, no food, or U to (5,3), or D to (5,1).\n\nI should go towards (3,5).\n\nSo go U to (5,3), no food.\n\nPositions: head (5,3), body (5,2), (4,2) -- tail (3,2) removed, so [(5,3),(5,2),(4,2)]\n\nHead direction U.\n\nTurn 6: from (5,3), head dir U, can go U to (5,4), L to (4,3), R to (6,3).\n\nGo L to (4,3), no food.\n\nPositions: head (4,3), body (5,3), (5,2) -- tail (4,2) removed, so [(4,3),(5,3),(5,2)]\n\nHead direction L.\n\nTurn 7: from (4,3), head dir L, can go U to (4,4), D to (4,2), L to (3,3), R to (5,3) body collision.\n\nGo U to (4,4), no food.\n\nPositions: head (4,4), body (4,3), (5,3) -- tail (5,2) removed, so [(4,4),(4,3),(5,3)]\n\nHead direction U.\n\nTurn 8: from (4,4), head dir U, can go U to (4,5), L to (3,4), R to (5,4).\n\nGo U to (4,5), no food.\n\nPositions: head (4,5), body (4,4), (4,3) -- tail (5,3) removed, so [(4,5),(4,4),(4,3)]\n\nHead direction U.\n\nTurn 9: from (4,5), head dir U, can go U to (4,6), but (4,6) is internal wall, invalid. L to (3,5), R to (5,5).\n\n(3,5) has food, so go L to (3,5), eat.\n\nPositions: new head (3,5), body (4,5), (4,4), (4,3) since grow, so [(3,5),(4,5),(4,4),(4,3)]\n\nHead direction L.\n\nThen I can continue to (6,5) later.\n\nFor the answer, I need to output actions for turn 4 to turn 8 or so, but the instruction says \"think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"answer format: turn t1: action, turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nProbably for a few turns, but since I need to think ahead, I can output for 5 turns.\n\nCurrent turn t1=4.\n\nSo actions for turn 4,5,6,7,8.\n\nFrom above:\n\nTurn 4: R\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: L\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nThen turn 9: L to eat, but turn 9 not in the output if I stop at turn 8.\n\nFor the plan, up to turn 8.\n\nBut in turn 8 I am at (4,5), and turn 9 I go L to (3,5).\n\nFor the answer, I can output up to turn 8 or more.\n\nThe format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but not specified how many, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", probably output for 5 turns or so.\n\nI can output for turns 4 to 8.\n\nIn this sequence, I eat at turn 4 and turn 9, but turn 9 not shown.\n\nBut the actions are for movement.\n\nAnother thing: in turn 7, I went U to (4,4), but from (4,3), I could go L to (3,3) directly to be closer to (3,5).\n\nIn turn 7, from (4,3) head dir L, I can go L to (3,3) instead of U.\n\nThen positions: go L to (3,3), no food, positions: head (3,3), body (4,3), (5,3) -- tail (5,2) removed, so [(3,3),(4,3),(5,3)]\n\nHead dir L.\n\nTurn 8: from (3,3) head dir L, can go U to (3,4), D to (3,2), L to (2,3).\n\nGo U to (3,4), no food, positions: head (3,4), body (3,3), (4,3) -- tail (5,3) removed, so [(3,4),(3,3),(4,3)]\n\nHead dir U.\n\nTurn 9: from (3,4) go U to (3,5), eat.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIn both cases, eat at turn 9.\n\nBut in the first sequence, I went up to (4,5) then left, which might be safer or something.\n\nBut no issue.\n\nFor the output, let's use the first sequence.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 4: R (to eat (5,2))\n\nTurn 5: U (to (5,3))\n\nTurn 6: L (to (4,3))\n\nTurn 7: U (to (4,4))\n\nTurn 8: U (to (4,5))\n\nThen turn 9: L to (3,5) eat, but not in output.\n\nSince I need to think ahead, but for the answer, output the actions for the turns.\n\nPerhaps I can include up to turn 9, but the current state is turn 4, so turns 4 to 8 is 5 turns.\n\nt1 to t1+4.\n\nTurn 4,5,6,7,8: 5 actions.\n\nIn this, I have a plan to eat (3,5) on turn 9.\n\nI could go for (1,2) but I think this is better.\n\nAnother option: at turn 4, go U to (4,3), then directly to (1,2) as before, but I miss (3,5) and (5,2), so only one food.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo I think eating (5,2) and then (3,5) is better.\n\nFor the tail reward danger: not applicable now.\n\nAnd internal wall at (4,6), I avoided it by not going up there.\n\nIn turn 8, I am at (4,5), and I go to (4,6) is invalid, so I go left.\n\nFine.\n\nSo actions for turn 4 to turn 8.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I evaluated the available food and their life spans, the snake's current position, and potential paths over the next 5+ turns. The key considerations are:\n- **Food life spans**: \n  - (1,2) disappears after turn 9 (life span 6 from turn 4).\n  - (3,5) disappears after turn 9 (life span 6 from turn 4).\n  - (5,2) disappears after turn 10 (life span 7 from turn 4).\n  - (6,5) disappears after turn 13 (life span 10 from turn 4).\n- **Immediate choice at turn 4**: The snake can move right to eat (5,2) for +1 score and growth, or move up/down to pursue other food. Eating (5,2) is efficient as it is adjacent and provides an immediate reward, enabling a path to (3,5) by turn 9 before it disappears. Missing (1,2) is unavoidable due to distance and life span constraints, but (6,5) can be targeted later.\n- **Path to (3,5)**: After eating (5,2), the snake moves up and left to reach (3,5) by turn 9. This path avoids walls, body collisions, and respects movement constraints (no instant reverse).\n- **Long-term survival**: After eating (3,5), the snake can target (6,5) for additional score. The grid has space to maneuver, and the snake remains short enough (length 3 after turn 4) to avoid dead ends.\n- **Risks avoided**: \n  - No food under the snake body.\n  - Tail reward danger not applicable (tail has no food).\n  - Wall at (4,6) is avoided by not moving up from (4,5).\n\n**Plan for turns 4 to 8 (5 turns ahead):**\n- **Turn 4**: Move right (R) to (5,2) to eat positive food (+1 score, snake grows to length 3).\n- **Turn 5**: Move up (U) to (5,3) to position for leftward movement toward (3,5).\n- **Turn 6**: Move left (L) to (4,3) to continue toward (3,5).\n- **Turn 7**: Move up (U) to (4,4) to avoid the internal wall at (4,6) and align vertically.\n- **Turn 8**: Move up (U) to (4,5) to set up for eating (3,5) on turn 9.\n\n**State after turn 8**:\n- Snake positions: [(4,5), (4,4), (4,3)] (head at (4,5), direction up).\n- Food remaining: (3,5) can be eaten on turn 9 by moving left; (6,5) can be targeted afterward.\n\nThis plan secures two food items ((5,2) and (3,5)) by turn 9, maximizing score with minimal risk. Actions for turns beyond 8 can include moving left to (3,5) on turn 9, then toward (6,5).\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 4\\text{: R (right)} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 5\\text{: U (up)} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 6\\text{: L (left)} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7\\text{: U (up)} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8\\text{: U (up)}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 5, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls, so the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6? Let me confirm.\n\nThe walls are given as border cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (4,6). So the grid size is 8x8? x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, but borders are walls, so snake can only be in x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6, except for obstacles.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls. So the inner grid is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, that's 6x6 playable area, but with internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6). (4,6) – y=6 is the top border? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=7 is top or bottom? Typically in grids, y increases upwards or downwards? I need to clarify the coordinate system.\n\nThe movement: U is (x,y+1), so y increases upwards, I assume. D is (x,y-1), so down decreases y. So y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top wall. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nSo playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. But internal obstacle at (4,6). (4,6) – y=6 is the top row, but y=7 is wall, so y=6 is within playable? y=1 to y=6, since y=0 and y=7 are walls. y=0 is bottom wall, y=7 is top wall, so y from 1 to 6 are playable.\n\nSimilarly, x from 1 to 6.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6): (4,6) is within playable area, so it's blocked.\n\nSnake positions: [(5,2), (4,2), (3,2)] – head is (5,2), then body (4,2), tail (3,2). So the snake is horizontal at y=2, from x=3 to x=5.\n\nHead direction is R, right, so moving east.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (1,2) with value 1, life span 5\n\n- (3,5) with value 1, life span 5\n\n- (6,5) with value 1, life span 9\n\nAll food have value +1, so all positive food.\n\nLife span: for (1,2), life span 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n\nCurrent turn is t=5, so for food at (1,2), life span 5, it will disappear after turn 5 + (5-1) or something? Let's see.\n\nLife span N means it disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n\nSo at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after t + L - 1? Example: if a food appears at turn T with life span L, at turn T, countdown is L, it decreases to L-1 at T+1, ..., to 0 at T+L, and it disappears at that point? Or when countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nThe rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nI think it's better to think: at the start of turn t, if food has life span L, after this turn, it decreases by 1, so after L decreases, it disappears.\n\nStandard way: at turn t, food has remaining life span. When it says \"life_span\" in state, it's the current remaining life span.\n\nIn the input: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" – so at current turn t=5, life_span is given, so for (1,2), life_span=5, meaning it has 5 turns left including this one, so it will disappear after turn 5 + 4? Let's clarify.\n\nIf life_span is N at turn t, then after N turns, it disappears. Since countdown decreases each turn, including current.\n\nAt turn t, before the move, food has life_span L. After the turn, if not eaten, life_span becomes L-1. When life_span reaches 0, it disappears, so it's present until life_span is 1, and after turn when it decreases to 0, it's gone.\n\nFor example, if L=1 at turn t, it will disappear after this turn, so snake can eat it on turn t if it moves there.\n\nIf L=2 at turn t, it will be there at turn t and t+1, disappear after t+1.\n\nIn this case, at turn 5:\n\n- Food at (1,2): life_span=5, so it will be there for turns 5,6,7,8,9? Life span 5 means it has 5 turns left, so from turn 5 to turn 9? Let's calculate.\n\nLife span N at turn t means it will disappear after N more turns. Since it decreases each turn, including current.\n\nAt turn t, life_span=N, after turn t, it becomes N-1, so it is present for N turns starting from this turn.\n\nFor N=5 at t=5, it is present from turn 5 to turn 9? Turn t to t+N-1.\n\nExample: if N=1 at t=5, it is present only on turn 5, disappears after turn 5.\n\nIf N=2, present on turn 5 and 6, disappears after turn 6.\n\nSo for N=5 at t=5, it is present from turn 5 to turn 9 (5 turns: 5,6,7,8,9), disappears after turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5): life_span=5, same, present turns 5 to 9.\n\n(6,5): life_span=9, so present turns 5 to 13.\n\nAll food is positive, value +1.\n\nNow, snake head at (5,2), direction R (right). So possible moves: since head direction is R, I can move U (up), D (down), R (right), but not L (left) because that would be instant reverse. Rule: no instant reverse, cannot move opposite to current direction.\n\nCurrent direction is R, so cannot move L. Possible moves: U, D, R.\n\nNow, grid: playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, with wall at (4,6) which is internal obstacle, so (4,6) is blocked.\n\nAlso, borders are walls, so x=0,7 and y=0,7 are out of bounds.\n\nSnake body: positions [(5,2), (4,2), (3,2)], so cells occupied: (5,2) head, (4,2) body, (3,2) tail.\n\nFood at (1,2), which is on the same row y=2, x=1.\n\n(1,2) has food, but snake is at (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), so (1,2) is not occupied by snake, it's free.\n\nFood can spawn under body, but in this case, (1,2) is not under snake, it's empty.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) and (6,5) are elsewhere.\n\nI need to plan moves for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score and avoid risks.\n\nFirst, let's list possible actions for current turn.\n\nCurrent head: (5,2), direction R.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: to (5,3)\n\n- D: to (5,1)\n\n- R: to (6,2)\n\nNow, check if these are safe.\n\n(5,3): is it within bounds? x=5 between 1-6, y=3 between 1-6? y=1 to 6, y=3 is fine. Is there wall? Border walls only at y=0,7, so no. Internal obstacle at (4,6), not here. Snake body: currently snake is at (5,2),(4,2),(3,2), so (5,3) is empty, so safe to move to? But after moving, the snake will have new head position, and body follows.\n\nWhen moving to a cell, if it's not wall and not occupied by body except tail, it's ok. Tail is special because when head moves, tail moves, so if head moves to tail position, it's ok because tail moves away.\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nIn this case, tail is at (3,2). If I move left to (4,2)? But I cannot move left, direction is R, cannot reverse.\n\nFor (5,3): not occupied by body, not wall, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1): y=1, which is not wall (y=0 is wall, y=1 is playable), no body, so safe.\n\n(6,2): x=6, which is not x=7, so playable, no body, safe.\n\nNow, also need to consider food.\n\nFood at (1,2), (3,5), (6,5).\n\n(6,5) is food, which is at x=6,y=5.\n\nIf I move R to (6,2), that's not food, just empty cell.\n\nBut (6,5) is above.\n\nI need to think ahead.\n\nSince I need to maximize score, I should aim to eat food, but avoid risks.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut in this case, tail is at (3,2), and there is food at (1,2), but not on tail, it's separate.\n\nTail has no food, it's just a body segment.\n\nThe food is at (1,2), which is not under snake.\n\nNow, let's think about the grid.\n\nVisualize grid:\n\ny=6: top, walls at y=7, but y=6 is playable except (4,6) obstacle.\n\ny=5: playable\n\ny=4: playable\n\ny=3: playable\n\ny=2: snake from x=3 to 5, food at (1,2)\n\ny=1: playable\n\ny=0: wall\n\nx from 1 to 6.\n\nFood at (1,2), (3,5), (6,5)\n\n(3,5) is at x=3,y=5, which is not occupied.\n\n(6,5) at x=6,y=5.\n\nSnake head at (5,2), moving right.\n\nI should consider paths to food.\n\nFirst, food at (1,2) is on the same row, but to the left. Since I'm facing right, I need to turn around to get there.\n\nBut life span 5, so it will be there for turns 5,6,7,8,9. Plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) life span 5, turns 5-9.\n\n(6,5) life span 9, turns 5-13.\n\nNow, possible immediate moves: U, D, R.\n\nIf I move R to (6,2), then head at (6,2), direction now R (since I moved right).\n\nThen snake positions: head (6,2), body (5,2), tail (4,2)? Original positions: [(5,2), (4,2), (3,2)], after move R, head moves to (6,2), body segments follow: the first body segment moves to where head was, (5,2), and the tail moves to where the first body was, (4,2), so new positions: [(6,2), (5,2), (4,2)].\n\nTail at (4,2).\n\nThen on next turn, from (6,2), direction R, but x=6 is the right border, x=7 is wall, so if I move R, to (7,2), which is wall, collision, die.\n\nSo from (6,2), moving R is invalid, wall.\n\nPossible moves from (6,2): U to (6,3), D to (6,1), L to (5,2).\n\nBut L is left, which is opposite to current direction R, so cannot move L, instant reverse not allowed.\n\nCurrent direction after moving R is R, so cannot move L.\n\nSo from (6,2), possible moves: U or D, not R or L.\n\nIf I move U to (6,3), or D to (6,1).\n\nNow, (6,1) is playable, y=1 not wall.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) playable.\n\nBut at (6,2), I'm at the edge.\n\nIf I move R now to (6,2), I might get stuck or have limited moves.\n\nBut there is food at (6,5), which is above, at same x=6, y=5.\n\nSo from (6,2), I can move up to (6,3), then (6,4), then (6,5) to eat food on turn 7 or something.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nTurn 5: move R to (6,2)\n\nAfter move: positions [(6,2), (5,2), (4,2)], head dir R.\n\nTurn 6: from (6,2), dir R, possible moves: U to (6,3) or D to (6,1). Cannot R or L.\n\nSay move U to (6,3)\n\nNew positions: [(6,3), (6,2), (5,2)], head dir U (since moved up).\n\nTurn 7: from (6,3), dir U, possible moves: U to (6,4), D to (6,2), L to (5,3), R not possible since x=6, R would be (7,3) wall.\n\nCannot move D because opposite? Current dir U, D is down, opposite to U, so cannot move D, instant reverse not allowed.\n\nRule: no instant reverse, cannot move opposite to current direction.\n\nSo from (6,3) dir U, possible moves: U to (6,4), L to (5,3), or R? R to (7,3) wall, invalid. D to (6,2) but opposite to U, so cannot.\n\nSo only U or L.\n\nMove U to (6,4): positions [(6,4), (6,3), (6,2)], head dir U.\n\nTurn 8: from (6,4) dir U, move U to (6,5), which has food! (6,5) has food with value 1.\n\nMove to (6,5), eat food, snake grows, so new positions: head (6,5), then since ate, add a segment, so body: (6,4), (6,3), and tail (6,2)? Let's see.\n\nBefore move, positions: [(6,4), (6,3), (6,2)] with head at (6,4), tail at (6,2).\n\nAfter move to (6,5), head moves to (6,5), and since ate food, the tail doesn't move, so body segments: the first body moves to where head was (6,4), but since ate, we add a new segment at the tail position or? Standard snake growth: when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail stays in place for this turn.\n\nRule: when eating positive food, length +1, so snake grows.\n\nSo positions: before move, snake at S0, S1, S2, ..., Sn where S0 head, Sn tail.\n\nAfter move to a cell with food, new head at food cell, and new tail is not removed, so positions: [new_head, S0, S1, ..., Sn] so length increases by one.\n\nIn this case, before move to (6,5): positions [(6,4), (6,3), (6,2)] so head (6,4), body (6,3), tail (6,2).\n\nAfter moving to (6,5) and eating, new positions: head (6,5), then the previous head (6,4) becomes first body, then (6,3) becomes second body, and tail (6,2) remains, but since length increases, a new segment is added? No.\n\nWhen snake eats, it grows: so the head moves to the new position, and the tail does not move, so the segment that was tail stays, and a new segment is effectively added at the tail.\n\nPositions: new head at food cell, followed by all previous segments, so the list becomes [new_head, old_head, old_body1, ..., old_tail] so length n+1.\n\nIn this case, from [(6,4), (6,3), (6,2)] move to (6,5), new positions: [(6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)] so now length 4, head at (6,5), tail at (6,2).\n\nYes.\n\nThen head direction is U.\n\nNow, at (6,5), which is top-right, x=6,y=5.\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,6), but y=6, playable? y=6 is playable, since y=7 wall. But there is internal obstacle at (4,6), not at (6,6).\n\n(6,6) is free? Let's see.\n\nGrid: y=6 is playable except (4,6) is obstacle, so (6,6) is free.\n\nD to (6,4), but current dir U, D is opposite, cannot.\n\nL to (5,5), R invalid (wall).\n\nSo only U or L.\n\nMove U to (6,6): positions [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)]? After eating, positions [(6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)], then move U to (6,6): head to (6,6), tail moves to (6,3)? When moving without eating, tail moves.\n\nAfter eating on turn 8, positions: [(6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)]\n\nTurn 9: move to (6,6), no food there, so head to (6,6), body follows: first body to (6,5), second to (6,4), tail to (6,3), so new positions [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)], tail at (6,3).\n\nThen at (6,6), dir U, possible moves: U to (6,7) wall, invalid; D to (6,5) opposite, cannot; L to (5,6); R invalid.\n\nSo only L to (5,6).\n\nThen move to (5,6), and so on.\n\nBut this is one path.\n\nBack to turn 5.\n\nIf I move R to (6,2), I can go up to eat (6,5) by turn 8 or so.\n\nBut on turn 5, I didn't eat food yet.\n\nIn this sequence, I ate on turn 8.\n\nBut there is also food at (1,2) and (3,5).\n\n(1,2) is on the left, same y=2.\n\nIf I want to eat (1,2), I need to go left, but currently at (5,2), direction R, so I cannot move left immediately.\n\nI need to turn around.\n\nFor example, move U or D first.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) at x=3,y=5.\n\nNow, life spans: (1,2) and (3,5) both life span 5, so disappear after turn 9? Present until turn 9.\n\n(6,5) life span 9, until turn 13.\n\nSo I have time for all.\n\nBut I need to think about risks.\n\nAnother thing: the grid has limited space, snake is small now, length 3.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: but not applicable now.\n\nNow, let's consider other moves from turn 5.\n\nInstead of moving R, I could move U to (5,3).\n\nThen head to (5,3), direction U (since moved up).\n\nNew positions: [(5,3), (5,2), (4,2)], tail at (4,2)? Original [(5,2),(4,2),(3,2)], move U to (5,3), so new head (5,3), body (5,2), tail (4,2), and (3,2) is left, tail moved to (4,2).\n\nPositions: [(5,3), (5,2), (4,2)]\n\nThen from (5,3), dir U, possible moves: U to (5,4), D to (5,2) but (5,2) is body, not tail, and D opposite to U, cannot move D.\n\nL to (4,3), R to (6,3).\n\nCannot move D because opposite and occupied? But (5,2) is occupied by body, so moving D to (5,2) would be body collision, except if it were tail, but here (5,2) is not tail, it's the first body segment.\n\nTail is at (4,2).\n\n(5,2) is body, so moving to (5,2) is collision.\n\nBut since D is opposite, it's invalid anyway.\n\nSo possible: U to (5,4), L to (4,3), R to (6,3).\n\nAll should be safe, assuming no walls or obstacles.\n\n(5,4) free, (4,3) free, (6,3) free.\n\nSimilarly, if I move D to (5,1) on turn 5.\n\nTo (5,1), dir D (down).\n\nThen positions [(5,1), (5,2), (4,2)]\n\nFrom (5,1), dir D, possible moves: D to (5,0) wall, invalid; U to (5,2) opposite and occupied, cannot; L to (4,1), R to (6,1).\n\nSo only L or R.\n\nNow, I need to think about getting food.\n\nFood at (1,2): to eat it, I need to get to (1,2).\n\nFrom current position (5,2), I could move left, but cannot, direction R, no reverse.\n\nSo I need to go up or down or right, then turn around.\n\nFor example, if I move U to (5,3), then I can go left to (4,3), then to (3,3), then down to (3,2), but (3,2) is where the body was, but after moves, it might be free.\n\nLet's simulate a path to (1,2).\n\nSuppose turn 5: move U to (5,3)  // now at (5,3)\n\nTurn 6: from (5,3) dir U, move L to (4,3)  // now head (4,3), dir L (left)\n\nNew positions: after turn 5: [(5,3),(5,2),(4,2)]\n\nMove L to (4,3): head to (4,3), body to (5,3), tail to (5,2)? Positions: [(4,3), (5,3), (5,2)]\n\nTail at (5,2).\n\nTurn 7: from (4,3) dir L, possible moves: L to (3,3), R to (5,3) but (5,3) is body, not tail, and R opposite to L, cannot; U to (4,4), D to (4,2).\n\n(4,2) is free now? Previously occupied, but after moves, it should be free.\n\nAt turn 6 positions: head (4,3), body (5,3), tail (5,2)\n\n(4,2) is empty.\n\nD to (4,2) is possible.\n\nBut let's go towards (1,2).\n\nMove L to (3,3): head to (3,3), body to (4,3), tail to (5,3)? Positions: [(3,3), (4,3), (5,3)]? After move from (4,3) to (3,3): head (3,3), followed by previous head (4,3), then previous body (5,3), but previous body was (5,3), and tail was (5,2), which is left behind.\n\nPrevious positions: [(4,3), (5,3), (5,2)]\n\nMove to (3,3): head to (3,3), then first body to where head was (4,3), then second body to where first body was (5,3), so positions [(3,3), (4,3), (5,3)], tail at (5,3).\n\n(5,2) is now empty.\n\nNow at (3,3), dir L.\n\nTurn 8: from (3,3) dir L, move D to (3,2)  // since (3,2) is below, and (3,2) has no food? Food is at (1,2), not (3,2).\n\n(3,2) was tail long ago, now free.\n\nMove D to (3,2): head to (3,2), body to (3,3), tail to (4,3)? Positions: [(3,2), (3,3), (4,3)]\n\nNow at (3,2), which is left of head, but food at (1,2) further left.\n\nFrom (3,2), dir? After moving D, direction is D.\n\nTurn 9: from (3,2) dir D, move L to (2,2)  // possible, since dir D, L is not opposite, so can move L.\n\nCurrent dir D, moving L (left), not opposite to D? Directions: U and D are vertical, L and R horizontal, so moving left from down is not opposite; opposite would be U.\n\nSo can move L to (2,2): head to (2,2), body to (3,2), tail to (3,3)\n\nPositions: [(2,2), (3,2), (3,3)]\n\nTurn 10: from (2,2) dir L (since moved left), move L to (1,2), which has food! Eat it.\n\nSo on turn 10, eat (1,2).\n\nBut life span of (1,2) is 5 at turn 5, so it disappears after turn 9? At turn 5, life span 5, so present turns 5,6,7,8,9. Disappears after turn 9, so on turn 10, it's gone.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt turn 5, life span 5: it is present for turns 5,6,7,8,9. After turn 9, it disappears, so on turn 10, not there.\n\nIn my sequence, I reach (1,2) on turn 10, which is too late.\n\nTurn 9: at (2,2), but (1,2) is adjacent, but I need to move to it.\n\nOn turn 9, if I am at (2,2), I can move to (1,2) if food is still there.\n\nAt turn 9, is (1,2) still present?\n\nLife span: at turn 5, life span 5. After each turn, life span decreases.\n\nAt start of turn 5, life span 5.\n\nAfter turn 5, if not eaten, life span becomes 4.\n\nAfter turn 6, 3, and so on, down to 0 after turn 9, so it disappears after turn 9, meaning not present on turn 10.\n\nIt is present at the start of turn 5 to turn 9.\n\nOn turn 9, it is still present, with life span 1? Let's track.\n\nAt turn t=5, life span=5. Before move, food present.\n\nAfter snake move, if head moves to food, eat it, else life span decreases by 1.\n\nAfter turn 5, if not eaten, life span=4.\n\nAt start of turn 6, life span=4.\n\nAfter turn 6, if not eaten, life span=3.\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 8, if not eaten, life span=1 at start of turn 9.\n\nAfter turn 9, if not eaten, life span=0, disappears.\n\nSo food is present and can be eaten on turn 9 if life span >=1 at start of turn.\n\nOn turn 9, life span=1, so if head moves to it on turn 9, it can be eaten.\n\nIn my sequence, on turn 9, I am at (2,2), and I move to (1,2) on turn 9, so I can eat it on turn 9.\n\nTurn 9: from (2,2) move L to (1,2), eat food.\n\nYes, just in time.\n\nSimilarly for other food.\n\nBut in this path, I ate on turn 9.\n\nNow, back to the food at (6,5), I could eat earlier.\n\nIn the first path, if I go right and up, I can eat (6,5) on turn 8.\n\nTurn 5: move R to (6,2)\n\nTurn 6: move U to (6,3)\n\nTurn 7: move U to (6,4)\n\nTurn 8: move U to (6,5) eat\n\nSo eat on turn 8.\n\n(6,5) has life span 9, plenty.\n\n(3,5) is at x=3,y=5, life span 5, present until turn 9.\n\nI could go for (3,5) directly.\n\nFrom current position (5,2), move U to (5,3) on turn 5.\n\nThen turn 6: move L to (4,3) or U to (5,4), etc.\n\nTo (3,5): from (5,3), move U to (5,4) turn 6.\n\nThen turn 7: move L to (4,4) or U to (5,5), etc.\n\n(3,5) is at y=5.\n\nSo from (5,4), move L to (4,4) turn 7.\n\nTurn 8: move L to (3,4) or U to (4,5), etc.\n\nThen to (3,5): from (3,4) move U to (3,5) or from (4,5) move L to (3,5).\n\nBut need to reach by turn 9.\n\nAlso, there is internal obstacle at (4,6), which might affect paths.\n\nBut (4,6) is at y=6, not directly in the way for (3,5).\n\nNow, I need to consider which food to prioritize.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should consider the sequence that allows me to eat multiple food safely.\n\nAlso, avoid dead ends.\n\nFor example, if I move R to (6,2), I am at the border, and to eat (6,5), I need to go up, but after eating, I might be trapped at the top-right corner.\n\nAs in earlier, after eating (6,5) on turn 8, positions [(6,5),(6,4),(6,3),(6,2)], then I can only move U to (6,6) or L to (5,5).\n\nIf I move U to (6,6), then from there, only L to (5,6), then from (5,6), I can move L to (4,6) but (4,6) is obstacle! Wall.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), so (4,6) is blocked.\n\nSo from (5,6), possible moves: D to (5,5), U to (5,7) wall, L to (4,6) obstacle, R to (6,6) but (6,6) is previous, occupied? After moving to (5,6), positions depend.\n\nAfter turn 8: ate (6,5), positions [(6,5),(6,4),(6,3),(6,2)]\n\nTurn 9: move U to (6,6), no food, so positions: head (6,6), body (6,5), (6,4), (6,3) — tail at (6,3)\n\nNow at (6,6), dir U, as before, only possible move L to (5,6)\n\nMove to (5,6): head to (5,6), body to (6,6), (6,5), (6,4) — positions [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4)]\n\nTail at (6,4)\n\nNow at (5,6), dir? After moving L from (6,6), direction L (left).\n\nNow possible moves: from (5,6) dir L, move D to (5,5), or U to (5,7) wall, or L to (4,6) obstacle, or R to (6,6) but (6,6) is body, occupied.\n\nSo only possible move D to (5,5).\n\nMove to (5,5): head to (5,5), body to (5,6), (6,6), (6,5) — positions [(5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5)]\n\nNow at (5,5), I can move to other areas.\n\nBut this is manageable.\n\nSimilarly, if I go for other food.\n\nNow, back to turn 5, I have three choices.\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead? The answer format is to provide actions for turns starting from t1=5, for several turns.\n\nThe instruction: \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the output should be a sequence of actions for the next few turns, I think.\n\nAnswer format: boxed with actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nHow many turns? It doesn't specify, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide a sequence of at least 5 turns? Or plan for 5 turns in the future.\n\nI think I need to output a sequence of actions starting from current turn for several turns.\n\nBut it might be open-ended; I should provide a sequence until I eat food or something.\n\nBut to be practical, I'll plan for 5 turns or so.\n\nSince the grid is small, I can plan a path.\n\nNow, another food at (3,5), which I can reach.\n\nFor example, from (5,2), move U to (5,3) on turn 5.\n\nThen turn 6: move U to (5,4)  // dir U\n\nTurn 7: move L to (4,4)  // from (5,4) dir U, move L to (4,4), dir L\n\nTurn 8: move U to (4,5)  // from (4,4) dir L, move U to (4,5), dir U\n\nTurn 9: move L to (3,5) eat food at (3,5)  // from (4,5) dir U, move L to (3,5), eat.\n\n(3,5) life span 5, present turn 5-9, so on turn 9, can eat.\n\nSimilarly, I could go directly.\n\nBut from turn 5, if I move R to (6,2), I can eat (6,5) on turn 8.\n\nThen I have an extra turn.\n\nBut (6,5) has longer life, but all give same score.\n\nNow, the food at (1,2) is closer in terms of manhattan distance, but due to movement constraints, it takes more turns to reach because I need to turn around.\n\nFrom (5,2) to (1,2) is 4 units left, but I can't go left directly.\n\nIn my earlier path, I reached on turn 9 with 4 moves: U,L,L,D or something.\n\nIn the path to (1,2): turn 5 U to (5,3), turn 6 L to (4,3), turn 7 L to (3,3), turn 8 D to (3,2), turn 9 L to (2,2)? Then turn 10 L to (1,2), but on turn 10 it's gone.\n\nMistake.\n\nFrom (3,3) on turn 7, instead of D to (3,2), I can go directly left if possible.\n\nFrom (3,3) dir L, on turn 7, I can move L to (2,3)? Let's correct.\n\nTurn 5: move U to (5,3)  // positions [(5,3),(5,2),(4,2)]\n\nTurn 6: from (5,3) dir U, move L to (4,3)  // positions [(4,3),(5,3),(5,2)]  dir L\n\nTurn 7: from (4,3) dir L, move L to (3,3)  // positions [(3,3),(4,3),(5,3)]  dir L\n\nTurn 8: from (3,3) dir L, move D to (3,2)  // positions [(3,2),(3,3),(4,3)]  dir D\n\nTurn 9: from (3,2) dir D, move L to (2,2)  // positions [(2,2),(3,2),(3,3)]  dir L\n\nBut (1,2) is at (1,2), so from (2,2) I need to move L to (1,2) on turn 10, but on turn 10, food gone.\n\nOn turn 8, at (3,3), instead of moving D, I can move L to (2,3) or U to (3,4), but not directly to (3,2) without moving D.\n\nFrom (3,3), to reach (1,2), I need to go left and down.\n\nBut (1,2) is at y=2, x=1.\n\nFrom (3,3), move D to (3,2) on turn 8, then on turn 9, from (3,2) move L to (2,2), but (1,2) is not reached.\n\nFrom (2,2) to (1,2) is one move left.\n\nBut on turn 9, I am at (2,2), and I move to (1,2) on turn 9? On turn 9, from (2,2), I can move to (1,2) if I am there at start of turn.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAfter turn 8: at (3,2)\n\nTurn 9: from (3,2) dir D, move L to (2,2)  // now at (2,2), dir L\n\nThen on turn 9, I am at (2,2), and food at (1,2) is still present? At start of turn 9, life span of (1,2) is 1 (since decreased each turn), so present. If I move to (1,2) on turn 9, I can eat it.\n\nBut in this move, on turn 9, I moved to (2,2), not to (1,2).\n\nFrom (3,2) on turn 8, I moved to (3,2) at end of turn 8, then turn 9 I start at (3,2), and I move to (2,2) or to (1,2)?\n\nFrom (3,2), I can move directly to (2,2) or to (1,2)? No, only adjacent cells.\n\nPossible moves from (3,2) dir D: since dir D, can move L to (2,2), R to (4,2), U to (3,3), D to (3,1).\n\nNot directly to (1,2).\n\nSo I need to go to (2,2) first, then to (1,2) on next turn.\n\nBut on turn 10, food gone.\n\nTo eat on turn 9, I need to be at (1,2) or adjacent to move to it on turn 9.\n\nFor example, on turn 9, if I am at (2,2) or (1,1) or (1,3), I can move to (1,2).\n\nBut in my current path, on turn 9 I am at (2,2) only if I moved there on turn 9, but on turn 9 I start from (3,2) and move to (2,2), so at end of turn 9 I am at (2,2), and food disappears after turn 9.\n\nAt start of turn 9, food is present; during turn 9, I move, if I move to (1,2), I eat it.\n\nBut from (3,2), I cannot move directly to (1,2); I have to move to adjacent cell.\n\nSo on turn 9, from (3,2), the closest I can get is (2,2), not (1,2).\n\nThen on turn 10, from (2,2), I can move to (1,2), but food gone.\n\nSo I cannot eat (1,2) in this way; it's too late.\n\nI need a different path to reach (1,2) earlier.\n\nFor example, from turn 5, move D to (5,1) instead.\n\nTurn 5: move D to (5,1)  // positions [(5,1),(5,2),(4,2)]  dir D\n\nTurn 6: from (5,1) dir D, move L to (4,1)  // since cannot U or D easily, move L to (4,1)  positions [(4,1),(5,1),(5,2)]  dir L\n\nTurn 7: from (4,1) dir L, move L to (3,1)  // positions [(3,1),(4,1),(5,1)]  dir L\n\nTurn 8: from (3,1) dir L, move U to (3,2)  // positions [(3,2),(3,1),(4,1)]  dir U\n\nTurn 9: from (3,2) dir U, move L to (2,2) or to (1,2)? Can move L to (2,2) or U to (3,3), etc. To (1,2), need to move west.\n\nFrom (3,2) dir U, move L to (2,2)  // positions [(2,2),(3,2),(3,1)]\n\nThen turn 10 move to (1,2), too late.\n\nFrom (3,2) on turn 8, I am at (3,2), and (1,2) is two cells left, but I need two moves: to (2,2) then (1,2), but on turn 9 and 10.\n\nOn turn 9, I can be at (2,2), but not at (1,2) to eat.\n\nUnless I am at (1,1) or (1,3) on turn 9 and move to (1,2).\n\nFor example, from turn 8 at (3,2), move U to (3,3) instead.\n\nBut that doesn't help.\n\nPerhaps from the beginning, move towards left immediately.\n\nBut I can't move left from (5,2) with dir R.\n\nSo the only way to reach (1,2) by turn 9 is to be adjacent on turn 8 or something.\n\nMinimum turns to reach (1,2) from (5,2):\n\nFrom (5,2) to (1,2) is 4 units left, but with movement constraints.\n\nIf I could move left directly, 4 moves, but I can't.\n\nSo I need to detour.\n\nShortest path: for example, move U to (5,3), then L to (4,3), L to (3,3), L to (2,3), D to (2,2), L to (1,2) — that's 6 moves, turn 10 or 11.\n\nTurn 5 start at (5,2), after move U to (5,3) end turn 5.\n\nTurn 6 move L to (4,3)\n\nTurn 7 move L to (3,3)\n\nTurn 8 move L to (2,3)\n\nTurn 9 move D to (2,2)\n\nTurn 10 move L to (1,2) — but food gone on turn 10.\n\nIf I go down: move D to (5,1), L to (4,1), L to (3,1), L to (2,1), U to (2,2), L to (1,2) — same thing, turn 10.\n\nOr directly from (2,1) to (1,1) then to (1,2), but longer.\n\nSo I cannot reach (1,2) by turn 9; the latest I can eat is turn 9, but I can only reach on turn 10 at best.\n\nSince it disappears after turn 9, I cannot eat (1,2) at all? On turn 9, if I am at (1,1) or (1,3) or (2,2), I can move to (1,2) on turn 9.\n\nFor example, on turn 9, if I am at (2,2), I can move L to (1,2) and eat.\n\nBut to be at (2,2) on turn 9.\n\nFrom current position, how to be at (2,2) on turn 9.\n\nTurn 5: from (5,2), move D to (5,1)  // at (5,1) end turn 5\n\nTurn 6: move L to (4,1)  // at (4,1)\n\nTurn 7: move L to (3,1)  // at (3,1)\n\nTurn 8: move L to (2,1)  // at (2,1)\n\nTurn 9: from (2,1), move U to (2,2) or L to (1,1), etc. If I move U to (2,2), I am at (2,2) on turn 9, but I need to move to (1,2) to eat, which is on turn 10.\n\nOn turn 9, I start at (2,1), and I move to (2,2), so at the end of move, I am at (2,2), but to eat (1,2), I need to be on (1,2) during a turn.\n\nOn turn 9, if I move directly to (1,2) from where I am.\n\nBut from (2,1), I can move L to (1,1) or U to (2,2), not directly to (1,2) because not adjacent diagonally.\n\nOnly orthogonal moves.\n\nSo from (2,1), I can move to (1,1), (3,1), (2,2), (2,0) invalid.\n\nNot to (1,2).\n\nSimilarly, from (1,1) I can move to (1,2) on turn 10.\n\nBut turn 10 too late.\n\nSo it is impossible to eat the food at (1,2) because it disappears after turn 9, and I can only reach it on turn 10 at the earliest.\n\nSimilarly for (3,5), I can reach by turn 9.\n\nFor example, from (5,2), move U to (5,3) turn 5.\n\nTurn 6: move U to (5,4)\n\nTurn 7: move L to (4,4)\n\nTurn 8: move U to (4,5)\n\nTurn 9: move L to (3,5) eat.\n\nYes, on turn 9.\n\n(4,5) to (3,5) is left, adjacent.\n\nAnd (3,5) present on turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, for (6,5), I can eat on turn 8 as before.\n\nSo (1,2) cannot be eaten, so I should ignore it.\n\nFocus on (3,5) or (6,5).\n\n(3,5) life span 5, must eat by turn 9.\n\n(6,5) life span 9, can eat later.\n\nBut both give +1.\n\nNow, the internal obstacle at (4,6) might affect paths in the top row.\n\nSince the grid is small, I should eat one and then the other.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger not an issue now.\n\nSo for turn 5, I can choose to go towards (3,5) or (6,5).\n\nIf I go towards (6,5), I eat on turn 8, then I can go to (3,5) but (3,5) disappears after turn 9, so from (6,5) on turn 8, to (3,5) by turn 9.\n\n(6,5) to (3,5) is distance |6-3| + |5-5| = 3 units, so minimum 3 moves.\n\nTurn 8 at (6,5), turn 9 move to say (5,5), turn 10 to (4,5), turn 11 to (3,5), but (3,5) gone after turn 9, so cannot eat on turn 11.\n\nOn turn 9, from (6,5), I can move L to (5,5), but (3,5) is at (3,5), not adjacent.\n\nTo be at (3,5) on turn 9, I need to be there or adjacent on turn 8.\n\nBut on turn 8, I am at (6,5) if I ate (6,5) on turn 8, so far away.\n\nIf I go for (3,5) first, I can eat on turn 9, then go to (6,5) later.\n\n(6,5) life span 9, present until turn 13, so after turn 9, I can go to (6,5).\n\nFor example, after eating (3,5) on turn 9, I am at (3,5), then I can move to (4,5), (5,5), (6,5) by turn 12, and eat.\n\nLife span 9 at turn 5, so at turn 12, life span? At turn 5:9, turn 6:8, ..., turn 12:9-7=2? Let's calculate remaining life.\n\nAt turn t=5, life span=9.\n\nAfter turn 5, if not eaten, life span=8 at start turn 6.\n\n...\n\nAt start turn 12, life span = 9 - (12-5) = 9-7=2, so present, can be eaten on turn 12.\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat (6,5) first on turn 8, I cannot eat (3,5) because it's gone.\n\n(3,5) must be eaten by turn 9.\n\nSo to maximize score, I should eat both, so I need to eat (3,5) first by turn 9, then (6,5) later.\n\n(1,2) cannot be eaten, so ignore.\n\nSo plan: go to (3,5) by turn 9.\n\nFrom current (5,2), head dir R.\n\nMove U to (5,3) on turn 5.\n\nThen as before:\n\nTurn 5: move U to (5,3)  // positions [(5,3),(5,2),(4,2)] dir U\n\nTurn 6: from (5,3) dir U, move U to (5,4)  // positions [(5,4),(5,3),(5,2)] dir U\n\nTurn 7: from (5,4) dir U, move L to (4,4)  // positions [(4,4),(5,4),(5,3)] dir L\n\nTurn 8: from (4,4) dir L, move U to (4,5)  // positions [(4,5),(4,4),(5,4)] dir U\n\nTurn 9: from (4,5) dir U, move L to (3,5)  // eat food, positions [(3,5),(4,5),(4,4)] and since ate, new segment, so [(3,5),(4,5),(4,4),(5,4)]? After move to (3,5) and eat, new head (3,5), followed by old head (4,5), old body (4,4), old tail (5,4), but old tail was (5,4), so positions [(3,5),(4,5),(4,4),(5,4)] length 4.\n\nNow, I have eaten (3,5).\n\nThen I can go to (6,5).\n\nFrom (3,5), dir L (since moved left).\n\nTurn 10: move R to (4,5) but (4,5) is body, occupied; cannot move to body except tail.\n\nCurrent positions: head (3,5), body (4,5), (4,4), tail (5,4)\n\n(4,5) is occupied by body, so moving to (4,5) is collision.\n\nPossible moves from (3,5) dir L: U to (3,6), D to (3,4), R to (4,5) occupied, L to (2,5).\n\nL to (2,5) or U to (3,6) or D to (3,4).\n\n(3,6) y=6, playable, no obstacle.\n\n(2,5) x=2, playable.\n\n(3,4) playable.\n\nSay move R not possible, so move U to (3,6) or D or L.\n\nTo go to (6,5), I need to go right.\n\nSo move D to (3,4) for example.\n\nTurn 10: move D to (3,4)  // positions, no eat, so head to (3,4), body to (3,5), (4,5), tail to (4,4)? After move: head (3,4), followed by old head (3,5), then (4,5), then tail (4,4), so positions [(3,4),(3,5),(4,5),(4,4)]? Order: head (3,4), then previous positions: the segment that was at (3,5) moves to where head was? Standard: when moving without eating, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to previous position of the segment before it.\n\nPrevious positions: head (3,5), body (4,5), (4,4), tail (5,4)\n\nAfter move to (3,4): new head (3,4), then the first body segment moves to old head position (3,5), second body to old first body position (4,5), tail to old second body position (4,4). Since there are three body segments, tail moves to (4,4).\n\nPositions: [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4)]\n\nNow tail at (4,4).\n\nFrom (3,4), dir D (since moved down).\n\nTurn 11: move R to (4,4) but (4,4) is tail? Tail at (4,4), and head moving to it is ok, because tail will move.\n\nRule: can move to tail cell because tail moves away.\n\nSo move R to (4,4) — but (4,4) is current tail, so after move, head moves to (4,4), tail moves to new position, so no collision.\n\nMove to (4,4): head to (4,4), and since no food, tail moves, so positions: new head (4,4), first body to old head (3,4), second body to old first body (3,5), tail to old second body (4,5), so [(4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)]\n\nNow at (4,4), dir? After moving R, direction R (right).\n\nThen turn 12: move R to (5,4)  // positions [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5)]\n\nDir R\n\nTurn 13: move R to (6,4)  // positions [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4)]\n\nDir R\n\nTurn 14: move U to (6,5)  // eat food at (6,5), positions after: head (6,5), then (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), and since ate, tail stays or add segment? Grow: new head (6,5), followed by old head (6,4), then (5,4), (4,4), and add the old tail position? Positions: [(6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4)] and old tail was (3,4), but since ate, we keep it, so [(6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4)]? No.\n\nBefore move: positions [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4)] head (6,4), tail (3,4)\n\nMove to (6,5) with food, eat, so new head (6,5), then old head (6,4) becomes first body, (5,4) second body, (4,4) third body, and tail (3,4) remains, but since growth, we add a new segment at the end, so positions: [ (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4) ] length 5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I ate both food.\n\nBut this is later.\n\nFor the immediate actions, I need to output from turn 5 onwards.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 5, I move U to go towards (3,5).\n\nI could go directly.\n\nAnother option: from turn 5, move R to (6,2), then go up to (6,5) eat on turn 8, but then I miss (3,5), so only one food.\n\nBy going U first, I can get both.\n\nSo better to go for (3,5) first.\n\nNow, for the output, I need to provide actions for several turns.\n\nSay for turns 5 to 9 or 10.\n\nSince the AI should think ahead, but output a sequence.\n\nI think providing 5 turns is fine.\n\nSo for turn 5: move U\n\nThen turn 6: move U\n\nTurn 7: move L\n\nTurn 8: move U\n\nTurn 9: move L to eat (3,5)\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 8 I move to (4,5), then turn 9 to (3,5).\n\nIn the answer format, I need to specify the action for each turn.\n\nAlso, confirm the direction.\n\nIn turn 7, from (5,4) I move L to (4,4), which is left, and current dir was U, so moving left is allowed, not opposite.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nTo avoid the internal obstacle, but in this path, I don't go near (4,6).\n\nNow, for the sequence:\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: L\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: L\n\nThen I can continue, but for the output, I think this is sufficient.\n\nThe answer should be in a box.\n\nAlso, in the state, snake head direction after moves changes.\n\nBut I don't need to output direction, only actions.\n\nSo actions for turns starting from t1=5.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: L\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: L\n\nIn turn 9, I move L to (3,5) and eat.\n\nNow, I should include one more to show I eat.\n\nBut not necessary.\n\nSince I thought 5 turns ahead, this should be fine.\n\nTo be precise.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I will plan a sequence of moves that prioritizes eating the positive food at (3,5) by turn 9 (before it disappears) and then positions the snake to eat the food at (6,5) later, as the food at (1,2) cannot be reached by turn 9 and will disappear. The plan involves moving upwards and leftwards to reach (3,5) efficiently while avoiding walls, obstacles, and collisions.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Food Lifespans**: \n  - (1,2): Life span 5, present until turn 9 (disappears after turn 9). Cannot be reached by turn 9 due to movement constraints and distance.\n  - (3,5): Life span 5, present until turn 9. Must be eaten by turn 9.\n  - (6,5): Life span 9, present until turn 13. Can be eaten after turn 9.\n- **Snake Position and Direction**: \n  - Start at (5,2) with direction R (right). \n  - Cannot move left (opposite direction) on turn 5.\n- **Grid Constraints**: \n  - Playable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 (borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls).\n  - Internal obstacle at (4,6) blocks that cell.\n- **Path to (3,5)**: \n  - Manhattan distance from (5,2) to (3,5) is 3 units, but due to movement constraints, it takes 4 moves to reach an adjacent cell (e.g., (4,5)) by turn 8, then eat on turn 9.\n  - Sequence: Turn 5: U to (5,3); Turn 6: U to (5,4); Turn 7: L to (4,4); Turn 8: U to (4,5); Turn 9: L to (3,5) to eat.\n- **Avoiding Risks**: \n  - No collisions: Path avoids walls, obstacle, and body segments.\n  - After eating (3,5) on turn 9, the snake can head towards (6,5) for future turns.\n- **5+ Turn Lookahead**: \n  - Eating (3,5) on turn 9 scores +1 and increases length.\n  - (6,5) can be eaten around turn 12-14 with its longer lifespan.\n  - Ignoring (1,2) as it is unreachable in time.\n\n### Planned Move Sequence (Turns 5 to 9):\n- **Turn 5**: Move U (up) to (5,3). This starts the path towards (3,5) and avoids the right border where movement would be restricted.\n- **Turn 6**: Move U (up) to (5,4). Continues upward movement, positioning for a left turn.\n- **Turn 7**: Move L (left) to (4,4). Moves left towards x=3, avoiding the obstacle at (4,6) which is not in the path.\n- **Turn 8**: Move U (up) to (4,5). Positions adjacent to (3,5) for eating on the next turn.\n- **Turn 9**: Move L (left) to (3,5) to eat the food. This is just before the food disappears.\n\n### Why this sequence?\n- **Score Maximization**: Eats (3,5) for +1 score and avoids missing it. Sets up for eating (6,5) later.\n- **Survival Focus**: Path stays within bounds, avoids obstacles, and prevents collisions. No tail reward danger as tail has no food.\n- **Efficiency**: Reaches (3,5) in minimum turns given constraints. After turn 9, the snake can head right to eat (6,5) by turn 12-14.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: L \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: L\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 6, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (5,3), then body segments at (5,2) and (4,2). So the snake has three segments. Head direction is Up, which means it was moving upwards to get to (5,3) from (5,2) in the previous move.\n\nFood items:\n\n- At (1,2) with value 1 and life span 4. Since it's turn 6, and life span decreases every turn including current, so it will disappear after 4 more turns? Life span is given as 4, meaning it has 4 turns left including this one. So it disappears after turn 9? Let me clarify the life span.\n\nThe food has a life span N, and it decreases every turn, including the current turn. So for food at turn t, if life span is L, it will be there for L turns, from turn t to turn t+L-1, I think. Let's read carefully.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo at the start of turn t, if food has life span N, it will be present for this turn and the next N-1 turns? No.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\".\n\nI think it means that when food spawns, it has a countdown of N. Each turn, including the turn it spawns, the countdown decreases by 1. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or something.\n\nBut in the state, it's given with life_span, which is the current remaining life span.\n\nFor example, at turn 6, food at (1,2) has life_span=4, meaning it has 4 turns left including turn 6. So after turn 6, life_span becomes 3, and so on, until it reaches 0, and it disappears before turn when countdown=0? Let's define it properly.\n\nTypically, if life_span is given as N at turn t, it means the food will disappear after N more turns. So at the end of turn t+N-1, it is still there, but gone by turn t+N.\n\nSince countdown decreases every turn including current, at turn t, life_span=N, then after turn t, it becomes N-1 for turn t+1, and so on. When life_span=1, it is present during that turn, and disappears after that turn, so not available for the next turn.\n\nFor (1,2): life_span=4 at turn 6, so:\n\n- Turn 6: present, life_span=4\n\nAfter turn 6, before turn 7, life_span decreases to 3.\n\nTurn 7: present, life_span=3\n\nTurn 8: present, life_span=2\n\nTurn 9: present, life_span=1\n\nAfter turn 9, disappears, not present on turn 10.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\n(3,5) value 1, life_span=4 at turn 6, same as above.\n\n(6,5) value 1, life_span=8 at turn 6, so it lasts longer.\n\nAll food has value 1, positive, since value is 1 for all, and no negative food mentioned. Value=1 means +1, positive food.\n\nNow, the snake head is at (5,3), direction Up.\n\nPossible moves: Up, Down, Left, Right.\n\nBut cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is Up, so cannot move Down immediately, because that would be reverse.\n\nSo allowed moves: Up, Left, Right. Down is not allowed.\n\nNow, grid size: walls at borders, so x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Cells outside are walls, but since it's border cells, we can assume the playable area is within x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7, inclusive? Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning that if you try to move to x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7, it's a wall collision. Similarly, internal obstacle at (4,6), so cannot move there.\n\nAlso, snake body: positions (5,3) head, (5,2) body, (4,2) tail.\n\nSince the tail will move when the snake moves, depending on whether it eats food or not.\n\nIf the snake eats food, it grows, so the tail doesn't move; new segment added at head position after moving.\n\nStandard snake mechanics: when snake moves to a cell, if that cell has food, it eats it, grows by one segment, so the tail stays in place. If no food, it moves, so tail moves away from its current position.\n\nIn this case, when head moves to a new cell:\n\n- If that cell has food, snake grows: head is now on the food cell, and a new segment is added, so the tail remains where it was. The body segments don't move that turn? No.\n\nStandard: when the head moves to a new cell:\n\n- If food, then the snake adds a new segment at the head position, so the head moves to the food cell, and all body segments stay, so the snake grows by one.\n\n- If no food, head moves to new cell, and tail moves away from its position, so the last segment is removed.\n\nIn terms of positions: before move, positions [head, body, ..., tail]\n\nAfter move, if no food: new head position, then the previous head becomes body, and so on, up to the second last segment, and the tail position is vacated.\n\nIf food eaten: new head position (food cell), then previous positions all remain, so the snake is longer.\n\nIn this case, snake has three segments: head (5,3), body (5,2), tail (4,2).\n\nIf head moves to a new position without eating, new positions: new head, then (5,3) becomes body, (5,2) becomes tail, and (4,2) is vacated.\n\nIf head eats food, new positions: new head (food cell), then (5,3), (5,2), (4,2) all remain, so snake has four segments.\n\nAlso, collision: if head moves into a wall or into a body segment except the tail, it dies.\n\nBut if it moves into the tail cell, it might be ok if the tail moves away.\n\nSpecifically, if the head moves to the current tail cell, and there is no food, then the tail moves away, so head and tail don't collide because tail leaves the cell.\n\nBut if there is food on the tail cell, and head moves to it, it might cause collision because after eating, the tail doesn't move, so head and new tail are on the same cell? Let's see the rule.\n\n**Tail Reward Danger**: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nSo, if the tail cell has food, and head moves to it, since it eats the food, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, meaning that after eating, the head is on the food cell (which was tail), and the tail is still there, so they are on the same cell, collision.\n\nTherefore, moving to tail cell with food is deadly.\n\nIf no food on tail cell, moving to it is safe because tail moves away.\n\nAlso, food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away first.\n\nIn this case, no food under body currently, I think.\n\nLet's list all cells.\n\nGrid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all border cells, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacle: (4,6)\n\nSnake: (5,3), (5,2), (4,2)\n\nFood: (1,2), (3,5), (6,5)\n\nNow, head at (5,3), direction Up.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Up: to (5,4)\n\n- Left: to (4,3)\n\n- Right: to (6,3)\n\nDown not allowed, reverse.\n\nNow, check each for immediate safety:\n\nFirst, Up to (5,4): is this safe?\n\n(5,4) is within bounds? x=5, y=4, both between 0 and 7, not border, so not wall. Not internal obstacle, obstacle is (4,6). Not occupied by body? Body positions: (5,3) is head, will move, (5,2) and (4,2). (5,4) is empty, I think. Food positions are (1,2), (3,5), (6,5), not (5,4). So (5,4) is empty, no wall, no body, so safe to move.\n\nBut need to think ahead.\n\nLeft to (4,3): (4,3) is within bounds, x=4, y=3. Not border, not obstacle (4,6 is obstacle, but different y). Not body: current body (5,2) and (4,2), (4,3) is empty? Snake positions are (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), so (4,3) is free. Food not there. So safe.\n\nRight to (6,3): (6,3) within bounds, x=6, y=3. Not border? x=6, but walls at x=7 and x=0, so x=6 is not wall, y=3 not wall. Internal obstacle (4,6), not here. Not body. Food at (6,5), not (6,3). So all three moves are immediately safe.\n\nNow, need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritize survival.\n\nFood locations:\n\n(1,2) - value 1, life span 4, so available until turn 9 (since turn 6,7,8,9 present, gone turn 10)\n\nLife span 4 at turn 6: turn 6,7,8,9 present, after turn 9, gone.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) life span 4, same, turns 6-9.\n\n(6,5) life span 8, turns 6 to 13.\n\nAll value 1.\n\nSnake is at (5,3), with body (5,2) and tail (4,2).\n\nTo eat food, need to get to food cells.\n\n(1,2) is at x=1,y=2\n\n(3,5) at x=3,y=5\n\n(6,5) at x=6,y=5\n\nHead at (5,3)\n\nDistance to (1,2): |5-1| + |3-2| = 4 + 1 = 5 Manhattan distance.\n\nTo (3,5): |5-3| + |3-5| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nTo (6,5): |5-6| + |3-5| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n(6,5) is closest, only 3 steps away.\n\n(3,5) is 4 steps, (1,2) is 5 steps.\n\nBut (1,2) has shorter life, only until turn 9, while (6,5) lasts longer, but since we can eat multiple, we should consider paths.\n\nAlso, need to avoid risks.\n\nFirst, let's consider possible moves for turn 6.\n\nAfter moving, the snake will have new positions.\n\nAlso, after moving, if no food eaten, tail moves, so positions change.\n\nIf food eaten, snake grows.\n\nCurrently no food at possible move cells, so if we move to (5,4), (4,3), or (6,3), no food there, so no growth, tail moves.\n\nSo after turn 6:\n\nIf move Up to (5,4), new head (5,4), then body (5,3), tail (5,2)? Positions: head was (5,3), moves to (5,4), so new positions: [(5,4), (5,3), (5,2)] but tail was (4,2), which moves? Since no food, tail moves away.\n\nSequence: before move: positions [H: (5,3), B1: (5,2), B2: (4,2)] B2 is tail.\n\nAfter move to (5,4) with no food: new head at (5,4), then previous head (5,3) becomes body, previous body (5,2) becomes tail, and previous tail (4,2) is vacated. So new positions: [(5,4), (5,3), (5,2)]\n\nSimilarly, if move Left to (4,3): new head (4,3), then (5,3) becomes body, (5,2) becomes tail, vacate (4,2). Positions: [(4,3), (5,3), (5,2)]\n\nIf move Right to (6,3): new head (6,3), then (5,3) body, (5,2) tail, vacate (4,2). Positions: [(6,3), (5,3), (5,2)]\n\nNow, for each, we need to think future moves.\n\nAlso, food life spans decrease after each turn.\n\nTurn 6: current turn, we move, then after move, if we ate food, but no food at possible cells, so no eat.\n\nThen turn 7, and so on.\n\nWe need to plan a sequence of moves to eat food safely.\n\n(6,5) is close and has long life, so maybe head towards it.\n\nFrom (5,3), to get to (6,5), one way is to go right to (6,3), then up to (6,4), then up to (6,5). But (6,5) has food, so if we go to (6,5) on some turn, we eat it.\n\nSimilarly, to (3,5), from (5,3), could go left to (4,3), then up to (4,4), then left to (3,4), then up to (3,5), or other paths.\n\nBut there is an obstacle at (4,6), which might be in the way if we go up.\n\nAlso, (1,2) is farther and shorter life, so maybe not priority, but we can consider.\n\nSince all food is positive, we want to eat as many as possible without dying.\n\nBut survival first.\n\nNow, let's think about the tail position.\n\nCurrent tail is at (4,2). After any move without eating, tail moves to (5,2) if we move up or right, or to (5,3) if we move left? From above.\n\nIf move Up: positions [(5,4), (5,3), (5,2)] so tail at (5,2)\n\nIf move Left: [(4,3), (5,3), (5,2)] tail at (5,2)\n\nIf move Right: [(6,3), (5,3), (5,2)] tail at (5,2)\n\nIn all cases, after turn 6, tail is at (5,2), since previous body (5,2) becomes tail.\n\nPrevious positions: head (5,3), body (5,2), tail (4,2)\n\nAfter move, new head, then (5,3) becomes body, (5,2) becomes tail, and (4,2) gone.\n\nSo yes, in all cases, after turn 6, tail is at (5,2).\n\nNow, the food at (1,2) is at y=2, same as tail y, but x=1.\n\n(1,2) might be risky if we go near, but not immediately.\n\nAlso, head direction after move.\n\nIf we move Up, new head direction Up.\n\nIf Left, new direction Left.\n\nIf Right, new direction Right.\n\nFor turn 7, we need to consider the new state.\n\nI should consider each option for turn 6 and simulate a few steps.\n\nSince we need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should plan a path to the nearest food or something.\n\nLet me sketch a grid mentally.\n\nGrid rows y=0 to 7, columns x=0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n\nObstacle at (4,6)\n\nSnake: head (5,3), body (5,2), tail (4,2)\n\nFood: (1,2), (3,5), (6,5)\n\n(1,2) is at bottom left, (3,5) middle top, (6,5) top right.\n\nHead at (5,3), which is above the body.\n\nTo reach (6,5): from (5,3), if go right to (6,3), then up to (6,4), then up to (6,5). That's 3 moves.\n\nBut on turn 6, if go right to (6,3), then turn 7 to (6,4), turn 8 to (6,5), eat on turn 8.\n\n(6,5) life span 8, turn 6 to 13, so turn 8 is fine.\n\nSimilarly, to (3,5): from (5,3), go left to (4,3), then up to (4,4), then left to (3,4), then up to (3,5), 4 moves, eat on turn 10? Turn 6: left to (4,3), turn 7: up to (4,4), turn 8: left to (3,4), turn 9: up to (3,5). But (3,5) life span 4 at turn 6, so turn 9 is the last turn it is present, so we can eat on turn 9.\n\nTurn 6: life_span=4, present turn 6,7,8,9. After turn 9, gone. So eating on turn 9 is ok.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2): from (5,3), need to go left and down, but down not possible, so first left to (4,3), then down? But from (4,3), can go down to (4,2), but (4,2) is current tail, but on turn 6 if we move, tail moves.\n\nLet's not go to (1,2) yet, as it's farther.\n\n(6,5) is closer and easier.\n\nBut let's check if there are risks.\n\nFor example, if we go right to (6,3) on turn 6.\n\nThen positions: [(6,3), (5,3), (5,2)] head at (6,3), direction Right (since moved right).\n\nNow turn 7: from (6,3), can move Up, Down, Left, Right? But current direction Right, so cannot move Left (opposite).\n\nAllowed: Up, Down, Right.\n\nNow, to go to (6,5), best to go Up to (6,4).\n\n(6,4) is safe? Within bounds, no wall, no obstacle, no body: body is (5,3) and (5,2), so (6,4) empty.\n\nThen move to (6,4) on turn 7.\n\nNew positions: head (6,4), body (6,3), tail (5,3)? After move to (6,4) no food, so new head (6,4), then (6,3) becomes body, (5,3) becomes tail, vacate (5,2). Positions: [(6,4), (6,3), (5,3)]\n\nTail at (5,3).\n\nNow turn 8: from (6,4), direction Up (since moved up), can move Up, Left, Right? Cannot move Down, opposite.\n\nMove Up to (6,5), which has food.\n\n(6,5) has food, so we eat it.\n\nAfter moving to (6,5), we eat the food, so snake grows: new head at (6,5), and the body segments stay, so positions: new head (6,5), then previous positions [(6,4), (6,3), (5,3)] all remain, so snake now: [(6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)] with head at (6,5), tail at (5,3).\n\nWe scored +1, length increased.\n\nNow, food at (6,5) is eaten, so removed.\n\nOther food still there.\n\nLife spans: after turn 6, food life spans decrease.\n\nTurn 6: food life spans as given.\n\nAfter turn 6, before turn 7, life spans decrease by 1.\n\nSo at turn 7, (1,2) life_span=3 (was 4, decreased to 3)\n\n(3,5) life_span=3\n\n(6,5) life_span=7, but we eat it on turn 8, so gone.\n\nIn the sequence above, we eat on turn 8.\n\nNow, after eating, snake has 4 segments: head (6,5), body (6,4), (6,3), tail (5,3)\n\nDirection: last move was Up to (6,5), so head direction Up.\n\nNow we can plan further, but for now, this seems safe.\n\nBut we need to think beyond.\n\nAfter eating, we have to avoid colliding with body.\n\nNow, from (6,5), possible moves: Up, Down, Left, Right. But cannot move Down (opposite to current Up), so Up, Left, Right.\n\nUp to (6,6): (6,6) is within bounds? y=6, but walls at y=7, so y=6 is not wall, but y=7 is wall, so (6,6) is ok. x=6, y=6, not border, since border is y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is inside. Similarly, not obstacle, no body. Body positions: (6,4), (6,3), (5,3), so (6,6) empty. Safe.\n\nBut if we go up, to (6,6), then we might be near wall, but not immediately dangerous.\n\nLeft to (5,5): (5,5) is empty? No body, not food, safe.\n\nRight to (7,5): x=7 is wall, so collision, die. Cannot move right.\n\nSo from (6,5), can go Up or Left or Down, but Down not allowed, so only Up or Left.\n\nIf go Up to (6,6), or Left to (5,5).\n\n(5,5) is closer to other food, like (3,5).\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, back to turn 6.\n\nIf we go right on turn 6, we can eat (6,5) by turn 8.\n\nBut is there a risk? For example, the food at (1,2) is at (1,2), and tail is at (5,2) after turn 6, same y=2.\n\nBut (1,2) is far, so not immediate.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (4,6), but we are going to (6,5), not near it.\n\nNow, alternative move on turn 6: go Up to (5,4)\n\nThen positions: [(5,4), (5,3), (5,2)] head at (5,4), direction Up.\n\nThen turn 7: from (5,4), can move Up, Left, Right (no Down, opposite).\n\nNow, to go to (6,5), we need to go right and up.\n\nFor example, move Right to (6,4) on turn 7.\n\n(6,4) safe? Yes, empty.\n\nThen positions: head (6,4), body (5,4), tail (5,3)? After move: new head (6,4), previous head (5,4) body, previous body (5,3) tail, vacate (5,2). Positions: [(6,4), (5,4), (5,3)]\n\nThen turn 8: from (6,4), can move Up to (6,5), eat food.\n\nSimilar, eat on turn 8.\n\nBut in this case, we moved to (5,4) first, then to (6,4), then to (6,5), same as before but one step different.\n\nIn first path, turn 6: right to (6,3), turn 7: up to (6,4), turn 8: up to (6,5)\n\nIn second, turn 6: up to (5,4), turn 7: right to (6,4), turn 8: up to (6,5)\n\nBoth reach (6,5) on turn 8.\n\nNow, if we go Left on turn 6 to (4,3)\n\nThen positions: [(4,3), (5,3), (5,2)] head at (4,3), direction Left.\n\nThen to go to (6,5), it's farther, need to go right and up.\n\nFor example, turn 7: from (4,3), can move Up, Down, Right? Cannot move Left, opposite.\n\nCurrent direction Left, so cannot move Right? Opposite to Left is Right? Directions: U, D, L, R. If current direction L, opposite is R, so cannot move R.\n\nAllowed: U, D, L.\n\nBut L to (3,3) or U to (4,4) or D to (4,2).\n\n(4,2) was tail, but now vacated, so empty.\n\nBut to go to (6,5), we need to go right, but cannot immediately, since cannot reverse.\n\nSo from (4,3), if we go Up to (4,4), then turn 8, from (4,4), direction Up, can move U, L, R.\n\nThen can move Right to (5,4), and so on, but it takes more turns to reach (6,5).\n\nSimilarly, if go Left to (3,3), then further away.\n\nSo going left first is less efficient for reaching (6,5).\n\nWe could go towards (3,5) instead.\n\nBut (3,5) has shorter life, only until turn 9.\n\nIf we go left on turn 6 to (4,3), then we can try to reach (3,5).\n\nFrom (4,3), turn 7: can move Up to (4,4), for example.\n\n(4,4) safe.\n\nThen positions: head (4,4), body (4,3), tail (5,3)? After move: new head (4,4), previous head (4,3) body, previous body (5,3) tail, vacate (5,2). Positions: [(4,4), (4,3), (5,3)]\n\nTail at (5,3).\n\nTurn 8: from (4,4), direction Up, can move U, L, R (no D).\n\nNow, to (3,5), we can move Left to (3,4) or Up to (4,5), etc.\n\n(4,5) is at y=5, x=4.\n\nIs there obstacle? Obstacle at (4,6), so (4,5) is ok, but (4,6) is blocked.\n\nTo reach (3,5), from (4,4), move Left to (3,4).\n\n(3,4) safe? Yes.\n\nThen positions: head (3,4), body (4,4), tail (4,3)\n\nThen turn 9: from (3,4), direction Left, can move U, D, L (no R).\n\nThen move Up to (3,5), eat food.\n\n(3,5) is present until turn 9, so eating on turn 9 is ok.\n\nThen we eat on turn 9.\n\nBut in this case, we eat later, and (6,5) might be eaten earlier if we go that way.\n\nBut we can only eat one at a time.\n\nNow, comparing the two foods: (6,5) is closer and can be eaten by turn 8 with the first move, while (3,5) by turn 9.\n\nBut (3,5) life is shorter, but we can still eat it on turn 9.\n\nHowever, after eating (6,5), we can then go to (3,5) or others.\n\nSimilarly, after eating (3,5), we can go to (6,5).\n\nBut (6,5) has longer life, so less urgent.\n\nAlso, the snake grows, which might make it harder to maneuver in tight spaces.\n\nCurrently small snake, size 3.\n\nAfter eating one food, size 4.\n\nIn the path to (6,5), when we eat on turn 8, snake size 4.\n\nThen from there, we can go to (3,5).\n\n(3,5) at (3,5), we at (6,5) after eating.\n\nDistance |6-3| + |5-5| = 3, so 3 moves away.\n\nBut after eating, we are at (6,5), direction Up.\n\nTurn 8: just ate, so positions [(6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (5,3)] head (6,5), direction Up.\n\nNow turn 9: from (6,5), can move Up or Left (since no Down allowed).\n\nIf move Left to (5,5), for example.\n\n(5,5) safe? No body, not wall.\n\nThen positions: head (5,5), body (6,5), (6,4), tail (6,3)? After move no food (assuming), so new head (5,5), then (6,5) body, (6,4) body, (6,3) tail, vacate (5,3). Positions: [(5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)]\n\nTail at (6,3).\n\nThen turn 10: from (5,5), direction Left (moved left), can move U, D, L? Cannot move Right, opposite.\n\nMove Left to (4,5), for example.\n\n(4,5) is safe? But obstacle at (4,6), not (4,5), so ok.\n\n(4,5) empty? No body, not food.\n\nFood at (3,5), but we are going to it.\n\nMove to (4,5).\n\nPositions: head (4,5), body (5,5), (6,5), tail (6,4)? After move: new head (4,5), then (5,5) body, (6,5) body, (6,4) tail, vacate (6,3). Positions: [(4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)]\n\nTail at (6,4).\n\nThen turn 11: from (4,5), direction Left, can move U, D, L (no R).\n\nMove Left to (3,5), which has food, eat it.\n\n(3,5) life span: at turn 6, life_span=4, so turn 6,7,8,9 present. Turn 11 is after turn 9, so it might be gone.\n\nTurn 6: present\n\nAfter turn 6, life_span=3 for turn 7\n\nTurn 7: present, life_span=2 for turn 8? After each turn, life span decreases.\n\nAt start of turn t, food has life_span L, present during turn t.\n\nAfter turn t, before turn t+1, life_span decreases to L-1.\n\nSo for (3,5):\n\nTurn 6: life_span=4, present\n\nTurn 7: life_span=3, present\n\nTurn 8: life_span=2, present\n\nTurn 9: life_span=1, present\n\nAfter turn 9, life_span=0, disappears, not present turn 10.\n\nSo on turn 11, (3,5) is not there.\n\nWe can only eat it by turn 9.\n\nIn the sequence above, if we go to (3,5) on turn 11, it's gone.\n\nIn the direct path to (3,5) from start, we could eat on turn 9.\n\nBut with the detour to (6,5), we miss (3,5).\n\n(1,2) also short life.\n\nIf we go directly to (3,5) first, we can eat it on turn 9, but then (6,5) is still there, we can go after.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nBack to turn 6 decision.\n\nOption 1: Move Right to (6,3) on turn 6, then Up to (6,4) on turn 7, then Up to (6,5) on turn 8 to eat.\n\nThen on turn 8, we have eaten one food.\n\nNow, from there, we can try to eat (1,2) or something, but (1,2) gone by turn 10, and we are at (6,5) on turn 8, to (1,2) is |6-1| + |5-2| = 5+3=8 steps, but with snake moving, and walls, it might take more than 2 turns to reach, since turn 9,10,11, but (1,2) gone after turn 9, so we can't reach it by turn 9 from (6,5).\n\nFrom (6,5) on turn 8, to (1,2): min Manhattan distance 5+3=8, but with obstacles, but no direct obstacles, path exists, e.g., left and down, but each move one step, so at least 8 moves, but we have only turn 9 to eat, since turn 10 not present.\n\nTurn 8 after move, we are at (6,5), turn 9 we can move, but (1,2) is present turn 9, so we need to be at (1,2) on turn 9 to eat.\n\nBut from (6,5) to (1,2) in one move? Impossible, distance 8, so we cannot reach (1,2) by turn 9 if we are at (6,5) on turn 8.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) we cannot reach by turn 9 from (6,5) on turn 8.\n\n|6-3| + |5-5| = 3, so from (6,5) on turn 8, we can move to, say, (5,5) on turn 9, but (5,5) not food, or to (6,4) down, but cannot if direction up, etc.\n\nFrom (6,5) turn 8, direction up, we can move left to (5,5) on turn 9, or up to (6,6), but not to (3,5) directly.\n\n(3,5) is 3 left, same y, but we can only move one step per turn.\n\nOn turn 9, we can be at (5,5) or (6,6), not (3,5).\n\n(3,5) requires at least 3 moves: left to (5,5), left to (4,5), left to (3,5), but (4,5) is ok, obstacle at (4,6).\n\nBut from (6,5) to (5,5) turn 9, (4,5) turn 10, (3,5) turn 11, but (3,5) gone after turn 9, so not present on turn 11.\n\nThus, if we eat (6,5) on turn 8, we miss (3,5) and (1,2) because they expire soon.\n\n(1,2) expires turn 9, (3,5) turn 9.\n\nSo we can only eat one of the short-life foods if we go for it directly.\n\nIf on turn 6 we go left to (4,3), we can reach (3,5) by turn 9 as earlier.\n\nThen after eating (3,5) on turn 9, we can go to (6,5) which is still there.\n\n(6,5) life span 8, turn 6 to 13, so turn 9 to 13 present.\n\nAfter turn 9, we are at (3,5), just ate, so positions depend.\n\nIn that path: if we go to (3,5) on turn 9.\n\nFrom earlier: turn 6: left to (4,3)\n\nTurn 7: up to (4,4)\n\nTurn 8: left to (3,4)? Earlier I had turn 8 to (3,4)\n\nTurn 6: left to (4,3)\n\nTurn 7: up to (4,4)  // direction up\n\nTurn 8: from (4,4), can move left to (3,4) or up to (4,5), etc.\n\nIf move left to (3,4), direction left.\n\nThen turn 9: from (3,4), direction left, move up to (3,5), eat.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows: new head (3,5), body (3,4), (4,4), tail (4,3)? Positions before move: head (3,4), body (4,4), tail (4,3) or something.\n\nBefore turn 9 move: positions from turn 8: after turn 8 move to (3,4), positions: [(3,4), (4,4), (4,3)] head (3,4), body (4,4), tail (4,3)\n\nThen turn 9: move to (3,5), which has food, eat.\n\nSo new positions: head (3,5), then (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) all remain, so snake [(3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3)] size 4.\n\nNow, we are at (3,5), direction Up (moved up).\n\nNow (6,5) is still available.\n\nFrom (3,5) to (6,5): |3-6| + |5-5| = 3, same row.\n\nWe can move right, but current direction Up, so on turn 10, from (3,5), direction Up, can move U, L, R (no D).\n\nMove Right to (4,5).\n\n(4,5) safe? Not wall, no obstacle, no body. Body is (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), so (4,5) empty.\n\nMove to (4,5).\n\nNo food, so snake moves: new head (4,5), then (3,5) body, (3,4) body, (4,4) tail, vacate (4,3). Positions: [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4)]\n\nTail at (4,4).\n\nTurn 11: from (4,5), direction Right (moved right), can move U, D, R (no L).\n\nMove Right to (5,5).\n\n(5,5) safe.\n\nPositions: head (5,5), body (4,5), (3,5), tail (3,4)? After move: new head (5,5), then (4,5) body, (3,5) body, (3,4) tail, vacate (4,4). Positions: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nTail at (3,4).\n\nTurn 12: from (5,5), direction Right, can move U, D, R (no L).\n\nMove Right to (6,5), eat food.\n\n(6,5) has food, life span long, so present.\n\nEat, grow: new head (6,5), body (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), tail (3,4)? Positions: [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] and (3,4) gone? After eating, all previous segments remain, so from before move, positions were [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4)], after move to (6,5) with food, new head (6,5), then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), and (3,4) remains, so snake size 5: [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nWe ate two foods: (3,5) and (6,5).\n\nAnd (1,2) expired, but we didn't reach it.\n\nNow, compare to if we go to (6,5) first: we eat one food, but miss the other two short-life ones.\n\nBy going to (3,5) first, we eat both (3,5) and (6,5), but (1,2) is missed, but it was farther and we might not have time anyway.\n\n(1,2) at (1,2), from start at (5,3), distance 5, min turns to reach: 5 moves, but with direction constraints.\n\nFor example, from (5,3) turn 6, if we go left to (4,3), turn 7 down to (4,2)? But (4,2) was tail, but after move, it might be vacated.\n\nOn turn 6, if move left to (4,3), positions [(4,3), (5,3), (5,2)]\n\nThen turn 7, from (4,3), direction Left, can move U, D, L.\n\nIf move Down to (4,2), (4,2) is where tail was, but now empty? After turn 6, positions [(4,3), (5,3), (5,2)], so (4,2) is empty.\n\nMove to (4,2), no food, so positions: new head (4,2), then (4,3) body, (5,3) tail, vacate (5,2). Positions: [(4,2), (4,3), (5,3)]\n\nThen turn 8, from (4,2), direction Down, can move D, L, R (no U).\n\nMove Left to (3,2).\n\n(3,2) safe.\n\nPositions: [(3,2), (4,2), (4,3)]\n\nThen turn 9, from (3,2), direction Left, move Up to (3,3)? To go to (1,2), need left.\n\nMove Left to (2,2).\n\n(2,2) safe.\n\nPositions: [(2,2), (3,2), (4,2)]\n\nThen turn 10, from (2,2), direction Left, move Left to (1,2), but (1,2) has food, but life span: at turn 6, life_span=4, so turn 9 last present. Turn 10 not present.\n\nOn turn 10, (1,2) not there.\n\nTo eat on turn 9, we need to be at (1,2) on turn 9.\n\nFrom above, on turn 9 we are at (3,2) or (2,2), not (1,2).\n\nFrom start, min to (1,2): e.g., turn 6: left to (4,3), turn 7: down to (4,2), turn 8: left to (3,2), turn 9: left to (2,2), turn 10: left to (1,2), but (1,2) gone turn 10.\n\nTurn 6: left to (4,3), turn 7: left to (3,3), turn 8: down to (3,2), turn 9: left to (2,2), same.\n\nCannot reach by turn 9, since from (5,3) to (1,2) is 4 steps in x, 1 in y, but with direction, might take 5 moves if not direct.\n\nBut even direct: down-left-left-left-left, but down not possible from (5,3) since direction up, cannot down.\n\nSo must go left first or up or right, but left is possible.\n\nTurn 6: left to (4,3), now direction left.\n\nTurn 7: left to (3,3), direction left.\n\nTurn 8: down to (3,2), now direction down.\n\nTurn 9: left to (2,2), or to (3,1) but not towards.\n\nTo (1,2), from (3,2) turn 9, move left to (2,2), then turn 10 to (1,2), too late.\n\nFrom (3,2) turn 9, if we could move left twice, but only one move per turn.\n\nSo impossible to reach (1,2) by turn 9 from start, since min 4 moves: e.g., left, left, down, left but positions: (4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (2,2) on turn 9, not (1,2).\n\n(1,2) requires at least 4 left and 1 down, but since start at x=5, to x=1, 4 steps left, y from 3 to 2, one down, but can combine, but with direction, might be 5 moves.\n\nBut turn 6 to 9 is 4 moves: turn 6,7,8,9 moves.\n\nAfter turn 6 move, position after turn 6.\n\nTurn 6: move to new cell, after turn 6.\n\nTurn 7: move, after turn 7 position, and so on.\n\nAfter turn 9 move, we are at a position.\n\nTo eat on turn 9, we move to food cell on turn 9 move.\n\nSo we need to be at a cell adjacent to food on turn 8, and move to it on turn 9.\n\nBut (1,2) at turn 9.\n\nFrom start (5,3) after turn 6: after 3 moves, after turn 8, we can be at (2,2) or (1,3) etc., not (1,2) directly, and from there to (1,2) on turn 9.\n\nFor example, after turn 8 at (2,2), then turn 9 move to (1,2) if possible.\n\n(2,2) to (1,2) left, but direction from (2,2) might not allow, but possible.\n\nBut after turn 8 at (2,2): let's sequence.\n\nTurn 6: from (5,3) left to (4,3)  // after turn 6 at (4,3)\n\nTurn 7: from (4,3) down to (4,2)  // after turn 7 at (4,2)\n\nTurn 8: from (4,2) left to (3,2)  // after turn 8 at (3,2)\n\nThen turn 9: from (3,2) left to (2,2) or down to (3,1) or up to (3,3), but to (1,2), need to go to (2,2) first, then turn 10 to (1,2), but turn 10 (1,2) not there.\n\nFrom (3,2) turn 9, if we go left to (2,2), we are at (2,2) after turn 9, not on (1,2).\n\nTo be on (1,2) after turn 9 move, we need to move to (1,2) on turn 9, so from turn 8 position, must be adjacent to (1,2).\n\nAdjacent cells: (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), (2,2)\n\n(0,2) is wall, x=0.\n\n(1,1) and (1,3) possible.\n\nSo on turn 8 after move, we need to be at (1,1), (1,3), or (2,2).\n\n(2,2) is adjacent, yes.\n\nFrom start, to reach one of these by turn 8.\n\nFor example, to (2,2):\n\nFrom (5,3) turn 6 left to (4,3)\n\nTurn 7 left to (3,3)\n\nTurn 8 down to (3,2)  // (3,2) not (2,2)\n\nTurn 6 left to (4,3)\n\nTurn 7 down to (4,2)\n\nTurn 8 left to (3,2)  // (3,2)\n\nNot (2,2).\n\nTurn 6 left to (4,3)\n\nTurn 7 left to (3,3)  // at (3,3) after turn 7\n\nTurn 8 left to (2,3)  // (2,3)\n\nThen (2,3) is adjacent to (1,3) and (2,2), but not directly to (1,2).\n\nFrom (2,3), we can move to (1,3) or (2,2) or (2,4) or (3,3), but not to (1,2) directly.\n\n(1,2) is not adjacent to (2,3); adjacent are (2,2), (2,4), (1,3), (3,3).\n\n(1,2) is at (1,2), adjacent: (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), (2,2)\n\n(0,2) wall.\n\nSo from (2,3), we can go to (2,2) or (1,3), both adjacent to (1,2).\n\nBut on turn 9, from (2,3) after turn 8, move to say (2,2) or (1,3), then on turn 10 to (1,2), but (1,2) gone.\n\nTo be at (1,2) on turn 9, we need to move to it on turn 9, so from a cell adjacent on turn 8 position.\n\nFor example, if after turn 8 at (2,2), then turn 9 move left to (1,2).\n\nBut to be at (2,2) after turn 8.\n\nFrom (5,3) to (2,2): |5-2| + |3-2| = 3+1=4 moves.\n\nTurn 6: move to, say, (4,3) left\n\nTurn 7: move to (3,3) left\n\nTurn 8: move to (2,3) left or to (3,2) down, not to (2,2) directly from (3,3).\n\nFrom (3,3), to go to (2,2), we need to move down-left or left-down, but one move per turn.\n\nAfter turn 7 at (3,3), turn 8 move: can move down to (3,2) or left to (2,3) or up, etc.\n\nIf move down to (3,2), at (3,2) after turn 8.\n\nThen not at (2,2).\n\nIf move left to (2,3), at (2,3) after turn 8.\n\nNeither is (2,2).\n\n(2,2) can be reached from (3,2) or (2,3) or (2,1) or (1,2), but from (3,3), not directly adjacent; (3,3) adjacent to (3,2), (3,4), (2,3), (4,3).\n\n(2,2) is not adjacent to (3,3); it's diagonal.\n\nSo from (3,3), it takes two moves to (2,2): e.g., to (3,2) then to (2,2), or to (2,3) then to (2,2).\n\nBut each takes a turn.\n\nSo to be at (2,2) after turn 8, we need to start moving earlier.\n\nTurn 6: after move at new position, say (4,3)\n\nTurn 7: after move at, say (3,3) or (4,2)\n\nTurn 8: after move at (2,2) only if from (3,2) or (2,3) or (2,1) or (1,2), but (1,2) not, (2,1) might be.\n\nBut from (4,3) turn 6, turn 7 move to (3,3), turn 8 move to (3,2) or (2,3), not (2,2).\n\nFrom (4,3) turn 6, turn 7 move down to (4,2), turn 8 move left to (3,2), at (3,2) after turn 8.\n\nThen turn 9 move left to (2,2), at (2,2) after turn 9.\n\nBut we need to be at (2,2) after turn 8 to move to (1,2) on turn 9.\n\nSince at (3,2) after turn 8, we can move to (2,2) on turn 9, but that's to (2,2), not to (1,2) yet.\n\nThen on turn 10 to (1,2), too late.\n\nSimilarly, no way to reach (1,2) by turn 9, so it's impossible to eat (1,2) because it expires too soon and we are too far.\n\nSimilarly, for (3,5), we can reach it by turn 9 if we head directly.\n\n(6,5) is easy to reach and has long life.\n\nBut by going to (6,5) first, we miss (3,5).\n\nBy going to (3,5) first, we can also get (6,5) later.\n\nIn terms of score, eating both is better.\n\nAlso, survival: both paths seem safe so far.\n\nNow, back to turn 6, if we go left, we can eat (3,5) on turn 9 and (6,5) on turn 12, for example.\n\nIf we go right or up, we eat (6,5) on turn 8, but miss (3,5).\n\nSo better to go left on turn 6 to target (3,5).\n\nMoreover, in the left move, we are moving towards (3,5).\n\nBut let's confirm the direction.\n\nOn turn 6, move Left to (4,3).\n\nThen as above.\n\nBut when we move to (4,3), is there any risk?\n\n(4,3) is safe, as we said.\n\nThen future moves.\n\nBut we need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe answer format is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but we don't know how many, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", probably output a sequence of 5 moves or so.\n\nBut it might depend.\n\nPerhaps output until we eat a food or something.\n\nBut to be precise, let's decide the first move.\n\nI think going left on turn 6 is better to get both foods.\n\nThen actions:\n\nTurn 6: move Left to (4,3)\n\nThen turn 7: from (4,3), we need to go up, so move Up to (4,4)\n\nTurn 8: from (4,4), move Left to (3,4) to approach (3,5)\n\nThen turn 9: from (3,4), move Up to (3,5) to eat.\n\nThen after that, as above, turn 10: from (3,5), move Right to (4,5) assuming direction up, but after eating at (3,5), direction up, so move right to (4,5)? (4,5) is x=4,y=5.\n\nThen turn 11: to (5,5), turn 12: to (6,5).\n\nBut we need to output actions starting from turn 6.\n\nAlso, for the internal obstacle at (4,6), when we go to (4,5) or (5,5), it might be near, but not blocking.\n\nIn turn 8, from (4,4), we could move up to (4,5) instead of left to (3,4), but then to (3,5) we need to go left from (4,5), which might be possible.\n\nBut from (4,4) turn 8, if move up to (4,5), direction up, then turn 9 move left to (3,5), which is adjacent, so eat on turn 9.\n\n(3,5) from (4,5) is left, same y.\n\nIn that case, turn 6: left to (4,3)\n\nTurn 7: up to (4,4)\n\nTurn 8: up to (4,5)  // (4,5) is safe, obstacle at (4,6) so (4,5) ok\n\nThen turn 9: from (4,5), direction up, can move left to (3,5), eat.\n\nThen positions after eating: head (3,5), body (4,5), (4,4), (4,3) or something.\n\nBefore turn 9: after turn 8, positions [(4,5), (4,4), (4,3)] head (4,5), body (4,4), tail (4,3)? After turn 7: from turn 6 left to (4,3), turn 7 up to (4,4), positions [(4,4), (4,3), (5,3)] tail (5,3)\n\nAfter turn 8 up to (4,5), no food, positions [(4,5), (4,4), (4,3)] head (4,5), body (4,4), tail (4,3)\n\nThen turn 9 move left to (3,5), eat, so new positions: [(3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3)] size 4.\n\nThen from there, to (6,5), we can go right.\n\nTurn 10: from (3,5), direction left (since moved left), can move U, D, L? Cannot move right, opposite.\n\nCurrent direction after move to (3,5) is left, so cannot move right immediately.\n\nProblem.\n\nFrom (3,5), direction left, allowed moves: Up, Down, Left.\n\nBut (6,5) is right, so we cannot go directly right.\n\nWe need to change direction.\n\nFor example, move Up to (3,6) or Down to (3,4), then later right.\n\nBut (3,6) is y=6, not wall, but obstacle at (4,6), not here.\n\nMove Up to (3,6), then turn 11, from (3,6), direction up, can move U, L, R (no D), move right to (4,6), but (4,6) is obstacle! Cannot.\n\n(4,6) is internal obstacle, so cannot move there.\n\nSo dead end.\n\nMove Down to (3,4) on turn 10.\n\n(3,4) might be empty.\n\nThen from (3,4), direction down, can move D, L, R (no U).\n\nThen move right to (4,4), etc., but takes longer.\n\nBetter to go directly from (4,4) to (3,4) on turn 8, then to (3,5) on turn 9.\n\nAs in the first subpath.\n\nTurn 6: left to (4,3)\n\nTurn 7: up to (4,4)\n\nTurn 8: left to (3,4)  // direction left\n\nThen turn 9: from (3,4), direction left, move up to (3,5), eat.\n\nAfter eating, direction up.\n\nThen turn 10: from (3,5), direction up, can move U, L, R (no D).\n\nMove Right to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 11: from (4,5), direction right, can move U, D, R (no L)\n\nMove Right to (5,5)\n\nTurn 12: from (5,5), direction right, move Right to (6,5), eat.\n\nAnd (6,5) still there.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we can output turns 6 to 10 or so.\n\nBut we need to think about the tail and dangers.\n\nIn this path, no immediate dangers.\n\nAnother thing: food under body, but no food under body now.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: but not applicable here.\n\nSo for turn 6, move Left.\n\nThen actions:\n\nTurn 6: L\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: L\n\nTurn 9: U (to eat)\n\nBut we need to specify for each turn.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 9 we move U to (3,5) to eat.\n\nThen after that, we can continue, but perhaps for the answer, since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", output 5 moves.\n\nFrom turn 6 to turn 10.\n\nTurn 6: L\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: L\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: R (to (4,5))\n\nBut turn 10 R is after eating.\n\nSince the food is eaten on turn 9, and we plan ahead.\n\nBut in the state, we start from turn 6.\n\nNow, to confirm, on turn 6, if we move right, we eat (6,5) earlier but miss (3,5), so worse.\n\nMove up is similar to right but might not help.\n\nSo Left is best.\n\nTherefore, for turn 6, action L.\n\nThen subsequent actions as above.\n\nBut in the answer format, we need to output a sequence.\n\nPerhaps:\n\nTurn 6: L\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: L\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nAnd that's 4 turns, but think 5+ ahead, so add one more, say turn 10: R\n\nBut since we are to maximize score, and we eat on turn 9.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nTo be complete.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned a sequence of moves that allows the snake to eat both the (3,5) and (6,5) food items, as they are reachable within their life spans. The (1,2) food is too far and expires too soon (by turn 10) to be safely reached from the starting position, so it is ignored. The path avoids collisions, respects movement constraints, and leverages the snake's growth to enable future food consumption.\n\n### Key Points from Analysis:\n- **Current State (Turn 6)**: Snake head at (5,3) with direction Up. Snake length is 3. Food available: (1,2) (life span 4, expires after turn 9), (3,5) (life span 4, expires after turn 9), (6,5) (life span 8, expires after turn 13). Internal obstacle at (4,6) and border walls.\n- **Immediate Move Constraints**: Current direction is Up, so Down is not allowed. Possible moves: Up (to (5,4)), Left (to (4,3)), or Right (to (6,3)).\n- **Food Priorities**: \n  - (3,5) is prioritized first because it expires soon (must be eaten by turn 9) and is reachable in 3 moves (eaten on turn 9). \n  - (6,5) has a longer life span and can be eaten after (3,5) on turn 12.\n  - (1,2) is unreachable by turn 9 due to distance and movement constraints, so it is skipped.\n- **Path Safety**: The chosen path avoids walls, obstacles, and body collisions. After eating (3,5) on turn 9, the snake grows to length 4, but the path to (6,5) remains safe. The internal obstacle at (4,6) is avoided by not moving to (4,5) when the direction could lead to a dead end.\n- **5+ Turn Plan**: The sequence covers 5 moves (turns 6 to 10) to ensure the snake eats (3,5) and positions for (6,5). Thinking beyond, (6,5) is eaten on turn 12.\n\n### Planned Move Sequence:\n- **Turn 6 (Current Turn)**: Move Left (L) to (4,3). This starts the path toward (3,5) and avoids the shorter-term risk of missing it. Direction changes to Left.\n- **Turn 7**: Move Up (U) to (4,4). This continues toward (3,5) and avoids obstacles. Direction changes to Up.\n- **Turn 8**: Move Left (L) to (3,4). This positions the snake adjacent to (3,5). Direction changes to Left.\n- **Turn 9**: Move Up (U) to (3,5) to eat the food. Snake grows to length 4, and direction changes to Up.\n- **Turn 10**: Move Right (R) to (4,5). This begins the path to (6,5) and avoids the obstacle at (4,6). Direction changes to Right.\n\n### Outcome and Further Moves:\n- By turn 9, (3,5) is eaten (score +1, length 4).\n- On turn 10, the snake moves to (4,5), setting up for (6,5).\n- **Beyond Turn 10**: \n  - Turn 11: Move Right to (5,5). \n  - Turn 12: Move Right to (6,5) to eat the food (score +1, length 5). \n  - (6,5) is safely eaten before it expires (life span until turn 13).\n\nThis plan eats two foods, maximizes score with minimal risk, and ensures survival by avoiding all collisions and leveraging the grid layout.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 7: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 8: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 9: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 10: R (right)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 7. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and one internal obstacle at (4,6). So the grid is 8x8? Let me confirm the coordinates. If x from 0 to 7 and y from 0 to 7, that's 8 cells in each direction, so a 8x8 grid.\n\nSnake positions: head at (4,3), then body at (5,3), then tail at (5,2). So the snake has three segments: head, one body, and tail. Length 3.\n\nHead direction is left, so it was moving left last turn. That means from (5,3) to (4,3), I assume. Positions are given as [(4,3), (5,3), (5,2)], so head is (4,3), previous was (5,3), and before that (5,2). Since it moved left to (4,3), the direction is L.\n\nNow food:\n\n- (1,2) with life span 3, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (3,5) with life span 3, value 1\n\n- (6,5) with life span 7, value 1\n\n- (2,4) with life span 10, value 1\n\nAll food is positive, value 1, so all good to eat, but I need to consider the risks.\n\nLife span decreases each turn, including current, so at turn 7, life span 3 means it will disappear after 3 more turns? Life span is given, and it decreases every turn. So for food at (1,2), life span 3 at turn 7, so it will disappear after turn 9? Let's see: life span N means it disappears after N turns, so if life span is S at turn T, it will be gone at turn T + S? But it says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nIt says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for a food with life span S at turn T, after this turn, at turn T+1, life span becomes S-1, and so on, until it reaches 0, and it disappears when life span is 0? But \"disappears after N turns\" might mean it is present for N turns including the current one or not.\n\nLet me read carefully: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nI think it means that at the start of turn T, if life span is S, then during turn T, it is present, and after turn T, life span decreases to S-1 for turn T+1. When life span becomes 0, it disappears, so it is not present on turns after that.\n\nFor example, food at (1,2) with life span 3 at turn 7: on turn 7, life span 3, present; after turn 7, life span 2 for turn 8; after turn 8, life span 1 for turn 9; after turn 9, life span 0, disappears, so not present on turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, for (3,5), life span 3 at turn 7, same as above.\n\n(6,5) life span 7, so will last until turn 13? Turn 7: span 7, turn 8: span 6, ..., turn 13: span 1, turn 14: span 0, disappear. But we need to think only a few turns ahead.\n\n(2,4) life span 10, long time.\n\nNow, the snake head is at (4,3), direction L, so it just moved left to (4,3).\n\nPossible moves: since direction is L, I can move U, D, L, but not R because reverse is not allowed. \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is L, so opposite is R. So cannot move right.\n\nPossible moves: Up, Down, Left. Left is continuing left.\n\nBut I need to check if the moves are valid, not into walls or body.\n\nFirst, let's list all wall cells: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSo grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at all x=0, all x=7, all y=0, all y=7. And cell (4,6) is wall.\n\nSnake positions: head (4,3), body (5,3), tail (5,2).\n\nNow, possible moves from (4,3):\n\n- Up (U): (x,y+1) = (4,4)\n\n- Down (D): (x,y-1) = (4,2)\n\n- Left (L): (x-1,y) = (3,3)\n\n- Right (R): (x+1,y) = (5,3) but (5,3) is occupied by body, and also, cannot move right because it's reverse direction? Reverse is not allowed, so cannot move R.\n\nBut even if it were allowed, (5,3) is body, so moving there would cause collision? But the body will move when the snake moves.\n\nImportant: when the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the body follows, so the tail moves away from its current position. So, moving to a cell that is currently occupied by the tail is safe because the tail will move, freeing up that cell.\n\nBut in this case, the tail is at (5,2), not at (5,3). (5,3) is the body segment, not the tail.\n\nSnake positions: index 0: head (4,3), index 1: body (5,3), index 2: tail (5,2).\n\nIf I move the head to a new position, say to (3,3) for left, then the new positions become: head at (3,3), then the old head becomes body, so (4,3) becomes body, and the old body (5,3) becomes the new tail? No.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, that becomes new head, the previous head becomes part of the body, and the tail is removed if no food eaten, or if food eaten, tail stays and body grows.\n\nBut in this case, when moving, if no food eaten, the tail moves away, so the cell that was tail is freed.\n\nSpecifically for collision: head can move to a cell that is currently occupied only if it is the tail cell, because the tail will move.\n\nBut if it moves to a body cell (not tail), it collides.\n\nAlso, walls are always deadly.\n\nSo, from (4,3), possible moves:\n\n- U to (4,4): what is at (4,4)? Not a wall? Walls: borders, so (4,4) is within x=1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 walls. x from 0 to 7, cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So (4,4): x=4 not 0 or 7, y=4 not 0 or 7, and not (4,6) which is internal wall? (4,6) is given, so (4,4) is not wall. Is there food? Food at (1,2), (3,5), (6,5), (2,4), not (4,4), so empty cell.\n\n- D to (4,2): (4,2), x=4 not border, y=2 not 0 or 7? y=0 is wall, y=2 is not 0, so not border. Not (4,6), so empty. Food? Not in list, so empty.\n\n- L to (3,3): (3,3), not border, not (4,6), no food listed, so empty.\n\n- R to (5,3): but (5,3) is currently occupied by body segment. Also, cannot move R because reverse direction not allowed.\n\nSo possible actions: U, D, L.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score with survival.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid for clarity.\n\nGrid 8x8, coordinates:\n\ny=7 top, y=0 bottom? Usually in grids, y increases up, but in coordinates, it might be specified. In the movement, U is (x,y+1), so y increases up, so y=0 bottom, y=7 top.\n\nSimilarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nWalls: all cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. And internal wall at (4,6).\n\nSo, for example, (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x, and (4,6).\n\nSnake: head (4,3), body (5,3), tail (5,2).\n\nFood: (1,2), (3,5), (6,5), (2,4)\n\nAll positive, value 1.\n\nNow, life spans: at turn 7, (1,2) span 3, so disappears after turn 9 (since after turn 9, span 0).\n\nTurn 7: span 3, present; turn 8: span 2, present; turn 9: span 1, present; turn 10: span 0, gone.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) span 3, same.\n\n(6,5) span 7, present until turn 13 (turn 13 span 1, turn 14 gone).\n\n(2,4) span 10, long time.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves for multiple turns, starting from turn 7.\n\nBut the answer should be actions for turn 7, turn 8, etc., up to say 5 turns or so, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but the output should be the actions for the current and future turns, I think, but it says \"Turn t1: action\" and so on, so for turn 7 and beyond.\n\nThe format is to output actions for several turns.\n\nBut I need to decide the sequence.\n\nAlso, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's see what food I can reach.\n\nNearest food: (2,4) at (2,4), which is left and up from head (4,3). Distance: dx=2, dy=1, so Manhattan distance 3.\n\n(3,5) at (3,5), dx=1, dy=2, distance 3.\n\n(1,2) at (1,2), dx=3, dy=1, distance 4.\n\n(6,5) at (6,5), dx=2, dy=2, distance 4.\n\nAll similar distances, but with life spans, (1,2) and (3,5) have short life, only 3 turns left including current, so they disappear soon.\n\n(1,2) life span 3 at turn 7, so must be eaten by turn 9 to get it.\n\nSimilarly for (3,5).\n\n(6,5) has longer life, span 7, so until turn 13.\n\n(2,4) span 10, until turn 16.\n\nBut I need to survive.\n\nAlso, the snake is small, length 3, so growing is good for more flexibility.\n\nNow, current possible moves from (4,3): U to (4,4), D to (4,2), L to (3,3).\n\nIf I move U to (4,4), then head at (4,4), body: previous head (4,3) becomes body, and tail: since no food, the tail (5,2) is removed, so new positions: head (4,4), body (4,3), and the old body (5,3) becomes tail? Let's see the sequence.\n\nCurrent positions: [ (4,3) head, (5,3) body, (5,2) tail ]\n\nAfter move to (4,4):\n\n- Head moves to (4,4)\n\n- The segment that was head, (4,3), becomes body\n\n- The body segment (5,3) remains body? No, in snake, when head moves, all segments shift, so the tail is removed if no growth.\n\nSpecifically: after moving head to new position, the previous head position is now part of the body, and the tail position is vacated if no food eaten.\n\nSo positions after move: head at new position, then the previous positions except the tail is removed.\n\nSo from [A, B, C] where A head, B body, C tail.\n\nMove head to D, no food: new positions [D, A, B] , so C is removed, B is now tail.\n\nIn this case, move to (4,4): new head (4,4), then (4,3) as body, then (5,3) as tail. The old tail (5,2) is gone.\n\nSimilarly, if move to (4,2): head (4,2), body (4,3), tail (5,3)\n\nIf move to (3,3): head (3,3), body (4,3), tail (5,3)\n\nNow, (5,3) was body, now tail, so it can be moved onto later if needed.\n\nNow, for each possible move, I need to simulate future turns.\n\nAlso, consider the tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut in this case, tail is at (5,2) or after move, it changes.\n\nFirst, at turn 7, tail is at (5,2), not adjacent to head. Head at (4,3), tail at (5,2), which are adjacent? (4,3) and (5,2): dx=1, dy=1, so diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n\nSo (4,3) and (5,2) are not adjacent; they are diagonal. Adjacent cells would be (4,3) and (4,4), (4,2), (3,3), (5,3).\n\n(5,3) is body, not tail.\n\nSo tail is at (5,2), which is not adjacent to (4,3). So no immediate danger.\n\nNow, let's evaluate options for turn 7.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (4,4)\n\nThen new positions: head (4,4), body (4,3), tail (5,3)\n\nNow at (4,4), no food. Head direction was L, but now moving U, so new direction U.\n\nFrom here, possible moves: U to (4,5), D to (4,3) but (4,3) is body, so cannot move there, L to (3,4), R to (5,4)\n\nD is down to (4,3), which is body, so collision if move there, unless it is tail and moves away, but (4,3) is body, not tail, tail is at (5,3).\n\n(5,3) is tail, so if head were to move to (5,3), it might be ok, but not from (4,4).\n\nFrom (4,4), moves:\n\n- U to (4,5): not wall, no food? Food not there, so empty.\n\n- D to (4,3): occupied by body, so deadly collision.\n\n- L to (3,4): not wall, empty.\n\n- R to (5,4): not wall, empty.\n\nAlso, cannot move opposite to new direction? New direction after move is U, so opposite is D, which is not possible anyway.\n\nSo from (4,4), can move U, L, R.\n\nBut moving D is invalid due to body.\n\nNow, if I go U to (4,5), then I can go towards food at (3,5) or (2,4), etc.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nOption 2: Move D to (4,2) from (4,3)\n\nThen new head (4,2), body (4,3), tail (5,3)\n\nAt (4,2), is there food? Food at (1,2), but (4,2) not food.\n\nMoves from (4,2): U to (4,3) but (4,3) is body, collision; D to (4,1), not wall; L to (3,2), not wall; R to (5,2), not wall? (5,2) was tail but now vacated? After move, positions: head (4,2), body (4,3), tail (5,3), so (5,2) is empty now.\n\n(5,2) was tail, but since no food eaten, it is removed, so cell free.\n\nSo from (4,2):\n\n- U to (4,3): occupied by body, deadly.\n\n- D to (4,1): not wall, empty.\n\n- L to (3,2): not wall, empty.\n\n- R to (5,2): not wall, empty (since tail moved).\n\nNew direction is D.\n\nOpposite would be U, which is invalid anyway.\n\nOption 3: Move L to (3,3) from (4,3)\n\nThen new head (3,3), body (4,3), tail (5,3)\n\nAt (3,3), no food.\n\nMoves from (3,3): U to (3,4), D to (3,2), L to (2,3), R to (4,3) but (4,3) is body, collision.\n\nR is to (4,3), body, so invalid.\n\nL to (2,3), not wall.\n\nU to (3,4), not wall.\n\nD to (3,2), not wall.\n\nNew direction L.\n\nNow, food at (3,5) is close to (3,3), only 2 steps up: from (3,3) to (3,4) to (3,5).\n\nSimilarly, (2,4) is at (2,4), from (3,3) can go to (3,4) or (2,3) etc.\n\nBut (3,5) has short life span, only until turn 9, so I might want to eat it soon.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) is at (1,2), which is down and left.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should eat the food with short life first if possible.\n\n(3,5) can be reached in 2 moves from (3,3), which I can reach in one move by going L to (3,3) now.\n\nFrom current position, if I go L to (3,3) on turn 7, then on turn 8 I can go U to (3,4), then on turn 9 I can go U to (3,5) to eat it.\n\nLife span of (3,5) is 3 at turn 7, so on turn 8 it will be span 2, present; turn 9 span 1, present; so I can eat it on turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, if I don't, it might disappear.\n\n(1,2) also short life.\n\nBut (1,2) is farther.\n\nNow, let's consider the path.\n\nFirst, if I move L to (3,3) on turn 7.\n\nThen turn 7: move L to (3,3), head at (3,3), body (4,3), tail (5,3)\n\nNo food eaten.\n\nTurn 8: from (3,3), I can move U to (3,4) for example.\n\nThen head to (3,4), body (3,3), tail (4,3) — positions: head (3,4), then previous head (3,3) body, and tail (4,3)\n\nAt (3,4), no food? Food at (2,4) is (2,4), not (3,4).\n\nThen on turn 9, from (3,4), move U to (3,5) to eat food.\n\nMove to (3,5), which has food, so eat it, then snake grows: new head at (3,5), previous head (3,4) becomes body, and since food eaten, the tail does not move, so new positions: head (3,5), body (3,4), and the previous body (3,3) and tail (4,3) remain, so snake now: [ (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3) ], length 4.\n\nLife span of (3,5) was 3 at turn 7, on turn 9 it is span 1, eaten, so ok.\n\nNow, after that, I have snake at (3,5), head, direction U.\n\nThen I can go to other food.\n\nBut there is a wall at (4,6), which is above.\n\n(3,5) to (4,6) is not direct, but (4,6) is wall, so I need to avoid.\n\nAlso, food at (2,4) is nearby, at (2,4).\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move L to (2,5), D to (3,4) but (3,4) is body, etc.\n\nBut let's not plan too far.\n\nAnother option: if on turn 7 I move U to (4,4).\n\nThen head at (4,4), body (4,3), tail (5,3)\n\nThen turn 8, from (4,4), I can move U to (4,5), for example.\n\n(4,5) is not wall, no food.\n\nThen turn 9, from (4,5), I can move U to (4,6), but (4,6) is wall! Internal obstacle, so deadly.\n\nCannot move to (4,6).\n\nFrom (4,5), I can move L to (3,5) to eat food, but (3,5) is at (3,5), which is left.\n\nFrom (4,5), move L to (3,5): but (3,5) is food, so I can go there on turn 9 if I set it up.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nIf turn 7: move U to (4,4)\n\nTurn 8: from (4,4), move L to (3,4)? (3,4) is empty, no food.\n\nThen head to (3,4), body (4,4), tail (4,3) — positions: head (3,4), body (4,4), tail (4,3)? After move to (3,4): head (3,4), previous head (4,4) body, and previous body (4,3) tail? Let's track.\n\nAfter turn 7: positions [ (4,4), (4,3), (5,3) ] head at (4,4)\n\nTurn 8: move to (3,4), new head (3,4), then (4,4) becomes body, and (4,3) becomes tail. (5,3) is gone.\n\nPositions: [ (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) ]\n\nAt (3,4), no food.\n\nThen turn 9: from (3,4), move U to (3,5) to eat food.\n\nMove to (3,5), eat, so new head (3,5), body (3,4), and since food eaten, tail stays, so previous tail (4,3) remains, positions: [ (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) ]? After eating: head at (3,5), the segment that was head (3,4) becomes body, and the body segments remain, no tail removed, so snake grows to length 4: [ (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3) ].\n\nBut (4,3) is the tail.\n\nNow, compared to moving directly left, I get to (3,5) on turn 9 as well, but with an extra move to (4,4) and (3,4), so I wasted a move, and the snake is in a different position.\n\nFrom current, if I go directly L on turn 7 to (3,3), then U to (3,4) on turn 8, U to (3,5) on turn 9.\n\nIf I go U to (4,4) on turn 7, then I need to go to (3,4) or something to reach (3,5) on turn 9, but it might take more turns.\n\nFor example, from (4,4) on turn 8, I can go directly to (3,5)? (3,5) is left and up from (4,4)? (4,4) to (3,5): dx=1 left, dy=1 up, but moves are only up, down, left, right, not diagonal. So I need to move left then up, or up then left, etc. Cannot move diagonal.\n\nSo from (4,4), to reach (3,5), I need two moves, e.g., U to (4,5) then L to (3,5), or L to (3,4) then U to (3,5).\n\nBut (4,5) is available, then to (3,5).\n\nBut on turn 8, if I go to (4,5), then on turn 9 go to (3,5) to eat.\n\nBut (3,5) life span: on turn 9, it should be present, span was 3 at turn 7, turn 8 span 2, turn 9 span 1, so yes.\n\nBut if I go to (4,5) on turn 8, then (4,5) to (3,5) on turn 9.\n\nBut from (4,4), moving to (4,5) is up, then to (3,5) is left.\n\nNo problem.\n\nBut in this case, I eat on turn 9, same as before.\n\nBut with the direct left move, I start from closer.\n\nNow, what about moving down to (4,2) on turn 7.\n\nThen head at (4,2), body (4,3), tail (5,3)\n\nFood at (1,2) is at (1,2), which is left and down? (4,2) to (1,2): need to go left three times, but there might be obstacles.\n\nFrom (4,2), I can move L to (3,2), then to (2,2), then to (1,2).\n\nBut (1,2) life span: must be eaten by turn 9.\n\nOn turn 7, if I go to (4,2), turn 8 to (3,2), turn 9 to (2,2), not to (1,2) yet; I need turn 10 to (1,2), but on turn 10, (1,2) is gone, span 0.\n\nLife span: turn 7 span 3, present turn 7,8,9; gone turn 10.\n\nSo to eat on turn 9, I need to be at (1,2) on turn 9.\n\nFrom current turn 7, if I go directly to (1,2) in two moves? From (4,3) to (1,2): dx=3, dy=1, min 4 moves, since no diagonal.\n\nFor example: L to (3,3) on turn 7, then L to (2,3) on turn 8, then D to (2,2) on turn 9, but (2,2) to (1,2) is another move, turn 10, too late.\n\nFrom (4,3), D to (4,2) on turn 7, then L to (3,2) on turn 8, then L to (2,2) on turn 9, not (1,2).\n\nTo reach (1,2) on turn 9, I need to start moving left/down immediately.\n\nBut from (4,3), on turn 7, if I move L to (3,3), then turn 8 move D to (3,2), then turn 9 move L to (2,2), still not (1,2); (1,2) requires another move.\n\nFrom (4,3), move D to (4,2) on turn 7, then on turn 8 move L to (3,2), then on turn 9 move L to (2,2), same issue.\n\nThe only way to reach (1,2) by turn 9 is if I can do it in two moves, but from (4,3) to (1,2) is at least 3 moves: e.g., L to (3,3), D to (3,2), L to (2,2) on turn 9, but (2,2) not (1,2); need another L to (1,2) on turn 10.\n\nBut turn 10 too late.\n\nPerhaps from current position, but it's impossible to reach (1,2) by turn 9 with the snake.\n\nCurrent to (1,2): min Manhattan distance 4 (dx=3, dy=1), so at least 4 moves needed, but turns: to be on the cell on turn t, I need to arrive on that turn.\n\nTo eat on turn 9, I need to move to (1,2) on turn 9.\n\nFrom turn 7, I have two moves: turn 7 and turn 8 to get closer, then turn 9 to (1,2).\n\nAfter two moves, I can be at, say, (2,2) or (1,3), but (1,3) might be wall? y=3 not border, x=1 not border, but (1,3) is not wall, I think.\n\nx=1, y=3: x=1 not 0 or 7, y=3 not 0 or 7, not (4,6), so ok.\n\nFrom (4,3), turn 7 move L to (3,3), then turn 8 move L to (2,3), then turn 9 move D to (2,2), but (2,2) not (1,2).\n\n(1,2) is at (1,2).\n\nFrom (2,3) on turn 8, I can move L to (1,3) on turn 8? Turn 8 move from (2,3) to (1,3), then turn 9 move D to (1,2).\n\nBut from current turn 7, I need to reach a position where I can go to (1,2) on turn 9.\n\nSo on turn 8, I need to be at a cell adjacent to (1,2), like (1,1), (1,3), (0,2), (2,2).\n\n(0,2) is wall, x=0.\n\n(1,1) and (1,3) and (2,2).\n\nNow, from current (4,3), after one move on turn 7, I can be at (3,3), (4,4), or (4,2).\n\nFrom (3,3), I can go to (2,3) or (3,4) or (3,2) on turn 8.\n\nThen from there, to adjacent to (1,2) on turn 9.\n\nFor example, from (3,3) turn 7, turn 8 move L to (2,3), then turn 9 move D to (2,2), but (2,2) not adjacent to (1,2)? (2,2) and (1,2) are adjacent, left.\n\n(2,2) to (1,2) is left, one move.\n\nOn turn 9, from (2,2) move L to (1,2) to eat.\n\nBut on turn 9, (1,2) is still present, span 1.\n\nBut from (2,2) to (1,2) on turn 9.\n\nNow, can I reach (2,2) by turn 8? No, by turn 9 position.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 7: move from (4,3) to, say, (3,3) by L.\n\nThen turn 8: from (3,3) move L to (2,3) or move D to (3,2).\n\nIf move L to (2,3) on turn 8, then positions: head (2,3), body (3,3), tail (4,3) — after move, head (2,3), body (3,3), tail (4,3)? Previous: after turn 7, positions [ (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) ] head (3,3)\n\nTurn 8 move to (2,3): new head (2,3), body (3,3), tail (4,3)\n\nThen turn 9: from (2,3) move D to (2,2), then eat? (2,2) no food, but then from (2,2) to (1,2) on turn 10, too late.\n\nTo eat on turn 9, I need to move directly to (1,2) on turn 9.\n\nSo on turn 9, head at (1,2).\n\nTherefore, on turn 8, head must be at a cell adjacent to (1,2), so (1,1), (1,3), or (2,2).\n\n(0,2) wall.\n\nNow, from turn 7 position, after move, where can I be.\n\nTurn 7 move: from (4,3), I can go to (3,3), (4,4), or (4,2).\n\nIf to (3,3), then on turn 8, I can go to (3,4), (3,2), (2,3), (4,3) but (4,3) may be body.\n\nFrom (3,3), moves: U (3,4), D (3,2), L (2,3), R (4,3) but (4,3) is body after turn 7 move? After turn 7 move to (3,3), positions [ (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) ], so (4,3) is body, not tail, so moving to (4,3) causes collision.\n\nSo from (3,3) on turn 8, can go to (3,4), (3,2), or (2,3).\n\nNone of these are adjacent to (1,2). (3,4) is up, (3,2) down, (2,3) left but (2,3) to (1,2) is not adjacent; (2,3) and (1,2) are diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent cells to (1,2) are (1,1), (1,3), (0,2) wall, (2,2).\n\n(2,3) is not adjacent to (1,2).\n\nIf from (3,3) on turn 8, I go to (2,3), then on turn 9, from (2,3) I can go to (2,2) or (2,4) or (1,3) or (3,3) but (3,3) body.\n\n(1,3) is adjacent to (1,2), yes.\n\nFrom (2,3) on turn 9, move L to (1,3), but (1,3) is not (1,2), I need to be at (1,2) to eat.\n\nTo eat on turn 9, I must move to (1,2) on turn 9.\n\nSo on turn 9, head at (1,2).\n\nTherefore, on turn 8, head must be at a neighbor of (1,2): (1,1), (1,3), or (2,2).\n\nNow, from turn 7, after move, where can I be on turn 7 end.\n\nTurn 7: from (4,3) move to (3,3), (4,4), or (4,2).\n\nIf to (3,3), then on turn 8, from (3,3) I can go to (3,2) or (2,3) or (3,4).\n\n(3,2) is at (3,2), which is not a neighbor of (1,2). Neighbors are (1,1), (1,3), (2,2).\n\n(3,2) to (2,2) is adjacent, but (2,2) is a neighbor of (1,2), but on turn 8, if I go to (3,2), I am not at a neighbor.\n\nSimilarly, from (3,3) to (2,3) on turn 8, (2,3) not neighbor.\n\nNone of the positions I can reach from (3,3) on turn 8 are neighbors of (1,2).\n\nSimilarly, if I move to (4,4) on turn 7, even farther.\n\nIf I move to (4,2) on turn 7, then on turn 8 from (4,2) I can go to (4,1), (3,2), (5,2), or (4,3) but (4,3) body.\n\n(3,2) is possible, but (3,2) not neighbor of (1,2).\n\n(2,2) is neighbor, but I can't reach (2,2) from (4,2) in one move; min distance.\n\nSo it is impossible to reach (1,2) by turn 9 to eat it, because it requires at least 3 moves from current position, and I only have 2 moves before turn 9.\n\nFrom turn 7 to turn 9, I have two moves: turn 7 and turn 8, to change position, then on turn 9 I move to the food.\n\nBut from (4,3) to (1,2) is 3 steps away in Manhattan, so I need three moves to reach it, so earliest I can be at (1,2) is turn 10, when it is gone.\n\nTherefore, (1,2) cannot be eaten; it will disappear without being eaten.\n\nSimilarly, for (3,5), it can be eaten on turn 9.\n\n(3,5) is at (3,5), from current (4,3), I can be at (3,3) on turn 7 with L move, then (3,4) on turn 8, then (3,5) on turn 9.\n\n(3,3) to (3,4) to (3,5).\n\nYes, as I thought earlier.\n\nIf I go other ways, but this is efficient.\n\nNow, (6,5) has longer life, so I can get it later.\n\n(2,4) also long life.\n\nBut (3,5) is the one I can get soon.\n\nNow, back to turn 7 move.\n\nIf I move L to (3,3), I can get to (3,5) on turn 9.\n\nIf I move U to (4,4), I can still get to (3,5) but with more moves or same, but I might not be able to if I go up.\n\nFor example, from (4,4), to (3,5) requires two moves, like to (4,5) then (3,5), but (4,5) to (3,5) on turn 9.\n\nBut from (4,4) on turn 8, move U to (4,5), then turn 9 move L to (3,5), eat.\n\nSame turn 9.\n\nBut from current, moving U on turn 7 to (4,4), then I have to go to (4,5) or (3,4) first.\n\nWhereas moving L directly is more straightforward.\n\nMoreover, moving U might lead to dead ends near the wall.\n\nFor example, (4,6) is wall, so above row is dangerous.\n\ny=5 and y=6, but y=6 has wall at (4,6), but other cells might be ok, but need to be careful.\n\n(4,5) is ok, but (4,6) is wall.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can go to (3,5) or (5,5), etc.\n\nBut moving left seems better to get the food.\n\nNow, what about the other food, (2,4) at (2,4).\n\nAfter eating (3,5), I can go to (2,4).\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) at (6,5), which is on the right.\n\nBut snake is small, so eating is good.\n\nAlso, long-term survival: I need to avoid boxing myself in.\n\nCurrently, with move L to (3,3), then to (3,4), then to (3,5).\n\nAfter eating at (3,5), snake at (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3) as before.\n\nThen from (3,5), I can move L to (2,5), or D to (3,4) but (3,4) is body, so cannot, or U to (3,6), but y=6, (3,6) is not border? y=6, not 0 or 7, so not border wall, but internal walls only (4,6), so (3,6) should be empty.\n\nx=3, y=6: not x=0,7 or y=0,7, and not (4,6), so ok.\n\nSimilarly, R to (4,5), etc.\n\n(2,4) is at (2,4), which is down and left from (3,5).\n\nFrom (3,5), move L to (2,5), then D to (2,4), for example.\n\n(2,4) has long life span, so no rush.\n\nSimilarly, I could go to (6,5) later.\n\nBut there might be risks.\n\nAnother thing: the tail reward danger.\n\nBut in this path, when I eat at (3,5), the head is at (3,5), and the tail is at (4,3), which is not adjacent; far away.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nNow, if I move down to (4,2) on turn 7, then I might not get the short-life food, and I have to go for (2,4) or something.\n\nBut (2,4) has long life, so I can get it later.\n\nBut missing (3,5) means losing a point, since it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) is impossible.\n\nSo best to eat (3,5).\n\nTherefore, on turn 7, move L to (3,3).\n\nThen turn 8, move U to (3,4) to get closer to (3,5).\n\nThen turn 9, move U to (3,5) to eat.\n\nNow, after that, I need to plan further turns.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions for several turns.\n\nThe format is to output for turn 7, 8, 9, etc.\n\nBut how many? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but output as many as reasonable, I think.\n\nSince it's turn 7, I can output for turn 7 to say turn 11 or 12.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFirst, on turn 7: move L to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 8: from (3,3), move U to (3,4) — I need to specify action.\n\nIn the sequence.\n\nAfter turn 9, snake at (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3)\n\nHead direction U (since last move up).\n\nNow, possible moves: from (3,5), U to (3,6), D to (3,4) but (3,4) is body, collision, L to (2,5), R to (4,5)\n\nCannot move D or opposite? Opposite of U is D, which is invalid anyway.\n\nSo can move U, L, R.\n\nNow, food at (2,4) is at (2,4), which is down and left.\n\nI can go L to (2,5), then from there, move D to (2,4) to eat.\n\n(2,4) life span 10, so plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly, food at (6,5) at (6,5), which is right.\n\nBut I might want to eat (2,4) first since it's closer.\n\nAfter eating (3,5), on turn 10, I can move L to (2,5), for example.\n\nThen turn 11, move D to (2,4) to eat.\n\nBut let's list the actions.\n\nAlso, consider if moving U to (3,6) is safe.\n\n(3,6): y=6, not wall, but above is y=7 wall, and (4,6) is wall to the right, but (3,6) should be ok.\n\nThen from there, I can go left or down, but (2,4) is below, so going down might be better.\n\nBut let's not complicate.\n\nSince I have to output actions, let's define a sequence.\n\nTurn 7: move L to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 8: from (3,3), move U to (3,4)  // towards (3,5)\n\nTurn 9: move U to (3,5) and eat food. Now snake length 4, positions: head (3,5), body (3,4), body (3,3), tail (4,3)\n\nNow turn 10: from (3,5), move L to (2,5)  // towards (2,4)\n\n(2,5) is not food, empty.\n\nPositions: move to (2,5), no food, so new head (2,5), body (3,5), body (3,4), tail (3,3) — since no food, tail (4,3) removed, and (3,3) becomes tail.\n\nAfter move: head (2,5), previous head (3,5) becomes body, previous body (3,4) body, previous body (3,3) becomes tail. (4,3) is gone.\n\nSnake: [ (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3) ]\n\nNow, (2,4) is at (2,4), below.\n\nTurn 11: from (2,5), move D to (2,4) to eat food.\n\nMove to (2,4), eat, so grow: new head (2,4), body (2,5), and previous segments remain, so snake: [ (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3) ] length 5.\n\nNow, after that, I can go to other food, like (6,5).\n\nBut (6,5) is at (6,5), far right.\n\nNow, from (2,4), head at (2,4), direction D (since moved down).\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,5) but (2,5) is now body, collision; D to (2,3), L to (1,4), R to (3,4) but (3,4) is body.\n\n(3,4) is body in the snake, so cannot move there.\n\nAvailable: D to (2,3), L to (1,4), R to (3,4) invalid, U invalid.\n\nL to (1,4), or D to (2,3).\n\n(1,4) might be towards left, but borders.\n\nx=1, y=4 not wall.\n\n(2,3) down.\n\nNow, food at (6,5), but far, and I need to avoid walls.\n\nAlso, there might be no other food soon, but I can survive.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should go towards (6,5).\n\nBut it might take many turns.\n\nSince I have to output actions, perhaps I can output up to turn 11 or so.\n\nBut let's see the life span: (6,5) life span 7 at turn 7, so on turn 14 it disappears, so I have time.\n\nSimilarly, no rush.\n\nBut for the sequence, I can stop after a few moves.\n\nPerhaps for now, I can output turns 7 to 11.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nTurn 7: L\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U (eat at (3,5))\n\nTurn 10: L (to (2,5))\n\nTurn 11: D (to (2,4) and eat)\n\nThen turn 12: from (2,4), I can move L to (1,4) or D to (2,3), etc.\n\nBut I don't need to specify further, or I can.\n\nThe problem says to think 5+ turns ahead, so for turn 7, thinking ahead to turn 12.\n\nIn terms of actions, I have from turn 7 to 11, that's 5 actions: t7,t8,t9,t10,t11.\n\nt7 to t11 is 5 turns.\n\nt7, t8, t9, t10, t11: that's 5 actions.\n\nBut thinking ahead means simulating the future, not necessarily outputting all.\n\nBut in the answer format, I need to output the actions.\n\nPerhaps I should output a sequence of actions starting from current turn.\n\nNow, another thing: when I moved to (2,5) on turn 10, is there any risk?\n\n(2,5) is fine.\n\nThen to (2,4) on turn 11.\n\nNow, after eating at (2,4), snake at (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)\n\nHead at (2,4), direction D.\n\nNow, tail at (3,3).\n\nI can move, say, D to (2,3) or L to (1,4).\n\nIf I move L to (1,4), then towards left, but x=0 is wall, so I might get stuck.\n\nBetter to move down or right.\n\nMove D to (2,3), for example.\n\nThen to (2,2), etc., but no food.\n\nSince (6,5) is food, I should head right.\n\nFrom (2,4), move R to (3,4), but (3,4) is body, cannot.\n\nAvailable moves: only D to (2,3) or L to (1,4).\n\nL to (1,4) then I can go to (1,3), (1,2) but (1,2) gone, etc., might be dead end.\n\nD to (2,3) then to (2,2), (2,1), etc., but borders.\n\nBetter to go up or something.\n\nFrom (2,4), I can only move D or L.\n\nAfter moving D to (2,3) on turn 12.\n\nThen positions: head (2,3), body (2,4), tail (3,3)? After move: head (2,3), body (2,4), and the segments: previous body (2,5) becomes? Snake was [ (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3) ]\n\nAfter move to (2,3), no food, so new head (2,3), body (2,4), body (2,5), body (3,5), tail (3,4). (3,3) removed.\n\nPositions: [ (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4) ]\n\nNow from (2,3), can move U to (2,4) but body, invalid; D to (2,2), L to (1,3), R to (3,3) which is empty now? (3,3) was removed, so empty.\n\n(3,3) is free.\n\nSo can move R to (3,3) or D to (2,2) or L to (1,3).\n\nThen I can go to (3,3), then to (4,3), etc., towards right.\n\nSo it's ok.\n\nBut in the sequence, for the answer, I can output up to turn 11.\n\nNow, but in turn 7, if I move down or up, it might not be optimal.\n\nFor example, if I move D to (4,2) on turn 7.\n\nThen I can go to (2,4) or something.\n\n(2,4) is at (2,4), from (4,2), I can go left and up.\n\nFor instance, turn 7: D to (4,2)\n\nThen turn 8: from (4,2) move L to (3,2)\n\nThen turn 9: move L to (2,2)\n\nThen turn 10: move U to (2,3)? Not to food.\n\n(2,4) is at (2,4), so from (2,2) to (2,3) to (2,4) on turn 11.\n\nBut (2,4) can be eaten later, no problem, but I miss (3,5) which disappears on turn 10.\n\n(3,5) gone on turn 10, so if I don't eat by turn 9, I lose it.\n\nWith this path, I don't eat (3,5), so worse.\n\nSimilarly, if I move U first, I might eat (3,5) but with extra moves.\n\nBut moving L directly is best.\n\nSo I think turn 7 L, turn 8 U, turn 9 U is good.\n\nThen turn 10 L to (2,5), turn 11 D to (2,4) to eat.\n\nFor turn 12, I can add, but not necessary.\n\nThe answer should be in the boxed format.\n\nAlso, need to consider if the food under body can be eaten, but in this case, no food under body.\n\nFor example, if food was under body, but here not.\n\nSo for now.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, the strategy focuses on eating the positive food at (3,5) before it disappears (life span 3 at turn 7, so it must be eaten by turn 9). The snake starts at (4,3) with direction left. Moving left to (3,3) on turn 7 is optimal, as it positions the snake closer to (3,5) and avoids risks. From (3,3), moving up to (3,4) on turn 8 sets up the move to (3,5) on turn 9 to eat the food. After eating, the snake grows to length 4.\n\nNext, the snake targets the food at (2,4), which has a long life span (10 turns), allowing flexibility. From (3,5), moving left to (2,5) on turn 10 avoids body collisions and positions the snake to move down to (2,4) on turn 11 to eat the food, growing to length 5. This path avoids walls and body collisions, and the food at (1,2) is ignored as it is impossible to reach by turn 9 (requires at least 3 moves from turn 7, but it disappears after turn 9).\n\nBeyond turn 11, the snake can head towards (6,5) for another point, but it has a long life span (7 turns), so there is no rush. The actions up to turn 11 prioritize immediate opportunities while maintaining safe positions. Thinking 5+ turns ahead confirms this sequence maximizes score by securing short-life food first and avoids dead ends (e.g., near the wall at (4,6)).\n\n**Action Sequence:**\n- Turn 7: Move L (left) to (3,3) – positions snake closer to (3,5) and avoids reverse move.\n- Turn 8: Move U (up) to (3,4) – continues toward (3,5) with no collision risk.\n- Turn 9: Move U (up) to (3,5) – eats food, snake grows to length 4; new positions: head (3,5), body (3,4), (3,3), tail (4,3).\n- Turn 10: Move L (left) to (2,5) – moves toward (2,4) safely; new positions: head (2,5), body (3,5), (3,4), tail (3,3).\n- Turn 11: Move D (down) to (2,4) – eats food, snake grows to length 5; new positions: head (2,4), body (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), tail (3,3).\n\nThis sequence scores 2 points by turns 9 and 11 and ensures the snake remains in open areas for future moves to (6,5).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 7: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 8: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 9: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 10: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 11: D (down)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 8, and I'm playing Snake on a grid with walls and obstacles. The grid size isn't specified, but from the walls, it seems like a 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates probably range from (0,0) to (7,7). Internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: head at (3,3), then body at (4,3), and tail at (5,3). So the snake is horizontal, facing left, since head direction is L. That means it's moving left, so from (3,3) to (4,3) to (5,3), but head is at (3,3), and it's moving left, so next position would be left of (3,3).\n\nHead direction is L, so current movement is left. Positions: [(3,3), (4,3), (5,3)]. Since it's moving left, the head was previously at (4,3) or something? Let's think about the movement.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the head goes to a new cell, and the tail moves, so the body segments follow. But for direction, head direction L means it's currently going left.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (1,2) with life span 2, value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (3,5) with life span 2, value 1\n\n- (6,5) with life span 6, value 1\n\n- (2,4) with life span 9, value 1\n\nAll food has value 1, so all positive, no negative food mentioned. Value 1 means +1 point and snake grows by one when eaten.\n\nLife span: for (1,2), life span 2, which means it disappears after 2 turns including current turn? The description says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", and \"disappears after N turns\". So for (1,2), life span 2 at turn 8, so it will disappear after turn 9? Let's clarify.\n\nIt says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\", and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, if life span is L, it decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears. So at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after L more turns, meaning it lasts until turn t + L - 1? I need to be careful.\n\nExample: at turn 8, food has life span 2. Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 8, life span is 2. After turn 8, countdown becomes 1. At turn 9, countdown becomes 0, and it disappears after turn 9? Or at the end of turn?\n\nTypically, the food is present during the turn it has life span >0. So at turn t, if life span S, it is present. After the turn, S decreases by 1. So at turn t, S = k, it will be present for k turns including this one, so it disappears at the start of turn t+k or something.\n\nThe description says: \"disappears after N turns\", and N is life_span at spawn.\n\nBut here, life span is given at current turn.\n\nFor (1,2): life span 2 at turn 8. So after this turn (turn 8), it decreases to 1. At turn 9, it decreases to 0 and disappears, so it can be eaten on turn 8 or 9, but not after.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) life span 2, same as above.\n\n(6,5) life span 6, so it will last until turn 13? Let's calculate:\n\nTurn 8: life span 6, present\n\nAfter turn 8: life span 5\n\nTurn 9: life span 5, present\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 13: life span 0, disappears before turn 14.\n\nGenerally, food with life span L at turn t can be eaten from turn t to turn t + L - 1 inclusive.\n\nFor (1,2): L=2 at t=8, can be eaten on turn 8 or 9.\n\n(3,5): L=2, turn 8 or 9.\n\n(6,5): L=6, turn 8 to 13.\n\n(2,4): L=9, turn 8 to 16.\n\nNow, snake is at [(3,3), (4,3), (5,3)], head at (3,3), direction left.\n\nPossible moves: since head direction is L (left), I can move left, up, or down, but not right because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nCurrent direction is L, so opposite is R, so I cannot move right. I can move L (continue left), U (up), or D (down).\n\nNow, let's see the grid. Walls: border at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7).\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nFood at (1,2), (3,5), (6,5), (2,4).\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival and maximize score.\n\nFirst, let's map the current position.\n\nHead at (3,3). Moving left would go to (2,3). Is (2,3) safe?\n\n(2,3) is within bounds, not a wall. Is it occupied by body? Snake body: (4,3) and (5,3), so (2,3) is empty. Food? No food at (2,3), food is at (1,2), (3,5), etc.\n\nMoving up from (3,3) to (3,4)? y+1 is up? Direction: U is (x,y+1), so y increases up, I assume? Typically in grids, y=0 at bottom or top? The problem doesn't specify, but usually in such games, y=0 is bottom or top? Let's see.\n\nIt says U (x,y+1), and walls at y=0 and y=7. Snake positions given as (x,y), no specification, but since it's a grid, I'll assume y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top, so U increases y, moving up.\n\nSimilarly, D decreases y, moving down.\n\nIn the food, (3,5) is at y=5, which is higher, so likely y=0 bottom, y=7 top.\n\nSo from (3,3):\n\n- Left: (2,3)\n\n- Up: (3,4)\n\n- Down: (3,2)\n\n- Right not allowed.\n\nNow, (3,2): is it wall? y=2, not y=0, so not wall. x=3, not border. No internal obstacle mentioned except (4,6). So (3,2) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) free, (3,4) free.\n\nNow, after moving, the snake grows only if it eats food. If no food, tail moves, length same.\n\nCurrent length 3.\n\nNow, I need to plan multiple moves ahead.\n\nFirst, let's list possible actions for turn 8.\n\nI can choose L, U, or D.\n\nBut I have to think about future turns.\n\nAlso, there's a special rule about tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because of collision.\n\nBut in this state, tail is at (5,3), and there's no food on tail or anything. Food is elsewhere.\n\nThe tail cell doesn't have food; food positions are separate.\n\nSo no immediate danger.\n\nNow, let's consider the food that is expiring soon: (1,2) and (3,5) both have life span 2, so they disappear after turn 9, meaning must be eaten by turn 9 at latest.\n\nTurn 8 or 9.\n\n(1,2) and (3,5) are both at life span 2.\n\n(1,2) is at (1,2), which is left and down from head (3,3).\n\n(3,5) is at (3,5), which is up from head (3,3), since y=5 vs y=3, so U then U again or something.\n\n(3,5) is directly above (3,3) at same x, y=5.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (3,5) is up two steps.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) is at x=1,y=2, from (3,3), that's left to (2,3) then to (1,3) or down to (1,2)? (1,2) is left and down.\n\n(3,3) to (1,2): delta x=-2, delta y=-1, so not straight.\n\nAlso, (2,4) food at (2,4), which is left and up from (3,3).\n\n(6,5) is at (6,5), which is right and up, but right is not allowed immediately.\n\nNow, since (1,2) and (3,5) are expiring soon, I might want to go for them.\n\nBut (3,5) is closer: from (3,3), if I go up to (3,4), then I can go to (3,5) next turn if I go up again.\n\n(3,5) is at (3,5), which is adjacent up? From (3,3) to (3,4) is adjacent up, but (3,5) is one more up, so not adjacent directly.\n\nHead at (3,3), adjacent cells: (2,3) left, (4,3) right but not allowed, (3,4) up, (3,2) down.\n\n(3,5) is not adjacent; it's two cells away.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) is not adjacent.\n\nNow, if I move up to (3,4) on turn 8, then on turn 9 I can move up to (3,5) and eat the food there, since (3,5) has food with life span 2, and on turn 9 it can be eaten (life span decreases after turn, so on turn 9 it has life span 1, still present).\n\nSimilarly, if I go left to (2,3) on turn 8, then to (1,3) or (1,2), but (1,2) is below, so I need to go down.\n\nLet's list possible paths.\n\nFirst, option: go for (3,5) food.\n\nTurn 8: move U to (3,4)\n\nThen turn 9: move U to (3,5), eat food, snake grows to length 4.\n\nAfter eating, new head at (3,5), body at (3,4), (4,3), (5,3)? When head moves to (3,5) and eats, the tail doesn't move, so snake becomes [(3,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,3)]? Positions: before move, snake is [(3,3), (4,3), (5,3)]\n\nTurn 8: move U to (3,4), so new head at (3,4), and since no food eaten (assuming (3,4) has no food), tail moves from (5,3) to? When moving, if no food, head moves to new cell, tail leaves the last cell.\n\nSo turn 8: move U to (3,4), no food at (3,4), so snake now [(3,4), (3,3), (4,3)]? Head to (3,4), then body segments follow: the first body segment was at (3,3), now moves to where head was? Standard snake: the body follows the path.\n\nInitial: positions [H, B1, B2] = [(3,3), (4,3), (5,3)]\n\nAfter move U: head to (3,4), so new positions: head (3,4), then the previous head (3,3) becomes body, so [ (3,4), (3,3), (4,3) ], and tail (5,3) is left, so snake is now length 3: [(3,4), (3,3), (4,3)]\n\n(4,3) was B1, now it's tail.\n\nThen turn 9: move U to (3,5). (3,5) has food, so eat it. Head moves to (3,5), food eaten, so tail does not move. Snake grows to length 4: new head (3,5), then previous body: (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), so positions [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3)]\n\nYes.\n\nNow, at this point, head at (3,5), direction U (since moved up twice).\n\nNow, what about other food? (1,2) is at life span 2, turn 8 and 9. After turn 8, if I didn't go for it, on turn 9 it might be gone if not eaten.\n\nIn this path, on turn 8 I moved to (3,4), not towards (1,2), so (1,2) might expire.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) is eaten on turn 9.\n\nNow, after that, I need to plan further.\n\nBut let's not get ahead; first for turn 8.\n\nAnother option: go for (1,2) food.\n\n(1,2) at (1,2). From head (3,3), I can go left to (2,3) on turn 8.\n\nThen from (2,3), I can go down to (2,2) or left to (1,3), but (1,2) is at (1,2), so to reach (1,2) from (2,3), I need to go left to (1,3) then down to (1,2), or down to (2,2) then left to (1,2), etc.\n\nShortest: turn 8: L to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 9: from (2,3), I can go D to (2,2), but (1,2) is at (1,2), not (2,2). (2,2) is empty, I think.\n\nThen to reach (1,2), I need to go left from (2,2) to (1,2) on turn 10, but (1,2) life span 2 at turn 8, so on turn 9 it has life span 1, can be eaten on turn 9, but on turn 10 it might be gone.\n\nLife span: at turn 8, life span 2, so after turn 8, it decreases to 1, present on turn 9. After turn 9, it decreases to 0, disappears, so cannot be eaten on turn 10.\n\nSo to eat (1,2), I must be on (1,2) on turn 8 or 9.\n\nSimilarly for (3,5) on turn 8 or 9.\n\nNow, from (3,3), on turn 8, if I go directly to (1,2), but it's not adjacent; I can only move one cell per turn.\n\nSo impossible to reach (1,2) on turn 8 from (3,3); only adjacent moves.\n\nAdjacent cells are (2,3), (3,4), (3,2), (4,3) not allowed.\n\nNone of which is (1,2), so I cannot eat (1,2) on turn 8.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) not adjacent.\n\nSo for (1,2), I need to reach it by turn 9.\n\nFrom (3,3), on turn 8, I can move to a position from which I can reach (1,2) on turn 9.\n\nFor example, if I move to (2,3) on turn 8, then from (2,3) on turn 9, I can move down to (2,2) or left to (1,3), but (1,2) is at (1,2), which is adjacent to (1,3) or (2,2), but not to (2,3) directly.\n\n(2,3) to (1,2): not adjacent, since |dx|=1, |dy|=1, diagonal, not orthogonal, so not directly reachable in one move.\n\nMoves are only orthogonal: U,D,L,R.\n\nSo from (2,3), I can go to (1,3) left, (3,3) right, (2,4) up, or (2,2) down.\n\n(1,2) is adjacent to (1,3) and (2,2), but not to (2,3).\n\nSo to be able to move to (1,2) on turn 9, I need to be on an adjacent cell on turn 8, like (1,3) or (2,2) or (1,1) or (0,2) but (0,2) is wall, x=0 wall.\n\nWalls at x=0, so (0,2) invalid.\n\n(1,1) is y=1, not wall.\n\nBut from current position, how to be on (1,3) or (2,2) on turn 8.\n\nFrom (3,3), turn 8: if I move left to (2,3), then on turn 8 I am at (2,3), which is not adjacent to (1,2); (1,2) is adjacent to (2,2) south, (1,3) north, (0,2) west wall, (1,1) south? Coordinates: let's define.\n\nAssume (x,y), x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\n(1,2) adjacent: left (0,2) wall, right (2,2), up (1,3), down (1,1).\n\n(2,2) is right and down? From (1,2), right is (2,2), up is (1,3), etc.\n\nTo move to (1,2) on turn 9, I need to be on (2,2), (1,3), or (1,1) on turn 8.\n\nFrom current head (3,3), on turn 8, I can move to (2,3) left, or (3,2) down, or (3,4) up.\n\n(2,3) is at (2,3), which is not (2,2) or (1,3).\n\n(3,2) is at (3,2), not adjacent to (1,2).\n\n(3,4) is at (3,4), far.\n\nSo from (2,3) on turn 8, I can on turn 9 move to (2,2) down or (1,3) left.\n\nThen from (2,2) or (1,3), I can move to (1,2) on turn 9? From (2,2), moving left to (1,2) is possible. From (1,3), moving down to (1,2) is possible.\n\nBut on turn 9, I move to (1,2) and eat it.\n\nBut turn 9 is the last chance for (1,2), since it disappears after.\n\nSimilarly, for (3,5), from (3,3), if I move up to (3,4) on turn 8, then on turn 9 to (3,5).\n\nNow, back to turn 8 choices.\n\nI have three options:\n\n1. Move U to (3,4) - to go towards (3,5)\n\n2. Move L to (2,3) - to go towards (1,2) or other\n\n3. Move D to (3,2) - not towards any immediate food, but there's (2,4) or others.\n\nAlso, (2,4) food at (2,4), life span 9, so plenty of time.\n\n(6,5) at (6,5), life span 6, also time.\n\nBut (1,2) and (3,5) are urgent.\n\nNow, if I go for (3,5), I can eat it on turn 9, as above.\n\nIf I go for (1,2), I need to be on (2,2) or (1,3) on turn 8 to reach it on turn 9.\n\nBut on turn 8, I can only move to adjacent cells: (2,3), (3,2), (3,4).\n\nFrom there, on turn 9, I can move to cells adjacent to those.\n\nFor example, from (2,3) on turn 8, I can move to (2,2) or (1,3) on turn 9, then to (1,2) on turn 9? No: on turn 9, from position at start of turn 9, I move to a new cell.\n\nAt start of turn 8, head at (3,3)\n\nTurn 8: move to, say, (2,3), so after turn 8, head at (2,3)\n\nThen turn 9: from (2,3), I can move to (2,2), (1,3), etc.\n\nIf I move to (2,2) on turn 9, I am at (2,2), and (1,2) is adjacent, but I need to move to (1,2) on turn 9 to eat it, but when I move to (2,2) on turn 9, I am not at (1,2) yet.\n\nTo eat (1,2) on turn 9, I need to move to (1,2) on turn 9.\n\nThat means at the start of turn 9, I must be on a cell adjacent to (1,2), like (2,2), (1,3), or (1,1).\n\nThen on turn 9, I move to (1,2) and eat.\n\nSimilarly for turn 8, but on turn 8 I can't reach adjacent to (1,2) from (3,3).\n\nFrom (3,3), the cells I can reach on turn 8 are (2,3), (3,2), (3,4), none of which is adjacent to (1,2).\n\n(2,3) is at (2,3), which is not adjacent to (1,2); (1,2) is at (1,2), adjacent cells are (1,1), (1,3), (2,2), (0,2) wall.\n\n(2,3) is (2,3), which is not in that list; distance |dx|=1, |dy|=1, not orthogonal adjacent.\n\nSo from (2,3), I can move to (2,2) or (1,3) on turn 9, both of which are adjacent to (1,2), so then on turn 9 I can move to (1,2).\n\nBut (1,2) must be eaten by turn 9, and on turn 9 I can eat it.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (3,2) on turn 8, I am at (3,2), which is not adjacent to (1,2), and from there I can move to (3,1) or (2,2) or (3,3) or (4,2), but to reach (1,2) on turn 9, I need to be adjacent, but (3,2) to (1,2) is not adjacent, and I can't reach in one move from (3,2) to (1,2) directly.\n\nFrom (3,2) on turn 8, on turn 9 I can move to (2,2) for example, then on turn 10 to (1,2), but (1,2) disappears after turn 9, so on turn 10 it's gone, too late.\n\nSo only by being at (2,2) or (1,3) on turn 9 start, I can move to (1,2) on turn 9.\n\nBut to be at (2,2) or (1,3) on turn 9, I need to move there on turn 8 from current position.\n\nOn turn 8, from (3,3), I can move to (2,3), (3,2), or (3,4).\n\n(2,3) is at (2,3), (3,2) at (3,2), (3,4) at (3,4).\n\nFrom (2,3) on turn 8, on turn 9 I can move to (2,2) or (1,3), both adjacent to (1,2).\n\nThen on turn 9, from (2,2) I move left to (1,2), or from (1,3) I move down to (1,2), and eat.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (3,2) on turn 8, I can on turn 9 go to (2,2), then to (1,2) on turn 10, too late.\n\nSo only by going to (2,3) on turn 8, I can set up to eat (1,2) on turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, for (3,5), by going to (3,4) on turn 8, I can eat on turn 9.\n\nNow, I can't do both, since they are in different directions.\n\nSo I have to choose which one to go for.\n\nAlso, there is food at (2,4), which is at (2,4), life span 9, so no rush.\n\nAnd (6,5) at (6,5), life span 6.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nMoreover, the snake is short, length 3, so I can maneuver.\n\nNow, let's consider the grid and obstacles.\n\nWalls at borders, and internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is not near current position.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options for turn 8.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (3,4)\n\nThen on turn 9, move U to (3,5), eat food, snake grows to length 4, head at (3,5), direction U.\n\nThen from there, I need to move somewhere. Possible moves: from (3,5), I can go U to (3,6), D to (3,4) but (3,4) is body, L to (2,5), R to (4,5).\n\n(3,4) is body, so if I go down, I collide with body, die.\n\nSo cannot go D to (3,4).\n\nCan go U to (3,6), L to (2,5), R to (4,5).\n\nNow, (3,6): is it wall? y=6, not y=7, so ok. But there is obstacle at (4,6), but (3,6) is different cell.\n\n(2,5): x=2,y=5, ok.\n\n(4,5): x=4,y=5, ok.\n\nFood available: (2,4) at (2,4), (6,5) at (6,5), and (1,2) might be gone if not eaten.\n\nAfter eating (3,5) on turn 9, (1,2) is not eaten, so it disappears after turn 9.\n\nNow, from (3,5), I can go to (2,5), for example, towards (2,4) or (6,5).\n\n(2,4) is at (2,4), which is below (2,5), so from (2,5) I can go down to (2,4) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) is at (6,5), same y, x=6.\n\nBut from (3,5), to (6,5) is three steps right.\n\nBut I have to avoid walls and body.\n\nAlso, after growing, the body is at (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), so (2,5) is free, etc.\n\nOption 2: Move L to (2,3) on turn 8.\n\nThen on turn 9, I can move to (1,3) or (2,2) or (2,4) or (3,3), but (3,3) might be body? After turn 8, snake at [(2,3), (3,3), (4,3)]? Positions after turn 8 move L: head to (2,3), so snake [(2,3), (3,3), (4,3)]\n\n(4,3) was tail, now it's part of body.\n\nThen turn 9: from (2,3), I can move L to (1,3), D to (2,2), U to (2,4), or R to (3,3).\n\n(3,3) is currently a body segment, so if I move to (3,3), I collide, die.\n\nCannot go R.\n\nCan go L to (1,3), D to (2,2), or U to (2,4).\n\nIf I want to eat (1,2), I can go D to (2,2) or L to (1,3), then from there to (1,2) on turn 9.\n\nFor example, move to (2,2) on turn 9, then to (1,2) but on turn 9 I move to (2,2), not to (1,2) yet.\n\nIf on turn 9 I move directly to (1,2) from (2,3)? (2,3) to (1,2) is not orthogonal, invalid move. Must be U,D,L,R.\n\nSo from (2,3), I can only move to (1,3), (2,2), (2,4), (3,3) invalid.\n\nSo to reach (1,2) on turn 9, I need to move to an adjacent cell first.\n\nBut on turn 9, when I move, if I move to (2,2) or (1,3), I am at that cell, and (1,2) is adjacent, but I eat only when I move to the food cell.\n\nSo on turn 9, after moving to say (2,2), I am at (2,2), and (1,2) is there, but I haven't moved to it yet.\n\nTo eat on turn 9, I need to move to (1,2) on turn 9.\n\nSo from the position at start of turn 9, which is (2,3) if I moved L on turn 8, I must move to (1,2) directly, but (2,3) to (1,2) is not possible; it's diagonal.\n\nThe only way is to move to a cell that is adjacent to (1,2) on turn 9, but from (2,3), I can move to (1,3) or (2,2), both adjacent to (1,2), but when I move to (1,3) or (2,2), I don't eat (1,2), I eat only if I move to a food cell.\n\nSo to eat (1,2) on turn 9, I must start turn 9 on a cell adjacent to (1,2) and move to it.\n\nBut at start of turn 9, if I am at (2,3), I am not adjacent to (1,2), so I cannot move to (1,2) directly.\n\nI can only move to adjacent cells from current position.\n\nSo from (2,3), I can move to (1,3), (2,2), (2,4), (3,3).\n\n(1,3) is adjacent to (1,2), so after moving to (1,3) on turn 9, I am at (1,3), and on turn 10 I can move to (1,2), but (1,2) is gone by then.\n\nSince it disappears after turn 9, on turn 10 it is not there.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to eat (1,2) from the current position because I cannot reach it by turn 9 with the moves available.\n\nLet's confirm the timing.\n\nAt turn 8 start, (1,2) has life span 2, so it is present.\n\nIf I move to (2,3) on turn 8, at the end of turn 8, life span decreases to 1, so it is still present for turn 9.\n\nOn turn 9 start, (1,2) is present with life span 1.\n\nI am at (2,3).\n\nI cannot move directly to (1,2) from (2,3) because it's not orthogonal.\n\nI can move to (1,3) or (2,2), both of which are adjacent to (1,2).\n\nAfter moving to (1,3) on turn 9, I am at (1,3), and (1,2) is still present? When does the food disappear?\n\nThe description: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\".\n\nIt says: \"disappears after N turns\", meaning after N turns from now, it disappears.\n\nAt turn t, with life span S, it will disappear after S turns, so at the beginning of turn t+S, it is gone.\n\nStandard: usually, at the start of turn, food with life span >0 is present.\n\nAfter the turn, life span decreases.\n\nSo at turn 8 start, food with life span 2 is present.\n\nAfter turn 8, life span decreases to 1.\n\nAt turn 9 start, food with life span 1 is present.\n\nAfter turn 9, life span decreases to 0, so at turn 10 start, it is gone.\n\nSo on turn 9, (1,2) is present, and I can eat it if I move to it on turn 9.\n\nTo move to it on turn 9, I must be on an adjacent cell at turn 9 start.\n\nAt turn 9 start, if I am at (2,3), I am not adjacent to (1,2), so I cannot move to (1,2) on turn 9.\n\nIf I am at (1,3) or (2,2) at turn 9 start, I can move to (1,2) on turn 9.\n\nBut at turn 9 start, where am I? That depends on turn 8 move.\n\nIf on turn 8 I move to (1,3), but from (3,3), I can't reach (1,3) in one move; only to (2,3), (3,2), (3,4).\n\nSo at turn 9 start, after turn 8 move, I can be at (2,3), (3,2), or (3,4), none of which is (1,3) or (2,2).\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to eat (1,2) because I cannot be in position to move to it on turn 8 or 9.\n\nTurn 8: from (3,3), I can move to (2,3), (3,2), or (3,4). None is adjacent to (1,2), and from there I can't reach (1,2) in one move on turn 9.\n\nSo (1,2) cannot be eaten; it will disappear without being eaten.\n\nSimilarly, for (3,5): at (3,5), from (3,3), I can move to (3,4) on turn 8, then at turn 9 start I am at (3,4), which is adjacent to (3,5) above.\n\nSo on turn 9, I can move U to (3,5) and eat it.\n\nSo only (3,5) can be eaten, not (1,2).\n\n(1,2) is too far and cannot be reached in time.\n\nSo for turn 8, moving U to (3,4) is good to get the food at (3,5) on turn 9.\n\nMoving L to (2,3) doesn't help for food, and moving D to (3,2) also not.\n\nSo I should move U on turn 8.\n\nThen on turn 9, move U to (3,5) and eat.\n\nNow, after that, as I said, head at (3,5), direction U, snake length 4: positions [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3)]\n\nNow, from (3,5), I can move U to (3,6), L to (2,5), or R to (4,5). Cannot move D to (3,4) because it's body.\n\nNow, let's see the grid.\n\n(3,6): y=6, not wall. Is there obstacle? Internal obstacle at (4,6), but (3,6) is different.\n\n(2,5): x=2,y=5, ok.\n\n(4,5): x=4,y=5, ok.\n\nFood available: (2,4) at (2,4), value 1, life span 9 at turn 8, but now turn 9? Let's track time.\n\nCurrent turn is t1=8.\n\nTurn 8: I move U to (3,4)\n\nAfter turn 8, food life spans decrease: (1,2) was 2, now 1; (3,5) was 2, now 1; (6,5) was 6, now 5; (2,4) was 9, now 8.\n\nAt turn 9 start, food: (1,2) life span 1, present; (3,5) life span 1, present; (6,5) life span 5; (2,4) life span 8.\n\nOn turn 9, I move U to (3,5) and eat (3,5), so it is consumed.\n\n(1,2) is still present with life span 1.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows to length 4: positions [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3)]\n\nHead at (3,5), direction U.\n\nNow turn 10: from (3,5), I can move U, L, or R.\n\nIf I move U to (3,6), then head at (3,6), no food there, so tail moves, snake becomes [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)]? Body: after head to (3,6), previous head (3,5) becomes body, then (3,4), (3,3), and tail (4,3) is left, so positions [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)]\n\n(4,3) is gone.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut there is food at (2,4) and (6,5), and (1,2) is still present but life span 1, so on turn 10 it can be eaten, but I am at (3,5) or (3,6), far from (1,2).\n\n(1,2) at (1,2), from (3,5) it's multiple moves away, and after turn 10, it disappears, so I can't eat it. Similarly, only present on turn 10 if I can reach, but I can't in one move from (3,5) to (1,2), impossible.\n\nSo (1,2) will not be eaten.\n\nNow, (2,4) at (2,4), which is below and left.\n\nFrom current position at turn 9 after eating, head at (3,5).\n\nOn turn 10, if I move L to (2,5), then I am at (2,5), which is above (2,4).\n\nThen on turn 11, I can move D to (2,4) and eat.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) at (6,5), same y, to the right.\n\nBut to go right, I need to be able to move R.\n\nCurrently at (3,5), after turn 9.\n\nLet's plan turn by turn.\n\nFirst, turn 8: move U to (3,4)  // to set up for (3,5)\n\nTurn 9: move U to (3,5)  // eat food, grow to length 4\n\nNow turn 10: from (3,5), I need to choose move.\n\nOptions: U to (3,6), L to (2,5), R to (4,5)\n\nNow, (2,4) food is at (2,4), which is down from (2,5), so if I go L to (2,5), I can then go down to (2,4).\n\n(6,5) is at (6,5), to the right.\n\nBut going right might take time.\n\nAlso, there is the obstacle at (4,6), but not immediate.\n\nNow, if I go to (2,5) on turn 10, then on turn 11 to (2,4), eat.\n\n(2,4) has life span 8 at turn 8, so at turn 10, what is life span?\n\nTurn 8: life span 9\n\nAfter turn 8: 8\n\nTurn 9: 8 (since I moved, but food not eaten, life span decreases after each turn)\n\nAt turn 9 start, after turn 8, life span of (2,4) is 8 (was 9 at turn 8, decreased after turn 8 to 8).\n\nAfter turn 9, decreases to 7, so at turn 10 start, life span 7, plenty.\n\nSimilarly, on turn 11, I can eat.\n\nIf I go to (4,5) on turn 10, then to (5,5), (6,5) to eat on turn 12 or something.\n\nBut (6,5) life span: at turn 8:6, turn9:5, turn10:4, turn11:3, turn12:2, etc., so time.\n\nBut going for (2,4) is closer.\n\nAlso, after eating (2,4), I might have more space.\n\nBut let's see the body positions.\n\nAfter turn 9: snake at [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3)]\n\nIf on turn 10 I move L to (2,5), no food, so tail moves, snake becomes [(2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)]? Head to (2,5), then body: (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), and tail (4,3) gone, so [(2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)]\n\n(3,3) is the last body segment.\n\nThen turn 11: move D to (2,4). (2,4) has food, so eat, grow to length 5. New head at (2,4), body: (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), so positions [(2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)]\n\nHead at (2,4), direction D (since moved down).\n\nNow, from here, I can move to adjacent cells.\n\nPossible moves: from (2,4), I can go U to (2,5), but (2,5) is body, collision.\n\nD to (2,3), L to (1,4), R to (3,4) but (3,4) is body, collision.\n\n(3,4) is body, yes.\n\nSo only possible moves: D to (2,3) or L to (1,4).\n\nCannot go U or R because body.\n\n(2,5) is body, (3,4) is body.\n\nSo only down to (2,3) or left to (1,4).\n\nNow, (2,3) and (1,4) should be free.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut this might be a bit trapped, but I can go to (2,3) or (1,4).\n\nNow, back to turn 10 choice.\n\nIf on turn 10 from (3,5) I move R to (4,5), then no food, snake moves: head to (4,5), body: (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), tail (4,3) gone? Positions: after move, [(4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)]\n\nThen I can go towards (6,5).\n\nFor example, turn 11: from (4,5) move R to (5,5), no food.\n\nSnake [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nThen turn 12: move R to (6,5), eat food, grow to length 5.\n\nBut (6,5) has life span, at turn 12 it should be present if life span allows.\n\nAt turn 8: life span 6\n\nTurn 9: 5\n\nTurn 10: 4\n\nTurn 11: 3\n\nTurn 12: 2, present, so yes.\n\nBut this takes more turns, and I might miss other opportunities.\n\nIf I move U to (3,6) on turn 10 from (3,5).\n\n(3,6) is empty, no food, so snake moves to [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)]\n\nThen from (3,6), I can move U to (3,7), but y=7 is wall? Walls at y=7, so (3,7) is wall, cannot move there.\n\nCan move L to (2,6), R to (4,6), but (4,6) is internal obstacle, so wall, cannot move there.\n\nOr D to (3,5), but (3,5) is body, collision.\n\nSo from (3,6), possible moves: L to (2,6) or R to (4,6) but (4,6) obstacle, so only L to (2,6).\n\nThen to (2,6), and so on.\n\nBut no food nearby, so not ideal.\n\nTherefore, moving U on turn 10 might lead to dead end.\n\nBetter to go left or right towards food.\n\nNow, between (2,4) and (6,5), (2,4) is closer from current position after turn 9.\n\nFrom (3,5), (2,4) is at distance |dx|=1, |dy|=1, but not adjacent, so I need two moves: e.g., to (2,5) then to (2,4).\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) is at (6,5), from (3,5) to (4,5) to (5,5) to (6,5), three moves.\n\nSo (2,4) is closer.\n\nAlso, after eating (2,4), I might have a path out.\n\nEarlier I saw that after eating at (2,4), I can only go down or left, but I can go to (2,3) or (1,4), then from there explore.\n\nFor example, from (2,4) after eating, go down to (2,3), then to (2,2), etc., or left to (1,4), then to (1,5), etc.\n\nThere might be more food later, but currently only these.\n\nAlso, (6,5) is still there.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should eat as much as possible.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, let's outline a plan.\n\nTurn 8: U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 9: U to (3,5) eat\n\nNow turn 10: I need to move. Best to go towards (2,4), so move L to (2,5)\n\nThen turn 11: from (2,5), move D to (2,4) eat, grow to length 5.\n\nAfter eating, positions: [(2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)]\n\nHead at (2,4), direction D.\n\nNow turn 12: from (2,4), possible moves: D to (2,3) or L to (1,4). Cannot go U or R.\n\n(2,3) should be free, (1,4) free.\n\nSay, move D to (2,3)\n\nThen no food, snake moves: head to (2,3), body: (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), tail (3,3) gone, so [(2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nHead at (2,3), direction D.\n\nThen turn 13: from (2,3), possible moves: D to (2,2), L to (1,3), U to (2,4) but (2,4) is body, collision, R to (3,3) but (3,3) not occupied, but in positions, (3,4) is body, (3,3) is not in snake now, since tail moved.\n\nPositions: [(2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nSo cells occupied: (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4)\n\n(3,3) is empty.\n\nFrom (2,3), can move D to (2,2), L to (1,3), R to (3,3), U to (2,4) but (2,4) is body, so invalid.\n\nSo D, L, or R.\n\n(2,2) might be free, (1,3), (3,3).\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nSimilarly, I could have gone left earlier.\n\nBut back to turn 10, if I go to (2,5), then down to (2,4), it seems fine.\n\nWhat about the other food (6,5)? I can go for it later if possible.\n\nBut with the snake growing, it might be harder.\n\nSince I need to survive, and there are no immediate threats, eating (2,4) soon is good.\n\nNow, another thing: the tail reward danger, but not applicable here.\n\nAlso, food under body: but no food under snake now.\n\nSo for turn 8, moving U is best to get the expiring food.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, go for (2,4).\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but how many? The problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but answer format is to list actions starting from turn t1.\n\nIt says: \"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action ... Turn t1+1: action ... }\"\n\nBut it doesn't specify how many turns to list. Probably list a sequence of actions for a few turns.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should list at least 5 actions or so.\n\nBut the state might change, so I can plan a sequence.\n\nPerhaps list actions until I eat food or something.\n\nBut I think for this, since I have a plan, I can list from turn 8 to turn 12 or so.\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U (eat at (3,5))\n\nThen turn 10: L to (2,5)\n\nTurn 11: D to (2,4) eat\n\nThen turn 12: say D to (2,3) or something, but I need to specify.\n\nSince after turn 11, I eat, and then I have choices.\n\nBut for the answer, I can list up to where I have a clear plan.\n\nPerhaps list until the next decision point.\n\nBut let's see the food (6,5), I might want to go for it after.\n\nBut from (2,4), it's far.\n\nAfter eating (2,4) at turn 11, head at (2,4), I can go to (3,3) or other.\n\nIn the sequence above, on turn 12, from (2,4) I move to (2,3) or (1,4).\n\nSay, move to (2,3) on turn 12.\n\nThen on turn 13, from (2,3) I can move to (3,3), etc., towards (6,5).\n\nBut it might take time.\n\nAnother option: on turn 10, instead of going left, I could go right towards (6,5), but it's farther, and (2,4) might be eaten later, but no rush, but since it's closer, better to eat sooner.\n\nMoreover, with the internal obstacle at (4,6), if I go to (6,5), I need to be careful.\n\nFor example, (4,6) is obstacle, so from (4,5) I cannot go up to (4,6), etc.\n\nBut not immediate.\n\nI think going for (2,4) is better for short term score.\n\nTo think long-term survival, after eating (2,4), the snake is longer, and I need to find a path to not trap myself.\n\nFor example, from [(2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)], I can move down to (2,3), then to (3,3) but (3,3) is not occupied now, or to (2,2), then I have space to move.\n\n(3,3) is empty, so from (2,3) I can go to (3,3), then to (4,3), etc., towards (6,5).\n\n(6,5) is at (6,5), so I can go through the bottom or middle.\n\nBut let's not plan too far.\n\nFor now, for turn 8, I think U is the best move.\n\nThen for turn 9, U.\n\nThen for turn 10, L to (2,5)\n\nTurn 11: D to (2,4) eat\n\nThen for turn 12, I need to move, say D to (2,3) or L to (1,4).\n\nTo have a sequence, I can choose one.\n\nSay, move D to (2,3) on turn 12.\n\nBut I need to output the actions.\n\nPerhaps in the answer, list actions for turns 8,9,10,11,12.\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: L\n\nTurn 11: D\n\nThen turn 12: say D or something.\n\nBut on turn 12, after turn 11, positions depend.\n\nAfter turn 11: at turn 11, I move D to (2,4) and eat, so at end of turn 11, snake [(2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)]\n\nTurn 12: from (2,4), move D to (2,3), no food, so snake moves to [(2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nThen turn 13: from (2,3), move R to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut for the answer, I think listing up to turn 11 or 12 is fine.\n\nSince the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", listing 5 actions might be good.\n\nFrom turn 8 to turn 12: 5 turns.\n\nActions: turn 8,9,10,11,12.\n\nBut on turn 12, I need to specify.\n\nTo be safe, I can list until turn 11, since turn 11 I eat another food.\n\nNow, what about moving down on turn 8? That might not be good, as I miss the expiring food.\n\nSimilarly, left might not lead to food soon.\n\nSo U is best.\n\nTherefore, for turn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: L\n\nTurn 11: D\n\nThen for turn 12, I can add, but it might be optional.\n\nIn the answer format, it says \"Turn t1: action ...\" so I need to list multiple.\n\nPerhaps list 4 actions: turn 8 to 11.\n\nBut let's see the initial direction.\n\nAnother thing: after turn 9, when I eat at (3,5), the head direction is U, and when I move L to (2,5) on turn 10, direction changes to L.\n\nNo problem, as long as not instant reverse, but reverse was only forbidden from current direction, but after move, direction changes.\n\nThe rule is \"no instant reverse\" on next turn, meaning from current direction.\n\nFor example, after moving U, direction is U, so next turn cannot move D.\n\nBut here, on turn 9 I move U to (3,5), direction U.\n\nThen turn 10, I move L, which is not opposite, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, on turn 11, from (2,5), if I move D, opposite to previous? Previous direction was L? On turn 10 I moved L to (2,5), so direction is L.\n\nThen move D to (2,4), is that opposite? L is left, D is down, not opposite; opposite would be R.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nThen after, direction D.\n\nSo all good.\n\nNow, for the output.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score while ensuring long-term survival, the plan prioritizes eating the expiring positive food at (3,5) on turn 9, as it has only 2 turns of life span remaining at turn 8 and cannot be reached later. After that, the snake moves toward the food at (2,4), which has a longer life span (9 at turn 8), to eat it on turn 11. The sequence avoids collisions and considers the no-instant-reverse rule, with moves planned 5 turns ahead (turns 8 to 12) for stability.\n\n- **Turn 8: Move U (up) to (3,4)**  \n  This sets up the snake to reach (3,5) on turn 9. Moving left or down would miss the expiring food at (3,5) and provide no immediate benefit.\n\n- **Turn 9: Move U (up) to (3,5)**  \n  Eat the positive food here (value +1, snake grows to length 4). The food at (1,2) expires after this turn and is ignored, as it is unreachable in time.\n\n- **Turn 10: Move L (left) to (2,5)**  \n  From (3,5), moving left positions the snake to reach (2,4) next. Moving up or right is less efficient; up leads to a dead end near the wall, and right delays eating (2,4).\n\n- **Turn 11: Move D (down) to (2,4)**  \n  Eat the positive food here (value +1, snake grows to length 5). This is the optimal short-term score gain, as (2,4) is closer than (6,5).\n\n- **Turn 12: Move D (down) to (2,3)**  \n  After eating, the snake must move down to avoid body collision (up and right are blocked by body segments). This opens paths to explore the grid safely, such as moving right toward (6,5) in future turns.\n\n### Reasoning Details:\n- **Food Prioritization**: (3,5) is expiring (life span 2 at turn 8, must be eaten by turn 9) and is reachable; (1,2) is unreachable by turn 9 and expires. (2,4) is targeted next for its proximity and high life span (eaten on turn 11). (6,5) can be eaten later (life span 6 at turn 8, valid until turn 13).\n- **Collision Avoidance**: All moves avoid walls, obstacles (e.g., (4,6)), and body segments. After eating at (2,4), moving down on turn 12 prevents collision with the body at (2,4) or (3,4).\n- **Long-Term Survival**: After turn 12, the snake can head toward (6,5) or other areas, with a length of 5 and ample space. The sequence ensures the snake does not trap itself (e.g., avoiding the top row near walls).\n- **No-Instant-Reverse**: Direction changes respect the rule (e.g., from L to D on turn 11 is allowed, as down is not opposite to left).\n\nThis plan scores +2 by eating two foods within 5 turns and maintains a safe path for future moves.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: L\nTurn 11: D\nTurn 12: D\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), but since walls are at those borders, the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm.\n\nThe walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So moving to any cell where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall collision. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (4,6). So I need to avoid that too.\n\nSnake positions: head at (3,4), then (3,3), (4,3). So the snake has three segments: head at (3,4), body at (3,3), tail at (4,3). Head direction is U, which is up, so moving towards increasing y.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (1,2) with value 1, life_span 1\n\n- (3,5) with value 1, life_span 1\n\n- (6,5) with value 5, life_span 1? Wait, the format is (x,y,value,life_span), but in the input it's given as (x,y,value,life_span), but for (6,5) it says 5,1 – I think that's value=5, life_span=1. Similarly, (2,4) has 8,1 so value=8, life_span=1.\n\nLet's read carefully:\n\nFood Positions, Life Span and Value:\n\n- (1, 2, 1, 1)  // so x=1,y=2, value=1, life_span=1\n\n- (3, 5, 1, 1)  // x=3,y=5, value=1, life_span=1\n\n- (6, 5, 5, 1)  // x=6,y=5, value=5, life_span=1\n\n- (2, 4, 8, 1)  // x=2,y=4, value=8, life_span=1\n\nAll food has life_span=1, meaning they disappear after this turn or next? Life-span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So for turn t1=9, if life_span=1, it will disappear after turn 9, meaning it's only available on turn 9? Countdown decreases including current turn.\n\nLet's clarify the life-span.\n\nIt says: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for a food with life_span L, when it spawns, countdown starts at L. Each turn, including the turn it spawns, countdown decreases by 1. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears after that turn? Or at the end of the turn?\n\nThe rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", so after N turns from spawn, it's gone.\n\nBut in terms of when it can be eaten: on turn t, if food has life_span k, it means it will disappear after k more turns, so it can be eaten on turns where the countdown is >0.\n\nSince countdown decreases every turn including current, for a food with life_span L on turn t, it can be eaten on turn t, and if not eaten, it will be there on turn t+1 only if L>1, etc., until countdown reaches 0, after which it disappears.\n\nIn this case, all foods have life_span=1 on turn t1=9. So for each food, life_span=1 means:\n\n- On turn 9, countdown=1, so it can be eaten on turn 9.\n\n- After turn 9, countdown decreases to 0, so it disappears and cannot be eaten on turn 10.\n\nSince life_span=1, and we're on turn 9, all food will disappear after this turn. So if not eaten on turn 9, they are gone forever.\n\nIs that right? Let's see.\n\nTurn t1=9, food has life_span=1. Countdown starts at 1 on this turn? Or is life_span the remaining life?\n\nThe input says \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span\" for the current state, so life_span given is the current remaining life_span, I think.\n\nSimilarly, in the core rules, it says \"disappears after N turns\", and N=life_span.\n\nBut in the context, when food is listed, the life_span is the current value.\n\nFor example, for (1,2,1,1) at turn 9, it means remaining life_span=1, so it will disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\nSimilarly for all others.\n\nSo all food will vanish after turn 9 if not eaten now.\n\nNow, I need to choose actions for multiple turns ahead, starting from turn 9.\n\nThe answer should be for turns: t1=9, t1+1=10, t1+2=11, etc., but since I have to think 5+ turns ahead, I need to plan a sequence.\n\nBut the food is only available now, so on turn 9, I have a chance to eat one of them, or none.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid risks and prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid.\n\nGrid size: walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, since moving to x=0 or 7 or y=0 or 7 is wall collision.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), so (4,6) is blocked.\n\nSnake: positions [(3,4), (3,3), (4,3)] so:\n\n- Head: (3,4)\n\n- Body: (3,3)\n\n- Tail: (4,3)\n\nHead direction is U (up), so last move was up to (3,4).\n\nCurrent possible moves: I can move U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n\nNo instant reverse: since head direction is U, I cannot move D (down) immediately, because that would be opposite.\n\nSo possible moves from (3,4): U, L, R. Not D.\n\nNow, what are the adjacent cells:\n\n- U (up): (3,5)\n\n- D (down): (3,3) but (3,3) is occupied by body, so moving there would cause collision, since head touches body segment. Also, D is reverse, not allowed anyway.\n\n- L (left): (2,4)\n\n- R (right): (4,4)\n\nNow, check for collisions:\n\n- U: (3,5) – is this free? Food is at (3,5), but let's see if it's safe.\n\n(3,5) has food, but we need to see if moving there causes issues.\n\nFirst, is (3,5) occupied? Snake positions: (3,4), (3,3), (4,3) – so (3,5) is not occupied by snake. Also, not a wall, since y=5 is within 1-6, x=3 within 1-6. Obstacle at (4,6), not (3,5). So (3,5) is free.\n\nSimilarly, L: (2,4) – is it free? (2,4) has food, but snake not there, not wall. Walls: x=0,7 y=0,7, so (2,4) is playable. Obstacle (4,6) not here.\n\nR: (4,4) – no food mentioned, so probably empty. Not occupied by snake, not wall, not obstacle.\n\nNow, food at (3,5) is positive, value=1, life_span=1, so if I move U to (3,5), I eat it, snake grows to length 4.\n\nBut there's a risk: Tail Reward Danger.\n\nTail Reward Danger: If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nWhat is the tail? Currently tail is at (4,3).\n\nAfter moving, if I eat food, the snake grows, so tail doesn't move, but a new segment is added.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat, you grow, so the tail stays, and head moves to food, new segment added at head position? No.\n\nIn snake, when you move, head moves to new cell, and tail moves forward one cell, unless you eat, then tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n\nSpecifically: when you move without eating, head to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position, tail is removed.\n\nWhen you eat, head moves to food, new segment is added at the position where head was, so the tail doesn't move; it stays, and a new segment is added before tail or something.\n\nLet's clarify the movement.\n\nTypically in snake: positions are a list. When moving without eating, head goes to new position, each subsequent segment moves to the previous position of the one before, so the last segment (tail) is removed.\n\nWhen eating, head goes to food, new segment is added at the position where the head was, so the tail doesn't move; it stays, and a new segment is inserted.\n\nFor example, current snake: [(3,4), (3,3), (4,3)] so head (3,4), body (3,3), tail (4,3).\n\nIf I move to (3,5) and eat, new positions: head at (3,5), then the previous head (3,4) becomes new body, so [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3)] – so tail is still (4,3) for now, but since we ate, we add a segment, so the tail doesn't advance yet; after eating, the snake length increases, so the tail remains in place until the next move.\n\nAfter eating, the tail doesn't move on that turn; it stays, so the new segment is added, and on subsequent moves, when not eating, tail moves.\n\nBut for collision: after moving to (3,5) and eating, the positions are [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3)].\n\nNow, the head is at (3,5), and the body segments are (3,4), (3,3), (4,3).\n\nIs there collision? Head at (3,5) not touching any body except (3,4) which is adjacent, but that's normal, since it's the neck.\n\nCollision is if head touches any body segment except the immediate one behind.\n\nTypically, head can touch the first body segment, but not others.\n\nIn this case, after move, head at (3,5), body at (3,4) (which was head), then (3,3), then (4,3). So head (3,5) adjacent to (3,4), which is fine, and not adjacent to (3,3) or (4,3), since (3,5) to (3,3) is two steps away, similarly to (4,3).\n\nPositions: (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3) – all distinct, no overlap.\n\n(3,5) and (3,4) adjacent vertically, (3,4) and (3,3) adjacent vertically, (3,3) and (4,3) adjacent horizontally.\n\nHead only adjacent to (3,4), which is the segment behind, so no collision.\n\nBut Tail Reward Danger is a specific case.\n\nTail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to the tail, and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n\nIn this case, before moving, is head adjacent to tail?\n\nCurrent head (3,4), tail (4,3). Are they adjacent? (3,4) and (4,3) are diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n\nSo (3,4) and (4,3) are not adjacent; they are diagonally touching, but in grid terms, adjacent usually means orthogonal, not diagonal.\n\nThe movement is U,D,L,R, so only orthogonal.\n\nSo (3,4) and (4,3) are not adjacent; distance is sqrt(2), not 1.\n\nSo head is not adjacent to tail.\n\nTherefore, moving to (3,5) should be safe.\n\nBut (3,5) has food with value 1.\n\nNow, other options.\n\nI could move L to (2,4), which has food at (2,4) with value 8, life_span=1.\n\n(2,4) is free? Snake positions: (3,4), (3,3), (4,3) – no (2,4), not wall, so yes.\n\nMove R to (4,4), which seems empty, no food mentioned.\n\nAlso, food at (1,2) and (6,5), but I can't reach them this turn from (3,4) since only adjacent moves.\n\nSo possible actions on turn 9: U, L, R.\n\nIf U: to (3,5), eat food value 1, grow to length 4.\n\nIf L: to (2,4), eat food value 8, grow to length 4.\n\nIf R: to (4,4), no eat, snake moves, tail moves, so new positions: head to (4,4), then body to (3,4), tail to (3,3), so [(4,4), (3,4), (3,3)] – tail was (4,3), which moves to where body was, but since not eating, tail moves: head new position (4,4), then the segment that was body (3,3) moves to where head was (3,4)? Let's sequence.\n\nCurrent: positions list: index 0: head (3,4), index 1: body (3,3), index 2: tail (4,3).\n\nMove R to (4,4), not eating.\n\nNew head at (4,4).\n\nThen, the body segments follow: segment 1 (was at (3,3)) moves to previous position of head, which is (3,4).\n\nSegment 2 (was at (4,3)) moves to previous position of segment 1, which was (3,3).\n\nBut segment 1 moves to (3,4), segment 2 moves to (3,3).\n\nSo new positions: [(4,4), (3,4), (3,3)]\n\nTail is now (3,3).\n\nLength same.\n\nSimilarly, if I move U to (3,5) and eat, new positions: [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3)] since we add a segment; the tail (4,3) stays.\n\nIf move L to (2,4) and eat, new positions: [(2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3)]\n\nNow, back to turn 9 choices.\n\nBut I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n\nAll food disappears after this turn, so on turn 10, no food, I assume, unless new food spawns, but the state doesn't say anything about new food spawning, so I think for now, after turn 9, no food, so I need to survive and be ready for future food.\n\nBut I should maximize score, so eating high-value food is good, but with risks.\n\nNow, eating (2,4) gives value 8, which is high, while (3,5) gives only 1, and (6,5) gives 5 but I can't reach it this turn.\n\n(6,5) is at (6,5), I'm at (3,4), not adjacent.\n\nSo only possible to eat (3,5) or (2,4) or nothing.\n\nNow, eating (2,4) is tempting because of high value 8.\n\nBut let's see the position.\n\nAfter eating, snake will be longer, which might be riskier in small grid.\n\nGrid is 6x6 playable, since x1-6, y1-6, but with obstacle.\n\nPlayable cells: total 36 cells minus 1 obstacle, 35 cells.\n\nSnake length 3 now, after eating, length 4.\n\nNot too bad.\n\nBut let's think about the future moves.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid getting trapped.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving to (2,4) to eat the value 8 food.\n\nAction on turn 9: L to (2,4)\n\nThen snake positions: [(2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3)] head at (2,4), direction was L, but head direction changes to the move direction, I think.\n\nAfter move, head direction is the direction I moved.\n\nFor turn 10, head at (2,4), and I need to choose next move.\n\nPossible moves from (2,4): U, D, L, R, but with no reverse since last move was L, so cannot move R (right).\n\nLast move: on turn 9 I moved L to (2,4), so head direction is L.\n\nSo on turn 10, cannot move R (opposite).\n\nPossible: U (up) to (2,5)\n\nD (down) to (2,3)\n\nL (left) to (1,4)\n\nNow, check cells:\n\n(2,5): is it free? Not occupied by snake: current positions (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3) – no (2,5). Walls: y=5 is within 1-6, x=2 within 1-6, not wall. Obstacle at (4,6), not here. So free.\n\n(2,3): not occupied, not wall. y=3, x=2.\n\n(1,4): x=1, y=4, not wall? Walls at x=0 and x=7, so x=1 is playable, since x=0 is wall, x=1 to 6 are ok. Similarly y=1 to 6.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, so cells with x=1 to x=6 are playable, except borders.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, so moving to x=0 or x=7 is death, but x=1 to 6 are fine.\n\nSimilarly for y.\n\nSo (1,4) is playable, not occupied.\n\nNow, no food, so wherever I move, no eat.\n\nSay I move U to (2,5) on turn 10.\n\nThen new positions: head to (2,5), then body moves: segment that was (3,4) moves to (2,4), segment that was (3,3) moves to (3,4), segment that was (4,3) moves to (3,3), and since not eating, the tail (4,3) moves to (3,3), but (3,3) was occupied by the body? Positions: after move, head at (2,5), then the first body segment moves to previous head position (2,4), but (2,4) is now the new position for the first body.\n\nCurrent before move: [(2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3)]\n\nMove U to (2,5), not eating.\n\nNew head: (2,5)\n\nThen, the segment that was at index 1, (3,4), moves to where head was, (2,4)\n\nSegment that was at index 2, (3,3), moves to where index 1 was, (3,4)\n\nSegment that was at index 3, (4,3), moves to where index 2 was, (3,3)\n\nSo new positions: [(2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)]\n\nTail is (3,3)\n\nSimilarly, if I move D to (2,3), head to (2,3), then body: (3,4) moves to (2,4), (3,3) moves to (3,4), (4,3) moves to (3,3), so [(2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)]\n\nOr move L to (1,4), head to (1,4), body: (3,4) to (2,4)? (3,4) moves to (2,4), but (2,4) is current position, but in the list, it moves to the previous position.\n\nAfter head moves to (1,4), the first body segment (was at (3,4)) moves to previous head position (2,4), so to (2,4)\n\nThen second body segment (was at (3,3)) moves to previous position of first body, which was (3,4)\n\nThird body segment (was at (4,3)) moves to previous position of second body, (3,3)\n\nSo positions: [(1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)]\n\nTail (3,3)\n\nNow, from (2,4), moving to (2,5) or (2,3) or (1,4) all seem possible, but I need to think which is better for future.\n\nBut there might be risks.\n\nAnother option: if on turn 9 I move U to (3,5) to eat the value 1 food.\n\nThen positions: [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3)]\n\nHead at (3,5), direction U.\n\nTurn 10, possible moves: from (3,5), cannot move D (down) because reverse of U.\n\nSo can move U, L, R.\n\nU: to (3,6)\n\nL: to (2,5)\n\nR: to (4,5)\n\nNow, check cells:\n\n(3,6): y=6, but walls at y=7 and y=0, so y=6 is playable? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6 are playable, y=6 is ok.\n\nBut there is internal obstacle at (4,6), but (3,6) is different.\n\n(3,6) not occupied, not wall.\n\nBut (4,6) is obstacle, so (3,6) should be fine.\n\n(2,5): not occupied, not wall.\n\n(4,5): not occupied, not wall, but obstacle at (4,6), not (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is free.\n\nNo food, so no eat.\n\nSay move U to (3,6): head to (3,6), then body: (3,4) moves to (3,5)? Positions before move: [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3)]\n\nHead to (3,6), not eat.\n\nThen body: segment at (3,4) moves to (3,5)\n\nSegment at (3,3) moves to (3,4)\n\nSegment at (4,3) moves to (3,3)\n\nSo new positions: [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)]\n\nTail (3,3)\n\nNow, (3,6) is at top row, y=6.\n\nBut walls at y=7, so y=6 is not wall, but adjacent to wall? No, moving to y=6 is fine, but if I go to y=7, it's wall, death.\n\nSimilarly, x=6 is fine.\n\nBut from (3,6), I can move U, but U would be to (3,7), which is y=7, wall, so death. So I cannot move U from (3,6).\n\nSimilarly, from (3,6), possible moves: D (down to (3,5)), L (left to (2,6)), R (right to (4,6))\n\nBut (4,6) is obstacle, so cannot move there.\n\n(3,5) is occupied by body, if I move D to (3,5), it's the body segment, collision.\n\nAfter positions [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)], head at (3,6), body at (3,5), which is directly below, so moving D to (3,5) would hit the body.\n\nL to (2,6): let's see if free.\n\n(2,6) not occupied, not wall (x=2,y=6), obstacle at (4,6), not here.\n\nR to (4,6): but (4,6) is obstacle, so wall collision.\n\nSo from (3,6), only possible move is L to (2,6), since D is body, R is obstacle, U is wall.\n\nU to (3,7) wall, R to (4,6) obstacle, D to (3,5) body, so only L to (2,6) is possible.\n\nThen on turn 11, from (2,6), etc.\n\nBut this seems risky if I go to (3,6).\n\nIf from (3,5) on turn 10, I move L to (2,5) or R to (4,5).\n\n(2,5) or (4,5) both seem safer.\n\nBut back to turn 9 decision.\n\nIf I eat the value 8 at (2,4), I get high score, but let's see the position.\n\nAfter eating at (2,4), positions [(2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3)]\n\nHead at (2,4), direction L.\n\nTurn 10, I need to move.\n\nAs before, U to (2,5), D to (2,3), L to (1,4).\n\n(2,5) is free, (2,3) is free, (1,4) is free.\n\nIf I move U to (2,5), positions become [(2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)] as before.\n\nThen from (2,5), head direction U.\n\nTurn 11, possible moves: U to (2,6), D to (2,4) but (2,4) is body, collision, L to (1,5), R to (3,5).\n\nCannot move D because reverse and body.\n\nU to (2,6): free? (2,6) not occupied, not wall.\n\nL to (1,5): free, x=1,y=5 ok.\n\nR to (3,5): free? Not occupied, should be free.\n\nSay move to (2,6): then positions head (2,6), body to (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) — from [(2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)] move U to (2,6), not eat, so head (2,6), then (2,4) moves to (2,5), (3,4) moves to (2,4), (3,3) moves to (3,4), so [(2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)]\n\nThen from (2,6), similar to before, I can only move L to (1,6) or D to (2,5) but (2,5) is body, or U to (2,7) wall, R to (3,6) which is free? (3,6) not occupied.\n\n(3,6) is free, since no snake there.\n\nPositions have (3,4) at tail, not (3,6).\n\nSo from (2,6), I can move R to (3,6) or L to (1,6), not D to (2,5) body, not U to (2,7) wall.\n\nSo (3,6) or (1,6).\n\nBoth possible.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nPerhaps I should consider not eating any food to keep snake short for now, but since food is available and high value, eating the 8 might be good.\n\nBut there's a food at (6,5) value 5, but I can't reach it now, and it disappears, so lost.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) value 1, also lost.\n\nSo only options are eat (3,5) value 1 or (2,4) value 8 or nothing.\n\nEating nothing: move R to (4,4) on turn 9.\n\nThen positions: [(4,4), (3,4), (3,3)] since not eat, tail moves.\n\nHead at (4,4), direction R (since moved right).\n\nTurn 10, possible moves: from (4,4), cannot move L (left) because reverse of R.\n\nCan move U, D, R.\n\nU to (4,5), D to (4,3), R to (5,4)\n\nNow, (4,5) is free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\n(4,3) is where? Current positions: head (4,4), body (3,4), tail (3,3) — after move, positions [(4,4), (3,4), (3,3)]\n\n(4,3) is not occupied, but (3,3) is tail, but (4,3) is different cell.\n\n(4,3) is free, no food.\n\nD to (4,3): free.\n\nR to (5,4): free, x=5,y=4.\n\nU to (4,5): free.\n\nAll good, no food.\n\nBut I missed the high-value food.\n\nValue 8 is high, so probably worth eating.\n\nBut let's check if there is Tail Reward Danger for (2,4).\n\nTail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n\nCurrent head (3,4), tail (4,3), not adjacent, as diagonal.\n\nSo no danger.\n\nSimilarly for (3,5).\n\nSo both are safe to eat.\n\nBut eating (2,4) gives more points.\n\nNow, after eating (2,4), I am at (2,4), which is left side of grid.\n\nFrom there, I can explore.\n\nBut let's see the food at (2,4) is at (2,4), which is also the position I move to, so I eat it.\n\nAnother thing: food can spawn under body, but here (2,4) is not under body, it's free.\n\nSimilarly (3,5) is free.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should eat the value 8.\n\nBut let's think 5 turns ahead.\n\nTurn 9: action\n\nThen turn 10,11,12,13,14.\n\nBut since no food, I need to survive and not get trapped.\n\nGrid has obstacle at (4,6), which might affect paths.\n\nLet's list all possible paths.\n\nFirst option: turn 9 move L to (2,4) eat value 8.\n\nSnake now length 4, positions [(2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3)]\n\nHead direction L.\n\nTurn 10: I need to choose move. Let's say I move U to (2,5) for example.\n\nThen positions: [(2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)] as before.\n\nHead direction U.\n\nTurn 11: from (2,5), can move U to (2,6), L to (1,5), R to (3,5).\n\nCannot move D (reverse and body).\n\nIf I move U to (2,6), positions: head (2,6), body to (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) — [(2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)]\n\nHead direction U.\n\nTurn 12: from (2,6), can move L to (1,6) or R to (3,6), not U (wall), not D (body at (2,5)).\n\nSay move R to (3,6), positions: head (3,6), body to (2,6), (2,5), (2,4) — [(3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4)]\n\nHead direction R.\n\nTurn 13: from (3,6), can move U to (3,7) wall, no; D to (3,5), L to (2,6) but (2,6) is body, collision; R to (4,6) obstacle, death.\n\nOh! Problem.\n\nAt (3,6), on turn 13, after moving there, the only possible move was L or R, but if I moved R to (3,6), then from (3,6), I can only move L to (2,6) or D to (3,5), but (2,6) is body, and (3,5) is free? In positions, body is at (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), so (3,5) is free.\n\n(3,5) is not occupied.\n\nSo I can move D to (3,5).\n\nLet's see: from (3,6), move D to (3,5).\n\nThen head to (3,5), not eat, body: (2,6) moves to (3,6), (2,5) moves to (2,6), (2,4) moves to (2,5), so positions: [(3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5)]\n\nHead at (3,5), direction D.\n\nThen turn 14, from (3,5), can move U, D, L, R, but last move D, so cannot move U (reverse).\n\nCan move D to (3,4), L to (2,5), R to (4,5).\n\n(3,4) is free?

Positions before move: [(3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3)]\n\nMove L to (2,5), not eat.\n\nHead to (2,5)\n\nThen body: segment at (3,4) moves to previous head position (3,5)? The segment that was at index 1, (3,4), moves to where index 0 was, (3,5)\n\nBut (3,5) is a cell, so it moves to (3,5)\n\nThen segment at index 2, (3,3), moves to where index 1 was, (3,4)\n\nSegment at index 3, (4,3), moves to where index 2 was, (3,3)\n\nSo new positions: [(2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)]\n\n(4,3) is gone, tail moved.\n\nPositions: head (2,5), then (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)\n\nTail (3,3)\n\nHead direction L.\n\nTurn 11: from (2,5), can move U to (2,6), D to (2,4), L to (1,5), R to (3,5) but (3,5) is body, collision.\n\nCannot move R.\n\nU to (2,6) free, D to (2,4) free, L to (1,5) free.\n\nSay move U to (2,6), positions: head (2,6), body to (2,5), (3,5), (3,4) — [(2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4)]\n\nThen similar to before.\n\nI can survive but with only 1 point.\n\nIf I move R to (4,4) on turn 9, no eat, positions [(4,4), (3,4), (3,3)] length 3.\n\nHead at (4,4), direction R.\n\nTurn 10, can move U to (4,5), D to (4,3), R to (5,4)\n\nAll free.\n\nSay move U to (4,5), positions: head (4,5), body to (4,4), (3,4) — [(4,5), (4,4), (3,4)]\n\nTail (3,4)\n\nThen from there, I can explore, but I have no points, and the high-value food is gone.\n\nSo to maximize score, I should eat the value 8 food at (2,4).\n\nIs there any risk in eating it?\n\nThe only risk I see is that after eating, the snake is longer, but in this grid, with 35 cells, length 4 is fine.\n\nAlso, the position (2,4) is not trapped; I can move up, down, or left.\n\nFor example, on turn 10, I can move U to (2,5), or D to (2,3), or L to (1,4).\n\nMoving D to (2,3) might be better to go down.\n\n(2,3) is free.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (2,2), etc., more space.\n\nBut since no food, it doesn't matter much.\n\nBut for long-term, keeping the snake away from walls might be better.\n\nBut I think eating the 8 is the best.\n\nAnother food at (6,5) value 5, but I can't reach it this turn, so impossible.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) too far.\n\nSo only (2,4) and (3,5) are reachable.\n\n(3,5) is also reachable, but value 1.\n\nSo I think move L on turn 9 to eat (2,4).\n\nThen for the sequence, I need to provide actions for multiple turns, but since no food, I just need to survive.\n\nThe answer should be for turns: turn 9, turn 10, turn 11, etc., up to say turn 13 or 14, but the number of turns isn't specified, so I should provide a sequence for 5 turns or so.\n\nThe think 5+ turns ahead, but the output is actions for several turns starting from t1.\n\nIn the answer format, it says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to provide a sequence.\n\nBut how many? Not specified, so I'll provide for 5 turns: turns 9 to 13.\n\nFor turn 9, move L to (2,4)\n\nThen for turn 10, I need to choose a move. To avoid getting stuck, I should not go to the top row immediately.\n\nFor example, from (2,4), move D to (2,3) on turn 10.\n\nThen positions: [(2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)] after move.\n\nBefore move: [(2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3)]\n\nMove D to (2,3), not eat, so head (2,3), then body: (3,4) moves to (2,4), (3,3) moves to (3,4), (4,3) moves to (3,3), so positions: [(2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)]\n\nHead direction D.\n\nTurn 11: from (2,3), can move D to (2,2), L to (1,3), R to (3,3) but (3,3) is body, collision, U to (2,4) body.\n\nCannot move U or R, because body or reverse? Last move D, so U is reverse, not allowed.\n\nAlso, U to (2,4) is body.\n\nR to (3,3) body.\n\nSo only D to (2,2) or L to (1,3).\n\nBoth free.\n\nSay move D to (2,2), positions: head (2,2), body to (2,3), (2,4), (3,4) — [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4)]\n\nHead direction D.\n\nTurn 12: from (2,2), can move D to (2,1), L to (1,2), R to (3,2), U to (2,3) body.\n\nCannot move U.\n\nD to (2,1) free, L to (1,2) free, R to (3,2) free.\n\nSay move R to (3,2), positions: head (3,2), body to (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) — [(3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)]\n\nHead direction R.\n\nTurn 13: from (3,2), can move U to (3,3), D to (3,1), L to (2,2) body, R to (4,2).\n\nCannot move L, body.\n\nU to (3,3) free? Not occupied, (3,3) not in positions.\n\nD to (3,1) free, R to (4,2) free.\n\n Etc.\n\nSo I can survive.\n\nSimilarly, if I go other ways.\n\nSo for the sequence, I'll go with eating the high-value food.\n\nSo turn 9: L (to eat (2,4))\n\nThen for subsequent moves, I need to specify.\n\nSince the grid might have new food later, but not specified, so I'll just provide a safe sequence.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 9: L\n\nTurn 10: D (to (2,3))\n\nTurn 11: D (to (2,2))\n\nTurn 12: R (to (3,2))\n\nTurn 13: D (to (3,1)) or something.\n\nBut (3,1) is fine.\n\nTo avoid the corner, but it's ok.\n\nI could go up on turn 10, but earlier we saw it might lead to top row.\n\nBut with D, I go down.\n\nIn this case, from (2,4), moving D to (2,3) is fine.\n\nThen I have space.\n\nSo I think it's good.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I will plan a sequence of moves starting from turn \\(t_1 = 9\\). The key decision is to eat the high-value food at (2,4) with a value of 8 on turn 9, as it provides the highest immediate reward and is safely reachable. After eating, the snake grows to length 4. For subsequent turns, I will avoid risks by steering away from walls and obstacles, and ensure the snake has room to maneuver without trapping itself. I will think 5+ turns ahead (turns 9 to 14) to ensure survival.\n\n### Analysis of Turn 9 Options:\n- **Move U (to (3,5))**: Eats food with value 1, but this is low reward compared to other options.\n- **Move L (to (2,4))**: Eats food with value 8 (high reward), and the position is safe (no collision risk; head not adjacent to tail).\n- **Move R (to (4,4))**: No food eaten, misses high-value opportunity.\n- **Best choice**: Move L to eat (2,4) for +8 points. Snake grows to length 4.\n\n### Turn 10 and Beyond:\nAfter eating (2,4), the snake is at [(2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3)] with head direction L. For turn 10, moving D (down) to (2,3) is chosen to avoid the top row (which has limited space due to walls and the obstacle at (4,6)) and to explore the less crowded bottom area. Subsequent moves are planned to keep the snake safe and mobile:\n- **Turn 10**: Move D to (2,3) – no food, but safe and avoids immediate risks.\n- **Turn 11**: Move D to (2,2) – continues downward for more space.\n- **Turn 12**: Move R to (3,2) – turns right to avoid the left wall and opens up movement options.\n- **Turn 13**: Move D to (3,1) – moves to the bottom row, which is safe and allows future flexibility.\n- **Turn 14**: Move R to (4,1) – continues right along the bottom to maintain space.\n\nThis sequence ensures the snake stays away from walls, obstacles, and its own body, with no risk of collision. By turn 14, the snake is in a central-bottom position with room to explore.\n\n### Full Action Sequence:\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: L (left)  \nTurn 10: D (down)  \nTurn 11: D (down)  \nTurn 12: R (right)  \nTurn 13: D (down)  \nTurn 14: R (right)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 10.\n\nThe grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: head at (2,4), then body segments at (3,4), (3,3), and tail at (4,3). The head direction is left (L), so it's moving left.\n\nFood items:\n\n- At (3,5): value 1, life span 1. Since life span is 1, it will disappear after this turn if not eaten. Countdown decreases every turn, including current, so after turn 10, it might be gone? Life span 1 means it has 1 turn left, including the current turn. So if not eaten on turn 10, it disappears.\n\nLife span: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food with life span N, it can be eaten for N turns starting from when it appears. If life span is 1, it can only be eaten on the turn it's present; if not eaten, it vanishes after that turn.\n\nIn this case, food at (3,5) has life span 1, so it must be eaten on turn 10 or it's gone.\n\nOther food: (6,5) value 1, life span 4. So it will disappear after turn 13? Let's calculate: life span 4, countdown from turn 10, so it can be eaten on turns 10,11,12,13? Since it decreases every turn including current, after turn 10, countdown becomes 3, then 2 on turn 11, 1 on turn 12, and gone after turn 13? I need to be careful.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn t, for a food with life span L, it has L turns left including t. After t, if not eaten, countdown to L-1 for turn t+1, and so on, until countdown 0, then it disappears after that turn.\n\nBut for eating, it can be eaten as long as countdown >0.\n\nFor (3,5): life span 1, so on turn 10, countdown=1, can be eaten. If not eaten on turn 10, after turn 10, countdown=0, so it disappears, not available on turn 11.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5): life span 4, on turn 10, countdown=4, can be eaten turns 10,11,12,13. After turn 13, it disappears if not eaten.\n\n(6,4): life span 10, value 1, so it will last until turn 19.\n\nAll food has value 1, so they are all positive food, no negative food here.\n\nNow, snake head at (2,4), direction left. So from (2,4), moving left would go to (1,4).\n\nBut I need to think about possible moves.\n\nCurrent head position: (2,4)\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n\nHead direction is L, so I cannot instantly reverse to R. So opposite of L is R, so I cannot move right on this turn. So possible moves: U (up), D (down), L (left).\n\nL is the current direction, so moving left is allowed, not reverse.\n\nNo instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Since current direction is L, I cannot move R now.\n\nSo allowed moves: U, D, L.\n\nNow, let's see what each move leads to.\n\nFirst, move left (L): from (2,4) to (1,4)\n\nIs (1,4) a valid cell? Check walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So x=1 is within 1 to 6, y=4 within 1 to 6? Grid is 0 to 7, so cells x=0 and x=7 are walls, similarly y=0 and y=7 walls.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 are free? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6.\n\nBut internal obstacle at (4,6), which is within.\n\nFor (1,4): x=1, y=4. x=1 is not 0 or 7, y=4 not 0 or 7, and not (4,6), so it should be free.\n\nNow, is it occupied by snake body? Snake positions: head (2,4), then (3,4), (3,3), (4,3). So (1,4) is not in the body, so moving to (1,4) is safe for now.\n\nAfter moving, the snake: head moves to (1,4), then the body: since snake grows only when eating, no food eaten yet, so tail moves away. Current body: positions [(2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3)] after head moves to (1,4), the segment that was at (2,4) becomes part of body, so new positions: head (1,4), then (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), and tail (4,3) moves to where? When snake moves without eating, tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed.\n\nStandard snake: when moving, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and the tail position is vacated.\n\nSo from [head: (2,4), body1: (3,4), body2: (3,3), tail: (4,3)]\n\nAfter move left to (1,4):\n\nNew head: (1,4)\n\nThen body: the first body segment was at (3,4), but now it moves to where head was, (2,4)\n\nThen the next segment was at (3,3), moves to where the first body was, which is (3,4)? Let's index.\n\nPositions: index 0: head (2,4), index 1: (3,4), index 2: (3,3), index 3: tail (4,3)\n\nAfter move to (1,4):\n\nNew head: (1,4)\n\nThen index 1 moves to old head position (2,4)\n\nIndex 2 moves to old index 1 position (3,4)\n\nIndex 3 (tail) moves to old index 2 position (3,3)\n\nSo new positions: [(1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)]\n\nTail was at (4,3), now moved to (3,3), so (4,3) is free.\n\nNow, check for collisions: head at (1,4), which is not wall, not body: body positions are (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), all different, so no collision.\n\nNow, what about food? Food at (3,5), (6,5), (6,4). (1,4) has no food, so no eating.\n\nLife span: food at (3,5) has life span 1, so if not eaten now, it disappears.\n\nNow, move up (U): from (2,4) to (2,5)\n\n(2,5): x=2, y=5. y=5, borders y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=5 is between 1 and 6? y=0 and y=7 walls, so y from 1 to 6 are free? y=1 to 6, since y=0 and y=7 are walls.\n\ny=0 wall, y=7 wall, so y=1 to 6 inclusive are free.\n\nSimilarly x=1 to 6.\n\n(2,5): x=2, y=5, not wall.\n\nNot internal obstacle (4,6).\n\nSnake body: positions (2,4) is current head, moving away, so (2,5) not occupied by body? Current body: (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), none at (2,5), so safe.\n\nAfter move: head to (2,5), body: index 1 to (2,4), index 2 to (3,4), index 3 to (3,3)? Positions: old head (2,4), after move U to (2,5), new head (2,5)\n\nIndex 1 (was (3,4)) moves to old head (2,4)\n\nIndex 2 (was (3,3)) moves to old index 1 (3,4)\n\nIndex 3 (tail (4,3)) moves to old index 2 (3,3)\n\nNew positions: [(2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)]\n\nNow, is there food at (2,5)? Food at (3,5), (6,5), (6,4), not (2,5), so no eat.\n\nBut (3,5) is nearby.\n\nMove down (D): from (2,4) to (2,3)\n\n(2,3): x=2,y=3, not wall, not obstacle.\n\nBody: (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (2,3) not occupied.\n\nAfter move: head to (2,3), index 1 to (2,4), index 2 to (3,4), index 3 to (3,3)\n\nNew positions: [(2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)]\n\nNo food at (2,3), so no eat.\n\nNow, back to the food at (3,5), which must be eaten this turn or lost.\n\nTo eat it, I need to move to (3,5).\n\nCurrent position (2,4), so to reach (3,5), that would be up and right, but I can only move one cell at a time.\n\nFrom (2,4) to (3,5) is not adjacent directly; adjacent cells are (2,5) up, (2,3) down, (1,4) left, (3,4) right.\n\n(3,4) is right, but (3,4) is currently occupied by the first body segment.\n\nFood is at (3,5), which is above (3,4).\n\nTo eat (3,5), I need to move the head to (3,5).\n\nBut from (2,4), I can go to (2,5) or (3,4) or (1,4) or (2,3).\n\n(3,4) is occupied now, so if I move right to (3,4), that would be a body collision, because (3,4) is the position of the first body segment.\n\nSnake positions: head (2,4), then (3,4) is the next segment, so if I move to (3,4), head collides with body, which is deadly.\n\nSimilarly, moving to other cells.\n\nTo reach (3,5) this turn, from (2,4), I can only move to adjacent cells, so (3,5) is not adjacent; it's diagonal? No, (2,4) to (3,5) is not horizontal or vertical adjacent; adjacent are (2,5), (3,4), (2,3), (1,4).\n\n(3,5) is adjacent to (3,4) or (2,5) or (4,5), etc.\n\nBut from (2,4), I cannot reach (3,5) in one move; I need to move to an adjacent cell first.\n\nFor example, if I move up to (2,5), then from there, I can move to (3,5) next turn if possible.\n\nBut the food at (3,5) has life span 1, so only this turn, turn 10. After this turn, it disappears. So if I don't eat it on turn 10, it's gone.\n\nTherefore, I cannot eat (3,5) at all because I can't reach it this turn from (2,4) with one move.\n\nConfirm: distance from (2,4) to (3,5) is |2-3| + |4-5| = 1+1=2, so not adjacent, cannot reach in one move. So impossible to eat (3,5) on turn 10. Therefore, it will disappear after this turn.\n\nSo, effectively, (3,5) is not achievable; I should ignore it for eating.\n\nNow, other food: (6,5) and (6,4), both with longer life span.\n\n(6,5) life span 4, so can be eaten turns 10,11,12,13.\n\n(6,4) life span 10, turns 10 to 19.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves to maximize score, thinking 5+ turns ahead.\n\nAlso, avoid risks, prioritize survival.\n\nCurrent snake length: 4 segments.\n\nAfter eating, length increases.\n\nNow, possible moves this turn: U, D, L as I thought, since R is reverse and not allowed.\n\nHead direction L, so cannot move R.\n\nSo options: U, D, L.\n\nI need to simulate each option and see future possibilities.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake: head (2,4), body (3,4), (3,3), tail (4,3)\n\nSo positions: (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3)\n\nFood: (3,5) - will disappear after this turn since not reachable.\n\n(6,5) at x=6,y=5\n\n(6,4) at x=6,y=4\n\nBoth at the right edge.\n\nNow, possible moves:\n\n1. Move Left (L) to (1,4)\n\nAfter move: head (1,4), body (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)  // tail moved to (3,3), so (4,3) free.\n\nHead direction was L, now moved L, so new direction L.\n\nFood: no food at (1,4), so no eat.\n\n(3,5) disappears.\n\nAvailable food: (6,5) and (6,4)\n\nNow, from (1,4), possible moves: U, D, L, R? Head direction now L, so cannot move R (opposite).\n\nAfter moving, the new head direction is the direction moved, I assume.\n\n\"Snake Head Direction\" is given as L, and after move, it should update.\n\nSo after moving L, new direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L (since R opposite not allowed)\n\nMove to (1,5) U, (1,3) D, (0,4) L but x=0 is wall, so cannot move L to (0,4).\n\n(1,4) to left is (0,4), x=0 wall, so invalid move.\n\nSimilarly, up to (1,5), y=5, valid.\n\nDown to (1,3), y=3, valid.\n\nRight to (2,4), but (2,4) is now the first body segment? After move, positions: head (1,4), body (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)\n\nSo (2,4) is occupied by body, so moving to (2,4) would be collision.\n\nAlso, direction: current direction L, moving R would be opposite, so not allowed anyway.\n\nSo from (1,4), possible moves: U to (1,5), D to (1,3), L to (0,4) invalid, R to (2,4) but invalid due to body and direction.\n\nR to (2,4) is not allowed because it's opposite direction? Current direction L, opposite is R, so cannot move R.\n\nAlso, even if possible, (2,4) has body.\n\nSo only U or D possible from (1,4).\n\nU to (1,5): safe? (1,5) not wall, not body.\n\nBody positions: (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), all different.\n\nD to (1,3): similarly safe.\n\nNow, similarly for other moves.\n\nBut let's not go too deep yet.\n\nFirst, back to turn 10.\n\nOption 2: Move Up (U) to (2,5)\n\nFrom (2,4) to (2,5)\n\nNew head (2,5), direction U (since moved up)\n\nPositions: head (2,5), body (2,4), (3,4), (3,3) // tail moved to (3,3)? Old positions: head (2,4), body (3,4), (3,3), (4,3)\n\nAfter move U: head to (2,5)\n\nIndex 1 (was (3,4)) to (2,4)\n\nIndex 2 (was (3,3)) to (3,4)\n\nIndex 3 (tail (4,3)) to (3,3)\n\nSo new positions: [(2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)]\n\nFood at (2,5)? No, food at (3,5) but not eaten, and it disappears.\n\n(3,5) is adjacent, but not head position.\n\nNo food eaten.\n\nAvailable food: (6,5), (6,4)\n\nHead at (2,5), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R but no instant reverse, so cannot move D (down, opposite to U).\n\nSo can move U to (2,6), L to (1,5), R to (3,5)\n\n(3,5) has food? (3,5) had food but life span 1, turn 10, not eaten, so after turn 10, it disappears, so on turn 11, no food at (3,5).\n\nSimilarly, (2,6): y=6, not wall, but internal obstacle at (4,6), not here.\n\n(1,5): x=1,y=5, free.\n\n(3,5): x=3,y=5, free now, since food gone and no body.\n\nBody positions: (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), so (3,5) is free.\n\nBut moving to (3,5) might be possible, but no food there now.\n\nOption 3: Move Down (D) to (2,3)\n\nFrom (2,4) to (2,3)\n\nNew head (2,3), direction D\n\nPositions: head (2,3), body (2,4), (3,4), (3,3) // tail from (4,3) to (3,3)? Old: head (2,4), body (3,4), (3,3), (4,3)\n\nAfter move D: head to (2,3)\n\nIndex 1 to (2,4)\n\nIndex 2 to (3,4)\n\nIndex 3 to (3,3)\n\nNew: [(2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)]\n\nNo food.\n\nDirection D, so cannot move U next.\n\nPossible moves: D to (2,2), L to (1,3), R to (3,3) but (3,3) is body position? (3,3) is occupied by body, index 3? Positions: head (2,3), body (2,4), (3,4), (3,3) — so (3,3) is the last body segment.\n\nMoving to (3,3) would collide with body.\n\nAlso, direction: current D, moving U opposite not allowed, moving R to (3,3) is not opposite but to body.\n\nR to (3,3) is adjacent, but (3,3) has body, so collision.\n\nL to (1,3) possible, D to (2,2) possible.\n\nBut (2,2) y=2, valid.\n\nNow, the key point is that there is food at (6,4) and (6,5), which are on the right side.\n\nSnake is on left, at x=2, food at x=6.\n\nI need to navigate towards the food while avoiding dead ends or collisions.\n\nAlso, the tail is at (3,3) after some moves, but it moves.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (4,6), which is at y=6, x=4.\n\ny=6 is the top row, since y=7 wall, y=6 is playable but (4,6) obstacle.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should eat the food with shorter life span first, but both have value 1, so eating any is fine, but (6,5) life span 4, (6,4) life span 10, so (6,5) might be more urgent, but I have 4 turns to eat it.\n\nFrom turn 10, it can be eaten turns 10,11,12,13.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) until turn 19.\n\nBut I need to plan a path.\n\nAlso, think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving towards the food.\n\nThe food are at (6,5) and (6,4), both x=6.\n\nSnake head at (2,4), so roughly, I need to move right.\n\nBut currently, head direction is L, left, so I cannot move right this turn; only U, D, L.\n\nMoving left to (1,4) might take me away from food.\n\nMoving up to (2,5) or down to (2,3) keeps me in the area.\n\n(2,5) is closer to (3,5) but food gone.\n\nPerhaps moving up or down is better to position for future moves.\n\nLet's list all possible actions for turn 10 and their consequences.\n\nTurn 10 actions:\n\n- Move L to (1,4): as above, then from (1,4), I can only move U or D, since L to wall, R not allowed (opposite to L).\n\nFrom (1,4), direction L, so can move U to (1,5) or D to (1,3).\n\nIf move U to (1,5), then head at (1,5), direction U.\n\nThen can move U, L, R (not D).\n\nU to (1,6), L to (0,5) invalid, R to (2,5).\n\n(2,5) might be free or not, depending on state.\n\nSimilarly, if from (1,4) move D to (1,3), similar.\n\nBut this seems to be going left, away from food at right.\n\nFood at (6,5) and (6,4), so moving to (1,4) or (1,5) is far, might not reach in time for (6,5) which has only 4 turns life.\n\nFrom (2,4) to (6,5) is distance |2-6| + |4-5| = 4+1=5, so at least 5 moves away, but I can't move directly right now.\n\nSimilarly, to (6,4) |2-6| + |4-4| =4+0=4 moves away.\n\nBut with obstacles, it might take more.\n\nFor example, from (2,4), if I could move right, but I can't this turn.\n\nSo best to move up or down to be able to move right next turn.\n\nMove U to (2,5): from (2,4) to (2,5), then at (2,5), direction U, so I can move R to (3,5) next turn, since not opposite.\n\nFrom (2,5), move R to (3,5).\n\nBut (3,5) food is gone, so no eat, but I can continue to right.\n\nThen from (3,5), I can move R to (4,5), etc.\n\nSimilarly, if I move D to (2,3), then from (2,3), direction D, can move R to (3,3), but (3,3) might be occupied.\n\nAfter move D to (2,3), positions: head (2,3), body (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)\n\n(3,3) is body, so moving to (3,3) from (2,3) is R, but (3,3) occupied, collision.\n\nSo from (2,3), direction D, possible moves: L to (1,3), D to (2,2), or R to (3,3) but invalid due to body.\n\nSo only L or D, which is left or down, not towards food.\n\nTherefore, moving down to (2,3) might lead to a dead end or force me away from food.\n\nWhereas moving up to (2,5) allows me to move right to (3,5) next turn, which is free.\n\nSimilarly, moving left to (1,4) also allows moving right later, but from farther left.\n\nSo moving up seems best to position for moving right.\n\nMove L to (1,4) is worse because I have to go to y=5 or 3 first, then right, but from x=1.\n\nLet's compare the paths.\n\nFirst, action: Move U on turn 10 to (2,5)\n\nThen turn 11: from (2,5), direction U, can move U, L, R (not D)\n\n- U to (2,6): (2,6) is free? Walls: y=6 is playable, x=2, not (4,6), so free. No body.\n\n- L to (1,5): free\n\n- R to (3,5): free, since food gone and no body.\n\nBest to move R to (3,5) to go towards food.\n\nSo move R to (3,5)\n\nHead to (3,5), direction R\n\nPositions: previous head (2,5), body (2,4), (3,4), (3,3) // after move to (3,5), new head (3,5), body: index 1 to (2,5), index 2 to (3,4)? Old positions turn 11 start: head (2,5), body (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)\n\nAfter move R to (3,5): new head (3,5)\n\nThen index 1 (was (2,4)) moves to old head (2,5)\n\nIndex 2 (was (3,4)) moves to old index 1 (2,4)? Positions: index 0: (2,5), index 1: (2,4), index 2: (3,4), index 3: (3,3)\n\nAfter move: new head at (3,5)\n\nThen index 1 moves to old index 0 (2,5)\n\nIndex 2 moves to old index 1 (2,4)\n\nIndex 3 moves to old index 2 (3,4)\n\nNew positions: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)]\n\nTail was at (3,3), moved to (3,4)? Old index 3 was (3,3), moves to old index 2 position (3,4), so (3,3) free.\n\nNew tail at (3,4).\n\nNow, at (3,5), no food eaten.\n\nNow, direction R.\n\nTurn 12: from (3,5), direction R, can move U, D, R (not L)\n\n- U to (3,6): (3,6) y=6, free? Internal obstacle at (4,6), not (3,6), so free.\n\n- D to (3,4): but (3,4) is now body position? Positions: head (3,5), body (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) — so (3,4) is occupied by index 3, the tail? Index: head (3,5), index 1: (2,5), index 2: (2,4), index 3: (3,4)\n\nSo (3,4) is tail position.\n\nIf move D to (3,4), head collides with tail? But tail will move when head moves.\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving to tail position is safe, because tail moves away.\n\nSimilarly, body collision only if touching other body segments, not tail if it moves.\n\nSo move D to (3,4) is possible, and since tail is there, it will move, so no collision.\n\nThen head moves to (3,4), tail moves away, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, move R to (4,5)\n\nOr U to (3,6)\n\nNow, to go to food, (4,5) is towards (6,5).\n\n(6,5) is at (6,5), so (4,5) is closer.\n\nMove R to (4,5)\n\nThen head to (4,5), direction R\n\nPositions: from previous, after move to (4,5): new head (4,5)\n\nIndex 1 to (3,5), index 2 to (2,5), index 3 to (2,4)\n\nNew: [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)]\n\nNow, direction R.\n\nTurn 13: from (4,5), direction R, can move U, D, R (not L)\n\n- U to (4,6): but (4,6) is internal obstacle! Wall, so cannot move there.\n\n- D to (4,4): (4,4) free? Not wall, not body.\n\n- R to (5,5): (5,5) free.\n\nNow, (4,6) is obstacle, so cannot move U.\n\nSo can move D to (4,4) or R to (5,5)\n\nMove R to (5,5) towards food.\n\nHead to (5,5), direction R\n\nPositions: new head (5,5), body: index 1 to (4,5), index 2 to (3,5), index 3 to (2,5)\n\nNew: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 14: from (5,5), direction R, can move U, D, R\n\n- U to (5,6)\n\n- D to (5,4)\n\n- R to (6,5)\n\n(6,5) has food! Value 1, life span 4, but on turn 14? Current turn is turn 10, we are at turn 14 simulation.\n\nLife span of (6,5) is 4, from turn 10, so on turn 10,11,12,13 it can be eaten, turn 14 is after life span? Countdown.\n\nAt turn 10, countdown=4, can be eaten on turn 10.\n\nAfter turn 10, if not eaten, countdown=3 for turn 11.\n\nEaten on turn 11, countdown=2? Countdown decreases every turn.\n\nDefinition: \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for food with life span L at turn t, it can be eaten on turn t if countdown >=1.\n\nAfter eaten or not, countdown decreases.\n\nAt turn t, before action, food has countdown C.\n\nIf head moves to it, eaten, food gone.\n\nIf not, after turn, countdown decreases by 1, and if 0, disappears.\n\nFor (6,5): at turn 10, countdown=4\n\nIf not eaten on turn 10, after turn 10, countdown=3, available turn 11.\n\nTurn 11 not eaten, after turn 11, countdown=2, available turn 12.\n\nTurn 12 not eaten, after turn 12, countdown=1, available turn 13.\n\nTurn 13 not eaten, after turn 13, countdown=0, disappears, not available turn 14.\n\nIn simulation, at turn 14, (6,5) is gone if not eaten by turn 13.\n\nIn this path, on turn 14, moving to (6,5), but it may not be there.\n\nIn turn 13, from (4,5), I moved to (5,5) on turn 13.\n\nTurn 13: from (4,5) to (5,5), not eating (6,5).\n\n(6,5) is at (6,5), not eaten.\n\nAt turn 13, (6,5) has countdown=1? Let's track:\n\nTurn 10: (6,5) countdown=4, not eaten (in this scenario)\n\nAfter turn 10, countdown=3\n\nTurn 11: countdown=3, not eaten (moved to (3,5))\n\nAfter turn 11, countdown=2\n\nTurn 12: countdown=2, not eaten (moved to (4,5)? In turn 12, from (3,5) to (4,5), not (6,5)\n\nAfter turn 12, countdown=1\n\nTurn 13: countdown=1, can be eaten. If head moves to (6,5) on turn 13, eat it.\n\nBut on turn 13, head is at (4,5) or moving to (5,5)? In sequence:\n\nTurn 10: move to (2,5)\n\nTurn 11: move to (3,5)\n\nTurn 12: move to (4,5) — at (4,5), not (6,5)\n\nTurn 13: from (4,5) to (5,5) — not to (6,5)\n\n(5,5) to (6,5) is adjacent, but on turn 13, head at (5,5) after move, so to eat (6,5) on turn 13, need to be at (6,5) on turn 13.\n\nFrom (4,5) on turn 13? Turn 13 action from (4,5).\n\nPosition at start of turn 13: head (4,5), I can move to (5,5) or (4,4), etc.\n\n(6,5) is at x=6,y=5, from (4,5), I can move R to (5,5), but not directly to (6,5).\n\nTo reach (6,5) on turn 13, I need to be adjacent on turn 12.\n\nOn turn 12, head at (3,5), I moved to (4,5), which is not adjacent to (6,5).\n\n(4,5) to (6,5) is distance 2, cannot reach in one move.\n\nFrom (3,5) on turn 12, I could have moved differently.\n\nIn turn 12, from (3,5), direction R, I can move U to (3,6), D to (3,4), or R to (4,5).\n\n(3,4) might be available.\n\nBut to reach (6,5) faster, from (3,5) on turn 12, move R to (4,5), then turn 13 from (4,5) move R to (5,5), turn 14 to (6,5), but on turn 14, (6,5) is gone.\n\n(6,5) can only be eaten up to turn 13.\n\nTurn 13 is the last chance.\n\nTo eat on turn 13, head must be at (6,5) on turn 13.\n\nSo on turn 12, head must be adjacent to (6,5), so at (6,4), (6,6), (5,5), or (7,5) but x=7 wall, so (5,5) or (6,4) or (6,6).\n\ny=6, (6,6) is y=6, x=6, which is corner, but y=6 is playable.\n\nFrom turn 12 position (3,5), to be adjacent to (6,5) on turn 12, I need to be at (5,5) or (6,4) or (6,6) on turn 12.\n\nBut (3,5) to (5,5) is not adjacent, |3-5|=2, so not possible in one move from turn 11.\n\nTurn 11: from (2,5) to (3,5), then turn 12 from (3,5) to (4,5), not to (5,5).\n\nTo reach (5,5) by turn 12, I need to be at (4,5) on turn 11.\n\nBut on turn 11, I am at (2,5), move to (3,5), not to (4,5).\n\nFrom (2,5) on turn 11, I can only move to (1,5), (2,6), or (3,5), not directly to (4,5).\n\nSo it's impossible to reach (6,5) by turn 13 from this path, because it takes at least 4 moves: from (2,4) to (2,5) turn 10, (3,5) turn 11, (4,5) turn 12, (5,5) turn 13, then (6,5) turn 14, too late.\n\nMinimum moves: from (2,4) to (6,5) is |2-6| + |4-5| = 4+1=5 moves, so earliest turn 14, but last eat turn is turn 13, so impossible to eat (6,5) if I start from (2,4) on turn 10.\n\nTurn 10 action, then moves on 11,12,13.\n\nOn turn 10, I am at (2,4), after move on turn 10, head at new position.\n\nTo eat on turn t, head moves to food cell on turn t.\n\nFor (6,5), eat on turn t with t<=13.\n\nFrom (2,4) at turn 10 start, after turn 10 move, head at new cell.\n\nDistance to (6,5): Δx=4, Δy=1, min moves 5.\n\nSo positions: after turn 10 move, head at say P1, then turn 11 P2, turn 12 P3, turn 13 P4, then on turn 13, head at P4, to be at (6,5) on turn 13, P4 must be (6,5), so on turn 12, head must be adjacent to (6,5).\n\nBut on turn 12, head is at P3, which is after 2 moves from turn 10.\n\nFrom (2,4), after one move turn 10, head at e.g. (2,5) or (1,4) or (2,3), all have |x-6| >=4 or 5, |y-5|<=1, so to (6,5) at least 4 or 5 moves.\n\nSpecifically, from (2,5) after turn 10, |x-6|=4, |y-5|=0, so 4 moves to (6,5), so arrive on turn 14.\n\nSimilarly from (1,4) |x-6|=5, |y-5|=1, min 6 moves.\n\nFrom (2,3) |x-6|=4, |y-5|=2, min 6 moves.\n\nAll take at least 4 moves after turn 10, so arrive at (6,5) on turn 14 at earliest, but last possible eat turn is 13, so (6,5) cannot be eaten at all.\n\nSimilarly, for (6,4): life span 10, so can be eaten until turn 19, plenty of time.\n\n(6,4) at (6,4), from (2,4), Δx=4, Δy=0, so min 4 moves, arrive turn 14.\n\nCan be eaten on turn 14, within life span.\n\nNow, the other food (6,5) is not reachable in time, so I should focus on (6,4) and survival.\n\nAlso, there is the internal obstacle at (4,6), but (6,4) is at bottom right.\n\nNow, back to turn 10 actions.\n\nIf I move L to (1,4), I go left, far from food.\n\nMove D to (2,3), then I can only move L or D, which is away or down, not good.\n\nMove U to (2,5) allows me to move right towards (6,4) via (3,5), (4,5), etc., as before.\n\n(6,4) is at y=4, so from (2,5), I can go down or right.\n\nBut let's plan to eat (6,4).\n\nFirst, on turn 10, move U to (2,5)\n\nThen turn 11: from (2,5), direction U, move R to (3,5)  // towards food\n\nTurn 12: from (3,5), direction R, can move to (4,5) or (3,4) or (3,6)\n\nNow, to go to (6,4), I need to go down or right.\n\nIf I move to (4,5), as before.\n\nThen turn 13: from (4,5), move to (5,5) or (4,4)\n\n(4,4) is closer to (6,4)? (6,4) y=4, so (4,4) is better.\n\nFrom (4,5), move D to (4,4)\n\nThen head to (4,4), direction D\n\nPositions: previous turn 12: head (4,5)? Let's sequence.\n\nAfter turn 10: head (2,5), body (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)\n\nTurn 11: move R to (3,5), new head (3,5), body (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)  // index 1 to (2,5), index 2 to (2,4), index 3 to (3,4)\n\nTurn 12: from (3,5), move D to (3,4)? (3,4) is tail position, but can move there.\n\nMove D to (3,4)\n\nNew head (3,4), direction D\n\nThen body: index 1 to (3,5), index 2 to (2,5), index 3 to (2,4)\n\nNew positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)]\n\nNow, at (3,4), no food.\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 13: from (3,4), direction D, can move D, L, R (not U)\n\n- D to (3,3): (3,3) free? Not body, body are (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), so (3,3) free.\n\n- L to (2,4): but (2,4) is body position? Positions: head (3,4), body (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) — so (2,4) is occupied by index 3.\n\nMoving to (2,4) would collide, but it's tail? Index 3 is (2,4), tail.\n\nCan move to tail position? Rule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving to (2,4) is allowed, tail moves away.\n\nSimilarly, R to (4,4)\n\nOr D to (3,3)\n\nNow, to go to (6,4), move R to (4,4)\n\nHead to (4,4), direction R\n\nPositions: new head (4,4), body: index 1 to (3,4), index 2 to (3,5), index 3 to (2,5)\n\nNew: [(4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 14: from (4,4), direction R, can move U, D, R (not L)\n\n- U to (4,5): free\n\n- D to (4,3): free\n\n- R to (5,4): (5,4) free\n\n(6,4) is at (6,4), so move R to (5,4)\n\nThen head to (5,4), direction R\n\nPositions: new head (5,4), body: index 1 to (4,4), index 2 to (3,4), index 3 to (3,5)\n\nNew: [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5)]\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 15: from (5,4), direction R, move R to (6,4)\n\nHead to (6,4), which has food, value 1, life span 10, so on turn 15, countdown? Life span 10 from turn 10, so on turn 10 to 19.\n\nTurn 15: countdown = life_span - (turn - appear_turn) + something? Better to calculate remaining.\n\nAt turn 10, life span 10, countdown=10\n\nAfter each turn, if not eaten, countdown decreases.\n\nEaten on turn t, countdown at that turn must be >0.\n\nOn turn 15, from turn 10, 5 turns passed, so countdown = 10 - 5 =5? Since each turn decrease.\n\nAt turn 10, countdown=10\n\nAfter turn 10, if not eaten, countdown=9 for turn 11\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 14, if not eaten, countdown=10 - 5 =5? From turn 10 to 14, 5 turns: after 5 decreases, countdown=10-5=5 on turn 15.\n\nSo can be eaten.\n\nMove to (6,4), eat food, snake grows.\n\nWhen eating, head moves to food, and tail does not move, so length increases.\n\nSo on turn 15, move to (6,4), eat, new head (6,4), and tail stays, so positions: previous head (5,4), body (4,4), (3,4), (3,5)\n\nAfter eat: head to (6,4), body segments remain, and new tail added? Standard: when eat, head moves to food, body follows, but tail doesn't move, so new segment added at tail position? Or the tail stays.\n\nRule: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food.\n\nSo after eating, the tail does not move, so the snake grows by one segment.\n\nPositions: before move, head at (5,4), body (4,4), (3,4), (3,5)\n\nAfter move to (6,4) and eat: head at (6,4), then the body segments move to previous positions: first body to old head (5,4), second to old first body (4,4), third to old second body (3,4), and since eat, a new segment is added at the old tail position, so the tail was at (3,5), so new tail at (3,5), and the segment that was tail stays.\n\nSo new positions: head (6,4), body (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), tail (3,5)\n\nLength 5 now.\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut we are only planning for a few turns, but since the problem says think 5+ turns ahead, I need to output actions for a few turns.\n\nThe answer format is to output actions for turns starting from t1=10.\n\nHow many turns? It says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but not specified how many. Probably a few turns to show the plan.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan at least 5 turns.\n\nBut output format might be for the immediate turns.\n\nPerhaps I need to decide the sequence for the next few turns.\n\nAnother option: on turn 10, move directly towards food, but since I can't go right, move up or down.\n\nBut moving down to (2,3) might be worse, as it limits movement.\n\nEarlier with move U, I can reach (6,4) by turn 15.\n\nBut I can try to go directly.\n\nSince (6,4) is at y=4, same as start, but I have to go around.\n\nAnother point: the tail reward danger.\n\nIn this case, no food near tail, so not an issue.\n\nNow, for turn 10, moving U seems best to head towards the food area.\n\nMoving L to (1,4) is possible but takes longer to reach food.\n\nSimilarly, moving D to (2,3) then I am stuck with only L or D, which might lead to dead end.\n\nFor example, from (2,3), if I move D to (2,2), then at (2,2), direction D, can move L to (1,2), D to (2,1), or R to (3,2), but (3,2) might be free, but I am going down, away from food.\n\nThen to go to (6,4), I need to go up and right, which takes more turns.\n\nSo moving U is better.\n\nPerhaps I can eat the food at (6,4) faster by a different path.\n\nFor example, on turn 10, move U to (2,5), then turn 11 move R to (3,5), turn 12 move R to (4,5), turn 13 move D to (4,4), turn 14 move R to (5,4), turn 15 to (6,4), same as before.\n\nFrom (4,5) on turn 13, I can move directly to (5,4)? Not adjacent, must move to adjacent cells.\n\n(4,5) to (5,4) is diagonal, not allowed, only horizontal or vertical.\n\nSo must go to (4,4) or (5,5) first.\n\n(5,4) is better for (6,4).\n\nSo the path is fixed roughly.\n\nNow, back to the food at (3,5), which I can't eat, so no issue.\n\nBut in the state, there is also (6,4) with long life.\n\nNow, for the action sequence.\n\nSince I need to output for multiple turns, I should decide the first few actions.\n\nPerhaps for turn 10,11,12,13,14.\n\nBut let's confirm if moving down could be better, but I think not.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (4,6), but I am not going there, so fine.\n\nSo for turn 10, move U to (2,5)\n\nThen turn 11, move R to (3,5)\n\nThen turn 12, I need to go down to y=4.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move D to (3,4)\n\nAs I had.\n\nThen turn 13, move R to (4,4)\n\nThen turn 14, move R to (5,4)\n\nThen turn 15, move R to (6,4) and eat.\n\nBut for output, I need to specify actions from turn 10 onwards.\n\nThe answer should be for turns starting from 10.\n\nAlso, the head direction changes.\n\nIn turn 12, from (3,5), moving to (3,4) is D, which is down.\n\nThen direction D.\n\nThen to (4,4) is R, which is not opposite, so allowed.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTo avoid the tail issue, but it should be fine.\n\nI could go via (4,5) but then to (4,4) later.\n\nBut going to (3,4) directly is fine.\n\nNow, for the life span of (6,4), it can be eaten later, but I can eat it on turn 15.\n\nBut since I think 5 turns ahead, turn 10 to 14 actions, then on turn 15 I eat.\n\nBut the output might not need to include eating turn.\n\nNow, another point: on turn 10, if I move D to (2,3), what happens.\n\nMove D to (2,3), then positions: head (2,3), body (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen turn 11: from (2,3), direction D, can move D to (2,2), L to (1,3), or R to (3,3) but (3,3) is body? Positions: head (2,3), body (2,4), (3,4), (3,3) — (3,3) is tail, so can move to (3,3), tail moves away.\n\nMove R to (3,3)\n\nThen head to (3,3), direction R? Moved right, so direction R.\n\nBody: index 1 to (2,3), index 2 to (2,4), index 3 to (3,4)\n\nNew: [(3,3), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4)]\n\nNo food.\n\nThen turn 12: from (3,3), direction R, can move U to (3,4) but (3,4) is body? Positions: head (3,3), body (2,3), (2,4), (3,4) — (3,4) is occupied, but it's tail? Index 3 is (3,4), tail.\n\nCan move to (3,4)? Yes, since tail moves.\n\nMove to (3,4)\n\nThen head to (3,4), direction U? Moved up? From (3,3) to (3,4) is up, y+1, so U.\n\nDirection U.\n\nBody: index 1 to (3,3), index 2 to (2,3), index 3 to (2,4)\n\nNew: [(3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4)]\n\nThen turn 13: from (3,4), direction U, can move U to (3,5), L to (2,4) but (2,4) is body, can move to tail? Index 3 is (2,4), tail, so can move to (2,4).\n\nOr R to (4,4), etc.\n\nBut to go to (6,4), from here, I need to go right, but I am at (3,4), similar to before but with different body positions.\n\nThen I can move to (4,4), etc., but it takes more turns because I went down first.\n\nFor example, from (3,4) on turn 13, move R to (4,4), then same as before.\n\nBut I started from turn 10 move D, so I lost a turn going down, so I reach (6,4) later.\n\nTurn 10: to (2,3)\n\nTurn 11: to (3,3)\n\nTurn 12: to (3,4)\n\nTurn 13: to (4,4)  // if move R\n\nThen turn 14: to (5,4)\n\nTurn 15: to (6,4)\n\nSame as before, but with move U path, I was at (4,4) on turn 13? In move U path: turn 10 U to (2,5), turn 11 R to (3,5), turn 12 D to (3,4), turn 13 R to (4,4), so at (4,4) on turn 13, same as here turn 13 at (4,4) with move D path.\n\nIn move D path: after turn 13 at (4,4)\n\nThen turn 14 to (5,4), turn 15 to (6,4)\n\nSame as move U path: turn 13 at (4,4), turn 14 to (5,4), turn 15 to (6,4)\n\nIn move U path, turn 12 I was at (3,4), turn 13 to (4,4)\n\nSimilarly in move D path, turn 12 at (3,4), turn 13 to (4,4)\n\nBut in move U path, I went via (2,5) and (3,5), while in move D path, I went via (2,3) and (3,3).\n\nThe position at turn 12 is similar, but the body might be different, but for reaching (6,4), same number of moves.\n\nHowever, in the move D path, when I moved to (3,3) and (3,4), I might have had to move through the tail, but it was safe.\n\nBut both paths take the same time to reach (6,4).\n\nBut in move U, I have the option to go to other places, but here it's similar.\n\nBut in move D, initially, from (2,3), I could only move to limited directions, but I managed to go right.\n\nNow, the difference is that in move U, from (2,5), I could potentially go to (3,6) or something, but not necessary.\n\nBut both are possible, but moving up might be better because the grid has obstacle at (4,6), which is top, so going up might be riskier, but (2,6) is free.\n\nIn this case, not an issue.\n\nBut since the food is at y=4, moving down directly might seem better, but I can't because of the direction.\n\nOn turn 10, moving down to (2,3) is possible.\n\nBut let's see the risk.\n\nAnother thing: the tail reward danger, but no food on tail.\n\nI think moving U or D both can work, but moving U might be slightly better because it avoids going to the bottom where y=0 wall, but not necessary.\n\nPerhaps I should choose one.\n\nSince the head direction is L, and I need to go right, moving up or down allows me to change direction to right next turn.\n\nMoving left takes me away.\n\nSo I should not move left.\n\nSo options U or D.\n\nNow, between U and D, moving up to (2,5) is fine.\n\nSimilarly, moving down to (2,3) is also fine.\n\nBut in the move down case, at (2,3), when I move to (3,3), it was tail, fine.\n\nThen to (3,4), etc.\n\nNo problem.\n\nBut let's see if there is a reason to prefer one.\n\nThe food at (6,4) is at y=4, so moving down to (2,3) then up to (3,4) might be inefficient, but same moves.\n\nFrom (2,4), move D to (2,3), then to (3,3), then to (3,4), that's two moves to reach (3,4), whereas from (2,4) move U to (2,5), then to (3,5), then to (3,4), also two moves to (3,4), but at (3,5) instead of (3,3).\n\nBut (3,4) is the key point.\n\nIn both cases, I reach a position adjacent to the start in x, but different y.\n\nThen from there to (4,4), etc.\n\nSame.\n\nBut to avoid the internal obstacle, but (4,6) is not in the way.\n\nSo I think both U and D are acceptable, but since the grid is open, moving U might be better to have more space.\n\nMoving to (2,3) is closer to bottom wall, but not immediately dangerous.\n\nBut to decide, let's output the sequence with move U.\n\nFor the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe problem says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the output format is to list actions for turns starting from t1.\n\nProbably for a few turns to demonstrate the plan.\n\nSince it says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" I think I should provide a sequence for say 5 turns.\n\nBut after that, I need to reach the food.\n\nPerhaps for turn 10 to 14.\n\nIn my plan with move U:\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: R\n\nTurn 12: D  // to (3,4)\n\nTurn 13: R  // to (4,4)\n\nTurn 14: R  // to (5,4)\n\nThen turn 15: R to (6,4) eat.\n\nBut for output, I can do up to turn 14.\n\nSince think 5 turns ahead, from turn 10, turns 11,12,13,14,15, but 5 turns ahead might be turns 11 to 15, but actions from turn 10.\n\n\"Think 5+ turns ahead\" means considering the future 5 turns from now.\n\nSo from turn 10, think about turns 10 to 15.\n\nBut for action, I need to specify the action for each turn starting from 10.\n\nI think I'll provide actions for turn 10 to 14.\n\nSo sequence: Turn 10: U, Turn 11: R, Turn 12: D, Turn 13: R, Turn 14: R\n\nThen on turn 15, R to eat.\n\nBut in the output, it's fine.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nAnother thing: on turn 12, when I move D to (3,4), it was tail, but safe.\n\nI could move directly to (4,5) on turn 12, but (4,5) is not closer to (6,4).\n\n(4,5) to (6,4) needs to go down, so better to go to (3,4) first.\n\nIn turn 12 from (3,5), moving D to (3,4) is fine.\n\nSo I think this is a good plan.\n\nTherefore, for turn 10, move U.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating the positive food at (6,4) with value 1 and life span 10, while avoiding risks and prioritizing long-term survival, the AI must plan at least 5 turns ahead (turns 10 to 15). The food at (3,5) cannot be eaten on turn 10 due to distance and its life span of 1, so it disappears after this turn. The food at (6,5) has a life span of 4 but cannot be reached by turn 13 (the last possible turn to eat it), so it is ignored. The path focuses on reaching (6,4) safely by turn 15.\n\n### Key Considerations for the Plan:\n- **Current Head Direction (L)**: On turn 10, moving opposite (R) is not allowed, so possible moves are U, D, or L.\n- **Food Accessibility**: \n  - (3,5): Cannot be eaten on turn 10 (distance too far), disappears after turn 10.\n  - (6,5): Minimum 5 moves from (2,4), but last eat turn is 13; arrival on turn 14 is too late, so ignored.\n  - (6,4): Life span 10 allows eating by turn 19; min 4 moves from (2,4), so it can be reached by turn 14 or 15.\n- **Obstacles and Collisions**: \n  - Walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacle at (4,6) must be avoided.\n  - Body collisions are deadly, but moving into the tail position is safe as the tail moves.\n  - Moving left (L) on turn 10 leads to a dead-end area and delays reaching (6,4), so it is avoided.\n  - Moving down (D) on turn 10 is possible but less efficient; moving up (U) provides a clearer path to (6,4) with fewer risks.\n- **Path to (6,4)**: \n  - Turn 10: Move U to (2,5) to position for rightward movement.\n  - Turn 11: Move R to (3,5) to head toward the right side.\n  - Turn 12: Move D to (3,4) to align with y=4 for efficient movement to (6,4). Moving to (3,4) is safe as it is the tail position, and the tail moves away.\n  - Turn 13: Move R to (4,4) to continue toward (6,4).\n  - Turn 14: Move R to (5,4) to approach (6,4).\n  - Turn 15: Move R to (6,4) to eat the food (arrives on turn 15 with countdown 5, within life span).\n- **Risk Avoidance**: \n  - The path avoids walls, obstacles, and body collisions. For example, on turn 12, moving to (3,4) leverages the tail rule for safety.\n  - No negative food or tail reward danger exists in this state.\n  - The grid is navigated to keep options open and minimize dead-ends.\n\n### Action Sequence (Turns 10 to 14):\nThe sequence below ensures the snake moves efficiently toward (6,4) while surviving. Actions are chosen to maintain flexibility and avoid immediate risks. Thinking 5+ turns ahead confirms that (6,4) can be eaten by turn 15.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 11: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 12: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 13: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 14: R (right)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 11, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The walls are at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (4,6). So, the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but since walls are at the borders, the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n\nThe border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning those coordinates are walls. So, the snake can only be in cells where x from 1 to 6 and y from 1 to 6, except for the internal obstacle at (4,6). (4,6) is a wall, so it's blocked.\n\nSnake positions: head at (2,5), then (2,4), (3,4), (3,3). So the snake has 4 segments. Head direction is Up, meaning it was moving upwards to reach (2,5) from (2,4)? Positions are given with head first, so from turn 10 to 11, it moved from (2,4) to (2,5), since it was at (2,4) before and now head at (2,5) with direction U. Direction U means it's facing up, so y increasing.\n\nIn coordinates, (x,y), U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), L is (x-1,y), R is (x+1,y). So from (2,4) to (2,5) is U, yes.\n\nNow food: there are two food items:\n\n- (6,5) with value 1 and life span 4. So it disappears after 4 turns, including this turn? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 11, life span 4, so it will disappear after turn 14? Let's see: turn 11: life span 4, after this turn, it decreases to 3, then turn 12:3, turn 13:2, turn 14:1, turn 15:0? But it disappears after N turns, so if life span is N at turn t, it will be gone by turn t + N? I need to be careful.\n\nThe rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn 11, life span is 4, meaning it has 4 turns left including turn 11. After turn 11, life span becomes 3, after turn 12:2, after turn 13:1, after turn 14:0, so it disappears at the start of turn 15 or after turn 14? Typically, it should be that at the beginning of each turn, if life span is 0, it's gone. But let's read.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – so on turn 11, when we see it, life span is 4, which means after this turn (turn 11), it decreases to 3, and so on. So it will be present for 4 more turns: turns 11,12,13,14. On turn 15, it's gone.\n\nSimilarly for the other food: (6,4) with value 1 and life span 9. So it has 9 turns left, disappearing after turn 19 or something. But since we're only thinking 5 turns ahead, it might not matter.\n\nBoth foods have value 1, so positive food.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns. But the answer format should show actions starting from turn 11, then 12, etc., up to some point. It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the output should be a sequence of actions for several turns.\n\nThe format is: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, etc. I need to decide how many turns to output. Since it says \"maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks\" and \"prioritize long-term survival\", I should plan a sequence that gets me to eat food safely.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, but walls at borders, so playable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake: head at (2,5), body: (2,4), (3,4), (3,3). So positions:\n\n- Head: (2,5)\n\n- Segment 1: (2,4)\n\n- Segment 2: (3,4)\n\n- Segment 3: (3,3)  // tail\n\nDirection is U, so it just moved up to (2,5).\n\nPossible moves from (2,5):\n\n- Up (U): to (2,6)\n\n- Down (D): to (2,4) but (2,4) is occupied by body segment 1. But can I move there? Movement constraints: cannot move into body except the tail, because the tail will move.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nAlso, \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is U, so opposite is D. So I cannot move down to (2,4) because it's opposite direction and also occupied by body.\n\nIf I move down to (2,4), that would be into a body segment that is not the tail. The tail is at (3,3), so (2,4) is the first body segment, not tail. So moving there would cause collision.\n\nMoreover, even if it were tail, moving opposite is not allowed.\n\nSo from (2,5), possible moves:\n\n- U to (2,6)\n\n- L to (1,5)\n\n- R to (3,5)\n\nCannot D because opposite and occupied.\n\nNow, check walls: (2,6) is y=6, which is not border? Border walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable, since walls at y=0 and y=7, so cells y=1 to y=6 are playable? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so coordinates from y=1 to y=6 are free, except obstacles.\n\ny=0 and y=7 are walls, so the grid rows are y=0 (wall), y=1 to y=6 (playable), y=7 (wall). Similarly for x.\n\nx=0 and x=7 walls, so x=1 to x=6 playable.\n\nSo (2,6) is at y=6, which is playable, not wall.\n\n(1,5): x=1, playable.\n\n(3,5): x=3, playable.\n\nNow, what about (4,6)? That's an obstacle, but (4,6) is at x=4,y=6, which is different from (2,6).\n\n(2,6) is clear.\n\nNow food: one at (6,5), value 1, life span 4. So available for turns 11,12,13,14.\n\nAnother at (6,4), value 1, life span 9.\n\nBoth are on the right side.\n\nI need to think about eating them.\n\nFirst, let's consider the immediate move.\n\nFrom head at (2,5), possible actions: U, L, R.\n\nIf I go U to (2,6): that's the top row, y=6. Then from there, I can move to adjacent cells.\n\nBut let's see the grid state.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the tail. Tail is at (3,3), and when I move, the tail moves forward, so after I move from (2,5) to some direction, the new positions will be: new head at new position, then the body follows, so tail moves to where the last body was? Snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the tail end moves to the next position, but since it's a list, the body shifts.\n\nAfter moving, the new snake positions: if I move to new_head, then the body is [old_head, old_body1, old_body2, ...] but the last segment is removed if no food eaten, or added if food eaten.\n\nRule: when you eat food, length increases, so tail doesn't move, new head position and body stays, but a new segment is added at the tail position? No.\n\nStandard snake: when you move, if you don't eat food, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front, so the tail segment is removed from that cell. If you eat food, head moves to food, body segments move as before, but tail doesn't move, so a new segment is added at the position where tail was, so length increases.\n\nIn terms of positions: suppose positions [H, B1, B2, T]. After move without eating: new positions [H_new, H, B1, B2] so tail was at T, now B2 is new tail, and T cell is free.\n\nAfter move with eating: [H_new, H, B1, B2, T] so tail stays, length increases.\n\nIn this case, snake has 4 segments: index 0: head (2,5), 1: (2,4), 2: (3,4), 3: tail (3,3).\n\nIf I move and don't eat food, new head at new position, then body: [new_head, (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)] and tail (3,3) is gone, so (3,3) becomes free.\n\nIf I eat food, new head at food position, body: [new_head, (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)] so tail stays, and (3,3) is still occupied.\n\nNow back to possible moves from (2,5):\n\nOptions:\n\n1. U to (2,6)\n\n2. L to (1,5)\n\n3. R to (3,5)\n\nNow, I need to evaluate these for safety and potential to eat food.\n\nFirst, let's see where the foods are: (6,5) and (6,4). Both at x=6, y=5 and y=4.\n\nCurrently head at (2,5), so (6,5) is 4 units right, same y. (6,4) is 4 right, 1 down.\n\nBut there are obstacles and the snake body.\n\nAlso, internal obstacle at (4,6), which might block paths.\n\nSince I need to think 5 turns ahead, I should simulate possible paths.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving towards the food.\n\nBut both foods are at (6,5) and (6,4), which are close to each other.\n\n(6,5) has shorter life span, only 4 turns left, so I might want to eat it soon.\n\nTurn 11: life span 4, so if I don't eat it by turn 14, it's gone.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) has life span 9, so more time.\n\nBut eating (6,5) might be risky because of the tail or something.\n\nFirst, let's check if I can go directly to (6,5).\n\nFrom (2,5), if I go right multiple times: to (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5). But is the path clear?\n\nCells: from (2,5) to (3,5): that's adjacent, move R.\n\n(3,5) is currently empty? Current positions: snake at (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3). So (3,5) is free.\n\nThen from (3,5) to (4,5): (4,5) should be free, no snake or obstacle. Obstacle at (4,6), not (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is free.\n\n(5,5) free, (6,5) has food.\n\nBut when I move to (6,5), I eat the food.\n\nNow, how many moves? From (2,5) to (3,5) in one move, then to (4,5), then to (5,5), then to (6,5). So 4 moves: turn 11,12,13,14.\n\nTurn 11: move to (3,5)\n\nTurn 12: to (4,5)\n\nTurn 13: to (5,5)\n\nTurn 14: to (6,5) and eat.\n\nLife span of (6,5) is 4 at turn 11, so after turn 11, it decreases to 3, turn 12:2, turn 13:1, turn 14:0? At turn 14, when I move to it, is it still there?\n\nLife span countdown: at turn 11, life span 4, present.\n\nAfter turn 11 action, life span decreases to 3, so at start of turn 12, life span 3.\n\nSimilarly, after turn 12, to 2; turn 13 to 1; after turn 14 action, it decreases to 0 and disappears, but during turn 14, it is still there with life span 1.\n\nSo on turn 14, I can move to (6,5) and eat it before it disappears.\n\nYes.\n\nBut I need to get there safely.\n\nNow, if I go right to (3,5) on turn 11.\n\nBut from (2,5), moving R to (3,5).\n\nIs that safe? (3,5) is free now, but after I move, the snake body changes.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the direction.\n\nCurrent head direction is U, but moving R is not opposite, so allowed.\n\nNo instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current is U, moving R is right, not down, so ok.\n\nAfter moving to (3,5), new snake positions: head at (3,5), then body: (2,5), (2,4), (3,4). Tail was (3,3), which is now free because we didn't eat food.\n\nOld positions: [ (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3) ]\n\nAfter move R to (3,5), no food eaten, so new positions: head (3,5), then previous head (2,5) becomes body, then (2,4), then (3,4). The last segment (3,3) is removed, so (3,3) free.\n\nSo new snake: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)]\n\nHead direction now R.\n\nThen from there, I can move to (4,5) on turn 12.\n\n(4,5) is free? Currently, no one there.\n\nAfter move to (4,5), new positions: head (4,5), body (3,5), (2,5), (2,4). Tail (3,4) removed.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut when I reach (6,5) on turn 14, I eat the food, so length increases to 5.\n\nBut is there any risk?\n\nAlso, I need to think about after that.\n\nAnother food at (6,4), which is below.\n\nBut let's see the other moves.\n\nOption L to (1,5): that's left, to x=1,y=5. Then I might be going away from food.\n\nU to (2,6): up to y=6.\n\n(2,6) is free? Current positions: nothing at (2,6), and no obstacle except (4,6) which is different.\n\n(2,6) is playable.\n\nIf I go U to (2,6), then new positions: head (2,6), body (2,5), (2,4), (3,4). Tail (3,3) removed.\n\nHead direction U.\n\nThen from (2,6), I can move U, but y=6 is the top, so U to (2,7) is wall, cannot. y=7 is wall, so (2,7) invalid.\n\nSo from (2,6), possible moves: D, L, R.\n\nD to (2,5) but (2,5) is now body, and moving down is opposite to current direction U? Current direction after move is U? After moving to (2,6), head direction is U.\n\nThen moving D to (2,5) is opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo cannot move down.\n\nL to (1,6), or R to (3,6).\n\n(1,6) is x=1,y=6, playable.\n\n(3,6) is x=3,y=6, but (4,6) is obstacle, but (3,6) is different.\n\n(3,6) should be free.\n\nBut if I go U first, I might get stuck or something.\n\nNow, back to the food plan.\n\nI also need to consider the tail reward danger.\n\nRule: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nIn this case, tail is at (3,3), head at (2,5), not adjacent. Adjacent would be same x, y±1 or same y, x±1.\n\n(2,5) and (3,3): dx=1, dy=2, not adjacent.\n\nSo no issue now.\n\nBut if later the tail has food and head is adjacent, eating it would be bad.\n\nBut here no food on tail.\n\nNow, for the path to (6,5): if I go right directly.\n\nBut let's see if there are obstacles or body in the way.\n\nFrom (2,5) to (6,5): row y=5, x from 3 to 6.\n\nCells: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)\n\n(3,5): free now\n\n(4,5): free\n\n(5,5): free\n\n(6,5): food\n\nBut after I start moving, the body changes.\n\nFor example, on turn 11, if I move R to (3,5), new snake: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)]\n\nNow (4,5) is free.\n\nTurn 12: move R to (4,5), new positions: head (4,5), body (3,5), (2,5), (2,4). (3,4) removed.\n\nNow (5,5) free.\n\nTurn 13: move R to (5,5), new positions: head (5,5), body (4,5), (3,5), (2,5). (2,4) removed.\n\nTurn 14: move R to (6,5), eat food. Since food eaten, new positions: head (6,5), then body: previous head (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), and tail stays, so (2,5) becomes part of body? Let's see.\n\nBefore move: positions [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]  // after turn 13, head (5,5), body (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nAfter moving to (6,5) and eating food: head moves to (6,5), body: the previous head (5,5) becomes new body segment, then (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), and since food eaten, the tail doesn't move, so a new segment is added at the position of the old tail? No.\n\nStandard: when you eat food, the tail position remains occupied, so the new segment is added where the tail was, but since the tail doesn't advance, the length increases.\n\nPositions: after move, new head at (6,5), then the previous positions except the tail is not removed, so [ (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) ] and the old tail (2,5) is now part of body, with a new tail at (2,5)? I'm confusing myself.\n\nLet's think of the list.\n\nBefore move at turn 14: snake positions: [head: (5,5), seg1: (4,5), seg2: (3,5), tail: (2,5)]\n\nWhen head moves to (6,5), since (6,5) has food, we eat it.\n\nSo new head at (6,5).\n\nThen the body segments: the first body segment moves to where head was, (5,5), second body segment moves to where first was, (4,5), tail moves to where second was, (3,5). But since we ate food, the tail doesn't move, so we add a new segment at the position where the tail was before moving? I need clarity.\n\nRule: \"when eating food, length of snake +1, so tail remains, new head position.\"\n\nIn terms of cells: the cell where the tail was remains occupied, and head moves to new cell.\n\nIn positions: suppose positions [H, B1, B2, T]\n\nAfter moving to new cell and eating food: [new_H, H, B1, B2, T]  // T remains, so positions include new head, old head, and all body, with tail still there.\n\nSo length increased by one.\n\nIn this case: before move: [ (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) ]  // head, seg1, seg2, tail\n\nAfter move to (6,5) with food: new positions [ (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) ]  // so tail is still (2,5), but now it's a body segment, and the new tail is (2,5)? No, in the list, the last element is the tail.\n\n[ (6,5) head, (5,5) body, (4,5) body, (3,5) body, (2,5) tail ]\n\nYes.\n\nAnd the cell (2,5) is still occupied, but it was already occupied before.\n\nAnyway, back to the point.\n\nIn this path, I can reach (6,5) on turn 14 and eat it.\n\nBut is it safe? During the path, all cells are free, no collision.\n\nBut after eating, I'm at (6,5), with the snake stretching back to (2,5), which might block some areas.\n\nBut I have another food at (6,4), which is below.\n\n(6,4) has life span 9, so I can go for it after.\n\nBut let's see other options for turn 11.\n\nIf I go U to (2,6), what happens?\n\nTurn 11: move U to (2,6), new positions: head (2,6), body (2,5), (2,4), (3,4). Tail (3,3) removed.\n\nHead direction U.\n\nNow from (2,6), I can only move L or R, since D is opposite and not allowed, U to (2,7) wall.\n\nSay I move R to (3,6).\n\n(3,6) is free? No obstacle, no snake.\n\nThen turn 12: move R to (3,6), new positions: head (3,6), body (2,6), (2,5), (2,4). (3,4) removed? Before move: after turn 11, positions [ (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) ] tail (3,4)\n\nAfter move to (3,6): new head (3,6), body (2,6), (2,5), (2,4). Tail (3,4) removed.\n\nNow head at (3,6), direction R.\n\nFrom (3,6), possible moves: U to (3,7) wall, not possible; D to (3,5); L to (2,6) but (2,6) is body now; R to (4,6) but (4,6) is obstacle! Internal obstacle at (4,6), so cannot move there.\n\nSo only possible move is D to (3,5).\n\n(3,5) should be free now.\n\nTurn 13: move D to (3,5), new positions: head (3,5), body (3,6), (2,6), (2,5). (2,4) removed.\n\nNow head at (3,5), direction D.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can go to (4,5) or other, but I'm at (3,5), and food at (6,5) is still there, but it's turn 13, life span of (6,5) was 4 at turn 11, so at turn 13, after decrease, life span should be 2? Turn 11:4, after turn 11:3, turn 12:2 (after action), turn 13:1, so on turn 13, life span 1, present.\n\nI can try to go to (6,5) from (3,5).\n\nFrom (3,5) to (4,5) to (5,5) to (6,5), but turn 13: at (3,5), move to (4,5) on turn 13? Turn 13 action: from (3,5) to (4,5), then turn 14 to (5,5), turn 15 to (6,5) but on turn 15, (6,5) is gone, since after turn 14 it disappears.\n\nLife span: turn 11:4, after turn 11:3, turn 12:2, turn 13:1, after turn 13:0, so at turn 14, it is gone. On turn 13, it is present with life span 1, so I can move to it on turn 13 if I can.\n\nFrom (3,5) on turn 13, (6,5) is at x=6,y=5, I'm at x=3,y=5, so I need to go right three times, but I only have one move on turn 13 to reach it? No, I can move to (4,5) on turn 13, but (6,5) is not adjacent, so I can't reach it on turn 13 from (3,5).\n\nOn turn 13, I'm at (3,5), (6,5) is three steps away, so I can move to (4,5) on turn 13, then on turn 14 to (5,5), then on turn 15 to (6,5), but on turn 15, (6,5) is gone.\n\nSo I cannot eat (6,5) if I go up first.\n\nSimilarly, if I go left first, same issue.\n\nSo only by going right immediately can I eat (6,5).\n\nNow, what about the other food (6,4)? I can eat that later.\n\nBut let's check if going right has any risk.\n\nFrom (2,5) to (3,5) on turn 11.\n\nThen to (4,5) on turn 12.\n\n(4,5) is free, no issue.\n\nBut there is an obstacle at (4,6), which is above, but since I'm at y=5, it might not affect directly.\n\nAfter eating (6,5) on turn 14, I'm at (6,5) with snake positions: after eating, [ (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) ]\n\nHead at (6,5), direction R.\n\nNow, from here, I can consider eating (6,4).\n\n(6,4) is at (6,4), which is directly below (6,5).\n\nBut if I move down to (6,4), is it safe?\n\nFirst, (6,4) has food, so I can eat it.\n\nBut tail is at (2,5), not adjacent.\n\nHowever, after moving down to (6,4), since I eat food, length increases to 6.\n\nPositions: before move at turn 14 after eating (6,5): snake at [ (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) ]\n\nTurn 15: move D to (6,4), which has food, so eat it.\n\nNew positions: head (6,4), body (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5). Length 6.\n\nNow, I have eaten both foods.\n\nBut is there a problem?\n\nThe grid might be getting crowded.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (4,6), but I'm at bottom.\n\nBut I need to think about future moves to avoid trapping myself.\n\nSince both foods are eaten, I need to find more food, but there might be no other food now, so I should survive.\n\nBut the goal is to maximize score, so eating both is good.\n\nBut let's see if I can do it safely.\n\nIn this path, on turn 11, I move R to (3,5).\n\nBut is there a risk of collision or dead end?\n\nFor example, after turn 14, I'm at (6,5), and the snake occupies x=2 to 6, y=5, all in a row.\n\nThen moving down to (6,4) is fine.\n\nBut (6,4) was food, so I eat it.\n\nNow, positions: head (6,4), body (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nNow, from (6,4), possible moves: U to (6,5) but (6,5) is body, and moving up might be opposite? Direction after moving down to (6,4) is D, so moving U to (6,5) is opposite, not allowed.\n\nL to (5,4), or R to (7,4) but x=7 is wall, cannot.\n\nD to (6,3), but y=3, playable.\n\nSo I can move L to (5,4) or D to (6,3).\n\n(5,4) might be free or not.\n\nAfter turn 15, positions: [ (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) ]\n\nSo (5,4) is free? Let's see cells: (6,4) head, (6,5) body, (5,5) body, etc., so (5,4) is not occupied, should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) free.\n\nSo I can move to (5,4) or (6,3).\n\nNo immediate danger.\n\nBut the area might be tight.\n\nI need to consider if I had moved differently.\n\nAnother option: from (2,5), I could go L to (1,5).\n\nBut that might take me away from food.\n\nFor example, turn 11: move L to (1,5), new positions: head (1,5), body (2,5), (2,4), (3,4). Tail (3,3) removed.\n\nHead direction L.\n\nThen from (1,5), I can move L to (0,5) but x=0 wall, cannot; U to (1,6); D to (1,4); R to (2,5) but (2,5) is body, and moving R is opposite to L? Current direction L, moving R to (2,5) is opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo possible: U to (1,6) or D to (1,4).\n\nSay go D to (1,4): then new positions, and so on.\n\nBut then I might not reach (6,5) in time, since it's farther.\n\nSimilarly, going U first as before, I couldn't reach (6,5).\n\nSo the direct right seems best to get the food with short life.\n\nBut there is another food at (6,4) with longer life, so I could go for that instead, but (6,5) has shorter life, so better to eat it first.\n\nMoreover, (6,4) is below, so after eating (6,5), I can go down to (6,4).\n\nBut in the sequence above, on turn 14 I eat (6,5), then turn 15 I can eat (6,4).\n\n(6,4) life span 9 at turn 11, so after several turns it decreases, but since I eat on turn 15, let's see: turn 11:9, after 11:8, ..., after 14:5, turn 15:4? At turn 15, life span should be 4, present.\n\nTurn 11: life span 9\n\nAfter turn 11: 8\n\nTurn 12:7\n\n...\n\nTurn 15: after turn 15 action, it decreases to 4? Let's count:\n\nAt turn t, life span L.\n\nAfter turn t, L decreases by 1.\n\nSo at turn 11: L=9\n\nAfter turn 11: L=8\n\nAt turn 12: L=8 (before action? or after?)\n\nThe state is given at the start of turn.\n\nAt start of turn t, life span is given.\n\nAfter action on turn t, life span decreases.\n\nSo for (6,4): at turn 11, life span 9, so present.\n\nAfter turn 11 action, decreases to 8.\n\nAt start of turn 12, life span 8.\n\nAfter turn 12 action, to 7.\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 14 action, to 5? Turn 11 after:8, turn12 after:7, turn13 after:6, turn14 after:5? Then at start of turn 15, life span 5.\n\nThen on turn 15, I can eat it, life span decreases after action, but since I eat during the action, it should be fine.\n\nYes.\n\nSo in the plan, I can eat both.\n\nBut in the sequence, after eating (6,5) on turn 14, I'm at (6,5), then on turn 15 move D to (6,4) and eat.\n\nNow, but on turn 15, after moving to (6,4), positions: head (6,4), body (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nNow, from here, I need to move to avoid collision.\n\nFor example, I can move L to (5,4) or D to (6,3).\n\nSay move L to (5,4).\n\nThen no food, so new positions: head (5,4), body (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5). Tail (2,5) removed? Before move: positions [ (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) ] head, then body.\n\nAfter move to (5,4) without eating: new head (5,4), body: (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5). The last segment (2,5) is removed.\n\nSo snake: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)] and (3,5) tail? Positions: new head (5,4), then the previous head (6,4) becomes body, then (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), and the last (3,5) becomes tail? List: [ (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) ]? No.\n\nPrevious positions: index 0: head (6,4), 1: (6,5), 2: (5,5), 3: (4,5), 4: (3,5), 5: (2,5) // since length 6 after eating.\n\nAfter turn 15 eating (6,4): positions [ (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) ]\n\nThen turn 16: move to (5,4), no food (assume), so new head at (5,4), then body: previous head (6,4), then (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5). The tail (2,5) is removed.\n\nSo new snake: [ (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) ] and tail (3,5)? Segments: head (5,4), body1 (6,4), body2 (6,5), body3 (5,5), body4 (4,5), tail? The last position is (4,5) or (3,5)?\n\nAfter removing tail, the new positions are: new head at (5,4), then the first body segment is where old head was (6,4), second body is where first body was (6,5), third body is where second was (5,5), fourth body is where third was (4,5), and the old tail (2,5) is gone, so we have five segments: [ (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) ] with head (5,4), tail (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is tail.\n\nNow, (3,5) is free.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can move to other places.\n\nNo problem.\n\nBut back to turn 11 decision.\n\nI think going right is good.\n\nBut what about the internal obstacle at (4,6)? It hasn't affected me since I'm at y=5.\n\nAnother thing: in the beginning, when I move to (3,5) on turn 11, is there any risk?\n\n(3,5) is free, no issue.\n\nBut let's see the tail position.\n\nTail is at (3,3), which is not near.\n\nAlso, the body at (3,4) is there, but when I move to (3,5), it's above, not colliding.\n\nThen on turn 12 to (4,5), etc.\n\nAll seems fine.\n\nBut I need to think 5+ turns ahead, so up to turn 16 or so.\n\nIn this plan:\n\nTurn 11: R to (3,5)\n\nTurn 12: R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 13: R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 14: R to (6,5) eat\n\nTurn 15: D to (6,4) eat\n\nNow, after that, I need to move away.\n\nBut since the question is to output actions for several turns, I should output these.\n\nBut I need to specify the sequence.\n\nThe answer format should be for turns starting from t1=11.\n\nAlso, for each turn, the action.\n\nIn turn 15, I move D to (6,4), but I need to confirm it's possible.\n\nDirection after turn 14: when I move to (6,5) with R, head direction is R.\n\nThen moving D to (6,4) is not opposite? Opposite of R is L, not D. Directions: U and D opposite, L and R opposite.\n\nSo moving down is perpendicular, not opposite, so allowed.\n\nNo problem.\n\nThen on turn 15, move D.\n\nBut I don't need to output more, but since I think ahead, it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if there is a better move.\n\nAnother option: what if on turn 11 I go U to (2,6), but as before, I might not get the food, and I could go for (6,4) directly.\n\n(6,4) has longer life, so I can reach it later.\n\nFor example, from (2,5), go U to (2,6), then R to (3,6), then D to (3,5), then right, but I might miss (6,5).\n\nSince (6,5) disappears soon, better to get it.\n\nMoreover, going up might lead to dead end or something.\n\nFor example, after (3,6), I can only go down to (3,5), as before.\n\nThen from (3,5), I can go to (6,4) or something.\n\n(6,4) is at (6,4), from (3,5) I can go right and down.\n\nBut (6,5) will be gone.\n\nSo score would be less.\n\nThus, going right immediately is better.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (6,4) first, but it's farther and life longer, so better to get the one expiring soon.\n\nNow, but in the movement, when I go to (3,5) on turn 11, the cell (3,5) is free, but is there any food that might appear? But no, only given foods.\n\nAlso, the special case: food can spawn under body, but here no such thing, foods are at (6,5) and (6,4), not under snake.\n\nSnake is at (2,5),(2,4),(3,4),(3,3), so (6,5) is clear.\n\nAnother thing: tail reward danger, but not applicable now.\n\nSo I think the sequence is safe.\n\nTherefore, for turn 11: move R to (3,5)\n\nThen turn 12: move R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 13: move R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 14: move R to (6,5) eat\n\nThen turn 15: move D to (6,4) eat\n\nBut after turn 14, I need to move on turn 15.\n\nIn the sequence, I should output actions for turns 11 to 15 or more.\n\nBut the food at (6,4) might not be eaten on turn 15 if I don't move there, but in this plan I do.\n\nPerhaps I can output up to turn 15.\n\nBut let's see how many turns: from 11 to 15 is 5 turns.\n\nThink 5+ turns ahead, so 5 is fine.\n\nTo be safe, I can include turn 16.\n\nBut not necessary.\n\nNow, in the answer format, I need to write:\n\nTurn 11: R\n\nTurn 12: R\n\nTurn 13: R\n\nTurn 14: R\n\nTurn 15: D\n\nBut on turn 15, moving to (6,4) to eat.\n\nIs there a reason not to?\n\nAfter eating (6,5) on turn 14, I'm at (6,5), and (6,4) is directly below, with food, so eating it is good, +1 score.\n\nIf I don't, I might lose it later, but life long.\n\nBut since it's there, and I can eat immediately, better to eat.\n\nIf I move left or something, I might not get it.\n\nSo yes.\n\nPerhaps from (6,5), I could move left or down, but down has food, so better.\n\nNow, but on turn 15, if I move D, I eat.\n\nBut let's confirm the tail danger or something.\n\nHead at (6,5), tail at (2,5), not adjacent.\n\nAfter moving to (6,4), tail at (2,5) or wherever.\n\nIn positions after turn 14: [ (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) ] tail (2,5)\n\nHead at (6,5), tail at (2,5), not adjacent.\n\nMove D to (6,4), eat, then new head (6,4), body (6,5), (5,5), etc., tail (2,5) still, but not adjacent to head.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, the action sequence:\n\nTurn 11: R\n\nTurn 12: R\n\nTurn 13: R\n\nTurn 14: R\n\nTurn 15: D\n\nBut I need to write it in the boxed format.\n\nThe answer should be for the current turn and future.\n\nSince it says \"action on turn t1\", etc.\n\nAlso, directions: U, D, L, R.\n\nIn the state, head direction is U, but after moves, it changes.\n\nBut I don't need to output direction, just action.\n\nSo for turn 11: R (right)\n\nTurn 12: R\n\nTurn 13: R\n\nTurn 14: R\n\nTurn 15: D (down)\n\nNow, should I include more turns? For example, after turn 15, I might move to (5,4) or something, but since no food, and to avoid risks, I can, but not necessary for the output.\n\nI think 5 turns are enough.\n\nTo think ahead, after turn 15, I'm at (6,4), then I can move L to (5,4) or D to (6,3), both free, so I can choose, say, L to (5,4) to go away from the wall.\n\nBut no need to specify.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n\nBut let's double-check the life span.\n\n(6,5) life span 4 at turn 11.\n\nIf I don't move towards it, it might disappear.\n\nIn this sequence, I eat it on turn 14, which is within life.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) eaten on turn 15, life span 9 at turn 11, after 4 turns, at turn 15 it should be 5, still there.\n\nAfter turn 11: 8, turn12:7, turn13:6, turn14:5, turn15:4? At start of turn 15, life span 4 (since after turn 14 decrease), so yes.\n\nSo all good.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if moving down on turn 15 is necessary, but it is to eat the food.\n\nIf I don't, I might not get another chance, but it's fine.\n\nSo I think this is the plan.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating the positive food at (6,5) before it disappears (life span 4 at turn 11, so must be eaten by turn 14) and then eating the food at (6,4) (life span 9 at turn 11, so plenty of time), while prioritizing long-term survival, the snake should move directly right toward (6,5) for four turns, eating it on turn 14. Then, on turn 15, move down to eat (6,4). This sequence ensures both foods are eaten safely within their life spans and avoids collisions or dead ends. The path is clear, with no obstacles or body segments blocking the way during the moves. After eating both foods, the snake has grown and can move to open areas to avoid trapping itself.\n\n### Reasoning:\n- **Turn 11 (current state)**: Snake head at (2,5), direction Up. Possible moves: Up (to (2,6)), Left (to (1,5)), or Right (to (3,5)). Moving Right is chosen to start the path toward (6,5). The cell (3,5) is free, and moving Right is allowed (not opposite to current Up direction).\n- **Turn 12**: Snake head at (3,5), direction Right. Move Right to (4,5), which is free and safe.\n- **Turn 13**: Snake head at (4,5), direction Right. Move Right to (5,5), which is free and safe.\n- **Turn 14**: Snake head at (5,5), direction Right. Move Right to (6,5), eating the food (+1 score, length increases to 5). The food at (6,5) is eaten just before it disappears (life span decreases to 0 after turn 14).\n- **Turn 15**: Snake head at (6,5), direction Right. Move Down to (6,4), eating the food (+1 score, length increases to 6). The move Down is perpendicular to the current Right direction, so it is allowed. The food at (6,4) is safely eaten with life span still remaining (4 at start of turn 15).\n\n### Safety and Risk Avoidance:\n- **Collision Avoidance**: All target cells ((3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)) are free during the moves. No body collisions occur because:\n  - Moving into the tail is only dangerous if eating food when head is adjacent to tail, but the tail is never adjacent to the head during this sequence.\n  - Wall collisions are avoided as all moves stay within playable area (x=1-6, y=1-6) and avoid the internal obstacle at (4,6).\n- **Life Span Management**: The food at (6,5) is prioritized due to its short life span (4 turns), ensuring it is eaten. The food at (6,4) has a longer life span, so eating it on turn 15 is efficient.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: After turn 15, the snake can move left (e.g., to (5,4)) or down (e.g., to (6,3)) to explore open areas, avoiding the crowded right side. The grid has space to maneuver, and no immediate risks are present after eating both foods.\n\nThis plan achieves a score increase of +2 by eating both foods while ensuring survival for at least 5 turns ahead.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: R (right)\nTurn 12: R (right)\nTurn 13: R (right)\nTurn 14: R (right)\nTurn 15: D (down)\n}",

        "step": 12,
        "score": 3,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 12. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) to (7,7) inclusive? Since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, that means the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. Let me confirm.\n\nThe walls are at x=0 and x=7, meaning those columns are walls, and similarly for y=0 and y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (4,6). So, cells that are walls: all (0,y) for y=0 to 7, all (7,y) for y=0 to 7, all (x,0) for x=0 to 7, all (x,7) for x=0 to 7? No, that would make the corners double-walled, but it's fine. The border cells are given as x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, so any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. Plus internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSo playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except where there are obstacles. Internal obstacle at (4,6), so (4,6) is also a wall.\n\nSnake positions: head at (3,5), then (2,5), (2,4), (3,4). So the snake has 4 segments. Head direction is right, so it was moving right to get to (3,5) from previous position. Since positions are given as [(x0,y0), (x1,y1), ...] with head first, and head direction is R, meaning it just moved right to (3,5), so previous head was at (2,5)? Let's see: positions are (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4). If head is at (3,5) and direction is R, that means it came from left, so from (2,5) to (3,5), so the body segments are: after head, (2,5) is the first body segment, which was the previous head, then (2,4), then (3,4) is the tail.\n\nThe snake is moving right, so from turn 11 to turn 12, it moved from (2,5) to (3,5). Now, for turn 12, I need to decide the action.\n\nFood: two items:\n\n- (6,5) with life span 3, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (6,4) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 12, for (6,5) life span 3, meaning it will disappear after 3 more turns? Let's read: \"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo, at the time of state, life span is given, and it decreases each turn, including the current turn when we are deciding.\n\nCurrent turn is t1=12. Food at (6,5) has life span 3, so after 3 turns, it will disappear. That means it will be gone after turn 14? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n\nSo, at turn 12, life span 3, meaning it can be eaten on turns 12, 13, 14? Let's think carefully.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\". I think \"after N turns\" means after N more turns from now.\n\nFor example, if life span is N at turn t, it will disappear at the end of turn t + N - 1? Or at the start of turn t + N?\n\nThe rule says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nPerhaps it's better to think that the countdown is the number of turns it will remain, including the current turn.\n\nSo, at turn t, if life span is L, it can be eaten on turn t, and then L decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, and so on, until L=0, it disappears before turn t+L or something.\n\nStandard way: if life span is L at turn t, it means it will be present for L turns, from turn t to turn t+L-1, and disappear at turn t+L.\n\nFor (6,5) at turn 12, life span 3: it can be eaten on turns 12, 13, 14. After turn 14, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) life span 8: present from turn 12 to turn 19, disappear at turn 20.\n\nBoth are positive food, value +1, so eating either will increase length by 1.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns. The answer should be a sequence of actions starting from turn 12.\n\nBut I need to output for turn 12, turn 13, etc., up to some point, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the output can be multiple turns, I think as many as I can reasonably plan.\n\nThe answer format is to box the sequence of actions for turns starting from t1.\n\nNow, snake head at (3,5), direction R. So possible moves: since direction is R, I can move U, D, R, but not L, because L is opposite to R, and no instant reverse.\n\nCurrent direction is R, so I cannot move L (left) on next turn.\n\nPossible actions: U (up), D (down), R (right). L is not allowed.\n\nNow, let's see the grid. Playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except walls.\n\nWalls: borders, so x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6 are playable, except internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is a wall, so not accessible.\n\nSnake body: positions (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4). So cells occupied: (3,5) head, (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) tail.\n\nNow, food at (6,5) and (6,4).\n\n(6,5) is at x=6,y=5. Since walls at x=7, but x=6 is playable? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 are playable. Similarly y=0 and y=7 walls, y from 1 to 6 playable.\n\nSo (6,5) is at the right border, but x=6 is not wall, since wall is x=7. x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to x=6 are free, except if obstacle.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) is playable.\n\nNow, head at (3,5), food at (6,5) which is 3 steps to the right, since same y, x from 3 to 6.\n\nDistance: from (3,5) to (6,5), delta x=3, delta y=0.\n\nBut there might be obstacles or body in the way.\n\nFirst, let's find possible moves from (3,5) for turn 12.\n\nHead at (3,5), direction R.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U (up): to (3,6)\n\n- D (down): to (3,4)\n\n- R (right): to (4,5)\n\nNow, check if these are safe.\n\nFirst, (3,6): is it a wall? y=6, but walls are at y=7, so y=6 is playable. y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 to 6 playable. (3,6) should be playable. But is there obstacle? Internal obstacle at (4,6), not (3,6). (4,6) is wall, but (3,6) is fine.\n\nNow, is (3,6) occupied by body? Snake body: (3,5) head, (2,5), (2,4), (3,4). (3,6) is not in the list, so free.\n\nBut (3,6) might be where food is? Food is at (6,5) and (6,4), not at (3,6). So (3,6) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4): is it occupied? Snake positions: (3,4) is the tail. Tail is at (3,4).\n\nWhen the snake moves, the tail will move, so moving to (3,4) might be safe or not, depending.\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, moving to the tail cell is allowed because the tail moves away, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, for body, if it's not tail, it would cause collision, but tail is ok.\n\nIn this case, (3,4) is the tail, so moving to (3,4) is safe; after move, head goes to (3,4), tail moves away.\n\nNow, (4,5): x=4,y=5. Not wall, not occupied by body? Body: (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4). (4,5) not in list, so free.\n\nBut (4,5) is adjacent to obstacle? Obstacle at (4,6), but (4,5) is fine.\n\nNow, also, need to consider the direction for future moves.\n\nI should think about getting to the food.\n\nFood at (6,5) has short life span, only 3 turns including turn 12, so it must be eaten by turn 14.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) has longer life.\n\nSince both are positive, I should try to eat (6,5) first because it will disappear soon.\n\nBut I need to get to (6,5) from (3,5).\n\nPath: directly right to (4,5), (5,5), (6,5). But is that clear?\n\nCells: from (3,5) to (4,5) to (5,5) to (6,5).\n\nNow, are these cells occupied or blocked?\n\nCurrently, at turn 12, snake occupies (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4).\n\n(4,5) is empty.\n\n(5,5) should be empty, no food or anything mentioned.\n\n(6,5) has food.\n\nBut when I move, the snake body moves.\n\nAlso, after eating, the snake grows.\n\nBut let's plan the moves.\n\nFirst, to reach (6,5) by turn 14 or earlier.\n\nFrom (3,5) at turn 12.\n\nIf I move right to (4,5) on turn 12.\n\nThen on turn 13, from (4,5), I can move right to (5,5).\n\nThen on turn 14, from (5,5) to (6,5), eat the food.\n\nLife span of (6,5) is 3 at turn 12, so on turn 12, it can be eaten, life span decreases to 2 at turn 13, to 1 at turn 14, disappears after turn 14. So eating on turn 14 is possible.\n\nIf I can reach earlier, but from (3,5), I can only move one step per turn, so earliest to (6,5) is turn 14 with three right moves.\n\nTurn 12: to (4,5)\n\nTurn 13: to (5,5)\n\nTurn 14: to (6,5)\n\nNow, is this path clear?\n\nAt turn 12, after moving to (4,5), snake positions: head at (4,5), then body: (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), tail (3,4) moves? When head moves to (4,5), the tail end is removed if no food eaten, so new positions: head (4,5), then previous head (3,5) becomes body, then (2,5), then (2,4), and (3,4) is removed since no growth. Snake length remains same unless food eaten.\n\nSo after turn 12 move to (4,5), snake: [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)]? Positions: head at (4,5), then the segments: after head, it should be the previous head, which was (3,5), then next is (2,5), then (2,4), but (3,4) was tail, it is removed. So snake is now at (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4). Length 4.\n\nThen turn 13, move to (5,5): head to (5,5), body: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), tail (2,4) removed? When head moves to (5,5), the tail moves from (2,4) to... the segments: head (5,5), then (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), and (2,4) removed, so new tail is (2,5)? Positions: after move, head at (5,5), then the segment that was behind head is (4,5), then (3,5), then (2,5), since (2,4) is no longer part of snake. So snake: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nThen turn 14, move to (6,5): head to (6,5), eat food, so snake grows: head at (6,5), body: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), and since food eaten, a new segment is added at the tail, so tail becomes (2,5) and new tail? When food eaten, the tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n\nRule: when food eaten, length increases by one, so the tail stays in place or something? No.\n\nStandard snake: when head eats food, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move for that turn, or a new segment is added.\n\nThe rule says: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food.\n\nAnd for movement: when moving, if no food eaten, head moves to new cell, tail moves out of last cell.\n\nIf food eaten, head moves to food cell, tail does not move, so a new segment is added.\n\nIn terms of positions, if head moves to a food cell, the tail remains, so the snake gains one segment.\n\nOtherwise, head moves, tail moves.\n\nIn this case, on turn 14, head moves to (6,5) which has food, so it eats, length increases to 5, positions: head (6,5), then previous body (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), and tail stays, so (2,5) is still there.\n\nAfter eating, the tail doesn't move, so the segments are: head at new position, then the previous segments all remain, with the last one still there.\n\nSo from turn 13 positions: head (5,5), body (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nAfter moving to (6,5) and eating, head (6,5), then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) — all kept, length 5.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, back to turn 12 choices.\n\nIf I move right to (4,5) on turn 12, it seems fine.\n\nBut I have other options: up or down.\n\n(3,6) is up: y=6, which is the top row, but y=6 is playable since walls at y=7 and y=0, so y=1 to 6 are playable.\n\n(3,6) is empty, as we said.\n\nDown to (3,4): which is currently the tail. Moving to (3,4) is safe because tail moves away.\n\nIf I move down to (3,4), what happens?\n\nTurn 12: move D to (3,4). But (3,4) is the current tail position.\n\nAfter move: head moves to (3,4), and since no food eaten, tail moves out. Current positions: head (3,5), body (2,5), (2,4), tail (3,4)\n\nAfter moving down to (3,4), head is now at (3,4), and the tail (3,4) was occupied, but since tail moves away, it's ok.\n\nNew positions: head at (3,4), then the segment behind head: since head was at (3,5) and moved down to (3,4), so the new body segments: previous head (3,5) becomes first body, then (2,5), then (2,4), and the tail (3,4) is removed? When head moves to a new cell, the tail cell is vacated.\n\nSpecifically: the snake moves by adding a new head and removing the tail, unless food eaten.\n\nSo, from positions [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)] , move down to (3,4).\n\nBut (3,4) is the current tail. So when head moves to (3,4), that cell is now head, and since no food, the tail is removed, which was (3,4), but now head is there, so the tail to remove is the last segment, which is (3,4), but head is moving to it, so it might be confusing.\n\nTypically, in snake, when head moves to the tail cell, since tail moves away simultaneously, it's safe.\n\nAfter move: new head position (3,4), and the body segments are the previous positions except the tail is removed.\n\nPrevious positions: index 0: head (3,5), index 1: (2,5), index 2: (2,4), index 3: tail (3,4)\n\nAfter moving down, new head at (3,4), which was index 3. Then the new body: the previous head (3,5) becomes body, then (2,5), then (2,4), and the tail (3,4) is removed, but since new head is at (3,4), it's occupied, but the tail cell is vacated only if not eaten, but here head is moving to the tail cell, so effectively, the snake shortens or something? I think I have a confusion.\n\nStandard way: the head moves to a new cell. If that cell was the tail, then since tail moves away, the cell is free for head to move in, and after move, the tail is gone, so the snake has one less segment temporarily? No.\n\nLet's think: positions before move: [H: (3,5), B1: (2,5), B2: (2,4), T: (3,4)]\n\nMove head to (3,4), which is the current tail position.\n\nAfter move, the new head is at (3,4). The body segments are: the previous head (3,5) is now the first body segment, then B1 (2,5) is second body, then B2 (2,4) is now the tail, because the old tail (3,4) is where the head is, so it's no longer tail; the new tail is the last segment that was not moved from, which is (2,4).\n\nSo new positions: head (3,4), body (3,5), (2,5), tail (2,4).\n\nLength same, 4 segments.\n\nAnd (3,4) is now head, (3,5) is body, etc.\n\nNo problem.\n\nSimilarly, if I move up to (3,6).\n\n(3,6) is free, so head to (3,6), body: (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), tail (3,4) removed, so new tail (2,4).\n\nPositions: head (3,6), body (3,5), (2,5), tail (2,4).\n\nNow, back to the food.\n\nIf I want to eat (6,5), moving right directly is good.\n\nBut is there any risk?\n\nAt turn 12, if I move right to (4,5), that should be fine.\n\nThen turn 13 to (5,5), turn 14 to (6,5) eat.\n\nBut on turn 14, when I move to (6,5), I eat, snake grows.\n\nNow, after that, I have the other food at (6,4) with longer life span.\n\n(6,4) is below (6,5).\n\nAfter eating at (6,5), head at (6,5), body at (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) as before.\n\nThen I could move down to (6,4) to eat that food as well, but (6,4) has life span 8, so no rush.\n\nBut I should think long-term.\n\nThere might be a problem with the tail.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (6,5) is at the border, x=6, which is adjacent to wall at x=7, but since x=6 is playable, it's fine.\n\nBut after moving to (6,5), I have limited moves because x=6 is right border, so I can only move up, down, or left, not right.\n\nSimilarly, y=5, not border.\n\nNow, possible moves from (6,5): U to (6,6), D to (6,4), L to (5,5).\n\n(6,6): y=6, playable, but is there obstacle? Internal obstacle at (4,6), not (6,6), so (6,6) should be free.\n\n(6,4) has food, which I can eat.\n\n(5,5) is where the body is, after we move to (6,5), body includes (5,5), so I cannot move to (5,5) because it's occupied by body.\n\nAfter turn 14, positions: head (6,5), body (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nSo cells occupied: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nSo from (6,5), moving left to (5,5) is occupied by body, so collision.\n\nMoving down to (6,4) is possible, and it has food.\n\nMoving up to (6,6) is possible, empty.\n\nBut (6,4) has food, so moving down to (6,4) would eat it immediately.\n\nBut life span is long, so I don't have to eat it now, but since it's there, I can eat it to grow.\n\nBut I need to think about survival.\n\nAnother point: the food at (6,4) might be under the body or something, but currently, body is not there.\n\nAt turn 12, food at (6,4), no body.\n\nBut after snake moves, it might be covered.\n\nBut in this case, when I am at (6,5), (6,4) is empty except for food.\n\nIf I move down to (6,4), I eat it, snake grows to length 6.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nFirst, for turn 12, I should move right to (4,5) to go for the food.\n\nBut is there a reason not to?\n\nAnother option: I could go down to (3,4) or up to (3,6).\n\nBut (3,4) is current tail, moving there is fine, but it might not help for food.\n\nSimilarly, up to (3,6), then I am farther from food.\n\nSince (6,5) has short life, I should prioritize it.\n\nMoreover, moving right seems direct.\n\nBut let's check if (4,5) is safe.\n\nAt turn 12, moving to (4,5): is it a wall? No. Occupied? No, as positions show only (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4). (4,5) free.\n\nThen after move, as above.\n\nNow, turn 13, from (4,5), I need to move to (5,5).\n\nFrom (4,5), direction is now R (since moved right).\n\nPossible moves: U, D, R. Cannot L.\n\n(4,6) is up, but (4,6) is an internal obstacle, wall, so I cannot move to (4,6).\n\n(4,4) is down, but y=4, playable.\n\n(5,5) is right.\n\n(4,4) is down.\n\nNow, (4,4): is it occupied? Current positions after turn 12: head (4,5), body (3,5), (2,5), (2,4). (4,4) is not occupied, should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) free.\n\nBut (4,6) is wall, so cannot go up.\n\nSo from (4,5), I can move D to (4,4) or R to (5,5).\n\nI need to go to (5,5) to reach food.\n\nSo move R to (5,5).\n\nThen turn 14 to (6,5).\n\nAll seems fine.\n\nBut after that, when I am at (6,5), I have to move down or up, since left is body.\n\nMoving down to (6,4) to eat the other food.\n\nBut (6,4) has food, so I can eat it.\n\nThen snake grows.\n\nBut let's think further.\n\nAfter eating at (6,5), head at (6,5), body (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nIf I move down to (6,4), head to (6,4), eat food, so snake grows: head (6,4), body (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) — tail doesn't move, so length 6.\n\nThen from there, I need to move away.\n\nPossible moves from (6,4): U to (6,5) but (6,5) is now body, occupied, so collision.\n\nD to (6,3), y=3, playable.\n\nL to (5,4), x=5,y=4.\n\n(6,3) down, (5,4) left.\n\nNow, (6,5) is body, so cannot go up.\n\n(6,3) and (5,4) should be free.\n\nBut I need to survive.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (6,4) was eaten, but there might be other foods later, but not given, so only these two for now.\n\nBut the state has only these foods, but in general, more might spawn, but not specified, so I should work with current.\n\nTo maximize score, I should eat both if possible.\n\nIn this case, by turn 15, I can eat both.\n\nTurn 12: R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 13: R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 14: R to (6,5) eat first food, now length 5, positions: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nTurn 15: move D to (6,4) eat second food, now length 6, positions: head (6,4), body (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nThen from (6,4), I can move D to (6,3) or L to (5,4).\n\n(6,3) is down, (5,4) left.\n\nBoth should be free.\n\nFor example, move L to (5,4), then head at (5,4), and so on.\n\nBut is there any danger?\n\nAt turn 15, after moving to (6,4), the tail is at (2,5), which is far.\n\nBut I need to avoid trapping myself.\n\nAfter being at (6,4), if I move left to (5,4), then positions: head (5,4), body (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), tail (2,5) removed? No, when moving to (6,4) and eating, tail doesn't move, so positions after eating at turn 15: head (6,4), body (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) — all kept.\n\nThen if I move left to (5,4), no food, so head to (5,4), tail (2,5) removed.\n\nNew positions: head (5,4), body (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), and (3,5) now tail? Segments: previous head (6,4) becomes first body, then (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), and tail (2,5) removed, so new tail is (3,5).\n\nSo positions: (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nNow, from (5,4), I can move to other places.\n\nBut I should plan beyond.\n\nThe problem is to think 5+ turns ahead, so from turn 12 to turn 17 or so.\n\nBut I need to output actions starting from turn 12.\n\nAnother thing: in the beginning, I have the option to not go directly for food.\n\nFor example, if I move up or down on turn 12.\n\nBut (6,5) has short life, so I should go for it.\n\nBut let's see if there is a risk with the tail or something.\n\nAnother rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\nIn this case, at turn 12, tail is at (3,4), head at (3,5), so they are adjacent vertically.\n\nBut (3,4) does not have food; food is at (6,5) and (6,4), so no issue.\n\nAfter moves, similarly.\n\nFor example, when I am at (5,5) on turn 13, tail is at (2,4) or something, not adjacent.\n\nLet's not worry.\n\nPerhaps I should consider moving down to (3,4) to avoid something, but I don't see why.\n\nAnother point: the internal obstacle at (4,6), which is above (4,5), but since I can't go up from (4,5) anyway, it's fine.\n\nSo moving right seems good.\n\nBut let's list all possible actions for turn 12.\n\n- Move U to (3,6): then I am at (3,6), farther from food. From there, to reach (6,5), I need to go right or down, but it might take more turns. For example, from (3,6), I can go to (4,6) but (4,6) is wall, cannot. So from (3,6), possible moves: D to (3,5), but (3,5) is body after move? After moving to (3,6), positions: head (3,6), body (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) — tail (3,4) removed.\n\n(3,5) is body, so I cannot move back to (3,5) because it's occupied.\n\nFrom (3,6), I can move R to (4,6) but wall, no. Or L to (2,6), or D to (3,5) but occupied.\n\n(2,6): x=2,y=6, playable? x=2 between 1-6, y=6 playable.\n\n(2,6) should be free.\n\nD to (3,5) but (3,5) is now body, so cannot move there.\n\nU cannot, y=6, up would be y=7 wall.\n\nSo from (3,6), possible moves: L to (2,6) or R to (4,6) but (4,6) wall, so only L to (2,6).\n\nThen at (2,6), I can move down or left, etc. But this is away from food, and (6,5) will disappear soon, so I might miss it.\n\nSimilarly, moving down to (3,4) on turn 12: to (3,4), which was tail.\n\nAfter move, head (3,4), body (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) as before.\n\nFrom there, I can move to (3,3) or (4,4) or (2,4) but (2,4) is body? Positions: head (3,4), body (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) — (2,4) is tail? After move, segments: head (3,4), then (3,5), (2,5), tail (2,4).\n\nSo (2,4) is tail.\n\nFrom (3,4), possible moves: U to (3,5) but (3,5) is body, occupied, cannot.\n\nD to (3,3) if playable.\n\nL to (2,4) but (2,4) is tail, moving to tail is allowed.\n\nR to (4,4).\n\n(3,3) down, (2,4) left, (4,4) right.\n\nAll possible, but (2,4) is tail, so moving there is safe.\n\nBut again, not directly towards food.\n\nTo reach (6,5) from (3,4), I need to go up or right, but up to (3,5) is body, so I have to go right or down first, then it takes more turns.\n\nFor example, move R to (4,4) on turn 12 from (3,4), but I am at (3,4) only if I moved down.\n\nAssume turn 12 move D to (3,4).\n\nThen turn 13, from (3,4), I can move R to (4,4).\n\nThen turn 14, from (4,4) to (5,4) or to (4,5), etc.\n\nTo (6,5), from (4,4), I need to go to (5,4) or (4,5), then to (5,5), etc., but (6,5) might disappear before I reach.\n\nLife span 3 at turn 12, so after turn 14 it disappears. Turn 14 is the last chance.\n\nAt turn 12, I am at (3,4) if I moved down.\n\nTurn 13: from (3,4), move to say (4,4)\n\nTurn 14: from (4,4), I can move to (5,4) or (4,5).\n\nIf to (4,5), then to (5,5) on turn 15, but (6,5) gone by turn 15? Disappears after turn 14, so on turn 15 it's not there.\n\nSo to eat on turn 14, I need to be at (6,5) on turn 14.\n\nFrom (3,4) at turn 12, after move.\n\nAfter turn 12 move D to (3,4), head at (3,4).\n\nOn turn 13, if I move R to (4,4), head at (4,4).\n\nThen on turn 14, from (4,4) to (4,5) or to (5,4), but not to (6,5) directly; I need two moves: to (5,4) or (4,5), then to (5,5), but (5,5) is not (6,5).\n\nFrom (4,4) to (6,5) in one move? No, minimum two moves: e.g., to (5,4) then (6,4), but not (6,5).\n\nTo reach (6,5) from (4,4), I need at least two moves: say to (5,5) then (6,5), but from (4,4) to (5,5) is diagonal, not adjacent; I can only move orthogonally.\n\nFrom (4,4), adjacent cells: (4,5), (4,3), (5,4), (3,4) but (3,4) might be body.\n\n(4,5) up, (5,4) right, etc.\n\n(4,5) is above, (5,4) right.\n\nNeither is (6,5); (6,5) is two steps away.\n\nSo from (4,4) at turn 14, I cannot reach (6,5) on turn 14; I can only reach (4,5), (5,4), etc., not (6,5).\n\nTherefore, if I don't go directly towards (6,5) on turn 12, I might miss it.\n\nFor example, if I move up to (3,6) on turn 12, similarly, I cannot reach (6,5) by turn 14.\n\nOnly by moving right immediately can I reach it on turn 14.\n\nTherefore, for turn 12, moving right is the best to get the food.\n\nMoreover, after that, I can get the other food easily.\n\nNow, about the other food at (6,4), with longer life span, I can eat it later, but in the sequence above, I eat it on turn 15.\n\nBut I don't have to; I could leave it for later, but since it's positive, I should eat it to grow.\n\nBut eating it immediately might not be necessary, but in this case, it's convenient.\n\nAfter being at (6,5) on turn 14, I could move up to (6,6) instead of down to (6,4).\n\nThen from (6,6), I can move left or down.\n\nBut (6,4) has food, so moving down to eat it is better, I think.\n\nIf I move up to (6,6) on turn 15, then (6,4) might be there, but I can eat it later.\n\nBut no reason to delay.\n\nMoreover, moving down to (6,4) is safe.\n\nBut let's confirm the grid.\n\ny=6 is the top row, (6,6) is corner, but not wall.\n\nFrom (6,6), I can move D to (6,5) but body, or L to (5,6), or cannot U or R.\n\n(5,6) should be free.\n\nBut (6,4) is below.\n\nBut since (6,4) has food, better to go down.\n\nNow, back to planning multiple turns.\n\nI need to output actions for several turns.\n\nSince I have to think 5+ turns ahead, I should plan a sequence.\n\nStart from turn 12.\n\nTurn 12: move R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 13: from (4,5), move R to (5,5) — since I need to go to (6,5), and (4,6) is wall, so only right or down, but down to (4,4) is away, so right is best.\n\nTurn 14: move R to (6,5), eat food, now length 5.\n\nNow turn 15: from (6,5), I can move D to (6,4) to eat the other food.\n\nBut (6,4) has food, so yes.\n\nAfter eating, length 6.\n\nThen turn 16: from (6,4), I need to move to safe cell.\n\nPossible: D to (6,3) or L to (5,4).\n\nBoth should be free.\n\nSay, move L to (5,4) for example.\n\nBut I need to specify.\n\nSince no more food, I should explore the grid to find more, but not given, so I need to survive.\n\nAlso, the snake body might cause issues later.\n\nBut for now, let's plan up to turn 17 or so.\n\nTurn 16: from (6,4) after eating, head at (6,4), body (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nIf I move L to (5,4), no food, so head to (5,4), tail (2,5) removed.\n\nNew positions: head (5,4), body (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), and (3,5) tail? Segments: previous head (6,4) becomes first body, then (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), tail removed, so new tail (3,5).\n\nPositions: (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nNow turn 17: from (5,4), possible moves: U to (5,5) but (5,5) is body, occupied.\n\nD to (5,3), if playable.\n\nL to (4,4)\n\nR to (6,4) but (6,4) is body.\n\nSo only D or L.\n\n(5,3) down, y=3 playable.\n\n(4,4) left.\n\nBoth should be free.\n\nSay move L to (4,4).\n\nThen and so on.\n\nBut I need to output the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, when I move to (6,4) on turn 15, I eat the food, so on turn 15, I should specify the action.\n\nBut in the answer format, I need to list actions for each turn starting from t1=12.\n\nSo for turn 12: R\n\nTurn 13: R\n\nTurn 14: R\n\nTurn 15: D (to (6,4))\n\nThen for later turns, I can choose arbitrary, but since no food, I should avoid walls and body.\n\nBut to be precise, let's define.\n\nAfter turn 15, at (6,4) after eating, positions: head (6,4), body (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nOn turn 16, move to (5,4) or (6,3).\n\n(5,4) is at x=5,y=4, which is not occupied, so can move there.\n\nSimilarly (6,3).\n\nSay I move L to (5,4).\n\nThen on turn 17, from (5,4), as above, move to (4,4) or (5,3).\n\n(4,4) might be free.\n\nSimilarly, I can continue.\n\nBut for the answer, since the food is eaten, and no other, I can stop after a few moves, but I think I need to provide a sequence for 5 turns or so.\n\nThe thinking is 5+ turns ahead, but output can be for multiple turns.\n\nSince the immediate goal is achieved, I can just provide up to turn 15 or 16.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nAnother thing: in the initial state, the snake positions: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)] which forms a sort of loop, but after moving, it might straighten.\n\nWith the moves I have, it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if moving right causes a trap later, but with the grid, I can go down or left after.\n\nFor example, after eating both foods, I can head towards the left where there is space.\n\nx from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, obstacle at (4,6), but I am at bottom now.\n\nSo I think moving right on turn 12 is optimal.\n\nTherefore, for turn 12: R\n\nThen turn 13: from (4,5), move R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 14: R to (6,5) eat\n\nTurn 15: D to (6,4) eat\n\nNow for turn 16: from (6,4), after eating, head at (6,4), body (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nNow move, say, L to (5,4)\n\nThen turn 17: from (5,4), move to (4,4) or (5,3)\n\nSay move L to (4,4) if possible.\n\n(4,4) should be free.\n\nThen turn 18: from (4,4), move to (3,4) or (4,3), etc.\n\nBut I think for the answer, I can provide up to turn 16 or 17.\n\nSince the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", and t1=12, so up to turn 17 or more.\n\nBut output format is to list actions starting from turn 12.\n\nI think I should provide a sequence.\n\nTo be safe, let's write from turn 12 to turn 16, for 5 moves.\n\nBut turn 12 to 16 is 5 turns: 12,13,14,15,16.\n\nturns: 12,13,14,15,16 — that's 5 actions.\n\nYes.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 12: R\n\nTurn 13: R\n\nTurn 14: R\n\nTurn 15: D\n\nTurn 16: L (to (5,4))\n\nBut on turn 16, moving to (5,4) from (6,4), direction would be left, so for future, but since no immediate constraint, it should be fine.\n\nI could move down to (6,3) on turn 16, but left seems fine.\n\nNow, about the tail reward danger: in this sequence, I don't think it applies, since no food under tail when head adjacent.\n\nFor example, at turn 14, when I eat (6,5), tail is at (2,5), far away.\n\nSimilarly, other times.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nTherefore, the action sequence.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, the strategy prioritizes eating the positive food at (6,5) first due to its short remaining life span (3 turns at turn 12, disappearing after turn 14). This food must be eaten by turn 14 to avoid missing the opportunity. The second food at (6,4) has a longer life span (8 turns), so it can be eaten later. After consuming both foods, the snake should move to open areas to avoid collisions and prepare for potential future food.\n\n### Analysis and Plan\n- **Current State (Turn 12)**:\n  - Snake head at (3,5) with direction R.\n  - Snake body: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)].\n  - Food: (6,5) with life span 3 (eaten by turn 14), (6,4) with life span 8.\n  - Walls: Borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7; internal obstacle at (4,6).\n  - Playable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (4,6).\n\n- **Key Risks and Constraints**:\n  - No instant reverse: Current direction is R, so cannot move L on turn 12.\n  - (6,5) must be eaten by turn 14. Direct path: (3,5) → (4,5) on turn 12, (5,5) on turn 13, (6,5) on turn 14.\n  - After eating (6,5) at turn 14, the snake grows to length 5. From (6,5), moving L to (5,5) is impossible (body collision), so move D to (6,4) to eat the second food on turn 15.\n  - After eating (6,4) at turn 15, the snake grows to length 6. Then, move away from the wall to open space (e.g., left or down) to avoid trapping.\n  - Tail reward danger: Not applicable here, as no food is under the tail when the head is adjacent.\n\n- **5-Turn Plan (Turns 12-16)**:\n  - **Turn 12**: Move R to (4,5) – begins path to (6,5).\n  - **Turn 13**: Move R to (5,5) – continues toward (6,5); from (4,5), U is blocked by wall at (4,6), D is safe but away from food.\n  - **Turn 14**: Move R to (6,5) – eat food, snake length increases to 5.\n  - **Turn 15**: Move D to (6,4) – eat second food, snake length increases to 6.\n  - **Turn 16**: Move L to (5,4) – avoids wall and body, heads to open area for safety.\n\n- **Beyond Turn 16**:\n  - After turn 16, the snake is at (5,4) with positions approximately [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]. From here, prioritize moving to unoccupied cells (e.g., (4,4) or (5,3)) to explore and avoid collisions. Since no more food is specified, survival is key.\n\nThis sequence ensures both foods are eaten quickly, maximizing score (+2) by turn 15. The moves are safe, with no collisions, and the snake is positioned to survive long-term.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 12: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 13: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 14: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 15: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 16: L (left)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 13, and I'm playing Snake. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (4,6). So, I can't move into those cells.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (4,5), then body at (3,5), (2,5), and tail at (2,4). So the snake is 4 segments long. Head direction is right, so it's moving to the east.\n\nFood available:\n\n- At (6,5) with life span 2 and value +1 (since it says \"value1\", and from the rules, positive food is +1, so I assume all these are positive food because it says \"value\" and not negative, but let me check the input: it says \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span\" and lists values as 1, which should be +1 for positive food. Negative food would have -1, but here all are 1, so all positive.)\n\nFood:\n\n- (6,5): life span 2, value +1\n\n- (6,4): life span 7, value +1\n\n- (6,1): life span 10, value +1\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including the current one. So at turn 13, for (6,5), life span is 2, meaning it will disappear after 2 more turns? Let's see: \"life_span\" is given, and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, if life_span is N, it disappears after N turns from now? No.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for a food with life span L at turn t, it will be there until turn t + L - 1? Let's clarify.\n\nSuppose at turn t, life span is L. After turn t, countdown decreases by 1, so after one turn, at turn t+1, life span is L-1. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nSo at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it's gone at turn t + L.\n\nBut \"including current\" might mean that during turn t, it's present, and after the turn, countdown decreases.\n\nI think it's better to think: at the start of turn t, if life span is L, then:\n\n- During turn t, the food is present and can be eaten.\n\n- After the action of turn t, life span decreases to L-1 for turn t+1.\n\n- If L=1, after turn t, it disappears, so not available for turn t+1.\n\nSimilarly, if L=2 at turn t, it will be available for turn t and t+1, but not t+2.\n\nIn this case, at turn 13:\n\n- (6,5): life span 2, so available for turns 13 and 14, disappears after turn 14.\n\n- (6,4): life span 7, available for turns 13 to 19 (since 13+6=19, available until turn 19, disappears after).\n\nTurn t with life span L: available for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, so L turns including current.\n\nFor L=2 at t=13: available for t=13 and t=14.\n\nFor L=7: available for t=13 to t=19 (7 turns: 13,14,15,16,17,18,19).\n\nSimilarly for L=10: t=13 to 22.\n\nNow, snake head at (4,5), moving right. So possible moves: U (up), D (down), L (left), R (right). But current direction is R, so I cannot move left immediately because of no instant reverse. So cannot move L (left).\n\nAlso, walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are borders, so grid from x=0 to x=7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so valid x: 1 to 6? Let's see the coordinates.\n\nSnake positions: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) — so x from 2 to 4, y from 4 to 5. Grid should be from x=1 to x=6? Borders: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so cells with x=0 or x=7 are invalid. Similarly y=0 and y=7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSo valid cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (4,6) is blocked.\n\nx from 1 to 6 inclusive? x=0 wall, x=1 to 6 are free except walls, but borders are walls, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls and cannot be moved to.\n\nFor x, min x=1, max x=6; min y=1, max y=6.\n\nBut y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6.\n\nSimilarly x from 1 to 6.\n\nNow, internal obstacle at (4,6), so (4,6) is also blocked.\n\nNow, food at (6,5), (6,4), (6,1).\n\nAll at x=6, which is the right border, but x=6 is valid since x=7 is wall, so x=6 is the rightmost column, free.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5), (6,4), (6,1) are all on x=6, y=5,4,1.\n\nNow, snake head at (4,5), moving right. So from (4,5), if I move right, I go to (5,5).\n\nPossible moves from (4,5):\n\n- U (up): to (4,6)\n\nBut (4,6) is an internal obstacle? Walls include internal obstacle at (4,6), so (4,6) is blocked, cannot move there.\n\n- D (down): to (4,4)\n\n- L (left): to (3,5), but (3,5) is the body segment, but is it safe? Body collision: if head touches any body segment, it dies. But exception: if it's the tail and tail moves, it might be ok.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, moving to a cell that will be occupied by the tail after the move is ok, because the tail moves.\n\nIn this case, snake positions: head (4,5), then (3,5), (2,5), (2,4). Tail is at (2,4).\n\nIf I move left to (3,5), which is currently occupied by the first body segment.\n\nBut after the move, the snake moves: head to (3,5), then the body segments follow: the segment that was at (3,5) moves to where the head was? No.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo if I move left to (3,5), which is currently occupied by the first body segment.\n\nAfter move:\n\n- New head position: (3,5)\n\n- Then the body: the segment that was at (3,5) moves to the old head position? No.\n\nSequence: positions are list: index 0: head, index 1: neck, etc., up to tail.\n\nWhen head moves to a new cell, say new_pos, then the new body is: new_pos, then the old head position, then the old body positions except the tail is removed if no food eaten, but since we're moving, if we eat food, length increases.\n\nIn this move, if I don't eat food, the tail moves away.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- If head moves to a cell not food, then after move: new head at new position, body segments shift: segment i moves to position of segment i-1 from before, and the tail position is vacated.\n\n- If head moves to food, then snake grows: new head at food, body segments shift, but tail stays, so length increases.\n\nIn terms of collision:\n\nMoving to a cell occupied by a body segment: if that segment is not the tail, it will still be there after the move, so collision.\n\nIf it is the tail, and we don't eat food, the tail moves away, so no collision.\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nBut only if you don't eat food at that cell.\n\nIf you move to the tail cell and it has food, but in this case, tail cell is (2,4), no food there.\n\nBack to possible moves from (4,5):\n\n- U (up): to (4,6) — but (4,6) is internal obstacle, wall, so invalid, collision with wall.\n\n- D (down): to (4,4) — this cell is free? No snake or wall? Let's see: snake positions: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4). So (4,4) is not occupied. Walls: borders and (4,6), so (4,4) should be free. y=4, x=4, min y=1, so yes, (4,4) is free.\n\n- L (left): to (3,5) — currently occupied by body segment. Which segment? Positions: head (4,5), then (3,5) is index 1, the first body segment. After move, if I move to (3,5), new head at (3,5), then body: the segment that was at (3,5) moves to... let's simulate.\n\nBefore move: positions: [ (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) ]\n\nIf head moves to (3,5), which is where the neck is.\n\nAfter move: new head at (3,5), then the next segment: since head moved to (3,5), the segment that was at (3,5) needs to move to the old head position? No.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the body segments follow: the first body segment moves to the old head position, the second to the old first body position, and so on, and the tail moves to the old second last position, vacating the old tail position.\n\nSo, if head moves to a new position P:\n\n- New position 0: P\n\n- New position 1: old position 0 (head)\n\n- New position 2: old position 1\n\n- ...\n\n- New position n: old position n-1\n\nThe old tail position is left.\n\nIn this case, if I move head to (3,5), which is currently old position 1.\n\nAfter move:\n\n- New head: (3,5)\n\n- New position 1: old head (4,5)\n\n- New position 2: old position 1, which was (3,5) but now it's the head, no.\n\nList old positions: index 0: (4,5), index 1: (3,5), index 2: (2,5), index 3: (2,4)\n\nAfter moving head to (3,5):\n\n- New index 0: (3,5)  // new head\n\n- New index 1: old index 0 = (4,5)  // this was head, now neck\n\n- New index 2: old index 1 = (3,5) but (3,5) is now head, conflict.\n\nThe cell (3,5) was occupied by index 1, but now head moves there, so at the same time, it's occupied by both? Collision.\n\nRule: if head moves to a cell occupied by a body segment, it collides unless it's the tail and we don't eat food.\n\nIn this case, (3,5) is occupied by index 1, not the tail. Tail is at (2,4).\n\nSo moving to (3,5) would cause head to be on the same cell as a body segment before movement, and since it's not the tail, after movement, that segment will move to another position, but during the move, it's a collision.\n\nThe rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).\" So if the head moves to a cell that has a body segment, it collides, except if it's the tail segment and no food is eaten there.\n\nHere, (3,5) is not the tail; it's the second segment. So moving left to (3,5) would cause collision with body.\n\nSimilarly, moving right: to (5,5) — is (5,5) free? No snake: snake at (4,5),(3,5),(2,5),(2,4), so (5,5) not occupied. Walls: no wall at (5,5), since x=5 between 1-6, y=5 between 1-6, and not (4,6). So free.\n\nDown: to (4,4), free as above.\n\nUp: to (4,6) is wall, invalid.\n\nSo possible actions: R (right to (5,5)), D (down to (4,4)), or L (left to (3,5)) but L is invalid because collision with body, not tail.\n\nCannot move left because it's reverse? Current direction is R, moving left would be opposite, so no instant reverse, cannot move L anyway.\n\nSo only possible: R or D.\n\nU is wall, L is invalid and reverse.\n\nSo choices: R or D.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritize survival.\n\nFood available: (6,5) with life span 2, so must be eaten by turn 14 or it disappears.\n\n(6,5) is at (6,5), head at (4,5), so distance: from (4,5) to (6,5) is 2 steps right: to (5,5) then (6,5).\n\nBut life span 2: at turn 13, life span 2, so available turn 13 and 14.\n\nIf I move right now to (5,5), then at turn 14, I can move to (6,5) to eat it, if I choose.\n\nBut I have to consider the path.\n\nOther food: (6,4) life span 7, so plenty of time, and (6,1) life span 10, also time.\n\nBut (6,5) is urgent because it disappears soon.\n\nAlso, need to avoid risks.\n\nFirst, let's see the grid layout.\n\nGrid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, with (4,6) blocked.\n\nSo rows y=1 to 6, columns x=1 to 6.\n\nBlocked cells: (4,6), and borders x=0,7 and y=0,7, but those are outside.\n\nNow, snake at: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)\n\nSo the body is at (3,5) and (2,5), tail at (2,4).\n\nIf I move right to (5,5), new positions: head (5,5), then (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) — tail was (2,4), but since no food, tail moves away? After move to (5,5): new head (5,5), then old head (4,5), then old neck (3,5), then old index 2 (2,5), and the tail old index 3 (2,4) is left, but since no food, length same, so positions: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)] — tail at (2,5), and (2,4) free.\n\nNow, from here, I can go to (6,5) to eat the food at turn 14.\n\nBut let's see if that is safe.\n\nFirst, at (6,5), after eating, snake grows: head at (6,5), body: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) — and new tail, so length 5.\n\nBut (6,5) is at x=6, which is the border. Walls at x=7, but x=6 is free, so ok.\n\nNow, after eating at (6,5), I need to move away. Possible moves from (6,5): U to (6,6), D to (6,4), L to (5,5).\n\nBut (5,5) is the neck, so moving left to (5,5) would be body collision? Positions: head at (6,5), neck at (5,5), so (5,5) is body segment, not tail. Tail is at (2,5).\n\nMoving left to (5,5) would collide with body.\n\nCannot move left.\n\nU to (6,6): y=6, is that wall? Borders y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=6 is the top row, free. But (6,6): is it blocked? Internal obstacle is only (4,6), so (6,6) should be free.\n\nD to (6,4): also free.\n\nBut moving U to (6,6) or D to (6,4).\n\n(6,4) has food, but if I move D to (6,4), I eat it immediately? But head at (6,5), move D to (6,4), which has food, so I eat it, grow.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, back to turn 13.\n\nOption 1: Move right to (5,5) at turn 13.\n\nThen turn 14: from (5,5), I can move to (6,5) to eat the food there, since life span 2, available turn 14.\n\nAfter eating, head at (6,5), body: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) — length 5.\n\nNow from (6,5), possible moves: U to (6,6), D to (6,4), but not L to (5,5) because collision.\n\n(6,4) has food, so if I move D to (6,4), I eat it and grow to length 6.\n\nBut is (6,4) safe to eat? Not immediately dangerous, but let's see the position.\n\nAfter moving to (6,5) and eating, head at (6,5), with body behind.\n\nIf I move D to (6,4), new head (6,4), body: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) — tail at (2,5).\n\nNow, from (6,4), I can move to other places.\n\nBut I have to consider the tail reward danger.\n\nRule: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nIn this case, after moving to (6,4), tail is at (2,5), not adjacent to head (6,4), so no issue.\n\nAdjacent means adjacent cells, like up, down, left, right.\n\n(6,4) and (2,5) are not adjacent, far away.\n\nSo safe.\n\nBut from (6,4), I can move to, say, left or down, but down to (6,3) or something.\n\nBut let's not go too far.\n\nAnother option at turn 14 from (5,5): instead of moving to (6,5), I could move up or down, but (5,6) is? y=6, x=5, should be free except (4,6) blocked, so (5,6) free.\n\nMove U to (5,6), but then (6,5) food might disappear if not eaten soon.\n\nBut life span, at turn 14, if not eaten, after turn 14 it disappears? At turn 13, life span 2, so after turn 13, life span decreases to 1 for turn 14. After turn 14, if not eaten, it disappears.\n\nSo if I don't eat at turn 14, it's gone.\n\nSo if I move to (5,5) at turn 13, I should eat at (6,5) at turn 14 to get the food.\n\nOtherwise, it's wasted.\n\nNow, what about moving down at turn 13?\n\nOption: move D to (4,4) at turn 13.\n\nThen positions: head to (4,4), body: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) — and tail (2,4) left, so positions: [(4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]? After move: new head (4,4), new position 1: old head (4,5), new position 2: old index 1 (3,5), new position 3: old index 2 (2,5), and old tail (2,4) free.\n\nSo snake at [(4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nTail at (2,5).\n\nFrom here, at turn 14, I can move to various places.\n\nBut (6,5) is at (6,5), which is two steps right and one up? From (4,4) to (6,5): need to go right to (5,4) or up to (4,5), but (4,5) is now body.\n\nCurrent positions: head (4,4), body (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nSo from (4,4), possible moves:\n\nU to (4,5) — but (4,5) is occupied by body segment (neck). Not tail, tail is (2,5), so collision if move up.\n\nD to (4,3) — free, assuming y=3 valid.\n\nL to (3,4) — free? (3,4) not occupied.\n\nR to (5,4) — free.\n\nAlso, cannot move left? Current direction: after moving down, head direction is D, but for reverse, it depends on previous direction.\n\nRule: \"no instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nAt turn 13, I moved down from (4,5) to (4,4), so direction now D.\n\nFor turn 14, I cannot move up, because up is opposite to down.\n\nSo from (4,4), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (4,5) but occupied by body and also reverse? Cannot move up because it's reverse to current direction D.\n\nCurrent direction after turn 13 move is D, so at turn 14, cannot move U (up), because opposite to D.\n\nCan move D (down), L (left), R (right).\n\nD to (4,3): free\n\nL to (3,4): free\n\nR to (5,4): free\n\nU to (4,5) not possible, collision and reverse forbidden.\n\nNow, if I want to reach (6,5), from (4,4), I need to go right and up, but I cannot go up directly because of body or direction.\n\nFor example, at turn 14, I can move R to (5,4).\n\nThen positions: head to (5,4), body: (4,4), (4,5), (3,5) — tail at (2,5) left, so positions: [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nThen turn 15, from (5,4), I can move U to (5,5), then to (6,5) at turn 16.\n\nBut (6,5) life span: at turn 13, life span 2, so turn 14 is last chance? Turn 13: life span 2, available turn 13 and 14.\n\nTurn 14: if not eaten, after turn 14 it disappears, so not available turn 15.\n\nSo if I don't eat (6,5) by turn 14, it's gone.\n\nBy moving down at turn 13, I cannot reach (6,5) by turn 14 because from (4,4) at turn 14, even if I move right to (5,4), I'm at (5,4), not at (6,5). To reach (6,5) from (5,4), I need to go to (6,4) or (5,5), but (5,5) is not adjacent directly? From (5,4) to (6,5) is diagonal, not adjacent, so must go through (5,5) or (6,4).\n\nAt turn 15, from (5,4) move to (5,5) or (6,4), but (6,5) is not reachable in one step from (5,4). Cells adjacent: up (5,5), down (5,3), left (4,4), right (6,4).\n\n(6,5) is not adjacent to (5,4); it's (x+1,y+1), not horizontal or vertical.\n\nSo from (5,4), I cannot move directly to (6,5); I need to go to (5,5) or (6,4) first.\n\nBut (5,5) might be free or not.\n\nIn the path above, if I move to (5,4) at turn 14, then at turn 15, I can move to (5,5), but (6,5) is gone after turn 14, so I cannot eat it.\n\nTherefore, if I choose to move down at turn 13, I miss the food at (6,5) because I can't reach it by turn 14.\n\nWhereas if I move right at turn 13 to (5,5), I can eat (6,5) at turn 14.\n\nNow, the food at (6,5) is +1, and it's about to disappear, so it's good to eat it.\n\nMoreover, by eating it, I grow, which might be useful.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nOther food: (6,4) and (6,1) are available for many turns.\n\nBut (6,1) is far, y=1.\n\nAlso, after eating (6,5), I'm at (6,5), which is corner, might be risky.\n\nBut I can move down to (6,4) or up to (6,6).\n\n(6,4) has food, so I could eat it immediately at turn 15 if I move down from (6,5).\n\nBut let's plan multiple turns.\n\nFirst, prioritize survival. From (4,5), moving down to (4,4) might be safer in some way? Let's see the grid.\n\nThe snake body occupies (3,5) and (2,5), and tail (2,4), so the area around is not too crowded.\n\nAfter moving down to (4,4), positions: [(4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)], so now (4,5) is body, so from (4,4), I can move down to (4,3), left to (3,4), or right to (5,4).\n\nAll free.\n\nThen I can go towards (6,4) or other food.\n\nBut I miss (6,5).\n\nSince (6,5) is only available for two turns, and I can get it by moving right, it seems better to get it.\n\nMoreover, not getting it means losing a point.\n\nBut survival is key.\n\nNow, another thing: after eating (6,5), I'm at (6,5), and if I move down to (6,4), I eat another food, growing to length 6.\n\nBut then I'm at (6,4), which might be ok.\n\nBut let's see possible dead ends.\n\nThe grid is small, 6x6, with (4,6) blocked.\n\nAvailable spaces: rows 1-6, columns 1-6, minus (4,6).\n\nTotal cells: 36 - 1 = 35, but snake occupies 4, so 31 free, but with food, etc.\n\nAfter growing, more occupied.\n\nBut I need to avoid trapping myself.\n\nFor example, if I go to (6,5) and then to (6,4), I'm at the bottom right, with body behind me.\n\nFrom (6,4), I can move left to (5,4), or down to (6,3), or right? x=6, right is x=7 wall, cannot. Up to (6,5) but that's body, cannot.\n\nSo from (6,4), possible moves: U to (6,5) but occupied by body, collision; D to (6,3); L to (5,4).\n\nSo only D or L.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down, I can continue.\n\nBut let's think 5 turns ahead from turn 13.\n\nTurn 13: action\n\nTurn 14: action\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 18 or so.\n\nFirst, suppose at turn 13, I move R to (5,5).\n\nThen positions: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nTurn 14: move R to (6,5) to eat food.\n\nAfter eating, head at (6,5), grow, so positions: [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)] length 5.\n\nNow, from (6,5), possible moves: U to (6,6), D to (6,4), not L to (5,5) collision.\n\n(6,4) has food, so if I move D to (6,4), I eat it and grow.\n\nTurn 14 action: move to (6,5) and eat, so turn 14 done.\n\nNow turn 15: from (6,5), I can move D to (6,4) to eat that food.\n\nAfter move to (6,4), eat, so new head (6,4), body: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), and grow, so tail adds, positions: [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]? When eat food, head moves to food, and body follows, but tail doesn't move, so length increases by one.\n\nAfter turn 14: positions before turn 15: head (6,5), body (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nIf move D to (6,4) at turn 15: (6,4) is food, so eat, new head (6,4), then body: the previous head position (6,5) becomes new neck, so new positions: [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)] length 6.\n\nNow, from (6,4), possible moves: U to (6,5) but occupied by body, collision; D to (6,3); L to (5,4); R invalid.\n\nSo only D or L.\n\nIf move L to (5,4), or D to (6,3).\n\n(6,3) might be free, or (5,4).\n\nNow, at this point, tail is at (2,5), which is far.\n\nBut I need to think about future moves.\n\nAnother option at turn 15: from (6,5), instead of moving down to (6,4), I could move up to (6,6).\n\n(6,6) should be free.\n\nThen positions: move to (6,6), not food, so no grow, positions: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] tail at (2,5) left, so [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]? After move: new head (6,6), new body: old head (6,5), then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), and tail old (2,5) left, so positions [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] length 5.\n\nThen from (6,6), I can move, but (6,6) is corner, moves: D to (6,5) but body, collision; L to (5,6); U invalid, y=6, up to y=7 wall.\n\nSo only L to (5,6).\n\nThen to (5,6), and so on.\n\nBut I didn't eat (6,4) yet, which has life span 7, so I can eat it later.\n\nBut by moving up, I avoid eating (6,4) immediately, which might be better if I want to save space or something.\n\nBut since I ate (6,5), I have the point.\n\nNow, compare to moving down at turn 13.\n\nIf at turn 13, I move D to (4,4).\n\nPositions: [(4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nTurn 14: from (4,4), cannot move U (reverse and occupied), can move D to (4,3), L to (3,4), R to (5,4).\n\nSuppose I move R to (5,4) to go towards the food.\n\nPositions: head to (5,4), body: (4,4), (4,5), (3,5) — tail (2,5) left, so [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nNow, (6,5) is gone after turn 14, so no.\n\nThen I can go to (6,4) which is at (6,4), life span 7, available.\n\nFrom (5,4), turn 15, I can move R to (6,4) to eat food.\n\n(6,4) is food, so move to (6,4), eat, grow to length 5.\n\nPositions: before move, head (5,4), body (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)\n\nAfter move to (6,4): new head (6,4), body: (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5) and grow, so tail stays, positions [(6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)] length 5.\n\nThen from (6,4), same as before, can move D to (6,3) or L to (5,4) but (5,4) is now body, collision, so only D to (6,3).\n\nSimilar to previous path.\n\nBut in this case, I missed (6,5) food, so I have one less point.\n\nWhereas by moving right first, I get both (6,5) and can get (6,4) if I want.\n\nMoreover, in the first path, after eating (6,5) at turn 14, at turn 15 I can choose to eat (6,4) or not.\n\nIf I don't eat (6,4) immediately, I can go to (6,6) and then left, but (6,4) has life span 7, so I can eat it later.\n\nBut the point is to maximize score, so eating available food is good, as long as not risky.\n\nNow, another food at (6,1), which is far south.\n\nBut I need to think about long-term survival.\n\nThe grid has limited space, and with internal obstacle, it might be tricky.\n\nFor example, the top row y=6, with (4,6) blocked, so cells (1,6) to (6,6) except (4,6) missing.\n\nSimilarly, bottom.\n\nBut with snake growing, I need to have a path to move without hitting body or walls.\n\nSince I have to think 5+ turns ahead, let's plan a sequence.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills.\n\nBut in current state, no food under tail, so ok.\n\nNow, back to turn 13 decision.\n\nMoving right seems better to get the urgent food.\n\nMoreover, moving down might lead to a trap or something.\n\nFor example, if I move down to (4,4), and then I have body at (4,5), so I cannot go up easily.\n\nBut I can go down or left/right.\n\nBut missing the food is a loss.\n\nPerhaps I should get (6,5) since it's easy and about to expire.\n\nThen after that, I can decide.\n\nBut let's see the answer format: I need to output actions for multiple turns, starting from turn 13.\n\nIt says: \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nCurrent turn t1=13, so I need to output actions for turn 13, 14, 15, ... probably for several turns.\n\nBut I don't have to specify all, but at least 5 actions? \"5+ turns ahead\" means plan for 5 future turns, so actions for t=13 to t=17 or so.\n\nOutput format: Turn 13: action, Turn 14: action, etc.\n\nIn the box.\n\nSo I need to commit to a sequence.\n\nSince the future depends on choices, I need to choose a path.\n\nI think moving right at turn 13 is better.\n\nThen at turn 14, move right to (6,5) to eat.\n\nThen at turn 15, I need to choose.\n\nFrom (6,5), I can move up to (6,6) or down to (6,4).\n\nIf I move down to (6,4), I eat the food there immediately, growing to length 6.\n\nThen from (6,4), I can only move down to (6,3) or left to (5,4).\n\nMoving to (6,3) might be ok, or to (5,4).\n\nBut if I move to (6,4) at turn 15, positions as before.\n\nThen turn 16, from (6,4), move to (6,3) or (5,4).\n\nSay move to (5,4).\n\nThen positions: head to (5,4), not food, so no grow, positions: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]? After move from (6,4) to (5,4): new head (5,4), body: old head (6,4), then (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), tail old (2,5) left? Before move: positions [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] for turn 15 after eating (6,4), but length 5? Earlier: after turn 15 eat (6,4), positions [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] and tail at (2,5) is gone? No.\n\nAfter eating at turn 15: head (6,4), body (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) — that's 5 segments, but originally after turn 14 it was length 5, eating adds one, so length 6: positions should include all.\n\nAfter turn 14: head (6,5), body (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) — length 5.\n\nTurn 15 move to (6,4) and eat: new head (6,4), then body: the previous head position (6,5) becomes new position 1, (5,5) position 2, (4,5) position 3, (3,5) position 4, (2,5) position 5, and since ate, add new segment at old tail? No, when eat, the tail doesn't move, so positions: new head at (6,4), new position 1: old head (6,5), new position 2: old position 1 (5,5), new position 3: old position 2 (4,5), new position 4: old position 3 (3,5), new position 5: old position 4 (2,5), and the snake grows, so the tail stays, meaning position 5 is (2,5), and no new position, but length increases.\n\nStandard: when eat, head moves to food, body follows, but tail remains in place, so the new tail is the old tail position.\n\nBefore move: positions: [A, B, C, D, E] with A head, E tail.\n\nMove to food cell F, eat: new positions [F, A, B, C, D, E] or [F, A, B, C, D] and E stays? [F, A, B, C, D] and E is still there? No.\n\nAfter move and eat: the new head is F, then the first body segment is the old head position, then the rest, and the tail is the old tail, but since it grows, the old tail position is still occupied, and the new segment is added.\n\nSo positions: new index 0: F, new index 1: old index 0 (A), new index 2: old index 1 (B), ..., new index n: old index n-1, and new index n+1: old index n (tail).\n\nSo length increases by one.\n\nIn this case, before turn 15 move: positions [ (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) ] head (6,5), tail (2,5)\n\nMove to (6,4) and eat: new head (6,4), new position 1: old head (6,5), new position 2: old position 1 (5,5), new position 3: old position 2 (4,5), new position 4: old position 3 (3,5), new position 5: old position 4 (2,5)\n\nSo positions: [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)] length 6.\n\nTail at (2,5).\n\nNow at turn 16, from (6,4), move to (6,3) or (5,4).\n\nSay move to (5,4): (5,4) not food, so no eat, move to (5,4), new head (5,4), body: (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) — tail (2,5) left, so positions [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]? New head (5,4), new position 1: old head (6,4), new position 2: old position 1 (6,5), new position 3: old position 2 (5,5), new position 4: old position 3 (4,5), new position 5: old position 4 (3,5), and old tail (2,5) free, so positions [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] length 6, tail at (3,5).\n\nThen from (5,4), I can move to other places.\n\nBut the point is, by eating both foods, I have more score.\n\nIf at turn 15 from (6,5) I move up to (6,6), then positions: move to (6,6), not food, so positions [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] tail (2,5) left.\n\nThen from (6,6), move to (5,6), etc., and (6,4) food is still there for later.\n\nBut since (6,4) has long life, I can eat it when convenient.\n\nBut to maximize score, eating it soon is fine, as long as not risky.\n\nIn this case, moving to (6,4) might be ok.\n\nBut at (6,4), I'm at the border.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (6,1) is at y=1, which is bottom row.\n\nI might need to go down later.\n\nBut for now, let's define a sequence.\n\nAlso, I need to consider if there are risks with the body.\n\nFor example, in the first few turns, it seems safe.\n\nWhat about the internal obstacle at (4,6)? It might block some paths.\n\nFor instance, from (6,6), I can only move left to (5,6), then from (5,6), I can move down to (5,5) or left to (4,6), but (4,6) is blocked, so cannot.\n\n(5,6) moves: D to (5,5), L to (4,6) invalid, R to (6,6) body, U invalid, so only D to (5,5).\n\nBut (5,5) might be occupied later.\n\nBut it's manageable.\n\nNow, back to turn 13.\n\nI think moving right is better to get the food.\n\nSo for turn 13: R\n\nThen turn 14: R to eat (6,5)\n\nThen at turn 15, I can choose to move D to (6,4) to eat that food as well.\n\nSince it's available, and I can eat it, why not? +1 score.\n\nThen after that, I need to move away.\n\nTurn 15: move D to (6,4) eat.\n\nThen turn 16: from (6,4), I can move D to (6,3) or L to (5,4).\n\n(6,3) might be free, or (5,4).\n\nTo go towards the other food at (6,1), moving down is good.\n\n(6,1) is at y=1, so from (6,4) to (6,3), then to (6,2), then to (6,1) to eat.\n\nBut (6,1) has life span 10, so plenty of time.\n\nI could explore other areas.\n\nBut let's plan 5 turns: turn 13 to 17.\n\nTurn 13: move R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 14: move R to (6,5) eat\n\nTurn 15: move D to (6,4) eat\n\nNow after turn 15, positions: head (6,4), body (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nTurn 16: from (6,4), move to (6,3) or (5,4)\n\nIf I move to (6,3), not food, so positions: new head (6,3), body: (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) — tail (2,5) left, so positions [(6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nTail at (3,5).\n\nThen turn 17, from (6,3), move to (6,2) or (5,3), etc.\n\nSimilarly, if move to (5,4) at turn 16.\n\nBut moving down to (6,3) is fine.\n\nNow, is there any immediate danger? At (6,4) after eating, the body is behind, and I can move down.\n\nTail is at (2,5), not adjacent.\n\nAnother consideration: the snake is getting long, and in a small grid, I need to avoid boxing myself.\n\nFor example, the top row is partially blocked.\n\nBut I can move down to the bottom.\n\nFood at (6,1) is there.\n\nI could also go left.\n\nBut for now, the sequence seems ok.\n\nIf at turn 15 I move up to (6,6) instead, then I don't eat (6,4) immediately, but I can eat it later.\n\nBut since I can eat it now, I might as well for the score.\n\nMoreover, not eating it doesn't give advantage, I think.\n\nSo I'll go with eating it.\n\nNow, for turn 16, I need to move from (6,4).\n\nMoving to (6,3) or (5,4).\n\n(6,3) is down, towards (6,1).\n\n(5,4) is left, to the center.\n\nSince (6,1) is a food, I can go down.\n\nBut life span 10, so no rush.\n\nTo keep options open, moving left to (5,4) might be better to avoid the border.\n\nFor example, move to (5,4) at turn 16.\n\nThen positions: head to (5,4), not food, positions [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] as before.\n\nThen from (5,4), I can move U to (5,5), but (5,5) is body? Positions: (5,4) head, then (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), so (5,5) is position 3, body segment.\n\nSo cannot move to (5,5), collision.\n\nD to (5,3), L to (4,4), R to (6,4) but (6,4) is body, collision.\n\nSo possible: D to (5,3), L to (4,4), or U? U to (5,5) collision, so only D or L.\n\nCurrent direction: after moving to (5,4), direction from (6,4) to (5,4) is left, so direction L.\n\nThen at turn 17, cannot move right, opposite.\n\nBut from above, only D or L possible.\n\nSay move L to (4,4) at turn 17.\n\nThen to (4,4), and so on.\n\nBut it might get messy.\n\nIf at turn 16 from (6,4) I move down to (6,3), then positions: [(6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nThen from (6,3), can move D to (6,2), L to (5,3), or U to (6,4) collision.\n\nSo D or L.\n\nThen I can go to (6,2), (6,1) to eat.\n\nBut (6,1) has food, so I can eat it at some point.\n\nFor the sequence, I think for the first few turns, moving to eat the foods is fine.\n\nSince the problem asks to think 5+ turns ahead, I'll output a sequence for 5 turns.\n\nSo turns 13 to 17.\n\nTurn 13: move R\n\nTurn 14: move R to eat (6,5)\n\nTurn 15: move D to eat (6,4)\n\nThen turn 16: from (6,4), I need to move, say to (6,3) to go down.\n\nTurn 17: from (6,3), move to (6,2) or (5,3), but I don't have to specify beyond, but for the output, I need to put actions.\n\nSince the state changes, I might need to plan based on that.\n\nBut in the answer, I can put a sequence assuming no surprises.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n\nTo be safe, at turn 15, after eating (6,5), I could move up to (6,6) to avoid eating (6,4) immediately and not be stuck at bottom.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 13: R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 14: R to (6,5) eat\n\nTurn 15: U to (6,6)  // not eating (6,4) yet\n\nPositions: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nThen turn 16: from (6,6), only possible move L to (5,6)\n\nMove to (5,6), not food, positions: [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)] tail (3,5) left? After move: new head (5,6), body: (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), and old tail (3,5) free, so positions [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)] length 5.\n\nThen from (5,6), can move D to (5,5) but (5,5) is body, collision; L to (4,6) invalid; R to (6,6) body; U invalid. So only D to (5,5) but occupied, cannot.\n\n(5,5) is position 4 in the list, body segment.\n\nMoves from (5,6): adjacent cells: (5,5) down, (4,6) left, (5,7) up invalid, (6,6) right.\n\n(5,5) is down, but occupied by body; (4,6) is wall; (6,6) is occupied by body (position 1); so all adjacent cells are invalid or occupied, so no possible move, death.\n\nOh! Problem.\n\nAt (5,6), after moving from (6,6), and the body is at (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), etc.\n\nSpecifically, (5,5) is directly below (5,6), and it's occupied, so cannot move down.\n\nLeft to (4,6) wall, right to (6,6) occupied, up invalid.\n\nSo trapped, die.\n\nTherefore, moving to (6,6) at turn 15 is dangerous because it leads to a dead end.\n\nI must not go to (6,6) in this situation.\n\nTherefore, from (6,5) at turn 15, I should move down to (6,4) instead, which is safe, as I can then move down or left.\n\nSo the better choice is to move down to (6,4) at turn 15.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 13: R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 14: R to (6,5) eat\n\nTurn 15: D to (6,4) eat\n\nNow turn 16: from (6,4), I can move to (6,3) or (5,4)\n\nBoth seem possible.\n\nMoving to (6,3) is down, towards (6,1) food.\n\nMoving to (5,4) is left, to center.\n\nSince (6,1) has long life, I can go to (5,4) to have more space.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nAt turn 16, move to (5,4).\n\nThen positions: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] as before.\n\nThen turn 17, from (5,4), can move D to (5,3), L to (4,4), or U to (5,5) but occupied, collision, so D or L.\n\nSay move L to (4,4).\n\nThen to (4,4), and so on.\n\nBut I need to output for several turns.\n\nSince the food at (6,1) is there, I might want to eat it eventually.\n\nBut for the sequence, I'll put:\n\nTurn 13: R\n\nTurn 14: R\n\nTurn 15: D\n\nThen for turn 16, say move to (5,4), so L\n\nThen turn 17, from (5,4), move to (4,4), so L again.\n\nBut (4,4) might be free.\n\nIn positions, after turn 16: head (5,4), body (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)\n\n(4,4) is not occupied, so move L to (4,4) at turn 17.\n\nThen positions: new head (4,4), body (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) — tail (3,5) left, so positions [(4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)]? New head (4,4), new position 1: old head (5,4), new position 2: old position 1 (6,4), new position 3: old position 2 (6,5), new position 4: old position 3 (5,5), new position 5: old position 4 (4,5), old tail (3,5) free.\n\nSo positions: [(4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)] but (4,5) is position 5, and (4,4) is head, so (4,5) is above.\n\nBut no immediate issue.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut I think for the output, I'll provide actions for turn 13 to 17.\n\nAnd since I moved to eat the foods, I have +2 score so far.\n\nIf I had moved down initially, I only get one food later.\n\nSo better.\n\nNow, to confirm, at turn 13, moving right is safe and beneficial.\n\nSo final sequence:\n\nTurn 13: R\n\nTurn 14: R\n\nTurn 15: D\n\nThen for turn 16, I need to choose. Since at (6,4), moving L to (5,4) is fine.\n\nThen turn 17, from (5,4), moving L to (4,4) or D to (5,3), but I'll put L to (4,4) for example.\n\nBut it's arbitrary.\n\nTo go towards the center.\n\nSince the output should be for the turns, I'll put:\n\nTurn 13: R\n\nTurn 14: R\n\nTurn 15: D\n\nTurn 16: L  // to (5,4)\n\nTurn 17: L  // to (4,4), assuming I move left\n\nBut from (5,4), moving to (4,4) is left.\n\nDirection: from (6,4) to (5,4) is left, so at turn 16, direction L.\n\nThen at turn 17, cannot move right, but moving left to (4,4) is ok.\n\nThen from (4,4), I can move down, left, etc.\n\nBut I think it's fine.\n\nI think for the purpose, I'll go with this.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, the AI must prioritize eating the positive food at (6,5) due to its low remaining life span (2 turns, disappearing after turn 14). Moving right immediately (turn 13) allows the snake to reach and eat this food on turn 14. After eating, moving down (turn 15) consumes the food at (6,4), adding another point. Subsequent moves focus on avoiding the border and body collisions while positioning for future food opportunities, such as (6,1), which has a long life span (10 turns). The sequence below is safe for at least 5 turns, with no collisions or dead ends, and scores +2.\n\n- **Turn 13**: Move right (R) to (5,5). This positions the head closer to (6,5) and avoids the down move, which would miss the urgent food.\n- **Turn 14**: Move right (R) to (6,5), eating the food (+1 score, snake length now 5). This must be done now as the food disappears after this turn.\n- **Turn 15**: Move down (D) to (6,4), eating the food there (+1 score, snake length now 6). Moving up to (6,6) is avoided as it leads to a dead end on turn 16 (only move left to (5,6), then trapped with no safe moves).\n- **Turn 16**: Move left (L) to (5,4). This moves away from the border and avoids potential traps, keeping the snake centered for flexibility. Moving down to (6,3) is also safe but less flexible for accessing other areas.\n- **Turn 17**: Move left (L) to (4,4). This continues toward open space, avoiding the body segment at (4,5). From here, future moves can target (6,1) or explore safely.\n\nThis sequence eats two foods immediately, adding +2 to the score, and ensures the snake survives beyond turn 17 with options for further scoring. Key risks avoided:\n- No body or wall collisions: Moves are to free cells, and the tail moves away when relevant.\n- No instant reverse: Direction changes (e.g., right to down on turn 15) are perpendicular, not opposite.\n- Tail reward danger: Not applicable, as no food is under the tail, and the head is never adjacent to the tail with food.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: R (right)  \nTurn 14: R (right)  \nTurn 15: D (down)  \nTurn 16: L (left)  \nTurn 17: L (left)  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with an internal obstacle at (4,6). Walls are at the borders, so cells like (0,y) or (x,0) are out of bounds, and (4,6) is an obstacle, so I can't move there.\n\nSnake positions: head at (5,5), then (4,5), (3,5), (2,5). So the snake is horizontal, facing right, from (2,5) to (5,5). Head direction is R, so currently moving right.\n\nFood:\n\n- (6,5) with value 1, life_span 1. So it disappears after this turn if not eaten. Since current turn is t=14, it will be gone by t=15 if not eaten now.\n\n- (6,4) with value 1, life_span 6. So it has 6 turns left, meaning it disappears at t=20.\n\n- (6,1) with value 1, life_span 9. Disappears at t=23.\n\nAll food has value +1, so positive food. No negative food here.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nCurrent head position: (5,5), moving right. Possible moves: U, D, L, R. But I can't move left because that would be opposite to current direction (R), and no instant reverse. Current direction is R, so I can't move L on the next turn. So possible actions: U, D, R. L is invalid.\n\nNow, food at (6,5) is directly in front, one step right. But life_span is 1, meaning if I don't eat it this turn, it disappears. If I move right to (6,5), I eat it.\n\nBut I need to consider the risks. Also, there's a rule about tail reward danger. Let's see.\n\nIf I eat (6,5), snake grows, so new positions would be: head at (6,5), then the body: after eating, the tail doesn't move, so snake becomes [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)] but since I ate food, length increases, so it should be [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)] and the tail is at (2,5). Normally, when you eat, the tail stays put for that turn, so the new segment is added at the head position after moving, but since the head moves to the food, it eats and grows.\n\nStandard Snake: when head moves to a cell with food, it eats it, and the tail doesn't move that turn, so length increases by one. So after moving to (6,5), the snake becomes: head at (6,5), then previous head (5,5) becomes body, and so on, with the tail still at (2,5), but since we added a segment, the tail is now (2,5) for one more turn? Let's clarify.\n\nInitial positions: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)] with head (5,5).\n\nIf I move right to (6,5), which has food, I eat it. So after move:\n\n- Head moves to (6,5)\n\n- Body segments: the previous head (5,5) becomes the first body segment, then (4,5), (3,5), and the tail (2,5) remains, but since I ate, I add a new segment, so the tail doesn't move. So new positions: [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)] — length 5 now, tail at (2,5).\n\nBut (2,5) was already the tail, so it stays, and the new segment is effectively added, but the tail position doesn't change immediately; it will move next turn.\n\nNow, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nHere, after eating (6,5), the tail is at (2,5), which is not adjacent to head (6,5). Head at (6,5), tail at (2,5), distance is 4 cells away, not adjacent. So no issue.\n\nBut is there food under the tail? The food is at (6,5), which we're eating, not at tail. Tail is at (2,5), no food mentioned there, so no problem.\n\nNow, other food: (6,4) and (6,1).\n\n(6,4) is below (6,5), and (6,1) further down.\n\nAfter moving to (6,5), head is at (6,5), and I can move U, D, L, R? But (6,5) is at the right border? Walls at x=7, so x=6 is within bounds, since x=0 and x=7 are walls, so playable x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=6 is the last column, y=6 is last row? y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 to 6.\n\nIn this case, (6,5) is on the right edge.\n\nFrom (6,5), possible moves: U to (6,6), D to (6,4), L to (5,5). R would be to (7,5) which is wall, invalid. So U, D, L.\n\nNow, if I eat (6,5) this turn, I get +1 score, and length increases.\n\nBut life_span is 1, so if I don't eat it now, it disappears, and I miss it.\n\nThere's also (6,4) with life_span 6, so I can eat it later.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nAlternative: if I don't eat (6,5), what can I do? I can move U or D or R, but R to (6,5) eats it, or I can avoid.\n\nIf I move U to (5,6), or D to (5,4), or R to (6,5) to eat.\n\nBut if I don't eat (6,5), it disappears, so I lose that food.\n\nBut perhaps it's risky to go right because I might get stuck.\n\nLet me map the grid.\n\nGrid: 7x7, walls at borders, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6).\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), so I can't go to (4,6).\n\nSnake: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) — all on row y=5, x from 2 to 5.\n\nFood:\n\n- (6,5): value 1, life 1 — must eat now or lose\n\n- (6,4): value 1, life 6 — can eat later\n\n- (6,1): value 1, life 9 — can eat much later\n\nNow, head at (5,5), direction R, so can move U, D, R. L invalid.\n\nOption 1: Move R to (6,5) — eat food, get +1, snake grows to length 5, head at (6,5).\n\nThen from there, I can go U to (6,6), D to (6,4), or L to (5,5).\n\n(6,4) has food, so if I go D, I can eat (6,4) next turn.\n\nBut after eating (6,5), head at (6,5), and (6,4) is below, so D to (6,4) would eat it if I move there.\n\nBut (6,4) has life_span 6, so it will be there for several turns.\n\nAfter eating (6,5), snake is at [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nIf I move D to (6,4), I eat (6,4), so snake grows to length 6: head at (6,4), then (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nBut now head is at (6,4), which is bottom-right corner almost. From (6,4), possible moves: U to (6,5), but (6,5) is occupied by body? Positions: (6,5) is body, so I can't go U to (6,5) because it's occupied.\n\nAfter moving to (6,4), the body is at (6,5), which is directly above, so U to (6,5) is invalid, collision.\n\nSimilarly, R to (7,4) wall, invalid.\n\nD to (6,3) possible, L to (5,4) possible.\n\nBut (6,5) is body, so U is blocked.\n\nSo from (6,4), only D or L.\n\nIf I go D, to (6,3), then I can go down, but there's food at (6,1), but it's far.\n\nBut I have to avoid walls and body.\n\nAfter two eats, I'm at (6,4) with body behind me, and I can only go left or down.\n\nIf I go left, to (5,4), then I have more options.\n\nBut let's think long-term.\n\nThe grid has an obstacle at (4,6), which might block some paths.\n\nAlso, the snake body is on row 5, columns 2-5.\n\nNow, if I don't eat (6,5) this turn, it disappears, and I can go elsewhere.\n\nFor example, if I move U to (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is row 6, column 5.\n\nIs (5,6) free? Snake is at (5,5), (4,5), etc., not at (5,6). Food not there. Obstacle at (4,6), not (5,6). Walls are borders, so (5,6) should be free.\n\ny=6 is the top row? y=0 bottom, y=7 top wall, so y=6 is the highest row, x=1 to 6.\n\n(5,6) is free.\n\nIf I move U to (5,6), head now at (5,6).\n\nDirection was R, now moving U, so new direction U.\n\nFrom (5,6), possible moves: U to (5,7) but y=7 wall, invalid; D to (5,5), but (5,5) is now body? Let's see positions.\n\nAfter moving U: head to (5,6), body: previous head (5,5) becomes body, then (4,5), (3,5), (2,5). So positions: [(5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\n(5,5) is directly below, so if I go D, to (5,5), it's body, collision, invalid.\n\nL to (4,6), but (4,6) is obstacle, wall, invalid.\n\nR to (6,6), which should be free? (6,6) not occupied, no food, so possible.\n\nSo from (5,6), only possible move is R to (6,6), since U, D, L all invalid.\n\nThen from (6,6), I can go D to (6,5) or L to (5,6), but (5,6) is body, so L invalid; U to (6,7) wall invalid; so only D to (6,5).\n\n(6,5) had food, but if I didn't eat it this turn, it disappears, so by turn 15, it's gone.\n\nCurrent turn t=14, if I don't eat (6,5) now, it disappears after this turn, so at t=15, it's not there.\n\nIn the sequence: if I move U to (5,6) at t=14, then at t=15, from (5,6) I can only move R to (6,6), then at t=16, from (6,6) only move D to (6,5), but at t=16, (6,5) food is long gone, since it disappeared at t=15.\n\nAnd (6,5) is empty now.\n\nSo I go to (6,5) at t=16, no food.\n\nBut I have other food.\n\nFrom (6,5), I can go D to (6,4) which has food with life 6, so at t=16, it should still be there if life_span 6 from t=14.\n\nLife_span: at turn t, food has life_span N, it decreases each turn, including current, so if not eaten, it disappears after N turns.\n\nFood at (6,5): life_span 1 at t=14, so if not eaten on t=14, it disappears at the end of t=14, so not available on t=15.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) life_span 6 at t=14, so it will disappear after t=19, available from t=14 to t=19 inclusive? Let's clarify.\n\nLife_span N: present for N turns, including the current turn. Countdown decreases every turn, so at turn t, if life_span is S, it will be there for S more turns, disappearing after S turns.\n\nFor (6,5): at t=14, life_span=1, so it will disappear after this turn, meaning not available on t=15.\n\nFor (6,4): life_span=6 at t=14, so it will be available until t=19, disappearing after t=19, so last chance to eat on t=19.\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) life_span=9, available until t=22.\n\nBack to options.\n\nIf I move U at t=14, to (5,6), then as above, I'm forced to R to (6,6) at t=15, then D to (6,5) at t=16, which is empty, then from (6,5), I can go D to (6,4) to eat the food there, or L to (5,5), etc.\n\nAt t=16, head at (6,5), body: let's track positions.\n\nAt t=14: move U to (5,6), positions: [(5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nAt t=15: move R to (6,6), positions: head to (6,6), then body (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) — tail (2,5) moves off? When moving, the tail moves forward unless eating.\n\nSince no food eaten, at t=15, move to (6,6), head at (6,6), then body segments: previous head (5,6) becomes body, then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), and tail (2,5) is removed? Standard: when no eat, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so tail moves off.\n\nInitial positions at start t=14: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nAfter move at t=14: to (5,6), so new head (5,6), then body: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), and tail (2,5) moves? When head moves to new cell, the body follows: the segment that was at (5,5) moves to where head was, but head is moving to (5,6), so the first body segment moves to (5,5), which is now empty? Let's think.\n\nPositions before move: head (5,5), body (4,5), (3,5), tail (2,5).\n\nAfter moving head to (5,6): new head (5,6). The body segment that was at (4,5) moves to the previous head position (5,5)? No.\n\nIn Snake, when the head moves, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So the segment behind the head moves to where the head was, and so on.\n\nSo after moving head to (5,6):\n\n- Head: (5,6)\n\n- The first body segment (which was at (4,5)) moves to where the head was, (5,5)\n\n- The second body segment (which was at (3,5)) moves to where the first body was, (4,5)\n\n- The tail (which was at (2,5)) moves to where the second body was, (3,5)\n\nSo new positions: [(5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] — length 4, tail at (3,5).\n\n(2,5) is no longer part of snake.\n\nSimilarly, at t=15, move to (6,6): head to (6,6), then body: (5,6) moves to where head was? Head was (5,6), so the first body segment moves to (5,6), but (5,6) is now the new position? Confusion.\n\nPositions before t=15 move: [(5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nHead at (5,6).\n\nMove to (6,6): new head (6,6).\n\nThen, the first body segment (at (5,5)) moves to the previous head position (5,6)? But (5,6) is now the new head position? No.\n\nThe previous head position is (5,6), but after head moves, the first body segment moves to the cell where the head was before moving.\n\nBefore moving, head is at (5,6). After moving head to (6,6), the cell (5,6) is now free for the body to move into.\n\nSo:\n\n- New head: (6,6)\n\n- First body segment (was at (5,5)) moves to (5,6) — previous head position\n\n- Second body segment (was at (4,5)) moves to (5,5) — where the first body was\n\n- Tail (was at (3,5)) moves to (4,5) — where the second body was\n\nSo new positions: [(6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5)] and (3,5) is gone.\n\nTail at (4,5).\n\nThen at t=16, from (6,6), move D to (6,5): new head (6,5), then body: first body at (5,6) moves to (6,6), second body at (5,5) moves to (5,6), tail at (4,5) moves to (5,5).\n\nPositions: [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5)]\n\n(4,5) gone.\n\nNow, (6,5) is empty, no food.\n\nFrom here, I can go D to (6,4) which has food, or L to (5,5) but (5,5) is body, collision, or U to (6,7) wall, invalid. So only D to (6,4).\n\nThen eat (6,4) at t=16 or later, but life_span allows.\n\nBut this path seems inefficient and I missed the (6,5) food.\n\nIf I move D at t=14 instead.\n\nFrom (5,5), move D to (5,4).\n\n(5,4) is free? No snake there, no food mentioned, so yes.\n\nThen positions: head to (5,4), body: (5,5) moves to? Previous head (5,5), so first body (4,5) moves to (5,5), then (3,5) to (4,5), tail (2,5) to (3,5). New positions: [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nTail at (3,5).\n\nThen from (5,4), I can move to eat (6,4) or other.\n\nBut (6,4) is at (6,4), adjacent right and down? (5,4) to (6,4) is right, which is possible, but current direction after moving D is D, so I can move U, D, L, R? Direction is now D, so can't move U (opposite), so possible: D to (5,3), L to (4,4), R to (6,4).\n\nR to (6,4) eats the food.\n\nBut at t=14, I didn't eat (6,5), so it disappears.\n\nBy moving D at t=14, I can then move R at t=15 to eat (6,4) if I want.\n\nBut let's think about the immediate choice.\n\nPriority is long-term survival and maximizing score.\n\nThe food at (6,5) must be eaten now or lost.\n\nIf I eat it, I get +1, but I might get stuck in the corner.\n\nIf I don't eat it, I lose the food, but have more space.\n\nAlso, there's food at (6,1), which is far, so I need to plan to get there eventually.\n\nMoreover, the obstacle at (4,6) blocks the top-right area.\n\nLet's sketch the grid mentally.\n\nRows y=1 to 6, bottom to top? Usually in coordinates, y=0 bottom, y=6 top, but in this, walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 bottom, y=6 top? Not specified, but since walls at y=0 and y=7, the playable area is y=1 to 6, so y=1 is bottom row, y=6 top row.\n\nSimilarly, x=1 left, x=6 right.\n\nObstacle at (4,6), which is top row, x=4.\n\nSnake at (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) — so on row y=5, which is second from top? y=1 bottom, y=6 top, so y=5 is row 5 from bottom, or index.\n\nLet's number: y=1,2,3,4,5,6 with 1 bottom, 6 top? Doesn't matter for movement, but for visualization.\n\nSince food at (6,1), which is bottom-right, and (6,4) and (6,5) are on right column.\n\n(6,5) is top-right if y=5 is high, but y=6 is top, so (6,5) is below top.\n\ny=6 top, y=1 bottom, so (6,1) bottom-right, (6,6) top-right, (6,5) second from top, (6,4) third from top.\n\nBack to decision.\n\nIf I eat (6,5) at t=14, then I'm at (6,5) with snake longer.\n\nFrom there, I can go D to (6,4) to eat that food soon, or L to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut if I go D to (6,4), I eat it, but then I'm at (6,4) with body at (6,5) above, so I can only go L or D.\n\nIf I go L, to (5,4), then I can explore down or left.\n\nBut there's also the food at (6,1), which I might want to get later.\n\nBut with the snake growing, it might be harder to maneuver in the corner.\n\nIf I don't eat (6,5), I can go to other areas.\n\nFor example, move U to (5,6) as before, but that led to being forced to the corner.\n\nMove D to (5,4) at t=14.\n\nThen at (5,4), I can move R to (6,4) to eat that food at t=15, or move down or left.\n\n(6,4) has life 6, so I can eat it later, no rush.\n\nBut if I eat it, I grow, and I might be near the corner.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid eating immediately and plan a path to get multiple food.\n\nBut (6,5) must be eaten now or never.\n\nAnother idea: since the snake is on row 5, I can move down to row 4 or up to row 6.\n\nRow 6 has obstacle at (4,6), so not all cells free.\n\nLet's list free cells.\n\nGrid: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\nWalls at borders and (4,6) obstacle.\n\nSnake occupies (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)\n\nFood at (6,5), (6,4), (6,1)\n\nFree cells: for example, (1,1) to (1,6), (2,1) to (2,4) and (2,6), (3,1) to (3,4) and (3,6), (4,1) to (4,5) but (4,5) is snake, (4,6) obstacle, so (4,1) to (4,4), and (4,5) occupied, (4,6) wall.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1) to (5,4), (5,5) occupied, (5,6) free? (5,6) not occupied or food.\n\n(6,1) food, (6,2) free? Not mentioned, so free, (6,3) free, (6,4) food, (6,5) food, (6,6) free.\n\nBut (6,5) food will be gone if not eaten.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should eat all three food if possible, but (6,5) must be eaten now.\n\nSo eating it now might be necessary to not miss it.\n\nBut let's check if it's safe.\n\nAfter eating (6,5) at t=14, head at (6,5), snake: [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)] length 5.\n\nFrom (6,5), I can:\n\n- Move U to (6,6): free, so possible.\n\n- Move D to (6,4): has food, so I can eat it.\n\n- Move L to (5,5): but (5,5) is body, collision, invalid.\n\nL to (5,5) is occupied by body, so I can't move there.\n\nU to (6,6) or D to (6,4).\n\nIf I move U to (6,6), then positions: head to (6,6), body: (6,5) moves to? Previous head (6,5), so first body (5,5) moves to (6,5), then (4,5) to (5,5), (3,5) to (4,5), tail (2,5) to (3,5). New positions: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] tail at (3,5).\n\nFrom (6,6), I can move D to (6,5) but (6,5) is body, collision; L to (5,6), which is free? (5,6) not occupied, so possible; U and R invalid (walls).\n\nSo only L to (5,6).\n\nMove to (5,6) at t=15.\n\nThen from (5,6), I can move U invalid, D to (5,5) but (5,5) is body, collision; L to (4,6) but (4,6) is obstacle, wall; R to (6,6) but (6,6) is previous position, now body? Positions after move to (5,6): head (5,6), body (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) — tail at (4,5)? Let's not digress.\n\nPoint is, from (6,5) after eating, if I go U, I end up in a position where I can only go left to (5,6), but then from there, I might be stuck if not careful, but I can go down later.\n\nBut I have food at (6,4) below.\n\nIf from (6,5) I move D to (6,4) at t=15.\n\nAt t=14 I moved to (6,5) and ate, so at t=15, from (6,5), I move D to (6,4).\n\n(6,4) has food, so I eat it.\n\nNew head (6,4), and since I eat, tail doesn't move, so snake grows: positions [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)] length 6.\n\nHead at (6,4), body at (6,5) above, (5,5) left-up, etc.\n\nFrom (6,4), possible moves: U to (6,5) but body, collision; D to (6,3) possible; L to (5,4) possible; R invalid.\n\nSo only D or L.\n\nIf I go L to (5,4), then I can go down or left.\n\nIf I go D to (6,3), then to (6,2), (6,1) to eat that food later.\n\nBut at (6,1), I can eat it, but after that, I'm at bottom-right with a long snake, and it might be hard to get out.\n\nFor example, from (6,1), after eating, head at (6,1), body behind, I can only go L or U, but U might be blocked if body is there.\n\nBut with careful movement, I can go up column 5 or 4.\n\nBut the space is limited with the snake length.\n\nCurrent snake length is 4, after eating one food, 5, after two, 6, after three, 7.\n\nGrid has 36 cells, but walls and obstacle, so 36-1=35 free cells, but snake occupies cells.\n\nAt start, 4 cells occupied, 3 food, so free cells: 35 - 4 - 3 = 28, but food is on cells, so when eaten, it's removed, but snake grows.\n\nInitially, cells occupied: snake 4, food 3, walls and obstacle not counted as cells.\n\nPlayable cells: 6x6=36 minus 1 obstacle, so 35 cells.\n\nOccupied by snake: 4 cells, so 31 free, but 3 have food, so 28 empty cells.\n\nAfter eating food, snake grows, so less free space.\n\nWith length 7, it might be tight, but possible to survive.\n\nBut I need to prioritize survival.\n\nAnother risk: if I eat (6,5) and then go to (6,4), I'm in the corner with few moves.\n\nIf I eat (6,5) and then go U to (6,6), I can go left to (5,6), then from (5,6), I can go down to (5,5) but (5,5) is body, or I can wait, but at t=15 from (6,6) to (5,6), then at t=16 from (5,6), only possible move is down to (5,5) but it's body, collision, or other moves invalid as before.\n\nFrom (5,6), after moving there, positions: let's say at t=15, head at (5,6), body at (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), etc.\n\n(5,5) is body, so D to (5,5) invalid.\n\nL to (4,6) invalid obstacle.\n\nU invalid.\n\nR to (6,6) invalid, body.\n\nSo no moves, death.\n\nAh, problem.\n\nIf I go to (6,5) at t=14, then U to (6,6) at t=15, then at t=16 from (6,6) to (5,6), then at t=17 from (5,6), no valid moves, I die.\n\nSo that path is fatal.\n\nTherefore, from (6,5), I should not go U; I must go D to (6,4) or something else.\n\nBut from (6,5), only U and D are valid, L is invalid because (5,5) body.\n\nSo only U or D.\n\nIf I go D to (6,4), I can eat the food there, then from (6,4) I can go L or D.\n\nIf I go L to (5,4), then I can move to other areas.\n\nFor example, from (5,4), I can go down to (5,3), left to (4,4), etc.\n\nThen I can head towards (6,1) later.\n\nBut when I go to (6,4) after eating (6,5), I might eat (6,4) immediately or not.\n\nAt t=15, from (6,5), if I move D to (6,4), I eat it since food is there.\n\nSo I grow to length 6 at (6,4).\n\nThen from (6,4), as above, only D or L.\n\nIf I go L to (5,4), then positions: head to (5,4), body: since no eat, tail moves, so head (5,4), first body (6,4) moves to (6,4)? Previous head (6,4), so first body (6,5) moves to (6,4), but (6,4) is new head position? No.\n\nAfter moving from (6,4) to (5,4) at t=16? Let's timeline.\n\nt=14: move R to (6,5), eat food, positions: [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nt=15: move D to (6,4), eat food, so grow: head to (6,4), body: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) and tail doesn't move, so [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)] length 6.\n\nNow at t=16, from (6,4), I can move D to (6,3) or L to (5,4).\n\nIf I move L to (5,4), no food, so move: head to (5,4), then body: first body (6,5) moves to (6,4), second body (5,5) moves to (6,5), then (4,5) to (5,5), (3,5) to (4,5), tail (2,5) to (3,5). New positions: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] tail at (3,5).\n\nFrom (5,4), I can move U to (5,5) but (5,5) is body, collision; D to (5,3) possible; L to (4,4) possible; R to (6,4) but (6,4) is body, collision. So U and R invalid, only D or L.\n\nI can go down or left.\n\nSimilarly, I can continue to (6,1) later.\n\nBut to eat (6,1), I need to go down the right column.\n\nFor example, from (5,4) I can go D to (5,3), then to (5,2), (5,1), then R to (6,1) to eat.\n\nBut at (5,1), I can go R to (6,1) to eat.\n\nBut the snake is long, so I need to make sure the path is clear.\n\nAt (6,1), after eating, I might be stuck, but I can go up or left.\n\nBut let's see the tail position; the tail is moving, so it might free up space.\n\nFor example, when I move, the tail moves, so cells are freed.\n\nIn this case, the tail is at (3,5), and as I move down, it will follow.\n\nBut since I'm going to row 1, it might be ok.\n\nBut to avoid risk, perhaps I should not eat both (6,5) and (6,4) immediately.\n\nAt t=14, I can eat (6,5), then at t=15, instead of going D to (6,4), I can go U to (6,6), but earlier we saw that leads to death if I go to (5,6).\n\nFrom (6,6), I can only go L to (5,6), then from (5,6), as before, no moves.\n\nBut is (5,6) free? At that point, when I go to (5,6), the body might not be there yet.\n\nLet's simulate with eating only one food.\n\nAt t=14: move R to (6,5), eat, positions: [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nt=15: move U to (6,6), no eat, so move: head to (6,6), body: (6,5) moves to? Previous head (6,5), so first body (5,5) moves to (6,5), then (4,5) to (5,5), (3,5) to (4,5), tail (2,5) to (3,5). Positions: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nFrom (6,6), only move L to (5,6), since U, D, R invalid.\n\nt=16: move L to (5,6), no food, so head to (5,6), body: first body (6,5) moves to (6,6), second body (5,5) moves to (6,5), then (4,5) to (5,5), tail (3,5) to (4,5). Positions: [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nFrom (5,6), now I can move D to (5,5) but (5,5) is body, collision; L to (4,6) obstacle; U invalid; R to (6,6) body, collision. No valid moves, snake dies.\n\nSo indeed, going up to (6,6) is fatal.\n\nTherefore, from (6,5) after eating, I must go D to (6,4) to avoid that.\n\nThen from (6,4), I have to go L or D.\n\nIf I go L to (5,4), I can survive.\n\nNow, what about the food at (6,1)? I can go down to eat it later.\n\nFor example, from (6,4) after eating (6,4) at t=15, at t=16 I move L to (5,4), then from (5,4) I can move D to (5,3), then to (5,2), (5,1), then at (5,1) move R to (6,1) to eat at some turn.\n\nBut (6,1) has life 9, so I have time.\n\nBut the snake is longer, so moving down might be tight, but possible.\n\nIf I don't eat (6,5) at t=14, I can go elsewhere and eat (6,4) or (6,1) later.\n\nBut I miss the +1 from (6,5).\n\nSince all food is +1, eating it now gives immediate reward, and with careful play, I can survive.\n\nBut let's consider not eating it.\n\nAt t=14, move D to (5,4).\n\nThen positions: head to (5,4), no eat, so body: first body (4,5) moves to (5,5)? Previous head (5,5), so first body (4,5) moves to (5,5), then (3,5) to (4,5), tail (2,5) to (3,5). New positions: [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] length 4, tail at (3,5).\n\nFrom (5,4), direction now D, so can move D to (5,3), L to (4,4), R to (6,4) to eat food.\n\n(6,4) has food, so if I move R to (6,4), I eat it at t=15.\n\nThen grow to length 5 at (6,4).\n\nThen from (6,4), I can go D to (6,3) or L to (5,4), but (5,4) is previous position, now body? Positions after eat: head (6,4), body (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) — since tail didn't move.\n\nThen from (6,4), move to (6,3) or (5,4), but (5,4) is body, so L to (5,4) invalid, only D to (6,3).\n\nThen continue down.\n\nOr from (6,4) move D to (6,3), then to (6,2), (6,1) to eat.\n\nBut similar to before.\n\nIf at t=14 I move D to (5,4), and at t=15 I don't go to (6,4), I can go elsewhere, but (6,4) is there, I can eat it later.\n\nBut to maximize, I should eat it when possible.\n\nBut let's think about the tail reward danger.\n\nIn this state, no food under tail, so no issue.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (6,5) will be lost if not eaten, so to maximize score, I should eat it.\n\nAnd since I can avoid death by going down from (6,5), it seems better to eat it.\n\nThen I can eat (6,4) soon after or later.\n\nBut if I eat both, I grow faster, but might be constrained.\n\nIf I eat only (6,5) at t=14, then at t=15 from (6,5) move D to (6,4) but not necessarily eat, but (6,4) has food, so if I move to it, I eat.\n\nI could move to (6,4) without eating if I don't move to it, but since food is there, moving to it eats it.\n\nUnless I avoid.\n\nBut why avoid? To save it for later or something, but it has life span, I can eat it now.\n\nBut let's plan 5 turns ahead.\n\nCurrent turn t=14.\n\nI need to output actions for t=14, t=15, etc., but the instruction is to output for multiple turns, but I think for the answer, I need to specify the action for the current turn and a few ahead, but since the state changes, I might need to think ahead but output only the sequence based on current state.\n\nThe answer format is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., so for several turns.\n\nBut the state may have food disappearing, so I need to consider that.\n\nPerhaps for now, decide t=14 action.\n\nLet's list possible actions for t=14:\n\n- R: to (6,5), eat food, then at (6,5) with direction R, but moved to (6,5), new position.\n\n- U: to (5,6), then as before, forced to (6,6) then (6,5) empty, etc.\n\n- D: to (5,4), then I can go to (6,4) or other.\n\nIf I move U or D, I miss the (6,5) food.\n\nSince all food is +1, missing one means less score.\n\nWith the snake, I can eat other food later.\n\nBut to maximize, I should eat when possible.\n\nMoreover, long-term, having a shorter snake might be easier to maneuver, but eating food increases length, which might make it harder to survive, but the goal is to maximize score, so I need to eat as much as possible while surviving.\n\nBut in this case, if I eat (6,5), I get +1, and I can still access other areas.\n\nIf I don't eat, I have a shorter snake but missed a food.\n\nBut there are other foods.\n\nThe food at (6,1) is far, so I need to go down.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (4,6) blocks the top, so I might want to avoid the top-right corner.\n\nLet's see if I can eat (6,5) and then go down to (6,4) later, but at t=15, if I am at (6,5), I have to move U or D, if I move D, I eat (6,4), which is fine.\n\nThen I can go left.\n\nBut at (6,4), after eating, I can go L to (5,4), then down to (5,3), etc.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can go to the left or down.\n\nFor example, to eat (6,1), I can go to (5,1) then R to (6,1).\n\nBut the tail is following, so as I move down, the tail moves from the top, freeing space.\n\nInitially tail at (2,5) or after moves.\n\nLet's outline a sequence.\n\nAt t=14: move R to (6,5), eat food. Score +1, length 5.\n\nPositions: [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nDirection: after moving R, direction is R, but now at (6,5), on right edge.\n\nt=15: move D to (6,4), eat food at (6,4). Score +1, length 6.\n\nPositions: [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]  (since ate, tail didn't move)\n\nt=16: from (6,4), move L to (5,4), no food, so move: head to (5,4), body: first body (6,5) moves to (6,4), second body (5,5) moves to (6,5), then (4,5) to (5,5), (3,5) to (4,5), tail (2,5) to (3,5). Positions: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nTail at (3,5).\n\nFrom (5,4), direction L (since moved left), so can move U, D, L. R would be opposite, invalid? Current direction is L, so can't move R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,5) but (5,5) is body, collision; D to (5,3) possible; L to (4,4) possible; R invalid.\n\nSo U invalid, only D or L.\n\nSay move D to (5,3).\n\nt=17: move D to (5,3), no food, positions: head to (5,3), body: (6,4) moves to (5,4)? Previous head (5,4), so first body (6,4) moves to (5,4), second body (6,5) moves to (6,4), then (5,5) to (6,5), (4,5) to (5,5), tail (3,5) to (4,5). Positions: [(5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)] tail at (4,5).\n\nFrom (5,3), direction D, so can move D to (5,2), L to (4,3), R to (6,3). U invalid.\n\nAll possible, no body there.\n\nSay move D to (5,2).\n\nt=18: move D to (5,2), no food, positions: head (5,2), body (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), tail (4,5) to (5,5)? Etc.\n\nThen I can continue to (5,1), then R to (6,1) to eat at some point.\n\n(6,1) food has life 9, so at t=14 to t=23, I have time.\n\nFor example, at t=19, from (5,2) move D to (5,1), then t=20 move R to (6,1) eat.\n\nBut at t=20, (6,4) food disappears if not eaten, but I already ate it at t=15.\n\n(6,4) life 6 from t=14, so at t=20 it disappears, but I ate it at t=15.\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) life 9, from t=14, disappears after t=22, so I can eat by t=22.\n\nIn this sequence, at t=20 I can eat (6,1).\n\nBut in the positions, when I move to (6,1), it should be free.\n\nAt t=20, move to (6,1) eat, grow.\n\nThen from there, I can go L or U, etc.\n\nBut I need to output actions for the next few turns.\n\nThe answer should be for t=14 and then t=15, etc., but I don't need to output all the way to t=20, just a few steps.\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions, probably for the current and next few.\n\nSince the state changes, I might output based on current state.\n\nFor t=14, I think moving R to eat (6,5) is best to not miss the food.\n\nThen for t=15, from there, move D to (6,4) to eat that food.\n\nThen for t=16, move L to (5,4) to get away from the wall.\n\nThen for t=17, I can move D to (5,3), etc.\n\nBut I need to specify the sequence.\n\nSince the food at (6,4) has life 6, I could delay eating it, but no reason to, as it might be risky later.\n\nSimilarly, if I don't eat (6,5), I can go to (5,4) at t=14, then to (6,4) at t=15 to eat, but I missed (6,5).\n\nSo net, I get one less food if I don't eat (6,5).\n\nUnless I can eat both later, but (6,5) disappears, so I can't.\n\nSo to maximize score, I should eat (6,5) now.\n\nMoreover, with the sequence above, I can survive and eat other food.\n\nTherefore, for t=14, action R.\n\nThen for t=15, from (6,5), move D to (6,4) to eat.\n\nThen for t=16, from (6,4), move L to (5,4).\n\nThen for t=17, from (5,4), I can move D to (5,3) or L to (4,4), but to head towards (6,1), moving down is better.\n\nAlso, the tail is at (3,5) or moving, so no immediate danger.\n\nNow, about the answer format: I need to output for turn t1=14, then t1+1=15, etc.\n\nProbably for several turns, but I can do 3 or 4 turns.\n\nThe instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions in the box.\n\nI think outputting for t=14 to t=17 or so is fine.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 14: R\n\nTurn 15: D (from (6,5) to (6,4))\n\nTurn 16: L (from (6,4) to (5,4))\n\nThen for turn 17, from (5,4), I can go D to (5,3), as above.\n\nBut let's confirm if at (5,4) at t=16, direction is L (since moved left), so can move D or L.\n\nU and R invalid as before.\n\nMove D to (5,3).\n\nThen turn 18, to (5,2), etc.\n\nBut I don't need to output that far.\n\nFor the answer, I can output up to turn 17 or 18.\n\nSince the food at (6,1) is far, no need to specify now.\n\nAnother thing: the tail reward danger. In this case, no food under tail, so no issue.\n\nAlso, when I eat (6,4), the head is not adjacent to tail, so fine.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo I think this is safe.\n\nIf at t=14 I move D to (5,4), then I miss (6,5), but can eat (6,4) at t=15, and (6,1) later, so only two food instead of three, so score 2 vs 3.\n\nBy eating (6,5), I can get three, so better.\n\nTherefore, I should eat (6,5) now.\n\nFinal decision.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, the AI must think 5+ turns ahead. The immediate food at (6,5) with a life span of 1 must be eaten on turn 14 or it will disappear. Eating it provides a +1 score and increases the snake's length to 5. After eating, moving down to (6,4) on turn 15 allows the snake to eat another +1 food (life span 6, so it can be eaten later but doing so now prevents future risks and secures the point). On turn 16, moving left to (5,4) avoids the dangerous corner and opens up the board for future movement toward the food at (6,1). Continuing down to (5,3) on turn 17 maintains flexibility and positions the snake to navigate toward the bottom food while avoiding collisions.\n\nThis sequence ensures both immediate rewards and long-term survival:\n- Eating (6,5) on turn 14 avoids missing the high-risk food.\n- Eating (6,4) on turn 15 capitalizes on proximity and frees the snake to move left.\n- Moving left on turn 16 escapes the right wall, reducing enclosure risk.\n- Moving down on turn 17 begins the path toward (6,1) while keeping the snake centered for more options.\n\nRisks are mitigated:\n- No tail reward danger exists, as no food is under the tail.\n- Collisions are avoided by not moving into walls or body segments.\n- The sequence ensures the snake does not get trapped in the top-right corner, as seen in alternative paths.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 14: R (right)  \nTurn 15: D (down)  \nTurn 16: L (left)  \nTurn 17: D (down)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 15. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: head at (6,5), then body segments at (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5). So the snake is horizontal, facing right, with head at (6,5) and tail at (2,5). Length is 5 segments.\n\nHead direction is R, meaning it was moving right to get to (6,5).\n\nFood:\n\n- One at (6,4) with life span 5 and value +1. Since it's turn 15, this food will disappear after 5 turns, so on turn 20 (15 + 5 = 20). Life span decreases each turn, including current, so after turn 15, it has 5 turns left, meaning it vanishes after turn 19 or before turn 20? Let's clarify the life span countdown.\n\nThe rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn 15, life span is 5. After turn 15, it decreases to 4, and so on, until it reaches 0. When life span is 1 on turn t, it can be eaten on turn t, and then it disappears. If not eaten by the turn when life span would decrease to 0, it disappears before the next turn. Typically, food with life span N can be eaten from turn t to turn t + N - 1, and disappears at the start of turn t + N.\n\nBut to be precise: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at the start of turn t, if food has life span L, it can be eaten during turn t. After turn t, L decreases by 1. So for food at (6,4) with life span 5 on turn 15:\n\n- Turn 15: life span 5, can be eaten\n\n- After turn 15, life span 4\n\n- Turn 16: life span 4, can be eaten\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn 19: life span 1, can be eaten\n\n- After turn 19, life span 0, disappears before turn 20.\n\nSimilarly, the other food at (6,1) with life span 8: on turn 15, life span 8, so it can be eaten until turn 22 (15 + 8 - 1 = 22), disappears before turn 23.\n\nBoth foods have value +1, so positive food.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks. Survival is key.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid:\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) for all x,y.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), so that cell is blocked.\n\nSnake: positions (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) – all at y=5, x from 2 to 6.\n\nHead at (6,5), moving right. But since it's at x=6, and x=7 is wall, it can't move right because (7,5) is wall. Head direction is R, but at position (6,5), moving right would be to (7,5), which is wall, so collision. But the snake is currently at (6,5), so for the next move, from (6,5), it can choose a direction.\n\nHead direction is given as \"R\", which is the direction it was moving to get to the current head position. So from previous position, it moved right to (6,5). Now for turn 15, it needs to choose a new direction.\n\nPossible moves from (6,5):\n\n- Up: to (6,6) – y+1\n\n- Down: to (6,4) – y-1\n\n- Left: to (5,5)\n\n- Right: to (7,5) but x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n\nAlso, cannot move opposite to current direction. Current head direction is R, so opposite is L (left). So it cannot move left to (5,5) because that would be opposite to R.\n\nRule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nCurrent direction is R (since head direction is given as R), so from (6,5), it cannot move left to (5,5).\n\nValid moves:\n\n- Up: to (6,6)\n\n- Down: to (6,4)\n\n- Right: to (7,5) but wall, invalid.\n\nSo only up or down are possible.\n\n(6,6): is that within bounds? y=6, x=6. Grid y from 0 to 7, so y=6 is not wall, but let's see walls: border walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So (6,6) is inside, not wall. Internal obstacle is at (4,6), not (6,6).\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) is inside.\n\nBut (6,4) has food! Positive food at (6,4) with value +1.\n\nIf I move down to (6,4), I can eat the food there.\n\nBut let's check if it's safe.\n\nFirst, moving to (6,4): the head moves to (6,4), which has food, so I eat it, snake grows by one segment. New positions: head at (6,4), then the body: since it eats, the tail doesn't move, so new segments: (6,4) as new head, then previous head (6,5) becomes part of body, then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5). So snake becomes [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)] – length 6.\n\nBut is there any danger? Tail is at (2,5), which is far, so no tail reward danger here.\n\nAlso, collision: (6,4) is not occupied by body yet; currently, body is at (5,5), (4,5), etc., and (6,4) is empty except for food, so no collision.\n\nBut after moving, the body will be at (6,5), which is now part of body, but head is at (6,4), so no issue.\n\nNow, what about the other option: moving up to (6,6).\n\n(6,6) is empty, no food, so no eating, snake moves, head to (6,6), tail moves forward, so positions: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] – tail (2,5) is removed, so length remains 5.\n\n(2,5) is removed, so new tail is (3,5), but positions: head (6,6), then (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5). Yes.\n\nNow, at (6,6), is it safe? No immediate collision.\n\nBut I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving down to eat the food at (6,4).\n\nTurn 15: move D to (6,4), eat food, grow to length 6. Positions: head (6,4), body: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nHead direction now: since moved down, direction is D.\n\nNow, for turn 16, from (6,4), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: cannot reverse to up, so cannot go to (6,5) because that's opposite to current D.\n\nCurrent direction is D (down), so opposite is U (up).\n\nValid moves:\n\n- Left: to (5,4)\n\n- Right: to (7,4) but x=7 wall, invalid.\n\n- Down: to (6,3)\n\n- Up: to (6,5) but cannot, reverse.\n\nSo only left or down.\n\n(5,4) or (6,3).\n\n(5,4): is it occupied? Current body: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), etc. (5,4) is not in positions, so empty.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) empty.\n\nNo food at these points yet.\n\nFood is only at (6,4) which will be eaten now, and (6,1) which is far.\n\n(6,4) food is eaten on turn 15, so it disappears.\n\nOther food at (6,1).\n\nNow, if I go left to (5,4) or down to (6,3).\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nPerhaps I should not eat the food immediately if it leads to danger.\n\nBut here, eating at (6,4) seems fine, but let's see the position after.\n\nAfter eating, snake is at (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nNow, from (6,4), I can move left to (5,4) or down to (6,3).\n\nIf I move down to (6,3), then positions: head (6,3), body (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) – tail (2,5) removed? No, when I move without eating, tail moves.\n\nTurn 16: from (6,4), move down to (6,3), no food, so head to (6,3), body: since no eat, tail moves, so new positions: head (6,3), then (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) – tail (3,5) is removed, but (3,5) was part, now removed, so body: (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), and head (6,3), so positions: [(6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)] length 5.\n\nSimilarly, if move left to (5,4), positions: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)] and tail (3,5) removed.\n\nBut (5,5) is still there.\n\nNow, the other food at (6,1) is below, at y=1.\n\nAlso, there is an internal obstacle at (4,6), which might be relevant.\n\nBut let's think about the risk of eating the food at (6,4).\n\nOne thing: the food is at (6,4), and the snake body is at (6,5), which is directly above. After moving down to (6,4), the body segment at (6,5) is still there, and since we eat, it becomes part of the body.\n\nBut the rule about food under body: it says food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves on.\n\nIn this case, the food is not under the body; (6,4) is not occupied by snake currently. Snake is at y=5, (6,4) is below, empty except for food.\n\nSo it's fine to eat.\n\nBut there is a \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n\nBut here, tail is at (2,5), head at (6,5) before move, not adjacent. After eating, head at (6,4), tail at (2,5), not adjacent. So no issue.\n\nSo eating at (6,4) seems safe and beneficial.\n\nBut let's see the long-term path to the other food at (6,1).\n\n(6,1) is at the bottom, near the wall.\n\ny=1, x=6.\n\nGrid has walls at y=0, so (6,0) is wall, but (6,1) is not wall.\n\nNow, if I eat at (6,4) on turn 15, I have a longer snake, which might make movement harder in the confined space.\n\nThe snake is currently at the right side, x=6, which is near wall x=7.\n\nFrom (6,4), after eating, I need to move, say, down towards (6,1) or left.\n\nBut let's list all possible moves for the next few turns.\n\nFirst, turn 15 options:\n\nOption A: Move down to (6,4), eat food, grow to 6 segments.\n\nThen turn 16: from (6,4), direction D, can move left to (5,4) or down to (6,3).\n\nIf move down to (6,3), no food, move to (6,3), positions: head (6,3), body (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) – length 5 (since no eat, tail moved).\n\nTurn 16: after eating on turn 15, snake is length 6. When I move on turn 16 without eating, it shrinks back? No.\n\nWhen you eat, the snake grows, and when you don't eat, it moves without growing, so length stays the same, but the tail moves forward.\n\nAfter turn 15: ate, so positions: [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)] length 6.\n\nTurn 16: if I move to (6,3), no food there, so head moves to (6,3), and tail moves from (2,5) to? The last segment (2,5) is removed, so new positions: head (6,3), then (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) – length 6, tail at (3,5).\n\nSimilarly, if I move left to (5,4) on turn 16, positions: head (5,4), then (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5).\n\nNow, from there, I can continue.\n\nBut let's think about getting to (6,1).\n\nFrom (6,3), I can move down to (6,2), then to (6,1).\n\nBut (6,1) has food, so I can eat it later.\n\nBut the life span is 8, so I have time.\n\nNow, if I don't eat the food at (6,4) on turn 15, I move up to (6,6).\n\nTurn 15: move U to (6,6), no food, so positions: head (6,6), body (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) – tail (2,5) removed, length 5.\n\nHead direction now U.\n\nTurn 16: from (6,6), direction U, can move up, down, left, right, but cannot move down (reverse).\n\nValid moves:\n\n- Up to (6,7) but y=7 is wall, invalid\n\n- Left to (5,6)\n\n- Right to (7,6) wall, invalid\n\n- Down to (6,5) but cannot, reverse.\n\nSo only left to (5,6).\n\nMust move left to (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is empty, no food.\n\nPositions: head (5,6), body (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) – tail (3,5) removed? Previous positions before move: head (6,6), body (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5). After moving to (5,6), no eat, so head (5,6), then (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) – length 5, tail at (4,5).\n\nNow, at (5,6), which is near the internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is obstacle, so cannot go there.\n\nFrom (5,6), direction? Moved left from (6,6), so direction L.\n\nTurn 17: from (5,6), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: cannot move right (reverse to L), so no to (6,6).\n\nValid moves:\n\n- Up to (5,7) but y=7 wall, invalid\n\n- Down to (5,5)\n\n- Left to (4,6) but (4,6) is obstacle, invalid\n\n- Right to (6,6) cannot, reverse.\n\nSo only down to (5,5).\n\n(5,5) is currently occupied by body? Current positions: after turn 16, positions are [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\n(5,5) is the fourth segment, so it's occupied.\n\nIf I move down to (5,5), head would be moving to a body segment, collision!\n\n(5,5) is part of the body, so moving to (5,5) would cause head to touch body, death.\n\nTherefore, moving up on turn 15 leads to a dead end on turn 17.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nTurn 15: move U to (6,6)\n\nTurn 16: only move L to (5,6)\n\nTurn 17: from (5,6), only possible move is down to (5,5), but (5,5) is body, collision.\n\nTherefore, moving up on turn 15 is fatal and must be avoided.\n\nSo the only safe move on turn 15 is down to (6,4) to eat the food.\n\nThen, as before, on turn 16, from (6,4), direction D, can move L to (5,4) or D to (6,3).\n\nNow, I need to plan beyond.\n\nFirst, let's eat the food on turn 15.\n\nTurn 15: move D to (6,4), eat food, snake grows to length 6: positions [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nHead direction D.\n\nTurn 16: from (6,4), direction D, moves: L to (5,4) or D to (6,3)\n\nNow, which one to choose?\n\nI need to get to the other food at (6,1) and also survive long-term.\n\nAlso, the grid has limited space, especially with the snake longer.\n\nFood at (6,1) has life span 8, from turn 15, so it can be eaten until turn 22.\n\nTurn 15: life span 8, after turn 15, span 7, ..., turn 22: life span 1, can be eaten, after turn 22, disappears.\n\nSo we have time to reach it.\n\nNow, from (6,4), if I move down to (6,3), that's closer to (6,1).\n\nIf I move left to (5,4), that might lead to other areas.\n\nBut let's see the positions.\n\nFirst, option: move down to (6,3) on turn 16.\n\nTurn 16: move D to (6,3), no food there, so positions: head (6,3), body (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) – tail (2,5) removed, so [(6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] length 6.\n\nHead direction D.\n\nNow, from (6,3), can move: direction D, so cannot move up (reverse).\n\nValid moves:\n\n- Left to (5,3)\n\n- Down to (6,2)\n\n- Right to (7,3) wall, invalid\n\n- Up to (6,4) cannot, reverse.\n\nSo L to (5,3) or D to (6,2).\n\n(6,2) is empty, no food.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) empty.\n\nNow, food at (6,1), so moving down to (6,2) gets closer.\n\nThen from (6,2), can move down to (6,1) to eat.\n\nBut need to check if possible.\n\nTurn 17: from (6,3), say move D to (6,2), no food, positions: head (6,2), body (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) – tail (3,5) removed? Previous: [(6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)], after move to (6,2) no eat, head (6,2), then (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) – tail (3,5) removed, so length 6? Positions: head (6,2), body segments: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) – that's 6 segments, yes.\n\n(4,5) is the last, tail.\n\nNow turn 18: from (6,2), direction D, move D to (6,1), which has food, so eat it.\n\n(6,1) has food with value +1, so eat, grow to length 7.\n\nPositions: head (6,1), then (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) – and tail doesn't move, so now length 7.\n\nHead direction D.\n\nNow, after eating at (6,1), the snake is at the bottom, near wall y=0.\n\nFrom (6,1), direction D, can move: cannot up (reverse).\n\nValid moves:\n\n- Left to (5,1)\n\n- Down to (6,0) but y=0 wall, invalid\n\n- Right to (7,1) wall, invalid\n\n- Up to (6,2) cannot, reverse.\n\nSo only left to (5,1).\n\nMust move left to (5,1).\n\n(5,1) is empty, no food.\n\nPositions: move to (5,1), no eat, so head (5,1), body (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5) – tail (4,5) removed? Previous after eat: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)], after move to (5,1) no eat, head (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5) – tail (4,5) removed, so positions: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)] length 7? Head (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5) – but (5,5) is at x=5,y=5, which is fine, but the body is from (6,1) to (6,5) and (5,5).\n\nNow, from (5,1), direction? Moved left from (6,1), so direction L.\n\nTurn 19: from (5,1), direction L.\n\nCan move: cannot right to (6,1) (reverse).\n\nValid moves:\n\n- Up to (5,2)\n\n- Down to (5,0) wall, invalid\n\n- Left to (4,1)\n\n- Right to (6,1) cannot.\n\nSo U to (5,2) or L to (4,1).\n\nNow, the grid has an internal obstacle at (4,6), but that's far.\n\nSnake body occupies many cells, so need to be careful not to trap itself.\n\nFor example, from (5,1), if I move up to (5,2), or left to (4,1).\n\n(4,1) might be better to go left.\n\nBut let's see the space.\n\nI need to think about survival beyond eating the food.\n\nIn this path, I eat both foods: (6,4) on turn 15 and (6,1) on turn 18.\n\nScore increases by 2.\n\nBut after that, the snake is at the bottom left, with body above, so it might be constrained.\n\nBack to turn 16 choice.\n\nAfter turn 15, at (6,4) D direction.\n\nOn turn 16, instead of moving down, I could move left to (5,4).\n\nTurn 16: move L to (5,4), no food, positions: head (5,4), body (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) – tail (2,5) removed, so [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] length 6.\n\nHead direction L.\n\nNow, from (5,4), direction L, can move: cannot right to (6,4) (reverse).\n\nValid moves:\n\n- Up to (5,5)\n\n- Down to (5,3)\n\n- Left to (4,4)\n\n- Right cannot.\n\n(5,5) is occupied by body! Current positions: (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)\n\n(5,5) is the fourth segment, so if I move up to (5,5), head touches body, collision.\n\nTherefore, cannot move up to (5,5).\n\nDown to (5,3) or left to (4,4).\n\n(5,3) empty, (4,4) empty.\n\nNow, if I move down to (5,3), or left to (4,4).\n\nBut I need to reach (6,1) eventually.\n\n(6,1) is at (6,1), so from here, moving down might be better.\n\nTurn 17: from (5,4), say move D to (5,3), no food, positions: head (5,3), body (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) – tail (3,5) removed, so [(5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)] length 6.\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen from (5,3), can move down to (5,2), or left to (4,3), etc., but (6,1) is to the right and down, so I might need to go right later, but with body there, it might be blocked.\n\nFor example, to reach (6,1) from (5,3), I need to go to (6,3) or something.\n\nBut (6,3) is not occupied now, but might be later.\n\nIn the first path, by going down directly, I can reach (6,1) quickly.\n\nMoreover, in the first path, I eat both foods with no issue.\n\nNow, back to turn 16, if I move left to (5,4), then I cannot move up, so I have to move down or left.\n\nIf I move down to (5,3), then I am at (5,3), with body above at (5,4), etc.\n\nTo get to (6,1), I need to go right to (6,3) or something, but (6,4) and (6,5) are body, so from (5,3), I can move down to (5,2), then (5,1), then right to (6,1)? But (6,1) is at x=6,y=1, from (5,1) I can move right to (6,1), but on turn 19 or so.\n\nBut in the first path, I eat on turn 18, which is fine.\n\nAlso, life span allows.\n\nBut in the left move path, I might not eat the (6,1) food directly or later.\n\nBut I can still reach it.\n\nHowever, the first path seems more direct and I eat both foods.\n\nNow, about the tail reward danger: in the eating at (6,1), when I move to (6,1), head at (6,1), is tail adjacent? When I eat at (6,1), positions before move: head at (6,2), body (6,3), etc., tail at (4,5) or something, far away, not adjacent, so no danger.\n\nSimilarly, after eating, tail is at (4,5), head at (6,1), not adjacent.\n\nSo safe.\n\nNow, after eating both, I need to survive, but since the game continues, I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nIn the first path, after turn 18, I am at (6,1) with direction D, then must move left to (5,1), then from there, I can move up or left.\n\nThe space on the bottom might be tight.\n\nFor example, from (5,1), I can move up to (5,2) or left to (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is free.\n\nThen I can continue moving left or up.\n\nBut the snake is long, and the grid has obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), which is top-left, not affecting bottom immediately.\n\nBut the bottom rows might have space.\n\ny from 0 to 7, bottom is y=0,1,2, etc.\n\nI can move the snake to the left side.\n\nFor instance, from (5,1), move left to (4,1), then to (3,1), etc., towards the tail area.\n\nBut tail is around (4,5) or something, which might move.\n\nTo maximize survival, I should avoid boxing myself in.\n\nBut for now, since I need to plan 5+ turns, and turn 15 to 20 or so.\n\nAnother thing: on turn 16, if I move down to (6,3), I can proceed to eat (6,1) on turn 18.\n\nIf I move left to (5,4) on turn 16, I might delay eating (6,1) and risk not getting it or something.\n\nBut life span is long, turn 22 last chance.\n\nBut to be efficient, direct path is better.\n\nMoreover, moving left might lead to dead ends faster.\n\nFor example, if on turn 16 I move left to (5,4), then turn 17 I must move down or left, say down to (5,3).\n\nThen at (5,3), I can move down to (5,2), etc.\n\nBut to reach (6,1), I need to go to (6,2) or something, but (6,4) and (6,5) are body, so from (5,2), I can move right to (6,2), then down to (6,1).\n\nBut (6,2) might be free at that time.\n\nHowever, it takes more turns, and I might have the snake body blocking.\n\nIn terms of turns, if I go directly down, I eat on turn 18.\n\nIf I go left first, I might eat later, but still possible.\n\nBut since I need to maximize score, eating both is good, and I have time.\n\nBut also, after eating, longer snake might be harder to maneuver, but I can handle.\n\nNow, another point: the food at (6,4) has shorter life span, only 5 turns, so if I don't eat it now, it disappears soon.\n\nTurn 15: life span 5, so after turn 19 it disappears.\n\nIf I don't eat on turn 15, and I move up, but we saw moving up is fatal, so I must move down to eat it.\n\nOn turn 15, only down is possible, since up leads to death.\n\nTherefore, I must move down on turn 15 to (6,4) and eat the food.\n\nThen on turn 16, I need to choose between left or down.\n\nMoving down gets me closer to the other food faster.\n\nMoving left might explore other areas but with risk.\n\nSince the other food is at (6,1), moving down directly is better.\n\nMoreover, after eating (6,1), I can escape left.\n\nTherefore, for turn 15, action is D.\n\nThen turn 16, from (6,4) D direction, move D to (6,3).\n\nThen turn 17, from (6,3) D direction, move D to (6,2).\n\nThen turn 18, from (6,2) D direction, move D to (6,1), eat food.\n\nNow, beyond that, for survival.\n\nTurn 19: from (6,1) D direction, must move L to (5,1), as before.\n\nThen from (5,1) L direction, I need to move, say, up to (5,2) or left to (4,1).\n\nTo avoid trapping, I should move to open space.\n\nFor example, left to (4,1) might be better to go towards center.\n\n(4,1) is free.\n\nThen from there, I can continue.\n\nBut since the answer format requires actions for multiple turns, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the answer is to specify actions starting from turn t1.\n\nThe answer format is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t1: action\nTurn t1+1: action\n...\n}\n\nAnd it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but doesn't specify how many turns to output. Probably I need to output for a few turns, say 5 or so.\n\nSince t1=15, I can output turns 15 to 20 or something.\n\nIn this case, from turn 15 to 18, I have actions: 15:D, 16:D, 17:D, 18:D\n\nThen on turn 19, from (6,1) after eating, move L to (5,1)\n\nThen turn 20, from (5,1) L direction, I can move U to (5,2) or L to (4,1)\n\nWhich one?\n\n(5,2) might be free, (4,1) free.\n\nBut to plan ahead, if I move left to (4,1), then I can go up or something.\n\nSince the snake is long, I need to find a path without collision.\n\nFor example, positions on turn 19 after move: after turn 18, head at (6,1) after eat, positions: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)] length 7.\n\nThen turn 19: move L to (5,1), no eat, so head (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5) – tail (4,5) removed, so positions: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)]\n\nNow, from (5,1), direction L, can move U to (5,2), D to (5,0) invalid, L to (4,1), R cannot.\n\n(5,2) is not occupied? Current positions: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)\n\n(5,2) is not in the list, so empty.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) empty.\n\nIf I move U to (5,2), then positions: head (5,2), body (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5) – tail (5,5) removed? After move, head (5,2), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5) – and (5,5) was tail, removed, so positions: [(5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)] but (6,5) is at (6,5), and no (5,5) anymore.\n\nList: head (5,2), then segments: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5) – that's 7 segments? (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5) — yes, and (6,5) is the tail.\n\nNow, the body has a bend, but no immediate issue.\n\nIf I move left to (4,1) on turn 20, positions: head (4,1), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5) – tail (5,5) removed, so [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)]\n\nThen from there, I can move up to (4,2) or left to (3,1), etc.\n\nBoth seem possible, but moving left might be better to go away from the wall.\n\nFor the purpose, I can specify up to turn 19 or 20.\n\nBut let's go back to turn 16 choice.\n\nOn turn 16, if I move down to (6,3), I can eat (6,1) on turn 18.\n\nIf I move left to (5,4), I might not get to (6,1) directly.\n\nFor example, if turn 16 move L to (5,4), then turn 17 move D to (5,3), then turn 18 move D to (5,2), then turn 19 move D to (5,1), then turn 20 move R to (6,1)? But from (5,1), direction? Let's see.\n\nAfter turn 16: at (5,4) L direction.\n\nTurn 17: move D to (5,3), direction D.\n\nThen positions: head (5,3), body (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) – tail (3,5) removed earlier, so [(5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nTurn 18: from (5,3) D direction, move D to (5,2), no food, positions: head (5,2), body (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5) – tail (4,5) removed, so [(5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)]\n\n(5,5) is included.\n\nTurn 19: from (5,2) D direction, move D to (5,1), no food, positions: head (5,1), body (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) – tail (5,5) removed, so [(5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)]\n\nTurn 20: from (5,1) D direction, can move? Direction is D, so cannot move up.\n\nValid moves: left to (4,1), down to (5,0) invalid, right to (6,1), up cannot.\n\n(6,1) has food, and it's empty? Positions: (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) — (6,1) not occupied, so I can move right to (6,1) and eat the food.\n\nBut on turn 20, life span: original life span 8, turn 15 to 22, so turn 20 is fine, life span decreases to 3 or something, but can be eaten.\n\nSo I can eat on turn 20.\n\nBut in this case, I eat later, on turn 20 instead of turn 18.\n\nAnd I missed the opportunity to eat earlier.\n\nIn the first path, I eat on turn 18, so I get the score earlier and can potentially eat more, but no other food.\n\nBut score is the same, but eating earlier might be better for growth.\n\nBut in terms of survival, shorter snake might be easier, but here I grow by eating.\n\nIn first path, I grow to 6 on turn 15, to 7 on turn 18.\n\nIn second path, I grow to 6 on turn 15, then stay length 6 until turn 20 when I eat (6,1) to grow to 7.\n\nBut I have the food at (6,4) eaten on 15, so same.\n\nBut in the delay, I might have risk, but not necessarily.\n\nHowever, in the first path, by turn 18 I have eaten both, and I can start moving away.\n\nIn the second path, I eat later, so the snake is shorter for longer, which might be safer, but I still eat both.\n\nBut since the food at (6,1) is there, I can eat it anytime before turn 22.\n\nBut to be efficient, eating sooner might allow me to find more food, but in this grid, no other food mentioned, so probably only two foods.\n\nThe state only lists these two foods.\n\nSo I can eat both, and then survive.\n\nBut in the first path, after eating on turn 18, I am at bottom with long snake, which might be trapped.\n\nFor example, from (5,1) on turn 19, if I move up to (5,2), then I have body at (6,1) to (6,5), so the right column is blocked.\n\nThen I need to go left.\n\nSimilarly in both cases.\n\nBut moving down directly seems fine.\n\nMoreover, on turn 16, if I move left to (5,4), I had the risk of not being able to move up, but I moved down.\n\nBut in terms of getting to the food, direct is better.\n\nI think for turn 16, moving down to (6,3) is preferable to go towards the food.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 15: D (to eat (6,4))\n\nTurn 16: D (to (6,3))\n\nTurn 17: D (to (6,2))\n\nTurn 18: D (to (6,1) eat food)\n\nThen turn 19: L (to (5,1))\n\nNow, for turn 20, I need to decide.\n\nBut since the answer should include multiple turns, let's say up to turn 19 or 20.\n\nThe problem says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but doesn't specify output length. Probably output for 5 turns: turn 15 to 19 or 20.\n\nSince t1=15, turns 15 to 19 is 5 turns.\n\n15,16,17,18,19: that's 5 actions.\n\nAfter that, the snake can continue.\n\nFor turn 20, from (5,1) L direction, I can move L to (4,1) or U to (5,2).\n\nTo avoid the wall, moving left to (4,1) might be better.\n\nBut I don't need to specify beyond if not required.\n\nIn the answer, I should output the actions for the immediate turns.\n\nSo for turn 15: D\n\nTurn 16: D\n\nTurn 17: D\n\nTurn 18: D\n\nTurn 19: L\n\nBut on turn 19, moving L to (5,1) from (6,1).\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAfter turn 18: head at (6,1) after move and eat.\n\nThen turn 19: move L to (5,1)\n\nYes.\n\nNow, to confirm the directions.\n\nAlso, on turn 17, from (6,3) to (6,2), direction D, move D to (6,2), fine.\n\nTurn 18: from (6,2) D direction, move D to (6,1), fine.\n\nNo issue with reverse because direction is D, moving down.\n\nThen turn 19: from (6,1) direction D, move L to (5,1), which is left, not reverse, so ok.\n\nThen from (5,1), direction L.\n\nI think this is a good plan.\n\nIf on turn 16 I move left, it takes longer to eat the second food, but since I have time, it might be ok, but direct is efficient.\n\nMoreover, in the left path, when I move to (5,4), then down, the body might block the path to (6,1), but in this case, it was possible.\n\nBut I think down is better.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with moving down on turn 16.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 15: D\n\nTurn 16: D\n\nTurn 17: D\n\nTurn 18: D\n\nTurn 19: L\n\nBut turn 19 is moving to (5,1), which is the fifth action.\n\nSince thinking ahead, I have planned to eat both foods and start escaping.\n\nFor the answer, I need to output in the boxed format.\n\nAlso, the food at (6,4) is eaten on turn 15, which is before it expires.\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) on turn 18.\n\nLife span: (6,4) disappears after turn 19, eaten on 15, fine.\n\n(6,1) disappears after turn 22, eaten on 18, fine.\n\nNo negative food here.\n\nSo I think this is solid.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan for Turns 15 to 19\n\n**Current State (Turn 15):**\n- **Snake Position**: Head at (6,5), body segments at (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5). Snake length is 5.\n- **Head Direction**: Right (R), meaning the snake moved right to reach (6,5).\n- **Food**:\n  - (6,4): Value +1, life span 5 (can be eaten until turn 19, disappears before turn 20).\n  - (6,1): Value +1, life span 8 (can be eaten until turn 22, disappears before turn 23).\n- **Walls**: Borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7; internal obstacle at (4,6).\n- **Constraints**: \n  - From (6,5), moving right (to x=7) is invalid (wall). \n  - Moving left (to (5,5)) is invalid due to \"no instant reverse\" (current direction is R, opposite is L).\n  - Valid moves: Up (to (6,6)) or Down (to (6,4)).\n\n**Key Observations and Risks:**\n- **Immediate Move (Turn 15)**: Moving up to (6,6) leads to a dead end by turn 17 (forced moves result in body collision). Thus, moving down to (6,4) is the only safe option, allowing the snake to eat the positive food (+1 score, length increases to 6).\n- **Long-Term Goal**: After eating (6,4), prioritize reaching (6,1) to eat the second positive food (+1 score) while ensuring survival. (6,1) has a long life span (8 turns), so it can be eaten by turn 22. A direct downward path minimizes turns and avoids risks.\n- **Turn-by-Turn Planning**:\n  - **Turn 15**: Move down to (6,4) to eat food. This is safe (no body collision or tail reward danger) and maximizes score early.\n  - **Turn 16**: From (6,4) with direction Down (D), move down to (6,3). Moving left to (5,4) is possible but delays reaching (6,1) and risks body blockages later. Down is optimal for efficiency.\n  - **Turn 17**: From (6,3) with direction D, move down to (6,2). This continues the direct path to (6,1).\n  - **Turn 18**: From (6,2) with direction D, move down to (6,1) to eat the second food. This is safe (tail is distant, no collision).\n  - **Turn 19**: From (6,1) with direction D, move left to (5,1) to avoid the wall (y=0) and start escaping the bottom-right area. This opens paths to the left for future survival.\n- **Survival Beyond Turn 19**: After eating both foods, the snake length is 7. From (5,1), moving left (to (4,1)) or up (to (5,2)) is viable for long-term survival, but the plan focuses on the critical 5-turn horizon (turns 15-19) where both foods are secured.\n\n**Action Sequence (Turns 15-19):**\n- Turn 15: Down (eat food at (6,4), score +1, length 6).\n- Turn 16: Down (to (6,3), no food, length 6).\n- Turn 17: Down (to (6,2), no food, length 6).\n- Turn 18: Down (eat food at (6,1), score +1, length 7).\n- Turn 19: Left (to (5,1), no food, length 7).\n\nThis plan eats both positive foods (maximizing score by +2) within 4 turns and ensures survival through turn 19. Future moves (e.g., turn 20+) should focus on navigating left or up to avoid dead ends, leveraging the grid's open areas.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 15: D (down)\nTurn 16: D (down)\nTurn 17: D (down)\nTurn 18: D (down)\nTurn 19: L (left)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 16, and I'm playing Snake on a grid with walls and obstacles. The grid has borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There's an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: head at (6,4), then body segments at (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5). So the snake is 6 units long. Head direction is Down, meaning it was moving downward to reach (6,4) from (6,5)? Let's see the positions: from head to tail: (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), etc. If head is at (6,4) and previous was (6,5), that means it moved down from (6,5) to (6,4)? But (6,5) to (6,4) is moving down, and y decreases when moving down? I need to clarify the coordinate system.\n\nTypically, in such grids, (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? The problem says U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), L is (x-1,y), R is (x+1,y). So, if U is y+1, that means y increases upwards, so (0,0) is bottom-left, I assume. But let's confirm.\n\nU: (x, y+1) — that means moving up increases y.\n\nD: (x, y-1) — down decreases y.\n\nL: (x-1, y) — left decreases x.\n\nR: (x+1, y) — right increases x.\n\nSo, head is at (6,4), and it was moving Down to get there. From where? The previous position is (6,5), which is directly above since y=5 to y=4 is down. So yes, head moved from (6,5) to (6,4) with direction Down.\n\nNow, food positions:\n\n- (6,1) with life span 7, value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (1,6) with life span 10, value 1 (positive food)\n\nBoth are positive foods, no negative food mentioned.\n\nLife span: for (6,1), life span 7 at turn 16, so it will disappear after 7 turns, meaning it will be gone by turn 16 + 7 = 23? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 16, life span is 7, so it decreases to 6 on turn 17, and so on, until turn 16+7=23 when it should be gone? Let's see: if life span N at turn t, it disappears after N turns, meaning on turn t + N it is no longer present. Countdown decreases every turn, including current turn.\n\nThe rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nAt turn t, with life span N, after this turn, on turn t+1, life span becomes N-1. So at the start of turn t, life span is N, and during turn t, it can be eaten, and at the end of turn t, if not eaten, life span decreases to N-1 for turn t+1.\n\nSimilarly, it disappears when life span reaches 0? The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", meaning after N turns from now, it's gone.\n\nFor food at (6,1) at turn 16 with life span 7: it will be present on turns 16,17,18,19,20,21,22, and disappear on turn 23? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" — I think it means it lasts for N more turns, so it is available for N turns starting from now.\n\nSince countdown decreases every turn including current, at turn t, life span N, after turn t, life span N-1 for turn t+1, and so on, until life span 1 at turn t+N-1, then after that turn, it disappears, so not present on turn t+N.\n\nFor example, N=1 at turn t: present on turn t, after turn t, it disappears, so not on turn t+1.\n\nSimilarly, N=2: present on t and t+1, disappear on t+2.\n\nSo for (6,1) at t=16, life span 7: present on turns 16 to 22 inclusive, disappear on turn 23.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) life span 10: present on turns 16 to 25, disappear on turn 26.\n\nBoth have value 1, so positive.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nCurrent head position: (6,4), direction Down.\n\nPossible moves: I can move Up, Down, Left, Right, but with constraints.\n\nNo instant reverse: since current direction is Down, I cannot move Up next, because that would be opposite.\n\nCurrent direction is Down, so opposite is Up. So I cannot move Up on the next turn.\n\nAllowed moves: Down, Left, Right. Down is continuing down, Left or Right would be turning.\n\nNow, walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So moving to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 is wall collision.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), so cannot move there.\n\nAlso, body collision: if head touches any body segment except the tail, but since tail moves, moving to where tail is now might be ok if tail moves away.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, only safe if moving to the current tail position, because tail will move, so head and tail won't occupy same cell after move.\n\nOther body segments stay, so if head moves to a body cell, it collides unless it's the tail.\n\nNow, current snake positions: head (6,4), then (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5). Tail is (2,5).\n\nSo body cells: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5). But (2,5) is tail, so moving to (2,5) is ok if we do, but it might not be accessible now.\n\nFirst, let's list possible moves from (6,4):\n\n- Up: to (6,5) — but (6,5) is the second segment, the neck, which is a body part. Since it's not the tail, moving there would cause collision because head touches body segment. (6,5) is occupied by the snake body, and it's not the tail (tail is (2,5)), so moving to (6,5) would be immediate death.\n\n- Down: to (6,3) — is this within bounds? y=3, grid from y=0 to 7, so y=3 is ok. x=6, borders x=0 and 7, so x=6 is fine. No wall or obstacle mentioned at (6,3), so possible.\n\n- Left: to (5,4) — x=5,y=4. Is this occupied? Snake positions: (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), etc. (5,5) is body, (5,4) is not listed, so should be empty? Let's see all positions: head (6,4), then (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5). So (5,4) is not occupied, and no wall, so possible.\n\n- Right: to (7,4) — x=7, but border wall at x=7, so moving to (7,4) would be wall collision, death.\n\nx=7 is border, so cannot move to x=7.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 and y=7 borders.\n\nSo possible moves: Down to (6,3), Left to (5,4), or Right but Right to (7,4) is wall, so not possible. Up to (6,5) is body collision.\n\nSo only Down or Left are possible without immediate death.\n\nDown: (6,3)\n\nLeft: (5,4)\n\nNow, I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n\nAlso, food: (6,1) is below, at (6,1), and (1,6) is top-left.\n\n(6,1) is at x=6,y=1, which is down from current head (6,4), so y=1 is below.\n\n(1,6) is x=1,y=6.\n\nCurrent head (6,4).\n\nTo reach (6,1), I need to go down to y=1.\n\nBut from (6,4), down to (6,3), then (6,2), then (6,1), but (6,1) is food, so I could eat it in three moves if I go straight down.\n\nBut is there any risk?\n\nFirst, if I move down to (6,3), then the snake moves: head to (6,3), body follows, so tail moves from (2,5) to, let's see, the new positions: after move down, head at (6,3), then previous head (6,4) becomes body, so positions: [(6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]? Let's trace.\n\nCurrent positions: [ (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) ]\n\nAfter moving down to (6,3):\n\n- New head: (6,3)\n\n- Then the body: first segment is previous head (6,4), then (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), and tail (2,5) moves away? When head moves to a new cell, the tail is removed only if no food eaten. Since we didn't eat food, length same, so tail is removed, and the new body is from the previous positions except tail is cut.\n\nStandard snake: when moving, head moves to new cell, if no food, tail is removed, so snake shifts forward.\n\nSo here, moving to (6,3) no food eaten (yet), so:\n\n- Head moves to (6,3)\n\n- The segment that was at (6,4) is now the neck, at (6,4)\n\n- Then (6,5) still there\n\n- (5,5) still\n\n- (4,5) still\n\n- (3,5) still\n\n- And tail (2,5) is removed? Positions: after move, the snake occupies: head at (6,3), then the previous positions from head to second last: so previous head (6,4) now first body, then (6,5) second body, (5,5) third, (4,5) fourth, (3,5) fifth, and tail was (2,5) but since no food, tail is removed, so the last segment is (3,5), which was previously the fifth segment.\n\nList indices: positions indexed from 0: head [0] (6,4), [1] (6,5), [2] (5,5), [3] (4,5), [4] (3,5), [5] (2,5) tail.\n\nAfter move down to (6,3):\n\n- New head: (6,3)\n\n- Then new body: [0] becomes body at (6,4), [1] at (6,5), [2] at (5,5), [3] at (4,5), [4] at (3,5), and [5] (tail) is removed since no food eaten.\n\nSo new positions: [(6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] and tail is now (3,5), length 6 same.\n\n(3,5) was [4], now becomes the tail.\n\nSimilarly, if I move left to (5,4):\n\nHead to (5,4), then body: (6,4) becomes neck, then (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), tail (2,5) removed, so positions: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nNow, back to choices: from (6,4), I can go down to (6,3) or left to (5,4).\n\nIf I go down to (6,3), I'm closer to food at (6,1), which has life span 7, so plenty of time.\n\nBut let's see the risks.\n\nAt (6,3), what can I do next?\n\nAfter moving to (6,3), head direction would be Down.\n\nPossible moves: from (6,3), direction Down.\n\nCannot move Up (opposite), so can move Down, Left, Right.\n\nDown to (6,2): y=2, within bounds.\n\nLeft to (5,3): x=5,y=3, should be empty.\n\nRight to (7,3): x=7, wall, invalid.\n\nNow, (6,2) is empty, I assume.\n\nThen from (6,2), I can go down to (6,1) to eat the food.\n\nBut when I eat food, snake grows, so tail doesn't move, new segment added.\n\nBut first, let's check if (6,1) is safe to eat.\n\nThe rule about Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nHere, tail is currently at (2,5), which is far, not adjacent to head. Head at (6,4) or after move (6,3), tail at (3,5) or similar, still far. When I reach (6,1), tail might be different.\n\nAlso, (6,1) is not under the snake, so no issue with that special case.\n\nNow, if I go down to (6,3) now, then down to (6,2), then down to (6,1).\n\nOn turn when I move to (6,1), I eat the food, value +1, length increases by 1, so new tail added.\n\nAfter eating, positions: head at (6,1), previous head (6,2) becomes body, and so on, but since food eaten, tail not removed, so snake grows.\n\nSpecifically, from (6,2) to (6,1): head to (6,1), and since food eaten, the tail stays, so new positions: head (6,1), then (6,2), then (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) — wait no.\n\nBefore move: suppose after two moves: turn 16 move down to (6,3), positions: [(6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nTurn 17 move down to (6,2): head to (6,2), no food, so tail (3,5) removed, positions: [(6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)] tail at (4,5)\n\nTurn 18 move down to (6,1): head to (6,1), food there, so eat it, value +1, length increases, tail not removed. So new positions: head (6,1), then previous head (6,2) now body, then (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), and since ate food, add new segment where tail was? Standard: when eat food, the tail doesn't move, so the new segment is added at the tail position, but since tail didn't move, it stays, and snake grows.\n\nPositions: after move to (6,1) and eat: head (6,1), then (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) — and since ate, the tail (4,5) remains, but we add a new segment, so the segment that was tail is still there, and a new one added? No.\n\nTypically: the snake moves to new cell, if food, then the tail is not removed, so the snake has one more segment. The position where tail was remains part of the body.\n\nIn this case, before move to (6,1), positions: [(6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)] with head at (6,2), tail at (4,5)\n\nAfter moving to (6,1): head to (6,1), and since food eaten, tail not removed, so new positions: head (6,1), then (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) — so now 7 segments, tail at (4,5).\n\nYes.\n\nNow, is there any danger? At (6,1), after eating, head is at (6,1), and body includes (6,2), etc., no immediate collision.\n\nBut (6,1) is at y=1, which is above the bottom wall y=0, so I can still move, but moving down to (6,0) is wall, since y=0 border.\n\nSo after eating at (6,1), I need to move left or right or up, but not down.\n\nBut that's later.\n\nFirst, back to current turn.\n\nIf I go down to (6,3), it seems safe for now, and I can reach food in two more moves.\n\nBut let's consider the other option: moving left to (5,4).\n\nIf I move left to (5,4) at turn 16.\n\nHead to (5,4), no food eaten, so positions: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] tail at (3,5)\n\nHead direction now Left, since moved left.\n\nNow, from (5,4), possible moves: since direction Left, cannot move Right (opposite), so can move Up, Down, Left.\n\nUp to (5,5): but (5,5) is occupied by body? Positions: after move, body has (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), etc. (5,5) is the third segment, not tail, so moving to (5,5) would be collision.\n\nDown to (5,3): y=3, empty.\n\nLeft to (4,4): x=4,y=4, should be empty.\n\nSo possible: Down to (5,3) or Left to (4,4).\n\nIf I go left, I might be heading towards the other food at (1,6), but it's far.\n\n(1,6) is at x=1,y=6, which is up and left.\n\nBut life span 10, so time.\n\nBut going down to (6,3) seems more direct to the closer food.\n\nBut I need to think long-term. After eating (6,1), I might be in a corner or something.\n\nAlso, there's an obstacle at (4,6), which might block paths.\n\nMoreover, the snake body might create obstacles.\n\nBut let's think about the grid.\n\nGrid 8x8, walls at borders, obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake current: from (6,4) to (2,5), so it's along y=5 from x=2 to x=6, and head at (6,4).\n\nFood at (6,1) and (1,6).\n\n(6,1) is directly below head, but head at (6,4), so (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) are the path.\n\nBut after eating at (6,1), the snake will be longer, and I need to find a way out.\n\nFor example, from (6,1), I can move left to (5,1) or right to (7,1) but x=7 wall, so only left to (5,1).\n\nThen from there, etc.\n\nBut let's simulate a few turns.\n\nFirst, option 1: go down to (6,3) at turn 16.\n\nThen turn 17: from (6,3), I can go down to (6,2) or other, but to reach food, down to (6,2).\n\nTurn 17: move down to (6,2), positions: as before, [(6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)] tail at (4,5)\n\nHead direction Down.\n\nTurn 18: move down to (6,1), eat food, positions: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)] tail at (4,5), length 7.\n\nHead direction Down.\n\nNow at (6,1), I cannot go down to (6,0) wall. So must turn left or right. Right to (7,1) wall, so only left to (5,1).\n\nTurn 19: move left to (5,1), head direction Left.\n\nPositions: head (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), and since no food, tail (4,5) removed? Positions before move: head (6,1), body (6,2) to (4,5)\n\nAfter move to (5,1): head (5,1), then previous head (6,1) becomes body, then (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), and tail (4,5) removed, so positions: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)] tail at (5,5)\n\n(5,5) is now tail.\n\nNow, from (5,1), head direction Left, so can move Up, Down, Left (no right, opposite).\n\nUp to (5,2): y=2, empty.\n\nDown to (5,0): y=0, wall, invalid.\n\nLeft to (4,1): x=4,y=1, empty.\n\nSo can go up to (5,2) or left to (4,1).\n\nIf I go left to (4,1), then I'm moving left, away from the other food.\n\nBut other food at (1,6) is top-left.\n\nI could go up from (5,1) to (5,2), then to (5,3), etc., but need to avoid the body.\n\nPositions now: head (5,1), body at (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)\n\nSo (5,2) is empty, (5,3) empty, etc.\n\nFrom (5,1) move up to (5,2) turn 20.\n\nHead direction Up.\n\nThen from (5,2), can move up to (5,3), left to (4,2), right to (6,2) but (6,2) is body, occupied, so invalid.\n\n(6,2) is occupied by body, so cannot move there.\n\nSimilarly, down to (5,1) but that's where neck is, but (5,1) is now body, so moving down would be to (5,1) which is body, collision.\n\nAfter move to (5,2), positions: head (5,2), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), tail at (5,5)? Before move: positions [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)] head at (5,1)\n\nAfter move up to (5,2): head to (5,2), no food, so tail removed. Tail was (5,5), so removed. New positions: head (5,2), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)] tail at (6,5)\n\n(6,5) is tail.\n\nNow, from (5,2), direction Up, so can move Up, Left, Right (no down, opposite).\n\nUp to (5,3): empty.\n\nLeft to (4,2): empty.\n\nRight to (6,2): but (6,2) is occupied by body? Positions: body has (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), etc. (6,2) is the fourth segment, not tail, so occupied, cannot move there.\n\nSo only Up to (5,3) or Left to (4,2).\n\nSay I go up to (5,3).\n\nTurn 21: move to (5,3), positions: head (5,3), then (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)] tail at (6,4)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut I'm not heading towards the other food yet.\n\nNow, back to the beginning, I have another food at (1,6) with life span 10, so by turn 26 it disappears.\n\nBut I need to survive and eat it if possible.\n\nIf I go for (6,1) first, I eat it at turn 18, then I have time to go to (1,6).\n\nFrom the south, I need to navigate to north-west.\n\nBut there is an obstacle at (4,6), which is on the way.\n\n(4,6) is an internal obstacle, so cannot move there.\n\nAlso, the snake body might be in the way.\n\nBut let's see the other initial choice: at turn 16, instead of down, I go left to (5,4).\n\nThen turn 16: move left to (5,4), positions: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] tail at (3,5)\n\nHead direction Left.\n\nTurn 17: from (5,4), can move up, down, left as before.\n\nUp to (5,5) is body, collision.\n\nDown to (5,3): empty.\n\nLeft to (4,4): empty.\n\nSay I go left to (4,4) to head towards (1,6).\n\nTurn 17: move left to (4,4), positions: head (4,4), then (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)] tail at (4,5)? Before move: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] head (5,4)\n\nAfter move left to (4,4): head (4,4), no food, tail (3,5) removed, positions: [(4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)] tail at (4,5)\n\n(4,5) is tail.\n\nHead direction Left.\n\nNow from (4,4), can move up, down, left (no right).\n\nUp to (4,5): (4,5) is tail, so moving there is ok, because tail will move.\n\nDown to (4,3): empty.\n\nLeft to (3,4): empty.\n\nIf I move up to (4,5), which is tail, so no collision, and since it's tail, it moves away.\n\nAfter moving to (4,5), since it was tail, and no food, the tail moves, so positions: head (4,5), then previous head (4,4) becomes body, then (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), and the old tail (4,5) is no longer tail, but since we moved there, it's occupied.\n\nBefore move: positions [(4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)] with head at (4,4), tail at (4,5)\n\nAfter move to (4,5): head to (4,5), which was tail, so no food, tail is removed? When head moves to the tail position, since tail is there, but after move, the tail is gone.\n\nStandard: if head moves to the current tail position, since the tail will move away (if no food), but when head moves to tail cell, it's ok because the tail is leaving that cell.\n\nIn this case, moving to (4,5): head to (4,5), and since no food eaten, the tail is removed, so the cell is free.\n\nPositions: new head (4,5), then the previous positions except tail: so (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5) — and tail was (4,5) but removed, so new positions: [(4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)] tail at (5,5)\n\nHead direction, since moved up? From (4,4) to (4,5) is up, so direction Up.\n\nThen from there, I can continue.\n\nBut I was heading to (1,6), which is at (1,6), so I need to go left and up.\n\nBut (4,6) is obstacle, so I cannot go directly up from (4,5) because (4,6) is blocked.\n\nFrom (4,5), if I move up to (4,6), but (4,6) is obstacle, wall, so cannot.\n\nSo from (4,5), I can move left to (3,5), down to (4,4) but that's body now, or right, but direction is Up, so can move left, right, up, but up blocked, right to (5,5) is body, left to (3,5) empty.\n\n(3,5) is empty.\n\nSo move left to (3,5).\n\nBut this is getting messy.\n\nPerhaps going for (6,1) first is better because it's closer and I can eat it sooner.\n\nThen after that, I can plan to go to (1,6).\n\nBut let's see the time: turn 16, food at (6,1) disappears after turn 22, so I have until turn 22 to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) until turn 25.\n\nIf I go down now, I eat at turn 18.\n\nIf I go left, I might take longer to eat either.\n\nBut by going left, I might be able to eat both, but (6,1) is south, (1,6) is north, so I need to go back and forth, which might be risky with the snake body.\n\nMoreover, after eating (6,1), the snake is longer, making it harder to maneuver.\n\nBut in this case, snake is 6 now, after eating (6,1), 7, then if I eat (1,6), 8, etc.\n\nBut let's think about the grid space.\n\nThe grid is 8x8, so 64 cells, walls and obstacles take some.\n\nBorders: all x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? No.\n\nx from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so valid x: 1 to 6? Similarly y.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, so cells with x=0 or x=7 are invalid, similarly y=0 and y=7 invalid.\n\nSo playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to6, so 6x6=36 cells.\n\nAlso, internal obstacle at (4,6), which is within, so (4,6) is blocked.\n\nSo 35 playable cells? (4,6) is at y=6, which is border? y=0 and y=7 are borders, so y=6 is valid, but (4,6) is an internal obstacle, so it's a wall cell.\n\nSimilarly, x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6 are playable except obstacles.\n\ny=0 and y=7 are borders, so invalid, so y from 1 to 6.\n\nx from 1 to 6.\n\nSo cells (1,1) to (6,6), 36 cells.\n\nBut (4,6) is an obstacle, so 35 free cells.\n\nSnake is 6 cells, so 29 empty cells.\n\nAfter eating one food, snake 7, etc.\n\nBut to eat (1,6), I need to go there.\n\n(1,6) is at x=1,y=6.\n\nFrom current position, if I go left and up.\n\nBut if I go for (6,1) first, I can eat it quickly, then head to (1,6).\n\nAfter eating at (6,1) at turn 18, I am at (6,1) with snake as above.\n\nThen I can move left to (5,1), as I did earlier.\n\nThen from (5,1), I can go up to (5,2), then to (5,3), etc., towards (1,6).\n\nBut (1,6) is at y=6, x=1.\n\nObstacle at (4,6), so at y=6, cells (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (5,6), (6,6) are free, (4,6) blocked.\n\nSo I need to reach (1,6) from below or side.\n\nSince I'm at (5,1), I can go up the left side.\n\nFor example, from (5,1) move left to (4,1), then to (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), then up to (1,2), (1,3), etc. to (1,6).\n\nOr up first to (5,2), (5,3), etc., but need to avoid the body.\n\nIn the earlier simulation, when I was at (5,1), the body was along the bottom and right, so the left and top are free.\n\nPositions after eating at (6,1): turn 18, positions [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)] \n\nThen turn 19 move left to (5,1): positions [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)] tail at (5,5)\n\nThen turn 20 move up to (5,2): positions [(5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)] tail at (6,5)\n\nThen turn 21 move up to (5,3): positions [(5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)] tail at (6,4)\n\nThen turn 22 move up to (5,4): but (5,4) might be free, but let's see.\n\nAt turn 22, from (5,3) move to (5,4): head to (5,4), no food, so tail removed. Tail was (6,4), removed, positions: [(5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)] tail at (6,3)\n\n(5,4) is free.\n\nThen from (5,4), direction Up, can move up to (5,5), but (5,5) is not occupied now? Positions have (6,1) to (6,3), (5,1) to (5,4), so (5,5) is empty.\n\n(5,5) is empty, so can move up to (5,5).\n\nTurn 23: move to (5,5), positions: head (5,5), then (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)] tail at (6,2)\n\nThen from (5,5), can move up to (5,6), left to (4,5), right to (6,5), etc.\n\n(5,6) is at y=6, which is below y=7 border, so valid.\n\nMove up to (5,6) turn 24: head to (5,6), no food, tail removed, positions: [(5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1)] tail at (6,1)\n\nThen from (5,6), I can move left to (4,6), but (4,6) is obstacle, cannot.\n\nRight to (6,6): empty.\n\nOr down to (5,5), but that's body.\n\nDirection Up, so can move left, right, up, but up to (5,7) invalid, y=7 wall.\n\nSo left to (4,6) invalid, right to (6,6) valid.\n\nMove right to (6,6) turn 25: head to (6,6), positions: [(6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1)] tail at (5,1)\n\nNow, (1,6) is at (1,6), which is left, but I'm at (6,6), so I need to go left along y=6.\n\nBut y=6 has cells from x=1 to x=6, except (4,6) blocked.\n\nSo I can move left to (5,6) but occupied, or from (6,6), move left to (5,6) but (5,6) is neck, body, collision.\n\nFrom (6,6), head, direction after moving right? From (5,6) to (6,6) is right, so direction Right.\n\nCan move up, down, right, but up (6,7) wall, down to (6,5), right to (7,6) wall.\n\nDown to (6,5): is it occupied? Positions: body has (5,6), (5,5), etc., (6,5) not in positions, so empty.\n\n(6,5) is empty.\n\nSo move down to (6,5) turn 26: head to (6,5), no food, tail removed, positions: [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2)] tail at (5,2)\n\nBut (1,6) is still there, life span 10, at turn 16, so by turn 25 it is present? Life span 10 at turn 16, present on turns 16 to 25, disappear on turn 26.\n\nAt turn 25, it is still present, but I am at (6,6), and on turn 25 I move to (6,6), but (1,6) is not eaten.\n\nOn turn 25, I am at (6,6), and food at (1,6) is present, but I didn't eat it.\n\nOn turn 26, it disappears, so I missed it.\n\nIn this path, I was heading down to eat (6,1) first, then I went up the column, but ended up at (6,6) on turn 25, and (1,6) is at (1,6), which is far, and on turn 26 it disappears, so I can't eat it.\n\nIf at some point I go left instead.\n\nFor example, after eating at (6,1), at turn 19, instead of moving up, I move left to (4,1), then (3,1), etc. to (1,1), then up to (1,2), but to reach (1,6) I need to go up, which takes time.\n\nTurn 18 eat at (6,1)\n\nTurn 19 move left to (5,1) as before\n\nThen turn 20 move left to (4,1): from (5,1) move left to (4,1), positions: head (4,1), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)] tail at (6,5)? Before move: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)] at turn 19 after move to (5,1)\n\nTurn 20 move left to (4,1): head to (4,1), no food, tail (5,5) removed, positions: [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)] tail at (6,4)\n\nThen turn 21 move left to (3,1): positions [(3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)] tail at (6,3)\n\nTurn 22 move left to (2,1): positions [(2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)] tail at (6,2)\n\nTurn 23 move left to (1,1): positions [(1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)] tail at (6,1)\n\nNow at (1,1), I can move up to (1,2), etc. to (1,6).\n\n(1,6) is at y=6, so from (1,1) to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6).\n\nBut each move takes a turn.\n\nTurn 24 move up to (1,2)\n\nTurn 25 move up to (1,3)\n\nTurn 26 move up to (1,4)  but food at (1,6) disappears on turn 26, so on turn 26, when I move, it might be gone.\n\nLife span: at turn 16, life span 10, so present on turns 16 to 25, disappear at turn 26, so on turn 25, it is present, and I can eat it on turn 25 if I am there.\n\nOn turn 24, I am at (1,1), turn 25 I move to (1,2), not at (1,6).\n\nTo reach (1,6) from (1,1), I need 5 moves: to (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), so turn 25 to (1,2), turn 26 to (1,3), but on turn 26, food is gone, so I can't eat it.\n\nIf I were at (1,5) on turn 25, I could move to (1,6) on turn 25.\n\nBut on turn 24 I am at (1,1), so on turn 25 I can only be at (1,2) if I move up.\n\nSo I cannot reach (1,6) in time if I go to (6,1) first and then left and up.\n\nThe only way to eat both is to go for (1,6) first, since it has longer life, but it's farther.\n\nAt turn 16, if I go left towards (1,6).\n\nFor example, turn 16 move left to (5,4)\n\nTurn 17 move left to (4,4)\n\nTurn 18 move left to (3,4) or up, but to go to (1,6), I need to go up as well.\n\nFrom (4,4), I can move up to (4,5) as before, but (4,6) is obstacle, so I need to go around.\n\nFrom (4,4), move left to (3,4)\n\nTurn 18: from (4,4) move left to (3,4), positions: head (3,4), then (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)] etc., but let's not detail.\n\nThen from (3,4) move up to (3,5), but (3,5) might be occupied or not.\n\nAt turn 16, snake tail at (2,5), so after moves, it changes.\n\nPerhaps it's possible to reach (1,6) faster.\n\nShortest path from (6,4) to (1,6): delta x=5, delta y=2, so at least 7 moves, but with body, it might take more turns.\n\nFor example, move left 5 times, up 2 times, but need to sequence.\n\nBut snake body might block.\n\nAt turn 16, positions: head (6,4), body (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nSo the row y=5 has body from x=2 to 6, so to go up, I need to go to y=4 or y=6.\n\nFrom (6,4), if I go left to (5,4), then (4,4), etc., then from (1,4) up to (1,5), (1,6).\n\nFrom (6,4) to (1,4) is 5 left moves, then 2 up to (1,6), so 7 moves.\n\nTurn 16: start at (6,4)\n\nTurn 16 move left to (5,4)\n\nTurn 17 move left to (4,4)\n\nTurn 18 move left to (3,4)\n\nTurn 19 move left to (2,4)\n\nTurn 20 move left to (1,4)\n\nThen turn 21 move up to (1,5)\n\nTurn 22 move up to (1,6) eat food.\n\nLife span of (1,6) is 10, at turn 16, so on turn 22 it is present, since turns 16 to 25, so yes, can eat on turn 22.\n\nThen after that, I can go for (6,1), which has life span 7, at turn 16, present until turn 22, so on turn 22, when I eat (1,6), (6,1) is still present, but I am at (1,6), and (6,1) is far.\n\nFrom (1,6) to (6,1), delta x=5, delta y=5, so at least 10 moves, but (6,1) disappears after turn 22, so on turn 23 it is gone. Turn 22 is the last turn it is present, since life span 7, present on 16 to 22, gone on 23.\n\nSo if I eat (1,6) on turn 22, I am at (1,6), and (6,1) is gone on turn 23, so I can't eat it.\n\nIf I go for (6,1) first, I can eat it on turn 18, but then I can't reach (1,6) by turn 25 if I go directly, but earlier I saw that from south, I can reach (1,6) by turn 25 if I start early, but in the first path, I was at (6,6) on turn 25, not (1,6).\n\nIn the left path, if I go directly to (1,6), I eat on turn 22, but miss (6,1).\n\nSo I can only eat one food, not both, because of the distance and time.\n\n(6,1) last chance turn 22, (1,6) last chance turn 25.\n\nFrom turn 16 to 22, 6 turns, from (6,4) to (6,1) is 3 moves down, so I can eat on turn 18, then from there to (1,6) is far, as before.\n\nMinimum moves from (6,1) to (1,6): 5 left, 5 up, but with obstacles, at least 10 moves, so 10 turns, from turn 19 to turn 28, but turn 25 is last for (1,6), so turn 19 to 28 is too late, turn 19 + 10 = turn 29, way after turn 25.\n\nTurn 18 at (6,1), turn 19 at say (5,1), etc., to reach (1,6) by turn 25, I need to be there on or before turn 25.\n\nFrom turn 18 to 25, 7 turns, from (6,1) to (1,6), Manhattan distance 5+5=10, which is more than 7, so impossible to reach in 7 moves with the snake body, since I have to go around or something, but Manhattan is 10, so at least 10 moves, so cannot reach by turn 25 from turn 18.\n\nSimilarly, from turn 16 to (1,6) in 6 turns to turn 22, Manhattan from (6,4) to (1,6) is 5+2=7, which is less than or equal to 6? 7 moves, from turn 16 to 22 is 6 moves? Turns: turn 16 start, move on turn 16 to new position, so after k moves, at turn 16+k.\n\nTo be at (1,6) on turn 22, I need to arrive on turn 22.\n\nFrom turn 16 to turn 22, I can make 6 moves (turn 16,17,18,19,20,21) to be at (1,6) on turn 22? After 6 moves, at turn 22.\n\nBut distance is 7, so I need 7 moves, so after 7 moves at turn 23, but turn 23 is after turn 22, and (1,6) present until turn 22, so on turn 22 I can eat it if I move to it.\n\nBut with 6 moves from turn 16 to 21, I can be at (1,6) on turn 22 if I move to it on turn 22.\n\nTurn 16: move 1\n\nTurn 17: move 2\n\n...\n\nTurn 21: move 6\n\nTurn 22: move 7 to (1,6)\n\nOn turn 22, I move to (1,6) and eat it.\n\nSimilarly, for (6,1), on turn 22 I can eat it if I move to it.\n\nBut I can't be at both.\n\nSo for (1,6), from (6,4), I can reach in 7 moves: for example, left 5 times to (1,4), then up 2 times to (1,6), but on the way, at (1,4) on turn 21, then turn 22 move up to (1,5)? To (1,6) on turn 22.\n\nFrom (6,4) to (1,4) is 5 left moves, 5 steps.\n\nTurn 16: move left to (5,4)\n\nTurn 17: move left to (4,4)\n\nTurn 18: move left to (3,4)\n\nTurn 19: move left to (2,4)\n\nTurn 20: move left to (1,4)\n\nThen turn 21: move up to (1,5)\n\nTurn 22: move up to (1,6) eat.\n\nYes, 7 moves, on turn 22 eat.\n\nSimilarly, for (6,1), from (6,4) to (6,1) is 3 down moves, can eat on turn 18.\n\nBut since I can only eat one, I should choose the one with higher priority or better position.\n\nBut both have value 1, same.\n\nBut after eating, the position might be better for survival.\n\nIf I eat (6,1) first, I am at bottom, which might be riskier.\n\nIf I eat (1,6) first, I am at top-left.\n\nBut with the obstacle at (4,6), the top row has a gap.\n\nAlso, for long-term survival, I need to avoid boxing myself in.\n\nNow, back to current turn, I have to choose between down or left.\n\nIf I go down, I commit to eating (6,1) soon.\n\nIf I go left, I can head towards (1,6).\n\nBut since I can only eat one, I should consider which one is safer or has better access to other areas.\n\nBut there are only two foods, and after eating one, I need to survive, but score is from eating food, so to maximize score, I should eat both if possible, but it seems impossible with the time and distance.\n\nUnless I can eat one and then the other quickly, but as calculated, not possible.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (6,1) and then not go for (1,6), but there might be more food later, but the state only shows current food, and I think new food may spawn, but the problem doesn't specify food spawning, so I think only these two are present for now.\n\nThe food may disappear or be eaten, and new ones may spawn, but the rules don't say. In the input, only these two are given, so I think for this decision, only these matter.\n\nBut to maximize score, eating both is better, but impossible, so I should eat one.\n\nSince both same value, I can choose either.\n\nBut let's see which one is easier to eat with less risk.\n\n(6,1) is closer, so I can eat it in 3 moves, then I have a longer snake, but I can survive longer.\n\nIf I go for (1,6), it takes 7 moves, and during that time, I might have risks.\n\nAt current position, going left to (5,4) might be safer than going down to (6,3), because at (6,3), I am closer to the bottom wall, and after eating, I have to turn left or right immediately.\n\nWhereas going left, I am more central.\n\nAlso, the food at (6,1) has shorter life, but I can still eat it later if I don't go now, but with life span 7, I have until turn 22, so I can delay.\n\nFor example, at turn 16, I can move left to (5,4), then from there, I can still go down later to (5,3), etc. to (6,1), but it might take more turns.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can go down to (5,3), then (5,2), (5,1), then right to (6,1), but from (5,1) to (6,1) might be occupied or not.\n\nBut let's not complicate.\n\nSince the AI must think 5+ turns ahead, I should plan a sequence.\n\nAlso, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the format is to output for turns starting from t1, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output for a sequence, but the number of turns to output is not specified.\n\nLook at the answer format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ... }\n\nBut it doesn't say how many turns. I think I need to output for the immediate turns, perhaps for 5 turns or so.\n\nBut in the context, I should decide the first move, and think ahead for planning.\n\nBut for the output, I need to provide a sequence.\n\nPerhaps for this response, I provide actions for the next few turns, say 5 turns.\n\nBut let's see the core rules: \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but for output, it's a sequence.\n\nI think for this, I should output the action for turn 16, and perhaps for a few more, but it's open.\n\nTo be safe, I'll plan the first move and think ahead.\n\nBut let's make a decision.\n\nAnother thing: the tail reward danger. In this case, no food under snake, so no issue.\n\nAlso, for (6,1), when I eat it, tail is far, no problem.\n\nSimilarly for (1,6).\n\nSo no immediate danger.\n\nNow, let's consider the move left option.\n\nIf I move left to (5,4) at turn 16.\n\nThen from there, I can go down to (5,3) or left to (4,4).\n\nIf I go down to (5,3), I can then go to (5,2), (5,1), then to (6,1) if possible.\n\nBut at (5,1), (6,1) might be free.\n\nTurn 16: move left to (5,4)\n\nPositions: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] tail at (3,5)\n\nTurn 17: move down to (5,3)  (since from (5,4) down to (5,3))\n\nHead direction Down.\n\nPositions: head (5,3), then (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)] tail at (4,5) (tail removed)\n\nTurn 18: move down to (5,2), positions: head (5,2), then (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)] tail at (5,5)\n\nTurn 19: move down to (5,1), positions: head (5,1), then (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)] tail at (6,5)\n\nNow at (5,1), I can move right to (6,1) to eat the food, if (6,1) is still there.\n\nTurn 20: move right to (6,1), but (6,1) is food, so eat it.\n\nDirection from (5,1) to (6,1) is right, so direction Right.\n\nPositions: head (6,1), then (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)] and since ate, no tail removal, new segment, so positions: head (6,1), then (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) — tail at (6,5)\n\nLength 7.\n\nAnd (6,1) is eaten on turn 20, which is before turn 22, so ok.\n\nThen from there, I can go up or left.\n\nBut I missed (1,6) because I was going down.\n\nBut (1,6) is still there until turn 25, so from (6,1), I can try to go to (1,6), but as before, Manhattan distance 10, from turn 21 to turn 25, 5 turns, not enough.\n\nTurn 20 at (6,1), turn 21 move to say (6,2) or (5,1), but (5,1) is body, etc., not possible to reach (1,6) in 5 moves.\n\nSo still can't eat both.\n\nTherefore, I should choose one to eat.\n\nSince (6,1) is closer, I can eat it sooner and have more time to survive or eat other food that may spawn.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) is farther, so eating it later might be riskier with the snake body.\n\nAlso, after eating (6,1), I am near the bottom, which might be constraining.\n\nBut with the move left first, I can eat (6,1) on turn 20, which is later than going directly, but I am not committed early.\n\nAt turn 16, moving left to (5,4) keeps my options open, as I can still go down to eat (6,1) or go left to eat (1,6).\n\nFrom (5,4), I can go down to (5,3) as above to eat (6,1) around turn 20, or I can go left to (4,4) then to (3,4), etc. to eat (1,6) on turn 22.\n\nBut if I go for (1,6), I eat on turn 22, and (6,1) disappears on turn 22, so I can't eat it.\n\nIf I go for (6,1) from (5,4), I eat on turn 20, and (1,6) I can try to reach but can't.\n\nSo in both cases, I eat one food.\n\nNow for survival, after eating, I need to have space to move.\n\nIf I eat (6,1), I am at bottom with a long snake, which might make it hard to manuever.\n\nIf I eat (1,6), I am at top-left, with obstacle, might be similar.\n\nBut the grid has more space on the left or bottom.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid the bottom because of the wall.\n\nAlso, the head direction.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 16, move down to (6,3), then on turn 17, instead of going down to (6,2), I could go left or right to avoid going to the corner immediately.\n\nFor example, from (6,3), I can move left to (5,3) or right, but right to (7,3) wall, so left to (5,3).\n\nThen from there, I can go down to (5,2), etc. to (5,1), then to (6,1) if I want.\n\nBut similar to before.\n\nBut let's decide on the first move.\n\nSince the AI should prioritize long-term survival, and eating food, I think moving left to (5,4) is better because it keeps me away from the wall and gives more options.\n\nFor example, from (5,4), I can go to (4,4), then to (3,4), etc., and the body is behind, so the path might be clearer.\n\nWhereas going down to (6,3), I am closer to wall.\n\nAlso, the food at (6,1) can be eaten later if I choose, from a different path.\n\nBut with life span, I have time.\n\nSo I think for turn 16, move Left to (5,4).\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I can decide.\n\nBut for the output, I need to provide a sequence.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns: turns 16 to 20 or something.\n\nBut let's plan a sequence.\n\nTurn 16: move Left to (5,4)\n\nThen from (5,4), I can move Down to (5,3) to head towards (6,1), or Left to (4,4) to head towards (1,6).\n\nSince (6,1) has shorter life, I should eat it first, but I can do it from here.\n\nTurn 17: move Down to (5,3)\n\nTurn 18: move Down to (5,2)\n\nTurn 19: move Down to (5,1)\n\nTurn 20: move Right to (6,1) to eat it.\n\nBut on turn 20, (6,1) is still there, life span 7 from turn 16, on turn 20, life span 4? At turn 16, life span 7, after turn 16, life span 6 on turn 17, 5 on 18, 4 on 19, 3 on 20, so on turn 20 it is present, can be eaten.\n\nThen after that, I have the snake longer, and I can move to other areas.\n\nFor the other food, I might not reach it, but I can survive.\n\nSo this seems a plan.\n\nIf I want to go for (1,6), but it takes longer and I miss (6,1).\n\nSo better to eat the closer one.\n\nWith this, I eat on turn 20.\n\nBut if I go directly down from turn 16, I eat on turn 18, earlier, so I get the score sooner, and the snake is longer, but I might be in a tighter spot.\n\nWith the indirect path, I eat later, but I have more space.\n\nIn terms of score, same value, so no difference.\n\nFor survival, after eating at (6,1), I am at (6,1) with snake positions, and I can move left or up as before.\n\nWith the indirect path, when I eat at (6,1), I am coming from left, so the body is different.\n\nIn the direct path, body is stacked to the right, in indirect, body is to the left and up.\n\nBut not sure which is better.\n\nI think moving left first is safer.\n\nAlso, the initial move left avoids the potential risk at bottom.\n\nSo I'll go with move Left on turn 16.\n\nThen for the sequence, let's output for 5 turns: 16 to 20.\n\nTurn 16: L\n\nTurn 17: D\n\nTurn 18: D\n\nTurn 19: D\n\nTurn 20: R to eat (6,1)\n\nBut on turn 20, moving to (6,1), and (6,1) is food.\n\nIn the positions, when I move to (5,1) on turn 19, from (5,2) or where.\n\nFrom turn 16: move L to (5,4)\n\nPositions: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] tail (3,5)\n\nTurn 17: move D to (5,3), head down, positions: [(5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)] tail (4,5)\n\nTurn 18: move D to (5,2), positions: [(5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)] tail (5,5)\n\nTurn 19: move D to (5,1), positions: [(5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)] tail (6,5)\n\nTurn 20: move R to (6,1), eat food, positions: [(6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)] tail (6,5) but since ate, tail stays, so positions with head (6,1), then (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) — tail at (6,5)\n\nNow, from here, I can move up or left, etc.\n\nBut for the output, I think this is fine.\n\nSince the food at (1,6) is not eaten, but I can't reach it, so no issue.\n\nFor long-term, after this, I can move up to (6,2) or left to (5,1) but (5,1) is body, so only up to (6,2) or down but down wall, or right wall, so only up.\n\nTurn 21 move U to (6,2), and so on.\n\nBut I think for the response, I can provide turns 16 to 20 actions.\n\nThe answer format should be in the box.\n\nAlso, the head direction for each turn, but I think the action implies the direction.\n\nSo for turn 16: L\n\nTurn 17: D\n\nTurn 18: D\n\nTurn 19: D\n\nTurn 20: R\n\nBut on turn 20, moving to (6,1), which is food.\n\nIn the sequence, I have 5 actions.\n\nPerhaps I should include the food eating, but it's fine.\n\nSince thinking 5 turns ahead, this should be ok.\n\nBut at turn 16, moving left, then down, etc., I avoid the immediate corner.\n\nSo I think it's a good plan.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, the AI must prioritize eating available positive food while avoiding collisions with walls, obstacles, and the snake's body. The current state at turn 16 is analyzed below, with a focus on the next 5 turns (turns 16 to 20) to align with the \"think 5+ turns ahead\" requirement. The plan involves eating the positive food at (6,1) safely, as it has a shorter lifespan (disappears after turn 22) and is closer, allowing for earlier score gain. Moving left initially avoids the bottom wall and provides more maneuvering space, reducing risk compared to heading directly downward. The food at (1,6) has a longer lifespan (disappears after turn 25) but is too distant to reach after eating (6,1) within the time constraints, so it is not targeted in this sequence.\n\n### Key Considerations for the Plan:\n- **Current Snake State**: Head at (6,4), direction Down. Body segments: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5). Tail at (2,5).\n- **Movement Constraints**: \n  - No instant reverse: From direction Down, cannot move Up next.\n  - Valid moves from (6,4): Down to (6,3) or Left to (5,4). Right to (7,4) is a wall, and Up to (6,5) causes body collision.\n- **Food Analysis**:\n  - (6,1): Value +1, lifespan 7 (present until turn 22). Eating it requires 3 down moves from (6,4) but risks cornering the snake near the bottom wall.\n  - (1,6): Value +1, lifespan 10 (present until turn 25). Too far to reach from (6,4) in time if (6,1) is eaten first (Manhattan distance 10 moves, only 7 turns available from turn 18 to 25).\n- **Risks**:\n  - Bottom proximity: Moving directly down risks trapping the snake after eating (6,1), with limited escape routes.\n  - Body and obstacle avoidance: Internal obstacle at (4,6) and body segments must be navigated around.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: Moving left first (to (5,4)) keeps options open, avoids walls, and allows a safer path to (6,1) by approaching from the left. After eating, the snake can navigate upward for more space.\n\n### Turn-by-Turn Plan (Turns 16-20):\nThe sequence below eats the food at (6,1) on turn 20 while minimizing risk. Actions are chosen to:\n- Avoid walls and body collisions.\n- Ensure the head direction allows valid moves (no instant reverse).\n- Position the snake for survival after eating.\n\n- **Turn 16 (current)**: Move Left (L) to (5,4).  \n  - Reason: Avoids the bottom wall and body collision risks. From (6,4), Left is safe and opens paths to both foods. Direction changes to Left.  \n  - New state: Head at (5,4), direction Left. Positions: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]. Tail at (3,5). Food unchanged.\n\n- **Turn 17**: Move Down (D) to (5,3).  \n  - Reason: Continues toward (6,1) safely. Down is valid (no opposite move; direction is Left). (5,3) is empty. Direction changes to Down.  \n  - New state: Head at (5,3), direction Down. Positions: [(5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)]. Tail at (4,5). Food unchanged.\n\n- **Turn 18**: Move Down (D) to (5,2).  \n  - Reason: Progresses toward (6,1). Down is valid (direction Down). (5,2) is empty. Direction remains Down.  \n  - New state: Head at (5,2), direction Down. Positions: [(5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)]. Tail at (5,5). Food unchanged.\n\n- **Turn 19**: Move Down (D) to (5,1).  \n  - Reason: Positions head to eat (6,1) next turn. Down is valid (direction Down). (5,1) is empty. Direction remains Down.  \n  - New state: Head at (5,1), direction Down. Positions: [(5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)]. Tail at (6,5). Food unchanged; (6,1) lifespan now 3 (at turn 19).\n\n- **Turn 20**: Move Right (R) to (6,1) and eat food (+1 score, length increases to 7).  \n  - Reason: Eats (6,1) before it disappears (lifespan 2 after this turn). Right is valid (no opposite move; direction Down). (6,1) is accessible and not under tail (no Tail Reward Danger). Direction changes to Right.  \n  - New state: Head at (6,1), direction Right. Positions: [(6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)]. Tail at (6,5). Food: (6,1) eaten; only (1,6) remains with lifespan 6.\n\n### Why This Plan?\n- **Score Maximization**: Eats (6,1) on turn 20, gaining +1 score efficiently. (1,6) is not reachable in time but has low priority due to distance and no benefit over (6,1).\n- **Risk Avoidance**: \n  - Left move on turn 16 avoids bottom wall proximity and body risks.\n  - Path to (6,1) is safe, with no collisions predicted.\n  - After eating, the snake can move Up (e.g., to (6,2)) to access open areas for survival.\n- **5+ Turns Ahead**: The sequence positions the snake centrally after eating, allowing future moves toward open cells (e.g., up or left) to avoid dead ends. (1,6) is ignored as it would require 10+ moves from (6,1), exceeding its lifespan.\n- **Efficiency**: Eating on turn 20 uses the food lifespan fully and avoids rushing.\n\n### Output:\n\\boxed{\nTurn 16: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 17: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 18: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 19: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 20: R (right)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 17, and I'm playing Snake on a grid with walls and obstacles. The grid size isn't specified, but from the walls, it seems like x from 0 to 7 and y from 0 to 7, so it's an 8x8 grid. Walls are at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There's also an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: head at (5,4), then body segments at (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5). So the snake has 6 segments. Head direction is left (L), which means it was moving left last turn.\n\nFood: There are two food items:\n\n- One at (6,1) with life span 6 and value +1 (positive food)\n\n- Another at (1,6) with life span 9 and value +1 (also positive food)\n\nBoth are positive, so eating them increases length by 1. No negative food here.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid. I'll sketch a grid from (0,0) to (7,7).\n\n- Walls: borders, so cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also, internal obstacle at (4,6), so (4,6) is blocked.\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- Head: (5,4)\n\n- Body: (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)\n\nSo, let's list the snake cells:\n\n- (5,4): head\n\n- (6,4): segment 1\n\n- (6,5): segment 2\n\n- (5,5): segment 3\n\n- (4,5): segment 4\n\n- (3,5): segment 5? Wait, positions are given as list, so index 0 is head, index 1 to 5 are body, so 6 segments total.\n\nTail is at (3,5).\n\nHead direction is L, so last move was left to (5,4) from... since it was moving left, previous head was at (6,4), but (6,4) is now the first body segment. Snake positions: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nSo, from turn 16 to 17, head moved from (6,4) to (5,4), left.\n\nNow, current possible moves: since head is at (5,4), and direction is L, but I can move U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse. Current head direction is L, so I cannot move right (opposite) on this turn. So possible moves: U, D, L (since L is not opposite? Current direction is L, opposite is R, so I can move U, D, or L, but not R.\n\nNo instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is the direction the head is facing, which is L, so for turn 17, I cannot move R.\n\nSo possible actions: U, D, L.\n\nNow, let's see what each move does:\n\n- U: (x,y+1) = (5,5)\n\n- D: (x,y-1) = (5,3)\n\n- L: (x-1,y) = (4,4)\n\nNow, check for collisions:\n\nFirst, U to (5,5): what is at (5,5)? From snake positions, (5,5) is a body segment, index 3. But is it safe? The rule is: body collision if head touches any body segment, except that you can move into the tail cell if the tail moves away.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (3,5). If I move to (5,5), that is occupied by a body segment, not the tail. So it would be a collision and death, unless that segment moves away.\n\nWhen I move, the snake moves: head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and tail moves away.\n\nSo, if I move to a cell that is currently occupied, but if it's the tail, it might be safe because the tail moves.\n\nBut in this case, (5,5) is not the tail; it's the third segment. Let's list positions after move.\n\nAssume I move to (5,5) at turn 17.\n\nCurrent positions: head (5,4), body: (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)\n\nAfter move U to (5,5):\n\n- New head: (5,5)\n\n- Then body segments: the first body segment moves to where head was, (5,4)\n\n- Second segment moves to where first was, (6,4)\n\n- Third segment moves to where second was, (6,5)\n\n- Fourth segment moves to where third was, (5,5) — but (5,5) is where the head is moving to, and it's currently occupied by the fourth segment? Positions:\n\nIndex: 0: (5,4) head\n\n1: (6,4)\n\n2: (6,5)\n\n3: (5,5)\n\n4: (4,5)\n\n5: (3,5) tail\n\nAfter moving head to (5,5):\n\n- New head: (5,5)\n\n- New segment 1: (5,4)  // old head\n\n- New segment 2: (6,4)  // old seg1\n\n- New segment 3: (6,5)  // old seg2\n\n- New segment 4: (5,5)  // old seg3? But (5,5) is the new head position.\n\nConflict: old seg3 is at (5,5), and head is moving to (5,5). So before the move, (5,5) is occupied by seg3. When head moves to (5,5), at the same time, seg3 should move to where seg2 was, which is (6,5), but (6,5) is occupied by seg2, which will move to where seg1 was, and so on.\n\nThe key point is that when the head moves to a cell, if that cell is currently occupied by a body segment, it's only safe if that segment is the tail and it moves away. Otherwise, if it's a non-tail segment, it will still be there or move to a different cell, but since the head is moving to a cell that will be vacated or not?\n\nStandard snake movement: all segments move simultaneously.\n\nAt turn t, positions: P0 (head), P1, P2, ..., Pk (tail)\n\nAt turn t+1, head moves to new position N, then P1 moves to P0, P2 to P1, ..., Pk to P_{k-1}, so the tail Pk leaves its cell.\n\nTherefore, if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by Pi, for i not tail, then after move, that cell will have the head and Pi will move to the next position, but since Pi is moving away, the cell is only occupied by one at a time? No, at the moment of move, the head occupies N, and Pi moves to P_{i-1}, which is different.\n\nBut the collision is if the head moves to a cell that is part of the body at that time, except if it's the tail cell.\n\nIn this case, for U to (5,5): currently, (5,5) is occupied by seg3. After move, head is at (5,5), but seg3 moves to where seg2 was, which is (6,5), so (5,5) is no longer occupied by seg3; it's now occupied by head, and seg3 is at (6,5). So no collision because the body segment moved away before the head arrives? No, the movement is simultaneous.\n\nI think I need to think carefully.\n\nTypically in snake games, if the head moves into a cell that is occupied by a body segment at the start of the turn, it collides, unless that segment is the tail and the tail moves away, meaning the head is moving to the tail position and the tail leaves, so it's safe.\n\nBut if it's a body segment that is not the tail, it will move, but the head is moving to that cell, so at the new time, the cell has the head, and that body segment is elsewhere, so it should be safe as long as no other collision.\n\nBut the rule says: \"body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nIt implies that moving into a non-tail body segment is deadly.\n\nLet me read: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, moving into any body segment except the tail is collision and death. Only moving into the tail cell is safe if the tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, for (5,5), it is currently occupied by segment 3, which is not the tail (tail is segment 5 at (3,5)), so moving to (5,5) would cause collision with body segment, so death. Therefore, U to (5,5) is invalid and deadly.\n\nSimilarly, let's check other moves.\n\nFirst, possible moves from (5,4):\n\n- U: (5,5) - currently occupied by snake body (seg3), not tail, so collision.\n\n- D: (5,3) - what is here? Not in snake positions, and not wall? Walls: y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=3 is not wall, x=5 not border. Also, not obstacle. So (5,3) should be empty.\n\n- L: (4,4) - not in snake positions, not wall, not obstacle, so empty.\n\n- R: (6,4) - but (6,4) is currently occupied by snake body seg1. Is it tail? Tail is (3,5), so (6,4) is not tail, so moving to (6,4) would be collision. Also, R is opposite to current direction L, so not allowed anyway.\n\nSo only possible safe moves: D to (5,3) or L to (4,4).\n\nNow, D to (5,3): (5,3) is empty, so safe.\n\nL to (4,4): (4,4) is empty, safe.\n\nI need to think ahead multiple turns.\n\nAlso, there is food to consider. Food at (6,1) with life span 6, and (1,6) with life span 9.\n\nCurrent turn is 17, so food at (6,1) disappears after 6 turns, meaning on turn 17+6=23 it disappears, but life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 17, life span 6, so it will disappear after 6 more turns, i.e., at the start of turn 23 or something? Let's see.\n\n\"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo, at turn 17, life span is 6, so after 6 turns, it will be gone. After turn 17, countdown to 5; after turn 18, to 4; ... after turn 22, to 0; so at turn 23, it should be gone. Similarly for the other food, life span 9 at turn 17, so it will last until turn 17+9-1? Let's clarify.\n\nTypically, if countdown decreases every turn including current, at turn t, life span L, then:\n\n- After turn t, L becomes L-1\n\n- After turn t+1, L-2, ..., after turn t + (L-1), L - L = 0, so it disappears before or at turn t + L.\n\nThe rule says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nI think it's safer to assume that at the end of turn t, life span decreases, so at start of turn t, life span is L, after the turn, it decreases to L-1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nBut for movement, when you move onto a cell with food, you eat it at that turn.\n\nIn this case, for food at (6,1), at turn 17, life span 6. After turn 17, it decreases to 5, so it can be eaten until turn 22 (since after turn 22, it would decrease to 0 and disappear).\n\nSimilarly, food at (1,6) life span 9, can be eaten until turn 25.\n\nNow, back to immediate move. I have two choices: move D to (5,3) or L to (4,4).\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's consider the grid state.\n\nSnake positions: (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)\n\nAfter move, if I go D to (5,3):\n\n- New head: (5,3)\n\n- New body: (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)  // tail was (3,5), now new tail is (4,5)? Positions:\n\nAfter move: head to (5,3)\n\nThen body segments: seg1 to old head (5,4), seg2 to old seg1 (6,4), seg3 to old seg2 (6,5), seg4 to old seg3 (5,5), seg5 to old seg4 (4,5). Old seg4 was (4,5), so new seg5 (tail) at (4,5). Old tail (3,5) is gone.\n\nSo new positions: head (5,3), then (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nTail at (4,5).\n\nIf I go L to (4,4):\n\n- Head to (4,4)\n\n- Body: seg1 to (5,4), seg2 to (6,4), seg3 to (6,5), seg4 to (5,5), seg5 to (4,5) // old seg4 was (4,5)? Old positions: seg4 is (4,5), so new seg5 to (4,5), but that's the same cell? No:\n\nAfter move: head to (4,4)\n\nseg1 to old head (5,4)\n\nseg2 to old seg1 (6,4)\n\nseg3 to old seg2 (6,5)\n\nseg4 to old seg3 (5,5)\n\nseg5 to old seg4 (4,5)  // so tail at (4,5)\n\nBut (4,5) was occupied, but it's the tail, and it moves to (4,5), but since head is moving to (4,4), no issue.\n\nNow, food locations: (6,1) and (1,6)\n\n(6,1) is at bottom, x=6,y=1\n\n(1,6) is at left, x=1,y=6\n\nSnake is around (5,4), so (6,1) is not far, but y=1, snake at y=4, so 3 steps down, but with obstacles.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) is farther.\n\nAlso, internal obstacle at (4,6), which is near (4,5) and (5,5), etc.\n\nI need to plan a path to eat food while avoiding dead ends.\n\nSince I need to think ahead, let's consider possible paths.\n\nFirst, if I move D to (5,3), I go down to y=3, which is closer to the food at (6,1), since y=1.\n\nFrom (5,3), I can then move to (5,2), (5,1), but (5,1) is not (6,1), so I need to go right or something.\n\nLet's list possible moves from (5,3):\n\nAfter moving to (5,3), head at (5,3), direction was D, so next turn I can move L, R, D, but not U (opposite).\n\nFrom (5,3), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (5,4) — but (5,4) will be occupied by body? After move to (5,3), positions: head (5,3), body (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nSo (5,4) is occupied by seg1, not tail, so moving U to (5,4) would collide with body.\n\n- D: to (5,2) — empty, probably.\n\n- L: to (4,3) — empty\n\n- R: to (6,3) — empty? x=6, y=3, not wall, not obstacle, not in snake, so empty.\n\nBut R is allowed since current direction is D, not opposite.\n\nNow, if I go to (5,2), then from there, etc.\n\nBut I want to reach (6,1).\n\nFrom (5,3), I can go D to (5,2), then D to (5,1), but (5,1) is at y=1, which is not a wall, y=0 is wall, so y=1 is fine. But food is at (6,1), not (5,1). So from (5,1), I need to go R to (6,1).\n\nSimilarly, from (5,3), I can go R to (6,3), then D to (6,2), then D to (6,1).\n\nBut let's see the body positions.\n\nAlso, there might be risks.\n\nFirst, let's consider the other option: moving L to (4,4) at turn 17.\n\nAfter moving to (4,4), positions: head (4,4), body (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nTail at (4,5).\n\nNow, from (4,4), direction was L, so next turn I can move U, D, L, not R (opposite).\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: to (4,5) — (4,5) is occupied by tail. Since it's tail, and tail will move, it might be safe.\n\n(4,5) is current tail, and after move, tail moves to where? When head moves to new position, tail moves to old seg4 position.\n\nCurrent positions before move: head (4,4), body seg1 (5,4), seg2 (6,4), seg3 (6,5), seg4 (5,5), tail seg5 (4,5)\n\nIf head moves to (4,5):\n\n- New head: (4,5)\n\n- Then seg1 moves to old head (4,4)\n\n- seg2 moves to old seg1 (5,4)\n\n- seg3 moves to old seg2 (6,4)\n\n- seg4 moves to old seg3 (6,5)\n\n- seg5 moves to old seg4 (5,5)\n\nSo new tail at (5,5)\n\nNow, (4,5) was the tail, and head moves there, but tail moves to (5,5), so no collision, it should be safe.\n\nMoreover, if there is food at (4,5), but there isn't, so just moving.\n\nAfter move, head at (4,5), body: (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)\n\nTail at (5,5).\n\nNow, from (4,4), other moves:\n\n- D: to (4,3) — empty\n\n- L: to (3,4) — empty? x=3,y=4, not wall, not obstacle, not snake, so empty.\n\n- R: to (5,4) — but (5,4) is occupied by seg1, not tail, so collision, and also R is opposite to current L, not allowed.\n\nSo from (4,4), possible moves: U to (4,5), D to (4,3), L to (3,4)\n\nU to (4,5) is safe as we saw.\n\nNow, back to the food. I need to eat food to score.\n\nFood at (6,1) is closer in terms of turns, but life span 6, so I have until turn 22 to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) life span 9, until turn 25.\n\nBut snake is at (5,4), (6,1) is at (6,1), which is 3 steps away if I go directly, but with body, I might not go directly.\n\nFrom head (5,4) to (6,1): delta x +1, delta y -3, so min 4 moves, but since I need to path around.\n\nBut I can't go directly because of walls or body.\n\nFirst, let's see if moving D to (5,3) helps to go to (6,1).\n\nFrom (5,3), I can go D to (5,2), then D to (5,1), then R to (6,1). That's 3 moves from (5,3), but I need to get to (5,3) first.\n\nFrom turn 17: if I move D to (5,3) on turn 17.\n\nTurn 18: from (5,3), I can move D to (5,2) (since direction D, can move D, L, R, not U)\n\nTurn 19: from (5,2), move D to (5,1) (direction D, can move D, L, R)\n\nTurn 20: from (5,1), move R to (6,1) to eat food. Direction was D, R is not opposite, so ok.\n\nAt turn 20, move to (6,1), which has food, so eat it, length increases.\n\nBut is (6,1) safe? When I move to (6,1), what is the body?\n\nLet's simulate the positions.\n\nStart turn 17: positions: head (5,4), body (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)\n\nMove D to (5,3) on turn 17.\n\nAfter turn 17: head (5,3), body (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)  // tail at (4,5)\n\nTurn 18: move D to (5,2)\n\nNew head (5,2), body (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)  // tail at (5,5)\n\nTurn 19: move D to (5,1)\n\nNew head (5,1), body (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)  // tail at (6,5)\n\nTurn 20: move R to (6,1)\n\nNew head (6,1), body (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)  // after move, seg1 to (5,1)? Old head was (5,1), so new seg1 to (5,1), but head is moving to (6,1), so positions: head (6,1), seg1 to old head (5,1), seg2 to old seg1 (5,2), seg3 to old seg2 (5,3), seg4 to old seg3 (5,4), seg5 to old seg4 (6,4)\n\nOld seg4 was (6,4), so new seg5 at (6,4)\n\nNow, (6,1) was empty, I assume, and food is there, so eat it, snake grows to 7 segments. Since I ate food, the tail doesn't move, so new tail is added.\n\nWhen you eat food, the length increases, so the tail stays in place, and a new segment is added.\n\nStandard: when you move to a food cell, you eat it, so the snake grows; the head moves to the food cell, and the tail does not move, so a new segment is added at the tail position.\n\nIn terms of positions: when head moves to food cell, the body segments move as usual, but the tail position remains, and a new segment is added there, so length increases by one.\n\nIn this case, at turn 20, head moves to (6,1) which has food, so after move:\n\n- Head at (6,1)\n\n- Body: seg1 at old head (5,1)\n\n- seg2 at old seg1 (5,2)\n\n- seg3 at old seg2 (5,3)\n\n- seg4 at old seg3 (5,4)\n\n- seg5 at old seg4 (6,4)\n\nAnd since food eaten, tail does not move, so the last position remains, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position. But the previous tail was old seg4 at (6,4), which is now seg5.\n\nAfter movement, the positions are: head at new position, then each body segment to previous position, but when food eaten, the tail doesn't advance, so the last position is kept, meaning the new tail is at the old tail position.\n\nBefore move, positions: head (5,1), body (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), tail (6,5)? From above, before turn 20 move: head at (5,1), body: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)? Let's list turn 19 positions.\n\nAfter turn 19: head (5,1), body (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)  // seg1 (5,2), seg2 (5,3), seg3 (5,4), seg4 (6,4), seg5 (6,5) tail.\n\nTurn 20: move head to (6,1)\n\nSince (6,1) has food, eat it, so snake grows.\n\nNew positions:\n\n- Head: (6,1)\n\n- Then, the body segments: the first segment moves to old head (5,1)\n\n- Second segment moves to old seg1 (5,2)\n\n- Third segment moves to old seg2 (5,3)\n\n- Fourth segment moves to old seg3 (5,4)\n\n- Fifth segment moves to old seg4 (6,4)\n\n- And since food eaten, a new segment is added at the old tail position, so new sixth segment at (6,5)\n\nSo new positions: head (6,1), then (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nLength 7 now.\n\nAnd (6,5) is the new tail.\n\nOk, that seems fine.\n\nBut is there any risk? At turn 20, moving to (6,1), which is not occupied, so safe.\n\nNow, back to turn 17, if I choose this path, I eat food at turn 20.\n\nBut life span of that food: at turn 17, life span 6, after turn 17, to 5; turn 18, to 4; turn 19, to 3; turn 20, to 2, so at turn 20, it is still there, I eat it, good.\n\nNow, what about the other food at (1,6)? I can plan to eat that later.\n\nBut I need to survive and eat more.\n\nNow, the other choice at turn 17 is to move L to (4,4).\n\nIf I do that, then from (4,4), I can go to (4,5) or other places.\n\n(4,5) is the tail, so moving U to (4,5) is safe, as we saw.\n\nThen from there, I might go towards (1,6).\n\nBut (1,6) is farther, and I have time.\n\nAlso, there is an internal obstacle at (4,6), which is above (4,5).\n\nLet's see if moving L at turn 17 is better for long-term.\n\nFirst, move L to (4,4) on turn 17.\n\nAfter: head (4,4), body (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nNow turn 18: from (4,4), I can move U to (4,5), which is current tail.\n\nMove U to (4,5): as before, it's safe.\n\nAfter move: head (4,5), body (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)\n\nNow, from (4,5), direction U (since I moved up), so next turn I can move U, L, R, not D (opposite).\n\nPossible moves from (4,5):\n\n- U: to (4,6) — but (4,6) is an internal obstacle! Wall at (4,6), so cannot move there.\n\n- L: to (3,5) — (3,5) might be empty? Previously tail was there, but now moved.\n\nCurrent positions: head (4,5), body (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)\n\n(3,5) is empty now.\n\n- R: to (5,5) — (5,5) is occupied by body seg5 (tail? Positions: seg1 (4,4), seg2 (5,4), seg3 (6,4), seg4 (6,5), seg5 (5,5) tail.\n\n(5,5) is tail, so moving to (5,5) might be safe since it's tail.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFirst, U to (4,6) is wall, invalid.\n\nL to (3,5): empty, safe.\n\nR to (5,5): tail, so if I move, it should be safe.\n\nAfter moving to (5,5): head to (5,5), which is current tail position.\n\nThen new positions: head (5,5), seg1 to old head (4,5), seg2 to old seg1 (4,4), seg3 to old seg2 (5,4), seg4 to old seg3 (6,4), seg5 to old seg4 (6,5)\n\nNo growth, tail at (6,5)\n\nNow, from (4,5), if I move L to (3,5), then I can go left towards (1,6).\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), so from (3,5), I need to go to (2,5), (1,5), then U to (1,6), or something.\n\nBut let's compare the two options.\n\nIf I go down to eat (6,1), I can get it by turn 20, but after that, the snake is at the bottom, and I need to go back up to eat the other food or find more, but no more food mentioned, so probably only two foods for now.\n\nThe food might respawn or something, but the state doesn't say, so I think only these two.\n\nAfter eating (6,1), the snake is longer, 7 segments, at positions like (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), etc., which is near the bottom-left, but x=6,y=1.\n\nThen I need to go to (1,6) which is top-left.\n\nBut there is an obstacle at (4,6), so I need to go around.\n\nFrom there, I might go left to (4,1), (3,1), etc., then up.\n\nBut it might take time, and food at (1,6) has life span 9, so until turn 25, I have time.\n\nTurn 20 to turn 25, 5 turns, from (6,1) to (1,6), min distance |6-1| + |1-6| = 5+5=10, but with snake body, it might be longer, but I can do it in 10 moves or so, but since I have to move the body, it's possible.\n\nIf I don't eat (6,1) and go directly to (1,6), I might save time or something.\n\nBut (6,1) will disappear soon, so if I don't eat it, I miss the point.\n\nSince both are +1, I should eat both if possible.\n\nBut eating (6,1) first might be efficient.\n\nNow, back to the immediate choice at turn 17.\n\nIf I move L to (4,4) at turn 17, I might not reach (6,1) in time.\n\nFrom (4,4), after moving, I can go down or left, but not directly to (6,1).\n\nFor example, from (4,4) I can move D to (4,3) or L to (3,4), but (6,1) is to the right and down.\n\nTo go to (6,1) from (4,4), I need to go right and down, but from (4,4), moving R to (5,4) is not possible because (5,4) is body and also opposite direction issue? At turn 17, after moving L to (4,4), direction is L.\n\nTurn 18, from (4,4), I can move D to (4,3), or L to (3,4), or U to (4,5).\n\nIf I move D to (4,3), then I can continue down, but to go to (6,1), I need to go right later.\n\nFor example, from (4,3) to (5,3), etc., but it might take more turns.\n\nSpecifically, from turn 17: move L to (4,4)\n\nTurn 18: move D to (4,3)  // assuming I go down\n\nTurn 19: from (4,3) move D to (4,2) or R to (5,3), etc.\n\nTo reach (6,1), min from (4,3) is to (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1) or something, but from (4,3) to (6,1) is |2| in x, |2| in y, so 4 moves min.\n\nBut from turn 18 position: after turn 18, head at (4,3)\n\nThen turn 19 move to (4,2) or (5,3)\n\nSay turn 19 move to (5,3)\n\nThen turn 20 to (5,2)\n\nTurn 21 to (5,1)\n\nTurn 22 to (6,1)\n\nBut at turn 22, food life span: started at 6 on turn 17, after turn 17:5, turn18:4, turn19:3, turn20:2, turn21:1, turn22:0? At turn 22, before move, life span might be 0 or 1?\n\nAt turn 17, life span 6.\n\nAfter each turn, it decreases, including after turn 17.\n\nSo after turn 17, life span 5.\n\nAfter turn 18, life span 4.\n\nAfter turn 19, life span 3.\n\nAfter turn 20, life span 2.\n\nAfter turn 21, life span 1.\n\nAfter turn 22, life span 0, so it disappears, so on turn 22, if I move to (6,1), it might be gone or not.\n\nThe rule: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nIt might be ambiguous, but to be safe, assume that if life span reaches 0, it disappears before the turn or after.\n\nTypically, in such games, food is present at the start of turn if life span >0, and after move, it decreases.\n\nSo at start of turn t, if life span >0, food is present, can be eaten that turn.\n\nAfter eating or after turn, life span decreases.\n\nFor (6,1) at turn 17: life span 6 >0, present.\n\nAfter turn 17, life span 5.\n\nTurn 18: life span 5>0, present.\n\n...\n\nTurn 22: at start, life span? After turn 21, life span 1, so at start of turn 22, life span 1>0, present. If I move to it on turn 22, I eat it, then after turn, life span decreases to 0 and disappears.\n\nSimilarly, if not eaten, after turn 22, it disappears.\n\nSo on turn 22, I can still eat it.\n\nIn the path above, if I go to (6,1) on turn 22, I can eat it.\n\nBut in the first path, I ate it on turn 20.\n\nNow, in this alternative, from moving L at turn 17, I might reach (6,1) on turn 22, which is later and riskier if something happens.\n\nMoreover, during the path, I might be blocked.\n\nFor example, from (4,4) at turn 18, if I move D to (4,3), then turn 19 to (5,3), but at turn 19, positions depend.\n\nBut it's doable, but takes more turns.\n\nTherefore, it's better to go directly for (6,1) by moving D at turn 17.\n\nBut there might be a risk I haven't considered.\n\nAnother thing: Tail Reward Danger.\n\nThe rule says: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nIn this case, for (6,1), the tail is not adjacent, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly for now.\n\nAfter eating (6,1), the snake is at bottom, and I need to go to (1,6).\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nAfter eating at (6,1), positions: head (6,1), body (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nFrom here, I can move left to (5,1)? (5,1) is occupied by body, so I need to move U or L or R, but R to (7,1) is wall, x=7 wall, so invalid.\n\nL to (5,1) is body, collision.\n\nU to (6,2) — is it empty? Probably.\n\nD to (6,0) but y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nSo only U to (6,2).\n\nThen from there, I can go left and up.\n\nFor example, to (1,6), I need to go to x=1, y=6.\n\nCurrent y=1, x=6.\n\nI can go U to (6,2), then U to (6,3), but at (6,3) might be ok, but then I need to go left, but the body is behind me.\n\nPositions after moving U from (6,1) to (6,2): head (6,2), body (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4) // and since no food, tail moves, so new tail at (6,4)? After growth, tail is at (6,5) before, but after move without eating, tail moves.\n\nIn this case, after eating at turn 20, positions: head (6,1), body (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nTurn 21: move U to (6,2) — no food, so move: head (6,2), seg1 (6,1), seg2 (5,1), seg3 (5,2), seg4 (5,3), seg5 (5,4), seg6 (6,4) // tail at (6,4)\n\nThen I can move U to (6,3), then to (6,4)? But (6,4) might be body.\n\nAfter moving to (6,3): head (6,3), body (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4) // seg1 to (6,2), etc., tail at (5,4)\n\nThen move to (6,4)? (6,4) is not occupied now, but (6,4) was seg6 before, but now moved.\n\nFrom (6,3), I can move L to (5,3), but (5,3) is occupied by body? Positions: head (6,3), body (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4) — so (5,3) is seg6, body segment, so moving to (5,3) would collide.\n\nSimilarly, U to (6,4) — (6,4) should be empty? From positions, (6,4) is not listed, so empty.\n\nAfter turn 21: positions: head (6,3), body: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4) // so (5,4) is tail.\n\n(6,4) is empty.\n\nSo move U to (6,4): safe.\n\nThen from (6,4), I can move L to (5,4), but (5,4) is tail? (5,4) is current tail.\n\nMoving to (5,4) might be safe if tail moves.\n\nBut let's not go too deep.\n\nI can go up to y=6, then left to x=1.\n\nBut there is an obstacle at (4,6), so at y=6, I need to avoid (4,6).\n\nFor example, from (6,4) move to (6,5), (6,6) but y=6, y=7 wall, so y=6 is ok but border at y=7.\n\ny=0 and y=7 walls, so y=6 is not wall.\n\nMove to (6,5), then (6,6), then left to (5,6), etc., but (4,6) is obstacle, so I need to go to (3,6), (2,6), (1,6).\n\nFrom (1,6) to eat.\n\nBut food at (1,6) is at (1,6), so I need to be there.\n\nNow, if I didn't eat (6,1) first, and went to (1,6) directly from start.\n\nBut from turn 17, if I move L to (4,4), then I can go left.\n\nFor example, turn 17: move L to (4,4)\n\nTurn 18: move L to (3,4) // for example\n\nFrom (4,4), move L to (3,4): head to (3,4), body (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5) // tail at (5,5)\n\nThen turn 19: move to (3,5) or (2,4), etc.\n\n(3,5) was tail but moved.\n\nMove to (2,4), then to (1,4), then U to (1,5), U to (1,6).\n\nBut (1,6) might be reachable by turn 20 or 21.\n\nTurn 17: to (4,4)\n\nTurn 18: to (3,4)\n\nTurn 19: to (2,4)\n\nTurn 20: to (1,4)\n\nTurn 21: to (1,5) // U\n\nTurn 22: to (1,6) // U to eat\n\nAnd food at (1,6) life span 9 at turn 17, after turns: turn18:8, t19:7, t20:6, t21:5, t22:4, so at turn 22, still present.\n\nBut I missed (6,1) which disappears earlier.\n\n(6,1) disappears after turn 22, as we said, so if I don't eat it by turn 22, I lose it.\n\nIn this path, I eat (1,6) on turn 22, but (6,1) is not eaten, and it disappears.\n\nSo I miss one point.\n\nWhereas if I eat (6,1) first on turn 20, I can still eat (1,6) later, since it lasts until turn 25 or so.\n\nTurn 25: life span 9 at turn 17, after t17:8, t18:7, ..., t24:1, t25:0, so eat by turn 24.\n\nFrom turn 20 after eating (6,1), I have until turn 24 to eat (1,6), 4 turns? Turn 20 to turn 24 is 4 moves, but I need to travel from (6,1) to (1,6), which is distance |5| x, |5| y, but with body, min 10 moves or so, but I can do it in more turns.\n\nFor example, from (6,1) after eating, at turn 20, positions head (6,1), etc.\n\nTurn 21: move U to (6,2)\n\nTurn 22: move U to (6,3)\n\nTurn 23: move U to (6,4)\n\nTurn 24: move U to (6,5)\n\nBut now I'm at (6,5), need to go left to (1,6).\n\nFrom (6,5), I can move L to (5,5), but (5,5) might be body or not.\n\nAfter turn 24: if I go to (6,5), positions: let's not simulate all.\n\nBut to go to (1,6), from (6,5) to (1,6) is |5| x, |1| y, so I can move left multiple times, but need to go to y=6.\n\n(1,6) is at y=6, so from (6,5), move to (5,5), (4,5), but (4,5) might be occupied, but it moves.\n\nI can go to (6,6) first if possible.\n\ny=6 is not wall, y=7 is wall.\n\nSo from (6,5) move U to (6,6)\n\nThen from (6,6) move L to (5,6), (4,6) is obstacle, so cannot go to (4,6), so need to go to (3,6) or something.\n\n(4,6) is obstacle, so cells around: from (5,6) I can go to (5,5) or (5,7) invalid, or (4,6) invalid, so only down or left/right but x.\n\n(5,6) to (4,6) not possible, so from (5,6) I can move D to (5,5) or L to (4,6) invalid, R to (6,6) if not, etc.\n\nBut it might take time, and I might not reach (1,6) by turn 24.\n\nFor example, from turn 20 at (6,1):\n\nTurn 21: U to (6,2)\n\nTurn 22: U to (6,3)\n\nTurn 23: U to (6,4)\n\nTurn 24: U to (6,5)  // now at (6,5)\n\nTurn 25: U to (6,6)  // y=6\n\nTurn 26: L to (5,6)\n\nBut (4,6) obstacle, so from (5,6) I can move L to (4,6)? Invalid, or D to (5,5), or U to (5,7) invalid, so only D to (5,5)\n\nTurn 26: move to (5,6)? From (6,6) to (5,6)\n\nThen turn 27: from (5,6) move L to (4,6) invalid, or D to (5,5), or R to (6,6), so move D to (5,5)\n\nThen turn 28: from (5,5) move L to (4,5), etc.\n\nTo reach (1,6), it might take until turn 30 or more, but food at (1,6) disappears after turn 25 (since after turn 25, life span 0), so at turn 25, if not eaten, gone.\n\nAt turn 24, life span? After turn 23, life span 9-7=2? Start turn 17:9, after t17:8, t18:7, t19:6, t20:5, t21:4, t22:3, t23:2, t24:1, so at turn 24, can eat, after turn 24 to 0.\n\nAt turn 25, gone.\n\nSo I need to eat by turn 24.\n\nBut at turn 24, I am at (6,5), far from (1,6).\n\nSo I cannot reach (1,6) in time if I eat (6,1) first.\n\nTherefore, it might be better to eat (1,6) first since it is farther but has longer life, and (6,1) is closer but shorter life, but if I go to (1,6) first, I might miss (6,1).\n\nLet's see if I can eat (1,6) quickly from start.\n\nFrom turn 17, head at (5,4), move L to (4,4)\n\nThen as before, to go to (1,6):\n\nTurn 17: L to (4,4)\n\nTurn 18: L to (3,4)  // for example\n\nTurn 19: L to (2,4)\n\nTurn 20: L to (1,4)\n\nTurn 21: U to (1,5)\n\nTurn 22: U to (1,6) eat.\n\nYes, by turn 22.\n\n(6,1) can be eaten until turn 22, so on turn 22, I can eat (1,6), but (6,1) is still present, but I'm at (1,6), far away, so I cannot eat (6,1) on same turn.\n\nAfter eating (1,6) at turn 22, I need to go to (6,1), but (6,1) disappears after turn 22, so at turn 23, it's gone, so I cannot eat it.\n\nTherefore, I can only eat one of them, since they are at opposite corners.\n\nBut I should eat both? Is it possible?\n\nPerhaps from the current position, I can eat (6,1) quickly, then somehow go to (1,6) faster.\n\nBut as above, from (6,1) to (1,6) is 10 units, min 10 moves, but with body, it might be more, and I have only 4 turns from turn 20 to 24, not enough.\n\nTurn 20 to 24 is 4 turns, I can move 4 steps, not enough for 10 distance.\n\nFor example, from (6,1) to (1,6), Manhattan distance 5+5=10, so min 10 moves, but since I need to path, it could be more, but at least 10.\n\nFrom turn 20 to turn 24, I can make 4 moves (t21,t22,t23,t24), so at best to (2,5) or something, not (1,6).\n\nSo impossible to eat both if I eat (6,1) first.\n\nIf I eat (1,6) first, I can eat it by turn 22, and (6,1) is lost.\n\nBut (6,1) has shorter life, so I should eat it first, but then I lose (1,6).\n\nPerhaps I can eat (6,1) and forget (1,6), but both are +1, so I want both.\n\nAnother idea: from current position, instead of going directly down, I can go left first a bit, then down, but it might not help.\n\nOr, I can eat (6,1) and then the snake is longer, but I still can't reach (1,6) in time.\n\nUnless there is a way to go faster, but no.\n\nPerhaps I don't need to eat both, but since both are positive, I should try to eat as many as possible.\n\nBut in this case, I can only eat one.\n\nSo which one to choose?\n\n(6,1) is closer, so easier to eat, and I can do it in 3 moves from now (t17 D, t18 D, t19 D, t20 R to eat, but t17 to (5,3), t18 to (5,2), t19 to (5,1), t20 to (6,1), so 4 moves including the eat move.\n\nFrom turn 17 to 20.\n\nFor (1,6), from turn 17, if I go left, t17 L to (4,4), t18 L to (3,4), t19 L to (2,4), t20 L to (1,4), t21 U to (1,5), t22 U to (1,6), so 6 moves, eat at t22.\n\n(6,1) can be eaten earlier, but (1,6) has longer life, so I can eat (1,6) later.\n\nBut as above, I can only eat one.\n\nBut let's confirm the life span.\n\nFood at (6,1): life span 6 at t17, so must eat by t22.\n\nFood at (1,6): life span 9 at t17, must eat by t25.\n\nIf I eat (6,1) at t20, I have from t21 to t24 to reach (1,6), but distance from (6,1) to (1,6) is 10, and 4 turns, not enough.\n\nIf I eat (1,6) at t22, I have from t17 to t22 to reach it, which takes 6 moves as above, but (6,1) is not eaten and lost.\n\nSo I can only eat one.\n\nTherefore, I should choose which one to eat based on risk or something.\n\nBut both are equal value, so perhaps choose the one that is easier or safer.\n\nEating (6,1) might be safer because it's closer, and the path is straightforward.\n\nFor (1,6), I need to go left, and there might be risks with the body or obstacle.\n\nFor example, when going to (1,6), from (3,4) to (2,4) to (1,4) to (1,5) to (1,6), all should be empty.\n\nBut at turn 17, after moving L to (4,4), positions: head (4,4), body (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nThen turn 18 move L to (3,4): head (3,4), body (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)\n\nThen turn 19 move L to (2,4): head (2,4), body (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nThen turn 20 move L to (1,4): head (1,4), body (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4)  // tail at (6,4)? Old seg5 at (6,5), moved to old seg4 (6,4)? Positions: after move, seg1 to (2,4)? Head to (1,4), seg1 to old head (2,4), seg2 to old seg1 (3,4), seg3 to old seg2 (4,4), seg4 to old seg3 (5,4), seg5 to old seg4 (6,4), and old seg5 (6,5) is gone, tail at (6,4)\n\nThen turn 21 move U to (1,5): head (1,5), body (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4)  // tail at (5,4)\n\nThen turn 22 move U to (1,6): eat, grow, new positions head (1,6), body (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4) and new segment at old tail (5,4)? After move with food: head to (1,6), seg1 to (1,5), seg2 to (1,4), seg3 to (2,4), seg4 to (3,4), seg5 to (4,4), seg6 to (5,4), and new segment at old tail position, which was (5,4), so new seg7 at (5,4), but that cell is now occupied by seg6, so it might be the same, but positions: seg6 at (5,4), new seg7 at (5,4), so it's duplicate, not good.\n\nMistake.\n\nBefore move turn 22: head at (1,5), body: (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4)  // seg1 (1,4), seg2 (2,4), etc., tail (5,4)\n\nMove head to (1,6)\n\nEat food, so grow: new head (1,6), then seg1 to old head (1,5), seg2 to old seg1 (1,4), seg3 to old seg2 (2,4), seg4 to old seg3 (3,4), seg5 to old seg4 (4,4), seg6 to old seg5 (5,4), and since food eaten, new segment at old tail position (5,4), but (5,4) is already the position of seg6, so it would be two segments at (5,4), which is wrong.\n\nI think I confused.\n\nWhen you eat food, the tail does not move, so the new segment is added at the old tail position, and the tail stays there.\n\nSo before move, positions: P0 head (1,5), P1 (1,4), P2 (2,4), P3 (3,4), P4 (4,4), P5 (5,4) tail.\n\nAfter move: head moves to new position N (1,6)\n\nThen, each body segment moves to the previous position: so P1 moves to P0 (1,5), P2 moves to P1 (1,4), P3 moves to P2 (2,4), P4 moves to P3 (3,4), P5 moves to P4 (4,4)\n\nBut since food eaten, a new segment is added at the old P5 position, so new P5 at (5,4), and P5 was moved to (4,4), so the segments are: head (1,6), P1 (1,5), P2 (1,4), P3 (2,4), P4 (3,4), P5 (4,4), and new P6 at (5,4)\n\nYes, so positions: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4)\n\nTail at (5,4)\n\nOk.\n\nBack to the decision.\n\nSince I can only eat one food, I should eat (6,1) because it's closer and I can do it with less risk, and (1,6) is farther and I might not reach it anyway if I eat (6,1), but since I can't eat both, eating one is fine.\n\nBut in terms of score, both +1, so same.\n\nBut perhaps for long-term, after eating, I can survive to eat more food that might appear, but the state doesn't say, so I think only these two.\n\nSo I should go for the closer one, (6,1).\n\nMoreover, with the body positions, going down might be safer.\n\nAnother risk: when I move to (5,3) on turn 17, is there any danger?\n\n(5,3) is empty, so ok.\n\nThen to (5,2), (5,1), all empty.\n\nThen to (6,1), empty.\n\nAfter that, I need to move up to avoid being trapped, but since I can only eat one, it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I can consider not eating any and survive, but that gives 0 score, while eating one gives +1, so better to eat.\n\nSo I think moving D at turn 17 is best.\n\nThen the plan is:\n\nTurn 17: D\n\nTurn 18: D\n\nTurn 19: D\n\nTurn 20: R\n\nTo eat the food.\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nTurn 17 to 21 or something.\n\nAfter turn 20, I need to move away.\n\nFor example, after eating at (6,1), I can move up.\n\nSo for 5 turns, I can output turns 17 to 21.\n\nTurn 17: D to (5,3)\n\nTurn 18: D to (5,2)\n\nTurn 19: D to (5,1)\n\nTurn 20: R to (6,1) eat\n\nTurn 21: U to (6,2) or something.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to specify the actions.\n\nAlso, the head direction changes.\n\nAt turn 17, move D, so direction becomes D.\n\nTurn 18, from (5,3), move D, direction D.\n\nTurn 19, from (5,2), move D, direction D.\n\nTurn 20, from (5,1), move R to (6,1), direction R.\n\nThen turn 21, from (6,1), I can move U, L, R, not D (opposite).\n\nSince walls, only U to (6,2) is possible, as L to (5,1) is body, R to (7,1) wall.\n\nSo U to (6,2).\n\nSimilarly, I can include that.\n\nBut the food at (1,6) is there, but I can't reach it, so no need.\n\nNow, what about the other option? If I move L at turn 17, I might go to (1,6) but miss (6,1).\n\nBut since (6,1) is closer, and I can eat it earlier, it might be better for score, as I get the point sooner, but in terms of total, same if I eat one.\n\nBut with moving L, I eat at turn 22, later.\n\nBut also, with moving D, I eat at turn 20, so I have the point earlier.\n\nBut in survival, no difference.\n\nI think moving D is fine.\n\nBut let's see the tail reward danger or other risks.\n\nIn this case, no food near tail.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (4,6) is not in the way for this path.\n\nSo I think it's safe.\n\nTherefore, for turn 17, action D.\n\nThen for the answer, I need to output multiple turns.\n\nThe format is to output actions for turns t1, t1+1, etc., at least 5 turns, so from turn 17 to 21 or 22.\n\nSince I have a plan for 4 moves to eat, I can do 5 turns including after.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 17: D\n\nTurn 18: D\n\nTurn 19: D\n\nTurn 20: R\n\nTurn 21: U  // after eating, move up.\n\nAnd for turn 21, move U to (6,2) as above.\n\nNow, to confirm, after turn 21, positions: as before, head (6,2), body (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4) or something, but it's fine.\n\nI think that's the plan.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 17):**\n- **Grid Size:** 8x8 (walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7; internal obstacle at (4,6)).\n- **Snake:** Head at (5,4) with direction left (L). Positions: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] (length 6).\n- **Food:**\n  - (6,1): Value +1, life span 6 (disappears after turn 22).\n  - (1,6): Value +1, life span 9 (disappears after turn 25).\n\n**Immediate Move (Turn 17) Constraints:**\n- Current head direction is L, so cannot move right (R) due to no instant reverse.\n- Possible moves from (5,4): \n  - U to (5,5): Occupied by body segment (not tail), collision—deadly.\n  - D to (5,3): Empty, safe.\n  - L to (4,4): Empty, safe.\n  - R to (6,4): Occupied by body segment (not tail), collision—deadly and invalid due to reverse.\n- **Safe options:** D or L.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy (5+ Turns Ahead):**\n- **Prioritize eating (6,1):** It has a shorter life span (must be eaten by turn 22) and is closer (Manhattan distance 3 from head). Eating it early secures +1 score and avoids missing it. Path: Move down repeatedly to (5,1), then right to (6,1) by turn 20.\n- **Avoid (1,6) for now:** It has a longer life span (until turn 25), but after eating (6,1), the snake will be at (6,1) with a length of 7. The distance to (1,6) is 10 units (Manhattan), requiring at least 10 moves. With only 4 turns available (turns 21-24) before it disappears, it is impossible to reach (1,6) in time. Thus, eating both foods is not feasible—focus on (6,1).\n- **Risk Assessment:** \n  - The path to (6,1) is low-risk: all target cells are empty, and no immediate body/tail threats.\n  - After eating, move up to (6,2) to avoid walls and body collisions.\n  - Tail Reward Danger: Not applicable—no food adjacent to tail.\n- **Survival Focus:** After eating, steer the snake upward and left to open areas for future food opportunities, but no additional food is specified in the state.\n\n**Planned Moves (Turns 17-21):**\n- **Turn 17:** Move D to (5,3) — Begins path to (6,1); direction becomes D.\n- **Turn 18:** Move D to (5,2) — Continues down; direction D.\n- **Turn 19:** Move D to (5,1) — Position to approach (6,1); direction D.\n- **Turn 20:** Move R to (6,1) — Eats positive food; snake grows to length 7; direction R.\n- **Turn 21:** Move U to (6,2) — Avoids wall at y=0 and body; opens path for future movement; direction U.\n\n**Simulation Key Points:**\n- **Turn 20 Food Check:** (6,1) life span at turn 17 is 6. After turns: 17 (5), 18 (4), 19 (3), 20 (2) — still present at turn 20, eaten successfully.\n- **Collision Avoidance:** All moves are to empty cells except turn 20, where (6,1) is unoccupied. Body segments move away, no collisions.\n- **Efficiency:** Eating (6,1) at turn 20 maximizes score with minimal risk. (1,6) is ignored as unreachable post-eating.\n\n**Answer Format:**\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 17: D (down)  \nTurn 18: D (down)  \nTurn 19: D (down)  \nTurn 20: R (right)  \nTurn 21: U (up)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 18, and I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (5,3), and body segments follow: (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5). So the snake has 6 segments. Head direction is down, which is (x,y-1) since down decreases y.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (6,1) with value 1 and life span 5. That means it disappears after 5 turns, including this one, so by turn 22 it's gone if not eaten.\n\n- (1,6) with value 1 and life span 8, so disappears after turn 25.\n\nBoth are positive food since value is +1.\n\nI need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score and prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No, walls are at x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to 6 are free? Similarly for y.\n\nBorder cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So the snake can be on x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? Let's see snake positions: (5,3) is head, (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5). All these have x from 4 to 6, y from 3 to 5, so within 1 to 6? y=3,4,5; x=4,5,6. But y=6 is possible? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to 6 should be free, but y=6 is not a wall? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to 6 are free, similarly x=1 to 6 are free, except internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), so that cell is blocked.\n\nSo playable cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (4,6) is blocked.\n\nNow snake: head at (5,3), direction down. Down means moving to lower y, so from (5,3) down would be to (5,2).\n\nBut let's list all positions:\n\n- Head: (5,3)\n\n- Segment 1: (5,4)  // directly behind head? Head is at (5,3), and next is (5,4), which is above, since y=4 > y=3, so if head is moving down, from where? Previous position must have been above.\n\nSnake positions: [(5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nHead is (5,3), then (5,4), which has higher y, so if head is at (5,3) and moving down, that means it was previously at (5,4) or something? I need to infer the movement.\n\nHead direction is given as D, down, so the snake is facing down, meaning the next move could be down, left, or right, but not up, since no instant reverse.\n\nCurrent head position: (5,3)\n\nPrevious head position must be where the neck is. The positions are listed head first, so head at index 0: (5,3), then body at index 1: (5,4), which is directly above the head, since y=4 vs y=3. So the head is below the first body segment.\n\nSince the snake is moving down, from (5,4) to (5,3), I assume. Positions are given as a list, so the head is first, then the body segments in order to the tail.\n\nSo at turn 18, head is at (5,3), which it just moved to, and the body was previously at these positions, but after move, the tail end moves.\n\nStandard snake movement: when the snake moves, the head goes to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail is removed if no growth.\n\nBut when food is eaten, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n\nIn this case, no food eaten this turn, I think, since positions are given.\n\nSnake positions: [(5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nSo length 6.\n\nHead at (5,3), moving down, so it came from (5,4) to (5,3), since (5,4) is now the first body segment.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, from (5,3), possible moves: since direction is down, I can move down, left, or right, but not up (reverse).\n\nPossible actions: U, D, L, R, but no reverse, so cannot move up to (5,4), which is occupied by the body anyway.\n\nCurrent head: (5,3)\n\nMove down: to (5,2)\n\nMove left: to (4,3)\n\nMove right: to (6,3)\n\nNow, check if these are valid:\n\nFirst, walls: borders at x=0,7 y=0,7, so (5,2): x=5, y=2, y=2 >0 and <7, so not border wall. Similarly (4,3) and (6,3) are within bounds.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), not relevant here.\n\nNow, body collisions: if I move to a cell occupied by body, it's deadly, except for the tail.\n\nThe body positions are: (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nTail is at (4,5)\n\nIf I move to (5,2), is it occupied? No, not in the list.\n\n(4,3): not in list.\n\n(6,3): not in list.\n\nSo all three moves are potentially safe for now.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, food: there is food at (6,1) and (1,6)\n\n(6,1) is at x=6,y=1, which is above the bottom wall, y=1 is safe.\n\n(1,6) at x=1,y=6.\n\nLife span: (6,1) has life span 5, meaning it will disappear after 5 turns including this one. Since current turn is 18, it will be gone at turn 23? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for food at (6,1), life span 5 at turn 18. After turn 18, life span becomes 4, then 3,2,1,0. When life span 0, it disappears, so after turn 22, it's gone. Turn 18: life span 5, turn 19:4, turn20:3, turn21:2, turn22:1, turn23:0, so disappears at turn 23. Similarly, (1,6) life span 8 at turn 18, disappears at turn 25.\n\nNow, I need to plan multiple moves to eat food while avoiding risks.\n\nFirst, let's find a path to the food.\n\nFood at (6,1) is closer to the head. Head at (5,3), food at (6,1).\n\nDistance: delta x =1, delta y=2, so Manhattan distance 3.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) is far: delta x=4, delta y=3, distance 7.\n\nBut (6,1) has shorter life, only 5 turns left, so I might need to go for it soon.\n\nBut I need to survive and think long-term.\n\nAlso, there might be risks with the body.\n\nCurrent snake body: positions (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nThe area around head: (5,3)\n\nNorth: (5,4) is body, cannot go there.\n\nSouth: (5,2) is empty\n\nWest: (4,3) empty\n\nEast: (6,3) empty\n\nNow, if I go south to (5,2), that might be towards the food at (6,1).\n\nFrom (5,2), I can go to (5,1), (4,2), (6,2), etc.\n\n(5,1) is y=1, which is not wall, since walls at y=0.\n\ny=1 is safe.\n\nThen to (6,1) from (5,1) or (6,2).\n\nSimilarly, from (6,3) I can go to (6,2) then (6,1).\n\nBut let's see possible paths.\n\nI should consider the tail and body movements.\n\nAlso, the tail is at (4,5), which will move when the snake moves, unless food is eaten.\n\nIf I eat food, the snake grows, so tail stays.\n\nBut for now, no food.\n\nAnother thing: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (4,5), and there is no food there, so no issue now.\n\nFood is at (6,1) and (1,6), not near tail.\n\nSo let's plan moves.\n\nI need to output actions for multiple turns, but the state might change after each move, especially if I eat food or life span decreases.\n\nThe answer format is to output a sequence of actions starting from turn 18.\n\nBut after each action, the state changes, so I need to simulate.\n\nSince no new food is spawned, and only life span decreases, I can plan based on current state, but I need to consider the snake's body moving.\n\nTo plan 5+ turns ahead, I should simulate possible moves.\n\nFirst, let's list possible actions for turn 18.\n\nFrom head (5,3), direction down, so can move:\n\n- D (down) to (5,2)\n\n- L (left) to (4,3)\n\n- R (right) to (6,3)\n\nCannot U (up) to (5,4) because reverse and occupied.\n\nNow, I want to go towards (6,1).\n\n(6,1) is east and south.\n\nFrom (5,3), moving R to (6,3) gets me closer in x, then from there I can go down to (6,2) or (6,1) if possible.\n\n(6,3) to (6,2) to (6,1).\n\n(6,2) might be free now? Let's see current occupied cells.\n\nOccupied: (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nSo (6,3) is free, (6,2) is free, (6,1) has food.\n\nIf I go R to (6,3) on turn 18.\n\nThen on turn 19, head at (6,3), direction? If I moved right, new direction is right, so I can move D, L, R, not U (since reverse of left? Directions: if I moved right, facing right, so cannot move left (reverse).\n\nCurrent direction after move: when I move, the direction changes.\n\nAt turn 18, before move, head direction is down.\n\nAfter moving right to (6,3), the new head direction is right.\n\nThen possible moves: down to (6,2), left to (5,3), or right to (7,3), but x=7 is wall, so cannot move right. x=7 is border wall, so (7,3) invalid.\n\nLeft to (5,3): (5,3) is the previous head position, which is now the first body segment? After move, snake positions change.\n\nI need to simulate the snake movement.\n\nDefine the state after each move.\n\nTurn 18 start: snake positions: H=(5,3), B1=(5,4), B2=(6,4), B3=(6,5), B4=(5,5), T=(4,5)  // T is tail.\n\nHead direction: down.\n\nAction: say move R to (6,3)\n\nThen new head position: (6,3)\n\nNew body: the first body segment moves to old head position (5,3), then B2 to B1 old position (5,4), B3 to B2 old (6,4), B4 to B3 old (6,5), and tail moves to B4 old position (5,5).\n\nSnake segments: after move, the new positions are:\n\nHead: new position (6,3)\n\nThen the previous head (5,3) becomes the new first body segment.\n\nThen the previous B1 (5,4) becomes new second body segment.\n\nPrevious B2 (6,4) becomes new third.\n\nPrevious B3 (6,5) becomes new fourth.\n\nPrevious B4 (5,5) becomes new fifth? Positions list: indices.\n\nBefore move: positions: [ (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) ]  // index 0:head, 1,2,3,4,5: body to tail.\n\nAfter moving head to (6,3):\n\nNew head: (6,3)\n\nThen new body: the segment at index 1 moves to index 0 position (5,3)? No.\n\nWhen head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo:\n\n- New head: (6,3)\n\n- Segment that was index 1 ( (5,4) ) moves to where index 0 was, which is (5,3)\n\n- Segment that was index 2 ( (6,4) ) moves to where index 1 was, (5,4)\n\n- Segment that was index 3 ( (6,5) ) moves to where index 2 was, (6,4)\n\n- Segment that was index 4 ( (5,5) ) moves to where index 3 was, (6,5)\n\n- Segment that was index 5 (tail) ( (4,5) ) moves to where index 4 was, (5,5)\n\nSo new positions: [ (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5) ]\n\nTail is now at (5,5)\n\nAnd the cell (4,5) is now empty.\n\nNew head direction: since moved right, direction is now right.\n\nNow, from (6,3), I can move down to (6,2), left to (5,3), or right to (7,3) but x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nLeft to (5,3): but (5,3) is now a body segment, specifically the first body segment after head.\n\nNew positions: head at (6,3), then (5,3) is body, so if I move left to (5,3), I collide with body, deadly.\n\nCannot move left.\n\nMove down to (6,2): should be free, let's see occupied: (6,3) head, (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5). So (6,2) not in list, should be free.\n\nMove right invalid.\n\nSo only possible move down to (6,2) or... what about up? But direction is right, moving up is not reverse? Reverse would be left, which is opposite to right.\n\nDirections: U, D, L, R.\n\nCurrent direction right, so moving left is reverse, not allowed. Moving up or down are perpendicular, allowed.\n\nBut moving up to (6,4): (6,4) is a body segment, occupied, so cannot move there anyway.\n\nSimilarly, moving down to (6,2) is possible.\n\nSo from (6,3), only down to (6,2) is safe and possible.\n\nThen on turn 19, move down to (6,2).\n\nNew head: (6,2)\n\nNew body: [ (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) ] and tail at (6,5)? Let's list:\n\nAfter move to (6,2):\n\n- New head: (6,2)\n\n- Body: segment from previous index 1 moves to (6,3) — previous head position\n\nPrevious positions before this move: [ (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5) ]\n\nAfter moving head to (6,2):\n\n- New head: (6,2)\n\n- New index 1: moves to old index 0 position (6,3)\n\n- New index 2: moves to old index 1 position (5,3)\n\n- New index 3: moves to old index 2 position (5,4)\n\n- New index 4: moves to old index 3 position (6,4)\n\n- New index 5 (tail): moves to old index 4 position (6,5)\n\nSo positions: [ (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) ]\n\nTail at (6,5)\n\nNow, head at (6,2), direction down (since moved down).\n\nFood at (6,1) is directly below.\n\nMove down to (6,1) to eat food.\n\nBut (6,1) is free? Currently occupied cells: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5). (6,1) not occupied, and no wall, so yes.\n\nMove down to (6,1) on turn 20? Let's sequence.\n\nTurn 18: move R to (6,3)\n\nTurn 19: move D to (6,2)\n\nTurn 20: move D to (6,1), eat food.\n\nSince food is eaten, snake grows, so tail does not move.\n\nOn turn 20, before move, positions: [ (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) ] head at (6,2)\n\nMove down to (6,1)\n\nNew head: (6,1)\n\nSince food eaten, the tail does not move, so new body: the segments move to previous positions, but tail stays.\n\nSo positions: new head (6,1)\n\nThen new index 1: old index 0 position (6,2)\n\nNew index 2: old index 1 position (6,3)\n\nNew index 3: old index 2 position (5,3)\n\nNew index 4: old index 3 position (5,4)\n\nNew index 5: old index 4 position (6,4)\n\nAnd since food eaten, add a new segment at old tail position? No.\n\nWhen food eaten, the head moves to food cell, the body segments move as usual, but the tail is not removed, so the snake grows by one segment.\n\nSo previous tail position is still part of the snake.\n\nIn this case, before move, tail is at (6,5)\n\nAfter head moves to (6,1), the body:\n\n- Segment that was index 1 moves to (6,2) — old head position\n\n- Segment that was index 2 moves to old index 1 position (6,3)\n\n- Segment that was index 3 moves to old index 2 position (5,3)\n\n- Segment that was index 4 moves to old index 3 position (5,4)\n\n- Segment that was index 5 (tail) moves to old index 4 position (6,4)\n\nBut since food eaten, we add a new segment at the previous tail position? No.\n\nStandard: when food eaten, the tail does not move, so the segment that was tail remains, and a new segment is added at the position where the tail was before the move? I'm confusing.\n\nBetter to think: after the head moves to the food cell, all body segments shift, but since food eaten, the last segment (tail) is not removed, so the snake gains one segment at the tail end.\n\nBefore move, positions: let's say S = [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nAfter moving head to new position:\n\n- New head: new position\n\n- New B1: H (old head position)\n\n- New B2: old B1 position\n\n- ...\n\n- New Bk: old B_{k-1} position for body\n\n- New tail: since no removal, the old tail position is still occupied, but the segment that was tail moves to the position of the previous segment before it.\n\nIn terms of positions:\n\nAfter head move to new cell, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the segment before it in the list.\n\nSo for segment i, it moves to the position that segment i-1 had before the move.\n\nAnd since food eaten, the tail segment is not removed, so the last segment moves to its new position, and the old tail position is vacated? No.\n\nExample: before move, positions: P0 (head), P1, P2, ..., Pn (tail)\n\nAfter head moves to new position P_new:\n\n- New head: P_new\n\n- Segment 1 moves to P0\n\n- Segment 2 moves to P1\n\n- ...\n\n- Segment n (tail) moves to P_{n-1}\n\nSince food eaten, the tail moves to P_{n-1}, and we add a new segment at P_n, so the snake grows, with new positions: [P_new, P0, P1, P2, ..., P_{n-1}, P_n]\n\nIn this case, P_n is the old tail position, which is now the new second last, and the new tail is at P_n.\n\nIn terms of the list, the new positions include the old positions except the head is replaced, and all body segments shift, with the tail segment moving to the previous position of the last body segment, and since food eaten, the old tail position becomes a new body segment, but it's the same as before? I think I have it.\n\nAfter eating, the snake has one more segment, so the positions are: new head, then old head, then old B1, ..., old tail, in that order.\n\nIn my earlier:\n\nBefore move to (6,1): positions [ (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) ]  // head (6,2), tail (6,5)\n\nMove head to (6,1)\n\nNew head: (6,1)\n\nThen:\n\n- The segment that was at index 1 ( (6,3) ) moves to old head position (6,2)\n\n- The segment that was at index 2 ( (5,3) ) moves to old index 1 position (6,3)\n\n- The segment that was at index 3 ( (5,4) ) moves to old index 2 position (5,3)\n\n- The segment that was at index 4 ( (6,4) ) moves to old index 3 position (5,4)\n\n- The segment that was at index 5 (tail) ( (6,5) ) moves to old index 4 position (6,4)\n\nAnd since food eaten, we add a new segment at the old tail position (6,5), so it becomes part of the body.\n\nNew positions: [ (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) ]  // new head, then (6,2) from old head, (6,3) from old index1, (5,3) from old index2, (5,4) from old index3, (6,4) from old index4, and (6,5) is new from old tail.\n\nOld tail was (6,5), and it moved to (6,4), so the position (6,5) is now free? No.\n\nIn the new list, position (6,5) is still occupied by the new last segment, which is the old tail segment that moved to (6,4)? Let's clarify.\n\nAfter move:\n\n- New head at (6,1)\n\n- The body segment that was immediately behind head is now at the old head position (6,2)\n\n- The next body segment is at its new position, which was the position of the previous segment before move.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- The segment that was at (6,3) is now at (6,2)\n\n- The segment that was at (5,3) is now at (6,3)  // moved to old position of the segment before it\n\n- The segment that was at (5,4) is now at (5,3)\n\n- The segment that was at (6,4) is now at (5,4)\n\n- The segment that was at (6,5) is now at (6,4)\n\nAnd since food eaten, a new segment is added at the position where the tail was before the move, which is (6,5), so now there is an additional segment at (6,5).\n\nSo new positions: head (6,1), then segments at: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), and (6,5) as the new tail.\n\nLength increased by one.\n\nBack to the plan.\n\nIf I go to (6,1) by turn 20, I eat the food, gain +1 score, snake length 7.\n\nBut is this safe? On the way, from turn 18 to 19, I moved to (6,3), then (6,2), then (6,1).\n\nOn turn 18, after moving to (6,3), positions as above, then turn 19 to (6,2), positions [ (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) ]\n\nThen turn 20 to (6,1), eat, positions [ (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) ]\n\nNow, after that, I need to think where to go next.\n\nBut the food at (6,1) is eaten, so gone.\n\nThere is another food at (1,6).\n\nBut life span is long, 8 turns, so I have time.\n\nBut after eating at (6,1), I am at (6,1) with the snake body above me.\n\nHead at (6,1), direction down.\n\nPossible moves: down to (6,0) but y=0 is wall, invalid.\n\nLeft to (5,1)\n\nRight to (7,1) but x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nUp to (6,2) but (6,2) is body segment, occupied, cannot.\n\nSo only possible move left to (5,1).\n\n(5,1) should be free.\n\nMove left to (5,1) on turn 21.\n\nThen new head (5,1), direction left (since moved left).\n\nThen from there, I can go left to (4,1), down to (5,0) invalid, up to (5,2), or right to (6,1) but occupied.\n\n(5,2) might be free? Current positions after turn 20: [ (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) ]\n\nSo (5,1) free, (5,2) free? (5,2) not in list, should be free.\n\n(4,1) free, etc.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nThere is a problem with the body.\n\nIn this path, after eating at (6,1), I am trapped at the bottom with the body above, and only left move possible, to (5,1).\n\nThen from (5,1), I can go left to (4,1), or up to (5,2), or right to (6,1) occupied.\n\n(5,2) is free, so I can go up to (5,2).\n\nThen from (5,2), I can go left to (4,2), up to (5,3), but (5,3) is body? After moving to (5,1), let's simulate.\n\nTurn 21: from head (6,1) move left to (5,1)\n\nNew positions: head to (5,1), then body moves:\n\nPrevious positions: [ (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) ]\n\nAfter move to (5,1):\n\n- New head: (5,1)\n\n- Segment that was at index 1 ( (6,2) ) moves to (6,1)\n\n- Segment that was at index 2 ( (6,3) ) moves to (6,2)\n\n- Segment that was at index 3 ( (5,3) ) moves to (6,3)\n\n- Segment that was at index 4 ( (5,4) ) moves to (5,3)\n\n- Segment that was at index 5 ( (6,4) ) moves to (5,4)\n\n- Segment that was at index 6 (tail) ( (6,5) ) moves to (6,4)\n\nSince no food eaten, tail moves, so positions: [ (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4) ] tail at (6,4)\n\nHead at (5,1), direction left.\n\nNow possible moves: left to (4,1), up to (5,2), right to (6,1) but occupied.\n\n(4,1) free, (5,2) free.\n\nSay I go up to (5,2) on turn 22.\n\nThen new head (5,2), direction up (since moved up from (5,1), y increased).\n\nThen from (5,2), can move left to (4,2), up to (5,3), right to (6,2).\n\n(5,3) is body? Current positions: after move to (5,2), previous positions [ (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4) ]\n\nAfter move to (5,2):\n\n- New head: (5,2)\n\n- Segment that was index 1 ( (6,1) ) moves to (5,1)\n\n- Segment that was index 2 ( (6,2) ) moves to (6,1)\n\n- Segment that was index 3 ( (6,3) ) moves to (6,2)\n\n- Segment that was index 4 ( (5,3) ) moves to (6,3)\n\n- Segment that was index 5 ( (5,4) ) moves to (5,3)\n\n- Segment that was index 6 ( (6,4) ) moves to (5,4)\n\n- Tail moves to (6,4)? Segment that was tail at (6,4) moves to old index 5 position (5,4)\n\nNew positions: [ (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4) ] tail at (5,4)\n\nNow head at (5,2), can move:\n\n- Left to (4,2)\n\n- Up to (5,3) but (5,3) is body, occupied, cannot\n\n- Right to (6,2) but (6,2) is body, occupied\n\n- Down to (5,1) but (5,1) is body, occupied\n\n(5,3) is occupied, (6,2) occupied, (5,1) occupied.\n\nOnly possible move left to (4,2), which should be free.\n\nThen move left to (4,2) on turn 23.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut I'm moving away from the other food.\n\nMoreover, the snake body is creating a barrier.\n\nIn this path, I ate the food quickly, but now I'm in a tight spot with limited moves.\n\nI might get trapped.\n\nFor example, after turn 23, head at (4,2), then I can go to (4,1), (3,2), (4,3), etc., but the body is around.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nThere is internal obstacle at (4,6), but not relevant yet.\n\nThe other food at (1,6) is top-left, while I'm bottom-right.\n\nFrom (4,2), I can head towards (1,6), but it's far, and I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nBut this might be risky for long-term survival.\n\nPerhaps going directly to (6,1) is not the best because it leads to a corner.\n\nMaybe I should go left or down first to have more space.\n\nAnother option at turn 18: move down to (5,2) instead of right.\n\nLet's consider that.\n\nTurn 18: from (5,3) move down to (5,2)\n\nThen new head (5,2), direction down.\n\nNew positions: [ (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5) ] tail at (5,5)? Previous positions [ (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) ]\n\nAfter move down to (5,2):\n\n- New head: (5,2)\n\n- Segment index 1 moves to (5,3)  // old head\n\n- Index 2 moves to old index 1 (5,4)\n\n- Index 3 moves to old index 2 (6,4)\n\n- Index 4 moves to old index 3 (6,5)\n\n- Index 5 (tail) moves to old index 4 (5,5)\n\nSo positions: [ (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5) ] tail at (5,5)\n\nOld tail (4,5) is vacated.\n\nNow head at (5,2), direction down.\n\nPossible moves: down to (5,1), left to (4,2), right to (6,2)\n\nCannot up to (5,3) occupied and reverse? Direction down, moving up is reverse, not allowed.\n\n(5,1) free, (4,2) free, (6,2) free.\n\nFrom here, I can go to (6,1) via (6,2) or directly if possible.\n\nMove right to (6,2) on turn 19.\n\nThen to (6,1) on turn 20.\n\nSimilar to before.\n\nFrom (5,2), move down to (5,1) on turn 19, then right to (6,1) on turn 20.\n\nBut from (5,1) to (6,1) is right, but after moving down to (5,2), direction down, then down to (5,1), direction down, then from (5,1) move right to (6,1).\n\nOn turn 19: from (5,2) move down to (5,1)\n\nNew head (5,1), direction down.\n\nPositions: [ (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) ] tail at (6,5)? Previous before move: [ (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5) ]\n\nAfter move to (5,1):\n\n- New head: (5,1)\n\n- Index 1 moves to (5,2)\n\n- Index 2 moves to (5,3)\n\n- Index 3 moves to (5,4)\n\n- Index 4 moves to (6,4)\n\n- Index 5 moves to (6,5)\n\n- Tail moves to old index 4 position? Index 5 was at (5,5), moves to old index 4 position (6,5)? Old index 4 was (6,5), so moves to (6,5)? Let's not confuse.\n\nPrevious positions: indices 0: (5,2), 1: (5,3), 2: (5,4), 3: (6,4), 4: (6,5), 5: (5,5)\n\nAfter move head to (5,1):\n\n- New head: (5,1)\n\n- New index 1: moves to old index 0 position (5,2)\n\n- New index 2: moves to old index 1 position (5,3)\n\n- New index 3: moves to old index 2 position (5,4)\n\n- New index 4: moves to old index 3 position (6,4)\n\n- New index 5: moves to old index 4 position (6,5)\n\n- New index 6? No, length same, tail was index 5, which moves to old index 4 position (6,5), so new positions: [ (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) ] tail at (6,5)\n\nOld tail position (5,5) vacated.\n\nNow head at (5,1), can move down to (5,0) invalid, left to (4,1), right to (6,1), up to (5,2) occupied.\n\n(4,1) free, (6,1) has food, free to move.\n\nMove right to (6,1) on turn 20, eat food.\n\nThen similar situation as before.\n\nAfter eating, head at (6,1), with body above, only left move possible.\n\nSo same issue.\n\nTo avoid this, I should not go directly to (6,1) but first clear some space or go for the other food.\n\nBut the other food is far, and (6,1) has short life span, only 5 turns left, so if I don't eat it soon, it disappears.\n\nAt turn 18, life span 5, so after turn 22 it's gone. I have from turn 18 to 22 to eat it.\n\nTurn 18,19,20,21,22: 5 turns, but on turn 22 it has life span 1, after turn 22 it becomes 0 and disappears, so must eat by turn 22.\n\nSimilarly, I can eat on turn 22 if I'm on it.\n\nBut let's see if I can eat it later with more space.\n\nAnother option: at turn 18, move left to (4,3).\n\nFrom (5,3) move L to (4,3)\n\nThen new head (4,3), direction left (since moved left).\n\nNew positions: previous [ (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) ]\n\nAfter move to (4,3):\n\n- New head: (4,3)\n\n- Index 1 moves to (5,3)\n\n- Index 2 moves to (5,4)\n\n- Index 3 moves to (6,4)\n\n- Index 4 moves to (6,5)\n\n- Index 5 (tail) moves to (5,5)\n\nPositions: [ (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5) ] tail at (5,5)\n\nOld tail (4,5) vacated.\n\nHead at (4,3), direction left.\n\nPossible moves: down to (4,2), left to (3,3), up to (4,4), right to (5,3) occupied.\n\n(4,2) free, (3,3) free, (4,4) free? (4,4) not occupied, should be free.\n\nNow, from here, I can go down to (4,2), then to (4,1), etc., but not towards food.\n\nOr I can go up to (4,4), then to (4,5) but (4,5) was tail, now vacated, so free.\n\n(4,5) is free now.\n\nThen from (4,4) to (4,5) or (3,4), etc.\n\nBut the food is at (6,1) or (1,6).\n\n(6,1) is southeast, (1,6) northwest.\n\nFrom (4,3), I can go down to (4,2), then right to (5,2), then down to (5,1), then right to (6,1), but that might take more turns.\n\nTurn 18: move L to (4,3)\n\nTurn 19: from (4,3) move D to (4,2)\n\nThen positions: new head (4,2), direction down.\n\nPositions: previous [ (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5) ]\n\nAfter move to (4,2):\n\n- New head: (4,2)\n\n- Index 1 moves to (4,3)\n\n- Index 2 moves to (5,3)\n\n- Index 3 moves to (5,4)\n\n- Index 4 moves to (6,4)\n\n- Index 5 moves to (6,5)\n\n- Tail moves to (5,5)?

(6,2) not in positions, should be free.\n\nRight invalid, up to (6,2) possible.\n\nThen I can go up to (6,2), then left to (5,2) but occupied, or up to (6,3), etc.\n\nFrom (6,1) move U to (6,2) on turn 23.\n\nThen similar to before, I can move up.\n\nBut still, the area is crowded.\n\nTo have more space, I should consider going for the other food first or taking a path that opens up the board.\n\nBut the other food at (1,6) has longer life span, 8 turns, so I can eat (6,1) first and then go to (1,6).\n\nBut after eating (6,1), I need to escape the bottom.\n\nIn the first path, when I ate on turn 20, I was at (6,1), then moved left to (5,1) on turn 21, then up to (5,2) on turn 22, then left to (4,2) on turn 23, and so on.\n\nFrom (4,2), I can go to (4,1), (3,2), (4,3), etc.\n\n(4,3) might be free.\n\nThen I can head north and west towards (1,6).\n\nFor example, from (4,2) go to (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), then up to (1,3), etc., but (1,6) is at y=6.\n\ny=6 is not wall, but there is internal obstacle at (4,6), so y=6 is playable except (4,6).\n\nSo from (1,2) to (1,6) is possible.\n\nBut it takes many turns.\n\nSince I need to output a sequence, I should choose a path that allows me to eat both foods eventually.\n\nBut (6,1) must be eaten soon.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 18, move down to (5,2), then on turn 19 move down to (5,1), then on turn 20 move right to (6,1) to eat, as before.\n\nBut after that, instead of moving left, since I have more space on the left, I can move up from (6,1) but only if I can, but in that position, only left is possible.\n\nUnless I approach (6,1) from above or something.\n\nFor example, from (5,3) on turn 18, move right to (6,3), then on turn 19, as before, only down to (6,2), then on turn 20 down to (6,1).\n\nBut on turn 19, from (6,3) to (6,2), then from (6,2), I could go left to (5,2) instead of down, but then I don't eat the food immediately.\n\nTurn 18: move R to (6,3)\n\nPositions: [ (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5) ] as earlier.\n\nTurn 19: from (6,3) move D to (6,2)\n\nPositions: [ (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) ]\n\nNow head at (6,2), direction down.\n\nInstead of moving down to (6,1), I can move left to (5,2) or right invalid.\n\n(5,2) is free.\n\nMove L to (5,2) on turn 20.\n\nThen new head (5,2), direction left.\n\nPositions: previous [ (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) ]\n\nAfter move to (5,2):\n\n- New head: (5,2)\n\n- Index 1 moves to (6,2)\n\n- Index 2 moves to (6,3)\n\n- Index 3 moves to (5,3)\n\n- Index 4 moves to (5,4)\n\n- Index 5 moves to (6,4)\n\n- Tail moves to (6,5)  // old index 5 position\n\nNew positions: [ (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4) ] tail at (6,4)\n\nHead at (5,2), can move down to (5,1), left to (4,2), up to (5,3) occupied, right to (6,2) occupied.\n\nSo down or left.\n\nIf I move down to (5,1) on turn 21, then to (6,1) on turn 22 to eat food.\n\nTurn 21: move D to (5,1)\n\nNew head (5,1), direction down.\n\nPositions: [ (5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4) ] tail at (5,4)? After move:\n\nPrevious: [ (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4) ]\n\nMove to (5,1):\n\n- New head: (5,1)\n\n- Index 1 moves to (5,2)\n\n- Index 2 moves to (6,2)\n\n- Index 3 moves to (6,3)\n\n- Index 4 moves to (5,3)\n\n- Index 5 moves to (5,4)\n\n- Tail moves to (6,4)\n\nNew positions: [ (5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4) ] tail at (5,4)\n\nTurn 22: move R to (6,1) eat food.\n\n(6,1) free, move right from (5,1) to (6,1).\n\nNew head (6,1), eat.\n\nPositions before move: [ (5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4) ]\n\nAfter move to (6,1):\n\n- New head: (6,1)\n\n- Index 1 moves to (5,1)\n\n- Index 2 moves to (5,2)\n\n- Index 3 moves to (6,2)\n\n- Index 4 moves to (6,3)\n\n- Index 5 moves to (5,3)\n\n- Index 6 moves to (5,4)  // new segment\n\nNew positions: [ (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4) ]\n\nHead at (6,1), direction right.\n\nCan move up to (6,2) but (6,2) is body, occupied, cannot.\n\nLeft to (5,1) occupied.\n\nDown invalid.\n\nSo no move! Stuck, and only left was possible but occupied, so I die.\n\nProblem!\n\nIn this case, after eating at (6,1), (6,2) is occupied by body, so I cannot move up, and left and down occupied or invalid, so I have no valid move, collision or wall.\n\nSpecifically, from (6,1), up to (6,2) is body, left to (5,1) body, down to (6,0) wall, right to (7,1) wall. So no possible move, snake dies.\n\nThis is bad.\n\nTherefore, I cannot eat the food when I am trapped like this.\n\nIn the first approach, when I ate on turn 20, I had a move to (5,1) because (6,2) was not occupied yet, but in this delayed eating, (6,2) is occupied.\n\nIn the direct path, when I ate on turn 20, positions were [ (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) ] so from (6,1), I could move left to (5,1) which was free.\n\nWhereas in the delayed eating, when I ate on turn 22, (6,2) and (5,1) were occupied, no escape.\n\nSo to eat (6,1), I need to do it early and from a direction that leaves an escape route.\n\nIn the first plan, with turn 18 R, 19 D, 20 D to eat, then turn 21 L to (5,1), it was possible.\n\nThen from there, I can move to open areas.\n\nSimilarly, with the left first approach, when I ate on turn 22, I had positions with (5,1) free, so I could move left or up.\n\nIn the turn 22 eating via left path, after eating at (6,1), positions [ (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4) ], so from (6,1), I can move up to (6,2) which is free? (6,2) is in the list? New positions: (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), so (6,2) not occupied, so I can move up to (6,2).\n\nThen to (6,3), etc.\n\nSo it is possible.\n\nBut to maximize long-term, I should eat (6,1) soon and then head to (1,6).\n\nSince (6,1) life span short, I should prioritize it.\n\nAlso, for long-term survival, after eating, I need to go to open spaces.\n\nNow, the grid has an internal obstacle at (4,6), which might block paths to (1,6).\n\n(1,6) is at top-left.\n\nCurrent head at (5,3), after eating (6,1), I can go left and up.\n\nBut let's plan the sequence.\n\nI think the safest is to eat (6,1) directly and early.\n\nSo turn 18: move R to (6,3)\n\nTurn 19: move D to (6,2)\n\nTurn 20: move D to (6,1) eat food.\n\nThen turn 21: move L to (5,1)  // only choice\n\nTurn 22: from (5,1) move U to (5,2)  // as earlier, after move to (5,1), positions allow (5,2) free\n\nIn turn 21: after moving to (5,1), positions [ (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4) ] tail at (6,4)\n\nHead at (5,1), direction left (since moved left from (6,1)).\n\nCan move U to (5,2), D invalid, L to (4,1), R to (6,1) occupied.\n\n(5,2) free, (4,1) free.\n\nSo move U to (5,2) on turn 22.\n\nThen from (5,2), as before, only L to (4,2) possible, since U to (5,3) occupied, R to (6,2) occupied, D to (5,1) occupied.\n\nIn positions after turn 21: [ (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4) ]\n\nAfter move to (5,2) on turn 22:\n\n- New head: (5,2)\n\n- Index 1 moves to (5,1)\n\n- Index 2 moves to (6,1)\n\n- Index 3 moves to (6,2)\n\n- Index 4 moves to (6,3)\n\n- Index 5 moves to (5,3)\n\n- Index 6 moves to (5,4)\n\n- Tail moves to (6,4)  // old index 6 position\n\nNew positions: [ (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4) ] tail at (5,4)\n\nHead at (5,2), can move L to (4,2), U to (5,3) occupied, R to (6,2) occupied, D to (5,1) occupied.\n\nSo only L to (4,2).\n\nTurn 23: move L to (4,2)\n\nThen from there, I can go to (4,1), (3,2), (4,3), etc.\n\nTo reach (1,6), I can go left to (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), then up to (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), but it will take many turns.\n\n(1,6) has life span 8 at turn 18, so by turn 25 it disappears. Turn 18 to 25, 8 turns, but I can eat on turn 25 if life span 1.\n\nAt turn 23, I am at (4,2), (1,6) is at distance |4-1|=3 x, |2-6|=4 y, so 7 steps, but I have turns 23,24,25 to move, 3 turns, not enough to reach directly, since min steps 7.\n\nManhattan distance from (4,2) to (1,6) is |4-1| + |2-6| = 3 + 4 = 7.\n\nBut I need to move around the body, so might take more.\n\nAt turn 23, food life span: at turn 18, life span 8, turn 19:7, turn20:6, turn21:5, turn22:4, turn23:3, turn24:2, turn25:1, turn26:0 gone. So must eat by turn 25.\n\nAt turn 23, I am at (4,2), to (1,6) in 3 moves: impossible, min 7 moves.\n\nSo I cannot reach (1,6) in time if I eat (6,1) first.\n\nBut if I go for (1,6) first, it has longer life, but (6,1) has short life.\n\nAt turn 18, from (5,3), if I go towards (1,6), it is far.\n\nFor example, move L to (4,3) on turn 18, then to (4,4), (4,5), but (4,5) was tail, now free, but I can go to (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), then to (1,6).\n\nBut let's see.\n\nTurn 18: move L to (4,3)\n\nPositions: [ (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5) ]\n\nTurn 19: move U to (4,4)  // up to (4,4)\n\nDirection after left move is left, so can move U, D, L, not R.\n\n(4,4) free.\n\nNew head (4,4), direction up.\n\nPositions: [ (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) ] tail at (6,5)\n\nTurn 20: move U to (4,5)  // up to (4,5)\n\n(4,5) was tail, but now free, so ok.\n\nNew head (4,5), direction up.\n\nPositions: [ (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4) ] tail at (6,4)\n\nTurn 21: move L to (3,5)  // left to (3,5)\n\nDirection up, moving left allowed.\n\n(3,5) free.\n\nNew head (3,5), direction left.\n\nPositions: [ (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4) ] tail at (5,4)\n\nTurn 22: move L to (2,5)\n\nNew head (2,5), direction left.\n\nPositions: [ (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (5,3) ] tail at (5,3)\n\nTurn 23: move L to (1,5)\n\nNew head (1,5), direction left.\n\nPositions: [ (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3) ] tail at (4,3)\n\nTurn 24: move U to (1,6) to eat food.\n\n(1,6) free, move up from (1,5) to (1,6).\n\nEat food.\n\nBut (6,1) has life span 5 at turn 18, so at turn 24, it has been 6 turns, life span decreased to 5-6= -1? Turn 18:5, turn19:4, turn20:3, turn21:2, turn22:1, turn23:0, so at turn 23 it disappears. So on turn 24, (6,1) is gone, so I can only eat (1,6).\n\nI ate (1,6) on turn 24.\n\nBut I missed (6,1), which had value +1, so I lost that score.\n\nBut for survival, I have a longer snake, but I missed one food.\n\nSince both are +1, eating both is better, but I can't because of distance and time.\n\nIn this path, I ate (1,6) on turn 24, and (6,1) expired.\n\nBut at turn 18, I could go to (6,1) first, but then I can't reach (1,6) in time.\n\nSo I have to choose one.\n\nBut (6,1) is closer, so I can eat it and have a point, then survive, and (1,6) might be eaten if I can, but I can't reach in time.\n\nPerhaps after eating (6,1), I can go towards the center or open area.\n\nBut for scoring, eating one is better than none, but I can eat at least one.\n\nAnother thought: is there a way to eat both?\n\nFor example, if I eat (6,1) quickly, then move fast to (1,6).\n\nBut from (6,1) to (1,6) is |6-1| + |1-6| = 5+5=10 distance, at turn 20 after eating, to turn 25, 6 moves, min 10 steps, not possible.\n\nAt turn 20, food (1,6) life span at turn 18 is 8, turn 19:7, turn20:6, turn21:5, turn22:4, turn23:3, turn24:2, turn25:1, so must eat by turn 25.\n\nFrom turn 20 to 25, 5 moves, min distance 10, impossible.\n\nSimilarly, if I go for (1,6) first, I eat on turn 24, (6,1) expired.\n\nSo I can only eat one of them.\n\nSince both are +1, it doesn't matter which one, but (6,1) is closer, so I can eat it with fewer moves, less risk.\n\nAlso, after eating (6,1), I am at bottom, but I can navigate to open space.\n\nFor example, after eating (6,1) at turn 20, move to (5,1) on 21, (5,2) on 22, (4,2) on 23, then to (4,1), (3,1), etc., and survive.\n\nWhereas if I go for (1,6), I have to go through the top, and there is obstacle at (4,6), but not in the way.\n\nIn the (1,6) path, I ended at (1,6) on turn 24, with the snake.\n\nBut for the sequence, I need to output actions for several turns.\n\nThe answer should be for turns 18,19,20, etc.\n\nSince I think 5+ turns, I can output a sequence.\n\nBut to be safe, I'll go for (6,1) first.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 18: move R to (6,3)\n\nTurn 19: move D to (6,2)\n\nTurn 20: move D to (6,1) eat food.\n\nThen turn 21: move L to (5,1)\n\nTurn 22: move U to (5,2)  // from (5,1) to (5,2)\n\nThen turn 23: move L to (4,2)\n\nFrom there, I can continue, but I need to specify.\n\nSince the food is eaten, and no other food, I can move to open cells.\n\nFor example, from (4,2), move to (4,1) or (3,2), etc.\n\nBut for the answer, I can put up to turn 23 or so.\n\nThe core is to eat the food safely.\n\nAnother option: at turn 18, move down to (5,2), then turn 19 move right to (6,2), turn 20 move down to (6,1) eat, same as first.\n\nOr turn 18 move down to (5,2), turn 19 move down to (5,1), turn 20 move right to (6,1) eat.\n\nIn this case, after eating, head at (6,1), then turn 21 move left to (5,1), but (5,1) is occupied? After turn 20 eat, positions depend on how I came.\n\nIf I came via (5,1) to (6,1), then after eating, positions: [ (6,1), (5,1), ... ] so from (6,1), moving left to (5,1) is occupied, so I cannot.\n\nIn this path: turn 18: move D to (5,2)\n\nPositions: [ (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5) ]\n\nTurn 19: move D to (5,1)\n\nPositions: [ (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) ]\n\nTurn 20: move R to (6,1) eat\n\nNew positions: [ (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) ]  // after growth\n\nNow head at (6,1), can move up to (6,2) free? (6,2) not occupied, free.\n\nLeft to (5,1) occupied.\n\nDown invalid.\n\nRight invalid.\n\nSo move U to (6,2) on turn 21.\n\nThen to (6,3), etc.\n\nSo escape is possible.\n\nIn this case, after eating, I can move up.\n\nSimilarly, in the first path, I could move up if I approach properly.\n\nBut in the output, I can choose one.\n\nI think the sequence with turn 18 R, 19 D, 20 D is fine.\n\nThen for turn 21 L, 22 U, 23 L.\n\nBut to have a complete sequence, let's say up to turn 23.\n\nSince the other food is not reachable, I can stop after eating and escaping.\n\nFor the answer format, I need to box the actions.\n\nSo for turn 18: R\n\nTurn 19: D\n\nTurn 20: D\n\nThen turn 21: L (to (5,1))\n\nTurn 22: U (to (5,2))\n\nTurn 23: L (to (4,2))\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut turn 23 is t1+5=18+5=23.\n\nt1=18.\n\nSo I can output up to turn 23.\n\nTo think 5 turns ahead, from turn 18 to 23 is 5 actions? Turns: action on turn 18,19,20,21,22,23, that's 6 turns.\n\nTurn 18,19,20,21,22: 5 turns ahead.\n\nTurn 18 is current, so actions for turn 18 to 22 or 23.\n\nThe sequence includes turn t1.\n\n\"Think 5+ turns ahead\" means plan for at least 5 future states, so actions for turn 18 to 22 or more.\n\nI think output for 5 actions is fine.\n\nSo let's finalize.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating the positive food at (6,1) while ensuring long-term survival, the plan prioritizes reaching this food quickly due to its short remaining life span (5 turns, disappearing after turn 22). The food at (1,6) has a longer life span (8 turns) but is too far to reach after eating (6,1) within its life span, so it is not targeted. The sequence avoids collisions and dead ends by moving efficiently and escaping the bottom-right corner after eating.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Food at (6,1)**: Must be eaten by turn 22. Direct path: (5,3) → (6,3) → (6,2) → (6,1) in 3 turns.\n- **Escape after eating**: After eating at (6,1), the head is at risk of being trapped. Moving left to (5,1) and then up to (5,2) opens space to the left for long-term survival.\n- **Collision avoidance**: The body positions are tracked to prevent collisions. For example, after moving to (6,1), (6,2) and (5,1) become body segments, but (5,1) is free when moving from (6,1) early.\n- **5+ turns planned**: Sequence covers turns 18 to 23 (6 turns) to ensure the food is eaten and the snake navigates to safer areas.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 18 (current)**: Move right (R) to (6,3). This starts the path toward (6,1) and avoids immediate body collisions. Direction changes to right.\n- **Turn 19**: Move down (D) to (6,2). Only safe move; right is blocked by wall, left leads to body collision. Direction changes to down.\n- **Turn 20**: Move down (D) to (6,1) to eat the food (+1 score, snake length increases to 7). Direction changes to down.\n- **Turn 21**: Move left (L) to (5,1). Only safe move; up and right are blocked by body, down is wall. Direction changes to left.\n- **Turn 22**: Move up (U) to (5,2). Opens space; left and down are blocked, right is body. Direction changes to up.\n- **Turn 23**: Move left (L) to (4,2). Continues toward open left side for long-term survival; up is blocked by body, right and down are blocked.\n\n### Why this sequence?\n- **Efficiency**: Eats (6,1) by turn 20 with minimal moves.\n- **Survival**: After eating, escaping to (4,2) by turn 23 avoids dead ends. From (4,2), the snake can navigate to open cells like (4,1), (3,2), or (4,3) for future turns.\n- **Risk mitigation**: No tail reward danger (food not near tail), and internal obstacle at (4,6) is avoided. The path ensures the head never reverses direction instantly.\n- **Long-term**: By turn 23, the snake is in a less constrained area, allowing flexibility to avoid future risks. Missing (1,6) is unavoidable due to distance, but the +1 score from (6,1) is secured.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 18\\text{: R} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19\\text{: D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20\\text{: D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 21\\text{: L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 22\\text{: U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 23\\text{: L} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 19. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (4,6). So, I should visualize the grid.\n\nThe grid is from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid. Walls are on the borders, meaning I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, (4,6) is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (6,3), then body segments: (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5). Head direction is right, so it was moving right to (6,3) from previous position. Let's list the snake segments in order:\n\n- Head: (6,3)\n\n- Segment 1: (5,3)\n\n- Segment 2: (5,4)\n\n- Segment 3: (6,4)\n\n- Segment 4: (6,5)\n\n- Segment 5: (5,5)  // this is the tail\n\n(5,5) is the last segment, so tail is at (5,5).\n\nFood items:\n\n- (6,1) with value 1 and life span 4. Since current turn is 19, it disappears after 4 turns, so on turn 23 it will be gone? Life span decreases each turn, including current, so if it has life span 4 on turn 19, it will last until turn 22? Let me think.\n\nLife span: it says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So on turn t, if food has life span L, it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears after turn t+L-1, so not available on turn t+L.\n\nFor (6,1): life span 4 at turn 19. So it can be eaten on turns 19, 20, 21, 22. Disappears after turn 22, so not there on turn 23.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6): life span 7, so available from turn 19 to 25? Life span 7 at turn 19: turns 19 to 19+7-1=25, so turns 19 to 25 inclusive.\n\nTurn 19: life span decreases to 6? No.\n\nThe state says \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value\" at current turn t=19.\n\nFor (6,1): life span 4, meaning it has 4 turns left including this one. So after this turn, if not eaten, life span becomes 3, and so on, until 0.\n\nBut for eating, it can be eaten as long as life span >0. So on turn when life span is L, it can be eaten, and then life span decreases each turn.\n\nSo for (6,1): life span 4 on turn 19, so it can be eaten on turn 19, 20, 21, 22. On turn 23, life span would be 0, so gone.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6): life span 7 on turn 19, so available turns 19 to 25.\n\n(5,6): life span 10 on turn 19, available turns 19 to 28.\n\nAll food have value +1, so all are positive food. No negative food here.\n\nNow, snake head at (6,3), direction right. So from previous move, it came from left, since (5,3) is left of head.\n\nCurrent head direction is R, meaning it was moving right to (6,3).\n\nPossible moves: I can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), but cannot reverse instantly. Since direction is R, reverse would be L, so I cannot move left immediately.\n\nMovement constraints: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n\nSo current direction is R, so I cannot move L on this turn.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, R. L is not allowed.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 are inside, but y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6.\n\nx=0, x=7 walls; y=0, y=7 walls. So the accessible cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is at x=4, y=6. y=6 is the top wall? y=7 is wall, y=0 wall, so y=1 to 6 is bottom to top? Let's define coordinates.\n\nTypically, y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top, I assume. But in the state, it says y=0 and y=7 are borders, so probably y=0 is bottom wall, y=7 is top wall.\n\nSimilarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nSo playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nNow, (4,6) is an obstacle, so it's blocked.\n\ny=6 is the top row, since y=7 is wall.\n\ny=1 to 6: y=1 bottom, y=6 top? y=0 is wall, so y=1 is the first row, y=6 is the last row before y=7 wall.\n\nSimilarly, x=1 to 6.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), which is on the top row, x=4, y=6.\n\nNow snake positions:\n\nHead: (6,3)\n\nBody: (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)\n\nLet's plot this on a grid.\n\nGrid rows y=1 to 6, columns x=1 to 6.\n\ny=1 bottom, y=6 top? Or y=1 top? I need to be consistent.\n\nIn coordinates, usually (x,y), with y increasing up or down? The state doesn't specify, but in the movement, U is (x,y+1), so y increases up, I think. U (up) is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, so y=1 is bottom, y=6 is top, since y=7 is wall.\n\nSimilarly, D (down) is (x,y-1), so decreasing y.\n\nL (left) is (x-1,y), R (right) is (x+1,y).\n\nSo, for example, from (6,3), U to (6,4), D to (6,2), L to (5,3), R to (7,3) but x=7 is wall, so cannot move R.\n\nx=7 is wall, so from (6,3), moving R to (7,3) is invalid, wall.\n\nSimilarly, moving U to (6,4) might be possible, but let's see what's there.\n\nFirst, list all occupied cells by snake.\n\nSnake segments:\n\n- (6,3): head\n\n- (5,3)\n\n- (5,4)\n\n- (6,4)\n\n- (6,5)\n\n- (5,5): tail\n\nSo positions: (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)\n\nNow, food:\n\n- (6,1): value 1, life span 4 (turns 19-22)\n\n- (1,6): value 1, life span 7 (turns 19-25)\n\n- (5,6): value 1, life span 10 (turns 19-28)\n\n(5,6) is at x=5, y=6. y=6 is the top row. But (4,6) is an obstacle, so (5,6) is accessible? (4,6) is obstacle, but (5,6) is different cell.\n\nAlso, (1,6) is x=1, y=6.\n\nNow, current head at (6,3), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, R, but not L because reverse not allowed.\n\nR to (7,3): x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n\nSo only possible: U or D.\n\nU to (6,4): what is at (6,4)? From snake positions, (6,4) is a body segment. But is it occupied now?\n\nSnake positions: (6,4) is the fourth segment. When the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves, so the body segment at (6,4) will move to the next position when the snake moves.\n\nI need to think about the next state.\n\nFor collision: if head moves to a cell occupied by a body segment, it collides, except if it's the tail and the tail moves away.\n\nSpecifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, when moving, if the head moves to a cell that is not the tail, and that cell is occupied by body, it collides. But if it moves to the tail cell, it's ok because the tail will move.\n\nIn this case, for move to (6,4): (6,4) is currently occupied by a body segment, but it's not the tail. Tail is at (5,5).\n\nSo if head moves to (6,4), which is occupied by a body part, it will collide and die.\n\nSimilarly, other cells.\n\nLet's list possible moves from (6,3):\n\n- U: to (6,4)\n\n- D: to (6,2)\n\n- R: to (7,3) — wall, invalid\n\n- L: to (5,3) — but reverse not allowed, since current direction R, L is opposite, so invalid.\n\nSo only U or D possible.\n\nNow, U to (6,4): (6,4) is occupied by a body segment (the fourth segment), which is not the tail. So if head moves there, it collides with body, die.\n\nD to (6,2): what is at (6,2)? From snake positions, (6,2) is not listed, so it might be empty or food.\n\nFood is at (6,1), not (6,2). So (6,2) should be empty.\n\nAlso, is it within bounds? x=6, y=2: x=6 is ok, since x=1 to 6, x=6 is not wall? Walls are x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to 6 are accessible, similarly y=1 to 6.\n\ny=2 is within 1 to 6, so (6,2) is empty and accessible.\n\nSo only possible safe move is D to (6,2).\n\nIs that right? U to (6,4) is body, so collision, invalid.\n\nR to (7,3) wall, invalid.\n\nL to (5,3) is reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo only D to (6,2) is possible.\n\nBut let's confirm the snake body.\n\nAfter moving to (6,2), what happens?\n\nThe head moves to (6,2), and the tail moves. The snake has 6 segments, so after moving, the new head is at (6,2), and the tail is removed from (5,5), so the new snake will be: [(6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)]? Let's see the order.\n\nOriginal positions: head (6,3), then (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)\n\nWhen head moves to a new cell, the body follows.\n\nSo if head moves to (6,2), new head is (6,2), then the body: the first body segment was at (5,3), which becomes the new position for what was behind head, but since head moved to (6,2), the segment that was at (6,3) becomes the first body segment, and so on.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, that becomes the new head, and the tail cell is removed, unless food is eaten.\n\nIn this case, no food at (6,2), so tail is removed.\n\nNew snake positions: head moves to (6,2), so new head (6,2)\n\nThen, the previous head (6,3) becomes the first body segment.\n\nThen (5,3) becomes second body segment.\n\nThen (5,4) third.\n\nThen (6,4) fourth.\n\nThen (6,5) fifth.\n\nAnd tail (5,5) is removed.\n\nSo new snake: [(6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)]\n\nTail is at (6,5).\n\nNow, after this move, on turn 20, I need to think ahead.\n\nBut for now, on turn 19, only D to (6,2) is possible? What about other moves?\n\nU to (6,4) is occupied by body, collision.\n\nUnless it's the tail, but it's not the tail, tail is (5,5).\n\n(6,4) is a middle segment, so definitely collision.\n\nSimilarly, no other moves.\n\nSo I must move down to (6,2) on turn 19.\n\nThen, for turn 20, head at (6,2), and direction: since I moved down, new head direction is D.\n\nNow, I need to plan multiple turns.\n\nThe answer format requires actions for several turns, at least 5+ turns ahead.\n\nSince I have to move D now, let's start from there.\n\nTurn 19: action D (down) to (6,2)\n\nNow turn 20: snake positions: head (6,2), body: (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) tail at (6,5)\n\nHead direction: down, since I moved down.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut cannot reverse, so cannot move up (U), since reverse of down.\n\nReverse of down is up, so cannot move U.\n\nPossible: D (down), L (left), R (right).\n\nR to (7,2): x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nL to (5,2): what is there? Not occupied by snake, I think. Snake positions: (6,2) head, (6,3), (5,3), etc., no (5,2), so empty.\n\nD to (6,1): what is there? (6,1) has food! Value 1, life span 4 at turn 19, but on turn 20, life span decreases to 3, but still there.\n\n(6,1) has food, and it's within bounds.\n\nSo possible moves:\n\n- D to (6,1): which has food\n\n- L to (5,2): empty\n\n- U: invalid, reverse\n\n- R: invalid, wall\n\nSo I can move D to (6,1) or L to (5,2).\n\nIf I move D to (6,1), I eat the food. Since it's positive food, snake length increases by 1, and I get +1 score.\n\nWhen food is eaten, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n\nSpecifically: when head moves to food cell, if it's positive food, length increases, tail stays, so new segment added.\n\nIn this case, if head moves to (6,1), which is food, value +1, so snake grows.\n\nNew head at (6,1), and the tail is not removed, so new snake positions: head (6,1), then previous head (6,2) becomes body, then (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) — and since food eaten, tail remains, so the segment that was tail (6,5) is still there, and we add a new segment? No.\n\nStandard: when food eaten, the head moves to food, and a new segment is added at the tail position, but since tail doesn't move, the snake grows from the tail.\n\nIn terms of positions: the snake body remains as is, and head moves to new cell, so the length increases by one.\n\nFor example, original snake: positions S0, S1, ..., S5 (6 segments).\n\nHead moves to new cell, say F, which is food. Then new snake: [F, S0, S1, S2, S3, S4, S5] — now 7 segments, with tail S5.\n\nIn this case, original before move: head (6,2), body (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) tail.\n\nAfter move to (6,1) with food: new head (6,1), then (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) — tail still (6,5), but now there are 7 segments? Original was 6 segments, after growth, 7.\n\nPositions: before move, segments: index 0: (6,2) head, index 1: (6,3), index 2: (5,3), index 3: (5,4), index 4: (6,4), index 5: (6,5) tail.\n\nAfter moving head to (6,1) and eating food: new head is (6,1), and the body is the previous positions, so [ (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) ] — so tail is still (6,5), but now 7 segments.\n\nThe cell (6,5) is still occupied, but it's the tail.\n\nIf I don't eat food, move to (5,2), then new snake: head (5,2), then (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4) — tail (6,4), and (6,5) removed.\n\nBack to turn 20 choice.\n\nI can move D to (6,1) and eat food, or L to (5,2) empty.\n\nIf I eat food, I grow, which might make it harder to maneuver later, but I get score.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nAlso, there is a food at (5,6) and (1,6), which are both at y=6, top row.\n\n(5,6) is above the tail or something.\n\nCurrent after turn 19 move, we have snake at turn 20 if I moved D on 19.\n\nBut on turn 19, I must move D, so let's assume that.\n\nThen turn 20, I have options.\n\nFirst, let's list food life spans at turn 20.\n\nAfter turn 19, if I move D to (6,2), no food eaten, so food still there.\n\nFood at turn 19:\n\n- (6,1): life span 4, so on turn 20, if not eaten, life span 3\n\n- (1,6): life span 7, turn 20 life span 6\n\n- (5,6): life span 10, turn 20 life span 9\n\nIf on turn 20 I move to (6,1), I eat it.\n\nOtherwise, it remains.\n\nNow, for long-term, I should consider getting other food.\n\nAlso, the grid has limited space, and snake is long.\n\nAnother thing: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (6,5), and food at (5,6) is near, but (5,6) is not on tail cell.\n\nTail is at (6,5), food at (5,6) is adjacent, but not on tail.\n\nIf I eat food on tail cell, it might be dangerous.\n\nBut here, no food on tail.\n\nFirst, on turn 20, if I move D to (6,1), I eat food, grow to 7 segments, and head at (6,1), direction down.\n\nThen possible next moves.\n\nIf I move L to (5,2), no growth, head at (5,2), direction left? Let's see.\n\nSince on turn 19 I must move D, and on turn 20 I can choose to eat or not.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should eat if safe, but need to think about future.\n\nLet's think 5 turns ahead.\n\nFirst, from current state turn 19: only possible move is D to (6,2), so:\n\nTurn 19: D\n\nNow turn 20: snake at [(6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)] tail at (6,5)\n\nHead direction: D (down)\n\nPossible moves: D to (6,1), L to (5,2), R to (7,2) invalid, U invalid (reverse).\n\nSo D or L.\n\nIf I move D to (6,1): eat food, grow. New snake: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)] 7 segments, tail (6,5)\n\nHead direction down.\n\nThen turn 21: from (6,1), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nCannot move U, reverse of down? Reverse of down is up, so cannot move U.\n\nD to (6,0): y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nL to (5,1)\n\nR to (7,1) wall invalid.\n\nSo only possible move L to (5,1)? What is at (5,1)? Not occupied, I think, so empty.\n\n(5,1) should be accessible.\n\nSo from (6,1), only move L to (5,1).\n\nThen after moving, no food, so new snake: head (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4) — tail (6,4), since last segment (6,5) removed? When no food eaten, tail moves.\n\nAfter turn 20: snake with 7 segments: positions: 0:(6,1), 1:(6,2), 2:(6,3), 3:(5,3), 4:(5,4), 5:(6,4), 6:(6,5) tail\n\nMove to (5,1) no food: new head (5,1), then body: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4) — tail (6,4), and (6,5) removed.\n\nSo new snake: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)] tail at (6,4)\n\nHead direction: moved left, so direction L.\n\nNow, from (5,1), I need to move on turn 22.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nCannot reverse, so since direction L, cannot move R.\n\nReverse of left is right, so cannot move R.\n\nU to (5,2): empty?\n\nD to (5,0): y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nL to (4,1)\n\nR: invalid\n\nSo possible: U to (5,2) or L to (4,1)\n\n(5,2) might be empty, (4,1) empty.\n\nThen continue, but this is getting messy, and I have other food to consider.\n\nIf on turn 20, instead of eating food, I move L to (5,2).\n\nThen on turn 20: move L to (5,2), no food, so snake: head (5,2), then (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4) — tail (6,4), and (6,5) removed.\n\nNew snake: [(5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)] tail (6,4)\n\nHead direction left.\n\nThen turn 21: from (5,2), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nCannot move R (reverse).\n\nL to (4,2)\n\nU to (5,3) — but (5,3) is occupied by body! From positions, (5,3) is the third segment, not tail.\n\nTail is (6,4).\n\nIf move U to (5,3), collision with body.\n\nD to (5,1)\n\nR: invalid\n\nSo possible: L to (4,2) or D to (5,1)\n\nBoth might be empty.\n\nIf move L to (4,2), or D to (5,1).\n\nBut I need to get to other food.\n\nFood at (1,6) and (5,6) are at top row.\n\n(5,6) is at x=5, y=6, which is above (5,5) or something.\n\nAlso, there is an obstacle at (4,6), so (5,6) is accessible.\n\nNow, the tail is at (6,4) or where, depending.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should eat the food at (6,1) since it has short life span, only until turn 22.\n\nIf I don't eat it now, I might lose it.\n\nBut on turn 20, if I move to (5,2), then from there, I can still go down to (5,1) or left, but (6,1) is below, so I might not get back in time.\n\nFor example, from (5,2), I can go D to (5,1), then from (5,1), I can go L to (4,1) or U to (5,2) but (5,2) is previous, not good.\n\nLet's list coordinates.\n\nAssume y=1 bottom, y=6 top.\n\nSo (6,1) is bottom right.\n\n(5,6) top at x=5.\n\n(1,6) top left.\n\nFrom current, after turn 19 move, head at (6,2).\n\nIf on turn 20 I eat at (6,1), I grow, then I am stuck at bottom, only can go left to (5,1), then from (5,1), I can go up or left.\n\nBut the other food are at top, so I need to go up.\n\nSimilarly, if I don't eat, I am at (5,2), which is closer to center, can go up.\n\nBut (6,1) food will disappear soon, so I should eat it if possible.\n\nOn turn 20, if I move to (6,1), I eat it, good.\n\nIf I move to (5,2), then on turn 21, from (5,2), I can move to (5,1) or (4,2), but not to (6,1) directly, since from (5,2), to go to (6,1) is not adjacent, (6,1) is down-right, not adjacent directly.\n\nAdjacent cells are up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n\nFrom (5,2), adjacent: (5,3) up, but occupied or not; (5,1) down; (4,2) left; (6,2) right but that's the previous position, not available.\n\n(6,2) is body segment now.\n\nIn the snake, after moving to (5,2), positions: (5,2) head, (6,2) body, (6,3) body, etc.\n\nSo (5,3) is body, occupied.\n\nSo from (5,2), I can move to (5,1) or (4,2), not to (6,1).\n\n(6,1) is at (6,1), from (5,2) it's not adjacent, so I can't reach it in one move.\n\nTo reach (6,1) from (5,2), I need to go to (5,1) or (6,2) but (6,2) occupied, so only via (5,1), then from (5,1) to (6,1).\n\nBut from (5,1) to (6,1) is right, which might be possible.\n\nBut on turn 21, if I am at (5,2), I can move to (5,1), then turn 22 from (5,1) move to (6,1), but on turn 22, food at (6,1) has life span: at turn 20, if not eaten, life span 3, so on turn 22, life span 1, still available, but on turn 23 gone.\n\nIf on turn 20 I move to (5,2), turn 21 move to (5,1), turn 22 move to (6,1), then on turn 22 I can eat it.\n\nBut on turn 22, if I eat, it's still within life span.\n\nBut during this, I am not eating other food.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nFirst, for turn 19, I have to move D.\n\nTurn 19: D to (6,2)\n\nNow for turn 20, I have two choices: eat at (6,1) or move to (5,2)\n\nIf I eat at (6,1) on turn 20, I get the food immediately, and then I am at (6,1) with longer snake.\n\nIf I move to (5,2), I can potentially go to other areas, but I might still eat (6,1) later.\n\nBut let's think about the top food.\n\nFood at (5,6) has long life span, so not urgent.\n\n(1,6) also long.\n\nBut the snake is currently in the bottom right area.\n\nAnother thing: the tail is at (6,5), and food at (5,6) is adjacent, so I might be able to eat it if I can get the head there.\n\nBut with the current position, it's far.\n\nAlso, there is a risk of collision.\n\nMoreover, the internal obstacle at (4,6) might block paths.\n\nTo plan multiple turns, I should consider the available space.\n\nSince the grid is small, 6x6 playable area minus obstacles, and snake is 6 long, it's a bit crowded.\n\nPlayable cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to6, total 36 cells.\n\nObstacle at (4,6), so 35 cells.\n\nSnake occupies 6 cells, so 29 free.\n\nBut with food on some.\n\nFood at (6,1), (1,6), (5,6), so three food cells, but they are occupied by food, so free cells are 29 - 3 = 26? No, the food cells are free in the sense that snake can move there to eat, but they are occupied by food, not snake.\n\nAvailable for movement when not occupied.\n\nBut for pathing, the cells are there.\n\nNow, back to decision.\n\nOn turn 20, if I eat the food at (6,1), I grow to 7, and then I am at (6,1), with only one move possible: L to (5,1), as D and R and U invalid or occupied.\n\nThen from (5,1), I can go U to (5,2) or L to (4,1) or D to (5,0) invalid, so U or L.\n\nIf I go U to (5,2), then from (5,2), I can go U to (5,3) but (5,3) is occupied, or L to (4,2) or D to (5,1) but just came from, or R to (6,2) occupied.\n\nSo only L to (4,2) possible.\n\nThen from (4,2), and so on.\n\nThis might lead me to the left side.\n\nIf on turn 20 I move to (5,2) instead of eating, then I am at (5,2), with shorter snake, 6 segments, and I can go to (5,1) or (4,2).\n\nIf I go to (5,1), then I can go to (6,1) on next turn to eat, or to (5,0) invalid or (4,1).\n\nBut let's list a sequence.\n\nSince I need to provide actions for multiple turns, I should choose a path that allows me to eat multiple food.\n\nFor example, after eating (6,1), I can go left and up to get to (1,6) or (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is closer.\n\n(5,6) is at x=5, y=6.\n\nCurrent after turn 19 move, head at (6,2).\n\nIf I go to (5,2) on turn 20, then to (4,2), etc., but that might take time.\n\nAnother idea: the snake body has a loop, positions: (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5) before move.\n\nAfter move to (6,2), snake is (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nSo it forms a sort of U-shape or something.\n\nFrom (6,2), if I move L to (5,2), then head at (5,2), with body (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), tail (6,5)\n\nThen (5,3) is occupied, so I can move D to (5,1) or L to (4,2).\n\nIf I move to (5,1), then I can then move to (6,1) to eat on turn 21 or 22.\n\nBut let's calculate turns.\n\nTurn 19: D to (6,2) — no eat\n\nTurn 20: if I move L to (5,2) — no eat\n\nThen turn 21: from (5,2), I can move D to (5,1) — no eat, or L to (4,2)\n\nIf I move D to (5,1), then positions: head (5,1), body (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4) — tail (5,4)? Let's list.\n\nAfter turn 20: snake [(5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)] tail (6,4)\n\nMove to (5,1) no food: new head (5,1), then (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4) — tail (5,4), and (6,4) removed.\n\nNew snake: [(5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)] tail (5,4)\n\nHead direction down? Moved from (5,2) to (5,1), so down, direction D.\n\nThen turn 22: from (5,1), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nCannot move U (reverse).\n\nD to (5,0) invalid.\n\nL to (4,1)\n\nR to (6,1) — (6,1) has food.\n\nSo I can move R to (6,1) to eat, or L to (4,1).\n\nIf I move R to (6,1), I eat the food, grow.\n\nNew snake: head (6,1), then (5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4) — tail (5,4), and since food eaten, no removal, so new segment, but where? Positions: after move, new head at (6,1), body includes previous head (5,1), so [ (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4) ] — 7 segments, tail (5,4)\n\nThen head at (6,1), direction right (since moved right from (5,1)).\n\nThen turn 23: from (6,1), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nCannot move L (reverse).\n\nR to (7,1) wall invalid.\n\nD to (6,0) invalid.\n\nU to (6,2) — but (6,2) is occupied by body! (6,2) is the fourth segment.\n\nSo collision if move U to (6,2).\n\nOnly possible move? L to (5,1) but (5,1) is also body, the second segment.\n\nPositions: head (6,1), body (5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)\n\nSo (6,2) is occupied, (5,1) occupied, so no safe move! U to (6,2) body, D invalid, L to (5,1) body, R invalid. So stuck, die.\n\nProblem!\n\nIf I eat the food on turn 22 at (6,1), then on turn 23, from (6,1), all adjacent cells are invalid or occupied: up (6,2) body, down wall, left (5,1) body, right wall. So no move, die.\n\nTherefore, I cannot eat the food at (6,1) on turn 22 if I am at (5,1) before, because after eating, I am trapped.\n\nIf I eat earlier, on turn 20, from (6,2) move D to (6,1), eat, then on turn 21, from (6,1) move L to (5,1), no problem.\n\nThen from (5,1), I can move U or L.\n\nFor example, turn 21: move L to (5,1) from (6,1), so head at (5,1), direction left.\n\nThen turn 22: from (5,1), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,2), D to (5,0) invalid, L to (4,1), R to (6,1) but (6,1) is body now? After turn 21 move, snake is [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)] earlier after turn 20 eat, snake was [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)] tail (6,5)\n\nAfter move to (5,1) on turn 21 no eat: new head (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4) — tail (6,4), and (6,5) removed.\n\nSo positions: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)] tail (6,4)\n\nHead at (5,1), direction L.\n\nTurn 22: from (5,1), moves:\n\nU to (5,2): is it occupied? (5,2) not in positions, so empty.\n\nD to (5,0) invalid.\n\nL to (4,1): empty\n\nR to (6,1): occupied by body, first segment.\n\nSo can move U to (5,2) or L to (4,1).\n\nIf move U to (5,2), then new head (5,2), etc.\n\nNo immediate death.\n\nBut in the case where I ate on turn 22 from (5,1), I died.\n\nTherefore, to eat (6,1), it's better to do it earlier when possible, like on turn 20 directly from (6,2).\n\nThen I can survive and move left.\n\nMoreover, (6,1) has short life span, so I should eat it on turn 20.\n\nOn turn 19, I move D to (6,2), then turn 20 move D to (6,1) to eat.\n\nThen for turn 21, from (6,1), only move L to (5,1).\n\nTurn 21: move L to (5,1)\n\nThen turn 22, from (5,1), I can move U to (5,2) or L to (4,1)\n\nNow, I need to go towards other food.\n\nFood at (5,6) and (1,6).\n\n(5,6) is at x=5,y=6.\n\nFrom (5,1), I can go up.\n\nFor example, move U to (5,2) on turn 22.\n\nThen from (5,2), direction up.\n\nThen turn 23: from (5,2), moves: U to (5,3), but (5,3) is occupied? After previous moves.\n\nLet's trace the snake positions.\n\nAfter turn 20: ate at (6,1), snake: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)] tail (6,5)\n\nTurn 21: move L to (5,1) no eat: new head (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4) — tail (6,4), (6,5) removed.\n\nPositions: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)] tail (6,4)\n\nTurn 22: move U to (5,2) no eat: new head (5,2), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4) — tail (5,4), (6,4) removed.\n\nNew snake: [(5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)] tail (5,4)\n\nHead at (5,2), direction U (up).\n\nNow, (5,3) is occupied by body, the sixth segment? Positions: index 0: (5,2) head, 1: (5,1), 2: (6,1), 3: (6,2), 4: (6,3), 5: (5,3), 6: (5,4) tail.\n\nSo (5,3) is occupied, not tail.\n\nFrom (5,2), turn 23: possible moves:\n\nU to (5,3): occupied by body, collision.\n\nD to (5,1): occupied by body, segment 1.\n\nL to (4,2): empty?\n\nR to (6,2): occupied by body, segment 3.\n\nSo only possible move L to (4,2)\n\nMove L to (4,2)\n\nThen new head (4,2), direction left.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI can continue to move left and up.\n\nNow, to get to (5,6), I need to go up to y=6.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) is far.\n\nBut (5,6) is at x=5,y=6, which is above the current area.\n\nAlso, there is obstacle at (4,6), so to reach (5,6), I can from (4,2) or other.\n\nBut let's see if I can plan a path to eat (5,6).\n\nFirst, on turn 19: must move D\n\nTurn 19: D\n\nThen turn 20: move D to (6,1) eat food\n\nTurn 21: move L to (5,1)\n\nNow for turn 22, I can move U to (5,2) or L to (4,1)\n\nIf I move U to (5,2), as above, then turn 23 must move L to (4,2)\n\nThen turn 24: from (4,2), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,3), D to (4,1), L to (3,2), R to (5,2) occupied.\n\n(4,1) might be empty, etc.\n\nBut I need to go up.\n\nFrom (4,2), I can move U to (4,3)\n\nAssume it's empty.\n\nThen turn 25: from (4,3), move U to (4,4), and so on.\n\nBut (5,6) is at y=6, so I need to reach there.\n\nFrom the left, I can go to (5,6) from (5,5) or (4,6) but (4,6) obstacle, so from (5,5) or (6,6) but y=6, x=6.\n\n(5,6) can be accessed from (5,5), (4,6) obstacle, (6,6), or (5,7) wall, so only from (5,5) or (6,6).\n\n(6,6) is possible.\n\nBut in the current snake, the tail is moving.\n\nTo eat (5,6), I need the head to be at (4,6) but obstacle, or (5,5), or (6,6), or (5,7) invalid.\n\nSo adjacent cells: (5,5), (6,6), (4,6) obstacle, so only (5,5) and (6,6).\n\n(5,5) is at x=5,y=5.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) x=6,y=6.\n\nNow, from my current path, I am at (4,2) on turn 24, for example.\n\nIt might take many turns to reach y=6.\n\nBut (5,6) has long life span, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) is at x=1,y=6, which is top left.\n\nI should aim for (5,6) first since it's closer.\n\nBut let's see the initial position after turn 19 move.\n\nPerhaps on turn 20, instead of eating (6,1), I move to (5,2) to have more flexibility.\n\nThen from (5,2), I can go up or down.\n\nBut (6,1) food must be eaten by turn 22.\n\nIf on turn 20 I move to (5,2), turn 21 move to (5,1), turn 22 move to (6,1) eat, but as we saw, after eating on turn 22, I die on turn 23 because trapped.\n\nSo that is not possible; I must avoid that.\n\nTherefore, the only safe way to eat (6,1) is on turn 20 from (6,2).\n\nOtherwise, I risk not eating it or dying.\n\nSo I should eat it on turn 20.\n\nThen for the other food, I can navigate.\n\nAlso, for (5,6), it is at y=6, and the tail was at (6,5), which is below it.\n\nBut after moves, the tail moves.\n\nIn the state after eating (6,1), snake is at (6,1), etc.\n\nI can try to go up through the left side.\n\nFor example, from (5,1), on turn 22, instead of going to (5,2), I can go left to (4,1), then up.\n\nTurn 21: after eating on turn 20, move L to (5,1) on turn 21.\n\nTurn 22: from (5,1), move L to (4,1)  -- let's say.\n\nThen new head (4,1), direction left.\n\nThen turn 23: from (4,1), move U to (4,2) or L to (3,1) or D to (4,0) invalid, or R to (5,1) occupied.\n\nSo U or L.\n\nIf move U to (4,2), then continue up.\n\nTo reach (5,6), I need to go to (5,5) or (6,6).\n\n(6,6) might be free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) is far.\n\nBut let's not plan all turns, since I need to output 5+ turns.\n\nPerhaps for the answer, I can provide the sequence for the next few turns.\n\nSince on turn 19 I must move D, and on turn 20 move D to eat, then turn 21 move L, then from there I have choices.\n\nBut for the answer format, I need to specify actions for several turns.\n\nLet's list actions from turn 19 onwards.\n\nTurn 19: D (down) to (6,2)\n\nTurn 20: D (down) to (6,1) eat food\n\nTurn 21: L (left) to (5,1)  -- only choice\n\nNow turn 22: from (5,1), I can move U to (5,2) or L to (4,1)\n\nBoth are possible for survival.\n\nTo reach other food, moving U might be better to go up.\n\nMoving L left might lead to (1,6) eventually.\n\nBut (1,6) has life span until turn 25, so I have time.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) until turn 28.\n\nSo for now, I can move U to (5,2) on turn 22.\n\nThen as before, on turn 23, from (5,2) I must move L to (4,2)\n\nThen turn 24: from (4,2), I can move U to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut let's see the grid for obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), so when going up, at y=6, (4,6) blocked.\n\nBut for now, I think for the answer, I can provide up to turn 24 or so.\n\nSince the food at (6,1) is critical, I think the sequence is:\n\nTurn 19: D\n\nTurn 20: D  (eat food)\n\nTurn 21: L\n\nThen for turn 22, let's say move U to (5,2)\n\nTurn 23: move L to (4,2)  (only choice)\n\nTurn 24: from (4,2), move U to (4,3)  (assume empty)\n\nBut I need to confirm if it's safe.\n\nSince the AI can think, but for output, I need to specify.\n\nPerhaps for simplicity, since the immediate moves are constrained, I can output that.\n\nBut the state has food at (1,6) and (5,6), so I should consider going towards them.\n\nFrom (4,2), I can go to (4,3), then (4,4), (4,5), but at (4,5), to go to (4,6) is obstacle, so I cannot go up to y=6 at x=4.\n\nSo I need to go to x=5 or x=6 for y=6.\n\nFor example, from (4,5), I can move R to (5,5), then to (5,6) if possible.\n\n(5,6) has food.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) is free.\n\nBut let's not detail.\n\nFor the answer, I can provide:\n\nTurn 19: D\n\nTurn 20: D\n\nTurn 21: L\n\nThen for turn 22, I choose U to start going up.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nThen turn 23: L (as before)\n\nBut on turn 23 from (5,2), after move U on turn 22, positions: let's not.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSince the problem asks to think 5+ turns ahead, but for output, I need to list actions for specific turns.\n\nCurrent turn t1=19, so output actions for turn 19,20,21,22,23, etc.\n\nAt least 5 turns.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 19: D\n\nTurn 20: D\n\nTurn 21: L\n\nTurn 22: U (to (5,2))\n\nThen from (5,2), on turn 23, as before, only L to (4,2)\n\nTurn 23: L\n\nThen turn 24: from (4,2), I can move U to (4,3) or D to (4,1) or L to (3,2), etc.\n\nI choose U to go up.\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nThen turn 25: from (4,3), move U to (4,4), etc.\n\nBut I can stop at turn 23 or 24.\n\nSince turn 19 to 23 is 5 turns.\n\nt1=19, then t1 to t1+4 for 5 turns? Turn 19,20,21,22,23 is 5 actions.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 22, if I move U to (5,2), and turn 23 move L to (4,2), both safe.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut for the answer, I think it's acceptable.\n\nTo get to (5,6), from current, after turn 21 at (5,1), if I move L to (4,1) on turn 22, then I am closer to left, but (5,6) is right, so better to go up from (5,1) or (5,2).\n\nSo I think moving U on turn 22 is reasonable.\n\nTherefore, the actions:\n\nTurn 19: D\n\nTurn 20: D\n\nTurn 21: L\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: L  (from (5,2) to (4,2))\n\nAnd that should be fine for now.\n\nIn turn 23, moving L to (4,2) is safe.\n\nThen the snake can survive and go for other food later.\n\nSo for the boxed answer.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 19):**\n- **Grid**: 8x8 grid with walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Accessible area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6. Internal obstacle at (4,6).\n- **Snake**: Head at (6,3), direction right. Positions: [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)] (6 segments). Tail at (5,5).\n- **Food**:\n  - (6,1): Value +1, life span 4 (disappears after turn 22).\n  - (1,6): Value +1, life span 7 (disappears after turn 25).\n  - (5,6): Value +1, life span 10 (disappears after turn 28).\n- **Immediate Constraints**: \n  - Current head direction is right (R), so left (L) is reverse and not allowed.\n  - Possible moves from (6,3): \n    - Up (U) to (6,4): Occupied by body (segment at (6,4)), collision risk. Invalid.\n    - Down (D) to (6,2): Empty and safe.\n    - Right (R) to (7,3): Wall, invalid.\n    - Left (L): Reverse, invalid.\n  - Only safe move on turn 19 is **D (down)** to (6,2).\n\n**Key Considerations for 5+ Turn Plan:**\n- **Prioritize Survival and Food Access**: \n  - Food at (6,1) has short life span (only available until turn 22) and must be eaten soon. Eating it on turn 20 is optimal to avoid missing it and to allow movement flexibility.\n  - After eating (6,1), the snake grows to 7 segments. Movement is constrained to the bottom-left initially, but paths to other food (especially (5,6) with long life span) must be planned.\n  - Food at (1,6) is less urgent; it can be targeted later if possible.\n- **Avoid Traps**: \n  - Eating (6,1) on turn 22 or later risks trapping the snake (e.g., if done from (5,1), the snake dies on turn 23 due to body collisions). Thus, eating it on turn 20 is safer.\n  - After eating (6,1), the only exit is left to (5,1) on turn 21. From there, moving up (U) on turn 22 avoids dead ends and starts navigation toward the top food.\n- **Path to (5,6)**: \n  - (5,6) is accessible from (5,5), (6,6), or (4,6) but (4,6) is an obstacle. Moving up via the left (e.g., to (4,2), (4,3), etc.) allows a path to (5,5) or (6,6) for accessing (5,6) in later turns.\n  - Life span of (5,6) is long (until turn 28), so reaching it by turn 24-28 is feasible.\n- **Movement Sequence**: \n  - Turns 19-21 are forced due to constraints and food urgency.\n  - On turn 22, moving up (U) from (5,1) to (5,2) is chosen to ascend toward y=6 and avoid the left edge, enabling future access to (5,6).\n  - On turn 23, from (5,2), only left (L) to (4,2) is safe (up/down/right lead to collisions or walls). This continues the path upward.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: \n  - After turn 23, the snake can move up (e.g., to (4,3), (4,4)) and then right toward (5,6). The open area on the left provides maneuvering room.\n  - (1,6) can be considered if the snake navigates left after (5,6), but it's lower priority due to distance and time.\n\n**Planned Actions (Turns 19-23):**\n- **Turn 19 (t=19)**: Move D (down) to (6,2) – only safe move.\n- **Turn 20 (t=20)**: Move D (down) to (6,1) – eat food (+1 score, snake grows to 7 segments).\n- **Turn 21 (t=21)**: Move L (left) to (5,1) – only safe move from (6,1).\n- **Turn 22 (t=22)**: Move U (up) to (5,2) – start ascending toward top food; avoids left-edge trap.\n- **Turn 23 (t=23)**: Move L (left) to (4,2) – continue path upward; only safe move from (5,2).\n\n**Projected State After Turn 23:**\n- **Snake Positions**: [(4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)] (7 segments; tail at (5,3)).\n- **Head Direction**: Left (after turn 23 move).\n- **Food Status**: \n  - (6,1): Eaten on turn 20.\n  - (1,6): Life span 3 left (available until turn 25).\n  - (5,6): Life span 7 left (available until turn 28).\n- **Next Moves (Beyond Plan)**: From (4,2), move up (e.g., to (4,3) on turn 24) to reach y=6 area for (5,6). Path is safe with no immediate collisions.\n\nThis plan maximizes score by securing the time-sensitive food at (6,1) and sets up a path to (5,6) while ensuring survival for 5+ turns. Actions prioritize long-term access to food over short-term gains.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 19: D \\\\\nTurn 20: D \\\\\nTurn 21: L \\\\\nTurn 22: U \\\\\nTurn 23: L\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. The current turn is 20.\n\nWalls: The borders are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), and moving to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 would be a wall collision. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: The snake is made up of segments: head at (6,2), then (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), and tail at (6,5). So the snake has 6 segments.\n\nHead direction is down (D), meaning it was moving downward last turn.\n\nFood:\n\n- (6,1) with life span 3 and value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (1,6) with life span 6 and value 1 (positive)\n\n- (5,6) with life span 9 and value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive; no negative food mentioned.\n\nI need to plan actions for the next 5+ turns to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival. I must think ahead to avoid collisions and consider food life spans.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid. It's 8x8, since x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all border cells, so (0,y) for y=0 to7, (7,y) for y=0 to7, (x,0) for x=0 to7, (x,7) for x=0 to7. Also internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake: positions: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nHead at (6,2), direction down. Since direction is down, the head moved from (6,2) to... wait no, positions are given as of now, turn 20. Head direction is D, meaning it was moving down to get to (6,2)? Let's see.\n\nSnake positions: [(6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)]\n\nThe head is at (6,2), and since direction is D, it must have come from above. Previous head position was (6,1)? But (6,1) has food, so it wasn't there. Let's think about movement.\n\nAt turn 19, head was at some position, moved down to (6,2) at turn 20.\n\nBut (6,1) has food, and life span 3, so it might have been there or not. We don't have history, only current state.\n\nCurrent head is at (6,2), direction down, so it was moving down to reach (6,2). That means at previous turn, head was at (6,1), and it moved down to (6,2). But (6,1) has food, so when the head moved to (6,1), it should have eaten the food if it was there at that time.\n\nFood life span: for (6,1), life span 3 at turn 20. That means it will disappear after 3 turns, including turn 20. So on turn 20, life span 3; turn 21, it becomes 2; turn 22, it becomes 1; turn 23, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut when the head moves to a food cell, it eats it.\n\nIn this case, head is at (6,2) now, and it came from (6,1) if direction is down. But (6,1) has food, so if it was on (6,1) at turn 19 or something, it might have eaten it, but we don't know.\n\nSince the snake is at (6,2) now and direction is down, it means on the previous move, it moved from (6,1) to (6,2), so at that time, if (6,1) had food, it should have been eaten. But food is still listed, so perhaps the food was not there when the head was on (6,1), or it was spawned later.\n\nThe food positions are given for the current state, turn 20.\n\nFor (6,1), life span 3 at turn 20, so it was spawned on turn 18 or something? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n\nIf life span is L at turn t, it means it will disappear after L turns, so it exists on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L.\n\nStandard: if life span is N at turn t, it exists for N more turns, so after N turns it disappears. Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n\nSo at turn t, life span N, it will be present on turn t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and gone on turn t+N.\n\nFor (6,1) at turn 20, life span 3: present on turn 20, 21, 22; gone on 23.\n\n(1,6) life span 6: present turn 20 to 25, gone 26.\n\n(5,6) life span 9: present turn 20 to 28, gone 29.\n\nNow, snake head is at (6,2), direction down. Since it moved down to get here, previous head position was (6,1) at turn 19. At turn 19, if (6,1) had food, it would have been eaten, but since the food is still listed at turn 20 with life span 3, it means that at turn 19, (6,1) did not have food, or the food was spawned on turn 20. We don't know the spawn time, only current state.\n\nSo for now, at turn 20, (6,1) has food, and snake head is at (6,2), so the food is under the snake's body? (6,1) is not part of the snake body; let's list all snake positions.\n\nSnake: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)\n\n(6,1) is not occupied by snake; it's a free cell with food.\n\n(6,1) has food, and it's adjacent to head at (6,2).\n\nHead is at (6,2), food at (6,1), which is directly above, since y increases up or down? In coordinates, it says U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? Let's confirm.\n\nMovement: U (x,y+1) – so y+1 is up, meaning higher y is north or up.\n\nD (x,y-1) – y-1 is down, lower y.\n\nL (x-1,y) – left, lower x.\n\nR (x+1,y) – right, higher x.\n\nWalls: y=0 is bottom row, y=7 is top row. x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nSo head at (6,2), which is x=6, y=2.\n\nFood at (6,1): x=6, y=1, which is below (6,2) since y=1 < y=2, so down.\n\n(6,1) is at (x=6, y=1), which is directly below (6,2) because y decreases down.\n\n(6,2) to (6,1) is moving down, since D is (x,y-1).\n\nHead direction is down, meaning it just moved down to (6,2) from (6,1)? But (6,1) has food, so if it was on (6,1) and moved to (6,2), it should have eaten the food at (6,1) when it was there, but the food is still listed, so contradiction.\n\nPerhaps the food was not there when the snake was on (6,1).\n\nSince the snake just moved to (6,2) at turn 20, and food is at (6,1) with life span 3 at turn 20, it means that the food was spawned at (6,1) on this turn or earlier, but when the snake head was on (6,1) at turn 19, the food might not have been there, or it was but not eaten because the head moved away.\n\nRule: food can be under the body and can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nBut in this case, (6,1) was the previous head position, not a body segment.\n\nAt turn 19, head was at (6,1), and it moved down to (6,2) at turn 20.\n\nIf at turn 19, (6,1) had food, moving to (6,2) would not eat it because the head is leaving, not moving onto it. To eat food, head must move onto the cell with food.\n\nSo if at turn 19, (6,1) had food, and head was on it, it should have been eaten at that time. But since food is still listed at turn 20, it means that at turn 19, (6,1) did not have food, and the food was spawned at turn 20 or was there but not under head when head was there.\n\nSince we don't have history, we can assume that for current state, the food at (6,1) is present and not eaten yet.\n\nSo head is at (6,2), food at (6,1) which is directly below, but since head is at y=2, (6,1) is at y=1, which is down, so to move to (6,1) would be down again.\n\nBut head direction is down, so moving down again is allowed, not reverse because reverse would be up, which is opposite.\n\nCurrent head direction is D (down), so possible moves: not up (U), because that would be reverse. Can move down, left, or right.\n\nFrom (6,2), possible moves:\n\n- Down (D): to (6,1)\n\n- Left (L): to (5,2)\n\n- Right (R): to (7,2) but x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n\nx=7 is wall, so cannot move right to (7,2).\n\nDown to (6,1): is it safe? (6,1) has food, so if move there, eat food, snake grows.\n\nLeft to (5,2): what is there? No food listed, so empty, I assume.\n\nAlso, cannot move up because reverse from down.\n\nU would be to (6,3), but (6,3) is a body segment, so moving there would cause collision.\n\nLet's list all occupied cells.\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- Head: (6,2)\n\n- Body: (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nAlso, walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal (4,6)\n\nFood at (6,1), (1,6), (5,6)\n\nNow, for head at (6,2), direction down.\n\nPossible actions:\n\n- U (up): to (6,3) – but (6,3) is a body segment, so collision, death. Invalid.\n\n- D (down): to (6,1) – this cell has food, and it's not occupied by body, so if move there, eat food, snake grows to 7 segments. Also, y=1, not wall, since walls are y=0, so y=1 is safe.\n\n- L (left): to (5,2) – no food, not wall, not body? Snake positions: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5). So (5,2) is not listed, so should be empty. Also not wall.\n\n- R (right): to (7,2) – x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n\nSo only possible moves: down to (6,1) or left to (5,2).\n\nNow, if move down to (6,1), eat food, snake grows: new head at (6,1), and tail stays, so body becomes: after move, head moves to (6,1), and the tail (6,5) will move away? When snake moves, head moves to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail is removed unless food eaten.\n\nStandard snake: when head moves to a cell without food, tail moves forward, snake length same. When head moves to food, tail does not move, snake grows by one.\n\nIn this case, if move to (6,1), which has food, so eat it, snake grows: new positions: head at (6,1), then previous head (6,2) becomes body, then (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), and new tail at (6,5) or? Length increases, so tail doesn't move.\n\nPositions before move: head (6,2), body (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), tail (6,5)\n\nAfter moving down to (6,1) and eating food: new head at (6,1), then the segments: (6,2) becomes first body, then (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) remains, so snake: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)] 7 segments.\n\nNow, life span of (6,1) food decreases to 2 on next turn, but since eaten, it's gone.\n\nIf move left to (5,2), no food, so snake moves: head to (5,2), then body: (6,2) becomes first body, then (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), and tail (6,5) is removed? When no food eaten, tail moves away.\n\nAfter move left: head to (5,2), then segments: the old head (6,2) becomes body, so positions: [(5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)] and the last segment (6,5) is removed, so tail is now (6,4)? Let's see: the body segments shift: the segment that was at (6,3) moves to (6,2)? No.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the chain.\n\nSo positions: index 0: head, 1,2,3,4,5 tail.\n\nAfter moving head to new position, new head is the new position, then segment 1 moves to where head was, segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was, and so on, and the tail position is vacated if no growth.\n\nSo if move left to (5,2): new positions: head: (5,2), then body: (6,2) [which was head], then (6,3) [was body1], then (5,3) [body2], then (5,4) [body3], then (6,4) [body4], and (6,5) is no longer part of snake, so snake now: [(5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)] 6 segments.\n\nSimilarly, if move down to (6,1) with food, new head (6,1), then body: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) — all kept, so 7 segments.\n\nNow, back to decision.\n\nAt turn 20, I need to choose action.\n\nBut I have to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nAlso, consider food life spans.\n\nFood at (6,1) has life span 3, so it will disappear on turn 23 if not eaten.\n\nBut if I move down now, I eat it immediately.\n\nIf I don't, it might be eaten later or disappear.\n\nOther foods: (1,6) and (5,6), both with longer life span.\n\n(5,6) is at x=5,y=6, which is near, but there's an obstacle at (4,6), so (4,6) is wall.\n\n(5,6) is food, not wall.\n\nNow, let's plan possible paths.\n\nFirst, option: move down to (6,1) at turn 20.\n\nThen snake grows to 7 segments, positions: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)]\n\nHead at (6,1), direction down (since moved down).\n\nThen from here, possible moves.\n\nHead at (6,1), direction down.\n\nPossible moves: not up (reverse), so can go down, left, right.\n\nDown to (6,0): but y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n\nLeft to (5,1): is it free? Let's see current positions: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5). So (5,1) not occupied, not wall? Walls: y=0 bottom, but y=1 is ok, x=5,y=1.\n\nInternal obstacles only (4,6), so (5,1) should be free.\n\nRight to (7,1): x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move left to (5,1).\n\nThen move left to (5,1) at turn 21.\n\nNo food at (5,1), so snake moves: head to (5,1), then body: (6,1) becomes body, (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), and tail (6,5) removed? After eating at turn 20, snake has 7 segments: positions after turn 20: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)]\n\nAfter moving left to (5,1) at turn 21, no food, so head to (5,1), then segments shift: body0 to (6,1), body1 to (6,2), body2 to (6,3), body3 to (5,3), body4 to (5,4), body5 to (6,4), and tail (6,5) is removed? Index: let's list.\n\nNew head: (5,1)\n\nThen the first body segment is the previous head position (6,1)\n\nThen second body is previous body0, which was (6,2) — since positions: after turn 20: index 0: (6,1) head, 1: (6,2), 2: (6,3), 3: (5,3), 4: (5,4), 5: (6,4), 6: (6,5) tail.\n\nAfter move to (5,1), new head: (5,1)\n\nThen new body segments: position 1: (6,1) [previous head]\n\nPosition 2: (6,2) [previous body1]\n\nPosition 3: (6,3) [previous body2]\n\nPosition 4: (5,3) [previous body3]\n\nPosition 5: (5,4) [previous body4]\n\nPosition 6: (6,4) [previous body5]\n\nAnd (6,5) is no longer part of snake.\n\nSo snake now: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)] 7 segments? Length same because no food eaten, but after growth at turn 20, length 7, after move without food, length should be 7, but tail moved.\n\nPositions: head (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4). So tail at (6,4), 7 segments.\n\n(6,5) was tail, but since no growth, it is removed, and the segment before becomes new tail.\n\nYes.\n\nNow head at (5,1), direction left (since moved left from (6,1) to (5,1)).\n\nThen from (5,1), possible moves.\n\nDirection left, so cannot move right (reverse).\n\nPossible: up, down, left.\n\nUp to (5,2): is it free? Current positions: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)\n\n(5,2) not occupied, not wall.\n\nDown to (5,0): y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nLeft to (4,1): not wall, but internal obstacle? Internal obstacle at (4,6), not (4,1), so (4,1) should be free.\n\nBut (4,1) is not occupied, I think.\n\nx=4,y=1, no wall except borders, internal only (4,6).\n\nSo can move up to (5,2), down invalid, left to (4,1).\n\nBut down invalid, so up or left.\n\nIf move up to (5,2), or left to (4,1).\n\nBut we are at turn 21, and I need to think ahead, but this path seems not good because after eating at (6,1), we are stuck near bottom with few options.\n\nFood at (6,1) is gone.\n\nOther foods: (1,6) and (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is at x=5,y=6, which is top-right area.\n\nBut with snake now at bottom-left, it might be hard to reach.\n\nIn this scenario, after turn 20 down, turn 21 left to (5,1), then at turn 22, from (5,1), say move up to (5,2).\n\nThen head to (5,2), no food, positions shift: new head (5,2), body: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), tail (6,4)? Previous positions: head (5,1), body (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)\n\nAfter move up to (5,2): new head (5,2), body: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), and (6,4) removed? No: segments shift.\n\nNew positions: head (5,2), then body0: (5,1) [prev head], body1: (6,1) [prev body0], body2: (6,2) [prev body1], body3: (6,3) [prev body2], body4: (5,3) [prev body3], body5: (5,4) [prev body4], and body6: (6,4) [prev body5], but since no growth, the last segment (6,4) is removed, so new tail is (5,4)? Let's clarify.\n\nAfter move without food, the snake length remains the same, so one segment is removed from the tail.\n\nSo positions before move: 7 segments: pos0: (5,1) head, pos1: (6,1), pos2: (6,2), pos3: (6,3), pos4: (5,3), pos5: (5,4), pos6: (6,4) tail.\n\nAfter moving head to (5,2), new head: (5,2)\n\nThen new body:\n\n- Segment at pos1: moves to where head was, (5,1)\n\n- Segment at pos2: moves to where pos1 was, (6,1)\n\n- Segment at pos3: moves to where pos2 was, (6,2)\n\n- Segment at pos4: moves to where pos3 was, (6,3)\n\n- Segment at pos5: moves to where pos4 was, (5,3)\n\n- Segment at pos6: moves to where pos5 was, (5,4)\n\nAnd the old pos6 (6,4) is vacated.\n\nSo new positions: head (5,2), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4) — so tail at (5,4), 7 segments.\n\n(6,4) is gone.\n\nThen from here, head at (5,2), direction up (since moved up from (5,1) to (5,2)).\n\nAnd so on. But this seems messy, and we are moving away from other foods.\n\nThe other option at turn 20 is to move left to (5,2).\n\nLet's consider that.\n\nAt turn 20, move left to (5,2).\n\nThen no food, so snake moves: head to (5,2), then body: (6,2) becomes body, then (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), and tail (6,5) removed.\n\nPositions before: head (6,2), body (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nAfter move left to (5,2): new head (5,2)\n\nThen body: (6,2) [prev head], (6,3) [prev body0], (5,3) [prev body1], (5,4) [prev body2], (6,4) [prev body3]\n\nAnd (6,5) removed.\n\nSo snake: [(5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)] 6 segments.\n\nHead at (5,2), direction left (since moved left from (6,2) to (5,2)).\n\nNow, from (5,2), possible moves.\n\nDirection left, so cannot move right.\n\nPossible: up, down, left.\n\nUp to (5,3): but (5,3) is a body segment, collision! (5,3) is in the snake body, so cannot move there.\n\nDown to (5,1): free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\nLeft to (4,2): free? Not wall, not occupied.\n\nAlso, right is invalid.\n\nSo can move down to (5,1) or left to (4,2).\n\nNow, food available: (6,1) at (6,1) with life span 3, so on turn 20,21,22 present.\n\n(1,6) and (5,6) with longer life.\n\nIf I move down to (5,1) at turn 20, but I'm at turn 20 moving to (5,2), so at turn 21.\n\nLet's sequence.\n\nTurn 20: move left to (5,2), as above.\n\nTurn 21: from (5,2), head direction left.\n\nMove down to (5,1) or left to (4,2).\n\nFirst, move down to (5,1).\n\n(5,1) has no food, so move: head to (5,1), no food, so positions shift.\n\nCurrent before move: head (5,2), body (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)\n\nAfter move down to (5,1): new head (5,1)\n\nBody: (5,2) [prev head], (6,2) [prev body0], (6,3) [prev body1], (5,3) [prev body2], (5,4) [prev body3], and (6,4) removed.\n\nSo snake: [(5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)] 6 segments.\n\nHead at (5,1), direction down (moved down).\n\nThen from (5,1), possible moves: not up (reverse), so down, left, right.\n\nDown to (5,0): y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nLeft to (4,1): free.\n\nRight to (6,1): (6,1) has food, and it's free? Not occupied by snake now.\n\nCurrent positions: (5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)\n\n(6,1) is free, has food.\n\nSo can move right to (6,1).\n\nIf move to (6,1), eat food, grow.\n\nHead at (5,1), to (6,1) is right, so direction right.\n\nMove right to (6,1) at turn 22? Let's set turns.\n\nTurn 20: move left to (5,2)\n\nTurn 21: move down to (5,1)\n\nThen at turn 22, from (5,1), move right to (6,1)\n\nThen eat food at (6,1), which has life span, at turn 22, life span was 3 at turn 20, so turn 21: life span 2, turn 22: life span 1, so still present.\n\nEat it, snake grows to 7 segments.\n\nNew positions: head (6,1), then body: (5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), and tail stays? Before move: positions: head (5,1), body (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)\n\nAfter move to (6,1) with food: new head (6,1), then body: (5,1) [prev head], (5,2) [prev body0], (6,2) [prev body1], (6,3) [prev body2], (5,3) [prev body3], (5,4) [prev body4]\n\nAnd since growth, no removal, so new tail is (5,4), 7 segments.\n\nPositions: [(6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)]\n\nThen head at (6,1), direction right.\n\nFrom here, similar to before, can only move left to (5,1) but (5,1) is body, collision, or down to (6,0) wall, or up to (6,2) body, collision! (6,2) is body segment.\n\nPossible moves from (6,1): U to (6,2) - body, collision; D to (6,0) wall; L to (5,1) - body, collision; R to (7,1) wall. All invalid! Snake trapped, death.\n\nOh, big problem.\n\nAfter eating at (6,1) from this position, the snake is stuck because all adjacent cells are wall or body.\n\nSpecifically: up (6,2) is body, down (6,0) wall, left (5,1) body, right (7,1) wall.\n\nSo instant death on next turn.\n\nTherefore, this path is bad.\n\nIf at turn 21, from (5,2), instead of moving down to (5,1), I move left to (4,2).\n\nTurn 20: move left to (5,2)\n\nTurn 21: move left to (4,2)\n\nNo food at (4,2), so move: head to (4,2), positions shift.\n\nBefore: head (5,2), body (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)\n\nAfter move to (4,2): new head (4,2), body: (5,2) [prev head], (6,2) [prev body0], (6,3) [prev body1], (5,3) [prev body2], (5,4) [prev body3], and (6,4) removed.\n\nSnake: [(4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)] 6 segments.\n\nHead at (4,2), direction left.\n\nThen from (4,2), possible moves: not right (reverse), so up, down, left.\n\nUp to (4,3): free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\nDown to (4,1): free.\n\nLeft to (3,2): free, but x=3,y=2, not wall.\n\nAlso, walls only borders and (4,6), so all good.\n\nNow, food at (6,1) is still there, but life span decreasing.\n\nTo reach other foods, need to go towards (1,6) or (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is at (5,6), which is near, but obstacle at (4,6), so (4,6) is wall, so to reach (5,6), need to go around.\n\nAlso, snake body is around (4,2) to (5,4), etc.\n\nPerhaps better to avoid eating (6,1) immediately and go for other foods.\n\nBut (6,1) has short life, so if not eaten soon, it disappears.\n\nAt turn 20, if I don't eat (6,1), and move left to (5,2), then I can later eat it or not.\n\nBut from above, if I try to eat it later, I might get stuck.\n\nAnother option: at turn 20, move left to (5,2), then at turn 21, I can move up or down or left, but not right.\n\nFrom (5,2), I can move up to (5,3)? But (5,3) is body, collision, so only down or left.\n\nDown to (5,1) or left to (4,2).\n\nIf I move down to (5,1), then as before, at turn 22, if I move right to (6,1), I eat but get stuck.\n\nIf from (5,1) I don't move to (6,1), I can move left to (4,1) or down invalid.\n\nMove left to (4,1) at turn 22.\n\nThen from (4,1), etc., but (6,1) food might expire soon.\n\nBut let's think about the other food.\n\nFood at (5,6) at (5,6), which is above.\n\nCurrent snake head at (6,2), if I can go up.\n\nBut from (6,2), I can only move down or left, not up because up is body.\n\nAt turn 20, only down or left possible.\n\nIf I move left to (5,2), then from there, I can't move up because (5,3) is body.\n\nBut after moving left to (5,2), the body is at (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), etc.\n\nAt turn 21, from (5,2), if I move left to (4,2), then head at (4,2), then I can move up to (4,3), for example.\n\n(4,3) is free.\n\nThen from (4,3), I can move up to (4,4), and so on, towards (5,6) or (1,6).\n\n(5,6) is at y=6, x=5.\n\nAlso, there is food at (1,6).\n\nBut (5,6) is closer.\n\nLife span of (6,1) is short, only until turn 22 present, gone on 23.\n\nAt turn 20, if I don't eat it, by turn 21 it has life span 2, turn 22 life span 1, gone turn 23.\n\nSo if I don't eat it by turn 22, it disappears.\n\nNow, at turn 20, if I move left to (5,2), then at turn 21, I can move to (4,2) or (5,1).\n\nIf I move to (4,2), then at turn 22, I can move to (4,3) or (4,1) or (3,2), all far from (6,1), so I can't eat (6,1) in time, so it will disappear unused.\n\nIf I move to (5,1) at turn 21, then at turn 22, I can move to (6,1) to eat, but as before, I get stuck and die.\n\nSo eating (6,1) seems risky or leads to death.\n\nTherefore, perhaps it's better not to eat it at all and focus on other foods.\n\nAt turn 20, move left to (5,2), then at turn 21, move left to (4,2), then from there, I can navigate to other areas.\n\nFor example, from (4,2), move up to (4,3) at turn 22.\n\nThen head at (4,3), direction up.\n\nThen move up to (4,4) at turn 23, and so on.\n\nFood at (5,6) is at (5,6), which is north-east.\n\nBut there is an obstacle at (4,6), so (4,6) is wall, so to reach (5,6), I need to go to (5,5) or something.\n\nAvailable cells.\n\nAlso, the snake body is behind.\n\nLet's list the grid for clarity.\n\nGrid 8x8, rows y=0 to 7, columns x=0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n\nInternal wall at (4,6).\n\nFood:\n- (6,1) value 1, life span 3 at t=20, so present t=20,21,22\n- (1,6) value 1, life span 6 at t=20, present t=20 to 25\n- (5,6) value 1, life span 9 at t=20, present t=20 to 28\n\nSnake: positions (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nHead at (6,2), direction D.\n\nPossible actions at t=20: D to (6,1) or L to (5,2)\n\nIf L to (5,2), then at t=21, from (5,2), direction L, can move D to (5,1) or L to (4,2) (since U to (5,3) body, R invalid)\n\nIf move L to (4,2) at t=21, then head at (4,2), direction L.\n\nAt t=22, from (4,2), can move U to (4,3), D to (4,1), L to (3,2)\n\nSay move U to (4,3) to go towards upper area.\n\nHead at (4,3), direction U.\n\nAt t=23, from (4,3), can move U to (4,4), D to (4,2) but (4,2) is body? After move to (4,3), positions: let's track.\n\nt=20: move L to (5,2), snake: [(5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)]  (tail (6,4), since (6,5) removed)\n\nt=21: move L to (4,2), no food, so new head (4,2), body: (5,2) [prev head], (6,2) [prev body0], (6,3) [prev body1], (5,3) [prev body2], (5,4) [prev body3], and (6,4) removed, so snake: [(4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)] 6 segments.\n\nt=22: move U to (4,3), no food, new head (4,3), body: (4,2) [prev head], (5,2) [prev body0], (6,2) [prev body1], (6,3) [prev body2], (5,3) [prev body3], and (5,4) removed, so snake: [(4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)] 6 segments.\n\nHead at (4,3), direction U.\n\nt=23: from (4,3), can move U to (4,4), D to (4,2) but (4,2) is body, collision? (4,2) is in positions: second segment, so yes, body, cannot move there.\n\nL to (3,3), R to (5,3) but (5,3) is body, collision.\n\nR to (5,3) is invalid.\n\nL to (3,3) free.\n\nD to (4,2) body, invalid.\n\nU to (4,4) free.\n\nSo can move U to (4,4) or L to (3,3).\n\nSay move U to (4,4) to go up.\n\nNew head (4,4), body: (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) and (5,3) is tail? Positions: new head (4,4), then body: (4,3) [prev head], (4,2) [prev body0], (5,2) [prev body1], (6,2) [prev body2], (6,3) [prev body3], and (5,3) removed, so snake: [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3)] 6 segments.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nNow, food at (5,6) can be reached by going to (5,5) or (6,6) but (6,6) is wall? y=7 is top wall, so y=6 is below top.\n\n(5,6) is at x=5,y=6.\n\nFrom current position, after several moves, I can go to (4,4), then to (4,5), but (4,5) is free, then to (4,6) but (4,6) is wall, obstacle, so cannot.\n\nTo reach (5,6), since (4,6) is wall, I need to go from the right or below.\n\nFor example, from (5,5) to (5,6), or (6,6) to (5,6), but (6,6): x=6,y=6, not wall, since borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (6,6) is corner but not wall, walls are the cells, so (6,6) is not wall, but y=7 is wall above.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) is free, except for the internal wall at (4,6).\n\nSo to reach (5,6), I can go to (5,5) then up to (5,6), or to (6,6) then left to (5,6), etc.\n\nBut from the snake position after t=23, it's at (4,4), etc., so I can move right to (5,4) or something.\n\nBut let's not get too deep.\n\nThe point is, by not eating (6,1), I can survive and go for other foods.\n\nBut (6,1) is easy to eat now, but it causes problem.\n\nAnother thing: the \"Tail Reward Danger\" rule: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, at turn 20, tail is at (6,5), head at (6,2), not adjacent; adjacent would be if head next to tail.\n\nHere, head (6,2), tail (6,5), not adjacent.\n\nIf I move down to (6,1), new head (6,1), tail at (6,5), not adjacent.\n\nThen when I move, as before, I get stuck.\n\nSo no issue with tail reward here.\n\nPerhaps for the food at (6,1), since it's below, and I can eat it, but then I have to move left, but in the first option, after eating, I could only move left to (5,1), then from there, I could only move up or down or left, but down wall, so up or left, but up to (5,2) might be free or not.\n\nIn the first scenario: after t=20 move D to (6,1), snake: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)]\n\nHead at (6,1), direction D.\n\nThen at t=21, only possible move L to (5,1), as before.\n\nNew positions: head (5,1), body: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4) and (6,5) removed? After growth at t=20, 7 segments.\n\nMove to (5,1) no food, so new head (5,1), body: (6,1) [prev head], (6,2) [prev body1], (6,3) [prev body2], (5,3) [prev body3], (5,4) [prev body4], (6,4) [prev body5], and (6,5) removed, so tail at (6,4), positions: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)]\n\nHead at (5,1), direction L (since moved left).\n\nThen at t=22, from (5,1), can move U to (5,2), D to (5,0) invalid, L to (4,1), R to (6,1) but (6,1) is body, collision.\n\nU to (5,2): is (5,2) free? Current positions: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)\n\n(5,2) is not in list, so free.\n\nL to (4,1) free.\n\nR to (6,1) body, invalid.\n\nD invalid.\n\nSo can move U to (5,2) or L to (4,1).\n\nSay move U to (5,2) at t=22.\n\nNo food, so new head (5,2), body: (5,1) [prev head], (6,1) [prev body0], (6,2) [prev body1], (6,3) [prev body2], (5,3) [prev body3], (5,4) [prev body4], and (6,4) removed, so snake: [(5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)] 7 segments? Length 7, but after removal, positions: head (5,2), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4) — so tail at (5,4), 7 segments.\n\nHead at (5,2), direction U (moved up).\n\nThen from (5,2), at t=23, can move U to (5,3), but (5,3) is body, collision; D to (5,1) body, collision; L to (4,2) free; R to (6,2) body, collision.\n\nOnly possible move L to (4,2).\n\nThen move L to (4,2), and so on.\n\nSo it's possible to survive, but the snake is longer and in a crowded area.\n\nWhereas if I don't eat at t=20, the snake is shorter and I can maneuver better.\n\nBut eating food gives score, so I need to eat when possible without risk.\n\nIn this case, eating (6,1) at t=20 might be ok, but I have to be careful not to get stuck.\n\nBut from above, after eating, I can move to (5,1), then to (5,2), then to (4,2), etc., so it's possible.\n\nBut let's see the other food.\n\nFood at (5,6) is valuable with long life, so I should go for it.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6).\n\nBut (5,6) is closer.\n\nFrom current position, at t=20, if I move left to (5,2), then I can start moving up.\n\nBut from (5,2), I can't move up because (5,3) is body.\n\nAfter moving left to (5,2), the body is at (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), etc.\n\nAt t=21, if I move left to (4,2), then from (4,2), I can move up to (4,3), then to (4,4), etc.\n\nTo reach (5,6), I need to go to (5,5) or (6,5), but (6,5) was tail, but it might be free later.\n\nFor example, from (4,4), I can move right to (5,4), but (5,4) might be occupied or not.\n\nLet's plan a path to (5,6).\n\nStart from t=20: move L to (5,2)\n\nt=21: move L to (4,2)  (assume no food)\n\nt=22: move U to (4,3)\n\nt=23: move U to (4,4)\n\nt=24: move U to (4,5)  (y=5)\n\nNow (4,5) is free, not wall.\n\nHead at (4,5), direction U.\n\nThen at t=25, from (4,5), can move U to (4,6) but (4,6) is wall, invalid; D to (4,4) body? Let's see positions.\n\nt=24: after move to (4,5), positions: from t=23, assume snake at [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3)] or something, let's track.\n\nBetter to simulate.\n\nt=20: move L to (5,2), snake: [(5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)]  (tail (6,4))\n\nt=21: move L to (4,2), no food, new head (4,2), body: (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), and (6,4) removed, so snake: [(4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)] 6 segments\n\nt=22: move U to (4,3), no food, new head (4,3), body: (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), and (5,4) removed, so snake: [(4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)] 6 segments\n\nt=23: move U to (4,4), no food, new head (4,4), body: (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), and (5,3) removed, so snake: [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3)] 6 segments\n\nt=24: move U to (4,5), no food, new head (4,5), body: (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), and (6,3) removed, so snake: [(4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2)] 6 segments\n\nHead at (4,5), direction U.\n\nt=25: from (4,5), can move U to (4,6) but (4,6) wall, invalid; D to (4,4) body, collision; L to (3,5) free; R to (5,5) free.\n\nSo can move L to (3,5) or R to (5,5).\n\nTo reach (5,6), move R to (5,5).\n\nMove R to (5,5) at t=25.\n\nNo food at (5,5)? Food is at (5,6), so not here.\n\nNew head (5,5), body: (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), and (6,2) removed, so snake: [(5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2)] 6 segments\n\nHead at (5,5), direction R (moved right).\n\nt=26: from (5,5), can move U to (5,6), which has food! (5,6) food present, life span 9 at t=20, t=26 is within, life span decreases, at t=20:9, t=21:8, ..., t=26:3, so present.\n\nMove U to (5,6), eat food, grow.\n\nNew head (5,6), then body: (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), and no removal, so 7 segments.\n\nHead at (5,6), direction U.\n\nThen from (5,6), possible moves: U to (5,7) but y=7 wall, invalid; D to (5,5) body, collision; L to (4,6) wall, invalid; R to (6,6) free.\n\nSo only possible move R to (6,6).\n\nMove to (6,6) at t=27, no food, so new head (6,6), body: (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), and (5,2) removed, so snake: [(6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)] 7 segments.\n\nHead at (6,6), direction R.\n\nThen can move D to (6,5), or U invalid, L to (5,6) body, R to (7,6) wall invalid.\n\nSo move D to (6,5) at t=28, etc.\n\nSurvived and ate one food.\n\nSimilarly, I can go for (1,6) later.\n\nBut (6,1) food was not eaten and disappeared.\n\nNow, back to turn 20, if I move down to (6,1) at t=20, I eat immediately, score +1, then I need to navigate out.\n\nFrom earlier, after eating at t=20, move L to (5,1) at t=21, then U to (5,2) at t=22, then L to (4,2) at t=23, etc., similar to above, and I can still go to (4,5) and eat (5,6) later.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=20: move D to (6,1), eat, snake: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)] 7 seg\n\nt=21: move L to (5,1), no food, new head (5,1), body: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), and (6,5) removed, so snake: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)] 7 seg\n\nt=22: move U to (5,2), no food, new head (5,2), body: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), and (6,4) removed, so snake: [(5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)] 7 seg\n\nt=23: move L to (4,2), no food, new head (4,2), body: (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), and (5,4) removed, so snake: [(4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)] 7 seg\n\nt=24: move U to (4,3), no food, new head (4,3), body: (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), and (5,3) removed, so snake: [(4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)] 7 seg\n\nt=25: move U to (4,4), no food, new head (4,4), body: (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), and (6,3) removed, so snake: [(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)] 7 seg\n\nAnd so on, I can reach (4,5) and (5,5) as before to eat (5,6).\n\nSo in both cases, I can survive and eat (5,6) later.\n\nBut by eating (6,1) at t=20, I get an extra point now, and the snake is longer, which might be riskier but in this path, it seems ok.\n\nThe difference is that with longer snake, it might be harder to maneuver in tight spaces, but here the grid has space.\n\nAlso, food at (1,6) is far, with life span 6 at t=20, so present until t=25, gone t=26.\n\nIn the path above, at t=25, I am at (4,4) or something, far from (1,6), so I might not reach it in time.\n\nFor example, from (4,4) to (1,6) is several moves, and by t=25, it disappears if not eaten.\n\nBut in the path, at t=25, if I start from t=20, with 5 turns, I reach t=25 at (4,4), which is not near (1,6), and (1,6) gone at t=26, so I can't eat it.\n\nSimilarly, if I don't eat (6,1), I can reach (5,6) by t=25 or 26 as above.\n\nBut (1,6) life span to t=25, so at t=25 it is present if life span 1? At t=20 life span 6, present t=20 to 25, gone t=26.\n\nSo to eat at t=25, I need to be at (1,6) on turn 25.\n\nFrom the snake position, it's at (4,4) at t=24 in one path, which is too far.\n\nPerhaps a different path to reach (1,6).\n\nBut (1,6) is at x=1,y=6, top-left.\n\nCurrent head at (6,2), bottom-right.\n\nTo go to (1,6), I need to move left and up.\n\nBut with the body, it might take many turns.\n\nFor example, minimum moves: from (6,2) to (1,6), delta x=5 left, delta y=4 up, so at least 9 moves, but with body, it takes time to traverse.\n\nIn 5 turns, from t=20 to t=24, I might not reach.\n\nFor instance, if I go directly: at t=20 move L to (5,2), t=21 move L to (4,2), t=22 move U to (4,3), t=23 move U to (4,4), t=24 move U to (4,5), still at x=4,y=5, far from (1,6).\n\nThen t=25 move L to (3,5), not there.\n\nSo impossible to reach (1,6) by t=25 to eat it.\n\nSimilarly for other paths.\n\nTherefore, (1,6) might not be reachable in time, so I should not worry about it.\n\nFocus on (6,1) and (5,6).\n\n(6,1) can be eaten now or soon, but with risk if not careful.\n\n(5,6) can be eaten later.\n\nGiven that, at turn 20, moving down to (6,1) gives immediate score, and I can still navigate to eat (5,6) later.\n\nMoving left to (5,2) delays eating, and (6,1) might not be eaten, so I lose that point.\n\nBut by not eating, I have shorter snake, easier to move.\n\nHowever, since I can eat (6,1) safely as per the path, it seems better to eat it.\n\nMoreover, in the move left option, if I don't eat (6,1), it disappears unused.\n\nSo better to eat it.\n\nNow, about the direction: after eating at (6,1), head direction down, then I move left to (5,1), which is allowed.\n\nThen from there, I can go up to (5,2), etc.\n\nNo immediate death.\n\nTherefore, I think at turn 20, move down to eat (6,1).\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the question is to think ahead and output actions for several turns.\n\nThe answer format is to list actions from turn t1 onwards for some turns.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"answer format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nI need to specify actions for turn 20, 21, 22, etc., but I don't have to do all, just a sequence.\n\nBut to be safe, I should plan a sequence that survives and eats food.\n\nSince the state might change, but here no new food spawn, I think we assume only current food.\n\nSo let's plan a sequence.\n\nAt turn 20: move down to (6,1), eat food.\n\nThen turn 21: from (6,1), only possible move left to (5,1)\n\nTurn 22: from (5,1), move up to (5,2) (since down invalid, right to (6,1) body, so up or left; up to (5,2) free)\n\nTurn 23: from (5,2), move left to (4,2) (since up to (5,3) body, down to (5,1) body, right to (6,2) body, only left possible)\n\nThen from (4,2), I can go up, etc., towards (5,6).\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 24: move up to (4,3)\n\nTurn 25: move up to (4,4)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nTo eat (5,6), I need to reach it.\n\nBut in the sequence, I can specify up to turn 24 or 25.\n\nSince the food at (5,6) has long life, I can get there later.\n\nSimilarly, I might not need to specify all turns, but for the answer, I should provide a few actions.\n\nThe format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so for t=20,21,22,23,24.\n\nLet's define.\n\nAlso, for turn 20, action is down.\n\nThen for turn 21, action is left (to (5,1))\n\nFor turn 22, action is up (to (5,2))\n\nFor turn 23, action is left (to (4,2))\n\nThen from (4,2), at turn 24, I can move up to (4,3), or down to (4,1), etc. Say move up to continue.\n\nBut let's see if (4,3) is safe.\n\nAfter turn 23: head at (4,2), direction left.\n\nPositions: after turn 23 move to (4,2), from above.\n\nAfter turn 22: head at (5,2), positions: let's list after each turn.\n\nt=20: move D to (6,1), snake: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)]\n\nt=21: move L to (5,1), no food, new head (5,1), body: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), and (6,5) removed? Segments: new head (5,1), then body: (6,1) [prev head], (6,2) [prev body1], (6,3) [prev body2], (5,3) [prev body3], (5,4) [prev body4], (6,4) [prev body5], and since no food, last segment removed, so body up to (6,4), but (6,4) is kept? After move, the segments shift, and the last one is removed.\n\nPositions before move: 7 segments: 0:(6,1) head? After t=20: head at (6,1), body: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) tail.\n\nAfter move to (5,1) no food: new head (5,1), then new body0: (6,1) [prev head], new body1: (6,2) [prev body0], new body2: (6,3) [prev body1], new body3: (5,3) [prev body2], new body4: (5,4) [prev body3], new body5: (6,4) [prev body4], and the old body5 (6,5) is removed. So positions: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)] with tail at (6,4)? Body5 is (6,4), but (6,4) was prev body4, now it is the last body segment, tail.\n\nt=22: move U to (5,2), no food, new head (5,2), body: (5,1) [prev head], (6,1) [prev body0], (6,2) [prev body1], (6,3) [prev body2], (5,3) [prev body3], (5,4) [prev body4], and (6,4) removed, so snake: [(5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)] 7 segments.\n\nt=23: move L to (4,2), no food, new head (4,2), body: (5,2) [prev head], (5,1) [prev body0], (6,1) [prev body1], (6,2) [prev body2], (6,3) [prev body3], (5,3) [prev body4], and (5,4) removed, so snake: [(4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)] 7 segments.\n\nt=24: from (4,2), head direction left (since moved left from (5,2) to (4,2)).\n\nCan move U to (4,3), D to (4,1), L to (3,2)\n\n(4,3) is free, not occupied.\n\nMove U to (4,3)\n\nThen new head (4,3), body: (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), and (5,3) removed, so snake: [(4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)] 7 segments.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis is fine.\n\nTherefore, for the answer, I can do:\n\nTurn 20: D\n\nTurn 21: L\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: L\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nBut I need to think 5+ turns, so up to turn 24 is 5 turns: t20 to t24, actions for t20,21,22,23,24.\n\nt20, t21, t22, t23, t24: 5 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, at t24 I moved U to (4,3).\n\nTo go towards (5,6), after that, I can move to (4,4), etc.\n\nBut for now, this sequence eats (6,1) and survives.\n\nIf I don't eat (6,1), I miss the point.\n\nSo I think down at t20 is better.\n\nBut in the beginning, I thought about tail reward danger, but not applicable.\n\nAnother thing: food under body, but (6,1) is not under body, it's free.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, action for turn 20: down.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned actions 5 turns ahead (turns 20 to 24). The key considerations are:\n- **Immediate risk and food opportunities**: At turn 20, moving down (D) to (6,1) eats the positive food (+1 score, snake grows to 7 segments) with short life span (disappears after turn 22). This is safe as (6,1) is not adjacent to the tail, avoiding the \"Tail Reward Danger\" rule. Moving left (L) to (5,2) avoids immediate eating but risks losing the (6,1) food and provides no score gain. Eating (6,1) now is optimal for immediate score and does not trap the snake, as subsequent moves can navigate toward the longer-lived food at (5,6).\n- **Long-term survival and food targeting**: After eating (6,1), the snake must navigate carefully to avoid collisions. The path for turns 21-24 moves left and up to open space, setting up for a future approach to (5,6) (life span until turn 28). The food at (1,6) (life span until turn 25) is too distant to reach safely within its life span, so it is ignored.\n- **Collision avoidance**: All moves respect movement constraints (no instant reverse, no wall or body collisions). The sequence ensures the snake does not enter dead ends.\n\n**Planned sequence for turns 20-24:**\n- **Turn 20: D (down)** – Move to (6,1) to eat positive food (+1 score). Snake grows to 7 segments: positions [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)]. Head direction becomes D.\n- **Turn 21: L (left)** – Move to (5,1). No food, so snake moves but length unchanged: positions [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)]. Head direction becomes L.\n- **Turn 22: U (up)** – Move to (5,2). No food, positions shift: [(5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)]. Head direction becomes U.\n- **Turn 23: L (left)** – Move to (4,2). No food, positions shift: [(4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)]. Head direction becomes L.\n- **Turn 24: U (up)** – Move to (4,3). No food, positions shift: [(4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)]. Head direction becomes U.\n\n**Reasoning for 5+ turns ahead:**\n- **Survival focus**: The sequence avoids all collisions and walls. After turn 24, the snake can continue toward (5,6) (e.g., via (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), then (5,6) by turn 26–27) to eat another positive food.\n- **Risk assessment**: Eating (6,1) at turn 20 is low-risk; the subsequent path keeps the snake in open areas. Not eating it wastes a scoring opportunity, as it disappears after turn 22.\n- **Score maximization**: This plan secures +1 score immediately and positions the snake to potentially eat (5,6) for another +1. The longer snake (7 segments) is manageable in the grid, with no tight spaces imminent.\n- **Alternative avoided**: Moving left at turn 20 (to (5,2)) does not eat food and may lead to missing (6,1), with no score gain. It also delays reaching (5,6).\n\nThis plan prioritizes survival and score over 5 turns, with flexibility for further moves toward (5,6).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 20: D \\\\\nTurn 21: L \\\\\nTurn 22: U \\\\\nTurn 23: L \\\\\nTurn 24: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 21. The grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates go from (0,0) to (7,7). There's an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: head at (6,1), then (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5). So the tail is at (6,5). The head is moving down, which is decreasing y, I think? Let's clarify the coordinate system.\n\nTypically in such grids, (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? The movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so if U increases y, that might mean y increases upwards, like in math coordinates. But in computer graphics, y often increases downwards. I need to be careful.\n\nThe head direction is D, which is down, defined as (x,y-1). So from (6,1), moving down would go to (6,0), but y=0 is a wall, so that's dangerous. But let's list the snake segments:\n\n- Head: (6,1)\n\n- Segment 1: (6,2)\n\n- Segment 2: (6,3)\n\n- Segment 3: (5,3)\n\n- Segment 4: (5,4)\n\n- Segment 5: (6,4)\n\n- Segment 6: (6,5)  // tail\n\nSince head is at (6,1) and direction is down, meaning it just moved to (6,1) from above? Direction D means the snake is facing down, so last move was down to (6,1).\n\nFood:\n\n- (1,6) with value 1, life span 5\n\n- (5,6) with value 1, life span 8\n\nBoth are positive food since value is +1.\n\nLife span: for (1,6), it disappears after 5 turns, including current turn, so it has 5 turns left including turn 21. Similarly, (5,6) has 8 turns left.\n\nI need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSo, let's list available cells.\n\nFor example, row y=0: all x, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so cells (1,0) to (6,0) are free, but y=0 is wall? \"Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\" so all cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n\nSimilarly, internal (4,6) is wall.\n\nSnake occupies:\n\n(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nFood at (1,6) and (5,6)\n\n(5,6) is at x=5,y=6, which is near the snake.\n\n(1,6) is at top-left if y increases up, or bottom-left? Let's define coordinate.\n\nSince U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), let's assume y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top, so increasing y is up.\n\nIn standard, if U is (x,y+1), that might mean y increases north, so y=0 south, y=7 north. But in the state, head at (6,1), moving down to y-1, so to (6,0), which is wall, so it can't move down.\n\nHead at (6,1), direction D, so it must have come from (6,2), since positions are head first: [(6,1), (6,2), ...] so head is at (6,1), which was just entered by moving down from (6,2)? Let's see the positions.\n\nPositions: head (6,1), then next is (6,2), which is above it since y=2 > y=1, so if y increases up, (6,2) is north of (6,1). Direction D means it was moving down, so from (6,2) to (6,1), decreasing y.\n\nSimilarly, from (6,2) to (6,3)? Positions: (6,1) head, then (6,2), then (6,3), so body segments follow, so the snake body is at (6,2), then (6,3), etc.\n\nThe order is head first, so the head is at index 0: (6,1), then segment 1 at (6,2), segment 2 at (6,3), segment 3 at (5,3), etc.\n\nSince head is at (6,1) and segment 1 at (6,2), which has higher y, so if y increases up, (6,2) is above (6,1), so the snake was moving down to (6,1), so direction is down.\n\nNow, from (6,1), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut direction is D, so it can't move opposite, which is U, immediately. No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is D, so cannot move U on this turn.\n\nAlso, walls: y=0 is bottom wall, so moving D to (6,0) is invalid, wall collision.\n\nSimilarly, x=0 left, x=7 right, y=7 top.\n\nSo from (6,1):\n\n- U: (6,1+1) = (6,2) but (6,2) is occupied by the snake body, segment 1. Moving there would cause collision with body.\n\n- D: (6,1-1) = (6,0), but y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n\n- L: (6-1,1) = (5,1)\n\n- R: (6+1,1) = (7,1), but x=7 is wall, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is L to (5,1).\n\nIs (5,1) free? Snake positions: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5). (5,1) is not listed, so it should be free. Also no wall there.\n\nFood? Food at (1,6) and (5,6), not (5,1).\n\nSo moving L to (5,1) is possible.\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, food life spans: (1,6) has life span 5, meaning it disappears after turn 21 + 5 - 1? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 21, life span 5, after turn 21 it becomes 4, then 3,2,1,0. When life span 0, it disappears, so it can be eaten until turn when life span is 1? Let's see.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo for food at turn t with life span L, it will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1? Let's think.\n\nAt turn t, life span L, after the turn, it decreases, so at start of turn t, life span L, after turn t, it becomes L-1.\n\nIt disappears when life span reaches 0, so it can be eaten on any turn when life span >0.\n\nFor example, at turn 21, life span 5, it can be eaten on turn 21,22,23,24,25? After turn 25, if not eaten, it disappears.\n\nStart turn 21: life span 5, if eaten, gone. If not, after turn 21, life span 4.\n\nTurn 22: life span 4, can be eaten, etc.\n\nAfter turn 25: life span 0, disappears before turn 26.\n\nSimilarly for (5,6), life span 8, so it will last until turn 21+8-1=28? Turn 21: L=8, after turn 21 L=7, turn 22 L=6, ..., turn 28 L=1, can be eaten on turn 28, after that L=0, gone.\n\nTurn t with L initial, last turn to eat is when L >=1, so turns from t to t+L-1 inclusive? Let's not complicate; both foods have multiple turns left.\n\nNow, back to possible moves.\n\nFrom (6,1), only L to (5,1) is possible, since U is body, D is wall, R is wall.\n\nU to (6,2) is body collision, yes.\n\nSo for turn 21, I must move L to (5,1).\n\nThen, after moving to (5,1), the snake will be: head at (5,1), then the body: since it moves, the tail moves forward, so the new positions: head to (5,1), then the previous head (6,1) becomes body, so body: (6,1), then (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), and tail (6,5) moves? When snake moves, the head moves to new cell, and the tail cell is vacated unless it eats food.\n\nNo food eaten here, so tail moves off.\n\nSnake positions after move: new head at (5,1), then the old head (6,1) becomes segment 1, then (6,2) segment 2, (6,3) segment 3, (5,3) segment 4, (5,4) segment 5, (6,4) segment 6, and the tail (6,5) is left, so the snake shortens? No.\n\nStandard snake: when no food eaten, head moves to new cell, tail is removed, so length same.\n\nPositions: current positions: [ (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) ] so 7 segments.\n\nAfter moving head to (5,1), the new head is (5,1), then the body is the first 6 of the previous positions: but since head moved, the body shifts.\n\nNew positions: head: (5,1)\n\nThen, the previous segments from index 0 to 5 become the body, but index 0 is old head, which is now body part.\n\nAfter move: head at new position, then the previous head becomes the new second segment, previous second becomes third, and so on, up to the previous second-to-last, and the last segment (tail) is removed.\n\nIn this case, positions: old: index 0: (6,1) head, 1: (6,2), 2: (6,3), 3: (5,3), 4: (5,4), 5: (6,4), 6: (6,5) tail.\n\nAfter move to (5,1): new head: (5,1)\n\nThen new segment 1: old head (6,1)\n\nNew segment 2: old segment 1 (6,2)\n\nNew segment 3: old segment 2 (6,3)\n\nNew segment 4: old segment 3 (5,3)\n\nNew segment 5: old segment 4 (5,4)\n\nNew segment 6: old segment 5 (6,4)  // since tail is removed, the last body segment is old segment 5, which was (6,4)\n\nOld had 7 positions, after move, 7 positions but tail moved.\n\nNew positions: [ (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4) ]\n\nThe tail was (6,5), which is removed, and (6,4) is now the tail? Let's list:\n\n- New head: (5,1)\n\n- New body: (6,1)  // from old head\n\n- Then (6,2)  // old seg1\n\n- Then (6,3)  // old seg2\n\n- Then (5,3)  // old seg3\n\n- Then (5,4)  // old seg4\n\n- Then (6,4)  // old seg5, and since old seg6 (6,5) is removed, (6,4) is the new tail.\n\nLength still 7, no growth.\n\nNow, head direction: moved left, so direction is now L.\n\nFrom (5,1), possible moves:\n\n- U: (5,1+1) = (5,2)\n\n- D: (5,1-1) = (5,0) but y=0 wall, invalid\n\n- L: (5-1,1) = (4,1)\n\n- R: (5+1,1) = (6,1) but (6,1) is now occupied by the snake body, segment 1, so collision if move there.\n\nAlso, cannot move opposite to current direction? Current direction is L (since just moved left), so cannot move R immediately.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,2), L to (4,1), D invalid, R invalid and opposite.\n\nNow, (5,2) and (4,1) should be free, no snake or wall.\n\nWalls: x=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 at y=0, etc., but (4,1) is x=4,y=1, not wall, similarly (5,2) ok.\n\nFood: not at these positions.\n\nNow, I need to think about getting to the food.\n\nFood at (1,6) and (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is closer, but let's see the grid.\n\nAlso, internal obstacle at (4,6), which is near (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is food, (4,6) is wall.\n\nThe snake is currently at bottom, around (5,1) after move.\n\nAfter turn 21 move to (5,1), positions: head at (5,1), body at (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)\n\nTail at (6,4)\n\nNow for turn 22, from (5,1), I can move U or L.\n\nI need to plan multiple turns.\n\nAlso, the food at (5,6) has life span 8, so plenty of time, but (1,6) has life span 5, so it might disappear sooner.\n\nLife span at turn 21: (1,6) L=5, so can be eaten until turn 25.\n\nTurn 21: L=5, after turn L=4\n\nTurn 22: L=4, after turn L=3\n\nTurn 23: L=3, after turn L=2\n\nTurn 24: L=2, after turn L=1\n\nTurn 25: L=1, can be eaten, after eaten or not, if not, after turn L=0, gone.\n\nSo last chance to eat (1,6) is turn 25.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) L=8, last chance turn 28.\n\nNow, the snake needs to navigate to one of these.\n\nBut there is a risk with the tail and food under body.\n\nFirst, let's list all current positions to avoid.\n\nAfter turn 21 move to (5,1), the grid has snake at: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)\n\nWalls at borders and (4,6)\n\nFood at (1,6) and (5,6)\n\n(5,6) is at x=5,y=6, which is not occupied by snake, but let's see if it's under body? Snake positions: (5,4) is at y=4, (6,4) at y=4, (5,3) y=3, etc. (5,6) is free, not under snake.\n\nSimilarly (1,6) free.\n\nBut (5,6) might be eaten, but we need to go there.\n\nNow from (5,1) at turn 22, I can move U to (5,2) or L to (4,1).\n\nIf I move U to (5,2), then head to (5,2), body: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)  // tail is (5,4)? After move, new head (5,2), body (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4) since (6,4) was tail, removed.\n\nPrevious positions after turn 21: [ (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4) ]\n\nAfter move to (5,2): new head (5,2), then (5,1) becomes body, then (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)  // and (6,4) removed, so tail at (5,4)\n\nSimilarly, if move L to (4,1), head to (4,1), body (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)  // tail (5,4)\n\n(5,4) is still there.\n\nNow, I need to get to the food. (5,6) is at (5,6), which is above, but there is (5,4) occupied, and (5,5) might be free.\n\nLet's think of a path to (5,6).\n\nFrom (5,1), if I go up, to (5,2), then to (5,3), but (5,3) is occupied by snake body.\n\nAt turn 22, from (5,1), if I move U to (5,2), then positions: head (5,2), body (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)  // (5,3) is occupied.\n\nThen from (5,2), possible moves:\n\nU to (5,3) but (5,3) is occupied by body, collision.\n\nD to (5,1) but (5,1) is body, collision, and also direction: after moving U, direction U, so cannot move D opposite.\n\nL to (4,2)\n\nR to (6,2) but (6,2) is occupied by body.\n\n(6,2) is in the body list.\n\nSo only L to (4,2) possible? (4,2) should be free.\n\nWalls? (4,2) not wall.\n\nThen from there, I can go up or left, etc.\n\nBut this seems messy. Let's think from the beginning with a plan.\n\nSince (1,6) has short life, I should go for it first if possible, but it's far, at (1,6), snake at (6,1), so distance |6-1| + |1-6| = 5+5=10, with obstacles, and I have only 4 turns to reach it by turn 25, but turn 21 to 25 is 5 turns? Turns: turn 21,22,23,24,25. 5 moves to reach (1,6) by turn 25.\n\nBut the snake is slow, and has to avoid itself.\n\nFrom current position, after moving to (5,1) at turn 21, I am at (5,1).\n\nThen to reach (1,6), I need to go left and up.\n\nBut there are walls and the snake body.\n\nFor example, from (5,1), I can move L to (4,1) at turn 22.\n\nThen from (4,1), I can move U to (4,2) or L to (3,1), etc.\n\nBut y=6 is top, so I need to go up.\n\nSimilarly, for (5,6), it's closer, at same x, y from 1 to 6, but the body is in the way.\n\nLet's list the free cells.\n\nGrid 8x8, walls at borders, so internal cells x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 walls, y=0 and y=7 walls, so free cells x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except internal wall at (4,6).\n\nx=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, but (4,6) is wall, so not free.\n\nAlso snake occupies some cells.\n\nAt turn 21 after move, snake at: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)\n\nSo occupied: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)\n\nFree cells: for example, (1,1) to (4,1), (1,2) to (4,2), (1,3) to (4,3), but (5,3) occupied, so (1,3) to (4,3) free? x=1 to 4, y=3.\n\nLet's list all free cells.\n\nx from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nBut (4,6) wall.\n\nSnake: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)\n\nSo occupied: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)\n\nAlso, (5,6) is food, free, (1,6) food free.\n\nOther free cells: for example, (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (5,6), (6,6)  // (4,6) wall, so not free.\n\n(5,5) is free? Snake has (5,4) and (6,4), but not (5,5), so yes free.\n\n(6,5) was tail but removed, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) free, etc.\n\nNow, from (5,1), I want to go to (5,6) or (1,6).\n\n(5,6) is at (5,6), which is above, but directly above, (5,2) is free, (5,3) occupied, so I can't go straight up.\n\nI need to go around.\n\nFor example, from (5,1), move L to (4,1) at turn 22.\n\nThen from (4,1), I can move U to (4,2) at turn 23.\n\nThen from (4,2), U to (4,3) at turn 24.\n\n(4,3) is free? Yes, not occupied.\n\nThen from (4,3), U to (4,4) at turn 25.\n\n(4,4) free.\n\nThen U to (4,5) at turn 26.\n\nThen U to (4,6) but (4,6) is wall, invalid.\n\nOh, (4,6) is wall, so I can't go to (4,6).\n\nFrom (4,3), I can go R to (5,3) but (5,3) occupied by snake.\n\nAt turn 24, if I am at (4,3), the snake body might have moved.\n\nI need to simulate the snake movement as I move.\n\nLet's plan a path to (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is at x=5,y=6.\n\nFrom current head (5,1) after turn 21 move.\n\nIf I go left to (4,1), then up to (4,2), then up to (4,3), then right to (5,3) but (5,3) is occupied now, but as the snake moves, it might be free later.\n\nLet's think turn by turn.\n\nTurn 21: must move L to (5,1) from (6,1). After move, positions: [ (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4) ] head at (5,1), direction L.\n\nTurn 22: from (5,1), I can move U or L.\n\nIf I move U to (5,2), then new head (5,2), body (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)  // tail at (5,4)\n\nNow from (5,2), possible moves: U to (5,3) but (5,3) is body, collision; D to (5,1) body, collision; L to (4,2); R to (6,2) body. Only L to (4,2) possible.\n\nMove L to (4,2).\n\nThen positions: head (4,2), body (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)  // tail at (5,3)\n\n(5,4) was tail, removed.\n\nNow head at (4,2), direction L (since moved left from (5,2)? From (5,2) to (4,2), so moved left.\n\nTurn 23: from (4,2), moves: U to (4,3), D to (4,1) but (4,1) is free? In body, (5,1) is body, but (4,1) is not occupied now. Positions: head (4,2), body (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\n(4,1) is free, (4,3) free, etc.\n\nU to (4,3), D to (4,1), L to (3,2), R to (5,2) but (5,2) is body, collision.\n\nAlso, direction L, so cannot move R opposite.\n\nPossible: U, D, L.\n\nIf move U to (4,3), then head (4,3), body (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)  // tail at (6,3)\n\n(5,3) was tail, removed.\n\nNow head at (4,3), direction U.\n\nTurn 24: from (4,3), moves: U to (4,4), D to (4,2) but (4,2) is body, collision; L to (3,3), R to (5,3) but (5,3) is free now? In positions, (6,3) is body, but (5,3) not occupied, so R to (5,3) possible.\n\nAlso, direction U, so cannot move D opposite.\n\nPossible: U to (4,4), L to (3,3), R to (5,3)\n\n(5,3) is free, yes.\n\nIf I want to go to (5,6), I can move R to (5,3).\n\nThen head to (5,3), body (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)  // tail at (6,2)\n\nNow head at (5,3), direction R.\n\nTurn 25: from (5,3), moves: U to (5,4), D to (5,2) but (5,2) is body, collision; L to (4,3) but (4,3) is body, collision; R to (6,3) but (6,3) is body, collision.\n\nAll moves except U are invalid or collision.\n\nU to (5,4): is (5,4) free? In positions, (6,2) is body, but (5,4) not listed, so free.\n\nMove U to (5,4).\n\nPositions: head (5,4), body (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1)  // tail at (6,1)\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 26: from (5,4), moves: U to (5,5), D to (5,3) but (5,3) body, collision; L to (4,4), R to (6,4)\n\n(5,3) is body, so D invalid.\n\nL to (4,4), R to (6,4) both possible.\n\n(5,5) free, (4,4) free, (6,4) free.\n\nIf move U to (5,5), then head (5,5), body (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1)  // tail at (5,1)\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 27: from (5,5), moves: U to (5,6), which is food! D to (5,4) body, collision; L to (4,5), R to (6,5)\n\nU to (5,6) is possible, and it has food.\n\n(5,6) has food, value +1.\n\nIf I move U, I eat the food, so the snake grows.\n\nWhen eating food, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail does not move, so length increases by 1.\n\nIn this case, turn 27, move U to (5,6), eat food, so new head at (5,6), and the tail does not move, so new positions: head (5,6), then the previous head (5,5) becomes new segment, then the body as before, but tail not removed.\n\nAfter move without eat: head to new, tail removed.\n\nWith eat: head to new, tail stays, so new segment added.\n\nSo positions before move turn 27: head (5,5), body (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1)\n\nMove to (5,6), eat food, so new positions: head (5,6), then (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1)  // 8 segments, tail at (5,1)\n\nNow, I have eaten (5,6) at turn 27.\n\nBut what about (1,6)? It has life span 5, at turn 21, so by turn 25 it must be eaten, but in this plan, at turn 25 I was at (5,4), not near (1,6).\n\nTurn 21: move to (5,1)\n\nTurn 22: move to (4,2) in my earlier step? Let's list the turns.\n\nIn the plan:\n\nTurn 21: move L to (5,1)\n\nTurn 22: move U to (5,2) — but from (5,1) to (5,2) is U, but in turn 22 from (5,1), I moved U to (5,2)\n\nThen turn 23: from (5,2) only L to (4,2)\n\nTurn 24: from (4,2) move U to (4,3)\n\nTurn 25: from (4,3) move R to (5,3)\n\nTurn 26: from (5,3) move U to (5,4)\n\nTurn 27: from (5,4) move U to (5,5)? Earlier I said from (5,4) to (5,5) at turn 26? I think I confused.\n\nLet's list positions after each turn.\n\nStart turn 21: positions [ (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) ] head (6,1) dir D\n\nTurn 21 action: must move L to (5,1)\n\nAfter move: head (5,1), body: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)  // tail (6,4) since (6,5) removed\n\nPositions: [ (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4) ]\n\nTurn 22: from (5,1), move U to (5,2) — (5,2) is free\n\nAfter move: head (5,2), body: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)  // tail (5,4)\n\nTurn 23: from (5,2), only possible move L to (4,2) — (4,2) free\n\nAfter move: head (4,2), body: (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)  // tail (5,3)\n\nTurn 24: from (4,2), move U to (4,3) — (4,3) free\n\nAfter move: head (4,3), body: (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)  // tail (6,3)\n\nTurn 25: from (4,3), I can move U to (4,4), L to (3,3), or R to (5,3)\n\n(5,3) is free, as not in body.\n\nMove R to (5,3)\n\nAfter move: head (5,3), body: (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)  // tail (6,2)\n\nTurn 26: from (5,3), only possible move U to (5,4) — since D,L,R all collision or invalid.\n\nD to (5,2) body, L to (4,3) body, R to (6,3) body, U to (5,4) free.\n\nAfter move: head (5,4), body: (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1)  // tail (6,1)\n\nTurn 27: from (5,4), I can move U to (5,5), L to (4,4), R to (6,4)\n\n(5,5) free, (4,4) free, (6,4) free.\n\nIf move U to (5,5)\n\nAfter move: head (5,5), body: (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1)  // tail (5,1)\n\nNo food eaten, so tail removed? Positions: new head (5,5), body (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1) — 7 segments.\n\nThen turn 28: from (5,5), move U to (5,6) to eat food.\n\nAfter move: head to (5,6), eat food, so tail not removed, new positions: head (5,6), then (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1) — 8 segments.\n\nBut (5,6) was eaten at turn 28.\n\nLife span of (5,6) was 8 at turn 21, turn 28: life span decreases each turn, at turn 21 L=8, turn 22 L=7, ..., turn 28 L=1, so it can be eaten on turn 28.\n\nBut (1,6) with L=5 at turn 21, turn 25 L=1, turn 26 L=0 gone. In this plan, at turn 25, I am at (5,3), not near (1,6), so (1,6) disappears uneaten.\n\nBut I could go for (1,6) first.\n\nFrom turn 21, after move to (5,1), at turn 22, instead of moving U, move L to (4,1).\n\nTurn 21: after move to (5,1), positions [ (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4) ]\n\nTurn 22: move L to (4,1)\n\nAfter move: head (4,1), body: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)  // tail (5,4)\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 23: from (4,1), moves: U to (4,2), D to (4,0) invalid, L to (3,1), R to (5,1) body, collision. Cannot move R opposite. So possible U or L.\n\nMove U to (4,2)\n\nAfter move: head (4,2), body: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)  // tail (5,3)\n\nTurn 24: from (4,2), move U to (4,3)\n\nAfter move: head (4,3), body: (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)  // tail (6,3)\n\nTurn 25: from (4,3), move U to (4,4)\n\nAfter move: head (4,4), body: (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)  // tail (6,2)\n\n(4,4) is free.\n\nNow at turn 25, I am at (4,4), and (1,6) is at (1,6), which is left and up.\n\nBut to reach (1,6) on turn 25, I need to be there.\n\nFrom (4,4) at turn 25, I can move L to (3,4), U to (4,5), etc., but (1,6) is 3 left and 2 up, so I need to move fast.\n\nTurn 25: from (4,4), move L to (3,4) if possible.\n\n(3,4) free? Not occupied, yes.\n\nAfter move: head (3,4), body: (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)  // tail (6,1)\n\nTurn 26: from (3,4), move L to (2,4) or U to (3,5), etc.\n\nBut (1,6) is gone after turn 25, since at turn 25 L=1, if not eaten, after turn 25 it disappears. So on turn 25, I must be at (1,6) to eat it.\n\nAt turn 25, I am at (4,4), not at (1,6), so I cannot eat (1,6) in this path.\n\nFrom earlier positions, it's hard to reach (1,6) by turn 25 because it's far and the snake is slow.\n\nFor example, from (5,1) at turn 21, to (1,6), Manhattan distance |5-1| + |1-6| = 4 + 5 = 9, and in 4 moves (turns 22,23,24,25), I need to cover 9 units, impossible since each move is one step. Manhattan distance 9, min moves 9, but only 4 moves, impossible.\n\nTurns to move: turn 22,23,24,25: 4 moves to reach on turn 25.\n\nBut distance is at least 4 in x and 5 in y, so min 9 moves required, so impossible to reach (1,6) by turn 25.\n\nTherefore, I should not try to eat (1,6), focus on (5,6).\n\nSimilarly, in the first plan, I can eat (5,6) around turn 27-28.\n\nBut in the first plan, I ate at turn 28.\n\nNow, back to the tail reward danger.\n\nIn the food description, \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn this case, when I eat (5,6), the tail is at (5,1), far away, so no danger.\n\nBut I need to check if there is food under the body.\n\nCurrently, no food under body; both foods are free.\n\nBut in the future, when moving, might have.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (4,6), which is wall, so I need to avoid it.\n\nIn the first plan, when I go to (5,6), it's fine.\n\nNow, for turn 21, I must move L to (5,1).\n\nThen for turn 22, I need to choose move.\n\nIn the first plan, I moved U to (5,2), then L to (4,2), etc.\n\nBut at turn 22, from (5,1), I could move L to (4,1) instead.\n\nThen I can go left and up to explore or something.\n\nBut to reach (5,6), moving U from (5,1) might be better.\n\nFrom (5,1), move U to (5,2), then I had to move L to (4,2), etc., but that took many turns.\n\nIs there a shorter path to (5,6)?\n\nFrom (5,1), directly up is blocked by body at (5,3) and (5,4).\n\n(5,2) is free, but (5,3) occupied.\n\nI need to go around the left or right.\n\nRight is wall at x=7, so left is better.\n\nFrom (5,1), move L to (4,1) at turn 22.\n\nThen from (4,1), move U to (4,2) turn 23.\n\nThen U to (4,3) turn 24.\n\nThen U to (4,4) turn 25.\n\nThen U to (4,5) turn 26.\n\nThen from (4,5), I can move U to (4,6) but (4,6) wall, invalid.\n\nOr move R to (5,5) or L to (3,5), etc.\n\nThen to (5,6), from (4,5) move R to (5,5) turn 27, then U to (5,6) turn 28.\n\nSame as before.\n\nFrom (4,4) turn 25, move R to (5,4) but (5,4) might be occupied or not.\n\nIn the body, but as snake moves, it might be free.\n\nFor example, at turn 25, from (4,4) in this path, positions: let's not simulate all, it will take similar time.\n\nSo to eat (5,6) around turn 28 is fine.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nCurrent turn 21, so I need actions for turn 21,22,23,24,25, etc.\n\nBut the state is at turn 21, so action for turn 21 is first.\n\nTurn 21: move L to (5,1), as must.\n\nThen for turn 22, from (5,1), I can move U or L.\n\nIn the first plan, I moved U to (5,2), which led to eating food later.\n\nIf I move L to (4,1), it might take longer or similar.\n\nBut moving U might be better to go up faster.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nFor example, if I go to (4,1), then up, but the area on the left might have more space.\n\nBut since I want to go to (5,6), going up from (5,1) is direct, but blocked, so I have to go left first.\n\nNow, another thing: after eating (5,6), I can go for other food or survive.\n\nBut currently only two foods, and (1,6) will be gone soon.\n\nPerhaps I should plan the actions.\n\nSince the answer format is to list actions for several turns, I can list from turn 21 to, say, turn 25 or 26.\n\nBut I need to think 5+ turns ahead, so at least to turn 26.\n\nTurn 21 to 26 is 6 turns.\n\nNow, based on the first plan:\n\nTurn 21: L (to (5,1))\n\nTurn 22: U (to (5,2))\n\nBut after turn 22 move to (5,2), then from (5,2), I must move L to (4,2) because other moves invalid.\n\nIn turn 23: from (5,2) only L possible, as above.\n\nThen turn 24: from (4,2) move U to (4,3)\n\nThen turn 25: from (4,3) I can move to (4,4) or (3,3) or (5,3)\n\nIn the plan, I moved R to (5,3) to go towards (5,6).\n\nI could move U to (4,4) or L to (3,3), but (3,3) is left, away from food.\n\nSo better to move R to (5,3).\n\nThen turn 26: from (5,3) move U to (5,4)\n\nThen beyond, but for answer, I can list up to turn 26.\n\nNow, for turn 21, action is L.\n\nThen turn 22, action U.\n\nThen turn 23, action L (to (4,2))\n\nThen turn 24, action U (to (4,3))\n\nThen turn 25, action R (to (5,3))\n\nThen turn 26, action U (to (5,4))\n\nAnd later to (5,5) and (5,6).\n\nNow, in this, I need to confirm if all moves are safe.\n\nFor example, at turn 25, moving to (5,3), is it free? At that time, yes.\n\nSimilarly, no immediate risks.\n\nAlso, the tail danger: no food under tail, so ok.\n\nNow, about the food under body: currently no, but in future, as snake moves, cells might have food, but in this case, foods are at (1,6) and (5,6), not in the path.\n\n(5,6) will be eaten later.\n\nSo this seems a plan.\n\nTo maximize score, eating (5,6) gives +1, and I survive.\n\n(1,6) cannot be eaten, so no choice.\n\nPerhaps I can go for (1,6) if possible, but as calculated, impossible to reach by turn 25.\n\nDistance from (5,1) to (1,6) is |5-1| + |1-6| = 4+5=9, and turns 22,23,24,25: 4 moves, min 9 steps needed, impossible. So yes.\n\nTherefore, the plan is to go for (5,6).\n\nSo for answer:\n\nTurn 21: L\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: L\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: R\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nBut turn 23 is L to (4,2), turn 24 U to (4,3), turn 25 R to (5,3), turn 26 U to (5,4)\n\nNow, I should list actions for 5 turns or more.\n\nCurrent turn 21, so actions for turn 21,22,23,24,25.\n\nTurn 21 to 25 inclusive.\n\nThen I can add turn 26 if needed, but the format says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so at least 5 future actions, but actions starting from current turn.\n\n\"Turn \\(t_1\\): action on turn t_1\" so from t1 onwards.\n\nt1=21, so actions for turn 21,22,23,24,25,26 for example.\n\n5 actions: 21 to 25, or 21 to 26? 21 is current, then 22,23,24,25 are 4 future, so 5 turns would be 21 to 25, 5 actions.\n\nTurn 21,22,23,24,25: 5 turns.\n\nBut thinking ahead, I have actions up to 26.\n\nIn the answer, I can list from 21 to 25.\n\nAt turn 25, I am at (5,3) in this plan.\n\nThen to continue, I need to go to (5,4), (5,5), (5,6).\n\nBut for the answer, listing up to turn 25 is fine, as I have a plan.\n\nTo be complete, list to turn 26.\n\nNow, in the actions, for turn 23, I have L, but from where?\n\nIn turn 22, I moved U to (5,2), then at turn 23, from (5,2) only L possible, so it's determined.\n\nSimilarly, others have choices, but I chose to go towards food.\n\nNow, another option: at turn 22, from (5,1), instead of U, I move L to (4,1).\n\nThen turn 23: from (4,1) move U to (4,2)\n\nTurn 24: from (4,2) move U to (4,3)\n\nTurn 25: from (4,3) move U to (4,4)\n\nThen at turn 25, I am at (4,4), which is farther from (5,6) than (5,3).\n\nFrom (4,4) to (5,6) is |4-5| + |4-6| =1+2=3 moves, whereas from (5,3) to (5,6) is |3-6|=3 moves in y, but I can go to (5,4), (5,5), (5,6) in 3 moves.\n\nFrom (5,3) to (5,6) in 3 moves: to (5,4), (5,5), (5,6).\n\nSimilarly, from (4,4) to (5,6): e.g., to (5,4) then (5,5) then (5,6), or directly if possible, but not adjacent diagonal, so same 3 moves.\n\nBut from (5,3) it's closer in x.\n\nIn terms of path, similar.\n\nBut in the first choice, by moving U at turn 22, I go up faster, and by turn 25 I am at (5,3), which is at y=3, while if I move L first, at turn 25 I am at (4,4), y=4, but x=4, so need to go right.\n\nBut both ok.\n\nI think moving U at turn 22 is fine.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 21: L\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: L\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: R\n\nAnd for thinking ahead, turn 26: U to (5,4)\n\nBut for answer, list from 21 to 25.\n\nThe format says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so probably list multiple actions.\n\nAlso, in the box.\n\nSo for turn 21: action L\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: L\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: R\n\nAnd I can add Turn 26: U for completeness.\n\nSince the state is at turn 21, action for turn 21 is immediate.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score by eating the positive food at (5,6) while ensuring long-term survival, a sequence of moves is planned considering the grid constraints, food life spans, and snake body positions. The food at (1,6) has a life span of 5 (disappearing after turn 25) and is too far to reach safely by turn 25 (Manhattan distance 9 from (5,1) requires at least 9 moves, but only 4 moves are available from turn 22 to 25). Thus, the focus is on reaching (5,6) by turn 28, which has a life span of 8 (last chance on turn 28). \n\nThe planned path avoids collisions and dead ends:\n- Turn 21: Only possible move is L (to (5,1)) due to walls and body blocks.\n- Turn 22: Move U (to (5,2)) to ascend toward (5,6), as moving L would delay vertical progress.\n- Turn 23: Only possible move is L (to (4,2)) due to body blocks in other directions.\n- Turn 24: Move U (to (4,3)) to continue ascending.\n- Turn 25: Move R (to (5,3)) to align with the x-coordinate of (5,6).\n- Turn 26: Move U (to (5,4)) to continue toward (5,6).\n\nThis sequence ensures the snake reaches (5,4) by turn 26, setting up for (5,5) on turn 27 and (5,6) on turn 28 to eat the food. The path is safe, with no food under the tail causing collision risk, and all moves are valid (no wall or body collisions).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 21: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 22: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 23: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 24: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 25: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 26: U (up)\n}",

        "score": 6,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 22, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n\nThe walls are given as: Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. That means any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall, so the snake can only be on cells where 1≤x≤6 and 1≤y≤6. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nNow, snake positions: head is at (5,1), then body segments: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4). So the snake has 7 segments. Head direction is left, meaning it was moving left to reach (5,1) from... let's see the positions: before head (5,1) was at (6,1), since it moved left from (6,1) to (5,1). Direction is the current head direction, which is L, so it just moved left to (5,1).\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (1,6) with life span 4, value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (5,6) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (3,4) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, value 1, so no negative food here. Good.\n\nI need to plan moves for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns. But the answer format should show actions starting from turn 22 onwards, so I need to decide the sequence of moves.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid for clarity. Grid size: 8x8, but walls at borders, so playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. Internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- Head: (5,1)\n\n- Body: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)\n\nLet's list all positions:\n\n- Segment 0 (head): (5,1)\n\n- Segment 1: (6,1)\n\n- Segment 2: (6,2)\n\n- Segment 3: (6,3)\n\n- Segment 4: (5,3)\n\n- Segment 5: (5,4)\n\n- Segment 6 (tail): (6,4)\n\nHead direction is L, so it moved left to (5,1), and before that it was at (6,1), which is segment 1 now.\n\nSince head direction is L, I cannot move right immediately because of no instant reverse. So possible moves from (5,1) are up, down, or left, but not right.\n\nNow, current position: (5,1)\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Up (U): to (5,2)\n\n- Down (D): to (5,0), but y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n\n- Left (L): to (4,1)\n\n- Right (R): to (6,1), but (6,1) is occupied by body segment 1, and also, since I just moved left, moving right would be reverse, which is not allowed. So right is invalid for two reasons: body collision and reverse move.\n\nDown to (5,0) is wall, invalid.\n\nSo only possible moves from here are Up to (5,2) or Left to (4,1).\n\nNow, I need to think about food and survival.\n\nFood locations:\n\n- (1,6): life span 4, so it will disappear after 4 more turns, including current? Life span decreases every turn, including current turn, so at turn 22, life span is 4, meaning it will disappear after turn 25? Let's clarify.\n\nLife span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nSo at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear at turn t + L - 1? Let's think.\n\nIf life span is N at turn t, after this turn (turn t), life span becomes N-1. After turn t+1, N-2, and so on, until life span 0, it disappears before the next turn or after? The countdown decreases every turn including current, so at the start of turn t, life span is N, after the turn, it decreases to N-1. When life span reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n\nThe rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\".\n\nI think it's: at the beginning of turn t, food has life span L. After the turn, if L > 1, it remains with L-1; if L=1, after the turn it disappears, so not available for next turn.\n\nSimilarly, for eating: if head moves to food cell during the turn, it eats it.\n\nFor (1,6): at turn 22, life span=4, so after turn 22, life span=3; after turn 23, life span=2; after turn 24, life span=1; after turn 25, life span=0, disappears, so not available on turn 26.\n\nIt can be eaten on turns 22,23,24,25.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6): life span=7, can be eaten until turn 28.\n\n(3,4): life span=10, until turn 31.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves to maximize score, but prioritize survival.\n\nFirst, from (5,1), I can go to (5,2) or (4,1).\n\n(5,2) is currently empty? Let's see the snake positions: snake is at (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4). So (5,2) is not occupied, I think. Is it?\n\nPositions: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4). So (5,2) is free? y=2, x=5.\n\n(5,2) is not in the list, so yes, empty.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) is not in list, empty.\n\nAlso, walls: no walls at (5,2) or (4,1), since walls are at borders and (4,6) internal.\n\n(4,1) is within 1-6, no wall.\n\nNow, moving to (5,2): that would be up.\n\nOr to (4,1): left.\n\nIf I move up to (5,2), new head position (5,2), and the body will follow: the tail (6,4) will move, so the cell (5,1) becomes empty? No, when snake moves, the head moves to new position, each segment moves to the next position, and the tail leaves its position.\n\nSo after moving up to (5,2), new positions: head (5,2), then (5,1) becomes segment 1, (6,1) segment 2, (6,2) segment 3, (6,3) segment 4, (5,3) segment 5, (5,4) segment 6, and tail (6,4) is gone, so (6,4) is now empty.\n\nSimilarly, if I move left to (4,1), new head (4,1), then (5,1) segment 1, (6,1) segment 2, etc., tail (6,4) gone.\n\nNow, I need to think about food.\n\nThe food at (1,6) is far away, at turn 22, life span 4, so I need to get there soon if I want to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) is close, at same x, y=6, but y=6 is not wall? y=6 is within 1-6, but internal obstacle at (4,6), but (5,6) is different.\n\n(5,6) is at x=5,y=6.\n\ny=6 is not wall, since walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) and (3,4).\n\n(3,4) is also food.\n\nNow, from (5,1), if I go up to (5,2), I'm moving towards the center.\n\nIf I go left to (4,1), I'm moving left.\n\nBut (4,1) is close to left wall, x=1.\n\nI need to avoid risks, like getting trapped.\n\nAlso, the tail: when I move, the tail moves, so cells might free up.\n\nCurrently, the tail is at (6,4), which will move when I move.\n\nNow, for the food at (5,6), it's at (5,6), which is above.\n\nFrom (5,1), to reach (5,6), I need to go up, but there are obstacles.\n\nLet me sketch the grid mentally.\n\nRows y=1 to 6, columns x=1 to 6.\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- (5,1): head\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (6,2)\n\n- (6,3)\n\n- (5,3) — here (5,3) is occupied, but if I go to (5,2), it might be ok.\n\n(5,3) is a body segment now.\n\nIf I move up to (5,2), then (5,2) is head, and (5,1) is body, (6,1) body, etc.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (5,3), but (5,3) is currently occupied by segment 4? Positions: after move to (5,2), positions: head (5,2), seg1 (5,1), seg2 (6,1), seg3 (6,2), seg4 (6,3), seg5 (5,3), seg6 (5,4), and (6,4) gone.\n\nSo (5,3) is now seg5, occupied.\n\nIf I am at (5,2), I cannot go to (5,3) because it's occupied by body.\n\nSimilarly, I can go to (4,2), (6,2), or (5,1) but (5,1) is now body, occupied.\n\nFrom (5,2), possible moves:\n\n- Up to (5,3): but (5,3) is seg5, occupied, so collision if I go there.\n\n- Down to (5,1): but (5,1) is seg1, occupied, and also, if I just moved up to (5,2), moving down would be reverse, not allowed.\n\n- Left to (4,2)\n\n- Right to (6,2): but (6,2) is seg3, occupied? After move, (6,2) is seg3, so occupied.\n\nAfter moving to (5,2), the positions are:\n\n- Head: (5,2)\n\n- Seg1: (5,1)  // previous head\n\n- Seg2: (6,1)  // was seg1\n\n- Seg3: (6,2)  // was seg2\n\n- Seg4: (6,3)  // was seg3\n\n- Seg5: (5,3)  // was seg4\n\n- Seg6: (5,4)  // was seg5, and (6,4) was tail, gone.\n\nSo cells occupied: (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)\n\nFrom head at (5,2), I can move:\n\n- U to (5,3): but (5,3) is occupied by seg5, so collision, death.\n\n- D to (5,1): (5,1) occupied by seg1, collision, and also reverse move if I just came from (5,1)? I moved from (5,1) to (5,2), so moving back to (5,1) is reverse, not allowed anyway.\n\n- L to (4,2): possible, if empty.\n\n- R to (6,2): (6,2) occupied by seg3, collision.\n\nSo only possible move from (5,2) is left to (4,2).\n\n(4,2) is not in occupied list, so should be empty, and no wall.\n\nThen from there, I can go to other places.\n\nBut if I go to (5,2) now, I'm forced to go to (4,2) next, which might not be ideal.\n\nIf I go left first from (5,1) to (4,1).\n\nThen new head (4,1), positions: head (4,1), seg1 (5,1), seg2 (6,1), seg3 (6,2), seg4 (6,3), seg5 (5,3), seg6 (5,4), tail (6,4) gone.\n\nFrom (4,1), possible moves:\n\n- U to (4,2)\n\n- D to (4,0), but y=0 wall, invalid\n\n- L to (3,1)\n\n- R to (5,1): but (5,1) is seg1, occupied, and also, if I just moved left from (5,1) to (4,1), moving right is reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo possible: U to (4,2) or L to (3,1).\n\n(3,1) is closer to the left, (4,2) is up.\n\nNow, food at (3,4) is at x=3,y=4, which is not far.\n\n(1,6) at x=1,y=6.\n\n(5,6) at x=5,y=6.\n\nBut (5,6) might be tricky because of the internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), so (4,6) is blocked.\n\nNow, to eat (5,6), from current position, I need to go up.\n\nBut from (5,1), if I go up to (5,2), then I'm stuck, must go left to (4,2), then from there I can go up or left, etc.\n\nBut let's think about the food life span.\n\nFood at (1,6) has life span 4, so if I want to eat it, I need to reach it by turn 25 at latest.\n\nTurn 22 now, so 3 moves to get there? From (5,1) to (1,6), Manhattan distance |5-1| + |1-6| = 4 + 5 = 9, which is more than 3 moves, so I can't reach it in time for sure. Life span 4, can be eaten on turns 22,23,24,25.\n\nFrom (5,1) to (1,6) is min 9 moves, impossible in 4 turns. So I should ignore (1,6), it will disappear soon.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) is at (5,6), from (5,1), vertical distance 5, so min 5 moves to go up, but with obstacles.\n\n(5,6) life span 7, so plenty of time.\n\n(3,4) life span 10, also plenty.\n\nSo focus on (5,6) and (3,4).\n\n(5,6) is closer vertically.\n\nBut there is the snake body in the way.\n\nFrom (5,1), if I go up to (5,2), then I can only go left to (4,2), as we saw.\n\nThen from (4,2), I can go up to (4,3), or left to (4,1) but (4,1) might be occupied? After moving to (4,2), positions depend.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nFirst, at turn 22, I need to choose action.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (5,2)\n\nThen turn 23: from (5,2), only possible move is L to (4,2)\n\nNow positions after turn 23: head at (4,2), body: seg1 (5,2), seg2 (5,1), seg3 (6,1), seg4 (6,2), seg5 (6,3), seg6 (5,3), and (5,4) gone? Let's track:\n\nAfter turn 22 move U to (5,2):\n\n- Head: (5,2)\n\n- Seg1: (5,1)\n\n- Seg2: (6,1)\n\n- Seg3: (6,2)\n\n- Seg4: (6,3)\n\n- Seg5: (5,3)\n\n- Seg6: (5,4)  // tail, so when we move next, it will be cut off.\n\nAt turn 23, move L to (4,2):\n\nNew head (4,2), then seg1 is previous head (5,2), seg2 (5,1), seg3 (6,1), seg4 (6,2), seg5 (6,3), seg6 (5,3), and (5,4) is left, so tail gone.\n\nSo positions: (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\n(5,4) is free now.\n\nFrom (4,2), head direction is left? I moved left to (4,2), so direction L.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U to (4,3)\n\n- D to (4,1): but (4,1) is not occupied? In positions above, (4,1) is not listed, so empty.\n\n- L to (3,2)\n\n- R to (5,2): but (5,2) is seg1, occupied, and moving right would be reverse since I just moved left to (4,2) from (5,2)? I moved from (5,2) to (4,2), so from (5,2) to (4,2) is left, so moving right to (5,2) is reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo possible: U to (4,3), D to (4,1), or L to (3,2).\n\n(4,3) might be occupied? Positions have (6,3) and (5,3), but (4,3) not listed, so empty.\n\n(4,1) empty, (3,2) empty.\n\nNow, food at (3,4) is at y=4, x=3.\n\nFrom (4,2), I can go up to (4,3), then to (4,4), but (4,4) is free? Not occupied yet.\n\nBut (3,4) is food, so from (4,3) I can go left to (3,3) or something.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst option at turn 22: move U, then forced to (4,2) at turn 23.\n\nThen at turn 23, I have choices.\n\nBut I need to consider the other initial choice.\n\nOption 2 at turn 22: move L to (4,1)\n\nThen positions: head (4,1), seg1 (5,1), seg2 (6,1), seg3 (6,2), seg4 (6,3), seg5 (5,3), seg6 (5,4), tail (6,4) gone.\n\nFrom (4,1), direction L (since moved left).\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U to (4,2)\n\n- D to (4,0) invalid\n\n- L to (3,1)\n\n- R to (5,1) occupied and reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo U to (4,2) or L to (3,1).\n\n(3,1) is bottom-left corner area.\n\n(4,2) is as before.\n\nNow, comparing the two options.\n\nIf I go left to (4,1) first, I can then go to (3,1) or (4,2).\n\nIf I go up to (5,2) first, I end up at (4,2) after two moves, but with different body positions.\n\nIn the first case (U then L), at turn 23 I am at (4,2) with positions: (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nIn the second case (L first), if I move L to (4,1) at turn 22, then at turn 23 if I move U to (4,2), positions: head (4,2), seg1 (4,1), seg2 (5,1), seg3 (6,1), seg4 (6,2), seg5 (6,3), seg6 (5,3), and (5,4) gone.\n\nSo body is different.\n\nSpecifically, in first case, when at (4,2), the cell (5,2) is occupied, and (4,1) is free.\n\nIn second case, when at (4,2), (4,1) is occupied.\n\nBut for movement, from (4,2) I can go U, D, L as before.\n\nNow, for food, (3,4) is at (3,4), which I can reach from left or below.\n\n(5,6) is at (5,6), which is top-right.\n\nBut internal obstacle at (4,6), so to reach (5,6), I need to approach from below or sides.\n\nSince (4,6) is blocked, I can go to (5,6) from (5,5), (6,6), (5,7) but y=7 wall, or (4,5) but (4,6) blocked, so from (4,5) I can't go to (4,6).\n\nAccess to (5,6): from (5,5), (6,6), or (4,6) but (4,6) is obstacle, so only from (5,5) or (6,6).\n\n(6,6) is within grid? x=6,y=6, walls at x=7,y=7, so (6,6) is playable.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) is playable.\n\nNow, currently, the snake body is at (5,3) and (5,4), so (5,5) and (5,6) are free.\n\nBut to go to (5,6), I need to go up from (5,5), for example.\n\nBut from current position (5,1), it's far.\n\n(3,4) is closer.\n\nLet's plan to go for (3,4) first, since it's nearer and life span is long.\n\nFrom (5,1), if I move left to (4,1), then I can go up to (4,2), then to (4,3), then to (4,4), then left to (3,4) to eat.\n\nBut at (4,4), I can go left to (3,4).\n\nBut need to check if paths are clear.\n\nFirst, at turn 22, move L to (4,1).\n\nThen turn 23, from (4,1), I can move U to (4,2).\n\nPositions after turn 22 move L: head (4,1), body (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)  // seg6 is (5,4), tail.\n\nAfter move U to (4,2) at turn 23: new head (4,2), seg1 (4,1), seg2 (5,1), seg3 (6,1), seg4 (6,2), seg5 (6,3), seg6 (5,3), and (5,4) gone.\n\nSo positions: (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nNow from (4,2), I can move U to (4,3) at turn 24.\n\n(4,3) is empty? Yes.\n\nMove to (4,3): new head (4,3), seg1 (4,2), seg2 (4,1), seg3 (5,1), seg4 (6,1), seg5 (6,2), seg6 (6,3), and (5,3) gone? (5,3) was seg6, so gone.\n\nPositions: (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\n(5,3) free.\n\nThen at turn 24, after moving to (4,3), I can move U to (4,4) at turn 25.\n\n(4,4) should be empty.\n\nMove to (4,4): new head (4,4), seg1 (4,3), seg2 (4,2), seg3 (4,1), seg4 (5,1), seg5 (6,1), seg6 (6,2), and (6,3) gone.\n\nThen from (4,4), I can move L to (3,4) to eat the food at turn 26.\n\nBut the food at (3,4) has life span 10 at turn 22, so at turn 26, how many turns passed? From turn 22 to 26, 4 turns, so life span decreases by 4, from 10 to 6, still available.\n\nAt turn 22, life span 10, after turn 22, 9; after 23,8; after 24,7; after 25,6; after 26,5, so on turn 26, life span is 5 when I move, I eat it, so it's fine.\n\nBut I eat at turn 26, which is after 4 moves from now.\n\nTurn 22 to 26 is 4 actions: turn 22,23,24,25,26? Turns: turn 22 action, turn 23,24,25,26.\n\nAfter turn 22 action, it's turn 23, etc.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 22: move to (4,1)\n\nTurn 23: move to (4,2)\n\nTurn 24: move to (4,3)\n\nTurn 25: move to (4,4)\n\nTurn 26: move to (3,4) and eat.\n\nYes.\n\nBut at turn 25, I am at (4,4), and move to (3,4) at turn 26.\n\nNow, is there any risk?\n\nAt (4,4), when I move to (3,4), it should be fine, as long as (3,4) is not occupied, which it isn't, and no wall.\n\nBut the food at (3,4) is there, so I eat it.\n\nNow, what about the head direction: when I move left to (3,4), direction L.\n\nBut I need to think if this is safe.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows, so after eating at (3,4), the tail doesn't move, so new positions: head at (3,4), and the body segments, with tail staying, so length increases by one.\n\nBut in this case, since I eat at (3,4), the new tail will be added, so positions: head (3,4), then seg1 (4,4), seg2 (4,3), seg3 (4,2), seg4 (4,1), seg5 (5,1), seg6 (6,1), seg7 (6,2), and since I ate, the tail (6,2) stays, so new segment at (6,2)? Let's see.\n\nBefore eating at turn 26: positions before move: head at (4,4), body (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)  // from earlier.\n\nWhen I move head to (3,4), and since I eat food, the tail does not move, so new head (3,4), then the body: seg1 (4,4), seg2 (4,3), seg3 (4,2), seg4 (4,1), seg5 (5,1), seg6 (6,1), and seg7 (6,2) (the previous tail stays).\n\nSo snake is now 8 segments long.\n\nThen I need to move from there.\n\nBut first, back to turn 22.\n\nIn this plan, I go directly to (3,4) via left and up.\n\nBut what about the other food? (5,6) is still there, I can go for it later.\n\nBut let's see if the first move to (4,1) is safe.\n\nFrom (4,1), I can go to (4,2) or (3,1).\n\nIf I go to (3,1), it might be a dead end or something.\n\n(3,1) is at bottom-left.\n\nThen from there, I can go up to (3,2) or right to (4,1) but occupied.\n\nBut (3,1) has only up and right, but right is to (4,1), which might be body.\n\nBut in the plan, I go up to (4,2).\n\nNow, another thing: the tail reward danger.\n\nBut in this case, no food under tail, so probably fine.\n\nNow, what if at turn 22 I move up to (5,2)?\n\nThen turn 23 must move left to (4,2)\n\nThen at turn 24, from (4,2), I can move to (4,3), same as before.\n\nAfter moving to (4,2) at turn 23, positions: as earlier, (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nThen move U to (4,3) at turn 24: new head (4,3), seg1 (4,2), seg2 (5,2), seg3 (5,1), seg4 (6,1), seg5 (6,2), seg6 (6,3), and (5,3) gone.\n\nThen move U to (4,4) at turn 25: head (4,4), seg1 (4,3), seg2 (4,2), seg3 (5,2), seg4 (5,1), seg5 (6,1), seg6 (6,2), (6,3) gone.\n\nThen move L to (3,4) at turn 26 to eat, same as before.\n\nSo in both cases, I can reach (3,4) by turn 26.\n\nBut in the first path (L then U U U L), the body is more to the left, while in the second (U L U U L), the body is more to the right.\n\nBut since I'm going to (3,4), it might not matter.\n\nHowever, in the second path, when I move to (4,2) at turn 23, in the U L path, I have (5,2) occupied, which is not in the L U path.\n\nBut for future moves, after eating at (3,4), I might want to go to (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is at (5,6), which is top.\n\nFrom (3,4), I need to go right and up.\n\nBut there might be obstacles.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (4,6) blocks the way.\n\nTo reach (5,6), I need to go to (5,5) first or (6,6).\n\nCurrently, after eating at (3,4), the snake is around (3,4) to (6,2) or something.\n\nIn the first plan (L U U U L), after eating: positions at turn 26: head (3,4), body (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nSo the snake occupies rows y=1 to y=4, x from 3 to 6, but not all cells.\n\n(5,5) and (5,6) are free.\n\nTo go to (5,6), I can go right to (4,4) but occupied, or up from (3,4) to (3,5), etc.\n\nFrom (3,4), possible moves: U to (3,5), D to (3,3) but (3,3) might be free, L to (2,4), R to (4,4) occupied by body.\n\nR to (4,4) is seg1, occupied, so cannot.\n\nAlso, direction: I moved left to (3,4), so direction L.\n\nCannot move right immediately, reverse not allowed.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (3,5), D to (3,3), L to (2,4).\n\n(3,5) and (2,4) should be free.\n\nThen I can go to (3,5), then to (4,5), etc., to reach (5,6).\n\nBut (4,6) is obstacle, so I need to go to (5,5) or (6,6).\n\n(5,5) is at x=5,y=5.\n\nFrom (3,4), if I go to (3,5), then to (4,5), then to (5,5), then to (5,6).\n\n(4,5) to (5,5) is right, then (5,5) to (5,6) up.\n\nNow, are these cells free? Currently yes, but need to check if occupied later.\n\nSimilarly, in the other path, similar.\n\nBut in the U L path for initial, it might be different.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (5,6) has life span 7, so after turn 22, it will be available for 7 turns, until turn 28? Life span 7 at turn 22, after turn 22:6, 23:5, ..., after turn 28:0, so can be eaten on turns 22 to 28.\n\nTurn 28 is the last chance.\n\nIf I eat at turn 26 at (3,4), then I have turns 27 and 28 to reach (5,6), but from (3,4) to (5,6) is |3-5| + |4-6| = 2+2=4 min moves, but with the snake body, it might be tight.\n\nFrom (3,4) to (5,6): possible path: (3,4) to (4,4) but occupied, so need to go around.\n\nFor example, from (3,4) go U to (3,5), then R to (4,5), then R to (5,5), then U to (5,6).\n\nThat's 4 moves: turn 27 to (3,5), turn 28 to (4,5), turn 29 to (5,5), turn 30 to (5,6). But turn 30 is too late for (5,6), since it disappears after turn 28? At turn 28, life span? At turn 22, life span 7, after turn 22:6, after 23:5, after 24:4, after 25:3, after 26:2, after 27:1, after 28:0 disappears, so on turn 28, if I move to it, I can eat it before it disappears.\n\nLife span: at start of turn, if life span L, after turn it decreases.\n\nIf I move to food cell on turn t, I eat it, and it is consumed.\n\nIf life span is 1 at start of turn, after I eat it, it disappears anyway.\n\nSo for (5,6), life span 7 at turn 22, at turn 28: after 6 turns, life span should be 1? Turn 22: L=7, after turn 22: L=6; start turn 23: L=6, after turn 23: L=5; ... start turn 28: L=1, after I eat it during turn, it is gone, so I can eat on turn 28.\n\nTurn 29 it would be gone.\n\nSimilarly, I need to be at (5,6) on turn 28 at latest.\n\nIn the plan, I eat (3,4) on turn 26, then on turn 27 I can be at (3,5) or (4,5), etc.\n\nBut to reach (5,6) by turn 28, from (3,4) after turn 26, I need to be there in 2 moves: turn 27 and 28.\n\nBut |dx| + |dy| = 2+2=4, min 4 moves, impossible in 2 moves. So I cannot reach (5,6) from (3,4) in 2 moves.\n\nTherefore, if I go to (3,4) first, I might miss (5,6) if I don't have time.\n\nBut (5,6) life span longer, I could go to (5,6) first.\n\nPerhaps I should go for (5,6) directly from the start.\n\nBut from (5,1), how to go up?\n\nIf I go up to (5,2), then I must go left to (4,2), then from there I can go up.\n\nBut to reach (5,6), I need to go to y=6.\n\nFrom (4,2), go U to (4,3), then U to (4,4), then U to (4,5), but (4,5) is free, then from (4,5) I can go R to (5,5), then U to (5,6).\n\nBut (4,6) is obstacle, so (4,5) to (5,5) to (5,6).\n\nOr from (4,5) I could go U but (4,6) blocked, so must go right to (5,5).\n\nNow, let's see the turns.\n\nStart at turn 22: move U to (5,2)\n\nTurn 23: move L to (4,2)\n\nTurn 24: move U to (4,3)\n\nTurn 25: move U to (4,4)\n\nTurn 26: move U to (4,5)\n\nTurn 27: move R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 28: move U to (5,6) and eat.\n\nYes, and (5,6) can be eaten on turn 28.\n\nLife span at turn 22:7, after 22:6, 23:5, 24:4, 25:3, 26:2, 27:1, 28:0? Start turn 28: L=1, after eat, it disappears.\n\nSo on turn 28, I can eat it.\n\nSimilarly, I can eat (5,6) by turn 28.\n\nBut what about (3,4)? It has life span 10, so after turn 28, it will still be there for a while.\n\nAfter eating (5,6), I can go to (3,4).\n\nBut let's see the position after turn 28.\n\nAfter eating (5,6) at turn 28, head at (5,6), and snake grows, so positions: from before move to (5,6): at turn 27, after moving to (5,5), positions: let's track.\n\nTurn 26: after move to (4,5), positions: head (4,5), seg1 (4,4), seg2 (4,3), seg3 (4,2), seg4 (5,2)? Earlier positions.\n\nFrom turn 25: after move U to (4,4) at turn 25? Let's start from turn 24.\n\nAt turn 24: after move U to (4,3) from (4,2)\n\nPositions: head (4,3), seg1 (4,2), seg2 (5,2), seg3 (5,1), seg4 (6,1), seg5 (6,2), seg6 (6,3), and (5,3) gone.\n\nThen turn 25: move U to (4,4) — (4,4) free, move to (4,4): head (4,4), seg1 (4,3), seg2 (4,2), seg3 (5,2), seg4 (5,1), seg5 (6,1), seg6 (6,2), (6,3) gone.\n\nThen turn 26: move U to (4,5) — (4,5) free, move to (4,5): head (4,5), seg1 (4,4), seg2 (4,3), seg3 (4,2), seg4 (5,2), seg5 (5,1), seg6 (6,1), (6,2) gone.\n\nThen turn 27: move R to (5,5) — (5,5) free, move to (5,5): head (5,5), seg1 (4,5), seg2 (4,4), seg3 (4,3), seg4 (4,2), seg5 (5,2), seg6 (5,1), (6,1) gone.\n\nThen turn 28: move U to (5,6) and eat: head to (5,6), since eat, tail doesn't move, so new head (5,6), seg1 (5,5), seg2 (4,5), seg3 (4,4), seg4 (4,3), seg5 (4,2), seg6 (5,2), seg7 (5,1).\n\nSnake longer.\n\nNow, from here, I can go to (3,4), but (3,4) is at (3,4), which is left and down.\n\nHead at (5,6), direction U (since moved up).\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,7) but y=7 wall, invalid; D to (5,5) occupied; L to (4,6) but (4,6) obstacle, invalid; R to (6,6).\n\nSo only possible move is R to (6,6).\n\nThen from (6,6), I can go D to (6,5) or L to (5,6) occupied, etc.\n\nBut to reach (3,4), it might take many moves, and (3,4) life span 10, at turn 22, after 6 turns (to turn 28), life span 10-6=4, so at turn 28, life span 4, can be eaten until turn 31.\n\nAfter turn 28, I am at (6,6), I need to go to (3,4), which is min |6-3| + |6-4| =3+2=5 moves, so by turn 33, but life span: at turn 28, L=4, after 28:3, 29:2, 30:1, 31:0 disappears, so can be eaten on turns 28,29,30,31.\n\nI need to be at (3,4) by turn 31.\n\nFrom (6,6) at turn 28 after eating, I move to (6,6) at turn 28? Turn 28 I ate at (5,6), so after that, head at (5,6), and I move to (6,6) on next turn.\n\nTurn 29: move to (6,6)\n\nThen from (6,6), possible moves: U to (6,7) wall; D to (6,5); L to (5,6) occupied; R to (7,6) x=7 wall. So only D to (6,5).\n\nTurn 29: move D to (6,5)\n\nThen turn 30: from (6,5), I can go D to (6,4), or L to (5,5), or U to (6,6) occupied, or R to (7,5) wall.\n\n(5,5) might be occupied? Positions: after turn 29 move to (6,5): head (6,5), seg1 (6,6)? Let's track positions.\n\nAfter turn 28 eat at (5,6): positions head (5,6), body: (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1)\n\nThen turn 29: move R to (6,6) — but (6,6) is not occupied, free. Move to (6,6): new head (6,6), seg1 (5,6), seg2 (5,5), seg3 (4,5), seg4 (4,4), seg5 (4,3), seg6 (4,2), seg7 (5,2), and (5,1) gone? Tail was (5,1), so gone.\n\nPositions: (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2)\n\n(5,1) free.\n\nFrom (6,6), move to (6,5) at turn 30? Turn 29 I moved to (6,6), so for turn 30.\n\nTurn 30: move from (6,6) to (6,5) — D to (6,5)\n\nNew head (6,5), seg1 (6,6), seg2 (5,6), seg3 (5,5), seg4 (4,5), seg5 (4,4), seg6 (4,3), seg7 (4,2), and (5,2) gone.\n\nPositions: (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2)\n\nNow from (6,5), I can go D to (6,4), L to (5,5), or U to (6,6) occupied, R wall.\n\n(5,5) is occupied by seg4, so collision if I go L.\n\n(6,4) might be free.\n\nGo D to (6,4).\n\nBut (6,4) is free? Not in positions.\n\nThen turn 31: to (6,4), etc.\n\nBut I need to go to (3,4), which is far.\n\nFrom (6,5), if I go L to (5,5), but (5,5) is occupied, so I cannot, only D to (6,4) or other, but U and R invalid.\n\nSo must go D to (6,4).\n\nThen turn 31: at (6,4), go L to (5,4) or D to (6,3), etc.\n\nBut (3,4) is at x=3,y=4, I'm at x=6,y=4, so I can go left.\n\nBut it will take several turns, and life span of (3,4) is decreasing.\n\nAt turn 30, positions include (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), so (3,4) is not occupied yet.\n\nBut to reach (3,4) from (6,4) at turn 31, I need to go to (5,4), (4,4), but (4,4) is occupied, so I have to go around, like to (5,3) or something.\n\nIt might be messy, and I might not reach in time.\n\nAt turn 30, from (6,5), I go to (6,4), then turn 31 to (6,3) or (5,4), etc.\n\n(5,4) might be free.\n\nAssume I go to (5,4) at some point.\n\nBut (4,4) is occupied until the snake moves.\n\nThis seems inefficient, and I might not get to (3,4) before it disappears.\n\nTherefore, it might be better to go for (3,4) first, since it's closer, and then see about (5,6) later, but as we saw, from (3,4) I can't reach (5,6) in time for its life span.\n\n(5,6) life span until turn 28, and from (3,4) at turn 26, I can't reach by turn 28.\n\nSo if I go to (3,4) first, I miss (5,6).\n\nIf I go to (5,6) first, I might miss (3,4) or have difficulty.\n\nBut (3,4) has longer life span, so I could go to (5,6) first, then to (3,4) if possible.\n\nBut as above, from the position after eating (5,6), it's hard to reach (3,4) quickly.\n\nPerhaps there is a better initial move.\n\nAnother idea: from (5,1), instead of moving up or left, I have no choice, only U or L.\n\nBut if I move L to (4,1), then at turn 23, instead of going U, I could go L to (3,1), but that might not help.\n\nFor example, turn 22: L to (4,1)\n\nTurn 23: L to (3,1)\n\nThen positions: head (3,1), body (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nThen from (3,1), I can go U to (3,2) or R to (4,1) occupied.\n\nGo U to (3,2)\n\nThen to (3,3), then to (3,4) to eat.\n\nTurn 24: U to (3,2)\n\nTurn 25: U to (3,3)\n\nTurn 26: U to (3,4) eat.\n\nSame as before, but I reach (3,4) at turn 26.\n\nThen same issue with (5,6).\n\nBut in this case, when I eat at (3,4), the snake is at (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) or something, so more left, but (5,6) is still far.\n\nSo I think I should go for (5,6) first, as it has shorter life span, and (3,4) can be gotten later if possible.\n\nBut from the position after (5,6), it's top-right, and (3,4) is bottom-left, hard to reach.\n\nPerhaps I can go directly to (5,6) from current position with a different path.\n\nFrom (5,1), move U to (5,2), then L to (4,2), then U to (4,3), U to (4,4), U to (4,5), R to (5,5), U to (5,6), as before, 6 moves to eat at turn 28.\n\nThen for (3,4), with life span 10, at turn 28, life span 10-6=4, so I have until turn 31 to eat.\n\nFrom (5,6) after eating, I am at (5,6), and I can only go to (6,6) as before, then to (6,5), etc.\n\nFrom (6,5), I can go down to (6,4), then to (6,3), but (6,3) might be occupied or not.\n\nIn positions after eating (5,6), we have (5,5), (4,5), etc down to (4,2), (5,2), so (6,3), (6,4) are free.\n\nSo from (6,5), go D to (6,4) at turn 30, then to (6,3) at turn 31, then to (5,3) or (6,2), but to reach (3,4), I need to go left.\n\nAt (6,3), I can go L to (5,3), but (5,3) might be occupied? In the positions, at turn 28, we have (4,3) occupied, but (5,3) is free? After eating at (5,6), positions: (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,1) — so (5,3) is free.\n\nSo from (6,3), go L to (5,3) at turn 32, then to (5,4) or (4,3), but (4,3) is occupied.\n\n(4,3) is seg5 or something, occupied.\n\nGo to (5,4) at turn 33, then to (5,5) but occupied, or to (4,4) occupied, or to (6,4) but that's back.\n\nFrom (5,3), I can go U to (5,4), then from (5,4) go L to (4,4) but occupied, or U to (5,5) occupied, or R to (6,4), or D to (5,2) occupied.\n\nStuck.\n\nFrom (5,3) go D to (5,2) but occupied.\n\nSo it's difficult to reach (3,4) from there.\n\nTherefore, perhaps it's better to go for (3,4) first, and forget about (5,6), since I can eat (3,4) for sure, and (5,6) is risky to get and I might not get both.\n\nBut (5,6) is closer in terms of the board, but with the body, it takes more moves.\n\nAnother thought: at turn 22, move L to (4,1), then at turn 23, move U to (4,2), then at turn 24, instead of going to (4,3), I can go to (3,2) or something to head towards (5,6)? But (5,6) is up.\n\nFrom (4,2), if I go to (3,2), then to (3,3), etc, not towards (5,6).\n\nSo not better.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid the area where the body is.\n\nThe body is mostly on the right, so moving left to (4,1) might open up space.\n\nBut let's consider survival first.\n\nIn the move to (5,2), then (4,2), I am forced into a position where I have fewer choices initially.\n\nWhereas moving to (4,1) first, I have more choices at turn 23.\n\nBut both lead to similar paths.\n\nThe food at (1,6) is impossible to reach, so ignore.\n\nSo I think the best is to go for (3,4) first, as it's achievable and safe.\n\nThen after eating, I can explore for other food or just survive.\n\nBut there might be more food spawning, but the state only has these three, so assume no new food for now.\n\nThe state doesn't say new food spawns, so only these three.\n\nSo with that, I should eat (3,4).\n\nAt turn 22, move L to (4,1)\n\nThen sequence: turn 23 U to (4,2), turn 24 U to (4,3), turn 25 U to (4,4), turn 26 L to (3,4) eat.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nFrom turn 22 to turn 26, that's 5 actions.\n\nTurn 22,23,24,25,26.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd it maximizes score by eating one food.\n\nIf I go for (5,6), I eat one food at turn 28, but I might not eat (3,4), so same score, but (5,6) is later and riskier with the obstacle.\n\nWhereas (3,4) is safer and sooner.\n\nAlso, in the (5,6) path, when I go to (4,5), etc, it might be tight, but no immediate risk.\n\nBut I think both are possible, but (3,4) is better.\n\nMoreover, in the initial position, if I move U to (5,2), I am forced to move L to (4,2) next, which is fine, but moving L directly to (4,1) gives more flexibility.\n\nFor example, from (4,1), I can go to (3,1) or (4,2), but going to (3,1) might not be better.\n\nBut in this case, for (3,4), going via (4,2) is fine.\n\nSo I think move L at turn 22.\n\nThen the sequence:\n\nTurn 22: L to (4,1)\n\nTurn 23: U to (4,2)\n\nTurn 24: U to (4,3)\n\nTurn 25: U to (4,4)\n\nTurn 26: L to (3,4) eat\n\nBut at turn 25, I am at (4,4), and move L to (3,4) at turn 26.\n\nIs there any issue with the tail or something?\n\nAt turn 25, positions before move: head at (4,4), body (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nThen move to (3,4), eat, so new head (3,4), body (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) with tail staying.\n\nAll fine.\n\nThen after that, I can move to (3,5) or (2,4) or (3,3), etc.\n\nBut for the plan, I need to output 5 turns, from 22 to 26.\n\nThe answer should be for turns 22,23,24,25,26.\n\nSince turn 26 is included, and I eat at turn 26.\n\nSimilarly, if I start with U, I can have a sequence to (4,4) by turn 25, but to eat (3,4) at turn 26 same.\n\nBut with U start, at turn 25 I am at (4,4), same as with L start.\n\nIn both cases, at turn 25 I can be at (4,4) to move to (3,4) at 26.\n\nWith L start: turn 22 L to (4,1), 23 U to (4,2), 24 U to (4,3), 25 U to (4,4), 26 L to (3,4)\n\nWith U start: turn 22 U to (5,2), 23 L to (4,2), 24 U to (4,3), 25 U to (4,4), 26 L to (3,4)\n\nSame from turn 24 onwards.\n\nOnly the first two moves differ.\n\nBut in terms of the body, with L start, when at (4,4), the body includes (4,1), (5,1), etc, while with U start, body includes (5,2), (5,1), etc.\n\nBut for future, it might not matter much.\n\nI think either is fine, but since moving L directly might be more straightforward, I'll go with that.\n\nAlso, moving L at turn 22 avoids the forced move to (4,2) immediately.\n\nSo I'll choose to move L at turn 22.\n\nThen the actions:\n\nTurn 22: L\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: L\n\nBut I need to output for at least 5 turns, so this is fine.\n\nTo be precise, let's write the answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I will plan a sequence of moves for at least 5 turns ahead (turns 22 to 26). The goal is to safely eat the positive food at (3,4) by turn 26, as it has a long life span (10 turns remaining at turn 22) and is reachable without significant risk. The food at (1,6) is too far to reach before it disappears (life span 4, min distance 9 moves), and the food at (5,6) is considered but requires a longer path with potential risks due to the internal obstacle at (4,6) and the snake's body position. Eating (3,4) first ensures a guaranteed +1 score with minimal risk.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Current Position and Constraints**: The snake head is at (5,1) with direction left. From (5,1), moving down is invalid (wall at y=0), and moving right is invalid (body collision and reverse move). Only up (U) or left (L) are possible at turn 22.\n- **Food Prioritization**: \n  - (3,4) is prioritized due to proximity (Manhattan distance 3 from (4,1)) and long life span. It can be safely eaten by turn 26.\n  - (5,6) is not targeted in this sequence because reaching it from (3,4) after turn 26 is unlikely within its life span (ends at turn 28), and the path involves navigating near the obstacle at (4,6) and the body.\n- **Survival Focus**: The chosen path avoids body collisions and walls, and the sequence ensures the snake has multiple escape routes after eating. Moving left at turn 22 provides more flexibility than moving up (which forces an immediate left turn at turn 23).\n- **Path to (3,4)**:\n  - Turn 22: Move left to (4,1) – opens space and heads toward (3,4).\n  - Turn 23: Move up to (4,2) – continues toward (3,4) with no body or wall issues.\n  - Turn 24: Move up to (4,3) – positions for direct approach to (3,4).\n  - Turn 25: Move up to (4,4) – adjacent to food at (3,4).\n  - Turn 26: Move left to (3,4) – eat food (score +1, length increases to 8).\n- **Risk Avoidance**: This path avoids:\n  - Body collisions: All moves are to empty cells.\n  - Walls: All moves stay within bounds (x=1-6, y=1-6).\n  - Tail reward danger: No food under the tail in this sequence.\n  - Dead ends: After eating, the snake can move up, down, or left from (3,4) for further exploration.\n\n### Planned Move Sequence (Turns 22-26):\n- Turn 22: Move left (L) to (4,1). *Rationale: Only safe options are L or U; L avoids the forced left turn that would occur after U and provides better access to (3,4).*\n- Turn 23: Move up (U) to (4,2). *Rationale: Continues path to (3,4); only U or L possible from (4,1), and U is chosen to ascend.*\n- Turn 24: Move up (U) to (4,3). *Rationale: Advances toward (3,4) with no obstacles.*\n- Turn 25: Move up (U) to (4,4). *Rationale: Positions adjacent to food at (3,4); all moves safe.*\n- Turn 26: Move left (L) to (3,4) and eat the food. *Rationale: Eats (3,4) for +1 score; no collision risk.*\n\n### Future Outlook (Beyond Turn 26):\n- After eating at (3,4), the snake can consider the remaining food at (5,6) (if life span allows) or new food spawns. From (3,4), possible moves include up to (3,5), down to (3,3), or left to (2,4), all likely safe given the body positions.\n- This sequence scores at least +1 and sets up for further survival. If (5,6) is still available after turn 26, a path via (3,5) → (4,5) → (5,5) → (5,6) could be attempted, but it is not included here due to life span constraints.\n\nThis plan maximizes immediate score potential while ensuring long-term survival through safe, deterministic moves.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 22: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 23: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 24: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 25: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 26: L (left)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. The current turn is 23.\n\nWalls: The borders are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So, the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (4,6). So, I can't move into walls or obstacles.\n\nSnake positions: The snake is at [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)]. Let's list these out:\n\n- Head: (4,1)\n\n- Then (5,1)\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (6,2)\n\n- (6,3)\n\n- (5,3)\n\n- Tail: (5,4)\n\nThe head is at (4,1) and the direction is L, which is left. So, it was moving left to get to (4,1) from (5,1).\n\nCurrent head direction is L, meaning it just moved left to (4,1).\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (1,6) with life span 3 and value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (5,6) with life span 6 and value 1 (positive)\n\n- (3,4) with life span 9 and value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, value 1, so eating any gives +1 score and increases length by 1.\n\nLife span: For (1,6), life span 3 means it disappears after 3 more turns, including the current turn. Since current turn is 23, it will disappear after turn 25? Let's clarify.\n\nThe life span decreases every turn, including current. So for (1,6) with life span 3 at turn 23:\n\n- After turn 23, life span becomes 2\n\n- After turn 24, life span becomes 1\n\n- After turn 25, life span becomes 0, so it disappears. So it can be eaten up to turn 25, but not on turn 26.\n\nSimilarly for others:\n\n(5,6): life span 6, disappears after turn 28 (23+6-1? Wait no.\n\nAt turn 23, life span N, it disappears after N turns from now. So:\n\n- (1,6): life span 3, disappears after turn 25 (since after turn 23, span=2; after 24, span=1; after 25, span=0 gone)\n\nGeneral: if life span is N at turn T, it exists from T to T+N-1 inclusive? Let's see.\n\nThe problem says: \"disappears after N turns (including current)\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo at turn T, with life span N, after turn T, it decreases to N-1. When life span reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nSo for (1,6) at turn 23, life span 3:\n\n- Turn 23: life span 3 (can be eaten)\n\n- Turn 24: life span 2 (can be eaten)\n\n- Turn 25: life span 1 (can be eaten)\n\n- Turn 26: life span 0, gone\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) life span 6:\n\n- Turn 23 to 28: present (span 6 to 1)\n\n- Turn 29: gone\n\n(3,4) life span 9:\n\n- Turn 23 to 31: present\n\n- Turn 32: gone\n\nNow, snake head is at (4,1), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U (up), D (down), L (left), R (right).\n\nBut no instant reverse: current direction is L, so cannot move R (right) immediately, because that would be opposite to L.\n\nL is left, so opposite is R, right. So cannot move right on this turn.\n\nAlso, need to avoid walls and body collisions.\n\nGrid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake body: positions [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)]\n\nHead at (4,1), so adjacent cells:\n\n- Up: (4,2)\n\n- Down: (4,0) but y=0 is wall, so down is invalid\n\n- Left: (3,1)\n\n- Right: (5,1) but (5,1) is the first body segment, so moving right would collide with body.\n\nBody collision: head touches any body segment except the tail, because when moving, the tail moves away.\n\nBut here, (5,1) is not the tail; tail is at (5,4).\n\nLet's see the snake positions:\n\nIndex 0: head (4,1)\n\nIndex 1: (5,1)\n\nIndex 2: (6,1)\n\nIndex 3: (6,2)\n\nIndex 4: (6,3)\n\nIndex 5: (5,3)\n\nIndex 6: tail (5,4)\n\nSo if head moves to (5,1), which is occupied by body segment at index 1, not the tail, so it's a collision, death.\n\nSimilarly, moving down to (4,0) is wall, death.\n\nMoving left to (3,1): is this free?\n\n(3,1) not in snake positions? Snake is at (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4). (3,1) is not listed, so should be free, but need to check walls.\n\nx=3, y=1, x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7, not border or obstacle, so free.\n\nMoving up to (4,2): not in snake positions? (4,2) not listed, and not wall, so should be free.\n\nBut (4,2) might be near something.\n\nFirst, possible moves from (4,1):\n\n- U: (4,2) - no wall, no body? Snake positions: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4). (4,2) not in list, so free.\n\n- D: (4,0) - y=0 wall, invalid\n\n- L: (3,1) - free\n\n- R: (5,1) - occupied by body segment index 1, not tail, so collision.\n\nAlso, cannot move R because it's opposite to current direction L? Current direction is L, so moving R is reverse, not allowed.\n\nThe rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nCurrent head direction is L, so cannot move R (right) on this turn.\n\nTherefore, possible actions: U, D, L.\n\nBut D is invalid (wall), so only U or L.\n\nU: (4,2) or L: (3,1)\n\nNow, I need to think multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score and survive.\n\nFood available:\n\n(1,6), (5,6), (3,4)\n\nAll positive.\n\n(3,4) is at (3,4), which might be reachable.\n\nFirst, let's see the current position.\n\nSnake head at (4,1). Food at (3,4), which is left and up from here.\n\n(4,1) to (3,4): delta x = -1, delta y = +3, so not adjacent.\n\n(5,6) is at (5,6), which is right and up, but x=5,y=6.\n\n(1,6) is far, x=1,y=6.\n\nLife spans: (1,6) has short life, only 3 turns including current, so must be eaten by turn 25.\n\n(5,6) has life span 6, so until turn 28.\n\n(3,4) has life span 9, plenty of time.\n\nBut I need to eat while avoiding risks.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nFirst, let's find where the tail is.\n\nTail at (5,4). Is there food on tail? Food positions: (1,6), (5,6), (3,4). None at (5,4), so no issue now.\n\nBut if I move and food spawns or something, but food is given, no new food mentioned, so only these three.\n\nThe problem doesn't say if new food appears, but in this state, only these are given, so probably these are the only food for now.\n\nI should plan a path to eat food.\n\nFirst, from (4,1), I can go U to (4,2) or L to (3,1).\n\nIf I go L to (3,1), then I'm closer to (3,4), but (3,4) is at y=4, I'm at y=1.\n\nIf I go U to (4,2), I'm going up.\n\nAlso, need to think about the snake body.\n\nThe snake is currently in a sort of U shape: from (4,1) to (5,1) to (6,1) to (6,2) to (6,3) to (5,3) to (5,4). So it's like a box or something.\n\nLet me sketch the grid:\n\ny=7: border\n\ny=6: food at (1,6) and (5,6), obstacle at (4,6)? Walls: internal obstacle at (4,6), so (4,6) is wall.\n\ny=5: free?\n\ny=4: food at (3,4)\n\ny=3: snake at (6,3), (5,3)\n\ny=2: snake at (6,2)\n\ny=1: snake at (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\ny=0: border wall\n\nx from 0 to 7.\n\nAt x=4,y=6: obstacle.\n\nNow, snake head at (4,1).\n\nIf I move U to (4,2), what happens?\n\nAfter moving, the snake moves: head to (4,2), then body follows: the segment that was at (4,1) moves to where head was? No.\n\nWhen snake moves, head goes to new position, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it.\n\nSo positions: current: index 0: (4,1), index 1: (5,1), index 2: (6,1), index 3: (6,2), index 4: (6,3), index 5: (5,3), index 6: (5,4)\n\nIf head moves to (4,2), then:\n\n- New head: (4,2)\n\n- Body: index 0 was (4,1), so now index 1 moves to (4,1)\n\nIndex 1 was (5,1), so it moves to where index 0 was, (4,1)\n\nThen index 2 was (6,1), moves to where index 1 was, (5,1)\n\nIndex 3 was (6,2), moves to where index 2 was, (6,1)\n\nIndex 4 was (6,3), moves to where index 3 was, (6,2)\n\nIndex 5 was (5,3), moves to where index 4 was, (6,3)\n\nIndex 6 tail was (5,4), moves to where index 5 was, (5,3)\n\nSo new positions: head (4,2), then (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nTail at (5,3)\n\nNow, (5,4) is free now, since tail moved away.\n\nBut no food there.\n\nIf I move L to (3,1), then:\n\nHead to (3,1)\n\nBody: index 1 to (4,1) (where head was)\n\nIndex 2 to (5,1) (where index 1 was)\n\nIndex 3 to (6,1) (where index 2 was)\n\nIndex 4 to (6,2) (where index 3 was)\n\nIndex 5 to (6,3) (where index 4 was)\n\nIndex 6 to (5,3) (where index 5 was)\n\nSo positions: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nTail at (5,3)\n\nNow, (5,4) is free.\n\nAgain, no food.\n\nNow, I need to get to food.\n\nFirst, the food at (3,4) is close, at (3,4), and I'm at (4,1) or if I move left, at (3,1).\n\nFrom (3,1), I can go up to (3,2), then (3,3), then (3,4) to eat.\n\nBut (3,4) has food, so if I go to (3,4) when head is there, I eat it.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) at (5,6), but there's an obstacle at (4,6), so I need to go around.\n\n(1,6) is far, and life span short.\n\nSince (1,6) has only 3 turns life, I should consider if I can reach it.\n\nFrom (4,1) to (1,6): need to move left and up.\n\nBut y from 1 to 6, x from 4 to 1.\n\nMinimum moves: |dx| + |dy| = 3 + 5 = 8 moves, but with snake body, it might take more if path is blocked.\n\nBut with life span 3, I can reach at turn 23,24,25.\n\nAt turn 23, I move, then turn 24, turn 25.\n\nIf I start from (4,1), to (1,6), it takes at least 5 moves up and 3 left, so 8 moves, but I can do in less? No, Manhattan distance is |4-1| + |1-6| = 3 + 5 = 8 cells, so at least 8 turns to reach, but at turn 23, I can move, so after 8 moves, I reach at turn 23 + 8 = 31, which is way after life span 3. Life span 3 means it disappears after turn 25, so I can only reach by turn 25 at latest.\n\nTurn 23: I move first time\n\nAfter 1 move: turn 24\n\nAfter 2 moves: turn 25\n\nAfter 3 moves: turn 26, but at turn 26, food is gone.\n\nSo I need to reach (1,6) by turn 25, meaning I need to be there on or before turn 25.\n\nAt turn 23, I am at (4,1). After one move on turn 23, I am at new position on turn 24.\n\nLet's clarify the turn timing.\n\nAt turn T, I choose action, move, then the state updates for turn T+1.\n\nSo at the start of turn 23, I am at positions, I choose move, after move, it is turn 24.\n\nThe food life span decreases after each turn, including after the move.\n\nThe problem: \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nI think it means at the end of the turn or beginning?\n\nLet's read: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nAnd \"can be eaten if head moves onto the food cell on that turn.\"\n\nSo, at turn T, with life span N, if head moves to food, it is eaten, and life span decreases after that? Or before?\n\nTypically in such games, at turn T, if head is on food, it is eaten, then life span decreases.\n\nBut the countdown decreases every turn, including when it is eaten or not.\n\nAssume that at the start of turn T, food has life span S.\n\nThen, during turn T, if head moves to food, it is eaten, and the food is removed.\n\nIf not eaten, at the end of turn T, life span decreases to S-1.\n\nIf S-1 >0, it remains, else disappears.\n\nFor (1,6) at turn 23, life span 3.\n\nTurn 23: life span 3, can be eaten on turn 23.\n\nIf not eaten, after turn 23, life span becomes 2 for turn 24.\n\nTurn 24: life span 2, can be eaten.\n\nIf not eaten, after turn 24, life span 1 for turn 25.\n\nTurn 25: life span 1, can be eaten.\n\nAfter turn 25, if not eaten, life span 0, disappears, not available on turn 26.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFor (1,6), to eat it, I must be on (1,6) on turn 23, 24, or 25.\n\nBut at turn 23, I am at (4,1), so impossible to be at (1,6) on turn 23 since I just move from there.\n\nAt turn 23, I start at (4,1), I move to a new position, which is where I am at turn 24.\n\nAfter moving on turn 23, I am at the new head position for turn 24.\n\nThe turn increments after the move.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn 23, snake is at given positions.\n\nI choose action, move to new head position, and body follows, so now the snake is in new positions for the start of turn 24.\n\nSimilarly, food life span: at start of turn 23, life span as given.\n\nAfter the move, if head ate food, it is consumed.\n\nThen, for the next turn, life span decreases.\n\nThe problem says: \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" but it might be ambiguous.\n\nAssume standard: at each turn, after the move, life span decreases for the next turn.\n\nBut to be consistent with \"including current\", perhaps at turn T, before move, life span S, if head moves to food, eaten, food removed. If not, after move, life span decreases to S-1 for next turn.\n\nFor (1,6) at turn 23, life span 3.\n\n- On turn 23: if head moves to (1,6), eaten. If not, after turn 23, life span 2 for turn 24.\n\n- On turn 24: if head to (1,6), eaten. If not, life span 1 for turn 25.\n\n- On turn 25: if head to (1,6), eaten. If not, after turn 25, life span 0, gone for turn 26.\n\nSo I can eat it on turn 24 or 25, but not on 23 since I'm not there.\n\nBut from (4,1) to (1,6), Manhattan distance 3 in x, 5 in y, so min 8 moves.\n\nIn 2 moves (turn 23 and 24), I can move at most 2 cells, so from (4,1) after 2 moves, I can be at best, say, (2,3) or something, not (1,6).\n\nAfter turn 23 move: I move one step, say to (4,2) or (3,1), so at turn 24 start, I am at that position.\n\nThen on turn 24, I move again, to another position, at turn 25 start.\n\nSo to be at (1,6) on turn 24, I need to move directly to it on turn 23, but from (4,1) to (1,6) is not adjacent, impossible.\n\nTo be at (1,6) on turn 25, I need to reach it on turn 25 move.\n\nAt turn 24 start, I am at some position, say P.\n\nOn turn 24, I move from P to Q, and if Q is (1,6), I eat it on turn 24.\n\nFor turn 25, I need to be at (1,6) on turn 25 move.\n\nAt turn 24 start, I am at some cell, and I move to (1,6) on turn 24 action, so I eat on turn 24.\n\nSimilarly, to eat on turn 25, at turn 25 start I am at some cell adjacent to (1,6), and move to it on turn 25.\n\nBut from turn 23 start, I am at (4,1).\n\nAfter one move on turn 23, at turn 24 start, I am at one of: (4,2) or (3,1) (since only U or L possible, D and R invalid).\n\nFrom (4,2) or (3,1), to (1,6), it takes at least 4 or 5 moves? |dx| + |dy|.\n\nFrom (4,2) to (1,6): dx=3 left, dy=4 up, min 7 moves.\n\nFrom (3,1) to (1,6): dx=2 left, dy=5 up, min 7 moves.\n\nBut I have only from turn 24 to turn 25: on turn 24, I can move one step, so at best, from (3,1) I go to (2,1) or (3,2) or (4,1) but (4,1) may be occupied, etc.\n\nBut after one move on turn 24, I am at turn 25 start, still far from (1,6).\n\nFor example, from (3,1), after turn 24 move, I can be at (2,1), (3,2), or (3,0) invalid, or (4,1) which is body? But body moves, so depending.\n\nBut (2,1) to (1,6) is dx=1, dy=5, still min 6 moves away.\n\nSimilarly, from (4,2), to (1,6) dx=3, dy=4, min 7.\n\nSo impossible to reach (1,6) by turn 25. The earliest I can be at (1,6) is after several more turns, but food gone by turn 26.\n\nSo (1,6) cannot be eaten; it will disappear without being eaten. Ignore it.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) has life span 6, so can be eaten up to turn 28.\n\n(3,4) has life span 9, up to turn 31.\n\nNow, (3,4) is closer, at (3,4), I am at (4,1), so |dx|=1, |dy|=3, min 4 moves.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) at (5,6), |dx|=1, |dy=5| from (4,1), min 6 moves.\n\nBut (5,6) is near the obstacle at (4,6).\n\nNow, let's plan.\n\nFirst, at turn 23, from (4,1), I can go U or L.\n\nIf I go L to (3,1), I am closer to (3,4).\n\nFrom (3,1), I can then go U to (3,2), then U to (3,3), then U to (3,4) to eat on turn 26? Let's count turns.\n\nTurn 23: move from (4,1) to (3,1) (L)\n\nThen at turn 24 start, head at (3,1)\n\nTurn 24: move to (3,2) (U)\n\nTurn 25: move to (3,3) (U)\n\nTurn 26: move to (3,4) (U), eat food.\n\nBut at turn 26, (3,4) has life span: at turn 23, life span 9.\n\nAfter turn 23, if not eaten, life span decreases to 8 for turn 24.\n\nTurn 24: not eaten, life span 7 for turn 25.\n\nTurn 25: not eaten, life span 6 for turn 26.\n\nTurn 26: if move to (3,4), eat, so yes, can eat on turn 26.\n\nSimilarly, I can eat earlier if possible, but from (4,1), (3,4) is not adjacent, so no.\n\nNow, if I go U on turn 23 to (4,2).\n\nThen at turn 24 start, at (4,2)\n\nThen I need to go to (3,4). From (4,2) to (3,4): I can go L to (3,2), then U to (3,3), U to (3,4), so same as above, but from (4,2) to (3,4) in 3 moves: e.g., turn 24: U to (4,3)? From (4,2) to (4,3) U, then to (4,4) U, then to (3,4) L, but (4,4) to (3,4) is left.\n\nBut (3,4) is the target.\n\nPath from (4,2):\n\nTurn 24: move to (4,3) U\n\nTurn 25: move to (4,4) U\n\nTurn 26: move to (3,4) L, eat.\n\nOr shorter? From (4,2) to (3,2) L on turn 24, then to (3,3) U turn 25, to (3,4) U turn 26, same.\n\nOr directly? No, not adjacent.\n\nSo eating (3,4) on turn 26 in both cases.\n\nBut if I go L first to (3,1), then to (3,4) also on turn 26.\n\nNow, what about (5,6)? It has longer life.\n\nBut let's see the other food.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows, so it gets longer.\n\nNow, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills.\n\nBut currently, no food on tail.\n\nNow, let's think about the grid with obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), so I cannot go there.\n\nAlso, walls at borders.\n\nNow, from current position, if I go U to (4,2), then I can go up further.\n\nBut above, at y=3,4, there is snake body.\n\nCurrent positions: at y=3, (6,3) and (5,3), at y=4, (5,4) tail.\n\nIf I go to (4,2), then next I can go U to (4,3), but (4,3) is it free?\n\nCurrent snake positions: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (5,4)\n\n(4,3) not listed, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) free, etc.\n\nBut if I go to (4,3), then later to (4,4), then to (3,4) to eat.\n\n(3,4) has food.\n\nI can eat (5,6) later.\n\n(5,6) is at (5,6), which is near the obstacle.\n\nTo reach (5,6), I need to go to x=5,y=6.\n\nBut obstacle at (4,6), so I can go via (5,5) or (6,6), etc.\n\n(6,6) is x=6,y=6, which is not wall, but near border.\n\nx=6, y=6, x=7 is wall, but (6,6) is ok.\n\nBut currently, snake has segments at (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), so the right column is partially occupied.\n\nNow, back to turn 23 choice.\n\nOption 1: move L to (3,1)\n\nThen, from (3,1), I can go U to (3,2), then U to (3,3), then U to (3,4) to eat on turn 26.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows, so length increases by one.\n\nSimilarly, if I go U to (4,2), then to (4,3), to (4,4), to (3,4) to eat on turn 26.\n\nBut (4,4) to (3,4) is left.\n\nNow, which is safer or better?\n\nIf I go left first to (3,1), I am moving away from the right side where the snake body is.\n\nIf I go up to (4,2), I am still near.\n\nBut let's think about after eating (3,4).\n\nAfter eating (3,4) on turn 26, snake grows, so new tail is added, so positions will be longer.\n\nThen I can go to other food.\n\n(5,6) at (5,6), life span until turn 28, so I have time.\n\nAlso, there might be risks.\n\nAnother thing: the tail is moving.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (5,4).\n\nWhen I move, tail moves away.\n\nFor example, if I go L to (3,1) on turn 23:\n\nNew positions at turn 24: head (3,1), body (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) tail at (5,3)\n\n(5,4) is free now.\n\nThen turn 24: move U to (3,2)\n\nNew head (3,2), body (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), tail (5,3)? Let's list:\n\nAfter move: head to (3,2), then body segments move: index 1 to where head was (3,1), index 2 to where index 1 was (4,1), index 3 to (5,1), index 4 to (6,1), index 5 to (6,2), index 6 to (6,3)\n\nPrevious positions at turn 24 start: after turn 23 move, for turn 24: positions (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nIndex: 0:(3,1), 1:(4,1), 2:(5,1), 3:(6,1), 4:(6,2), 5:(6,3), 6:(5,3) tail\n\nTurn 24 move U to (3,2)\n\nHead to (3,2)\n\nThen body: index 1 moves to where head was (3,1)\n\nIndex 2 moves to where index 1 was (4,1)\n\nIndex 3 moves to where index 2 was (5,1)\n\nIndex 4 moves to where index 3 was (6,1)\n\nIndex 5 moves to where index 4 was (6,2)\n\nIndex 6 moves to where index 5 was (6,3)\n\nSo new positions: head (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nTail at (6,3)\n\n(5,3) is free now.\n\nThen turn 25: move U to (3,3)\n\nHead to (3,3)\n\nBody: index 1 to (3,2), index 2 to (3,1), index 3 to (4,1), index 4 to (5,1), index 5 to (6,1), index 6 to (6,2)\n\nNew positions: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nTail at (6,2)\n\nThen turn 26: move U to (3,4), and eat food.\n\nSince (3,4) has food, eating it, so snake grows: after moving to (3,4), the tail doesn't move, so new segment added at the tail position before move or after?\n\nStandard snake: when eat, head moves to food, body follows, but tail stays, so length increases by one.\n\nSo positions: head to (3,4), then body moves to previous positions: index 1 to where head was (3,3), index 2 to where index 1 was (3,2), etc., down to index 6 to where index 5 was (6,1), and a new segment added at the previous tail position (6,2).\n\nAfter turn 25, positions: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nTail is (6,2)\n\nTurn 26: move to (3,4)\n\nHead to (3,4) (eats food)\n\nBody: segment that was index 1 ( (3,2) ) moves to where head was (3,3)\n\nSegment index 2 ( (3,1) ) moves to where index 1 was (3,2)\n\nIndex 3 ( (4,1) ) to where index 2 was (3,1)\n\nIndex 4 ( (5,1) ) to where index 3 was (4,1)\n\nIndex 5 ( (6,1) ) to where index 4 was (5,1)\n\nIndex 6 ( (6,2) ) to where index 5 was (6,1)\n\nAnd since ate food, a new segment is added at the previous tail position, which was (6,2), so new tail at (6,2)\n\nSo positions: head (3,4), then (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nNow length 8.\n\nSimilarly, if I had gone up first.\n\nBut in this path, I ate (3,4) on turn 26.\n\nNow, I can consider going to (5,6) after that.\n\n(5,6) at (5,6), from (3,4) to (5,6): dx=2 right, dy=2 up, min 4 moves.\n\nBut obstacle at (4,6), so I need to go around, e.g., via (4,4) or (5,5), etc.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can go R to (4,4), then U to (4,5), then? (4,5) to (4,6) but (4,6) is obstacle, cannot.\n\nSo need to go to (5,5) first or something.\n\nFrom (3,4) to (4,4) R, then to (5,4) R, but (5,4) may be occupied? In current state after eating, at turn 26, positions include (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), but (5,4) might be free.\n\nIn the positions above, after eating at (3,4), positions are (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nSo (5,4) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) free, (5,5) free, etc.\n\nSo from (3,4), I can go R to (4,4), then R to (5,4), then U to (5,5), then U to (5,6) to eat.\n\nSo 4 moves.\n\nLife span of (5,6) is 6 at turn 23, so at turn 26, how many left?\n\nAt turn 23, life span 6.\n\nTurn 23: after move, if not eaten, life span decreases to 5 for turn 24? Let's track.\n\nTurn 23: start, life span 6\n\nAfter turn 23 move, if not eaten, life span 5 for turn 24\n\nTurn 24: start life span 5, after move if not eaten, life span 4 for turn 25\n\nTurn 25: start life span 4, after move if not eaten, life span 3 for turn 26\n\nTurn 26: start life span 3, after move if eaten on (5,6) on turn 26? No, I am at (3,4) on turn 26, eating there.\n\nOn turn 26, I eat (3,4), so for (5,6), not eaten.\n\nAfter turn 26 move, life span of (5,6) decreases to 2 for turn 27.\n\nThen I can eat on turn 27 to 29.\n\nAt turn 26 after eating (3,4), head at (3,4)\n\nTurn 27: move to (4,4) R\n\nTurn 28: move to (5,4) R\n\nTurn 29: move to (5,5) U\n\nTurn 30: move to (5,6) U, eat.\n\nBut at turn 30, (5,6) life span: after turn 26, span 2 for turn 27\n\nTurn 27: not eaten, after turn 27, span 1 for turn 28\n\nTurn 28: not eaten, after turn 28, span 0 for turn 29, so disappears, not available on turn 29.\n\nLife span at start of turn:\n\nTurn 23: 6\n\nAfter turn 23: if not eaten, span 5 for turn 24\n\nTurn 24: not eaten, after turn 24, span 4 for turn 25\n\nTurn 25: not eaten, after turn 25, span 3 for turn 26\n\nTurn 26: not eaten (since ate (3,4)), after turn 26, span 2 for turn 27\n\nTurn 27: not eaten, after turn 27, span 1 for turn 28\n\nTurn 28: not eaten, after turn 28, span 0, gone for turn 29.\n\nSo on turn 28, if I move to (5,6), I can eat it, since life span 1 at start of turn 28, I move to it, eat.\n\nBut in my plan, on turn 28, I am at (5,4), moving to (5,5), not to (5,6).\n\nTo eat on turn 28, I need to be at (5,6) on turn 28 move.\n\nAt turn 27 start, I am at (4,4) after turn 27 move? Let's sequence.\n\nAfter turn 26: head at (3,4)\n\nTurn 27: move R to (4,4) — now at (4,4)\n\nTurn 28: move R to (5,4) — now at (5,4)\n\nTurn 29: move U to (5,5) — but (5,6) is gone after turn 28, since span 0 for turn 29.\n\nOn turn 28, at (5,4), I can move to (5,5) or (6,4) or (5,3), but not to (5,6) since not adjacent.\n\n(5,4) to (5,6) is not adjacent, need to go through (5,5).\n\nBut on turn 28, I am at (5,4), and (5,6) can be eaten only if I move directly to it, but I can't from (5,4).\n\nThe only way to eat (5,6) on turn 28 is to be at an adjacent cell on turn 28 start, like (5,5), (4,6), (6,6), or (5,7) but y=7 wall.\n\n(4,6) is obstacle, so only (5,5) or (6,6).\n\nIf on turn 28 start, I am at (5,5), then move to (5,6) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, if at (6,6), move to (5,6) L or something.\n\nBut from earlier, on turn 28 start, I am at (5,4) if I moved as above.\n\nTo be at (5,5) on turn 28 start, I need to move to (5,5) on turn 27.\n\nBut on turn 27 start, I am at (3,4) or after turn 26.\n\nAfter turn 26: head at (3,4)\n\nTurn 27: I can move directly to (4,4) or to (3,5) or (2,4) or (3,3), but to reach (5,5) quickly.\n\nFrom (3,4) to (5,5): dx=2 right, dy=1 up, min 3 moves.\n\nTurn 27: move to (4,4) R\n\nTurn 28: move to (5,4) R? (5,4) then to (5,5) U on turn 29, but late.\n\nFrom (4,4), I can move U to (4,5) on turn 28.\n\nThen from (4,5), I can move to (5,5) R on turn 29, but (5,6) gone.\n\nTo eat on turn 28, I need to be at (5,5) or (6,6) on turn 28 start.\n\nFor example, from (3,4) on turn 27, I can move to (4,5) if possible, but (4,5) is adjacent? (3,4) to (4,5) is diagonal, not adjacent; only orthogonal moves.\n\nFrom (3,4), possible moves: U to (3,5), D to (3,3), L to (2,4), R to (4,4)\n\n(4,5) is not directly adjacent, so I can't go directly.\n\nShortest to (5,5): (3,4) -> (4,4) on turn 27, then (4,4) -> (4,5) or (5,4) on turn 28.\n\nIf (4,4) to (4,5) U, then at (4,5) on turn 28 start.\n\nThen turn 28 move to (5,5) R? (4,5) to (5,5) is right, yes.\n\nThen at (5,5) on turn 28, but I need to eat (5,6) on turn 28, so from (5,5) move to (5,6) U on turn 28.\n\nYes.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 27: from (3,4) move R to (4,4)\n\nTurn 28: from (4,4) move U to (4,5)  // now at (4,5)\n\nTurn 29: from (4,5) move R to (5,5)  // now at (5,5)\n\nBut to eat (5,6) on turn 28, I need to be at (5,6) on turn 28 move.\n\nAt turn 28 start, I am at (4,4) if I moved to (4,4) on turn 27.\n\nFrom (4,4), I can move to (4,5) U or (5,4) R or (3,4) L or (4,3) D.\n\n(4,5) is free, I assume.\n\nThen after moving to (4,5), I am at turn 29 start at (4,5), then turn 29 move to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut on turn 28, I am at (4,4), and I move to (4,5), not to (5,6).\n\nThe earliest I can be at (5,5) is turn 29 start, if on turn 28 I move to (5,5) from (4,4), but (4,4) to (5,5) not adjacent, must go through (4,5) or (5,4).\n\nSo I can be at (5,5) on turn 29 start.\n\nThen on turn 29, move U to (5,6) to eat.\n\nBut at turn 29, (5,6) is gone, as life span 0.\n\nLife span: for turn 28, at start, life span is 1 (as above), after move, if not eaten, span decreases to 0, gone for turn 29.\n\nSo on turn 28, I can eat (5,6) by moving to it.\n\nBut to do that, at turn 28 start, I need to be at a cell adjacent to (5,6), like (5,5), (4,6), (6,6), (5,7).\n\n(4,6) obstacle, (5,7) y=7 wall, so only (5,5) or (6,6).\n\nSo I need to be at (5,5) or (6,6) on turn 28 start.\n\nFrom (3,4) at turn 27 start, how to reach (5,5) by turn 28.\n\nTurn 27: move from (3,4) to some cell, to be at (5,5) on turn 28 start? That means on turn 27 move, I go to (5,5), but from (3,4) to (5,5) is not adjacent, impossible in one move.\n\nSimilarly, to (6,6) even farther.\n\nSo impossible to eat (5,6) on turn 28; the latest is turn 28, but I can't reach it from (3,4) in time.\n\nAt turn 26, I am at (3,4), and (5,6) can be eaten on turn 27 or 28 if I can reach.\n\nOn turn 27: if I move to (5,6) from adjacent cell at turn 27 start.\n\nAt turn 27 start, I am at (3,4), not adjacent to (5,6).\n\nMin distance 4, so impossible to reach on turn 27 or 28.\n\nTherefore, from after eating (3,4), I cannot reach (5,6) in time to eat it; it will disappear uneaten.\n\nSimilarly, if I don't eat (3,4) first, but go directly to (5,6).\n\nBut from current position, (5,6) is farther.\n\nAt turn 23, head at (4,1)\n\nTo (5,6): dx=1, dy=5, min 6 moves.\n\nCan eat by turn 28.\n\nTurn 23: move to say (4,2) U\n\nTurn 24: to (4,3) U\n\nTurn 25: to (4,4) U\n\nTurn 26: to (4,5) U\n\nTurn 27: to (5,5) R or (4,6) invalid, so to (5,5) R\n\nThen turn 28: to (5,6) U, eat.\n\nYes, on turn 28.\n\nLife span: turn 28 start life span 1, eat on turn 28, ok.\n\nIf I go faster, but min 6 moves from (4,1) to (5,6): for example, (4,1)->(4,2)->(4,3)->(4,4)->(4,5)->(5,5)->(5,6), 6 moves, turns 23 to 28.\n\nTurn 23 move to (4,2), turn 24 to (4,3), turn 25 to (4,4), turn 26 to (4,5), turn 27 to (5,5), turn 28 to (5,6) eat.\n\n(4,5) to (5,5) is possible, and (5,5) to (5,6).\n\nNow, are there obstacles? (4,6) is obstacle, but I'm not going there.\n\n(4,5) is free.\n\nSimilarly, I can eat (3,4) later, but (3,4) has life span 9, so after turn 28, I can go to (3,4).\n\nBut let's see the choice at turn 23.\n\nIf I go U to (4,2), then I can head to (5,6) to eat on turn 28.\n\nIf I go L to (3,1), I can eat (3,4) on turn 26, but then (5,6) is too far to eat.\n\n(5,6) gives +1, (3,4) gives +1, same value.\n\nBut by going to (5,6) directly, I eat one food, and (3,4) can be eaten later since long life.\n\nIf I go to (3,4) first, I eat one, but (5,6) disappears.\n\nSo better to go for (5,6) to not miss it.\n\nMoreover, after eating (5,6), I can go to (3,4).\n\nBut let's confirm if the path is safe.\n\nFirst, at turn 23, from (4,1), move U to (4,2)\n\nThen turn 24: from (4,2), move U to (4,3)\n\nIs (4,3) free? Current at turn 24 start: after turn 23 move, positions: head (4,2), then (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) tail? Earlier calculation.\n\nAfter turn 23 move U to (4,2):\n\nNew positions: head (4,2), body: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) tail at (5,3)\n\n(5,4) free.\n\nNow (4,3) not occupied, free.\n\nMove U to (4,3)\n\nTurn 25: head to (4,3), body: (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) — index 6 moves to (6,3)? Positions: index 1 to (4,2), index 2 to (4,1), index 3 to (5,1), index 4 to (6,1), index 5 to (6,2), index 6 to (6,3)\n\nNew: (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) tail at (6,3)\n\n(5,3) free.\n\nThen turn 25: move U to (4,4)\n\nHead to (4,4), body: (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nThen turn 26: move U to (4,5)\n\nHead to (4,5), body: (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nTail at (6,2)\n\nThen turn 27: move R to (5,5)  // (4,5) to (5,5) is right\n\nIs (5,5) free? Yes.\n\nHead to (5,5), body: (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\nThen turn 28: move U to (5,6), eat.\n\n(5,6) is food, so eat, grow.\n\nNew positions: head (5,6), body (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), and new tail at previous tail position? After move, body: index 1 to (5,5), index 2 to (4,5), ..., index 6 to (5,1), and new segment at (6,1)? Let's see.\n\nAfter turn 27: positions (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)? After turn 27 move: head (5,5), body: (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) — index 6 is (6,1)\n\nTail (6,1)\n\nTurn 28: move to (5,6)\n\nHead to (5,6) eat\n\nBody: index 1 moves to where head was (5,5)\n\nIndex 2 to where index 1 was (4,5)\n\n...\n\nIndex 6 to where index 5 was (5,1)\n\nIndex 5 was (5,1), moves to where index 4 was (4,1)\n\nList:\n\nPrevious positions turn 28 start: (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\nIndex: 0:(5,5), 1:(4,5), 2:(4,4), 3:(4,3), 4:(4,2), 5:(4,1), 6:(5,1), 7:(6,1) tail? Length 8? After turn 27, no eat, so length 7 positions? Earlier.\n\nAt turn 27 after move to (5,5), positions: head (5,5), and body segments from previous: after turn 26, positions (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) but (6,1) was tail.\n\nWhen moved to (5,5) on turn 27, body: index 1 to where head was (4,5), index 2 to where index 1 was (4,4), ..., up to index 6 to where index 5 was (5,1), and index 7? No, length is fixed until eat.\n\nAt turn 26 after move to (4,5), positions: head (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) — 7 positions.\n\nTurn 27 move to (5,5): head to (5,5), body: index 1 to (4,5), index 2 to (4,4), index 3 to (4,3), index 4 to (4,2), index 5 to (4,1), index 6 to (5,1)\n\nNew positions: (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) — tail at (5,1)\n\n(6,1) is free now.\n\nThen turn 28 move to (5,6): head to (5,6), body: index 1 to (5,5), index 2 to (4,5), index 3 to (4,4), index 4 to (4,3), index 5 to (4,2), index 6 to (4,1)\n\nAnd since ate, new segment added at previous tail position (5,1), so positions: (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)\n\nNow, after that, I can go to eat (3,4), which is still available, life span 9 at turn 23, so at turn 28, how many left?\n\nTurn 23: span 9\n\nAfter turn 23: span 8 for turn 24\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 27: span 9 - 5 = 4? Turns: after turn 23, span 8; turn 24, span 7; turn 25, span 6; turn 26, span 5; turn 27, span 4; after turn 27, span 3 for turn 28.\n\nTurn 28: eat (5,6), so (3,4) not eaten.\n\nAfter turn 28, span decreases to 2 for turn 29.\n\nSo available until turn 30? Turn 28 start span 3, after not eaten, span 2 for turn 29; turn 29 start span 2, after not eaten, span 1 for turn 30; turn 30 start span 1, can eat; after turn 30, span 0 gone.\n\nSo can eat on turn 30.\n\nNow from (5,6), I can go to (3,4).\n\n(5,6) to (3,4): dx=2 left, dy=2 down, min 4 moves.\n\nBut need to avoid obstacles.\n\nFor example, (5,6) to (5,5) D, then (5,4) D, then (4,4) L, then (3,4) L.\n\nOr shorter paths.\n\nBut (4,6) obstacle, so no issue.\n\nOn turn 29, from (5,6), I can move D to (5,5), but (5,5) is body? After eating, positions include (5,5), which is the first body segment, so moving to (5,5) would collide.\n\nAfter turn 28 eat: positions (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)\n\nSo (5,5) is occupied by body, cannot move there.\n\nSimilarly, other directions: U to (5,7) wall, L to (4,6) obstacle, R to (6,6) may be free.\n\n(6,6) not occupied, and not wall.\n\nSo from (5,6), possible moves: D to (5,5) but body, invalid; U invalid; L invalid; R to (6,6) possible.\n\nSo must move R to (6,6).\n\nThen from there, I can go down to (6,5), etc., to reach (3,4).\n\nBut (3,4) is at (3,4), so from (6,6) to (3,4) is longer.\n\nSince I need to go down and left.\n\nBut with time, I can reach.\n\nFor example, turn 29: from (5,6) move R to (6,6)\n\nTurn 30: move D to (6,5)\n\nTurn 31: move D to (6,4)\n\nThen turn 32: move L to (5,4), but (5,4) may be free, then to (4,4), etc.\n\nBut (3,4) can be eaten by turn 30, as above.\n\nFrom (6,6), I can go L to (5,6) but occupied, or D to (6,5), then to (5,5) L? (6,5) to (5,5) L.\n\n(5,5) was body, but after moving, it might be free.\n\nAfter turn 29 move to (6,6), positions: head (6,6), body: (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) — tail (5,1)\n\n(5,5) is occupied.\n\nThen turn 30: move D to (6,5)\n\nHead to (6,5), body: (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1) — tail (4,1)? Index: after move, index 1 to (6,6), index 2 to (5,6), ..., index 7 to (4,2), index 8 to (4,1)\n\nNew tail at (4,1)\n\n(5,1) free.\n\n(5,5) still occupied.\n\nThen from (6,5), I can move L to (5,5), but (5,5) is body segment, so collision, cannot.\n\nMove D to (6,4), or R to (7,5) x=7 wall, invalid, or U to (6,6) but occupied.\n\nSo only D to (6,4) or L to (5,5) invalid, so must go D to (6,4).\n\nThen to (6,3), but (6,3) may be part of body later, but currently not.\n\nThen eventually to (3,4).\n\nBut it might take many turns, and I might hit body.\n\nSince (3,4) is available, I can find a path, but it could be risky with the long body.\n\nBack to turn 23 choice.\n\nIf I go L to (3,1) first, I eat (3,4) quickly on turn 26, but miss (5,6).\n\nThen (5,6) disappears, but I have the food at (3,4), and I can explore other areas, but no other food mentioned, so perhaps only these, and I might need to survive.\n\nBut the goal is to maximize score, so eating both is better.\n\nBy going to (5,6) first, I eat one, and possibly eat (3,4) later.\n\nBut in the path above, after eating (5,6), I am at (5,6) or (6,6), and need to go down to (3,4), which might take time, but with life span, I can.\n\n(3,4) life span 9 at turn 23, so at turn 28, after 5 turns, span 9-5=4 left, so until turn 31 or so, as before.\n\nFrom (5,6) to (3,4), min 4 moves, but with body, it might be blocked.\n\nFor example, after eating (5,6), at turn 28, positions (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)\n\nFrom (5,6), I can only move R to (6,6), as other directions blocked.\n\nThen to (6,5), (6,4), etc.\n\n(3,4) is at (3,4), so I can go from (6,4) to (5,4) to (4,4) to (3,4).\n\n(4,4) is occupied in the body, but after moving, it might be free.\n\nAt turn 28, after eat, head at (5,6), body (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), etc.\n\nIf I move R to (6,6) on turn 28? Turn 28 I just ate, so at turn 29 start.\n\nTurn 29: from (5,6) move R to (6,6)\n\nThen turn 30: move D to (6,5)\n\nTurn 31: move D to (6,4)\n\nTurn 32: move L to (5,4)\n\n(5,4) should be free.\n\nThen turn 33: move L to (4,4)\n\nBut (4,4) is in the body? At this point, after several moves, the body has moved.\n\nFor example, after turn 32, when at (5,4), the body is different.\n\nBut (4,4) might be occupied or not.\n\nTo avoid risk, perhaps it's better to go for (3,4) first since it's closer and safer.\n\nAnother option: at turn 23, go U to (4,2), but instead of going all the way up, go left after that to (3,4) faster.\n\nFrom (4,1), go U to (4,2) turn 23.\n\nThen turn 24, from (4,2) move L to (3,2)\n\nTurn 25, from (3,2) move U to (3,3)\n\nTurn 26, from (3,3) move U to (3,4) eat.\n\nSame as going left first.\n\nThen I eat (3,4) on turn 26, but (5,6) I can't reach.\n\nBut (5,6) can be reached if I go directly after, but from (3,4) to (5,6) min 4 moves, but as before, cannot reach by turn 28.\n\nSo I can only eat one food: either (3,4) or (5,6), not both, because (5,6) disappears early.\n\n(5,6) life span 6, until turn 28, (3,4) until turn 31.\n\nIf I eat (3,4) on turn 26, I have time to eat (5,6) only if I can reach it by turn 28, but from (3,4) to (5,6) min 4 moves, turn 26 to turn 28: on turn 26 I am at (3,4), turn 27 move to say (4,4), turn 28 move to (5,4) or (4,5), not to (5,6), so I can be at (5,5) on turn 28, but (5,6) can be eaten on turn 28 only if I move to it, but from (5,5) I can, but I am not at (5,5) on turn 28 start.\n\nOn turn 27 start at (3,4), move to (4,4) on turn 27, at turn 28 start at (4,4), then move to (4,5) U or (5,4) R, not to (5,6).\n\nSo cannot eat (5,6) after eating (3,4) first.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat (5,6) first on turn 28, I can eat (3,4) later.\n\nSo net, I can eat both if I go for (5,6) first, and then (3,4), but with risk in the body.\n\nIf I go for (3,4) first, I eat only one.\n\nSo better to go for (5,6) to eat both.\n\nMoreover, in the path to (5,6), I am moving up the left side, which is open.\n\nIn the beginning, if I go U to (4,2), it seems safe.\n\nIf I go L to (3,1), I might be in a corner.\n\nFor example, from (3,1), I go up to (3,4), but after eating, I am at (3,4) with body trailing down, and to go to (5,6), I have to go right, but the body might block.\n\nWhereas in the other path, I am on the right.\n\nBut in this case, for maximizing score, I should choose to go U at turn 23 to reach (5,6).\n\nThen the action for turn 23 is U.\n\nBut the answer should be for multiple turns, but the question is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but since I need to think ahead, but output only the actions, but I have to specify for the current turn and future turns.\n\nThe answer format is to box the actions for several turns.\n\nBut I don't have to plan all, but at least for turn 23.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output for the current state.\n\nI think for turn 23, I should move U.\n\nThen for future turns, I can outline.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is a better move.\n\nAnother food: (1,6) is gone, so only two.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (3,4) quickly and then go somewhere, but (5,6) is lost.\n\nWhereas by going up, I eat (5,6) and possibly (3,4).\n\nAlso, after eating (5,6), I can go to (3,4) via a safe path.\n\nFor example, from (5,6), move R to (6,6), then down to (6,4), then left to (5,4), (4,4), but (4,4) might be free after some moves, then to (3,4).\n\n(3,4) is at (3,4), so from (4,4) to (3,4) L.\n\nAnd since life span long, it should be ok.\n\nMoreover, to avoid the body, I can move in a way that the tail moves away.\n\nBut in this case, for turn 23, move U.\n\nThen turn 24: U to (4,3)\n\nTurn 25: U to (4,4)\n\nTurn 26: U to (4,5)\n\nTurn 27: R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 28: U to (5,6) eat\n\nThen for later turns, to go to (3,4), but not specified.\n\nBut the output should be for the current turn and perhaps a few, but the format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to provide a sequence.\n\nHow many turns? It doesn't specify, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide for 5 turns or so.\n\nBut actions depend on the state, so I can plan a sequence assuming no issues.\n\nFor example, from turn 23 to 28 as above.\n\nAt turn 23, move U to (4,2)\n\nTurn 24: from (4,2), move U to (4,3)\n\nTurn 25: from (4,3), move U to (4,4)\n\nTurn 26: from (4,4), move U to (4,5)\n\nTurn 27: from (4,5), move R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 28: from (5,5), move U to (5,6) eat\n\nThen after that, I can go to (3,4), for example.\n\nBut for the answer, I can provide up to turn 28.\n\nSince turn 23 to 28 is 6 turns.\n\nBut at turn 27, from (4,5) to (5,5), is it always possible? In this case, yes, as per earlier.\n\nSimilarly, no issues.\n\nIf I go L at turn 23, I can only eat one, so worse.\n\nTherefore, for turn 23, action U.\n\nThen for the sequence.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score, the AI must prioritize eating both available positive food items while ensuring long-term survival. The food at (1,6) has a short life span (disappears after turn 25) and is unreachable in time from the starting position (4,1), so it is ignored. The food at (5,6) must be eaten by turn 28 due to its life span, and the food at (3,4) has a longer life span (disappears after turn 31) and can be eaten later. \n\nFrom the current position (4,1) with head direction left (L), the only valid moves are up (U) or left (L), as down (D) leads to a wall and right (R) is an instant reverse. Moving up (U) to (4,2) on turn 23 allows a path to (5,6) by turn 28, eating that food. Afterward, the snake can navigate to (3,4) to eat the second food, leveraging its long life span.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Path to (5,6)**: From (4,1), moving up repeatedly to (4,5) by turn 26, then right to (5,5) on turn 27, and up to (5,6) on turn 28 to eat. This avoids collisions and walls.\n- **Path to (3,4) after (5,6)**: From (5,6), move right to (6,6) on turn 29 (other directions blocked by body or walls), then down to (6,4) by turn 31, and left to (3,4) by turn 32 or earlier. The life span of (3,4) allows this.\n- **Risks Avoided**: \n  - No body collisions: The planned path keeps the head away from body segments except when safe (e.g., moving into former tail positions after movement).\n  - Tail reward danger: No food is on the tail initially, and the path ensures no such situation arises.\n  - Wall and obstacle: The obstacle at (4,6) is avoided by not moving left from (4,5) or similar.\n- **Score Maximization**: Eating both foods scores +2. Missing (5,6) by eating (3,4) first would lose the +1 from (5,6), as it disappears by turn 28.\n\n### Planned Actions (Turns 23 to 28):\n- **Turn 23**: Move U (up) to (4,2) – Starts the ascent toward (5,6); avoids the left move which would commit to (3,4) and miss (5,6).\n- **Turn 24**: Move U (up) to (4,3) – Continues vertical path; position (4,3) is free and safe.\n- **Turn 25**: Move U (up) to (4,4) – Advances closer to (4,5); no body or wall issues.\n- **Turn 26**: Move U (up) to (4,5) – Reaches row y=5; prepares for the right turn.\n- **Turn 27**: Move R (right) to (5,5) – Moves east toward (5,6); (5,5) is free and not a reverse (current direction is U).\n- **Turn 28**: Move U (up) to (5,6) – Eats the food; head direction now U.\n\nThis sequence eats (5,6) on turn 28, just before it disappears. After turn 28, the snake can proceed to (3,4) as described, eating it by turn 32 for additional score.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 23: U \\\\\nTurn 24: U \\\\\nTurn 25: U \\\\\nTurn 26: U \\\\\nTurn 27: R \\\\\nTurn 28: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 24, and I have to plan my moves for the next few turns to maximize score while avoiding risks. I should think at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nThe grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells range from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm: x from 0 to 7, but walls are at x=0 and x=7, so the playable area is x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6. Similarly for y. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: head at (4,2), and body segments: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3). So let's list them in order:\n\n- Head: (4,2)\n\n- Then: (4,1)  // this is directly below head? Head is at (4,2), moving Up? Head direction is U, which is up, so y increases? In the movement constraints, U is (x,y+1), so up increases y.\n\nTypically in grids, (0,0) is top-left or bottom-left? The problem doesn't specify, but since U is (x,y+1), that might imply y increases upward, like in math coordinates. But in many games, y increases downward. I need to be careful.\n\nLook: U (x,y+1) – if y+1 is up, that means y increases as you go up, like Cartesian coordinates where (0,0) is bottom-left. But in grid terms, often (0,0) is top-left with y increasing down. The problem says U (x,y+1), so let's assume (0,0) is bottom-left, so y increases up.\n\nBut walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders. Similarly, x=0 and x=7.\n\nIn the food positions, we have (1,6), (5,6), (3,4). y=6 is high, so if y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top wall, so y=6 is near the top.\n\nSnake positions: head at (4,2), which is low y if y=0 is bottom.\n\nHead direction is U, up, so last move was up to (4,2).\n\nNow, snake body: from head (4,2), then (4,1) – that's below, so if head moved up to (4,2), previous position was (4,1), which is consistent with moving up.\n\nThen next segment is (5,1) – not (4, something), (4,1) to (5,1)? That doesn't seem adjacent. Let's list all positions:\n\nSnake positions: [(4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)]\n\nSo from (4,2) to (4,1): that's down? But head direction is U, meaning it just moved up to (4,2) from (4,1)? Positions are given with head first, so the head is at (4,2), and the segment behind it is (4,1), meaning the snake was at (4,1) before moving to (4,2). So it moved up from (4,1) to (4,2).\n\nThen next is (5,1). (4,1) to (5,1) is right? But (4,1) is the second segment, which was the head when it was at (4,1), but now it's the body.\n\nThe positions trace the snake: head at (4,2), then the first body segment at (4,1), which is directly below, then next body segment at (5,1), which is to the right of (4,1)? (4,1) to (5,1) is one unit right, but (4,1) is at y=1, x=4, (5,1) at x=5,y=1, so right.\n\nThen (6,1), which is further right.\n\nThen (6,2), up from (6,1).\n\nThen (6,3), up from (6,2).\n\nThen (5,3), left from (6,3).\n\nSo the tail is at (5,3).\n\nNow, the snake length is 7 segments? Positions: 7 items, so length 7.\n\nNow, food:\n\n- (1,6,2,1) : position (1,6), value 1, life span 2\n\n- (5,6,5,1) : (5,6), value 1, life span 5\n\n- (3,4,8,1) : (3,4), value 1, life span 8\n\nAll food has value +1, so positive food.\n\nLife span: for (1,6), life span 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? So at turn 24, life span 2, so it will disappear after turn 25? Let's see the rule: \"disappears after N turns (N = life_span), countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo at turn 24, life span 2, so after this turn (turn 24), countdown to 1, then after turn 25, countdown to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 24 or 25, but not after.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) life span 5, so disappears after turn 28? Turn 24: life span 5, after turn 24: 4, turn 25:3, ..., turn 28: after turn 28, countdown 0, disappear. Can be eaten up to turn 28.\n\n(3,4) life span 8, disappears after turn 31.\n\nNow, head at (4,2), direction U (up). So possible moves: since just moved up, I can move U, L, or R? No instant reverse, so cannot move down (D), because that would be opposite to current direction U.\n\nCurrent direction is U, so I can move U (continue up), L (left), or R (right). Not D.\n\nNow, let's see the grid. Playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, since walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7. And internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is a wall cell, so I cannot move there.\n\nNow, snake body: let's list all occupied cells to avoid collision.\n\nSnake positions: (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nSo occupied: (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nNow, food at (1,6), (5,6), (3,4)\n\n(5,6) is at x=5,y=6, but there's an internal obstacle at (4,6), so (5,6) is not blocked, but (4,6) is wall.\n\ny=6 is the top row, since y=7 is wall.\n\nNow, head at (4,2), I need to plan moves.\n\nFirst, possible actions this turn (turn 24): U, L, R (not D)\n\nIf I move U, to (4,3)\n\nIf L, to (3,2)\n\nIf R, to (5,2)\n\nNow, (5,2): is it occupied? Snake has (5,1), (6,1), etc., but (5,2) is not in the list. Positions: (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) — no (5,2), so (5,2) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) not occupied, (4,3) not occupied.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, check for food: (3,4) is food, but not adjacent yet.\n\n(1,6) and (5,6) are far.\n\n(5,6) is at (5,6), which is top row, and head at (4,2), so not close.\n\n(3,4) is at (3,4), which is closer.\n\nFrom (4,2), to reach (3,4), I could go left then up, or up then left, etc.\n\nBut let's think about the tail and growth.\n\nImportant rule: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because of collision.\n\nTail is at (5,3). What cells are adjacent to tail? (5,3) has neighbors: (5,2), (5,4), (4,3), (6,3)\n\n(6,3) is part of body, since (6,3) is a segment.\n\nBody segments: (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) — so (6,3) is occupied, (5,3) is tail.\n\nSo adjacent cells to tail: (5,2), (5,4), (4,3), (6,3) but (6,3) is occupied, so only (5,2), (5,4), (4,3) are free? (5,4) might be free, etc.\n\nBut only if head is on one of these and tail has food, but tail at (5,3) has no food? Food is at (1,6), (5,6), (3,4), not at (5,3), so no food on tail. So no immediate danger.\n\nBut if I move to a cell adjacent to tail, and if that cell has food, but the food is not on tail, it might be ok, but the danger is only if the food is on the tail cell itself when head is adjacent.\n\nRule: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake...\"\n\nSo in this case, tail cell is (5,3), no food there, so no danger.\n\nNow, I need to consider food life spans.\n\n(1,6) has life span 2 at turn 24, so it will disappear after turn 25. So only available on turn 24 and 25.\n\n(5,6) life span 5, available until turn 28.\n\n(3,4) life span 8, long time.\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), which is top-left corner, x=1,y=6.\n\nHead at (4,2), so to reach (1,6), I need to go left and up, but it's 5 steps away? Manhattan distance: |4-1| + |2-6| = 3 + 4 = 7 cells away, so at least 7 moves, but since life span 2, I can only reach it in 2 moves? From (4,2) to (1,6) in 2 moves? Impossible, min moves: need to move left 3 times and up 4 times, but only 2 moves, so I cannot reach (1,6) at all. It will disappear before I can get there.\n\nDistance: from (4,2) to (1,6): delta x = 3 left, delta y = 4 up. So min moves: since I can move diagonally? No, only orthogonal moves, one cell at a time. So I need at least 3 left and 4 up, total 7 moves. With only 2 turns left (including current), I can move only 2 steps, so I can get to, say, (2,4) or something, but not to (1,6). So (1,6) is unreachable and will disappear soon. I should ignore it.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) at (5,6), head at (4,2), delta x=1 right? |5-4|=1, |6-2|=4, so min moves: 1 right and 4 up, total 5 moves. Life span 5, so it can be reached if I go directly.\n\n(5,6) life span 5 at turn 24, so available until turn 28, and I can reach it in 5 moves, e.g., by moving right and up.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) at (3,4), delta x=1 left, delta y=2 up, min 3 moves, life span 8, plenty of time.\n\nBut (3,4) is closer and easier.\n\nNow, also, the internal obstacle at (4,6), which might affect path to (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is at (5,6), obstacle at (4,6), so to reach (5,6), I can go via (5,5) or (6,6), but (6,6) is corner? Walls at x=7,y=7, so (6,6) is playable.\n\nx=6,y=6 is within 1-6.\n\nNow, let's think about the snake's body and possible collisions.\n\nCurrent head position (4,2), moving U, L, or R.\n\nIf I move U to (4,3): then new head (4,3), tail will move? After move, the snake moves, head to new position, tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed unless food eaten.\n\nNo food at (4,3), so if I move U, head to (4,3), body follows, so tail at (5,3) moves off, new tail is the previous second last, which is (6,3)? Positions: after move, if no eat, head moves to (4,3), then body segments: previous head (4,2) becomes first body, then (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), and tail (5,3) is removed. So new positions: head (4,3), then (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) — (5,3) is gone.\n\nOriginal: indices: 0:head (4,2), 1:(4,1), 2:(5,1), 3:(6,1), 4:(6,2), 5:(6,3), 6:tail (5,3)\n\nAfter moving U to (4,3) without eating: new head (4,3), then body: segment 0 becomes body at (4,2), segment 1 at (4,1), segment 2 at (5,1), segment 3 at (6,1), segment 4 at (6,2), segment 5 at (6,3), and segment 6 (tail) is removed, so new tail is (6,3), which was segment 5.\n\nNew positions: head (4,3), body: (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) — so tail at (6,3).\n\nSimilarly, if move L to (3,2): head to (3,2), body: (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), tail (5,3) removed, new tail (6,3).\n\nIf move R to (5,2): head to (5,2), body: (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), tail (5,3) removed? Body: previous head (4,2) to body, then (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), and (5,3) removed, so new tail (6,3).\n\nIn all cases, since no food, tail is removed, new tail is the previous (6,3).\n\nNow, (6,3) is now the tail.\n\nBut (5,3) had no food, so no issue.\n\nNow, I need to plan multiple turns.\n\nAlso, the food at (3,4) is close, only 2 steps away if I go directly.\n\nFrom (4,2), if I move L to (3,2), then next move U to (3,3), then U to (3,4) to eat on turn 26? Turn 24: move to (3,2), turn 25: move to (3,3), turn 26: move to (3,4) to eat.\n\n(3,4) has life span 8, so available.\n\nBut I need to check if (3,4) is under snake body? Snake body has positions, (3,4) not in list, so free.\n\nBut when I eat, the snake grows, so tail doesn't move.\n\nSimilarly, I could go for (5,6), but it's farther.\n\n(5,6) life span 5, so I have time.\n\nBut (1,6) is impossible, ignore.\n\nNow, let's consider the grid and obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), which might block paths to top.\n\nAlso, walls at borders.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should eat all food, but need to avoid dead ends or collisions.\n\nFirst, from current position (4,2), direction U.\n\nOptions:\n\n- Move U to (4,3): then head at (4,3), direction U.\n\nFrom there, I can go U to (4,4), L to (3,3), R to (5,3)\n\n(5,3) is currently the tail, but after this move, if I move U on turn 24, tail is at (6,3), so (5,3) is free now? After move to (4,3), positions: (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) — so (5,3) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3) might be free.\n\n- Move L to (3,2): head at (3,2), direction L (since I moved left).\n\nThen from there, possible moves: cannot move R (reverse), so can move U, D, L.\n\nU to (3,3), D to (3,1), L to (2,2)\n\n(3,1) is? Snake has (4,1), (5,1), etc., but (3,1) not occupied, should be free.\n\n- Move R to (5,2): head at (5,2), direction R.\n\nThen can move U, D, R (not L, reverse).\n\nU to (5,3), D to (5,1), R to (6,2)\n\n(5,1) is occupied by body? After move to (5,2), positions: head (5,2), body (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) — so (5,1) is body, cannot move there. (6,2) is body? (6,2) is segment, occupied. (5,3) might be free.\n\nAfter move R to (5,2), body: (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) — so cells occupied: (5,2) head, (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nSo (5,3) is free, (6,2) occupied, (5,1) occupied.\n\nSo from (5,2), I can move U to (5,3), or D to (5,1) but (5,1) occupied, so cannot, or R to (6,2) but (6,2) occupied, so only possible move is U to (5,3)? But I can move U, D, R, but D and R are blocked, so only U possible? That seems bad.\n\nCurrent at (5,2), possible moves:\n\n- U: (5,3) — is it free? Yes, not occupied.\n\n- D: (5,1) — occupied by body, so cannot, collision.\n\n- R: (6,2) — occupied by body, cannot.\n\n- L: but L is reverse? Current direction after moving R is R, so cannot move L (opposite).\n\nSo from (5,2), only U is possible? That's a trap, because after moving, I might be stuck.\n\nIf I move R on turn 24 to (5,2), then on turn 25, I can only move U to (5,3).\n\nThen at (5,3), what next? Direction U (since moved up).\n\nThen can move U, L, R? Not D.\n\nU to (5,4), L to (4,3), R to (6,3)\n\n(6,3) is occupied? After previous moves.\n\nAfter turn 24: move R to (5,2), positions: head (5,2), body (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) — tail at (6,3)\n\nThen turn 25: move U to (5,3), no eat, so head to (5,3), body: (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), tail (6,3) removed, new tail (6,2)? Positions: head (5,3), body (5,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) — so tail at (6,2)\n\nNow at (5,3), direction U.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U to (5,4): free?\n\n- L to (4,3): free?\n\n- R to (6,3): but (6,3) was tail, now removed, so free? (6,3) not occupied now.\n\nIn positions above, (6,3) is removed, so (6,3) free.\n\nAlso, (4,3) should be free.\n\n(5,4) free.\n\nSo from (5,3), I can move U, L, or R.\n\nBut if I go to (5,4), etc.\n\nBut earlier, moving R on turn 24 leads to (5,2), which only allows U to (5,3), not immediately dangerous, but limits options.\n\nBut I have food to eat.\n\nSimilarly, if I move L to (3,2), I can go to (3,3) then to (3,4) to eat.\n\n(3,4) is food.\n\nIf I move U to (4,3), I can go to (3,3) or (4,4), etc.\n\nNow, let's think about (5,6) food.\n\n(5,6) is at top, with obstacle at (4,6).\n\nTo reach (5,6), I need to approach from left, right, or below.\n\nBut (4,6) blocked, so cannot come from (4,5) to (5,6)? (5,6) neighbors: (5,5), (5,7) but y=7 wall, (4,6) wall, (6,6)\n\nSo only accessible from (5,5) or (6,6).\n\n(6,6) is playable.\n\nBut (6,6) might be occupied or not.\n\nCurrently free.\n\nNow, since (5,6) has life span 5, I can go for it after eating closer food.\n\nBut (3,4) is closer and can be eaten soon.\n\nAlso, after eating, snake grows, so I need space to move.\n\nCurrent length 7.\n\nIf I eat (3,4), length becomes 8.\n\nNow, let's plan a sequence.\n\nFirst, I should go for (3,4) since it's close and no time pressure.\n\nFrom (4,2), move L to (3,2) on turn 24.\n\nThen on turn 25, from (3,2), I can move U to (3,3) (since direction L, cannot R, but U and D possible).\n\nThen on turn 26, move U to (3,4) and eat, since (3,4) is food.\n\nAfter eating on turn 26, head at (3,4), and tail doesn't move, so snake grows to 8 segments.\n\nNow, what about the food at (5,6)? I can go there next.\n\nBut from (3,4) to (5,6), need to move right and up.\n\nPath: e.g., (3,4) to (4,4) to (5,4) to (5,5) to (5,6), 4 moves.\n\nOr shorter? (3,4) to (4,4) to (4,5) but (4,5) to (5,6)? (4,5) to (5,6) is right and up, but not adjacent; (4,5) and (5,6) are not adjacent, diagonal not allowed, so must go to (5,5) first.\n\n(4,5) to (5,5) right, then (5,5) to (5,6) up.\n\nSimilarly, from (3,4), I could go (3,4) to (3,5) but y=5, then to (4,5), etc., but longer.\n\nMin moves: from (3,4) to (5,6): delta x=2 right, delta y=2 up, min 4 moves.\n\n(5,6) life span: at turn 24, life 5, so available until after turn 28? Turn 24: life 5, after turn 24:4, turn25:3, turn26:2, turn27:1, turn28:0 disappear after turn28.\n\nSo can be eaten on turn 28 or before.\n\nOn turn 26, I eat at (3,4), so head at (3,4) on turn 26.\n\nThen on turn 27, I can move to, say, (4,4)\n\nTurn 28, to (5,4) or (4,5), etc.\n\nTo reach (5,6) by turn 28.\n\nTurn 26: at (3,4) after eating.\n\nTurn 27: move to (4,4) — for example.\n\nTurn 28: from (4,4), move to (5,4) or (4,5)\n\nIf to (5,4), then turn 29: to (5,5), but (5,6) disappears after turn 28, so on turn 28, I need to be at (5,6) to eat.\n\nLife span: on turn 24, life 5, meaning after turn 24, life 4, still present; after turn 25, life 3; ... after turn 28, life 0, disappears. So it can be eaten on any turn up to and including turn 28.\n\nOn turn 28, if I am at (5,6), I can eat it.\n\nNow, from turn 26: head at (3,4)\n\nTurn 27: move to (4,4) — possible, (4,4) should be free.\n\nTurn 28: move to (5,4)\n\nBut (5,4) is not (5,6), I need to go to (5,6).\n\nFrom (4,4) on turn 27, I can move directly to (5,4) or to (4,5).\n\n(4,5) to (5,6) not adjacent, so better to go to (5,4) or (4,5), but from (4,5) to (5,6) requires another move.\n\nAfter (4,4) on turn 27, I can move U to (4,5) or R to (5,4).\n\nIf I move R to (5,4) on turn 27, then turn 28: from (5,4) to (5,5) or to (5,6)? (5,4) to (5,6) not adjacent, must go to (5,5) first, but then on turn 28, I can go to (5,5), not (5,6).\n\nTo eat on turn 28, I need to be at (5,6) on turn 28.\n\nSo on turn 28, I must move to (5,6).\n\nWhere was I on turn 27? I need to be adjacent to (5,6) on turn 27.\n\nAdjacent cells: (5,5), (6,6), or (4,6) but (4,6) obstacle, so only (5,5) and (6,6).\n\nSo on turn 27, I need to be at (5,5) or (6,6) to move to (5,6) on turn 28.\n\nNow, on turn 26, I am at (3,4) after eating.\n\nFrom (3,4), in one move, I can go to (3,5), (2,4), (4,4), (3,3) — but (3,3) down, probably not helpful.\n\nTo reach (5,5) or (6,6) by turn 27.\n\n(5,5) from (3,4): min 3 moves? |3-5|=2, |4-5|=1, so min 3 moves, e.g., (3,4) to (4,4) to (5,4) to (5,5), but that takes to turn 29 for (5,5), too late.\n\n(3,4) to (4,4) turn 27, then to (4,5) or (5,4) turn 28, then to (5,5) turn 29, but (5,6) gone by then.\n\nFaster: (3,4) to (4,4) turn 27, but to be at (5,5) on turn 27, impossible from (3,4) in one move.\n\nTurn 26: at (3,4)\n\nTurn 27: move to one of: (3,5), (2,4), (4,4), (3,3)\n\nNone of these are (5,5) or (6,6); closest is (4,4), but from (4,4) to (5,5) is diagonal, not possible; must move orthogonally.\n\nSo from (4,4) on turn 27, I can move to (4,5) or (5,4) or (3,4) or (4,3), but (3,4) was head, but after move, it's body.\n\nBut to reach (5,5), I need at least two more moves from (3,4): e.g., to (4,4) turn 27, to (5,4) turn 28, to (5,5) turn 29 — but turn 29 is too late, (5,6) disappears after turn 28, so last chance turn 28.\n\nOn turn 28, I need to move to (5,6), so I need to be at a neighbor on turn 27.\n\nBut from turn 26 at (3,4), I cannot reach (5,5) or (6,6) in one move; min distance to (5,5) is 2, so impossible to be adjacent to (5,6) on turn 27 from (3,4).\n\nTherefore, if I eat at (3,4) on turn 26, I cannot reach (5,6) by turn 28; it will disappear before I can eat it.\n\nBut (5,6) life span 5 at turn 24, so on turn 24, life 5; after turn 24, life 4; ... after turn 28, life 0, gone. So on turn 28, it is still there? Countdown: at turn t, life span L, after turn t, it decreases to L-1, and so on, until L=0 after some turn.\n\nRule: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nExample: at turn t, life span L, then after turn t, countdown L-1, meaning at the start of turn t+1, life span is L-1.\n\nThe food is present when life span > 0.\n\nSo at turn t, if life span >0, food is present and can be eaten during turn t.\n\nAfter the turn, life span decreases.\n\nSo for (5,6), life span 5 at turn 24, so present on turn 24,25,26,27,28 (since on turn 28, life span >0 before decrease? Let's clarify.\n\nAt the beginning of turn 24, life span is 5, so food present.\n\nAfter turn 24 actions, life span decreases to 4.\n\nBeginning of turn 25, life span 4, present.\n\nAfter turn 25, to 3.\n\n...\n\nBeginning of turn 28, life span 1, present.\n\nAfter turn 28 actions, life span decreases to 0, so disappears, not present on turn 29.\n\nSo can be eaten on turns 24 to 28 inclusive.\n\nOn turn 28, I can eat it if I move there.\n\nTo eat on turn 28, I need to be on a adjacent cell on turn 27.\n\nFrom turn 26 position, if I am at (3,4) on turn 26 after eating, I can move on turn 27 to, say, (4,4), but (4,4) is not adjacent to (5,6); adjacent cells are (5,5), (6,6), (4,6) blocked.\n\nFrom (4,4) on turn 27, I can move to (5,4) or (4,5), neither adjacent to (5,6).\n\nThen on turn 28, from (5,4) I can move to (5,5) or (6,4), etc., not to (5,6) directly; from (5,4) to (5,6) not adjacent.\n\nTo reach (5,6) on turn 28, I need to be at (5,5) or (6,6) on turn 27.\n\nBut from (3,4) on turn 26, I cannot reach (5,5) or (6,6) in one move; min distance 2 or 3.\n\n(6,6) from (3,4): |3-6|=3, |4-6|=2, min 5 moves, impossible in one.\n\nSo indeed, if I eat at (3,4) on turn 26, I cannot reach (5,6) by turn 28; it will be gone.\n\nTherefore, to eat (5,6), I need to go for it earlier, before eating (3,4).\n\n(3,4) has life span 8, so I can eat it later.\n\n(5,6) is time-sensitive.\n\nSo perhaps prioritize (5,6).\n\nFrom current position (4,2) on turn 24.\n\nMin moves to (5,6): |4-5|=1, |2-6|=4, min 5 moves.\n\nI can reach it in 5 moves, e.g., U,U,U,R,U or something.\n\nBut with obstacles.\n\nPath: from (4,2), move U to (4,3), then U to (4,4), then U to (4,5), but (4,5) to (5,6) not adjacent, and (4,6) is obstacle, so from (4,5), I can move R to (5,5), then U to (5,6).\n\nOr directly.\n\nSequence to reach (5,6) by turn 28.\n\nTurn 24: at (4,2)\n\nI need to be at (5,6) on turn 28 or earlier.\n\nSince 5 moves, I can arrive on turn 29? Turns: turn 24: move, turn 25: move, ..., turn 28: move.\n\nAfter 5 moves, on turn 29 I would be at (5,6) if I start moving towards it.\n\nTurn 24: move 1\n\nTurn 25: move 2\n\nTurn 26: move 3\n\nTurn 27: move 4\n\nTurn 28: move 5, arrive at (5,6)\n\nOn turn 28, I can eat it, since it is present.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, from (4,2), I need to go up and right.\n\nBut with the body.\n\nAlso, after moving, the tail moves, so some cells free up.\n\nBut I need to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, on turn 24, move from (4,2).\n\nTo go to (5,6), I should go up as much as possible, since y needs to increase.\n\nBut I need to go right eventually to x=5.\n\nCurrently x=4, (5,6) x=5.\n\nSo I can move U or R.\n\nIf I move U to (4,3), then I can continue up.\n\nIf I move R to (5,2), but earlier we saw that moving R to (5,2) might be limiting because from (5,2), I can only move U to (5,3), then from (5,3) I can move U, etc.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nAlso, there is food at (3,4) which I can eat later.\n\nNow, for (5,6), I need to be at (5,5) or (6,6) on turn 27 to move to (5,6) on turn 28.\n\nOn turn 27, be at neighbor of (5,6).\n\nThen on turn 28 move to (5,6).\n\nNow, current turn 24.\n\nSo from turn 24 to turn 27, 3 moves to reach a neighbor of (5,6).\n\nNeighbors: (5,5), (6,6), or (4,6) but (4,6) obstacle, so only (5,5) and (6,6).\n\n(5,5) from (4,2): |4-5|=1, |2-5|=3, min 4 moves? But I have 3 moves to turn 27.\n\nTurn 24 move, turn 25 move, turn 26 move, turn 27 position.\n\nSo from turn 24 to turn 27, 3 moves.\n\nFrom (4,2) to (5,5): delta x=1, delta y=3, min 4 moves, impossible in 3 moves.\n\nSimilarly to (6,6): delta x=2, delta y=4, min 6 moves, worse.\n\nBut I don't need to be at (5,5) on turn 27; I need to be at a cell from which I can move to (5,6) on turn 28, so on turn 27, I need to be at (5,5) or (6,6).\n\nBut from (4,2), in 3 moves, can I reach (5,5) or (6,6)? Max I can move is 3 steps, so |delta x| + |delta y| <=3 for reachable cells.\n\n(5,5): |5-4| + |5-2| =1+3=4 >3, impossible.\n\n(6,6): |6-4| + |6-2| =2+4=6>3, impossible.\n\nSo I cannot be at (5,5) or (6,6) on turn 27 from (4,2) in 3 moves.\n\nBut I can be at other cells on turn 27, and on turn 28 move to (5,6), but to move to (5,6) on turn 28, I need to be adjacent on turn 27.\n\nThe only adjacent cells are (5,5) and (6,6), both too far to reach in 3 moves from (4,2).\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to eat (5,6) on turn 28 from current position because I cannot be in position on turn 27 to do so.\n\nBut I can eat it earlier, on turn 25,26,27, or 28.\n\nFor example, on turn 25, if I can reach it.\n\nFrom (4,2), in one move, I can go to (4,3), (3,2), (5,2), none is (5,6), so not on turn 24 or 25 directly.\n\nTurn 25: after one move, at say (4,3), etc., not (5,6).\n\nMin to reach: 5 moves as before, so earliest turn 28 or 29.\n\nTurn 28 is possible as I thought earlier: move over 5 turns to arrive on turn 28.\n\nBut to be at (5,6) on turn 28, I need to start moving now.\n\nFor example, turn 24: move U to (4,3)\n\nTurn 25: move U to (4,4)\n\nTurn 26: move U to (4,5)  -- (4,5) is free? Let's assume for now.\n\nTurn 27: move R to (5,5)  -- from (4,5) to (5,5) right\n\nTurn 28: move U to (5,6) and eat.\n\nYes, this works.\n\n(5,5) on turn 27, then to (5,6) on turn 28.\n\nSimilarly, other paths.\n\nBut on turn 27 at (5,5), and (5,6) is above.\n\nNow, are there any issues with body or obstacles?\n\nFirst, on turn 24, move U to (4,3)\n\nThen positions: head (4,3), body (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) -- tail at (6,3)\n\n(4,3) is head, free.\n\nThen turn 25: move U to (4,4)\n\nHead to (4,4), body: (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), tail (6,3) removed, new tail (6,2)\n\n(4,4) should be free.\n\nTurn 26: move U to (4,5)\n\nHead to (4,5), body: (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) -- tail at (6,2)\n\n(4,5) free.\n\nTurn 27: move R to (5,5)\n\nFrom (4,5) to (5,5) right.\n\nHead to (5,5), body: (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) -- (6,2) removed? Body: previous head (4,5) to body, then (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), and tail (6,2) removed, new tail (6,1)\n\n(5,5) should be free.\n\nTurn 28: move U to (5,6) and eat.\n\nHead to (5,6), and since eat, tail does not move, so snake grows: new positions: head (5,6), then body: (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) -- length 8.\n\n(5,6) is food, eaten.\n\nNow, is (5,6) accessible? Earlier we said yes, from (5,5).\n\nBut is there an issue with the obstacle? (4,6) is obstacle, but (5,6) is fine.\n\nNow, during this path, I need to ensure no collision.\n\nFor example, on turn 26, at (4,5), is (4,5) under body? No, body is at lower y.\n\nSimilarly, all moves seem free.\n\nBut on turn 27, moving to (5,5), which should be free.\n\nNow, what about the food at (3,4)? I can eat it later, after turn 28.\n\nLife span 8, so after turn 28, life span decreases, but still available for several turns.\n\nAt turn 24, life span 8, after turn 24:7, ..., after turn 28:4, so still present.\n\nI can go to (3,4) from (5,6) or after.\n\nBut (3,4) is at (3,4), which is left and down.\n\nAfter eating at (5,6) on turn 28, head at (5,6), I can move down or left, etc.\n\nBut there might be a shorter path to (5,6).\n\nFor example, from (4,2), if I move R to (5,2) on turn 24.\n\nThen turn 25: must move U to (5,3) as only option.\n\nThen turn 26: from (5,3), I can move U to (5,4)\n\nTurn 27: U to (5,5)\n\nTurn 28: U to (5,6) and eat.\n\nSame as before, but I started with R instead of U.\n\nIn this case, on turn 24 move R to (5,2), then U to (5,3), U to (5,4), U to (5,5), U to (5,6).\n\nBut on turn 24 move R to (5,2), which is possible, and then U all the way.\n\nIn the first path, I went up to (4,5) then right to (5,5).\n\nBut in this path, I go right then up directly on x=5.\n\nWhich might be simpler.\n\nBut on turn 24, if I move R to (5,2), is it safe?\n\nEarlier, when I move to (5,2), the body is at (4,2), (4,1), etc., (5,2) is free, so ok.\n\nThen move U to (5,3), free.\n\nThen U to (5,4), should be free.\n\nU to (5,5), free.\n\nU to (5,6), eat.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but I have the food at (3,4) to consider later.\n\nAlso, the (1,6) is impossible, so ignore.\n\nNow, for turn 24, I have options.\n\nBut in the R then U path, I don't go near (3,4), so I can eat (3,4) after.\n\nSimilarly, in the U then U then R path, same.\n\nBut in the direct U path on x=5, it might be faster or same.\n\nNow, another thing: the internal obstacle at (4,6) doesn't affect since I'm going to (5,6) from (5,5).\n\nNow, about the tail danger: but no food on tail, so fine.\n\nNow, after eating (5,6) on turn 28, I can go to (3,4).\n\n(3,4) life span 8 at turn 24, on turn 28, after decreases: turn 24:8, after t24:7, t25:6, t26:5, t27:4, t28:3, so on turn 28, life span 3, present.\n\nAfter eating at (5,6) on turn 28, head at (5,6), I can move down to (5,5), but (5,5) was just visited, but in the move, when I eat, the body includes (5,5), so (5,5) is occupied.\n\nAfter eating at (5,6) on turn 28, positions: head (5,6), body (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), etc. as before.\n\nSo from (5,6), I can move D to (5,5) but occupied, or L to (4,6) but (4,6) obstacle, or R to (6,6), or U but y=6, U would be (5,7) which is wall, y=7 wall, so cannot.\n\nSo possible moves: only R to (6,6), since D to (5,5) occupied, L to (4,6) wall, U wall.\n\nSo must move R to (6,6) on turn 29.\n\nThen from (6,6), I can move D to (6,5), L to (5,6) but (5,6) is body now, occupied, or U wall, R wall (x=7), so only D to (6,5).\n\nThen to (6,4), etc., down to reach (3,4).\n\nBut (3,4) is at (3,4), so I need to go left and down.\n\nFrom (6,6) to (3,4): |6-3|=3 left, |6-4|=2 down, min 5 moves.\n\nBut life span of (3,4) on turn 28 is 3, so available on turn 28,29,30? After turn 28, life span decreases to 2? At turn 28, before decrease, life span 3, present; after turn 28, to 2; turn 29:2, after decrease to 1; turn 30:1, after decrease to 0, disappear after turn 30.\n\nSo can be eaten on turn 28,29,30.\n\nOn turn 28, I am at (5,6), not at (3,4).\n\nTurn 29: at (6,6) after moving R.\n\nTurn 30: from (6,6), move D to (6,5), for example.\n\nBut (3,4) is far; from (6,6) to (3,4) min 5 moves, so by turn 33 or something, too late, (3,4) gone by turn 30.\n\nSpecifically, to reach (3,4) on turn 30, I need to be there on turn 30.\n\nBut from turn 28 at (5,6), on turn 29 at (6,6), turn 30 at say (6,5), not close.\n\nMin moves to (3,4) from (5,6): |5-3|=2 left, |6-4|=2 down, min 4 moves.\n\nTurn 28: at (5,6)\n\nTurn 29: move to (6,6) or (5,5) but (5,5) occupied, so only (6,6)\n\nTurn 30: move to (6,5) or (5,6) occupied, so (6,5)\n\nTurn 31: to (6,4) or (5,5) occupied, so (6,4) or (7,5) wall, so (6,4)\n\nTurn 32: to (6,3) or (5,4), etc.\n\nNot reaching (3,4) soon.\n\nFrom (6,6) turn 29, I can move D to (6,5), then L to (5,5) but (5,5) occupied? On turn 29, after moving to (6,6), positions: head (6,6), body (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), etc., so (5,5) occupied.\n\nSo from (6,6), only D to (6,5)\n\nThen turn 30: at (6,5), can move D to (6,4), L to (5,5) occupied, R wall, U to (6,6) occupied, so only D to (6,4)\n\nTurn 31: at (6,4), can move D to (6,3), L to (5,4), U to (6,5) occupied.\n\n(5,4) might be free, etc.\n\nBut to go left, I need to move to (5,4) or something.\n\nBut (3,4) is at y=4, x=3.\n\nFrom (6,4) on turn 31, I can move L to (5,4), then to (4,4), to (3,4), but on turn 33 or later.\n\n(3,4) disappears after turn 30, so not available on turn 31.\n\nThus, if I go to (5,6) first, I miss (3,4).\n\nBut (3,4) is easier to get and has longer life, but I prioritized (5,6) because of shorter life.\n\nBut (5,6) life span 5, (3,4) life span 8, so (5,6) is more urgent.\n\nBut by going to (5,6), I lose (3,4).\n\nPerhaps I can eat (3,4) quickly before going to (5,6).\n\nBut earlier, if I eat (3,4) on turn 26, I cannot reach (5,6) by turn 28.\n\nUnless I eat (3,4) earlier.\n\nFrom current, can I eat (3,4) before turn 26?\n\nTurn 24: from (4,2), if I move L to (3,2), then turn 25: move U to (3,3), turn 26: move U to (3,4) eat.\n\nBut that's turn 26.\n\nCan I eat on turn 25? From (4,2), to (3,4) in one move? No, not adjacent.\n\nSo earliest eat (3,4) on turn 26.\n\nThen (5,6) on turn 28 not reachable.\n\nSo I have to choose one.\n\n(5,6) has value +1, (3,4) also +1, same value.\n\nBut (5,6) will disappear sooner, so better to eat it first, since (3,4) has longer life, I can eat it later if possible.\n\nBut after eating (5,6), I may not reach (3,4) in time.\n\nLife span of (3,4): at turn 24, life 8, so after turn 24:7, t25:6, t26:5, t27:4, t28:3, t29:2, t30:1, t31:0 disappear after t31.\n\nSo available until turn 31.\n\nAfter eating (5,6) on turn 28 at (5,6), I can go to (3,4).\n\nFrom (5,6) to (3,4): min 4 moves as before.\n\nTurn 28: at (5,6) after eating.\n\nTurn 29: move to (6,6) only, as above.\n\nTurn 30: to (6,5)\n\nTurn 31: to (6,4) or (5,5) occupied, so (6,4)\n\nTurn 32: to (6,3) or (5,4)\n\nBut (3,4) is at (3,4), from (6,4) I can move L to (5,4) on turn 32, then to (4,4) turn 33, to (3,4) turn 34, but (3,4) gone after turn 31, so not available on turn 34.\n\nOn turn 31, I am at (6,4), not at (3,4).\n\nTo reach (3,4) on turn 31, I need to be there on turn 31.\n\nFrom turn 28 at (5,6), with 3 moves (turn 29,30,31), I can move to cells within distance 3.\n\n(3,4) is |5-3| + |6-4| =2+2=4 >3, impossible to reach in 3 moves.\n\nSo I cannot eat (3,4) after (5,6); I must eat (3,4) first or not at all.\n\nBut if I eat (3,4) first, I miss (5,6).\n\nSo I can only eat one of them.\n\n(5,6) is farther but time-sensitive, (3,4) is closer but I can eat it later, but not if I go for (5,6).\n\nPerhaps I can eat (3,4) very quickly.\n\nBut I can't eat it before turn 26.\n\nAnother idea: from current position, I can go directly towards (5,6) but eat (3,4) on the way if possible, but (3,4) is not on the path.\n\nFor example, from (4,2), move U to (4,3), then on turn 25, instead of U, move L to (3,3), then turn 26 U to (3,4) eat, but then I am at (3,4) on turn 26, far from (5,6), and cannot reach by turn 28.\n\nThen (5,6) is lost.\n\nIf I go for (5,6) directly, I lose (3,4).\n\nBut (3,4) has longer life, so perhaps eat (3,4) first, and forget (5,6).\n\nBut (5,6) is also +1, same value.\n\nSince both have same value, and I can eat only one, I should choose the one that is safer or easier.\n\n(3,4) is closer and easier to eat, with no risk of missing.\n\n(5,6) requires going to the top with obstacle, and I might have space issues.\n\nFor example, after eating (5,6), I am stuck in the corner, as we saw, must move to (6,6), then down, and the body might block.\n\nWhereas (3,4) is more central.\n\nAlso, after eating (3,4), I can explore other areas.\n\nMoreover, there might be more food later, but currently only these.\n\nBut the problem is to maximize score, so eating one food is better than none, but I can eat both if possible, but it seems not.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (3,4) on turn 26, then since (5,6) is lost, I can go for other things, but no other food.\n\nOr I can plan to eat neither, but that seems worse.\n\nAnother thought: is there a way to eat (5,6) faster?\n\nFor example, if I move differently.\n\nSuppose on turn 24, I move R to (5,2)\n\nTurn 25: U to (5,3)\n\nTurn 26: U to (5,4)\n\nTurn 27: U to (5,5)\n\nTurn 28: U to (5,6) eat.\n\nSame as before.\n\nOr on turn 24 move U to (4,3)\n\nTurn 25 move R to (5,3)  -- from (4,3) to (5,3) right\n\nThen turn 26 U to (5,4)\n\nTurn 27 U to (5,5)\n\nTurn 28 U to (5,6) eat.\n\nBut on turn 25, if I move R to (5,3) from (4,3), is it possible?\n\nOn turn 24, after move U to (4,3), positions: head (4,3), body (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nThen turn 25 move R to (5,3): (5,3) is free? Yes, not occupied.\n\nThen head to (5,3), body: (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), tail (6,3) removed, new tail (6,2)\n\nThen turn 26 U to (5,4), etc.\n\nBut still, I eat on turn 28.\n\nAnd (3,4) is not eaten.\n\nSo I think I have to choose.\n\nNow, to decide, let's consider the board state.\n\nAfter eating (3,4), the snake grows, and I am at (3,4), which is left side.\n\nFrom there, I can move to (3,5), (2,4), (4,4), (3,3)\n\nThe area seems open.\n\nWhereas after eating (5,6), I am at top-right corner, and must move down the right wall, which might be risky with the body.\n\nFor example, after eating (5,6), length 8, body at (5,5), (4,5), etc., and I move to (6,6), then to (6,5), then to (6,4), and so on, down to y=1.\n\nBut at y=1, there is body, but it might clear.\n\nBut it could be tight.\n\nWhereas with (3,4), I have more space.\n\nAlso, (3,4) is closer, so I can eat it sooner, then have turns left to find other food or avoid risks.\n\nBut currently no other food, but food might spawn later? The state doesn't say, so probably only these foods.\n\nThe state gives current food, no mention of spawning, so only these three, but (1,6) impossible.\n\nSo only two possible foods.\n\nSince I can eat only one, I should eat (3,4) because it's safer and I can do it with fewer turns, leaving me in a better position.\n\nMoreover, with (5,6), there is the obstacle at (4,6), which might not be a problem, but it's there.\n\nAlso, in the path to (5,6), on turn 26 or 27, I am at (4,5) or (5,5), which are near the top, and if I have a long body, it might be ok.\n\nBut let's count the turns.\n\nIf I eat (3,4) on turn 26, then from turn 26 to later, I have time to move around.\n\nIf I eat (5,6) on turn 28, I have fewer turns.\n\nBut since no more food, score is same, but survival is key.\n\nThe goal is to maximize score by eating, but also long-term survival.\n\nBut with no food, I need to survive as long as possible, but eating food gives score.\n\nSince both give +1, same score if I eat one.\n\nBut perhaps eating (3,4) allows me to survive longer.\n\nLet's see the grid after actions.\n\nFirst, option 1: eat (3,4)\n\nTurn 24: move L to (3,2)\n\nThen positions: head (3,2), body (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) -- tail (5,3) removed, new tail (6,3)\n\nTurn 25: move U to (3,3)\n\nHead to (3,3), body: (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) -- tail (6,3) but after move, body: previous head (3,2) to body, then (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), and tail (5,3) already removed? In turn 24, after move to (3,2), tail is (6,3), as (5,3) removed.\n\nOn turn 25 move U to (3,3): head (3,3), body (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), tail (6,3) removed, new tail (6,2)\n\nTurn 26: move U to (3,4) and eat.\n\nHead (3,4), no tail move, so body: (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), and the tail from before is included, length 8.\n\nPositions: head (3,4), then (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) -- tail at (6,2)\n\nNow, from here, I can move to (3,5), (2,4), (4,4), (3,3) but (3,3) body.\n\nSo possible U to (3,5), L to (2,4), R to (4,4)\n\nAll should be free.\n\nThen I can explore.\n\nOption 2: go for (5,6)\n\nTurn 24: move U to (4,3)  -- or R, let's say U\n\nTurn 25: move U to (4,4)\n\nTurn 26: move U to (4,5)\n\nTurn 27: move R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 28: move U to (5,6) eat\n\nThen head at (5,6), body (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) -- from earlier, but after turn 27 at (5,5), body includes (4,5), (4,4), etc.\n\nAfter eating, positions: head (5,6), body (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) -- length 8.\n\nThen on turn 29, only move R to (6,6)\n\nTurn 30: move D to (6,5)\n\nTurn 31: move D to (6,4)\n\nAnd so on, down to the bottom.\n\nThe body is trailing, so when I move down, the tail moves, so cells free up, but I am confined to the right side.\n\nWhereas in the first option, I am at (3,4) with more freedom.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (4,6) is not blocking me in the first option.\n\nMoreover, in the second option, when I am at (4,5) on turn 26, for example, y=5, near the top, and if I have to move, but it's ok.\n\nBut the corner at (6,6) might be risky if the body blocks.\n\nFor example, on turn 30 at (6,5), I can only move down to (6,4), then to (6,3), which is occupied? At some point, (6,3) might be body, but as I move, it clears.\n\nBut it might be manageable.\n\nHowever, since both options give the same score, and eating (3,4) is sooner and safer, I think it's better to eat (3,4).\n\nAdditionally, in the state, there is food at (1,6) but impossible, so only these.\n\nSo I will go for (3,4).\n\nThus for turn 24, move L to (3,2).\n\nThen turn 25: move U to (3,3)\n\nTurn 26: move U to (3,4) eat.\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead? \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but output format is to specify actions for turns starting from t1.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, etc.\n\nBut how many turns to output? It says \"...\" so probably until I have a plan or for several turns.\n\nSince I have a clear plan, I can output up to turn 26 or more.\n\nBut after eating, I need to move around.\n\nSince the immediate goal is to eat (3,4), I can output those moves.\n\nThen after that, I can decide based on situation.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to provide actions for t1=24, 25, 26, etc.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns: to turn 28.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFirst, on turn 24, move L to (3,2)\n\nTurn 25, move U to (3,3)\n\nTurn 26, move U to (3,4) and eat.\n\nThen on turn 27, from (3,4), I can move, say, U to (3,5) or R to (4,4), etc.\n\nTo have a plan, suppose I move R to (4,4) on turn 27.\n\nThen turn 28, to (5,4) or something.\n\nBut not necessary.\n\nSince the food at (5,6) will disappear, but I can't reach it, so ignore.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) gone.\n\nSo after turn 26, I need to survive.\n\nBut for the answer, I can provide actions for turns 24 to 28.\n\nBut on turn 27 and 28, it depends.\n\nPerhaps I can output the critical moves.\n\nSince the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output the actions.\n\nI think for simplicity, I'll output the moves to eat (3,4) and then some conservative moves.\n\nBut let's define.\n\nAnother thing: when I eat at (3,4) on turn 26, the snake grows, so positions change.\n\nBut for now.\n\nI think for turn 24, move L.\n\nThen for subsequent turns.\n\nIn the move to (3,2), is there any risk?\n\n(3,2) is free, no wall, no body.\n\nThen to (3,3), free.\n\nThen to (3,4), food.\n\nAll safe.\n\nAfter that, from (3,4), I can move to (4,4) on turn 27, for example.\n\n(4,4) should be free.\n\nThen on turn 28, to (4,5) or (5,4), etc.\n\nBut let's not specify, or I can.\n\nTo avoid the top right, I can move down or left.\n\nFor example, on turn 27, move D to (3,3) but (3,3) is body, occupied, so cannot.\n\nFrom (3,4), after eating, body includes (3,3), so adjacent cells: (3,5), (2,4), (4,4), (3,3) occupied.\n\nSo can move U to (3,5), L to (2,4), R to (4,4).\n\nSay I move R to (4,4) on turn 27.\n\nThen turn 28, from (4,4), can move U to (4,5), D to (4,3), L to (3,4) occupied, R to (5,4), etc.\n\nBut since no food, I can move safely.\n\nSimilarly, I think it's fine.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 24):**\n- **Grid Size**: 8x8, with playable area from (1,1) to (6,6). Walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacle at (4,6).\n- **Snake**: Head at (4,2) moving Up (U). Body segments: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3). Length 7.\n- **Food**:\n  - (1,6): Value +1, life span 2 (disappears after turn 25).\n  - (5,6): Value +1, life span 5 (disappears after turn 28).\n  - (3,4): Value +1, life span 8 (disappears after turn 31).\n- **Constraints**: Cannot move opposite to current direction (Down is forbidden this turn). Must avoid walls, obstacles, and body collisions. Tail at (5,3) has no food, so no tail reward danger.\n\n**Key Decisions (5+ Turns Ahead):**\n1. **Food Prioritization**:\n   - (1,6): Manhattan distance from head (4,2) is |4-1| + |2-6| = 7 moves. With life span 2, it disappears after turn 25 and is unreachable. Ignore.\n   - (5,6): Distance |4-5| + |2-6| = 5 moves. Life span 5 allows eating by turn 28. Path: e.g., (4,2) → (4,3) → (4,4) → (4,5) → (5,5) → (5,6) eat on turn 28.\n   - (3,4): Distance |4-3| + |2-4| = 3 moves. Life span 8 allows eating by turn 26. Path: (4,2) → (3,2) → (3,3) → (3,4) eat on turn 26.\n   - Conflict: Eating (3,4) on turn 26 makes (5,6) unreachable by turn 28 due to distance (min 4 moves from (3,4) to (5,6), but only 2 turns left). Similarly, eating (5,6) first makes (3,4) unreachable by turn 31. Only one food can be eaten.\n   - **Choice**: Prioritize (3,4) because:\n     - Closer (eaten on turn 26 vs. turn 28 for (5,6)).\n     - Safer path: Central location avoids top-right corner risks (e.g., dead end near (6,6) after eating (5,6)).\n     - Same value (+1), but eating sooner allows more flexibility for long-term survival.\n     - After eating (5,6), movement is restricted to the right wall, increasing collision risk with the growing body. (3,4) leaves the snake in an open area.\n\n2. **Path to (3,4) and Survival**:\n   - Turn 24: Move Left (L) to (3,2). Valid (not reverse, no collision).\n   - Turn 25: Move Up (U) to (3,3). Valid (direction now Left, so Up allowed).\n   - Turn 26: Move Up (U) to (3,4) and eat. Snake grows to length 8.\n   - After eating, the snake is at (3,4) with body trailing. To maximize survival:\n     - Avoid top-right area (near (5,6)) as it has limited space and the obstacle at (4,6).\n     - Move towards open areas (e.g., left or down) to prevent trapping.\n   - Turns 27-28: Move Right to (4,4) on turn 27 (central, safer), then Up to (4,5) on turn 28 (away from body, toward open space). Both moves are low-risk.\n\n3. **Risk Avoidance**:\n   - **Body Collisions**: All moves checked for 5+ turns; no body or wall issues. Tail has no food, so no tail reward danger.\n   - **Life Span**: (5,6) is skipped to avoid unnecessary risk. (3,4) is eaten with margin before expiration.\n   - **Long-Term Survival**: After turn 28, the snake can explore left/down (e.g., (2,4), (3,5)) to stay in open areas, but detailed moves beyond turn 28 are not critical for this plan.\n\n**Action Plan (Turns 24 to 28):**\n- Turn 24: Move L (Left) to (3,2) – Start path to (3,4).\n- Turn 25: Move U (Up) to (3,3) – Continue to food.\n- Turn 26: Move U (Up) to (3,4) – Eat food, grow to length 8.\n- Turn 27: Move R (Right) to (4,4) – Move to central cell for flexibility.\n- Turn 28: Move U (Up) to (4,5) – Avoid bottom-left body segments; position for future exploration.\n\n**Why this maximizes score and survival:**\n- Eats one +1 food (score +1) safely, ignoring unreachable/risky food.\n- Path avoids walls, obstacles, and body collisions.\n- After eating, moves to open areas reduce trapping risk for long-term survival.\n- Thinking ahead: By turn 28, the snake is at (4,5) with options to move U/D/L/R (e.g., to (4,6) but (4,6) is obstacle, so (5,5), (3,5), or (4,4) if needed).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 24: L (left)  \nTurn 25: U (up)  \nTurn 26: U (up)  \nTurn 27: R (right)  \nTurn 28: U (up)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 25, and I'm the snake AI. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and one internal obstacle at (4,6). So the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are on the borders, meaning I can't go to those cells.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (3,2), then body segments: (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). Head direction is left (L), so it was moving left to (3,2) from previous position.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (1,6) with value 1, life span 1 (so it disappears after this turn if not eaten)\n\n- (5,6) with value 1, life span 4\n\n- (3,4) with value 1, life span 7\n\n- (3,1) with value 1, life span 10\n\nAll food has value 1, meaning they are all positive food since value is +1. No negative food here.\n\nNow, I need to plan at least 5 turns ahead, prioritizing long-term survival over immediate rewards. Also, I must avoid risks like collisions or getting trapped.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls on all borders, so playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? No, borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (4,6), so that cell is blocked.\n\nPlayable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (4,6) is blocked.\n\nNow snake positions:\n\n- Head: (3,2)\n\n- Body: (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nSo the snake has 7 segments. Head at (3,2), next is (4,2), which is right of head? Head is at (3,2), and since direction is left, it came from right, so previous head position was (4,2), I think? Snake positions are listed as [(3,2), (4,2), (4,1), ...], so head is first: (3,2), then the segment that was head before is (4,2), then (4,1), etc.\n\nSince head direction is L, it moved left to (3,2) from (4,2).\n\nNow, possible moves from current position (3,2) with head direction L.\n\nSince no instant reverse, I cannot move right (opposite to left), so possible moves: up (U), down (D), left (L), but left might not be possible if wall or body.\n\nCheck adjacent cells:\n\n- Left (L): (2,2) - is this within bounds? x=2, y=2, since walls are x=0 and x=7, y=0 and y=7, so (2,2) is playable. Is it occupied? Snake body: positions are (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). So (2,2) is not in body, so should be free.\n\n- Up (U): (3,3) - y=3, x=3. Playable? y=3 between 1-6, x=3, fine. Occupied? Snake has (3,2), (4,2), etc., no (3,3), so free.\n\n- Down (D): (3,1) - y=1, x=3. Playable? y=1, but y=0 is wall, so y=1 is bottom row, should be playable. Walls are at y=0, so y=1 to y=6 are playable, I think. Similarly, x=0 and x=7 walls, so x=1 to x=6 playable except obstacles.\n\n(3,1) is in snake positions? Snake has (4,1) and (5,1), but (3,1)? Positions: (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). So (3,1) is not listed, but (4,1) is there. (3,1) should be free unless wall or something. But y=1 is playable, and no body there.\n\n(3,1) has food! Food at (3,1) with life span 10. But I'll get to that.\n\nAlso, right (R) is not possible because it's reverse direction, since current head direction is L, so moving right would be opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo from (3,2), possible actions: U, D, L.\n\nNow, L to (2,2), U to (3,3), D to (3,1).\n\n(3,1) has food: (3,1) is a food position with value 1, life span 10.\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, other foods: (1,6) life span 1, so it will disappear after this turn if not eaten now.\n\n(5,6) life span 4, (3,4) life span 7, (3,1) life span 10.\n\nSince (1,6) has only this turn to be eaten, I should consider if I can eat it.\n\nBut (1,6) is far away. I'm at (3,2), (1,6) is left and up. Distance: from (3,2) to (1,6) is |3-1|=2 in x, |2-6|=4 in y, so at least 6 moves away, but I can't reach it in one turn, and it disappears after this turn, so I cannot eat it. After turn 25, if not eaten, it disappears. So on turn 25, I can move, but I'm not at (1,6), so I can't eat it this turn. Therefore, (1,6) will disappear after this turn and is not reachable, so I should ignore it.\n\nSimilarly, other foods.\n\nNow, (3,1) is directly below me at (3,2), so moving down to (3,1) would eat that food.\n\nBut I need to consider the risks.\n\nFirst, what happens if I eat (3,1)? It's positive food, so snake length increases by one. After eating, the head moves to (3,1), and since it's food, a new segment is added, so the tail doesn't move. But the tail is at (6,3) currently.\n\nSnake positions: head (3,2), then (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). So tail is (6,3).\n\nIf I move down to (3,1), which is food, so head moves to (3,1), new segment added, so the snake becomes: head (3,1), then previous head (3,2) becomes second segment, then (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), and new tail? When eating, the tail stays, so the snake grows by one segment.\n\nAfter move: head moves to new position, if food, tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n\nSo positions: new head at (3,1), then (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). (4,1) is already a segment, but now (3,1) is head, (3,2) is next, then (4,2), then (4,1), etc.\n\nList: before move: segments: 0:(3,2), 1:(4,2), 2:(4,1), 3:(5,1), 4:(6,1), 5:(6,2), 6:(6,3) tail.\n\nAfter moving down to (3,1) and eating food: head moves to (3,1), so new position: head (3,1), then previous segments: (3,2) becomes segment 1, then (4,2) segment 2, (4,1) segment 3, (5,1) segment 4, (6,1) segment 5, (6,2) segment 6, and (6,3) segment 7 (tail), but since food eaten, tail doesn't move, so we add a new segment? No: when head eats food, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail remains in place, so the body grows by one cell at the tail.\n\nStandard snake: when head moves to a cell with food, it consumes it, and the tail does not advance that turn, so the snake grows by one segment.\n\nSo in terms of positions: the new head position is the food cell, and the body segments shift, but the tail stays, so the last segment is duplicated or something.\n\nInitial positions: S0 (head), S1, S2, ..., Stail.\n\nAfter moving to a new cell without food: new head, S0 becomes S1, S1 becomes S2, ..., Stail is removed, new tail is the previous second last.\n\nBut with food: new head, S0 becomes S1, S1 becomes S2, ..., Stail remains, so Stail is still there, and we have an extra segment.\n\nSo for this case:\n\nBefore move: positions: H: (3,2), B1: (4,2), B2: (4,1), B3: (5,1), B4: (6,1), B5: (6,2), tail: (6,3)\n\nAfter moving down to (3,1) which is food: new head at (3,1), then the first body segment is the old head (3,2), then B1: (4,2), B2: (4,1), B3: (5,1), B4: (6,1), B5: (6,2), and tail remains (6,3), but since we add a segment, the tail is still (6,3), and we have one more segment.\n\nThe body segments are: new B1: old head (3,2), new B2: old B1 (4,2), new B3: old B2 (4,1), new B4: old B3 (5,1), new B5: old B4 (6,1), new B6: old B5 (6,2), and new tail: old tail (6,3). So now snake has 8 segments: head (3,1), then (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3).\n\n(4,1) is still there, but now it's B3.\n\nNow, the food at (3,1) is eaten, so it's removed.\n\nBut in this position, after moving down, head is at (3,1), and the segment above is (3,2), so if I move up later, I might collide, but not immediately.\n\nNow, back to choices at turn 25.\n\nI can move L to (2,2), U to (3,3), or D to (3,1).\n\n(3,1) has food, so moving D gives immediate reward.\n\nBut there's a risk: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\nIn this case, is the head adjacent to tail? Current head (3,2), tail is (6,3). Distance: |3-6|=3 in x, |2-3|=1 in y, so not adjacent. Adjacent would be sharing a side, like (x,y) and (x±1,y) or (x,y±1).\n\n(3,2) and (6,3) are not adjacent; they are diagonally apart or farther. So no danger here.\n\nMoreover, the food is at (3,1), not on the tail.\n\nSo moving D to (3,1) seems safe and gets food.\n\nBut let's think long-term.\n\nAfter eating (3,1), head at (3,1), direction would be down (since moved down).\n\nThen possible moves from (3,1): U, D, L, R, but since direction is D, no instant reverse to U, so cannot move up immediately.\n\nPossible: D to (3,0), but y=0 is wall, so cannot move down.\n\nL to (2,1), R to (4,1), but (4,1) is a body segment? After move, positions: head (3,1), body (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). So (4,1) is a body segment, so moving to (4,1) would be body collision.\n\nSimilarly, (3,0) is wall.\n\nSo from (3,1), with direction down, possible moves: L to (2,1) or R to (4,1), but (4,1) is occupied, so only L to (2,1) is possible? U is reverse, not allowed.\n\nDirection is down, so moving up is reverse, not allowed.\n\nMoving left: (2,1), moving right: (4,1), but (4,1) is body, so collision if I move there.\n\nSo only possible move is L to (2,1), which should be free.\n\n(2,1): is it occupied? Snake has (3,1) head, (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), etc., no (2,1), and not wall, so yes, can move left to (2,1).\n\nAfter that, head at (2,1), direction left.\n\nThen from there, I need to plan.\n\nBut let's not get ahead; I need to think multiple options.\n\nIf I move down to (3,1) now, I get food, but then I'm at (3,1) with limited moves, only left to (2,1).\n\nIf I don't move down, I have other choices.\n\nFor example, move left to (2,2).\n\nFrom (3,2) move L to (2,2).\n\nThen head at (2,2), direction left.\n\nPossible moves: from (2,2), with direction L, cannot move R (reverse).\n\nU to (2,3), D to (2,1), L to (1,2).\n\nAll should be free now.\n\n(2,3): not occupied, (2,1) not occupied, (1,2) not occupied.\n\nThen I can go to other areas.\n\nMove up to (3,3).\n\nFrom (3,2) move U to (3,3).\n\nHead at (3,3), direction up.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (3,4), D to (3,2) but (3,2) is now body, so cannot move down? After move, snake positions: head (3,3), then body (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). So (3,2) is body segment, so moving down to (3,2) would be collision.\n\nL to (2,3), R to (4,3).\n\n(4,3) might be free or not.\n\n(4,3): not in snake positions, not wall, so free.\n\nSimilarly (2,3) free.\n\nU to (3,4): (3,4) has food! Food at (3,4) with life span 7.\n\nSo moving up could be good to get that food later.\n\nBut not immediately.\n\nNow, back to turn 25 decision.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nAlso, the food at (3,1) has life span 10, so it will be there for a while, I don't need to eat it immediately.\n\nBut if I don't eat it now, and I move away, it might be under the body, but I can eat it later when body moves.\n\n\"Food can spawn under snake body but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\"\n\nCurrently, (3,1) is not under body; it's free, with food.\n\nIf I don't eat it now, and I move, say, left or up, then later the snake body might cover it or not.\n\nFor example, if I move left to (2,2), then positions: head (2,2), body (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), etc. (3,1) is still there with food, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, if I move up, (3,1) is free.\n\nBut when I move, the body shifts.\n\nAfter any move, the body moves.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nAt turn 25, before move, positions as given.\n\nIf I move down to (3,1), eat food, grow, as above.\n\nIf I move left to (2,2), no food, so head moves to (2,2), then body: old head (3,2) becomes first body, old B1 (4,2) becomes next, etc., and tail (6,3) is removed? No food, so tail moves.\n\nAfter moving to (2,2) no food: new head (2,2), then B1: old head (3,2), B2: old B1 (4,2), B3: old B2 (4,1), B4: old B3 (5,1), B5: old B4 (6,1), B6: old B5 (6,2), and tail is old B6 (6,3)? Old positions: index 0: (3,2) head, 1: (4,2), 2: (4,1), 3: (5,1), 4: (6,1), 5: (6,2), 6: (6,3) tail.\n\nAfter move left to (2,2) no food: new head (2,2), then new B1: old head (3,2), new B2: old B1 (4,2), new B3: old B2 (4,1), new B4: old B3 (5,1), new B5: old B4 (6,1), new B6: old B5 (6,2), and tail is new B6, so (6,2)? Old B6 is (6,3), but since no food, the tail is removed, so the new body is up to new B5: (6,1)? Let's list new segments:\n\n- Head: (2,2)\n\n- Body1: previous head (3,2)\n\n- Body2: previous B1 (4,2)\n\n- Body3: previous B2 (4,1)\n\n- Body4: previous B3 (5,1)\n\n- Body5: previous B4 (6,1)\n\n- Body6: previous B5 (6,2)  // since tail was (6,3), but it moves, so previous B5 (6,2) becomes the new tail? Positions: the new body segments are the previous positions except the tail is removed.\n\nAfter moving without eating: the new head position is the move-to cell, then each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail segment is removed.\n\nSo for indices: new position i is old position i-1 for i>=1, with new head at new position.\n\nOld: pos0: (3,2), pos1: (4,2), pos2: (4,1), pos3: (5,1), pos4: (6,1), pos5: (6,2), pos6: (6,3)\n\nAfter move to (2,2) no food: new pos0: (2,2) head\n\nnew pos1: old pos0 (3,2)\n\nnew pos2: old pos1 (4,2)\n\nnew pos3: old pos2 (4,1)\n\nnew pos4: old pos3 (5,1)\n\nnew pos5: old pos4 (6,1)  // since old pos4 was (6,1)\n\nnew pos6: old pos5 (6,2)  // and old pos6 (6,3) is removed\n\nSo tail is at (6,2), and (6,3) is now empty.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) is still there with food, not occupied.\n\nIf I move up to (3,3), similar thing.\n\nNow, back to long-term planning.\n\nI have food at (3,4), (5,6), and (3,1) with various life spans.\n\n(3,4) life span 7, so it will disappear after turn 25 + 7 = turn 32? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 25, life span is 7, so after 7 more turns, it disappears. Turn 25: life span 7, after turn 25, it becomes 6, then turn 26:5, ..., at turn 31: life span 1, after turn 31 it becomes 0 and disappears, so last chance to eat is turn 31.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) life span 4 at turn 25, so disappears after turn 28 (turn 25:4, t26:3, t27:2, t28:1, after t28:0 gone, so last eat turn 28).\n\n(3,1) life span 10, last eat turn 34.\n\nAlso, internal obstacle at (4,6), so I need to avoid that.\n\nNow, the snake is currently in the bottom-left area.\n\nHead at (3,2), with body extending to (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), so the right and bottom are somewhat blocked.\n\nIf I move down to (3,1), I eat food but then I'm at (3,1) with only left move possible to (2,1), as we saw.\n\nThen from (2,1), I can go to (2,2), (1,1), etc., but (1,1) is corner, might be risky.\n\n(2,1) to (1,1) or (2,0) but y=0 wall, so only (1,1) or (2,2) or (3,1) but (3,1) is body after move.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nIf at turn 25 I move D to (3,1), eat food, head at (3,1), direction D.\n\nPositions: head (3,1), body (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)  // 8 segments\n\nNow turn 26, from (3,1), possible moves: U not allowed (reverse), D to (3,0) wall, L to (2,1) free, R to (4,1) but (4,1) is body, collision. So only L to (2,1).\n\nMove L to (2,1), no food there, so head to (2,1), body moves: new head (2,1), body: (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), and tail (6,3) removed? With growth, it's longer.\n\nAfter eating at turn 25, snake has 8 segments.\n\nTurn 26, move to (2,1) no food: new head (2,1), then body: old head (3,1) becomes B1, then (3,2) B2, (4,2) B3, (4,1) B4, (5,1) B5, (6,1) B6, (6,2) B7, and tail (6,3) removed, so new tail at (6,2)? Positions:\n\nOld: pos0: (3,1) head, pos1: (3,2), pos2: (4,2), pos3: (4,1), pos4: (5,1), pos5: (6,1), pos6: (6,2), pos7: (6,3) tail\n\nAfter move to (2,1) no food: new pos0: (2,1) head\n\nnew pos1: old pos0 (3,1)\n\nnew pos2: old pos1 (3,2)\n\nnew pos3: old pos2 (4,2)\n\nnew pos4: old pos3 (4,1)\n\nnew pos5: old pos4 (5,1)\n\nnew pos6: old pos5 (6,1)\n\nnew pos7: old pos6 (6,2)  // old pos7 (6,3) removed\n\nSo tail at (6,2)\n\nNow head at (2,1), direction L (since moved left).\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,2), D to (2,0) wall, L to (1,1), R to (3,1) but (3,1) is now body (pos1), collision, so only U or L.\n\nU to (2,2) or L to (1,1).\n\n(2,2) might be free, (1,1) free.\n\nBut (2,2) is close to body? Body has (3,1), (3,2), etc., (2,2) should be free.\n\nFrom there, I can go to (2,3) or (1,2), etc.\n\nBut I'm in the bottom-left corner, which might be cramped with the long snake.\n\nIf I don't eat (3,1) now, I can move left or up to explore.\n\nFor example, move left to (2,2) at turn 25.\n\nThen head at (2,2), direction L.\n\nPositions: new head (2,2), body (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), tail (6,3) removed? No food, so tail moves.\n\nOld: pos0 (3,2), pos1 (4,2), pos2 (4,1), pos3 (5,1), pos4 (6,1), pos5 (6,2), pos6 (6,3)\n\nAfter move to (2,2): new pos0 (2,2), pos1 (3,2), pos2 (4,2), pos3 (4,1), pos4 (5,1), pos5 (6,1), pos6 (6,2)  // tail at (6,2)\n\nNow (3,1) is still there with food, and it's free.\n\nFrom (2,2), I can move U to (2,3), D to (2,1), or L to (1,2).\n\n(2,1) has no food, but I can go there.\n\nOr I can move towards (3,4) food.\n\n(3,4) is above.\n\nMove up to (3,3) at turn 25.\n\nFrom (3,2) move U to (3,3), no food? (3,3) has no food, foods are at (1,6), (5,6), (3,4), (3,1), so (3,3) is empty.\n\nSo move U to (3,3), head at (3,3), direction U.\n\nPositions: new head (3,3), body (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), tail (6,3) removed? No food, so tail moves.\n\nOld: pos0 (3,2), pos1 (4,2), pos2 (4,1), pos3 (5,1), pos4 (6,1), pos5 (6,2), pos6 (6,3)\n\nAfter move: new pos0 (3,3), pos1 (3,2), pos2 (4,2), pos3 (4,1), pos4 (5,1), pos5 (6,1), pos6 (6,2)  // tail at (6,2)\n\n(3,1) food still there.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can move U to (3,4) which has food, life span 7.\n\nSo on turn 25, if I move U to (3,3), then on turn 26, I can move U to (3,4) to eat that food.\n\nThat might be better.\n\nLet's compare options.\n\nOption 1: Move D to (3,1) at turn 25, eat food, then to (2,1) at turn 26, then I can go up or left.\n\nBut after eating (3,1), I'm at (3,1) with only left move, to (2,1), then from (2,1) I can go to (2,2) or (1,1).\n\nIf I go to (2,2), then I can go up to (2,3), etc.\n\nBut the snake is long, and the bottom area might be tight.\n\nOption 2: Move L to (2,2) at turn 25, then I can go to (2,3) or (1,2) or back, but back might be body.\n\nFrom (2,2), move U to (2,3) or L to (1,2), etc.\n\nThen I can go towards (3,4).\n\nOption 3: Move U to (3,3) at turn 25, then on turn 26 move U to (3,4) to eat food there.\n\nThis seems efficient for getting (3,4) food.\n\n(3,4) life span 7, so I have time, but getting it early is good.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) is another food.\n\nBut (5,6) is near the obstacle.\n\nLet's plan a path.\n\nFirst, prioritize survival. The bottom-left has walls, and snake body, so moving down to (3,1) might trap me.\n\nFor example, after moving D to (3,1) and then L to (2,1), I'm at (2,1) with body at (3,1), (3,2), etc.\n\nPossible moves from (2,1): U to (2,2), L to (1,1), R to (3,1) but occupied, D wall.\n\nSo U or L.\n\nIf I go L to (1,1), then corner: from (1,1), can go U to (1,2) or R to (2,1) but occupied, D wall, L wall (x=0), so only U to (1,2).\n\nThen from (1,2), can go U to (1,3), R to (2,2), etc.\n\nBut it's a narrow path, and with long snake, I might have issues later.\n\nIf from (2,1) I go U to (2,2), then from (2,2) can go U to (2,3), L to (1,2), R to (3,2) but (3,2) is body, etc.\n\nStill, it might be okay, but let's see the grid.\n\nThe top-right has food at (5,6), and (3,4) is middle-top.\n\n(3,4) is at y=4, x=3.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), so above that.\n\nTo get to (5,6), I need to go to x=5,y=6.\n\nFrom current position, it's a bit far.\n\nBut life span 4, so I need to reach it by turn 28.\n\nTurn 25 now, so 3 turns to get there? Distance from (3,2) to (5,6) is |3-5|=2, |2-6|=4, min moves 6, but I can't reach in 3 turns. At turn 25, I can move, turn 26,27,28. 4 moves including turn 25? Turn 25: move, turn 26,27,28, so 4 moves possible.\n\nFrom (3,2) to (5,6): dx=2, dy=4, min moves 6, which is more than 4, so I cannot reach (5,6) by turn 28 if I start from here, because after 4 moves, best I can be is, say, (5,4) or something, not (5,6).\n\nFor example, move right, but I can't move right from (3,2) because direction L, reverse not allowed. From (3,2) I can only U,D,L.\n\nIf I move U to (3,3), then from there I can move R to (4,3) or U to (3,4), etc.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (5,6): dx=2, dy=3, min 5 moves, but I have only 3 moves after turn 25? Turn 25 to turn 28 is turns 25,26,27,28: 4 actions.\n\nTurn 25: from (3,2) to (3,3)\n\nTurn 26: from (3,3) to (3,4) or (4,3), etc.\n\nIf to (3,4), then turn 27 to (3,5) or (4,4), etc., turn 28 to (4,5) or (3,6), etc. (5,6) is at x=5,y=6.\n\nFrom (3,4) to (5,6): dx=2, dy=2, min 4 moves, but I need to be there on turn 28 to eat before it disappears.\n\nIf on turn 26 I am at (3,4), then turn 27 to (4,4) or (3,5), turn 28 to (5,4) or (4,5) or (3,6), not (5,6). To reach (5,6) from (3,4) in two moves: possible if move right then up, but (4,4) to (5,4) to (5,5) not (5,6). From (3,4) move R to (4,4), then U to (4,5), then need another move to (4,6) or (5,5), but (4,6) is obstacle, so cannot. From (4,4) move R to (5,4), then U to (5,5), then U to (5,6) on turn 29, but turn 28 is last chance, turn 28: if I am at (5,6) on turn 28, I can eat.\n\nBut from (3,4) on turn 26, to (5,6) on turn 28: that's two moves, but |dx=2, dy=2|, min moves 4? No, min moves is max(dx,dy) for grid, since diagonal not allowed, so to change x by 2 and y by 2, I need at least 4 moves if I move one step at a time.\n\nFor example, from (3,4) to (5,6): I need to increase x by 2 and y by 2, so minimum 4 moves: e.g., (3,4) -> (4,4) -> (4,5) -> (5,5) -> (5,6). Or (3,4) -> (3,5) -> (4,5) -> (4,6) but (4,6) obstacle, so not possible. Or (3,4) -> (4,4) -> (5,4) -> (5,5) -> (5,6). So 4 moves required.\n\nBut from turn 26 at (3,4), turn 27: move to (4,4) or (3,5), turn 28: if to (4,4), then to (5,4) or (4,5), not (5,6). On turn 28, I can be at (4,5) or (5,5), not (5,6). (5,6) requires turn 29.\n\nBut life span: at turn 25, life span 4, so at turn 26:3, turn27:2, turn28:1, after turn28 it disappears, so must eat on or before turn28. So on turn28, I need to be at (5,6) to eat.\n\nBut from (3,4) on turn26, I cannot reach (5,6) by turn28 with only two moves; I need three moves, so impossible to eat (5,6) if I am not closer.\n\nSimilarly, from current position (3,2), to (5,6) min moves 6, turn25 to turn28 is 4 moves, so I cannot reach (5,6) in time. Therefore, I should forget about (5,6) food; it's not reachable before it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) is gone this turn.\n\nSo only foods to consider are (3,4) and (3,1).\n\n(3,4) life span 7, last eat turn31.\n\n(3,1) life span 10, last eat turn34.\n\nNow, (3,4) is more urgent, but I have time.\n\nTo maximize score, I should eat both if possible.\n\nAlso, survival is key.\n\nNow, if I move up to (3,3) on turn25, then on turn26 I can move to (3,4) to eat it.\n\nThat gets me one food quickly.\n\nThen from (3,4), I can explore.\n\nIf I move down to (3,1), I eat that food, but then I'm in a corner.\n\nSo moving up seems better for long-term.\n\nBut let's see the position after moving up.\n\nTurn25: move U to (3,3), no food, so positions: head (3,3), body (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)  // tail at (6,2)\n\n(3,1) food still there.\n\nTurn26: from (3,3), I can move U to (3,4) to eat food, since (3,4) has food.\n\nMove U to (3,4), eat, so head to (3,4), grow.\n\nNew positions: head (3,4), body (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) and since ate food, tail stays, so add old tail? After move with food: new head (3,4), body: old head (3,3) becomes B1, old B1 (3,2) becomes B2, etc., and tail remains.\n\nOld positions before move turn26: head (3,3), B1 (3,2), B2 (4,2), B3 (4,1), B4 (5,1), B5 (6,1), B6 (6,2) tail\n\nAfter move to (3,4) with food: new head (3,4), B1: old head (3,3), B2: old B1 (3,2), B3: old B2 (4,2), B4: old B3 (4,1), B5: old B4 (5,1), B6: old B5 (6,1), B7: old B6 (6,2)  // tail at (6,2)\n\nSo now snake longer, head at (3,4).\n\nDirection up.\n\nThen from here, I can move to other areas.\n\nFor example, move L to (2,4), R to (4,4), U to (3,5), D not allowed (reverse).\n\n(3,5) is free, (2,4) free, (4,4) free.\n\n(4,4) is near the obstacle but not blocked.\n\nI can go towards the center or top.\n\n(3,1) food is still there, life span 10, so I can eat it later when I come back.\n\nBut to eat it, I need to have the head there when it's free.\n\nCurrently, after turn26, (3,1) is not occupied; it has food, and body is at (4,1), (5,1), etc., but (3,1) is free.\n\nAs the snake moves, the body might cover it or not.\n\nBut I can plan to eat it later.\n\nNow, back to turn25, if I move left to (2,2), then from there I can go to (2,3) or (1,2), then to (1,3), etc., but it might take longer to reach (3,4).\n\nFor example, turn25 move L to (2,2), then turn26 move U to (2,3), turn27 move U to (2,4), turn28 move R to (3,4) to eat, but (3,4) might be eaten earlier if I go directly, but in this case, I eat on turn28, which is fine since life span 7, last turn 31.\n\nBut with the first approach, I eat on turn26, better.\n\nSimilarly, if I move down to (3,1) on turn25, I eat (3,1), then turn26 to (2,1), then I need to go up, e.g. to (2,2) on turn27, then (2,3) turn28, then (3,3) turn29, then (3,4) turn30, to eat (3,4) on turn30, still before turn31.\n\nBut I ate (3,1) early, but I might be in a worse position.\n\nIn terms of score, eating both is good, but survival first.\n\nNow, after eating (3,4) early, I have more space to move.\n\nFor example, from (3,4) after eating, I can move to (3,5) or (4,4), etc.\n\nThen I can go to the right side where there is space.\n\nCurrently, the snake body is mostly on the bottom and right, but after moving up, the tail is at (6,2), so the bottom-right is clearing.\n\nIn the up move scenario, after turn26, tail at (6,2), and as I move, the tail moves away, so the grid opens up.\n\n(3,1) food can be eaten later by moving down when possible.\n\nBut to eat (3,1), I need to have head there.\n\nFor example, from (3,4), if I move down, but direction is up, so I need to change direction.\n\nBut after moving to (3,4), direction up, so I can move L, R, U, not D.\n\nIf I move D, it would be reverse, not allowed immediately.\n\nSo from (3,4), I can only move U, L, R.\n\nNot down, so I cannot go directly to (3,1) soon.\n\nI need to maneuver.\n\nBut since (3,1) has long life span, I can come back later.\n\nSimilarly, there might be other foods spawning, but not mentioned, so only these for now.\n\nBut to maximize, I should eat (3,4) first since it's closer and I can get it quickly.\n\nThen I have a longer snake, but more score.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nThe format is to output actions from turn t1 onwards.\n\nt1=25, so I need to specify actions for turn 25,26,27, etc., at least 5 turns.\n\nBut I need to decide the sequence.\n\nSince the future depends on moves, I should plan a path.\n\nLet me outline a plan.\n\nFirst, at turn 25, move up to (3,3). This avoids the corner and positions me to eat (3,4) next.\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nThen turn 26, move up to (3,4) to eat food.\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nNow head at (3,4), direction up.\n\nThen turn 27, I need to move. Possible: U to (3,5), L to (2,4), R to (4,4)\n\n(4,4) is fine, or (3,5) to go up.\n\nBut there is food at (5,6), but we decided it's not reachable, so ignore.\n\n(3,5) is free, no food.\n\nI should go right to explore or to avoid dead ends.\n\nSince the snake is long, I should move to open areas.\n\nFor example, move R to (4,4) on turn 27.\n\nThen from (4,4), direction right (since moved right from (3,4)? Head was at (3,4), move R to (4,4), so direction R.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (4,5), D to (4,3), R to (5,4), L not allowed (reverse).\n\nNow (4,5) is free, (4,3) might be free or not, (5,4) free.\n\n(4,3): is it occupied? After turn 27 move to (4,4), let's track positions.\n\nAfter turn 26: head (3,4), body (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)  // 8 segments\n\nTurn 27: move R to (4,4), no food? (4,4) has no food, so no eat.\n\nNew head (4,4), body: old head (3,4) becomes B1, old B1 (3,3) B2, old B2 (3,2) B3, old B3 (4,2) B4, old B4 (4,1) B5, old B5 (5,1) B6, old B6 (6,1) B7, and tail old B7 (6,2) removed? With growth earlier, it has 8 segments.\n\nAfter turn 26 eat: 8 segments.\n\nTurn 27 move to (4,4) no food: new head (4,4), B1: (3,4), B2: (3,3), B3: (3,2), B4: (4,2), B5: (4,1), B6: (5,1), B7: (6,1), and tail (6,2) removed, so new tail at (6,1)? Positions:\n\nOld after turn 26: pos0 (3,4), pos1 (3,3), pos2 (3,2), pos3 (4,2), pos4 (4,1), pos5 (5,1), pos6 (6,1), pos7 (6,2) tail\n\nAfter move to (4,4) no food: new pos0 (4,4), pos1 old pos0 (3,4), pos2 old pos1 (3,3), pos3 old pos2 (3,2), pos4 old pos3 (4,2), pos5 old pos4 (4,1), pos6 old pos5 (5,1), pos7 old pos6 (6,1)  // old pos7 (6,2) removed\n\nTail at (6,1)\n\nNow head at (4,4), direction R.\n\nTurn 27: moved R.\n\nNow turn 28, possible moves: U to (4,5), D to (4,3), R to (5,4)\n\n(4,5) free, (4,3) free? (4,3) not in body, not wall.\n\n(5,4) free.\n\nI can move U to (4,5) to go up.\n\nOr R to (5,4).\n\n(5,4) is closer to where (3,1) is, but not directly.\n\n(3,1) is at bottom.\n\nBut I can move D to (4,3) to go down.\n\nBut direction is R, so D is not reverse, U and R are possible.\n\nReverse would be L, which is not allowed.\n\nSo U, D, R possible.\n\nSay I move U to (4,5) to avoid going down and getting stuck.\n\nTurn 28: U to (4,5)\n\nHead at (4,5), direction U.\n\nThen turn 29, possible moves: U to (4,6), but (4,6) is internal obstacle, wall, so cannot.\n\nL to (3,5), R to (5,5), D not allowed (reverse).\n\nSo L or R.\n\n(3,5) free, (5,5) free.\n\nMove R to (5,5) to go right.\n\nTurn 29: R to (5,5)\n\nHead at (5,5), direction R.\n\nThen turn 30, possible: U to (5,6), but (5,6) had food but it disappeared after turn 28, so no food now.\n\nD to (5,4), L to (4,5) but (4,5) is body now? After previous moves.\n\nAfter turn 28: head at (4,5), let's not track all, but (5,6) gone, (5,5) free.\n\nMove to (5,5), then from there, I can go to (5,6) but no food, or (6,5), etc.\n\nBut I need to think about (3,1) food.\n\n(3,1) life span 10, so at turn 30, life span left: at turn 25, life span 10, turn 26:9, t27:8, t28:7, t29:6, t30:5, so still time.\n\nFrom current position, I can head down.\n\nFor example, from (5,5), move D to (5,4) on turn 30.\n\nThen continue down.\n\nBut with the snake, I need to ensure I don't collide.\n\nSince I need to output actions, and the state may change, but for now, I should define a sequence.\n\nBack to turn 25 decision.\n\nI think moving up is better.\n\nSo for turn 25: U\n\nThen turn 26: U to eat (3,4)\n\nThen turn 27: let's say R to (4,4)\n\nThen turn 28: I can move D to (4,3) to start going down towards (3,1)\n\nFrom (4,4), after turn 27, head at (4,4), direction R.\n\nTurn 28 move D to (4,3)\n\nD is down, which is not reverse since direction was R, so ok.\n\nMove to (4,3), no food, so positions shift.\n\nHead at (4,3), direction D.\n\nThen possible moves: L to (3,3), R to (5,3), U not allowed (reverse), D to (4,2)\n\n(4,2) might be body or not.\n\nAfter moves: earlier, body should have moved.\n\nBut (3,3) and (5,3) should be free.\n\nSay move L to (3,3) on turn 29.\n\nThen to (3,2) or (3,4), but (3,4) might be body.\n\nFrom (3,3), can go to (3,2) down.\n\n(3,2) may be free after body moves.\n\nThen to (3,1) to eat.\n\nBut let's specify.\n\nTo eat (3,1), I need to approach it.\n\nSince I have at least 5 turns to plan, I can output:\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U (to eat (3,4))\n\nThen for turn 27, I need to choose.\n\nSince the grid is open, I can go right.\n\nBut to be consistent, let's go towards the bottom later.\n\nFor the answer, I can output 5 actions.\n\nBut the food at (3,1) can be eaten around turn 30 or so.\n\nBut for now, for turns 25 to 29 or 30.\n\nSince the prompt says \"think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions starting from t1.\n\nI think moving up first is the best to avoid risk and get the food.\n\nMoreover, moving down to (3,1) might lead to immediate constraint.\n\nSo I'll go with U at turn 25.\n\nThen U at turn 26.\n\nThen for turn 27, from (3,4) after eating, move R to (4,4) to go right.\n\nTurn 27: R\n\nThen from (4,4), move D to (4,3) to go down. turn 28: D\n\nThen from (4,3), move L to (3,3) to go left towards (3,1). turn 29: L\n\nThen from (3,3), move D to (3,2) or to (2,3), etc.\n\nBut (3,2) might be body at some point, but after moves, it should be free.\n\nAfter turn 29 at (3,3), direction L or D? After moving L to (3,3), direction L.\n\nThen turn 30, can move L to (2,3), D to (3,2), U not allowed.\n\n(3,2) should be free by then, so move D to (3,2).\n\nThen to (3,1) later.\n\nBut for 5 turns, up to turn 29.\n\nturns: 25,26,27,28,29.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: R\n\nTurn 28: D\n\nTurn 29: L\n\nBut I need to ensure these are valid.\n\nAt turn 25: from (3,2) head dir L, move U to (3,3) valid.\n\nTurn 26: from (3,3) dir U, move U to (3,4) valid, eat food.\n\nTurn 27: from (3,4) dir U, move R to (4,4) valid, no reverse.\n\nTurn 28: from (4,4) dir R, move D to (4,3) valid.\n\nTurn 29: from (4,3) dir D, move L to (3,3) valid? (3,3) may be occupied or not.\n\nAfter turn 28 move to (4,3), let's see positions.\n\nAfter turn 27: head at (4,4), body (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) tail at (6,1) approximately.\n\nTurn 28 move D to (4,3): no food, so new head (4,3), body: (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), and tail (6,1) removed, so new body: pos0 (4,3), pos1 (4,4), pos2 (3,4), pos3 (3,3), pos4 (3,2), pos5 (4,2), pos6 (4,1), pos7 (5,1) tail.\n\n(3,3) is pos3, so occupied.\n\nNow turn 29, from (4,3) head, direction D (since moved down).\n\nPossible moves: L to (3,3), but (3,3) is body, collision.\n\nR to (5,3), U to (4,4) but (4,4) is body now, and U is reverse? Direction D, so moving U is reverse, not allowed.\n\nD to (4,2) but (4,2) is body? (4,2) is pos5 in body.\n\nSo possible moves: L to (3,3) body collision, R to (5,3), D to (4,2) body collision.\n\nOnly R to (5,3) is possible, and (5,3) should be free.\n\nSo I should move R to (5,3) on turn 29.\n\nIn my earlier plan, I said L to (3,3), but it would collide.\n\nMistake.\n\nSo from (4,3) after turn 28, only move R to (5,3) or if other, but only R is safe.\n\nD to (4,2) is occupied, L to (3,3) occupied, U reverse not allowed.\n\nSo only R.\n\nThen turn 29: R to (5,3)\n\nThen head at (5,3), direction R.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut for the sequence, at turn 29, I need to move R.\n\nIn the output, I can adjust.\n\nSince moving down on turn 28 might not be best, I could go up or right earlier.\n\nTo avoid this, from (4,4) on turn 28, instead of moving down, move up to (4,5).\n\nTurn 28: U to (4,5)\n\nThen head at (4,5), direction U.\n\nThen turn 29, as before, U to (4,6) obstacle, so must move L or R.\n\nSay move R to (5,5)\n\nThen etc.\n\nBut I'm moving away from (3,1).\n\nBut for short term, it's ok.\n\nTo prioritize eating (3,1) later, I should not go up.\n\nPerhaps at turn 27, from (3,4), instead of moving R, move L to (2,4) or D, but D not allowed.\n\nFrom (3,4) dir U, can move L to (2,4) or D not allowed.\n\nMove L to (2,4) on turn 27.\n\nThen from (2,4), can move down or left.\n\nBut (3,1) is down and right.\n\nComplicated.\n\nI think for simplicity, I'll go with the initial up move and then right to open area.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U (eat food at (3,4))\n\nTurn 27: R (to (4,4))\n\nThen turn 28: U (to (4,5)) to avoid the down move issue.\n\nTurn 28: U to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 29: since U not possible to (4,6), move R to (5,5) for example.\n\nTurn 29: R to (5,5)\n\nThen turn 30: from (5,5) dir R, can move U to (5,6) but no food, D to (5,4), L to (4,5) but may be body, R to (6,5), etc.\n\nBut for 5 turns, up to turn 29 is fine.\n\nThe answer should include actions from turn 25 onwards for several turns.\n\nSince the format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" and I need to think ahead, but output the sequence.\n\nI think for turn 25, moving U is best.\n\nThen for subsequent, I can define.\n\nPerhaps for the box, I output 5 actions.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: R\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: R\n\nBut at turn 28, from (4,4) to (4,5) is up, and at turn 29 from (4,5) to (5,5) is right, valid.\n\nThen it should be ok.\n\nTo make it consistent, I'll go with that.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score while prioritizing long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned multiple turns ahead. The key considerations are:\n\n- **Food Priorities**: \n  - (1,6) with life span 1 disappears after this turn and is unreachable, so ignore.\n  - (5,6) with life span 4 is too distant to reach before it disappears (min 6 moves needed, only 4 turns until last chance at turn 28), so ignore.\n  - (3,4) with life span 7 must be eaten by turn 31. It is close (2 moves away) and can be eaten efficiently by moving up.\n  - (3,1) with life span 10 can be eaten later (by turn 34) after accessing more open areas.\n\n- **Risks and Survival**:\n  - Moving down to (3,1) on turn 25 provides an immediate reward but traps the snake in the bottom-left corner with limited escape routes (only left to (2,1)), increasing collision risk with walls or body in subsequent turns.\n  - Moving left to (2,2) delays eating (3,4) and may lead to inefficient paths.\n  - Moving up to (3,3) on turn 25 avoids the corner, positions the snake to eat (3,4) on turn 26, and opens access to the safer center and right areas, reducing long-term risk.\n\n- **5-Turn Plan**:\n  - **Turn 25**: Move up (U) to (3,3). This avoids the risky down move, positions for (3,4), and keeps options open.\n  - **Turn 26**: Move up (U) to (3,4) to eat the food (value +1, length increases). This secures the urgent food early.\n  - **Turn 27**: Move right (R) to (4,4). This explores open space, avoids reverse move issues, and starts moving toward less congested areas.\n  - **Turn 28**: Move up (U) to (4,5). This continues into open space, steering clear of the obstacle at (4,6) and the bottom-left trap.\n  - **Turn 29**: Move right (R) to (5,5). This maintains momentum into safe areas, with future options to access (3,1) later via downward moves when feasible.\n\nThis sequence eats one food quickly, avoids all immediate collisions and dead ends, and ensures the snake remains in open areas for future food opportunities. Beyond turn 29, the snake can head downward to eat (3,1) when the path is clear, leveraging its long life span.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 25: U \\\\\nTurn 26: U \\\\\nTurn 27: R \\\\\nTurn 28: U \\\\\nTurn 29: R\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 26, and I'm playing as the snake AI. The grid size isn't explicitly given, but from the wall borders, it seems like a 7x7 grid because x ranges from 0 to 7 and y from 0 to 7, so that's 8x8? Let's clarify.\n\nThe walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6? No, let's think: if x=0 and x=7 are walls, and similarly for y, then the grid cells are from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,y) and (7,y) for all y, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x are walls. But it says \"Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\", so all cells where x is 0 or 7 or y is 0 or 7 are walls. So the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Let's confirm with the snake positions.\n\nSnake positions: [(3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)]. All these are within x=1 to 6 and y=1 to 6? (4,1): y=1, but y=1 is not y=0 or y=7, so it should be playable. Similarly, (6,1), (6,2) — x=6 is not x=0 or x=7? x=7 is wall, but x=6 should be fine. Walls are x=0 and x=7, so x from 1 to 6 are not walls, similarly y from 1 to 6 are not walls. y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 is the bottom row? Let's define coordinates.\n\nAssume the grid is 8x8 with cells (0,0) to (7,7). Walls: all (0,y) for y=0 to 7, all (7,y) for y=0 to 7, all (x,0) for x=0 to 7, all (x,7) for x=0 to 7. But that would make the corners double-walled, but it's fine. Playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, so a 6x6 grid? x=1 to 6 inclusive, that's 6 cells, similarly y, so 6x6 playable area.\n\nBut let's check snake positions: (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2). (4,1): y=1, which should be playable since y=1 is not wall (walls at y=0). Similarly, (6,1): x=6, not wall. Also, internal obstacle: (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is a wall, so that cell is blocked.\n\nNow, food positions:\n\n- (5,6) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (3,4) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (3,1) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food has value 1, so all positive food. No negative food mentioned, so all are good to eat, but we need to consider the risks.\n\nSnake head is at (3,3), direction is U (up), so currently moving upwards.\n\nSnake body: head (3,3), then (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2). So length is 7 segments.\n\nNow, head direction is U, so from (3,3), moving up would go to (3,4).\n\nCurrent possible moves: since head direction is U, I can move U, L, or R, but not D because that would be instant reverse. Rule: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. So from U, I can go U, L, or R, not D.\n\nNow, let's see the grid state.\n\nFirst, list all occupied cells:\n\n- Walls: all x=0, x=7 for all y; all y=0, y=7 for all x; plus internal (4,6).\n\nSo walls: for example, (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7), but since it's borders, it's covered. And (4,6).\n\n- Snake: (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\n- Food: (5,6), (3,4), (3,1)\n\n(3,1) is a food position, but (3,1) is also occupied by the snake? Snake positions: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), but not (3,1). Snake: (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2). So (3,1) is not part of snake, it's free, but has food.\n\n(3,1) has food with life span 9.\n\nBut (3,1) is adjacent to snake body? Let's see positions.\n\nI need to think about what moves I can make now at turn 26.\n\nHead at (3,3), direction U.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: to (3,4)\n\n- L: to (2,3)\n\n- R: to (4,3)\n\nNot D, because opposite direction.\n\nNow, check if these cells are safe:\n\n- (3,4): is this a wall? Walls: y=7 is top wall, y=0 bottom, x=0 left, x=7 right. (3,4) is x=3,y=4, which should be within playable area, not wall. Also, no internal wall at (3,4), internal is (4,6). So not wall. Is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), etc. (3,4) is not listed, so free? But there is food at (3,4) with value 1, life span 6.\n\nFood at (3,4), so if I move U to (3,4), I eat that food.\n\nBut I need to consider if it's safe to eat.\n\nFirst, moving to (3,4):\n\n- If I move U to (3,4), I eat the food there, so snake grows: new head at (3,4), and tail stays, so body becomes [(3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)]? When you eat food, you grow, so the tail doesn't move that turn. Rule: when eating food, length increases by 1, so the new position is added at head, tail remains.\n\nSnake movement: normally, when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, tail moves away from last cell. When eating, head moves to food cell, tail does not move, so snake grows by one.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (3,4) which has food, I eat it, so new head is (3,4), body segments remain, so snake becomes: head (3,4), then previous head (3,3), then (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) — that's 8 segments now.\n\nBut (6,2) is the tail.\n\nNow, is (3,4) safe? No immediate collision? Moving to (3,4), which is free, not wall, not body except that it might be under snake? But food can be under body, but in this case, (3,4) is not under snake, it's free with food.\n\n\"Food can spawn under snake's body\" but here (3,4) is not under body, it's empty.\n\nSnake positions don't include (3,4), so it's fine.\n\nBut after moving, head at (3,4), and body has (3,3) which is adjacent, but that's fine, since the body will be behind.\n\nNow, other moves: L to (2,3)\n\n(2,3): x=2,y=3, not wall, not occupied? Snake positions: no (2,3), so free, no food there, so just move, no eat. Snake moves: head to (2,3), tail moves from (6,2)? Current tail is (6,2), when moving, if no eat, tail moves away.\n\nAfter move L: head to (2,3), then body: (3,3) becomes second, (3,2), etc., and tail (6,2) moves off? Sequence: new positions: head (2,3), then previous positions except tail is removed? Let's think.\n\nStandard snake: when moving without eating, the head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, so the tail segment is vacated.\n\nSo from current: positions index 0 to 6: [ (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) ] head at idx 0.\n\nMove to new head position, say new_pos.\n\nThen new body: [new_pos, pos[0], pos[1], pos[2], ..., pos[5]] since length 7, after move without eat, length same, so positions [new_pos, pos[0], pos[1], ..., pos[5]] which means the last pos[6] is removed.\n\nSo for move L to (2,3): new positions: head (2,3), then (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) — and (6,2) is removed.\n\nSimilarly, if move U to (3,4) and eat, then new positions: head (3,4), then (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) — all kept, length 8.\n\nNow, R to (4,3)\n\n(4,3): is it free? Snake positions: no (4,3), walls: (4,6) is wall but (4,3) is not, so free, no food, so just move.\n\nNew positions: head (4,3), then (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) — tail (6,2) removed? Current positions: idx0 (3,3), idx1 (3,2), idx2 (4,2), idx3 (4,1), idx4 (5,1), idx5 (6,1), idx6 (6,2)\n\nAfter move R to (4,3): new head (4,3), then pos[0]=(3,3), pos[1]=(3,2), pos[2]=(4,2), pos[3]=(4,1), pos[4]=(5,1), pos[5]=(6,1) — so tail was pos[6]=(6,2) removed, new positions: (4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) — length 7.\n\nNow, back to turn 26 decision.\n\nI need to think multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns.\n\nAlso, consider food life spans.\n\nFood at:\n\n- (5,6): life span 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn 26, life span 4, so it will disappear after turn 26+4-1? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo if life span is L at turn t, it will disappear after L more turns, meaning it exists for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and gone at turn t+L.\n\nFor example, at turn t, life span L, then:\n\n- After turn t, life span becomes L-1 for next turn.\n\n- When life span reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nSo for (5,6): at turn 26, life span 4, so it exists on turns 26,27,28,29, and disappears on turn 30.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4): life span 6 at turn 26, exists turns 26 to 31, gone turn 32.\n\n(3,1): life span 9, exists turns 26 to 34, gone turn 35.\n\nNow, snake head at (3,3), direction U.\n\nI need to prioritize long-term survival and maximize score.\n\nFirst, immediate options:\n\n- Move U to (3,4): eat food, grow to length 8, head now at (3,4), direction U.\n\n- Move L to (2,3): no eat, head at (2,3), direction L (since moved left).\n\n- Move R to (4,3): no eat, head at (4,3), direction R.\n\nNow, let's evaluate risks and future moves.\n\nIf I move U to (3,4) and eat, I get +1 score, but now the snake is longer, which might make it harder to maneuver. Also, after eating, head at (3,4), and the body is behind.\n\nWhat are the adjacent cells from (3,4)? U to (3,5), D to (3,3) but (3,3) is body, so cannot move D, L to (2,4), R to (4,4).\n\n(3,5): y=5, not wall, no body? Currently body has (3,3) and (3,2), etc., (3,5) free.\n\n(2,4): free, (4,4): free? (4,4) is not wall, not snake.\n\nBut there is a wall at (4,6), but (4,4) is fine.\n\nAlso, food at (5,6) which is far.\n\nBut after eating at (3,4), I need to think where to go next.\n\nSince I need to think ahead, let's consider not eating now and saving the food for later or something.\n\nThere is food at (3,1), which is below, but head is at (3,3), moving down would be reverse, not allowed, so I can't go directly down to (3,2) because it's occupied by body anyway.\n\n(3,2) is body, so I can't move there regardless.\n\nFrom (3,3), possible moves U, L, R.\n\nIf I move L to (2,3), then head at (2,3), direction L.\n\nThen from there, I can move L to (1,3)? (1,3) x=1,y=3, not wall, or U to (2,4), or D to (2,2), not R to (3,3) because reverse.\n\n(3,3) is body, so not accessible anyway.\n\nSimilarly, move R to (4,3), then can go U to (4,4), D to (4,2) but (4,2) is body, or L to (3,3) reverse, or R to (5,3).\n\n(4,2) is body, so from (4,3), moving D to (4,2) would collide with body.\n\nSo only possible moves from (4,3) would be U to (4,4) or R to (5,3), since L is reverse to R? Head direction after moving R is R, so can move U, D, R, not L.\n\nDirection: after moving R to (4,3), head direction is R.\n\nSo from (4,3) with direction R, possible moves: U (up), D (down), R (right), not L (left, reverse).\n\nNow cells:\n\n- U to (4,4): free\n\n- D to (4,2): but (4,2) is body, occupied, so collision if move there.\n\n- R to (5,3): free, no body.\n\nSo only U or R from (4,3).\n\nBut D is not possible because occupied.\n\nSimilarly, other positions.\n\nNow, back to turn 26.\n\nI need to consider the food at (3,1). It has long life span, 9 turns, so not urgent.\n\nFood at (5,6) has short life span, only 4 turns, so if I want to eat it, I need to reach it soon.\n\n(5,6) is at x=5,y=6.\n\nHead at (3,3), so distance: Δx=2, Δy=3, so Manhattan distance 5, so I need at least 5 moves to reach, but with obstacles.\n\nDirectly: from (3,3) to (5,6), I need to go right and up.\n\nBut there is a wall at (4,6), which is adjacent to (5,6)? (4,6) is wall, (5,6) is food.\n\n(5,6) is at x=5,y=6.\n\nWalls: y=6 is not wall, walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable. x=6 is playable, x=5 is playable.\n\nBut (4,6) is an internal wall, so cell (4,6) is blocked.\n\nTo reach (5,6), from say (5,5) or (4,5) or (6,6), etc.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can go right to (4,3), then to (5,3), then to (5,4), to (5,5), to (5,6) — that's 5 moves, but from (5,5) to (5,6) is up, and (5,6) is food.\n\nBut at turn 26, if I start moving, I can be at (5,6) by turn 31, but food disappears after turn 29? Life span 4 at turn 26, so exists turns 26,27,28,29, gone turn 30.\n\nTurn 26: current\n\nTurn 27: move\n\nTurn 28: move\n\nTurn 29: move\n\nTurn 30: move — but on turn 30, if I reach (5,6), but food disappears on turn 30? \"disappears after N turns\" — let's read.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn t, life span L, it exists at turn t.\n\nAfter turn t, at turn t+1, life span is L-1.\n\nWhen life span is 1, it exists that turn, and after that turn, it disappears, so for next turn, it's gone.\n\nFor (5,6) at turn 26, life span 4: exists at turn 26 (current), after turn 26, at turn 27, life span 3, exists at 27; turn 28, life span 2; turn 29, life span 1, exists at 29; after turn 29, at turn 30, life span 0, so gone, not available at turn 30.\n\nSo last chance to eat is on turn 29.\n\nSimilarly, for (3,4), life span 6 at turn 26, exists until turn 31 (turns 26 to 31, gone at 32).\n\n(3,1) until turn 34.\n\nTo eat (5,6), I need to be at (5,6) on or before turn 29.\n\nTurn 26: I can move\n\nIf I go directly, minimum moves: from (3,3) to (5,6), need to increase x by 2, y by 3, so 5 moves, but I can do it in 5 moves if I go right and up efficiently.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 26: move R to (4,3)\n\nTurn 27: from (4,3), can move R to (5,3) (direction R, so possible)\n\nTurn 28: from (5,3), move U to (5,4) (now direction U)\n\nTurn 29: from (5,4), move U to (5,5)\n\nBut (5,5) to (5,6) is one more move, on turn 30, but food gone on turn 30, so not available.\n\nOn turn 29, I am at (5,5), and food at (5,6) is available, but I need to move to (5,6) to eat it.\n\nOn turn 29, if I am at (5,5), I can move U to (5,6) to eat it.\n\nBut on turn 29, food exists.\n\nLet's sequence:\n\nTurn 26: start at (3,3), move R to (4,3) — turn 26 action\n\nThen turn 27: from (4,3), move R to (5,3) — now at (5,3)\n\nTurn 28: from (5,3), move U to (5,4) — at (5,4)\n\nTurn 29: from (5,4), move U to (5,5) — at (5,5)? No, to (5,5) on turn 29? Turn 28 I am at (5,4), turn 29 move to (5,5), but (5,6) is above, so on turn 29 I am at (5,5), not at (5,6).\n\nTo be at (5,6) on turn 29, I need to be there on the move of turn 29.\n\nFor example:\n\nIf on turn 26 I move U to (3,4), but that eats the food there, which might delay me.\n\nFrom (3,3), if I move R to (4,3) on turn 26\n\nTurn 27: from (4,3), move U to (4,4) — but direction: after moving R, direction R, then moving U is possible, now at (4,4), direction U.\n\nTurn 28: from (4,4), move U to (4,5) — at (4,5)\n\nTurn 29: from (4,5), move R to (5,5)? But (5,5) is not (5,6), still not.\n\n(4,5) to (5,6) is not adjacent, diagonal, not possible.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can move U to (4,6), but (4,6) is wall, internal obstacle, cannot move there.\n\nSo cannot go via (4,5) to (5,6).\n\nBetter to go via right side.\n\nFrom (3,3), move R to (4,3)\n\nTurn 27: move R to (5,3) — at (5,3)\n\nTurn 28: move U to (5,4) — at (5,4)\n\nTurn 29: move U to (5,5) — at (5,5)\n\nBut (5,5) to (5,6) is one move, on turn 30, but turn 30 food is gone.\n\nOn turn 29, I am at (5,5), and food at (5,6) is present, but I can only eat it if I move to it on turn 29, but I am at (5,5) on turn 29 after move, so to move to (5,6) I need turn 30, but turn 30 it's gone.\n\nLet's clarify the turn timing.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position, I choose action, then I move to the new cell, and if there is food, I eat it at that turn.\n\nFor example, at turn t, I am at some cell, I choose to move to a cell with food, I eat it during turn t.\n\nFor (5,6), I need to be moving to it on a turn when it exists, i.e., turn 29 or earlier.\n\nTo be at (5,6) on turn 29, I need to arrive there on turn 29.\n\nSo from turn 26, I need to reach in 3 moves? Turn 26 to 29 is 3 moves later.\n\nTurn 26: move to new position, which is turn 26 action.\n\nAfter turn 26 action, I am at new position for turn 27 state.\n\nLet's define the state.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, the state is given, including positions.\n\nThen I choose action for turn t, which moves me to a new cell for turn t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, the state is updated.\n\nFor food, if I move to a food cell on turn t, I eat it on turn t.\n\nFor (5,6) to be eaten on turn t, t must be <=29.\n\nSo to eat on turn 29, I need to move to (5,6) on turn 29.\n\nSimilarly, on turn 26, I am at (3,3), distance to (5,6) is |5-3| + |6-3| = 2 + 3 = 5 Manhattan distance.\n\nWith 3 moves (turn 26,27,28), I can reduce the distance by at most 3, so on turn 28, I can be at most distance 2, but (5,6) requires distance 0 to eat, so on turn 28, I can be at (5,6) only if I can cover 5 units in 3 moves, which is impossible since each move is 1 unit. Minimum moves to cover Manhattan distance d is d, so 5 moves needed.\n\nFrom turn 26 to turn 28 is two moves? Turn 26 action: move to new cell, so after turn 26 action, I am at position for turn 27.\n\nThen turn 27 action: move to new position for turn 28.\n\nThen turn 28 action: move to new position for turn 29 state.\n\nLet's list the positions:\n\n- At start of turn 26: head at (3,3)\n\n- After turn 26 action: new head position, say P26\n\n- At start of turn 27: head at P26\n\n- After turn 27 action: new head position P27\n\n- Start turn 28: head at P27\n\n- After turn 28 action: P28\n\n- Start turn 29: head at P28\n\n- After turn 29 action: P29\n\nTo eat at (5,6) on turn 29, I need P29 = (5,6)\n\nP29 is the position after turn 29 action, which is the cell I move to on turn 29.\n\nTo be at (5,6) on turn 29 after action, I need to move to it on turn 29.\n\nThe position at start of turn 29 is P28, and I move from P28 to P29.\n\nSo for P29 to be (5,6), P28 must be adjacent to (5,6), and I move to it.\n\nSimilarly, to have P28 at a cell adjacent to (5,6) on turn 29 start.\n\nBut on turn 29 start, position P28.\n\nTo eat on turn 29, I move to (5,6) on turn 29 action.\n\nThe earliest I can be at (5,6) is turn 26 if I could, but I can't in 0 moves.\n\nWith k moves, I can be at a cell within k steps.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (5,6), min 5 moves.\n\nAfter turn 26 action: 1 move, can be up to distance 1.\n\nAfter turn 27: up to distance 2, etc.\n\nAfter turn 29 action: after 4 moves, I can be at distance up to 4 from start, but (5,6) is distance 5, so I cannot reach (5,6) by turn 29 with actions on turns 26,27,28,29.\n\nActions: on turn t, I move, so after turn t action, I have made one move.\n\nFrom start turn 26 to after turn 26 action: 1 move.\n\nAfter turn 27 action: 2 moves.\n\n...\nAfter turn 29 action: 4 moves.\n\nWith 4 moves, from (3,3), I can reach cells within Manhattan distance 4.\n\n(5,6) is |5-3| + |6-3| = 2+3=5, which is distance 5, so impossible to reach in 4 moves.\n\nTherefore, I cannot eat (5,6) at all, because the last possible turn to eat is turn 29, and I can't reach it by then.\n\nIs that right? Distance 5, min 5 moves required.\n\nAfter turn 29 action, I have made 4 moves from turn 26 start? Let's count the number of actions.\n\nAt turn 26, I perform an action, moving to a new cell.\n\nThis is the position for turn 27 state.\n\nThen turn 27 action, move to new cell for turn 28 state.\n\nTurn 28 action, move to new cell for turn 29 state.\n\nTurn 29 action, move to new cell for turn 30 state.\n\nTo eat on turn 29, I move to (5,6) on turn 29 action, so for that, at start of turn 29, I must be at a cell adjacent to (5,6), and move to it.\n\nThe position at start of turn 29 is after turn 28 action.\n\nAfter turn 28 action, I am at P for turn 29 state.\n\nP must be adjacent to (5,6) to move to it on turn 29.\n\nNow, from start turn 26 to after turn 28 action (turn 29 start), I have made 3 moves: turn 26,27,28 actions.\n\nWith 3 moves, from (3,3), I can reach cells within distance 3.\n\n(5,6) is distance 5, so no cell adjacent to (5,6) is within distance 3 of (3,3)? Cells adjacent to (5,6): (5,5), (5,7), (4,6), (6,6).\n\n(5,7): y=7 is wall, since border, so invalid.\n\n(4,6): internal wall, blocked.\n\n(6,6): x=6,y=6, not wall, playable.\n\n(5,5): x=5,y=5, playable.\n\nSo possible adjacent cells: (5,5) and (6,6).\n\nDistance from (3,3) to (5,5): |5-3| + |5-3| = 2+2=4\n\nTo (6,6): |6-3| + |6-3| =3+3=6\n\nWith 3 moves, I can reach cells within distance 3, so (5,5) is distance 4, which requires at least 4 moves, so I cannot reach (5,5) in 3 moves from (3,3).\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) distance 6, impossible.\n\nTherefore, there is no way to be adjacent to (5,6) on turn 29 start with only 3 moves from turn 26.\n\nHence, I cannot eat (5,6) at all; it will disappear before I can reach it.\n\nSo I should ignore (5,6) and focus on other food.\n\nNow, food at (3,4) and (3,1).\n\n(3,4) is adjacent to current head (3,3), so I can eat it now by moving U.\n\nBut there is a risk: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn this case, if I eat at (3,4), where is the tail?\n\nCurrent tail is at (6,2).\n\nHead at (3,3), tail at (6,2), not adjacent, distance |3-6| + |3-2| =3+1=4, not adjacent.\n\nAfter eating, if I eat at (3,4), tail is still at (6,2), not adjacent.\n\nSo no immediate danger.\n\nBut after eating, snake is longer, which might cause issues later.\n\n(3,1) has food, which is below, but I can't go directly down.\n\nNow, let's think about the map.\n\nPlayable grid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, but walls at borders and (4,6) blocked.\n\nAlso, snake body: (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nSo the bottom row y=1 has (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), and (6,2) is above.\n\n(3,1) is free with food.\n\nNow, from head (3,3), if I don't eat (3,4), I can move L or R.\n\nIf I move U to (3,4), I eat, grow to length 8.\n\nThen from (3,4), I can move U to (3,5), L to (2,4), R to (4,4).\n\n(3,5) is free, (2,4) free, (4,4) free.\n\nBut (4,6) is wall above.\n\nAlso, the tail is at (6,2), which will move when I don't eat.\n\nBut after eating, tail stays.\n\nNow, if I move L to (2,3) on turn 26, no eat.\n\nThen head at (2,3), direction L.\n\nThen from there, I can move L to (1,3), U to (2,4), D to (2,2).\n\n(2,2): is it free? Snake has (3,2), but not (2,2), so free.\n\nNo food there.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3): x=1,y=3, not wall, free.\n\nIf I move R to (4,3), no eat, head at (4,3), direction R.\n\nThen from (4,3), I can move U to (4,4) or R to (5,3), since D to (4,2) is body, and L to (3,3) is reverse and body.\n\n(4,2) is body, so cannot move D.\n\nSo only U or R.\n\nIf I go U to (4,4), then from there, etc.\n\nNow, the food at (3,1) is below, with long life span.\n\nBut to reach it, I need to go down.\n\nCurrently, from (3,3), I can't go down directly.\n\nIf I move L to (2,3), then I can move D to (2,2), then to (2,1) or (3,2), but (3,2) is body.\n\nFrom (2,3), move D to (2,2), then from (2,2), I can move D to (2,1), L to (1,2), R to (3,2) but (3,2) is body, so not possible.\n\nSo from (2,2), possible moves: U to (2,3) reverse? After moving D to (2,2), direction D, so can move L, R, D, not U.\n\nSo D to (2,1), L to (1,2), R to (3,2) but (3,2) occupied, so only D or L.\n\n(2,1) is free? y=1, not wall, no snake? Snake has (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), not (2,1), so free.\n\nThen to (3,1), from (2,1) I can move R to (3,1), which has food.\n\nSimilarly, if I go other ways.\n\nBut let's think about the tail reward danger for (3,1).\n\n(3,1) has food, and if I eat it, I grow.\n\nBut tail is at (6,2), not adjacent.\n\nBut after I eat, the tail might be there or not.\n\nBut the danger is only if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, but in this case, when I move to (3,1), the tail is not at (3,1), so no issue.\n\nThe rule is: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake\"\n\nSo when I eat the food at a cell, if at that moment the head is adjacent to the tail, and the tail cell has food, but the food is at the head cell, not tail cell.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIt says \"the tail cell has positive food\", meaning the cell where the tail is located has food on it.\n\nThen, if I eat that food (when moving head to tail cell?), but I eat food at head cell, not at tail cell.\n\nThe scenario is: if the tail is on a cell that has food, and the head is adjacent to the tail, then if I move the head to the tail cell to eat that food, after eating, the tail doesn't move, so the head and tail are on the same cell, collision.\n\nBecause when you eat, you grow, so head moves to food cell, tail stays, but if head moves to tail cell, then head and tail are together, but tail is still there, so collision.\n\nFor example, if tail is at a cell with food, and head is adjacent, and I move head to tail cell, then head moves to that cell, which has food, so I eat it, grow, but since tail doesn't move, the cell now has both head and tail? No, the head moves to the cell, so the tail cell is now occupied by head, and the tail segment is still there, so they occupy the same cell, collision.\n\nYes, that's the danger.\n\nIn other cases, no problem.\n\nIn this state, for (3,4), tail is at (6,2), not adjacent, and (6,2) has no food, so no danger.\n\nSimilarly for (3,1), tail at (6,2), not adjacent.\n\nSo no immediate danger.\n\nBack to decision.\n\nSince (5,6) is unreachable, I should consider eating (3,4) now or later.\n\nBut if I don't eat it now, it might be eaten later, or I can come back.\n\nBut life span is 6, so plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) has life span 9.\n\nBut I need to survive and eat as much as possible.\n\nAlso, the snake body is taking some space.\n\nCurrent snake positions: (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nSo it's like a path from (3,3) down to (3,2), right to (4,2), down to (4,1), right to (5,1), right to (6,1), up to (6,2).\n\nTail at (6,2).\n\nIf I don't eat, and move, the tail will move away, freeing cells.\n\nFor example, if I move L to (2,3), then new positions: (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) — tail (6,2) removed, so (6,2) free.\n\nSimilarly, if I move R to (4,3), positions: (4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) — tail (6,2) removed, (6,1) is now tail? Positions: head (4,3), then (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) so tail at (6,1).\n\n(6,2) freed.\n\nIf I move U to (3,4) and eat, then positions: (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) — all kept, length 8.\n\nNow, to maximize score, eating food is good, but I need to avoid trapping myself.\n\nSince the grid is small, 6x6 with an obstacle, and snake is long, 7 segments, so space is limited.\n\nPlayable cells: 6x6 = 36 cells, minus one wall at (4,6), so 35 cells.\n\nSnake occupies 7, so 28 free, but with food, etc.\n\nBut after moving, cells free.\n\nI should plan a path to eat both foods without dying.\n\nAlso, the head direction matters for reverse move.\n\nLet's think 5 turns ahead.\n\nFirst, option: move U to (3,4) on turn 26, eat food.\n\nThen head at (3,4), direction U.\n\nTurn 27: from (3,4), I can move U to (3,5), L to (2,4), or R to (4,4).\n\nSay I move U to (3,5) to go up.\n\nThen at (3,5), direction U.\n\nTurn 28: from (3,5), move U to (3,6)? But y=6, is it wall? Walls at y=7, so y=6 is playable. (3,6) is free? No food, no wall, not snake? Snake has (3,4), (3,3), etc., not (3,6), so free.\n\nMove to (3,6), direction U.\n\nBut (3,6) is below (4,6) wall, but (3,6) is ok.\n\nThen turn 29: from (3,6), I can move L to (2,6), R to (4,6) but (4,6) wall, or D to (3,5) reverse, not allowed, or U to (3,7) but y=7 wall, so only possible L to (2,6) or, since direction U, can move L or R, not D or U? U to (3,7) wall, so only L or R.\n\nMove L to (2,6) or R to (4,6) wall, so only L to (2,6).\n\nAt (2,6), direction L.\n\nThen turn 30: from (2,6), can move L to (1,6), D to (2,5), U to (2,7) wall, R to (3,6) reverse, so not R.\n\nU wall, so L or D.\n\nAnd so on. But I need to get to (3,1) eventually.\n\nFrom above, I am going up, away from (3,1).\n\nAfter eating at (3,4), I could move L or R instead.\n\nFor example, turn 26: move U to (3,4) eat.\n\nTurn 27: move L to (2,4) — from (3,4) move L to (2,4), direction L.\n\nThen at (2,4), turn 28: move L to (1,4), or D to (2,3), or U to (2,5), not R.\n\n(2,3) is free? After turn 26, if I ate, positions include (3,3), but (2,3) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4) free.\n\nBut I am at left, still not down.\n\nTo go down, from (3,4), I could move R to (4,4) on turn 27.\n\nThen at (4,4), direction R.\n\nTurn 28: from (4,4), can move U to (4,5), D to (4,3), or R to (5,4), not L.\n\n(4,3) is body? After turn 26 eat, positions: head (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nSo (4,3) is not occupied, free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) free.\n\n(5,4) free.\n\nIf I move D to (4,3) on turn 28, then at (4,3), direction D.\n\nThen turn 29: from (4,3), can move D to (4,2), but (4,2) is body, occupied, so collision.\n\nCannot move D.\n\nMove L to (3,3) but (3,3) is body, occupied.\n\nMove R to (5,3), or U to (4,4) but U is reverse to D? After moving D to (4,3), direction is D, so can move L, R, D, not U.\n\nD to (4,2) occupied, L to (3,3) occupied, so only R to (5,3).\n\nMove to (5,3), then from there, etc.\n\nBut I am not closer to (3,1).\n\n(3,1) is at bottom left.\n\nPerhaps I should not eat at (3,4) now, so that I can move down.\n\nFor example, on turn 26, move L to (2,3) instead of U.\n\nThen no eat, head at (2,3), direction L.\n\nThen turn 27: from (2,3), I can move L to (1,3), U to (2,4), or D to (2,2).\n\nNow, (2,2) is free, so I can move D to (2,2) to go down.\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen turn 28: from (2,2), direction D, can move L to (1,2), D to (2,1), or R to (3,2) but (3,2) is body, occupied, so not R.\n\nSo L or D.\n\nMove D to (2,1), for example.\n\nThen at (2,1), direction D.\n\nTurn 29: from (2,1), can move L to (1,1), D to (2,0) but y=0 wall, or R to (3,1), or U to (2,2) reverse, not U.\n\nD wall, so L or R.\n\nR to (3,1) has food, so I can move to (3,1) and eat it on turn 29.\n\nSimilarly, I can reach (3,1) in a few moves.\n\nLet's sequence:\n\nTurn 26: move L to (2,3) — at (2,3), no eat.\n\nNew positions: head (2,3), then (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) — tail (6,2) removed.\n\nTurn 27: from (2,3), move D to (2,2) — possible, direction D.\n\nAt (2,2), no eat.\n\nNew positions: head (2,2), then (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) — tail (6,1) removed? Previous positions: after turn 26, positions: (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) — tail (6,1)\n\nAfter move to (2,2), new head (2,2), then previous head (2,3), then (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) — so tail (6,1) removed, new tail (5,1).\n\nTurn 28: from (2,2), move D to (2,1) — direction D, move to (2,1), no food there.\n\nAt (2,1), new positions: head (2,1), then (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1) — tail (5,1) removed.\n\nTurn 29: from (2,1), move R to (3,1) — (3,1) has food, so eat it.\n\nNew head at (3,1), and since eat, tail does not move, so positions: head (3,1), then (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1) — length 8 now, since ate.\n\nPrevious length 7, after eat, length 8.\n\nBefore turn 29, positions: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1) — 7 segments.\n\nAfter move to (3,1) and eat, new positions: (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1) — 8 segments, tail at (4,1).\n\nNow, I have eaten (3,1), and (3,4) is still there with life span decreasing.\n\nLife span of (3,4): at turn 26, 6, so turn 27:5, turn 28:4, turn 29:3, turn 30:2, etc.\n\nI can go to eat (3,4) later.\n\nIn this path, on turn 29 I ate (3,1), so I have score.\n\nBut I missed (3,4) for now, but it's still available.\n\nIf on turn 26 I move U to (3,4), I eat it now, then I have to go down to (3,1), which might take longer.\n\nFor example, turn 26: move U to (3,4) eat.\n\nThen head at (3,4), direction U.\n\nTurn 27: move L to (2,4) — at (2,4), direction L.\n\nTurn 28: move D to (2,3) — at (2,3), direction D.\n\nTurn 29: move D to (2,2) — at (2,2), no eat yet.\n\n(2,2) no food.\n\nThen turn 30: move D to (2,1) — at (2,1)\n\nTurn 31: move R to (3,1) eat.\n\nBut (3,4) was eaten on turn 26, and (3,1) on turn 31.\n\nIn the first path, I ate (3,1) on turn 29 and can eat (3,4) later.\n\nIn the first path without eating (3,4) now, I ate (3,1) on turn 29.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (3,4).\n\nAfter turn 29, head at (3,1), direction R (since moved right to get there).\n\nPositions: (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1)\n\nTail at (4,1).\n\nFrom (3,1), I can move U to (3,2), but (3,2) is body, occupied, cannot.\n\nMove L to (2,1) but (2,1) is body, occupied.\n\nMove R to (4,1) but (4,1) is body, occupied.\n\nMove D? y=1, D to (3,0) wall, not possible.\n\nOh! Problem! From (3,1), with body around, I cannot move anywhere except to occupied cells or wall.\n\n(3,1): adjacent cells:\n\n- U: (3,2) — occupied by body\n\n- D: (3,0) — wall\n\n- L: (2,1) — occupied by body\n\n- R: (4,1) — occupied by body\n\nAll adjacent cells are blocked! So if I go to (3,1) and eat, I am trapped and die on the next turn.\n\nIn the sequence where I move to (3,1) on turn 29, after eating, I am at (3,1) with body at (2,1), (3,2), and (4,1), all adjacent occupied, so no move possible, collision on next turn.\n\nTherefore, that path is deadly.\n\nI must avoid that.\n\nSo I should not eat (3,1) when the head is surrounded.\n\nIn this case, (3,1) is a corner with body around.\n\nTo eat (3,1) safely, I need to have a way out.\n\nFor example, if the tail is moving away, freeing space.\n\nIn the earlier path without eating (3,4), when I move to (3,1), if the tail has moved, it might be free.\n\nIn the turn 26 move L to (2,3), then down to (2,2), to (2,1), then to (3,1).\n\nBut when I move to (3,1) on turn 29, what are the adjacent cells?\n\nAt that time, positions before move: on turn 29 start, after turn 28 action, positions are (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1) — head at (2,1)\n\nThen move to (3,1), which is adjacent and has food, so eat.\n\nAfter move, positions: (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1)\n\nNow, from (3,1), adjacent:\n\n- U: (3,2) — occupied by body\n\n- D: (3,0) wall\n\n- L: (2,1) — occupied by body\n\n- R: (4,1) — occupied by body\n\nAll blocked, same as before.\n\nBecause the body is surrounding it.\n\nThe only free cell was (3,1) but after moving there, it's occupied, and adjacent are body.\n\nSo I am trapped.\n\nTherefore, I cannot eat (3,1) directly from that approach because it leads to death.\n\nI need to eat it when there is an escape route.\n\nFor example, if I approach from above or something.\n\n(3,1) has only three adjacent cells: (3,2), (2,1), (4,1), since down is wall.\n\n(3,2) and (2,1), (4,1) are often occupied.\n\nTo eat (3,1) safely, I need that when I eat it, at least one adjacent cell is free for the next move.\n\nBut after eating, the snake is longer, so it might be tight.\n\nPerhaps I should not eat (3,1) at all, or only after freeing space.\n\nBut it has value, so I should eat it if possible.\n\nAnother idea: move right first to free the tail area.\n\nFor example, on turn 26, move R to (4,3).\n\nThen no eat, head at (4,3), direction R.\n\nPositions: (4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) — tail (6,2) removed.\n\nTurn 27: from (4,3), move R to (5,3) — possible, direction R.\n\nAt (5,3), positions: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) — tail (6,1) removed.\n\nTurn 28: from (5,3), move U to (5,4) — at (5,4), direction U.\n\nPositions: (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1) — tail (5,1) removed.\n\nNow, (3,1) is still there, and (3,4) etc.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can go left or down to reach (3,1).\n\nBut let's see if I can eat (3,1) later with space.\n\nFor example, turn 29: from (5,4), move L to (4,4) — at (4,4), no food.\n\nThen turn 30: move L to (3,4) — but (3,4) has food, so eat if I move there.\n\n(3,4) has food, life span: at turn 26,6, turn 30, life span 2 (since turn 27:5, 28:4, 29:3, 30:2), so exists.\n\nMove to (3,4) on turn 30, eat.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nBack to (3,1).\n\nIn the position after turn 28, positions are (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1)\n\n(3,1) is free with food.\n\nTo eat (3,1), I need to move to it from adjacent cell.\n\nAdjacent cells to (3,1): (3,2), (2,1), (4,1)\n\n(3,2) is body, occupied.\n\n(2,1) is free? Not occupied in current positions.\n\n(4,1) is body, occupied.\n\nSo only (2,1) is free.\n\nSo I can move to (3,1) from (2,1) or from above, but above is (3,2) occupied.\n\nOnly from (2,1).\n\nSo I need to be at (2,1) to move to (3,1).\n\nBut (2,1) is free now.\n\nFrom current head at (5,4), I can go to (2,1) in a few moves.\n\nBut Manhattan distance |5-2| + |4-1| =3+3=6, so at least 6 moves.\n\nBut life span of (3,1) is 9 at turn 26, turn 28:7 left, so plenty of time.\n\nBut I have other food.\n\nPerhaps for turn 26, I should move U to (3,4) and eat, to get the food before it might be too late, but it has life span 6, so not urgent.\n\nSince the grid is small, I need to create space.\n\nAnother thought: the food at (3,4) can be eaten now, and it might be safer to eat it and then maneuver.\n\nBut after eating, I am longer, which might be worse.\n\nLet's list all possible actions for turn 26.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (3,4) - eat food, grow to 8, head at (3,4), direction U.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (3,5) or (2,4) or (4,4).\n\nIf I go to (3,5), then to (3,6), then to (2,6), etc., but that might lead to dead end.\n\nOr go to (2,4), then to (2,3), but (2,3) might be free.\n\nAfter eating at (3,4), positions: (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nFrom (3,4), move L to (2,4) on turn 27.\n\nThen at (2,4), direction L.\n\nTurn 28: move D to (2,3) — (2,3) is free? Yes, not occupied.\n\nAt (2,3), direction D.\n\nTurn 29: move D to (2,2) — (2,2) free, at (2,2), direction D.\n\nTurn 30: move D to (2,1) — (2,1) free, at (2,1), direction D.\n\nTurn 31: move R to (3,1) — (3,1) has food, eat.\n\nBut when I move to (3,1), adjacent cells: U (3,2) body, D wall, L (2,1) body, R (4,1) body, all blocked, so trapped, die on next turn.\n\nSame problem.\n\nTo avoid this, I need that when I eat (3,1), the cell (3,2) or (4,1) is free, but they are part of the body.\n\nIf the tail has moved away, it might be free.\n\nIn the above, when I am at (2,1) on turn 31, positions before move: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2) -- let's trace the positions.\n\nAfter turn 26: eat at (3,4), positions: (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nTurn 27: move L to (2,4), no eat, so new positions: head (2,4), then (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) -- tail (6,2) removed.\n\nTurn 28: move D to (2,3), no eat, positions: head (2,3), then (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) -- tail (6,1) removed.\n\nTurn 29: move D to (2,2), no eat, positions: head (2,2), then (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1) -- tail (5,1) removed.\n\nTurn 30: move D to (2,1), no eat, positions: head (2,1), then (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2) -- tail (4,1) removed.\n\nTurn 31: move R to (3,1), eat food, so new positions: head (3,1), then (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2) -- length 8, tail at (4,2).\n\nNow, from (3,1), adjacent cells:\n- U: (3,2) -- occupied by body (part of snake)\n- D: (3,0) wall\n- L: (2,1) -- occupied by body\n- R: (4,1) -- is it occupied? Positions include (4,2), but (4,1) is not in the list, so free? Positions: head (3,1), then (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2)\n\nSo cells: (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2)\n\n(4,1) is not occupied, so free.\n\nR to (4,1) is possible.\n\nAlso, U to (3,2) occupied, L to (2,1) occupied, D wall.\n\nSo I can move R to (4,1) on next turn.\n\n(4,1) is free, no food, so I can move there.\n\nThen not trapped.\n\nIn this case, after eating at (3,1), I can move R to (4,1) to escape.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) might have options.\n\nSo it is safe to eat (3,1) when (4,1) is free.\n\nIn this sequence, by moving down the left side, I freed the right side, so (4,1) is free when I need it.\n\nTherefore, for turn 26, moving U to (3,4) to eat, then going left and down to eat (3,1) later is possible and safe.\n\nIf I don't eat (3,4) now, I can still eat it later.\n\nBut let's see the score: if I eat (3,4) on turn 26 and (3,1) on turn 31, I have two foods.\n\nIf I eat only (3,1) later, but (3,4) might expire or something, but life span 6, turn 31 is within, since turn 26 to 31 is 6 turns, turn 31 it exists if life span at turn 26 is 6, exists until turn 31.\n\nTurn 31: at turn 26, life span 6, exists turns 26 to 31, gone turn 32.\n\nSo on turn 31, I can eat (3,4) if I am there.\n\nIn the sequence above, after eating (3,1) on turn 31, I am at (3,1), then I can go to (3,4) via (4,1) etc.\n\nBut (3,4) is far.\n\nSince I ate (3,4) early, I have the score sooner.\n\nBut both ways I can eat both.\n\nNow, for the current turn, I need to choose an action for turn 26.\n\nAlso, there is the food at (5,6) which we can't reach, so ignore.\n\nSo options:\n\n- Move U to (3,4): eat now, then go left/down to eat (3,1) later.\n\n- Move L to (2,3): no eat, then go down to (2,1), then to (3,1) to eat, but when I eat (3,1), I need to ensure an escape.\n\nIf I move L on turn 26, no eat.\n\nThen turn 27: move D to (2,2)\n\nTurn 28: move D to (2,1)\n\nTurn 29: move R to (3,1) eat.\n\nAt that point, positions before move: on turn 29 start, after turn 28, positions: head (2,1), then (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1) -- assuming earlier moves.\n\nAfter turn 26 move L to (2,3): positions (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\nTurn 27 move D to (2,2): positions (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) -- tail (6,1) removed\n\nTurn 28 move D to (2,1): positions (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1) -- tail (5,1) removed\n\nTurn 29 move R to (3,1) eat: positions (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1)\n\nNow adjacent: U (3,2) occupied, D wall, L (2,1) occupied, R (4,1) occupied? (4,1) is in positions, occupied.\n\nPositions: (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1)\n\nSo (4,1) is occupied, so R to (4,1) not possible.\n\nL (2,1) occupied, U (3,2) occupied, D wall, no move, trapped.\n\nWhereas in the first sequence where I ate (3,4) and went left, when I ate (3,1), (4,1) was free because the tail had moved.\n\nIn this case without eating (3,4), (4,1) is still occupied when I eat (3,1).\n\nSo to eat (3,1) safely, I need to have the tail moved away so that one of the adjacent cells is free.\n\nTherefore, moving U to (3,4) first might be better because it forces the tail to stay or something, but in the sequence where I ate (3,4), when I went left, the tail moved away from the right.\n\nIn both cases, I can arrange.\n\nBut for turn 26, I think moving U to (3,4) is fine, as I can then proceed to eat (3,1) with an escape.\n\nSimilarly, I can consider moving R first.\n\nBut to save time, for turn 26, I can move U to (3,4) to eat the food.\n\nThen for future turns, I can plan.\n\nSince the question is to output actions for multiple turns, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the answer format is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but I need to specify how many turns? It says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but it doesn't specify how many, so perhaps for the immediate decision, and then the next moves can be decided later, but since it says think ahead, I should provide a sequence.\n\nBut in the context, I think for this response, I need to provide the action for turn 26, and perhaps a few more.\n\nBut let's see the format.\n\n\"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action on turn t1 Turn t1 + 1: action on turn t1 + 1 ... }\"\n\nAnd \"each action in {U, D, L, R}\"\n\nSo I need to provide a sequence of actions starting from turn 26.\n\nHow many? It doesn't say, but since it says think 5+ turns ahead, I should provide at least 5 actions.\n\nBut the state might change with food disappearance, but in this case, no new food, only existing.\n\nI can provide a sequence for 5 turns.\n\nFirst, at turn 26, move U to (3,4) to eat the food.\n\nThen turn 27: from (3,4), move L to (2,4) to start going left/down.\n\nTurn 28: from (2,4), move D to (2,3)\n\nTurn 29: from (2,3), move D to (2,2)\n\nTurn 30: from (2,2), move D to (2,1)\n\nThen turn 31: from (2,1), move R to (3,1) to eat.\n\nBut in this, on turn 31 I eat (3,1), and as before, I can then move R to (4,1) if free.\n\nIn the positions, by turn 30, the tail has moved, so (4,1) might be free.\n\nLet's simulate the positions up to turn 30.\n\nTurn 26: move U to (3,4) eat, so positions: (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)  length 8\n\nTurn 27: move L to (2,4) no eat, so new head (2,4), then (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) -- tail (6,2) removed, positions: (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)\n\nTurn 28: move D to (2,3) no eat, head (2,3), then (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1) -- tail (5,1) removed\n\nTurn 29: move D to (2,2) no eat, head (2,2), then (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2) -- tail (4,1) removed\n\nTurn 30: move D to (2,1) no eat, head (2,1), then (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) -- tail (4,2) removed\n\nNow (3,1) is free, and from (2,1), I can move R to (3,1) on turn 31 to eat.\n\nAfter eating, positions: (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) -- length 8\n\nThen from (3,1), I can move R to (4,1) since (4,1) is free (not in positions), and no wall.\n\nThen continue.\n\nIf on turn 26 I move something else, but this seems reasonable.\n\nMove R on turn 26 to avoid eating now, but then I might eat later.\n\nBut since (3,4) is there, I can eat it now.\n\nAlso, for the answer, I need to output actions.\n\nSo for turn 26: U\n\nThen for the next turns, as above.\n\nBut I need to specify the sequence.\n\nSince the grid is small, and to avoid risks, moving U to eat now is fine.\n\nAnother option: move R on turn 26 to (4,3), then I can go to eat (3,4) later or something.\n\nBut (3,4) is close, so better to eat it.\n\nI think U is good.\n\nSo for turn 26: U\n\nThen turn 27: from (3,4), I need to choose, say L to (2,4)\n\nTurn 28: D to (2,3)\n\nBut in the sequence above, I have turn 27 L, turn 28 D to (2,3), etc.\n\nBut for the output, I can provide 5 turns: turn 26 to 30.\n\nTurn 30 action is to (2,1), then turn 31 to (3,1) but that's turn 31.\n\nPerhaps provide up to turn 30.\n\nSince think ahead, but output what I can.\n\nI think for now, I'll go with eating (3,4) now and moving left.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: L  (to (2,4))\n\nTurn 28: D  (to (2,3))\n\nTurn 29: D  (to (2,2))\n\nTurn 30: D  (to (2,1))\n\nThen on turn 31, move R to (3,1) to eat, but not in this sequence.\n\nFor the box, I can put 5 actions.\n\nBut turn 30 is t1+4, since t1=26, t1+4=30.\n\nt1=26, t1+1=27, ..., up to t1+4=30.\n\nActions for 5 turns.\n\nIn turn 29, I move to (2,2), turn 30 to (2,1).\n\nFrom (2,1), on turn 31 I can eat (3,1).\n\nBut for the sequence, it's fine.\n\nTo have eating both, but in 5 turns, I only eat one food.\n\nBut that's ok.\n\nI can start with U on 26.\n\nSo decision for turn 26 is U.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score while ensuring long-term survival, I have planned a sequence of moves for turns 26 to 30, considering the current state and thinking at least 5 turns ahead. The key priorities are:\n- Eat the positive food at (3,4) immediately on turn 26, as it is adjacent and has a moderate life span (6 turns remaining), but avoiding it could lead to missed opportunities or increased risk later.\n- Avoid the unreachable food at (5,6) (life span 4, cannot be reached by turn 29).\n- Safely approach the food at (3,1) later, ensuring an escape route exists after eating to prevent trapping the snake.\n- Manage the snake's length and body to avoid collisions, leveraging the tail movement to free space.\n\nThe planned moves:\n- **Turn 26: Move U (up) to (3,4)** to eat the food there. This increases the score by +1 and grows the snake to length 8. The head direction becomes U.\n- **Turn 27: Move L (left) to (2,4)** to start navigating toward the left side, freeing space on the right for future movement. No food eaten; snake length remains 8. Head direction becomes L.\n- **Turn 28: Move D (down) to (2,3)** to continue descending toward the bottom-left area. No food eaten; snake length remains 8. Head direction becomes D.\n- **Turn 29: Move D (down) to (2,2)** to position for accessing (3,1). No food eaten; snake length remains 8. Head direction becomes D.\n- **Turn 30: Move D (down) to (2,1)** to set up for eating (3,1) on turn 31. No food eaten; snake length remains 8. Head direction becomes D.\n\n### Reasoning and Lookahead (5+ Turns):\n- **Turn 26 (U to (3,4))**: Eating (3,4) now secures +1 score while the food is available. The tail is at (6,2), not adjacent, so no Tail Reward Danger. After eating, the snake grows, but moving left immediately avoids congestion and starts creating space.\n- **Turn 27 (L to (2,4))**: Moving left frees the tail cell (6,2) and avoids the body. The path keeps options open to descend.\n- **Turn 28 (D to (2,3))**: Descending further; (2,3) is safe and not occupied. The tail movement frees (5,1), reducing body density.\n- **Turn 29 (D to (2,2))**: Continuing down; (2,2) is free. This positions the snake to reach (2,1) next.\n- **Turn 30 (D to (2,1))**: Reaching (2,1) sets up for eating (3,1) on turn 31. At this point, (4,1) is free (due to tail movement), providing an escape route after eating (3,1).\n- **Beyond Turn 30**: On turn 31, move R (right) to (3,1) to eat that food (life span 9, still available). After eating, (4,1) is free, allowing a move right to avoid trapping. Then, navigate to open areas (e.g., (4,1) or (3,4) if still present) for more food.\n\n### Risk Mitigation:\n- **Collision Avoidance**: All moves avoid walls, body segments, and instant reverses. For example:\n  - On turn 28, moving D from (2,4) to (2,3) is valid and safe.\n  - After eating (3,1) on turn 31, moving R to (4,1) prevents trapping.\n- **Food Access**: (3,4) is eaten immediately; (3,1) is accessed safely by turn 31 with a free adjacent cell (4,1) for escape.\n- **Survival Focus**: The sequence prioritizes freeing space via tail movement (e.g., by not eating on turns 27-30) and avoids the high-risk area near (5,6) and the obstacle at (4,6).\n\nThis plan scores +1 by turn 26 and sets up for another +1 by turn 31, with minimal risk.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: L\nTurn 28: D\nTurn 29: D\nTurn 30: D\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 27. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (4,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n\nSnake positions: head at (3,4), then (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2). So the snake has 8 segments. Head direction is Up, meaning it was moving upwards last turn.\n\nFood: two pieces:\n\n- (5,6) with life span 3 and value +1 (positive food)\n\n- (3,1) with life span 8 and value +1 (also positive food)\n\nBoth are positive, no negative food here.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for turns 27, 28, 29, etc., thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score and avoid risks.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid. I'll make a mental map.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls on all borders and (4,6).\n\nSnake: head (3,4), body: (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2). Tail is (6,2).\n\nFood at (5,6) and (3,1).\n\nHead direction is U (up), so last move was up to (3,4).\n\nNow, possible moves from (3,4): since head is at (3,4) and direction is U, I can move U, L, or R, but not D because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. Current direction is U, so opposite is D, so I cannot move down immediately.\n\nPossible actions from (3,4): Up, Left, Right.\n\n- Up: to (3,5)\n\n- Left: to (2,4)\n\n- Right: to (4,4)\n\nNow, I need to check for collisions or dangers.\n\nFirst, walls: (3,5) is within bounds, y=5 <7, x=3 between 0 and 7. No wall at (3,5), since internal wall only at (4,6).\n\nSimilarly, (2,4): x=2>0, y=4 between 0 and 7, no wall.\n\n(4,4): x=4<7, y=4, no wall.\n\nNow, snake body: current positions: (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nIf I move to (3,5), is that occupied? (3,5) not in snake positions, so safe.\n\n(2,4) not occupied.\n\n(4,4) not occupied.\n\nBut I also need to consider future positions because the snake moves.\n\nMoreover, food: (5,6) and (3,1)\n\n(3,1) is currently occupied by the snake body! Snake has (4,1), (5,1), etc., but (3,1) is a food position, and it's listed, but is it under the snake?\n\nSnake positions: (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\n(3,1) is not in the snake positions; let's list all: x,y pairs:\n\n- Head: (3,4)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (4,2)\n\n- (4,1)\n\n- (5,1)\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (6,2) tail\n\nSo (3,1) is not occupied by snake; it's a food cell. Similarly, (5,6) is free.\n\nFood at (3,1) and (5,6).\n\n(3,1) is at x=3,y=1, which is not occupied by snake, so it's available to eat if head moves there.\n\nBut the food is under the snake only if the body is on it, but here (3,1) is not occupied, so it's just a regular food cell.\n\nThe rule says food can spawn under body, but here it's not under body; it's at (3,1), which is empty.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) is empty.\n\nNow, life spans: (5,6) has life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n\nSo at turn 27, life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 29? Let's see.\n\nLife span N: disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n\nSo at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1? Or after how many turns.\n\nTypically, if life span is N at turn t, it decreases by 1 each turn, so after N turns it's gone. But since it decreases including current turn, at turn t, it has N turns left including turn t.\n\nSo for (5,6): at turn 27, life span 3, so it will be there for turns 27, 28, 29, and disappear before turn 30? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo at turn t, with life span L, it decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nSo for (5,6): turn 27, L=3 → turn 28, L=2 → turn 29, L=1 → turn 30, L=0, disappears before turn 30 or after? \"Disappears after N turns\" might be ambiguous.\n\nBut \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at start of turn 27, L=3, after turn 27, it decreases to 2, so it can be eaten on turn 27,28,29, and gone on turn 30.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1): L=8 at turn 27, so it will last until turn 34 or something.\n\nNow, back to moves.\n\nI need to think about eating food, but also avoiding dead ends.\n\nFirst, let's see the map.\n\nGrid:\n\n- Rows y=0 to 7, columns x=0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all borders, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, cannot go there.\n\nAlso internal obstacle at (4,6), so (4,6) is wall.\n\nSnake: positions:\n\n- (3,4) head\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (4,2)\n\n- (4,1)\n\n- (5,1)\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (6,2) tail\n\nSo the snake is mostly on the left and bottom.\n\nFood: (5,6) at top-right, and (3,1) at bottom-left.\n\n(3,1) is near the snake body.\n\nNow, head at (3,4), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,5), L to (2,4), R to (4,4)\n\nI need to consider each option and think ahead.\n\nFirst, if I move Up to (3,5) on turn 27.\n\nThen head at (3,5), direction U.\n\nFrom there, possible moves U to (3,6), L to (2,5), R to (4,5)\n\n(3,6) is within bounds, not wall except borders, y=6<7, ok.\n\n(2,5) ok.\n\n(4,5) ok, but (4,6) is wall, so (4,5) is safe.\n\nNow, food at (5,6), which is close.\n\nIf I go to (3,5) on turn 27, then I can go to (4,5) on turn 28, then to (5,5) on turn 29? But food is at (5,6), not (5,5).\n\n(5,6) is at x=5,y=6.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can go U to (4,6) but (4,6) is wall, cannot.\n\nOr L to (3,5) but that's back, or R to (5,5), or D to (4,4).\n\n(4,5) to (5,5) is right.\n\nThen from (5,5), I can go U to (5,6) to eat food, since (5,6) is not wall? (5,6): x=5,y=6, borders are x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (5,6) is not border, and no internal wall except (4,6), so (5,6) is free.\n\nBut life span: at turn 27, L=3, so on turn 28, L=2, turn 29 L=1, turn 30 gone.\n\nIf I move on turn 27 to (3,5), turn 28 to (4,5), turn 29 to (5,5), then on turn 30 I can go to (5,6) but food might be gone? Turn 30 it disappears, so I need to eat on turn 29 or earlier.\n\nLet's sequence:\n\nTurn 27: move to (3,5) — head now at (3,5), direction U\n\nTurn 28: from (3,5), I can move to (4,5) (right), then direction R.\n\nThen at (4,5), I can move to (5,5) (right) on turn 29.\n\nThen from (5,5), I can move to (5,6) (up) on turn 30 to eat, but on turn 30, food at (5,6) has L=0? At turn 27, L=3.\n\nAfter turn 27, L decreases to 2 for turn 28.\n\nAfter turn 28, L=1 for turn 29.\n\nAfter turn 29, L=0, so food disappears before turn 30? The food is available to be eaten during the turn when L >0.\n\nCountdown decreases after the turn, I think.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nAnd \"disappears after N turns\".\n\nI think it's standard that at the beginning of turn, if L>0, it can be eaten that turn, and after being eaten or at end of turn, L decreases.\n\nBut to be precise: \"disappears after N turns\" meaning it lasts for N turns starting from now.\n\nFor example, with L=3 at turn t, it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, t+2, and disappears after turn t+2, so not available on turn t+3.\n\nIn this case, turn 27: L=3, so available on turns 27,28,29.\n\nOn turn 30, it's gone.\n\nSo to eat (5,6), I must be there on turn 27,28, or 29.\n\nSimilarly for (3,1), L=8, available for many turns.\n\nBack to path: if I go to (3,5) on turn 27, then on turn 28 I can go to (4,5), then turn 29 to (5,5), but (5,5) to (5,6) is turn 30, which is too late; food gone.\n\nFrom (4,5) on turn 28, I could go directly to (5,6)? From (4,5) to (5,6) is not adjacent; (4,5) to (5,6) is diagonal, not allowed. Moves are only U,D,L,R, so not diagonal.\n\nSo from (4,5), I can go to (5,5) or (4,6) but (4,6) wall, or (3,5), or (4,4).\n\nCannot go directly to (5,6) from (4,5).\n\nSo to reach (5,6), I need to be at (5,5), (4,6), (6,6), or (5,7) but (4,6) wall, (5,7) y=7 is wall, (6,6) possible, but from (4,5) it's not adjacent.\n\nAdjacent cells to (5,6) are: (5,5) down, (5,7) up but y=7 wall, (4,6) left but wall, (6,6) right.\n\nSo only (5,5) and (6,6) are accessible neighbors.\n\n(5,5) and (6,6).\n\nNow, from my current position, to eat on turn 29, I need to be at (5,6) on turn 29.\n\nBut from (3,5) on turn 28, I can go to (4,5), then on turn 29 to (5,5), but (5,5) is not (5,6), I need another move to go up to (5,6) on turn 30, too late.\n\nFrom (3,5) on turn 28, I could go to (3,6), then on turn 29 to (4,6) but (4,6) wall, or to (2,6), or to (3,7) but y=7 wall.\n\n(3,6) to (4,6) is right, but wall, so cannot.\n\n(3,6) to (2,6) left, or (3,5) down, or (3,7) up wall.\n\nSo from (3,6), I can go to (2,6) or (3,5).\n\nNot to (5,6) directly.\n\nTo reach (5,6) by turn 29, I need a shorter path.\n\nFrom current position (3,4), on turn 27, if I move right to (4,4), then on turn 28 to (5,4), then on turn 29 to (5,5), then on turn 30 to (5,6) too late.\n\n(4,4) to (5,4) to (5,5) to (5,6) — turn 30.\n\nBut turn 29 is the last chance.\n\nSo to be at (5,6) on turn 29, I need to be at a neighbor on turn 28.\n\nNeighbors of (5,6): (5,5), (6,6)\n\nSo on turn 28, I need to be at (5,5) or (6,6).\n\nOn turn 27, I need to be at a position that can reach (5,5) or (6,6) in one move.\n\nFrom current (3,4), turn 27:\n\nIf I go right to (4,4), then turn 28 I can go to (5,4) or (4,5) or (4,3), etc., but not directly to (5,5) or (6,6).\n\nFrom (4,4), to (5,5) is diagonal, not allowed.\n\nSo to (5,5) from (4,4): I can go to (5,4) then to (5,5), but that's two moves.\n\nSimilarly, to (6,6) from (4,4): (4,4) to (5,4) to (6,4) to (6,5) to (6,6), longer.\n\nFrom (3,4), if I go up to (3,5), turn 27, then turn 28 to (4,5), then turn 29 to (5,5), then turn 30 to (5,6) late.\n\nFrom (3,5) turn 28 to (3,6), then turn 29 to (2,6) or (3,5), not to (5,6).\n\nSo it seems I cannot reach (5,6) by turn 29 from current position with the moves available, because it's too far.\n\nDistance: from (3,4) to (5,6) is |3-5| + |4-6| = 2 + 2 = 4 cells, but moves are one per turn, so to go from (3,4) to (5,6) in two moves, I need to move right twice and up twice, but that's not direct path; the shortest path is at least two moves if diagonal, but since only horizontal/vertical, it takes min |dx| + |dy| moves.\n\n|dx| = 2, |dy| = 2, so min 4 moves? No, from (3,4) to (5,6), I can go right to (4,4), right to (5,4), up to (5,5), up to (5,6) — 4 moves.\n\nOr up to (3,5), up to (3,6), right to (4,6) but wall, so not, or from (3,5) right to (4,5), right to (5,5), up to (5,6) — still 4 moves.\n\nTo reach in fewer, but not possible, since |dx| + |dy| = 4, so at least 4 moves to reach (5,6) from (3,4).\n\nCurrent turn 27, I can move on turn 27,28,29 to be at position on turn 29.\n\nAfter turn 27 move, head at new position on turn 27 end.\n\nTurn 27 action: move to new cell, head there.\n\nThen turn 28 action, etc.\n\nTo be at (5,6) on turn 29, I need to start moving on turn 27.\n\nAfter turn 27 move, head at, say, P1.\n\nAfter turn 28 move, head at P2.\n\nAfter turn 29 move, head at P3, which should be (5,6) to eat on turn 29.\n\nSo from current (3,4) after turn 27 move to, say, (4,4), then turn 28 to (5,4), then turn 29 to (5,5), not (5,6).\n\n(5,5) is not (5,6).\n\nFrom (3,4) to (3,5) turn 27, then (4,5) turn 28, then (5,5) turn 29, then on turn 30 to (5,6) but food gone.\n\nTo be at (5,6) on turn 29, P3 = (5,6), so P2 must be a neighbor of (5,6), which are (5,5) or (6,6).\n\nSo on turn 28, head must be at (5,5) or (6,6).\n\nOn turn 27, head must be at a neighbor of (5,5) or (6,6).\n\nNeighbors of (5,5): (5,4), (5,6), (4,5), (6,5)\n\nBut (5,6) is target, (4,5), (5,4), (6,5)\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) neighbors: (6,5), (6,7) wall, (5,6), (7,6) wall, so only (6,5) and (5,6)\n\nSo to be at (5,5) on turn 28, on turn 27 head must be at (5,4), (4,5), or (6,5)\n\nSimilarly for (6,6): on turn 27 at (6,5) or (5,6)\n\nBut current position (3,4) is not near any of these. From (3,4), I can't reach (5,4), (4,5), or (6,5) in one move on turn 27.\n\nFrom (3,4), turn 27 moves: to (3,5), (2,4), or (4,4)\n\nNone of which are (5,4), (4,5), or (6,5).\n\n(4,4) is close to (4,5) or (5,4), but not there yet.\n\nSo indeed, I cannot reach (5,5) or (6,6) by turn 28 from turn 27 position.\n\nTurn 27 action determines where I am at end of turn 27.\n\nThen turn 28 action to reach the neighbor.\n\nBut to be at (5,5) on turn 28, I need to be at a neighbor on turn 27.\n\nFor example, at turn 27, if I were at (4,5), then I could go to (5,5) on turn 28.\n\nBut I'm at (3,4), not at (4,5).\n\nSo from (3,4), on turn 27, if I go to (4,4), then on turn 28 I can go to (4,5) or (5,4), but not to (5,5) directly.\n\nThen on turn 29 from (4,5) I can go to (5,5), then on turn 30 to (5,6) too late.\n\nSimilarly, from (5,4) on turn 28, I can go to (5,5) on turn 29, then (5,6) on turn 30 late.\n\nSo it's impossible to eat (5,6) by turn 29. The earliest I can reach it is turn 30, but it disappears after turn 29, so I can't eat it at all.\n\nTurn 29 is the last chance; on turn 30 it's gone.\n\nSince I can't reach it by turn 29, I should ignore this food and focus on the other food or survival.\n\n(5,6) is not reachable in time, so I should not pursue it.\n\nNow, the other food is at (3,1), with L=8, so plenty of time.\n\n(3,1) is at bottom-left, near the snake body.\n\nCurrent head at (3,4), body below.\n\n(3,1) is food, and it's not occupied, but the snake has segments at (3,2), (3,3), (4,2), (4,1), etc.\n\nTo eat (3,1), I need to move the head to (3,1).\n\nBut (3,1) is currently adjacent to (3,2) and (4,1), but (3,2) is body, (4,1) is body.\n\nThe rule about food under body: but here the food is not under body; it's at (3,1), which is empty, so I can eat it by moving head there directly.\n\nBut there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn this case, (3,1) is not the tail; tail is at (6,2).\n\n(3,1) is a separate cell.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut when I eat food, the snake grows, so tail doesn't move that turn.\n\nBut for (3,1), it's not near tail, so should be fine.\n\nNow, to reach (3,1) from (3,4).\n\nI can go down, but current direction is U, so I can move D? Current head direction is U, meaning last move was up to (3,4), so from (3,4), I can move U, L, R, but not D because instant reverse.\n\nCannot move down from (3,4) because opposite direction.\n\nSo possible moves: U, L, R.\n\nIf I move down, it's illegal.\n\nSo from (3,4), I can only go up, left, or right.\n\nNot down directly.\n\nTo go to (3,1), I need to go down, but I can't immediately.\n\nI need to manuever.\n\nFirst, let's consider the grid and possible traps.\n\nAlso, the snake body: after moving, the body follows.\n\nFor example, if I move up to (3,5), then the body moves, so (3,4) becomes body, (3,3) stays, etc., tail moves from (6,2) to (6,1)? Let's see the body movement.\n\nWhen head moves to a new cell, the tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed, and new head position.\n\nSo after move, snake positions shift.\n\nFor example, if head moves to new position, the segment that was head is now neck, and the tail segment is removed if no growth, but when eating, tail doesn't move.\n\nBut for now, no eating.\n\nCurrent snake: positions list, head first.\n\nAfter moving head to a new cell, that becomes new head, and the previous positions shift, with the tail cell removed.\n\nSo length same unless eating.\n\nIn this case, no food eaten yet.\n\nSo after turn 27 action:\n\nIf I move U to (3,5), new positions: head (3,5), then (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) — tail was (6,2), but since tail moves, (6,2) is removed, and (6,1) becomes new tail? Positions: original: indices 0: (3,4) head, 1: (3,3), 2: (3,2), 3: (4,2), 4: (4,1), 5: (5,1), 6: (6,1), 7: (6,2) tail.\n\nAfter moving head to new position, say (3,5), new head: (3,5), then the body: previous head (3,4) becomes segment 1, (3,3) segment 2, (3,2) segment 3, (4,2) segment 4, (4,1) segment 5, (5,1) segment 6, and (6,1) segment 7, but the tail (6,2) is not included, so segments are: new head (3,5), then [ (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) ] and the last segment (6,1) is tail, since (6,2) was removed.\n\nSimilarly, if I move L to (2,4), new head (2,4), body (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) tail.\n\n(6,2) removed.\n\nIf move R to (4,4), new head (4,4), body (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) tail.\n\n(6,1) is tail now.\n\nNow, food at (3,1) is available.\n\n(3,1) is at x=3,y=1.\n\nCurrently, it's not occupied, but in the body positions, (3,2) is above it, and (4,1) is right of it.\n\nTo eat it, head must move to (3,1).\n\nFrom current (3,4), I can't go directly down.\n\nI need to go left or right or up first.\n\nBut (3,1) is below, so I need to go down eventually.\n\nSince I can't reverse, I have to change direction.\n\nFor example, if I move left to (2,4), then from there, I can move down to (2,3), etc., but it might take time.\n\nOr move right to (4,4), then down, etc.\n\nBut (3,1) has long life, so no rush.\n\nBut there might be risks.\n\nAnother thing: the area around (3,1) has body segments, so I need to be careful not to trap myself.\n\nLet's list all occupied cells after moves.\n\nAlso, the internal wall at (4,6) but that's far.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should eat the food, but since (5,6) is not reachable, only (3,1) is available food.\n\nBut I can eat (3,1) soon.\n\nHow to reach (3,1) from current position.\n\nHead at (3,4), can move U, L, R.\n\nIf I move R to (4,4) on turn 27.\n\nThen head at (4,4), direction R (since moved right).\n\nThen on turn 28, I can move R to (5,4), D to (4,3), or U to (4,5), not L because instant reverse (opposite of R is L).\n\nFrom (4,4), after moving R, direction is R, so cannot move L to (3,4).\n\nCan move U, D, R.\n\n(4,3) is down.\n\nThen from (4,3), I can move to (4,2), but (4,2) is body? Current body after turn 27: if I moved to (4,4), new positions: head (4,4), body (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) tail.\n\n(4,2) is occupied by body.\n\nOn turn 28, if I move D to (4,3), but (4,3) is not occupied, so safe.\n\nThen head at (4,3), direction D.\n\nThen on turn 29, I can move to (4,2), but (4,2) is body, so collision! (4,2) is occupied by the body segment.\n\nPositions: after turn 27, segments: (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\nSo (4,2) is occupied.\n\nIf I move to (4,3) on turn 28, then on turn 29, from (4,3) I can move U to (4,4) but that's body, or D to (4,2) body, or L to (3,3) body, or R to (5,3).\n\n(5,3) might be free.\n\nBut (3,3) is body, (4,4) is body, (4,2) is body, so only R to (5,3) is possible.\n\nThen at (5,3), I can go to (5,2), (5,4), (6,3), etc.\n\nBut to reach (3,1), it's getting farther.\n\nFrom (4,3), I can only go to (5,3), then from there to (5,2) or (5,4), etc.\n\nBut (3,1) is at (3,1), so I need to go left and down.\n\nBut with body in the way.\n\nPerhaps moving right first is not good for reaching (3,1).\n\nIf I move left on turn 27 to (2,4).\n\nThen head at (2,4), direction L.\n\nThen on turn 28, I can move L to (1,4), D to (2,3), U to (2,5), not R (reverse).\n\n(2,3) is down.\n\nThen from (2,3), I can move to (2,2), (1,3), (2,4) but (2,4) is body, or (3,3) but might be body.\n\nAfter turn 27 move to (2,4), new positions: head (2,4), body (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) tail. (6,2) removed, so tail at (6,1).\n\n(3,4) is body, etc.\n\nOn turn 28, from (2,4), move D to (2,3), which is free.\n\nThen head at (2,3), direction D.\n\nThen on turn 29, from (2,3) I can move D to (2,2), L to (1,3), R to (3,3), or U to (2,4) body.\n\n(2,2) free, (1,3) free, (3,3) is body, so cannot move R to (3,3).\n\nSo can move D to (2,2) or L to (1,3).\n\n(2,2) is free.\n\nThen from (2,2), I can move to (2,1), (1,2), (3,2), but (3,2) is body.\n\n(3,2) is occupied.\n\nSo to (2,1) or (1,2).\n\nThen to reach (3,1), I can go from (2,2) to (2,1), then to (3,1) on turn 30 or something.\n\nLet's sequence.\n\nTurn 27: move L to (2,4)\n\nNew head (2,4), body: (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) tail\n\nTurn 28: move D to (2,3)\n\nHead (2,3), body (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) tail (6,1 removed)\n\nTurn 29: from (2,3), move D to (2,2) (assume free)\n\nHead (2,2), body (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1) tail (5,1 removed? Positions: after turn 28, head (2,3), body (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) tail.\n\nAfter move to (2,2), new head (2,2), body (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1) tail, (5,1) removed.\n\n(3,1) is at (3,1), which is adjacent to (2,1), (3,2), (4,1), (3,0) but y=0 wall.\n\n(3,2) is body, (4,1) is body, so (3,1) has neighbors occupied except (2,1) and possibly (4,1) but (4,1) occupied.\n\n(2,1) is free.\n\nFrom (2,2), on turn 29 I can move to (2,1) or (1,2) or (3,2) but (3,2) body, so only (2,1) or (1,2).\n\nMove to (2,1) on turn 29.\n\nHead (2,1), body (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2) tail (4,1) removed? After turn 29 move to (2,1), new head (2,1), body (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2) tail, (4,1) removed.\n\nNow, (3,1) is adjacent to (2,1), so on turn 30, I can move R to (3,1) to eat the food.\n\nMove from (2,1) to (3,1), which is right.\n\nAnd (3,1) is food, so I eat it, snake grows, so tail doesn't move, new length 9.\n\nBut is there danger? Head at (2,1), moving to (3,1), which is adjacent to tail? Tail is at (4,2), which is not adjacent to (3,1); (4,2) is at distance.\n\n(3,1) neighbors: (2,1), (4,1), (3,2), (3,0) wall.\n\n(4,1) is not tail; tail is (4,2).\n\n(3,2) is body.\n\nBut when I move to (3,1), I eat food, so the snake grows, meaning the tail stays, so new tail is the old tail, and a new segment is added at head.\n\nAfter eating, the tail does not move, so the snake becomes longer.\n\nIn terms of collision, when I move to (3,1), it was empty, so no collision, and since I eat, the tail remains at (4,2), and new segment at (3,1), so head at (3,1), then body includes (2,1), (2,2), etc.\n\nBut (3,1) was not occupied before, so safe.\n\nAnd tail is at (4,2), not adjacent to (3,1), so no tail reward danger.\n\nSo this path seems possible to eat (3,1) on turn 30.\n\nBut turn 27,28,29,30.\n\nCurrent turn 27, so actions: turn 27 L, turn 28 D, turn 29 D to (2,2)? From (2,3) to (2,2) is D, yes.\n\nThen turn 30 R to (3,1) to eat.\n\nBut turn 29 I moved to (2,2), then turn 30 to (3,1).\n\n(2,2) to (3,1) is not adjacent; (2,2) to (3,1) is diagonal, not allowed.\n\nMistake.\n\n(2,2) at x=2,y=2, (3,1) at x=3,y=1, not adjacent; adjacent are (2,1), (2,3), (1,2), (3,2).\n\n(3,1) is at y=1, so from (2,2), I can go to (2,1) down, or (3,2) right, but (3,2) is body, occupied.\n\nOn turn 29, from (2,3), I moved to (2,2), which is down.\n\nThen at (2,2), on turn 30, I can move to (2,1) down, or (1,2) left, or (3,2) right but (3,2) occupied, or (2,3) up but body.\n\nSo only (2,1) or (1,2).\n\n(2,1) is at x=2,y=1.\n\nThen from (2,1), I can move to (3,1) on turn 31.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 27: L to (2,4)\n\nTurn 28: D to (2,3)\n\nTurn 29: D to (2,2)\n\nTurn 30: D to (2,1)\n\nTurn 31: R to (3,1) to eat.\n\nBut (3,1) has life span 8, at turn 27 L=8, turn 28 L=7, ..., turn 31 L=4, still available, so ok.\n\nBut it takes many turns.\n\nFrom current position, if I move up or right, it might take longer.\n\nAnother option: move up on turn 27 to (3,5).\n\nThen head at (3,5), direction U.\n\nThen I can move to, say, (3,6) or (4,5), etc.\n\nBut (3,1) is far, so not efficient.\n\nSince I can't eat (5,6), and (3,1) is the only food, I should go for it, but with fewer moves.\n\nFrom (3,4), if I could move down, but I can't because of direction.\n\nI need to change direction first.\n\nFor example, move left to (2,4), as above, then down.\n\nOr move right to (4,4), then down.\n\nBut with body, it might be blocked.\n\nLet's try moving right on turn 27 to (4,4).\n\nNew head (4,4), body (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) tail.\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 28: from (4,4), can move U to (4,5), D to (4,3), R to (5,4), not L.\n\nMove D to (4,3), free.\n\nHead at (4,3), direction D.\n\nBody: (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) tail (6,1 removed)\n\nTurn 29: from (4,3), can move D to (4,2) but (4,2) occupied, L to (3,3) occupied, R to (5,3), U to (4,4) occupied.\n\nSo only possible move R to (5,3).\n\nHead to (5,3), body (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1) tail (5,1 removed)\n\nThen from (5,3), I can move to (5,2), (5,4), (6,3), (4,3) but (4,3) body.\n\n(5,2) free, etc.\n\nBut to reach (3,1), it's at (3,1), I'm at (5,3), so I need to go left and down, but (4,2), (4,1) are body, so I might be blocked.\n\nFor example, from (5,3) to (5,2), then to (5,1) but (5,1) might be occupied or not.\n\nAfter above, positions have (4,1) and (5,1) but (5,1) was removed, so free? Let's see.\n\nAfter turn 29, head at (5,3), body (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1) tail.\n\nSo (5,1) is free, (5,2) free.\n\nMove to (5,2) on turn 30.\n\nThen to (5,1) on turn 31, but (5,1) is not (3,1).\n\n(3,1) is far left.\n\nSo this way is worse for reaching (3,1).\n\nMoving left first is better.\n\nBut in the left path, it takes 4 moves to reach (2,1), then one more to (3,1), so 5 moves from turn 27.\n\nTurn 27 L to (2,4), 28 D to (2,3), 29 D to (2,2), 30 D to (2,1), 31 R to (3,1).\n\nBut on turn 30 at (2,1), I can move to (3,1) directly? (2,1) to (3,1) is right, adjacent, yes.\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 30 at (2,1), I move to (3,1) on turn 30? No.\n\nTurn 30 action: from position at turn 29 end.\n\nAfter turn 29, I am at (2,2) if I did the down moves.\n\nLet's list positions:\n\nAfter turn 27 action: head at (2,4)\n\nAfter turn 28 action: head at (2,3)\n\nAfter turn 29 action: head at (2,2)\n\nNow, at turn 29 end, head at (2,2), and (3,1) is at (3,1), which is adjacent to (2,1), (3,2), (4,1).\n\n(3,2) is occupied (body), (4,1) is body, (2,1) is free.\n\nFrom (2,2), on turn 30, I can move to (2,1) down.\n\nThen after move, head at (2,1), and (3,1) is adjacent right.\n\nThen on turn 31, move to (3,1) to eat.\n\nSo yes, turn 31 to eat (3,1).\n\nBut I can eat earlier if possible.\n\nFrom current position (3,4), if I move up, it's away.\n\nAnother idea: since the tail is moving, I can go around.\n\nFor example, if I move right to (4,4), then down to (4,3), then right to (5,3), but that's away from (3,1).\n\nNot good.\n\nOr, if I move up to (3,5), then I can go to the top area.\n\nBut there is no food except (5,6) which is expiring.\n\nBut I can't reach it.\n\nPerhaps after moving up, I can find other food, but currently only two foods, both positive.\n\nBut (5,6) will disappear, so no point.\n\nSo only (3,1) to eat.\n\nBut maybe I should think about survival first.\n\nThe grid has walls, and the snake is long, so I need to avoid trapping myself.\n\nFor example, the bottom-left area might be tight.\n\nWith the body at (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), etc., the area around (3,1) has limited space.\n\nAfter I eat (3,1), the snake grows, so it gets longer.\n\nBut let's first plan to eat it.\n\nSince moving left and down is a way, but it takes time.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can move left to (2,4), then on turn 28, instead of down, I could move down later.\n\nBut moving down is necessary.\n\nAnother option: move right on turn 27 to (4,4), then on turn 28 move down to (4,3), then on turn 29 move left to (3,3) but (3,3) is occupied after moves.\n\nAfter turn 27: head (4,4), body (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\nTurn 28: move D to (4,3), head (4,3), body (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) tail\n\n(3,3) is occupied.\n\nOn turn 29, from (4,3), I can only move R to (5,3) as before, not left to (3,3) occupied.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps I can move up first to clear space, but that might not help.\n\nOr, since the food at (3,1) is under the body? No, it's not under, it's adjacent.\n\nBut the rule says food can be under body, but only eaten if body moves away and head moves on.\n\nBut here, (3,1) is not under body; it's free cell with food.\n\nSo I can eat it directly when head moves there.\n\nTo minimize turns, from (3,4), if I move down, but I can't because of direction constraint.\n\nCurrent direction U, so I must move U, L, or R.\n\nSo I have to move sideways or up first.\n\nThe quickest way is to move left then down, as I had.\n\nBut let's see if I can go down sooner.\n\nFor example, after moving left to (2,4), on turn 28 I can move down to (2,3), then on turn 29 I can move right to (3,3) but (3,3) is occupied.\n\nAfter turn 28, head at (2,3), body (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)\n\n(3,3) occupied.\n\nSo from (2,3), I can move to (2,2) or (1,3), not to (3,3).\n\nThen to (2,2), then to (2,1), then to (3,1).\n\nSame as before.\n\nFrom (2,3), move to (1,3), then to (1,2), then to (1,1), then to (2,1), then to (3,1), longer.\n\nSo not better.\n\nTherefore, the sequence to eat (3,1) is: turn 27 L to (2,4), turn 28 D to (2,3), turn 29 D to (2,2), turn 30 D to (2,1), turn 31 R to (3,1) to eat.\n\nBut on turn 30 at (2,1), I move to (3,1) on turn 31.\n\nBut I can think of turn 27 to 31 actions.\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the format says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and output actions for several turns, but it doesn't specify how many to output, but probably for the next few turns.\n\nThe answer format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't say how many.\n\nI should plan a sequence that leads to eating the food.\n\nBut there might be risks in the meantime.\n\nFor example, when I am at (2,2) or (2,1), is there danger?\n\nAlso, the tail is moving, so the body might clear.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (3,1) has long life, so I don't have to rush; I can take a safer path.\n\nBut with the snake body, moving down might be safe.\n\nPerhaps I can go up first to explore or something, but there is no other food, so it might be wasteful.\n\nBut (5,6) is there but expiring, and I can't reach it.\n\nUnless I can, but I think not.\n\nDistance to (5,6): from (3,4) to (5,6) is 2 in x, 2 in y, so 4 moves min, but as before, not possible by turn 29.\n\nSo I think I should go for (3,1).\n\nBut let's consider the grid size and possible dead ends.\n\nFor example, the bottom-left corner: y=0 and x=0 are walls.\n\nAt (2,1), I can move to (2,0) wall, (1,1), (2,2), or (3,1).\n\nBut (2,2) might be body or not.\n\nIn the sequence, when I am at (2,1), on turn 30 end, after moving from (2,2) to (2,1), the body is behind.\n\nBut it should be ok.\n\nTo save turns, is there a way to eat (3,1) faster?\n\nFor example, if I move right first, but that seems worse.\n\nOr, since the snake has a segment at (3,2), which is above (3,1), if I move the head away, the body might move, so (3,2) moves away, then I can come back to (3,1).\n\nFor example, on turn 27, move up to (3,5).\n\nThen head at (3,5), body (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) tail.\n\n(3,2) is still there.\n\nOn turn 28, move to, say, (4,5) right.\n\nHead (4,5), body (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) tail.\n\n(3,2) is still there.\n\nThe body moves slowly; the segment at (3,2) will move to (3,3) or something only when the snake moves.\n\nAfter each move, the body shifts.\n\nAfter turn 27 to (3,5), the position that was (3,2) is still there, but index changes.\n\nAfter turn 27: segments: (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\n(3,2) is occupied.\n\nAfter turn 28, move to (4,5), new segments: (4,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) tail (6,1 removed)\n\n(3,2) still occupied.\n\nIt takes several moves for the body to move away from (3,2).\n\nSpecifically, the segment at (3,2) will only move when the tail end reaches it, but it shifts each move.\n\nFor example, after a few moves, when the snake has moved, the (3,2) position will be vacated.\n\nBut it might take many turns, and in the meantime, I might not be able to reach (3,1) quickly.\n\nFor instance, after 4 moves, the body might have moved, but the head is far.\n\nSo not efficient.\n\nTherefore, the left-down path is probably the best to eat (3,1) soon.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nTurn 27: move L to (2,4)\n\nThen turn 28: move D to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 29: move D to (2,2)\n\nThen turn 30: move D to (2,1)\n\nThen turn 31: move R to (3,1) to eat.\n\nBut on turn 31, I eat, so for planning, I can output up to turn 31 or so.\n\nBut I need to think 5+ turns ahead, so for turn 27 to 31 or 32.\n\nSince the food is eaten on turn 31, I can stop there or continue.\n\nBut the output should include the actions.\n\nPerhaps I can start with this.\n\nBut is there a shorter way?\n\nAnother idea: on turn 27, move left to (2,4), then on turn 28, instead of down, move down later, but I need to go down.\n\nOn turn 28 from (2,4), I can move down to (2,3), as before.\n\nIf I move left to (1,4), then I can go down, but it might take longer to reach (3,1).\n\nFor example, (1,4) to (1,3) to (1,2) to (1,1) to (2,1) to (3,1), 5 moves from (2,4), worse.\n\nSo better to go down early.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is reasonable.\n\nBut let's think about risks.\n\nWhen I am at (2,2) on turn 29, or (2,1) on turn 30, the area is near walls and body.\n\nFor example, at (2,1), I can move to (2,0) wall, (1,1), (2,2), or (3,1).\n\n(2,2) is body when I am at (2,1)? After moving to (2,1), the body includes (2,2), so (2,2) is occupied, so from (2,1), I can move to (1,1) or (3,1), since (2,2) body, (2,0) wall.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) is free, I assume.\n\nThen to (3,1) is fine.\n\nNo immediate danger.\n\nAlso, the tail is at (4,1) or something, far.\n\nSo should be safe.\n\nBut after eating (3,1), the snake grows, so length 9, and I need to find more food, but for now, I can output the actions to eat this food.\n\nThe problem is to maximize score, so eating this food is good.\n\nPerhaps there is negative food, but not in this state.\n\nSo I think this is the plan.\n\nBut the head direction: when I move left on turn 27 from (3,4) to (2,4), direction becomes L.\n\nThen on turn 28, move down to (2,3), which is not reverse, so ok, direction D.\n\nThen turn 29, move down to (2,2), same direction, ok.\n\nTurn 30, move down to (2,1), same, ok.\n\nTurn 31, move right to (3,1), which is not reverse of D, so ok.\n\nAll moves legal.\n\nNow, for the output, I need to list actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe format says \"Turn t1: action\", etc.\n\nSince t1=27, I can output from turn 27 to, say, turn 31 or 32.\n\nBut turn 31 is when I eat, so perhaps up to there.\n\nI can think beyond, but for now, this should be fine.\n\nTo think 5 turns ahead, from turn 27 to 32.\n\nBut after eating, I need to move on.\n\nBut I can plan the first few moves.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the other food quickly, but it's not possible.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (4,6), but it doesn't affect this path.\n\nSo I think for turn 27, move L.\n\nThen subsequent moves as above.\n\nBut let's see the answer format.\n\nI need to output the actions in a box.\n\nSo for turn 27: L\n\nTurn 28: D\n\nTurn 29: D\n\nTurn 30: D\n\nTurn 31: R\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut turn 31 is R to (3,1) to eat.\n\nThen after that, I can go somewhere.\n\nBut for the output, I can list these.\n\nTo think 5 turns, from 27 to 31 is 5 turns: 27,28,29,30,31.\n\nTurn 27 to 31 inclusive is 5 actions.\n\nTurn 27: action for turn 27\n\nTurn 28: action for turn 28\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 31.\n\nYes.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 27: L\n\nTurn 28: D\n\nTurn 29: D\n\nTurn 30: D\n\nTurn 31: R\n\nBut on turn 30, I move D to (2,1), then turn 31 R to (3,1).\n\nIn terms of the grid, after turn 30 move to (2,1), the position (3,1) is free, so on turn 31 I can move there.\n\nAnd (3,1) has food, so I eat it.\n\nLife span is enough.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nPerhaps I can move directly to (3,1) faster, but I don't see how.\n\nSo I think this is the best.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I need to plan a sequence of moves that safely reaches the positive food at (3,1) while avoiding collisions with walls, obstacles, or the snake's body. The food at (5,6) has a life span of 3, meaning it disappears after turn 29 (as the countdown decreases each turn, including turn 27). Given the distance from the current head position (3,4) to (5,6) is at least 4 moves (|3-5| + |4-6| = 4), it is impossible to reach it by turn 29. Therefore, this food is ignored.\n\nThe food at (3,1) has a life span of 8, so it remains available until after turn 34 (turn 27: L=8, turn 28: L=7, ..., turn 34: L=1, gone on turn 35). This allows ample time to reach it safely. The current head direction is \"U\" (up), so from (3,4), the possible moves are U (up), L (left), or R (right); D (down) is not allowed due to the no-instant-reverse rule.\n\nThe optimal path to (3,1) involves moving left to (2,4) on turn 27, then down for three turns to reach (2,1), and finally right to (3,1) on turn 31 to eat the food. This sequence avoids body collisions and walls, and it positions the head to eat the food on turn 31. After eating, the snake will grow to length 9, and future moves can focus on exploring for more food while avoiding risks.\n\n### Key Considerations for the Plan:\n- **Turn 27 (start at (3,4))**: Move L to (2,4) to begin pathing left and down toward the food. Direction changes to L.\n- **Turn 28 (start at (2,4))**: Move D to (2,3). Direction changes to D; no collision as (2,3) is free.\n- **Turn 29 (start at (2,3))**: Move D to (2,2). Direction remains D; (2,2) is free.\n- **Turn 30 (start at (2,2))**: Move D to (2,1). Direction remains D; (2,1) is free.\n- **Turn 31 (start at (2,1))**: Move R to (3,1) to eat the food (+1 score, length increases to 9). Direction changes to R; no collision or tail reward danger, as the tail is at (4,1) or similar and not adjacent.\n\n### Why this sequence?\n- **Safety**: All moves avoid walls (borders at x=0/7, y=0/7; obstacle at (4,6)) and body segments. For example:\n  - On turn 28, moving D to (2,3) is safe as the body is at (3,4), (3,3), etc., not (2,3).\n  - On later turns, the body shifts away from key cells like (3,1) due to movement.\n- **Efficiency**: This path reaches the food in 5 turns (turn 31), which is faster than alternatives (e.g., moving right or up first would take longer or risk dead ends).\n- **Long-term survival**: After eating, the snake can move to open areas (e.g., right or up) to avoid trapping itself in the bottom-left corner. The grid has space to manuever, and no immediate threats exist.\n\n### Looking Beyond Turn 31\nAfter turn 31, with the food eaten, the snake should head toward open areas to avoid risks:\n- From (3,1), possible moves include R (to (4,1)) or U (to (3,2)), depending on body positions. For example:\n  - Turn 32: Move U to (3,2) to start moving up and away from walls.\n  - Continue exploring the center or right side for new food spawns.\n\nThis plan prioritizes the guaranteed food at (3,1) while ensuring survival through turn 31 and beyond.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 27: L (left)  \nTurn 28: D (down)  \nTurn 29: D (down)  \nTurn 30: D (down)  \nTurn 31: R (right)  \n}",

        "step": 28,
        "score": 7,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 28, and I have to plan my moves for the next few turns to maximize the score while avoiding risks. I should think at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nThe grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) and (7,7) are corners, so walls are on the borders. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (2,4), then body segments at (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). So the snake has 8 segments. Head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to get to (2,4) from (3,4), I assume.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (5,6) with value 1 and life span 2. So it will disappear after 2 more turns, including this turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 28, life span is 2, meaning it will be there for turn 28 and 29, and disappear after turn 29 or at the start of turn 30? I need to clarify.\n\nTypically, life span means how many turns it remains, including the current turn. So if life span is N at turn t, it disappears after turn t + N - 1 or something? Let's think carefully.\n\nThe problem says: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for food at (5,6): life span 2 at turn 28. That means after turn 28, life span becomes 1; after turn 29, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 28 or 29, but not after that.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) with life span 7: will be around for 7 turns from now, so until turn 34 or something.\n\n(2,6) with life span 10: around for 10 turns.\n\nAll food has value +1, so all positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n\nNow, snake head is at (2,4), direction left. So from (2,4), possible moves: since direction is L, I can move L, U, or D, but not R because that would be instant reverse? No instant reverse rule: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n\nCurrent direction is L (left), so opposite is R (right). So I cannot move right on this turn. Possible moves: left, up, or down.\n\nBut I have to consider the grid and walls.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls on borders, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (2,4)\n\nBody: (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\nSo let's list all occupied cells by snake:\n\n- (2,4) head\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (4,2)\n\n- (4,1)\n\n- (5,1)\n\n- (6,1) tail\n\nNow, food at:\n\n- (5,6) - life span 2\n\n- (3,1) - life span 7\n\n- (2,6) - life span 10\n\n(3,1) is a food position, but (3,1) is also occupied by the snake? Let's see: snake has (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), but not (3,1). (3,1) is not listed in snake positions. Snake positions are (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). So (3,1) is not occupied by snake; it's a food cell.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) and (2,6) are free.\n\nBut (3,1) has food, and it's adjacent to the snake body? (3,1) is adjacent to (3,2) and (4,1), but (4,1) is body, (3,2) is body.\n\nNow, the special case: food can spawn under snake body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nHere, (3,1) is not under snake body; it's a separate cell. Snake doesn't occupy (3,1), so it can be eaten normally.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFirst, at turn 28, head at (2,4), direction L.\n\nPossible actions: U (up to (2,5)), D (down to (2,3)), L (left to (1,4)), or R (right to (3,4)), but R is opposite to current direction L, so cannot move R. Instant reverse not allowed.\n\nSo only U, D, L possible.\n\nNow, check if these moves are safe.\n\n- L to (1,4): is (1,4) a wall? x=1, y=4; walls are x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so (1,4) is not wall. Also not obstacle; obstacle is only (4,6). So (1,4) should be empty? But is it occupied by snake?\n\nSnake positions: (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), etc. (1,4) is not in the list, so it should be free.\n\nSimilarly, U to (2,5): (2,5) not in snake positions, not wall.\n\nD to (2,3): (2,3) not in snake positions, not wall.\n\n(2,3) might be free; let's see if any food or empty.\n\nBut for collision, moving to (1,4), (2,5), or (2,3) should be safe because they are not occupied by body or walls.\n\nNow, after moving, the snake body will follow. Since we're not eating food, length remains the same, so tail moves away.\n\nIf we eat food, length increases, so tail stays, but we need to check if we eat.\n\nCurrently, no food at (1,4), (2,5), or (2,3), I think.\n\nFood is at (5,6), (3,1), (2,6).\n\n(2,6) is food, but we're at (2,4), moving U to (2,5), not directly to (2,6).\n\nSimilarly, other moves don't reach food immediately.\n\nSo for turn 28, possible moves: L, U, D.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead to maximize score and survive.\n\nFood with short life span: (5,6) with life span 2, so it must be eaten in the next two turns, turn 28 or 29, or it disappears.\n\n(5,6) is at x=5,y=6.\n\nCurrent head at (2,4), which is not close to (5,6); it's 3 steps away in x and 2 in y, so Manhattan distance |5-2| + |6-4| = 3+2=5, so at least 5 moves away? But snake can't move diagonally, so min moves is max of dx and dy, but not necessarily.\n\nTo go from (2,4) to (5,6), need to increase x by 3 and y by 2, so min 3 moves if moving right and up, but since one move per turn, it takes at least 3 moves? Let's see possible paths.\n\nFor example, from (2,4) to (3,4) to (4,4) to (5,4) then to (5,5) to (5,6), but (5,4) to (5,5) to (5,6), that's 4 moves to reach (5,6) from (2,4): (2,4)->(3,4)->(4,4)->(5,4)->(5,5)->(5,6)? That's 5 moves, but we can go directly if possible.\n\nFrom (2,4) to (3,4) in one move, then to (4,4), then to (4,5) or (5,4), etc. But (5,6) is specific.\n\nManhattan distance is |5-2| + |6-4| = 3+2=5, so at least 5 moves away, but since we can move to adjacent cells, the number of moves is at least the max of dx and dy, which is max(3,2)=3? No, max(dx,dy) is not the min moves; min moves is max(dx,dy) only if we move diagonally, but we can't; we move orthogonally, so min moves is |dx| + |dy|, since each move changes one coordinate by 1.\n\nSo from (2,4) to (5,6), dx=3, dy=2, so min moves = 3+2=5.\n\nSimilarly, current turn 28, food disappears after turn 29, so it can be eaten on turn 28 or 29.\n\nBut to eat on turn 28, head must be at (5,6) now, but it's not; head is at (2,4), so impossible to eat on turn 28. Must be eaten on turn 29 at the latest.\n\nTo eat on turn 29, head must move to (5,6) on turn 29.\n\nThat means on turn 29, head should be at (5,6).\n\nOn turn 28, head should be at a position adjacent to (5,6), so that it can move to (5,6) on turn 29.\n\nAdjacent cells to (5,6): (5,5), (5,7), (4,6), (6,6).\n\nBut (5,7): y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n\n(6,6): x=6, y=6; x=6 is not wall? Walls: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=6 is ok, y=6 ok. But x=7 is wall, so x=6 is within bounds.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6): but (4,6) is an internal obstacle! Given: internal obstacle at (4,6), so (4,6) is wall.\n\nSo adjacent cells to (5,6):\n\n- Up: (5,7) - y=7 wall, invalid\n\n- Down: (5,5) - valid\n\n- Left: (4,6) - obstacle, invalid\n\n- Right: (6,6) - valid\n\nSo only (5,5) and (6,6) are valid adjacent cells to reach (5,6) from.\n\nTherefore, to eat (5,6) on turn 29, head must be at (5,5) or (6,6) on turn 28.\n\nCurrently, at turn 28, head is at (2,4), which is far from (5,5) or (6,6).\n\nDistance to (5,5): |5-2| + |5-4| = 3+1=4 moves.\n\nTo (6,6): |6-2| + |6-4| = 4+2=6 moves.\n\nMin moves to reach (5,5) or (6,6) from (2,4) is 4 to (5,5), but we need to be there on turn 28? No, for turn 29 eating, we need to be adjacent on turn 28.\n\nTurn 28 action: we move to a cell, then on turn 29 we move to (5,6).\n\nSo on turn 28, after move, head should be at (5,5) or (6,6).\n\nBut from (2,4), it takes multiple moves to reach (5,5) or (6,6).\n\nFor example, to reach (5,5) in one move? Impossible; min 4 moves as above.\n\nBut we have only this turn (turn 28) to get to an adjacent cell by turn 28 end.\n\nAfter turn 28 move, head position is where we move to.\n\nThen on turn 29, we move to (5,6).\n\nBut from (2,4), we can't reach (5,5) or (6,6) in one move; the closest we can get in one move is, say, to (3,4) but that's not close.\n\n(2,4) to (1,4), (2,5), or (2,3), all of which are far from (5,5).\n\n(2,5) is at distance |5-2| + |5-5| = 3+0=3 to (5,5)? |x| + |y|, from (2,5) to (5,5) is |3| + |0| = 3 moves.\n\nSimilarly, from (2,4) to (2,5) is one move, then from (2,5) to (5,5) takes at least 3 moves, so to be at (5,5) on turn 28, we need to have moved there, but we start at (2,4), so after turn 28 move, we are at one of (1,4), (2,5), (2,3), none of which is (5,5) or (6,6). So impossible to be at (5,5) or (6,6) on turn 28.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to eat the food at (5,6) on turn 29 because we cannot reach an adjacent cell by turn 28.\n\nSince we can't eat it on turn 28 (head not there), and on turn 29 we can't be adjacent to move to it, so this food cannot be eaten; it will disappear after turn 29.\n\nLife span 2 at turn 28: after turn 28, life span 1; after turn 29, life span 0, disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 28 or 29 only if head is there.\n\nBut head at (2,4) on turn 28, not at (5,6), and after turn 28 move, head at say (1,4), (2,5), or (2,3), all not (5,6), so on turn 29, from there, we might move towards it, but even if we move directly, from (2,5) to (5,6) is |3| + |1| = 4 moves, so on turn 29, after move, we might be at (3,5) or something, not (5,6). So we cannot reach (5,6) by turn 29. Therefore, this food will disappear without being eaten. So we should ignore it for now.\n\nSimilarly, other food: (3,1) and (2,6) have longer life spans, so we can plan for them.\n\n(2,6) has life span 10, so plenty of time.\n\n(3,1) has life span 7.\n\nNow, (3,1) is food, and it's at (3,1). Currently, the snake has a body segment at (3,2) and (4,1), so (3,1) is adjacent to body.\n\nBut food is not under body; it's a free cell, so we can eat it by moving head to (3,1).\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) is at (2,6), which is above head at (2,4).\n\nNow, let's list possible moves from (2,4) at turn 28: U, D, L.\n\nU to (2,5): what is here? Free, no food.\n\nD to (2,3): free, no food.\n\nL to (1,4): free, no food.\n\nAfter moving, the snake body follows. Since no food eaten, tail at (6,1) will move away, so the new tail will be at (5,1) or something, but since length same, the last segment is removed.\n\nNow, I need to think about future moves to eat food.\n\nFirst, let's consider the food at (3,1). It's close to the snake body.\n\nCurrent head at (2,4), body includes (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), then (4,2), (4,1), etc.\n\n(3,1) is at (3,1), which is below (3,2).\n\nTo eat (3,1), we need to move head to (3,1).\n\nBut head is at (2,4), so we need to get to (3,1).\n\nPossible paths: for example, from (2,4) down to (2,3), then left to (1,3)? Or down to (2,3), then down to (2,2), but that might not be efficient.\n\nFrom (2,4) to (3,1): dx=1, dy=-3, min moves 4.\n\nBut we can go through existing body or something.\n\nImportantly, (3,1) is adjacent to the tail area? Tail is at (6,1), but (3,1) is near the body.\n\nThere's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\nBut here, (3,1) has food, and tail is at (6,1), which is not adjacent to (3,1); |3-6| + |1-1| = 3, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so distance 1.\n\nTail at (6,1), adjacent cells: (5,1), (7,1), (6,2), (6,0). But (7,1) x=7 wall, (6,0) y=0 wall, so only (5,1) and (6,2) are possible, but (5,1) is occupied by body, (6,2) might be free.\n\n(3,1) is not adjacent to tail, so no immediate danger.\n\nBut when we eat (3,1), the snake will grow, so the tail won't move, but we need to ensure that after eating, we don't collide.\n\nNow, let's think about the grid layout.\n\nI should map the current state.\n\nLet me make a simple grid.\n\nRows y from 0 to 7, columns x from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all border cells except where obstacles, but walls are the cells, so x=0, x=7 for all y, y=0, y=7 for all x. Internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSo free cells are from (1,1) to (6,6), except (4,6) is obstacle.\n\nx from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, but (4,6) blocked.\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (2,4)\n\nBody: (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\nSo occupied: (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\nFood: (5,6), (3,1), (2,6)\n\n(3,1) is food, not occupied by snake, so it's a separate cell.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) and (2,6) are free.\n\nNow, (3,1) is food, and we can eat it by moving head to (3,1).\n\nBut head at (2,4), so to reach (3,1), we need to go down and left or something.\n\nPath: for example, from (2,4) D to (2,3), then D to (2,2), then L to (1,2)? But that's away from (3,1).\n\nBetter to go towards it directly.\n\nFrom (2,4) D to (2,3), then since (3,3) is body, we can't go right to (3,3), but after we move, the body moves, so when we move from (2,4) to (2,3), the head is at (2,3), then body: the segment that was at (3,4) moves to (2,4)? Let's simulate.\n\nTurn 28: suppose we move D to (2,3).\n\nThen new head position (2,3).\n\nThe body: the first body segment at (3,4) moves to where head was, (2,4).\n\nThen (3,3) moves to (3,4), (3,2) moves to (3,3), (4,2) moves to (3,2), (4,1) moves to (4,2), (5,1) moves to (4,1), (6,1) moves to (5,1), and tail at (6,1) is removed? No, since no food eaten, length same, so the last position is discarded, so new tail is where (5,1) was, but (5,1) moves to (4,1), so new positions: head (2,3), then (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) — (5,1) is now part of body, and (6,1) is gone.\n\nOriginal positions: index 0: head (2,4), 1: (3,4), 2: (3,3), 3: (3,2), 4: (4,2), 5: (4,1), 6: (5,1), 7: tail (6,1)\n\nAfter moving head down to (2,3), new head (2,3). Then body segments: segment 1 moves to previous head position (2,4), segment 2 moves to previous segment 1 position (3,4), segment 3 to (3,3), segment 4 to (3,2), segment 5 to (4,2), segment 6 to (4,1), segment 7 to (5,1). Since no growth, the last segment (tail) is removed, so new snake: positions (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1). Tail is now at (5,1).\n\nSimilarly for other moves.\n\nBut back to eating (3,1).\n\n(3,1) is food at (3,1). To eat it, we need head at (3,1).\n\nFrom current position (2,4), we can go down to (2,3), then down to (2,2), then right to (3,2), but (3,2) is currently body, but after moves, it might be free.\n\nOr we can go directly if possible.\n\nAnother way: from (2,4) we can move left to (1,4), then down to (1,3), etc., but that might be longer.\n\nSince (3,1) is below (3,2), and (3,2) is body, we need to move the body away first.\n\nFor example, if we move the head such that the body moves, and (3,1) is vacated, but (3,1) is not occupied; it's food, so we can move directly to it once the path is clear.\n\nAt turn 28, head at (2,4), (3,1) is at (3,1), which is two cells away: dx=1, dy=-3, but we can move to (3,1) in fewer moves? From (2,4) to (3,1): not adjacent, so min 2 moves if we could go diagonal, but we can't, so at least 4 moves? |1| + | -3| = 4 moves.\n\nFor example: (2,4) -> (2,3) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,1)\n\nBut (3,2) is currently occupied, but when we move to (3,2), if it's free, we can.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4) -> (3,4) but (3,4) is occupied, and we can't move right because direction is L, and R is opposite, so not allowed on this turn.\n\nOn turn 28, we can only move U, D, L, not R.\n\nSo from (2,4), we can go U to (2,5), D to (2,3), or L to (1,4).\n\nNone of which gets us closer to (3,1) directly.\n\nFor example, D to (2,3) gets us to y=3, which is closer to y=1.\n\nThen from (2,3), we can move to (2,2) or (1,3) or (3,3), but (3,3) might be occupied.\n\nLet's think about the food at (2,6).\n\n(2,6) is at (2,6), head at (2,4), so same x, dy=2, so we can go up to (2,5), then to (2,6) to eat it.\n\nBut (2,6) has life span 10, so no rush.\n\nIf we go U to (2,5) on turn 28, then on turn 29 we can go U to (2,6) and eat it.\n\nThen the snake grows, length increases.\n\nBut we need to check if it's safe.\n\nFirst, at (2,6): is it safe to move there?\n\n(2,6) is not wall, not obstacle, and currently not occupied by body. Body is at (2,4), (3,4), etc., not (2,6).\n\nAfter moving to (2,5), then to (2,6), it should be fine.\n\nBut after eating, the tail doesn't move, so we need to ensure no collision with the new tail.\n\nWhen we eat at (2,6), head moves to (2,6), and since we eat, the tail stays, so the segment that was tail remains, and we add a new head, so the snake grows by one segment.\n\nOriginal tail is at (6,1), after growth, tail will be at the same position until the next move where we don't eat.\n\nBut for collision, when head moves to (2,6), it should not collide with body except the tail, but the tail is far away, so no problem.\n\nThen the new body will include the previous positions.\n\nBut in this case, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, for (3,1), we can eat it later.\n\nBut the (5,6) food is expiring soon, but we can't reach it, so forget it.\n\nNow, another thing: the internal obstacle at (4,6), which is near (5,6), but we can't reach it anyway.\n\nNow, to maximize score, we should eat the foods, but with long-term survival.\n\nAlso, there might be risks.\n\nCurrent head position (2,4), if we move U to (2,5), that gets us closer to (2,6) food.\n\nIf we move D to (2,3), we go down, towards (3,1) but not directly.\n\nIf we move L to (1,4), we go left, away from foods.\n\n(3,1) is at (3,1), which is below, and (2,6) is above.\n\nSo moving U is towards (2,6), moving D is towards (3,1) in a way.\n\nBut (3,1) has life span 7, so no rush, while (2,6) has life span 10, also no rush.\n\nBut we should eat them to score.\n\nMoreover, after eating, we grow, which might make it harder to maneuver, but we need to survive.\n\nAnother risk: the snake body is in the bottom left area, and we are at (2,4), moving up or down.\n\nLet's consider the tail position. Tail is at (6,1), which is near the wall.\n\nIf we eat food, we grow, so the tail stays, and we might block areas.\n\nBut for now, let's plan to eat (2,6) soon.\n\nOn turn 28, move U to (2,5).\n\nThen on turn 29, move U to (2,6) to eat it.\n\nThen we grow, so length becomes 9.\n\nThen we need to move from there.\n\nBut let's think 5 turns ahead.\n\nFirst, turn 28: action\n\nThen turn 29, 30, etc.\n\nAlso, after eating (2,6), we are at (2,6), which is near the top wall y=7, but y=6, so we can move down or left/right.\n\nx=2, y=6, walls at y=7, so we can move D to (2,5), L to (1,6), or R to (3,6), but not U to (2,7) wall.\n\nBut after eating on turn 29, we need to move away.\n\nIf we don't eat (2,6) now, we can eat it later, but it's easy to eat now.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) is also available.\n\nBut let's see the life span: (5,6) expires soon, but unreachable, so ignore.\n\n(3,1) life span 7, (2,6) life span 10.\n\nSince (2,6) is very close, we can eat it immediately.\n\nOn turn 28, move U to (2,5).\n\nThen turn 29, move U to (2,6) to eat.\n\nThen on turn 29, after eating, head at (2,6), body includes previous head at (2,5), and so on.\n\nAfter turn 29 move to (2,6), since we eat, the snake grows, so positions: new head (2,6), then previous positions: before move, snake was at turn 29 start: after turn 28, we moved to (2,5), so at start of turn 29, head at (2,5), body: (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), tail (6,1) but after turn 28 move, positions: head (2,5), then (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), and tail (6,1) is gone, new tail is (5,1)? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn 28 start: positions: (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\nAfter move U to (2,5): new head (2,5), then body segments move: segment 1 to (2,4), segment 2 to (3,4), segment 3 to (3,3), segment 4 to (3,2), segment 5 to (4,2), segment 6 to (4,1), segment 7 to (5,1). Since no food, last segment (6,1) is removed, so new snake: (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) — 8 segments, tail at (5,1).\n\nNow turn 29: we move U to (2,6) to eat the food there.\n\nSince we move to (2,6) which has food, we eat it, so the snake grows. New head at (2,6), and the body: the previous positions are kept, so new snake: head (2,6), then (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) — 9 segments, tail at (5,1).\n\nNow, from (2,6), we need to move. Possible moves: D (down to (2,5)), but (2,5) is now body, so collision if we go there. L (left to (1,6)), or R (right to (3,6)).\n\n(2,5) is body, so we cannot move down to (2,5), it would be collision.\n\nSimilarly, moving to (1,6) or (3,6) should be safe.\n\n(1,6): x=1,y=6, not wall, not occupied? Currently, occupied cells: (2,6) head, (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)\n\n(1,6) is free, (3,6) is free.\n\nAlso, (3,6) might be near the obstacle, but (4,6) is obstacle, (3,6) is fine.\n\nSo on turn 29, after eating, we can move L to (1,6) or R to (3,6).\n\nNow, which one to choose? We need to think further.\n\nThere is food at (3,1), which is at (3,1).\n\nAlso, we might want to explore or avoid dead ends.\n\nAnother food is (3,1), at (3,1).\n\nFrom (2,6), if we go R to (3,6), that is away from (3,1), or L to (1,6), also away.\n\nBut we can go down later.\n\nSince we are at (2,6), we can go down to (2,5) but it's body, so not possible; we must go left or right.\n\nSuppose we go R to (3,6) on turn 29.\n\nThen new position (3,6), no food there, so no growth. Body moves: head to (3,6), then body: (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), tail at (5,1) moves to (4,1)? After move to (3,6), new head (3,6), segment 1 to previous head (2,6), segment 2 to (2,5), segment 3 to (2,4), segment 4 to (3,4), segment 5 to (3,3), segment 6 to (3,2), segment 7 to (4,2), segment 8 to (4,1), and segment 9 (tail) to (5,1)? Positions: previous snake had 9 segments: index 0: (2,6), 1: (2,5), 2: (2,4), 3: (3,4), 4: (3,3), 5: (3,2), 6: (4,2), 7: (4,1), 8: tail (5,1)\n\nAfter moving head to (3,6): new head (3,6), then segment 1 to (2,6), segment 2 to (2,5), segment 3 to (2,4), segment 4 to (3,4), segment 5 to (3,3), segment 6 to (3,2), segment 7 to (4,2), segment 8 to (4,1), and since no food, last segment (5,1) is removed, so new snake: (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1) — 9 segments? From above, after growth at turn 29, we have 9 segments.\n\nAfter moving without eating, we remove the tail, so it should be 8 segments again? No.\n\nAt turn 29 after eating: we have 9 segments.\n\nThen when we move to (3,6) without eating, we add new head (3,6), and remove the tail (5,1), so the new body is from previous position 1 to 8, but shifted.\n\nNew positions: head (3,6), then previous segments: 1: (2,6), 2: (2,5), 3: (2,4), 4: (3,4), 5: (3,3), 6: (3,2), 7: (4,2), 8: (4,1), and tail (5,1) removed. So new snake: (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1) — that's 9 positions? Let's count: 1. (3,6), 2. (2,6), 3. (2,5), 4. (2,4), 5. (3,4), 6. (3,3), 7. (3,2), 8. (4,2), 9. (4,1) — yes, 9 segments, tail at (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is now tail.\n\nSimilarly, if we had moved left instead.\n\nBut back to planning.\n\nWe also have food at (3,1) to eat.\n\n(3,1) is at (3,1), which is below (3,2).\n\nIn the current body, (3,2) is occupied, but when we move, it might change.\n\nTo eat (3,1), we need head at (3,1) when it's free.\n\nCurrently, at turn 28, if we move U to (2,5), then turn 29 eat at (2,6), then turn 30 at (3,6) or (1,6).\n\nFrom (3,6), we can move down to (3,5), then to (3,4), but (3,4) is body, etc.\n\nIt might take time to reach (3,1).\n\nIf on turn 28 we move D to (2,3), then we can go down to (2,2), etc., to reach (3,1) faster.\n\nBut (2,6) might be eaten later.\n\nSince both foods are positive, we can eat both, but we need to do it safely.\n\nAnother consideration: the area around (3,1) might be tight because of the body.\n\nFor example, (3,1) is at (3,1), adjacent cells: (3,2), (3,0), (2,1), (4,1).\n\n(3,0) y=0 wall, so invalid.\n\n(3,2) is often occupied by body.\n\n(2,1) and (4,1) might be free or occupied.\n\n(4,1) is currently body, but it moves.\n\nIf we want to eat (3,1), we need to approach from (2,1) or (4,1) or when (3,2) is free.\n\nBut (3,2) is part of the body, so it might be vacated when the snake moves.\n\nFor example, if the snake moves in a way that the segment at (3,2) moves away.\n\nBut it's complicated.\n\nPerhaps we can eat (2,6) first since it's easy and close, then worry about (3,1).\n\n(3,1) has life span 7, so after eating (2,6), we have time to go down.\n\nBut let's estimate turns.\n\nAfter eating (2,6) on turn 29, we are at (2,6).\n\nThen from there, to reach (3,1), we need to go down to y=1.\n\nFor example, from (2,6) to (2,5) but after eating, (2,5) is body, so we can't go down immediately; we must go left or right.\n\nSuppose we go R to (3,6) on turn 29.\n\nThen on turn 30, from (3,6), we can move D to (3,5), or L to (2,6) but (2,6) is body, or R to (4,6) but (4,6) obstacle, or U to (3,7) wall, so only D to (3,5) or possibly L but (2,6) body, so only D to (3,5).\n\n(3,6) to (3,5) down.\n\n(3,5) should be free.\n\nThen from (3,5) to (3,4), but (3,4) is body, so on turn 30, after moving to (3,5), body has shifted.\n\nLet's simulate from turn 29.\n\nTurn 29: after eating at (2,6), head at (2,6), body: (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)\n\nWe move R to (3,6).\n\nNew head (3,6), no food, so no growth. Body moves: segment 1 to (2,6), segment 2 to (2,5), segment 3 to (2,4), segment 4 to (3,4), segment 5 to (3,3), segment 6 to (3,2), segment 7 to (4,2), segment 8 to (4,1), tail (5,1) removed. New snake: (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1) tail at (4,1).\n\nTurn 30: from (3,6), we can move D to (3,5), since U to (3,7) wall, L to (2,6) body, R to (4,6) obstacle, so only possible move is D to (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is free, no food. Move to (3,5).\n\nNew head (3,5), body moves: segment 1 to (3,6), segment 2 to (2,6), segment 3 to (2,5), segment 4 to (2,4), segment 5 to (3,4), segment 6 to (3,3), segment 7 to (3,2), segment 8 to (4,2), tail (4,1) removed. New snake: (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2) tail at (4,2).\n\nNow at (3,5), we can move to (3,4), but (3,4) is body, or to (2,5), (4,5), or (3,6) but (3,6) is body.\n\nAdjacent cells: (3,4) down: body, (3,6) up: body, (2,5) left: let's see, (2,5) is in the body, position index 3: (2,5)? New snake: 0: (3,5), 1: (3,6), 2: (2,6), 3: (2,5), 4: (2,4), 5: (3,4), 6: (3,3), 7: (3,2), 8: (4,2)\n\nSo (2,5) is position 3, so it is body.\n\n(4,5) is right, (2,5) is left but occupied, (3,4) is down occupied.\n\n(4,5) is free? x=4,y=5, not wall, not obstacle, not in snake positions.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) occupied.\n\nSo from (3,5), possible moves: L to (2,5) but occupied, D to (3,4) occupied, U to (3,6) occupied, R to (4,5).\n\nOnly R to (4,5) is possible.\n\nMove to (4,5).\n\nNo food, so new head (4,5), body moves: segment 1 to (3,5), segment 2 to (3,6), segment 3 to (2,6), segment 4 to (2,5), segment 5 to (2,4), segment 6 to (3,4), segment 7 to (3,3), segment 8 to (3,2), tail (4,2) removed. New snake: (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) tail at (3,2).\n\nNow at (4,5), we can move to (4,4), (4,6), (5,5), or (3,5) but (3,5) is body.\n\n(4,6) is obstacle, so invalid.\n\n(3,5) left: body, (5,5) right, (4,4) down.\n\n(5,5) and (4,4) possible.\n\nAnd so on. We are moving away from (3,1), and it might take many moves to get back.\n\nIf on turn 28 we move D to (2,3), we can go towards (3,1).\n\nTurn 28: move D to (2,3).\n\nNew head (2,3), body: (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) tail (6,1) removed. New snake: (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) tail at (5,1).\n\nNow, (3,1) is at (3,1), adjacent to (3,2) which is body.\n\nTo eat (3,1), we need to move to it from an adjacent cell.\n\nAdjacent cells: (3,2), (2,1), (4,1), (3,0) wall.\n\n(3,2) is body, (4,1) is body, (2,1) might be free.\n\n(2,1) is at (2,1), which is not occupied currently.\n\nSo we can approach from (2,1).\n\nFrom current head (2,3), we can move D to (2,2), then L to (1,2)? or D to (2,2), then D to (2,1), then R to (3,1) to eat.\n\nOn turn 29, from (2,3), move D to (2,2).\n\nNew head (2,2), no food, body moves: segment 1 to (2,3), segment 2 to (2,4), segment 3 to (3,4), segment 4 to (3,3), segment 5 to (3,2), segment 6 to (4,2), segment 7 to (4,1), tail (5,1) removed. New snake: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1) tail at (4,1).\n\nTurn 30: from (2,2), move D to (2,1).\n\n(2,1) is free, no food, so move to (2,1).\n\nNew head (2,1), body moves: segment 1 to (2,2), segment 2 to (2,3), segment 3 to (2,4), segment 4 to (3,4), segment 5 to (3,3), segment 6 to (3,2), segment 7 to (4,2), tail (4,1) removed. New snake: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2) tail at (4,2).\n\nNow at (2,1), we can move to (3,1) to eat the food, since (3,1) is adjacent and has food.\n\nMove R to (3,1) on turn 31.\n\nThen eat, so new head (3,1), body: previous positions, so new snake: head (3,1), then (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2) and tail stays, so 9 segments, tail at (4,2).\n\nThen we need to move from (3,1).\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,2) but (3,2) is body, so collision; L to (2,1) body; R to (4,1); D to (3,0) wall.\n\nR to (4,1) might be possible, but (4,1) is not occupied? In new snake, positions: (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2)\n\n(4,1) is not occupied, so we can move R to (4,1).\n\nThen no food, so body moves, tail moves away.\n\nBut at turn 31, when we move to (3,1), (3,2) is body, so we cannot move up; only right to (4,1) or left/down not possible.\n\nSo it's safe to move right.\n\nIn this path, we eat (3,1) on turn 31.\n\nIf we had gone for (2,6) first, we might eat it on turn 29, but then (3,1) later.\n\nBut in terms of turns, with this down move, we eat (3,1) by turn 31.\n\nWith up move, we eat (2,6) on turn 29, but then (3,1) later, say around turn 35 or something.\n\nBut since (3,1) has life span 7 from turn 28, so at turn 28, life span 7, so it can be eaten until turn 34 or so? Life span 7 at turn 28: after turn 28, life span 6; ... after turn 34, life span 0, disappears. So can be eaten on turns 28 to 34 inclusive? Let's calculate.\n\nLife span N at turn t: it disappears after N turns, meaning at the end of turn t + N - 1 or something.\n\nThe problem: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\".\n\nAt turn t, life span N, then after turn t, it becomes N-1; after turn t+1, N-2, ... after turn t + N - 1, it becomes 0 and disappears.\n\nSo it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + N - 1.\n\nFor (3,1) at turn 28, life span 7, so can be eaten on turns 28,29,30,31,32,33,34. Disappears after turn 34.\n\nSimilarly for (2,6), life span 10, turns 28 to 37.\n\nSo we have time for both.\n\nBut in the down path, we eat (3,1) on turn 31, which is fine.\n\nIn the up path, we eat (2,6) on turn 29, then (3,1) later.\n\nBut in the up path, after eating (2,6), we might have difficulty reaching (3,1) because of the body position.\n\nIn the down path, by moving down, we eat (3,1) quickly and safely.\n\nMoreover, after eating (3,1), we can go for (2,6) later.\n\n(2,6) is at (2,6), which is still available.\n\nAfter eating (3,1) at turn 31, we are at (3,1), then we can move to (4,1), then up, etc.\n\nBut let's see the head direction.\n\nOn turn 28, if we move D to (2,3), direction becomes D.\n\nThen turn 29 move D to (2,2), direction D.\n\nTurn 30 move D to (2,1), direction D.\n\nTurn 31 move R to (3,1) to eat, direction R.\n\nThen from (3,1), we can move R to (4,1), since (3,2) is body and up not possible, down wall, left body.\n\n(4,1) should be free.\n\nThen from there, we can go up to (4,2), but (4,2) might be body, etc.\n\nBut to reach (2,6), we need to go up.\n\nSince we are at (3,1), to (2,6), dx=-1, dy=5, min moves 6.\n\nWith life span 10, we have time.\n\nBut in the initial choice, if we move U on turn 28, we eat (2,6) on turn 29, which is sooner, and (2,6) might be riskier if we delay because we are near the top, but with life span 10, it should be fine.\n\nAnother risk: in the down path, when we go to (2,1), it is near the bottom wall, but we can move right.\n\nBut let's consider the \"Tail Reward Danger\".\n\nFor (3,1), when we eat it, the head is at (3,1), and tail is at (4,2) or something, not adjacent, so no problem.\n\nSimilarly for (2,6).\n\nBut there is a point: in the body, near (3,1), there is (3,2), which is body, but when we eat (3,1), we grow, so the segment at (3,2) remains, but head is at (3,1), so they are adjacent, but it's not a collision because we just moved there; collision is when head moves to a body cell, but in this case, when we move to (3,1), it was not body before, and after moving, (3,2) is body, but we are not moving into it; we are at (3,1), which is new position.\n\nThe danger is when eating food that is under the tail or something, but here it's fine.\n\nThe specific danger is: if head is adjacent to tail, and the tail cell has food, eating it causes collision because after growth, the new tail is where head was, and head moves to tail, but since tail moves, it might not be issue.\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn this case, for (3,1), tail is at (5,1) or later at (4,2), not adjacent to (3,1), so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, for (2,6), tail is at (5,1) or (6,1), far away.\n\nSo no danger.\n\nTherefore, both options seem ok, but to maximize score quickly, eating (2,6) on turn 29 gives +1 now, while eating (3,1) on turn 31 gives +1 later.\n\nBut also, by eating (3,1) first, we might have the body in a better position or something.\n\nBut let's see the board.\n\nThe internal obstacle at (4,6) might affect movement.\n\nSince we have to think long-term, perhaps we should eat the close food first.\n\nBut (2,6) is at (2,6), which is near the top, and after eating, we are at (2,6), which has limited moves, as we saw earlier, only left or right.\n\nWhereas (3,1) is at bottom, also limited moves.\n\nBut in terms of survival, the center might be safer.\n\nAnother idea: if we move L on turn 28 to (1,4), then we go left, which is open space, and we can avoid the body cluster.\n\nFor example, move L to (1,4), then we can go to (1,5) or (1,3), etc., and later come back for food.\n\nBut the foods are at (3,1) and (2,6), so moving left might take us away.\n\n(1,4) to (2,6) is farther.\n\nSo probably not efficient.\n\nTherefore, I think moving U or D is better.\n\nNow, to decide between U and D.\n\nIf we move U, we eat (2,6) on turn 29, score +1.\n\nThen we are at (2,6), and we need to move right or left, say to (3,6), then down to (3,5), etc., and eventually down to (3,1) to eat it later.\n\nBut it might take several turns.\n\nIf we move D, we eat (3,1) on turn 31, score +1 on turn 31, then we can go for (2,6).\n\nBut (2,6) is at (2,6), from (3,1) to (2,6), we can go left to (2,1), then up to (2,2), etc., to (2,6).\n\nSimilar.\n\nBut in the U case, we get the score earlier.\n\nAlso, there is the expired food (5,6), but we can't reach it.\n\nPerhaps we should check if we can reach (5,6) but we concluded not.\n\nAnother point: on turn 28, if we move U, we are at (2,5), then on turn 29 we eat (2,6), then on turn 29 we move, say, R to (3,6), then turn 30 D to (3,5), turn 31 R to (4,5), etc., and we can go to (3,1) eventually.\n\nFrom (4,5), we can go down to (4,4), then to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut to reach (3,1), it might take many turns.\n\nFor example, from (4,5) to (3,1): dx=-1, dy=-4, min 5 moves.\n\nBut with body, it might be longer.\n\nWhereas in the D case, we eat (3,1) quickly.\n\nMoreover, after eating (3,1), the body is in the bottom, and we can move up the left side to (2,6).\n\nFor example, from (3,1) after eating, we move R to (4,1), then U to (4,2), but (4,2) might be body, but after moves, it might be free.\n\nIn the down path simulation, after eating (3,1) at turn 31, head at (3,1), body: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2) tail at (4,2).\n\nThen move R to (4,1)? (4,1) is not occupied, so move to (4,1).\n\nNo food, so new head (4,1), body moves: segment 1 to (3,1), segment 2 to (2,1), segment 3 to (2,2), segment 4 to (2,3), segment 5 to (2,4), segment 6 to (3,4), segment 7 to (3,3), segment 8 to (3,2), tail (4,2) removed. New snake: (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) tail at (3,2).\n\nThen from (4,1), we can move U to (4,2), but (4,2) is not occupied, so yes.\n\n(4,2) free, move to (4,2).\n\nThen U to (4,3), and so on, up to (4,6) but (4,6) obstacle, so to (3,6) or something.\n\nBut to reach (2,6), we can go left from (4,2) to (3,2), but (3,2) is body, so not immediately.\n\nWe need to go up and left.\n\nBut it will take time.\n\nSimilarly, in both cases, we can eat both foods, but by moving U first, we eat (2,6) sooner, by moving D first, we eat (3,1) sooner.\n\nSince the score is the same, and no immediate risk, I think moving U to eat (2,6) first is better because it's only two turns to score, and we are closer to it.\n\nMoreover, (2,6) is at the top, and after eating, we can move right and down to explore or eat other foods.\n\nBut there is only (3,1) left, and it has life span 7, so we have time.\n\nPerhaps we can create a path to eat both efficiently.\n\nBut for now, I think for turn 28, move U to (2,5).\n\nThen turn 29 move U to (2,6) to eat.\n\nThen for turn 29, after that, we need to move, say R to (3,6) or L to (1,6).\n\n(1,6) might be better because it's more open, but (3,6) is closer to the center.\n\nBut let's not specify yet.\n\nThe answer format is to list actions for multiple turns, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the output is actions for current and future turns.\n\nThe answer should be like:\n\nTurn 28: action\n\nTurn 29: action\n\netc.\n\nBut I need to decide the sequence.\n\nSince the state might change, I can plan for a few turns.\n\nBut for now, for turn 28, move U.\n\nThen turn 29 move U to eat.\n\nThen turn 30, from (2,6) after eating, move to (3,6) or (1,6).\n\nSay move R to (3,6).\n\nThen turn 31 from (3,6) move D to (3,5), as before.\n\nThen turn 32 move R to (4,5), etc.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output for turn 28 and possibly next turns.\n\nThe problem says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but \"Answer Format\" is to list actions for turns starting from t1.\n\nIt says: \"Turn \\(t_1\\): action on turn t_1 Turn \\(t_1 + 1\\): action on turn t_1 + 1 ...\"\n\nAnd \"each action ∈ {U, D, L, R}\"\n\nAlso, since it's a sequence, I should provide a few turns.\n\nBut I think for now, I'll go with moving U on turn 28.\n\nThen for turn 29, U to eat (2,6).\n\nThen for turn 30, I need to choose.\n\nBut to be complete, let's plan 5 turns.\n\nTurn 28: move U to (2,5)\n\nTurn 29: move U to (2,6) eat food\n\nThen at turn 29, after move, head at (2,6), body as before.\n\nThen move, say, R to (3,6)\n\nTurn 30: from (3,6), only possible move D to (3,5), as we saw earlier.\n\nIn the simulation, from (3,6), only D to (3,5) is possible, since other directions blocked.\n\nThen turn 31: from (3,5), only R to (4,5), as before.\n\nThen turn 32: from (4,5), we can move D to (4,4) or R to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut let's not go further.\n\nFor the answer, I can list up to turn 30 or so.\n\nBut the user might expect the sequence for the immediate turns.\n\nSince the food (3,1) is to be eaten later, I think it's fine.\n\nAnother thing: on turn 28, if we move D, we can eat (3,1) by turn 31, but we miss eating (2,6) early.\n\nBut we can eat both eventually.\n\nI think moving U is better for immediate score.\n\nMoreover, the snake head direction: after moving U, direction is U.\n\nThen on turn 29, moving U again is allowed, not reverse.\n\nIf we move D, direction D, then down again.\n\nBut no issue.\n\nI think I'll go with U for turn 28.\n\nSo action for turn 28: U\n\nThen turn 29: U to eat (2,6)\n\nThen for turn 30, since we have to specify, I'll say move R to (3,6)\n\nBut in the sequence, for the box.\n\nPerhaps I can output:\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: R  (but on turn 30, from (2,6), after turn 29 move, head at (2,6), we move R to (3,6) on turn 29? No.\n\nTurn 29 action: after state at turn 29 start, we move U to (2,6) to eat.\n\nThen for turn 30, at start, head at (2,6), we move R to (3,6).\n\nThen for turn 31, from (3,6), move D to (3,5), etc.\n\nBut for the answer, I can list a few turns.\n\nSince the problem says \"prioritize long-term survival\", moving U might bring us to the corner, but (2,6) is not corner, we can move left or right.\n\nSimilarly, moving D brings us to bottom.\n\nBut both are similar.\n\nI think U is fine.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, the AI must plan multiple turns ahead, considering the positions of food, the snake's body, walls, and obstacles. The key objectives are:\n- Eat the positive food at (2,6) quickly, as it is reachable in 2 turns from the current position and has a long life span (10 turns remaining).\n- Avoid the expiring food at (5,6), as it is unreachable within its remaining life span (2 turns).\n- Plan a path to eat the food at (3,1) after consuming (2,6), as (3,1) has a moderate life span (7 turns remaining) and is safely accessible later.\n- Ensure all moves avoid collisions with walls, obstacles, or the snake's body, and respect the no-instant-reverse rule.\n\n### Analysis of Current State (Turn 28)\n- **Snake head**: (2,4), direction left (L).\n- **Possible moves**: Up (U) to (2,5), Down (D) to (2,3), Left (L) to (1,4). Right (R) is invalid due to the no-instant-reverse rule.\n- **Food prioritization**:\n  - (5,6): Unreachable within 2 turns (Manhattan distance 5; min 5 moves required), so ignore.\n  - (2,6): Reachable in 2 turns (move U to (2,5) on turn 28, then U to (2,6) on turn 29). High priority for immediate score gain.\n  - (3,1): Reachable in ~4 turns after eating (2,6), with sufficient life span (7 turns). Lower priority than (2,6) due to distance.\n- **Risks**: \n  - Moving U to (2,5) and (2,6) is safe, as (2,5) and (2,6) are unoccupied and not walls.\n  - After eating (2,6), the head is at (2,6) with body segments below, so moving down is impossible; only left or right moves are safe.\n  - The internal obstacle at (4,6) blocks some paths but does not affect the immediate plan.\n\n### 5-Turn Plan (Turns 28 to 32)\nThe plan focuses on:\n1. Eating (2,6) on turn 29 for +1 score and growth.\n2. Moving right to (3,6) on turn 30 to avoid the body and open paths.\n3. Descending toward (3,1) for future consumption, while staying in safe areas.\n4. Ensuring survival by avoiding dead ends and maintaining maneuverability.\n\n- **Turn 28 (current turn)**: Move U to (2,5).  \n  - Why: Gets closer to (2,6) for eating next turn. Direction changes to U, allowing another U move. Avoids D (away from food) and L (inefficient, wastes time).\n  - Result: Head at (2,5), direction U. Body shifts; tail removed at (6,1). Food at (5,6) life span decreases to 1.\n\n- **Turn 29**: Move U to (2,6) to eat food.  \n  - Why: Eats (2,6) for +1 score; snake grows to length 9. Direction U maintained (not reverse). \n  - Result: Head at (2,6), direction U. Food consumed; (2,6) removed. Body grows; tail at (4,1). Food at (5,6) disappears (life span 0).\n\n- **Turn 30**: Move R to (3,6).  \n  - Why: From (2,6), moving down is blocked by body (2,5), so only L or R are safe. R is chosen to avoid the left edge and position for descending to (3,1). Direction changes to R.\n  - Result: Head at (3,6), direction R. No food eaten; tail removed at (4,1). Body shifts.\n\n- **Turn 31**: Move D to (3,5).  \n  - Why: From (3,6), U (to wall), L (to body at (2,6)), and R (to obstacle (4,6)) are invalid. Only D is safe. Direction changes to D.\n  - Result: Head at (3,5), direction D. No food eaten; tail removed. Body shifts.\n\n- **Turn 32**: Move R to (4,5).  \n  - Why: From (3,5), L (to (2,5) body), U (to (3,6) body), and D (to (3,4) body) are blocked. R is safe and starts path toward (3,1) via (4,4) or similar. Direction changes to R.\n  - Result: Head at (4,5), direction R. No food eaten; tail removed. Body shifts.\n\n### Long-Term Outlook (Beyond Turn 32)\n- **Path to (3,1)**: From (4,5), move D to (4,4) on turn 33, then continue descending (e.g., to (4,3), (4,2)) to approach (3,1) from the right. (3,1) can be eaten by turn 33-34 safely.\n- **Survival Focus**: After eating (3,1), the snake can navigate to open areas (e.g., right side) to avoid trapping itself. The plan ensures the snake stays away from walls and body clusters.\n- **Risk Mitigation**: No tail reward danger (tail is never adjacent to food when eaten). All moves are validated for collision and reversibility.\n\nThis sequence scores +1 quickly, sets up for another +1, and maintains high survivability by avoiding risks and leveraging open spaces.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: R\nTurn 31: D\nTurn 32: R\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 29. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: head at (2,5), then body segments at (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1). So the snake has 8 segments. Head direction is Up, meaning it moved up to get to (2,5) from (2,4) I assume, since it was at (2,4) before.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (5,6) with value 1 and life span 1, so it disappears after this turn if not eaten.\n\n- (3,1) with value 1 and life span 6, so it has 6 turns left including this one.\n\n- (2,6) with value 1 and life span 9, so 9 turns left.\n\nAll food has value +1, so positive food, no negative food here.\n\nI need to plan actions for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score and avoid risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake: head (2,5), body: (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1). Tail is at (5,1).\n\nFood: (5,6), (3,1), (2,6).\n\nHead direction is Up. But since the snake is moving, the direction is the current heading. From turn 28 to 29, it moved to (2,5), which is up from (2,4), so direction U is consistent.\n\nNow, possible moves from current position (2,5):\n\n- Up: to (2,6)\n\n- Down: to (2,4), but (2,4) is occupied by the body, and since it's not the tail, moving there would cause collision because the body segment won't move away yet.\n\nImportant: Collision rules. Head touches any body segment except the tail is deadly. But moving into the tail cell is safe because the tail will move forward when the snake moves, so it's vacated.\n\nIn this case, from (2,5), possible moves:\n\n- Up: (2,6) – is this safe? (2,6) has food, but let's check if it's occupied. Snake body: positions are (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), etc. (2,6) is not in the body list, so it should be empty except for possible food.\n\nFood at (2,6) is present, so moving there would eat it.\n\n- Down: to (2,4) – but (2,4) is the second segment, so it's body, not tail. Since the snake moves, when the head moves to a new cell, each segment moves to the next position, so the tail is removed. But if head moves to a body cell, it collides unless it's the tail cell.\n\nSpecifically: if head moves to a cell that will be occupied by a body segment after the move, it's collision. But the tail cell is safe because after the move, the tail moves away.\n\nCurrent positions: head (2,5), then (2,4), (3,4), etc. down to tail (5,1).\n\nIf I move down to (2,4), that cell is currently occupied by the second segment. After the move, the head would be at (2,4), and the body would shift: the first body segment moves to where the head was, (2,5), but since head is moving to (2,4), which was occupied, it's a collision because the cell (2,4) is not vacated before the head moves there? I need to think step by step.\n\nThe movement happens simultaneously: the head moves to a new cell, then each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front.\n\nSo for move down to (2,4):\n\n- Head moves to (2,4)\n\n- But (2,4) is currently occupied by the first body segment. When the head moves, it occupies (2,4), but at the same time, the first body segment should move to where the head was, (2,5). But since the head is moving to (2,4), which is already occupied, this causes a collision.\n\nGenerally, if the head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by any body segment except the tail, it's a collision. Only if it's the tail cell, it's safe because the tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, (2,4) is not the tail; tail is (5,1). So moving down to (2,4) would cause collision with the body at (2,4).\n\nSimilarly, left: to (1,5). Is (1,5) occupied? Snake positions: x=2,2,3,3,3,4,4,5; y=5,4,4,3,2,2,1,1. So (1,5) not in list, so should be free.\n\nBut x=1, y=5; grid from 0 to 7, so (1,5) is within bounds. Walls only at borders and (4,6), so (1,5) should be ok.\n\nRight: to (3,5). (3,5) not in snake positions, so free.\n\nDown we said is invalid because (2,4) is body.\n\nUp to (2,6), which has food.\n\nAlso, head direction is U, so I cannot do instant reverse, which would be down. Reverse of up is down, so I cannot move down immediately. The rule says \"cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Current direction is U, so opposite is D, so I cannot move down anyway. That makes sense.\n\nSo possible moves from (2,5) with direction U:\n\n- U: up to (2,6)\n\n- L: left to (1,5)\n\n- R: right to (3,5)\n\nCannot move D because reverse is not allowed.\n\nNow, check for walls: (2,6) is y=6, not border, x=2 not border. (1,5) x=1>0, y=5<7, not border. (3,5) similar. No internal obstacle at these points.\n\nNow, food: (2,6) has food with value 1, life span 9. If I move up, I eat it, snake grows to 9 segments.\n\n(5,6) has life span 1, so if not eaten this turn, it disappears.\n\n(3,1) has life span 6.\n\nI need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nCurrent tail is at (5,1). Head is at (2,5), not adjacent; adjacent would be same x or y differing by 1. (2,5) and (5,1) differ by 3 in x and 4 in y, not adjacent.\n\nNow, plan actions.\n\nFirst, turn 29: I need to choose an action.\n\nOption 1: Move up to (2,6) to eat the food there.\n\nThen snake grows: new positions: head at (2,6), then (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) – tail remains, but since eaten, a new segment is added, so tail stays at (5,1) for this move? When food is eaten, the snake grows, so after moving to food, the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added at the tail.\n\nStandard snake: when head eats food, it moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail stays where it is for that turn, and the snake grows.\n\nIn terms of positions: after eating, the head is at new position, and the tail doesn't advance, so the snake length increases by one.\n\nFor example, current positions: let's index: head S0=(2,5), S1=(2,4), S2=(3,4), S3=(3,3), S4=(3,2), S5=(4,2), S6=(4,1), S7=(5,1) tail.\n\nIf head moves to (2,6) and eats, then new positions: head at (2,6), then S0 becomes (2,5), S1=(2,4), S2=(3,4), S3=(3,3), S4=(3,2), S5=(4,2), S6=(4,1), and tail S7=(5,1) but since grown, a new segment is added at the tail, so now tail is still (5,1), and the segment before that is (4,1), etc. The new segment is added at the position where the tail was, so the tail position extends.\n\nAfter move: head moves to (2,6), then each body segment moves to the previous position of the one in front. But when food is eaten, the tail doesn't move; it stays, and a new segment is created there.\n\nSequence:\n\n- Head moves to new cell.\n\n- If no food eaten, tail is removed (moves forward).\n\n- If food eaten, tail is not removed; new segment added, so snake grows.\n\nIn positions:\n\n- New head position: (2,6) for move U.\n\n- Body: the first body segment moves to old head position (2,5), second to old first body position (2,4), and so on, up to the second-to-last segment moving to its new position.\n\n- Last segment (tail): if no food eaten, it is removed, so snake length same.\n\n- If food eaten, tail is not removed; it stays, and the new segment is effectively the old tail position, but since tail stays, the segment that was tail remains, and a new tail segment is not added; rather, the tail doesn't advance, so the snake has one more segment.\n\nEasier: after the move, the positions are shifted.\n\nCurrent positions: P0=head, P1, P2, ..., P7=tail.\n\nAfter moving head to new cell Q:\n\n- New head: Q\n\n- New body: P0, P1, P2, ..., P6  (if no food eaten, P7 is removed)\n\n- If food eaten at Q, then new positions: Q, P0, P1, P2, ..., P7  (P7 remains as new tail, so length +1)\n\nIn this case, if move to (2,6) and eat food, new positions: head (2,6), then (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)  -- all segments kept, so snake from (2,6) to (5,1), length 9.\n\nIf no eat, move to say (3,5), then positions: head (3,5), then (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1) -- tail at (4,1), since (5,1) removed, length 8.\n\nBack to turn 29.\n\nOption: move U to (2,6) to eat food. Food at (2,6) has life span 9, so it's safe to eat now.\n\nBut I need to consider if it's risky.\n\nAfter eating, snake is longer, which might make it harder to maneuver.\n\nAlso, there is food at (5,6) with life span 1, so if I don't eat it this turn, it disappears. But (5,6) is at x=5,y=6, which is near the obstacle.\n\nCurrent head (2,5), to (5,6) is not directly reachable in one move; I need to go through (3,5) or something.\n\nFrom (2,5), possible moves: U, L, R.\n\nIf I move R to (3,5), then I might go towards (5,6).\n\nBut (5,6) has life span 1, so only this turn to eat it.\n\nIf I move to (3,5), I don't eat anything, and (5,6) disappears after this turn.\n\nSimilarly, if I move U to (2,6), I eat that food, but (5,6) disappears.\n\nIf I move L to (1,5), no eat, (5,6) disappears.\n\nSo in all cases, since (5,6) is not adjacent to head, I cannot eat it this turn, so it will disappear after turn 29. So it's gone.\n\nSo no choice, (5,6) will be gone.\n\nNow, other food: (3,1) and (2,6).\n\n(2,6) is directly above, so I can eat it now by moving U.\n\n(3,1) is below, at tail area.\n\nBut let's think ahead.\n\nFirst, if I move U to (2,6) at turn 29:\n\n- Turn 29 action: U\n\n- New head position: (2,6)\n\n- Eat food, so snake grows: positions now: head (2,6), body (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) tail.\n\n- Head direction now U (since moved up).\n\n- Food: (5,6) disappears. (3,1) still there with life span 5 left (since turn 29, life span decreases, so was 6, after turn 29, life span 5). (2,6) eaten, removed.\n\nLife span decreases every turn including current, so for food at turn t with life span L, after turn t, if not eaten, life span L-1.\n\nAt turn 29, food (5,6) life span 1: if not eaten during turn 29, after turn it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) life span 6 at turn 29, after turn 29, if not eaten, life span 5.\n\n(2,6) life span 9, eaten.\n\nAfter turn 29, only food left is (3,1) with life span 5.\n\nNow, from new head (2,6), possible moves:\n\nDirection U, so cannot move D (down).\n\nPossible: U to (2,7), but y=7 is wall, so cannot, death.\n\nL to (1,6)\n\nR to (3,6)\n\nD down, but reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo only L or R.\n\n(2,7) is y=7, which is border wall, so invalid move, collision.\n\nSo from (2,6), moves:\n\n- U: to (2,7) wall, invalid.\n\n- L: to (1,6) - is this free? x=1,y=6, not wall, not in snake positions? Current snake: (2,6),(2,5),(2,4),etc. (1,6) not occupied, so ok.\n\n- R: to (3,6) - similarly, not occupied.\n\n- D: to (2,5), but (2,5) is now the first body segment, and since direction U, moving down is reverse, not allowed anyway.\n\nSo only L or R.\n\nIf I move L to (1,6), no food, so snake doesn't grow, tail moves: positions: head (1,6), then (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1) -- tail at (4,1), since (5,1) removed.\n\nIf move R to (3,6), similar, head (3,6), then (2,6), (2,5), etc., tail at (4,1).\n\nBut there is food at (3,1), which is at (3,1), currently occupied? Snake has (4,1) and (5,1), but (3,1) is not in positions now. After turn 29, if no move to eat, positions don't include (3,1), so it's free, but has food.\n\n(3,1) is a cell with food, and it can be eaten if head moves there, but only if not occupied by body, which it isn't.\n\nBut currently, after turn 29, head at (2,6), which is far from (3,1).\n\nI need to plan multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps moving up to (2,6) is not good because from there, I can only go left or right, and going up is wall, so I might get trapped.\n\nFor example, if I move to (2,6) and eat, then I have to go L or R.\n\nSay I go L to (1,6).\n\nThen turn 30: at (1,6), direction L (since moved left).\n\nThen possible moves: from (1,6), direction L.\n\nCannot move R (reverse).\n\nU to (1,7) - y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nD to (1,5) - possible, since not wall, and not occupied? After move to (1,6), positions: head (1,6), then (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1) tail at (4,1).\n\n(1,5) is free? Not in positions, so yes.\n\nL to (0,6) - but x=0 is wall, invalid.\n\nSo only D to (1,5) or possibly R, but cannot reverse.\n\nMoves: U: (1,7) wall\n\nD: (1,5)\n\nL: (0,6) wall\n\nR: (2,6) but (2,6) is body, and moving right to (2,6) which is occupied by first body segment, collision, and also reverse not allowed since direction is L, moving R is opposite.\n\nSo only possible move is D to (1,5).\n\nThen turn 30: move D to (1,5)\n\nNew head (1,5), body: (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2) tail at (4,2)? After move, no eat, so tail removed: positions head (1,5), then (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2) -- tail at (4,2), since (4,1) removed? Let's list:\n\nAfter turn 29: positions A: (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) but since no eat on turn 30? Turn 30 move.\n\nAfter turn 29: snake at (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1) length 9.\n\nTurn 30: move to (1,6), but (1,6) is not food, so no eat. Head moves to (1,6), body: (2,6) moves to old head? New positions: head (1,6), then (2,6) moves to where head was, but head was (2,6), so (2,6) becomes body, then (2,5) moves to (2,6)? Standard: the body segments shift.\n\nNew head: (1,6)\n\nThen the segment that was at (2,6) moves to (1,6)? No.\n\nWhen head moves to new cell, the first body segment moves to the old head position, second to old first body position, etc.\n\nOld positions: H: (2,6), B1: (2,5), B2: (2,4), B3: (3,4), B4: (3,3), B5: (3,2), B6: (4,2), B7: (4,1), T: (5,1)\n\nHead moves to (1,6)\n\nThen new positions:\n\n- New head: (1,6)\n\n- New B1: old head position (2,6)\n\n- New B2: old B1 position (2,5)\n\n- New B3: old B2 position (2,4)\n\n- New B4: old B3 position (3,4)\n\n- New B5: old B4 position (3,3)\n\n- New B6: old B5 position (3,2)\n\n- New B7: old B6 position (4,2)\n\n- New tail: old B7 position (4,1)  -- since no food, tail advances, (5,1) is removed.\n\nSo positions: (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1)  tail at (4,1)\n\nThen from (1,6), move D to (1,5), as only choice.\n\nTurn 31: at (1,5), direction D (since moved down).\n\nThen possible moves:\n\nCannot move U (reverse).\n\nL to (0,5) x=0 wall\n\nR to (2,5) -- (2,5) is now occupied by B2? Current positions: head (1,5), B1 (1,6), B2 (2,6), B3 (2,5), etc. (2,5) is B3, body segment.\n\nMoving to (2,5) would be collision.\n\nD to (1,4) -- possible, not occupied.\n\nU not allowed.\n\nSo only D to (1,4) or R, but R to (2,5) is body, collision.\n\nSo must move D to (1,4).\n\nThen turn 31: move D to (1,4)\n\nNo food, so positions: head (1,4), then (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) tail at (3,2)? Old tail (4,1) removed.\n\nList:\n\nOld: H(1,5), B1(1,6), B2(2,6), B3(2,5), B4(2,4), B5(3,4), B6(3,3), B7(3,2), T(4,1)? After turn 30, positions were (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1) so H(1,6), B1(2,6), B2(2,5), B3(2,4), B4(3,4), B5(3,3), B6(3,2), B7(4,2), T(4,1)\n\nMove to (1,5): head to (1,5), then B1 to old H (1,6), B2 to old B1 (2,6), B3 to old B2 (2,5), B4 to old B3 (2,4), B5 to old B4 (3,4), B6 to old B5 (3,3), B7 to old B6 (3,2), tail to old B7 (4,2) -- T(4,2)\n\nPositions: (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2) tail (4,2)? B7 is (3,2), tail is (4,2)\n\nThen move to (1,4): head to (1,4), no food, so B1 to (1,5), B2 to (1,6), B3 to (2,6), B4 to (2,5), B5 to (2,4), B6 to (3,4), B7 to (3,3), tail to (3,2) -- (4,2) removed.\n\nSo now head at (1,4), and I'm stuck in the corner, with body around, and food at (3,1) which is below, but I have to go down to (1,3), etc., and the snake is long, might trap myself.\n\nIf from (2,6) I move R instead of L.\n\nTurn 29 move U to (2,6)\n\nThen turn 30, from (2,6) direction U, but only L or R possible.\n\nMove R to (3,6)\n\nThen positions: head (3,6), then (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1) tail (4,1) since no eat.\n\nThen from (3,6), direction R (since moved right).\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,7) y=7 wall\n\nD to (3,5) -- possible\n\nL to (2,6) -- but (2,6) is body, collision, and reverse not allowed.\n\nR to (4,6) -- but (4,6) is internal obstacle! Wall at (4,6), so invalid.\n\nSo only possible move D to (3,5)\n\nThen turn 30: move D to (3,5)\n\nNo food, positions: head (3,5), then (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2) tail (4,2)? Old tail (4,1) removed.\n\nList: after move to (3,6): positions (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1)\n\nHead to (3,5), no eat, so B1 to old H (3,6), B2 to old B1 (2,6), B3 to old B2 (2,5), B4 to old B3 (2,4), B5 to old B4 (3,4), B6 to old B5 (3,3), B7 to old B6 (3,2), tail to old B7 (4,2) -- (4,1) removed.\n\nPositions: (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2) tail (4,2)\n\nFrom (3,5), direction D (moved down).\n\nThen possible moves: cannot move U (reverse).\n\nD to (3,4) -- but (3,4) is now B5? Positions: B1(3,6), B2(2,6), B3(2,5), B4(2,4), B5(3,4), etc. (3,4) is B5, body segment, so moving to (3,4) collision.\n\nL to (2,5) -- (2,5) is B3, body, collision.\n\nR to (4,5) -- possible, not occupied.\n\nU not allowed.\n\nSo only R to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 31: move R to (4,5)\n\nNo food, positions: head (4,5), then (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) tail at (3,2)? Old tail (4,2) removed.\n\nAnd so on. I'm moving right, but there's the obstacle at (4,6), so I need to avoid that.\n\nBut the point is, by moving up to (2,6) at turn 29, I am forced into a corner or a path with few options, and the snake is long, so I might not be able to reach the other food at (3,1) easily.\n\nMoreover, (3,1) has life span 5, so I have 5 turns to eat it, but from (2,6), it's at (3,1), which is far, and with the snake body, it might be tricky.\n\nPerhaps better not to eat (2,6) now and instead go for a different path.\n\nAt turn 29, instead of moving U, I could move L or R.\n\nFirst, move L to (1,5)\n\nTurn 29 action: L to (1,5)\n\nNo food, so snake length 8: positions head (1,5), then (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1) tail (4,1)? Current after move.\n\nCurrent positions: (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1)\n\nMove head to (1,5), no eat, so new positions: head (1,5), then (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1) tail at (4,1), (5,1) removed.\n\nHead direction now L.\n\nFood: (5,6) disappears, (2,6) still there with life span 8 (was 9, after turn 29, life span 8), (3,1) life span 5.\n\nFrom (1,5), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: cannot move R (reverse).\n\nU to (1,6) -- possible\n\nD to (1,4) -- possible\n\nL to (0,5) x=0 wall, invalid\n\nSo U or D.\n\nIf U to (1,6), then can access (2,6) food later.\n\nBut (2,6) has life span 8, so time.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) below.\n\nMove R to (3,5) at turn 29.\n\nTurn 29 action: R to (3,5)\n\nNo food, positions: head (3,5), then (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1) tail (4,1)\n\nHead direction R.\n\nFood same as above.\n\nFrom (3,5), possible moves: cannot move L (reverse).\n\nU to (3,6) -- possible\n\nD to (3,4) -- but (3,4) is body, currently occupied? Positions: head (3,5), B1 (2,5), B2 (2,4), B3 (3,4), B4 (3,3), etc. (3,4) is B3, body segment, so moving to (3,4) collision.\n\nR to (4,5) -- possible\n\nL not allowed.\n\nSo U or R.\n\nU to (3,6) or R to (4,5).\n\n(3,6) is not food, (4,5) not food.\n\nBut (2,6) food at (2,6), which is adjacent to (3,6) or from (3,5) etc.\n\nI need to aim for the food at (3,1), which is closer to the tail.\n\n(3,1) has life span 6 at turn 29, after turn 29 life span 5, so I have until turn 34 to eat it.\n\nTurn 29: life span 6, means it can be eaten on turn 29,30,31,32,33,34? Life span decreases every turn including current.\n\nAt turn t, if life span L, it exists for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, so L turns from t to t+L-1.\n\nAt turn 29, life span 6, so it can be eaten on turn 29 to 34 inclusive, 6 turns.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) life span 9 at turn 29, can be eaten turn 29 to 37.\n\nNow, (3,1) is at the bottom, near the tail.\n\nCurrent tail is at (5,1), and (3,1) is food.\n\nIf I can move the head down to eat (3,1), but it's not adjacent.\n\nLet's see the path.\n\nFrom current head (2,5), if I move down, but I cannot, because reverse not allowed and also body collision.\n\nMove left or right.\n\nPerhaps move right to (3,5), then down is not possible because (3,4) is body.\n\nFrom (2,5), move R to (3,5), then from there, I can move U to (3,6) or R to (4,5).\n\nIf I move R to (4,5), then from (4,5), I can move down to (4,4) or right to (5,5), etc., but I need to go down to reach (3,1).\n\nBut (3,1) is at y=1, head at y=5.\n\nAlso, the body is in the way.\n\nAnother idea: since the food at (3,1) is under the body or something? Current positions: snake has (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), so (3,1) is not occupied; it's free with food.\n\nBut to eat it, the head must move to (3,1).\n\nBut the snake body is around, so I need to navigate the head to (3,1) without colliding.\n\nMoreover, after eating, the snake grows, so space might be tight.\n\nBut let's think about the tail reward danger.\n\nIf I move to eat (3,1), and the head is adjacent to the tail when the tail has food, but in this case, the food is at (3,1), and tail is at (5,1), not adjacent.\n\nBut after eating, the tail might be near.\n\nI should consider not eating the (2,6) food now to keep the snake shorter for maneuvering.\n\nAt turn 29, move R to (3,5).\n\nThen turn 29 action: R to (3,5)\n\nNo eat, positions: head (3,5), body (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1) tail (4,1) -- (5,1) removed.\n\nDirection R.\n\nFood: (5,6) gone, (2,6) life span 8, (3,1) life span 5.\n\nFrom (3,5), possible moves: U to (3,6), R to (4,5), as we said.\n\nIf I move U to (3,6), then at (3,6), direction U.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (3,7) wall, D to (3,5) body and reverse, not allowed, L to (2,6) -- (2,6) has food, and not occupied, so can move, R to (4,6) wall, so only L to (2,6).\n\nThen turn 30: move L to (2,6), eat food there.\n\nThen snake grows: positions head (2,6), then (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1) -- tail at (4,1), and new segment, so length 9.\n\nHead direction L.\n\nThen from (2,6), moves: cannot move R (reverse), U to (2,7) wall, D to (2,5) -- (2,5) is now body, occupied, collision, L to (1,6) possible.\n\nSo only L to (1,6).\n\nThen same as before, I'm forced left and down.\n\nIf from (3,5) I move R to (4,5) instead.\n\nTurn 29: move R to (3,5)\n\nThen turn 30: move R to (4,5)\n\nNo eat, positions: head (4,5), then (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1) tail (4,1)? After move to (4,5), no eat, so B1 to (3,5), B2 to (2,5), B3 to (2,4), B4 to (3,4), B5 to (3,3), B6 to (3,2), B7 to (4,2), tail to (4,1) -- (4,1) is tail, but not removed? Positions: head (4,5), B1 (3,5), B2 (2,5), B3 (2,4), B4 (3,4), B5 (3,3), B6 (3,2), B7 (4,2), T (4,1)\n\nDirection R.\n\nFrom (4,5), possible moves: U to (4,6) but (4,6) is wall, invalid.\n\nD to (4,4) possible, not occupied.\n\nL to (3,5) body, occupied and reverse not allowed.\n\nR to (5,5) possible.\n\nSo U or R, but U wall, so only D or R.\n\nD to (4,4) or R to (5,5).\n\nNow, I can go down towards (3,1).\n\nFor example, move D to (4,4).\n\nTurn 31: at (4,4), direction D.\n\nThen can move D to (4,3), L to (3,4), R to (5,4), etc.\n\n(3,1) is at (3,1), so I need to go to y=1.\n\nFrom (4,4), move L to (3,4), but (3,4) is body, currently B4, occupied, so collision.\n\nMove D to (4,3), then to (4,2), but (4,2) is B7, body, occupied.\n\nPositions: after turn 30, positions are (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1)\n\nFrom (4,5) move D to (4,4), no food, so positions: head (4,4), then (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2) tail at (4,2), (4,1) removed? Tail was (4,1), removed, so new tail (4,2).\n\nPositions: H(4,4), B1(4,5), B2(3,5), B3(2,5), B4(2,4), B5(3,4), B6(3,3), B7(3,2), T(4,2)\n\nNow (4,2) is tail.\n\nFrom (4,4), move to (4,3): possible, not occupied.\n\nThen head to (4,3), no food, positions: H(4,3), B1(4,4), B2(4,5), B3(3,5), B4(2,5), B5(2,4), B6(3,4), B7(3,3), T(3,2) -- tail at (3,2)\n\nThen from (4,3), can move to (4,2), but (4,2) is not tail now; tail is at (3,2). (4,2) is free? Not occupied, so can move to (4,2).\n\nBut (4,2) has no food, or to (3,3) or (5,3), etc.\n\nBut (3,1) is at (3,1), so from (4,2) or something.\n\nThis is taking too long. I need to think strategically.\n\nThe food at (3,1) is critical because it has shorter life span, only 5 turns left after turn 29, so I should prioritize eating it soon.\n\n(2,6) has longer life span, so I can eat it later.\n\nAlso, the snake is currently at the top, (2,5), and (3,1) is at bottom left.\n\nTo reach (3,1), I need to move down and left.\n\nBut from (2,5), I can't move down directly.\n\nSo best to move left or right to position for down move.\n\nIf I move left to (1,5) at turn 29.\n\nThen from (1,5), I can move down to (1,4) or up to (1,6).\n\nIf I move down to (1,4), then to (1,3), etc., to go down to y=1, but x=1, while (3,1) is at x=3, so I need to go right later.\n\nFrom (1,5) move U to (1,6), then I can go to (2,6) to eat food, but as before, might trap myself.\n\nPerhaps move right to (3,5) at turn 29, then from there, since I can't move down, move right to (4,5), then down to (4,4), etc., to reach (4,1) or near, then go left to (3,1).\n\nBut (3,1) is at (3,1), and the tail is near, so I need to be careful not to collide.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (3,1) is on a cell that might be under the body, but currently, it's not occupied, so it can be eaten if head moves there.\n\nBut to do that, I need the head to be able to move to (3,1).\n\nFrom the current state, after turn 29, if I don't eat, positions are shorter.\n\nLet's list the grid for clarity.\n\nGrid 8x8, walls at borders and (4,6).\n\nTurn 29:\n\nHead: (2,5) direction U\n\nFood: (5,6) - gone after this turn\n\n(3,1) - value 1, life 6\n\n(2,6) - value 1, life 9\n\nI think the best action at turn 29 is to move right to (3,5), to position for moving down later.\n\nThen at turn 30, from (3,5), move right to (4,5), to avoid the body at (3,4).\n\nThen from (4,5), move down to (4,4), then to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut to reach (3,1), from (4,3), I can move left to (3,3), but (3,3) might be body.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nTurn 29 action: R to (3,5)\n\nPositions: head (3,5), body (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1) tail (4,1)\n\nDirection R\n\nFood: (2,6) life span 8, (3,1) life span 5\n\nTurn 30: from (3,5), move R to (4,5) (since U to (3,6) is possible but not necessary, and R to (4,5) is better for down)\n\nMove R to (4,5)\n\nPositions: head (4,5), then (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1) tail (4,1)\n\nDirection R\n\nFrom (4,5), move D to (4,4) (since U to (4,6) wall, L to (3,5) body and reverse, not allowed, R to (5,5) possible but not down, so D to (4,4) for down direction)\n\nTurn 31 action: D to (4,4)\n\nNo food, positions: head (4,4), then (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2) tail (4,2)\n\nDirection D\n\nNow (3,1) is at (3,1), so I need to go to x=3, y=1.\n\nFrom (4,4), I can move L to (3,4), but (3,4) is body, currently B5?

Positions: B7 is (3,2), T is (3,2)? After move to (4,3), positions: H(4,3), B1(4,4), B2(4,5), B3(3,5), B4(2,5), B5(2,4), B6(3,4), B7(3,3), T(3,2)\n\n(4,2) is free, so move to (4,2)\n\nTurn 33: move to (4,2)\n\nNo food, positions: head (4,2), then (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3) tail (3,3)\n\nDirection D? Moved to (4,2) from (4,3), so direction D.\n\nFrom (4,2), can move L to (3,2) but (3,2) is not occupied? Positions: B7(3,3), T(3,3)?

Moved from (4,2) to (3,2), so left, direction L.\n\nFrom (3,2), can move D to (3,1) which has food! And it's turn 34, life span of (3,1) was 6 at turn 29, so at turn 34, it can be eaten if life span not expired.\n\nLife span at turn 29: 6, so exists until turn 29+6-1=34? Turns: at turn t, life span L, it exists from turn t to t+L-1.\n\nTurn 29: L=6, so exists on turns 29,30,31,32,33,34. Turn 34 is the last turn it can be eaten.\n\nTurn 34: move to (3,1), eat food.\n\nThen snake grows.\n\nBut is it safe? Head at (3,2), move D to (3,1), which is down.\n\nDirection from (3,2) to (3,1) is down.\n\n(3,1) has food, so eat.\n\nNew positions: head (3,1), then (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) and since eaten, tail remains, so positions: (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) tail at (3,4)\n\nLength 10.\n\nAnd head direction D.\n\nNow, from here, I can continue, and there is still food at (2,6) to eat later.\n\nIn this plan, I ate the (3,1) food just in time at turn 34.\n\nNow for turn 29, I need to start with move R to (3,5).\n\nThen turn 30 move R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 31 move D to (4,4)\n\nTurn 32 move D to (4,3)\n\nTurn 33 move to (4,2)? In the sequence, at turn 33 I moved to (4,2), but from (4,3) to (4,2) is down, same as before.\n\nIn turn 33, from (4,3) I moved to (4,2), which is D.\n\nThen turn 34 from (4,2) to (3,2) L, then turn 35 to (3,1) D, but turn 34 is move to (3,2), turn 35 to (3,1).\n\nBut food (3,1) must be eaten by turn 34.\n\nIn my earlier, turn 34: move to (3,1)\n\nBut in the sequence:\n\nTurn 29: move R to (3,5)\n\nTurn 30: move R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 31: move D to (4,4)\n\nTurn 32: move D to (4,3)\n\nTurn 33: from (4,3) move to (4,2) D\n\nAt turn 33, positions: after turn 32, head at (4,3), positions H(4,3), B1(4,4), B2(4,5), B3(3,5), B4(2,5), B5(2,4), B6(3,4), B7(3,3), T(3,2)\n\nMove to (4,2): head to (4,2), no food, so B1 to (4,3), B2 to (4,4), B3 to (4,5), B4 to (3,5), B5 to (2,5), B6 to (2,4), B7 to (3,4), tail to (3,3) -- T(3,2) removed?

(3,2) is not occupied, free. Move L to (3,2)\n\nBut (3,2) is not food; food is at (3,1).\n\nMove to (3,2), no eat.\n\nPositions: head (3,2), then (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) tail at (3,4) -- T(3,3) removed?

Turn 34 is the last; after turn 34, it disappears, so on turn 35, it is gone. Cannot eat on turn 35.\n\nMistake.\n\nTurn 34 is the last turn to eat (3,1).\n\nAt turn 34, head must be at (3,1).\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 34, head is at (4,2), and I move to (3,2), not to (3,1).\n\nFrom (4,2) at turn 34, I can move directly to (3,1)? (3,1) is at x=3,y=1, from (4,2) to (3,1) is not adjacent; adjacent would be same x or y differing by 1. (4,2) to (3,1) is diagonal, not allowed; must move horizontal or vertical.\n\nSo from (4,2), possible moves: U to (4,3) body, D to (4,1) possible? y=1, not wall, not occupied, L to (3,2) as above, R to (5,2) possible.\n\nCannot move directly to (3,1).\n\nAt turn 34, head at (4,2), I can only move to (4,1), (3,2), or (5,2), not to (3,1).\n\n(3,1) is at turn 34, but I can't reach it from (4,2) in one move.\n\nFrom earlier, at turn 33, head at (4,3), I can move to (3,3) or (4,2), but (3,3) is body, occupied, so I moved to (4,2).\n\nAt turn 32, head at (4,4), I moved to (4,3), but I could have moved to (5,4) or something, but not towards (3,1).\n\nPerhaps from the beginning, at turn 29, instead of moving right, move left to (1,5), then down to (1,4), etc., to reach (3,1) faster.\n\nTurn 29: move L to (1,5)\n\nPositions: head (1,5), body (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1) tail (4,1)\n\nDirection L\n\nTurn 30: from (1,5), move D to (1,4) (since U to (1,6) possible but not down)\n\nMove D to (1,4)\n\nPositions: head (1,4), then (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1) tail (4,1)\n\nDirection D\n\nTurn 31: move D to (1,3)\n\nPositions: head (1,3), then (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2) tail (4,2) -- (4,1) removed\n\nDirection D\n\nTurn 32: move D to (1,2)\n\nPositions: head (1,2), then (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) tail (3,2)\n\nDirection D\n\nTurn 33: move D to (1,1)\n\nBut y=1, not wall, positions: head (1,1), then (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3) tail (3,3)\n\nDirection D\n\nNow at (1,1), I can move R to (2,1) or U to (1,2) body, etc.\n\nMove R to (2,1)\n\nTurn 34: move R to (2,1)\n\nNo food, positions: head (2,1), then (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) tail (3,4)\n\nDirection R\n\nThen from (2,1), move R to (3,1) to eat food.\n\nTurn 35: move R to (3,1)\n\nBut turn 35, food (3,1) life span expired; it disappeared after turn 34.\n\nAt turn 34, head at (2,1), can move to (3,1) to eat.\n\nTurn 34: move to (3,1) from (2,1)\n\nBut at turn 34, from (2,1), move R to (3,1), eat.\n\nLife span: turn 34 is within the range, since from turn 29 to 34.\n\nYes, turn 34 is ok.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nTurn 29: move L to (1,5)\n\nTurn 30: move D to (1,4)\n\nTurn 31: move D to (1,3)\n\nTurn 32: move D to (1,2)\n\nTurn 33: move D to (1,1)\n\nTurn 34: move R to (3,1)? From (1,1) to (3,1) not adjacent; must move one step.\n\nAt turn 33, head at (1,1), move to (2,1) or (1,0) wall or (0,1) wall.\n\nMove R to (2,1)\n\nTurn 34: from (2,1), move R to (3,1), eat food.\n\nYes, on turn 34.\n\nPositions after: head (3,1), then (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) and since eaten, tail remains (3,4), so positions: (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) tail (3,4)\n\nLength 10.\n\nThen I can go up or right to eat the other food later.\n\nThis seems better than the first approach.\n\nAnd I didn't eat the (2,6) food, so snake is shorter until I eat (3,1).\n\nAt turn 29, by moving left, I avoided the risk of getting stuck at the top.\n\nThen after eating (3,1), I can plan to eat (2,6) which has more time.\n\nAlso, in this case, I used the left side to go down, which was clear.\n\nSo for turn 29, action L.\n\nThen the actions:\n\nTurn 29: L\n\nTurn 30: D\n\nTurn 31: D\n\nTurn 32: D\n\nTurn 33: D to (1,1)\n\nTurn 34: R to (3,1) via (2,1), so move R to (2,1) on turn 33, then R to (3,1) on turn 34.\n\nIn the sequence above.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions from turn 29 onwards for a few turns, at least 5.\n\nSince I have a plan, I can output up to turn 34.\n\nBut let's confirm the head direction.\n\nIn turn 29, move L to (1,5), direction L.\n\nTurn 30, move D to (1,4), direction D.\n\nTurn 31, move D to (1,3), direction D.\n\nTurn 32, move D to (1,2), direction D.\n\nTurn 33, move D to (1,1), direction D.\n\nTurn 34, move R to (2,1), direction R.\n\nBut at turn 34, from (1,1), I move to (2,1), which is right, so direction R.\n\nThen to (3,1) on turn 35? No, on turn 34 I moved to (2,1), then on turn 35 to (3,1), but turn 34 is the last for food.\n\nAt turn 34, head at (1,1), I move to (2,1), not directly to (3,1).\n\nBut (3,1) can be eaten on turn 34 if head is there.\n\nAt turn 34, head is at (2,1) after move, not at (3,1).\n\nIn my sequence:\n\n- Turn 33: head at (1,1) after move.\n\n- Turn 34: move from (1,1) to (2,1), head at (2,1) at the end of turn 34.\n\nBut to eat (3,1), I need head at (3,1) during turn 34.\n\nWhen I move to (2,1) on turn 34, (3,1) is not eaten.\n\nThen on turn 35, I can move to (3,1), but food gone.\n\nMistake in timing.\n\nTurn 34 action: from head position at start of turn 34, which is (1,1), I move to a new cell.\n\nIf I move to (3,1), but not adjacent.\n\nSo I can only move to adjacent cells.\n\nFrom (1,1), I can only move to (2,1) or (1,2), etc., not directly to (3,1).\n\nSo on turn 34, I cannot reach (3,1) from (1,1).\n\nThe only way to eat on turn 34 is to be at (2,1) or (3,2) or (4,1) or (3,0) invalid, so adjacent cells to (3,1) are (3,2), (3,0) wall, (2,1), (4,1).\n\nFrom previous positions, at turn 33, head is at (1,1), which is not adjacent to (3,1).\n\nAt turn 32, head at (1,2), which is not adjacent.\n\nAt turn 31, head at (1,3), not adjacent.\n\nAt turn 30, head at (1,4), not.\n\nAt turn 29, head at (1,5), not.\n\nSo from the left path, I cannot reach (3,1) by turn 34; the earliest is turn 35, but too late.\n\nTherefore, the only way is the first path I thought, moving right to reach (3,1) by turn 34.\n\nIn the right move path:\n\nTurn 29: move R to (3,5)\n\nTurn 30: move R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 31: move D to (4,4)\n\nTurn 32: move D to (4,3)\n\nAt turn 32, head at (4,3)\n\nFrom (4,3), at turn 33, I can move L to (3,3) but (3,3) is body, occupied, as in earlier calculation.\n\nIn positions after turn 32: head at (4,3), body (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) tail (3,2)\n\n(3,3) is B7, occupied.\n\nMove D to (4,2) as I did.\n\nBut (4,2) is free.\n\nThen at turn 33, head at (4,2), move to (3,2) L.\n\n(3,2) is tail? In positions, tail is at (3,2), so moving to (3,2) is safe because it's the tail cell.\n\nTail reward danger only if tail has food and head adjacent, but here tail at (3,2), no food, so moving to tail cell is safe.\n\nMove to (3,2) on turn 33.\n\nTurn 33: move L to (3,2)\n\nSince (3,2) is tail, no collision, and no food there, so no eat.\n\nPositions: head (3,2), then (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) tail at (3,4) -- old tail (3,2) removed, so new tail (3,4)? Positions: after move, head to (3,2), B1 to (4,2), B2 to (4,3), B3 to (4,4), B4 to (4,5), B5 to (3,5), B6 to (2,5), B7 to (2,4), tail to (3,4)\n\nHead direction L.\n\nFrom (3,2), at turn 34, move D to (3,1) to eat food.\n\nTurn 34: move D to (3,1), eat.\n\nPerfect.\n\nAnd on turn 34, within life span.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 29: R\n\nTurn 30: R\n\nTurn 31: D\n\nTurn 32: D\n\nTurn 33: L (to (3,2))\n\nTurn 34: D (to (3,1))\n\nFor the answer, I need to output from turn 29 for at least 5 turns, so up to turn 33 or 34.\n\nBut turn 29 to 33 is 5 turns: 29,30,31,32,33.\n\nThen turn 34 is extra.\n\nSince the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", outputting 5 actions is fine.\n\nIn this plan, at turn 33, I move to (3,2), which is safe, then turn 34 eat.\n\nAlso, after that, I can go for the other food.\n\nFor turn 29, action R.\n\nNow, to confirm, at turn 29, moving R to (3,5) is valid, not wall, not body.\n\nDirection U, moving R is not reverse, ok.\n\nSimilarly, other moves.\n\nSo I think this is a good plan.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, the AI must plan at least 5 turns ahead, considering the food life spans and avoiding collisions. The current state (turn 29) has the snake head at (2,5) with direction Up. The key objectives are:\n- Eat the positive food at (3,1) with life span 6 (must be eaten by turn 34) to avoid missing the opportunity.\n- Avoid eating the food at (2,6) immediately, as it has a longer life span (9 turns) and moving up could trap the snake near the wall or in a corner.\n- The food at (5,6) disappears after this turn and is unreachable, so it is ignored.\n- The snake should navigate toward (3,1) efficiently while keeping escape routes open for future turns.\n\n### Plan for Turns 29-33 (5 turns ahead):\n- **Turn 29 (current)**: Move Right (R) to (3,5). This avoids the risk of moving up (which could trap the snake) and positions the head to move down toward (3,1). Direction changes from Up to Right, which is allowed (no instant reverse).\n- **Turn 30**: Move Right (R) to (4,5). This continues the path away from the body and toward the right side, enabling a downward turn next. Direction is now Right.\n- **Turn 31**: Move Down (D) to (4,4). This starts the descent toward y=1 where (3,1) is located. Direction changes to Down.\n- **Turn 32**: Move Down (D) to (4,3). This brings the head closer to y=1. Direction remains Down.\n- **Turn 33**: Move Left (L) to (3,2). This positions the head adjacent to (3,1) for eating on turn 34. Moving to (3,2) is safe as it is the current tail cell, and no food is present there (no tail reward danger).\n\n### Why this plan?\n- **Eats (3,1) on time**: By turn 34, the head reaches (3,1) to eat the food before it disappears (life span ends after turn 34). This scores +1 and grows the snake.\n- **Avoids risks**: \n  - Moving up on turn 29 would trap the snake near (2,6) and the wall (y=7), limiting future moves and risking collision. \n  - The path via the right and down keeps the snake away from walls and internal obstacles, with ample space to maneuver.\n  - Snake length remains 8 until turn 34, making navigation easier in tighter spaces.\n- **Long-term focus**: After eating (3,1), the snake can target (2,6) with its longer life span (still available until turn 37), ensuring future scoring opportunities. The plan ensures survival by avoiding dead ends and collisions.\n\n### Actions in Answer Format:\n\\boxed{\nTurn 29: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 30: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 31: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 32: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 33: L (left)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with an internal obstacle at (4,6). Walls include borders and obstacles, so I can't move to those cells.\n\nCurrent turn is t=30.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (3,5), then body segments: (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1). So the tail is at (4,1).\n\nSnake head direction is R, which is right, so last move was to the right.\n\nFood:\n\n- One at (3,1) with value 1 and life span 6. Since it's turn 30, this food will disappear after 6 turns, so on turn 36 it's gone. Life span decreases every turn, including current, so after turn 30, it has 5 turns left? Let's clarify life span.\n\nLife span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it's gone at turn t + L. So for food at (3,1), life span 6 at turn 30, so it will be there until turn 35, and disappear at turn 36. Similarly for (2,6), life span 8, so disappears at turn 38.\n\nValue: both are +1, positive food.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. But walls at borders, so playable cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSo obstacles: all border cells (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: let's list them in order:\n\n- Head: (3,5)\n\n- Segment 1: (2,5)\n\n- Segment 2: (2,4)\n\n- Segment 3: (3,4)\n\n- Segment 4: (3,3)\n\n- Segment 5: (3,2)\n\n- Segment 6: (4,2)\n\n- Tail: (4,1)\n\nSo the snake has 8 segments, including head. Length is 8.\n\nHead direction is R, so it moved right to (3,5) from previous position. Since positions are given with head first, and previous head was (2,5) before moving right to (3,5). So current direction is right.\n\nNow food:\n\n- (3,1): value +1, life span 6 (disappears at turn 36)\n\n- (2,6): value +1, life span 8 (disappears at turn 38)\n\nBoth are positive food.\n\nI need to choose actions for multiple turns, starting from turn 30.\n\nFirst, possible moves from current position (3,5) with direction R.\n\nSince head direction is R, I can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse. Reverse of R is L, so I cannot move left immediately.\n\nSo allowed moves: U (up), D (down), R (right). Cannot move L (left) because it's opposite to current direction.\n\nNow, let's see what each move does.\n\nMove options from (3,5):\n\n- U: (3,6)\n\n- D: (3,4)\n\n- R: (4,5)\n\nBut I need to check if these are valid, no collision or wall.\n\nFirst, walls: borders are walls, so y=0 and y=7 are walls. (3,6): y=6 is playable since y=7 is wall, y=6 is not wall. Playable y from 1 to 6, so (3,6) is within bounds.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) is within bounds.\n\n(4,5): x=4, y=5, should be fine.\n\nNow, internal obstacle: (4,6) is obstacle, but (4,5) is not (4,6), so fine.\n\nNow, check if moving to these cells causes collision.\n\nSnake body: current positions are (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1)\n\nIf I move:\n\n- U to (3,6): is (3,6) occupied? Snake positions: (3,5) is head, but when I move, head moves to (3,6), and body follows, so the tail moves away, but for collision, when head moves to a cell, it should not be occupied by any body segment except possibly the tail, but in this case, (3,6) is not in the current body positions. Body: (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1). None at (3,6), so safe.\n\n- D to (3,4): (3,4) is occupied by segment 3. Segment 3 is (3,4), which is body. If head moves to (3,4), it would collide with its own body. Because the body segment is still there when head moves.\n\nIn snake movement, when head moves, the body follows, so the cell that was occupied by the tail is vacated, but other body segments are still occupied until they move.\n\nSpecifically, when head moves to a new cell, if that cell is occupied by any body segment except the tail, it's a collision. Because the tail will move, so if head moves to tail position, it's ok, but only if it's the tail.\n\nIn this case, (3,4) is segment 3, which is not the tail; tail is (4,1). So moving to (3,4) would cause collision with body.\n\nSimilarly, moving R to (4,5): (4,5) is not in current body positions, so should be safe.\n\nBody positions: (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1). (4,5) not there, so ok.\n\nAlso, no wall at (4,5).\n\nNow, food: (3,1) and (2,6) are not at these positions, so no food eaten immediately.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, there is food at (3,1), which is currently occupied by the snake? Snake positions include (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), but (3,1) is not listed. Food at (3,1), but snake has segments at (3,2), (4,2), (4,1), so (3,1) is empty now? Let's list all occupied cells.\n\nSnake: (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1)\n\nSo (3,1) is not occupied; it has food. Similarly, (2,6) has food.\n\nFood can be under the body? In this case, (3,1) is not under body; it's free. Body is at (3,2) and (4,2), (4,1), so (3,1) is adjacent but not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) is free.\n\nNow, about food under body: it says food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves on. Here, no food under body currently.\n\nBack to moves.\n\nFrom (3,5), possible actions: U, D, R (since L not allowed).\n\nBut D to (3,4) is invalid because (3,4) is occupied by body segment 3.\n\nSo only U and R are valid moves? D is not valid because collision.\n\nLet me confirm: if I move down to (3,4), which is currently occupied by the third body segment. When I move, the head would be moving to a cell that is occupied, so it collides. Yes, death.\n\nSo invalid move.\n\nTherefore, only U and R are possible.\n\nNow, U: to (3,6)\n\nR: to (4,5)\n\nNow, after moving, the snake body will shift. The tail will move, etc.\n\nI need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, there is a food at (2,6) and (3,1).\n\n(2,6) is at y=6, which is the top row, since y=7 is wall, so y=6 is playable.\n\n(3,1) is at bottom, y=1.\n\nNow, life span: (3,1) disappears at turn 36, so 6 turns from now (turn 30 to 36 is 6 turns? Turn 30: food has life span 6, meaning after 6 more turns it disappears. At turn 30, it has 6 turns left including current? Life span decreases every turn including current.\n\nDefinition: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo at turn t, with life span L, it will be present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappear at turn t+L.\n\nFor example, at turn t, life span L, after this turn, life span becomes L-1, and so on, until 0, then disappears.\n\nStandard: if life span is N at turn t, it decreases by 1 each turn, so at turn t+1, life span N-1, ..., at turn t+N-1, life span 1, then at turn t+N, it disappears.\n\nSo for (3,1) at turn 30, life span 6: present at turns 30,31,32,33,34,35; gone at 36.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) life span 8: present from turn 30 to 37, gone at 38.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions to eat food safely.\n\nFirst, let's consider the food at (3,1). It's at (3,1), and the snake has tail at (4,1), and segment at (4,2) and (3,2).\n\nCurrent head at (3,5).\n\nTo eat (3,1), I need to get the head to (3,1) when it's not occupied, but currently it's not occupied.\n\nBut the snake body is around it.\n\nSpecifically, (3,2) is a body segment, so if I want to eat (3,1), I need to move such that the body moves away from (3,2) or something.\n\nSince (3,1) is free, I can move head to (3,1) directly if possible, but I need a path.\n\nBut there is a body segment at (3,2), which is above (3,1).\n\nIf I move down to (3,4), but that's invalid now because (3,4) is occupied.\n\nFrom current position, I can only go U or R.\n\nLet me think about the grid.\n\nList all cells:\n\nRow y=6: cells (1,6) to (6,6), but (4,6) is obstacle, so not playable.\n\nSimilarly, borders: x=0,7 and y=0,7 walls.\n\nPlayable: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 except (4,6).\n\nNow snake: head (3,5), body (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1)\n\nSo the snake is mostly on the left and center.\n\nFood: (3,1) and (2,6)\n\n(2,6) is at top-left, (3,1) at bottom-left.\n\nSince head is at (3,5), and I can go up or right.\n\nIf I go up to (3,6), that's y=6, which is adjacent to (2,6) food.\n\n(3,6) is at (3,6), (2,6) is at (2,6), so adjacent horizontally.\n\nIf I go to (3,6), then from there I could go left to (2,6) to eat the food, but need to check.\n\nFirst, let's simulate possible actions.\n\nOption 1: Move Up (U) to (3,6) on turn 30.\n\nThen, new head position (3,6), body shifts: the new body will be (3,6) head, then previous head (3,5) becomes segment 1, then (2,5) segment 2, (2,4) segment 3, (3,4) segment 4, (3,3) segment 5, (3,2) segment 6, (4,2) segment 7, and tail (4,1) is gone, new tail is (4,2)? Let's see.\n\nWhen head moves to new cell, the tail is removed, so the snake moves forward.\n\nSo after move U to (3,6):\n\nNew positions: head at (3,6), then body: (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2)\n\nThe tail (4,1) is left, so snake length still 8, but positions shifted.\n\nPrevious positions: [ (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1) ]\n\nAfter head moves to (3,6): new head (3,6), then the first body segment is the previous head (3,5), then (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2). The last segment (4,1) is removed, so new tail is (4,2).\n\nNow, at (3,6), is there food? Food is at (2,6) and (3,1), not at (3,6), so no food eaten.\n\nNow, head direction is now U, since I moved up.\n\nFrom here, I can go to (2,6) which has food.\n\n(2,6) is left from (3,6), so move L (left).\n\nBut current direction is U, so moving left is not reverse; reverse of U is D. So moving L is allowed.\n\nFrom (3,6), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut U to (3,7): y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n\nD to (3,5): (3,5) is now occupied by the first body segment, so if I move down, head to (3,5), which is body, collision.\n\nL to (2,6): (2,6) is food position, and it's not occupied by body, so should be safe to move and eat.\n\nR to (4,6): but (4,6) is internal obstacle, wall, so invalid.\n\nSo from (3,6), only possible move is L to (2,6), since U, D, R are invalid.\n\nU is wall, D is body collision, R is wall, so only L to (2,6).\n\nIf I move L to (2,6), I eat the food at (2,6), which is +1, so snake grows.\n\nWhen I eat food, the tail doesn't move, so snake length increases.\n\nSo after moving to (2,6) and eating food:\n\nNew head at (2,6), then body: (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2) and since I ate food, I add a new segment, so tail stays, meaning the new tail is the old tail, so positions: head (2,6), then (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2) and the previous tail (4,2) is still there, but since I ate, I don't remove the tail, so the snake has 9 segments now.\n\nPrevious positions before move: head at (3,6), body (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2)\n\nAfter moving head to (2,6) and eating food: new head (2,6), then add the previous head as new segment, so body: (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2) and since I ate, the tail (4,2) is not removed, so positions: (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2) — that's 9 positions.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, head direction is L, since I moved left.\n\nNow, from (2,6), possible moves.\n\nFirst, U: (2,7) y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nD: (2,5) — but (2,5) is occupied by body segment (fourth segment? Positions: head (2,6), then (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), ... so (2,5) is the fourth body segment, not tail. Tail is (4,2). So moving to (2,5) would be collision.\n\nL: (1,6) — x=1, y=6, should be playable? x=1 is not wall, x=0 is wall, so x=1 to 6 ok. (1,6) is free? No body or wall, so possible.\n\nR: (3,6) — but (3,6) is occupied by the first body segment, so collision.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (2,5) is invalid, L to (1,6) or R to (3,6) invalid, U invalid. So only L to (1,6) is possible? L to (1,6).\n\n(1,6) is left, current direction L, so moving L is same, not reverse.\n\nReverse would be R, but R is invalid anyway.\n\nSo only move is L to (1,6).\n\nThen, no food at (1,6), so just move.\n\nNew head (1,6), body: (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2) and tail (4,2) is removed? No, since no food eaten, tail is removed.\n\nAfter moving to (1,6) without eating: head (1,6), then previous head (2,6) becomes segment, and tail (4,2) is removed, so body: (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) — new tail is (3,2).\n\nPositions: head (1,6), then (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) — 9 segments? After eating at (2,6), snake has 9 segments, then moving to (1,6) without eating, so head moves to (1,6), body follows: the segment at (4,2) is removed, so new positions: head (1,6), then (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) — yes, tail at (3,2).\n\nNow head at (1,6), direction L.\n\nFrom here, possible moves: U to (1,7) wall, invalid; D to (1,5) — (1,5) should be free, no body; R to (2,6) but (2,6) is now body segment, collision; L to (0,6) x=0 wall, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is D to (1,5).\n\nAnd so on. But this path might be risky because I'm going to the corner.\n\nBut in this case, if I choose U at turn 30, I end up eating (2,6) on turn 31, and then moving to (1,6) on turn 32, and so on.\n\nBut let's see the other option.\n\nBack to turn 30, I could go R instead of U.\n\nOption 2: Move Right (R) to (4,5) on turn 30.\n\nFrom (3,5) to (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is free, no body, no wall.\n\nAfter move: new head (4,5), body: (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,1) — tail (4,1) removed? No, moved without eating, so tail (4,1) removed, new tail is (4,2)? Positions: head (4,5), then (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2) — and (4,1) gone, so tail at (4,2).\n\nNo food at (4,5), so no growth.\n\nHead direction now R.\n\nFrom (4,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut L is left, which is reverse of current direction R? Reverse of R is L, so cannot move left immediately.\n\nCurrent direction is R, so cannot move L.\n\nAllowed: U, D, R.\n\nU to (4,6): but (4,6) is internal obstacle, wall, invalid.\n\nD to (4,4): (4,4) should be free, no body.\n\nR to (5,5): also free.\n\nNow, (4,4) and (5,5) both seem free.\n\nBut I need to consider the food.\n\nThere is food at (3,1) which is below.\n\nAlso, life span: (3,1) has only 6 turns left, including turn 30, so I need to eat it soon if possible.\n\n(2,6) has more time.\n\nIn option 1, if I go U, I can eat (2,6) quickly on turn 31.\n\nBut then I might be trapped in the top-left corner.\n\nIn option 2, going R to (4,5), I can then go down towards (3,1).\n\nFor example, from (4,5), I can go D to (4,4), then to (4,3), etc., to reach (3,1).\n\nBut let's see the body.\n\nCurrent body has segments at (3,5), (2,5), etc., and (3,2), (4,2), so to reach (3,1), I need to go down.\n\n(3,1) is at (3,1), and there is a body segment at (3,2) above it.\n\nIf I want to eat (3,1), I need to move so that the head can reach (3,1) when (3,2) is not occupied or something.\n\nSpecifically, if I move the head to (3,1), but (3,2) is currently a body segment.\n\nWhen I move, if I can get to a position where (3,2) is the tail or something.\n\nLet's think about the tail reward danger.\n\nFood at (3,1) is positive, and if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills, but here the food is at (3,1), not on tail.\n\nTail is at (4,1) or after moves.\n\nCurrently tail at (4,1).\n\n(4,1) has no food, food is at (3,1), adjacent.\n\nBut tail reward danger only if the food is on the tail cell and head is adjacent.\n\nHere, food is at (3,1), tail at (4,1), so not on tail.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTo eat (3,1), I need to move head to (3,1) when it's free.\n\nCurrently, from (3,5), if I go down, but I can't, as it's invalid.\n\nIf I go right to (4,5), then down to (4,4), then left to (3,4)? But (3,4) is body.\n\nLet's simulate from (4,5).\n\nAfter moving R to (4,5) on turn 30:\n\nPositions: head (4,5), body (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2) — tail at (4,2).\n\nHead direction R.\n\nNow turn 31: from (4,5), I can move U, D, or R (since L not allowed).\n\nU to (4,6) wall, invalid.\n\nD to (4,4): (4,4) free, so move D.\n\nNew head (4,4), body: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2) — tail (4,2) removed? No food, so tail removed, new positions: head (4,4), then (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) — tail at (3,2).\n\nHead direction now D.\n\nFrom (4,4), turn 32: possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nReverse of D is U, so cannot move U? Current direction D, so reverse is U, cannot move up.\n\nAllowed: D, L, R.\n\nD to (4,3): (4,3) free? Let's see, current positions: head (4,4), body (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) — so (4,3) not occupied.\n\nL to (3,4): (3,4) is occupied by body, sixth segment? Positions: after move to (4,4), positions are: (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) — so (3,4) is the sixth position, body segment, so moving to (3,4) would collide.\n\nR to (5,4): should be free.\n\nSo possible: D to (4,3) or R to (5,4).\n\nNow, to reach (3,1), I should go down.\n\nSo move D to (4,3) on turn 32.\n\nNew head (4,3), body: (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) — tail (3,2) removed, new positions: head (4,3), then (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3) — tail at (3,3).\n\nHead direction D.\n\nTurn 33: from (4,3), moves: D, L, R allowed (cannot U).\n\nD to (4,2): but (4,2) is not occupied now? Current body: (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3) — (4,2) free? Previous tail was (3,2), now gone, so (4,2) should be free.\n\nBut there is food at (3,1), not (4,2).\n\n(4,2) might be free, but let's see.\n\nL to (3,3): (3,3) is occupied by tail? Positions: head (4,3), body (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3) — so (3,3) is the tail segment. If I move to (3,3), since it's the tail, it should be ok because the tail moves away.\n\nMoving to tail cell is allowed because tail moves.\n\nR to (5,3): free.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (4,2), L to (3,3), R to (5,3).\n\nNow, I want to get to (3,1), so moving L to (3,3) might be good, but (3,3) is tail.\n\nIf I move L to (3,3), since it's the tail, no collision, and I move to (3,3).\n\nThen new head (3,3), and since I moved to tail, the tail was there, but it moves, so the snake doesn't grow, positions: head (3,3), then previous head (4,3), and body: (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), and the tail (3,3) is gone, but since I moved to it, the new body is (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) — and the segment that was at (3,3) is removed? Standard snake: when head moves to a cell, if not food, tail is removed.\n\nHere, moving to (3,3), which was tail, and no food there, so head to (3,3), then body: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) — and the previous tail (3,3) is vacated, so new tail is (3,4).\n\nPositions: head (3,3), then (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) — tail at (3,4).\n\nNow head at (3,3), direction L.\n\nFrom here, I can go down to (3,2), but (3,2) is not occupied, current body: (4,3), (4,4), etc., (3,2) free.\n\n(3,2) is free, and below is (3,1) with food.\n\nSo from (3,3), I can move D to (3,2) on turn 34? Turn 33 I moved to (3,3), so turn 34.\n\nFirst, turn 33: after moving to (3,3), head at (3,3), direction L.\n\nTurn 34: from (3,3), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nCurrent direction L, so reverse is R, cannot move R.\n\nAllowed: U, D, L.\n\nU to (3,4): (3,4) is tail, so can move, but let's see.\n\nD to (3,2): (3,2) free.\n\nL to (2,3): free? Not occupied.\n\nBut to get to (3,1), go D to (3,2).\n\nMove D to (3,2).\n\nNew head (3,2), body: (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) — tail (3,4) removed? No food at (3,2), so tail removed, new positions: head (3,2), then (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) — tail at (2,4).\n\nHead direction D.\n\nNow, food at (3,1), which is below (3,2).\n\nSo turn 35: from (3,2), move D to (3,1).\n\n(3,1) has food, so eat it.\n\nMove D to (3,1), eat food +1.\n\nNew head (3,1), then body: (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) and since ate, add new segment, so tail stays, positions: head (3,1), then (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) — 9 segments.\n\nAnd food eaten on turn 35, which is before it disappears at turn 36.\n\nLife span: at turn 30, life span 6, so disappears after 6 turns, at turn 36. So on turn 35, it is still there, can be eaten.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in this path, I ate (3,1) on turn 35.\n\nBut I also have (2,6) which I haven't eaten, and it disappears at turn 38.\n\nIn this path, after eating (3,1), I am at (3,1) with head, and body around.\n\nBut I can try to go for (2,6) later, but it's far.\n\nIn the first path, by going U on turn 30, I ate (2,6) on turn 31.\n\nBut then I might be in a tight spot.\n\nLet me compare the two options.\n\nFirst, if I go U on turn 30:\n\n- Turn 30: U to (3,6)\n\n- Turn 31: L to (2,6) eat food, score +1\n\n- Turn 32: L to (1,6) only choice\n\n- Turn 33: D to (1,5) only choice? From (1,6), after turn 32, head at (1,6), direction L.\n\nThen turn 33: from (1,6), moves: U invalid, D to (1,5), R to (2,6) body collision, L invalid, so D to (1,5)\n\nThen head at (1,5), direction D.\n\nThen turn 34: from (1,5), moves: U, D, L, R but reverse of D is U, cannot U? Current direction D, reverse U, cannot move U.\n\nAllowed: D, L, R.\n\nD to (1,4): free\n\nL to (0,5) wall invalid\n\nR to (2,5): may be occupied? Positions after turn 33: head (1,5), body (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3) — let's track positions.\n\nAfter turn 31: ate at (2,6), positions: head (2,6), body (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2) — 9 segments.\n\nTurn 32: move L to (1,6), no food, so head (1,6), body (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) — tail (3,2) removed? No, since no eat, tail removed, so positions: head (1,6), then (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3) — tail at (3,3). 8 segments now? After eating at turn 31, length 9, then turn 32 no eat, so length back to 8? No.\n\nAfter eating at turn 31, snake has 9 segments. When no eat, moving removes tail, so length decreases? No.\n\nSnake length increases only when eating food. When not eating, length stays the same, but tail moves.\n\nStandard: when you eat, length increases by one, tail doesn't move. When not eat, tail moves, length same.\n\nIn turn 31, ate, so after that, length 9.\n\nTurn 32, move to (1,6), no food, so head moves to (1,6), the segment that was tail is removed, so length decreases? No, the number of segments remains, but the tail cell is vacated.\n\nSnake has a fixed length when not eating; when eating, length increases.\n\nSo after eating at turn 31, length 9.\n\nWhen moving to (1,6) on turn 32 without eating, the head moves to new cell, the tail is removed, so the snake has 8 segments now? Let's think.\n\nPositions: before move turn 32, snake at: head (2,6), body (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2) — 9 cells.\n\nAfter move to (1,6): head to (1,6), then the body follows: the first body segment moves to (2,6), but (2,6) was head, now it becomes segment, and so on, up to the tail: the segment at (4,2) was tail, it moves to where? The body shifts: each segment moves to the position of the previous one.\n\nSpecifically: new head (1,6), then new segment 1: previous head (2,6), new segment 2: previous segment 1 (3,6), new segment 3: previous segment 2 (3,5), new segment 4: previous segment 3 (2,5), new segment 5: previous segment 4 (2,4), new segment 6: previous segment 5 (3,4), new segment 7: previous segment 6 (3,3), new segment 8: previous segment 7 (3,2), and the previous segment 8 (tail) at (4,2) is removed, not part of snake.\n\nSo new positions: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3) — and (3,2) is new tail? Positions: head (1,6), then (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3) — that's 8 segments, tail at (3,3).\n\nYes, length 8 now.\n\nSimilarly, turn 33: from (1,6) move D to (1,5), no food.\n\nNew head (1,5), body: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) — tail (3,4) removed, new tail (3,4)? Positions: head (1,5), then (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) — tail at (3,4).\n\nHead direction D.\n\nThen turn 34: from (1,5), moves: D, L, R allowed (cannot U).\n\nD to (1,4): free\n\nL invalid\n\nR to (2,5): (2,5) is occupied by fifth segment? Positions: head (1,5), body (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) — so (2,5) is the sixth position, body, so moving to (2,5) collision.\n\nSo only D to (1,4).\n\nAnd so on, I'm stuck moving down the left wall, and it might be hard to get out or eat other food.\n\nWhereas in the second path, by going right, I can eat (3,1) safely and then have more space.\n\nBut in the second path, I didn't eat (2,6), which has value +1 and disappears at turn 38.\n\nI could potentially eat both.\n\nFor example, after eating (3,1), I am at (3,1) on turn 35, with body, and I can try to go up to eat (2,6).\n\nBut (2,6) is at (2,6), and I am at (3,1), with obstacles and body in between.\n\nFrom (3,1), after eating, positions: head (3,1), body (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) — from earlier simulation.\n\nHead at (3,1), direction D (since moved down to it).\n\nNow, to go to (2,6), I need to move up and left, but there might be issues.\n\nFor instance, from (3,1), turn 36: possible moves U, D, L, R.\n\nCurrent direction D, reverse U, cannot move U? Reverse of D is U, so cannot move up immediately.\n\nAllowed: D, L, R.\n\nD to (3,0) y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nL to (2,1): (2,1) should be free.\n\nR to (4,1): (4,1) free? No body, but is it within bounds? x=4,y=1, playable.\n\nBut if I go L to (2,1), or R to (4,1).\n\nTo reach (2,6), going left might be better.\n\nBut (2,6) is at y=6, I am at y=1.\n\nAnd there is the body and obstacle.\n\nSpecifically, from (2,1), I can go up, but need to avoid body.\n\nBut time is short, (2,6) disappears at turn 38, so I have turns 36,37 to eat it.\n\nTurn 35 I am at (3,1), turn 36 move, turn 37 move, turn 38 it disappears, so I need to eat by turn 37.\n\nAt turn 35, head at (3,1).\n\nTurn 36: from (3,1), cannot move U (reverse), can move D invalid, so L to (2,1) or R to (4,1).\n\nSay move L to (2,1).\n\nNew head (2,1), body: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) — but no eat, so tail removed: previous tail (2,4) removed? Positions before move: head (3,1), body (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) — 9 segments.\n\nAfter move to (2,1) no eat: head (2,1), then (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) — and (2,4) removed, tail at (2,5).\n\nHead direction L.\n\nTurn 37: from (2,1), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nCurrent direction L, reverse R, cannot move R.\n\nAllowed: U, D, L.\n\nU to (2,2): free? Not occupied.\n\nD to (2,0) wall invalid.\n\nL to (1,1): free.\n\nR not allowed.\n\nSo U to (2,2) or L to (1,1).\n\nTo go up, U to (2,2).\n\nThen new head (2,2), etc.\n\nBut (2,6) is at (2,6), which is far; from (2,2) to (2,6) is 4 steps up, but I have only this turn and next? Turn 37: at (2,1), move to (2,2) or (1,1).\n\nIf to (2,2), then turn 38: from (2,2), can move U to (2,3), and so on, not reaching (2,6) in time.\n\nFrom (2,1) turn 37, if I move U to (2,2), turn 38 U to (2,3), etc., not to (2,6).\n\nIf I move to (1,1), similar.\n\nI can't reach (2,6) from here in two moves.\n\nFrom turn 35 at (3,1), I could have moved differently, but I can't move up immediately.\n\nPerhaps I should consider not eating (3,1) first, but going for (2,6) directly from start.\n\nAt turn 30, if I go U, I eat (2,6) on turn 31, as in first option.\n\nThen I have the food at (3,1) which I can try to eat, but it disappears at turn 36, so I need to eat by turn 35.\n\nIn the first path, after eating (2,6) on turn 31, I am at (1,6) on turn 32, then (1,5) on turn 33, etc.\n\nAt turn 33, head at (1,5), as before.\n\nFrom (1,5), turn 34 move D to (1,4), and so on.\n\nTo reach (3,1), it's far, and I have only until turn 35 to eat it.\n\nFrom (1,5) turn 33, to (3,1) in two moves: impossible, since it's at least 4 steps away (right and down).\n\nSo I cannot eat (3,1) if I go for (2,6) first.\n\nSimilarly, if I go for (3,1) first by going right, I can eat it on turn 35, but then (2,6) is hard to reach.\n\nBut (2,6) has more time, disappears at turn 38.\n\nAfter eating (3,1) on turn 35, I have turns 36,37 to reach (2,6).\n\nBut from (3,1) to (2,6) is |dx|=1, |dy|=5, so Manhattan distance 6, but with body and walls, it might take more turns.\n\nFor example, from (3,1) turn 36, I can only move L or R (since cannot U), say to (2,1) or (4,1).\n\nThen turn 37 from (2,1) can move U to (2,2), etc., not close to (2,6).\n\nIf I go to (4,1), then to (4,2), but (4,2) might be occupied or not.\n\nAfter turn 35, positions at (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)\n\nSo (4,2) is free? Not occupied.\n\nFrom (3,1) turn 36, move R to (4,1).\n\nThen head (4,1), body: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) — tail (2,5) removed? No eat, so tail removed, new positions: head (4,1), then (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5) — tail at (3,5).\n\nHead direction R (since moved right).\n\nThen turn 37: from (4,1), moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nCurrent direction R, reverse L, cannot move L.\n\nAllowed: U, D, R.\n\nU to (4,2): (4,2) free, so possible.\n\nD to (4,0) wall invalid.\n\nR to (5,1): free.\n\nSo move U to (4,2), for example.\n\nThen still not close to (2,6).\n\nFrom there, I can go to (4,3), but (4,3) is body, etc.\n\nNo way to reach (2,6) by turn 37 or 38.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to eat both foods given the time constraints and positions.\n\nI need to choose which one to eat.\n\nNow, (3,1) disappears sooner, at turn 36, so it's more urgent.\n\n(2,6) has later deadline.\n\nBut (2,6) is closer to current position.\n\nFrom (3,5) to (2,6) is |dx|=1, |dy|=1, so adjacent, can reach in one move if I go up then left, but from (3,5), I can go U to (3,6), then L to (2,6) on next turn, as in first option.\n\nFor (3,1), from (3,5) to (3,1) is |dy|=4, so at least 4 moves down, but with body in way, it took me 5 moves in the simulation: turn 30 R, 31 D, 32 D, 33 L, 34 D, 35 D to eat.\n\nTurn 30 to 35 is 5 turns to eat.\n\nSince turn 30, eat on turn 35, so 5 turns.\n\nBut (3,1) can be eaten until turn 35 inclusive, so it's possible.\n\nFor (2,6), I can eat on turn 31 if I go U then L.\n\nNow, score-wise, both give +1, so same.\n\nBut I need to consider long-term survival.\n\nIn the first option, after eating (2,6), I am in the corner with limited moves, and might die soon.\n\nFor example, from (1,5), I have to go down to (1,4), then (1,3), etc., and the grid has obstacles, so I might hit a wall or body.\n\nWhereas in the second option, after eating (3,1), I am in the bottom, but have more space to move, like to the right.\n\nFor instance, from (3,1) after eating, I can move right to (4,1), then up to (4,2), etc., and the right side is more open.\n\nAlso, there might be more food later, but no other food mentioned, so only these two.\n\nBut the game continues, so I need to survive to eat possible future food.\n\nIn the corner, it's riskier.\n\nMoreover, there is the internal obstacle at (4,6), which might block paths.\n\nBut in the bottom, I have space.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (2,6) is at y=6, and there is an obstacle at (4,6), so the top row has limited space.\n\nSpecifically, row y=6: cells (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (5,6), (6,6) since (4,6) obstacle.\n\nBut (3,6) and (2,6) are occupied after I go there.\n\nIn the first path, after eating (2,6), I have to go to (1,6), then down, so I'm confined to left column.\n\nWhereas if I don't go there, I can explore other areas.\n\nBut since no other food, I need to survive.\n\nPerhaps for long-term, it's better to eat (3,1) and avoid the corner.\n\nBut I can eat (2,6) quickly and then try to get out, but it's tight.\n\nLet's see if I can escape after eating (2,6).\n\nFor example, after turn 32 at (1,6), I go to (1,5) on turn 33.\n\nThen turn 34: from (1,5) to (1,4)\n\nThen turn 35: from (1,4) to (1,3) or if possible, but only down.\n\nFrom (1,4), direction D, can move D, L, R but L invalid, R to (2,4) may be occupied.\n\nAfter turn 34 at (1,4), positions: let's not track all, but generally, the body might block.\n\nFrom (1,4), I can move R to (2,4) if free.\n\nFor example, at turn 33 head at (1,5), body (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3) — tail at (3,3)? Earlier.\n\nAfter turn 33: moved D to (1,5), no eat, so head (1,5), body (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) — tail at (3,4).\n\nThen turn 34: from (1,5), move D to (1,4) (only choice, since R to (2,5) occupied).\n\nHead to (1,4), body: (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) — tail (2,4) removed? No eat, so tail removed, new positions: head (1,4), then (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5) — tail at (2,5).\n\nHead direction D.\n\nThen turn 35: from (1,4), moves: D, L, R.\n\nD to (1,3): free\n\nL invalid\n\nR to (2,4): (2,4) is not occupied? Current body: (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5) — so (2,4) free? Yes, no body there.\n\nSo I can move R to (2,4).\n\nThen head (2,4), body: (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5), (2,5) — tail (2,5) removed? No eat, so tail removed, new positions: head (2,4), then (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5) — tail at (3,5).\n\nNow head at (2,4), and I can move to other places.\n\nBut at this point, the food at (3,1) is gone at turn 36, and I didn't eat it.\n\nBut I survived.\n\nThen from here, I can move to open areas.\n\nSimilarly, in the other path, after eating (3,1), I am at (3,1) with body, and can move to (4,1) or (2,1), then up or right.\n\nSo both can lead to survival, but in the first case, I ate one food, in the second case, I ate the other.\n\nBut (3,1) is more urgent, and if I don't eat it, I miss the chance, whereas (2,6) I might not eat it later, but I can survive without eating it.\n\nThe goal is to maximize score, so eating any food is good.\n\nBut since I can only eat one in this scenario, both give +1, so same score.\n\nBut long-term, by eating (3,1) and staying central, I might have better chance for future food, but no future food specified.\n\nPerhaps I should prioritize based on risk.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 30, I go U to (3,6), but instead of going L to (2,6) immediately, I could do something else, but from (3,6), only L is possible, as we saw, so I have to go to (2,6) or die.\n\nSo no choice.\n\nIf I go R at turn 30, I can avoid the corner.\n\nMoreover, there is a risk with the tail reward danger, but not applicable here.\n\nI think going for (3,1) is safer and I can eat it.\n\nBut let's confirm the life span.\n\n(3,1) disappears at turn 36, so I must eat it by turn 35.\n\nIn the path where I go R, I eat it on turn 35.\n\nIf I go U, I eat (2,6) on turn 31 but miss (3,1).\n\nSo for score, both give one point, but by going U, I eat earlier, but same point.\n\nBut by going R, I eat later but also one point.\n\nHowever, in going U, I risk being trapped, but I can escape as I showed.\n\nBut to simplify, since the score is the same, I should choose the safer path for long-term survival.\n\nGoing to the corner might have higher risk of collision later.\n\nFor example, in the left column, if I go down, and the body follows, I might have no space.\n\nWhereas in the bottom, I have more room.\n\nThe grid is 6x6 playable, with obstacle.\n\nPlayable cells: 36 cells minus one obstacle, 35 cells.\n\nSnake length 8, after eating one, 9, so plenty of space.\n\nBut in corner, it might be tight.\n\nI think it's better to go for (3,1) by moving right first.\n\nSo at turn 30, move R to (4,5).\n\nThen the actions as simulated.\n\nBut I need to output multiple turns.\n\nThe answer format is to list actions for several turns, starting from t1=30.\n\nI should list at least 5 turns or until I eat the food.\n\nBut to be precise.\n\nSince the instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead, I should plan the sequence.\n\nIn the R path:\n\nTurn 30: R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 31: D to (4,4)  // from (4,5) move D\n\nTurn 32: D to (4,3)  // from (4,4) move D\n\nTurn 33: L to (3,3)  // from (4,3) move L to (3,3), which was tail, safe\n\nTurn 34: D to (3,2)  // from (3,3) move D to (3,2)\n\nTurn 35: D to (3,1) eat food\n\nThen after that, I can continue, but for the answer, I need to list actions.\n\nThe format says: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, etc.\n\nAnd since it's a sequence, I should list for a few turns.\n\nBut I don't know how many to list.\n\nPerhaps list until I eat or for 5 turns.\n\nSince turn 30, list to turn 35 or something.\n\nIn this sequence, I eat on turn 35.\n\nIf I go U, I eat on turn 31.\n\nBut I think R is better.\n\nAnother point: in the R path, when I move L to (3,3) on turn 33, (3,3) is the tail, so it's safe, as the tail moves.\n\nSimilarly, all moves are valid.\n\nIn the U path, I also eat but in corner.\n\nI think I prefer the R path.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 30: R\n\nThen turn 31: from (4,5) move D to (4,4)\n\nTurn 32: from (4,4) move D to (4,3)\n\nTurn 33: from (4,3) move L to (3,3)  // direction was D, move L is allowed since not reverse? Current direction after turn 32 is D, since I moved down.\n\nAfter turn 32: head at (4,3), direction D.\n\nThen move L to (3,3), which is left, not reverse; reverse of D is U, so moving L is ok.\n\nThen turn 34: from (3,3) move D to (3,2)  // direction now L? After moving L to (3,3), direction is L.\n\nThen move D to (3,2), which is down, not reverse.\n\nThen turn 35: D to (3,1)\n\nSo sequence: Turn 30: R, Turn 31: D, Turn 32: D, Turn 33: L, Turn 34: D, Turn 35: D\n\nBut I need to output from turn 30 onwards.\n\nSince the food at (2,6) is not eaten, but I can't eat both, so it's fine.\n\nTo maximize, but I can't, so one point is ok.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (2,6) first and then try to eat (3,1), but as we saw, impossible.\n\nSo I think this is reasonable.\n\nNow for the answer format.\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 30: R Turn 31: D Turn 32: D Turn 33: L Turn 34: D Turn 35: D }\n\nBut I should include more turns? Or just these.\n\nSince I ate on turn 35, and the sequence is planned.\n\nBut after that, I need to survive, but for the response, listing up to turn 35 might be sufficient, as the critical part is done.\n\nThe instruction says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", so from turn 30, 5 turns ahead is to turn 35, which is when I eat.\n\nIn the U path, I eat earlier, but I think this is fine.\n\nI think I'll go with this.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, the AI must prioritize eating the positive food at (3,1) due to its imminent disappearance at turn 36 (life span 6 starting at turn 30). The food at (2,6) has a later deadline (disappears at turn 38) but is riskier to pursue first, as it could trap the snake in the top-left corner with limited escape routes. The chosen path moves right initially to avoid the body collision at (3,4) and then descends safely to eat (3,1) on turn 35. This sequence avoids immediate risks, leverages the snake's position, and maintains flexibility for future moves.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Immediate Move (Turn 30)**: From head position (3,5) with direction R, moving down (D) causes collision with body at (3,4), so only up (U) or right (R) are valid. Moving right (R) to (4,5) is safer, avoiding the corner and aligning with the path to (3,1).\n- **Food at (3,1)**: Must be eaten by turn 35 (life span 6: present turns 30-35, gone at 36). The sequence reaches it on turn 35.\n- **Food at (2,6)**: Not pursued due to distance and time constraints after eating (3,1); it disappears at turn 38, but reaching it from (3,1) by turn 37 is impossible with the Manhattan distance and body obstacles.\n- **Collision Avoidance**: All moves avoid walls, obstacles, and body segments. Specifically:\n  - Turn 33: Moving left to (3,3) is safe as it targets the tail cell, which moves away.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: After eating (3,1), the snake is in a less constrained area (bottom) with room to maneuver, reducing collision risk compared to the top-left corner.\n- **5+ Turns Planning**: The sequence covers 6 turns (turns 30-35), ensuring the urgent food is eaten while maintaining safe positions.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 30 (Current Turn)**: Move right (R) to (4,5). This avoids the invalid down move and starts the descent toward (3,1).\n- **Turn 31**: Move down (D) to (4,4). Continues the descent; (4,4) is free.\n- **Turn 32**: Move down (D) to (4,3). Positions the snake closer to (3,1); (4,3) is free.\n- **Turn 33**: Move left (L) to (3,3). This targets the tail cell (safe as the tail moves); direction changes to L.\n- **Turn 34**: Move down (D) to (3,2). Approaches (3,1); (3,2) is free.\n- **Turn 35**: Move down (D) to (3,1) to eat the food (+1 score, snake length increases to 9). Eaten just before disappearance.\n\nAfter turn 35, the snake can explore open areas (e.g., right or up) for potential future food, with no immediate threats.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 30: R \\\\\nTurn 31: D \\\\\nTurn 32: D \\\\\nTurn 33: L \\\\\nTurn 34: D \\\\\nTurn 35: D\n}",

        "step": 31,
        "score": 7,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 31, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) is a corner wall, etc. Internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: head at (4,5), then body segments: (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2). So the snake is 8 segments long.\n\nHead direction is R, which is right, meaning last move was to the right, so from (3,5) to (4,5). Since head is at (4,5) and direction is R, it moved right to get there.\n\nNow food:\n\n- (3,1) with value 1 and life span 5. So it disappears after 5 turns, including this turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 31, life span is 5, meaning it will disappear after turn 35? Let's see: on turn 31, life span is 5; after turn 31, it decreases to 4; turn 32, to 3; turn 33, to 2; turn 34, to 1; turn 35, to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten until turn 34, and on turn 35 it's gone.\n\nSimilarly, food at (2,6) with value 1 and life span 7. Disappears after turn 37? Turn 31:7, 32:6, ..., 37:1, 38:0 gone? Life span decreases each turn, so at turn t, life span N means it has N turns left including this one. After N turns, it's gone.\n\nStandard: if life span is N at turn t, it will disappear after N-1 more turns? Let's clarify.\n\nThe problem says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn 31, life span 5 means: after this turn, it will be 4; after turn 32, 3, and so on, until it reaches 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns when countdown is 1 or more. When countdown is 0, it's gone.\n\nFor (3,1): life span 5 at turn 31. So:\n\n- Turn 31: countdown=5, present\n\n- Turn 32: countdown=4, present\n\n- Turn 33: countdown=3, present\n\n- Turn 34: countdown=2, present\n\n- Turn 35: countdown=1, present\n\n- Turn 36: countdown=0, gone\n\nSimilarly for (2,6): life span 7 at turn 31.\n\n- Present until turn 37 (countdown=1 on turn 37), gone on turn 38.\n\nAnd (4,1): life span 10, so present until turn 40 (countdown=1 on turn 40), gone turn 41.\n\nAll food have value 1, so all positive food. No negative food here.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nCurrent head position: (4,5)\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R. But head direction is R, so I cannot move left immediately because that would be reverse, opposite to current direction. Current direction is R, so I can move U, D, or R, but not L.\n\nRule: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. So since last move was right, I cannot move left now. So possible actions: U, D, R.\n\nNow, let's see the grid.\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7 and y=0,7, so I can't go to those cells. Internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake body: positions: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2)\n\nSo let's map this out for clarity.\n\nGrid rows y=0 to 7, columns x=0 to 7.\n\ny=7 top? Usually in grids, y increases upwards or downwards? In the snake positions, head is (4,5), and it moved right to there, so probably x horizontal, y vertical, with y increasing up or down?\n\nIn the positions: from head (4,5) to (3,5) to (2,5), that's left, then to (2,4), which is down? (2,5) to (2,4) is down if y decreases down, or up if y increases up.\n\n(2,5) to (2,4): if y=4 is below y=5, then down; if y=4 above, then up. But let's see the next: (2,4) to (3,4), which is right, then (3,4) to (3,3), down if y decreasing, or up? (3,4) to (3,3): if y=3 < y=4, then down, assuming y=0 bottom or top?\n\nTypically in such games, (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? But walls are given: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. Internal obstacle (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: let's list coordinates:\n\n- Head: (4,5)\n\n- Segment 1: (3,5)\n\n- Segment 2: (2,5)\n\n- Segment 3: (2,4)\n\n- Segment 4: (3,4)\n\n- Segment 5: (3,3)\n\n- Segment 6: (3,2)\n\n- Segment 7: (4,2)  // tail\n\nNow, from (4,2) to (3,2) would be left, but the snake is moving, so positions are ordered head to tail.\n\nThe movement: to get to this state, head was at (3,5) and moved right to (4,5), so direction R.\n\nBefore that, it must have been at (2,5) and moved right to (3,5)? Positions: (2,5) to (3,5) is right, then to (4,5) right.\n\nBut before (2,5), it was at (2,4) and moved up to (2,5)? (2,4) to (2,5) is up if y increasing up, or down if y decreasing.\n\nAssume standard: let's say (x,y) with x from left to right, y from bottom to top or top to bottom? In the food, (3,1), (2,6), (4,1), and walls y=0 and y=7.\n\nSince internal obstacle at (4,6), and y=6, which might be high or low.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's think of the grid with (0,0) as bottom-left, so y increases up, x increases right. That's common.\n\nIn that case, (2,5) to (2,4) is down, since y decreases.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) to (3,3) down.\n\n(3,2) to (4,2) right? Tail at (4,2), but it moved from where?\n\nSnake positions: [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2)]\n\nSo the tail is at (4,2), and before that it was at (3,2), I think, but positions are listed head to tail, so the segment before tail is (3,2), so the snake moved from (3,2) to (4,2) at some point? But the head is at (4,5), so the movement sequence isn't directly from the positions; positions are current.\n\nTo find where it came from, with head direction R, it came from (3,5) to (4,5).\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) was from (2,5) or elsewhere? The body segments show the path.\n\nFrom positions, the snake body is at those cells, and when it moves, the head goes to a new position, and tail is removed, unless food eaten.\n\nCurrent length 8.\n\nFood: (3,1), (2,6), (4,1)\n\n(3,1) is at x=3,y=1, which is near bottom if y=0 bottom.\n\n(2,6) at x=2,y=6, near top if y=7 top.\n\n(4,1) at x=4,y=1, bottom.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), which is near top.\n\nNow, head at (4,5), which is above the bottom.\n\nPossible moves from (4,5):\n\n- Up: (4,6) but (4,6) is obstacle, so cannot move there. Wall or obstacle, same thing.\n\n- Down: (4,4) - is this free? Let's see what's at (4,4).\n\nSnake body: positions are (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2). So (4,4) is not in the list, so it should be empty.\n\nAlso, no food at (4,4), food at (3,1), (2,6), (4,1).\n\n(4,4) should be free.\n\n- Left: (3,5) but (3,5) is the first body segment. Can I move there?\n\nRule: body collision. Head touches any body segment except the tail, because tail will move.\n\nSpecifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving to a cell occupied by the tail is ok, as long as after move, the tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (4,2), not (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is the first segment after head, so it's body, not tail. So moving to (3,5) would be collision with body, death.\n\nSimilarly, right: (5,5) - is this within bounds? x=5, y=5, x from 0 to 7, y 0 to 7, so (5,5) should be free, no wall, not in snake body? Body positions: all listed, (5,5) not there, so free.\n\nAlso, no food at (5,5).\n\nSo possible moves from (4,5):\n\n- Up: (4,6) - obstacle, invalid.\n\n- Down: (4,4) - empty, valid.\n\n- Left: (3,5) - occupied by body, invalid, collision.\n\n- Right: (5,5) - empty, valid.\n\nAlso, cannot move left because reverse, but even if not reverse, it's occupied.\n\nSo only possible actions: Down to (4,4) or Right to (5,5).\n\nNow, I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n\nFirst, let's list the food and their life spans.\n\nFood at (3,1): value 1, life span 5, so can be eaten until turn 35 (countdown 1 on turn 35, gone turn 36).\n\nTurn 31: countdown=5\n\nTurn 32:4\n\n33:3\n\n34:2\n\n35:1\n\n36:0 gone\n\nSimilarly, (2,6): life span 7\n\nTurn 31:7\n\n32:6\n\n33:5\n\n34:4\n\n35:3\n\n36:2\n\n37:1\n\n38:0 gone\n\n(4,1): life span 10\n\nTurn 31:10\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 40:1, 41:0 gone.\n\nAll value 1.\n\nNow, I need to plan to eat food while avoiding death.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut currently, tail is at (4,2), and food is at (3,1), (2,6), (4,1), none at tail.\n\n(4,2) has no food, so no issue now.\n\nFirst, at turn 31, I have two choices: down to (4,4) or right to (5,5).\n\nLet me consider the grid state.\n\nList all occupied cells:\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal (4,6).\n\nSo wall cells: for example, x=0: (0,0) to (0,7); x=7: (7,0) to (7,7); y=0: (0,0) to (7,0); y=7: (0,7) to (7,7). But corners shared, so all border cells.\n\nSpecifically: cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.\n\nPlus internal (4,6).\n\nSnake: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2)\n\nFood: (3,1), (2,6), (4,1)\n\nNow, from (4,5), moving down to (4,4) or right to (5,5).\n\nI need to think about getting to the food.\n\nFood at (3,1) is near bottom left, (4,1) bottom center, (2,6) top left.\n\nHead at (4,5), so (3,1) is 4 steps down and 1 left, but with body in way.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) is 4 steps down, (2,6) is 1 up and 2 left, but (4,6) is obstacle, so cannot go directly up.\n\nFirst, let's simulate both moves.\n\nOption 1: Move down to (4,4) at turn 31.\n\nThen snake head moves to (4,4), so new positions: head (4,4), then the previous head (4,5) becomes body, so body now: (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) and tail was (4,2), but since no food eaten, tail moves away, so the segment at (3,2) is now the tail? Let's see.\n\nWhen snake moves without eating, head to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, tail is removed.\n\nSo after move down to (4,4):\n\n- New head: (4,4)\n\n- Then the body segments: first segment (which was head) at (4,5) now becomes body segment 1\n\n- Then (3,5) becomes segment 2\n\n- (2,5) segment 3\n\n- (2,4) segment 4\n\n- (3,4) segment 5\n\n- (3,3) segment 6\n\n- (3,2) segment 7\n\n- And tail (4,2) is removed, so the new tail is where? The last body segment is (3,2), but since tail was removed, the new positions are from head to the seventh segment.\n\nOriginal positions: indices 0: (4,5) head, 1: (3,5), 2: (2,5), 3: (2,4), 4: (3,4), 5: (3,3), 6: (3,2), 7: (4,2) tail.\n\nAfter moving head to (4,4) without eating:\n\n- New head: (4,4)\n\n- Body: position 0 moves to (4,4), so segment 0 new position (4,4)\n\n- Then segment 1 moves to previous position of segment 0, which was (4,5)\n\n- Segment 2 moves to previous position of segment 1, which was (3,5)\n\n- Segment 3 moves to previous position of segment 2, which was (2,5)\n\n- Segment 4 moves to previous position of segment 3, which was (2,4)\n\n- Segment 5 moves to previous position of segment 4, which was (3,4)\n\n- Segment 6 moves to previous position of segment 5, which was (3,3)\n\n- Segment 7 (tail) moves to previous position of segment 6, which was (3,2)\n\nBut since no food, the tail is removed, so the snake has one less segment? No, when no food, tail is removed, so the new snake has the same length, but positions shift.\n\nAfter move, the new positions are:\n\n- Head: new position (4,4)\n\n- Then the previous head position (4,5) is now occupied by the first body segment\n\n- Then the previous segment 1 position (3,5) is now occupied by segment 2, but let's list the new list.\n\nThe new body segments are: the new head at (4,4), followed by the previous head position (4,5), then the previous segment 1 position (3,5), then previous segment 2 position (2,5), then previous segment 3 position (2,4), then previous segment 4 position (3,4), then previous segment 5 position (3,3), and the tail is at previous segment 6 position (3,2).\n\nPrevious segment 6 was at (3,2), and it moves to where segment 5 was? Standard snake movement:\n\nWhen moving, the head moves to a new cell. Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in front of it. So:\n\n- Segment 0 (head) moves to new cell\n\n- Segment 1 moves to where segment 0 was\n\n- Segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was\n\n- ...\n\n- Segment k moves to where segment k-1 was\n\n- The last segment (tail) is left, since it moves away.\n\nFor a snake of length L, after a move without eating, the new snake has head at new position, and the body from 1 to L-1 are at the previous positions of segments 0 to L-2, and the tail segment L-1 is removed.\n\nPositions: let S be the list of positions before move, with S[0] head, S[1] to S[L-1] body, S[L-1] tail.\n\nAfter moving head to new cell P:\n\n- New head: P\n\n- New body segments: S[0] (old head position) for segment 1, S[1] for segment 2, ..., S[L-2] for segment L-1 (new tail)\n\nSince no food, length same, tail removed, so new positions: [P, S[0], S[1], ..., S[L-2]]\n\nIn this case, L=8, S = [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2)]\n\nAfter move down to (4,4):\n\nNew head: (4,4)\n\nNew segment 1: S[0] = (4,5)\n\nNew segment 2: S[1] = (3,5)\n\nNew segment 3: S[2] = (2,5)\n\nNew segment 4: S[3] = (2,4)\n\nNew segment 5: S[4] = (3,4)\n\nNew segment 6: S[5] = (3,3)\n\nNew segment 7 (tail): S[6] = (3,2)\n\nS[6] was (3,2), which is now the new tail.\n\nS[7] = (4,2) is removed, no longer part of snake.\n\nSo new snake positions: [(4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)]\n\nTail at (3,2)\n\nDirection: since moved down, new head direction D.\n\nNow, if I move right to (5,5) at turn 31.\n\nNew head: (5,5)\n\nNew positions: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)]  // S[0] to S[6], S[7] removed\n\nTail at (3,2)\n\nDirection R.\n\nNow, back to turn 31 choice.\n\nI need to think about accessing the food.\n\nFood at (3,1): to eat it, I need to have head at (3,1) when it's available.\n\nBut (3,1) is at y=1, x=3.\n\nCurrently, the body is at (3,3), (3,2), etc.\n\nFrom current position (4,5), moving down to (4,4) gets me closer to bottom food.\n\nMoving right to (5,5) might lead to less direct path.\n\nAlso, food at (2,6) is at y=6, but (4,6) is obstacle, so I need to go around.\n\n(2,6) is at (2,6), which is above (2,5), but (2,5) is body, so I can go to (2,6) if I move up from (2,5), but (2,5) is not head.\n\nHead is at (4,5), so I need to move to (3,5) or something, but (3,5) is body, occupied.\n\nLet's see possible paths.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving down to (4,4) at turn 31.\n\nThen at turn 32, from (4,4), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut head direction D (down), so cannot move up (reverse).\n\nPossible: down to (4,3), left to (3,4), right to (5,4).\n\nNow, (4,3): is it free? Current snake positions after move: head (4,4), body (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)\n\nSo (4,3) not occupied, not wall, so free.\n\n(3,4): is occupied? In positions, (3,4) is segment 5? New positions: [ (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2) ] so (3,4) is occupied by segment 6? Indices: 0: (4,4), 1: (4,5), 2: (3,5), 3: (2,5), 4: (2,4), 5: (3,4), 6: (3,3), 7: (3,2) tail.\n\nSo (3,4) is occupied by segment 5, so moving left to (3,4) would be collision with body.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) should be free.\n\nSo from (4,4), direction D, possible moves: down to (4,3), or right to (5,4), not left or up.\n\nIf I go down to (4,3), then I can continue down towards (4,1) or (3,1).\n\nSimilarly, if I go right to (5,4), I might go to other areas.\n\nBut let's think about the food life spans.\n\nFood at (3,1) has only until turn 35 to be eaten, 5 turns from now, including turn 31? Turn 31 to 35 is 5 turns, but on turn 35 it can still be eaten.\n\nFrom turn 31 to turn 35, there are 4 moves to reach it? Let's see the Manhattan distance.\n\nFrom (4,5) to (3,1): Δx=1 left, Δy=4 down, so distance 5 cells. But I can't go directly, need to path around body.\n\nFor example, from (4,5) down to (4,4), then to (4,3), then to (4,2), but (4,2) is currently tail at turn 31, but after moves, it changes.\n\nAt turn 31, if I move down to (4,4), positions as above.\n\nAt turn 32, I can move down to (4,3).\n\nNew head (4,3), new positions: [ (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3) ] tail at (3,3) now? S[6] was (3,3), now tail.\n\nS[7] removed.\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen turn 33, from (4,3), move down to (4,2).\n\nBut (4,2) is not occupied now? Current positions: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)\n\n(4,2) is free, not wall.\n\nMove down to (4,2).\n\nNew head (4,2), new positions: [ (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) ] tail at (3,4)\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen turn 34, from (4,2), move down to (4,1). (4,1) has food with value 1.\n\nEat it? Head moves to (4,1), which has food, so eat it, length increases.\n\nNew head (4,1), and since food eaten, tail not removed, so new positions: [ (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) ]  // the previous tail (3,4) stays, and a new segment is added at head? No.\n\nWhen food eaten, head moves to food cell, and the tail does not move, so snake grows by one segment.\n\nSo new positions: the new head at (4,1), followed by the previous positions from head to tail, without removing tail.\n\nPrevious positions before move: head (4,2), body (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), tail (3,4)\n\nAfter moving to (4,1) and eating food:\n\nNew head: (4,1)\n\nThen the entire previous snake: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)\n\nSo new positions: [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)] length 9.\n\nTail at (3,4)\n\nDirection D.\n\nThis is on turn 34, and food at (4,1) is eaten, which had life span 10, so still available.\n\nBut we ate it on turn 34.\n\nNow, food at (3,1) is still there, life span 5 at turn 31, so on turn 34, countdown=2, still present.\n\nAfter eating (4,1), head at (4,1), I can move to (3,1) to eat that food as well.\n\nTurn 34, after eating, head at (4,1), direction down.\n\nPossible moves: since direction down, cannot move up (reverse).\n\nLeft to (3,1), right to (5,1), down to (4,0) but y=0 is wall, invalid.\n\n(5,1) may be free.\n\n(3,1) has food.\n\nSo move left to (3,1).\n\n(3,1) is free? Current positions: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)\n\n(3,1) not occupied, not wall, so free.\n\nMove left to (3,1), eat food there.\n\nNew head (3,1), new positions: [(3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)] length 10.\n\nTail at (3,4)\n\nDirection L (left).\n\nThis is turn 34, and (3,1) had countdown 2 on turn 34, eaten, good.\n\nThen I have eaten two foods by turn 34.\n\nBut this is if I go directly down from turn 31.\n\nAt turn 31, if I move down to (4,4), then turn 32 down to (4,3), turn 33 down to (4,2), turn 34 down to (4,1) eat, then turn 34 move to (3,1)? Turn 34 is the move to (4,1), so after that, on turn 35, I can move to (3,1).\n\nLet's clarify the turns.\n\nTurn 31: move from (4,5) to (4,4)\n\nTurn 32: move from (4,4) to (4,3)\n\nTurn 33: move from (4,3) to (4,2)\n\nTurn 34: move from (4,2) to (4,1) and eat food at (4,1)\n\nNow, after this move, it's still turn 34? The move is on the turn.\n\nThe state after turn 34 move.\n\nThen for turn 35, head at (4,1), direction down (since last move down).\n\nPossible moves: left to (3,1), right to (5,1), or up to (4,2) but (4,2) is occupied by body? Current positions after turn 34: head (4,1), body (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) tail.\n\n(4,2) is segment 1, so moving up to (4,2) would be collision.\n\nDown to (4,0) invalid wall.\n\nSo only left to (3,1) or right to (5,1).\n\n(3,1) has food, so move left to (3,1) on turn 35.\n\nEat food at (3,1), which has countdown=1 on turn 35, so can be eaten.\n\nNew head (3,1), new positions: [(3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)] length 11.\n\nTail at (3,4)\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut what about food at (2,6)? It has life span 7, so until turn 37, I can try to eat it later.\n\nNow, back to turn 31 choice.\n\nIf I move right to (5,5) at turn 31.\n\nThen new head (5,5), positions: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)] tail at (3,2)\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen from (5,5), possible moves: since direction R, cannot move left (reverse).\n\nUp to (5,6): y=6, is it wall? y=7 is wall, y=6 not border, but internal obstacle at (4,6), not (5,6), so (5,6) should be free.\n\nDown to (5,4), free.\n\nRight to (6,5), free.\n\nNow, to get to bottom food, I need to go down and left.\n\nFor example, move down to (5,4) on turn 32.\n\nThen to (5,3), etc., but it might take more turns to reach (3,1) or (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is at (4,1), from (5,5), distance Δx=1 left, Δy=4 down, but with body, need to path.\n\nFor instance, down to (5,4), then down to (5,3), then left to (4,3)? But (4,3) may be occupied.\n\nAt turn 31 after move right, positions: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)]\n\nSo (4,3) not occupied.\n\nBut if I go to (5,4) on turn 32, then (5,3) on turn 33, then to (4,3) or (5,2), etc.\n\nTo reach (4,1), from (5,5) to (5,4) to (5,3) to (5,2) to (5,1) then to (4,1), but (5,1) to (4,1) is left.\n\nBut (4,1) has food, but I need to be at (4,1) when food is there.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) is to the left.\n\nBut with this path, on turn 31: to (5,5)\n\nTurn 32: to (5,4)\n\nTurn 33: to (5,3)\n\nTurn 34: to (5,2)\n\nTurn 35: to (5,1)\n\nThen turn 36: to (4,1) eat, but on turn 36, (4,1) countdown: at turn 31:10, turn 32:9, ..., turn 35:6, turn 36:5, still present, life span 10, gone at turn 41.\n\nBut (3,1) has shorter life: turn 35 countdown=1, can be eaten turn 35, gone turn 36.\n\nIf I go to (5,1) on turn 35, I can move to (4,1) on turn 36, but (3,1) might be gone or not reachable.\n\nFrom (5,1) on turn 35, I could move left to (4,1) on turn 36, but (3,1) is at (3,1), which requires another move left from (4,1) on turn 37, but on turn 36, (3,1) countdown=0? Turn 31:5, 32:4, 33:3, 34:2, 35:1, 36:0 gone. So on turn 36, (3,1) is gone, cannot eat.\n\nSo if I go right at turn 31, I miss (3,1) food, since I can't reach it by turn 35.\n\nWhereas if I go down at turn 31, I can eat both (4,1) and (3,1) by turn 35.\n\nAlso, food at (2,6) is available longer, until turn 37.\n\nSo going down seems better for immediate food.\n\nBut I need to avoid risks.\n\nIn the down path, when I move to (4,1) on turn 34, and then to (3,1) on turn 35, it seems safe.\n\nBut what about the tail? When I eat (4,1), tail is at (3,4), not adjacent to head.\n\nHead at (4,1), tail at (3,4), not adjacent.\n\nThen after moving to (3,1), head at (3,1), tail at (3,4), still not adjacent.\n\nNow, food at (2,6) can be eaten later.\n\nBut there is also the internal obstacle at (4,6), and I need to think about long-term survival.\n\nAfter eating (3,1), head at (3,1), I can move to other places.\n\nFor example, up or right, since direction left.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nAlso, I should consider the other food (2,6).\n\n(2,6) is at (2,6), which is above (2,5).\n\nCurrently, in the snake body, (2,5) and (2,4) are occupied.\n\nTo reach (2,6), I need to be at (2,5) or (1,6) or (3,6) or (2,7), but (2,7) y=7 wall, invalid.\n\n(1,6) x=1,y=6, not wall, but may be free.\n\n(3,6) but (4,6) is obstacle, (3,6) should be free.\n\nBut from (3,1), it's far.\n\nAfter eating (3,1) on turn 35, head at (3,1), I can move up.\n\nFor example, turn 36: from (3,1), direction L, so can move U, D, L, R except reverse? Last move was left to (3,1), so direction L, cannot move right (opposite).\n\nPossible moves: up to (3,2), down to (3,0) invalid wall, left to (2,1), right to (4,1) but direction L, so reverse is right? Current direction left, so opposite is right, cannot move right.\n\nSo can move up, down, or left.\n\nDown to (3,0) invalid, so only up to (3,2) or left to (2,1).\n\n(3,2) is occupied? Current positions after turn 35: head (3,1), body (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) tail.\n\n(3,2) is not in positions? Positions: (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) — (3,2) not there, so free? (3,2) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) should be free.\n\nNow, (3,2) is free, so I can move up to (3,2).\n\nThen to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut to reach (2,6), I need to go up and left.\n\nFor example, from (3,1) move left to (2,1) on turn 36.\n\nThen up to (2,2), and so on, but it might take time.\n\n(2,6) life span until turn 37, so on turn 37, countdown=1, can be eaten.\n\nTurn 37 is 6 turns from now (turn 32 to 37? From turn 31 to 37 is 6 turns).\n\nTurn 31: now\n\nTurn 32: +1\n\n...\n\nTurn 37: +6\n\nAfter eating (3,1) on turn 35, I have turn 36 and 37 to reach (2,6).\n\nFrom (3,1) to (2,6): Δx=1 left, Δy=5 up, distance 6, but with turns, possible if I go directly.\n\nFor example, from (3,1) turn 36 move left to (2,1)\n\nThen turn 37 move up to (2,2)\n\nBut (2,2) to (2,3), etc., to (2,6) would take more moves: from (2,1) to (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6) — that's 5 moves up, but from (2,1) to (2,6) is 5 moves up, but I need to be at (2,6) by turn 37.\n\nAfter turn 35 head at (3,1)\n\nTurn 36: move to (2,1) — one move left\n\nThen (2,1) to (2,2) up, turn 37\n\n(2,2) to (2,3) up, turn 38 — but turn 38, (2,6) is gone, since turn 38 countdown=0.\n\n(2,6) life span 7 at turn 31:\n\nTurn 31:7\n\n32:6\n\n33:5\n\n34:4\n\n35:3\n\n36:2\n\n37:1\n\n38:0 gone\n\nSo on turn 37, countdown=1, can be eaten.\n\nBut to eat on turn 37, I need head at (2,6) on turn 37.\n\nFrom turn 36 position: after turn 36 move.\n\nIf on turn 36 I am at (2,1), I can move up to (2,2) on turn 37, not to (2,6).\n\nI need to be closer.\n\nFrom (3,1), I can move up to (3,2) on turn 36.\n\nThen to (3,3) on turn 37, but (3,3) is not (2,6).\n\nTo reach (2,6), I need to go left and up earlier.\n\nIn the initial choice, if I go down at turn 31, I eat the bottom food but may not reach (2,6) in time.\n\n(2,6) is at (2,6), and at turn 31, snake has body at (2,5), which is below it.\n\nIf I could move up from (2,5) to (2,6), but (2,5) is not head.\n\nAt turn 31, if I move down to (4,4), positions: [(4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)]\n\nThen on turn 32, if I move left to (3,4)? But from (4,4), direction D, cannot move left? Left is (3,4), but (3,4) is occupied, as it is segment 5 in positions? Positions: index 0: (4,4), 1: (4,5), 2: (3,5), 3: (2,5), 4: (2,4), 5: (3,4), 6: (3,3), 7: (3,2) so (3,4) is segment 5, occupied, so cannot move left.\n\nOnly down or right, as before.\n\nIf I go down, I go to bottom.\n\nBut I could, at turn 32, move right to (5,4) instead of down.\n\nFrom (4,4), move right to (5,4).\n\nThen new head (5,4), positions: [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)] tail at (3,3)\n\nDirection R (since moved right).\n\nThen I can go down to (5,3), etc., but this might not help for (2,6).\n\nTo reach (2,6), I need to be near (2,5) or above.\n\nAt turn 31, after moving down to (4,4), the body includes (2,5) at (2,5).\n\nIf I move in a way to free (2,5) or go there.\n\nBut head is at (4,4), I can go left and up, but (3,4) is occupied.\n\nFor example, at turn 32, from (4,4), if I could move up, but direction D, cannot move up.\n\nOnly down or right.\n\nIf I move down to (4,3), then at turn 33 from (4,3), direction D, can move down, left, right.\n\n(4,3), down to (4,2), left to (3,3), right to (5,3).\n\n(3,3) is occupied? After turn 32 move to (4,3), positions: [(4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)] tail at (3,3)\n\n(3,3) is tail, so moving to (3,3) is ok, since tail will move.\n\nRule: can move to tail cell because tail moves away.\n\nSo from (4,3), move left to (3,3) on turn 33.\n\nSince (3,3) is tail, it is safe, no collision.\n\nMove to (3,3), and since no food there, tail moves away.\n\nNew head (3,3), new positions: [(3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)]  // S[0] to S[6], S[7] removed, but S[7] was (3,3), now head is at (3,3), so the new segment 1 is (4,3), etc.\n\nPrevious positions: S = [(4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)]\n\nAfter moving head to (3,3): (3,3) was tail, but now head moves there, so it is eaten? No, only if food, but (3,3) has no food, so just move.\n\nNew head: (3,3)\n\nThen new segment 1: S[0] = (4,3)\n\nSegment 2: S[1] = (4,4)\n\nSegment 3: S[2] = (4,5)\n\nSegment 4: S[3] = (3,5)\n\nSegment 5: S[4] = (2,5)\n\nSegment 6: S[5] = (2,4)\n\nSegment 7: S[6] = (3,4)  // new tail\n\nS[7] = (3,3) is removed, but since head moved to it, it's not occupied twice.\n\nPositions: [(3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)]\n\nTail at (3,4)\n\nDirection L (left).\n\nNow, from (3,3), I can move up to (3,4)? (3,4) is tail, so can move there.\n\n(3,4) has no food, so move to (3,4), tail moves away.\n\nNew head (3,4), new positions: [(3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)] tail at (2,4)\n\nDirection U? Moved up? From (3,3) to (3,4) is up, so direction U.\n\nThen from (3,4), move up to (3,5)? (3,5) is occupied by segment 5? Positions: head (3,4), body (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) tail.\n\n(3,5) is segment 5, body, so moving to (3,5) collision.\n\nMove left to (2,4), but (2,4) is tail, so can move.\n\n(2,4) is tail, move to (2,4), safe.\n\nNew head (2,4), new positions: [(2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)] tail at (2,5)\n\nDirection L (left).\n\nThen from (2,4), move up to (2,5)? (2,5) is tail, can move.\n\nMove to (2,5), new head (2,5), positions: [(2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)] tail at (3,5)\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen from (2,5), move up to (2,6), which has food, if available.\n\n(2,6) has food with value 1.\n\nOn what turn is this?\n\nLet's count turns.\n\nTurn 31: move down to (4,4)\n\nTurn 32: move down to (4,3) or other, but in this path, I moved to (4,3) on turn 32? Earlier I had two options.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nTurn 31: to (4,4)\n\nTurn 32: to (4,3)  // I assumed move down, but in the (2,6) path, I need to go left.\n\nFrom turn 32: at (4,4), I moved down to (4,3) only if I want to go down, but for (2,6), I should not go down.\n\nAt turn 32, from (4,4), I can move right to (5,4), but that might not help.\n\nOr, from (4,4), only down or right, as left is occupied.\n\nSo I have to go down or right at turn 32.\n\nIf I go down to (4,3), then at turn 33 from (4,3), I can move left to (3,3) as I described.\n\nTurn 33: move to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 34: move to (3,4)\n\nThen turn 35: move to (2,4)  // as above\n\nTurn 36: move to (2,5)\n\nThen turn 37: move to (2,6) and eat.\n\nOn turn 37, (2,6) has countdown=1, can be eaten.\n\nBut in this path, I didn't eat the bottom food, so I missed (3,1) and (4,1), which expire sooner.\n\n(3,1) gone on turn 36, (4,1) available longer.\n\nIn this path, I ate (2,6) on turn 37, but missed the other two? (4,1) is still available.\n\nBut (3,1) is gone.\n\nNow, comparing the two options:\n\nIf I go down directly at turn 31, I can eat (4,1) and (3,1) by turn 35, scoring 2.\n\nIf I go this way to (2,6), I eat (2,6) on turn 37, scoring 1, and (4,1) is still there, I can eat it later.\n\nBut (4,1) is easy to eat, but I have to go down.\n\nAlso, in the first path, after eating bottom food, I can still try for (2,6), but as before, it might be tight or not possible.\n\nIn first path, after turn 35 head at (3,1), on turn 36 I can move up to (3,2), then turn 37 to (3,3), but (3,3) to (2,6) not direct.\n\nFrom (3,1) turn 36 move left to (2,1), turn 37 move up to (2,2), not to (2,6).\n\nTo reach (2,6) by turn 37, I need to be at (2,5) or adjacent on turn 36 or 37.\n\nBut on turn 36, if I am at (3,1), not close.\n\nSo if I want to eat (2,6), I need to prioritize it early.\n\nBut (3,1) has short life, so I might lose it.\n\nNow, the values are all +1, so eating two is better than one.\n\nMoreover, (4,1) can be eaten later if needed.\n\nBut in the direct down path, I eat two soon.\n\nAlso, for long-term survival, after eating bottom food, the snake is longer, but I have more space.\n\nNow, back to the right move at turn 31.\n\nIf I move right to (5,5), I might not eat any food soon, and miss (3,1).\n\nFor example, from (5,5), to reach (3,1) takes at least 5 moves: e.g., down to (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), then left to (4,1) or (3,1), but (3,1) gone by turn 36.\n\nSo I can eat (4,1) on turn 36, but miss (3,1).\n\nSo only one food.\n\nWhereas down path, I get two.\n\nMoreover, with down path, I can then go for (2,6) if possible, but as above, it might not be, but since (2,6) gives only one, and I already have two, it might be acceptable to miss it if necessary.\n\nBut let's see if I can get (2,6) after eating bottom.\n\nAfter turn 35 head at (3,1), on turn 36 I move up to (3,2).\n\n(3,2) is free, as positions: head (3,1), body (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) tail.\n\n(3,2) free.\n\nMove up to (3,2), new positions: head (3,2), then (3,1), (4,1), etc., tail moves away.\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen turn 37, from (3,2), move up to (3,3)? (3,3) may be occupied? Current positions: after move to (3,2), new tail, etc.\n\nBut (3,3) not in positions, so free? Previous tail was (3,4), removed or moved.\n\nAfter turn 36 move to (3,2): previous positions S: [(3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)]\n\nNew head (3,2), new positions: [(3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)] tail at (2,4)\n\n(3,3) free.\n\nMove up to (3,3) on turn 37.\n\nThen to (3,4) on turn 38, but (2,6) gone.\n\nNot reaching (2,6).\n\nSo I cannot eat (2,6) if I go for bottom food first.\n\nBut since (2,6) has the same value, and I eat two by going down, it's better to secure those.\n\nMoreover, after eating, I have a longer snake, but the grid has space.\n\nNow, about the internal obstacle at (4,6), which might block some paths, but not immediately.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nFor example, after eating bottom food, head at (3,1), I can move around the left side.\n\nBut let's not overcomplicate.\n\nAnother thing: in the down path, when I move to (4,2) on turn 33, that was the tail at some point, but I moved there, and it was ok.\n\nThen to (4,1) with food.\n\nNo tail reward danger because no food at tail.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTherefore, at turn 31, moving down to (4,4) seems best to get the food with short life.\n\nThen for the subsequent moves, as planned: turn 32 down to (4,3), turn 33 down to (4,2), turn 34 down to (4,1) eat, then turn 35 left to (3,1) eat.\n\nBut on turn 34, after moving to (4,1), head direction down, then on turn 35, I move left to (3,1), which is not reverse, since reverse would be up, but moving left is fine.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output the actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nCurrent turn t1=31.\n\nSo I should plan turns 31 to 36 or so.\n\nBut after turn 35, I need to continue, but I can plan the moves to eat the food.\n\nSince the food at (2,6) might not be reachable, I can ignore it for now.\n\nSo let's outline the moves:\n\nTurn 31: move down to (4,4)\n\nTurn 32: move down to (4,3)\n\nTurn 33: move down to (4,2)\n\nTurn 34: move down to (4,1) and eat\n\nThen turn 35: move left to (3,1) and eat\n\nNow, for turn 36, I need to decide.\n\nAfter turn 35, head at (3,1), direction left.\n\nPossible moves: up to (3,2), left to (2,1), or down invalid, right invalid (reverse).\n\n(2,1) might be free, or I can go up.\n\nSince I need to output 5+ turns, I can include up to turn 36.\n\nBut the immediate priority is to eat the food, which I do by turn 35.\n\nFor long-term, after that, I can move to open space.\n\nFor example, from (3,1) turn 36 move up to (3,2)\n\nThen to (3,3), etc., but I should avoid walls.\n\nSince the grid is 8x8, and snake long, but not full.\n\nAnother food (4,1) is eaten, (3,1) eaten, (2,6) might be missed.\n\nBut I can try to go to (2,6) if possible, but as before, not by turn 37.\n\nTurn 36: move from (3,1) to (3,2)\n\nTurn 37: to (3,3)\n\nBut (2,6) gone.\n\nSo I'll not plan for it.\n\nAfter turn 35, head at (3,1), I can move left to (2,1) on turn 36, then to (2,2) on turn 37, etc., but no food there.\n\nNow, to be safe, I should not go into dead ends.\n\nFor example, bottom left might be tight.\n\nAfter eating (3,1), positions: head (3,1), body to (2,4), so (2,1) is free, (1,1), etc.\n\nI can go left or up.\n\nSince direction left, moving up to (3,2) is fine.\n\nThen from (3,2), I can move left to (2,2) or up to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to specify actions for several turns.\n\nSince the question is to think ahead and output actions, I can output turns 31 to 35 or 36.\n\nBut let's see the format: \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and output actions starting from turn t1.\n\nIn the answer format, it says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nSo I should output for t1=31, then 32, 33, etc.\n\nAt least 5 turns? \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output may be multiple.\n\nI think I should output the sequence for the immediate plan.\n\nSince after turn 35, it's open, I can stop after eating both foods.\n\nSo turns 31 to 35: 5 turns.\n\nTurn 31: D\n\nTurn 32: D\n\nTurn 33: D\n\nTurn 34: D\n\nTurn 35: L\n\nBut on turn 34, I move to (4,1), which is down, and on turn 35, I move left to (3,1).\n\nIn terms of action, yes.\n\nIs there any risk in this path?\n\nWhen I move to (4,2) on turn 33, what is the state?\n\nAt turn 33, after moving to (4,2): positions [(4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)] tail at (3,4)\n\nThen move down to (4,1), which is free.\n\n(4,1) has food, eat.\n\nThen to (3,1).\n\nAll seems safe.\n\nIf I move right at turn 31, I might get to (2,6) but miss (3,1), so worse.\n\nTherefore, I think down is better.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 31: D\n\nTurn 32: D\n\nTurn 33: D\n\nTurn 34: D\n\nTurn 35: L\n\nFor turn 36, I can add if needed, but not necessary.\n\nSince it says \"5+ turns ahead\", perhaps output 5 turns.\n\nBut turn 35 is t1+4, since t1=31, t1+4=35.\n\nt1=31, turn 31: t1, turn 32: t1+1, turn 33: t1+2, turn 34: t1+3, turn 35: t1+4.\n\nSo 5 actions: turns 31 to 35.\n\nTurn 31,32,33,34,35: that's 5 turns.\n\nYes.\n\nTo be precise, let's confirm the moves.\n\nAlso, on turn 35, moving to (3,1), it has food, eat.\n\nNow, about the tail reward danger: when I eat (4,1), the tail is at (3,4), not adjacent to (4,1).\n\nSimilarly for (3,1), tail at (3,4), not adjacent.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSo I think this is good.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I will plan at least 5 turns ahead (turns 31 to 35) based on the current state. The key priorities are:\n- Eat the positive food at (3,1) and (4,1) before they expire (since (3,1) has a short life span of 5 turns, expiring after turn 35, and (4,1) has a longer life span but can be eaten efficiently along the way).\n- Avoid the food at (2,6) for now, as it has a longer life span (until turn 37) and is less accessible without missing the time-sensitive food at (3,1).\n- Minimize risk by moving away from the body and walls, and ensuring no collisions.\n- The immediate move from (4,5) must be Down or Right (since Up is blocked by an obstacle at (4,6), and Left is invalid due to reverse movement restriction and body collision at (3,5)). Down is chosen to directly access the bottom food.\n\n### Plan Details (Turns 31-35):\n- **Turn 31 (current)**: Move Down (D) to (4,4).  \n  - Rationale: Moves closer to (4,1) and (3,1). Avoids Right to (5,5), which would delay reaching the time-sensitive food.\n- **Turn 32**: Move Down (D) to (4,3).  \n  - Rationale: Continues descent toward (4,1). From (4,4), Down is safe (no body or wall; (4,3) is empty).\n- **Turn 33**: Move Down (D) to (4,2).  \n  - Rationale: Proceeds to (4,1). (4,2) is now empty (tail has moved), so no collision.\n- **Turn 34**: Move Down (D) to (4,1) and eat the food (+1 score, length increases to 9).  \n  - Rationale: (4,1) has food with life span 10 (still valid). Eating it now secures the reward before focusing on (3,1).\n- **Turn 35**: Move Left (L) to (3,1) and eat the food (+1 score, length increases to 10).  \n  - Rationale: (3,1) must be eaten this turn (countdown=1; expires after turn 35). From (4,1) with direction Down, Left is valid (not reverse) and safe ((3,1) is empty). Eating both foods by turn 35 maximizes immediate score.\n\n### Risk Assessment:\n- **Collisions**: \n  - No body or wall collisions during the sequence (all target cells are empty: (4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (3,1)).\n  - Tail reward danger: When eating at (4,1) and (3,1), the tail is not adjacent (at (3,4) and later positions), so no collision risk.\n- **Food Access**: \n  - (3,1) is eaten just before expiration. (4,1) is eaten with turns to spare. (2,6) is ignored as it is not reachable by turn 37 without missing (3,1), and its value (+1) is less than the combined +2 from the bottom food.\n- **Long-term Survival**: \n  - After turn 35, the snake is at (3,1) with direction Left. From there, moves can include Up to (3,2) or Left to (2,1) to explore open areas (e.g., left side of grid), avoiding dead ends. The internal obstacle at (4,6) poses no immediate threat.\n\n### Answer Format:\nThe actions for turns 31 to 35 are output below. This sequence eats two food items, increasing the score by 2, and positions the snake for further safe movement.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 31: D \\\\\nTurn 32: D \\\\\nTurn 33: D \\\\\nTurn 34: D \\\\\nTurn 35: L\n}",

        "step": 32,

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 32. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: head at (4,4), then body segments: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2). So the snake is 8 segments long. Head direction is down, which is D, meaning it was moving down to (4,4) from (4,5)? Let's see the positions: the head is (4,4), and the first body segment is (4,5). Since head direction is D (down), that means it moved down to (4,4), so from (4,5) to (4,4) is down, yes.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (3,1) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (2,6) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (4,1) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food here. Value is 1 for all, and life span as given.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for at least 5 turns ahead, starting from turn 32. So I should decide moves for turns 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, and possibly beyond.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls: all border cells, so (0,y) for y=0-7, (7,y) for y=0-7, (x,0) for x=0-7, (x,7) for x=0-7. Also internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (4,4)\n\nBody: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)\n\nSo let's list all occupied cells by snake:\n\n- (4,4) head\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (3,5)\n\n- (2,5)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (3,2) tail\n\nTail is at (3,2).\n\nFood at:\n\n- (3,1) - below the tail? (3,1) is below (3,2) since y=1 < y=2, so south.\n\n- (2,6) - above (2,5)? (2,6) y=6, (2,5) y=5, so north.\n\n- (4,1) - below (4,4), but (4,4) is head, not directly below.\n\nCurrent head position (4,4), direction D (down). So last move was down to (4,4).\n\nPossible moves from (4,4): since direction is D, I can move L, R, or D, but not U because no instant reverse. Rule: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is D, so opposite is U, so I cannot move up next. So possible moves: L (left), R (right), D (down).\n\nNow, let's see the adjacent cells:\n\n- Left: (3,4) - but (3,4) is occupied by snake body. Is it safe? Let's see what happens when I move.\n\nRule: moving into body is deadly except if it's the tail and the tail moves away. Specifically, if I move to a cell that will be vacated by the tail, it's ok.\n\nIn this case, if I move left to (3,4), (3,4) is currently occupied by a body segment. But when I move, the snake moves: head moves to new position, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and tail moves away.\n\nSo if head moves to (3,4), which is currently occupied by the 6th segment? Let's index the positions.\n\nSnake positions: index 0: head (4,4)\n\nIndex 1: (4,5)\n\nIndex 2: (3,5)\n\nIndex 3: (2,5)\n\nIndex 4: (2,4)\n\nIndex 5: (3,4)\n\nIndex 6: (3,3)\n\nIndex 7: (3,2) tail\n\nIf head moves to (3,4), which is currently index 5. But after move, the new head will be at (3,4), and the body will shift: index 1 moves to (4,4), index 2 moves to (4,5), index 3 moves to (3,5), index 4 moves to (2,5), index 5 moves to (2,4), index 6 moves to (3,4)? No.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo new positions: head at new position, say (3,4).\n\nThen segment that was at index 1 moves to where head was, (4,4).\n\nSegment that was at index 2 moves to where index 1 was, (4,5).\n\nSegment that was at index 3 moves to where index 2 was, (3,5).\n\nSegment that was at index 4 moves to where index 3 was, (2,5).\n\nSegment that was at index 5 moves to where index 4 was, (2,4).\n\nSegment that was at index 6 moves to where index 5 was, (3,4)? Index 5 is (3,4), but (3,4) is where head is moving to? I think I confused.\n\nPositions before move:\n\n- Head: (4,4)\n\n- Body: pos1: (4,5), pos2: (3,5), pos3: (2,5), pos4: (2,4), pos5: (3,4), pos6: (3,3), pos7: (3,2)\n\nAfter head moves to (3,4):\n\n- New head: (3,4)\n\n- Then body: pos1 moves to old head position (4,4)\n\n- pos2 moves to old pos1 (4,5)\n\n- pos3 moves to old pos2 (3,5)\n\n- pos4 moves to old pos3 (2,5)\n\n- pos5 moves to old pos4 (2,4)\n\n- pos6 moves to old pos5 (3,4) — but (3,4) is where the new head is? Collision!\n\n(3,4) is occupied by the head after move, but pos6 is moving to old pos5, which is (3,4), but head is already there, so the cell (3,4) would have both head and body segment? That causes collision.\n\nRule: if head moves to a cell that is occupied by a body segment that will not move away, it collides.\n\nIn this case, when head moves to (3,4), which is currently occupied by pos5. After the move, pos5 is moving to (2,4), so (3,4) is vacated by pos5 before head moves there? Let's think step by step.\n\nWhen the snake moves:\n\n- The head moves first to the new cell.\n\n- Then each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the chain.\n\n- The tail segment leaves its position.\n\nIn this case, before move, (3,4) is occupied by pos5.\n\nHead moves to (3,4). At this moment, (3,4) is being moved to by head, but pos5 is still there? In terms of grid, when head moves to (3,4), if (3,4) was occupied, it might collide.\n\nThe rule says: deadly if head touches any body segment after the move.\n\nAfter the move, the positions are:\n\n- Head at (3,4)\n\n- Then pos1 at (4,4)  // old head position\n\n- pos2 at (4,5)  // old pos1\n\n- pos3 at (3,5)  // old pos2\n\n- pos4 at (2,5)  // old pos3\n\n- pos5 at (2,4)  // old pos4\n\n- pos6 at (3,4)  // old pos5, but old pos5 is (3,4), so pos6 moves to (3,4)\n\nBut (3,4) is where the head is, so head and pos6 are both at (3,4) after move, collision.\n\nYes, so moving to (3,4) causes collision because the body segment at (3,4) is not the tail; it's a middle segment, so it doesn't move away immediately; instead, another segment moves to it.\n\nThe tail is at (3,2), which is moving to old pos6 position (3,3).\n\nSo after move, (3,4) has head and the segment that was pos6 moving to it? No:\n\nNew positions:\n\n- Head: new position (3,4)\n\n- Body segment 1: old head position (4,4)\n\n- Body segment 2: old pos1 position (4,5)\n\n- Body segment 3: old pos2 position (3,5)\n\n- Body segment 4: old pos3 position (2,5)\n\n- Body segment 5: old pos4 position (2,4)\n\n- Body segment 6: old pos5 position (3,4)  // but (3,4) is the new head position, so collision.\n\nBody segment 6 is moving to old pos5, which is (3,4), but new head is at (3,4), so same cell, collision.\n\nTherefore, moving left to (3,4) is invalid and deadly.\n\nSimilarly, moving down to (4,3)? Let's see what is at (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is not in the snake positions, so it should be empty? Snake positions are (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2). So (4,3) is not occupied.\n\nAlso, walls: (4,3) is within bounds, x=4, y=3, not border or obstacle. Border is x=0,7 or y=0,7, so (4,3) is fine.\n\nMoving down to (4,3) should be possible.\n\nNow moving right to (5,4). (5,4) is not in snake positions, and within bounds? x=5, y=4, not border, no obstacle. Internal obstacle is (4,6), not here.\n\nSo possible moves from (4,4) with direction D:\n\n- L (left) to (3,4): but as above, collision, not possible.\n\n- R (right) to (5,4): seems empty.\n\n- D (down) to (4,3): seems empty.\n\nU (up) is not possible because opposite direction, cannot move up from down.\n\nSo only R or D are possible and safe for turn 32.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead multiple turns to maximize score, considering food life spans.\n\nFood:\n\n- (3,1): life span 4, so disappears after 4 turns, including current turn? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 32, life span 4, so it will disappear after turn 35? Let's clarify.\n\nLife span N: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases each turn, including current.\n\nSo at turn t, food with life span L will disappear after turn t + L - 1? Example: at turn t, life span L, after turn t, it decreases to L-1, and so on, until life span 0, then disappears before the next turn or after?\n\nThe rule: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nI think it means that at the start of turn t, if life span is L, after the turn, it decreases to L-1. When it reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n\nBut for eating, it can be eaten during a turn if head moves onto it.\n\nSo for food at (3,1) with life span 4 at turn 32:\n\n- After turn 32, life span becomes 3\n\n- After turn 33, life span becomes 2\n\n- After turn 34, life span becomes 1\n\n- After turn 35, life span becomes 0, disappears, so cannot be eaten on turn 36 or later. It can be eaten on turns 32,33,34,35, but after turn 35, it's gone.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) life span 6 at turn 32:\n\n- After turn 32: 5\n\n- Turn 33:4\n\n- Turn 34:3\n\n- Turn 35:2\n\n- Turn 36:1\n\n- Turn 37:0, disappears\n\n(4,1) life span 9 at turn 32:\n\n- After turn 32:8\n\n- Turn 33:7\n\n- ... up to after turn 40:0, disappears.\n\nNow, the snake head is at (4,4). Food at (3,1) is at (3,1), which is down and left, but (3,1) is below (3,2) tail.\n\n(2,6) is at (2,6), which is above (2,5) body.\n\n(4,1) is at (4,1), directly below (4,4) head? (4,4) to (4,1) is down 3 steps, but y=1 is south.\n\nGrid: y=0 bottom, y=7 top? Usually in coordinates, y increases up or down? The movement: U (x,y+1) so y+1 is up, so y increases upwards, I assume. So (x,y) with y=0 bottom, y=7 top.\n\nSo (4,4) to (4,1): y=1 < y=4, so south, down direction.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) y=1, (2,6) y=6 high.\n\nNow, to eat (3,1), which is at (3,1), near the tail at (3,2).\n\nBut there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, the food is at (3,1), tail is at (3,2). If head moves to (3,1) when tail is at (3,2), they are adjacent? (3,1) and (3,2) are adjacent vertically.\n\nIf head eats food at (3,1), and tail is at (3,2), after eating, snake grows, so new tail is added, but the tail segment moves away only if no growth.\n\nWhen snake eats food, it grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n\nRule: when eating positive food, length increases by one, so after moving, the tail stays, and a new segment is added at the tail position? Or where?\n\nStandard: when snake eats food, the head moves to the food cell, and instead of removing the tail, the tail stays, so snake grows by one segment.\n\nSo positions: head moves to food cell, body segments move as usual, but tail is not removed; so a new segment is added at the position where the tail was before moving? Let's think.\n\nBefore move: head, body, tail.\n\nWhen head moves to a cell with food, it eats it, so the snake grows: the head moves to the new cell (food), each body segment moves to previous position, and the tail does not move; it stays, and a new segment is added at the old tail position? No.\n\nTypically: after movement, if food eaten, a new segment is added at the tail position before movement.\n\nSo: head moves to new position (food cell), then body segments shift: each moves to previous segment's position, and since food eaten, the tail position before movement becomes a new body segment, and the tail remains there; so the snake grows by one segment at the tail end.\n\nIn terms of positions: suppose tail is at P before move. After move, the segment that was at P is still there as part of body, and no segment is removed, so the tail is now at P, but it's the new last segment.\n\nFor example, if snake has segments [H, B1, B2, T], and H moves to food F.\n\nAfter: new positions [F, H_old, B1_old, B2_old], and T position is now part of body, with T still at its position? Let's index.\n\nBefore: index 0: H at position A\n\nIndex 1: B1 at B\n\nIndex 2: B2 at C\n\nIndex 3: T at D\n\nHead moves to F, which has food.\n\nAfter move: new head at F\n\nIndex 1 moves to A (old H)\n\nIndex 2 moves to B (old B1)\n\nIndex 3 moves to C (old B2)\n\nAnd since food eaten, a new segment is added at D (old T position), so new positions: [F, A, B, C, D] with D as new tail.\n\nThe old tail position D now has a new segment.\n\nIn this case, for tail reward danger: if the head is adjacent to the tail, and the tail cell has food, eating it is dangerous.\n\nSpecifically: if head moves to a cell that is adjacent to tail, and that cell has food, but the food is on the cell head moves to, not on tail cell.\n\nThe rule: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills\"\n\nIt says \"tail cell has positive food\", meaning food on the tail position.\n\nAnd \"eating it\" means eating the food on the tail position.\n\nBut to eat food on tail position, head must move to the tail position.\n\nBut tail position is occupied by tail, so normally head cannot move there because it's occupied.\n\nBut the rule says: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\"\n\nSo for food under tail, it can be eaten if tail moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nIn this case, for food at (3,1), which is under the body? Snake positions include (3,2) tail, but (3,1) is not occupied by snake; food is at (3,1), tail at (3,2), so (3,1) is empty, not under body.\n\n(3,1) is not in snake positions, so it's free, head can move there directly.\n\nBut the tail reward danger applies when head moves to eat food that is on the tail cell, but here food is at (3,1), tail at (3,2), different cells.\n\nSo for (3,1), if head moves to (3,1), it can eat the food since it's not under body.\n\nBut the danger might be if after eating, the tail is adjacent or something.\n\nTail reward danger: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills\"\n\nIn this scenario, head moving to (3,1), tail at (3,2), so they are adjacent before the move? (3,1) and (3,2) are adjacent, but head is at (4,4) now, not adjacent to tail.\n\nAfter move, if head moves to (3,1), and tail is at (3,2), then they are adjacent after move.\n\nBut the rule says \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food\", but here tail cell is (3,2), which has no food; food is at (3,1).\n\nSo for (3,1), it should be safe to eat, as long as no collision.\n\nBut after eating, the snake grows, so the new tail is at (3,2), and head is at (3,1), so they are adjacent, but that's normal, not necessarily dangerous, unless the head then moves into the tail, but it's not an immediate collision.\n\nThe rule specifies only when eating food on the tail cell itself.\n\nLet me read carefully: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nSo it requires two conditions: head adjacent to tail, and tail cell has food. Then if you eat that food (on the tail cell), it kills.\n\nIn this case, for food at (3,1), it's not on the tail cell, so no danger from this rule.\n\nSimilarly for other food.\n\nSo back to possible moves.\n\nAt turn 32, from (4,4), possible safe moves: R to (5,4) or D to (4,3).\n\nNow, I need to plan multiple turns.\n\nFood (3,1) has short life, only 4 turns left, so I might want to eat it soon.\n\n(2,6) has 6 turns, (4,1) has 9, so plenty of time.\n\nAlso, there's an obstacle at (4,6), which is above.\n\nLet me sketch the grid mentally.\n\nGrid 8x8, walls at borders.\n\nSnake: head (4,4), body to (3,2) tail.\n\nFood: (3,1) - below tail, (2,6) - north of (2,5), (4,1) - south of head.\n\nTo reach (3,1) from (4,4): one way is to go left then down, but left to (3,4) is blocked, as we saw. So from (4,4), I can go down to (4,3), then left to (3,3), but (3,3) is occupied by snake body? Positions: (3,3) is index 6, which is a body segment.\n\nIf I go from (4,4) down to (4,3), then from (4,3) I can go left to (3,3), but (3,3) is occupied.\n\nIf I move to (3,3) from (4,3), (3,3) is currently occupied by pos6.\n\nAfter move, if head at (3,3), then body: pos1 to (4,4), pos2 to (4,5), etc., and pos6 to old pos5 position.\n\nOld pos5 is (3,4), so pos6 moves to (3,4).\n\nBut (3,3) was pos6, which moves away, so head can move to (3,3) if it's the tail or if it moves away.\n\nIn this case, (3,3) is occupied by pos6, which is not tail; tail is at (3,2).\n\nAfter head moves to (3,3), new positions: head at (3,3), pos1 at (4,4), pos2 at (4,5), pos3 at (3,5), pos4 at (2,5), pos5 at (2,4), pos6 at (3,4)  // old pos5 (3,4)\n\nAnd tail at (3,2) moves to old pos6 position (3,3)? Old pos6 is (3,3), which is where head is moving to? Similar issue.\n\nBefore move: head at (4,4), pos1 (4,5), pos2 (3,5), pos3 (2,5), pos4 (2,4), pos5 (3,4), pos6 (3,3), pos7 (3,2)\n\nIf head moves to (3,3):\n\n- New head at (3,3)\n\n- Then pos1 moves to (4,4)\n\n- pos2 moves to (4,5)  // old pos1\n\n- pos3 moves to (3,5)  // old pos2\n\n- pos4 moves to (2,5)  // old pos3\n\n- pos5 moves to (2,4)  // old pos4\n\n- pos6 moves to (3,4)  // old pos5\n\n- pos7 (tail) moves to old pos6 (3,3)  // but (3,3) is new head position, so head and pos7 both at (3,3), collision.\n\nTherefore, moving to (3,3) from (4,3) would cause collision because pos6 is moving to (3,4), but the head is moving to (3,3), and tail is moving to (3,3), so conflict.\n\nSpecifically, the cell (3,3) is the target for head and also for the tail movement? After move, head at (3,3), and tail moves to old pos6 position, which is (3,3), so yes, collision.\n\nSo (3,3) cannot be moved to because it's occupied and the occupant is not moving away in a way that vacates it for head.\n\nSimilarly, only cells that are empty or occupied by the tail can be moved to, but only if the tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, for (3,3), it's occupied by a middle segment, so not safe.\n\nFrom (4,4), down to (4,3) is safe, as (4,3) is empty.\n\nThen from (4,3), I can go down to (4,2), left to (3,3) but not safe, or right to (5,3).\n\n(5,3) might be empty.\n\nLet's list free cells around.\n\nFirst, for turn 32, I need to choose between R and D.\n\nIf I go right to (5,4), then I can later go down or up, but up might not be good.\n\nIf I go down to (4,3), I can go towards (4,1) or (3,1).\n\nBut (3,1) is close, life span short.\n\nLet's think about path to (3,1).\n\nFrom head (4,4) to (3,1): the direct path is left to (3,4) but blocked, or down to (4,3) then left to (3,3) but (3,3) occupied, so I need to go around.\n\nFor example, down to (4,3), then down to (4,2), then left to (3,2), but (3,2) is tail.\n\nTail at (3,2), so if I move to (3,2), it might be possible if the tail moves away.\n\nIf head moves to (3,2) from, say, (3,3) or (4,2).\n\nBut currently, from (4,4), I can only go to (5,4) or (4,3).\n\nSuppose at turn 32, I go down to (4,3).\n\nThen at turn 33, head at (4,3), direction now D (since moved down).\n\nFrom (4,3), possible moves: L to (3,3), but (3,3) is occupied by pos6, which is body, and as before, moving to (3,3) causes collision because tail moves there or something.\n\nPositions after turn 32: if head moves D to (4,3), then new head (4,3), pos1 to (4,4), pos2 to (4,5), pos3 to (3,5), pos4 to (2,5), pos5 to (2,4), pos6 to (3,4), pos7 to (3,3)? Let's calculate.\n\nBefore turn 32 move: positions: H(4,4), p1(4,5), p2(3,5), p3(2,5), p4(2,4), p5(3,4), p6(3,3), p7(3,2)\n\nHead moves D to (4,3)\n\nNew positions:\n\n- Head: (4,3)\n\n- p1 moves to old H: (4,4)\n\n- p2 moves to old p1: (4,5)\n\n- p3 moves to old p2: (3,5)\n\n- p4 moves to old p3: (2,5)\n\n- p5 moves to old p4: (2,4)\n\n- p6 moves to old p5: (3,4)\n\n- p7 moves to old p6: (3,3)\n\nSo tail is now at (3,3)\n\nFood at (3,1) is still there, life span now 3 after turn 32.\n\nAt turn 33, head at (4,3), direction D (since moved down).\n\nPossible moves: U, L, R, but not D? Current direction D, so cannot move U (up), so possible L (left to (3,3)), R (right to (5,3)), D (down to (4,2)).\n\nNow, (3,3) is occupied by tail p7 at (3,3).\n\nIf head moves to (3,3), which is tail position.\n\nSince it's tail, and tail will move away if no food eaten.\n\nIf head moves to (3,3), and (3,3) has no food (food is at (3,1), not here), so no growth, tail moves away.\n\nAfter move: head at (3,3), then p1 moves to (4,3), p2 to (4,4), p3 to (4,5), p4 to (3,5), p5 to (2,5), p6 to (2,4), p7 moves to old p6 position (3,4)\n\nSo (3,3) is vacated by tail, and head moves in, no collision.\n\nSo moving to (3,3) is safe at turn 33 if I go left from (4,3).\n\nSimilarly, moving down to (4,2) or right to (5,3) also safe.\n\n(4,2) should be empty.\n\n(5,3) empty.\n\nNow, to reach (3,1), I can go to (3,3) then down to (3,2) or (3,1) directly? (3,1) is below.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can move down to (3,2), but (3,2) is where the tail was, but after turn 33, tail is at (3,4)? After turn 32, tail at (3,3), then at turn 33, if head moves to (3,3), tail moves to (3,4), so (3,2) is empty.\n\nLet's see positions after turn 32: head (4,3), p1 (4,4), p2 (4,5), p3 (3,5), p4 (2,5), p5 (2,4), p6 (3,4), p7 (3,3) tail\n\nAt turn 33, if head moves L to (3,3): since (3,3) is tail, and no food there, tail moves away to old p6 position (3,4).\n\nNew head at (3,3)\n\np1 moves to (4,3)\n\np2 moves to (4,4)\n\np3 moves to (4,5)\n\np4 moves to (3,5)\n\np5 moves to (2,5)\n\np6 moves to (2,4)\n\np7 moves to (3,4)  // old p6 position\n\nSo (3,2) is free.\n\nThen at turn 34, head at (3,3), direction L (since moved left from (4,3)? From (4,3) to (3,3) is left, so direction now L.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, but not R (opposite).\n\nU to (3,4), D to (3,2), L to (2,3), etc.\n\n(3,4) is occupied by p7 tail? After turn 33, positions: head (3,3), p1 (4,3), p2 (4,4), p3 (4,5), p4 (3,5), p5 (2,5), p6 (2,4), p7 (3,4)\n\nSo (3,4) has p7, which is tail.\n\nIf head moves U to (3,4), it is tail position.\n\nIf no food, tail moves away.\n\n(3,4) has no food, so head can move to (3,4), tail moves to old p6 position (2,4).\n\nSimilarly, move D to (3,2), which should be empty.\n\nMove L to (2,3), which might be empty or not; (2,3) not in positions, so empty.\n\nNow, to eat (3,1), I can go down to (3,2) at turn 34, then down to (3,1) at turn 35.\n\nAt turn 34, head at (3,3), move D to (3,2).\n\n(3,2) is empty, so safe.\n\nAfter move: head at (3,2), p1 to (3,3), p2 to (4,3), etc., tail moves to (3,4) or something.\n\nThen at turn 35, head at (3,2), move D to (3,1), which has food, so eat it.\n\nLife span: at turn 35, before move, life span of (3,1) is? At turn 32 start, life span 4.\n\nAfter turn 32, life span 3; after turn 33, life span 2; after turn 34, life span 1; after turn 35, life span 0, disappears. So on turn 35, it can be eaten before it disappears.\n\nIf head moves to (3,1) on turn 35, it eats it.\n\nThen snake grows, so new tail added.\n\nNow, is there any danger? Head at (3,1), tail was at some position, but not adjacent in a way that causes issue.\n\nTail reward danger only if eating food on tail cell when head adjacent.\n\nHere, food on (3,1), not on tail cell.\n\nSo should be fine.\n\nBut let's confirm the path.\n\nFirst, at turn 32, I need to go down to (4,3) to start this path.\n\nI could go right to (5,4), but that might not reach (3,1) in time.\n\n(3,1) life span: can be eaten up to turn 35.\n\nIf I go down at turn 32 to (4,3), then at turn 33 to (3,3), at turn 34 to (3,2), at turn 35 to (3,1), eat.\n\nPerfect, 4 turns: 32,33,34,35.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows, so positions: after turn 35, head at (3,1), body longer.\n\nNow, what about other food? (2,6) at (2,6), which is north, and (4,1) south.\n\n(4,1) has life span 9, plenty of time.\n\n(2,6) has life span 6, at turn 32, after turn 32:5, turn33:4, turn34:3, turn35:2, turn36:1, turn37:0. So can be eaten up to turn 37.\n\nAfter eating (3,1) at turn 35, I can go for (2,6) or (4,1).\n\nBut (2,6) is at (2,6), which might be reachable.\n\nNow, after turn 35, head at (3,1), and snake has grown.\n\nBut let's not get ahead; first, for the initial moves.\n\nAt turn 32, if I go right to (5,4), then I might not reach (3,1) in time, since from (5,4) to (3,1) is farther, and with obstacles, it might take more than 3 turns to reach, but only 3 turns left to eat: turn 33,34,35.\n\nFrom (5,4) to (3,1): need to go left and down, but snake body might be in the way.\n\nFor example, from (5,4), go left to (4,4) but (4,4) might be occupied after move.\n\nAt turn 32, if go R to (5,4), new positions: head (5,4), p1 (4,4), p2 (4,5), etc., so (4,4) occupied.\n\nThen to go to (3,1), I need to go through (4,3) or something, but it might take time.\n\nFor instance, from (5,4), turn 32: to (5,4)\n\nTurn 33: can go L to (4,4) but occupied? After turn 32, positions: head (5,4), p1 (4,4), p2 (4,5), p3 (3,5), p4 (2,5), p5 (2,4), p6 (3,4), p7 (3,3), tail (3,3)? After turn 32 move: from H(4,4) to (5,4), so new head (5,4), p1 to (4,4), p2 to (4,5), p3 to (3,5), p4 to (2,5), p5 to (2,4), p6 to (3,4), p7 to (3,3)  // old p6? Old p6 was (3,3), p7 moves to that.\n\nBefore: H(4,4), p1(4,5), p2(3,5), p3(2,5), p4(2,4), p5(3,4), p6(3,3), p7(3,2)\n\nHead to (5,4)\n\np1 to (4,4)\n\np2 to (4,5)  // old p1\n\np3 to (3,5)  // old p2\n\np4 to (2,5)  // old p3\n\np5 to (2,4)  // old p4\n\np6 to (3,4)  // old p5\n\np7 to (3,3)  // old p6\n\nSo tail at (3,3)\n\nNow at turn 33, head at (5,4), direction R (since moved right).\n\nPossible moves: U, D, R, not L (opposite).\n\nU to (5,5), D to (5,3), R to (6,4)\n\n(5,5) might be empty, (5,3) empty, (6,4) within bounds? x=6, not 7, so ok.\n\nTo reach (3,1), I need to go left and down.\n\nBut from (5,4), going left to (4,4) is not possible because it's occupied and direction: current direction R, cannot move L immediately.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can go down to (5,3), then left to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut (4,3) might be free.\n\nAt turn 33, go D to (5,3)\n\nThen turn 34, head at (5,3), direction D.\n\nThen go L to (4,3)? (4,3) might be occupied? After turn 33, if head to (5,3), positions: head (5,3), p1 to (5,4), p2 to (4,4), p3 to (4,5), etc.\n\np1 to old head (5,4)? After turn 33 move: from (5,4) to (5,3), new head (5,3), p1 to (5,4), p2 to (4,4), p3 to (4,5), p4 to (3,5), p5 to (2,5), p6 to (2,4), p7 to (3,4), tail at (3,4)\n\nThen at turn 34, head at (5,3), can go L to (4,3)\n\n(4,3) should be empty.\n\nThen move to (4,3)\n\nThen at turn 35, head at (4,3), direction L (left), can go L to (3,3) or D to (4,2), etc.\n\nBut (3,3) might be occupied? After turn 34, if head to (4,3), new positions: head (4,3), p1 to (5,3), p2 to (5,4), p3 to (4,4), p4 to (4,5), p5 to (3,5), p6 to (2,5), p7 to (2,4), tail at (2,4)? p7 to (2,4)\n\nThen (3,3) is free? Not occupied, so from (4,3) at turn 35, I can go L to (3,3), but (3,3) is empty, so safe.\n\nBut (3,1) is at (3,1), from (3,3) I need to go to (3,2) then (3,1), but at turn 35, if I go to (3,3), then turn 36 to (3,2), turn 37 to (3,1), but (3,1) disappears after turn 35, so on turn 36 it is gone, cannot eat on turn 36 or later.\n\nAfter turn 35, life span 0, so before turn 36 it disappears, cannot eat on turn 36.\n\nTurn 35 is the last chance to eat (3,1).\n\nIn this path, at turn 35, I am at (4,3), and (3,1) is two steps away: I need to go to (3,3) or (4,2), but (3,3) is empty, but from (4,3) to (3,3) is left, then from (3,3) to (3,2) down, but (3,2) might be free, but I cannot reach (3,1) on same turn.\n\nOn turn 35, from (4,3), I can only move to adjacent cells: (3,3), (5,3), or (4,2), or (4,4) but occupied, etc. Cannot reach (3,1) directly.\n\nSo I cannot eat (3,1) if I go right at turn 32.\n\nTherefore, to eat (3,1), I must go down at turn 32 to (4,3).\n\nThen proceed as before to eat it on turn 35.\n\nNow, after that, I can plan for other food.\n\nBut I need to output 5 turns: turns 32 to 36? Turn t1=32, so actions for turn 32,33,34,35,36.\n\nIn the path to eat (3,1), turn 32: D to (4,3)\n\nTurn 33: L to (3,3)\n\nTurn 34: D to (3,2)\n\nTurn 35: D to (3,1) eat\n\nThen turn 36: from (3,1), after eating, snake has grown, so positions after turn 35: head at (3,1), and since ate food, new segment added.\n\nAfter turn 34: let's track positions.\n\nAt turn 32: move D to (4,3)\n\nPositions after turn 32:\n\n- Head: (4,3)\n\n- p1: (4,4)  // old head\n\n- p2: (4,5)  // old p1\n\n- p3: (3,5)  // old p2\n\n- p4: (2,5)  // old p3\n\n- p5: (2,4)  // old p4\n\n- p6: (3,4)  // old p5\n\n- p7: (3,3)  // old p6, tail\n\nTail at (3,3)\n\nAt turn 33: move L to (3,3)  // left from (4,3) to (3,3)\n\nSince moving to tail position, and no food there (food at (3,1)), so tail moves away.\n\nNew positions:\n\n- Head: (3,3)\n\n- p1: (4,3)  // old head (4,3)\n\n- p2: (4,4)  // old p1 (4,4)\n\n- p3: (4,5)  // old p2 (4,5)\n\n- p4: (3,5)  // old p3 (3,5)\n\n- p5: (2,5)  // old p4 (2,5)\n\n- p6: (2,4)  // old p5 (2,4)? Old p5 was (2,4), p6 moves to that.\n\nAfter turn 32, p5 is at (2,4)? From above: after turn 32, p5: (2,4), p6: (3,4), p7: (3,3)\n\nBetter to list all:\n\nAfter turn 32: segments:\n\n0: head (4,3)\n\n1: (4,4)  // was p1, now index 1\n\n2: (4,5)  // was p2\n\n3: (3,5)  // was p3\n\n4: (2,5)  // was p4\n\n5: (2,4)  // was p5\n\n6: (3,4)  // was p6\n\n7: (3,3)  // was p7, tail\n\nAt turn 33, head moves L to (3,3)\n\n(3,3) is tail, so head moves to (3,3), no food there, so tail moves to old position of segment 6, which is (3,4)\n\nNew positions:\n\n- Head: (3,3)\n\n- Segment 1: old head position (4,3)\n\n- Segment 2: old seg1 position (4,4)\n\n- Segment 3: old seg2 position (4,5)\n\n- Segment 4: old seg3 position (3,5)\n\n- Segment 5: old seg4 position (2,5)\n\n- Segment 6: old seg5 position (2,4)\n\n- Segment 7: old seg6 position (3,4)  // tail now at (3,4)\n\nSo tail at (3,4)\n\nAt turn 34: head at (3,3), direction L (since moved left from (4,3)? From (4,3) to (3,3) is left, so direction now L.\n\nMove D to (3,2)  // down\n\n(3,2) should be empty.\n\nNew positions:\n\n- Head: (3,2)\n\n- Seg1: old head (3,3)\n\n- Seg2: old seg1 (4,3)\n\n- Seg3: old seg2 (4,4)\n\n- Seg4: old seg3 (4,5)\n\n- Seg5: old seg4 (3,5)\n\n- Seg6: old seg5 (2,5)\n\n- Seg7: old seg6 (2,4)  // tail at (2,4)\n\nAt turn 35: head at (3,2), direction D (down).\n\nMove D to (3,1)  // down to (3,1), which has food.\n\nEat food, so snake grows.\n\nNew positions: head moves to (3,1), then:\n\n- Seg1 moves to old head (3,2)\n\n- Seg2 moves to old seg1 (3,3)\n\n- Seg3 moves to old seg2 (4,3)\n\n- Seg4 moves to old seg3 (4,4)\n\n- Seg5 moves to old seg4 (4,5)\n\n- Seg6 moves to old seg5 (3,5)\n\n- Seg7 moves to old seg6 (2,5)\n\nAnd since food eaten, a new segment is added at old tail position (2,4), so now snake has 9 segments: head at (3,1), then (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), and new tail at (2,4)\n\nPositions: index 0: (3,1), 1: (3,2), 2: (3,3), 3: (4,3), 4: (4,4), 5: (4,5), 6: (3,5), 7: (2,5), 8: (2,4) tail.\n\nNow, at turn 36, head at (3,1), direction D (down).\n\nPossible moves: since direction D, cannot move U, so possible L, R, D.\n\nL to (2,1), R to (4,1), D to (3,0) but y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n\nWalls: y=0 is border, so (3,0) is wall, cannot move there.\n\nR to (4,1), which has food, but let's see.\n\n(4,1) has food with value 1.\n\nIf I move to (4,1), I can eat it.\n\nBut is it safe? (4,1) is not occupied, so yes.\n\nThen I would eat two food in a row.\n\nBut long-term, I need to survive.\n\nNow, (2,6) food is still there.\n\nAfter turn 36, if I go to (4,1), eat it, snake grows again.\n\nBut let's see the actions up to turn 36.\n\nIn the plan, turn 32: D\n\nTurn 33: L\n\nTurn 34: D\n\nTurn 35: D to (3,1) eat\n\nThen turn 36: from (3,1), I can move R to (4,1) to eat the other food.\n\n(4,1) has life span 9, at turn 32, after turn 35: life span? Turn 32:9, after 32:8, 33:7, 34:6, 35:5, so still 5 left, plenty.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) at turn 35: life span? Turn 32:6, after 32:5, 33:4, 34:3, 35:2, so after turn 35, life span 2, can be eaten on turn 36 or 37.\n\nBut at turn 36, from (3,1), I can go to (4,1) or to (2,1), or down but wall.\n\n(2,1) might be empty.\n\nBut (4,1) has food, so eating it gives score.\n\nAlso, after eating, I can navigate to other areas.\n\nBut there might be a risk: after eating (3,1) and (4,1), the snake is longer, might be harder to move.\n\nBut let's see the positions.\n\nAfter turn 35: head at (3,1), body to (2,4)\n\nNow, (4,1) is at (4,1), adjacent right.\n\nIf I move R to (4,1) at turn 36, eat it.\n\nThen new head at (4,1), and new segment added at old tail (2,4).\n\nPositions: head to (4,1), seg1 to (3,1), seg2 to (3,2), seg3 to (3,3), seg4 to (4,3), seg5 to (4,4), seg6 to (4,5), seg7 to (3,5), seg8 to (2,5), and new seg9 at (2,4) tail.\n\nNow, head at (4,1), direction R (since moved right from (3,1)).\n\nThen I need to move away, but I can go up or left, not down or right? y=1, down to (4,0) wall, right to (5,1) possible.\n\nCurrent direction R, so cannot move L (opposite), so can move U, D, R.\n\nD to (4,0) wall, invalid.\n\nU to (4,2), or R to (5,1).\n\n(4,2) might be occupied? After above, positions: head (4,1), body: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), tail (2,4)\n\nSo (4,2) is free.\n\nSimilarly (5,1) free.\n\nSo I can move U to (4,2) or R to (5,1).\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut for now, with this plan, I eat two food.\n\nI could go for (2,6) instead.\n\nBut (2,6) is at (2,6), which is far from (3,1).\n\nAt turn 36, from (3,1), I could move L to (2,1), then up to (2,2), etc., towards (2,6).\n\nBut (2,6) life span: after turn 35, life span 2, so must eat by turn 36 or 37.\n\nTurn 36: if I move L to (2,1), then at turn 37, I need to go to (2,6), but (2,6) is at (2,6), from (2,1) to (2,6) is 5 steps up, but with body, I might not reach in one move.\n\nFrom (2,1) to (2,6), need to go up, but y from 1 to 6, 5 steps, but I can only move one per turn.\n\nAt turn 37, from (2,1), I can go to (2,2), then turn 38 to (2,3), etc., cannot reach (2,6) by turn 37.\n\nAfter turn 35, head at (3,1), to reach (2,6): (2,6) is at x=2,y=6.\n\nFrom (3,1), one way is to go to (2,1), then (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), but (2,4) might be occupied, etc.\n\nSpecifically, at turn 36: from (3,1) move L to (2,1)  // assuming (2,1) empty\n\nThen turn 37: from (2,1) move U to (2,2)\n\nBut at turn 37, (2,6) life span: after turn 35, life span 2? At turn 32: life span 6\n\nAfter turn 32:5\n\n33:4\n\n34:3\n\n35:2\n\nAfter turn 35: life span 1? Countdown: after each turn, decrease.\n\nAt start of turn 36, life span of (2,6) is 1 (since after turn 35 it decreased from 2 to 1)\n\nAfter turn 36: decreases to 0, disappears.\n\nSo can be eaten on turn 36, but not later.\n\nOn turn 36, (2,6) can be eaten if head moves there.\n\nBut from (3,1) at turn 36, (2,6) is not adjacent; it's at (2,6), (3,1) to (2,6) is not close.\n\nDistance: |dx|=1, |dy|=5, so not reachable in one move.\n\nTherefore, I cannot eat (2,6) on turn 36; it must be eaten by turn 36, so only possible on turn 36 if I can reach it, but I can't from (3,1).\n\nAfter turn 35, head at (3,1), (2,6) is at distance, cannot reach in one turn, and after turn 36 it disappears, so I miss (2,6) if I don't eat it earlier.\n\nIn the initial plan, I ate (3,1) on turn 35, but (2,6) was not eaten.\n\nPerhaps I should consider eating (2,6) first.\n\nBut (2,6) has life span 6, can be eaten up to turn 37, but with the path to (3,1), I might not reach (2,6) in time.\n\n(2,6) at (2,6), head at (4,4) turn 32.\n\nTo reach (2,6), need to go left and up.\n\nFor example, from (4,4), go left but blocked, so go down to (4,3), then left? But earlier we have to go to (3,3) etc.\n\nFrom (4,4), turn 32 down to (4,3)\n\nThen turn 33, instead of left to (3,3), I could go down to (4,2), then left to (3,2) or something.\n\nBut (3,2) is tail, but after turn 32, tail at (3,3), so (3,2) free? After turn 32: positions as before, (3,2) not occupied.\n\nAt turn 33, head at (4,3), move D to (4,2)\n\nThen turn 34, from (4,2) move L to (3,2)\n\nThen turn 35, from (3,2) move U to (3,3)? But (3,3) might be occupied later.\n\nBut to reach (2,6), from (3,2) I need to go up to (3,3), (3,4), etc., but (2,6) is at (2,6), so I need to go left to (2,2) or something.\n\nFrom (3,2) at turn 35, I can go L to (2,2), then U to (2,3), U to (2,4), but (2,4) might have body, etc.\n\nIt would take several turns, and (2,6) must be eaten by turn 37.\n\nTurn 35: at (3,2), move L to (2,2)\n\nTurn 36: from (2,2) move U to (2,3)\n\nTurn 37: from (2,3) move U to (2,4), but if (2,4) is occupied, or I need to go to (2,5), (2,6).\n\nBut (2,6) can be eaten on turn 37 if I reach it.\n\nLife span: after turn 37, it disappears? At turn 37, before move, life span 1? Let's calculate.\n\n(2,6) life span at turn 32:6\n\nAfter turn 32:5\n\n33:4\n\n34:3\n\n35:2\n\n36:1\n\n37:0, disappears after turn 37.\n\nSo can be eaten on turn 37 if head moves to it before it disappears.\n\nOn turn 37, if I move to (2,6), I can eat it.\n\nSimilarly, from above, if I go to (2,3) on turn 36, then on turn 37 to (2,4) or (2,5) or (2,6).\n\n(2,6) is at (2,6), so from (2,3) I can go U to (2,4), but not directly to (2,6).\n\nNeed to go through (2,4), (2,5), then (2,6).\n\nSo turn 37: to (2,4), turn 38: to (2,5), turn 39: to (2,6), but on turn 39, (2,6) is gone.\n\nAfter turn 37 it disappears, so last chance turn 37.\n\nBut on turn 37, from (2,3), I can only move to (2,4), (1,3), (3,3), or (2,2), not to (2,6).\n\nCannot reach (2,6) on turn 37 from (2,3).\n\nTherefore, to eat (2,6), I need to be closer earlier.\n\nFor example, if at turn 32 I go to (5,4), then I can go up or something, but (2,6) is left, might not be efficient.\n\nPerhaps I should give up on (2,6) and focus on (3,1) and (4,1).\n\nSince (2,6) might be hard to reach without risk, and (3,1) is easy to get with the down-left path.\n\nMoreover, (4,1) is also easy to get after that.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for 5 turns: 32 to 36.\n\nIn the plan:\n\nTurn 32: D (down to (4,3))\n\nTurn 33: L (left to (3,3))\n\nTurn 34: D (down to (3,2))\n\nTurn 35: D (down to (3,1) eat)\n\nThen turn 36: from (3,1), as above, I can move R to (4,1) to eat that food as well.\n\n(4,1) is at (4,1), adjacent right, and empty.\n\nMove R to (4,1), eat.\n\nThen snake grows.\n\nAfter that, I can move U or R, etc.\n\nBut for turn 36, action is R.\n\nNow, is there any risk in moving to (4,1)? Should be fine.\n\nI could move L to (2,1), but no food there, so better to eat food.\n\nThus, actions:\n\nTurn 32: D\n\nTurn 33: L\n\nTurn 34: D\n\nTurn 35: D\n\nTurn 36: R\n\nIn the sequence, turn 36 is R to (4,1).\n\nNow, to confirm, after turn 36, positions will be as before.\n\nBut I think this is a good plan.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the internal obstacle at (4,6), but it's not in the way for now.\n\nSo I think this maximizes score by eating two food quickly.\n\n(2,6) will disappear, but I might not be able to get it safely.\n\nTherefore, the actions should be:\n\nTurn 32: D (down)\n\nTurn 33: L (left)\n\nTurn 34: D (down)\n\nTurn 35: D (down)\n\nTurn 36: R (right)\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nNow, for the boxed answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, the AI plans at least 5 turns ahead, starting from turn 32. The strategy focuses on eating the positive food at (3,1) due to its short remaining life span (4 turns at turn 32, disappearing after turn 35), while avoiding collisions and considering other food opportunities. The food at (2,6) has a life span of 6 turns (disappearing after turn 37) but is not prioritized due to the distance and risk of not reaching it in time. The food at (4,1) has a long life span (9 turns) and can be eaten opportunistically after securing (3,1).\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Current State (Turn 32)**:\n  - Snake head at (4,4), direction D (down).\n  - Possible safe moves from (4,4): R (right to (5,4)) or D (down to (4,3)). L (left to (3,4)) causes collision with the body.\n  - Food (3,1) must be eaten by turn 35 to avoid loss.\n  - Path to (3,1): Requires moving down to (4,3) on turn 32, then left to (3,3) on turn 33, down to (3,2) on turn 34, and down to (3,1) on turn 35 to eat it.\n  - After eating (3,1), the snake grows, and (4,1) is adjacent and can be eaten on turn 36 by moving right from (3,1).\n- **Collision Avoidance**: All moves are checked for body/wall collisions. For example:\n  - Moving to (3,3) on turn 33 is safe because it is the tail position and the tail moves away.\n  - Moving to (3,1) on turn 35 is safe; no tail reward danger as the food is not on the tail cell.\n- **Food Life Spans**:\n  - (3,1): Life span 4 at turn 32 → decreases to 3 after turn 32, 2 after turn 33, 1 after turn 34, 0 after turn 35 (disappears).\n  - (2,6): Life span 6 at turn 32 → decreases to 5 after turn 32, etc., but not reachable by turn 37 without risk.\n  - (4,1): Life span 9 at turn 32 → plenty of time; can be eaten on turn 36.\n- **Movement Constraints**: No instant reverse (e.g., from direction D, cannot move U next). Wall collisions avoided (borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7; internal obstacle at (4,6)).\n\n### Plan Details (Turns 32-36):\n1. **Turn 32**: Move D (down to (4,3)) to start path toward (3,1). Avoids right move which would delay reaching (3,1). Safe and empty cell.\n2. **Turn 33**: Move L (left to (3,3)). (3,3) is tail position; tail moves away, no collision. Direction now L.\n3. **Turn 34**: Move D (down to (3,2)). (3,2) is empty. Direction now D.\n4. **Turn 35**: Move D (down to (3,1)). Eat food (value +1, snake grows). (3,1) is eaten just before it disappears. Direction now D.\n5. **Turn 36**: Move R (right to (4,1)). Eat food (value +1, snake grows). (4,1) is adjacent and empty; no risk. Direction now R.\n\nThis sequence eats two positive food items, increasing the score by 2 and the snake length by 2, while ensuring survival. The food at (2,6) is forfeited due to distance and time constraints, but this is acceptable as (3,1) was time-sensitive and (4,1) provides additional reward with low risk. After turn 36, the snake can navigate open areas (e.g., move up to (4,2) or right to (5,1)) for future food or survival.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 32: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 33: \\text{ L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 34: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 35: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 36: \\text{ R} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid because the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6). There's also an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nThe snake positions are given: head at (4,3), then body segments: (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3). That's 8 segments. Let me list them in order:\n\n- Head: (4,3)\n\n- Segment 1: (4,4)\n\n- Segment 2: (4,5)\n\n- Segment 3: (3,5)\n\n- Segment 4: (2,5)\n\n- Segment 5: (2,4)\n\n- Segment 6: (3,4)\n\n- Segment 7: (3,3)  // This is the tail, I think.\n\nPositions: [(4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)]\n\nSo head is at (4,3), moving down (since direction is D). Moving down would be to (4,2), but y increases up or down? In the movement, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? Let's see the grid.\n\nTypically in grids, y=0 might be bottom or top. But here, U is (x,y+1), which is up, so y+1 is north, meaning y increases upwards. D is (x,y-1), down, y decreases. And walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is the bottom row, y=7 is the top row? No.\n\nCells occupied by walls: border cells x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. So x from 0 to 7, but playable area is x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6? Let's see.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 are playable. Similarly y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6 are playable. So the grid is 6x6 from (1,1) to (6,6).\n\n(1,1) is bottom-left? Or top-left? Since U is (x,y+1), that means y+1 is up, so if y=1 is the bottom row, y=6 is top row. For example, moving up from (x,y) to (x,y+1), which should be higher y, so y increases upwards. So (1,1) is bottom-left, (1,6) top-left, (6,1) bottom-right, (6,6) top-right.\n\nIn coordinates, (x,y), x horizontal, y vertical.\n\nHead at (4,3). Moving down, which is (x,y-1), so to (4,2).\n\nBut (4,2) is within bounds? y=2, since y from 1 to 6, yes.\n\nCurrent head direction is D, down.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (3,1) with value 1, life span 3\n\n- (2,6) with value 1, life span 5\n\n- (4,1) with value 1, life span 8\n\nAll are positive food, since value 1, and it says value1, etc., but in the input it's \"value1\" for all, so +1 each.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize survival.\n\nFirst, let's map the current state.\n\nGrid: 6x6, walls at borders and obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- Head: (4,3) - direction D\n\n- Body: (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)\n\nTail is (3,3).\n\nNow, possible moves: since head is moving down, current direction D.\n\nCannot move opposite, so cannot move up (U) because opposite of down is up.\n\nSo possible moves: D (continue down), L (left), R (right). Not U.\n\nNow, let's see the positions around head.\n\nHead at (4,3):\n\n- Down: (4,2)\n\n- Left: (3,3)\n\n- Right: (5,3)\n\n- Up: (4,4) but cannot go up because it's opposite direction, and also (4,4) is a body segment.\n\n(4,4) is occupied by the body, so even if I could go up, it's blocked.\n\nNow, check cells:\n\n- (4,2): is this free? Let's see if it's occupied.\n\nSnake positions: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)\n\nSo (4,2) is not in the list, so it should be free, unless wall or obstacle.\n\nWalls: border walls, but (4,2) has x=4, y=2, between 1 and 6, so not border. Obstacle at (4,6), not (4,2). So (4,2) is free.\n\n- Left: (3,3) - this is the tail, (3,3) is in positions, but it's the tail. Since the tail will move when the head moves, I can move to the tail position if it's safe.\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving to (3,3) might be safe if the tail moves away.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3) is the current tail.\n\n- Right: (5,3) - not in snake positions, not wall, so free.\n\n- Up: (4,4) is body, and also cannot move opposite direction, so invalid.\n\nSo possible actions: D, L, R.\n\nNow, food locations:\n\n- (3,1): value +1, life span 3. At turn t=33, so disappears after 3 turns, meaning on turn 36 it might be gone? Life span decreases every turn including current.\n\nLife span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nSo at turn t, food with life span L will disappear after L turns, so it exists for turns t to t+L-1? Let's think.\n\nIf life span is N at turn t, it decreases each turn, so at turn t, life span N, after one turn it becomes N-1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nSo it exists as long as life span > 0.\n\nAt turn t, if life span is N, it will be present for N more turns, including turn t, so it disappears at turn t + N.\n\nFor example, food at (3,1) life span 3 at turn 33, so it will be there on turn 33, 34, 35, and disappear on turn 36.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) life span 5, at turn 33, present turns 33 to 37, disappear turn 38.\n\n(4,1) life span 8, present turns 33 to 40, disappear turn 41.\n\nNow, I need to think about eating food.\n\nAlso, special case: if food is under body, it can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves on it.\n\nCurrently, are any food under snake? Let's see food positions: (3,1), (2,6), (4,1)\n\nSnake positions: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)\n\nNone of the food are at these positions, so all are on free cells.\n\n(3,1) is at y=1, x=3, snake at y=3 to 5, so not under.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nNow, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (3,3). Head is at (4,3), so adjacent? Positions: head (4,3), tail (3,3), so they are adjacent horizontally.\n\nAdjacent means sharing an edge, so left/right/up/down.\n\nSo head (4,3) and tail (3,3) are adjacent.\n\nIf I move left to (3,3), which is the tail, and if that cell has food, but (3,3) does not have food, it's part of the snake.\n\nThe food is not on tail currently.\n\nBut if I move to tail, and it has food, but here no food on tail.\n\nThe tail cell might have food, but in this case, (3,3) is occupied by tail, not food.\n\nSo moving to (3,3) might be safe since tail will move, but only if no food there or if there is food, it could be dangerous if I eat it.\n\nRule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nBut in this case, the tail cell is (3,3), which has no food, so if I move to it, I just move to where tail was, and tail moves, so no growth, no collision.\n\nSince no food eaten, length unchanged.\n\nIf there was food there, eating it would grow, so tail doesn't move away, and head collides with new tail.\n\nBut here, no food at (3,3).\n\nSo moving to (3,3) should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, other moves.\n\nNow, let's plan for multiple turns.\n\nFirst, I need to maximize score, so eat positive food when possible, but avoid risks.\n\nAlso, think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nCurrent turn t=33.\n\nPossible actions now: D, L, R.\n\nLet's evaluate each.\n\nOption 1: Move Down to (4,2)\n\nThen head to (4,2), body follows: new positions: head (4,2), then previous head (4,3) becomes body, so snake: [(4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)] and tail (3,3) is gone? When head moves, tail moves only if no food eaten.\n\nSince no food at (4,2), I just move, tail is removed, so new tail is the last segment, which was (3,4)? Positions: after move, head to new position, all segments shift.\n\nCurrent snake: positions list: index 0: head (4,3), 1: (4,4), 2: (4,5), 3: (3,5), 4: (2,5), 5: (2,4), 6: (3,4), 7: (3,3) tail.\n\nAfter moving down to (4,2): new head (4,2), then the body segments are the old positions except tail is removed since no growth.\n\nSo new positions: [(4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)] and tail is (3,4)? Index: new head at (4,2), then segment 1: old head (4,3), segment 2: old seg1 (4,4), ..., up to old seg6 (3,4), and old tail (3,3) is not included, so now 8 segments? Original 8 segments, move without eating, so length same, tail removed.\n\nOriginal positions: 8 segments. After move, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous one, so the last segment (tail) is removed.\n\nSo new snake: head at (4,2), then (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) — that's 8 positions? Let's count: 1. (4,2), 2. (4,3), 3. (4,4), 4. (4,5), 5. (3,5), 6. (2,5), 7. (2,4), 8. (3,4). But (3,4) was previously segment 6, now it's the tail? Original segments: 0:(4,3), 1:(4,4), 2:(4,5), 3:(3,5), 4:(2,5), 5:(2,4), 6:(3,4), 7:(3,3)\n\nAfter move down: new head at (4,2), which is new position. Then segment 1 is old head (4,3), segment 2 is old seg1 (4,4), segment 3 is old seg2 (4,5), segment 4 is old seg3 (3,5), segment 5 is old seg4 (2,5), segment 6 is old seg5 (2,4), segment 7 is old seg6 (3,4), and old seg7 (3,3) is not included, so tail is now (3,4). Positions: [(4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)] so 8 segments, tail at (3,4).\n\nLength unchanged.\n\nNow, from (4,2), possible moves: since moved down, direction D, so can go D, L, R, not U.\n\nDown to (4,1) — (4,1) has food! Value 1, life span 8.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, back to current turn.\n\nOption 2: Move Left to (3,3)\n\nHead to (3,3), which is the current tail.\n\nSince no food there, just move, tail moves away.\n\nNew positions: head (3,3), then old head (4,3), then (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) — old tail (3,3) is now head, so removed? Similar to above.\n\nNew head (3,3), segment 1: old head (4,3), segment 2: old seg1 (4,4), ..., segment 7: old seg6 (3,4), and old seg7 (3,3) not included, so tail is (3,4).\n\nPositions: [(3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)] tail at (3,4).\n\n(3,4) is now tail.\n\nFrom (3,3), direction: moved left, so new direction L.\n\nOption 3: Move Right to (5,3)\n\nHead to (5,3), new positions: [(5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)] tail at (3,4)? Similar.\n\nNew head (5,3), segment 1: (4,3), 2: (4,4), 3: (4,5), 4: (3,5), 5: (2,5), 6: (2,4), 7: (3,4), tail (3,4).\n\nOld segments included up to old seg6, which is (3,4), so tail is (3,4).\n\nDirection: moved right, so R.\n\nNow, food: (3,1), (2,6), (4,1)\n\n(4,1) is directly below (4,2), at (4,1).\n\n(3,1) is at (3,1), which is left and down from current head.\n\n(2,6) is at (2,6), which is up and left, but y=6 is top row.\n\nAlso, obstacle at (4,6), which is wall, cannot go there.\n\nNow, I need to think about getting to food while avoiding dead ends.\n\nSince I need to think 5 turns ahead, let's consider paths to food.\n\nFirst, the food at (3,1) has short life, only 3 turns left, so it might disappear soon. At turn 33, life span 3, so after turn 35, gone on 36.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) life 5, gone after turn 37.\n\n(4,1) life 8, plenty of time.\n\nBut (4,1) is close to head, at (4,1), head at (4,3), so two moves down: to (4,2) then (4,1).\n\nBut (4,2) is empty now, so if I go down to (4,2) on turn 33, then on turn 34 I can go down to (4,1) and eat food.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) is at (3,1), from head (4,3), I can go left to (3,3), then down to (3,2), then to (3,1), but (3,2) might be free or not.\n\nCurrent positions: (3,2) is not occupied, no wall, so free.\n\nBut from (4,3), if I go left to (3,3) on turn 33, then on turn 34 I can go down to (3,2), then turn 35 to (3,1) to eat.\n\nBut life span of (3,1) is 3 at turn 33, so on turn 35, it should be there if I eat on turn 35.\n\nLife span: at turn 33, life span 3, so present turn 33,34,35, gone turn 36.\n\nSo eating on turn 35 is possible.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) is at (2,6), which is top-left, head at (4,3), so need to go left and up.\n\nBut there is body and walls.\n\nFirst, let's consider the options for turn 33.\n\nAlso, need to avoid collisions.\n\nFor example, if I go down to (4,2), that seems safe.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (4,1) to eat on turn 34.\n\nBut is (4,1) safe to eat? No immediate danger, but after eating, snake grows.\n\nSimilarly, if I go left to (3,3), also safe.\n\nIf I go right to (5,3), (5,3) is free, no issue.\n\nBut going right might lead away from food.\n\nNow, (2,6) is at (2,6), but y=6 is top row, and there's an obstacle at (4,6), which is on the same row? (4,6) is internal obstacle.\n\nAlso, snake has segments at (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), etc.\n\n(2,6) is above (2,5), which is a body segment.\n\n(2,5) is occupied, but (2,6) might be accessible if I go up.\n\nBut let's not rush.\n\nSince (3,1) has short life, I might want to get it before it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) is easy to get.\n\n(2,6) is farther.\n\nBut let's think about the grid and possible traps.\n\nCurrent snake occupies a lot of space.\n\nList all occupied cells: from positions: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)\n\nSo the snake is coiled around.\n\nAvailable cells: for example, bottom row: y=1, cells (1,1) to (6,1), but (3,1) and (4,1) have food.\n\n(3,1) and (4,1) are both at y=1.\n\nTop row y=6: (1,6) to (6,6), but (2,6) has food, and (4,6) is obstacle, so (4,6) is wall.\n\nAlso, (3,6), (5,6), etc. might be free.\n\nBut let's see free cells.\n\nSince I need to survive, I should avoid boxing myself in.\n\nFor turn 33, if I go down to (4,2), then on turn 34 I can eat (4,1) by going down to (4,1).\n\nThen snake grows, so after eating, new head at (4,1), body: old head (4,2) becomes new segment, and tail not removed, so length increases by one.\n\nPositions after eating (4,1): head (4,1), then previous head (4,2), then the rest, and tail is old tail, which was (3,4) before? Let's simulate.\n\nAt turn 33, if I go to (4,2), no eat, positions as before: [(4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)] tail (3,4)\n\n(3,4) is tail.\n\nThen turn 34, go down to (4,1), which has food, so eat, grow.\n\nNew head (4,1), then new segment at previous head position (4,2), then the rest: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), and tail (3,4) remains, so positions: [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)] and tail is (3,4)? No, (3,4) is now the second last? Let's index.\n\nNew head: (4,1)\n\nSegment 1: old head (4,2)\n\nSegment 2: old seg1 (4,3)  // which was (4,3) in new list\n\nBetter to list: after move to (4,1) with eat:\n\n- Head: (4,1)\n\n- New body segment: the position where head was, (4,2)\n\n- Then the previous body segments: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)\n\nAnd since growth, tail is not removed, so all previous segments plus new head and new body segment? No.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat, the head moves to food, and a new segment is added at the tail position or something? No.\n\nWhen head moves to a cell with food, it eats, so head is at food cell, and the body grows, meaning the tail does not move, so the new tail is the old tail, and a new segment is added where the head was.\n\nPositions: after moving head to food, the new position list is: [new_head] + previous positions.\n\nSo length increases by one.\n\nPrevious positions before move: at turn 33 after move down: snake at [(4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)] 8 segments.\n\nMove to (4,1) with eat, so new positions: head (4,1), then (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) — 9 segments, tail at (3,4).\n\n(3,4) is tail.\n\nThen from (4,1), direction down, so can go L, R, D? D would be to (4,0), but y=0 is wall, so cannot go down. y=0 is bottom wall.\n\nSo from (4,1), possible moves: left to (3,1), right to (5,1), up to (4,2) but (4,2) is body, occupied.\n\n(4,2) is occupied by body, so cannot go up.\n\nAlso, cannot go down to wall.\n\nSo only left to (3,1) or right to (5,1).\n\n(3,1) has food, but let's see.\n\nIf I eat at (4,1) on turn 34, then on turn 35 I can go left to (3,1) to eat another food.\n\n(3,1) has life span 3 at turn 33, so on turn 35, life span should be 1? Turn 33: life span 3, after turn 33, at turn 34, life span 2, turn 35 life span 1, turn 36 gone.\n\nSo on turn 35, (3,1) is still there.\n\nSo if I go to (4,1) on turn 34, then turn 35 go left to (3,1) to eat.\n\nBut (3,1) is adjacent to head at (4,1), so I can go directly.\n\nAfter eating at (4,1), head at (4,1), then to (3,1), which has food.\n\nBut is it safe? (3,1) is free, no body there.\n\nThen snake grows more.\n\nBut then after eating (3,1), head at (3,1), and body includes (4,1), (4,2), etc.\n\nFrom (3,1), possible moves: up to (3,2), right to (4,1) but occupied, left to (2,1), down to (3,0) wall.\n\nSo only up or left.\n\nBut (4,1) occupied, so right not possible, only up to (3,2) or left to (2,1).\n\n(3,2) should be free.\n\nBut let's see the bigger picture.\n\nIf I don't go down now, I might miss (3,1) if life is short.\n\nBack to turn 33 choices.\n\nIf I go left to (3,3) on turn 33.\n\nThen positions: head (3,3), body: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) tail (3,4)\n\nFrom (3,3), direction left (since moved left), so can go L, U, D? Not R, opposite.\n\nL: (2,3), U: (3,4) but (3,4) is body, occupied, D: (3,2)\n\nSo possible: L to (2,3) or D to (3,2)\n\n(2,3) is free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\n(3,2) free.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (3,1) for food.\n\nFor example, turn 33 go left to (3,3)\n\nTurn 34 go down to (3,2)\n\nTurn 35 go down to (3,1) to eat.\n\n(3,1) life span: at turn 35, it should be present, as above.\n\nSimilarly, if I go right to (5,3) on turn 33, then I'm moving away from the bottom food, and (3,1) might disappear before I reach it.\n\n(3,1) is only reachable in 2 moves from head, but from (5,3), it's farther.\n\nFrom (5,3) to (3,1) is at least |5-3| + |3-1| = 2+2=4 moves, but with body, might not be direct.\n\nBut turn 33 to 35 is only 2 turns, so on turn 35 I can be at (3,1) only if I start moving towards it now.\n\nFrom current position, to (3,1): min moves 2: e.g., left to (3,3) then down to (3,2) then (3,1) on turn 35.\n\nOr down to (4,2) then left to (3,2) then (3,1), but (3,2) might be same.\n\nBut if I go right to (5,3), then on turn 34 I can go left to (4,3) but (4,3) is body? After move to (5,3), positions: head (5,3), body (4,3), (4,4), etc.\n\n(4,3) is body segment.\n\nFrom (5,3), possible moves: since direction R, can go R, U, D, not L.\n\nR to (6,3), U to (5,4), D to (5,2)\n\nThen to reach (3,1), it would take more moves, like turn 34 go left? But cannot, opposite direction. Or go down to (5,2), then left to (4,2), then down to (4,1) or left to (3,2), etc., but (3,1) might be gone by turn 35 or 36.\n\nTurn 33 at (5,3), turn 34 say to (5,2), turn 35 to (4,2) or (5,1), then to (3,1) on turn 36 at earliest, but (3,1) gone on turn 36, so might miss it.\n\nTurn 36 it disappears, so on turn 35 it is there, turn 36 gone.\n\nIf on turn 35 I can reach it, ok.\n\nFrom (5,3) on turn 33, turn 34 go down to (5,2), then turn 35 go left to (4,2), but (4,2) might not have food, then to (3,2) on turn 36, but (3,1) gone, so cannot eat on turn 35 if I go right.\n\nFrom (5,2) on turn 34, I can go directly to (3,2) but not adjacent, must move one step.\n\nFrom (5,2) to (3,2) is not adjacent, distance 2 in x, so need two moves: e.g., left to (4,2) then left to (3,2).\n\nThen on turn 36 to (3,1), but (3,1) gone.\n\nSo indeed, if I go right on turn 33, I cannot reach (3,1) before it disappears.\n\nTherefore, to get (3,1), I need to move towards it now, either left or down.\n\nIf I go down to (4,2) on turn 33, then on turn 34 I can go to (4,1) to eat, or to (3,2) then (3,1) on turn 35.\n\nBut (4,1) is also food, so I might eat (4,1) first.\n\nSimilarly, if I go left to (3,3), then I can go down to (3,2) on turn 34, then (3,1) on turn 35.\n\nNow, (4,1) has longer life, so I can get it later.\n\nBut let's see the risk.\n\nAlso, there is (2,6) to consider.\n\nFirst, let's compare going down or left on turn 33.\n\nOption A: Turn 33 down to (4,2)\n\nThen turn 34, from (4,2), direction D, can go L to (3,2), R to (5,2), D to (4,1) which has food.\n\nIf I go D to (4,1) and eat, as before, then head at (4,1), and I can go to (3,1) on turn 35.\n\nBut from (4,1), after eating, as I thought earlier, only left or right possible, since up is body, down wall.\n\nLeft to (3,1) or right to (5,1).\n\n(3,1) has food, so I can go left to (3,1) on turn 35 to eat again.\n\nThen after that, head at (3,1), and I need to move, only up to (3,2) or left to (2,1), assuming (2,1) free.\n\nBut snake body is around, might have space issues.\n\nAfter eating (4,1) on turn 34, positions: head (4,1), body: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) 9 segments.\n\nThen turn 35 go left to (3,1) and eat, so grow again: head (3,1), then (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) 10 segments, tail (3,4).\n\nThen from (3,1), possible moves: up to (3,2), left to (2,1), or down to wall, right to (4,1) occupied.\n\nSo only up or left.\n\n(3,2) should be free, (2,1) free.\n\nIf I go up to (3,2), then I can continue.\n\nBut the area around (3,2) to (3,5) is occupied, but (3,2) might be free.\n\nCurrent occupied: after turn 35, positions include (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)\n\nSo (3,2) is not occupied, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) free.\n\nThen from (3,2), I can go up, etc.\n\nBut the snake is long, and the grid is small, 6x6=36 cells, snake 10 segments, so 26 free, but with walls, playable cells 36 - walls? Grid 1-6 x 1-6, 36 cells, walls are borders but not inside, except obstacle at (4,6), so 36 - 1 = 35 cells, snake 10, so 25 free, but I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nNow, if on turn 33 I go left to (3,3) instead.\n\nTurn 33 left to (3,3), positions: [(3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)] tail (3,4)\n\n(3,4) is tail.\n\nThen turn 34, from (3,3), direction L, can go L to (2,3), D to (3,2), not U (to (3,4) occupied) or R.\n\n(2,3) and (3,2) both free.\n\nIf I go down to (3,2), then turn 35 down to (3,1) to eat.\n\nAfter eating (3,1) on turn 35, head at (3,1), grow: positions head (3,1), then (3,2)? After move to (3,2) on turn 34, positions: head (3,2), body (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), tail (3,4)? Let's sequence.\n\nAfter turn 33 move left: snake at [(3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)]\n\nTurn 34 move down to (3,2): no food there, so just move, head to (3,2), body: (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), tail removed, so positions: [(3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)] tail (2,4)\n\nThen turn 35 move down to (3,1) and eat, so grow: head (3,1), then new segment at (3,2)? After move to (3,1) with eat, new positions: head (3,1), then previous head position (3,2), then the rest: (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) and since growth, tail not removed, so positions: [(3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)] 9 segments, tail (2,4)\n\nThen from (3,1), same as before, can go up to (3,2) occupied, or left to (2,1), or down wall, right to (4,1) which is free now? (4,1) has food, but let's see.\n\n(4,1) is free, has food.\n\nSo I can go right to (4,1) on turn 36 to eat.\n\nBut (4,1) life span 8, still there.\n\nSo in both cases, I can eat both (3,1) and (4,1) by around turn 35-36.\n\nBut in the first scenario, if I go down on turn 33, I eat (4,1) on 34 and (3,1) on 35.\n\nIn second, go left on 33, then to (3,2) on 34, eat (3,1) on 35, then to (4,1) on 36.\n\nNow, what about (2,6)? It has life span 5, so at turn 33, present until turn 37, so I can get it later.\n\nBut let's see if there are risks.\n\nAnother thing: the tail reward danger.\n\nCurrently, when I move, the tail is moving.\n\nIn the first option, if I go down to (4,2) on turn 33, tail is at (3,4).\n\nThen on turn 34, if I go to (4,1), tail moves to (2,4) or something.\n\nBut no food on tail, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, also, the food at (2,6) is at top, and there's an obstacle at (4,6).\n\nTo get to (2,6), from current position, I need to go left and up.\n\nBut the snake has body at (2,5), (3,5), etc., so (2,6) is adjacent to (2,5), which is body.\n\nBut (2,6) is free, so I can move to it if head is adjacent.\n\nBut from head at (4,3), to (2,6) is not close.\n\nPath: for example, go left to (3,3), then up? But (3,4) is body, occupied.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can go to (2,3) or (3,2), not up.\n\nThen to (2,3), then to (2,4) but (2,4) is body, occupied.\n\n(2,4) is occupied.\n\nFrom (2,3), I can go up to (2,4)? Occupied, or left to (1,3), or down to (2,2), etc.\n\nIt might be tricky to reach (2,6) because of the body.\n\nFor example, to reach (2,6), I need to have head at (2,5), (1,6), (2,7) invalid, (3,6) but (3,6) might be free, but (2,6) adjacent to (2,5), which is body.\n\n(2,5) is a body segment, so to eat (2,6), I need to move to (2,6) when (2,5) has moved away.\n\nCurrently, (2,5) is occupied, so I need to wait until the snake moves so that (2,5) is vacated.\n\nSimilarly, the body needs to move.\n\nFor instance, if I move the snake, the tail moves, so positions change.\n\nBut (2,5) is not the tail; tail is at (3,3) or something.\n\nIn current state, (2,5) is a body segment, not tail.\n\nAs the snake moves, (2,5) will be vacated when the segment moves.\n\nFor example, if I move down, (2,5) might stay or move depending.\n\nBut to eat (2,6), I need to move head to (2,6) when it is not occupied and (2,5) is not there or something, but since (2,6) is adjacent to (2,5), if I move to (2,6) while (2,5) is still there, it might be possible if the body moves.\n\nThe rule: food can be under body only if body moves away and head moves on, but here (2,6) is not under body, it's free.\n\n(2,6) is free, so I can move to it if adjacent.\n\nBut if I move to (2,6) while (2,5) is adjacent, it might not be a problem, unless the tail is involved.\n\nTail reward danger only if head adjacent to tail and tail has food.\n\nHere, (2,5) is not tail, it's body, so moving to (2,6) should be fine, as long as no collision.\n\nBut (2,6) is adjacent to (2,5), which is body, so if I move head to (2,6), it would touch the body at (2,5), so collision.\n\nIs that right?\n\nPositions: if head is at (2,6), and (2,5) is a body segment, then yes, head touches body, so collision, dead.\n\nTherefore, I cannot move to (2,6) while (2,5) is occupied by body.\n\nSimilarly, I need (2,5) to be vacated before I can eat (2,6).\n\nSo I have to wait until the snake moves so that (2,5) is no longer occupied.\n\nFor example, when the segment that was at (2,5) moves away.\n\nIn the current snake, (2,5) is segment 4 in the list, so as the snake moves, it will change position.\n\nFor instance, if I move down, the body segments shift.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nCurrent: seg0: (4,3) head, seg1: (4,4), seg2: (4,5), seg3: (3,5), seg4: (2,5), seg5: (2,4), seg6: (3,4), seg7: (3,3) tail.\n\nAfter move down to (4,2): new head (4,2), seg1: (4,3), seg2: (4,4), seg3: (4,5), seg4: (3,5), seg5: (2,5), seg6: (2,4), seg7: (3,4) tail. So (2,5) is still occupied by seg5? New seg4 is (3,5), seg5 is (2,5), so (2,5) occupied.\n\nAfter another move, it might move.\n\nTo vacate (2,5), I need the snake to move such that the segment leaves (2,5).\n\nFor example, when the head moves and the body follows, (2,5) will be occupied until the segment moves to a new position.\n\nSince the snake moves one step at a time, the position (2,5) will be vacated only if the segment that was there moves to another cell and no other segment comes, but in the shift, when the body moves, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, so the cell is vacated only if not occupied by the next segment, but since they move sequentially, the cell is vacated after the segment leaves and before new one comes, but in terms of grid, at each turn, the positions are updated simultaneously, I think.\n\nIn snake, when head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the old tail cell is vacated.\n\nFor a specific cell like (2,5), it is occupied as long as there is a segment there, and when that segment moves to a new position, (2,5) is vacated.\n\nIn this case, seg4 is at (2,5) in current state.\n\nAfter a move, if the head moves, seg4 will move to where seg3 was, which is (3,5) or something, depending on the move.\n\nFor example, if I move down, as above, after move, seg5 is at (2,5), so (2,5) still occupied.\n\nIf I move in a way that the body shifts differently.\n\nBut to vacate (2,5), I need to move so that the segment that is at (2,5) moves away and no other segment comes to (2,5) immediately.\n\nSince the segments are connected, when the snake moves, the position (2,5) might be left empty if the segment moves and the next segment doesn't come to it, but in the chain, it's possible.\n\nFor instance, if I move the head in a direction that causes the body to turn.\n\nBut it might take a few turns.\n\nFor example, current seg4 at (2,5). If I move the head, seg4 will move to where seg3 is, which is (3,5), so (2,5) vacated, and seg5 moves to where seg4 was, (2,5)? No.\n\nAfter head move, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n\nSo for seg4, it moves to the position that seg3 had before the move.\n\nSimilarly, seg5 moves to where seg4 was, etc.\n\nBefore move, seg3 at (3,5), seg4 at (2,5).\n\nAfter head move, seg4 moves to position of old seg3, which is (3,5).\n\nThen seg5 moves to position of old seg4, which is (2,5).\n\nSo (2,5) is now occupied by seg5, so it never vacates; it's always occupied by some segment until the tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, since seg5 moves to (2,5) after seg4 leaves, (2,5) is always occupied as long as the snake is there.\n\nIs that true?\n\nOld positions: seg3: (3,5), seg4: (2,5)\n\nAfter move: seg4 moves to old seg3 position (3,5)\n\nseg5 moves to old seg4 position (2,5)\n\nSo yes, (2,5) is now occupied by seg5.\n\nSimilarly, if the snake moves, (2,5) will be occupied by different segments, but the cell (2,5) is occupied until the segment that is there moves and no one takes its place, which only happens when the tail leaves a cell.\n\nSpecifically, (2,5) will be vacated when the segment that is at (2,5) is the tail, and the tail moves.\n\nOtherwise, if it's a body segment, when it moves, the next segment moves in.\n\nSo for (2,5) to be free, it needs to be the tail position and the tail moves away.\n\nCurrently, (2,5) is not tail; tail is (3,3).\n\nThe tail is at (3,3), so (2,5) is body.\n\n(2,5) will be vacated only when it becomes the tail and the tail moves.\n\nBut as the snake moves, the tail changes.\n\nFor example, after a move without eating, the tail moves to the previous position of the second last segment or something, but the cell is vacated.\n\nIn general, for a cell to be vacated, it must be the tail position at some point, and then the tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, (2,5) is currently not tail, so I need to wait until the snake moves enough that (2,5) becomes the tail, then when tail moves, it vacates.\n\nBut that might take many turns, and (2,6) has life span 5, so it might disappear before.\n\nFor example, current tail at (3,3). The segment at (2,5) is seg4, so it will become tail after 4 moves or something, but not necessarily, because the snake is turning.\n\nIt's messy.\n\nPerhaps it's not worth going for (2,6) because of the difficulty and short life.\n\nLife span 5, turn 33 to 37.\n\nIf I focus on the bottom food, I can eat (3,1) and (4,1) easily.\n\nThen (2,6) might be too risky to get in time.\n\nMoreover, there's an obstacle at (4,6), so the top row is partially blocked.\n\nSo for long-term survival, I should go for the safe food now.\n\nTherefore, for turn 33, I should move towards the bottom food.\n\nNow, between down and left.\n\nIf I go down to (4,2), I can eat (4,1) next turn.\n\nIf I go left to (3,3), I can go to (3,1) in two turns.\n\nBut (4,1) has longer life, so I can get it later, but (3,1) is urgent.\n\nAlso, by going down, I eat (4,1) on turn 34, then (3,1) on turn 35.\n\nBy going left, I eat (3,1) on turn 35, then (4,1) on turn 36.\n\nBut in both cases, I eat both.\n\nNow, after eating, in the down case, when I eat (4,1) on turn 34, I am at (4,1), which is corner, and I have to go left or right.\n\nIf I go left to (3,1) on turn 35, I eat and am at (3,1), another corner.\n\nThen from (3,1), I can go up to (3,2) or left to (2,1).\n\n(3,2) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, in the left case, after eating (3,1) on turn 35, I am at (3,1), and I can go to (4,1) on turn 36.\n\nBut at (3,1) after eating (3,1), I can go to (4,1) if possible.\n\nBut from (3,1), after eating on turn 35, positions as before, I can go right to (4,1) since (4,1) is free and has food.\n\nThen eat (4,1) on turn 36.\n\nNow, let's see the space.\n\nPerhaps going down on turn 33 is slightly better because I eat (4,1) earlier, and it has higher life, but since all are +1, same value, but I get the score earlier, but for survival, same.\n\nBut in the down move, when I go to (4,2) on turn 33, then to (4,1) on turn 34, I eat and grow, then to (3,1) on turn 35, eat and grow again.\n\nThen on turn 35, head at (3,1), with long snake.\n\nThen I need to move, say to (3,2) or (2,1).\n\n(3,2) is free, so go up to (3,2).\n\nThen from there, I can explore.\n\nIf I go left on turn 33, I go to (3,3), then to (3,2) on turn 34, then to (3,1) on turn 35 to eat, then to (4,1) on turn 36 to eat.\n\nBut on turn 36, (4,1) is still there.\n\nThen head at (4,1), same as before.\n\nBut in this case, on turn 34, when I am at (3,2), the cell (3,2) might be occupied in the other path, but not.\n\nAnother difference: in the down path, when I eat (4,1) on turn 34, the tail is at (3,4), and after growing, it stays.\n\nThen when I go to (3,1) on turn 35, tail still there.\n\nIn the left path, on turn 34, at (3,2), tail is at (2,4), etc.\n\nBut no big difference.\n\nHowever, there is a risk with the tail or something.\n\nNotice that in the current state, if I go down to (4,2), then to (4,1), I might be trapping myself if I'm not careful, but from (4,1), I can go left to (3,1), which is fine.\n\nThen from (3,1), I can go to (3,2).\n\n(3,2) is free, and from there, I can go up to (3,3), but (3,3) might be occupied or not.\n\nAfter turn 35 in down path: after eating (3,1), head at (3,1), body: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) so (3,3) is not occupied? Positions: (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) so (3,2) and (3,3) are free? (3,2) not listed, (3,3) not listed, so free.\n\n(3,3) is free, so from (3,1) I can go up to (3,2), then to (3,3), etc.\n\nSimilarly, in left path.\n\nSo both seem fine.\n\nBut let's consider the direction for future moves.\n\nAlso, the food at (2,6) is there, but I may not get it.\n\nFor turn 33, I think moving down is good to get (4,1) quickly.\n\nThen I can think about (2,6) later if possible.\n\nBut life span 5, by turn 38, so if I eat on turn 37 or before.\n\nAfter eating the bottom food, I can move up.\n\nFor example, from (3,1) after eating both, go to (3,2), then to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut (3,3) might be free.\n\nThen to (3,4) but (3,4) is body, but after moves, it might be different.\n\nIn the positions after turn 35, (3,4) is occupied, so from (3,2), I can go to (3,3) which is free, then to (2,3) or (4,3), but (4,3) occupied.\n\n(4,3) is body.\n\nSo to (2,3) or up to (3,4) occupied, so only to (2,3) or down to (3,1) occupied.\n\nFrom (3,2), after arriving, direction, etc.\n\nBut it might be tight, but possible.\n\nTo avoid risk, moving down on turn 33 might be better because I get one food earlier, and I'm closer to the center or something.\n\nAnother thing: the head direction.\n\nCurrent direction D, if I go down, I continue down, which is fine.\n\nIf I go left, I change to left.\n\nBut not important.\n\nI think for turn 33, I'll go down to (4,2).\n\nThen turn 34 down to (4,1) to eat.\n\nThen turn 35 left to (3,1) to eat.\n\nThen turn 36, from (3,1), go up to (3,2).\n\nThen turn 37 from (3,2), I can go to (3,3) or to (2,2), etc.\n\nBut I need to specify 5 turns ahead.\n\nThe answer should be for turns t=33 to t=37 or something, but the format is to output actions for several turns.\n\nIt says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the answer format is to list actions for multiple turns, starting from current turn.\n\n\"Answer Format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nAnd it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should plan for at least 5 turns.\n\nCurrent turn t=33, so plan turns 33 to 38 or so.\n\nBut I need to output the actions.\n\nFirst, for turn 33, action.\n\nI think D is good.\n\nThen turn 34, from (4,2), go D to (4,1) to eat.\n\nThen turn 35, from (4,1), go L to (3,1) to eat.\n\nThen turn 36, from (3,1), go U to (3,2).\n\nNow, from (3,2), what can I do.\n\nPosition at turn 36: after turn 35, head at (3,1) after eating (3,1), so positions: head (3,1), body: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) tail (3,4)\n\nThen turn 36 move U to (3,2): no food, so just move, head to (3,2), body: (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) and tail (2,4) removed? No, move without eat, so tail removed.\n\nNew positions: head (3,2), then (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) and tail (2,5)? Segments: new head (3,2), seg1: old head (3,1), seg2: old seg1 (4,1), ..., up to old seg8 (2,5), and old tail (3,4) not included, so tail is (2,5).\n\nPositions: [(3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)] 9 segments, tail (2,5).\n\nFrom (3,2), direction U (since moved up), so can go U, L, R? Not D opposite.\n\nU to (3,3), L to (2,2), R to (4,2) but (4,2) is body, occupied.\n\n(3,3) is free? Not in positions, so free.\n\n(2,2) free.\n\nSo can go U to (3,3) or L to (2,2).\n\nIf go U to (3,3), then from there, etc.\n\nNow, (2,6) is still there, life span 5 at turn 33, so at turn 36, life span 2 (since 33:5, 34:4, 35:3, 36:2), so present.\n\nBut to reach (2,6), from (3,2) or (3,3), I need to go to (2,3), (2,4) but (2,4) occupied, etc.\n\n(2,4) is occupied in current positions, but after moves, it might change.\n\nAt turn 36, (2,4) is occupied by body, as above.\n\n(2,5) is tail, but occupied.\n\nTo get to (2,6), I need (2,5) free or something, but (2,5) is occupied, and (2,6) adjacent, so I cannot move to (2,6) because (2,5) is body.\n\nUnless (2,5) is the tail and I move the tail away.\n\nBut (2,5) is tail at turn 36 positions.\n\nFrom (3,2) on turn 36, if I go L to (2,2), for example.\n\nThen head to (2,2), positions: head (2,2), body (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), tail (2,5)? After move to (2,2), no eat, so new positions: head (2,2), seg1: (3,2), seg2: (3,1), seg3: (4,1), seg4: (4,2), seg5: (4,3), seg6: (4,4), seg7: (4,5), seg8: (3,5), tail (2,5) removed? Old positions had tail (2,5), so after move, tail removed, so new tail is (3,5).\n\nPositions: [(2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)] tail (3,5).\n\n(2,5) is vacated.\n\nThen from (2,2), I can go to (2,3) or (1,2) or (2,1), etc.\n\n(2,6) is above, but (2,5) is now free, so I can go to (2,3) then (2,4), but (2,4) might be free now.\n\nAt turn 36, (2,4) was occupied, but after move to (2,2) on turn 36, (2,4) is not in positions, so free.\n\nThen on turn 37, from (2,2), I can go up to (2,3), then to (2,4) on turn 38, but (2,6) life span at turn 36 is 2, so turn 37:1, turn 38:0, gone, so on turn 38 it disappears, so I can eat on turn 37 if I reach.\n\nFrom (2,2) on turn 36, I can go up to (2,3) on turn 37, then to (2,4) on turn 38, but (2,6) is at (2,6), not (2,4).\n\nTo reach (2,6), from (2,3) go to (2,4), then to (2,5), then to (2,6).\n\nBut on turn 37, from (2,2) to (2,3), then turn 38 to (2,4), turn 39 to (2,5), turn 40 to (2,6), but (2,6) gone by turn 38, so too late.\n\nIf from (2,2) on turn 36, I go directly to (2,6)? Not adjacent.\n\nMinimum from (2,2) to (2,6) is 4 moves up, but y from 2 to 6, difference 4, so at least 4 moves: (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6).\n\nTurn 36 at (2,2), turn 37 (2,3), turn 38 (2,4), turn 39 (2,5), turn 40 (2,6), but (2,6) life ends turn 38, so not possible.\n\nTherefore, I cannot reach (2,6) in time; it will disappear before I can eat it.\n\nSo it's not feasible to get (2,6), so I should ignore it and focus on survival.\n\nFor the plan, I'll go with moving down to get the bottom food.\n\nSo for turn 33: D\n\nThen turn 34: D to (4,1) eat\n\nThen turn 35: L to (3,1) eat\n\nThen turn 36: U to (3,2)\n\nThen turn 37: from (3,2), I need to choose.\n\nPossible U to (3,3) or L to (2,2)\n\n(3,3) is free, as before.\n\n(2,2) free.\n\nTo avoid corners, go to (3,3) first.\n\nThen from (3,3), I can go to (2,3) or (3,4), etc.\n\nBut (3,4) might be occupied or not.\n\nAt turn 36, after moving U to (3,2), positions as above: [(3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)] tail (2,5)\n\nThen turn 37, from (3,2), if I go U to (3,3), no food, so move: head to (3,3), body: (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), tail (2,5) removed, so new tail (3,5)\n\nPositions: [(3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)] tail (3,5)\n\nFrom (3,3), direction U, can go U, L, R? Not D.\n\nU to (3,4), but (3,4) not in positions, but is it free? Previously (3,4) was occupied, but now it might be free.\n\nIn current positions, (3,4) not listed, so free? But (3,4) was tail earlier, but now not occupied.\n\n(3,4) is not in the list, so free.\n\nU to (3,4) or L to (2,3) or R to (4,3) but (4,3) occupied.\n\n(4,3) is occupied.\n\nSo U to (3,4) or L to (2,3).\n\n(3,4) is free, so can go there.\n\nThen continue.\n\nFor the answer, I need to output actions for several turns.\n\nSince the food at (2,6) is not reachable, I'll plan to eat the bottom food and then move to open space.\n\nSo for turn 33: D\n\nTurn 34: D (to eat at (4,1))\n\nTurn 35: L (to eat at (3,1))\n\nThen turn 36: U (to (3,2))\n\nFor turn 37, from (3,2) I can go U to (3,3)\n\nBut I need to specify.\n\nPerhaps output 5 turns: t33 to t37.\n\nt37 action depends.\n\nSince thinking ahead, I can define the path.\n\nTo be safe, after (3,2), go to (3,3), then to (3,4), etc.\n\nBut (3,4) might be available.\n\nSince the grid has an obstacle at (4,6), and top row, but I can go to the right.\n\nFor example, from (3,2) go U to (3,3), then U to (3,4), but (3,4) is at y=4, then to (3,5) but (3,5) is occupied, body.\n\nIn positions, (3,5) is occupied.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can go left or right or up.\n\nBut let's not overcomplicate.\n\nI think for the first few turns, it's clear.\n\nSo I'll go with:\n\nTurn 33: D\n\nTurn 34: D\n\nTurn 35: L\n\nThen for turn 36: from (3,1) after eating, go U to (3,2)\n\nFor turn 37: from (3,2), go U to (3,3)  // since (3,3) free\n\nThen for turn 38: from (3,3), go U to (3,4)  // assuming (3,4) free\n\nBut at turn 36, when at (3,2), (3,4) might be free, but after turn 37 to (3,3), then to (3,4).\n\n(3,4) should be free as per earlier calculation.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut to be precise, in the plan, I can do that.\n\nSince the answer format, I need to list actions.\n\nAlso, for the boxed answer.\n\nSo let's write.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned multiple turns ahead (5+ turns). The key considerations are:\n\n- **Food Priorities**: The food at (3,1) has a short life span (disappears after turn 35), so it must be eaten by turn 35. The food at (4,1) has a longer life span (disappears after turn 40) and is easily accessible. The food at (2,6) has a life span until turn 37, but it is difficult to reach due to body segments blocking access (e.g., (2,5) is occupied, and moving to (2,6) would cause a collision). Reaching (2,6) requires vacating (2,5), which may not happen in time, so this food is ignored to avoid unnecessary risk.\n- **Immediate Actions (Turn 33)**: The snake head is at (4,3) moving down (D). Possible moves are D (to (4,2)), L (to (3,3)), or R (to (5,3)). Moving D allows immediate progress toward (4,1) and sets up eating both (4,1) and (3,1) efficiently. Moving L also allows access to (3,1) but delays eating (4,1). Moving R moves away from the critical food and risks missing (3,1). Thus, D is optimal for turn 33.\n- **Turn 34**: From (4,2), moving D to (4,1) eats the high-value food (+1, length increases) and positions the snake to reach (3,1) next.\n- **Turn 35**: From (4,1), moving L to (3,1) eats the remaining short-life food (+1, length increases) before it disappears.\n- **Subsequent Moves (Turns 36-37)**: After eating both foods, the snake must avoid corners and seek open space. From (3,1), moving U to (3,2) escapes the bottom row. Then, from (3,2), moving U to (3,3) continues toward the center, avoiding potential traps.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: After turn 37, the snake should navigate toward open areas (e.g., right or up) to avoid collisions. The food at (2,6) is unfeasible and ignored. The plan ensures the snake survives beyond turn 38 with increased length.\n\n**Action Plan (Turns 33 to 37)**:\n- Turn 33: Move down (D) to (4,2) – positions for accessing (4,1).\n- Turn 34: Move down (D) to (4,1) – eat food (+1), length increases to 9.\n- Turn 35: Move left (L) to (3,1) – eat food (+1), length increases to 10.\n- Turn 36: Move up (U) to (3,2) – escape corner, no food.\n- Turn 37: Move up (U) to (3,3) – continue to open space, no food.\n\nThis sequence eats two positive foods, avoids all risks (no collisions or walls), and sets up for further exploration.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 33\\text{: D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 34\\text{: D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 35\\text{: L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 36\\text{: U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 37\\text{: U} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 34, and I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm the coordinates.\n\nWalls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6? No, walls occupy those cells, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Similarly, internal obstacle at (4,6). So playable cells are from (1,1) to (6,6), but (4,6) is blocked, so it's not playable.\n\nList all blocked cells: all cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (4,6). So for example, (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (1,0) to (6,0), (1,7) to (6,7), and (4,6). But since y=0 and y=7 are walls, rows y=0 and y=7 are all walls, similarly columns x=0 and x=7 are walls. So the grid has cells from (1,1) to (6,6), but with (4,6) being an internal obstacle, so (4,6) is also blocked.\n\nNow, snake positions: [(4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)]\n\nHead is at (4,2), and direction is D (down). But if head is at (4,2) and moving down, that would be to (4,1), but let's see the positions.\n\nList the snake segments in order: head is first, so index 0: (4,2), then (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4). So the tail is (3,4).\n\nNow, head direction is D, down. So from (4,2), moving down would go to (4,1).\n\nBut y=1 is within bounds, since walls are at y=0, so (4,1) should be playable, but let's check for walls or obstacles.\n\nWalls: border cells x=0,7 or y=0,7, so (4,1) has y=1, not 0, so it's not a wall cell. Internal obstacle is (4,6), not (4,1), so (4,1) should be free, but there might be food or something.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (3,1) with life span 2, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (2,6) with life span 4, value 1\n\n- (4,1) with life span 7, value 1\n\n- (5,1) with life span 10, value 1\n\nAll food is positive, value 1, so all good to eat, but I need to be careful with tail reward danger.\n\nNow, current turn is 34.\n\nI need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score and ensure survival.\n\nFirst, let's visualize the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (4,6) is blocked.\n\nSo playable cells:\n\n(1,1) (2,1) (3,1) (4,1) (5,1) (6,1)\n\n(1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (4,2) (5,2) (6,2)\n\n(1,3) (2,3) (3,3) (4,3) (5,3) (6,3)\n\n(1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) (5,4) (6,4)  -- (4,4) is part of snake\n\n(1,5) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) (5,5) (6,5)  -- (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) are snake\n\n(1,6) (2,6) (3,6) (5,6) (6,6)  -- (4,6) blocked, so no cell at (4,6)\n\ny=6 row: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), then (4,6) blocked, so (5,6), (6,6) are available.\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (4,2) - direction D\n\nBody: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), then (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)\n\nSo the snake is like: from (4,2) down to (4,3)? No: positions are listed as head first, so (4,2) -> (4,3) -> (4,4) -> (4,5) -> (3,5) -> (2,5) -> (2,4) -> (3,4)\n\nSo it's moving: from head (4,2) to (4,3) which is up? Let's see coordinates.\n\nAssume y increases up or down? Typically in grids, y=0 is top or bottom? In the movement, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so if U increases y, that means y increases upwards, so (x,1) is bottom, (x,6) is top? Let's confirm.\n\nIn the food, (3,1) is given, and walls y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom or top? Since D is (x,y-1), that means decreasing y is down, so lower y is down, higher y is up. So y=1 is the bottom row, y=6 is the top row.\n\nIn the snake positions, head is at (4,2), which is x=4, y=2. Moving down (D) would be to (4,1), y=1.\n\nSnake body: (4,2) head, then (4,3) which is one above, so the snake was moving up to (4,3), but current direction is D? Inconsistency.\n\nCurrent head direction is given as D, but the position before head is (4,3), which has same x, higher y, so if y increases up, (4,3) is above (4,2), so the snake was moving down to (4,2)? Let's think.\n\nThe snake positions list: index 0: head (4,2), index 1: (4,3), which is the segment behind the head. Since the snake moves, the head was previously at some position, and it moved to (4,2).\n\nCurrent head direction is D, meaning it is facing down, so last move was down to (4,2).\n\nBut from where? Before (4,2), it was at (4,3)? No, the positions are the current positions. So at this turn, head is at (4,2), and the body segments are (4,3), (4,4), etc.\n\nThe segment immediately behind the head is (4,3), which is at (x,y+1) relative to head? Head at (4,2), segment behind at (4,3), so if y=3 > y=2, and y increases up, then (4,3) is above (4,2), so the head is below the neck, meaning the snake is facing down. That makes sense with direction D.\n\nSimilarly, tail is at (3,4).\n\nNow, food:\n\n- (3,1): value 1, life span 2, so it will disappear after 2 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 34, life span 2, so after turn 34, it will have 1 left, after turn 35, 0, so it disappears at the start of turn 36? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Life-span disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for food at turn t with life span L, it will be present for L more turns, including turn t. So after L turns, it disappears.\n\nAt turn t, life span L, it will disappear after turn t+L-1? Let's see.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn t, countdown is L, at turn t+1, countdown L-1, ..., at turn t+L-1, countdown 1, then at turn t+L, it disappears, so it is not present on turn t+L.\n\nFor example, (3,1) at turn 34, life span 2, so countdown 2 at turn 34. After turn 34, countdown 1 at turn 35. After turn 35, countdown 0, so it disappears, not present on turn 36.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) life span 4, at turn 34, so will be present until turn 37? Turn 34: countdown 4, turn 35:3, turn 36:2, turn 37:1, turn 38:0 disappear, so last chance to eat is turn 37.\n\nLife span N, disappears after N turns, meaning after N turns from now it is gone.\n\n\"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn t, with life span N, it will disappear at the end of turn t+N-1, or start of turn t+N?\n\nTypically, \"after N turns\" might mean after N full turns.\n\nBut to be precise, let's assume that at the beginning of turn t, the food is there with countdown N. After the turn, countdown decreases to N-1 for turn t+1. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n\nStandard: \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so on turn t, when we process, countdown is L, then after the turn, it decreases to L-1 for the next state. If L=1, after decrease to 0, it disappears, so not present on next turn.\n\nFor (3,1), L=2 at turn 34. After turn 34, L=1 for turn 35. After turn 35, L=0, disappears, not present on turn 36.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) L=4, present until after turn 37? Turn 34: L=4, turn 35: L=3, turn 36: L=2, turn 37: L=1, turn 38: L=0 disappear, so not present turn 38.\n\nTurn 37: L=1, can be eaten on turn 37, then after that it disappears.\n\nNow back to snake.\n\nHead at (4,2), direction D (down). So possible moves from here: since direction is D, I can move D, L, R, but not U, because no instant reverse. Reverse of down is up, so I cannot move U immediately.\n\nPossible actions: D (down to (4,1)), L (left to (3,2)), R (right to (5,2)).\n\nNow, check if these are valid.\n\nFirst, (4,1): is it free? Snake positions: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4). None at (4,1). Walls: (4,1) is x=4,y=1, not border wall, not (4,6) obstacle, so it should be free. But there is food at (4,1), which is positive.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2): not in snake positions, not wall, no food listed, so free.\n\n(5,2): not in snake, not wall, no food, free.\n\nNow, food at (4,1) is present, so if I move down to (4,1), I eat the food, snake grows.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, there is food at (3,1) and (5,1), but (3,1) has short life span.\n\nLife spans: (3,1) L=2, so must be eaten by turn 35 or it's gone.\n\n(4,1) L=7, plenty of time.\n\n(5,1) L=10, even more.\n\n(2,6) L=4.\n\nNow, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nTail is at (3,4). Where is head? (4,2), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right.\n\n(4,2) to (3,4): difference in x=1, y=2, not adjacent; need |dx| + |dy| =1 for adjacent.\n\nSo not adjacent to tail.\n\nNow, let's think about possible paths.\n\nI need to maximize score, so eat food, but avoid risks.\n\nFirst, immediate move: I can go to (4,1), (3,2), or (5,2).\n\nIf I go to (4,1), I eat the food there, snake grows to 9 segments, and I'm at (4,1).\n\nThen from there, possible moves.\n\nBut (4,1) is bottom row, y=1.\n\nThen I can go L to (3,1), or R to (5,1), or U to (4,2), but (4,2) is the previous head, which will be the neck now? After moving to (4,1), the snake body: new head at (4,1), then previous head (4,2) becomes segment 1, then (4,3), etc., and tail (3,4) moves? When I eat food, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n\nWhen I eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail stays in place for that turn, then next turn it moves.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat, head moves to food, tail doesn't move, so length increases by one.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (4,1) and eat, then new positions: head at (4,1), then (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) and new tail segment added, but where? Since tail didn't move, the new segment is added at the tail position, so tail is still (3,4), but now there is an additional segment there? No.\n\nLet's clarify the movement.\n\nTypically: on a move, the head moves to a new cell. If that cell has food, it is eaten, and the tail does not move, so the snake grows by one cell at the tail end. If no food, tail moves forward, so length same.\n\nPositions: after move, the head is at the new position, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n\nSo for example, if head moves from A to B, then segment behind moves to A, and so on, tail moves to the position of the second last segment.\n\nIf food eaten, after head moves to B, the tail does not move, so a new segment is added at the old tail position.\n\nIn positions list: after eating, the new head is at food cell, then the previous head position, then the rest, and the tail position is duplicated or something? No.\n\nSuppose before move: positions [H, S1, S2, ..., T]\n\nHead at H, S1 behind, etc., T tail.\n\nAfter move to new cell N:\n\nIf no food, new positions: [N, H, S1, ..., S_{k-1}] where S_{k-1} is the new tail, since T is left.\n\nPositions shift: head to N, then the segment that was at H moves to where? The segment that was behind head moves to H, etc.\n\nBetter: the new positions are [new_head, old_head, old_segment1, old_segment2, ..., old_tail] if no food eaten, but old_tail is left, so positions are [N, H, S1, S2, ..., S_{last-1}] and the last segment S_last (tail) is not included, since it moved away.\n\nStandard: when snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment ahead of it. So the tail cell is vacated.\n\nIf food is eaten, the head moves to the food cell, but the tail does not move; it stays, so a new segment is added at the tail, and the tail position remains occupied by the new segment.\n\nIn terms of positions list: after eating, the new positions are [new_head, old_head, old_segment1, ..., old_tail] and since tail didn't move, old_tail is still there, so the list has one more element.\n\nFor example, here, before move: positions: H=(4,2), S1=(4,3), S2=(4,4), S3=(4,5), S4=(3,5), S5=(2,5), S6=(2,4), T=(3,4)\n\nIf I move down to (4,1) and eat food, then new head is (4,1), then old_head (4,2) becomes segment 1, then S1=(4,3) becomes segment 2, ..., up to T=(3,4) becomes segment 8, and since eaten, tail doesn't move, so new segment added at old tail position, so new tail is still (3,4), but it's the same cell, so the segment at (3,4) is now the second last, and new tail at (3,4)? Confusion.\n\nAfter eating, the positions are: new head at (4,1), then the previous segments in order: so [ (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) ] and the tail is at (3,4), but (3,4) was the tail before, and now it's still there, so it's fine, the cell is occupied.\n\nThe new segment is the old tail position, so length increases.\n\nIn this case, after eating at (4,1), positions: head (4,1), then (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) — 9 segments, tail at (3,4).\n\nIf no eat, move to free cell, say (3,2), then new positions: head (3,2), then (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), and tail was (3,4) but it moves to where S6 was, S6 is (2,4), which was the second last, so after move, tail moves to (2,4)? Let's index.\n\nBefore: index 0: H (4,2), 1: (4,3), 2: (4,4), 3: (4,5), 4: (3,5), 5: (2,5), 6: (2,4), 7: (3,4) tail.\n\nMove to (3,2) no eat: new head (3,2), then body: index 0 was H, now segment 1 at (4,2), index 1 was (4,3), now segment 2 at (4,3), ..., index 6 was (2,4), now segment 7 at (2,4), and index 7 was tail (3,4), but since no eat, tail is not added, so the new tail is at the position where index 6 was, which is (2,4), and (3,4) is vacated.\n\nNew positions: [ (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) ] with tail at (2,4).\n\nLength 8, same as before.\n\nBack to decision.\n\nAt (4,2), I can move D to (4,1) to eat food, or L to (3,2), or R to (5,2).\n\nIf I eat at (4,1), I get +1 score, snake longer, but then I'm at (4,1), which is corner bottom, and I have to move from there.\n\nFrom (4,1), after eating, head at (4,1), direction would be D, but I just moved D, so I can move L, R, or U, but not D? Direction: after moving to (4,1), the head direction is the direction I moved, so D. Then from there, I can move L (left to (3,1)), R (right to (5,1)), or U (up to (4,2)), but (4,2) is now occupied by the neck, which is the second segment.\n\nAfter moving to (4,1), positions: head (4,1), then (4,2), (4,3), etc., so (4,2) is the body segment directly behind head, so I cannot move back to (4,2) because it's occupied, and it would be body collision.\n\nSo from (4,1), possible moves: L to (3,1) or R to (5,1), since U to (4,2) is blocked by body, D is out of bound or wall? y=1, D would be to (4,0), but y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n\nSo only L or R.\n\n(3,1) has food with L=2, so I can eat it if I go there.\n\n(5,1) has food with L=10.\n\nBut if I go to (4,1) first, then I can go to (3,1) or (5,1).\n\nIf I go directly to (3,1) from current position? From current head (4,2), I can move L to (3,2), then from there to (3,1) if I want.\n\nSimilarly for (5,1).\n\nBut let's think about the food at (3,1) with short life span. It must be eaten by turn 35, meaning on turn 35, if I am at (3,1) and eat it.\n\nTurn 34: I can move.\n\nIf I move to (4,1) on turn 34, I eat that food, then on turn 35, from (4,1), I can move to (3,1) and eat that food as well, since both are available.\n\nThen I eat two food in two turns.\n\nBut after eating (4,1) on turn 34, on turn 35 I can move to (3,1) and eat, or to (5,1) and eat.\n\nIf I go to (3,1) on turn 35, I eat it.\n\nLife span: (3,1) L=2 at turn 34, after turn 34, at turn 35 it has L=1, so I can eat it on turn 35.\n\nSimilarly, if I don't eat it on turn 35, it disappears.\n\nSo by going to (4,1) on turn 34, then to (3,1) on turn 35, I eat both.\n\nThen I have eaten two food, snake length +2.\n\nBut after that, I'm at (3,1), which is bottom left corner.\n\nFrom there, I can move U to (3,2), or R to (4,1), but (4,1) is occupied by body? After moves.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nTurn 34: start, head at (4,2), move D to (4,1), eat food. New positions: head (4,1), then (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) — 9 segments.\n\nDirection: since moved D, head direction D.\n\nTurn 35: from (4,1), move L to (3,1), eat food there. New positions: head (3,1), then (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), and tail at (3,4) but since eaten, tail doesn't move, so new segment at (3,4), positions: [ (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) ] 10 segments, tail at (3,4).\n\nHead at (3,1), direction L (since moved left).\n\nNow from (3,1), I can move U to (3,2), or R to (4,1), but (4,1) is occupied by body (second segment), so I cannot move there. D to (3,0) is wall, invalid. L to (2,1) or (1,1)? x=2,y=1 or x=1,y=1.\n\n(2,1) is not occupied, not wall, so possible.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) is available.\n\nBut first, at (3,1), possible moves: U to (3,2), L to (2,1), since R to (4,1) is body, D wall.\n\n(2,1) is free, I think.\n\nNow, after that, I need to think further.\n\nBut I also have food at (2,6) and (5,1), etc.\n\nAnother option: from current position (4,2), if I move L to (3,2), no eat, then from (3,2), I can move D to (3,1) to eat that food on turn 35.\n\nLet's compare.\n\nOption 1: move D to (4,1) on turn 34, eat, then L to (3,1) on turn 35, eat.\n\nScore +2, length 10.\n\nThen at (3,1), I need to move, say U to (3,2) or L to (2,1).\n\nIf I move U to (3,2), (3,2) is free? Currently, in initial state, (3,2) is not occupied, but after two moves, let's see positions.\n\nAfter turn 35, positions: head (3,1), body: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)\n\nSo (3,2) is not occupied, so I can move U to (3,2) on turn 36.\n\nThen from there, etc.\n\nBut (3,2) has no food, so no eat.\n\nNow, if from current position (4,2), I move L to (3,2) on turn 34, no eat, since no food at (3,2).\n\nNew positions: head (3,2), then (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), tail at (3,4)? Before move, tail was (3,4), after move no eat, tail moves to (2,4), since (2,4) was second last.\n\nBefore move: [ (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) ]\n\nMove to (3,2), no eat: new head (3,2), then body: [ (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) ] and tail was (3,4) but not included, vacated. So positions: [ (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) ] 8 segments, tail at (2,4).\n\nDirection: moved L, so head direction L.\n\nThen on turn 35, from (3,2), I can move D to (3,1) to eat food, since (3,1) has food.\n\nMove D: to (3,1), eat. New head (3,1), then body: [ (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) ] and since eaten, tail doesn't move, new segment at (2,4), so positions: [ (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) ] 9 segments, tail at (2,4).\n\nCompared to previous, I ate only one food so far, whereas in option 1 I ate two.\n\nIn this case, on turn 34 I didn't eat, on turn 35 I ate (3,1), so +1, length 9.\n\nWhereas in option 1, +2, length 10.\n\nSo better to eat (4,1) first, then (3,1).\n\nMoreover, if I don't eat (4,1) on turn 34, and go to (3,2), then on turn 35 I eat (3,1), but (4,1) is still there, I can go to it later.\n\nBut (4,1) has L=7, so plenty of time.\n\nHowever, by eating both, I get the points sooner, and I can plan to other food.\n\nBut I have to consider the board and risks.\n\nAnother food at (2,6) with L=4, so I need to eat it by turn 37.\n\nAlso, (5,1) with L=10.\n\nNow, after being at (3,1) with long snake, it might be harder to navigate.\n\nLet's think about the map.\n\nThe snake is currently in the bottom left area, and (2,6) is at top left, (2,6).\n\ny=6 is top row, but (4,6) is blocked, so (2,6) is available.\n\nFrom (3,1), if I go up, I can head towards (2,6).\n\nBut the snake body is around (4,4), (4,5), etc., so I need to avoid colliding.\n\nAlso, there is the tail reward danger to consider.\n\nNow, let's list all possible actions for the next few turns.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should consider a path to eat multiple food.\n\nFood locations: (3,1) must be eaten soon, (2,6) should be eaten within 4 turns, (4,1) and (5,1) can wait.\n\nBut (3,1) is urgent.\n\nSo I should prioritize eating (3,1) on turn 35.\n\nTo eat it on turn 35, I need to be adjacent to it on turn 34.\n\nOn turn 34, head at (4,2), adjacent cells: (4,1) D, (3,2) L, (5,2) R, and U (4,3) but (4,3) is body, so not possible.\n\nSo to be adjacent to (3,1) on turn 34, I need to be at (3,2) or (4,1) or (2,1) or (3,0), but (3,0) wall, (2,1) not adjacent directly from (4,2).\n\nFrom (4,2), I can move to (3,2) on turn 34, then from (3,2) I am adjacent to (3,1), so on turn 35 I can move D to (3,1) to eat.\n\nIf I move to (4,1) on turn 34, I am not adjacent to (3,1), since (4,1) to (3,1) is adjacent, but on turn 35 from (4,1) I can move to (3,1).\n\nSo both ways allow me to eat (3,1) on turn 35 if I want.\n\nBut if I move to (4,1) on turn 34, I eat (4,1) immediately, which is good.\n\nIf I move to (3,2) on turn 34, I don't eat, but I can eat (3,1) on turn 35.\n\nBut I miss the chance to eat (4,1) on turn 34, but I can eat it later.\n\nHowever, there might be a risk that if I don't eat (4,1) now, something else happens, but probably not.\n\nAnother thing: after eating (3,1), I am at (3,1), which is corner, and I have to move U or L.\n\nBut if I have a longer snake, it might be tighter.\n\nLet's consider the path to (2,6).\n\n(2,6) is at x=2,y=6, top row.\n\nCurrent head at (4,2).\n\nTo go to (2,6), I need to move left and up.\n\nBut there are obstacles: the snake body and the wall at (4,6) blocked.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), so I cannot go through there.\n\nAlso, the body is at (4,3) to (4,5), so the column x=4 from y=3 to 5 is occupied.\n\nIf I go to (4,1), I am at bottom, then I can go left to (3,1), then up.\n\nFrom (3,1), I can go to (3,2), then to (3,3), but (3,3) is free? Initial positions, (3,3) not occupied, but after moves, it might be.\n\nLet's sketch a plan.\n\nAlso, food at (2,6) needs to be eaten within 4 turns, so by turn 37.\n\nTurn 34,35,36,37: I can eat on turn 37.\n\nSo I have time.\n\nBut to reach (2,6) from (4,2), minimum distance: |dx|=2, |dy|=4, so Manhattan distance 6, so in 4 turns I can reach if no obstacles.\n\nBut with snake body, it might be tight.\n\nFrom (4,2), if I move L to (3,2) on turn 34, then to (3,1) on turn 35 eat, then from (3,1) on turn 36 move U to (3,2), but (3,2) might be occupied or not.\n\nAfter turn 35: if I ate at (3,1), positions head (3,1), body (3,2) if I moved from (3,2), in the scenario where I moved to (3,2) on 34 then to (3,1) on 35.\n\nOn turn 34: move to (3,2) no eat, positions: [ (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) ] tail at (2,4)\n\nOn turn 35: move to (3,1) eat, positions: head (3,1), then (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) and new tail at (2,4), so [ (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) ]\n\nNow on turn 36, from (3,1), I can move U to (3,2), but (3,2) is occupied by the second segment, so I cannot move there. L to (2,1), or if available, or D wall.\n\nSo only L to (2,1) or perhaps other, but (2,1) should be free.\n\nMove L to (2,1) on turn 36.\n\nNo food at (2,1), so no eat. New positions: head (2,1), then (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) and tail was (2,4) moves to where? After no eat, tail moves forward.\n\nPositions before move: [ (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) ] head (3,1), tail (2,4)\n\nMove to (2,1) no eat: new head (2,1), then body: [ (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) ] and tail (2,4) not included, vacated. So positions: [ (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) ] 9 segments, tail at (2,5).\n\nDirection moved L, so head direction L.\n\nNow from (2,1), I can move U to (2,2), or R to (3,1), but (3,1) is body, so only U to (2,2), or L to (1,1), or D wall.\n\n(2,2) is free, I think.\n\nMove U to (2,2) on turn 37.\n\nNo food.\n\nThen from (2,2), I can move U to (2,3), etc., towards (2,6).\n\nBut (2,6) is at y=6, so I need to go up.\n\nOn turn 37, I am at (2,2), and (2,6) has L=1, since at turn 37 it has countdown 1, can be eaten on turn 37.\n\nBut I am at (2,2), distance to (2,6) is |dy|=4, so I need 4 moves to reach, but on turn 37 I can be at (2,3) if I move U from (2,2), but (2,6) is at y=6, so to eat on turn 37, I need to be at (2,6) on turn 37, so I need to be adjacent on turn 36.\n\nOn turn 36, I was at (2,1), which is not adjacent to (2,6), so I cannot eat on turn 37 from here.\n\nLet's go back.\n\nTo eat (2,6) on turn 37, I need to be at (2,6) on turn 37, so on turn 36 I need to be adjacent to it, like at (2,5), (1,6), (3,6), or (2,7) but y=7 wall, so (2,5), (1,6), or (3,6).\n\n(2,5) is occupied by snake body currently, and may not be free.\n\n(1,6) is x=1,y=6, which is playable, not wall.\n\n(3,6) similarly.\n\nBut from my position, it might be hard to reach by turn 36.\n\nTurn 34: I am at (4,2) or wherever.\n\nIf I want to eat (2,6) on turn 37, I need to be at one of the adjacent cells on turn 36.\n\nPossible adjacent cells: (2,5), (1,6), (3,6), (2,7) invalid.\n\n(2,5) is currently occupied by the snake, and depending on moves, it might be free later.\n\n(1,6) and (3,6) are free.\n\nOn turn 36, I need to be at (1,6), (3,6), or (2,5) if free.\n\nFrom current turn 34, I have 2 moves to reach one of those by turn 36.\n\nBut from (4,2) to (1,6) or (3,6) in 2 moves: |dx| + |dy| min 2+4=6 for (1,6), too far; to (3,6) |dx|=1, |dy|=4, distance 5, can't in 2 moves.\n\nMinimum moves to (3,6) from (4,2): e.g., U,U,U,U,L or something, 5 moves.\n\nTo (2,5): from (4,2), |dx|=2, |dy|=3, distance 5, still far.\n\n(2,5) is at distance, but it is currently occupied, and it might be freed if the tail moves.\n\nThe tail is at (3,4), and as the snake moves, the tail will move, so (2,5) might be vacated.\n\nBut it takes time.\n\nFor example, if I move in a way that the tail moves, (2,5) could be free in a few turns.\n\nBut to reach (2,6) by turn 37, I need to be close.\n\nTurn 37 is 3 turns from now: turns 34,35,36,37.\n\nOn turn 37 I eat.\n\nSo I need to be at (2,6) on turn 37, so on turn 36 I need to be adjacent.\n\nWith 3 moves from turn 34 to turn 36 (since turn 34 move to position for turn 35, etc.).\n\nLet's count turns.\n\nAt the start of turn 34, I am at position P34.\n\nAfter I move, I am at P35 for turn 35.\n\nAfter turn 35 move, P36 for turn 36.\n\nAfter turn 36 move, P37 for turn 37.\n\nTo be at P37 = (2,6), on turn 37.\n\nOn turn 36, I need to be at a cell adjacent to (2,6), so I can move to it on turn 37.\n\nSo P36 must be one of (2,5), (1,6), (3,6).\n\nNow, from P34 = (4,2), I need to reach P36 in two moves: to one of those cells.\n\nBut from (4,2) to (2,5): |dx|=2, |dy|=3, min moves 5, impossible in 2 moves.\n\nTo (1,6): |dx=3, dy=4|, min 7 moves.\n\nTo (3,6): |dx=1, dy=4|, min 5 moves.\n\nAll greater than 2, so impossible to reach any adjacent cell to (2,6) by turn 36 from current position.\n\nTherefore, I cannot eat (2,6) on turn 37; the earliest I can eat is later.\n\n(2,6) has life span 4 at turn 34, so after turn 34, L=3 at turn 35, L=2 at turn 36, L=1 at turn 37, so it can be eaten on turn 37, and if not, gone on turn 38.\n\nSince I can't reach it by turn 37, I will miss this food if I don't act soon.\n\nBut with the current position and the body, it might be difficult to reach in time.\n\nFor example, from (4,2) to (2,6), min distance 2+4=6, and I have 4 turns to move (turns 34,35,36,37 to be there on 37), so 4 moves, which is possible if no obstacles.\n\nBut there are obstacles.\n\nFor instance, I can go directly: from (4,2) move L to (3,2), then U to (3,3), U to (3,4), but (3,4) is tail, but it might move.\n\nOn turn 34 move to (3,2), no eat.\n\nThen turn 35 move to (3,3), if free.\n\n(3,3) is not occupied initially, and after move, it might be free.\n\nAfter turn 34 move to (3,2): positions [ (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) ] tail at (2,4)\n\n(3,3) is free.\n\nTurn 35 move to (3,3) no eat, positions: head (3,3), then (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) and tail moves to (2,4)? Vacated, so positions [ (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) ] tail at (2,5)\n\nTurn 36 move to (3,4)? (3,4) was tail earlier, but now it might be free. (3,4) is not in positions, so free.\n\nMove to (3,4) no eat, positions: head (3,4), then (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5) and tail moves to (2,5), positions [ (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5) ] tail at (3,5)\n\nTurn 37 move to (3,5)? (3,5) is body, cannot. Or to (2,4), or (4,4), or (3,3) but all body.\n\nFrom (3,4), adjacent cells: U (3,5) is in body, D (3,3) is body, L (2,4) or R (4,4).\n\n(2,4): in positions, (4,4) is in positions, both occupied.\n\n(2,4) is index 4 in the list? Positions: [ (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5) ] so (2,4) not there, (4,4) is there.\n\n(2,4) is free? Not in the list, and not wall, so yes.\n\nSimilarly, R to (4,4) occupied.\n\nSo from (3,4) on turn 37, I can move L to (2,4) or D to (3,3) but (3,3) is body, occupied, so only L to (2,4) or U to (3,5) occupied, so only L to (2,4).\n\nMove to (2,4) no eat, positions: head (2,4), then (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) and tail moves to (3,5), positions [ (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) ] tail at (4,5)\n\nBut I am at (2,4), not at (2,6).\n\nTo reach (2,6), I need to go up.\n\nFrom (2,4) on turn 38, I can move U to (2,5), but (2,5) is not in positions, free? In the list above, (2,5) not there, so free.\n\nMove U to (2,5), no food, positions: head (2,5), then (2,4), (3,4), etc.\n\nThen to (2,6) on turn 39.\n\nBut (2,6) disappears after turn 37, so on turn 38 it is gone, so I miss it.\n\nLife span: at turn 34, L=4, so at turn 37, L=1, can be eaten on turn 37. On turn 38, it is gone, so I cannot eat it after turn 37.\n\nIn this path, on turn 37 I am at (2,4), not near (2,6), so I miss the food.\n\nTherefore, I need a different path to reach (2,6) sooner.\n\nPerhaps from current position, I can go directly up or left to head towards (2,6).\n\nBut there is the body at (4,3) to (4,5), so I can't go up from (4,2) because (4,3) is body.\n\nOnly options are D, L, R.\n\nR to (5,2) might be better to go around.\n\nAnother idea: since (2,6) is urgent, I should move towards it immediately.\n\nFrom (4,2), move L to (3,2), then on turn 35 move to (2,2) or (3,3), etc.\n\nBut to reach (2,6) fast.\n\nFor example, turn 34: move L to (3,2)\n\nTurn 35: move L to (2,2)  (assuming (2,2) free)\n\nTurn 36: move U to (2,3)\n\nTurn 37: move U to (2,4)\n\nTurn 38: move U to (2,5)\n\nTurn 39: move U to (2,6) but too late, (2,6) gone on turn 38.\n\nAt turn 37, I am at (2,4), not adjacent to (2,6), and (2,6) disappears after turn 37.\n\nSo I cannot eat it.\n\nThe only way is to be closer initially or have a shorter path.\n\nPerhaps go through the right side.\n\nBut it's too far.\n\nMaybe I can eat the food at (4,1) and (3,1) quickly, then move up via the left side.\n\nBut with a longer snake, it might be harder to maneuver.\n\nAnother thought: the tail is at (3,4), and if I move in a way that the tail moves, I can free up space.\n\nBut to reach (2,6) in time, it seems impossible from here.\n\nLet's calculate the earliest I can reach (2,6).\n\nFrom (4,2) to (2,6): min moves 6.\n\nWith 4 moves to turn 37 (turns 34,35,36,37), I can be there on turn 37 only if I move directly.\n\nBut there are obstacles.\n\nFor example, move L to (3,2) on 34, then U to (3,3) on 35, then U to (3,4) on 36, but (3,4) might be occupied or not.\n\nOn turn 34 move to (3,2): positions as before, (3,4) is not occupied, it was tail but moved.\n\nIn earlier simulation, when I moved to (3,2) on 34, positions [ (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) ] so (3,4) not there, free.\n\nOn turn 35 move to (3,3): positions [ (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) ] (2,4) vacated.\n\nOn turn 36 move to (3,4): positions [ (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5) ] tail at (3,5)\n\nOn turn 37 move to (2,4) or (3,5) or (4,4), but (3,5) is body, (4,4) body, so only (2,4) or (3,3) but (3,3) body, so only (2,4).\n\nNot to (2,6).\n\nFrom (3,4) I can move U to (3,5), but (3,5) is occupied, so I can't.\n\n(3,5) is in the body.\n\nSo I am stuck at (3,4) and can only move to (2,4) on turn 37.\n\nThen (2,6) is not eaten.\n\nSo I think it's impossible to eat (2,6) in time with the current position and body.\n\nTherefore, I should give up on (2,6) and focus on the other food.\n\n(2,6) will disappear, but I can eat the other food.\n\nThere is (4,1) and (5,1) with long life span.\n\nAlso, after eating them, I can explore other areas.\n\nBut the grid has limited space, and with internal obstacle.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (4,1) and (3,1) quickly, then move to (5,1) or up.\n\nLet's go back to the initial choice.\n\nOn turn 34, from (4,2), I can:\n\n- Move D to (4,1): eat food, score +1, to (4,1)\n\n- Move L to (3,2): no eat, to (3,2)\n\n- Move R to (5,2): no eat, to (5,2)\n\nIf I move D to (4,1), eat, then on turn 35, from (4,1), move to (3,1) or (5,1) to eat another food.\n\nSay move to (3,1) on turn 35, eat, score another +1, to (3,1)\n\nThen from (3,1), on turn 36, I can move L to (2,1) or U to (3,2), but U to (3,2) might be occupied.\n\nAfter turn 35, positions: head (3,1), body (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) tail at (3,4)\n\n(3,2) is not in positions, so free.\n\nSo from (3,1), I can move U to (3,2) on turn 36, no eat.\n\nThen from (3,2), on turn 37, I can move U to (3,3), etc.\n\nOr move L to (2,1) on turn 36.\n\nSimilarly, if I move R to (5,2) on turn 34, then I can go to (5,1) later.\n\nBut let's think about the tail reward danger.\n\nTail is at (3,4), and if I move in a way that head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, but in this case, no food at tail.\n\nFood is at (3,1), (2,6), (4,1), (5,1), not at tail.\n\nSo no immediate danger.\n\nPerhaps the best is to eat the two food at bottom.\n\nSo on turn 34, move D to (4,1) to eat.\n\nThen on turn 35, move L to (3,1) to eat.\n\nThen on turn 36, from (3,1), move U to (3,2) (since R to (4,1) body, D wall, L to (2,1) possible but let's go up).\n\nMove U to (3,2).\n\nThen on turn 37, from (3,2), I can move U to (3,3), or L to (2,2), or R to (4,2) but (4,2) is body, so U or L.\n\nSay move U to (3,3).\n\nThen on turn 38, to (3,4), but (3,4) might be tail or something.\n\nAfter turn 36: head at (3,2), body: after moving U from (3,1), no eat, positions: head (3,2), then (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) and tail at (3,4) but moved? Let's trace.\n\nAfter turn 35: positions [ (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) ] 10 segments.\n\nTurn 36: move U to (3,2) no eat.

So positions: [ (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) ] tail at (2,5).\n\nTurn 37: from (3,2), move U to (3,3) no eat.

The food at (3,1) has a life span of 2 at turn 34, meaning it must be eaten by turn 35 to avoid loss. The food at (4,1) and (5,1) have longer life spans (7 and 10, respectively), so they can be eaten later. The food at (2,6) has a life span of 4 but is too far to reach within the available turns due to the snake's current position and body obstacles, so it is abandoned to avoid unnecessary risk.\n\nThe initial plan focuses on eating (4,1) on turn 34 and (3,1) on turn 35, securing +2 score with minimal risk. After that, the snake moves upward to explore open spaces and avoid collisions, as the body is concentrated in the bottom-left area. Moving up also positions the snake to potentially access other areas later.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Immediate Moves (Turns 34-35):**  \n  - Turn 34: Move down (D) to (4,1) to eat the positive food there, increasing length and score.  \n  - Turn 35: Move left (L) to (3,1) to eat the positive food before it disappears.  \n  - This sequence is safe: (4,1) and (3,1) are accessible, and no tail reward danger exists (tail is at (3,4), not adjacent to head).\n\n- **Subsequent Moves (Turns 36-38):**  \n  - After eating, the snake is at (3,1) on turn 35. From there, moving up (U) to (3,2) on turn 36 avoids the body and walls.  \n  - Continuing up to (3,3) on turn 37 and (3,4) on turn 38 keeps the snake in open space, away from the body and obstacles.  \n  - This path is low-risk: (3,2), (3,3), and (3,4) are free cells based on the initial state and movement simulation.\n\n- **5+ Turns Ahead:**  \n  - Beyond turn 38, the snake can head toward (5,1) for another food source by moving right (e.g., to (4,4) or (5,4) if possible) or continue upward to explore the top-left area.  \n  - The food at (5,1) has a long life span (10), so there is ample time to reach it after clearing the current body congestion.  \n  - Survival is prioritized: the upward path avoids walls, internal obstacles, and body collisions. No immediate risks are present in the planned moves.\n\n### Action Plan for Turns 34-38:\n- Turn 34: D (down) – Eat (4,1), score +1, length increases.\n- Turn 35: L (left) – Eat (3,1), score +1, length increases.\n- Turn 36: U (up) – Move to (3,2), no food, safe exploration.\n- Turn 37: U (up) – Move to (3,3), no food, safe exploration.\n- Turn 38: U (up) – Move to (3,4), no food, safe exploration.\n\nThis plan ensures the snake eats the most urgent food, avoids all collisions, and positions itself for future food collection while thinking 5+ turns ahead.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 34: D\nTurn 35: L\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: U\nTurn 38: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 35.\n\nThe grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), and the borders are walls. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: head at (4,1), then (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4). So the snake has 9 segments. Head is at (4,1), and it's moving down, which is direction D. Moving down means increasing y? Let me confirm the coordinate system.\n\nTypically in grids, (x,y) with y increasing upwards or downwards? The movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1). So U (up) increases y, D (down) decreases y. That means y=0 is the bottom, y=7 is the top? Let's see the walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders. So y=0 is the bottom row, y=7 is the top row. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nBut snake head at (4,1), moving down. Down is (x,y-1), so from (4,1) moving down would go to (4,0). But y=0 is a wall, so it can't move there. That's a problem.\n\nCurrent head direction is D (down), and position (4,1). Moving down to (4,0) would hit the wall since y=0 is a border wall. But the snake is moving down, so on this turn, it must have come from above. Positions: [(4,1), (4,2), ...] so head at (4,1), then (4,2) which is above since y=2 > y=1, and moving down to (4,1)? I'm confused.\n\nList the positions in order: index 0: (4,1) head, index 1: (4,2), index 2: (4,3), index 3: (4,4), index 4: (4,5), index 5: (3,5), index 6: (2,5), index 7: (2,4), index 8: (3,4).\n\nHead is at (4,1), and the next segment is at (4,2), which has a higher y-coordinate. Since y increases upwards, (4,2) is north of (4,1). But the head direction is given as D, down. Down means decreasing y, so from a higher y to lower y.\n\nIf head is at (4,1) and previous position was (4,2) at the last turn, then moving from (4,2) to (4,1) is down, decreasing y, so direction D makes sense. But now, at (4,1), if it continues down, it would go to (4,0), which is y=0, a wall. So it can't move down; that would be a wall collision.\n\nBut in the movement constraints, it says I can choose to move in U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse. Current direction is D, so I can't move up immediately, because up is opposite to down.\n\nDirections: U and D are opposites, L and R are opposites.\n\nCurrent direction is D, so I cannot move U on the next turn because that would be instant reverse.\n\nBut moving D to (4,0) is invalid because it's a wall.\n\nSo possible moves from (4,1):\n\n- D: to (4,0) — wall, invalid\n\n- U: to (4,2) — but (4,2) is occupied by the snake body? Positions: (4,2) is the second segment, so it's part of the body. But let's see the collision rules.\n\nCollision: body collision if head touches any body segment. But note: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nTail segment: the last one is (3,4), but let's see where the tail is.\n\nPositions: head (4,1), then (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4). So tail is at (3,4).\n\nIf I move to a cell that will be vacated by the tail, it might be ok, but generally, moving to any body cell except the tail is collision.\n\nThe rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, if the head moves to the tail's current position, and the tail moves away, it's safe.\n\nSimilarly, for other cells, if it's not the tail, it's collision.\n\nNow, from (4,1), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (4,2) — (4,2) is occupied by the snake body, specifically the second segment. Is this the tail? No, tail is (3,4). So (4,2) is a body segment, not tail, so moving there would cause collision.\n\n- D: to (4,0) — wall, invalid\n\n- L: to (3,1) — is this free? Let's see what's at (3,1). Also, food positions: (3,1) has food? Food: (3,1,1,1), (2,6,3,1), (5,1,9,1)\n\n(3,1) has food with value 1, life span 1.\n\nBut (3,1) might be occupied or not. Snake positions: (4,1), (4,2), etc. No (3,1) in positions, so it should be free, except for possible food.\n\n- R: to (5,1) — (5,1) has food? (5,1,9,1) is food, so it's occupied by food, but food can be eaten if head moves there.\n\nNow, walls: x=0 and x=7 are borders, so (3,1) is x=3, y=1, which should be within bounds since x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, but borders are walls, so cells like (0,y) or (x,0) are walls? The wall cells are given as border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So for example, (x,0) for any x is wall, similarly (x,7), (0,y), (7,y).\n\n(3,1): x=3, y=1, y=1 is not 0 or 7, so it should be free, not wall.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1) should be free except for food.\n\nInternal obstacle: (4,6), which is not near here.\n\nSo from (4,1):\n\n- U: to (4,2) — occupied by snake body (second segment), not tail, so collision. Invalid.\n\n- D: to (4,0) — y=0, wall, invalid.\n\n- L: to (3,1) — free? Snake positions don't have (3,1), and no wall, so possible. But there is food at (3,1).\n\n- R: to (5,1) — similarly, free except for food at (5,1).\n\nAlso, the tail is at (3,4), which is not near.\n\nNow, current direction is D, so I cannot move U (opposite) immediately. But U is to (4,2), which is invalid anyway because of body collision, so not an option.\n\nL and R are perpendicular, so allowed.\n\nSo possible actions: L or R.\n\nNow, food: there are three food items:\n\n1. (3,1) with value 1, life span 1. Life span 1 means it disappears after this turn or next? \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for food at (3,1), life_span=1, so on this turn (turn 35), it has life_span 1. After this turn, it decreases to 0 and disappears. So if not eaten on this turn, it vanishes.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) life_span=3, so it has 3 turns left including this one, so disappears after turn 37? Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nLife_span N: present for N turns, including the current one. After N turns, it disappears.\n\nSo for (3,1), life_span=1, so it exists only on turn 35. If not eaten now, it's gone.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) life_span=3, so exists for turns 35,36,37, disappears after turn 37.\n\n(5,1) life_span=9, exists for 9 turns.\n\nAlso, values: all are positive food, since value=1 for all? Food positions: (3,1,1,1) — (x,y,value,life_span) I think.\n\nFormat: ( (x,y), value, life_span )\n\nIn input: \"(3, 1, 1, 1)\" — probably (x=3,y=1, value=1, life_span=1)\n\nSimilarly, (2,6,3,1) — (2,6) value=3? It says \"value and life span\", and for (2,6,3,1), it might be value=3, life_span=1? But it says \"value2, life_span2\" but in the text it's written as (2,6,3,1), which is ambiguous.\n\nLook: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (3, 1, 1, 1) - (2, 6, 3, 1) - (5, 1, 9, 1)\"\n\nI think it's (x,y, value, life_span) for each.\n\nFor (3,1,1,1): x=3,y=1, value=1, life_span=1\n\n(2,6,3,1): x=2,y=6, value=3, life_span=1? Life_span=1, but it says \"3,1\" which might be value=3, life_span=1\n\nSimilarly, (5,1,9,1): x=5,y=1, value=9, life_span=1? Life_span=1 for all? But (2,6) has value=3, life_span=3? I think I misread.\n\nThe text: \"(2, 6, 3, 1)\" and it says \"value2, life_span2\" but in the list, it's given as tuples.\n\nPerhaps it's (x,y, value, life_span)\n\nFor (3,1,1,1): x=3,y=1, value=1, life_span=1\n\n(2,6,3,1): x=2,y=6, value=3, life_span=1? But life_span=1 means it disappears after this turn.\n\nBut it says for (2,6,3,1) and then (5,1,9,1), so value=3 and value=9, but life_span for both is 1? That can't be right because (2,6) is listed with 3,1 which might be value=3, life_span=3? The description says \"value and life span\", so likely (x,y, value, life_span).\n\nIn the input: \"(2, 6, 3, 1)\" — I think it's (x=2,y=6, value=3, life_span=1) but life_span=1 means only this turn.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1,9,1) life_span=1.\n\nBut (2,6) has value=3, which is higher, but life_span=1, so must be eaten now or never.\n\n(3,1,1,1) also life_span=1.\n\n(5,1,9,1) life_span=1, value=9.\n\nAll foods have life_span=1? But (2,6,3,1) might be life_span=3? The text says \" (2, 6, 3, 1) \" and in the list, it's separate.\n\nPerhaps the \"3,1\" is value=3, life_span=1, but let's see the food description: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - (3, 1, 1, 1) - (2, 6, 3, 1) - (5, 1, 9, 1)\"\n\nI think it's a bit messy, but from context, (3,1,1,1) likely means x=3,y=1, value=1, life_span=1\n\n(2,6,3,1) x=2,y=6, value=3, life_span=1? But life_span=1 for all, but (2,6) has value=3, which is inconsistent with the first, but possible.\n\n(5,1,9,1) x=5,y=1, value=9, life_span=1\n\nBut life_span=1 for all, so all foods disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\nBut for (2,6,3,1), the \"3,1\" might be value=3, life_span=1, or value=1, life_span=3? The format says \"Value and Life Span\", so for each food, it's given as ( (x,y), value, life_span ), but in the text it's written without parentheses for the position.\n\nLook: \" (3, 1, 1, 1) \" and it's listed as a tuple, so I think it's (x,y, value, life_span) for each.\n\nFor (2,6,3,1), if value=3, life_span=1, then it must be eaten this turn.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1,9,1) value=9, life_span=1.\n\n(3,1,1,1) value=1, life_span=1.\n\nBut y=6 for (2,6) is near the top, since y=7 is top wall.\n\nAlso, the snake is at (4,1), which is bottom-left area.\n\nNow, back to moves.\n\nFrom (4,1), head, I can move L to (3,1) or R to (5,1), both have food with life_span=1, so if I move there, I eat the food.\n\nIf I move L to (3,1), I eat the food at (3,1), value=1, so snake length increases by 1, to 10 segments.\n\nSimilarly, if I move R to (5,1), eat food at (5,1), value=9, length +1.\n\nBut value=9 is much better than value=1, so I should prefer to eat the high-value food if possible.\n\nBut I need to think ahead for survival.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible moves for this turn.\n\nPossible actions: L or R (since U and D invalid or impossible)\n\nL: to (3,1) - eat food, value=1, snake grows to 10 segments.\n\nAfter moving, the new head is at (3,1), and the tail will move. Current tail is at (3,4), which will move to where? When snake moves, the head moves to new position, each segment moves to the next position, so the tail is removed unless food is eaten.\n\nIf food is eaten, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n\nSo if I move L to (3,1), eat food, so new positions: head at (3,1), then the old head (4,1) becomes new segment 1, then (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), and tail (3,4) stays because of growth. Let's list:\n\nCurrent positions: index 0: (4,1) head, 1: (4,2), 2: (4,3), 3: (4,4), 4: (4,5), 5: (3,5), 6: (2,5), 7: (2,4), 8: (3,4) tail.\n\nAfter moving left to (3,1), new head at (3,1), food eaten, so the tail doesn't move. New positions: head (3,1), then old head (4,1) becomes segment 1, then (4,2) segment 2, (4,3) seg3, (4,4) seg4, (4,5) seg5, (3,5) seg6, (2,5) seg7, (2,4) seg8, and (3,4) remains seg9 (tail). So snake has 9 segments? No, since food eaten, it grows, so the tail stays, so now 10 segments: positions: (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4).\n\nSimilarly, if I move right to (5,1), new head at (5,1), eat food value=9, new positions: (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) — same as above but head at (5,1) instead of (3,1).\n\nNow, after this move, the food at (2,6) is still there, but life_span=1, so after this turn, it disappears if not eaten, but since we're at turn 35, and food has life_span=1, it exists only on turn 35, so after this move, it's gone if not eaten.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\n(2,6) has life_span=1? From (2,6,3,1), if life_span=1, yes.\n\nBut let's confirm the life_span for (2,6).\n\nIn the input: \"(2, 6, 3, 1)\" and since it's \"value and life span\", I think value=3, life_span=1.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1,9,1) value=9, life_span=1.\n\n(3,1,1,1) value=1, life_span=1.\n\nSo all foods must be eaten this turn or they disappear.\n\nBut (2,6) is at y=6, far from the snake at y=1, so impossible to eat this turn.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1) is at x=5,y=1, adjacent right.\n\n(3,1) adjacent left.\n\nSo only (3,1) and (5,1) are reachable this turn.\n\nMoving to (5,1) gives higher value (9 vs 1), so I should move R to (5,1).\n\nBut is it safe? Let's check for immediate collision.\n\nMoving to (5,1): is there any body there? Snake positions: (4,1) is current head, (5,1) not in positions, so free, no collision. Wall? x=5,y=1 not border, so ok.\n\nAfter moving, head at (5,1), with growth, so positions include (5,1) and all previous except tail stays.\n\nBut I need to think about future turns.\n\nThe AI should think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nAfter this move, the snake is longer, and I need to avoid dying.\n\nAlso, there might be risks.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving R to (5,1).\n\nAfter turn 35, snake positions: head (5,1), then (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)\n\nHead direction: since I moved right, new direction is R (right).\n\nNow, for turn 36, I need to choose next move.\n\nPossible moves from (5,1): U, D, L, R.\n\nBut no instant reverse, current direction R, so cannot move L (left).\n\nU: to (5,2) — is this free? Let's see the grid.\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, internal obstacle (4,6).\n\n(5,2): not wall, not occupied by snake? Snake positions: (5,1) head, (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), etc. (4,2) is at (4,2), not (5,2). (5,2) not in positions, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, D: to (5,0) — y=0, wall, invalid.\n\nL: to (4,1) — but (4,1) is now the second segment, body, not tail. Tail is at (3,4). (4,1) is occupied, so moving there would collide.\n\nR: to (6,1) — not wall? x=6, y=1, x=6 not 0 or 7? x=7 is wall, so (6,1) should be free.\n\nx from 0 to 7, x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=6 is ok, y=1 ok.\n\nNo snake body at (6,1), so possible.\n\nSo from (5,1), possible moves: U to (5,2), or R to (6,1). L is invalid (reverse and body), D invalid (wall).\n\nNow, after eating at (5,1), the food is gone, and no other food since all had life_span=1 and not eaten except (5,1).\n\n(2,6) not eaten, disappears.\n\nSo for turn 36, no food on the board? But food might spawn later, but not specified, so assume only given food, no new food mentioned.\n\nThe state has only these foods, and after this turn, all disappear if not eaten, so board might be empty.\n\nBut I need to survive.\n\nNow, from (5,1), I can go U to (5,2) or R to (6,1).\n\nIf I go R to (6,1), head to (6,1), no food, so no growth, tail moves.\n\nCurrent tail (3,4) will be removed, so new positions: head (6,1), then (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) — tail is now (2,4), since (3,4) was tail and removed.\n\nPositions after turn 35: 0:(5,1), 1:(4,1), 2:(4,2), 3:(4,3), 4:(4,4), 5:(4,5), 6:(3,5), 7:(2,5), 8:(2,4), 9:(3,4) — 10 segments.\n\nAfter move to (6,1) on turn 36, no food eaten, so tail (3,4) is removed, head to (6,1), so new positions: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) — now 9 segments, tail at (2,4).\n\nHead direction R.\n\nThen turn 37, from (6,1), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nD to (6,0) wall invalid.\n\nL to (5,1) — (5,1) is now segment 1, body, not tail, collision.\n\nU to (6,2) — free?\n\nR to (7,1) — x=7, wall, invalid.\n\nSo only U to (6,2) possible? U to (6,2): not wall, no body, should be ok.\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut this is just one path.\n\nIf from (5,1) I go U to (5,2) on turn 36.\n\nHead to (5,2), no food (assume), so no growth, tail moves.\n\nPositions after turn 35: (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)\n\nAfter move U to (5,2), no food, so new positions: head (5,2), then (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) — tail at (2,4), since (3,4) removed.\n\n(4,2) is still there, but now at index different.\n\nNew head direction U.\n\nThen turn 37, from (5,2), possible moves: U to (5,3), D to (5,1), L to (4,2), R to (6,2).\n\nCurrent direction U, so cannot move D (down, opposite).\n\nD to (5,1): (5,1) is now segment 1, body, collision if move there.\n\nU to (5,3): free? Assume.\n\nL to (4,2): (4,2) is segment 3 in new positions? Positions: after turn 36: 0:(5,2), 1:(5,1), 2:(4,1), 3:(4,2), 4:(4,3), etc. So (4,2) is segment 3, body, not tail, so moving there would collide.\n\nR to (6,2): free.\n\nSo possible: U to (5,3) or R to (6,2).\n\nEtc.\n\nBut I need to think about the whole situation.\n\nThere is another food at (2,6) with value=3, but it has life_span=1, so only this turn. But the snake is at (4,1), (2,6) is at x=2,y=6, which is 5 units away in Manhattan distance, impossible to reach in one move, so cannot eat it. Similarly, the snake can't reach it this turn, so it will disappear.\n\nSo only options are to eat (3,1) or (5,1) this turn.\n\n(5,1) has higher value, so better to eat that.\n\nBut is there any risk?\n\nMoving to (5,1): after that, the snake is at (5,1) with body around.\n\nLet's see the grid layout.\n\nThe snake has a lot of body at y=1 to y=5, x=2 to x=4, but after moving to (5,1), it's extending to right.\n\nThe internal obstacle at (4,6) is not relevant now.\n\nAnother thing: the tail is at (3,4), which might be a point to consider.\n\nBut I think eating the high-value food is better.\n\nBut let's consider if I move L to (3,1) instead.\n\nIf I move L to (3,1) on turn 35, eat food value=1, new positions: head (3,1), then (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) — tail at (3,4).\n\nHead direction L (since moved left).\n\nThen turn 36, from (3,1), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nCurrent direction L, so cannot move R (right, opposite).\n\nD to (3,0) wall invalid.\n\nU to (3,2) — is it free? Snake positions: (3,1) head, (4,1), (4,2), etc. (3,2) not in positions, so free.\n\nL to (2,1) — free? (2,1) not occupied, no wall.\n\nR to (4,1) — (4,1) is segment 1, body, collision.\n\nSo possible: U to (3,2) or L to (2,1).\n\nIf U to (3,2), head to (3,2), no food, tail moves, so new positions: (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) — tail at (2,4), since (3,4) removed.\n\nHead direction U.\n\nThen turn 37, from (3,2), moves: U to (3,3), D to (3,1), L to (2,2), R to (4,2).\n\nCannot move D (opposite).\n\nD to (3,1): (3,1) is segment 1, body, collision.\n\nU to (3,3): free? Assume.\n\nL to (2,2): free? (2,2) not occupied.\n\nR to (4,2): (4,2) is segment 3, body, collision? Positions: 0:(3,2), 1:(3,1), 2:(4,1), 3:(4,2), so (4,2) is seg3, body, so moving to (4,2) would collide.\n\nSo possible U or L.\n\nIf I go U, to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut the point is, by eating (3,1), I get only value 1, whereas eating (5,1) gives 9, so better to go for (5,1).\n\nBut is there a risk with (5,1)?\n\nOne thing: the food at (5,1) is on the same row, but no issue.\n\nAnother point: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\nBut here, tail is at (3,4), head at (4,1), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so Manhattan distance 1.\n\n(4,1) and (3,4) are not adjacent; |dx|=1, |dy|=3, distance 4, not adjacent.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, moving R to (5,1) seems best for this turn.\n\nBut I need to think ahead for survival.\n\nAfter eating at (5,1), the snake is longer, and I need to navigate without hitting walls or body.\n\nThe board has an obstacle at (4,6), and walls.\n\nBut from (5,1), I can go up or right.\n\nIf I go right to (6,1), then to (6,2), etc., but I might get trapped.\n\nIf I go up to (5,2), then to (5,3), etc.\n\nThe area on the right is more open.\n\nx from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nSnake body is concentrated on the left and center.\n\nAfter moving to (5,1), positions: (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)\n\nSo the body occupies from x=2 to x=5, y=1 to y=5, but not all cells.\n\nFor example, (3,1) is free, (5,2) free, etc.\n\nFrom (5,1), going up to (5,2) seems safe, then I can go further up or right.\n\nGoing right to (6,1) is also safe, then to (6,2), etc.\n\nThe top-right area is free, except obstacle at (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is occupied by wall, so cannot go there.\n\nBut (5,6), (6,6), etc. might be free.\n\nI think it's manageable.\n\nWhereas if I eat the low-value food, I have less score, and similar situation.\n\nSo I think moving R to (5,1) is the best for turn 35.\n\nBut the answer should include multiple turns, think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nThe output should be a sequence of actions for several turns.\n\nBut I don't know the future states, so I need to plan a path.\n\nPerhaps for this turn, I can decide the move, and then for future turns, based on the state.\n\nBut since no new food is given, and after this turn no food, I need to just survive, avoid collision.\n\nThe snake can move around without eating, just not hit anything.\n\nSo let's plan a path after eating at (5,1).\n\nAfter turn 35: head at (5,1), direction R.\n\nTurn 36: I can choose to go U to (5,2) or R to (6,1).\n\nIf I go R to (6,1), then turn 37 from (6,1), only possible U to (6,2), since D wall, L body, R wall.\n\nThen turn 38 from (6,2), possible U to (6,3), D to (6,1) but (6,1) is previous position, but after move, positions change.\n\nAfter turn 36: move to (6,1), no food, so positions: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) — tail at (2,4)\n\nHead at (6,1), direction R.\n\nTurn 37: from (6,1), possible moves:\n\nU to (6,2): free\n\nD to (6,0): wall invalid\n\nL to (5,1): (5,1) is segment 1, body, collision\n\nR to (7,1): x=7 wall invalid\n\nSo only U to (6,2)\n\nMove to (6,2), no food, positions: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) — tail at (2,5)\n\nHead direction U.\n\nTurn 38: from (6,2), possible moves:\n\nU to (6,3): free\n\nD to (6,1): (6,1) is segment 1, body, collision? Positions: 0:(6,2), 1:(6,1), 2:(5,1), ... so (6,1) is seg1, body, so moving D to (6,1) would collide.\n\nL to (5,2): free? (5,2) not occupied\n\nR to (7,2): x=7 wall invalid\n\nSo possible U to (6,3) or L to (5,2)\n\nSay I go U to (6,3)\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut I can also go L to (5,2) etc.\n\nSimilarly, if from (5,1) I go U to (5,2) on turn 36.\n\nThen positions: (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) — tail (2,4)\n\nHead direction U.\n\nTurn 37: from (5,2), possible:\n\nU to (5,3): free\n\nD to (5,1): (5,1) seg1, body, collision\n\nL to (4,2): (4,2) is seg4? Positions: 0:(5,2), 1:(5,1), 2:(4,1), 3:(4,2), so (4,2) seg3, body, collision\n\nR to (6,2): free\n\nSo possible U or R.\n\nGo R to (6,2), then similar as before.\n\nThe snake can move to the right and up.\n\nTo survive long-term, I should move to an open area.\n\nThe bottom-right area is relatively free: cells like (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (6,3), (5,3), etc., while left has more body.\n\nAlso, the tail is moving, so paths might open up.\n\nFor example, if I go to (5,1) then to (5,2), then to (6,2), then to (6,3), etc., I can go to (6,7) but y=7 wall, so up to (6,6).\n\nSimilarly, I can avoid the obstacle.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nBut back to turn 35, I think moving R to (5,1) is best.\n\nThe other food at (2,6) is not reachable, so no choice.\n\nBut let's confirm the life_span for (2,6).\n\nIn the input: \"(2, 6, 3, 1)\" — I think value=3, life_span=1, so disappears after this turn.\n\nSimilarly, all foods have short life.\n\nSo for turn 35, action: R (right) to (5,1)\n\nThen for future turns, I need to output a sequence.\n\nBut the state may change, so I should only specify the action for turn 35, and then for each subsequent turn based on state, but since the output should be a sequence for several turns, I need to assume no new food or something.\n\nThe problem says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should plan a path for at least 5 turns.\n\nAlso, in the answer format, it's a sequence of actions for turns t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nSo for turn 35: R\n\nThen turn 36: from (5,1), I need to choose, say U to (5,2) for example.\n\nThen turn 37 from (5,2), say R to (6,2), and so on.\n\nBut let's define a path.\n\nAssume after turn 35, head at (5,1), direction R.\n\nTurn 36: move U to (5,2) — so action U\n\nNew head (5,2), direction U.\n\nPositions: (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4) — tail (2,4)\n\nTurn 37: from (5,2), possible U to (5,3) or R to (6,2) (since L and D invalid or collision)\n\nR to (6,2) is free, so move R to (6,2) — action R\n\nNew head (6,2), direction R? Moved right, so direction R.\n\nPositions: (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) — tail (2,5)\n\nTurn 38: from (6,2), possible U to (6,3) or L to (5,2) but (5,2) is seg1, body, collision? Positions: 0:(6,2), 1:(5,2), 2:(5,1), etc. so (5,2) is seg1, body, so moving L to (5,2) collide.\n\nD to (6,1): (6,1) not occupied, but is it free? (6,1) not in positions, so free.\n\nFrom (6,2), moves:\n\nU to (6,3): free\n\nD to (6,1): free, since not occupied\n\nL to (5,2): (5,2) is segment 1, body, collision\n\nR to (7,2): wall, invalid\n\nSo possible U or D.\n\nD to (6,1) is down, which is opposite to current direction? Current direction is R (right), D is down, not opposite. Opposites are U-D and L-R.\n\nR and D are perpendicular, so allowed.\n\nSo I can move D to (6,1) or U to (6,3).\n\nBut (6,1) is below, and y=1, but not wall.\n\nMoving to (6,1) might be ok, but let's see.\n\nTo go to open area, better to go up.\n\nSo move U to (6,3) — action U\n\nHead at (6,3), direction U.\n\nPositions: (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5) — tail (3,5)\n\nTurn 39: from (6,3), possible U to (6,4), D to (6,2), L to (5,3), R to (7,3) invalid.\n\nCurrent direction U, so cannot move D (opposite).\n\nD to (6,2): (6,2) is seg1, body, collision.\n\nU to (6,4): free\n\nL to (5,3): free? (5,3) not occupied\n\nR invalid\n\nSo possible U or L.\n\nSay move U to (6,4) — action U\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI can continue, but for the answer, I need only a few turns.\n\nSince no food, the main thing is to not get trapped.\n\nAnother path: from (5,1) on turn 36, go R to (6,1), then U to (6,2), etc., similar.\n\nI think for turn 35, moving R is clear.\n\nBut earlier I thought about the food at (3,1), but it's low value.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if moving to (3,1) allows me to eat other food, but no, all food disappears after this turn.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, for turn 35, action should be R.\n\nThen for the sequence, I can output actions for turns 35 to 40 or so.\n\nBut let's define a sequence.\n\nTurn 35: R\n\nThen, from above, I can say:\n\nTurn 36: U (to (5,2))\n\nTurn 37: R (to (6,2))\n\nTurn 38: U (to (6,3))\n\nTurn 39: U (to (6,4))\n\nBut at turn 38 from (6,2), I could go U or D, I chose U.\n\nFrom (6,3), turn 39, I could go U or L.\n\nTo be consistent, let's go up.\n\nTurn 40: from (6,4), if I go U to (6,5), etc.\n\nBut y=7 wall, so eventually need to turn.\n\nBut for 5 turns, it's fine.\n\nSince the grid is small, and snake is long, I need to find a loop or something to survive long-term, but not necessary for now.\n\nIn this case, after moving, the tail is at (2,4) or moving, so as the snake moves, the tail moves, freeing space.\n\nFor example, the body at (4,5), (3,5), etc. will be vacated over time.\n\nSo the snake can move in the bottom-right corner.\n\nTherefore, I think moving R to (5,1) is best.\n\nBut in the food, (5,1) has value=9, which is high.\n\nNow, about the life_span: for (2,6,3,1), is life_span=3? I think I have confusion.\n\nLet's read the input carefully.\n\n\"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (3, 1, 1, 1) - (2, 6, 3, 1) - (5, 1, 9, 1)\"\n\nAnd the description: \"value and life span\"\n\nFor (2,6,3,1), it could be value=3, life_span=1 or value=1, life_span=3? But the pattern: first food (3,1,1,1) likely x=3,y=1, value=1, life_span=1\n\nSecond (2,6,3,1) x=2,y=6, value=3, life_span=1? But it says \"3,1\" which might be ambiguous.\n\nThird (5,1,9,1) x=5,y=1, value=9, life_span=1\n\nBut for (2,6,3,1), if life_span=1, it disappears after this turn.\n\nBut let's see the value: it says \"value2, life_span2\" but in the list, it's not labeled.\n\nI think it's safe to assume that (2,6,3,1) means value=3, life_span=1, as per the sequence.\n\nMoreover, if life_span were 3, it might be written differently.\n\nSo I think all foods have life_span=1, so only turn 35.\n\nThus, for turn 35, move R to (5,1).\n\nSo the action for turn 35 is R.\n\nThen for the sequence, I'll output a few more.\n\nSince the answer should start from turn 35.\n\nAlso, the head direction after move will be used for no reverse.\n\nIn the sequence, I need to specify actions.\n\nSo let's say:\n\nTurn 35: R (to (5,1), eat food)\n\nTurn 36: U (to (5,2))\n\nTurn 37: R (to (6,2))\n\nTurn 38: U (to (6,3))\n\nTurn 39: U (to (6,4))\n\nTurn 40: U (to (6,5)) — but y=5, not wall, y=7 wall.\n\nAt (6,5), I can go to (6,6) or (5,5), etc.\n\nBut for 5 turns, up to turn 39 or 40.\n\nThe current turn is 35, think 5+ ahead, so actions for 35 to 40.\n\nBut in the sequence, I need to make sure no collision.\n\nFor example, on turn 38, moving to (6,3), is it free? In earlier, yes.\n\nSimilarly, all should be fine.\n\nIf I had moved to (3,1), I could go up, but less score.\n\nSo I think R is best.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 35):**\n- **Snake Position**: Head at (4,1), moving down (D). Full body: [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)] (9 segments).\n- **Walls**: Borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7; internal obstacle at (4,6).\n- **Food**:\n  - (3,1): Value=1, Life-span=1 (disappears after turn 35).\n  - (2,6): Value=3, Life-span=1 (disappears after turn 35).\n  - (5,1): Value=9, Life-span=1 (disappears after turn 35).\n- **Constraints**: \n  - Cannot move opposite to current direction (D) immediately, so U is invalid for turn 35.\n  - Moving D to (4,0) hits wall (y=0 border).\n  - Moving U to (4,2) hits body (occupied by second segment).\n  - Valid moves: L to (3,1) or R to (5,1), both with food.\n\n**Immediate Decision (Turn 35):**\n- Eating (5,1) (value=9) is far better than (3,1) (value=1) for score.\n- (2,6) is unreachable (Manhattan distance=5, only 1 move available).\n- Moving R to (5,1) is safe: no collision (cell free) and no wall.\n- After eating, snake grows to 10 segments. New head position: (5,1), direction R.\n\n**Long-Term Survival Plan (5+ Turns Ahead):**\n- After turn 35, no food remains (all life-span=1, not eaten except (5,1)). Focus on avoiding collisions and navigating open areas.\n- **Key Risks**: \n  - Body collisions: Snake is long (10 segments), concentrated in left-center (x=2-5, y=1-5). Right side (x=5-6, y=2+) is safer.\n  - Walls: Borders and obstacle at (4,6) must be avoided.\n- **Path Plan for Turns 36-40**:\n  - **Turn 36**: From (5,1), move U to (5,2) – avoids wall and body, heads to open area.\n  - **Turn 37**: From (5,2), move R to (6,2) – continues right to less crowded space.\n  - **Turn 38**: From (6,2), move U to (6,3) – moves away from bottom wall.\n  - **Turn 39**: From (6,3), move U to (6,4) – progresses upward safely.\n  - **Turn 40**: From (6,4), move U to (6,5) – stays in open right side; y=5 is safe (y=7 wall distant).\n- **Why this path?** \n  - Prioritizes right-top area (x=5-6, y=2-6), which has fewer body segments and avoids the internal obstacle (4,6).\n  - Tail movement frees space over time (e.g., tail at (2,4) on turn 35 moves away), reducing collision risk.\n  - If needed beyond turn 40, snake can turn east/west (e.g., to (5,5) or (6,6)) to loop and survive indefinitely.\n\n**Risk Mitigation**:\n- No \"Tail Reward Danger\": Tail at (3,4) not adjacent to head at (4,1) on turn 35.\n- All moves adhere to \"no instant reverse\" and avoid walls/body.\n- Score maximized: +9 from (5,1) vs. +1 from (3,1).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 35: R (right)  \nTurn 36: U (up)  \nTurn 37: R (right)  \nTurn 38: U (up)  \nTurn 39: U (up)  \nTurn 40: U (up)  \n}",

        "step": 36,
        "score": 9,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 36, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: the head is at (5,1), and the body segments follow: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4). Let me list them in order:\n\n- Head: (5,1)\n\n- Segment 1: (4,1)\n\n- Segment 2: (4,2)\n\n- Segment 3: (4,3)\n\n- Segment 4: (4,4)\n\n- Segment 5: (4,5)\n\n- Segment 6: (3,5)\n\n- Segment 7: (2,5)\n\n- Segment 8: (2,4)\n\n- Segment 9: (3,4)\n\nThe snake has 10 segments. Positions are given as a list from head to tail, so index 0 is head, index 1 is first body segment, and so on, up to index 9 which is the tail.\n\nTail is at (3,4).\n\nHead direction is R, which means it's moving right. So from (5,1), moving right would go to (6,1).\n\nBut there are walls at x=7, so moving right to (6,1) is possible since x=6 is within bounds (x from 0 to 7, so x=6 is ok, not a wall).\n\nx=7 is wall, so x=6 is fine.\n\nNow, food: there's one food item at (2,6) with value 1 and life span 3. So it's positive food, +1 score and snake length increases by 1 when eaten. Life span is 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns, including the current turn? The problem says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo at turn 36, life span is 3, so it will disappear after turn 38? Let's see.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\".\n\nSo at turn t, if life_span is L, it will be present on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappear at the start of turn t+L.\n\nStandard interpretation: if life_span is N at turn t, it decreases by 1 each turn, so after N turns, it's gone. For example:\n\n- Turn t: life_span = N\n\n- Turn t+1: life_span = N-1\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn t+N-1: life_span = 1\n\n- After turn t+N-1, at turn t+N, it disappears.\n\nBut the food can be eaten on any turn it exists.\n\nIn this case, at turn 36, food at (2,6) has life_span=3, so it can be eaten on turns 36, 37, 38. On turn 39, it disappears.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nCurrent head position: (5,1), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R. But since current direction is R, I cannot do an instant reverse to L, because that would be opposite direction. So I can go U, D, or R, but not L.\n\nNo instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. So from R, I cannot go L immediately.\n\nSo options: U (up), D (down), R (right).\n\nNow, let's see what each move does:\n\n- R (right): to (6,1)\n\n- U (up): to (5,2)\n\n- D (down): to (5,0)\n\nBut y=0 is a wall, so D to (5,0) is invalid, collision with wall. So D is not possible.\n\ny=0 is a wall border, so moving to (5,0) is death.\n\nSimilarly, x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n\nSo possible moves: U or R. D is invalid.\n\nNow, let's check the grid positions.\n\nFirst, what's at (6,1)? Is it occupied by snake body?\n\nSnake positions: head at (5,1), then (4,1), (4,2), etc. So (6,1) is not in the list, so it should be empty, no body.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2): not in snake positions, so empty.\n\nBut there might be food or obstacles.\n\nObstacles: internal obstacle at (4,6), which is not near here.\n\nFood at (2,6), far away.\n\nSo both (6,1) and (5,2) seem safe to move to.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, tail is at (3,4), but since the snake moves, the tail will move when the head moves, unless it eats food.\n\nIf I move to a cell without food, the snake moves forward, head to new position, tail moves off the last position.\n\nIf I eat food, head moves to food, new segment added, so tail stays, length increases.\n\nIn this case, no food at (6,1) or (5,2), so if I move there, snake moves, tail at (3,4) moves off, so that cell is freed.\n\nNow, the food at (2,6) is available, but I need to get there safely.\n\nLife span 3, so I have until turn 38 to eat it.\n\nCurrent turn 36, so turns 36,37,38 to eat.\n\nI should plan a path to eat it if possible.\n\nBut first, let's see the snake body to avoid collisions.\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- (5,1) head\n\n- (4,1)\n\n- (4,2)\n\n- (4,3)\n\n- (4,4)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (3,5)\n\n- (2,5)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (3,4) tail\n\nThe body forms a sort of loop or something? Let's plot this.\n\nGrid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nHead at (5,1)\n\nThen down? (4,1) is left? From (5,1) to (4,1) is left, then to (4,2) up, then to (4,3) up, to (4,4) up, to (4,5) up, then to (3,5) left, to (2,5) left, to (2,4) down, to (3,4) right.\n\nSo the snake is coiled around.\n\nSpecifically, from (4,5) to (3,5) left, to (2,5) left, then down to (2,4), then right to (3,4).\n\nSo the tail is at (3,4), and when snake moves, if no food eaten, tail moves away from (3,4).\n\nNow, food at (2,6), which is above (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is a body segment, and food is at (2,6), so directly above it.\n\nBut to eat it, the head must move to (2,6), but currently head is far away.\n\nAlso, special case: food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nHere, food at (2,6) is not under body? (2,5) is body at y=5, food at y=6, so different cell, not under.\n\n(2,6) is empty, I think, since not in snake positions.\n\nSnake has (2,5) and (2,4), but not (2,6), so (2,6) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, no wall there.\n\nBut to reach it, I need a path.\n\nFirst, for current turn, I have to choose between U and R.\n\nIf I go R to (6,1), that might be safe, but let's see the grid.\n\nx=6,y=1: not wall, not body, should be ok.\n\nIf I go U to (5,2), also ok.\n\nBut I need to think about future moves to get the food.\n\nAlso, there might be risks.\n\nAnother thing: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut here, tail is at (3,4), head at (5,1), not adjacent. Adjacent would be same x or y diff by 1.\n\n(5,1) and (3,4): dx=2, dy=3, not adjacent.\n\nSo no issue now.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should try to eat the food at (2,6) since it's positive.\n\nBut I need to get there safely.\n\nFirst, from head (5,1), possible moves:\n\nOption 1: R to (6,1)\n\nThen from (6,1), direction is R, so next moves can be U, D, L, but not R? Current direction after move: if I move R, head is now at (6,1), direction R, so next turn I can go U, D, R, but not L (opposite).\n\nBut D to (6,0) is wall, y=0, so invalid. So from (6,1), possible: U to (6,2), R to (7,1), but x=7 is wall, so R to (7,1) invalid. Or L to (5,1), but (5,1) is where the neck is, but after moving, the body moves, so (5,1) will be occupied by the first body segment.\n\nAfter moving head to (6,1), the new positions: head at (6,1), then body: (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), and tail was (3,4) but since no food eaten, tail moves off, so the new tail is (2,4)? Let's see the segment indices.\n\nOriginal positions: index 0: (5,1) head, index 1: (4,1), index 2: (4,2), ..., index 9: (3,4) tail.\n\nAfter moving head to new position without eating, new head at new position, and all segments shift, so new index 0: (6,1), index 1: (5,1), index 2: (4,1), index 3: (4,2), ..., up to index 9: (2,4)? Original index 9 is tail (3,4), but when shifting, the tail is removed, so the new snake has segments from new head to the second last of old.\n\nStandard snake movement: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail cell is vacated.\n\nSo positions: old head at (5,1), moves to new head position, say P.\n\nThen body segment that was at index 1 moves to (5,1), index 2 moves to where index 1 was, and so on, index 9 (tail) moves to where index 8 was, and the cell where index 9 was is empty.\n\nIn this case, if head moves to (6,1), then:\n\n- New head: (6,1)\n\n- New segment 1: old head position (5,1)\n\n- New segment 2: old segment 1 position (4,1)\n\n- New segment 3: old segment 2 position (4,2)\n\n- ...\n\n- New segment 9: old segment 8 position (2,4)? Let's list old indices:\n\nOld: idx0: (5,1), idx1: (4,1), idx2: (4,2), idx3: (4,3), idx4: (4,4), idx5: (4,5), idx6: (3,5), idx7: (2,5), idx8: (2,4), idx9: (3,4)\n\nAfter move to (6,1) no eat:\n\n- New idx0: (6,1)  // new head\n\n- New idx1: (5,1)  // old idx0\n\n- New idx2: (4,1)  // old idx1\n\n- New idx3: (4,2)  // old idx2\n\n- New idx4: (4,3)  // old idx3\n\n- New idx5: (4,4)  // old idx4\n\n- New idx6: (4,5)  // old idx5\n\n- New idx7: (3,5)  // old idx6\n\n- New idx8: (2,5)  // old idx7\n\n- New idx9: (2,4)  // old idx8\n\nOld idx9 (3,4) is vacated.\n\nSimilarly, if I move up to (5,2), new head (5,2), new idx1: (5,1), new idx2: (4,1), etc., new idx9: (2,5)? Old idx8: (2,4), old idx9: (3,4), so new idx9: old idx8 position (2,4)? Let's not get bogged down.\n\nFor now, back to current choice.\n\nIf I go R to (6,1), then from there, I can go U to (6,2) or L to (5,1), but (5,1) will be occupied by the body after the move.\n\nIn the new state, (5,1) is occupied by the first body segment, so I cannot move there.\n\nSimilarly, D to (6,0) wall, R to (7,1) wall, so only possible move from (6,1) is U to (6,2).\n\nThen from (6,2), I can go U, D, L, R, but need to see direction.\n\nIf I go U from (6,1) to (6,2), direction U, so next I can go U, L, R, not D.\n\nBut let's see if this helps me reach (2,6).\n\n(2,6) is at x=2,y=6, I'm at (6,1) or (5,1), so I need to go left and up.\n\nBut there is an obstacle at (4,6), which is on the way.\n\n(4,6) is wall, so I cannot go there.\n\nAlso, the snake body is in the way.\n\nFor example, from (5,1), if I go U to (5,2), then I can go further up or left.\n\n(5,2) is safe, I think.\n\nThen from (5,2), direction U (if I moved U), so I can go U, L, R, not D.\n\nU to (5,3), L to (4,2), but (4,2) is body? In current state, (4,2) is body, but after move, it might be different.\n\nLet's simulate one move ahead.\n\nFirst, at turn 36, I need to choose action for turn 36.\n\nOption A: Move R to (6,1)\n\nThen new head at (6,1), direction R.\n\nThen for turn 37, from (6,1), only possible move is U to (6,2), since D wall, R wall, L to (5,1) but (5,1) is now body segment.\n\nAfter moving to (6,1), positions: head (6,1), body: (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)\n\nSo (5,1) is occupied, so moving L to (5,1) is collision.\n\nD to (6,0) wall, R to (7,1) wall, so only U to (6,2) possible.\n\nSo on turn 37, move U to (6,2).\n\nNew head at (6,2), direction U.\n\nThen for turn 38, from (6,2), I can go U to (6,3), D to (6,1) but (6,1) is now body segment? After turn 37 move, positions: from (6,2) head, body: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), and tail (2,4)? Let's track.\n\nAfter turn 36 move to (6,1): positions: head (6,1), seg1 (5,1), seg2 (4,1), seg3 (4,2), seg4 (4,3), seg5 (4,4), seg6 (4,5), seg7 (3,5), seg8 (2,5), seg9 (2,4)  // old idx8\n\nAfter turn 37 move to (6,2): head to (6,2), no eat, so new head (6,2), seg1 to old head (6,1), seg2 to old seg1 (5,1), seg3 to old seg2 (4,1), seg4 to old seg3 (4,2), seg5 to old seg4 (4,3), seg6 to old seg5 (4,4), seg7 to old seg6 (4,5), seg8 to old seg7 (3,5), seg9 to old seg8 (2,5)\n\nOld seg9 (2,4) vacated.\n\nSo positions: head (6,2), body: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nFrom (6,2), direction U, so possible moves: U to (6,3), D to (6,1) but (6,1) is body, collision, L to (5,2), R to (7,2) wall. So only U to (6,3) possible? (5,2) is free? Not in positions, and no wall, so (5,2) is empty.\n\n(5,2) is not occupied, so I can go L to (5,2).\n\nDirection U, so from (6,2), moving L to (5,2) is left, which is perpendicular, not opposite, so allowed.\n\nOpposite would be D, but D is to (6,1), which is body, not possible.\n\nU to (6,3), L to (5,2), R to (7,2) wall, D to (6,1) body, so possible: U or L.\n\nIf I go U to (6,3), or L to (5,2).\n\nBut I need to get to (2,6), which is left and up.\n\n(6,2) to (2,6) is far.\n\nBut food at (2,6) must be eaten by turn 38.\n\nTurn 36: I can eat on 36,37,38.\n\nIf on turn 36 I move, I don't eat food, since no food at (6,1) or (5,2).\n\nOn turn 37, if I'm at (6,2), no food there.\n\nOn turn 38, wherever I am, if I reach (2,6), I can eat.\n\nBut from (6,2) on turn 37, it's hard to reach (2,6) by turn 38, since I need to move left 4 steps and up 4 steps, but I can only move one cell per turn, so minimum Manhattan distance is 8, impossible to reach in one or two moves.\n\nFrom (6,2) to (2,6): dx=4, dy=4, distance 8, but on turn 37 I'm at (6,2), turn 38 I can move to adjacent, say (6,3) or (5,2), both are still far from (2,6), distance at least 7 or 6, not reachable in one move. So I cannot eat the food on turn 38 from this path.\n\nIf I choose R at turn 36, I end up at (6,1) then (6,2) by turn 37, and by turn 38 I'm at (6,3) or (5,2), nowhere near (2,6), so I miss the food.\n\nBut food disappears after turn 38, so if not eaten by turn 38, it's gone.\n\nSo with this move, I cannot eat the food.\n\nNow, option B at turn 36: move U to (5,2)\n\nThen new head at (5,2), direction U (since I moved up).\n\nThen positions: head (5,2), seg1 (5,1), seg2 (4,1), seg3 (4,2), ..., up to seg9 (2,5)? Old tail (3,4) vacated.\n\nOld positions: idx0 (5,1), idx1 (4,1), idx2 (4,2), idx3 (4,3), idx4 (4,4), idx5 (4,5), idx6 (3,5), idx7 (2,5), idx8 (2,4), idx9 (3,4)\n\nAfter move U to (5,2) no eat: new head (5,2), seg1 (5,1) old head, seg2 (4,1) old seg1, seg3 (4,2) old seg2, seg4 (4,3) old seg3, seg5 (4,4) old seg4, seg6 (4,5) old seg5, seg7 (3,5) old seg6, seg8 (2,5) old seg7, seg9 (2,4) old seg8\n\nOld seg9 (3,4) vacated.\n\nNow, from (5,2), direction U, so for turn 37, possible moves: U to (5,3), D to (5,1) but (5,1) is seg1, body, collision, so cannot. L to (4,2), R to (6,2).\n\n(4,2) is now seg3 position? In new positions, seg3 is at (4,2), so occupied. Similarly, (6,2) is free.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (5,3) or R to (6,2), since D and L are occupied or invalid.\n\nD to (5,1) is body, L to (4,2) is body, so only U or R.\n\nIf U to (5,3), or R to (6,2).\n\nNow, to reach (2,6), I need to go left.\n\nFrom (5,2), going U to (5,3) or R to (6,2) doesn't help much; I need to go left.\n\nBut L to (4,2) is blocked by body.\n\nSimilarly, on turn 37, if I go U to (5,3), then from there, I might go left, but let's see.\n\nFood at (2,6) with life span 3 at turn 36.\n\nAfter turn 36, if I move U, life span decreases to 2 for turn 37.\n\nAt turn 37, food at (2,6) with life span 2, meaning it can be eaten on turn 37 or 38.\n\nBut to eat it, I need the head at (2,6) on turn 37 or 38.\n\nCurrently at turn 36, head at (5,1), after U to (5,2), head at (5,2) for turn 37 start.\n\nFrom (5,2), I can only go U or R, not left, because left is blocked.\n\nIf I go U to (5,3) on turn 37, head to (5,3), then from there, I can go U, D, L, R, but D to (5,2) is body, so not, etc.\n\nBut (5,3) to (2,6) is dx=3, dy=3, distance 6, not reachable in one move to (2,6) on turn 38.\n\nSimilarly, if I go R to (6,2) on turn 37, even farther.\n\nSo from (5,2), I cannot reach (2,6) by turn 38.\n\nTherefore, with either choice at turn 36, U or R, I cannot eat the food because the path is blocked, and I'm too far.\n\nBut is there a way to go left earlier?\n\nAt turn 36, I cannot go left because current direction is R, and L is opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo only U or R.\n\nBut U or R both lead to positions where I can't go left immediately.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the body might move, freeing space.\n\nFor example, if I go U at turn 36 to (5,2), then on turn 37, from (5,2), I go R to (6,2), then positions change.\n\nAfter turn 36 U to (5,2): positions as above.\n\nThen turn 37, say I go R to (6,2): new head (6,2), seg1 (5,2), seg2 (5,1), seg3 (4,1), seg4 (4,2), seg5 (4,3), seg6 (4,4), seg7 (4,5), seg8 (3,5), seg9 (2,5)\n\nOld seg9 (2,4) vacated earlier.\n\nNow from (6,2), direction R (since I moved right from (5,2)? From (5,2) to (6,2) is right, so direction R.\n\nThen for turn 38, from (6,2), I can go U to (6,3), D to (6,1) but (6,1) is not occupied? Positions: seg2 is at (5,1), (6,1) is free? Not in positions, so (6,1) is empty.\n\n(6,1) is empty, I can go D to (6,1).\n\nOr L to (5,2), but (5,2) is now seg1 position, body, collision.\n\nR to (7,2) wall.\n\nU to (6,3).\n\nSo possible U to (6,3) or D to (6,1).\n\nBut (2,6) is far, so on turn 38, I can't reach it.\n\nIf on turn 37 from (5,2) I go U to (5,3), then head at (5,3), direction U.\n\nThen for turn 38, from (5,3), I can go U to (5,4), D to (5,2) body, L to (4,3), or R to (6,3).\n\n(4,3) is seg4 position? After turn 37 move to (5,3): positions: head (5,3), seg1 (5,2), seg2 (5,1), seg3 (4,1), seg4 (4,2), seg5 (4,3), seg6 (4,4), seg7 (4,5), seg8 (3,5), seg9 (2,5)\n\nSo (4,3) is seg5 position, occupied.\n\n(6,3) free.\n\nL to (4,3) occupied, so only U to (5,4) or R to (6,3).\n\n(2,6) not reachable.\n\nSo indeed, from current position, I cannot reach (2,6) by turn 38 to eat the food, because I'm at (5,1) and need to move left, but I can't immediately, and the body is blocking the left path.\n\nTherefore, the food at (2,6) cannot be eaten; it will disappear without being eaten.\n\nSo I should ignore it and focus on survival and future opportunities.\n\nBut there are no other foods listed, only one food at (2,6).\n\nThe food list has only one: (2,6,3,1)\n\nSo no other food.\n\nBut I need to survive and be ready for new food to spawn, I assume, but the problem doesn't say how food spawns; it just gives the current state.\n\nIn this state, only one food.\n\nBut I have to play for multiple turns, so I need to move safely.\n\nPerhaps new food appears later, but not specified, so I should assume only this food for now, but since I can't eat it, I need to avoid dying.\n\nNow, back to choices.\n\nAt turn 36, I can go U or R.\n\nIf I go R to (6,1), then as before, I must go U to (6,2) on turn 37, then on turn 38, from (6,2), I can go U to (6,3) or L to (5,2).\n\n(5,2) is free at that point.\n\nAfter turn 37 move to (6,2), positions as above: head (6,2), body (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nSo (5,2) is empty.\n\nFrom (6,2) on turn 38, I can go L to (5,2) or U to (6,3).\n\nIf I go L to (5,2), then head to (5,2), direction L.\n\nThen positions: new head (5,2), seg1 (6,2), seg2 (6,1), seg3 (5,1), etc., but I need to think about the future.\n\nThe grid has walls, and internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is wall, so I cannot go there.\n\nAlso, the area around (4,5) and (3,5) has body, but it might move.\n\nSince I can't eat the food, I should try to stay in open areas to avoid trapping myself.\n\nLet's list all occupied cells after moves.\n\nPerhaps I can go towards the center or something.\n\nAnother idea: the tail is moving, so cells are freeing up.\n\nFor example, the tail is at (3,4) currently, but after moves, it moves.\n\nIn the R path, if I go R on 36, U on 37, then on 38, if I go L to (5,2), then from (5,2), I can go U, D, L, R, but D to (5,1) may be occupied or not.\n\nAfter moving to (5,2) on turn 38, positions: head (5,2), seg1 (6,2), seg2 (6,1), seg3 (5,1), seg4 (4,1), seg5 (4,2), seg6 (4,3), seg7 (4,4), seg8 (4,5), seg9 (3,5)\n\nSo (5,1) is seg3, occupied, (4,2) seg5, occupied, (6,2) seg1, occupied, (5,3) free, (4,2) occupied, so from (5,2), I can go U to (5,3) or R to (6,2) but (6,2) is body, collision, L to (4,2) body, D to (5,1) body, so only U to (5,3) possible.\n\nThen from (5,3), and so on, I might get stuck going up, but there is a wall at y=7, so at y=6, I have obstacle at (4,6), but (4,6) is wall, so at y=6, x=4 is blocked.\n\nIf I keep going up, to (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), then at (5,6), I can go U to (5,7) but y=7 wall, or L to (4,6) wall, or R to (6,6), or D.\n\nBut (6,6) might be free, but I need to see.\n\nBut this is risky if I go that way.\n\nSimilarly, with U move at turn 36.\n\nLet's consider the U move at turn 36.\n\nMove U to (5,2) on turn 36.\n\nThen on turn 37, I can go U to (5,3) or R to (6,2).\n\nIf I go U to (5,3), then on turn 38, from (5,3), only U to (5,4) or R to (6,3), since L and D occupied.\n\nThen keep going up.\n\nIf on turn 37 I go R to (6,2), then from (6,2) on turn 38, I can go U to (6,3) or D to (6,1), since L to (5,2) occupied.\n\nThen from (6,3), etc.\n\nBut in all cases, I'm moving away from the left side, and the food is there but I can't reach it.\n\nPerhaps I should accept that I can't eat the food and focus on not dying.\n\nBut I need to think 5 turns ahead for survival.\n\nLet's simulate both options for a few turns.\n\nFirst, option: turn 36 R to (6,1)\n\nThen turn 37 must U to (6,2)\n\nThen turn 38: from (6,2), can go U to (6,3) or L to (5,2)\n\nSuppose I go L to (5,2) on turn 38.\n\nThen head to (5,2), direction L.\n\nPositions: after move, head (5,2), seg1 (6,2), seg2 (6,1), seg3 (5,1), seg4 (4,1), seg5 (4,2), seg6 (4,3), seg7 (4,4), seg8 (4,5), seg9 (3,5)\n\nThen turn 39: from (5,2), direction L, so can go U, D, L, not R (opposite).\n\nU to (5,3), D to (5,1) but (5,1) is seg3, occupied, L to (4,2) but (4,2) is seg5, occupied, so only U to (5,3) possible.\n\nGo U to (5,3), direction U.\n\nPositions: head (5,3), seg1 (5,2), seg2 (6,2), seg3 (6,1), seg4 (5,1), seg5 (4,1), seg6 (4,2), seg7 (4,3), seg8 (4,4), seg9 (4,5)\n\nThen turn 40: from (5,3), direction U, can go U to (5,4), D to (5,2) body, L to (4,3), R to (6,3).\n\n(4,3) is seg7 position, occupied, (6,3) free, so U to (5,4) or R to (6,3).\n\nIf U to (5,4), etc., or R to (6,3).\n\nIf I go R to (6,3), then head (6,3), direction R.\n\nThen turn 41: from (6,3), can go U to (6,4), D to (6,2), L to (5,3), R to (7,3) wall.\n\n(6,2) is seg2 position? After previous, positions: after turn 40 move to (6,3): head (6,3), seg1 (5,3), seg2 (5,2), seg3 (6,2), seg4 (6,1), seg5 (5,1), seg6 (4,1), seg7 (4,2), seg8 (4,3), seg9 (4,4)\n\nSo (6,2) is seg3, occupied, (5,3) is seg1, occupied, so from (6,3), U to (6,4) free, D to (6,2) body, L to (5,3) body, R wall, so only U to (6,4).\n\nThen I'm going up, and eventually at y=6, I have to turn because of wall at y=7 and obstacle at (4,6).\n\nAt (6,6), I can go L to (5,6) or D, etc., but it might be tight.\n\nSimilarly, with the U option at turn 36.\n\nTurn 36 U to (5,2)\n\nThen turn 37, say U to (5,3)\n\nThen turn 38, from (5,3), U to (5,4) or R to (6,3)\n\nSay U to (5,4)\n\nThen turn 39, from (5,4), U to (5,5) or R to (6,4) or L to (4,4) but (4,4) may be occupied.\n\nAfter turn 38 move to (5,4): let's track positions.\n\nAfter turn 36 U to (5,2): head (5,2), seg1 (5,1), seg2 (4,1), seg3 (4,2), seg4 (4,3), seg5 (4,4), seg6 (4,5), seg7 (3,5), seg8 (2,5), seg9 (2,4)\n\nAfter turn 37 U to (5,3): head (5,3), seg1 (5,2), seg2 (5,1), seg3 (4,1), seg4 (4,2), seg5 (4,3), seg6 (4,4), seg7 (4,5), seg8 (3,5), seg9 (2,5)\n\nAfter turn 38 U to (5,4): head (5,4), seg1 (5,3), seg2 (5,2), seg3 (5,1), seg4 (4,1), seg5 (4,2), seg6 (4,3), seg7 (4,4), seg8 (4,5), seg9 (3,5)\n\nThen turn 39: from (5,4), direction U, can go U to (5,5), D to (5,3) body, L to (4,4), R to (6,4).\n\n(4,4) is seg7 position, occupied, (6,4) free, so U to (5,5) or R to (6,4).\n\nIf U to (5,5), then to (5,6), then at (5,6), can go U to (5,7) wall, L to (4,6) wall, R to (6,6), D to (5,5) body, so only R to (6,6).\n\nThen from (6,6), etc.\n\nBut in both cases, I'm moving to the top-right, and the left side is freeing up, but with no food, it's ok.\n\nBut I have an internal obstacle at (4,6), which is wall, so at (5,6), I can only go R to (6,6) or D.\n\nBut D might be occupied.\n\nThe key point is that in the current position, going U or R both seem similar, but let's see if one is safer.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (2,6) is on the body, but not under, it's at (2,6), and (2,5) is body, but if the body moves, it might be eatable.\n\nFor example, if I can get the head to (2,6) when it's free.\n\nBut as we saw, I can't reach it in time.\n\nOn turn 36, the body at (2,5) is a segment, and food is at (2,6), not on the same cell.\n\nTo eat (2,6), I need to move head there when it's empty.\n\nBut as calculated, from current position, minimum moves to (2,6) is |5-2| + |1-6| = 3 + 5 = 8 moves, and I have only 2 moves (turn 37 and 38) to be there on turn 38, impossible.\n\nSo I must abandon the food.\n\nNow, for survival, I should avoid going into corners.\n\nWith U move at turn 36, I go to (5,2), then I can on turn 37 go R to (6,2), which is more open.\n\nWith R move at turn 36, I go to (6,1), then U to (6,2), same as above.\n\nFrom (6,2), I can go to (6,3) or (5,2), etc.\n\nBut let's see the board.\n\nGrid: walls at borders and (4,6).\n\nThe snake body occupies from (4,1) to (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4) but moving.\n\nCurrently, the area around (3,4) to (2,5) might free up.\n\nFor example, the tail is at (3,4), and as I move, it moves.\n\nIn the U path, if I go U at 36, then on 37 I go R to (6,2), then positions: head (6,2), body (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nSo (2,4) and (3,4) are free.\n\nThen I can move left from there.\n\nBut from (6,2), I can go to (5,2) but occupied, only U or D if possible.\n\nFrom (6,2), after turn 37 move, for turn 38, I can go U to (6,3) or D to (6,1).\n\nIf I go D to (6,1), then head to (6,1), direction D.\n\nThen positions: head (6,1), seg1 (6,2), seg2 (5,2), seg3 (5,1), seg4 (4,1), seg5 (4,2), seg6 (4,3), seg7 (4,4), seg8 (4,5), seg9 (3,5)\n\nThen turn 39: from (6,1), direction D, can go U to (6,2) body, D to (6,0) wall, L to (5,1), R to (7,1) wall.\n\n(5,1) is seg3 position, occupied, so no possible move! Stuck.\n\nIf I go D to (6,1) on turn 38 from (6,2), I get stuck on turn 39 because all directions blocked.\n\nTherefore, going D to (6,1) is bad.\n\nOn turn 38 from (6,2), I should go U to (6,3) instead.\n\nThen from (6,3), I can go U to (6,4), L to (5,3), etc.\n\nBut in the U move at turn 36, if on turn 37 I go U to (5,3) instead of R.\n\nTurn 36 U to (5,2)\n\nTurn 37 U to (5,3)\n\nThen turn 38 from (5,3), U to (5,4) or R to (6,3)\n\nIf U to (5,4), then to (5,5), etc., as before.\n\nBut at (5,6), I can only go R to (6,6) since U wall, L wall.\n\nThen from (6,6), I can go U to (6,7) wall, L to (5,6) body, R to (7,6) wall, D to (6,5), so only D to (6,5).\n\nThen from (6,5), I can go D to (6,4), L to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut it might be ok.\n\nTo avoid dead ends, perhaps going R at turn 36 is better because I can then go to (6,2) and have more options.\n\nLet's see the initial choice.\n\nAt turn 36, if I go R to (6,1), then turn 37 U to (6,2), then turn 38 I can go L to (5,2) or U to (6,3).\n\nIf I go L to (5,2), then as before, on turn 39 I must go U to (5,3), and so on.\n\nBut on turn 38, from (6,2), going L to (5,2) is better than U to (6,3) because it keeps me more central.\n\nSimilarly, with U at turn 36, I can on turn 37 go R to (6,2), same as above.\n\nSo both choices can lead to the same state.\n\nTurn 36:\n\n- If R to (6,1), then turn 37 U to (6,2), state: head at (6,2), direction U, body as before.\n\n- If U to (5,2), then turn 37 R to (6,2), state: head at (6,2), direction R, body similar.\n\nIn both cases, on turn 37, I reach (6,2) with different directions, but the position is the same.\n\nAfter turn 37, positions are identical in both paths.\n\nIf turn 36 R to (6,1): positions after: head (6,1), body (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)\n\nThen turn 37 U to (6,2): head (6,2), body (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nIf turn 36 U to (5,2): positions after: head (5,2), body (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)\n\nThen turn 37 R to (6,2): head (6,2), body (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nIn the first case, body includes (6,1) and (5,1), in the second case, body includes (5,2) and (5,1), so different.\n\nIn first: after turn 37, body has (6,1), (5,1), etc.\n\nIn second: body has (5,2), (5,1), etc.\n\nSo the body is different.\n\nIn first: (6,1) is occupied, in second (5,2) is occupied.\n\nBut for the head at (6,2), in both cases, the possible moves are similar.\n\nFor example, on turn 38, from (6,2), in first case (R then U path), positions: head (6,2), body (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nSo (5,2) is free.\n\nIn second case (U then R path), positions: head (6,2), body (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nSo (6,1) is free.\n\nIn both cases, from (6,2), I can go U to (6,3) or in first case L to (5,2) which is free, or in second case D to (6,1) which is free.\n\nBut in first case, D to (6,1) is body, not free.\n\nIn first case, (6,1) is body, so I can only go U or L to (5,2).\n\nIn second case, (5,2) is body, so I can only go U or D to (6,1).\n\nAnd as we saw, if I go D to (6,1), I might get stuck later.\n\nIn first case, if I go L to (5,2), then on turn 39 I must go U to (5,3), etc.\n\nBut going U to (6,3) is common.\n\nTo have more space, going R at turn 36 might be better because then on turn 38 I can go L to (5,2) which is towards the center, whereas with U at 36, on turn 38 I might be tempted to go D to (6,1) which is risky.\n\nBut I can choose not to go D.\n\nIn the U at 36 path, on turn 38 from (6,2), I can go U to (6,3) instead of D.\n\nSimilarly, in R at 36 path, on turn 38 I can go U to (6,3) or L to (5,2).\n\nSince the food is not eatable, and I need to survive, I should choose a move that keeps options open.\n\nPerhaps both are similar, but let's see the direction.\n\nAnother idea: the internal obstacle at (4,6) might affect.\n\nBut at (4,6), it's wall, so I need to avoid it.\n\nSince the snake is long, I should try to uncoil or something, but it's hard.\n\nFor turn 36, I can choose U or R.\n\nBut D is invalid, so only two choices.\n\nPerhaps I can go U to (5,2), then on turn 37 go U to (5,3), then on turn 38 go U to (5,4), and so on, but I hit the top.\n\nOr I can go R to (6,1), U to (6,2), then L to (5,2), then U to (5,3), etc.\n\nBut in the L to (5,2) move, from (6,2) to (5,2), it's left, so if direction was U, moving L is ok.\n\nThen from (5,2), I can go U to (5,3), as before.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating.\n\nSince the food is not reachable, and no other food, I should just move in a way that doesn't trap me, and since both U and R are similar, I can choose one.\n\nBut the problem says to think 5+ turns ahead, but with no food, it's about survival.\n\nPerhaps new food will spawn, but not specified.\n\nSo for now, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe answer format is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., for a few turns.\n\nBut how many? It doesn't specify, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan for 5 turns or so.\n\nBut in the output, I need to specify actions for each turn.\n\nPerhaps for the current turn and a few ahead.\n\nBut I have to decide for turn 36 first.\n\nLet's assume that I go R at turn 36 to (6,1), as it might be slightly better for moving right.\n\nOr U to (5,2) to go up.\n\nBut let's look at the snake body: the body is mainly on the left, so moving right might free space.\n\nIn current positions, the left side has body, so moving right might be better to explore new areas.\n\nSimilarly, the food is on left, but I can't reach it.\n\nSo I think going R at turn 36 is reasonable.\n\nThen turn 37 U to (6,2)\n\nThen turn 38, I can go L to (5,2) to center.\n\nSo actions: turn 36: R, turn 37: U, turn 38: L\n\nBut I need to output for turn 36 only? No, the answer format says to output for multiple turns.\n\n\"Answer Format\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn \\(t_1\\): action on turn t_1\nTurn \\(t_1 + 1\\): action on turn t_1 + 1\n...\n}\"\n\nSo I need to provide a sequence of actions for several turns.\n\nBut how many? Not specified, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide 5 or 6 turns.\n\nBut I have to decide based on the state.\n\nPerhaps for this state, I can provide actions for turns 36 to 40 or something.\n\nLet's make a plan.\n\nTurn 36: move R to (6,1)\n\nThen turn 37: move U to (6,2) (only choice)\n\nThen turn 38: from (6,2), I can choose to move L to (5,2) or U to (6,3)\n\nMoving to (5,2) is better because (5,2) is free and it's towards the center, while (6,3) is up, might lead to corner.\n\nSo move L to (5,2)\n\nThen turn 39: from (5,2), as before, only U to (5,3) possible\n\nThen turn 40: from (5,3), I can move U to (5,4) or R to (6,3)\n\nSay move R to (6,3) to avoid going up directly.\n\nThen turn 41: from (6,3), move U to (6,4) or other, but let's stop at 5 turns.\n\nTurn 36 to 40.\n\nBut turn 36 is current, then 37,38,39,40, that's 5 actions.\n\nSimilarly, if I start with U at 36.\n\nBut let's stick with R.\n\nAlso, for the food, since I can't eat it, it will disappear.\n\nBut on turn 38, if I'm at (5,2), and food at (2,6) is still there with life span 1, but I can't reach it.\n\nLife span: at turn 36, life span 3, so turn 36:3, turn 37:2, turn 38:1, turn 39:0, disappear.\n\nSo on turn 38, it is there, but I'm at (5,2), not close.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, I think for turn 36, move R.\n\nThen the sequence:\n\nTurn 36: R\n\nTurn 37: U (only choice)\n\nTurn 38: L (to (5,2))\n\nThen turn 39: U (to (5,3), only choice)\n\nTurn 40: from (5,3), can go U to (5,4) or R to (6,3)\n\nI think R to (6,3) is better to go right and have more space.\n\nSo turn 40: R\n\nThen etc.\n\nBut I need to output only for the turns, but the state might change with food, but no other food.\n\nSo for now, I'll go with that.\n\nIn the U option at turn 36, if I go U to (5,2), then turn 37 I can go R to (6,2), then turn 38 from (6,2) I can go U to (6,3) or D to (6,1), but D to (6,1) is bad, so U to (6,3), then similar.\n\nBut in that case, on turn 38 I'm at (6,3), while in the other path I'm at (5,2) on turn 38, which is better for accessing left side.\n\nSo R at 36 seems better.\n\nFinal decision.\n</think>\n### Analysis for Turn 36\n\n**Current State Summary:**\n- **Grid Size:** 8x8 (walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacle at (4,6)).\n- **Snake:** Head at (5,1), direction right (R). Positions: [(5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4)] (10 segments).\n- **Food:** One positive food at (2,6) with value +1 and life span 3 (disappears after turn 38).\n- **Immediate Moves:** Current direction is R, so cannot reverse to L. D (down) to (5,0) is invalid (wall at y=0). Valid moves are U (up to (5,2)) or R (right to (6,1)).\n\n**Key Constraints and Risks:**\n- **Food Accessibility:** The food at (2,6) cannot be reached by turn 38 due to Manhattan distance (from (5,1) to (2,6) is |5-2| + |1-6| = 3 + 5 = 8 cells, requiring at least 8 turns; only 2 turns remain to act by turn 38). Thus, the food will expire uneaten, and we ignore it for planning.\n- **Survival Priority:** With no other food present, focus on avoiding dead ends and maintaining mobility. The snake is long (10 segments), so we must avoid coiling into traps, especially near walls (y=7) and the obstacle at (4,6).\n- **Move Simulation:** \n  - **Option U (to (5,2)):** Leads to limited choices; on turn 37, only U or R is possible, and continuing up risks trapping near y=7 and (4,6) by turn 40-41.\n  - **Option R (to (6,1)):** Allows better path flexibility. After R, turn 37 must be U (to (6,2)), then turn 38 can be L (to (5,2)) to center the snake and avoid top rows. This path frees space faster as the tail moves away from (3,4)/(2,4).\n\n**5-Turn Survival Plan (Turns 36-40):**\n- **Turn 36 (Current):** Move R to (6,1) – Best for opening space on the right and avoiding immediate left-body block.\n- **Turn 37:** Must move U to (6,2) – Only safe move (D is wall, L and R blocked by body/wall).\n- **Turn 38:** Move L to (5,2) – Centers the snake, avoids upward trap, and leverages freed cells (e.g., (3,4) vacated).\n- **Turn 39:** Move U to (5,3) – Only safe move (D, L, R blocked by body after shift).\n- **Turn 40:** Move R to (6,3) – Avoids forcing upward; keeps options open for future horizontal/vertical moves.\n\n**Why This Sequence?**\n- **Long-Term Safety:** By turn 40, the snake is at (6,3) with potential moves to (6,4), (5,3) (if free), or (7,3) (invalid, so not considered). This position is away from walls and obstacles, reducing collision risk.\n- **Risk Mitigation:** Avoids the top-right corner (near y=7 and (4,6)) where movement would be restricted by turn 41. Moving right initially exploits the open right side.\n- **Food Consideration:** The food at (2,6) is unattainable, so no score gain is possible; survival is prioritized.\n\n**Output Actions:**\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 36: R (right)\nTurn 37: U (up)\nTurn 38: L (left)\nTurn 39: U (up)\nTurn 40: R (right)\n}",

        "step": 37,
        "score": 9,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. It's turn 37, and I have to plan my moves for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nThe grid has walls. Border cells are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid with walls on the edges. There's also an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: The head is at (6,1), and the body segments follow: (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4). So the snake is 10 segments long. Head direction is right (R), meaning it's moving east.\n\nFood items:\n\n- One at (2,6) with value 1 and life span 2. So it will disappear after 2 turns, including the current turn. Since it's turn 37, it will vanish after turn 38? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 37, life span is 2; after turn 37, it becomes 1; after turn 38, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 37 or 38.\n\n- Another food at (5,4) with value 1 and life span 10. So it has a long time before it disappears.\n\nBoth foods have value +1, so they're positive food.\n\nNow, I need to think about possible moves. Since the head is moving right, from (6,1) to (7,1)? But x=7 is a wall, so moving right would hit the wall. Head is at (6,1), moving right to (7,1), but x=7 is a border wall, so that's a wall collision. I can't move there.\n\nAvailable moves: I can move up (U), down (D), left (L), or right (R), but right is into a wall, so invalid. Also, I cannot move opposite to current direction instantly. Current direction is R, so opposite is L. But since the head is moving, the direction is for the head movement.\n\nCurrent head direction is R, so I cannot move left on the next turn? No, the rule is: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nSo, since current direction is R, I cannot move L on turn 37. That means for turn 37, possible moves are U, D, or R. But R is into wall, so only U or D are possible.\n\nHead at (6,1). Moving up to (6,2), or down to (6,0). But y=0 is a wall, so down to (6,0) is also a wall. y=0 is a border wall, so (6,0) is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, x=7 is wall, so (7,1) invalid.\n\nSo from (6,1), possible moves:\n\n- Up: (6,2)\n\n- Down: (6,0) but y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n\n- Left: (5,1) but that's where the body is? (5,1) is the first body segment.\n\nMoving left to (5,1): is that a collision?\n\nCollision rule: Body collision if head touches any body segment. But there's an exception: you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, because the tail will move away.\n\nLet's see the snake positions: head (6,1), then (5,1), (4,1), etc.\n\n(5,1) is directly adjacent and is a body segment, not the tail. The tail is at (2,4), I think.\n\nSnake positions: [(6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)]\n\nSo the body segments are: index 1: (5,1), index 2: (4,1), ..., up to index 9: (2,5), and tail is (2,4).\n\nIf I move left to (5,1), that is currently occupied by the first body segment. Since it's not the tail, moving there would cause a collision because the head touches the body before the body moves. But according to the rules, when you move, the head moves first to a new cell, then the body follows. So if I move to a cell that was occupied by a body segment, it might be okay if that segment moves away.\n\nThe rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, general rule: if the head moves to a cell that is occupied by a body segment, it's a collision unless it's the tail segment.\n\nIn this case, (5,1) is occupied by the first body segment, which is not the tail. The tail is (2,4). So moving to (5,1) would cause collision because after the head moves to (5,1), the body segment that was there hasn't moved yet; it will move to where the head was, but during the move, the head is on a body cell.\n\nTypically in Snake, when you move, the head moves to a new cell, and if that cell is not free, it might collide. Specifically, if it's a body cell except the tail.\n\nHere, (5,1) is a body cell and not the tail, so moving left to (5,1) should be a collision.\n\nSimilarly, moving up to (6,2) or down to (6,0).\n\n(6,0) is a wall, so invalid.\n\n(6,2) might be free? Let's see what cells are occupied.\n\nCurrent snake positions:\n\n(6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4)\n\nSo (6,2) is not in this list, so it should be free, unless it's a wall or food.\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7 or y=0,7, and internal (4,6)\n\n(6,2) is within bounds, x=6,y=2, not a wall, so it should be empty.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1) is occupied by body, (6,0) is wall.\n\nAlso, moving right to (7,1) is wall.\n\nSo for turn 37, possible actions:\n\n- Up (U) to (6,2)\n\n- Down (D) to (6,0) but y=0 wall, invalid\n\n- Left (L) to (5,1) but occupied by body, collision\n\n- Right (R) to (7,1) wall, invalid\n\nSo only possible move is Up to (6,2). Is that right?\n\nBut left to (5,1) is occupied, so yes, only Up is possible? But that seems dangerous if (6,2) is near something, but let's see.\n\nI need to consider the food and plan ahead.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible cells.\n\nGrid from x=0 to x=7, y=0 to y=7.\n\nWalls: all border cells, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nFood at (2,6) and (5,4).\n\nLife span: (2,6) has life span 2, so if not eaten by turn 38, it disappears. (5,4) has life span 10, so it will be around for a while.\n\nNow, snake head at (6,1), direction R.\n\nFor turn 37, only possible move without dying is Up to (6,2), since left is body, down is wall, right is wall.\n\nConfirm: down to (6,0) is y=0, which is wall, so death.\n\nLeft to (5,1): (5,1) is occupied by the second segment, which is body, not tail, so moving there would cause collision. Yes.\n\nRight to (7,1) is x=7 wall.\n\nSo only Up to (6,2) is safe for turn 37.\n\nAfter moving to (6,2), the snake will have new positions: head to (6,2), then the body: since the head moves, the first body segment moves to where head was, (6,1), then next to (5,1), and so on, but the tail moves away from (2,4), so the cell (2,4) becomes empty, but (5,1) is now where the second segment is moving to, etc.\n\nWhen head moves to (6,2), the positions become: head (6,2), then the previous head position (6,1) becomes the new position for the first body segment, which was (5,1). So the segment that was at (5,1) moves to (6,1), the segment that was at (4,1) moves to (5,1), and so on, down to the tail.\n\nCurrent positions before move: index 0: (6,1) head, 1: (5,1), 2: (4,1), 3: (4,2), 4: (4,3), 5: (4,4), 6: (4,5), 7: (3,5), 8: (2,5), 9: (2,4) tail.\n\nAfter moving head to (6,2):\n\n- New head: (6,2)\n\n- Body: segment 1 moves to old head (6,1)\n\n- Segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was, (5,1)\n\n- Segment 3 moves to where segment 2 was, but segment 2 was at (4,1), so segment 3 moves to (4,1)\n\nLet's think: the body segments shift: the first body segment moves to the head's previous position, which is (6,1).\n\nThen the second body segment moves to the previous position of the first body segment, which was (5,1).\n\nThen the third body segment moves to the previous position of the second body segment, which was (4,1).\n\nFourth body segment was at (4,2), moves to where third was? No.\n\nThe segments are connected; each segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the chain.\n\nAfter head moves to (6,2):\n\n- The segment that was at index 1 (5,1) moves to index 0's old position (6,1)\n\n- The segment that was at index 2 (4,1) moves to index 1's old position (5,1)\n\n- The segment that was at index 3 (4,2) moves to index 2's old position (4,1)\n\n- The segment that was at index 4 (4,3) moves to index 3's old position (4,2)\n\n- Index 4 was (4,3), moves to where index 3 was? Index 3 was at (4,2), so moves to (4,2)\n\nPerhaps better to list:\n\nNew positions:\n\n- Head: (6,2)\n\n- Segment 1: moves to old head (6,1)\n\n- Segment 2: moves to old segment 1 position (5,1)\n\n- Segment 3: moves to old segment 2 position (4,1)  // since segment 2 was at (4,1) before? No.\n\nOld positions: seg0: (6,1), seg1: (5,1), seg2: (4,1), seg3: (4,2), seg4: (4,3), seg5: (4,4), seg6: (4,5), seg7: (3,5), seg8: (2,5), seg9: (2,4)\n\nAfter move:\n\n- New seg0 (head): (6,2)\n\n- New seg1: old seg0 position (6,1)\n\n- New seg2: old seg1 position (5,1)\n\n- New seg3: old seg2 position (4,1)\n\n- New seg4: old seg3 position (4,2)  // old seg3 was (4,2)\n\n- New seg5: old seg4 position (4,3)  // old seg4 was (4,3)\n\n- New seg6: old seg5 position (4,4)  // old seg5 was (4,4)\n\n- New seg7: old seg6 position (4,5)  // old seg6 was (4,5)\n\n- New seg8: old seg7 position (3,5)  // old seg7 was (3,5)\n\n- New seg9: old seg8 position (2,5)  // old seg8 was (2,5)\n\nAnd the old tail position (2,4) is now empty.\n\nSo new snake positions: head (6,2), then (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nTail is now at (2,5), since old tail moved to (2,5).\n\nOld seg9 was at (2,4), but after move, new seg9 is at old seg8 position (2,5), so (2,4) is free.\n\nNow, head at (6,2), direction was R, but now moving up, so new head direction is U.\n\nFor turn 37, I must move to (6,2), so action is U.\n\nBut I need to plan multiple turns.\n\nAfter turn 37, head at (6,2), direction U.\n\nNow turn 38.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut no instant reverse: current direction U, so cannot move D (down) on next turn.\n\nAlso, check surroundings.\n\nHead at (6,2)\n\n- Up: (6,3)\n\n- Down: (6,1) but that's where the body is? New positions: (6,2) head, (6,1) is body segment, seg1.\n\n(6,1) is occupied by body, not tail. Tail is at (2,5). So moving down to (6,1) would be collision.\n\n- Left: (5,2)\n\n- Right: (7,2) but x=7 wall, invalid.\n\n- Up: (6,3) might be free.\n\n- Down: (6,1) body, collision.\n\nSo possible moves: Up to (6,3) or Left to (5,2).\n\n(5,2) is not in snake positions, not wall, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) should be free.\n\nNow, food: (2,6) is at y=6, x=2, and (5,4) at x=5,y=4.\n\n(2,6) has life span 2 at turn 37, so at turn 38, life span decreases to 1, still there, but after turn 38, it disappears if not eaten.\n\nAt turn 37, life span 2; after turn 37, it decreases to 1; can be eaten on turn 38; after turn 38, decreases to 0 and disappears.\n\nSimilarly for (5,4), life span 10, so plenty of time.\n\nBut I need to think about getting to the food.\n\nAlso, there might be a risk with the tail.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (5,4) is on the body? Current positions: (5,4) is not in the list. Snake has (4,4), (4,5), etc., but (5,4) is not occupied, so food is there.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) is not occupied.\n\nBut food can be under body, but in this case, no food under body now.\n\nAfter move to (6,2), positions don't include (5,4) or (2,6).\n\n(5,4) is food location, not occupied by snake.\n\nNow, for turn 38, I can move to (6,3) or (5,2).\n\nI need to think about the food at (2,6) which is about to disappear soon. Life span 1 at turn 38, so I can eat it on turn 38 or it's gone.\n\nBut (2,6) is far from (6,2). Distance: from (6,2) to (2,6) is |6-2|=4 in x, |2-6|=4 in y, so Manhattan distance 8, which is far. With one move, I can only go to adjacent, so I can't reach it in one turn. Turn 38 is the last chance to eat it, but I'm at (6,2), and (2,6) is at distance 8, impossible to reach in one move. So I cannot eat (2,6) on turn 38; it will disappear after turn 38.\n\nTherefore, the food at (2,6) is not reachable in time; I should ignore it.\n\nNow, focus on the other food at (5,4).\n\n(5,4) is closer. From (6,2), it's at (5,4), which is left and up? x: 6 to 5 is left, y:2 to 4 is up, so two moves away: for example, left to (5,2) then up to (5,3) or something, but need to get to (5,4).\n\n(5,4) is at x=5,y=4.\n\nFrom (6,2), I can go left to (5,2), then from there to (5,3) or (5,4) if possible, but (5,4) is at y=4, so from (5,2) to (5,4) is not adjacent; I need to move up twice or something.\n\nManhattan distance: |6-5| + |2-4| = 1 + 2 = 3, so at least 3 moves away.\n\nBut I have multiple turns.\n\nNow, life span is 10, so no rush.\n\nBut I need to plan the path carefully because of the body and walls.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (4,6), but that might not be in the way immediately.\n\nNow, back to turn 37: I must move to (6,2), so action U.\n\nThen turn 38, from (6,2), I can move U to (6,3) or L to (5,2).\n\nIf I move U to (6,3), head at (6,3), direction U.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (6,4), D to (6,2) but that might be body, or L to (5,3), R to (7,3) wall.\n\nAfter moving to (6,3), positions: head (6,3), body: seg1 to (6,2), seg2 to (6,1), etc. (6,2) is now body, so moving down to (6,2) would be collision.\n\nSo from (6,3), can move U to (6,4), L to (5,3), or R to (7,3) wall, invalid. Cannot move D because of no reverse or collision.\n\nCurrent direction U, so cannot move D (reverse).\n\nPossible: U or L.\n\n(6,4) might be free, (5,3) might be free.\n\nIf I move L to (5,2) on turn 38 from (6,2).\n\nTurn 38, head at (6,2), move L to (5,2).\n\nThen head at (5,2), direction L (since moving left).\n\nThen positions: head (5,2), body: seg1 to (6,2), seg2 to (6,1), seg3 to (5,1), etc.\n\nFrom (5,2), possible moves for next turn.\n\nBut let's think about getting to (5,4).\n\n(5,4) is at same x, y=4, so from (5,2), I need to move up to (5,3), then to (5,4).\n\nBut (5,3) and (5,4) need to be free.\n\nCurrently, after turn 37, positions: let's list occupied cells after turn 37 move.\n\nAfter turn 37: head (6,2), body: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nSo occupied: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nFood at (5,4) is not occupied, so I can eat it if I move there.\n\n(5,4) is at x=5,y=4, which is not in the occupied list above, so it's free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) is not occupied, should be free.\n\nNow, from current head at (6,2), to reach (5,4):\n\n- One way: move left to (5,2), then up to (5,3), then up to (5,4). That would take two moves after turn 38? Turn 37: move to (6,2)\n\nThen turn 38: move to (5,2) — that's one move, head at (5,2)\n\nThen turn 39: move up to (5,3)\n\nThen turn 40: move up to (5,4) and eat.\n\nBut on turn 40, I can eat if I move to (5,4).\n\nBut I need to make sure that when I move to (5,4), it's safe.\n\nAlso, the body might be there or not.\n\nAfter turn 37, positions include (4,4), which is near (5,4), but not the same.\n\n(4,4) is occupied, (5,4) is food.\n\nWhen I move to (5,4), if it's not occupied, I can eat it.\n\nBut I need to consider the path.\n\nAnother thing: the tail is at (2,5), and as the snake moves, the tail moves, so cells might free up.\n\nIn this case, since I'm moving towards (5,4), and the body is mostly in the (4,y) column, it might be okay.\n\nBut let's simulate the moves.\n\nFirst, for turn 37, only choice is U to (6,2). Action: U\n\nThen turn 38, from (6,2), I can go to (6,3) or (5,2).\n\nIf I go to (5,2), that gets me closer to (5,4).\n\nIf I go to (6,3), I'm moving away.\n\nSo better to go left to (5,2) on turn 38.\n\nThen on turn 39, from (5,2), I can go up to (5,3), since direction is L (after moving left), so I can move U, D, or L, but not R (reverse).\n\nFrom (5,2), after moving L to (5,2) on turn 38, head at (5,2), direction L.\n\nThen turn 39, possible moves: U to (5,3), D to (5,1), L to (4,2), or R to (6,2) but reverse not allowed? Current direction L, opposite is R, so cannot move R on next turn.\n\nAlso, D to (5,1): what is at (5,1)? After turn 38, if I moved to (5,2) on turn 38, let's see positions.\n\nAfter turn 37: head (6,2), body (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nNow turn 38, move L to (5,2):\n\n- Head moves to (5,2)\n\n- Body: seg1 moves to old head (6,2) — so (6,2) becomes body\n\n- Seg2 moves to old seg1 position (6,1)\n\n- Seg3 moves to old seg2 position (5,1)  // old seg2 was (4,1)? Positions: old seg1 was (6,1), old seg2 was (5,1), etc.\n\nOld positions turn 37: seg0: (6,2), seg1: (6,1), seg2: (5,1), seg3: (4,1), seg4: (4,2), seg5: (4,3), seg6: (4,4), seg7: (4,5), seg8: (3,5), seg9: (2,5)\n\nAfter move to (5,2):\n\n- New head: (5,2)\n\n- New seg1: old seg0 position (6,2)\n\n- New seg2: old seg1 position (6,1)\n\n- New seg3: old seg2 position (5,1)\n\n- New seg4: old seg3 position (4,1)\n\n- New seg5: old seg4 position (4,2)\n\n- New seg6: old seg5 position (4,3)\n\n- New seg7: old seg6 position (4,4)\n\n- New seg8: old seg7 position (4,5)\n\n- New seg9: old seg8 position (3,5)\n\nOld seg8 was (3,5), new seg9 to (3,5), and old tail (2,5) is now free.\n\nSo new positions: head (5,2), body: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)\n\nTail at (3,5)\n\nNow head at (5,2), direction L.\n\nFor turn 39, possible moves:\n\n- U to (5,3)\n\n- D to (5,1) — but (5,1) is occupied by new seg3, which is body, not tail. So moving to (5,1) would cause collision.\n\n- L to (4,2) — (4,2) is occupied by new seg5? New positions: (4,2) is seg5, body, not tail.\n\n- R to (6,2) — but (6,2) is occupied by seg1, body, and also, cannot move R because it's reverse direction? Current direction L, opposite is R, so cannot move R on next turn.\n\nAlso, moving to (6,2) is occupied, collision.\n\nNow, U to (5,3): is (5,3) occupied? Not in positions, not wall, so free.\n\nL to (4,2): (4,2) is occupied by seg5, body, so collision if move there.\n\nD to (5,1): occupied, collision.\n\nR: invalid reverse and occupied.\n\nSo only possible move is U to (5,3).\n\nThen after moving U to (5,3), head at (5,3), direction U.\n\nPositions: head (5,3), seg1 to old head (5,2), seg2 to (6,2), seg3 to (6,1), etc.\n\nNow turn 40, from (5,3), I can move to (5,4) to eat the food.\n\nMove U to (5,4).\n\n(5,4) has food, value +1, so eating it increases length.\n\nWhen I move to a food cell, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (5,4) on turn 40, I eat the food, so the length increases, and the tail stays where it is for that turn.\n\nSpecifically, when head moves to food cell, the head occupies it, and a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail doesn't move; the snake grows by one.\n\nBut in terms of collision, when moving to (5,4), it must be free except if it's the tail, but here it's food, so should be fine.\n\nAfter turn 39 positions: let's list.\n\nAfter turn 38: head (5,2), body (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)\n\nTurn 39, move U to (5,3):\n\n- Head to (5,3)\n\n- Seg1 to old head (5,2)\n\n- Seg2 to old seg1 (6,2)\n\n- Seg3 to old seg2 (6,1)\n\n- Seg4 to old seg3 (5,1)\n\n- Seg5 to old seg4 (4,1)\n\n- Seg6 to old seg5 (4,2)\n\n- Seg7 to old seg6 (4,3)\n\n- Seg8 to old seg7 (4,4)\n\n- Seg9 to old seg8 (4,5)\n\nOld seg8 was (4,5), new seg9 to (4,5), and old tail (3,5) is free? Old positions turn 38: seg9 was (3,5), so after move, new seg9 to old seg8 position (4,5), so (3,5) is free.\n\nNew positions: head (5,3), body: (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nNow turn 40, move U to (5,4):\n\n- Head moves to (5,4), which has food, so snake grows.\n\nAfter eating, head is at (5,4), and a new segment is added, so the body doesn't move; the tail stays, but since it grows, the new position is head at (5,4), and the previous segments remain, with a new segment added at the tail position? No.\n\nStandard Snake: when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail does not move; so the snake grows by one cell.\n\nIn terms of positions: the head moves to the new cell, and the body segments stay where they are, but since the tail doesn't move, the length increases.\n\nFor example, before move, positions: head (5,3), body segments down to tail.\n\nAfter moving head to (5,4) with food, new head at (5,4), and the body segments: the first body segment is still at (5,3), but now it's connected, so the positions are: head (5,4), then the previous head (5,3) becomes the new first body segment, and all other body segments remain, with no movement.\n\nSince the tail doesn't move, the snake has one more segment.\n\nIn this case, before turn 40 move, positions: seg0: (5,3) head, seg1: (5,2), seg2: (6,2), ..., up to seg9: (4,5) I think.\n\nList: turn 39 positions: seg0: (5,3), seg1: (5,2), seg2: (6,2), seg3: (6,1), seg4: (5,1), seg5: (4,1), seg6: (4,2), seg7: (4,3), seg8: (4,4), seg9: (4,5)\n\nNow, move head to (5,4), which has food.\n\nSince food is eaten, the head moves to (5,4), and no body segments move; the tail stays. So the new positions are: head (5,4), then seg1: (5,3), seg2: (5,2), seg3: (6,2), seg4: (6,1), seg5: (5,1), seg6: (4,1), seg7: (4,2), seg8: (4,3), seg9: (4,4), and a new segment added at the end, which is the old tail position or something? No.\n\nWhen eating, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added to the tail. So the tail position remains, and a new segment is created there, but since the tail didn't move, it's extended.\n\nPositions: the new head is at the food cell (5,4), the previous head position (5,3) becomes the first body segment, and all previous body segments remain, with an additional segment at the tail end.\n\nSo from above, after eating:\n\n- Head: (5,4)\n\n- Body seg1: (5,3)  // previous head\n\n- Body seg2: (5,2)  // previous seg1\n\n- Body seg3: (6,2)  // previous seg2\n\n- Body seg4: (6,1)  // previous seg3\n\n- Body seg5: (5,1)  // previous seg4\n\n- Body seg6: (4,1)  // previous seg5\n\n- Body seg7: (4,2)  // previous seg6\n\n- Body seg8: (4,3)  // previous seg7\n\n- Body seg9: (4,4)  // previous seg8\n\n- Body seg10: (4,5)  // previous seg9, and since eating, a new segment is added, so seg10 at (4,5)\n\nPrevious seg9 was (4,5), and it stays there, so it becomes seg10.\n\nThe snake grows, so there are 11 segments now.\n\nBut for collision, it should be fine.\n\nNow, back to the plan.\n\nSo for turn 40, I move to (5,4) and eat, getting +1 score.\n\nBut I need to think about after that.\n\nIn this path, I assumed on turn 38 I move left to (5,2).\n\nBut on turn 38, I could have moved up to (6,3) instead.\n\nBut that might not be efficient for getting the food.\n\nSince I have to think 5 turns ahead, let's outline the turns.\n\nTurn 37: must move U to (6,2)\n\nTurn 38: I can move to (5,2) or (6,3)\n\nIf I move to (5,2), then turn 39: must move U to (5,3) (only choice? From (5,2), only U is safe, as we saw)\n\nThen turn 40: move U to (5,4) and eat.\n\nNow, after eating, head at (5,4), direction U.\n\nThen I need to move somewhere.\n\nBut let's see the state after eating.\n\nAlso, there might be risks.\n\nAnother thing: the tail reward danger.\n\nIf head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because of collision.\n\nBut in this case, the food is at (5,4), which is not near the tail; tail is at (4,5) or something.\n\nAfter eating, positions: head (5,4), then (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nTail at (4,5)\n\nHead at (5,4), tail at (4,5), which are adjacent diagonally? (5,4) and (4,5) are not adjacent; adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n\nSo (5,4) and (4,5) are not adjacent; they are diagonal, so no shared edge. Adjacent cells are (4,4), (5,5), (6,4), (5,3) etc. for (5,4).\n\nSo tail at (4,5) is not adjacent to head at (5,4), so no issue.\n\nNow, after turn 40, head at (5,4), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut no instant reverse: current U, so cannot move D.\n\nAlso, surroundings:\n\n- U to (5,5)\n\n- D to (5,3) but that's body, seg1 at (5,3), so collision\n\n- L to (4,4) — (4,4) is occupied by seg9? Positions: seg1: (5,3), seg2: (5,2), ..., seg9: (4,4)? After eating, seg1 to seg10.\n\nList indices: head (5,4), seg1: (5,3), seg2: (5,2), seg3: (6,2), seg4: (6,1), seg5: (5,1), seg6: (4,1), seg7: (4,2), seg8: (4,3), seg9: (4,4), seg10: (4,5)\n\nSo (4,4) is seg9, body.\n\n(5,3) is seg1, body.\n\n(5,5) might be free.\n\n(6,4) might be free.\n\n(4,4) is body.\n\nSo from (5,4):\n\n- U to (5,5) — if free\n\n- D to (5,3) — occupied by seg1, collision\n\n- L to (4,4) — occupied by seg9, collision\n\n- R to (6,4) — if free\n\nCannot move D or L due to collision and possibly reverse, but D is reverse, which is also invalid.\n\nCurrent direction U, so cannot move D (reverse).\n\nPossible: U to (5,5) or R to (6,4)\n\n(5,5) and (6,4) should be free, assuming no walls or food.\n\nWalls: borders, so (5,5) is x=5,y=5, within bounds.\n\n(6,4) similarly.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), not relevant.\n\nSo I can move U or R.\n\nBut I need to survive and find more food, but currently only one food, which I just ate, so no other food present? The other food at (2,6) disappeared after turn 38.\n\nAfter eating (5,4), it might respawn or something, but not specified. I think food is given, and after eating, it's gone, and new may appear, but not in the state, so I have to assume only the given food.\n\nBut the state has two foods, but (2,6) disappears soon.\n\nIn this plan, by turn 40 I eat (5,4).\n\nBut on turn 37, I must move U.\n\nThen turn 38, if I move L to (5,2), then turn 39 U to (5,3), turn 40 U to (5,4).\n\nBut is there a problem?\n\nOn turn 39, when I move to (5,3), is that safe? From turn 38 positions: after turn 38 move to (5,2), positions: head (5,2), body (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)\n\nThen move U to (5,3): (5,3) is free, so okay.\n\nThen to (5,4).\n\nBut after eating, I have to move away.\n\nNow, what if on turn 38 I move to (6,3) instead?\n\nFrom (6,2), move U to (6,3).\n\nThen head at (6,3), direction U.\n\nThen turn 39, from (6,3), I can move U to (6,4) or L to (5,3) (since cannot move D or R? R to (7,3) wall, D to (6,2) body or reverse).\n\nAfter move to (6,3), positions: similar to before, head (6,3), body (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), etc.\n\n(6,2) is body, so cannot move D.\n\nCan move U to (6,4) or L to (5,3).\n\n(5,3) might be free.\n\nThen from there, to get to (5,4), I need to move left to (5,3) if not already, then to (5,4).\n\nBut from (6,3), if I move L to (5,3) on turn 39, then turn 40 move to (5,4).\n\nBut that also takes to turn 40 to eat.\n\nCompared to moving directly left on turn 38, which gets me to (5,2) and then to (5,4) faster? With left move, on turn 38 to (5,2), turn 39 to (5,3), turn 40 to (5,4).\n\nWith up move, turn 38 to (6,3), turn 39 to (5,3) or (6,4), then to (5,4) on turn 40 if I go to (5,3) first.\n\nIf I go to (6,4) on turn 39, then from (6,4) to (5,4) is left, which might be possible on turn 40.\n\nBut (5,4) is at (5,4), so from (6,4) to (5,4) is left.\n\nBut in terms of turns, both ways I eat on turn 40, but with the left path, I'm closer earlier, but same eating turn.\n\nBut with the up path, I might be in a worse position after eating.\n\nFor example, if I go to (6,3) on turn 38, then to (6,4) on turn 39, then to (5,4) on turn 40.\n\nAfter eating at (5,4), head at (5,4), direction from moving left, so L.\n\nThen positions similar.\n\nBut in the first path, when I eat from (5,3) to (5,4), direction U, and after eating, I can move U to (5,5) or R to (6,4).\n\nIf I come from left, say from (5,3) to (5,4), same.\n\nBut if I come from (6,4) to (5,4), direction L, then after eating, head at (5,4), direction L, so I can move U, D, L, R but not R (reverse? Opposite is R, current L, so cannot move R).\n\nCurrent direction L, so cannot move R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,5), D to (5,3), L to (4,4), R to (6,4) but reverse not allowed.\n\nBut (5,3) might be body, (4,4) might be body, etc.\n\nSimilar constraints.\n\nBut to avoid unnecessary risk, the direct path to the food might be better.\n\nMoreover, in the first path, when I move to (5,2) on turn 38, I need to ensure that (5,2) is safe, which it is.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (4,6), but not in the way.\n\nAlso, after eating, I need to find a way to survive, but since no other food, I should just move safely.\n\nBut the food at (5,4) has life span 10, so I have time, but since I can eat it by turn 40, and it's positive, I should eat it.\n\nBut is there a reason to delay? Probably not.\n\nNow, back to turn 37: I must move U.\n\nThen for turn 38, moving L to (5,2) seems good to approach the food.\n\nBut let's confirm if on turn 38 from (6,2), moving to (5,2) is safe.\n\n(5,2) is free, as per earlier.\n\nAfter turn 37 move, positions: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\n(5,2) not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) not occupied.\n\nBut moving to (5,2) gets me closer.\n\nPerhaps I should think 5 turns ahead as per instruction.\n\nTurn 37: move U to (6,2)  // only choice\n\nThen turn 38: move L to (5,2)  // to approach food\n\nTurn 39: move U to (5,3)  // only choice, as D, L, R not possible or collision\n\nFrom (5,2), after move to (5,2), only U is possible, as we saw.\n\nThen turn 40: move U to (5,4) and eat.\n\nThen after that, turn 41: from (5,4), direction U, I can move U to (5,5) or R to (6,4), since D and L not possible.\n\n(5,5) and (6,4) should be free.\n\nNow, to maximize survival, I should choose a move that keeps options open.\n\nFor example, move to (5,5) or (6,4).\n\n(5,5) is up, (6,4) is right.\n\nThe grid has walls, and internal obstacle.\n\n(4,6) is obstacle, so (5,5) might be near it.\n\nBut y=7 is wall, so (5,5) to (5,6) or something, but not immediate.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) to (6,5) etc.\n\nBut since no food, I just need to avoid dead ends.\n\nFor now, with the plan, I can eat the food safely.\n\nBut what about the other food? (2,6) is not reachable, so forget it.\n\nNow, in the state, is there any danger I missed?\n\nThe tail at (2,5) initially, but after moves, it moves away.\n\nIn the path, when I move, for example, on turn 39 to (5,3), the body is around, but since I'm moving to free cells, should be fine.\n\nAnother point: the food at (5,4) might be under the body? But currently not, and in the positions, it's not occupied.\n\nBut food can spawn under body, but in this case, it's not, so I can eat it.\n\nSo the plan seems solid.\n\nTherefore, for the answer:\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: L\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U  // to eat\n\nBut I need to output for 5 turns or more? The instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but the answer format is to list actions starting from current turn.\n\nIn the box, list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nSince t1=37, I need to list for 37,38,39,... but how many? Probably at least until I eat or something.\n\nBut to be safe, I can list for 5 turns: 37 to 41 or 42.\n\nBut after eating, I need to move, but it might be arbitrary.\n\nSince the food is eaten on turn 40, and for survival, I can choose moves.\n\nBut in the answer, I need to specify the actions.\n\nPerhaps list until turn 41 or so.\n\nSince thinking ahead, but output the immediate actions.\n\nThe format says to list actions for multiple turns starting from t1.\n\nFor example, \"Turn 37: action, Turn 38: action, ...\"\n\nI should list for the next few turns where I have a plan.\n\nFor turn 41, I can choose U or R, but I need to decide.\n\nTo be precise, let's define the moves up to turn 40, and for turn 41, I can suggest one.\n\nBut since the AI should maximize score, and no more food, survival is key.\n\nAfter eating, head at (5,4), direction U.\n\nI can move U to (5,5) or R to (6,4).\n\n(5,5) is at y=5, and above is (5,6), (5,7) wall.\n\n(6,4) has more space.\n\nBut also, the body is below and left.\n\nAfter eating, positions: head (5,4), body (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nSo the area around: (5,5) is free, (6,4) free, (4,4) is body, (5,3) body, etc.\n\nIf I move U to (5,5), then from there, I can move U to (5,6), L to (4,5) but (4,5) is body? (4,5) is seg10, body, so cannot move left to (4,4) or something, but from (5,5), moves: U to (5,6), D to (5,4) but that's head or body? (5,4) is head, but after move, it would be body if I move away, but when moving, head moves to new cell.\n\nFrom (5,5): U to (5,6), D to (5,4) but (5,4) is occupied by body seg1 after head moves? Let's not complicate.\n\nTo have more space, moving R to (6,4) might be better, since the right side has fewer body segments.\n\n(6,4) is free, and from there, I can go to (6,5), (7,4) wall, (5,4) body, (6,3) might be free or not.\n\nAfter moving to (6,4), positions change.\n\nBut for now, in the plan, I can choose to move R on turn 41.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence.\n\nBut since the instruction is to think ahead, I should include the moves.\n\nPerhaps for the answer, list from turn 37 to 41.\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: L\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U  // eat\n\nTurn 41: R  // for example, to (6,4)\n\nBut I need to make sure that on turn 41, moving R is possible.\n\nAfter turn 40 eat, head at (5,4), direction U (since moved up to eat).\n\nThen for turn 41, current direction U, so cannot move D.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,5), R to (6,4), L to (4,4) but (4,4) is body, collision, D invalid reverse.\n\nSo U or R.\n\nI choose R to (6,4) to go to a less crowded area.\n\n(5,5) might lead to a corner, but (5,5) to (5,6), then to (5,7) wall, so might be tight.\n\nWhereas (6,4) to (6,5), (6,6), etc., more space.\n\nAlso, (7,4) is wall, but y can go up.\n\nSo R seems better.\n\nTherefore, the actions:\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: L\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: R\n\nBut for turn 39, is moving U the only choice? Earlier I thought so, but let's confirm.\n\nOn turn 38, after moving to (5,2), positions: head (5,2), body (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)\n\nFor turn 39, from (5,2), moves:\n\n- U to (5,3): free, as (5,3) not occupied\n\n- D to (5,1): occupied by body (seg4? seg4 is (5,1), body, so collision\n\n- L to (4,2): occupied by seg6? seg6 is (4,2), body, collision\n\n- R to (6,2): occupied by seg1 ( (6,2) ), and also reverse, since current direction L, opposite R, so invalid\n\nSo only U possible, yes.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nNow, about the food life span: (5,4) has life span 10, and I eat on turn 40, which is 3 turns after t1=37, so turn 40 is t1+3, life span was 10 at turn 37, decreases each turn, so at turn 40, life span 10-3=7, still plenty, so no issue.\n\n(2,6) disappears after turn 38, not reachable.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, the AI must plan at least 5 turns ahead, prioritizing safe paths to the positive food at (5,4) while avoiding collisions and dead ends. The food at (2,6) has a life span of 2 at turn 37, meaning it disappears after turn 38 and is unreachable from the starting position (6,1) in time, so it is ignored. The food at (5,4) has a life span of 10, allowing ample time to reach it safely.\n\n### Key Constraints and Risks:\n- **Current Turn (37) Movement**: The snake head is at (6,1) with direction R (right). Possible moves are U (up), D (down), L (left), or R (right), but:\n  - R to (7,1) is a wall (x=7 border).\n  - D to (6,0) is a wall (y=0 border).\n  - L to (5,1) is occupied by a body segment (not the tail), causing collision.\n  - Only U to (6,2) is safe.\n- **No Instant Reverse**: After moving U on turn 37, the new direction is U, so D (down) cannot be chosen on turn 38.\n- **Food Access**: The food at (5,4) must be eaten without the head being adjacent to the tail when eating, but the tail is distant, so no risk.\n- **Collision Avoidance**: Movements must avoid walls, body segments (except the tail), and internal obstacles (e.g., (4,6)).\n- **Path to Food**: From (6,2) after turn 37, the optimal path to (5,4) is via (5,2) and (5,3), reaching the food on turn 40.\n\n### 5-Turn Plan:\n1. **Turn 37 (Current Turn)**: Move U to (6,2) – Only safe move; avoids walls and body collision.\n2. **Turn 38**: Move L to (5,2) – Moves closer to food; direction changes to L (left). U and L are possible, but L is chosen for efficiency. Moving U would delay the food approach.\n3. **Turn 39**: Move U to (5,3) – Only safe move; direction changes to U (up). D is reverse (invalid), L and R lead to body collisions.\n4. **Turn 40**: Move U to (5,4) – Eats positive food (+1 score, length increases). Safe as (5,4) is free and not adjacent to tail.\n5. **Turn 41**: Move R to (6,4) – After eating, head at (5,4) with direction U. U to (5,5) and R to (6,4) are possible, but R is chosen to avoid the crowded left side and access more open space for future moves. L to (4,4) causes collision, D is reverse (invalid).\n\n### Why This Plan?\n- **Score Maximization**: Eats the +1 food on turn 40 safely. The other food is ignored as unreachable.\n- **Risk Minimization**: All moves avoid collisions:\n  - Turn 37: U is only option.\n  - Turn 38: L is safe and efficient; U to (6,3) is possible but less direct.\n  - Turn 39: U is only option due to body constraints.\n  - Turn 40: U eats food without tail risk.\n  - Turn 41: R ensures movement into open area, reducing entrapment risk.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: After turn 41, the snake has more space (e.g., can move to (6,5) or (7,4) but x=7 wall) for future exploration. The internal obstacle (4,6) is avoided.\n\n### State After Key Moves:\n- **After Turn 37 (head (6,2))**: Positions: [(6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)].\n- **After Turn 38 (head (5,2))**: Positions: [(5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)].\n- **After Turn 39 (head (5,3))**: Positions: [(5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)].\n- **After Turn 40 (eat at (5,4))**: Positions: [(5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)] (length 11).\n- **After Turn 41 (head (6,4))**: Positions: [(6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)].\n\nThis plan secures the food and positions the snake for continued survival.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 37: U\nTurn 38: L\nTurn 39: U\nTurn 40: U\nTurn 41: R\n}",

        "step": 38,
        "score": 9,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 38, and I'm playing Snake on a grid with walls and obstacles.\n\nThe grid has borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, since walls occupy the borders. Internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (6,2), then body segments: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5). So the snake is 10 segments long. Head direction is Up, meaning it was moving upwards to reach (6,2) from (6,1), I assume.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (2,6) with value 1 and life span 1. Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 38, it has life span 1, meaning it will disappear after this turn if not eaten. Since life span decreases on the turn it's present, if not eaten on turn 38, it vanishes.\n\nLife span: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at (2,6) with life span 1 on turn 38, if not eaten on turn 38, it's gone.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) with value 1 and life span 9. Value is 1 for both, so positive food. Value 1 means +1 point and snake grows by one segment when eaten.\n\nNow, I need to choose actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns. But the answer format should show actions starting from turn 38 onwards.\n\nSnake head is at (6,2) and direction is Up. So from (6,2), moving Up would go to (6,3), but let's see possible moves.\n\nCurrent head position: (6,2)\n\nPossible moves: U (up) to (6,3), D (down) to (6,1), but (6,1) is occupied by the body, so that would be a collision. L (left) to (5,2), R (right) but x=7 is wall, so R to (7,2) is invalid since x=7 is wall.\n\nGrid: x from 0 to 7, walls at x=0 and x=7, so playable x=1 to 6. Similarly y=0 and y=7 walls, playable y=1 to 6.\n\nSo (6,2): possible moves:\n\n- U: (6,3) - y=3, which is within 1-6\n\n- D: (6,1) - but (6,1) is the second segment of the snake? Snake positions: head (6,2), then (6,1), (5,1), etc. So (6,1) is directly below the head, occupied by body.\n\nMoving to a body segment is deadly unless it's the tail and the tail moves away, but in this case, (6,1) is not the tail; tail is at (2,5).\n\nBody collision: \"head touches any body segment\" is deadly. But there's an exception: you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment only if the tail moves away at the same time, so no collision.\n\nStandard snake: when head moves to a new cell, and tail moves, so if head moves to where tail was, and tail moves, it's ok.\n\nHere: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, for (6,1), it is the second segment, not the tail. Tail is at (2,5). So moving to (6,1) would be collision with body.\n\nSimilarly, D to (6,1) is invalid.\n\nL to (5,2) - is (5,2) occupied? Snake positions: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5). So (5,2) is not listed, so should be free, assuming no other obstacles.\n\nR to (7,2) but x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n\nU to (6,3) - free? Not listed, so probably free.\n\nAlso, no instant reverse: current direction is U, so I cannot move D immediately, which is opposite. But D is invalid anyway.\n\nSo possible actions: U or L.\n\nU: (6,3)\n\nL: (5,2)\n\nNow, food: (2,6) with life span 1, so must be eaten now or it's gone. But (2,6) is far away. Head at (6,2), food at (2,6). Distance: |6-2|=4 in x, |2-6|=4 in y, so Manhattan distance 8, impossible to reach in one turn. So cannot eat it this turn. Since life span 1, it will disappear after this turn, so it's gone forever. No point considering it.\n\nOther food: (5,4) with value 1, life span 9. So it will last until turn 38 + 9 - 1? Life span: at turn 38, life span 9, meaning it has 9 turns left, including turn 38. After turn 38, life span becomes 8, and so on, until it reaches 0 and disappears.\n\n\"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so for food with life span N on turn t, it disappears after turn t + N - 1? Let's clarify.\n\nSuppose food appears at turn t with life span N. On turn t, life span N, decreases to N-1 at end of turn or during?\n\nThe rule: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nI think it means: at the start of turn, if food has life span L, it can be eaten during that turn. After the turn, L decreases by 1. If L becomes 0 after decrease, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly here: at turn 38, food (2,6) has life span 1, so it can be eaten on turn 38. After turn 38, life span decreases to 0, disappears.\n\nFood (5,4) has life span 9 on turn 38, so it can be eaten from turn 38 to turn 38 + 8 = 46? Let's calculate.\n\nIf life span is L at turn t:\n\n- On turn t, it is present with life span L.\n\n- After turn t, life span becomes L-1.\n\n- So it disappears after turn t + L - 1, when life span becomes 0.\n\nFor (2,6): life span 1 on turn 38, disappears after turn 38 (since after turn 38, life span 0).\n\nFor (5,4): life span 9 on turn 38, so it will be present until turn 38 + 8 = 46? On turn 38: L=9, after turn L=8; turn 39: L=8, after turn L=7; ... turn 46: L=1, after turn L=0, disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 38 to 46 inclusive.\n\nBut on turn 46, L=1, eaten or not, after turn it disappears.\n\nNow, back to possible moves.\n\nFrom (6,2), I can move U to (6,3) or L to (5,2).\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. Walls at borders, and internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is at y=6, which is border? y=7 is wall, y=6 is playable? Walls: border cells x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. So y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to y=6 are free, except obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle: (4,6), so (4,6) is blocked.\n\nSimilarly, x=0 and x=7 walls, x=1 to 6 free except obstacles.\n\nSnake positions: list all occupied cells.\n\nHead: (6,2)\n\nBody: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) — that's 9 body segments, plus head, total 10 segments.\n\nPositions: [(6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nSo occupied: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nFood: (2,6) and (5,4)\n\n(2,6) will disappear after this turn, so ignore.\n\n(5,4) is at (5,4), which is not occupied, so it's available.\n\nNow, from head (6,2), move options:\n\n- U to (6,3): is (6,3) free? Not occupied, no wall, so yes.\n\n- L to (5,2): (5,2) — is it occupied? From positions, (5,1) is occupied, but (5,2) not listed, so free.\n\n(5,2) should be free.\n\nD and R invalid, as before.\n\nNow, I need to plan to eat the food at (5,4) if possible, or survive long term.\n\nAlso, avoid risks.\n\nFirst, let's see if I can reach (5,4) soon.\n\n(5,4) is at x=5,y=4.\n\nHead at (6,2), so need to go left and up.\n\nPossible paths.\n\nIf I move L to (5,2) this turn.\n\nThen head to (5,2), direction was U, but after move, direction changes.\n\nAfter moving, the new head direction is the move I make.\n\nSnake head direction will be set to the move direction after each action.\n\nCurrent direction U, I move L, then new direction L.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, from (5,2), possible moves: U to (5,3), D to (5,1) but (5,1) is occupied by body, so invalid, L to (4,2) but (4,2) is occupied, body segment, invalid, R to (6,2) but (6,2) is where head was, but now tail might have moved? When head moves to (5,2), the tail moves from (2,5) to... let's see snake movement.\n\nWhen snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail is removed.\n\nSo after moving to (5,2):\n\nNew positions: head (5,2), then previous head (6,2) becomes body, so (6,2), then (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2)? Let's list carefully.\n\nCurrent positions: index 0: head (6,2), 1: (6,1), 2: (5,1), 3: (4,1), 4: (4,2), 5: (4,3), 6: (4,4), 7: (4,5), 8: (3,5), 9: tail (2,5)\n\nAfter moving head to (5,2):\n\nNew head: (5,2)\n\nThen body: the previous positions from 0 to 8, but shifted.\n\nSegment 1 (old body) moves to where head was, (6,2)? No.\n\nStandard: the new body is the previous head position, and so on.\n\nAfter move:\n\n- New head: (5,2)\n\n- New body segment 1: old head position (6,2)\n\n- New body segment 2: old body segment 1 position (6,1)\n\n- New body segment 3: old body segment 2 position (5,1)\n\n- New body segment 4: old body segment 3 position (4,1)\n\n- New body segment 5: old body segment 4 position (4,2)\n\n- New body segment 6: old body segment 5 position (4,3)\n\n- New body segment 7: old body segment 6 position (4,4)\n\n- New body segment 8: old body segment 7 position (4,5)\n\n- New body segment 9: old body segment 8 position (3,5)\n\n- Tail: old body segment 9 position (2,5) is left, so tail moves to where? When head moves, tail is removed only if no food eaten; since no food eaten, tail is removed.\n\nWhen snake moves, if no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the next position, and the tail cell is vacated.\n\nSo new positions: head at new position (5,2)\n\nThen body: [ (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5) ]\n\nOld tail (2,5) is gone.\n\nSo new snake: [(5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)] — 10 segments? Head and 9 body? No.\n\nList: positions after move L to (5,2):\n\n- Head: (5,2)\n\n- Body segments: the previous positions except the tail is removed.\n\nPrevious positions: 0:(6,2) head, 1:(6,1), 2:(5,1), 3:(4,1), 4:(4,2), 5:(4,3), 6:(4,4), 7:(4,5), 8:(3,5), 9:(2,5) tail\n\nAfter move, head to (5,2), so new head (5,2)\n\nThen segment 1: position that was head, (6,2)\n\nSegment 2: position that was body 1, (6,1)\n\nSegment 3: body 2, (5,1)\n\nSegment 4: body 3, (4,1)\n\nSegment 5: body 4, (4,2)\n\nSegment 6: body 5, (4,3)\n\nSegment 7: body 6, (4,4)\n\nSegment 8: body 7, (4,5)\n\nSegment 9: body 8, (3,5)\n\nAnd body 9 (tail) (2,5) is removed, so no longer occupied.\n\nSo new snake: [(5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)] — that's 10 positions, but the tail is now (3,5), which was body 8 before.\n\nLength same, no food eaten.\n\nOccupied: (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)\n\nNow, from here, head at (5,2), direction L (since I moved left).\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,3), D to (5,1) but (5,1) is occupied, invalid, L to (4,2) but (4,2) is occupied, invalid, R to (6,2) but (6,2) is occupied by body, invalid? (6,2) is now a body segment, not tail.\n\n(3,5) is tail.\n\nSo all directions except U are blocked? U to (5,3) might be free.\n\n(5,3) not occupied, no wall, so only U possible.\n\nThen move U to (5,3).\n\nThen head to (5,3), new positions, tail removed, etc.\n\nBut let's not go too deep yet.\n\nIf I move U from (6,2) to (6,3) now.\n\nCurrent turn 38, move U to (6,3).\n\nNew head (6,3)\n\nBody: [ (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5) ] and tail (2,5) removed.\n\nNew snake: [(6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)]\n\nTail at (3,5).\n\nNow, from (6,3), head, direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,4), D to (6,2) but (6,2) is body, invalid (not tail), L to (5,3), R invalid to wall.\n\nSo U or L.\n\n(6,4) and (5,3) both possible.\n\n(5,3) might be free.\n\nNow, food at (5,4), which is near (5,3) or (6,4).\n\nI need to get to (5,4).\n\nAlso, there's a risk with tail: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills snake because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut currently, no food on tail, I think.\n\nTail is at (3,5), no food there.\n\nFood at (2,6) and (5,4), not on tail.\n\n(2,6) disappears after this turn.\n\nSo focus on (5,4).\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should eat the food when possible, but with long-term survival.\n\nFirst, from current position (6,2), if I move L to (5,2), then as before, I might be forced to move U to (5,3), then from (5,3), I can move U to (5,4) to eat food.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nTurn 38: move L to (5,2) — head to (5,2), direction now L.\n\nSnake: [(5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)] tail at (3,5)\n\nNow turn 39: from (5,2), possible moves: U to (5,3), D to (5,1) occupied, L to (4,2) occupied, R to (6,2) occupied, so only U possible. Move U to (5,3).\n\nHead to (5,3), direction U.\n\nNew snake: [(5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)] tail at (4,5)? After move, positions: head (5,3), body: previous head (5,2), then (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), and tail: previous body segment 8 was (4,5)? Let's index.\n\nPrevious before turn 39: positions: 0: (5,2) head, 1: (6,2), 2: (6,1), 3: (5,1), 4: (4,1), 5: (4,2), 6: (4,3), 7: (4,4), 8: (4,5), 9: (3,5) tail\n\nAfter move to (5,3): new head (5,3)\n\nBody: old head (5,2), then old body 1 (6,2), old body 2 (6,1), old body 3 (5,1), old body 4 (4,1), old body 5 (4,2), old body 6 (4,3), old body 7 (4,4), old body 8 (4,5)\n\nTail old body 9 (3,5) removed.\n\nSo new snake: [(5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)] tail at (4,5)\n\nNow head at (5,3), direction U.\n\nFood at (5,4), which is directly above (5,3).\n\nI can move U to (5,4) to eat it.\n\nTurn 40: move U to (5,4).\n\nSince I eat food, snake grows, so tail does not move.\n\nNew head: (5,4)\n\nBody: all previous positions, so snake becomes: head (5,4), then body: (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) — and since food eaten, length increases, so tail stays, new segment added.\n\nWhen food eaten, head moves to food cell, but tail does not move, so snake grows by one segment.\n\nSo positions: new head (5,4), then the previous head and body: (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) — that's 11 segments.\n\nTail is (4,5).\n\nNow, after eating, I have a longer snake.\n\nBut is there any danger? The food was at (5,4), and I ate it.\n\nNow, from (5,4), head, direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,5), D to (5,3) but (5,3) is body, invalid, L to (4,4) but (4,4) is body, invalid, R to (6,4).\n\n(6,4) is free? Not occupied, no wall.\n\nSo U or R.\n\n(5,5) and (6,4).\n\nNow, if I had moved U from (6,2) initially.\n\nTurn 38: move U to (6,3)\n\nHead to (6,3), direction U.\n\nSnake: [(6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)] tail (3,5)\n\nNow turn 39: from (6,3), possible moves U to (6,4), D to (6,2) occupied, L to (5,3), R invalid.\n\nSo U or L.\n\nIf I move L to (5,3), then head to (5,3), direction L.\n\nThen snake: [(5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)] tail (4,5)? Similar to before.\n\nPrevious positions: 0:(6,3) head, 1:(6,2), 2:(6,1), 3:(5,1), 4:(4,1), 5:(4,2), 6:(4,3), 7:(4,4), 8:(4,5), 9:(3,5) tail\n\nAfter move L to (5,3): new head (5,3)\n\nBody: old head (6,3), old body1 (6,2), old body2 (6,1), old body3 (5,1), old body4 (4,1), old body5 (4,2), old body6 (4,3), old body7 (4,4), old body8 (4,5)\n\nTail old body9 (3,5) removed.\n\nSo snake: [(5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)] tail (4,5)\n\nNow head (5,3), direction L.\n\nFood at (5,4), I can move U to (5,4) to eat.\n\nTurn 40: move U to (5,4), eat food.\n\nNew head (5,4), grow, so snake: head (5,4), body (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) — 11 segments, tail (4,5)\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf from (6,3) I moved U to (6,4) on turn 39.\n\nThen head to (6,4), direction U.\n\nSnake: [(6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)] tail (4,5)? After move, tail removed, old tail (3,5) gone.\n\nPositions: new head (6,4), body: old head (6,3), old body1 (6,2), old body2 (6,1), old body3 (5,1), old body4 (4,1), old body5 (4,2), old body6 (4,3), old body7 (4,4), old body8 (4,5) — tail (4,5)\n\nThen from (6,4), I need to get to (5,4). I can move L to (5,4) on turn 40.\n\nTurn 40: move L to (5,4), eat food.\n\nNew head (5,4), grow, snake: head (5,4), body (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) — 11 segments, tail (4,5)\n\nIn all cases, I can eat the food on turn 40, either by going left then up or up then left, but with different paths.\n\nIn the first path (move L then U), I ate on turn 40, similarly in the second if I go U then L.\n\nBut in the U then L case, from (6,3) I could go directly to (5,4) if possible, but from (6,3) to (5,4) is diagonal, not adjacent, must move one step.\n\n(5,4) is adjacent to (5,3) and (6,4), not to (6,3).\n\nFrom (6,3), I can only go to (6,4) or (5,3) or (6,2) but (6,2) occupied.\n\nSo to reach (5,4), I need two moves: either to (5,3) or (6,4) first.\n\nNow, comparing the options:\n\nIf I move L on turn 38 to (5,2), then on turn 39 I must move U to (5,3), then on turn 40 move U to (5,4) to eat.\n\nIf I move U on turn 38 to (6,3), then on turn 39 I can move L to (5,3) or U to (6,4), then on turn 40 I can move to (5,4) to eat.\n\nBut in the first case, when I move L to (5,2) on turn 38, on turn 39 I have only one choice: U to (5,3), no option.\n\nWhereas if I move U to (6,3), on turn 39 I have choices: I can go to (5,3) or to (6,4), both allow me to reach (5,4) on turn 40.\n\nBut after eating, I need to think about survival.\n\nAlso, there might be risks.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is blocked, but y=6 is the top row, since y=7 wall.\n\nPlayable y=1 to 6, so (4,6) is the top row, but blocked by obstacle.\n\nNow, after eating at (5,4), I have a longer snake, and I need to move away.\n\nFrom (5,4), after eating, head at (5,4), direction U (since I moved up to eat).\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,5), D to (5,3) occupied, L to (4,4) occupied, R to (6,4) which might be free.\n\nIn the first scenario, after eating, snake positions: head (5,4), body (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) tail at (4,5)\n\nSo occupied: (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nNow, from (5,4), move U to (5,5): (5,5) free? Not occupied, no wall.\n\nOr R to (6,4): (6,4) free? In this snake, (6,4) not occupied, yes.\n\nBut (6,4) might be free.\n\nIf I move R to (6,4), then head to (6,4), direction R.\n\nThen snake moves, no food, so tail moves.\n\nBut let's see the area.\n\nThe snake is mostly on the left and bottom, but after moving, it's spreading.\n\nTo survive long term, I need to avoid boxing myself in.\n\nAnother food might spawn, but we don't know, so I should plan based on current state.\n\nThe grid is small, 6x6 playable, with obstacle at (4,6).\n\nAvailable free cells: let's list all cells.\n\nx from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nOccupied: as above, after eating at (5,4), but let's not assume I eat yet.\n\nPerhaps I should consider not eating immediately if it leads to danger.\n\nBut (5,4) has life span 9, so I can eat it later.\n\nFor example, if I move U to (6,3) on turn 38, then I can go to (6,4) or (5,3), but not necessarily eat on turn 40.\n\nBut eating it gives me score and growth.\n\nBut growth might make it harder to maneuver.\n\nCurrent length 10, after eating 11.\n\nGrid has 36 cells, minus walls and obstacles, playable area: 6x6=36 cells, minus internal obstacle (4,6), so 35 cells? Walls are borders, not part of grid, I think.\n\nThe grid includes cells from (1,1) to (6,6), but walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (1,1) to (6,6) are all playable, except internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle: (4,6), so one cell blocked.\n\nSo total free cells: 36 - 1 = 35.\n\nSnake length 10, so 25 free cells.\n\nAfter eating, length 11, 24 free.\n\nStill plenty of space.\n\nBut the snake is coiled, so I need to uncoil or something.\n\nBack to turn 38 decision.\n\nOption 1: move L to (5,2)\n\nThen turn 39: must move U to (5,3)\n\nTurn 40: move U to (5,4) eat food.\n\nThen from (5,4), I can move U to (5,5) or R to (6,4)\n\nIf move U to (5,5), then head at (5,5), direction U.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (5,6), but y=6, and (4,6) is obstacle, but (5,6) is free? (5,6) not obstacle, and no wall, y=6 is playable.\n\n(5,6) should be free.\n\nD to (5,4) occupied, L to (4,5) but (4,5) is occupied? In positions, (4,5) is body, yes.\n\nR to (6,5) free? Not occupied.\n\nSo U to (5,6) or R to (6,5)\n\nIf move R to (6,4) from (5,4), then head to (6,4), direction R.\n\nThen moves: U to (6,5), D to (6,3) occupied, L to (5,4) occupied, R invalid, so only U to (6,5)\n\nThen to (6,5), etc.\n\nBut let's see the other option first.\n\nOption 2: move U to (6,3) on turn 38.\n\nThen turn 39: I can choose to move L to (5,3) or U to (6,4)\n\nIf move L to (5,3), then turn 40 I can move U to (5,4) to eat, same as before.\n\nOr, if on turn 39 I move U to (6,4), then turn 40 move L to (5,4) to eat.\n\nSo eating on turn 40 in both cases.\n\nBut if I move U to (6,4) on turn 39, then from (6,4) move L to (5,4) to eat.\n\nAfter that, head at (5,4), direction L (since I moved left to eat).\n\nThen possible moves: U to (5,5), D to (5,3) occupied, L to (4,4) occupied, R to (6,4) but (6,4) is where I came from? After moving to (5,4) and eating, the body includes (6,4) if I came from there.\n\nIn this case: turn 39: move U to (6,4), so head to (6,4)\n\nSnake: [(6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)] tail (4,5)\n\nThen turn 40: move L to (5,4), eat food, so new head (5,4), grow, body: (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) — tail (4,5)\n\nSo from (5,4), moves: U to (5,5), D to (5,3) occupied, L to (4,4) occupied, R to (6,4) occupied, so only U possible, move to (5,5)\n\nThen to (5,5), etc.\n\nIf I had eaten from the other way, similar.\n\nBut in the first option, when I moved L then U to eat, from (5,4) I had the choice of U or R, but R to (6,4) was free at that time.\n\nIn the body, when I ate after moving L then U, positions had (6,4) free.\n\nLet's compare the body after eating in different paths.\n\nFirst path (move L on 38, U on 39, U on 40 eat): after eating, snake: head (5,4), body (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) tail (4,5)\n\nSo occupied: (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nFree around head (5,4): U (5,5), R (6,4) both free.\n\nSecond path, if I move U on 38 to (6,3), then U on 39 to (6,4), then L on 40 to (5,4) eat: after eat, snake: head (5,4), body (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) tail (4,5)\n\nOccupied: (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nNow from (5,4), U (5,5) free, but R (6,4) occupied, L (4,4) occupied, D (5,3) occupied, so only U possible.\n\nSo in this case, after eating, I have only one choice: U to (5,5).\n\nWhereas in the first path, I have two choices.\n\nFor long-term survival, having more options is better.\n\nTherefore, moving L on turn 38 might be better because after eating, I have a choice.\n\nIn the second path, if on turn 39 I move L to (5,3) instead of U, then eat on turn 40, after eating, positions: head (5,4), body (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) tail (4,5)\n\nSimilar to first, but (6,3) instead of (5,2)? In first path, body has (5,2) and (6,2), here has (5,3) and (6,3).\n\nFrom (5,4), U (5,5) free, D (5,3) occupied, L (4,4) occupied, R (6,4) free? Not occupied, yes.\n\nSo again, U or R possible.\n\nSo in both cases, if I eat via (5,3), I have options after.\n\nBut if I go via (6,4), I get stuck with only U.\n\nSo to have flexibility, I should avoid going to (6,4) before eating.\n\nTherefore, on turn 38, moving U to (6,3) is fine, but on turn 39, I should move L to (5,3) instead of U to (6,4).\n\nThen turn 40 move U to (5,4) eat.\n\nAfter that, same as first option.\n\nNow, what about not eating immediately?\n\n(5,4) has life span 9, so I can eat later, but since it's positive food, no reason to delay, I should eat it to grow and score, as long as no immediate danger.\n\nHere, eating on turn 40 seems safe.\n\nNow, after eating, I need to think beyond.\n\nFor example, after head at (5,4), I can move U to (5,5) or R to (6,4).\n\nIf I move R to (6,4), then from (6,4), I can move U to (6,5) or, since direction R, I cannot move L, but L would be to (5,4) occupied anyway.\n\nFrom (6,4), moves: U to (6,5), D to (6,3) occupied, L to (5,4) occupied, R invalid, so only U to (6,5).\n\nThen to (6,5), then I can move U to (6,6) or L to (5,5) or R invalid.\n\n(6,6) is free, but y=6, and (5,6) etc.\n\nBut there's obstacle at (4,6), so (6,6) is free.\n\nIf I move U to (5,5) from (5,4), then from (5,5), I can move U to (5,6), L to (4,5) occupied? (4,5) is body, R to (6,5), or D to (5,4) occupied.\n\nSo U to (5,6), L to (4,5) invalid, R to (6,5) free.\n\nSo U or R.\n\nTo maximize long-term, I should explore open areas.\n\nThe top row y=6 has (1,6) to (6,6) except (4,6) obstacle, so (1,6),(2,6),(3,6),(5,6),(6,6) free, but (2,6) had food but it's gone now.\n\nCurrently, after turn 38, (2,6) disappears.\n\nFree cells: let's list for planning.\n\nAfter turn 38, regardless of move, the food (2,6) is gone.\n\nFood only (5,4) with life 9.\n\nBut other food may spawn, but we don't know, so assume only this for now.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should plan a path.\n\nPerhaps I should not eat the food yet if it traps me, but here it seems ok.\n\nAnother risk: the snake is long, and in a corner.\n\nCurrent snake positions: from (6,2) head, to (2,5) tail, it's like the snake is along the bottom and left.\n\nAfter moving, it might be better.\n\nLet's decide turn 38 action.\n\nI think moving L to (5,2) is acceptable, or U to (6,3).\n\nBut with L to (5,2), on turn 39 I have no choice, must U.\n\nWith U to (6,3), on turn 39 I can choose.\n\nFor flexibility, moving U to (6,3) might be better, so I can decide on turn 39 based on situation.\n\nBut in this case, since no other changes, it might not matter.\n\nBut let's think about the tail.\n\nTail is at (2,5), and if I move in a way that the tail moves, it frees space.\n\nFor example, if I move U to (6,3), then tail moves from (2,5) to, in the move, tail is removed, so (2,5) freed.\n\nThen from (6,3), I can go to (5,3) or (6,4).\n\n(5,3) is closer to food (5,4).\n\n(5,4) is at (5,4), so from (5,3) it's adjacent.\n\nSimilarly, from (6,4) it's adjacent.\n\nBut as before.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if there is negative food, but no, only positive mentioned.\n\nAnother thing: \"Special Cases: Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves on.\"\n\nBut here, no food under body, I think.\n\n(5,4) is free, not under snake.\n\n(2,6) is at (2,6), which might be under body? Snake positions include (2,5), (3,5), etc, (2,6) is different cell.\n\n(2,6) is above (2,5), so not under, unless body was there, but not.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, I should eat the food as soon as possible, on turn 40.\n\nFor turn 38, I can choose either move, but to have more options, let's move U to (6,3).\n\nThen on turn 39, I can move L to (5,3) to prepare for eating.\n\nThen turn 40 move U to (5,4) eat.\n\nThen after that, from (5,4), I can move U to (5,5) or R to (6,4).\n\nNow, to think ahead, after eating, the grid has many free cells.\n\nFor example, cells like (1,1) to (3,1), (1,2), (1,3), etc., but snake occupies some.\n\nAfter eating at turn 40, positions as before.\n\nAssume I moved U on 38, L on 39, U on 40 eat.\n\nThen snake: head (5,4), body (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) tail (4,5)\n\nOccupied: (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nFree around head: U (5,5), R (6,4)\n\nSay I move R to (6,4) on turn 41.\n\nThen head to (6,4), direction R (since I moved right).\n\nThen snake moves, no food, tail moves: new positions head (6,4), body (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) tail (4,4)? Tail was (4,5), removed, so new tail (4,4)\n\nList: previous: 0:(5,4) head, 1:(5,3), 2:(6,3), 3:(6,2), 4:(6,1), 5:(5,1), 6:(4,1), 7:(4,2), 8:(4,3), 9:(4,4), 10:(4,5) tail\n\nAfter move to (6,4): new head (6,4)\n\nBody: old head (5,4), old body1 (5,3), old body2 (6,3), old body3 (6,2), old body4 (6,1), old body5 (5,1), old body6 (4,1), old body7 (4,2), old body8 (4,3), old body9 (4,4)\n\nTail old body10 (4,5) removed.\n\nSo snake: [(6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)] tail (4,4)\n\nNow head at (6,4), direction R.\n\nMoves: U to (6,5), D to (6,3) occupied, L to (5,4) occupied, R invalid, so only U to (6,5)\n\nTurn 42: move U to (6,5)\n\nHead to (6,5), direction U.\n\nNew positions: head (6,5), body (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) tail (4,3)? Tail removed (4,4)\n\nPrevious: 0:(6,4) head, 1:(5,4), 2:(5,3), 3:(6,3), 4:(6,2), 5:(6,1), 6:(5,1), 7:(4,1), 8:(4,2), 9:(4,3), 10:(4,4) tail\n\nAfter move U to (6,5): new head (6,5)\n\nBody: old head (6,4), old body1 (5,4), old body2 (5,3), old body3 (6,3), old body4 (6,2), old body5 (6,1), old body6 (5,1), old body7 (4,1), old body8 (4,2), old body9 (4,3)\n\nTail old body10 (4,4) removed.\n\nSnake: [(6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)] tail (4,3)\n\nNow head (6,5), direction U.\n\nMoves: U to (6,6), D to (6,4) occupied, L to (5,5), R invalid.\n\n(6,6) and (5,5) both possible.\n\nSay move U to (6,6) on turn 43.\n\nThen to (6,6), direction U.\n\nThen from there, only L to (5,6) or D to (6,5) occupied.\n\nU invalid, y=7 wall.\n\nSo L to (5,6).\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut I need to think about avoiding dead ends.\n\nSince the food at (5,4) is eaten, no other food, but new food may spawn randomly, but for planning, I should assume no new food or consider exploring.\n\nTo survive long, I should move towards open areas.\n\nFor example, the top-right area has free cells: (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), etc.\n\nAfter eating, from (5,4), if I move U to (5,5) instead of R.\n\nTurn 41: from (5,4) move U to (5,5)\n\nHead to (5,5), direction U.\n\nThen moves: U to (5,6), L to (4,5) occupied? (4,5) is body, R to (6,5), D to (5,4) occupied.\n\nSo U to (5,6) or R to (6,5).\n\nSay move R to (6,5), then to (6,5), etc.\n\nSimilar.\n\nNow, back to turn 38, I think I should move U to (6,3) for more options on next turn.\n\nThen on turn 39, move L to (5,3)\n\nTurn 40 move U to (5,4) eat.\n\nThen on turn 41, I can move U to (5,5) or R to (6,4)\n\nTo have space, moving R to (6,4) might be better to go to the right.\n\nBut after that, I have to go up.\n\nSince the grid is small, I need to be careful not to trap myself.\n\nAnother idea: the tail is at (4,5) after eating, and if I move away, the tail will follow, freeing space.\n\nFor example, if I go up to (5,5), then to (5,6), then to (6,6), etc., the body will follow, and tail moves.\n\nBut the left side has free cells, like (1,1), (2,1), etc., but snake is on the right now.\n\nTo plan 5 turns: from turn 38 to 42 or so.\n\nSince I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the state might change with food spawn, but I have to assume no new food for planning, or consider possible.\n\nBut the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should plan a sequence.\n\nAlso, for the answer, I need to output actions starting from turn 38.\n\nLet me propose a sequence.\n\nTurn 38: move U to (6,3)  // for flexibility\n\nThen turn 39: move L to (5,3)  // to approach food\n\nTurn 40: move U to (5,4) eat food\n\nNow turn 41: from (5,4), move R to (6,4)  // to go right\n\nThen turn 42: from (6,4), only U to (6,5) as before\n\nThen turn 43: from (6,5), I can move U to (6,6) or L to (5,5)\n\nSay move U to (6,6)\n\nThen turn 44: from (6,6), move L to (5,6)\n\nEtc.\n\nBut after turn 40, when I move R to (6,4), on turn 41, then to (6,5) on 42, to (6,6) on 43, to (5,6) on 44.\n\nBut (5,6) is free, and (4,6) is obstacle, so from (5,6), I can move L to (4,6) invalid, D to (5,5), U invalid, R to (6,6) occupied, so only D to (5,5)\n\nThen to (5,5), and so on.\n\nThis might lead to a corner.\n\nIf from (6,5) on turn 43, I move L to (5,5) instead.\n\nThen from (5,5), I can move U to (5,6), L to (4,5) occupied, R to (6,5) occupied, D to (5,4) occupied, so only U to (5,6)\n\nThen to (5,6), then only D to (5,5) occupied? From (5,6), moves: D to (5,5), L to (4,6) invalid, R to (6,6), U invalid.\n\nSo D or R.\n\nIf D to (5,5), but (5,5) is where I came from, occupied.\n\nAfter moving to (5,6), head (5,6), body includes (5,5), so D to (5,5) invalid.\n\nL to (4,6) invalid, R to (6,6), U invalid, so only R to (6,6) if free.\n\nThen to (6,6), then L to (5,6) occupied, D to (6,5), etc.\n\nSo it can get messy.\n\nTo avoid this, after eating at (5,4), I should not go to the top row immediately.\n\nFor example, on turn 41, from (5,4), move U to (5,5) instead of R.\n\nThen from (5,5), move R to (6,5) on turn 42.\n\nThen from (6,5), move U to (6,6) or L to (5,6) or R invalid.\n\nSay move U to (6,6) on turn 43.\n\nThen from (6,6), move L to (5,6) on turn 44.\n\nThen from (5,6), move D to (5,5) but occupied, or R to (6,6) occupied, so only possible moves might be limited, but (5,5) might be free by then? Not necessarily.\n\nWith the tail moving, cells free up.\n\nFor example, when I move, the tail moves, so previous positions are freed.\n\nBut in the sequence, it might be tight.\n\nPerhaps I should move towards the center or left side.\n\nFor instance, from (5,4), after eating, move U to (5,5), then on turn 42, instead of R, move U to (5,6) if possible.\n\nFrom (5,5), move U to (5,6) on turn 42.\n\nThen head to (5,6), direction U.\n\nThen moves: D to (5,5) occupied, L to (4,6) invalid, R to (6,6), U invalid.\n\nSo only R to (6,6).\n\nThen on turn 43 move to (6,6), then on turn 44, only L to (5,6) occupied or D to (6,5).\n\nSo move D to (6,5).\n\nThen from (6,5), move D to (6,4) or L to (5,5), etc.\n\nIt works, but I'm circling.\n\nTo survive long, I need to go to areas with more space, like the bottom-left.\n\nFor example, cells (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (1,2), etc., are free.\n\nAfter eating, tail at (4,5), and body is on the right, so left side is free.\n\nFrom (5,4), if I could move left, but L is occupied.\n\nSo I have to go up or right.\n\nThen after moving to (6,4) or (5,5), I can head down or left when possible.\n\nFor example, from (6,4), I move U to (6,5), then to (6,6), then to (5,6), then to (5,5) if free, but not immediately.\n\nBut over time, as tail moves, cells free.\n\nFor instance, the tail is at (4,5), and as I move, it will move down and left, freeing space.\n\nSo it should be ok.\n\nBut for the immediate plan, since I need to output actions, I'll go with the sequence to eat the food and then move to open area.\n\nAlso, for the \"Tail Reward Danger\", it doesn't apply here.\n\nSo for turn 38, I'll move U to (6,3).\n\nThen turn 39 move L to (5,3)\n\nTurn 40 move U to (5,4) eat\n\nThen turn 41, move R to (6,4)  // to go right\n\nTurn 42 move U to (6,5)\n\nTurn 43 move U to (6,6)  // top-right\n\nThen beyond, but for 5 turns, from turn 38 to 42 or 43.\n\nTurn 38,39,40,41,42 is 5 turns.\n\nTurn 38: action for t=38\n\nTurn 39: t=39\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 42 or more.\n\nThe answer should include actions for several turns.\n\nSince the food life span is long, I could delay eating, but no reason, it's positive.\n\nOr to avoid growing too soon, but I think eating is fine.\n\nAnother risk: after eating, the snake is longer, but grid has space.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with:\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nTurn 39: L\n\nTurn 40: U (eat food)\n\nThen for turn 41: from (5,4), move R to (6,4)\n\nTurn 42: from (6,4), move U to (6,5)\n\nTurn 43: from (6,5), I can move U to (6,6) or L to (5,5)\n\nFor the output, I need to specify.\n\nSince thinking 5+ turns, I can do up to turn 42 or 43.\n\nLet's say up to turn 42 for 5 actions: 38,39,40,41,42.\n\nTurn 38 to 42 is 5 turns.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nTurn 39: L\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: R\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nFrom (6,4) on turn 41, after move R, head at (6,4), then turn 42 move U to (6,5)\n\nYes.\n\nTo have more options, on turn 41 from (5,4) move U to (5,5), then turn 42 move R to (6,5), etc.\n\nBut similar.\n\nI think it's fine.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I have planned the next 5 turns (turns 38 to 42) by thinking ahead about the snake's path, food consumption, and risk avoidance. The key considerations are:\n\n- **Immediate Food (2,6)**: It has a life span of 1 and will disappear after turn 38. However, it is too far from the head (Manhattan distance 8) to reach in one turn, so it is ignored.\n- **Primary Food (5,4)**: This positive food (+1 score, +1 length) has a life span of 9, so it can be eaten from turn 38 to 46. Eating it as soon as possible (on turn 40) is prioritized to gain score and growth without significant risk.\n- **Snake Path and Safety**: \n  - From turn 38, moving up to (6,3) avoids immediate body collisions and provides flexibility for future moves.\n  - On turn 39, moving left to (5,3) positions the snake to eat the food on turn 40.\n  - Eating on turn 40 is safe as (5,4) is not under the tail and no tail collision risk exists.\n  - After eating, moving right to (6,4) on turn 41 avoids boxing the snake in and heads toward open areas (top-right).\n  - Continuing up to (6,5) on turn 42 maintains options for future movement (e.g., to (6,6) or (5,5) on later turns).\n- **Risk Avoidance**: \n  - No instant reverse is possible (current direction U, so D is invalid on turn 38).\n  - Wall and obstacle at (4,6) are avoided.\n  - Body collisions are prevented by not moving into occupied cells except the tail (which moves away).\n  - The grid has 35 free cells (6x6 minus obstacle at (4,6)), and the snake length increases to 11 after eating, leaving 24 free cells—sufficient for maneuvering.\n- **Long-term Survival**: After turn 42, the snake can explore open areas like (6,6) or (5,5) to avoid dead ends. The tail movement frees space over time, allowing sustained exploration. New food may spawn, but the path keeps options open.\n\n### Planned Actions (Turns 38-42):\n- **Turn 38**: Move U (up) to (6,3). This avoids the body at (6,1) and walls, and sets up for food approach. Direction becomes U.\n- **Turn 39**: Move L (left) to (5,3). This positions the head adjacent to food at (5,4) with only one valid move (U) due to body constraints. Direction becomes L.\n- **Turn 40**: Move U (up) to (5,4) to eat the positive food. Snake grows to length 11, score increases by +1. Direction becomes U.\n- **Turn 41**: Move R (right) to (6,4). This moves toward open space, avoiding the body at (5,3) and (4,4). Only U is possible next, but it is safe. Direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 42**: Move U (up) to (6,5). This continues toward less crowded areas, with future options to (6,6) or (5,5). Direction becomes U.\n\n### Beyond Turn 42:\n- For turn 43+, consider moving to (6,6) or (5,5) to access the top row, then navigate down or left as space frees. Monitor for new food and avoid the obstacle at (4,6). Prioritize paths with multiple exits to reduce risk.\n\nThis sequence ensures the food is eaten efficiently while maintaining safety and flexibility for long-term play.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 38: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 39: \\text{L} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 40: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 41: \\text{R} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 42: \\text{U} \\end{array} }",

        "step": 39,
        "score": 9,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 39, and I'm the snake AI. My goal is to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks, and I should think at least 5 turns ahead, prioritizing long-term survival.\n\nThe grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and one internal obstacle at (4,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the edges and an obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: Head at (6,3), then body segments: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), and tail at (3,5). Head direction is Up, meaning the snake is moving upwards.\n\nFood: There's one food item at (5,4) with value 1 and life span 9. Since life span decreases every turn, including the current one, it will disappear after 9 more turns, but I need to check if I can eat it before then.\n\nFood life span: It says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn 39, food at (5,4) has life span 9, meaning it will be there until turn 39 + 9 - 1? Let's clarify.\n\nIf life span is N at turn t, it decreases every turn, so after N turns, it should be gone. For example, at turn t, life span N, it will be present on turns t, t+1, ..., t+(N-1), and gone on turn t+N. Since countdown decreases every turn including current, at turn t, life span is N, meaning it has N turns left including this one. So on turn t, it has life span N, after this turn, on turn t+1, it has life span N-1, and so on, until life span 0, it disappears.\n\nThe input says: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: (5,4,9,1)\" – I think this means position (5,4), value 1, life span 9.\n\nAnd \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\", so with life_span=9 at turn 39, it will disappear after 9 turns, meaning on turn 48 it will be gone. It is present from turn 39 to 47 inclusive.\n\nNow, snake head is at (6,3) and direction is Up. Since it's moving Up, last move was Up, so from (6,2) to (6,3).\n\nPossible moves: I can move Up, Down, Left, Right, but with constraints.\n\nCurrent head direction is U, so I cannot move Down immediately because that would be opposite direction. \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nCurrent direction is U, so I cannot move D (down) because that would be reverse.\n\nAllowed moves: U (up), L (left), R (right). Down is not allowed.\n\nNow, grid bounds: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake body: positions are given, so I need to avoid colliding with body except for the tail, which is moving.\n\nLet's list all snake positions to see where the body is:\n\n- Head: (6,3)\n\n- Body: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)\n\n(3,5) is the tail.\n\nNow, food is at (5,4).\n\nI need to think about eating this food. But there's a risk: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills snake because head and newly grown tail collide.\n\nFirst, is head adjacent to tail? Tail is at (3,5), head at (6,3). Distance: |6-3| = 3 in x, |3-5| = 2 in y, so not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, like one cell away horizontally or vertically.\n\n(6,3) and (3,5): x differs by 3, y by 2, so not adjacent. Adjacent cells would be, for example, (5,3), (6,4), (7,3), (6,2) but (6,2) is body, not tail.\n\nTail is at (3,5), so cells adjacent to tail: (3,4), (3,6), (2,5), (4,5). But (4,5) is part of body, not free. Head is at (6,3), which is not adjacent to (3,5). So no issue with tail reward danger for this food, since food is at (5,4), not on tail.\n\nFood is at (5,4), which is a different cell.\n\nNow, let's see the grid layout to plan moves.\n\nI should sketch a small grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacle: (4,6)\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- (6,3) head\n\n- (6,2)\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (5,1)\n\n- (4,1)\n\n- (4,2)\n\n- (4,3)\n\n- (4,4)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (3,5) tail\n\nFood: (5,4) with value 1, life span 9.\n\nNow, head at (6,3), direction U.\n\nPossible moves from (6,3):\n\n- Up (U): to (6,4)\n\n- Down (D): but cannot, because reverse direction, current direction U, so D is opposite, not allowed.\n\n- Left (L): to (5,3)\n\n- Right (R): to (7,3) but x=7 is wall, so cannot move right, collision.\n\nx=7 is wall, so (7,3) is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 and y=7 walls.\n\nSo from (6,3), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (6,4)\n\n- L: to (5,3)\n\n- D: not allowed (reverse)\n\n- R: to (7,3) but wall, invalid.\n\nSo only U or L.\n\nNow, let's see what happens if I move U to (6,4).\n\n(6,4) is not occupied by body or wall? Body positions: (6,2), (6,1), etc. (6,4) is not in the list, so free? But we need to check if food is there or something.\n\nFood is at (5,4), not (6,4).\n\nAlso, walls: (6,4) should be within bounds, y=4, x=6, not wall except borders, but x=6 not wall, y=4 not wall.\n\nInternal obstacle (4,6), not here.\n\nSo (6,4) is free.\n\nIf I move to (6,4), snake grows only if I eat food, but no food at (6,4), so length unchanged, tail moves away.\n\nAfter move, head to (6,4), body follows: new positions: head (6,4), then (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), and tail (3,5) is removed? When snake moves without eating, tail is removed.\n\nSnake movement: when head moves to a new cell, if no food, tail is removed, so snake length same.\n\nIf eat food, tail not removed, so length increases by one.\n\nHere, moving to (6,4), no food, so tail (3,5) is removed, head to (6,4), and body segments shift: the old head (6,3) becomes new body part, and so on down to the tail.\n\nSpecifically: new head at (6,4), then the previous positions except the tail is removed.\n\nCurrent positions: [ (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5) ]\n\nAfter moving head to (6,4) without eating, new positions: [ (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) ] and (3,5) is gone. (4,5) is now the last body segment before tail, but tail is removed, so positions from head to (4,5), which is 10 segments? Original has 10 positions? Let's count.\n\nOriginal positions: 10 segments? List: indices 0 to 9? (6,3) head, (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5) tail. So 10 segments.\n\nAfter move to (6,4) no eat: new head at (6,4), then the first body is old head (6,3), then (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), and (3,5) is removed. So now snake has head (6,4), body: (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). 10 segments still? No: original 10 segments, after move without eat, length same, so 10 segments but tail removed, so it should be 9 segments? I think I confused.\n\nStandard snake: if no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail position is vacated.\n\nSo number of segments remains the same unless food eaten.\n\nHere, 10 segments initially.\n\nAfter moving head to new position without eating:\n\n- New head: (6,4)\n\n- Body: the old head becomes body, so (6,3) is now first body segment.\n\nThen (6,2) is next, from old body.\n\n(6,1) from old.\n\n(5,1) from old.\n\n(4,1) from old.\n\n(4,2) from old.\n\n(4,3) from old.\n\n(4,4) from old.\n\n(4,5) from old.\n\nAnd the old tail (3,5) is no longer part of snake; it moves to the position of the second last segment.\n\nThe segments: index 0: head, 1,2,3,...,9: tail.\n\nAfter move, new head at new position, new segment 1 is old head, new segment 2 is old segment 1, ..., new segment 9 is old segment 8, and old segment 9 (tail) is gone.\n\nSo in this case, old segments: 0:(6,3), 1:(6,2), 2:(6,1), 3:(5,1), 4:(4,1), 5:(4,2), 6:(4,3), 7:(4,4), 8:(4,5), 9:(3,5)\n\nAfter move to (6,4) no eat:\n\nNew segment 0: (6,4) head\n\nNew segment 1: old segment 0 = (6,3)\n\nNew segment 2: old segment 1 = (6,2)\n\nNew segment 3: old segment 2 = (6,1)\n\nNew segment 4: old segment 3 = (5,1)\n\nNew segment 5: old segment 4 = (4,1)\n\nNew segment 6: old segment 5 = (4,2)\n\nNew segment 7: old segment 6 = (4,3)\n\nNew segment 8: old segment 7 = (4,4)\n\nNew segment 9: old segment 8 = (4,5)  // old segment 8 is (4,5), which was part of body\n\nOld segment 8 is (4,5), and old segment 9 is (3,5) tail gone.\n\nSo new tail is new segment 9 = old segment 8 = (4,5)\n\nNew positions: head (6,4), then (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)  // 10 segments? (4,5) is the tail now.\n\nBut (4,5) was previously occupied, but now it's the tail.\n\nSimilarly, if I move Left to (5,3).\n\nBut back to decision.\n\nFrom (6,3), move U to (6,4) or L to (5,3).\n\nNow, food is at (5,4), which is adjacent to head? Head at (6,3), food at (5,4), so relative positions: (5,4) is left and up from (6,3), so not directly adjacent; it's diagonal? Adjacent means sharing edge, so (6,3) has neighbors: (6,4) up, (6,2) down, (5,3) left, (7,3) right but wall.\n\nSo (5,4) is not adjacent to (6,3); it's one step left and one step up, so two moves away.\n\nFrom (6,3), to reach (5,4), I need to move left then up, or up then left, etc.\n\nNow, I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, food life span 9, so I have time, but I should plan to eat it if possible and safe.\n\nBut there might be risks.\n\nFirst, let's consider the grid state.\n\nThe snake has a lot of body in the bottom-left area, around (4,1) to (4,5) and (3,5), (5,1), etc.\n\nHead is at (6,3), which is near the right wall.\n\nFood at (5,4).\n\nIf I want to eat the food at (5,4), I need to move to (5,4) when the cell is free.\n\nCurrently, (5,4) is not occupied by snake body? Let's see body positions: (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5). (5,4) is not in this list, so it should be free, except for the food.\n\nFood is on the cell, so it can be eaten if head moves there.\n\nBut to move to (5,4), from current position (6,3), I can go directly? Not directly, because (5,4) is not adjacent; it's diagonal.\n\nFrom (6,3), adjacent cells are (6,4), (5,3), (6,2) but (6,2) is body, occupied, and down not allowed.\n\nSo from (6,3), I can go to (6,4) or (5,3).\n\nIf I go to (5,3), then from there, I can go to (5,4) or other directions.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (6,4), then from there I can go to (6,5) or (5,4) or (7,4) but (7,4) wall.\n\n(6,4) neighbors: U (6,5), D (6,3) but (6,3) will be body after move, L (5,4), R (7,4) wall.\n\nSo let's think about paths to food.\n\nFood at (5,4).\n\nFrom head (6,3):\n\n- If I move L to (5,3), then from (5,3) I can move U to (5,4) to eat food.\n\n- If I move U to (6,4), then from (6,4) I can move L to (5,4) to eat food.\n\nBoth are possible in two moves.\n\nBut I need to consider the state after each move.\n\nAlso, after eating, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, which might cause issues.\n\nMoreover, I need to think about survival and future moves.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving left to (5,3) now.\n\nTurn 39: move L to (5,3)\n\nThen snake head to (5,3), no food there, so tail moves, new positions: head (5,3), then (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)  // and (3,5) gone? Old tail (3,5) removed, so body from (6,3) to (4,5), but (4,5) is now tail.\n\nNew segments: new head (5,3), new body 1: old head (6,3), body 2: old body 1 (6,2), body 3: old body 2 (6,1), body 4: old body 3 (5,1), body 5: old body 4 (4,1), body 6: old body 5 (4,2), body 7: old body 6 (4,3), body 8: old body 7 (4,4), body 9: old body 8 (4,5) tail.\n\nSo positions: [(5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)]\n\nNow head at (5,3), direction: since I moved L, new direction is L.\n\nFrom here, I can move to (5,4) to eat food.\n\nMove U to (5,4).\n\nFood at (5,4), so I eat it, value +1, length increases.\n\nAfter eating, head moves to (5,4), food consumed, snake grows, so tail not removed.\n\nNew head (5,4), then the body segments: old head (5,3) becomes body, and all previous body segments remain, so new positions: head (5,4), then (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)  // and since ate, no removal, so length 11 now, tail still (4,5)? No.\n\nOld positions before move: [(5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)]\n\nAfter moving head to (5,4) and eating: new head (5,4), then new body 1: old head (5,3), new body 2: old body 1 (6,3), new body 3: old body 2 (6,2), new body 4: old body 3 (6,1), new body 5: old body 4 (5,1), new body 6: old body 5 (4,1), new body 7: old body 6 (4,2), new body 8: old body 7 (4,3), new body 9: old body 8 (4,4), new body 10: old body 9 (4,5) tail.\n\nSo tail is still at (4,5), but now it's body segment 10.\n\nNow, the snake is longer.\n\nBut is there a risk? After eating, the head is at (5,4), and tail is at (4,5), which is adjacent? (5,4) and (4,5) are diagonally adjacent, not sharing edge, so not adjacent in terms of collision. Collision is with body segments except tail when moving.\n\nBody segments: (5,3), (6,3), etc., (5,4) has neighbors: U (5,5), D (5,3) which is body, L (4,4) which is body, R (6,4) which is free? Let's see positions.\n\nHead at (5,4), body segments: (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nSo cells around (5,4): up (5,5) - free? Not occupied, down (5,3) - occupied by body, left (4,4) - occupied by body, right (6,4) - not occupied.\n\nSo from (5,4), possible moves: U to (5,5), or R to (6,4), since D and L are body.\n\nD to (5,3) is body, collision if I move there, similarly L to (4,4) body.\n\nBut I can move U or R.\n\nAlso, direction: since I moved U to (5,4), new direction is U.\n\nNow, what about the other option: if I first move U to (6,4) on turn 39.\n\nTurn 39: move U to (6,4)\n\nNo food, so tail moves: new positions: head (6,4), then (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)  // (3,5) gone\n\nNow head at (6,4), direction U.\n\nFrom here, I can move L to (5,4) to eat food.\n\nMove L to (5,4), eat, grow.\n\nNew head (5,4), then (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)  // since ate, tail not removed, so (4,5) remains, length 11.\n\nTail at (4,5).\n\nNow similar to before.\n\nIn both cases, after eating, head at (5,4), with body around.\n\nBut in the first sequence (move L then U), after eating, head at (5,4), and body includes (5,3) and (4,4), so only U and R are free moves.\n\nSimilarly in second sequence, same thing.\n\nBut I need to think beyond eating the food.\n\nAlso, there might be negative food, but here only one food, positive.\n\nBut I should consider the area and potential traps.\n\nLook at the snake body: it has a lot of segments in the left and bottom, like a column at x=4 from y=1 to 5, and the tail at (4,5).\n\nAfter eating, the snake is longer, and I need to find a path to survive.\n\nMoreover, there is an obstacle at (4,6), which is above.\n\ny=6, x=4.\n\nAlso, walls.\n\nNow, let's see the available space.\n\nFor example, from (5,4) after eating, I can move U to (5,5) or R to (6,4).\n\nIf I move U to (5,5), then from there, I can go to (5,6), (4,5), (6,5), etc.\n\nBut (4,5) might be occupied or not.\n\nIn the state after eating, (4,5) is tail or body.\n\nIn both cases, after eating, (4,5) is a body segment.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) might be free.\n\nLet's think about the grid.\n\nI should consider not eating immediately if it leads to dead end.\n\nBut the food is positive, and I need to maximize score, so I should eat it if possible.\n\nBut with life span 9, I can delay.\n\nBut delaying might not be good if there are risks.\n\nFirst, let's see if moving to (5,3) or (6,4) now is safe.\n\nFrom (6,3), if I move L to (5,3):\n\n(5,3) is free? Currently, body positions don't include (5,3), so yes.\n\nAfter move, head at (5,3), body includes (6,3), which is now behind.\n\nThen from (5,3), I can move to eat food at (5,4) by moving U.\n\nBut when I move U to (5,4), I eat, grow.\n\nThen as before.\n\nIf I move U to (6,4) first, similar.\n\nBut let's see what happens after eating.\n\nSuppose I eat on turn 40.\n\nTurn 39: move L to (5,3)\n\nTurn 40: move U to (5,4) eat\n\nThen head at (5,4), body: (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nNow, from (5,4), I can move U to (5,5) or R to (6,4).\n\nIf I move R to (6,4), which is free? (6,4) is not in body, so free.\n\nThen new head (6,4), and since no food (food eaten), tail moves, so (4,5) removed? After eating on turn 40, head to (5,4), no tail removal.\n\nThen on turn 41, if I move R to (6,4), no food there, so tail removed.\n\nLet's sequence.\n\nAfter turn 40: head at (5,4), body: (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)  // 11 segments\n\nOn turn 41, move R to (6,4), no food, so new head (6,4), new body 1: (5,4), new body 2: (5,3), new body 3: (6,3), new body 4: (6,2), new body 5: (6,1), new body 6: (5,1), new body 7: (4,1), new body 8: (4,2), new body 9: (4,3), new body 10: (4,4)  // and (4,5) removed, so tail at (4,4)\n\nPositions: head (6,4), body (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) tail.\n\nNow head at (6,4), direction R (since moved right).\n\nFrom here, I can move U to (6,5), D to (6,3) but (6,3) is body, L to (5,4) but (5,4) is body, R to (7,4) wall.\n\nSo only possible move U to (6,5), since D and L are body, R wall.\n\n(6,5) is free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\nSo move U to (6,5).\n\nThen similarly, from (6,5), I can go to (6,6), (5,5), etc.\n\nBut there's obstacle at (4,6), so (4,6) is blocked.\n\ny=6, x=4.\n\nAlso, y=7 wall.\n\nSo from (6,5), move U to (6,6), then from (6,6), I can move U to (6,7) but y=7 wall, or L to (5,6), or R to (7,6) wall.\n\n(5,6) might be free.\n\nBut let's not go too far.\n\nBack to turn 39 decision.\n\nIf I move U first to (6,4) on turn 39.\n\nTurn 39: move U to (6,4) no eat, new positions: head (6,4), then (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nTail at (4,5).\n\nThen turn 40: move L to (5,4) eat food.\n\nNew head (5,4), then (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)  // 11 segments, tail (4,5)\n\nNow from (5,4), direction L (since moved left).\n\nMoves: U to (5,5), D to (5,3), L to (4,4), R to (6,4)\n\nBut (4,4) is body, (6,4) is body, (5,3) might be free or not.\n\nPositions: (5,4) head, body (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nSo (5,3) is not occupied, so D to (5,3) is possible.\n\nL to (4,4) is body, collision.\n\nR to (6,4) is body, collision.\n\nU to (5,5) free.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (5,5) or D to (5,3)\n\nIf I move U to (5,5), or D to (5,3).\n\nIf I move D to (5,3), which is down, then from there, I can go to (5,2), etc.\n\nBut (5,3) might be close to body.\n\nIn this case, after eating at (5,4), moving D to (5,3) might be possible.\n\nBut let's compare the two approaches.\n\nIn the first approach (move L then U eat), after eating, from (5,4), I can move U or R.\n\nIn second approach (move U then L eat), after eating, from (5,4), I can move U or D.\n\nSo in first case, after eating at (5,4) with move L then U, the body has (5,3) adjacent, so only U and R free.\n\nIn second case, after move U then L, the body has (6,4) adjacent, so only U and D free.\n\nBut (5,3) is free in second case.\n\nTo have more options, perhaps the second way is better because after eating, I can move down to (5,3) which is open, whereas in first way, (5,3) is body.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nAfter eating in first sequence (turn 39 L to (5,3), turn 40 U to (5,4) eat):\n\nPositions: head (5,4), body (5,3), (6,3), ... so (5,3) is body, so from (5,4), down to (5,3) is body, not free.\n\nLeft to (4,4) body, right to (6,4) free, up to (5,5) free.\n\nSo moves: U or R.\n\nAfter second sequence (turn 39 U to (6,4), turn 40 L to (5,4) eat):\n\nPositions: head (5,4), body (6,4), (6,3), ... so (6,4) is body, (5,3) is not occupied, (4,4) is body.\n\n(5,3) is not in positions, so free.\n\nSo from (5,4), down to (5,3) free, up to (5,5) free, left to (4,4) body, right to (6,4) body.\n\nSo moves: U or D.\n\nTherefore, in the second sequence, after eating, I have the option to move down to (5,3), which might be better for escaping the area, whereas in first sequence, I have to go up or right, into a narrower space.\n\nMoreover, the area around (5,3) and below might have more space.\n\nCurrent body: in both cases, the body is similar, but in the first sequence after eating, (5,3) is occupied, so I can't go down.\n\nIn second sequence, (5,3) is free, so I can go down.\n\nAlso, (6,3) is occupied in both, but in second sequence, when I move to (5,4) from (6,4), the body includes (6,4), so (6,4) occupied.\n\nBut (5,3) is free.\n\nNow, the bottom area: around (5,2), (5,1) is body, (4,1) body, etc.\n\n(5,1) is body, so (5,2) might be free.\n\nLet's see the grid.\n\nI should consider the long-term survival.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid eating the food now and go to a safer area.\n\nBut food is positive, and I should eat it if possible.\n\nBut with life span 9, I have time, so maybe I can first move to open space and then come back.\n\nFor example, from current position (6,3), I can move U to (6,4), then to (6,5), etc., to explore the top-right area, which seems less occupied.\n\nThen later come back for food.\n\nBut the food might disappear if I delay too long.\n\nLife span 9, so I have until turn 47 to eat it.\n\nTurn 39 now, life span 9, so present until turn 47, can be eaten on turn 47.\n\nSo I can delay.\n\nBut I need to think about risks.\n\nCurrent position (6,3), if I move L to (5,3), I am closer to the food but also closer to the dense body area.\n\nIf I move U to (6,4), I am moving away from the body cluster.\n\nThen from (6,4), I can go to (6,5), then to (6,6), but at (6,6), I can go left to (5,6), etc.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (4,6), so the top-left might be blocked.\n\nLet's list free cells or something.\n\nPerhaps I should simulate a few turns.\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns? The answer format is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but the answer should be the actions for the immediate turns, I think, but with the thinking ahead.\n\nThe output is \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but it doesn't specify how many turns, so probably I need to decide for the next few turns, at least until I eat or something.\n\nBut the user didn't specify how many turns to output, so perhaps I should output for the current turn and maybe one or two ahead, but with the thinking.\n\nSince it's a sequence, I can output for a few turns.\n\nBut let's see the core rules.\n\nI think for the answer, I need to provide the action for turn 39, and then for subsequent turns as per my plan.\n\nBut to be safe, I can provide for turn 39 and indicate the plan.\n\nThe format says: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ... } so I need to list the actions.\n\nProbably for a few turns, but I can do until I eat the food or something.\n\nSince thinking ahead is internal, I can decide turn 39 action based on long-term.\n\nBut for output, I need to specify actions.\n\nPerhaps I can output only turn 39 action, but the format shows multiple.\n\nLet's assume I output for the current turn and the next few, say 5 turns.\n\nBut the state might change with food, but here only one food.\n\nAnother thing: food can spawn under body, but here it's not, it's at (5,4) free.\n\nAlso, special case: food under body can be eaten only if body moves away and head moves on.\n\nBut here, (5,4) is free, so no issue.\n\nNow, back to decision.\n\nI think moving up first might be better to avoid the body cluster.\n\nIf I move U to (6,4) on turn 39, then I can move to (6,5) on turn 40, then to (6,6) on turn 41, then from (6,6), I can move L to (5,6) on turn 42, then to (5,5) or (4,6) but (4,6) is obstacle, so to (5,5), then from (5,5) I can move to (5,4) to eat food if it's still there.\n\nBut on turn 42, food life span: at turn 39, life span 9, so on turn 40, life span 8, turn 41:7, turn 42:6, so still there.\n\nFrom (5,5), move D to (5,4) to eat.\n\nBut when I move to (5,4), I eat, and the snake grows.\n\nBut let's see the position at that time.\n\nFirst, turn 39: move U to (6,4)\n\nNew positions: head (6,4), body (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) tail.\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 40: from (6,4), I can move U to (6,5) or L to (5,4) to eat now, but if I move L, I eat immediately.\n\nBut if I want to delay, move U to (6,5)\n\n(6,5) is free, not wall, not body.\n\nMove U to (6,5), no food, so tail moves: new head (6,5), body (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)  // (4,5) removed\n\nTail at (4,4).\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 41: from (6,5), move U to (6,6)\n\n(6,6) free, move U, no food, new head (6,6), body (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)  // (4,4) removed, tail at (4,3)\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 42: from (6,6), move L to (5,6)  // since U to (6,7) wall, R to (7,6) wall, D to (6,5) body, so only L to (5,6)\n\n(5,6) free, move L, no food, new head (5,6), body (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2)  // (4,3) removed, tail at (4,2)\n\nDirection L.\n\nNow, from (5,6), I can move to eat the food at (5,4).\n\nFood at (5,4), which is two steps down.\n\nFrom (5,6), move D to (5,5), then D to (5,4) to eat.\n\nBut (5,5) might be free.\n\nFirst, move D to (5,5) on turn 43.\n\nTurn 43: from (5,6), move D to (5,5)\n\n(5,5) free, move D, no food, new head (5,5), body (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)  // (4,2) removed, tail at (4,1)? Body: new head (5,5), body 1: old head (5,6), body 2: old body 1 (6,6), body 3: old body 2 (6,5), body 4: old body 3 (6,4), body 5: old body 4 (6,3), body 6: old body 5 (6,2), body 7: old body 6 (6,1), body 8: old body 7 (5,1), body 9: old body 8 (4,1), and old body 9 (4,2) removed, so tail at (4,1)\n\nPositions: head (5,5), then (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)\n\nNow, food at (5,4) is below, (5,4) is not occupied, so I can move D to (5,4) on turn 44.\n\nTurn 44: move D to (5,4) eat food.\n\nThen head at (5,4), grow, so tail not removed, new positions: head (5,4), then (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)  // 11 segments\n\nNow, from here, I have the snake with head at (5,4), and body from (5,5) down to (4,1), so I am surrounded.\n\nCells around (5,4): U (5,5) body, D (5,3) free? Not occupied, L (4,4) but (4,4) not in positions, R (6,4) body.\n\nPositions: (5,4) head, (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)\n\nSo (5,3) not occupied, (4,4) not occupied, (6,4) occupied.\n\n(4,4) is free, (5,3) free.\n\nFrom (5,4), possible moves: D to (5,3), L to (4,4), U to (5,5) body, R to (6,4) body.\n\nSo U and R are body, collision if moved.\n\nD to (5,3) free, L to (4,4) free.\n\nSo I can move D or L.\n\nIf I move D to (5,3), or L to (4,4).\n\n(4,4) might be near the obstacle.\n\nBut I can escape to the bottom.\n\nFor example, move D to (5,3), then to (5,2), etc.\n\nBut (5,2) might be free.\n\nIn this case, by delaying the food, I ended up with the snake in a position where I can still move after eating.\n\nCompared to eating immediately, which might be similar.\n\nBut in the immediate eat case, if I eat on turn 40, I am at (5,4) with body around, and I have to move to open space.\n\nBut in the delayed case, I have more body behind.\n\nBut I think both are possible.\n\nHowever, in the current state, if I move L to (5,3) on turn 39, I am moving into the body area, which might be riskier if I don't eat immediately.\n\nFor example, from (5,3), if I don't eat, I can move to other places, but (5,3) has limited moves.\n\nFrom (5,3), after moving L on turn 39, positions: head (5,3), body (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nDirection L.\n\nFrom here, possible moves: U to (5,4) to eat, D to (5,2), L to (4,3), R to (6,3) body.\n\nR to (6,3) is body, so not possible.\n\nU to (5,4) eat, D to (5,2), L to (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is body? Positions include (4,3), so (4,3) occupied, cannot move there.\n\nBody positions: (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nSo (4,3) is occupied, so L to (4,3) not possible.\n\nD to (5,2): (5,2) not in positions, so free.\n\nU to (5,4) free with food.\n\nSo only U or D.\n\nIf I move D to (5,2), then I am going down, away from food.\n\nBut food is at (5,4), so if I go down, I might not eat it soon.\n\nBut I can come back.\n\nHowever, moving to (5,2) might be dead end if not careful.\n\n(5,2) is free, from there I can go to (5,1) but (5,1) is body, or (4,2) body, or (6,2) body, or (5,3) which is head now, but after move.\n\nIf I move D to (5,2) on turn 40, new head (5,2), body (5,3), (6,3), etc., tail removed.\n\nThen from (5,2), moves: U to (5,3) body, D to (5,1) body, L to (4,2) body, R to (6,2) body. All surrounded? (5,3) is body, (5,1) body, (4,2) body, (6,2) body, so no possible move, death.\n\nOh! So if I move to (5,3) and then not eat, and move down, I die immediately.\n\nTherefore, from (5,3), the only safe move is to eat the food at (5,4) by moving up. If I move down to (5,2), I collide because all adjacent cells are occupied.\n\nSo, if I move left to (5,3) on turn 39, I must move up to (5,4) on turn 40 to eat, otherwise I die.\n\nTherefore, moving left forces me to eat immediately on the next turn.\n\nWhereas if I move up to (6,4), I have more options: I can eat immediately on turn 40 by moving left, or I can go up to explore.\n\nSince moving left is risky if I don't eat, but I can eat, so it's ok, but I have less flexibility.\n\nIn contrast, moving up to (6,4) gives me the choice to eat or not on turn 40.\n\nTherefore, for long-term survival and flexibility, moving up first is better.\n\nMoreover, by moving up, I can access the top area which has more space.\n\nSo I think for turn 39, I should move Up.\n\nThen on turn 40, I can decide to eat or not.\n\nBut since the food is positive and I can eat it safely, I might as well eat it on turn 40 to get the score.\n\nOn turn 40, from (6,4), moving L to (5,4) eats the food, and as we saw, after eating, I can move up or down depending on the sequence.\n\nIn the move U then L eat sequence, after eating at (5,4), I can move U to (5,5) or D to (5,3).\n\nMoving down to (5,3) might be better to go to less crowded area.\n\nFor example, from (5,4) after eating, move D to (5,3), then from (5,3), I can move to (5,2) if free, but (5,2) might be free at that time.\n\nIn the state after eating, (5,2) is not occupied, so I can go down.\n\nThen to (5,1) but (5,1) is body, so not, but I can go left or right.\n\nBut let's not detail.\n\nSince I need to output actions, I can plan to eat on turn 40.\n\nSo for turn 39: move U to (6,4)\n\nTurn 40: move L to (5,4) eat\n\nThen from there, I need to choose a move.\n\nBut I should think 5 turns ahead.\n\nAfter turn 40, head at (5,4), direction L.\n\nThen I can move D to (5,3) on turn 41.\n\n(5,3) is free, as established.\n\nMove D to (5,3), no food, so tail moves.\n\nPositions before move: head (5,4), body (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)  // 11 segments\n\nAfter move D to (5,3) no eat: new head (5,3), new body 1: (5,4), new body 2: (6,4), new body 3: (6,3), new body 4: (6,2), new body 5: (6,1), new body 6: (5,1), new body 7: (4,1), new body 8: (4,2), new body 9: (4,3), new body 10: (4,4)  // and (4,5) removed, tail at (4,4)\n\nNow head at (5,3), direction D.\n\nFrom here, possible moves: U to (5,4) body, D to (5,2), L to (4,3), R to (6,3) body.\n\n(5,4) is body, (6,3) is body, (5,2) not occupied, (4,3) not occupied? Positions: (5,3) head, (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n\n(4,3) is in positions, so occupied.\n\nL to (4,3) is body, collision.\n\nD to (5,2) free.\n\nR to (6,3) body, not possible.\n\nU to (5,4) body, not possible.\n\nSo only D to (5,2).\n\nMove D to (5,2) on turn 42.\n\n(5,2) free, move D, no food, new head (5,2), body (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)  // (4,4) removed, tail at (4,3)\n\nDirection D.\n\nNow from (5,2), moves: U to (5,3) body, D to (5,1) body, L to (4,2) body, R to (6,2) body. All occupied, death again.\n\nProblem: after moving down from (5,4), I end up trapped at (5,2).\n\nTherefore, moving down after eating is bad.\n\nAfter eating at (5,4), I should move up to (5,5) instead.\n\nIn the second sequence.\n\nTurn 39: move U to (6,4)\n\nTurn 40: move L to (5,4) eat\n\nThen turn 41: move U to (5,5)\n\n(5,5) free, no food, so new head (5,5), body (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)  // (4,5) removed? After eating, on turn 40, positions 11 segments, then turn 41 move U to (5,5) no eat, so tail removed: new head (5,5), new body 1: (5,4), new body 2: (6,4), ..., up to new body 10: old body 9 or something.\n\nOld positions turn 40: head (5,4), body (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nAfter move U to (5,5) no eat: new head (5,5), new body 1: old head (5,4), new body 2: old body 1 (6,4), new body 3: old body 2 (6,3), new body 4: old body 3 (6,2), new body 5: old body 4 (6,1), new body 6: old body 5 (5,1), new body 7: old body 6 (4,1), new body 8: old body 7 (4,2), new body 9: old body 8 (4,3), new body 10: old body 9 (4,4)  // and old body 10 (4,5) removed, tail at (4,4)\n\nPositions: head (5,5), then (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nNow head at (5,5), direction U.\n\nFrom here, I can move U to (5,6), D to (5,4) body, L to (4,5), R to (6,5)\n\n(5,4) is body, so D not possible.\n\nL to (4,5): (4,5) not occupied, free.\n\nR to (6,5): (6,5) not occupied, free.\n\nU to (5,6): free.\n\nAlso, obstacle at (4,6), so (4,6) blocked.\n\nSo moves: U, L, or R.\n\nFor example, move U to (5,6) or L to (4,5), etc.\n\nMore space.\n\nTherefore, better to move up after eating.\n\nSo for the immediate actions:\n\nTurn 39: move U to (6,4)\n\nTurn 40: move L to (5,4) eat food\n\nThen turn 41: move U to (5,5)\n\nAfter that, I can continue.\n\nBut I need to output only for a few turns, or as per the sequence.\n\nSince the thinking is for survival, and I have a plan.\n\nFor the answer, I can provide:\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: L\n\nThen for turn 41, I can say U, but it's optional.\n\nBut the format shows multiple turns, so I can do for 3 turns or so.\n\nSince food is eaten by turn 40, and I have a path, it should be fine.\n\nTo be thorough, I can include turn 41.\n\nBut let's confirm the direction.\n\nAfter turn 40 move L to (5,4), direction is L.\n\nThen turn 41 move U to (5,5), which is not reverse? Reverse would be R, but I'm moving U, so ok.\n\nThen from there, I have options.\n\nSo I think this is good.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: L\n\nIf I output only these, but for turn 41 I can infer.\n\nSince the user might expect the sequence until something.\n\nBut I think for now, with thinking ahead, I decided to move U first.\n\nSo for the boxed answer.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I need to think at least 5 turns ahead. The current state (turn 39) has the snake head at (6,3) moving upward, with a positive food at (5,4) (value +1, life span 9). The grid is 8x8 with walls at the borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and an internal obstacle at (4,6). The snake body occupies multiple cells, creating a dense cluster in the bottom-left area, especially around x=4 and y=1-5.\n\n#### Key Considerations:\n- **Immediate Moves (Turn 39)**: From (6,3), current direction is Up (U). Reverse move (Down) is invalid. Moving Right to (7,3) hits the wall. Valid moves are Up (U) to (6,4) or Left (L) to (5,3).\n- **Food at (5,4)**: It can be eaten in 2 moves (e.g., L then U, or U then L). Life span is 9, so it can be eaten up to turn 47. Eating it early scores +1 and grows the snake, but I must avoid traps.\n- **Risks**:\n  - Moving Left to (5,3) on turn 39 forces an immediate eat on turn 40 (U to (5,4)) to avoid death, as other moves from (5,3) lead to collision (all adjacent cells are body-occupied if not eating).\n  - Moving Up to (6,4) on turn 39 provides flexibility: I can eat on turn 40 (L to (5,4)) or explore upward for more space.\n- **Long-term Survival (5+ Turns)**:\n  - After eating at (5,4), the snake grows to 11 segments. Moving Down from (5,4) leads to a trap (e.g., at (5,2), all adjacent cells are occupied by turn 42, causing death).\n  - Moving Up from (5,4) to (5,5) opens more options (e.g., to (5,6), (4,5), or (6,5)), avoiding the body cluster and leveraging the less crowded top-right area.\n  - Delaying the eat (e.g., moving to (6,5) or beyond first) is possible but risky due to the body density; eating on turn 40 is efficient and safe with proper follow-up.\n- **Optimal Path**: \n  - Turn 39: Move U to (6,4) – avoids body cluster, gains flexibility.\n  - Turn 40: Move L to (5,4) – eats food (+1 score, length increases), safe with no tail danger (head not adjacent to tail).\n  - Turn 41: Move U to (5,5) – escapes potential traps, accesses open space for future moves.\n- **Why this sequence?** \n  - Turn 39 U ensures I don't get trapped in the body-dense left side. \n  - Turn 40 L eats the food immediately for score, and moving U afterward on turn 41 avoids the downward dead end. \n  - Post-turn 41, the top area (e.g., (5,6), (6,5)) has space for navigation, with the obstacle at (4,6) manageable.\n\n#### Simulated Turns (5 Turns Ahead):\n- **Turn 39**: Move U to (6,4). Head now at (6,4). Body shifts: tail (3,5) removed. New positions: [(6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)].\n- **Turn 40**: Move L to (5,4). Eat food at (5,4) (+1 score, length 11). Head now at (5,4). New positions: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)].\n- **Turn 41**: Move U to (5,5). No food, tail (4,5) removed. Head now at (5,5). New positions: [(5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)].\n- **Turn 42+**: From (5,5), moves include U to (5,6), L to (4,5), or R to (6,5), all safe. Further moves can explore open areas while monitoring food life spans.\n\nThis plan prioritizes survival by avoiding high-risk areas and secures the food reward efficiently.\n\n### Answer\n\\boxed{\nTurn 39: U \\\\\nTurn 40: L \\\\\nTurn 41: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but I need to confirm the coordinates. Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are inside. But there's an internal obstacle at (4,6), so that cell is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: head at (6,4), then (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). So the snake is 10 segments long. Head direction is U, which is up, so moving towards increasing y.\n\nFood:\n\n- (5,4) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (4,2) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n\nLife span means how many turns left before it disappears, including the current turn. So for (5,4), life span 8, so it will disappear after turn 40 + 7 = 47? Let's see: life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 40, life span is 8, meaning it has 8 turns left including turn 40. So it will be there until turn 40 + 7 = 47, and disappear at turn 48? I need to be careful.\n\nIf life span is N at turn t, it means:\n\n- At turn t, it exists, and life span decreases to N-1 for the next turn.\n\n- So after N turns, it will have life span 0 and disappear. So it exists from turn t to turn t + N - 1.\n\nFor example, at turn t, life span N: it exists at turn t, and at turn t+1, life span is N-1, down to turn t + N - 1 when life span is 1, then at turn t + N, it disappears.\n\nSo for (5,4) at turn 40, life span 8: exists from turn 40 to 47, disappears at turn 48.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) life span 10: exists from turn 40 to 49, disappears at turn 50.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid. I'll sketch a grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, but walls at x=0 and x=7, so playable x=1 to 6. Similarly y=1 to 6, but y=0 and y=7 walls.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), so (4,6) is blocked.\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (6,4)\n\nBody: (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nTail is (4,5)\n\nNow, head direction is U, so last move was up, from (6,3) to (6,4)? Positions: head is (6,4), and previous was (6,3), so since head direction is U, it must have moved from (6,3) to (6,4), so up.\n\nNow, possible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot do instant reverse. Since head direction is U, reverse would be D, so I cannot move down immediately. So possible moves: U, L, R. Not D.\n\nAlso, need to avoid walls and body collisions.\n\nCurrent head position: (6,4)\n\nMove up (U): to (6,5)\n\nMove left (L): to (5,4)\n\nMove right (R): to (7,4), but x=7 is wall, so invalid, collision.\n\nx=7 is wall, so moving right to (7,4) is not possible.\n\nSimilarly, down is not possible because of no instant reverse.\n\nSo only possible moves: U to (6,5) or L to (5,4)\n\nNow, let's see what's at those positions.\n\n(6,5): is this occupied? Snake positions: from (6,4) to (4,5), list: (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). So (6,5) is not occupied, and not wall. Walls are at borders, so (6,5) is within bounds, x=6, y=5, x=6 is not wall, x=7 is wall, so (6,5) is playable. y=5, not wall.\n\nInternal obstacles: only (4,6), so (6,5) is fine.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4): not in snake positions, not wall, and there's food at (5,4) with value 1.\n\nFood at (5,4) is present.\n\nSo if I move left to (5,4), I eat the food, since head moves there, and it's not under body? (5,4) is not occupied by snake body; snake is at (6,4), (6,3), etc., not at (5,4). So moving to (5,4) would eat the food, gain +1, and snake grows by one segment.\n\nBut I need to be careful about tail reward danger.\n\nTail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nFirst, what is the tail? Tail is at (4,5).\n\nIs head adjacent to tail? Head at (6,4), tail at (4,5). Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right.\n\n(6,4) to (4,5): difference in x: 2, y:1, so not adjacent; it's diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent would be like (5,4) or (6,5) or (6,3) or (5,4), etc.\n\n(6,4) and (4,5) are not adjacent; they are two steps away.\n\nSo no issue with tail reward danger here.\n\nIf I move to (5,4), I eat the food, snake grows, so new head at (5,4), and tail stays where it is? No, when snake eats, it grows, so after moving to (5,4), the head is at (5,4), and the body follows, so the tail moves only if no growth, but with growth, the tail doesn't move, so snake becomes 11 segments.\n\nPositions: new head at (5,4), then previous head (6,4) becomes body, then (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) – tail still at (4,5), but since we ate, we add a segment, so tail doesn't move, and we have a new segment at the position before tail or something? Standard snake: when you eat, you move to the food, and the tail doesn't advance, so length increases by one.\n\nSo after eating at (5,4): snake positions: head (5,4), then (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) – and since we ate, we add a new segment at the end, so tail is still (4,5), but now the segment before tail is (4,4), so the new segment is added, meaning the tail stays, and we have an extra body segment.\n\nInitial positions: 10 segments.\n\nAfter move to (5,4) and eat: head moves to (5,4), then the previous head (6,4) is now the second segment, and so on, down to the tail (4,5). Since we ate, we don't remove the tail; we keep it, so now 11 segments: (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), ..., (4,5) with (4,5) still there.\n\nTail position doesn't change immediately; the snake extends.\n\nNow, the other option: move up to (6,5).\n\nThen no food eaten, so snake moves: head to (6,5), then (6,4), (6,3), ..., and tail (4,5) is removed? When no eat, the tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed.\n\nIf I move to (6,5) without eating, head to (6,5), then (6,4) becomes body, (6,3) body, ..., down to (4,5) is tail, but since no growth, we remove the tail, so new positions: (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) – tail at (4,4).\n\nOriginal: 10 segments. After move, if no eat, head moves to new position, all segments shift, tail is removed. So new length 9? No: the snake has a fixed length unless it eats.\n\nSnake length increases only when it eats positive food.\n\nIn this case, if no eat, length same, so after move, head to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position, tail is removed.\n\nSo from 10 segments, after move without eat: 10 positions but head moves, so the last position (tail) is vacated.\n\nPositions: let’s say current: S0 = head (6,4), S1=(6,3), S2=(6,2), S3=(6,1), S4=(5,1), S5=(4,1), S6=(4,2), S7=(4,3), S8=(4,4), S9=(4,5) tail.\n\nIf move to (6,5) without eating: new head (6,5), then S0 moves to (6,5), S1 moves to old S0 position (6,4), S2 to (6,3), ..., S8 to (4,4), and S9 (tail) is removed, so new tail is old S8 position, but S8 was (4,4), which is now occupied by what was S8.\n\nNew positions: head (6,5), then body: (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) – so 9 segments, tail at (4,4).\n\nLength decreases only if no growth; since no eat, length remains same? No, length is fixed unless growth.\n\nInitial length 10. After move without eating, the snake moves, so it occupies a new head position and loses the tail position, so length is still 10? No.\n\nStandard: when snake moves without eating, it advances: head to new cell, each segment to previous segment's position, so the tail cell is left, and the new head is added, so length remains the same.\n\nIn terms of segments: the number of segments is constant when no eating.\n\nHere, 10 segments. After move, head to new position, say (6,5), then the segment that was head is now at position 1, and so on, down to segment 9 at old position 8, and segment 10 (tail) moves to old position 9, so the cell that was tail is vacated, but the snake still has 10 segments, just shifted.\n\nPositions: new head (6,5), then the previous positions from head to one before tail: (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) — that's 9 segments? Let's index.\n\nLet positions be P0 = head (6,4), P1 = (6,3), P2 = (6,2), P3 = (6,1), P4 = (5,1), P5 = (4,1), P6 = (4,2), P7 = (4,3), P8 = (4,4), P9 = (4,5) tail.\n\nAfter moving head to (6,5) without eating: new P0 = (6,5), new P1 = old P0 = (6,4), new P2 = old P1 = (6,3), new P3 = old P2 = (6,2), new P4 = old P3 = (6,1), new P5 = old P4 = (5,1), new P6 = old P5 = (4,1), new P7 = old P6 = (4,2), new P8 = old P7 = (4,3), new P9 = old P8 = (4,4). So tail at (4,4), and old P9 (4,5) is empty. Length still 10.\n\nBut in the list, we have from (6,5) to (4,4), which is 10 positions.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to (5,4) and eat, then new head at (5,4), then P1 = old P0 = (6,4), P2 = old P1 = (6,3), ..., P9 = old P8 = (4,4), and since ate, we add a new segment at the tail, so P10 = old P9 = (4,5), so now 11 segments: (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5).\n\nTail is at (4,5).\n\nBack to the decision.\n\nAt turn 40, I can move U to (6,5) or L to (5,4).\n\nIf I move L to (5,4), I eat the food at (5,4), gain +1, snake grows to 11.\n\nIf I move U to (6,5), no eat, snake moves, tail at (4,4) now.\n\nBut I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n\nAlso, there's another food at (4,2), but it's under the body? Food at (4,2), and in snake positions, (4,2) is a body segment.\n\nLook at positions: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) — so (4,2) is occupied by the snake body.\n\nFood at (4,2) with value 1, but it's under the body.\n\nAccording to rules, food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves onto it.\n\nSo currently, (4,2) is occupied, so I cannot eat it now. I need to move the snake so that the body leaves (4,2), then later head can move there to eat.\n\nSimilarly, the food at (5,4) is free, not under body.\n\nNow, life span: (5,4) life 8, so available for 8 more turns, from turn 40 to 47.\n\n(4,2) life 10, available to turn 49.\n\nBut (4,2) is under body, so I need to free it first.\n\nCurrent head at (6,4), direction U.\n\nOptions: U or L.\n\nIf I move L to (5,4), I eat the food, grow to 11, head now at (5,4), direction L (since I moved left).\n\nThen the snake is at (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5).\n\nFood at (4,2) is still under body, at segment position? Let's see indices: head (5,4), then P1=(6,4), P2=(6,3), P3=(6,2), P4=(6,1), P5=(5,1), P6=(4,1), P7=(4,2), P8=(4,3), P9=(4,4), P10=(4,5).\n\nSo (4,2) is P7, a body segment.\n\nTo eat the food at (4,2), I need the body to move away from there, so that the cell is free, then head can move to it.\n\nSince the snake moves, eventually the segment at (4,2) will move when the snake advances, but only if no growth; if I don't eat, it will move.\n\nFor example, if I don't eat for a while, the tail will move, and the body segments shift.\n\nSpecifically, at (4,2), it is currently occupied. When the snake moves without eating, each segment moves to the next position, so the segment that was at (4,2) will move to where the next segment was, but since positions shift, let's think.\n\nSuppose I move several times without eating. Each time, the head moves to a new cell, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n\nSo for the cell (4,2), it is currently occupied by a segment. When that segment moves (because the snake advances), it will leave (4,2), and if no other segment is there, it becomes free. Then, if later the head moves to (4,2), I can eat the food.\n\nBut the food is there, so when the body leaves, the food becomes accessible.\n\nThen head can move there to eat.\n\nBut I need to plan a path.\n\nFirst, let's consider the two choices at turn 40.\n\nOption 1: Move L to (5,4) and eat.\n\nThen turn 40: action L\n\nNew head position: (5,4), direction L (since moved left from (6,4))\n\nSnake length 11.\n\nNow, possible moves from (5,4): cannot reverse to R, since last move was L, so reverse is R, not allowed. So can move U, D, L.\n\nU to (5,5), D to (5,3), L to (4,4).\n\nNow, check if valid:\n\n(5,5): not wall, not occupied? Current snake: (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), etc., (4,4) is in snake, but (5,5) is not in positions, so free.\n\n(5,3): similarly, not occupied.\n\n(4,4): (4,4) is part of snake, P9 in new positions? Positions: head (5,4), P1=(6,4), P2=(6,3), P3=(6,2), P4=(6,1), P5=(5,1), P6=(4,1), P7=(4,2), P8=(4,3), P9=(4,4), P10=(4,5)\n\nSo (4,4) is P9, occupied, so cannot move to (4,4).\n\nSimilarly, walls: (5,3) is within bounds, (5,5) within, (4,4) occupied.\n\nSo from (5,4), can move U to (5,5), D to (5,3), or L to (4,4) but (4,4) occupied, invalid. L to (4,4) is left, from (5,4) to (4,4), x-1.\n\nBut (4,4) is occupied, so collision, cannot.\n\nSo only U or D.\n\nNow, (5,5) and (5,3).\n\nAlso, no food at these positions.\n\nFood is at (4,2) and (5,4) is eaten.\n\n(4,2) is still under body.\n\nOption 2: Move U to (6,5) at turn 40.\n\nThen no eat, snake moves: head to (6,5), then body: (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), tail at (4,4)? Earlier calculation.\n\nAfter move U to (6,5) without eating:\n\nNew positions: head (6,5), P1=(6,4), P2=(6,3), P3=(6,2), P4=(6,1), P5=(5,1), P6=(4,1), P7=(4,2), P8=(4,3), P9=(4,4)  // P9 is tail, at (4,4)\n\nLength 10.\n\nFood at (5,4) is still there, not eaten.\n\nFood at (4,2) is under body, at P7.\n\nHead direction now U.\n\nPossible next moves from (6,5): since moved U, cannot D. So U, L, R.\n\nU to (6,6): y=6, but walls at y=7, y=0, so y=6 is playable? y from 1 to 6, y=7 wall, so y=6 is within bounds. But internal obstacle at (4,6), but (6,6) is different.\n\n(6,6): not wall, not occupied currently? Snake at (6,5), (6,4), etc., not (6,6), so free.\n\nL to (5,5): free.\n\nR to (7,5): x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo can move U to (6,6) or L to (5,5).\n\nNow, (5,4) has food, but not adjacent to head; head at (6,5), (5,4) is below-left.\n\nTo eat (5,4), I need to move to it, but from (6,5), I can only go to (6,6) or (5,5), not directly to (5,4).\n\nFrom (6,5), moving D is reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo I cannot eat (5,4) immediately next turn if I go to (6,5).\n\nBut I can go to (5,5), then from there, I might go down to (5,4).\n\nBut let's think long-term.\n\nI need to maximize score, so I should eat both foods if possible.\n\nFood at (4,2) is under body, so I need to free it first.\n\nThe body at (4,2) will move when the snake advances.\n\nCurrently, at turn 40, snake positions include (4,2) as a body segment.\n\nWhen the snake moves without eating, the segments shift.\n\nFor example, if I never eat, after 10 moves, the tail would have moved, and (4,2) might be free.\n\nBut with possible eating, it changes.\n\nThe segment at (4,2) is at index depending on the position.\n\nIn the initial state, (4,2) is the 6th segment? Positions: head (6,4) index 0, (6,3)1, (6,2)2, (6,1)3, (5,1)4, (4,1)5, (4,2)6, (4,3)7, (4,4)8, (4,5)9.\n\nSo (4,2) is index 6.\n\nWhen the snake moves without eating, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the segment that was at (4,2) will move to where the segment ahead was, but since the head moves, the positions shift.\n\nAfter one move without eating, head moves to new position, P1 to old P0, P2 to old P1, ..., P9 to old P8.\n\nSo the segment that was at index 6 ( (4,2) ) will move to old P5 position, which is (4,1) if P5 was (4,1), let's see.\n\nOld positions: P0=(6,4), P1=(6,3), P2=(6,2), P3=(6,1), P4=(5,1), P5=(4,1), P6=(4,2), P7=(4,3), P8=(4,4), P9=(4,5)\n\nAfter move, new head to say (6,5), then new P1 = old P0 = (6,4), new P2 = old P1 = (6,3), new P3 = old P2 = (6,2), new P4 = old P3 = (6,1), new P5 = old P4 = (5,1), new P6 = old P5 = (4,1), new P7 = old P6 = (4,2), new P8 = old P7 = (4,3), new P9 = old P8 = (4,4)\n\nSo the segment that was at (4,2) (old P6) is now at new P7, which is (4,2) again? new P7 = old P6 = (4,2), so it stays at (4,2)? No:\n\nnew P7 is the position, but the segment: the segment that was at old P6 is now at new P7 position, which is old P6 position (4,2), but since it moved to old P5 position? Let's clarify.\n\nThe position new P6 is old P5, which is (4,1)\n\nnew P7 is old P6, which is (4,2)\n\nSo the cell (4,2) is now occupied by new P7, which is the segment that was previously at old P6, so (4,2) is still occupied by the same segment? No, the segment moves.\n\nThe segment that was at old P6 is now at new P7 position, which is (4,2) if old P6 was (4,2), so it stays at (4,2)? That can't be right.\n\nExample: suppose head at (0,0), body at (0,1), tail at (0,2). If move up to (0,-1)? Better: head (1,1), body (1,2), tail (1,3). If move up to (1,0), then new body: (1,1), new tail (1,2). So the cell (1,3) is free, (1,2) now has tail.\n\nIn general, when snake moves, the tail cell is left, and all segments shift forward.\n\nFor cell (4,2): in old positions, it was occupied by P6.\n\nAfter move, P6 moves to new position, which is old P5 position (4,1), and new P7 is at old P6 position (4,2), but new P7 is the segment that was at old P6, so the segment that was at (4,2) is now at (4,1), and the cell (4,2) is now occupied by the segment that was at old P7, which was (4,3), so it's a different segment.\n\nBut the point is, the cell (4,2) may still be occupied or not, depending on the move.\n\nIn this case, after one move without eating, new P7 is at (4,2), so (4,2) is still occupied by a body segment.\n\nSimilarly, only when the tail moves away from a position, it becomes free.\n\nIn this case, the tail was at (4,5), after move, tail at (4,4), so (4,5) is free, but (4,2) is still occupied.\n\nTo free (4,2), I need the segment that is there to move, and no other segment to be there, which will happen when that segment is close to the tail and the tail moves.\n\nSince (4,2) is index 6 in a 10-segment snake, it will take 6 moves for that segment to become the tail, I think.\n\nThe distance from head to that segment is 6 steps, so after 6 moves without eating, that segment will be the head or something? Let's think.\n\nThe segment at index k will become the tail after (L - k) moves without eating, where L is length.\n\nHere L=10, k=6 for (4,2), so after 10-6=4 moves without eating, the segment at index 6 will be at the tail position and will move away.\n\nInitial: indices 0 to 9.\n\nAfter one move without eating: new positions, the segment that was at index 0 is now head at new position, segment at index 1 is at old index 0 position, ..., segment at index 9 is at old index 8 position.\n\nThe segment that was at index i is now at index i in the new list, but at the position of old index i-1 for i>0.\n\nAfter m moves without eating, the segment that was at index i is now at index i, but the positions have shifted.\n\nThe cell that was occupied by index j will be free after m moves when the tail has moved past it.\n\nFor a fixed cell, it will be free when the segment that was there has moved and no other segment is there.\n\nFor (4,2), it is currently occupied by the segment at index 6.\n\nAfter one move, that segment moves to the position of old index 5, which is (4,1), and (4,2) is now occupied by the segment that was at index 7, old (4,3).\n\nAfter two moves, the segment from index 7 moves to old index 6 position, etc.\n\nAfter 4 moves, the segment that was at index 6 will be at the position of old index 2 or something, but the cell (4,2) will be occupied until the tail was at (4,5), and after 4 moves, the tail might be elsewhere.\n\nSince the snake is moving, and (4,2) is part of the body, it will be occupied until that part of the body moves away, which happens when the snake head moves in a way that the body segment at (4,2) advances.\n\nSpecifically, after 4 moves without eating, the segment that was at index 6 will be at index 6, but since the head has moved 4 times, the positions are different, and index 6 will be closer to the tail.\n\nInitial length 10.\n\nAfter m moves without eating, the segment that was at index k is now at index k, but the tail is at index 9.\n\nAfter m moves, the segment that was at index k is now at index k, and the distance to tail is 9-k.\n\nWhen the distance to tail is 0, it becomes tail and moves next turn.\n\nFor the cell to be free, we need the segment to leave and no one to replace it.\n\nThe cell (4,2) will be free when the segment that was there has moved and the new occupant has not arrived, but since segments move sequentially, it might not be free immediately.\n\nIn practice, for a straight line, when the tail moves off a cell, it becomes free, but for a cell in the middle, it is always occupied until the tail passes that point.\n\nIn this case, the snake has a bend, but for (4,2), it is between (4,1) and (4,3), so it's on a straight line.\n\nAfter m moves without eating, the tail will be at the position that was m steps from the tail.\n\nAfter m moves, the position that was at index 9-m is now the tail.\n\nFor example, after 1 move, tail at old P8 position.\n\nAfter 2 moves, tail at old P7 position, and so on.\n\nThe cell (4,2) was at index 6, so it will be the tail when 9- m = 6, so m=3.\n\nAfter 3 moves without eating, the tail will be at the position that was index 6, which is (4,2).\n\nThen on the next move, when the snake moves, the tail leaves (4,2), so (4,2) becomes free.\n\nSo after 3 moves without eating, (4,2) will be freed on the 4th move when the tail moves away.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nTurn 40: positions as given.\n\nAfter turn 40 move without eating: say we move U to (6,5), new positions: head (6,5), P1=(6,4), P2=(6,3), P3=(6,2), P4=(6,1), P5=(5,1), P6=(4,1), P7=(4,2), P8=(4,3), P9=(4,4)\n\n(4,2) is P7.\n\nAfter turn 41 move without eating: say move U to (6,6), new head (6,6), P1=(6,5), P2=(6,4), P3=(6,3), P4=(6,2), P5=(6,1), P6=(5,1), P7=(4,1), P8=(4,2), P9=(4,3)\n\n(4,2) is P8.\n\nAfter turn 42 move without eating: say move L to (5,6), but (5,6) may be available, new head (5,6), P1=(6,6), P2=(6,5), P3=(6,4), P4=(6,3), P5=(6,2), P6=(6,1), P7=(5,1), P8=(4,1), P9=(4,2)\n\n(4,2) is P9, tail.\n\nThen on turn 43, if move without eating, head moves somewhere, tail moves from (4,2) to old P8 position (4,1), so (4,2) is freed.\n\nSo on turn 43, after the move, (4,2) is free and has food.\n\nThen I can move head to (4,2) to eat, if possible.\n\nBut I need to see the head position at that time.\n\nIn this simulation, at turn 42, head at (5,6), tail at (4,2).\n\nThen on turn 43, I can move to (4,2) if adjacent and possible.\n\n(5,6) to (4,2) is not adjacent; (4,2) is left and down, not adjacent.\n\nFrom (5,6), possible moves: U to (5,7) but y=7 wall, invalid; D to (5,5); L to (4,6) but (4,6) is internal obstacle, wall; R to (6,6) but may be body.\n\nAt turn 42 positions: head (5,6), P1=(6,6), P2=(6,5), etc., down to P9=(4,2)\n\nSo (4,6) is wall, so from (5,6), can move D to (5,5) or R to (6,6) but (6,6) is P1, occupied, or U invalid, L invalid, so only D to (5,5).\n\nThen on turn 43, move D to (5,5), then new positions: head (5,5), P1=(5,6), P2=(6,6), P3=(6,5), ..., down to P8=(4,1), P9=(4,2)? After move, new P9 = old P8 = (4,1), so tail at (4,1), and (4,2) is free.\n\nBut head at (5,5), not adjacent to (4,2).\n\n(4,2) is at (4,2), head at (5,5), not adjacent.\n\nTo eat (4,2), I need to be adjacent and move to it.\n\nFrom (5,5), I can move L to (4,5) or D to (5,4) or U to (5,6) but occupied, or R to (6,5) occupied.\n\nSo possible L to (4,5) or D to (5,4), neither is (4,2).\n\n(4,2) is two steps away.\n\nIt might take more turns to reach it.\n\nThis is getting messy.\n\nI should consider not eating the food at (5,4) now, so that I can free (4,2) faster and eat it, but (5,4) has short life span.\n\nLife span of (5,4) is 8, so it disappears at turn 48, but exists up to turn 47.\n\nTurn 40 to 47.\n\nIf I don't eat it soon, I might lose it.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) life span 10, up to turn 49.\n\nBut (4,2) is under body, so I need to free it first.\n\nIf I eat (5,4) now, the snake grows to 11, so it will take longer to free (4,2) because the body is longer.\n\nLet's compare.\n\nFirst, if I eat (5,4) at turn 40:\n\nThen snake length 11.\n\n(4,2) is at index 7 in the new positions? After eating at (5,4), positions: head (5,4), P1=(6,4), P2=(6,3), P3=(6,2), P4=(6,1), P5=(5,1), P6=(4,1), P7=(4,2), P8=(4,3), P9=(4,4), P10=(4,5)\n\nSo (4,2) is P7.\n\nDistance to tail: 10 - 7 = 3, so after 3 moves without eating, P7 will be the tail.\n\nAfter 3 moves without eating, tail at old P7 position.\n\nThen on the 4th move, tail moves away.\n\nBut with growth, it's different.\n\nIf I don't eat after that, after m moves, the segment at P7 will move towards tail.\n\nAfter 3 moves without eating, the segment that was P7 will be at index 10, tail.\n\nThen on next move, it moves away.\n\nBut during that time, I need to have the head near (4,2) to eat it.\n\nBut it might be complicated.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid eating (5,4) now so that I can free (4,2) sooner and eat both foods.\n\nLet's see the grid.\n\nI am at (6,4), food at (5,4), which is left.\n\nIf I move L to (5,4), I eat it, grow.\n\nThen I am at (5,4), with possible moves U or D, as L and R are invalid or reverse.\n\nFrom (5,4), after eating, head at (5,4), direction L.\n\nCan move U to (5,5) or D to (5,3).\n\nSay I move U to (5,5).\n\nThen turn 41: U to (5,5), no eat, snake moves: head (5,5), P1=(5,4), P2=(6,4), etc., down to P10=(4,4) or something.\n\nPositions: after turn 40 eat at (5,4), positions as above.\n\nAfter turn 41 move U to (5,5): new head (5,5), P1= old P0 = (5,4), P2= old P1 = (6,4), P3= old P2 = (6,3), P4= (6,2), P5= (6,1), P6= (5,1), P7= (4,1), P8= (4,2), P9= (4,3), P10= (4,4)  // P10 tail at (4,4)\n\n(4,2) is P8.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut (4,2) is still occupied.\n\nIf I move D to (5,3) from (5,4).\n\n(5,3) is free, no food.\n\nThen similar.\n\nBut to free (4,2), with length 11, it takes more moves.\n\nIf I don't eat at turn 40, move U to (6,5).\n\nThen at turn 40: move U to (6,5), no eat, positions: head (6,5), P1=(6,4), P2=(6,3), P3=(6,2), P4=(6,1), P5=(5,1), P6=(4,1), P7=(4,2), P8=(4,3), P9=(4,4)\n\n(4,2) is P7.\n\nDistance to tail 9-7=2, so after 2 moves without eating, P7 will be tail.\n\nAfter 2 moves: after turn 40 move to (6,5).\n\nTurn 41: say I move U to (6,6), new head (6,6), P1=(6,5), P2=(6,4), P3=(6,3), P4=(6,2), P5=(6,1), P6=(5,1), P7=(4,1), P8=(4,2), P9=(4,3)  // P9 tail at (4,3), (4,2) is P8.\n\nAfter turn 42: move L to (5,6), new head (5,6), P1=(6,6), P2=(6,5), P3=(6,4), P4=(6,3), P5=(6,2), P6=(6,1), P7=(5,1), P8=(4,1), P9=(4,2)  // P9 tail at (4,2)\n\nThen on turn 43, if I move, say D to (5,5), new head (5,5), P1=(5,6), P2=(6,6), P3=(6,5), ..., P8=(4,1), P9=(4,2) but P9 moves to old P8 position (4,1), so tail at (4,1), and (4,2) is free.\n\nFood at (4,2) is now free.\n\nHead at (5,5), which is not adjacent to (4,2).\n\nFrom (5,5), I can move to (4,5) or (5,4) or (6,5) etc.\n\n(4,2) is at (4,2), so I need to go to (4,3) or (5,2) or (4,1) or (3,2), but (3,2) may be out of bound or something.\n\nx from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\n(4,2) has neighbors: (4,1), (4,3), (5,2), (3,2).\n\n(4,1) and (4,3) may be occupied or not.\n\nAt turn 43 after move to (5,5), positions: head (5,5), P1=(5,6), P2=(6,6), P3=(6,5), P4=(6,4), P5=(6,3), P6=(6,2), P7=(6,1), P8=(5,1), P9=(4,1)  // tail at (4,1)\n\n(4,2) is free.\n\nSo to eat (4,2), I need to move head to it from adjacent cell.\n\nFrom current head (5,5), I can move to (4,5) or (5,4) or (6,5) or (5,6), but (6,5) is P3, occupied, (5,6) is P1, occupied, so only (4,5) or (5,4).\n\n(4,5): not occupied, free.\n\n(5,4): may have food, but at turn 43, food at (5,4) life span 8, from turn 40, so at turn 43, life span 8-3=5, still there.\n\nTurn 40 life span 8, turn 41 life span 7, turn 42 life span 6, turn 43 life span 5, so yes.\n\nFrom (5,5), move to (4,5) or (5,4).\n\nIf I move to (4,5), then head at (4,5), not adjacent to (4,2).\n\nThen from there, I can move down to (4,4) or left to (3,5), etc.\n\nBut (4,2) is at y=2, so I need to go down.\n\nIf I move to (5,4) from (5,5), then head at (5,4), which is adjacent to (4,4), (5,5), (6,4), (5,3).\n\n(4,2) is not adjacent.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can move down to (5,3), then to (5,2) or (4,3), then to (4,2).\n\nBut (4,3) might be occupied or not.\n\nAt turn 43, after move to (5,5), positions as above, (4,3) is not in positions, so free.\n\nPositions: (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1) so (4,3) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) free.\n\nSo from (5,4), I can move to (4,4) or (5,3) or (6,4) or (5,5), but (6,4) occupied, (5,5) occupied, so from (5,4), can move to (4,4) or (5,3).\n\nThen to reach (4,2), I need to go to (4,3) or (5,2) etc.\n\nIt might take a few turns.\n\nBut food at (5,4) is still there, so if I move to (5,4) at turn 43, I can eat it.\n\nBut let's think from the beginning.\n\nPerhaps it's better not to eat (5,4) at turn 40, so that I can free (4,2) faster and eat it, and also have a chance to eat (5,4) later if possible.\n\nBut (5,4) has shorter life, so I might lose it if I delay.\n\nAt turn 40, if I move U to (6,5), then at turn 41, I can move L to (5,5), for example.\n\nFrom (6,5), move L to (5,5).\n\nThen positions: head (5,5), P1=(6,5), P2=(6,4), P3=(6,3), P4=(6,2), P5=(6,1), P6=(5,1), P7=(4,1), P8=(4,2), P9=(4,3)\n\n(4,2) is P8.\n\nThen at turn 42, I can move D to (5,4), for example, to eat the food at (5,4).\n\nFrom (5,5), move D to (5,4), which has food, so eat it.\n\nThen new head at (5,4), and snake grows to 11.\n\nPositions: after eating at (5,4), head (5,4), P1= old P0 = (5,5), P2= old P1 = (6,5), P3= (6,4), P4= (6,3), P5= (6,2), P6= (6,1), P7= (5,1), P8= (4,1), P9= (4,2), P10= (4,3)  // P10 tail at (4,3)\n\n(4,2) is P9, so not tail yet.\n\nTo free (4,2), it will take more moves.\n\nBut at least I ate (5,4) at turn 42.\n\nThen (4,2) is at P9, so after 1 move without eating, P9 will be tail.\n\nAfter turn 42 eat at (5,4), positions as above.\n\nTurn 43: say move L to (4,4), but (4,4) may be occupied? Positions have P10 at (4,3), (4,4) not in list, so free.\n\nMove L to (4,4), no food there, so no eat, snake moves: new head (4,4), P1= (5,4), P2= (5,5), P3= (6,5), P4= (6,4), P5= (6,3), P6= (6,2), P7= (6,1), P8= (5,1), P9= (4,1), P10= (4,2)  // P10 tail at (4,2)\n\nThen on turn 44, if move, tail moves from (4,2) to old P9 position (4,1), so (4,2) freed.\n\nHead at (4,4), which is adjacent to (4,3), (4,5), (3,4), (5,4).\n\n(4,2) is below, so I can move down to (4,3) or directly to (4,2) if possible, but from (4,4), move D to (4,3), but at turn 44, before move, positions have P10 at (4,2), so (4,3) is not occupied? Positions at turn 43 after move: head (4,4), P1=(5,4), P2=(5,5), P3=(6,5), P4=(6,4), P5=(6,3), P6=(6,2), P7=(6,1), P8=(5,1), P9=(4,1), P10=(4,2)\n\nSo (4,3) is free.\n\nFrom (4,4), I can move D to (4,3), then from there to (4,2) next turn.\n\nAt turn 44, after move to (4,3) or something.\n\nAt turn 44, before move, head at (4,4), I can move D to (4,3), which is free, no food.\n\nThen new positions: head (4,3), P1=(4,4), P2=(5,4), P3=(5,5), etc., down to P10=(4,2)? After move, new P1= old P0 = (4,4), new P2= old P1 = (5,4), ..., new P10= old P9 = (4,1), and old P10 (4,2) is left, so (4,2) free with food.\n\nBut head at (4,3), which is adjacent to (4,2), so on turn 45, I can move D to (4,2) and eat the food.\n\nYes.\n\nSo in this scenario:\n\nTurn 40: move U to (6,5)\n\nTurn 41: move L to (5,5)\n\nTurn 42: move D to (5,4) and eat (5,4)\n\nTurn 43: move L to (4,4)  // or other, but in this case to (4,4)\n\nTurn 44: move D to (4,3)\n\nTurn 45: move D to (4,2) and eat (4,2)\n\nThen I ate both foods.\n\nAt turn 40, if I move L to (5,4) and eat immediately, then I need to free (4,2) with longer snake.\n\nAfter turn 40 eat at (5,4), positions: head (5,4), body to (4,5)\n\n(4,2) is P7.\n\nTo make P7 the tail, need to move without eating for 3 times, since distance 3.\n\nAfter 3 moves, it will be tail.\n\nThen on 4th move, it leaves.\n\nBut during those moves, I can position the head.\n\nBut it might be similar or take more turns.\n\nFor example, after turn 40 eat at (5,4), say turn 41 move U to (5,5), positions as before.\n\nTurn 42 move U to (5,6), but (5,6) may be available, new head (5,6), P1=(5,5), P2=(5,4), P3=(6,4), ..., down to P10=(4,4)\n\n(4,2) is P7, now at new position.\n\nAfter turn 41 move U to (5,5), positions: head (5,5), P1=(5,4), P2=(6,4), P3=(6,3), P4=(6,2), P5=(6,1), P6=(5,1), P7=(4,1), P8=(4,2), P9=(4,3), P10=(4,4)\n\n(4,2) is P8.\n\nAfter turn 42 move U to (5,6), new head (5,6), P1=(5,5), P2=(5,4), P3=(6,4), P4=(6,3), P5=(6,2), P6=(6,1), P7=(5,1), P8=(4,1), P9=(4,2), P10=(4,3)  // (4,2) P9\n\nAfter turn 43 move, say L to (4,6), but (4,6) wall, invalid. From (5,6), can move D to (5,5) but occupied, or L to (4,6) wall, or R to (6,6), if free.\n\n(6,6) may be free, move R to (6,6), new head (6,6), P1=(5,6), P2=(5,5), P3=(5,4), P4=(6,4), P5=(6,3), P6=(6,2), P7=(6,1), P8=(5,1), P9=(4,1), P10=(4,2)  // P10 tail at (4,2)\n\nThen turn 44, move, tail moves from (4,2), freed.\n\nHead at (6,6), far from (4,2), need to go back.\n\nThen to eat (4,2), it might take more turns, and (5,4) is already eaten.\n\nBut I can eat (4,2) later, but it might be risky or inefficient.\n\nIn the first plan, I eat both by turn 45.\n\nIn the second, if I eat (5,4) early, I might eat (4,2) later but with more moves.\n\nAlso, in the first plan, I ate (5,4) at turn 42, before it disappears.\n\nLife span 8, turn 40 to 47, so turn 42 is fine.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) life 10, turn 40 to 49, turn 45 fine.\n\nMoreover, in the first plan, I avoided the immediate eat, which might be better for freeing (4,2).\n\nNow, about the head direction and no instant reverse.\n\nIn the first plan:\n\nTurn 40: from (6,4) direction U, move U to (6,5), now direction U.\n\nTurn 41: from (6,5) direction U, move L to (5,5), now direction L (left).\n\nTurn 42: from (5,5) direction L, move D to (5,4). Now, moving from (5,5) to (5,4) is down, which is not reverse of left? Reverse of left is right, down is perpendicular, so allowed. Direction now D.\n\nThen at (5,4), eat food.\n\nTurn 43: from (5,4) direction D, can move L to (4,4) or U to (5,5) or D to (5,3), etc. Move L to (4,4), direction L.\n\nTurn 44: from (4,4) direction L, move D to (4,3). Moving down, perpendicular, allowed. Direction D.\n\nTurn 45: from (4,3) direction D, move D to (4,2), eat food.\n\nAll moves valid.\n\nI need to output actions for multiple turns, but the state is at turn 40, and I need to think ahead, but output actions starting from turn 40.\n\nThe answer should be a sequence of actions for turns 40,41,42,... but I don't know how many, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide a sequence for at least 5 turns or until a decision point.\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t1: action ...\" for several turns.\n\nBut in this case, I have a plan up to turn 45.\n\nBut turn 45 is eating (4,2), so after that, I need to continue, but I can stop after eating both or something.\n\nThe goal is to maximize score, so I should keep playing, but for the answer, I think providing the actions for the next few turns is fine.\n\nSince the food at (4,2) is under body, and I need to free it, my plan above seems good.\n\nNow, at turn 40, if I move L to (5,4), I eat immediately, but then with longer snake, freeing (4,2) takes longer, and I might not be able to eat (4,2) if I move away.\n\nFor example, after eating at (5,4), if I move U to (5,5), then to (5,6), etc., I go up, while (4,2) is down, so I might not reach it in time or with difficulty.\n\nWhereas in the other plan, I stay in the area.\n\nMoreover, there might be risks.\n\nAnother thing: tail reward danger.\n\nIn the eating of (4,2), when I move to (4,2) at turn 45, what is the tail?\n\nIn the plan, at turn 45, before move, head at (4,3), tail at? From turn 44: after turn 44 move D to (4,3), positions: head (4,3), P1=(4,4), P2=(5,4), P3=(5,5), P4=(6,5), P5=(6,4), P6=(6,3), P7=(6,2), P8=(6,1), P9=(5,1), P10=(4,1) or something, tail at (4,1).\n\n(4,2) is free with food.\n\nHead at (4,3), move D to (4,2), eat.\n\nIs head adjacent to tail? Tail at (4,1), head at (4,3), not adjacent; (4,2) is between, but head moving to (4,2), tail at (4,1), after eating, the new tail will be at (4,1), head at (4,2), so they are adjacent vertically, but not colliding because head is at (4,2), tail at (4,1), different cells, so no collision.\n\nCollision is when head touches body, not necessarily tail unless same cell.\n\nAfter eating, head at (4,2), and tail at (4,1), no collision.\n\nSo safe.\n\nTherefore, the plan to move U at turn 40 seems better to allow eating both foods.\n\nIf I move L at turn 40, I eat (5,4) but then I have a longer snake and (4,2) might be harder to eat.\n\nMoreover, with internal obstacle at (4,6), but in the plan, I didn't go there.\n\nSo I think moving U at turn 40 is preferable.\n\nThen actions:\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: L (to (5,5))\n\nIn turn 41, from (6,5), I moved L to (5,5)\n\nThen turn 42: D to (5,4)\n\nThen turn 43: L to (4,4)\n\nBut from (5,4), after eating, I moved L to (4,4)\n\nThen turn 44: D to (4,3)\n\nTurn 45: D to (4,2)\n\nI need to specify for at least the next turns.\n\nSince the answer format might expect a sequence, I can provide from turn 40 to, say, turn 44 or 45.\n\nBut let's confirm the grid.\n\nAnother point: at turn 42, when I move to (5,4), I eat the food, so score +1.\n\nSimilarly at turn 45, eat (4,2), +1.\n\nNow, after that, I can continue, but for the answer, I think up to turn 45 is fine.\n\nPerhaps I should output actions for 5 turns: turn 40 to 44.\n\nBut at turn 44, I move to (4,3), not eating yet.\n\nIn the sequence, I can include until turn 45.\n\nThe state is turn 40, so actions for turn 40,41,42,etc.\n\nI think providing 5 actions is reasonable.\n\nSo for turn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: L (to (5,5))\n\nTurn 42: D (to (5,4), eat)\n\nTurn 43: L (to (4,4))\n\nTurn 44: D (to (4,3))\n\nThen implicitly, turn 45: D to (4,2) eat.\n\nBut in the answer, I need to write the actions.\n\nIn turn 43, from (5,4), I moved L to (4,4), but is (4,4) free? At that time, positions: after turn 42 eat at (5,4), positions: head (5,4), P1=(5,5), P2=(6,5), P3=(6,4), P4=(6,3), P5=(6,2), P6=(6,1), P7=(5,1), P8=(4,1), P9=(4,2), P10=(4,3) // tail at (4,3)\n\nSo (4,4) is free, yes.\n\nMove L to (4,4), no food, so no eat.\n\nThen positions after: head (4,4), P1=(5,4), P2=(5,5), P3=(6,5), etc., P10=(4,2)? After move, new head (4,4), P1= old P0 = (5,4), P2= old P1 = (5,5), P3= old P2 = (6,5), P4= old P3 = (6,4), ..., P10= old P9 = (4,2)\n\nTail at (4,2).\n\nThen turn 44 move D to (4,3): from (4,4) to (4,3), which is down.\n\n(4,3) may be occupied? Before move, positions have P10 at (4,2), so (4,3) is free.\n\nMove to (4,3), no food, so new positions: head (4,3), P1=(4,4), P2=(5,4), P3=(5,5), ..., P10= old P9 = (4,2)? old P9 is (4,2), but new P10 = old P9 = (4,2), but (4,2) has food, but we didn't move to it, so no eat.\n\nNew positions: head (4,3), P1= (4,4), P2= (5,4), P3= (5,5), P4= (6,5), P5= (6,4), P6= (6,3), P7= (6,2), P8= (6,1), P9= (5,1), P10= (4,1)  // since old P10 was (4,3)? Old positions before turn 44 move: head (4,4), P1=(5,4), P2=(5,5), P3=(6,5), P4=(6,4), P5=(6,3), P6=(6,2), P7=(6,1), P8=(5,1), P9=(4,1), P10=(4,2)\n\nAfter move to (4,3): new head (4,3), P1= old P0 = (4,4), P2= old P1 = (5,4), P3= old P2 = (5,5), ..., P10= old P9 = (4,1)\n\nAnd old P10 (4,2) is left, free with food.\n\nThen head at (4,3), adjacent to (4,2), so move D to (4,2) to eat.\n\nAll good.\n\nTherefore, for the answer, I can provide:\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: L\n\nTurn 42: D\n\nTurn 43: L\n\nTurn 44: D\n\nAnd then turn 45 would be D to eat (4,2), but since 5 turns, up to turn 44 is fine.\n\nThe state is turn 40, so actions for turn 40 to 44.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 42: D to (5,4) and eat, which is good.\n\nNow, to write in the boxed format.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, the AI must prioritize eating both available positive foods: (5,4) with a life span of 8 (available until turn 47) and (4,2) with a life span of 10 (available until turn 49). However, (4,2) is currently under the snake's body and can only be eaten once the body moves away. Eating (5,4) immediately at turn 40 is possible but would increase the snake's length to 11, making it harder to free (4,2) quickly. Instead, a sequence is planned to first free (4,2) by moving without eating for a few turns, then eat (5,4) at turn 42, and finally eat (4,2) at turn 45. This approach avoids unnecessary risks and leverages the snake's movement to clear the body from (4,2).\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Current State (Turn 40)**:\n  - Snake head at (6,4), direction U (up).\n  - Possible moves: U (to (6,5)) or L (to (5,4)); R is invalid (wall at x=7), D is invalid (instant reverse).\n  - Moving L eats (5,4) immediately but grows the snake, delaying access to (4,2).\n  - Moving U avoids immediate growth, allowing faster freeing of (4,2) and setting up for both foods.\n- **Freeing (4,2)**: (4,2) is under the body at index 6 (0-based). With snake length 10, it takes 3 moves without eating to make this segment the tail, freeing the cell on the 4th move.\n- **Eating Sequence**:\n  - At turn 42, eat (5,4) before it expires (life span 5 remaining).\n  - At turn 45, eat (4,2) with life span 5 remaining.\n- **Risk Avoidance**: \n  - No wall or body collisions in the path.\n  - Tail reward danger is avoided: when eating (4,2) at turn 45, head and tail are not adjacent.\n  - All moves respect no-instant-reverse rule.\n- **5+ Turn Plan**: The sequence below covers turns 40-44, with turn 45 implied to eat (4,2). Thinking beyond turn 45, the snake can continue safely, but the focus is on securing both foods.\n\n### Planned Actions (Turns 40-44):\n- **Turn 40**: Move U (up) to (6,5).  \n  Why: Avoids eating (5,4) now to keep snake shorter for faster freeing of (4,2). Head direction changes to U.\n- **Turn 41**: Move L (left) to (5,5).  \n  Why: Positions head near (5,4) for future eating. Head direction changes to L.\n- **Turn 42**: Move D (down) to (5,4) and eat the positive food (+1 score, snake grows to 11).  \n  Why: Eats (5,4) while it still has sufficient life span (life span 5 at turn 42). Head direction changes to D.\n- **Turn 43**: Move L (left) to (4,4).  \n  Why: Moves toward (4,2) area. Head direction changes to L.\n- **Turn 44**: Move D (down) to (4,3).  \n  Why: Positions head adjacent to (4,2) for eating next turn. Head direction changes to D.\n\n### Next Steps (Beyond Turn 44):\n- **Turn 45**: Move D (down) to (4,2) to eat the positive food (+1 score, snake grows to 12). This is safe and completes the food collection.\n- **Long-Term**: After turn 45, the snake can explore safely, avoiding walls and internal obstacles. No negative food is present, so focus on survival and seeking new food.\n\nThis sequence ensures both foods are eaten within their life spans with minimal risk, maximizing the score gain by turn 45.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 40: U \\\\\nTurn 41: L \\\\\nTurn 42: D \\\\\nTurn 43: L \\\\\nTurn 44: D\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 is inside, similarly y from 1 to 6. Let me confirm: if x=0 and x=7 are walls, then the grid is from x=1 to x=6, y=1 to y=6? But the snake positions include (6,5), which is x=6, y=5, and walls are x=0/x=7, so x=6 is not a wall; x=7 is wall, so x from 1 to 6 should be fine. Similarly for y.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), so that cell is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: head at (6,5), then (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). So the snake has 10 segments. Head direction is U, which is up, so moving upwards.\n\nFood:\n\n- (5,4) with life_span 7, value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (4,2) with life_span 9, value 1 (positive food)\n\nBoth are positive food, no negative food mentioned.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead. Since the answer format requires actions for multiple turns, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and then in the answer format, it shows actions starting from turn t1, t1+1, etc. But it doesn't specify how many turns to output. Let me read.\n\nIn the answer format, it says:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn \\(t_1\\): action on turn t_1\nTurn \\(t_1 + 1\\): action on turn t_1 + 1\n...\n}\n\nIt has dots, so I need to provide a sequence of actions. But how many? Since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan for at least 5 turns, but output the sequence until a decision point or something. I think I need to output actions for the immediate turns, but based on a plan that looks ahead 5 turns.\n\nBut the output should be the actions for the next few turns, starting from t1=41.\n\nAlso, in the core rules, it says \"prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards\", so I need to avoid risks.\n\nCurrent state: turn 41.\n\nSnake head at (6,5), direction U (up). So if it continues up, it would go to (6,6). But y=7 is wall, so y=6 is inside? Walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 should be playable, since y=7 is wall.\n\nGrid: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells with x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 are inside, I assume. But let's list the coordinates.\n\nFor example, (6,5) is head, and walls x=0/x=7, so x=6 is not wall, y=5 not wall. Moving up to (6,6): y=6, which is less than y=7, so it should be fine. y=7 is wall, so y=6 is the top row, playable.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) has an internal obstacle, so (4,6) is blocked.\n\nNow, possible moves from (6,5): since head direction is U, I can move U, L, or R, but not D because D is opposite? No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction.\n\nCurrent direction U, so opposite is D. So I cannot move down immediately. Possible moves: U (up), L (left), R (right).\n\n- U: to (6,6)\n\n- L: to (5,5)\n\n- R: to (7,5) but x=7 is wall, so invalid. Head at (6,5), R would be x+1=7, y=5, which is wall, so cannot move R.\n\nSimilarly, D is opposite and not allowed anyway.\n\nSo from (6,5), possible moves: U to (6,6) or L to (5,5).\n\nNow, I need to consider the food.\n\nFood at (5,4) and (4,2).\n\n(5,4) has life_span 7, so it disappears after 7 turns, including current turn? Life-span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nCurrent turn t1=41, so for (5,4), life_span=7, so it will disappear after turn 47? Let's see: if countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 41, life_span=7, then turn 42:6, ..., turn 47:1, then after that it disappears, so last chance to eat is turn 47.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) life_span=9, so at turn 41:9, turn 42:8, ..., turn 49:1, disappears after turn 49.\n\nBut I need to eat on the turn when I move to it.\n\nAlso, (4,2) is currently occupied by the snake's body? Snake positions: [(6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)]\n\nSo (4,2) is the 8th segment, index 7 if 0-based: head (0), then (1) (6,4), (2) (6,3), (3) (6,2), (4) (6,1), (5) (5,1), (6) (4,1), (7) (4,2), (8) (4,3), (9) (4,4).\n\nSo (4,2) is a body segment. And food is at (4,2), which is on the body.\n\nBut according to rules, food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nSo for (4,2), since the snake is currently on it, I need to move the body away first, then head can come back to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) is food, but is it occupied? Let's see positions: (5,4) is not in the snake positions. Snake has (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), etc., no (5,4). So (5,4) is free.\n\n(5,4) is at y=4, x=5.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions.\n\nFirst, immediate move: from (6,5), I can go U to (6,6) or L to (5,5).\n\nIf I go U to (6,6), what's there? No food mentioned, and it's empty I think. Then from there, I can move U, but (6,7) is y=7 wall, invalid. Or L to (5,6), or R to (7,6) wall, or D to (6,5) but (6,5) is now body? After moving, the head moves, tail moves, so positions change.\n\nI need to simulate the moves.\n\nAlso, internal obstacle at (4,6), so (4,6) is blocked.\n\nNow, let's think about risks.\n\nFirst, going U to (6,6): from (6,6), possible moves: since direction would be U (if I moved U), so I can go U (invalid), L (to (5,6)), D (to (6,5)), R (invalid).\n\n(6,5) is the previous head position, which is now body after move, so moving to (6,5) would be body collision? After moving to (6,6), the new positions: head at (6,6), body segments: the tail moves forward, so the new body is [(6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)] since tail was (4,4) and it moves to the next position? When snake moves, head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the next one, and tail is removed if no food eaten.\n\nSince no food eaten, tail is removed. So after moving head to (6,6), new positions: head (6,6), then (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). The last segment (4,4) is gone, so (4,3) is the new tail.\n\nNow, from (6,6), if I go D to (6,5), that is the first body segment, so collision, death. So I cannot go down from (6,6) to (6,5).\n\nSimilarly, U and R are walls, so only possible from (6,6) is L to (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is free, I think, no obstacle.\n\nThen from (5,6), etc.\n\nIf I go L from (6,5) to (5,5) now.\n\nFrom (6,5) to (5,5), direction was U, now moving L, so new direction is L.\n\nNew positions: head at (5,5), body: (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). Tail (4,4) gone.\n\n(5,5) is empty, no food.\n\nFrom (5,5), possible moves: since direction L, I can go L to (4,5), U to (5,6), D to (5,4), but not R to (6,5) which is body.\n\nR is opposite? Current direction L, opposite is R, so cannot move R.\n\nSo from (5,5), can go L to (4,5), U to (5,6), D to (5,4).\n\n(5,4) has food! Positive food at (5,4).\n\nSo if I go D from (5,5) to (5,4), I eat the food, snake grows.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, there is food at (4,2) on body, which I might want to eat later.\n\nFirst, let's consider options for turn 41.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (6,6)\n\nThen from there, only possible move is L to (5,6), since U and R wall, D to body.\n\nAt (5,6), no food, and from there, I can go L to (4,6) but (4,6) is internal obstacle, blocked. Or D to (5,5), or U to (5,7) wall, or R to (6,6) which is body now.\n\nAfter moving to (5,6), positions: head at (5,6), body (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), etc. down to (4,3).\n\nFrom (5,6), direction after moving L? From (6,6) to (5,6) is left, so direction L.\n\nThen possible moves: L to (4,6) but obstacle, invalid. U to (5,7) wall. D to (5,5). R to (6,6) which is body segment, collision, invalid.\n\nSo only D to (5,5).\n\n(5,5) is empty? In this path, when I go from (6,5) to (6,6) to (5,6) to (5,5), (5,5) might be occupied or not.\n\nLet's trace positions.\n\nTurn 41: start at (6,5), move U to (6,6). New positions: (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\nTurn 42: from (6,6) move L to (5,6). New head (5,6), body (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2)  // tail (4,3) gone? After move, no food, so tail moves off, so positions: head (5,6), then (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2)  // since (4,3) was tail, removed, (4,2) is now tail? Let's index: old positions before move: head (6,6), body (6,5), (6,4), ..., (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) but (4,3) is last? Earlier: after turn 41, positions: (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)  // 10 segments.\n\nAfter moving head to (5,6), new head (5,6), then the body segments follow: first body segment to previous head (6,6), then (6,5), (6,4), ..., down to (4,2), and the tail (4,3) is removed, so new positions: (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2)  // now (4,2) is tail.\n\nFrom (5,6), move D to (5,5). (5,5) is empty, no food.\n\nNew positions: head (5,5), body (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)  // tail (4,2) gone.\n\nThen from (5,5), I can go to (5,4) which has food.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nThis path seems safe but I end up at (5,5) on turn 43 or something, and (5,4) is there.\n\nBut in this case, I didn't eat (5,4) yet.\n\nNow, option for turn 41: move L to (5,5)\n\nFrom (6,5) move L to (5,5), new head (5,5), body (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)  // tail (4,4) gone.\n\nNow at (5,5), I can go D to (5,4) which has food, or U to (5,6), or L to (4,5).\n\nIf I go D to (5,4), I eat the food, so snake grows: new length 11, head at (5,4), and tail doesn't move, so positions: head (5,4), then (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), and since ate food, add new segment, so tail is (4,3), but new segment added at tail, so positions: head (5,4), then (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) and the new segment is added where the tail was, but since tail was moving, it stays, so the body is head new position, then previous head, etc., and tail is extended.\n\nAfter eating, the tail doesn't move, so the new segment is added at the previous tail position.\n\nBefore move, positions: head (6,5), body segments.\n\nAfter moving to (5,5), no food eaten, so positions: head (5,5), then (6,5), (6,4), ..., down to (4,3), and (4,4) gone.\n\nBut if I move to (5,4) from (5,5), and (5,4) has food, so when I move to (5,4), I eat it, so head to (5,4), body: the first segment is previous head (5,5), then (6,5), (6,4), ..., down to (4,3), and since ate food, a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, which is (4,3), so new positions: head (5,4), body (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), and (4,3) since added, so (4,2) and (4,3) both present? Let's list:\n\nAfter eating at (5,4):\n\n- New head: (5,4)\n\n- Then previous head: (5,5)\n\n- Then the rest: (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)  // this is 9 segments, but should be 10 segments before eating? Before the move to (5,4), positions were 10 segments: head (5,5), body (6,5) to (4,3).\n\nAfter moving head to (5,4) and eating, the body moves: the segment that was at (5,5) is now at (5,4)? No.\n\nStandard snake: when head moves to new cell, if no food, each body segment moves to the next position, tail removed.\n\nIf food eaten, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to next, but tail does not move, so a new segment is added at the tail position, so length increases.\n\nSo before eating at (5,4): positions at turn 41 after moving to (5,5) if that was the move, but let's start from turn 41.\n\nTurn 41: from (6,5) move L to (5,5). No food at (5,5), so new positions: head (5,5), body (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)  // 10 segments, tail (4,3).\n\nThen turn 42: from (5,5) move D to (5,4). (5,4) has food, so eat it. New head (5,4), body: first segment is previous head (5,5), then (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) and since ate, add new segment at previous tail position (4,3), so new tail at (4,3), and the segment before that is (4,2), so positions: head (5,4), then (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)  // 11 segments.\n\n(4,2) is still there, and it has food on it? Food is at (4,2), and it's a body segment.\n\nBut the food is still there, under the body, but it can only be eaten when the body moves away and head moves in.\n\nNow, back to planning.\n\nIf I go directly to (5,4) by moving L then D, I eat the food at (5,4) on turn 42.\n\nBut is that good? Value +1, length increases.\n\nBut there is risk or something?\n\nFrom (5,4), I need to move somewhere.\n\nPossible moves from (5,4): direction was D (since moved down from (5,5)), so current direction D.\n\nCan move D, L, R, not U (opposite).\n\nD to (5,3): y=3, which is within bounds.\n\nL to (4,4)\n\nR to (6,4) but (6,4) is body segment, collision.\n\nPositions: head at (5,4), body (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), etc. (6,4) is the third segment, so if I go R to (6,4), that's body, collision, death.\n\nU is invalid because opposite.\n\nSo from (5,4), can go D to (5,3) or L to (4,4).\n\n(4,4) is empty? Snake has (4,4) in positions? After eating, positions include (4,2), (4,3), but (4,4) is not there; in the list, after eating, segments are up to (4,3), so (4,4) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) free.\n\nAlso, (4,2) has food on body, but I need to move away to eat it later.\n\nNow, if I go L to (4,4) from (5,4), that might be ok.\n\nBut let's think about the other food at (4,2).\n\n(4,2) is currently a body segment with food under it. To eat it, I need the body to move away from (4,2), then head to move to it.\n\nCurrently, (4,2) is occupied, so when the snake moves, if the segment at (4,2) moves, then the cell is free, but the food is still there, and I can move head to it later.\n\nBut the food has life_span, so I need to eat it before it disappears.\n\nAlso, there's a danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because of collision.\n\nBut tail is at (4,3) after eating at (5,4), so (4,3) is tail.\n\n(4,2) is not tail, it's the 9th segment or something.\n\nPositions: head (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) tail.\n\nSo (4,2) is the 10th segment, not tail, tail is (4,3).\n\nSo no immediate tail danger.\n\nBut to eat (4,2), I need to have the head move to (4,2) when it's empty.\n\nCurrently occupied, so after some moves, when the snake moves, the segment at (4,2) will move to the next position, freeing (4,2), then I can move head to it.\n\nBut the food is on (4,2), so when the cell is free, food is still there, I can eat it.\n\nLife_span 9, so plenty of time.\n\nNow, back to turn 41 decision.\n\nIf I move U to (6,6), then I go to (5,6), then to (5,5), and from (5,5) I can go to (5,4) to eat on turn 43 or later.\n\nBut in that case, I eat later, but the food might not be there if I delay, but life_span 7, from turn 41, so I have until turn 47 to eat.\n\nIf I move L on turn 41, I can eat on turn 42.\n\nBut is there a reason not to eat immediately?\n\nThe grid is small, and I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (4,6) blocks that area.\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nGrid x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nWalls: x=0,7; y=0,7; internal (4,6) blocked.\n\nSnake positions: head (6,5), body down to (6,1), then left to (5,1), then up to (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4).\n\nSo the snake is like: from (6,5) down to (6,1), then left to (5,1), then up to (4,4).\n\nFood at (5,4) and (4,2) on body.\n\n(4,2) is part of the body.\n\nNow, if I eat (5,4) soon, the snake grows, and I have to navigate.\n\nBut there might be a risk of trapping myself.\n\nFor example, if I eat (5,4), head at (5,4), then I can go to (4,4) or (5,3).\n\n(4,4) is currently the tail? Before eating, tail is (4,4), but after moving to (5,5), tail is (4,3), then after eating at (5,4), tail is (4,3) with new segment.\n\nIn the eat scenario: after turn 42, head at (5,4), body to (4,3) tail.\n\nFrom (5,4), go L to (4,4). (4,4) is free, no food mentioned.\n\nNew positions: head (4,4), body (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), etc. down to (4,3)? After moving to (4,4), no food, so tail moves.\n\nPrevious positions: head (5,4), body (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\nMove head to (4,4), no food there, so new head (4,4), body: (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2)  // tail (4,3) gone.\n\n(4,2) has food, but it's now a body segment.\n\nFrom (4,4), I can go U to (4,5), D to (4,3), L to (3,4), R to (5,4) but (5,4) is body now.\n\nDirection: after moving to (4,4) from (5,4), which was left, so direction L.\n\nCan move L to (3,4), U to (4,5), D to (4,3), not R (opposite).\n\n(4,3) is free? In positions, after move, (4,3) is not occupied, tail was (4,3) but removed, so (4,3) free.\n\nBut (4,2) is body with food.\n\nIf I go D to (4,3), no food, then from there, etc.\n\nBut I want to eat the food at (4,2) eventually.\n\nSince (4,2) has food on body, I need to move the snake so that the segment at (4,2) moves away, freeing the cell, then head can move to it.\n\nFor example, after a few moves, when the body at (4,2) moves to the next position, (4,2) is free, then I can go to it.\n\nBut the head needs to be able to access it.\n\nCurrently, the head is at (5,4) after eating (5,4), or at other positions.\n\nPerhaps I should plan a path to eat both foods.\n\nBut (4,2) life_span 9, so I have time.\n\nFirst, let's consider not eating (5,4) immediately.\n\nIf on turn 41 I move U to (6,6).\n\nThen turn 42 move L to (5,6).\n\nThen turn 43 move D to (5,5).\n\nNow at (5,5), I can move D to (5,4) to eat on turn 44.\n\nSimilar to before but one turn later.\n\nThen from (5,4), as before.\n\nOr from (5,5), I could go L to (4,5) or U to (5,6) but (5,6) is body now.\n\nAfter moving to (5,5) on turn 43, positions: let's simulate.\n\nTurn 41: move U to (6,6), positions: (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\nTurn 42: move L to (5,6), positions: head (5,6), body (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2)  // tail (4,3) gone\n\nTurn 43: move D to (5,5), positions: head (5,5), body (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)  // tail (4,2) gone? Tail was (4,2), removed, so (4,1) is tail.\n\n(4,2) is free now? When tail (4,2) moves off, (4,2) is free, and food is there, so I can move to (4,2) to eat.\n\nAt turn 43, after moving to (5,5), (4,2) is free and has food.\n\nBut head is at (5,5), not adjacent to (4,2).\n\n(5,5) to (4,2) is not adjacent; adjacent cells are (4,5), (5,4), (6,5), (5,6).\n\n(4,2) is at x=4,y=2, (5,5) is x=5,y=5, not adjacent.\n\nSo I need to move towards it.\n\nFrom (5,5), I can go L to (4,5) or D to (5,4) or U to (5,6) but (5,6) is body, or R to (6,5) body.\n\nSo L to (4,5) or D to (5,4).\n\n(5,4) has food, so if I go D to (5,4), I eat it on turn 44.\n\nThen I grow, and (4,2) food is still there.\n\nBut after eating (5,4), head at (5,4), then I can go to (4,4) or (5,3), etc., to reach (4,2).\n\n(4,2) is at (4,2), which is now free, as we saw.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can go L to (4,4), then from (4,4) to (4,3) or (4,5), then to (4,2) or something.\n\n(4,2) is at y=2, so I need to go down.\n\nBut let's think about the tail danger.\n\nIf I eat (5,4) and grow, the tail is at (4,1) or something.\n\nIn the positions after eating (5,4) on turn 44, head at (5,4), body (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1) and new tail added at (4,1) since ate, so tail at (4,1).\n\nPositions: head (5,4), then (5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)  // 11 segments.\n\n(4,2) is free with food.\n\nHead at (5,4), I can go L to (4,4), then from (4,4) to (4,3), then to (4,2) to eat.\n\nFrom (4,4) to (4,3) is down, then to (4,2) down.\n\nBut when I go to (4,2), if the tail is adjacent, there might be danger.\n\nTail is at (4,1), which is adjacent to (4,2)? (4,1) and (4,2) are adjacent vertically.\n\nIf head is at (4,3) and I move to (4,2), and tail is at (4,1), then after moving, head at (4,2), tail at (4,1), so they are adjacent, but not colliding because tail is not the new position.\n\nRule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\nHere, when I move to (4,2), the tail is at (4,1), which has no food, I think. Food is at (4,2), not on tail.\n\nThe danger is if the tail cell has food, and head is adjacent, then eating that food causes collision.\n\nBut in this case, when I move to (4,2), the tail is at (4,1), no food, and I eat the food at (4,2), which is not on tail, so it should be fine.\n\nAfter eating, new tail added.\n\nNo problem.\n\nBut to reach (4,2), from head at (5,4), I need to go left to (4,4), then down to (4,3), then down to (4,2).\n\nAt (4,3), if I move to (4,2), it should be ok.\n\nBut (4,3) might be occupied? In the positions, after being at (5,4), (4,3) is not occupied, it's free.\n\nIn the current state, (4,3) is body, but after moving, it changes.\n\nLet's plan a sequence.\n\nFirst, for turn 41, I think moving L to (5,5) is better because I can eat (5,4) sooner.\n\nThen on turn 42, move D to (5,4) to eat.\n\nThen on turn 43, from (5,4), I need to move, say L to (4,4).\n\nThen turn 44, from (4,4) move D to (4,3).\n\nThen turn 45, from (4,3) move D to (4,2) to eat the other food.\n\nBut when I move to (4,2) on turn 45, I eat it, grow again.\n\nBut is (4,2) free at that time?\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nTurn 41: move L to (5,5), no eat. Positions: head (5,5), body (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)  // tail (4,3)\n\nTurn 42: move D to (5,4), eat food at (5,4). New positions: head (5,4), body (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)  // new segment at (4,3), so tail at (4,3)\n\n(4,2) is still body segment with food under it.\n\nTurn 43: move from (5,4) to (4,4). Assume no food at (4,4), so move, no eat. New positions: head (4,4), body (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2)  // tail (4,3) gone? After moving head to (4,4), no food, so body moves: previous head (5,4) to (4,4)? New head (4,4), then first body segment to previous head (5,4), then (5,5), (6,5), etc., down to (4,2), and tail (4,3) removed, so new positions: head (4,4), body (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2)  // 11 segments, tail (4,2)\n\n(4,2) is now the tail, and it has food on it.\n\nBut the food is under the tail now.\n\nTo eat it, I need to move the tail away, but tail moves when snake moves without eating.\n\nIf I move from (4,4), I can go to (4,3) or (4,5) or (3,4), etc.\n\nSay turn 44: from (4,4) move D to (4,3). (4,3) is free, no food. So move, no eat. New positions: head (4,3), body (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)  // tail (4,2) gone.\n\nNow, (4,2) is free, and food is there.\n\nHead at (4,3), which is adjacent to (4,2).\n\nI can move directly to (4,2) to eat.\n\nBut now, when I move to (4,2), the tail is at (4,1), which is adjacent to (4,2).\n\nAnd (4,2) has positive food, so if I eat it, there might be danger.\n\nRule: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake\"\n\nHere, before moving, head is at (4,3), tail is at (4,1), not adjacent; (4,3) and (4,1) are not adjacent, since |dy|=2.\n\nAfter I move to (4,2), head at (4,2), tail at (4,1), which are adjacent.\n\nAnd I am eating the food at (4,2), which is the cell I'm moving to.\n\nThe rule says \"the tail cell has positive food\", meaning if the tail is on a food cell, and head is adjacent, eating that food causes collision because when you eat, the tail doesn't move, so head and tail collide.\n\nIn this case, when I move to (4,2), the tail is at (4,1), not on the food. The food is at (4,2), which I am moving to, so I eat it, and since tail is at (4,1), after eating, head at (4,2), body includes (4,3), (4,4), etc., and tail at (4,1) stays, new segment added, so tail remains at (4,1), head at (4,2), adjacent but not colliding because different cells.\n\nCollision is when head touches body, but tail is body, so if head and tail are on adjacent cells, it's not collision; collision is when head and body are on the same cell.\n\nThe rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment)\" so if head and a body segment are on the same cell.\n\nWhen head moves to a cell with body, it collides.\n\nBut in this case, when I move to (4,2), if (4,2) is free, no body, so no collision.\n\nThe tail danger is specific: if the tail is on a food cell, and head is adjacent, then if you eat that food, since tail doesn't move, head moves to tail position or something? Let's read carefully.\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nAh, I see: when you eat the food on the tail cell, the tail doesn't move, so the new segment is added at the current tail position, but since head is adjacent and moves to the tail cell, head moves to the same cell as tail, causing collision.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nIn this case, for (4,2), at turn 44, after moving to (4,3), positions have tail at (4,1), not at (4,2).\n\n(4,2) is free with food.\n\nHead at (4,3), tail at (4,1), not adjacent.\n\nMove to (4,2): head moves to (4,2), which has food, so eat it. At this moment, tail is at (4,1), not on (4,2), so no issue.\n\nAfter eating, new head (4,2), body segments: previous head (4,3) moves to (4,2)? No: when head moves to (4,2), the first body segment goes to previous head position (4,3), and so on, and since ate food, a new segment is added at the previous tail position, which is (4,1), so tail stays at (4,1), and new segment at (4,1).\n\nSo positions: head (4,2), body (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)  // 12 segments, with (4,1) being the tail.\n\nNo collision.\n\nThe tail danger only applies if the food is on the tail cell itself.\n\nIn this case, when (4,2) was tail earlier, but when I move to eat it, it's not tail anymore.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 43, tail was at (4,2), but I didn't eat it then; I moved away, so at turn 44, tail is at (4,1), and (4,2) is free.\n\nSo eating at (4,2) is safe.\n\nNow, back to turn 41.\n\nIf I move U to (6,6), I might have less space to maneuver.\n\nFor example, from (6,6) to (5,6) to (5,5), then to (5,4) to eat on turn 44, later than if I move L on turn 41.\n\nSimilarly, I can then go to (4,4) etc. to eat (4,2).\n\nBut since I eat (5,4) later, and (4,2) has longer life, it might be fine, but I get the point later.\n\nBut moving L on turn 41 allows me to eat (5,4) on turn 42, getting the reward sooner.\n\nAlso, by eating, I grow, which might be good for score, but I need to survive.\n\nThe grid has limited space.\n\nAfter eating both, I have a longer snake, need to find space.\n\nBut there are no other foods, so I need to survive.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid eating immediately to have more space.\n\nBut the food will disappear, so I should eat them.\n\nSince both are positive, eating is good.\n\nNow, another thing: the internal obstacle at (4,6), so the top row is partially blocked.\n\nIf I go to (6,6), it might be a dead end if not careful.\n\nFor example, from (6,6), only way out is to (5,6), then to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut I can go down.\n\nWhereas from (5,5), I have more options.\n\nSo moving L to (5,5) on turn 41 seems better.\n\nThen on turn 42, move D to (5,4) to eat.\n\nThen on turn 43, move L to (4,4).\n\nThen on turn 44, move D to (4,3).\n\nThen on turn 45, move D to (4,2) to eat.\n\nBut at turn 44, after moving to (4,3), (4,2) is free, so on turn 45 move to (4,2) to eat.\n\nThen I have eaten both foods.\n\nNow, after that, I need to survive.\n\nBut the answer format requires actions for multiple turns, but not specified how many.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should provide a sequence for 5 turns or so.\n\nStart from turn 41.\n\nSo for turn 41: move L to (5,5)\n\nThen turn 42: move D to (5,4) to eat\n\nThen turn 43: from (5,4) move L to (4,4)  (since U and R invalid or risky, D to (5,3) or L to (4,4))\n\nL to (4,4) is fine.\n\nThen turn 44: from (4,4) move D to (4,3)\n\nThen turn 45: from (4,3) move D to (4,2) to eat the other food.\n\nNow, after turn 45, head at (4,2), grown, etc.\n\nBut I need to think if this is safe.\n\nAfter eating (4,2), positions: head (4,2), body (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1) and new segment at (4,1), so tail at (4,1).\n\nNow, from (4,2), I can move to (4,1) but that is tail, collision. Or to (3,2), or (4,3) but (4,3) is body, or (5,2).\n\nPossible moves: direction after moving down to (4,2), so direction D.\n\nCan move D to (4,1), but (4,1) is tail, body segment, collision.\n\nL to (3,2)\n\nU to (4,3) but (4,3) is body segment, collision.\n\nR to (5,2)\n\nSo only L to (3,2) or R to (5,2).\n\n(3,2) or (5,2) should be free.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut at turn 45, I have provided actions up to there.\n\nPerhaps I should output actions for turns 41 to 45 or 46.\n\nBut the sequence seems reasonable.\n\nIf on turn 41 I move U, I go to (6,6), then to (5,6), then to (5,5), then on turn 44 to (5,4) to eat, then to (4,4) on turn 45, etc., but I eat later.\n\nMoreover, in that case, when I go to (5,5) on turn 43, (4,2) might be free if tail moved, but in the U path, on turn 43, after moving to (5,5), tail is at (4,1), and (4,2) is free with food, so I could go directly to (4,2) from (5,5)? Not adjacent.\n\n(5,5) to (4,2) not adjacent.\n\nI need to go via (4,5) or something.\n\nBut it might take more turns.\n\nSo the first plan is more direct.\n\nAlso, to maximize score, eating sooner is better, since I get the point earlier, but score is based on eating, and length increases, but the value is +1 per food.\n\nNow, about the life-span: (5,4) life_span 7, if I eat on turn 42, it's fine; if I delay, it might disappear, but with life_span 7, on turn 41, it has 7 turns, so eat by turn 47.\n\nSimilarly for (4,2), life_span 9, eat by turn 49.\n\nSo no rush.\n\nBut in the sequence, I can eat both by turn 45.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions.\n\nAlso, in the sequence, on turn 43, from (5,4), I move L to (4,4), but I could move D to (5,3) instead.\n\nIf I move D to (5,3), then I go down, and (4,2) is not directly accessible; I would need to go left later.\n\nFor example, from (5,3), I can go to (4,3) or (5,2), etc., but to reach (4,2), it might take more turns.\n\nWhereas going to (4,4) then down is direct.\n\nSo it's fine.\n\nSimilarly, after eating (4,2), I can move to (3,2) or (5,2) to explore.\n\nBut since no more food, I need to survive, but for the plan, I think up to eating both is good.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if moving U on turn 41 is safer.\n\nFor example, if I move U to (6,6), then to (5,6), then to (5,5), then on turn 44 move to (5,4) to eat, then from (5,4) I can move to (4,4) or (5,3).\n\nIf I move to (4,4), then to (4,3), then to (4,2) on turn 47 or so.\n\nBut (4,2) life_span 9, so on turn 47, it would be: at turn 41, life_span 9, turn 42:8, ..., turn 49:1, so turn 47 is fine, life_span 3 or something.\n\nBut it takes more turns to eat.\n\nIn terms of score, eating sooner means I can potentially eat more later, but there are no other foods, so eating both early is fine.\n\nAlso, the grid might have new food spawn, but the state doesn't mention, so I think only these foods.\n\nIn the input, only two foods given, so probably only these for now.\n\nSo I think moving L on turn 41 is better.\n\nThen the sequence: turn 41: L\n\nTurn 42: D\n\nTurn 43: L (to (4,4))\n\nFrom (5,4) to (4,4) is left, so L.\n\nThen turn 44: D (to (4,3))\n\nThen turn 45: D (to (4,2) to eat)\n\nI could stop at turn 45 or add more.\n\nSince I need to think ahead, but output actions.\n\nPerhaps output for 5 turns: 41 to 45.\n\nBut turn 41 to 45 is 5 actions.\n\nTurn 41,42,43,44,45.\n\nYes.\n\nIn turn 43, when I move from (5,4) to (4,4), is that valid? Current direction after moving to (5,4) is D (since I moved down from (5,5)).\n\nFrom (5,4), direction D, moving left to (4,4) is perpendicular, so allowed, not opposite.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nNow, to confirm the directions.\n\nTurn 41: from (6,5) move L to (5,5), action L\n\nTurn 42: from (5,5) move D to (5,4), action D\n\nTurn 43: from (5,4) move L to (4,4), action L\n\nTurn 44: from (4,4) move D to (4,3), action D\n\nTurn 45: from (4,3) move D to (4,2), action D\n\nAfter that, from (4,2), as above, I can move L or R.\n\nBut I think for the output, this should be fine.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid the tail danger, but in this case, no issue.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 44, when I move to (4,3), and (4,2) is free, but head is at (4,3), tail at (4,1), not adjacent, so moving to (4,2) is safe.\n\nIf I had moved differently, but here it's ok.\n\nSo I think this sequence is good.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating both positive food items while prioritizing long-term survival, I have planned a sequence of moves for the next 5 turns (turns 41 to 45). This plan involves:\n- Eating the food at (5,4) on turn 42 to gain +1 score and increase snake length.\n- Freeing and then eating the food at (4,2) on turn 45 to gain another +1 score and further increase snake length.\n- Avoiding all collisions and dead ends by carefully navigating around the snake's body and the internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\n### Key Considerations for the Plan:\n- **Immediate Move (Turn 41)**: From the head position (6,5) with current direction U, moving left (L) to (5,5) is chosen instead of up (U) to avoid the top row dead end near (6,6), which has limited escape routes. Moving L allows access to (5,4) for early food consumption.\n- **Food at (5,4)**: Has a life span of 7, meaning it disappears after turn 47. Eating it on turn 42 is safe and efficient.\n- **Food at (4,2)**: Currently under the snake's body (specifically, the segment at (4,2)). It has a life span of 9 (disappears after turn 49), so there is time to free it by moving the body away. The plan moves the snake to free (4,2) by turn 44 and eats it on turn 45.\n- **Collision Avoidance**: \n  - The path avoids walls (x=0/x=7, y=0/y=7) and the internal obstacle (4,6).\n  - No instant reverse moves are made (e.g., no D after U).\n  - Tail reward danger is avoided: when eating (4,2) on turn 45, the tail is at (4,1), which is adjacent but not on the food cell, so no collision occurs.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: After turn 45, the snake has grown to 12 segments and is positioned at (4,2) with open moves to (3,2) or (5,2), allowing safe continuation. The plan focuses on eating available food quickly to score points while keeping the snake in open areas to avoid trapping.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence below is based on simulating moves 5 turns ahead, ensuring safety and optimal food consumption:\n\n- **Turn 41**: Move L (left) to (5,5).  \n  *Reason: Avoids the risky top row, positions for (5,4) food access. New head position: (5,5). Direction: L.*\n\n- **Turn 42**: Move D (down) to (5,4) to eat positive food.  \n  *Reason: Eats food for +1 score and growth. New head position: (5,4). Direction: D. Snake length now 11.*\n\n- **Turn 43**: Move L (left) to (4,4).  \n  *Reason: Moves toward (4,2) while avoiding body collisions. New head position: (4,4). Direction: L.*\n\n- **Turn 44**: Move D (down) to (4,3).  \n  *Reason: Frees (4,2) for eating and avoids obstacles. New head position: (4,3). Direction: D. (4,2) is now free with food.*\n\n- **Turn 45**: Move D (down) to (4,2) to eat positive food.  \n  *Reason: Eats food for +1 score and growth. New head position: (4,2). Direction: D. Snake length now 12. Tail is at (4,1), adjacent but not on food, so safe.*\n\n### Verification of 5+ Turn Lookahead:\n- **Turn 41 (Start)**: Snake positions: [(6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4)]. Moving L to (5,5) is valid (not opposite to U, no wall/body).\n- **Turn 42**: Positions after move: head (5,5), body (6,5), (6,4), ..., (4,3). Moving D to (5,4) eats food; new positions: head (5,4), body (5,5), (6,5), ..., (4,3) with new tail segment at (4,3).\n- **Turn 43**: Positions: head (5,4), body (5,5), (6,5), ..., (4,2). Moving L to (4,4) is valid (perpendicular to D, no collision).\n- **Turn 44**: Positions: head (4,4), body (5,4), (5,5), ..., (4,2). Tail (4,3) removed, freeing (4,3). Moving D to (4,3) is safe. (4,2) now free with food.\n- **Turn 45**: Positions: head (4,3), body (4,4), (5,4), ..., (4,1). Moving D to (4,2) eats food; no tail danger (tail at (4,1), food at (4,2)).\n- **Beyond Turn 45**: From (4,2), moves to (3,2) or (5,2) are safe for continued survival, with no immediate threats.\n\nThis plan scores 2 points by turn 45 and ensures the snake remains in a controllable position. If new food spawns, it can be incorporated into future moves.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 41: L\nTurn 42: D\nTurn 43: L\nTurn 44: D\nTurn 45: D\n}",

        "step": 42,
        "score": 9,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 42. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (4,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block movement.\n\nSnake positions: head at (5,5), then body segments: (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). So the snake is 10 segments long. Head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to get to (5,5) from previous position.\n\nFood: there are two food items:\n\n- One at (5,4) with value 1 and life span 6. So it will disappear in 6 turns, including this turn, so it has 5 more turns after this if not eaten.\n\n- Another at (4,2) with value 1 and life span 8. Similarly, it has 7 more turns after this.\n\nBoth are positive food since value is +1.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score and avoid risks.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid. I'll assume coordinates: x from 0 to 7 left to right, y from 0 to 7 bottom to top? The state says walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 top? Typically in grids, y increases upwards, but I should confirm.\n\nSnake positions: head (5,5), then (6,5), which is right of head, but head direction is L, left. So from (6,5) it moved left to (5,5), yes.\n\nBody: (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), then (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). So the snake is like: head at (5,5), then it goes down to (6,5)? No: positions are listed head first: (5,5) head, then (6,5) which is segment 2, then (6,4), (6,3), etc. So from head to tail: (5,5) -> (6,5) -> (6,4) -> (6,3) -> (6,2) -> (6,1) -> (5,1) -> (4,1) -> (4,2) -> (4,3).\n\n(4,2) and (4,3) are both part of the body? (4,2) is the second last, tail is at (4,3)? Positions: index 0: head (5,5), 1: (6,5), 2: (6,4), 3: (6,3), 4: (6,2), 5: (6,1), 6: (5,1), 7: (4,1), 8: (4,2), 9: (4,3) tail.\n\nTail is at (4,3). And food is at (4,2) which is occupied by the snake! (4,2) is the 8th segment, which is part of the body. But food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves there later.\n\nSpecifically, food at (4,2) with value 1 and life span 8. But (4,2) is currently occupied by the snake body segment at index 8.\n\nSimilarly, food at (5,4) with value 1, life span 6. Where is (5,4)? Let's see the snake: positions include (6,4), which is (x=6,y=4), but (5,4) is not listed, so it might be empty or have food.\n\nSnake positions: (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). So (5,4) is not occupied, so food can be there.\n\n(4,2) is occupied by snake body, but food is listed there, so it must be under the body.\n\nNow, head is at (5,5), direction left.\n\nPossible moves: since head direction is L, I cannot move right (opposite) next turn. So possible moves: U, D, L. But L is left, which is decreasing x.\n\nCurrent head position: (5,5)\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n- Up: (5,6) - y+1\n\n- Down: (5,4) - y-1\n\n- Left: (4,5) - x-1\n\n- Right: (6,5) - but right is (6,5), which is occupied by the body segment 1. Also, moving right would be opposite to current direction L, so not allowed anyway.\n\nCannot move opposite, so only U, D, L possible.\n\nNow, check each direction for safety and opportunities.\n\nFirst, Up: (5,6)\n\nIs this within bounds? Walls: y=7 is wall, y=6 is below 7, so (5,6) should be free? Walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also internal obstacle (4,6).\n\n(5,6): x=5, y=6. Not border, not (4,6), so it should be free. But is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: all positions are below y=5 except head, head is (5,5), so (5,6) should be empty. Food? No food listed at (5,6), only at (5,4) and (4,2).\n\nFood is at (5,4) and (4,2), so (5,6) is empty and safe to move? But need to check if moving there causes collision later or something.\n\nFor immediate move, check if cell is free and not wall.\n\n(5,6): not wall, not occupied (since snake is all at y<=5 except potential, but positions: (5,5) head, others are y=5,4,3,2,1, so y=6 is free. So up to (5,6) is possible.\n\nDown: (5,4)\n\nThis has food! Food at (5,4) with value +1, life span 6. If I move down to (5,4), I eat the food, snake grows to length 11, so new tail position will be added after current tail.\n\nBut is it safe? (5,4) is not occupied by body? Snake positions: (6,4) is occupied, but (5,4) is not listed, so it should be free except for the food. Since food is there, but when head moves there, it eats food.\n\nBut check for collisions: moving to (5,4), which is adjacent to head, and not body, so no immediate collision. But after eating, the tail doesn't move this turn, so snake grows.\n\nAlso, need to consider future risks.\n\nLeft: (4,5)\n\nIs (4,5) free? Walls: internal obstacle at (4,6), but (4,5) is different. Borders: x=0,7; y=0,7. (4,5) is within bounds. Snake positions: head (5,5), body (6,5), (6,4), etc., no (4,5), so it should be free. Food? No food at (4,5), so moving left to (4,5) is possible.\n\nNow, also, there's food at (4,2), but it's under the body at segment 8, index 8: (4,2). So it can only be eaten if the snake moves away and head comes later.\n\nNow, life spans: food at (5,4) life span 6, meaning it disappears after 6 turns including this turn 42, so if not eaten by turn 47, it's gone. Similarly, (4,2) life span 8, disappears after turn 49.\n\nBut (4,2) is under body, so we need to free that cell first.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n\nFirst, let's list possible actions for turn 42.\n\nChoices: U, D, or L.\n\nIf I move D to (5,4), I eat the food immediately, get +1, snake grows. But is there risk?\n\nAfter moving to (5,4), head is at (5,4), and body follows: the new position will be head at (5,4), then the previous head (5,5) becomes segment 1, then (6,5), (6,4), etc. Since I ate food, tail stays, so tail is still at (4,3), and new segment added, so positions: head (5,4), then (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) tail. (4,2) is still part of body, and food is there, but since it's under body, not eaten yet.\n\nNow, head direction: after moving down, direction becomes D.\n\nThen for next turn, possible moves.\n\nBut let's see the grid state after moving D on turn 42.\n\nTurn 42: move D to (5,4), eat food, score +1, snake length 11.\n\nThen turn 43: head at (5,4), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: since direction D, cannot move U (opposite). So possible: L, R, D? Directions: U, D, L, R.\n\nFrom (5,4):\n\n- U: (5,5) - but (5,5) is now the first body segment, so occupied, cannot move there.\n\n- D: (5,3) - y-1, is this free? Walls: y=0 is bottom, so (5,3) should be free. Snake positions: after eating, body has (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), etc. (6,3) is there, but (5,3) not occupied, so free. Food? No food listed, so possible.\n\n- L: (4,4) - x-1, not wall, not occupied? Snake: no (4,4), so free.\n\n- R: (6,4) - x+1, but (6,4) is occupied by body segment, index 3 or something, yes, occupied, cannot move there.\n\nAlso, direction is D, so moving U is opposite, not allowed, which we have.\n\nSo possible moves from (5,4): L to (4,4) or D to (5,3).\n\nIf I move L to (4,4), or D to (5,3).\n\nNow, if I had moved U or L on turn 42, different path.\n\nBut let's consider not eating the food immediately to avoid potential risks.\n\nThere might be a danger with the tail.\n\nLook at the tail: tail is at (4,3), and food is at (4,2), which is adjacent to tail? (4,2) and (4,3) are both part of snake, but (4,2) is segment 8, (4,3) tail.\n\nIf the head were to move to (4,2) when it's free, it might be dangerous if tail is adjacent.\n\nRule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn this case, the food is at (4,2), but currently, (4,2) is occupied by body, not tail. Tail is at (4,3).\n\nSo if we free (4,2) by moving, and later head moves there, we need to see where the tail is.\n\nBut for now, on turn 42, if I move to (5,4), I eat that food, no immediate danger.\n\nBut let's think long term.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid eating the (5,4) food if it leads to a trap.\n\nAnother idea: the snake is currently wrapping around, and there might be space issues.\n\nLet me map the grid mentally.\n\nGrid 8x8: x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders and (4,6) internal.\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- Head: (5,5)\n\n- Body: (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) tail.\n\nSo the snake occupies: right column from y=5 to y=1, then at y=1, from x=6 to x=4, then up to (4,2) and (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is tail.\n\nEmpty spaces: for example, left side, x=0 to 3, y=2 to 7 except walls.\n\nAlso, food at (5,4) which is currently free, and (4,2) under body.\n\nLife span: (5,4) has 6 turns, so it will disappear on turn 48? Life span N, disappears after N turns including current, so on turn 42, life span 6, means it appears for 6 turns: turns 42,43,44,45,46,47, gone on 48. Similarly, (4,2) life span 8: turns 42 to 49, gone on 50.\n\nBut (4,2) is under body, so it needs to be freed first.\n\nTo free (4,2), the snake needs to move so that the segment at (4,2) moves away.\n\nCurrently, the body segment at (4,2) will move when the snake moves, depending on the path.\n\nThe segment at (4,2) is part of the body, so when the snake moves, it will shift.\n\nFor example, on turn 42, if I move the head, the tail will move if no food eaten, or stay if eaten.\n\nFirst, let's consider not eating on turn 42, so tail moves.\n\nCase 1: move U to (5,6) on turn 42.\n\nThen head to (5,6), direction U.\n\nBody: previous head (5,5) becomes segment 1, then (6,5), (6,4), ..., up to (4,3) becomes the new tail? Since no food eaten, tail moves: the last segment (4,3) is removed, and the new positions: head (5,6), then (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2) tail. (4,2) is now the tail, and food is there! But since it's under tail, and we didn't eat, the food is still there under tail.\n\nWhen the tail moves, the cell is freed, but food is there, so the food becomes accessible if head moves there later.\n\nAfter move U: tail was at (4,3), moved to (4,2)? Positions: after moving head to (5,6), the body segments shift: segment 1 (was head) to (5,5), segment 2 (was (6,5)) to (6,5)? No.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So:\n\n- Head moves to (5,6)\n\n- Segment 1 (was at (5,5)) moves to where? It should move to the new position, but the positions are updated sequentially.\n\nAfter move:\n\n- New head: (5,6)\n\n- New segment 1: previous head position (5,5)\n\n- New segment 2: previous position of segment 1, which was (6,5)? Let's list:\n\nPrevious positions:\n\nIndex 0: head (5,5)\n\nIndex 1: (6,5)\n\nIndex 2: (6,4)\n\nIndex 3: (6,3)\n\nIndex 4: (6,2)\n\nIndex 5: (6,1)\n\nIndex 6: (5,1)\n\nIndex 7: (4,1)\n\nIndex 8: (4,2)\n\nIndex 9: tail (4,3)\n\nAfter moving head to (5,6) without eating:\n\n- New head: (5,6)\n\n- New segment 1: old head position (5,5)\n\n- New segment 2: old segment 1 position (6,5)\n\n- New segment 3: old segment 2 position (6,4)\n\n- New segment 4: old segment 3 position (6,3)\n\n- New segment 5: old segment 4 position (6,2)\n\n- New segment 6: old segment 5 position (6,1)\n\n- New segment 7: old segment 6 position (5,1)\n\n- New segment 8: old segment 7 position (4,1)\n\n- New segment 9: old segment 8 position (4,2)\n\n- Tail is removed, so no segment 9? Snake has 10 segments, after move without eating, length same, so tail is removed, positions from 0 to 9, but new segments up to index 9.\n\nNew positions:\n\n- Head: (5,6) index 0\n\n- Index 1: (5,5)  // old head\n\n- Index 2: (6,5)  // old index 1\n\n- Index 3: (6,4)  // old index 2\n\n- Index 4: (6,3)  // old index 3\n\n- Index 5: (6,2)  // old index 4\n\n- Index 6: (6,1)  // old index 5\n\n- Index 7: (5,1)  // old index 6\n\n- Index 8: (4,1)  // old index 7\n\n- Index 9: (4,2)  // old index 8\n\nOld index 9 was (4,3), which is not included, so the cell (4,3) is freed. But food is at (4,2), which is now occupied by the new tail at index 9.\n\nFood at (4,2) is under the tail now.\n\nSimilarly, if I move in other directions.\n\nBack to turn 42 choices.\n\nIf I move D to (5,4), I eat the food at (5,4), snake grows to 11 segments.\n\nNew positions: head at (5,4), then (5,5) (old head), (6,5) (old seg1), (6,4) (old seg2), (6,3) (old seg3), (6,2) (old seg4), (6,1) (old seg5), (5,1) (old seg6), (4,1) (old seg7), (4,2) (old seg8), (4,3) (old tail, now seg10), and since ate food, tail stays, so (4,3) is now part of body, not tail, tail is still (4,3)? Let's see:\n\nAfter eating:\n\n- Head: (5,4)\n\n- Seg1: (5,5)  // old head\n\n- Seg2: (6,5)  // old seg1\n\n- Seg3: (6,4)  // old seg2\n\n- Seg4: (6,3)  // old seg3\n\n- Seg5: (6,2)  // old seg4\n\n- Seg6: (6,1)  // old seg5\n\n- Seg7: (5,1)  // old seg6\n\n- Seg8: (4,1)  // old seg7\n\n- Seg9: (4,2)  // old seg8\n\n- Seg10: (4,3)  // old tail, new segment\n\nTail is at (4,3).\n\nFood at (4,2) is still under seg9.\n\nNow, life span of (5,4) food: since I ate it on turn 42, it's gone.\n\n(4,2) food still there, under seg9.\n\nLife span 8, so it has until turn 49 to be eaten.\n\nNow, for turn 42, if I move U to (5,6), no food eaten, tail moves to (4,2), food under tail.\n\nIf I move L to (4,5), let's see.\n\nMove L to (4,5) on turn 42.\n\nHead to (4,5), direction L.\n\nNo food at (4,5), so no eat.\n\nNew positions: head (4,5), then (5,5) old head, (6,5) old seg1, (6,4) old seg2, ..., up to new tail at old seg8 position (4,2)? Let's list:\n\nAfter move L to (4,5) without eating:\n\n- Head: (4,5)\n\n- Seg1: (5,5)  // old head\n\n- Seg2: (6,5)  // old seg1\n\n- Seg3: (6,4)  // old seg2\n\n- Seg4: (6,3)  // old seg3\n\n- Seg5: (6,2)  // old seg4\n\n- Seg6: (6,1)  // old seg5\n\n- Seg7: (5,1)  // old seg6\n\n- Seg8: (4,1)  // old seg7\n\n- Seg9: (4,2)  // old seg8\n\nTail removed, so (4,3) freed.\n\nFood at (4,2) is now under seg9, which is the new tail.\n\nSimilarly for other moves.\n\nTo free the food at (4,2), we need the snake to move so that the segment at (4,2) moves away, and then the cell is free for head to move in later.\n\nCurrently, (4,2) is occupied by body, not tail, so when the snake moves, if no food eaten, that segment will move to the next position, freeing (4,2) if the snake moves in a way that it leaves.\n\nBut it's messy.\n\nI should think about the snake's path to avoid dead ends and to access food safely.\n\nAlso, the internal wall at (4,6) might block some areas.\n\nLet's list all occupied cells to see free space.\n\nOccupied cells by snake: (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (4,6)\n\nFree cells: for example, (0,0) to (3,7) except walls, but x=0 and y=0,7 walls, so area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, but with snake and obstacles.\n\nSpecifically, (4,6) is wall, so not free.\n\nFree cells: (1,1) to (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,6), (6,6), (3,1) to (3,3), etc. But (4,4) and (4,5) might be free, (5,4) is free with food, (5,6) free, etc.\n\nFood at (5,4) is free and can be eaten now.\n\nBut let's think about the tail danger for the other food.\n\nFood at (4,2) is under body, and if we free it, and head moves there when tail is adjacent, it could be dangerous.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (4,3), so (4,2) is adjacent to tail.\n\nIf we free (4,2) and head moves there, eating the food, then the tail grows back to where it was, but since head is at (4,2) and tail was at (4,3), after eating, tail doesn't move, so new tail is added at (4,3), and head at (4,2), so they are adjacent, but not colliding because tail is at (4,3) and head at (4,2), different cells. Collision only if head touches body, but when you eat, the new tail is added after the move, so positions: head moves to food cell, then the tail remains for this turn, so the cell where tail was is still occupied, but the new head position is where food was.\n\nWhen head moves to a food cell, it eats it, and the snake grows, so the tail does not move that turn. So the new length is old length +1, with head at new position, and tail unchanged.\n\nSo for example, if head moves to (4,2) when it's free and has food, and tail is at (4,3), then after eating, head at (4,2), body includes the previous positions, and tail still at (4,3) for now. Then on next move, tail may move or not.\n\nBut head at (4,2) and tail at (4,3) are adjacent, but not the same cell, so no collision. Collision only if head moves to a cell occupied by body.\n\nThe rule says: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\" **Tail Reward Danger**: If the head is *adjacent to the tail* and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nSo it's not about the food cell, but the tail cell.\n\nThe danger is when the food is on the tail cell itself, and head is adjacent to tail.\n\nIn this case, for food at (4,2), it is not on the tail cell; tail is at (4,3), food is at (4,2), so different cell.\n\nThe rule says \"the tail cell has positive food\", meaning food is on the same cell as the tail.\n\nIn this state, food at (4,2) is under a body segment, not necessarily the tail.\n\nCurrently, on turn 42, tail is at (4,3), so (4,2) is not tail cell.\n\nIf we move and the tail moves to (4,2), then food is on tail cell.\n\nFor example, if on some turn, the tail is at (4,2) and food is there, and head is adjacent, then eating it would be dangerous.\n\nBut for now, it's not the case.\n\nSo for (4,2) food, it can be eaten safely once freed, as long as when head moves there, it's not adjacent to tail with food on tail cell.\n\nBut since the food is at (4,2), if tail is there, it's on tail cell.\n\nTo eat it safely, we need to move so that when head goes to (4,2), tail is not adjacent and food is not on tail cell.\n\nBut food is fixed at (4,2), so if tail is at (4,2), food is on tail cell, and if head is adjacent, danger.\n\nIf tail is not at (4,2), then food is just on a free cell or under body.\n\nSo to avoid danger, we should eat the food when the tail is not at that cell and not adjacent in a way that causes collision.\n\nBut it's a bit vague.\n\nPerhaps for now, since (4,2) is under body, we can ignore it for immediate action.\n\nBack to turn 42.\n\nI have three choices: U, D, L.\n\nIf I move D to (5,4), I eat the food, get +1, but the snake grows, which might make it harder to maneuver in the crowded area.\n\nThe area around (5,4) has body at (6,4), (5,5), etc.\n\nAfter eating, head at (5,4), then I can move L to (4,4) or D to (5,3).\n\n(5,3) is free, as I thought earlier.\n\nIf I move U to (5,6), I go to a new area, might have more space.\n\n(5,6) is free, and I can explore left or up.\n\nInternal wall at (4,6), so (4,6) is blocked, but (5,6) is ok.\n\nIf I move L to (4,5), I go left, which might be towards the food at (4,2) eventually.\n\nLet's think 5 turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving D on turn 42 to eat the food.\n\nTurn 42: move D to (5,4), eat food, score +1, length 11.\n\nHead at (5,4), direction D.\n\nTurn 43: possible moves L to (4,4) or D to (5,3).\n\nIf I move L to (4,4), head to (4,4), direction L (since moved left).\n\nThen body: head (4,4), seg1 (5,4), seg2 (5,5), seg3 (6,5), etc.\n\nFrom (4,4), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but direction L, so cannot move R.\n\nR would be to (5,4), which is seg1, occupied.\n\nU to (4,5), D to (4,3), L to (3,4).\n\n(4,5) is free? Earlier when we moved, but in this path, after turn 42 D, positions include (5,5), (6,5), etc., (4,5) not occupied, so free.\n\n(4,3) : currently, after turn 42, tail at (4,3), so (4,3) occupied.\n\nAfter turn 42 D move: head (5,4), seg1 (5,5), seg2 (6,5), seg3 (6,4), seg4 (6,3), seg5 (6,2), seg6 (6,1), seg7 (5,1), seg8 (4,1), seg9 (4,2), seg10 (4,3) tail.\n\nSo (4,3) occupied.\n\nOn turn 43, if I move L to (4,4), head to (4,4), then new positions: since no eat, tail moves? I moved to (4,4), which has no food, so no eat, tail moves.\n\nNew head: (4,4)\n\nSeg1: (5,4)  // old head\n\nSeg2: (5,5)  // old seg1\n\nSeg3: (6,5)  // old seg2\n\nSeg4: (6,4)  // old seg3\n\nSeg5: (6,3)  // old seg4\n\nSeg6: (6,2)  // old seg5\n\nSeg7: (6,1)  // old seg6\n\nSeg8: (5,1)  // old seg7\n\nSeg9: (4,1)  // old seg8\n\nSeg10: (4,2)  // old seg9\n\nOld tail (4,3) removed, so (4,3) freed.\n\nFood at (4,2) is now under seg10, the new tail.\n\nHead at (4,4), direction L.\n\nFrom (4,4), possible moves: U to (4,5), D to (4,3) which is now free (since tail moved), but (4,3) was freed, so free cell, no food, L to (3,4), R to (5,4) occupied by seg1.\n\nDirection L, so cannot move R (opposite).\n\nSo possible: U, D, L.\n\n(4,3) is free, so D to (4,3) possible.\n\nThen turn 44: etc.\n\nBut this is getting messy.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid eating the (5,4) food because it might lead to a dead end or reduce space.\n\nThe snake is long, 10 segments, and the grid has limited space.\n\nFree cells: let's count.\n\nGrid 8x8 = 64 cells.\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7; y=0,7; but x=0 and x=7 are full columns, y=0 and y=7 full rows, so 4 sides, but corners shared, so 4*8 - 4 = 32-4=28 wall cells? Let's calculate.\n\nTotal cells: 8x8=64.\n\nBorder walls: x=0: 8 cells, x=7: 8 cells, y=0: but y=0 at x=0 and x=7 already counted, so y=0 for x=1 to 6: 6 cells, similarly y=7 for x=1 to 6: 6 cells.\n\nPlus internal obstacle (4,6), so walls: 8 (x=0) + 8 (x=7) + 6 (y=0) + 6 (y=7) + 1 (4,6) = 29 wall cells.\n\nBut y=0 at x=0 is counted in x=0, similarly for others, so no double count.\n\nx=0: all y, 8 cells.\n\nx=7: all y, 8 cells.\n\ny=0: x=1 to 6, 6 cells (since x=0 and x=7 already included).\n\nSimilarly y=7: x=1 to 6, 6 cells.\n\nInternal (4,6): 1 cell.\n\nTotal walls: 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 + 1 = 29 cells.\n\nSnake: 10 cells.\n\nFood: 2 cells, but one under snake, so occupied.\n\nFree cells: 64 - 29 walls - 10 snake - 1 food under = 24 free cells? But food at (5,4) is free, so free cells including food positions.\n\nEmpty cells: 64 total - 29 walls - 10 snake = 25 cells, but one has food at (5,4), and one has food at (4,2) under snake, so the free cells are 25 - 1 (for (4,2) under) + 1 for (5,4) but (5,4) is free, so 25 cells include (5,4) and other empty, but (4,2) is occupied, so not free.\n\nAvailable cells for movement: 64 - walls - snake occupied = 64 - 29 - 10 = 25 cells, including the food at (5,4) and the cell at (4,2) is occupied, so not available.\n\nThe 25 cells are free and can be moved to, except if food is there, it can be eaten.\n\nOn turn 42, (5,4) is free and has food.\n\nNow, to plan.\n\nPerhaps moving U or L is better to explore more space.\n\nLet's consider moving U on turn 42.\n\nTurn 42: move U to (5,6)\n\nNo eat, so tail moves, new tail at (4,2) with food under.\n\nHead at (5,6), direction U.\n\nFrom (5,6), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but direction U, so cannot move D (opposite).\n\nU to (5,7): but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n\nD to (5,5): but (5,5) is now seg1, occupied, cannot move.\n\nL to (4,6): (4,6) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot move.\n\nR to (6,6): is this free? Walls: not border, not (4,6), so free. Snake positions: after move, head (5,6), seg1 (5,5), seg2 (6,5), etc., no (6,6), so free. Food? No, so possible to move R to (6,6).\n\nOnly possible move is R to (6,6), since U, D, L all invalid or occupied.\n\nU to (5,7) wall, D to (5,5) occupied, L to (4,6) wall, so only R to (6,6) possible.\n\nSo if I move U on turn 42, I am forced to move R on turn 43 to (6,6).\n\nThen on turn 43, move R to (6,6), no food there, so no eat.\n\nHead at (6,6), direction R.\n\nThen possible moves: from (6,6), U to (6,7) wall, D to (6,5) occupied by seg2, L to (5,6) occupied by previous head or seg1? Positions after turn 42 U move: head (5,6), seg1 (5,5), seg2 (6,5), seg3 (6,4), etc.\n\nAfter turn 43 move R to (6,6): head (6,6), seg1 (5,6), seg2 (5,5), seg3 (6,5), seg4 (6,4), ..., and tail at (4,2) with food.\n\nFrom (6,6), possible moves: U to (6,7) wall, D to (6,5) occupied by seg3, L to (5,6) occupied by seg1, R to (7,6) but x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo no possible moves! Dead end, snake dies.\n\nTherefore, moving U on turn 42 leads to death on turn 43 or 44.\n\nSpecifically, on turn 43, after moving to (6,6), no moves possible, so if I must move, I hit wall or body, die.\n\nSo moving U is suicidal. Not good.\n\nTherefore, for turn 42, I should not move U.\n\nNow, move L to (4,5) on turn 42.\n\nTurn 42: move L to (4,5), no eat (no food there), so tail moves, new tail at (4,2) with food under? After move: head (4,5), seg1 (5,5), seg2 (6,5), seg3 (6,4), ..., seg8 (4,1), seg9 (4,2) tail. Food at (4,2) under tail.\n\nHead at (4,5), direction L.\n\nFrom (4,5), possible moves: U to (4,6), but (4,6) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot move.\n\nD to (4,4), is free? Not occupied, no wall, so free.\n\nL to (3,5), free.\n\nR to (5,5), occupied by seg1.\n\nDirection L, so cannot move R anyway.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (4,4) or L to (3,5).\n\nNow, both seem possible.\n\nIf I move D to (4,4), head to (4,4), direction D.\n\nThen from there, I can go down or left, etc.\n\nIf I move L to (3,5), go left.\n\nBut I need to consider the food at (5,4) which has limited life span.\n\nLife span 6, so it will disappear in 6 turns from now, turn 42 to 47 inclusive, gone on 48.\n\nIf I don't eat it soon, I might lose it.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) food has longer life.\n\nBut moving L on turn 42 takes me away from (5,4).\n\nMoving D on turn 42 eats it immediately.\n\nBut let's see if I can eat it later.\n\nFor example, if I move L on turn 42 to (4,5), then on turn 43 I can move D to (4,4), then on turn 44 move L to (3,4) or D to (4,3), but (4,3) might be free or not.\n\nAfter turn 42 L move: positions head (4,5), seg1 (5,5), seg2 (6,5), ..., seg9 (4,2) tail.\n\n(4,3) is freed, so free cell.\n\nOn turn 43, from (4,5), I can move D to (4,4) or L to (3,5).\n\nSay I move D to (4,4) on turn 43.\n\nHead to (4,4), no food, so no eat, tail moves: new tail at old seg8 position (4,1)? After move: head (4,4), seg1 (4,5), seg2 (5,5), seg3 (6,5), ..., seg8 (4,1), seg9 (4,2) but old seg9 is tail, moved, so new seg9 is old seg8 (4,1), and tail removed, so new tail at (4,1)? Let's list:\n\nPrevious after turn 42: head (4,5), seg1 (5,5), seg2 (6,5), seg3 (6,4), seg4 (6,3), seg5 (6,2), seg6 (6,1), seg7 (5,1), seg8 (4,1), seg9 (4,2) tail.\n\nMove head to (4,4) no eat: new head (4,4), seg1 (4,5), seg2 (5,5), seg3 (6,5), seg4 (6,4), seg5 (6,3), seg6 (6,2), seg7 (6,1), seg8 (5,1), seg9 (4,1)  // old seg8, and tail removed, so no (4,2) in body, freed.\n\nFood at (4,2) is now free, since cell freed.\n\nHead at (4,4), direction D.\n\nFrom (4,4), I can move to eat the food at (4,2) or go elsewhere.\n\nBut (4,2) is below, so move D to (4,3)? (4,3) is free, then to (4,2).\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFrom (4,4), possible moves: U to (4,5) occupied by seg1, D to (4,3) free, L to (3,4) free, R to (5,4) which has food, and is free? (5,4) is not occupied, has food.\n\nDirection D, so cannot move U (opposite).\n\nSo possible: D to (4,3), L to (3,4), R to (5,4).\n\nR to (5,4) would eat the food there.\n\nBut on turn 44.\n\nTurn 43: I am at (4,4) after moving from (4,5).\n\nTurn 43 action is move D to (4,4).\n\nThen turn 44: from (4,4), I can move R to (5,4) to eat the food at (5,4).\n\n(5,4) is still there, life span 6, so on turn 44, it has life span decreased to 4? Turn 42: life span 6, so on turn 43, life span 5, turn 44 life span 4, etc.\n\nBut it can be eaten.\n\nIf I move R to (5,4) on turn 44, I eat it.\n\nSimilarly, I can move D to (4,3) or L to (3,4).\n\nBut let's compare to eating it immediately on turn 42.\n\nIf I eat on turn 42, I get the score sooner, and snake grows, but I might be in a tighter spot.\n\nIf I eat later, I have more flexibility now.\n\nBut the food at (5,4) might be eaten by moving D now.\n\nAnother risk: if I don't eat it, and later I can't reach it in time.\n\nFor example, if I move L on turn 42, then to eat (5,4) on turn 44, I can, as above.\n\nSimilarly, the food at (4,2) is now free after turn 43 in this path.\n\nIn the path where I move L on turn 42 and D on turn 43, on turn 43, when I move to (4,4), the cell (4,2) is freed, so food at (4,2) is available.\n\nThen on turn 44, from (4,4), I can move D to (4,3), then on turn 45 move D to (4,2) to eat it, or directly if possible, but from (4,4) to (4,2) not adjacent, so need two moves.\n\n(4,4) to (4,3) to (4,2).\n\nBut (4,3) is free.\n\nAlso, I can move to (5,4) first.\n\nBut let's prioritize.\n\nSince I need to think long-term, and maximize score, eating both foods is good.\n\nBut (4,2) has longer life, so I can eat (5,4) first.\n\nNow, for turn 42, moving L seems better than U, since U leads to death.\n\nMoving D eats immediately.\n\nBut let's see the head direction after moves.\n\nIf I move D on turn 42, head at (5,4), direction D, then I can move L or D.\n\nIf I move L on turn 42, head at (4,5), direction L, then I can move D or L.\n\nTo avoid potential dead ends, moving L might open more space.\n\nThe area to the left is less occupied.\n\nFor example, after moving L to (4,5), I can then move L to (3,5) or D to (4,4).\n\nSay on turn 42 move L to (4,5).\n\nThen on turn 43, I can move L to (3,5) to explore left.\n\nOr D to (4,4) to go down.\n\nSince (5,4) food has short life, I should eat it soon.\n\nSo perhaps on turn 43, after moving to (4,5), I can move R to (5,5)? But (5,5) is occupied by seg1, and direction L, so cannot move R (opposite), so only D or L.\n\nIf I move D to (4,4), then on turn 44 I can move R to (5,4) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, if I move L to (3,5) on turn 43, I am farther away.\n\nSo moving D to (4,4) on turn 43 allows me to eat (5,4) on turn 44.\n\nTurn 44 is within life span; life span 6 from turn 42, so on turn 44, it has 4 turns left? Life span decreases each turn, including current.\n\nOn turn 42, life span 6, so it exists on turns 42,43,44,45,46,47, gone on 48.\n\nOn turn 44, it is still there.\n\nEating on turn 44 is fine.\n\nSimilarly, eating on turn 42 is also fine.\n\nBut if I eat on turn 42, I have a longer snake now, which might make moving harder.\n\nFor example, after eating on turn 42, head at (5,4), then if I move L to (4,4) on turn 43, as before, then from (4,4), I can move D to (4,3) or L to (3,4), etc.\n\n(4,3) is free after tail moves.\n\nIn that case, I can go to (4,3), then to (4,2) to eat the other food, but (4,2) is under body.\n\nAfter turn 42 D move, (4,2) is under seg9, not free.\n\nTo free it, I need to move the snake so that the segment moves away.\n\nBut it's complicated.\n\nPerhaps for simplicity, on turn 42, move L to (4,5).\n\nThen on turn 43, move D to (4,4).\n\nThen on turn 44, move R to (5,4) to eat the food at (5,4).\n\nThen snake grows, head at (5,4), direction R.\n\nThen I can go from there.\n\nAlso, on turn 43, when I moved to (4,4), the cell (4,2) was freed, so food at (4,2) is now available on the grid.\n\nAfter turn 43 move D to (4,4), positions: head (4,4), seg1 (4,5), seg2 (5,5), seg3 (6,5), seg4 (6,4), seg5 (6,3), seg6 (6,2), seg7 (6,1), seg8 (5,1), seg9 (4,1) tail.\n\nAnd (4,2) is free with food.\n\nSo on turn 44, I move R to (5,4), eat food, head at (5,4), direction R.\n\nThen new positions: head (5,4), seg1 (4,4), seg2 (4,5), seg3 (5,5), seg4 (6,5), seg5 (6,4), seg6 (6,3), seg7 (6,2), seg8 (6,1), seg9 (5,1), seg10 (4,1) tail.\n\nNow, from (5,4), direction R, possible moves: U to (5,5) occupied by seg3, D to (5,3) free, L to (4,4) occupied by seg1, R to (6,4) occupied by seg5.\n\nDirection R, so cannot move L (opposite).\n\nU and D: U to (5,5) occupied, D to (5,3) free, so only possible move D to (5,3).\n\nSo must move D to (5,3).\n\nTurn 45: move D to (5,3), no food there, so no eat, tail moves.\n\nNew head (5,3), seg1 (5,4), etc., tail at (4,1) or something.\n\nThen from (5,3), I can move to eat the food at (4,2) or other.\n\n(4,2) is free with food, and from (5,3), I can move L to (4,3) then to (4,2), or directly to (4,2) not adjacent.\n\n(5,3) to (4,3) is left, then to (4,2) down.\n\nBut (4,3) should be free.\n\nAfter turn 45 move to (5,3), positions shift, (4,3) might be free.\n\nBut I need to plan the actions.\n\nFor turn 42, moving L then D then R to eat on turn 44 seems feasible.\n\nIf I move D on turn 42, I eat immediately, but then on turn 43 I have fewer choices, and must move to (4,4) or (5,3), and the snake is longer.\n\nIn the above path, I eat on turn 44, same as eating on turn 42 for the food, but I have two more turns of movement with shorter snake, which might be better for maneuvering.\n\nEating on turn 44 vs turn 42, the score is the same, but the snake grows later, so I have more space for two turns.\n\nAlso, the food at (4,2) is freed earlier in the L-then-D path.\n\nIn D-immediate path, (4,2) is still under body.\n\nSo moving L on turn 42 might be better.\n\nThen I can plan to eat both foods.\n\nAfter eating (5,4) on turn 44, I can go to (4,2).\n\nOn turn 45, from (5,3), after moving D from (5,4), head at (5,3), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R, but direction D, cannot move U.\n\nU to (5,4) occupied by seg1.\n\nD to (5,2), free? Not wall, not occupied, so free.\n\nL to (4,3), free.\n\nR to (6,3), occupied by body.\n\nSo possible: D to (5,2) or L to (4,3).\n\nIf I move L to (4,3), head to (4,3), no food, so tail moves.\n\nThen from (4,3), I can move D to (4,2) to eat the food.\n\n(4,2) has food, so eat it.\n\nThen get another +1.\n\nSo in this path:\n\nTurn 42: move L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 43: move D to (4,4)\n\nTurn 44: move R to (5,4) eat first food\n\nTurn 45: move D to (5,3)  // from (5,4) move D to (5,3)\n\nTurn 46: from (5,3) move L to (4,3)  // to approach (4,2)\n\nThen turn 47: move D to (4,2) eat second food\n\nBut on turn 47, food at (5,4) is gone? Life span 6, from turn 42, gone on turn 48? Exists turns 42-47, so on turn 47 it is still there, but I ate it on turn 44.\n\n(4,2) food life span 8, turns 42-49, so on turn 47 it is there.\n\nIn turn 46, I move to (4,3), which is adjacent to (4,2).\n\nThen on turn 47, move D to (4,2), eat food.\n\nBut is there tail danger?\n\nWhen I move to (4,2), tail is at some position.\n\nOn turn 46: after turn 45 move to (5,3), positions: let's trace.\n\nAfter turn 44: head (5,4), seg1 (4,4), seg2 (4,5), seg3 (5,5), seg4 (6,5), seg5 (6,4), seg6 (6,3), seg7 (6,2), seg8 (6,1), seg9 (5,1), seg10 (4,1) tail.\n\nTurn 45: move D to (5,3), no food, so no eat, tail moves.\n\nNew head (5,3), seg1 (5,4), seg2 (4,4), seg3 (4,5), seg4 (5,5), seg5 (6,5), seg6 (6,4), seg7 (6,3), seg8 (6,2), seg9 (6,1), seg10 (5,1)  // old seg9, and tail removed, so new tail at (5,1)? Old seg10 was (4,1), not included, so (4,1) freed.\n\nPositions: new head (5,3), seg1 (5,4), seg2 (4,4), seg3 (4,5), seg4 (5,5), seg5 (6,5), seg6 (6,4), seg7 (6,3), seg8 (6,2), seg9 (6,1), and since no eat, length 11, but after move, segments from 0 to 10? Snake length after eating on turn 44 is 11, then on turn 45 move without eating, length still 11, but tail moves, so positions: head new, then seg1 to seg10, but seg10 is the last.\n\nAfter turn 44: 11 segments, indices 0 to 10: 0:(5,4) head, 1:(4,4), 2:(4,5), 3:(5,5), 4:(6,5), 5:(6,4), 6:(6,3), 7:(6,2), 8:(6,1), 9:(5,1), 10:(4,1) tail.\n\nTurn 45 move D to (5,3) no eat: new head (5,3), then new seg1: old head (5,4), new seg2: old seg1 (4,4), new seg3: old seg2 (4,5), new seg4: old seg3 (5,5), new seg5: old seg4 (6,5), new seg6: old seg5 (6,4), new seg7: old seg6 (6,3), new seg8: old seg7 (6,2), new seg9: old seg8 (6,1), new seg10: old seg9 (5,1), and old tail (4,1) removed, so no (4,1) in body.\n\nTail is at (5,1).\n\nHead at (5,3), direction D.\n\nTurn 46: move L to (4,3), head to (4,3), direction L.\n\n(4,3) should be free, no food.\n\nNo eat, so tail moves: new tail at old seg9 position (6,1)? After move: head (4,3), seg1 (5,3), seg2 (5,4), seg3 (4,4), seg4 (4,5), seg5 (5,5), seg6 (6,5), seg7 (6,4), seg8 (6,3), seg9 (6,2), seg10 (6,1) tail.\n\nOld seg10 was (5,1), removed.\n\n(4,2) is free with food.\n\nTurn 47: from (4,3), move D to (4,2), eat food.\n\nHead to (4,2), direction D (since moved down).\n\nThen snake grows to 12.\n\nNow, check if tail danger: when I move to (4,2), tail is at (6,1), not adjacent, so no danger.\n\nEat safely.\n\nThen I have eaten both foods.\n\nIn this sequence, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the answer format is to list actions for current and future turns, but I don't know how many to list. The user said \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output actions, probably for the next few turns, but not specified.\n\nIn the answer format, it says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I should list a sequence.\n\nSince t1=42, I can list from turn 42 to, say, turn 47 or so.\n\nIn the above, I have a plan.\n\nBut on turn 42, I moved L, which is possible.\n\nWhat about moving D immediately?\n\nIf I move D on turn 42, eat, then turn 43 must move L or D.\n\nIf move L to (4,4), then from (4,4) I can move to (4,3) or (3,4), but (4,2) is still under body, not free.\n\nTo free (4,2), I need to move the snake so that the segment at (4,2) moves.\n\nIn the D-immediate case, after turn 42, (4,2) is seg9.\n\nWhen I move, if I don't eat, it may shift.\n\nBut it might take more turns to free it.\n\nWhereas in the other path, I freed it earlier.\n\nAlso, in the L-first path, I ate the first food later but with shorter snake temporarily.\n\nNow, for the sequence:\n\nTurn 42: move L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 43: move D to (4,4)\n\nTurn 44: move R to (5,4) eat food\n\nThen turn 45: from (5,4) move D to (5,3) (only choice)\n\nThen turn 46: from (5,3) move L to (4,3)\n\nTurn 47: from (4,3) move D to (4,2) eat food\n\nBut on turn 45, after moving to (5,3), I could move D to (5,2) instead of L to (4,3), but to eat (4,2), I need to go left.\n\nIn turn 46, moving to (4,3) then to (4,2).\n\nIs there a shorter way? From (5,3) to (4,2) not adjacent, so need two moves.\n\nAfter eating on turn 44, I could go directly, but from (5,4), I must move D to (5,3), then from there to (4,3) or (4,2).\n\n(5,3) to (4,2) is diagonal, not allowed, only orthogonal.\n\nSo must go through (4,3) or (5,2) then to (4,2), but (5,2) might be free.\n\nBut (4,2) is at (4,2), so from (5,3), moving L to (4,3) is direct, then down to (4,2).\n\nMoving D to (5,2) would be away.\n\nSo better to go left.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 45: move D to (5,3)\n\nTurn 46: move L to (4,3)\n\nTurn 47: move D to (4,2) eat\n\nNow, on turn 47, food at (5,4) is still there? No, eaten on turn 44.\n\n(4,2) food life span 8, on turn 47 it is still there (turns 42-49).\n\nAfter eating on turn 47, I can continue, but I need to output actions.\n\nThe user might want actions for about 5 turns or so.\n\nSince t1=42, I can list from 42 to 46 or 47.\n\nIn the plan, turn 42: L, turn 43: D, turn 44: R, turn 45: D, turn 46: L, turn 47: D.\n\nBut turn 45 D is from (5,4) to (5,3), etc.\n\nTo confirm safety: in all these moves, no collision or wall hit.\n\nTurn 42: move L to (4,5), free.\n\nTurn 43: move D to (4,4), free.\n\nTurn 44: move R to (5,4), has food, eat.\n\nTurn 45: move D to (5,3), free.\n\nTurn 46: move L to (4,3), free.\n\nTurn 47: move D to (4,2), eat.\n\nAll should be safe.\n\nIf I move D on turn 42, I eat immediately, but then I might not be able to eat the second food easily, or it takes longer.\n\nFor example, after turn 42 D, head at (5,4), turn 43 move L to (4,4), then from (4,4) I can move D to (4,3) or L to (3,4), etc.\n\nBut to eat (4,2), I need to free it first.\n\nCurrently (4,2) is under seg9.\n\nWhen I move, on turn 43, if I move to (4,4), no eat, then positions shift: if no eat, tail moves, but seg9 might move.\n\nAfter turn 42: positions with (4,2) as seg9.\n\nAfter turn 43 move L to (4,4) no eat: head (4,4), seg1 (5,4), seg2 (5,5), ..., seg9 (4,1) or something.\n\nEarlier: after turn 42 D: head (5,4), seg1 (5,5), seg2 (6,5), seg3 (6,4), seg4 (6,3), seg5 (6,2), seg6 (6,1), seg7 (5,1), seg8 (4,1), seg9 (4,2), seg10 (4,3) tail.\n\nTurn 43 move L to (4,4) no eat: new head (4,4), seg1 (5,4), seg2 (5,5), seg3 (6,5), seg4 (6,4), seg5 (6,3), seg6 (6,2), seg7 (6,1), seg8 (5,1), seg9 (4,1), seg10 (4,2)  // old seg9, and tail removed, so new tail at (4,2)? Old tail (4,3) removed.\n\nNew positions: head (4,4), seg1 (5,4), seg2 (5,5), seg3 (6,5), seg4 (6,4), seg5 (6,3), seg6 (6,2), seg7 (6,1), seg8 (5,1), seg9 (4,1), seg10 (4,2) tail.\n\nSo (4,2) is now tail with food under it.\n\nThen to eat it, I need head adjacent and move there, but if head moves to (4,2), it might be dangerous if adjacent to tail, but tail is at (4,2), same cell? Head moving to (4,2) where tail is, but it's occupied, cannot move to occupied cell.\n\n(4,2) is occupied by tail, so head cannot move there directly.\n\nI need to move so that the tail moves away first.\n\nFor example, if I move from (4,4) to (4,3), but (4,3) was freed, free cell.\n\nMove D to (4,3) on turn 44.\n\nThen positions: head (4,3), seg1 (4,4), etc., tail at (4,2) still with food.\n\nThen from (4,3), I can move D to (4,2), but (4,2) has tail, occupied, cannot move.\n\nUnless the tail moves when I move.\n\nOn turn 44, if I move to (4,3) no eat, then tail moves: from above, after turn 43, tail at (4,2).\n\nMove head to (4,3) no eat: new head (4,3), seg1 (4,4), seg2 (5,4), ..., seg10 (4,1) or something, and tail removed, so (4,2) freed, food available.\n\nThen on turn 45, from (4,3), I can move D to (4,2) to eat.\n\nBut in this case, I eat on turn 45, whereas in the other path I ate on turn 47, but in other path I ate the first food on turn 44, second on 47.\n\nIn this D-immediate path, I ate first on turn 42, second on turn 45.\n\nBut I have a longer snake during turns 43-44.\n\nIn terms of turns, eating both by turn 45 vs turn 47, but not much difference.\n\nHowever, in the L-first path, I have more space initially.\n\nMoreover, in the D-immediate path, when I move to (4,4) on turn 43, I might have fewer options.\n\nBut both possible.\n\nSince the L-first avoids the potential issue with moving U, and I have a clear plan, I'll go with that.\n\nSo for output:\n\nTurn 42: L\n\nTurn 43: D\n\nTurn 44: R (to eat food)\n\nThen for future, I can add.\n\nBut the answer should include the actions.\n\nSince the user said \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", I should list actions for 5 turns or so.\n\nt1=42, so turns 42 to 46 or 47.\n\nIn my sequence:\n\nTurn 42: L\n\nTurn 43: D\n\nTurn 44: R\n\nTurn 45: D (from (5,4) to (5,3))\n\nTurn 46: L (to (4,3))\n\nThen I can stop or add more.\n\nBut on turn 47 I eat the second food, but I can list up to 46.\n\nTo be complete, but perhaps 5 actions: 42 to 46.\n\nTurn 42,43,44,45,46: that's 5 turns.\n\nActions: L, D, R, D, L\n\nThen on turn 47, move D to eat, but not listed.\n\nI can list until the eat if possible.\n\nBut the format doesn't specify how many.\n\nI think listing 5 actions is fine.\n\nTo maximize, but since I thought ahead, I have a plan.\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 44 I move R to (5,4) to eat, which is good.\n\nNow, for the boxed answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned a sequence of moves that prioritizes eating both positive food items safely. The key considerations are:\n\n- **Food at (5,4)**: Value +1, life span 6 (disappears after turn 47). It is currently accessible and should be eaten soon due to its shorter life span.\n- **Food at (4,2)**: Value +1, life span 8 (disappears after turn 49). It is under the snake's body and must be freed before being eaten. Eating it requires ensuring the head is not adjacent to the tail when consumed to avoid the \"Tail Reward Danger\".\n- **Snake position and direction**: Head at (5,5) moving left. The snake is long (10 segments), so maneuvering in the crowded right/bottom area requires care to avoid dead ends. Moving up on turn 42 leads to a dead end by turn 43, so it must be avoided.\n- **Strategy**: \n  - First, move left to (4,5) on turn 42 to explore less crowded areas and set up a path to free and eat both foods.\n  - Then, move down to (4,4) on turn 43 to position for eating the food at (5,4) and free the food at (4,2).\n  - Eat the food at (5,4) by moving right on turn 44.\n  - After eating, the only safe move is down to (5,3) on turn 45 to avoid collisions.\n  - Move left to (4,3) on turn 46 to approach the freed food at (4,2).\n  - On turn 47, move down to (4,2) to eat the second food safely (tail is not adjacent, so no danger).\n\nThis sequence eats both foods by turn 47, scores +2, and avoids all collisions and dead ends. Thinking 5+ turns ahead confirms this path maximizes score while maintaining open space for future moves.\n\n**Action Sequence (Turns 42 to 46):**\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 42: L (left)  \nTurn 43: D (down)  \nTurn 44: R (right)  \nTurn 45: D (down)  \nTurn 46: L (left)\n} \n\n**Continuation beyond turn 46 (for context, not required in output):**  \n- Turn 47: D (down) to (4,2) to eat the second food.  \n- Further moves can explore the left area (e.g., moving to (3,3) or (4,3)) to avoid walls and body segments.",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 43, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The walls are at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (4,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but with walls on the borders and that one obstacle.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (4,5), then body segments: (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2). That's 10 segments. Head direction is left, so last move was to the left, from (5,5) to (4,5).\n\nFood:\n\n- (5,4) with life span 5, value +1 (positive food)\n\n- (4,2) with life span 7, value +1\n\n- (6,2) with life span 10, value +1\n\nAll food is positive here, no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for all, and life span given.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid visually to understand positions.\n\nGrid size: 8x8, coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls on all borders, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also, internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake: head (4,5), body: (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2). So the tail is at (4,2).\n\nFood: (5,4), (4,2), (6,2)\n\n(4,2) is also a body segment? Snake positions include (4,2) as the last segment, which is the tail. But food is at (4,2)? That might be a problem.\n\nFood at (4,2) with life span 7, but snake is currently on (4,2) as the tail segment.\n\nAccording to the rules: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nAlso, \"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and newly grown tail collide.\n\nCurrent head position: (4,5)\n\nTail position: (4,2)\n\nAre they adjacent? (4,5) and (4,2) are three cells apart vertically, not adjacent. Adjacent would be sharing an edge, like (4,5) and (4,4) or (4,5) and (3,5), etc. (4,5) to (4,2) has (4,4) and (4,3) in between, so not adjacent.\n\nNow, food at (4,2) is under the tail. Since the tail will move when the snake moves, if the snake doesn't grow, the tail will leave (4,2), and then if head moves to (4,2), it can eat the food, but only if the food is still there and life span hasn't expired.\n\nSimilarly, food at (6,2) is also under a body segment? Snake has (6,2) as a segment? Let's see snake positions: (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), so (6,2) is the fourth segment from head? Positions: index 0: head (4,5), 1: (5,5), 2: (6,5), 3: (6,4), 4: (6,3), 5: (6,2), 6: (6,1), 7: (5,1), 8: (4,1), 9: tail (4,2).\n\nSo (6,2) is position 5, a body segment, and food is at (6,2) with life span 10. So food is under the body.\n\nFood at (5,4) is not under snake, I think. (5,4) is not in snake positions: snake has (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), etc., but not (5,4). (5,4) is empty? Let's list all occupied cells by snake: (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2). So (5,4) is not occupied, so food at (5,4) is on an empty cell.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) is occupied by tail, (6,2) occupied by body.\n\nNow, current head direction is left, so from (5,5) to (4,5), moving left.\n\nPossible moves from (4,5): since head direction is L, I can move L, U, D, but not R because that would be instant reverse? Rules: \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nCurrent direction is L, so opposite is R. So cannot move right immediately. Possible moves: Left, Up, Down.\n\nCoordinates: moving U: (x,y+1) = (4,6)\n\nD: (x,y-1) = (4,4)\n\nL: (x-1,y) = (3,5)\n\nR: not allowed.\n\nBut (4,6) is an obstacle? Internal obstacle at (4,6), and walls at y=7, but (4,6) is given as internal obstacle, so cannot move there.\n\nWalls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacle (4,6).\n\nSo (4,6) is occupied by wall, so cannot move up to (4,6).\n\nSimilarly, moving down to (4,4): is that free? Snake has segments at (6,4), (6,3), etc., but (4,4) is not in snake positions, so should be free, but let's check.\n\nSnake positions: (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2). So (4,4) is not occupied, and not a wall, so should be free.\n\nMoving left to (3,5): not a wall, not occupied? (3,5) not in snake positions, so free.\n\nMoving right to (5,5) is not allowed because reverse, and also (5,5) is body segment, so collision if I move there.\n\nSo possible moves from (4,5):\n\n- U: (4,6) but obstacle, invalid\n\n- D: (4,4) free\n\n- L: (3,5) free\n\n- R: not allowed\n\nSo only Down or Left is possible? U is invalid, R invalid, so only D or L.\n\nBut D is to (4,4), L to (3,5).\n\nNow, I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n\nFirst, let's consider the food.\n\nFood at (5,4): life span 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n\nCurrent turn t=43, life span 5, so it will disappear at turn 43 + 5 - 1? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for food at (5,4), life_span=5, on turn t=43, countdown is 5. After this turn, if not eaten, countdown becomes 4, then 3,2,1, and on turn 47 it disappears? Let's see:\n\nAt turn t, countdown = life_span.\n\nAfter each turn, countdown decreases by 1.\n\nWhen countdown reaches 0, food disappears.\n\nSo for food with life_span L at turn t:\n\n- At turn t, countdown = L\n\n- After turn t (i.e., after action), countdown becomes L-1 if not eaten\n\n- ...\n\n- After k turns, countdown = L - k\n\n- When L - k = 0, food disappears at the end of that turn, I think. But since it can be eaten during the turn, probably when the head moves to it during a turn, it is eaten before countdown decrease.\n\nThe rule doesn't specify the order, but typically, in such games, the food is eaten if head moves to it, and countdown decreases after the move or something.\n\nTo be precise: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at the start of turn, or end?\n\nI think it's safer to assume that at the beginning of turn, before action, the countdown is as given. After the action, if food not eaten, countdown decreases.\n\nBut the state gives the food with life span at current turn.\n\nFor turn t=43, food (5,4) has life_span=5, so countdown=5 at start of turn 43.\n\nAfter my action this turn, if I don't eat it, countdown becomes 4 for turn 44, and so on, until turn 47: at start of turn 47, countdown=1, after action, if not eaten, it decreases to 0 and disappears.\n\nSimilarly, food at (4,2) life_span=7, so from turn 43, countdown=7, disappears after turn 49 if not eaten.\n\nFood at (6,2) life_span=10, countdown=10, disappears after turn 52.\n\nNow, since (4,2) and (6,2) are under snake body, I can only eat them if the body moves away and head moves there.\n\nFor (4,2), it is the tail, so when the snake moves without growing, the tail moves, so (4,2) is vacated. Then head can move to (4,2) to eat, but only if food is still there.\n\nSimilarly for (6,2), it is a body segment, not tail, so it will only move when the snake grows or the segment is passed.\n\nLet's think about the snake movement.\n\nSnake has 10 segments. If I eat food, length increases by 1, so 11 segments. If not, length same.\n\nCurrently, no food is adjacent to head; head is at (4,5), food at (5,4) is one cell away diagonally? (5,4) is down-right from (4,5), but not adjacent directly; adjacent cells are (4,6) invalid, (4,4) down, (3,5) left, (5,5) right but occupied.\n\n(5,4) is not adjacent to (4,5); to reach (5,4) from (4,5), I need to move down to (4,4) or right to (5,5), but (5,5) is occupied.\n\nFrom (4,5), to go to (5,4), I need to move down to (4,4), then right to (5,4), or something.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, I need to choose an action for turn 43.\n\nPossible actions: Down to (4,4) or Left to (3,5).\n\nIf I go down to (4,4), what happens? Snake moves: head to (4,4), then body follows: segment 1 from (5,5) to (4,5)? Let's see the movement.\n\nWhen snake moves, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo if head moves to (4,4), then:\n\n- New head: (4,4)\n\n- Segment 1 (was (5,5)) moves to head old position (4,5)\n\n- Segment 2 (was (6,5)) moves to segment 1 old position (5,5)\n\n- Segment 3 (was (6,4)) moves to (6,5)\n\n- Segment 4 (was (6,3)) moves to (6,4)\n\n- Segment 5 (was (6,2)) moves to (6,3)\n\n- Segment 6 (was (6,1)) moves to (6,2)\n\n- Segment 7 (was (5,1)) moves to (6,1)\n\n- Segment 8 (was (4,1)) moves to (5,1)\n\n- Segment 9 (was (4,2)) moves to (4,1)\n\n- Tail was segment 9, now moves to (4,1), so tail is now at (4,1)\n\nOld tail was at (4,2), now moved to (4,1).\n\nFood at (4,2) is now exposed, since body moved away.\n\nSimilarly, food at (6,2): segment 5 was at (6,2), now moved to (6,3), so (6,2) is now occupied by segment 6? After move: segment 5 is at (6,3), segment 6 is at (6,2), which is the old position of segment 5? Let's list new positions after moving down to (4,4):\n\n- Head: (4,4)\n\n- Body: 1: (4,5)  // old head\n\n2: (5,5)  // old segment1\n\n3: (6,5)  // old segment2\n\n4: (6,4)  // old segment3\n\n5: (6,3)  // old segment4\n\n6: (6,2)  // old segment5? Old segment5 was (6,2), but now segment6 moves to old segment5 position.\n\nOld positions:\n\n- Head: (4,5)\n\n- Seg1: (5,5)\n\n- Seg2: (6,5)\n\n- Seg3: (6,4)\n\n- Seg4: (6,3)\n\n- Seg5: (6,2)\n\n- Seg6: (6,1)\n\n- Seg7: (5,1)\n\n- Seg8: (4,1)\n\n- Seg9: (4,2)  // tail\n\nAfter head moves to (4,4):\n\n- Head: (4,4)\n\n- Seg1: to (4,5)  // old head\n\n- Seg2: to (5,5)  // old seg1\n\n- Seg3: to (6,5)  // old seg2\n\n- Seg4: to (6,4)  // old seg3\n\n- Seg5: to (6,3)  // old seg4\n\n- Seg6: to (6,2)  // old seg5\n\n- Seg7: to (6,1)  // old seg6\n\n- Seg8: to (5,1)  // old seg7\n\n- Seg9: to (4,1)  // old seg8? Old seg8 was (4,1), so seg9 moves to (4,1)? But seg8 was at (4,1), and seg9 was at (4,2), so when seg8 moves to old seg7 position (5,1)? I think I confused.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to new cell, each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n\nSo positions after move:\n\n- New position 0: head at (4,4)\n\n- New position 1: old position 0, which was (4,5)\n\n- New position 2: old position 1, which was (5,5)\n\n- New position 3: old position 2, which was (6,5)\n\n- New position 4: old position 3, which was (6,4)\n\n- New position 5: old position 4, which was (6,3)\n\n- New position 6: old position 5, which was (6,2)\n\n- New position 7: old position 6, which was (6,1)\n\n- New position 8: old position 7, which was (5,1)\n\n- New position 9: old position 8, which was (4,1)\n\nBut old position 9 was (4,2), which is now vacated because no segment moves to it; the tail was at old pos9, and since no growth, the tail moves away, so (4,2) is empty now.\n\nSimilarly, for (6,2), it was old pos5, now new pos6 is at (6,2), because new pos6 is old pos5 which was (6,2), so it's still occupied.\n\nLet's clarify:\n\n- Old pos5: (6,2)\n\n- After move, new pos6 is at old pos5, so (6,2) is still occupied by segment (new pos6).\n\n- Old pos9: (4,2) was tail, and since no growth, it moves to new pos9 at old pos8 (4,1), so (4,2) is vacated.\n\nSo after moving down to (4,4), the cell (4,2) is now free, and food is there, but since body moved away, the food is now accessible if head moves there later.\n\nBut head is at (4,4) now.\n\nFood at (6,2) is still under body, occupied by new pos6.\n\nFood at (5,4) is at (5,4), which is not occupied by snake now. New snake positions: (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1). So (5,4) is free.\n\nIf I had moved left to (3,5) instead.\n\nBut let's first consider the down move.\n\nAfter moving down to (4,4) at turn 43, head direction now is down, since I moved down.\n\nThen for turn 44, possible moves from (4,4): U, D, L, R.\n\nU: (4,5) but that's now body segment (new pos1), occupied, collision.\n\nD: (4,3) is it free? Not in snake positions, not wall.\n\nL: (3,4) free\n\nR: (5,4) free, and has food.\n\nAlso, walls: (4,3) is within bounds, y=3>0, x=4 between 0 and 7, not border.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4), (5,4) should be free.\n\n(5,4) has food, value +1.\n\nSo from (4,4), I can move to (5,4) to eat the food, but I need to think ahead.\n\nLife span of (5,4) is 5 at turn 43, so after turn 43 action, if not eaten, countdown decreases to 4 for turn 44.\n\nIf I move to (5,4) on turn 44, I can eat it.\n\nBut let's see the tail position.\n\nIf I eat on turn 44, snake grows, so new tail added.\n\nBut first, let's simulate if I go down on turn 43.\n\nTurn 43: move down to (4,4)\n\nThen snake positions: as above, head (4,4), body: (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)\n\nTail at (4,1)\n\nFood: (5,4) countdown now 4 (after turn 43, not eaten), (4,2) countdown 6 (since life span 7, decreased by 1 after turn 43), similarly (6,2) countdown 9.\n\n(4,2) is now free, food there.\n\nNow turn 44, from (4,4), I can move:\n\n- U: (4,5) occupied, invalid\n\n- D: (4,3) free\n\n- L: (3,4) free\n\n- R: (5,4) free, has food\n\nIf I move R to (5,4), eat food, snake grows to 11 segments.\n\nHead moves to (5,4), then body: new head (5,4), segment 1 moves to old head (4,4), segment 2 to (4,5), and so on, up to segment 10 to old segment 9 (4,1), and since growth, a new segment is added at the position where tail was, but tail was at (4,1), so new tail at (4,1), but since it grows, the tail doesn't move, so positions: head (5,4), then (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1) — 11 segments, tail at (4,1).\n\nFood at (5,4) eaten, so removed.\n\nThen head direction is right.\n\nBut is there any risk?\n\n(5,4) is safe, no collision.\n\nNow, after eating, the snake is longer, which might make it harder to maneuver, but I have food to consider.\n\nAnother option: from (4,4), I could move down to (4,3) or left to (3,4).\n\nBut moving right to eat (5,4) seems good, since it has short life span, only 4 left on turn 44, and if I don't eat it soon, it disappears.\n\nLife span was 5 at turn 43, after turn 43, countdown 4, so on turn 44, if I eat it, I get it, else it might disappear soon.\n\nIf I don't eat on turn 44, after turn 44, countdown 3, and so on.\n\nBut since I can eat it on turn 44, and it's safe, I should.\n\nBut let's think about the other food.\n\nFood at (4,2) is now free, at (4,2), which is adjacent to tail? Tail is at (4,1) after turn 43.\n\n(4,2) and (4,1) are adjacent vertically.\n\nBut \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n\nHere, food is at (4,2), tail is at (4,1). Head is at (4,4).\n\nTo eat food at (4,2), head needs to move to (4,2).\n\nFrom (4,4), if I move down to (4,3), then to (4,2), but when I move to (4,2), the tail might have moved.\n\nAlso, the food at (4,2) has life span 7, decreased to 6 after turn 43, so plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) still under body.\n\nBack to turn 43 action.\n\nIf I move left to (3,5) on turn 43.\n\nTurn 43: move left to (3,5)\n\nHead to (3,5), direction left.\n\nThen body moves: new head (3,5), segment 1 to old head (4,5), segment 2 to (5,5), segment 3 to (6,5), segment 4 to (6,4), segment 5 to (6,3), segment 6 to (6,2), segment 7 to (6,1), segment 8 to (5,1), segment 9 to (4,1), tail was at (4,2), moves to (4,1)? Old tail at (4,2), since no growth, it moves to old segment 8 position (4,1)? Similar to before.\n\nAfter move:\n\n- Head: (3,5)\n\n- Seg1: (4,5)\n\n- Seg2: (5,5)\n\n- Seg3: (6,5)\n\n- Seg4: (6,4)\n\n- Seg5: (6,3)\n\n- Seg6: (6,2)\n\n- Seg7: (6,1)\n\n- Seg8: (5,1)\n\n- Seg9: (4,1)  // tail\n\n(4,2) vacated, food there.\n\n(6,2) still occupied by seg6.\n\nFood (5,4) not eaten, countdown decreases to 4 after turn 43.\n\nFrom (3,5), possible moves for turn 44: U, D, L, R? Direction is left, so cannot move right (opposite).\n\nCurrent direction left, so cannot move right to (4,5) which is occupied anyway.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nU: (3,6) - is it wall? y=6, borders y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=6 not wall, x=3 not wall, and not occupied? New snake positions: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1). So (3,6) free.\n\nD: (3,4) free\n\nL: (2,5) free\n\nR: not allowed\n\nAlso, internal obstacle at (4,6), not affecting (3,6).\n\nSo from (3,5), I can go U to (3,6), D to (3,4), or L to (2,5).\n\nNo immediate food access.\n\nFood at (5,4) is at (5,4), which is two moves away: e.g., from (3,5), I could go to (3,4), then to (4,4), then to (5,4), but that takes two moves, and (5,4) countdown is 4 at turn 44 start, so if I move to (5,4) on turn 45, after turn 44 action, countdown decreases to 3, then on turn 45, I can eat if I reach.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach in time.\n\nFrom turn 43, if I moved left to (3,5), on turn 44 I can move down to (3,4), then on turn 45 move right to (4,4), then on turn 46 move right to (5,4), but (5,4) countdown: at turn 44 start, countdown=4, after turn 44 not eaten, countdown=3, after turn 45 not eaten, countdown=2, then on turn 46 I move to (5,4), I can eat it with countdown=2? When I move on turn 46, countdown is 2 at start, I eat it, so it should be fine.\n\nBut I need to get to (5,4) by turn 46.\n\nFrom (3,5) at turn 44, if I go down to (3,4), then turn 45 to (4,4), turn 46 to (5,4).\n\nBut on turn 46, (5,4) countdown: turn 44 start: 4, after turn 44: 3, turn 45 start:3, after turn 45 not eaten:2, turn 46 start:2, I move to (5,4), eat it, countdown decreases after? But since I eat it, it's consumed.\n\nSimilarly, if I had moved down on turn 43, I could eat on turn 44.\n\nMoving down on turn 43 allows me to eat (5,4) one turn earlier, with less risk of it disappearing, and I get the food sooner.\n\nAlso, moving down might be better for accessing other areas.\n\nNow, about the food at (4,2): it's now free after any move, since tail moves away.\n\nBut to eat it, head needs to go to (4,2).\n\nCurrently, after turn 43, if I moved down, head at (4,4), tail at (4,1).\n\n(4,4) to (4,2) is two cells down, but (4,3) might be free.\n\nIf I moved left, head at (3,5), tail at (4,1), farther.\n\nAlso, there's food at (6,2), which is still under body, but when the snake moves, it might be exposed later.\n\nFor example, the segment at (6,2) is new pos6 after down move, which is body, not tail.\n\nTo vacate (6,2), I need the snake to move in a way that this segment is not occupied, but since it's not tail, it will only move when the snake grows or the body shifts.\n\nSpecifically, (6,2) will be vacated when the segment that was there moves away, which happens when the snake moves without growing for a few steps, but it's messy.\n\nPerhaps I should focus on the immediate choice.\n\nAnother thing: the grid has limited space, and with walls and obstacle, I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nFor example, after moving down to (4,4), I have options.\n\nIf I then eat (5,4) on turn 44, head at (5,4), direction right.\n\nThen for turn 45, from (5,4), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nU: (5,5) but (5,5) is body segment (after growth, it's there), in the positions: after eating on turn 44, snake: (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)\n\nSo (5,5) is occupied.\n\nD: (5,3) free? Not occupied.\n\nL: (4,4) occupied\n\nR: (6,4) occupied by body.\n\nSo only possible moves: U not possible, D to (5,3), L not possible, R not possible, so only down to (5,3).\n\nThen from (5,3), I can move, etc.\n\nBut let's not go too deep yet.\n\nIf I don't eat on turn 44, from (4,4) I could go down to (4,3) or left to (3,4).\n\nBut (5,4) has short life, so I should eat it soon.\n\nSimilarly, if I moved left on turn 43, I might not reach (5,4) in time or at all.\n\nFor instance, from (3,5), to reach (5,4), I need to go to (4,4) then (5,4), but (4,4) might be occupied later.\n\nAt turn 44, from (3,5), if I go down to (3,4), then turn 45 to (4,4), but at turn 45, (4,4) might be free or not, depending on snake.\n\nBut if I didn't move to (4,4) earlier, it should be free.\n\nIn the left move scenario, at turn 44 from (3,5) to (3,4), then turn 45 from (3,4) to (4,4), then turn 46 to (5,4).\n\nBut on turn 46, (5,4) countdown might be low.\n\nTurn 43: (5,4) countdown 5\n\nAfter turn 43 not eaten: 4\n\nTurn 44 start:4, after not eaten:3\n\nTurn 45 start:3, after not eaten:2\n\nTurn 46 start:2, I move to (5,4), eat it, ok.\n\nBut with down move, I eat on turn 44, which is better.\n\nAlso, after eating, I have a longer snake, which might be riskier, but I need to score.\n\nNow, about the food at (4,2): it's at (4,2), with life span 7, so after turn 43, countdown 6.\n\nAfter turn 44, if not eaten, 5, etc.\n\nHead at (4,4) after turn 43 down move, I can go down to (4,3) on turn 44 instead of eating (5,4).\n\nBut (5,4) is a sure food with short life, while (4,2) has longer life.\n\nBut (4,2) is near the tail.\n\nIf I go to (4,3), then to (4,2), but when I move to (4,2), the tail is at (4,1), so head at (4,2), tail at (4,1), adjacent, and if I eat food there, I grow, so new tail added at current tail position, which is (4,1), so head at (4,2), new tail at (4,1), so they are adjacent, and since I just moved to (4,2), the new tail is at (4,1), so no immediate collision, but after the move, head and tail are adjacent, which might be risky for future moves, but not necessarily deadly unless I move into the tail.\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger\": only if I eat the food when head is adjacent to the tail and the food is on the tail cell.\n\nHere, food is at (4,2), which is not the tail cell; tail is at (4,1), so eating (4,2) should be fine, as long as I don't move into the tail after.\n\nFor example, if I move to (4,2) from (4,3), and tail is at (4,1), I eat, grow, so new positions: head at (4,2), body: previous head (4,3), then rest, and new tail at (4,1), so head at (4,2), tail at (4,1), adjacent, but not collided yet. Then if I move down to (4,1), I collide with tail, or if I move left/right, ok.\n\nBut it's a bit dangerous.\n\nWhereas if I eat (5,4), it's safer.\n\nNow, the food at (6,2) is under body, and to eat it, I need the body to move away.\n\nCurrently, after down move, (6,2) is occupied by segment.\n\nThe segment at (6,2) will move when the snake moves, but it will be occupied by the next segment unless the tail moves past it.\n\nSince it's not the tail, it might take many moves to vacate it, especially if the snake doesn't grow.\n\nFor example, the cell (6,2) will be vacated only when the segment that was there moves and no new segment comes, which happens when the tail moves beyond that point, but since the snake is long, it might take time.\n\nPerhaps it's not worth pursuing soon.\n\nLife span 10, so I have time.\n\nBut let's think long-term.\n\nThe grid is 8x8 with borders and one obstacle, so space is limited.\n\nSnake is 10 long, so I need to avoid boxing myself in.\n\nFor example, after moving down to (4,4) and eating (5,4), I am at (5,4) with 11 segments.\n\nThen as I said, only can move down to (5,3) on turn 45.\n\nThen from (5,3), direction down, so possible moves: L, R, D, but not U (reverse).\n\nU: (5,4) occupied\n\nD: (5,2) free?\n\nL: (4,3) free? \n\nR: (6,3) occupied by body.\n\nSnake positions after turn 44: head (5,4), body (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)\n\nFrom (5,4) move down to (5,3) on turn 45? Turn 45 action.\n\nAfter turn 44: head at (5,4), after eating.\n\nFor turn 45, from (5,4), only possible move is down to (5,3), since U to (5,5) occupied, L to (4,4) occupied, R to (6,4) occupied.\n\nD to (5,3) should be free.\n\nAssume (5,3) is free.\n\nMove to (5,3), then new head (5,3), body moves: seg1 to (5,4), seg2 to (4,4), seg3 to (4,5), etc., down to tail at (4,1).\n\nNow head at (5,3), direction down.\n\nPossible moves for turn 46: U, D, L, R.\n\nU: (5,4) occupied\n\nD: (5,2) free? Not occupied\n\nL: (4,3) free\n\nR: (6,3) occupied by body (in positions, (6,3) is there)\n\nSo can move down to (5,2) or left to (4,3).\n\nIf I go left to (4,3), then towards the food at (4,2).\n\n(4,2) has food, and tail is at (4,1) or something.\n\nAfter moving to (5,3), positions: head (5,3), seg1 (5,4), seg2 (4,4), seg3 (4,5), seg4 (5,5), seg5 (6,5), seg6 (6,4), seg7 (6,3), seg8 (6,2), seg9 (6,1), seg10 (5,1), tail (4,1)? Last is (4,1).\n\nTail at (4,1).\n\nFood at (4,2) is at (4,2), free.\n\nFrom (5,3), I can move left to (4,3) on turn 46.\n\nThen from (4,3), I can move down to (4,2) to eat the food on turn 47.\n\nBut when I move to (4,2), tail is at (4,1), so adjacent, and I eat, grow, so new tail at (4,1), head at (4,2), adjacent, not collided, but risky if I move down next.\n\nLife span of (4,2): at turn 43, life span 7, countdown 7.\n\nAfter turn 43: 6\n\nTurn 44: if not eaten, 5\n\nTurn 45: 4\n\nTurn 46: 3\n\nTurn 47: 2, so on turn 47 I can eat it.\n\nSimilarly, if I don't eat on turn 44, I can go directly to (4,2).\n\nBut let's go back to turn 43 decision.\n\nIf I move left on turn 43 to (3,5), then I might not get the (5,4) food easily, and it might disappear.\n\nFor example, from (3,5), I can go to (3,4) on turn 44, then to (4,4) on turn 45, then to (5,4) on turn 46, but (4,4) might be free, and (5,4) countdown 2 on turn 46, I can eat.\n\nBut in the down move case, I eat on turn 44, which is better for scoring and reduces risk of missing it.\n\nAlso, after eating, I have more options or not.\n\nAnother point: the internal obstacle at (4,6) blocks the top row, but since y=6 is not wall, but (4,6) is obstacle, so (4,6) is blocked.\n\nIn the current position, moving up is not possible.\n\nBut with head at (4,5), moving down or left.\n\nMoving left might open up the left side.\n\nFor example, from (3,5), I can go left to (2,5), etc., but the food is on the right.\n\nFood at (5,4) is only available for a short time.\n\nPerhaps I should prioritize eating (5,4) since it has short life span.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) has longer life, (6,2) longer.\n\nSo for turn 43, moving down to (4,4) allows me to eat (5,4) on turn 44.\n\nMoving left to (3,5) delays that.\n\nMoreover, with down move, I can then access (4,2) food later.\n\nAlso, about the tail food: after moving down on turn 43, (4,2) is free, and I can plan to eat it when head is not adjacent to tail, but it might be hard.\n\nFor example, after eating (5,4) on turn 44, head at (5,4), then down to (5,3) on turn 45, then to (4,3) on turn 46, then to (4,2) on turn 47.\n\nAt turn 47, when I move to (4,2), tail is at (4,1) or where?\n\nAfter turn 45: head at (5,3), positions as above.\n\nTurn 46: move left to (4,3), head to (4,3), then body: seg1 to (5,3), seg2 to (5,4), etc., tail to (5,1) or something.\n\nLet's simulate:\n\nAfter turn 45: head at (5,3), body: (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1) — 11 segments.\n\nTail at (4,1)\n\nTurn 46: move left to (4,3)\n\nHead to (4,3), then seg1 to (5,3), seg2 to (5,4), seg3 to (4,4), seg4 to (4,5), seg5 to (5,5), seg6 to (6,5), seg7 to (6,4), seg8 to (6,3), seg9 to (6,2), seg10 to (6,1), and since no growth, tail moves to old seg10 position? Old seg10 is (5,1)? Positions: 11 segments.\n\nNew positions after move to (4,3):\n\n- Head: (4,3)\n\n- Seg1: old head (5,3)\n\n- Seg2: old seg1 (5,4)\n\n- Seg3: old seg2 (4,4)\n\n- Seg4: old seg3 (4,5)\n\n- Seg5: old seg4 (5,5)\n\n- Seg6: old seg5 (6,5)\n\n- Seg7: old seg6 (6,4)\n\n- Seg8: old seg7 (6,3)\n\n- Seg9: old seg8 (6,2)\n\n- Seg10: old seg9 (6,1)\n\n- But old seg10 was (5,1), which is vacated, tail was at (4,1), but old tail is not moved to; since no growth, the last segment moves to the position of the previous last, but in the chain, the segment that was tail moves away.\n\nOld positions: index 0: (5,3), 1: (5,4), 2: (4,4), 3: (4,5), 4: (5,5), 5: (6,5), 6: (6,4), 7: (6,3), 8: (6,2), 9: (6,1), 10: (5,1) — tail (5,1)\n\nAfter head to (4,3):\n\n- New 0: (4,3)\n\n- New 1: old0 (5,3)\n\n- New 2: old1 (5,4)\n\n- New 3: old2 (4,4)\n\n- New 4: old3 (4,5)\n\n- New 5: old4 (5,5)\n\n- New 6: old5 (6,5)\n\n- New 7: old6 (6,4)\n\n- New 8: old7 (6,3)\n\n- New 9: old8 (6,2)\n\n- New 10: old9 (6,1)\n\nOld tail (5,1) vacated.\n\nFood at (4,2) is still there.\n\nNow head at (4,3), I can move down to (4,2) on turn 47 to eat the food.\n\nThen, when I move to (4,2), tail is at new10 (6,1), which is not adjacent; (4,2) to (6,1) not adjacent, so safe to eat.\n\nThen I grow to 12 segments.\n\nSimilarly, the food at (6,2) might be accessible later.\n\nBut let's not go too far.\n\nFor turn 43, moving down seems better to get the short-life food.\n\nIf I move left on turn 43, I might miss (5,4).\n\nFor example, if I move left to (3,5), then on turn 44 I go down to (3,4), turn 45 to (4,4), turn 46 to (5,4), but on turn 46, (5,4) countdown might be 2 or 1, but I can eat it.\n\nBut it's later, and I have to make multiple moves.\n\nWith down move, I eat on turn 44, one turn earlier.\n\nAlso, in terms of position, after eating (5,4), I am at (5,4), which is closer to the center, and I can go down to open space.\n\nWhereas on left, I am at (3,5), which might be near wall, but not immediately.\n\nx=0 is wall, so from (3,5) I can go left to (2,5), etc.\n\nBut the food (5,4) is only available for a few turns.\n\nMoreover, all food is positive, so no penalty, so eating is good.\n\nTherefore, for turn 43, I should move down to (4,4).\n\nThen on turn 44, from (4,4), I should move right to (5,4) to eat the food.\n\nThen on turn 45, from (5,4), move down to (5,3).\n\nThen from there, I can go left to (4,3), then down to (4,2) to eat the other food.\n\nBut I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nLet's outline the plan.\n\nTurn 43: move Down to (4,4)\n\nTurn 44: move Right to (5,4) eat food, grow to 11\n\nTurn 45: from (5,4), only Down to (5,3) possible? Earlier I thought U,L,R blocked, only D.\n\nAfter eating on turn 44, positions: head (5,4), body: (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)\n\nFrom (5,4), moves:\n\n- U: (5,5) occupied\n\n- D: (5,3) free? Assuming yes\n\n- L: (4,4) occupied\n\n- R: (6,4) occupied\n\nSo only D to (5,3)\n\nTurn 45: move Down to (5,3)\n\nThen head at (5,3), body: seg1 to (5,4), seg2 to (4,4), etc. as before.\n\nNow from (5,3), direction down.\n\nPossible moves for turn 46:\n\n- U: (5,4) occupied\n\n- D: (5,2) free\n\n- L: (4,3) free\n\n- R: (6,3) occupied (since (6,3) is body)\n\nSo can go Down to (5,2) or Left to (4,3)\n\nI want to eat the food at (4,2), so better to go left to (4,3)\n\nTurn 46: move Left to (4,3)\n\nThen head at (4,3), as in earlier simulation.\n\nNow from (4,3), direction left (since I moved left from (5,3)).\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R? Direction left, so cannot move right.\n\nU: (4,4) occupied? After move to (4,3), positions: head (4,3), seg1 (5,3), seg2 (5,4), seg3 (4,4), seg4 (4,5), seg5 (5,5), seg6 (6,5), seg7 (6,4), seg8 (6,3), seg9 (6,2), seg10 (6,1), tail at (6,1)? Earlier: new seg10 at (6,1)\n\nIn positions: after turn 46 move to (4,3):\n\n- Head: (4,3)\n\n- Seg1: old head (5,3)\n\n- Seg2: old seg1 (5,4)\n\n- Seg3: old seg2 (4,4)\n\n- Seg4: old seg3 (4,5)\n\n- Seg5: old seg4 (5,5)\n\n- Seg6: old seg5 (6,5)\n\n- Seg7: old seg6 (6,4)\n\n- Seg8: old seg7 (6,3)\n\n- Seg9: old seg8 (6,2)\n\n- Seg10: old seg9 (6,1)\n\nOld seg10 (5,1) vacated.\n\nTail at (6,1)\n\nFood at (4,2) is at (4,2), free.\n\nFrom (4,3), possible moves:\n\n- U: (4,4) occupied by seg3\n\n- D: (4,2) free, has food\n\n- L: (3,3) free\n\n- R: (5,3) occupied by seg1\n\nDirection is left, so cannot move right to (5,3) anyway.\n\nCan move down to (4,2) or left to (3,3)\n\nTo eat the food, move down to (4,2) on turn 47.\n\nTurn 47: move Down to (4,2) eat food, grow to 12 segments.\n\nHead to (4,2), then body: new head (4,2), seg1 to old head (4,3), seg2 to (5,3), ..., and new segment added at old tail position (6,1), so tail now at (6,1), but since growth, tail doesn't move, new tail at (6,1).\n\nPositions: head (4,2), seg1 (4,3), seg2 (5,3), seg3 (5,4), seg4 (4,4), seg5 (4,5), seg6 (5,5), seg7 (6,5), seg8 (6,4), seg9 (6,3), seg10 (6,2), seg11 (6,1) — 12 segments.\n\nFood at (4,2) eaten.\n\nNow, about the other food at (6,2): it was under body, but after these moves, (6,2) is now occupied by seg10, since we added a segment.\n\nIn the new positions, (6,2) is seg10, so still under body.\n\nTo eat it, I need to vacate it.\n\nBut it might be possible later.\n\nLife span 10, at turn 43 countdown 10, after several turns, it decreases.\n\nTurn 43: 10\n\nAfter t43:9\n\nt44:8 (since not eaten)\n\nt45:7\n\nt46:6\n\nt47:5\n\nAfter turn 47, if not eaten, countdown 4, etc.\n\nSo still time.\n\nNow, after eating (4,2), head at (4,2), direction down (since I moved down).\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R? Direction down, so cannot move up.\n\nU: (4,3) occupied by seg1\n\nD: (4,1) — is it free? Not occupied now, but walls? y=1>0, not wall.\n\nBut (4,1) was previously occupied, but now free? In current positions, no, (4,1) not in list, so free.\n\nL: (3,2) free\n\nR: (5,2) free? Not occupied.\n\nBut R to (5,2) might be possible.\n\nFirst, U not possible, D to (4,1), L to (3,2), R to (5,2)\n\n(4,1) is above y=0, so not wall.\n\nBut moving down to (4,1) might be towards tail or something, but tail is at (6,1), not adjacent.\n\nI can choose.\n\nBut I need to think about the future.\n\nSince the snake is long, I should avoid tight spaces.\n\nFor example, the bottom-left area might be cramped.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nI think for now, with the plan above, I can eat two foods by turn 47.\n\nNow for turn 43, moving down is the best to start this.\n\nIf I move left on turn 43, I might not get (5,4).\n\nFor example, suppose turn 43 move left to (3,5)\n\nTurn 44: from (3,5), say move down to (3,4)\n\nTurn 45: from (3,4) move right to (4,4)\n\nBut on turn 45, (4,4) might be free, but snake positions: after turn 44, head at (3,4), body: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1) tail at (4,1)? Old tail at (4,2) moved to (4,1) or something.\n\nAfter turn 43 move left: head (3,5), body (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1) tail (4,1) — (4,2) vacated.\n\nTurn 44 move down to (3,4): head (3,4), body seg1 (3,5), seg2 (4,5), ..., seg9 (5,1), seg10 (4,1) tail (4,1)\n\n(4,2) free with food.\n\nNow turn 45 from (3,4) move to (4,4): (4,4) should be free, move right to (4,4)\n\nThen from (4,4), I can move to (5,4) on turn 46, but (5,4) countdown: turn 45 start, after two decreases: turn 43 not eaten, countdown 4 to 3? Turn 43: countdown 5, after not eaten:4\n\nTurn 44: start 4, not eaten:3\n\nTurn 45: start 3, not eaten:2? After turn 45 action not eaten:2\n\nThen turn 46 move to (5,4), eat with countdown 2, ok.\n\nBut I eat later, and I might eat (4,2) first or something.\n\nBut in this case, from (4,4) on turn 45, I can instead move down to (4,3), then to (4,2) to eat that food.\n\nBut (5,4) might disappear if I don't go soon.\n\nWith short life, better to prioritize (5,4).\n\nIn down move, I eat it earlier.\n\nTherefore, for turn 43, move down is better.\n\nSo action for turn 43: Down\n\nThen turn 44: Right to eat (5,4)\n\nTurn 45: Down to (5,3)\n\nThen turn 46: Left to (4,3)\n\nTurn 47: Down to (4,2) to eat (4,2)\n\nNow, I need to think about the food at (6,2). It is under body and might be hard to reach soon. Since life span is long, I can plan later.\n\nAfter turn 47, I can consider moving towards the right or something.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the format says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but output for the current and future turns.\n\nThe answer format is to output for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't specify how many turns, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should output at least 5 turns.\n\nCurrent turn t1=43, so output turns 43 to 48 or something.\n\nBut I have a plan for 43 to 47.\n\nFor turn 48, I can think briefly.\n\nAfter turn 47, head at (4,2), direction down, positions as above.\n\nThen possible moves: D to (4,1), L to (3,2), R to (5,2)\n\n(4,1) might be free, and not wall.\n\nI can move down to (4,1), but then from there, options might be limited.\n\nMove right to (5,2), then I can go to (6,2) but (6,2) has food under body? Currently, after turn 47, (6,2) is occupied by seg10, as above.\n\nTo eat (6,2), I need to vacate it.\n\nFor example, if I move in a way that the snake tail moves away from that area.\n\nBut it might take time.\n\nSince I have eaten two foods, and snake is long, I should focus on survival and not take risks.\n\n(6,2) has life span 10, after several turns, countdown decreased to about 4 or 5, so I can try to get it later.\n\nFor turn 48, from (4,2), I can move right to (5,2) to go to the right side.\n\nThen from (5,2), etc.\n\nBut I don't need to specify too far.\n\nFor the answer, I'll output turns 43 to 47 as per plan.\n\nBut turn 47 is eating (4,2), which is fine.\n\nNow, to confirm the actions:\n\nTurn 43: Down\n\nTurn 44: Right (to eat (5,4))\n\nTurn 45: Down (to (5,3))\n\nTurn 46: Left (to (4,3))\n\nTurn 47: Down (to (4,2) to eat (4,2))\n\nNow, for turn 48, I can add, say, move Left to (3,2) or something, but it might not be necessary.\n\nSince the format might expect multiple turns, I can add one more.\n\nAfter turn 47, head at (4,2), direction down.\n\nMove, say, left to (3,2) on turn 48.\n\nBut let's not overcomplicate.\n\nI think outputting 5 turns is fine.\n\nt43 to t47 is 5 actions: 43,44,45,46,47.\n\nt43, t44, t45, t46, t47 — that's 5 turns.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the plan, all moves are valid and safe.\n\nNo collision risks in these moves.\n\nAlso, for the food at (6,2), I can leave it for now.\n\nSo I think this is a good plan.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned at least 5 turns ahead. The key considerations are:\n- **Food Prioritization**: The food at (5,4) has a short life span (countdown 5 at turn 43) and must be eaten soon to avoid missing it. The food at (4,2) has a longer life span (countdown 7) and can be targeted later. The food at (6,2) is under the body and has a long life span (countdown 10), making it less urgent.\n- **Movement Safety**: Avoid walls, obstacles, and body collisions. The snake cannot reverse direction instantly. After eating, the snake grows, increasing length but also risk; maneuvers must avoid dead ends.\n- **Path Efficiency**: The plan starts by moving down to access (5,4) quickly, then proceeds to (4,2) for the second food, ensuring both are eaten before their life spans expire. The snake's position after eating (4,2) allows flexibility for future moves.\n\n### Plan Details (Turns 43 to 47):\n1. **Turn 43 (Current Turn)**: Move **Down (D)** to (4,4). This avoids the obstacle at (4,6) and positions the head to reach (5,4) next turn. The tail moves away from (4,2), exposing the food there. (5,4) countdown decreases to 4 after this turn.\n2. **Turn 44**: Move **Right (R)** to (5,4) to eat the positive food (+1 score, length increases to 11). This is safe and captures the short-life food before it disappears (countdown 3 after this turn if uneaten). Head direction is now right.\n3. **Turn 45**: Move **Down (D)** to (5,3). From (5,4), only down is possible (up, left, and right are blocked by body segments). This avoids collisions and heads toward (4,2). Head direction is now down.\n4. **Turn 46**: Move **Left (L)** to (4,3). This continues the path to (4,2) and avoids the body at (6,3). Head direction is now left.\n5. **Turn 47**: Move **Down (D)** to (4,2) to eat the positive food (+1 score, length increases to 12). This is safe as the tail is at (6,1), not adjacent, so no \"Tail Reward Danger.\" The food at (4,2) has countdown ~2-3 at this point (from initial 7, decreased over turns).\n\n### Why this plan?\n- **Efficiency**: Eats both accessible foods ( (5,4) and (4,2) ) by turn 47, maximizing score with minimal risk.\n- **Risk Mitigation**: All moves avoid walls, obstacles, and body collisions. After turn 47, the head is at (4,2) with direction down, allowing flexible moves (e.g., to (4,1), (3,2), or (5,2)) for future survival.\n- **Long-term**: The food at (6,2) (countdown ~4-5 by turn 48) can be targeted later by maneuvering to vacate the cell. Survival is prioritized—after turn 47, the snake has room to navigate the bottom-left area.\n\n### Output for Turns 43 to 47:\n\\boxed{\nTurn 43: D (down)  \nTurn 44: R (right)  \nTurn 45: D (down)  \nTurn 46: L (left)  \nTurn 47: D (down)  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. It's turn 44, and I have to plan my moves for the next few turns to maximize score while avoiding risks. I should think at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nThe grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7, and one internal obstacle at (4,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (4,4), and the body segments follow: (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1). The head direction is down (D), which means it's moving downward.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (5,4) with value 1 and life span 4. So it disappears after 4 turns, including this one? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so if life span is 4 on turn 44, it will disappear after turn 47? Let's calculate: on turn 44, life span 4; after turn 44, it decreases to 3; turn 45, to 2; turn 46, to 1; turn 47, to 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 44, 45, 46, or 47.\n\n- (4,2) with value 1 and life span 6. Similarly, disappears after turn 49? Turn 44:6, 45:5, 46:4, 47:3, 48:2, 49:1, 50:0 gone. So available until turn 49.\n\n- (6,2) with value 1 and life span 9. Available for many turns.\n\nAll food has value +1, so all positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n\nNow, the snake head is at (4,4) moving down. From the positions, the head is at (4,4), and next segment is (4,5), which is above it, so since head is moving down to (4,4) from previous position? Let's see the positions list: [(4,4), (4,5), (5,5), ...]. Head is first, so at turn 44, head is at (4,4), and it came from (4,5) since the next segment is (4,5). But head direction is given as D, down. So from (4,5) to (4,4), that is moving down, yes.\n\nNow, possible moves: since head is moving down, I can't move up immediately because of no instant reverse. So possible directions: down, left, or right? Let's see the surroundings.\n\nHead at (4,4). Possible moves:\n\n- Down: to (4,3) but y=3, and walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=3 is within bounds. But is (4,3) occupied? Snake positions: (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1). (4,3) is not in the list, so it should be free. Similarly, (6,3) is occupied by the body, but (4,3) is not.\n\nLet's list all occupied cells by snake: (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1). So (4,3) is free.\n\n- Left: to (3,4). x=3, y=4. Walls: x=0 and x=7 borders, so x=3 is fine. (3,4) not in snake positions, so free.\n\n- Right: to (5,4). (5,4) is a food position? Food at (5,4) is present, but let's see if it's occupied. Snake positions don't have (5,4), only (6,4) and (4,4), so (5,4) is free and has food.\n\n- Up: but head direction is down, so moving up would be reverse, which is not allowed. No instant reverse rule. So up is invalid.\n\nSo possible moves from (4,4) with direction D: down to (4,3), left to (3,4), or right to (5,4).\n\n(5,4) has food with value 1 and life span 4.\n\nNow, I need to think about risks and long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's look at the food at (6,2). But (6,2) is occupied by the snake! Snake positions include (6,2), which is part of the body. But food can spawn under the body, and it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves there.\n\nSimilarly, food at (5,4) is not under snake, I think. (5,4) is not in snake positions, so it's accessible.\n\nFood at (4,2) is not occupied.\n\nBut (6,2) has food, but it's currently under the snake body at (6,2). So to eat it, the snake must move so that the body leaves (6,2), and then head moves to it.\n\nCurrently, (6,2) is occupied by the 6th segment? Positions: index 0: head (4,4), 1: (4,5), 2: (5,5), 3: (6,5), 4: (6,4), 5: (6,3), 6: (6,2), 7: (6,1), 8: (5,1), 9: (4,1). So (6,2) is segment at index 6.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the tail moves away only if it doesn't grow. When it eats food, it grows, so tail doesn't move.\n\nBut for food under body, it can be eaten only if the body moves away (meaning the snake moves without growing, so tail moves), and then head moves to that cell.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nFirst, let's find where the tail is. Tail is the last segment, (4,1).\n\nNow, adjacent cells to tail: (4,1) can be adjacent to (4,0), (4,2), (3,1), (5,1). But (4,0) is wall (y=0), (3,1) and (5,1) may be free or not, (4,2) has food, but (4,2) is not adjacent to head yet.\n\nHead is at (4,4), tail at (4,1), not adjacent.\n\nNow, for the food at (6,2): it's under the body, so to eat it, we need the snake to move so that segment at (6,2) moves away, meaning when the snake moves without eating, the tail moves, and segments shift.\n\nFor example, if snake moves and doesn't eat, the head moves to a new cell, each segment moves to the next position, and the tail cell is vacated.\n\nBut for (6,2), it's not the tail; tail is (4,1). So when snake moves, (6,2) will be occupied by the next segment only if the snake doesn't grow.\n\nLet's simulate a move.\n\nSuppose at turn 44, I move somewhere.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the food at (5,4), which is adjacent and can be eaten now by moving right to (5,4).\n\nBut I should think about risks.\n\nIf I eat (5,4), snake grows, so new head at (5,4), and tail stays, so snake length increases to 11 segments? Currently 10 segments: positions have 10 elements, so length 10.\n\nAfter eating, head moves to food, new segment added, so tail doesn't move. Positions: new head at (5,4), then previous head (4,4) becomes second segment, and so on, up to tail (4,1) still there.\n\nBut (5,4) has food, so if I move right, I eat it.\n\nNow, after eating, snake is longer, which might make it harder to maneuver, but since grid has obstacles, it could be risky.\n\nI should look at the map.\n\nLet me sketch the grid mentally.\n\nGrid 8x8: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- Head: (4,4)\n\n- Body: (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)\n\nSo the snake is mostly on the left and bottom, with a part going right.\n\nFood at:\n\n- (5,4) - near head, can be eaten now.\n\n- (4,2) - below, but (4,2) has food, and snake has segment at (4,1) and (5,1), etc.\n\n- (6,2) - but occupied by snake body at index 6.\n\nAlso, (6,2) has food under it, life span 9, so many turns left.\n\nNow, for the food under (6,2): to eat it, we need the snake to move so that the body leaves (6,2), which happens when the snake moves and the segments shift because it doesn't eat. Then, when (6,2) is free, head can move to it.\n\nBut when the body leaves (6,2), that means the snake did not eat on that turn, so tail moved away from some cell.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nSuppose at some turn, the segment at (6,2) moves to the next position when the snake moves forward without eating.\n\nFor example, if the snake moves in a certain direction, the head goes to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the segment that was at (6,2) will move to where the previous segment was, which depends on the movement.\n\nCurrently, the segments: from head to tail: (4,4) -> (4,5) -> (5,5) -> (6,5) -> (6,4) -> (6,3) -> (6,2) -> (6,1) -> (5,1) -> (4,1)\n\nIf snake moves without eating, say down to (4,3), then new head at (4,3), body: (4,4) becomes first body, (4,5) becomes second, (5,5) third, (6,5) fourth, (6,4) fifth, (6,3) sixth, (6,2) seventh, (6,1) eighth, (5,1) ninth, and tail (4,1) is removed? No, when moving without eating, the tail cell is vacated.\n\nAfter move: head to (4,3), then segments: [ (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1) ] and (4,1) is free now.\n\nPreviously, (6,2) was occupied, now it's still occupied but by a different segment; the segment that was at (6,2) is now at (6,3) or something.\n\nLet's index: before move: pos[0] = (4,4), pos[1] = (4,5), pos[2] = (5,5), pos[3] = (6,5), pos[4] = (6,4), pos[5] = (6,3), pos[6] = (6,2), pos[7] = (6,1), pos[8] = (5,1), pos[9] = (4,1)\n\nAfter moving down to (4,3) without eating: new head at (4,3), then body: pos[0] new head (4,3), pos[1] = old pos[0] = (4,4), pos[2] = old pos[1] = (4,5), pos[3] = old pos[2] = (5,5), pos[4] = old pos[3] = (6,5), pos[5] = old pos[4] = (6,4), pos[6] = old pos[5] = (6,3), pos[7] = old pos[6] = (6,2), pos[8] = old pos[7] = (6,1), pos[9] = old pos[8] = (5,1), and old pos[9] (4,1) is vacated.\n\nSo the cell (6,2) is now occupied by the segment that was at (6,3) before, but it's still occupied. The food at (6,2) is under the body, so it's not accessible until the body moves away.\n\nThe body moves away only if that specific cell is no longer occupied, which happens when the segment that was there moves and no other segment is there, but since segments are connected, when the snake moves, the occupation shifts.\n\nFor (6,2) to be free, the segment that is on it must move, and no new segment comes, which means that when the tail moves away, but (6,2) is not the tail.\n\n(6,2) will be free only when the snake moves such that the segment at (6,2) moves to another cell and no segment replaces it immediately, which happens when that position is abandoned as the snake moves.\n\nIn this case, since (6,2) is not the tail, it will be occupied until the tail passes that point.\n\nFor example, in the above move, after moving down, (6,2) is still occupied by the segment that was at (6,3) before.\n\nTo make (6,2) free, we need the snake to move in a way that the segment at (6,2) moves to a new position and that cell is not filled by another segment, which it won't be if it's not the head or something.\n\nSpecifically, when the snake moves without growing, the tail cell is vacated, but for an intermediate cell like (6,2), it will be vacated only when the segment that was there moves and the cell is not occupied by the next segment, but since the snake is moving, the cells shift, so (6,2) might be occupied by a different segment.\n\nLet's think: the cell (6,2) can be vacated only if it was the tail position and the snake moves without eating, so tail moves away.\n\nBut here, (6,2) is not the tail; tail is (4,1). So to vacate (6,2), we need to move the snake such that the segment at (6,2) is no longer there, which will happen as the snake moves, but the cell might be occupied by another segment if the snake turns.\n\nFor instance, if the snake moves straight, the occupation moves with the snake.\n\nBut for a food to be eaten that is under the body, it requires that the body moves away from that cell, meaning the snake moves so that the cell is no longer occupied, and then the head can move to it.\n\nIn this case, for (6,2), since it's part of the body, it will be occupied until the tail passes that point, which might take several moves.\n\nCurrently, the tail is at (4,1), and the segment at (6,2) is between.\n\nThe distance from (6,2) to tail: from (6,2) to (6,1) to (5,1) to (4,1), so it's 3 segments away from tail? Positions: from head to tail, (6,2) is at index 6, tail at index 9, so 3 segments after it.\n\nWhen the snake moves without eating, the tail moves forward, so the index of each segment decreases in a way.\n\nAfter one move without eating, the segment that was at index 6 is now at index 7, and so on, until it becomes the tail and moves away.\n\nSo to vacate (6,2), we need the snake to move at least 3 times without eating, so that the segment that was at (6,2) becomes the tail and then moves away.\n\nLet's calculate.\n\nBefore any move: tail at (4,1)\n\nAfter one move without eating: tail is at old pos[8] = (5,1)? Old pos[9] is vacated, so tail is now at old pos[8] = (5,1)\n\nThe cell (6,2) is still occupied, by old pos[6] which is now at new pos[7] or something.\n\nIt's messy.\n\nThe cell (6,2) will be vacated when the segment that was on it at turn 44 has moved away, and no other segment is on it, which will happen when that segment is the tail and the snake moves without eating.\n\nAt turn 44, the segment at (6,2) is the 7th segment (index 6, counting from 0).\n\nAfter k moves without eating, that segment will be at position index 6 - k, and when k=6, it will be at index 0, but no.\n\nAfter one move: the segment at old index i is now at new index i+1 for i from 0 to 8, and index 9 is gone.\n\nSo for the segment at old index 6 ( (6,2) ), after one move, it is at new index 7.\n\nAfter two moves, at new index 8.\n\nAfter three moves, at new index 9, which is the tail.\n\nThen after fourth move without eating, that tail moves away, and (6,2) might be free if the snake doesn't occupy it again.\n\nBut during these moves, the snake might occupy (6,2) with other segments if it turns.\n\nTo safely vacate (6,2), we need to move the snake in a way that it doesn't turn back to (6,2), and after 4 moves without eating, the cell (6,2) will be vacated when the tail moves from there.\n\nInitially, segment at (6,2) is index 6.\n\nAfter 3 moves without eating:\n\n- After move 1: that segment is at index 7\n\n- After move 2: at index 8\n\n- After move 3: at index 9 (tail)\n\nThen after move 4 without eating, tail moves to new position, and the old tail position is vacated.\n\nSo at that point, (6,2) is free if it was the tail position at that time.\n\nBut after 3 moves, the segment is at tail position, which may not be (6,2) anymore, depending on movement.\n\nIf the snake moves straight down from current position, for example.\n\nCurrent head at (4,4), moving down.\n\nIf I keep moving down without eating, head to (4,3), then (4,2), then (4,1), but (4,1) is current tail, so when head moves to (4,3), tail is (5,1), etc.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nTurn 44: positions: H(4,4), B1(4,5), B2(5,5), B3(6,5), B4(6,4), B5(6,3), B6(6,2), B7(6,1), B8(5,1), T(4,1)\n\nAfter move down to (4,3) without eating: new positions: H(4,3), B1(4,4), B2(4,5), B3(5,5), B4(6,5), B5(6,4), B6(6,3), B7(6,2), B8(6,1), T(5,1)  -- (4,1) vacated\n\nCell (6,2) is occupied by B7.\n\nAfter another move down to (4,2) without eating: H(4,2), B1(4,3), B2(4,4), B3(4,5), B4(5,5), B5(6,5), B6(6,4), B7(6,3), B8(6,2), T(6,1)  -- (5,1) vacated\n\n(6,2) occupied by B8.\n\nAfter another move down to (4,1) but (4,1) is wall? y=0 is wall, so cannot move to (4,0), but (4,1) is at y=1, not wall. Walls are y=0, so (4,1) is ok, but it was vacated earlier.\n\nAfter second move, T is at (6,1), and (4,1) is free.\n\nMove to (4,1): from H(4,2), move down to (4,1).\n\nBut (4,1) was vacated, so new positions: H(4,1), B1(4,2), B2(4,3), B3(4,4), B4(4,5), B5(5,5), B6(6,5), B7(6,4), B8(6,3), T(6,2)  -- (6,1) vacated\n\n(6,2) is now occupied by T.\n\nAfter another move, say down to (4,0) but y=0 wall, cannot, or other directions.\n\nBut (6,2) is tail.\n\nThen if move without eating, say from (4,1) move left to (3,1) or right to (5,1), etc.\n\nIf move to (3,1), new H(3,1), B1(4,1), B2(4,2), etc., T moves from (6,2) to new position, so (6,2) vacated.\n\nSo after 4 moves without eating, (6,2) can be vacated if the snake moves appropriately.\n\nBut in this case, it took 4 moves to make the segment that was at (6,2) become tail and move away.\n\nBut during this, the food at (6,2) might expire or something, but life span 9, so plenty of time.\n\nHowever, in the process, the head might have other opportunities.\n\nBack to turn 44.\n\nI have three choices: down to (4,3), left to (3,4), or right to (5,4) to eat food.\n\nIf I go right to (5,4), I eat the food, snake grows to length 11.\n\nNew positions: head to (5,4), then body: (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), and new tail added, so positions: [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)] 11 segments.\n\nHead at (5,4), direction would be right, since moved right.\n\nThen from there, I can move down, left, or up? But no reverse, so cannot move left (opposite of right), so possible: down to (5,3), up to (5,5) but (5,5) is body, collision, or right to (6,4) but (6,4) is body, collision.\n\nLet's see surroundings of (5,4):\n\n- Up: (5,5) - occupied by body, collision if move there.\n\n- Down: (5,3) - is it free? Snake positions: (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), and new head (5,4), so (5,3) not listed, so free.\n\n- Left: (4,4) - occupied by body, collision.\n\n- Right: (6,4) - occupied by body, collision.\n\nSo only possible move from (5,4) after eating is down to (5,3).\n\nThen to (5,3), which is free.\n\nDirection down.\n\nThen from (5,3), can move down to (5,2), left to (4,3), right to (6,3).\n\n(6,3) is occupied? In positions, (6,3) is there, so if move right, collision.\n\nPositions after eating: head (5,4), then (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)\n\nSo (5,3) free, (4,3) free, (6,3) occupied.\n\nSo from (5,3), move to (5,2), (4,3), or (5,4) but (5,4) is previous head, now body, collision, so not up.\n\nPossible: down to (5,2), left to (4,3), or right to (6,3) but occupied, so only down or left.\n\nIf down to (5,2), or left to (4,3).\n\nNow, food at (4,2) is below, and (6,2) is occupied.\n\nAlso, there's an internal obstacle at (4,6), but not relevant now.\n\nIf I go to (5,3), then I might go to (4,3) or (5,2).\n\nBut let's think long-term.\n\nPerhaps eating the food at (5,4) is risky because it forces me into a corner; after eating, I can only go down to (5,3), and from there limited options.\n\nAt (5,3), if I go down to (5,2), (5,2) is free? Not occupied, yes.\n\nThen from (5,2), can go down to (5,1) but (5,1) is occupied, or left to (4,2), or right to (6,2) occupied.\n\n(4,2) has food.\n\nSimilarly, if from (5,3) I go left to (4,3), then from (4,3) can go down to (4,2) with food, or left to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut let's consider not eating now.\n\nAlternative: from (4,4), move down to (4,3).\n\nThen head to (4,3), direction down.\n\nNew positions: [ (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1) ] and (4,1) vacated.\n\nTail was (4,1), now gone.\n\nNow, from (4,3), possible moves: down to (4,2), left to (3,3), right to (5,3). Cannot up because reverse.\n\n(4,2) has food, (5,3) free, (3,3) free.\n\nIf I move down to (4,2), I can eat the food there, since it's positive.\n\nFood at (4,2) value 1, life span 6.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows, new head at (4,2), positions: [ (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1) ] and (4,1) was already vacated, so tail is (5,1).\n\nHead at (4,2), direction down.\n\nThen from (4,2), possible moves: down to (4,1), left to (3,2), right to (5,2).\n\n(4,1) is now free? In positions, (4,1) is not there, so free. (3,2) free, (5,2) free.\n\nNo body collisions.\n\nAlso, walls: x=0 left, but (3,2) is ok.\n\nSo all three directions possible.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nIf at (4,3) I don't eat, I could go left or right.\n\nBut eating (4,2) seems fine.\n\nAnother choice: from (4,4) move left to (3,4).\n\nThen head to (3,4), direction left (since moved left).\n\nNew positions: [ (3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1) ] and (4,1) vacated.\n\nFrom (3,4), possible moves: down to (3,3), left to (2,4), up to (3,5). Cannot right, reverse.\n\n(3,3) free, (2,4) free, (3,5) free? (3,5) not occupied, yes.\n\nThen I can explore left area.\n\nBut there is food at (4,2) and (6,2), so moving left might not be towards food.\n\nSimilarly, food at (5,4) is still there, but if I move left, I might not get it soon.\n\nNow, about the food at (6,2) under body: to eat it, I need to vacate (6,2).\n\nAs I thought earlier, it takes several moves without eating to shift the snake so that (6,2) becomes tail and moves away.\n\nCurrently, the segment at (6,2) is index 6, tail at index 9.\n\nAfter 3 moves without eating, that segment will be tail.\n\nThen after fourth move, it moves away.\n\nBut during those moves, the head should be able to reach (6,2) when it's free.\n\nAlso, life span is 9, so on turn 44, it can last until turn 52 or so, plenty of time.\n\nBut I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nMoreover, there is tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nCurrently tail at (4,1), food at (4,2), which is adjacent to tail.\n\n(4,2) is above (4,1), so adjacent vertically.\n\nIf the head moves to (4,2) when the tail is at (4,1), and (4,2) has food, eating it would grow the snake, so new head at (4,2), new tail added, so the tail was at (4,1), new segment at previous tail position? When eating, the head moves to food, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position.\n\nSo if head moves to (4,2), which is food, new head at (4,2), the previous tail remains, and a new tail segment is added at the position where the tail was, so (4,1) still has a segment, and new segment at (4,1)? No.\n\nPositions: before move, tail at (4,1).\n\nHead moves to (4,2), which is food, so new positions: head at (4,2), then the first body segment is previous head position, and so on, up to the previous tail, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position.\n\nSo if previous positions: ..., B8(5,1), T(4,1)\n\nAfter head moves to (4,2) and eats, new positions: H(4,2), B1(previous head), B2, ..., B9(previous B8), B10(previous T), T(new at previous T position)\n\nIn this case, from (4,4) move down to (4,3) first, then to (4,2).\n\nAt turn 44, if I move down to (4,3) without eating, positions as above.\n\nThen from (4,3), if I move down to (4,2), which has food.\n\nBefore move to (4,2), positions: H(4,3), B1(4,4), B2(4,5), B3(5,5), B4(6,5), B5(6,4), B6(6,3), B7(6,2), B8(6,1), T(5,1)\n\nTail at (5,1)\n\nFood at (4,2) is not under tail; tail is at (5,1), (4,2) is free.\n\nHead at (4,3), move down to (4,2), which is food.\n\nNew head at (4,2), then body: B1(4,3), B2(4,4), B3(4,5), B4(5,5), B5(6,5), B6(6,4), B7(6,3), B8(6,2), B9(6,1), T(5,1), and new tail added at previous tail position (5,1)? Previous tail was (5,1), so new tail is at (5,1), but that position is now occupied by B9 or something.\n\nNew positions: H(4,2), B1(4,3), B2(4,4), B3(4,5), B4(5,5), B5(6,5), B6(6,4), B7(6,3), B8(6,2), B9(6,1), T(5,1) -- and new segment at previous tail (5,1), so T is at (5,1), but B9 is at (6,1), so (5,1) has T, but it's the same position? I think I confused.\n\nStandard snake: when eating, head moves to food, the tail does not move, so the new segment is added at the tail position, extending the snake.\n\nSo positions: the new head is at the food cell, the previous head becomes the first body segment, and so on, the previous tail remains, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position, so the tail is now the new segment.\n\nFor example, before move to food: positions [A, B, C, ..., Y, Z] where A head, Z tail.\n\nMove head to food F, which is adjacent.\n\nNew positions: [F, A, B, C, ..., Y, Z] and since eating, a new segment is added at Z, so positions become [F, A, B, C, ..., Y, Z, Z] but Z is a position, so it's [F, A, B, C, ..., Y, Z] with Z now the second last, and new tail at Z.\n\nBetter to think: the list has one more element.\n\nBefore: [P0, P1, P2, ..., P9] P0 head, P9 tail.\n\nAfter moving to food at F: new head at F, then [F, P0, P1, P2, ..., P8, P9] and since eating, new segment at P9, so positions: [F, P0, P1, P2, ..., P8, P9, P9] but P9 is the same position, so it's [F, P0, P1, ..., P8, P9] with P9 now body, and new tail at P9, which is confusing.\n\nThe position of the tail doesn't change; a new segment is added there, so the tail is still at the same cell, but it's a new segment.\n\nFor collision, the cell P9 is occupied by the tail segment.\n\nWhen you add a new segment at the tail position, the old tail is still there, and the new segment is at the same position, so it's still one segment at that cell.\n\nThen when the snake moves next, the tail moves.\n\nIn terms of positions, after eating, the snake has the same positions as after the move, but with an additional segment at the tail position.\n\nBefore move: positions S = [P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk] with P0 head, Pk tail.\n\nMove head to new position F (food), so new head at F.\n\nThe body moves: the new position list is [F, P0, P1, P2, ..., P_{k-1}] and Pk is no longer part of snake? No.\n\nWhen head moves to F, the first body segment moves to P0, second to P1, etc., so the new positions are [F, P0, P1, P2, ..., P_{k-1}] and the tail Pk is removed, but since eating, no removal; instead, the tail stays.\n\nSo new positions: [F, P0, P1, P2, ..., P_{k-1}, Pk] because no removal, and since eating, an additional segment is added at Pk, so the new list is [F, P0, P1, ..., P_{k-1}, Pk, Pk] but that can't be.\n\nI think it's: after moving to food, the positions are [F, P0, P1, ..., P_{k-1}] and then since eating, the segment that was at Pk remains, so positions become [F, P0, P1, ..., P_{k-1}, Pk] with Pk now the second last, and a new segment is added at Pk, but that would be two segments at Pk, which is wrong.\n\nI recall that in snake, when you eat, the tail doesn't move, so the new segment is added at the tail position, but the tail position is the same, so for the next move, the tail will stay or move.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think that after eating, the snake length increases, so when you move to the food, the head moves to food, the body follows, but the tail does not advance; it stays, so the new positions include the previous tail position and the new head position.\n\nFor example, from state before move: head P0, body P1 to P9, tail P9.\n\nMove head to F, so new head F, body segments: P0 becomes new body1, P1 becomes body2, ..., P8 becomes body9, P9 becomes body10, and since eating, a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, but the tail was at P9, and it moved to P8's position? I'm messing up.\n\nStandard snake mechanics: when the snake moves to a cell without food, the head moves to the new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail cell is vacated.\n\nWhen the snake moves to a cell with food, the head moves to the new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, but the tail does not vacate; instead, the tail stays, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so the snake grows.\n\nSo positions after eating: the new head is at the food cell, the first body segment is at the previous head position, the second body at the previous first body position, and so on, up to the previous tail position, and the new tail is at the previous tail position.\n\nFor example, previous positions: H, B1, B2, ..., B8, T\n\nMove to food at F.\n\nNew positions: H' = F, B1' = H, B2' = B1, B3' = B2, ..., B9' = B8, T' = T, and new segment added at T, so the tail is now at T, but it's the new tail segment.\n\nThe position list is [F, H, B1, B2, ..., B8, T] with T now the tail position.\n\nLength increased by one.\n\nIn the case of moving to (4,2) from (4,3):\n\nBefore move: positions at turn after move to (4,3): H(4,3), B1(4,4), B2(4,5), B3(5,5), B4(6,5), B5(6,4), B6(6,3), B7(6,2), B8(6,1), T(5,1)\n\nTail at (5,1)\n\nHead at (4,3), move down to (4,2), which is food.\n\nNew head at (4,2), then body: B1' = previous H = (4,3), B2' = previous B1 = (4,4), B3' = previous B2 = (4,5), B4' = previous B3 = (5,5), B5' = previous B4 = (6,5), B6' = previous B5 = (6,4), B7' = previous B6 = (6,3), B8' = previous B7 = (6,2), B9' = previous B8 = (6,1), T' = previous T = (5,1), and since eating, a new segment is added at previous T position (5,1), so the new tail is at (5,1).\n\nSo positions: H(4,2), B1(4,3), B2(4,4), B3(4,5), B4(5,5), B5(6,5), B6(6,4), B7(6,3), B8(6,2), B9(6,1), T(5,1)\n\nT is at (5,1), which is the same as before.\n\nNow, back to tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and the tail cell has food, eating it kills.\n\nHere, when I move to (4,2), the tail is at (5,1), which is not adjacent to (4,2). (4,2) and (5,1) are diagonal, not adjacent; adjacent means sharing a side, so up/down/left/right.\n\n(4,2) and (5,1) are not adjacent; (4,2) adjacent to (4,1), (4,3), (3,2), (5,2).\n\nTail at (5,1), which is not adjacent to (4,2).\n\nSo no problem.\n\nFood at (4,2) is on the cell, not under tail.\n\nTail reward danger is when the food is under the tail cell and head moves there while adjacent.\n\nBut here, food is at (4,2), tail is at (5,1), so not an issue.\n\nSimilarly, for (6,2), food is under body, not tail.\n\nSo for now, no immediate danger.\n\nLet's plan the moves.\n\nFirst, I need to maximize score, so I should eat food when possible, but avoid risks.\n\nFood at (5,4) can be eaten now, but as I saw, it might trap me.\n\nIf I eat at (5,4), then I must go to (5,3), then from there, I can go to (4,3) or (5,2).\n\nIf I go to (5,2), then I can eat the food at (4,2) if I go left, but (4,2) is not adjacent to (5,2); from (5,2), left to (4,2).\n\n(4,2) has food, so I can eat it.\n\nFrom (5,3), if I go down to (5,2), then from (5,2) I can go left to (4,2) to eat.\n\nOr from (5,3) go left to (4,3), then down to (4,2) to eat.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nAlso, there is the food at (6,2) under body.\n\nTo eat that, I need to vacate (6,2).\n\nCurrently, the segment at (6,2) is B6 in the initial list.\n\nAfter several moves without eating, it will become tail.\n\nFor example, if I make 3 moves without eating, that segment will be tail, then on the fourth move, if I move the tail away, (6,2) is free, and I can move head to it.\n\nBut head needs to be able to reach (6,2) at that time.\n\nSince life span is long, I can plan to eat it later.\n\nFirst, at turn 44, I should avoid eating if it risks trapping me.\n\nLet's list all possible paths.\n\nOption 1: Move right to (5,4) and eat food. Then I must go down to (5,3). From (5,3), I can go down to (5,2) or left to (4,3).\n\nIf go to (5,2), then from (5,2) I can go left to (4,2) to eat or down to (5,1) but (5,1) is occupied or will be? After eating at (5,4), positions include (5,1) as tail or body.\n\nAfter eating at (5,4), positions: H(5,4), B1(4,4), B2(4,5), B3(5,5), B4(6,5), B5(6,4), B6(6,3), B7(6,2), B8(6,1), B9(5,1), T(4,1) 11 segments.\n\nThen move down to (5,3): new H(5,3), B1(5,4), B2(4,4), etc., T moves to B9 position or something.\n\nAfter move to (5,3) without eating (since no food there), new positions: H(5,3), B1(5,4), B2(4,4), B3(4,5), B4(5,5), B5(6,5), B6(6,4), B7(6,3), B8(6,2), B9(6,1), T(5,1)  and (4,1) vacated.\n\nTail at (5,1).\n\nFrom (5,3), move down to (5,2): new H(5,2), B1(5,3), B2(5,4), B3(4,4), B4(4,5), B5(5,5), B6(6,5), B7(6,4), B8(6,3), B9(6,2), T(6,1)  and (5,1) vacated.\n\nThen from (5,2), I can move left to (4,2) which has food, so eat it.\n\nNew head at (4,2), then body: B1' = (5,2), B2' = (5,3), B3' = (5,4), B4' = (4,4), B5' = (4,5), B6' = (5,5), B7' = (6,5), B8' = (6,4), B9' = (6,3), B10' = (6,2), T' = (6,1), and new tail at (6,1), so positions: H(4,2), B1(5,2), B2(5,3), B3(5,4), B4(4,4), B5(4,5), B6(5,5), B7(6,5), B8(6,4), B9(6,3), B10(6,2), T(6,1)\n\nHead at (4,2), direction left (since moved left from (5,2)).\n\nThen from (4,2), can move down to (4,1), left to (3,2), or right to (5,2) but (5,2) is body, collision, or up to (4,3) but (4,3) not in positions, but in the list, B1 is (5,2), so (4,3) is free? Positions have (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), etc., no (4,3), so (4,3) free.\n\nAdjacent cells to (4,2): down (4,1) free, left (3,2) free, right (5,2) occupied, up (4,3) free.\n\nSo can move down, left, or up.\n\nBut direction is left, so no reverse, cannot move right, but right is occupied anyway.\n\nPossible moves: down to (4,1), left to (3,2), or up to (4,3).\n\n(4,1) is free, can go there.\n\nBut this path has eaten two foods, but the snake is longer, and the area is getting crowded.\n\nAlso, the food at (6,2) is still under body, at B10 position.\n\nTo eat it, need to vacate.\n\nBut let's see other options.\n\nOption 2: at turn 44, move down to (4,3) without eating. Then from there, I can move to (4,2) to eat or elsewhere.\n\nMove down to (4,3): positions as before.\n\nThen from (4,3), move down to (4,2) to eat food.\n\nAs I had earlier.\n\nThen positions: H(4,2), B1(4,3), B2(4,4), B3(4,5), B4(5,5), B5(6,5), B6(6,4), B7(6,3), B8(6,2), B9(6,1), T(5,1)\n\nHead at (4,2), direction down.\n\nThen can move down to (4,1), left to (3,2), or right to (5,2).\n\n(5,2) is free, not occupied.\n\nSo all three possible.\n\nI can go to (5,2), for example.\n\nThen from (5,2), can go to other places.\n\nBut food at (5,4) is still there, life span 4, so I can eat it later if possible.\n\nLife span decreases each turn, including current.\n\nOn turn 44, food at (5,4) has life span 4, so after turn 44, it becomes 3, etc.\n\nIf I don't eat it on turn 44, on turn 45 it has life span 3, still available.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAnother option: move left to (3,4) at turn 44.\n\nThen head at (3,4), direction left.\n\nPositions: H(3,4), B1(4,4), B2(4,5), B3(5,5), B4(6,5), B5(6,4), B6(6,3), B7(6,2), B8(6,1), T(5,1)  (4,1) vacated.\n\nFrom (3,4), can move down to (3,3), left to (2,4), or up to (3,5).\n\nAll free.\n\nThen I can explore, but the foods are on the right, so I might miss the food at (5,4) if I go left.\n\nLife span of (5,4) is short, only 4 turns, so if I don't eat it soon, it disappears.\n\nTurn 44: life span 4, available on 44,45,46,47.\n\nIf I move left, I might not be able to eat it in time.\n\nFor example, from (3,4), to reach (5,4), I need to move right, but direction is left, so from (3,4), moving right to (4,4) is reverse, not allowed, so I can only move down, left, or up.\n\nTo get to (5,4), I need to go around, like down to (3,3), then right to (4,3), then up to (4,4) or something, but (4,4) is body.\n\nFrom (3,4), move down to (3,3), then from (3,3) can move right to (4,3), then from (4,3) can move right to (5,3), then up to (5,4).\n\nBut at (5,4), if it's turn 47 or later, food might be gone.\n\nTurn 44: move to (3,4)\n\nTurn 45: from (3,4) move down to (3,3)\n\nTurn 46: from (3,3) move right to (4,3)\n\nTurn 47: from (4,3) move right to (5,3)\n\nTurn 48: from (5,3) move up to (5,4)\n\nBut on turn 48, food at (5,4) has life span: on turn 44:4, 45:3, 46:2, 47:1, 48:0 gone. So on turn 48, it disappears, cannot eat. On turn 47, life span 1, can be eaten.\n\nOn turn 47, at (4,3), move right to (5,3), but (5,4) is above, not directly.\n\nTo eat on turn 47, head must be at (5,4) on turn 47.\n\nFrom (4,3) on turn 47, I can move to (5,3), but not to (5,4) directly; from (4,3), possible moves are to (4,2), (4,4), (3,3), (5,3), but (4,4) is body, so to (4,2), (3,3), or (5,3).\n\nCannot go directly to (5,4) from (4,3); need to go to (5,3) first, then to (5,4) on next turn.\n\nBut on turn 47, if I move to (5,3), food at (5,4) has life span 1, then on turn 48 it disappears, so I can eat it on turn 47 only if I am at (5,4) on turn 47.\n\nBut from (4,3) on turn 47, I cannot reach (5,4) in one move; I can only move to adjacent cells, so to (5,4) is not adjacent from (4,3); adjacent are (4,2), (4,4), (3,3), (5,3).\n\n(4,4) is body, so not possible to move to (5,4) from (4,3) directly.\n\nSo the only way to eat (5,4) is on turn 44 or 45 or 46 or 47, but from the left side, it's hard to reach in time.\n\nFor example, on turn 44 at (4,4), I can move right to (5,4) on turn 44.\n\nOr on turn 45, if I am at (4,4) or (5,3) or (4,3), etc., but after moving down or left, it might not be possible soon.\n\nSo to not miss the food, I should eat it on turn 44 or have a plan to eat it soon.\n\nBut eating it on turn 44 might force me into a tight spot.\n\nAt turn 44, move down to (4,3), then on turn 45, from (4,3) I can move right to (5,3), then on turn 46 from (5,3) move up to (5,4) to eat, but on turn 46, food life span: turn 44:4, 45:3, 46:2, so on turn 46 it can be eaten.\n\nFrom (4,3) on turn 45, move right to (5,3), then turn 46 from (5,3) move up to (5,4) to eat.\n\nBut from (5,3) to (5,4) is up, and previous direction from (4,3) to (5,3) is right, so moving up is not reverse, so allowed.\n\nThen I can eat on turn 46.\n\nSimilarly, if I move left at turn 44, I might not reach in time.\n\nSo for maximizing score, I should eat the food at (5,4) either now or soon.\n\nBut let's consider the risk.\n\nIf I eat at (5,4) on turn 44, then I must go to (5,3), and from there, I can go to (5,2) or (4,3).\n\nIf I go to (5,2), then I can eat at (4,2) on next turn.\n\nBut after eating at (5,4), the snake is longer, and in the bottom-left area, it might be ok.\n\nThe food at (6,2) can be targeted later.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, let's outline a plan.\n\nPlan A: Eat (5,4) on turn 44.\n\nTurn 44: move R to (5,4), eat, grow.\n\nNew positions: H(5,4), B1(4,4), B2(4,5), B3(5,5), B4(6,5), B5(6,4), B6(6,3), B7(6,2), B8(6,1), B9(5,1), T(4,1)\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen only possible move: D to (5,3)\n\nTurn 45: move D to (5,3), no food, so just move.\n\nNew positions: H(5,3), B1(5,4), B2(4,4), B3(4,5), B4(5,5), B5(6,5), B6(6,4), B7(6,3), B8(6,2), B9(6,1), T(5,1)  (4,1) vacated.\n\nDirection D.\n\nFrom (5,3), can move D to (5,2), L to (4,3), or R to (6,3) but (6,3) occupied, so only D or L.\n\nSay move D to (5,2)\n\nTurn 46: move D to (5,2), no food there, so move.\n\nNew positions: H(5,2), B1(5,3), B2(5,4), B3(4,4), B4(4,5), B5(5,5), B6(6,5), B7(6,4), B8(6,3), B9(6,2), T(6,1)  (5,1) vacated.\n\nDirection D.\n\nFrom (5,2), can move D to (5,1) but (5,1) is wall? y=0 is wall, (5,1) is y=1, not wall, but in positions, T is at (6,1), so (5,1) is free? Not occupied, so can move down to (5,1)? (5,1) is free, yes.\n\n(5,1) is not in positions, so free.\n\nCan move L to (4,2), which has food, or D to (5,1), or R to (6,2) but (6,2) occupied.\n\n(6,2) is occupied by B9.\n\nSo possible: L to (4,2) or D to (5,1).\n\nMove L to (4,2) to eat food.\n\nTurn 47: move L to (4,2), eat food.\n\nNew head at (4,2), body: B1' = (5,2), B2' = (5,3), B3' = (5,4), B4' = (4,4), B5' = (4,5), B6' = (5,5), B7' = (6,5), B8' = (6,4), B9' = (6,3), B10' = (6,2), T' = (6,1), and new tail at (6,1), so positions: H(4,2), B1(5,2), B2(5,3), B3(5,4), B4(4,4), B5(4,5), B6(5,5), B7(6,5), B8(6,4), B9(6,3), B10(6,2), T(6,1)\n\nDirection L.\n\nFrom (4,2), can move U to (4,3), D to (4,1), L to (3,2), or R to (5,2) but (5,2) occupied, so U, D, or L.\n\n(4,3) free, (4,1) free, (3,2) free.\n\nSo I can move, say, U to (4,3) to open space.\n\nBut the snake is long, and the bottom row has walls, so might be tight.\n\nFood at (6,2) is at B10, still under body.\n\nTo eat it, need to vacate later.\n\nPlan B: At turn 44, move down to (4,3) without eating.\n\nTurn 44: move D to (4,3), no food.\n\nPositions: H(4,3), B1(4,4), B2(4,5), B3(5,5), B4(6,5), B5(6,4), B6(6,3), B7(6,2), B8(6,1), T(5,1)  (4,1) vacated.\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen turn 45: from (4,3), move R to (5,3) to position for eating (5,4).\n\n(5,3) no food, so move.\n\nNew positions: H(5,3), B1(4,3), B2(4,4), B3(4,5), B4(5,5), B5(6,5), B6(6,4), B7(6,3), B8(6,2), T(6,1)  (5,1) vacated.\n\nDirection R.\n\nFrom (5,3), can move U to (5,4) to eat food.\n\nTurn 46: move U to (5,4), eat food.\n\nNew head at (5,4), body: B1' = (5,3), B2' = (4,3), B3' = (4,4), B4' = (4,5), B5' = (5,5), B6' = (6,5), B7' = (6,4), B8' = (6,3), B9' = (6,2), T' = (6,1), and new tail at (6,1), so positions: H(5,4), B1(5,3), B2(4,3), B3(4,4), B4(4,5), B5(5,5), B6(6,5), B7(6,4), B8(6,3), B9(6,2), T(6,1)\n\nDirection U.\n\nFrom (5,4), can move U to (5,5) but (5,5) occupied, D to (5,3) but (5,3) occupied, L to (4,4) occupied, R to (6,4) occupied. All adjacent cells occupied? U (5,5) B5, D (5,3) B1, L (4,4) B3, R (6,4) B7, all occupied, so no possible move! Snake is trapped and will die on next turn.\n\nOh no! So if I eat at (5,4) on turn 46 after this path, I am trapped because the body surrounds the head.\n\nIn this position after moving to (5,4), head is at (5,4), and all around are body: up (5,5), down (5,3), left (4,4), right (6,4) all occupied.\n\nSo collision on any move, death.\n\nTherefore, this path is bad; I should not eat at (5,4) after moving to (5,3) from left or below.\n\nThe only safe way to eat (5,4) is on turn 44 directly from (4,4), because after eating, I can go down to (5,3), which is free.\n\nIf I delay, it might be risky.\n\nIn the first plan, when I ate at (5,4) on turn 44, I could go to (5,3), then to (5,2), etc., and it was ok.\n\nSo for (5,4), eating on turn 44 is safer.\n\nOtherwise, it might not be possible later.\n\nSo I should eat it now.\n\nThen for the other food.\n\nFood at (4,2) can be eaten later, life span 6.\n\nFood at (6,2) under body, life span 9.\n\nAfter eating at (5,4), I go to (5,3), then I can go to (4,3) instead of (5,2) to avoid the crowded bottom.\n\nTurn 44: move R to (5,4) eat.\n\nTurn 45: move D to (5,3)\n\nFrom (5,3), instead of down, move L to (4,3)\n\nTurn 46: move L to (4,3), no food.\n\nNew positions: H(4,3), B1(5,3), B2(5,4), B3(4,4), B4(4,5), B5(5,5), B6(6,5), B7(6,4), B8(6,3), B9(6,2), T(6,1)  (5,1) vacated, etc. but after eating at (5,4), positions have 11 segments, so when moving to (5,3), then to (4,3):\n\nAfter turn 45: at (5,3), positions H(5,3), B1(5,4), B2(4,4), B3(4,5), B4(5,5), B5(6,5), B6(6,4), B7(6,3), B8(6,2), B9(6,1), T(5,1)\n\nThen turn 46: move L to (4,3), no food, so new positions: H(4,3), B1(5,3), B2(5,4), B3(4,4), B4(4,5), B5(5,5), B6(6,5), B7(6,4), B8(6,3), B9(6,2), T(6,1)  (5,1) vacated.\n\nDirection L.\n\nFrom (4,3), can move U to (4,4) but occupied, D to (4,2), L to (3,3), or R to (5,3) occupied.\n\nSo possible: D to (4,2) or L to (3,3).\n\n(4,2) has food, so I can move D to (4,2) to eat.\n\nTurn 47: move D to (4,2), eat.\n\nNew head at (4,2), body: B1' = (4,3), B2' = (5,3), B3' = (5,4), B4' = (4,4), B5' = (4,5), B6' = (5,5), B7' = (6,5), B8' = (6,4), B9' = (6,3), B10' = (6,2), T' = (6,1), new tail at (6,1).\n\nPositions: H(4,2), B1(4,3), B2(5,3), B3(5,4), B4(4,4), B5(4,5), B6(5,5), B7(6,5), B8(6,4), B9(6,3), B10(6,2), T(6,1)\n\nDirection D.\n\nFrom (4,2), can move D to (4,1), L to (3,2), U to (4,3) occupied, R to (5,2) free? (5,2) not occupied, so can move D, L, or R to (5,2).\n\n(5,2) is free.\n\nThen I can move to (5,2) or other.\n\nThe snake is long, but there is space.\n\nFor the food at (6,2), it is at B10 position, still under body.\n\nTo eat it, I need to make it free.\n\nBut it will take many moves to vacate.\n\nSince the grid is small, and snake is long, I might risk collision if I stay in the area.\n\nBut there are other areas.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), so top is blocked.\n\nPerhaps I should not eat the food at (5,4) to keep the snake shorter for now, and go for the food at (4,2) or vacate (6,2).\n\nBut (5,4) has short life, so if I don't eat it, I lose the point.\n\nSince all food is +1, eating it is good.\n\nBut in the first plan, I can eat two foods quickly.\n\nThen for (6,2), I can plan to eat it later.\n\nFor example, after the above, the segment at (6,2) is B10, and tail at (6,1).\n\nAfter several moves without eating, it can be vacated.\n\nBut let's define the actions for the next few turns.\n\nSince the answer should be for turn t1 and a few ahead, but it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\" but the answer format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't specify how many, but probably for the immediate turns.\n\nBut I need to specify the sequence.\n\nPerhaps for turn 44, I should move right to eat the food.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, based on the state.\n\nBut the answer should include multiple turns.\n\nSince it's a response, I can list a few turns.\n\nBut to be safe, let's go with eating (5,4) on turn 44.\n\nThen move down to (5,3) on turn 45.\n\nThen on turn 46, move left to (4,3) to avoid the bottom crowding.\n\nThen on turn 47, move down to (4,2) to eat that food.\n\nThen from there, I can move left or down to explore.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nTurn 44: move R to (5,4)\n\nThen turn 45: move D to (5,3)\n\nTurn 46: move L to (4,3)\n\nTurn 47: move D to (4,2) and eat.\n\nBut on turn 47, when I move to (4,2), it is food, so eat.\n\nThen turn 48: from (4,2), I can move L to (3,2) or D to (4,1) or R to (5,2), etc.\n\nBut I don't need to specify all, but for the response, I can list up to turn 47 or so.\n\nSince the food at (6,2) is there, I can later go to it when free.\n\nBut for now, this sequence eats two foods and avoids immediate risk.\n\nIf I don't eat (5,4), I might miss it, and the other foods have longer life.\n\nBut in the trapped scenario, it's worse.\n\nSo I think moving right on turn 44 is the best.\n\nThen for the actions:\n\nTurn 44: R\n\nTurn 45: D\n\nTurn 46: L (to (4,3))\n\nBut on turn 46 at (4,3), I could move down to (4,2) immediately if I want, but in the sequence above, I moved left first to (4,3), then down to (4,2).\n\nFrom (5,3), I can move directly to (4,3) or to (5,2).\n\nMoving to (4,3) is safer for now.\n\nThen turn 47: D to (4,2)\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to list the actions.\n\nAlso, the head direction changes.\n\nBut in the answer format, it's the action for each turn.\n\nSo for turn 44: action R\n\nTurn 45: action D\n\nTurn 46: action L\n\nTurn 47: action D\n\nBut turn 47 is eating (4,2), which is good.\n\nThen beyond, I can stop here or add one more.\n\nSince thinking ahead, but for response, this should be fine.\n\nTo vacate (6,2), I need to not eat for a while, but since I just ate, it's ok.\n\nI think this is acceptable.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and simulated multiple move sequences 5+ turns ahead. The key considerations are:\n- Eating the food at (5,4) on turn 44 is time-sensitive (life span 4, expires after turn 47) and avoids missing the +1 reward. Delaying risks expiration or trapping.\n- After eating (5,4), moving down to (5,3) is forced to avoid collisions. Then, moving left to (4,3) opens space to access (4,2) safely.\n- Eating (4,2) on turn 47 is optimal (life span 6, ample time) and avoids the crowded bottom-left area.\n- The food at (6,2) under the body has a long life span (9), so it can be targeted later by vacating the cell through 3-4 moves without eating.\n- All moves avoid walls, body collisions, and instant reversals. The sequence below eats two foods, scores +2, and maintains maneuverability for future turns.\n\n**Move Sequence (5 turns planned):**\n- Turn 44: R (right) to (5,4) – Eat positive food (+1, length increases to 11).\n- Turn 45: D (down) to (5,3) – Necessary move; no food, no growth.\n- Turn 46: L (left) to (4,3) – Positions for eating (4,2); no food, no growth.\n- Turn 47: D (down) to (4,2) – Eat positive food (+1, length increases to 12).\n- Turn 48: L (left) to (3,2) – Explore left area; avoids potential dead ends and keeps (6,2) accessible later.\n\n**Reasoning for Long-Term Survival (5+ Turns):**\n- **Turn 44 (R to (5,4)):** Eating (5,4) now secures the reward before expiration. Moving right is safe and the only immediate food access. Delaying risks missing it or causing traps (e.g., if eaten later from (5,3), all adjacent cells may be occupied).\n- **Turn 45 (D to (5,3)):** Only valid move after eating (5,4); no collisions. Prepares to access open areas.\n- **Turn 46 (L to (4,3)):** Avoids moving down to (5,2), which could corner the snake near walls. Instead, moving left to (4,3) provides access to (4,2) and the left side of the grid, which is less crowded.\n- **Turn 47 (D to (4,2)):** Eating (4,2) here is safe—tail is at (6,1), not adjacent, so no tail reward danger. Life span allows this timing.\n- **Turn 48 (L to (3,2)):** Continues left to open space, reducing collision risk. From here, the snake can:\n  - Vacate (6,2) by making 3-4 moves without eating (e.g., moving left/down to shift the body; (6,2) becomes free after the tail moves away).\n  - Target (6,2) for eating once vacated (life span 9 allows ~5 turns to set this up).\n  - Avoid the internal obstacle (4,6) and walls by staying in x=1-6, y=1-5.\n- **Risk Mitigation:** This sequence avoids:\n  - Trapping: Eating (5,4) later (e.g., on turn 46) can cause surrounding collisions.\n  - Tail Reward Danger: At no point is the head adjacent to the tail with food on the tail cell.\n  - Food Loss: (5,4) is eaten with 2 turns to spare (life span 4 on turn 44, eaten immediately).\n  - Body Collisions: All moves are to free cells; head never touches body.\n- **Score Maximization:** Eats two +1 foods by turn 47. (6,2) can be eaten later for +1 after vacating, adding to the score.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 44: R (right)  \nTurn 45: D (down)  \nTurn 46: L (left)  \nTurn 47: D (down)  \nTurn 48: L (left)\n}",

The snake positions are: head at (5,4), then body segments at (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1). So the snake is 11 segments long. The head direction is right, meaning it was moving right to get to (5,4).\n\nFood items:\n\n- At (4,2) with value 1 and life span 5. So it disappears after 5 turns, including this one, so it will be gone by turn 50.\n\n- At (6,2) with value 1 and life span 8, so it disappears after turn 53.\n\nBoth are positive food since value is +1.\n\nI need to plan moves for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns. The answer should show actions for turn 45, 46, 47, etc., up to at least turn 49 or beyond.\n\nKey constraints:\n\n- Can't move opposite to current direction immediately. Current direction is R (right), so I can't move left on the next turn.\n\n- Must avoid collisions: with walls, obstacles, or body segments except the tail under certain conditions.\n\n- Tail collision rule: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because the new tail grows and collides.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid. It's 8x8? x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so yes, 8x8 grid.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. Internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (5,4)\n\nBody: (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)\n\nSo let's list all occupied cells:\n\n- (5,4) head\n\n- (4,4) body\n\n- (4,5) body\n\n- (5,5) body\n\n- (6,5) body\n\n- (6,4) body\n\n- (6,3) body\n\n- (6,2) body\n\n- (6,1) body\n\n- (5,1) body\n\n- (4,1) body\n\nTail is at (4,1).\n\nFood at (4,2) and (6,2).\n\n(6,2) has food, but (6,2) is also a body segment? Snake positions include (6,2) as the 8th segment? Let's index:\n\nPositions: index 0: head (5,4)\n\n1: (4,4)\n\n2: (4,5)\n\n3: (5,5)\n\n4: (6,5)\n\n5: (6,4)\n\n6: (6,3)\n\n7: (6,2)\n\n8: (6,1)\n\n9: (5,1)\n\n10: (4,1) tail\n\nSo (6,2) is position 7, which is a body segment, and food is at (6,2) with value 1. But according to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nSimilarly, food at (4,2) is not occupied by snake currently.\n\n(4,2) is not in snake positions, so it's free.\n\n(6,2) is occupied by body segment 7.\n\nFood at (4,2) and (6,2) both exist, but (6,2) is under the body.\n\nNow, head is at (5,4), moving right.\n\nCurrent possible moves from (5,4):\n\n- Up: (5,5) but (5,5) is occupied by body segment 3? Positions: (5,5) is index 3, which is body. So moving up to (5,5) would be collision with body.\n\n- Down: (5,3) – is this free? Let's see what cells are occupied.\n\nOccupied cells: all snake positions: (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)\n\nAlso walls: borders and (4,6) obstacle.\n\n(5,3): not in the list, so it should be free, unless wall. Walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (4,6). (5,3) is within bounds, no wall, so free.\n\n- Left: (4,4) – but (4,4) is body segment 1, occupied, collision.\n\n- Right: (6,4) – (6,4) is body segment 5, occupied, collision.\n\nFrom (5,4), moving:\n\n- U to (5,5): occupied by body\n\n- D to (5,3): free\n\n- L to (4,4): occupied by body\n\n- R to (6,4): occupied by body\n\nSo only possible move is down to (5,3). Is that right?\n\n(5,5) is occupied, (4,4) occupied, (6,4) occupied, (5,3) not occupied.\n\nBut (6,4) is segment 5, yes occupied.\n\nBut in snake movement, when the snake moves, the tail moves, so after moving, some cells might be free.\n\nFor collision, when deciding to move to a cell, if that cell is occupied by any body segment except the tail, it's a collision. But the tail might move.\n\nStandard snake rules: if head moves to a cell that is occupied by a body segment other than the tail, it's collision. But if it moves to the tail's current position, it's ok because tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, from (5,4), possible moves:\n\n- U: (5,5) – which is occupied by segment 3, not tail, so collision if I move there.\n\n- D: (5,3) – not occupied, should be safe.\n\n- L: (4,4) – occupied by segment 1, collision.\n\n- R: (6,4) – occupied by segment 5, collision.\n\nSegment 5 is (6,4), which is not tail; tail is (4,1).\n\nSo indeed, only down to (5,3) is possible without immediate collision.\n\nBut is (5,3) within bounds? x=5, y=3, between 0 and 7, not wall, so yes.\n\nAlso, can't move left because that would be opposite to current direction? Current direction is R (right), so moving left would be opposite, which is not allowed on the next turn.\n\nCurrent head direction is R, meaning it came from left, so moving left would be back, opposite direction.\n\nSo for turn 45, from (5,4), I cannot move left because it's opposite to current direction R.\n\nBut in the possible moves, left is not possible anyway because occupied.\n\nBut down is possible and not opposite; opposite would be left only, since right is current, up and down are perpendicular.\n\nDirections: U, D, L, R.\n\nCurrent direction R, so opposite is L, so cannot move L on next turn.\n\nU and D are allowed.\n\nSo from (5,4), only D is possible: to (5,3).\n\nIs that correct? What about moving to other cells? No, only adjacent cells.\n\n(5,3) is the only free adjacent cell.\n\nUnless I consider that some cells might be freed, but for immediate move, I have to see current occupancy.\n\nAfter moving, the snake will move, tail moves, so cells change.\n\nBut for the move decision, at turn 45, when I move the head to a cell, it must not be occupied by any body part except possibly the tail, but in this case, tail is far away.\n\nSpecifically, (6,4) is occupied, but if I move right, it would be to (6,4), which is a body segment, and since it's not the tail, it would collide immediately.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo yes, only down to (5,3) is possible.\n\nThen, after moving down, the new head position is (5,3), and the tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed.\n\nSnake positions after move: head moves to (5,3), then the body segments follow: the previous head (5,4) becomes neck, then (4,4), (4,5), etc., but since we move, the tail (4,1) is removed.\n\nNew positions: head at (5,3), then the rest: position 0 was (5,4), now becomes body, so new positions: [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)] and tail (4,1) is gone.\n\nPositions: original: indices 0: (5,4), 1: (4,4), 2: (4,5), 3: (5,5), 4: (6,5), 5: (6,4), 6: (6,3), 7: (6,2), 8: (6,1), 9: (5,1), 10: (4,1)\n\nAfter moving down to (5,3), new head is (5,3), then body: previous head (5,4) now index 1, then index 1 (4,4) now index 2, index 2 (4,5) index 3, index 3 (5,5) index 4, index 4 (6,5) index 5, index 5 (6,4) index 6, index 6 (6,3) index 7, index 7 (6,2) index 8, index 8 (6,1) index 9, index 9 (5,1) index 10, and index 10 (4,1) is removed, so tail is now (5,1).\n\nNew positions: head (5,3), then (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)\n\nSo tail at (5,1).\n\nNow, food at (4,2) and (6,2). (6,2) is now index 8 in new positions, which is body segment.\n\n(4,2) is not occupied.\n\nLife span: food at (4,2) has life span 5, so on turn 45, it has 5 turns left, meaning after 5 turns it disappears, so from turn 45 to 49 it exists, gone on turn 50.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) has life span 8, from turn 45 to 52, gone on 53.\n\nNow, for turn 45, I must move down to (5,3), as that's the only choice.\n\nThen, on turn 46, head is at (5,3), direction is now D (down), since I moved down.\n\nFrom (5,3), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (5,4) – but (5,4) is now the neck, body segment just behind head, occupied, so collision.\n\n- D: to (5,2) – is it free? Not in snake positions: head (5,3), body (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)\n\n(5,2) not in list, so free.\n\n- L: to (4,3) – not in list, should be free.\n\n- R: to (6,3) – (6,3) is body segment index 7? New positions: index 0: head (5,3), index1: (5,4), index2: (4,4), index3: (4,5), index4: (5,5), index5: (6,5), index6: (6,4), index7: (6,3), index8: (6,2), index9: (6,1), index10: (5,1)\n\nSo (6,3) is index 7, body segment, occupied.\n\n(5,2), (4,3), (6,3) but (6,3) occupied.\n\nAlso, cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is D (down), so opposite is U, which is not possible anyway.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (5,2), L to (4,3), R to (6,3) but (6,3) occupied, so only D and L.\n\n(6,3) is occupied, so not possible.\n\nU is also occupied and opposite not applicable.\n\nSo from (5,3), can move to (5,2) down or (4,3) left.\n\nNow, I need to think about getting food.\n\nFood at (4,2) is close. (4,2) is below and left of current head (5,3)? (5,3) to (4,2) is not adjacent directly; it's diagonal. Moves must be adjacent cells: up, down, left, right.\n\nFrom (5,3), (4,2) is down-left, not directly adjacent, so I need to move to adjacent cells.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) is down-right from (5,3), but (6,2) is occupied by body.\n\n(6,2) is index 8, body segment.\n\nBut food is there, so if the body moves away, I can eat it later.\n\nFor turn 46, from (5,3), I can go down to (5,2) or left to (4,3).\n\nIf I go down to (5,2), then I can then go left to (4,2) to eat the food, since (4,2) has food.\n\n(4,2) is not occupied now, so I can move to it directly if adjacent.\n\nFrom (5,2), (4,2) is left, adjacent.\n\nSimilarly, from (4,3), (4,2) is down.\n\nAlso, need to consider the tail food danger.\n\nBut for now, let's plan.\n\nFirst, I should eat the food at (4,2) soon because it has shorter life span, only 5 turns, so by turn 49 it must be eaten or lost.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) has longer life.\n\nBut (6,2) is under body, so I need to move the body away first.\n\nNow, for turn 46, if I move down to (5,2), then on turn 47, from (5,2), I can move left to (4,2) to eat the food.\n\n(4,2) has food, value +1, so eating it increases length.\n\nBut let's simulate.\n\nFirst, turn 45: must move down to (5,3). Action: D\n\nTurn 46: from (5,3), I can choose D or L.\n\nIf I go D to (5,2), then on turn 47, from (5,2), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (5,3) – but (5,3) is previous head, now body? After turn 46 move to (5,2), let's track positions.\n\nAfter turn 45: positions as above, head (5,3), body (5,4), etc.\n\nTurn 46: if move down to (5,2), new head (5,2), then body: previous head (5,3) now body, then (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1) and tail (5,1) is removed? Positions: after move, head to (5,2), then the body follows: the segment that was at (5,3) is now behind head, so new positions: [(5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)] and (5,1) is gone, so tail at (6,1).\n\nNow, from (5,2), possible moves turn 47:\n\n- U to (5,3): (5,3) is now body segment index 1? New positions: index0: head (5,2), index1: (5,3), index2: (5,4), index3: (4,4), index4: (4,5), index5: (5,5), index6: (6,5), index7: (6,4), index8: (6,3), index9: (6,2), index10: (6,1)\n\n(5,3) is index1, body, so moving up to (5,3) would collide.\n\n- D to (5,1): but (5,1) is not in the list? (5,1) was tail before, but now it's gone. Current positions: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1). (5,1) is not occupied, so (5,1) is free? (5,1) was index10 before, but after move to (5,2), it was removed.\n\ny=1, x=5: (5,1) was occupied but now tail moved, so (5,1) is free unless wall. No wall, so free.\n\n- L to (4,2): (4,2) is not in positions, and has food, so I can move there to eat it.\n\n- R to (6,2): (6,2) is index9, body segment, occupied.\n\nAlso, current direction: after moving down to (5,2), direction is D, so opposite U not allowed, but U not possible anyway.\n\nSo from (5,2), can move D to (5,1) or L to (4,2).\n\n(4,2) has food, so moving L to (4,2) would eat the food.\n\nWhen I eat food, the snake grows, so tail doesn't move that turn.\n\nSo if on turn 47 I move to (4,2) and eat food, the length increases.\n\nNow, back to turn 46 choice.\n\nIf on turn 46 I move left to (4,3) instead of down.\n\nTurn 46: from (5,3), move L to (4,3).\n\nThen new head at (4,3), body: previous head (5,3) now body, then (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1) and tail (5,1) removed? Positions: head (4,3), then (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) tail at (6,1).\n\n(5,1) is gone.\n\nFrom (4,3), turn 47, possible moves:\n\n- U to (4,4): (4,4) is now body segment index 3? Positions: index0: head (4,3), index1: (5,3), index2: (5,4), index3: (4,4), index4: (4,5), index5: (5,5), index6: (6,5), index7: (6,4), index8: (6,3), index9: (6,2), index10: (6,1)\n\n(4,4) is index3, body, so moving up collides.\n\n- D to (4,2): (4,2) is free and has food, so can move there to eat.\n\n- L to (3,3): not occupied, free.\n\n- R to (5,3): (5,3) is index1, body, occupied.\n\nCurrent direction: after moving left, direction is L, so opposite R not allowed, but R not possible anyway.\n\nSo can move D to (4,2) or L to (3,3).\n\nIf move D to (4,2), eat food immediately on turn 47.\n\nIf on turn 46 I moved down to (5,2), I can eat on turn 47 by moving left.\n\nIn both cases, I can reach (4,2) by turn 47.\n\nBut if I go directly left on turn 46 to (4,3), then down to (4,2) on turn 47.\n\nOr down to (5,2) on 46, then left to (4,2) on 47.\n\nNow, which is better? I need to think about the path and future moves.\n\nAlso, there is food at (6,2) which is under body. Currently, (6,2) is occupied, but if the snake moves, it might free up.\n\nMoreover, tail is at (6,1) or (5,1), depending on moves.\n\nBut (6,2) has food, and if I can get the head there after the body moves away.\n\nNow, life span of (4,2) is short, only 5 turns from turn 45, so I must eat it by turn 49.\n\nSimilarly for (6,2), by turn 52.\n\nBut since (4,2) is easier, I should eat it soon.\n\nNow, after eating (4,2), the snake grows, so it gets longer.\n\nI also need to avoid dead ends.\n\nCurrent grid: let's sketch the grid mentally.\n\nGrid 8x8, walls at borders.\n\nObstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions after turn 45 move down: head (5,3), body (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)\n\nSo the snake is coiled around.\n\nFood at (4,2) and (6,2), but (6,2) occupied.\n\nFree cells: for example, (5,2) is free, (4,3) is free, (3,3), (3,4), etc.\n\n(4,2) is free.\n\nAfter eating (4,2), the snake will have 12 segments.\n\nNow, for (6,2) food, it is currently occupied by body, but as the snake moves, that segment will move.\n\nFor example, if I move in a way that the segment at (6,2) moves away, then (6,2) becomes free, and I can move head to it to eat.\n\nBut (6,2) has food, so if head moves to it when free, it eats.\n\nBut there is a danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills.\n\nBut here, tail is not at (6,2), tail is at (5,1) or moving.\n\nIn current state after turn 45, tail is at (5,1).\n\n(6,2) is not tail.\n\nBut when I move, tail changes.\n\nTo eat (6,2), I need to have head move to (6,2) when it is not occupied.\n\nCurrently occupied, so I need to move the snake so that the body leaves (6,2).\n\nFor example, if I move down to (5,2) on turn 46, then positions: head (5,2), body (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) tail.\n\n(6,2) is still occupied by index9.\n\nThen if I move left to (4,2) on turn 47, eat food, snake grows to 12 segments, so new tail doesn't move, positions: head at (4,2), then body: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) and since ate food, add new segment, so tail is still (6,1), but the segment added, so positions: head (4,2), then (5,2), (5,3), ..., up to (6,1), and new tail at (6,1) or? When eating, the tail doesn't move, so the new position is added at the head, so the tail remains where it was.\n\nAfter moving to food, head moves to (4,2), which was empty, but now occupied, and since food, the body doesn't remove the tail, so the snake grows: positions become [(4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)] so 12 segments, tail at (6,1).\n\n(6,2) is still occupied by body, index 10? Positions: 0: (4,2), 1: (5,2), 2: (5,3), 3: (5,4), 4: (4,4), 5: (4,5), 6: (5,5), 7: (6,5), 8: (6,4), 9: (6,3), 10: (6,2), 11: (6,1)\n\n(6,2) is index 10, body segment, and food is there, but it's under body, so not eatable yet.\n\nTo eat it, I need to move the body away so that (6,2) becomes free, then move head to it.\n\nBut currently occupied.\n\nSimilarly, if I had moved differently.\n\nBack to turn 46 choice.\n\nI need to plan multiple turns.\n\nAlso, there might be risks.\n\nFor example, if I go to (4,2) quickly, I might get trapped.\n\nLet's list possible paths.\n\nFirst, for turn 45, only choice is D to (5,3).\n\nThen turn 46, from (5,3), I can go D to (5,2) or L to (4,3).\n\nOption 1: turn 46 D to (5,2)\n\nThen turn 47 from (5,2): can go L to (4,2) to eat food, or D to (5,1)\n\nBut (5,1) is free, but no food, so better to eat (4,2).\n\nSo turn 47 L to (4,2), eat food, snake grows to 12.\n\nNow positions: head (4,2), body as above: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)\n\nDirection after moving left, so head direction L.\n\nNow turn 48, from (4,2), possible moves:\n\n- U to (4,3): is it free? Current positions: (4,2) head, (5,2), (5,3), etc. (4,3) not occupied, free.\n\n- D to (4,1): (4,1) is not in positions, free? But walls? y=1, x=4, within bounds, no wall, free.\n\n- L to (3,2): free, not occupied.\n\n- R to (5,2): (5,2) is body segment index 1, occupied.\n\nAlso, current direction L, so opposite R not allowed.\n\nSo can move U to (4,3), D to (4,1), or L to (3,2).\n\n(4,3) is free, yes.\n\nIf I move U to (4,3), then positions: head to (4,3), body: (4,2) becomes neck, then (5,2), (5,3), etc., tail (6,1) removed? After move, if no food, tail moves.\n\nTurn 48, moving from (4,2) to say (4,3), no food there, so tail moves.\n\nNew positions: head (4,3), then body (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2) and tail (6,1) removed, so tail at (6,2)? Positions: after move, head (4,3), then previous head (4,2) now body, then (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), and (6,1) gone, so 11 segments again? Since we ate food, snake is longer, but when we move without eating, tail moves.\n\nAfter eating on turn 47, snake has 12 segments.\n\nTurn 48, moving to (4,3), which has no food, so head moves to (4,3), and tail is removed, so snake back to 11 segments? No.\n\nWhen snake eats, it grows, so length increases permanently until next eat or negative food.\n\nAfter eating on turn 47, length is 12.\n\nWhen moving on turn 48 to a cell with no food, head moves to new position, the body follows, and the tail is removed, so length remains 12, but the last segment is removed.\n\nStandard: when not eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position, tail cell is vacated.\n\nWhen eating, head moves to food cell, new segment is added at head, so tail doesn't move, length increases.\n\nThen on next move, if not eating, head moves, body follows, tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, after turn 47 eat, positions: 12 segments as above.\n\nTurn 48, move to (4,3), no food, so head moves to (4,3), then the segment that was at (4,2) moves to where head was, but since body follows, the first body segment moves to the previous head position, which is (4,2), but it was already there? Let's think.\n\nPrevious positions: head at (4,2), body segments at (5,2), (5,3), ..., (6,1)\n\nWhen head moves to (4,3), the new head is (4,3), then the body segment that was immediately behind (which is (5,2)? No.\n\nThe body segments: index 0: head (4,2), index1: (5,2), index2: (5,3), index3: (5,4), index4: (4,4), index5: (4,5), index6: (5,5), index7: (6,5), index8: (6,4), index9: (6,3), index10: (6,2), index11: (6,1)\n\nWhen head moves to (4,3), the new position 0 is (4,3), then position 1 is the previous position 0, which is (4,2), position 2 is previous position 1, (5,2), position 3 is previous position 2, (5,3), and so on, up to position 11 is previous position 10, (6,2), and the last position, previous position 11 (6,1) is removed, so new tail is at (6,2).\n\nNew positions: head (4,3), then (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2) and (6,1) gone.\n\nSo 12 segments, tail at (6,2).\n\n(6,2) has food, and now tail is at (6,2), so the food is under the tail.\n\nBut to eat it, I need the head to move to (6,2) when it's free, but if tail moves away, it might be possible.\n\nBut there's a danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills.\n\nBut here, tail is at (6,2) with food.\n\nHead is at (4,3), not adjacent to (6,2).\n\nIf I move the snake, the tail will move when we don't eat food.\n\nFor example, on turn 48, after moving to (4,3), tail is at (6,2) with food.\n\nNow, from (4,3), I can move U, D, or L.\n\nSay I move U to (4,4): but (4,4) is body segment index 5? New positions: index4 is (4,4), which is body, so moving to (4,4) would collide.\n\nPositions: index0: (4,3), index1: (4,2), index2: (5,2), index3: (5,3), index4: (5,4), index5: (4,4), index6: (4,5), index7: (5,5), index8: (6,5), index9: (6,4), index10: (6,3), index11: (6,2)\n\n(4,4) is index5, body, so occupied.\n\nD to (4,1): free.\n\nL to (3,3): free.\n\nR to (5,3): (5,3) is index3, body, occupied.\n\nCurrent direction L (since moved left to (4,2) on turn 47), so opposite R not allowed.\n\nSo can move D to (4,1) or L to (3,3).\n\nSay I move L to (3,3).\n\nThen new head (3,3), body: (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3) and tail (6,2) removed, so new tail at (6,3).\n\n(6,2) is vacated, and since food is there, it is now free to be eaten, but head is at (3,3), far away.\n\nSo (6,2) food is now available.\n\nBut I need to get head there.\n\nFirst, let's go back to turn 46.\n\nI have another option for turn 46: from (5,3), move left to (4,3).\n\nThen turn 47, from (4,3), I can move down to (4,2) to eat food.\n\nTurn 47: move D to (4,2), eat, snake grows to 12.\n\nPositions: head (4,2), then body: (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) and since ate, no tail move, so tail at (6,1).\n\n(6,2) is index 10? Positions: 0: (4,2), 1: (4,3), 2: (5,3), 3: (5,4), 4: (4,4), 5: (4,5), 6: (5,5), 7: (6,5), 8: (6,4), 9: (6,3), 10: (6,2), 11: (6,1)\n\n(6,2) is index 10, body, with food under it.\n\nThen turn 48, from (4,2), can move U to (4,3) but (4,3) is body index 1, occupied; D to (4,1) free; L to (3,2) free; R to (5,2) free? (5,2) not occupied, free.\n\nCurrent direction D (since moved down to (4,2)), so opposite U not allowed.\n\nSo can move D to (4,1), L to (3,2), or R to (5,2).\n\nIf I move R to (5,2), for example.\n\nThen new head (5,2), body: (4,2) neck, then (4,3), (5,3), etc., tail (6,1) removed? After move, head to (5,2), no food, so tail moves: new positions head (5,2), then (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2) and (6,1) gone, so tail at (6,2).\n\nAgain, tail at (6,2) with food.\n\nSo in both paths, after eating (4,2), the tail ends up at (6,2) with food soon after.\n\nBut to eat (6,2), I need the head to be able to move there when it's free.\n\nBut when tail moves away, (6,2) becomes free.\n\nFor example, after tail is at (6,2) with food, on the next move, if I don't eat food, tail moves away, so (6,2) is vacated, and food is there, so it can be eaten if head moves to it.\n\nBut the head is far, at (4,3) or (5,2), etc.\n\nMoreover, there is the tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills.\n\nBut if head is not adjacent, it's ok.\n\nWhen tail is at (6,2) with food, and I move, tail moves away, so (6,2) is free, then head can move to it later.\n\nBut I need to coordinate.\n\nPerhaps I should not eat (4,2) immediately and first free up (6,2) or something.\n\nBut (4,2) has shorter life, so I should eat it soon.\n\nLife span: (4,2) life span 5 from turn 45, so it exists on turns 45,46,47,48,49, gone on 50.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) on turns 45 to 52.\n\nSo I have until turn 49 to eat (4,2).\n\nOn turn 45, I move down.\n\nTurn 46, I can choose to go to (5,2) or (4,3).\n\nIf I go to (4,3) on turn 46, then on turn 47 I can eat (4,2).\n\nIf I go to (5,2) on turn 46, eat (4,2) on turn 47.\n\nSame thing.\n\nAfter eating (4,2), the snake is longer, and I need to access (6,2).\n\nCurrently, the area around (6,2) is crowded.\n\nFor example, from (4,2), after eating, I can move to (5,2) or (3,2) or (4,1), etc.\n\nBut (5,2) might be free or not.\n\nIn the first scenario, after eating at (4,2), from (4,2) I can move to (5,2) if it's free.\n\nIn the position after eating at (4,2) on turn 47, from earlier, positions include (5,2) as body, so I cannot move to (5,2) directly.\n\nIn both cases, after eating at (4,2), the cell (5,2) is occupied by body.\n\nFor example, in option 1: after turn 47 eat at (4,2), positions: (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), etc.\n\nSo (5,2) is body, so from (4,2), I cannot move right to (5,2) because occupied.\n\nSimilarly, U to (4,3) might be occupied or not.\n\nIn the case where I moved to (4,3) before eating, it was free, but after eating, it depends.\n\nLet's take a specific path.\n\nSuppose turn 46: from (5,3) move L to (4,3)\n\nThen turn 47: from (4,3) move D to (4,2) eat food.\n\nPositions after: head (4,2), body (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) 12 segments.\n\nTurn 48: from (4,2), possible moves:\n\n- U to (4,3): but (4,3) is body index 1, occupied, collision\n\n- D to (4,1): free\n\n- L to (3,2): free\n\n- R to (5,2): free? (5,2) not in positions, free\n\nCurrent direction D, so opposite U not allowed.\n\nSo can move D, L, or R.\n\nSay I move R to (5,2).\n\nThen new head (5,2), no food, so tail moves: new positions head (5,2), then (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2) and (6,1) gone, tail at (6,2).\n\n(6,2) has food and is now tail.\n\nTurn 49: from (5,2), possible moves:\n\n- U to (5,3): (5,3) is body index 3, occupied\n\n- D to (5,1): free, not occupied\n\n- L to (4,2): (4,2) is body index 1, occupied\n\n- R to (6,2): (6,2) is tail, so I can move there because it's the tail, and since it moves, it's ok, but (6,2) has food, so if I move there, I eat the food.\n\nBut there is a danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills.\n\nHere, head at (5,2), tail at (6,2), are they adjacent? (5,2) and (6,2) are adjacent horizontally.\n\nSo head is adjacent to tail, and tail has food, so if I eat it, the snake grows a new segment at head, and the tail doesn't move, so the new head and new tail would be at the same position? No.\n\nWhen I eat the food at tail, head moves to (6,2), which was tail, so the tail segment is there, but when I move head to it, since it's food, I eat it, so the tail doesn't move, and a new segment is added, so the snake grows, and the position (6,2) now has head and the new segment, but the previous tail is still there for a moment, but after eating, the positions are: head at (6,2), then the previous head position becomes body, so the segment that was at (5,2) is now behind, and since I ate, tail doesn't move, so the body includes the previous tail position.\n\nLet's see: before move, positions: head (5,2), body (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), tail (6,2)\n\nI move head to (6,2), which is the tail position and has food.\n\nSo I eat the food, so head moves to (6,2), and since food, the tail does not move, so the snake grows: new positions are head at (6,2), then the previous head (5,2) becomes body, then (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), and the previous tail (6,2) is still there but now part of body, and since ate, add new segment, so positions: [(6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)] and the new tail is at (6,3)? Index: 0: (6,2) head, 1: (5,2), 2: (4,2), 3: (4,3), 4: (5,3), 5: (5,4), 6: (4,4), 7: (4,5), 8: (5,5), 9: (6,5), 10: (6,4), 11: (6,3)\n\nBut notice that the head is at (6,2), and the body includes (6,3), (6,4), etc., but (6,3) is index 11, tail.\n\nBut the cell (6,2) was the previous tail, and now head is there, but it's not colliding because it was food.\n\nHowever, the rule says: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nIn this case, before eating, head at (5,2), tail at (6,2), they are adjacent.\n\nTail cell (6,2) has food.\n\nIf I eat it, after eating, head is at (6,2), and the new tail is at (6,3) or wherever, but the new tail is not at (6,2); it's at the end.\n\nThe collision would happen because when the head eats the food at the tail, the tail doesn't move, so the segment that was tail remains, and head is now at that position, but since it's the same cell, it might be ok at that instant, but the problem is that the new tail is grown, and in the next moves, it might collide.\n\nThe rule says: \"the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nAfter eating, the snake has grown, so there is a new segment at the tail end.\n\nBut in terms of position, when you eat at the tail cell, head moves to tail, tail remains, but since head is there, it's not a collision at that point, but the new tail is the same as before or what?\n\nI think there's confusion.\n\nLet's read the rule carefully: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nIn this scenario, before move, head at (5,2), tail at (6,2), adjacent, tail cell has food.\n\nIf I move head to (6,2) to eat, then after eating, head is at (6,2), and the tail is still at (6,2) for that moment? No.\n\nWhen you move head to a cell with food, you eat it, so the head occupies that cell, and the tail does not move, so the previous tail cell is still occupied by the tail segment, but now head is at the same cell? That can't be.\n\nI think I have a misunderstanding.\n\nStandard snake mechanics: when head moves to a food cell, it eats it, so the head is on that cell, and the tail does not move that turn, so the snake grows by one segment.\n\nThe cell that was food is now occupied by head.\n\nThe tail position remains the same as before.\n\nFor example, before move: head at A, tail at Z.\n\nMove head to F, which has food, so after move, head at F, the body segment that was at A is now at A, but since we ate, a new segment is added, so the tail is still at Z, and the new segment is added at F, but head is at F, so the position F now has head, and the body has the previous positions plus F, but since head moved to F, and we add a segment, the body includes the previous head position.\n\nPositions before move: [A, B, C, ..., Z] head A, tail Z.\n\nMove head to F (food), so new positions: [F, A, B, C, ..., Z] head F, tail Z, and since ate, no change to tail, so length increased, tail still Z.\n\nThen on next move, if not eating, head moves, tail moves.\n\nIn this case, F could be any cell, not necessarily related to tail.\n\nBut in the special case, if F is the tail cell, that is, if the food is on the current tail position.\n\nIn our earlier, the food is on (6,2), which is the tail position in some state.\n\nIn the rule, it says \"tail cell has positive food\", meaning the cell where the tail is has food.\n\nAnd if head is adjacent to that cell, and you move to eat it, then after eating, the head is at the tail cell, and the tail is still there, so head and tail are at the same cell? That would be collision.\n\nFor example, positions: head at P, tail at Q, with Q having food, and P adjacent to Q.\n\nMove head to Q to eat food.\n\nAfter move, head is at Q, and tail is at Q, so both at same cell, which is a collision, snake dies.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nIf head moves to a cell that is the tail position and has food, since both occupy the same cell after the move, it's a collision.\n\nOtherwise, if not tail, it's fine.\n\nThe rule says: \"because the head and newly grown tail will collide\" but in this case, it's immediate collision.\n\nIn the description: \"eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\" But newly grown tail is not at that position; the existing tail is there.\n\nI think it's a bit misphrased, but the point is that if you eat food on the tail cell while adjacent, it causes collision because head and tail end up on same cell.\n\nIn other cases, it's fine.\n\nBack to our case.\n\nIn the state where tail is at (6,2) with food, and head is at (5,2), adjacent, if I move to (6,2), I die.\n\nSimilarly, if head is at other adjacent cells.\n\nSo to avoid that, I should not have head adjacent to tail when tail has food.\n\nIn our plan, after eating (4,2), when tail is at (6,2) with food, head is at (4,2) or (5,2), which may not be adjacent to (6,2).\n\nFor example, from (4,2) to (6,2) is not adjacent, distance 2.\n\nFrom (5,2) to (6,2) is adjacent.\n\nIn the case where on turn 48 I move to (5,2), then head at (5,2), tail at (6,2), adjacent, both with food on tail cell, so if I move to (6,2), I die.\n\nBut I don't have to move to (6,2) immediately.\n\nOn turn 49, from (5,2), I can move down to (5,1) or other directions.\n\nFor example, move D to (5,1), which is free.\n\nThen new head (5,1), body: (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), etc., tail (6,2) moves away, so (6,2) vacated, food there, now free to eat.\n\nTail was at (6,2), after move to (5,1), no food, so tail moves: new positions head (5,1), then (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3) and (6,2) gone, so (6,2) is free with food.\n\nThen head at (5,1), I can move to (6,1) or (5,0) but y=0 is wall, so cannot down.\n\n(5,1) to (6,1) right, or (4,1) left, or (5,2) up but occupied.\n\nFrom (5,1), adjacent:\n\n- U to (5,2): occupied by body\n\n- D to (5,0): y=0 wall, collision\n\n- L to (4,1): free? Not occupied\n\n- R to (6,1): (6,1) is in positions? New positions: after move to (5,1), positions: head (5,1), then (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3) tail at (6,3)\n\n(6,1) not occupied, free.\n\n(4,1) free.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (4,1) is within bounds.\n\nSo from (5,1), can move L to (4,1) or R to (6,1).\n\nThen to reach (6,2), from (6,1) I can move up to (6,2) if free.\n\nAfter the move, (6,2) is free with food.\n\nSo on turn 50, from (6,1), I can move U to (6,2) to eat food.\n\nBut let's see the turn count.\n\nTurn 45: move D to (5,3)\n\nTurn 46: let's say move L to (4,3) to be closer to (4,2)\n\nThen turn 47: move D to (4,2) eat food\n\nTurn 48: from (4,2), move say R to (5,2) or other.\n\nTo avoid being adjacent to tail with food, on turn 48, from (4,2), instead of moving to (5,2), move D to (4,1) or L to (3,2).\n\nSay move D to (4,1)\n\nThen new head (4,1), no food, so tail moves: previous positions head (4,2), body (4,3), (5,3), etc., tail (6,1)\n\nAfter move to (4,1), head (4,1), then (4,2) neck, then (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2) and (6,1) gone, tail at (6,2)\n\n(6,2) has food and is tail.\n\nHead at (4,1), not adjacent to (6,2), so safe.\n\nThen I can move towards (6,2).\n\nBut (4,1) to (6,2) is far, and (6,2) life span until turn 52, so I have time.\n\nTurn 49: from (4,1), possible moves:\n\n- U to (4,2): (4,2) is body index 1, occupied\n\n- D to (4,0): y=0 wall, collision\n\n- L to (3,1): free\n\n- R to (5,1): free\n\nCurrent direction D (moved down), so opposite U not allowed.\n\nSo can move L to (3,1) or R to (5,1).\n\nSay move R to (5,1).\n\nThen new head (5,1), body: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), etc., tail (6,2) removed, so (6,2) free with food.\n\nPositions: head (5,1), then (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3) tail at (6,3)\n\n(6,2) is free.\n\nFrom (5,1), I can move to (6,1) or (5,0) but wall, or (4,1) occupied, or (5,2) occupied.\n\n(5,2) is body index 2? Positions: index0: (5,1), index1: (4,1), index2: (4,2), index3: (4,3), index4: (5,3), etc.\n\n(5,2) not occupied, free? No, (5,2) is not in the list, so free.\n\nAdjacent cells to (5,1):\n\n- U: (5,2) - not occupied, free\n\n- D: (5,0) - y=0 wall\n\n- L: (4,1) - occupied, body\n\n- R: (6,1) - free, not occupied\n\nSo can move U to (5,2) or R to (6,1).\n\nThen to eat (6,2), from (6,1) move U to (6,2) or from (5,2) move R to (6,2).\n\nTurn 50: if at (6,1), move U to (6,2) eat food.\n\nOr if at (5,2), move R to (6,2) eat.\n\nBut need to be careful not to be adjacent when tail has food, but in this case, when I move to eat, tail doesn't have food at that time.\n\nIn turn 50, (6,2) is free with food, no tail there.\n\nSo safe to eat.\n\nNow, back to turn 46 choice.\n\nFor turn 45, only D.\n\nTurn 46, I can choose to go to (4,3) or (5,2).\n\nIf I go to (4,3), I can eat (4,2) on turn 47.\n\nIf I go to (5,2), I can eat (4,2) on turn 47 as well.\n\nBut going to (4,3) might be better because from (4,3) to (4,2) is down, and after eating, I have more space to move.\n\nFrom (5,2), after eating, I am closer to the right side.\n\nBut since I need to go to (6,2) later, it might be similar.\n\nI should also consider the internal obstacle at (4,6), but it's not relevant yet.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (6,2) is under body, but in the initial state, it's occupied, so I need to free it.\n\nIn the path above, by moving, it gets freed when tail moves.\n\nIn the plan, I can eat both foods.\n\nFirst, eat (4,2) by turn 47.\n\nThen by turn 50, eat (6,2).\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nSince the question is to think 5+ turns ahead, and maximize score, eating both foods is good.\n\nAlso, avoid risks.\n\nNow for turn 45, action must be D.\n\nThen turn 46, let's choose to move to (4,3) to be direct.\n\nSo turn 46: L to (4,3)\n\nTurn 47: D to (4,2) eat food.\n\nThen turn 48: from (4,2), I need to move away. Options: D to (4,1) or L to (3,2) or R to (5,2) but R might not be allowed if direction, but direction is D, so R is perpendicular, allowed.\n\nBut to avoid potential issue, move D to (4,1) or L to (3,2).\n\nSay move D to (4,1) to go down.\n\nThen turn 49: from (4,1), move R to (5,1) or L to (3,1).\n\nSay move R to (5,1) to go towards right.\n\nThen turn 50: from (5,1), move U to (5,2) or R to (6,1).\n\nIf move U to (5,2), then turn 51 from (5,2) move R to (6,2) if free, but at that time (6,2) may not be free yet.\n\nLet's timeline.\n\nTurn 45: move D to (5,3)\n\nTurn 46: move L to (4,3)\n\nTurn 47: move D to (4,2) eat food at (4,2), snake length 12\n\nPositions: head (4,2), body (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)\n\nTurn 48: move D to (4,1)  // no food, so tail moves\n\nNew positions: head (4,1), then (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2) tail at (6,2) with food\n\nTurn 49: from (4,1), move R to (5,1)  // no food, tail moves\n\nNew positions: head (5,1), then (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3) tail at (6,3)\n\n(6,2) is now free with food.\n\nFrom (5,1), I can move U to (5,2) or R to (6,1)\n\n(5,2) is free, (6,1) is free.\n\nSay move U to (5,2)\n\nThen new head (5,2), no food, tail moves: positions head (5,2), then (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4) tail at (6,4)\n\n(6,2) still free with food.\n\nTurn 50: from (5,2), possible moves:\n\n- U to (5,3): (5,3) is body index 4? Positions: index0: (5,2), index1: (5,1), index2: (4,1), index3: (4,2), index4: (4,3), index5: (5,3), index6: (5,4), index7: (4,4), index8: (4,5), index9: (5,5), index10: (6,5), index11: (6,4)\n\n(5,3) is index5, body, occupied\n\n- D to (5,1): (5,1) is index1, body, occupied\n\n- L to (4,2): (4,2) is index3, body, occupied\n\n- R to (6,2): (6,2) is free, has food, so can move there to eat.\n\nAlso, current direction U (since moved up to (5,2)), so opposite D not allowed.\n\nCan move R to (6,2) to eat.\n\nYes.\n\nSo turn 50: move R to (6,2) eat food.\n\nPerfect.\n\nIf on turn 49 I moved R to (6,1), then from (6,1) turn 50 move U to (6,2) eat.\n\nAlso fine.\n\nSo both foods eaten.\n\nNow for the answer, I need to output actions.\n\nBut I need to specify the actions.\n\nFor turn 45: D\n\nTurn 46: L (to (4,3))\n\nTurn 47: D (to (4,2) eat)\n\nThen turn 48: D (to (4,1))\n\nTurn 49: R (to (5,1))\n\nTurn 50: U (to (5,2)) or directly to (6,2) if possible, but from (5,1) to (6,2) not adjacent, so must go to (5,2) or (6,1) first.\n\nIn the above, I went to (5,2) on turn 50? Turn 49 from (4,1) move R to (5,1), then turn 50 from (5,1) move U to (5,2), then turn 51 to (6,2).\n\nBut on turn 50, from (5,1), I could move R to (6,1), then U to (6,2) on turn 51.\n\nBut (6,2) food disappears after turn 52, so turn 51 is ok.\n\nTo save turns, but not necessary.\n\nSince on turn 49, after moving to (5,1), (6,2) is free, and from (5,1) I can move to (6,1), then on turn 50 move to (6,2).\n\nBut from (5,1) to (6,1) is R, then to (6,2) is U.\n\nIn terms of turns, same as moving to (5,2) then (6,2).\n\nBut moving directly towards (6,2) might be better.\n\nFrom (5,1), moving R to (6,1) is fine.\n\nThen turn 50: U to (6,2) eat.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 45: D\n\nTurn 46: L\n\nTurn 47: D\n\nTurn 48: D\n\nTurn 49: R  (to (5,1)? From (4,1) to (5,1) is right, so R.\n\nTurn 50: U  (from (6,1) to (6,2)? After turn 49, head at (5,1), move R to (6,1), then turn 50 from (6,1) move U to (6,2).\n\nBut (6,1) to (6,2) is up, U.\n\nAnd eat.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output up to turn 50 or so.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", and from turn 45, 5 turns to 50.\n\nBut I can output more if needed, but the format is to show actions for several turns.\n\nAlso, in turn 48, I moved D to (4,1), but I could move L to (3,2), but D is fine.\n\nNow, to confirm, on turn 46, if I had moved down to (5,2) instead, similar outcome.\n\nBut with L to (4,3), it might be slightly better for accessing left side, but not crucial.\n\nSo I'll go with this.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 45: D (down)\n\nTurn 46: L (left)\n\nTurn 47: D (down) to eat (4,2)\n\nTurn 48: D (down) to (4,1)\n\nTurn 49: R (right) to (5,1)\n\nTurn 50: U (up) to (6,2)? From (5,1) to (6,2) not adjacent, so on turn 50, from (6,1) to (6,2) U.\n\nAfter turn 49 move R to (6,1), head at (6,1), then turn 50 move U to (6,2) to eat.\n\nBut on turn 49, from (4,1) I move R to (5,1), not to (6,1).\n\nFrom (4,1) to (6,1) is not adjacent; must go to (5,1) first or (4,2) but occupied.\n\nSo turn 49: from (4,1) move R to (5,1)\n\nThen turn 50: from (5,1) move R to (6,1)  // since U to (5,2) or R to (6,1)\n\nIf I move R to (6,1), then turn 51: U to (6,2) eat.\n\nBut (6,2) life span until turn 52, so turn 51 is fine.\n\nTo eat on turn 50, I need to be at (6,1) or (5,2) or (7,2) but x=7 wall.\n\nFrom (5,1), I can move to (6,1) on turn 50, but then eat on turn 51.\n\nIf on turn 50 I move to (5,2), then on turn 51 to (6,2).\n\nSame.\n\nBut on turn 50, if at (5,1), I move to (5,2), then turn 51 to (6,2).\n\nBut (5,2) might be free, as before.\n\nIn positions after turn 49 move to (5,1): positions include (4,2), (4,3), etc., (5,2) not occupied, free.\n\nSo from (5,1) turn 50 move U to (5,2), then turn 51 move R to (6,2) eat.\n\nOr from (5,1) turn 50 move R to (6,1), turn 51 move U to (6,2).\n\nEither way.\n\nSince from (5,2) to (6,2) is direct, and (5,2) is on the way.\n\nBut not important.\n\nFor the answer, I can output up to turn 50, and imply further.\n\nBut let's list the actions.\n\nAlso, for the boxed answer.\n\nSo for turns:\n\nTurn 45: D\n\nTurn 46: L\n\nTurn 47: D\n\nTurn 48: D  (to (4,1))\n\nNow turn 49: from (4,1) move R to (5,1)  // action R\n\nTurn 50: from (5,1) move U to (5,2)  // action U\n\nThen turn 51: from (5,2) move R to (6,2) eat  // action R\n\nBut I need to output in the format.\n\nSince the food at (6,2) can be eaten later, but for the response, I think outputting 5-6 turns is fine.\n\nPerhaps start with turn 45 to 50.\n\nIn turn 48, I moved D, but I could move L to (3,2) for exploration, but not necessary.\n\nI think D is fine.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 45: D\n\nTurn 46: L\n\nTurn 47: D\n\nTurn 48: D\n\nTurn 49: R\n\nTurn 50: U  (to (5,2))\n\nThen further turns to eat (6,2), but not required.\n\nIn the answer format, I can show until turn 50.\n\nNow to write the boxed answer.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 45):**\n- **Grid**: 8x8 with walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacle at (4,6).\n- **Snake**: Head at (5,4) moving right (direction R). Body segments: [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)] (length 11).\n- **Food**:\n  - (4,2): Value +1, life span 5 (disappears after turn 49).\n  - (6,2): Value +1, life span 8 (disappears after turn 52), but currently under body segment at (6,2) (index 7 in initial positions).\n\n**Immediate Constraints and Risks:**\n- **Turn 45 Movement**: From (5,4), only possible safe move is down (D) to (5,3), as other directions (U, L, R) lead to body collisions, and D is not opposite to current direction R.\n- **Food Prioritization**: \n  - (4,2) must be eaten by turn 49 due to short life span. It is unoccupied and accessible via a short path.\n  - (6,2) is under the body but can be eaten after the segment moves away. It has a longer life span (until turn 52), so it can be targeted after (4,2).\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: Avoid having the head adjacent to the tail if the tail cell has food, as eating it causes collision. After eating (4,2), the tail may temporarily occupy (6,2) with food, but the head can be positioned to avoid adjacency.\n- **5+ Turn Plan**: Focus on eating (4,2) by turn 47, then maneuver to eat (6,2) by turn 51. Survival is prioritized by avoiding dead ends and collisions. The internal obstacle (4,6) is not immediately relevant.\n\n**Path Plan (Turns 45-51):**\n1. **Turn 45**: Move down (D) to (5,3) – only safe option.\n2. **Turn 46**: Move left (L) to (4,3) – positions head closer to (4,2) for efficient eating next turn.\n3. **Turn 47**: Move down (D) to (4,2) – eat (4,2); snake grows to length 12.\n4. **Turn 48**: Move down (D) to (4,1) – avoids potential adjacency with future tail position and opens space.\n5. **Turn 49**: Move right (R) to (5,1) – moves toward (6,2) area; frees (6,2) by causing tail to move away.\n6. **Turn 50**: Move up (U) to (5,2) – prepares for direct move to (6,2); (6,2) is now free and has food.\n7. **Turn 51**: Move right (R) to (6,2) – eat (6,2); snake grows to length 13.\n\n**Why this plan maximizes score and ensures survival:**\n- **Eats both foods**: Secures +2 score increase by turn 51, utilizing full life spans.\n- **Avoids risks**:\n  - No collisions: All moves avoid walls, obstacles, and body segments.\n  - Tail reward danger mitigated: When tail occupies (6,2) with food (around turn 48), head is at (4,1) or (5,1), not adjacent.\n  - No dead ends: Path keeps the snake in open areas; after turn 51, the snake can explore safely (e.g., move to (6,1) or (5,3)).\n- **Efficiency**: (4,2) eaten early (turn 47) before expiration; (6,2) eaten by turn 51 with 2 turns to spare.\n- **Long-term**: After turn 51, the snake can seek new food or navigate freely, with no immediate threats.\n\n**Answer Format (Actions for Turns 45-51):**\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 45: D (down)  \nTurn 46: L (left)  \nTurn 47: D (down)  \nTurn 48: D (down)  \nTurn 49: R (right)  \nTurn 50: U (up)  \nTurn 51: R (right)\n}",

        "score": 10,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 46, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and one internal obstacle at (4,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the borders and an obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (5,3), and the body segments follow: (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1). Since the head is at (5,3) and direction is down, that means it's moving down to (5,2) or something? Direction is given as D, which is down, so from (5,3), moving down would be to (5,2), but (5,2) isn't listed, so maybe it's about to move or something. Let's list all positions:\n\nSnake positions: [(5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)]\n\nHead is (5,3), and direction is down. Since direction is down, the snake was moving down to reach (5,3)? No, the positions are the current positions. So at turn 46, snake head is at (5,3), and it's facing down, meaning it just moved to (5,3) from above? Let's think.\n\nThe positions are given in order: head first, then body. So head at (5,3), then (5,4) which is above it, so the snake is moving downwards because from (5,4) to (5,3) is down. Direction is given as D, down, which matches: it moved down to (5,3).\n\nNow, the body: from head (5,3), next is (5,4), which is directly above, then (4,4) which is left of that, then (4,5) up from (4,4)? (4,4) to (4,5) is up, but since the snake is moving, the segments are connected.\n\nLet's trace the snake: head (5,3), then neck (5,4), then (4,4), then (4,5), then (5,5), then (6,5), then (6,4), then (6,3), then (6,2), then (6,1), then tail (5,1).\n\nSo the snake is long, 11 segments.\n\nFood:\n\n- (4,2) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (6,2) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (1,3) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food mentioned.\n\nLife span decreases each turn, including current turn, so for (4,2), life span 4 at turn 46, so it will disappear after 4 more turns? Life span is the number of turns it will last, including current, so after N turns, it disappears.\n\nFor example, food at (4,2) with life span 4: at turn 46, life span 4, meaning it will disappear after turn 46 + 4 - 1 or something? Let's clarify.\n\nThe rule says: \"life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo, at turn t, if life span is L, it decreases to L-1 at turn t+1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears. So for (4,2) at turn 46, life span 4, so it will disappear after 4 turns, meaning at turn 50 it will be gone? After N turns means: if it appears at turn T with life span N, it lasts from turn T to turn T+N-1, and disappears at turn T+N.\n\nBut here, it's given at current turn, so for turn 46, life span 4, so it will disappear at turn 46 + 4 = 50. Similarly, (6,2) life span 7, disappears at turn 46+7=53, and (1,3) life span 10, disappears at 46+10=56.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves for multiple turns ahead. Think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's visualize the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, walls at borders, so cells (0,y), (7,y) for all y, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x, but since it's borders, x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (5,3)\n\nBody: (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)\n\nSo let's list all occupied cells:\n\n- (5,3): head\n\n- (5,4)\n\n- (4,4)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (5,5)\n\n- (6,5)\n\n- (6,4)\n\n- (6,3)\n\n- (6,2)\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (5,1)\n\nAlso, walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (4,6)\n\nFood: (4,2), (6,2), (1,3)\n\n(6,2) is a food position, but (6,2) is also occupied by the snake! (6,2) is part of the snake body. Let's see: snake positions include (6,2), which is the 8th segment? Positions: index 0: (5,3) head, 1: (5,4), 2: (4,4), 3: (4,5), 4: (5,5), 5: (6,5), 6: (6,4), 7: (6,3), 8: (6,2), 9: (6,1), 10: (5,1) tail.\n\nSo (6,2) is occupied by the snake body.\n\nBut food is at (6,2) with life span 7 and value 1.\n\nAccording to the rules: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nSo (6,2) has food under it, but since the snake is on it, it can't be eaten yet. The body must move away first.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) is food, not occupied, I think. Let's check: snake positions: (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1). So (4,2) is not in this list, so it's free. Similarly, (1,3) is not occupied.\n\n(4,2) is at x=4,y=2, which is not in snake positions, so it's accessible.\n\n(6,2) is occupied, so food is under the body.\n\n(1,3) is free.\n\nHead at (5,3), direction down.\n\nPossible moves: since direction is down, I can move down, left, or right, but not up because that would be reverse, and no instant reverse.\n\nCurrent direction is down, so I cannot move up on the next turn. Allowed moves: down (same), left, or right.\n\nNow, coordinates: moving down from (5,3) would be to (5,2).\n\nLeft: (4,3)\n\nRight: (6,3)\n\nBut (6,3) is occupied by snake body? (6,3) is position index 7, which is a body segment.\n\nCollision: if head moves to a body segment, it dies, except for the tail, because the tail moves.\n\nImportant: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, if the head moves to the tail position, it's ok because the tail moves, so no collision.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (5,1).\n\nNow, for (6,3): it's a body segment, not the tail, so if head moves to (6,3), it would collide and die.\n\nSimilarly, other body segments.\n\nNow, possible moves from (5,3):\n\n- Down: to (5,2)\n\n- Left: to (4,3)\n\n- Right: to (6,3)\n\n(6,3) is occupied by body at index 7, which is not tail, so moving right to (6,3) would cause collision.\n\n(4,3) : is it occupied? Snake positions: (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), etc. No (4,3), so (4,3) is free.\n\n(5,2) : not in snake positions, so free.\n\nAlso, walls: (5,2) is y=2, not border, so not wall. Borders are y=0 and y=7, x=0, x=7.\n\ny=0 is bottom, I assume? Typically, y increases up or down? In the movement, U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, so y=0 is the bottom row, y=7 is top row? Let's see.\n\nMovement: U (x,y+1) — so if y increases, it's moving up, so higher y is up, lower y is down.\n\nIn coordinates, (x,y), U: y+1, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top.\n\nSimilarly, D: y-1, down.\n\nL: x-1, left\n\nR: x+1, right\n\nWalls: x=0 left border, x=7 right border, y=0 bottom, y=7 top.\n\nInternal obstacle (4,6).\n\nNow, (5,2): x=5, y=2, not border, not obstacle, not occupied by snake except possibly tail, but tail is at (5,1), so (5,2) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3): x=4,y=3, not border, not obstacle, not in snake positions, so free.\n\n(6,3): occupied by body segment at (6,3), which is not tail, so moving there would collide.\n\nTherefore, possible moves: down to (5,2) or left to (4,3). Right to (6,3) is invalid.\n\nNow, food: (4,2) at (4,2), which is below and left of head? Head at (5,3), (4,2) is left and down.\n\n(6,2) at (6,2), which has food under body, but snake is on it.\n\n(1,3) at (1,3), far left.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n\nFirst, let's consider the immediate move.\n\nIf I move down to (5,2), then head to (5,2), which is not food, since food is at (4,2) and (6,2), (1,3). (5,2) no food, so no eating, snake moves, tail moves, so length same.\n\nThen next position: head at (5,2), direction down.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (5,1), but (5,1) is tail? Tail is at (5,1), so if I move down to (5,1), since it's tail, it should be ok, but let's see the positions.\n\nAfter move down to (5,2), the new positions: head moves to (5,2), then the body: the old head (5,3) becomes neck, so positions: new head (5,2), then (5,3), then (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), and tail (5,1) moves? When head moves, the tail moves only if no food eaten. Since no food, tail moves forward.\n\nSnake movement: when head moves to new cell, if not food, then tail is removed, so snake shortens? No.\n\nStandard snake: when head moves to new cell, if no food, tail moves, so the snake shifts, length same.\n\nIf food eaten, tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n\nHere, if no food, head moves to new cell, tail is removed from the end.\n\nSo after moving down to (5,2), no food eaten.\n\nNew positions: head at (5,2), then the first body segment is the old head (5,3), then (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), and the tail (5,1) is removed? Positions: the snake had 11 segments. After move, head moves to (5,2), so the body from (5,3) to (5,1) shifts: the segment that was at index 1 (5,4) moves to where index 0 was, but it's a chain.\n\nThe new head is at (5,2), then the next segment is the previous head (5,3), then the segment that was after that (5,4), then (4,4), and so on, up to (6,1), and the tail (5,1) is removed, so now snake has 10 segments? Let's list.\n\nOriginal positions: [ (5,3) head, (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1) tail ]\n\nAfter moving down to (5,2): new head at (5,2), then the body: the segment that was head is now first body at (5,3), then (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), and the tail (5,1) is removed, so no (5,1) anymore. The new tail is (6,1).\n\nPositions: [ (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) ]? (6,1) was the second last, and (5,1) was tail, removed.\n\nAfter move: head to (5,2), then previous positions from index 0 to 9 become the new body, but index 0 was head, now it's the first body segment at (5,3), index 1 was (5,4) now at position of index 0, etc., but the positions shift: the segment that was at (5,3) is now at (5,3) but it's body, not head.\n\nThe list of positions: the new head is (5,2), then the previous head (5,3) is now the first body segment, then the previous body segments are the same, but the last one, the tail, is removed.\n\nSo from the list: after move to (5,2), positions: [ (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) ]? Let's count: original 11 segments. After move, head new position, so we add (5,2) as head, and keep all except the tail is removed, so we have 11 positions but the last is removed, so 10 segments? No.\n\nStandard: when snake moves, the head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in front of it, and the tail segment is removed if no food eaten.\n\nSo the new positions: the head is at new position, then each subsequent segment is at the position of the previous segment before the move.\n\nFor example, after moving down to (5,2):\n\n- New head: (5,2)\n\n- New segment 1: old head position (5,3)\n\n- New segment 2: old segment 1 position (5,4)\n\n- New segment 3: old segment 2 position (4,4)\n\n- New segment 4: old segment 3 position (4,5)\n\n- New segment 5: old segment 4 position (5,5)\n\n- New segment 6: old segment 5 position (6,5)\n\n- New segment 7: old segment 6 position (6,4)\n\n- New segment 8: old segment 7 position (6,3)\n\n- New segment 9: old segment 8 position (6,2)\n\n- New segment 10: old segment 9 position (6,1)\n\nOld segment 9 was (6,1), old segment 10 was (5,1) tail, removed. So new segments from 0 to 9, 10 segments? Old indices: let's index from 0.\n\nOld: 0: (5,3) head, 1: (5,4), 2: (4,4), 3: (4,5), 4: (5,5), 5: (6,5), 6: (6,4), 7: (6,3), 8: (6,2), 9: (6,1), 10: (5,1) tail.\n\nAfter move to (5,2), new head at (5,2), then:\n\n- New body 1: old head (5,3)\n\n- New body 2: old body 1 (5,4)\n\n- New body 3: old body 2 (4,4)\n\n- New body 4: old body 3 (4,5)\n\n- New body 5: old body 4 (5,5)\n\n- New body 6: old body 5 (6,5)\n\n- New body 7: old body 6 (6,4)\n\n- New body 8: old body 7 (6,3)\n\n- New body 9: old body 8 (6,2)\n\n- New body 10: old body 9 (6,1)\n\nAnd old tail (5,1) removed, so no new body 11. So now snake has 11 segments? New head and 10 bodies, so 11 segments? Let's count: new positions: head (5,2), then 10 body segments: from old 0 to 9, but old 0 is now body 1 at (5,3), old 1 is body 2 at (5,4), ..., old 9 is body 10 at (6,1). So positions: [ (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) ] — that's 11 positions, but the tail is now at (6,1), and (5,1) is free.\n\nIn terms of length, since no food eaten, length should be the same, 11 segments. Yes, the snake didn't grow, so it has the same number of segments, but the tail moved to (6,1), and head is at (5,2).\n\nSimilarly, if I move left to (4,3), head to (4,3), not food, so new positions: head (4,3), then old head (5,3), then (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), and tail (5,1) removed, so positions: [ (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) ]\n\nTail at (6,1).\n\nNow, back to choices at turn 46: move down to (5,2) or left to (4,3).\n\nIf I move down to (5,2), then head at (5,2), direction down.\n\nFrom there, I can move down to (5,1), but (5,1) is not occupied now? In the new positions, (5,1) is free, but it's y=1, not wall.\n\n(5,1) was tail, but after move, it's free.\n\nFrom (5,2), move down to (5,1): (5,1) is free, no food, so ok.\n\nOr left to (4,2), which has food.\n\nOr right to (6,2), but (6,2) is occupied by body? In new positions after moving down, (6,2) is occupied by a body segment (new body 9 at (6,2)? Let's see the positions after moving down to (5,2): positions are [ (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) ]\n\nSo (6,2) is occupied by the 10th segment? Indices: 0: head (5,2), 1: (5,3), 2: (5,4), 3: (4,4), 4: (4,5), 5: (5,5), 6: (6,5), 7: (6,4), 8: (6,3), 9: (6,2), 10: (6,1) tail.\n\nSo (6,2) is body segment at index 9, not tail, so moving to (6,2) from (5,2) would cause collision.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) is free, and has food.\n\n(5,1) is free, no food.\n\n(6,1) is tail, but from (5,2), moving right to (6,2) is invalid, moving down to (5,1), left to (4,2), or up to (5,3), but (5,3) is occupied by body index 1, so cannot move up.\n\nDirection after moving down to (5,2) is down, so possible moves: down, left, right.\n\nDown to (5,1), left to (4,2), right to (6,2) but (6,2) occupied, invalid.\n\nSo from (5,2), can go down to (5,1) or left to (4,2).\n\nIf go left to (4,2), there is food, so eat it, length increases, tail doesn't move.\n\nFood at (4,2) has value +1, so snake grows.\n\nIf go down to (5,1), no food, continue.\n\nBut let's not get ahead; first, at turn 46, I need to choose.\n\nAnother choice: at turn 46, move left to (4,3).\n\nThen head to (4,3), not food, so new positions: head (4,3), then old head (5,3), then (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), tail removed, so positions: [ (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) ] tail at (6,1).\n\nDirection: moved left, so direction now L.\n\nFrom (4,3), possible moves: left to (3,3), down to (4,2), up to (4,4), but (4,4) is occupied by body index 3? Positions: index 0: (4,3) head, 1: (5,3), 2: (5,4), 3: (4,4), 4: (4,5), etc.\n\nSo (4,4) is body, so moving up to (4,4) would collide.\n\nDown to (4,2) has food.\n\nLeft to (3,3) is free.\n\nRight to (5,3) but (5,3) is body index 1, occupied, invalid.\n\nSo from (4,3), can go left to (3,3) or down to (4,2) to eat food.\n\nNow, the food at (6,2) is under the body. In the current state, at turn 46, (6,2) has food under snake body. To eat it, the body must move away first.\n\nAfter some moves, if the snake moves so that (6,2) is vacated, then head can move to it to eat.\n\nBut it has life span 7, so it will disappear at turn 53.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) has life span 4, disappear at turn 50.\n\n(1,3) at (1,3) with life span 10, disappear at 56.\n\nNow, I need to plan for multiple turns, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nAlso, there's a danger with tail: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because the head and new tail collide.\n\nBut currently, tail is at (5,1), head at (5,3), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (5,3) and (5,1) are not adjacent, since (5,2) is between them.\n\nNow, let's think about the grid layout.\n\nThe snake is mostly on the right side, with a loop.\n\nI should consider going for the food at (4,2) or (6,2), but (6,2) is under body.\n\nFirst, let's list all free cells or something.\n\nPerhaps I can simulate a few moves.\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the answer format is for a sequence of actions, but it doesn't specify how many turns, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan a sequence for about 5 turns or so.\n\nThe boxed answer should have actions for turns t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't say how many, but probably for the next few turns until a decision point or something.\n\nSince the food has life span, I need to consider timing.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (4,6) might block paths.\n\nLet's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid 8x8, rows y=0 to 7 (bottom to top), columns x=0 to 7 (left to right).\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No, borders are walls, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, so the playable cells are x=1 to 6, y=1 to6, except the internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is at y=6, which is top row? y=7 is top wall, so y=6 is below that.\n\ny=0 bottom, y=7 top, so y=1 to 6 are playable rows.\n\nSimilarly x=1 to 6 playable columns.\n\nBut (4,6) is an obstacle, so not accessible.\n\nNow snake positions at turn 46:\n\nHead: (5,3)\n\nBody: (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)\n\nSo let's plot:\n\nRow y=6: (4,6) obstacle, and (5,5), (6,5) are body, but (5,5) is at y=5? Positions:\n\n(4,5) at x=4,y=5\n\n(5,5) at x=5,y=5\n\n(6,5) at x=6,y=5\n\ny=6: only (4,6) obstacle, no other, so (4,6) is at y=6.\n\ny=5: (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)\n\ny=4: (4,4), (5,4), (6,4)\n\ny=3: (5,3) head, (6,3)\n\ny=2: (6,2)\n\ny=1: (6,1), (5,1)\n\nAnd food at (4,2), (6,2), (1,3)\n\n(6,2) is occupied by snake.\n\n(4,2) is at y=2, x=4, free.\n\n(1,3) at x=1,y=3, free.\n\nNow, at turn 46, I can move down to (5,2) or left to (4,3).\n\nIf I move left to (4,3), then head at (4,3), and I can immediately move down to (4,2) to eat the food at (4,2) on turn 47.\n\nBut life span of (4,2) is 4 at turn 46, so if I eat it on turn 47, it's fine, since it will be there.\n\nTurn 46: if I move left to (4,3), no eat.\n\nThen turn 47: from (4,3), I can move down to (4,2) to eat food.\n\nAfter eating, length increases, tail doesn't move.\n\nBut let's see the tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it causes collision.\n\nHere, after moving to (4,3), tail is at (5,1), not adjacent to (4,3) or (4,2).\n\nAfter eating at (4,2), head at (4,2), and the body grows, so tail stays where it was.\n\nBut (4,2) is food, so when head moves to (4,2), it eats, so the snake grows: new head at (4,2), body: previous positions from head to before tail, and tail doesn't move, so length increases by one.\n\nPositions: after moving to (4,2) and eating, new head at (4,2), then the previous head (4,3) becomes body, then previous bodies, and tail remains, so snake longer.\n\nNo immediate danger.\n\nBut let's consider the other move.\n\nIf at turn 46 I move down to (5,2), then on turn 47, from (5,2) I can move left to (4,2) to eat the food, or down to (5,1).\n\nIf I move left to (4,2) on turn 47, I eat the food.\n\nSo either way, I can eat the food at (4,2) by turn 47.\n\nWith left move first, I eat on turn 47 directly.\n\nWith down then left, I also eat on turn 47.\n\nBut with down move at turn 46, I go to (5,2), then to (4,2) on turn 47.\n\nWith left move at turn 46 to (4,3), then to (4,2) on turn 47.\n\nSo similar, but the position after turn 47 is different.\n\nIf I go via (4,3): after turn 47, head at (4,2), positions include (4,3) as body, etc.\n\nIf I go via (5,2): after turn 47, head at (4,2), with body from (5,2), (5,3), etc.\n\nBut (5,2) is not occupied in the first case.\n\nNow, there is food at (6,2) under the body.\n\nAt turn 46, (6,2) is occupied by body segment.\n\nIn the snake positions, (6,2) is index 8 or something.\n\nAs the snake moves, that segment will move away.\n\nFor example, if I do nothing, but I have to move.\n\nSuppose at turn 46 I move down to (5,2).\n\nThen positions as above: head (5,2), body (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) tail.\n\n(6,2) is still occupied by body index 9.\n\nThen on turn 47, if I move left to (4,2) to eat food, then new head at (4,2), and since food eaten, tail doesn't move, so positions: head (4,2), then previous head (5,2) becomes body, then (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), and tail (6,1) remains, but (6,1) was tail, now it is the last body, and a new segment is added at the tail position? No.\n\nWhen food is eaten, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail does not move, so the snake grows by one segment at the head position.\n\nSo positions: new head at food cell, then the previous head becomes the first body segment, and the rest of the body is the same, and the tail stays, so the snake has one more segment.\n\nFor example, after moving to (4,2) and eating, new positions: head (4,2), then previous head (5,2), then previous body 1 (5,3), then (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), and the tail (6,1) is still there, but now it's not the tail anymore; the new tail is (6,1), but since it didn't move, it's the same cell, but now it's part of the body, and the segment that was before it is the new second last.\n\nList: after eating at (4,2) from (5,2):\n\n- New head: (4,2)\n\n- New body 1: old head (5,2)\n\n- New body 2: old body 1 (5,3)\n\n- New body 3: old body 2 (5,4)\n\n- New body 4: old body 3 (4,4)\n\n- New body 5: old body 4 (4,5)\n\n- New body 6: old body 5 (5,5)\n\n- New body 7: old body 6 (6,5)\n\n- New body 8: old body 7 (6,4)\n\n- New body 9: old body 8 (6,3)\n\n- New body 10: old body 9 (6,2)\n\n- New body 11: old tail (6,1)  // since tail didn't move\n\nAnd new tail is (6,1)\n\nOld tail was (6,1), now it's still there, but the snake grew, so positions from old head to old tail are all there, plus the new head position.\n\nOld positions before move: head (5,2), body (5,3) to (6,1), 10 bodies? Earlier: after move to (5,2), positions: [ (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) ] 11 segments.\n\nThen move to (4,2) and eat, so new head at (4,2), then the previous positions all remain, so new positions: [ (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) ] 12 segments, tail at (6,1).\n\n(6,2) is still occupied by body.\n\nTo eat the food at (6,2), I need to move the snake so that the body moves away from (6,2), then head can move to it.\n\nCurrently, (6,2) is occupied.\n\nIn the above, after eating at (4,2), (6,2) is still occupied.\n\nThe food at (6,2) has life span 7, so it will be there until turn 53.\n\nI can plan to eat it later.\n\nThere is also food at (1,3), which is far, life span 10, so I have time.\n\nBut I need to avoid risks.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (4,6) might block the top row.\n\nNow, let's think about the tail reward danger.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (5,1), but after moves, it changes.\n\nFor example, if I eat the food at (4,2), the tail might move or not.\n\nBut at (4,2), no issue.\n\nNow, the food at (6,2) is on the tail path or something.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the state after eating (4,2).\n\nBut let's decide the first move.\n\nI could go for the food at (1,3), but it's far, and there are closer foods.\n\n(4,2) is close, life span short, 4 turns, so I should eat it soon.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) has longer life span.\n\nAt turn 46, if I move left to (4,3), then on turn 47 move down to (4,2) to eat.\n\nThen head at (4,2), direction down (since moved down).\n\nFrom there, I can move down to (4,1), but y=1, not wall, or left to (3,2), or right to (5,2), etc.\n\n(4,1) is free, no food.\n\n(3,2) free.\n\n(5,2) might be occupied or not, but after eating, positions: head (4,2), body (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), etc., so (5,2) is free.\n\nAfter eating at (4,2) on turn 47, positions as above: head (4,2), body (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) tail.\n\nSo (5,2) is free.\n\nFrom (4,2), direction down, so can move down to (4,1), left to (3,2), right to (5,2), or up to (4,3) but (4,3) is body, occupied, so invalid.\n\nSo possible: down, left, right.\n\n(4,1) is y=1, not wall, free.\n\n(3,2) free.\n\n(5,2) free.\n\nNow, food at (6,2) is still under body at (6,2), so cannot eat yet.\n\nI need to move the snake so that the body moves away from (6,2).\n\nFor example, if I continue moving, eventually the segment at (6,2) will move.\n\nBut it might take time.\n\nThe segment at (6,2) is part of the body, and as the snake moves, it will shift.\n\nFor instance, if I move the head to (4,1) on turn 48, then new head (4,1), no food, so tail moves, so the tail at (6,1) moves away, and the body shifts.\n\nAfter moving to (4,1) from (4,2), no food, so new head (4,1), then body (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), and tail (6,1) removed, so new positions: [ (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2) ] tail at (6,2).\n\nNow (6,2) is the tail, and it has food under it? The food is at (6,2), and now the tail is there.\n\nBut the food can be eaten only if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nNow the tail is at (6,2), so if the tail moves away, then the cell is free, and head can move to it.\n\nBut tail moves when no food eaten.\n\nSo if I move the head, and no food, tail moves, so (6,2) is vacated, then food is exposed, and I can move head to it.\n\nBut there is a danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it causes collision.\n\nCurrently, after turn 48, head at (4,1), tail at (6,2), not adjacent.\n\nIf I move to vacate (6,2).\n\nFor example, on turn 49, from (4,1), I can move, say, right to (5,1), or up to (4,2), but (4,2) is body, occupied, invalid, or left to (3,1), or down to (4,0) but y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nDirection at (4,1) is down, since moved down to (4,1).\n\nFrom (4,1), possible moves: down to (4,0) but y=0 wall, invalid; left to (3,1); right to (5,1); up to (4,2) but (4,2) is body, occupied, invalid.\n\nSo can go left to (3,1) or right to (5,1).\n\nSay I move right to (5,1).\n\nThen new head (5,1), no food, so tail moves: new positions head (5,1), then body (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), and tail (6,2) removed, so new tail at (6,3).\n\nNow, (6,2) is vacated, and food is there, so it can be eaten.\n\nHead at (5,1), which is not adjacent to (6,2). (5,1) to (6,2) is diagonal, not adjacent; adjacent means same row or column, adjacent cells.\n\n(5,1) and (6,2) are not adjacent; (6,2) is right and up from (5,1).\n\nAdjacent cells: from (5,1), adjacent are (5,2), (4,1), (6,1), (5,0) but walls.\n\n(6,2) is not adjacent to (5,1).\n\nSo to eat food at (6,2), I need to move head to (6,2) from an adjacent cell.\n\nPossible from (5,2), (6,1), (6,3), or (7,2) but x=7 wall.\n\n(6,1) is not free, in positions, (6,1) was removed, but in new positions, after moving to (5,1), positions: head (5,1), body (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3) tail.\n\nSo free cells: (5,2), (6,2), etc.\n\n(6,2) is free now, food is there.\n\nTo move head to (6,2), from current head at (5,1), I can go to (5,2) or (6,1) but (6,1) is not occupied? (6,1) is not in positions, so free.\n\nFrom (5,1), move up to (5,2), or right to (6,1), or left to (4,1) but occupied, down to (5,0) wall.\n\nSo can go up to (5,2) or right to (6,1).\n\nIf I go to (5,2), then from there to (6,2) or (4,2) etc.\n\nBut (6,2) is adjacent to (5,2).\n\nSimilarly, from (6,1) to (6,2).\n\nBut let's not digress.\n\nBack to turn 46.\n\nI think for short-term, eating the food at (4,2) is good, since it's positive and close.\n\nThen I can later eat the one at (6,2).\n\nThe one at (1,3) is also available, but far.\n\nLife span of (4,2) is short, only 4 turns, so I should eat it within the next 3 turns or so.\n\nAt turn 46, if I don't eat it soon, it might disappear.\n\nFor example, if I move down to (5,2) at turn 46, then on turn 47 I can eat at (4,2), so it's eaten on turn 47, before turn 50.\n\nSimilarly, if I move left to (4,3) on turn 46, then eat on turn 47.\n\nSo both ways, I can eat it on turn 47.\n\nThe difference is the position after.\n\nIf I move left to (4,3) on turn 46, then to (4,2) on turn 47, head at (4,2).\n\nIf I move down to (5,2) on turn 46, then to (4,2) on turn 47, head at (4,2) from a different direction.\n\nBut the resulting position is similar, but the body configuration might be slightly different.\n\nIn the first case, when I move left to (4,3), then down to (4,2), the body has (5,3) etc.\n\nIn the second case, move down to (5,2), then left to (4,2), body has (5,2) etc.\n\nBut both end with head at (4,2) and snake grown.\n\nThen from there, I can plan to eat the food at (6,2).\n\nTo eat (6,2), I need to vacate it first.\n\nCurrently, it's occupied, and in the body.\n\nAfter eating at (4,2), (6,2) is still occupied, as we saw.\n\nI need to move the snake so that the segment at (6,2) moves.\n\nSince the snake is long, it might take several moves.\n\nThe position of (6,2) in the body: after eating at (4,2), positions: head (4,2), body (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) tail.\n\n(6,2) is the second last segment, index 10 or something, so when the tail moves, it will be the last to move.\n\nTo vacate (6,2), I need the tail to move, which happens when no food is eaten, so after a few moves without eating, the tail will move, and (6,2) will be free.\n\nThen I can eat it.\n\nBut there is the tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it kills.\n\nSo when the tail is at (6,2) with food, and if head is adjacent, I should not eat it directly.\n\nBut in this case, after vacating, the food is exposed, and tail is elsewhere.\n\nFor example, suppose after eating at (4,2), I move the head around without eating, so tail moves.\n\nAfter a few moves, the segment that was at (6,2) will move to a different position, and (6,2) will be free.\n\nThen I can move head to (6,2) to eat.\n\nSince the food is there, and it's positive.\n\nLife span is 7, so by turn 53, I have time.\n\nSimilarly, for (1,3), life span 10.\n\nBut let's plan a sequence.\n\nI think for turn 46, I can choose to move left to (4,3) to set up for eating (4,2) next turn.\n\nOr move down to (5,2).\n\nMoving left might be better because it gets me closer to the left side, where (1,3) is, but not directly.\n\n(4,3) is x=4, (1,3) is x=1, so I need to go left.\n\nBut there might be obstacles.\n\nThe grid has no other obstacles except (4,6), so I can go to (1,3).\n\nBut let's think about the internal obstacle.\n\n(4,6) is at top, might not affect immediately.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the long-term path.\n\nSince the snake is long, I need to avoid boxing myself in.\n\nThe current snake position has a loop, so I need to be careful not to trap myself.\n\nFor example, from (4,2), I can move down to (4,1), or left to (3,2), etc.\n\nBut let's output a sequence.\n\nI think for now, I'll go for eating (4,2) first.\n\nSo at turn 46, move left to (4,3).\n\nThen on turn 47, move down to (4,2) to eat.\n\nThen from there, I need to move to vacate (6,2) or go elsewhere.\n\nBut let's think 5 turns ahead.\n\nTurn 46: move L to (4,3)\n\nTurn 47: move D to (4,2) eat food, now length 12, head at (4,2), direction D.\n\nThen turn 48: from (4,2), I can move D to (4,1), or L to (3,2), or R to (5,2).\n\nI need to choose a move that helps to free (6,2) or go towards other food.\n\nSince (6,2) is on the right, moving right might be better.\n\nBut let's see the tail position; tail is at (6,1).\n\nIf I move to (5,2) on turn 48, for example.\n\nTurn 48: move R to (5,2)\n\nThen new head (5,2), no food, so tail moves: new positions head (5,2), body (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), and tail (6,1) removed, so new tail at (6,2).\n\nPositions: after moving to (5,2) from (4,2), no eat, so new head (5,2), then body (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), and old tail (6,1) removed, so positions: [ (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2) ] tail at (6,2).\n\nNow (6,2) is tail, and it has food under it.\n\nThe food is at (6,2), and tail is there.\n\nTo eat it, I need to move the tail away.\n\nIf I move the head, and no food eaten, tail moves, so (6,2) is vacated.\n\nBut if head is adjacent to tail, and I eat the food when head moves to tail position, it might be dangerous.\n\nRule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nSo if head moves to the tail cell to eat the food, and if head was adjacent to tail before moving, then after eating, the new tail is at the previous tail position, but since head was adjacent, after moving, the new head is at food cell, new body at previous head, and new tail at previous tail, but since they were adjacent, the new head and new tail are adjacent, and since the new tail doesn't move immediately, it might cause collision? Let's see.\n\nSuppose head at H, tail at T, and T has food.\n\nIf H is adjacent to T, and I move H to T, then:\n\n- Head moves to T, eats food, so snake grows: new head at T, new body at H, and tail remains at T, but T is where the head moved to, so new head at T, new body at H, and the old tail was at T, but since food eaten, tail doesn't move, so the new tail is still at T, but T is now the head, so there is a body segment at H, and head at T, and tail at T? Confusion.\n\nPositions: before move, head at H, tail at T, with food at T.\n\nHead moves to T, eats food.\n\nNew positions: new head at T, then the previous head H becomes the first body segment, then the rest of the body to the previous tail T, but since tail didn't move, the previous tail T is still there, so new positions: head at T, body1 at H, body2 at previous body1, ..., bodyk at previous bodyk-1, and bodyk+1 at previous tail T.\n\nBut the previous tail was at T, so now there is a body segment at T, and head at T, same cell? Impossible.\n\nMistake.\n\nWhen head moves to a food cell, the head occupies the food cell, and the tail does not move, so the snake gains one segment: the new head is at the food cell, the previous head becomes the first body segment, and the body segments remain, and the tail remains at its position.\n\nBut if the food cell is the tail cell, then when head moves to tail, it is moving to the tail position.\n\nBut the tail position is occupied by the tail segment.\n\nIf head moves to the tail position, and tail has food, it eats it, and since tail doesn't move, the new head is at the tail position, and the previous head becomes body, and the tail remains, so now there is a body segment at the previous tail position? Let's think.\n\nBefore move: positions: ..., H (head), ..., T (tail)\n\nFood at T.\n\nHead moves to T, eats food.\n\nNew head at T.\n\nThen the previous head H becomes the first body segment.\n\nThen the body segments between H and T remain the same.\n\nThen the tail T remains at T.\n\nBut now new head at T, and tail at T, same cell, which is collision immediately.\n\nYes, that's the danger.\n\nIf the food is at the tail cell, and head moves to it, since head and tail are at the same cell after eating, it dies.\n\nBut in the rule, it says \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills\", which implies that when head moves to the tail cell, it causes collision because the head and the new tail (which is at the same position) collide.\n\nAfter eating, the tail remains, so head and tail at same cell.\n\nSo to avoid, if the tail has food, I should not move head to it directly if head is adjacent; I need to move so that the tail moves away first, then eat.\n\nIn the case where tail is at food cell, I should not eat it when head is adjacent; I should move to vacate the cell first.\n\nIn our earlier state, when tail is at (6,2) with food, and head is not adjacent, I can move the head elsewhere, so that tail moves, vacating (6,2), then later head can move to (6,2) to eat.\n\nSince head is not adjacent, no danger.\n\nIn the position after turn 48, with head at (5,2) and tail at (6,2), they are adjacent? (5,2) and (6,2) are adjacent horizontally.\n\nSo if head is at (5,2) and tail at (6,2) with food, and I move head to (6,2), it would cause collision because after eating, head and tail at same cell.\n\nSo I should not do that.\n\nInstead, I should move head away, so tail moves, vacating (6,2), then later come back to eat.\n\nFor example, from (5,2), I can move to (5,1) or (4,2) or (6,2) but not to (6,2) directly because of danger.\n\nMove to (5,1), for example.\n\nThen tail moves, (6,2) vacated.\n\nThen from there, I can move to (6,2) if possible.\n\nBut let's not get into details.\n\nBack to turn 46 decision.\n\nI think moving left to (4,3) at turn 46 is fine, then down to (4,2) at turn 47.\n\nThen from there, I can move to free (6,2).\n\nSince (1,3) is far, I can go for it later.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to provide a sequence.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns: turns 46 to 50 or something.\n\nTurn 46: move L to (4,3)\n\nTurn 47: move D to (4,2) eat food\n\nThen turn 48: from (4,2), move R to (5,2)  (since moving right might help for (6,2))\n\nThen turn 49: from (5,2), I need to move to vacate (6,2), but tail is at (6,1) or something.\n\nAfter turn 47: head at (4,2), positions: [ (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) ] tail (6,1)\n\nTurn 48: move R to (5,2)\n\n(5,2) is free, no food, so new head (5,2), then body (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), tail (6,1) removed, so new positions: [ (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2) ] tail at (6,2)\n\nNow (6,2) is tail with food.\n\nHead at (5,2), adjacent to tail at (6,2).\n\nIf I move to (6,2), danger.\n\nSo I should move to (5,1) or (4,2) but (4,2) is body, occupied, invalid.\n\nFrom (5,2), direction right (since moved right), so can move right to (6,2) but dangerous, down to (5,1), left to (4,2) occupied, up to (5,3) occupied.\n\nSo only down to (5,1) or right to (6,2) but not safe.\n\nMove down to (5,1).\n\nTurn 49: move D to (5,1)\n\nNew head (5,1), no food, so tail moves: new positions head (5,1), body (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), and tail (6,2) removed, so (6,2) vacated, food exposed.\n\nNew tail at (6,3).\n\nHead at (5,1), not adjacent to (6,2).\n\nThen I can move to eat (6,2).\n\nFrom (5,1), I can move up to (5,2) or right to (6,1) or left to (4,1).\n\n(6,1) is free, no food.\n\nTo go to (6,2), from (5,1), I can go to (5,2) first, then to (6,2).\n\nOr directly, but (5,1) to (6,2) not adjacent.\n\nTurn 50: from (5,1), move to (5,2) or (6,1).\n\nSay move U to (5,2)\n\nThen head at (5,2), which is free.\n\nThen from (5,2), I can move to (6,2) to eat.\n\nBut (6,2) has food, and head at (5,2) adjacent to (6,2).\n\nIf I move to (6,2), since head is adjacent to the food cell, but the food cell is not the tail cell now, tail is at (6,3), so no danger.\n\nTail is at (6,3), food at (6,2), so moving to (6,2) is safe to eat.\n\nSimilarly, I could have moved directly to (6,2) from (5,1) if possible, but not adjacent.\n\nSo from (5,1), move U to (5,2) on turn 50, then on turn 51 move R to (6,2) to eat.\n\nBut for the sequence, I can provide up to turn 50 or so.\n\nSince the answer format is for a sequence, I'll provide for turns 46 to 50.\n\nAt turn 46, move left to (4,3)\n\nTurn 47, move down to (4,2) eat\n\nTurn 48, move right to (5,2)\n\nTurn 49, move down to (5,1) to avoid danger and vacate\n\nTurn 50, move up to (5,2) to prepare for eating (6,2)\n\nThen on turn 51, I can move right to (6,2) to eat.\n\nBut for now, up to turn 50.\n\nIn this sequence, on turn 50, I move to (5,2), which is fine.\n\nBut let's check if all moves are valid.\n\nTurn 46: from (5,3) direction D, move L to (4,3), valid.\n\nTurn 47: from (4,3) direction L? After moving left, direction is L, so from (4,3), move D to (4,2), valid.\n\nTurn 48: from (4,2) direction D, move R to (5,2), valid.\n\nTurn 49: from (5,2) direction R, move D to (5,1), valid, since (5,1) free.\n\nTurn 50: from (5,1) direction D, move U to (5,2), but moving up is reverse? Direction is D, moving U is opposite, so instant reverse, not allowed.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt turn 49, I moved down to (5,1), so direction is down.\n\nThen at turn 50, from (5,1), direction D, I cannot move up to (5,2) because it's reverse.\n\nPossible moves: down to (5,0) wall, invalid; left to (4,1); right to (6,1); up to (5,2) but reverse, invalid.\n\nSo can only move left to (4,1) or right to (6,1).\n\nCannot move up.\n\nSo in my sequence, I cannot move to (5,2) on turn 50.\n\nI need to adjust.\n\nFrom (5,1) on turn 50, I can move to (6,1) or (4,1).\n\nThen from there, I can go to (6,2) later.\n\nFor example, move to (6,1), then to (6,2).\n\n(6,1) is free.\n\nTurn 50: move R to (6,1)\n\nThen head at (6,1), no food, so tail moves, etc.\n\nThen turn 51: from (6,1), move U to (6,2) to eat.\n\nBut let's not extend.\n\nFor the sequence, I can provide turns 46 to 50 as:\n\nTurn 46: L\n\nTurn 47: D\n\nTurn 48: R\n\nTurn 49: D\n\nTurn 50: R to (6,1)\n\nThen it sets up for eating (6,2) on turn 51.\n\nSimilarly, I could have moved left to (4,1) but (6,2) is on right, so moving right is better.\n\nAt turn 46, if I moved down to (5,2) instead.\n\nTurn 46: move D to (5,2)\n\nThen turn 47: move L to (4,2) eat\n\nThen head at (4,2), direction L (since moved left).\n\nThen turn 48: from (4,2), move D to (4,1), or L to (3,2), or R to (5,2) but (5,2) might be occupied or not.\n\nAfter eating at (4,2) from (5,2), positions: head (4,2), body (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) tail.\n\nSo (5,2) is body.\n\nFrom (4,2), direction L, can move L to (3,2), D to (4,1), or U to (4,3) but (4,3) not in positions? In this case, (4,3) is not occupied, but in positions, after eating, body is (5,2), (5,3), etc., no (4,3), so (4,3) is free.\n\nPositions: head (4,2), body (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) tail.\n\nSo (4,3) is free.\n\nFrom (4,2), direction L, so can move L to (3,2), D to (4,1), U to (4,3), or R to (5,2) but (5,2) occupied, invalid.\n\nSo can go U, D, or L.\n\nThen I can move to (4,3) or (3,2) or (4,1).\n\nBut to go towards (6,2), moving up or down might not help directly.\n\nI think the first approach is fine.\n\nSo for the answer, I'll go with:\n\nTurn 46: L (to (4,3))\n\nTurn 47: D (to (4,2) eat)\n\nTurn 48: R (to (5,2))\n\nTurn 49: D (to (5,1))\n\nThen for turn 50, from (5,1) direction D, move R to (6,1)\n\nThen later to (6,2).\n\nBut for 5 turns, up to turn 50.\n\nTurn 50: R\n\nThen the sequence is L, D, R, D, R for turns 46 to 50.\n\nBut let's confirm the directions.\n\nTurn 46: from (5,3) dir D, move L, new dir L\n\nTurn 47: from (4,3) dir L, move D, new dir D\n\nTurn 48: from (4,2) dir D, move R, new dir R\n\nTurn 49: from (5,2) dir R, move D, new dir D\n\nTurn 50: from (5,1) dir D, move R to (6,1), new dir R\n\nAll valid moves.\n\nThen on turn 51, from (6,1) dir R, move U to (6,2) to eat, etc.\n\nBut for now, this should be fine.\n\nI could include eating (6,2) in the sequence, but life span is 7, so up to turn 53, I have time.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) can be targeted later.\n\nSo for the answer, I'll provide 5 moves.\n</think>\nTo maximize the long-term score while prioritizing survival, the strategy involves eating the positive food at (4,2) immediately due to its short life span (disappears at turn 50), then positioning to eat the food at (6,2) after vacating it, and finally heading towards the food at (1,3) for future consumption. The sequence below is planned for 5 turns (turns 46 to 50) to ensure safe movement, avoid collisions, and set up for eating (6,2) on turn 51.\n\n### Key Considerations for the Sequence:\n- **Turn 46 (current turn)**: The snake head is at (5,3) with direction down. Moving left to (4,3) avoids the body at (6,3) and positions closer to (4,2) for eating next turn. Moving down to (5,2) is also possible but less efficient for accessing (4,2).\n- **Turn 47**: Move down to (4,2) to eat the positive food (+1 score, snake length increases to 12). This must be done by turn 47 to avoid the food disappearing (life span 4 at turn 46).\n- **Turn 48**: Move right to (5,2) to begin shifting the snake body and prepare for accessing the right side where (6,2) is located.\n- **Turn 49**: Move down to (5,1) to vacate the (6,2) cell (which has food under the body) and avoid the tail reward danger, as the tail is at (6,2) after this move. This step is safe and ensures (6,2) is exposed.\n- **Turn 50**: Move right to (6,1) to position for eating (6,2) on turn 51. Moving right is chosen over left to stay near (6,2) and because (6,1) is free. The food at (6,2) has a life span of 7 (disappears at turn 53), so eating on turn 51 is feasible.\n- **Beyond Turn 50**: On turn 51, move up to (6,2) to eat the food (life span allows this). Then, head towards (1,3) (life span 10, disappears at turn 56) by moving left through the bottom rows to avoid obstacles and body collisions.\n\n### Action Sequence (Turns 46 to 50):\n\\boxed{\nTurn 46: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 47: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 48: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 49: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 50: R (right)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 47, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates go from (0,0) to (7,7). There's an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (4,3), then body segments: (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1). So the tail is at (6,1). The head direction is L, which means left, so it was moving left last turn.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (4,2) with life span 3 and value 1 (positive)\n\n- (6,2) with life span 6 and value 1 (positive)\n\n- (1,3) with life span 9 and value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive here, no negative food mentioned.\n\nNow, I need to choose actions for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead. Prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls are the borders, so I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, internal obstacle at (4,6), so that cell is blocked.\n\nSnake body: let's list all positions to avoid collisions.\n\nHead: (4,3)\n\nBody: (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)\n\nTail is at (6,1).\n\nSince the snake is moving, the tail will move when the head moves, unless it eats food.\n\nFood:\n\n- (4,2): life span 3, so it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 47, life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 49? Let's clarify.\n\nLife span N means it disappears after N turns, and countdown decreases each turn including current. So at turn t, if life span is L, it will be gone after turn t + L - 1? No.\n\nStandard: if at turn t, life span is N, then:\n\n- On turn t, life span N\n\n- On turn t+1, life span N-1\n\n- ...\n\n- On turn t + N - 1, life span 1\n\n- After that, it disappears, so not available on turn t + N.\n\nFor food at (4,2), life span 3 at turn 47:\n\n- Turn 47: life span 3\n\n- Turn 48: life span 2\n\n- Turn 49: life span 1\n\n- Turn 50: gone\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\n(6,2) life span 6 at turn 47:\n\n- Gone after turn 47 + 6 - 1 = turn 52? Let's not calculate yet.\n\n(1,3) life span 9, so it will last a while.\n\nHead direction is L, so last move was left. Therefore, I cannot instantly reverse to R (right) on the next move, because of the no instant reverse rule. So possible moves from (4,3) are U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), but since it was moving left, moving right (R) is not allowed.\n\nCurrent head position: (4,3)\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: to (4,4) but (4,4) is occupied by body? Let's see the snake positions.\n\nSnake positions: [(4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)]\n\nSo (4,4) is the fourth segment, so it's a body cell. Moving to (4,4) would cause collision because head touches body, except for the tail under certain conditions.\n\nCollision rules: head touches any body segment except that when moving into the tail cell, it might be ok if the tail moves away.\n\nSpecifically, you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment because the tail will move forward, so after the move, that cell is free, but during the move, if head moves to tail position, it's not collision because tail moves.\n\nBut in this case, for move to (4,4), (4,4) is not the tail; tail is at (6,1). So (4,4) is a body segment, so moving to (4,4) would cause collision and death.\n\nSimilarly, let's list all occupied cells by snake: (4,3) is head, but when we move, the head leaves that cell, and the body follows.\n\nBut for collision, when head moves to a new cell, if that cell is occupied by any body segment except the current tail (because tail moves), then it collides.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, only the tail cell is safe to move into, because after moving, the tail is no longer there.\n\nIn this snake, tail is at (6,1), and it's the last segment.\n\nSo for head at (4,3), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (4,4) — (4,4) is occupied by a body segment (the fourth position), not tail, so collision.\n\n- D: to (4,2) — (4,2) is a food position, but we need to check if it's occupied. Food is at (4,2), but is it under the snake? Snake positions are given, (4,2) is not in the snake positions list; snake is at (4,3), (5,3), etc., not (4,2). So (4,2) is free? Let's see.\n\nSnake positions: (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)\n\n(4,2) is not listed, so it should be free, and there's food there.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) has food, but (6,2) is occupied by the snake? (6,2) is in the positions: it's the tenth position, so it's a body segment.\n\nLet's index: positions: 0: head (4,3), 1: (5,3), 2: (5,4), 3: (4,4), 4: (4,5), 5: (5,5), 6: (6,5), 7: (6,4), 8: (6,3), 9: (6,2), 10: tail (6,1)\n\nSo (6,2) is segment 9, not tail. Tail is (6,1).\n\nSo (6,2) is occupied by body.\n\nNow, back to moves from head (4,3):\n\n- U: to (4,4) — (4,4) is segment 3, body, collision.\n\n- D: to (4,2) — (4,2) is not occupied by snake; it has food, but we can move there. Since it's not under snake body, we can eat it directly.\n\n- L: to (3,3) — x=3,y=3. Is this within bounds? x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. (3,3) should be free? Snake positions: (3,3) not listed, walls not at (3,3), obstacle at (4,6) not affecting. So (3,3) seems free.\n\n- R: to (5,3) — (5,3) is segment 1, body, collision. Cannot move right because it's instant reverse? Head direction is L, so moving R is opposite direction, which is not allowed. No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nCurrent head direction is L, meaning last move was left, so next move cannot be R (right), because that would be instant reverse.\n\nSo possible moves: U, D, L. R is not allowed due to instant reverse rule.\n\nBut U to (4,4) is collision, as (4,4) is body.\n\nD to (4,2) is possible, and has food.\n\nL to (3,3) is possible, empty.\n\nSo only two options: D or L.\n\nD to (4,2): eat positive food, snake grows, so length increases by one.\n\nL to (3,3): no food, just move.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nFirst, if I go D to (4,2), I eat the food at (4,2), which has life span 3, so it will disappear soon anyway. By eating it, I get +1 score and grow.\n\nAfter eating, new head at (4,2), and the tail doesn't move, so snake grows: positions become [(4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)] — I added (4,2) as new head, and the body follows, so the tail is still at (6,1), but since we ate, tail doesn't move, so length increases by one.\n\nOriginal positions: 11 segments.\n\nAfter eating: head moves to (4,2), then body: old head (4,3) becomes first body, then (5,3), etc., up to (6,1) still there, and since we ate, we add a new segment where the tail was? No.\n\nStandard snake movement: when snake moves without eating, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the next position, tail leaves its cell.\n\nWhen eating, head moves to new cell (with food), and a new segment is added at the previous tail position, so the tail doesn't move; it stays, and a new segment is added there? No.\n\nClarify: when snake eats, after moving, the head is on the food cell, and the tail remains where it was, so the snake grows by one segment. The new segment is added at the end, so the tail position doesn't change immediately; instead, the snake becomes longer.\n\nFor example, if tail was at P, and head moves to food, then the new tail is still at P, and the snake has an extra segment.\n\nIn terms of positions: before move, positions [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nAfter move without eating: [newH, H, B1, B2, ..., B_{n-1}] and T is removed.\n\nAfter move with eating: [newH, H, B1, B2, ..., T] and a new segment is added at the position where T was? No.\n\nTypically: after eating, the head moves to the food cell, the body follows, but the tail doesn't advance; it stays, so the snake gains a segment. So positions: [new_head, old_head, B1, B2, ..., old_tail] — old_tail remains, so it's one longer.\n\nIn this case, from [ (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) ]\n\nIf head moves to (4,2) and eats, new positions: head at (4,2), then old head (4,3) becomes first body, then (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), and tail (6,1) remains as tail, so positions: [(4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)] — that's 12 positions, with tail at (6,1). (6,2) is now second last, (6,1) tail.\n\nIn the list, (6,2) was segment 9, now it's segment 10 or something. Positions: index 0: (4,2) head, 1: (4,3), 2: (5,3), 3: (5,4), 4: (4,4), 5: (4,5), 6: (5,5), 7: (6,5), 8: (6,4), 9: (6,3), 10: (6,2), 11: (6,1) tail.\n\nYes, tail at (6,1).\n\nNow, if I don't eat, say move L to (3,3), no food, so positions: head to (3,3), then body: (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), and tail (6,1) moves off, so tail is now (6,2)? Let's see: after move, head at (3,3), then first body is old head (4,3), then (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), and tail was (6,1), but since no eat, tail moves to (6,2)? No.\n\nWithout eating: head moves to new position, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the last segment (tail) is removed.\n\nSo positions: before move: [H, B1, B2, ..., Bk, T]\n\nAfter move to new cell: [newH, H, B1, B2, ..., Bk] and T is gone.\n\nIn this case, segments: let's number: S0: (4,3) head, S1: (5,3), S2: (5,4), S3: (4,4), S4: (4,5), S5: (5,5), S6: (6,5), S7: (6,4), S8: (6,3), S9: (6,2), S10: (6,1) tail.\n\nAfter move to (3,3) without eating: new head at (3,3), then S0 moves to S1 position? No: the new head is at (3,3), then the first body segment is the old head position (4,3), which was S0, then S1 becomes new position for what was S1, but it's shifted.\n\nStandard: after moving to a new cell without eating, the new positions are: [new_head, old_head, S1, S2, ..., S_{n-2}] where S_{n-1} is tail and is removed.\n\nHere, n=11 segments, S0 to S10, S10 tail.\n\nAfter move to (3,3): new_head = (3,3), then body: old_head (4,3), then S1 (5,3), S2 (5,4), S3 (4,4), S4 (4,5), S5 (5,5), S6 (6,5), S7 (6,4), S8 (6,3), S9 (6,2). S10 (6,1) is removed, so it's gone. Tail is now at S9 position, which is (6,2).\n\nPositions: [(3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)] with tail at (6,2).\n\nYes.\n\nNow back to decision.\n\nAt turn 47, head at (4,3), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: D to (4,2) or L to (3,3).\n\nIf I go D to (4,2), I eat food, grow, score +1.\n\nIf I go L to (3,3), no eat.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nAlso, there is food at (4,2) which will disappear soon, life span 3, so if I don't eat it now, it might be gone in a few turns.\n\nSimilarly, other food.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nFirst, let's list all forbidden cells: walls and obstacles.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells like (0,y) for all y, (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) are walls.\n\nInternal obstacle: (4,6)\n\nAlso, snake body cells are occupied, but they move.\n\nFor collision, we care about the cells after move.\n\nNow, for turn 47, if I move D to (4,2), I eat and grow.\n\nThen head at (4,2), direction now D (since I moved down).\n\nThen next moves.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (6,2). (6,2) has food, but (6,2) is currently occupied by the snake body, segment S9.\n\nFood can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it later.\n\nHere, food at (6,2) is on a body cell, so to eat it, the snake must move so that the body leaves (6,2), and then head moves to (6,2) when it's free.\n\nSimilarly, food at (4,2) is free now, so I can eat it directly.\n\nFood at (1,3) is also free.\n\nNow, (6,2) is occupied, so I can't eat it now.\n\nLife span: (4,2) has life 3, so if not eaten by turn 49, it's gone.\n\n(6,2) has life 6, so more time.\n\n(1,3) has life 9, plenty of time.\n\nBut (6,2) is under body, so I need to free that cell first.\n\nCurrently, at turn 47, (6,2) is occupied by S9.\n\nWhen the snake moves, if no eat, the tail moves, so cells are freed.\n\nFor example, if I don't eat at turn 47, and move, tail moves, so (6,1) is freed, but (6,2) is still occupied by S9, which becomes the new tail or something.\n\nAfter move without eat, the tail position is freed.\n\nIn the case where I move L to (3,3) without eating, positions become: head (3,3), then (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2) with tail at (6,2).\n\nSo (6,1) is freed, but (6,2) is now occupied by the tail.\n\nFood at (6,2) is under the tail now? At turn 47, food is at (6,2), and snake is at (6,2), so it's occupied.\n\nAfter move to (3,3) without eat, the cell (6,2) is still occupied, now by the tail.\n\nTo eat the food at (6,2), I need the head to move to (6,2) when it's free, but currently it's occupied.\n\nThe body needs to move away so that (6,2) is empty, then head can move there.\n\nSince it's the tail, when the snake moves and doesn't eat, the tail moves, so if (6,2) is tail, and I move without eating, the tail leaves (6,2), freeing it, and if there's food, it can be eaten later.\n\nIn this case, after moving to (3,3) at turn 47, positions: tail at (6,2), so (6,2) is occupied.\n\nThen at turn 48, if I move without eating, the tail will move from (6,2), freeing it for the next turn or something.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\nAt turn 47, before move: (6,2) occupied by S9, not tail.\n\nAfter move to (3,3) without eat: tail is at (6,2), so (6,2) occupied.\n\nAt turn 48, if I move without eating, head moves to some cell, say, and the tail (6,2) is removed, so (6,2) becomes free at the end of the turn.\n\nThen at turn 49, if head moves to (6,2), I can eat the food.\n\nBut the food at (6,2) has life span decreasing.\n\nAt turn 47, life span 6 for (6,2).\n\nTurn 47: life span 6\n\nTurn 48: life span 5\n\nTurn 49: life span 4\n\netc.\n\nSo on turn 49, if (6,2) is free and head moves there, I can eat.\n\nBut I need to plan the path.\n\nSimilarly for other food.\n\nNow, back to turn 47 choice.\n\nOption 1: Move D to (4,2), eat food.\n\nThen head at (4,2), direction D (down).\n\nSnake positions: as above, 12 segments: head (4,2), then (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) tail.\n\nFood at (4,2) is eaten, so removed.\n\nOther food: (6,2) still there, but occupied by snake? (6,2) is now segment 10, not tail; tail is (6,1). So (6,2) occupied by body.\n\n(1,3) free.\n\nFrom head (4,2), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: since moved down, cannot move up (U) next, because instant reverse? No, instant reverse means opposite direction.\n\nCurrent direction after move is D, so cannot move U on next turn.\n\nPossible moves from (4,2): U, D, L, R, but D is down to (4,1), but y=1, y=0 is wall, so (4,1) is within bounds? y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 to y=6 are free, but (4,1) is not wall, not occupied? Snake positions: (4,1) not listed, so free.\n\nBut moving D to (4,1): down to (4,1).\n\nU to (4,3): but (4,3) is now body segment, occupied.\n\nL to (3,2)\n\nR to (5,2)\n\nNow, direction is D, so moving U is opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo possible moves: D, L, R.\n\n- D to (4,1): free? Let's check.\n\n- L to (3,2): free?\n\n- R to (5,2): free?\n\nNow, snake positions: head (4,2), body: (4,3), (5,3), etc. to (6,1)\n\n(4,1) not occupied, should be free.\n\n(3,2) not occupied.\n\n(5,2) not occupied.\n\nAlso, walls: no.\n\nBut (4,1) is above y=0, but y=0 is wall, y=1 is not wall.\n\ny=0 is wall, so (x,0) for all x is wall, but (x,1) is not wall unless specified.\n\nSimilarly, internal obstacle (4,6), not affecting.\n\nSo all three moves possible.\n\nBut I need to think further.\n\nIf I go D to (4,1), then I'm near the bottom wall.\n\nBut let's see the food at (6,2). It's occupied, so I need to free it.\n\nCurrently (6,2) is occupied by segment 10.\n\nIf I don't eat for a few turns, the tail will move, freeing cells.\n\nBut after eating at turn 47, snake is longer, so it takes more moves to free the tail area.\n\nAt turn 47 after eating, tail is at (6,1), and (6,2) is occupied.\n\nTo free (6,2), I need the snake to move without eating for some turns so that the segment at (6,2) moves away.\n\nSince the snake is long, it might be inefficient.\n\nOption 2 at turn 47: move L to (3,3) without eating.\n\nThen positions: head at (3,3), body: (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2) tail at (6,2).\n\nDirection: I moved left, so direction L.\n\nFood at (4,2) is still there, life span now 2 (since turn 48, life span decreases).\n\nAt turn 47, after move, it's turn 48? Let's clarify the turn timing.\n\nAt the start of turn 47, I make a move.\n\nAfter the move, it's the end of turn 47, and life span decreases.\n\nState is given at turn 47 before move.\n\nAfter I move, for food, life span decreases.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nThe description: \"Current Turn: t1 = 47\" and food has life span, so at turn 47, life span is given, and after each turn, including after turn 47 action, life span decreases.\n\nSo for food at (4,2), life span 3 at turn 47.\n\nAfter turn 47 action, at turn 48, life span becomes 2.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIf I move to (4,2) at turn 47, I eat it, so it's consumed.\n\nIf I don't, at turn 48, life span 2.\n\nBack to option 2: move L to (3,3) at turn 47.\n\nThen after move, positions: head (3,3), body (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2) tail.\n\nDirection L.\n\nFood: (4,2) life span now 2 (at turn 48), (6,2) life span 5 (since decreased from 6 to 5), (1,3) life span 8.\n\n(6,2) is now the tail position, occupied.\n\nAt turn 48, from head (3,3), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot move R (right) because instant reverse, direction is L, so cannot move R.\n\nU to (3,4): is it free? (3,4) not in snake positions, not wall, so free.\n\nD to (3,2): free? (3,2) not occupied.\n\nL to (2,3): free.\n\nR to (4,3): but (4,3) is body segment, occupied, collision.\n\nAlso, moving R is instant reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo possible: U, D, L.\n\n- U to (3,4)\n\n- D to (3,2)\n\n- L to (2,3)\n\nNow, food at (4,2) is at (4,2), which is adjacent to (3,2) and (4,3), but (4,3) is body, so I can move to (3,2) or (4,2) from there.\n\nFrom (3,3), D to (3,2) is down to (3,2), then from (3,2), I can move to (4,2) if possible.\n\n(4,2) has food with life span 2 at turn 48.\n\nAt turn 48, if I move to (3,2), then I can consider moving to (4,2) at turn 49.\n\nBut at turn 48, if I move to (3,2), no eat, positions update.\n\nLet's think about the tail food.\n\n(6,2) is tail at turn 47 end.\n\nAt turn 48, if I move without eating, the tail will move from (6,2), freeing it.\n\nFor example, from head (3,3), if I move, say, L to (2,3) at turn 48.\n\nThen positions: head to (2,3), body: old head (3,3), then (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), and tail was (6,2), but no eat, so tail moves to (6,3)? After move, new head (2,3), body: (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3) with tail at (6,3). (6,2) is freed.\n\nThen at turn 48, food at (6,2) is now free, and life span 5.\n\nThen I can eat it by moving to (6,2) from adjacent cells.\n\nBut head is at (2,3), far from (6,2).\n\nI need to plan a path.\n\nAlso, there is the food at (4,2) with short life.\n\nTo maximize score, I should eat (4,2) soon since it will disappear.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) can be eaten later.\n\nBut let's compare the two options for turn 47.\n\nFirst, if I eat (4,2) at turn 47, I get +1 now, but the snake is longer, making it harder to maneuver, and (6,2) is still occupied, so I need to free it later with a longer snake.\n\nIf I don't eat at turn 47, I can free (6,2) sooner and eat it, and also eat (4,2) if possible.\n\nAt turn 47, if I move L to (3,3), then at turn 48, I can move D to (3,2), then at turn 49, I can move R to (4,2) to eat the food, if it's still there.\n\nAt turn 48, after move to (3,2), life span of (4,2) decreases to 1, so at turn 49, if I move to (4,2), I can eat it before it disappears.\n\nLife span at turn 48: after turn 48 action, life span decreases, so at start of turn 48, life span 2 for (4,2), after turn 48 action, if not eaten, life span becomes 1 at turn 49, then after turn 49 action, if not eaten, it disappears.\n\nSo at turn 49, if I move to (4,2), I can eat it.\n\nNow, for (6,2), at turn 47 end, after move to (3,3), tail at (6,2).\n\nAt turn 48, if I move without eating, the tail moves, freeing (6,2).\n\nFor example, if at turn 48 I move to (3,2) from (3,3), then as above, (6,2) is freed at the end of turn 48.\n\nThen at turn 49, (6,2) is free with food, life span 4 (since turn 49).\n\nBut head is at (3,2) after turn 48, far from (6,2).\n\nI need to go to (6,2).\n\nBut at turn 49, I might be eating (4,2), so head at (4,2) if I go that path.\n\nLet's outline the path.\n\nOption: turn 47: L to (3,3)\n\nTurn 48: from (3,3), move D to (3,2)  -- no eat, positions: head (3,2), body (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3) tail at (6,3). (6,2) freed.\n\nFood at (6,2) now free.\n\nTurn 49: from (3,2), I can move to (4,2) to eat the food there, since life span 1, will disappear after this turn.\n\nMove R to (4,2), eat, so snake grows.\n\nNew positions: head (4,2), then (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3) and since ate, tail remains at (6,3), so positions: [(4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)] tail at (6,3).\n\nDirection after move R.\n\nFood at (6,2) is free, but I didn't move to it.\n\n(6,2) is adjacent to (6,3), which is tail.\n\nNow, from head (4,2), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot move L (left) because instant reverse from R.\n\nU to (4,3): (4,3) is body segment, occupied, collision.\n\nD to (4,1): free\n\nL to (3,2): but (3,2) is body segment, occupied, collision.\n\nR to (5,2): free? (5,2) not occupied.\n\nSo possible: D to (4,1) or R to (5,2).\n\nNow, (6,2) is free with food, but head is at (4,2), so I need to go right and down or something.\n\nBut I have the food at (6,2) which I can eat.\n\nLife span at turn 49: (6,2) life span was 5 at turn 48, after turn 48 decreased to 4 at turn 49? Let's track.\n\nAt turn 47 start: (6,2) life span 6\n\nAfter turn 47 action (move to (3,3)), turn 48: life span 5\n\nAfter turn 48 action (move to (3,2)), turn 49: life span 4\n\nAfter turn 49 action (move to (4,2) eat), turn 50: for (6,2), life span 3, still there.\n\nSo I can go to (6,2) later.\n\nBut from (4,2), I need to move to (5,2), then (6,2), for example.\n\nAt turn 50, from head (4,2), say I move R to (5,2) at turn 49? Turn 49 I am at (4,2) after move.\n\nTurn 49 action: I moved to (4,2), so at end of turn 49, head at (4,2).\n\nTurn 50: from (4,2), direction R (since I moved right to (4,2)? From (3,2) to (4,2) is right, so direction R.\n\nAt turn 50, from (4,2), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot move L (instant reverse).\n\nU to (4,3): body, collision.\n\nD to (4,1): free\n\nL to (3,2): body, collision\n\nR to (5,2): free\n\nSo only D or R.\n\nIf I move R to (5,2), no eat (assuming no food there), positions: head to (5,2), body: (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4) tail at (6,4)? After move without eat, tail was (6,3), removed.\n\nPositions before turn 50: head (4,2), body (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3) tail.\n\nAfter move to (5,2) without eat: new head (5,2), body: old head (4,2), then (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4) with tail at (6,4). (6,3) removed.\n\n(6,2) is free with food.\n\nFrom (5,2), I can move to (6,2) to eat.\n\nAt turn 50, from (5,2), direction R (since moved right from (4,2) to (5,2)? From (4,2) to (5,2) is right, so direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R, cannot move L.\n\nU to (5,3): (5,3) is body, occupied, collision? (5,3) is in positions, yes, body segment.\n\nD to (5,1): free\n\nL to (4,2): (4,2) is body, occupied, collision\n\nR to (6,2): (6,2) is free, has food, so I can move there and eat.\n\nMove R to (6,2), eat, grow.\n\nSo in this path, I ate two foods: (4,2) at turn 49 and (6,2) at turn 50.\n\nBut at turn 47 I didn't eat, so I missed the immediate reward but got both later.\n\nIn the first option, if I ate at turn 47, I have one food, and snake longer, and (6,2) still occupied, so harder to eat it.\n\nFor example, after eating at turn 47, snake 12 segments, tail at (6,1).\n\n(6,2) occupied.\n\nTo free (6,2), I need to move without eating for some turns.\n\nSuppose at turn 48, from (4,2) dir D, I move, say, R to (5,2) or D to (4,1), etc.\n\nBut it takes time to free the area.\n\nFor instance, the segment at (6,2) will only move when the snake moves, and since it's not tail, it takes many moves to free it.\n\nSpecifically, to free a particular cell, the snake needs to move so that the segment leaves, but with growth, it's slower.\n\nIn this case, without eating, cells are freed faster.\n\nSo the second option seems better: don't eat at turn 47, move left, then go to (3,2), then to (4,2) to eat at turn 49, then to (5,2), then to (6,2) to eat at turn 50.\n\nIn that path, I ate both foods.\n\nNow, what about the food at (1,3)? It's far, life span 9, so I can get it later.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid risks.\n\nIn the path above, when I move to (4,2) at turn 49, is there any danger?\n\nAt turn 49, after moving to (4,2), head at (4,2), and the tail is at (6,3), no immediate collision risk.\n\nThen to (5,2), then to (6,2).\n\nWhen I move to (6,2) at turn 50, (6,2) was free, no problem.\n\nBut note the special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn this case, when I eat at (6,2), is the head adjacent to the tail?\n\nAt turn 50, before move, head at (5,2), tail at (6,4) or something.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAfter turn 49 eat at (4,2), positions: head (4,2), tail at (6,3)\n\n(6,3) is tail.\n\nHead at (4,2), tail at (6,3), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (4,2) and (6,3) are not adjacent; differ in both x and y.\n\nThen at turn 50, I move to (5,2), no eat, so positions: head (5,2), body (4,2), etc., tail at (6,4)? After move to (5,2) without eat, tail was (6,3), removed, new tail at (6,4) or something.\n\nPositions before turn 50: head (4,2), body: (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3) tail.\n\nAfter move to (5,2) without eat: new head (5,2), body: old head (4,2), then (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4) with tail at (6,4).\n\n(6,3) removed.\n\nNow tail at (6,4).\n\nHead at (5,2).\n\nThen I move to (6,2) at turn 50? Turn 50 action: from (5,2) to (6,2), which is right.\n\n(6,2) has food, so I eat.\n\nAfter eating, new head at (6,2), body follows, and since ate, tail remains at (6,4), so new positions: head (6,2), then old head (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4) tail at (6,4).\n\nNow, head at (6,2), tail at (6,4). Are they adjacent? (6,2) and (6,4) differ by y=2, not adjacent; adjacent would be (6,3) or (5,2) etc., but (6,4) is two away, so no problem.\n\nThe tail cell is (6,4), not adjacent to head (6,2).\n\nSo no danger.\n\nMoreover, I have the food at (1,3) to consider later.\n\nBut for now, this path seems good.\n\nIf at turn 47 I ate immediately, I might not get (6,2) easily.\n\nFor example, after eating at turn 47, snake longer, and to free (6,2), I need to move without eating, but (6,2) is not tail, so it takes many moves.\n\nSuppose after turn 47 eat, head at (4,2) dir D.\n\nThen I need to move around to free the body.\n\nBut it might be inefficient.\n\nMoreover, the food at (4,2) is short-lived, so if I don't eat it soon, it's gone.\n\nIn the second option, I eat it at turn 49 just before it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, for (6,2), I eat it at turn 50.\n\nNow, what about the internal obstacle at (4,6)? Not affecting these moves.\n\nAlso, walls: I need to avoid going to borders.\n\nIn the path, (3,2) is at x=3,y=2, fine.\n\n(4,1) is y=1, close to wall but ok.\n\nNow, another thing: after eating both, I can go for (1,3).\n\nBut let's confirm the actions for the next few turns.\n\nI need to output actions for turn 47, 48, 49, etc., at least 5 turns.\n\nBut the answer should be for turns starting from t1=47.\n\nIn the second option:\n\nTurn 47: move L to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 48: from (3,3), I need to move to (3,2) to set up for (4,2)\n\nEarlier I said move D to (3,2)\n\nBut from (3,3), direction L, I can move D to (3,2)\n\nThen turn 49: from (3,2), move R to (4,2) to eat\n\nThen turn 50: from (4,2), move R to (5,2)  -- but at turn 50, from (4,2), after eating at turn 49, direction R, so move R to (5,2)\n\nThen turn 51: from (5,2), move R to (6,2) to eat\n\nBut at turn 50, after moving to (5,2), no eat, then at turn 51 move to (6,2) to eat.\n\nBut turn 51 is beyond, but I can plan.\n\nSince I need only a few turns, but think ahead.\n\nIn this, I have actions for turn 47,48,49,50,51.\n\nBut at turn 51, I eat (6,2).\n\nBut life span of (6,2): at turn 47, span 6; turn 48:5; turn 49:4; turn 50:3; turn 51:2, so still there.\n\nBut I can eat earlier? From (3,2) at turn 49, instead of going to (4,2), I could go elsewhere, but (4,2) expires soon.\n\n(4,2) at turn 49 must be eaten or lost.\n\nSo the path to (4,2) is necessary.\n\nAfter eating (4,2) at turn 49, I can go directly to (6,2) if possible, but from (4,2) to (6,2) is not adjacent; I need to go via (5,2) or (4,3) but (4,3) is body, so only (5,2) or (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is down, which might be away.\n\nBut going to (5,2) is fine.\n\nThen to (6,2).\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to specify actions.\n\nBut in the initial option at turn 47, I have only D or L.\n\nI think L is better for long-term.\n\nBut let's see if there is a risk.\n\nAnother thing: the snake body is coiled, and I need to avoid trapping myself.\n\nFor example, after moving to (3,3) at turn 47, the body is around (4,4),(4,5), etc.\n\nBut moving to (3,2) should be fine.\n\nThen to (4,2).\n\nNow, at (4,2), after eating, I have to move to (5,2) or (4,1).\n\n(4,1) is close to wall y=0, but y=1 is fine, not wall.\n\nBut moving down might be riskier if I go further down.\n\nBut for now, moving to (5,2) is towards (6,2).\n\nI could move to (4,1) to avoid, but no need.\n\nMoreover, there is food at (1,3), which is at (1,3), so I need to go left.\n\nAfter eating (6,2), I can head towards (1,3).\n\nBut for the immediate actions, let's list.\n\nSo for turn 47: move L to (3,3)\n\nThen for turn 48: from (3,3), move D to (3,2)  -- down\n\nThen turn 49: from (3,2), move R to (4,2) to eat\n\nThen turn 50: from (4,2), direction R, move R to (5,2)  -- no eat\n\nThen turn 51: from (5,2), direction R, move R to (6,2) to eat\n\nBut at turn 51, from (5,2) to (6,2) is right, and eat.\n\nBut I need to think if all moves are safe.\n\nAt turn 48, from (3,3) to (3,2): (3,2) is free, no problem.\n\nAt turn 49, from (3,2) to (4,2): (4,2) has food, free, eat.\n\nAt turn 50, from (4,2) to (5,2): (5,2) should be free, yes.\n\nAt turn 51, from (5,2) to (6,2): (6,2) should be free, and eat.\n\nNow, after that, I can go for (1,3).\n\nBut for the answer, since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I need to provide actions for multiple turns, but the format is to list actions for turns starting from t1.\n\nThe answer format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ... }\n\nAnd it doesn't specify how many, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide at least 5 actions or so.\n\nBut I can provide for turns 47 to 51 or 52.\n\nPerhaps up to when I eat the second food.\n\nBut let's see if there is a better way.\n\nAnother option: at turn 47, move L to (3,3), then at turn 48, instead of down, move left to (2,3), but then I might not reach (4,2) in time.\n\nFor example, if turn 48 move L to (2,3), then from (2,3) to (4,2) is not direct; I need to go to (3,2) or (2,2), etc., but at turn 49, (4,2) disappears if not eaten.\n\nIf I go to (2,3) at turn 48, then at turn 49, I can go to (2,2) or (3,3) or (1,3), but (4,2) is not reachable in one move, so I lose (4,2).\n\nThat would be bad, since I miss the food.\n\nSo moving to (3,2) at turn 48 is better to be close to (4,2).\n\nSimilarly, I could move down at turn 48, but to (3,2) is down.\n\nFrom (3,3), down to (3,2) or left to (2,3), but down is better for the food.\n\nSo the path seems good.\n\nNow, about the head direction: at turn 47, move L, so direction becomes L.\n\nAt turn 48, from (3,3) dir L, move D to (3,2), now direction is D.\n\nAt turn 49, from (3,2) dir D, move R to (4,2), direction R.\n\nAt turn 50, from (4,2) dir R, move R to (5,2), direction R.\n\nAt turn 51, from (5,2) dir R, move R to (6,2), direction R.\n\nAll fine, no instant reverse.\n\nNow, after that, I can consider going to (1,3).\n\nFor example, from (6,2), after eating, head at (6,2), then I can move left to (5,2) but (5,2) is body, or up to (6,3), etc.\n\nBut that's beyond 5 turns.\n\nFor the answer, I can provide up to turn 51.\n\nSince the food at (1,3) has long life, I can get it later.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should plan to eat all, but for now, the immediate actions.\n\nPerhaps I should include one more to start heading to (1,3).\n\nBut let's see the current plan.\n\nAnother thing: in the initial state, there is food at (6,2) but it was under body, and in my plan, I free it and eat it.\n\nIf I eat at turn 47, I might not get it.\n\nSo I think not eating at turn 47 is better.\n\nBut let's confirm the grid.\n\nSnake positions: let's plot to avoid dead ends.\n\nGrid:\n\nRows y=7 to y=0, x=0 to x=7.\n\nWalls: y=0, y=7, x=0, x=7.\n\nObstacle: (4,6)\n\nSnake at turn 47: head (4,3), body: (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)\n\nSo the snake is mostly on the right, from (4,3) to (6,1), with a loop at (4,4) to (5,5) etc.\n\nFood at (4,2), (6,2), (1,3)\n\n(6,2) is occupied.\n\nBy moving left first, I go to (3,3), freeing space.\n\nThen down to (3,2), then right to (4,2) eat, then right to (5,2), then right to (6,2) eat.\n\nAll safe.\n\nThen from (6,2), I can go up to (6,3) or left to (5,2) but occupied, or down to (6,1) but (6,1) might be free or not.\n\nAfter eating at (6,2), positions: head (6,2), body (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4) tail at (6,4)? After eat, tail remains.\n\nFrom (6,2), I can move U to (6,3), but (6,3) might be body? In positions, (6,3) is segment, occupied.\n\nAfter eat at (6,2), positions: head (6,2), then (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4) tail at (6,4).\n\nSo (6,3) not occupied? (6,3) is not in the list, should be free.\n\nSegments: (6,2) head, (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4) tail.\n\n(6,3) is not occupied, free.\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) free, etc.\n\nFrom (6,2), I can move U to (6,3), or D to (6,1), or L to (5,2) but (5,2) is body, collision, or R to (7,2) but x=7 wall, cannot.\n\nSo only U or D.\n\nThen I can go to (6,3), then to (6,4) but (6,4) is tail, but after move, it might change.\n\nBut I can start going left towards (1,3).\n\nFor example, move U to (6,3), then to (5,3) but (5,3) is body, etc.\n\nNeed to go around.\n\nBut not necessary for now.\n\nSo for the answer, I'll provide actions for turns 47 to 51.\n\nTurn 47: move L to (3,3)\n\nTurn 48: move D to (3,2)\n\nTurn 49: move R to (4,2)  (eat)\n\nTurn 50: move R to (5,2)\n\nTurn 51: move R to (6,2)  (eat)\n\nIn the move, for turn 49, moving to (4,2) eats, and for turn 51, to (6,2) eats.\n\nBut in the action, it's just the move, eating happens automatically.\n\nNow, I need to output in the box.\n\nBut let's see the direction to ensure no instant reverse, but I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I can add turn 52.\n\nBut 5 turns from 47: 47,48,49,50,51.\n\nt1=47, so turns 47 to 51 are 5 actions.\n\nt1, t1+1, t1+2, t1+3, t1+4: 47,48,49,50,51.\n\nYes.\n\nTo be safe, I can include the eat in description, but in action, it's just move.\n\nNow, another food: (1,3) at (1,3), which I can go after.\n\nFor example, from (6,2) after turn 51, move U to (6,3), then L to (5,3) but (5,3) is body, not free, so I need to go up or down first.\n\nBut not necessary now.\n\nI think the plan is good.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 47: L\n\nTurn 48: D\n\nTurn 49: R\n\nTurn 50: R\n\nTurn 51: R\n\nIn the answer format, it should be like \"U (up)\" etc.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{  \nTurn 47: L (left)  \nTurn 48: D (down)  \nTurn 49: R (right)  \nTurn 50: R (right)  \nTurn 51: R (right)  \n}\n\nBut for turn 49, moving R to (4,2) eats, and turn 51 to (6,2) eats.\n\nBut I need to make sure that at turn 50, moving to (5,2) is fine, which it is.\n\nPerhaps I can start moving towards (1,3) earlier, but with the need to eat (6,2), it's on the way.\n\n(6,2) is at x=6, (1,3) at x=1, so I need to go left.\n\nAfter eating (6,2) at turn 51, I can go left via (5,2) but occupied, so I need to go up to (6,3), then to (5,3) but (5,3) is body, etc.\n\nThe body will move as I go.\n\nFor example, if I move U to (6,3) at turn 52, then from there, I can move L to (5,3), but (5,3) is currently body, but after moves, it might be free.\n\nBut it's messy.\n\nSince the snake is long, I need to be careful not to trap.\n\nBut for now, the immediate actions are safe.\n\nI think it's ok.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, the AI must plan at least 5 turns ahead, considering food life spans, collision risks, and movement constraints. The current state (turn 47) has the snake head at (4,3) with direction left (L). Key observations:\n- Food at (4,2) has a short life span (3 turns, disappearing after turn 49) and must be eaten soon to avoid loss.\n- Food at (6,2) is currently under the snake's body (segment at turn 47) but can be eaten once freed by tail movement. It has a longer life span (6 turns, disappearing after turn 52).\n- Food at (1,3) has a long life span (9 turns) and can be pursued later.\n- Moving down (D) to (4,2) at turn 47 eats the food immediately but grows the snake, making it harder to free and eat (6,2) later due to increased length.\n- Moving left (L) to (3,3) avoids immediate growth, allowing the tail to free (6,2) faster. This enables a path to eat both (4,2) and (6,2) within their life spans while minimizing risk.\n\nThe chosen plan:\n- **Turn 47: Move L (left)** to (3,3). This avoids eating at (4,2) prematurely, freeing the tail cell (6,1) and starting the process to free (6,2). Direction becomes L.\n- **Turn 48: Move D (down)** to (3,2). This positions the head adjacent to (4,2) for the next turn. Direction becomes D.\n- **Turn 49: Move R (right)** to (4,2), eating the food (life span 1, disappears if not eaten). Snake grows by 1. Direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 50: Move R (right)** to (5,2). This moves toward (6,2) without eating, preparing for the next move. Direction remains R.\n- **Turn 51: Move R (right)** to (6,2), eating the food (life span 2, still available). Snake grows by 1.\n\nThis sequence eats both short-life foods by turn 51, scoring +2, while avoiding risks:\n- No collisions: All moves are to free cells, and no body/tail collisions occur (e.g., when eating (6,2), head is not adjacent to tail).\n- No instant reversals: Direction changes comply with rules (e.g., from D to R is allowed; only opposite moves are restricted).\n- Survival prioritized: The snake remains clear of walls (borders at x=0/7, y=0/7) and the internal obstacle (4,6). After turn 51, the snake can pursue (1,3) with a clear path.\n\nActions for turns 47 to 51 (5 turns ahead) are provided below.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 47: L (left)  \nTurn 48: D (down)  \nTurn 49: R (right)  \nTurn 50: R (right)  \nTurn 51: R (right)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 48, and I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), but since walls are at those coordinates, I can only move within (1,1) to (6,6), I think. Let me confirm.\n\nThe walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning those are the boundaries. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (4,6). So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), except (4,6) is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (3,3), and the body segments are: (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2). So the tail is at (6,2).\n\nThe snake head direction is L, which is left, so moving towards decreasing x.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (4,2) with life span 2, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (6,2) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (1,3) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food here.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for the next 5+ turns, starting from turn 48.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. Obstacle at (4,6).\n\nList all cells:\n\ny=6: (1,6) (2,6) (3,6) (4,6) obstacle (5,6) (6,6)\n\ny=5: (1,5) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) snake body (5,5) snake body (6,5) snake body\n\ny=4: (1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4) snake body (5,4) snake body (6,4) snake body\n\ny=3: (1,3) food (2,3) (3,3) snake head (4,3) snake body (5,3) snake body (6,3) snake body\n\ny=2: (1,2) (2,2) (3,2) (4,2) food (5,2) (6,2) food and snake tail? (6,2) has food but also is the tail position.\n\n(6,2) is both food and snake tail? Let's see the positions.\n\nSnake positions: [(3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2)] so (6,2) is the tail.\n\nFood: (4,2), (6,2), (1,3)\n\n(6,2) has food, but it's occupied by the snake tail. According to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\n\nAlso, there's a danger: Tail Reward Danger. If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nCurrent head position: (3,3)\n\nHead direction: L, so last move was left to (3,3), probably from (4,3)? Snake positions: head at (3,3), then (4,3), so it moved left from (4,3) to (3,3), so direction L.\n\nPossible moves from (3,3): U (up to y+1), D (down to y-1), L (left to x-1), R (right to x+1).\n\nBut movement constraints: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is L, so opposite is R, so cannot move right immediately.\n\nAlso, walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so from (3,3), possible moves:\n\n- U: (3,4) - is this free? Let's see what's at (3,4).\n\nFrom snake positions: (3,3) head, (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2). So (3,4) is not listed, so it should be empty.\n\nSimilarly, D: (3,2) - not listed, should be empty.\n\nL: (2,3) - not listed, empty.\n\nR: (4,3) - but (4,3) is occupied by body, so cannot move there.\n\nAlso, cannot move right because opposite direction? Current direction L, opposite is R, so cannot move R anyway.\n\nSo from (3,3), possible moves: U, D, L.\n\nNow, U: (3,4)\n\nD: (3,2)\n\nL: (2,3)\n\nI need to think ahead multiple turns to maximize score and avoid risks.\n\nFood available:\n\n- (4,2) at (4,2), life span 2, so it disappears after 2 turns including current? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 48, life span 2, so it will be there for turn 48 and 49, disappear after turn 49? Let's clarify.\n\nLife span N: disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nSo for food at (4,2) with life span 2 at turn 48:\n\n- Turn 48: life span 2, present\n\n- Turn 49: life span 1, present\n\n- Turn 50: life span 0, disappears, not present.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) life span 5 at turn 48, so present for turns 48 to 52, disappear at turn 53.\n\n(1,3) life span 8, present for many turns.\n\nAlso, (6,2) is currently occupied by the snake tail. Since it's under the body, we can only eat it if the tail moves away and head moves in.\n\nBut tail is at (6,2), and it's part of the snake.\n\nNow, let's think about the snake's movement.\n\nThe snake will move, and the tail will move forward, so positions shift.\n\nAfter each move, the head moves to a new cell, and if it eats food, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows. If not, tail moves, so snake length same.\n\nIn this case, all food is positive, so eating grows the snake.\n\nBut for (6,2), since it's under tail, we need to be careful.\n\nFirst, let's consider possible actions for turn 48.\n\nFrom (3,3), can go U to (3,4), D to (3,2), or L to (2,3).\n\nNow, I need to think about the food.\n\n(4,2) is close, but let's see the path.\n\nAlso, (1,3) is at (1,3), which is left, but we need to go left to reach it.\n\n(6,2) is at (6,2), which is where the tail is.\n\nNow, tail is at (6,2), and head is at (3,3), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so (3,3) and (6,2) are not adjacent; they are diagonally apart or something. Distance: |3-6|=3, |3-2|=1, not adjacent.\n\nAdjacent cells would be like (3,3) and (3,2), (3,4), (2,3), (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is body, not free.\n\nSo head not adjacent to tail.\n\nIf we eat the food at (6,2), since it's under tail, we need to move the tail away first.\n\nBut currently, tail is at (6,2), and when snake moves, if no food eaten, tail moves to the next position.\n\nLet's simulate the snake movement.\n\nCurrent snake: positions list: index 0 head: (3,3), 1: (4,3), 2: (5,3), 3: (5,4), 4: (4,4), 5: (4,5), 6: (5,5), 7: (6,5), 8: (6,4), 9: (6,3), 10: (6,2) tail.\n\nWhen snake moves, if it doesn't eat, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, and tail is removed.\n\nIf it eats, head moves to food, new head position, body segments move, but tail stays, so new segment added at tail position? No.\n\nStandard snake: when head moves to a cell with food, it eats, so the tail doesn't move, thus snake grows by one cell at the tail end.\n\nIf no food, tail moves forward.\n\nIn terms of positions: when head moves to new cell, if that cell has food, then the body segments shift, but the tail position remains for that turn, so a new segment is effectively added at the position where the tail was before moving? I need to clarify.\n\nTypically: after moving to a food cell, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't advance; the new position becomes part of the body.\n\nFor example: suppose snake at positions [A(head), B, C(tail)].\n\nMove head to D (with food): now snake is [D, A, B, C] , so C is still tail, no change.\n\nThen next move, if move to E (no food), then head to E, body to D and A, tail C is removed, so [E, D, A].\n\nBut in this case, when we eat at D, the tail C remains, so the snake has an extra segment at C.\n\nIn this state, when we eat, the length increases by one, and the tail position stays the same until the next move without eating.\n\nSimilarly here.\n\nFor (6,2), it is occupied by the tail. To eat it, we need to move the tail away, so that the cell becomes free, and then move the head there.\n\nBut when we move, if we don't eat, the tail moves, so (6,2) might become free if the tail advances.\n\nCurrently, tail at (6,2). When snake moves without eating, tail will move to the position of the previous segment.\n\nIn this case, segment 9 is (6,3), segment 10 is (6,2). When snake moves, if no eat, head moves to new position, segment 1 moves to old head position, segment 2 to old segment 1, ..., segment 10 to old segment 9 position.\n\nOld segment 9 is (6,3), so tail moves to (6,3), and (6,2) is vacated.\n\nThen, if there was food at (6,2), it is now exposed, and can be eaten if head moves there.\n\nBut head is at (3,3), which is far, so not immediately.\n\nAlso, the Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it causes collision.\n\nBut here, not adjacent.\n\nFirst, for turn 48, I need to choose a move.\n\nOptions: U, D, L.\n\nLet's evaluate each.\n\nIf U to (3,4): what is at (3,4)? From positions, not occupied, so safe. Then snake head at (3,4), direction U if we go up.\n\nThen positions: head (3,4), then old head (3,3) becomes body, so body: (3,3), (4,3), etc., tail (6,2) moves to (6,3) or something? Let's list new positions after move to (3,4) without eating (assuming no food there).\n\nHead moves to (3,4), then segment 1 (was (4,3)) moves to old head (3,3), segment 2 (5,3) to (4,3), segment 3 (5,4) to (5,3), segment 4 (4,4) to (5,4), segment 5 (4,5) to (4,4), segment 6 (5,5) to (4,5)? Positions: index 3 is (5,4), index 4 is (4,4), index 5 is (4,5), index 6 is (5,5), etc.\n\nAfter head moves to (3,4):\n\n- New head: (3,4)\n\n- New body segment 1: old head (3,3)\n\n- New segment 2: old segment 1 (4,3)\n\n- New segment 3: old segment 2 (5,3)\n\n- New segment 4: old segment 3 (5,4)\n\n- New segment 5: old segment 4 (4,4)\n\n- New segment 6: old segment 5 (4,5)\n\n- New segment 7: old segment 6 (5,5)\n\n- New segment 8: old segment 7 (6,5)\n\n- New segment 9: old segment 8 (6,4)\n\n- New segment 10: old segment 9 (6,3)  // tail was at (6,2), but since no eat, tail advances to old segment 9 position (6,3)\n\nOld segment 9 was (6,3), which is now the new tail position. Old tail (6,2) is vacated.\n\nSo (6,2) is now empty, and if there was food, it's still there, but we didn't eat it.\n\nSimilarly, for other moves.\n\nBut for turn 48, at (3,4), no food, so no eat.\n\nIf D to (3,2): (3,2) is empty, no food, so move there, head at (3,2), direction D.\n\nNew positions: head (3,2), body: (3,3), (4,3), ..., tail moves to (6,3), vacating (6,2).\n\n(3,2) has no food, so no eat.\n\nFood at (4,2) and (6,2), not at (3,2).\n\nIf L to (2,3): (2,3) empty, no food, head at (2,3), direction L.\n\nNew positions similar, tail moves.\n\nNow, food at (1,3) is to the left, so moving L might be towards it.\n\nBut (1,3) has life span 8, plenty of time.\n\n(4,2) has life span 2, so only available for this turn and next turn. Must eat by turn 49.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) has life span 5, available longer.\n\nBut (6,2) is currently occupied, will be vacated when tail moves.\n\nLet's plan to eat the food.\n\nFirst, (4,2) is at (4,2), which is down-right from head (3,3). From (3,3), to reach (4,2), we need to go right or down, but we cannot go right because of body and opposite direction? From (3,3), possible moves: U, D, L.\n\nD is (3,2), which is above (3,3)? y decreases down, so (3,2) is down from (3,3).\n\nCoordinates: (x,y), U: y+1, D: y-1, L: x-1, R: x+1.\n\nSo (3,3) to (3,2) is down.\n\n(4,2) is at x=4,y=2.\n\nFrom (3,3), to go to (4,2), we could go D to (3,2), then right to (4,2), or right to (4,3) but (4,3) is body, occupied, cannot, or down-right but must move one step.\n\nSo only way is to go down to (3,2) first, then from there to (4,2) if possible.\n\nFrom (3,2), possible moves: U to (3,3), but (3,3) will be body after move, D to (3,1), L to (2,2), R to (4,2).\n\nR to (4,2) is possible if (4,2) is free, which it is, and has food.\n\nSimilarly, from (3,3), if we go L to (2,3), then we can go down to (2,2) or left to (1,3) or up, but (1,3) is food.\n\nBut (4,2) has short life span, so we might want to eat it soon.\n\n(4,2) life span 2 at turn 48, so if we don't eat it by turn 49, it disappears.\n\nTurn 48: we can move to (3,2) or (2,3) or (3,4).\n\nIf we move to (3,2) on turn 48, then on turn 49, we can move to (4,2) to eat it, since from (3,2), R to (4,2) should be possible.\n\n(4,2) is not occupied by body; from positions, (4,2) is not listed, so empty except for food.\n\nFood is on the cell, but when we move head there, we eat it.\n\nSimilarly, if we go directly, but from (3,3) we cannot go directly to (4,2).\n\nSo option: turn 48: D to (3,2)\n\nThen turn 49: from (3,2), can go R to (4,2) to eat the food.\n\nBut when we eat at (4,2), the snake grows, so tail doesn't move.\n\nNow, is there any risk? Also, after eating, we need to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's see the path.\n\nTurn 48: move D to (3,2). Head now at (3,2), direction D.\n\nNew positions: head (3,2), body: (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), and tail was (6,2), but since no eat, tail moves to old segment 9 position (6,3)? Let's list.\n\nAfter move to (3,2) without eating (since (3,2) no food):\n\n- New head: (3,2)\n\n- New segment 1: old head (3,3)\n\n- New segment 2: old seg1 (4,3)\n\n- New segment 3: old seg2 (5,3)\n\n- New segment 4: old seg3 (5,4)\n\n- New segment 5: old seg4 (4,4)\n\n- New segment 6: old seg5 (4,5)\n\n- New segment 7: old seg6 (5,5)\n\n- New segment 8: old seg7 (6,5)\n\n- New segment 9: old seg8 (6,4)\n\n- New segment 10: old seg9 (6,3)  // tail now at (6,3)\n\nOld tail (6,2) vacated.\n\nFood at (6,2) is now exposed.\n\nBut we are at (3,2).\n\nThen turn 49: from (3,2), we can go R to (4,2) to eat the food there.\n\n(4,2) has food, value +1.\n\nMove to (4,2), eat food, so snake grows.\n\nNew positions: head at (4,2), which was empty except food.\n\nThen, since we eat, the body segments shift, but tail stays, so:\n\n- New head: (4,2)\n\n- New segment 1: old head (3,2)\n\n- New segment 2: old seg1 (3,3)\n\n- New segment 3: old seg2 (4,3)\n\n- New segment 4: old seg3 (5,3)\n\n- New segment 5: old seg4 (5,4)\n\n- New segment 6: old seg5 (4,4)\n\n- New segment 7: old seg6 (4,5)\n\n- New segment 8: old seg7 (5,5)\n\n- New segment 9: old seg8 (6,5)\n\n- New segment 10: old seg9 (6,4)\n\n- New segment 11: old tail position? When we eat, we add a new segment at the position of the old tail.\n\nIn the sequence, after eating, the tail doesn't advance, so the new segment is the old tail position.\n\nBefore move, tail was at (6,3) (from turn 48).\n\nAfter moving head to (4,2) and eating:\n\n- Head new: (4,2)\n\n- Body: the previous positions except that the tail is not removed.\n\nSo the new body includes all old segments plus the old tail position as a new segment.\n\nStandard: positions before move: [head, seg1, seg2, ..., seg10 tail]\n\nAfter move to new cell with food: [new_head, old_head, old_seg1, ..., old_seg10] so length increases by one, tail is old_seg10.\n\nIn this case, before move on turn 49, positions: head (3,2), body: (3,3), (4,3), ..., up to tail (6,3)\n\nAfter moving to (4,2) with food:\n\n- New head: (4,2)\n\n- New segment 1: old head (3,2)\n\n- New segment 2: old seg1 (3,3)\n\n- New segment 3: old seg2 (4,3)\n\n- New segment 4: old seg3 (5,3)\n\n- New segment 5: old seg4 (5,4)\n\n- New segment 6: old seg5 (4,4)\n\n- New segment 7: old seg6 (4,5)\n\n- New segment 8: old seg7 (5,5)\n\n- New segment 9: old seg8 (6,5)\n\n- New segment 10: old seg9 (6,4)\n\n- New segment 11: old seg10 (6,3)  // new tail\n\nSo tail now at (6,3), and the cell (4,2) is eaten.\n\nNow, what about the food at (6,2)? It was vacated on turn 48, and is still there with life span decreasing.\n\nLife span of (6,2) was 5 at turn 48, at turn 49 it becomes 4, etc.\n\nAfter eating at (4,2), we are at (4,2), head direction? We moved right from (3,2), so direction R.\n\nNow, possible moves from (4,2): U to (4,3), but (4,3) is body? New positions: segment 3 is (4,3), which is body, so occupied.\n\nD to (4,1), if within bounds, y=1 is ok, since walls at y=0.\n\nL to (3,2), but (3,2) is segment 1, body.\n\nR to (5,2), which should be free? (5,2) not in positions, probably free.\n\nSo from (4,2), possible moves: U to (4,3) but body, cannot; D to (4,1) free; L to (3,2) body, cannot; R to (5,2) free.\n\nAlso, cannot move opposite to current direction? Current direction is R, since we just moved right, so opposite is L, but L is to (3,2) which is body anyway, so not possible. D and R possible.\n\nU and L not possible because occupied or opposite? L is opposite to R, so cannot move left.\n\nDirections: we moved R to (4,2), so current direction R.\n\nOpposite is L, so cannot move L.\n\nU and D are perpendicular, so allowed.\n\nBut U to (4,3) is occupied by body (segment 3: (4,3)), so cannot move there.\n\nD to (4,1) should be free.\n\nR to (5,2) free.\n\nSo only D or R.\n\nNow, we need to think further.\n\nBut we have other food to consider.\n\n(6,2) is at (6,2), which has food, and it's free now, since vacated on turn 48.\n\nTo eat (6,2), we need to move head there.\n\nBut from (4,2), we can go R to (5,2), then to (6,2).\n\n(5,2) should be free.\n\nFrom (5,2), we can go to (6,2) to eat.\n\nBut let's see the tail position.\n\nAlso, (1,3) is available.\n\nBut first, back to turn 48.\n\nIf we go D to (3,2) on turn 48, then turn 49 to (4,2) to eat, as above.\n\nBut is there a better move?\n\nAnother option: go L to (2,3) on turn 48.\n\nThen from (2,3), we can go to (1,3) to eat the food there on turn 49.\n\n(1,3) has life span 8, so not urgent, but we can eat it.\n\n(4,2) might disappear if not eaten soon.\n\nIf we go L on turn 48 to (2,3), then on turn 49, we can go L to (1,3) to eat.\n\nBut (4,2) will disappear after turn 49, so if we don't eat it, we lose it.\n\nSimilarly, if we go U to (3,4) on turn 48, we might not get to (4,2) in time.\n\nFrom (3,4), to reach (4,2), it might take more turns.\n\nFor example, from (3,4), possible moves: U to (3,5), D to (3,3) but (3,3) will be body, L to (2,4), R to (4,4) but (4,4) is body.\n\nAfter moving to (3,4) on turn 48:\n\nNew positions: head (3,4), body (3,3), (4,3), etc., tail to (6,3).\n\nThen from (3,4), can go U to (3,5) if free, D to (3,3) body occupied, L to (2,4) free, R to (4,4) body occupied.\n\nSo U or L.\n\nTo get to (4,2), it might take: e.g., go L to (2,4), then down to (2,3) or something, not direct, and (4,2) might disappear by turn 50.\n\nSo probably better to go for (4,2) now.\n\nMoreover, (6,2) is available, but farther.\n\n(1,3) is also available.\n\nBut since (4,2) is urgent, I think going for it is good.\n\nAlso, after eating (4,2), we are at (4,2), and we can consider eating (6,2) next.\n\n(6,2) life span 5, at turn 48, so after turn 49, life span 3 left, still time.\n\nNow, after eating at (4,2) on turn 49, we are at (4,2) with direction R.\n\nThen turn 50: from (4,2), as before, can go D to (4,1) or R to (5,2).\n\nIf we go R to (5,2), then head at (5,2), direction R.\n\n(5,2) should be free, no food? Food is at (6,2), not (5,2).\n\nThen turn 51: from (5,2), can go to (6,2) to eat, since (6,2) has food.\n\nBut is it safe?\n\nFirst, at turn 50, after moving to (5,2) without eating.\n\nPositions: before turn 50, after turn 49: head (4,2), body (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), tail (6,3)\n\nAfter turn 50 move to (5,2) no eat: head to (5,2), body to (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), tail to (6,4)\n\nThen turn 51: from (5,2), can go to (6,2) to eat.\n\n(6,2) has food, so move to (6,2), eat.\n\nNow, check Tail Reward Danger: head at (5,2), tail at (6,4), not adjacent. (5,2) and (6,4) are not adjacent; adjacent would be (6,2) or (5,3), etc.\n\n(6,2) is adjacent to (5,2)? (5,2) to (6,2) is right, same y, x+1, so yes, adjacent.\n\nBut tail is at (6,4), not at (6,2).\n\n(6,2) has food, but tail is elsewhere.\n\nThe danger is only if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has food, meaning when we move to eat the food at tail position.\n\nIn this case, (6,2) is not the tail position; tail is at (6,4), so no danger.\n\nMove to (6,2), eat food, grow.\n\nNew positions: head (6,2), body: old head (5,2), and previous body, tail stays? After eating, new segment at old tail position.\n\nBefore move, tail at (6,4), so after eat, tail remains (6,4) as body, new tail is the previous position? \n\nAfter moving to (6,2) with food:\n\n- New head: (6,2)\n\n- New segment 1: old head (5,2)\n\n- New segment 2: old seg1 (4,2)  // which was head before\n\n- New segment 3: old seg2 (3,2)\n\n- New segment 4: old seg3 (3,3)\n\n- ... and so on, up to new segment 12: old tail (6,4)\n\nSince we added one segment.\n\nBefore move, there were 12 segments? After eating at (4,2), snake had 12 positions: head + 11 body/tail? From earlier: after turn 49, positions: head (4,2), and 11 body segments including tail, so length 12.\n\nIn turn 49, after eating, we have 12 cells.\n\nThen turn 50, move to (5,2) no eat: head (5,2), body: (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), ..., up to tail (6,4), so 12 positions, tail at (6,4).\n\nThen turn 51, move to (6,2) with food: head to (6,2), body: old head (5,2), old seg1 (4,2), old seg2 (3,2), ..., old seg11 (6,4), so now 13 positions, tail at (6,4).\n\n(6,4) is still tail.\n\nAnd (6,2) is head.\n\nNo immediate collision.\n\nBut we need to avoid walls and body.\n\nNow, after that, we can go to other places.\n\nBut back to turn 48.\n\nAnother option: what if we go to (3,2) on turn 48, but instead of going to (4,2) on turn 49, we do something else? But (4,2) must be eaten by turn 49, so we should eat it.\n\nIf we don't go to (3,2) on turn 48, we might miss it.\n\nFor example, if we go L to (2,3), then on turn 49 we eat (1,3), but (4,2) disappears.\n\nSimilarly, if we go U, same.\n\nSo to not miss the food, going D on turn 48 seems best.\n\nMoreover, after eating (4,2), we are positioned to go for (6,2) or other.\n\nBut let's consider the food at (6,2). It was vacated, and we can eat it soon.\n\nThere is also the internal obstacle at (4,6), but not relevant immediately.\n\nNow, what about moving left towards (1,3)? We can do that after.\n\n(1,3) has long life span.\n\nNow, another point: the head direction constraint.\n\nAfter turn 49, when we are at (4,2) with direction R, we can go R or D.\n\nIf we go D to (4,1), we go to the bottom, might be dead end or something.\n\ny=1, and walls at y=0, so (4,1) is ok.\n\nBut then from there, we can go left or right, but not up immediately if body is there.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nAfter eating (4,2), positions: head (4,2), body: (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), tail (6,3)\n\nNow, (4,3) is body, (3,2) is body, etc.\n\nFrom (4,2), if we go D to (4,1), it should be free.\n\nThen we are at (4,1), direction D.\n\nThen we can go L to (3,1), R to (5,1), or U to (4,2) but (4,2) is body now, cannot.\n\nBut going down might not be productive; we have food at (6,2) and (1,3).\n\nSimilarly, if we go R to (5,2) on turn 50, as before, then to (6,2) on turn 51.\n\n(5,2) is free.\n\nThen we eat (6,2) on turn 51.\n\nNow, (6,2) life span: at turn 48, life 5; turn 49, life 4; turn 50, life 3; turn 51, life 2, so we eat it on turn 51 with life 2, still present.\n\nAfter that, we can go to (1,3).\n\n(1,3) is at (1,3), which is left.\n\nAfter eating (6,2), head at (6,2), direction R (if we came from left).\n\nThen from there, possible moves.\n\nBut let's plan the actions.\n\nFirst, for turn 48, go D to (3,2).\n\nThen turn 49, go R to (4,2) to eat.\n\nThen turn 50, from (4,2) we go R to (5,2).\n\nThen turn 51, from (5,2) go R to (6,2) to eat.\n\nNow, turn 52: after eating (6,2) on turn 51, head at (6,2), direction R.\n\nPositions: after turn 51 eat at (6,2): head (6,2), body: old head (5,2), old seg1 (4,2), old seg2 (3,2), ..., up to old seg11 (6,4), and since ate, new segment at old tail (6,4)? Before move on turn 51, tail was at (6,4) (from turn 50).\n\nAfter move to (6,2) with food: head (6,2), body: (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)  // tail at (6,4)\n\nLength 13.\n\nNow, from (6,2), possible moves: U to (6,3), but (6,3) is body? Positions: (6,3) is not listed; in body, we have (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), etc., and (6,5), (6,4). (6,3) is not in the list, so should be free.\n\nList the positions: head (6,2), then (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4) tail.\n\nSo (6,3) is not occupied, free.\n\nSimilarly, D to (6,1), if within bounds.\n\nL to (5,2) but (5,2) is segment 1, body, cannot.\n\nR to (7,2) but x=7 is wall, cannot.\n\nSo from (6,2), possible: U to (6,3), D to (6,1), L to (5,2) occupied, cannot, R to (7,2) wall, cannot.\n\nAlso, direction: we just moved R to (6,2), so current direction R, opposite L, but L is occupied anyway.\n\nU and D possible.\n\nU to (6,3) or D to (6,1).\n\n(6,3) is free, as above.\n\n(6,1) should be free.\n\nNow, we need to go to (1,3), which is left and up.\n\nSo U to (6,3) might be better.\n\nThen from (6,3), we can go left or up.\n\nBut there is food at (1,3).\n\nAlso, the snake body is around, so we need to find a path.\n\nSince we are at (6,2), going U to (6,3) is towards the body? (6,3) is free, as per positions.\n\nThen from (6,3), can go U to (6,4) but (6,4) is tail? Positions: (6,4) is tail, but when we move, it will change.\n\nAfter moving to (6,3) on turn 52, no eat (assuming no food).\n\nHead to (6,3), body to (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), etc., tail advances.\n\nBut let's not go too far yet.\n\nFor now, the plan up to turn 51 seems good.\n\nBut we need to output actions for multiple turns, starting from turn 48.\n\nThe answer should be actions for turn 48, 49, 50, etc.\n\nBut how many turns? It says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output format shows \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so probably for several turns.\n\nSince we have a plan, we can output for, say, 5 turns or so.\n\nBut let's see if we can include eating (1,3).\n\nAfter turn 51, we are at (6,2), then go U to (6,3) on turn 52.\n\nThen from (6,3), possible moves: U to (6,4), but (6,4) is currently tail, but when we move to (6,3), positions change.\n\nAfter turn 52 move to (6,3) no eat: head (6,3), body: (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), tail to (6,4)? Old tail was (6,4), but since no eat, tail moves to previous segment.\n\nBefore move, tail at (6,4).\n\nAfter move to (6,3) no eat: head (6,3), segment 1: old head (6,2), segment 2: old seg1 (5,2), ..., segment 12: old seg11 (6,5), and tail moves to old seg12 position? Old positions: head (6,2), seg1 (5,2), seg2 (4,2), ..., seg11 (6,5), seg12 (6,4) tail.\n\nAfter move to (6,3): new head (6,3), new seg1: old head (6,2), new seg2: old seg1 (5,2), ..., new seg12: old seg11 (6,5), and since no eat, no new segment, so tail is new seg12 (6,5)? Indices.\n\nOld segments: index 0 head (6,2), index 1 (5,2), index 2 (4,2), index 3 (3,2), index 4 (3,3), index 5 (4,3), index 6 (5,3), index 7 (5,4), index 8 (4,4), index 9 (4,5), index 10 (5,5), index 11 (6,5), index 12 (6,4) tail.\n\nAfter move to (6,3) no eat: new head (6,3), new index 1: old head (6,2), new index 2: old index 1 (5,2), new index 3: old index 2 (4,2), new index 4: old index 3 (3,2), new index 5: old index 4 (3,3), new index 6: old index 5 (4,3), new index 7: old index 6 (5,3), new index 8: old index 7 (5,4), new index 9: old index 8 (4,4), new index 10: old index 9 (4,5), new index 11: old index 10 (5,5), new index 12: old index 11 (6,5), tail at (6,5).\n\n(6,4) is vacated.\n\nNow, from (6,3), head at (6,3), direction U (since we moved up from (6,2)? From (6,2) to (6,3) is up, y+1, so U.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (6,4), but (6,4) is now free? After move, (6,4) was old tail, vacated.\n\nIn new positions, (6,4) not occupied, free.\n\nD to (6,2), but (6,2) is body, occupied.\n\nL to (5,3), which is body? (5,3) is new index 7? New positions: head (6,3), seg1 (6,2), seg2 (5,2), seg3 (4,2), seg4 (3,2), seg5 (3,3), seg6 (4,3), seg7 (5,3), so (5,3) is seg7, occupied.\n\nR to (7,3) wall, cannot.\n\nSo from (6,3), possible: U to (6,4) free, D to (6,2) occupied, cannot, L to (5,3) occupied, cannot, R wall cannot.\n\nOnly U to (6,4).\n\nThen go to (6,4).\n\nBut (6,4) is now free, no food.\n\nThen from there, similar.\n\nTo reach (1,3), we need to go left.\n\nFrom (6,4), after moving, etc.\n\nBut it might take many turns.\n\nSince we are at (6,3), we can only go up to (6,4), then from (6,4) we can go U to (6,5) but (6,5) is body? After moving to (6,4), let's see.\n\nThis might not be efficient.\n\nAfter turn 51, at (6,2), instead of going up, we could go down to (6,1).\n\nThen from (6,1), can go L to (5,1), etc.\n\nBut still, to (1,3) is far.\n\nPerhaps after eating (6,2), we should head left.\n\nBut from (6,2), we can only go U or D, both not left.\n\nGoing U to (6,3), then we are stuck going up to (6,4), then (6,5) might be occupied or not.\n\nAfter moving to (6,3) on turn 52, we go to (6,4) on turn 53.\n\nFrom (6,4), after move: head (6,4), body (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), etc., tail at (6,5) or something.\n\nThen from (6,4), can go U to (6,5) if free, but (6,5) is currently body? Before move, (6,5) is segment 11.\n\nAfter move to (6,4): head (6,4), seg1 (6,3), seg2 (6,2), seg3 (5,2), ..., up to seg11 (5,5) or something, tail at (6,5)? Let's not detail.\n\ny=5 has (5,5) and (6,5), etc.\n\nFrom (6,4), U to (6,5) might be free if not body, but it could be.\n\nTo save time, since (1,3) has long life, we can get it later, or after eating (4,2), instead of going right to (6,2), we go left towards (1,3).\n\nLet's consider that alternative.\n\nOn turn 49, after eating (4,2) at (4,2), with direction R.\n\nInstead of going R to (5,2), we go D to (4,1), but that might not help.\n\nOr, we can change direction.\n\nFrom (4,2), we can only go D or R, as U and L not possible.\n\nR to (5,2) or D to (4,1).\n\nIf we go D to (4,1), then at (4,1), direction D.\n\nThen from (4,1), can go L to (3,1), R to (5,1), or U to (4,2) body, cannot.\n\nThen we can go left to (3,1), then to (2,1), etc., but to reach (1,3), we need to go up.\n\n(1,3) is at y=3, so from bottom, we need to go up.\n\nFor example, from (4,1) go L to (3,1), then L to (2,1), then U to (2,2), then U to (2,3), then L to (1,3).\n\nBut multiple turns.\n\nWhereas if we go to (6,2) first, it might be faster to eat, but then we are at right side.\n\n(6,2) life span longer, but we can eat it on turn 51 as planned.\n\nAfter that, we can navigate left.\n\nBut let's see the grid occupation.\n\nThe snake body is mostly on the right and center, so left side is more free.\n\nFor example, cells like (1,1) to (3,1), (1,2), (2,2), (1,3), (2,3) etc. are free, except (1,3) has food.\n\n(2,3) might be free.\n\nIn current state, (1,3) food, (2,3) empty, (3,3) body, etc.\n\nAfter some moves, it might change.\n\nBut since we are planning, for now, let's stick with eating both (4,2) and (6,2) soon.\n\nThen for (1,3), we can go later.\n\nIn the action plan, we can output up to turn 51 or 52.\n\nThe answer should start from turn 48.\n\nSo for turn 48: D to (3,2)\n\nTurn 49: R to (4,2) eat\n\nThen turn 50: R to (5,2)\n\nTurn 51: R to (6,2) eat\n\nThen turn 52: from (6,2), we need to choose, say U to (6,3)\n\nBut we should think 5+ turns, so up to turn 53 or so.\n\nAfter turn 51, at (6,2), we go U to (6,3) on turn 52.\n\nThen turn 53: from (6,3), only U to (6,4) as we saw earlier.\n\nThen turn 54: from (6,4), can go U to (6,5) or other.\n\n(6,5) might be body or not.\n\nTo avoid being stuck, perhaps after eating (6,2), we should go down to (6,1) if possible.\n\nAt turn 51, from (6,2), we can go D to (6,1) instead of U.\n\n(6,1) should be free, within bounds.\n\nThen at (6,1), direction D.\n\nThen from (6,1), can go L to (5,1), or U to (6,2) body, cannot, R wall cannot, D to (6,0) wall, cannot.\n\nSo only L to (5,1).\n\nThen from (5,1), and so on, we can go left and up to (1,3).\n\nFor example, turn 52: D to (6,1)\n\nTurn 53: L to (5,1)\n\nTurn 54: L to (4,1) or U to (5,2), etc.\n\nBut (5,2) might be body or not, depending.\n\nSince (1,3) is at (1,3), we can go directly towards it.\n\nBut in the plan, for output, we can specify.\n\nSince the food at (1,3) has life span 8, at turn 48, so it will be there until turn 55 or so, plenty of time.\n\nTurn 48 life span 8, so disappears after 8 turns, at turn 56.\n\nSo we have until turn 55 to eat it.\n\nIn our plan, by turn 51 we are at (6,2), then we can start moving left.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions for the first few turns.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (4,6), but we are not going there, so fine.\n\nAlso, Tail Reward Danger: not an issue here.\n\nNow, for the answer, I think:\n\nTurn 48: D (down)\n\nTurn 49: R (right) to eat (4,2)\n\nTurn 50: R (right) to (5,2)\n\nTurn 51: R (right) to eat (6,2)\n\nThen for turn 52, we can go D to (6,1) to start moving down and left.\n\nOr U, but D might be better to go to lower y.\n\ny decreases down, so (6,1) is bottom.\n\nThen we can go left.\n\nSince we need to output actions, and think ahead, but the snake can choose based on state, but for the plan, we specify.\n\nIn the output format, it should be a sequence.\n\nPerhaps output for 5 turns: turn 48 to 52.\n\nTurn 48: D\n\nTurn 49: R\n\nTurn 50: R\n\nTurn 51: R\n\nThen turn 52: D or U.\n\nBut after turn 51, at (6,2), going U or D.\n\nIf we go D to (6,1), then we can later go to (5,1), etc.\n\nIf we go U to (6,3), we might go to (6,4), etc.\n\nGoing down might be better to avoid the body above.\n\nFor example, at (6,2), the cells above: (6,3) free, (6,4) might be free later, but y=5 and y=6 have some body.\n\n(4,5), (5,5), (6,5) are body, and (4,6) obstacle, so the top might be congested.\n\nBottom: y=1 and y=2, cells like (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2) but (3,2) is body? After some moves.\n\nCurrently, after eating, positions change.\n\nTo be safe, going down to (6,1) might open more space.\n\nThen from (6,1), go left to (5,1), then to (4,1), etc.\n\nThen up to (1,3).\n\nFor instance:\n\nTurn 52: D to (6,1)\n\nThen turn 53: from (6,1), only L to (5,1)\n\nTurn 54: from (5,1), can go L to (4,1), or U to (5,2), or D to (5,0) wall, cannot.\n\nU to (5,2): (5,2) might be free or not.\n\nAfter turn 51, positions: head (6,2), body (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), tail (6,4)\n\nThen if turn 52: D to (6,1), no eat, so head (6,1), body (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), tail to (6,5)? Old tail (6,4), advances.\n\nAfter move: head (6,1), seg1 (6,2), seg2 (5,2), seg3 (4,2), seg4 (3,2), seg5 (3,3), seg6 (4,3), seg7 (5,3), seg8 (5,4), seg9 (4,4), seg10 (4,5), seg11 (5,5), seg12 (6,5) tail.\n\n(6,4) vacated.\n\nNow from (6,1), direction D.\n\nThen turn 53: from (6,1), can go L to (5,1), since U to (6,2) body, R wall, D wall.\n\nSo L to (5,1).\n\n(5,1) should be free.\n\nThen head to (5,1), direction L (since left).\n\nThen body shifts, tail to (5,5) or something.\n\nThen from (5,1), can go L to (4,1), U to (5,2), or D to (5,0) wall.\n\nU to (5,2): (5,2) is seg2 in current positions, body, occupied, cannot.\n\nL to (4,1) free, or D invalid.\n\nSo only L to (4,1).\n\nThen turn 54: L to (4,1)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThen to reach (1,3), we need to go to (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), then U to (1,2), U to (1,3), etc.\n\nBut (1,3) is at (1,3), so from (1,1) or (2,1), we can go up.\n\nBut multiple turns.\n\nSince time, for the answer, we can output the first 5 actions.\n\nSo for turn 48 to 52:\n\nTurn 48: D\n\nTurn 49: R\n\nTurn 50: R\n\nTurn 51: R\n\nTurn 52: D\n\nThen later turns can be chosen.\n\nBut in turn 52, we go D to (6,1) to head down.\n\nSince we are to think 5+ turns, and prioritize survival, this seems ok.\n\nAnother option: after eating (4,2) on turn 49, instead of going right, we go down to (4,1), then left.\n\nBut (6,2) might not be eaten, and it disappears later, but we can still eat it if we want, but it might be out of way.\n\nIn this case, with the plan, we eat both foods.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 48: D (down)\n\nTurn 49: R (right)\n\nTurn 50: R (right)\n\nTurn 51: R (right)\n\nFor turn 52, we said D, but to be consistent, output 5 actions.\n\nPerhaps include one more.\n\nBut turn 52 is t1+4, since t1=48, t1+1=49, t1+2=50, t1+3=51, t1+4=52.\n\n5 turns: 48 to 52.\n\nIn the sequence, after turn 51, at (6,2), go D to (6,1).\n\nThen for turn 53, L to (5,1), etc., but not needed.\n\nSo for answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 48: D\nTurn 49: R\nTurn 50: R\nTurn 51: R\nTurn 52: D\n}\n\nBut let's confirm the directions.\n\nTurn 48: from (3,3) down to (3,2)\n\nTurn 49: from (3,2) right to (4,2) eat\n\nTurn 50: from (4,2) right to (5,2)\n\nTurn 51: from (5,2) right to (6,2) eat\n\nTurn 52: from (6,2) down to (6,1)\n\nAll moves are valid and safe.\n\nAnd we eat two foods, avoid missing (4,2), and (6,2) eaten on time.\n\nLater, we can go for (1,3).\n\nSo this should be good.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating positive food while ensuring long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned 5 turns ahead (turns 48 to 52). The key considerations are:\n- **Food urgency**: (4,2) has a life span of 2 at turn 48, meaning it disappears after turn 49. It must be eaten by turn 49 to avoid losing it. (6,2) has a life span of 5 (disappears after turn 52) and (1,3) has a life span of 8 (disappears after turn 55), so they are less urgent.\n- **Path to food**: From the head position (3,3) at turn 48, moving down (D) to (3,2) sets up a path to eat (4,2) on turn 49. Then, continuing right (R) allows eating (6,2) by turn 51.\n- **Collision avoidance**: All moves avoid walls, body segments, and instant reversals. After eating (4,2) on turn 49, the head is at (4,2) with direction R, so moving right to (5,2) on turn 50 is safe. Similarly, moving to (6,2) on turn 51 is safe as the tail is not adjacent, avoiding Tail Reward Danger.\n- **Long-term survival**: After eating both foods, moving down to (6,1) on turn 52 positions the snake to navigate toward the left side where (1,3) is located, avoiding congested areas and the obstacle at (4,6). The left side has more free space, reducing collision risk for future turns.\n\n**Action Plan (Turns 48 to 52):**\n- **Turn 48**: Move down (D) to (3,2). This avoids missing (4,2) and sets up the path. (No food eaten; tail moves, vacating (6,2).)\n- **Turn 49**: Move right (R) to (4,2) to eat the food (+1 score, snake grows). Head direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 50**: Move right (R) to (5,2). (No food eaten; prepares to reach (6,2).)\n- **Turn 51**: Move right (R) to (6,2) to eat the food (+1 score, snake grows). Head direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 52**: Move down (D) to (6,1). This starts the movement toward the bottom-left to access (1,3) later, avoiding body congestion in upper areas.\n\n**Reasoning for 5+ Turns:**\n- By turn 52, both urgent foods are eaten, and the snake is positioned to safely navigate to (1,3) in subsequent turns (e.g., via (5,1), (4,1), etc.), with ample time (life span until turn 55).\n- This plan prioritizes survival by:\n  - Eating high-urgency food first.\n  - Avoiding dead ends and body collisions through open paths.\n  - Steering toward less occupied areas after eating.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 48: D\nTurn 49: R\nTurn 50: R\nTurn 51: R\nTurn 52: D\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 49. The grid has walls on the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There's also an internal obstacle at (4,6). The snake positions are: head at (3,2), then (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3). That's 11 segments. The head direction is down, which is (x,y-1), but since it's moving down, y decreases? No, let's clarify directions:\n\n- U: (x, y+1) - up, y increases\n\n- D: (x, y-1) - down, y decreases\n\n- L: (x-1, y)\n\n- R: (x+1, y)\n\nHead direction is D, so currently moving down, meaning next move would be from (3,2) to, say, if it continues down, to (3,1), but y=0 is a wall, so it can't go there. Let's list the snake positions clearly:\n\nSnake: [(3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)]\n\nHead is at (3,2), tail is at (6,3). Since head direction is D, it's moving down. From (3,2), moving down would be to (3,1), but y=1 is not necessarily a wall? Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is inside. y=0 is the wall, so (3,1) should be accessible unless it's an obstacle, but obstacles are only at (4,6) and borders. Borders are x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so cells like (3,1) should be fine.\n\nBut let's confirm the grid: it's from x=0 to x=7, y=0 to y=7, with walls on those borders, meaning we can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. So the playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, since x=0 and x=7 are walls, similarly y=0 and y=7.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 inclusive. Similarly y from 1 to 6 inclusive. Because y=0 and y=7 are walls.\n\nNow, internal obstacle at (4,6). (4,6) has y=6, which is the top row? y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? Typically in grids, y=0 might be bottom or top, but here it doesn't specify, but since moving up increases y, U is (x,y+1), so y increases upwards, I think. So y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top wall.\n\nSimilarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nSo playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6). Since y=6 is the top row, and (4,6) is at x=4,y=6, which is on the border? y=6 is not y=7, so it's inside. y=7 is the wall, so y=6 is the second row from top, but since walls are at y=0 and y=7, the cells y=1 to y=6 are playable, so (4,6) is a valid cell but has an obstacle, so we can't go there.\n\nSo obstacles: all cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (4,6).\n\nNow food:\n\n- (4,2,1,1) : position (4,2), value 1, life span 1? The format is (x,y, value, life_span) I think. From the input: \"(4, 2, 1, 1)\" so (x,y) = (4,2), value=1, life_span=1\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- (6,2,4,1) : (6,2), value=1? value=4? Let's read: \" (6, 2, 4, 1) \" and it says \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value\", so for each: (x,y, value, life_span)\n\nIn the list: \" (4, 2, 1, 1) \" so (4,2), value=1, life_span=1\n\n\" (6, 2, 4, 1) \" (6,2), value=4? But it says value and life span, but in the core rules, food has value +1 or -1, but here it says value=1 or 4? That can't be right.\n\nLook back: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - (4, 2, 1, 1) - (6, 2, 4, 1) - (1, 3, 7, 1) - (6, 3, 10, 1)\"\n\nAnd core rules say food can be positive or negative, with value +1 or -1, but here values are 1,4,7,10? That doesn't match.\n\nPerhaps I misread. The input says: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (4, 2, 1, 1) \" but it might be (x,y, life_span, value) or what?\n\nLet's see the description: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span\" and then listed as (x1,y1, value1, life_span1) etc.\n\nBut in core rules, value should be +1 for positive, -1 for negative. But here for (4,2,1,1), if value is 1, that's positive, life_span=1.\n\nSimilarly (6,2,4,1), value=4? But value should be +1 or -1, not 4. That can't be.\n\nPerhaps it's a typo or I misremember. Let's check the core rules.\n\nCore rules: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\"\n\nAnd value1 should be +1 or -1, but here it's given as 1,4,7,10 which are all positive, but not 1.\n\n4,7,10 are not +1, so that must be life_span first or something.\n\nLook at the input: \" (4, 2, 1, 1) \" and it says \"Life Span and Value\", but in the list, it might be (x,y, life_span, value) or (x,y, value, life_span)?\n\nThe text says: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span\" then \"- (4, 2, 1, 1)\" so it's ambiguous.\n\nBut in the core rules, it's \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) \" so it should be position, then value, then life_span.\n\nFor (4,2,1,1), that would be value=1, life_span=1.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2,4,1) value=4, life_span=1? But value should be +1 or -1 for the game, but 4 is not ±1. That doesn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps it's a mistake, or perhaps the value is the reward, and it can be different, but core rules say +1 or -1.\n\nLet's read core rules again: \"Positive Food - Reward Value = +1\", \"Negative Food - Penalty Value = -1\", so value should be exactly +1 or -1.\n\nBut here we have values like 4,7,10, which are not ±1.\n\nPerhaps the input is misformatted. Let's see the list: \" (4, 2, 1, 1) \" and \" (6, 2, 4, 1) \" etc.\n\nAnother possibility: the \"1,1\" for (4,2) might be life_span and value, but the order is value then life_span as per text.\n\nI think there might be a confusion. Let's look at the food list: \" (4, 2, 1, 1) \" and it's under \"Value and Life Span\", so likely value=1, life_span=1 for (4,2).\n\nBut for (6,2,4,1), value=4, life_span=1, but value should be ±1, so perhaps it's a different value? But the core rules don't allow that.\n\nPerhaps it's life_span first. Let's see the last one: (6,3,10,1), value=10, life_span=1? That can't be.\n\nOr perhaps it's (x,y), then life_span, then value, but the text says \"Value and Life Span\".\n\nI think I need to assume that the numbers are as per the description. But for the sake of this, since all values are positive (1,4,7,10 are all positive), I'll assume they are all positive food with different rewards? But core rules say reward +1 for positive, so it should be +1.\n\nThis is confusing. Perhaps it's a typo in the input. Let's read carefully: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (4, 2, 1, 1) \" it says \"Life Span and Value\" but earlier it says \"Value and Life Span\" in the core rules section? No.\n\nIn the state input format, it says \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span\", but in the current state, it says \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value\", so the order might be switched.\n\nIn current state: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (4, 2, 1, 1) \" so it specifies \"Life Span and Value\", so for each tuple, it's (x,y, life_span, value).\n\nFor (4,2,1,1): (4,2), life_span=1, value=1 (positive)\n\nFor (6,2,4,1): (6,2), life_span=4, value=1 (positive)\n\nFor (1,3,7,1): (1,3), life_span=7, value=1\n\nFor (6,3,10,1): (6,3), life_span=10, value=1\n\nAll have value=1, so all are positive food with reward +1, and different life spans.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 49, life_span is given, so for (4,2), life_span=1, so it disappears after this turn or next? \"Disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo for food at (4,2) with life_span=1 at turn 49, it will disappear after turn 49, meaning it can be eaten on turn 49, but not on turn 50.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) life_span=4, so it will disappear after turn 52, etc.\n\nValue is all +1, so all are positive food.\n\nOkay, that makes sense.\n\nNow, snake positions: head at (3,2), moving down (D), so from (3,2), possible moves: U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse. Since current direction is D, reverse is U, so cannot move U next. Also, cannot move into walls or body, but body collision: head touches body segment except tail, but tail is special.\n\nCore rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, moving into the tail cell is safe because the tail moves away.\n\nAlso, food under body can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves there.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid.\n\nPlayable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSo (4,6) is blocked.\n\nFood locations:\n\n- (4,2): life_span=1, value=1\n\n- (6,2): life_span=4, value=1\n\n- (1,3): life_span=7, value=1\n\n- (6,3): life_span=10, value=1\n\nAll positive.\n\nSnake: segments: (3,2) head, (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3) tail.\n\nSo let's list the body cells for collision check.\n\nBody cells: (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)\n\nTail is at (6,3), which is also a body segment, but moving to it is ok if possible.\n\nNow, head at (3,2), direction D.\n\nPossible moves from (3,2):\n\n- U: to (3,3) but (3,3) is a body segment, and not the tail? Tail is at (6,3), so (3,3) is a body segment, so moving to (3,3) would be collision, since head touches body, and it's not the tail cell? (3,3) is occupied by the second segment, which is not the tail, so it would be collision if head moves there.\n\nCore rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).\" But exception for tail: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment\"\n\nSo, moving to a cell occupied by the tail is safe, but to other body segments is deadly.\n\nHere, (3,3) is the second segment, not tail, so moving U to (3,3) is collision, death.\n\n- D: to (3,1). (3,1) is within bounds? x=3, y=1. y=1 is not wall, walls y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is playable. No obstacle at (3,1), and not occupied by body? Body positions: all have y>=2 or 3, (3,1) not in list, so free? Snake positions start from y=2 to y=5, so (3,1) is empty, no body, no wall, so D to (3,1) is possible.\n\n- L: to (2,2). x=2, y=2. Within bounds, not wall, not in body positions? Body: (3,3), (4,3), etc., (2,2) not listed, so free.\n\n- R: to (4,2). (4,2) is a food position. But is it occupied by body? Snake positions don't have (4,2), head is at (3,2), so (4,2) is food, not body. So moving to (4,2) is possible, and since it's food, eating it.\n\nBut we need to check if it's under body or something? (4,2) is not occupied by snake body, it's free with food, so moving head there eats it.\n\nFood at (4,2) has life_span=1, so it will disappear after this turn, so must be eaten now or never.\n\nSimilarly, other food.\n\nNow, current direction is D, so reverse is U, which is not allowed, so cannot move U anyway.\n\nPossible actions: D, L, R.\n\nU is invalid because reverse and also collision.\n\nNow, we need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible moves and consequences.\n\nOption 1: Move D to (3,1)\n\n- Head moves to (3,1), no food there, so snake doesn't grow, tail moves away. Tail is at (6,3), when snake moves, tail moves to the next segment? Snake movement: head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front, so tail moves to where the second last segment was.\n\nCurrent positions: let's index them: S0: (3,2) head, S1: (3,3), S2: (4,3), S3: (5,3), S4: (5,4), S5: (4,4), S6: (4,5), S7: (5,5), S8: (6,5), S9: (6,4), S10: (6,3) tail.\n\nAfter move D: head moves to (3,1), so new head: (3,1)\n\nThen S1 moves to S0 old position (3,2)\n\nS2 moves to S1 old (3,3)\n\nS3 to S2 old (4,3)\n\nS4 to S3 old (5,3)\n\nS5 to S4 old (5,4)\n\nS6 to S5 old (4,4)\n\nS7 to S6 old (4,5)\n\nS8 to S7 old (5,5)\n\nS9 to S8 old (6,5)\n\nS10 tail moves to S9 old (6,4)\n\nNew tail is at (6,4) or something. The segments: new positions: head (3,1), then (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)\n\nS10 was tail at (6,3), but it moved to S9 old, which is (6,4) before move? S9 was (6,4), so tail moves to (6,4), but (6,4) is now occupied by the new segment that was S9.\n\nThe new snake: after head moves to (3,1), the body segments shift: the segment that was S1 is now at (3,2), S2 at (3,3), ..., up to S9 at (6,5), and S10 (tail) moves to where S9 was, which is (6,4).\n\nS9 was at (6,4) before move, so after move, S10 moves to (6,4), but S9 moves to S8 old position (6,5)? Let's list:\n\nBefore move: positions: S0: (3,2), S1: (3,3), S2: (4,3), S3: (5,3), S4: (5,4), S5: (4,4), S6: (4,5), S7: (5,5), S8: (6,5), S9: (6,4), S10: (6,3)\n\nAfter head moves to (3,1):\n\n- New S0: (3,1)\n\n- S1 moves to old S0: (3,2)\n\n- S2 moves to old S1: (3,3)\n\n- S3 moves to old S2: (4,3)\n\n- S4 moves to old S3: (5,3)\n\n- S5 moves to old S4: (5,4)\n\n- S6 moves to old S5: (4,4)  // S5 was (4,4)? No, S5 is (4,4), but old S5 position is (4,4), but S6 moves to where S5 was, which is (4,4)\n\nStandard: each segment i moves to the position of segment i-1 from previous state.\n\nAfter head move, the body segments: segment k moves to where segment k-1 was.\n\nFor k from 1 to 10, segment k moves to position of segment k-1 from before the move.\n\nSo:\n\n- Segment 1 (was S1) moves to old S0 position: (3,2)\n\n- Segment 2 (was S2) moves to old S1 position: (3,3)\n\n- Segment 3 (was S3) moves to old S2 position: (4,3)\n\n- Segment 4 (was S4) moves to old S3 position: (5,3)\n\n- Segment 5 (was S5) moves to old S4 position: (5,4)  // old S4 was (5,4)? S4 was (5,4), so segment 5 moves to (5,4)\n\nOld positions:\n\nS0: (3,2)\n\nS1: (3,3)\n\nS2: (4,3)\n\nS3: (5,3)\n\nS4: (5,4)\n\nS5: (4,4)\n\nS6: (4,5)\n\nS7: (5,5)\n\nS8: (6,5)\n\nS9: (6,4)\n\nS10: (6,3)\n\nAfter head move to (3,1):\n\n- New head: (3,1)\n\n- Segment 1 (old S1) moves to old S0: (3,2)\n\n- Segment 2 (old S2) moves to old S1: (3,3)\n\n- Segment 3 (old S3) moves to old S2: (4,3)\n\n- Segment 4 (old S4) moves to old S3: (5,3)\n\n- Segment 5 (old S5) moves to old S4: (5,4)  // old S4 was (5,4), so to (5,4)\n\n- Segment 6 (old S6) moves to old S5: (4,4)  // old S5 was (4,4)\n\n- Segment 7 (old S7) moves to old S6: (4,5)  // old S6 was (4,5)\n\n- Segment 8 (old S8) moves to old S7: (5,5)  // old S7 was (5,5)\n\n- Segment 9 (old S9) moves to old S8: (6,5)  // old S8 was (6,5)\n\n- Segment 10 (old S10, tail) moves to old S9: (6,4)  // old S9 was (6,4)\n\nSo new snake: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)\n\nTail is at (6,4)\n\nNo food eaten, so length same, 11 segments.\n\nNew head position (3,1), direction D.\n\nFood at (4,2) has life_span=1 at turn 49, so after this turn, it disappears, so not eaten.\n\nOther food: (6,2) life_span=4, (1,3) life_span=7, (6,3) life_span=10.\n\n(6,3) is currently occupied by tail, but tail moves away, so after this move, (6,3) is empty? Old tail was at (6,3), and it moved to (6,4), so (6,3) is now free, and food at (6,3) is still there with life_span=10.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) is free, etc.\n\nBut for now, move D to (3,1) is safe, no immediate risk.\n\nOption 2: Move L to (2,2)\n\nHead to (2,2), no food there, so no eat.\n\nThen new snake: head (2,2), then S1 to old S0 (3,2), S2 to old S1 (3,3), ..., same as before but head at (2,2).\n\nNew positions: (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)  // tail to old S9 (6,4)\n\nTail at (6,4)\n\nHead at (2,2), direction L.\n\nSafe.\n\nOption 3: Move R to (4,2)\n\n(4,2) has food with value=1, life_span=1.\n\nSo eating it, snake grows: head moves to (4,2), eats food, so new head at (4,2), and the tail does not move, so snake gains a segment.\n\nAfter eating, the tail stays, so new segments: head at (4,2), then S1 to old S0 (3,2)? Standard: when eating, head moves to food, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so tail doesn't move.\n\nCore rules: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food.\n\nSo, head moves to (4,2), eats food, then the body segments: S1 moves to old S0 (3,2), S2 to old S1 (3,3), ..., up to S10 moves to old S9 (6,4), and a new segment is added at the old tail position (6,3), so new tail at (6,3).\n\nNew snake: (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)  // 12 segments.\n\nHead at (4,2), direction R.\n\nNow, (4,2) was food, eaten.\n\nBut (4,2) is also the position where the head is, and it was not under body, so ok.\n\nNow, we need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, there is a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nHere, for move to (4,2), tail is at (6,3), not adjacent, so no issue.\n\nAdjacent means one cell away, like (dx=1 and dy=0) or (dx=0 and dy=1), etc.\n\nHead at (3,2), tail at (6,3), distance |3-6| + |2-3| = 3+1=4, not adjacent.\n\nSo safe to eat.\n\nBut now, life_span of (4,2) is 1, so if not eaten now, it disappears, so we should consider eating it since it's a free point.\n\nBut we need to think long-term.\n\nAlso, other food: (6,2) life_span=4, so can be eaten later; (1,3) life_span=7; (6,3) life_span=10.\n\n(6,3) is currently occupied by tail, so it can be eaten only after tail moves away.\n\nNow, let's think about the board and possible paths.\n\nFirst, the snake is long, 11 segments, in a 6x6 grid, so space is tight.\n\nPlayable area: 6x6=36 cells, minus obstacle at (4,6), so 35 cells. Snake has 11, so 24 free cells, but with food.\n\nBut walls reduce, but x1-6,y1-6, 36 cells, minus (4,6) obstacle, 35 cells.\n\nSnake 11, so 24 free, including food positions.\n\nFood at (4,2), (6,2), (1,3), (6,3)\n\n(6,3) is occupied by tail, so not free yet.\n\nNow, for turn 49, we need to choose action.\n\nAlso, after move, the direction changes, so for next moves, we need to consider no reverse.\n\nNow, to maximize score, we should eat food when possible, but avoid risks.\n\n(4,2) will disappear after this turn, so if we don't eat it now, we lose it.\n\nBut is it safe to eat?\n\nIf we move R to (4,2), we eat it, grow to 12.\n\nThen head at (4,2), direction R.\n\nPossible next moves: from (4,2), direction R, so cannot move L (reverse).\n\nPossible moves: U, D, R.\n\nNow, cells around: (4,3) is body? New snake has (4,2) head, then (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), etc., so (4,3) is a body segment (the fourth segment).\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) is free? Not in snake positions, and not wall, so free.\n\n(4,1) down, etc.\n\nBut let's think 5 turns ahead.\n\nSince we need to output actions for multiple turns? The answer format is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it says \"action on turn t1\", \"action on turn t1+1\", so for multiple turns, but how many? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but the output should be for the current turn and future turns? The format is \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to plan a sequence.\n\nBut the state may change with food disappearing, so I need to simulate.\n\nAlso, the food life span decreases each turn.\n\nAt turn 49, food:\n\n- (4,2): life_span=1, disappears after turn 49, so can be eaten only on turn 49.\n\n- (6,2): life_span=4, disappears after turn 52? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 49, life_span=4, after turn 49, life_span=3, ..., after turn 52, it disappears, so can be eaten on turns 49,50,51,52.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3): life_span=7 at turn 49, can be eaten on turns 49 to 55.\n\n(6,3): life_span=10 at turn 49, can be eaten on turns 49 to 58.\n\nBut (6,3) is occupied by tail now, so not accessible until tail moves.\n\nIf we move R to (4,2) on turn 49, we eat it, grow to 12.\n\nThen on turn 50, head at (4,2), direction R.\n\nFrom (4,2), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (4,3) - but (4,3) is a body segment (the fourth segment in new snake), so collision, death. Invalid.\n\n- D: to (4,1) - free? (4,1) is within bounds, not wall, not in body positions, so possible.\n\n- R: to (5,2) - free? Not in snake, not wall, so possible.\n\n- L: to (3,2) - but (3,2) is the second segment, body, so collision, and also reverse, but since direction is R, L is reverse, not allowed anyway.\n\nSo possible: D to (4,1) or R to (5,2).\n\nIf move D to (4,1): no food, so snake moves, tail moves away.\n\nNew head at (4,1), direction D.\n\nThen body shifts, tail at new position.\n\nIf move R to (5,2): no food there, so move, grow not, tail moves.\n\n(5,2) is free, no food.\n\nFood at (6,2) is there, but not eaten.\n\nThen head to (5,2), direction R.\n\nNow, let's consider not eating (4,2) and moving elsewhere.\n\nFor example, move D to (3,1).\n\nTurn 49: move D to (3,1), no eat, snake same length, head at (3,1), direction D.\n\nThen on turn 50, from (3,1), direction D, so cannot move U (reverse).\n\nPossible moves: D to (3,0) but y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nL to (2,1) - free? (2,1) not wall, not body, possible.\n\nR to (4,1) - free, possible.\n\nU: reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo L or R.\n\nSimilarly, if we move L to (2,2) on turn 49, head at (2,2), direction L.\n\nThen turn 50, from (2,2), direction L, cannot move R.\n\nPossible: U to (2,3), D to (2,1), L to (1,2).\n\n(2,3) is body? In current state, (2,3) not occupied, but after move, let's see.\n\nAfter move L to (2,2) on turn 49, new snake: (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)\n\nSo (2,3) is free, (2,1) free, (1,2) free.\n\nSo all possible.\n\nBut we need to think about eating the food at (4,2) which expires now.\n\nIf we don't eat it, we lose +1 score.\n\nBut is it worth the risk?\n\nMoving to (4,2) might lead to a dead end.\n\nFor example, after eating at (4,2), head at (4,2), then we can only move D or R.\n\nIf we move D to (4,1), then head at (4,1), direction D.\n\nThen turn 51, from (4,1), direction D, cannot move U.\n\nPossible: D to (4,0) wall, invalid; L to (3,1); R to (5,1).\n\n(3,1) and (5,1) are free.\n\nSay move L to (3,1), then head (3,1), direction L.\n\nThen turn 52, from (3,1), direction L, cannot move R.\n\nPossible: U to (3,2), but (3,2) is body? Let's keep track of snake positions.\n\nAfter turn 49: move R to (4,2), eat, new snake: (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)\n\nHead at (4,2), direction R.\n\nTurn 50: move D to (4,1), no food, so move, no grow.\n\nHead to (4,1), then S1 to old S0 (4,2)? Old S0 is (4,2), so segment 1 moves to (4,2)\n\nSegment 2 moves to old S1 (3,2)\n\nSegment 3 to old S2 (3,3)\n\nSegment 4 to old S3 (4,3)\n\nSegment 5 to old S4 (5,3)\n\nSegment 6 to old S5 (5,4)\n\nSegment 7 to old S6 (4,4)\n\nSegment 8 to old S7 (4,5)\n\nSegment 9 to old S8 (5,5)\n\nSegment 10 to old S9 (6,5)\n\nSegment 11 to old S10 (6,4)\n\nTail was at (6,3), moves to old S10 (6,4)\n\nNew snake: head (4,1), then (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)\n\nTail at (6,4)\n\nHead at (4,1), direction D.\n\nTurn 51: from (4,1), direction D, cannot move U.\n\nPossible moves:\n- D to (4,0) wall, invalid\n- L to (3,1) - free\n- R to (5,1) - free\n\nSay move L to (3,1), no food.\n\nHead to (3,1), then body shifts.\n\nNew head (3,1), S1 to (4,1), S2 to (4,2), etc., tail to new position.\n\nThen head at (3,1), direction L.\n\nTurn 52: from (3,1), direction L, cannot move R.\n\nPossible: U to (3,2) - but (3,2) is now a body segment? In current snake, after turn 51, positions include (3,2)? From above, after turn 51 move to (3,1), snake: (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)  // tail at (6,4) moved to old S11 or something, but let's not digress.\n\nPoint is, (3,2) is body, so U to (3,2) collision.\n\nD to (3,0) wall.\n\nL to (2,1) - free.\n\nSo only L to (2,1) possible.\n\nThen it might be ok, but the snake is getting closer to the bottom left.\n\nSimilarly, if we had moved R from (4,1) to (5,1), similar.\n\nBut back to turn 50, from (4,2), we could move R to (5,2).\n\nTurn 49: move R to (4,2), eat, snake: (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)\n\nHead at (4,2), direction R.\n\nTurn 50: move R to (5,2), no food, so move, no grow.\n\nHead to (5,2), then S1 to (4,2), S2 to (3,2), S3 to (3,3), etc., tail to (6,4) or something.\n\nNew snake: head (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)  // tail at (6,4)\n\n(6,3) is gone, tail moved.\n\nHead at (5,2), direction R.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (5,3) - body segment (sixth segment), collision.\n\nD to (5,1) - free\n\nL to (4,2) - body, collision and reverse\n\nR to (6,2) - food at (6,2), value=1, life_span=4 at turn 49, at turn 50 life_span=3, so can be eaten.\n\n(6,2) is free, not body.\n\nSo move R to (6,2) possible, eat food.\n\nThen grow, head to (6,2), new segment at tail, so snake longer.\n\nBut then head at (6,2), which is near wall x=6, y=2.\n\nWalls at x=7, so x=6 is ok, but x=6, y=2.\n\nPossible moves from (6,2): U, D, L, R, but direction R, so cannot move L.\n\nR to (7,2) wall, invalid.\n\nU to (6,3) - but (6,3) has food with life_span=10, but is it occupied? In current snake, after turn 50 move to (5,2), snake has (6,4) and (6,5), not (6,3), so (6,3) is free with food.\n\nD to (6,1) free.\n\nL to (5,2) body, collision.\n\nSo possible U to (6,3) or D to (6,1).\n\nIf move U to (6,3), eat food there, grow.\n\nBut we need to see if it's safe.\n\nFirst, let's consider not eating (4,2) at turn 49.\n\nMove D to (3,1) on turn 49.\n\nHead to (3,1), direction D.\n\nSnake: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)  // tail at (6,4)\n\n(6,3) is now free with food.\n\nTurn 50: from (3,1), direction D, cannot move U (reverse and also wall if down).\n\nPossible moves: L to (2,1) or R to (4,1).\n\nSay move L to (2,1), no food.\n\nHead to (2,1), direction L.\n\nSnake: (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)  // tail at (6,4) moved to (6,5)? Old S10 was (6,4), moved to old S9 (6,5), so tail at (6,5).\n\nHead at (2,1), direction L.\n\nTurn 51: from (2,1), direction L, cannot move R.\n\nPossible: U to (2,2), D to (2,0) wall, L to (1,1).\n\n(2,2) is free, (1,1) free.\n\nFood at (1,3) is there.\n\nMove U to (2,2), no food.\n\nHead to (2,2), direction U.\n\nThen turn 52, from (2,2), direction U, cannot move D.\n\nPossible: U to (2,3), L to (1,2), R to (3,2).\n\n(2,3) is free, (1,2) free, (3,2) is body? In snake, (3,2) is second segment, so body, collision if move to (3,2).\n\nSo U or L.\n\nIf move L to (1,2), no food.\n\nThen head at (1,2), direction L.\n\nThen can go to (1,3) to eat food.\n\nBut let's see the big picture.\n\nThe grid has an obstacle at (4,6), so top-right is blocked.\n\nAlso, the snake is coiled, and we need to avoid dead ends.\n\nPerhaps we should eat the expiring food at (4,2) since it's free and we can.\n\nBut after eating, we grow, which might make it harder to maneuver.\n\nBut we have other food to eat.\n\nAnother thing: food at (6,3) is under the tail now, but tail will move.\n\nAt turn 49, tail at (6,3), food at (6,3), so it's under body, can be eaten only if head moves there after body moves away.\n\nIn this case, when tail moves, it reveals the food.\n\nIn move D or L on turn 49, tail moves away from (6,3), so on turn 50, (6,3) is free with food, can be eaten.\n\nSimilarly, in move R to (4,2), tail also moves away, so (6,3) free.\n\nIn all cases, after turn 49, (6,3) is free.\n\nNow, let's list the food life:\n\nTurn 49: (4,2) must be eaten now or lost.\n\n(6,2) can be eaten turns 49-52\n\n(1,3) turns 49-55\n\n(6,3) turns 49-58\n\nSince (4,2) expires now, and it's safe to eat, we should eat it to get the point.\n\nThen, after eating, we have options.\n\nBut let's think about the tail reward danger.\n\nFor example, if we go to (6,3) later, but tail is not adjacent, so should be ok.\n\nAnother risk: the internal obstacle at (4,6), but we are at bottom, so not immediate.\n\nPerhaps we can plan a path to eat multiple food.\n\nFor instance, from (4,2), after eating, move R to (5,2) on turn 50, then to (6,2) on turn 51 to eat that food, then from (6,2) move U to (6,3) to eat that food, but (6,3) has food.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nTurn 49: move R to (4,2), eat (4,2), snake grow to 12, head at (4,2), direction R.\n\nTurn 50: move R to (5,2), no food, so move, no grow. Head to (5,2), direction R. Snake: (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)  // tail at (6,4)\n\n(6,2) has food, not eaten yet.\n\nHead at (5,2), direction R.\n\nTurn 51: move R to (6,2), eat food at (6,2), grow to 13. Head to (6,2), new segment at tail, so tail at (6,4) stays, new snake: head (6,2), then (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4) and new tail segment at old tail position (6,4)? When eating, head moves to food, body shifts, new segment added at old tail position.\n\nAfter move to (6,2), eat, so new head (6,2), then segment 1 to old S0 (5,2), segment 2 to old S1 (4,2), segment 3 to old S2 (3,2), etc., up to segment 12 to old S11 (6,4), and new segment at old tail position, which was (6,4), so new tail at (6,4), but (6,4) is now occupied by segment 12, so new segment at (6,4), but that cell is taken, mistake.\n\nOld tail position before move: at turn 50, tail at (6,4).\n\nWhen head moves to (6,2), the body segments shift: segment 1 moves to old head (5,2), segment 2 to old segment 1 (4,2), ..., segment 12 moves to old segment 11 (6,4)? Let's index.\n\nAt turn 50, snake: S0: (5,2), S1: (4,2), S2: (3,2), S3: (3,3), S4: (4,3), S5: (5,3), S6: (5,4), S7: (4,4), S8: (4,5), S9: (5,5), S10: (6,5), S11: (6,4) tail.\n\nAfter move to (6,2) and eat: new head (6,2), then S1 moves to old S0 (5,2), S2 to old S1 (4,2), S3 to old S2 (3,2), S4 to old S3 (3,3), S5 to old S4 (4,3), S6 to old S5 (5,3), S7 to old S6 (5,4), S8 to old S7 (4,4), S9 to old S8 (4,5), S10 to old S9 (5,5), S11 to old S10 (6,5), and new segment S12 at old tail position (6,4).\n\nSo new snake: (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)\n\nHead at (6,2), direction R.\n\nNow possible moves:\n- U to (6,3) - (6,3) has food, and it's free, not body, so can eat.\n- D to (6,1) - free\n- L to (5,2) - body, collision\n- R to (7,2) wall, invalid\n\nSo U or D.\n\nIf move U to (6,3), eat food at (6,3), grow to 14.\n\nHead to (6,3), new segment at old tail (6,4).\n\nNew snake: head (6,3), then (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4) and new at (6,4), but (6,4) is occupied, problem.\n\nOld tail at (6,4), new segment at (6,4), but when adding, the cell might be free or not.\n\nIn this case, (6,4) is the position of the last body segment after shift.\n\nAfter moving head to (6,3), the body segments shift: S1 to old head (6,2), S2 to old S1 (5,2), ..., S12 to old S11 (6,5)? Let's list.\n\nTurn 51 before move: positions: S0: (6,2) head? No, at turn 51 after move to (6,2), we have positions as above for turn 51: S0: (6,2), S1: (5,2), S2: (4,2), S3: (3,2), S4: (3,3), S5: (4,3), S6: (5,3), S7: (5,4), S8: (4,4), S9: (4,5), S10: (5,5), S11: (6,5), S12: (6,4)  // S12 is tail at (6,4)\n\nNow turn 52: move U to (6,3), eat food, so new head at (6,3), then S1 moves to old S0 (6,2), S2 to old S1 (5,2), S3 to old S2 (4,2), S4 to old S3 (3,2), S5 to old S4 (3,3), S6 to old S5 (4,3), S7 to old S6 (5,3), S8 to old S7 (5,4), S9 to old S8 (4,4), S10 to old S9 (4,5), S11 to old S10 (5,5), S12 to old S11 (6,5), and new segment S13 at old tail position (6,4).\n\nSo new snake: (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)\n\nHead at (6,3), direction U.\n\nNow, the snake is clustered at bottom right, with head at (6,3), and body around.\n\nPossible moves: from (6,3), direction U, cannot move D.\n\nU to (6,4) - but (6,4) is now a body segment (last but one), so collision.\n\nD to (6,2) - body, collision.\n\nL to (5,3) - body, collision.\n\nR to (7,3) wall, invalid.\n\nAll moves deadly! Snake is trapped and will die.\n\nBecause after moving U to (6,3), the cell (6,4) is occupied by body, and (6,2) by body, (5,3) by body, so no escape.\n\nSo this path leads to death on turn 52.\n\nTherefore, eating (6,3) immediately after (6,2) is dangerous because the snake is too long and in a corner.\n\nIn this case, from (6,2), we should not move U to (6,3), but move D to (6,1) instead.\n\nThen from (6,2), move D to (6,1) on turn 52.\n\nTurn 51: at (6,2), move D to (6,1), no food there, so move, no grow.\n\nHead to (6,1), then body shifts, tail moves.\n\nNew snake: head (6,1), then (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)  // tail at (6,4) moved to old S12 (6,5) or something.\n\nTail at (6,5).\n\nHead at (6,1), direction D.\n\nThen turn 52, from (6,1), direction D, cannot move U.\n\nPossible: D to (6,0) wall, invalid; L to (5,1); R to (7,1) wall.\n\nSo only L to (5,1), free.\n\nThen can continue.\n\nBut we missed eating (6,3), but it has life_span=10, so can eat later.\n\nBut the point is, eating (4,2) and then going right might be ok if we avoid the corner.\n\nBack to turn 49, if we don't eat (4,2), we lose the point, but might have more space.\n\nFor example, move D to (3,1) on turn 49.\n\nHead to (3,1), direction D.\n\nThen turn 50, from (3,1), move say R to (4,1), no food.\n\nHead to (4,1), direction R.\n\nThen turn 51, from (4,1), can move U to (4,2), but (4,2) food expired, gone, so just move to (4,2), no food, or move to (3,1) body or (5,1).\n\n(4,2) is empty now, since food expired.\n\nSo move U to (4,2), free.\n\nBut no food.\n\nThen from there, we can go to eat other food.\n\nBut we lost the +1 from (4,2).\n\nSince all food is +1, eating it now is better than not, if safe.\n\nIn the earlier dangerous path, it was because we ate multiple food in corner, but we can avoid that.\n\nFor example, from turn 49, move R to (4,2), eat.\n\nThen turn 50, instead of R, move D to (4,1).\n\nHead to (4,1), direction D.\n\nThen turn 51, from (4,1), move L to (3,1) or R to (5,1).\n\nSay move L to (3,1), no food.\n\nHead to (3,1), direction L.\n\nThen turn 52, from (3,1), can only move L to (2,1) since U and D invalid or body/wall.\n\nMove to (2,1), then to (1,1), then to (1,2), then to (1,3) to eat food there.\n\nSimilarly, we can eat (1,3) later.\n\nBut the snake is long, might have issues.\n\nAnother idea: since (4,2) must be eaten now, and it's safe to do so, we should eat it.\n\nThen for the next moves, we can head towards the left to eat (1,3) or to the bottom.\n\nBut let's check if moving to (4,2) has any immediate risk.\n\nFrom (4,2), after eating, we can move D or R.\n\nMoving D to (4,1) seems safe, then from there we have options.\n\nMoving R to (5,2) also safe, but then from (5,2) we can go down or up, but up has body.\n\nFrom (5,2), we can move D to (5,1) or U to (5,3) but (5,3) is body, so only D or R, R to (6,2) to eat food there, but as before, might get stuck if we eat (6,3) immediately.\n\nBut we can eat (6,2) and then move down to (6,1) to avoid the corner.\n\nThen later go back to (6,3).\n\nBut (6,3) has long life, so no rush.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) has life 7, so time.\n\nSo for turn 49, I think we should eat the food at (4,2) by moving R.\n\nThen for turn 50, from (4,2), move D to (4,1) to avoid the right side for now.\n\nThen from (4,1), we can go left or right.\n\nSince the head is at (4,1), and direction D, we can move L to (3,1) or R to (5,1).\n\nThen we can go to the left to eat (1,3).\n\nLet's plan a sequence for 5 turns.\n\nTurn 49: move R to (4,2) to eat food.\n\nTurn 50: from (4,2), move D to (4,1)  // safe, no food\n\nTurn 51: from (4,1), direction D, move L to (3,1)  // safe, no food\n\nTurn 52: from (3,1), direction L, move L to (2,1)  // safe, no food\n\nTurn 53: from (2,1), direction L, move L to (1,1) or U to (2,2), etc.\n\nBut we need to eat food at (1,3), so from (2,1), move U to (2,2), then to (2,3) or (1,2), then to (1,3).\n\nBut (1,3) is at (1,3), which is near left wall.\n\nAlso, there is food at (6,2) and (6,3) on the right, but we can go later.\n\nSince we think 5+ turns, but the output should include multiple turns? The format is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't specify how many turns to output. It says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I think we need to provide a sequence, but how long?\n\nProbably for the immediate future, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", we should plan for at least 5 turns.\n\nBut the state changes, so we need to simulate.\n\nPerhaps for now, output the action for turn 49 and a few more.\n\nBut let's decide turn 49 first.\n\nI think eating (4,2) is beneficial and safe if we move down immediately.\n\nIf we don't eat, we lose the point, and the snake is still long.\n\nSo I'll go with move R for turn 49.\n\nThen for turn 50, move D from (4,2) to (4,1).\n\nThen turn 51, from (4,1), move L to (3,1) or R to (5,1).\n\nLet's say move L to (3,1) to go left.\n\nThen turn 52, from (3,1), move L to (2,1).\n\nTurn 53, from (2,1), move U to (2,2) to go towards (1,3).\n\nBut (1,3) is at y=3, so from (2,2), move U to (2,3) or L to (1,2), then to (1,3).\n\nWe can eat (1,3) on turn 54 or so.\n\nSimilarly, for the right food, we can circle back.\n\nBut let's not output too many turns; perhaps for the answer, output turn 49 to turn 53 or something.\n\nSince the food at (6,2) expires after turn 52, we might want to eat it soon.\n\nLife_span=4 at turn 49, so after turn 49, life_span=3, can be eaten until turn 52.\n\nTurn 52 is the last chance.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 53, it disappears.\n\nSo we need to eat it by turn 52.\n\nIn our plan, on turn 49 we are at (4,2), turn 50 at (4,1), turn 51 at (3,1), turn 52 at (2,1), far from (6,2), so we can't eat (6,2) in time.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf we move R to (5,2) on turn 50, then to (6,2) on turn 51.\n\nTurn 49: move R to (4,2) eat\n\nTurn 50: move R to (5,2) no eat\n\nTurn 51: move R to (6,2) eat (6,2), grow\n\nThen from (6,2), we can move D to (6,1) on turn 52, to avoid eating (6,3) immediately.\n\nThen later go to (6,3).\n\nBut (6,3) can be eaten later.\n\nSo for turn 49 to 51.\n\nAlso, for the sequence, we need to specify actions.\n\nBut for the answer, we can start with turn 49.\n\nI think for turn 49, move R to eat (4,2).\n\nThen for turn 50, move R to (5,2) to position for (6,2).\n\nThen turn 51, move R to (6,2) to eat (6,2).\n\nThen turn 52, from (6,2), move D to (6,1) to escape the corner.\n\nThen turn 53, from (6,1), move L to (5,1), etc.\n\nBut let's confirm if (6,2) can be eaten on turn 51.\n\nAt turn 51, life_span of (6,2): at turn 49, life_span=4, turn 50, life_span=3, turn 51, life_span=2, so yes, can be eaten on turn 51.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) is there.\n\nBut in this sequence, on turn 51 we eat (6,2), then on turn 52 move D to (6,1), safe.\n\nThen we can later go to (6,3) or other places.\n\nFor (1,3), life_span=7 at turn 49, turn 50:6, t51:5, t52:4, t53:3, t54:2, t55:1, so can be eaten until turn 55.\n\nPlenty of time.\n\nSo this seems good.\n\nIf we didn't eat (4,2), we could go to (6,2) directly, but from (3,2), move R to (4,2) is the way, but if we don't eat, we move to (4,2) without eating, but (4,2) has food, so if we move to (4,2), we eat it, we can't not eat if we move there.\n\nIf we move to a cell with food, we eat it automatically.\n\nSo to avoid eating, we must not move to (4,2).\n\nBut since it expires, better to eat.\n\nSo I think move R on turn 49.\n\nThen for the sequence.\n\nBut the head direction: after move R, direction is R.\n\nThen move R to (5,2), direction R.\n\nThen move R to (6,2), direction R.\n\nThen from (6,2), move D to (6,1), direction D.\n\nNow for the answer format.\n\nWe need to output actions for several turns.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", output for 5 turns: turn 49 to 53.\n\nTurn 49: R\n\nTurn 50: R\n\nTurn 51: R\n\nTurn 52: D  // from (6,2) to (6,1)\n\nTurn 53: from (6,1), direction D, can move L to (5,1) or U to (6,2) but (6,2) may have body, or D to (6,0) wall, so only L to (5,1).\n\nSay move L to (5,1).\n\nBut we don't have to specify all, but for consistency.\n\nSince the state changes, maybe output only turn 49 for now, but the format suggests multiple turns.\n\nI think we can provide a sequence.\n\nTo be safe, let's output for turn 49 and 50 at least.\n\nBut in the instruction, it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output for the current turn and future.\n\nFor this, I'll provide turn 49 to 53.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 49: R (to eat (4,2))\n\nTurn 50: R (to (5,2))\n\nTurn 51: R (to (6,2) eat (6,2))\n\nTurn 52: D (to (6,1) escape corner)\n\nTurn 53: L (to (5,1))\n\nBut on turn 52, after moving to (6,1), the snake position changes.\n\nSimilarly, on turn 53, from (6,1), move L to (5,1), etc.\n\nBut this is one possible path.\n\nPerhaps from turn 50, after (4,2), move D to (4,1), then to (3,1), etc., but then we miss (6,2) if not eaten by turn 52.\n\nWith the sequence above, we eat two food: (4,2) and (6,2), and avoid immediate death.\n\nThen from there, we can go to eat (1,3) or (6,3).\n\nBut for the output, I think this is fine.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\n### Analysis for Turn 49 Decision\n- **Current State Overview**:\n  - **Grid**: Playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 (borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls). Internal obstacle at (4,6).\n  - **Snake**: Head at (3,2) moving down (D). Body segments: [(3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)] (11 segments). Tail at (6,3).\n  - **Food**:\n    - (4,2): Value +1, life span 1 (disappears after turn 49; must be eaten now or lost).\n    - (6,2): Value +1, life span 4 (can be eaten on turns 49-52).\n    - (1,3): Value +1, life span 7 (can be eaten on turns 49-55).\n    - (6,3): Value +1, life span 10 (can be eaten on turns 49-58; currently under tail but will be accessible after tail moves).\n- **Immediate Moves from (3,2)**:\n  - **U (to (3,3))**: Invalid (body collision with segment at (3,3) and reverse move from current D direction).\n  - **D (to (3,1))**: Safe (empty cell, no collision risk).\n  - **L (to (2,2))**: Safe (empty cell, no collision risk).\n  - **R (to (4,2))**: Safe (eats positive food, no collision; tail at (6,3) is not adjacent, so no tail reward danger).\n\n**Decision Rationale for Turn 49**:\n- **Prioritize Eating (4,2)**: This food expires after turn 49 and provides +1 score with no immediate risk. Not eating it wastes a scoring opportunity.\n- **Long-Term Survival Consideration (5+ Turns)**:\n  - Eating (4,2) grows the snake to 12 segments, which increases the risk of collision in tight spaces. However, the grid has 35 playable cells (36 minus obstacle), and with 12 segments, 23 cells remain free—sufficient for maneuvering if we avoid corners.\n  - After eating (4,2), moving right toward (6,2) allows us to eat another +1 food before it expires (by turn 52). This path avoids the dangerous top-right area near (4,6) and the clustered body segments.\n  - Moving down (D) or left (L) on turn 49 avoids growth but loses the (4,2) food. It also delays accessing (6,2), which may not be reachable by turn 52 from the left/bottom, risking its loss.\n  - **Risk Assessment**: Moving right (R) on turn 49 is safe and sets up a sequence to eat (6,2) efficiently. From (6,2), moving down (D) to (6,1) on turn 52 avoids the corner trap at (6,3) (as eating (6,3) immediately after (6,2) could cause collision due to the snake's length and position).\n\n**Planned Sequence (Turns 49-53)**:\n- **Turn 49: Move R** to (4,2) to eat expiring food (+1 score, snake grows to 12 segments). Head direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 50: Move R** to (5,2) (empty cell, no growth). This positions the snake to reach (6,2) next turn. Head direction remains R.\n- **Turn 51: Move R** to (6,2) to eat food (+1 score, snake grows to 13 segments). Head direction remains R.\n- **Turn 52: Move D** to (6,1) (empty cell, no growth). This escapes the corner and avoids potential collision at (6,3). Head direction becomes D.\n- **Turn 53: Move L** to (5,1) (empty cell, no growth). This moves the snake away from walls and toward the center for future flexibility.\n\n**Why This Sequence?**:\n- **Score Maximization**: Eats two high-priority foods: (4,2) (expiring) and (6,2) (expiring soon), adding +2 score by turn 51.\n- **Survival Focus**: Avoids the top-right corner (risky due to obstacle and walls) and the (6,3) area until the snake can safely navigate it. Moving down on turn 52 prevents immediate trapping.\n- **Future Flexibility**: By turn 53, the snake is at (5,1) with options to pursue (1,3) or (6,3) later (both have long life spans). The path keeps the snake away from body clusters and walls.\n- **Collision Avoidance**: All moves comply with movement constraints (no reverse, no wall/body collisions). Tail reward danger is irrelevant here (tail not adjacent during food consumption).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 49: R (right)\nTurn 50: R (right)\nTurn 51: R (right)\nTurn 52: D (down)\nTurn 53: L (left)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 50, and the grid has walls. Border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There's also an internal obstacle at (4,6). So, the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but with walls on the borders and that one obstacle.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (4,2), then body segments: (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3). Let me list them in order:\n\n- Head: (4,2)\n\n- Segment 1: (3,2)\n\n- Segment 2: (3,3)\n\n- Segment 3: (4,3)\n\n- Segment 4: (5,3)\n\n- Segment 5: (5,4)\n\n- Segment 6: (4,4)\n\n- Segment 7: (4,5)\n\n- Segment 8: (5,5)\n\n- Segment 9: (6,5)\n\n- Segment 10: (6,4)\n\n- Segment 11: (6,3)\n\nThat's 12 segments, so the snake length is 12.\n\nSnake head direction is R, which is right, so moving east.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (6,2) with life span 3 and value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (1,3) with life span 6 and value 1 (positive)\n\n- (6,3) with life span 9 and value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food here. Value 1 and life span given.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including the current turn, so at turn 50, for (6,2), life span 3 means it will disappear after 3 more turns? Life span is the number of turns it will last, including the current turn, so it disappears after N turns from now.\n\nThe rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for food at (6,2) with life_span=3 at turn 50, it will be gone after turn 52? Let's clarify.\n\nIf at turn t, life_span=N, then:\n\n- After turn t, countdown decreases to N-1\n\n- After turn t+1, to N-2\n\n- ...\n\n- After turn t + N - 1, it becomes 1, and after that turn, it disappears? I think I need to think carefully.\n\nTypically, if life_span is N at turn t, it means it will disappear at the end of turn t + N - 1 or something. But the rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, countdown is N, at turn t+1, it's N-1, ..., at turn t + N - 1, it's 1, and then after that turn, it should be gone. So it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + N - 1.\n\nFor (6,2) at turn 50 with life_span=3, it can be eaten on turns 50, 51, 52, and disappears after turn 52.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) with life_span=6 at turn 50, can be eaten from turn 50 to 55, disappears after turn 55.\n\n(6,3) with life_span=9, from turn 50 to 58.\n\nNow, the snake head is at (4,2), moving right, so current direction is R.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, so the playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No.\n\nBorder cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So cells with x=0, any y; x=7, any y; y=0, any x; y=7, any x are walls. So the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Not exactly, because for example, (0,0) is corner, but since walls are lines, any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is wall, so the inner grid is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? Let's see coordinates.\n\nFor instance, snake head at (4,2), which is within 1 to 6 in x and y? x=4, y=2, y=2 is not y=0 or y=7, so it should be playable. y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to 6 should be playable? y=0 is wall, y=1 is not wall unless border, but border walls are only when x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, so for y, y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6 are free, similarly x from 1 to 6.\n\nBut there's an internal obstacle at (4,6), which is a wall.\n\n(4,6): x=4, y=6. y=6 is not y=7, so it should be free, but it's an obstacle, so it's a wall cell.\n\nSimilarly, borders: x=0, any y; x=7, any y; y=0, any x; y=7, any x are walls.\n\nInternal obstacle: (4,6) is wall.\n\nSo playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (4,6) is wall.\n\ny=1 to 6: y=1,2,3,4,5,6. But y=6 is the top row? Let's define: probably (0,0) bottom-left or top-left? Doesn't matter, but for consistency.\n\nAssume (0,0) is bottom-left, so y increases up, x increases right.\n\nIn the snake positions, head at (4,2), then (3,2), (3,3), etc., so y=2 and y=3, which are above y=0 and y=1.\n\ny=0 is bottom wall, y=7 is top wall. So y from 1 to 6 are the rows.\n\nSimilarly x from 1 to 6.\n\nBut (4,6) is an obstacle, so wall at (4,6).\n\nNow food: (6,2), (1,3), (6,3)\n\n(6,3) has food, but snake has a segment at (6,3)? Snake positions: let's list all snake cells.\n\nSnake: (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)\n\n(6,3) is the tail, I think. Positions: head (4,2), then (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3). So (6,3) is the last segment, the tail.\n\nBut food at (6,3) with value 1, life span 9.\n\nFood can spawn under the snake's body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) has food, which is adjacent to head? Head at (4,2), (6,2) is two cells to the right, but not adjacent directly.\n\nAdjacent cells to head: since head at (4,2), possible moves: up (4,3), down (4,1), left (3,2), right (5,2).\n\nBut current direction is R, so cannot instantly reverse to left, so possible actions: U, D, R (since L is opposite).\n\nCannot move opposite to current direction, which is R, so cannot move L to (3,2).\n\nNow, let's see what's around.\n\nFirst, immediate moves:\n\n- Up (U): to (4,3)\n\n- Down (D): to (4,1)\n\n- Right (R): to (5,2)\n\nNow, check for collisions or food.\n\nFirst, (4,3): is this a wall? x=4,y=3, not border, not (4,6), so free. But is it occupied by snake? Snake has segments: (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), etc. (4,3) is a body segment, index 3 in the list, so yes, occupied. If head moves to (4,3), it would collide with body.\n\nSimilarly, down to (4,1): y=1, which is not wall, since y=0 is wall, y=1 is free. Is (4,1) occupied? Snake positions: all y>=2, I think. (4,2), (3,2), etc., min y is 2, so (4,1) should be free. But is it within bounds? x=4,y=1, x between 1-6, y=1 between 1-6, yes.\n\ny=1 is not wall, since y=0 is wall, y=1 is row 1, free.\n\nSimilarly, right to (5,2): (5,2) is not in snake positions? Snake has (5,3), (5,4), etc., but (5,2) not listed, so free.\n\nNow food: food at (6,2), (1,3), (6,3)\n\n(6,3) is occupied by snake tail, so food is under it.\n\n(6,2) is free, I think.\n\n(1,3) free.\n\nFor (6,3), since it's occupied, can only be eaten if snake moves away and head comes later.\n\nNow, possible actions:\n\n- U to (4,3): but (4,3) is body segment, so collision, death. Not possible.\n\n- D to (4,1): free, no food, safe.\n\n- R to (5,2): free, no food, safe.\n\nNo food at (4,1) or (5,2), so no eating.\n\nBut we need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, tail at (6,3), and food under it.\n\nNow, life spans: (6,2) life span 3, so must be eaten by turn 52 or it disappears.\n\nTurn 50 now, so turns 50,51,52 to eat.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) life span 6, to turn 55.\n\n(6,3) life span 9, to turn 58.\n\nSnake head direction is R, so after moving, direction will be set to the new move.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves for multiple turns, at least 5 ahead.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n\nMake a grid, x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nBut only x=1 to 6, y=1 to6 playable except walls.\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (4,6).\n\nPlayable: (1,1) to (6,6) except (4,6) is wall.\n\n(4,6) is occupied by wall, so not accessible.\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (4,2)\n\nBody: (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)\n\nSo tail at (6,3)\n\nFood: (6,2), (1,3), (6,3) but (6,3) has food under snake.\n\n(6,3) has food, but snake is on it, so to eat, snake must move away first.\n\nNow, current turn 50, head at (4,2), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, R (since L not allowed, opposite).\n\nU to (4,3): occupied by snake, death. Invalid.\n\nSo only D to (4,1) or R to (5,2).\n\nBoth safe for now.\n\nNow, let's think about the food.\n\n(6,2) is close, at (6,2), which is one step right and down? From (4,2), to (5,2) is right, then to (6,2) is right again.\n\nFrom (4,2) to (5,2) is R, then from (5,2) to (6,2) is R again.\n\n(6,2) has food, value +1.\n\nBut it has short life, only until turn 52, so we need to eat it soon.\n\n(1,3) is far left, at (1,3).\n\n(6,3) has food under tail, so we need to move tail away first.\n\nTail is at (6,3), and when snake moves, tail moves only if no growth.\n\nSince we eat food, length increases.\n\nBut for now, no eating, so tail moves.\n\nPlan to eat (6,2) first since it's close and short life.\n\nBut need to avoid risks.\n\nAlso, the tail food at (6,3) might be dangerous to eat because of tail reward danger.\n\nTail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut here, food is under tail, so when we eat it, we need to be careful.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving to (5,2) or (4,1).\n\nOption 1: Move R to (5,2) on turn 50.\n\nThen head at (5,2), direction R.\n\nNow, from (5,2), possible moves: U to (5,3), D to (5,1), L to (4,2), R to (6,2).\n\nCurrent direction R, so cannot instantly reverse to L? Reverse would be opposite, L is left, which is opposite to R, so cannot move L to (4,2).\n\nSo possible: U, D, R.\n\nNow, (5,3): is it free? Snake has segment at (5,3), which is body, so occupied. Collision if move there.\n\n(5,1): should be free, y=1, not wall, not occupied? Snake all at y>=2 except after move, but positions will shift.\n\nAfter turn 50, if head moved to (5,2), the new positions: head (5,2), then previous head (4,2) becomes body, so body segments: (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3). But tail (6,3) will be removed if no growth, so new snake: head (5,2), body: (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4). Tail at (6,4).\n\nOriginal positions: before move, snake: [(4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3)]\n\nAfter move R to (5,2): head moves to (5,2), then the body: the segment that was at (4,2) moves to where head was? No.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in front, and tail is removed if no food eaten.\n\nSince no food eaten, tail is removed.\n\nSo new head: (5,2)\n\nThen body: the first body segment was (3,2), but it moves to the position of the old head (4,2)? Let's index.\n\nPositions list: index 0: head (4,2)\n\nIndex 1: (3,2)\n\nIndex 2: (3,3)\n\nIndex 3: (4,3)\n\nIndex 4: (5,3)\n\nIndex 5: (5,4)\n\nIndex 6: (4,4)\n\nIndex 7: (4,5)\n\nIndex 8: (5,5)\n\nIndex 9: (6,5)\n\nIndex 10: (6,4)\n\nIndex 11: (6,3) tail\n\nAfter moving head to (5,2), new head at (5,2)\n\nThen, the body segments: index 1 (3,2) moves to where index 0 was, (4,2)\n\nIndex 2 (3,3) moves to where index 1 was, (3,2)\n\nIndex 3 (4,3) moves to where index 2 was, (3,3)\n\nIndex 4 (5,3) moves to where index 3 was, (4,3)\n\nIndex 5 (5,4) moves to where index 4 was, (5,3)\n\nIndex 6 (4,4) moves to where index 5 was, (5,4)\n\nIndex 7 (4,5) moves to where index 6 was, (4,4)\n\nIndex 8 (5,5) moves to where index 7 was, (4,5)\n\nIndex 9 (6,5) moves to where index 8 was, (5,5)\n\nIndex 10 (6,4) moves to where index 9 was, (6,5)\n\nIndex 11 (6,3) moves to where index 10 was, (6,4)? But since no growth, the tail is removed, so we don't add a new segment.\n\nThe last segment, index 11, is not included, so the new tail is where index 10 was.\n\nNew positions: head (5,2)\n\nThen body: (4,2)  // old head position\n\nThen (3,2)  // old index1\n\nThen (3,3)  // old index2\n\nThen (4,3)  // old index3? Old index3 was (4,3), but it moves to old index2 position (3,3)\n\nList:\n\n- New head: (5,2)\n\n- New body segment 1: old head position (4,2)\n\n- New body segment 2: old body segment 1 position (3,2)\n\n- New body segment 3: old body segment 2 position (3,3)\n\n- New body segment 4: old body segment 3 position (4,3)\n\n- New body segment 5: old body segment 4 position (5,3)\n\n- New body segment 6: old body segment 5 position (5,4)\n\n- New body segment 7: old body segment 6 position (4,4)\n\n- New body segment 8: old body segment 7 position (4,5)\n\n- New body segment 9: old body segment 8 position (5,5)\n\n- New body segment 10: old body segment 9 position (6,5)\n\n- New body segment 11: old body segment 10 position (6,4)  // since tail removed, this is the last\n\nOld body segment 10 was (6,4), and it moves to old body segment 9 position (6,5)? I'm confusing myself.\n\nStandard: the body segments shift down the list.\n\nAfter move, the new body is the old body list without the last element, and each segment is in the position of the previous one, but since head moved, the first body segment takes the old head position.\n\nSo:\n\nNew snake positions:\n\n- Head: (5,2)\n\n- Segment 1: (4,2)  // old head\n\n- Segment 2: (3,2)  // old segment 1\n\n- Segment 3: (3,3)  // old segment 2\n\n- Segment 4: (4,3)  // old segment 3\n\n- Segment 5: (5,3)  // old segment 4\n\n- Segment 6: (5,4)  // old segment 5\n\n- Segment 7: (4,4)  // old segment 6\n\n- Segment 8: (4,5)  // old segment 7\n\n- Segment 9: (5,5)  // old segment 8\n\n- Segment 10: (6,5)  // old segment 9\n\n- Segment 11: (6,4)  // old segment 10\n\nOld segment 10 was (6,4), and it becomes the new tail at (6,4), but since tail was removed, we have one less segment? No.\n\nOriginal 12 segments: head + 11 body.\n\nAfter move with no growth: head moves to new position, body: the first body segment is at old head position, second at old first body position, ..., up to the second last body segment, and the tail is removed.\n\nSo new snake has head + 10 body segments? Let's count.\n\nOriginal: 12 positions.\n\nAfter move: new head at (5,2), then 11 positions from the old list except the tail is removed, so we have the old head to old segment 10 as new body.\n\nOld positions: 0: (4,2), 1: (3,2), 2: (3,3), 3: (4,3), 4: (5,3), 5: (5,4), 6: (4,4), 7: (4,5), 8: (5,5), 9: (6,5), 10: (6,4), 11: (6,3)\n\nAfter head move to (5,2), new head (5,2)\n\nThen new body: segment 1: old position 0: (4,2)\n\nSegment 2: old position 1: (3,2)\n\nSegment 3: old position 2: (3,3)\n\nSegment 4: old position 3: (4,3)\n\nSegment 5: old position 4: (5,3)\n\nSegment 6: old position 5: (5,4)\n\nSegment 7: old position 6: (4,4)\n\nSegment 8: old position 7: (4,5)\n\nSegment 9: old position 8: (5,5)\n\nSegment 10: old position 9: (6,5)\n\nSegment 11: old position 10: (6,4)\n\nOld position 11 (6,3) is removed, so no new segment for it. So new snake has 12 segments? Head + 11 body, but we removed the tail, so it should be 11 segments total.\n\nOriginal: 12 segments.\n\nAfter move with no growth: head moves to new cell, so we add a new head position, and the tail position is removed, so the snake has the same number of segments, but the tail is cut off.\n\nSo new positions: head at new position, then each body segment at the position of the previous segment in the list.\n\nSo for new body, it is the old head position for the first body segment, then old body positions for the rest, except the last one is omitted.\n\nSo new: head (5,2)\n\nBody: (4,2)  // old head\n\n(3,2)  // old body1\n\n(3,3)  // old body2\n\n(4,3)  // old body3\n\n(5,3)  // old body4\n\n(5,4)  // old body5\n\n(4,4)  // old body6\n\n(4,5)  // old body7\n\n(5,5)  // old body8\n\n(6,5)  // old body9\n\n(6,4)  // old body10\n\nAnd old body11 (6,3) is gone.\n\nSo new tail at (6,4)\n\nLength still 12? 1 head + 11 body = 12 segments, same as before.\n\nBut since no growth, length should stay the same, so yes, 12 segments.\n\nPositions: head (5,2), then (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4) tail.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, food at (6,2) is still there.\n\nBack to turn 50 decision.\n\nIf we move R to (5,2), then on turn 51, head at (5,2), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,3), D to (5,1), R to (6,2)\n\nL to (4,2) is opposite to current direction R, so not allowed.\n\n(5,3): in new positions, (5,3) is occupied by body segment (5,3), which is the fifth segment in new list, so if move U to (5,3), collision.\n\nD to (5,1): should be free, y=1, not wall, not occupied.\n\nR to (6,2): (6,2) has food, and it is free, not occupied by snake.\n\nSo on turn 51, if at (5,2), we can move R to (6,2) to eat the food.\n\nThen, eating (6,2), so length increases, tail does not move.\n\nAfter eating, new head at (6,2), and tail stays, so new segment added.\n\nBut we need to see if it's safe.\n\n(6,2) is not adjacent to tail or something.\n\nTail is at (6,4), not adjacent to (6,2).\n\n(6,2) and (6,4) are two cells apart, with (6,3) in between, but (6,3) has food under it, but currently occupied.\n\nIf we eat (6,2) on turn 51, then it's fine.\n\nBut let's sequence.\n\nFirst, on turn 50, move R to (5,2).\n\nThen on turn 51, from (5,2), move R to (6,2) to eat food.\n\nThen, after that, head at (6,2), direction R.\n\nThen snake grows, so new positions: head (6,2), body: (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4) and since eaten, tail stays, so (6,3) is still there? No.\n\nAfter eating, the tail is not removed, so the old tail remains.\n\nBefore eating on turn 51, at start of turn 51, positions: head (5,2), body (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4) tail.\n\nAfter moving head to (6,2) and eating, new head (6,2), body: (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4) and since eaten, a new segment is added at the tail position, which is (6,4), so tail becomes (6,4) and new segment at (6,4)? No.\n\nWhen eating, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the current tail position, so the tail doesn't move, and the new tail is the same as before, but since we add a segment, the snake grows.\n\nPositions: after move, head to new position, then the body segments move as usual, but since food eaten, the tail is not removed, so the last position is kept.\n\nIn this case, from positions before move: head (5,2), body (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)\n\nMove head to (6,2), so new head (6,2)\n\nThen body segments: first body to old head position (5,2)\n\nSecond body to old first body position (4,2)\n\nAnd so on, up to the last body segment to the second last position.\n\nSince food eaten, no tail removal, so new positions: head (6,2), then (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4) and the old tail (6,4) is still there, but we add a new segment at the position where the tail was, so the new tail is at (6,4), and the segment before is (6,5).\n\nList: new head (6,2)\n\nNew body segment 1: old head position (5,2)\n\nNew body segment 2: old body1 position (4,2)\n\nNew body segment 3: old body2 position (3,2)\n\nNew body segment 4: old body3 position (3,3)\n\nNew body segment 5: old body4 position (4,3)\n\nNew body segment 6: old body5 position (5,3)\n\nNew body segment 7: old body6 position (5,4)\n\nNew body segment 8: old body7 position (4,4)\n\nNew body segment 9: old body8 position (4,5)\n\nNew body segment 10: old body9 position (5,5)\n\nNew body segment 11: old body10 position (6,5)\n\nNew body segment 12: old tail position (6,4)  // since eaten, tail not removed, so new segment added at old tail position.\n\nSo new tail at (6,4), and length 13.\n\nNow, food at (6,2) is eaten, so removed.\n\nBut there is food at (6,3) under the snake, but now snake has segments at (6,5), (6,4), and (6,3) is not occupied? In new positions, (6,3) is not in the list, so it should be free, but food is there.\n\n(6,3) has food, and it is not occupied by snake now, since tail is at (6,4), and (6,3) is free.\n\nSo the food at (6,3) is now accessible, since snake moved away.\n\nOn turn 51 after eating (6,2), head at (6,2), direction R.\n\nNow, possible moves from (6,2): U to (6,3), D to (6,1), L to (5,2), R to (7,2) but x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n\nL to (5,2) is left, current direction R, so opposite, cannot instantly reverse.\n\nD to (6,1): y=1, not wall.\n\nU to (6,3): (6,3) has food, and it is free now.\n\n(6,3) is not in new snake positions, so yes.\n\nSo can move U to (6,3) to eat the food there.\n\nBut there is tail reward danger?\n\nTail is at (6,4), and if head moves to (6,3), which is adjacent to tail (6,4), and (6,3) has food, so if we eat it, we might have collision.\n\nTail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because after eating, the tail grows and occupies the cell where head was, but since head is adjacent, it might collide.\n\nSpecifically, when you eat the food, the new tail segment is added at the current tail position, so if head is adjacent to tail, after eating, the new head is on the food cell, and the new tail is at the old tail position, which is adjacent to the new head, so they are adjacent, but not necessarily colliding unless the head moves into the tail cell.\n\nCollision happens if head moves to a cell occupied by body.\n\nIn this case, if head moves to (6,3), which is free, no problem. After eating, the snake grows, new head at (6,3), new body includes (6,2), (5,2), etc., and new tail at (6,4), and since (6,3) and (6,4) are adjacent, but head is at (6,3), tail at (6,4), no collision because tail is not head.\n\nCollision only if head touches any body segment except the tail, but tail is part of body, but when you can move into the tail cell because the tail moves.\n\nIn general, it's safe to move to the tail cell because the tail will move away.\n\nBut in this case, for eating, if the food is under the tail or something.\n\nTail reward danger specifically: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nSo here, if head moves to (6,3), which is adjacent to tail at (6,4), and the cell (6,3) has food, so if we eat it, after eating, head is at (6,3), and the new tail segment is added at the old tail position (6,4), so the cell (6,4) now has a body segment, and head is at (6,3), adjacent, but not colliding.\n\nCollision would happen only if head moves to a cell that will be occupied after the move.\n\nBut after eating, the new head is at (6,3), and the body includes (6,4), which is adjacent, but (6,4) is not the head, so no collision. Head at (6,3), body at (6,2), (5,2), ..., and (6,4), etc.\n\n(6,4) is a body segment, and (6,3) is head, so they are adjacent, but since it's not the same cell, no collision.\n\nThe danger might be that after growth, the head is next to the tail, but that's fine.\n\nThe rule says: \"eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nI think I misread.\n\n\"the head and newly grown tail will collide\" – but the newly grown tail is at the old tail position, and head is on the food cell, which was adjacent to old tail.\n\nBut after moving, head is at food cell, which might be adjacent to the new tail position.\n\nIn this case, if head moves to (6,3), old tail at (6,4), so after eating, new head at (6,3), new tail at (6,4) (since new segment added there), so they are adjacent cells, no collision.\n\nCollision only if they occupy the same cell.\n\nPerhaps the issue is that when you eat, the tail doesn't move, so if the food cell was adjacent to tail, after eating, head is on food, tail is on its cell, adjacent, but not same cell.\n\nBut the rule says \"collide\", which might mean occupying the same cell.\n\nLet's read carefully: \"the head and newly grown tail will collide.\" But they are different cells.\n\nPerhaps it's a misunderstanding.\n\nAnother part: \"because the head and newly grown tail will occupy adjacent positions or something?\"\n\nNo, collision is head touching body.\n\nPerhaps in the context, if the head moves to a cell that is the tail cell, but the tail cell has food, and head moves to it, then after eating, the tail grows to where it was, but since head moved to tail cell, it might be that the tail was there, but head moves to it, so before move, tail is at (6,4), head moves to (6,3), not to tail cell.\n\nI think for tail reward danger, it's when the food is on the tail cell, and head moves to it while adjacent.\n\nLet's see the rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nSuppose tail at position P with food on P. Head is adjacent to P. If head moves to P to eat the food, then after eating, new head at P, and since food eaten, a new segment is added at the old tail position P, but P is now occupied by head, so the new segment is added at P, but head is already there, so collision.\n\nYes, that's it.\n\nWhen you eat the food on the tail cell, you move head to the tail cell, which is occupied by tail, so it's a collision, because before moving, the tail cell is occupied.\n\nIn general, you can only move to free cells or the tail cell, because the tail will move.\n\nBut if the tail cell has food, and you move to it, you are moving to a cell that is occupied (by tail), but normally, moving to tail cell is allowed because tail moves away.\n\nHowever, if there is food on it, and you eat it, then after moving, head is at P, and since you ate, the tail doesn't move, so the cell P now has both head and the new segment? No.\n\nSequence:\n\n- Before move: tail at P with food underneath.\n\n- Head moves to P: since P is occupied by tail, it's a collision, but in snake games, moving to the tail cell is allowed because the tail will move, so it's not a collision if you are moving to the tail cell and it's the only overlap.\n\nBut when there is food, it's special.\n\nThe rule says: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nSo for food under tail, the body must move away first, then head can move onto it.\n\nIn this case, for (6,3), it was under tail, so we cannot eat it immediately; we need the tail to move away first.\n\nIn our earlier plan, when we moved to (6,2), the tail was at (6,4), and (6,3) is free with food, so we can move to (6,3) to eat it, and since it's not the tail cell, and not occupied, it should be fine.\n\nBut tail is at (6,4), adjacent to (6,3), but not the same cell.\n\nSo moving to (6,3) should be safe to eat.\n\nNo tail reward danger here because the food is not on the tail cell; it's on a free cell adjacent to tail.\n\nTail reward danger only when food is on the tail cell and head moves to it while adjacent.\n\nHere, food is at (6,3), tail is at (6,4), different cells.\n\nSo on turn 51, after moving to (5,2), we can move R to (6,2) to eat food, then on turn 52, from (6,2), we can move U to (6,3) to eat the other food.\n\nBut (6,3) has life span 9, so no rush.\n\nFirst, let's complete the move sequence.\n\nBack to turn 50.\n\nOption: move D to (4,1)\n\nThen head at (4,1), direction down.\n\nThen possible moves from there.\n\nBut (6,2) has short life, so if we move down, we might not get to eat (6,2) in time.\n\n(6,2) must be eaten by turn 52.\n\nTurn 50: if we move D to (4,1), then on turn 50, no food eaten.\n\nTurn 51: from (4,1), we can move, say, R to (5,1) or U to (4,2) or D to (4,0) but y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nCurrent direction D, so cannot instantly reverse to U.\n\nPossible: L, R, D but D to (4,0) wall, so only L to (3,1) or R to (5,1).\n\nThen to get to (6,2), it might take more turns.\n\nFor example, from (4,1) to (5,1) to (6,1) to (6,2), but on turn 51, if at (4,1), move R to (5,1), then turn 52, from (5,1) move R to (6,1), then turn 53 move U to (6,2), but turn 53 is after turn 52, (6,2) disappears after turn 52, so on turn 53 it's gone, cannot eat. Turn 52 is the last chance.\n\n(6,2) can be eaten on turns 50,51,52.\n\nIf we don't eat on turn 50 or 51, we must eat on turn 52.\n\nBut from turn 50 position, if we move D to (4,1), then on turn 51, we can move to (5,1), for example.\n\nThen on turn 52, head at (5,1), we need to move to (6,2).\n\nFrom (5,1), possible moves: U to (5,2), D to (5,0) wall, L to (4,1), R to (6,1).\n\nCurrent direction, if we moved R to (5,1) on turn 51, direction R.\n\nThen on turn 52, possible moves: U, D, R.\n\nU to (5,2), D to (5,0) invalid, R to (6,1).\n\n(6,2) is not directly accessible from (5,1); we need to go to (6,1) first or (5,2).\n\nBut (6,2) is at (6,2), from (5,1), we can move U to (5,2) or R to (6,1).\n\nThen from (5,2) we can move R to (6,2), or from (6,1) move U to (6,2).\n\nBut on turn 52, if we are at (5,1), we move to, say, (5,2) or (6,1), but not directly to (6,2) in one move.\n\nFrom (5,1), (6,2) is not adjacent; adjacent cells are (5,2), (5,0), (4,1), (6,1). (6,2) is up-right, not adjacent directly. So we need two moves to reach (6,2) from (5,1), but we only have one move on turn 52 to reach it, impossible. So if we are not at (5,2) or (6,1) on turn 52, we cannot reach (6,2) on turn 52.\n\nTo be at (6,2) on turn 52, we need to be at an adjacent cell on turn 51: (6,1), (6,3), (5,2), or (7,2) but wall.\n\n(7,2) invalid, so only (6,1), (6,3), (5,2).\n\nOn turn 51, if we are at one of these, we can move to (6,2) on turn 52.\n\nBut from turn 50, if we move D to (4,1), on turn 51 we can move to (5,1) or (3,1), not to (5,2) or (6,1) or (6,3) directly.\n\nFrom (4,1), on turn 51, we can move to (5,1) or (3,1), both not adjacent to (6,2).\n\nThen on turn 52, from (5,1) or (3,1), we can only move to cells like (5,2) or (6,1), but not directly to (6,2), so we miss the chance to eat (6,2) on turn 52.\n\nSimilarly, if we move to (3,1), worse.\n\nSo if we move down on turn 50, we cannot eat (6,2) at all, since we can't reach it on turn 50 or 51, and on turn 52 we can't get there from the positions.\n\nThus, to eat (6,2), we must move right on turn 50 to (5,2), then on turn 51 move to (6,2) to eat it.\n\nThat seems necessary.\n\nOtherwise, we lose the food.\n\nNow, the other food at (1,3) has longer life, and (6,3) also.\n\nBut (6,3) is now accessible after we move.\n\nSo let's plan to move R on turn 50 to (5,2).\n\nThen on turn 51, move R to (6,2) to eat the food.\n\nNow, after that, head at (6,2), direction R.\n\nThen on turn 51, after eating, positions as before.\n\nNow for turn 52, head at (6,2), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,3), D to (6,1), L to (5,2), R to (7,2) invalid.\n\nL to (5,2) is left, current direction R, opposite, so cannot move L.\n\nSo only U, D, R but R invalid, so U or D.\n\n(6,3) has food, and it is free, so we can move U to (6,3) to eat it.\n\nD to (6,1) also possible.\n\nBut eating (6,3) is good, value +1.\n\nAlso, life span 9, plenty, but we can eat now.\n\nIs there danger?\n\nTail is at (6,4), adjacent to (6,3).\n\nIf we move to (6,3), head to tail-adjacent cell with food.\n\nAfter eating, new head at (6,3), and new segment added at old tail (6,4), so head at (6,3), body includes (6,4), which is adjacent, but not collision.\n\nNo tail reward danger because food not on tail cell.\n\nSo safe to eat.\n\nWe can do that.\n\nThen after eating, snake grows to 14 segments? Original 12, ate two, so 14.\n\nBut let's not count.\n\nThen after turn 52, head at (6,3), direction U (since moved up).\n\nThen we can think about (1,3) or other.\n\nBut (1,3) is far, at x=1,y=3.\n\nWe need to navigate.\n\nAlso, the internal wall at (4,6).\n\nNow, to maximize score, we should eat all food, but prioritize survival.\n\nBut (1,3) has life span until turn 55, so we have time.\n\nAfter being at (6,3), we can move to other areas.\n\nBut let's think about the sequence for multiple turns.\n\nFirst, on turn 50: move R to (5,2)\n\nTurn 51: move R to (6,2) eat food\n\nThen on turn 52: move U to (6,3) eat food\n\nNow, after turn 52, head at (6,3), direction U.\n\nPositions: before move on turn 52, head at (6,2), body as after turn 51.\n\nAfter turn 51: head at (6,2), body: (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4) tail? After turn 51, we ate (6,2), so positions: head (6,2), body (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4) and since eaten, tail not removed, so (6,4) is body, and we have segments.\n\nLength 13.\n\nThen on turn 52, move U to (6,3) to eat (6,3).\n\n(6,3) has food, so eat.\n\nAfter move: head to (6,3), new head (6,3)\n\nBody: old head position (6,2), old body positions except tail not removed.\n\nNew body: (6,2) // old head\n\nThen (5,2) // old body1\n\n(4,2) // old body2\n\n(3,2) // old body3\n\n(3,3) // old body4\n\n(4,3) // old body5\n\n(5,3) // old body6\n\n(5,4) // old body7\n\n(4,4) // old body8\n\n(4,5) // old body9\n\n(5,5) // old body10\n\n(6,5) // old body11\n\n(6,4) // old tail, but since eaten, new segment added at old tail position (6,4)\n\nOld tail was at (6,4), so new segment at (6,4)\n\nSo new positions: head (6,3), body: (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)  // new tail at (6,4)\n\nLength 14.\n\nNow, head at (6,3), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,4), D to (6,2), L to (5,3), R to (7,3) invalid.\n\nD to (6,2) is down, current direction U, so opposite, cannot instantly reverse to D.\n\nL to (5,3) is left, not opposite to U, so possible.\n\nU to (6,4), R invalid.\n\nSo possible: U, L.\n\n(6,4) is now a body segment, the tail? In new positions, (6,4) is the tail, but since it's the tail, we can move to it, because tail will move.\n\n(6,4) is occupied by tail, but moving to tail cell is allowed.\n\n(5,3) is body segment, not tail, occupied, so if move to (5,3), collision.\n\n(5,3) is body, index in body, not tail.\n\nIn positions, (5,3) is a body segment, so if head moves to (5,3), it collides.\n\nSimilarly, U to (6,4): (6,4) is tail, so can move to it.\n\nL to (5,3): occupied, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is U to (6,4).\n\nThen, since we move to tail cell, no collision, tail moves away.\n\nAfter move, no food eaten, since (6,4) has no food? Food was at (6,3), eaten, so (6,4) might not have food.\n\nNo food mentioned, so no eat.\n\nMove U to (6,4), head to (6,4), direction U.\n\nThen body shifts, tail removed.\n\nNew head (6,4), body: (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), etc., tail at (6,5) or something.\n\nBut we don't care for now.\n\nNow, the remaining food is at (1,3), which we need to eat by turn 55.\n\nCurrent turn after turn 52 is turn 53? Let's track turns.\n\nTurn 50: move R\n\nTurn 51: move R, eat at (6,2)\n\nTurn 52: move U, eat at (6,3)\n\nNow turn 53: head at (6,3), but after move on turn 52, head at (6,3), but we just moved U to (6,4) on turn 53?

Current turn: after turn 54, it's turn 55? Let's see the turn sequence.\n\nTurn 50: action\n\nTurn 51: action\n\nTurn 52: action\n\nTurn 53: action\n\nTurn 54: action\n\nAfter turn 54, it's the end of turn 54, so for turn 55, we are at head (6,5).\n\n(1,3) can be eaten on turn 55.\n\nBut from (6,5) to (1,3) is far, we cannot reach in one move.\n\nDistance: x from 6 to 1, y from 5 to 3, so at least 5 moves away, impossible to reach on turn 55.\n\nBut (1,3) life span 6 at turn 50, so can be eaten turns 50 to 55, disappears after turn 55? Turn 50: life_span=6, so countdown: turn 50: 6, turn 51:5, turn 52:4, turn 53:3, turn 54:2, turn 55:1, so can be eaten on turn 55, and after turn 55, it disappears, so turn 55 is the last chance.\n\nBut from (6,5) on turn 55, we cannot reach (1,3) in one move; it's too far.\n\nTherefore, we missed the opportunity to eat (1,3) because we went to the right and up.\n\nIn our initial choice, by moving right on turn 50, we ate the right food but couldn't reach the left food in time.\n\nIf we had moved down on turn 50, we might have been able to go left.\n\nBut earlier, if we move down on turn 50 to (4,1), we couldn't eat (6,2), and (6,2) would be lost.\n\n(6,2) has short life, so we must eat it.\n\nBut (1,3) also needs to be eaten by turn 55.\n\nOn turn 50, head at (4,2), if we move down to (4,1), then we can start heading left.\n\nFor example, turn 50: move D to (4,1), direction D.\n\nThen turn 51: from (4,1), cannot move U (opposite), so move L to (3,1) or R to (5,1).\n\nSay move L to (3,1), direction L.\n\nThen turn 52: from (3,1), possible moves D to (3,0) wall, U to (3,2), L to (2,1), R to (4,1).\n\nCurrent direction L, so cannot R (opposite).\n\nSo U, L, D but D invalid, so U or L.\n\n(3,2) is occupied by snake? After moves.\n\nAfter turn 50: head to (4,1), body: (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), etc., tail.\n\n(3,2) is body, so U to (3,2) occupied, collision.\n\nL to (2,1) free.\n\nSo move L to (2,1).\n\nThen turn 53: from (2,1), move to (1,1) or (2,2) or (2,0) invalid or (3,1).\n\nCurrent direction L, so cannot R to (3,1)? Opposite not allowed, so can move U, D, L.\n\nD to (2,0) invalid, so U to (2,2) or L to (1,1).\n\n(2,2) may be free.\n\nThen to get to (1,3), we need to go up.\n\nBut on turn 55, we might be able to reach (1,3).\n\nFor example, turn 53: from (2,1), move U to (2,2) or L to (1,1).\n\nSay move L to (1,1), direction L.\n\nThen turn 54: from (1,1), move to (1,2), (1,0) invalid, (0,1) wall, (2,1).\n\nCurrent direction L, so cannot R to (2,1) opposite.\n\nU to (1,2), D invalid, L invalid (x=0 wall), so only U to (1,2).\n\nThen turn 55: from (1,2), move to (1,3) to eat.\n\n(1,3) has food, and should be free.\n\nSo we can eat on turn 55.\n\nSimilarly, if we move other ways.\n\nBut we didn't eat (6,2), which disappeared.\n\nSo we have a trade-off: eat (6,2) and miss (1,3), or miss (6,2) and eat (1,3).\n\nSince all food is +1, we should eat as many as possible.\n\n(6,2) and (1,3) both +1, but (6,2) has shorter life, so if we don't eat it, we lose it, whereas (1,3) we might reach if we go left.\n\nBut in the first case, by going right, we ate two food: (6,2) and (6,3), but missed (1,3).\n\nBy going down/left, we can eat (1,3) but miss (6,2) and possibly (6,3).\n\n(6,3) has longer life, so we might eat it later.\n\nFor example, if we go to (1,3) by turn 55, then we can go back to (6,3) later, since life span until turn 58.\n\nBut the snake is long, and grid is small, we might have space issues.\n\nLet's see the grid occupation.\n\nAfter turn 50, if we move D to (4,1), then we can go left to eat (1,3) by turn 55.\n\nThen for (6,3), we can go to it after.\n\nBut need to avoid colliding with body.\n\nSince we ate (1,3), snake grows, more body.\n\nBut possible.\n\nTo maximize, we should eat both (6,2) and (1,3), but (6,2) requires us to be at (5,2) or (6,1) or (6,3) on turn 51 to eat on turn 52.\n\nOn turn 50, if we move R to (5,2), then on turn 51 we can eat (6,2).\n\nThen from (6,2), we can go down or left to reach (1,3).\n\nBut from (6,2) on turn 51, to (1,3) by turn 55.\n\nDistance: x from 6 to 1, y from 2 to 3, so dx=5, dy=1, min moves 6, but we have turns 51,52,53,54,55: 5 moves.\n\nFrom (6,2) to (1,3): we need to go left 5 steps, and up 1 step, but not necessarily straight.\n\nFor example, move left multiple times.\n\nBut the body might block.\n\nOn turn 51 after eating (6,2), head at (6,2), body as before.\n\nThen we need to go west.\n\nPossible moves from (6,2): U to (6,3), D to (6,1), L to (5,2), but L to (5,2) is opposite to current direction R? After moving to (6,2), direction is R.\n\nSo on turn 51, after move to (6,2), direction R.\n\nThen on turn 52, possible moves: U, D, R but R invalid, so U or D.\n\nIf U to (6,3), we can eat (6,3), but then we are at (6,3), even farther.\n\nIf D to (6,1), then to (5,1), etc.\n\nBut to reach (1,3) in 4 moves (turns 52,53,54,55), from (6,1) or (6,3).\n\nFrom (6,1) to (1,3): dx=5, dy=2, min moves 7? Not possible in 4 moves.\n\nFrom (6,2) to (1,3): dx=5, dy=1, min moves 6, but we have only 4 moves to turn 55? Turns: on turn 52, we move from (6,2) to some cell, then turn 53,54,55.\n\nAfter turn 55 move, we are at a cell, and we eat on that cell if it has food.\n\nSo to eat on turn 55, we need to be at (1,3) on turn 55 after move.\n\nSo we need to arrive at (1,3) on turn 55.\n\nFrom (6,2) on turn 51, after move.\n\nOn turn 52, we move to a cell, say A.\n\nTurn 53 to B, turn 54 to C, turn 55 to (1,3).\n\nSo 4 moves to go from (6,2) to (1,3).\n\nThe Manhattan distance is |6-1| + |2-3| = 5 + 1 = 6, which is greater than 4, so impossible to reach (1,3) in exactly 4 moves with Manhattan distance 6? Manhattan distance is the shortest path, but due to obstacles or body, it might be longer, but in open grid, min moves is 6, which is more than 4, so impossible to reach (1,3) by turn 55 if we are at (6,2) on turn 51.\n\nTherefore, if we go to (6,2) on turn 51, we cannot reach (1,3) by turn 55.\n\nThus, we must choose: either eat (6,2) and (6,3), or eat (1,3) and possibly (6,3) later.\n\nSince (6,2) has short life, we should eat it, and sacrifice (1,3), as (1,3) is far and we might not have time anyway if we don't go left immediately.\n\nMoreover, (6,3) we can eat easily.\n\nIn the first plan, we ate two food, missed one.\n\nIf we go left, we eat one food, miss one.\n\nSo better to eat two.\n\nAlso, (6,3) is still there.\n\nBut in the left plan, we can eat (1,3) and then (6,3).\n\nFor example, on turn 50, move D to (4,1)\n\nThen turn 51, move L to (3,1)  (assume we go left)\n\nBut (3,2) is occupied, so from (4,1), we can move L to (3,1) or R to (5,1).\n\nMove L to (3,1), direction L.\n\nThen turn 52, from (3,1), cannot U to (3,2) occupied, so move L to (2,1), direction L.\n\nThen turn 53, from (2,1), move L to (1,1), direction L.\n\nThen turn 54, from (1,1), move U to (1,2), direction U (since moved up)\n\nThen turn 55, from (1,2), move U to (1,3) to eat.\n\nYes, eat (1,3) on turn 55.\n\nThen snake grows.\n\nNow, (6,3) has food until turn 58, so we can go to it.\n\nFrom (1,3), we can move right, but the body is trailing, so we need to find a path.\n\nFor example, after eating (1,3), head at (1,3), then we can move to (2,3), (1,4), etc., and go to (6,3).\n\nBut (6,3) might be eaten later.\n\nSince we didn't eat (6,2), it disappeared.\n\nSo we ate one food (1,3), missed (6,2).\n\nIn the right plan, we ate two: (6,2) and (6,3), missed (1,3).\n\nSo net, eating two is better than one.\n\nMoreover, in the right plan, we are at (6,5) on turn 55, and (6,3) is eaten, so no food there anymore.\n\n(6,3) eaten on turn 52.\n\nSo only (1,3) missed.\n\nThus, better to go for the right food.\n\nFor the answer, we need to output the actions for multiple turns, at least 5 ahead.\n\nThe question is to output from turn t1 to t1+4 or something.\n\nCurrent turn t1=50.\n\nWe need to output actions for turn 50,51,52,53,54, etc., but probably a few turns.\n\nSince we think ahead, but output the sequence.\n\nIn the right plan, on turn 50: R\n\nTurn 51: R\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nThen after that, we can continue.\n\nBut for the answer, we need to specify the actions.\n\nAlso, on turn 53 and 54, we moved U, but that was to avoid dead end, but we can choose other paths.\n\nIn the earlier, from (6,2) after eating, on turn 52, we could move D to (6,1) instead of U to (6,3), but then we might not eat (6,3) immediately, but it has long life.\n\nBut to go to (1,3), it's impossible, so we might as well eat (6,3).\n\nThen after that, we are at top-right, and we can explore or just survive.\n\nBut since no other food, we need to avoid walls and body.\n\nBut for now, let's output the first few turns.\n\nSo for turn 50: move R to (5,2)\n\nTurn 51: move R to (6,2) eat\n\nTurn 52: move U to (6,3) eat\n\nThen for turn 53: from (6,3), direction U, we moved U to (6,4)\n\nBut we could move L to (5,3) if possible, but (5,3) is occupied.\n\nIn positions after turn 52, head at (6,3), body (6,2), (5,2), etc., (5,3) is body, so cannot move L.\n\nOnly U or D, but D opposite if direction U, so only U.\n\nSimilarly, later.\n\nSo the sequence is forced for a few turns.\n\nTo have more control, on turn 52, after at (6,2), instead of moving U to (6,3), we could move D to (6,1).\n\nThen from there, we can go down and left, but (1,3) is too far, cannot reach by turn 55.\n\nFor example, turn 52: from (6,2) move D to (6,1), direction D.\n\nThen turn 53: from (6,1), move L to (5,1) or D to (6,0) invalid, U to (6,2), but U opposite if direction D? Current direction D, so cannot U.\n\nL or R or D invalid, so L to (5,1).\n\nThen turn 54: to (4,1), etc., but to (1,3) still far.\n\nNo point, since cannot eat (1,3).\n\nSo better to eat (6,3) on turn 52.\n\nThus, the plan is:\n\nTurn 50: R\n\nTurn 51: R\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nThen for turn 53, we have to move U to (6,4)\n\nTurn 54: U to (6,5)\n\nThen on turn 55, at (6,5), we can move U to (6,6) or L to (5,5)\n\nBut we need to output up to turn 54 or 55?\n\nThe answer format should include a few turns, but since it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but output the actions starting from t1.\n\nProbably output for t1, t1+1, ..., for 5 turns or so.\n\nIn the box.\n\nAlso, for the internal wall at (4,6), we need to avoid it.\n\nBut in our path, we are at (6,5), moving up.\n\n(6,6) is free, but y=6, then above is y=7 wall.\n\nSo from (6,5) move U to (6,6), then from (6,6), possible moves D or L, since U to (6,7) invalid.\n\nBut we can go left.\n\nBut no food, so just survive.\n\nSince the question is to maximize score, and we ate two food, it's fine.\n\nTo output the actions.\n\nSo for turn 50: R\n\nTurn 51: R\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nThen turn 53: U (to (6,4))\n\nTurn 54: U (to (6,5))\n\nBut on turn 53, from (6,3) move U to (6,4)\n\nTurn 54 from (6,4) move U to (6,5)\n\nThen turn 55 from (6,5) move U to (6,6) or L to (5,5)\n\nBut for the answer, we can output up to turn 54.\n\nSince t1=50, output turns 50 to 54 or 55.\n\nThe format says: \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so probably multiple.\n\nI think 5 actions are sufficient.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 50: R\n\nTurn 51: R\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nBut on turn 53 and 54, U is the only choice, but we can write it.\n\nTo make it shorter, but I think it's fine.\n\nIn the beginning, on turn 50, we could move D, but that misses (6,2), so worse.\n\nSo the sequence is reasonable.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating available positive food while ensuring long-term survival, the AI must prioritize eating the food at (6,2) due to its short remaining life span (must be eaten by turn 52). The current state at turn 50 shows the snake head at (4,2) moving right (R), with food at (6,2), (1,3), and (6,3). All food is positive (+1 value), but (6,2) has only 3 turns left (including turn 50) before it disappears after turn 52. The food at (1,3) has 6 turns left (must be eaten by turn 55), and (6,3) has 9 turns left (must be eaten by turn 58). However, given the snake's position and the need to avoid collisions, eating (1,3) is not feasible within the time frame if the snake prioritizes (6,2), as the Manhattan distance from the right side to (1,3) is too great.\n\nThe snake must eat (6,2) immediately to avoid losing it. Moving right (R) on turn 50 to (5,2) sets up the snake to eat (6,2) on turn 51. After eating (6,2), the snake can then eat (6,3) on turn 52, as it becomes accessible and has a longer life span. The sequence for turns 50–54 is planned below, considering movement constraints (no instant reverse) and collision avoidance. The snake grows by 2 segments after eating two food items, but the grid has space to maneuver safely in the short term.\n\n### Key Considerations for 5+ Turns Ahead:\n- **Turn 50:** Move right (R) to (5,2) to approach (6,2). Down (D) to (4,1) is safe but misses (6,2), leading to lower score.\n- **Turn 51:** Move right (R) to (6,2) to eat the food. This must be done now, as (6,2) disappears after turn 52.\n- **Turn 52:** Move up (U) to (6,3) to eat the food there. (6,3) is now free (snake body moved away), and eating it is safe (no tail reward danger, as the food is not on the tail cell).\n- **Turn 53:** From (6,3) with direction U, moving up (U) to (6,4) is the only safe option (left to (5,3) causes collision, down is reverse and not allowed).\n- **Turn 54:** From (6,4) with direction U, moving up (U) to (6,5) is the only safe option (down is reverse, left to (5,4) causes collision).\n\nBeyond turn 54, the snake is at (6,5) and can move to (6,6) or (5,5) on turn 55, but with no immediate food, the focus shifts to survival. Eating (1,3) by turn 55 is impossible from this position due to distance, but the two food eaten (score +2) outweigh the loss of (1,3) (score +1) compared to alternative paths. The sequence ensures no collisions or wall hits.\n\n### Action Sequence (Turns 50 to 54):\n\\boxed{\nTurn 50: R (right)  \nTurn 51: R (right)  \nTurn 52: U (up)  \nTurn 53: U (up)  \nTurn 54: U (up)  \n}",

So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but with walls on the edges and that obstacle.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (5,2), and the body segments follow: (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4). Let me list them in order:\n\n1. Head: (5,2)\n\n2. (4,2)\n\n3. (3,2)\n\n4. (3,3)\n\n5. (4,3)\n\n6. (5,3)\n\n7. (5,4)\n\n8. (4,4)\n\n9. (4,5)\n\n10. (5,5)\n\n11. (6,5)\n\n12. Tail: (6,4)\n\nSo the snake has 12 segments. Head direction is R, meaning right, so last move was to the right.\n\nNow food:\n\n- (6,2) with life span 2, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (1,3) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (6,3) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive; no negative food here.\n\nI need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks. Priority is long-term survival.\n\nCurrent head position: (5,2), direction R.\n\nPossible moves from here: since head direction is R, I can go U (up), D (down), or R (right), but not L (left) because that would be instant reverse. No instant reverse rule: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is R, so I can't go L immediately.\n\nSo options: U, D, R.\n\nNow, let's see what each move does.\n\nFirst, if I go R to (6,2). (6,2) has food! But let's check if it's safe.\n\n(6,2) is a food position with life span 2, value 1.\n\nBut is there any danger?\n\nFirst, collision check: walls. x=7 is wall, so (6,2) is not a wall, since x=6 <7, y=2 between 0 and 7. Internal obstacle is (4,6), not here. So no wall.\n\nNow, body collision: snake body positions. List all occupied cells:\n\nFrom positions: (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)\n\n(6,2) is not in this list, so moving to (6,2) should be safe for now.\n\nBut when I move, the snake grows only if I eat food. If I eat food at (6,2), since it's positive, length increases by 1.\n\nThe food at (6,2) has life span 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns, including current? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So on turn 51, life span is 2, so after turn 51, it decreases to 1, then after turn 52, it disappears. So it will be gone after turn 52.\n\nIf I move to (6,2) on this turn (turn 51), I eat it immediately.\n\nNow, after moving to (6,2), the head is at (6,2), and since I ate food, a new segment is added where the tail was? No.\n\nStandard snake movement: when snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the next position, and if no food eaten, tail is removed. If food eaten, tail stays, so length increases.\n\nIn this case, if I eat food at (6,2), then after move, head is at (6,2), and the body segments shift: the previous head (5,2) becomes body, and so on, down to the tail. Since food eaten, tail doesn't move, so a new segment is added at the tail position? No.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nCurrent positions: head at (5,2), then body segments.\n\nAfter moving right to (6,2):\n\n- New head: (6,2)\n\n- Then the first body segment is now the old head (5,2)\n\n- Then (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), and tail (6,4) remains because food eaten? No.\n\nWhen food is eaten, after the move, the tail does not retract; it stays, so the snake grows by one segment.\n\nSo sequence:\n\n- Move head to new position (6,2)\n\n- Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n\n- Since food eaten, the last segment (tail) is not removed; instead, it stays, and a new segment is added? No, the tail position remains occupied.\n\nStandard: after eating, the tail doesn't move, so the length increases by one.\n\nFor example, positions before move: [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nAfter moving to a food cell: new positions [new_H, H, B1, B2, ..., T] because the tail doesn't advance, so T stays, and all segments shift.\n\nIn terms of cells: head was at P0, moves to P_new.\n\nThen body segments: segment 1 was at P1, moves to P0; segment 2 was at P2, moves to P1; ... segment k was at Pk, moves to P_{k-1}; and since food eaten, the tail segment at Pk remains, so now there is an additional segment at Pk.\n\nIn list form: new head at new_pos, then old head position, then old body positions except the tail stays.\n\nEasier: the new position list is [new_head] + old_positions_list.\n\nBecause the tail is not removed.\n\nSo in this case, before move: positions = [(5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)]\n\nAfter moving to (6,2) and eating food: new positions = [(6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)]\n\nThe tail (6,4) is still there, and (6,5) is now part of body.\n\nNow, (6,4) was tail, still there, so the snake is longer.\n\nNow, back to move: if I go to (6,2), it has food, so I eat it, grow to 13 segments.\n\nBut is there any risk? Tail reward danger? Tail reward danger is when head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food; eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (6,4). Head moving to (6,2). Are they adjacent? (6,2) and (6,4) are not adjacent; they are two units apart vertically. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up/down/left/right.\n\n(6,2) and (6,4) have y difference 2, so not adjacent. Tail is at (6,4), head to (6,2), distance is |2-4|=2, so not adjacent. So no issue.\n\nMoreover, (6,2) is empty now? No, after move, but at the moment of move, (6,2) is food, not body, so safe to move.\n\nAfter move, head at (6,2), which was food, now it's head.\n\nNow, other moves: U or D.\n\nIf I go U to (5,3). (5,3) is a body segment! Current positions: (5,3) is the 6th segment, I think. List: index 0: (5,2), 1: (4,2), 2: (3,2), 3: (3,3), 4: (4,3), 5: (5,3), 6: (5,4), etc.\n\n(5,3) is position of segment 5, which is body, not head. So moving to (5,3) would be collision with body, death.\n\nSimilarly, D to (5,1): y=1, but walls: y=0 is wall, so (5,1) is not wall? Borders: y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 to 6 are free, except obstacles.\n\n(5,1): x=5, y=1. Walls: border cells x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. So (5,1) has y=1, not 0, so not wall. Internal obstacle (4,6), not here. So (5,1) is empty? But is it occupied by snake?\n\nSnake positions: all listed, (5,1) not in list, so empty. But let's confirm: positions are (5,2), (4,2), etc., no (5,1), so (5,1) is free.\n\nBut if I go D to (5,1), that would be down, from (5,2) to (5,1).\n\nBut head direction is R, so moving D is allowed, not opposite.\n\nBut (5,1) is empty, no food there, I think? Food is at (6,2), (1,3), (6,3), no (5,1), so moving to (5,1) doesn't eat food, just move.\n\nThen after move, head to (5,1), body shifts, tail removed since no food eaten.\n\nSimilarly, going U to (5,3) is impossible because it's occupied by body.\n\nSo from current position, possible moves: R to (6,2) or D to (5,1). U to (5,3) is body, collision. L to (4,2) is body and also opposite direction? Direction is R, so L is opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo only R and D are possible.\n\nR to (6,2) with food, D to (5,1) no food.\n\nNow, if I go R, I eat food, grow to 13 segments, head at (6,2).\n\nIf I go D, head to (5,1), no growth, snake moves, tail at (6,4) is removed, so positions: new head (5,1), then (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5). Tail was (6,4), removed, so (6,5) is new tail? Old positions: after head moves to (5,1), body: segment 1 moves to old head (5,2), segment 2 to (4,2), ..., segment 11 to (6,5), and tail removed, so new positions: [(5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)] with 12 segments, same length.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n\nFirst, let's consider going for the food at (6,2) since it's close and life span only 2, so if I don't eat it now, it might disappear soon.\n\nLife span 2 at turn 51: after turn 51, it becomes 1, after turn 52, it disappears. So I must eat it on turn 51 or 52 to get it.\n\nTurn 51: I can move to it now.\n\nTurn 52: if I don't eat now, on turn 52 I could eat it if I move there, but after turn 52 it disappears, so last chance is turn 52.\n\nBut on turn 52, if I don't eat on 51, the food might still be there if I go then.\n\nBut let's plan.\n\nAlso, other food: (6,3) with life span 8, so longer, and (1,3) with life span 5.\n\n(6,3) is at x=6,y=3, which is near head.\n\nNow, if I go R to (6,2) on turn 51, I eat food, head at (6,2), direction now R (since moved right).\n\nThen on turn 52, from (6,2), possible moves: U, D, L, R? But current direction R, so cannot go L (left) immediately.\n\nAlso, walls: x=7 is wall, so R to (7,2) is invalid, x=7 wall.\n\nSo possible: U to (6,3), D to (6,1), L to (5,2).\n\n(5,2) is now body? After move, positions: as above, [(6,2), (5,2), (4,2), ... , (6,4), (6,5)? Earlier I had new positions after eating at (6,2): head (6,2), then (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)\n\n(6,4) is the last, tail.\n\nNow at (6,2), possible moves:\n\nU to (6,3): (6,3) has food! Food at (6,3) with life span 8.\n\nIs (6,3) occupied? In positions, after move on turn 51, (6,3) is not in the list; positions: (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4). (6,3) not there, and it has food, so moving to (6,3) would eat that food too.\n\nD to (6,1): (6,1) is empty, no food.\n\nL to (5,2): (5,2) is the second segment, body, so collision.\n\nR to (7,2) is wall, invalid.\n\nSo from (6,2), I can go U to (6,3) or D to (6,1).\n\nIf I go U to (6,3), I eat another food, grow again.\n\nThen head at (6,3), direction U.\n\nAfter that, I need to see where to go.\n\nBut let's not get ahead yet.\n\nFirst, on turn 51, I have to choose: R to (6,2) or D to (5,1).\n\nIf I go D to (5,1) on turn 51, then head at (5,1), direction D (since moved down).\n\nThen positions: [(5,1), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)] tail at (6,5).\n\nFood at (6,2) still there, life span now 1 (since turn 51 passed).\n\nOn turn 52, from (5,1), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nCurrent direction D, so cannot go U (opposite).\n\nPossible: D to (5,0), but y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nL to (4,1), or R to (6,1), or U? U is opposite, not allowed.\n\nDirection D, so cannot go U.\n\nMoves: L to (4,1), R to (6,1), D to (5,0) invalid.\n\nSo only L or R.\n\n(4,1) and (6,1) should be empty.\n\n(4,1): x=4,y=1, not wall, not in positions: positions now [(5,1), (5,2), etc.], no (4,1), so free.\n\nSimilarly (6,1) free.\n\nNo food at these points.\n\nIf I go R to (6,1), then head to (6,1), direction R.\n\nThen I can later go up to (6,2) if food still there, but on turn 52, food at (6,2) has life span 1, so if I move to it on turn 52, I can eat it before it disappears.\n\nBut from (6,1), to go to (6,2), that would be U, which might be allowed depending on direction.\n\nBut let's sequence.\n\nFirst, back to turn 51 choice.\n\nIf I go R to (6,2) on turn 51, I eat food, head at (6,2), and I can then go U to (6,3) on turn 52 to eat another food, getting two foods quickly.\n\nBut is that safe?\n\nAfter eating (6,2) and (6,3), snake grows to 14 segments? Let's see.\n\nAfter turn 51: ate (6,2), positions: 13 segments.\n\nThen on turn 52, go U to (6,3), eat (6,3), so new head (6,3), and positions: [ (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4) ] since after eating, tail doesn't move, so (6,4) remains.\n\nNow head at (6,3), direction U.\n\nNow from here, possible moves: U to (6,4), but (6,4) is the tail! (6,4) is in positions, it's the last segment.\n\nIf I go U to (6,4), that would be moving head to tail position, but since the tail will move, it might be ok, but need to check collision.\n\nGeneral rule: moving to the tail cell is safe because the tail moves away, unless it's a food cell with tail reward danger, but here (6,4) has no food, it's just tail.\n\nIn the positions, (6,4) is occupied by tail, but when I move head to (6,4), at that moment, the tail is still there, but after move, the tail moves to the next position, so it's not collision.\n\nOnly if I move to a body segment that is not tail.\n\nTail is special; moving to tail is safe because tail moves.\n\nIn this case, (6,4) is tail, so moving to (6,4) should be safe; head and tail swap positions effectively.\n\nAfter move, head at (6,4), tail was at (6,4) but moves to where? Let's see.\n\nBefore move: positions [ (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), ..., (6,4) ] with (6,4) as tail.\n\nMove head U to (6,4): now, since no food eaten (assuming no food at (6,4)? (6,4) is tail, no food mentioned, so no food.\n\nSo after move: head moves to (6,4), then each body segment moves: the segment at (6,3) moves to new head position? No.\n\nNew head position: (6,4)\n\nThen the first body segment moves to the old head position (6,3)\n\nThen next to (6,2), and so on.\n\nThe tail was at (6,4), but now head is moving to (6,4), so the segment that was at (6,4) is the tail, and after move, since no food, tail is removed.\n\nSo positions: new head (6,4)\n\nThen body: old head (6,3) moves to (6,3)? The segment that was at (6,3) moves to the position of the previous head, which is (6,3) itself? Messy.\n\nStandard: the new position list is [new_head] + old_positions[:-1] if no food eaten.\n\nBecause tail is removed.\n\nIn this case, old positions: list of positions, head at index 0, tail at index -1.\n\nAfter moving to new cell:\n\n- If no food, new head at new_cell, and new body is old [0] to old [-2], so tail removed.\n\n- If food, new head at new_cell, new body is old [0] to old [-1], so all old segments kept, tail not removed.\n\nHere, moving to (6,4), which is currently occupied by tail, but no food there, so no food eaten.\n\nTherefore, after move: new head at (6,4)\n\nThen new body: the old head (6,3) becomes first body, at (6,3)\n\nThen old body segments: old [1] to old [-2]? Old positions: index 0: (6,3) head, index 1: (6,2), index 2: (5,2), ..., up to index 12: (6,4) tail? Let's list indices.\n\nAfter turn 52 move to (6,3) and eat, positions: let's number.\n\nAfter turn 51: positions: [ (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4) ] so head (6,2), tail (6,4)\n\nAfter move on turn 52 to (6,3) and eat food: new head (6,3), then old positions: [ (6,2), (5,2), ..., (6,4) ] so 13 segments? Old had 13, new has 14: [ (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4) ]\n\nYes.\n\nNow on turn 53, from (6,3), direction U (since moved up).\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,4), D to (6,2), L to (5,3), R invalid (x=7 wall).\n\nNow (6,4) is part of body, it's the tail in current positions.\n\n(6,4) is occupied, but it's the tail.\n\nMoving to tail: as I thought, should be safe.\n\n(6,2) is also body, segment after head? Positions: head (6,3), then (6,2), which is body.\n\nSo moving to (6,2) would be moving to body segment, collision.\n\nL to (5,3): (5,3) is also body, position index? From above, (5,3) is in the list, e.g. after head (6,3), then (6,2), then (5,2), then (4,2), then (3,2), then (3,3), then (4,3), then (5,3), so (5,3) is the 7th segment, body, not tail.\n\nSo moving to (5,3) collision.\n\nD to (6,2) collision, as above.\n\nR invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is U to (6,4).\n\n(6,4) is the tail, so moving there should be safe.\n\nAfter move to (6,4): no food, so tail removed.\n\nNew head at (6,4)\n\nThen new body: old head (6,3) moves to (6,3) as first body? New positions: head at (6,4), then the old segments except tail is removed.\n\nOld positions: [ (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4) ] tail at (6,4)\n\nMove head to (6,4), no food, so new head at (6,4), and new body is old [0] to old [-2], so from index 0 to 12, but index 0 is (6,3), index 1 (6,2), ..., index 12 (6,4) but old [-1] is tail, not included.\n\nOld positions indices: 0: head (6,3), 1: (6,2), 2: (5,2), 3: (4,2), 4: (3,2), 5: (3,3), 6: (4,3), 7: (5,3), 8: (5,4), 9: (4,4), 10: (4,5), 11: (5,5), 12: (6,5), 13: tail (6,4) for 14 segments.\n\nAfter move to (6,4), no food, new head (6,4), and body from old [0] to old [12]: (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)\n\nSo new positions: [ (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5) ] with (6,5) as tail? 14 segments minus tail removed, so 13 segments.\n\nOld had 14, no food, so new has 13 segments: head at (6,4), then old head (6,3) at first body, then old body up to old [12] (6,5), and old tail (6,4) not included.\n\nSo positions: (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5) — 14 positions? Let's count: 1. (6,4) head, 2. (6,3), 3. (6,2), 4. (5,2), 5. (4,2), 6. (3,2), 7. (3,3), 8. (4,3), 9. (5,3), 10. (5,4), 11. (4,4), 12. (4,5), 13. (5,5), 14. (6,5) tail. But we removed one segment? No: old had 14 segments, we moved to a new cell with no food, so we add new head and remove tail, so still 14 segments? I think I confused.\n\nInitial snake length was 12, ate on turn 51 to 13, ate on turn 52 to 14, then on turn 53 move to (6,4) no food, so should be 13 segments after turn 53.\n\nOld positions before turn 53 move: 14 segments.\n\nAfter move to (6,4): head to (6,4), which was tail, but now new head.\n\nThe body segments: the segment that was at position i moves to position i-1 for i=1 to 13, but since we add new head, and remove the last segment.\n\nSo new head at (6,4)\n\nThen the segment that was at old [0] moves to where new head was? Better to think: the new body positions are the old head and body except the last one.\n\nSo new positions: [new_head] + old_positions[:-1]\n\nOld positions: [ (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), ..., (6,5), (6,4) ] with (6,4) tail.\n\nOld positions[:-1] is all except the last, so [ (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5) ]\n\nThen new positions: [ (6,4) ] + [ (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5) ] so 1 + 13 = 14 positions? But old had 14, we removed tail, so should be 13.\n\nOld positions have 14 elements: indices 0 to 13.\n\nOld_positions[:-1] is indices 0 to 12, that's 13 elements.\n\nThen new head, so [new_head] + old_positions[:-1] has 14 elements, but we should have 13 because tail removed.\n\nI think I have a mistake.\n\nStandard: number of segments.\n\nStart: 12 segments.\n\nTurn 51: eat food, grow to 13.\n\nTurn 52: eat food, grow to 14.\n\nTurn 53: move to (6,4) no food, so no growth, tail removed, so back to 13 segments.\n\nAfter move, positions: new head at (6,4), then the old head position becomes the new first body position, and so on, up to the second last old position, and the last (tail) is removed.\n\nSo new positions: head at (6,4), then the old positions from index 0 to 12 except the last is removed.\n\nOld positions before move: let's list with indices:\n\nIndex 0: (6,3) head\n\n1: (6,2)\n\n2: (5,2)\n\n3: (4,2)\n\n4: (3,2)\n\n5: (3,3)\n\n6: (4,3)\n\n7: (5,3)\n\n8: (5,4)\n\n9: (4,4)\n\n10: (4,5)\n\n11: (5,5)\n\n12: (6,5)\n\n13: (6,4) tail\n\nAfter moving head to (6,4), no food, so new head at (6,4), and new body segments are the old positions from index 0 to 12, but each shifted: the segment that was at index i moves to the position of index i-1 for i=1 to 13, but since we add new head, it's easier: the new position at index k is the old position at index k-1 for k=1 to 13, but with tail removed.\n\nNew head at new cell (6,4)\n\nThen for the body, the first body is at old head position (6,3)\n\nThe second body is at old position of index 1 (6,2)\n\nThird at old index 2 (5,2)\n\n...\n\nUp to the 13th body at old index 12 (6,5)\n\nOld index 13 (tail) is removed.\n\nSo new positions: head (6,4), body1 (6,3), body2 (6,2), body3 (5,2), body4 (4,2), body5 (3,2), body6 (3,3), body7 (4,3), body8 (5,3), body9 (5,4), body10 (4,4), body11 (4,5), body12 (5,5), body13 (6,5) — that's 14 positions, but we have 13 segments? Head and 12 body segments, 13 total.\n\nPositions: 1 head + 12 body = 13.\n\nList: (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5) — that's 14 cells, but it should be 13 segments. I think I counted wrong.\n\nAfter move, new positions are 13: from above, head at (6,4), then the next 12 are the old positions from index 0 to 11, but index 0 to 12 of old has 13 positions, but we take old [0] to old [11] for the body? I'm confusing myself.\n\nLet's take a smaller example.\n\nSuppose old positions: [A, B, C] with A head, C tail.\n\nMove head to D, no food. New head at D. Then body: A moves to where? New positions: [D, A, B] and C removed. So from 3 segments to 3, no change.\n\nIf had food, [D, A, B, C] 4 segments.\n\nIn this case, before turn 53 move, positions: 14 segments, let's say P0 to P13 with P0 head, P13 tail.\n\nMove head to Q, no food. New head at Q. Then new body: P0 at position 1, P1 at position 2, ..., P12 at position 13, and P13 removed.\n\nBut positions are cells, so new position list: [Q, P0, P1, P2, ..., P12]\n\nNumber of elements: 1 + 13 = 14, but P0 to P12 is 13 positions, plus Q, 14, but P13 removed, so from 14 to 13 segments.\n\nIn the list, [Q, P0, P1, ..., P12] has 14 elements, but P0 to P12 is 13 items, plus Q is 14, but it should be 13 segments. Error.\n\nP0 to P12 is 13 positions: index 0 to 12 inclusive is 13 elements.\n\nFor example, indices 0,1,2: 3 elements.\n\nSo P0 to P12 is 13 elements.\n\nNew positions: [Q] + [P0, P1, P2, ..., P12] = 1 + 13 = 14 elements, but we have only 13 segments because the tail P13 is removed.\n\nBut in the list, [P0, P1, ..., P12] are all the segments except P13, so it's correct, new head at Q, and the old head and body up to the second last are kept, with P13 removed.\n\nSo in this case, for turn 53, new positions: head at (6,4), then old head (6,3), then old body (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5) — that's 14 positions, but old had P0 to P13, 14, we remove P13, so new has Q and P0 to P12, 13 segments? P0 to P12 is 13 positions, plus Q is 14, but P0 to P12 includes the old head and body down to the one before tail.\n\nOld P0 to P12 are 13 segments (indices 0 to 12), and P13 is the 14th, removed.\n\nSo new positions: Q (new head) and P0 to P12 as body, so 13 segments.\n\nPositions: (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5) — that's 14 cells listed, but it should be 13 segments. I think I have an off-by-one error.\n\nAfter turn 52, positions have 14 segments: let's list them as S0 to S13:\n\nS0: (6,3) head\n\nS1: (6,2)\n\nS2: (5,2)\n\nS3: (4,2)\n\nS4: (3,2)\n\nS5: (3,3)\n\nS6: (4,3)\n\nS7: (5,3)\n\nS8: (5,4)\n\nS9: (4,4)\n\nS10: (4,5)\n\nS11: (5,5)\n\nS12: (6,5)\n\nS13: (6,4) tail\n\nOn turn 53, move head to (6,4), which is the position of S13.\n\nNo food, so new head at (6,4)\n\nThen the new body segments: S0 moves to the position of the new first body, which is the position that S0 was at, but since head moved, the body shifts.\n\nNew positions: new head at (6,4)\n\nThen the first body segment is at the old head position S0: (6,3)\n\nThe second body segment is at the old position of S1: (6,2)\n\nThird at S2: (5,2)\n\nFourth at S3: (4,2)\n\nFifth at S4: (3,2)\n\nSixth at S5: (3,3)\n\nSeventh at S6: (4,3)\n\nEighth at S7: (5,3)\n\nNinth at S8: (5,4)\n\nTenth at S9: (4,4)\n\nEleventh at S10: (4,5)\n\nTwelfth at S11: (5,5)\n\nThirteenth at S12: (6,5)\n\nS13 is removed.\n\nSo new positions: head (6,4), body1 (6,3), body2 (6,2), body3 (5,2), body4 (4,2), body5 (3,2), body6 (3,3), body7 (4,3), body8 (5,3), body9 (5,4), body10 (4,4), body11 (4,5), body12 (5,5), body13 (6,5)\n\nSo 14 positions listed, but it's head and 13 body segments? No, head and 13 body segments would be 14, but we should have 13 segments total.\n\nHead is one segment, body segments are 12 for a total of 13.\n\nIn the list, we have head and 13 body positions, which is 14, but body13 is the tail, so it's correct, 13 segments: head and 12 body, but here body1 to body13 is 13 body, plus head, 14, mistake.\n\n body13 is the last body, which is tail.\n\nIn the list, positions are: index 0: head (6,4), index 1: body1 (6,3), index 2: body2 (6,2), ..., index 13: body13 (6,5) — that's 14 indices, but for 13 segments, we should have indices 0 to 12 for 13 positions.\n\nI think I have an error in the numbering.\n\nAfter move, new head at (6,4)\n\nThen the new position for the first body segment is the old head position (6,3)\n\nThen the new position for the second body segment is the old position of the first body segment (6,2)\n\nThird body at old second body position (5,2)\n\nFourth at old third body (4,2)\n\nFifth at old fourth body (3,2)\n\nSixth at old fifth body (3,3)\n\nSeventh at old sixth body (4,3)\n\nEighth at old seventh body (5,3)\n\nNinth at old eighth body (5,4)\n\nTenth at old ninth body (4,4)\n\nEleventh at old tenth body (4,5)\n\nTwelfth at old eleventh body (5,5)\n\nThirteenth at old twelfth body (6,5)\n\nThe old thirteenth body (tail) was at (6,4), but we moved head there, and it's not included.\n\nOld positions had S0 to S13, 14 segments.\n\nS13 was at (6,4)\n\nNew positions: head at (6,4) which was S13 position.\n\nThen body1 at S0 position (6,3)\n\nBody2 at S1 position (6,2)\n\nBody3 at S2 position (5,2)\n\nBody4 at S3 position (4,2)\n\nBody5 at S4 position (3,2)\n\nBody6 at S5 position (3,3)\n\nBody7 at S6 position (4,3)\n\nBody8 at S7 position (5,3)\n\nBody9 at S8 position (5,4)\n\nBody10 at S9 position (4,4)\n\nBody11 at S10 position (4,5)\n\nBody12 at S11 position (5,5)\n\nBody13 at S12 position (6,5)\n\nS13 is gone.\n\nSo the new list has head and body1 to body13, which is 14 items, but body1 to body13 are 13 segments, plus head, 14, but it should be 13 segments. I think for 13 segments, we have head and 12 body segments.\n\nPerhaps body13 is not needed.\n\nAfter removing the tail, we have 13 segments: head and 12 body.\n\nSo the new positions should be head and the old S0 to S11 as body1 to body12, and S12 as body12, but S12 is (6,5), which was not tail.\n\nI'm making this too complicated.\n\nFor practical purposes, moving to the tail cell is safe, and after move, the tail is removed, so the cell is free.\n\nIn this case, from (6,3) moving to (6,4) is safe, and after move, head at (6,4), and the body is behind.\n\nThen from there, I can move to other places.\n\nBut in this path, if I go R on turn 51 to (6,2), then U on turn 52 to (6,3), then U on turn 53 to (6,4), but (6,4) was tail, so safe.\n\nThen on turn 53, head at (6,4), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,5), but (6,5) is body, in current positions after move, (6,5) is the last body segment, tail.\n\nIn new positions, (6,5) is the tail, so moving to (6,5) should be safe.\n\nD to (6,3) is body, collision.\n\nL to (5,4) might be body.\n\nR invalid.\n\nSo U to (6,5) possible.\n\nThen similarly.\n\nBut let's think about the other choice.\n\nIf on turn 51 I go D to (5,1), then I don't eat the food at (6,2), which has only life span 2, so on turn 52 it might be gone or I can eat it.\n\nBut let's consider the food at (6,3) with life span 8, so I have time.\n\nAlso, there is food at (1,3), which is far, at x=1,y=3.\n\nWith the snake coiled, it might be hard to reach without colliding.\n\nBut I need to plan long-term.\n\nPerhaps going for the close food is better.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nGrid is 8x8, walls at borders and obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: from (5,2) to (6,4), it's a bit tangled.\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nRows y=0 to 7, columns x=0 to 7.\n\nWalls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake: head (5,2), then (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4) tail.\n\nSo the snake is like: from (5,2) right to? Head at (5,2), last move R, so came from left, to (5,2).\n\nThen body: (4,2) left of head, (3,2) left, then (3,3) down, (4,3) right, (5,3) right, (5,4) up, (4,4) left, (4,5) up, (5,5) right, (6,5) right, (6,4) down.\n\nSo it's a bit messy.\n\nFood at (6,2), which is right of head, at (6,2).\n\n(6,3) is below that, but (6,3) has food.\n\n(1,3) is left top.\n\nNow, back to turn 51 choice.\n\nIf I go R to (6,2), I eat food, score +1, head at (6,2), then on turn 52 I can go U to (6,3) to eat another food, score another +1.\n\nThen on turn 53, I must go U to (6,4) because no other choice, safe since tail.\n\nThen on turn 54, from (6,4), I can go U to (6,5), but (6,5) is currently body, but after previous moves, let's see positions.\n\nAfter turn 53: head at (6,4), positions as above.\n\nFrom (6,4), direction U, possible moves: U to (6,5), D to (6,3), L to (5,4), R invalid.\n\n(6,5) is the tail in current positions? After turn 53 move, positions: head (6,4), then (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5) with (6,5) tail.\n\nSo (6,5) is tail, so moving U to (6,5) is safe.\n\nD to (6,3) is body, collision.\n\nL to (5,4): (5,4) is body, in positions, (5,4) is the 10th segment or something, body, not tail, so collision.\n\nSo only U to (6,5).\n\nGo to (6,5), no food, so tail removed, head at (6,5), direction U.\n\nThen on turn 55, from (6,5), U to (6,6) or D to (6,4) or L to (5,5), R invalid.\n\n(6,6): y=6, not wall, but internal obstacle at (4,6), not here.\n\n(6,6) empty? No food, and not occupied.\n\n(6,4) is body, collision.\n\nL to (5,5): (5,5) is body, collision.\n\nSo only U to (6,6).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut this path I am going up, and the snake is long, I might trap myself.\n\nIf on turn 51 I go D to (5,1), then head at (5,1), direction D.\n\nThen on turn 52, from (5,1), can go L to (4,1) or R to (6,1), since U opposite not allowed, D invalid.\n\nSay I go R to (6,1), head to (6,1), direction R.\n\nThen on turn 53, from (6,1), can go U to (6,2) or D to (6,0) invalid, L to (5,1) body, R invalid.\n\nSo U to (6,2), which has food if still there.\n\nOn turn 52, food at (6,2) has life span 1, so if I go on turn 52 to (6,2), I can eat it.\n\nFrom (5,1) on turn 52, I can go to (6,1), then on turn 53 to (6,2).\n\nBut on turn 52, from (5,1), I could go directly to (6,2)? From (5,1) to (6,2) is not adjacent; adjacent moves only U/D/L/R, so (5,1) to (6,2) is diagonal, not allowed. Only to (4,1), (5,2), (6,1), (5,0) invalid.\n\n(5,2) is body, so only (4,1) or (6,1).\n\nIf I go to (6,1) on turn 52, then on turn 53 to (6,2), but on turn 53, food at (6,2) is gone because life span 2 at turn 51, after turn 51 life span 1, after turn 52 life span 0, gone before turn 53.\n\nLife span decreases every turn including current.\n\nTurn 51: food at (6,2) life span 2.\n\nAfter turn 51, life span decreases to 1.\n\nAfter turn 52, life span decreases to 0, disappears, so not available on turn 53.\n\nTo eat (6,2), I must move to it on turn 51 or turn 52.\n\nOn turn 51, I can move directly from (5,2) to (6,2).\n\nOn turn 52, I can move to it from adjacent cells, like from (6,1), (6,3), (5,2), or (7,2) invalid.\n\nBut on turn 52, if I am at (6,1), I can go U to (6,2).\n\nSimilarly, if at (5,2), but (5,2) might be body.\n\nIn the alternative path, if on turn 51 I go D to (5,1), then on turn 52 I am at (5,1), and to go to (6,2), I need to be adjacent, but from (5,1), I can go to (6,1) or (5,2), but (5,2) is body, so only to (6,1), then on turn 53 it's too late.\n\nFrom (5,1) on turn 52, I can only go to (4,1) or (6,1), not directly to (6,2).\n\nThen from (6,1) on turn 52, I can go U to (6,2) on turn 52? Turn 52 action.\n\nOn turn 52, if I am at (6,1), I can move U to (6,2) if I choose.\n\nBut to be at (6,1) on turn 52, I need to move to it on turn 52.\n\nTurn 51: I am at (5,2), go D to (5,1), so on turn 52, I am at (5,1).\n\nThen on turn 52, from (5,1), I move to (6,1) or (4,1).\n\nIf I move to (6,1) on turn 52, then that's the action for turn 52, and I am at (6,1) at the end of turn 52.\n\nBut the food at (6,2) has life span 1 at turn 52 start, so if I move to (6,2) on turn 52, I can eat it before it disappears.\n\nOn turn 52, from (5,1), I can move to (6,1), but not directly to (6,2).\n\nTo move to (6,2) on turn 52, I need to be adjacent to it on turn 52 start.\n\nOn turn 52 start, after turn 51 move, head is at (5,1), and (6,2) is adjacent? (5,1) and (6,2) are not adjacent; they are diagonal. Adjacent means same x or same y, differ by 1.\n\n(5,1) and (6,2) differ in both x and y, so not adjacent. I can only move to (5,2), (5,0) invalid, (4,1), (6,1).\n\n(5,2) is occupied by body, so only (4,1) or (6,1).\n\nSo I cannot move directly to (6,2) from (5,1) on turn 52.\n\nThe only way to eat (6,2) is on turn 51 from (5,2) by moving right.\n\nIf I don't, it will disappear after turn 52.\n\nSimilarly, for the other food.\n\nSo to not miss the food at (6,2), I should eat it on turn 51.\n\nMoreover, it's positive, so good to eat.\n\nThen after that, I can eat (6,3) on turn 52.\n\nNow, after eating both, I am at (6,3) on turn 52, then on turn 53 I go to (6,4), safe.\n\nThen on turn 54 to (6,5), safe.\n\nThen on turn 55 to (6,6), etc.\n\nBut the grid has walls, and I might hit the wall or body.\n\nFor example, from (6,5), go U to (6,6), then to (6,7) but y=7 wall, so I have to turn left or right.\n\nBut there is the internal obstacle at (4,6), but at (6,6), I can go L to (5,6).\n\n(5,6) might be free, etc.\n\nBut I need to think about long-term survival.\n\nThere is food at (1,3) with life span 5, so I have until turn 56 to eat it, since turn 51 life span 5, after turn 51:4, 52:3, 53:2, 54:1, 55:0 gone, so last chance turn 55.\n\nBut with the snake coiled, it might be hard to reach (1,3) without dying.\n\nFor example, from current position, after eating (6,2) and (6,3), I am at (6,3) on turn 52, then to (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), then I can go left to (5,6), (4,6) but (4,6) is obstacle, so cannot, so to (3,6) or something.\n\nBut the body is below, so I might have space.\n\nBut let's see the area near (1,3): snake has body at (3,2), (3,3), (4,2), etc., so it's occupied.\n\nTo go to (1,3), I need to navigate.\n\nBut perhaps it's risky.\n\nThe food at (6,3) has life span 8, so I can eat it later.\n\nBut if I don't eat (6,2) on turn 51, I lose it.\n\nSo for maximizing score, I should eat it.\n\nMoreover, avoiding risks: if I go D to (5,1), I don't eat food, and I might be in a position where I have fewer options.\n\nFor example, from (5,1), I can go to (4,1) or (6,1), then from there, I can go to other places.\n\nBut (5,1) is near the bottom, and walls.\n\nBut I think eating the available food is better.\n\nAlso, the core rule: prioritize long-term survival, but here eating food doesn't immediately risk survival.\n\nIn the move to (6,2), it's safe.\n\nThen to (6,3), also safe.\n\nThen to (6,4), safe.\n\nThen I can start maneuvering.\n\nFor example, on turn 54 from (6,4) after going to (6,5), etc., but let's define the actions.\n\nTurn 51: go R to (6,2), eat food.\n\nThen turn 52: from (6,2), go U to (6,3), eat food.\n\nThen turn 53: from (6,3), go U to (6,4), no food, safe.\n\nNow on turn 54, from (6,4), as above, only U to (6,5) possible, since D and L are body.\n\nAfter turn 53 move to (6,4), positions: head (6,4), body (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), etc., so (6,5) is tail, so U to (6,5) safe.\n\nGo to (6,5), no food.\n\nThen turn 55: from (6,5), direction U, can go U to (6,6), D to (6,4), L to (5,5), R invalid.\n\n(6,4) is body, collision.\n\nL to (5,5): (5,5) is body, in positions, for example, after move to (6,5), positions: head at (6,5), then old head (6,4), then (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) with (5,5) tail? Let's not.\n\nFrom turn 54: after moving to (6,5), no food, so positions: head (6,5), then previous positions except tail removed.\n\nPrevious before turn 54: after turn 53, positions 13 segments, head (6,4), body (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) tail at (5,5)? Earlier.\n\nAfter turn 53: positions: head (6,4), body (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) with (5,5) tail. 13 segments.\n\nMove to (6,5) on turn 54, no food, new head (6,5), then body: old head (6,4), old body (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), and old tail (5,5) removed.\n\nSo new positions: head (6,5), body (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5) with (4,5) tail? 13 segments.\n\nBody: (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), tail (4,5)? List: positions: (6,5) head, (6,4) body1, (6,3) body2, (6,2) body3, (5,2) body4, (4,2) body5, (3,2) body6, (3,3) body7, (4,3) body8, (5,3) body9, (5,4) body10, (4,4) body11, (4,5) body12 and tail.\n\nSince 13 segments, head and 12 body, tail at (4,5).\n\nOn turn 55, from (6,5), direction U (since moved U to (6,5)? On turn 54 moved U to (6,5), so direction U.\n\nMoves: U to (6,6), D to (6,4), L to (5,5), R invalid.\n\n(6,4) is body1, occupied, collision.\n\nL to (5,5): (5,5) is not in positions; positions have (5,4) and (4,4), (4,5), no (5,5), so (5,5) is free? Positions: (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5)\n\n(5,5) not there, so free.\n\nAlso, no food at (5,5).\n\nSo I can go L to (5,5).\n\nD to (6,4) is body, collision.\n\nU to (6,6) is free.\n\nSo possible U or L.\n\nSimilarly, R invalid.\n\nSo I have choices.\n\nI can go L to (5,5) or U to (6,6).\n\nTo avoid going up to wall, I can go left.\n\nFor example, on turn 55 go L to (5,5), then from there to (4,5) but (4,5) is body, tail, so if I go to (4,5), it might be safe.\n\nBut (4,5) is tail, so moving to it is safe.\n\nThen I can navigate.\n\nBut I don't need to plan all details.\n\nThe point is, by eating the two foods, I get +2, and I can survive.\n\nIf I don't eat, I miss one food, and the snake is shorter, but I can eat other food later.\n\nBut since all food is positive, eating more is better.\n\nAlso, for long-term, having the food at (6,3) with life span 8, I can eat it later if I want.\n\nBut (6,2) is time-sensitive.\n\nSo I think for turn 51, I should go R to (6,2).\n\nThen turn 52 go U to (6,3).\n\nThen turn 53 go U to (6,4).\n\nThen for turn 54, from (6,4) after turn 53, I can go U to (6,5) as only choice.\n\nThen turn 55 from (6,5) I can go L to (5,5) or U to (6,6).\n\nTo avoid the top wall, I can go left to (5,5) on turn 55.\n\nThen from (5,5), I can go to other places.\n\nAlso, there is food at (1,3), but it might be hard to reach.\n\nBut with life span 5, from turn 51, I have until turn 55 to eat it.\n\nAfter turn 55, it disappears.\n\nBut from the current path, on turn 55 I am at (6,5) or (5,5), far from (1,3), and with the body, I may not reach in time.\n\nFor example, to go to (1,3) from (5,5), I need to go left, but there are body segments at (3,2), (3,3), etc., so (2,3) or (1,3) might be accessible, but it's tight.\n\n(1,3) is at x=1,y=3, and walls at x=0.\n\nFrom current, after eating, the snake is longer, but I can try to move left.\n\nBut it might not be worth the risk.\n\nSince I ate two foods, I have score +2, and I can survive to eat other food later, like (6,3) if not eaten, but I ate it on turn 52.\n\nIn this plan, I ate (6,3) on turn 52.\n\nFood at (6,3) is eaten.\n\nOnly (1,3) left, which I may not reach.\n\nBut it's ok, I have score.\n\nIf on turn 51 I go D to (5,1), then I miss (6,2), but I can eat (6,3) later or (1,3).\n\nFor example, from (5,1), go to (6,1) on turn 52, then to (6,2) but food gone, so to (6,3) on turn 53 or something.\n\nBut (6,3) has life span 8, so plenty of time.\n\nThen I can go to other areas.\n\nBut I have one less food.\n\nSo net, by going R on turn 51, I get at least one extra food.\n\nMoreover, with the D move, I might be near the bottom with fewer options.\n\nSo I think R is better.\n\nTherefore, for turn 51: R\n\nThen turn 52: U\n\nThen turn 53: U\n\nFor the answer, I need to provide actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nTurn 51 to 55 or 56.\n\nBut let's specify.\n\nAlso, after turn 53, I have choices.\n\nBut for the plan, I can set the actions.\n\nSince after turn 53, from (6,4), I must go U to (6,5) on turn 54, then on turn 55 from (6,5) I can go L to (5,5) for example.\n\nThen on turn 56, from (5,5), I can go D to (5,4) or U to (5,6), etc.\n\nBut I need to think about the direction.\n\nTo make it simple, I'll provide the actions.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 51: R (to (6,2))\n\nTurn 52: U (to (6,3))\n\nTurn 53: U (to (6,4))\n\nTurn 54: U (to (6,5))  // only choice\n\nTurn 55: L (to (5,5))  // for example, to go left\n\nThen for turn 56, I can decide later, but since the answer format might expect a sequence, I can add one more.\n\nBut the core is to think 5+ turns, so up to turn 56 or so.\n\nSince head direction matters, on turn 55, after moving U to (6,5) on turn 54, direction is U, so on turn 55, moving L to (5,5) is allowed, not opposite.\n\nThen from (5,5), direction L (left), so on turn 56, I can go L to (4,5), or D to (5,4), or U to (5,6), not R.\n\n(4,5) is body? After turn 55 move to (5,5), let's see positions.\n\nAfter turn 54: head at (6,5), positions as above.\n\nMove to (5,5) on turn 55, no food, so new head (5,5), then body: old head (6,5) moves to (6,5)? New positions: head (5,5), then old head (6,5), then old body (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5) with (4,5) tail removed? Old positions before turn 55: head (6,5), body (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5) tail.\n\nMove to (5,5), no food, new head (5,5), then body: old head (6,5) at body1, old body (6,4) at body2, (6,3) body3, (6,2) body4, (5,2) body5, (4,2) body6, (3,2) body7, (3,3) body8, (4,3) body9, (5,3) body10, (5,4) body11, (4,4) body12, and tail removed, so new positions: (5,5) head, (6,5) body1, (6,4) body2, (6,3) body3, (6,2) body4, (5,2) body5, (4,2) body6, (3,2) body7, (3,3) body8, (4,3) body9, (5,3) body10, (5,4) body11, (4,4) body12 and tail? 13 segments, so body12 is tail at (4,4).\n\nOn turn 56, from (5,5), direction L (since moved left), so possible moves: L to (4,5), D to (5,4), U to (5,6), not R.\n\n(4,5): not in positions, free.\n\n(5,4): body11, occupied, collision.\n\nU to (5,6): y=6, not wall, internal obstacle at (4,6), not here, so free.\n\nSo I can go L to (4,5) or U to (5,6).\n\nI can choose to go L to (4,5) for example.\n\nBut (4,5) is near the obstacle, but ok.\n\nSo for the sequence, I can provide up to turn 56.\n\nBut since the food at (1,3) expires soon, I may not reach it, so no need.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nTurn 51: R\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: L\n\nTurn 56: L or U, but in the answer, I can stop at turn 55 or add.\n\nThe instruction says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", so for turn 51, I need actions for turn 51,52,53,54,55 at least.\n\nSo 5 actions.\n\nI have turn 51 to 55.\n\nTurn 55 is L.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 54 U to (6,5), then turn 55 L to (5,5).\n\nThat should be fine.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, the AI must think at least 5 turns ahead. The current state (turn 51) has the snake head at (5, 2) facing right (\"R\"). The immediate food at (6, 2) has a low life span (2 turns) and must be eaten soon to avoid missing it, as it disappears after turn 52. Eating it provides +1 score and grows the snake. The food at (6, 3) has a longer life span (8 turns) and can be eaten later, but it is strategically beneficial to eat it soon after (6, 2) due to proximity. The food at (1, 3) is distant and may not be reachable before it expires (life span 5 turns, last chance on turn 55), so it is not prioritized.\n\nThe snake must avoid collisions with walls (borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7; internal obstacle at (4, 6)) and its own body. Movement must respect the no-instant-reverse rule. After evaluating all paths 5+ turns ahead, the optimal sequence eats the time-sensitive food at (6, 2) immediately, then eats (6, 3) on the next turn for maximum score gain. Subsequent moves focus on safe navigation to avoid trapping the snake, especially near the top wall (y=7) and the internal obstacle.\n\n### Action Sequence (Turns 51 to 55)\n- **Turn 51 (current turn)**: Move **R (right)** to (6, 2). This eats the positive food (+1 score), grows the snake to 13 segments, and avoids missing it due to low life span (it disappears after turn 52). The move is safe: no wall or body collision, and no tail reward danger (tail is at (6, 4), not adjacent).\n- **Turn 52**: Move **U (up)** to (6, 3). This eats the positive food at (6, 3) (+1 score), growing the snake to 14 segments. The move is safe: (6, 3) is unoccupied, and no risks are present. Direction change from R to U is allowed (not reverse).\n- **Turn 53**: Move **U (up)** to (6, 4). No food is eaten, but this move is safe as (6, 4) is the tail position; the tail moves away after the move, avoiding collision. Direction remains U (no reverse issue).\n- **Turn 54**: Move **U (up)** to (6, 5). No food is eaten. This is the only safe move: moving down to (6, 3) or left to (5, 4) causes body collisions, and moving right is invalid (wall). (6, 5) is unoccupied, and the move avoids immediate risks.\n- **Turn 55**: Move **L (left)** to (5, 5). No food is eaten. This move navigates away from the top wall (y=7) and toward open space, reducing long-term risk. Direction change from U to L is allowed. Moving up to (6, 6) or down to (6, 4) is possible but less optimal: (6, 6) risks future wall collisions, and (6, 4) is now body. Left to (5, 5) is safe and maintains flexibility.\n\n### Rationale for 5+ Turns Ahead\n- **Score Maximization**: Eating both (6, 2) and (6, 3) by turn 52 gains +2 score quickly. Missing (6, 2) means a permanent loss of points, as it expires soon. (1, 3) is not pursued due to distance and body obstacles; reaching it by turn 55 is unlikely without high collision risk.\n- **Risk Avoidance**: After turn 55, the snake is positioned at (5, 5) with options to move left, down, or up, avoiding dead-ends. The sequence prevents body collisions and leverages tail movements for safety. Moving up repeatedly from turn 53 to 54 is necessary due to limited choices but is low-risk because the tail is involved.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: By turn 55, the snake has cleared the critical food and can navigate toward the center or left side of the grid. The food at (6, 3) is eaten early, and no other immediate threats exist. Future turns (beyond 55) should prioritize open areas and monitor the remaining food at (1, 3) if feasible, but survival is ensured for now.\n- **Contingencies**: If the snake reaches (5, 5) on turn 55, it can move left to (4, 5), down to (5, 4), or up to (5, 6) on turn 56, all of which are likely safe based on current body positions. This maintains high mobility.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 51: R (right)\nTurn 52: U (up)\nTurn 53: U (up)\nTurn 54: U (up)\nTurn 55: L (left)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. The current turn is 52. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (4,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), and (4,6) is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (6,2), then body segments at (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4). That's 13 segments. Let me list them in order:\n\n1. Head: (6,2)\n\n2. (5,2)\n\n3. (4,2)\n\n4. (3,2)\n\n5. (3,3)\n\n6. (4,3)\n\n7. (5,3)\n\n8. (5,4)\n\n9. (4,4)\n\n10. (4,5)\n\n11. (5,5)\n\n12. (6,5)\n\n13. (6,4)  // Tail\n\nThe head direction is R, which means right, so it's moving towards increasing x.\n\nNow, food items:\n\n- (1,3) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (6,3) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (2,1) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food here.\n\nI need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks. Priority is long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's visualize the grid. I'll sketch an 8x8 grid.\n\nRows y from 0 to 7, columns x from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- (6,2) head\n\n- (5,2)\n\n- (4,2)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (4,3)\n\n- (5,3)\n\n- (5,4)\n\n- (4,4)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (5,5)\n\n- (6,5)\n\n- (6,4) tail\n\nFrom the positions, it seems like the snake is coiled. Let's trace the path:\n\nStart from head (6,2) right direction.\n\nThen (5,2) left? No, positions are listed from head to tail, so when moving, the head moves, and each segment follows the previous position.\n\nBut for collision, we care about the positions after movement.\n\nFood at:\n\n- (1,3)\n\n- (6,3)\n\n- (2,1)\n\nLife spans: (1,3) has life 4, meaning it disappears after 4 more turns, including current turn? The problem says \"life_span\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 52, life_span is given, so after turn 52, it decreases to 3, then 2, etc., until 0 when it disappears.\n\nFor (1,3): life_span=4 at turn 52, so it will disappear after turn 55? Let's see:\n\nAt turn 52: life_span=4\n\nAfter turn 52: life_span=3 (before turn 53)\n\nAfter turn 53: life_span=2\n\nAfter turn 54: life_span=1\n\nAfter turn 55: life_span=0, disappears before turn 56? The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nI think it's better to think: at the start of turn t, if a food has life_span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it exists during the turn when countdown is from L to L-1, down to 1 to 0.\n\nThe rule: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo for a food with life_span N at turn t, it exists for turns t, t+1, ..., t+(N-1), and disappears at the start of turn t+N? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" — so at turn t, when we are about to move, the life_span is given, say L. After the turn, it decreases to L-1 for the next turn.\n\nSo for (1,3) at turn 52, life_span=4. After turn 52 is executed, life_span becomes 3 for turn 53, and so on. It exists as long as life_span > 0, so it can be eaten on turns where life_span >=1.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, with life_span L, it can be eaten during turn t, and after turn t, if not eaten, life_span decreases to max(0, L-1).\n\nIf life_span was 1, after turn t it becomes 0 and disappears.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\n(1,3): life=4, so can be eaten on turns 52,53,54,55? Turn 52: if eaten, gone. If not, at start of turn 53, life=3, and so on. Up to turn 55: if not eaten by end of turn 55, at start of turn 56, life=0, gone.\n\nSince it disappears after N turns, for N=4 at turn 52, it will be gone after turn 55, so last chance to eat is turn 55.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) life=7, lasts until turn 58.\n\n(2,1) life=10, lasts until turn 61.\n\nNow, head is at (6,2), direction right. So possible moves from here: since direction is R, I can go U, D, R, but not L (reverse, which would be left, opposite to right, so not allowed).\n\nCurrent head direction is R, so from (6,2), moving right would be to (7,2), but x=7 is a wall, so not possible.\n\nMoving up: (6,3)\n\nMoving down: (6,1)\n\nMoving left: (5,2), but (5,2) is the neck, the first body segment. But in snake, moving to the neck is not immediately deadly because the tail moves away, but let's see.\n\nGeneral rule: head can move to a cell that is not a wall and not occupied by a body segment except the tail, because when head moves, tail also moves, so the tail cell becomes free, and the new head position is where it moves.\n\nCollision: head touches any body segment except that if it moves to the tail cell, it's ok because tail moves.\n\nIn this case, from (6,2), moving left to (5,2): (5,2) is the position of the first body segment. After movement, the head would be at (5,2), but the body segment that was at (5,2) moves to where? Let's think about the movement.\n\nAt turn start, snake positions: head (6,2), then body (5,2), (4,2), etc.\n\nIf head moves left to (5,2), then the new snake positions: head at (5,2), then the previous head (6,2) becomes the new neck, so the segment that was at (5,2) moves to (6,2)? No.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, all body segments shift forward, so the tail end is removed unless food is eaten.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- Head moves to new position.\n\n- Each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n\n- If no food eaten, the last segment (tail) is removed.\n\n- If food eaten, tail is not removed, so snake grows.\n\nIn terms of positions: new head position = move direction applied to old head.\n\nThen, for each subsequent segment, it takes the position of the previous segment in the old list.\n\nSo, if head moves to new_pos, then:\n\nNew segment 0: new_pos\n\nNew segment 1: old segment 0 position\n\nNew segment 2: old segment 1 position\n\n...\n\nNew segment k: old segment k-1 position\n\nThen, if no food eaten, the last old segment is discarded.\n\nIf food eaten, the last old segment is kept, so snake length increases.\n\nNow, for collision: after movement, if the new head position is a wall or a body segment (except that if it was the tail and no food eaten, it's ok).\n\nThe rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, moving to the tail cell is safe only if no food is eaten, because if food is eaten, tail doesn't move, so head and tail would be on same cell? No.\n\nCase 1: If head moves to a cell that was occupied by the tail, and no food is eaten, then tail moves away, so after movement, head is at new position, and tail is gone, so no collision.\n\nCase 2: If head moves to a cell that was occupied by the tail and food is eaten, then after movement, head is at that cell, but since food eaten, tail does not move, so the tail segment remains, and head is on the same cell as tail, which is collision? But the tail is part of the body.\n\nThe rule says: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn this case, for moving to a body cell.\n\nGenerally, if head moves to a cell occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, it's always collision, because that segment doesn't move away immediately.\n\nIf head moves to the tail cell:\n\n- If no food eaten, tail moves away, so safe.\n\n- If food eaten, tail stays, so head and tail on same cell, collision.\n\nBut in the tail reward danger, it specifies when head is adjacent to tail and eats food on tail cell.\n\nBack to current position.\n\nFrom (6,2), possible moves:\n\n- Up: to (6,3)\n\n- Down: to (6,1)\n\n- Right: to (7,2), but x=7 wall, invalid.\n\n- Left: to (5,2), which is currently occupied by the first body segment.\n\n(5,2) is segment 1, not the tail. Tail is at (6,4).\n\nSo moving left to (5,2) would be moving into a body segment that is not tail, so collision, death.\n\nTherefore, cannot move left.\n\nNow, moving up to (6,3): what is at (6,3)? Food is at (6,3), according to the list. Food positions: (6,3) is one of them, value 1, life 7.\n\n(6,3) is also a possible position, but is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: let's list all current snake positions.\n\nSnake: (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)\n\nSo positions: (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)\n\nNow, (6,3) is not in this list, so it's empty? But food is there, so it's a food cell.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) and (2,1) are food.\n\nAlso, internal obstacle at (4,6), which is not occupied by snake.\n\nNow, moving up to (6,3): this cell has food, so if I move there, I eat it, and snake grows.\n\nBut is it safe? After moving to (6,3), new head at (6,3), then body segments: old head (6,2) becomes new segment 1, then (5,2) becomes new segment 2, and so on, up to old segment 12 (6,4) becomes new segment 13, and since food eaten, no tail removed, so new tail is (6,4), but (6,4) was segment 12, now segment 13.\n\nNew positions: head (6,3), then (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)\n\nNow, is there collision? Head at (6,3), and body segments include (6,2), (5,2), etc. (6,3) is head, and no other segment at (6,3) since it was food, now occupied by head. The cells around: (6,2) is body, but not head position. So no immediate collision.\n\nBut we need to check future moves.\n\nMoving down to (6,1): (6,1) is within bounds, y=1, not wall, and not occupied by snake, no food there, so safe move, no growth.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n\nAlso, there is food at (6,3) which is adjacent, life 7, so plenty of time.\n\nBut (1,3) has short life, only 4 turns including current, so it might disappear soon if not eaten.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) has long life.\n\nNow, let's see the grid layout to plan a path.\n\nI'll make a simple grid representation.\n\nGrid 8x8, x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So the playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No, borders are walls, so cells like (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7) are walls. Internal cells (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle: (4,6), which is within, y=6, so row 6, column 4.\n\ny=0 bottom? Usually in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? The movement: U is (x,y+1), so y increases up, I assume, like standard coordinates.\n\nIn the food, (1,3), (6,3), (2,1), so y=1 is lower, y=7 top.\n\nSo let's set y=0 bottom, y=7 top, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nBut walls at y=0 and y=7, so rows y=1 to y=6 are playable? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so cells with y=0 or y=7 are walls. Similarly for x.\n\nSo the grid has cells from (1,1) to (6,6) as the main area, but (4,6) is obstacle, so not accessible.\n\n(4,6) is at x=4, y=6, which is on the top row since y=6 is one below y=7 wall.\n\ny=6 is not wall, y=7 is wall. So cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except where obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), so that cell is blocked.\n\nNow snake positions:\n\nList all occupied cells:\n\n(3,2), (3,3), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,2), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nAnd head (6,2), tail (6,4)\n\nFrom the list: (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)\n\nSo occupied: (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)\n\nNow, food at (1,3), (6,3), (2,1)\n\n(6,3) is not occupied, so it's free.\n\n(2,1) not occupied, (1,3) not occupied.\n\nNow, current turn 52, head at (6,2), direction R.\n\nPossible actions for turn 52:\n\n- U: to (6,3) — has food, eat, grow\n\n- D: to (6,1) — empty, safe\n\n- R: to (7,2) — wall, invalid\n\n- L: to (5,2) — occupied by body, not tail, so collision, invalid\n\nSo only U or D are possible.\n\nIf I go U to (6,3), I eat the food, snake grows to length 14.\n\nNew positions: head (6,3), then (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4) — tail at (6,4)\n\nSince I ate food, tail not removed, so positions as above, 14 segments.\n\nAfter this move, the head is at (6,3), and the body includes (6,2) below it, (5,2) left, etc.\n\nNow, from here, direction was R, but I moved U, so new direction is U.\n\nNow possible moves from (6,3):\n\n- U: to (6,4) — but (6,4) is currently the tail, but after move, what happens?\n\nCurrent positions before move: head (6,3), body (6,2), (5,2), etc., tail (6,4)\n\nIf I move U to (6,4), which is tail position.\n\nIf I eat food or not: (6,4) has no food, I think. Food is at (6,3) which I just ate, so (6,4) is empty or has food? Food positions are only (1,3), (6,3), (2,1), so (6,4) no food.\n\nSo moving to (6,4): since no food, tail will move away.\n\nAfter move: head to (6,4), then body: new segment 1: old head (6,3), new segment 2: old segment 1 (6,2), and so on, down to old segment 12 (which was (6,4)? Old positions: segment 0: (6,3), segment 1: (6,2), segment 2: (5,2), ..., segment 12: (6,4)? Let's index.\n\nAfter eating at turn 52, positions: 0:(6,3), 1:(6,2), 2:(5,2), 3:(4,2), 4:(3,2), 5:(3,3), 6:(4,3), 7:(5,3), 8:(5,4), 9:(4,4), 10:(4,5), 11:(5,5), 12:(6,5), 13:(6,4)\n\nTail is segment 13 at (6,4)\n\nIf I move U to (6,4) from (6,3), new head at (6,4). Since no food, tail is removed, so new positions:\n\nHead: (6,4)\n\nThen segment 1: old head (6,3)\n\nSegment 2: old segment 1 (6,2)\n\nSegment 3: old segment 2 (5,2)\n\n...\n\nUp to segment 13: old segment 12 (6,5)\n\nOld segment 13 (6,4) is not included since no food eaten.\n\nNew tail is old segment 12 (6,5)\n\nNow, head at (6,4), which was old tail, but since tail moved, no collision.\n\nBut (6,4) is now head, and it was empty before.\n\nFrom (6,3), moving U to (6,4) is possible and safe.\n\nOther moves from (6,3):\n\n- D: to (6,2) — but (6,2) is occupied by segment 1, which is body, not tail, so collision. Invalid.\n\n- L: to (5,3) — (5,3) is occupied by segment 7? Positions: segment 7 is (5,3), yes, body segment, not tail. Tail is (6,4). So (5,3) is body, moving to it would be collision. Invalid.\n\n- R: to (7,3) — x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo from (6,3), only possible move is U to (6,4).\n\nThen from there, head at (6,4), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,5), but (6,5) is currently occupied by segment 12, which is body, not tail (tail is (6,4)).\n\nAfter previous move, positions: head (6,4), body (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), etc., tail (6,5)\n\nIf move U to (6,5): (6,5) is tail position.\n\nNo food there, so if move to (6,5), head to (6,5), then since no food, tail moves away, so new head (6,5), new segment 1: (6,4), segment 2: (6,3), etc., and old tail (6,5) not included, so no collision.\n\nOther moves: D to (6,3) — occupied by segment 1 (6,3), which is body, collision.\n\nL to (5,4) — (5,4) is occupied by segment 8? Positions: segment 8 is (5,4), body, collision.\n\nR: to (7,4) wall, invalid.\n\nSo only U possible to (6,5).\n\nThen similarly, from (6,5), only can go to (6,6) or other, but (6,6) is y=6, not wall, but internal obstacle? (4,6) is obstacle, but (6,6) is different cell.\n\n(6,6) is empty, I think.\n\nBut from (6,5), move U to (6,6): then head to (6,6), which is ok.\n\nBut then I might be stuck at the top.\n\nThis is if I go up initially.\n\nBut let's not get ahead; I need to think about the food.\n\nBack to turn 52 choices.\n\nIf I go up to (6,3), I eat the food, but then I'm forced to go up to (6,4), then (6,5), then (6,6). From (6,6), I can go left or right or down, but down is (6,5) which might be body.\n\nAfter moving to (6,6) from (6,5), let's see the positions.\n\nAssume turn 52: move U to (6,3), eat food.\n\nTurn 53: from (6,3), only possible move U to (6,4), no food.\n\nNew positions: head (6,4), body (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5) — tail at (6,5), length 14? After no food, tail removed? After turn 53 move, no food eaten, so snake length decreases? No.\n\nAfter turn 52: ate food, so length 14.\n\nAfter turn 53: moved to (6,4), no food eaten, so tail removed, so new positions: head (6,4), then (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) — and (6,5) was tail, removed, so segment 12 is (5,5), tail at (5,5). Length 13.\n\nPositions: after turn 53 move:\n\n- Head moved to (6,4)\n\n- Body: segment 1: old head (6,3)\n\nSegment 2: old segment 1 (6,2)\n\nSegment 3: old segment 2 (5,2)\n\nSegment 4: old segment 3 (4,2)\n\nSegment 5: old segment 4 (3,2)\n\nSegment 6: old segment 5 (3,3)\n\nSegment 7: old segment 6 (4,3)\n\nSegment 8: old segment 7 (5,3)\n\nSegment 9: old segment 8 (5,4)\n\nSegment 10: old segment 9 (4,4)\n\nSegment 11: old segment 10 (4,5)\n\nSegment 12: old segment 11 (5,5)\n\nOld segment 12 (6,5) not included, and old segment 13 was (6,4) but head moved there, so not body.\n\nSo tail is at (5,5)\n\nHead at (6,4)\n\nNow turn 54, from (6,4), direction U (since last move up).\n\nPossible moves:\n\nU to (6,5): (6,5) is not occupied now? Current positions: (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)\n\nSo (6,5) is free.\n\nAlso, (5,4) is occupied, (6,3) occupied, etc.\n\nU to (6,5): free, no food.\n\nD to (6,3): occupied by segment 1 (6,3), body, collision.\n\nL to (5,4): (5,4) is occupied by segment 9, body, collision.\n\nR to (7,4) wall, invalid.\n\nSo only U to (6,5) possible.\n\nMove to (6,5), no food.\n\nNew positions: head (6,5), body (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5) — tail at (4,5)? After move: head to (6,5), segment 1: (6,4), segment 2: (6,3), segment 3: (6,2), segment 4: (5,2), segment 5: (4,2), segment 6: (3,2), segment 7: (3,3), segment 8: (4,3), segment 9: (5,3), segment 10: (5,4), segment 11: (4,4), segment 12: (4,5) — and (5,5) was old segment 12, not included since no food, so tail at (4,5).\n\nLength 12.\n\nNow head at (6,5), direction U.\n\nTurn 55: move U to (6,6), which is free, no wall, not obstacle. (4,6) is obstacle, but (6,6) is different.\n\nMove to (6,6), no food.\n\nThen from there, I can go L to (5,6) or D to (6,5), but (6,5) might be body.\n\nAfter move to (6,6), positions: head (6,6), body (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4) — tail at (4,4)? Let's not continue.\n\nThe point is, by going up to (6,3) on turn 52, I eat the food, but then I'm forced up to the top row, and the snake is long, so I might get trapped.\n\nMoreover, the food at (1,3) has short life, only 4 turns, so at turn 52, life=4, after turn 52, life=3, turn 53 life=2, turn 54 life=1, turn 55 life=0 gone. So last chance to eat is turn 55.\n\nBut if I go this way, I'm at (6,6) on turn 55, far from (1,3).\n\n(1,3) is at left bottom, I'm at top right.\n\nSo I won't reach it.\n\nNow, alternative: at turn 52, go down to (6,1).\n\nThen from (6,1), I can go left or down or right, but right to (7,1) wall, down to (6,0) wall, so only left to (5,1) or up to (6,2), but (6,2) is body.\n\nAfter moving to (6,1) on turn 52.\n\nTurn 52: move D to (6,1), no food, so tail removed.\n\nCurrent positions before move: head (6,2), body (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4) tail.\n\nMove head to (6,1), no food eaten, so tail removed.\n\nNew positions: head (6,1), segment 1: old head (6,2), segment 2: old segment 1 (5,2), segment 3: old segment 2 (4,2), segment 4: old segment 3 (3,2), segment 5: old segment 4 (3,3), segment 6: old segment 5 (4,3), segment 7: old segment 6 (5,3), segment 8: old segment 7 (5,4), segment 9: old segment 8 (4,4), segment 10: old segment 9 (4,5), segment 11: old segment 10 (5,5), segment 12: old segment 11 (6,5) — old segment 12 (6,4) removed.\n\nTail at (6,5)\n\nHead at (6,1), direction D (since moved down).\n\nNow possible moves from (6,1):\n\n- U to (6,2) — (6,2) is occupied by segment 1, body, collision. Invalid.\n\n- D to (6,0) — y=0 wall, invalid.\n\n- L to (5,1) — (5,1) is free, no food, so possible.\n\n- R to (7,1) wall, invalid.\n\nSo only L to (5,1).\n\nMove to (5,1), no food.\n\nNew head (5,1), body (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) — tail at (5,5)? After move: head to (5,1), segment 1: (6,1), segment 2: (6,2), segment 3: (5,2), segment 4: (4,2), segment 5: (3,2), segment 6: (3,3), segment 7: (4,3), segment 8: (5,3), segment 9: (5,4), segment 10: (4,4), segment 11: (4,5), segment 12: (5,5) — and (6,5) was old segment 12, removed, so tail at (5,5).\n\nDirection: moved left, so new direction L.\n\nNow from (5,1), possible moves:\n\nU to (5,2) — (5,2) is occupied by segment 3? Positions: segment 3 is (5,2), body, collision. Invalid.\n\nD to (5,0) — y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nL to (4,1) — (4,1) free, no food.\n\nR to (6,1) — (6,1) occupied by segment 1 (6,1), body, collision. Invalid.\n\nSo only L to (4,1).\n\nMove to (4,1), no food.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis way I'm going left and down, but (1,3) is at (1,3), which is up from here.\n\nI need to get to (1,3) before it disappears.\n\nAt turn 52, (1,3) life=4, so must be eaten by turn 55.\n\nDistance from head to (1,3): head at (6,2), target (1,3), so delta x=5, delta y=1, Manhattan distance 6, but with obstacles and body, it might take more turns.\n\nMinimum turns to reach: need at least 6 moves, but I have only 3 turns to eat it (turns 52,53,54,55; on turn 55 if I eat, ok).\n\nTurn 52,53,54,55: 4 opportunities, but I need to arrive on one of these turns.\n\nFrom (6,2) to (1,3): need to move left 5 times and up once, but not necessarily in that order.\n\nBut with the snake body, I need to find a path.\n\nFor example, from (6,2), if I go down to (6,1), then left to (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), but (2,1) has food, but that's different food.\n\n(2,1) has food, life 10, plenty of time.\n\nBut for (1,3), from (2,1) I can go up to (2,2), then (2,3) or (1,2), etc.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach (1,3) by turn 55.\n\nTurn 52: from (6,2), I can only go U or D.\n\nIf I go U to (6,3), I eat that food, but then I'm stuck going up, away from (1,3).\n\nIf I go D to (6,1), then I can start going left.\n\nTurn 52: go D to (6,1)\n\nTurn 53: go L to (5,1)\n\nTurn 54: go L to (4,1)\n\nTurn 55: from (4,1), I can go U to (4,2), but (4,2) is occupied by body? After turn 54 positions.\n\nTurn 52: move D to (6,1), no food, positions: head (6,1), body (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5) tail at (6,5)\n\nTurn 53: move L to (5,1), no food, positions: head (5,1), body (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) tail at (5,5)\n\nTurn 54: move L to (4,1), no food, positions: head (4,1), body (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5) tail at (4,5)\n\nNow turn 55: head at (4,1), direction L (last move left).\n\nPossible moves:\n\nU to (4,2) — (4,2) is occupied by segment 5? Positions: segment 5 is (6,2)? List: segment 0: (4,1) head, segment 1: (5,1), segment 2: (6,1), segment 3: (6,2), segment 4: (5,2), segment 5: (4,2), segment 6: (3,2), segment 7: (3,3), segment 8: (4,3), segment 9: (5,3), segment 10: (5,4), segment 11: (4,4), segment 12: (4,5) tail.\n\n(4,2) is segment 5, body, so moving U to (4,2) collision.\n\nD to (4,0) wall, invalid.\n\nL to (3,1) — (3,1) free, no food.\n\nR to (5,1) — (5,1) occupied by segment 1, body, collision. Invalid.\n\nSo only L to (3,1).\n\nMove to (3,1), no food.\n\nThen I'm at (3,1), and (1,3) is at (1,3), which is up and left, but I can go to (2,1) which has food, but life long.\n\nBut (1,3) disappears after turn 55, so on turn 55 I'm at (4,1) and move to (3,1), not at (1,3).\n\nFrom (3,1) on turn 56, I can go U to (3,2), but (3,2) is occupied? After turn 55 move to (3,1), positions: head (3,1), body (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4) tail at (4,4)\n\n(3,2) is segment 7, body, so moving U to (3,2) collision.\n\nFrom (3,1), I can go L to (2,1) or D to (3,0) wall, or R to (4,1) occupied.\n\nL to (2,1): (2,1) has food, so I can eat it on turn 56.\n\nBut (1,3) is gone.\n\nSo by going down at turn 52, I can eat (2,1) on turn 56, but not (1,3).\n\nTo eat (1,3), I need a different path.\n\nPerhaps from (6,2), I can only go U or D, and going U gets me the nearby food but moves away, going D lets me go left but not reach (1,3) in time.\n\nBut is there a way to go towards left earlier?\n\nThe only way is to go down and left, but as above, by turn 55 I'm at (4,1) or (3,1), not close to (1,3).\n\nDistance: from (6,2) to (1,3) is 5 left and 1 up, so 6 moves, but I have only 3 moves to make by turn 55 (turns 52,53,54 to move, arrive on turn 55).\n\nTurn 52: move 1\n\nTurn 53: move 2\n\nTurn 54: move 3\n\nArrive on turn 54 or 55.\n\nBut with snake body, I can't go directly because the path might be blocked.\n\nFor example, from (6,2), if I could go left, but I can't because (5,2) is body.\n\nThe only free cells are up and down.\n\nPerhaps I can go up but not eat the food, but if I go to (6,3), there is food, so I have to eat it if I move there.\n\nThe rule: if I move to a cell with food, I eat it automatically.\n\nSo if I move to (6,3), I eat the food.\n\nIf I don't want to eat it, I should not move there.\n\nBut in this case, for survival, it might be better to avoid eating now to have more space.\n\nBut the food at (6,3) has life 7, so I can eat it later.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) has short life, so I should prioritize eating it if possible.\n\nBut from current position, it seems impossible to reach (1,3) by turn 55 with the snake configuration.\n\nLet's confirm the life span.\n\nAt turn 52, (1,3) life=4.\n\nAfter turn 52, if not eaten, life=3 at start of turn 53.\n\nAfter turn 53, life=2 at turn 54.\n\nAfter turn 54, life=1 at turn 55.\n\nAfter turn 55, life=0, gone before turn 56.\n\nSo it can be eaten on turns 52,53,54,55.\n\nBut to eat on turn 52, I need to be at (1,3) on turn 52, but head is at (6,2), not possible.\n\nSimilarly, on turn 53, need to arrive on turn 53, but from turn 52, I can only move to (6,3) or (6,1), both far.\n\nOn turn 54, similarly far.\n\nOn turn 55, still far.\n\nSo it is impossible to eat (1,3) because of the distance and the snake body blocking the way.\n\nTherefore, I should give up on (1,3) and focus on other food and survival.\n\nThen, at turn 52, I have two choices: go U to (6,3) and eat food, or go D to (6,1) and not eat.\n\nIf I go U, I eat, but then I'm forced up, and the area at top might be tight with the obstacle at (4,6).\n\nIf I go D, I can explore the bottom left, where (2,1) food is, with long life.\n\nAlso, after moving down, the tail is at (6,5), which might free up space.\n\nLet's think about the map.\n\nThe snake is currently occupying a lot of cells in the right and center.\n\nBy moving down and left, I can free up the right side.\n\nFor long-term survival, I should avoid trapping myself.\n\nAlso, there is food at (6,3) which I can eat later.\n\nBut if I don't eat it now, it might disappear after life span, but life=7, so many turns.\n\nTurn 52 to 58.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) life=10 to turn 61.\n\nSo I have time.\n\nNow, the risk of going up: if I go to (6,3), eat, then I must go to (6,4), then (6,5), then (6,6).\n\nFrom (6,6), I can go left to (5,6), but (5,6) might be free.\n\nThen from (5,6), I can go down to (5,5) or left to (4,6), but (4,6) is obstacle, so cannot.\n\n(4,6) is obstacle, so from (5,6), I can go U to (5,7) but y=7 wall, or D to (5,5), or L to (4,6) obstacle, or R to (6,6) which is previous position.\n\nFrom (5,6), if I go D to (5,5), but (5,5) might be body at that time.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nAfter turn 52: move U to (6,3), eat, positions: head (6,3), body (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4) tail at (6,4)\n\nTurn 53: move U to (6,4), no food, positions: head (6,4), body (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) tail at (5,5)  (since (6,5) removed? After no food, tail removed.\n\nNew: head (6,4), seg1 (6,3), seg2 (6,2), seg3 (5,2), seg4 (4,2), seg5 (3,2), seg6 (3,3), seg7 (4,3), seg8 (5,3), seg9 (5,4), seg10 (4,4), seg11 (4,5), seg12 (5,5)  — old seg12 (6,5) removed, old seg13 (6,4) not, but head moved there.\n\nTail at (5,5)\n\nTurn 54: move U to (6,5), no food, positions: head (6,5), body (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4) tail at (4,4)  (old seg11 (4,5) removed? Let's: new seg1 (6,4), seg2 (6,3), seg3 (6,2), seg4 (5,2), seg5 (4,2), seg6 (3,2), seg7 (3,3), seg8 (4,3), seg9 (5,3), seg10 (5,4), seg11 (4,4) — old seg12 (5,5) removed, tail at (4,4)\n\nTurn 55: move U to (6,6), no food, positions: head (6,6), body (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4) tail at (5,4)  (old seg10 (5,4) now seg10, but tail is last.\n\nNew: seg0 (6,6), seg1 (6,5), seg2 (6,4), seg3 (6,3), seg4 (6,2), seg5 (5,2), seg6 (4,2), seg7 (3,2), seg8 (3,3), seg9 (4,3), seg10 (5,3), seg11 (5,4) tail at (5,4)\n\nNow head at (6,6), direction U.\n\nTurn 56: possible moves:\n\nU to (6,7) wall, invalid.\n\nD to (6,5) — (6,5) occupied by seg1 (6,5), body, collision.\n\nL to (5,6) — (5,6) free, no food.\n\nR to (7,6) wall, invalid.\n\nSo only L to (5,6).\n\nMove to (5,6), no food.\n\nPositions: head (5,6), body (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) tail at (5,3)  (old seg10 (5,3) now seg10, but tail is last: new seg1 (6,6), seg2 (6,5), seg3 (6,4), seg4 (6,3), seg5 (6,2), seg6 (5,2), seg7 (4,2), seg8 (3,2), seg9 (3,3), seg10 (4,3), seg11 (5,3) tail at (5,3)\n\nHead at (5,6), direction L (since moved left from (6,6)).\n\nTurn 57: possible moves:\n\nU to (5,7) wall, invalid.\n\nD to (5,5) — (5,5) is free? Current positions: (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) — so (5,5) not occupied, free.\n\nL to (4,6) — (4,6) is internal obstacle, wall, invalid.\n\nR to (6,6) — occupied by seg1 (6,6), body, collision. Invalid.\n\nSo only D to (5,5).\n\nMove to (5,5), no food? But (5,5) may have food, but in this case, food was at (5,5)? Food positions: (1,3), (6,3), (2,1) — (6,3) eaten, (1,3) gone, (2,1) still there. (5,5) no food, so no eat.\n\nPositions: head (5,5), body (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3) tail at (4,3)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThe snake is coiling, but I have space to move.\n\nBut I ate one food, and I can go to other areas.\n\nIf at turn 52 I go down to (6,1), then I can go left to (5,1), (4,1), etc., and eat the food at (2,1) later.\n\nFor example, on turn 56 as above.\n\nBut let's see which choice is better for long-term.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (6,3) is adjacent, and if I don't eat it now, I can eat it later, but the life span is decreasing.\n\nBut with life 7, I have time.\n\nAlso, by not eating now, I keep the snake shorter, which might be better for maneuvering.\n\nCurrently length 13, if I eat, length 14, longer snake harder to move.\n\nIf I don't eat, I can reduce length by not eating.\n\nBut to score, I need to eat.\n\nBut priority is survival, then score.\n\nBut maximizing score means eating when possible, but avoid risks.\n\nIn this case, going up to eat (6,3) might lead to a trap, but in the simulation, I was able to move to (5,6) and (5,5), so not immediately trapped.\n\nSimilarly, going down, I can explore.\n\nBut there is the food at (2,1) with long life, and I can eat it when I go there.\n\nNow, to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nLet's consider the grid and snake position.\n\nThe snake is mostly on the right and center, with a loop.\n\nBy moving down and left, I can access the bottom left area.\n\nFor example, from (6,2) down to (6,1), then left to (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), then to (2,1) eat food, or to (1,1), etc.\n\nThen from there, I can go up to (1,2), (1,3) but (1,3) will be gone.\n\n(1,3) gone by turn 56.\n\nSo after eating (2,1), I can go to other places.\n\nThe top area has the obstacle, so less space.\n\nThe bottom left has more open space.\n\nFor example, cells like (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,1), etc., might be free.\n\nCurrent occupied: let's list free cells.\n\nAll cells not wall, not obstacle, not snake.\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7 and (4,6)\n\nPlayable cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 except (4,6)\n\nSnake occupied: (3,2), (3,3), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,2), (6,4), (6,5) and head (6,2) but same.\n\nFrom list: (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)\n\nSo free cells: for example, (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,1), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,1), (5,1), (5,6), (6,1), (6,3), (6,6) but (6,3) food, (4,6) obstacle, so (3,6) etc.\n\n(6,3) is free with food.\n\n(6,6) free.\n\n(5,6) free.\n\n(4,1) free.\n\n Etc.\n\nBottom left has many free cells.\n\nTop right has fewer free cells near the snake.\n\nSo for long-term survival, moving down and left might be better to access open areas.\n\nThen I can eat the food at (2,1) later.\n\nAlso, the food at (6,3) I can eat later if I want, but with life 7, I can ignore it if not convenient.\n\nBut since it's positive, I should eat it when possible without risk.\n\nAt turn 52, if I go down to (6,1), I don't eat, snake shortens to 12.\n\nThen I can go left.\n\nOn later turns, I can come back to eat (6,3) if life allows.\n\nBut let's see the direction.\n\nAfter moving down to (6,1), direction D.\n\nThen I go L to (5,1), direction L.\n\nThen L to (4,1), direction L.\n\nThen from (4,1), I can go L to (3,1), then to (2,1), eat.\n\nFrom (2,1), I can go U to (2,2), etc.\n\nBut (2,1) has food, so when I move to it, I eat.\n\nLife span of (6,3) is 7, so from turn 52, it can be eaten until turn 58.\n\nAfter eating (2,1), I can go back to right.\n\nBut the snake is long, might block.\n\nPerhaps it's better to go for (6,3) now since it's easy, and then deal with the top.\n\nBut in the top, with the obstacle, it might be risky.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 52, go down to (6,1), then on turn 53, instead of left, I can go up to (6,2), but (6,2) is body, collision.\n\nFrom (6,1), after move, positions: head (6,1), body (6,2), (5,2), etc.\n\nMoving U to (6,2) is occupied, collision.\n\nSo only left to (5,1).\n\nNo choice.\n\nSimilarly, from (5,1), only left to (4,1).\n\nSo once I go down, I'm committed to left for a few turns.\n\nSimilarly, if I go up, committed to up for a few turns.\n\nSo for long-term, going down and left might be better because of the open space.\n\nAlso, I can eat the food at (2,1) soon.\n\nLet's plan 5 turns.\n\nTurn 52: move D to (6,1)  -- avoid eating (6,3) now to keep snake shorter and access left.\n\nThen turn 53: from (6,1), move L to (5,1)\n\nTurn 54: from (5,1), move L to (4,1)\n\nTurn 55: from (4,1), move L to (3,1)\n\nTurn 56: from (3,1), move L to (2,1) and eat food there.\n\nThen snake grows.\n\nBut on turn 55, (1,3) is gone, but we don't care.\n\nAfter that, from (2,1), I can go U to (2,2) or L to (1,1), etc.\n\nBut L to (1,1) might be wall? x=1 not wall, y=1 not wall, so (1,1) is playable.\n\nU to (2,2), etc.\n\nNow, the food at (6,3) is still there with life decreasing.\n\nAfter eating (2,1), snake longer, but I can move around.\n\nCompared to going up: if I go up at turn 52, I eat (6,3), then go to (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), and so on, and I might be able to go down or left, but the body is behind.\n\nIn both cases, I can survive.\n\nBut by going down first, I can eat the food at (2,1) which has the same value, and I have more space to move.\n\nAlso, the (6,3) food might be eaten later if I come back, but with life 7, by turn 58, I might not be back, so it might disappear.\n\nBut that's ok, I can eat other food.\n\nThere might be new food spawning, but the problem doesn't say, so I think only these foods are present.\n\nThe state has only these foods, so no new food.\n\nSo only three foods, one will disappear soon.\n\nTo maximize score, I should eat as many as possible.\n\n(1,3) is impossible, so I can eat at most two: (6,3) and (2,1).\n\nIf I eat (6,3) now, and later (2,1), or eat (2,1) first, then (6,3) if possible.\n\nIf I eat (6,3) now, snake longer, harder to move to (2,1).\n\nFor example, after going up and eating, on turn 56 I am at (5,6) or something, far from (2,1).\n\nDistance from (5,6) to (2,1) is large.\n\nWhereas if I go down and left, on turn 56 I am at (2,1) eating that food.\n\nThen from there, I can try to go to (6,3), but it might be gone or far.\n\n(6,3) life=7 at turn 52, so after turn 52, life=6, turn 53:5, turn 54:4, turn 55:3, turn 56:2, turn 57:1, turn 58:0 gone.\n\nSo on turn 56, life=2, so I can eat on turn 56 or 57 or 58.\n\nBut on turn 56, if I am at (2,1) after eating, head at (2,1), then to go to (6,3), Manhattan distance |6-2| + |3-1| = 4+2=6, so at least 6 turns, but on turn 56, I need to arrive by turn 58, so 3 turns: turn 56,57,58 to move.\n\nFrom (2,1) to (6,3) in 3 moves impossible, min 4 moves, e.g., right, right, up, up, but not direct.\n\nSo I cannot reach (6,3) in time if I eat (2,1) on turn 56.\n\nIf I don't eat (6,3) on turn 52, and I go for (2,1), I might miss (6,3).\n\nBut (6,3) is only +1, same as (2,1), so no big loss.\n\nAnd by not eating (6,3), I keep snake shorter for longer, which might allow better movement.\n\nCurrently length 13, if I eat (6,3), length 14, then when I move, it shortens if no eat, but when I eat later, it grows.\n\nIf I don't eat now, on turn 52 move to (6,1), no eat, length 12.\n\nThen turn 53 to (5,1), no eat, length 11? When no eat, length decreases.\n\nTurn 52: move to (6,1), no eat, so from 13 to 12.\n\nTurn 53: to (5,1), no eat, length 11.\n\nTurn 54: to (4,1), no eat, length 10.\n\nTurn 55: to (3,1), no eat, length 9.\n\nTurn 56: to (2,1), eat, length 10.\n\nThen I have shorter snake during the moves.\n\nIf I eat on turn 52, length 14, then decreases slowly.\n\nFor tight spaces, shorter snake is better.\n\nIn this case, with the internal obstacle, shorter snake might be easier to maneuever.\n\nBut in the bottom left, there is space.\n\nI think going down to (6,1) at turn 52 is better for long-term survival and to eat (2,1).\n\nThen I can explore the left side.\n\nAlso, the food at (6,3) will disappear, but I can't eat both, so it's fine.\n\nSo decision: turn 52 move D to (6,1)\n\nThen for the next turns, as above.\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nThe answer format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nt1=52.\n\nSo for turn 52: D\n\nThen turn 53: from (6,1), only L to (5,1)\n\nTurn 54: from (5,1), only L to (4,1)\n\nTurn 55: from (4,1), only L to (3,1) or other? Earlier I said only L to (3,1)\n\nFrom (4,1), after turn 54 positions.\n\nAfter turn 53: head (5,1), body (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) tail at (5,5)\n\nTurn 54: move L to (4,1), no food, positions: head (4,1), body (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5) tail at (4,5)  (old (5,5) removed)\n\nNow head at (4,1), direction L.\n\nTurn 55: possible moves:\n\nU to (4,2) -- (4,2) occupied by segment 5? Positions: seg0 (4,1), seg1 (5,1), seg2 (6,1), seg3 (6,2), seg4 (5,2), seg5 (4,2), seg6 (3,2), seg7 (3,3), seg8 (4,3), seg9 (5,3), seg10 (5,4), seg11 (4,4), seg12 (4,5) tail.\n\n(4,2) is seg5, body, collision if move there.\n\nD to (4,0) wall, invalid.\n\nL to (3,1) -- (3,1) free, no food.\n\nR to (5,1) -- occupied by seg1 (5,1), body, collision. Invalid.\n\nSo only L to (3,1).\n\nThen turn 56: from (3,1), move L to (2,1) and eat food.\n\nFrom (3,1), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,2) -- occupied, as before.\n\nD to (3,0) wall.\n\nL to (2,1) -- free, has food.\n\nR to (4,1) occupied.\n\nSo only L to (2,1), eat.\n\nThen for turn 57, from (2,1), after eating, head at (2,1), body includes (3,1), (4,1), etc.\n\nThen I can go U to (2,2) or L to (1,1), etc.\n\nBut I need to output only up to turn 56 or more?\n\nThe think ahead is for planning, but output should be for the turns starting from t1.\n\nThe answer should include actions for turn t1, t1+1, ..., for some number of turns, but at least the immediate action.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan 5 turns.\n\nBut output format is to list actions for consecutive turns.\n\nIn the boxed answer, it should be Turn 52: action, Turn 53: action, etc.\n\nI need to decide how many to list.\n\nSince the state might change, but no new food, so I can list multiple.\n\nBut after turn 56, it depends.\n\nFor now, for turns 52 to 56.\n\nTurn 52: D\n\nTurn 53: L\n\nTurn 54: L\n\nTurn 55: L\n\nTurn 56: L to (2,1) eat\n\nBut on turn 56, from (3,1) to (2,1), yes.\n\nIn terms of direction, when moving, the direction changes.\n\nBut for action, I just need to output the move.\n\nNow, to confirm, at turn 52, moving D to (6,1) is safe.\n\nThen the sequence.\n\nPerhaps I can include one more turn.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nAnother thing: the Tail Reward Danger, but not applicable here.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nIf I go up at turn 52, I eat (6,3), but then I might not get (2,1), and snake is longer.\n\nSo better to go for the left food with more space.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 52: D\n\nTurn 53: L\n\nTurn 54: L\n\nTurn 55: L\n\nTurn 56: L\n\nBut on turn 56, moving to (2,1) which has food, so eat.\n\nNow for turn 57, but I don't need to output, but for completeness.\n\nSince the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should list at least 5 actions, from turn 52 to 56 or 57.\n\nt1=52, so turns 52,53,54,55,56 is 5 turns.\n\n52 to 56 inclusive is 5 actions? Turn 52,53,54,55,56: that's 5 turns.\n\nYes.\n\nSo output:\n\nTurn 52: D\n\nTurn 53: L\n\nTurn 54: L\n\nTurn 55: L\n\nTurn 56: L\n\nIn the sequence, from turn 55, head at (4,1), move L to (3,1), then turn 56 from (3,1) move L to (2,1).\n\nYes.\n\nSo in the box.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State Overview:**\n- **Turn**: 52\n- **Grid**: 8x8 (cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, and internal obstacle at (4,6)).\n- **Snake**: Head at (6,2) moving right (direction R). Positions: [(6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (6,4)] (length 13).\n- **Food**:\n  - (1,3): value +1, life_span 4 (disappears after turn 55).\n  - (6,3): value +1, life_span 7 (disappears after turn 58).\n  - (2,1): value +1, life_span 10 (disappears after turn 61).\n\n**Immediate Constraints and Risks:**\n- From head position (6,2) with direction R:\n  - Right (R) to (7,2): wall (x=7), invalid.\n  - Left (L) to (5,2): occupied by body (not tail), collision, invalid.\n  - Up (U) to (6,3): contains positive food, but requires evaluation of future moves.\n  - Down (D) to (6,1): empty, safe.\n- Food at (1,3) has short life (only 3 turns left to eat: turns 52, 53, 54, 55). However, Manhattan distance to (1,3) is 5 (|6-1| + |2-3| = 5+1=6), and the path is partially blocked by the snake body. Reaching it by turn 55 is impossible with current constraints, so it will be abandoned.\n- Food at (6,3) is adjacent and can be eaten immediately (turn 52), but eating it forces the snake upward into a confined area near the top wall and obstacle (4,6), increasing collision risk with a longer snake (length 14). Life_span 7 allows eating later, but may not be feasible after moving away.\n- Food at (2,1) has long life (life_span 10), and moving down/left accesses open space in the bottom-left, enabling safer navigation and future eating opportunities.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy (5+ Turns Ahead):**\n- **Prioritize survival and access to open space**: Moving down (D) on turn 52 avoids eating (6,3) immediately, keeping the snake shorter (length decreases to 12 after turn 52) and allowing movement toward the bottom-left, which has more free cells (e.g., (1,1), (2,2), (3,1)). This reduces collision risk and provides maneuvering room.\n- **Target (2,1) for scoring**: After moving left for several turns, the snake can eat (2,1) by turn 56, scoring +1 with minimal risk. The bottom-left area is less cluttered than the top-right near (4,6).\n- **Abandon (6,3) if necessary**: Eating (6,3) now would trap the snake near the top, making it harder to reach (2,1) before it disappears. With life_span 7, (6,3) can be eaten until turn 58, but after moving left, the distance from (e.g., (2,1) to (6,3)) is at least 6 moves, which cannot be achieved in the remaining turns (life_span 2-3 after turn 56). Thus, (6,3) will likely expire uneaten, but this is acceptable as (2,1) provides equal score with lower risk.\n- **Turn-by-turn path safety**: \n  - Turn 52: Down (D) to (6,1) – avoids body, no food, safe.\n  - Turn 53: Left (L) to (5,1) – only safe move (no reverse, no collision).\n  - Turn 54: Left (L) to (4,1) – only safe move.\n  - Turn 55: Left (L) to (3,1) – only safe move.\n  - Turn 56: Left (L) to (2,1) – eat food, grow to length 10.\n- **Beyond turn 56**: From (2,1), moves like Up (U) to (2,2) or Left (L) to (1,1) are possible to explore open areas, ensuring long-term survival.\n\n**Conclusion**: Moving down immediately (turn 52) prioritizes long-term survival by accessing open space and enabling the snake to eat (2,1) safely. Eating (6,3) now would risk trapping the snake and losing access to (2,1). The sequence for turns 52-56 is safe, with no collisions or dead ends.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 52: D \\\\\nTurn 53: L \\\\\nTurn 54: L \\\\\nTurn 55: L \\\\\nTurn 56: L\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 53, and I'm the snake AI. The grid is 8x8 because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates go from (0,0) to (7,7). There's an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: The head is at (6,1), and it's moving down (direction D). The full snake body is: [(6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)]. That's 13 segments, so the snake is 13 units long.\n\nFood items:\n\n- At (1,3) with value 1 and life span 3. So, it disappears after 3 turns, including this one, so after turn 55? Let's clarify: life span decreases every turn, including current turn. So at turn 53, life span 3 means it will disappear after 3 more turns? No, let's read carefully.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo, for food at (1,3), life_span=3 at turn 53. That means after turn 53, it will have life_span 2 left, then after turn 54, life_span 1, and after turn 55, it disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 53, 54, or 55.\n\nSimilarly, food at (6,3) with value 1, life_span=6. So it will disappear after 6 turns from now, meaning it can be eaten until turn 58.\n\nFood at (2,1) with value 1, life_span=9, so it lasts longer.\n\nAll food has value 1, positive, so no negative food here.\n\nNow, the snake head is at (6,1), direction down. So possible moves from here: since direction is down, I can go down, left, or right, but not up because that would be instant reverse? No, instant reverse means I can't go opposite to current direction.\n\nCurrent direction is down, so opposite is up. So from (6,1), moving down would be to (6,0), but y=0 is a wall, so that's invalid. Moving left to (5,1), moving right to (7,1), but x=7 is wall, so right is invalid. Moving up to (6,2), but (6,2) is the second segment of the snake body, so that would be collision unless it's the tail and we're moving into it safely.\n\nLet's list the snake positions: indices 0 is head (6,1), 1 is (6,2), 2 is (5,2), 3 is (4,2), 4 is (3,2), 5 is (3,3), 6 is (4,3), 7 is (5,3), 8 is (5,4), 9 is (4,4), 10 is (4,5), 11 is (5,5), 12 is (6,5) which is the tail.\n\nSo from head at (6,1), possible moves:\n\n- Down: to (6,0) - but y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n\n- Up: to (6,2) - but (6,2) is occupied by the body segment at index 1. Since the snake is moving, after the move, the tail will move away, but the head moving to a body cell would collide unless it's the tail that is about to move.\n\nGeneral rule: when the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail is removed if no food is eaten. If the head moves to a cell that is occupied by any body segment except the tail, it collides. But if it moves to the tail cell, it's ok because the tail moves forward, so that cell becomes free.\n\nIn this case, (6,2) is not the tail; the tail is at (6,5). So moving to (6,2) would collide with body segment.\n\n- Left: to (5,1) - is this occupied? Let's see the snake positions: (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), etc. (5,1) is not in the list, so it should be free, assuming no wall or obstacle.\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, and internal (4,6). (5,1) is within bounds, not a wall, not occupied by snake except possibly if it's a body part, but from positions, (5,1) is not listed, so it should be empty.\n\n- Right: to (7,1) - but x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n\nSo possible moves from current position: only left to (5,1) is valid? Up to (6,2) is body collision, down to wall, right to wall. Only left to (5,1) seems possible.\n\nBut let's confirm the direction constraint. Current direction is down, so moving left or right is allowed, not up. Up is opposite, so disallowed. So only left is possible? But that can't be right; maybe I missed something.\n\nPerhaps moving to (5,1) is the only option. But let's list all adjacent cells:\n\n- North: (6,2) - occupied by body, not tail\n\n- South: (6,0) - wall\n\n- West: (5,1) - empty, I think\n\n- East: (7,1) - wall\n\nAnd (5,1) is not in snake positions, so yes, only (5,1) is free.\n\nBut is (5,1) a food or something? No, food is at (1,3), (6,3), (2,1). (2,1) is food, but (5,1) is not mentioned, so it's empty.\n\nSo from (6,1), with direction down, I can only move left to (5,1). That seems to be the only safe move.\n\nBut the problem is to think 5+ turns ahead, so I need to plan a sequence of moves.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSo accessible cells are (1,1) to (6,6) except (4,6).\n\nNow snake positions: head (6,1), then (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5). So the snake is coiled in the bottom right area.\n\nFood:\n\n- (1,3): value 1, life 3 (turns left: 53,54,55)\n\n- (6,3): value 1, life 6 (turns 53 to 58)\n\n- (2,1): value 1, life 9 (turns 53 to 61)\n\nNow, at turn 53, I must move from (6,1). As established, only possible move is left to (5,1), since up, down, right are blocked or deadly.\n\nAfter moving to (5,1), the snake head is at (5,1), and the tail was at (6,5), but since no food eaten, tail moves, so the new snake positions: head moves to (5,1), then the body: the previous head (6,1) becomes part of body, so new positions: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)] and the tail (6,5) is removed, so we have 13 segments still? No, moving without eating, length same, tail removed.\n\nOriginal positions: 13 segments. After move: head to new position, and all segments shift, so the last one (tail) is removed. So new snake: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)] — that's 13 segments, but (5,5) is the new tail? Original tail was (6,5), which is gone, and (5,5) was the second last, now last.\n\nPositions: index 0: (5,1) new head\n\n1: (6,1) old head\n\n2: (6,2)\n\n3: (5,2)\n\n4: (4,2)\n\n5: (3,2)\n\n6: (3,3)\n\n7: (4,3)\n\n8: (5,3)\n\n9: (5,4)\n\n10: (4,4)\n\n11: (4,5)\n\n12: (5,5) new tail\n\nYes, 13 segments.\n\nNow, head at (5,1), and direction: I moved left from down, so new direction is left? The head direction changes based on the move. Since I moved left, the new head direction is L.\n\nNow, from (5,1), possible moves: up, down, left, right? But with direction constraint. Current direction is now L (left), so I cannot move right (opposite) immediately.\n\nCurrent position (5,1), direction L.\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n- Up: (5,2) - but (5,2) is occupied by body segment at index 3 in the new list? New positions: head (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), so (5,2) is the fourth segment, not tail. So moving up to (5,2) would collide.\n\n- Down: (5,0) - y=0 wall, invalid.\n\n- Left: (4,1) - is this occupied? Snake positions: (4,1) not in list, so should be free.\n\n- Right: (6,1) - but (6,1) is occupied by the body segment at index 1, and it's not tail, so collision. Also, since current direction is left, moving right is opposite, so disallowed by instant reverse rule.\n\nSo only possible move is left to (4,1).\n\nSimilarly, I have to move left to (4,1).\n\nThen from there, head at (4,1), direction left.\n\nThen possible moves: up, down, left? But (4,1) up to (4,2), which is body segment (index 4 in new list? Let's not get ahead.\n\nI need to plan multiple turns.\n\nBut this seems like I'm being forced into a path. Let me sketch the grid.\n\nLet me draw a grid for y=7 down to 0, x=0 to 7.\n\nBut y increases up? Typically in coordinates, y=0 bottom, y=7 top, but in snake, sometimes y=0 top, but here walls y=0 and y=7, so let's assume y=0 bottom, y=7 top for simplicity, or not specified, but positions like (6,1) and (6,2), with head at (6,1) moving down to y=0, so probably y=0 is bottom, y=7 top? Head at (6,1) moving down, which is decreasing y, so to (6,0), but wall. So y=0 is bottom, y=7 top.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3) etc.\n\nSo let's define: bottom y=0, top y=7, left x=0, right x=7.\n\nSo grid:\n\ny=7 top row, y=6, ..., y=1, y=0 bottom.\n\nx=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacle (4,6), so (4,6) is wall.\n\nSnake at turn 53: head (6,1), then (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)\n\nSo let's list occupied cells:\n\n- (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)\n\nFood at: (1,3), (6,3), (2,1)\n\n(6,3) is food, but is it occupied? Snake has (6,2), (6,5), but not (6,3), so (6,3) is free and has food.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) and (2,1) are free.\n\nFrom (6,1), only move to (5,1) as established.\n\nThen turn 53: move L to (5,1)\n\nNow turn 54: head at (5,1), direction L (since moved left)\n\nFrom (5,1), only move to (4,1) as I thought earlier.\n\nMove L to (4,1)\n\nNow head at (4,1), direction L.\n\nFrom (4,1), adjacent cells:\n\n- Up: (4,2) - occupied by body, index 4 in new snake? After moving to (4,1), new positions: head (4,1), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5) and tail (5,5)? Let's list after turn 54 move.\n\nStart of turn 54: positions after turn 53 move: head (5,1), body (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)\n\nMove to (4,1): so new head (4,1), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5) and tail (5,5) is removed? No, when head moves to (4,1), the positions become: (4,1) new head, then previous head (5,1) is now first body, then (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), and (5,5) is the last, so it stays if no food, but since no food, tail (5,5) is removed, so new positions: [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5)] — 13 segments, tail at (4,5).\n\n(4,2) is occupied, at index 5.\n\nFrom (4,1), direction L.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Up: (4,2) - occupied by body, index 5, not tail, so collision.\n\n- Down: (4,0) - y=0 wall, invalid.\n\n- Left: (3,1) - is it free? Not in snake positions, not wall, so free.\n\n- Right: (5,1) - occupied by body index 1, not tail, collision. Also, opposite direction to current L, so disallowed.\n\nSo only move left to (3,1).\n\nTurn 54: move L to (4,1)? Turn 54 action is from (5,1) to (4,1), so for turn 54, move L.\n\nThen turn 55: head at (4,1), move to (3,1).\n\nHead to (3,1), new positions: head (3,1), then (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4) and tail (4,5) removed, so new tail is (4,4)? Positions: [(3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)] tail at (4,4).\n\nDirection: moved left, so direction L.\n\nFrom (3,1), possible moves:\n\n- Up: (3,2) - occupied by body index 7, not tail, collision.\n\n- Down: (3,0) - wall, invalid.\n\n- Left: (2,1) - food! (2,1) has food with value 1.\n\n- Right: (4,1) - occupied by body index 1, collision and opposite direction, disallowed.\n\nSo only move left to (2,1), which is food.\n\nSo at turn 55, I can move to (2,1) and eat the food there.\n\nValue +1, so snake grows, length increases to 14, and tail does not move.\n\nSo after eating, new head at (2,1), and the body: previous head (3,1) becomes body, and all segments stay, so positions: [(2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)] and since eaten, tail remains, so 14 segments, tail at (4,4).\n\nDirection: moved left, so direction L.\n\nNow, food at (2,1) is eaten, so removed.\n\nOther food: (1,3) life span was 3 at turn 53, so at turn 54, life 2, turn 55 life 1, so after turn 55, it disappears? Turn 55 action: when I move to (2,1) on turn 55, I eat it, so it's consumed.\n\nLife span countdown: at turn 53, food at (1,3) has life 3, meaning it can be eaten on turns 53,54,55, and disappears after turn 55.\n\nSimilarly, on turn 55, I eat (2,1), which has life 9, so plenty left.\n\n(6,3) still there.\n\nNow, after turn 55, head at (2,1), direction L.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Up: (2,2) - is it free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\n- Down: (2,0) - wall, invalid.\n\n- Left: (1,1) - free? Not occupied.\n\n- Right: (3,1) - occupied by body index 1, collision and opposite direction disallowed.\n\nSo possible moves: up to (2,2) or left to (1,1).\n\n(1,1) is close to food at (1,3), but let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, there's food at (1,3) which will disappear after this turn if not eaten, since turn 55 is the last chance to eat it.\n\nAt turn 55, after I move to (2,1), I ate (2,1), so (1,3) is still there, but after turn 55 action, it might disappear if not eaten.\n\nTurn 55: I move to (2,1) and eat it during this turn, so the food is consumed. (1,3) is not eaten, and after turn 55, its life span decreases to 0? Let's see the life span.\n\nAt turn 53: life span 3\n\nAfter turn 53: life span 2 (if not eaten)\n\nAfter turn 54: life span 1\n\nAfter turn 55: life span 0, disappears, so it can only be eaten on or before turn 55.\n\nOn turn 55, when I am at (2,1), I can move to (1,1) or (2,2).\n\nIf I move to (1,1), then from there, I can go up to (1,2) or left, but left x=0 wall, so only up to (1,2).\n\nThen to (1,3) to eat the food, but (1,3) is at y=3, so from (1,1) to (1,2) to (1,3).\n\nBut I need to see if I can reach it in time.\n\nTurn 55: head at (2,1), I can move left to (1,1) or up to (2,2).\n\nIf I move left to (1,1) on turn 55, then I am at (1,1), and (1,3) is two steps away: from (1,1) to (1,2), then (1,3). But on turn 55, I am at (1,1), and (1,3) can be eaten on turn 55? No, on turn 55, I am moving to (1,1), so I don't eat (1,3) yet.\n\nTo eat (1,3), I need to be at (1,3) on turn 55 or before, but turn 55 is the last chance.\n\nOn turn 55, when I move, if I move to (1,3), I eat it.\n\nBut from (2,1), I can't move directly to (1,3); only adjacent moves.\n\nFrom (2,1), possible moves: left to (1,1), up to (2,2), down invalid, right invalid.\n\n(1,3) is not adjacent to (2,1); it's two cells away.\n\nSo on turn 55, I cannot reach (1,3) from (2,1) in one move; I can only be at (1,1) or (2,2).\n\nTherefore, I cannot eat (1,3) on turn 55; it will disappear after this turn.\n\nSimilarly, on turn 54 or 53 I was not near it.\n\nSo (1,3) will disappear without being eaten.\n\nNow, back to planning.\n\nAt turn 55, after eating (2,1), head at (2,1), direction L.\n\nI can move to (1,1) or (2,2).\n\nIf I move to (1,1): new head (1,1), direction L (since left).\n\nThen from (1,1), possible moves: up to (1,2), down to (1,0) wall, left to (0,1) wall, right to (2,1) occupied by body, collision.\n\nSo only up to (1,2).\n\nThen from (1,2), move up to (1,3), but (1,3) food is gone after turn 55, so on turn 56, (1,3) is gone.\n\nTurn 56: from (1,2), move to (1,3) but no food, or to other directions.\n\nBut let's not go that way since no food.\n\nIf from (2,1) on turn 55, I move up to (2,2).\n\nThen head at (2,2), direction U (up, since moved up from left direction? Direction: previous direction L, I move up, so new direction U.\n\nFrom (2,2), possible moves: up to (2,3), down to (2,1) occupied, left to (1,2), right to (3,2) which might be occupied or not.\n\nCurrent positions after turn 55: head (2,1), body (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4) tail.\n\nFrom (2,2), if I move there, (2,2) is not occupied, so ok.\n\nThen new positions: head (2,2), then (2,1), (3,1), etc., tail (4,4) or since no eat, tail removed.\n\nBut let's focus on choices.\n\nAlso, there is food at (6,3) with life span 6, so it will be around for a while.\n\nBut I am far from it now.\n\nAnother thing: the snake is long, and the area is tight, so I need to avoid trapping myself.\n\nLet me list the free spaces.\n\nPerhaps I should aim for the food at (6,3).\n\nBut first, let's continue from turn 55.\n\nAt turn 55, from (2,1), I have two choices: move left to (1,1) or up to (2,2).\n\nIf I move to (1,1), I am forced to go up to (1,2) on next turn, then to (1,3) but food gone, then I might be stuck in the corner.\n\nFrom (1,3), I can go to (1,4) or (2,3), etc., but it's open.\n\nBut since (1,3) food is gone, no immediate reward.\n\nIf I move up to (2,2) from (2,1), then I can go to (2,3) or (1,2) or (3,2), but (3,2) is occupied? Let's see positions.\n\nAfter moving to (2,2) on turn 55: head to (2,2), no eat, so tail removed. New positions: head (2,2), body (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4) and tail (4,4) removed, so new tail is (5,4)? Positions: [(2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)] and (5,4) is last, so if no eat, (5,4) removed, so new snake: [(2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)] tail at (5,3).\n\nNow (3,2) is at index 9, occupied.\n\nFrom (2,2), direction U.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Up: (2,3) - free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\n- Down: (2,1) - occupied by body index 1, collision.\n\n- Left: (1,2) - free.\n\n- Right: (3,2) - occupied by body index 9, not tail, collision.\n\nSo can move up to (2,3) or left to (1,2).\n\nIf move left to (1,2), then from there to (1,3) but food gone, or to (1,1) but (1,1) might be occupied or not, but from (1,2) I can go up to (1,3) or down to (1,1), etc.\n\nBut no food there.\n\nMove up to (2,3).\n\nThen from (2,3), I can go to (2,4), (1,3), (3,3), but (3,3) is occupied by body.\n\n(3,3) is at index 10 in current snake? After moving to (2,3), positions: head (2,3), body (2,2), (2,1), etc., tail (5,3).\n\n(3,3) is occupied.\n\nBut let's think long-term.\n\nI should consider the food at (6,3). It has life span 6, so I have time, but the snake is in the left area, and (6,3) is on the right.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (4,6) might block paths.\n\nTo maximize score, I need to eat food while surviving.\n\nBut currently, from the start, I was forced to move left, and I ate (2,1) at turn 55.\n\nNow at turn 55, I need to decide the move.\n\nSince (1,3) is expiring, but I can't reach it, so forget it.\n\nFor the future, I can aim for (6,3).\n\nBut to reach (6,3), I need to go right and up.\n\nFrom (2,1) at turn 55, if I move up to (2,2), then to (2,3), then I can go to (2,4), etc., or to (1,3) but gone.\n\nFrom (2,3), I can go to (3,3), but (3,3) is occupied.\n\nLet's simulate the snake movement to free up space.\n\nThe tail is moving, so cells are freeing up.\n\nFor example, after eating (2,1) at turn 55, tail is at (4,4) but after moving, it changes.\n\nAt turn 55 after move to (2,1) with eat, tail at (4,4).\n\nThen if I move to (2,2) on turn 55, no eat, tail removed, new tail at (5,3) or something.\n\nLet's define turns.\n\nTurn 53: move L to (5,1) from (6,1)\n\nTurn 54: move L to (4,1) from (5,1)\n\nTurn 55: move L to (3,1), but at (3,1) I can move to (2,1) and eat food.\n\nAt turn 55: from (3,1) move to (2,1) and eat.\n\nSo positions after turn 55: head (2,1), body (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4) tail. Length 14.\n\nNow for turn 56: from (2,1), I can move to (1,1) or (2,2).\n\nIf I move to (1,1): then new head (1,1), no eat, so tail (4,4) removed, new positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)] tail at (5,3) or (5,4) is gone, so tail (5,3).\n\nThen from (1,1), only move up to (1,2) (as before).\n\nTurn 56: move to (1,2), no eat, tail removed, new head (1,2), body (1,1), (2,1), etc., tail (4,3) or something.\n\nThen turn 57: from (1,2) move to (1,3) but no food, or to (2,2) or (1,4), etc.\n\nBut not useful.\n\nIf from (2,1) at turn 56, I move up to (2,2).\n\nThen new head (2,2), no eat, tail (4,4) removed, new positions: [(2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)] tail at (5,3).\n\nDirection U.\n\nFrom (2,2), I can move up to (2,3) or left to (1,2).\n\n(2,3) is free, (1,2) is free.\n\nIf I move to (2,3), then new head (2,3), no eat, tail removed, new positions: [(2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3)] tail at (4,3).\n\nDirection U.\n\nFrom (2,3), possible moves: up to (2,4), down to (2,2) occupied, left to (1,3) food gone, right to (3,3) occupied by body (index 11, (3,3) is in body).\n\n(3,3) is at index 11, occupied.\n\nSo can move up to (2,4) or left to (1,3) but no food.\n\nMove to (2,4).\n\nThen continue up, but I need to go towards (6,3).\n\nThe snake body is blocking the way.\n\nFor example, to reach (6,3), I need to go through (3,3), but it's occupied, and will free up later.\n\nLet's see the path.\n\nI can go around the top.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 56 from (2,1), if I move to (2,2), then on turn 57 from (2,2), I can move left to (1,2), then to (1,3) gone, or to (1,1) but not useful.\n\nFrom (2,2) I can move up to (2,3), then from (2,3) to (2,4), then to (2,5), (2,6), but y=7 wall, so (2,6) then to (3,6), but internal obstacle at (4,6), so (4,6) blocked, so I can go to (3,6), (4,6) blocked, so to (5,6) or something.\n\nBut let's list free cells.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the food at (6,3) which is closer to the previous position.\n\nBut I moved away.\n\nAnother thought: at the beginning, from (6,1), I had to move left because no choice, but is there a way to go up? No, because (6,2) is body.\n\nBut (6,3) is food, so if I could reach it.\n\nFrom (6,1), I could only move to (5,1), but perhaps later I can go back.\n\nFor example, after moving to (5,1) at turn 53, then at turn 54 from (5,1), I moved to (4,1), but was there another choice? No, only (4,1).\n\nThen to (3,1), then to (2,1) with eat.\n\nSo no choice.\n\nNow from (2,1) at turn 56, I can choose to move to (1,1) or (2,2).\n\nMoving to (1,1) might lead to dead end, while moving to (2,2) allows me to go up.\n\nSo better to move up to (2,2) at turn 56.\n\nThen at turn 57 from (2,2), I can move up to (2,3) or left to (1,2).\n\nMoving to (2,3) is better to go up.\n\nSo turn 57: move U to (2,3).\n\nThen from (2,3), move U to (2,4) on turn 58.\n\nThen from (2,4), move U to (2,5) on turn 59.\n\nThen from (2,5), move U to (2,6) on turn 60.\n\ny=6, since y=7 wall, so (2,6) is top row.\n\nFrom (2,6), possible moves: down to (2,5) occupied, left to (1,6), right to (3,6), up invalid.\n\n(1,6) free, (3,6) free.\n\nAlso, food at (6,3) is below, life span 6, so at turn 53 life 6, turn 54 life 5, turn 55 life 4, turn 56 life 3, turn 57 life 2, turn 58 life 1, turn 59 life 0, so can be eaten until turn 58? Life span at turn 53: 6, so after turn 53: 5, turn 54:4, turn 55:3, turn 56:2, turn 57:1, turn 58:0, so disappears after turn 58, so can be eaten on turns 53 to 58.\n\nOn turn 58, life span 1, so if eaten on turn 58, it's ok, then after that it disappears.\n\nOn turn 59, it would be gone.\n\nBut I am at (2,4) on turn 58, far from (6,3).\n\nTurn 58: from (2,4) to (2,5), not near (6,3).\n\nSo I won't reach (6,3) in time; it will disappear.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 56, I am at (2,1) or (2,2), (6,3) is at (6,3), distance |6-2| + |3-2| = 4+1=5 moves away, but with the snake body, it might be blocked.\n\nFor example, from (2,2) at turn 56, to (6,3): one path could be (2,2) -> (3,2) but (3,2) occupied, -> (3,3) occupied, -> (4,3) occupied, etc.\n\nThe body is in the way.\n\nThe only way is to go around, like up to (2,6) then right to (6,6) then down to (6,3), but (6,3) is at y=3, so from (6,6) down to (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), but (6,5) is occupied by snake tail or body.\n\nAt turn 56, snake positions: if I am at (2,2), body includes (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), etc., and (6,5) was tail earlier but shifted.\n\nAfter turn 55, with head at (2,1), body has (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4) tail.\n\n(6,3) is free.\n\nBut to reach it, from (2,1), I need to go to (3,1), but (3,1) is body, occupied.\n\nThe cells will free up as the tail moves.\n\nFor example, at turn 56, if I move to (2,2), positions: head (2,2), body (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) tail.\n\n(3,2) occupied, (4,2) occupied, etc.\n\nOn turn 57, if I move to (2,3), positions: head (2,3), body (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3) tail.\n\n(3,3) occupied.\n\nTurn 58: move to (2,4), positions: head (2,4), body (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) tail.\n\n(4,2) still occupied.\n\nTurn 59: move to (2,5), positions: head (2,5), body (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) tail.\n\n(3,2) tail, so (4,2) still occupied.\n\nTurn 60: move to (2,6), positions: head (2,6), body (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2) tail.\n\n(5,2) occupied, etc.\n\nNow (6,3) is still there, but at turn 60, life span: started at 6 on turn 53, so on turn 60, it would be gone? Turn 53:6, 54:5, 55:4, 56:3, 57:2, 58:1, 59:0, so after turn 59, it disappears, so on turn 60 it's gone.\n\nAnd I am at (2,6), far away.\n\nSo I can't eat (6,3); it times out.\n\nSimilarly, the other food at (2,1) I ate, and (1,3) expired.\n\nSo for now, no food to eat in the near future.\n\nBut there might be new food spawning, but the state doesn't say, so I think only these food are present, and no new food mentioned, so I need to survive.\n\nAfter going to (2,6), I can move right to (3,6), then to (4,6) but (4,6) is obstacle, so can't go there.\n\n(4,6) is internal obstacle, wall.\n\nSo from (2,6), I can go to (1,6) or (3,6).\n\nSay to (3,6), then to (4,6) invalid, so to (5,6) or (3,5), etc.\n\nBut no food, so just moving around.\n\nBut I need to think for the answer.\n\nThe answer should be a sequence of moves for the next few turns, but how many? The format says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", and answer with actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but not specified how many.\n\nProbably for the immediate turns where I have choices.\n\nAt turn 53, I have only one choice: move L to (5,1)\n\nTurn 54: only move L to (4,1)\n\nTurn 55: only move L to (3,1) but at (3,1) I can move to (2,1) to eat, which is the only move, and I do it.\n\nThen at turn 56, from (2,1), I have a choice: move to (1,1) or (2,2).\n\nSince moving to (2,2) allows more flexibility, I should do that.\n\nThen turn 57: from (2,2), move to (2,3) or (1,2), I choose (2,3) to go up.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output a sequence.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns: turns 53 to 57 or something.\n\nBut at turn 53, only one action.\n\nSimilarly, up to turn 55, no choice.\n\nFirst choice at turn 56.\n\nBut the state is at turn 53, so I need to start from there.\n\nAlso, the food at (6,3) can be eaten if I can reach it, but I can't in time.\n\nAnother thing: at the beginning, from (6,1), is there a way to go up? But (6,2) is body, so no.\n\nUnless I move in a way that the body moves away.\n\nFor example, if I could move left to (5,1), then from (5,1), instead of left to (4,1), could I go up? But from (5,1), up to (5,2) is body, occupied, so I couldn't.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps later, but I think it's impossible to eat (6,3).\n\nSo for the sequence, at turn 53: move L\n\nTurn 54: move L\n\nTurn 55: move L (to (2,1) and eat)\n\nThen for turn 56, I need to choose.\n\nSince the goal is to maximize score, and no food nearby, I should avoid dead ends.\n\nMoving to (1,1) might lead to a corner, while (2,2) has more space.\n\nSo I should move up to (2,2) at turn 56.\n\nThen turn 57: from (2,2), move U to (2,3)\n\nTurn 58: from (2,3), move U to (2,4)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut for the answer format, I need to specify actions for several turns.\n\nPerhaps for turns 53 to 58 or something.\n\nSince \"think 5+ turns ahead\", from turn 53, turns 53 to 57 or 58.\n\nBut at turn 53, actions are determined until turn 55.\n\nLet's list the actions.\n\nTurn 53: move L (to (5,1))\n\nTurn 54: move L (to (4,1))\n\nTurn 55: move L (to (2,1) via (3,1), but directly to (2,1) from (3,1) with eat)\n\nIn terms of action, at turn 55, from (3,1) move L to (2,1)\n\nThen turn 56: from (2,1), move U to (2,2)  (I choose up)\n\nTurn 57: from (2,2), move U to (2,3)\n\nTurn 58: from (2,3), move U to (2,4)\n\nTurn 59: from (2,4), move U to (2,5)\n\netc.\n\nBut turn 58 might be too far, and I can stop earlier.\n\nSince after turn 55, I have choices, but for the sequence, I can provide up to where I have certainty.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns: 53 to 57.\n\nTurn 53: L\n\nTurn 54: L\n\nTurn 55: L\n\nTurn 56: U (to (2,2))\n\nTurn 57: U (to (2,3))\n\nThen for turn 58, it depends, but I don't need to specify.\n\nIn the answer format, it says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I can do for a few turns.\n\nAlso, to be precise.\n\nAnother thing: the Tail Reward Danger.\n\nBut in this case, no food on tail or adjacent in a dangerous way.\n\nFor example, at some point, if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, but here no.\n\nSo not an issue.\n\nSo I think the sequence is:\n\nTurn 53: L\n\nTurn 54: L\n\nTurn 55: L\n\nThen for turn 56, I need to decide, but since the state is given, and I need to output.\n\nPerhaps for the answer, I can output the necessary actions.\n\nSince at turn 56 I have a choice, I should specify based on strategy.\n\nI think moving up is better.\n\nSo for the boxed answer.\n</think>\n### Analysis of Current State and Plan\n\n**Current Turn:** 53  \n**Snake Head Position:** (6,1)  \n**Snake Direction:** Down (D)  \n**Snake Body:** The snake is 13 segments long, occupying cells: [(6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)]. The tail is at (6,5).  \n**Food Status:**  \n- (1,3): Value +1, life span 3 (disappears after turn 55).  \n- (6,3): Value +1, life span 6 (disappears after turn 58).  \n- (2,1): Value +1, life span 9 (disappears after turn 61).  \n**Walls and Obstacles:** Borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7; internal obstacle at (4,6).  \n**Grid Size:** 8x8, with accessible cells from (1,1) to (6,6) except (4,6).  \n\n**Immediate Constraints at Turn 53:**  \n- From head position (6,1) with direction D:  \n  - Down (to (6,0)): Wall collision (invalid).  \n  - Up (to (6,2)): Body collision (occupied by segment at index 1, not tail).  \n  - Right (to (7,1)): Wall collision (invalid).  \n  - Left (to (5,1)): Valid (empty cell).  \n- Only possible move at turn 53 is Left (L) to (5,1).  \n\n**Turn 54 Constraints:**  \n- After moving to (5,1), new head direction is L.  \n- From (5,1):  \n  - Up (to (5,2)): Body collision (occupied by segment).  \n  - Down (to (5,0)): Wall collision (invalid).  \n  - Right (to (6,1)): Body collision and opposite direction (invalid).  \n  - Left (to (4,1)): Valid (empty cell).  \n- Only possible move is Left (L) to (4,1).  \n\n**Turn 55 Constraints:**  \n- After moving to (4,1), new head direction is L.  \n- From (4,1):  \n  - Up (to (4,2)): Body collision (occupied by segment).  \n  - Down (to (4,0)): Wall collision (invalid).  \n  - Right (to (5,1)): Body collision and opposite direction (invalid).  \n  - Left (to (3,1)): Valid (empty cell).  \n- Move Left (L) to (3,1).  \n- From (3,1), the only valid move is Left (L) to (2,1), which has food:  \n  - Eating (2,1) gives +1 score, snake length increases to 14.  \n  - New head position: (2,1), direction L.  \n\n**Planning Turns 56-58 and Beyond (5+ Turns Ahead):**  \n- At turn 56, head at (2,1) with direction L. Possible moves:  \n  - Down (to (2,0)): Wall collision (invalid).  \n  - Right (to (3,1)): Body collision and opposite direction (invalid).  \n  - Left (to (1,1)): Valid, but leads to corner with limited space.  \n  - Up (to (2,2)): Valid, opens up more space for future movement.  \n- **Choice:** Move Up (U) to (2,2) to avoid dead-end and access the upper area for long-term survival. (1,3) food expires after turn 55, so no benefit to moving left. (6,3) is unreachable by turn 58 due to distance and body blocks.  \n- Turn 57: From (2,2), direction U. Move Up (U) to (2,3) to continue toward open space.  \n- Turn 58: From (2,3), direction U. Move Up (U) to (2,4) to maximize mobility.  \n\n**Long-Term Strategy (Beyond 5 Turns):**  \n- Survive by navigating to open areas (e.g., top-left or around obstacles) since no food is reachable soon.  \n- Monitor for new food spawns (not provided in state, so prioritize safety).  \n- Avoid the internal obstacle at (4,6) and walls.  \n- Tail Reward Danger: Not currently a risk, as no food is on the tail or adjacent with head proximity.  \n\n**Action Sequence for Turns 53-58:**  \n- Turn 53: Move L (only choice, to (5,1))  \n- Turn 54: Move L (only choice, to (4,1))  \n- Turn 55: Move L (to (3,1), then to (2,1) with eat)  \n- Turn 56: Move U (to (2,2) for better space)  \n- Turn 57: Move U (to (2,3))  \n- Turn 58: Move U (to (2,4))  \n\nThis sequence ensures survival for 5+ turns by avoiding immediate risks and positioning for future opportunities.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 53: L \\\\\nTurn 54: L \\\\\nTurn 55: L \\\\\nTurn 56: U \\\\\nTurn 57: U \\\\\nTurn 58: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 54, and I'm the snake. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (4,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are on the borders, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? No, the borders are walls, so cells like (0,y) and (7,y) for all y, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x are walls. Also, (4,6) is an internal obstacle.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (5,1), then body segments: (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5). Let me list them in order:\n\n- Head: (5,1)\n\n- Segment 1: (6,1)\n\n- Segment 2: (6,2)\n\n- Segment 3: (5,2)\n\n- Segment 4: (4,2)\n\n- Segment 5: (3,2)\n\n- Segment 6: (3,3)\n\n- Segment 7: (4,3)\n\n- Segment 8: (5,3)\n\n- Segment 9: (5,4)\n\n- Segment 10: (4,4)\n\n- Segment 11: (4,5)\n\n- Segment 12: (5,5)\n\nThat's 13 segments? Positions list has 13 coordinates, so snake length is 13. Head at (5,1), tail at (5,5).\n\nHead direction is L, which is left. So current movement is left, meaning from (5,1) it came from right, so previous move was right? Head direction is the direction it's facing, so since it's moving left, the head is at (5,1) and direction is L, so it moved to (5,1) from the right, I think. But for movement constraints, I need to know that I cannot reverse direction instantly. So since head direction is L, I cannot move R (right) on the next turn because that would be opposite.\n\nFood positions with value and life span:\n\n- Food at (1,3): value 1, life span 2\n\n- Food at (6,3): value 1, life span 5\n\n- Food at (2,1): value 1, life span 8\n\nAll have value 1, so all are positive food, no negative food here.\n\nLife span: for (1,3), it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 54, life span 2 means it will disappear after turn 55? Let's clarify.\n\nLife span N: disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn t, if life span is L, after turn t, it decreases to L-1, and so on, until it reaches 0, then it disappears.\n\nSo for food at (1,3): life span 2 at turn 54. After turn 54, it will have life span 1. After turn 55, it will have life span 0 and disappear. So it can be eaten on turn 54 or 55, but not after.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3): life span 5 at turn 54, so it will disappear after turn 58? Turn 54: L=5, after turn 54: L=4, ..., after turn 58: L=0, disappear. So available until turn 58.\n\nTurn t: food has life span L. After the turn, L decreases by 1. So on turn t, if L > 0, it can be eaten during that turn.\n\nAfter being eaten or after life span 0, it's gone.\n\nFor (1,3): L=2 at turn 54, so can be eaten on turn 54 or 55. After turn 55, if not eaten, gone.\n\n(6,3): L=5, available turns 54 to 58.\n\n(2,1): L=8, available turns 54 to 61.\n\nNow, I need to choose actions for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead. Prioritize long-term survival and maximize score.\n\nCurrent head position: (5,1), direction L (left).\n\nFrom (5,1), possible moves: U (up to (5,2)? y+1 is up? Let's confirm coordinates.\n\nTypically in grids, (x,y) with y increasing upwards or downwards? The movement says U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), so y+1 is up, y-1 is down. So (0,0) is bottom-left? But walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top, I assume.\n\nIn the snake positions, head at (5,1), which is near bottom, since y=0 is wall.\n\nPossible moves from (5,1):\n\n- U: up to (5,2)\n\n- D: down to (5,0) but y=0 is wall, so (5,0) is invalid.\n\n- L: left to (4,1)\n\n- R: right to (6,1) but (6,1) is occupied by the body segment, so collision if I move there.\n\nBody segments: (6,1) is the first segment after head, so if I move to (6,1), head touches body, collision, death.\n\nAlso, walls: x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls, so (5,0) is y=0, wall, invalid.\n\nSo from (5,1), possible moves:\n\n- U: (5,2) - but what is at (5,2)? Looking at snake positions, (5,2) is the third segment? Positions: head (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), so (5,2) is occupied by the fourth segment? Let's index:\n\nIndex 0: (5,1) head\n\nIndex 1: (6,1)\n\nIndex 2: (6,2)\n\nIndex 3: (5,2)\n\nSo (5,2) is occupied by index 3, which is body. If I move to (5,2), head at (5,2) and body at (5,2) at the same time? But when I move, the snake moves: head to new position, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n\nImportant: after moving, the tail moves away, so if I move to a cell that was occupied by the tail, it might be safe because the tail leaves that cell.\n\nGeneral rule: if the head moves to a cell that will be empty after the move, it's safe, except if it's a wall or body that doesn't move away.\n\nSpecifically, when moving, the head moves to a new cell, then each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail cell is vacated.\n\nTherefore, a cell that was occupied by the tail might be safe to move into because after the move, the tail leaves.\n\nBut cells occupied by other body segments are not safe because they don't move away immediately.\n\nIn this case, from (5,1), moving to:\n\n- U: (5,2) - currently occupied by index 3: (5,2). After move, where will (5,2) be? Current positions: head to new, say (5,2), then segment 1 (6,1) moves to where head was, (5,1), segment 2 (6,2) moves to where segment 1 was, (6,1), segment 3 (5,2) moves to where segment 2 was, (6,2), and so on.\n\nIf I move head to (5,2), which is currently occupied by segment 3. After move, head is at (5,2), and segment 3 moves to (6,2) or something? Let's simulate.\n\nCurrent positions:\n\n- Head: (5,1)\n\n- Seg1: (6,1)\n\n- Seg2: (6,2)\n\n- Seg3: (5,2)\n\n- ... and so on.\n\nIf I move U to (5,2):\n\n- New head position: (5,2)\n\n- Then seg1 moves to (5,1) (previous head)\n\n- Seg2 moves to (6,1) (previous seg1)\n\n- Seg3 moves to (6,2) (previous seg2)\n\n- But seg3 was at (5,2), which is now the new head position. So when head moves to (5,2), it is the same cell that seg3 is currently at. Since seg3 will move to (6,2) after the move, the cell (5,2) is briefly occupied by both, but in terms of collision, if head moves to a cell that is occupied by any body segment before the move, it's a collision, because at the time of move, the cell is occupied.\n\nThe rules say: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment).\" And \"the head moves onto the food cell.\" So I think collision is checked before the move: if the cell the head is moving to is occupied by a body segment or wall, it's collision.\n\nAfter the move, positions are updated.\n\nSo for moving to (5,2): currently occupied by seg3, so if I move there, head touches body, collision, death. Not safe.\n\nSimilarly, moving D to (5,0): y=0 is wall, so wall collision.\n\nMoving L to (4,1): what is at (4,1)? Current positions: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), ... so (4,1) is not listed, so it should be empty? Positions are only snake, not including walls or food.\n\nLet's list all occupied cells from positions: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5). So (4,1) is not in this list, and it's not a wall (walls are x=0,7 y=0,7 and (4,6)), so (4,1) should be free.\n\nMoving R to (6,1): currently occupied by seg1, so collision.\n\nTherefore, from (5,1), only possible move without immediate death is L to (4,1).\n\nBut I need to check if (4,1) is safe. No body or wall there, so yes.\n\nAlso, cannot move opposite direction: current direction is L, so I cannot move R, but R is not possible anyway.\n\nSo on turn 54, I must move L to (4,1).\n\nIs that the only choice? Yes, because U and D are invalid or collision, R is collision or opposite? R is right, opposite of L, but since it's not possible due to body, but even if possible, I cannot move opposite direction on next turn.\n\nBut here, only L is possible.\n\nHead direction is L, so moving L is fine, not opposite.\n\nMoving U or D would be perpendicular, not opposite.\n\nOpposite would be R.\n\nSo for turn 54, action must be L to (4,1).\n\nNow, after that, head at (4,1), and the snake moves: tail at (5,5) moves away, but since we moved to (4,1), which was free, no issue.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead for multiple turns.\n\nCurrent turn 54, I move L to (4,1).\n\nThen turn 55, head at (4,1), direction? After moving L, the new head direction is L, so I can move U, D, L, but not R.\n\nNow, possible moves from (4,1):\n\n- U to (4,2)\n\n- D to (4,0) but y=0 wall, invalid\n\n- L to (3,1)\n\n- R to (5,1) but (5,1) is now occupied by seg1, which moved to (5,1) after previous move? Let's simulate after turn 54 move.\n\nAfter turn 54:\n\n- Head moves to (4,1)\n\n- Seg1 moves to (5,1) (previous head)\n\n- Seg2 moves to (6,1) (previous seg1)\n\n- Seg3 moves to (6,2) (previous seg2)\n\n- Seg4 moves to (5,2) (previous seg3)\n\n- Seg5 moves to (4,2) (previous seg4)\n\n- Seg6 moves to (3,2) (previous seg5)\n\n- Seg7 moves to (3,3) (previous seg6)\n\n- Seg8 moves to (4,3) (previous seg7)\n\n- Seg9 moves to (5,3) (previous seg8)\n\n- Seg10 moves to (5,4) (previous seg9)\n\n- Seg11 moves to (4,4) (previous seg10)\n\n- Seg12 moves to (4,5) (previous seg11)\n\n- Tail was at (5,5), which is seg12? Positions had 13 cells, index 0 to 12? Head index 0, then 1 to 12.\n\nAfter move, the last segment, seg12 at (5,5) moves to where seg11 was? Let's clarify.\n\nThe snake has positions: let's denote S[0] = head, S[1] to S[12] for body.\n\nAfter move to new head position, S[0] new = (4,1)\n\nThen S[1] new = old S[0] = (5,1)\n\nS[2] new = old S[1] = (6,1)\n\nS[3] new = old S[2] = (6,2)\n\nS[4] new = old S[3] = (5,2)  // seg4 was (5,2) old, now moves to (6,2)? Old S[3] is (5,2), but S[3] new = old S[2] = (6,2)\n\nList old positions before move turn 54:\n\nS[0]: (5,1)\n\nS[1]: (6,1)\n\nS[2]: (6,2)\n\nS[3]: (5,2)\n\nS[4]: (4,2)\n\nS[5]: (3,2)\n\nS[6]: (3,3)\n\nS[7]: (4,3)\n\nS[8]: (5,3)\n\nS[9]: (5,4)\n\nS[10]: (4,4)\n\nS[11]: (4,5)\n\nS[12]: (5,5)  // tail\n\nAfter move to (4,1):\n\nNew S[0]: (4,1)\n\nNew S[1]: old S[0] = (5,1)\n\nNew S[2]: old S[1] = (6,1)\n\nNew S[3]: old S[2] = (6,2)\n\nNew S[4]: old S[3] = (5,2)\n\nNew S[5]: old S[4] = (4,2)\n\nNew S[6]: old S[5] = (3,2)\n\nNew S[7]: old S[6] = (3,3)\n\nNew S[8]: old S[7] = (4,3)\n\nNew S[9]: old S[8] = (5,3)\n\nNew S[10]: old S[9] = (5,4)\n\nNew S[11]: old S[10] = (4,4)\n\nNew S[12]: old S[11] = (4,5)  // new tail, since old S[12] (5,5) is not used, so (5,5) is now free.\n\nOld S[12] was at (5,5), and after move, new S[12] is at old S[11] = (4,5), so (5,5) is vacated.\n\nNow, back to turn 55, head at (4,1), direction L (since we moved left).\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U to (4,2): what is at (4,2)? New positions after turn 54: S[5] is at (4,2)? New S[5] is at (4,2), which is body. S[5] is the fifth segment, so occupied.\n\n- D to (4,0): y=0 wall, invalid\n\n- L to (3,1): is (3,1) occupied? Not in positions, walls? x=0 is wall, but (3,1) x=3>0, y=1>0, not wall, not in snake positions (new positions have (3,2) and (3,3), but not (3,1)), so (3,1) should be free.\n\n- R to (5,1): (5,1) is occupied by new S[1] = (5,1), body segment.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (4,2) occupied by S[5], collision; or L to (3,1) free.\n\nU to (4,2) is occupied, so if I move there, collision.\n\nL to (3,1) is free.\n\nR is invalid or occupied.\n\nSo only possible move is L to (3,1).\n\nBut I can move U? (4,2) is occupied, so no.\n\nPerhaps I can consider if the body moves away, but at the time of move, (4,2) is occupied, so it's not safe.\n\nUnless it's the tail, but here S[5] is not tail, tail is at (4,5).\n\nSo for turn 55, only possible action is L to (3,1).\n\nThen head at (3,1), direction L.\n\nNow, after that, I need to think about food and future moves.\n\nBut let's first outline the immediate path.\n\nFood available:\n\n- (1,3) life span 2 at turn 54, so at turn 55, life span 1, available until turn 55.\n\n- (6,3) life span 5, available turns 54-58\n\n- (2,1) life span 8, available turns 54-61\n\nAt turn 54, head at (5,1), I moved to (4,1), no food eaten.\n\nAt turn 55, if I move to (3,1), then (2,1) is nearby, with food.\n\n(2,1) has food, value 1.\n\nIf I go to (3,1) on turn 55, then from there I can move to (2,1) on turn 56 to eat it.\n\nBut let's see the state.\n\nAlso, (1,3) is almost gone, life span 2 at t54, so at t55 it has life 1, must be eaten by t55.\n\nBut (1,3) is at (1,3), head at (4,1) after t54, or (3,1) after t55, which is far, and I have to move through possible body positions.\n\nLet's think from turn 54 onwards.\n\nTurn 54: must move L to (4,1). No food there.\n\nTurn 55: head at (4,1), must move L to (3,1) as only choice. No food at (3,1).\n\nThen turn 56: head at (3,1), direction L.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U to (3,2)\n\n- D to (3,0) wall, invalid\n\n- L to (2,1)\n\n- R to (4,1) but opposite direction? Current direction L, moving R is opposite, not allowed.\n\nCannot move opposite, so cannot move R.\n\nU to (3,2): what is at (3,2)? After turn 55 move.\n\nFirst, after turn 55 move to (3,1):\n\nCurrent positions before t55: head (4,1), S[1] (5,1), S[2] (6,1), S[3] (6,2), S[4] (5,2), S[5] (4,2), S[6] (3,2), S[7] (3,3), S[8] (4,3), S[9] (5,3), S[10] (5,4), S[11] (4,4), S[12] (4,5)\n\nAfter move to (3,1):\n\nNew head: (3,1)\n\nS[1] new: old head (4,1)\n\nS[2] new: old S[1] (5,1)\n\nS[3] new: old S[2] (6,1)\n\nS[4] new: old S[3] (6,2)\n\nS[5] new: old S[4] (5,2)\n\nS[6] new: old S[5] (4,2)\n\nS[7] new: old S[6] (3,2)\n\nS[8] new: old S[7] (3,3)\n\nS[9] new: old S[8] (4,3)\n\nS[10] new: old S[9] (5,3)\n\nS[11] new: old S[10] (5,4)\n\nS[12] new: old S[11] (4,4)  // new tail at (4,4)\n\nOld S[12] at (4,5) vacated.\n\nNow turn 56, head at (3,1), direction L.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U to (3,2): occupied by S[7] new = (3,2)? S[7] is at (3,2), which is body.\n\n- D: (3,0) wall\n\n- L to (2,1): not occupied? Positions: (2,1) not listed, and not wall, so free.\n\n- R to (4,1): occupied by S[1] new = (4,1), body, and also opposite direction, not allowed.\n\nSo only possible move is L to (2,1).\n\n(2,1) has food! Value 1, and it can be eaten on turn 56.\n\nSo if I move to (2,1) on turn 56, I eat the food, snake grows, so after eating, the tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n\nWhen eating food, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail doesn't move, so a new segment is added.\n\nIn this case, on turn 56, move to (2,1), which has food, so I eat it, head at (2,1), and the body segments move, but tail stays, so new length 14.\n\nThen direction is L.\n\nNow, what about other food? (1,3) has life span 1 at turn 55, but turn 55 I was at (3,1), couldn't reach it. After turn 55, (1,3) has life span 0? At turn 54, (1,3) L=2, after turn 54, L=1, after turn 55, if not eaten, L=0 and disappears.\n\nSo on turn 55, it was available, but I was at (3,1), too far to eat it in one move, and I had to move to (3,1), not towards it. So (1,3) is gone after turn 55.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) is still available.\n\nNow, after eating at (2,1) on turn 56, head at (2,1), direction L.\n\nNow possible moves:\n\n- U to (2,2)\n\n- D to (2,0) wall, invalid\n\n- L to (1,1)\n\n- R to (3,1) but opposite direction, not allowed.\n\nNow, (2,2): is it occupied? Current positions after turn 56 move with growth.\n\nAfter turn 56: head moves to (2,1) and eats food, so tail doesn't move, new segment added.\n\nBefore move, positions: head (3,1), S[1] (4,1), S[2] (5,1), S[3] (6,1), S[4] (6,2), S[5] (5,2), S[6] (4,2), S[7] (3,2), S[8] (3,3), S[9] (4,3), S[10] (5,3), S[11] (5,4), S[12] (4,4)\n\nAfter move to (2,1) with eat:\n\nNew head: (2,1)\n\nNew S[1]: old head (3,1)\n\nNew S[2]: old S[1] (4,1)\n\n...\n\nUp to new S[12]: old S[11] (5,4)? Let's index properly.\n\nAfter move without growth, S[12] would be old S[11] = (4,4)? Old positions before t56:\n\nS[0]: (3,1) head\n\nS[1]: (4,1)\n\nS[2]: (5,1)\n\nS[3]: (6,1)\n\nS[4]: (6,2)\n\nS[5]: (5,2)\n\nS[6]: (4,2)\n\nS[7]: (3,2)\n\nS[8]: (3,3)\n\nS[9]: (4,3)\n\nS[10]: (5,3)\n\nS[11]: (5,4)\n\nS[12]: (4,4)  // tail\n\nAfter moving head to (2,1) and eating food, the tail does not move, so we add a new segment at the tail position, meaning S[12] stays, and we have new S[13] at the previous tail position? No.\n\nTypically, when eating, the head moves to food, and the body moves as usual, but the tail does not advance, so a new segment is added where the tail was or something.\n\nStandard Snake: when you eat, head moves to food, each segment moves to previous position, but the last segment stays, so the snake grows by one.\n\nSo positions: new head at food, then new S[1] at old head, new S[2] at old S[1], ..., new S[k] at old S[k-1], and since tail didn't move, there is a new segment at the old tail position? No.\n\nAfter move, the segments from 1 to len-1 move, but the tail position is not vacated because we add a new segment there.\n\nLet's think.\n\nSuppose before eat, positions: S0, S1, S2, ..., S_{len-1} (tail)\n\nAfter moving to a food cell:\n\n- New S0: the food cell (new head)\n\n- New S1: old S0\n\n- New S2: old S1\n\n- ...\n\n- New S_{len-1}: old S_{len-2}\n\n- New S_{len}: old S_{len-1}  // this is the new tail, so length increases by one.\n\nFor example, before eat, len = L, positions S0 to S_{L-1}\n\nAfter eating:\n\nNew head at food cell.\n\nThen new body: S1 at old S0, S2 at old S1, ..., S_{L-1} at old S_{L-2}, and S_L at old S_{L-1} (tail)\n\nSo the tail cell is not vacated; instead, the snake grows, and the old tail position is still occupied by the new tail.\n\nIn terms of cells, the cell that was tail is now occupied by the new segment S_L, so it's still occupied.\n\nOnly if not eating, the tail vacates.\n\nIn this case, for turn 56, after moving to (2,1) and eating:\n\nNew positions:\n\nNew S0: (2,1) head\n\nNew S1: old S0 = (3,1)\n\nNew S2: old S1 = (4,1)\n\nNew S3: old S2 = (5,1)\n\nNew S4: old S3 = (6,1)\n\nNew S5: old S4 = (6,2)\n\nNew S6: old S5 = (5,2)\n\nNew S7: old S6 = (4,2)\n\nNew S8: old S7 = (3,2)\n\nNew S9: old S8 = (3,3)\n\nNew S10: old S9 = (4,3)\n\nNew S11: old S10 = (5,3)\n\nNew S12: old S11 = (5,4)\n\nNew S13: old S12 = (4,4)  // new tail, since we added a segment.\n\nLength now 14.\n\nNow, head at (2,1), direction L.\n\nBack to possible moves:\n\n- U to (2,2): what is at (2,2)? Not in positions, and not wall, so free? Positions have (3,2), (3,3), etc., but (2,2) not listed, so should be free.\n\n- D: (2,0) wall, invalid\n\n- L to (1,1): (1,1) is not wall? x=1>0, y=1>0, not internal obstacle, so free.\n\n- R to (3,1): but (3,1) is occupied by new S1 = (3,1), body, and also opposite direction, not allowed.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (2,2) or L to (1,1).\n\nBoth seem possible.\n\nNow, I need to think about future food and survival.\n\n(6,3) has food at (6,3), life span 5 at t54, so at t56, life span 3? Turn 54: L=5, after t54: L=4, after t55: L=3, after t56: L=2, etc.\n\nAvailable until t58.\n\nAlso, there might be other food later, but not specified.\n\nNow, head at (2,1), I can go up to (2,2) or left to (1,1).\n\nIf I go left to (1,1), then I am near the left wall.\n\nx=0 is wall, so from (1,1), I can go U to (1,2), D to (1,0) wall, or L to (0,1) wall, or R to (2,1) but (2,1) is head now, but after move, it will be body.\n\nBut moving to (1,1) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) is free.\n\nNow, I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nAlso, there is food at (6,3), which is on the right side.\n\nBut I am at left bottom.\n\nMoreover, there is an internal obstacle at (4,6), but I am at y=1,2, so not immediately affected.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should try to eat (6,3) before it disappears.\n\nBut it's at (6,3), and I am at (2,1) after t56.\n\nAlso, the snake body is spread, so I need to navigate without colliding.\n\nSince I have to think 5+ turns ahead, let's plan a path.\n\nFirst, from (2,1), if I move U to (2,2) on turn 57.\n\nThen head to (2,2), direction U? After moving U, direction is U.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (2,3), (1,2), (3,2), etc.\n\n(3,2) is occupied by body? After t56 positions, S8 is at (3,2), which is body.\n\nAfter t56: S0:(2,1), S1:(3,1), S2:(4,1), S3:(5,1), S4:(6,1), S5:(6,2), S6:(5,2), S7:(4,2), S8:(3,2), S9:(3,3), S10:(4,3), S11:(5,3), S12:(5,4), S13:(4,4)\n\nSo (3,2) is S8, occupied.\n\n(2,3) might be free.\n\n(1,2) might be free.\n\nIf on turn 57 I move U to (2,2):\n\nThen head to (2,2), free.\n\nNew positions: head (2,2), S1: old head (2,1), S2: (3,1), S3: (4,1), ..., up to S13: (5,4)? S13 is tail at (4,4), but after move without eat, tail moves.\n\nNo food at (2,2), so no eat.\n\nAfter move to (2,2):\n\nNew head: (2,2)\n\nNew S1: old S0 = (2,1)\n\nNew S2: old S1 = (3,1)\n\nNew S3: old S2 = (4,1)\n\nNew S4: old S3 = (5,1)\n\nNew S5: old S4 = (6,1)\n\nNew S6: old S5 = (6,2)\n\nNew S7: old S6 = (5,2)\n\nNew S8: old S7 = (4,2)\n\nNew S9: old S8 = (3,2)\n\nNew S10: old S9 = (3,3)\n\nNew S11: old S10 = (4,3)\n\nNew S12: old S11 = (5,3)\n\nNew S13: old S12 = (5,4)  // tail moved, (4,4) vacated? Old S13 at (4,4), now new S13 at (5,4), so (4,4) free.\n\nBut we moved to (2,2), no food.\n\nNow head at (2,2), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,3), D to (2,1) but (2,1) is now S1, body, and D is opposite? Current direction U, D is opposite, not allowed.\n\nL to (1,2), R to (3,2) but (3,2) is occupied by new S9 = (3,2), body.\n\nSo only possible move is U to (2,3) or L to (1,2).\n\n(2,3) and (1,2) both should be free.\n\nIf I go to (2,3), then I can go up, but y=7 is wall, so limited.\n\nIf I go left to (1,2), then to (1,3), but (1,3) food is gone.\n\n(1,3) disappeared after t55.\n\nSo no food there.\n\nNow, back to turn 57 options.\n\nFrom (2,1) at turn 57, I could instead move L to (1,1).\n\nThen head to (1,1), direction L.\n\nThen from there, I can go U to (1,2), or since direction L, cannot R, D to (1,0) wall, L to (0,1) wall.\n\nSo only U to (1,2).\n\nThen similar.\n\nBut going left might corner me.\n\nTo reach (6,3), I need to go right and up.\n\nBut the body is on the right, so I need to avoid colliding.\n\nAfter turn 56, positions: head (2,1), and body from (3,1) to (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)\n\nSo the area around (4,3) to (5,4) has body, and (6,3) is food, which is free.\n\n(6,3) is not occupied, so I can go there.\n\nBut from (2,1), I need to move up or left first.\n\nPerhaps I should go up to avoid the left corner.\n\nLet's plan to go towards (6,3).\n\nFrom (2,1), on turn 57, move U to (2,2).\n\nThen turn 58, from (2,2), I can move U to (2,3) or L to (1,2).\n\nIf I move U to (2,3), then I am at (2,3), direction U.\n\nThen turn 59, from (2,3), possible moves: U to (2,4), D to (2,2) opposite not allowed, L to (1,3) but (1,3) no food or gone, R to (3,3) but (3,3) is occupied by S9 or something, depending on positions.\n\nLet's not simulate too far yet.\n\nI need to think about the tail reward danger.\n\nThe rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn this case, the tail is at (4,4) after t56, and food at (6,3) is not on tail, so no issue.\n\nBut I should be careful.\n\nNow, for the food at (6,3), it has life span 5 at t54, so after t54 L=4, t55 L=3, t56 L=2, t57 L=1, t58 L=0 disappear.\n\nAt turn 56, L=2 for (6,3), so available t56, t57, t58.\n\nI need to eat it by t58.\n\nNow, at turn 56, I am at (2,1), (6,3) is at distance |6-2| + |3-1| = 4+2=6, so 6 cells away, but with body in between, I need a path.\n\nFrom (2,1) to (6,3), I can go via (3,1), but (3,1) is occupied by S1 at t56.\n\nAfter t56, S1 is at (3,1), so I cannot go there immediately.\n\nI can go up to (2,2), then to (2,3), then to (3,3), but (3,3) is S9 at t56.\n\nAfter t56 positions, (3,3) is S9, occupied.\n\n(4,3) is S10, occupied.\n\n(5,3) is S11, occupied.\n\n(6,3) is free.\n\nBut to reach (6,3), I need to approach from adjacent cells: (5,3), (6,2), (6,4), (7,3) but x=7 wall, so (5,3), (6,2), or (6,4).\n\n(6,2) is S5 at (6,2), occupied.\n\n(6,4) might be free.\n\n(5,3) is S11, occupied.\n\nSo the only adjacent cells are occupied except possibly (6,4) or (7,3) wall.\n\n(6,3) adjacent: (6,2), (6,4), (5,3), (7,3)\n\n(7,3) x=7 wall.\n\n(6,2) occupied by S5.\n\n(5,3) occupied by S11.\n\n(6,4) not occupied, should be free.\n\nSo I can move to (6,4) first, then to (6,3).\n\nBut (6,4) is at (6,4), which is not adjacent to current position.\n\nFrom (2,1), I need to go to (3,2) but occupied, etc.\n\nPerhaps a longer path.\n\nFor example, from (2,1) move U to (2,2) on t57.\n\nThen from (2,2) move U to (2,3) on t58.\n\nThen from (2,3) move U to (2,4) on t59.\n\nThen from (2,4) move R to (3,4) on t60.\n\nThen to (4,4), but (4,4) is tail at t56, but will move.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach (6,3) by t58.\n\nt56: at (2,1)\n\nt57: move to (2,2)\n\nt58: move to (2,3)\n\nAt t58, (6,3) L=1, still available, but I am at (2,3), far away.\n\nt59: to (2,4)\n\nt60: to (3,4)\n\nt61: to (4,4) but (4,4) was tail, but at t61, it might be different.\n\nBut (6,3) disappears after t58, so I cannot eat it after t58. At t58 it has L=1, after t58 L=0 gone. So last chance to eat is t58.\n\nAt t58, I am at (2,3) if I go up, which is too far from (6,3), distance |2-6| + |3-3| = 4, not adjacent.\n\nSo I cannot eat (6,3) because I am on the left and it's on the right with body in between, and not enough time to go around.\n\nAt t54, I was at (5,1), and (6,3) is at (6,3), which is close, but at t54, I had to move left to (4,1) because no other choice.\n\nThen at t55 to (3,1), t56 to (2,1) eating food there.\n\nBut (6,3) is only 2 cells away from (5,1), but I couldn't go there because (6,1) and (6,2) are body, so from (5,1), moving U to (5,2) was occupied, D wall, R to (6,1) occupied, so only L possible.\n\nSo I had no choice but to go left.\n\nSo (6,3) is impossible to eat; it will disappear uneaten.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) was impossible.\n\nSo only food I can eat is (2,1) at t56.\n\nNow, after that, I need to survive and look for more food, but no other food is given, so I need to avoid dying.\n\nAfter t56, head at (2,1), I moved U to (2,2) on t57.\n\nThen at t57, head to (2,2), no food.\n\nThen t58, from (2,2), I can move U to (2,3) or L to (1,2).\n\n(1,2) is free, I think.\n\nIf I move U to (2,3), as I said.\n\nThen t59 to (2,4), t60 to (3,4), etc.\n\nBut I need to think about the body.\n\nThe snake is long, and I am going up the left side, but the body is on the right, so I might trap myself.\n\nFor example, if I go to (2,4), then I can go to (3,4), but (3,4) might be free now.\n\nAfter t56, positions up to (5,4), etc.\n\nAs time passes, the tail moves, so cells free up.\n\nFor instance, after t56, tail at (4,4), but as I move, it will change.\n\nTo maximize survival, I should move towards areas with space.\n\nThe grid has internal obstacle at (4,6), but at y=6, I am at low y.\n\nAvailable space: left bottom is free, but I am there.\n\nFrom (2,1), after eating, I can move to (1,1) on t57 instead of (2,2).\n\nLet's consider that.\n\nTurn 57: from (2,1), move L to (1,1).\n\nThen head to (1,1), direction L.\n\nThen turn 58: only move U to (1,2) (since D wall, L wall, R to (2,1) occupied and opposite).\n\nMove U to (1,2).\n\nThen head at (1,2), direction U.\n\nThen turn 59: move U to (1,3) but (1,3) food gone, but cell free? Or move R to (2,2), etc.\n\n(1,3) should be free now.\n\nBut no food.\n\nThen I can go to (1,4), etc.\n\nBut going left and up might corner me at left wall.\n\nWhereas if I go up from (2,1) to (2,2), then to (2,3), I can go to (2,4), then to (3,4), (4,4) but (4,4) was tail, but at that time it might be free.\n\nLet's think 5 turns ahead from t54.\n\nTurn 54: move L to (4,1)\n\nTurn 55: move L to (3,1)\n\nTurn 56: move L to (2,1) and eat food (since (2,1) has food)\n\nNow, for turn 57, from (2,1), I have two choices: U or L.\n\nIf I move U to (2,2), then direction U.\n\nThen turn 58: from (2,2), I can move U to (2,3) or L to (1,2)\n\nIf I move U to (2,3), then at (2,3), direction U.\n\nThen turn 59: move U to (2,4) (since D opposite not allowed, L to (1,3), R to (3,3) but (3,3) occupied? At that time, it might not be.\n\nI need to simulate positions.\n\nBut it's messy; perhaps I can assume that as the snake moves, the body moves, so some cells free up.\n\nTo avoid risk, moving U to (2,2) might be better than moving L to (1,1) because at (1,1), I have only one way out, to (1,2), then from (1,2) to (1,3) or (2,2), but (2,2) might be occupied later.\n\nAt turn 57, if I move L to (1,1), then turn 58 move U to (1,2), then turn 59 from (1,2) I can move U to (1,3) or R to (2,2) if free.\n\nBut at turn 59, (2,2) might be free.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (2,2) first, I have more options.\n\nSo for survival, moving up is better than moving left.\n\nThen for turn 57, move U to (2,2).\n\nThen turn 58, from (2,2), I can move U to (2,3) or L to (1,2).\n\n(1,2) is also free, and moving L to (1,2) might give me space to go up later.\n\nBut let's see the answer format.\n\nI need to provide actions for several turns.\n\nThe current turn is t1=54, so I need to output actions for turn 54, 55, 56, etc., at least 5 turns.\n\nBut since the state might change, I can plan for the next few.\n\nAlso, after eating at (2,1), no more food specified, so I just need to survive.\n\nBut new food might spawn, but not in the state, so I assume only these for now.\n\nFor the purpose of this, I can provide actions up to turn 58 or so.\n\nTurn 54: move L (only choice)\n\nTurn 55: move L (only choice)\n\nTurn 56: move L to (2,1) and eat\n\nThen turn 57: move U to (2,2)\n\nTurn 58: from (2,2), move U to (2,3)\n\nOr move L to (1,2).\n\nTo keep options open, move U to (2,3).\n\nThen turn 59: from (2,3), move U to (2,4)\n\n Etc.\n\nBut I need to specify.\n\nSince the food at (6,3) is not reachable, and (2,1) is eaten, I can just focus on survival.\n\nFor the answer, I can say:\n\nTurn 54: L\n\nTurn 55: L\n\nTurn 56: L (eats food)\n\nTurn 57: U\n\nTurn 58: U\n\nBut on turn 58, from (2,2) after t57, if I moved U to (2,2) on t57, then at t58 from (2,2), moving U to (2,3) is possible.\n\nSimilarly, turn 59: U to (2,4)\n\nBut y=7 wall, so at (2,4), I can go to (3,4), etc.\n\nBut to be precise.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (4,6), but it's at y=6, I am at y=1-4, so not immediate issue.\n\nSo for now, the actions are determined for the first few turns.\n\nBut on turn 57, I have a choice between U and L.\n\nSince moving L to (1,1) might lead to dead end faster, I think U is better for long-term survival.\n\nSimilarly, on turn 58 from (2,2), moving U to (2,3) or L to (1,2).\n\nIf I move L to (1,2), then I am on left wall, which might be riskier.\n\nSo I should move U to (2,3).\n\nThen similarly up.\n\nSo let's outline:\n\nTurn 54: L\n\nTurn 55: L\n\nTurn 56: L (eats food at (2,1))\n\nThen for turn 57, from (2,1), move U to (2,2)\n\nTurn 58, from (2,2), move U to (2,3)\n\nTurn 59, from (2,3), move U to (2,4)  // since D opposite not allowed, only U or L or R, but R to (3,3) might be occupied? At that point, it might not be, but I can move U.\n\nAt turn 59, from (2,3), after previous moves.\n\nBut I think it's fine.\n\nTo think 5+ turns, from t54 to t59.\n\nt54: move L\n\nt55: move L\n\nt56: move L\n\nt57: move U\n\nt58: move U\n\nt59: move U  to (2,4)\n\nBut at (2,4), y=4, not near wall yet.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to box the actions.\n\nAlso, the head direction changes.\n\nBut I think for the actions, I can list them.\n\nIn the state, head direction is given, but for future, I need to keep track.\n\nBut in answer, just the action.\n\nSo for turn 54: L\n\nTurn 55: L\n\nTurn 56: L\n\nThen turn 57: U (from (2,1) to (2,2))\n\nTurn 58: U (from (2,2) to (2,3))\n\nTurn 59: U (from (2,3) to (2,4))\n\nBut on turn 59, from (2,3), after moving U on t58, direction U, so at t59, I can move U to (2,4), or L to (1,3), or R to (3,3).\n\nIf (3,3) is free, I could move R, but to avoid body, moving U might be safer.\n\nSince no food, it doesn't matter much.\n\nBut for long-term, moving right might explore more space.\n\nAfter t56, as I move up, the body on the right will move, so cells free up.\n\nFor example, at t59, (3,3) might be free.\n\nBut to simplify, I can stick with up.\n\nPerhaps for the first 5 turns from now.\n\nTurn 54 to 58.\n\nt54: L\n\nt55: L\n\nt56: L\n\nt57: U\n\nt58: U\n\nThat's 5 actions.\n\nt54,55,56,57,58.\n\nFrom t54 to t58 is 5 turns: 54,55,56,57,58.\n\nActions: L, L, L, U, U\n\nBut on t57 and t58, I moved U.\n\nt57 from (2,1) to (2,2), t58 from (2,2) to (2,3).\n\nYes.\n\nIf on t57 I moved L to (1,1), then t58 U to (1,2), but that might be worse.\n\nSo I think U is better.\n\nAlso, in the core rules, food can spawn under body, but not here, so no issue.\n\nSo I think this is the plan.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score and ensure long-term survival, the AI must carefully plan its moves at least 5 turns ahead, considering the current state and constraints. The current state (turn 54) shows the snake at positions [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5)] with head direction L (left). Food is available at (1,3) (value 1, life span 2), (6,3) (value 1, life span 5), and (2,1) (value 1, life span 8). Walls are at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\n### Analysis of Current Turn (54) and Immediate Constraints:\n- **Turn 54 (current head at (5,1), direction L):**  \n  Possible moves:  \n  - U (up to (5,2)): Occupied by body segment (5,2), leading to collision.  \n  - D (down to (5,0)): y=0 is a wall, invalid.  \n  - L (left to (4,1)): Free (no wall or body), safe.  \n  - R (right to (6,1)): Occupied by body segment (6,1), leading to collision; also, opposite direction to current L, which is not allowed.  \n  Only safe move is L to (4,1). No food at (4,1).  \n\n### Food Availability and Long-Term Planning:\n- **(1,3)**: Life span 2 at turn 54, so available until turn 55 (after turn 55, life span 0, disappears). However, the snake is at (4,1) after turn 54 and (3,1) after turn 55—too far to reach (1,3) by turn 55. Thus, this food is unreachable and will disappear uneaten.  \n- **(6,3)**: Life span 5 at turn 54, available until turn 58. After turn 54, the snake moves away from this area due to forced left moves. By turn 56, the snake is at (2,1), and (6,3) is 4 cells away with body obstacles (e.g., (6,2), (5,3) occupied). Reaching (6,3) by turn 58 requires 3+ moves through occupied cells, which is impossible without collision. Thus, this food is also unreachable.  \n- **(2,1)**: Life span 8 at turn 54, available until turn 61. At turn 56, the snake can reach (2,1) and eat it, as it is adjacent and free. Eating this adds +1 to score and increases snake length to 14.  \n\n### Turn-by-Turn Plan (5+ Turns Ahead):\nThe plan prioritizes eating the reachable food at (2,1) on turn 56 while avoiding collisions and dead ends. After eating, the snake moves upward to open space for long-term survival, as moving left could lead to a dead end near the wall. Actions are chosen to:\n- Avoid immediate risks (walls, body collisions).\n- Comply with movement constraints (no instant reverse).\n- Maximize score by eating (2,1).\n- Ensure survival by navigating to less cluttered areas (right and up from (2,1) has more space, while left risks trapping).\n\n**Simulated Path (turns 54-59):**  \n- **Turn 54:** Move L to (4,1). Head now at (4,1), direction L.  \n- **Turn 55:** From (4,1), only safe move is L to (3,1) (U to (4,2) occupied, D to (4,0) wall, R to (5,1) occupied and opposite). Head at (3,1), direction L.  \n- **Turn 56:** From (3,1), only safe move is L to (2,1) (U to (3,2) occupied, D to (3,0) wall, R to (4,1) occupied and opposite). (2,1) has food, so eat it (+1 score, length 14). Head at (2,1), direction L.  \n- **Turn 57:** From (2,1), possible moves:  \n  - U to (2,2): Free, safe.  \n  - L to (1,1): Free, but near left wall (x=0), which risks dead end.  \n  U is chosen for better long-term survival (more space upward). Move U to (2,2). Head at (2,2), direction U.  \n- **Turn 58:** From (2,2), possible moves:  \n  - U to (2,3): Free, safe.  \n  - L to (1,2): Free, but continues toward left wall risk.  \n  U is chosen to continue upward exploration. Move U to (2,3). Head at (2,3), direction U.  \n- **Turn 59 (beyond 5 turns, for completeness):** From (2,3), direction U. Possible moves:  \n  - U to (2,4): Free, safe (y=4 < 7, no wall).  \n  - L to (1,3): Free but near wall.  \n  - R to (3,3): May be occupied initially, but body moves over time; U is safer.  \n  Move U to (2,4) to maintain options.  \n\nThis plan eats one food (+1 score) and avoids all risks for at least 5 turns. Beyond turn 59, the snake should continue navigating open areas (e.g., toward (3,4) or (4,4)) as body segments clear, ensuring survival.\n\n### Final Answer Format:\n\\boxed{\nTurn 54: L (left)  \nTurn 55: L (left)  \nTurn 56: L (left)  \nTurn 57: U (up)  \nTurn 58: U (up)  \n}\n```",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. The grid is 8x8 because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) to (7,7) inclusive? Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. Let me confirm.\n\nWalls: Border cells x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. Also, an internal obstacle at (4,6). So the snake can only be on cells from (1,1) to (6,6), except where obstacles are.\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (4,1), and direction is L (left). So current direction is left.\n\nSnake body: [(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5)]\n\nLet me list the positions in order: head (4,1), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5). So tail is at (4,5).\n\nFood:\n\n- (1,3) with value 1, life span 1\n\n- (6,3) with value 1, life span 4\n\n- (2,1) with value 1, life span 7\n\n- (1,5) with value 1, life span 10\n\nAll food has value 1, so all positive food? The value is given as 1, and it says \"value\" for each, and in the rules, positive food has +1, negative has -1. Here all are 1, so all positive. Life span: for (1,3) it's 1, meaning it disappears after this turn if not eaten? Life span decreases every turn, including current. Current turn is 55, so for (1,3), life span 1, if not eaten now, it disappears after turn 55, so it's only available this turn.\n\nLife span: disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So for food with life span L at turn T, it will disappear at the end of turn T + L - 1? Let's think.\n\nIf life span is N at turn T, it means it has N turns left, including turn T. So after N turns, it disappears. For example, if N=1 at turn T, it disappears after turn T, so it can be eaten on turn T only.\n\nSimilarly, N=4 at turn 55, it can be eaten from turn 55 to turn 58, and disappears after turn 58.\n\nTurn numbers: current turn is 55.\n\nFood at (1,3): life span 1, so must be eaten this turn (turn 55) or it's gone.\n\n(6,3): life span 4, so available until turn 58.\n\n(2,1): life span 7, available until turn 61.\n\n(1,5): life span 10, available until turn 64.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for the next few turns, thinking 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and prioritize survival.\n\nFirst, where is the snake head? At (4,1), direction L, so it just moved left to (4,1)? Positions: from (5,1) to (4,1), since head was at (5,1) before moving left to (4,1)? Snake positions are given as current positions, so head is at (4,1), which it just moved to, and direction is L, meaning it came from the right, so previous head was at (5,1).\n\nNow, possible moves from (4,1): since direction is L, it can move U (up), D (down), L (left), but not R (right) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nCurrent direction is L, so cannot move R (right). Can move U, D, or L.\n\nNow, adjacent cells:\n\n- Up: (4,2)\n\n- Down: (4,0) but y=0 is wall, so not possible.\n\n- Left: (3,1)\n\n- Right: (5,1) but cannot move right because opposite direction.\n\nAlso, walls: y=0 is wall, so (4,0) is invalid.\n\nx=0 and x=7 walls, but (3,1) is x=3, y=1, which should be within bounds? Playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except obstacles.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6. y=0 and y=7 walls, so y from 1 to 6.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSo (4,1): possible moves:\n\n- U: to (4,2)\n\n- D: to (4,0) but y=0 wall, invalid\n\n- L: to (3,1)\n\n- R: to (5,1) but cannot, instant reverse.\n\nSo only possible moves: U or L.\n\nNow, check what is at (4,2) and (3,1).\n\nFirst, (4,2): is this occupied? Snake positions: let's list all snake cells.\n\nSnake: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nSo (4,2) is part of the snake body. Specifically, it's the 6th segment? Positions: index 0: head (4,1), 1: (5,1), 2: (6,1), 3: (6,2), 4: (5,2), 5: (4,2), 6: (3,2), etc.\n\nSo (4,2) is occupied by the snake body. If I move to (4,2), it would be a collision because the head would touch the body segment there.\n\nRule: body collision if head touches any body segment. But exception: it can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will move.\n\nTail segment is at (4,5). When the snake moves, the tail moves, so if head moves to a cell that was tail, it's ok because tail moves away.\n\nBut here, (4,2) is not the tail; it's a body segment. Let's see the movement.\n\nWhen snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail is removed unless food eaten.\n\nSo if head moves to a cell, it must not be occupied by any body segment except possibly the tail, but only if that cell becomes free after tail moves.\n\nStandard rule: after moving, if head is in a cell that was occupied by the body before the move, it collides, except if it was the tail cell, because tail moves.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (4,2), which is currently occupied by the snake body (segment at index 5), after move, head would be there, but that cell was occupied before, and it's not the tail, so it should be a collision.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1): is it occupied? Look at snake positions: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), etc. (3,1) is not in the list, so probably empty.\n\nList all occupied cells: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nSo (3,1) is not occupied, so moving there should be safe.\n\n(4,2) is occupied, so moving there would cause collision.\n\nAlso, walls: (4,2) is within bounds, no wall there.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), not relevant here.\n\nSo from (4,1), moving U to (4,2) is death, collision.\n\nMoving L to (3,1) is safe.\n\nMoving D to (4,0) is wall, invalid.\n\nMoving R not allowed.\n\nSo only possible move is L to (3,1).\n\nBut is that right? What about other directions? I think I covered.\n\nBut let's confirm the grid.\n\nGrid: rows y from 1 to 6, columns x from 1 to 6.\n\n(4,1): x=4, y=1.\n\nU: (4,2) - occupied by snake, body segment.\n\nL: (3,1) - free.\n\nD: (4,0) - y=0, wall.\n\nR: (5,1) - occupied by snake, and also instant reverse not allowed.\n\n(5,1) is occupied by the second segment.\n\nSo indeed, only possible move is L to (3,1).\n\nBut the food at (2,1) is close, with life span 7, so we can get it later.\n\nBut first, we have to move to (3,1) now, I think, because no choice.\n\nBut is there a way? Perhaps I missed something.\n\nFood at (1,3) must be eaten this turn, but it's at (1,3), we are at (4,1), too far, can't reach in one move, so impossible to eat it this turn. So it will disappear after this turn.\n\nSimilarly, other food.\n\nSo for turn 55, we must move to (3,1), since it's the only safe move.\n\nThen, after moving, snake head at (3,1), and direction is now L, since we moved left.\n\nSnake positions after move: head moves to (3,1), then body: the segment that was at (4,1) moves to where? The positions: after move, head is new position (3,1), then the first body segment moves to the old head position (4,1), then (5,1) moves to (4,1)? Let's sequence.\n\nCurrent positions before move: [ (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5) ]\n\nAfter move left to (3,1):\n\nHead to (3,1)\n\nThen, the body segments: the segment that was at index 1, (5,1), moves to the old head position? No.\n\nThe snake body follows: each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo: new head: (3,1)\n\nThen, the segment that was at (4,1) moves to (4,1)? No.\n\nStandard: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the segment ahead of it.\n\nSo: new head: (3,1)\n\nThen, the first body segment (previously at (5,1)) moves to the old head position (4,1)\n\nThen, second body segment (previously at (6,1)) moves to (5,1)\n\nThen, third ( (6,2) ) moves to (6,1)? No.\n\nLet's index:\n\nBefore move: positions P0 = (4,1), P1 = (5,1), P2 = (6,1), P3 = (6,2), P4 = (5,2), P5 = (4,2), P6 = (3,2), P7 = (3,3), P8 = (4,3), P9 = (5,3), P10 = (5,4), P11 = (4,4), P12 = (4,5)\n\nAfter move, head to new position, say Q.\n\nThen new positions: Q, P0, P1, P2, ..., P11 (since tail moves, unless food eaten)\n\nSince no food eaten, tail is removed.\n\nSo new head: (3,1)\n\nThen new body: P0 = (4,1), P1 = (5,1), P2 = (6,1), P3 = (6,2), P4 = (5,2), P5 = (4,2), P6 = (3,2), P7 = (3,3), P8 = (4,3), P9 = (5,3), P10 = (5,4), P11 = (4,4)\n\nP12 is tail, not included.\n\nSo new snake: [(3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)]\n\nTail is now at (4,4), since P11 was (4,4), and P12 (4,5) is gone.\n\nPositions: head (3,1), then (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)\n\nSo (4,4) is tail.\n\nNow, direction: we moved L, so new head direction is L.\n\nNow turn 56.\n\nPossible moves from (3,1):\n\nCurrent direction L.\n\nCan move U, D, L, not R (reverse).\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\nU: (3,2)\n\nD: (3,0) wall, invalid\n\nL: (2,1)\n\nR: (4,1) but cannot, reverse.\n\nNow, (3,2): is it occupied? Snake positions: (3,2) is in the list, it's the 7th segment? New positions: index 0: (3,1), 1: (4,1), 2: (5,1), 3: (6,1), 4: (6,2), 5: (5,2), 6: (4,2), 7: (3,2), 8: (3,3), 9: (4,3), 10: (5,3), 11: (5,4), 12: (4,4)\n\nSo (3,2) is index 7, body segment.\n\nIf move U to (3,2), it would be collision, since not tail.\n\n(2,1): is it occupied? Not in list, so free.\n\nAlso, food at (2,1) is there, with value 1, life span 7, so available.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (3,2) death, or L to (2,1) safe and has food.\n\nSo we should move L to (2,1) to eat the food.\n\nEating food: when head moves to food, length increases, so tail doesn't move, new segment added.\n\nFood at (2,1), value 1, positive.\n\nSo if we move to (2,1), we eat it, snake grows.\n\nNow, after move: head to (2,1), then since food eaten, the tail stays, so new positions: head (2,1), then previous head (3,1) becomes body, and all segments, with tail not removed.\n\nBefore move: positions [ (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4) ]\n\nAfter move to (2,1) and eat food: new head (2,1), then the body: (3,1), (4,1), ..., up to (4,4), and a new segment is added where the tail was? No.\n\nWhen food eaten, head moves to food, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail doesn't move.\n\nSo new positions: head (2,1), then the first body segment is old head (3,1), then (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4) and since food eaten, a new tail segment is added at the old tail position (4,4), so now the snake is longer.\n\nThe new tail is (4,4), but since we add a segment, the positions are: [ (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4) ] and the new segment is at (4,4), but (4,4) was already there, so it stays, and the segment before that is (5,4), etc.\n\nLet's list:\n\nAfter move: head to (2,1)\n\nThe body segments remain where they are, but each shifts: the segment that was at P0 ( (3,1) ) becomes the first body segment, position still (3,1)? No.\n\nIn terms of positions: the head moves to new cell (2,1). Then, the previous positions of the body segments are kept, but since food eaten, the tail doesn't move, so we add a new segment at the tail position.\n\nStandard: after moving and eating, the new snake has head at new position, and all previous segments, so the length increases by one.\n\nSo previous positions: [ (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4) ]\n\nAfter moving head to (2,1) and eating, new positions: [ (2,1) ] + [ (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4) ] \n\nSo now snake has 14 segments: head (2,1), then (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)\n\nTail at (4,4).\n\nDirection: we moved left, so new direction L.\n\nNow, turn 56 action: move L to (2,1)\n\nBut we need to output for multiple turns.\n\nFirst, for turn 55, we must move L to (3,1)\n\nThen turn 56, move L to (2,1) to eat food.\n\nBut we need to think ahead.\n\nAfter that, at turn 56, head at (2,1), direction L.\n\nNow, possible moves for next turn.\n\nBut let's plan further.\n\nFood: (1,3) was gone after turn 55, since life span 1 not eaten.\n\n(6,3) still available, life span 4, from turn 55, so at turn 56, life span decreases to 3, available until eaten or turn 58.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) we just ate, so gone.\n\n(1,5) available.\n\nNow at (2,1), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, not R.\n\nAdjacent: U: (2,2) - is it occupied? Snake positions: (2,1) head, (3,1), (4,1), etc. (2,2) not in list, so free.\n\nD: (2,0) wall, invalid\n\nL: (1,1) - x=1, y=1, should be within bounds? x=1 is ok, not wall, walls x=0 and x=7.\n\ny=1 ok.\n\n(1,1) is not occupied, free.\n\nR: (3,1) but occupied by body, and reverse not allowed? Direction is L, moving R would be opposite, so not allowed.\n\nSo possible: U to (2,2) or L to (1,1)\n\nNow, which to choose.\n\nWe need to think about future moves and food.\n\nFood available: (6,3) at (6,3), value 1, life span 3 left? At turn 56, since life span was 4 at turn 55, after turn 55, life span decreases to 3, so 3 turns left including turn 56.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) at (1,5), life span 10 at turn 55, at turn 56, life span 9 left.\n\nAlso, no other food.\n\nNow, from (2,1), if we move U to (2,2), then we can go towards (1,5) or other areas.\n\nIf move L to (1,1), then we are at left edge.\n\nLet's think about the map.\n\nGrid: x 1 to 6, y 1 to 6.\n\nInternal wall at (4,6), but (4,6) is wall, so cannot go there.\n\nSnake body: current positions after turn 56: head (2,1), body: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)\n\nSo occupied cells: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)\n\nFree cells except these and walls.\n\nNow, from (2,1), move U to (2,2) or L to (1,1).\n\n(1,1) is free, and no food there.\n\nIf we move L to (1,1), then head at (1,1), direction L.\n\nThen from there, possible moves: U, D, L? L would be to (0,1) wall, invalid. D to (1,0) wall. U to (1,2). R to (2,1) but reverse not allowed? Direction is L, moving R is opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo only U to (1,2).\n\n(1,2) is free? Not occupied, yes.\n\nThen from (1,2), we can go U to (1,3) or R to (2,2), etc.\n\nBut (1,3) had food, but it disappeared after turn 55, so no food there now.\n\nSimilarly, moving to (1,1) might lead to dead end or limited options.\n\nIf from (2,1) we move U to (2,2), then head at (2,2), direction U (since we moved up).\n\nThen from (2,2), can move U, D, L, R? Direction U, so cannot move D (down), opposite.\n\nAdjacent: U: (2,3), D: (2,1) but occupied and reverse not allowed, L: (1,2), R: (3,2)\n\n(3,2) is occupied, body segment.\n\n(2,3) free? Not in snake positions.\n\n(1,2) free.\n\nSo from (2,2), can move U to (2,3) or L to (1,2).\n\nNow, (1,5) is at (1,5), so moving left might be towards it.\n\nBut let's think about (6,3) which has shorter life span.\n\n(6,3) at (6,3), life span 3 left at turn 56, so we have until turn 58 to eat it.\n\nCurrently at (2,1) after turn 56 move.\n\nTurn 56 we are moving to (2,1) by eating food.\n\nThen turn 57: from (2,1), we need to choose.\n\nTo reach (6,3) quickly, we need to go right.\n\nBut from (2,1), if we move U to (2,2), then we can go to (3,2), but (3,2) is occupied.\n\nAfter turn 56, positions: head at (2,1), body (3,1), (4,1), etc., (3,2) is occupied.\n\nFrom (2,1), moving U to (2,2) is possible, then from (2,2), we can move R to (3,2)? (3,2) is occupied, so cannot.\n\nMove L to (1,2), then from (1,2), can move U to (1,3) or R to (2,2), etc.\n\nBut (1,3) no food, and we are going away from (6,3).\n\n(6,3) is at (6,3), we are at (2,1), so to reach it, we need to go right and up.\n\nBut the snake body is blocking the way.\n\nFor example, cells around (3,2) to (5,3) are occupied.\n\nSpecifically, to go from (2,1) to (6,3), possible path: (2,1) to (3,1) but (3,1) is occupied, so cannot.\n\n(2,1) to (2,2), then to (3,2) but occupied, or to (1,2), then to (1,3), etc.\n\nThe only free cells near are (2,2), (1,2), (1,1), but (1,1) we can go to.\n\nBut (3,1) is occupied, (4,1) occupied, so the bottom row is blocked from x=2 to x=6 except (1,1) is free.\n\nFrom (2,1), we can only go to (2,2) or (1,1).\n\nIf go to (1,1), then to (1,2), then to (1,3), then to (1,4), then to (1,5) to eat food there.\n\n(1,5) has food, life span 10, so no rush.\n\n(6,3) has only 3 turns left, including turn 56? Turn 56 action will be taken, so after turn 56, life span decreases.\n\nLet's clarify the turns.\n\nAt the start of turn 55, state given, we take action for turn 55.\n\nAfter action, turn 55 ends, food life span decrease.\n\nThen turn 56, we take action, and so on.\n\nFor food (6,3): at turn 55, life span 4, so it can be eaten on turns 55,56,57,58. Disappears after turn 58.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 56, life span 3, meaning 3 turns left including turn 56.\n\nAt turn 55, we didn't eat it, so at turn 56, it is still there with life span 3.\n\nIf we eat it on turn 56, life span decreases to 3 but we eat it, so ok.\n\nBut we are at (2,1) after turn 56 action, which is after moving to (2,1) on turn 56.\n\nLet's sequence the turns.\n\nTurn 55: we move to (3,1), no food eaten, so food at (1,3) disappears after this turn since life span 1 not eaten.\n\nThen turn 56: we move to (2,1) and eat the food there, so we grow.\n\nNow at the beginning of turn 57, head at (2,1), direction L.\n\nFood: (6,3) with life span 3 (available turns 57,58,59? At turn 55, life span 4, after turn 55, life span 3; after turn 56, life span 2; after turn 57, life span 1; after turn 58, disappears.\n\nSo can be eaten on turns 57,58,59? Turn numbers.\n\nTurn 55: life span 4\n\nAfter turn 55 action, life span decreases to 3 for turn 56.\n\nAt turn 56, if not eaten, after turn 56, life span 2 for turn 57.\n\nAt turn 57, if not eaten, after turn 57, life span 1 for turn 58.\n\nAt turn 58, if not eaten, after turn 58, life span 0, disappears.\n\nSo can be eaten on turn 56,57,58.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAt turn 57, we are at (2,1) with direction L.\n\nFrom (2,1), we can move U to (2,2) or L to (1,1).\n\nIf we move L to (1,1) on turn 57, then head to (1,1), direction L.\n\nThen turn 58: from (1,1), only can move U to (1,2), since other directions invalid or reverse.\n\nMove U to (1,2), direction U.\n\nThen turn 59: from (1,2), can move U to (1,3), or R to (2,2), or L to (0,2) wall invalid, D to (1,1) reverse not allowed.\n\nSo U or R.\n\n(1,3) no food, (2,2) may be free.\n\nBut (6,3) must be eaten by turn 58, so by turn 58, we need to be at (6,3).\n\nFrom (1,2) on turn 59, it's too late, turn 58 is the last chance if not eaten earlier.\n\nTurn 58 is one of the chances.\n\nBut we are far away.\n\nIf on turn 57 from (2,1) we move U to (2,2), then head at (2,2), direction U.\n\nThen turn 58: from (2,2), can move U to (2,3), or L to (1,2), or R to (3,2) but (3,2) occupied, so only U or L.\n\nSay move U to (2,3), then to (2,4), etc, still not to (6,3).\n\nTo reach (6,3) quickly, we need to go through the top or middle, but the snake body is blocking the bottom rows.\n\nFor example, row y=1: cells (1,1) free, (2,1) head, (3,1) body, (4,1) body, (5,1) body, (6,1) body.\n\ny=2: (1,2) free, (2,2) free? If not occupied, (3,2) body, (4,2) body, (5,2) body, (6,2) body.\n\ny=3: (1,3) free (food gone), (2,3) free, (3,3) body, (4,3) body, (5,3) body, (6,3) food.\n\ny=4: (1,4) free, (2,4) free, (3,4) free? Not occupied, (4,4) tail, (5,4) body, (6,4) free? Let's list free cells.\n\nOccupied: from snake: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)\n\nSo (4,4) is tail, but occupied.\n\nFree cells: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,5), (4,6) but (4,6) wall, (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), etc.\n\n(1,5) has food.\n\nTo reach (6,3) from (2,1), the shortest path might be via (2,2) if free, but (2,2) is free, then to (3,2) but occupied, so not possible.\n\nFrom (2,1) to (2,2) to (2,3) to (3,3) but (3,3) occupied, to (4,3) occupied, etc.\n\nThe only way is to go up to y=4 or higher.\n\nFor example, from (2,1) move U to (2,2), then U to (2,3), then R to (3,3) but (3,3) occupied, cannot.\n\nMove from (2,2) L to (1,2), then U to (1,3), then U to (1,4), then R to (2,4), then R to (3,4), etc.\n\nBut (3,4) is free, then to (4,4) but (4,4) is tail, so we can move there if it's the only way, but when we move, the tail moves, so it might be safe.\n\nBut to reach (6,3) by turn 58, we have turn 57 and 58 actions.\n\nAt turn 57, from (2,1), if we move U to (2,2), then turn 58 from (2,2), we can move U to (2,3), then we are at (2,3) on turn 58, still not close to (6,3).\n\nFrom (2,2) on turn 58, move R to (3,2) but (3,2) occupied, death.\n\nOr move L to (1,2), then at (1,2) on turn 58.\n\nThen turn 59 from (1,2), but turn 59 is too late for (6,3), since last chance turn 58.\n\nTurn 58: if not eaten by end of turn 58, it disappears.\n\nSo on turn 58, we need to be at (6,3) to eat it.\n\nAt turn 57, we are at (2,1).\n\nFrom (2,1) to (6,3) in one move? Impossible, Manhattan distance |6-2| + |3-1| = 4+2=6, too far.\n\nIn two moves, from turn 57 to turn 58.\n\nTurn 57 action: move to a cell, then turn 58 move to (6,3).\n\nFrom (2,1), in one move, we can go to (2,2) or (1,1).\n\nFrom (2,2), we can go to (2,3), (1,2), or (3,2) but (3,2) occupied.\n\nNone of these are (6,3).\n\nFrom (1,1), we can go to (1,2), not to (6,3).\n\nSo it is impossible to reach (6,3) by turn 58 from our position at turn 57.\n\nBecause at best, after turn 57, we are at (2,2) or (1,1) or (1,2), all far from (6,3).\n\nFor example, from (2,2) to (6,3) requires at least 4 moves right and 1 up, but with obstacles, it's more.\n\nBut in any case, not possible in one move on turn 58.\n\nTherefore, we cannot eat the food at (6,3); it will disappear unused.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 55 and 56, we were not close, so it's gone.\n\nSo we should focus on the other food, (1,5), which has life span 10, so plenty of time.\n\nAlso, there might be new food spawning, but we don't know, so we have to work with current state.\n\nSo for now, at turn 57, from (2,1), we should move towards (1,5).\n\n(1,5) is at (1,5), so moving left and up is good.\n\nSo from (2,1), move L to (1,1) on turn 57.\n\nThen turn 58: from (1,1), move U to (1,2) (only choice, as before).\n\nDirection: after moving L to (1,1), direction L.\n\nThen turn 58: from (1,1), move U to (1,2), so direction U.\n\nThen turn 59: from (1,2), can move U to (1,3), or R to (2,2), since D and L invalid or reverse.\n\n(1,3) no food, but we can go up to (1,4), (1,5).\n\n(1,5) has food.\n\nSo move U to (1,3) on turn 59.\n\nThen turn 60: from (1,3), move U to (1,4)\n\nThen turn 61: from (1,4), move U to (1,5) and eat food.\n\n(1,5) life span 10 at turn 55, at turn 61, let's see how many turns passed.\n\nAt turn 55, life span 10, after each turn decreases.\n\nAfter turn 55: 9 left for turn 56\n\nAfter turn 56: 8 left for turn 57\n\nAfter turn 57: 7 left for turn 58\n\nAfter turn 58: 6 left for turn 59\n\nAfter turn 59: 5 left for turn 60\n\nAfter turn 60: 4 left for turn 61\n\nAfter turn 61: 3 left, but if we eat on turn 61, it's fine.\n\nLife span decreases after each turn, including when we eat or not.\n\nAt turn 61, we move to (1,5), eat it, so it's consumed.\n\nNow, back to the actions.\n\nFirst, for turn 55: we must move L to (3,1)\n\nThen turn 56: move L to (2,1) to eat food at (2,1)\n\nThen turn 57: from (2,1), move L to (1,1)\n\nThen turn 58: from (1,1), move U to (1,2)\n\nThen turn 59: from (1,2), move U to (1,3)\n\nThen turn 60: from (1,3), move U to (1,4)\n\nThen turn 61: from (1,4), move U to (1,5) and eat food.\n\nBut the problem asks to think 5+ turns ahead, and output actions starting from turn t1=55.\n\nAlso, in the sequence, we need to consider if there are risks.\n\nIn this path, when moving from (1,4) to (1,5), is there danger? (1,5) might be under body, but in this case, at that time, the snake body may be elsewhere.\n\nLet's simulate the positions.\n\nFirst, turn 55: move L to (3,1), no eat.\n\nSnake: head to (3,1), body: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)  -- tail (4,4)\n\nAfter move, positions: [(3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)]\n\nTurn 56: move L to (2,1), eat food at (2,1), so grow.\n\nNew head: (2,1)\n\nBody: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4) and new tail added at (4,4), so positions: [(2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)] tail at (4,4)\n\nNow turn 57: move L to (1,1), no food there, so no eat.\n\nNew head: (1,1)\n\nBody: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)  -- tail was (4,4), but since no eat, tail moves, so (4,4) gone, new tail is (5,4)\n\nPositions: head (1,1), then (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)  -- tail (5,4)\n\nTurn 58: move U to (1,2), no food, so move.\n\nNew head: (1,2)\n\nBody: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)  -- tail (5,4) gone, new tail (5,3)\n\nPositions: [(1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)] tail (5,3)\n\n(5,3) is tail.\n\nTurn 59: move U to (1,3), no food, so move.\n\nNew head: (1,3)\n\nBody: (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3)  -- tail (5,3) gone, new tail (4,3)\n\nPositions: [(1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3)] tail (4,3)\n\nTurn 60: move U to (1,4), no food? (1,4) has no food, food is at (1,5).\n\nNo eat.\n\nNew head: (1,4)\n\nBody: (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3)  -- tail (4,3) gone, new tail (3,3)\n\nPositions: [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3)] tail (3,3)\n\nTurn 61: move U to (1,5), eat food there.\n\nNew head: (1,5)\n\nBody: (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) and new segment at tail, so (3,3) stays, positions: [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3)] tail (3,3)\n\nGrown.\n\nIn this path, all moves are safe, no collision.\n\nWe ate two food: one at (2,1) on turn 56, one at (1,5) on turn 61.\n\nBut at turn 55, we didn't eat (1,3) because impossible.\n\n(6,3) not eaten.\n\nNow, is there a better way? For example, on turn 57, from (2,1), instead of moving L to (1,1), we could move U to (2,2), but that might lead to other areas.\n\nBut (1,5) is easier to reach, and we have time.\n\nMoreover, moving to (2,2) might have risks or dead ends later.\n\nFor example, from (2,2), we can go to (2,3), then to (2,4), etc, but to reach (1,5), we need to go left, which might be blocked.\n\nIn the current path, it's straightforward.\n\nPerhaps we can think about the tail or something.\n\nAnother thing: in the initial state, there was a food at (6,3), but we couldn't reach it in time.\n\nPerhaps at turn 55, we could have done something else, but at turn 55, we only had one choice: move L to (3,1), since U was death.\n\nSo no choice.\n\nTherefore, the sequence seems reasonable.\n\nNow, output the actions.\n\nStart from turn 55 to, say, turn 61, but the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", so probably output actions for several turns.\n\nSince t1=55, we can output up to turn 60 or 61.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be a sequence of actions.\n\nAlso, for each action, specify the direction.\n\nIn turn 55, move L.\n\nTurn 56, move L.\n\nTurn 57, move L to (1,1)\n\nBut direction: from (2,1) to (1,1) is left, so L.\n\nThen turn 58, from (1,1) to (1,2) is up, so U.\n\nTurn 59, from (1,2) to (1,3) is up, U.\n\nTurn 60, from (1,3) to (1,4) is up, U.\n\nTurn 61, from (1,4) to (1,5) is up, U.\n\nBut we need to output for multiple turns.\n\nThe problem says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nSo we can start from 55 to, say, 60 or more.\n\nSince thinking 5+ ahead, output 5 or 6 actions.\n\nt1=55, so turns 55 to 60 would be 6 actions.\n\nBut on turn 61 we eat food, but we can stop earlier.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 55: L\n\nTurn 56: L\n\nTurn 57: L\n\nTurn 58: U\n\nTurn 59: U\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nAnd then turn 61: U, but not included.\n\nWe can output up to turn 60.\n\nBut at turn 60, we are at (1,4), moving to (1,5) on next turn.\n\nBut the actions are for the turns.\n\nIn the answer, we list the actions for each turn.\n\nNow, another thing: in the initial move, on turn 55, we move L to (3,1), which is safe.\n\nIs there any risk in the future moves?\n\nFor example, when we are moving up the left column, the body is trailing, but since we are going straight, and no obstacles, it should be fine.\n\nWe could consider going to other areas, but with the body, it might be tight.\n\nFor instance, after eating at (2,1), we could go to (2,2) instead of (1,1), but then we might be able to access the center, but with the body, it could be risky.\n\nFor example, from (2,2), move to (2,3), then to (2,4), then to (2,5), then to (1,5), but (1,5) is at (1,5), so from (2,5) to (1,5) left.\n\nBut in this case, it might take more turns.\n\nFrom (2,1) to (2,2) on turn 57, then to (2,3) on turn 58, then to (2,4) on turn 59, then to (2,5) on turn 60, then to (1,5) on turn 61.\n\nSame as before, but instead of going left first, we go up then left.\n\nBut in the first path, we go left then up, which is similar.\n\nIn the first path, we go left to (1,1) then up to (1,2), (1,3), etc.\n\nIn the second, go up to (2,2), (2,3), etc.\n\nBut on (2,3), is it free? Yes.\n\nBut when we move to (2,2) on turn 57, from (2,1) to (2,2), direction U.\n\nThen positions: head (2,2), body (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), etc., tail (5,3) or something.\n\nEarlier after turn 56, positions include (2,1), (3,1), etc., (5,4), (4,4)? After turn 56: positions [(2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)]\n\nTail (4,4)\n\nTurn 57: move U to (2,2), no food, so move.\n\nNew head: (2,2)\n\nBody: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)  -- tail (4,4) gone, new tail (5,4)\n\nPositions: [(2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)] tail (5,4)\n\nThen turn 58: from (2,2), direction U, can move U, L, R? Cannot D.\n\nU to (2,3), L to (1,2), R to (3,2) but (3,2) occupied.\n\nSo U or L.\n\nIf move U to (2,3), no food.\n\nNew head (2,3)\n\nBody: (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)  -- tail (5,4) gone, new tail (5,3)\n\nPositions: [(2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)] tail (5,3)\n\nThen turn 59: move U to (2,4), etc.\n\nTo reach (1,5), we need to go to (1,5) eventually.\n\nBut from (2,3), we can move L to (1,3) on turn 59, then U to (1,4) turn 60, U to (1,5) turn 61.\n\nSimilar.\n\nBut in this case, we are filling the left side, but it might be ok.\n\nHowever, in the first path, by going left first, we are closer to (1,5) earlier, but we still eat at turn 61.\n\nNo difference.\n\nBut in the first path, when we go to (1,1), we are at the edge, which might be riskier if we need to escape, but here it seems fine.\n\nAnother point: the tail reward danger.\n\nIn this case, no issue.\n\nSo I think the initial plan is fine.\n\nTherefore, for the output:\n\nTurn 55: L\n\nTurn 56: L\n\nTurn 57: L\n\nTurn 58: U\n\nTurn 59: U\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nAnd so on, but since 5+ turns, we can do up to turn 60, which is 6 actions.\n\nt1=55, so turns 55 to 60.\n\nTo be precise, let's write the answer.\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 56 we eat food at (2,1), on turn 61 at (1,5).\n\nBut in the actions listed, we don't specify eating, just movement.\n\nNow, for the boxed answer.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 55: L (left)\n\nTurn 56: L (left)\n\nTurn 57: L (left)\n\nTurn 58: U (up)\n\nTurn 59: U (up)\n\nTurn 60: U (up)\n\nWe can add turn 61: U, but not necessary.\n\nSince thinking ahead, this should be fine.\n\nPerhaps we can consider after eating (1,5), but not needed for now.\n\nSo I think this is the plan.\n</think>\nBased on the current state at turn 55, the snake must prioritize survival and maximize score by eating available positive food while avoiding collisions and dead ends. After analyzing the grid, snake positions, food locations, and life spans, the following sequence of actions is determined by thinking 5+ turns ahead. Key considerations:\n\n- **Turn 55 Constraints**: Snake head is at (4,1) with direction L (left). Only safe move is L to (3,1) because:\n  - U to (4,2) causes collision with body segment.\n  - D to (4,0) is a wall.\n  - R to (5,1) is instant reverse (not allowed) and occupied.\n- **Food Priorities**: \n  - (1,3) must be eaten on turn 55 but is unreachable; it disappears after this turn.\n  - (2,1) is eaten on turn 56 for +1 score and growth.\n  - (6,3) has limited life span but is unreachable by turn 58 due to distance and body obstacles; it is skipped to avoid risk.\n  - (1,5) is targeted for turn 61 with ample life span remaining.\n- **Path Safety**: The sequence avoids body collisions and walls, leveraging the tail movement rule. Moving left then up the left column is efficient and low-risk for reaching (1,5).\n- **5+ Turn Plan**: Actions are planned through turn 60 to ensure the snake survives and positions for (1,5) consumption on turn 61.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe actions for turns 55 to 60 are as follows, ensuring the snake eats (2,1) on turn 56 and sets up for (1,5) on turn 61:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 55: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 56: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 57: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 58: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 59: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 60: U (up)\n}\n\n### Detailed Reasoning\n- **Turn 55 (Move L)**: Only safe move is left to (3,1). Food at (1,3) expires unused. Snake moves to [(3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)], tail at (4,4).\n- **Turn 56 (Move L)**: Head at (3,1), direction L. Move left to (2,1) to eat food (+1 score). Snake grows to 14 segments: [(2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)], tail at (4,4).\n- **Turn 57 (Move L)**: Head at (2,1), direction L. Move left to (1,1) (safe and progresses toward (1,5)). U to (2,2) is possible but delays (1,5) path. Snake moves to [(1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)], tail at (5,4).\n- **Turn 58 (Move U)**: Head at (1,1), direction L. Only safe move is up to (1,2) (D and L are walls; R is reverse not allowed). Snake moves to [(1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)], tail at (5,3).\n- **Turn 59 (Move U)**: Head at (1,2), direction U. Move up to (1,3) (safe; R to (2,2) is optional but U is direct to (1,5)). Snake moves to [(1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3)], tail at (4,3).\n- **Turn 60 (Move U)**: Head at (1,3), direction U. Move up to (1,4) (safe; continues to (1,5)). Snake moves to [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3)], tail at (3,3).\n\n**Next Step (Beyond Turn 60)**: On turn 61, move U to (1,5) to eat the food (+1 score and growth). This is achievable with life span remaining (at turn 61, life span for (1,5) is 4, decreasing to 3 after consumption).\n\nThis plan maximizes score by eating two food items ( (2,1) and (1,5) ) while ensuring long-term survival through safe, collision-free moves. The snake avoids the unreachable (6,3) and minimizes risk by staying near the left edge where body obstacles are fewer.",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 56. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (4,6). So the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n\nSnake positions: head at (3,1), then body segments: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4). Let me list them in order:\n\n- Head: (3,1)\n\n- Segment 1: (4,1)\n\n- Segment 2: (5,1)\n\n- Segment 3: (6,1)\n\n- Segment 4: (6,2)\n\n- Segment 5: (5,2)\n\n- Segment 6: (4,2)\n\n- Segment 7: (3,2)\n\n- Segment 8: (3,3)\n\n- Segment 9: (4,3)\n\n- Segment 10: (5,3)\n\n- Segment 11: (5,4)\n\n- Segment 12: (4,4)\n\nThat's 13 segments? Count: positions given: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4). That's 13 positions, so snake length is 13.\n\nHead direction is L, which is left, so moving towards decreasing x.\n\nFood:\n\n- (6,3) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (2,1) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (1,5) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive; no negative food here.\n\nI need to plan moves for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns. But the answer format says to output actions for turns starting from t1, but it doesn't specify how many turns. Probably I need to provide a sequence for the immediate future, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan a sequence and output it.\n\nThe answer format is: boxed with Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, etc. But it doesn't say how many actions to list. I think I should list actions for as long as I can plan or until a decision point, but since the state might change, I need to focus on the next few moves.\n\nAlso, food life spans are given: (6,3) has life 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn? Let me read the rule.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for food at (6,3), life span 4 at turn 56. So on turn 56, life span decreases to 3? Or at the end of turn?\n\nThe rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nI think it means that at the start of turn t, if life span is L, after the turn, it becomes L-1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or something.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nTypically, if countdown decreases every turn including current, then on the turn it's spawned, life span N, after that turn, it becomes N-1, and so on, until 0, then it disappears.\n\nBut here, it says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo for food at (6,3) with life span 4 at turn 56. That means:\n\n- At turn 56: life span 4\n\n- After turn 56: life span 3\n\n- After turn 57: life span 2\n\n- After turn 58: life span 1\n\n- After turn 59: life span 0 → disappears, so not available on turn 60.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) life span 6: will disappear after turn 61? Let's calculate.\n\nTurn 56: life span 6\n\nAfter turn 56: 5\n\nAfter turn 57: 4\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 61: 0, disappear before turn 62.\n\n(1,5) life span 9: disappear after turn 64, before turn 65.\n\nNow, snake head at (3,1), direction left.\n\nPossible moves: since head direction is L, I can move U, D, L, but not R because of no instant reverse? Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nCurrent direction is L, so opposite is R. So cannot move R next. Can move U, D, or L.\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n- Up: (3,2) but that's a body segment? Snake positions: (3,1) head, then (4,1), (5,1), etc. (3,2) is also a body segment? Positions: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), etc. So (3,2) is segment 7 or 8? Index: position 0: (3,1), 1: (4,1), 2: (5,1), 3: (6,1), 4: (6,2), 5: (5,2), 6: (4,2), 7: (3,2), 8: (3,3), etc.\n\nSo (3,2) is occupied by body, so moving up to (3,2) would cause collision, death.\n\nSimilarly, left: from (3,1), left is (2,1). Is that a wall? Walls: border x=0 or x=7, y=0 or y=7. x=0 is wall, so (2,1) is not wall, since x=2, y=1, between 0 and 7.\n\nx from 0 to 7, so (2,1) is within bounds. Walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal (4,6).\n\nSo (2,1) is not wall.\n\nBut (2,1) has food! Food at (2,1) with value 1, life span 6.\n\nDown: from (3,1), down is (3,0). But y=0 is wall, so (3,0) is wall, cannot move there.\n\nLeft: to (2,1), which has food and is not wall.\n\nBut is it safe? Moving to (2,1): since it's food, if I eat it, snake grows, so new head at (2,1), and tail doesn't move? When you eat food, the snake grows, so after moving to food, the tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n\nRule: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food.\n\nSo if head moves to food cell, it eats it, and the segment is added, but tail stays, so positions increase.\n\nNow, collision: moving to (2,1). Is (2,1) occupied by body? Snake positions: all positions listed, (2,1) is not in the list, so it's free, except for the food.\n\nFood is on the cell, but when head moves there, it eats it.\n\nBut Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (4,4). Head at (3,1), tail at (4,4), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (3,1) and (4,4) are not adjacent; distance is |dx| + |dy| = |3-4| + |1-4| =1+3=4, not adjacent.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nMoving to (2,1) seems possible and I eat the food.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nAlso, other options: I could move up, but up to (3,2) is body, collision. Down to (3,0) is wall, collision. Left to (2,1) is food. Or I can move in direction L, which is left, to (2,1).\n\nCurrent direction is L, so moving L is straight.\n\nBut I have other moves? U and D are not possible due to collision/wall, so only possible move is left to (2,1).\n\nIs that right?\n\nLet's confirm adjacent cells:\n\n- Up: (3,1) to (3,2): y+1, but (3,2) is occupied by body segment at index 7, (3,2). So yes, body, collision.\n\n- Down: (3,1) to (3,0): y-1, but y=0 is wall, so collision.\n\n- Left: (3,1) to (2,1): x-1, y same. (2,1) is not wall, and has food, but not occupied by body.\n\n- Right: (3,1) to (4,1): but (4,1) is body segment index 1, and also, moving right is opposite to current direction L, so no instant reverse, cannot move right.\n\nSo indeed, only possible move is left to (2,1).\n\nSo for turn 56, I must move left to (2,1), eat the food there.\n\nFood at (2,1) has value 1, life span 6, so I eat it, snake grows to length 14.\n\nAfter eating, new head at (2,1), and the tail stays, so body segments: now head at (2,1), then previous head (3,1) becomes body, so positions: [(2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)]\n\nLength 14.\n\nNow, head direction: I moved left, so new direction is L.\n\nNow, next turn, turn 57.\n\nI need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, food: (2,1) is eaten, so removed. Other food: (6,3) life span now? At turn 56, life span was 4, after turn 56, it decreases to 3.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) life span 9, decreases to 8? But not eaten yet.\n\nTurn 57: head at (2,1), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, not R (opposite).\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n- Up: (2,1) to (2,2). Is (2,2) free? Snake positions: after move, positions are [(2,1), (3,1), (4,1), ... (4,4)]. (2,2) is not in list, so free? But is there food or wall?\n\nWalls: x=0,7 y=0,7, internal (4,6). (2,2) not wall.\n\nFood: food at (6,3) and (1,5), not at (2,2). So (2,2) is empty.\n\n- Down: (2,1) to (2,0). y=0 wall, collision.\n\n- Left: (2,1) to (1,1). x=1, not wall, not body? Positions: (1,1) not in snake, so free, no food.\n\n- Right: (2,1) to (3,1), but (3,1) is body segment, and also opposite direction, cannot move.\n\nSo possible moves: Up to (2,2), Left to (1,1).\n\nNow, I need to choose.\n\nAlso, food available: (6,3) at (6,3) with life span 3 now (after turn 56), so must be eaten by turn 59 or it disappears.\n\n(1,5) at (1,5) with life span 8 after turn 56.\n\n(6,3) is at (6,3), which is near the current position? Head at (2,1), (6,3) is far.\n\n(1,5) is at (1,5), which is closer.\n\n(1,5) is at x=1,y=5.\n\nFrom (2,1), to (1,5) is not adjacent; need to move.\n\nSince I have two choices: up or left.\n\nIf I move left to (1,1), that gets me closer to (1,5), but (1,5) is up.\n\n(1,1) to (1,5) is straight up, but there might be obstacles.\n\nIf I move up to (2,2), that might be towards the center or something.\n\nBut let's think about the grid.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all border cells, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, meaning we cannot enter them. Also internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions after turn 56: head (2,1), body: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)\n\nNow, food: (6,3) and (1,5)\n\n(6,3) is at (6,3), which is currently occupied? Snake has (6,1), (6,2), but not (6,3). (6,3) is free, with food.\n\nBut (6,3) is adjacent to (6,2), which is body, but food can be under body? No, food positions are given, and (6,3) is listed, so it's not under snake body, I think.\n\nSnake positions: at (6,1) and (6,2), but not (6,3), so (6,3) is free cell with food.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) is free.\n\nNow, (6,3) life span: after turn 56, life span 3, so must be eaten by turn 59.\n\nTurn 56: ate (2,1)\n\nTurn 57: if not eaten, life span decreases.\n\nAfter turn 56, food (6,3) life span was 4 at start of turn 56, after turn 56, it becomes 3.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow turn 57, head at (2,1), direction L (since last move left).\n\nOptions: U to (2,2) or L to (1,1)\n\nIf I move L to (1,1), then head at (1,1), direction L.\n\nThen from (1,1), possible moves: U to (1,2), D to (1,0) but y=0 wall, R to (2,1) but (2,1) is now body? After moving to (1,1), positions: head (1,1), then (2,1), (3,1), etc. So (2,1) is body, and moving right to (2,1) is collision, and also opposite if direction was L, but after moving left to (1,1), new direction L, so moving right to (2,1) is opposite, not allowed anyway.\n\nFrom (1,1), with direction L:\n\n- U: (1,2) - free?\n\n- D: (1,0) wall, invalid\n\n- L: (0,1) but x=0 wall, invalid\n\n- R: (2,1) body and opposite, invalid\n\nSo only possible move is U to (1,2)\n\nThen from (1,2), I can go to (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) to eat the food at (1,5).\n\n(1,5) has life span 8 after turn 56, so plenty of time.\n\nIf from turn 57 I move U to (2,2), then head at (2,2), direction U (since I moved up).\n\nThen from (2,2), possible moves: U to (2,3), D to (2,1) but (2,1) is body, L to (1,2), R to (3,2) but (3,2) is body.\n\nSnake positions after turn 56: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)\n\nSo at (2,2), it's free? Not occupied.\n\n(2,2) not in list, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) not in list, free.\n\n(1,2) free.\n\n(3,2) is occupied by body.\n\nSo from (2,2) with direction U:\n\n- U to (2,3) - free\n\n- D to (2,1) - body, collision\n\n- L to (1,2) - free\n\n- R to (3,2) - body, collision\n\nSo possible: U to (2,3) or L to (1,2)\n\nIf I go to (1,2), I can then go to (1,3), etc. to (1,5).\n\nBut (6,3) is also there with short life span.\n\n(6,3) at (6,3), head at (2,1) or after moves.\n\nDistance: from (2,1) to (6,3) is |dx|=4, |dy|=2, so min 6 moves, but with obstacles.\n\nBut life span 3, meaning after turn 56, life span 3, so at turn 57, if not eaten, life span 2; turn 58, life span 1; turn 59, life span 0, disappear before turn 60.\n\nSo must be eaten on or before turn 59.\n\nTurn 57,58,59 to eat it.\n\nNow, from current position (2,1) on turn 57, to (6,3), it's at least 6 moves away, since |dx|=4, |dy|=2, so Manhattan distance 6, but snake body in the way.\n\nPossible path? From (2,1) to (6,3).\n\nBut grid has walls and snake body.\n\nFor example, from (2,1), if I go up to (2,2), then to (2,3), but (2,3) free, then to (2,4), etc, but y=3 to y=3, x from 2 to 6.\n\nBut at x=3, y=2 to y=4, there is snake body.\n\nSnake has segments at (3,2), (3,3), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), etc.\n\n(3,2) is occupied, (3,3) occupied, (4,2) occupied, (4,3) occupied, (5,3) occupied.\n\nSo row y=3 has snake from x=3 to x=5, and (6,3) is at x=6,y=3.\n\n(6,3) is free, but to reach it, I need to go to (5,3) or (6,2) or (6,4), but (6,2) is snake body, (5,3) is snake body.\n\n(6,2) is segment index 4, (5,3) is segment 10.\n\nSo (6,3) is adjacent to (6,2) and (5,3), both body, but since snake moves, when I move, the tail moves, so cells might free up.\n\nBut to eat (6,3), I need the head to move onto it when it's free.\n\nCurrently, (6,3) is free with food.\n\nBut if I move towards it, by the time I reach, it might be gone or body moved.\n\nBut life span short.\n\nFrom (2,1), to reach (6,3) in 3 moves is impossible, since min distance 6.\n\nTurn 57,58,59: three moves to eat on turn 59.\n\nBut from (2,1) to (6,3) in three moves? |dx|=4, |dy|=2, min moves 6, impossible in 3 moves.\n\nEven with Manhattan distance, min steps is 6.\n\nSo I cannot reach (6,3) by turn 59; it will disappear.\n\nTurn 57,58,59: on turn 59, I can eat it.\n\nBut to be on (6,3) on turn 59, I need to start moving now.\n\nBut from (2,1) at turn 57, after move on turn 57, I am at new position, say (2,2) or (1,1).\n\nThen turn 58, another move, turn 59, another move.\n\nIn three moves, max I can cover |dx|+|dy| <=3, but (6,3) - (2,1) = (4,2), sum 6>3, so impossible to reach in 3 moves from (2,1).\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to eat (6,3) before it disappears. It will be gone after turn 59.\n\nSo I should ignore (6,3) and focus on other food.\n\nNow, only other food is (1,5), at (1,5), life span 8 after turn 56, so after turn 57:7, turn 58:6, etc, disappear after turn 64.\n\nPlenty of time.\n\nNow, from current position (2,1) on turn 57, I can go to (1,1) or (2,2).\n\nIf I go to (1,1), then as before, only move is up to (1,2), then to (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) to eat.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nIf I go to (2,2), then I can go to (2,3) or (1,2).\n\n(1,2) is also on the way to (1,5).\n\n(1,5) is at (1,5), so moving along x=1 is direct.\n\nBut from (2,2), if I go to (1,2), same as above.\n\nOr I can go to (2,3), then to (2,4), but (1,5) is at y=5, so I need to go left at some point.\n\nBut there might be risks.\n\nFirst, let's see the snake body.\n\nAfter eating at (2,1), snake is long, and body occupies many cells.\n\nPositions: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)\n\nNow, the tail is at (4,4), which will move when I don't eat food.\n\nBut when I move, if I don't eat, tail moves, so cells free up.\n\nFor example, if I move to (1,1) on turn 57, then positions: head (1,1), then (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4) — tail (4,4) is removed? When I move to (1,1), since no food eaten, tail moves.\n\nOn turn 57, I move to (1,1), which is not food, so snake moves: head to (1,1), and tail from (4,4) is removed, so new positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)] — (5,4) was tail, removed, and (4,4) is gone, but (4,4) was position, after move, tail is removed.\n\nOriginal positions: indices 0:head (2,1), 1:(3,1), 2:(4,1), 3:(5,1), 4:(6,1), 5:(6,2), 6:(5,2), 7:(4,2), 8:(3,2), 9:(3,3), 10:(4,3), 11:(5,3), 12:(5,4), 13:(4,4) — tail is (4,4)\n\nWhen I move head to new position without eating, tail is removed.\n\nSo if move to (1,1), not food, so new head at (1,1), and segments: (2,1) to (4,4) but without the last one? The body segments shift.\n\nNew positions: head at new position, then the previous head to second last, and tail removed.\n\nSo previous positions except the tail is removed, and new head added.\n\nSo from [(2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)] , move head to (1,1), not eat, so new positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)] — tail was (4,4), removed, and (5,4) was second last, now last? Positions: index 0: (2,1) head, 1:(3,1), 2:(4,1), ..., up to 13:(4,4) tail.\n\nAfter move to (1,1) not eat: new head at (1,1), then segment 0 becomes body: so (1,1) head, then (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), and (5,4) is the last body? Segment 12 is (5,4), which was part of body, now becomes tail? Let's list indices.\n\nBefore move: positions: p0=(2,1) head, p1=(3,1), p2=(4,1), p3=(5,1), p4=(6,1), p5=(6,2), p6=(5,2), p7=(4,2), p8=(3,2), p9=(3,3), p10=(4,3), p11=(5,3), p12=(5,4), p13=(4,4) tail.\n\nAfter moving head to new position (1,1) without eating: the new head is (1,1), and the body is p0 to p12, but p13 is removed. So positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)] — p12=(5,4) is not included? p12 is (5,4), which was before tail.\n\nThe segments from index 0 to 12: p0 to p12, but p0 was head, now becomes first body segment.\n\nAfter move: new head at new position, then the previous positions from index 0 to len-2 become the body, but since not eating, length same, so the last position is removed.\n\nStandard: when not eating, head moves to new cell, tail moves out of the last cell.\n\nSo new positions: [new_head] + positions[:-1]\n\nSo previous positions: list of cells, head at index 0.\n\nAfter moving to new cell not food: new_head = new_cell, new_body = previous_positions[:-1]  # all except the last one\n\nSo new positions: [new_cell] + previous_positions[0:-1]\n\nIn this case, previous positions: [p0, p1, p2, ..., p13] with p0 head, p13 tail.\n\nAfter move to new_cell not food: new positions = [new_cell] + [p0, p1, p2, ..., p12]  # p0 to p12, which are the first 13 segments except the tail p13.\n\np0 to p12 is 13 positions, plus new head, 14 positions? No.\n\nList has 14 positions: indices 0 to 13.\n\np0 to p13.\n\nAfter move not eat: new head at new_cell, then p0 to p12 as body.\n\nBut p0 to p12 is 13 positions, plus new head, 14 positions, but since not eating, length should be same, 14? Before move, length 14, after not eating, length 14.\n\nBefore turn 57, after turn 56, snake length 14.\n\nAfter move on turn 57 not eating, length still 14, but tail moved.\n\nPositions: new head at (1,1), then previous head p0=(2,1) becomes first body, then p1=(3,1), ..., up to p12=(5,4), and p13=(4,4) is removed.\n\np12 is (5,4), which was index 12.\n\nPrevious positions: index 0: (2,1), 1:(3,1), 2:(4,1), 3:(5,1), 4:(6,1), 5:(6,2), 6:(5,2), 7:(4,2), 8:(3,2), 9:(3,3), 10:(4,3), 11:(5,3), 12:(5,4), 13:(4,4)\n\nAfter moving head to (1,1) not eating: new positions: head (1,1), then body: previous index 0 to 12: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)\n\nIndex 13 (4,4) is removed.\n\nSo new tail is (5,4).\n\nSimilarly, if I move to (2,2) not eating, similar.\n\nBut back to choice.\n\nFor (6,3), I cannot reach it in time, so ignore.\n\nNow for (1,5), I can eat it.\n\nFrom (2,1) on turn 57, if I move left to (1,1), then on turn 57, I move to (1,1), not food, so no grow, positions as above, head at (1,1), direction L.\n\nThen on turn 58, from (1,1), I can only move up to (1,2), since other moves invalid.\n\nMove to (1,2), not food (assume), so head to (1,2), body: [ (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), ..., (5,4) but with tail moved, etc.\n\nThen turn 59, to (1,3), not food.\n\nTurn 60, to (1,4), not food.\n\nTurn 61, to (1,5), eat food, grow to length 15.\n\nLife span of (1,5): after turn 56, life span 9, so after turn 56:8, turn 57:7, turn 58:6, turn 59:5, turn 60:4, turn 61:3, so on turn 61 I eat it, life span 3, fine.\n\nIf from turn 57 I move up to (2,2), then head at (2,2), direction U.\n\nThen on turn 58, from (2,2), I can move U to (2,3) or L to (1,2).\n\nIf I move L to (1,2), then similar to above, then to (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) by turn 61.\n\nIf I move U to (2,3), then head at (2,3), direction U.\n\nThen from (2,3), possible moves: U to (2,4), D to (2,2) but (2,2) is now body? After moving to (2,2) on turn 57, positions: if moved to (2,2) not eat, then new positions: head (2,2), then (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) — tail (5,4) removed? Previous positions after turn 56: [ (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4) ]\n\nAfter move to (2,2) not eat: new head (2,2), then body: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4) — (4,4) removed, tail (5,4).\n\n(5,4) is tail.\n\nNow from (2,3) on turn 58? Turn 57: moved to (2,2)\n\nThen turn 58, from (2,2) with direction U, move to (2,3) or (1,2).\n\nIf move to (2,3), not food, then head to (2,3), body: (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) — tail (5,4) removed? After move to (2,3), new head (2,3), body: previous body except last, so [ (2,3) ] + [ (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), ..., (5,3) ] but previous body was [ (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) ] since tail (5,4) was removed when moving to (2,2).\n\nAfter turn 57 move to (2,2): positions: head (2,2), body (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) — and (5,4) was removed, so tail is (5,3)? Positions: [ (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) ] length 13? No.\n\nPrevious length 14, after not eating, length 13? Mistake.\n\nTurn 56: after eating, length 14.\n\nTurn 57: move to new cell not eating, so length should be 14, but tail moves, so one cell freed.\n\nIn positions, number of segments same.\n\nAfter turn 56: positions list has 14 cells.\n\nAfter move turn 57 to (1,1) not eating: new head (1,1), then the first 13 of previous: previous positions [0] to [12], which are (2,1) to (5,4), but index 12 is (5,4), index 13 is (4,4).\n\nSo new positions: [ (1,1) ] + [ (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4) ] — so (4,4) removed, and (5,4) is now the last body segment.\n\nSimilarly for moving to (2,2).\n\nSo length 14.\n\nThen turn 58 from (2,2) move to (2,3): new head (2,3), body [ (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) ] — and (5,4) removed, tail (5,3).\n\nBut (5,3) is now tail.\n\nThen I can continue to (2,4), etc.\n\nBut to reach (1,5), from (2,3) I can go left to (1,3) or up to (2,4).\n\nBut (1,3) might be free.\n\nThen to (1,4), (1,5).\n\nBut moving directly left from (2,1) to (1,1) then up is shorter to (1,5).\n\nFrom (2,1) to (1,5): |dx|=1, |dy|=4, so min 5 moves.\n\nIf I move left to (1,1) on turn 57, then up to (1,2) turn 58, (1,3) turn 59, (1,4) turn 60, (1,5) turn 61.\n\nEat on turn 61.\n\nIf I move up to (2,2) on turn 57, then to (1,2) on turn 58, then to (1,3) turn 59, (1,4) turn 60, (1,5) turn 61, same.\n\nOr from (2,2) to (2,3) turn 58, then to (1,3) turn 59? From (2,3) to (1,3) is left, then to (1,4) turn 60, (1,5) turn 61.\n\nStill turn 61.\n\nBut if I go to (2,3), I might have more space, but it takes the same time to reach (1,5).\n\nSince both paths take 4 moves to eat from turn 57, on turn 61.\n\nTurn 57: move to (1,1) or (2,2)\n\nTurn 58: to (1,2) in both cases if I choose\n\nThen turn 59: to (1,3)\n\nTurn 60: to (1,4)\n\nTurn 61: to (1,5) eat\n\nNow, I need to consider if there are any dangers.\n\nFor example, when moving up from (1,4) to (1,5), is there Tail Reward Danger?\n\nTail is somewhere, but not adjacent, so no.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (4,6), but not in the way.\n\nNow, but on the path, when I move to (1,1), then to (1,2), etc, are there any body cells blocking?\n\nFor example, after turn 57, if I move to (1,1), positions: head (1,1), body (2,1), (3,1), ..., up to (5,3), (5,4)? Earlier.\n\nAfter turn 57 move to (1,1) not eat: positions: head (1,1), then (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) — and (5,4) is included? From earlier: [ (1,1) ] + [ (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) ] but that's 13 positions, missing one.\n\nPrevious positions after turn 56: 14 positions.\n\nWhen adding new head and removing tail, it should be 14 positions.\n\n[ new_head ] + previous_positions[0:13] but previous_positions[0] to [12] is 13 positions? Indices 0 to 12 is 13 items.\n\nList: positions from index 0 to 13, 14 items.\n\nAfter move not eat: new positions = [new_cell] + positions[0:-1]  # positions[0:-1] is indices 0 to 12, which is 13 items.\n\n[new_cell] + positions[0:-1] : new_cell and positions[0] to positions[12], which is 14 items? positions[0:-1] is positions[0] to positions[12], since -1 is last, so 0 to 12 inclusive is 13 items.\n\nIn Python, list[0:-1] is from index 0 to second last.\n\nFor list of 14 elements, indices 0 to 13, list[0:-1] is indices 0 to 12, 13 elements.\n\nThen [new_cell] + that is 14 elements.\n\nSimilarly here.\n\nAfter turn 56: positions: let's list: p0=(2,1), p1=(3,1), p2=(4,1), p3=(5,1), p4=(6,1), p5=(6,2), p6=(5,2), p7=(4,2), p8=(3,2), p9=(3,3), p10=(4,3), p11=(5,3), p12=(5,4), p13=(4,4)\n\nAfter move to (1,1) not eat: new positions = [ (1,1) ] + [p0, p1, p2, ..., p12] = [ (1,1) , (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4) ]\n\np12 is (5,4), so positions: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)\n\nTail at (5,4).\n\nNow on turn 58, move to (1,2): from (1,1) to (1,2), not food, so new head (1,2), body: [ (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) ] — tail (5,4) removed.\n\nAnd so on.\n\n(1,2) is free, no issue.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3), (1,4) should be free.\n\n(1,5) has food.\n\nSo path is safe.\n\nIf I go via (2,2), same thing.\n\nBut moving directly to (1,1) might be better because it gets me closer to the food faster in terms of x-direction.\n\nIn terms of moves, both ways take the same number of moves to reach (1,5).\n\nBut since I need to output actions, and for turn 57, I have to choose one.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there are other opportunities or risks.\n\nThe food at (1,5) is the only one left, and I need to eat it to score.\n\nBut after eating it, I need to survive.\n\nBut for now, eating it is good.\n\nAlso, the grid might have limited space, but I can move around after.\n\nBut let's see the current grid occupation.\n\nx from 0 to 7, y 0 to 7, walls at borders and (4,6).\n\nSnake body occupies: from (1,1) to (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), etc.\n\nThe area around (1,1) to (1,5) is mostly free except near the body.\n\nFor example, (1,3) to (1,5) should be free.\n\n(1,4), (1,5) free.\n\nAfter I move to (1,5) and eat, I grow, then I need to find space to move.\n\nBut that's later.\n\nFor turn 57, moving left to (1,1) seems fine.\n\nBut let's confirm the direction.\n\nOn turn 57, head at (2,1), direction L.\n\nMoving left to (1,1) is continuing left, so direction L.\n\nThen turn 58, head at (1,1), direction L, then only move up to (1,2), direction U.\n\nIf I move up to (2,2) on turn 57, from (2,1) to (2,2), direction U.\n\nThen turn 58, from (2,2) direction U, I can move U to (2,3) or L to (1,2).\n\nIf I move L to (1,2), direction L.\n\nThen to (1,3), etc.\n\nNo big difference.\n\nBut to be consistent, since I started moving left, I can continue.\n\nNow for the answer, I need to output actions from turn 56.\n\nTurn 56: must move left to (2,1), as we decided.\n\nThen turn 57: I can move left to (1,1) or up to (2,2).\n\nI think moving left to (1,1) is better to directly go to the food.\n\nThen turn 58: from (1,1) move up to (1,2)\n\nTurn 59: to (1,3)\n\nTurn 60: to (1,4)\n\nTurn 61: to (1,5) eat.\n\nBut I need to output actions for turns, but the food life is long, so I can do that.\n\nBut perhaps I should output a sequence.\n\nSince the state might change, but for now, this seems the plan.\n\nBut on turn 57, if I move to (1,1), then I'm forced to move up, which is fine.\n\nIf I move to (2,2), I have choice, but I might go to (2,3) which delays the food.\n\nSo better to go directly.\n\nAlso, Tail Reward Danger: when I eat at (1,5), where is the tail? But not adjacent, so no issue.\n\nFor example, on turn 61, head at (1,4), move to (1,5) eat.\n\nAt that time, tail might be somewhere, but since I grow, the new tail is where the old tail was, and head moves to food, so as long as not adjacent to tail when eating, fine.\n\nIn this case, tail is far, so ok.\n\nNow, back to turn 56.\n\nFirst, for turn 56, action: L (left)\n\nThen for turn 57, action: L (left to (1,1))\n\nThen turn 58: from (1,1), must move U (up to (1,2))\n\nThen turn 59: from (1,2), direction U (since moved up), then move U to (1,3)\n\nSimilarly, turn 60: U to (1,4)\n\nTurn 61: U to (1,5) eat.\n\nBut I need to output actions starting from turn 56, and for how many turns?\n\nThe answer format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but not specified how many. I think for the immediate decisions.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide a sequence of 5 actions or so.\n\nt1=56, so turns 56 to 60 or 61.\n\nBut on turn 61 I eat, so up to turn 61.\n\nBut let's list.\n\nAlso, I forgot the internal obstacle, but it's at (4,6), not in the way.\n\nAnother thing: when I move to (1,1), etc, are there walls? x=1, y=1, not border, so fine.\n\ny=0 and y=7 walls, but y=1 to 5 fine.\n\nx=0 wall, but (1,1) is x=1, not 0.\n\nSo all good.\n\nNow for the sequence.\n\nBut in the food, (6,3) is there, but I cannot eat it, so ignore.\n\n(1,5) is the target.\n\nSo for turn 56: move L\n\nThen turn 57: move L to (1,1)\n\nBut on turn 57, after moving to (1,1), direction is L.\n\nThen turn 58: from (1,1), only possible move is U, to (1,2)\n\nThen turn 59: from (1,2), direction U, move U to (1,3)\n\nTurn 60: U to (1,4)\n\nTurn 61: U to (1,5) eat.\n\nBut I need to output for turn 56 and onwards.\n\nSince turn 57 I have a choice, but in this case, moving L is better.\n\nIf I move U on turn 57, I can still go to (1,2) later, but it might take same time or more if I detour.\n\nFor example, if turn 57 move U to (2,2), then turn 58 move L to (1,2), then same as above from turn 59.\n\nBut turn 57 move U, then turn 58 move L to (1,2), then turn 59 to (1,3), etc, so I reach (1,5) on turn 61 same, but I moved to (2,2) which might be less efficient if there are risks, but here no.\n\nBut since moving L directly is shorter path, I think it's fine.\n\nTo maximize score, eating faster is better? But score is per food, and no time penalty, so as long as I eat before it disappears, same score.\n\nBut survival is key.\n\nIn this path, moving along x=1 is safe.\n\nIf I go to (2,2), I might have more options, but not necessary.\n\nI think moving left on turn 57 is reasonable.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nAlso, the snake head direction changes.\n\nBut in actions, I just output the move.\n\nNow, output format.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 56: L\nTurn 57: L\nTurn 58: U\nTurn 59: U\nTurn 60: U\nTurn 61: U\n}\n\nBut turn 61 is t1+5, t1=56, t1+5=61.\n\nt1=56, t1+1=57, ..., up to t1+5=61.\n\nBut on turn 61 I move U to (1,5) eat.\n\nBut I need to think if all these moves are possible without collision.\n\nFor example, on turn 58, move to (1,2): is it free? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) all free.\n\nAnd no walls.\n\nSo should be fine.\n\nPerhaps I should include one more to show I eat.\n\nBut the actions are the moves.\n\nSince after turn 61 I eat, but I don't need to output beyond.\n\nBut in the sequence, turn 60: at (1,4), move U to (1,5).\n\nAll good.\n\nIn the initial, turn 56 must be L, no choice.\n\nFor turn 57, I chose L.\n\nBut is there a reason to choose U? For example, if I go to (2,2), I might avoid potential issues, but here no.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (4,6), but not relevant.\n\nAlso, the snake body, when I move, the tail moves, so cells free up, but in this path, I don't go near the body, so no issue.\n\nFor example, moving to (1,2) on turn 58, the body is at (2,1) etc, not blocking.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nTherefore, the sequence:\n\nTurn 56: L\n\nTurn 57: L\n\nTurn 58: U\n\nTurn 59: U\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: U\n\nBut turn 61 is not necessary, but since I think ahead, I can include.\n\nThe answer format says \"action on turn t1, t1+1, ...\" so I should list a few.\n\nPerhaps 5 turns: turn 56 to 60.\n\nBut on turn 60 I am at (1,4), moving to (1,5) on turn 61.\n\nBut for the plan, it's fine.\n\nI think listing to turn 61 is ok.\n\nTo be precise.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan for Snake Game\n\n**Current State (Turn 56):**\n- **Snake Head**: (3,1), direction Left (L).\n- **Snake Body**: The snake has 13 segments, occupying cells: [(3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)].\n- **Food**:\n  - (6,3): Value +1, life span 4 (must be eaten by turn 59; disappears after turn 59).\n  - (2,1): Value +1, life span 6 (must be eaten by turn 61; disappears after turn 61).\n  - (1,5): Value +1, life span 9 (must be eaten by turn 64; disappears after turn 64).\n- **Walls**: Border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacle at (4,6).\n- **Constraints**: Current direction is L, so instant reverse (R) is not allowed on turn 57.\n\n**Key Observations and Risks:**\n- **Turn 56 Move**: From (3,1), the only safe and legal move is Left (L) to (2,1), as:\n  - Up (U) to (3,2) causes body collision (occupied by segment).\n  - Down (D) to (3,0) causes wall collision (y=0 wall).\n  - Right (R) is opposite direction (instant reverse forbidden).\n  - Moving to (2,1) eats positive food (value +1), increasing snake length to 14.\n- **Food Prioritization**:\n  - (6,3) cannot be reached by turn 59: From (2,1) after turn 56, Manhattan distance to (6,3) is |4| in x + |2| in y = 6 cells, requiring at least 6 moves. Only 3 moves (turns 57-59) are available before it disappears, so it is ignored.\n  - (2,1) is eaten on turn 56.\n  - (1,5) is the only remaining food. It must be eaten by turn 64 but can be reached safely in 4 moves from (2,1) via a direct path along x=1.\n- **Path to (1,5)**:\n  - From (2,1) on turn 57, moving Left (L) to (1,1) is optimal to minimize distance.\n  - From (1,1), only move is Up (U) to (1,2) (other moves are invalid: down to wall, left to wall, right to body).\n  - Continue moving Up (U) to (1,3), (1,4), and (1,5) on subsequent turns.\n  - Eating (1,5) on turn 61 is within its life span (life span 9 at turn 56 → 8 after turn 56 → 7 after turn 57 → ... → 3 after turn 61; eaten on turn 61).\n- **Collision Risks**: \n  - The path (1,1) to (1,5) is clear of walls, obstacles, and body segments. Tail Reward Danger is not triggered; the tail is distant (e.g., at (5,3) or similar on turn 61).\n- **Long-Term Survival**: After eating (1,5), the snake can explore open areas (e.g., around y=4-6, x=1-3), avoiding the body cluster near (3,1)-(6,2). The internal wall at (4,6) is not a near-term concern.\n\n**5+ Turn Plan:**\n- **Turn 56**: Move L to (2,1) – eats (2,1), grows to length 14.\n- **Turn 57**: Move L to (1,1) – positions for direct path to (1,5), no food eaten.\n- **Turn 58**: Move U to (1,2) – only legal move from (1,1), no food.\n- **Turn 59**: Move U to (1,3) – no food, continue path.\n- **Turn 60**: Move U to (1,4) – no food, approach (1,5).\n- **Turn 61**: Move U to (1,5) – eats (1,5), grows to length 15.\n\nThis sequence maximizes score by eating all accessible food (2,1) and (1,5) while avoiding risks. (6,3) is unattainable. Survival is ensured by open paths and no near-term dead ends.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 56: L \\\\\nTurn 57: L \\\\\nTurn 58: U \\\\\nTurn 59: U \\\\\nTurn 60: U \\\\\nTurn 61: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 57. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (4,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n\nSnake positions: head at (2,1), and the body segments follow: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4). That's 14 segments. Let me list them in order:\n\n1. Head: (2,1)\n\n2. (3,1)\n\n3. (4,1)\n\n4. (5,1)\n\n5. (6,1)\n\n6. (6,2)\n\n7. (5,2)\n\n8. (4,2)\n\n9. (3,2)\n\n10. (3,3)\n\n11. (4,3)\n\n12. (5,3)\n\n13. (5,4)\n\n14. (4,4)  // that's the tail?\n\nSnake positions have 14 elements, so length is 14. Head direction is L, which is left, so moving towards decreasing x.\n\nFood: two items:\n\n- (6,3) with life span 3, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (1,5) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 57, food at (6,3) has life span 3, meaning it will disappear after 3 more turns? Let's see the rule: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, if life span is L, it will be there for L turns, including turn t, so it disappears at turn t + L.\n\nFor (6,3): at turn 57, life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 59? Let's clarify:\n\n- Turn 57: life span 3, present\n\n- Turn 58: life span 2, present\n\n- Turn 59: life span 1, present\n\n- Turn 60: life span 0, disappears? But the rule says \"disappears after N turns\", and countdown decreases each turn including current.\n\nPerhaps: at turn t, with life span L, it will be present from turn t to turn t + L - 1? I need to be careful.\n\nThe rule: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo, for example, at turn t, life span N, it means:\n\n- Turn t: countdown N, present\n\n- Turn t+1: countdown N-1, present if N-1 > 0\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn t + N-1: countdown 1, present\n\n- Turn t + N: countdown 0, disappears\n\nYes, that makes sense. So for (6,3) at turn 57, life span 3, so it will be present until turn 59 (since turn 57: countdown 3, turn 58: countdown 2, turn 59: countdown 1, turn 60: countdown 0, gone).\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) life span 8, so present until turn 57 + 7 = 64? Turn 57: L=8, present; turn 58: L=7; ... turn 64: L=1, present; turn 65: L=0, gone. So from turn 57 to 64 inclusive, 8 turns.\n\nTurn 57: L=8, turn 58: L=7, ..., turn 64: L=1, so present for 8 turns, from t=57 to t=64.\n\nNow, snake head at (2,1), direction L, so it was moving left. Possible moves: since direction is L, I can move L (continue left), U (up), or D (down), but not R (right) because that would be instant reverse. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Current direction is L, so opposite is R, so cannot move right. Allowed moves: L, U, D.\n\nNow, grid: let's sketch this to visualize.\n\nGrid from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls: borders, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (2,1)\n\nThen: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)  // all on y=1, x from 3 to 6\n\nThen (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2)  // on row y=2, x from 6 down to 3\n\nThen (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)  // on y=3, x=3,4,5\n\nThen (5,4), (4,4)  // on y=4, x=5 and x=4\n\nTail at (4,4)\n\nNow, food at (6,3) and (1,5)\n\n(6,3) is at row y=3, x=6\n\n(1,5) at x=1, y=5\n\nSnake head at (2,1), moving left, so from (2,1), moving left would go to (1,1), but (1,1) is not a wall? Walls are borders, so x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 is not wall, y=1 is not wall since y=0 is bottom? Coordinates: let's define.\n\nTypically, (0,0) bottom-left, or top-left? The problem doesn't specify, but in grid problems, often (0,0) is top-left or bottom-left. But since y=0 is a wall, and snake is at y=1, which is above y=0, probably y increases upwards or downwards? Movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so if U increases y, and walls at y=0 and y=7, likely y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top, so U increases y (up), D decreases y (down).\n\nSimilarly, L decreases x, R increases x.\n\nSo grid:\n\n- Bottom row: y=0 (wall)\n\n- Top row: y=7 (wall)\n\n- Left column: x=0 (wall)\n\n- Right column: x=7 (wall)\n\nAlso internal wall at (4,6)\n\nNow snake at (2,1): head\n\nThen (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) // all at y=1, x=2 to 6? Head is (2,1), then (3,1), so x increasing, but head moving left? Current position: head at (2,1), previous must have been (3,1) or something? Positions list: [(2,1), (3,1), ...] so head is first, then body. Since head direction is L, it was moving left to (2,1) from, say, (3,1) at previous turn? At turn 57, snake positions are given, head at (2,1), and direction L, meaning it is facing left, so it came from the right.\n\nAt turn 56, head was at (3,1), moved left to (2,1) at turn 57.\n\nBody segments: after head (2,1), it's (3,1), which is the segment that was head at turn 56, then (4,1), etc.\n\nNow, from (2,1), possible moves:\n\n- Left (L) to (1,1)\n\n- Up (U) to (2,2)\n\n- Down (D) to (2,0) but y=0 is wall, so invalid\n\n- Right (R) to (3,1) but (3,1) is body segment, and also instant reverse not allowed, so R invalid.\n\nSo possible moves: L to (1,1) or U to (2,2)\n\nNow, (1,1): is it occupied? Snake positions: (2,1), (3,1), etc., no (1,1), so empty? But we need to check if it's wall or not.\n\nx=1, y=1: not border wall, and no internal obstacle mentioned, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2): is it occupied? Snake positions: (3,2), (4,2), etc., (2,2) not in list, so free.\n\nBut (2,2) might be a cell the snake can move to.\n\nNow, food: (6,3) and (1,5)\n\n(6,3) is close, but head at (2,1), so not adjacent.\n\n(1,5) is at (1,5), which is up and left.\n\nI need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's list all occupied cells by snake.\n\nSnake positions: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)\n\nSo body cells: (3,1) to (4,4) except head (2,1)\n\nFree cells: for example, (1,1), (2,2), (1,2), (3,2) is occupied, etc.\n\n(3,2) is occupied, but (2,2) is not, (1,1) not, (1,2) not, (2,3) not, etc.\n\nFood at (6,3): which is not occupied by snake, since snake has (5,3) and (6,2), (6,3) is free? Snake positions: (5,3) at index 11, (6,2) at index 6, (6,1) at index 5, so (6,3) is not in list, so it's free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) free.\n\nBut (6,3) has food with value 1, life span 3.\n\nNow, head at (2,1), moving to (1,1) or (2,2).\n\nIf I move to (1,1), then at turn 58, head at (1,1), direction L (since moved left).\n\nThen from (1,1), possible moves: L to (0,1) but x=0 wall, invalid; U to (1,2); D to (1,0) y=0 wall invalid; R to (2,1) but (2,1) is now body? At turn 58, snake moves: head to new position, tail moves away, so (2,1) might be free if tail moves.\n\nAt turn 57: positions [(2,1), (3,1), ..., (4,4)]\n\nAfter move: if head moves to (1,1), then new positions: head (1,1), then the body: (2,1), (3,1), ..., up to the second last, but since we eat food only if we move onto it, and no food at (1,1), so length same, tail (4,4) is removed, so new tail is (3,2)? Let's see the list.\n\nCurrent positions: index 0: (2,1) head, 1: (3,1), 2: (4,1), 3: (5,1), 4: (6,1), 5: (6,2), 6: (5,2), 7: (4,2), 8: (3,2), 9: (3,3), 10: (4,3), 11: (5,3), 12: (5,4), 13: (4,4) tail.\n\nIf head moves to (1,1), no food, so tail is removed, new positions: head (1,1), then body: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)  // (4,4) removed, so tail now (5,4)\n\nLength still 14? No, after move without eating, length decreases? No: when not eating, head moves to new cell, tail is removed, so length decreases? But snake length should stay the same unless eating food.\n\nRule: when moving, if head moves to a cell with food, then snake grows, so tail not removed, length +1. If no food, tail is removed, length unchanged.\n\nIn this case, no food at (1,1), so after moving to (1,1), new head (1,1), body from (2,1) to (5,4), but since tail (4,4) removed, the last segment (5,4) becomes tail, so positions: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4) — 14 segments? Original had 14, after move: head new, and all body except tail removed, so number of segments: head + all previous body except tail not added, so length decreases by 1? No.\n\nStandard snake: when no food eaten, head moves to new cell, tail cell is vacated, so snake length remains the same, but the tail segment is removed from the list.\n\nFor example, positions list has n segments. After move without eating, new head position, and the body positions from index 0 to n-2 are kept, but shifted, and the last one (tail) is removed. So new list has n-1 positions? No.\n\nLet’s say positions: [H, B1, B2, ..., T] where T is tail.\n\nAfter move without eating: new head position P, then new body: [P, H, B1, B2, ..., B_{k-1}] where B_{k-1} is the new tail, and T is removed. So the number of segments remains the same, but the snake has moved, so the cell T is free now.\n\nIn terms of list length: original list has L positions. After move:\n\n- If no food: new head position, then the first L-1 positions of the old list become the body, so new list: [new_head, old_head, old_body1, ..., old_body_{L-2}] , and old_tail is removed. So length still L.\n\nFor example, L=14 positions.\n\nAfter move to new cell without food: new positions: [new_head, old_head, old_pos[1], old_pos[2], ..., old_pos[12]] , old_pos[13] (tail) removed. old_pos[0] is head, old_pos[1] to old_pos[13] are body and tail.\n\nIndex: 0: head, 1: body, ..., 12: body, 13: tail.\n\nAfter move: new_head at new position, then body: old_head (now first body), old_pos[1], old_pos[2], ..., old_pos[12] (which was the segment before tail, now tail).\n\nSo new tail is old_pos[12], which was (5,4) in this case, and old tail (4,4) removed.\n\nPositions: old: [ (2,1)h, (3,1)b, (4,1)b, (5,1)b, (6,1)b, (6,2)b, (5,2)b, (4,2)b, (3,2)b, (3,3)b, (4,3)b, (5,3)b, (5,4)b, (4,4)t ]\n\nIf move to (1,1) no food: new head (1,1), then body: old head (2,1), then old body (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), and old (5,4) which was index 12, now becomes tail, and old tail (4,4) index 13 removed.\n\nSo new positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)]  // tail at (5,4)\n\nLength still 14.\n\nSimilarly, if move up to (2,2), no food, new head (2,2), body: old head (2,1), then old body (3,1), (4,1), etc., up to old (5,4), and tail (4,4) removed, new tail (5,4).\n\nBack to decision.\n\nAt turn 57, from (2,1), options:\n\n- Move L to (1,1)\n\n- Move U to (2,2)\n\nD not possible, wall; R not possible, body or reverse.\n\n(2,0) is wall, so D invalid.\n\nR to (3,1) is occupied by body and reverse, so invalid.\n\nSo only L or U.\n\nNow, think ahead 5+ turns.\n\nFirst, food (6,3) has life span 3, so at turn 57,58,59 present, gone at turn 60.\n\n(1,5) life span 8, present from 57 to 64.\n\n(6,3) is closer, but head at (2,1), (6,3) is at (6,3), which is 4 steps away in Manhattan distance, but with obstacles.\n\nFrom (2,1) to (6,3): need to go right and up, but snake body in the way.\n\nCurrent head at (2,1), to reach (6,3), one path could be right to (3,1), but (3,1) is body, occupied now, but when snake moves, it might free up.\n\nBut at turn 57, (3,1) is occupied.\n\nLet's plan a path.\n\nSince the snake is long, it might be risky to go towards the body.\n\nAlso, the tail is at (4,4), so if head goes near tail, need to be careful with \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills, but here no food on tail.\n\nFirst, let's evaluate moving left to (1,1).\n\nTurn 57: move L to (1,1), no food.\n\nThen at turn 58, head at (1,1), direction L.\n\nFrom (1,1), possible moves: U to (1,2), since L to (0,1) wall, D to (1,0) wall, R to (2,1) which is now body? At turn 58, positions: after turn 57 move, head at (1,1), body: (2,1), (3,1), ..., (5,4) as above.\n\n(2,1) is body, so moving R to (2,1) would collide with body.\n\nAlso, cannot move L or D, walls.\n\nSo only possible move from (1,1) is U to (1,2).\n\nMust move up.\n\nTurn 58: move U to (1,2)\n\nNow, is there food at (1,2)? Food at (1,5), not (1,2), so no food, so tail moves, etc.\n\nHead at (1,2), direction U.\n\nThen at turn 59, from (1,2), possible moves: U to (1,3), D to (1,1) but (1,1) is now body? After move to (1,2), positions: head (1,2), body (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), ..., (5,4) but tail is (5,4), and (1,1) is body.\n\nD to (1,1) would be body collision.\n\nL to (0,2) wall.\n\nR to (2,2) — is (2,2) free? Snake positions: (2,1) is body, (3,2) is body, but (2,2) not in positions, so free? Let's see.\n\nPositions at turn 58 after move to (1,2): head (1,2), then body: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)  // (5,4) tail\n\n(2,2) not in list, so free.\n\nAlso, U to (1,3) free probably.\n\nSo from (1,2), moves: U to (1,3), or R to (2,2), D and L invalid.\n\nNow, food at (1,5) is up, so U is towards it.\n\nBut (1,5) is at y=5, head at (1,2) y=2, so 3 steps up.\n\nAlso, (6,3) food will disappear after turn 59, so at turn 59 it is still there, but head at (1,2) at turn 59, far from (6,3), so cannot reach in time.\n\n(6,3) at turn 59: life span decreases, at turn 57 L=3, turn 58 L=2, turn 59 L=1, present, turn 60 gone.\n\nAt turn 59, head at (1,2) or (2,2), far from (6,3), so cannot eat (6,3).\n\nSo this path misses (6,3).\n\nNow, if at turn 57 I move up to (2,2) instead.\n\nTurn 57: move U to (2,2)\n\nIs there food? (2,2) no food, so no eat.\n\nThen new positions: head (2,2), body: old head (2,1), then old body (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)  // tail (5,4), old tail (4,4) removed.\n\nDirection now U, since moved up.\n\nAt turn 58, head at (2,2), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,3), D to (2,1) but (2,1) is body, collision; L to (1,2), R to (3,2) but (3,2) is body? Positions: (3,2) is body, yes.\n\n(2,1) is body, (3,2) is body.\n\nL to (1,2): is it free? Not occupied, no wall.\n\nR to (3,2): occupied, body.\n\nD to (2,1): occupied.\n\nU to (2,3): free? (2,3) not in positions, so free.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (2,3) or L to (1,2)\n\nNow, food at (6,3) and (1,5)\n\n(6,3) is at (6,3), head at (2,2), so can go towards it.\n\nFor example, move U to (2,3) or L to (1,2).\n\nBut (6,3) needs to be eaten by turn 59.\n\nTurn 57: moved to (2,2)\n\nTurn 58: if move U to (2,3), then head at (2,3)\n\nThen turn 59: from (2,3), can move to (2,4), (3,3), (1,3), etc.\n\n(3,3) is body? Positions at turn 58 after U to (2,3): head (2,3), body: (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)  // tail (5,4)\n\n(3,3) is body, so cannot move to (3,3).\n\nFrom (2,3), moves: U to (2,4), D to (2,2) but (2,2) body, collision; L to (1,3), R to (3,3) body, collision.\n\nSo only U to (2,4) or L to (1,3)\n\n(2,4) free? Yes.\n\n(1,3) free? Yes.\n\nTo reach (6,3) by turn 59, but (6,3) is at x=6,y=3, head at (2,3) at turn 58, so at turn 59 can go to (3,3) but (3,3) is body, not free, or to (2,4) or (1,3), both farther from (6,3).\n\nFrom (2,3), cannot go to (3,3) because occupied.\n\nSo at turn 59, head at (2,4) or (1,3), both not (6,3), and (6,3) disappears after turn 59, so cannot eat it.\n\nIf at turn 58, from (2,2), I move L to (1,2) instead of U.\n\nTurn 58: move L to (1,2)\n\nNo food, positions: head (1,2), body (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), ..., (5,4) tail.\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen turn 59: from (1,2), can move U to (1,3), D to (1,1) but (1,1) free? Not occupied, no wall, but in positions? (1,1) not in list, free.\n\nL to (0,2) wall, R to (2,2) body, collision.\n\nSo moves: U to (1,3) or D to (1,1)\n\nThen to (1,3) or (1,1), still far from (6,3).\n\nSo in both cases, from initial move U at turn 57, I cannot reach (6,3) in time to eat it before it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, if I moved L at turn 57 to (1,1), then to (1,2) at turn 58, then to (1,3) or (2,2) at turn 59, still not at (6,3).\n\nSo (6,3) cannot be eaten; it's too far and the path is blocked by body.\n\nTherefore, I should focus on the other food at (1,5), which has longer life span.\n\nAlso, there might be other areas to explore.\n\nBut first, let's think about survival.\n\nThe snake is in a bit of a tight spot; it's coiled, and moving carelessly might cause collision.\n\nFor example, the area around (3,2) to (5,4) has many body segments.\n\nIf I move towards the center, might trap myself.\n\nMoving left to (1,1) then up might be safer to go towards (1,5).\n\nSimilarly, moving up to (2,2) then left to (1,2) etc.\n\nBut let's see the map.\n\nList all free cells.\n\nGrid 8x8, walls at borders and (4,6).\n\nSnake occupies: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)\n\nSo occupied cells: rows y=1: x=2,3,4,5,6\n\ny=2: x=6,5,4,3 (since (6,2),(5,2),(4,2),(3,2))\n\ny=3: x=3,4,5 ( (3,3),(4,3),(5,3) )\n\ny=4: x=5,4 ( (5,4),(4,4) )\n\nAlso, internal wall at (4,6), but y=6, x=4.\n\nFree cells: for example, (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) food, (1,6), (1,7) but y=7 wall, so (1,7) invalid.\n\nx=1, y from 1 to 6: (1,1) free, (1,2) free, (1,3) free, (1,4) free, (1,5) food, (1,6) free? But (4,6) is obstacle, but (1,6) not obstacle, no wall, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) free, (2,3) free, (2,4) free, (2,5) free, etc.\n\n(3,4) free? Not occupied, no wall.\n\n(4,4) is occupied, tail.\n\n(4,5) free, (4,6) wall, (4,7) wall.\n\n(5,5) free, (5,6) free? (5,6) not wall except borders, y=6<7, x=5<7, not border, and (4,6) obstacle but different cell, so (5,6) free.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) food, (6,4) free, (6,5) free, (6,6) free, etc.\n\nBut (6,3) has food but disappearing soon.\n\nNow, back to decision at turn 57.\n\nIf I move L to (1,1), then as before, only can move U to (1,2) at turn 58.\n\nThen at turn 59, from (1,2), can move U to (1,3) or R to (2,2) if possible.\n\nAt turn 59, after moving to (1,2) at turn 58, positions: head (1,2), body (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)  // tail (5,4)\n\nFrom (1,2), moves: U to (1,3), D to (1,1) body collision, L wall, R to (2,2) which is free, not occupied.\n\nSo can move U or R.\n\nIf move U to (1,3), towards food (1,5).\n\nIf move R to (2,2), then into the body area.\n\n(2,2) is free, but surrounded by body? (2,2) free, (3,2) body, etc.\n\nBut moving to (2,2) might be risky if not careful.\n\nSimilarly, from (2,2), can go to (2,3) or other.\n\nBut to maximize score, eating (1,5) is good.\n\n(1,5) has value 1, and life span 8, so plenty of time.\n\nAlso, after eating, snake grows, which might make it harder to maneuver, but we need to survive.\n\nAnother thing: the tail is at (5,4), and it will move as the snake moves.\n\nNow, if I go towards (1,5), I can eat it in a few turns.\n\nFor example, from turn 57, if I move U to (2,2), then at turn 58, from (2,2), I can move L to (1,2), then at turn 59, from (1,2), move U to (1,3), then turn 60 to (1,4), turn 61 to (1,5) eat.\n\nThat's 4 turns from turn 57 to reach (1,5) at turn 61.\n\nTurn 57: move to (2,2) or (1,1)\n\nIf turn 57 move U to (2,2)\n\nTurn 58: from (2,2), move L to (1,2) — is it possible? From (2,2), direction U (since moved up at 57), so at turn 58, moves: U to (2,3), D to (2,1) body, L to (1,2), R to (3,2) body.\n\nSo L to (1,2) is possible.\n\nThen move L to (1,2), no food.\n\nThen turn 59: head at (1,2), direction L (since moved left).\n\nMoves: U to (1,3), D to (1,1) body, L wall, R to (2,2) body? At turn 59, after move to (1,2), positions: head (1,2), body (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), ..., (5,4) tail.\n\n(2,2) is body, so R to (2,2) collision.\n\nU to (1,3) or D to (1,1) but (1,1) is body? Positions: (1,1) is body, yes, so D to (1,1) collision.\n\nL wall.\n\nSo only U to (1,3).\n\nMust move up.\n\nThen turn 59: move U to (1,3)\n\nNo food.\n\nThen turn 60: head at (1,3), direction U.\n\nMoves: U to (1,4), D to (1,2) body, L wall, R to (2,3) — is (2,3) free? Not occupied, so possible.\n\nBut to go to (1,5), should move U.\n\nIf move U to (1,4)\n\nThen turn 61: to (1,5) eat.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 57 I move L to (1,1), then turn 58 move U to (1,2), turn 59 move U to (1,3), turn 60 to (1,4), turn 61 to (1,5) eat.\n\nSame number of turns.\n\nBut in both cases, at turn 61 eat (1,5).\n\nNow, life span of (1,5) is 8, from turn 57 to 64, so at turn 61 it is still present (turn 61: 57+4=61, L at turn 57=8, turn 58=7, ..., turn 61=4, present).\n\nSo can eat it.\n\nNow, is there a risk?\n\nFor example, after eating, snake grows, length 15, and head at (1,5), then need to move away without hitting body.\n\nBut at that point, body is behind, so as long as I don't reverse into it, should be ok.\n\nFor example, after eating at (1,5), positions: head (1,5), then since ate, tail not removed, so body includes previous positions.\n\nBut the area around (1,5) might have space.\n\n(1,6) is free, (2,5) free, etc.\n\nAlso, the internal wall at (4,6) is not an issue.\n\nBut we need to think beyond eating the food.\n\nSince the snake is long, and the grid has walls, we might need to find a path to stay alive.\n\nAnother option: at turn 57, if I move U to (2,2), then at turn 58, instead of moving left, I could move up to (2,3), but that might not help for (1,5).\n\n(1,5) is at (1,5), so moving to (2,3) is away from it.\n\nFrom (2,3), I can go left to (1,3) then up, but takes more turns.\n\nFor example, turn 57: U to (2,2)\n\nTurn 58: U to (2,3) — from (2,2) move U to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 59: from (2,3), can move U to (2,4) or L to (1,3) (since R and D not possible, as before)\n\nSay move L to (1,3)\n\nThen turn 60: from (1,3) move U to (1,4) or to (1,5)? (1,5) not adjacent, to (1,4) first.\n\nTurn 60 to (1,4), then turn 61 to (1,5) eat.\n\nSame as before, but I went to (2,3) first, which is not necessary.\n\nDirectly moving towards (1,5) is better.\n\nIn the first path, by moving left or up initially, I can reach (1,5) in 4 moves.\n\nBut at turn 57, if I move U to (2,2), and at turn 58 move L to (1,2), then to (1,3), etc.\n\nIf I move L to (1,1) at turn 57, then U to (1,2) at 58, then U to (1,3) at 59, U to (1,4) at 60, U to (1,5) at 61.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, is there a difference?\n\nWhen I move to (1,1) at turn 57, I am closer to the left wall, which might be riskier if I need to turn, but since I can only go up, it should be fine.\n\nSimilarly, from (2,2), moving left to (1,2) is similar.\n\nBut at (2,2), I have the option to go up instead, but that delays reaching the food.\n\nSince (1,5) is the only food available for now, and (6,3) is not reachable, I should go for (1,5).\n\nMoreover, after eating, I need to have space to move.\n\nThe grid has free cells on the left side: (1,3) to (1,6), and also (2,3) to (2,6), etc.\n\nFor example, from (1,5), after eating, I can move to (1,6) or (2,5), etc.\n\n(1,6) is free, y=6, not wall, x=1.\n\nThen from there, to (1,7) but y=7 wall, or to (2,6), etc.\n\nSo there is space.\n\nNow, about the \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills, but here no food on tail, so no issue.\n\nAlso, food can spawn under body, but in this case, food at (6,3) and (1,5) are not under snake, I think.\n\n(6,3) is free, (1,5) free.\n\nNow, to decide the move at turn 57.\n\nBoth L and U are possible, but moving L directly to (1,1) might be slightly better because it gets me closer to (1,5) in the x-direction, but since y also needs to increase, it's similar.\n\nFrom (2,1), moving L to (1,1) decreases x to 1, same y.\n\nMoving U to (2,2) increases y to 2, same x.\n\nThen to (1,5), need to go to x=1, y=5.\n\nFrom (1,1) at y=1, need to go up 4 steps.\n\nFrom (2,2) at y=2, need to go to x=1 and y=5, so move left then up.\n\nBut as above, both take 4 turns to reach (1,5).\n\nAt turn 57, if move L to (1,1), then turn 58 U to (1,2), turn 59 U to (1,3), turn 60 U to (1,4), turn 61 U to (1,5) eat.\n\nSimilarly, if move U to (2,2) at 57, turn 58 L to (1,2), turn 59 U to (1,3), turn 60 U to (1,4), turn 61 U to (1,5) eat.\n\nExactly the same.\n\nBut at turn 59, from (1,2) moving U to (1,3), no choice.\n\nIn the first case, when at (1,1) at turn 58, I must move U, no other choice.\n\nAt (2,2) at turn 58, I can choose to move L to (1,2) or U to (2,3).\n\nIf I move U to (2,3), it delays reaching (1,5), so better to move directly towards the food.\n\nSo for maximizing score, I should go directly to (1,5).\n\nTherefore, at turn 57, moving L or U both lead to the same path essentially.\n\nBut let's see if there is a risk of collision in one path.\n\nFor example, if I move to (1,1) at turn 57, then at turn 58 move to (1,2), at turn 59 to (1,3), etc.\n\nThe body is on the right, so as long as I don't go back, should be fine.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to (2,2) first, then to (1,2), same thing.\n\nBut when I move to (2,2) at turn 57, the cell (2,2) was free, but after moving, it becomes body.\n\nThen when I move to (1,2) at turn 58, (1,2) is free.\n\nNow, another thing: the tail is moving.\n\nFor example, in the sequence, when I move, the tail moves away.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm going left and up, away from the tail, no issue.\n\nPerhaps moving L at turn 57 is fine.\n\nBut let's think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nSuppose turn 57: move L to (1,1)\n\nTurn 58: move U to (1,2)  // only choice\n\nTurn 59: move U to (1,3)  // from (1,2), only U possible, as D and R not possible\n\nTurn 60: move U to (1,4)\n\nTurn 61: move U to (1,5) and eat, snake grows, length 15.\n\nNow at turn 61, head at (1,5), direction U.\n\nPositions: after eating, head at (1,5), body: previous head (1,4), and all body, tail not removed.\n\nPrevious at turn 60: head at (1,4), body (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4) — but length was 14, after eating, no tail removal, so positions: [ (1,5) head, (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4) ] // 15 segments, tail at (5,4)\n\n(5,4) is tail.\n\nNow head at (1,5), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (1,6), D to (1,4) body, L wall, R to (2,5)\n\n(2,5) free? Not occupied, yes.\n\nSo can move U to (1,6) or R to (2,5)\n\nThen continue.\n\nSimilarly, if I had gone via (2,2), similar situation.\n\nBut with the direct left then up, I have the snake stretching along y=1 to y=5 at x=1, but part of it is on the left column.\n\nNow, to survive, I can go to (1,6) or (2,5), etc.\n\nFor example, (1,6) free, then from there to (1,7) wall, or to (2,6), etc.\n\nNo immediate danger.\n\nTherefore, it seems safe.\n\nBut is there a reason to prefer one initial move over the other?\n\nAt turn 57, if I move U to (2,2), then at turn 58 I have a choice: move L to (1,2) or U to (2,3).\n\nIf I move U to (2,3), I might be able to access other areas, but (1,5) is the only food, so better to go directly to it.\n\nMoreover, moving to (2,3) might lead to being trapped or something.\n\nFor example, from (2,3), I can go to (2,4), (1,3), (3,3) but (3,3) body, etc.\n\nBut not necessary.\n\nSo I think moving directly towards (1,5) is best.\n\nTherefore, at turn 57, either move L or U, but since moving L gets me to x=1 immediately, which is the column of the food, and then I just need to go up, it might be simpler.\n\nMoving U to (2,2) then L to (1,2) is the same.\n\nBut in terms of the answer, I need to specify the action.\n\nSince both are valid, but let's see the head direction.\n\nCurrent direction L, moving L continues left, moving U changes to up.\n\nBut not a big deal.\n\nI think I should move left to (1,1) at turn 57.\n\nThen the sequence is fixed until eating.\n\nBut at turn 59, from (1,2), I can only move U, etc.\n\nIn the answer format, I need to provide actions for multiple turns, but the instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead, but for the answer, it says \"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ... }\"\n\nBut it doesn't specify how many turns to list. Since it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", I should list actions for 5 turns or more.\n\nBut in the sequence above, after turn 57, the moves are determined until turn 61.\n\nBut at turn 61, after eating, I have choices.\n\nBut for now, I can list up to eating the food.\n\nSince the food at (1,5) is the target, and I reach it at turn 61.\n\nTurn 57 to turn 61 is 5 turns: 57,58,59,60,61.\n\nt1=57, t1+1=58, ..., up to t1+4=61.\n\nActions: turn 57: move L to (1,1)\n\nThen turn 58: from (1,1) move U to (1,2)\n\nTurn 59: from (1,2) move U to (1,3)\n\nTurn 60: from (1,3) move U to (1,4)\n\nTurn 61: from (1,4) move U to (1,5) and eat.\n\nIn this, at turn 60, head at (1,4), move U to (1,5).\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 59 head at (1,3), turn 60 to (1,4), turn 61 to (1,5).\n\nYes.\n\nIf I start with U at turn 57, it would be: turn 57 U to (2,2), turn 58 L to (1,2), turn 59 U to (1,3), same as above.\n\nBut with initial L, I avoid the body area more quickly.\n\nFor example, if I move U to (2,2), (2,2) is closer to the body, but since it's free, no problem.\n\nBut moving L to (1,1) gets me to the wall, but I can only go up, so it might be safer from collision.\n\nI think both are fine, but I'll go with moving left.\n\nSo for turn 57: move L\n\nThen subsequent moves as above.\n\nBut in the answer, I need to list the actions.\n\nNow, for thinking ahead, after eating at turn 61, I need to continue, but since no other food, I should explore or stay safe.\n\nBut for now, I can list the actions for 5 turns.\n\nSince the problem says \"maximize score\", and score comes from eating food, and (1,5) is the only one I can eat, I should eat it.\n\nAfter that, I need to survive to eat more food that might appear, but not specified, so for now, eating this food is the goal.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with the sequence to eat (1,5).\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 57: L\n\nTurn 58: U\n\nTurn 59: U\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: U\n\nBut at turn 58, from (1,1), must U, yes.\n\nAt turn 59, from (1,2), must U, etc.\n\nIn the sequence, after turn 57 move L, head at (1,1), direction L.\n\nThen turn 58 move U to (1,2), direction changes to U.\n\nThen turn 59 move U to (1,3), direction U.\n\nTurn 60 U to (1,4), U.\n\nTurn 61 U to (1,5), U.\n\nAll good.\n\nIf I move U at turn 57, then turn 58 move L to (1,2), which is left, but from (2,2) moving to (1,2), direction L.\n\nThen turn 59 U to (1,3), direction changes to U.\n\nSame from there.\n\nBut with initial L, the direction is consistent for the first move.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nNow, about the food (6,3): it will disappear, but I can't reach it, so no issue.\n\nAlso, in the state, no negative food, so all food is positive.\n\nTherefore, I think this is the plan.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating the positive food at (1,5) while ensuring long-term survival, I must plan at least 5 turns ahead. The food at (6,3) has a short life span (disappears after turn 59) and is unreachable from the current position (2,1) within 2 turns due to the snake's body blocking direct paths. Therefore, I prioritize reaching the food at (1,5), which has a longer life span (present until turn 64) and can be eaten by turn 61. Moving left (L) at turn 57 starts the path toward (1,5) efficiently, as it reduces the x-coordinate to 1 immediately. Subsequent moves are constrained by the need to avoid walls, body collisions, and instant reversals, leading to a deterministic sequence of upward (U) moves to reach (1,5) safely.\n\n### Key Considerations for the Plan:\n- **Current State (Turn 57)**:\n  - Snake head at (2,1), direction L (left).\n  - Possible moves from (2,1): L to (1,1) or U to (2,2) (D and R are invalid due to wall and body/instant reverse).\n  - Moving L to (1,1) is chosen to minimize distance to (1,5) and avoid body-heavy areas.\n- **Path to Food (1,5)**:\n  - From (1,1), only U to (1,2) is possible at turn 58 (other moves are invalid).\n  - From (1,2), only U to (1,3) is possible at turn 59 (other moves are invalid).\n  - From (1,3), only U to (1,4) is possible at turn 60 (other moves are invalid).\n  - From (1,4), U to (1,5) at turn 61 eats the food, increasing length by 1.\n- **Risk Assessment**:\n  - No negative food exists, so eating (1,5) is safe.\n  - The tail is at (5,4) initially, far from the path, so no \"Tail Reward Danger\".\n  - The path stays near the left wall but has free cells above (e.g., (1,6)) for future movement after eating.\n  - Body collisions are avoided as the snake moves away from its body into open areas.\n- **5-Turn Lookahead**:\n  - Turn 57: Move L to (1,1) – positions: head (1,1), body (2,1) to (5,4), tail (5,4).\n  - Turn 58: Move U to (1,2) – positions: head (1,2), body (1,1), (2,1) to (5,4), tail (5,4).\n  - Turn 59: Move U to (1,3) – positions: head (1,3), body (1,2), (1,1), (2,1) to (5,4), tail (5,4).\n  - Turn 60: Move U to (1,4) – positions: head (1,4), body (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1) to (5,4), tail (5,4).\n  - Turn 61: Move U to (1,5) and eat – positions: head (1,5), body includes all previous plus growth, tail at (5,3) or similar (length 15).\n- **Beyond Turn 61**:\n  - After eating, head at (1,5) with direction U. Possible moves: U to (1,6) or R to (2,5), both safe. U to (1,6) is recommended to continue upward into free space, then explore right toward (2,6) to avoid trapping near walls.\n\nThis plan safely achieves the food at (1,5) by turn 61, maximizing score with minimal risk. The sequence for turns 57 to 61 is fixed due to movement constraints, ensuring survival.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 57: L\nTurn 58: U\nTurn 59: U\nTurn 60: U\nTurn 61: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6). There's also an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nThe snake positions are given as a list: head at (1,1), then (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4). That's 14 segments. Let me plot this to visualize.\n\nCurrent head direction is L, which is left. So the snake is moving left.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (6,3) with life span 2, value +1 (positive food)\n\n- (1,5) with life span 7, value +1\n\n- (4,3) with life span 10, value +1. But (4,3) is also a body segment of the snake. According to the rules, food can spawn under the body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's map out the current grid.\n\nGrid size: 7x7, cells (1,1) to (6,6). Walls at borders and obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- Head: (1,1)\n\n- Body: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)\n\nFrom head to tail: (1,1) head, then (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), and tail at (5,4).\n\nTail is at (5,4).\n\nCurrent direction is L (left), so from (1,1), moving left would go to (0,1), but x=0 is a wall, so moving left is impossible. (1,1) moving left to (0,1) is out of bounds, so that's a wall collision. Therefore, I cannot move left; it would kill the snake.\n\nBut the head direction is given as L, but since it's at (1,1), moving left is invalid. I need to choose a different direction.\n\nThe snake head direction is L, meaning it was moving left to reach (1,1), but now for the next move, I can choose U, D, L, or R, but with the constraint that I cannot instantly reverse. Since current direction is L, reverse would be R, so I cannot move right immediately. But moving left is impossible due to wall.\n\nPossible moves from (1,1):\n\n- Up: to (1,2) - is this valid? y=2 is within 1 to 6, and (1,2) is not a wall or body? Let's check.\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7 or y=0,7, so (1,2) is playable.\n\nNow, is (1,2) occupied by body? Snake positions: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), etc. No (1,2), so (1,2) should be free.\n\n- Down: to (1,0) but y=0 is wall, invalid.\n\n- Left: to (0,1) x=0 wall, invalid.\n\n- Right: to (2,1) but (2,1) is the first body segment. Moving to (2,1) would cause collision, since head touches body immediately.\n\n(2,1) is occupied by the snake body, so moving right to (2,1) would be head colliding with body.\n\nTherefore, from (1,1), with current direction L, possible moves:\n\n- Up: to (1,2) - seems free\n\n- Down: to (1,0) - wall, invalid\n\n- Left: to (0,1) - wall, invalid\n\n- Right: to (2,1) - body, collision, invalid\n\nBut right is reverse direction? Current direction is L, reverse is R. I cannot instantly reverse, but even if I could, it's invalid because of body.\n\nSo only possible move is Up to (1,2).\n\nIs that correct? Let me confirm the body positions.\n\nSnake: positions list: [(1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4)]\n\nSo at turn 58, head is at (1,1). The next segment is (2,1), so if I move right to (2,1), head would be at same position as the first body segment, which is collision.\n\nSimilarly, up to (1,2): is (1,2) in the list? No, not listed, so free.\n\nDown to (1,0): y=0, wall.\n\nLeft to (0,1): x=0, wall.\n\nSo indeed, only possible move is Up to (1,2).\n\nBut the current head direction is L. After moving up, the new direction would be U.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the food.\n\nFood at:\n\n- (6,3) life span 2, value +1\n\n- (1,5) life span 7, value +1\n\n- (4,3) life span 10, value +1, but (4,3) is currently occupied by a body segment. Specifically, in the snake positions, (4,3) is the 12th segment or something. Let's see: positions index from head: 0:(1,1), 1:(2,1), 2:(3,1), 3:(4,1), 4:(5,1), 5:(6,1), 6:(6,2), 7:(5,2), 8:(4,2), 9:(3,2), 10:(3,3), 11:(4,3), 12:(5,3), 13:(5,4) tail.\n\nSo (4,3) is position 11, which is a body segment. Food is at (4,3), so it's under the body. To eat it, the body must move away first, then head can move onto it later.\n\nNow, life span: (6,3) has life span 2, meaning it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n\nCurrent turn is 58, so for (6,3), life span 2, so it will disappear after turn 59? Let's see: life span N, disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n\nSo at turn t, food has life span L, it will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1? I need to clarify.\n\nTypically: if life span is N at turn t, then after N turns, it disappears. Countdown decreases each turn.\n\nSo at turn t, countdown is N.\n\nAfter turn t, countdown becomes N-1.\n\nIf countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nSo for food at (6,3) with life span 2 at turn 58:\n\n- Turn 58: countdown=2\n\n- After turn 58, countdown=1 (still present at start of turn 59)\n\n- After turn 59, countdown=0, disappears, so not present for turn 60.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) life span 7: present until turn 58+7-1=64? After turn 64, it disappears.\n\nAt start of turn 58, life span 7, so:\n\n- Turn 58: countdown=7\n\n- Turn 59: countdown=6\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn 64: countdown=1\n\n- Turn 65: countdown=0, disappears after turn 65? Let's define.\n\nAfter each turn, the countdown decreases.\n\nAfter turn t, countdown decrements.\n\nIf countdown was 1 at start of turn, after the turn, it becomes 0 and disappears.\n\nSo for (6,3): life span 2 at turn 58, so at start of turn 58: countdown=2\n\nAfter turn 58: countdown=1, still there\n\nAfter turn 59: countdown=0, disappears, so not present for turn 60.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5): life span 7, present from turn 58 to turn 64 (after turn 64, countdown=0, gone for turn 65)\n\nStart turn 58: countdown=7\n\nAfter turn 58: countdown=6\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 64: countdown=0, gone for turn 65.\n\nTurn 65 starts with no food.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) life span 10: present until after turn 67? Start turn 58: countdown=10\n\nAfter turn 58:9\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 67: countdown=0, gone for turn 68.\n\nBut (4,3) is under body, so we may not eat it soon.\n\nNow, back to the move. At turn 58, from (1,1), only possible move is Up to (1,2), since other directions are blocked.\n\nSo for turn 58, I must move U.\n\nThen, after moving, snake will be: new head at (1,2), then the body: since head moved, the tail moves? When snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the next position, tail is removed unless food eaten.\n\nNo food eaten at (1,2), so after move, new positions: head at (1,2), then previous head (1,1) becomes first body, then (2,1), (3,1), ..., up to (5,4), but since no growth, the tail (5,4) is removed.\n\nSnake length is 14 segments. After moving without eating, head moves to (1,2), and the tail is removed, so body segments shift: the segment that was at index 0 moves to new head position? Standard snake movement: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n\nSo positions: let S be the list.\n\nAfter move to new head, new list: [new_head] + S[:-1] if no growth, meaning S[0] is old head, S[1] to S[-1] are body, tail S[-1].\n\nAfter moving to new cell C:\n\n- New head: C\n\n- New body: S[0], S[1], ..., S[len-2]  // all except the tail\n\nS has indices 0 to 13.\n\nS[0] is head at (1,1)\n\nAfter moving to (1,2):\n\nNew head: (1,2)\n\nNew body: S[0] = (1,1), then S[1] = (2,1), S[2]=(3,1), ..., up to S[12]=(5,3), and S[13]=(5,4) is tail and is removed.\n\nSo new positions: head (1,2), then (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)  // S[13] removed, so 13 segments now? Original 14 positions, after move, head new, body S[0] to S[12], which is 13 segments.\n\nS[0] to S[13] is 14 cells.\n\nAfter move: new head, then S[0], S[1], ..., S[12], which is 13 cells, since S[13] is dropped.\n\nYes, length decreases by one if no food eaten.\n\nIn this case, moving to (1,2), no food there, so snake becomes 13 segments.\n\nNow, head at (1,2), direction U.\n\nNext, I need to plan turns ahead.\n\nFirst, for turn 58, I must move U to (1,2).\n\nThen turn 59: from (1,2), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut cannot reverse, current direction U, so cannot move D (down).\n\nAlso, check for walls and body.\n\nFrom (1,2):\n\n- U: to (1,3) - is it free? Walls: y=3<7, ok. Body: positions after move: head (1,2), body: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)\n\n(1,3) not in list, so free.\n\n- D: to (1,1) - but (1,1) is now the first body segment, so collision. Also, D is reverse of U? Current direction U, reverse D, so cannot move down anyway.\n\n- L: to (0,2) x=0 wall, invalid.\n\n- R: to (2,2) - is (2,2) free? Not in body list, so yes.\n\n(2,2) not occupied.\n\nSo possible moves from (1,2): U to (1,3) or R to (2,2).\n\nD and L invalid.\n\nNow, I need to think about food and long-term.\n\nFood at (6,3) with short life, only 2 turns including current, so it will disappear after turn 59. That means I can only eat it on turn 58 or 59.\n\nBut turn 58 I'm moving to (1,2), nowhere near (6,3).\n\n(6,3) is at bottom right, I'm at top left.\n\nDistance: from (1,2) to (6,3) is |6-1|=5 in x, |3-2|=1 in y, so Manhattan distance 6, I can't reach in one move.\n\nAfter turn 58, I'm at (1,2), turn 59 I can move, but even if I go directly, min moves to (6,3) from (1,2) is 5 moves right and 1 up or something, but I have only one turn to eat it, turn 59.\n\nTurn 59: if I could reach (6,3), I can eat it, but from (1,2) to (6,3) in one move? Impossible, since max move one cell.\n\nSo I cannot eat (6,3) at all; it will disappear after turn 59.\n\nLife span: at turn 58, countdown=2, present for turn 58 and 59. After turn 59, it disappears, so I can eat it on turn 59 if head is on (6,3) during turn 59 move.\n\nBut from current position after turn 58, I'm at (1,2), which is far, so impossible to reach (6,3) by turn 59. So (6,3) is unattainable, I should ignore it.\n\nSimilarly, food at (1,5) and (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is currently under body, so I need to move the body away first.\n\nNow, after turn 58, snake positions: head (1,2), body: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)\n\n(4,3) is occupied by body.\n\nTo eat food at (4,3), I need to have the body move away so that (4,3) is free, then head can move there.\n\nBut currently, (4,3) is part of the body, so when the snake moves, this segment will move.\n\nLet's see the position of (4,3) in the body.\n\nAfter turn 58, positions: let's list with indices for clarity:\n\nIndex: 0: head (1,2)\n\n1: (1,1)\n\n2: (2,1)\n\n3: (3,1)\n\n4: (4,1)\n\n5: (5,1)\n\n6: (6,1)\n\n7: (6,2)\n\n8: (5,2)\n\n9: (4,2)\n\n10: (3,2)\n\n11: (3,3)\n\n12: (4,3)\n\n13: (5,3)  // tail, since (5,4) was removed.\n\nEarlier I said after move, positions: head (1,2), then (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)\n\nSo index 12: (4,3), which is where the food is, but it's occupied by body.\n\nWhen the snake moves on turn 59, each body segment moves to the position of the previous one.\n\nSpecifically, for segment at index 12 (4,3), it will move to the position of index 11, which is (3,3) at turn 59? Let's simulate turn 59.\n\nAt turn 59, head moves to a new position, say to (1,3) or (2,2).\n\nThen body segments: segment 1 moves to where head was, (1,2)\n\nSegment 2 moves to where segment 1 was, (1,1)\n\n...\n\nSegment 12 moves to where segment 11 was, which is (3,3)\n\nSegment 13 moves to where segment 12 was, which is (4,3)\n\nThen tail is removed.\n\nAfter move, the cell (4,3) might be free or not.\n\nIf head moves to (1,3) on turn 59:\n\nNew head: (1,3)\n\nThen new body: position 0 old: (1,2) -> new body[1]\n\nPosition 1 old: (1,1) -> new body[2]\n\nPosition 2 old: (2,1) -> new body[3]\n\n...\n\nPosition 11 old: (3,3) -> new body[12]\n\nPosition 12 old: (4,3) -> new body[13]\n\nPosition 13 old: (5,3) -> removed\n\nNew positions: head (1,3), body: (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3)\n\n(4,3) is now at the end, but it was moved to.\n\nThe food at (4,3) is still under the body, because (4,3) is occupied by the new tail or something.\n\nIn new positions, (4,3) is occupied by index 13, which is the last body segment before tail removal? In the list, after move, positions are new, with (4,3) at index 13.\n\nBut since we removed the tail, the tail was (5,3), so (4,3) is now part of body, not tail.\n\nFood at (4,3) is still under the snake body at index 13.\n\nIf I move differently, but for now, (4,3) remains occupied.\n\nTo free (4,3), I need the snake to move so that the segment at (4,3) moves away and no other segment is there.\n\nCurrently, after turn 58, (4,3) is occupied.\n\nOn turn 59, when snake moves, the segment at (4,3) will move to (3,3) if head moves up, for example.\n\nThen the cell (4,3) will be empty, because no segment is moving to it; the segment that was there moved away.\n\nIn the movement: when head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo for cell (4,3), at turn 58, it is occupied by a segment.\n\nOn turn 59, that segment moves to a new position, so (4,3) is vacated.\n\nThen, depending on the move, no other segment might move to (4,3) immediately, so it could be free.\n\nIn the example above, if head moves to (1,3), then segment at (4,3) moves to where segment 11 was, (3,3), so (4,3) is left empty.\n\nThen the food at (4,3) is now exposed and can be eaten if the head moves there.\n\nSimilarly, if head moves to (2,2), let's see.\n\nFirst, at turn 59, from (1,2), I can move U to (1,3) or R to (2,2).\n\nIf I move U to (1,3):\n\nAs above, after move, positions: head (1,3), body (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), ..., (3,3), (4,3)  // (4,3) is now the last position, but it's occupied, and food is there, but since the body moved away from it? No, after move, (4,3) is still occupied by the body segment that moved there.\n\nBefore move: positions include (4,3) at index 12.\n\nAfter move to (1,3): the segment that was at (4,3) moves to (3,3) (position of old index 11).\n\nSo the cell (4,3) is no longer occupied; it is free now.\n\nAnd food is at (4,3), so it is now accessible.\n\nBut the head is at (1,3), far away.\n\nIf on turn 59, I move head to (4,3), but from (1,2) to (4,3) is not possible in one move.\n\nSo on turn 59, after moving to (1,3) or (2,2), (4,3) becomes free, but head is not there.\n\nThen on subsequent turns, I can try to eat it.\n\nBut food at (4,3) has life span 10, so plenty of time.\n\nNow, the other food at (1,5), which is near me.\n\n(1,5) is at top, y=5, x=1.\n\nI am at (1,2) after turn 58.\n\nFrom (1,2) to (1,5) is same x, y difference 3, so I can go up directly.\n\nBut there might be obstacles.\n\nFirst, let's think about the immediate move.\n\nFor turn 58, I have no choice, must move U to (1,2).\n\nThen for turn 59, I need to decide between U to (1,3) or R to (2,2).\n\nNow, let's consider the food at (1,5). It has life span 7, so I have time, but it's close.\n\nAlso, (1,5) is free, not under body.\n\nFood positions: (6,3) will disappear, ignore; (1,5) at (1,5), and (4,3) at (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is currently under body but will be free after turn 59 if the snake moves.\n\nSince the segment moves away.\n\nIn general, when the snake moves, the tail position is vacated, but here (4,3) is not tail, but a body segment moving away vacates its cell.\n\nSo after any move, cells that were body but not moved to by another segment become free.\n\nSpecifically for (4,3), after turn 59, it will be free regardless of where I move, because the segment leaves it.\n\nSimilarly, the tail (5,3) was removed, but (5,3) didn't have food.\n\nAfter turn 58, tail is at (5,3).\n\nOn turn 59, when snake moves, tail is removed, so (5,3) is vacated, but no food there.\n\nFor (4,3), it is vacated after turn 59.\n\nThen food at (4,3) is available to eat from turn 60 onwards.\n\nLife span 10, so until turn 67 or so.\n\nNow, back to turn 59.\n\nFrom (1,2), if I move U to (1,3), I am closer to (1,5).\n\nIf I move R to (2,2), I am moving away from (1,5) but towards the center.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nLet's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid 1 to 6 in x and y.\n\nWalls at borders and obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake after turn 58: head (1,2), body: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)\n\n(3,3) and (4,3) and (5,3) are occupied.\n\nFree cells: for example, (1,3) free, (1,4), (1,5) has food, (1,6), (2,2) free, (2,3), etc.\n\nBut (4,6) obstacle, so (4,6) is wall.\n\nNow, the snake is long, 14 segments, after turn 58 move, 13 segments? After turn 58, we have 13 segments as above.\n\nAt turn 58 start, 14 segments, after move to (1,2) no eat, 13 segments.\n\nThen after turn 59, if no eat, 12 segments, etc.\n\nBut we can eat food to grow.\n\nNow, for long-term survival, I need space to move.\n\nCurrently, the snake occupies the bottom row and some above.\n\nLet me list all occupied cells after turn 58:\n\n- (1,2) head\n\n- (1,1)\n\n- (2,1)\n\n- (3,1)\n\n- (4,1)\n\n- (5,1)\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (6,2)\n\n- (5,2)\n\n- (4,2)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (4,3)\n\n- (5,3)\n\nSo occupied: rows y=1: x=1 to 6 all occupied? (1,1) to (6,1), yes all x=1-6 y=1.\n\ny=2: (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), and head is at (1,2), so (1,2) occupied, (2,2) free? Positions: (1,2) head, (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), etc., no (2,2), so (2,2) free.\n\nSimilarly, y=2: cells: (1,2) occupied, (2,2) free, (3,2) occupied, (4,2) occupied, (5,2) occupied, (6,2) occupied.\n\ny=3: (3,3) occupied, (4,3) occupied, (5,3) occupied, (1,3) free, (2,3) free, (6,3) has food but will disappear.\n\n(6,3) has food, but not occupied by snake? Snake has (6,1), (6,2), not (6,3), so (6,3) is free with food.\n\nBut life span short.\n\nSimilarly, y=4: (5,4) was tail but removed, so (5,4) free? After turn 58, positions up to (5,3), so y=4: all free except possible walls, but (4,6) obstacle, but y=4, (4,4) free, etc.\n\ny=4: cells (1,4) to (6,4) all free, since snake only up to y=3.\n\nSimilarly y=5, y=6 except (4,6) wall.\n\nNow, food at (1,5) and (4,3) soon free.\n\nI should go for (1,5) since it's positive food and I can reach it.\n\nFrom (1,2), if I move U to (1,3), then I can continue up to (1,4), then (1,5) to eat.\n\nBut at (1,5), is there any danger?\n\nAlso, after eating, snake grows, so I need to be careful not to trap myself.\n\nFirst, let's plan the path to (1,5).\n\nAt turn 58: move U to (1,2) — wait, turn 58 move to (1,2), so after turn 58, at (1,2).\n\nTurn 59: move U to (1,3)\n\nThen turn 60: from (1,3), can move U to (1,4)\n\nThen turn 61: from (1,4), move U to (1,5) to eat food.\n\nAt (1,5), I eat, so snake grows, new tail added.\n\nBut what about the direction? Current direction after turn 58 is U.\n\nAt turn 59, move U to (1,3), direction still U.\n\nTurn 60, move U to (1,4), U.\n\nTurn 61, move U to (1,5), eat food, so snake length increases.\n\nNow, after that, I am at (1,5), and I need to move somewhere.\n\nFrom (1,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut U to (1,6) - y=6 is border? y=7 is wall, so y=6 is playable, since walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is ok.\n\nL to (0,5) x=0 wall, invalid.\n\nR to (2,5)\n\nD to (1,4) but (1,4) is body? After moving to (1,5), let's see positions.\n\nBefore turn 61: after turn 60, head at (1,4), body: let's simulate.\n\nAfter turn 58: head (1,2), body (1,1), (2,1), ..., (5,3) as before.\n\nTurn 59: move U to (1,3)\n\nNew head: (1,3)\n\nNew body: old head (1,2), then old body except tail: so (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3)  // old positions except (5,3) removed, so 13 segments? After turn 58, 13 segments, after turn 59 move no eat, 12 segments.\n\nList: old positions: head (1,2), body (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) — 14 cells? No, after turn 58, we have 13 positions: head and 12 body, but body is 12 segments? Indices: 0 head, 1 to 12 body, 13 segments total? Let's count.\n\nAfter turn 58 positions: 1. (1,2) head, 2. (1,1), 3. (2,1), 4. (3,1), 5. (4,1), 6. (5,1), 7. (6,1), 8. (6,2), 9. (5,2), 10. (4,2), 11. (3,2), 12. (3,3), 13. (4,3) — that's 13 positions, with (4,3) as the last.\n\n(5,3) was tail and removed, so positions from (1,2) to (4,3), 13 cells.\n\nThen turn 59 move U to (1,3): new head (1,3), new body: old positions 1 to 12: (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3)  // old index 13 (4,3) not included, so new body has 12 segments? New positions: head (1,3), then body: old head (1,2), old body1 (1,1), old body2 (2,1), ..., up to old body11 (3,3), but old body12 was (4,3), which is not moved to, so not in new list.\n\nOld indices: 0: (1,2) head, 1: (1,1), 2: (2,1), 3: (3,1), 4: (4,1), 5: (5,1), 6: (6,1), 7: (6,2), 8: (5,2), 9: (4,2), 10: (3,2), 11: (3,3), 12: (4,3)\n\nAfter move to (1,3): new head (1,3), then new body: old 0: (1,2), old 1: (1,1), old 2: (2,1), old 3: (3,1), old 4: (4,1), old 5: (5,1), old 6: (6,1), old 7: (6,2), old 8: (5,2), old 9: (4,2), old 10: (3,2), old 11: (3,3)  // old 12 (4,3) is not included, so new positions have 12 segments: head and 11 body.\n\nYes.\n\nNow turn 60: move U to (1,4)\n\nNew head (1,4), new body: old head (1,3), then old body: (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2)  // (3,3) not included, so 12 segments? New body has old positions except the last one.\n\nAfter turn 60 move: new head (1,4), body: old head (1,3), old body1 (1,2), old body2 (1,1), ..., up to old body10 (3,2), but old body11 was (3,3), not included.\n\nList: new body: (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2)  // 12 segments including head? Head is (1,4), so positions: head (1,4), body (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) — 13 positions? Head and 12 body? Let's count: 1. head (1,4), 2. (1,3), 3. (1,2), 4. (1,1), 5. (2,1), 6. (3,1), 7. (4,1), 8. (5,1), 9. (6,1), 10. (6,2), 11. (5,2), 12. (4,2), 13. (3,2) — 13 segments, but (3,2) is the tail.\n\n(3,3) was lost.\n\nTurn 61: move U to (1,5) to eat food.\n\nNew head (1,5), since food is there, we eat, so no tail removal, snake grows.\n\nNew positions: head (1,5), then the previous body: (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2)  // same as before, but tail not removed, so 14 segments.\n\nNow, head at (1,5), direction U.\n\nFrom here, possible moves:\n\nU to (1,6) - y=6, valid, not wall.\n\nD to (1,4) - but (1,4) is now the first body segment, so collision. Also, D is reverse, cannot instantly reverse.\n\nL to (0,5) wall, invalid.\n\nR to (2,5) - should be free, not occupied.\n\nSo only possible moves are U to (1,6) or R to (2,5).\n\nIf I go U to (1,6), then from (1,6), I can only move R or L or D, but L wall, U to (1,7) wall invalid, D to (1,5) body, reverse invalid if current U, so only R to (2,6) or L but L invalid, so only R to (2,6).\n\nThen from (2,6), I can move U, D, L, R.\n\nU to (2,7) wall, D to (2,5), L to (1,6) body, R to (3,6), etc.\n\nBut y=6 is the top row, and there's an obstacle at (4,6), so I might get trapped.\n\nSpecifically, from (1,6), if I move R to (2,6), then from (2,6), I can move R to (3,6), then to (4,6) but (4,6) is obstacle, wall, so cannot move there.\n\nSo from (3,6), I can only move down or left, etc.\n\nBut the snake body is below, so I need to be careful not to collide.\n\nSince the snake is long, going to (1,6) might lead to a dead end.\n\nFor example, after being at (1,5), if I move U to (1,6), then to (2,6), then to (3,6), then from (3,6), I can move D to (3,5), but (3,5) might be free, but the body is at lower rows.\n\nBut let's see the free space.\n\nAfter eating at (1,5), positions include (1,1) to (1,5), and (2,1), etc., so row y=1 and y=2 partially occupied.\n\nMoving to (1,6) and right might be ok, but the area to the right might be tight.\n\nIf from (1,5) I move R to (2,5), that might be better.\n\n(2,5) is free, I can go to (2,5), then from there to (2,6) or (3,5), etc., more options.\n\nSo for long-term, moving R from (1,5) is better than U.\n\nBut at turn 61, when I reach (1,5), I have to choose.\n\nBut for now, back to turn 59.\n\nAt turn 59, from (1,2), I can move U or R.\n\nIf I move U, I can go to (1,5) in three moves, eating food on turn 61.\n\nIf I move R to (2,2), then I am not going directly to (1,5), but I can still go there later.\n\nBut (1,5) has life span 7, so I have until turn 64 to eat it, since after turn 64 it disappears.\n\nTurn 58: countdown=7\n\nAfter turn 58: countdown=6\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 64: countdown=0, gone for turn 65.\n\nSo I can eat it on any turn from 59 to 64.\n\nIf I go directly, I eat on turn 61.\n\nIf I go via (2,2), it might take longer.\n\nBut there's also the food at (4,3) which will be free after turn 59.\n\n(4,3) has life span 10, so until turn 67.\n\nNow, at turn 59, if I move R to (2,2), then I am closer to (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is at (4,3), I am at (2,2) after turn 59 move.\n\nDistance |4-2|=2, |3-2|=1, so I can reach in 3 moves or less.\n\nBut I need to plan the path.\n\nAlso, I should avoid the area where the snake body is.\n\nAfter turn 59, if I move to (2,2), positions: new head (2,2), body: old head (1,2), old body (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3)  // (4,3) vacated.\n\n(4,3) is free with food.\n\nFrom (2,2), I can move to (4,3) via, say, (3,2) but (3,2) is body? After move, positions include (3,2), so I cannot move to (3,2).\n\nAvailable moves from (2,2):\n\nCurrent direction after move to (2,2) is R (since from (1,2) to (2,2) is right).\n\nSo cannot move L (left), reverse.\n\nU to (2,3) - free?\n\nD to (2,1) - but (2,1) is body, collision.\n\nR to (3,2) - (3,2) is body, collision.\n\nL to (1,2) - body, collision, and reverse invalid.\n\nU to (2,3): is (2,3) free? After positions: head (2,2), body (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3)\n\n(2,3) not in list, so free.\n\nD to (2,1): occupied by body.\n\nR to (3,2): occupied.\n\nL to (1,2): occupied.\n\nSo only possible move from (2,2) is U to (2,3).\n\nThen from (2,3), I can move to (2,4), (3,3), etc.\n\n(3,3) is body, so I can go to (2,4) or (1,3) or (3,3) but (3,3) occupied.\n\nBut to reach (4,3), I need to go via (3,3) or (4,2) or (4,4), but (4,2) is occupied, (3,3) occupied.\n\nAfter turn 59, (4,3) is free, but I am at (2,2) or if I moved U, at (1,3).\n\nLet's compare the two options for turn 59.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (1,3) at turn 59.\n\nThen turn 60: from (1,3), can move U to (1,4) or R to (2,3) or D to (1,2) but D is reverse? Current direction U, so cannot move D.\n\nL to (0,3) wall.\n\nR to (2,3) - free.\n\nU to (1,4) - free.\n\nSo can move U or R.\n\nIf I go U to (1,4) on turn 60, then to (1,5) on turn 61 to eat.\n\nThen after that, as before, at (1,5) with direction U, can move U to (1,6) or R to (2,5).\n\nMoving U might lead to dead end, moving R is better.\n\nBut I can choose to move R at some point.\n\nAt turn 60 from (1,3), I could move R to (2,3) instead of U.\n\nBut to eat (1,5), I need to go up.\n\nSince (1,5) is close, I can eat it quickly.\n\nOption 2: at turn 59 move R to (2,2), then only move U to (2,3) at turn 60.\n\nThen from (2,3), I can go to (1,5) or to (4,3).\n\nBut (1,5) is at (1,5), from (2,3) I can move U to (2,4), then U to (2,5), then L to (1,5) to eat on turn 62 or something.\n\nOr from (2,3) move L to (1,3), then U to (1,4), then U to (1,5) on turn 62.\n\nSlower than option 1.\n\nFor (4,3), from (1,3) after turn 59, I can go to (2,3), then (3,3) but (3,3) is body, after turn 59 if I moved U to (1,3), positions: head (1,3), body (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3)  // (3,3) occupied.\n\n(4,3) free.\n\nFrom (1,3), I can move R to (2,3) at turn 60.\n\nThen from (2,3), can move U to (2,4), R to (3,3), but (3,3) occupied, so only U or D or L, but D to (2,2) body, L to (1,3) body, so only U to (2,4).\n\nThen from (2,4), to (2,5), (3,4), etc., to reach (4,3).\n\nFor example, turn 61 from (2,4) move R to (3,4), then turn 62 to (4,4), then turn 63 to (4,3) to eat.\n\nOr directly if possible, but from (3,4) to (4,3) not adjacent directly, need to move to (4,4) then (4,3) or (3,3) but (3,3) might be free later.\n\nBut it takes more turns.\n\nWhereas if I go for (1,5) first, I can eat it sooner.\n\nAlso, after eating (1,5), I grow, which might help with space, but the snake gets longer, which could be riskier in tight spaces.\n\nSince the grid is 6x6, with snake length 14, it's already long, so eating and growing might make it harder to man uver.\n\nBut I need to eat to score, but survival first.\n\nAnother thing: the tail reward danger.\n\nIn this case, no food near tail yet.\n\nBut at (4,3), when I eat it, I need to be careful if the tail is adjacent.\n\nBut tail is at (3,2) or something, far away.\n\nNow, for long-term, the area near (1,5) might be safer or not.\n\nLet's see the free space.\n\nThe grid has walls and obstacle.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), so the top row has a gap.\n\ny=6, x from 1 to 6 except (4,6) wall, so (1,6),(2,6),(3,6),(5,6),(6,6) free.\n\nBut the snake is mostly at bottom.\n\nAfter eating (1,5), if I move to (2,5), I can explore the right side.\n\nBut there's food at (4,3), which is on the way.\n\nPerhaps I should go for (4,3) first since it's closer after turn 59.\n\nAt turn 58, I am at (1,2).\n\nIf I move U to (1,3) at turn 59, I am at (1,3).\n\n(4,3) is at (4,3), distance |4-1|=3, same y, so I can move right.\n\nBut from (1,3), to go to (4,3), I need to move right three times, but path might be blocked.\n\nFor example, at (1,3), I can move R to (2,3) at turn 60, then to (3,3) at turn 61, but (3,3) is body? After turn 59, if I am at (1,3), positions include (3,3) as body, so on turn 60, (3,3) is occupied, I cannot move there.\n\nOn turn 61, when I move from (2,3) to (3,3), but (3,3) might be free by then.\n\nAfter turn 59: head at (1,3), body (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3)\n\nSo (3,3) is occupied.\n\nOn turn 60, if I move R to (2,3), new head (2,3), new body: old head (1,3), old body except last: (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2)  // (3,3) removed? Old body has (3,3) at index 12, but after move, it is not included, so (3,3) is vacated.\n\nAfter turn 60 move to (2,3): new head (2,3), body: old head (1,3), then old body1 to old body11: (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2)  // old body12 (3,3) not included, so (3,3) is free.\n\nThen at turn 61, from (2,3), I can move R to (3,3), which is now free, so I move to (3,3).\n\nThen from (3,3), I can move to (4,3) to eat food, since (4,3) has food and is free.\n\nTurn 61: move to (3,3), no eat yet.\n\nThen turn 62: from (3,3) move to (4,3) to eat.\n\nSo from turn 59 to turn 62, I can eat (4,3).\n\nSimilarly, for (1,5), if I go directly, eat on turn 61.\n\nBut (1,5) is farther in terms of turns if I am at (1,3) on turn 59.\n\nFrom (1,3) on turn 59, to (1,4) turn 60, to (1,5) turn 61 eat.\n\nSame as above for (4,3): turn 59 at (1,3), turn 60 to (2,3), turn 61 to (3,3), turn 62 to (4,3) eat.\n\nSo eating (1,5) on turn 61, (4,3) on turn 62.\n\nBut (1,5) has shorter life span relatively, but both have time.\n\nLife span of (1,5) is 7, so until turn 64, I can eat later.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should eat both, but I need to see the order.\n\nSince (4,3) is available sooner after being freed, and closer in path.\n\nAt turn 59, if I move U to (1,3), I can then go to (4,3) in three moves, eating on turn 62, or to (1,5) in two moves, eating on turn 61.\n\nBut (1,5) is at the edge, so after eating, I might be trapped, whereas (4,3) is more central, so eating (4,3) first might be better for long-term movement.\n\nAlso, after eating (4,3), I grow, and I can then go to (1,5).\n\nFrom (4,3), I can move to (1,5) via left and up.\n\nFor example, from (4,3) after eating, head at (4,3), then I can move L to (3,3), then to (2,3), (1,3), then U to (1,4), to (1,5).\n\nBut (1,5) might be eaten before turn 64.\n\nTurn 62 eat (4,3), then turn 63 to (3,3), turn 64 to (2,3), turn 65 to (1,3), turn 66 to (1,4), turn 67 to (1,5) eat, but turn 67 is too late, (1,5) disappears after turn 64, so not present on turn 65.\n\n(1,5) life span 7 at turn 58: after turn 64, countdown=0, gone for turn 65.\n\nSo last chance to eat is turn 64.\n\nIf I eat (4,3) on turn 62, I can reach (1,5) by turn 64.\n\nFrom (4,3) on turn 62, after eating, head at (4,3), direction from moving right or down? When I move to (4,3) from (3,3), direction R.\n\nThen from (4,3), can move L to (3,3) but (3,3) might be body or not.\n\nAfter eating at (4,3) on turn 62:\n\nBefore move, on turn 62, head at (3,3) after turn 61 move.\n\nLet's timeline.\n\nTurn 59: move U to (1,3)  // head (1,3)\n\nTurn 60: move R to (2,3)  // head (2,3)\n\nTurn 61: move R to (3,3)  // head (3,3)\n\nTurn 62: move R to (4,3) eat food  // head (4,3)\n\nAfter move, new head (4,3), body: old positions except tail removed? Since ate, no removal, so body includes old head (3,3), and previous body.\n\nPositions before turn 62 move: head (3,3), body (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2)  // after turn 61, positions: head (3,3), body (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2)  // 14 segments? Let's not digress.\n\nAfter eating at (4,3), head at (4,3), body includes (3,3), etc.\n\nFrom (4,3), I can move L to (3,3), but (3,3) is now body, collision.\n\nU to (4,4)\n\nD to (4,2) but (4,2) is body\n\nR to (5,3) might be free\n\nL invalid.\n\nSo possible U to (4,4) or R to (5,3).\n\nIf I want to go to (1,5), I need to go left.\n\nFrom (4,3), moving L to (3,3) is invalid, so I have to go U or R first.\n\nThen it takes more turns to reach (1,5).\n\nFor example, go U to (4,4), then L to (3,4), etc., but it might not reach by turn 64.\n\nTurn 62 at (4,3), turn 63 to (4,4), turn 64 to (3,4), but (1,5) is far.\n\nCannot reach (1,5) by turn 64 if I eat (4,3) on turn 62.\n\nTurn 64 is the last turn to eat (1,5).\n\nFrom turn 62 at (4,3), min Manhattan to (1,5) is |4-1|=3, |3-5|=2, dist 5, I have 2 turns: turn 63 and 64, can move 2 steps, not enough, so impossible to reach (1,5) if I am at (4,3) on turn 62.\n\nTherefore, if I go for (4,3) first, I miss (1,5).\n\nBut (1,5) is positive food, I should eat it.\n\nIf I go for (1,5) first, I can eat it on turn 61, then from (1,5) I can go to (4,3) later.\n\n(4,3) has life span 10, so until turn 67.\n\nAfter eating (1,5) on turn 61, at (1,5), I can move R to (2,5) on turn 62, then to (3,5) on turn 63, then to (4,5) on turn 64, then to (4,4) or (4,3) on turn 65 to eat (4,3).\n\nFrom (4,5) to (4,3) not direct, need to go to (4,4) then (4,3).\n\nTurn 65 to (4,4), turn 66 to (4,3) eat.\n\nLife span of (4,3): at turn 58 countdown 10, after turn 58:9, ..., after turn 66: countdown 10 - 9 =1? Start turn 58:10, after turn 58:9, after turn 59:8, ..., after turn 67:0, gone for turn 68.\n\nTurn 66: after turn 66, countdown=10 - (66-58) = 10-8=2? Let's calculate.\n\nTurn difference: from turn 58 to turn t, number of turns passed is t-58.\n\nCountdown at start of turn t: initial - (t - 58)\n\nAt start turn 58: countdown=10\n\nAfter turn 58: countdown=9 (start turn 59)\n\nAfter turn 59: countdown=8 (start turn 60)\n\n...\n\nAfter turn k: countdown = 10 - (k - 58) for k >=58\n\nAt start of turn t, countdown = 10 - (t - 58)\n\nFor t=58, 10 -0 =10\n\nt=59, 10-1=9\n\n...\n\nt=67, 10-9=1\n\nt=68, 10-10=0, but at start turn 68, countdown=0, food disappears before turn? At start of turn, if countdown >0, food present; after move, countdown decreases.\n\nIf countdown=1 at start of turn, after the turn, it becomes 0 and disappears.\n\nSo for (4,3), countdown=10 at turn 58 start.\n\nTurn 58 start: present, countdown=10\n\nAfter turn 58: countdown=9, present for turn 59\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 66: countdown=10 - (66-58) =10-8=2, so at start turn 67, countdown=2\n\nAfter turn 67: countdown=1, present for turn 68\n\nAfter turn 68: countdown=0, disappears, not present for turn 69.\n\nSo last chance to eat is turn 68.\n\nSimilarly, for (1,5), countdown=7 at turn 58.\n\nStart turn 64: countdown=7 - (64-58) =7-6=1\n\nAfter turn 64: countdown=0, disappears, not present for turn 65.\n\nSo can eat on turn 64.\n\nBack to plan.\n\nIf I go for (1,5) first:\n\nTurn 58: U to (1,2)  // must\n\nTurn 59: U to (1,3)\n\nTurn 60: U to (1,4)\n\nTurn 61: U to (1,5) eat\n\nThen turn 62: from (1,5), can move R to (2,5) (since U to (1,6) might be dead end, R better)\n\nTurn 63: from (2,5), can move U to (2,6) or R to (3,5) or D to (2,4), etc.\n\nTo go to (4,3), I can go to (3,5) then (4,5) then (4,4) then (4,3).\n\nTurn 62: to (2,5)\n\nTurn 63: to (3,5)\n\nTurn 64: to (4,5)\n\nTurn 65: to (4,4)\n\nTurn 66: to (4,3) eat\n\nAll within life span.\n\nIf at turn 62 from (1,5) I move U to (1,6), then turn 63 to (2,6), turn 64 to (3,6), then from (3,6) I can move D to (3,5), then to (4,5), etc., but similar.\n\nBut moving R to (2,5) is better to avoid top row.\n\nNow, for turn 59, if I move R to (2,2), then I can go to (4,3) faster.\n\nTurn 59: R to (2,2)\n\nThen only move U to (2,3) on turn 60\n\nThen from (2,3), can move U to (2,4) on turn 61\n\nThen to (2,5) on turn 62, or to (3,3) but (3,3) is free after turn 60? After turn 59 move to (2,2), positions: head (2,2), body (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3)  // (4,3) vacated.\n\nOn turn 60, move U to (2,3): new head (2,3), body (2,2), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2)  // (3,3) removed, so (3,3) free.\n\nThen on turn 61, from (2,3), can move R to (3,3) which is free, so to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 62 to (4,3) eat.\n\nSo eat (4,3) on turn 62.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (1,5).\n\nFrom (4,3) on turn 62, after eating, head at (4,3), can move U to (4,4) or R to (5,3), etc.\n\nTo (1,5): min dist 5, with turns until turn 64 to eat (1,5).\n\nTurn 62 at (4,3), turn 63 to (4,4), turn 64 to (4,5) or (3,4), but to (1,5) not reachable in 2 moves, dist 5, impossible.\n\nSo I would miss (1,5).\n\nTherefore, to eat both, I must eat (1,5) first, then (4,3).\n\nFor turn 59, I should move U to (1,3) to go towards (1,5).\n\nThen proceed as above.\n\nAt turn 59, moving U also allows me to go to (4,3) later, but moving R might get me to (4,3) faster but miss (1,5).\n\nSince (1,5) is only available until turn 64 and I can eat it early, better to eat it.\n\nSo for turn 59, move U to (1,3).\n\nThen turn 60 move U to (1,4)\n\nTurn 61 move U to (1,5) eat\n\nThen turn 62 move R to (2,5)  // from (1,5), move R to (2,5)\n\nThen turn 63 move R to (3,5)  // to (3,5)\n\nThen turn 64 move R to (4,5)  // to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 65 move D to (4,4) or directly to (4,3)? From (4,5) to (4,4) then to (4,3).\n\nBut at (4,3) food, so on turn 66 move to (4,3) eat.\n\nBut on turn 65 at (4,5), I can move D to (4,4), then turn 66 to (4,3) eat.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the format says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output actions starting from turn t1.\n\nThe answer should be like:\n\nTurn 58: U\n\nTurn 59: U\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: U  // to (1,5) eat\n\nTurn 62: R  // to (2,5)\n\nBut I need to specify for 5 turns or more? The boxed format shows multiple turns.\n\n\"Answer Format\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn \\(t_1\\): action on turn t_1\nTurn \\(t_1 + 1\\): action on turn t_1 + 1\n...\n}\"\n\nAnd \"think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should output at least 5 turns.\n\nCurrent t1=58, so up to turn 62 or more.\n\nIn my plan, turn 62 is R to (2,5).\n\nBut let's confirm if all moves are valid.\n\nAlso, at turn 61, moving U to (1,5), direction U, then turn 62 move R to (2,5), which is not reverse, so ok.\n\nFrom (2,5), on turn 63, move R to (3,5), possible.\n\nBut in the output, I can output up to turn 62 or further.\n\nSince the food at (4,3) is later, I can output the immediate moves.\n\nFor the first few turns, I have a plan.\n\nBut at turn 59, if I move U, is there any risk?\n\nFrom (1,3), moving U to (1,4) is fine.\n\nThen to (1,5).\n\nAfter that, moving R to (2,5) is safe.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut to think 5 turns ahead: turns 58 to 62.\n\nTurn 58: U\n\nTurn 59: U\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: U  // to (1,5)\n\nTurn 62: R  // to (2,5)\n\nNow, for turn 63, I can move R to (3,5), but not necessary to output.\n\nThe format might expect only the actions, but for the sequence.\n\nSince I have to output multiple, I can do 5 turns.\n\nBut let's see if I can include the eat.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (4,6), but I am not going there soon.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nBut at turn 59, if I move R, I might not get (1,5), but since I can, better to eat it.\n\nSo I'll go with U for turn 59.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 58: U\n\nTurn 59: U\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: U\n\nTurn 62: R\n\nBut for turn 62, it's after eating, but in the sequence.\n\nPerhaps I should output 5 actions.\n\nSince thinking ahead, but output for t1 to t1+4 or something.\n\nThe format shows \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to specify the turns.\n\nAlso, in the state, head direction is L, but after move, it changes.\n\nBut for the answer, just the actions.\n\nSo for the boxed.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned at least 5 turns ahead. The key considerations are:\n\n- **Current Position and Constraints**: The snake head is at (1,1) at turn 58, moving left (L). However, moving left to (0,1) is invalid due to the wall, and moving right to (2,1) causes a body collision. Moving down to (1,0) is also a wall collision. Thus, the only valid move at turn 58 is up (U) to (1,2).\n- **Food Availability**: \n  - Food at (6,3) has a life span of 2 and will disappear after turn 59. It is unreachable by turn 59 from (1,2), so it is ignored.\n  - Food at (1,5) has a life span of 7 (last chance to eat on turn 64) and is positive (+1, grows snake). It is the closest accessible food and can be reached by moving up consistently.\n  - Food at (4,3) has a life span of 10 (last chance to eat on turn 68) and is currently under the snake body. It will become free after turn 59 and can be eaten later after consuming (1,5) first to avoid missing it due to the shorter life span.\n- **Movement Strategy**: \n  - Move up to (1,2) at turn 58 (only option).\n  - Continue up to (1,3) at turn 59 to position for reaching (1,5).\n  - Move up to (1,4) at turn 60.\n  - Move up to (1,5) at turn 61 to eat the food and grow the snake.\n  - After eating, at (1,5), move right to (2,5) at turn 62 to avoid the risky top edge (y=6) and head towards the central area for better long-term mobility. This also starts the path toward (4,3).\n- **Risk Avoidance**: \n  - Moving to (1,6) or higher risks dead ends near walls and the obstacle at (4,6), so turning right at (1,5) is safer.\n  - The path to (4,3) is planned after turn 62 (e.g., via (3,5) and (4,5) by turn 65-66) within its life span, ensuring both foods are eaten without collision risks.\n  - Tail reward danger is not a concern here, as no food is adjacent to the tail during these moves.\n\n**Planned Actions for Turns 58 to 62 (5 turns ahead):**\n\n- Turn 58: Move U (up) to (1,2) – only valid move.\n- Turn 59: Move U (up) to (1,3) – positions for (1,5) and avoids body collisions.\n- Turn 60: Move U (up) to (1,4) – continues path to (1,5).\n- Turn 61: Move U (up) to (1,5) – eat positive food, grow snake.\n- Turn 62: Move R (right) to (2,5) – avoids top-edge dead end and starts path to (4,3).\n\nThis sequence eats (1,5) quickly, scores +1, and sets up for eating (4,3) later. Beyond turn 62, the snake can move to (3,5) on turn 63, (4,5) on turn 64, and (4,4) on turn 65 to reach (4,3) by turn 66, all within its life span.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 58: U \\\\\nTurn 59: U \\\\\nTurn 60: U \\\\\nTurn 61: U \\\\\nTurn 62: R\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 59, and I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid since the borders are x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. Walls are at the borders and one internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (1,2), and the body segments follow: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3). That's 14 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n\nHead direction is Up, meaning it's moving upwards. Last move was U, so from (1,1) to (1,2), I assume, since positions are head first.\n\nNow, food:\n\n- (6,3) with value 1 and life span 1. So it disappears after this turn if not eaten. Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 59, life span is 1, meaning if not eaten now, it vanishes.\n\n- (1,5) with value 1 and life span 6. Value 1 is positive food, I think? It says \"value\" and from core rules, positive food has +1, negative has -1. Here both are listed as value 1, but for (4,3) it's also value 1. Let me check the food list:\n\nFood: (6,3,1,1) — I think this means (x,y, value, life_span) so (6,3) value=1, life_span=1\n\nSimilarly, (1,5,6,1) — (1,5) value=6? No, it says \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span\", and in the example it's (x,y), value, life_span. But for (1,5,6,1), it might be (x,y, value, life_span) = (1,5, value=6, life_span=1)? That doesn't make sense because values should be +1 or -1 for food, I think? No, core rules say positive food +1, negative food -1, but here the values are given, so (1,5) has value 6? That can't be right.\n\nLook back: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - (6, 3, 1, 1) - (1, 5, 6, 1) - (4, 3, 9, 1)\"\n\nFormat might be (x, y, value, life_span). But (6,3,1,1) could be x=6,y=3, value=1, life_span=1\n\n(1,5,6,1) x=1,y=5, value=6, life_span=1? But value 6? That seems odd, as per rules, food should be +1 or -1, but here it's specified with values.\n\nPerhaps I misread the core rules. Core rules say: \"Positive Food: Reward Value = +1\", \"Negative Food: Penalty Value = -1\", but in the state, it's given with values, so for (1,5,6,1), value=6 might mean it's positive with a reward of 6? But the rules only mention +1 and -1, but here values are different. Let me read carefully.\n\nIn the state input: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" so it's (x,y), value, life_span.\n\nFor (1,5,6,1), it's likely value=6, life_span=1.\n\nBut core rules say positive food is +1, but it doesn't say it can't be other values? The core rules are general, but in this specific state, values are given as 1,6,9? (6,3,1,1) value=1, (1,5,6,1) value=6, (4,3,9,1) value=9.\n\n(4,3,9,1) is listed, but (4,3) is also a snake position? Snake positions include (4,3), which is the tail or something.\n\nSnake positions: [(1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)]\n\nSo (4,3) is occupied by the snake, and there's food at (4,3) with value 9 and life span 9? But food can spawn under the snake's body, as per special cases.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) has food, and (1,5) has food.\n\nFor (4,3), since it's under the snake, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nNow, values: (6,3) value=1, life_span=1; (1,5) value=6, life_span=6? life_span=1 for all? (1,5,6,1) so value=6, life_span=1; (4,3,9,1) value=9, life_span=1.\n\nLife span 1 for all, meaning all food disappears after this turn if not eaten.\n\nLife span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 59, life_span=1 means if not eaten on this turn, it vanishes.\n\nFor (1,5) life_span=6? No, (1,5,6,1) I think it's value=6, life_span=1.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3,9,1) value=9, life_span=1.\n\nAnd (6,3,1,1) value=1, life_span=1.\n\nSo all food has life_span=1, so they must be eaten this turn or lost.\n\nBut (1,5) has life_span=6, but it says life_span=1 for that? (1,5,6,1) - value=6, life_span=1.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, snake head is at (1,2), direction Up.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse instantly. Since head direction is U, last move was up, so cannot move down (D) next, because reverse is not allowed.\n\nNo instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nCurrent direction is U, so cannot move D on this turn.\n\nSo possible actions: U, L, R. (Up, Left, Right)\n\nNow, let's see what each move does.\n\nFirst, if move U: from (1,2) to (1,3)\n\nThen, snake moves, tail moves, so the new head is (1,3), and tail (5,3) is removed? Snake positions: head was (1,2), then (1,1), etc., tail is (5,3).\n\nWhen snake moves, if no food eaten, tail is removed, head moves to new position.\n\nBut if food eaten, tail not removed, so snake grows.\n\nFirst, check for food at new head position.\n\nIf move U to (1,3): is there food? Food positions: (6,3), (1,5), (4,3). (1,3) has no food, so no eat, snake moves, tail removed.\n\nNew positions: head (1,3), then body: (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3) — (5,3) was tail, removed, so positions: from head to tail: (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3) — that's 14 segments, same as before.\n\n(4,3) is still there, but it has food under it? But not eaten.\n\nNow, if move L: from (1,2) to (0,2). But x=0 is wall, border cells x=0 is wall, so move L to (0,2) is wall collision, death. So cannot move L.\n\nIf move R: from (1,2) to (2,2). Is (2,2) occupied? Snake positions: let's list all: (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)\n\n(2,2) is not in the list, so empty? Also, not a wall except borders and (4,6), so (2,2) is free.\n\nMove R to (2,2): no food there, so snake moves, tail removed.\n\nNew head (2,2), body: (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3) — tail (5,3) removed.\n\nNow, move D: but cannot, because reverse, current direction U, move D is opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo only possible safe moves: U or R. Move L to wall, death. Move D not allowed.\n\nU to (1,3) or R to (2,2).\n\nBut there is food that must be eaten this turn or lost: (6,3), (1,5), (4,3) all with life_span=1.\n\n(4,3) is currently occupied by snake body, so to eat it, the head must move to (4,3) and the body must move away. But currently, (4,3) is part of the snake, so if head moves there, it would collide with body, unless the body moves away first.\n\nPer special cases: food under body can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nSo for (4,3), it can be eaten only if in some future turn, the snake moves such that (4,3) is vacated and then head moves to it.\n\nBut life_span=1, so only this turn it can be eaten, but since it's under body, and head is not adjacent, it can't be eaten this turn. Because to eat, head must move to it when it's free, but it's occupied now, so this turn, it can't be eaten. Life_span decreases, so after this turn, it disappears if not eaten.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) is free, I think? Positions: (6,3) not in snake positions, and not wall, so free.\n\n(1,5) free.\n\nBut head at (1,2), to reach (6,3) in one move? Not possible, only adjacent moves.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) is at (1,5), which is up from (1,2), but (1,2) to (1,3) to (1,4) to (1,5), three moves away.\n\n(6,3) is far.\n\n(4,3) is occupied, can't eat now.\n\nSo for this turn, none of the food can be eaten because:\n\n- (6,3) is at (6,3), head at (1,2), not adjacent.\n\n- (1,5) at (1,5), not adjacent to (1,2).\n\n- (4,3) is occupied by snake, so head can't move there without collision.\n\nTherefore, no food can be eaten this turn, so all food will disappear after this turn since life_span=1.\n\nLife_span=1, decreases this turn, so if not eaten on turn 59, they vanish.\n\nSo on this turn, I cannot eat any food, so I should just move safely.\n\nPossible moves: U or R.\n\nMove U to (1,3): what is at (1,3)? Empty, I think. Snake positions don't have (1,3), walls no, so safe.\n\nMove R to (2,2): also empty, safe.\n\nBut need to think ahead for future turns.\n\nAlso, after moving, the snake will be shorter if no food eaten, but since no food eaten, tail is removed, so snake length decreases by one? No.\n\nWhen no food eaten, snake moves, head to new position, tail removed, so length same? No, length decreases only if negative food, but here no food, so length unchanged? Core rules: when eating positive food, length +1, negative food length unchanged, no food, length unchanged? When snake moves without eating, the tail is removed, so the number of segments decreases by one, meaning length decreases.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nCore rules: \"Positive Food: Reward Value = +1 | Length of snake +1\"\n\n\"Negative Food: Penalty Value = -1 | Length of snake unchanged\"\n\nBut when no food is eaten, what happens? The snake moves forward, so the head moves to a new cell, and the tail cell is vacated, so the snake shortens? No.\n\nStandard snake: when no food eaten, snake moves to new cell, tail is removed, so the number of segments remains the same, but the snake effectively moves forward.\n\nFor example, from positions [H, B1, B2, ..., T], move to new head, then positions [new H, H, B1, B2, ... up to before T], so T is removed, so same number of segments.\n\nIn this case, snake has 14 segments. After move without eating, still 14 segments? No: positions list has 14 cells.\n\nAfter move, head moves to new position, and the last position (tail) is removed, so the new positions list has the same number of elements, but the tail is different.\n\nFor example, from [A,B,C,D], if move to E, no eat, new positions [E,A,B,C], D removed.\n\nSo length same.\n\nIf eat food, new positions [E,A,B,C,D], so length +1.\n\nSimilarly, if negative food, length unchanged, but value penalty.\n\nIn this case, no food eaten, so after move, snake still has 14 segments, but the tail has moved.\n\nIn my earlier, after U to (1,3), positions: (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), ..., up to (4,3), and (5,3) removed.\n\n(5,3) was the tail, so new tail is (4,3) or something. Original positions: index 0: (1,2) head, 1:(1,1), 2:(2,1), 3:(3,1), 4:(4,1), 5:(5,1), 6:(6,1), 7:(6,2), 8:(5,2), 9:(4,2), 10:(3,2), 11:(3,3), 12:(4,3), 13:(5,3) tail.\n\nAfter move U, head to (1,3), so new positions: head (1,3), then the previous head and body except tail: so (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3) — and (5,3) removed. So now tail is (4,3), and (4,3) is now the last segment.\n\nSimilarly for move R to (2,2): new positions (2,2), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3) — tail (5,3) removed, so tail is (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is still part of the body.\n\nBut (4,3) has food under it, but since not eaten, and life_span=1, after this turn, the food disappears.\n\nSimilarly for other food.\n\nSo for turn 59, I need to choose between U and R.\n\nNow, think ahead 5+ turns.\n\nFirst, after this move, the food will be gone, so I need to consider the board state.\n\nAlso, walls and obstacles.\n\nGrid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.\n\nAlso internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake head at (1,2), moving U or R.\n\nIf I move U to (1,3), head at (1,3), direction U.\n\nThen from there, possible moves: U, L, R (cannot D, reverse).\n\n(1,3) U to (1,4): is it free? Not wall, not occupied? After move, positions have (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), etc., (1,4) not in positions, so free? But need to check if wall: y=4, x=1, borders not, so free.\n\nSimilarly, L to (0,3): x=0 wall, death.\n\nR to (2,3): free? Not in positions, not wall.\n\nSo from (1,3), can go U to (1,4) or R to (2,3).\n\nIf I move R to (2,2) at turn 59, head at (2,2), direction R (since moved right).\n\nThen from (2,2), possible moves: U, D, R (cannot L, reverse).\n\nU to (2,3), D to (2,1), R to (3,2).\n\nNow, (2,1) is occupied? After move to (2,2), positions: (2,2), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), ... so (2,1) is a body segment, so if move D to (2,1), collision with body, death.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) free? Not in positions, not wall.\n\n(3,2) free? Positions have (3,2) as segment? After move, positions: head (2,2), then (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3)\n\n(3,2) is at index 11, so it's a body segment. If move R to (3,2), which is occupied, collision.\n\nSo from (2,2), possible moves:\n\nU to (2,3): not occupied, not wall, safe.\n\nD to (2,1): occupied by body, collision, death.\n\nR to (3,2): occupied by body, collision, death.\n\nL to (1,2): but L is left, current direction is R (after moving R), so reverse would be L, but no instant reverse, so cannot move L to (1,2) because opposite direction.\n\nCurrent direction after move R is R, so cannot move L (opposite).\n\nCan move U, D, or R.\n\nBut D and R lead to collision, only U to (2,3) is safe.\n\nSo if I move R at turn 59 to (2,2), then at turn 60, I must move U to (2,3), no choice, otherwise death.\n\nThen from (2,3), direction U.\n\nThen possible moves U, L, R (cannot D).\n\nU to (2,4), L to (1,3), R to (3,3).\n\n(1,3) might be occupied? After turn 59 move R to (2,2), positions: as above, (2,2), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3)\n\nThen turn 60 move U to (2,3), new head (2,3), new positions: (2,3), (2,2), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) — tail (4,3) removed? Tail was (4,3), removed, so new tail is (3,3)? Positions: head (2,3), then (2,2), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) — and (4,3) removed, so tail is (3,3).\n\n(3,3) is tail.\n\nNow at (2,3), can move U to (2,4), L to (1,3), R to (3,3).\n\n(1,3): not occupied, not wall.\n\n(2,4): not occupied, not wall.\n\n(3,3): is occupied? (3,3) is the tail now? In positions, (3,3) is the last segment, tail.\n\nBut when moving, if head moves to (3,3), which is the current tail, but since the tail will move when the snake moves, it might be safe, as per rules: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving to tail is safe, because tail moves away.\n\nSo (3,3) is tail, so moving R to (3,3) is safe, and if no food, tail moves, so new head (3,3), and new positions, etc.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) and (2,4) are free.\n\nSo from (2,3), all moves possible except D.\n\nBut need to see long-term.\n\nFirst, back to turn 59 choice.\n\nIf I choose U at turn 59: to (1,3)\n\nThen head at (1,3), direction U.\n\nThen turn 60, possible moves: U to (1,4), L to (0,3) wall, not possible, R to (2,3).\n\nCannot D reverse.\n\nSo only U or R.\n\n(1,4) free? Not wall, not occupied yet.\n\n(2,3) free? After turn 59 move U to (1,3), positions: (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3) — tail (4,3)\n\n(2,3) not in positions, so free.\n\nSo at turn 60, can go U to (1,4) or R to (2,3).\n\nIf go U to (1,4), then from (1,4), can go U to (1,5) or L or R, but L to (0,4) wall, R to (2,4), etc.\n\n(1,5) has food? But food at (1,5) has life_span=1, and on turn 59 not eaten, so after turn 59, it disappears, since life_span=1 and not eaten on turn 59. So on turn 60, no food at (1,5).\n\nSimilarly, all food gone.\n\nSo the board is empty after turn 59.\n\nI need to survive and look for future food, but no food positions given, so probably new food will spawn later, but I don't know. The state only has current food, but for thinking ahead, I need to assume no food or something, but to maximize score, I should explore areas where food might appear, but since not specified, I should avoid dead ends and stay safe.\n\nAlso, the snake is long, 14 segments, so it takes space.\n\nNow, let's map the current snake positions to see the shape.\n\nList all positions:\n\nHead: (1,2)\n\nThen: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) — this is bottom row y=1, x=1 to 6\n\nThen (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) — so at y=2, x=6 to x=3\n\nThen (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) — y=3, x=3,4,5\n\nAnd (4,3) is position, but also food under it, but not eaten.\n\nThe snake is mostly on the bottom-left to right, then up a bit.\n\nNow, internal wall at (4,6), but not relevant yet.\n\nAfter turn 59, if I move U to (1,3), head at (1,3), and the body is from (1,2) down to (1,1), right to (6,1), up to (6,2), left to (3,2), then up to (3,3), right to (5,3) but tail removed? After move U, tail (5,3) removed, so positions: (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3)\n\nSo the snake occupies: (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), and the row y=1 from x=2 to6, then (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3)\n\n(4,3) is the tail now.\n\nFree spaces: for example, top area, but with internal wall.\n\nIf I move R to (2,2) at turn 59, then as before, at turn 60 must move U to (2,3), then head at (2,3), with positions: (2,3), (2,2), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) — tail (3,3)\n\nNow, compare the two choices.\n\nFirst, moving U at turn 59: to (1,3)\n\nThen at turn 60, I can choose U to (1,4) or R to (2,3).\n\nIf I go to (1,4), then from (1,4), I can go U to (1,5), but y=5, x=1, not wall, free. Or R to (2,4), etc.\n\nBut moving up might lead to top area.\n\nIf from (1,3) I go R to (2,3), then at (2,3), I can go U, L, R.\n\nL to (1,3) but occupied? Positions have (1,3) as previous head, so body, cannot move to (1,3).\n\nAt (2,3), positions: (2,3) head, then (1,3), (1,2), etc., so (1,3) is body, so moving L to (1,3) would be collision.\n\nSimilarly, U to (2,4), R to (3,3).\n\n(3,3) is tail? In this case, after turn 59 U to (1,3), positions include (3,3) and (4,3), (3,3) is not tail, tail is (4,3).\n\nAfter move to (1,3), positions: (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3) — so (3,3) is second last, (4,3) tail.\n\nAt turn 60, if move R to (2,3), new head (2,3), new positions: (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) — tail (4,3) removed, so tail is (3,3).\n\nNow at (2,3), can move U to (2,4), L to (1,3) but (1,3) is now body segment, occupied, collision if move there.\n\nR to (3,3) which is tail, so safe.\n\nD to (2,2) but reverse, current direction after moving to (2,3) is R? From (1,3) to (2,3) is right, so direction R, so cannot move L or D? D is down, not opposite, opposite would be L.\n\nDirections: U up, D down, L left, R right.\n\nCurrent direction: if moved from (1,3) to (2,3), that is right, so direction R.\n\nThen possible moves: U (up), D (down), R (right) — cannot L (left, opposite).\n\nNow, U to (2,4): free.\n\nD to (2,2): (2,2) is not occupied? In positions, after move, positions are (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), ..., (3,2), (3,3), so (2,2) not in list, so free? (2,2) is not a position, so empty.\n\nBut is it wall? No, x=2,y=2 not border, not obstacle.\n\nSo D to (2,2) possible and safe.\n\nR to (3,3): (3,3) is tail, so safe.\n\nSo from (2,3), can go U, D, or R.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 60 I go U to (1,4) from (1,3), etc.\n\nBut let's think about the risk.\n\nIf at turn 59 I move R to (2,2), then at turn 60 I must move U to (2,3), as earlier, because other moves cause death.\n\nThen at (2,3), I can choose to go U, D, or R.\n\nBut moving to (2,3) from (2,2) is up, so direction U.\n\nThen from (2,3), direction U, so can move U, L, R (cannot D reverse).\n\nU to (2,4), L to (1,3), R to (3,3).\n\n(1,3): after positions, (2,3) head, (2,2), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), ..., (3,3) tail, so (1,3) not occupied, free.\n\n(2,4) free.\n\n(3,3) tail, safe.\n\nSo all possible.\n\nBut in this path, by moving R at turn 59, I am forced to go to (2,3) at turn 60, which is fine.\n\nBut in the U move at turn 59, I have more flexibility at turn 60.\n\nHowever, there is a potential issue with the food at (4,3).\n\nBut it disappears after this turn.\n\nAnother thing: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut here, no food to eat now, and (4,3) has food but not eaten, so no issue.\n\nFor long-term survival, I should avoid boxing myself in.\n\nThe grid has 8x8=64 cells, snake 14 segments, so 50 free cells, but with walls.\n\nBorders occupied, so playable area 6x6=36? x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so columns 1 to 6, similarly y=0 and y=7 walls, so rows 1 to 6.\n\nx=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 but x=0 and x=7 walls, so cells with x=1 to6, y=1 to6 are playable, 6x6=36 cells.\n\nBut internal obstacle at (4,6), which is within, so one cell occupied, so 35 free cells minus snake.\n\nSnake 14 segments, so free cells: 35 - 14 = 21, but the snake occupies 14, walls occupy borders and (4,6), but borders are many cells.\n\nTotal cells: 8x8=64.\n\nWall cells: all x=0, all x=7, all y=0, all y=7, but corners counted once.\n\nx=0: 8 cells, x=7: 8 cells, y=0: but y=0, x=0 and x=7 already counted, so y=0 x=1 to6: 6 cells, similarly y=7 x=1 to6: 6 cells.\n\nInternal obstacle (4,6) one cell.\n\nSo total wall cells: x=0:8, x=7:8, y=0: only x=1 to6 (since x=0 and x=7 done), so 6, y=7: x=1 to6, 6 cells, internal 1 cell. Total wall: 8+8+6+6+1 = 29? 8+8=16, +6=22, +6=28, +1=29 walls.\n\nThen free cells: 64 - 29 = 35, but snake occupies 14, so empty cells: 35 - 14 = 21.\n\nYes.\n\nAfter move, snake still 14, empty 21.\n\nNow, the snake is concentrated in the bottom-left area.\n\nFor example, with head at (1,2), if I move U to (1,3), the snake is near (1,1) to (6,1), etc.\n\nIf I move R to (2,2), head at (2,2), then to (2,3), it moves to row y=3.\n\nThe top area, like y=4,5,6, has less snake, so might be good to go there for potential food.\n\nBut no food now.\n\nAlso, internal wall at (4,6), which is on row y=6.\n\nTo maximize survival, I should move towards open areas.\n\nFor example, from (1,2), moving U to (1,3) then U to (1,4) etc. can go up to y=6, but at (4,6) wall.\n\nMoving R to (2,2) then U to (2,3) then to (2,4) etc.\n\nBut let's see if there are dead ends.\n\nFor instance, if I go to (1,3) and then keep going up, to (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), but at (1,6), y=6, and x=1, then I can go R to (2,6) or D, but D might be down.\n\nBut (1,6) is corner, might be risky.\n\nSimilarly, the area around (3,3) to (5,3) has body.\n\nPerhaps moving R at turn 59 is better because it brings the head to (2,2), then to (2,3), which is more central, whereas (1,3) is left edge.\n\nAlso, from (2,3), I can go to (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), or right to (3,3), etc.\n\n(3,3) might be tail or body.\n\nBut let's plan 5 turns.\n\nFirst, option 1: move U at t59 to (1,3)\n\nThen at t60, I need to choose, say I go U to (1,4) for exploration.\n\nThen head at (1,4), direction U.\n\nThen t61, can go U to (1,5), L to (0,4) wall, R to (2,4).

After positions: t59 R to (2,2), positions: (2,2), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3) but tail (4,3) removed at t59? At t59 move to (2,2), new positions: head (2,2), then (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3) — tail (4,3)\n\nt60 move U to (2,3), new head (2,3), new positions: (2,3), (2,2), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) — tail (4,3) removed, so tail (3,3)\n\nAt t61 from (2,3), direction U, can go U to (2,4), L to (1,3), R to (3,3)\n\n(1,3): not occupied, free\n\n(2,4): free\n\n(3,3): is tail, safe\n\nAll possible.\n\nNow, (3,3) is tail, so moving to it is safe, and since it's tail, it will move.\n\nBut after moving to (3,3), the tail was (3,3), so it moves, new head (3,3), new positions depending on move.\n\nBut in terms of space, moving to (2,4) or (1,3) might be better to go up.\n\n(1,3) is left, (2,4) up, (3,3) right but to tail.\n\nMoving to tail is safe but might not be progress.\n\nFor survival, I should avoid the body and go to open areas.\n\nThe bottom is crowded, top is more empty.\n\nFor example, cells like (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), etc., are free.\n\nAlso, y=6 has the obstacle at (4,6), so need to avoid that.\n\nBack to t59 choice.\n\nIf I move U to (1,3) at t59, I can then at t60 move U to (1,4), then to (1,5), etc., but that leads to the top-left corner, which might be a dead end if not careful.\n\nFrom (1,3), I can move R to (2,3) at t60, then to (2,4) or (3,3).\n\n(3,3) is tail, so moving to (3,3) at t61 from (2,3) would be R to (3,3).\n\nThen new head (3,3), and since it was tail, the new positions: head (3,3), then (2,3), (2,2), (1,2), etc., and tail moves, so the previous tail (3,3) is now head, and the segment before that was (3,2), which becomes new tail or something.\n\nPositions before move: at (2,3), positions (2,3), (2,2), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) — tail (3,3)\n\nMove R to (3,3), new head (3,3), and since no food, tail is removed. Tail was (3,3), but it's the head now, so the last segment is removed, which is (3,2)? The positions list: indices 0: (2,3) head, 1: (2,2), 2: (1,2), 3: (1,1), 4: (2,1), 5: (3,1), 6: (4,1), 7: (5,1), 8: (6,1), 9: (6,2), 10: (5,2), 11: (4,2), 12: (3,2), 13: (3,3) tail\n\nWhen move to (3,3), new head (3,3), then the previous positions except tail, so new positions: (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) — and tail (3,3) is removed, but it's the new head, so the last segment (3,2) is now tail.\n\nSo snake is at (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), ..., (3,2)\n\n(3,2) is tail.\n\nThen from (3,3), I can move to other places.\n\nBut it's a bit messy.\n\nPerhaps for simplicity, at t59, moving U to (1,3) allows me to go up to less crowded area, while moving R to (2,2) forces me to (2,3) and then I can go up.\n\nIn both cases, I can reach the top area.\n\nBut moving U at t59 might be safer because from (1,3), I can go U or R, while from (2,2) after R move, I have only one choice U at t60.\n\nSo moving U at t59 gives more options.\n\nAlso, the head is at (1,2), moving L is wall, so only U or R, U is up, which is towards the open area.\n\nR is right, but the right has body at (2,1), etc.\n\nIn terms of immediate risk, both U and R are safe for t59.\n\nBut for long-term, moving U might be better to explore the top.\n\nMoreover, there was food at (1,5) but it's gone, so no issue.\n\nSo I think move U at t59.\n\nThen for t60, from (1,3), I can move U to (1,4) to continue up.\n\nThen t61 to (1,5), t62 to (1,6), t63 to (2,6), etc.\n\nBut at (1,6), I can only go R to (2,6), so it's a bit constrained.\n\nFrom (1,3), at t60 move R to (2,3), then from (2,3) move U to (2,4), etc.\n\nBut since I need to output only the action for t59, and then think ahead for the answer format.\n\nThe answer should be for turns starting from t59, but only one action for t59, I think, or multiple?\n\nAnswer format: \"Turn t1: action on turn t1 Turn t1+1: action on turn t1+1 ...\"\n\nBut it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but output the actions for the turns, starting from current.\n\nFor this response, since it's turn t1=59, I need to output actions for turn 59, 60, 61, etc., for 5 turns or so.\n\nBut I don't know the future state, so I need to plan a sequence based on current state.\n\nBut new food may spawn, but I have to assume no new food for now, or consider possibilities.\n\nTo be safe, I can plan a path for the next few moves.\n\nSince the grid is small, I can simulate.\n\nBut let's decide on t59 action.\n\nI think moving U is better.\n\nSo for turn 59, action U.\n\nThen for turn 60, from (1,3), I should move U to (1,4) to go up.\n\nThen turn 61 from (1,4) to (1,5), turn 62 to (1,6), turn 63 to (2,6), etc.\n\nBut at (1,6), only R to (2,6), which is fine.\n\nFrom (1,4), I could move R to (2,4), but that might be towards the body.\n\nFor now, let's output U for t59.\n\nBut let's confirm the food.\n\nAt t59, no food can be eaten, so no choice.\n\nAlso, for the food at (4,3), since it's under body and life_span=1, it disappears after this turn, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo I think U is fine.\n\nPerhaps moving R is also fine, but it forces a specific path.\n\nSo I'll go with U for t59.\n\nThen for the sequence, I need to output multiple turns.\n\nBut the state may change, but since no food, I can plan.\n\nTo maximize survival, moving up is good.\n\nSo for turn 59: U\n\nThen turn 60: from (1,3), move U to (1,4)\n\nTurn 61: from (1,4), move U to (1,5)  (since L wall, cannot D reverse, so U or R, but U to explore)\n\nAt (1,4), direction U, can go U or R (since L wall, cannot D)\n\nU to (1,5) or R to (2,4)\n\nI think U to (1,5) is better to reach top.\n\nThen turn 62: from (1,5) to (1,6)  (U, only choice since L wall, R to (2,5) possible, but U to (1,6) first)\n\nFrom (1,5), direction U, can go U to (1,6), R to (2,5), cannot D or L.\n\nSo U or R.\n\nIf go U to (1,6), then from (1,6) only R to (2,6)\n\nIf go R to (2,5), then from (2,5) can go to (2,6) or (3,5), etc.\n\nBut to be consistent, let's go up.\n\nSo turn 59: U to (1,3)\n\nTurn 60: U to (1,4)\n\nTurn 61: U to (1,5)\n\nTurn 62: U to (1,6)\n\nThen turn 63: from (1,6) move R to (2,6)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut for the answer, since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output for the turns, I think for this response, I need to provide the action for t59 only? No, the answer format shows multiple turns.\n\nLook: \"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action on turn t1 Turn t1 + 1: action on turn t1 + 1 ... }\"\n\nSo I need to provide a sequence of actions for several turns.\n\nBut since the state changes, I have to base on current state and assume no new food or changes.\n\nI think for simplicity, I can provide 5 turns or so.\n\nBut let's start.\n\nTurn 59: action U\n\nThen for turn 60, from (1,3), action U to (1,4)\n\nTurn 61, from (1,4), action U to (1,5)\n\nTurn 62, from (1,5), action U to (1,6)\n\nTurn 63, from (1,6), action R to (2,6)  (since only choice)\n\nThen turn 64, from (2,6), direction R (from (1,6) to (2,6) is right, so direction R), can go U to (2,7) but y=7 wall, not possible, D to (2,5), R to (3,6), cannot L reverse.\n\nU to (2,7) wall, so only D or R.\n\nD to (2,5), R to (3,6)\n\nBoth possible, but let's say R to (3,6) for now.\n\nBut this is arbitrary.\n\nPerhaps from (1,5), I can go R instead to avoid corner.\n\nBut for the purpose, I think for t59, U is fine.\n\nSince moving R at t59 leads to a forced move, it might be riskier if there is a threat, but here no, so both ok.\n\nI think I'll go with U for t59.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\nTurn 59: U\n\nThen for turn 60, from (1,3), move U to (1,4)\n\nBut I need to specify the action.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n</think>\n### Analysis for Turn 59 Decision\n\n**Current State (Turn 59):**\n- **Snake Head Position**: (1, 2)\n- **Head Direction**: Up (U)\n- **Possible Moves**: \n  - U (Up) to (1, 3): Safe, empty cell.\n  - R (Right) to (2, 2): Safe, empty cell.\n  - L (Left) to (0, 2): Wall collision (x=0 is border wall), deadly.\n  - D (Down): Not allowed (instant reverse from current U direction).\n- **Food Status**: \n  - (6, 3): Value=1, Life-span=1. Cannot be eaten this turn (not adjacent to head).\n  - (1, 5): Value=6, Life-span=1. Cannot be eaten this turn (not adjacent to head).\n  - (4, 3): Value=9, Life-span=1. Occupied by snake body; cannot be eaten this turn (head cannot move to it without collision, and body must move away first).\n  - All food has life-span=1 and will disappear after this turn if not eaten. Since no food is accessible this turn, all food will vanish, and no score change occurs.\n- **Snake Length**: 14 segments. After a move with no food eaten, length remains 14 (tail segment removed, new head added).\n- **Grid Constraints**: \n  - Playable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 (borders are walls).\n  - Internal obstacle at (4, 6) blocks access to that cell.\n  - Snake occupies 14 cells, walls occupy 29 cells, leaving 21 empty cells.\n- **Long-Term Survival Priority**: \n  - Move towards open areas (upper rows y=4-6) to avoid crowded bottom rows and reduce collision risk.\n  - Avoid dead ends (e.g., corners like (1,6)).\n  - Sequence must prevent reversals and collisions.\n\n**Move Evaluation for Turn 59:**\n- **U to (1, 3)**:\n  - Pros: Moves toward less crowded upper area (y=3+). Allows flexibility at turn 60 (can go U or R). Better for long-term exploration.\n  - Cons: May lead toward left edge, but manageable with careful pathing.\n- **R to (2, 2)**:\n  - Pros: Moves toward center. \n  - Cons: Forces U to (2, 3) at turn 60 (only safe move), reducing flexibility. Increases risk if future moves are constrained.\n  \n**Decision**: Move U at turn 59. This prioritizes access to open space and maintains option flexibility. After moving U, the head is at (1, 3) with direction U.\n\n### 5-Turn Lookahead Plan\nBased on the current state, a safe sequence for turns 59-63 is planned. Key assumptions:\n- No new food spawns (not provided in state).\n- All existing food vanishes after turn 59.\n- Movements avoid walls, body collisions, and reversals.\n- Path aims for central/open areas (e.g., row y=4-6) to maximize future food access and survival.\n\n**Planned Sequence:**\n1. **Turn 59 (t1)**: U (to (1, 3))  \n   - Head moves to (1, 3), direction U. Snake length unchanged. Food at (4,3) vanishes but was uneatable.\n2. **Turn 60 (t1+1)**: U (to (1, 4))  \n   - From (1, 3), move U to (1, 4) (direction U). Avoids L (wall) and D (reverse). Explores upward toward open space.\n3. **Turn 61 (t1+2)**: U (to (1, 5))  \n   - From (1, 4), move U to (1, 5) (direction U). Avoids L (wall) and D (reverse). R to (2,4) is possible but U prioritizes reaching upper rows faster.\n4. **Turn 62 (t1+3)**: U (to (1, 6))  \n   - From (1, 5), move U to (1, 6) (direction U). Avoids L (wall) and D (reverse). R to (2,5) is possible but U continues upward path. (1,6) is safe but a potential dead end; next move must be R.\n5. **Turn 63 (t1+4)**: R (to (2, 6))  \n   - From (1, 6), move R to (2, 6) (direction R). Only safe move (U to y=7 wall, L to x=0 wall, D reverse). This exits the left edge and enters a more central area.\n\n**Why this sequence?**\n- **Survival Focused**: Moves away from dense body segments in lower rows (y=1-2) toward emptier upper rows (y=4-6). After turn 63, head is at (2,6), allowing access to cells like (3,6), (2,5), etc.\n- **Risk Minimization**: No collisions or reversals. Avoids forcing moves (unlike R at turn 59, which would force U at turn 60).\n- **Flexibility**: By turn 63, the snake can adapt based on new food or state changes (e.g., from (2,6), options include D to (2,5), R to (3,6), or U if possible).\n- **5+ Turn Horizon**: The sequence reaches y=6 by turn 62, opening exploration opportunities. Beyond turn 63, continue toward central cells (e.g., (3,6), (4,5)) while avoiding (4,6) obstacle.\n\n**Final Answer Format:**\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 59: U (up)  \nTurn 60: U (up)  \nTurn 61: U (up)  \nTurn 62: U (up)  \nTurn 63: R (right)  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 60. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (4,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n\nSnake positions: head at (1,3), and body segments: (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3). That's 14 segments. Let me list them in order:\n\n1. Head: (1,3)\n\n2. (1,2)\n\n3. (1,1)\n\n4. (2,1)\n\n5. (3,1)\n\n6. (4,1)\n\n7. (5,1)\n\n8. (6,1)\n\n9. (6,2)\n\n10. (5,2)\n\n11. (4,2)\n\n12. (3,2)\n\n13. (3,3)\n\n14. Tail: (4,3) – I think (4,3) is the tail, but let's confirm the list: positions are [(1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3)]. So head (1,3), then down to (1,1), right to (6,1), up to (6,2), left to (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), then up to (3,3), and right to tail (4,3). So tail is at (4,3).\n\nSnake head direction is U, which is up. So current movement is upwards.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (1,5) with life span 6 and value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (4,3) with life span 8 and value 1 (positive food)\n\n(4,3) is the tail position! According to the food list, it's (4,3) with life span 8 and value 1. But the snake's tail is also at (4,3). This is important because of the special case: food can spawn under the body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves onto it.\n\nIn this case, the food is under the tail. Since the tail will move when the snake moves, unless it eats food.\n\nWhen the snake moves without eating, the tail moves forward, so the cell is vacated. But if it eats, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows.\n\nBut here, food is at (4,3), which is the tail. So if the snake eats it, it will grow, meaning the tail stays, and a new segment is added, so head moves to (4,3) but since tail is there, it would collide? No.\n\nTail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and newly grown tail collide.\n\nLet me read that again.\n\n\"**Tail Reward Danger**: If the head is *adjacent to the tail* and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nIn this case, head is at (1,3), tail at (4,3). Are they adjacent? Let's see coordinates: (1,3) and (4,3). x differs by 3, y same, so not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so |Δx| + |Δy| = 1.\n\n(1,3) to (4,3): |1-4| = 3 > 1, so not adjacent. Head is at (1,3), tail at (4,3), so they are not adjacent; there are other body segments in between.\n\nFor example, (3,3) is a body segment next to tail? Positions: ... (3,3), (4,3). So (3,3) and (4,3) are adjacent, but head is at (1,3), which is not adjacent to tail directly.\n\nThe condition is when head is adjacent to tail. Here, head is not adjacent to tail; it's three cells away horizontally.\n\nSo for food at (4,3), it's on the tail, but since head is not adjacent, it might be safe to eat, but we need to move such that head moves to (4,3) after the tail moves away or something.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (4,3). Food is also at (4,3), under the tail.\n\nWhen the snake moves, if it doesn't eat food, the tail moves, so (4,3) becomes empty, and food is still there? Food is on the cell, so when tail moves, the cell is vacated, and food is present, so it can be eaten later.\n\nBut if the snake moves and eats the food when head goes to that cell, it grows, so tail doesn't move.\n\nBut since the food is under the tail now, to eat it, the head needs to move to (4,3) after the tail has moved away.\n\nThat is, in a future turn, when the snake moves without eating, tail moves, vacating (4,3), then later head can move to it to eat the food.\n\nBut food has a life span; it disappears after N turns.\n\nSimilarly for other food.\n\nNow, food at (1,5) with life span 6, value 1.\n\nFood at (4,3) with life span 8, value 1.\n\nCurrent turn t=60.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 60, life span 6 means it will disappear after 6 more turns, so at turn 66 it's gone? Life span N means it disappears after N turns, and countdown decreases each turn.\n\nSo at turn t, food has life span L, it will disappear at turn t + L.\n\nFor (1,5): life span 6 at t=60, so it will be there until turn 60+6-1? Or turn 60+6?\n\n\"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nAt turn t, countdown is N. After this turn, it becomes N-1, and so on, until countdown 0, then it disappears at the end of that turn or beginning? Typically, it disappears when countdown reaches 0.\n\nLet's assume: at the start of turn t, if life span is L, after the turn, it decreases to L-1. When L=1, after the turn, it disappears. So available during the turn if L >=1.\n\nFor food at (1,5): life span 6 at turn 60, so:\n\n- Turn 60: available, after turn, life span 5\n\n- Turn 61: available, life span 4\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn 65: available, life span 1\n\n- After turn 65, it disappears, so not available on turn 66.\n\nSimilarly for (4,3): life span 8 at turn 60, so available from turn 60 to 67, disappears after turn 67.\n\nNow, snake head at (1,3), direction U (up).\n\nPossible moves: since direction is U, I can move U, L, R, but not D because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed.\n\nCurrent direction U, so possible moves: U (up), L (left), R (right). D (down) is opposite, not allowed.\n\nNow, grid limits: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so I can't go to those cells.\n\nAlso internal obstacle at (4,6), so can't go there.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid.\n\nLet me sketch a grid. x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No.\n\nBorder cells are walls: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. So cells like (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (1,0) to (6,0), (1,7) to (6,7) are all walls. But internal cells are free, except obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle: (4,6) is a wall.\n\nPlayable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (4,6) is wall.\n\nx=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, but (4,6) is blocked.\n\nNow snake positions:\n\nHead: (1,3)\n\nThen: (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3)\n\nTail: (4,3)\n\nSo let's plot this:\n\nRow y=1: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\ny=2: (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) — from positions: (6,1) then (6,2), then (5,2), (4,2), (3,2)\n\ny=3: head (1,3), then (3,3), (4,3) — positions: after (3,2) it's (3,3), then (4,3)\n\n(1,3) is head, then the body goes to (1,2), which is below, but (1,3) to (1,2) is down, but head direction is U, meaning it was moving up to (1,3)? Let's see the sequence.\n\nSnake positions: [(1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3)]\n\nSo from head to tail: (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (6,1) -> (6,2) -> (5,2) -> (4,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,3) -> (4,3)\n\nSo at (1,3), it came from (1,2), so it was moving down to (1,3)? Position list is head first, so previous head was at (1,2) I think? But head direction is given as U, meaning current direction is up.\n\nHead direction is U, which is the direction it is facing now, so from (1,3), it can move up.\n\nBut how did it get to (1,3)? From the positions, before (1,3) it was at (1,2), so it moved up from (1,2) to (1,3), so direction is U, consistent.\n\nThen from (1,3), possible moves:\n\n- Up (U) to (1,4)\n\n- Left (L) to (0,3) but x=0 is wall, so invalid\n\n- Right (R) to (2,3)\n\n- Down (D) is opposite to U, not allowed.\n\nSo only possible moves: U to (1,4) or R to (2,3)\n\n(1,4): is it free? Let's see if occupied by body or wall.\n\nWalls: x=0 is wall, so (1,4) is not wall, internal obstacle at (4,6), not (1,4).\n\nBody positions: list all body cells except head: (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3)\n\n(1,4) is not in this list, so free.\n\n(2,3): not in body list, not wall, so free.\n\nSo from (1,3), I can go U to (1,4) or R to (2,3).\n\nNow, food at (1,5) and (4,3).\n\n(1,5) is above (1,4), so if I go up to (1,4), then I can go up again to (1,5) to eat the food, but (1,5) has life span 6, so plenty of time.\n\n(4,3) is the tail, with food on it, life span 8.\n\nBut to eat (4,3), I need to go there when it's free, but now it's occupied by tail.\n\nWhen the snake moves, if it doesn't eat, tail moves.\n\nFor example, if I move without eating, tail moves from (4,3) to... let's see the tail movement.\n\nThe tail is at (4,3), and before that is (3,3), so the tail is moving right to (4,3)? Positions: ... (3,2) to (3,3) to (4,3), so from (3,3) to (4,3), so it was moving right to (4,3).\n\nWhen snake moves, if no food eaten, the head moves to a new position, and the tail segment is removed, so tail moves forward.\n\nSo if I move up to (1,4), no food eaten, then new head is (1,4), tail moves, so (4,3) is vacated, and since food is there, it is now accessible.\n\nBut food was at (4,3) under tail, now tail moved, so food is revealed.\n\nThen I can later move to (4,3) to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, if I move right to (2,3), similar.\n\nBut let's think about the paths.\n\nFirst, I need to maximize score, so I should aim to eat both foods if possible, since they are positive.\n\nBut I have to avoid collisions and plan for long term.\n\nAlso, the grid is small, and snake is long, 14 segments, so space is tight.\n\nPlayable area: x=1-6, y=1-6, minus (4,6) wall, so 6x6 -1 = 35 cells minus snake body? Snake is 14 cells, so free cells: 35 - 14 = 21 free cells? 6x6=36 cells, minus one wall at (4,6), so 35 playable cells. Snake occupies 14, so 21 free cells.\n\nBut with walls.\n\nNow, food at (1,5) and (4,3), but (4,3) is occupied, but will be free when tail moves.\n\nLife span: (1,5) must be eaten by turn 65, (4,3) by turn 67.\n\nCurrent turn 60.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nPossible actions for turn 60:\n\nOption 1: Move U to (1,4)\n\nThen head at (1,4), direction U (since moved up).\n\nBody: since no food, tail moves, so tail (4,3) is removed, new tail is (3,3)? Positions: after moving, head to (1,4), then body: previous head (1,3) becomes first body, then (1,2), (1,1), ..., up to (3,3), and tail (4,3) is removed, so new snake: head (1,4), then (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) — and (4,3) gone, so tail is now (3,3).\n\nList: new positions after move U: head to (1,4), then the previous segments except tail: so [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3)] — 14 segments, tail at (3,3).\n\nFood at (4,3) is now free and available, since tail moved.\n\nSimilarly, food at (1,5) still there.\n\nNow from (1,4), I can go U to (1,5) to eat the food, since (1,5) is food.\n\nIf I go U to (1,5), I eat the food, so snake grows: head moves to (1,5), new segment added, tail doesn't move, so body: (1,4), (1,3), ... up to (3,3), and (4,3) is still tail? After eating, tail stays, so positions: head (1,5), then (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), and tail (4,3) — but (4,3) is food, but when I eat at (1,5), the tail is still at (4,3), but since I ate, tail doesn't move, so it stays, but the food is consumed, so (4,3) is now part of snake, tail.\n\nIn this case, I ate at (1,5), so (4,3) is still tail with no food.\n\nBut I can eat (4,3) later if I move to it.\n\nAfter moving to (1,4), if I go to (1,5), I eat, grow to 15 segments.\n\nThen from there, I need to navigate.\n\nBut let's not get ahead; first decision at turn 60.\n\nOption 2: Move R to (2,3)\n\nThen head to (2,3), direction now R (since moved right).\n\nBody: head to (2,3), then (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) — and tail (4,3) removed, so tail now (3,3).\n\nFood at (4,3) free.\n\nFood at (1,5) still there.\n\nFrom (2,3), I can move U, D, L, R, but current direction R, so cannot move L (opposite), so can go U to (2,4), D to (2,2), R to (3,3).\n\n(3,3) is body? After move, positions include (3,3) as body, but (3,3) is part of the body, so moving to (3,3) would cause collision.\n\nAfter moving R to (2,3), positions: head (2,3), then (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) — so (3,3) is the tail.\n\nSo from (2,3), possible moves:\n\n- U to (2,4)\n\n- D to (2,2) — is (2,2) free? Not in body: body has (1,2), (2,1), (3,2), etc., (2,2) not listed, so free.\n\n- R to (3,3) — (3,3) is the tail, and it's adjacent.\n\nNow, moving to tail is allowed only if it moves away, but in general, you can move to the tail cell because when you move, the tail moves, so it doesn't collide.\n\nIn snake games, moving to the tail is safe because the tail moves forward.\n\nThe rules say: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving to (3,3) is safe.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4) and (2,2) should be free.\n\n(2,4): y=4, x=2, not wall, not in body list above, so free.\n\n(2,2): similarly free.\n\nNow, back to turn 60 choice.\n\nIf I go U to (1,4), I can then go to (1,5) to eat the food soon.\n\nIf I go R to (2,3), I might go towards the center or to (4,3) later.\n\nBut (4,3) food is now free after any move, since tail moves.\n\nAt turn 60, after move, tail moves, so (4,3) free.\n\nNow, for long-term, I need to eat both foods.\n\n(1,5) is at top-left, (4,3) is at bottom-right, but (4,3) is now free.\n\nGrid: y=1 bottom, y=6 top? y=0 bottom, y=7 top? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is bottom row, y=6 is top row? Let's define: typically, (0,0) bottom-left, but in coordinates, it might not matter, but for movement.\n\nIn this case, (1,5) is at x=1,y=5, which is left, high y, so top if y increases up.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) is x=4,y=3, middle.\n\nInternal wall at (4,6), which is top row, y=6.\n\ny=6 is the row below y=7 wall, so y=6 is playable? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so cells y=1 to y=6 are playable, but y=6 is not wall, only if x=0 or x=7 or specific.\n\nBorder walls: all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.\n\nInternal cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (4,6) is wall.\n\nSo (1,5) is at (1,5), which is left, top-ish.\n\n(4,3) at (4,3), center.\n\nNow, snake head at (1,3), after turn 60.\n\nIf I move U to (1,4), I am closer to (1,5).\n\nThen at turn 61, if I move U to (1,5), I eat the food, grow to 15 segments.\n\nThen I need to move away from there.\n\nPossible moves from (1,5): after eating, head at (1,5), direction U (if I moved up).\n\nThen from (1,5), I can move U to (1,6), L to (0,5) wall, R to (2,5), D to (1,4) but (1,4) is body? After eating, positions: head (1,5), then (1,4), (1,3), ... down to tail at (3,3) or something.\n\nAfter eating at (1,5): snake grows, so positions: head (1,5), then (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), and tail (4,3) — but (4,3) is tail, and it's occupied.\n\n(1,4) is directly below, which is body.\n\nFrom (1,5), possible moves:\n\n- U to (1,6): y=6, not wall, and not body? Body has (1,4), (1,3), etc., (1,6) not in list, so free.\n\n- D to (1,4): but (1,4) is the first body segment, so collision, cannot.\n\n- L to (0,5): x=0 wall, cannot.\n\n- R to (2,5): not body, not wall, should be free.\n\nSo can go U to (1,6) or R to (2,5).\n\nIf I go to (1,6), then from there, I might be cornered.\n\n(1,6) is top-left corner, walls at (1,7) and (0,6), but (1,6) is playable, but only U and R possible? From (1,6), possible moves: U to (1,7) wall, D to (1,5) body, L to (0,6) wall, R to (2,6). Only R to (2,6) possible.\n\nThen if I go to (2,6), I can explore.\n\nBut let's see the other option at turn 60.\n\nIf at turn 60 I move R to (2,3), then head at (2,3), direction R.\n\nThen I can go to (2,4), (2,2), or (3,3).\n\n(3,3) is tail, but safe to move to.\n\nIf I go to (3,3), then since I move to tail, and no food eaten (assuming no food there, but food was at (4,3), not (3,3)), so I move to (3,3), no eat, tail moves, so new tail is the previous one.\n\nAfter moving to (2,3), positions: head (2,3), body (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) tail.\n\nIf I move to (3,3) from (2,3), to (3,3), which is the current tail position.\n\nWhen I move to (3,3), the head occupies (3,3), and since it was tail, and no food, the tail moves from (3,3) to... the previous segment is (3,2), so tail moves to where? The tail segment is removed, so new tail is (3,2)? Let's see.\n\nStandard snake: when head moves to a new cell, if not food, tail is removed, so the cell vacated.\n\nIf head moves to a cell with food, tail not removed, snake grows.\n\nHere, moving to (3,3), which is occupied by tail, but no food there (food was at (4,3), now free), so (3,3) has no food, I assume, only the cell has food if specified.\n\nFood positions are (1,5) and (4,3), so (3,3) has no food.\n\nSo moving to (3,3): head to (3,3), which was tail, but since no food eaten, the tail is removed, so the snake moves: new head (3,3), then the previous segments except the tail is gone, so body: (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) — and (3,3) was tail, removed, but head is now at (3,3), so positions: head (3,3), then (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) — 14 segments, tail at (3,2).\n\n(3,2) was second last, now tail.\n\nAnd food at (4,3) is free.\n\nNow from (3,3), I can move to (4,3) to eat the food, since (4,3) has food.\n\nMove to (4,3), eat, grow, so head to (4,3), new segment, tail stays, so positions: head (4,3), then (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) — and tail at (3,2), but since ate, no tail move, so (3,2) is still there, but it's part of body.\n\nList: head (4,3), then (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) — 15 segments, tail at (3,2).\n\nAnd I ate the food at (4,3).\n\nSo in this path, by moving right first to (2,3), then to (3,3), then to (4,3), I can eat the (4,3) food on turn 62.\n\nSimilarly, for (1,5) food, I can eat it later, since life span 6, so by turn 65.\n\nBut after eating (4,3), I am at (4,3), with a longer snake.\n\nThen I need to go to (1,5).\n\nBut (1,5) is far, and snake is long, so I might have difficulty navigating.\n\nIf I first eat (1,5) by going up.\n\nAt turn 60, move U to (1,4).\n\nThen turn 61, move U to (1,5), eat, grow to 15.\n\nThen from (1,5), I can only move R or U, as earlier.\n\nIf I move U to (1,6), then from (1,6), only can move R to (2,6).\n\nThen from (2,6), I can move U, D, L, R, but current direction? From (1,5) to (1,6) is U, so direction U.\n\nFrom (1,6) to (2,6) is R, so direction R.\n\nThen from (2,6), direction R, so can move U to (2,7) wall, D to (2,5), L to (1,6) body, R to (3,6).\n\nSo U wall, L body, so only D to (2,5) or R to (3,6).\n\n(2,5) and (3,6) are free, I think.\n\n(3,6): y=6, x=3, not wall, but internal obstacle at (4,6), so (3,6) is free.\n\nThen I can explore.\n\nBut I need to go to (4,3) to eat the other food, but (4,3) is at y=3, x=4, so I need to go down and left.\n\nWith long snake, it might be tight.\n\nIf at turn 60 I move R to (2,3), then I can eat (4,3) soon.\n\nLet's compare the two options.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nAnother thing: after eating (4,3), the snake is at (4,3), with body around.\n\nLet's list the positions after eating (4,3) as above.\n\nHead at (4,3), then (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) tail.\n\nSo the body is dense in the bottom-left.\n\nFrom (4,3), I can move U to (4,4), D to (4,2), L to (3,3), R to (5,3).\n\n(4,4): free?\n\n(4,2): is body, occupied.\n\n(3,3): is body, occupied.\n\n(5,3): free? Not in list, so free.\n\nSo from (4,3), after eating, direction? When I moved to (4,3) from (3,3), so direction R.\n\nThen from (4,3), direction R, so can move U to (4,4), D to (4,2) body, L to (3,3) body, R to (5,3).\n\nOnly U or R possible.\n\nIf I go R to (5,3), then to (6,3), etc., but might lead to right side.\n\nIf I go U to (4,4), then I can go up.\n\nBut I have to eat (1,5) by turn 65.\n\nNow, if I first eat (1,5), I am at (1,5) or (1,6), and need to go to (4,3), but (4,3) might be eaten or not, but I can eat it later.\n\nBut with long snake, moving might be hard.\n\nPerhaps I should eat (4,3) first since it's closer and available now.\n\nAt turn 60, if I move R to (2,3), then turn 61 move to (3,3), turn 62 move to (4,3) and eat.\n\nThen I have eaten one food, at turn 62.\n\nThen I need to eat (1,5) by turn 65.\n\nFrom (4,3), after eating, I am at (4,3), can go U to (4,4) or R to (5,3).\n\nIf I go U to (4,4), then to (4,5), etc.\n\nBut (1,5) is at (1,5), so I need to go left.\n\nBut the body is blocking the bottom.\n\nFor example, from (4,4), I can go L to (3,4), U to (4,5), etc.\n\nBut to reach (1,5), I need to go to (1,4) or something, but (1,4) is body if I ate (1,5) first, but in this case, I didn't eat (1,5) yet.\n\nIn this scenario, I eat (4,3) first at turn 62.\n\nThen at turn 62, head at (4,3), just ate, so positions as above.\n\nThen turn 63, from (4,3), move U to (4,4) (assume).\n\nDirection after moving to (4,3) is R, so from (4,3), move U to (4,4), now direction U.\n\nThen positions: head (4,4), then (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) — tail at (3,2).\n\n(4,4) free.\n\nThen from (4,4), direction U, can move U to (4,5), D to (4,3) body, L to (3,4), R to (5,4).\n\n(4,5) free, (3,4) free, (5,4) free.\n\nSay I move U to (4,5) to go up.\n\nThen turn 64, head at (4,5), direction U.\n\nCan move U to (4,6), but (4,6) is internal obstacle, wall, cannot.\n\nD to (4,4) body, L to (3,5), R to (5,5).\n\nSo only L or R.\n\nSay move L to (3,5).\n\nThen turn 65, head at (3,5), direction L? From (4,5) to (3,5) is L, so direction L.\n\nCan move U to (3,6), D to (3,4), L to (2,5), R to (4,5) body.\n\n(3,6) free, (3,4) free, (2,5) free.\n\n(1,5) is food at (1,5), which is two left from (3,5), so I can go L to (2,5), then L to (1,5) on turn 66, but (1,5) life span: at turn 60, life 6, so after turn 60, life 5 at 61, 4 at 62, 3 at 63, 2 at 64, 1 at 65, so on turn 65, it is available, after turn 65 it disappears, so on turn 66 it is gone. So must eat on turn 65 or before.\n\nTurn 65 is the last turn to eat (1,5).\n\nAt turn 65, head at (3,5), I can move L to (2,5), but (2,5) is not (1,5), so I can eat on turn 65 only if I move directly to (1,5), but from (3,5), (1,5) is not adjacent; it's two away.\n\nFrom (3,5) at turn 65, I can move to (2,5), (3,6), or (3,4), none of which is (1,5), so I cannot eat (1,5) on turn 65 from here.\n\nI need to be at (1,5) on turn 65.\n\nSo I need to reach (1,5) by turn 65.\n\nIf I am at (3,5) on turn 65, I can move to (2,5) or (3,4) or (3,6), but not to (1,5).\n\nSo I cannot eat it.\n\nIf I go directly towards (1,5) earlier.\n\nFor example, after eating (4,3) at turn 62, head at (4,3), instead of going up, I go left or down, but down is blocked.\n\nFrom (4,3), after eating, I can only go U or R.\n\nIf I go R to (5,3), then I am going away from (1,5), worse.\n\nSo from (4,3), I must go U to (4,4) to have a chance to go left.\n\nThen from (4,4), I can go L to (3,4).\n\nTurn 63: from (4,3) move U to (4,4)\n\nTurn 64: from (4,4) move L to (3,4)  // now at (3,4)\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen turn 65: from (3,4), can move U to (3,5), D to (3,3) body, L to (2,4), R to (4,4) body.\n\n(3,5) free, (2,4) free.\n\n(1,5) is at (1,5), which is adjacent to (1,4) or (2,5), etc.\n\nFrom (3,4) at turn 65, I can move to (2,4) or (3,5), not directly to (1,5).\n\n(1,5) is at distance, so I cannot reach it on turn 65 from here.\n\nIf I go to (2,4) on turn 65, then on turn 66, I can move to (1,4) or (2,5), but (1,5) is gone after turn 65, so no.\n\nTherefore, if I eat (4,3) first, I may not be able to reach (1,5) in time to eat it, because after eating (4,3), I am at (4,3) on turn 62, and it takes at least 3 moves to reach (1,5): e.g., (4,3) to (4,4) to (3,4) to (2,4) to (1,4) to (1,5), that's 4 moves to (1,5), from turn 63 to 66, but turn 66 too late.\n\nFrom turn 62 position (4,3):\n\nTurn 63: to (4,4)\n\nTurn 64: to (3,4)  // L from (4,4)\n\nTurn 65: to (2,4)  // L from (3,4)\n\nThen on turn 65, at (2,4), not (1,5).\n\nTo (1,5), I need to go from (2,4) to (1,4) or (2,5), then to (1,5) on turn 66, but food gone.\n\nIf I go to (3,5) on turn 65, same thing.\n\nSo I cannot reach (1,5) by turn 65 if I start from (4,3) on turn 62.\n\nTherefore, I must eat (1,5) first, since it has shorter life span.\n\nAt turn 60, I should move towards (1,5).\n\nSo move U to (1,4) on turn 60.\n\nThen turn 61, move U to (1,5), eat the food.\n\nNow, after eating, at turn 61, head at (1,5), direction U.\n\nPositions: head (1,5), then (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3) tail. 15 segments.\n\nFrom (1,5), can move U to (1,6) or R to (2,5), as earlier.\n\nIf I move U to (1,6), then I am at corner, must move R to (2,6) on next turn.\n\nThen from (2,6), can move D to (2,5) or R to (3,6).\n\nNow, I need to eat (4,3) later, which has life span 8, so until turn 67.\n\nBut (4,3) is currently the tail, and will move when I don't eat.\n\nSince I just ate, tail doesn't move yet.\n\nAt turn 61, after eating at (1,5), tail is at (4,3), and food is still there, but under tail.\n\nWhen I move without eating, tail will move, vacating (4,3).\n\nFor example, at turn 61, after moving to (1,5) and eating, I am at (1,5).\n\nTurn 62, I need to move, say U to (1,6).\n\nThen no eat, so tail moves. Tail was at (4,3), and before that (3,3), so tail moves to... positions: head to (1,6), then (1,5), (1,4), ..., and tail (4,3) removed, so new tail is (3,3)? List: after move to (1,6), no eat, so head (1,6), then (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) — and (4,3) gone, tail now (3,3).\n\nFood at (4,3) is now free and available.\n\nFrom (1,6), I move R to (2,6), as only choice.\n\nTurn 62: move R to (2,6), direction R.\n\nNo eat, so tail moves. Tail at (3,3), before that (3,2), so tail moves from (3,3) to? When head moves to (2,6), tail is removed, so new positions: head (2,6), then (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) — tail at (3,2).\n\n(3,3) was removed, but food at (4,3) is free.\n\nNow I need to go to (4,3) to eat it.\n\nBut (4,3) is at (4,3), I am at (2,6), which is top.\n\nFrom (2,6), I can move D to (2,5) or R to (3,6).\n\nSay I move D to (2,5).\n\nTurn 63: head to (2,5), direction? From (2,6) to (2,5) is D, so direction D.\n\nThen can move D to (2,4), L to (1,5) body, R to (3,5), U to (2,6) body.\n\n(1,5) is body, (2,6) body, so only D to (2,4) or R to (3,5).\n\nSay move D to (2,4).\n\nTurn 64: head to (2,4), direction D.\n\nCan move D to (2,3), L to (1,4) body, R to (3,4), U to (2,5) body.\n\n(1,4) body, (2,5) body, so only D to (2,3) or R to (3,4).\n\n(2,3) might be free or not.\n\nCurrent positions: head (2,4), then (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) tail.\n\n(2,3) not in list, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) free.\n\nIf I move D to (2,3).\n\nTurn 65: head to (2,3), direction D.\n\nThen can move D to (2,2), L to (1,3) body, R to (3,3), U to (2,4) body.\n\n(1,3) body, (2,4) body, so only D to (2,2) or R to (3,3).\n\n(2,2) free, (3,3) free.\n\nThen I can continue to (3,3), then to (4,3) to eat.\n\nBut (4,3) food is available until turn 67.\n\nAt turn 65, I am at (2,3), can move to (3,3) on turn 66, then to (4,3) on turn 67 to eat.\n\nTurn 67: life span was 8 at turn 60, so at turn 60: L=8, turn 61: L=7, ..., turn 67: L=1, available during turn 67, disappears after turn 67.\n\nSo on turn 67, I can eat it.\n\nSimilarly, from (2,3) at turn 65, move R to (3,3) on turn 66.\n\nThen turn 66, head to (3,3), no eat (assuming), tail moves, etc.\n\nThen turn 67, move to (4,3) and eat.\n\nYes, possible.\n\nIf at turn 64 from (2,4) I move R to (3,4) instead, then to (3,3), etc., similar.\n\nBut let's confirm the path.\n\nSo back to turn 60, I should move U to (1,4) to set up eating (1,5).\n\nThen turn 61, move U to (1,5) and eat.\n\nThen from (1,5), I need to move to avoid being stuck. Since U and R are possible, but if I go U to (1,6), I must then go R to (2,6), which is fine.\n\nThen from (2,6), I can go D to (2,5) or R to (3,6).\n\nTo reach (4,3), better to go down, so D to (2,5).\n\nThen to (2,4), (2,3), etc.\n\nAs above.\n\nBut in the sequence, after turn 61, I am at (1,5), ate.\n\nTurn 62: move U to (1,6) — but from (1,5), if I move U to (1,6), that's fine.\n\nThen turn 62: at (1,6), move R to (2,6)\n\nTurn 63: at (2,6), move D to (2,5)\n\nTurn 64: at (2,5), move D to (2,4) — from (2,5) to (2,4) is D, direction D.\n\nThen turn 65: at (2,4), move D to (2,3) — possible.\n\nThen turn 66: at (2,3), move R to (3,3) — (3,3) should be free.\n\nAfter turn 65 move to (2,3), positions: head (2,3), then (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) tail.\n\n(3,3) not occupied, free.\n\nTurn 66: move to (3,3), no eat, so tail moves. Tail at (3,2), before that? Positions before move: tail (3,2), and (4,2), (5,2), etc., but when head moves to (3,3), no eat, tail removed, so new head (3,3), body (2,3), (2,4), ..., up to (3,2)? Let's not list all, but (3,3) free to move.\n\nAfter move, positions: head (3,3), then (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2) — and (3,2) removed? Tail was (3,2), removed, so new tail is (4,2)? Segments: after head to (3,3), the previous body is all except tail, so (2,3), (2,4), ..., down to (4,2), and (3,2) gone, so tail is (4,2).\n\nPositions: head (3,3), then (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2) — so 15 segments? Head and 14 body, but we had 15 before moving? At turn 65, before move, snake has 15 segments: positions from (2,3) head? At turn 65, after moving to (2,3), positions: head (2,3), then (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) — that's 19 positions? I think I miscounted.\n\nSnake length: originally 14, ate one food, so 15 segments.\n\nPositions at turn 65 after move to (2,3): head (2,3), then the body: from turn 64 head was (2,4), so (2,4) becomes body, then (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) tail.\n\nThat's head + 17 body?

But it should be 15.\n\nI think I have a mistake.\n\nStart over: after eating at turn 61, snake has 15 segments: head (1,5), then (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3) tail.\n\nTurn 62: move U to (1,6), no eat, so head to (1,6), then body: (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) — and tail (4,3) removed, so positions: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) — 15 segments?

(3,4) to (4,4) right, (3,3) down, (3,5) up, (4,3) is diagonal, not adjacent, so cannot.\n\nSo from (3,4) at turn 66, on turn 67 I can go to (4,4), (3,5), or (3,3), none is (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is adjacent to (4,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,3).\n\nSo to be at (4,3) on turn 67, on turn 66 I need to be at a adjacent cell, like (4,4), (3,3), (4,2), or (5,3).\n\nBut at turn 65, I am at (2,4), which is not adjacent to those.\n\nFrom (2,4) at turn 65, I can move to (2,3) or (3,4).\n\nIf I move to (2,3) on turn 66, then at (2,3), I can on turn 67 move to (3,3), which is adjacent to (4,3), but not (4,3) itself.\n\nIf I move to (3,4) on turn 66, same issue.\n\nSo I cannot reach (4,3) by turn 67 from here because of the distance.\n\nTurn 65: at (2,4)\n\nTurn 66: to (3,4) or (2,3)\n\nTurn 67: from (3,4) to (4,4), (3,5), (3,3) — not (4,3)\n\nFrom (2,3) to (2,2), (3,3) — not (4,3)\n\n(4,3) is two moves away from (2,4): e.g., (2,4) to (3,4) to (4,4) or to (3,3) to (4,3), but that would be turn 68 for (4,3).\n\nSince I need to be at (4,3) on turn 67, I must be adjacent on turn 66.\n\nSo on turn 66, I need to be at (4,4), (3,3), (4,2), or (5,3).\n\nBut on turn 65, I am at (2,4), which is not adjacent to any of those; closest is (3,3) or (3,4), but (3,3) is not directly adjacent to (2,4).\n\n(2,4) to (3,3) is diagonal, not allowed, so I need to move to (3,4) or (2,3) or (3,3) but (3,3) may not be accessible directly.\n\nFrom (2,4), I can go to (3,4) or (2,3), both are one step, but from there to the target cells.\n\nFor example, from (2,4) to (3,4) turn 66, then from (3,4) I can go to (3,3) or (4,4) on turn 67, but not to (4,3).\n\n(4,3) can only be reached from (4,4), (3,3), etc.\n\nBut from (3,4), I can go to (4,4) on turn 67, then to (4,3) on turn 68, late.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (2,3) on turn 66, then to (3,3) on turn 67, then to (4,3) on turn 68.\n\nBut turn 68 is after turn 67, food gone.\n\nTherefore, with this path, I cannot eat the (4,3) food because I don't reach it in time.\n\nBut earlier I thought I could, but the timing is tight.\n\nTo eat (4,3) on turn 67, I need to be adjacent on turn 66.\n\nOn turn 66, I need to be at a cell adjacent to (4,3), like (4,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,3).\n\nWhere am I on turn 66?\n\nIn the sequence, after eating (1,5), I went up and right, so by turn 66, I am at (2,5) or something, not near (4,3).\n\nFor example, at turn 62, I am at (2,6), turn 63 at (2,5), turn 64 at (2,4), turn 65 at (2,3) or (3,4), all far from (4,3).\n\nSo I need a different path after eating (1,5).\n\nAfter eating at (1,5) on turn 61, instead of going U to (1,6), I should go R to (2,5) directly.\n\nTurn 61: from (1,5) move R to (2,5).\n\nThen head at (2,5), direction R.\n\nNo eat, so tail moves. Tail was at (4,3), removed, so new positions: head (2,5), then (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) — tail at (3,3)? After tail removal, body: (1,5), (1,4), ..., (3,2), and (3,3) is included? Let's list: head to (2,5), then previous head (1,5) body, then (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), and tail (4,3) removed, so new tail is (3,2)? Positions: (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) — tail (3,2).\n\n(3,3) gone, food at (4,3) free.\n\nFrom (2,5), direction R, can move U to (2,6), D to (2,4), L to (1,5) body, R to (3,5).\n\n(1,5) body, so U, D, or R.\n\n(2,6) free, (2,4) free, (3,5) free.\n\nNow, to reach (4,3), I can go down and right.\n\nFor example, move D to (2,4) on turn 62.\n\nTurn 62: head to (2,4), direction D.\n\nThen can move D to (2,3), L to (1,4) body, R to (3,4), U to (2,5) body.\n\nOnly D or R.\n\nSay move D to (2,3).\n\nTurn 63: head to (2,3), direction D.\n\nCan move D to (2,2), L to (1,3) body, R to (3,3), U to (2,4) body.\n\nOnly D or R.\n\n(3,3) is free, so move R to (3,3).\n\nTurn 64: head to (3,3), direction R.\n\nCan move U to (3,4), D to (3,2) body, L to (2,3) body, R to (4,3).\n\n(3,2) body, (2,3) body, so only U to (3,4) or R to (4,3).\n\n(4,3) has food, so I can move R to (4,3) and eat on turn 64.\n\nTurn 64, eat at (4,3), good.\n\nLife span: turn 64 is within 67, so yes.\n\nThen I have eaten both foods.\n\nPerfect.\n\nSo path:\n\nTurn 60: move U to (1,4)\n\nTurn 61: move U to (1,5) eat first food\n\nTurn 62: move R to (2,5)  // from (1,5) to (2,5)\n\nAt turn 61, after eating, at (1,5), move R to (2,5)\n\nThen turn 62, at (2,5), move D to (2,4)  // to go down\n\nIn the sequence above, I said turn 62 move D to (2,4), but let's align.\n\nTurn 61: from (1,5) move R to (2,5)\n\nThen turn 62: from (2,5) move D to (2,4)\n\nTurn 63: from (2,4) move D to (2,3)? Earlier I said from (2,5) to (2,4) to (2,3), but from (2,4) I can move to (2,3) or R to (3,4)\n\nIn my earlier, I moved to (2,3) on turn 63.\n\nBut at turn 63 from (2,4), if I move to (2,3), then to (3,3) on turn 64, then to (4,3) on turn 65? No.\n\nAt turn 62: after moving to (2,5) at turn 61, then turn 62 move to (2,4)\n\nThen at (2,4), turn 63 move to (2,3) or (3,4)\n\nIf move to (2,3), turn 63 head at (2,3)\n\nThen turn 64 move to (3,3) or (2,2)\n\nIf move to (3,3), turn 64 head at (3,3)\n\nThen from (3,3), I can move directly to (4,3) to eat on turn 64.\n\nYes.\n\nFrom (2,4), if I move to (3,4) on turn 63, then from (3,4) I can move to (3,3) or (4,4) on turn 64, then to (4,3) on turn 65, which is also fine, but later.\n\nBut with move to (2,3) then (3,3), I can eat on turn 64.\n\nTurn 64 is earlier, but not necessary.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 60: U to (1,4)\n\nTurn 61: U to (1,5) eat\n\nTurn 62: R to (2,5)  // from (1,5) to (2,5)\n\nTurn 63: D to (2,4)  // from (2,5) to (2,4), direction D? From (2,5) to (2,4) is D, yes.\n\nThen at turn 63, head at (2,4), can move to (2,3) or (3,4)\n\nTo reach (4,3) faster, move to (2,3) on turn 64? Turn 63 is at (2,4), move to (2,3) on turn 64? Let's index turns.\n\nTurn 60: action U\n\nTurn 61: action U to (1,5)\n\nTurn 62: action R to (2,5)\n\nNow turn 63: from (2,5), move to (2,4) or other.\n\nIf I move to (2,4) on turn 63, then head at (2,4)\n\nTurn 64: from (2,4), move to (2,3) or (3,4)\n\nIf move to (2,3) on turn 64, head at (2,3)\n\nTurn 65: from (2,3), move to (3,3) or (2,2)\n\nIf move to (3,3) on turn 65, head at (3,3)\n\nTurn 66: from (3,3), move to (4,3) and eat.\n\nBut turn 66 is within life span, since turn 67 is last.\n\nTurn 66: L for (4,3) at turn 60 L=8, turn 66: L=8-6=2? Turn 60: L=8, after turn 60, L=7 at start turn 61, ..., so at start of turn t, life span decreases after the turn.\n\nAt turn 60, life span N means available during turn 60, after turn, N-1.\n\nSo for (4,3): turn 60 L=8, available turns 60 to 67 (since after turn 67, L=0, disappear).\n\nSimilarly, at turn 66, L=8-6=2? Turn 60: L=8\n\nAfter turn 60: L=7 (for turn 61)\n\nAfter turn 61: L=6 (turn 62)\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 66: L=2 for turn 67? Let's:\n\n- Start turn 60: L=8, available\n\n- After turn 60: L=7\n\n- Start turn 61: L=7, available\n\n- After turn 61: L=6\n\n- ...\n\n- Start turn 67: L=1, available\n\n- After turn 67: L=0, disappear\n\nSo available from turn 60 to 67 inclusive.\n\nTurn 67 is last chance.\n\nIn the sequence, eating on turn 66 is fine.\n\nBut in my alternative, from turn 63 at (2,4), I can move to (3,4) on turn 64, then to (4,4) or (3,3) on turn 65, then to (4,3) on turn 66.\n\nSame.\n\nBut earlier with direct move: at turn 63, from (2,5) move to (3,5) instead.\n\nBut to save time.\n\nIn the path I have, after turn 62 at (2,5), on turn 63 I move D to (2,4), then turn 64 move to (2,3), turn 65 move to (3,3), turn 66 move to (4,3) and eat.\n\nYes.\n\nSince on turn 63 at (2,5), I can move R to (3,5), then D to (3,4), etc., but may not be faster.\n\nSo the first path is fine.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the instruction is to output for turns t1 to t1+k, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and output actions, but it might be for the immediate decision, but the format shows multiple turns.\n\nThe answer format is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn \\(t_1\\): action\nTurn \\(t_1 + 1\\): action\n...\n}\n\nBut it doesn't specify how many turns, but since it says think 5+ turns, I should output at least 5 turns.\n\nt1=60, so turns 60 to 64 or 65.\n\nIn the sequence, I have actions for 60,61,62, and then I need to specify further.\n\nBut for the decision, at turn 60, I decide U, then at 61 U, etc.\n\nBut to be complete, I can output the path to eat both foods.\n\nSo for turn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: U (to eat (1,5))\n\nTurn 62: R (to (2,5))\n\nThen turn 63: D (to (2,4)) // from (2,5) to (2,4)\n\nTurn 64: D (to (2,3)) // from (2,4) to (2,3)\n\nTurn 65: R (to (3,3)) // from (2,3) to (3,3)\n\nTurn 66: R (to (4,3)) // from (3,3) to (4,3) eat\n\nBut turn 66 is beyond 5 turns, but I can output up to turn 65 or so.\n\nSince the food is eaten later, but for now, I think outputting the actions for the next few turns is fine.\n\nPrioritize the immediate action with long-term in mind.\n\nAt turn 60, moving U is better to get the time-sensitive food.\n\nIf I move R at turn 60, I can eat (4,3) faster but miss (1,5), which is worse.\n\nSo U is correct.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to specify the actions.\n\nAlso, ensure no collision.\n\nIn the path, all moves should be valid.\n\nFor example, at turn 60: move U to (1,4), free.\n\nTurn 61: move U to (1,5), eat, ok.\n\nTurn 62: move R to (2,5), free.\n\nTurn 63: move D to (2,4), free.\n\nTurn 64: move D to (2,3), free.\n\nTurn 65: move R to (3,3), free.\n\nAll good.\n\nI could output fewer turns, but 5+ turns.\n\nSo for 5 turns: turns 60 to 64.\n\nActions: U, U, R, D, D\n\nBut at turn 64, I am at (2,3), and I need to go to (3,3) next.\n\nBut for the output, it should be fine.\n\nTo eat the second food, but I don't need to specify beyond.\n\nSince the question is to maximize score, eating both is good.\n\nNow, about the internal wall at (4,6), but in this path, I don't go there, so no issue.\n\nAlso, no negative food, so all good.\n\nSo the plan is set.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating both positive foods while ensuring long-term survival, I must prioritize eating the food at (1,5) first due to its shorter life span (6 turns remaining, disappearing after turn 65). The food at (4,3) has a longer life span (8 turns remaining, disappearing after turn 67) and is currently under the tail, but it will become accessible after the tail moves. Moving up on turn 60 positions the snake to eat (1,5) quickly. After eating (1,5), the snake will navigate toward (4,3) to eat it by turn 66, within its life span.\n\nThe planned actions for turns 60 to 65 are as follows, ensuring no collisions with walls, obstacles, or the snake's body, and adhering to movement constraints (no instant reverse). Each move is chosen to avoid dead ends and maintain access to open space.\n\n- **Turn 60 (current state)**: Move U (up) to (1,4). This avoids the left wall and moves toward (1,5). Direction becomes U.\n- **Turn 61**: Move U (up) to (1,5) to eat the first food (value +1, snake length increases to 15). Direction becomes U.\n- **Turn 62**: Move R (right) to (2,5) to avoid the top-left corner and start moving toward (4,3). Direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 63**: Move D (down) to (2,4) to continue toward the center and approach (4,3). Direction becomes D.\n- **Turn 64**: Move D (down) to (2,3) to position for a move to (3,3). Direction becomes D.\n- **Turn 65**: Move R (right) to (3,3) to prepare for eating (4,3) on the next turn. Direction becomes R.\n\nThis sequence eats the first food on turn 61 and positions the snake to eat the second food on turn 66 (by moving R to (4,3)), which is within its life span. Beyond turn 65, the snake can safely eat (4,3) and continue exploring the grid for more food or survival.\n\n**Key considerations for long-term survival**:\n- The grid has limited space (8x8 with walls and obstacles), so the snake must avoid trapping itself, especially after growing.\n- After eating both foods, the snake should head toward open areas (e.g., right or center) to avoid the dense body segments in the bottom-left.\n- No negative food is present, so all food consumption increases the score.\n- All moves are validated: no wall or obstacle collisions (e.g., internal obstacle at (4,6) is avoided), and body collisions are prevented by not moving into non-tail body segments.\n- Turn-by-turn path is collision-free, with directions managed to prevent instant reverses.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 60: U \\\\\nTurn 61: U \\\\\nTurn 62: R \\\\\nTurn 63: D \\\\\nTurn 64: D \\\\\nTurn 65: R\n}",

        "step": 61,
        "score": 14,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 61, and I'm the snake AI. My goal is to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks, thinking at least 5 turns ahead for long-term survival.\n\n**Grid Setup:**\n- Walls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n- So, playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), except (4,6) is blocked.\n\n**Snake Positions:**\n- Snake body: [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3)]\n- Head is at (1,4) and direction is Up (U). Since direction is U, that means the snake is moving upwards, so from (1,4) to (1,5) would be up, but let's confirm coordinates. Typically in grids, y increases upwards or downwards? The movement says U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, meaning higher y is north or up direction.\n\nIn the movement: U (x,y+1), so moving up increases y. So (1,4) to (1,5) is up.\n\nCurrent head at (1,4), direction U, so it came from below, meaning the previous position was (1,3), which is part of the body.\n\n**Food:**\n- Three food items:\n  1. (1,5) with value +1, life span 5 (so it disappears after 5 turns, including current turn 61? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 61, life span 5 means it has 5 turns left including this one, so it will disappear after turn 65? Let's clarify.\n\nLife span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So if life span is S at turn T, it will disappear after turn T + S - 1? For example, at turn T, life span S, after turn T, it has S-1 left, and so on, until S=0, it disappears at the end of that turn or beginning? The rule says \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nAssume that at the start of turn T, if food has life span L, then after the turn, L decreases by 1. If L=1 at start, it is available during the turn, but disappears after the turn.\n\nSimilarly, for eating: if head moves to food cell during a move, it is eaten.\n\nFor food at (1,5): position (1,5), value +1, life span 5 at turn 61. So:\n- Turn 61: life span 5\n- After turn 61, life span 4\n- After turn 62, life span 3\n- After turn 63, life span 2\n- After turn 64, life span 1\n- After turn 65, it disappears, so not available on turn 66 or later. So it can be eaten from turn 61 to 65 inclusive? At turn 65, life span 1, if eaten, it's consumed; if not, it disappears after turn 65.\n\nSince countdown decreases after the turn, at the beginning of turn T, life span L means it has L turns left including this one. So for L=5 on turn 61, it is present on turns 61,62,63,64,65. After turn 65, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFood:\n- (1,5): value +1, life span 5 (turns 61-65)\n- (4,3): value +1, life span 7 (turns 61-67)\n- (4,5): value +1, life span 10 (turns 61-70)\n\nAll are positive food, no negative food mentioned, so all are good to eat, but with risks.\n\nNow, snake head at (1,4), direction U. So possible moves from (1,4):\n- Up (U): to (1,5) – but (1,5) has food? Let's see if it's occupied or not.\n\n(1,5) is a food position, but food can be eaten if head moves there. However, we need to check if it's safe.\n\nFirst, what are possible moves from (1,4):\n- U: (1,5) – this is within bounds? Walls: x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls. So (1,5): x=1 between 1 and 6? Playable area: since borders are walls, x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? Walls: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Internal obstacle (4,6).\n\nSo (1,5): x=1, y=5. x=1 is not 0 or 7, y=5 not 0 or 7, so not wall. Also, not (4,6), so it's free, but has food.\n\nNow, is (1,5) occupied by snake body? Snake positions: head (1,4), then (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), etc. (1,5) is not in the list, so it's not body. So moving to (1,5) is possible and would eat the food.\n\nBut we have to consider the Tail Reward Danger.\n\nTail Reward Danger: If head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nFirst, where is the tail? Snake positions: list is head first, so last element is tail. Positions: [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3)]\n\nSo tail is at (3,3).\n\nHead is at (1,4), tail at (3,3). Are they adjacent? Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up/down/left/right.\n\n(1,4) and (3,3): difference in x is 2, y is 1, so not adjacent; they are diagonal, not sharing an edge. So not adjacent.\n\nTherefore, no immediate Tail Reward Danger for this food.\n\nBut if I eat the food at (1,5), the snake will grow, so new tail will be added, but since I eat, length increases.\n\nWhen I eat food, on the next turn, when I move, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one segment.\n\nBut for collision, after eating, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail remains, so the new segment is added at the head position? No.\n\nStandard snake: when head moves to food, it eats it, so the head is now on the food cell, and the body follows, but since it ate food, on the next move, when the head moves away, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one cell.\n\nFor example: current positions: head at A, body segments. Head moves to food cell F, eats it. Now positions: head at F, body segments behind. Then next turn, head moves to new cell, say G, and the tail remains, so now the body includes the previous head position? Let's think.\n\nIn terms of positions: at start of turn, positions [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nAfter move, if no food, head moves to new position N, then positions become [N, H, B1, B2, ..., ] and tail T is removed, so [N, H, B1, ..., Bk] where Bk was the one before T.\n\nIf head moves to food F, then it eats, so positions become [F, H, B1, B2, ..., T], and tail T remains, so length increases; the new tail is still T, but the segment count increased.\n\nFor example, suppose snake of length 2: positions [(1,1), (1,2)] head at (1,1), tail at (1,2). Move left to (0,1), but assume no wall. If no food, new positions [(0,1), (1,1)], tail (1,1) or something. Better to index.\n\nInitial: head H, tail T. After move to empty cell: new head N, new body [H, ... up to the second last], tail removed. So positions shift.\n\nIf move to food: new head F, new body [H, ... all previous including tail], so tail is still there, and new segment added at head.\n\nIn this case, after eating, the tail position doesn't change immediately; it will move later when not eating.\n\nBut for collision, after moving to food, the head is at F, and the body includes all previous positions, so if F was part of body, it would collide, but food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away first.\n\nIn this case, (1,5) is not body, so moving there is fine.\n\nBut Tail Reward Danger: when eating food that is at the tail position, and head is adjacent to tail.\n\nHere, food is at (1,5), not at tail. Tail is at (3,3).\n\nSo for (1,5) food, no issue.\n\nNow, other moves from (1,4):\n- U: (1,5) - has food, value +1\n- D: (1,3) - but (1,3) is part of the body! Snake positions: (1,4) head, then (1,3) is the first body segment. So moving down to (1,3) would cause collision with body, death.\n\nCannot move down.\n\n- L: left to (0,4) - but x=0 is wall, so collision with wall, death.\n\n- R: right to (2,4) - is (2,4) free? Let's see if occupied.\n\nSnake positions: all positions listed: (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3)\n\n(2,4) not in list, and not wall, not obstacle. Internal obstacle only (4,6), so (2,4) is free. No food there.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (1,5) with food, or R to (2,4) empty.\n\nCannot move D or L.\n\nNow, direction is U, so moving down would be reverse, but since D is invalid anyway, no issue with reverse move.\n\nReverse move: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn, but here we are choosing the next move.\n\nCurrent direction is U, so from U, possible moves: U, L, R, but not D, because D is opposite.\n\nThe rule: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nSo from current direction U, I cannot choose D for the next move.\n\nBut in this case, D is invalid anyway, so only U, L, R possible in terms of direction, but L is to (0,4) wall, so invalid, so only U and R are valid moves: U to (1,5) or R to (2,4).\n\nNow, I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nFirst, if I go U to (1,5), I eat the food. Then snake grows, so new length is current 14 +1 = 15 segments? Count positions: 14 positions listed, so length 14, after eating, length 15.\n\nAfter move to (1,5), positions become: head at (1,5), then (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) — tail still at (3,3).\n\nNow, at this point, head at (1,5), direction was U, so now direction is U.\n\nFrom (1,5), possible moves:\n- U: to (1,6) - y=6, which is not y=7? y=7 is wall, y=6 is within 1 to 6? y=0 and y=7 walls, so y from 1 to 6 inclusive? (1,6): y=6, which is not wall, since y=7 is wall, so (1,6) is playable. Is it occupied? Not in snake positions, and no wall, no obstacle except (4,6), so free. No food.\n\n- D: to (1,4) - but (1,4) is now the second segment, body, so collision if move there.\n\n- L: to (0,5) - x=0 wall, death.\n\n- R: to (2,5) - not occupied, no wall, free. No food.\n\nAlso, cannot move D because opposite to current direction? Current direction after moving U is U, so moving D would be reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo from (1,5) after moving U, possible moves: U to (1,6), or R to (2,5), or L but L invalid, D invalid and not allowed.\n\nL is invalid anyway.\n\nSo U or R.\n\nIf I go U to (1,6), then head at (1,6). Then from there, possible moves: U to (1,7) but y=7 wall, death; D to (1,5) which is body; L to (0,6) wall; R to (2,6). So only R to (2,6) possible? (2,6) should be free.\n\nBut (2,6) might be near other things.\n\nSimilarly, if from (1,5) I go R to (2,5), then head at (2,5), direction R? From (1,5) to (2,5) is right, so direction R.\n\nThen from (2,5), moves: U to (2,6), D to (2,4), L to (1,5) which is body now? Positions: after moving to (2,5), head at (2,5), then (1,5), (1,4), etc. so (1,5) is body, so moving L to (1,5) collision. R to (3,5), etc.\n\nBut let's not get ahead; I need to think 5+ turns.\n\nBack to current turn 61.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (1,5), eat food, score +1, length 15.\n\nThen head at (1,5).\n\nThen I need to move from there.\n\nSince (1,5) is at y=5, and walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is available.\n\nFrom (1,5), I can go U to (1,6) or R to (2,5).\n\nIf I go U to (1,6), then at (1,6), I can only go R to (2,6), because U to (1,7) wall, D to (1,5) body, L wall.\n\nThen from (2,6), I can go U to (2,7) wall, D to (2,5), L to (1,6), R to (3,6).\n\nL to (1,6) is body, since previous position, so collision if I move back immediately? After moving to (2,6), positions: head (2,6), then (1,6), (1,5), etc. so (1,6) is body, so moving L to (1,6) would be collision.\n\nSimilarly, D to (2,5): (2,5) might be body or not.\n\nAssume I moved from (1,5) U to (1,6), then from (1,6) R to (2,6).\n\nNow positions: head at (2,6), body: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), ... up to tail (3,3).\n\nFrom (2,6), possible moves:\n- U to (2,7) wall, invalid\n- D to (2,5) - is (2,5) occupied? In current positions, after move to (2,6), the body includes (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), ... but (2,5) is not in the list yet. Before moving to (2,6), positions were [ (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), ... ] with head (1,6) before move? Let's sequence.\n\nTurn 61: move U to (1,5), positions: head (1,5), body (1,4), (1,3), ..., tail (3,3)\n\nTurn 62: move U to (1,6), positions: head (1,6), body (1,5), (1,4), ..., tail (3,3)\n\nTurn 63: move R to (2,6), positions: head (2,6), body (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), ..., (3,3) — tail still (3,3) since no food eaten, so on turn 63, when moving to (2,6), no food, so tail moves? When moving to empty cell, tail is removed.\n\nAt turn 63, after moving to (2,6), since (2,6) has no food (assuming), so positions: new head (2,6), previous head (1,6) becomes first body, and tail (3,3) is removed, so positions: [ (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) ] since tail (3,3) removed, and (3,2) was before, but let's list: original positions minus tail, plus new head.\n\nOriginal length 14, after eating at turn 61, length 15. At turn 62, moving to (1,6), no food, so tail should move. When moving to empty cell, the tail is removed, so length decreases? No.\n\nStandard snake mechanics: when moving to a cell without food, the head moves to new cell, the tail is removed, so length stays the same.\n\nWhen moving to food, head moves to food, tail is not removed, so length increases.\n\nAt turn 61: move to (1,5) with food, so positions: head (1,5), then all previous positions including tail, so length 15: (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3)\n\nTail at (3,3)\n\nTurn 62: move to (1,6), no food there, so head moves to (1,6), tail is removed, so positions: head (1,6), then (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) — and (3,3) removed, so tail at (3,2), length 14 again? No, after eating, length increased to 15, then when moving to empty, tail removed, so back to 14.\n\nPositions: after turn 61 move to food: 15 positions.\n\nAfter turn 62 move to (1,6) no food: new head (1,6), body from (1,5) to (3,2), which is 14 segments? List: new head (1,6), then previous positions from (1,5) to (3,3) minus tail? Previous positions were [ (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) ] so 15 cells.\n\nAfter moving head to (1,6), new positions: [ (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) ] and (3,3) is removed, so tail is (3,2), and the segment (3,3) is gone, so length is 15? [ (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) ] that's 15 positions, yes, because we added (1,6) and removed (3,3), but (3,3) was the last, so new last is (3,2).\n\nFrom 15 positions, moving to new cell without food: we add new head and remove tail, so new length same, 15 positions.\n\nIn this case, after turn 62, positions: head (1,6), body (1,5) to (3,2), with tail (3,2)? Positions: [ (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) ] so tail is (3,2).\n\nThen turn 63: move R to (2,6), no food, so new head (2,6), new positions: [ (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2) ] and tail (3,2) removed, so tail is (4,2), length 14? Let's count: 15 positions before move, after move to (2,6) no food, add (2,6), remove tail (3,2), so positions [ (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2) ] that's 15 positions, tail at (4,2).\n\nI think I confused myself. When snake moves to empty cell, the head moves to new position, and the tail position is removed, so the body segments shift, but the number of segments remains the same. Only when eating food, the tail is not removed, so segments increase.\n\nIn this case, after turn 61 ate food, length 15. Turn 62 moved to empty (1,6), so length 15, tail removed, but the removed cell is the old tail, so new tail is the one before.\n\nSimilarly, turn 63 move to (2,6) empty, length 15, tail removed, new tail is (5,2) or something.\n\nBut for planning, I need to know available cells.\n\nBack to decision at turn 61.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (1,5), eat food, then from there, I can go U to (1,6) or R to (2,5).\n\nIf I go U to (1,6), I'm at the top row y=6, and only can go right to (2,6), then from (2,6), I can go down to (2,5) or right to (3,6), etc.\n\nBut there is food at (4,5) and (4,3), so I might want to go towards them.\n\nIf from (1,5) I go R to (2,5), then I'm at (2,5), which is closer to the other foods.\n\nOption 2 at turn 61: Move R to (2,4) empty.\n\nThen head at (2,4), direction R (since moved right).\n\nFrom (2,4), possible moves:\n- U: (2,5) - free? Not occupied, no food mentioned.\n- D: (2,3) - free?\n- L: (1,4) - but (1,4) is body, collision\n- R: (3,4) - free?\n\nAlso, current direction R, so cannot move L (opposite), but L is invalid anyway.\n\nSo U, D, R possible.\n\n(2,5) should be free, (2,3) free, (3,4) free.\n\nNow, food at (4,3) and (4,5), both with longer life span.\n\nI need to think about long-term survival and getting to other food.\n\nAlso, the snake body is mostly on the bottom and left, so the right and top are more open.\n\nLet's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid 1 to 6 in x and y.\n\nWalls: borders and (4,6) obstacle.\n\nSnake positions: head (1,4), then down to (1,1), right to (6,1), up to (6,2), left to (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), then to (3,3).\n\nSo the body occupies: column x=1 from y=1 to 4, then row y=1 from x=1 to 6, then (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3).\n\nSo (2,2) is empty? Positions: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), etc., but (2,2) not listed, so free. Similarly, (2,3), (2,4) free, (3,4) free, etc.\n\nFood at (1,5), (4,3), (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is near the obstacle (4,6), so need to be careful.\n\nLife span: (1,5) has short life, only 5 turns, so if I don't eat it soon, it disappears. Turns 61-65.\n\n(4,3) life span 7, turns 61-67.\n\n(4,5) life span 10, turns 61-70.\n\nSo (1,5) is urgent.\n\nIf I don't eat it now, it might be gone.\n\nBut is it safe to eat?\n\nFrom (1,4), if I move R to (2,4), then from there I can go up to (2,5), but (1,5) is still there, and I can move to (1,5) from (2,5)? From (2,5), I can move L to (1,5), if it's still there.\n\nBut after moving to (2,4) on turn 61, on turn 62, I could go U to (2,5), then on turn 63, from (2,5) I could go L to (1,5) to eat it, if life span allows.\n\nTurn 61: move R to (2,4), head at (2,4), direction R.\n\nTurn 62: from (2,4), I can move U to (2,5), which is free, no food.\n\nThen head at (2,5), direction U (since moved up).\n\nThen turn 63: from (2,5), I can move L to (1,5), which has food, if still available. Life span of (1,5) is 5 at turn 61, so turn 62: life span 4, turn 63: life span 3, so on turn 63 it is still there.\n\nSo I can eat it on turn 63.\n\nBut on turn 63, when I move to (1,5), is it safe?\n\nAt that time, where is the body?\n\nTurn 61: start positions, move R to (2,4). No food, so positions: new head (2,4), body (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) — tail (3,3) removed? When moving to (2,4) no food, so tail removed.\n\nInitial positions: 14 segments.\n\nAfter move to (2,4) empty: new head (2,4), then previous positions from (1,4) to (3,3) minus tail (3,3), so body from (1,4) to (3,2)? Previous positions: [ (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) ]\n\nAfter move: head (2,4), then (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) — and (3,3) removed, so tail at (3,2), length 14.\n\nTurn 62: move U to (2,5), no food, so new head (2,5), body: (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) — tail (3,2) removed? Add (2,5), remove tail (3,2), so positions: [ (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2) ] tail at (4,2)\n\nTurn 63: move L to (1,5), which has food, so eat it. New head (1,5), body: (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2) and tail not removed, so length 15, tail still (4,2)? Positions: [ (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2) ] yes, tail at (4,2)\n\nNow, is there Tail Reward Danger? Head at (1,5), tail at (4,2). Are they adjacent? (1,5) and (4,2), x diff 3, y diff 3, not adjacent. So safe.\n\nBut in this case, I ate the food on turn 63 instead of turn 61, so I get the score later, but I have more time to think about other moves.\n\nHowever, by delaying, I risk the food disappearing or other issues, but life span is ok.\n\nBut in this path, I ended up at (1,5) on turn 63, which is similar to going directly on turn 61, but with the body in different positions.\n\nIf I go directly to (1,5) on turn 61, I get the score immediately, and I'm at (1,5) earlier.\n\nFrom there, I can go towards other food.\n\nIf I go R first to (2,4), I might have more flexibility.\n\nBut let's consider the other food.\n\nFood at (4,3) and (4,5).\n\n(4,5) has life span 10, so plenty of time, but (4,3) has 7 turns.\n\nThere is an obstacle at (4,6), so (4,5) is below it.\n\nTo reach (4,5), from the left or right.\n\nSimilarly for (4,3).\n\nNow, the snake tail is around (4,2) or something.\n\nAnother thing: the area around (3,3) to (3,2) is body, and (4,2) etc.\n\nTo reach (4,3), I can go from current position.\n\nBut let's think 5 turns ahead from turn 61.\n\nFirst, prioritize long-term survival. The grid has walls, and the snake is long, so I need space to move.\n\nCurrently, the bottom row y=1 is almost full with snake body from x=1 to 6, so it's crowded there.\n\nLeft column x=1 has body from y=1 to 4.\n\nThe top and right are more open.\n\nFor example, cells like (2,5), (3,5), (4,4), (5,3), etc. are free.\n\nFood at (4,3) and (4,5) are in column x=4.\n\n(4,3) is at y=3, (4,5) at y=5.\n\nObstacle at (4,6), so (4,5) is accessible, but moving up from (4,5) to (4,6) is blocked.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) is free.\n\nNow, if I eat the (1,5) food now, I might be trapped in the top-left corner.\n\nFor example, from (1,5), if I go U to (1,6), then only R to (2,6), then from (2,6), I can go D to (2,5) or R to (3,6), etc.\n\nIf I go to (2,6), then to (3,6), then I can go down to (3,5) or left to (2,6) body, etc.\n\nFrom (3,6), I can go D to (3,5), then to (3,4), etc.\n\nBut there is food at (4,5) and (4,3).\n\nSimilarly, if from (1,5) I go R to (2,5), then I can go to (3,5), etc.\n\nBut let's compare the two options at turn 61.\n\nOption A: Move U to (1,5) on turn 61.\n\nThen on turn 62, I need to move from (1,5). Suppose I go R to (2,5) to avoid the top row.\n\nTurn 62: from (1,5) move R to (2,5), no food there, so positions: head (2,5), body (1,5), (1,4), ..., tail (3,3) or whatever, but after eating on 61, tail at (3,3), then move to (2,5) no food, so tail removed, new tail (3,2) or something.\n\nAfter turn 61: positions [ (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3) ]\n\nTurn 62: move R to (2,5), no food, so new head (2,5), body [ (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) ] tail (3,3) removed, so tail at (3,2)? Body from (1,5) to (3,2), but (3,2) is included, tail is (3,2) after removal of (3,3).\n\nPositions: new head (2,5), then (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) — so 15 positions, tail at (3,2).\n\nThen from (2,5), I can go U to (2,6), D to (2,4), L to (1,5) body, R to (3,5).\n\nL to (1,5) is body, collision.\n\nCurrent direction after moving R is R, so cannot move L anyway.\n\nSo U, D, R possible.\n\n(2,6) free, (2,4) might be free or body? In positions, (2,4) not listed, so free. (3,5) free.\n\nSuppose I go R to (3,5) on turn 62? Turn 62 I moved to (2,5), then turn 63 move to (3,5).\n\n(3,5) no food, so move there.\n\nThen from (3,5), I can go to (4,5) which has food.\n\n(4,5) has food with life span 10, so on turn 63, it is there.\n\nIf I move to (3,5) on turn 63, then on turn 64 I can move to (4,5) to eat.\n\nBut let's not plan all, but think about risks.\n\nOption B: Move R to (2,4) on turn 61.\n\nThen as before, I can go to (2,5) on turn 62, then to (1,5) on turn 63 to eat.\n\nThen on turn 63, head at (1,5), similar to option A on turn 61.\n\nBut in option A, I eat on turn 61, in B on turn 63, so A gets the score earlier.\n\nBut in terms of position, after eating at (1,5), I am at (1,5) with the body.\n\nIn both cases, I end up near (1,5), but at different times.\n\nHowever, by going R first, I might have a better path to the other food.\n\nFor example, from (2,4) after turn 61 move, I could go directly towards (4,3) or (4,5).\n\nTurn 61 move R to (2,4).\n\nTurn 62, from (2,4), I could move U to (2,5), or D to (2,3), or R to (3,4).\n\nIf I go R to (3,4), then head at (3,4), then I can go to (4,4) or (3,3) but (3,3) might be body.\n\nAfter turn 61 move to (2,4), positions: [ (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) ] tail at (3,2)\n\nTurn 62 move R to (3,4), no food, so new head (3,4), body [ (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) ] tail removed? Add (3,4), remove tail (3,2), so positions: [ (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2) ] tail at (4,2)\n\nThen from (3,4), I can go U to (3,5), D to (3,3), L to (2,4) body, R to (4,4).\n\nL to (2,4) is body, collision.\n\nCurrent direction R, so cannot move L.\n\nSo U, D, R possible.\n\n(3,5) free, (3,3) free? (3,3) was tail before, but now not occupied. (4,4) free.\n\nThen I can go to (4,4) or (3,5).\n\nFrom (3,4), if I go R to (4,4), then to (4,5) or (4,3).\n\n(4,5) has food, (4,3) has food.\n\nBut (4,5) is at y=5, (4,3) at y=3.\n\nAlso, obstacle at (4,6), so from (4,5), I cannot go up.\n\nTo eat (4,5), I can move to (4,5) from (4,4) or (3,5) or (5,5).\n\nSimilarly for (4,3).\n\nNow, back to the decision.\n\nThe key point is that if I don't eat (1,5) now, it might be eaten later, but it has short life, so if I don't eat it within 5 turns, it's gone.\n\nBut in the path where I go R first, I can still eat it on turn 63, which is within life span.\n\nIf I go directly, I eat it now.\n\nBut there might be a risk with the Tail Reward Danger if I eat it later with different body positions, but in this case, it seems safe.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (1,5) is at the top-left, and the snake body is below, so after eating, I need to escape the area.\n\nIn the direct move, I eat and then I can move right.\n\nIn the delayed move, I eat later but am already moving right.\n\nPerhaps moving directly to the food is fine, but let's see if there is any immediate danger.\n\nFrom (1,4), moving U to (1,5) seems safe for now.\n\nBut after that, at (1,5), I am adjacent to the wall at x=0 and y=6, so only two moves, U or R.\n\nU leads to (1,6), which is a corner, only one move out, to (2,6).\n\nThen from (2,6), I have more options.\n\nBut it might be a bit restrictive.\n\nIf I move R first to (2,4), I am more central, and can go to (2,5) or (3,4), etc., giving more flexibility to reach other food.\n\nMoreover, the food at (4,3) and (4,5) are to the right, so moving right might be better for long-term.\n\nBut (1,5) is left, so I have to go back to eat it.\n\nBy moving R first, I can still eat (1,5) on turn 63, as I thought.\n\nBut let's check the life span: at turn 61, life span 5, so on turn 63, it is still there (life span 3 at start of turn 63).\n\nOn turn 63, when I move to (1,5), it is eaten.\n\nBut is (1,5) accessible? When I move to (2,5) on turn 62, (1,5) is not occupied by body yet? In the sequence:\n\nAfter turn 61 move to (2,4): positions [ (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) ] tail (3,2)\n\nTurn 62 move U to (2,5): new head (2,5), body [ (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) ] add (2,5), remove tail (3,2), so positions [ (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2) ] tail at (4,2)\n\nNow (1,5) is free and has food.\n\nTurn 63 move L to (1,5): eat food, so new head (1,5), body [ (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2) ] and tail not removed, so positions [ (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2) ] tail at (4,2)\n\nNo collision, and Tail Reward Danger not applicable since tail at (4,2) not adjacent to head (1,5).\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nBut now I am at (1,5), which is the same as if I had gone directly, but two turns later.\n\nIn terms of score, I get it on turn 63 instead of 61, but it's only a delay, not lost.\n\nHowever, by moving R first, on turn 61, I avoid the potential trap at (1,5) immediately, and I can start moving towards the center.\n\nMoreover, from (2,4), I have the option not to eat (1,5) if I don't want to, but since it's positive food, I should eat it before it disappears.\n\nBut with life span, I have until turn 65.\n\nSo another idea: perhaps I can go directly for the other food first, since (1,5) has time.\n\nFor example, from (2,4), I can go to (3,4), then to (4,4), then to (4,5) to eat.\n\nBut (4,5) has life span 10, so no rush.\n\nWhereas (1,5) has only 5 turns, so better to eat it soon.\n\nSo I think eating (1,5) within the next few turns is important.\n\nNow, for long-term survival, after eating (1,5), I need to have space to move.\n\nIf I eat it at turn 61, I am at (1,5) with the body trailing down and right, so moving right to (2,5) or up to (1,6) is possible.\n\nIf I eat at turn 63, I am at (1,5) with the body coming from (2,5), so similar.\n\nBut in the delayed case, when I move to (1,5) on turn 63, the body is at (2,5) and (2,4), so from (1,5), I can go U to (1,6) or R to (2,5) but (2,5) is body, so only U to (1,6) or if possible, but R to (2,5) collision, L wall, D to (1,4) which is body.\n\nFrom (1,5), after moving there on turn 63, positions: head (1,5), body (2,5), (2,4), etc., so (1,4) is body, (2,5) is body, so only U to (1,6) is possible, similar to the direct case.\n\nSo in both cases, after eating (1,5), I am forced to go U to (1,6) or if I had another way, but no.\n\nIn the direct case on turn 61, from (1,5) I can go R to (2,5) if it's free.\n\nIn turn 61 after eating, at (1,5), (2,5) is free, so I can go R to (2,5).\n\nIn the delayed case on turn 63, at (1,5), (2,5) is body, so I cannot go R, only U.\n\nThat's a difference.\n\nIn option A (direct U on turn 61): after eating at (1,5), on turn 62 I can go U to (1,6) or R to (2,5).\n\nIf I go R to (2,5), then I can continue to (3,5), etc.\n\nIn option B (R first on turn 61, then U to (2,5) on 62, then L to (1,5) on 63): after eating at (1,5) on turn 63, on turn 64 I can only go U to (1,6) because (2,5) is body and (1,4) is body.\n\nThen from (1,6), only R to (2,6), etc.\n\nSo in option B, after eating (1,5), I am forced to go up to the corner, which might be more dangerous.\n\nWhereas in option A, I can go directly right to (2,5) from (1,5) on turn 62, avoiding the corner.\n\nTherefore, it might be better to eat the food immediately on turn 61, then on turn 62 move R to (2,5), and then I can head towards the other food.\n\nMoreover, by eating now, I get the score and growth early, which might be beneficial for reaching other food with a longer body, but in this case, growth doesn't help directly, but more segments might make it harder to maneuver, but here the grid is small, so it might be tight.\n\nBut let's see the available space.\n\nAfter eating, length 15, grid has 6x6=36 cells, walls and obstacles reduce it.\n\nPlayable area: x1-6, y1-6, 36 cells, minus one obstacle at (4,6), so 35 cells.\n\nSnake length 15, so 20 free cells, plenty of space.\n\nSo not a problem.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should plan to eat all food.\n\nFood at (4,3) and (4,5) to eat.\n\nFrom current, if I go U on 61 to (1,5), eat.\n\nThen turn 62: move R to (2,5), no food, so positions update.\n\nThen from (2,5), turn 63: move R to (3,5), no food.\n\nThen turn 64: move to (4,5)? (4,5) has food, so move to (4,5) to eat.\n\nBut from (3,5), to (4,5) is right, possible.\n\nThen eat (4,5) on turn 64.\n\nThen head at (4,5), and I can go down to (4,4) or left to (3,5) body, etc.\n\nBut (4,3) is below, so I can go down.\n\nBut there is the obstacle at (4,6), so from (4,5), I can go D to (4,4), or L to (3,5) body, R to (5,5), U to (4,6) but (4,6) is obstacle, wall, so invalid.\n\nSo only D to (4,4) or R to (5,5).\n\nIf I go to (4,4), then to (4,3) to eat the other food.\n\nBut let's see if I can eat both.\n\nIn this path, I eat (1,5) on 61, then (4,5) on 64, and (4,3) later.\n\n(4,3) has life span 7, so on turn 64, life span 7-3=4? Turn 61: life span 7, turn 62:6, turn 63:5, turn 64:4, so available.\n\nSimilarly, if I go the other way.\n\nBut in option B, if I move R on 61 to (2,4), then on 62 to (3,4), for example, then on 63 to (4,4), then on 64 to (4,5) or (4,3).\n\nBut I need to eat (1,5) as well.\n\nIf I go directly to the right, I might miss (1,5).\n\nBut I can eat (1,5) on the way.\n\nSince (1,5) is time-sensitive, better to eat it soon.\n\nSo I think moving directly to (1,5) on turn 61 is acceptable, and then I can go right to (2,5), then to (3,5), etc.\n\nMoreover, to avoid the corner situation.\n\nTherefore, for turn 61, I should move U to (1,5).\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I can plan.\n\nBut the question is to output actions for multiple turns, at least from t1 to t1+ something, but the format says to output for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't specify how many, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide a sequence of a few turns.\n\nThe answer format is to box the actions for several turns.\n\nLet me decide the actions.\n\nAt turn 61, move U to (1,5) to eat food.\n\nThen turn 62, from (1,5), move R to (2,5) to avoid going up.\n\nThen turn 63, from (2,5), move R to (3,5) towards (4,5).\n\nThen turn 64, from (3,5), move R to (4,5) to eat the food there.\n\nThen turn 65, from (4,5), move D to (4,4) to go towards (4,3).\n\n(4,4) should be free.\n\nThen turn 66, from (4,4), move D to (4,3) to eat that food.\n\nBut need to check if safe and possible.\n\nFirst, turn 61: move U to (1,5), eat food, positions: head (1,5), body (1,4) to (3,3), length 15.\n\nTurn 62: move R to (2,5), no food, so new head (2,5), body (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) — tail (3,3) removed, new tail (3,2)? Positions: new head (2,5), then (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) — 15 positions, tail at (3,2).\n\n(3,3) is gone.\n\nTurn 63: move R to (3,5), no food? (3,5) should be free, no food mentioned, so move to (3,5), new head (3,5), body (2,5), (1,5), etc., minus tail (3,2), add (3,5), remove tail (3,2), so positions: [ (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2) ] tail at (4,2)\n\nTurn 64: move R to (4,5), which has food, so eat it. New head (4,5), body all previous including tail, so positions: [ (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2) ] and tail not removed, length 16, tail at (4,2)\n\nNow, from (4,5), possible moves: U to (4,6) but (4,6) is obstacle, wall, invalid. D to (4,4), L to (3,5) which is body, collision. R to (5,5).\n\nL is invalid and body, R to (5,5) should be free.\n\nCurrent direction after moving R to (4,5) is R, so cannot move L anyway.\n\nSo only D or R possible? U invalid, L invalid, so D to (4,4) or R to (5,5).\n\n(4,4) might be free, (5,5) free.\n\nBut we have food at (4,3), so better to go down.\n\nTurn 65: move D to (4,4), no food, so new head (4,4), body (4,5), (3,5), etc. minus tail (4,2), add (4,4), remove tail (4,2), so positions: [ (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2) ] tail at (5,2)? Body includes (5,2), but (4,2) removed.\n\nPositions: new head (4,4), then (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2) — 16 positions, tail at (5,2)\n\nTurn 66: move D to (4,3), which has food, so eat it. New head (4,3), body all, length 17.\n\nNow, all food eaten, and I can continue moving.\n\nIn this sequence, I ate all three foods: (1,5) on 61, (4,5) on 64, (4,3) on 66.\n\nLife spans: (1,5) eaten on 61, fine. (4,5) life span 10, eaten on 64, turn 64 - 61 =3, life span 10-3=7 left? At turn 61, life span 10, turn 62:9, turn 63:8, turn 64:7, so eaten on turn 64 with life span 7, fine. Similarly (4,3) at turn 61 life span 7, turn 66: 7-5=2? Turn 61:7, 62:6, 63:5, 64:4, 65:3, 66:2, eaten on turn 66, life span 2, fine.\n\nAnd no risks encountered.\n\nIf I had moved differently, it might not be as efficient.\n\nFor example, if I moved R first on turn 61, I might eat (1,5) later and miss the opportunity for (4,5) or something, but in this case, it worked.\n\nSo I think this is a good plan.\n\nTherefore, for the answer:\n\nTurn 61: U\n\nTurn 62: R\n\nTurn 63: R\n\nTurn 64: R  (to (4,5))\n\nBut on turn 64, moving to (4,5), which is R from (3,5), yes.\n\nThen turn 65: D\n\nTurn 66: D\n\nBut I don't need to specify beyond, but since I thought ahead, I can output a few turns.\n\nThe format says to output for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but doesn't say how many. Probably a sequence of actions.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", output 5 actions or so.\n\nt1=61, so turns 61 to 65 or 66.\n\nIn my sequence, actions: 61:U, 62:R, 63:R, 64:R, 65:D, 66:D but 66 is t1+5? t1=61, t1+1=62, ..., t1+5=66.\n\nt1+0=61, t1+1=62, etc.\n\nBut usually we start from t1.\n\nSo I can output from turn 61 to 65 or 66.\n\nBut in the sequence, on turn 64 I move to (4,5), turn 65 to (4,4), turn 66 to (4,3).\n\nPerhaps output up to turn 65.\n\nBut let's see the head direction.\n\nAfter turn 61 move U, direction U.\n\nTurn 62 move R, so direction changes to R.\n\nTurn 63 move R, still R.\n\nTurn 64 move R to (4,5), direction R.\n\nTurn 65 move D, which is down, opposite to R? Current direction R, moving D is down, which is not opposite to R; opposite would be L.\n\nDirections: U and D opposite, L and R opposite.\n\nR is right, D is down, not opposite, so allowed.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n</think>\nBased on the current state at turn \\(t_1 = 61\\), the snake head is at (1,4) with direction Up. The goal is to maximize score by eating all positive food while avoiding risks, with a focus on long-term survival over 5+ turns. The food at (1,5) has a short life span (5 turns, disappearing after turn 65) and should be prioritized. Moving directly Up to (1,5) on turn 61 eats this food immediately, gaining +1 score and increasing length. After eating, moving Right to (2,5) avoids the top-left corner and provides flexibility. Then, moving Right to (3,5) and (4,5) eats the food at (4,5) (life span 10, safe to eat by turn 64). Finally, moving Down to (4,4) positions the snake to eat the food at (4,3) on a subsequent turn (life span 7, safe to eat by turn 66).\n\n### Key Considerations for 5+ Turns Ahead:\n- **Immediate Food at (1,5)**: Must be eaten by turn 65. Eating on turn 61 is optimal to avoid missing it and to free up movement options.\n- **Path to (4,5) and (4,3)**: After eating (1,5), moving right and down provides a clear path to the other foods while avoiding dead ends. The obstacle at (4,6) blocks upward movement from (4,5), so moving down is necessary afterward.\n- **Collision Risks**: \n  - Moving Up to (1,5) is safe: no body collision, and Tail Reward Danger does not apply (tail at (3,3) not adjacent).\n  - Subsequent moves avoid walls, obstacles, and body segments (e.g., (4,6) is blocked, so no move Up from (4,5)).\n- **Direction Constraints**: \n  - Turn 61: Current direction Up, so Down is invalid (reverse) and also causes body collision. Left is a wall. Only Up or Right are valid; Up eats food.\n  - Turn 62: Direction is now Up after move to (1,5). Moving Down is invalid (reverse) and causes body collision. Left is wall. Only Up or Right valid; Right avoids corner.\n  - Later moves respect no-instant-reverse rule.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: \n  - Eating (1,5) early prevents loss of the food and allows the snake to move toward the center for more space.\n  - The sequence maintains access to open areas (e.g., after turn 62, the snake can maneuver freely toward (4,5) and (4,3)).\n  - Grid space is sufficient: 35 playable cells (6x6 minus walls and (4,6)), snake length 15 after eating (1,5), leaving 20 free cells.\n\n### Planned Actions (Turns 61 to 66):\n- **Turn 61**: Move Up (U) to (1,5) – eats positive food (+1 score, length +1).\n- **Turn 62**: Move Right (R) to (2,5) – avoids corner, positions for rightward movement.\n- **Turn 63**: Move Right (R) to (3,5) – moves toward (4,5).\n- **Turn 64**: Move Right (R) to (4,5) – eats positive food (+1 score, length +1).\n- **Turn 65**: Move Down (D) to (4,4) – avoids obstacle at (4,6) and heads toward (4,3).\n- **Turn 66**: Move Down (D) to (4,3) – eats positive food (+1 score, length +1; life span allows by turn 66).\n\nThis sequence eats all food safely within their life spans, maximizes score with minimal risk, and ensures the snake remains in open areas for future turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 61: U \\\\\nTurn 62: R \\\\\nTurn 63: R \\\\\nTurn 64: R \\\\\nTurn 65: D \\\\\nTurn 66: D\n}",

So currently moving upward.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (4,3) with life span 6 and value +1 (positive food)\n\n- (4,5) with life span 9 and value +1 (also positive food)\n\nBoth foods are positive, so eating them increases length by 1.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid to visualize. It's an 8x8 grid since borders are x=0 to 7 and y=0 to 7, so cells from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No.\n\nThe walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but the border cells are walls, meaning we can't move to them. So playable cells are x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? Let's confirm.\n\nIt says: \"Cells occupied by walls: Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" So any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. Also, internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSo the playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except where obstacles are.\n\n(4,6) is an obstacle, so we can't go there.\n\nNow, snake positions: head at (1,5), moving up. But (1,5) is at y=5, moving up would go to (1,6). y=6 is a border wall? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=6 should be playable? Let's see the y-range.\n\ny=0 is bottom wall, y=7 is top wall? Typically in grids, y=0 might be bottom or top; I need to clarify.\n\nIn the movement, U is (x,y+1), so increasing y is up. So y=0 is down, y=7 is up.\n\nBorder walls: x=0 left, x=7 right, y=0 bottom, y=7 top.\n\nSo for a point (x,y), moving U increases y to y+1, so if y=6, moving U to y=7 is a wall.\n\nSimilarly, moving D to y=0 wall, L to x=0 wall, R to x=7 wall.\n\nNow, current head at (1,5), direction U, so if it moves U, it goes to (1,6). y=6 is not a wall; walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable.\n\ny=7 is wall, so (1,6) is playable, (1,7) would be wall.\n\nSimilarly, x=0 and x=7 walls.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), so (4,6) is blocked.\n\nSnake body: let's list all occupied cells to avoid collisions.\n\nSnake positions:\n\n(1,5) - head\n\n(1,4)\n\n(1,3)\n\n(1,2)\n\n(1,1)\n\n(2,1)\n\n(3,1)\n\n(4,1)\n\n(5,1)\n\n(6,1)\n\n(6,2)\n\n(5,2)\n\n(4,2)\n\n(3,2)\n\n(3,3) - tail\n\nNow, the head is at (1,5), moving U to (1,6). Is (1,6) occupied? From the list, no. (1,6) is not in the positions, so it should be free.\n\nBut let's confirm the grid.\n\nFood: (4,3) and (4,5)\n\n(4,3) has life span 6, (4,5) has life span 9.\n\nCurrent turn t=62.\n\nLife span decreases each turn, including current, so after this turn, life_span for (4,3) will be 5, and (4,5) will be 8, and so on.\n\nBut since we're planning actions for multiple turns, we need to consider when food disappears.\n\nNow, head direction is U, so possible moves: since direction is U, we can move U, L, or R, but not D (down) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nCurrent direction is U, so opposite is D, so cannot move D next. Possible moves: U, L, R.\n\nNow, let's evaluate possible actions for turn 62.\n\nFirst, move options from (1,5):\n\n- U: to (1,6)\n\n- L: to (0,5) — but x=0 is wall, so invalid.\n\n- R: to (2,5)\n\n- D: invalid because reverse.\n\nSo only possible: U or R.\n\nU to (1,6) or R to (2,5).\n\nNow, need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, food at (4,3) and (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is at y=5, same as head y, but x=4.\n\nHead at (1,5), so (4,5) is to the right.\n\n(4,3) is below at y=3.\n\nNow, snake body: let's see what cells are occupied.\n\nFrom positions: (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3)\n\n(1,5) is head, but when we move, the head moves, and the tail may move if not eating.\n\nIf we don't eat food, tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail is freed.\n\nBut if we eat, tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n\nNow, for (1,6): is it free? From positions, no snake body there. Also, not a wall. Internal obstacle at (4,6), not (1,6). So (1,6) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5): is it occupied? (2,5) not in positions, so free.\n\nNow, but we need to consider future moves.\n\nAlso, the tail is at (3,3), and there's food at (4,3), which is adjacent? (4,3) is right of (3,3), but not on tail.\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut here, tail is at (3,3), no food on it. Food at (4,3) is separate.\n\nFood can be under body, but only eaten when body moves away and head moves on.\n\nHere, (4,3) has food, but is it under snake body? Snake positions: (4,1), (5,1), etc., not (4,3). (4,3) is not in positions, so it's free, not under body.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) is not in positions, free.\n\nSo both foods are accessible.\n\nNow, let's plan to eat one of them, but with long-term in mind.\n\nFirst, if we move U to (1,6) on turn 62.\n\nThen head at (1,6), direction U.\n\nPossible next moves: U, L, R. U to (1,7) but y=7 is wall, invalid. L to (0,6) x=0 wall, invalid. R to (2,6). So only R possible? U is invalid, L invalid, so only R to (2,6).\n\nIs that right? From (1,6), U to (1,7) wall, D to (1,5) but (1,5) is where body was, but after moving to (1,6), the body moves: when head moves to (1,6), the tail moves, so (1,5) becomes the new position for the segment that was head, but since we didn't eat, tail moves, so (3,3) is removed, and all segments shift.\n\nAfter move to (1,6), snake positions: head (1,6), then previous head (1,5) becomes body, so body: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) and tail was (3,3), but since no eat, tail moves off, so the last segment is now (3,2)? Let's trace.\n\nInitial positions: indices: 0: (1,5) head, 1: (1,4), 2: (1,3), 3: (1,2), 4: (1,1), 5: (2,1), 6: (3,1), 7: (4,1), 8: (5,1), 9: (6,1), 10: (6,2), 11: (5,2), 12: (4,2), 13: (3,2), 14: (3,3) tail.\n\nAfter moving head to (1,6) without eating, new positions: head (1,6), then body segments: the previous positions from 0 to 13 become the new body from index 1 to 14, but index 14 tail is removed? Standard snake movement: when head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail cell is vacated.\n\nSo new head: (1,6)\n\nThen segment 1: position of old head (1,5)\n\nSegment 2: old segment 1 (1,4)\n\n...\n\nSegment 15: old segment 14 (3,3)? But there are 15 segments, from 0 to 14.\n\nAfter move, snake has the same number of segments if no eat.\n\nNew positions:\n\nHead: new position (1,6)\n\nThen body: old positions from 0 to 13: (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2)\n\nOld tail (3,3) is removed, so no segment there.\n\nSo new tail is (3,2).\n\nPositions: [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2)]\n\nTail at (3,2).\n\nNow at (1,6), possible moves: U to (1,7) — y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nD to (1,5) — but (1,5) is now occupied by body segment, collision.\n\nL to (0,6) — x=0 wall, invalid.\n\nR to (2,6) — (2,6) is free? Not in positions, not wall, so possible.\n\nSo only possible move is R to (2,6).\n\nThen from (2,6), direction would be R (since we moved right).\n\nThen possible moves: U, D, L, R but no instant reverse, so since moved R, cannot move L (opposite).\n\nSo from (2,6), move R to (3,6)? Or U to (2,7) wall, or D to (2,5), etc.\n\n(2,7) y=7 wall, invalid. D to (2,5), L to (1,6) but (1,6) is body, collision, R to (3,6).\n\nSo possible: D to (2,5) or R to (3,6).\n\n(2,5) is free? Currently, positions after first move: (1,6), (1,5), etc., (2,5) not occupied, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) free.\n\nBut we need to think about food.\n\nIf we go to (2,6), then we can go down to (2,5) or right to (3,6).\n\n(2,5) might be a way to go towards food at (4,5) or (4,3).\n\nBut let's not get ahead; first for turn 62, if we move U, we are forced to move R on next turn to (2,6), and then we have options, but we might be cornered or something.\n\nSince moving U from (1,5) leads to only one possible move next, which is R to (2,6), and then from there we can go down or right, but it might be risky for long term because the area might be tight.\n\nNow, the other option at turn 62: move R to (2,5).\n\nFrom (1,5) move R to (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is free, as not in positions.\n\nThen head at (2,5), direction R (since moved right).\n\nThen possible next moves: from (2,5), since direction R, cannot move L (opposite), so can move U, D, R.\n\nU to (2,6), D to (2,4), R to (3,5).\n\nAll might be free currently.\n\n(2,6) free, (2,4) free? Positions: (1,4) is occupied, but (2,4) not, (3,5) not occupied.\n\nSo all possible.\n\nNow, from (2,5), we can head towards the foods.\n\nFood at (4,5) and (4,3).\n\n(4,5) is at same y=5, x=4.\n\nFrom (2,5), moving R to (3,5), then R to (4,5) would eat the food at (4,5).\n\n(4,5) has food, value +1, life span 9, so it will disappear at turn 62 + 9 - 1? Life span decreases each turn including current.\n\nAt turn 62, life_span=9 for (4,5), so after turn 62, it becomes 8, then 7, ..., disappears when life_span=0.\n\nSimilarly for (4,3), life_span=6 at turn 62.\n\nIf we eat at turn t, we consume it at that turn.\n\nBut to eat, head must move to that cell.\n\nNow, from head (1,5), if we move R to (2,5) on turn 62.\n\nThen on turn 63, from (2,5), we can move R to (3,5).\n\nThen on turn 64, from (3,5), move R to (4,5), which has food, so we eat it, length increases.\n\nBut is that safe? When we move to (4,5), the snake body: let's see where the tail is.\n\nFirst, current turn 62: move R to (2,5), no eat, so tail moves.\n\nInitial positions: head (1,5), body as above.\n\nAfter move to (2,5): new head (2,5), body: old head (1,5), then old segments 1 to 13: (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), and old tail (3,3) removed.\n\nNew positions: [(2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2)]\n\nTail at (3,2).\n\nNow turn 63: move R to (3,5). (3,5) is free? Not occupied, so yes.\n\nNew head (3,5), no eat yet? (3,5) no food, so no eat, tail moves.\n\nNew positions: head (3,5), body: old head (2,5), then old body except tail: so (1,5), (1,4), ..., up to (4,2), and (3,2) is tail, removed? Let's list.\n\nAfter move to (3,5): head (3,5), then previous positions: (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), and old tail (3,2) removed, so new tail is (4,2).\n\nPositions: [(3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2)]\n\nTail at (4,2).\n\nNow turn 64: move R to (4,5). (4,5) has food, so we eat it. Head to (4,5), and since eat, tail does not move, so new segment added.\n\nNew positions: head (4,5), then previous head (3,5), then the rest: (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), ..., (5,2), (4,2) — but since tail doesn't move, we add a new segment where tail was? No.\n\nWhen eating, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position, but since tail doesn't move, the snake grows.\n\nSo positions: new head (4,5), then the entire previous body: (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2) — and since we ate, we add a new segment at the position where tail was, but tail was at (4,2), so now it stays, and we have 16 segments.\n\nPrevious length 15, after eat, length 16.\n\nPositions: [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2)]\n\nHead at (4,5), tail at (4,2).\n\nNow, after eating at (4,5), we need to move on.\n\nBut we also have food at (4,3), which is below.\n\n(4,3) has life span 6, at turn 62, so at turn 64, life_span would be 4? Let's track.\n\nTurn 62: life_span (4,3) =6, (4,5)=9\n\nAfter turn 62: life_span (4,3)=5, (4,5)=8\n\nAfter turn 63: (4,3)=4, (4,5)=7\n\nAfter turn 64: (4,3)=3, (4,5) eaten, so gone.\n\nAt turn 64, we eat (4,5), so it's consumed.\n\n(4,3) still there with life_span=3 left.\n\nNow from (4,5), head direction R (since we moved right to get there).\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R. But no instant reverse, moved R, so cannot move L.\n\nSo can move U, D, R.\n\nU to (4,6) — but (4,6) is internal obstacle, wall! So invalid.\n\nD to (4,4) — (4,4) free? Not occupied, probably free.\n\nR to (5,5) — (5,5) free? Not occupied.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (4,4) or R to (5,5).\n\nNow, if we go down to (4,4), we can then go to (4,3) to eat the other food.\n\n(4,3) is below.\n\nFrom (4,4) to (4,3) is down.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach it.\n\nFirst, back to turn 62 decision.\n\nIf we move U at turn 62, we go to (1,6), then forced to R to (2,6) on turn 63.\n\nThen from (2,6), we can move, say, D to (2,5) or R to (3,6), etc., but we might not reach the food in time.\n\n(4,5) life span 9, so it has until turn 62+9-1=70? Life span decreases each turn, starting from turn 62.\n\nAt turn t, life_span = L, it disappears after L turns, meaning at the beginning of turn t+L, it might be gone? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn t, with life_span N, after that turn, it becomes N-1, and so on, until N=0, it disappears.\n\nSo for (4,5), life_span=9 at turn 62, so after turn 62, it becomes 8; after turn 63, 7; ... after turn 70, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 62 to 70 inclusive? At turn 70, if we move to it, life_span=1, we eat it, then after turn it becomes 0 and disappears, but we ate it.\n\nIf we move to a food cell on turn t, and at that turn life_span >0, we eat it.\n\nAfter eating, it's gone.\n\nSo (4,5) can be eaten as long as life_span >=1 when we move to it, i.e., from turn 62 to turn 62+8 = 70? At turn t, life_span = N, it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1.\n\nBecause at turn t+N-1, life_span=1, we eat, then after turn, it would be 0, but since eaten, gone.\n\nAt turn t+N, life_span=0, already gone.\n\nSimilarly for (4,3): life_span=6 at turn 62, can be eaten from turn 62 to 67.\n\nTurn 62 to 62+5=67, since at turn 67, life_span=1, can eat.\n\nAt turn 68, life_span=0, gone.\n\nNow, back to planning.\n\nIf we go for (4,5) directly by moving R at turn 62, we eat it at turn 64 as above.\n\nThen we are at (4,5) with direction R.\n\nFrom there, we can move D to (4,4) on turn 65.\n\nThen from (4,4), move D to (4,3) on turn 66 to eat the other food at (4,3).\n\nIs (4,3) still there? At turn 66, life_span of (4,3): started at 6 turn 62, after 62:5, 63:4, 64:3, 65:2, 66:1, so at turn 66, life_span=1, we can eat it.\n\nThen we eat both foods, good.\n\nBut is this path safe?\n\nAt turn 65, from (4,5) to (4,4), direction D.\n\nThen turn 66, from (4,4) to (4,3), direction D, eat food.\n\nAfter eating at (4,3), head at (4,3), and snake has grown.\n\nBut we need to consider the body positions to avoid collision.\n\nAfter eating at (4,5) on turn 64, positions: head (4,5), body: (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2) — tail at (4,2)\n\nThen turn 65: move D to (4,4). (4,4) is free, no eat, so tail moves.\n\nNew head (4,4), body: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2) — tail was (4,2), removed, so new tail is (5,2).\n\nPositions: [(4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2)]\n\nTail at (5,2).\n\nThen turn 66: move D to (4,3). (4,3) has food, so eat. Head to (4,3), tail does not move, so new segment added at tail position (5,2).\n\nNew positions: head (4,3), then previous body: (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), ..., (6,2), (5,2) and add new segment at (5,2)? No.\n\nPrevious body includes (5,2), and since eat, we add a new segment at the end, so tail stays.\n\nPositions: [(4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2)] — 17 segments, tail at (5,2).\n\nNow, head at (4,3), direction D (since moved down).\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R. But moved D, so cannot move U (reverse).\n\nCan move D, L, R.\n\nD to (4,2) — but (4,2) is occupied? In positions, (4,2) is not in the list above. Current positions: head (4,3), then (4,4), (4,5), ... down to (5,2). (4,2) is not there; earlier (4,2) was tail but moved off.\n\nIn turn 65, when we moved to (4,4), tail (4,2) was removed, so (4,2) is free now? Let's see turn 65 positions: after move to (4,4), positions: [(4,4), (4,5), (3,5), ..., (6,2), (5,2)] so (4,2) not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) should be free.\n\nBut (4,2) was part of the body earlier, but now vacated.\n\nSo D to (4,2) is possible? (4,2) is at y=2, moving down to (4,2) would be decreasing y? y=3 to y=2 is down, yes.\n\nU to (4,4) but (4,4) is occupied by body, collision.\n\nL to (3,3), R to (5,3), etc.\n\nBut from (4,3), move D to (4,2): (4,2) is free? Yes.\n\nBut after eating at (4,3), we are at (4,3), move D to (4,2).\n\n(4,2) might be free, but let's see the state.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 66, after eating at (4,3), positions as above.\n\nThen turn 67: move from (4,3) to, say, (4,2) or other.\n\nBut (4,2) is free now, since vacated.\n\nSimilarly, other directions.\n\nBut we need to think beyond eating both foods.\n\nAfter eating both, we have a longer snake, and we need to survive.\n\nBut also, there might be risks.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (4,6), which we avoided.\n\nNow, back to turn 62, if we move U to (1,6), what happens?\n\nTurn 62: move U to (1,6), no eat.\n\nPositions: head (1,6), body: (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) — tail at (3,2) since (3,3) removed.\n\nTurn 63: only possible move R to (2,6), as U and L invalid, D to (1,5) occupied.\n\nMove to (2,6), direction R.\n\nNo eat, so tail moves: new head (2,6), body: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), ..., (4,2), (3,2) — old tail (3,2) removed? After move, positions: head (2,6), then (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2) — tail at (4,2).\n\nNow at (2,6), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,7) wall, invalid. D to (2,5), L to (1,6) occupied, R to (3,6). So only R to (3,6) possible? D to (2,5) is possible? (2,5) is free? Not occupied, yes.\n\n(2,5) not in positions, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) free.\n\nSo can move D to (2,5) or R to (3,6).\n\nIf we move R to (3,6), then to (4,6) but (4,6) obstacle, invalid, or to (3,7) wall, or D to (3,5), etc.\n\nBut (4,5) food is at (4,5), which we might reach.\n\nBut from (2,6), moving R to (3,6) or D to (2,5).\n\nIf we go to (2,5), then we can go towards (4,5) as before.\n\nBut it takes more turns.\n\nFor example, from (2,6) move D to (2,5) on turn 64.\n\nThen from (2,5) move R to (3,5) on turn 65, then to (4,5) on turn 66 to eat.\n\nAt turn 66, (4,5) life_span: started 9 turn 62, after 62:8,63:7,64:6,65:5,66:4, so yes, can eat.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) can be eaten until turn 67.\n\nBut we might eat both later.\n\nHowever, by moving U first, we waste a turn going up, and we might have fewer options.\n\nWhereas moving R directly at turn 62 gets us to the food faster and allows us to eat both.\n\nMoreover, in the R path, after eating both, we are at (4,3) with direction D, and we can move to (4,2) or (5,3), etc., and the tail is at (5,2), so we have space.\n\nFor example, from (4,3) after eating, we can move R to (5,3), then to (6,3), etc., or down to (4,2), but (4,2) might be free.\n\nIn the sequence, when we move to (4,2) from (4,3), it should be free.\n\nBut we need to think about long-term survival.\n\nThe grid has walls and obstacles, and snake is long.\n\nAfter eating both, snake has 17 segments, and playable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to6, minus (4,6) obstacle, so 6x6 -1 = 35 cells, but snake 17, so space is ok, but we need to avoid dead ends.\n\nIn the R path, we are moving right and down, and the body is mostly on the left and bottom, so we have space on the right and top.\n\nFor example, after being at (4,3), we can move R to (5,3), then to (6,3), then U to (6,4), etc., and avoid colliding.\n\nWhereas if we go U first, we end up at (2,6) or (3,6), which is near the top, and the food at (4,5) might be eaten, but (4,3) might expire if we don't go down.\n\n(4,3) life span only 6, so by turn 67 it's gone.\n\nIf we go U at turn 62, eat (4,5) at turn 66, then to go to (4,3) we need to go down, but at turn 66, (4,3) life_span=1? Turn 62:6, 63:5, 64:4, 65:3, 66:2, 67:1, so at turn 67 can eat, but if we eat (4,5) at turn 66, then at turn 67 we are at (4,5), need to go to (4,3), but (4,4) might be free, move D to (4,4) turn 67, then D to (4,3) turn 68, but at turn 68, (4,3) life_span=0, gone, so we miss it.\n\nLet's calculate:\n\n(4,3) life_span at turn 62:6\n\nTurn 63:5\n\nTurn 64:4\n\nTurn 65:3\n\nTurn 66:2\n\nTurn 67:1\n\nTurn 68:0, disappeared.\n\nIf we eat at (4,5) on turn 66, we are at (4,5) on turn 66.\n\nThen turn 67: move to (4,4) or other.\n\nIf move D to (4,4), then turn 68: move to (4,3), but on turn 68, (4,3) is gone, so cannot eat.\n\nIf we move directly down from (4,5) to (4,4) on turn 67, then to (4,3) on turn 68, but too late.\n\nFrom (4,5) on turn 66, we could move D to (4,4) on turn 67? Turn 66 we are at (4,5) after eating.\n\nThen turn 67: from (4,5) move D to (4,4), then turn 68 move to (4,3), but (4,3) gone.\n\nTo eat (4,3) we must be on (4,3) by turn 67 at latest.\n\nBut on turn 67, if we are not at (4,3), we miss it.\n\nIn the U-first path, when we eat (4,5) on turn 66 at (4,5), we are at (4,5) on turn 66 end.\n\nThen on turn 67, we need to be at (4,3), but (4,3) is two steps away: (4,5) to (4,4) to (4,3), but we can only move one step per turn.\n\nSo on turn 67, we move to (4,4), not to (4,3), so on turn 67, we are at (4,4), and (4,3) has life_span=1, we are not on it, so we don't eat it.\n\nThen on turn 68, we move to (4,3), but (4,3) is gone.\n\nSo we miss the food at (4,3).\n\nTherefore, by going U first, we can only eat one food, whereas by going R first, we can eat both.\n\nMoreover, going R first seems safer and more efficient.\n\nBut in the R path, when we move to (4,3) to eat, is there any risk?\n\nAlso, after that, we need to survive.\n\nBut since both foods are positive, eating both is better.\n\nNow, what about the other option at turn 62? Only U or R, since L and D invalid.\n\nD is invalid because reverse.\n\nSo choices are U or R.\n\nR is better.\n\nBut let's confirm the head direction.\n\nCurrent head at (1,5), direction U.\n\nIf we move R, direction changes to R.\n\nIn the sequence, no problem.\n\nPerhaps we can consider not going for food immediately, but since foods are positive, and we can eat both, it's good.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nThe user said \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"maximize score\", so we should plan the actions.\n\nSince the situation might change, we can plan a sequence.\n\nTurn 62: move R to (2,5)\n\nThen turn 63: from (2,5) move R to (3,5)\n\nTurn 64: from (3,5) move R to (4,5) and eat\n\nNow, after that, on turn 65, from (4,5) move D to (4,4)\n\nTurn 66: from (4,4) move D to (4,3) and eat\n\nNow, we have eaten both by turn 66.\n\nThen for turn 67, we are at (4,3) with direction D (since last move down).\n\nPossible moves: cannot move U (reverse), so D, L, R.\n\nD to (4,2), L to (3,3), R to (5,3)\n\nNow, we need to choose a safe move for survival.\n\n(4,2): let's see if occupied. In turn 66 after eating, positions include (4,2)? Earlier after eating at (4,3) on turn 66, positions: head (4,3), body: (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), ..., down to (5,2), so (4,2) not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3): not in positions, should be free.\n\n(5,3): free.\n\nNow, moving to (4,2) might be ok, but let's think long term.\n\nThe body is spread out, so we have space.\n\nFor example, we can move R to (5,3) to go towards the right side.\n\nThen from (5,3) to (6,3), etc.\n\nSince walls are borders, we need to avoid trapping ourselves.\n\nBut with 17 segments, grid has 36 cells minus walls? Playable cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, that's 6x6=36 cells.\n\nMinus obstacle (4,6), so 35 cells.\n\nSnake 17, so 18 free cells, plenty of space.\n\nWe can move around.\n\nFor instance, from (4,3) move R to (5,3) on turn 67.\n\nThen from (5,3) move R to (6,3) on turn 68.\n\nThen from (6,3) move U to (6,4) on turn 69, etc.\n\nBut we need to specify 5 turns or more.\n\nThe answer should be from turn t1=62 to, say, turn 66 or 67.\n\nBut since we need to think ahead, we can output up to when we eat the second food.\n\nBut the user says \"answer format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nAnd \"think 5+ turns ahead\", so probably for several turns.\n\nSince after eating both, we can just move safely.\n\nBut to be precise, let's list the actions.\n\nFirst, at turn 62, move R.\n\nThen turn 63: from (2,5), we move R to (3,5), as planned.\n\nBut from (2,5), we could move U or D, but to go to (3,5) directly is fine.\n\nSimilarly, no other food, so.\n\nThen turn 64: move R to (4,5) eat.\n\nTurn 65: move D to (4,4)\n\nTurn 66: move D to (4,3) eat.\n\nNow, for turn 67, we need to move from (4,3).\n\nAs above, move R to (5,3), for example.\n\nThen turn 68: from (5,3) move R to (6,3)\n\nTurn 69: from (6,3) move U to (6,4)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut since the food is gone, and no other food mentioned, we just survive.\n\nIn the state, only two foods, both eaten.\n\nSo for the answer, we can output up to turn 66 or 67.\n\nBut think 5 turns ahead: from turn 62, turns 62,63,64,65,66 is 5 turns.\n\nt1=62, so turns 62 to 66 is 5 actions? Turn 62,63,64,65,66: that's 5 turns.\n\nActions at turn 62,63,64,65,66.\n\nAt turn 66, we eat the second food.\n\nThen we can stop or continue.\n\nBut to show survival, we can add one more.\n\nSince the format might expect actions for multiple turns.\n\nNow, another thing: when we move to (4,5) on turn 64, is (4,5) free? Yes.\n\nAnd when we move to (4,3) on turn 66, similarly.\n\nIn the beginning, when we move R at turn 62, from (1,5) to (2,5), is (2,5) free? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, all moves seem safe.\n\nBut let's check if at any point the head is adjacent to tail with food on tail, but in this case, no food on tail cells.\n\nFor example, tail is at different positions.\n\nIn the sequence, tail is never with food when head adjacent, I think.\n\nSo the path seems good.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 62: R\n\nTurn 63: R (to (3,5))\n\nTurn 64: R (to (4,5), eat)\n\nTurn 65: D (to (4,4))\n\nTurn 66: D (to (4,3), eat)\n\nNow, for thinking ahead, we can add:\n\nTurn 67: R (to (5,3))\n\nBut not necessary, but to show.\n\nSince we need to output in the box.\n\nAnswer format: \\boxed{ Turn 62: R, Turn 63: R, Turn 64: R, Turn 65: D, Turn 66: D }\n\nBut we should specify the action, like \"R (right)\" or just \"R\"?\n\nIn the format, it says \"action ∈ {U (up), D (down), L (left), R (right)}\", so probably \"R\" or \"R (right)\", but in the box, perhaps just the letter.\n\nLook: \"action ∈ {U (up), D (down), L (left), R (right)}\" so we can use U, D, L, R.\n\nAnd in the box, list the turns.\n\nFor 5 turns: 62 to 66.\n\nt1=62, so turns 62,63,64,65,66.\n\nActions: R, R, R, D, D\n\nBut at turn 65, we move D to (4,4), which is fine.\n\nIs there a reason to do something else?\n\nSuppose at turn 62 we move U, but as we saw, we might miss one food, and it's less efficient.\n\nSo R is better.\n\nTherefore, the plan is to move right immediately to target the foods.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating both positive foods while ensuring long-term survival, I evaluated possible moves 5+ turns ahead. The key objectives are:\n- Eat the food at (4,5) before it disappears (life span 9, must be eaten by turn 70).\n- Eat the food at (4,3) before it disappears (life span 6, must be eaten by turn 67).\n- Avoid collisions with walls, obstacles, and the snake's body.\n- Prioritize a path that allows eating both foods efficiently and maintains open space for movement afterward.\n\n### Analysis of Turn 62 Options:\n- **Current head position**: (1,5), direction U (up).\n- **Possible moves**: \n  - U to (1,6): Only valid immediate move is R to (2,6) on next turn, leading to a constrained path. This delays reaching the foods and risks missing (4,3) due to its short life span.\n  - R to (2,5): Directly paths toward both foods. Allows eating (4,5) by turn 64 and (4,3) by turn 66, with minimal risk.\n\nMoving R at turn 62 is optimal because:\n- It reaches (4,5) in 3 turns (turn 64) and (4,3) in 5 turns (turn 66), within their life spans.\n- After eating, the snake can move safely rightward to open space (e.g., (5,3), (6,3)), avoiding dead ends.\n- The grid has 35 playable cells (6x6 minus obstacle at (4,6)), and after eating both foods, the snake length is 17, leaving 18 free cells—ample space for maneuvering.\n\n### Planned Actions (Turns 62–67):\n1. **Turn 62: R (right)** to (2,5).  \n   - Eats no food. New head direction: R.  \n   - Body shifts; tail (3,3) removed. Food life spans update: (4,3) life=5, (4,5) life=8.\n\n2. **Turn 63: R (right)** to (3,5).  \n   - Eats no food. New head direction: R.  \n   - Body shifts; tail (4,2) removed. Food life spans: (4,3) life=4, (4,5) life=7.\n\n3. **Turn 64: R (right)** to (4,5).  \n   - Eats positive food (+1 score, length increases to 16). New head direction: R.  \n   - Tail does not move; new segment added. Food (4,5) consumed. (4,3) life=3.\n\n4. **Turn 65: D (down)** to (4,4).  \n   - Eats no food. New head direction: D.  \n   - Body shifts; tail (5,2) removed. (4,3) life=2.\n\n5. **Turn 66: D (down)** to (4,3).  \n   - Eats positive food (+1 score, length increases to 17). New head direction: D.  \n   - Tail does not move; new segment added. Food (4,3) consumed.\n\n6. **Turn 67: R (right)** to (5,3).  \n   - Eats no food. New head direction: R.  \n   - Body shifts; tail (6,2) removed. No food left; focus on survival in open right-side space.\n\n### Why This Sequence?\n- **Efficiency**: Eats both foods by turn 66, maximizing score (+2 total).\n- **Safety**: \n  - No wall or obstacle collisions (e.g., avoids (4,6) obstacle).\n  - No body collisions: Path avoids occupied cells, and tail movements free space.\n  - No \"Tail Reward Danger\": Tail never has food when head is adjacent.\n- **Long-term survival**: \n  - After turn 66, moving right (e.g., to (5,3), (6,3), then up) keeps the snake in open areas with 18 free cells.\n  - The sequence avoids corners (e.g., top row) and ensures flexibility for future moves beyond turn 67.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 62: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 63: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 64: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 65: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 66: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 67: R (right)\n}",

        "step": 63,
        "score": 14,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 63, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (2,5), and the body segments follow: (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2). That's 15 segments, so the snake is 15 cells long.\n\nHead direction is right (R), meaning it's moving to the east.\n\nFood: there are two pieces:\n\n- At (4,3) with value 1 and life span 5. So it disappears after 5 turns, including the current turn. Since current turn is 63, it will disappear after turn 67? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So if life span is 5 at turn 63, after turn 63 it becomes 4, then 3 at turn 64, and so on, until it reaches 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 63 to 67, but not after that.\n\nSimilarly, food at (4,5) with value 1 and life span 8. So it lasts until turn 70 (63+7=70? Let's calculate: at turn 63, life span 8, so it decreases to 7 at turn 64, 6 at 65, ..., down to 0 at turn 70. Turn 63: 8, turn 64:7, turn 65:6, turn 66:5, turn 67:4, turn 68:3, turn 69:2, turn 70:1, turn 71:0 and disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 63 to 70.\n\nBoth foods have value +1, so they're positive food.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid is 8x8: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are borders, so cells like (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) are walls.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: let's list them in order:\n\nHead: (2,5)\n\nThen: (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2)\n\nSo the snake forms a sort of loop or path. From head (2,5) to (1,5) is left, then down to (1,4), down to (1,3), down to (1,2), down to (1,1), then right to (2,1), right to (3,1), right to (4,1), right to (5,1), right to (6,1), then up to (6,2)? (6,2) is up from (6,1), since y increases up? In the movement, U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, y-1 is down. So coordinates: (x,y), with y=0 bottom or top? Typically in such grids, y=0 is bottom, y=7 top, but in movement, U (up) is y+1, so higher y is up.\n\nIn the snake positions, head at (2,5), moving right. Then (1,5) is left of head, so that's the first body segment. Then (1,4) is below (1,5) since y=4 < y=5, so down. Similarly, (1,3) down, (1,2) down, (1,1) down. Then (2,1) is right of (1,1), so east. Then (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) all right. Then (6,2) is up from (6,1), so north. Then (5,2) is left of (6,2), west. Then (4,2), (3,2) left.\n\nNow, tail is (3,2).\n\nFood at (4,3) and (4,5).\n\n(4,3) is at x=4,y=3.\n\n(4,5) is at x=4,y=5.\n\nCurrent head position: (2,5), moving right.\n\nPossible moves: since head direction is R, I can move U, D, R, but not L (left) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. From moving right, I can go up, down, or continue right, but not left.\n\nRule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nCurrent direction is R, so opposite is L, so I cannot move left on this turn. I can move U, D, or R.\n\nNow, let's see what cells are safe to move to.\n\nFirst, for turn 63, head at (2,5), moving R.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U (up): to (2,6)\n\n- D (down): to (2,4)\n\n- R (right): to (3,5)\n\nNow, check for collisions:\n\n- Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So (2,6): y=6, which is not 7, so not wall. x=2, not 0 or 7. (2,4) similarly ok. (3,5) ok.\n\nInternal obstacle: (4,6), not affecting these.\n\nNow, body segments: snake positions are all occupied except that when I move, the tail might move, but I need to check if the cell is occupied by body at the time of move.\n\nWhen I move the head, the body follows, so the new head position must not be in the body segments except possibly the tail, because the tail will move away.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, only the tail cell is safe to move into, because it will move.\n\nCurrent tail is (3,2).\n\nNow, for move to (3,5): is (3,5) occupied by body?\n\nList of snake positions: (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2)\n\nIs (3,5) in this list? (3,5) is not listed, so no body there. Similarly, (2,6) not in list, (2,4) not in list. So all three moves are safe from collision at this turn.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nFood: there is food at (4,3) and (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is at y=5, x=4.\n\nCurrent head at (2,5), so same row, x=2 to x=4 is two steps right, but there might be obstacles.\n\nAlso, (4,3) is below.\n\nBut I need to consider the life span.\n\nFood at (4,3) life span 5, so must be eaten by turn 67.\n\nFood at (4,5) life span 8, by turn 70.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should aim for both if possible, but avoid risks.\n\nNow, the snake is long, 15 cells, so moving around might be tricky with the body.\n\nAlso, there's a special rule about food under body: food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves on.\n\nIn this case, food at (4,3) and (4,5), are they under the snake?\n\nLook at snake positions: (4,1), (4,2), but not (4,3) or (4,5). (4,3) is not occupied, (4,5) not occupied. So not under body.\n\n(4,1) and (4,2) are body, but (4,3) is empty, food there. Similarly (4,5) empty.\n\nSo both are accessible.\n\nNow, let's see the path to them.\n\nFirst, to reach (4,5): from (2,5), I can go right to (3,5), then to (4,5). That's two moves.\n\nBut after moving to (4,5), I eat the food, so snake grows to 16 cells, and the tail doesn't move that turn? When I eat food, the length increases, so the tail stays, meaning I add a new head position, and the tail remains for that turn.\n\nRule: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food. So when head moves to food cell, it eats, and the snake grows, so the tail does not move that turn. Next turn, when I move, the tail moves.\n\nStandard snake mechanics: when you eat, you grow, so on the turn you eat, the head moves to the food, and a new segment is added, so the tail stays in place. Next move, tail moves.\n\nIn terms of positions: suppose head at H, food at F. Move head to F, eat, so new head is F, and the body from previous head to tail remains, so the tail doesn't advance, so the snake is longer by one.\n\nThen next turn, when you move, tail moves.\n\nIn collision, when you eat, if the new head position is where tail was, it might be ok if tail moves, but since tail doesn't move when you eat, it could be a problem.\n\nSpecifically, \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because head and newly grown tail collide.\n\nIn this case, for (4,5), is it adjacent to tail?\n\nTail is at (3,2), which is far, so not adjacent. So eating (4,5) should be safe.\n\nSimilarly for (4,3).\n\nBut let's plan the moves.\n\nFirst, for turn 63, I need to choose action.\n\nOptions: U to (2,6), D to (2,4), R to (3,5).\n\nIf I go R to (3,5), then on turn 64, I can go to (4,5) to eat the food, assuming no issues.\n\nBut let's see what (3,5) is. Is it safe?\n\n(3,5) is not wall, not body, as per above.\n\nThen from (3,5), I can move to (4,5) to eat.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows, so positions: new head at (4,5), previous head (3,5) becomes body, and so on, tail at (3,2) remains since no move.\n\nThen on next turn, tail moves.\n\nBut I need to think further.\n\nThere is also food at (4,3) with shorter life span, only 5 turns, so I should prioritize that if possible, since it might disappear.\n\nLife span 5 at turn 63, so if not eaten by turn 67, it's gone.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) has longer life.\n\nBut (4,3) is closer? From (2,5), to (4,3): I need to go down then right or something.\n\n(4,3) is at x=4,y=3, head at (2,5), so Δx=2, Δy=-2, so I need to move down twice and right twice, but not necessarily.\n\nI could go down to (2,4), then to (3,4), etc., but (3,4) might be free? Let's see what cells are occupied.\n\nList all occupied cells by snake: from positions: (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2)\n\nSo the grid has these occupied, plus walls.\n\nFree cells: for example, (2,4) is free? (2,4) not in list, yes.\n\n(2,6) free.\n\n(3,5) free.\n\n(3,4) free? (3,4) not in list, yes.\n\n(3,3) free, (4,3) food, (4,4) free? (4,4) not in list, yes.\n\n(4,5) food.\n\n(5,3) etc.\n\nBut also, internal wall at (4,6), but that's not affecting directly.\n\nNow, back to turn 63.\n\nIf I move R to (3,5), then turn 64, I can move R to (4,5) and eat the food.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows, new length 16, head at (4,5).\n\nThen, from there, I can consider going to (4,3) or other places.\n\n(4,3) is two steps down from (4,5), but I need to move down to (4,4), then to (4,3), but (4,4) is free, as above.\n\nLife span of (4,3) is 5, at turn 63, so if I eat on turn 64 or 65, it should be fine.\n\nTurn 63: head moves to (3,5), no eat.\n\nTurn 64: move to (4,5), eat, grow to 16.\n\nThen turn 65: from (4,5), I can move D to (4,4), then turn 66 to (4,3) to eat, but (4,3) might disappear after turn 67, so turn 66 is fine.\n\nBut I need to check if moving to (4,4) is safe.\n\nOn turn 65, after eating on turn 64, positions: after turn 64, head moved to (4,5), ate, so new positions: head (4,5), then (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), ..., down to tail (3,2), but since grew, tail didn't move, so positions: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2) — 16 positions.\n\nTail is (3,2).\n\nNow on turn 65, I move down to (4,4). (4,4) is free, not body, not wall.\n\nThen positions: head to (4,4), body follows: (4,5), (3,5), etc., tail (4,2) or something? When I move, head to new position, each segment moves to previous position, so tail moves off (3,2).\n\nAfter move: head (4,4), then (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), ... up to (4,2) becomes the new tail? Let's trace: previous positions: index 0: (4,5), 1: (3,5), 2: (2,5), 3: (1,5), 4: (1,4), 5: (1,3), 6: (1,2), 7: (1,1), 8: (2,1), 9: (3,1), 10: (4,1), 11: (5,1), 12: (6,1), 13: (6,2), 14: (5,2), 15: (4,2) — tail is (4,2).\n\nAfter move down to (4,4), new head (4,4), then body: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), ..., (5,2), (4,2) but (4,2) was tail, now it moves to the position of the second last? Standard: when moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail leaves its position.\n\nSo positions after move: head (4,4), then segment 1: old head (4,5), segment 2: old seg1 (3,5), segment 3: old seg2 (2,5), ..., down to segment 15: old seg14 (5,2), and tail old seg15 (4,2) is left, so new tail is old seg14 (5,2)? Let's index.\n\nBefore move: positions: 0: head (4,5), 1: (3,5), 2: (2,5), 3: (1,5), 4: (1,4), 5: (1,3), 6: (1,2), 7: (1,1), 8: (2,1), 9: (3,1), 10: (4,1), 11: (5,1), 12: (6,1), 13: (6,2), 14: (5,2), 15: (4,2) tail.\n\nAfter move down to (4,4): new head at (4,4), then new segment 1: old head (4,5), new segment 2: old seg1 (3,5), new segment 3: old seg2 (2,5), ..., new segment 15: old seg14 (5,2), and old tail (4,2) is gone. So tail is now (5,2).\n\nPositions: (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2) — tail (5,2).\n\n(5,2) is the tail.\n\nThen turn 66, I can move down to (4,3) to eat the food.\n\n(4,3) is free, not body, not wall.\n\nEat, so grow to 17 cells.\n\nThen head at (4,3), etc.\n\nBut I need to see if this is possible with the life span.\n\nTurn 63: move to (3,5)\n\nTurn 64: move to (4,5), eat, grow to 16\n\nTurn 65: move to (4,4)\n\nTurn 66: move to (4,3), eat, grow to 17\n\nFood at (4,3) has life span 5 at turn 63, so after turn 63, it becomes 4, turn 64:3, turn 65:2, turn 66:1, turn 67:0 disappear.\n\nAt turn 66, when I move to (4,3), it is still there, life span 1, I eat it before it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) eaten at turn 64.\n\nBut on turn 65, I moved to (4,4), which is empty, no food.\n\nNow, is there any risk?\n\nWhen I eat (4,5) at turn 64, head at (4,5), and tail was at (3,2), far away, not adjacent, so no tail reward danger.\n\nSimilarly for (4,3).\n\nBut after eating both, the snake is longer, and I need to survive.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (4,6), which is above (4,5).\n\n(4,6) is wall, so I cannot go up from (4,5) to (4,6).\n\nIn my plan, after eating (4,5), I go down to (4,4), then (4,3).\n\nFrom (4,3), where to go?\n\n(4,3) has walls: left is x=0, but (3,3) might be free, etc.\n\nBut I need to think beyond.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if moving to (3,5) on turn 63 is safe.\n\n(3,5) is free, no issue.\n\nBut let's see other options.\n\nIf I move D to (2,4) on turn 63.\n\nThen head to (2,4), which is free.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (3,4) or (2,3) or (2,5), but (2,5) is where body was, but after move, (2,5) is now the first body segment.\n\nAfter move to (2,4), positions: head (2,4), then (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), ... down to tail (3,2).\n\n(1,4) is a body segment, but (2,4) is new head.\n\nThen from (2,4), I can go to (3,4) or (2,3) or U to (2,5) but (2,5) is now body, so I cannot go there, collision.\n\nPossible moves from (2,4): current direction after move? After moving down, head direction is now D, so I can move L, R, D, but not U (up) because opposite.\n\nHead was at (2,5), moved D to (2,4), so direction is now down.\n\nNext turn, I can move L (left), R (right), D (down), but not U (up).\n\nCells: (2,3) down, (3,4) right, (1,4) left but (1,4) is body? (1,4) is in positions, yes, occupied, so cannot move there.\n\n(2,3) is down, is it free? (2,3) not in snake positions, so free.\n\n(3,4) right, not in positions, free.\n\nSo from (2,4), I can go to (2,3) or (3,4).\n\nIf I go to (3,4), then I can later go to (4,4) or something to reach food.\n\nBut to reach (4,5), from (3,4) I need to go up to (3,5) then to (4,5), but (3,5) might be free now.\n\nAfter moving to (2,4) on turn 63, positions: head (2,4), body (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), etc.\n\n(3,5) is free.\n\nThen turn 64, from (2,4), direction down, I move R to (3,4).\n\nThen positions: head (3,4), body (2,4), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), ... tail.\n\nThen turn 65, from (3,4), direction right (since moved right), so can move U, D, R.\n\nU to (3,5), D to (3,3), R to (4,4).\n\n(3,5) is free, (4,4) free, (3,3) free.\n\nThen to reach (4,5), I can go to (3,5) then (4,5).\n\nOr directly to (4,4) then (4,5).\n\nBut (4,5) is food, so if I go to (4,5) on turn 65 or 66.\n\nSimilarly for (4,3).\n\nBut life span: (4,3) must be eaten by turn 67.\n\nIn this path, if I start from (2,4) on turn 63, then to (3,4) on 64, then to (3,5) on 65, then to (4,5) on 66? Turn 65 to (3,5), then turn 66 to (4,5).\n\nEat on turn 66.\n\nThen for (4,3), I need to go down, but from (4,5), I can go D to (4,4) on turn 67, then to (4,3) on turn 68, but food at (4,3) disappears after turn 67? Turn 67 is when life span reaches 0?\n\nLife span at turn 63: 5\n\nTurn 64:4\n\nTurn 65:3\n\nTurn 66:2\n\nTurn 67:1\n\nTurn 68:0 disappear\n\nSo at turn 67, life span 1, so I can eat on turn 67.\n\nIf I go to (4,5) on turn 66, then turn 67 move to (4,4), not eating, then turn 68 to (4,3) but on turn 68 it disappears, so cannot eat.\n\nAfter eating on turn 66, head at (4,5), grow.\n\nThen turn 67, I can move directly to (4,4)? But (4,4) has no food, or to (4,3) directly? From (4,5) to (4,3) is not adjacent, I need to go through (4,4).\n\nSo move to (4,4) on turn 67, then to (4,3) on turn 68.\n\nBut on turn 68, food at (4,3) is gone, since life span 0 after turn 67? Turn 67: life span 1, I can eat if I move to it on turn 67.\n\nBut from (4,5), on turn 67, I can move to (4,4) or to (3,5) or to (5,5) etc., but not directly to (4,3).\n\nSo to reach (4,3), I need to go to (4,4) first on turn 67, then (4,3) on turn 68.\n\nBut on turn 68, food is gone, so I miss it.\n\nIf I go to (4,4) on turn 67, but (4,4) has no food, then on turn 68 to (4,3) no food.\n\nSo I cannot eat (4,3) if I delay.\n\nIn the first plan, when I went directly to (4,5) on turn 64, then to (4,4) on 65, then to (4,3) on 66, I eat both on time.\n\nIn the alternative, if I go down first, I might miss (4,3).\n\nMoreover, going down to (2,4) might not be efficient.\n\nAnother option: move U to (2,6) on turn 63.\n\n(2,6) is free? y=6, not 7, so not wall. Not body.\n\nThen from (2,6), I can go to (3,6) or (2,7) but y=7 is wall, so cannot go up. (1,6) left, or (3,6) right.\n\nBut (4,5) is at y=5, so going up might take me away from food.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) is down.\n\nSo not efficient to go up.\n\nTherefore, the best is to go right to (3,5) on turn 63.\n\nThen as planned.\n\nBut I need to think about after eating both foods.\n\nAfter eating (4,5) and (4,3), snake is at (4,3) on turn 66, length 17.\n\nThen I need to find a safe path.\n\nThe grid has walls, and the snake body occupies many cells.\n\nFree cells: let's list all free cells.\n\nGrid: x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (4,6).\n\nSo cells like (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x, and (4,6).\n\nBut (4,6) is internal.\n\nNow snake occupies 15 cells, but after eating two, 17, but let's see available space.\n\nTotal cells: 8x8=64, minus walls: the border walls occupy cells, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, so there are (8 cells for x=0) + (8 for x=7) + (6 for y=0, since corners counted once) + (6 for y=7) minus corners double-counted? Better: number of wall cells.\n\nFor x=0, all y=0 to 7: 8 cells\n\nx=7, all y=0 to 7: 8 cells\n\ny=0, all x=1 to 6 (since x=0 and x=7 already counted): 6 cells\n\ny=7, all x=1 to 6: 6 cells\n\nPlus internal (4,6): 1 cell\n\nTotal wall cells: 8+8+6+6+1 = 29? 8+8=16, 16+6=22, 22+6=28, +1=29 wall cells.\n\nTotal cells: 64, so free cells: 64-29=35, but snake occupies some.\n\nAt start, snake 15 cells, so free: 35 - 15? No, total cells include walls and free, but walls are separate.\n\nGrid has 64 cells.\n\nWalls occupy 29 cells as above? Let's calculate properly.\n\nx from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nBorder walls: all (0,y) for y=0 to 7: 8 cells\n\n(7,y) for y=0 to 7: 8 cells\n\n(x,0) for x=1 to 6 (since x=0 and x=7 already have y=0): (x,0) for x=1 to 6: 6 cells\n\nSimilarly (x,7) for x=1 to 6: 6 cells\n\nInternal obstacle (4,6): 1 cell\n\nBut (0,0), (0,7), (7,0), (7,7) are included in the first sets.\n\nSo total wall cells: 8 (left) + 8 (right) + 6 (bottom, middle) + 6 (top, middle) + 1 (internal) = 29, yes.\n\nTotal cells: 64.\n\nFree cells: 64 - 29 = 35, but this includes cells occupied by snake? No, walls are separate from playable cells.\n\nThe playable area is the cells not walls, so 64 - 29 = 35 cells that can be occupied or free.\n\nSnake occupies 15 cells, so number of free cells: 35 - 15 = 20 free cells.\n\nAfter eating two foods, snake grows by 2, so 17 cells, free cells 18? 35 - 17 = 18 free cells.\n\nBut food cells are part of the free until eaten.\n\nNow, after being at (4,3), I need to move to open space.\n\nFor example, (3,3), (4,4), (5,3), etc.\n\n(3,3) might be free, (5,3) free, etc.\n\nAlso, (3,2) is tail or something, but it moves.\n\nIn the long run, I need to avoid trapping myself.\n\nBut since I have to plan only a few turns for the answer, but the instruction says \"think 5+ turns ahead\" for decision, but answer format is to give actions for multiple turns.\n\nAnswer format: \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but it doesn't specify how many turns to output. It says \"...\" so I think I need to provide a sequence for several turns, at least until I eat or something.\n\nBut to be safe, I should provide actions for the next 5 turns or so.\n\nCurrent turn t1=63, so I need actions for turn 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, etc.\n\nIn my plan, I can specify.\n\nBut let's confirm if moving to (3,5) is safe on turn 63.\n\nAnother thing: when I go to (3,5), then to (4,5), but is there any risk with the body?\n\nFor example, after moving to (4,5), the body is behind.\n\nSpecifically, when I move to (4,5) from (3,5), I eat, so the body includes (3,5), (2,5), etc.\n\nNow, (2,5) is a body segment, but it's not in front.\n\nFrom (4,5), I move down to (4,4), which is free.\n\nThen to (4,3).\n\nNow, after at (4,3), on turn 66, after eating.\n\nThen turn 67, I need to move somewhere.\n\nFrom (4,3), head direction: since I moved down to (4,3) from (4,4)? On turn 66, I moved from (4,4) to (4,3), so direction down.\n\nSo on turn 67, head at (4,3), direction D, so I can move L, R, D, not U.\n\nPossible moves: L to (3,3), R to (5,3), D to (4,2).\n\nNow, (4,2) is body? After positions on turn 66: after eating at (4,3), head at (4,3), grow, so positions: head (4,3), then (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2) — tail is (5,2), length 17.\n\n(4,2) is not in positions, so free? (4,2) was tail before, but now not.\n\nCurrent positions: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2)\n\nSo (4,2) not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3) not occupied, (5,3) not occupied.\n\n(4,2) is down, y=2.\n\ny=0 is wall, but (4,2) is not wall.\n\nWalls: y=0 is bottom, so (4,2) is above.\n\nSo moves: D to (4,2), L to (3,3), R to (5,3).\n\nAll should be free.\n\nNow, (4,2) might be a good choice to go down, but let's see the area below.\n\nThere is also the internal obstacle at (4,6), but it's not relevant now.\n\nTo maximize survival, I should head to open areas.\n\nFor example, the right side has more space? x=5,6 y=3,4, etc.\n\n(5,3) is free, (6,3) free, etc.\n\n(3,3) free, (2,3) free, etc.\n\nBut the snake has a lot of body on the left and bottom.\n\nPerhaps moving right to (5,3) might be better to avoid the crowded area.\n\nBut I need to output actions.\n\nSince I have to provide a sequence, I can do:\n\nTurn 63: R (to (3,5))\n\nTurn 64: R (to (4,5), eat)\n\nTurn 65: D (to (4,4))\n\nTurn 66: D (to (4,3), eat)\n\nNow for turn 67, from (4,3), direction D, I can move, say, R to (5,3) to go to open space.\n\n(5,3) should be free.\n\nThen turn 68, from (5,3), direction R (since moved right), so can move U, D, R, not L.\n\nU to (5,4), D to (5,2), R to (6,3).\n\n(5,4) free? Not sure, but likely free.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut I don't need to specify beyond, but for thinking ahead.\n\nAnother thing: on turn 65, when I move to (4,4), is there any food? No, but I need to make sure it's safe.\n\n(4,4) should be free.\n\nBut let's double-check the life span.\n\nFood at (4,3): at turn 63, life span 5.\n\nAfter turn 63 (when I move, turn is incremented after action, I think.\n\nThe state is at turn 63, before action.\n\nI perform action on turn 63.\n\nAfter action, turn increments to 64.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current.\n\nRule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nAnd \"disappears after N turns\", so at the start of turn 63, life span is 5.\n\nAfter turn 63, it becomes 4.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nWhen I move on turn 63 to (3,5), no eat.\n\nTurn 64: move to (4,5), eat, and at this point, food life span: after turn 64, it decreases to 3 for (4,5)? Let's track.\n\nFor food at (4,3):\n\nAt turn 63 start: life span 5\n\nAfter turn 63 action: life span decreases to 4 (end of turn 63)\n\nStart of turn 64: life span 4\n\nAfter turn 64 action: decreases to 3\n\n...\n\nSimilarly, when I eat on turn 66 at (4,3):\n\nStart of turn 66: life span should be 1? Let's see:\n\nTurn 63 start: 5\n\nAfter turn 63: 4\n\nTurn 64 start: 4\n\nAfter turn 64: 3\n\nTurn 65 start: 3\n\nAfter turn 65: 2\n\nTurn 66 start: 2\n\nAfter turn 66: if I eat, I consume it before decrease? I think when I move to the cell, I eat it during the action.\n\nRule: \"the head moves onto the food cell\" to eat.\n\nSo on turn 66, when I move to (4,3), I eat it, and at that time, life span is still the value at start of turn.\n\nLife span decreases after the turn, I believe.\n\nThe rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\".\n\nIt might be ambiguous, but typically, the countdown decreases at the end of the turn.\n\nBut to be precise: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" – I think it means that during the turn, the countdown is as given, and after the turn, it decreases.\n\nBut when you move, you do the action during the turn.\n\nI think it's safer to assume that if life span is L at start of turn, you can eat it during that turn, and after turn, it decreases to L-1, but if L=1, after decrease it becomes 0 and disappears.\n\nSo for (4,3), life span 5 at turn 63 start.\n\nI can eat it on turn 63,64,65,66,67, since on turn 67 start, life span=1, eat on turn 67, then after turn, it would decrease to 0.\n\nIf not eaten, after turn 67, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly for (4,5), life span 8 at turn 63, can be eaten up to turn 70.\n\nIn my plan, eating (4,3) on turn 66 is fine, life span 2 at start? Turn 66 start: after turn 65 decrease, life span=2 for (4,3)? Let's list:\n\nTurn 63 start: (4,3) life=5\n\nAfter turn 63 action: life decreases to 4\n\nTurn 64 start: life=4\n\nAfter turn 64: life=3\n\nTurn 65 start: life=3\n\nAfter turn 65: life=2\n\nTurn 66 start: life=2\n\nI move to (4,3) on turn 66, eat it, so consumed.\n\nAfter turn 66, life would decrease to 1, but since eaten, it's gone.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat on turn 67: turn 67 start: life=1 (after decrease from turn 66), I eat, consumed.\n\nIn my earlier alternative, I thought about eating on turn 67, but from (4,5) on turn 66, I can't reach directly.\n\nBack to plan.\n\nSo for turn 67, after being at (4,3) with direction D, I need to choose action.\n\nTo avoid the body, moving right to (5,3) might be good.\n\n(5,3) is free, as per positions.\n\nThen from there, I can explore.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to provide the sequence.\n\nPerhaps I should provide actions until turn 67 or so.\n\nBut let's see if there is any immediate danger.\n\nAnother point: the food at (4,5) is at (4,5), and when I go to eat it, the head is at (4,5), and the tail is at (3,2) initially, but after moves, it changes.\n\nBut not adjacent.\n\nAlso, is there any body segment at (4,5)? No.\n\nBut in the positions, when I move to (4,5), the body is at (3,5), which is adjacent, but that's fine, as long as not colliding when moving.\n\nMoving to (4,5) from (3,5), (3,5) is the previous head, so when I move, (3,5) becomes body, but I'm moving to (4,5), which is empty, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, what about the internal obstacle (4,6): it's above, but since I'm going down, not an issue.\n\nNow, for the sequence:\n\nTurn 63: R (to (3,5))\n\nTurn 64: R (to (4,5), eat)\n\nTurn 65: D (to (4,4))\n\nTurn 66: D (to (4,3), eat)\n\nThen for turn 67, I need to choose.\n\nSince I have to provide, I can say R to (5,3) for example.\n\nTo think 5 turns ahead: from turn 63 to 67.\n\nTurn 63,64,65,66,67: that's 5 actions.\n\nTurn 63: action for turn 63\n\nTurn 64: action for turn 64\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 67.\n\nIn my plan:\n\nTurn 63: R\n\nTurn 64: R\n\nTurn 65: D\n\nTurn 66: D\n\nThen turn 67: from (4,3) direction D, move R to (5,3)\n\nIs (5,3) free? At that point, positions after turn 66: head at (4,3), body (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), etc. as before.\n\n(5,3) not occupied, not wall.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) is within bounds.\n\nSo yes.\n\nI could move L or D, but R seems good to go to the right where there might be more space.\n\n(5,2) is body? After turn 66, positions include (5,2) as tail? Earlier: positions: head (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2)\n\nSo (5,2) is the tail, (5,3) is free.\n\nD to (4,2) is also free, but (4,2) might be close to body, but free now.\n\nL to (3,3) free.\n\nBut moving R to (5,3) is fine.\n\nNow, to complete the answer.\n\nBut the food at (4,5) is eaten, and (4,3) eaten.\n\nIs there any other food? Only two given.\n\nSo for the sequence:\n\nTurn 63: R\n\nTurn 64: R\n\nTurn 65: D\n\nTurn 66: D\n\nTurn 67: R\n\nBut in the answer format, I need to box it.\n\nAlso, for turn 67, I set to R, but I could specify.\n\nSince thinking ahead, this should be ok.\n\nBut let's confirm the directions.\n\nOn turn 63, head direction R, move R to (3,5), so new direction R.\n\nTurn 64, from (3,5), direction R, move R to (4,5), eat, new direction R.\n\nTurn 65, from (4,5), direction R, but I move D down to (4,4). Now, moving down from right, is that allowed? Yes, no instant reverse, but down is not opposite to right, opposite would be left. So moving down is fine, new direction D.\n\nTurn 66, from (4,4), direction D, move D to (4,3), eat, new direction D.\n\nTurn 67, from (4,3), direction D, move R to (5,3). Moving right from down, not opposite, so allowed, new direction R.\n\nAll good.\n\nI think this maximizes the score by eating both foods safely.\n\nIf I had gone other ways, I might miss one food.\n\nSo I'll go with this.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating both positive foods while ensuring long-term survival, the plan involves moving directly towards the food at (4,5) first, as it is reachable in two moves from the current position. After eating it, the snake proceeds down to eat the food at (4,3), which has a shorter life span and must be consumed by turn 67. This sequence ensures both foods are eaten within their life spans, adding +2 to the score and increasing the snake's length by 2.\n\n### Key Considerations for the Plan:\n- **Current State (Turn 63)**: Snake head at (2,5) moving right. Food at (4,5) (life span 8, disappears after turn 70) and (4,3) (life span 5, disappears after turn 67). Both foods are positive (+1 value).\n- **Risk Avoidance**: \n  - Moving to (3,5) on turn 63 is safe—no walls, obstacles, or body collisions.\n  - Eating (4,5) on turn 64 is safe—tail is at (3,2), not adjacent, so no tail reward danger.\n  - Moving to (4,4) on turn 65 is safe—cell is free and not a wall.\n  - Eating (4,3) on turn 66 is safe—life span allows it (life span 2 at start of turn 66), and no collision risks.\n  - After eating both foods, moving right to (5,3) on turn 67 avoids the dense body area on the left and heads towards open space for better survival.\n- **5+ Turn Lookahead**: \n  - The plan eats both foods efficiently, with (4,5) consumed on turn 64 and (4,3) on turn 66.\n  - After turn 67, the snake is positioned at (5,3) with direction right, allowing access to open cells like (5,4), (6,3), or (5,2) for continued survival. The right side of the grid has more free space (e.g., (5,3), (5,4), (6,3), (6,4) are free), reducing collision risks.\n  - Life spans are tracked: (4,3) life span decreases to 1 at turn 67 start, but it is eaten on turn 66; (4,5) is eaten well before its expiration.\n- **Movement Constraints**: \n  - No instant reverse is violated (e.g., moving right then left is avoided).\n  - Wall and obstacle collisions are checked for each move: internal obstacle at (4,6) is irrelevant to the path.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 63**: Move R (right) to (3,5). This progresses toward (4,5) without delay. Direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 64**: Move R (right) to (4,5) and eat the food (+1 score, length increases to 16). Direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 65**: Move D (down) to (4,4). This positions the snake to reach (4,3) next. Cell (4,4) is free and safe. Direction becomes D.\n- **Turn 66**: Move D (down) to (4,3) and eat the food (+1 score, length increases to 17). Cell (4,3) is free, and life span (2 at turn start) allows eating. Direction becomes D.\n- **Turn 67**: Move R (right) to (5,3). This moves the snake away from potential body congestion and towards open space. Cell (5,3) is free and safe. Direction becomes R.\n\nThis sequence eats both foods by turn 66, adding +2 to the score, and sets up for safe exploration beyond turn 67. Beyond this, to continue maximizing survival and score, the snake should prioritize moving to open areas (e.g., right or up if possible) to avoid trapping itself.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 63: R\nTurn 64: R\nTurn 65: D\nTurn 66: D\nTurn 67: R\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6). There's also an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nThe snake positions are given: head at (3,5), then (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2). That's 15 segments. The head direction is right, so it's moving east.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (4,3) with life_span=4, value=1 (positive)\n\n- (4,5) with life_span=7, value=1 (positive)\n\n- (3,2) with life_span=10, value=1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive; no negative food mentioned. Life_span decreases each turn, including the current turn, so I need to consider how many turns they have left.\n\nCurrent turn is 64. So for food at (4,3): life_span=4, so it disappears after turn 67? Let's calculate: at turn 64, life_span=4, so it decreases to 3 at turn 65, 2 at 66, 1 at 67, and gone at turn 68. Similarly, (4,5): life_span=7, gone after turn 70. (3,2): life_span=10, gone after turn 73.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead, so let's consider up to turn 69 or so.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid. I'll sketch a 6x6 grid from (1,1) to (6,6). Walls are borders and (4,6) is blocked.\n\nList of wall cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all borders, so cells like (0,y) and (7,y) for all y, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x. But since playable area is 1-6, we don't care about outside. Internal obstacle at (4,6), so (4,6) is a wall.\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (3,5)\n\nBody: (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2)\n\nSo the snake is long; 15 segments.\n\nFood: (4,3), (4,5), (3,2)\n\n(4,5) is at row 5, column 4? Coordinates: (x,y), so (4,5) is x=4, y=5.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) is x=4, y=3, (3,2) is x=3, y=2.\n\nNow, head is at (3,5), moving right, so next moves could be U, D, L, R. But since moving right, cannot instantly reverse to left, so L is not allowed. Possible moves: U, D, R.\n\nU: (x,y+1) = (3,6)\n\nD: (x,y-1) = (3,4)\n\nR: (x+1,y) = (4,5)\n\nNow, (4,5) has food! Value=1, positive.\n\nBut I need to check if it's safe to eat.\n\nFirst, is (4,5) occupied by snake body? Snake positions: (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), ... (1,5) is body, but (4,5) is not listed, so not occupied by snake currently. But food can be under snake body? In this case, it's not under, it's free.\n\nBut let's see if moving to (4,5) is possible.\n\n(4,5) is within bounds, not a wall. Walls: borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (4,5) is fine. Internal obstacle (4,6) is above, but not here.\n\nNow, if I move right to (4,5), I eat the food there, since it's present. Then snake grows by one, so new head at (4,5), and tail stays, so the segment that was tail will not move, but since we eat, tail doesn't move, so positions: new head (4,5), then previous head (3,5) becomes part of body, and so on.\n\nBut I need to check for collisions after eating.\n\nAlso, there's a rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (4,2), I think? Snake positions list: [(3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2)] so tail is (4,2).\n\nHead is at (3,5), tail at (4,2). Are they adjacent? Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right. (3,5) and (4,2): x differs by 1, y differs by 3, not adjacent; they are not close. So no issue here.\n\nNow, if I move to (4,5), I eat the food, grow to 16 segments.\n\nBut after moving, the body is still there. When I move to (4,5), head is there, and the body includes (3,5), which was head, now body. But (4,5) was empty, so no collision.\n\nThen next turn, tail moves? When you eat, the tail doesn't move for that turn, so the snake grows.\n\nStandard Snake: when you eat food, you grow, so the tail stays in place; when you don't eat, tail moves.\n\nHere, if I eat at (4,5), after move, head at (4,5), body from (3,5) to (4,2), and since I ate, the tail doesn't move next time; it stays, so snake gets longer.\n\nNow, but I need to think ahead.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the options.\n\nPossible moves from (3,5) with direction right: U, D, R.\n\nU: to (3,6)\n\nD: to (3,4)\n\nR: to (4,5) with food.\n\nNow, check if these cells are safe.\n\nFirst, (3,6): is it wall or body?\n\nWalls: y=7 is wall, but y=6 is within 1-6, so ok. x=3, y=6. Internal obstacles: (4,6) is wall, but (3,6) is not listed, so should be free.\n\nSnake body: positions include (1,1) to (6,2), etc., (3,6) not occupied, so empty.\n\n(3,4): x=3,y=4. Not wall, not snake body? Body has (1,4), (1,3), etc., but (3,4) not listed, so empty.\n\n(4,5): not wall, not body, has food.\n\nAll seem possible, but I need to think long-term.\n\nFood at (4,5) has life_span=7, which is plenty, but since I'm at (3,5), moving right directly eats it now.\n\nBut is it better to eat now or later?\n\nSince it's positive food, eating it gives +1 and grows snake, which might make it harder to maneuver later, but also, growing is good for score.\n\nBut I need to avoid risks.\n\nThere are other foods: (4,3) with shorter life_span=4, so it might disappear soon if not eaten.\n\n(3,2) has longer life.\n\nAlso, the snake is long, 15 segments, so the board might be crowded.\n\nLet me sketch the grid mentally.\n\nGrid rows y=1 to 6, columns x=1 to 6.\n\nWalls: all borders, but since x=0,7 y=0,7 are walls, so cells (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except internal wall at (4,6).\n\nSo (4,6) is blocked.\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (3,5)\n\nBody: (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2)\n\nSo let's list occupied cells:\n\nRow y=5: (3,5) head, (2,5), (1,5)\n\ny=4: (1,4)\n\ny=3: (1,3)\n\ny=2: (1,2), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2)  (4,2) is tail? Positions: after (1,2) it goes to (1,1), then (2,1), etc. So y=2: (1,2), and later (6,2), (5,2), (4,2)\n\ny=1: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\nAnd (4,2) is also y=2.\n\nNow, empty cells: for example, (2,4), (2,3), (2,2) but (2,2) is not listed? Snake has (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), no (2,2), so (2,2) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) has food, but (3,2) is not in snake positions? Snake positions: from head (3,5), then (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2). So (3,2) is not listed, so it should be empty, but it has food, so it's occupied by food, but snake can move there if head goes.\n\n(3,2) has food, value 1.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) food, (4,5) food.\n\n(4,5) is at y=5,x=4, which is not snake, so free except food.\n\nNow, back to moves at turn 64.\n\nOption 1: Move Right to (4,5) - eat food, grow to 16.\n\nThen head at (4,5), direction right? After moving, new direction is right.\n\nThen from there, possible moves: U, D, L, R. But cannot reverse to left immediately? Since moved right, next cannot go left.\n\nCurrent direction is right, after moving right to (4,5), direction is right, so next cannot go left.\n\nPossible: U to (4,6), but (4,6) is wall! Internal obstacle, so cannot.\n\nD to (4,4)\n\nR to (5,5)\n\nL to (3,5) but (3,5) is now body, since head moved, (3,5) is second segment.\n\n(3,5) is occupied by body now.\n\nIf I move to (4,5), then positions: head (4,5), then body (3,5), (2,5), etc. to (4,2)? Tail is (4,2), but since I ate, tail doesn't move, so snake has 16 segments: head (4,5), then (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2) — and tail at (4,2).\n\nNow from (4,5), moves:\n\nU: (4,6) - but (4,6) is wall, so invalid, collision.\n\nD: (4,4) - is it free? Currently, (4,4) not occupied, no food listed, so empty.\n\nR: (5,5) - empty? Not in snake, not wall.\n\nL: (3,5) - but (3,5) is body, so if I move left to (3,5), I collide with body, die.\n\nAnd also, since direction was right, moving left is reverse, which is not allowed immediately? The rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nCurrent direction when at (4,5) is right, so moving left would be opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (4,4) or R to (5,5), U is wall, L not allowed.\n\nNow, (4,4) and (5,5) both seem ok, but let's see.\n\nIf I go to (5,5), that might be better for accessing other areas.\n\nBut I have food at (4,3) which is below, life_span=4, so I need to eat it soon.\n\nAt turn 64, if I move right to (4,5), I eat it turn 64.\n\nThen at turn 65, head at (4,5), I can go D to (4,4) or R to (5,5).\n\n(4,3) is at (4,3), which is down from (4,4), so if I go to (4,4) at turn 65, then from there I can go to (4,3) at turn 66.\n\n(4,3) life_span=4, at turn 64, so turn 65: life_span=3, turn 66:2, turn 67:1, gone turn 68. So at turn 66, if I eat, it's still there.\n\nBut at turn 66, life_span=2? At turn 64, life_span=4, after turn 64, it decreases to 3, so at turn 65, life_span=3, at turn 66, life_span=2, at turn 67, life_span=1, at turn 68, gone.\n\nSo I need to eat by turn 67.\n\nIf I go to (4,5) at turn 64, then turn 65: say go D to (4,4), then turn 66: go D to (4,3) to eat.\n\n(4,4) to (4,3) is down, so yes.\n\nFrom (4,4), I could go to other places, but (4,3) is below.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 65 I go R to (5,5), then from (5,5), I can go down to (5,4) or left to (4,5) but (4,5) is body, or right to (6,5), etc., but to reach (4,3) it might take longer, and I might not make it in time.\n\nFor example, from (5,5) to (4,3): not directly, need to go down then left or something.\n\n(5,5) to (5,4) to (5,3) to (4,3)? (5,4) and (5,3) might be free, but it takes more turns.\n\nAt turn 65: at (5,5), turn 66: to (5,4), turn 67: to (5,3), turn 68: to (4,3) but at turn 68, food disappears? Turn 67: life_span=1, if I move to (4,3) on turn 67, I eat it before it disappears? At turn 67, if life_span=1, and I eat, it should be ok, then it disappears after that turn.\n\nLife_span decreases at the end of the turn or beginning? The rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\".\n\nI think it decreases after the turn or during? Let's see: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so for example, at turn t, when we start, life_span is given, after the turn, it decreases by 1? Or before?\n\nThe rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", but it doesn't specify when.\n\nSimilarly, \"disappears after N turns\" meaning after N turns from now.\n\nTo be safe, I think we should consider that at the beginning of turn, life_span is as given, and after the action, it decreases.\n\nBut for eating, if head moves to food cell during the turn, it eats it.\n\nSo for (4,3), at turn 64, life_span=4. After turn 64, it decreases to 3. So at turn 65, life_span=3, and so on.\n\nIf I eat it at turn 66, when life_span is 2, it should be fine, as long as I eat before it reaches 0.\n\nAt turn 67, life_span=1, I eat it, then after eating, it decreases to 0 and disappears, but since I ate it, it's gone.\n\nThe food disappears after N turns, meaning it exists for N turns including the current, so at turn t, if life_span=k, it will be there until turn t+k-1? Let's clarify.\n\nAssume: at turn t, life_span = L, it will disappear after L more turns, so it exists for turns t to t+L-1, and is gone at turn t+L.\n\nFor example, at turn 64, L=4, so exists at turn 64,65,66,67; gone at turn 68.\n\nSimilarly, L=7 for (4,5): exists turn 64 to 70, gone 71.\n\nL=10 for (3,2): exists 64 to 73, gone 74.\n\nBack to eating (4,3): I need to eat by turn 67.\n\nNow, if at turn 64 I move right to (4,5), eat that.\n\nThen at turn 65, from (4,5), I can go down to (4,4).\n\nThen at turn 66, from (4,4) to (4,3), eat (4,3).\n\nThat works.\n\nIf at turn 65 I go to (5,5), then to reach (4,3) I need at least two more moves: e.g., turn 66 to (5,4), turn 67 to (4,3) if possible, but (4,3) might be reachable from (5,4) only if I go left, but (4,4) might be in the way or not.\n\n(5,4) to (4,4) or (5,3) or (4,3)? From (5,4), moving to (4,4) or (5,3) or (6,4), etc. (4,3) is not adjacent to (5,4); (5,4) to (4,4) is left, then from (4,4) to (4,3) down. Or directly? No, not adjacent.\n\nSo from (5,4), I can go to (4,4) or (5,3), then to (4,3).\n\nSo earliest to eat (4,3) is turn 67 if I go to (5,4) on turn 66 and (4,3) on turn 67.\n\nBut on turn 67, life_span=1, so I can eat it.\n\nBut it's cutting it close, and if there are obstacles, it might not be possible.\n\nWhereas going directly down from (4,5) to (4,4) to (4,3) is straightforward.\n\nNow, another option: at turn 64, instead of moving right to food, I could move up or down.\n\nMove up to (3,6): is that possible? (3,6) is y=6, which is not wall, walls at y=7, so y=6 is playable. Internal obstacle at (4,6), but (3,6) is different.\n\n(3,6) is empty, I think. Snake body: y=6, what is there? Snake has positions up to y=5 and y=1,2, etc., no y=6 positions, so (3,6) should be empty.\n\nSimilarly, move down to (3,4).\n\nIf I move up to (3,6), then I don't eat immediately, but I can plan for other foods.\n\nBut (4,5) food is there, and I can eat it later, but why delay if it's safe?\n\nBut moving up might be risky or not necessary.\n\nSimilarly, moving down to (3,4).\n\n(3,4) is empty, I think. Snake has (1,4), (1,3), etc., not (3,4).\n\nFrom (3,4), I can go to other places.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (3,2).\n\n(3,2) has food, and it's closer to the tail or something.\n\nAlso, the tail is at (4,2), which is near (3,2).\n\n(4,2) is tail, (3,2) is food.\n\nIf I eat (3,2), I need to be careful because of tail reward danger.\n\nTail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills.\n\nBut here, tail is at (4,2), and (3,2) is food, not tail.\n\nThe food is at (3,2), which is separate.\n\nTail is at (4,2), no food on tail, I think.\n\nThe rule: food can spawn under body, but in this case, (4,2) is tail, and no food is listed there; food is at (3,2), which is different cell.\n\nSo (3,2) has food, and it's not under snake, I think.\n\nSnake positions: (4,2) is tail, and (3,2) is not occupied, so food is there.\n\nNow, head at (3,5), to reach (3,2), I need to go down.\n\nBut there are body segments below.\n\nFrom (3,5), if I move down to (3,4), then I can go further down.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nFirst, back to turn 64 choices.\n\nOption A: Move right to (4,5) - eat food, grow.\n\nThen as above, I can go down to (4,4) on turn 65, then to (4,3) on turn 66 to eat that food.\n\nThen from (4,3), where to go?\n\nAfter turn 66, head at (4,3), after eating, so snake grows again, to 17 segments? Started with 15, ate at 64, grew to 16, ate at 66, grow to 17.\n\nThen positions: head (4,3), body (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), ... down to tail.\n\nTail was at (4,2), but after moving and eating, let's trace.\n\nAt turn 64: move to (4,5), eat, head (4,5), body (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2) — tail (4,2).\n\nSince ate, tail stays, so no move for tail.\n\nTurn 65: from (4,5), move D to (4,4). Now, since no food at (4,4), so no eat, tail moves. Tail was (4,2), but when no eat, tail moves forward.\n\nSnake movement: when no food eaten, head moves to new cell, tail moves away from its cell.\n\nWhen food eaten, head moves, tail stays, so new cell added.\n\nAt turn 65: move from (4,5) to (4,4), no food there, so tail moves. Tail is at (4,2), and the segment before tail is (5,2) or what? Positions: before turn 65, positions: head (4,5), then (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2) tail.\n\nAfter moving head to (4,4), no eat, so tail moves off (4,2). The tail was (4,2), and the previous segment is (5,2), so tail moves to where? In snake, the tail segment is removed, so the new tail is the previous segment.\n\nAfter move: head at (4,4), then the body: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2) — and (4,2) is removed, so tail is (5,2).\n\nLength 15 again? No, at turn 64, after eating, length 16. Then turn 65, no eat, so length decreases to 15? No.\n\nTurn 64: started with 15 segments, moved to (4,5) and ate, so new head (4,5), body includes all previous, tail stays, so 16 segments.\n\nTurn 65: move to (4,4), no food, so head to (4,4), and tail is removed. So the cell that was tail, (4,2), is now empty. The new snake has head (4,4), then (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2) — that's 15 segments, tail at (5,2).\n\n(5,2) was the second last, now tail.\n\nThen turn 66: from (4,4) move to (4,3), which has food, so eat, grow to 16. Head at (4,3), body (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), etc. down to (5,2), tail (5,2) stays.\n\nNow, from (4,3), where to go? Possible moves: U to (4,4) but (4,4) is body, collision. D to (4,2)? (4,2) is now empty? At this point, after turn 66, positions: head (4,3), body (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), ... to (6,2), (5,2) tail. (4,2) was tail at some point, but now it's empty since tail moved to (5,2) after turn 65? In turn 65, tail was removed from (4,2), so (4,2) is free.\n\nFrom (4,3), moves:\n\nU: (4,4) - body, collision, die.\n\nD: (4,2) - should be free, as above.\n\nL: (3,3) - what is (3,3)? Not occupied, I think.\n\nR: (5,3) - similarly.\n\nAnd direction: from (4,4) to (4,3) was down, so direction down.\n\nSo at (4,3), direction down, so cannot move up immediately (reverse).\n\nPossible moves: D to (4,2), L to (3,3), R to (5,3).\n\n(4,2) is free, as we said.\n\n(3,3) and (5,3) should be free.\n\n(3,3): snake has (3,5), (3,1), but not (3,3), so empty.\n\n(5,3) similarly.\n\nNow, food at (3,2) is below, at (3,2).\n\n(3,2) has food, value 1.\n\nBut (3,2) is adjacent to current position? From (4,3), (3,2) is not adjacent; it's diagonal, not direct move.\n\nTo reach (3,2), I need to go left or down then left, etc.\n\nIf I move down to (4,2), then from (4,2) I can go left to (3,2) or down to (4,1), but (4,1) is body? Positions: after turn 66, body has (4,1), which is part of snake.\n\nList: head (4,3), body (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2) tail. (5,2) is tail.\n\nSo (4,1) is occupied, (3,1), etc.\n\n(4,2) is empty, as we move to it.\n\nIf from (4,3) move D to (4,2), no food there, so no eat, tail moves.\n\nBut we are at turn 66, and we need to think actions for multiple turns.\n\nBut let's go back to turn 64 decision.\n\nIf I move right at turn 64, I can eat two foods quickly, but then at (4,3) after eating, I have limited moves: D, L, or R, but not U because (4,4) is body.\n\nAnd if I go down to (4,2), then I can go to (3,2) for the food.\n\n(3,2) has life_span=10, so plenty of time.\n\nBut let's see if moving right at 64 is good.\n\nAnother option at turn 64: move down to (3,4).\n\nThen from there, I can go to (4,4) or (3,3), etc.\n\nBut (4,5) food is there, if I don't eat now, I can eat later, but it might not be necessary.\n\nBut since it's positive, I should eat it if safe.\n\nMoving down to (3,4) at turn 64.\n\nThen head at (3,4), direction down? From (3,5) to (3,4) is down, so direction down.\n\nThen possible moves: L to (2,4), R to (4,4), D to (3,3), U to (3,5) but (3,5) is body, and reverse not allowed.\n\n(3,5) is now body since head moved.\n\nSo moves: L, R, D.\n\n(2,4): is it free? Snake has (1,4), (1,3), etc., not (2,4), so empty.\n\n(4,4): empty.\n\n(3,3): empty.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can go to (4,4) then to (4,5) to eat food, but (4,5) has food, so if I go to (4,4) at turn 65, then to (4,5) at turn 66 to eat.\n\nBut at turn 66, (4,5) life_span=5 at turn 64, turn 65:4, turn 66:3, still there.\n\nBut I also have (4,3) to eat soon.\n\nIf I go to (3,4) at turn 64, then turn 65 to (4,4), then turn 66 to (4,5) eat, then I can go down to (4,4) or something, but (4,4) is now body, etc., similar issue as before.\n\nThen to eat (4,3), from (4,5) after eating, I can go down to (4,4) on turn 67, but (4,4) might be body or not.\n\nAt turn 66, if I move to (4,5) from (4,4), and eat, so head at (4,5), body (4,4), etc.\n\nThen turn 67, from (4,5), I can go D to (4,4)? But (4,4) is body, collision. Or R to (5,5), or L not allowed, U wall. So only R to (5,5) or if D, but D to (4,4) body, invalid.\n\nSo from (4,5) after eating, only D if (4,4) free, but it's not, only R to (5,5).\n\nThen from (5,5), I can go to (5,4) etc., but to reach (4,3) it takes longer, and might miss the deadline if not careful.\n\nFor example, turn 67 at (5,5), turn 68 to (5,4), turn 69 to (5,3), then to (4,3) on turn 70, but (4,3) gone at turn 68? At turn 64, L=4, gone after turn 67, so at turn 68 it's gone. Turn 67 is last chance to eat.\n\nLife_span=4 at turn 64, exists turns 64,65,66,67; gone turn 68.\n\nSo at turn 67, I must be at (4,3) to eat.\n\nIf at turn 67 I am at (5,5), I cannot reach (4,3) in one move; it's not adjacent.\n\nSo I would miss (4,3) food if I don't eat it earlier.\n\nTherefore, to ensure I eat (4,3), I need to be in position to eat it by turn 67.\n\nThe safest way is to eat (4,5) at turn 64, then go to (4,4) at turn 65, then to (4,3) at turn 66 to eat.\n\nThat works.\n\nIf at turn 64 I move down to (3,4), then I can go to (4,4) at turn 65, then to (4,3) at turn 66 to eat (4,3) first, since it's more urgent.\n\n(4,3) life_span shorter.\n\nThen after eating (4,3) at turn 66, head at (4,3), then I can go to (4,4) or other, but (4,4) might be free or not.\n\nAt turn 64: move D to (3,4), no eat, so tail moves, snake length 15? Start 15, no eat, so after move, head (3,4), body (3,5), (2,5), etc., tail removed, so 14 segments? Let's not count length each time.\n\nTurn 64: positions before move: head (3,5), body as given.\n\nMove to (3,4), no food there, so new head (3,4), body (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2) — and (4,2) is removed since tail moved? Tail was (4,2), so after move, tail is (5,2), positions from (3,4) to (5,2), 14 segments? Original 15, head moved, tail removed, so 14 segments.\n\nThen turn 65: from (3,4) move to (4,4), no food, so head to (4,4), body (3,4), (3,5), etc., tail removed, new tail is (6,2) or something.\n\nBut (4,4) is empty, so move there.\n\nThen turn 66: from (4,4) move to (4,3), which has food, eat it. So grow, head at (4,3), body (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), etc., tail stays.\n\nNow, from (4,3), I can go to eat (4,5) or (3,2).\n\n(4,5) is above, but from (4,3), moving up to (4,4) but (4,4) is body, so cannot. Direction: from (4,4) to (4,3) was down, so at (4,3) direction down, cannot move up.\n\nCan move D to (4,2), L to (3,3), R to (5,3).\n\n(4,5) is at (4,5), which is not reachable directly.\n\nTo reach (4,5), I need to go around, for example, go to (5,3) then (5,4) then (5,5) or (4,5), but (4,5) might be accessible from (4,4) but (4,4) is body.\n\nFrom (4,3), if I go R to (5,3), then to (5,4), then to (5,5), then to (4,5) if possible.\n\nBut at (5,5), I can move to (4,5) if it's free.\n\nBut (4,5) has food, and if I can reach it.\n\nLife_span=7, so at turn 66, life_span=7 - (66-64) = at turn 64 L=7, turn 65 L=6, turn 66 L=5, so still many turns.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) can be eaten.\n\nBut in this path, I ate (4,3) at turn 66, but missed (4,5) for now, but I can get it later.\n\nHowever, by not eating (4,5) at turn 64, I might have a shorter snake, which could be easier to move, but since I need to maximize score, eating food is good.\n\nBut in the first option, by eating both, I get two foods quickly.\n\nAlso, in the first option, after eating (4,3) at turn 66, I am at (4,3) with direction down, and I can go to (4,2) or (3,3) or (5,3).\n\nNow, (3,2) food is at (3,2), so I can go to (4,2) then to (3,2) to eat.\n\nFor example, turn 66: at (4,3) after eating, move D to (4,2), no food, so no grow, tail moves.\n\nThen turn 67: from (4,2) move L to (3,2), which has food, eat it.\n\nThen grow.\n\nSo I can eat all three foods by turn 67.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 64: move R to (4,5) eat first food.\n\nTurn 65: move D to (4,4) no food.\n\nTurn 66: move D to (4,3) eat second food.\n\nTurn 67: from (4,3) move D to (4,2) no food? (4,2) may not have food.\n\nThen turn 68: move L to (3,2) eat third food.\n\nAt turn 67, from (4,3) move D to (4,2), no eat, so tail moves.\n\nThen positions: head (4,2), body (4,3), (4,4), etc.\n\nThen turn 68: from (4,2) move L to (3,2), which has food, eat it.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd (3,2) life_span=10, at turn 68, life_span=10 - (68-64) = 10-4=6, still there.\n\nSo all good.\n\nNow, what about moving up or down at turn 64?\n\nIf I move up to (3,6) at turn 64.\n\n(3,6) is empty.\n\nThen head at (3,6), direction up? From (3,5) to (3,6) is up.\n\nThen possible moves: since direction up, cannot move down immediately.\n\nU: (3,7) but y=7 is wall, invalid.\n\nL: (2,6)\n\nR: (4,6) but (4,6) is wall, internal obstacle.\n\nD: (3,5) body, and reverse not allowed.\n\nSo only possible move is L to (2,6).\n\nThen at turn 65, go to (2,6), which might be empty.\n\nBut then I am away from the foods, and (4,3) might expire before I can reach it.\n\nFor example, from (2,6), to reach (4,3) in few turns is hard, since I need to go right and down, but snake body might block.\n\nSimilarly, not efficient.\n\nMoving down to (3,4) at turn 64, as before, I can eat (4,3) quickly but might miss (4,5) or have harder time.\n\nBut with (4,5) having longer life, I can get it later.\n\nBut in the move right scenario, I get both (4,5) and (4,3) easily, and then (3,2).\n\nMoreover, after eating (3,2), I can explore other areas.\n\nBut there might be risks.\n\nAnother thing: the internal wall at (4,6) might affect movements.\n\nBut in the path I have, from (4,3) to (4,2) to (3,2), it should be fine.\n\nAt turn 67, after moving to (4,2), position: head (4,2), body (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), etc.\n\n(4,2) is head, then to (3,2) which is left, but (3,2) has food, so eat.\n\nBut is (3,2) under snake or something? No, it's free.\n\nBut let's check tail reward danger.\n\nWhen I move to (3,2) at turn 68, tail is where?\n\nAfter turn 67: moved to (4,2) no eat, so tail moved.\n\nBefore turn 67: after turn 66, head at (4,3), body (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2) tail.\n\nThen move to (4,2) no eat, so head to (4,2), body (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), ..., down to (6,2), (5,2)? The last is (5,2), but since no eat, tail is removed, so (5,2) removed, new tail is (6,2) or the previous.\n\nPositions: head (4,2), then (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) — and (5,2) removed, so tail is (6,2).\n\nLength 16? Turn 66 after eating (4,3), length 16? Start 15, eat at 64 to 16, eat at 66 to 17? Let's track length.\n\nTurn 64: start, 15 segments, eat at (4,5), grow to 16.\n\nTurn 65: move to (4,4) no eat, so length 15.\n\nTurn 66: move to (4,3) eat, grow to 16.\n\nThen turn 67: move to (4,2) no eat, so length 15.\n\nPositions: head (4,2), body (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) tail? From above: after move to (4,2), head (4,2), then (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), ..., to (6,1), (6,2) — that's 17 positions? Head and 16 body? List: indices: 1: (4,2) head, 2: (4,3), 3: (4,4), 4: (4,5), 5: (3,5), 6: (2,5), 7: (1,5), 8: (1,4), 9: (1,3), 10: (1,2), 11: (1,1), 12: (2,1), 13: (3,1), 14: (4,1), 15: (5,1), 16: (6,1), 17: (6,2) tail.\n\n(6,2) is tail? In the body list, after (6,1) it should be (6,2) but (6,2) was part of body, now it's the second last? Positions before turn 67 move: after turn 66, head (4,3), body: (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2) tail. 17 segments? Head (4,3) + 16 body? (4,4) to (5,2) is 16 cells? From index: head, then 16 body segments.\n\nBut original was 15, ate twice, so 17 segments after turn 66 eat.\n\nThen turn 67: move to (4,2) no eat, so head to (4,2), and tail (5,2) removed. So new positions: head (4,2), then (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) — (6,2) is now last, tail. 16 segments? Head + 15 body.\n\nBody from (4,3) to (6,2), that's 15 segments including (6,2)? Positions: 1 head (4,2), 2 (4,3), 3 (4,4), 4 (4,5), 5 (3,5), 6 (2,5), 7 (1,5), 8 (1,4), 9 (1,3), 10 (1,2), 11 (1,1), 12 (2,1), 13 (3,1), 14 (4,1), 15 (5,1), 16 (6,1) and (6,2) is 17? (6,1) is position 15, (6,2) is position 16, tail.\n\nAfter removing tail (5,2), the segment before was (6,2)? Before move, positions: (4,3) head, (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2) tail.\n\nSo when move to (4,2), no eat, so head to (4,2), and the body is from (4,3) to (6,2), so positions: head (4,2), then (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), ..., (6,1), (6,2) — and (5,2) is removed. So (6,2) is now the tail.\n\nNumber: from (4,3) to (6,2) is 14 segments? (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) — that's 16 positions including head? Head (4,2) and 15 body segments? Body has 15 cells from (4,3) to (6,2).\n\n(4,3) to (6,2) is 14 cells? List: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) — 16 cells, but head is (4,2), so total 17 positions? I'm confused.\n\nEasier: after turn 66, snake has 17 segments.\n\nMove to (4,2) no eat, so head to new position (4,2), tail removed, so 16 segments: head (4,2) and body from (4,3) to (6,2) minus the removed tail, but tail was (5,2), so body is (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), ..., (6,1), (6,2) — and (5,2) is gone, so the body is continuous except (5,2) missing, but since it's a line, the positions are (4,2) head, then (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) tail.\n\n(5,1) to (6,1) to (6,2), so (6,2) is tail.\n\nNow, at turn 68, from (4,2) move to (3,2) to eat food.\n\n(3,2) has food, so eat, grow to 17.\n\nNo immediate danger.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nIn this path, I eat all three foods by turn 68.\n\nIf I do other moves, I might not get all.\n\nSo moving right at turn 64 seems best.\n\nBut at turn 64, moving right to (4,5) might have a risk if I cannot escape, but in this case, I can go down to eat the other foods.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (3,2) is near the tail, but tail is moving.\n\nIn the sequence, when I move to (3,2) at turn 68, tail is at (6,2), not adjacent, so no tail reward danger.\n\nSo it should be safe.\n\nTherefore, for turn 64, I should move right to eat (4,5).\n\nThen for subsequent turns, as above.\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the state might change, but since no other events, I can plan a few turns.\n\nThe answer format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but I need to specify how many.\n\nIt says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but output format is to list actions starting from current turn.\n\nAnd since the state is given, I can simulate.\n\nBut after each move, the state changes, so I should plan a sequence.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns: turn 64 to 68 or 69.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nSince I have a plan, I can list:\n\nTurn 64: R (to eat (4,5))\n\nTurn 65: D (to (4,4))\n\nTurn 66: D (to (4,3) eat)\n\nThen at turn 67, from (4,3), move D to (4,2)\n\nBut at turn 67, after turn 66, head at (4,3), I move D to (4,2)\n\nThen turn 68: move L to (3,2) to eat.\n\nBut turn 68 is t1+4.\n\nt1=64, so turn 64,65,66,67,68.\n\nBut for turn 67, I move to (4,2), which is not eating, but necessary to reach (3,2).\n\nThen turn 68: move L to (3,2) eat.\n\nNow, after that, I can stop or continue, but the output might be for several turns.\n\nBut the format says to list actions, so I can do for 5 turns.\n\nt1 to t1+4 or something.\n\nBut let's confirm the directions.\n\nAlso, for turn 65, when I move from (4,5) to (4,4), direction was down? From (4,5) to (4,4) is down, so direction down.\n\nThen turn 66 from (4,4) to (4,3) down again.\n\nThen turn 67 from (4,3) to (4,2) down.\n\nAt (4,3), direction down, so moving down to (4,2) is fine, not reverse.\n\nThen turn 68 from (4,2) move left to (3,2).\n\nDirection: from (4,3) to (4,2) was down, so at (4,2) direction down, so moving left is not reverse, allowed.\n\n(3,2) has food, eat.\n\nNow, is there any risk in this path?\n\nAt turn 65, when I move to (4,4), it should be empty, as we assumed.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) has food, etc.\n\nAnother point: the internal wall at (4,6) doesn't affect since I'm not going up.\n\nAlso, the snake body: at some points, it might block, but in this path, it seems clear.\n\nFor example, when I am at (4,2), and move to (3,2), (3,2) should be empty except food.\n\nSnake body: at that time, positions include (3,1), (4,1), etc., but not (3,2), so fine.\n\nTherefore, this seems a good plan.\n\nTo think ahead, after eating (3,2), I can go to other areas, but since no more food listed, I need to survive, but for now, I can stop the output.\n\nThe answer should list actions starting from current turn.\n\nSo for turn 64: R\n\nTurn 65: D\n\nTurn 66: D\n\nThen turn 67: D (to (4,2))\n\nBut turn 67: from (4,3) to (4,2) is down.\n\nThen turn 68: L (to (3,2) eat)\n\nBut turn 68 is t1+4.\n\nPerhaps I should include turn 67 and 68.\n\nSince thinking 5 turns ahead, from turn 64 to 68 is 5 turns: 64,65,66,67,68.\n\nt1 to t1+4.\n\nNow, for the actions.\n\nIn turn 66, I move to (4,3) and eat, which is fine.\n\nIs there a better move at some point?\n\nFor example, at turn 64, if I move down to (3,4), then I might not eat (4,5) immediately, but I can eat (4,3) earlier? At turn 64 move D to (3,4), then turn 65 to (4,4), turn 66 to (4,3) eat, same as before, but I missed eating (4,5) at turn 64, so I get one less food so far.\n\nThen I need to go to (4,5) later, which might be harder.\n\nFor example, from (4,3) after eating, I have to go to (5,3) or something to access (4,5), but (4,4) is body, so I cannot go directly.\n\nSo it might take more turns, and I might not eat (4,5) if something happens, but life_span long, but still, better to eat when possible.\n\nSo moving right at turn 64 is better.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with that.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 64: R\n\nTurn 65: D\n\nTurn 66: D\n\nTurn 67: D\n\nTurn 68: L\n\nBut for turn 67 and 68, I have moves, but in the output, I need to specify.\n\nSince the state might have changes, but in this case, no new food or anything, so it should be fine.\n\nTo be precise, I can output for turns 64 to 68.\n\nBut turn 68 is eating (3,2), which is good.\n\nNow, for the boxed answer.\n\nAlso, the head direction after each move, but I think the actions define it.\n\nIn the sequence, directions are consistent.\n\nSo I think this is good.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, the strategy involves eating the accessible positive food efficiently, considering their life spans and avoiding collisions. The food at (4,5) has a life span of 7, but it can be eaten immediately on turn 64 by moving right, providing an immediate score increase. The food at (4,3) has a shorter life span of 4 and must be eaten by turn 67 to avoid expiration. The food at (3,2) has a long life span of 10, so it can be eaten later without urgency.\n\nThe snake starts at (3,5) with direction right. Moving right to (4,5) on turn 64 eats the food there, growing the snake. From (4,5), moving down to (4,4) on turn 65 positions the snake to eat (4,3) on turn 66. After eating (4,3), moving down to (4,2) on turn 67 sets up the move to (3,2) on turn 68 to eat the final food.\n\nThis sequence eats all available food by turn 68, maximizing score with minimal risk. The path avoids walls and body collisions:\n- On turn 64, moving right to (4,5) is safe: no wall or body collision, and the tail is not adjacent, so no tail reward danger.\n- On turn 65, moving down to (4,4) is safe and positions for (4,3).\n- On turn 66, moving down to (4,3) eats the food; (4,4) is body, but moving down is allowed (not reverse), and (4,3) is free.\n- On turn 67, moving down to (4,2) is safe; no food, so tail moves.\n- On turn 68, moving left to (3,2) eats the food; direction is down, so left is allowed, and (3,2) is free.\n\nThinking 5+ turns ahead confirms safety:\n- After turn 68, the snake can explore open areas (e.g., left to (2,2) or down to (3,1), avoiding walls and body).\n- All food is consumed, and the snake survives with increased length for future opportunities.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 64: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 65: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 66: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 67: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 68: L (left)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but I need to be careful because there's an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nCurrent turn is t=65.\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (4,5), and the body segments follow: (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2). That's 16 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n\nHead direction is right, so it's moving east.\n\nFood:\n\n- At (4,3) with value 1 and life span 3. So it will disappear after 3 turns, including this one, so if not eaten by turn 67, it's gone.\n\n- At (3,2) with value 1 and life span 9. It has more time.\n\nI need to plan moves for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid is 6x6 from (1,1) to (6,6), but walls are at borders, so cells (1,1) to (6,6) are playable except obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), so (4,6) is blocked.\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (4,5)\n\nBody: (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2)\n\nSo the snake is coiled around the left and bottom. From head at (4,5), it goes left to (1,5), then down to (1,1), then right to (6,1), then up to (6,2)? (6,2) is listed, but (6,1) to (6,2) is up, then (5,2), which is left, then (4,2).\n\nList of positions:\n\nIndex 0: (4,5) head\n\n1: (3,5)\n\n2: (2,5)\n\n3: (1,5)\n\n4: (1,4)\n\n5: (1,3)\n\n6: (1,2)\n\n7: (1,1)\n\n8: (2,1)\n\n9: (3,1)\n\n10: (4,1)\n\n11: (5,1)\n\n12: (6,1)\n\n13: (6,2)\n\n14: (5,2)\n\n15: (4,2) tail\n\nSo the tail is at (4,2).\n\nFood at (4,3) and (3,2).\n\n(4,3) is directly below the head? Head at (4,5), so (4,3) is two cells down, but there might be body in between.\n\nCurrent positions: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2)\n\n(4,3) is not occupied by snake, I think. Let's see: x=4, y=3? Positions: y=5 has (4,5),(3,5),(2,5),(1,5); y=4 has (1,4); y=3 has (1,3); y=2 has (1,2), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2); y=1 has (1,1),(2,1),etc. So (4,3) is free? No, y=3 has only (1,3), so (4,3) should be empty. Similarly, (3,2): y=2 has (1,2), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2). (3,2) not listed, so free.\n\nFood at (4,3) and (3,2) are both on the grid and not occupied by snake.\n\nHead at (4,5), direction right. So possible moves: since head direction is R, I can go U, D, R, but not L because that would be reverse, and rule says no instant reverse.\n\nCurrent direction is R, so I can go U (up), D (down), R (right), but not L (left) because left is opposite of right.\n\nNow, let's see what each move does.\n\nIf I move right to (5,5): what is there? (5,5) is not in snake positions, and not a wall. Walls are at borders, x=0,7 y=0,7, so (5,5) is safe? But internal obstacle is (4,6), not (5,5). (5,5) should be free.\n\nSnake positions: (4,5) head, then (3,5), etc. (5,5) not listed, so empty.\n\nSimilarly, if I move up to (4,6): but (4,6) is an internal obstacle, so wall, cannot move there.\n\nIf I move down to (4,4): (4,4) not in snake positions, should be free.\n\ny=4: only (1,4) listed, so (4,4) free.\n\nBut I have to consider the body.\n\nFirst, possible actions at turn 65:\n\n- U (up): to (4,6), but (4,6) is wall, so impossible. Deadly collision.\n\n- D (down): to (4,4), which should be free.\n\n- R (right): to (5,5), free.\n\n- L (left): to (3,5), but (3,5) is the first body segment. But rule: body collision if head touches any body segment except the tail, because tail will move.\n\nLet's read collision rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, (3,5) is the first body segment, not tail. Tail is at (4,2). So moving to (3,5) would be body collision, death.\n\nTherefore, at turn 65, possible moves: D or R.\n\nL is impossible because it's reverse and also body.\n\nU is wall.\n\nSo only D or R.\n\nNow, I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nFood at (4,3) has life span 3, meaning it disappears after turn 67? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 65, life span 3, so after 3 turns: turn 65,66,67. On turn 67 it disappears, so must be eaten by turn 66 or 67? When can it be eaten?\n\nFood can be eaten when head moves onto it on the turn it exists.\n\nLife span decreases each turn, including the current turn when it is present.\n\nSo for food at (4,3), life span 3 at turn 65:\n\n- Turn 65: present\n\n- Turn 66: present if life span >1 after decrease? Let's see: at turn 65, life span=3. After turn 65, it decreases to 2. Still present.\n\n- Turn 66: after turn, decreases to 1, still present.\n\n- Turn 67: after turn, decreases to 0, disappears. So on turn 67, it is present but after move, it might be eaten or disappear.\n\nTypically, food is present at the beginning of the turn and can be eaten during the turn if head moves to it. Then after the move, life span decreases.\n\nThe rule says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nI think it's standard: at the start of turn, food is there with life span L. If head moves to it, it is eaten. Then at end of turn, life span decreases by 1. If life span becomes 0, it disappears.\n\nFor (4,3), at turn 65, life span=3. After turn 65, it becomes 2. After turn 66, becomes 1. After turn 67, becomes 0, disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 65, 66, or 67.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) life span 9, so plenty of time.\n\nNow, head at (4,5). If I move down to (4,4) on turn 65, then I'm closer to (4,3).\n\nIf I move right to (5,5), I'm away from it.\n\nBut (4,3) has short life, so I might want to eat it soon.\n\nAlso, there's food at (3,2), but that has longer life.\n\nMoreover, I need to avoid risks.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving down to (4,4) on turn 65.\n\nThen, from (4,4), I can go to (4,3) to eat the food, but (4,3) is food, and if I move down to (4,3) on turn 66, I eat it.\n\nBut is it safe? Let's see the snake body.\n\nAfter moving down to (4,4), the snake positions will be: head at (4,4), then body: the previous head (4,5) becomes body, so positions: [(4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), ..., up to tail (4,2)? When snake moves, the head moves to new position, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it. Tail moves away from its position.\n\nCurrent positions before move: head (4,5), then (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2) tail.\n\nIf I move down to (4,4), new head at (4,4). Then the body: segment 1 moves to previous head (4,5), segment 2 to previous segment 1 (3,5), and so on. Segment 15 moves to previous segment 14 position, which is (5,2)? Let's list new positions after move down:\n\n- New head: (4,4)\n\n- New body: [ (4,5) from old head, (3,5) from old seg1, (2,5) from old seg2, (1,5) from old seg3, (1,4) from old seg4, (1,3) from old seg5, (1,2) from old seg6, (1,1) from old seg7, (2,1) from old seg8, (3,1) from old seg9, (4,1) from old seg10, (5,1) from old seg11, (6,1) from old seg12, (6,2) from old seg13, (5,2) from old seg14 ]\n\nOld tail was (4,2), which is segment 15. After move, segment 14 (old seg14) was at (5,2), moves to position of old seg13? Better to think: the tail is the last segment. After move, the segment that was second last moves to where the last was, but since head moved, the body shifts.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the tail cell is vacated, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the chain.\n\nSo after moving head to (4,4):\n\n- The first body segment is now at (4,5) (previous head position)\n\n- Second at (3,5) (previous position of first body)\n\n- ...\n\n- The 15th segment (tail) was at (4,2), but since the body shifts, the segment that was at index 14 (5,2) moves to the position of index 13? Positions: let's number indices.\n\nBefore move:\n\nIndex 0: (4,5) head\n\n1: (3,5)\n\n2: (2,5)\n\n3: (1,5)\n\n4: (1,4)\n\n5: (1,3)\n\n6: (1,2)\n\n7: (1,1)\n\n8: (2,1)\n\n9: (3,1)\n\n10: (4,1)\n\n11: (5,1)\n\n12: (6,1)\n\n13: (6,2)\n\n14: (5,2)\n\n15: (4,2) tail\n\nAfter move down to (4,4):\n\nNew head at (4,4)\n\nNew body:\n\n- Segment 1 (first after head) at old head position (4,5)\n\n- Segment 2 at old segment 1 position (3,5)\n\n- Segment 3 at old segment 2 position (2,5)\n\n- Segment 4 at old segment 3 position (1,5)\n\n- Segment 5 at old segment 4 position (1,4)\n\n- Segment 6 at old segment 5 position (1,3)\n\n- Segment 7 at old segment 6 position (1,2)\n\n- Segment 8 at old segment 7 position (1,1)\n\n- Segment 9 at old segment 8 position (2,1)\n\n- Segment 10 at old segment 9 position (3,1)\n\n- Segment 11 at old segment 10 position (4,1)\n\n- Segment 12 at old segment 11 position (5,1)\n\n- Segment 13 at old segment 12 position (6,1)\n\n- Segment 14 at old segment 13 position (6,2)\n\n- Segment 15 (tail) at old segment 14 position (5,2)\n\nOld segment 14 was at (5,2), so tail moves to (5,2). But old tail (4,2) is now vacated.\n\nNew tail is at (5,2).\n\nNow, from (4,4), I can move to (4,3) on turn 66, which has the food.\n\n(4,3) is food, value +1.\n\nIf I move down to (4,3) on turn 66, I eat it, so snake grows: when I eat food, the tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n\nAfter eating, the head moves to food, and the tail stays, so new segment added.\n\nIn this case, on turn 66, if head moves to (4,3), which is food, then after move, the head is at (4,3), and the tail does not move, so the snake gains a segment.\n\nCurrent positions after turn 65 move down: head (4,4), body segments as above, tail at (5,2).\n\nOn turn 66, move down to (4,3): (4,3) is food, so eat it. New head at (4,3), and since food eaten, tail does not move, so the body: the previous head (4,4) becomes new body segment, and the tail remains, so snake has 17 segments now.\n\nPositions: head (4,3), then (4,4), then (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2) tail.\n\n(5,2) is tail, and it didn't move.\n\nBut is this safe? After eating, the tail is at (5,2), and head at (4,3).\n\nNow, what about the other food at (3,2)? (3,2) is near.\n\nBut let's see if moving to (4,3) is risky.\n\nFirst, from head at (4,4), moving down to (4,3) is possible, and (4,3) is not occupied by body because after turn 65, body is at (4,5), (3,5), etc., and (4,3) is free except for the food.\n\nIn the positions above, after turn 65, cells occupied: (4,4) head, (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2). So (4,3) is not occupied, so moving to (4,3) is safe.\n\nThen after eating, head at (4,3), and body includes (4,4), etc.\n\nNow, direction: when I move down to (4,4) on turn 65, head direction becomes D (down). Then on turn 66, moving down to (4,3), direction still D, so I can go U, D, L, R, but U would be reverse, so not U, but I can go L, R, or D again? Direction is down, so moving up is reverse, not allowed. Moving left or right or down is ok.\n\nBut from (4,3), I need to think further.\n\nBut let's consider the other move option: at turn 65, move right to (5,5).\n\nIf I move right to (5,5) on turn 65.\n\nThen new head at (5,5), direction R.\n\nNew positions: head (5,5), body: (4,5) from old head, (3,5) from old seg1, (2,5) from old seg2, (1,5) from old seg3, (1,4) from old seg4, (1,3) from old seg5, (1,2) from old seg6, (1,1) from old seg7, (2,1) from old seg8, (3,1) from old seg9, (4,1) from old seg10, (5,1) from old seg11, (6,1) from old seg12, (6,2) from old seg13, (5,2) from old seg14, and tail at (4,2) from old seg15? Old tail was (4,2), but after move, the segment that was tail moves to where? Similar to before.\n\nAfter move right to (5,5):\n\n- Head: (5,5)\n\n- Body: [ (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2) ]\n\nTail at (5,2)? Old segment 14 was (5,2), so it becomes the new tail position? Let's see: old segment 14 was at (5,2), and since the body shifts, it moves to position of old segment 13? No.\n\nStandard: the cell that was tail is vacated, and each body segment moves forward.\n\nSo after head moves to (5,5):\n\n- Segment 1 at (4,5) old head\n\n- Segment 2 at (3,5) old seg1\n\n- ...\n- Segment 15 at old seg14 position (5,2)\n\nOld seg14 was (5,2), so new tail at (5,2). Old tail (4,2) vacated.\n\nNow, from (5,5), I can move to other places, but the food at (4,3) is south-west, and I have only 2 turns to eat it.\n\nFrom (5,5), to reach (4,3), I need to go left and down, but left would be to (4,5), which is now occupied by body.\n\nAfter turn 65 move right, positions include (4,5) as body, so (4,5) is occupied.\n\nIf I try to go down from (5,5) to (5,4), but (5,4) might be free, then to (5,3), etc., but (4,3) is at x=4, y=3.\n\nFrom (5,5), if I go down to (5,4), then to (5,3), then left to (4,3) or (5,2), but (5,2) is tail or body.\n\nAfter turn 65, (5,2) is tail, but on next moves, it might move.\n\nBut let's see the timeline.\n\nTurn 65: if I move right to (5,5), then on turn 66, I can move, say, down to (5,4), or left to (4,5) but (4,5) is body, collision, or right to (6,5), or up to (5,6).\n\n(5,6): y=6, not wall, and no obstacle mentioned except (4,6), so (5,6) should be free.\n\nBut (4,3) food must be eaten by turn 67.\n\nIf on turn 65 I move right to (5,5), then on turn 66, if I move down to (5,4), then on turn 67, I can move left to (4,4) or down to (5,3), etc.\n\nTo reach (4,3) from (5,4) on turn 67, I could go left to (4,4) or down to (5,3), then from there to (4,3).\n\nBut (4,4) might be free or not.\n\nAfter turn 65 move right, positions: head (5,5), body (4,5), (3,5), ..., down to tail (5,2).\n\n(4,4) is not occupied, I think. y=4: only (1,4) in the list, so (4,4) free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) free.\n\nSo on turn 66, from (5,5), move down to (5,4).\n\nThen positions: head (5,4), body (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), ..., and tail: since head moved, body shifts, new tail at old seg14 position or something. After move, segment 1 at (5,5), segment 2 at (4,5), etc., down to segment 15 at (6,2) or let's not list all, assume (4,4) free.\n\nThen on turn 67, from (5,4), I can move left to (4,4) or down to (5,3), etc.\n\nIf I move left to (4,4) on turn 67, (4,4) is free, then I'm at (4,4), and (4,3) is below, but food at (4,3) can be eaten on turn 67 if I move there.\n\nBut on turn 67, life span of (4,3) is: at turn 65, life=3, after turn 65, life=2; after turn 66, life=1; after turn 67, it disappears, but at the start of turn 67, life=1, so if I move to (4,3) on turn 67, I can eat it before it disappears.\n\nThen I eat it.\n\nBut from (4,4), moving down to (4,3) on turn 67.\n\nBut is (4,3) safe? At that time, the body positions depend on previous moves.\n\nIt might be possible, but it's tight, and I have to go through multiple steps, whereas if I move down directly on turn 65 and 66, I eat it sooner with less risk.\n\nMoreover, moving right might lead to other issues.\n\nBut there is another food at (3,2) with longer life.\n\nBut (4,3) is about to disappear, so I should prioritize eating it if possible.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid the tail reward danger.\n\nTail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (4,2) or moving.\n\nFirst, let's consider the down move on turn 65.\n\nMove D to (4,4) on turn 65.\n\nThen on turn 66, move D to (4,3) to eat food.\n\nAfter eating, head at (4,3), body: as above, including (4,4), (4,5), etc., tail at (5,2).\n\nNow, from (4,3), I need to move somewhere on turn 67.\n\nDirection is down, so I can go L, R, or D, but not U (up).\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- L (left) to (3,3): is (3,3) free? After turn 66, positions: head (4,3), body (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2) tail.\n\nSo (3,3) not occupied, should be free.\n\n- R (right) to (5,3): (5,3) not occupied, free.\n\n- D (down) to (4,2): but (4,2) is not in positions, but after turn 66, tail is at (5,2), so (4,2) should be free? Positions include (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2), but not (4,2), so (4,2) free.\n\n(4,2) is the position where tail was at turn 65, but after moves, it might be free.\n\nIn turn 66, after moving to (4,3) and eating, positions as above, (4,2) not listed, so free.\n\nBut there is food at (3,2), which is (3,2).\n\n(3,2) is not adjacent to head yet.\n\nHead at (4,3), tail at (5,2).\n\nIf I move down to (4,2) on turn 67, (4,2) is free, no food, so no issue.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (3,2) or elsewhere.\n\nBut (3,2) has food.\n\nNow, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it is dangerous.\n\nHere, tail is at (5,2), head at (4,3), so they are adjacent? (4,3) and (5,2) are diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n\nSo (4,3) and (5,2) are not adjacent; they are diagonal.\n\nAdjacent cells are: for (4,3), (4,4) north, (4,2) south, (3,3) west, (5,3) east.\n\nTail is at (5,2), which is south-east, not adjacent.\n\nSo no adjacency, so no danger.\n\nI can move to (4,2) or other places.\n\nNow, the food at (3,2) is to the left.\n\nI could move left to (3,3) first, then down to (3,2) to eat it.\n\n(3,2) has life span 9, so plenty of time.\n\nBut let's think about the internal obstacle at (4,6), which might block some moves.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the grid space.\n\nAfter eating (4,3), the snake is longer, and the grid is small, 6x6 minus obstacle, so 35 cells, snake has 17 segments, so 18 free cells, but with food, etc.\n\nBut I need to survive long term.\n\nAnother thing: the tail is at (5,2), and if I move, it will move.\n\nBut let's plan a sequence.\n\nFirst, at turn 65, move D to (4,4).\n\nThen turn 66, move D to (4,3) to eat food.\n\nNow, head at (4,3), direction D.\n\nOn turn 67, I need to move. Options: L to (3,3), R to (5,3), or D to (4,2).\n\nIf I move D to (4,2), then head at (4,2), which is adjacent to tail? Tail at (5,2), so (4,2) and (5,2) are adjacent horizontally.\n\nAfter moving to (4,2), new head at (4,2), body: (4,3) from previous head, (4,4), etc., and tail: since no food eaten, tail moves. Previous tail was at (5,2), and since head moved to (4,2), the segment that was at (4,3) becomes body, and tail moves to where? The last body segment moves to the position of the second last.\n\nAfter turn 67 move to (4,2) without eating (since no food there):\n\n- Head: (4,2)\n\n- Body: [ (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), ..., up to (5,2)? Previous positions before turn 67: head (4,3), body (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2) tail.\n\nAfter move to (4,2):\n\n- Head: (4,2)\n\n- Body: [ (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) ]\n\nNew tail at (6,2)? Segment 16 moves to old segment 15 position (5,2), but old segment 15 was (5,2), so new tail at (5,2)? Let's index.\n\nBefore turn 67: positions: 0: (4,3) head, 1: (4,4), 2: (4,5), 3: (3,5), 4: (2,5), 5: (1,5), 6: (1,4), 7: (1,3), 8: (1,2), 9: (1,1), 10: (2,1), 11: (3,1), 12: (4,1), 13: (5,1), 14: (6,1), 15: (6,2), 16: (5,2) tail (since 17 segments).\n\nAfter move to (4,2):\n\nHead: (4,2)\n\nBody: [ (4,3) old head, (4,4) old seg1, (4,5) old seg2, (3,5) old seg3, ..., up to old seg15 (6,2), and tail at old seg16 (5,2) ]\n\nOld seg16 was (5,2), so new tail at (5,2).\n\nSo head at (4,2), tail at (5,2), they are adjacent, sharing a cell? No, (4,2) and (5,2) are adjacent.\n\nNow, (4,2) has no food, so no issue.\n\nBut the food at (3,2) is at (3,2), which is adjacent to (4,2)? (4,2) and (3,2) are adjacent left.\n\nIf I move to (3,2) on next turn, I can eat it, but need to check tail reward danger.\n\nFirst, on turn 67, if I moved to (4,2), head at (4,2), direction down? From (4,3) to (4,2), so direction D.\n\nThen on turn 68, I can move L to (3,2), which has food.\n\n(3,2) is food, value +1.\n\nIf I move to (3,2), I eat it, so snake grows.\n\nBut head is at (4,2), tail at (5,2), they are adjacent.\n\nIf I move to (3,2), which is left of head, so to (3,2).\n\nAfter eating, head at (3,2), and tail does not move, so tail remains at (5,2).\n\nNow, new head at (3,2), body: (4,2) from old head, (4,3), etc.\n\nTail at (5,2).\n\nNow, are head and tail adjacent? (3,2) and (5,2) are not adjacent; there is (4,2) in between.\n\n(3,2) and (5,2) are two cells apart, not adjacent.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut let's see if there is a risk.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (4,6) might not affect immediately.\n\nBut I need to think about the other move option at turn 65.\n\nSuppose at turn 65 I move right to (5,5).\n\nThen on turn 66, say I move down to (5,4).\n\nThen on turn 67, I can move left to (4,4) or down to (5,3), etc.\n\nIf I move left to (4,4) on turn 67, then (4,4) might be free, as before.\n\nThen from (4,4), I can move down to (4,3) to eat food on turn 67, if it's still there.\n\nBut on turn 67, food at (4,3) is present, life span 1, so I can eat it.\n\nThen I get the food.\n\nBut compared to the first plan, this takes an extra move and I have to go to (5,5) first, which might be less efficient.\n\nMoreover, from (5,5), I could go other ways, but I might miss the food if not careful.\n\nIn the first plan, I eat it on turn 66, which is earlier.\n\nAlso, after eating (4,3), I can go for (3,2).\n\nNow, back to the sequence with move down on turn 65.\n\nTurn 65: D to (4,4)\n\nTurn 66: D to (4,3) eat food\n\nNow head at (4,3), direction D.\n\nOn turn 67, I need to move. I could go to (3,3) or (5,3) or (4,2).\n\nIf I go to (3,3), then I'm closer to (3,2).\n\n(3,3) to (3,2) is down.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) to (3,2) is left.\n\nBut let's choose to go to (3,3) on turn 67.\n\nMove L to (3,3) from (4,3).\n\nDirection: from (4,3) to (3,3), so left, direction L.\n\n(3,3) should be free, as per earlier positions.\n\nAfter move to (3,3):\n\nHead: (3,3)\n\nBody: [ (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), ... ] tail at (5,2) or something.\n\nBefore turn 67 move: head (4,3), body (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), ..., (5,2) tail.\n\nMove left to (3,3):\n\nHead: (3,3)\n\nBody: [ (4,3) old head, (4,4) old seg1, (4,5) old seg2, (3,5) old seg3, ..., up to old seg16 (5,2) ]\n\nNew tail at old seg16 position? Old seg16 was (5,2), so tail at (5,2).\n\nNow head at (3,3), tail at (5,2), not adjacent.\n\nOn turn 68, I can move down to (3,2) to eat the food at (3,2).\n\n(3,2) is food, move down to (3,2), eat it.\n\nNew head at (3,2), body: (3,3) old head, (4,3), etc., tail remains at (5,2) since food eaten.\n\nThen snake longer.\n\nNow, all good.\n\nBut I need to think about further turns for survival.\n\nThe grid has limited space, and snake is long.\n\nFree cells: total cells 6x6=36, minus obstacle (4,6), so 35 cells.\n\nSnake has 16 segments initially, after eating two foods, 18 segments, so 17 free cells left? 35-18=17 free, but with no other food, but food might respawn, but not mentioned, so I think only these two for now.\n\nBut I need to avoid boxing myself.\n\nCurrent positions after eating both foods, but let's not get ahead.\n\nAnother move option at turn 65: move right to (5,5), then I might not eat (4,3) if I delay, but I can still eat it on turn 67 as I thought earlier.\n\nBut moving right might be safer or riskier.\n\nFor example, from (5,5), if I go down to (5,4), then left to (4,4), then down to (4,3) on turn 67.\n\nBut on turn 67, when I move to (4,3), what are the body positions?\n\nAfter turn 65: move R to (5,5), positions: head (5,5), body (4,5), (3,5), ..., tail (5,2)\n\nTurn 66: move D to (5,4), positions: head (5,4), body (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), ..., tail (6,2) or something. After move down, body: (5,5) old head, (4,5) old seg1, etc., tail at old seg16 position, say (6,2) if that was last.\n\nEarlier, after turn 65, tail at (5,2)\n\nAfter turn 66 move to (5,4): head (5,4), body (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), ..., and segment 16 moves to old seg15 position? Before turn 66: positions: 0:(5,5) head, 1:(4,5), 2:(3,5), 3:(1,5)? Better not.\n\nAssume (4,4) free.\n\nOn turn 67, move L to (4,4) from (5,4).\n\n(4,4) free, move left.\n\nThen head at (4,4), direction L (since left from (5,4)).\n\nThen move D to (4,3) to eat food.\n\nBut on turn 67, eating (4,3).\n\nIt works, but I used three moves instead of two to get the food, so less efficient.\n\nMoreover, by turn 67, I might have other opportunities.\n\nBut since the food has short life, better to eat it early.\n\nAlso, in the first plan, after eating (4,3) on turn 66, I can start moving towards (3,2) earlier.\n\nNow, about the tail reward danger with (3,2).\n\nIn the first plan, when I go to (3,3) or (4,2), and then to (3,2).\n\nSuppose at some point head is adjacent to tail and tail has food.\n\nBut in this case, tail is at (5,2), and (3,2) is not near, so when I eat (3,2), tail is elsewhere.\n\nFor example, if I move to (3,2) when tail is at (5,2), not adjacent.\n\nBut suppose before eating, if head is near tail and the cell has food.\n\nBut (3,2) is food, and tail might move there or not.\n\nIn the sequence, when I approach (3,2), tail is at (5,2) or moving away.\n\nIn the first plan, after turn 67 at (3,3), tail at (5,2), then move to (3,2) on turn 68, eat, tail still at (5,2), not adjacent.\n\nSafe.\n\nIf I had gone to (4,2) first, same thing.\n\nNow, another risk: the internal obstacle at (4,6) might block the top, but since I'm at bottom, not immediate.\n\nI should consider moving right to explore more space, but with the snake coiled, moving right might lead to dead ends.\n\nFor example, from (5,5), I can go to (6,5), but (6,5) might be free, then to (6,6), but (6,6) is not wall? Walls are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (6,6) is playable.\n\nx from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\n(6,6) is corner.\n\nBut there might be body.\n\nAfter moving to (5,5), (6,5) might be free, etc.\n\nBut I have to eat (4,3) soon.\n\nMoreover, (4,3) is positive food, so I should eat it.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) is positive.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should eat both, and survive.\n\nBut survival: the snake is long, so I need to find a path to not trap myself.\n\nCurrently, the snake is mostly on the left and bottom, so moving down or right might open space.\n\nIn the move down case, I go to (4,4), (4,3), then to (3,3) or (4,2), then to (3,2).\n\nAfter eating (3,2), head at (3,2), and the body is around.\n\nThen I need to move somewhere.\n\nFor example, from (3,2), I can go to (3,1) but (3,1) is body? After eating (3,2), positions: head (3,2), body (3,3) if I came from there, or (4,2), etc., but (3,1) might be occupied.\n\nIn the sequence, when I eat (3,2), previous head was at (3,3) or (4,2).\n\nSuppose I was at (3,3) and moved down to (3,2).\n\nThen body: (3,3), (4,3), etc., and tail at (5,2) or moving.\n\n(3,1) is likely occupied by body, since earlier positions had (3,1).\n\nFor example, before eating (3,2), positions included (3,1) as body.\n\nAfter moves, it might still be there.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2), etc.\n\nI need to have a path to open areas.\n\nPerhaps moving right initially gives more space.\n\nLet's list free cells to see.\n\nInitial free cells: grid (1,1) to (6,6) minus walls, minus obstacle (4,6), minus snake positions.\n\nSnake positions: (4,5),(3,5),(2,5),(1,5),(1,4),(1,3),(1,2),(1,1),(2,1),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(5,2),(4,2)\n\nSo occupied: all these.\n\nFree cells: for x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 except (4,6) obstacle.\n\nBut (4,6) is wall, so not free.\n\nFree: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (5,6), (6,6) — y=6\n\ny=5: (5,5), (6,5) — since (4,5),(3,5),(2,5),(1,5) occupied, (5,5) and (6,5) free? (1,5) to (4,5) occupied, (5,5) not, (6,5) not.\n\nx=5,y=5: (5,5) not in positions, free.\n\nx=6,y=5: (6,5) not, free.\n\ny=4: (2,4),(3,4),(4,4),(5,4),(6,4) — (1,4) occupied, so others free.\n\ny=3: (2,3),(3,3),(4,3) food, (5,3),(6,3) — (1,3) occupied.\n\ny=2: (2,2),(3,2) food, (5,2) occupied? (5,2) is tail, occupied, (4,2) occupied, (1,2) occupied, (6,2) occupied, so y=2: (2,2) and (3,2) free? (3,2) is food, but cell is free except for food.\n\n(2,2) not occupied, free.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 all occupied except? x=1 to 6 y=1: (1,1),(2,1),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1) all occupied.\n\ny=6: (1,6),(2,6),(3,6),(5,6),(6,6) free, since (4,6) wall.\n\nAlso, (3,4),(4,4), etc.\n\nFree cells: (1,6),(2,6),(3,6),(5,6),(6,6), (5,5),(6,5), (2,4),(3,4),(4,4),(5,4),(6,4), (2,3),(3,3),(4,3),(5,3),(6,3), (2,2),(3,2), and that's all? y=2 has (2,2),(3,2) free, others occupied.\n\n(4,3) has food, but cell exists.\n\nNumber: top row y=6: 5 cells free (x=1,2,3,5,6)\n\ny=5: (5,5),(6,5) free, 2 cells\n\ny=4: x=2,3,4,5,6 free, 5 cells (x=1 occupied)\n\ny=3: x=2,3,4,5,6 free except (4,3) food, but free for movement, 5 cells\n\ny=2: x=2,3 free ( (2,2),(3,2) ), x=1,4,5,6 occupied, so 2 cells\n\ny=1: all occupied, 0\n\nPlus (4,3) and (3,2) have food, but cells are included.\n\nTotal free: 5+2+5+5+2=19, but with two food, so 17 empty cells.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows, free cells decrease.\n\nBut I need to move to open areas.\n\nIn the first plan, by moving down and left, I stay in the bottom-left, which might be congested.\n\nIf I move right to (5,5), I go to the right side, which has more free cells, like (5,5),(6,5),(6,4), etc.\n\nThen I can eat (4,3) later or not.\n\nBut (4,3) must be eaten soon.\n\nI can eat it on turn 67.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nTurn 65: move R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 66: move D to (5,4)  // down to (5,4)\n\nThen turn 67: move L to (4,4)  // left to (4,4)\n\nThen from (4,4), move D to (4,3) to eat on turn 67.\n\nBut on turn 67, from (4,4), moving down to (4,3), which is possible if (4,3) is free and food present.\n\nAfter turn 66: if at (5,4), and move to (4,4), then head at (4,4), and (4,3) should be below.\n\nBut what about the body? After turn 66 at (5,4), positions include (5,5), etc., (4,4) should be free.\n\nThen move to (4,4) on turn 67, then to (4,3).\n\nBut when I move to (4,3) on turn 67, I eat it.\n\nSimilarly, I get it.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (3,2).\n\nBut (3,2) has life span 9, so I have time.\n\nIn this case, I used three moves to eat the first food, whereas in down move, two moves.\n\nBut in the right move, I moved to a less congested area.\n\nBut after eating, I'm at (4,3), same as before.\n\nThen I can go to (3,3) or (4,2), etc., to (3,2).\n\nSimilar.\n\nBut in the down move, I start from (4,3) on turn 66, and can be at (3,3) on turn 67, then (3,2) on turn 68.\n\nIn right move, I am at (4,3) on turn 67, then on turn 68 I can go to (3,3) or (4,2), then to (3,2) on turn 69, so slower for the second food.\n\nBut since (3,2) has long life, it's ok.\n\nFor survival, moving right might open more space.\n\nBut there's a risk with the food at (4,3) if I don't eat it on time.\n\nIn both cases, I can eat it by turn 67.\n\nNow, another thing: the tail reward danger.\n\nIn the sequence where I go to (4,2) and then to (3,2).\n\nSuppose on turn 67, I move to (4,2) from (4,3).\n\nThen head at (4,2), and tail is at (5,2), adjacent.\n\nNow, (4,2) has no food, but (3,2) has food, and (3,2) is adjacent to (4,2).\n\nIf on turn 68, I move left to (3,2), which has food, I eat it.\n\nBut when I move to (3,2), the head is moving to a cell that was not tail, and tail is at (5,2), not on (3,2), so no problem.\n\nThe danger is only if the food is under the tail and I eat it when head is adjacent, but here the food is at (3,2), not under tail.\n\nTail is at (5,2), so different cell.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nI think both options are possible, but moving down on turn 65 allows me to eat the short-life food earlier and with fewer moves, so I can then focus on the other food and survival.\n\nMoreover, by moving down, I stay away from the obstacle at (4,6) for now.\n\nSo I think D on turn 65 is better.\n\nThen for turn 66, D to eat.\n\nThen for turn 67, I need to choose a move.\n\nFrom (4,3), I can go to (3,3) to approach (3,2).\n\nOr to (4,2), but (4,2) might be closer to tail or something.\n\nSince (3,2) is west, going left to (3,3) is fine.\n\nThen down to (3,2) on turn 68.\n\nBut I need to think 5 turns ahead, so turns 65 to 69 or 70.\n\nTurn 65: t=65\n\nt66, t67, t68, t69, t70.\n\nAfter eating both foods, I need to survive.\n\nFor example, after eating (3,2) on turn 68, head at (3,2), then I can move to (2,2) or (3,1), but (3,1) might be body, (2,2) might be free.\n\n(2,2) is free initially, and likely still free.\n\nThen to (2,3) or (1,2), but (1,2) is body, so to (2,3), etc.\n\nBut the top has free cells, so I can navigate there.\n\nSimilarly, if I moved right initially, I might be on the right side.\n\nBut I think for now, moving down is efficient for the food.\n\nAlso, the answer format requires actions for multiple turns, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but answer format is to provide actions starting from turn t1, which is 65.\n\nIt says: \"Turn t1: action on turn t1\" etc.\n\nAnd \"think 5+ turns ahead\", so I need to provide a sequence of actions for several turns.\n\nHow many? It doesn't specify, but at least for the immediate decisions.\n\nSince food at (4,3) must be eaten by turn 67, I can plan up to there.\n\nBut to think ahead, I should provide a few moves.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns: turn 65 to 69.\n\nSo let's define the sequence.\n\nTurn 65: move D to (4,4)\n\nTurn 66: move D to (4,3) eat food\n\nTurn 67: move L to (3,3)  // to approach (3,2)\n\nTurn 68: move D to (3,2) eat food\n\nNow head at (3,2), direction D (down).\n\nThen on turn 69, I need to move. Possible moves: from (3,2), direction down, so cannot move up (reverse).\n\nCan move L to (2,2), R to (4,2), or D to (3,1).\n\nBut (3,1) is likely body. After eating (3,2), positions: head (3,2), body (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), etc., and (3,1) is part of body? Earlier positions had (3,1) as segment, and after moves, it might still be there.\n\nFor example, after turn 68 eat at (3,2), body includes (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2) and tail at (5,2) or something, but since I ate, tail didn't move.\n\nWhen I eat at (3,2), new head at (3,2), body: (3,3) from previous head, then (4,3), (4,4), ..., and the previous tail remains, so (3,1) is still there as a body segment.\n\nSo (3,1) is occupied, cannot move there.\n\n(4,2) might be free or not. After previous moves, (4,2) might be free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) should be free.\n\nAnd (3,3) is body, so cannot move up.\n\nSo from (3,2), can move L to (2,2), R to (4,2), or D to (3,1) but occupied, so only L or R.\n\n(3,1) is south, but occupied, so invalid.\n\nSo move L to (2,2) or R to (4,2).\n\n(2,2) is free, (4,2) might be free.\n\nAfter turn 68, positions: head (3,2), body (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2) tail? Since I ate at (3,2), the tail is at (5,2), and positions include all, so (4,2) not occupied, should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) free.\n\nSo I can move to (2,2) or (4,2).\n\nSay, move L to (2,2) on turn 69.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (2,3) or (1,2), but (1,2) body, so to (2,3), etc.\n\nBut I don't need to specify further for the answer.\n\nNow, back to turn 65.\n\nI think moving down is good.\n\nBut what about the move right option?\n\nSuppose at turn 65 move R to (5,5)\n\nThen turn 66 move D to (5,4)\n\nTurn 67 move L to (4,4)\n\nThen turn 67 move D to (4,3) eat\n\nBut on turn 67, from (4,4) to (4,3), eat.\n\nThen on turn 68, from (4,3), I can move L to (3,3), etc., to (3,2) on turn 68 or 69.\n\nBut I eat (4,3) on turn 67 instead of 66, and (3,2) similarly later.\n\nBut with the right move, I have more space on the right.\n\nBut since I have to go left for (3,2), it might not matter.\n\nI think for efficiency, down is better.\n\nMoreover, in the down move, at turn 65 move D, I am at (4,4), then turn 66 D to (4,3), then turn 67 L to (3,3), turn 68 D to (3,2), all good.\n\nWith right move, turn 65 R, turn 66 D, turn 67 L to (4,4), then D to (4,3) on turn 67, same as above, but I was at (5,4) before, which is not necessary.\n\nSo down saves a move.\n\nTherefore, I think D on turn 65 is the best.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 65: D\n\nTurn 66: D\n\nTurn 67: L\n\nTurn 68: D\n\nAnd for turn 69, I can add, say to (2,2) or something, but not necessary.\n\nSince the food at (4,3) is critical, and I eat it early.\n\nAlso, for the answer, I need to provide the sequence.\n\nThe format is to box the actions.\n\nSo for now, I'll go with:\n\nTurn 65: D\n\nTurn 66: D\n\nThen for turn 67, L to (3,3)\n\nTurn 68: D to (3,2) eat\n\nBut turn 68 D to (3,2), which is down from (3,3).\n\nYes.\n\nTo be complete, I can add turn 69.\n\nBut let's see.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I will plan a sequence of moves for at least 5 turns ahead (turns 65 to 69), prioritizing eating the positive food at (4,3) due to its short life span (3 turns, must be eaten by turn 67) while avoiding collisions and considering future paths. The food at (3,2) has a longer life span (9 turns), so it can be eaten later. The snake starts at (4,5) with direction right, and the grid has walls at the borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Immediate Move (Turn 65)**: From (4,5), moving up (U) to (4,6) is impossible (wall collision). Moving left (L) to (3,5) causes body collision (not tail). Only down (D) to (4,4) or right (R) to (5,5) are safe.\n- **Food Priority**: The food at (4,3) must be eaten by turn 67. Moving down on turn 65 allows eating it on turn 66, which is efficient and low-risk. Moving right delays eating until turn 67, increasing risk of missing it and wasting moves.\n- **Path to (3,2)**: After eating (4,3), moving left to (3,3) on turn 67 positions the snake to eat (3,2) on turn 68. This avoids tail reward danger and body collisions.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: After eating both foods, the snake will have 18 segments. Moving to (2,2) on turn 69 opens access to less congested areas (e.g., top-right free cells like (2,3), (2,4), etc.) for future movement, reducing trapping risk.\n- **Collision Avoidance**: All moves are checked for body/wall collisions. No instant reverse is allowed. Tail reward danger is irrelevant here, as the tail is never adjacent to the food cells when eaten.\n\n### Planned Move Sequence (Turns 65-69):\n- **Turn 65 (t=65)**: Move **D (down)** to (4,4).  \n  - *Reason*: Safer and more efficient than moving right, as it positions the snake to eat (4,3) next turn. Direction changes to down.\n- **Turn 66 (t=66)**: Move **D (down)** to (4,3) to eat the positive food (+1 score, length increases to 17).  \n  - *Reason*: (4,3) is free and safe to eat. Life span decreases to 1 after this turn (disappears after turn 67). Direction remains down.\n- **Turn 67 (t=67)**: Move **L (left)** to (3,3).  \n  - *Reason*: Approaches (3,2) without risk. (3,3) is free, and direction changes to left. Moving down to (4,2) or right to (5,3) is possible but less direct for (3,2).\n- **Turn 68 (t=68)**: Move **D (down)** to (3,2) to eat the positive food (+1 score, length increases to 18).  \n  - *Reason*: (3,2) is free and safe to eat. Head and tail (at (5,2)) are not adjacent, so no tail reward danger. Direction changes to down.\n- **Turn 69 (t=69)**: Move **L (left)** to (2,2).  \n  - *Reason*: (2,2) is free and avoids the congested bottom-left. From here, the snake can access open areas like (2,3) or (3,2) for future survival. Moving right to (4,2) or down to (3,1) is unsafe (down leads to body collision at (3,1)).\n\n### Why This Sequence?\n- **Efficiency**: Eats (4,3) on turn 66 (earliest possible) and (3,2) on turn 68, maximizing score with minimal moves.\n- **Risk Mitigation**: Avoids walls, obstacles, and body collisions. All moves are validated for safety.\n- **Long-Term Focus**: After turn 69, the snake can navigate to free cells (e.g., (2,3), (1,6), or rightward) to avoid trapping, with 17 free cells remaining after both foods are eaten.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 65: D \\\\\nTurn 66: D \\\\\nTurn 67: L \\\\\nTurn 68: D \\\\\nTurn 69: L\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with an internal obstacle at (4,6). Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, except where blocked.\n\nSnake positions: head at (4,4), and it's moving down. So current direction is D (down).\n\nFood:\n\n- (4,3) with value 1 and life span 2. Since current turn is 66, it will disappear after turn 67? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 66, life span is 2, meaning it has 2 turns left including this one. So it can be eaten on turn 66 or 67, but not after.\n\nLife span N: disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So for food at (4,3) with life span 2 on turn 66:\n\n- On turn 66, life span 2\n\n- On turn 67, life span 1 (if not eaten)\n\n- On turn 68, it disappears (life span 0)\n\nSimilarly, for (3,2) with life span 8, value 1.\n\nBoth foods have value +1, so they're positive food.\n\nNow, snake positions: let's list them to understand the body.\n\nSnake: [(4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2)]\n\nHead is (4,4), then (4,5), which is above it since y increases up? Typically in grids, y=0 might be top or bottom; I need to clarify the coordinate system.\n\nThe movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y increases upwards? Let's see the directions:\n\nU: (x, y+1) — so y increases as you go up.\n\nD: (x, y-1) — y decreases as you go down.\n\nL: (x-1, y)\n\nR: (x+1, y)\n\nAnd walls: x=0 and x=7 are left and right boundaries, y=0 and y=7 are bottom and top? Since y increases up, y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top.\n\nIn the snake positions, head is (4,4), direction down, so moving to lower y.\n\nPrevious position: since head was at (4,5) before moving to (4,4)? Snake positions are listed head first: [(4,4), (4,5), ...] so (4,4) is current head, (4,5) is the first body segment, which is directly above since y=5 to y=4, so moving down from (4,5) to (4,4).\n\nThen next segment (3,5), which is left of (4,5), so the snake was moving left or something. Let's trace the snake.\n\nPositions in order: head (4,4), then (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2)\n\nSo the tail is at (5,2).\n\nNow, from (4,4) to (4,5): that's moving up? No: from (4,5) to (4,4) is down, so the head moved down to (4,4).\n\nThen from (4,5) to (3,5): that's moving left, from (4,5) to (3,5).\n\nThen (3,5) to (2,5): left.\n\n(2,5) to (1,5): left.\n\n(1,5) to (1,4): down.\n\n(1,4) to (1,3): down.\n\n(1,3) to (1,2): down.\n\n(1,2) to (1,1): down.\n\n(1,1) to (2,1): right.\n\n(2,1) to (3,1): right.\n\n(3,1) to (4,1): right.\n\n(4,1) to (5,1): right.\n\n(5,1) to (6,1): right.\n\n(6,1) to (6,2): up.\n\n(6,2) to (5,2): left? (6,2) to (5,2) is left, but that's the tail end.\n\nThe snake body: segments are connected, so the direction changes.\n\nBut for movement, we care about the head and possible moves.\n\nCurrent head position: (4,4), moving down (since head direction is D).\n\nAvailable moves: since moving down, cannot move up instantly (no reverse), so cannot move U.\n\nPossible moves: D, L, R.\n\nBut need to check for walls, obstacles, and body collisions.\n\nFirst, walls: border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So we can only move to x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nNow, possible moves from (4,4):\n\n- Down (D): to (4,3)\n\n- Left (L): to (3,4)\n\n- Right (R): to (5,4)\n\nCannot move up (U) because reverse is not allowed, and also because current direction is down.\n\nNow, check if these cells are occupied or walls.\n\n(4,3): is it a wall? Walls are at borders and (4,6), so (4,3) is within bounds, not a wall.\n\n(3,4): similarly, x=3,y=4, between 1-6, not a wall.\n\n(5,4): same.\n\nNow, check if occupied by snake body.\n\nSnake positions: [(4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2)]\n\nSo cells occupied: (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2)\n\n(4,3) is not in this list, so free.\n\n(3,4) not in list, free.\n\n(5,4) not in list, free.\n\nBut (1,4) is occupied, but that's not adjacent to head; head is at (4,4), so adjacent are (4,3), (3,4), (5,4), (4,5) but (4,5) is body, so moving to (4,5) would be body collision, but we cannot move up anyway because of direction.\n\nMoving to (4,5) is up, which is reverse, not allowed, and it's occupied.\n\nFor (4,3): down, to (4,3)\n\n(3,4): left, to (3,4)\n\n(5,4): right, to (5,4)\n\nAll seem free.\n\nBut there is food at (4,3) and (3,2).\n\n(4,3) has food with value +1, life span 2.\n\nIf I move down to (4,3), I eat the food, since head moves onto it.\n\nBut I need to check if it's safe.\n\nFirst, eating food: positive food, so snake length increases by one, so when I eat, the tail doesn't move for that turn, so snake grows.\n\nBut also, there is a danger: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nWhere is the tail? Tail is at (5,2).\n\nHead is at (4,4), tail at (5,2), distance: dx=1, dy=2, not adjacent. Adjacent would be same x or y, diff 1, or diagonal? But movement is orthogonal, so adjacent means sharing an edge, so (4,4) and (5,2) are not adjacent; (4,4) neighbors are (4,3), (4,5), (3,4), (5,4).\n\nTail is at (5,2), which is not adjacent to head, so no issue.\n\nTherefore, moving to (4,3) should be safe and I eat the food.\n\nBut I need to think ahead 5+ turns for long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's list the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid: 6x6, x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\nWalls: borders, so cells outside 1-6 are walls, and internal (4,6) is obstacle.\n\n(4,6) is at row 6, column 4? x=4,y=6.\n\ny=6 is top row, since y=7 is wall.\n\ny from 1 to 6, y=1 bottom, y=6 top.\n\nx=1 left, x=6 right.\n\nSo obstacle at (4,6), which is top row, column 4.\n\nNow, snake: head at (4,4), which is center-ish.\n\nFood:\n\n- (4,3): value 1, life span 2, so must be eaten by turn 67.\n\n- (3,2): value 1, life span 8, so can be eaten later.\n\nIf I move down to (4,3), I eat the food immediately.\n\nThen snake grows: new head at (4,3), body: the previous head (4,4) becomes body, so positions: new head (4,3), then (4,4), (4,5), etc., and tail stays at (5,2) for this turn since we ate, so tail doesn't move.\n\nWhen you eat, the tail doesn't move, so snake length increases by one.\n\nSo after eating at (4,3), positions: head to (4,3), then previous segments: (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), ..., up to (5,2), and since we ate, tail remains, so the segment before tail is added, so positions: [(4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2)] but now length 17? Original positions had 16 segments? Let's count.\n\nOriginal: 16 positions: index 0 to 15, 16 segments.\n\nAfter eating, head moves to (4,3), and the tail doesn't move, so we add a new segment at the head, and tail stays, so positions become: new head (4,3), then old head (4,4), then (4,5), (3,5), ..., up to (5,2), and since tail didn't move, (5,2) is still there, so now 17 segments.\n\nThe segment that was tail remains, and a new segment is added at head.\n\nIn terms of list: we add the new position to the front, and remove the last one only if no food eaten. If food eaten, we add new head position to front, and do not remove the tail, so list length increases by one.\n\nHere, if I eat at (4,3), new positions: [ (4,3) ] + previous positions [ (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2) ] so 17 positions.\n\nTail is still (5,2).\n\nNow, direction: after moving down, head direction is D.\n\nNow, life span of food at (4,3) was 2, after eaten, it's gone.\n\nOther food at (3,2) with life span 8.\n\nBut I need to think about future moves.\n\nIf I don't eat now, I might miss this food since life span is short.\n\nLife span 2, turn 66, so if not eaten now, on turn 67 it might be available, but only if I can reach it.\n\nBut let's consider options.\n\nPossible actions at turn 66: D, L, R.\n\nD: to (4,3), eat food, grow.\n\nL: to (3,4)\n\nR: to (5,4)\n\nIf I go L to (3,4), or R to (5,4), I don't eat, and the food at (4,3) might disappear soon.\n\nOn turn 67, if I didn't eat, food at (4,3) life span decreases to 1, so still available on turn 67, but only if I can move to it.\n\nBut let's think ahead.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid dead ends or traps.\n\nFirst, let's see the map.\n\nSnake body occupies many cells, especially the left and bottom.\n\nList all occupied cells:\n\n(4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2)\n\nSo, rows y=1: (1,1),(2,1),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1) — all occupied except possibly (3,1) to (6,1) are occupied, (1,1) to (6,1) all? (1,1),(2,1),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1) yes, all of y=1 row occupied.\n\ny=2: (1,2), (6,2), (5,2) — so (1,2) and (5,2),(6,2)\n\n(5,2) and (6,2) occupied, and (1,2)\n\nBut (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) are free? (3,2) has food, but not occupied by snake.\n\ny=3: (1,3) occupied, (4,3) has food, not occupied.\n\nOther points free.\n\ny=4: head (4,4), and (1,4) occupied, so (2,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4) free? (3,4) and (5,4) are possible moves.\n\ny=5: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5) occupied, so (5,5), (6,5) free.\n\ny=6: only obstacle at (4,6), so (1,6),(2,6),(3,6),(5,6),(6,6) free, but (4,6) obstacle.\n\nNow, if I move down to (4,3) on turn 66, I eat and grow.\n\nThen on turn 67, head at (4,3), direction D (since moved down).\n\nFrom (4,3), possible moves: D to (4,2), L to (3,3), R to (5,3)\n\nCannot move U because reverse from down.\n\nNow, (4,2): is it free? Snake positions after eating: head (4,3), body (4,4), (4,5), etc., tail (5,2).\n\n(4,2) not occupied, no wall.\n\n(3,3): not occupied.\n\n(5,3): not occupied.\n\nFood at (3,2), which is adjacent.\n\nIf I move to (4,2), that's down, then from there I can go to (3,2) or other.\n\n(3,2) has food, I could eat it later.\n\nBut let's see if moving to (4,3) now is good.\n\nIf I don't move to (4,3) now, say I go left to (3,4) on turn 66.\n\nThen turn 66: move L to (3,4)\n\nHead at (3,4), direction L (since moved left).\n\nThen on turn 67, possible moves: from (3,4), can move U, D, L, but not R (reverse).\n\nU to (3,5), but (3,5) is body? Snake positions after move: head to (3,4), then body: (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), etc.\n\nAfter moving to (3,4), positions: new head (3,4), then (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), and tail (5,2) but since no food eaten, tail moves? When no food eaten, the tail moves forward.\n\nOn move to (3,4), no food at (3,4), so we move head to (3,4), and tail moves: the last segment (5,2) is removed, and the new tail is the second last, which was (6,2)? Positions: after moving, head is (3,4), then (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), ..., up to (6,2), and (5,2) is removed.\n\nOriginal positions: index 0: (4,4), 1: (4,5), 2: (3,5), 3: (2,5), 4: (1,5), 5: (1,4), 6: (1,3), 7: (1,2), 8: (1,1), 9: (2,1), 10: (3,1), 11: (4,1), 12: (5,1), 13: (6,1), 14: (6,2), 15: (5,2)  // 16 segments\n\nAfter moving to (3,4) without eating: new head (3,4), then the previous head and body: (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), and tail (5,2) is removed, so positions: [(3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)]  // 16 segments, tail at (6,2)\n\n(6,2) was previously the 14th segment, now tail.\n\nSimilarly, if I move right to (5,4), similar.\n\nBut back to turn 66 choices.\n\nIf I move down to (4,3) and eat, I grow, and have more body, which might make it harder to maneuver, but I get score.\n\nIf I don't eat, I can move to (3,4) or (5,4), and then on turn 67 I might go to (4,3) if possible.\n\nBut food at (4,3) has life span 2, so on turn 67, if not eaten on 66, it will have life span 1, so available on turn 67.\n\nIf I move to (3,4) on turn 66, then on turn 67, from (3,4), I can move down to (3,3), or left to (2,4), or up to (3,5), but (3,5) is body.\n\nFrom (3,4), moves: U to (3,5): occupied by body, since in positions (3,5) is there.\n\nD to (3,3): free? (3,3) not occupied.\n\nL to (2,4): free? (2,4) not occupied.\n\nR to (4,4): but (4,4) is body now, occupied, and also reverse if I was moving left? Direction: after moving L to (3,4), direction is L, so moving right to (4,4) would be reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo possible from (3,4): U, D, L, but U to (3,5) occupied, so only D to (3,3) or L to (2,4).\n\nSimilarly, if I had moved right to (5,4) on turn 66, similar situation.\n\nBut let's consider the food at (4,3) is only available for two turns, including this one.\n\nIf I don't eat it now, and I go to (3,4), then on turn 67, from (3,4), I can move D to (3,3), or L to (2,4), but not to (4,3) directly because to go to (4,3) from (3,4), I need to move right, which is reverse, not allowed.\n\nFrom (3,4), moving to (4,3) is not adjacent; adjacent are (3,5), (3,3), (2,4), (4,4).\n\n(4,3) is diagonal, not adjacent, so I cannot move directly.\n\nTo reach (4,3) from (3,4), I need to go via (4,4) or (3,3), but (4,4) is occupied and reverse move.\n\nSo from (3,4), I cannot reach (4,3) on turn 67.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (5,4) on turn 66, from (5,4) on turn 67, I can move U, D, L, but not R (reverse if moved right).\n\nU to (5,5), D to (5,3), L to (4,4) which is body, R not allowed.\n\n(5,3) might be free.\n\nBut to reach (4,3) from (5,4), not directly, only via (5,3) or (4,4), but (4,4) occupied.\n\nSo if I don't eat the food at (4,3) on turn 66, it might be impossible to eat it on turn 67 because the snake body is in the way.\n\nOn turn 67, food at (4,3) still there, life span 1.\n\nBut who can reach it? Only the head if it moves to it.\n\nBut if head is at (3,4) or (5,4) after turn 66, it cannot move to (4,3) directly on turn 67 because not adjacent or blocked.\n\nIf head is at (4,4) on turn 66, but on turn 66 head moves away.\n\nAfter turn 66, if I moved to (3,4), head at (3,4), (4,3) is empty but with food.\n\nOn turn 67, to eat (4,3), the head must move to it, but from (3,4), I can only go to (3,3) or (2,4) or (3,5) but (3,5) occupied, so not to (4,3).\n\nSimilarly from (5,4), I can go to (5,3) or (5,5) or (6,4), not to (4,3).\n\nAnd (4,4) is occupied by body.\n\nSo indeed, if I don't eat the food on turn 66, I cannot eat it on turn 67, and it disappears on turn 68.\n\nSo I should eat it now to get the point.\n\nMoreover, it's positive food, so I should take it when I can.\n\nNow, about the other food at (3,2), I can eat it later.\n\nBut let's think about long-term.\n\nIf I eat at (4,3) now, head at (4,3), direction D.\n\nThen on turn 67, from (4,3), I can move D to (4,2), L to (3,3), or R to (5,3).\n\nNow, (4,2) is free, (3,3) free, (5,3) free.\n\n(3,2) has food, which is below (3,3).\n\nIf I move to (4,2) on turn 67, then I can go to (3,2) or (5,2) or (4,1), but (4,1) is body? Let's see positions.\n\nAfter eating on turn 66: positions: [(4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2)]  // 17 segments\n\nTail at (5,2).\n\nOn turn 67, from (4,3), move say to (4,2): no food there, so move head to (4,2), tail moves: remove (5,2), new tail (6,2)? Positions: after move, head to (4,2), then (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), ..., up to (6,2), and (5,2) removed, so tail at (6,2).\n\n(4,2) is free, so ok.\n\nThen from (4,2), I can move to (3,2) to eat food, or to (5,2), or to (4,1), but (4,1) is body? After move to (4,2), positions: [(4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)] tail at (6,2)\n\n(4,1) is occupied, (6,2) occupied, but (3,2) and (5,2) are free? (5,2) was tail but removed, so free.\n\n(3,2) has food.\n\nSo from (4,2), I can move L to (3,2) to eat, or R to (5,2), or D to (4,1) but (4,1) occupied, cannot move there.\n\nU to (4,3) but reverse if direction is D? After moving to (4,2) from (4,3), direction is D, so moving up would be reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo from (4,2), moves: D to (4,1) but occupied, L to (3,2), R to (5,2)\n\n(4,1) occupied, so only L or R.\n\nIf I go L to (3,2), eat food.\n\nOr R to (5,2).\n\n(5,2) is free.\n\nBut if I eat at (3,2), I grow again.\n\nBut I need to think if that's safe.\n\nFirst, on turn 67, after moving to (4,2), I might go to (3,2).\n\nBut let's plan a path.\n\nSince I have to think 5 turns ahead, I should consider sequences.\n\nTurn 66: move D to (4,3), eat, grow. Head now at (4,3), direction D.\n\nTurn 67: from (4,3), I have choices: D to (4,2), L to (3,3), R to (5,3)\n\nIf I go to (4,2), then as above, from (4,2) I can go to (3,2) or (5,2).\n\n(3,2) has food, so I should eat it.\n\nBut life span 8, plenty of time, but why not eat when possible.\n\nBut let's see the area.\n\nIf I go to (3,3) on turn 67, from (4,3) move L to (3,3).\n\nThen no food at (3,3), so move head to (3,3), tail moves: positions after move: head (3,3), then (4,3), (4,4), etc., remove tail (5,2), so tail at (6,2) or whatever.\n\nThen from (3,3), I can move to (3,2) to eat, or other.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut to maximize, eating (4,3) now is good.\n\nBut there is a potential issue: after eating at (4,3), the snake is longer, and the body is around.\n\nAnother thing: Tail Reward Danger, but not applicable here.\n\nAlso, the food at (3,2) can be eaten later.\n\nBut let's consider not eating now to avoid growing and having more body.\n\nBut that might not be wise, since food is positive and available.\n\nMoreover, the grid has few free cells.\n\nList free cells:\n\nx=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 except walls and obstacles.\n\nObstacle: (4,6) wall.\n\nSnake occupies: (1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(1,5),(2,1),(2,5),(3,1),(3,5),(4,1),(4,3) if I eat, but not yet, (4,4),(4,5),(5,1),(5,2),(6,1),(6,2)\n\nAnd (3,1) etc.\n\nFree cells: let's list all cells not occupied and not wall.\n\ny=1: all occupied: (1,1) to (6,1)\n\ny=2: occupied: (1,2), (5,2), (6,2) — so free: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) but (3,2) has food, so free for movement except food.\n\n(3,2) is free cell with food.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2), (4,2) free.\n\ny=3: occupied: (1,3) — so free: (2,3), (3,3), (4,3) has food, (5,3), (6,3)\n\n(4,3) has food, but cell is free until occupied.\n\ny=4: occupied: (1,4), (4,4) — head, but after move, etc. Currently on turn 66, (4,4) occupied, (1,4) occupied.\n\nFree: (2,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4)\n\ny=5: occupied: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) — so free: (5,5), (6,5)\n\ny=6: obstacle at (4,6), so free: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (5,6), (6,6)\n\nAlso, internal obstacle (4,6).\n\nSo free cells: (2,2), (3,2)F, (4,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3)F, (5,3), (6,3), (2,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4), (5,5), (6,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (5,6), (6,6) — 19 cells, but snake has 16 segments, after eating 17, so less free space.\n\nWith 16 segments, 36 cells total, minus walls: grid 6x6=36 cells, minus obstacle (4,6), so 35 cells, snake 16, so 19 free, as above.\n\nAfter eating at (4,3), snake 17, free 18 cells? 35-17=18, but (4,3) eaten, so one free cell less, but food is there, so when eaten, cell is occupied.\n\nInitially, cells: 35 available (including food cells), snake 16, so 19 free cells including two food.\n\nAfter eating one food, snake 17, one food left, so 35-17=18 cells minus one food? Total cells: 36 -1 obstacle =35.\n\nSnake occupies 16, food occupies 2 cells but not by snake, so for movement, free cells are 35 - 16 - 2? No: the food cells are part of the grid, not occupied by snake, so can be moved to.\n\nBut when you move to food, you eat it.\n\nNumber of free cells: total cells minus walls minus snake minus obstacles, but obstacles are walls.\n\nWalls are not part of grid, so playable cells: x1-6,y1-6 except (4,6), so 36-1=35 cells.\n\nSnake occupies 16 cells, so 35-16=19 cells free, including the two food cells.\n\nAfter eating one food, say at (4,3), snake now occupies 17 cells, and one food left at (3,2), so free cells: 35-17=18, but the food cell (3,2) is still there, not occupied, so 18 free cells including the food.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, back to decision.\n\nI think eating at (4,3) on turn 66 is beneficial and safe.\n\nThen on turn 67, from (4,3), I can go to (4,2) to position to eat (3,2).\n\nIf I go to (4,2) on turn 67, then on turn 68, from (4,2), I can go L to (3,2) to eat.\n\nBut (3,2) has food, so eat on turn 68.\n\nBut life span is 8, so plenty of time.\n\nI could go directly, but from (4,3) to (3,2) is not adjacent, so I need to move to (3,3) or (4,2) first.\n\nIf on turn 67 I move L to (3,3), then from (3,3) I can move down to (3,2) to eat.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let's see if there are risks.\n\nAnother thing: the tail is at (5,2), and when I move, it moves.\n\nBut no immediate danger.\n\nNow, what about moving to (3,4) or (5,4) on turn 66.\n\nIf I move to (3,4) on turn 66, no eat.\n\nThen head at (3,4), direction L.\n\nThen turn 67, as before, I can move to (3,3) or (2,4).\n\n(3,3) is free, (2,4) free.\n\nIf I go to (3,3), then from there I can go to (3,2) to eat on turn 68 or something.\n\nBut I missed the food at (4,3), which is +1 point.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (5,4), I might go down to (5,3) etc, but still miss (4,3).\n\nSo better to eat (4,3) now.\n\nMoreover, with the short life span, I should not miss it.\n\nSo for turn 66, move down to (4,3).\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the question is to think 5+ turns ahead, but output actions starting from turn 66.\n\nThe answer format is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but I need to plan a sequence.\n\nBut I don't have to output all, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan for several turns.\n\nPerhaps for now, I can decide turn 66 action, and outline the next.\n\nBut let's plan a path.\n\nTurn 66: move D to (4,3), eat food, head at (4,3), direction D.\n\nTurn 67: from (4,3), I need to move to position for (3,2).\n\nI can move D to (4,2), or L to (3,3), or R to (5,3).\n\nIf I move to (4,2), then turn 68, from (4,2), I can move L to (3,2) to eat, since (3,2) is left.\n\nDirection: after moving down to (4,2), direction D.\n\nThen from (4,2), move L to (3,2), which is left, not reverse, so ok.\n\nThen eat at (3,2).\n\nIf I move to (3,3) on turn 67, from (4,3) move L to (3,3), direction L.\n\nThen from (3,3), move D to (3,2) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, both fine.\n\nBut moving to (4,2) might be better because (3,2) is directly adjacent from there.\n\nFrom (4,2) to (3,2) is left, orthogonal.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, after eating both, the snake is longer, and I need to find a path to survive.\n\nBut there are free cells above: y=5 and y=6.\n\nFor example, after eating (3,2), head at (3,2), then I can move to free areas.\n\nBut let's simulate.\n\nFirst, turn 66: move D to (4,3), eat. Snake grows to 17 segments, head at (4,3), dir D.\n\nPositions: [(4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2)]\n\nTail at (5,2).\n\nTurn 67: move to (4,2). No food at (4,2), so move head to (4,2), tail moves: remove (5,2), new tail (6,2)? Positions: head (4,2), then (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)  // 17 segments? After adding head and removing tail, still 17, but tail is now (6,2).\n\n(5,2) removed, so (4,2) added, (5,2) removed, so segments: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), ..., (6,1), (6,2) — yes, tail (6,2).\n\nDirection: moved down to (4,2), so dir D.\n\nTurn 68: from (4,2), move L to (3,2). (3,2) has food, value +1, so eat. Grow.\n\nMove head to (3,2), tail does not move.\n\nPositions: new head (3,2), then (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) and since ate, tail (6,2) remains, so add (3,2) at front, no remove, so 18 segments: [(3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)]\n\nTail at (6,2).\n\nDirection: moved left, so dir L.\n\nNow, head at (3,2), direction L.\n\nNow, free cells: after eating, snake occupies more, free cells include (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2) occupied now, (5,2) free? (5,2) was tail but removed earlier, now free.\n\n(5,3), (5,4), (6,3), (6,4), (5,5), (6,5), and top row (1,6),(2,6),(3,6),(5,6),(6,6)\n\n(3,3) is free, etc.\n\nFrom (3,2), direction L, so cannot move R (reverse).\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,3), D to (3,1), L to (2,2), R not allowed.\n\n(3,1) is occupied, part of body.\n\n(2,2) free, (3,3) free.\n\nSo can move U to (3,3) or L to (2,2).\n\nSay, move to (3,3) on turn 69.\n\nNo food, so move head to (3,3), tail moves: remove tail (6,2), new tail (6,1)? Positions: head (3,3), then (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), etc., remove (6,2), so tail at (6,1).\n\nAfter move: [(3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)]  // 18 segments? After adding head and removing tail, still 18, tail now (6,1).\n\n(6,1) was there.\n\nThen from (3,3), direction U (since moved up from (3,2) to (3,3)? From (3,2) to (3,3) is up, y from 2 to 3, so U.\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen turn 70: from (3,3), moves: U to (3,4), D to (3,2), L to (2,3), R to (4,3) but (4,3) is body, occupied.\n\nD to (3,2) is reverse, not allowed since direction U.\n\nSo possible: U to (3,4), L to (2,3), R not possible (occupied or not, but (4,3) occupied).\n\n(3,4) free? Yes, (3,4) free.\n\n(2,3) free.\n\nSo can go to (3,4) or (2,3).\n\nSay, go to (3,4) on turn 70.\n\nThen continue to free areas.\n\nBut this seems fine.\n\nIf on turn 67 from (4,3), I had gone to (3,3) directly.\n\nBut similar.\n\nNow, to avoid growing too much, but since food is positive, eating is good for score.\n\nAnd I need to maximize score.\n\nBut with more length, it might be harder to move, but in this case, there are free cells above.\n\nAfter turn 70, head at (3,4), I can go to (2,4) or (3,5) but (3,5) occupied, etc., to (2,4) or up to (3,5) occupied, so to (2,4) or (3,4) to (4,4) but occupied.\n\nFrom (3,4), U to (3,5) occupied, so only L to (2,4) or D to (3,3) but reverse not allowed.\n\nDirection after moving to (3,4): from (3,3) to (3,4) is up, so dir U.\n\nThen from (3,4), U to (3,5) occupied, D to (3,3) reverse not allowed, L to (2,4) free, R to (4,4) occupied.\n\nSo only L to (2,4).\n\nThen go to (2,4), and so on.\n\nEventually, I can go to the top row where there are free cells.\n\nFor example, from (2,4), I can go to (2,5) but occupied, or (2,3), or (1,4) occupied, etc.\n\nBut I can find a path.\n\nSince I need to output actions for turn 66 and possibly next, but the format is to output for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but I think for now, I can output turn 66 action.\n\nBut the instruction says to output multiple turns: \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nBut it doesn't specify how many, but since I need to think ahead, I should provide a sequence for a few turns.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns or so.\n\nCurrent turn t1=66.\n\nLet me plan:\n\nTurn 66: move D to (4,3) // eat food\n\nThen turn 67: from (4,3), move to (4,2) // to approach (3,2)\n\nTurn 68: from (4,2), move L to (3,2) // eat food at (3,2)\n\nThen turn 69: from (3,2), move U to (3,3)\n\nTurn 70: from (3,3), move U to (3,4) // since (3,4) free\n\nThen turn 71: from (3,4), move L to (2,4)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nOn turn 69, from (3,2) after eating, head at (3,2), dir L? After moving to (3,2) on turn 68, direction is L (since left from (4,2)).\n\nThen turn 69: from (3,2), move U to (3,3), which is not reverse, so dir U.\n\nThen turn 70: from (3,3), move U to (3,4), dir U.\n\nThen turn 71: from (3,4), move L to (2,4), dir L.\n\nNow, (2,4) is free, no problem.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (2,5) but occupied, or (2,3), or (1,4) occupied, so to (2,3) or (3,4) but occupied, etc.\n\nBut (2,3) is free.\n\nThen to (2,2) or (1,3) occupied, etc.\n\nBut I can survive.\n\nIf I don't eat the second food immediately, but it has long life, so I can eat it later, but since it's there, might as well eat.\n\nIn the sequence above, I eat both foods quickly.\n\nAnother option: after turn 66, on turn 67, from (4,3) go to (3,3) directly, then turn 68 to (3,2) eat.\n\nSimilar.\n\nBut with (4,2) step, it might be fine.\n\nNow, for the output, I need to box the actions.\n\nBut first, on turn 66, action is D.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I need to specify based on the state.\n\nBut since I'm to output a sequence, I should provide for, say, 5 turns.\n\nCurrent turn 66 to 70 or 71.\n\nt1=66, so turns 66,67,68,69,70.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 66: D\n\nTurn 67: D // to (4,2)\n\nTurn 68: L // to (3,2) and eat\n\nBut on turn 67, when I move to (4,2), no food, so tail moves.\n\nThen on turn 68, move to (3,2) eat.\n\nThen turn 69: from (3,2), I need to move, say U to (3,3)\n\nTurn 70: from (3,3), U to (3,4)\n\nIn turn 70, from (3,3) to (3,4) is U.\n\nBut in my earlier, I have it.\n\nTo avoid potential issues, but I think it's ok.\n\nPerhaps I should not eat the second food so fast to keep more space, but since it's positive, eating is good.\n\nAnd with life span 8, I have time, but no reason to delay.\n\nMoreover, if I delay, the snake body might block, but in this case, the tail is moving, so some space frees up.\n\nFor example, if I don't eat on turn 68, but go elsewhere, I can come back, but it might be riskier.\n\nBut I think the sequence is fine.\n\nSo for answer:\n\nTurn 66: D (down)\n\nTurn 67: D (down) to (4,2)\n\nTurn 68: L (left) to (3,2) eat\n\nTurn 69: U (up) to (3,3)\n\nTurn 70: U (up) to (3,4)\n\nAfter that, I can continue.\n\nBut in the output, I need to specify the actions.\n\nNow, for turn 67, moving to (4,2) is down, which is consistent with direction.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAnother thing: on turn 67, from (4,3), I could move to (3,3) instead.\n\nBut to (4,2) is fine.\n\nTo make it shorter path to food, but similar.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n\nSo for the boxed answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, the AI must think 5+ turns ahead. The current state (turn 66) involves a snake with head at (4,4) moving downward, and two positive food items: one at (4,3) with a short life span of 2 (must be eaten by turn 67), and one at (3,2) with a longer life span of 8. The grid has walls at the borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and an internal obstacle at (4,6), limiting movement to x=1-6 and y=1-6.\n\n### Key Considerations for the Plan:\n- **Immediate Opportunity**: The food at (4,3) has a short life span and must be eaten on turn 66 or 67 to avoid losing the +1 score. Moving down (D) on turn 66 eats this food safely, as the head is not adjacent to the tail (at (5,2)), avoiding Tail Reward Danger.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: After eating, the snake grows, reducing free space. The food at (3,2) should be eaten soon for additional score, but its life span allows flexibility. The plan prioritizes eating both foods while navigating toward open areas (e.g., top-right) to avoid dead ends.\n- **Collision Avoidance**: The snake must avoid walls, the obstacle at (4,6), and its own body. Movements are planned to steer clear of the densely occupied bottom-left area.\n- **Movement Constraints**: The snake cannot reverse direction instantly. From turn 66 (direction D), moves to U are invalid on turn 67. Subsequent directions are updated based on each move.\n\n### 5-Turn Plan (Turns 66-70):\n1. **Turn 66 (current)**: Move down (D) to (4,3) to eat the positive food (+1 score, snake length increases). This is optimal due to the food's short life span; missing it now makes it inaccessible on turn 67 because the body blocks direct paths from alternative positions like (3,4) or (5,4).\n2. **Turn 67**: Move down (D) to (4,2). This positions the head to eat the food at (3,2) on the next turn. Moving down is safe (no collision) and maintains momentum toward the second food.\n3. **Turn 68**: Move left (L) to (3,2) to eat the second positive food (+1 score, snake length increases). This is efficient, as (3,2) is directly adjacent from (4,2) and eating now secures the score.\n4. **Turn 69**: Move up (U) to (3,3). This avoids the crowded bottom rows and heads toward open space near the top (y=5-6). No food here, so the tail moves normally.\n5. **Turn 70**: Move up (U) to (3,4). This continues the path upward, away from the body-filled area. (3,4) is free, and moving up is valid after the previous upward move.\n\n### Why This Sequence?\n- **Score Maximization**: Eats both available foods quickly, adding +2 score and increasing length by 2.\n- **Survival Focus**: After turn 70, the head is at (3,4) with open paths to free cells like (2,4), (3,5) (if cleared), or (4,4) (when vacated). The sequence avoids risks:\n  - No body collisions: All target cells are free at the time of movement.\n  - No wall/obstacle issues: Movements stay within bounds and avoid (4,6).\n  - Tail Reward Danger is irrelevant as head and tail are never adjacent during eating.\n- **Life Span Utilization**: The food at (4,3) is eaten before expiration; (3,2) is eaten with turns to spare.\n- **Future Flexibility**: Post-turn 70, the snake can navigate to less congested areas (e.g., via (2,4) to (2,5) or (2,6) as the tail moves), ensuring long-term survival.\n\n### Full Answer Format:\n\\boxed{\nTurn 66: D (down)  \nTurn 67: D (down)  \nTurn 68: L (left)  \nTurn 69: U (up)  \nTurn 70: U (up)  \n}",

        "step": 67,
        "score": 17,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 67. The grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7), and walls are on the borders. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: The head is at (4,3), and the body segments follow: (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2). That's 17 segments, so the snake length is 17.\n\nThe head direction is down, which is D, meaning moving in the negative y-direction. Since down is (x,y-1), from (4,3), moving down would go to (4,2), but I need to check if that's valid.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (3,2) with value 1 and life span 7\n\n- (5,3) with value 1 and life span 10\n\nBoth are positive food since value is +1.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score and ensure survival.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls on borders, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also, internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (4,3)\n\nThen: (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2)\n\nSo the tail is at (5,2).\n\nCurrent head direction is D (down), so from (4,3), moving down would be to (4,2).\n\nBut is (4,2) safe? Let's see what's there.\n\nFirst, check for collisions: walls or body.\n\n(4,2): x=4, y=2. Not on border, so not a wall. Is it occupied by body? Look at snake positions: (4,3) is head, (4,4), (4,5) are above, then (3,5), etc. (4,2) is not in the list, so it should be empty. Similarly, (5,2) is the tail, but that's different cell.\n\nSnake positions: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2). So (4,2) is not listed, so it's free.\n\nNow, food: there's food at (3,2) and (5,3).\n\n(3,2) is to the left of head, and (5,3) is to the right.\n\nHead is at (4,3), so (3,2) is left and down? x=3,y=2 vs head x=4,y=3, so (3,2) is one left and one down? Let's see relative positions.\n\nFrom (4,3):\n\n- Left: (3,3)\n\n- Right: (5,3)\n\n- Up: (4,4) but that's body\n\n- Down: (4,2)\n\n(3,2) is not adjacent directly; it's diagonal? (3,2) is adjacent? Cells adjacent if they share a side, so up, down, left, right.\n\nFrom (4,3):\n\n- Up: (4,4) - occupied by body\n\n- Down: (4,2) - empty\n\n- Left: (3,3) - is this occupied? Snake positions: (1,3) is there, but (3,3)? List: positions are (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), etc. No (3,3) mentioned, so (3,3) should be empty.\n\nSimilarly, right: (5,3) - food is there? Food at (5,3), but (5,3) is a position, and it has food, so it's occupied by food, not body.\n\n(5,3) is food position, so it's not body, but when head moves there, it eats food.\n\nNow, possible moves from current position (4,3) with direction D.\n\nSince head direction is D, and no instant reverse, so cannot move up (opposite of down).\n\nSo possible moves: left, right, down? Directions: U, D, L, R.\n\nCurrent direction D, so cannot move U (up) because that's reverse.\n\nCan move L (left), R (right), or D (down).\n\nNow, D: to (4,2)\n\nL: to (3,3)\n\nR: to (5,3)\n\nNow, check each:\n\n- Move D to (4,2): is it safe? (4,2) not wall, not body, so safe. Also, no food there, so just move, no eat.\n\n- Move L to (3,3): (3,3) not wall, not body (as per list), so safe. No food, so just move.\n\n- Move R to (5,3): (5,3) has food, so if move there, eat food. Value +1, snake length increases.\n\nBut need to check if it's safe. (5,3) not wall, not body? Body positions: head (4,3), then (4,4), etc., (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2). No (5,3), so not body. Food is there, so moving there eats it.\n\nBut after eating, snake grows, so new segment added.\n\nNow, also, there's a risk: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills.\n\nBut here, tail is at (5,2), which is adjacent to head? Head at (4,3), tail at (5,2).\n\nAre they adjacent? (4,3) and (5,2): difference in x is 1, y is 1, so diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent means same x or y, diff by 1 in one coordinate.\n\nSo (4,3) and (5,2): |dx|=1, |dy|=1, so not adjacent; they don't share a side. Adjacent cells would be like (4,3) and (4,2), (4,4), (3,3), (5,3). (5,2) is not adjacent to (4,3); it's diagonal.\n\nSo no issue. Eating at (5,3) should be fine.\n\nBut (5,3) is the food position, and head moving to it.\n\nNow, tail is at (5,2), which is below (5,3)? (5,2) is south of (5,3).\n\nBut when head eats at (5,3), snake grows, so new tail position depends on movement.\n\nI need to think about future moves.\n\nAlso, there's food at (3,2) which might be a target.\n\nBut let's think strategically. The snake is long, 17 segments, and the grid has obstacles.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid mentally.\n\nGrid 8x8, walls on borders.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), so that cell is blocked.\n\nSnake: head (4,3), going down? Direction D.\n\nBody: from head down to (4,4)? Head is (4,3), then (4,4) is above? Positions: [(4,3), (4,4), (4,5), ...] so if head is (4,3), and next is (4,4), that means the snake was moving up before, since from (4,4) to (4,3) is down? Let's see the path.\n\nList of positions: index 0: head (4,3)\n\nIndex 1: (4,4)  // so from head to segment 1 is from (4,3) to (4,4), which is up? But current direction is D, down. Inconsistency?\n\nSnake positions are given in order: head first, then body segments. So the head is at (4,3), the next segment is at (4,4), which means the snake moved from (4,4) to (4,3) at some point? But current head direction is D, down.\n\nPerhaps the direction is the last movement direction.\n\nGiven: \"Snake Head Direction: D\" , and positions: head (4,3), then (4,4), (4,5), etc.\n\n(4,4) is above (4,3), so if head was at (4,4) and moved down to (4,3), that makes sense with direction D.\n\nSimilarly, from (4,5) to (4,4) would be down, but (4,5) is before (4,4) in the list? Positions: index 0: (4,3) head, index 1: (4,4), index 2: (4,5), index 3: (3,5), etc.\n\nSo the movement: from index 2 (4,5) to index 1 (4,4) is down? From (4,5) to (4,4) is down, then from (4,4) to (4,3) is down? But (4,3) to (4,4) would be up if moving to next segment, but the positions are in order from head to tail, so the tail is last.\n\nStandard: positions list: [head, segment after head, ..., tail]\n\nSo the head is at position i, the next segment is at position i+1, which is where the head was previous turn.\n\nSimilarly, the tail is at the end.\n\nIn terms of movement: when snake moves, head goes to new cell, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nFor example, if head moves to a new cell, segment 1 moves to where head was, segment 2 to where segment 1 was, and so on, tail moves away from its position.\n\nCurrent state: head at (4,3), direction D, meaning it just moved down to (4,3) from (4,4) previous turn? Positions: head (4,3), then (4,4) is the first body segment, so yes, head was at (4,4) before moving down to (4,3).\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) was at (4,5) before, etc.\n\nNow, for movement options.\n\nPossible actions from (4,3) with direction D (down), so cannot move up (U).\n\nOptions: L (left to (3,3)), R (right to (5,3)), D (down to (4,2)).\n\nNow, (3,3) is empty, (5,3) has food, (4,2) is empty.\n\nIf I move R to (5,3), I eat the food, length increases to 18, and the new tail will be... when head moves to (5,3), the body: segment 1 moves to (4,3), which was head position, segment 2 to (4,4), and so on, tail (5,2) moves to where the second last segment was, which is (6,2)? Positions: after head move to (5,3), new positions: head (5,3), then body: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), ..., up to (6,1), (6,2)? Let's see the last segments.\n\nCurrent positions: [ (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2) ] 17 positions.\n\nAfter moving head to (5,3), the new body segments: the first body segment moves to old head position (4,3), so new position 1: (4,3)\n\nThen position 2 moves to old position 1: (4,4)\n\nPosition 3 to old 2: (4,5)\n\nPosition 4 to old 3: (3,5)\n\n...\n\nPosition 16 to old 15: (6,1) moves to where? Old positions: index 15 is (6,1), index 16 is (6,2)? Positions: index 0 head (4,3), index 1 (4,4), index 2 (4,5), index 3 (3,5), index 4 (2,5), index 5 (1,5), index 6 (1,4), index 7 (1,3), index 8 (1,2), index 9 (1,1), index 10 (2,1), index 11 (3,1), index 12 (4,1), index 13 (5,1), index 14 (6,1), index 15 (6,2), index 16 (5,2) tail.\n\nSo after head moves to new cell, say (5,3), the new list: head (5,3), then body: old index 0 becomes new body index 1: (4,3)\n\nOld index 1 becomes new body index 2: (4,4)\n\n...\n\nOld index 15 becomes new body index 16: (6,2)\n\nOld index 16 (tail) is discarded, but since we ate food, we add a new segment at the end, so new tail is at old tail position? No.\n\nWhen snake eats food, it grows, so the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added where the tail was.\n\nStandard snake: when head eats food, the tail stays, so length increases by one.\n\nSo after moving to (5,3) and eating food, new positions: head (5,3), then body: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), ..., up to (6,1), (6,2), and then the tail (5,2) remains, so new segment at (5,2), but (5,2) was the old tail position.\n\nOld positions: tail at (5,2)\n\nAfter move: head to (5,3), body segments shift: new body index 1: old head (4,3)\n\nNew body index 2: old body 1 (4,4)\n\n...\n\nNew body index 16: old body 15 (6,2)? Let's index properly.\n\nLet S be the list: S[0] = head (4,3), S[1] = (4,4), S[2] = (4,5), S[3] = (3,5), S[4] = (2,5), S[5] = (1,5), S[6] = (1,4), S[7] = (1,3), S[8] = (1,2), S[9] = (1,1), S[10] = (2,1), S[11] = (3,1), S[12] = (4,1), S[13] = (5,1), S[14] = (6,1), S[15] = (6,2), S[16] = (5,2) tail.\n\nAfter moving head to new position P:\n\nNew S[0] = P = (5,3)\n\nNew S[1] = old S[0] = (4,3)\n\nNew S[2] = old S[1] = (4,4)\n\nNew S[3] = old S[2] = (4,5)\n\n...\n\nNew S[16] = old S[15] = (6,2)\n\nAnd since we ate food, we add a new segment at the position of old tail, so new S[17] = old S[16] = (5,2)\n\nSo the tail is now at (5,2), but it was already there, and we have a new segment at (5,2), but in the list, S[17] is (5,2), and S[16] is (6,2), etc.\n\nThe new snake has positions: head (5,3), then (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), and tail (5,2).\n\nSo the tail is at (5,2), and the segment before is (6,2).\n\nNow, for the current move, if I don't eat food, the tail moves away.\n\nBut back to decision.\n\nI also need to consider the food life span. Food at (3,2) has life span 7, so it will disappear after 7 turns, including current turn? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 67, life span 7, so after 7 turns, at turn 74, it disappears? Let's see.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo at turn t when food is present, life_span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning on turn t+L it is gone? Or after L decreases, when L=0 it disappears.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at the current turn, before action, food has life_span L.\n\nAfter the turn, countdown decreases by 1, so after L decreases, it disappears.\n\nFor example, at turn 67, food has life_span 7. After turn 67, it decreases to 6, so it will disappear when life_span reaches 0, which is after 7 turns, at the start of turn 74 or something. But for planning, we can think that food at (3,2) will be gone in 7 turns, so we have until turn 73 to eat it? Let's clarify.\n\nSuppose at turn t, food has life_span N. After each turn, including turn t, the life_span decreases by 1. So after turn t, it becomes N-1, after turn t+1, N-2, ..., after turn t + (N-1), it becomes 1, then after turn t + N, it becomes 0 and disappears.\n\nSo it can be eaten on turns when life_span >0, and disappears after turn t + N, meaning it is not there on turn t + N +1.\n\nAt turn t + k, for k from 0 to N-1, life_span is N - k, and it can be eaten if head moves there.\n\nAt turn t + N, life_span becomes 0 after the turn, so it cannot be eaten on turn t + N? The countdown decreases after the turn, I think.\n\nThe state is given at the start of turn t1, before action.\n\nAfter action, the state updates.\n\nFor food, at the start of turn, it has life_span L. After the turn, life_span decreases by 1.\n\nSo it can be eaten during the turn if head moves to it.\n\nIf life_span was 1, after eating or after the turn, it decreases to 0 and disappears.\n\nIn this case, at turn 67, food at (3,2) has life_span 7, so it can be eaten from turn 67 to 73, and disappears at turn 74.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) has life_span 10, so from 67 to 76, disappears at 77.\n\nNow, back to current move.\n\nOptions:\n\n- Move D to (4,2): safe, no eat.\n\n- Move L to (3,3): safe, no eat.\n\n- Move R to (5,3): eat food, length +1.\n\nIf I move R, I eat the food at (5,3), which is good, score +1.\n\nBut then the snake is at (5,3), and I need to think about future moves.\n\nThere is also food at (3,2) which is closer.\n\n(3,2) is at (3,2), which is adjacent to (3,3) and (4,2), etc.\n\nFrom head (4,3), (3,2) is not adjacent; it's diagonal. So I need to move to an adjacent cell first.\n\nFor example, to reach (3,2), I can go left to (3,3), then down to (3,2), or down to (4,2), then left to (3,2), etc.\n\nSimilarly, for (5,3), it's directly adjacent right.\n\nBut let's think about the grid and obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), so that cell is blocked.\n\nAlso, walls on borders.\n\nNow, the snake body occupies many cells, so free space is limited.\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nY from 0 to 7, bottom to top or top to bottom? Usually y=0 bottom, but in coordinates, it might be arbitrary, but for movement, we use the given.\n\nIn positions, y=1,2,3,4,5,6; x=1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\nBorder walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so cells (0,y) and (7,y) for all y, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x are walls.\n\nAlso, internal (4,6) obstacle.\n\nNow snake positions:\n\nHead (4,3)\n\nBody: (4,4), (4,5)  // vertical up\n\nThen (3,5), (2,5), (1,5)  // left\n\nThen (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1)  // down\n\nThen (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)  // right\n\nThen (6,2)  // up\n\nThen (5,2)  // left, tail\n\nSo the snake is coiled around the left and bottom.\n\nFree cells: for example, (2,3), (2,4), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (5,2) is tail, (5,3) food, (5,4), (6,3), (6,4), etc., and right side (3,2) food, (2,2), (3,2) is food, (2,2) might be free, etc.\n\nList all free cells.\n\nBut it's time-consuming. Perhaps I can think of areas.\n\nFood at (3,2) and (5,3).\n\n(3,2) is near the bottom-left, (5,3) is near the head.\n\nSince (5,3) is adjacent, I can eat it now for immediate reward.\n\nBut I need to prioritize long-term survival.\n\nAlso, after eating, the snake is longer, which might make it harder to maneuver.\n\nCurrent length 17, grid 8x8, but with walls and obstacles, free cells: total cells 64, minus walls: border walls, but the grid has cells from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7) are walls, so inner grid is (1,1) to (6,6) for movement, I think? No.\n\nThe walls occupy the cells, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, so they are not traversable.\n\nAlso internal (4,6) obstacle.\n\nSo traversable cells are (x,y) with 1<=x<=6, 1<=y<=6, except (4,6) is blocked.\n\nSo total possible cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, 6x6=36 cells, minus (4,6), so 35 cells.\n\nSnake occupies 17 cells, so 18 free cells, including the two food cells.\n\nFood at (3,2) and (5,3) are both within 1-6.\n\n(3,2) is x=3,y=2, (5,3) x=5,y=3.\n\nFree cells: let's list not occupied by snake or walls or obstacle.\n\nWalls: all x=0,7 or y=0,7.\n\nObstacle: (4,6)\n\nSnake: positions as above.\n\nSo free cells: for y=1: (2,1) snake, (3,1) snake, (4,1) snake, (5,1) snake, (6,1) snake, (1,1) snake, so all y=1 occupied except possibly (3,1) etc, all occupied.\n\ny=1: x=1 to 6: (1,1) snake, (2,1) snake, (3,1) snake, (4,1) snake, (5,1) snake, (6,1) snake, all occupied.\n\ny=2: x=1: (1,2) snake, x=2: (2,2) ? not in snake, snake has (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), but (2,2) not listed, so free? Snake positions: (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), etc. No (2,2) or (3,2) but (3,2) is food, not body.\n\nBody positions: (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (3,1), etc. No (2,2), so (2,2) free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) food, (4,2) free, (5,2) tail, (6,2) snake.\n\n(6,2) is snake position.\n\ny=2: x=1: (1,2) snake, x=2: (2,2) free, x=3: (3,2) food, x=4: (4,2) free, x=5: (5,2) snake (tail), x=6: (6,2) snake.\n\nSo free: (2,2), (4,2)\n\nAnd food at (3,2)\n\ny=3: x=1: (1,3) snake, x=2: (2,3) not listed, free? Snake: (1,3), (1,4), no (2,3), so free. x=3: (3,3) not listed, free. x=4: (4,3) head, snake. x=5: (5,3) food. x=6: (6,3) not listed, free.\n\nSo y=3: free (2,3), (3,3), (6,3); snake (1,3), (4,3), (5,3) food.\n\n(5,3) is food, not snake body.\n\ny=4: x=1: (1,4) snake, x=2: (2,4) not listed, free? Snake: (1,4), (1,5), no (2,4), so free. x=3: (3,4) not listed, free? Snake has (3,5), but not (3,4). Positions: (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), no (3,4), so free. x=4: (4,4) snake, x=5: (5,4) not listed, free? x=6: (6,4) not listed, free.\n\ny=4: x=1: (1,4) snake, x=2: (2,4) free, x=3: (3,4) free, x=4: (4,4) snake, x=5: (5,4) free, x=6: (6,4) free.\n\ny=5: x=1: (1,5) snake, x=2: (2,5) snake, x=3: (3,5) snake, x=4: (4,5) snake, x=5: (5,5) not listed, free? x=6: (6,5) not listed, free.\n\nBut (4,6) is obstacle, not on y=5.\n\ny=5: x=5 and x=6 free, but (5,5) and (6,5).\n\ny=6: x=1 to 6: (4,6) obstacle, but other cells? (1,6) not wall? y=6 is not border, border is y=7 and y=0.\n\ny=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=6 is inner.\n\nBut (4,6) is internal obstacle, so blocked.\n\nOther cells: x=1, y=6: not snake, free? Snake positions up to y=5, so (1,6) free. Similarly (2,6) free, (3,6) free, (5,6) free, (6,6) free.\n\nExcept (4,6) blocked.\n\nSo free cells: (2,2), (4,2), (2,3), (3,3), (6,3), (2,4), (3,4), (5,4), (6,4), (5,5), (6,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (5,6), (6,6), and food at (3,2), (5,3).\n\n(3,2) is food, so it's a cell, but occupied by food, not free for movement unless eating.\n\nSimilarly (5,3).\n\nAlso, (4,2) is free, etc.\n\nFor the snake, moving to a free cell is safe, moving to food cell is eating.\n\nNow, back to current move.\n\nIf I move R to (5,3), I eat the food, length 18.\n\nThen head at (5,3), direction R (since moved right).\n\nThen possible next moves: from (5,3), can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so cannot move L (left, opposite of right).\n\nCan move U to (5,4), D to (5,2), R to (6,3).\n\n(5,4) is free, (5,2) is the tail, but tail will move when we move, so it might be safe.\n\nIf I move D to (5,2), which is the current tail position.\n\nWhen head moves to (5,2), but at that time, the tail is still at (5,2), but in the new state, after move, the tail has moved.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nCurrent state, head at (4,3), tail at (5,2).\n\nIf I move head to (5,3), as above, after move and eat, head at (5,3), tail at (5,2), and body includes (5,2) as new segment.\n\nIf from (5,3) I move D to (5,2), but (5,2) is now occupied by the tail segment.\n\nIn the new positions after eating: head (5,3), body: (4,3), (4,4), ..., (6,2), (5,2)\n\nSo (5,2) is the tail.\n\nIf I move head down to (5,2), that is the same cell as the tail. But when head moves to (5,2), the tail will move away if no eat, but since we are moving to it, and it's occupied, it would be collision, unless the tail moves first.\n\nIn snake mechanics, when head moves to a cell, if that cell is occupied by a body segment, it is collision, except if it is the tail cell, because the tail moves away.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving to the tail cell is safe because the tail moves, so the cell is vacated.\n\nIn this case, from (5,3) moving to (5,2), which is tail, so it should be safe, and no food there now, since we ate at (5,3).\n\nAfter moving to (5,2), the tail moves to the previous position, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, if there was food, but here no.\n\nBut in this case, from (5,3), moving to (5,2) is safe.\n\nMoving to (5,4) or (6,3) also safe.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (3,2).\n\nIt has life span 7, so I have time, but the snake is large, and the area around (3,2) might be tight.\n\n(3,2) is at (3,2), surrounded by: (3,1) snake, (3,3) free, (2,2) free, (4,2) free.\n\nSo to eat it, I need to move head to (3,2).\n\nFrom current position (4,3), I can go left to (3,3), then down to (3,2), or down to (4,2), then left to (3,2).\n\nIf I go directly to (5,3), I am farther away.\n\nBut (5,3) will disappear later, life span 10, so I can eat it later.\n\nHowever, if I don't eat (5,3) now, someone might eat it? No, only the snake can eat, so it will stay until eaten or expired.\n\nBut the snake can choose when to eat.\n\nFor long-term, eating both is good, but I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nThe area on the right has more free space: cells like (5,4), (6,3), (6,4), (5,5), (6,5), (6,6), etc.\n\nLeft side, near (3,2), there is (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,3), (3,4), but below y=2 is wall or snake, y=1 all snake, so limited.\n\nAlso, above, y=6 has free cells, but (4,6) blocked, so I need to go around.\n\nPerhaps I should go towards the more open area.\n\nLet's plan a path.\n\nFirst, if I move down to (4,2) now.\n\nFrom (4,3) move D to (4,2).\n\nThen head at (4,2), direction D.\n\nThen I can move L to (3,2) to eat the food, or R to (5,2), but (5,2) is tail, or U to (4,3), but (4,3) is now body, since we moved from it.\n\nAfter moving to (4,2), new positions: head (4,2), then body (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), ..., up to (6,2), and tail (5,2) moves to where? Old tail (5,2), no eat, so tail moves away.\n\nCurrent positions before move: S[0]=(4,3), S[1]=(4,4), ..., S[16]=(5,2)\n\nMove head to (4,2), no eat.\n\nNew head (4,2)\n\nNew body[1] = old S[0] = (4,3)\n\nNew body[2] = old S[1] = (4,4)\n\n...\n\nNew body[16] = old S[15] = (6,2)  // since old S[15] is (6,2), old S[16] is (5,2) tail, but no eat, so no new segment, new tail is new body[16] = old S[15] = (6,2)\n\nOld S[15] is (6,2), which was body, now it becomes the tail.\n\nOld tail (5,2) is discarded.\n\nSo new snake: head (4,2), then (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) tail.\n\nTail at (6,2).\n\nNow from (4,2), I can move to (3,2) to eat food.\n\n(3,2) has food, value +1.\n\nMove L to (3,2).\n\nThen eat, so new length 18.\n\nHead at (3,2), direction L (left).\n\nThen from there, I can move U to (3,3), or D to (3,1), but (3,1) is body, or L to (2,2).\n\n(3,1) is body, so cannot move there, collision.\n\nL to (2,2) free, U to (3,3) free.\n\nBut (3,1) is occupied, so only U or L.\n\nD to (3,1) is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, if I don't eat now, but I can.\n\nAfter eating at (3,2), head at (3,2), then I need to move to free space.\n\nFor example, move U to (3,3), then from there to (2,3) or (3,4) or (4,3), but (4,3) is body now.\n\nAfter moving to (3,2) and eating, positions: head (3,2), body (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), ..., (6,1), (6,2), and new tail at old tail position, which was (6,2), so new segment at (6,2), so tail at (6,2).\n\nList: new head (3,2), new body[1] = old head position (4,2), new body[2] = old body[1] = (4,3), ..., new body[16] = old body[15] = (6,1)? Old positions after first move to (4,2): head (4,2), body (4,3), (4,4), ..., (6,1), (6,2) tail.\n\nIndex: new after move to (4,2): S'[0] = (4,2), S'[1] = (4,3), S'[2] = (4,4), S'[3] = (4,5), S'[4] = (3,5), S'[5] = (2,5), S'[6] = (1,5), S'[7] = (1,4), S'[8] = (1,3), S'[9] = (1,2), S'[10] = (1,1), S'[11] = (2,1), S'[12] = (3,1), S'[13] = (4,1), S'[14] = (5,1), S'[15] = (6,1), S'[16] = (6,2)  // tail\n\nNow from here, move head to (3,2) and eat.\n\nNew head (3,2)\n\nNew body[1] = old head (4,2)\n\nNew body[2] = old body[1] = (4,3)\n\n...\nNew body[16] = old body[15] = (6,1)\n\nThen new body[17] = old tail (6,2)  // since ate, add new segment\n\nSo tail at (6,2)\n\nHead at (3,2)\n\nFrom (3,2), can move to adjacent: U (3,3), D (3,1) but (3,1) is body, occupied, so invalid, collision. L (2,2), or R (4,2) but (4,2) is now body, occupied by S'[1] in new list, which is (4,2), so occupied, cannot move there. Only possible moves: U to (3,3) or L to (2,2).\n\n(2,2) is free, (3,3) is free.\n\nSo after eating at (3,2), I can go to (2,2) or (3,3).\n\nThe bottom is blocked, so I need to go up or left.\n\n(2,2) is available, then to (2,3), etc.\n\nBut the area is a bit tight.\n\nIf I eat at (5,3) first, I go to the right, where there is more space.\n\nFor example, from (4,3) move R to (5,3) eat.\n\nHead at (5,3), direction R.\n\nNew positions: head (5,3), body (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), and tail (5,2)\n\nFrom (5,3), I can move U to (5,4), D to (5,2), or R to (6,3).\n\n(5,4) free, (5,2) tail, safe, (6,3) free.\n\nThen, for example, move U to (5,4), then to (5,5) or (6,4), etc., towards the open area.\n\nThe food at (3,2) can be eaten later, within 7 turns.\n\nLife span 7 at turn 67, so I have until turn 73 to eat it.\n\nFrom the right side, I can go down and left to reach (3,2), but it might take a few turns.\n\nLet's estimate the distance.\n\nFrom (5,3) to (3,2): delta x= -2, delta y= -1, so at least 3 moves: e.g., left to (4,3), but (4,3) is body, not free. From (5,3), I can move left to (4,3)? But (4,3) is occupied by body, so cannot move there directly.\n\nAfter moving to (5,3), (4,3) is body, so from (5,3), moving left to (4,3) is impossible, collision.\n\nSo from (5,3), I can only move U, D, R, not L because it's reverse or occupied.\n\nCurrent direction after moving right is R, so from (5,3), direction R, so I can move U, D, R, not L (left, opposite).\n\nAnd (4,3) is occupied, so only options U, D, R.\n\nIf I move D to (5,2), which is tail, safe, then from (5,2), I can move to (5,1) but (5,1) is body, or (4,2), or (6,2) but (6,2) is body.\n\nAfter moving to (5,3), positions: head (5,3), body (4,3), (4,4), ..., (6,2), (5,2) tail.\n\nFrom (5,3) move D to (5,2): head to (5,2), which is tail, so safe, no eat (no food), new head (5,2), body shifts, new body[1] = (5,3), new body[2] = (4,3), etc., new tail at (6,2) or something.\n\nOld tail (5,2) is moved from, so new positions: head (5,2), body (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), ..., (6,1), (6,2)  // (6,2) becomes tail.\n\nThen from (5,2), I can move L to (4,2), or D to (5,1) but (5,1) body, occupied, or R to (6,2) but (6,2) is tail, or U to (5,3) but (5,3) is body.\n\n(5,3) is body, so only possible moves: L to (4,2) if free, or to (6,2) if tail.\n\n(4,2) is free, (6,2) is tail.\n\nSo can move L to (4,2) or to (6,2) tail.\n\nIf move to (4,2), then from there to (3,2) to eat food.\n\n(3,2) is adjacent to (4,2), so from (4,2) move L to (3,2) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, if I had gone to (4,2) directly from start.\n\nBut let's think about the sequence.\n\nPerhaps for long-term survival, it's better to go to the area with more space, like upper right, to avoid being trapped.\n\nThe food at (3,2) is in a corner with limited access, so eating it might risk trapping the snake.\n\nFor example, after eating at (3,2), the only exits are to (2,2) or (3,3), both of which might lead to dead ends if not careful.\n\nWhereas the food at (5,3) is in a more open area, and eating it allows moving to (5,4) or (6,3), then to (5,5), (6,4), etc., which have more free cells.\n\nAlso, there is food at (3,2) with shorter life span, 7 vs 10, but 7 turns is enough to reach it from the right.\n\nFor example, from current position, if I move to (5,3) now, then I can go up to (5,4), then to (5,5) or (6,4), then from there I can head down and left to (3,2).\n\nBut it might take several turns.\n\nLet's plan a path to (3,2) from (5,3).\n\nFrom (5,3) move U to (5,4) (turn 68)\n\nThen from (5,4) move U to (5,5) (turn 69)\n\nThen from (5,5) move L to (4,5) but (4,5) is body? At turn 67, after moving to (5,3), positions include (4,5), which is body.\n\nAfter turn 67: head at (5,3), body (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), etc.\n\nSo at turn 68, from (5,3) move U to (5,4), no eat, new head (5,4), body (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), ..., tail (5,2) moves, new tail at (6,2) or something.\n\nAfter turn 67 eat at (5,3): positions: head (5,3), body (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), tail (5,2)\n\nFor turn 68, move U to (5,4): (5,4) is free, no food, so move, new head (5,4), body (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), ..., (6,1), (6,2), and tail (5,2) moves away, new tail at (6,2)? Old tail (5,2), no eat, so new positions: head (5,4), body (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), and tail (6,2)  // since (6,2) was second last, now last.\n\n(6,2) is now tail.\n\nFrom (5,4), can move U to (5,5), or L to (4,4) but (4,4) is body, occupied, or R to (6,4), or D to (5,3) but (5,3) is body.\n\nSo possible U to (5,5) or R to (6,4) or D to (5,3) invalid, so U or R.\n\nSay move U to (5,5) turn 69.\n\nThen from (5,5) move L to (4,5) but (4,5) is body, or U to (5,6), or R to (6,5), or D to (5,4) body.\n\n(4,5) body, (5,4) body, so only U to (5,6) or R to (6,5).\n\n(5,6) and (6,5) are free.\n\nSay move to (5,6) turn 69.\n\nThen from (5,6) can move to other cells.\n\nBut to reach (3,2), it's far, and I need to go down and left.\n\nBut the body is blocking the left side.\n\nFrom the current state, if I want to eat (3,2) first, it's closer.\n\nFrom (4,3) move L to (3,3) turn 67.\n\nThen from (3,3) move D to (3,2) to eat turn 68.\n\nBut after turn 67 move L to (3,3): no eat, new head (3,3), body (4,3), (4,4), etc., tail moves.\n\nThen turn 68 move D to (3,2) eat.\n\nThen as before, at (3,2), can move to (2,2) or (3,3).\n\n(3,3) is now body, so only (2,2).\n\nMove to (2,2) turn 69.\n\nThen from (2,2) can move U to (2,3), or L to (1,2) but (1,2) body, or D to (2,1) body, or R to (3,2) but (3,2) is head previous, now body or food gone.\n\nAfter eating at (3,2), positions: head (3,2), body (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), ..., tail at (6,2)\n\nFrom (3,2) move to (2,2) turn 68? Let's timeline.\n\nTurn 67: from (4,3) move L to (3,3)  no eat\n\nNew head (3,3), body (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) tail\n\nTurn 68: move D to (3,2) and eat\n\nNew head (3,2), body (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), ..., (6,1), (6,2), and new tail at (6,2)? Old tail (6,2), so new segment at (6,2), but it's the same, tail at (6,2)\n\nPositions: head (3,2), body (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), tail (6,2)\n\nFrom (3,2), move to (2,2) turn 69 (since (3,3) is body, (3,1) body, so only (2,2) or (4,2) but (4,2) not adjacent? Adjacent cells: U (3,3) body, D (3,1) body, L (2,2), R (4,2)  (4,2) is free and adjacent.\n\n(4,2) is at (4,2), which is adjacent to (3,2)? (3,2) and (4,2) share x difference 1, y same, so yes, right.\n\n(3,2) to (4,2) is right, x+1.\n\nSo from (3,2), can move L to (2,2) or R to (4,2).\n\n(2,2) free, (4,2) free.\n\nSay move L to (2,2) turn 69.\n\nThen from (2,2) can move U to (2,3), or L to (1,2) body, D to (2,1) body, R to (3,2) body, so only U to (2,3).\n\nMove to (2,3) turn 70.\n\nThen from (2,3) can move U to (2,4), or R to (3,3) body, or L to (1,3) body, D to (2,2) but (2,2) is now body or previous position.\n\nAfter move to (2,3), positions change.\n\nThis is getting messy, and the snake is stuck in the top-left with limited moves.\n\nWhereas if I go to the right, I have more options.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (4,6) blocks the center, but on the right, I can go to (5,6), (6,6), etc.\n\nMoreover, there might be more food later, but in this state, only two food.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should eat both if possible.\n\nBut survival first.\n\nPerhaps the best is to eat (5,3) now, then move to the open area, and later if possible, go for (3,2), but it might be risky due to time and space.\n\nLife span of (3,2) is 7, so after turn 67, it has 6 turns left to be eaten (turns 68 to 73), disappears at turn 74.\n\nFrom the right, it takes at least 3-4 turns to reach (3,2), but with body blocking, it might be difficult.\n\nFor example, from (5,3) at turn 67, after eating.\n\nTurn 68: move D to (5,2)  // to (5,2) tail, safe\n\nThen from (5,2) move L to (4,2) turn 69\n\nThen from (4,2) move L to (3,2) to eat turn 70\n\nSo on turn 70, I can eat (3,2), within the life span.\n\nLife span at turn 67 is 7, so on turn 70, it is still there, life span decreases to 4 at turn 70? At turn 67, life span 7.\n\nAfter turn 67, life span 6.\n\nAfter turn 68, life span 5.\n\nAfter turn 69, life span 4.\n\nAt turn 70, before action, life span 4, so can be eaten.\n\nSo I can eat it on turn 70.\n\nSimilarly, if I go directly from (4,3) to (4,2) turn 67, then to (3,2) turn 68, faster.\n\nBut eating (5,3) first gives a point now, and then I can still eat (3,2) later.\n\nIf I eat (3,2) first, I might not be able to eat (5,3) if I get trapped.\n\n(5,3) has life span 10, so plenty of time.\n\nSo probably better to eat (5,3) now for immediate reward, then go to (4,2) and eat (3,2) on the way.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 67: move R to (5,3) eat food\n\nThen turn 68: from (5,3) move D to (5,2)  // (5,2) tail, safe\n\nThen turn 69: from (5,2) move L to (4,2)  // (4,2) free\n\nThen turn 70: from (4,2) move L to (3,2) eat food\n\nNow, after that, I need to think further.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to provide actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nThe current turn is 67, so I need actions for turn 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, etc.\n\nAlso, after turn 70, what to do.\n\nAfter eating at (3,2) on turn 70, head at (3,2), then I can move to (2,2) or (3,3), but (3,3) might be body.\n\nAfter turn 70 eat at (3,2), positions depend on previous.\n\nLet's simulate from turn 67.\n\nTurn 67: move R to (5,3) eat. Head now (5,3), direction R. Snake length 18.\n\nPositions: head (5,3), body: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), tail (5,2)\n\nTurn 68: move D to (5,2). (5,2) is tail, so safe, no eat. Direction D.\n\nNew head (5,2), body: (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), tail (6,2)  // old tail (5,2) moved from, new tail (6,2)\n\nTurn 69: move L to (4,2). (4,2) free, no food. Direction L.\n\nNew head (4,2), body: (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), tail (6,1)  // after shift, new tail (6,1)\n\nTurn 70: move L to (3,2) eat food. Head to (3,2), eat, length 19. Direction L.\n\nNew head (3,2), body: (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), tail (6,1) and new segment at old tail (6,1)? After eat, add new segment.\n\nNew positions: head (3,2), body (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), and tail (6,1)  // since old tail (6,1) position, new segment there.\n\nNow from (3,2), adjacent cells: U (3,3), but (3,3) is not directly occupied? Body positions: (4,2), (5,2), etc., no (3,3), so (3,3) free? Also D (3,1), which is in body, (3,1) is body. L (2,2), free? R (4,2) but (4,2) is body, occupied.\n\nSo U (3,3) free, D (3,1) body, invalid, L (2,2) free, R (4,2) body, invalid.\n\nSo can move U to (3,3) or L to (2,2).\n\nSay move U to (3,3) turn 71.\n\nThen from (3,3), can move to (2,3), (3,4), or (4,3) but (4,3) body.\n\n(2,3) free, (3,4) free, (4,3) body.\n\nSo can go to (2,3) or (3,4).\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut I need to provide actions up to turn 71 or more.\n\nSince the food at (3,2) is eaten, and (5,3) eaten, no more food, so I just need to survive and explore.\n\nBut for the answer, I can plan the first few moves.\n\nNow, for turn 67, I think moving right to eat (5,3) is good.\n\nThen move down to (5,2), then left to (4,2), then left to (3,2) to eat, then up to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut let's confirm the directions.\n\nCurrent head direction D, so for turn 67, move R to (5,3).\n\nThen turn 68, from (5,3) direction R, move D to (5,2), possible since not reverse.\n\nThen turn 69, from (5,2) direction D? Last move was D to (5,2), so direction D, move L to (4,2), which is left, not reverse (reverse would be up), so ok.\n\nThen turn 70, from (4,2) direction L, move L to (3,2), again left, not reverse.\n\nThen turn 71, from (3,2) direction L, move U to (3,3), which is up, not reverse.\n\nNow, I need at least 5 turns: turns 67 to 71.\n\nTurn 71 is included.\n\n67,68,69,70,71: five actions.\n\nThen I can stop or continue.\n\nIn the sequence above, I have actions up to turn 70 for eating, and turn 71 move U.\n\nTo be complete, let's write the actions.\n\nBut in turn 71, from (3,3), I can move to (2,3) or (3,4), but I need to specify.\n\nSince no food, it doesn't matter much, as long as safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can go towards open area.\n\nBut for the answer, I think this sequence is fine.\n\nAnother option: if I move down to (4,2) on turn 67, then to (3,2) on turn 68, then I eat (3,2) earlier, but then I might miss (5,3) or eat it later, but (5,3) has longer life.\n\nBut with the sequence above, I eat both.\n\nMoreover, by going right first, I am in a better position.\n\nSo I think move R on turn 67.\n\nThen the actions:\n\nTurn 67: R\n\nTurn 68: D\n\nTurn 69: L\n\nTurn 70: L (to eat (3,2))\n\nThen turn 71: U (to (3,3))\n\nNow, for turn 71, from (3,2) after turn 70, head at (3,2), move U to (3,3).\n\nThen for later turns, I can add if needed, but 5 turns should be enough.\n\nTurn 67 to 71 is 5 actions.\n\nAnswer format: actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nt1=67.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 67: R\n\nTurn 68: D\n\nTurn 69: L\n\nTurn 70: L\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nBut on turn 70, I move L to (3,2) to eat, which is fine.\n\nAnd on turn 71, move U to (3,3).\n\nNow, is there any risk?\n\nFor example, on turn 68, moving to (5,2) which was tail, safe.\n\nOn turn 69, moving to (4,2), free.\n\nOn turn 70, to (3,2) eat.\n\nAll safe.\n\nAnd I eat both food, so score +2.\n\nIf I eat (3,2) first, I might not get (5,3) if trapped.\n\nSo this seems better.\n\nMoreover, thinking 5+ turns ahead, after turn 71, I can go to (2,3) or (3,4), both free, and then to more open cells.\n\nFor example, from (3,3) move to (2,3) or (3,4).\n\n(2,3) then to (2,4), etc.\n\nBut not necessary for answer.\n\nSo I think this is good.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, the AI must prioritize eating both positive food items—(3,2) and (5,3)—within their life spans while avoiding collisions and dead ends. The food at (3,2) has a life span of 7 (disappearing after turn 73), and the food at (5,3) has a life span of 10 (disappearing after turn 76). Given the snake's current position and direction, moving right to eat (5,3) immediately is optimal for an early score gain. Then, maneuvering down and left allows eating (3,2) by turn 70, well within its life span. After eating both, moving up to (3,3) opens access to more free space (e.g., (2,3) or (3,4)) for future exploration and survival.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Immediate Action (Turn 67)**: Move right to (5,3) to eat the food (+1 score, length 18). This leverages proximity and avoids delaying the reward.\n- **Subsequent Moves**: \n  - Turn 68: Move down to (5,2), which is safe (tail cell, vacates upon movement).\n  - Turn 69: Move left to (4,2), positioning to reach (3,2).\n  - Turn 70: Move left to (3,2) to eat the food (+1 score, length 19).\n  - Turn 71: Move up to (3,3) to avoid the congested bottom-left area and access open cells.\n- **Risk Avoidance**: \n  - No wall or body collisions occur in this sequence.\n  - Tail Reward Danger is irrelevant here; (5,2) is not adjacent to the head when (5,3) is eaten.\n  - After turn 71, the snake can explore open areas (e.g., (2,3) or (3,4)) for long-term survival.\n- **5+ Turn Outlook**: \n  - By turn 71, both foods are eaten, maximizing score early.\n  - Future turns (beyond 71) can focus on navigating to the upper-right (e.g., (5,4), (6,3)) where more free space exists, reducing trapping risk.\n\n### Action Plan:\nThe actions for turns 67 to 71 are as follows:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 67: R (right)  \nTurn 68: D (down)  \nTurn 69: L (left)  \nTurn 70: L (left)  \nTurn 71: U (up)  \n}",

    {
        "step": 68,
        "score": 17,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 68, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm.\n\nWalls: border cells x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. So, the grid goes from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, but since walls occupy those, the snake can only be on cells from (1,1) to (6,6). Also, there's an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (5,3), and direction is right (R). The positions are: [(5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2)]\n\nThat's 18 segments. Let me list them in order:\n\n- Head: (5,3)\n\n- Then (4,3), so from head to second segment is left, but head direction is R, which is inconsistent? Head at (5,3), moving right would be to (6,3), but previous position is (4,3), which is left of head, so the snake was moving left to get to (5,3)? But current head direction is given as R. I need to see the history.\n\nHead direction is the direction it moved to get to current position, I think. The state says \"Snake Head Direction: R\", which should be the direction it is facing now, meaning it came from the left, so from (4,3) to (5,3), so it moved right to current position.\n\nBut in the positions list, (5,3) is head, then (4,3) is the first body segment, so yes, it moved from (4,3) to (5,3), so direction is right.\n\nNow, food: only one food item at (3,2) with value 1 and life span 6. So it's positive food, disappears after 6 turns, including this turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 68, life span 6, so it will disappear after turn 73? Let's see: at turn 68, life span 6; turn 69, it becomes 5; ... down to turn 73, it becomes 1, then on turn 74 it disappears? Or does it disappear when life span reaches 0?\n\nThe rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\". So if life span is N at turn t, it decreases to N-1 at turn t+1, and disappears when it reaches 0. So for food at (3,2) with life span 6 at turn 68:\n\n- Turn 68: life span 6\n\n- Turn 69: 5\n\n- Turn 70: 4\n\n- Turn 71: 3\n\n- Turn 72: 2\n\n- Turn 73: 1\n\n- Turn 74: 0, disappears, so it can be eaten until turn 73 inclusive? No, it can be eaten as long as it exists, so from turn 68 to 73, since at turn 73 life span is 1, it's still there, and after move, if head moves onto it, it can be eaten, and then it disappears or something. But the eating happens when head moves onto the cell, and the food is there.\n\nTypically, the food is present and can be eaten on the turn when life span is >=1. After the move, if head is on food, it's eaten, and food is consumed. Then the food might respawn or something, but here no respawn mentioned, so only this one food for now.\n\nNow, the snake head is at (5,3), moving right. Possible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1). But no instant reverse, so since it just moved right to (5,3), it cannot move left immediately, because left would be opposite of current direction. Current direction is R, so opposite is L, so cannot move L. So possible moves: U, D, R.\n\nNow, let's see the grid to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, walls: border walls, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nPlayable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except where walls or obstacles.\n\n(4,6) is an obstacle, so that cell is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: let's list all occupied cells by snake.\n\nHead: (5,3)\n\nBody: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2)\n\nAnd tail is (5,2), I think. Positions are given from head to tail, so last is tail: (5,2).\n\nNow, to find where the snake will be after moving, the tail moves when head moves, unless food is eaten.\n\nFor collision, if head moves to a cell that is occupied by body, it dies. But it can move to the tail cell because the tail will move away.\n\nSpecifically, if head moves to the current tail position, it's ok because after moving, the tail leaves that cell.\n\nBut if it moves to any other body cell, collision.\n\nAlso, if it moves into a wall.\n\nNow, possible moves from (5,3):\n\n- U: (5,4)  -- is this free? Check if wall or snake.\n\ny=4, x=5, within 1-6, no wall. Snake positions: is (5,4) occupied? From list: (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2). No (5,4), so free? But let's see the positions carefully.\n\n(5,3) is head, then (4,3), (4,4), etc. (5,4) not listed, so should be free.\n\n- D: (5,2) -- now (5,2) is the tail. So moving to (5,2) is moving to tail position. Since tail will move, it might be ok, but we need to see if after move, it collides.\n\nAfter moving, if head moves to (5,2), and since it's the tail, after the move, the tail segment is removed from there (unless food eaten), so the head occupies (5,2), and tail moves forward, so no collision.\n\nBut only if it's exactly the tail cell. If it were a body cell, not tail, it would collide.\n\n- R: (6,3) -- x=6, y=3. x=6 is not wall? Walls: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=6 is ok, y=3 ok. Is (6,3) occupied? Snake positions: (6,1), (6,2), but not (6,3). (6,1) and (6,2) are there, but (6,3) not listed, so free.\n\n- L: not possible, since opposite direction.\n\nSo possible actions: U to (5,4), D to (5,2), R to (6,3).\n\nNow, need to think ahead 5+ turns to maximize score, prioritize survival.\n\nThere is food at (3,2) with value 1, life span 6, so it will be available until turn 73, as I calculated.\n\nTurn 68 now, life span 6, so at turn 73, life span 1, still there; after turn 73 move, if not eaten, it disappears when life span decrements to 0.\n\nBut we can eat it on any turn from 68 to 73.\n\nNow, the food is at (3,2). Where is the snake? Head at (5,3), so (3,2) is two left and one down, or something. From (5,3) to (3,2): delta x = -2, delta y = -1, so not adjacent.\n\nCurrent head: (5,3)\n\nFood: (3,2)\n\nTo reach (3,2), need to move left and down.\n\nBut there might be obstacles.\n\nAlso, the snake body is around.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid from x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\nWalls: borders and (4,6) obstacle.\n\nSnake positions:\n\nLet's list by coordinates for clarity:\n\n- Row y=6: (4,5) is snake? Positions: (4,5) at index 3, but y=5? y values: from positions, y=1,2,3,4,5.\n\ny from 1 to 5, no y=6? y=5 has (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5)\n\ny=4: (4,4), (1,4)\n\ny=3: (5,3), (4,3), (1,3)\n\ny=2: (1,2), (6,2), (5,2) — (1,2), (6,2), (5,2)\n\ny=1: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\nSo let's make a grid view:\n\nAssume x from left to right, y from bottom to top? Usually in grids, y=1 bottom, y=6 top, but in coordinates, (x,y), with y increasing up or down? In the positions, (1,1) to (1,5), so y=1 is bottom, y=5 is top? But walls y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to 6 should be playable, but here snake only up to y=5, and obstacle at (4,6) which is y=6.\n\ny=6: (4,6) is obstacle, so not accessible.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 and y=7 walls.\n\nx=0 and x=7 walls.\n\nSo playable cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 except (4,6) is obstacle.\n\nBut y=6 only (4,6) blocked, other cells at y=6 are free? But not occupied by snake.\n\nIn snake positions, no y=6, so y=6 cells: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) obstacle, (5,6), (6,6) — all free except (4,6).\n\nSimilarly, y=1 to 5 have snake bodies.\n\nBack to head at (5,3).\n\nFood at (3,2).\n\n(3,2) is occupied? Snake positions: (1,2), (2,1), (3,1), etc, no (3,2) listed. (3,2) not in snake positions, so it should be free for food, but food is there.\n\nFood at (3,2), so it's not snake body, since food can be under body? Rule says food can spawn under snake body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves on.\n\nHere, is (3,2) under snake body?\n\nLook at snake positions: (1,2) is there, but (3,2) not listed, so not occupied by snake, so food is on free cell.\n\nSimilarly, no other food.\n\nNow, to reach (3,2) from (5,3).\n\nPossible paths.\n\nBut we need to think multiple moves ahead.\n\nFirst, on turn 68, I need to choose action.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, R (L not allowed).\n\nU: to (5,4)\n\nD: to (5,2) — which is tail\n\nR: to (6,3)\n\nNow, let's see what happens after each.\n\nAlso, food at (3,2), life span 6, so we have time, but need to plan to eat it.\n\nMoreover, the rule about tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nHere, tail is at (5,2), with no food, so not an issue now.\n\nBut if we eat food, tail grows, so new segment added.\n\nNow, let's simulate each choice.\n\nFirst, suppose move R to (6,3) on turn 68.\n\nThen head to (6,3), previous head (5,3) becomes body, tail (5,2) moves? When head moves, the tail moves only if no food eaten. Since no food at (6,3), no eat, so snake moves: new head (6,3), body segments shift, so the segment at tail (5,2) is removed, so new positions: head (6,3), then (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), ..., up to (6,2)? Original positions: after move, the body is the previous positions except tail removed.\n\nSnake was: [(5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2)]\n\nAfter move R to (6,3), no food, so new head (6,3), and the body is all except the tail (5,2), so the new body starts from previous head (5,3) to the second last, which is (6,2)? The positions list: index 0: (5,3) head, index 1: (4,3), ..., index 17: (5,2) tail.\n\nAfter move to (6,3), new head (6,3), and the body segments are the previous positions from index 0 to 16, but index 0 was head, now it becomes first body segment, so new positions: [(6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)]\n\nThe tail was (5,2), which is removed, so the new tail is (6,2), which was second last.\n\nPrevious positions had 18 segments, after move no eat, so 18 segments, but head moved, tail moved, so length same.\n\nNew positions: head (6,3), then (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) — that's 18 positions, yes.\n\nNow, head at (6,3), direction R.\n\nFrom here, possible moves: U to (6,4), D to (6,2), L to (5,3) but L is opposite to current direction R? Current direction after move: head moved from (5,3) to (6,3), so direction R, so cannot move L to (5,3) because opposite.\n\nSo possible: U, D, R. R to (7,3) but x=7 is wall, so invalid. So only U or D.\n\nU to (6,4): is it free? y=4, x=6, not wall. Snake: (6,4) not in positions, so free.\n\nD to (6,2): (6,2) is now the tail? In new positions, (6,2) is tail, so moving to tail is ok.\n\nBut let's not go too deep yet.\n\nBack to turn 68 choices.\n\nOption 2: move D to (5,2) on turn 68.\n\n(5,2) is the current tail. So move head to (5,2).\n\nSince no food there, no eat, so snake moves: new head (5,2), and body: previous head (5,3) becomes body, and tail (5,2) was there, but since head moves to it, and no food, the tail is removed, so new positions: head (5,2), then (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) — (6,2) was second last, now tail.\n\nPrevious tail (5,2) is gone, so new tail is (6,2)? List: previous positions, after move, new head (5,2), then segments: previous index 0 (5,3), index 1 (4,3), ..., up to index 16 (6,1), index 17 (6,2)? Index 17 was (5,2) which is tail, removed. So body from index 0 to 16: index 0 (5,3), index 1 (4,3), index 2 (4,4), ..., index 15 (5,1), index 16 (6,1), and index 17 (6,2) but index 17 is tail, removed, so the last body is index 16 (6,1), but we need to include the new head.\n\nNew positions: head (5,2), then the first body is previous head (5,3), then (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), and then (6,2) is the last? Previous positions had (6,1) and (6,2), (6,1) was index 15, (6,2) index 16? Let's number indices.\n\nPrevious positions: index 0: (5,3) head, 1: (4,3), 2: (4,4), 3: (4,5), 4: (3,5), 5: (2,5), 6: (1,5), 7: (1,4), 8: (1,3), 9: (1,2), 10: (1,1), 11: (2,1), 12: (3,1), 13: (4,1), 14: (5,1), 15: (6,1), 16: (6,2), 17: (5,2) tail.\n\nAfter move D to (5,2): new head (5,2), which was tail. No food, so tail removed. New body: positions from index 0 to 16: (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nBut (6,2) is included, and new head is (5,2), so new positions: [(5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)]\n\nNew tail is (6,2).\n\nHead at (5,2), direction: since it moved down from (5,3) to (5,2), so direction D.\n\nThen possible moves: U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so cannot move U (opposite of D), so can move L to (4,2), R to (6,2), or D to (5,1).\n\n(5,1) is body, (6,2) is tail, (4,2) may be free.\n\n(4,2) not in positions, so free.\n\nBut we are at turn 68.\n\nOption 3: move U to (5,4) on turn 68.\n\n(5,4) is free, no food, so new head (5,4), body: (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (5,2) but tail (5,2) removed, so new positions: head (5,4), then (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nNew tail (6,2).\n\nHead direction U.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (5,5), D to (5,3) but D opposite, cannot, L to (4,4), R to (6,4).\n\n(5,5) : y=5, x=5, not wall, is it free? Snake: (4,5) is body, (3,5), etc, but (5,5) not listed, so free.\n\n(4,4) is body, so cannot move L to (4,4) because it's occupied by body, not tail.\n\n(4,4) is a body segment, not tail, so moving to it would collide.\n\nSimilarly, R to (6,4) free.\n\nU to (5,5) free.\n\nD not allowed.\n\nNow, food at (3,2) is south-west.\n\nTo eat it, we need to get to (3,2).\n\nFrom current position (5,3), (3,2) is at (x-2,y-1).\n\nPossible paths: for example, move L then D, but L not allowed now.\n\nOr move D to (5,2), then from there, (5,2) is closer, (3,2) is left 2, down 0? (5,2) to (3,2) is delta x=-2, delta y=0.\n\nFrom (5,2), can move L to (4,2), then L to (3,2).\n\nBut (4,2) and (3,2) need to be free.\n\n(3,2) has food, so it's free for head to move to, but only if not occupied, which it's not.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) not occupied.\n\nBut let's see the body.\n\nAlso, life span 6, so we have 6 turns to eat it.\n\nBut we need to plan multiple moves.\n\nMoreover, the snake is long, 18 segments, so space might be tight.\n\nLook at the grid: the snake occupies a lot of cells, especially the bottom left area.\n\nFree cells: for example, top right might be free.\n\ny=6: cells (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) obstacle, (5,6), (6,6) all free except (4,6).\n\ny=5: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) occupied, (5,5) free, (6,5) free? Not listed, so free.\n\ny=4: (1,4) occupied, (2,4) free? Not listed, (3,4) free, (4,4) occupied, (5,4) free, (6,4) free.\n\ny=3: (1,3) occupied, (2,3) free, (3,3) free, (4,3) occupied, (5,3) occupied, (6,3) free.\n\ny=2: (1,2) occupied, (2,2) free, (3,2) food, (4,2) free, (5,2) occupied (tail), (6,2) occupied.\n\ny=1: all occupied except possibly (3,2) but y=1 has (1,1) to (6,1) occupied.\n\ny=1: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) all occupied.\n\ny=2: (1,2) occupied, (2,2) free, (3,2) food, (4,2) free, (5,2) occupied, (6,2) occupied.\n\nSo free cells: (2,2), (3,2) food, (4,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4)? y=4: (2,4) free, (3,4) free, (5,4) free, (6,4) free; y=5: (5,5) free, (6,5) free; y=6: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (5,6), (6,6) free.\n\nAnd (6,3) free, etc.\n\nTo reach (3,2) from (5,3), one way is to go down to (5,2), then left to (4,2), then left to (3,2).\n\nFrom (5,2), can go directly to (4,2) or (5,1) but (5,1) occupied, or (6,2) occupied, so only to (4,2) if free.\n\n(4,2) is free.\n\nThen from (4,2) to (3,2), which has food.\n\nBut when we eat at (3,2), the snake grows, so tail doesn't move, new segment added.\n\nBut let's see the tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it kills, but here tail is at (5,2), head at (5,3), not adjacent; after move to (5,2), head at (5,2), tail at (6,2), which are adjacent? (5,2) and (6,2) are adjacent horizontally.\n\nBut (6,2) has no food, so no issue.\n\nIf we go to (3,2) and eat, no problem.\n\nBut we need to think if it's safe to go there now.\n\nAnother way: go up or right to explore, but food might expire.\n\nLife span 6, so we can take a few turns.\n\nBut prioritize survival, so avoid risky moves.\n\nNow, possible moves at turn 68:\n\n- Move R to (6,3): then head at (6,3), with direction R, but x=6, so can only go U or D, since R to (7,3) wall, L not allowed.\n\nIf U to (6,4), then from there, can go to (6,5), (5,5), etc., away from food.\n\nIf D to (6,2), (6,2) is tail, so ok, but (6,2) might be occupied or not, but it's tail.\n\nAfter move to (6,3), as above, tail at (6,2), so moving D to (6,2) is moving to tail, ok.\n\nBut then from (6,2), can go to (6,1) but occupied, or (5,2) but not free, or (7,2) wall, or (6,3) but opposite if direction down? Let's not.\n\nPoint is, moving R might lead us to the right edge, which could be dead end if not careful.\n\nSimilarly, moving U to (5,4): then to (5,5) or (6,4), which is open area, but far from food.\n\nMoving D to (5,2): gets us closer to food at (3,2).\n\nFrom (5,2), we can go L to (4,2), then to (3,2) to eat.\n\nBut let's see if (4,2) is safe.\n\n(4,2) is free now.\n\nAfter moving to (5,2), as above, positions: head (5,2), body (5,3), (4,3), etc., tail (6,2).\n\nThen from (5,2), possible moves: L to (4,2), R to (6,2) tail, D to (5,1) but (5,1) is body, occupied, so cannot, U to (5,3) but (5,3) is body, and U is opposite if direction is D? After moving down to (5,2), direction D, so cannot move U to (5,3) because opposite.\n\nSo possible moves: L to (4,2), or R to (6,2) tail.\n\nR to (6,2) is moving to tail, ok.\n\nL to (4,2) free.\n\nIf we go L to (4,2), then head to (4,2), no food there, so snake moves, new head (4,2), body (5,2), (5,3), etc., tail removed.\n\nThen from (4,2), can move L to (3,2) to eat food.\n\n(3,2) has food, so if head moves to (3,2), it eats, snake grows, new tail added, so length increases.\n\nBut is there any danger?\n\nFirst, on turn 68, if we move D to (5,2), that's turn 68 action.\n\nThen on turn 69, from (5,2), move L to (4,2).\n\nThen on turn 70, from (4,2), move L to (3,2) to eat.\n\nNow, when we eat at (3,2) on turn 70, food life span: at turn 68, life 6; turn 69, life 5; turn 70, life 4, so still there.\n\nEat on turn 70.\n\nNow, after eating, snake grows, so new segment added at tail.\n\nBut let's see the positions before eating.\n\nOn turn 69, after moving to (4,2): positions.\n\nStart from turn 68: move D to (5,2), so new positions at turn 68 end: head (5,2), body (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) tail.\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 69: move L to (4,2).\n\n(4,2) is free, no food, so move head to (4,2), no eat, so new positions: head (4,2), then (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) — tail (6,2) removed, so new tail (6,1)? Previous tail (6,2) removed, so body from previous except tail.\n\nNew positions: head (4,2), then previous head (5,2), then (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) — and (6,1) is now tail.\n\n(6,1) was there, now tail.\n\nDirection: moved left from (5,2) to (4,2), so direction L.\n\nNow turn 70: move L to (3,2).\n\n(3,2) has food, positive, so head moves to (3,2), eats food, so snake grows: new head (3,2), the body is previous positions including the tail, so new positions: head (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) — and since ate, the tail (6,1) remains, and a new segment is added, but the new segment is added at the tail? When eating, the tail doesn't move, so the new position has the head at new position, and all previous body segments, so length increases by one.\n\nSo positions: new head (3,2), then the previous head (4,2), then previous body (5,2), (5,3), ..., up to previous tail (6,1), so 19 segments.\n\nNow, head at (3,2), direction L.\n\nNow, we have eaten the food, score +1.\n\nBut we need to survive after that.\n\nNow, from (3,2), possible moves: U to (3,3), D to (3,1), L to (2,2), R to (4,2) but R is opposite to current direction L? Moved left to (3,2), so direction L, so cannot move R to (4,2) because opposite.\n\nAlso, (3,1) is body, occupied, cannot move there.\n\n(4,2) is body, occupied, cannot move.\n\n(2,2) : is it free? From earlier, (2,2) should be free.\n\n(3,3) : free.\n\nSo possible: U to (3,3) or L to (2,2).\n\nBoth free.\n\nNow, the snake is longer, and the area around (3,2) might have bodies.\n\nAfter eating, the body includes (4,2), (5,2), etc.\n\n(3,3) is free, (2,2) free.\n\nBut (3,1) is body, so D not possible.\n\nAlso, walls, but (3,1) is not wall, but occupied.\n\nSo from here, can go to (3,3) or (2,2).\n\nIf go to (3,3), then from there, can go to (3,4), (2,3), etc.\n\n(3,4) free, (2,3) free.\n\nSimilarly, if go to (2,2), then to (2,1) but (2,1) body, or (1,2) body, or (2,3) free.\n\nSo can go up.\n\nSeems possible to survive.\n\nBut we need to think about the future after eating.\n\nAnother option: at turn 68, if we move U or R, we might not eat the food immediately, but later.\n\nBut with life span 6, we have until turn 73.\n\nTurn 68 to 73 is 6 turns, food available.\n\nIf we go away, we might not make it back in time.\n\nFor example, if move R to (6,3) on turn 68, then we are at (6,3), and need to go to (3,2), which is left 3, down 1, so at least 4 moves away, but with obstacles.\n\nFrom (6,3) to (3,2): need to go left three times and down once, but cannot directly, since grid.\n\nFor example, to (5,3) but (5,3) is body, occupied after move, so cannot go back.\n\nAfter move to (6,3), positions have (5,3) as body, so from (6,3), can go U to (6,4), D to (6,2), or since direction R, cannot L.\n\nU to (6,4), then from (6,4) can go to (6,5), (5,4), etc., or D to (6,3) but opposite.\n\nSay go to (6,4), then to (5,4) if possible, etc., to reach left side.\n\nBut (3,2) is at bottom left, while we are at right, so it might take many turns.\n\nSimilarly, if go U to (5,4) on turn 68, then to (5,5) or (6,4), still top right, far from (3,2).\n\nAnd with snake body, paths might be blocked.\n\nFor example, from current, the cell (2,2) is free, but surrounded by bodies: (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) food, (2,2) free, but (1,2) occupied, so (2,2) can be accessed from (2,3) or (3,2), but not directly from right.\n\nTo reach (3,2) from right, need to go through (4,2) or (3,3).\n\n(3,3) is free, (4,2) free.\n\nBut from (5,3), if we don't go down, it might be harder.\n\nMoreover, moving down to (5,2) is safe and gets closer.\n\nBut is moving to (5,2) safe? It's the tail, so no collision.\n\nThen from there, we can go to (4,2) safely.\n\nThen to (3,2) to eat.\n\nOn turn 70, as above.\n\nNow, after eating, we are at (3,2), with direction L, and can go U to (3,3) or L to (2,2).\n\n(2,2) is free, (3,3) free.\n\nNow, the grid has free space above, like (2,3), (3,3), (2,4), (3,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), etc.\n\nSo we can navigate there.\n\nBut we need to think 5 turns ahead.\n\nSince we eat on turn 70, and it's positive food, we get +1 and grow.\n\nIf we delay, we might miss it or risk something else, but there is only one food.\n\nAlso, negative food not here.\n\nSo probably best to eat it soon.\n\nBut on turn 68, moving D to (5,2) seems direct.\n\nBut let's see if there is a risk.\n\nAnother thing: after moving to (5,2), on turn 69, if we move L to (4,2), fine.\n\nBut what if on turn 69, we cannot move L? No, we can.\n\nIn the move to (5,2), direction is D, so on turn 69, from (5,2), we can move L to (4,2) since not opposite.\n\nThen to (3,2).\n\nNow, the tail reward danger: when we eat at (3,2), is head adjacent to tail?\n\nAt that moment, on turn 70, before eating, head is at (4,2), moving to (3,2).\n\nTail is at (6,1), as in earlier calculation.\n\n(3,2) and (6,1) are not adjacent; (3,2) to (6,1) is delta x=3, delta y=-1, not adjacent.\n\nAnd the food is at (3,2), not on tail cell.\n\nTail cell is (6,1), no food.\n\nSo no danger.\n\nAfter eating, tail is still (6,1), and head at (3,2), not adjacent.\n\nSo safe.\n\nNow, what about other moves?\n\nSuppose on turn 68, we move U to (5,4).\n\nThen head at (5,4), direction U.\n\nThen on next turns, we need to go to (3,2), but it's farther.\n\nFor example, from (5,4), can go U to (5,5), or L to (4,4) but (4,4) is body, occupied, cannot, or R to (6,4), or D to (5,3) but opposite, cannot.\n\nSo possible U to (5,5) or R to (6,4).\n\nSay go to (5,5), then from there, U not possible y=6, but (5,6) is free? y=6, (5,6) not wall, but internal obstacle only (4,6), so (5,6) free.\n\nBut then we are going away.\n\nTo reach (3,2), need to go down and left, but with body in the way.\n\nFor instance, from (5,5) can go to (4,5) but (4,5) occupied, or (5,4) but body or opposite, (6,5) free, etc.\n\nIt might take more turns, and by turn 73, we might not reach.\n\nLife span: if we start from (5,4) on turn 68, to (3,2), minimum moves: need to decrease x by 2, y by 2, so at least 4 moves, but with obstacles, more.\n\nFor example, (5,4) to (4,4) occupied, cannot, so need to go around, say to (5,5) or (6,4), then to (6,3) or something, but (6,3) might be free later.\n\nBut after turn 68 move to (5,4), positions change.\n\nAt turn 68, after move U to (5,4): head (5,4), body (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) tail? Earlier: after move U, new positions: head (5,4), then (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) — tail (6,2).\n\nThen from (5,4), move U to (5,5) on turn 69, say.\n\nThen head to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut to get to (3,2), need to go to (4,4) but occupied, so must go through (4,3) or (5,3) but occupied, or via (3,3) or (2,2).\n\n(3,3) free, but from (5,5) to (3,3) is possible, but then to (3,2).\n\nBut (3,2) might be eaten by someone else? No, only one snake.\n\nBut it takes time: from (5,5) to (3,3) is left 2, down 2, at least 4 moves, then to (3,2) down, so 5 moves from (5,5).\n\nFrom turn 68 to turn 73 is 5 turns: t68, t69, t70, t71, t72, t73 — 6 turns including t68.\n\nt68 to t73: 68,69,70,71,72,73 — 6 actions.\n\nBut we are at t68, after action.\n\nIf on t68 we are at (5,4), then on t69 at (5,5), say.\n\nThen on t70 to (5,6) or (4,5) occupied, or (6,5), say to (6,5).\n\nThen on t71 to (6,4) or (5,5) occupied, or (6,6), say to (6,4).\n\nThen on t72 to (6,3) or (5,4) but (5,4) might be occupied? At that time, positions change.\n\nBut (6,3) might be free.\n\nThen from (6,3) to (3,2): need to go left to (5,3) but (5,3) body, or (4,3) body, cannot directly; must go down to (6,2) if possible, but (6,2) might be tail or something.\n\nComplicated, and risky if we get cornered.\n\nWhereas going directly to eat on t70 is safer and gets the score.\n\nMoreover, after eating, we have more space to move in the top area.\n\nSo probably best to eat soon.\n\nNow, back to turn 68 actions.\n\nWe can also consider moving R to (6,3) but that seems worse.\n\nOr, another idea: on turn 68, move D to (5,2), then on turn 69, instead of moving L immediately, we could move R to (6,2) tail, but that might not help.\n\nFor example, move D to (5,2) on t68.\n\nThen on t69, move R to (6,2), which is tail, so ok.\n\nThen head to (6,2), and since no food, tail moves, new positions: head (6,2), body (5,2), (5,3), etc., tail removed.\n\nBut then we are at (6,2), and food at (3,2) still far, and we lost a turn.\n\nThen need to go left, but (5,2) is now body, so cannot go back, must go up or down, but (6,1) occupied, (6,3) might be free.\n\nBut then takes more moves to reach (3,2).\n\nNot efficient.\n\nSo best to go directly towards food.\n\nTherefore, on turn 68, move D to (5,2).\n\nThen on turn 69, move L to (4,2).\n\nThen on turn 70, move L to (3,2) to eat.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the instruction is to output from turn t1 to some future, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and answer format is actions for several turns.\n\nAnswer format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ... }\n\nBut how many turns? It doesn't specify, but since we think ahead, probably until we eat or something.\n\nBut in this case, we can plan until we eat.\n\nSo for turn 68: D\n\nTurn 69: L\n\nTurn 70: L to eat.\n\nBut after that, we need to continue, but the answer might just be for a few turns.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", output at least 5 turns of actions.\n\nTurn 68 to 72, for example.\n\nAfter eating on turn 70, we need to move on.\n\nSo let's plan.\n\nTurn 68: move D to (5,2)\n\nTurn 69: move L to (4,2)\n\nTurn 70: move L to (3,2) eat\n\nNow turn 71: head at (3,2), direction L (since moved left to here)\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,3), L to (2,2), D to (3,1) but (3,1) is body, cannot, R to (4,2) but opposite and body, cannot.\n\nSo only U or L.\n\nU to (3,3) or L to (2,2).\n\nBoth free.\n\nSay, move U to (3,3) for example.\n\nThen turn 72: from (3,3), direction U (if moved up).\n\nThen can move U to (3,4), D to (3,2) but opposite, cannot, L to (2,3), R to (4,3) but (4,3) is body, occupied.\n\n(4,3) is body, yes.\n\nSo possible U to (3,4) or L to (2,3).\n\n(3,4) free, (2,3) free.\n\nSay move to (3,4).\n\nThen and so on.\n\nBut we don't need to specify forever, just for a few turns.\n\nSince the food is eaten on turn 70, and we survive, that's the main point.\n\nTo be complete, for 5 turns: turn 68 to 72.\n\nActions: t68: D, t69: L, t70: L, t71: U, t72: U for example.\n\nBut let's confirm.\n\nIn the sequence, on t70 we eat, so we have the score.\n\nIf we output only three turns, it might be fine, but since it says think 5+ turns, output 5 actions.\n\nTurn 68,69,70,71,72.\n\nt71 and t72 can be chosen arbitrarily as long as safe.\n\nIn t71, from (3,2), we can go L to (2,2) instead, but similar.\n\n(2,2) is free, then from there can go to (2,3), etc.\n\nBut U to (3,3) might be better to go to open area.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNo immediate danger.\n\nSo I think D on t68 is best.\n\nBut earlier I thought about the direction.\n\nAnother thing: when we move to (5,2) on t68, is there a risk of collision later?\n\nFor example, after moving, positions have head at (5,2), body (5,3), which is above, so if we go left to (4,2), fine.\n\nIf we go up later, but we go left.\n\nSeems fine.\n\nIf we move R to (6,3) on t68, then we might not eat the food in time.\n\nSimilarly for U.\n\nTherefore, I think move D on turn 68.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\nTurn 68: D\n\nTurn 69: L (to (4,2))\n\nTurn 70: L (to (3,2) eat)\n\nThen for turn 71: from (3,2), move U to (3,3)\n\nTurn 72: from (3,3), move U to (3,4)\n\nOr L to (2,3), but U to (3,4) is fine.\n\n(3,4) free.\n\nThen turn 73, etc., but we stop at turn 72 for 5 actions.\n\nt68, t69, t70, t71, t72 — that's 5 turns.\n\nActions: D, L, L, U, U\n\nBut need to specify the direction.\n\nIn answer format, it should be like \"D (down)\" etc., but in the box, probably just the letter.\n\nAnswer format: \"action \\in {U (up), D (down), L (left), R (right)}\"\n\nSo in the box, we can write \"U\" or \"D\" etc.\n\nAlso, with turn numbers.\n\nNow, but in turn 72, moving to (3,4), is it safe? Yes.\n\nTo avoid potential issues, but I think it's ok.\n\nSince we have to think ahead, and we did.\n\nSo for the output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 68: D\nTurn 69: L\nTurn 70: L\nTurn 71: U\nTurn 72: U\n}\n\nBut turn 71 and 72 are after eating, just for continuation.\n\nWe could output only until eat, but since 5+ turns, better to have 5 actions.\n\nPerhaps from t68 to t72 inclusive.\n\nt68 to t72 is 5 actions.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the sequence, on t70 we eat, which is good.\n\nIf we start with other moves, it might be worse.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating the positive food at (3,2) while ensuring long-term survival, a sequence of moves is planned over 5 turns (from turn 68 to turn 72). The food at (3,2) has a life span of 6 at turn 68, meaning it will disappear after turn 73. The plan prioritizes reaching and eating this food by turn 70, which is within the life span, while avoiding collisions with walls, obstacles, or the snake's body.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Current State (Turn 68)**:\n  - Snake head at (5,3) with direction right (R).\n  - Possible moves: Up (U) to (5,4), Down (D) to (5,2), Right (R) to (6,3). Left (L) is invalid due to \"no instant reverse\" rule.\n  - Food at (3,2) is positive (+1 reward, length +1) and must be eaten by turn 73.\n  - Moving Down (D) to (5,2) is safe (current tail position) and brings the snake closer to the food. Moving Right (R) or Up (U) leads away from the food, risking that it cannot be reached within the life span due to the snake's length and body obstacles.\n\n- **Path to Food**:\n  - From (5,2), moving Left (L) to (4,2) is safe and free.\n  - From (4,2), moving Left (L) to (3,2) eats the food on turn 70 (life span 4 at turn 70, still valid).\n  - Eating on turn 70 ensures the score increase and length growth without immediate danger (head not adjacent to tail during eating, and no tail reward risk).\n\n- **Post-Eating Survival**:\n  - After eating at (3,2) on turn 70, the head is at (3,2) with direction left (L).\n  - Possible moves: Up (U) to (3,3) or Left (L) to (2,2), both free. Up (U) is chosen to navigate toward open areas (e.g., (3,4), (2,3)) for future flexibility.\n  - Continuing Up (U) to (3,4) on turn 72 maintains safety and explores less congested regions.\n\n- **5-Turn Lookahead**:\n  - **Turn 68**: Move Down (D) to (5,2) – safe, moves toward food.\n  - **Turn 69**: Move Left (L) to (4,2) – safe, continues path to food.\n  - **Turn 70**: Move Left (L) to (3,2) – eats food (+1 score, length increases to 19), safe.\n  - **Turn 71**: Move Up (U) to (3,3) – safe, avoids body collisions, heads to open area.\n  - **Turn 72**: Move Up (U) to (3,4) – safe, continues into open space for future movement.\n\nThis sequence ensures the food is eaten efficiently, adds +1 to the score, and positions the snake in a less constrained area for subsequent turns, prioritizing long-term survival over immediate risks.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 68: D \\\\\nTurn 69: L \\\\\nTurn 70: L \\\\\nTurn 71: U \\\\\nTurn 72: U\n}",

        "step": 69,
        "score": 17,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 69. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7), but the borders are walls, meaning I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (5,2), and it's moving down (D). The full snake body is: [(5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)]. That's 18 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n\nFood: Only one food mentioned: at (3,2) with value 1 and life span 5. Since it's turn 69, and life span 5, it will disappear after turn 73 (69 + 5 - 1? Let me check the life span rule.\n\nLife span: Disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn 69, life span is 5, meaning it has 5 turns left including this one. So it will disappear after turn 73? Let's clarify:\n\n- Turn 69: life span 5, so after this turn, life span becomes 4.\n\n- Turn 70: life span 3\n\n- Turn 71: life span 2\n\n- Turn 72: life span 1\n\n- Turn 73: life span 0, disappears before or after? The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", and countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nIt says: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nI think it means that at the start of turn t, if life span is L, it decreases to L-1 during the turn, and if it reaches 0, it disappears at the end of the turn or something. But for simplicity, since we're making moves, we should consider that food with life span L on turn t will be gone by turn t + L.\n\nStandard interpretation: if life span is N at turn t, it has N turns left, so it can be eaten on turns t to t+N-1, and disappears at turn t+N.\n\nFor example, on turn 69, life span 5, so it can be eaten on turns 69,70,71,72,73? No.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" – I think \"after\" means after N turns have passed.\n\nSo, if food spawns at turn S with life span N, it disappears at turn S + N.\n\nHere, it's given at turn 69 with life span 5, so it spawned at some earlier turn? No, the state gives the current food positions with their current life span.\n\nThe input is: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span\" for the current turn.\n\nSo at turn 69, we have food at (3,2) with value 1 and life span 5. That means it has 5 turns left including turn 69. So:\n\n- After turn 69, life span decreases to 4\n\n- After turn 70, to 3\n\n- After turn 71, to 2\n\n- After turn 72, to 1\n\n- After turn 73, to 0, and it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 69 to turn 73 inclusive? Turn 73 is the last turn it can be eaten, since after that it disappears.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" might be ambiguous. Let's read carefully.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nAnd \"after N turns\" likely means after N turns from now, it disappears.\n\nSo at turn t, life span N, it disappears at turn t + N.\n\nBut countdown decreases every turn including current, so on turn t, it has countdown N, then after the turn, it becomes N-1, and so on, until it becomes 0 and disappears.\n\nFor eating, the food is available as long as countdown > 0.\n\nSo on turn t with countdown C, it can be eaten on that turn, and after eating or after the turn, countdown decreases.\n\nIn this case, at turn 69, countdown=5, so it can be eaten on turns 69,70,71,72,73? Let's see:\n\n- Start of turn 69: countdown=5, food present.\n\n- After turn 69, if not eaten, countdown=4.\n\n- Similarly, after turn 72, countdown=1, then after turn 73, countdown=0, food disappears.\n\nSo food is present and can be eaten on turns when countdown >=1, i.e., turns 69 to 73 inclusive. After turn 73, it's gone.\n\nTurn 73: at start, countdown=1, so it can be eaten, then after, countdown=0, disappears.\n\nYes.\n\nBut for planning, since we're thinking multiple turns ahead, we need to consider that.\n\nNow, back to the snake.\n\nHead at (5,2), direction down (D). So moving down means increasing y? Let's confirm coordinates.\n\nTypically in grids, y increases up or down? The movement: U (x,y+1) – so U is up, increasing y, D is down, decreasing y? No.\n\nMovement definitions:\n\nU: (x, y+1) – so if y+1, that means y increases upwards, like Cartesian coordinates with origin bottom-left? Or top-left?\n\nIt says: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y)\n\nAnd walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Since D is (x,y-1), that means y decreases downwards, so y=0 is the bottom row, y=7 is the top row? Let's see.\n\nFor example, snake head at (5,2), moving D (down) to (5,1)? But in positions, we have (5,2) then (5,3), which is above if y increases upwards.\n\nSnake positions: head (5,2), next is (5,3). Since the body follows, (5,3) is the segment behind the head. Head is moving down to (5,2) from previous? Direction is given as current head direction.\n\nCurrent head direction is D (down). But from positions, head is at (5,2), and the next segment is (5,3). If head is at (5,2) and moving down, which is (x,y-1), so to (5,1). But the previous position before (5,2) must have been (5,1) or something.\n\nLet's list the positions in order: index 0: (5,2) head, index 1: (5,3), index 2: (4,3), etc.\n\nSo from head to tail: (5,2) -> (5,3) -> (4,3) -> (4,4) -> (4,5) -> (3,5) -> (2,5) -> (1,5) -> (1,4) -> (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (5,1) -> (6,1) -> (6,2) tail.\n\nNow, head is at (5,2), and direction is D, down, which is (x,y-1). But the previous position is (5,3), which is directly above, since y=3 > y=2, so y increases upwards. So (5,3) is north of (5,2).\n\nTherefore, moving down decreases y, moving up increases y.\n\nHead direction D means it came from (5,3) to (5,2), so moving down.\n\nNow, possible moves from (5,2) with direction D.\n\nCannot move opposite, so cannot move up (U), because that would be reverse.\n\nOpposite of down is up, so cannot move U.\n\nPossible moves: D (down), L (left), R (right).\n\nD: to (5,1)\n\nL: to (4,2)\n\nR: to (6,2)\n\nNow, check for collisions.\n\nFirst, walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So (5,1): x=5, y=1, y=1 is not 0, so not border wall. y=0 is bottom wall, y=1 is above it.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) and (6,2) are within bounds.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), not relevant here.\n\nNow, snake body: positions are all occupied except the tail might move.\n\nWhen moving, the head moves to new position, then the body follows, so the tail cell is vacated unless the snake eats food and grows.\n\nFor collision, head cannot move to a cell occupied by any body segment except the tail, because the tail will move away.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, if head moves to a cell that will be occupied by a body segment after the move, it collides, except if that cell is the current tail and no food is eaten, then it's ok because the tail moves.\n\nSpecifically, after moving, the head is at new position, and all body segments shift forward, so the old tail is removed.\n\nSo, if head moves to a cell that is not the current tail, and that cell has a body segment, collision.\n\nIf it moves to the current tail cell, and no food eaten, then ok, since tail moves away.\n\nIf food is eaten, the tail doesn't move, so if head moves to tail cell and eats food, it would collide because the tail stays, but in this case, food at tail might be special.\n\nBut for now, let's list the current body positions.\n\nSnake positions: all cells except head and tail: (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), and tail (6,2).\n\nHead is (5,2), so (5,1) is a body segment? (5,1) is in the list, index 15: (5,1), which is not tail.\n\nTail is (6,2).\n\nSo cells occupied: (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nAnd head at (5,2), but we're moving from there.\n\nNow, possible moves from (5,2):\n\n- D: to (5,1). But (5,1) is occupied by body segment (5,1), which is not the tail (tail is (6,2)), so moving to (5,1) would cause collision with body.\n\n- L: to (4,2). Is (4,2) occupied? Looking at positions: (4,3), (4,4), etc., not (4,2). So (4,2) is empty? Let's list all positions to see if (4,2) is there.\n\nPositions: (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nSo (4,2) is not in the list, so it should be free, no body.\n\n- R: to (6,2). (6,2) is the current tail position. Since we're moving to it, and if no food eaten, it should be ok because the tail will move away.\n\nBut is there food at (6,2)? Food is at (3,2), not (6,2). So no food there, so moving to (6,2) is safe; head moves to (6,2), tail was at (6,2) but moves, so no collision.\n\nAlso, walls: (4,2) and (6,2) are within bounds, not walls.\n\nNow, D to (5,1) is occupied by body, so not possible.\n\nSo possible actions: L to (4,2) or R to (6,2). Or D? D is to (5,1) which is occupied, so invalid.\n\nBut what about U? U is opposite to current direction D, so cannot move U, as per no instant reverse.\n\nSo only L or R possible.\n\nNow, food is at (3,2) with value +1.\n\n(3,2) is adjacent to head? Head at (5,2), (3,2) is two steps left? (5,2) to (4,2) to (3,2), so not adjacent.\n\nAdjacent means one step: up, down, left, right.\n\nFrom (5,2), adjacent cells: (5,3) up, but that's body; (5,1) down, body; (4,2) left; (6,2) right.\n\nFood at (3,2) is not adjacent; it's left of (4,2).\n\nSo to eat it, need to go to (4,2) first or something.\n\nNow, life span: 5 turns left, including turn 69, so can be eaten until turn 73.\n\nBut we need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nFirst, I need to plan multiple moves.\n\nAlso, the goal is to maximize score, but prioritize long-term survival.\n\nCurrently, only one food, positive at (3,2).\n\nBut there might be risks.\n\nFirst, let's see the grid layout.\n\nGrid: 8x8, x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so cannot go there.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake is long, 18 segments.\n\nHead at (5,2), tail at (6,2).\n\nFood at (3,2).\n\nNow, from current position, possible moves: L to (4,2) or R to (6,2).\n\nIf I go L to (4,2), then head at (4,2), direction changes to L.\n\nThen from there, I can consider going to (3,2) to eat food, but (3,2) might have something.\n\nIs (3,2) occupied? Snake positions: we have (3,5), (2,5), etc., but not (3,2). Also, (1,2), (2,1), but no (3,2). So (3,2) should be free except for food.\n\nFood is at (3,2), so if head moves to (3,2), it eats the food.\n\nBut we need to check if it's safe.\n\nFirst, from (4,2), if I move to (3,2), that would be left again.\n\nBut let's think step by step.\n\nTurn 69: action.\n\nOption 1: Move L to (4,2)\n\nAfter move: head moves to (4,2), body shifts: new positions: head (4,2), then previous head (5,2) becomes body, so segment 1: (5,2), then (5,3), (4,3), ..., up to tail (6,1)? Let's list new positions after move.\n\nCurrent positions before move: [ (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) ]\n\nAfter moving head to (4,2):\n\n- Head new: (4,2)\n\n- Then body: the first body segment moves to previous head position (5,2), so (5,2) becomes segment 1.\n\nThen segment 2 moves to previous segment 1 position (5,3), and so on.\n\nAfter move:\n\n- Head: (4,2)\n\n- Segment 1: (5,2)  // previous head\n\n- Segment 2: (5,3)  // previous segment 1\n\n- Segment 3: (4,3)  // previous segment 2\n\n- Segment 4: (4,4)  // previous segment 3\n\n- Segment 5: (4,5)  // previous segment 4\n\n- Segment 6: (3,5)  // previous segment 5\n\n- And so on, down to segment 17: (6,1)  // previous segment 16? Let's index.\n\nPrevious positions: index 0: (5,2) head, 1: (5,3), 2: (4,3), 3: (4,4), 4: (4,5), 5: (3,5), 6: (2,5), 7: (1,5), 8: (1,4), 9: (1,3), 10: (1,2), 11: (1,1), 12: (2,1), 13: (3,1), 14: (4,1), 15: (5,1), 16: (6,1), 17: (6,2) tail\n\nAfter move L to (4,2):\n\n- New head: (4,2)\n\n- New segment 1: old head (5,2)\n\n- New segment 2: old segment 1 (5,3)\n\n- New segment 3: old segment 2 (4,3)\n\n- New segment 4: old segment 3 (4,4)\n\n- New segment 5: old segment 4 (4,5)\n\n- New segment 6: old segment 5 (3,5)\n\n- ... up to new segment 17: old segment 16 (6,1)\n\n- New tail: old segment 17 (6,2) is gone? The tail moves: since no food eaten, the last segment is removed.\n\nSo new positions: head (4,2), then (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\nTail is (6,1), which was previously segment 16.\n\nOld segment 17 (6,2) is no longer part of snake.\n\nSo snake now: [(4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)]\n\nLength 18, same.\n\nHead direction: moved left, so now direction L.\n\nFood: still at (3,2) with life span now 4? After turn 69, if not eaten, life span decreases to 4 for turn 70.\n\nBut in this move, we didn't eat, so food remains.\n\nOption 2: Move R to (6,2)\n\nHead to (6,2), which is current tail.\n\nAfter move: head (6,2), then body: (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), ..., (6,1), and tail (6,2) is vacated, so new tail is old segment 16 or something.\n\nCurrent positions same.\n\nAfter move R to (6,2):\n\n- Head: (6,2)\n\n- Segment 1: old head (5,2)\n\n- Segment 2: old segment 1 (5,3)\n\n- ...\n- Segment 17: old segment 16 (6,1)  // since old segment 17 was (6,2), which is now head, so the last body is old segment 16 (6,1)\n\nNew positions: head (6,2), then (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\nTail (6,1)\n\nDirection now R.\n\nNo food eaten.\n\nNow, back to choice.\n\nIf I go left to (4,2), I can then go to (3,2) to eat food on next turn.\n\nIf I go right to (6,2), I'm moving away from food.\n\nBut there might be risks or other considerations.\n\nFirst, let's think about the area.\n\nThe snake is coiled in the bottom-left, with head at (5,2), and the body goes up to (5,3), then left to (4,3), up to (4,4), up to (4,5), then left to (3,5), etc., down to (1,5), then down to (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), then right to (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), then up to (6,2) tail.\n\nFrom (6,1) to (6,2), so tail at (6,2).\n\nNow, the food is at (3,2), which is near the body.\n\nSpecifically, (3,2) is adjacent to (3,1), (3,3)? (3,3) not occupied, (3,1) is occupied.\n\n(3,1) is a body segment.\n\nIf I go to (4,2) on turn 69, then on turn 70 I can go to (3,2) to eat.\n\nBut when I move to (3,2), I eat the food, so the snake grows, tail doesn't move.\n\nNow, is there any danger?\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger\": If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut here, food is at (3,2), not at tail.\n\nTail is at (6,1) or wherever, not near.\n\nSo eating (3,2) should be fine.\n\nBut after eating, the snake grows, so it becomes longer.\n\nNow, possible issue: after eating at (3,2), the head is at (3,2), and the body includes (4,2), (5,2), etc.\n\nBut let's simulate.\n\nFirst, I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (4,6) might be relevant later.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on getting the food.\n\nIf I don't go for food now, I might miss it since life span is 5, but I can get it later.\n\nBut going right to (6,2) might lead to dead end or something.\n\nLet's see the available space.\n\nGrid: top row y=7, bottom y=0.\n\nSnake occupies many cells, but not all.\n\nFor example, area around (6,2) to (7,2), but x=7 is wall, so (6,2) is at right edge.\n\nFrom (6,2), possible moves: since direction is R, cannot move L (opposite).\n\nCurrent direction after move: if I went R, direction is R, so can move U, D, R (but R to (7,2) is x=7, wall, so invalid).\n\nD to (6,1), but (6,1) is body? After moving to (6,2), positions: head (6,2), body (5,2), (5,3), ..., (6,1) is tail? After move to (6,2), tail is at (6,1), so (6,1) is occupied by tail.\n\nFrom (6,2), possible moves:\n\n- U to (6,3): is it free? Current positions after move: (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), etc. (6,3) not occupied, so free.\n\n- D to (6,1): (6,1) is the current tail, and no food there, so moving to (6,1) is safe because tail will move away.\n\n- R to (7,2): x=7 is wall, invalid.\n\n- L to (5,2): but L is opposite to current direction R? After moving R, direction is R, so opposite is L, cannot move L.\n\nSo possible: U to (6,3) or D to (6,1).\n\nIf U to (6,3), then can go up.\n\nIf D to (6,1), then to (6,1), which was tail, but after move, it becomes body, and tail moves.\n\nBut (6,1) is low y, near bottom.\n\ny=1, bottom is y=0 wall.\n\nNot much space there.\n\nIf I go left to (4,2) on turn 69, then on turn 70 I can go to (3,2) to eat food.\n\nTurn 70: from (4,2), direction L, so can move U, D, L (to (3,2)).\n\nL to (3,2): to eat food.\n\nThen, after eating, snake grows, so positions: head to (3,2), food eaten, so tail doesn't move.\n\nNew positions: head (3,2), then body: previous head (4,2), then (5,2), (5,3), etc., up to tail (6,1), and since ate, add new segment at end, so tail remains (6,1)? No.\n\nAfter eating, the tail doesn't move, so the new tail is the old tail.\n\nCurrent positions before turn 70 move: after turn 69 move L to (4,2), positions: [(4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)]\n\nTail at (6,1).\n\nNow turn 70, move L to (3,2): head to (3,2), which has food, so eat it, value +1, snake grows.\n\nThen new positions: head (3,2), then previous head (4,2) becomes segment 1, and so on, but tail doesn't move, so the last segment stays.\n\nSo positions: head (3,2), segment 1: (4,2), segment 2: (5,2), segment 3: (5,3), segment 4: (4,3), ..., up to segment 17: (5,1)? Let's count.\n\nPrevious positions had 18 segments.\n\nAfter move and eat: head new (3,2), then the existing body: (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\nBut since ate, we add a new segment, so the snake grows to 19 segments.\n\nNew tail is (6,1), same as before, but now it's part of the body, and since no move, it stays.\n\nPositions: head (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\nYes, 19 positions.\n\nNow, head at (3,2), direction L.\n\nFood eaten, so no food now, or other food might spawn, but currently only one, so no food.\n\nLife span decreases, but food gone.\n\nNow, after that, I need to survive and find more food, but no other food mentioned, so probably only this one for now.\n\nBut the state has only this food, so we need to consider that.\n\nNow, from (3,2), possible moves.\n\nDirection L, so cannot move R (opposite).\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,3), D to (3,1), L to (2,2).\n\nNow, check cells:\n\n(3,3): is it free? Positions: (3,5), (2,5), etc., not (3,3), so free.\n\n(3,1): is occupied, body segment (3,1) in the list.\n\n(2,2): not in positions, so free.\n\nSo can move U, D, or L.\n\nBut D to (3,1) is occupied by body, so invalid.\n\nSo can move U to (3,3) or L to (2,2).\n\nIf U to (3,3), then can go up.\n\nIf L to (2,2), then left.\n\nNow, the area above might have space, or left.\n\nBut there is an internal obstacle at (4,6), but not relevant yet.\n\nNow, if on turn 69 I go right to (6,2), then I'm on the right side.\n\nAfter turn 69 move R to (6,2): positions: [(6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)]\n\nTail at (6,1).\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 70, from (6,2), possible moves: U to (6,3), D to (6,1) (tail, safe), or R to (7,2) invalid, L to (5,2) but L opposite, invalid.\n\nSo U or D.\n\nIf U to (6,3), then to (6,3), which is free.\n\nThen can continue up.\n\nBut food at (3,2) is far, and with life span decreasing, if I don't go soon, I might not get it.\n\nLife span 5, turn 69 to 73.\n\nIf I go right on turn 69, on turn 70 I can go U to (6,3), then on turn 71 to (6,4), etc., but (3,2) is at left bottom, so I need to turn back, but snake is long, might be trapped.\n\nFor example, from (6,3), I can go left to (5,3), but (5,3) is body? After positions, (5,3) is occupied.\n\nAfter turn 69 move R, positions: head (6,2), body (5,2), (5,3), etc.\n\nSo (5,3) is occupied.\n\nFrom (6,3) if I go there on turn 70, then positions: head (6,3), body (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), etc.\n\nSo (5,3) occupied, (6,2) occupied, etc.\n\nTo go left, I need to go to (5,3) but it's occupied, so I have to go up or down or right, but right wall.\n\nFrom (6,3), can go U to (6,4), D to (6,2) but (6,2) occupied, L to (5,3) occupied, R invalid.\n\nSo only U to (6,4) possible? D to (6,2) is occupied, so invalid unless tail, but not.\n\n(6,2) is body segment, not tail, so moving to (6,2) would collide.\n\nSimilarly, L to (5,3) is body, collide.\n\nR invalid.\n\nSo only U to (6,4) if free.\n\n(6,4) not occupied, so yes.\n\nThen similarly, up to (6,5), (6,6), but y=7 wall, so limited.\n\nThen I might get stuck.\n\nIf from (6,2) on turn 70 I go D to (6,1), which is tail, safe.\n\nThen to (6,1), but y=1, near bottom wall, and left is occupied.\n\nFrom (6,1), after move, head at (6,1), direction D.\n\nThen can move L to (5,1), but (5,1) is body; U to (6,2), but (6,2) is body; D to (6,0) invalid wall; R invalid.\n\nAll invalid except U to (6,2) but occupied, so dead end.\n\nIf on turn 70 from (6,2) I go D to (6,1), which is tail, so move to (6,1).\n\nAfter move: head to (6,1), tail was (6,1) but moves, new positions: head (6,1), then (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), etc., tail (6,1) gone, new tail (5,1)? Previous positions before move: head (6,2), body (5,2), (5,3), ..., (6,1) tail.\n\nAfter move D to (6,1): head (6,1), then previous head (6,2), then (5,2), (5,3), ..., up to (4,1) or something, and old tail (6,1) is head now, so last body is previous segment 16, (5,1)? Previous segments: (5,2) is segment 1, (5,3) seg2, ..., (5,1) is not in the body after turn 69.\n\nAfter turn 69 move R: positions: (6,2) head, (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) tail\n\nSo (5,1) is segment 15? Index: head (6,2), seg1 (5,2), seg2 (5,3), seg3 (4,3), seg4 (4,4), seg5 (4,5), seg6 (3,5), ..., seg15 (5,1)? Let's list:\n\nPositions: 0: (6,2) head, 1: (5,2), 2: (5,3), 3: (4,3), 4: (4,4), 5: (4,5), 6: (3,5), 7: (2,5), 8: (1,5), 9: (1,4), 10: (1,3), 11: (1,2), 12: (1,1), 13: (2,1), 14: (3,1), 15: (4,1), 16: (5,1), 17: (6,1) tail\n\nAfter move D to (6,1): head to (6,1), which was tail, so new head (6,1), then seg1: old head (6,2), seg2: old seg1 (5,2), seg3: old seg2 (5,3), ..., up to seg17: old seg16 (5,1)? Old seg16 is (5,1), old seg17 tail (6,1) is now head, so the new body is from old seg1 to old seg16.\n\nNew positions: head (6,1), then (6,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)\n\nTail (5,1)\n\nNow, from (6,1), head, direction D (since moved down).\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,2): (6,2) is now body segment, occupied, so invalid.\n\nD to (6,0): y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nL to (5,1): (5,1) is tail, so can move to it if no food.\n\nR to (7,1): x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo can move L to (5,1) since tail.\n\nThen to (5,1), which was tail.\n\nThen similarly, might be able to go to (4,1) or something, but (4,1) is body.\n\nAfter moving to (5,1), positions shift, and so on.\n\nBut it's getting messy, and I'm moving into a tight space with the snake body.\n\nWhereas if I go left to (4,2) on turn 69, I can eat the food on turn 70, then I have more options from (3,2).\n\nMoreover, by eating, I grow, which might be good for score, but I need to survive.\n\nBut in this case, after eating at (3,2), head at (3,2), I can go U to (3,3) or L to (2,2), both free.\n\nFor example, go U to (3,3), then to (3,4), etc., towards the center or up.\n\nThere is space above.\n\nThe internal obstacle at (4,6) is at top, but not blocking immediately.\n\nAlso, the snake body is mostly in bottom-left, so moving up should be ok.\n\nIf I go right, I risk getting trapped in the right-bottom corner.\n\nTherefore, it's better to go left on turn 69 to (4,2), then on turn 70 go to (3,2) to eat food.\n\nThen on subsequent turns, move to open space.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to specify actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nTurn 69: move L to (4,2)\n\nTurn 70: move L to (3,2) to eat food.\n\nThen turn 71: from (3,2), direction L, can move U or L (since D is occupied, R opposite).\n\nAfter turn 70, head at (3,2), direction L.\n\nPositions: as above, head (3,2), body: (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\n(3,1) is occupied.\n\nPossible moves from (3,2):\n\n- U to (3,3): free\n\n- D to (3,1): occupied, invalid\n\n- L to (2,2): free\n\n- R to (4,2): but R is opposite to current direction L, so cannot move R.\n\nSo possible: U or L.\n\nNow, to survive, I should go to open area. (3,3) is above, or (2,2) left.\n\n(2,2) might be near body, but free now.\n\n(3,3) is better to go up.\n\nSay move U to (3,3) on turn 71.\n\nThen direction U.\n\nThen turn 72: from (3,3), can move U to (3,4), D to (3,2) but (3,2) occupied, L to (2,3), R to (4,3) but (4,3) occupied.\n\n(4,3) is body.\n\n(3,2) is body.\n\n(2,3): free? Not occupied.\n\n(3,4): free.\n\nSo can move U to (3,4) or L to (2,3).\n\nSay U to (3,4).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut since the food is eaten, and no other food, I just need to avoid collisions and stay alive.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to specify actions for turn 69 to at least turn 73 or so.\n\nTurn 69,70,71,72,73,74.\n\nBut turn 73 is when food disappears if not eaten.\n\nIn this plan, I eat on turn 70.\n\nNow, to confirm, on turn 69, move L.\n\nBut is there any risk in going to (4,2)?\n\n(4,2) is adjacent to body? (4,3) is body, but (4,2) is not adjacent to head in a way that causes issue.\n\nFrom (5,2) to (4,2) is safe.\n\nSimilarly, moving to (3,2) to eat.\n\nBut (3,2) is adjacent to (3,1), which is body, but when I move to (3,2), head is there, and (3,1) is not the head, so no collision.\n\nAfter moving, positions ok.\n\nNow, the tail reward danger doesn't apply here.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nIf I go right, I might not get the food and get stuck.\n\nSo better to go left.\n\nTherefore, for turn 69: L\n\nThen turn 70: L to eat food.\n\nThen for future turns, I need to specify, but since no food, I can choose any safe move to explore.\n\nBut for the answer format, I need to provide actions for several turns.\n\nLet's plan 5 turns: turn 69 to 73.\n\nTurn 69: move L to (4,2)\n\nTurn 70: move L to (3,2) to eat food. After this, score increases, snake length 19.\n\nTurn 71: from (3,2), direction L. Possible moves: U to (3,3) or L to (2,2). I think U is better to go up. So move U.\n\nTurn 72: from (3,3), direction U. Possible moves: U to (3,4), D to (3,2) occupied, L to (2,3), R to (4,3) occupied. So U or L. Move U to (3,4).\n\nTurn 73: from (3,4), direction U. Possible moves: U to (3,5), but (3,5) is body? Positions: after turn 72, let's not simulate fully, but (3,5) might be occupied or not.\n\nAfter eating, positions include (3,5), which is body.\n\nFrom (3,4), move U to (3,5): (3,5) is occupied, so invalid.\n\nD to (3,3) occupied.\n\nL to (2,4), R to (4,4) but (4,4) occupied.\n\n(2,4) free? Probably.\n\n(4,4) occupied.\n\nSo possible: L to (2,4) or if R, but R to (4,4) occupied.\n\nSince direction U, can move L or R, but R to (4,4) invalid, so only L to (2,4) possible? Or U and D, but U and D invalid.\n\nMoves: from (3,4), dir U, can move U, D, L, R but not opposite, opposite is D? Current direction U, opposite is D, cannot move D.\n\nCan move U, L, R.\n\nU to (3,5): occupied, invalid.\n\nR to (4,4): occupied, invalid.\n\nL to (2,4): should be free.\n\nSo must move L to (2,4).\n\nThen to (2,4), and so on.\n\nBut I need to think about survival.\n\nIn this path, by turn 73, I might be at (2,4) or something.\n\nBut since I ate the food, and no immediate danger, it should be ok.\n\nIf on turn 71 I go L to (2,2) instead of U.\n\nBut U seems better to go to less occupied area.\n\n(3,3) and above might have space.\n\ny=5,6,7 but y=7 wall.\n\nAlso internal obstacle at (4,6), but not blocking.\n\nSo for the answer, I'll go with this plan.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 69: L\n\nTurn 70: L\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nTurn 72: U (to (3,4))\n\nOn turn 72 from (3,3) to (3,4), then turn 73 from (3,4) to (2,4) L.\n\nBut I need to specify for at least 5 turns.\n\nTurn 69 to 73.\n\nTurn 73: from (3,4) to (2,4) L.\n\nThen turn 74: from (2,4), direction L (since moved left), can move U, D, L (to (1,4)), R (to (3,4)) but (3,4) occupied now, etc.\n\nBut I think for the answer, since the food is secured, and we're surviving, it's fine.\n\nTo maximize score, I ate the positive food.\n\nNow, for the boxed answer.\n\nBut in the initial, on turn 69, I must choose action.\n\nAlso, the head direction is given as D, so after move L, direction changes.\n\nI think it's correct.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (3,2) could be under body? But in positions, (3,2) is not occupied, it has food, so it's free to move to.\n\nNot under body.\n\nIn this case, no issue.\n\nSo I think go left.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating the positive food at (3,2) while ensuring long-term survival, the strategy involves moving left on turn 69 to position the head for eating the food on turn 70. After eating, the snake grows, and subsequent moves focus on navigating to open areas to avoid collisions and maintain survival. The food has a life span of 5 at turn 69, meaning it disappears after turn 73, so eating it on turn 70 is efficient.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Current State (Turn 69)**:\n  - Head at (5,2), direction down (D).\n  - Possible moves: Left (L) to (4,2) or Right (R) to (6,2). Down (D) to (5,1) is invalid due to body collision, and Up (U) is invalid due to no instant reverse.\n  - Moving L to (4,2) allows access to the food at (3,2) on the next turn, while moving R to (6,2) risks trapping the snake in the bottom-right corner with limited escape routes.\n- **Food Timing**: Food at (3,2) has life span 5 at turn 69, so it can be eaten from turns 69 to 73. Eating on turn 70 avoids missing it and gains +1 score with length increase.\n- **Collision Risks**:\n  - After eating, the snake length increases to 19, so moves must avoid body segments and walls.\n  - The area around (3,2) has body segments (e.g., (3,1), (4,2)), but planned moves are safe.\n  - Internal obstacle at (4,6) is not immediately relevant but will be avoided in later moves.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: After eating, moves prioritize moving upward (increasing y) to less occupied areas (e.g., toward y=3-6) to explore space and avoid tight corners. No other food is present, so survival is key beyond turn 73.\n\n### Planned Moves (5+ Turns Ahead):\n- **Turn 69 (current)**: Move L to (4,2).  \n  - Reason: Positions head to eat food next turn. Direction changes to left (L). Safe, as (4,2) is unoccupied.\n- **Turn 70**: Move L to (3,2) to eat food.  \n  - Reason: Eats positive food (+1 score, length 19). Direction remains L. Safe, as (3,2) is food cell and not adjacent to tail with food (tail is at (6,1)).\n- **Turn 71**: Move U to (3,3).  \n  - Reason: From (3,2), direction L, so U is valid. Moves toward open space (y=3+). (3,3) is unoccupied. Direction changes to up (U).\n- **Turn 72**: Move U to (3,4).  \n  - Reason: From (3,3), direction U, so U is valid. Continues upward to less occupied area. (3,4) is unoccupied. Direction remains U.\n- **Turn 73**: Move L to (2,4).  \n  - Reason: From (3,4), direction U. U to (3,5) is invalid (body collision), R to (4,4) is invalid (body collision), so L to (2,4) is the only safe option. (2,4) is unoccupied. Direction changes to left (L).\n- **Turn 74**: Move U to (2,5) or L to (1,4) if possible, but since no food, prioritize safe exploration.  \n  - From (2,4), direction L, so U, D, or L are possible. U to (2,5) may be invalid if occupied (body at (2,5) in current state, but positions shift; check for occupancy later). L to (1,4) is likely safe. Detailed planning beyond 5 turns depends on new food spawns, but this path avoids immediate risks.\n\n### Why This Plan?\n- **Score Maximization**: Eats the only available positive food on turn 70, increasing score and length.\n- **Risk Avoidance**: \n  - Avoids right move (turn 69) which could trap the snake near walls/body.\n  - After eating, upward moves reduce collision risk by navigating away from dense body areas.\n- **Survival Focus**: Plans beyond turn 73 (when food expires) by moving to open grid areas (e.g., (2,4) or higher y), ensuring the snake has space to maneuver. With the long snake (18->19 segments), keeping to less occupied regions (e.g., center or top-left) is safer than bottom-right corners.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 69: L \\\\\nTurn 70: L \\\\\nTurn 71: U \\\\\nTurn 72: U \\\\\nTurn 73: L\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 70. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There's also an internal obstacle at (4,6). The snake is 18 segments long, starting from head at (4,2) and going through all those positions, ending at (6,1). The head direction is left, so it's moving left.\n\nThere are two food items:\n\n- At (3,2) with value 1 and life span 4. That means it disappears after 4 turns, including this one, so it will be gone by turn 74.\n\n- At (3,6) with value 1 and life span 10. It will disappear after turn 80.\n\nBoth foods have value +1, so they're positive food.\n\nI need to plan at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. The key is to prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid. It's 8x8? x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so yes, 8x8 grid.\n\nWalls: borders and (4,6) obstacle.\n\nSnake positions: head at (4,2), then (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). So the tail is at (6,1).\n\nHead direction is left, so from (4,2), moving left would be to (3,2), but (3,2) has food! Let's see.\n\n(3,2) is a food position. But is it under the snake? Snake positions: let's list all to avoid confusion.\n\nSnake segments:\n\n- Head: (4,2)\n\n- Next: (5,2) — so body segment\n\n- (5,3)\n\n- (4,3)\n\n- (4,4)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (3,5)\n\n- (2,5)\n\n- (1,5)\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (1,3)\n\n- (1,2)\n\n- (1,1)\n\n- (2,1)\n\n- (3,1)\n\n- (4,1)\n\n- (5,1)\n\n- Tail: (6,1)\n\nNow, food at (3,2) and (3,6).\n\n(3,2) is not in the snake positions above. Snake has (1,2), (2,1), etc., but not (3,2). Let's check: positions are (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). So (3,2) is not occupied by snake; it's empty with food.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) is not occupied; it has food.\n\nBut (3,2) has life span 4, so it will disappear soon.\n\nCurrent head position: (4,2), direction left, so moving left would go to (3,2), which has food.\n\nIf it moves to (3,2), it eats the food, since head moves onto it.\n\nBut there's a rule about tail reward danger. Is the head adjacent to the tail?\n\nTail is at (6,1). Head at (4,2). Distance: x from 4 to 6 is 2, y from 2 to 1 is 1, so not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up/down/left/right.\n\n(4,2) and (6,1) are not adjacent; they are two cells apart. Adjacent cells would be like (4,2) and (3,2) or (4,1) or (5,2) or (4,3). (5,2) is adjacent but it's a body segment, not tail.\n\nTail is (6,1), which is not adjacent to (4,2). So no issue with tail reward danger here.\n\nIf snake moves left to (3,2), it eats the food, length increases by 1, so a new segment will be added, but since it's moving, the tail moves away.\n\nNormally, when snake eats, it grows, so the tail doesn't move immediately; the new segment is added at the head position after moving.\n\nStandard snake mechanics: when head moves to a food, it eats, and the tail doesn't move that turn, so length increases.\n\nBut in this case, after eating, the snake grows, so positions extend.\n\nBut here, moving to (3,2) should be safe, I think.\n\nBut let's see possible moves.\n\nHead at (4,2), direction left, so possible moves: since direction is left, it can go left, up, or down, but not right because no instant reverse.\n\nCurrent direction left, so cannot go right immediately.\n\nPossible moves from (4,2):\n\n- Left to (3,2) — has food\n\n- Up to (4,3) — but (4,3) is occupied by snake body? Snake positions: (4,3) is a body segment, yes.\n\n(4,3) is the fourth segment: positions: index 0: (4,2) head, 1: (5,2), 2: (5,3), 3: (4,3), 4: (4,4), etc.\n\nSo (4,3) is occupied by the snake itself. If head moves there, it collides with body, death.\n\nSimilarly, down to (4,1) — (4,1) is also occupied by snake, it's the 15th segment or something. Positions: (4,1) is there, yes, occupied.\n\nSo from (4,2), possible moves:\n\n- Left to (3,2): free and has food\n\n- Up to (4,3): occupied by body, collision\n\n- Down to (4,1): occupied by body, collision\n\n- Right to (5,2): but (5,2) is the second segment, occupied, and also, instant reverse? Current direction is left, so moving right would be opposite direction, which is not allowed.\n\nNo instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. So from left, cannot go right.\n\nTherefore, only possible move is left to (3,2).\n\nIs that right? Let me confirm.\n\nCurrent head direction: L (left), so last move was left to (4,2)? Head is at (4,2), and direction is L, meaning it came from right, so moving left.\n\nSo from (4,2), moving left would be to (3,2).\n\nMoving up to (4,3): but (4,3) is occupied, and it's not opposite, but occupied.\n\nSimilarly down to (4,1): occupied.\n\nRight: opposite direction, not allowed.\n\nSo indeed, only possible move is left to (3,2).\n\nBut (3,2) has food, so it will eat it.\n\nThen, after eating, the snake grows: head moves to (3,2), and a new segment is added, so the tail doesn't move.\n\nCurrent positions: head to (3,2), then the body segments follow, but since it ate, the tail stays, so new positions: head (3,2), then previous head (4,2) becomes body, then (5,2), (5,3), etc., and tail (6,1) remains until next move.\n\nAfter move, head moves to new position. If food eaten, tail doesn't move, so length increases. If no food, tail moves.\n\nHere, moving to (3,2) has food, so after turn, head at (3,2), body includes (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), ..., all the way to (6,1), and since ate, tail stays, so positions become: [(3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)] — 19 segments now.\n\nBut (4,3) is still there, etc.\n\nNow, for the next turns, I need to plan.\n\nBut in this state, at turn 70, moving to (3,2) is the only possible move, right? Because other moves are blocked or invalid.\n\nBut let's double-check the grid.\n\nWalls: borders, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. But (4,2) is inside, x=4, y=2, not border.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), not relevant here.\n\nSo from (4,2), adjacent cells:\n\n- Left: (3,2) - not wall, not occupied except for food, but food can be eaten, so it's free.\n\n- Up: (4,3) - occupied by snake body\n\n- Down: (4,1) - occupied by snake body\n\n- Right: (5,2) - occupied by snake body, and also opposite direction.\n\nSo yes, only (3,2) is available.\n\nTherefore, on turn 70, the action must be L (left) to (3,2), eating the food.\n\nBut the food at (3,2) has life span 4, meaning it will disappear after 4 turns, including this one. Since we're eating it now, it's consumed, so no issue.\n\nNow, after this move, head is at (3,2), and direction is now L, since we moved left.\n\nDirection: after moving, the new direction is the direction we just moved, I assume. The state gives head direction, which is the current moving direction.\n\nAfter moving left to (3,2), head direction is left for the next move.\n\nNow, turn 71: head at (3,2), direction L.\n\nNow, possible moves from (3,2):\n\n- Left to (2,2): what is at (2,2)? Let's see if occupied or wall.\n\nSnake positions: after move, positions are: head (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\n(2,2) is not in this list; it should be free.\n\nWalls: borders, x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (2,2) is inside.\n\nInternal obstacle (4,6), not relevant.\n\nSo (2,2) should be free.\n\n- Up to (3,3): what is there? (3,3) not in positions, so free.\n\n- Down to (3,1): (3,1) is in positions, it's a body segment. Specifically, in the list, (3,1) is the 15th or so, occupied.\n\n- Right to (4,2): but (4,2) is now the second segment, occupied, and also, moving right would be opposite to current direction left? Current direction is left, so moving right is opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo possible moves:\n\n- Left to (2,2)\n\n- Up to (3,3)\n\n- Down to (3,1) but occupied, collision\n\n- Right: not allowed, opposite direction.\n\nSo only left to (2,2) or up to (3,3) are possible.\n\n(2,2) and (3,3) are both free, I think.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead for multiple turns.\n\nAlso, there's another food at (3,6) with life span 10, so it will be there until turn 80.\n\nCurrent turn 70, after move to (3,2), turn 71.\n\nI need to plan from here.\n\nFirst, let's consider the options at (3,2) for turn 71.\n\nOption 1: Move left to (2,2)\n\nThen head at (2,2), direction left.\n\nFrom there, possible moves: left to (1,2), but (1,2) is occupied? Positions: (1,2) is in the snake, it's the 11th segment: let's list indices.\n\nAfter turn 70: positions: 0:(3,2), 1:(4,2), 2:(5,2), 3:(5,3), 4:(4,3), 5:(4,4), 6:(4,5), 7:(3,5), 8:(2,5), 9:(1,5), 10:(1,4), 11:(1,3), 12:(1,2), 13:(1,1), 14:(2,1), 15:(3,1), 16:(4,1), 17:(5,1), 18:(6,1)\n\nSo (1,2) is occupied.\n\n(1,2) is position 12.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) is not occupied.\n\nIf move left to (2,2), then at (2,2), direction left.\n\nThen from (2,2), moves:\n\n- Left to (1,2): occupied, collision\n\n- Up to (2,3): free? (2,3) not in positions, probably free.\n\n- Down to (2,1): (2,1) is occupied, position 14.\n\n- Right to (3,2): occupied, position 0, but head is moving, so (3,2) is now body, collision. Also, right might be opposite? Current direction left, moving right is opposite, not allowed anyway.\n\nSo from (2,2), only possible move is up to (2,3), since left, down, right are invalid or occupied.\n\nLeft to (1,2) occupied, down to (2,1) occupied, right not allowed, so only up to (2,3).\n\nThen from (2,3), and so on.\n\nBut let's not go too deep yet.\n\nBack to turn 71 at (3,2).\n\nOption 2: Move up to (3,3)\n\nThen head at (3,3), direction up.\n\n(3,3) should be free, no food or anything.\n\nThen from there, possible moves.\n\nNow, I need to think about the food at (3,6).\n\n(3,6) has value 1, life span 10, so it will disappear at turn 80.\n\nCurrent turn after 70 is 71, so life span 10 means it will be there for 10 turns from now? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n\nAt turn 70, food at (3,6) has life span 10, so it decreases to 9 at turn 71, 8 at 72, ..., gone at turn 80.\n\nSimilarly for (3,2), it was eaten at turn 70, so gone.\n\nNow, (3,6) is at y=6, x=3.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), which is adjacent.\n\nThe snake is currently around the bottom-left, head at (3,2) after turn 70.\n\nTo reach (3,6), it needs to go up.\n\nBut there might be paths.\n\nAlso, the tail is at (6,1), which will move as the snake moves, unless it eats food.\n\nCurrently, after eating at turn 70, the snake is longer, tail at (6,1).\n\nWhen the snake moves without eating, the tail moves.\n\nTo reach (3,6), it might take several turns.\n\nBut I need to plan a sequence of moves.\n\nSince I have to output actions for multiple turns, but the state might change, but in this case, no new food spawns, I think? The state only gives current food, and no mention of new food spawning, so I assume only these two foods exist for now.\n\nThe problem doesn't say food spawns, so I think only these are present.\n\nLife span decreases, and when gone, no new food, I assume.\n\nSo only two foods, one eaten, one at (3,6).\n\nTo maximize score, I should try to eat (3,6) before it disappears.\n\nBut need to do so safely.\n\nNow, back to turn 71 choices.\n\nAt (3,2), I can go left to (2,2) or up to (3,3).\n\nIf I go left to (2,2), then as above, only move is up to (2,3), then from (2,3), I can go up to (2,4), etc., but let's see the body.\n\nIf I go up to (3,3) from (3,2), then head at (3,3), direction up.\n\nThen from (3,3), possible moves:\n\n- Up to (3,4): is it free? (3,4) not in positions, should be free.\n\n- Down to (3,2): occupied, and opposite direction? Current direction up, down is opposite, not allowed.\n\n- Left to (2,3): free? (2,3) not occupied.\n\n- Right to (4,3): (4,3) is occupied, position 4 in the list.\n\nAfter turn 70, position 4 is (4,3), which is body.\n\nSo from (3,3):\n\n- Up to (3,4): free\n\n- Down: not allowed, opposite\n\n- Left to (2,3): free\n\n- Right to (4,3): occupied, collision\n\nSo possible: up to (3,4) or left to (2,3).\n\nNow, comparing the paths.\n\nIf I go to (2,2) first, then to (2,3), etc., I might be going left, away from (3,6).\n\n(3,6) is at x=3,y=6, head at (3,2), so same x, different y.\n\nSo moving up is directly towards it.\n\nBut there might be obstacles.\n\nFor example, at (3,4) or (3,5), etc.\n\n(3,5) is occupied by snake body, position 7: (3,5)\n\nAfter turn 70, positions: (3,5) is there.\n\nSo from (3,3), if I go up to (3,4), then (3,4) might be free.\n\nThen from (3,4), I can go up to (3,5), but (3,5) is occupied, collision.\n\n(3,5) is position 7, body segment.\n\nSo cannot go directly up to (3,5) from (3,4).\n\nSimilarly, left to (2,4) or something.\n\nBut let's think carefully.\n\nI need to find a path to (3,6) without colliding.\n\nAlso, the tail will move as we go.\n\nFirst, let's consider the state after turn 70: head at (3,2), body: (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) tail.\n\nThe snake is coiled around.\n\nTo reach (3,6), we need to go up, but (3,3), (3,4) might be free, but (3,5) is occupied.\n\n(3,4) is not occupied, I think.\n\nPositions: (3,5) is at y=5, x=3.\n\n(3,4) is not listed, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,3) free.\n\nBut (3,5) occupied.\n\nAlso, (4,5) occupied, etc.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), which is near (3,6).\n\n(3,6) and (4,6) are adjacent.\n\n(4,6) is wall, so (3,6) is accessible, but (4,6) blocked.\n\nNow, from head at (3,2), to go to (3,6), I need to go up to y=6, but at y=5, (3,5) is occupied, so I cannot go directly up.\n\nI need to go around.\n\nFor example, go left to (2,2), then up to (2,3), (2,4), etc.\n\nOr from (3,3) go left to (2,3), then up.\n\n(2,5) is occupied, position 8: (2,5)\n\n(1,5), (1,4), etc. are occupied.\n\nThe upper part is occupied by snake body.\n\nLet me sketch the grid mentally.\n\nGrid 8x8, x 0 to 7, y 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, but the snake is inside, so we can move to x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, I think, but borders are walls, so valid cells are x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), so (4,6) is wall.\n\nFood at (3,6), which is x=3,y=6.\n\nSnake after turn 70:\n\n- (3,2) head\n\n- (4,2)\n\n- (5,2)\n\n- (5,3)\n\n- (4,3)\n\n- (4,4)\n\n- (4,5)  // at (4,5)\n\n- (3,5)  // at (3,5)\n\n- (2,5)\n\n- (1,5)\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (1,3)\n\n- (1,2)\n\n- (1,1)\n\n- (2,1)\n\n- (3,1)\n\n- (4,1)\n\n- (5,1)\n\n- (6,1) tail\n\nNow, free cells: for example, (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4) is occupied, (5,4) might be free, etc.\n\n(3,4) is free, (2,4) might be free.\n\n(2,4) not in positions, so free.\n\n(3,4) free.\n\n(4,4) occupied.\n\n(5,4) not in positions, free.\n\n(6,2), (6,3), etc.\n\nBut we need to go to (3,6).\n\n(3,6) is at x=3,y=6.\n\nAdjacent cells: (3,5) is occupied by snake, (2,6), (4,6), but (4,6) is wall, (3,7) would be y=7, border wall, so invalid.\n\nSo (3,6) can only be accessed from (2,6) or (4,6) or (3,5), but (4,6) wall, (3,5) occupied, so only possible from (2,6) or from above, but y=7 wall, so only (2,6) is the only adjacent free cell? (2,6) is at x=2,y=6.\n\n(2,6) is not occupied, and not wall, since x=2,y=6, borders are x=0,7 and y=0,7, so (2,6) is valid.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) wall, (3,7) invalid, so (3,6) can be accessed from left (2,6), right (4,6) but wall, down (3,5) occupied, up invalid. So only from (2,6).\n\nTherefore, to eat (3,6), the head must come from (2,6), since (3,5) is occupied and will be for some time.\n\n(3,5) is part of the body, and as the snake moves, it might free up.\n\nBut currently occupied.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) is occupied, etc.\n\nSo to reach (3,6), we need to go to (2,6) first.\n\n(2,6) is at x=2,y=6.\n\nNow, from current head (3,2), how to get to (2,6).\n\nOne way is to go left and up.\n\nFor example, at turn 71, from (3,2), move left to (2,2).\n\nThen at (2,2), direction left.\n\nThen only move up to (2,3), since other moves invalid.\n\nAt (2,3), direction up (since moved up).\n\nThen from (2,3), possible moves:\n\n- Up to (2,4): free? (2,4) not occupied, should be free.\n\n- Down to (2,2): occupied, and opposite? Current direction up, down opposite, not allowed.\n\n- Left to (1,3): (1,3) is occupied, position 11.\n\n- Right to (3,3): free? (3,3) not occupied.\n\nSo possible: up to (2,4) or right to (3,3).\n\nIf go up to (2,4), then at (2,4), direction up.\n\nThen from (2,4):\n\n- Up to (2,5): but (2,5) is occupied, position 8.\n\n- Down: not allowed, opposite\n\n- Left to (1,4): (1,4) occupied, position 10\n\n- Right to (3,4): free, (3,4) not occupied\n\nSo only possible move is right to (3,4).\n\nThen at (3,4), direction right? Moved right from (2,4) to (3,4), so direction right.\n\nThen from (3,4):\n\n- Up to (3,5): occupied, collision\n\n- Down to (3,3): but (3,3) might be free or not; at this point, if we came from (2,4), (3,3) was free earlier, but depending on time.\n\n- Left to (2,4): occupied, since we came from there\n\n- Right to (4,4): (4,4) occupied, position 5.\n\nCurrent direction right, so moving left might be opposite? From (3,4), moved right to here? At (3,4), direction is right, since last move was right.\n\nSo possible moves:\n\n- Up to (3,5): occupied, collision\n\n- Down to (3,3): not opposite, and (3,3) should be free, but is it?\n\n- Left to (2,4): occupied, and left is opposite to current direction right? Current direction right, moving left is opposite, not allowed.\n\n- Right to (4,4): occupied, collision\n\nDown to (3,3): current direction right, down is not opposite, it's perpendicular, so should be allowed.\n\nIn snake, you can turn, only instant reverse not allowed.\n\nSo from (3,4) with direction right, can move up, down, or right, but not left (opposite).\n\nBut up to (3,5) occupied, right to (4,4) occupied, down to (3,3) should be free.\n\n(3,3) is free, as per earlier.\n\nSo only move down to (3,3).\n\nBut (3,3) is below, and we want to go up to (2,6).\n\nThis is not helping.\n\nFrom (2,4), instead of going right to (3,4), we could... at (2,4), only move was right to (3,4), as above.\n\nAfter (2,3), we could have gone right to (3,3) instead of up to (2,4).\n\nBack to (2,3): from (2,3), we can go up to (2,4) or right to (3,3).\n\nIf go right to (3,3), then at (3,3), direction right (since moved right from (2,3)).\n\nThen from (3,3):\n\n- Up to (3,4): free\n\n- Down to (3,2): occupied, and down is not opposite, but (3,2) is occupied.\n\n- Left to (2,3): occupied, and left is opposite to current direction right? Current direction right, moving left opposite, not allowed.\n\n- Right to (4,3): occupied, collision\n\nSo only possible move is up to (3,4).\n\nThen at (3,4), direction up.\n\nThen from (3,4):\n\n- Up to (3,5): occupied, collision\n\n- Down to (3,3): occupied, and down opposite to up? Current direction up, down opposite, not allowed.\n\n- Left to (2,4): free? (2,4) should be free\n\n- Right to (4,4): occupied\n\nSo only possible move left to (2,4).\n\nThen at (2,4), direction left.\n\nThen from (2,4):\n\n- Up to (2,5): occupied, collision\n\n- Down to (2,3): occupied, and down opposite to up? Current direction left, down is perpendicular, not opposite.\n\nOpposite of left is right.\n\nFrom (2,4), direction left, so can move up, down, left, but not right.\n\n- Left to (1,4): occupied, collision\n\n- Down to (2,3): (2,3) is occupied? At this point, if we came from (2,4) to (2,3)? From (2,4), moving down to (2,3).\n\n(2,3) was free earlier, but now, in this path, when we move to (2,3), it might be occupied or not, but in the sequence, as the snake moves, the tail moves, so positions change.\n\nI think I forgot that the snake moves, so the body positions change over turns.\n\nIn each turn, when the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves if no food eaten.\n\nBut in this case, after turn 70, we ate food, so tail didn't move.\n\nAt turn 71, when we move, if we don't eat food, the tail moves.\n\nSo let's simulate the moves.\n\nStart from turn 70 state after move: head at (3,2), positions: [(3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)] 19 segments.\n\nTurn 71: we need to choose action.\n\nOption A: move left to (2,2)\n\nThen new head at (2,2), no food there, so tail moves: tail at (6,1) is removed, so new positions: head (2,2), then (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)  -- tail was (6,1), removed, so now 18 segments, tail at (5,1).\n\nPositions: 0:(2,2), 1:(3,2), 2:(4,2), 3:(5,2), 4:(5,3), 5:(4,3), 6:(4,4), 7:(4,5), 8:(3,5), 9:(2,5), 10:(1,5), 11:(1,4), 12:(1,3), 13:(1,2), 14:(1,1), 15:(2,1), 16:(3,1), 17:(4,1), 18:(5,1) tail.\n\nDirection now left.\n\nFrom (2,2), only move up to (2,3), as before, since left to (1,2) occupied, down to (2,1) occupied, right not allowed.\n\nSo turn 72: move up to (2,3)\n\nNo food, so tail moves: tail (5,1) removed, new positions: head (2,3), then (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) -- tail at (4,1)\n\nDirection up.\n\nFrom (2,3), possible moves: up to (2,4), or right to (3,3), etc.\n\n(2,4) free, (3,3) free.\n\nIf move up to (2,4), no food.\n\nTail moves: turn 73: move up to (2,4)\n\nPositions: head (2,4), then (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1) tail at (3,1)\n\nDirection up.\n\nFrom (2,4), possible moves: up to (2,5) but (2,5) occupied (position 9 or something, in current list, (2,5) is position 9, occupied), down not allowed (opposite), left to (1,4) occupied, right to (3,4) free.\n\nSo only move right to (3,4)\n\nTurn 74: move right to (3,4)\n\nNo food, tail moves: tail (3,1) removed, positions: head (3,4), then (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1) tail at (2,1)\n\nDirection right.\n\nFrom (3,4), possible moves: up to (3,5) occupied, down to (3,3) free, left to (2,4) occupied, right to (4,4) occupied.\n\nCurrent direction right, so moving left not allowed (opposite).\n\nSo only possible move down to (3,3)\n\nTurn 75: move down to (3,3)\n\nNo food, tail moves: tail (2,1) removed, positions: head (3,3), then (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) tail at (1,1)\n\nDirection down.\n\nAnd so on. We are not getting closer to (3,6).\n\nNow, alternative path from turn 71.\n\nAt turn 71, from (3,2), move up to (3,3)\n\nThen new head at (3,3), no food, so tail moves: tail (6,1) removed, positions: head (3,3), then (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) tail at (5,1)\n\nDirection up.\n\nFrom (3,3), possible moves: up to (3,4) free, or left to (2,3) free, or down to (3,2) occupied, right to (4,3) occupied.\n\nCurrent direction up, so down not allowed (opposite).\n\nSo move up to (3,4) or left to (2,3).\n\nIf move up to (3,4), turn 72: move up to (3,4)\n\nNo food, tail moves: tail (5,1) removed, positions: head (3,4), then (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) tail at (4,1)\n\nDirection up.\n\nFrom (3,4), possible moves: up to (3,5) occupied, down not allowed (opposite), left to (2,4) free, right to (4,4) occupied.\n\nSo only move left to (2,4)\n\nTurn 73: move left to (2,4)\n\nNo food, tail moves: tail (4,1) removed, positions: head (2,4), then (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1) tail at (2,1)\n\nDirection left.\n\nFrom (2,4), possible moves: up to (2,5) occupied, down to (2,3) free, left to (1,4) occupied, right to (3,4) occupied.\n\nCurrent direction left, so right not allowed (opposite).\n\nSo only move down to (2,3)\n\nTurn 74: move down to (2,3)\n\nNo food, tail moves: tail (2,1) removed, positions: head (2,3), then (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) tail at (1,1)\n\nDirection down.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nStill not towards (3,6).\n\nBut (3,6) is at y=6, and we are at lower y.\n\nThe body is blocking the direct path.\n\nPerhaps I need to move in a way that the tail moves and frees up space.\n\nFor example, if I can make the snake move in a circle or something to free (3,5).\n\nBut (3,5) is occupied, and it will be freed when the tail moves past it.\n\nThe tail is at (6,1), and the body goes through (3,5), which is position 7, so it will take many moves for the tail to reach (3,5).\n\nFrom tail to (3,5): the snake is 18 segments after turn 70, but after turn 70 we ate, so 19, but then when we move without eating, tail moves.\n\nThe distance from tail to (3,5): in the list, (3,5) is position 7, tail is position 18, so 11 segments away, so it will take 11 moves for the tail to reach (3,5), meaning (3,5) will be occupied until then.\n\nSimilarly for other cells.\n\nAt turn 70, positions, (3,5) is index 7.\n\nAfter each move without eating, the tail moves forward, so the position (3,5) will be occupied until the segment that is there moves away.\n\nThe segment at (3,5) will move when the snake moves, but the cell (3,5) will be freed when the segment that was there at turn 70 has moved away.\n\nLet's think of the index.\n\nAt turn 70, position i=7 is (3,5).\n\nAfter k moves without eating, the segment at i=7 will be at position 7-k in the list, but the cell it occupies changes.\n\nThe cell (3,5) is occupied by the segment that is there.\n\nAs the snake moves, each segment moves to the next position.\n\nSo at turn 70, cell (3,5) has segment.\n\nWhen the snake moves, head moves to new cell, each segment shifts, so the segment that was at (3,5) moves to the next position in the path.\n\nIn this case, the snake is not moving in a straight line; it's coiled.\n\nFrom the positions, at turn 70, the segment at (3,5) came from (4,5) or something.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the body segments move to the position of the previous segment.\n\nFor example, when head moves to new position, the first body segment moves to where head was, second to where first was, and so on, tail moves away if no growth.\n\nSo for cell (3,5), at turn 70, it is occupied.\n\nAfter one move without eating, say head moves to new cell, then the segment that was at (3,5) will move to where the previous segment was, but it depends on the path.\n\nThe cell (3,5) will be freed when the segment that was there moves to a different cell, and no other segment moves to it immediately.\n\nBut it's messy.\n\nThe cell (3,5) will be occupied until the tail passes through it or something.\n\nSince the snake is fixed in shape until it moves, the cell (3,5) will be occupied for as long as the segment remains, but as the snake moves, the segment moves.\n\nThe segment at (3,5) at turn 70 is part of the body, and when the snake moves, this segment will move to the position that was the head or something.\n\nLet's take an example.\n\nSuppose at turn 71, we move from (3,2) to some place.\n\nIf we move to (2,2), then new positions: head (2,2), then (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), etc.\n\nThe segment that was at (3,5) is now at position 8 in the new list, and it is still at (3,5) because the body didn't move relative, but in this move, since head moved to (2,2), the body segments shifted: the segment that was at (3,2) is now at (3,2) but it's the second position, and the segment that was at (3,5) is still at (3,5) because no one moved it yet.\n\nIn the move, when head moves to new position, the first body segment moves to the old head position, which is (3,2), so the segment that was at (4,2) moves to (3,2), but (4,2) was position 1, moves to position 0 old, which is (3,2).\n\nThen the segment that was at (5,2) position 2 moves to position 1 old, (4,2), and so on.\n\nFor (3,5): at turn 70, position 7 is (3,5).\n\nAfter head moves to (2,2), the new position 7 is the old position 8, which is (2,5), so (3,5) is now occupied by the segment that was at position 6, which is (4,5), because position 6 moves to position 7 old, which is (3,5).\n\nOld positions: 0:(3,2), 1:(4,2), 2:(5,2), 3:(5,3), 4:(4,3), 5:(4,4), 6:(4,5), 7:(3,5), 8:(2,5), ...\n\nAfter move to (2,2), new positions: head (2,2), then old 0:(3,2), so (3,2) is new position 1, then old 1:(4,2) new position 2, old 2:(5,2) new position 3, old 3:(5,3) new position 4, old 4:(4,3) new position 5, old 5:(4,4) new position 6, old 6:(4,5) new position 7, old 7:(3,5) new position 8, etc.\n\nSo new position 7 is (4,5) from old 6, and new position 8 is (3,5) from old 7, so (3,5) is still occupied by the same segment, at new position 8.\n\nSimilarly, the cell (3,5) is still occupied.\n\nAfter each move without eating, the tail moves, but the body shifts, so (3,5) remains occupied until the segment that was there is pushed out or something.\n\nThe segment at (3,5) will stay there until it moves to a new position, which happens when the snake moves in a way that this segment is advanced.\n\nIn this case, since the snake is not moving towards the head, the segment at (3,5) will only move when the head moves and the body shifts, but the cell may change.\n\nFor example, if the head moves up or down, the body follows, so the segment at (3,5) will move to where the previous segment was.\n\nIn the above, when head moved to (2,2), the segment that was at (3,5) moved to new position 8, still at (3,5), because the body didn't change position; only the head and the connections.\n\nIn this specific snake shape, the body at (3,5) is not moving because the head moved left, but the body is fixed relative.\n\nTo free (3,5), we need the snake to move in a way that the segment at (3,5) is advanced to a different cell.\n\nFor instance, if the head moves in a direction that pulls the body, eventually (3,5) will be vacated.\n\nThe cell (3,5) will be occupied for a number of turns equal to the distance from the head to that segment in the chain.\n\nAt turn 70, (3,5) is position 7, so it will take 7 moves for that segment to become the tail and move away, but when it moves, it leaves the cell free.\n\nAfter k moves without eating, the segment that was at position k will be at the tail position when k equals the length minus something.\n\nAfter k moves without eating, the tail moves k times, so the segment that was at position m from the head will be at position m-k when m-k >0, and if m-k <=0, it's gone.\n\nFor a cell occupied at position i at time t, after k moves, it will be occupied by the segment that was at position i+k at time t, until i+k exceeds the length.\n\nThe cell is freed when the segment that was there at t has moved away, which happens after i moves, because the segment at position i will move to position i-1 after one move, and so on, until it becomes the tail after i moves, and on the next move, it moves away.\n\nAt time t, position i is occupied.\n\nAfter one move, the segment at i moves to the position that was i-1 at time t, so cell (x,y) that was at i is now occupied by the segment that was at i-1 or something.\n\nIt's better to think that the cell is occupied by a segment until that segment is no longer there, which happens when the snake moves and that segment advances.\n\nFor position (3,5) at turn 70, it is position 7.\n\nThe segment at position 7 will move to a new cell when the snake moves, depending on the direction.\n\nBut in general, it will take approximately 7 moves for this segment to be the one that is at the tail position and then moved from.\n\nAfter 7 moves without eating, the segment that was at position 7 will be at the tail, and on the 8th move, it will move away, freeing the cell.\n\nSimilarly for other cells.\n\nFor (3,5), at turn 70 position 7, so it will be freed after 8 moves without eating (since after 7 moves it is tail, on 8th move tail moves).\n\nAfter k moves, the tail is the segment that was at position k at time t.\n\nAt time t, position L-1 is tail.\n\nAfter one move, position L-1 is removed if no growth, so the new tail is the segment that was at position L-2 at time t.\n\nAfter k moves, the new tail is the segment that was at position (L-1) - k at time t, for k from 0 to L-1.\n\nWhen (L-1) - k = i, then the segment at position i at time t becomes the tail after k moves, where k = (L-1) - i.\n\nThen on the next move, it moves away.\n\nFor cell at position i at time t, it will be freed after k+1 moves, where k = (L-1) - i, so after (L-1) - i +1 = L - i moves.\n\nFor (3,5) at turn 70, i=7, L=19 (after growth), so it will be freed after 19 - 7 = 12 moves without eating.\n\nSimilarly, for (3,6), we need to access it, but it can only be accessed from (2,6) since (3,5) is blocked until freed.\n\n(2,6) is free now.\n\nAt turn 70, (2,6) is free.\n\nBut to reach it, we need to go to (2,6).\n\nFrom current position (3,2), we can go to (2,2), then to (2,3), etc., up to (2,6).\n\n(2,6) is at y=6, so from (2,2) to (2,6) is 4 steps up.\n\nBut at (2,4) or (2,5), (2,5) is occupied.\n\n(2,5) is position 9 at turn 70.\n\ni=9, L=19, so freed after 19-9=10 moves.\n\nSimilarly, (2,4) is free.\n\nSo to go to (2,6), we can go to (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), then to (2,5) but (2,5) occupied, so cannot go directly.\n\nFrom (2,4), we can go to (3,4) or other, but not up to (2,5).\n\nSo we need to wait for (2,5) to be free.\n\nSimilarly, for (3,6), we need (2,6) or (3,5), but (3,5) occupied.\n\nBut (2,6) is free, so if we can reach (2,6), we can then move to (3,6) to eat it.\n\nBut from (2,6) to (3,6) is right move.\n\nBut (3,6) has food, so we can eat it.\n\nBut to reach (2,6), from current position.\n\nOne way is to go to (2,2), then (2,3), (2,4), then we need (2,5) free, which will take many turns.\n\nSince the food at (3,6) has life span 10, from turn 70, it will disappear at turn 80.\n\nTurn 70: life span 10, so after turn 70, it has 9 turns left, gone after turn 79? Let's clarify.\n\nFood life span: at turn t, food has life span N, it will disappear after N turns, including the current turn.\n\nSo at turn 70, life span 4 for (3,2) which we ate, and for (3,6) life span 10.\n\nAfter turn 70, at turn 71, life span of (3,6) is 9, then 8 at 72, ..., 1 at 79, gone at turn 80.\n\nSo it can be eaten from turn 70 to turn 79 inclusive.\n\nWe have from turn 70 to 79 to eat it.\n\nAt turn 70, we are at (3,2), and we must move to (3,2) as only choice.\n\nThen at turn 71, head at (3,2), direction L.\n\nTo reach (2,6), we can go via (3,3), (3,4), then to (2,4) or something, but (3,5) blocked.\n\nFrom (3,2), move up to (3,3), then to (3,4), then to (2,4), then to (2,5) when free, but not yet.\n\nAt turn 71, if we move up to (3,3), as above.\n\nThen from there, we can go to (3,4), then to (2,4), then from (2,4), we can go to (2,5) when free, but at turn 71, (2,5) is occupied, and it will be for several turns.\n\nThe number of moves to free (2,5): at turn 70, (2,5) is position 9, L=19, so freed after 19-9=10 moves without eating.\n\nSince we are not eating, after 10 moves, at turn 80, it would be freed, but turn 80 is when food disappears, so too late.\n\nTurn 70: after 10 moves without eating, at turn 80, (2,5) is freed, but food at (3,6) disappears at turn 80, so we can't eat it at turn 80.\n\nWe need to eat by turn 79.\n\nAt turn 79, if we can be at (2,6) and move to (3,6) on turn 79.\n\nBut (2,5) needs to be free to go to (2,6) from (2,5), but (2,6) is at y=6, (2,5) at y=5.\n\nFrom (2,5) to (2,6) is up move.\n\n(2,5) will be freed after 10 moves, at turn 80, but at turn 79, it is still occupied if we start from turn 70.\n\nLet's calculate the turn when (2,5) is freed.\n\nAt turn 70, (2,5) occupied, position i=9.\n\nAfter k moves, it is freed when the segment that was there has moved away, which after L - i moves.\n\nL=19, i=9, so after 10 moves, at turn 80, it is freed.\n\nAt turn 79, after 9 moves from turn 70, the segment that was at i=9 is now at position 9-9=0? After k moves, the segment at position i at t is now at position i-k if i-k >=0, else gone.\n\nAt turn 70, position i=9.\n\nAfter k moves, if k <= i, the segment is at position i-k.\n\nWhen i-k <0, it is gone.\n\nFor i=9, after k=9 moves, it is at position 0, which is the head.\n\nAfter k=10 moves, it is gone, position freed.\n\nSo (2,5) is occupied until turn 79 inclusive, freed at turn 80.\n\nBut at turn 79, if we move to (2,5), it is still occupied, collision.\n\nSo we cannot go to (2,5) before turn 80.\n\nBut food at (3,6) disappears at turn 80, so we can eat it at turn 79 if we can reach (2,6) before and move to (3,6) on turn 79.\n\n(2,6) is free, so if we can be at (2,6) at turn 79, we can move to (3,6) to eat it.\n\nBut to reach (2,6), we need a path.\n\nFor example, from current position, go to (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), then to (2,5) but (2,5) occupied until turn 80, so we cannot go to (2,5) before turn 80.\n\nFrom (2,4), we can go to (3,4), but not to (2,5).\n\nOr from (2,4) to (1,4) but occupied.\n\nSo no direct way to (2,6) from below because (2,5) is blocked.\n\nSimilarly, from the right or other, but we are at left.\n\nAnother way: go to (3,3), (3,4), (4,4) but occupied, (4,4) is occupied.\n\n(4,4) position 5, i=5, L=19, freed after 14 moves, too late.\n\nOr go to (5,4) etc., but far.\n\nPerhaps it's impossible to eat the food at (3,6) because the path is blocked and the life span is short.\n\nBut life span 10 turns, from turn 70 to eat by turn 79.\n\nFrom (3,2) to (2,6) is 4 steps right and 4 steps up, but with obstacles.\n\nBut (2,5) is occupied, so we cannot go directly.\n\nWe can go via other cells, like (1,6) or (2,6) from above, but we are below.\n\nFor example, go to (3,3), then (4,3) but occupied, (4,3) position 4, occupied.\n\nOr go to (2,3), then (2,4), then (1,4) occupied, or (3,4), then (3,5) occupied.\n\nNo clear path.\n\nPerhaps the snake can move in a way to free space faster.\n\nBut with the current position, it's tight.\n\nMaybe at turn 71, from (3,2), we have to choose left or up, but both seem to lead away.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nPerhaps for short-term survival, we can go to (2,2) or (3,3), but since we need to plan 5 turns, and the food at (3,6) might not be reachable, we should focus on survival and avoid risks.\n\nAt turn 70, we must move L to (3,2).\n\nThen at turn 71, from (3,2), we can move left to (2,2) or up to (3,3).\n\nIf we move left to (2,2), then as before, only move up to (2,3).\n\nThen from (2,3), we can go up to (2,4) or right to (3,3).\n\nIf we go right to (3,3), then to (3,4), etc.\n\nBut let's assume we go left to (2,2) on turn 71.\n\nTurn 71: move L to (2,2), no food, tail moves, positions as before.\n\nTurn 72: move U to (2,3), no food, tail moves.\n\nThen at (2,3), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,4) or R to (3,3).\n\nIf we go U to (2,4), then turn 73: move U to (2,4), no food, tail moves.\n\nThen at (2,4), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: only R to (3,4), since U to (2,5) occupied, D not allowed, L occupied.\n\nTurn 74: move R to (3,4), no food, tail moves.\n\nThen at (3,4), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: only D to (3,3), as U occupied, L occupied, R occupied.\n\nTurn 75: move D to (3,3), no food, tail moves.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nIf at (2,3) we go R to (3,3), turn 72: move R to (3,3), no food, tail moves.\n\nThen at (3,3), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,4) or D to (3,2) occupied, L not allowed, R occupied.\n\nSo U to (3,4).\n\nTurn 73: move U to (3,4), no food, tail moves.\n\nThen at (3,4), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: L to (2,4) or D not allowed, U occupied, R occupied.\n\nSo L to (2,4).\n\nTurn 74: move L to (2,4), no food, tail moves.\n\nThen at (2,4), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: D to (2,3) or U occupied, L occupied, R not allowed.\n\nSo D to (2,3).\n\nTurn 75: move D to (2,3), no food, tail moves.\n\nSo in both cases, we end up looping or moving in a small area.\n\nTo reach (3,6), it might not be possible within the life span, so we should just survive and not take risks.\n\nBut there are no other foods, so no point in eating, just avoid dying.\n\nAt turn 71, from (3,2), moving to (2,2) or (3,3) is similar.\n\nPerhaps moving to (3,3) is slightly better because it's closer to the center or something.\n\nBut both are fine.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe question is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but since the state changes, I need to plan a sequence based on current state.\n\nBut in this case, for turn 70, action must be L.\n\nThen for turn 71, I can choose U or L, but L to (2,2) or U to (3,3).\n\nSince the food at (3,6) is likely unreachable, I can choose either.\n\nBut let's see if there's a way.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps move to (3,3), then to (3,4), then to (4,4) but occupied, or to (2,4), then from (2,4) to (2,5) when free, but not free soon.\n\nOr from (3,4) to (4,4) when free, but (4,4) position 5, i=5, L=19, freed after 14 moves, at turn 84, too late.\n\nSimilarly, other cells.\n\nSo probably, we cannot eat the food, so we should just move safely.\n\nFor turn 71, I can choose to move U to (3,3) or L to (2,2).\n\nLet's say I choose U to (3,3) for no particular reason.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, based on available moves.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output a sequence.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns.\n\nTurn 70: L\n\nTurn 71: U (up)\n\nThen turn 72: from (3,3), after moving U, direction U, then to (3,4)\n\nTurn 73: to (2,4) or (3,4) to (2,4)\n\n etc.\n\nBut let's define.\n\nSince the only risky thing is the tail reward danger, but here no food near tail, so no issue.\n\nAlso, walls.\n\nSo for now, at turn 70: action L\n\nTurn 71: let's say U\n\nThen turn 72: from (3,3) direction U, move U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 73: from (3,4) direction U, move L to (2,4)\n\nTurn 74: from (2,4) direction L, move D to (2,3) or something.\n\nBut I need to specify.\n\nPerhaps I can go to the right side.\n\nFor example, at turn 71, from (3,2), if I move U to (3,3), then turn 72 move U to (3,4), turn 73 move L to (2,4), then from (2,4) I can move D to (2,3) or, at turn 74, from (2,4) direction L, move D to (2,3)\n\nThen at (2,3), direction D, then move D to (2,2) or R to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut it's repetitive.\n\nTo break out, perhaps at some point move to (3,4), then to (4,4) when free, but not soon.\n\nOr to (5,4) etc.\n\nFor example, at turn 73, at (3,4), instead of moving L to (2,4), but at (3,4) direction U, only L to (2,4) is possible, as per earlier.\n\nNo other choice.\n\nSo the snake is trapped in a small area and will loop until it can escape or something.\n\nBut eventually, when the tail moves, some space frees, but slowly.\n\nFor the purpose of this, since we need to output actions, and for turn 70, only L is possible.\n\nThen for turn 71, I can choose U or L.\n\nLet's choose U to (3,3).\n\nThen for turn 72, from (3,3) move U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 73, from (3,4) move L to (2,4)\n\nTurn 74, from (2,4) move D to (2,3)  -- since only choice\n\nTurn 75, from (2,3) direction D, then possible moves: D to (2,2) or R to (3,3)\n\nIf move R to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut for 5 turns, I can output up to turn 74 or 75.\n\nThe current turn is 70, so actions for turn 70 to, say, 74 or 75.\n\nBut let's see the format.\n\nAnswer should be in a box with actions for each turn.\n\nSince at turn 70, action is L, and for turn 71, I need to choose.\n\nPerhaps for the first few turns, it's determined.\n\nTurn 70: L\n\nTurn 71: from (3,2), I can choose U or L, but both are safe, so I'll choose U for variety.\n\nThen turn 72: U to (3,4) from (3,3)\n\nTurn 73: L to (2,4)\n\nTurn 74: D to (2,3) from (2,4)\n\nTurn 75: from (2,3), can move D to (2,2) or R to (3,3)\n\nLet's say move R to (3,3)\n\nBut (3,3) might be free at that time, depending.\n\nIn general, it should be safe.\n\nSo for output:\n\nTurn 70: L\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nTurn 73: L\n\nTurn 74: D\n\nTurn 75: R  for example.\n\nBut turn 72 is from (3,3) to (3,4), which is U.\n\nTurn 73 from (3,4) to (2,4), L.\n\nTurn 74 from (2,4) to (2,3), D.\n\nTurn 75 from (2,3) to (3,3), R.\n\nThen at (3,3), and so on.\n\nBut it's a loop.\n\nSince we need to think 5+ turns ahead, but in this case, no food to eat, so survival is key.\n\nFor the food at (3,6), it might be possible if we move towards it, but with the block, it's hard.\n\nPerhaps from (3,4), we can go to (4,4) when free, but not soon.\n\nI think it's not feasible, so I'll go with the sequence.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\nAt turn 70, action must be L.\n\nThen for turn 71, I'll choose U.\n\nThen turn 72 U, turn 73 L, turn 74 D, turn 75 R, for example.\n\nBut let's make it consistent.\n\nSince the head direction changes, but in the actions, we output U/D/L/R.\n\nAlso, in the state, at turn 70, head direction is given, but for subsequent, it changes.\n\nBut for output, we just output the action.\n\nSo for turn 70: L\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nTurn 72: U  ( to (3,4) )\n\nTurn 73: L  ( to (2,4) )\n\nTurn 74: D  ( to (2,3) )\n\nThen for turn 75, from (2,3), direction D (since moved down), then can move D to (2,2) or R to (3,3) or U to (2,4) occupied, L to (1,3) occupied.\n\nSo D or R.\n\nI can choose R to (3,3).\n\nSo Turn 75: R\n\nBut (3,3) might be free at that turn.\n\nSimilarly, it can continue.\n\nFor the output, I'll do up to turn 74 or 75.\n\nThe current turn is 70, so actions for 70 to 74 or 75.\n\nSince the food at (3,6) has life span 10, and we are at turn 70, by turn 71 to 79, but with 5 turns ahead, we can't reach it anyway.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 70: L\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nTurn 73: L\n\nTurn 74: D\n\nIf I want 5 actions, from turn 70 to 74.\n\nOr to 75.\n\nBut in the box, I need to list.\n\nAlso, for the tail reward danger, not an issue here.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\nThe current state (turn 70) requires the snake to move left (L) to (3,2) to eat the positive food there, as it is the only safe and valid move. After eating, the snake's length increases to 19 segments. The food at (3,6) has a life span of 10 turns (disappearing after turn 80) and is a potential target, but the path is blocked by the snake's body, making it unreachable within the 5+ turn planning horizon without significant risk. Specifically:\n- (3,5) is occupied by the snake's body and will remain so for approximately 12 moves (due to the snake's length and position), freeing around turn 82—too late for the food at (3,6), which disappears at turn 80.\n- (2,5) is similarly occupied and frees around turn 80, also too late.\n- Direct paths to (3,6) are blocked, and alternative routes (e.g., via (2,6)) require moving through occupied cells or waiting for them to free, which is not feasible within the food's life span.\n\nGiven the inaccessibility of (3,6) and no other food, the priority shifts to long-term survival. The snake should avoid risks (e.g., collisions) and move to open spaces to extend survival. From turn 71 onward, the snake can move safely in a loop in the available free cells (e.g., (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)) to maintain flexibility and avoid dead ends. This loop is sustainable as the tail moves gradually, freeing space over time.\n\n**Planned Moves (5 turns ahead):**\n- **Turn 70 (current)**: Move L to (3,2) to eat food—only valid move.\n- **Turn 71**: Move U to (3,3) to avoid immediate body collisions and start moving toward open space.\n- **Turn 72**: Move U to (3,4) to continue upward, away from dense body segments.\n- **Turn 73**: Move L to (2,4) to avoid the occupied (3,5) and access less congested areas.\n- **Turn 74**: Move D to (2,3) to maintain movement options and prevent trapping.\n- **Turn 75**: Move R to (3,3) to return to a central point, enabling future flexibility.\n\nThis sequence ensures survival for at least 5 turns, with no food eaten after turn 70. The loop can continue beyond turn 75 (e.g., to (3,4), (2,4), etc.) if no new food spawns.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 70: L (left)  \nTurn 71: U (up)  \nTurn 72: U (up)  \nTurn 73: L (left)  \nTurn 74: D (down)  \nTurn 75: R (right)\n}",

        "step": 71,
        "score": 18,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 71. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (3,2), and the direction is L (left). The body segments are listed: [(3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)]. That's 19 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n\nFood: only one piece given: (3,6) with life span 9 and value 1. Since value is 1, it's positive food. Life span 9 means it will disappear after 9 turns, including the current turn, so if not eaten by turn 79, it's gone.\n\nCurrent head direction is left, so from (3,2), moving left would go to (2,2). But let's see what moves are possible.\n\nI need to think about the next 5+ turns to maximize score and avoid risks. Since the snake is long, moving into tight spaces might be dangerous. Also, there's food at (3,6), which is above the head.\n\nCurrent head position: (3,2). Food is at (3,6), so same x, different y. (3,6) is directly above, since y increases upwards, I assume? In the movement, U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, so (3,6) is up from (3,2) by 4 cells.\n\nBut there are obstacles and the snake's body in the way.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (3,2)\n\nThen body: (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\nSo the tail is at (6,1).\n\nNow, the head is at (3,2), moving left. But since direction is L, and no instant reverse, I cannot move right immediately, but left is the current direction, so moving left is allowed since it's not reverse.\n\nPossible moves from (3,2):\n\n- Up (U): (x,y+1) = (3,3)\n\n- Down (D): (x,y-1) = (3,1)\n\n- Left (L): (x-1,y) = (2,2)\n\n- Right (R): (x+1,y) = (4,2) but right would be opposite to current left direction? Current direction is L, so moving right would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. So I cannot move right.\n\nDirections: U, D, L, R.\n\nCurrent head direction is L, meaning the snake is facing left. So moving left is forward, right would be backward/reverse, which is not allowed. Up and down are perpendicular, so allowed.\n\nSo possible actions: U, D, L. R is not possible.\n\nNow, check what cells are occupied or dangerous.\n\nFirst, move to (3,3): is this free?\n\nCurrent snake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n\nFrom snake: (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\nAlso, walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 cells are walls.\n\nInternal obstacle: (4,6)\n\nNow, (3,3): is it occupied? From the list, (4,3) is there, but not (3,3). (3,3) is not in the snake positions, so it should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1): is (3,1) occupied? Yes, (3,1) is part of the body.\n\n(2,2): not in the list, so free? List has (1,2), (2,1), etc., but not (2,2). So (2,2) should be free.\n\n(4,2) is occupied, but that's different.\n\nSo possible moves:\n\n- U to (3,3): free? (3,3) not in snake positions, not wall, not obstacle. Walls are only borders and internal, so (3,3) is within bounds, no wall or obstacle there. So should be free.\n\n- D to (3,1): (3,1) is occupied by snake body, so collision if I move there. Moving to a body segment is deadly unless it's the tail and the tail moves away.\n\n(3,1) is not the tail; tail is at (6,1). (3,1) is a body segment, so if head moves to (3,1), it collides with body, death. So cannot move down.\n\n- L to (2,2): (2,2) not occupied, not wall, so should be free.\n\n(2,2) is not in the snake positions, and not a wall cell. Walls are only at borders and (4,6), so (2,2) is clear.\n\nSo possible actions: U or L. D is invalid due to collision, R is invalid due to reverse.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n\nFood is at (3,6) with life span 9. Current turn 71, so it will disappear after turn 79? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 71, life span 9, turn 72:8, ..., turn 79:1, turn 80:0, but since it disappears after N turns, probably after turn 79 it's gone. If life span is N, it disappears after N turns, meaning if not eaten by the turn it reaches 0, it's gone.\n\nTypically, at turn t, food with life span L will disappear at turn t + L - 1 or something? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn 71, life span 9, so after 9 turns, meaning after turn 79, it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn 71 to turn 79 inclusive, I think. On turn 79, life span is 1, still there, eaten or not; after turn 79, gone.\n\nBut we care about when we can move to it.\n\nNow, (3,6) is the food position. But (3,6) might be under the snake body? Let's see if it's occupied.\n\nSnake positions: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), etc., but not (3,6). (3,6) is not listed, so it should be free, but food is there, so it's occupied by food, but food can be eaten if head moves there.\n\nBut the rules say: food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nIn this case, (3,6) is not under the snake body; it's free, with food.\n\nCurrent snake positions do not include (3,6), so it's a cell with food, not covered by snake.\n\nSimilarly, no other food mentioned.\n\nSo only one food at (3,6).\n\nNow, to eat it, I need to move the head to (3,6).\n\nFrom current position (3,2), I need to go up to y=6.\n\nBut there are obstacles.\n\nThe snake body is around, and there's an obstacle at (4,6).\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (4,6) is a wall, I assume.\n\nNow, path to (3,6).\n\nPossible ways: directly up, but let's see what's in the way.\n\nFrom (3,2) to (3,6): cells (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6).\n\n(3,3) is free, as we said.\n\n(3,4): is it occupied? Snake positions: (4,4) is there, but (3,4) not listed. So should be free.\n\n(3,5): is occupied? Snake has (3,5) as a body segment. Yes, (3,5) is part of the snake.\n\nFrom the list: (4,5), (3,5), so (3,5) is occupied.\n\n(3,6) is food.\n\nSo to reach (3,6), I need to get to (3,5) first, but (3,5) is occupied by body.\n\nBut according to rules, I can only eat food if the body moves away from that cell.\n\nSpecifically for (3,6), since it's not under body, I can move to it directly if I can reach it.\n\nBut to reach (3,6), I need to be at (3,5) or adjacent, but (3,5) is occupied, so I cannot move directly to (3,6) from (3,5) because (3,5) is blocked.\n\nThe head can only move to adjacent cells: up, down, left, right.\n\nFrom (3,2), I can go to (3,3), then from (3,3) to (3,4), then to (3,5)? But (3,5) is occupied, so moving to (3,5) would cause collision unless it's the tail.\n\n(3,5) is not the tail; tail is at (6,1). So moving to (3,5) is death.\n\nTherefore, I cannot directly go up to (3,6) because (3,5) is in the way.\n\nSimilarly, I need to find another path.\n\nFor example, go left or right, then up.\n\nBut right might not be possible now, since current direction is left, and moving right is reverse, not allowed.\n\nBut in future turns, direction changes.\n\nCurrent possible moves: U to (3,3) or L to (2,2).\n\nIf I go U to (3,3), then from there, possible moves.\n\n(3,3) is free.\n\nThen from (3,3), head direction would be U, since I moved up.\n\nThen I can move U to (3,4), or L to (2,3), or R to (4,3), or D to (3,2), but (3,2) is now the neck, since head was at (3,2), moved to (3,3), so body is at (3,2), then (4,2), etc.\n\nAfter moving to (3,3), the new head is (3,3), and the body: the tail end moves forward, so the segment at (6,1) is removed, and a new segment added at head if food eaten, but not eaten yet.\n\nWhen snake moves, it moves head to new position, and tail moves from current tail position, so the last segment is removed, unless food is eaten, then tail doesn't move, length increases.\n\nBut here, no food eaten yet.\n\nSo after move to (3,3), snake positions: head at (3,3), then body: (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) — tail was (6,1), removed, so (5,1) is now tail? Positions: after head moves to (3,3), the segment that was at (3,2) is now the first body segment, and tail from (6,1) is removed, so new tail is (5,1)? Let's list the positions.\n\nOriginal: head (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) — 19 segments.\n\nAfter moving head to (3,3), new head (3,3), then the body: the previous head (3,2) becomes neck, so positions: [(3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)] and (6,1) is removed, so tail at (5,1). 18 segments? No, length remains same unless food eaten.\n\nNumber of segments: 19 positions, after move, head moves to new cell, tail cell is vacated, so snake has 19 segments, but tail moves, so new positions: head at new position, then the first body segment at previous head position, and so on, up to the new tail, which is the second last segment of previous, since last segment is removed.\n\nPrevious positions: index 0: (3,2) head, 1: (4,2), 2: (5,2), 3: (5,3), 4: (4,3), 5: (4,4), 6: (4,5), 7: (3,5), 8: (2,5), 9: (1,5), 10: (1,4), 11: (1,3), 12: (1,2), 13: (1,1), 14: (2,1), 15: (3,1), 16: (4,1), 17: (5,1), 18: (6,1) tail.\n\nAfter moving head to (3,3), new head at (3,3), then body at previous head (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) — and (6,1) is not part of snake anymore, so tail at (5,1). So the segment that was at (5,1) is now the tail, and (6,1) is free.\n\nSimilarly, if I move left to (2,2), new head (2,2), body: (3,2), (4,2), etc., tail at (5,1), (6,1) removed.\n\nBack to choices.\n\nIf I move U to (3,3) at turn 71.\n\nThen at (3,3), head direction U.\n\nFrom there, I can move U to (3,4), which is free? (3,4) not occupied, as per earlier.\n\nThen to (3,4), then from there, to (3,5) is occupied by body? At that time, when I move to (3,4), what is the state.\n\nLet's simulate turn by turn for a few steps.\n\nFirst, turn 71: current state, head at (3,2), dir L.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (3,3)\n\nNew head position: (3,3), new dir U.\n\nNew snake positions: head (3,3), then (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) — tail at (5,1), (6,1) gone.\n\n(3,5) is still occupied.\n\nNow, from (3,3), I can move U to (3,4), or L to (2,3), or R to (4,3), or D to (3,2) but (3,2) is now body, so D would be reverse? Current dir U, moving D is down, which is opposite to up, so instant reverse, not allowed. So cannot move D.\n\nPossible: U, L, R.\n\nU to (3,4): (3,4) is free? Currently, no snake at (3,4), so yes.\n\nL to (2,3): (2,3) not occupied, free.\n\nR to (4,3): (4,3) is occupied by snake body? Current positions, (4,3) is part of body, from above list, (4,3) is there, so moving to (4,3) would collide with body, death. Cannot move R.\n\nSo from (3,3), possible: U to (3,4) or L to (2,3).\n\nIf I move U to (3,4), new head (3,4), dir U.\n\nThen from (3,4), I can move to (3,5), but (3,5) is occupied by snake body. (3,5) is in positions, not tail, so collision. Cannot move to (3,5).\n\nOther moves: from (3,4), dir U, so can move U, L, R. D is reverse, not allowed.\n\nU to (3,5): occupied, death.\n\nL to (2,4): (2,4) not occupied? Let's see, current positions after previous move.\n\nAfter turn 71: snake at [(3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)]\n\n(2,4) not in list, so free.\n\nR to (4,4): (4,4) is occupied, from list, (4,4) is there, so cannot move R.\n\nD to (3,3) but reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo from (3,4), possible moves: L to (2,4) or U to (3,5) but U to (3,5) is death, so only L to (2,4) is safe.\n\nMove L to (2,4).\n\nThen at (2,4), dir L (since moved left).\n\nThen from there, I can try to go to the food, but (3,6) is at (3,6), so from (2,4), I can move to (2,5), (2,6), or (3,4), but (3,4) is previous position.\n\nBut (2,5) is occupied? Current positions after move to (2,4).\n\nAfter moving to (3,4) at turn 72? Let's keep track of turns.\n\nTurn 71: move U to (3,3)\n\nState after turn 71: head (3,3), dir U, snake as above.\n\nTurn 72: from (3,3), move U to (3,4) — but earlier I said only L is possible, but from (3,3) I can move U to (3,4), which is free.\n\nIn turn 72, after moving to (3,4), new head (3,4), dir U.\n\nPositions: head (3,4), then (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) — (4,4) is at position 7? Let's list: after move to (3,4), new positions: head (3,4), then previous head (3,3), then (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), then (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), and tail at (5,1)? (4,1) is second last, tail at (5,1).\n\nPrevious positions: before move, head (3,3), body (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)\n\nAfter moving head to (3,4), new head (3,4), then body: (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), and tail (5,1) removed, so new tail is (4,1)? Positions: the last body segment was (5,1), so when tail moves, (5,1) is removed, and the new tail is the previous second last, which was (4,1).\n\nList indices: let's say positions 0: head, 1: neck, ..., 18: tail.\n\nAfter move, new position 0: new head, position 1: old head, position 2: old position 1, ..., position 18: old position 17, and old position 18 (tail) removed.\n\nSo here, after move to (3,4): new pos 0: (3,4), 1: (3,3), 2: (3,2), 3: (4,2), 4: (5,2), 5: (5,3), 6: (4,3), 7: (4,4), 8: (4,5), 9: (3,5), 10: (2,5), 11: (1,5), 12: (1,4), 13: (1,3), 14: (1,2), 15: (1,1), 16: (2,1), 17: (3,1), 18: (4,1) — tail at (4,1).\n\n(5,1) is gone.\n\nNow from (3,4), I can move U to (3,5) but (3,5) is at position 9, occupied, not tail, so collision.\n\nMove L to (2,4): (2,4) not occupied, free.\n\nMove R to (4,4): (4,4) is at position 7, occupied, collision.\n\nMove D to (3,3) but reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo only possible move: L to (2,4).\n\nTurn 72: move L to (2,4)\n\nNew head (2,4), dir L.\n\nNew positions: head (2,4), then (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), tail at (4,1) removed, new tail (3,1)? Old tail (4,1) removed, new tail is old position 17, which is (3,1).\n\nPositions: 0: (2,4), 1: (3,4), 2: (3,3), 3: (3,2), 4: (4,2), 5: (5,2), 6: (5,3), 7: (4,3), 8: (4,4), 9: (4,5), 10: (3,5), 11: (2,5), 12: (1,5), 13: (1,4), 14: (1,3), 15: (1,2), 16: (1,1), 17: (2,1), 18: (3,1) — tail at (3,1).\n\n(4,1) gone.\n\nNow from (2,4), I can move to food or other.\n\nFood at (3,6), which is adjacent? (2,4) to (3,6) not adjacent; adjacent cells are (2,5), (2,3), (1,4), (3,4).\n\n(3,4) is now body, so cannot move there.\n\n(2,5): is it occupied? Position 11 is (2,5), occupied.\n\n(2,3): not occupied, free.\n\n(1,4): position 13 is (1,4), occupied.\n\nSo possible moves from (2,4) dir L: can move U to (2,5), but occupied, death.\n\nD to (2,3), free.\n\nL to (1,4), occupied, death.\n\nR to (3,4), occupied, death.\n\nCurrent dir is L, so moving U, D, L, R.\n\nU to (2,5): occupied, collision.\n\nD to (2,3): free.\n\nL to (1,4): occupied, collision.\n\nR to (3,4): occupied, collision.\n\nSo only possible move is D to (2,3).\n\nTurn 73: move D to (2,3)\n\nNew head (2,3), dir D (since moved down).\n\nPositions: head (2,3), then (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), tail at (3,1) removed, new tail (2,1).\n\nOld tail (3,1) removed, new tail old position 17, (2,1).\n\nPositions: 0: (2,3), 1: (2,4), 2: (3,4), 3: (3,3), 4: (3,2), 5: (4,2), 6: (5,2), 7: (5,3), 8: (4,3), 9: (4,4), 10: (4,5), 11: (3,5), 12: (2,5), 13: (1,5), 14: (1,4), 15: (1,3), 16: (1,2), 17: (1,1), 18: (2,1) — tail at (2,1).\n\nThis is getting messy, and I'm not closer to the food. Also, the snake is trapped in a corner.\n\nFrom the beginning, moving up might not be good because it leads to dead end.\n\nNow, the other option at turn 71: move L to (2,2)\n\nTurn 71: move L to (2,2)\n\nNew head (2,2), dir L.\n\nNew positions: head (2,2), then (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) — tail at (5,1), (6,1) gone.\n\n(2,2) was not occupied, so ok.\n\nFrom (2,2), head dir L.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,3), D to (2,1), L to (1,2), R to (3,2) but reverse? Current dir L, moving R is right, opposite to left, so instant reverse, not allowed. Cannot move R.\n\nU to (2,3): (2,3) not occupied? Currently, after move, positions: head (2,2), body (3,2), etc., (2,3) not in list, so free.\n\nD to (2,1): (2,1) is occupied, position, say, 15: (2,1), occupied, not tail, collision.\n\nL to (1,2): (1,2) is occupied, position 12: (1,2), occupied, collision.\n\nSo only possible move: U to (2,3).\n\nTurn 71: move L to (2,2)\n\nThen turn 72: from (2,2) dir L, only U to (2,3) possible.\n\nNew head (2,3), dir U (since moved up).\n\nPositions: head (2,3), then (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), tail at (5,1) removed, new tail (4,1).\n\nPositions: 0: (2,3), 1: (2,2), 2: (3,2), 3: (4,2), 4: (5,2), 5: (5,3), 6: (4,3), 7: (4,4), 8: (4,5), 9: (3,5), 10: (2,5), 11: (1,5), 12: (1,4), 13: (1,3), 14: (1,2), 15: (1,1), 16: (2,1), 17: (3,1), 18: (4,1) — tail at (4,1).\n\nFrom (2,3), dir U, can move U to (2,4), or L to (1,3), or R to (3,3), or D to (2,2) but reverse, not allowed.\n\nU to (2,4): (2,4) not occupied, free.\n\nL to (1,3): (1,3) is occupied, position 13, collision.\n\nR to (3,3): (3,3) not occupied? Not in positions, so free.\n\nD not allowed.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (2,4) or R to (3,3).\n\nIf I move U to (2,4), then from there I can go to (2,5) or (1,4) etc., but (2,5) is occupied, (1,4) occupied, so might be trapped.\n\nMove R to (3,3).\n\nTurn 72: move R to (3,3)\n\nNew head (3,3), dir R.\n\nPositions: head (3,3), then (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), tail at (4,1) removed, new tail (3,1).\n\nPositions: 0: (3,3), 1: (2,3), 2: (2,2), 3: (3,2), 4: (4,2), 5: (5,2), 6: (5,3), 7: (4,3), 8: (4,4), 9: (4,5), 10: (3,5), 11: (2,5), 12: (1,5), 13: (1,4), 14: (1,3), 15: (1,2), 16: (1,1), 17: (2,1), 18: (3,1) — tail at (3,1).\n\nFrom (3,3), dir R, can move U to (3,4), L to (2,3) but reverse? Current dir R, moving L is left, opposite, not allowed. R to (4,3), D to (3,2), U to (3,4).\n\nU to (3,4): free.\n\nR to (4,3): (4,3) is occupied, position 7, collision.\n\nD to (3,2): (3,2) is occupied, position 3, collision.\n\nL not allowed.\n\nSo only possible move: U to (3,4).\n\nTurn 73: move U to (3,4)\n\nNew head (3,4), dir U.\n\nPositions: head (3,4), then (3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), tail at (3,1) removed, new tail (2,1).\n\nPositions: 0: (3,4), 1: (3,3), 2: (2,3), 3: (2,2), 4: (3,2), 5: (4,2), 6: (5,2), 7: (5,3), 8: (4,3), 9: (4,4), 10: (4,5), 11: (3,5), 12: (2,5), 13: (1,5), 14: (1,4), 15: (1,3), 16: (1,2), 17: (1,1), 18: (2,1) — tail at (2,1).\n\nFrom (3,4), dir U, can move U to (3,5), but (3,5) occupied, position 11, collision.\n\nL to (2,4), free.\n\nR to (4,4), occupied, position 9, collision.\n\nD not allowed.\n\nSo only L to (2,4).\n\nTurn 74: move L to (2,4)\n\nAnd so on, similar to before, I end up at (2,4) with limited moves.\n\nIn both cases, by moving up or left initially, I get stuck in the top-left area and can't reach the food at (3,6) easily.\n\nI need a different strategy to free up the body or move towards the food.\n\nNotice that the food at (3,6) is above, but (3,5) is occupied, so I need to move the body away from (3,5) so that I can access (3,6).\n\nSimilarly, the internal obstacle at (4,6) is there, so (4,6) is blocked.\n\nAlso, the snake is long, so I need to avoid trapping myself.\n\nPerhaps I should move down or something, but from (3,2), down is not possible, as (3,1) is occupied.\n\nOnly U or L are possible.\n\nBut both seem to lead to dead ends.\n\nAnother idea: since the tail is at (6,1), and it's moving, I can try to follow the tail or create space.\n\nLet's look at the grid map.\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nRows y=0 to 7, x=0 to 7.\n\nWalls at borders and (4,6).\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (3,2)\n\nBody: (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) tail.\n\nFood at (3,6)\n\nNow, the area around (3,2): (3,3) free, (2,2) free, (3,1) occupied, (4,2) occupied.\n\nTo reach (3,6), I need to go via (4,3) or (2,3) etc., but (4,3) is occupied.\n\n(4,3) is part of body.\n\nPerhaps I can move to (3,3), then to (4,3) but it's occupied, or to (2,3).\n\n(2,3) is free? Current state, (2,3) not occupied.\n\nFrom (3,2), move U to (3,3), then from (3,3), I can move L to (2,3) as we saw earlier.\n\nThen from (2,3), I can move to (2,4) or (1,3) etc.\n\nBut (2,4) is free, (1,3) occupied.\n\nSo move to (2,4).\n\nThen from (2,4), I can move U to (2,5) but occupied, or D to (2,3) but might be reverse, or L to (1,4) occupied, R to (3,4) free.\n\nFrom (2,4), if I move R to (3,4), then to (3,5) occupied, etc.\n\nSame problem.\n\nPerhaps I can move down to free the tail area.\n\nBut from (3,2), I can only go U or L.\n\nAt turn 71, move L to (2,2), then U to (2,3), then from (2,3), I can move R to (3,3) as before.\n\nBut then from (3,3) to (3,4), then to (2,4) or something.\n\nBut still not to the food.\n\nThe food at (3,6) has life span 9, so I have until turn 79 to eat it. Turn 71 now, so 8 turns left? Turn 71: life span 9, turn 72:8, ..., turn 79:1, so on turn 79, it can be eaten, after that gone.\n\nSo I have time.\n\nBut the snake is long, and the area is cramped.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (4,6) is a wall, so (4,6) is blocked.\n\nAlso, (3,6) is adjacent to (3,5), (4,6), (2,6), (3,7).\n\n(3,7) is y=7, which is wall, since y=7 is border wall.\n\n(4,6) is wall.\n\n(2,6) might be free, but (2,6) is at x=2,y=6, not occupied, not wall except borders.\n\nBorders are x=0,7 or y=0,7, so (2,6) is not border, not internal obstacle, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) is food.\n\nTo eat (3,6), I can move to it from (2,6), (3,5), or (4,6), but (4,6) is wall, so only from (2,6) or (3,5) or (3,7) but (3,7) wall.\n\nSo only from (2,6) or (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is currently occupied, so I need it to be free when I want to move to (3,6).\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) is free.\n\nSo I can approach from the left, from (2,6).\n\nBut to get to (2,6), I need to go to (2,5) or (1,6) or (2,7), but (2,7) wall, (1,6) might be free.\n\n(1,6) is x=1,y=6, not border, not obstacle, free.\n\nBut (2,5) is occupied.\n\nSo I need to free up (2,5) or go via (1,6).\n\nFirst, I need to move the snake to the top area.\n\nLet's list free cells near the food.\n\nAround (3,6): (3,5) occupied, (3,7) wall, (4,6) wall, (2,6) free, (3,6) food.\n\nAlso (4,5) occupied, (4,6) wall, (2,5) occupied, (1,6) free, etc.\n\nTo reach (2,6), I can go from (2,5) when it's free, or from (1,6), or from (2,7) impossible, or from (3,6) but that's the food.\n\nSo from (1,6) or (2,5) or (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is occupied.\n\nNow, the tail is at (6,1), moving north, I think.\n\nAs the snake moves, the tail will move, so some cells will be freed.\n\nFor example, the tail is at (6,1), and if the snake moves in a way that the tail moves, (6,1) is freed, then (5,1) might be freed later, etc.\n\nBut to free (2,5) or (3,5), it will take many moves because they are far from the tail.\n\nThe distance from head to (3,5) is short, but from tail to (3,5) is long.\n\nPositions: head at (3,2), (3,5) is at position 7 in the list, so 7 segments away, meaning when the head moves 7 steps, the body at (3,5) will move or be freed.\n\nThe cell (3,5) will be freed when the tail has moved enough that the segment at (3,5) becomes the tail and moves away.\n\nCurrently, (3,5) is position 7 from head, or index 7.\n\nTotal segments 19, so (3,5) is the 8th segment? Index from head: 0 head, 1 (4,2), 2 (5,2), 3 (5,3), 4 (4,3), 5 (4,4), 6 (4,5), 7 (3,5), so (3,5) is index 7.\n\nThe tail is index 18.\n\nTo free the cell at (3,5), it needs to be the tail, so when index 7 becomes the tail, which will take 11 moves, since 18-7=11, after 11 moves, the current index 7 will be the tail.\n\nSimilarly for other cells.\n\nFor example, after k moves, the cell that was at position i will be at position i-k for i-k >=0, or gone.\n\nThe cell (3,5) will be occupied until it becomes the tail and moves away.\n\nIt will be the tail after 11 moves, and on the 12th move, it moves away.\n\nSo after 12 moves, (3,5) is free.\n\nSimilarly, for (2,5), index 8, (2,5) is at index 8, tail index 18, so after 10 moves, it is tail, after 11 moves free.\n\nBut the snake is moving, so it's not static.\n\nBut roughly, it will take about 10-12 turns to free the area around (3,5).\n\nBut the food at (3,6) has life span 9, so at turn 71+9=80, it disappears, but can be eaten up to turn 79.\n\nTurn 71: life span 9, so available for 9 turns, from turn 71 to 79.\n\nAfter 12 turns, it's turn 83, which is after turn 79, so the food will be gone before (3,5) is free, if the snake doesn't move towards it.\n\nBut I can approach from (2,6) or other ways.\n\n(2,6) is free now, so I can go to (2,6) and then to (3,6).\n\nFrom current position, how to get to (2,6).\n\n(2,6) is at (2,6).\n\nFrom (3,2), I can go to (2,2), then to (2,3), then to (2,4), then to (2,5) but (2,5) occupied, so I need to go to (2,4), then to (1,5) or (1,4) but occupied, or to (3,4) etc.\n\nFrom (2,4), I can go to (2,5) only when it's free, which will take time.\n\nLet's estimate when (2,5) is free.\n\n(2,5) is index 10 in the list? Positions: 0 (3,2), 1 (4,2), 2 (5,2), 3 (5,3), 4 (4,3), 5 (4,4), 6 (4,5), 7 (3,5), 8 (2,5), 9 (1,5), etc.\n\nSo (2,5) is index 8.\n\nTail index 18.\n\nIndex 8 will be tail after 10 moves, free after 11 moves.\n\nAfter 11 moves, turn 71+11=82, which is after turn 79, so food gone.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) index 7, tail after 11 moves, free after 12 moves, turn 83, too late.\n\n(1,6) is free, so I can go to (1,6) then to (2,6) then to (3,6).\n\nFrom (1,6) to (3,6) not adjacent, so from (1,6) to (2,6) to (3,6).\n\n(2,6) is free.\n\nSo if I can reach (1,6) or (2,6).\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), free.\n\nHow to get to (1,6) from current position.\n\nFrom (3,2), I can go left to (2,2), then to (2,3), then to (1,3) but (1,3) occupied, or to (2,4), etc.\n\nFrom (2,2), I can go to (2,3), then from (2,3) to (2,4), then from (2,4) to (1,4) but (1,4) occupied, or to (2,5) occupied, or to (3,4) free.\n\nFrom (3,4) to (3,5) occupied, etc.\n\nTo reach (1,6), I need to go up from the left side.\n\nFor example, from (2,2) to (2,3), then to (2,4), then from (2,4) to (1,4) but occupied, so not possible.\n\nFrom (1,2) or (1,1) but they are occupied.\n\n(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) are all occupied, so the left column is blocked by the snake.\n\nSo I cannot reach (1,6) directly because the path is blocked.\n\nThe only way is to free the left side by moving the snake.\n\nBut that will take many turns, and the food will expire.\n\nPerhaps I should give up on this food and focus on survival, but the problem says to maximize score, and this is the only food, so I should try to eat it.\n\nBut with the current position, it seems difficult to reach (3,6) within 9 turns.\n\nLet's see if there is a path.\n\nFor example, from (3,2) move U to (3,3)\n\nThen from (3,3) move L to (2,3)\n\nThen from (2,3) move U to (2,4)  -- assuming (2,4) free, which it is at that time.\n\nThen from (2,4) I can only move D to (2,3) but reverse, or L to (1,4) occupied, U to (2,5) occupied, R to (3,4) free.\n\nSo move R to (3,4)\n\nThen from (3,4) move L to (2,4) but might be reverse, or U to (3,5) occupied, R to (4,4) occupied, D to (3,3) occupied or reverse.\n\nFrom (3,4) dir U, as earlier, only L or R, but R occupied, so only L to (2,4), but (2,4) is previous position, so moving to (2,4) from (3,4) would be to a body cell, collision, because after moving to (3,4), (2,4) is body.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAfter move to (3,4), positions include (2,4) as body, so moving back to (2,4) is collision.\n\nSo from (3,4), only possible move is to (2,4) but it's occupied, or to (3,5) occupied, or to (4,4) occupied, or to (3,3) reverse, so no safe move, death.\n\nSimilarly, in other paths, I get stuck.\n\nAt turn 71, from (3,2), if I move U to (3,3), then from (3,3), I can move R to (4,3) but (4,3) is occupied, so not possible, or L to (2,3), or U to (3,4).\n\nIf I move U to (3,4) directly from (3,3)? From (3,3) to (3,4) is possible if free.\n\nBut from (3,3), after moving to (3,3), (3,4) is free, so move U to (3,4).\n\nThen at (3,4), as before, only can move L to (2,4), but then from (2,4), only D to (2,3), then from (2,3), can move to (2,2) or (2,4) or (1,3) or (3,3), but many occupied.\n\nBut from (2,3), if I move D to (2,2), etc., but I'm moving away from the food.\n\nAnd eventually, I might free some cells, but it will take time.\n\nFor example, after moving down, the tail at (6,1) will move, and cells are freed, but the food will be gone.\n\nPerhaps it's not possible to eat this food within the time, so I should avoid it and survive for future food.\n\nBut the state only shows this food, so maybe no other food, or it might spawn later, but the input doesn't say, so I think only this food is present.\n\nThe food positions are given, only one.\n\nSo I need to eat it or not.\n\nBut if I can't eat it, I should just survive.\n\nBut the goal is to maximize score, so eating food is good, but survival is priority.\n\nIn this case, moving up or left might lead to death, as in the simulation.\n\nAt turn 71, both moves seem risky.\n\nAnother idea: move left to (2,2), then from (2,2), only U to (2,3), then from (2,3), I can move R to (3,3) if free, which it is, then to (3,4), then to (2,4), then to (2,3) but occupied, etc.\n\nSame as before.\n\nPerhaps I can move down when possible, but from (3,2), down is not possible.\n\nAfter moving left to (2,2), then to (2,3), then from (2,3), I can move D to (2,2) but reverse, not allowed, or to (2,4), or to (1,3) occupied, or to (3,3).\n\nMove to (2,4), then from (2,4) to (2,3) reverse or to (2,5) occupied or to (1,4) occupied or to (3,4) free.\n\nMove to (3,4), then from (3,4) to (3,5) occupied or to (2,4) occupied or to (4,4) occupied or to (3,3) reverse.\n\nNo move, death.\n\nSo it seems that in all cases, within a few moves, I have no safe move and die.\n\nBut that can't be right; there must be a way.\n\nLet's list all possible moves at each step.\n\nAt turn 71: from (3,2) dir L, possible actions: U or L.\n\nIf U to (3,3), new dir U.\n\nThen at (3,3), possible moves: U to (3,4), L to (2,3), R to (4,3) occupied, D reverse not allowed. So U or L.\n\nIf I move U to (3,4), new dir U.\n\nAt (3,4), possible moves: U to (3,5) occupied, L to (2,4), R to (4,4) occupied, D reverse not allowed. So only L to (2,4) if free.\n\n(2,4) free, so move L to (2,4), new dir L.\n\nAt (2,4), possible moves: U to (2,5) occupied, D to (2,3), L to (1,4) occupied, R to (3,4) occupied. So only D to (2,3), new dir D.\n\nAt (2,3), possible moves: U to (2,4) occupied, D to (2,2), L to (1,3) occupied, R to (3,3) occupied. So only D to (2,2), new dir D.\n\nAt (2,2), possible moves: U to (2,3) occupied, D to (2,1) occupied, L to (1,2) occupied, R to (3,2) occupied. All directions occupied or reverse, no move, death.\n\nSimilarly, if at (3,3) I move L to (2,3) instead of U.\n\nTurn 71: U to (3,3)\n\nTurn 72: L to (2,3), new dir L.\n\nAt (2,3), possible moves: U to (2,4), D to (2,2), L to (1,3) occupied, R to (3,3) occupied. So U or D.\n\nIf U to (2,4), new dir U.\n\nThen same as above, to death.\n\nIf D to (2,2), new dir D.\n\nAt (2,2), as above, no move, death.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 71 I move L to (2,2).\n\nTurn 71: L to (2,2), new dir L.\n\nAt (2,2), possible moves: U to (2,3), D to (2,1) occupied, L to (1,2) occupied, R reverse not allowed. So only U to (2,3), new dir U.\n\nAt (2,3), possible moves: U to (2,4), L to (1,3) occupied, R to (3,3), D reverse not allowed. So U or R.\n\nIf U to (2,4), new dir U.\n\nThen to (2,4), as before, only D to (2,3), then to death.\n\nIf R to (3,3), new dir R.\n\nAt (3,3), possible moves: U to (3,4), L reverse not allowed, R to (4,3) occupied, D to (3,2) occupied.

Positions: 0: (2,2), 1: (2,3), 2: (2,4), 3: (3,4), 4: (3,3), 5: (3,2), 6: (4,2), 7: (5,2), 8: (5,3), 9: (4,3), 10: (4,4), 11: (4,5), 12: (3,5), 13: (2,5), 14: (1,5), 15: (1,4), 16: (1,3), 17: (1,2), 18: (1,1) tail.\n\nU to (2,3) occupied, D to (2,1) not in positions, (2,1) is not occupied now?

Position D would be (2,1), which is not in the positions, so free.\n\nL to (1,2) occupied (position 17), R to (3,2) occupied (position 5).\n\nSo at (2,2), I can move D to (2,1), since (2,1) is free.\n\nThen not dead yet.\n\nTurn 75: move D to (2,1)\n\nNew head (2,1), dir D.\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut this is away from the food, and the food will expire soon.\n\nSimilarly, in other paths, I can survive longer but not reach the food.\n\nSince I can't reach the food in time, I should just focus on survival and avoid dying immediately.\n\nAt turn 71, both U and L are possible, but both lead to potential death soon, but with U, I might survive a bit longer.\n\nIn the U path, I can go to (3,3), then to (2,3), then to (2,4), etc., and down to (2,1), but it's not towards the food.\n\nPerhaps I should choose L at turn 71 to (2,2), then U to (2,3), then R to (3,3), then U to (3,4), then L to (2,4), then D to (2,3), then I can move to (2,2) or other.\n\nBut from (2,3) after moving down, I can move to (2,2) if free.\n\nBut it's messy, and the food is not reached.\n\nSince the food is only 4 cells away in manhattan distance, but with the body in the way, it's blocked.\n\nI think it's impossible to eat this food within the life span with the current snake position, so I should ignore it and just survive as long as possible.\n\nBut the problem says to maximize score, so eating food is good, but if I can't, survival is key.\n\nPerhaps there is a way.\n\nAnother thought: the food at (3,6) might be under the body, but in this case, it's not; it's free.\n\nOr perhaps I can move to (4,5) or something.\n\nLet's list the cells around.\n\nPerhaps from current position, move U to (3,3), then from (3,3) move U to (3,4), then from (3,4) move L to (2,4), then from (2,4) move U but (2,5) occupied, so move D to (2,3), then from (2,3) move R to (3,3) but occupied, or D to (2,2), etc.\n\nI think I have to accept that I can't eat the food and just make moves to survive.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe output format is to list actions for turns t1, t1+1, etc., but I need to specify how many turns? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should plan for at least 5 turns.\n\nBut in this case, for turn 71, I can choose U or L.\n\nLet's assume I choose U at turn 71 to (3,3)\n\nThen at turn 72, from (3,3) move L to (2,3) or U to (3,4). Let's say move U to (3,4)\n\nThen at turn 73, from (3,4) move L to (2,4)\n\nThen at turn 74, from (2,4) move D to (2,3)\n\nThen at turn 75, from (2,3) move D to (2,2)\n\nThen at turn 76, from (2,2) move D to (2,1) if free, which it is at that time, as in earlier simulation.\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut this is not towards the food.\n\nSince the food is at (3,6), and I have 9 turns, but with the snake moving slowly, I can't reach it.\n\nDistance: from (3,2) to (3,6) is 4 steps up, but (3,5) blocked, so I need to go around, which is longer.\n\nFor example, via (4,2) but occupied, or via (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) but occupied, or (1,6), but blocked.\n\nSo minimum path length is at least 5 or 6, but with the body, it might not be possible.\n\nI think I should give up on the food and focus on survival.\n\nFor the answer, I'll choose to move U at turn 71, then for subsequent turns, based on the state.\n\nBut since I need to output a sequence, I'll plan for 5 turns.\n\nTurn 71: move U to (3,3)\n\nTurn 72: from (3,3) move U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 73: from (3,4) move L to (2,4)\n\nTurn 74: from (2,4) move D to (2,3)\n\nTurn 75: from (2,3) move D to (2,2)\n\nThen at turn 76, from (2,2) move D to (2,1), etc.\n\nBut this is just one possibility.\n\nPerhaps from turn 71, move L to (2,2), then U to (2,3), then R to (3,3), then U to (3,4), then L to (2,4), same as above.\n\nI think for the sake of answering, I'll provide a sequence.\n\nBut the food has value 1, and life span 9, so if I can eat it, I should, but I can't see a way.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the head can move to the tail cell when the tail moves, but here the tail is far.\n\nOr in this case, the tail is at (6,1), and I am at (3,2), so not adjacent.\n\nAlso, the rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills, but here no food on tail.\n\nSo not relevant.\n\nI think I have to conclude that eating the food is not feasible, so I should avoid risks and survive.\n\nSo for turn 71, I'll choose to move U to (3,3), as it might keep me away from immediate death longer.\n\nThen for the next turns, I'll assume moves that avoid collision.\n\nBut for the output, I need to list actions.\n\nLet's provide a sequence for 5 turns.\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nTurn 72: U (from (3,3) to (3,4))\n\nTurn 73: L (from (3,4) to (2,4))\n\nTurn 74: D (from (2,4) to (2,3))\n\nTurn 75: D (from (2,3) to (2,2))\n\nThen at turn 76, from (2,2) move D to (2,1), etc.\n\nBut at turn 75, at (2,2), I can move D to (2,1) if free, which it is at that time.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 75, after moving to (2,2), the state has (2,1) free, so move D.\n\nBut for 5 turns, up to turn 75.\n\nThe current turn is t1=71, so actions for turn 71 to, say, turn 75 or 76.\n\nBut the food life span is 9 turns, so by turn 80 it's gone, but in 5 turns, I can't reach it anyway.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n\nPerhaps there is a better move.\n\nWhat if at turn 71, I move L to (2,2), then at turn 72, move U to (2,3), then at turn 73, move R to (3,3), then at turn 74, move U to (3,4), then at turn 75, move L to (2,4), same as before.\n\nNo difference.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nFor the answer, I'll box the sequence.\n\nBut let's write it.\n</think>\nGiven the current state at turn 71, the snake must prioritize long-term survival while attempting to maximize score by eating the positive food at (3,6) with a value of +1 and a remaining life span of 9 turns (disappearing after turn 79). However, the snake's position and body layout create a high risk of collision if moving directly toward the food, as the path is blocked by the body segment at (3,5). Additionally, the snake is long (19 segments), and the grid has limited space due to walls and the internal obstacle at (4,6). After simulating multiple moves ahead, it is determined that reaching the food within its life span is not feasible without significant risk of death. Therefore, the primary focus is on avoiding immediate collisions and surviving as long as possible to await new food spawns.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Immediate Moves at Turn 71**: The snake head is at (3,2) with direction left (L). Possible moves are up (U) to (3,3) or left (L) to (2,2), as down (D) leads to body collision at (3,1) and right (R) is an instant reverse. Both U and L are evaluated for survival potential.\n- **Food Access**: The food at (3,6) is 4 cells away (Manhattan distance), but the direct path is blocked by (3,5). Access requires freeing (3,5) or approaching via (2,6), but (3,5) will not free until after turn 82 (due to distance from tail), which is after the food expires. Moving toward the food now risks entrapment.\n- **Collision Risks**: Moving up or left initially leads to dead ends within 5-6 turns if not managed carefully. Simulations show that sequences starting with U or L can be extended by moving downward when possible to open space near (2,1).\n- **5+ Turn Simulation**: A sequence of moves is planned for 6 turns (turns 71-76) to avoid collisions and maintain flexibility:\n  - **Turn 71: Move U to (3,3)** – Avoids the left move which may lead to faster entrapment. U opens a path to explore the upper area while staying clear of the dense body cluster.\n  - **Turn 72: Move U to (3,4)** – Continues upward; (3,4) is free and not blocked by body or walls.\n  - **Turn 73: Move L to (2,4)** – Moves left to avoid the occupied (3,5) and (4,4). (2,4) is free and starts shifting away from the body.\n  - **Turn 74: Move D to (2,3)** – Moves down as (2,5) is occupied and (2,3) is free, creating distance from the top row.\n  - **Turn 75: Move D to (2,2)** – Moves down to (2,2), which is free at this point (tail movement frees cells).\n  - **Turn 76: Move D to (2,1)** – Moves down to (2,1), which is free after tail movement, opening space to potentially move right or down in future turns.\n- **Survival Focus**: This sequence keeps the snake alive for at least 6 turns, with (2,1) providing options to move to (3,1) or (2,0) (but y=0 is a wall, so (3,1) is the likely next move if free). The food is not eaten, but survival allows for future opportunities.\n\n### Action Sequence (Turns 71-76):\nThe actions below ensure no collisions or reversals, with the snake surviving through turn 76.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 71: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 72: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 73: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 74: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 75: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 76: D (down)\n}",

So it's positive food, +1 point, and it disappears after 8 turns, including this turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so it has 8 turns left starting from now.\n\nCurrent turn is 72, so food will disappear after turn 72 + 7 = 79? Let's see: life span 8, decreases each turn including current. So at turn 72, life span is 8; after turn 72, it becomes 7; after turn 73, it becomes 6, and so on, until after turn 79 it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten until turn 79 inclusive? No.\n\nIf life span is N at turn t, it decreases after each turn. So at the start of turn t, life span is N. After the turn, it decreases by 1. So if not eaten, after turn t, life span becomes N-1.\n\nFor eating, if the head moves onto the food cell during a turn, it's eaten.\n\nSo for food with life span L at turn T, it can be eaten on turn T, T+1, ..., up to turn T + L - 1, because on turn T + L, after the turn, life span would be 0, so it disappears before that turn or after? I need to clarify.\n\nTypically, in such games, the food is present at the beginning of the turn and can be eaten during that turn. After the turn, if not eaten, life span decreases.\n\nSo for this food: at turn 72, life span 8. It can be eaten on turns 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, and 79? Turn 72: life span 8, eaten or not, after turn 72, if not eaten, life span becomes 7.\n\nAfter turn 73, if not eaten, life span 6, and so on, down to after turn 79, if not eaten, life span becomes 0 and it disappears. So it can be eaten on any turn from 72 to 79 inclusive. That's 8 possible turns: 72 to 79 is 8 turns.\n\nTurn 72: life span 8, present\n\nAfter turn 72 (if not eaten): life span 7\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 78 (if not eaten): life span 1\n\nAfter turn 79 (if not eaten): life span 0, disappears. So on turn 79, it can still be eaten if present at start of turn.\n\nYes, so from turn 72 to 79 inclusive.\n\nNow, snake head is at (3,3), direction Up. So from (3,3), possible moves: Up to (3,4), Down to (3,2), Left to (2,3), Right to (4,3). But we have to consider the body and walls.\n\nFirst, let's list all snake positions to see where the body is.\n\nSnake positions: [(3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)]\n\nLet me parse this list:\n\n- Head: (3,3)\n\n- Segment 1: (3,2)  // directly below head\n\n- Segment 2: (4,2)\n\n- Segment 3: (5,2)\n\n- Segment 4: (5,3)\n\n- Segment 5: (4,3)  // this is left of head? Head is (3,3), (4,3) is right\n\n- Segment 6: (4,4)\n\n- Segment 7: (4,5)\n\n- Segment 8: (3,5)\n\n- Segment 9: (2,5)\n\n- Segment 10: (1,5)\n\n- Segment 11: (1,4)\n\n- Segment 12: (1,3)\n\n- Segment 13: (1,2)\n\n- Segment 14: (1,1)\n\n- Segment 15: (2,1)\n\n- Segment 16: (3,1)\n\n- Segment 17: (4,1)\n\n- Segment 18: (5,1)\n\nThe snake has 19 segments? Let's count: positions from index 0 to 18, that's 19 cells.\n\nHead at (3,3), tail at (5,1).\n\nNow, direction is Up, so last move was from (3,2) to (3,3), I assume? Positions: head (3,3), then (3,2), so yes, moved Up to (3,3).\n\nNow, possible moves from (3,3):\n\n- Up: to (3,4)\n\n- Down: to (3,2) but (3,2) is occupied by the body, segment 1. But in snake, moving into the tail is sometimes allowed because the tail moves, but we have to be careful.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, moving to a body segment is deadly unless it's the tail and we're moving into it, but after move, tail moves, so no collision.\n\nSpecifically: if head moves to a cell occupied by any body segment except the current tail, it collides. If it moves to the current tail, and since tail moves, it might be ok, but we have to check if after move, the tail has moved, so head is not colliding with the new tail position.\n\nStandard snake: when head moves, if it moves to a cell that will be free after the tail moves, it's ok. But if it moves to a body cell that is not the tail, it dies.\n\nIn this case, from (3,3), moving Down to (3,2): (3,2) is the first body segment, which is not the tail. The tail is at (5,1). So (3,2) is part of the body, not tail, so moving Down to (3,2) would cause collision and death.\n\nSimilarly, moving Left to (2,3): is (2,3) occupied? Let's see the positions: (1,3) is segment 12, (1,2) is 13, (1,1) is 14, (2,1) is 15, (3,1) is 16, etc. What about (2,3)? Not in the list: positions are (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1). So (2,3) is not listed, so it should be free? Let's list all occupied cells.\n\nOccupied cells: from snake:\n\n(3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)\n\nNow, (2,3): not in this list, so free.\n\n(2,2): not listed, free.\n\n(2,4): not listed, free.\n\n(3,4): not listed, free? Positions: (4,4) is segment 6, but (3,4) not listed, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) is segment 5, but (3,3) is head.\n\nLet's make a grid mentally.\n\nGrid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, but walls at borders, so (1,1) to (6,6) playable, except internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is wall.\n\nNow, cells:\n\nRow y=6: (1,6) to (6,6), but (4,6) is wall, and borders x=0,7 y=0,7 walls, but playable from 1 to 6.\n\n(1,6): is it occupied? Snake has (1,5), (2,5), etc, not (1,6). So (1,6) free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) wall, (5,6), (6,6) free.\n\nBut (3,6) is the food position.\n\nBack to head at (3,3).\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Up: to (3,4) - is this free? Positions: (3,4) not listed, so yes, free.\n\n- Down: to (3,2) - occupied by segment 1, which is body, not tail, so collision, invalid.\n\n- Left: to (2,3) - not listed, free.\n\n- Right: to (4,3) - (4,3) is segment 5 in the list, which is body, not tail, so occupied, collision if move there.\n\nSegment 5 is (4,3), which is directly right of head.\n\nSo from (3,3), moving Right to (4,3) would hit the body.\n\nSimilarly, Down to (3,2) hits body.\n\nSo only possible moves: Up to (3,4) or Left to (2,3).\n\nAlso, cannot move opposite direction: current direction is Up, so cannot move Down, but Down is invalid anyway.\n\nOpposite of Up is Down, which is invalid, so no issue.\n\nSo possible actions: U or L.\n\nNow, food is at (3,6), which is above, but with internal wall at (4,6), and (3,6) is y=6, which is top row, but not wall, since walls are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (3,6) is playable.\n\ny=6 is not y=7, so ok.\n\nNow, I need to think multiple turns ahead. The goal is to maximize score, so eat positive food while avoiding risks, and prioritize long-term survival.\n\nThere's only one food now, at (3,6), value +1.\n\nBut it's at (3,6), and head at (3,3), so same column, but with obstacles.\n\nPath to food: from (3,3) to (3,6), but directly up: (3,4), (3,5), (3,6).\n\nNow, (3,4) is free, as we saw.\n\n(3,5): is it occupied? Snake has (3,5) as segment 8? Positions: segment 8 is (3,5), yes, in the list: (4,5), (3,5), etc. (3,5) is occupied by segment 8.\n\nSegment 8: (3,5)\n\nSo (3,5) is occupied.\n\nTherefore, from (3,3), moving Up to (3,4) is possible, but then from there, to (3,5) is occupied, so cannot go directly up to (3,6).\n\n(3,6) is food, but to eat it, need to reach it.\n\nCurrently, (3,5) is occupied, so the snake body is there.\n\nRule about food under body: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nIn this case, the food is at (3,6), which is not under body currently? Is (3,6) occupied by snake? Positions: not listed, so not occupied, so it's free, not under body.\n\nOnly if food was under body, but here it's not, so we can eat it normally if head moves there.\n\nBut to move to (3,6), need to go through (3,5) or around, but (3,5) is occupied, so cannot go directly.\n\nSo head at (3,3), options: U to (3,4) or L to (2,3).\n\nNow, if I go Up to (3,4), then head at (3,4).\n\nThen possible moves from (3,4): U, D, L, R.\n\n- U to (3,5): but (3,5) is occupied by segment 8, which is body, not tail. Tail is at (5,1), so (3,5) is body, collision.\n\n- D to (3,3): but (3,3) is now the first body segment? After moving to (3,4), the new positions: head moves to (3,4), then body follows: the segment that was at (3,3) moves to where head was? No.\n\nWhen snake moves, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo after moving Up to (3,4):\n\nNew head: (3,4)\n\nThen body: the first body segment was at (3,2), but now it moves to the old head position (3,3)? Let's trace.\n\nCurrent positions before move: head (3,3), then segments: (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), etc.\n\nAfter moving head Up to (3,4):\n\n- New head: (3,4)\n\n- Then the segment that was at (3,3) moves to where? The body segments: the first body segment (index 1) was at (3,2), it moves to the head's old position, which is (3,3).\n\nIn snake movement, when head moves to a new cell, the tail end is removed unless food eaten.\n\nBut here, no food eaten yet.\n\nSo when head moves to (3,4), the new head is (3,4), and the body segments shift: the segment that was behind head, at (3,2), moves to (3,3)? No.\n\nPositions: let's list with indices.\n\nIndex 0: head (3,3)\n\nIndex 1: (3,2)\n\nIndex 2: (4,2)\n\nIndex 3: (5,2)\n\nIndex 4: (5,3)\n\nIndex 5: (4,3)\n\nIndex 6: (4,4)\n\nIndex 7: (4,5)\n\nIndex 8: (3,5)\n\nIndex 9: (2,5)\n\nIndex 10: (1,5)\n\nIndex 11: (1,4)\n\nIndex 12: (1,3)\n\nIndex 13: (1,2)\n\nIndex 14: (1,1)\n\nIndex 15: (2,1)\n\nIndex 16: (3,1)\n\nIndex 17: (4,1)\n\nIndex 18: (5,1)  // tail\n\nAfter moving Up, head to (3,4), so new head (3,4).\n\nThen, the body: index 1 (was (3,2)) moves to the old head position (3,3).\n\nIndex 2 (was (4,2)) moves to index 1's old position (3,2)? No.\n\nStandard: each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the chain.\n\nSo: after head moves to new position, the segment that was at index 1 moves to where index 0 was (old head position).\n\nThe segment that was at index 2 moves to where index 1 was, and so on.\n\nThe last segment, tail, is removed from its position.\n\nSo new positions after move Up to (3,4):\n\n- New index 0 (head): (3,4)\n\n- New index 1: old index 0 position, (3,3)\n\n- New index 2: old index 1 position, (3,2)\n\n- New index 3: old index 2 position, (4,2)\n\n- New index 4: old index 3 position, (5,2)\n\n- New index 5: old index 4 position, (5,3)\n\n- New index 6: old index 5 position, (4,3)\n\n- New index 7: old index 6 position, (4,4)\n\n- New index 8: old index 7 position, (4,5)\n\n- New index 9: old index 8 position, (3,5)\n\n- New index 10: old index 9 position, (2,5)\n\n- New index 11: old index 10 position, (1,5)\n\n- New index 12: old index 11 position, (1,4)\n\n- New index 13: old index 12 position, (1,3)\n\n- New index 14: old index 13 position, (1,2)\n\n- New index 15: old index 14 position, (1,1)\n\n- New index 16: old index 15 position, (2,1)\n\n- New index 17: old index 16 position, (3,1)\n\n- New index 18: old index 17 position, (4,1)  // tail? Old index 17 was (4,1), but now new index 17 is old index 16 position (3,1)? Let's correct.\n\nOld positions:\n\nIndex: 0: (3,3) head\n\n1: (3,2)\n\n2: (4,2)\n\n3: (5,2)\n\n4: (5,3)\n\n5: (4,3)\n\n6: (4,4)\n\n7: (4,5)\n\n8: (3,5)\n\n9: (2,5)\n\n10: (1,5)\n\n11: (1,4)\n\n12: (1,3)\n\n13: (1,2)\n\n14: (1,1)\n\n15: (2,1)\n\n16: (3,1)\n\n17: (4,1)\n\n18: (5,1)  // tail\n\nAfter head moves to (3,4):\n\n- New head: (3,4)\n\n- New body segment 1: position of old index 0, which is (3,3)\n\n- New body segment 2: position of old index 1, which is (3,2)\n\n- New body segment 3: position of old index 2, which is (4,2)\n\n- New body segment 4: position of old index 3, which is (5,2)\n\n- New body segment 5: position of old index 4, which is (5,3)\n\n- New body segment 6: position of old index 5, which is (4,3)\n\n- New body segment 7: position of old index 6, which is (4,4)\n\n- New body segment 8: position of old index 7, which is (4,5)\n\n- New body segment 9: position of old index 8, which is (3,5)\n\n- New body segment 10: position of old index 9, which is (2,5)\n\n- New body segment 11: position of old index 10, which is (1,5)\n\n- New body segment 12: position of old index 11, which is (1,4)\n\n- New body segment 13: position of old index 12, which is (1,3)\n\n- New body segment 14: position of old index 13, which is (1,2)\n\n- New body segment 15: position of old index 14, which is (1,1)\n\n- New body segment 16: position of old index 15, which is (2,1)\n\n- New body segment 17: position of old index 16, which is (3,1)\n\n- New body segment 18: position of old index 17, which is (4,1)  // and the old tail at (5,1) is gone, so no new segment 19, tail is now at (4,1)\n\nThe snake has 19 segments, so when no food eaten, the tail moves off, so new snake has 18 segments? No.\n\nNumber of segments: when head moves to a new cell, if no food eaten, the tail is removed, so the snake length decreases by 0, but the segments shift.\n\nInitially, 19 segments. After moving head to new position, new head, and the last segment (tail) is removed, so the new snake has the same number of segments, but all shifted, with tail at the previous position of the second-to-last segment.\n\nIn this case, old snake: positions 0 to 18, 19 cells.\n\nAfter move: new position 0: new head\n\nNew position 1: old position 0\n\nNew position 2: old position 1\n\n...\n\nNew position 18: old position 17\n\nOld position 18 is not used, so the snake has 18 segments now? But usually, when no food, length decreases? No.\n\nSnake length increases only when food eaten. Otherwise, when moving, the tail end is left, so the snake moves forward, length stays the same.\n\nBut in terms of positions, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail cell is vacated.\n\nThe number of segments: if no food eaten, the snake has the same number of segments, but the positions shift: the head is new, each body segment takes the position of the previous one, and the tail position is removed from the list.\n\nSo from 19 segments, after moving with no food, it becomes 18 segments? That can't be right.\n\nI think I have a confusion.\n\nStandard snake: the snake has a fixed length unless it eats food. When it moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail cell is abandoned, so the snake occupies the new head position and the positions of all body segments except the tail, which is removed.\n\nSo the number of cells occupied decreases only if no food, but the length stays the same? Let's think.\n\nSuppose snake of length L: head and L-1 body segments.\n\nWhen it moves without eating: head moves to new cell, new head position. Then, the body: the segment behind head moves to the old head position, the next moves to the position of the previous segment, and so on, down to the tail: the tail segment moves to the position of the second-to-last segment, and the old tail position is vacated.\n\nSo the snake now occupies: new head position, and the old positions of all segments except the tail. The tail position is lost, but since it moved to the second-to-last, the new tail is at the old position of the second-to-last segment.\n\nThe number of segments remains the same; only the positions change.\n\nFor example, length 3 snake: positions A (head), B, C (tail).\n\nMove head to D: new head D, then B moves to A, C moves to B, and old C vacated. New positions: D (head), A, B (tail). Length still 3.\n\nSimilarly here, with 19 segments, after moving to (3,4) with no food, new head at (3,4), then the body segments: the first body segment moves to (3,3), which was old head, and so on, up to the 18th segment moves to the old position of the 17th segment, and the old tail at (5,1) is vacated.\n\nNew tail is at the old position of the 17th segment, which is (4,1).\n\nFrom earlier: new positions:\n\n- Head: (3,4)\n\n- Seg1: (3,3)  // old head\n\n- Seg2: (3,2)  // old seg1\n\n- Seg3: (4,2)  // old seg2\n\n- Seg4: (5,2)  // old seg3\n\n- Seg5: (5,3)  // old seg4\n\n- Seg6: (4,3)  // old seg5\n\n- Seg7: (4,4)  // old seg6\n\n- Seg8: (4,5)  // old seg7\n\n- Seg9: (3,5)  // old seg8\n\n- Seg10: (2,5)  // old seg9\n\n- Seg11: (1,5)  // old seg10\n\n- Seg12: (1,4)  // old seg11\n\n- Seg13: (1,3)  // old seg12\n\n- Seg14: (1,2)  // old seg13\n\n- Seg15: (1,1)  // old seg14\n\n- Seg16: (2,1)  // old seg15\n\n- Seg17: (3,1)  // old seg16\n\n- Seg18: (4,1)  // old seg17, and old seg18 (5,1) vacated\n\nSo new tail at (4,1).\n\nBack to from (3,4), possible moves:\n\n- Up to (3,5): (3,5) is now occupied by seg9 in new positions, which is body, not tail. Tail is at (4,1), so (3,5) is body, collision if move there.\n\n- Down to (3,3): (3,3) is now seg1, body, not tail, collision.\n\n- Left to (2,4): is (2,4) occupied? New positions: (2,4) not listed, so free.\n\n- Right to (4,4): (4,4) is seg7, body, collision.\n\nSo from (3,4), only possible move is Left to (2,4).\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 72, we move Left to (2,3), let's see what happens.\n\nFirst, at turn 72, head at (3,3), move Left to (2,3).\n\n(2,3) is free, as not occupied.\n\nNew head: (2,3)\n\nThen new positions:\n\n- Head: (2,3)\n\n- Seg1: old head (3,3)\n\n- Seg2: old seg1 (3,2)\n\n- Seg3: old seg2 (4,2)\n\n- Seg4: old seg3 (5,2)\n\n- Seg5: old seg4 (5,3)\n\n- Seg6: old seg5 (4,3)\n\n- Seg7: old seg6 (4,4)\n\n- Seg8: old seg7 (4,5)\n\n- Seg9: old seg8 (3,5)\n\n- Seg10: old seg9 (2,5)\n\n- Seg11: old seg10 (1,5)\n\n- Seg12: old seg11 (1,4)\n\n- Seg13: old seg12 (1,3)\n\n- Seg14: old seg13 (1,2)\n\n- Seg15: old seg14 (1,1)\n\n- Seg16: old seg15 (2,1)\n\n- Seg17: old seg16 (3,1)\n\n- Seg18: old seg17 (4,1)  // tail, old seg18 (5,1) vacated\n\nFrom (2,3), possible moves:\n\n- Up to (2,4): free? (2,4) not in positions, free.\n\n- Down to (2,2): free? (2,2) not occupied, free.\n\n- Left to (1,3): (1,3) is old seg12, but in new positions, (1,3) is seg13? New seg13 is old seg12 position (1,3), so occupied.\n\n- Right to (3,3): (3,3) is seg1, body, collision.\n\nSo from (2,3), possible moves: U to (2,4) or D to (2,2).\n\nNow, back to turn 72, we have two choices: U to (3,4) or L to (2,3).\n\nIf we go U to (3,4), then from there only L to (2,4) is possible, as above.\n\nThen from (2,4), we can go U, D, L, R.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (3,6).\n\nTo eat it, we need to reach (3,6), but (3,5) is currently occupied, and will be for some time.\n\nThe body is at (3,5) and (4,5), etc.\n\nAlso, the food has life span 8, so we have until turn 79 to eat it.\n\nBut we need to plan how to get to (3,6) safely.\n\nMoreover, there might be risks.\n\nAnother thing: the grid has limited space, and the snake is long, 19 segments, in a 6x6 grid, which has 36 cells, but walls and obstacles.\n\nPlayable cells: x1-6, y1-6, except (4,6) wall, so 36 - 1 = 35 cells.\n\nSnake occupies 19, so 16 free cells.\n\nBut many are near the snake.\n\nFree cells: for example, (1,6), (2,6), (3,6) food, (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (4,6) wall, (3,6) food, (2,6), (1,6), and below: (2,4), (2,3) if not occupied, (3,4), (4,4) occupied, etc.\n\nLet's list all free cells to see available space.\n\nOccupied cells: from snake positions:\n\n(3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)\n\nWalls: borders, but not playable, and internal (4,6).\n\nPlayable cells: (1,1) to (6,6) except (4,6).\n\nSo free cells:\n\nRow y=1: (6,1) free, since (5,1) occupied, (6,1) not listed.\n\ny=1: (1,1) occ, (2,1) occ, (3,1) occ, (4,1) occ, (5,1) occ, (6,1) free\n\ny=2: (1,2) occ, (2,2) free? not listed, (3,2) occ, (4,2) occ, (5,2) occ, (6,2) free\n\ny=3: (1,3) occ, (2,3) free, (3,3) occ, (4,3) occ, (5,3) occ, (6,3) free\n\ny=4: (1,4) occ, (2,4) free, (3,4) free, (4,4) occ, (5,4) free? not listed, (6,4) free\n\ny=5: (1,5) occ, (2,5) occ, (3,5) occ, (4,5) occ, (5,5) free, (6,5) free\n\ny=6: (1,6) free, (2,6) free, (3,6) food, (4,6) wall, (5,6) free, (6,6) free\n\nAlso, (5,4) free, (5,5) free, etc.\n\nSo free cells: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (3,6) food, (2,6), (1,6), (2,4), (3,4), (2,3), and (5,4) is free, (5,5) free.\n\n(5,4) not occupied, yes.\n\nNow, food at (3,6).\n\nTo reach (3,6), we need to go to (3,5) or (2,6) or (4,6) but (4,6) wall, or (3,6) directly from below, but (3,5) is occupied.\n\n(3,5) is occupied by the snake, and it's body, not tail.\n\nSo the only way to eat the food is to have the body move away from (3,5), so that (3,5) is free, then head can move to (3,6) from (3,5).\n\nOr from (2,6) or (4,5), but (4,5) is occupied.\n\n(4,5) is also occupied.\n\nSo we need to free up (3,5) or find a path.\n\nSince the snake is long, we need to move in a way that the body moves, and (3,5) becomes free at some point.\n\nCurrently, (3,5) is occupied by segment 8, which is not near tail, so it will take many moves for it to move away.\n\nThe tail is at (5,1), so the segment at (3,5) is index 8, so it will move only after the tail moves several times.\n\nTo estimate how many turns for (3,5) to be free: the snake has 19 segments, index from 0 to 18. Segment at index 8, so there are 10 segments after it (index 9 to 18), so when the snake moves, the position (3,5) will be occupied until that segment moves, which requires the head to move 8 times, I think, because each move, the body shifts, so after k moves, the segment that was at index i will be at position of index i-k or something.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nAfter one move, the segment that was at index i moves to the position of index i-1 if i>0, but for a fixed position, it changes.\n\nThe cell (3,5) is occupied by the snake body. It will be vacated when the segment that is there moves away and no other segment moves in, but since the snake is contiguous, when the tail passes, it will be free.\n\nSpecifically, the segment at (3,5) is part of the body. When the snake moves, this segment will move to a new position, and after it moves, the cell is free, unless the head or another segment moves there, but in general, for a body segment, when it moves, the cell it was in is vacated.\n\nIn the movement, when a body segment moves to a new cell, the old cell is vacated.\n\nFor example, from current state, after one move, say to (3,4), then as earlier, the segment that was at (3,5) is now at (4,5) or something.\n\nIn the first move up to (3,4), the segment that was at (3,5) (index 8) moves to where index 7 was, which is (4,5)? Old index 7 is (4,5), so new index 8 is old index 7 position (4,5).\n\nSo the cell (3,5) is now occupied by new index 9, which is old index 8 position (3,5), so (3,5) is still occupied by a different segment.\n\nAfter move, new index 9 is at (3,5), which was old index 8 position.\n\nSo (3,5) is still occupied.\n\nSimilarly, after another move, it might still be occupied.\n\nThe cell (3,5) will be occupied until the segment that is currently at index 8 moves away, but since segments shift, it takes time for the tail to reach that position.\n\nThe distance from the segment to the tail: the segment at (3,5) is index 8, tail is index 18, so there are 10 segments after it. Each move, the tail moves closer, but the position (3,5) will be occupied for about 10 moves, because after 10 moves, the segment that was at index 8 will be at the tail position and will move away.\n\nLet's calculate: after k moves, the segment that was at index i will be at index i - k if i-k >=0, or gone if i-k <0.\n\nFor example, after k moves, the segment that was at index i will be at position of old index i-k, but only if i-k >=0.\n\nThe cell (3,5) is currently occupied by the segment at index 8.\n\nAfter one move, the segment that was at index 8 is now at new index 8, which is at the position of old index 7.\n\nAfter two moves, it will be at the position of old index 6, and so on, until after 8 moves, it will be at the position of old index 0, which is the head position at that time, and then after another move, it becomes the tail and is removed.\n\nSpecifically, after m moves, the segment that was at index i will be at index i - m.\n\nWhen i - m < 0, it is no longer part of the snake.\n\nFor the cell to be vacated, the segment that is there moves, and no other segment moves in immediately, but since the snake is moving, the cell is vacated when the tail leaves it.\n\nFor position (3,5), it is occupied by index 8. After 8 moves, this segment will be at index 0, i.e., the head, and on the next move, it moves to a new position, and the cell is vacated.\n\nAfter 8 moves, the segment that was at index 8 will be at index 0 (head), so at that point, (3,5) is occupied by the head, but after the head moves, (3,5) is vacated.\n\nLet's clarify:\n\n- At turn 72, position (3,5) occupied by index 8.\n\n- After 8 moves (turn 80), the segment that was index 8 is now at index 0, head position, so (3,5) is head.\n\n- On turn 81, when head moves to a new cell, (3,5) is vacated.\n\nBut the food at (3,6) has life span 8, from turn 72 to 79, so by turn 80 it might be gone, depending on when it disappears.\n\nLife span: at turn 72, life span 8, so after turn 72, if not eaten, life span 7, ..., after turn 79, life span 0, disappears. So on turn 79, it can be eaten, but on turn 80, it is gone.\n\nTo eat on turn 79, head must be at (3,6) on turn 79.\n\nBut (3,5) will be free only after turn 81 or so, which is too late.\n\nFrom above, (3,5) is occupied until the head moves from there on turn 81, but food is gone by turn 80.\n\nSo directly, we cannot reach (3,6) from below because (3,5) is blocked.\n\nOther paths: from left, (2,6), or from right, but (4,6) is wall, so only from (2,6) or (3,5), but (3,5) blocked.\n\nSo we need to go to (2,6) or (4,5), but (4,5) is occupied.\n\n(4,5) is occupied by segment 7.\n\nSimilarly, (2,6) is free.\n\nSo we can approach from (2,6) to (3,6).\n\n(2,6) is free, (3,6) is food.\n\nTo move from head position to (2,6), we need a path.\n\nHead at (3,3), we can go to (3,4) or (2,3).\n\nIf we go to (2,3), then to (2,4), then to (2,5) but (2,5) is occupied, or to (2,6).\n\n(2,5) is occupied by segment 9.\n\nSimilarly, we need to free (2,5) or go around.\n\nSince the grid is small, we need to move the snake to create space.\n\nMoreover, there is a risk of getting trapped because the snake is long and space is tight.\n\nAlso, the tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut currently, tail is at (5,1), far from head.\n\nSo not immediate issue.\n\nNow, for long-term survival, we need to avoid dead ends and have space to move.\n\nLet's think about the available moves.\n\nAt turn 72, choices: U to (3,4) or L to (2,3).\n\nIf we go U to (3,4), then as before, only L to (2,4) is possible.\n\nFrom (2,4), we can go U to (2,5), but (2,5) is occupied by segment 9, body, collision.\n\nD to (2,3): (2,3) is now seg1 if we came from left, but in this case, from (3,4) to (2,4), let's simulate.\n\nSuppose turn 72: move U to (3,4)\n\nNew positions: as earlier, head (3,4), seg1 (3,3), seg2 (3,2), etc., seg9 (3,5), seg10 (2,5), etc.\n\nFrom (3,4), only possible move is L to (2,4), because U to (3,5) occupied, D to (3,3) occupied, R to (4,4) occupied.\n\nSo move L to (2,4).\n\nNew head: (2,4)\n\nNew positions:\n\n- Head: (2,4)\n\n- Seg1: old head (3,4)\n\n- Seg2: old seg1 (3,3)\n\n- Seg3: old seg2 (3,2)\n\n- Seg4: old seg3 (4,2)\n\n- Seg5: old seg4 (5,2)\n\n- Seg6: old seg5 (5,3)\n\n- Seg7: old seg6 (4,3)\n\n- Seg8: old seg7 (4,4)\n\n- Seg9: old seg8 (4,5)\n\n- Seg10: old seg9 (3,5)\n\n- Seg11: old seg10 (2,5)\n\n- Seg12: old seg11 (1,5)\n\n- Seg13: old seg12 (1,4)\n\n- Seg14: old seg13 (1,3)\n\n- Seg15: old seg14 (1,2)\n\n- Seg16: old seg15 (1,1)\n\n- Seg17: old seg16 (2,1)\n\n- Seg18: old seg17 (3,1)  // tail, old seg18 (4,1) vacated?

Let's use previous.\n\nAfter first move to (3,4), positions were:\n\nHead (3,4), seg1 (3,3), seg2 (3,2), seg3 (4,2), seg4 (5,2), seg5 (5,3), seg6 (4,3), seg7 (4,4), seg8 (4,5), seg9 (3,5), seg10 (2,5), seg11 (1,5), seg12 (1,4), seg13 (1,3), seg14 (1,2), seg15 (1,1), seg16 (2,1), seg17 (3,1), seg18 (4,1)\n\nThen move L to (2,4):\n\nNew head: (2,4)\n\nNew seg1: old head (3,4)\n\nNew seg2: old seg1 (3,3)\n\nNew seg3: old seg2 (3,2)\n\nNew seg4: old seg3 (4,2)\n\nNew seg5: old seg4 (5,2)\n\nNew seg6: old seg5 (5,3)\n\nNew seg7: old seg6 (4,3)\n\nNew seg8: old seg7 (4,4)\n\nNew seg9: old seg8 (4,5)\n\nNew seg10: old seg9 (3,5)\n\nNew seg11: old seg10 (2,5)\n\nNew seg12: old seg11 (1,5)\n\nNew seg13: old seg12 (1,4)\n\nNew seg14: old seg13 (1,3)\n\nNew seg15: old seg14 (1,2)\n\nNew seg16: old seg15 (1,1)\n\nNew seg17: old seg16 (2,1)\n\nNew seg18: old seg17 (3,1)  // tail, old seg18 (4,1) vacated\n\nFrom (2,4), possible moves:\n\n- U to (2,5): (2,5) is new seg11, which is old seg10 position (2,5), occupied by body, not tail, collision.\n\n- D to (2,3): (2,3) not occupied? New positions: (2,3) not listed, so free. But is it free? In new positions, we have seg2 at (3,3), seg3 at (3,2), etc., no (2,3), so yes free.\n\n- L to (1,4): (1,4) is new seg13, old seg12 position (1,4), occupied.\n\n- R to (3,4): (3,4) is new seg1, body, collision.\n\nSo only possible move is D to (2,3).\n\nThen from (2,3), we can go D to (2,2) or U to (2,4) but (2,4) is now body, or L to (1,3) occupied, R to (3,3) occupied.\n\nFrom (2,3): after moving to (2,3), new head (2,3), then moves:\n\n- U to (2,4): but (2,4) is now seg1, body, collision\n\n- D to (2,2): free, as not occupied\n\n- L to (1,3): (1,3) is occupied, seg14 or something\n\n- R to (3,3): occupied, seg2\n\nSo only D to (2,2).\n\nThen from (2,2), and so on.\n\nThis path is leading down to (2,2), which might be a dead end if not careful.\n\nIf at turn 72 we move L to (2,3) first.\n\nTurn 72: move L to (2,3)\n\nNew positions: head (2,3), seg1 (3,3), seg2 (3,2), seg3 (4,2), seg4 (5,2), seg5 (5,3), seg6 (4,3), seg7 (4,4), seg8 (4,5), seg9 (3,5), seg10 (2,5), seg11 (1,5), seg12 (1,4), seg13 (1,3), seg14 (1,2), seg15 (1,1), seg16 (2,1), seg17 (3,1), seg18 (4,1)  // tail at (4,1)\n\nFrom (2,3), possible moves: U to (2,4) free, D to (2,2) free, L to (1,3) occupied, R to (3,3) occupied.\n\nSo U or D.\n\nIf we go U to (2,4), then from (2,4), we can go U to (2,5) but occupied, or L to (1,4) occupied, R to (3,4) free?

That can't be.\n\nIn this state, at (3,4), after coming from (2,4), the positions are: head (3,4), seg1 (2,4), seg2 (2,3), etc., so (3,5) occupied, (3,3) occupied, (2,4) occupied, (4,4) occupied, so indeed, no possible move, death.\n\nThat's a problem.\n\nIf we go to (2,3) then U to (2,4), then R to (3,4), then from (3,4), all adjacent cells are occupied: (3,5) occupied, (3,3) occupied, (2,4) occupied, (4,4) occupied, so no move, collision or stuck, death.\n\nSimilarly, if from (2,3) we go D to (2,2), then we might have more space below.\n\nBut let's think about the food.\n\nPerhaps we should not go up immediately.\n\nSince the food has 8 turns, we can take a longer path to approach (3,6) from the right or left.\n\nFor example, go down to free space, then right, then up to (5,6) or (6,6), then left to (3,6).\n\nBut (3,6) is at top, so we need to go up.\n\nAlso, there is the internal obstacle at (4,6), so from right, we can go to (5,6) or (6,6), then to (5,6), then to (5,5), but (5,5) is free, then to (5,4), free, etc.\n\nBut the snake body is blocking the left side.\n\nPerhaps move towards the free area on the right.\n\nFor example, at turn 72, move L to (2,3), then D to (2,2), then R to (3,2) but occupied, or to (2,1) occupied, so from (2,2), we can go to (3,2) occupied or (2,1) occupied or (1,2) occupied, or (2,3) occupied.\n\nLet's see.\n\nFirst, turn 72: move L to (2,3)\n\nNew positions: head (2,3), seg1 (3,3), seg2 (3,2), seg3 (4,2), seg4 (5,2), seg5 (5,3), seg6 (4,3), seg7 (4,4), seg8 (4,5), seg9 (3,5), seg10 (2,5), seg11 (1,5), seg12 (1,4), seg13 (1,3), seg14 (1,2), seg15 (1,1), seg16 (2,1), seg17 (3,1), seg18 (4,1)\n\nFrom (2,3), we can go D to (2,2)\n\n(2,2) is free.\n\nMove D to (2,2)\n\nNew head: (2,2)\n\nNew seg1: old head (2,3)\n\nNew seg2: old seg1 (3,3)\n\nNew seg3: old seg2 (3,2)\n\nNew seg4: old seg3 (4,2)\n\nNew seg5: old seg4 (5,2)\n\nNew seg6: old seg5 (5,3)\n\nNew seg7: old seg6 (4,3)\n\nNew seg8: old seg7 (4,4)\n\nNew seg9: old seg8 (4,5)\n\nNew seg10: old seg9 (3,5)\n\nNew seg11: old seg10 (2,5)\n\nNew seg12: old seg11 (1,5)\n\nNew seg13: old seg12 (1,4)\n\nNew seg14: old seg13 (1,3)\n\nNew seg15: old seg14 (1,2)\n\nNew seg16: old seg15 (1,1)\n\nNew seg17: old seg16 (2,1)\n\nNew seg18: old seg17 (3,1)  // tail at (3,1), old seg18 (4,1) vacated\n\nFrom (2,2), possible moves:\n\n- U to (2,3): (2,3) is new seg1, occupied, collision\n\n- D to (2,1): (2,1) is new seg17, occupied, body, not tail? Tail is at (3,1), so (2,1) is body, collision\n\n- L to (1,2): (1,2) is new seg15, occupied\n\n- R to (3,2): (3,2) is new seg3, occupied\n\nSo all moves are invalid, death! \n\nThis is bad.\n\nIf we go U from (2,3) to (2,4), then as before, to (3,4), then stuck.\n\nSo both paths from (3,3) seem to lead to dead ends quickly if we don't eat food or free space.\n\nWe need to eat the food to grow and have more space or something, but the food is blocked.\n\nPerhaps we can go to the right area.\n\nAnother option: at (3,3), only U or L, but if we go U to (3,4), then L to (2,4), then from (2,4), we can only go D to (2,3), then from (2,3), to (2,2), then stuck as above.\n\nFrom (2,4), after moving to (2,4) from (3,4), positions: head (2,4), seg1 (3,4), seg2 (3,3), etc.\n\nFrom (2,4), only D to (2,3) possible, as U, L, R occupied.\n\nMove D to (2,3)\n\nNew head: (2,3)\n\nNew seg1: old head (2,4)\n\nNew seg2: old seg1 (3,4)\n\nNew seg3: old seg2 (3,3)\n\nNew seg4: old seg3 (3,2)\n\nNew seg5: old seg4 (4,2)\n\nNew seg6: old seg5 (5,2)\n\nNew seg7: old seg6 (5,3)\n\nNew seg8: old seg7 (4,3)\n\nNew seg9: old seg8 (4,4)\n\nNew seg10: old seg9 (4,5)\n\nNew seg11: old seg10 (3,5)\n\nNew seg12: old seg11 (2,5)\n\nNew seg13: old seg12 (1,5)\n\nNew seg14: old seg13 (1,4)\n\nNew seg15: old seg14 (1,3)\n\nNew seg16: old seg15 (1,2)\n\nNew seg17: old seg16 (1,1)\n\nNew seg18: old seg17 (2,1)  // tail at (2,1), old seg18 (3,1) vacated or something.\n\nFrom (2,3), possible moves:\n\n- U to (2,4): (2,4) is new seg1, occupied\n\n- D to (2,2): free?

death.\n\nSo in all cases, within 3 moves, we get stuck if we don't eat food.\n\nBut the food is not accessible directly.\n\nPerhaps we can eat the food by moving the body.\n\nBut (3,6) is not under body, it's free, but we can't reach it because (3,5) is occupied.\n\nThe only way is to have the head at (2,6) or (4,5) but (4,5) is occupied, or (3,6) directly from below, not possible.\n\n(4,5) is occupied, but we can move to free it.\n\nFor example, if we move the snake such that the body at (3,5) moves away.\n\nBut as calculated, it takes many turns.\n\nLife span is 8, so we have time, but in the short term, we are getting stuck.\n\nPerhaps there is a move I missed.\n\nAt turn 72, from (3,3), only U or L.\n\nBut if we go U to (3,4), then from (3,4), only L to (2,4), then from (2,4), only D to (2,3), then from (2,3), only D to (2,2), then stuck.\n\nIf from (2,3) we could go to other places, but not.\n\nAnother idea: when we move, the tail moves, so some cells become free.\n\nFor example, when we move from (3,3) to (3,4), the tail at (5,1) is removed, so (5,1) is free, but it's far.\n\nSimilarly, when we move to (2,3), tail removed, (5,1) free.\n\nBut near the head, cells are still occupied.\n\nPerhaps we can go down to the area where the tail is.\n\nFor example, at turn 72, move L to (2,3), then from (2,3), instead of U or D, but D is to (2,2), which might lead to free cells below.\n\nFrom (2,2), as before, all adjacent are occupied: U (2,3) body, D (2,1) body, L (1,2) body, R (3,2) body, so no move.\n\nUnless we can go to (3,2), but it's occupied.\n\nSo it seems the snake is in a position where it will die in a few turns if we don't do something.\n\nBut there must be a way.\n\nPerhaps we can go to (3,4) and then not to (2,4), but from (3,4) only (2,4) is free, so no choice.\n\nSimilarly for other.\n\nUnless we eat the food soon, but we can't.\n\nAnother thought: the food at (3,6) can be eaten if we go to (3,6) from (2,6) or (4,6), but (4,6) wall, so only from (2,6).\n\n(2,6) is free, so if we can reach (2,6), we can eat the food.\n\nFrom head at (3,3), how to reach (2,6)?\n\nPath: for example, (3,3) to (2,3) to (2,4) to (2,5) but (2,5) occupied, or to (1,6) then to (2,6).\n\n(1,6) is free, (2,6) free.\n\nBut to go to (2,4), from (2,3) we can go U to (2,4), but from (2,4) we can go U to (2,5) occupied, so not directly.\n\nFrom (2,4), we can go to (1,4) but occupied, or R to (3,4) free, as in earlier path.\n\nBut then from (3,4) we get stuck.\n\nPerhaps we can go to (1,6) first.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (2,3), then to (2,4), then to (1,4) but occupied, not possible.\n\nFrom (2,3) to (2,4), then to (3,4), then to (3,5) occupied, not possible.\n\nSo it seems difficult to reach (2,6) directly.\n\nMaybe go down and right to free area.\n\nFor example, at turn 72, move L to (2,3), then D to (2,2), but from (2,2) no move, as before.\n\nUnless at (2,2) we can move, but all adjacent occupied.\n\nPerhaps when we move, the occupation changes.\n\nFor example, after moving to (2,3), the cell (2,2) is free, but when we move to (2,2), then the cells around are occupied.\n\nBut (2,2) has neighbors: (2,3) which is now body, (2,1) body, (1,2) body, (3,2) body, all occupied after the move.\n\nSo no escape.\n\nSimilarly for other paths.\n\nPerhaps the only way is to have the head move in a way that the body moves and creates a path.\n\nBut in this case, with the current position, moving U or L both lead to dead end in few turns.\n\nLet's count the turns to death.\n\nTurn 72: move U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 73: from (3,4) move L to (2,4)\n\nTurn 74: from (2,4) move D to (2,3)\n\nTurn 75: from (2,3) move D to (2,2)\n\nTurn 76: from (2,2), no move, death.\n\nSimilarly, if move L first:\n\nTurn 72: move L to (2,3)\n\nTurn 73: from (2,3) move U to (2,4)\n\nTurn 74: from (2,4) move R to (3,4)\n\nTurn 75: from (3,4), no move, death.\n\nOr if from (2,3) move D to (2,2) on turn 73, then turn 74 at (2,2) no move, death.\n\nSo in all cases, by turn 75 or 76, we die if we don't eat food.\n\nBut we can eat the food if we reach it.\n\nThe food is at (3,6), and we can reach it if we go to (2,6) and then to (3,6), but we can't reach (2,6) in time.\n\nFor example, from (3,3) to (2,3) to (2,4) to (2,5) but (2,5) occupied, not possible.\n\nTo (3,4) to (3,5) occupied, not possible.\n\nSo perhaps we need to move in a way that (2,5) or (3,5) becomes free, but it takes many turns.\n\nFor example, (2,5) is currently occupied by segment 9 or 10.\n\nIn initial, (2,5) is segment 9.\n\nIndex 9, tail index 18, so after 9 moves, it might be free.\n\nAfter 9 moves, the segment at index 9 will be at head position, then on 10th move, it vacates.\n\nBut life span only 8 turns, so not in time.\n\nSimilarly for (3,5), index 8, after 8 moves at head, 9th move vacates, but life span 8, so on turn 79, if we can be at (3,6), but (3,5) is still occupied until turn 80 or so.\n\nNot possible.\n\nTherefore, it seems impossible to eat this food within the life span with the current snake position.\n\nBut that can't be, or perhaps the game is designed that way.\n\nMaybe there is another way.\n\nPerhaps the food can be eaten if the head moves to it when the body moves away, but in this case, the body is not on the food, so we just need to move the head to (3,6).\n\nBut to do that, we need an adjacent cell free to approach from.\n\nAdjacent cells to (3,6): (3,5), (3,7) but y=7 wall, (2,6), (4,6) wall.\n\nSo only (3,5) and (2,6).\n\n(3,5) occupied, (2,6) free.\n\nSo only from (2,6).\n\nTo reach (2,6), we need a path.\n\nAvailable free cells near: (2,4), (3,4), (1,6), etc.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (2,3) to (2,4) to (2,5) occupied, not possible.\n\nFrom (3,3) to (3,4) to (2,4) to (1,4) occupied, not possible.\n\nTo (2,4) to (1,4) occupied.\n\nOr to (2,4) to (2,3) to (2,2) etc, not towards (2,6).\n\nSo it seems we cannot reach (2,6) in few turns because (2,5) is blocked.\n\nTherefore, for survival, we might need to avoid the area and move to where there is more space, but in this case, moving U or L both lead to death quickly.\n\nPerhaps we can move to the right side.\n\nFor example, from (3,3), if we could go right, but (4,3) occupied, not possible.\n\nOr down, occupied.\n\nSo only U or L, both bad.\n\nUnless at some point a cell becomes free.\n\nFor example, when we move, the tail moves, so cells like (5,1) is freed, but it's far, not helpful for head movement in short term.\n\nSo perhaps the snake is doomed to die soon, and we should maximize turns or something.\n\nBut the instruction is to maximize score, so eating food is good, but if we can't, survive as long as possible.\n\nBut in this case, we die in 4 turns.\n\nLet's confirm with the first path.\n\nTurn 72: move U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 73: move L to (2,4)\n\nTurn 74: move D to (2,3)\n\nTurn 75: move D to (2,2)\n\nTurn 76: at (2,2), no valid move, so if no move, death.\n\nSimilarly, other paths same.\n\nSo maximum we can live 4 more turns.\n\nBut perhaps we can live longer if we choose differently, but no choice.\n\nAnother idea: when we are at (2,4), instead of D to (2,3), but only D is possible, no other.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo for turn 72, we have to choose U or L, but both lead to death in 4 turns.\n\nPerhaps we can eat the food by some miracle.\n\nOr maybe I missed a move.\n\nHead at (3,3), direction U, so we can move U or L, as R and D occupied.\n\nNo other.\n\nSo for the answer, since we need to output actions for multiple turns, but we can only do up to turn 75 or 76.\n\nThe state is turn 72, so we need to output actions for turn 72, 73, etc., as many as we can.\n\nBut the format is to think 5+ turns ahead, but we can't.\n\nPerhaps in this position, moving U or L doesn't matter, we die soon.\n\nBut let's choose one.\n\nSince food is at (3,6), and we are at (3,3), going up might be closer, but not really.\n\nOr going left might have more space, but from above, both similar.\n\nPerhaps at turn 72, move U to (3,4), then turn 73 L to (2,4), then turn 74 D to (2,3), then turn 75 D to (2,2), then on turn 76, at (2,2), no move, so we don't output turn 76 action.\n\nBut for the answer, we output until we can.\n\nBut the food has life span 8, so if we survive, we might eat it, but we can't survive.\n\nUnless new food spawns, but no, only this food given.\n\nSo I think we have to accept that we die soon.\n\nBut for the sake of the answer, let's output the actions until death.\n\nBut the AI should try to survive as long as possible.\n\nPerhaps there is a way to go to (3,4) and then to (3,5) if it becomes free, but it won't soon.\n\nAnother thought: the rule about food under body, but here food is not under body.\n\nOr tail reward danger, not applicable.\n\nSo I think we are stuck.\n\nPerhaps the internal obstacle or walls can be used, but not.\n\nSo for turn 72, I'll choose to move U, as it's towards the food.\n\nThen actions:\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nTurn 73: L (from (3,4) to (2,4))\n\nTurn 74: D (from (2,4) to (2,3))\n\nTurn 75: D (from (2,3) to (2,2))\n\nThen at (2,2), no move, so stop.\n\nBut in the answer format, we output actions for turns where we can move.\n\nSince the snake dies on turn 76 when no move, we output up to turn 75.\n\nBut turn 75 action is D.\n\nNow, for the boxed answer.\n\nBut the instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead, but here we can only think 4 turns ahead to death.\n\nPerhaps for long-term, but no long-term here.\n\nMaybe we can have a different first move.\n\nOr perhaps when at (3,4), after moving, if we could go to (3,5), but occupied, not possible.\n\nI think we have to proceed.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nTurn 73: L\n\nTurn 74: D\n\nTurn 75: D\n\nBut turn 75 is from (2,3) to (2,2), and on turn 76, no move.\n\nBut the food is not eaten.\n\nPerhaps on turn 75, at (2,2), if we could move, but no.\n\nSo I think that's it.\n</think>\nThe current state presents significant challenges due to the snake's position and the surrounding obstacles. The snake is trapped in a confined area with limited free cells, and the only available food at (3,6) is inaccessible within its remaining lifespan of 8 turns (until turn 79) because the critical adjacent cells ((3,5) and (2,5)) are occupied by the snake's body and cannot be freed in time. Moving towards the food directly is impossible, and both initial move choices (Up or Left) lead to a dead end within 4 turns.\n\nAfter evaluating all possible paths 5+ turns ahead:\n- Moving Up or Left from (3,3) results in death by turn 76 due to no valid moves, as the snake becomes surrounded by its own body.\n- The food at (3,6) cannot be reached safely within its lifespan because the body segments blocking access (e.g., (3,5) and (2,5)) require more than 8 turns to vacate, and the available free space is insufficient for maneuvering.\n- Survival beyond turn 76 is impossible regardless of the chosen path, as the snake will be trapped with no escape routes.\n\nTo maximize the number of turns survived (as eating the food is infeasible), the chosen path moves Up on turn 72 to stay closer to the food in case of an unlikely opportunity, though it does not materialize. The actions until the inevitable death are as follows:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 72: U\nTurn 73: L\nTurn 74: D\nTurn 75: D\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 73, and I'm the AI controlling the snake. The goal is to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks, thinking at least 5 turns ahead.\n\n**Grid Setup:**\n- Walls: Border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Also, there's an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n- Snake Positions: The snake has 19 segments. Head is at (3,4), and it's moving Up (U). The tail is at (4,1).\n- Food:\n  - (3,6) with value 1 and life span 7. This is positive food since value is +1.\n  - (5,5) with value 1 and life span 10. Also positive.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including the current one. So for (3,6), life span 7 means it will disappear after 7 turns from now, including turn 73. Similarly for (5,5), life span 10.\n\n**Snake Movement:**\n- Current head direction is U (up), so moving in the positive y-direction.\n- I can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse. Since current direction is U, I cannot move D on the next turn. So possible moves from (3,4) are U, L, R (not D).\n\n**Collision Risks:**\n- Body collision: Head touches any body segment except the tail, but I can move into the tail cell if the tail moves away.\n- Wall collision: Cannot move to walls. Walls are at borders and (4,6).\n\n**Special Food Rule:**\n- Food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it. Also, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. So cells like (0,y) for all y, (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) are walls. Also internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: List of coordinates from head to tail:\n\n1. Head: (3,4) - moving U\n\n2. (3,3)\n\n3. (3,2)\n\n4. (4,2)\n\n5. (5,2)\n\n6. (5,3)\n\n7. (4,3)\n\n8. (4,4)\n\n9. (4,5)\n\n10. (3,5)\n\n11. (2,5)\n\n12. (1,5)\n\n13. (1,4)\n\n14. (1,3)\n\n15. (1,2)\n\n16. (1,1)\n\n17. (2,1)\n\n18. (3,1)\n\n19. Tail: (4,1)\n\nThe snake is quite long, 19 segments.\n\nFood: (3,6) and (5,5), both positive with value +1.\n\nCurrent head position: (3,4), direction U.\n\nPossible moves from (3,4):\n\n- U: to (3,5)\n\n- D: to (3,3) but D is opposite to current U, so not allowed? No instant reverse means I cannot move directly opposite on the next turn. Since I'm moving U now, I cannot choose D for the next move. But from position, moving D to (3,3) is possible only if not wall or body, but let's check.\n\nFirst, check adjacent cells:\n\n- Up: (3,5) - what is here? From snake positions, (3,5) is the 10th segment. It's a body part.\n\n- Down: (3,3) - is (3,3), which is the 2nd segment, body.\n\n- Left: (2,4) - not in snake positions? Snake positions: (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), etc. (2,4) is not listed, so it should be empty.\n\n- Right: (4,4) - (4,4) is the 8th segment, body.\n\nAlso, walls: (3,4) is at x=3,y=4, not border.\n\nSo possible moves:\n\n- U: to (3,5) - but (3,5) is occupied by snake body (segment 10), so moving there would cause collision, death.\n\n- D: to (3,3) - occupied by segment 2, also collision.\n\n- L: to (2,4) - not occupied, and not wall? x=2,y=4, borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (2,4) is within bounds, no wall. Also no internal obstacle mentioned except (4,6), so (2,4) should be free.\n\n- R: to (4,4) - occupied by segment 8, collision.\n\nTherefore, from (3,4), the only safe move is L to (2,4).\n\nIs that right? Let's confirm.\n\nSnake positions: [(3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1)]\n\nSo (2,4) is not in this list, so it's empty.\n\n(4,4) is in the list, occupied.\n\n(3,5) occupied.\n\n(3,3) occupied.\n\nYes, so only left to (2,4) is safe.\n\nBut what about the direction? Current head direction is U, but I can change direction to L or R, just not D.\n\nMoving L is allowed since not opposite.\n\nSo for turn 73, I must move L to (2,4).\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's simulate what happens if I move L to (2,4).\n\nAfter move: head moves to (2,4), and since no food eaten, tail moves away from (4,1) to (3,1)? Let's see the snake movement.\n\nWhen snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the next position, so tail is removed unless food is eaten.\n\nHere, no food at (2,4), so snake grows only if it eats food.\n\nFood is at (3,6) and (5,5), not at (2,4), so no food eaten.\n\nSo after moving to (2,4), new snake positions:\n\nHead: (2,4)\n\nThen body: previous head (3,4) becomes second segment, then (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), and tail (4,1) is removed.\n\nTail was (4,1), and since no food, tail is removed, so the new tail is the second last segment, which was (3,1)? Positions after move:\n\n- New head: (2,4)\n\n- Then: (3,4)  // previous head\n\n- (3,3)  // was second\n\n- (3,2)  // third\n\n- (4,2)  // fourth\n\n- (5,2)  // fifth\n\n- (5,3)  // sixth\n\n- (4,3)  // seventh\n\n- (4,4)  // eighth\n\n- (4,5)  // ninth\n\n- (3,5)  // tenth\n\n- (2,5)  // eleventh\n\n- (1,5)  // twelfth\n\n- (1,4)  // thirteenth\n\n- (1,3)  // fourteenth\n\n- (1,2)  // fifteenth\n\n- (1,1)  // sixteenth\n\n- (2,1)  // seventeenth\n\n- (3,1)  // eighteenth, now tail\n\n(4,1) was the last, removed, so tail is now at (3,1).\n\nSnake length still 19? Original 19 segments, moved without eating, so new length 19, but positions shifted.\n\nNumber of segments: head + 18 body segments, total 19.\n\nAfter move: new head at (2,4), and the segments from index 1 to 18 of previous become index 2 to 19, but index 1 was (3,4), which is now the second segment, and the last segment (4,1) is removed, so new positions: [ (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1) ]\n\nYes, tail at (3,1).\n\nNow, head direction: I moved L, so new direction is L.\n\nNow, for turn 74, I need to choose next move from (2,4).\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut current direction is L (since I just moved left), so I cannot move R (opposite).\n\nNow, check adjacent cells:\n\n- U: (2,5) - is this occupied? From above, (2,5) is in positions, it's the twelfth segment in new list? New positions: index 0: (2,4) head, index 1: (3,4), index 2: (3,3), ..., index 11: (2,5)? Let's list with indices:\n\n0: (2,4) head\n\n1: (3,4)\n\n2: (3,3)\n\n3: (3,2)\n\n4: (4,2)\n\n5: (5,2)\n\n6: (5,3)\n\n7: (4,3)\n\n8: (4,4)\n\n9: (4,5)\n\n10: (3,5)\n\n11: (2,5)\n\n12: (1,5)\n\n13: (1,4)\n\n14: (1,3)\n\n15: (1,2)\n\n16: (1,1)\n\n17: (2,1)\n\n18: (3,1) tail\n\nSo (2,5) is position 11, which is a body segment, not head. Moving to (2,5) would cause collision with body.\n\n- D: (2,3) - is this occupied? (2,3) not in the list. Snake has (1,3), (1,4), but (2,3) not mentioned, so probably empty.\n\n- L: (1,4) - (1,4) is position 13, body segment.\n\n- R: (3,4) - but (3,4) is position 1, body segment. Also, R is opposite to current L? Current direction is L, so moving R would be opposite, not allowed.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (2,5) - occupied, collision\n\n- D: (2,3) - not occupied, and not wall? x=2,y=3, within bounds, no obstacle, so free.\n\n- L: (1,4) - occupied, collision\n\n- R: (3,4) - occupied, and also opposite direction, so invalid.\n\nTherefore, only possible move is D to (2,3).\n\nSo for turn 74, move D to (2,3).\n\nNow, continue.\n\nAfter move to (2,3): no food there, so tail moves, new head (2,3), new positions:\n\n[ (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1) ] and tail removed from (3,1), so tail is now (2,1)? Last is (2,1), but (3,1) was removed.\n\nPrevious positions: after turn 73, positions were [ (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), ..., (3,1) ]\n\nAfter moving head to (2,3), new head (2,3), then (2,4), then (3,4), (3,3), and so on up to (2,1), and (3,1) removed.\n\nSo positions: [ (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1) ]\n\nTail at (2,1).\n\nHead direction: moved D, so down.\n\nTurn 75: from (2,3), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R. But cannot move U (opposite to D).\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n- U: (2,4) - position 1, body, collision\n\n- D: (2,2) - not in positions, should be free? (2,2) not listed, and not wall.\n\n- L: (1,3) - position 15? Positions: index 0: (2,3) head, 1: (2,4), 2: (3,4), 3: (3,3), 4: (3,2), 5: (4,2), 6: (5,2), 7: (5,3), 8: (4,3), 9: (4,4), 10: (4,5), 11: (3,5), 12: (2,5), 13: (1,5), 14: (1,4), 15: (1,3), 16: (1,2), 17: (1,1), 18: (2,1) tail\n\nSo (1,3) is index 15, body.\n\n- R: (3,3) - index 3, body.\n\nTherefore, only possible move is D to (2,2).\n\nSo move D to (2,2).\n\nThis is getting constrained. I need to think about food and long-term.\n\nBut let's see where this is going.\n\nAfter move to (2,2): no food, so tail moves.\n\nNew positions: [ (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) ] tail at (1,1), since (2,1) removed.\n\n(2,1) was tail, removed.\n\nHead direction D.\n\nTurn 76: from (2,2), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: cannot U (opposite).\n\n- U: (2,3) - position 1, body\n\n- D: (2,1) - but (2,1) was just removed, not in positions now? Positions: (2,2) head, (2,3), (2,4), ..., (1,1) tail.\n\n(2,1) is not in positions, so (2,1) should be free? But (2,1) is at x=2,y=1, which is not wall, y=0 is wall, but y=1 is not border? Walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is fine.\n\n(2,1) is not occupied now, since it was tail and removed.\n\nIn positions, we have (1,1) at tail, but (2,1) is empty.\n\n- L: (1,2) - position 17? Index: 0:(2,2), 1:(2,3), 2:(2,4), 3:(3,4), 4:(3,3), 5:(3,2), 6:(4,2), 7:(5,2), 8:(5,3), 9:(4,3), 10:(4,4), 11:(4,5), 12:(3,5), 13:(2,5), 14:(1,5), 15:(1,4), 16:(1,3), 17:(1,2), 18:(1,1) tail\n\n(1,2) is index 17, body.\n\n- R: (3,2) - index 5, body.\n\nSo D to (2,1) is possible and free.\n\nMove D to (2,1).\n\nThen turn 77: from (2,1), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: cannot U (opposite).\n\n- U: (2,2) - position 1, body\n\n- D: (2,0) - but y=0 is wall, so collision, death.\n\n- L: (1,1) - position 18, tail. Moving to tail is allowed if tail moves away.\n\n- R: (3,1) - not in positions? (3,1) not listed, so free.\n\n(3,1) is not in current positions, so empty.\n\nAlso, walls: (2,0) is wall, (1,1) is occupied by tail.\n\nBut moving to tail cell is possible if tail moves.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) is free.\n\nSo possible moves:\n\n- L to (1,1): since it's tail, and if I move there, and no food, tail moves away, so no collision. But let's see.\n\n- R to (3,1): free.\n\n- D to (2,0): wall, death.\n\n- U: opposite or body, not possible.\n\nU is to (2,2), body, collision.\n\nD to wall, death.\n\nL to (1,1): tail cell.\n\nR to (3,1): free.\n\nBoth L and R might be safe, but I need to check.\n\nFirst, if I move R to (3,1): no food, so new head (3,1), then body (2,1), (2,2), etc., tail removed from (1,1).\n\nNew positions: [ (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) ] and (1,2) removed? Previous positions had (1,2) and (1,1), but (1,1) was tail, removed, so new tail is (1,3) or something.\n\nPrevious before move: positions [ (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) ] tail at (1,2)? Index 18: (1,2)\n\nAfter moving head to (3,1), new head (3,1), then (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) and (1,2) removed, so tail at (1,3).\n\n(1,2) was removed.\n\nIf I move L to (1,1): (1,1) is the current tail position.\n\nMoving to tail: head moves to (1,1), and since no food (assuming), tail moves away to the previous position, so no collision.\n\nNew positions: head to (1,1), then (2,1), (2,2), etc., and tail removed from the end.\n\nCurrent positions before move: [ (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) ]\n\nMove head to (1,1), which is not occupied except by tail, but tail will move.\n\nNew positions: [ (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) ] and (1,2) removed, tail at (1,3).\n\nSo both moves are possible, but moving L to (1,1) might be closer to the left wall, but no immediate danger.\n\nBut I have food to consider.\n\nI need to go back to the beginning.\n\nAt turn 73, from (3,4), I only have one choice: move L to (2,4), as I thought earlier.\n\nBut is that true?\n\nLet me double-check the grid.\n\nCurrent head (3,4), direction U.\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n- Up: (3,5) - occupied by snake, segment 10 in initial list, which is (3,5)\n\n- Down: (3,3) - occupied by segment 2, (3,3)\n\n- Left: (2,4) - not occupied, free\n\n- Right: (4,4) - occupied by segment 8, (4,4)\n\nAnd walls: (3,4) is not wall, (2,4) not wall.\n\nSo yes, only left is safe.\n\nBut what about the food? (3,6) is above, but I can't go up because it's occupied.\n\n(3,6) is at y=6, x=3.\n\nFrom (3,4), (3,5) is occupied, so I can't go up directly.\n\nPerhaps later I can go there.\n\nAlso, (5,5) is another food.\n\nBut for now, at turn 73, I must move left to (2,4).\n\nThen at turn 74, from (2,4), I must move down to (2,3), as only choice.\n\nThen at turn 75, from (2,3), move down to (2,2).\n\nThen at turn 76, from (2,2), move down to (2,1).\n\nThen at turn 77, from (2,1), I can move left to (1,1) or right to (3,1).\n\n(1,1) is the bottom-left corner almost, and (3,1) is to the right.\n\nNow, food at (3,6) and (5,5).\n\n(3,6) has life span 7, so from turn 73, it will disappear after 7 turns, including 73, so it will be available until turn 79? Let's calculate life span.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current.\n\nAt turn 73, life span 7, so on turn 73, it is present, life span decreases to 6 after turn 73.\n\nAfter turn 73, life span becomes 6.\n\nAfter turn 74, 5, and so on, until life span 0, it disappears.\n\nSo for food at (3,6) with life span 7 at turn 73:\n\n- Turn 73: present, life span 7\n\n- After turn 73, before turn 74: life span 6\n\n- After turn 74: 5\n\n- After turn 75: 4\n\n- After turn 76: 3\n\n- After turn 77: 2\n\n- After turn 78: 1\n\n- After turn 79: 0, disappears, so not available on turn 80.\n\nSimilarly, for (5,5) life span 10 at turn 73:\n\n- Turn 73: 10\n\n- After 73: 9\n\n- ...\n\n- Disappears after turn 82 (since 10 - 10 =0 after turn 82, not available on turn 83).\n\nNow, at turn 77, I am at (2,1), and I need to decide where to go.\n\nBut I need to think about getting to the food.\n\nAlso, there is the internal obstacle at (4,6), but (3,6) is at x=3,y=6, not (4,6), so (3,6) is accessible, but (4,6) is wall.\n\n(4,6) is internal obstacle, so cannot go there.\n\nNow, to reach (3,6), I need to go to (3,5) or (3,7), but y=7 is wall, so only from (3,5) or (2,6) or (4,6), but (4,6) is wall, so from (3,5) or (2,6) or (4,5) etc.\n\nBut (3,5) is currently occupied by the snake.\n\nIn the initial state, (3,5) is segment 10.\n\nAfter moving, it might free up.\n\nLet's simulate the path I have.\n\nAt turn 73: move L to (2,4)\n\nSnake: head (2,4), positions as above.\n\nTurn 74: move D to (2,3)\n\nHead (2,3)\n\nTurn 75: move D to (2,2)\n\nHead (2,2)\n\nTurn 76: move D to (2,1)\n\nHead (2,1)\n\nNow turn 77: from (2,1), direction D.\n\nI can move L to (1,1) or R to (3,1).\n\nIf I move R to (3,1):\n\nNew head (3,1), direction R (since moved right).\n\nThen from (3,1), possible moves: cannot L (opposite).\n\n- U: (3,2) - occupied? Current positions after turn 76: before turn 77 move.\n\nAfter turn 76: head at (2,1), positions: [ (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) ] tail at (1,2)\n\nMove R to (3,1): (3,1) is free, so new positions: [ (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) ] and (1,2) removed, tail at (1,3)\n\nHead at (3,1), direction R.\n\nTurn 78: from (3,1), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R. Cannot L (opposite).\n\n- U: (3,2) - occupied by position 7? Index: 0:(3,1), 1:(2,1), 2:(2,2), 3:(2,3), 4:(2,4), 5:(3,4), 6:(3,3), 7:(3,2), 8:(4,2), 9:(5,2), 10:(5,3), 11:(4,3), 12:(4,4), 13:(4,5), 14:(3,5), 15:(2,5), 16:(1,5), 17:(1,4), 18:(1,3) tail\n\n(3,2) is index 7, body.\n\n- D: (3,0) - y=0 wall, death\n\n- L: (2,1) - position 1, body\n\n- R: (4,1) - not occupied, free? (4,1) not in positions, so free.\n\nMove R to (4,1).\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut I need to get to food.\n\nFood at (3,6) is only available until turn 79, so I need to reach it by turn 79.\n\nAt turn 77, I am at (2,1), which is far from (3,6).\n\nFrom (2,1) to (3,6), Manhattan distance |3-2| + |6-1| =1+5=6, so at least 6 moves away.\n\nTurn 77 to turn 79 is only 3 turns: turn 77, 78, 79.\n\nOn turn 77, I move from (2,1) to say (3,1) or (1,1), then turn 78 to somewhere, turn 79 to (3,6).\n\nBut from (2,1), to (3,6) in 3 moves: possible? From (2,1) to (3,1) to (3,2) to (3,3) etc, but (3,2) and (3,3) are occupied, so not possible directly.\n\nFor example, from (2,1) at turn 77, if I go to (3,1), then turn 78 from (3,1) to (4,1), then turn 79 from (4,1) to (4,2), but (4,2) is occupied, and (3,6) is far.\n\nFrom (3,1) to (3,6) in two moves? Impossible, min 5 moves.\n\n|3-3| + |6-1| =5, so at least 5 moves from (3,1) to (3,6).\n\nSimilarly from (2,1), it's farther.\n\nSo by turn 79, I cannot reach (3,6) because it's too far and the path is blocked by the snake body.\n\nTurn 77 is after turn 76, which is after turn 75, etc.\n\nCurrent turn 73: at (3,4)\n\nTurn 74: (2,4)\n\nTurn 75: (2,3)\n\nTurn 76: (2,2)\n\nTurn 77: (2,1) or (3,1)\n\nFrom (2,1) at turn 77, to (3,6) at turn 79: only 2 moves, but distance 5, impossible.\n\nSimilarly, even at turn 78, from say (3,1) or (2,1), still far.\n\nAt turn 76, I am at (2,2), turn 77 from (2,2) to (2,1) or other, but in my path I went to (2,1) at turn 76? Let's list my positions:\n\nTurn 73: move to (2,4)\n\nTurn 74: move to (2,3)\n\nTurn 75: move to (2,2)\n\nTurn 76: move to (2,1)\n\nSo at turn 76, head at (2,1)\n\nTurn 77: from (2,1), can move to (1,1) or (3,1)\n\nTurn 78: from there, say (3,1), then to (4,1) or (3,2) but (3,2) occupied, so to (4,1)\n\nTurn 79: from (4,1) to (5,1) or (4,2) but (4,2) occupied, so to (5,1) if possible, but (5,1) not wall, not occupied? In positions, at turn 78, if head at (4,1), positions would be [ (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4) ] etc, (5,1) free, so move to (5,1)\n\nThen turn 80, but food (3,6) disappears after turn 79, so on turn 80 not available.\n\nAnd (5,1) to (3,6) is far.\n\nSo I cannot reach (3,6) in time. It will disappear before I can eat it.\n\nSimilarly, the other food at (5,5) has longer life, until turn 82.\n\nSo perhaps I should aim for (5,5).\n\nAt turn 76, I am at (2,1), which is (2,1), (5,5) is at (5,5), distance |5-2| + |5-1| =3+4=7, so at least 7 moves.\n\nFrom turn 76 to turn 82, that's 6 turns: turn 76 to 77,78,79,80,81,82.\n\nTurn 76: at (2,1)\n\nTurn 77: to (3,1) or (1,1)\n\nSay to (3,1)\n\nTurn 78: to (4,1)\n\nTurn 79: to (5,1)\n\nTurn 80: to (5,2) but (5,2) is occupied?

In my earlier simulation, when I moved to (2,3), positions were [ (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1) ] so (3,5) is still occupied.\n\nSimilarly, later turns.\n\n(3,5) is only freed when the tail passes it, but the tail is at (4,1) initially, and moving slowly.\n\nIn the path I took, the tail is moving left and up, so (3,5) might not be freed soon.\n\nFor example, in turn 77, when I was at (2,1), the positions had (3,5) at index 14 or something, still occupied.\n\nIn fact, in the list at turn 76, (3,5) is position 14, not tail.\n\nThe tail is at (1,2), so (3,5) is far from tail, so it will take many turns to free up.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) is also occupied.\n\nTo reach (3,6), I need to go to (3,5) first, but (3,5) is occupied and not freeing soon.\n\nSo it's impossible to eat (3,6) because the path is blocked and time is short.\n\nFor (5,5), it's possible if I can get there.\n\nBut in my current path, I am going to the bottom, so I need to turn up.\n\nAt turn 77, from (2,1), if I move to (3,1), then to (4,1), (5,1), (5,2) but (5,2) is occupied, so I have to go to (6,1), then (6,2), etc.\n\nFrom (5,1) at turn 79, I can move to (5,2) but it's occupied, so I can't.\n\nUnless it frees up.\n\nLet's see when (5,2) is freed.\n\nInitial positions: (5,2) is segment 5.\n\nAfter moves, at turn 73: after moving to (2,4), (5,2) is still there.\n\nTurn 74: (5,2) still\n\nTurn 75: (5,2) still\n\nTurn 76: (5,2) still, as position 6 in my list.\n\nIn turn 76 positions: index 6: (5,2)\n\nThen when the tail moves, at turn 77, when I move to (3,1), tail moves to (1,3), so (5,2) still occupied.\n\nThe segment (5,2) will only be freed when it becomes the tail or is passed.\n\nIn the current snake configuration, the tail is moving towards the bottom-left, so (5,2) is in the middle, it will take time to become tail.\n\nFor example, from the list, the snake is from head at (2,1) to tail at (1,2), with (5,2) at index 6, so it will be freed after 12 moves or something, which is after turn 88, too late.\n\nSo (5,2) is occupied for many turns.\n\nSimilarly, to reach (5,5), I need to go to (5,4) or (4,5) or (5,6), but y=7 wall, so (5,6) not possible.\n\n(4,5) is occupied, (5,4) might be free or not.\n\n(5,4) not in initial positions, so free, but I need to access it.\n\nFrom current position, I am at (2,1), (5,5) is at (5,5), so I can go to (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2) but occupied, so I have to go to (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), then to (5,5), but (6,5) might be free, but it's long way.\n\nFrom (5,1) to (5,5) directly, but (5,2), (5,3), (5,4) may be occupied.\n\n(5,3) is occupied in initial, position 6.\n\nIn turn 76 positions, (5,3) is index 11.\n\nSo occupied.\n\nSo I can't go up from (5,1) because (5,2) occupied.\n\nI have to go right to (6,1), then up to (6,2), etc.\n\nThen from (6,5) to (5,5), if (5,5) is still there.\n\n(5,5) has life span 10, so until turn 82.\n\nTurn 76: at (2,1)\n\nTurn 77: to (3,1)\n\nTurn 78: to (4,1)\n\nTurn 79: to (5,1)\n\nTurn 80: to (6,1)\n\nTurn 81: from (6,1), can move U to (6,2) if free, which it should be.\n\nThen to (6,3), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nTurn 82: from (6,5) to (5,5) to eat.\n\nOn turn 82, (5,5) has life span: at turn 73, life span 10, after turn 73:9, ... after turn 81: 10-9=1, so on turn 82, before move, life span 1, after move it becomes 0 and disappears, but on turn 82, it is still present, so I can eat it on turn 82.\n\nIf I move to (5,5) on turn 82, I can eat it.\n\nIn this case, from (6,5) to (5,5) is one move.\n\nBut I need to reach (6,5) by turn 81.\n\nFrom turn 80 at (6,1), to (6,5) in 4 moves: turn 80 to (6,1), turn 81 to (6,2), turn 82 to (6,3), then turn 83 to (6,4), etc, but I need to be at (6,5) on turn 81 to move to (5,5) on turn 82.\n\nTurn 80: at (6,1)\n\nTurn 81: move U to (6,2)\n\nTurn 82: move U to (6,3)\n\nThen on turn 82, I am at (6,3), not (6,5), so I can't reach (5,5) on turn 82.\n\nFrom (6,1) at turn 80, to (5,5) in 2 moves? Impossible, min 4 moves: e.g. (6,1) to (6,2) to (6,3) to (6,4) to (5,4) or something, but to (5,5) directly from (6,1) not possible.\n\nManhattan distance |5-6| + |5-1| =1+4=5, so at least 5 moves from (6,1) to (5,5).\n\nTurn 80,81,82,83,84.\n\nBut on turn 82, food disappears after turn, so on turn 82 it is present, but after turn 82 it disappears, so I can eat on turn 82.\n\nBut to reach on turn 82, I need to be at an adjacent cell on turn 81.\n\nFrom (6,1) at turn 80, on turn 81 I can be at (6,2) or (7,1) or (5,1) or (6,0), but (6,0) wall, (7,1) x=7 wall, (5,1) body, so only (6,2).\n\nThen on turn 82, from (6,2) to (6,3) or (5,2) etc, not to (5,5).\n\nSo I cannot reach (5,5) by turn 82 from this path.\n\nTherefore, with the current forced moves, I cannot eat any food, and I might starve or hit wall eventually.\n\nBut at turn 77, I had a choice to move to (1,1) instead of (3,1), but that is worse, going left to corner.\n\nSo perhaps at turn 73, I need to find a way to not go down, but I have no choice.\n\nUnless I can move to a cell that frees up the path.\n\nBut at turn 73, from (3,4), only (2,4) is free.\n\nPerhaps the food under body rule.\n\nFor example, there is food at (3,6), but it's not under the body, it's free, but I can't reach it.\n\nOr is there food under the body?\n\nIn the state, food positions are (3,6) and (5,5), both not under snake, I think.\n\n(3,6) is at (3,6), snake positions: head (3,4), body (3,3), (3,2), etc, no (3,6), so not under.\n\nSimilarly (5,5) not under.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps at some point, I can move to a cell that allows me to circle back.\n\nBut with the current snake position, it's blocking the way.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 73, when I move to (2,4), the cell (3,4) becomes the second segment, so if I can go back, but I can't because it's occupied.\n\nOr later.\n\nLet's list the grid at turn 73.\n\nI can make a grid map.\n\nGrid 8x8, walls at borders and (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n\nHead: (3,4)\n\nBody: (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) tail.\n\nFood: (3,6), (5,5)\n\nFree cells: for example, (2,4) is free, as we saw.\n\nAlso, (2,3) free? (2,3) not in list, free.\n\n(2,2) free, (2,1) occupied, (2,0) wall.\n\n(3,0) wall, (3,1) occupied, (3,2) occupied, (3,3) occupied, (3,4) head, (3,5) occupied, (3,6) food, (3,7) wall.\n\n(4,1) occupied, (4,2) occupied, (4,3) occupied, (4,4) occupied, (4,5) occupied, (4,6) wall, (4,7) wall.\n\n(5,1) free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\n(5,2) occupied, (5,3) occupied, (5,4) free? Not occupied, (5,5) food, (5,6) wall, (5,7) wall.\n\n(6,1) free, (6,2) free, etc.\n\nBut from (3,4), only (2,4) is free to move.\n\nSo I must move left.\n\nThen the path is forced for several turns.\n\nPerhaps after a few turns, I have choices.\n\nAt turn 77, from (2,1), I can choose to move to (3,1) or (1,1).\n\nIf I move to (1,1), then I can go up from there.\n\nFor example, from (1,1), move U to (1,2) but (1,2) is tail or body.\n\nAt turn 77, at (2,1), positions have (1,2) as tail or near tail.\n\nIn turn 76 positions, tail at (1,2).\n\nIf I move L to (1,1), then new head (1,1), then body (2,1), (2,2), etc, tail removed from (1,2), so new tail at (1,3) or something.\n\nPositions before move: [ (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) ] tail at (1,2)\n\nMove to (1,1): new positions [ (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) ] tail at (1,3)\n\nHead at (1,1), direction L (since moved left from (2,1)).\n\nTurn 78: from (1,1), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, R (cannot L, opposite or wall? L would be x=0, wall).\n\n- U: (1,2) - but (1,2) not in positions now? Positions have (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), but (1,2) removed, so free? (1,2) is not occupied, free.\n\n- D: (1,0) - y=0 wall, death\n\n- L: (0,1) - x=0 wall, death\n\n- R: (2,1) - position 1, body\n\nSo only possible move is U to (1,2).\n\nMove U to (1,2).\n\nNew head (1,2), direction U.\n\nThen turn 79: from (1,2), can move U to (1,3) or L to (0,2) wall or R to (2,2) or D to (1,1) body.\n\n- U: (1,3) - position 18? Index: 0:(1,2), 1:(1,1), 2:(2,1), 3:(2,2), 4:(2,3), 5:(2,4), 6:(3,4), 7:(3,3), 8:(3,2), 9:(4,2), 10:(5,2), 11:(5,3), 12:(4,3), 13:(4,4), 14:(4,5), 15:(3,5), 16:(2,5), 17:(1,5), 18:(1,4) tail? Let's list:\n\nAfter move to (1,2): new positions [ (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4) ] tail at (1,4)\n\n(1,3) was removed when we moved to (1,2)? When we moved to (1,2), from previous, tail was at (1,3), removed, so positions: head (1,2), then (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4) and (1,3) removed, so tail at (1,4)\n\n(1,3) is not there.\n\nSo at (1,2), adjacent:\n\n- U: (1,3) - not occupied, free\n\n- D: (1,1) - position 1, body\n\n- L: (0,2) - wall\n\n- R: (2,2) - position 3, body\n\nSo move U to (1,3)\n\nAnd so on, I can go up to (1,4), (1,5), but (1,5) is occupied, so on turn 79, from (1,3) to (1,4) if free, but (1,4) is tail or body.\n\nAt turn 79 from (1,3), etc.\n\nBut still, I am on the left side, far from (5,5).\n\nSo it seems difficult to reach the food.\n\nPerhaps I can consider the \"Tail Reward Danger\" but no food on tail.\n\nAnother thought: at turn 73, the only move is L to (2,4), so I have to do that.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I have to follow the path until I have choices.\n\nAt turn 77, I have a choice between (1,1) and (3,1).\n\nMoving to (3,1) is better because it's closer to the right side where (5,5) is.\n\nThen from there, I can try to go up when possible.\n\nBut as before, it's slow.\n\nPerhaps I can move in a way that shortens the path or something.\n\nBut with the snake body, it's tight.\n\nLet's think about the head direction and no reverse.\n\nAt turn 73, move L to (2,4), direction L.\n\nTurn 74, from (2,4), only D to (2,3), direction D.\n\nTurn 75, from (2,3), only D to (2,2), direction D.\n\nTurn 76, from (2,2), only D to (2,1), direction D.\n\nTurn 77, from (2,1), direction D, I can move L to (1,1) or R to (3,1).\n\nIf I move R to (3,1), direction R.\n\nThen turn 78, from (3,1), direction R, move R to (4,1), direction R.\n\nTurn 79, from (4,1), direction R, move R to (5,1), direction R.\n\nTurn 80, from (5,1), direction R, move R to (6,1), direction R.\n\nTurn 81, from (6,1), direction R, can move U to (6,2) (free), direction U.\n\nTurn 82, from (6,2), direction U, can move U to (6,3) (free), etc.\n\nBut (5,5) is at (5,5), and on turn 82, it disappears after, so I can't eat it.\n\nIf there is food later, but currently only two food, both will be gone.\n\nAfter that, I need to find food, but no other food, so I might starve.\n\nBut the game might spawn new food, but in this state, only these two.\n\nThe state doesn't say new food spawn, so I think only these for now.\n\nPerhaps I can eat the food if I can reach it.\n\nBut with the current situation, it's not possible.\n\nUnless at some point, a cell becomes free.\n\nFor example, when the tail moves, cells free up.\n\nIn the initial snake, the tail is at (4,1), and it's moving.\n\nIn my path, when I go to (2,1), the tail is at (1,2), then moving to (1,3), etc.\n\nThe cell (3,5) is occupied until the tail reaches it, which is late.\n\nSimilarly, for (5,5), if I can go to (5,4) or something.\n\n(5,4) is free, but I need to access it.\n\nFrom (5,1), I can't go to (5,2) because occupied.\n\nBut if I wait, (5,2) might free up.\n\nLet's estimate when (5,2) is freed.\n\nIn the initial snake, (5,2) is segment 5.\n\nAfter each move, it moves towards the tail.\n\nBut in my path, the snake is elongating in a way, but the relative position.\n\nFor example, at turn 73, after move, positions have (5,2) at index 5.\n\nAt turn 74, index 6 or so.\n\nIn my earlier list, at turn 76, (5,2) is index 6.\n\nThe tail is at index 18.\n\nSo it will be freed when it becomes the tail, after 12 moves.\n\nFrom turn 76, after 12 moves, turn 88, too late.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, with the current state, I cannot eat any food, and I am forced to move in a way that I might hit a wall or body eventually, but in the short term, I can survive by moving to free cells.\n\nFor example, from (6,1), I can go up to (6,2), (6,3), etc, to (6,6), but y=7 wall, so (6,6), then to (5,6) wall, or (7,6) wall, or (6,5), etc.\n\nBut no food, so I need to find a way.\n\nPerhaps at turn 73, I can consider that moving L is the only way, so I have to do that, and for the answer, I need to output the actions for the next few turns.\n\nThe answer format is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc, up to some point.\n\nBut it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", so I need to plan multiple turns.\n\nBut in this case, for the first few turns, I have only one choice.\n\nSo for turn 73: move L\n\nTurn 74: move D\n\nTurn 75: move D\n\nTurn 76: move D\n\nTurn 77: move R (to (3,1), better than L to (1,1))\n\nThen turn 78: move R to (4,1)\n\nTurn 79: move R to (5,1)\n\nTurn 80: move R to (6,1)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut for the answer, I can output for 5 turns or more.\n\nSince the food is not reachable, I should focus on survival and look for opportunities.\n\nBut in this state, no other food.\n\nPerhaps the snake can eat its own tail or something, but no, collision.\n\nAnother idea: the \"Tail Reward Danger\" but no food on tail.\n\nOr if I can manuever to free cells.\n\nAt turn 77, when I move to (3,1), the cell (1,2) is freed, but not helpful.\n\nI think I have to accept that for now, I can only move as above.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\nTurn 73: L\n\nTurn 74: D\n\nTurn 75: D\n\nTurn 76: D\n\nTurn 77: R  (to (3,1))\n\nThen for turn 78: from (3,1), move R to (4,1)\n\nTurn 79: from (4,1), move R to (5,1)\n\netc.\n\nBut for the box, I need to output a sequence.\n\nSince the problem says \"maximize score\", but here I can't eat, so survival is key.\n\nPerhaps at some point, new food spawns, but not specified.\n\nSo I'll go with the safe moves.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 73: L\n\nTurn 74: D\n\nTurn 75: D\n\nTurn 76: D\n\nTurn 77: R\n\nThen for 5+ turns, I can add more.\n\nTurn 78: R (to (4,1))\n\nTurn 79: R (to (5,1))\n\nTurn 80: R (to (6,1))\n\nTurn 81: U (from (6,1) to (6,2), assuming free)\n\nTurn 82: U ( to (6,3))\n\netc.\n\nBut for the answer, I think output for turns 73 to 77 or more.\n\nThe format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I can do for several turns.\n\nSince thinking 5 turns ahead, output 5 actions.\n\nBut t1=73, so turns 73 to 77.\n\nAt turn 77, I have a choice, but I chose R.\n\nIn the state, at turn 73, I must move L, etc.\n\nSo for the box:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 73: L\nTurn 74: D\nTurn 75: D\nTurn 76: D\nTurn 77: R\n}\n\nBut let's confirm the directions.\n\nTurn 73: from (3,4) U, move L to (2,4)\n\nTurn 74: from (2,4) direction L? After moving L, new direction is L.\n\nThen move D to (2,3), so action D.\n\nTurn 75: from (2,3) direction D, move D to (2,2)\n\nTurn 76: from (2,2) direction D, move D to (2,1)\n\nTurn 77: from (2,1) direction D, move R to (3,1)\n\nActions: L, D, D, D, R\n\nYes.\n\nTo think ahead, after that, I can move to (4,1), etc.\n\nBut for the answer, this should be fine.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan for Snake Movement\n\nThe current state at turn 73 presents significant challenges due to the snake's long body (19 segments) blocking most immediate paths, and the available food (both positive) being difficult to reach within their life spans while avoiding collisions. Key constraints:\n- **Food availability**: \n  - Food at (3,6) has life span 7, meaning it disappears after turn 79 (life span decreases each turn, including turn 73: 7 → 6 after turn 73, ..., 0 after turn 79, gone on turn 80).\n  - Food at (5,5) has life span 10, disappearing after turn 82 (gone on turn 83).\n- **Snake position and body blocks**: \n  - Head at (3,4) with direction Up. Only safe move is Left to (2,4) due to body segments blocking Up, Down, and Right.\n  - The snake's body occupies critical paths to both food items, making it impossible to reach (3,6) before it expires (Manhattan distance from current position is 2, but body blocks require detours; minimum 6 moves needed, but only 6 turns until expiration—insufficient time). \n  - Reaching (5,5) is theoretically possible by turn 82 (Manhattan distance 7, 9 turns available), but the body blocks direct routes, forcing a long detour. Simulation shows (5,5) cannot be reached by turn 82 due to body occupancy (e.g., (5,2) and (5,3) remain occupied until later turns).\n- **Movement constraints**: \n  - No instant reverse: After moving Left at turn 73, Down is not opposite, so it can be chosen. Subsequent moves are constrained by body and walls.\n  - **Forced path initially**: From turn 73 to 76, only one safe move per turn exists due to body blocks. At turn 77, a choice emerges between Left to (1,1) or Right to (3,1). Moving Right is better for long-term survival as it avoids the bottom-left corner and stays closer to the center/grid space.\n- **Long-term survival focus**: \n  - With no food reachable soon, prioritize avoiding collisions and maintaining maneuverability. \n  - After turn 77, moving Right and then Up/East opens access to the right side of the grid, where new food may spawn (though not specified). \n  - **5+ turn simulation**:\n    - Turn 73: Must move Left (only safe cell).\n    - Turn 74: Only safe move Down.\n    - Turn 75: Only safe move Down.\n    - Turn 76: Only safe move Down.\n    - Turn 77: Choice between Left or Right; Right chosen to position near (3,1) for better access to eastern grid.\n    - Turn 78: From (3,1), move Right to (4,1) (only safe move).\n    - Turn 79: From (4,1), move Right to (5,1) (only safe move).\n    - Turn 80: From (5,1), move Right to (6,1) (only safe move, avoids body and walls).\n    - Beyond: Continue Up to (6,2), etc., to explore for new food.\n\nGiven the analysis, the sequence for turns 73-80 is determined, with actions focused on survival since no food is reachable within the 5+ turn horizon. The plan ensures no collisions with walls or body.\n\n### Answer: Action Sequence\nThe actions for turns 73 to 80 are as follows, with detailed reasoning embedded:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 73: L \\\\\nTurn 74: D \\\\\nTurn 75: D \\\\\nTurn 76: D \\\\\nTurn 77: R \\\\\nTurn 78: R \\\\\nTurn 79: R \\\\\nTurn 80: R\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 74. The grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7, and an internal obstacle at (4,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders and (4,6) is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: head at (2,4), then body segments: (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1). That's 19 segments. Let me list them in order:\n\n- Head: (2,4)\n\n- Next: (3,4)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (4,2)\n\n- (5,2)\n\n- (5,3)\n\n- (4,3)  // here it turns\n\n- (4,4)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (3,5)\n\n- (2,5)\n\n- (1,5)\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (1,3)\n\n- (1,2)\n\n- (1,1)\n\n- (2,1)\n\n- Tail: (3,1)\n\nSnake head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to reach (2,4) from previous position. Since head is at (2,4) and direction is L, it came from the right, so previous head was (3,4) before moving left to (2,4). But (3,4) is the first body segment now.\n\nFood: two items:\n\n1. (3,6) with life span 6, value 1 (positive food)\n\n2. (5,5) with life span 9, value 1 (positive food)\n\nBoth are positive food, no negative food mentioned.\n\nLife span: for (3,6), life span 6, meaning it disappears after 6 turns including the current one. Similarly for (5,5), life span 9.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for turns 74, 75, 76, etc., thinking at least 5 turns ahead. Prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid. Walls are at:\n\n- x=0 (left border)\n\n- x=7 (right border)\n\n- y=0 (bottom border)\n\n- y=7 (top border)\n\n- Internal obstacle at (4,6)\n\nSo cells like (0,y) for all y, (7,y) for all y, (x,0) for all x, (x,7) for all x are walls. And (4,6) is blocked.\n\nAvailable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except where snake or obstacles are.\n\nSnake occupies: let's list all positions to avoid.\n\n(2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1)\n\nSo the snake is coiled around, and head is at (2,4) moving left.\n\nCurrent direction is L, so from (2,4), possible moves: since direction is L, I can't move right instantly because of no instant reverse. So possible moves: U, D, L. But L would be continuing left, U is up, D is down.\n\nLet's see what cells are around (2,4):\n\n- Left: (1,4) — but (1,4) is occupied by snake body? (1,4) is in positions: index 13 in list, which is (1,4), yes, part of body.\n\nSnake positions: (1,4) is the 14th segment? Let's index:\n\n0: (2,4) head\n\n1: (3,4)\n\n2: (3,3)\n\n3: (3,2)\n\n4: (4,2)\n\n5: (5,2)\n\n6: (5,3)\n\n7: (4,3)\n\n8: (4,4)\n\n9: (4,5)\n\n10: (3,5)\n\n11: (2,5)\n\n12: (1,5)\n\n13: (1,4)  // this is (1,4)\n\n14: (1,3)\n\netc.\n\nSo (1,4) is occupied by body, so moving left to (1,4) would cause collision because head touches body segment.\n\nSimilarly, down: (2,3) — is that occupied? Let's see positions: (2,3) not in list. Positions have (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), but no (2,3). (2,3) is free?\n\ny-coordinates: from 1 to 5, but (2,3) not mentioned, so probably free.\n\nSimilarly, up: (2,5) — (2,5) is in positions, index 11, so occupied.\n\n(2,5) is body segment.\n\nSo from head (2,4):\n\n- Left: (1,4) — occupied by body, collision\n\n- Right: (3,4) — but (3,4) is the first body segment, and since direction is L, moving right would be reverse, which is not allowed because no instant reverse. Rule: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Current direction is L, so moving R (right) is opposite, not allowed.\n\n- Up: (2,5) — occupied by body (index 11, (2,5))\n\n- Down: (2,3) — not occupied, and not wall? Walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders, so y=3 is between 1 and 6, x=2 between 1 and 6, and not (4,6), so (2,3) should be free.\n\n(2,3): x=2, y=3. Walls: borders at x=0,7 y=0,7, so (2,3) is within bounds. Internal obstacle (4,6), so (2,3) is clear.\n\nSo only possible move from (2,4) is down to (2,3), because:\n\n- Left: occupied, collision\n\n- Right: reverse, not allowed\n\n- Up: occupied\n\n- Down: free\n\nIs that right? Let me confirm.\n\nHead at (2,4), direction L (left).\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- L to (1,4): but (1,4) is occupied by snake body, so if I move there, head collides with body, death.\n\n- R to (3,4): but moving right is opposite to current left direction, so not allowed by no instant reverse rule.\n\n- U to (2,5): (2,5) is occupied by snake body (part of the tail), so collision.\n\n- D to (2,3): appears free, no wall, no snake.\n\nSo indeed, only possible move is down to (2,3).\n\nBut that seems dangerous? Let me see the grid.\n\nPerhaps I should sketch the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid from x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7. Walls: all border cells, so cells like (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7), and (4,6).\n\nAvailable: inner 6x6, but with snake and obstacles.\n\nx from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (4,6) wall.\n\nSnake positions:\n\nLet me list coordinates:\n\nHead: (2,4)\n\nThen: (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1)\n\nSo the snake is long, 19 segments.\n\nAt (2,4), moving down to (2,3) seems possible.\n\nBut (2,3) is free now, but after moving, what happens?\n\nAfter move, head moves to (2,3), and tail moves forward, so the segment at tail (3,1) will be removed, and a new segment added at head, so snake grows only if eating food, but no food at (2,3), so length same.\n\nNow, food: (3,6) and (5,5)\n\n(3,6): x=3,y=6. But y=6, and walls at y=7 and y=0, but y=6 is not wall? Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is within bounds, x=3, not obstacle, so (3,6) is a valid cell.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) is valid.\n\nLife span: (3,6) life span 6, meaning it will disappear after 6 turns including turn 74. So on turn 74, it exists; turn 75, life span 5; ... turn 79, life span 0, disappears after turn 79? Let's see.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 74, life span 6, so it will disappear after N turns, meaning it exists for this turn and the next 5 turns? Standard way: if life span is N at turn t, it exists from turn t to turn t + N - 1, and disappears at turn t + N.\n\nFor example, at turn t, life span N, it can be eaten on turn t. On turn t+1, life span N-1, and so on, until life span 1 on turn t+N-1, then on turn t+N, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly here: for (3,6), at turn 74, life span 6, so exists from turn 74 to 79 (since 74 to 79 is 6 turns: 74,75,76,77,78,79), disappears at turn 80.\n\nTurn 74: life span 6\n\nTurn 75: life span 5\n\n...\n\nTurn 79: life span 1\n\nTurn 80: gone\n\nSimilarly for (5,5): life span 9 at turn 74, exists to turn 82 (74 to 82 is 9 turns: 74,75,...,82), gone at turn 83.\n\nNow, back to movement.\n\nAt turn 74, head at (2,4), only possible move is down to (2,3), as we thought.\n\nBut let's confirm if there are other options. Is there any way? No, because other directions are blocked or forbidden.\n\nSo for turn 74, action must be D (down) to (2,3).\n\nNow, after this move, what happens?\n\nTurn 74: move D to (2,3)\n\nNew head position: (2,3)\n\nSnake grows? No, since no food at (2,3), so tail moves: the last segment, (3,1) is removed.\n\nNew snake positions: head at (2,3), then the old head (2,4) becomes body, then (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), and tail was (3,1) removed, so the new tail is (2,1)? Let's list:\n\nAfter move: new head (2,3), then previous positions except tail removed.\n\nSnake was: positions [ (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1) ]\n\nAfter moving head to (2,3), and since no food, tail (3,1) is removed. So new positions: [ (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1) ]\n\nNow tail is (2,1).\n\nDirection: since I moved down, new head direction is D (down).\n\nNow, for turn 75, head at (2,3), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: from (2,3), direction down.\n\nCan move: U, D, L, R? But no instant reverse.\n\nCurrent direction D (down), so cannot move U (up), because opposite.\n\nPossible: D (down), L (left), R (right).\n\nNow, cells around (2,3):\n\n- Down: (2,2) — is this free? Not in snake positions, and walls: y=2, x=2, not border, not obstacle, so should be free.\n\n- Left: (1,3) — (1,3) is in snake positions, index 14 in new list? New positions: head (2,3), then (2,4), (3,4), ..., down to (1,1), (2,1).\n\n(1,3) is in the list: from above, positions include (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), etc. Specifically, (1,3) is there.\n\n- Right: (3,3) — (3,3) is also in snake positions, index 3 or so.\n\nList: index 0: (2,3) head\n\nIndex 1: (2,4)\n\nIndex 2: (3,4)\n\nIndex 3: (3,3)\n\nYes, (3,3) is index 3, body segment.\n\n- Up: (2,4) — but (2,4) is now the first body segment, index 1, so occupied.\n\nAlso, moving up is opposite to current down direction, so not allowed anyway.\n\nSo possible moves:\n\n- D to (2,2): free? (2,2) not in positions, not wall, so free.\n\n- L to (1,3): but (1,3) is occupied by body, collision.\n\n- R to (3,3): occupied by body, collision.\n\nTherefore, only possible move is down to (2,2).\n\nIs that right? (2,2) should be free.\n\nLet me confirm snake positions: (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), etc. (3,2) is there, but (2,2) is not listed, so yes, free.\n\nWalls: no.\n\nSo turn 75, must move D to (2,2).\n\nNow, after move: head to (2,2), no food there, so tail moves: last segment (2,1) removed.\n\nNew positions: [ (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) ] tail is (1,1)\n\nDirection: moved down, so head direction D.\n\nNow turn 76, head at (2,2), direction D.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- D to (2,1): (2,1) is not in positions? New positions: (1,1) is tail, but (2,1) is not there. Previously (2,1) was removed? After turn 75 move, positions are [ (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) ]\n\nSo (2,1) is not occupied, and (2,1) is within bounds? x=2,y=1, y=1 is not wall, since walls y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is ok.\n\n(2,1) free.\n\n- L to (1,2): (1,2) is in positions, index 17? List: index 0: (2,2) head, 1: (2,3), 2: (2,4), 3: (3,4), 4: (3,3), 5: (3,2), 6: (4,2), 7: (5,2), 8: (5,3), 9: (4,3), 10: (4,4), 11: (4,5), 12: (3,5), 13: (2,5), 14: (1,5), 15: (1,4), 16: (1,3), 17: (1,2), 18: (1,1) tail.\n\nSo (1,2) is index 17, occupied.\n\n- R to (3,2): (3,2) is index 5, occupied.\n\n- U to (2,3): but (2,3) is index 1, first body segment, occupied. Also, moving up is opposite to down, not allowed.\n\nSo only possible move is D to (2,1).\n\n(2,1) free? Yes.\n\nSo turn 76, move D to (2,1).\n\nNo food, tail (1,1) removed.\n\nNew positions: head (2,1), then (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) ] tail is (1,2)\n\nDirection D.\n\nNow head at (2,1), direction D.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- D to (2,0): but y=0 is wall, since borders, so wall collision, death. Cannot.\n\n- L to (1,1): (1,1) is not in positions? New positions: head (2,1), then (2,2), ..., down to (1,2), (1,3), etc. (1,1) is not there; tail is (1,2), and before that (1,3), no (1,1). (1,1) was removed earlier.\n\n(1,1) was tail at some point, but after turn 76 move, positions: from above, after moving to (2,1), and tail (1,1) removed, but (1,1) was tail, now removed, so (1,1) is free? But walls: x=0,y=0 is wall, but (1,1) is x=1,y=1, which is not border wall. Border walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (1,1) is inner, should be free if not occupied.\n\nIn positions, (1,1) is not listed, so free.\n\n- R to (3,1): (3,1) not in positions? Positions have (3,2), (3,3), etc., but not (3,1). (3,1) was tail long ago, but now free.\n\n- U to (2,2): but (2,2) is index 1, body segment, occupied. Also opposite direction, not allowed.\n\nCurrent direction D, so:\n\n- D: (2,0) wall, invalid\n\n- U: opposite, not allowed\n\n- L: (1,1) — is it free? Let's see.\n\n(1,1): x=1,y=1, not wall, not in current snake positions, so free.\n\n- R: (3,1) — x=3,y=1, not wall, not occupied, free.\n\nSo possible moves: L to (1,1) or R to (3,1).\n\nNot only down, but L and R possible.\n\nNow, we have choices.\n\nBut we need to think ahead to get food or avoid risks.\n\nFood is at (3,6) and (5,5).\n\n(3,6) is above, (5,5) is to the right.\n\nCurrently head at (2,1), which is bottom left area.\n\nIf I move left to (1,1), or right to (3,1).\n\nMoving to (1,1) might be cornering myself, but let's see.\n\nFirst, life span: (3,6) life span at turn 74 was 6, so at turn 75, life span 5; turn 76, life span 4? Let's track.\n\nTurn 74: (3,6) life span 6\n\nAfter turn 74, we moved to turn 75.\n\nAt turn 75, (3,6) life span decreases to 5.\n\nSimilarly, turn 76, life span 4.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) at turn 74 life span 9, turn 75:8, turn 76:7, etc.\n\nNow turn 76, head at (2,1), we need to move.\n\nOptions: L to (1,1) or R to (3,1).\n\nIf I go left to (1,1), then from there, possible moves: from (1,1), direction would be L? If I move L from (2,1) to (1,1), direction left.\n\nThen at (1,1), can move L, D, U? But x=1, left would be (0,1) which is wall, since x=0 border. Cannot.\n\nDown: (1,0) wall, cannot.\n\nUp: (1,2) — but (1,2) is in snake positions, body segment.\n\nRight: (2,1) but (2,1) is previous head, now body, occupied. Also, moving right might be opposite if direction is L, but let's not assume direction yet.\n\nIf I move L to (1,1) from (2,1), with previous direction D, but after move, new direction is L.\n\nThen at (1,1), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: cannot move R (opposite), cannot move L (wall), cannot move D (wall), only U to (1,2), but (1,2) is occupied by snake body, so collision. Dead end.\n\nTherefore, moving to (1,1) is suicidal; I would be trapped and die.\n\nTherefore, I must move right to (3,1) at turn 76.\n\nSo action R.\n\nThen head to (3,1), no food, tail moves: last segment (1,2) removed? Positions after turn 76 move: head to (3,1), tail (1,2) removed? Let's list current before move.\n\nAt turn 76 start: positions [ (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) ] tail (1,2)\n\nMove R to (3,1): new head (3,1), then previous positions except tail removed, so new positions: [ (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) ] tail is (1,3)\n\nDirection: moved right, so head direction R.\n\nNow turn 77, head at (3,1), direction R.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- R to (4,1) — is it free? (4,1) not in positions, not wall (x=4,y=1 ok), free.\n\n- L to (2,1) — (2,1) is index 1, body segment, occupied. Also, moving left opposite to right, not allowed.\n\n- U to (3,2) — (3,2) is index 7, body segment, occupied.\n\n- D to (3,0) — wall, cannot.\n\nSo only possible move is R to (4,1).\n\nMust move R.\n\nTurn 77: R to (4,1)\n\nNo food, tail (1,3) removed.\n\nNew positions: head (4,1), then (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4) ] tail (1,4)\n\nDirection R.\n\nNow turn 78, head at (4,1), direction R.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- R to (5,1) — free? (5,1) not occupied, not wall.\n\n- L to (3,1) — (3,1) is index 1, body, occupied. Opposite, not allowed.\n\n- U to (4,2) — (4,2) is index 9, body segment, occupied.\n\n- D to (4,0) wall, cannot.\n\nSo only move R to (5,1).\n\nTurn 78: R to (5,1)\n\nNo food, tail (1,4) removed.\n\nNew positions: head (5,1), then (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5) ] tail (1,5)\n\nDirection R.\n\nNow turn 79, head at (5,1), direction R.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- R to (6,1) — free? (6,1) x=6,y=1, not wall, not occupied.\n\n- L to (4,1) — (4,1) index 1, body, occupied. Opposite, not allowed.\n\n- U to (5,2) — (5,2) is index 11, body segment, occupied.\n\n- D to (5,0) wall, cannot.\n\nSo only move R to (6,1).\n\nTurn 79: R to (6,1)\n\nNo food, tail (1,5) removed.\n\nNew positions: head (6,1), then (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) ] tail (2,5)\n\nDirection R.\n\nNow turn 80, head at (6,1), direction R.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- R to (7,1) — but x=7 is wall, cannot.\n\n- L to (5,1) — (5,1) index 1, body, occupied. Opposite, not allowed.\n\n- U to (6,2) — free? (6,2) not occupied, not wall.\n\n- D to (6,0) wall, cannot.\n\nSo only move U to (6,2).\n\nTurn 80: U to (6,2)\n\nNo food, tail (2,5) removed.\n\nNew positions: head (6,2), then (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5) ] tail (3,5)\n\nDirection U (up).\n\nNow, we have been moving without eating, and the snake is getting shorter? From 19 segments, after several moves, tail removed each time, so shorter.\n\nAt turn 80, positions: 19 segments? From head to tail, 19 cells, but since no food eaten, length should be same, 19.\n\nInitial: 19 segments.\n\nAfter each move without food, tail removed, so length decreases? No: when no food, head moves to new cell, tail is removed, so snake length remains the same, but the body shifts.\n\nIn terms of number of segments, it should be constant unless eating food.\n\nInitial: 19 segments.\n\nAfter turn 74 move: head to (2,3), tail (3,1) removed, so segments: 19, same.\n\nSimilarly each time, no food, so length 19 always.\n\nIn turn 80 positions, from (6,2) to (3,5), let's count: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5) — 19 positions, yes.\n\nNow, food: (3,6) life span: at turn 74, span 6, so turn 79: span 1, exists, turn 80: should disappear? Turn 74: span 6, turn 75:5, t76:4, t77:3, t78:2, t79:1, so at turn 79 it exists with span 1, can be eaten. Turn 80, it disappears, so not available.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) at turn 74 span 9, so turn 75:8, t76:7, t77:6, t78:5, t79:4, t80:3, etc.\n\nAt turn 80, (3,6) is gone, only (5,5) with span 3 (since t80: span 3 if t74 span9, t74:9, t75:8, t76:7, t77:6, t78:5, t79:4, t80:3, yes.\n\nBut (3,6) gone.\n\nNow head at (6,2), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: up, down, left, right? No instant reverse.\n\nCurrent direction U, so cannot move D (down).\n\nPossible: U, L, R.\n\nCells:\n\n- U to (6,3) — free? (6,3) not occupied, not wall.\n\n- D: opposite, not allowed.\n\n- L to (5,2) — (5,2) is in positions, index 13? Positions: head (6,2), then (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)\n\n(5,2) is index 13, body segment, occupied.\n\n- R to (7,2) — x=7 wall, cannot.\n\nSo only move U to (6,3).\n\nMust move U.\n\nTurn 80: U to (6,3)\n\nNo food, tail (3,5) removed.\n\nNew positions: head (6,3), then (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) ] tail (4,5)\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 81, head at (6,3), direction U.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U to (6,4) — free? (6,4) not occupied, not wall.\n\n- D: opposite, not allowed.\n\n- L to (5,3) — (5,3) is index 15, body segment, occupied.\n\n- R to (7,3) wall, cannot.\n\nSo only U to (6,4).\n\nTurn 81: U to (6,4)\n\nNo food, tail (4,5) removed.\n\nNew positions: head (6,4), then (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) ] tail (4,4)\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 82, head at (6,4), direction U.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U to (6,5) — free? (6,5) not occupied, not wall.\n\n- D: not allowed.\n\n- L to (5,4) — (5,4) not in positions? Positions have (5,3), (5,2), but not (5,4). So free.\n\n- R wall.\n\nSo now I have choices: U to (6,5) or L to (5,4).\n\nNot forced.\n\nAlso, food (5,5) is at (5,5), which is close.\n\nAt turn 82, (5,5) life span: since t74 span9, t82: span? t74:9, t75:8, t76:7, t77:6, t78:5, t79:4, t80:3, t81:2, t82:1, so exists, can be eaten.\n\nIf I go to (5,4), I can then go up to (5,5) to eat.\n\nBut need to check if possible.\n\nFirst, from (6,4), direction U.\n\nOptions: U to (6,5) or L to (5,4).\n\nIf I move L to (5,4), then head to (5,4), direction L? Previous direction U, moving left, so new direction L.\n\nThen at (5,4), can move to (5,5) up, since (5,5) is food.\n\nBut need to see if it's safe.\n\n(5,5) is food, and snake not there yet.\n\nBut Tail Reward Danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it kills.\n\nBut here, tail is at (4,4), which is not (5,5), so not adjacent to head if head at (5,4)? Head at (5,4), tail at (4,4), are they adjacent? (5,4) and (4,4) share an edge, so yes, adjacent.\n\nIf I move to (5,4), head at (5,4), tail at (4,4), adjacent.\n\nNow, if I eat food at (5,5), I need to move to (5,5).\n\nBut (5,5) has food, so if I eat it, snake grows, so tail doesn't move, new segment added.\n\nBut Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and newly grown tail collide.\n\nIn this case, tail cell is (4,4), which has no food, food is at (5,5).\n\nThe danger is only if the tail cell itself has food that is about to be eaten, but here tail cell is (4,4), no food.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nI can move to (5,4), then to (5,5) to eat.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nFirst, at turn 82, head (6,4), direction U.\n\nI can choose L to (5,4) or U to (6,5).\n\nIf I go U to (6,5), then from there, I might go to (6,6) or left, but (6,6) is y=6, not wall, but then I need to get to (5,5).\n\nBut (5,5) might disappear soon? At turn 82, life span 1, so after turn 82, it disappears? At turn 82, life span 1, so it exists, can be eaten on turn 82. If not eaten, on turn 83 it disappears.\n\nSo if I don't eat on turn 82, I miss it.\n\nNow, from (6,4), if I move L to (5,4), then on turn 82, head to (5,4), no food there, so tail moves: tail (4,4) removed? Positions: before move, head (6,4), tail (4,4)\n\nAfter move to (5,4): new head (5,4), then (6,4), (6,3), etc., and tail (4,4) removed, so new tail is (4,3)? Positions: [ (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3) ] tail (4,3)\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen on turn 83, head at (5,4), direction L.\n\nNow, (5,5) is above, so I can move U to (5,5).\n\n(5,5) is free? And has food.\n\nIf I move U, to (5,5), eat food, since positive, snake grows, so tail does not move.\n\nNew head at (5,5), and the segment at (5,4) becomes body, etc.\n\nBut at turn 83, (5,5) food may be gone? At turn 82, (5,5) span 1, so eaten or not, after turn 82, it disappears, so on turn 83, no food at (5,5).\n\nI missed it.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt turn 82, if I move to (5,4), I don't eat on turn 82.\n\nThe food (5,5) can only be eaten on turn 82 if I move directly to it.\n\nBut from (6,4), I can't move directly to (5,5); only adjacent moves.\n\n(6,4) to (5,5) is diagonal, not allowed; only U, D, L, R.\n\nSo from (6,4), to reach (5,5), I need to go to (5,4) or (6,5) first.\n\nIf I go to (6,5) on turn 82, then from (6,5), I can go to (5,5) on turn 83, but on turn 83, food is gone.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (5,4) on turn 82, then to (5,5) on turn 83, food gone.\n\nSo I cannot eat (5,5) at all? But at turn 82, I can eat it only if I am at an adjacent cell and move to it.\n\nBut from current position (6,4), (5,5) is not adjacent; adjacent cells are (6,5), (6,3), (5,4), (7,4) but wall.\n\n(6,4) to (5,5) is not horizontal or vertical adjacent; it's diagonal.\n\nSo I cannot move directly to (5,5) from (6,4).\n\nThe only way to eat (5,5) is to be at (5,4), (6,5), (5,6), or (4,5) on turn 82 and move to it.\n\nBut at turn 82, I am at (6,4), not adjacent.\n\n(6,4) and (5,5) are not adjacent; (6,4) to (5,4) is left, (6,4) to (6,5) is up, (5,5) is up-left from (6,4).\n\nSo not reachable in one move.\n\nTherefore, I cannot eat (5,5) because I am not adjacent at turn 82, and after that it disappears.\n\nBut is that true? Let's confirm the turns.\n\nAt turn 82, (5,5) has life span 1, so it exists during turn 82 and can be eaten if head moves to it on turn 82.\n\nBut for that, head must be on a cell adjacent to (5,5) at the start of turn 82, and choose to move to (5,5).\n\nAt start of turn 82, head is at (6,4), which is not adjacent to (5,5).\n\nAdjacent cells to (5,5) are: (5,4), (5,6), (4,5), (6,5).\n\nNone of these is occupied by head at turn 82 start.\n\nHead is at (6,4), which is not adjacent.\n\nTherefore, I cannot move to (5,5) on turn 82, and since it disappears after turn 82, I miss it.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) is already gone.\n\nSo no food to eat, I just need to survive.\n\nBut earlier at turn 82, I have a choice at (6,4): move U to (6,5) or L to (5,4).\n\nIf I move U to (6,5), then from (6,5), direction U.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (6,6), L to (5,5), but (5,5) is not there on turn 83, so only U or D or R, but R wall, D to (6,4) opposite not allowed, so U to (6,6) or L to (5,5), but (5,5) gone, so only U to (6,6) if possible.\n\n(6,6) is not wall, y=6<7.\n\nThen from there, etc.\n\nIf I move L to (5,4) on turn 82, then to (5,5) on turn 83 but food gone, so move to (5,5) or other.\n\nBut since no food, just move around.\n\nBut let's go back to the beginning.\n\nAt turn 74, I had to move down, but perhaps I missed something.\n\nAt turn 74, head at (2,4), only move down to (2,3), then down to (2,2), etc., and I ended up in the bottom right.\n\nBut there was food at (3,6) which I could have tried to get.\n\nAt turn 74, (3,6) was available, but from (2,4), I couldn't move to it because not adjacent and blocked.\n\nFrom (2,4), (3,6) is not adjacent; it's up-right.\n\nSo I couldn't move directly.\n\nAnd with the constraints, I had to move down.\n\nBut at turn 74, is there a way to avoid going down immediately? No, as per earlier analysis.\n\nUnless I can move differently, but I think not.\n\nPerhaps later on, at turn 76, when I was at (2,1), I moved right, but that was the only choice.\n\nAt turn 76, head at (2,1), I moved right to (3,1), but moving left to (1,1) was suicide, so no choice.\n\nSo I think I couldn't reach the food in time.\n\nNow, for the future, at turn 82, I need to choose.\n\nSince no food, I need to survive.\n\nAt turn 82, head at (6,4), direction U.\n\nMove to (6,5) or to (5,4).\n\nIf I move to (6,5), then at (6,5), direction U.\n\nThen at turn 83, head (6,5), can move U to (6,6), or L to (5,5), but (5,5) gone, so U to (6,6) or D, but D opposite not allowed, or R wall, so only U to (6,6) if possible.\n\n(6,6) is free, not wall.\n\nMove U to (6,6).\n\nThen from (6,6), direction U.\n\nThen turn 84, head (6,6), can move U to (6,7) but y=7 wall, cannot; D to (6,5) opposite not allowed; L to (5,6); R wall.\n\nSo only L to (5,6).\n\nMove to (5,6).\n\nThen from there, etc.\n\nIf at turn 82 I move L to (5,4), then at (5,4), direction L.\n\nThen turn 83, head (5,4), can move U to (5,5) but food gone, so (5,5) free, move there or other.\n\nBut (5,5) is free now, no food.\n\nMove U to (5,5), then from (5,5), can move to other places.\n\nBut no food, so similar.\n\nTo maximize score, I need to find food, but both foods are gone or missed.\n\nThere might be new food spawning, but the state doesn't say, so I think only these two foods are present.\n\nSo for now, I should focus on not dying.\n\nBut in the sequence, I need to output actions for turn 74 onwards.\n\nThe question is to think 5+ turns ahead, but since from turn 74, I have to move in a certain way for the first few turns, and then at turn 82 I have a choice.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions starting from turn 74.\n\nFrom turn 74 to 81, I have determined actions:\n\nTurn 74: D\n\nTurn 75: D\n\nTurn 76: R\n\nTurn 77: R\n\nTurn 78: R\n\nTurn 79: R\n\nTurn 80: U\n\nTurn 81: U\n\nThen at turn 82, I can choose U or L.\n\nSince no food, and to avoid risks, moving to (6,5) might be better because (5,4) is closer to the body.\n\nBut let's see the positions at turn 82.\n\nAt turn 82 start: head (6,4), positions as above.\n\nIf I move U to (6,5), then head to (6,5), tail (4,4) removed, so new positions: head (6,5), then (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) but (4,4) removed? Tail was (4,4), removed, so new tail is (4,3).\n\nPositions: [ (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3) ] tail (4,3)\n\nThen from (6,5), move U to (6,6) as before.\n\nSimilarly, if I move L to (5,4) on turn 82, positions: head (5,4), then (6,4), (6,3), etc., tail (4,4) removed, new tail (4,3), same as above except head at (5,4) instead of (6,5).\n\nThen from (5,4), I can move to (5,5) or other.\n\nBut since no food, it doesn't matter.\n\nPerhaps moving to (5,4) then to (5,5) might open up more space.\n\nBut I think for survival, both are fine.\n\nBut let's think about the internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is wall, so cannot go there.\n\nAt this point, since I have to output actions, and for turn 82, I can choose, say, to move U to (6,5) to go up.\n\nBut in the initial plan, I need to output for several turns.\n\nThe answer format is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't specify how many, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", probably output for 5 turns or so.\n\nBut from turn 74, I can output up to turn 78 or 79.\n\nLet's list the actions I have:\n\nTurn 74: D\n\nTurn 75: D\n\nTurn 76: R\n\nTurn 77: R\n\nTurn 78: R\n\nTurn 79: R\n\nThen turn 80: U\n\nTurn 81: U\n\nFor turn 82, I can say U or L, but to be specific, let's choose U to (6,5).\n\nThen turn 83: from (6,5) U to (6,6)\n\nTurn 84: from (6,6) L to (5,6)\n\netc.\n\nBut since the food is missed, and no other food, it's fine.\n\nBut earlier at turn 74, is there any way to get the food?\n\nFor example, at turn 74, head at (2,4), only move down.\n\nBut perhaps later, when I was at (2,1), I had to move right.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (3,6) could be eaten if I can reach it.\n\nAt turn 74, (3,6) is at (3,6), head at (2,4), not adjacent.\n\nTo reach (3,6), I need to go via (2,5) or (3,5) or (2,6), but (2,5) is occupied, (3,5) occupied, (2,6) might be free but not adjacent to head.\n\nFrom (2,4), I can only go to (2,3), then from there, to (2,2), etc., away from (3,6).\n\nSo impossible to reach in time.\n\nSimilarly for (5,5).\n\nSo I think I have to accept that.\n\nFor the answer, I can output the actions from turn 74.\n\nBut at turn 82, I have a choice, but for the output, I need to specify.\n\nSince the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", and turn 74 to 78 is 5 turns, or to 79.\n\nLet's output for 5 turns: turn 74 to 78.\n\nFrom above:\n\nTurn 74: D\n\nTurn 75: D\n\nTurn 76: R\n\nTurn 77: R\n\nTurn 78: R\n\nBut at turn 78, head is at (5,1), etc.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nPerhaps I should include up to where I have no choice.\n\nBut for the box, I need to write the actions.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 74, the snake is long, and there might be food under the body, but the food listed are at (3,6) and (5,5), which are not under snake, I think.\n\n(3,6) is not occupied, (5,5) not occupied.\n\nIn the positions, (4,5) is occupied, but food is at (3,6) and (5,5), different.\n\nSo no.\n\nI think the sequence is fixed for the first few turns.\n\nSo for answer:\n\nTurn 74: D\n\nTurn 75: D\n\nTurn 76: R\n\nTurn 77: R\n\nTurn 78: R\n\nAnd for later, but since not required, I can stop at 5 turns.\n\nBut the format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to specify how many, but it doesn't say, so probably a few.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", output for 5 turns.\n\nSo from turn 74 to 78.\n\nActions: D, D, R, R, R\n\nBut at turn 76, I moved R, but turn 76 is t1+2.\n\nt1=74, so:\n\nTurn 74: D\n\nTurn 75: D\n\nTurn 76: R\n\nTurn 77: R\n\nTurn 78: R\n\nYes.\n\nTo be complete, I can add more.\n\nBut I think 5 turns are enough.\n\nIn the state, turn 74, and food life span, but I think it's fine.\n\nSo the actions are determined.\n</think>\nBased on the current state at turn 74, the snake must prioritize survival while attempting to maximize score by eating positive food. However, due to movement constraints and the snake's position, immediate food access is not possible without risking collision. The analysis considers the grid, snake positions, food life spans, and movement rules to plan at least 5 turns ahead.\n\n### Key Observations from Current State (Turn 74):\n- **Snake Position and Direction**: Head at (2,4) moving left (L). The snake body blocks immediate moves left (to (1,4)), up (to (2,5)), and right (reverse move not allowed). Only down to (2,3) is safe and legal.\n- **Food Availability**:\n  - (3,6) with value +1, life span 6: Exists until turn 79 (disappears at turn 80). Cannot be reached by turn 79 due to path constraints.\n  - (5,5) with value +1, life span 9: Exists until turn 82 (disappears at turn 83). Cannot be reached by turn 82 due to distance and the snake's initial trapped position.\n- **Movement Constraints**: No instant reverse (cannot move right from current left direction). Collision risks with body or walls must be avoided.\n- **Long-Term Survival Focus**: With food unreachable in the near term, the priority is to escape the crowded bottom-left area and navigate to open spaces to avoid dead ends. The sequence below ensures survival for at least 5 turns while positioning for potential future opportunities.\n\n### Planned Actions (5 Turns Ahead):\nThe actions are derived from simulating each turn, considering the snake's growing space as it moves away from the body coil. All moves avoid collisions and adhere to movement rules.\n\n- **Turn 74**: Move down (D) to (2,3). This is the only safe move, as other directions are blocked or illegal. No food eaten.\n- **Turn 75**: Move down (D) to (2,2). From (2,3), moving down is the only option (left and right are blocked by body; up is opposite direction and blocked). No food.\n- **Turn 76**: Move right (R) to (3,1). From (2,2), moving down to (2,1) is possible, but then at (2,1), moving left to (1,1) leads to a dead end (trapped with no escape). Moving right to (3,1) avoids this risk and opens a path to the right. No food.\n- **Turn 77**: Move right (R) to (4,1). From (3,1), only right is safe (left is opposite/blocked; up is blocked; down is wall). No food.\n- **Turn 78**: Move right (R) to (5,1). From (4,1), only right is safe (left is opposite/blocked; up is blocked; down is wall). No food.\n\n### Why This Sequence?\n- **Turns 74-75**: The snake is forced down due to body blocks, moving toward the bottom edge but avoiding walls.\n- **Turns 76-78**: Moving right along the bottom row (y=1) is safe and creates distance from the dense body. By turn 78, the snake reaches (5,1), with the tail receding, providing more maneuvering space.\n- **Food Unreachable**: (3,6) and (5,5) cannot be reached within their life spans from the starting position. Attempting to reach them would require risky moves (e.g., early turns have no safe path upward), so survival is prioritized.\n- **Beyond 5 Turns**: After turn 78, the snake can continue right or up toward less crowded areas (e.g., to (6,1) then up). However, as this exceeds the 5-turn requirement, it is not included.\n\nThis plan ensures no collisions or deaths for at least 5 turns. The snake length remains 19 (no food eaten), but the path avoids immediate risks and sets up for future exploration.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 74: D (down)  \nTurn 75: D (down)  \nTurn 76: R (right)  \nTurn 77: R (right)  \nTurn 78: R (right)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 75, and I'm playing Snake on a grid with walls and obstacles. The grid seems to be from (0,0) to (7,7) since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There's also an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: The head is at (2,3), and the direction is down (D). So, moving down means increasing y, I assume? Let me confirm the coordinate system. Typically in such grids, (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? But since moving up is (x,y+1) and down is (x,y-1), that suggests that y increases upwards? No, let's see the definition:\n\nU: (x, y+1) — so if y+1 is up, that means y increases as you go up, so (0,0) is bottom-left? But in the wall description, y=0 and y=7 are borders, so y=0 is probably the bottom row, and y=7 is the top row. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nU (up): (x, y+1) — so from (x,y), moving up increases y, so higher y is up.\n\nD (down): (x, y-1) — decreases y, so lower y is down.\n\nL (left): (x-1, y)\n\nR (right): (x+1, y)\n\nYes.\n\nSnake positions: list is from head to tail. Head: (2,3), then (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1). That's 19 segments, so snake length is 19.\n\nFood: two pieces:\n\n- (3,6) with life_span 5, value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (5,5) with life_span 8, value 1 (positive food)\n\nBoth are positive, no negative food here.\n\nNow, head is at (2,3), direction is down. Since direction is down, last move was down, so from (2,4) to (2,3)? Positions: head is (2,3), previous was (2,4), so yes, it moved down from (2,4) to (2,3). So current direction is down.\n\nI need to choose actions for the next turns, thinking 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: I'll list them to see where the body is.\n\nHead: (2,3)\n\nThen: (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1)\n\nTail is (2,1)\n\nNow, food at (3,6) and (5,5).\n\n(3,6): y=6, which is near the top since y=7 is wall.\n\n(5,5)\n\nLife spans: (3,6) has life 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 75, life_span=5, so it will be there for turns 75,76,77,78,79, and disappear after turn 79? Let's see.\n\n\"Life-span disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo at turn t, with life_span L, it will disappear after turn t + L - 1? Example: if L=1 at turn t, it disappears after turn t, so it's only available on turn t.\n\nGenerally, food is present for turns from current to current + life_span - 1.\n\nFor (3,6): life_span=5 at turn 75, so available from turn 75 to 79 inclusive? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 75, countdown=5, turn 76 countdown=4, ..., turn 79 countdown=1, turn 80 countdown=0, disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 75 to 79. Disappears after turn 79.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) life_span=8, available from turn 75 to 82 (since 75+7=82, countdown from 8 to 1 over 8 turns? Turn 75:8, 76:7, ..., 82:1, 83:0 disappear. So available turns 75 to 82.\n\nNow, head at (2,3), direction down.\n\nPossible moves: I can move U, D, L, R, but cannot move opposite to current direction instantly. Current direction is down, so opposite is up. So I cannot move up immediately, because that would be reverse.\n\nMovement constraints: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n\nCurrent direction is down (since head direction is given as D), so last move was down, so I cannot move up on this next turn (turn 75 action).\n\nSo for turn 75, possible moves: down, left, right. Not up.\n\nDown from (2,3) would be to (2,2)\n\nBut (2,2) is not occupied by snake? Let's see snake positions: (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), etc. (3,2) is there, but (2,2) is not in the list. Positions: I see (1,2), (1,3), etc., but not (2,2). So (2,2) might be free? But let's list all occupied cells.\n\nSnake positions: (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1)\n\nSo (2,2) is not occupied, similarly, (2,0) would be wall since y=0.\n\ny=0 is wall, so (2,2) is within bounds, x=2 between 0-7, y=2 between 0-7, not wall except borders.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), not here.\n\nSo (2,2) is free? But is it accessible?\n\nMoving down to (2,2): y=2, which is fine.\n\nLeft to (1,3): (1,3) is occupied by snake body? Positions: (1,3) is in the list, it's a body segment. (1,3) is part of snake, so moving left to (1,3) would be collision.\n\nRight to (3,3): (3,3) is also in snake positions, body segment.\n\nSo possible moves:\n\n- Down: to (2,2)\n\n- Left: to (1,3) but (1,3) is occupied, so collision\n\n- Right: to (3,3) occupied, collision\n\n- Up: but cannot, because reverse, and also (2,4) is occupied? (2,4) is directly above, which is the second segment, so moving up would go to (2,4), which is part of body, so collision.\n\nBut even if not reverse, it would collide.\n\nSo the only possible move without collision is down to (2,2)? Is (2,2) free?\n\nList of all snake positions: from above, no (2,2). Also, walls: borders, but (2,2) is x=2,y=2, not border, not obstacle. So yes, (2,2) is empty.\n\nBut let me confirm the positions again.\n\nSnake: (2,3) head, then (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1)\n\nSo cells occupied: let's list coordinates:\n\n- Row y=1: (1,1), (2,1)\n\n- Row y=2: (1,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) — (1,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) — missing (2,2)? (2,2) not listed, so free.\n\n- Row y=3: (1,3), (2,3) head, (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) — (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3)\n\n- Row y=4: (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (1,4) — positions: (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), and (1,4)\n\n- Row y=5: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) — (4,5) is there, and (1,5), (2,5), (3,5)\n\ny=5: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)\n\nAnd y=6: no snake, except food at (3,6)\n\ny=7: wall.\n\nSimilarly, x=0 and x=7 walls.\n\nInternal obstacle (4,6).\n\nSo back to head at (2,3). Possible moves:\n\n- Up: (2,4) — but (2,4) is occupied by snake body, so collision. Also, cannot move up because reverse direction? Current direction down, so moving up is opposite, not allowed.\n\n- Down: (2,2) — not occupied, not wall, so possible.\n\n- Left: (1,3) — occupied by snake body (segment), collision.\n\n- Right: (3,3) — occupied by snake body, collision.\n\nTherefore, the only possible move is down to (2,2). No choice.\n\nBut I need to think ahead for multiple turns.\n\nSo for turn 75, action must be D (down).\n\nAfter moving to (2,2), the snake will have new head at (2,2), and the tail will move? When snake moves, head moves to new position, and tail is removed, unless food is eaten.\n\nNo food eaten at (2,2), so tail is removed. Tail is (2,1), so it will be removed, and new positions: head (2,2), then previous head (2,3) becomes second segment, and so on, up to the segment before tail.\n\nCurrent positions: let's index them.\n\nLet S be the list: [ (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1) ]\n\nAfter moving down to (2,2):\n\n- New head: (2,2)\n\n- Then the body: the first segment is (2,3), which was head, now second, then (2,4), (3,4), etc., all the way to (1,2), and tail (1,1) is removed? The last segment is (2,1), but since no food eaten, we remove the tail, so the new tail will be the second last segment, which is (1,2)? Let's see.\n\nAfter move: new positions: head at new position, then all previous segments except the tail is removed.\n\nSo new list: [ (2,2) ] + [ all except last ] of previous? Standard snake movement.\n\nPrevious list has 19 positions. After move without eating, new head at (2,2), and the body is the first 18 positions of the old list, but shifted.\n\nOld list: index 0: head (2,3), 1: (2,4), 2: (3,4), 3: (3,3), 4: (3,2), 5: (4,2), 6: (5,2), 7: (5,3), 8: (4,3), 9: (4,4), 10: (4,5), 11: (3,5), 12: (2,5), 13: (1,5), 14: (1,4), 15: (1,3), 16: (1,2), 17: (1,1), 18: (2,1) tail.\n\nAfter moving to (2,2) without eating:\n\n- New head: (2,2)\n\n- New body: positions 0 to 17 of old list, but position 0 (old head) is now first body segment, position 1 is second, etc., up to position 17 (which is (1,1)) but position 17 is (1,1), and position 18 is tail (2,1) removed.\n\nOld positions 0 to 17: that's 18 segments, but we add new head, so total 19 segments? No.\n\nTypically: new head position, followed by all old segments except the tail is removed.\n\nSo new snake: [ (2,2) ] + [ old[0] to old[17] ] but old[0] to old[17] are 18 positions, plus new head is 19, but we should remove tail, so it should be [ new head ] + [ old head to old second last ].\n\nOld head is index 0, old second last is index 17 ( (1,1) ), and old tail index 18 (2,1) removed.\n\nSo new snake: [ (2,2) ] + [ old[0], old[1], ..., old[17] ]\n\nold[0] is (2,3), old[1] is (2,4), ..., old[17] is (1,1)\n\nBut old[17] is (1,1), which was the 18th segment? List indices: 0 to 18, 19 positions.\n\nIndex 0: head, 1 to 17: body, 18: tail? Or all are segments.\n\nBetter to think: the list has head at index 0, and tail at index -1.\n\nAfter moving to new cell without eating, the new head is at the new position, and the new body is the old head position followed by all old body positions except the last one (tail is removed).\n\nSo new positions: [ new_head ] + old_positions[0:-1]\n\nold_positions[0] is old head, which becomes new body segment 1, etc.\n\nSo here: new_head = (2,2)\n\nold_positions[0:-1] = all except last, so indices 0 to 17: (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1)\n\nold_positions has 19 elements, indices 0 to 18.\n\n[0:-1] means 0 to 17 inclusive, which is 18 elements.\n\nThen new snake: [ (2,2) ] + that list of 18, so 19 segments, but since tail removed, it should be 18 segments? Contradiction.\n\nI think I confused.\n\nStandard: snake has N segments. When it moves without eating, head moves to new cell, tail cell is vacated, so the new snake has the new head, and the old head becomes neck, and so on, down to the old second-last segment becomes new tail. So the new list is: [new_head] + old_body, where old_body is old_positions[0] to old_positions[N-2], but old_positions[0] is old head, which is now the first body segment after new head.\n\nLet old snake be [P0, P1, P2, ..., P_{k-1}] with P0 head, P_{k-1} tail.\n\nAfter move to new cell Q:\n\nIf no food, new snake: [Q, P0, P1, P2, ..., P_{k-2}], so the tail P_{k-1} is removed.\n\nNumber of segments: k segments before, after (k-1) +1? New list has Q and then from P0 to P_{k-2}, that's 1 + (k-1) = k segments? P0 to P_{k-2} is (k-1) elements, plus Q, total k elements, but since tail removed, from k to k, same length? No.\n\nFor example, if snake length L, after move without eating, length remains L, but the tail moves.\n\nInitial: positions A,B,C, length 3.\n\nMove to new head D, no food: new positions D, A, B. C is removed. Length still 3.\n\nIn list: [D, A, B]\n\nHere, old was [P0, P1, P2] with P2 tail.\n\nNew: [Q, P0, P1] , so P2 removed.\n\nIn our case, old positions: let's say P0=(2,3), P1=(2,4), P2=(3,4), P3=(3,3), ..., up to P18=(2,1), 19 positions, so k=19.\n\nAfter move to (2,2) without eating: new snake [ (2,2), P0, P1, P2, ..., P17 ]\n\nP0 to P17: P0 is (2,3), P1 is (2,4), P2 is (3,4), ..., P17 is (1,1) (since old indices: P17 is index 17, which is (1,1), P18 is (2,1) tail removed).\n\nSo new positions: [ (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) ]\n\nNow, new head at (2,2), direction was down to get here, so new direction is down.\n\nTail is now (1,1).\n\nFor turn 75, action is D, to (2,2).\n\nNow, we need to think ahead for multiple turns. The answer should include actions for turn 75, 76, 77, etc., but how many? The format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but it doesn't specify how many turns. Probably for the immediate actions, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I need to plan for at least 5 turns, but the output should be a sequence of actions starting from turn 75.\n\nBut in practice, I need to decide for turn 75, which is forced to D, then for subsequent turns.\n\nFirst, after turn 75, snake is as above.\n\nNow, for turn 76, head at (2,2), direction down.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse, so since last move down, cannot move up.\n\nAlso, check collisions.\n\n- Up: to (2,3) — but (2,3) is now a body segment? New positions: head (2,2), then (2,3) is the second segment, so moving up to (2,3) would collide with body.\n\n- Down: to (2,1) — (2,1) is not in new positions? New positions: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1)\n\nSo (2,1) is not occupied, and y=1, not wall. So (2,1) is free.\n\n- Left: to (1,2) — (1,2) is in positions, it's the second last segment, body, so collision.\n\n- Right: to (3,2) — (3,2) is in positions, body segment, collision.\n\nSo only possible move down to (2,1).\n\nSimilarly, forced.\n\nThen after that, to (2,0), but y=0 is wall, so down to (2,0) would be wall collision, death.\n\nHead at (2,2), down to (2,1): y=1, not wall.\n\nThen from (2,1), possible moves.\n\nBut let's sequence.\n\nTurn 75: action D to (2,2)\n\nThen turn 76: from (2,2), move down to (2,1)\n\nNew positions: after move to (2,1) without eating (no food there).\n\nNew head (2,1), then old head (2,2) becomes body, and so on, up to old second last.\n\nAfter turn 75, positions: [ (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) ]\n\nTail is (1,1)\n\nMove down to (2,1): new head (2,1), but (2,1) was not occupied, but is it free? In the list, (1,1) is tail, (2,1) not in list, so yes.\n\nNew snake: [ (2,1) ] + old[0:-1] = [ (2,1) ] + [ (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) ]  because old[0:-1] is positions from index 0 to 17, which are (2,2) to (1,2), 18 elements.\n\nOld positions 18 elements? After turn 75, we have 19 positions? No.\n\nInitially 19 positions.\n\nAfter turn 75 move to (2,2) without eating, new snake has 19 positions: [ (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) ] 19 positions.\n\nMove to (2,1): new head (2,1), then old positions from 0 to 17: (2,2) to (1,2), since index 0 is (2,2), index 17 is (1,2), and index 18 (1,1) removed.\n\nNew: [ (2,1) ] + [ (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) ]\n\nNow 19 positions, tail is (1,2)\n\nHead at (2,1), direction down.\n\nNow for turn 76, action D to (2,1)\n\nThen turn 77: from (2,1), possible moves.\n\nCurrent direction down, so cannot move up.\n\n- Up: to (2,2) — (2,2) is now a body segment (second position), so collision.\n\n- Down: to (2,0) — but y=0 is wall, so collision, death.\n\n- Left: to (1,1) — (1,1) is not in current positions? Current positions: head (2,1), then (2,2), (2,3), etc., (1,2) is tail, (1,1) not in list, so (1,1) is free? But x=1,y=1, not wall.\n\n- Right: to (3,1) — (3,1) not in positions, free? Check if wall or obstacle.\n\nx=3,y=1, not border, not obstacle, so free.\n\nSo possible moves: left to (1,1) or right to (3,1), down to (2,0) death, up collision.\n\nSo I can move left or right.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead to get food or avoid death.\n\nFood is at (3,6) and (5,5), both positive.\n\n(3,6) has life span 5, so available until turn 79, and (5,5) until turn 82.\n\nCurrent turn after 76 is 77? Let's keep track of turns.\n\nTurn 75: action D to (2,2)\n\nTurn 76: action D to (2,1)  -- I think I have turn 76 action.\n\nAt turn 75, we are deciding action for turn 75.\n\nAfter turn 75 action, it's turn 76, and we need action for turn 76, etc.\n\nBut for turn 76, from (2,2), we moved down to (2,1), so at turn 76, head at (2,1), and we decide action for turn 77.\n\nTurn 77: head at (2,1), can move left to (1,1) or right to (3,1).\n\nNow, let's see the grid.\n\nAlso, the snake is long, 19 segments, so space might be tight.\n\nI need to find a way to get to the food.\n\nFirst, food at (3,6): which is above, near the top.\n\nFrom (2,1), moving left or right.\n\nIf I move left to (1,1), then I'm in the bottom-left corner.\n\nPositions: after moving to (1,1), new head (1,1), then body.\n\nBut (1,1) was tail before? In current positions before move, tail is (1,2), so (1,1) is free.\n\nSimilarly, if move right to (3,1), free.\n\nNow, let's think about accessing (3,6).\n\n(3,6) is at y=6, x=3.\n\nThere is an obstacle at (4,6), so (4,6) is blocked.\n\nAlso, the snake body is around.\n\nCurrent positions after turn 76: head at (2,1)\n\nPositions: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)\n\nSo the area around (3,6): (3,5) is occupied, (4,5) occupied, (2,5) occupied, (3,6) is food, but to eat it, head must move to it when it's free.\n\nBut (3,6) might be under body? Is (3,6) occupied by snake? In positions, no (3,6), so it's free, with food.\n\nFood can be under body only if it spawned there, but here it's not under body, it's free.\n\nSpecial case: food can spawn under body, but here (3,6) is not in snake positions, so it's accessible.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) is free.\n\nTo get to (3,6), from current position (2,1), I need to go up.\n\nBut at (2,1), moving left or right.\n\nIf I move right to (3,1), then from there I can go up to (3,2), but (3,2) is occupied.\n\nAfter moving to (3,1), the positions change.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nOption 1: turn 77 move right to (3,1)\n\nThen new head (3,1), direction right.\n\nNew positions: [ (3,1) ] + old[0:-1] = [ (3,1) ] + [ (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) ] and tail (1,2) removed, so new tail is (1,3)? Old[0:-1] is from (2,1) to (1,3), which is 18 positions, plus new head, 19.\n\nHead at (3,1)\n\nThen for turn 78, possible moves.\n\nCurrent direction right, so cannot move left.\n\n- Left: to (2,1) — (2,1) is now body segment, collision.\n\n- Right: to (4,1) — (4,1) not occupied, not wall, so possible.\n\n- Up: to (3,2) — (3,2) is in positions, body, collision.\n\n- Down: to (3,0) — y=0 wall, death.\n\nSo only possible move right to (4,1)\n\nThen similarly, from (4,1), move right to (5,1), etc., but let's see.\n\n(5,1) might be free.\n\nBut we need to go up to get food.\n\nFrom (4,1), after moving, direction right.\n\nThen to (5,1), then from (5,1), can move up to (5,2), but (5,2) is occupied.\n\nPositions: after moving to (4,1), new head (4,1), etc.\n\nBut this seems to be leading to the bottom-right, but food is up.\n\nPerhaps not efficient.\n\nAlternative: from (2,1) at turn 77, move left to (1,1)\n\nThen new head (1,1), direction left.\n\nNew positions: [ (1,1) ] + old[0:-1] = [ (1,1) ] + [ (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) ] and tail (1,2) removed.\n\nHead at (1,1)\n\nThen turn 78, possible moves.\n\nCurrent direction left, so cannot move right.\n\n- Right: to (2,1) — body, collision\n\n- Left: to (0,1) — x=0 wall, death\n\n- Up: to (1,2) — (1,2) is in positions? New positions: head (1,1), then (2,1), (2,2), etc., (1,2) is not directly, let's see the list: [ (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) ]\n\n(1,2) is not in the list, so (1,2) is free? But in the list, after (2,1) is (2,2), so (1,2) is not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, (1,0) down wall.\n\n- Down: to (1,0) wall death\n\n- Up: to (1,2) — free, not occupied\n\n- But current direction left, so no instant reverse issue for up/down.\n\nMoves: up, down, left, right, but left and right constrained by direction.\n\nCurrent direction is left (since moved left to (1,1)), so cannot move right.\n\n- Up: to (1,2) — free\n\n- Down: to (1,0) wall death\n\n- Left: to (0,1) wall death\n\n- Right: not allowed, reverse\n\nSo only possible move up to (1,2)\n\nThen to (1,3), etc., but (1,3) is occupied.\n\nAfter moving to (1,2), new head (1,2), then body.\n\nBut this is getting messy, and I'm not getting closer to food.\n\nI need to think about the map.\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nGrid 8x8, x 0 to 7, y 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders, and obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions at turn 75 head (2,3) down to (2,2) on turn 75 action.\n\nBut after turn 75, head (2,2), then turn 76 to (2,1), head (2,1).\n\nFrom (2,1), for turn 77, I have to move left or right to avoid death.\n\nBut moving right to (3,1) or left to (1,1).\n\nNow, to reach (3,6), I need to go north.\n\nThe area around (3,6): (3,6) is food, (4,6) obstacle, (3,5) is snake, (4,5) snake, (2,5) snake, (3,7) wall, etc.\n\nAlso, (5,5) food.\n\nThe snake is coiled, so I need to uncoil or find a path.\n\nAnother idea: the tail is moving, so as the snake moves, the tail leaves space.\n\nFor example, after moving down to (2,1), the tail was at (1,2), but after moving, tail is at (1,3) or something.\n\nLet's list the positions after turn 76: head at (2,1), positions: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)\n\nTail at (1,2)\n\nIf I move right to (3,1) on turn 77, then positions: head (3,1), then (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)\n\nTail at (1,3)\n\nThen turn 78, from (3,1), move right to (4,1) as only choice.\n\nNew head (4,1), then (3,1), (2,1), etc.\n\nPositions: [ (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4) ] tail (1,3) removed, so tail at (1,4)\n\nHead at (4,1)\n\nThen turn 79, from (4,1), direction right, so cannot move left.\n\n- Left: to (3,1) body, collision\n\n- Right: to (5,1) — (5,1) not occupied, free\n\n- Up: to (4,2) — (4,2) is body, collision\n\n- Down: to (4,0) wall death\n\nSo only move right to (5,1)\n\nThen to (6,1), etc.\n\nBut this is leading away from food.\n\nFrom (4,1), after moving to (5,1), and so on, I can go up later, but the body is blocking.\n\nFor example, from (5,1), move up to (5,2), but (5,2) is occupied.\n\nPositions: after to (5,1), head (5,1), body includes (5,2), so occupied.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) occupied, etc.\n\nSo it's blocked.\n\nIf from (2,1) at turn 77, I move left to (1,1), then to (1,2) on turn 78, then from (1,2) I can move up to (1,3), but (1,3) is body.\n\nAfter moving to (1,1) on turn 77: positions head (1,1), body (2,1), (2,2), etc.\n\nThen turn 78 move up to (1,2): new head (1,2), then (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) tail removed? Old positions before move: head (1,1), then (2,1), (2,2), ..., (1,3), (1,2) tail? Let's not get lost.\n\nI think I need to focus on the food with short life.\n\nFood at (3,6) life span 5, available until turn 79, so I have to eat it by turn 79.\n\nCurrent turn 75, after actions.\n\nTurn 75: D to (2,2)\n\nTurn 76: D to (2,1)  -- turn 76 action is D, so at turn 76 end, head at (2,1)\n\nTurn 77: I need to choose action.\n\nTo reach (3,6) by turn 79.\n\nFrom (2,1) to (3,6) is 5 steps in Manhattan distance, but with obstacles.\n\n(2,1) to (3,6): Δx=1, Δy=5, so at least 6 moves, but since I can move diagonally? No, only up, down, left, right, so Manhattan distance 6.\n\nFrom (2,1) to (3,6): one right and five up, but not necessarily in that order.\n\nBut I have only 2 moves to get there by turn 79? Turn 77, 78, 79 actions.\n\nAfter turn 77 action, head moves to new position on turn 77.\n\nTurn 77 action: from (2,1), move to some cell.\n\nThen turn 78 action: from there to another.\n\nTurn 79 action: to (3,6) if possible.\n\nBut from (2,1), in two moves, the farthest I can go is Manhattan distance 2, but (3,6) is distance |3-2| + |6-1| =1+5=6, so impossible to reach in 2 moves. Turn 77,78,79: three moves? Turn 77, 78, 79 are three actions.\n\nAfter turn 76, head at (2,1) for turn 77 start.\n\nTurn 77 action: move to new cell, say P1\n\nTurn 78 action: to P2\n\nTurn 79 action: to P3\n\nSo P3 could be (3,6) on turn 79.\n\nFrom (2,1) to (3,6) in three moves: possible sequences, e.g., right, up, up but (3,6) is not reached.\n\n(2,1) to (3,1) in one right, then to (3,2) up, then to (3,3) up, then to (3,4) up, etc., need five up moves to go from y=1 to y=6.\n\nFrom y=1 to y=6, need 5 up moves, so minimum 5 moves to reach (3,6) from (2,1), but I have only 3 moves for turn 77,78,79 to be at (3,6) on turn 79.\n\nTurn 79 action to (3,6).\n\nAfter turn 79 action, head at (3,6) if I eat it.\n\nBut to be at (3,6) on turn 79, I need to move to it on turn 79 action.\n\nFrom current position at turn 77 start: (2,1)\n\nAfter turn 77 action: to a cell, say A\n\nAfter turn 78 action: to B\n\nAfter turn 79 action: to (3,6)\n\nSo from (2,1) to A in one move, A to B in one, B to (3,6) in one.\n\nBut (2,1) to (3,6) requires at least 5 changes, so impossible in 3 moves. For example, the closest I can be to (3,6) in 3 moves from (2,1) is, say, (3,4) if I move right, up, up, but (3,4) is occupied by snake.\n\nOr (4,4), but occupied.\n\nThe free cells near (3,6) are limited.\n\n(3,6) itself is free.\n\nAdjacent cells: (3,5) occupied, (3,7) wall, (2,6) might be free, (4,6) obstacle, so only (2,6) and (3,6), but (3,6) is food, (2,6) might be free.\n\n(2,6): x=2,y=6, not wall, not obstacle, not in snake positions, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) obstacle, (3,5) occupied, etc.\n\nSo to reach (3,6), I need to be at an adjacent cell on turn 78 or something.\n\nBut from (2,1), in three moves, I can reach cells like (2,4) but occupied, or (1,4) occupied, etc. The only free cells near are far.\n\nFor example, moving up from (2,1) is not possible directly because of body.\n\nPerhaps it's impossible to reach (3,6) by turn 79 from current position.\n\nDistance: y from 1 to 6, 5 steps needed, x from 2 to 3, 1 step, but with body in the way, it might take more turns.\n\nBut I have only from turn 77 to 79, 3 turns, to cover 5 steps, impossible.\n\nTurn 77,78,79 are three actions, so I can move three times.\n\nFrom (2,1), after three moves, I can be at a cell with Manhattan distance at most 3.\n\n(3,6) has distance 5, so I cannot reach it by turn 79.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to eat the food at (3,6) before it disappears.\n\nLife span: available until turn 79, so on turn 79, it can be eaten if head moves to it.\n\nBut since I can't reach it by turn 79, it will disappear unused.\n\nSimilarly, the other food at (5,5) has longer life, until turn 82.\n\nSo I should focus on that.\n\nNow, at turn 75, I must move D to (2,2)\n\nTurn 76, move D to (2,1)\n\nThen for turn 77, from (2,1), I can move left to (1,1) or right to (3,1).\n\nNow, to reach (5,5), which is at x=5,y=5.\n\nFrom (2,1), Manhattan distance |5-2| + |5-1| = 3+4=7, so I need to plan a path.\n\nAlso, the snake body will move as I go.\n\nSince the grid has internal obstacle at (4,6), but (5,5) is below.\n\nFirst, let's choose a move for turn 77.\n\nIf I move right to (3,1), then I'm on the right side.\n\nIf I move left to (1,1), on the left side.\n\n(5,5) is on the right, so moving right might be better.\n\nBut let's see the body.\n\nAfter moving to (3,1) on turn 77, head at (3,1), then as before, I have to move right to (4,1) on turn 78, then to (5,1) on turn 79.\n\nFrom (5,1), on turn 80, I can move up to (5,2), but (5,2) is occupied.\n\nPositions after turn 79: let's simulate.\n\nTurn 75: D to (2,2)\n\nTurn 76: D to (2,1)\n\nTurn 77: R to (3,1)\n\nNew positions after turn 77: head (3,1), body: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) and tail (1,2) removed, so no (1,2)\n\nList: new snake: [ (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) ]\n\nTail at (1,3)\n\nTurn 78: from (3,1), move right to (4,1)\n\nNew head (4,1), then old head (3,1) becomes body, and old body except tail removed.\n\nNew positions: [ (4,1) ] + [ (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4) ] and tail (1,3) removed, so new tail (1,4)\n\nHead at (4,1)\n\nTurn 79: from (4,1), move right to (5,1)\n\nNew head (5,1), then (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5) and tail (1,4) removed.\n\nHead at (5,1)\n\nNow, food at (5,5) is still available until turn 82.\n\nFrom (5,1), I want to go to (5,5).\n\nBut (5,2) is occupied, (5,3) occupied.\n\nOn turn 80, from (5,1), possible moves.\n\nCurrent direction right, so cannot move left.\n\n- Left: to (4,1) body, collision\n\n- Right: to (6,1) — x=6, not wall?

(1,3) was removed when tail was removed earlier.\n\nIn this list, no (1,3), so (1,3) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4) is tail.\n\nSo from (1,2), move up to (1,3) possible.\n\n- Left: to (0,2) wall death\n\n- Right: to (2,2) — (2,2) is body, collision\n\n- Down: not allowed\n\nSo only move up to (1,3)\n\nThen to (1,4), but (1,4) is tail, but when I move, tail moves.\n\nAfter moving to (1,3), new head (1,3), then body, and tail removed.\n\nBut (1,4) is current tail, so moving to (1,4) might be possible if it's free after tail moves.\n\nLet's not.\n\nFor (5,5), from here it's far.\n\nI think I need to accept that (3,6) is not reachable in time, and for (5,5), I need a different strategy.\n\nPerhaps I can move in a way that the tail frees up space.\n\nFor example, the tail is moving, so cells become free.\n\nAt turn 75, after D to (2,2), positions include (1,1) tail.\n\nThen turn 76 D to (2,1), tail at (1,2)\n\nThen turn 77, if I move right to (3,1), tail at (1,3) etc.\n\nThe body around (5,5) is at (4,5), (5,3), etc., which will move as the snake moves.\n\nBut it's slow.\n\nAnother idea: the head is at (2,3) turn 75, but I moved down, but was there a way to not move down? But at turn 75, only possible move was down, so no choice.\n\nThen turn 76 only down.\n\nThen turn 77, I have choice left or right.\n\nPerhaps moving right is better because it's closer to (5,5).\n\nFrom (2,1) to (5,5) is dx=3, dy=4.\n\nIf I move right to (3,1), then I can try to go up when possible.\n\nBut from (3,1), I had to move right to (4,1), then to (5,1), then to (6,1), etc.\n\nFrom (5,1), I couldn't go up because (5,2) occupied.\n\nBut after a few turns, when the tail moves, (5,2) might be free.\n\nFor example, at turn 79, head at (5,1), positions include (5,2), (5,3), etc.\n\nThe tail is at (1,4) or something, so (5,2) will be free when the snake moves further.\n\nBut it takes time.\n\nLet's estimate when (5,2) is free.\n\nThe snake length is 19, so the tail is far.\n\nIn positions, (5,2) is at index, but it's fixed position until moved.\n\nAs the snake moves, the cells change.\n\nFor example, after turn 79, head at (5,1), positions: let's list from earlier.\n\nAfter turn 79: head (5,1), body (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5) tail at (1,5)? From turn 79 positions: head (5,1), then (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5) yes, tail (1,5)\n\nSo (5,2) is occupied.\n\nWhen the snake moves right, say to (6,1), then (5,2) becomes the position after, but still occupied.\n\nAfter turn 80: move to (6,1), new head (6,1), then (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5) tail (1,5) removed, so new tail (2,5)? Old positions except tail: from (5,1) to (2,5), 18 positions, plus new head (6,1), 19.\n\nTail at (2,5)\n\n(5,2) is still occupied.\n\nOnly when the tail moves past, but it's slow.\n\nFrom (6,1), move up to (6,2), etc.\n\nBut (5,5) is at (5,5), and (5,4) might be free or not.\n\n(5,4) not in positions, so free.\n\nBut to reach it, I need to go from (6,2) to (6,3), (6,4), then left to (5,4), then up to (5,5), but that takes many turns, and (5,5) life until turn 82, so possible.\n\nTurn 80: from (5,1) to (6,1)\n\nTurn 81: from (6,1) to (6,2) as only choice\n\nTurn 82: from (6,2), can move up to (6,3), or left to (5,2), but (5,2) occupied.\n\nMoves from (6,2): direction up (since moved up to (6,2)? Turn 81 move to (6,2), so direction up.\n\nCannot move down.\n\n- Down: not allowed\n\n- Up: to (6,3) — free, not occupied\n\n- Left: to (5,2) — occupied, collision\n\n- Right: to (7,2) x=7 wall death\n\nSo only move up to (6,3)\n\nThen turn 83: to (6,4), and so on.\n\nBut (5,5) disappears after turn 82, so on turn 82, it can be eaten, but on turn 82, head is at (6,2) or (6,3), not at (5,5).\n\nTurn 82 action: from (6,2) to (6,3), not at (5,5).\n\nSo missed.\n\nIf from (6,2) I could move left, but (5,2) occupied.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nTherefore, with the current path, I can't eat either food.\n\nBut that can't be right; there must be a way.\n\nPerhaps at turn 77, when at (2,1), instead of moving right or left, but I have to.\n\nAnother thought: at turn 75, head at (2,3), direction down, but I moved down to (2,2), but was there a way to not do that? No, because other moves were blocked.\n\nUnless I can eat food or something, but no food there.\n\nPerhaps the food at (3,6) is above, but I can't reach it.\n\nMaybe I can move in a way that the snake uncoils.\n\nFor example, from (2,1), if I move left to (1,1), then up to (1,2), then to (1,3), etc., to the top-left.\n\nBut (1,5) is occupied, so from (1,3) I can move up to (1,4) or something.\n\nLet's try.\n\nTurn 77: from (2,1) move L to (1,1)\n\nHead (1,1), direction left.\n\nTurn 78: move U to (1,2)\n\nHead (1,2), direction up.\n\nTurn 79: from (1,2), move U to (1,3)  -- (1,3) free, as earlier.\n\nNew head (1,3), then body.\n\nPositions after turn 79: head (1,3), body (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5) tail (1,4) removed? Old positions before: head (1,2), body (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), ..., (1,4), tail (1,3) or something.\n\nAfter turn 78: head (1,2), body (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4) tail at (1,4)\n\nMove to (1,3): new head (1,3), then old positions except tail: [ (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5) ] plus new head, 19, tail (1,4) removed.\n\nSo positions: [ (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5) ] tail at (1,5)\n\nNow, from (1,3), I can move up to (1,4) but (1,4) not in positions, free? (1,4) was tail, removed, so free.\n\nMove to (1,4), then to (1,5), but (1,5) is body.\n\nMove to (1,4), then from there to (1,5) if possible.\n\nBut (1,5) is occupied.\n\nMove right to (2,3), but (2,3) occupied.\n\nSo stuck.\n\nI think I need to look for a different initial move or accept that for now, I should survive and look for opportunities.\n\nPerhaps there is a cell that has food under snake body that I can eat later.\n\nFor example, in the initial state, is any food under snake? (3,6) not, (5,5) not.\n\nBut the rule says food can spawn under body, but here it's not.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 75, head at (2,3), direction down, but if I could move up, but I can't because reverse and occupied.\n\nUnless the body moves away, but at this turn, it's occupied.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps for turn 75, action is D, then turn 76 D, then turn 77, I have to choose.\n\nLet's list the free cells near the head.\n\nAt turn 76, head at (2,1), free cells: (1,1), (3,1), and that's it, since (2,0) wall, (2,2) body, etc.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (1,1) or (3,1).\n\nFrom (3,1), free cells: (4,1), (3,2) occupied, etc.\n\nSo the only way is to move to the sides and then up or down, but down is wall.\n\nSo I have to go up eventually.\n\nBut the body is blocking the upper part.\n\nPerhaps as I move, the tail will create space.\n\nFor example, if I move right to (3,1), then to (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), then to (5,5), but (5,5) may be gone or not.\n\nLife span of (5,5) is 8, from turn 75 to 82.\n\nTurn 75: start\nTurn 76: head (2,1)\nTurn 77: to (3,1)\nTurn 78: to (4,1)\nTurn 79: to (5,1)\nTurn 80: to (6,1)\nTurn 81: to (6,2)  -- turn 81 action to (6,2)\nTurn 82: from (6,2) to (6,3) or if possible to (5,2), but occupied.\n\nOn turn 82, (5,5) can be eaten if head moves to it.\n\nBut from (6,2) to (5,5) is not adjacent.\n\nFrom (6,2), I can only go to (6,3), as before.\n\nSo on turn 82, head at (6,2) or (6,3), not at (5,5).\n\nSo cannot eat.\n\nIf from (5,1) on turn 79, I could go up, but can't.\n\nUnless at some point (5,2) is free.\n\nBut in the positions, (5,2) is at index, but when the snake moves, it stays occupied until the tail passes.\n\nFor example, the cell (5,2) is occupied until the segment at (5,2) is removed or moved.\n\nIn the current path, (5,2) is part of the body and not the tail, so it will take many moves to free it.\n\nFor instance, from the positions, the distance from head to that segment is large.\n\nAt turn 79, head at (5,1), (5,2) is the 12th segment or something, so it will be free after 12 moves, which is too late.\n\nSo not practical.\n\nTherefore, I need to move in a different direction from the beginning.\n\nBut at turn 75, no choice.\n\nPerhaps I missed something.\n\nLet's recheck the initial state.\n\nTurn 75, head at (2,3), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: U not allowed and occupied, D to (2,2) free, L to (1,3) occupied, R to (3,3) occupied.\n\nSo only D.\n\nThen to (2,2), then from (2,2), possible moves: U to (2,3) body, D to (2,1) free, L to (1,2) body, R to (3,2) body, so only D to (2,1).\n\nThen from (2,1), U to (2,2) body, D to (2,0) wall, L to (1,1) free, R to (3,1) free.\n\nSo I have to choose L or R.\n\nNow, to maximize long-term survival, I should choose a move that opens up space.\n\nMoving right might be better because the grid has more space on the right or to reach (5,5).\n\nBut with the obstacle at (4,6), it might be tricky.\n\nPerhaps I can move up later.\n\nAnother idea: at (2,1), if I move right to (3,1), then from there, on turn 78, I have to move right to (4,1), but is there a way to move up? No, because (3,2) occupied.\n\nBut if I move left to (1,1), then to (1,2), then to (1,3), then from (1,3), I can move right to (2,3), but (2,3) is occupied.\n\nAt turn 79, after moving to (1,3), positions have (2,3) occupied.\n\nSo not.\n\nI think I have to accept the situation and plan for the future.\n\nPerhaps there is no food to eat immediately, so I should focus on surviving and waiting for new food or something, but the game may spawn new food, but in this state, only these two are given, so I need to eat one of them.\n\nBut (3,6) is too far, (5,5) might be reachable if I can get to it.\n\nLet's calculate the minimum turns to (5,5) from (2,1).\n\nFrom (2,1) to (5,5): dx=3, dy=4, min 7 moves.\n\nWith body, it may take more.\n\nLife span of (5,5) 8 turns from turn 75, so available until turn 82.\n\nFrom turn 77 to turn 82, 6 moves.\n\nTurn 77,78,79,80,81,82: 6 actions.\n\nFrom (2,1), in 6 moves, I can reach (5,5) if path is clear.\n\nFor example, move right three times to (5,1), then up three times to (5,4), then to (5,5) on turn 82.\n\nBut from (2,1) to (3,1) turn 77, (4,1) turn 78, (5,1) turn 79, then from (5,1) to (5,2) but (5,2) occupied, so cannot.\n\nMove right to (3,1), then to (3,2) but occupied, not possible.\n\nMove up when possible.\n\nFor example, from (2,1), move right to (3,1) turn 77.\n\nThen turn 78 to (4,1).\n\nThen turn 79 to (5,1).\n\nThen turn 80 to (6,1).\n\nThen turn 81 to (6,2).\n\nThen turn 82 to (6,3).\n\nNot at (5,5).\n\nFrom (2,1) move left to (1,1) turn 77, then to (1,2) turn 78, then to (1,3) turn 79, then to (1,4) turn 80, then to (1,5) but (1,5) occupied, or to (2,4) but occupied.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo it seems impossible to eat the food with the current position.\n\nBut that can't be; I must have missed a move.\n\nLet's list all cells to see if there's a path.\n\nGrid:\n\nRow y=0: wall\n\ny=1: cells (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (7,1) but walls x=0,7, so (1,1) to (6,1)\n\nAt turn 76, head at (2,1), (1,1) free, (3,1) free, (2,2) body, etc.\n\ny=2: (1,2) body, (2,2) body, (3,2) body, (4,2) body, (5,2) body, (6,2) free, etc.\n\ny=3: (1,3) body, (2,3) body, (3,3) body, (4,3) body, (5,3) body, (6,3) free, etc.\n\ny=4: (1,4) body, (2,4) body, (3,4) body, (4,4) body, (5,4) free?

Snake positions (19 segments): [(2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1)].\n- **Food**: \n  - (3,6) with value +1, life_span 5 (available until turn 79).\n  - (5,5) with value +1, life_span 8 (available until turn 82).\n\n**Key Constraints:**\n- **Immediate Moves (Turn 75)**: Current direction is down (D). Cannot reverse (up) instantly. Possible moves:\n  - Down (D) to (2,2): Free (not wall, obstacle, or snake body).\n  - Left (L) to (1,3): Occupied by snake body (collision).\n  - Right (R) to (3,3): Occupied by snake body (collision).\n  - Up (U): Reverse direction and occupied by body (invalid).\n  - **Only valid move is Down (D) to (2,2)**.\n- **Turn 76**: After moving to (2,2), head at (2,2), direction down. Possible moves:\n  - Down (D) to (2,1): Free.\n  - Other moves (U, L, R) lead to collisions or walls.\n  - **Only valid move is Down (D) to (2,1)**.\n- **Food Accessibility**:\n  - (3,6): Manhattan distance from (2,1) is 5 (|3-2| + |6-1|). Requires 5 moves, but only 3 actions (turns 77-79) available before it disappears after turn 79. Path blocked by body (e.g., (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) occupied). **Unreachable by turn 79**.\n  - (5,5): Manhattan distance from (2,1) is 7 (|5-2| + |5-1|). Available until turn 82 (6 actions: turns 77-82). However, direct path blocked by body (e.g., (5,2), (5,3) occupied). Detour via right moves to (6,1) and up is possible but requires 7+ moves, missing turn 82 deadline. **Unreachable by turn 82**.\n- **Long-Term Survival Priority**: With both foods unreachable, focus shifts to avoiding collisions and maximizing future opportunities. After turn 76, head at (2,1), only moves are left (L) to (1,1) or right (R) to (3,1). Moving right (R) is preferred as it:\n  - Avoids the left wall and tight corners.\n  - Provides more open space on the right for future maneuvering.\n  - Aligns better with potential new food spawns.\n\n**5+ Turn Plan (Prioritizing Survival):**\n1. **Turn 75 (Forced)**: Move down (D) to (2,2) – only safe option.\n2. **Turn 76 (Forced)**: Move down (D) to (2,1) – only safe option.\n3. **Turn 77 (Choice)**: Move right (R) to (3,1) – opens right-side space.\n4. **Turn 78 (Forced after R)**: From (3,1), direction right, so cannot reverse left. Only safe move is right (R) to (4,1).\n5. **Turn 79 (Forced after R)**: From (4,1), direction right, so cannot reverse left. Only safe move is right (R) to (5,1).\n6. **Beyond Turn 79**: Continue right to (6,1) on turn 80, then up to (6,2) on turn 81, etc., to stay alive in open areas.\n\n**Output Sequence (Turns 75-79):**\n- Turn 75: D (down)\n- Turn 76: D (down)\n- Turn 77: R (right)\n- Turn 78: R (right)\n- Turn 79: R (right)\n\nThis sequence ensures survival for at least 5 turns, avoids all immediate risks, and positions the snake in a less constrained area for future food opportunities.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 75: D \\\\\nTurn 76: D \\\\\nTurn 77: R \\\\\nTurn 78: R \\\\\nTurn 79: R\n}",

So the head is at (2,2), and the tail is at (1,1).\n\nFood:\n\n- (3,6) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (5,5) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (2,5) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food here. Life span decreases each turn, including this one, so for (3,6), after this turn, life span becomes 3, then 2, etc.\n\nSnake head direction is down, so from (2,2), moving down would go to (2,1), but let's check if that's possible.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid. Walls at borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nAvailable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except where snake or obstacles are.\n\nBut (4,6) is an obstacle, so that cell is blocked.\n\nFood at (3,6), (5,5), (2,5).\n\n(3,6): x=3, y=6. y=6 is not a border wall? Borders are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is inside, but walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is fine. Similarly, x=3, x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=3 is fine.\n\nBut (4,6) is an internal obstacle, so cell (4,6) is blocked.\n\n(3,6) is not (4,6), so it should be accessible, but y=6 is row 6, and since walls are at y=7, y=6 is not a wall cell. Similarly, (5,5) and (2,5) are both within bounds.\n\nNow, snake head at (2,2), direction down. Possible moves: since direction is down, I can't move up instantly (opposite), so possible moves are down, left, or right? Directions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).\n\nHead at (2,2), moving down (D) means to (x, y-1), so (2,1).\n\nBut y=1, and walls are at y=0, so y=1 is not a wall; it's inside.\n\nCurrent direction is D, so I cannot move up (U) next because that's opposite. So possible moves from (2,2) with current dir D: down (D) to (2,1), left (L) to (1,2), or right (R) to (3,2). Cannot move up to (2,3) because that's opposite direction.\n\nNow, I need to check if these moves are safe.\n\nFirst, move down to (2,1): what is at (2,1)? Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n\nSnake: [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1)]\n\nSo cells occupied: (2,2) head, (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) tail.\n\n(2,1) is not in this list, so it's empty? But is it within bounds? x=2, y=1, walls at y=0, so y=1 is valid. No obstacle mentioned except (4,6), so (2,1) should be free.\n\nBut let's confirm: walls are borders x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7 and internal (4,6). So (2,1) is x=2,y=1, not wall, not occupied, so safe to move? Not necessarily, because after moving, the snake body might be there, but when moving, the head moves to new position, and the tail moves away, so only if the new head position is not occupied by body except the tail.\n\nCollision: head touches any body segment except that if it's the tail, and tail moves, it might be ok, but generally, moving to tail position is safe because tail moves.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by the tail, it's ok, because after the move, the tail moves away and head is there without collision.\n\nSimilarly, if it moves to a body segment, it collides.\n\nNow, in this case, (2,1): is it occupied? From the list, (1,1) is tail, but (2,1) is not in the positions. Positions are (2,2), (2,3), etc., no (2,1), so (2,1) is empty. So moving down to (2,1) should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, move left to (1,2): what is at (1,2)? Snake has (1,2) in the list. Let's see: positions include (1,2), which is not the tail; tail is (1,1). (1,2) is a body segment. Snake positions: ... (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1). So (1,2) is the 18th segment or something, not tail. So if head moves to (1,2), it would collide with body.\n\nSimilarly, move right to (3,2): what is at (3,2)? Snake has (3,2) in positions. Positions: (3,2) is listed, and it's not tail; tail is (1,1). (3,2) is a body segment. So moving to (3,2) would cause collision.\n\nTherefore, from current position (2,2), with dir D, possible moves:\n\n- Down (D) to (2,1): empty, safe\n\n- Left (L) to (1,2): occupied by body, collision, not safe\n\n- Right (R) to (3,2): occupied by body, collision, not safe\n\n- Up (U) to (2,3): but cannot, because opposite direction, current dir is D, so U is invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is down to (2,1)? But that seems too limited. Let me double-check the snake positions.\n\nSnake positions: let's list all coordinates:\n\nHead: (2,2)\n\nThen (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1)\n\nNow, (2,1) is not in this list, so free.\n\n(1,2) is in list, occupied.\n\n(3,2) is in list, occupied.\n\n(2,3) is in list, but cannot move up anyway.\n\nSo indeed, only down to (2,1) is possible without collision or wall.\n\nBut (2,1) is within bounds: x=2 between 1-6, y=1 between 1-6? y=1, walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is row 1, which is inside since y=0 is wall.\n\nGrid: I assume x and y from 0 to 7, with walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, I think. Let's confirm.\n\nState says: \"Cells occupied by walls: - Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" So yes, all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Internal obstacle (4,6).\n\nSo for (2,1): x=2, y=1, y=1 is not 0, so not wall, and not (4,6), so free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) not occupied, so moving down should be safe.\n\nBut is there food at (2,1)? Food is at (3,6), (5,5), (2,5), no (2,1), so no food, just move.\n\nNow, after moving, the snake will have new head at (2,1), and the tail will move from (1,1) to... when head moves to (2,1), the body follows, so the new positions: head at (2,1), then previous head (2,2) becomes body, and so on, up to the tail (1,1) which is removed since no food eaten. Since no food, length same, tail moves away.\n\nNew positions: head (2,1), then (2,2), (2,3), ..., down to tail (1,2) or something? Let's see: original positions, after moving down, head to (2,1), then the segment that was at (2,2) is now at (2,2) but it's the second segment, and so on. The tail was at (1,1), since no food, it moves off, so the new tail is the one that was before tail, which is (1,2).\n\nOriginal positions: index 0: (2,2) head, 1: (2,3), 2: (2,4), 3: (3,4), 4: (3,3), 5: (3,2), 6: (4,2), 7: (5,2), 8: (5,3), 9: (4,3), 10: (4,4), 11: (4,5), 12: (3,5), 13: (2,5), 14: (1,5), 15: (1,4), 16: (1,3), 17: (1,2), 18: (1,1) tail.\n\nAfter move down, head to (2,1), so new head (2,1). Then the body: the segment that was at position 0 (old head) is now at (2,2)? No: the head moves to new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo: new position 0: (2,1)  // new head\n\nNew position 1: old position 0, which is (2,2)\n\nNew position 2: old position 1, (2,3)\n\nNew position 3: old position 2, (2,4)\n\nNew position 4: old position 3, (3,4)\n\nNew position 5: old position 4, (3,3)\n\nNew position 6: old position 5, (3,2)\n\nNew position 7: old position 6, (4,2)\n\nNew position 8: old position 7, (5,2)\n\nNew position 9: old position 8, (5,3)\n\nNew position 10: old position 9, (4,3)\n\nNew position 11: old position 10, (4,4)\n\nNew position 12: old position 11, (4,5)\n\nNew position 13: old position 12, (3,5)\n\nNew position 14: old position 13, (2,5)\n\nNew position 15: old position 14, (1,5)\n\nNew position 16: old position 15, (1,4)\n\nNew position 17: old position 16, (1,3)\n\nNew position 18: old position 17, (1,2)  // new tail, since tail was removed.\n\nOld tail (1,1) is gone, so new snake is 19 segments? No, since no food eaten, length same, so from 19 segments, after move, head new, tail removed, so 18 segments? Let's count.\n\nOriginal positions: 19 cells? List: from (2,2) to (1,1), that's 19 positions? Let's index: 0 to 18, 19 positions. Yes.\n\nAfter move without eating, snake moves, so head to new cell, tail cell is vacated, so new snake has same length, positions from new head to new tail.\n\nNew head: (2,1)\n\nThen the first body segment is the old head position (2,2)\n\nThen (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)  // and old tail (1,1) is gone, so new tail is (1,2)\n\nSo new positions: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)\n\nNow, head direction is now down, since moved down.\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nIn this state, I have to output actions for turn 76, 77, 78, etc., but the state is for turn 76, and I need to decide action for turn 76, then for turn 77 based on that, and so on.\n\nThe answer format is to output a sequence of actions starting from turn 76.\n\nBut since the future depends on food and such, I need to simulate.\n\nAlso, food life span decreases each turn.\n\nCurrent turn 76, food:\n\n- (3,6) life span 4, so after turn 76, it becomes 3, then 2, etc., disappears when life span 0.\n\n- (5,5) life span 7\n\n- (2,5) life span 10\n\nAll value 1.\n\nNow, back to turn 76 action: only possible move is down to (2,1), so for turn 76, I must move down.\n\nThen for turn 77, head at (2,1), direction down.\n\nFrom (2,1), possible moves: down to (2,0), but y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n\nLeft to (1,1): what is at (1,1)? Now, after move, positions: head (2,1), then (2,2), (2,3), ..., (1,2) tail.\n\n(1,1) is not occupied, since tail is at (1,2), and (1,1) is free? But (1,1) is within bounds? x=1,y=1, not wall, not occupied, so left to (1,1) possible.\n\nRight to (3,1): (3,1) not occupied, should be free.\n\nUp to (2,2): but (2,2) is occupied by body, and it's not tail, so collision. Also, current direction down, so up is opposite, invalid anyway.\n\nSo from (2,1) dir down, possible moves:\n\n- Down: to (2,0) but y=0 wall, invalid\n\n- Left: to (1,1), empty, safe\n\n- Right: to (3,1), empty, safe\n\n- Up: invalid, opposite direction\n\nSo for turn 77, I can move left or right.\n\nNow, I need to think about food and long-term.\n\nFood is at (3,6), (5,5), (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is currently occupied by the snake? In the positions, (2,5) is there, index 13 or something, but it's a body segment, so food at (2,5) is under the body, but to eat it, the body must move away and head move there.\n\nSimilarly, other food.\n\nLife span: (2,5) has life 10, so many turns, (3,6) life 4, so only 4 turns including this, so it will disappear soon.\n\n(5,5) life 7.\n\nNow, since I have to move to (2,1) for turn 76, then for turn 77, I can go left to (1,1) or right to (3,1).\n\nI need to plan a path to food while avoiding dead ends.\n\nAlso, the grid has an obstacle at (4,6), which might block access.\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nGrid rows y=1 to 6, columns x=1 to 6, but walls at borders, so cells (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except internal obstacle (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is at x=4,y=6.\n\nNow, snake after turn 76: head at (2,1), body down to (1,2) tail.\n\nPositions: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)\n\nSo the snake is mostly on the left and bottom, with a loop or something.\n\nFrom (2,1) head, to (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), then to (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), then to (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) tail.\n\nSo it's like the head is at bottom left, and the body goes up to (2,4), right to (3,4), down to (3,2), right to (5,2), up to (5,3), left to (4,3), up to (4,4), up to (4,5), left to (3,5), left to (2,5), down to (1,5), left to (1,4), down to (1,3), down to (1,2).\n\nNow, for turn 77, from (2,1), I can go left to (1,1) or right to (3,1).\n\n(1,1) is free, (3,1) is free.\n\nIf I go left to (1,1), then new head (1,1), direction left (since moved left).\n\nThen body: new positions: head (1,1), then (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)  // tail (1,2) removed, new tail (1,3)\n\nThen from (1,1), dir L, possible moves: down to (1,0) wall invalid, left to (0,1) x=0 wall invalid, right to (2,1) which is occupied by body (second segment), collision, up to (1,2) but (1,2) is now the position before tail or something? New positions: (1,1) head, (2,1), (2,2), ..., (1,3) tail.\n\n(1,2) is not a position now; after move, positions are (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)\n\nSo (1,2) is not occupied; it's empty. But from (1,1), moving up to (1,2): (1,2) is empty, so possible. Current direction left, so moving up is not opposite, so allowed.\n\nMoves from (1,1) dir L:\n\n- Down: (1,0) wall, invalid\n\n- Left: (0,1) wall, invalid\n\n- Right: (2,1) occupied by body (it's the second segment), so collision\n\n- Up: (1,2) empty, safe\n\nSo only up to (1,2) is possible.\n\nThen from there, it might be tight.\n\nIf at turn 77, I go right to (3,1) from (2,1).\n\nFrom (2,1) dir down, move right to (3,1), so new head (3,1), direction right.\n\nNew positions: head (3,1), then (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)  // tail (1,2) removed, new tail (1,3)? Original after turn 76 tail is (1,2), so after move, new tail is (1,3).\n\nPositions: new head (3,1), then old head (2,1), then (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)\n\n(1,2) is gone, so tail is (1,3).\n\nFrom (3,1) dir R, possible moves: down to (3,0) wall invalid, up to (3,2) which is occupied by body, collision, left to (2,1) occupied by body (second segment), collision, right to (4,1) which should be free.\n\n(4,1) not occupied, not wall, so safe.\n\nSo only right to (4,1) possible.\n\nThen from (4,1), I can go up or right, etc.\n\nBut I need to get to food.\n\nFood at (3,6), (5,5), (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is currently occupied, so I need to move the body away and head there.\n\n(3,6) has short life, only 4 turns at turn 76, so after turn 76, life span 3, then 2, then 1, then 0, so it disappears after turn 79 or something.\n\nAt turn 76, life span 4, meaning it will be there for 4 more turns, including turn 76. So on turn 76, if head is there, can eat, but not. After turn 76, life span decreases to 3, so available on turn 77,78,79? Let's clarify life span.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for food at (3,6) with life span 4 at turn 76, it means on turn 76, it is present, and after each turn, life span decreases, so after turn 76, life span 3, after turn 77, life span 2, after turn 78, life span 1, after turn 79, life span 0, so it disappears at the beginning of turn 80 or after turn 79? Typically, it is available until life span 0, but when life span reaches 0, it disappears.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 76, life span 4, it can be eaten on turn 76.\n\nAfter turn 76, before turn 77, life span decreases to 3.\n\nOn turn 77, life span 3, can be eaten, and so on.\n\nOn turn when life span 1, it can be eaten, then after that, life span 0, disappears.\n\nSo for (3,6), available on turns 76,77,78,79. On turn 79, if eaten, life span 1, eaten, then gone. If not eaten on turn 79, on turn 80 it is gone.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) life 7, available turns 76 to 82.\n\n(2,5) life 10, available turns 76 to 85.\n\nNow, snake is at (2,1) after turn 76 move, which we have to do.\n\nTo reach (3,6) from (2,1), it's at (3,6), which is x=3,y=6.\n\n(2,1) to (3,6) is distance |3-2| + |6-1| = 1+5=6 moves, but not straight, and with obstacles.\n\nBut life span only 3 more turns after 76? At turn 77, head at (2,1), to (3,6) is |dx|=1, |dy|=5, so min 5 moves if I go up directly, but from (2,1), I can go up to (2,2), but (2,2) is occupied by body.\n\nAfter turn 76, head at (2,1), positions: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), etc.\n\n(2,2) is the second segment, so I cannot move up to (2,2) from (2,1) because it's occupied.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) might be free, but to go up, I need to go to areas with space.\n\nFrom (2,1), for turn 77, if I go left to (1,1), then from there only up to (1,2), then from (1,2) I can go up to (1,3), but (1,3) is body, occupied.\n\nAfter moving to (1,1) on turn 77, positions: head (1,1), then (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) tail.\n\n(1,3) is tail, so from (1,1), I can move up to (1,2), which is empty? (1,2) is not in positions, so free.\n\nThen on turn 78, head to (1,2), new head (1,2), then body (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), etc., new tail (1,4) or something.\n\nThen from (1,2), I can move up to (1,3), but (1,3) is occupied by body, and it's not tail, so collision. Or down to (1,1) but occupied, or left to (0,1) wall, or right to (2,2) occupied. So stuck, only possible move from (1,2) might be up, but if (1,3) is body, not safe.\n\nAfter head at (1,2), positions: new head (1,2), then (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4)  // and (1,3) was tail, removed? Let's trace.\n\nAfter turn 77 move to (1,1): positions as above.\n\nThen turn 78 move up to (1,2): new head (1,2), then old head (1,1), then (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4)  // old tail (1,3) removed, so new tail (1,4)\n\nNow, from (1,2) head, possible moves: up to (1,3): but (1,3) is not in positions, free? Positions have (1,4) and (1,5), but not (1,3). (1,3) was removed, so free.\n\nDown to (1,1): occupied by body (second segment), collision.\n\nLeft to (0,2) x=0 wall invalid.\n\nRight to (2,2): occupied by body, collision.\n\nSo only up to (1,3) is possible and safe, since (1,3) is free.\n\nMove to (1,3), then new head (1,3), etc.\n\nBut this is going to the left, away from food.\n\nFood is at (3,6) and (5,5), which are top-right.\n\n(2,5) is also occupied now.\n\nSo going left to (1,1) might lead to a dead end or limited space.\n\nIf at turn 77 from (2,1) I go right to (3,1).\n\nThen head at (3,1), dir R.\n\nPositions: head (3,1), then (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) tail.\n\nFrom (3,1), only possible move right to (4,1), as earlier.\n\nMove to (4,1), new head (4,1), dir R.\n\nThen from (4,1), possible moves: down to (4,0) wall invalid, up to (4,2) which is occupied by body, collision, left to (3,1) occupied, collision, right to (5,1) which should be free.\n\n(5,1) not occupied, not wall, so move right to (5,1).\n\nThen head at (5,1), dir R.\n\nThen from (5,1), possible moves: down to (5,0) wall invalid, up to (5,2) which is occupied by body, collision, left to (4,1) occupied, collision, right to (6,1).\n\n(6,1) is within bounds? x=6, y=1, walls at x=7, so x=6 is not wall, y=1 not wall, so (6,1) free, so move right to (6,1).\n\nThen head at (6,1), dir R.\n\nFrom (6,1), possible moves: down to (6,0) wall invalid, up to (6,2), which should be free, left to (5,1) occupied, collision, right to (7,1) x=7 wall invalid.\n\nSo only up to (6,2).\n\nMove to (6,2), new head (6,2), dir U.\n\nThen from (6,2), I can go up to (6,3), or left to (5,2), etc.\n\n(5,2) is occupied? Positions after previous moves.\n\nLet's simulate the positions.\n\nStart from after turn 76: head (2,1), positions: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) tail.\n\nTurn 77: move right to (3,1), new head (3,1), then (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)  // tail (1,2) removed, new tail (1,3)\n\nTurn 78: move right to (4,1), new head (4,1), then (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4)  // tail (1,3) removed, new tail (1,4)\n\nTurn 79: move right to (5,1), new head (5,1), then (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5)  // tail (1,4) removed, new tail (1,5)\n\n(5,1) to (5,2): (5,2) is occupied, but in positions, (5,2) is still there, index 10 or something.\n\nPositions: head (5,1), then (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5) tail.\n\n(5,2) is position 11, occupied.\n\nSo from (5,1), move up to (5,2) is occupied, collision.\n\nMove right to (6,1) as I said.\n\nTurn 79 move to (6,1): new head (6,1), then (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5)  // tail (1,5) removed? New tail is (1,5) but it's the last, after move, new tail is the one before, which is (2,5) or something.\n\nOld positions before move: head (5,1), body (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5) tail.\n\nAfter move to (6,1): new head (6,1), then old head (5,1), then (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)  // tail (1,5) removed, new tail (2,5)\n\nSo positions: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nNow head at (6,1), dir R (since moved right).\n\nMove up to (6,2): (6,2) should be free, not occupied, not wall.\n\nMove to (6,2), new head (6,2), dir U.\n\nThen from (6,2), I can go up to (6,3), left to (5,2), etc.\n\n(6,3) might be free, (5,2) is occupied.\n\nPositions: after move, head (6,2), then (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)  // tail (2,5) removed, new tail (3,5)? Old tail was (2,5), removed, new tail is the one before, which is (3,5).\n\nPositions: new head (6,2), then (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5) tail.\n\nFrom (6,2), possible moves: up to (6,3), down to (6,1) occupied, left to (5,2) occupied, right to (7,2) x=7 wall invalid.\n\nSo only up to (6,3).\n\nMove to (6,3), and so on.\n\nThis is taking me to the bottom-right, but food is at (3,6) and (5,5), which are top, so I need to go up.\n\nBut (3,6) has short life, at turn 76 life 4, so on turn 77 life 3, turn 78 life 2, turn 79 life 1, turn 80 gone.\n\nFrom current position after turn 76, at (2,1), to (3,6) is far, and with the body, it's hard to reach in time.\n\nFor example, from (2,1), if I could go up, but I can't because (2,2) is occupied.\n\nThe only way is to go right or left and then find a path up.\n\nBut with the snake body, it might be blocked.\n\nPerhaps I should aim for (5,5) or (2,5) later.\n\n(2,5) is currently occupied, but when the snake moves, it might free up.\n\nFor example, if the tail moves, (2,5) could be free.\n\nIn the current positions, (2,5) is occupied, but as the snake moves, it will be vacated at some point.\n\nBut to eat it, the head needs to move there after it's free.\n\nBut with life span 10, it's ok.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) is free now? (5,5) is food position, is it occupied by snake?\n\nSnake positions: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), etc., no (5,5), so (5,5) is free, food there.\n\n(3,6) is also free, but (4,6) is obstacle, so (3,6) is adjacent.\n\nBack to turn 76 action: I have to move down to (2,1).\n\nThen for turn 77, I need to choose between left or right.\n\nIf I go right, I can get to the right side, which has more space, and (5,5) is there.\n\nIf I go left, I might get stuck.\n\nSo better to go right.\n\nSo for turn 77, move right to (3,1).\n\nThen as above, I can move to (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), etc.\n\nFrom (6,3), I can go left to (5,3), but (5,3) is occupied.\n\nAfter some moves, positions change.\n\nLet's think about eating food.\n\nFood at (5,5): from current, after moving right, I can go up.\n\nFor example, from (6,2), I moved to (6,3), then from (6,3), I can go up to (6,4), then (6,5), then left to (5,5), but (5,5) is food.\n\nBut need to see if it's available.\n\nLife span 7, so plenty of time.\n\nAlso, (2,5) can be eaten later.\n\nBut there's a risk with (2,5) because of tail reward danger.\n\nRule: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nSo if tail has food on it, and head is adjacent, eating it causes collision.\n\nIn this case, for (2,5), it is currently under the body, not tail, so if it becomes free, and head moves there, it's ok, as long as not adjacent to tail when eating.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on the sequence.\n\nFirst, for turn 76, I must move down to (2,1).\n\nThen for turn 77, I should move right to (3,1) to go towards the right side.\n\nThen turn 78: move right to (4,1)\n\nTurn 79: move right to (5,1)\n\nTurn 80: move right to (6,1)\n\nThen from (6,1), move up to (6,2) on turn 81\n\nThen turn 82: move up to (6,3)\n\nThen turn 83: move up to (6,4)\n\nThen turn 84: move up to (6,5)\n\nThen from (6,5), I can move left to (5,5) to eat the food.\n\n(5,5) is at (5,5), so from (6,5) move left to (5,5).\n\nNow, is (5,5) free? Yes, and food there.\n\nLife span: at turn 76, life 7, so on turn 84, how many turns? From turn 76 to 84 is 8 turns, but life decreases each turn.\n\nTurn 76: life 7\n\nAfter turn 76, life 6\n\nTurn 77: life 6\n\nAfter turn 77, life 5\n\n...\n\nAfter turn k, life decreases.\n\nAt the start of turn t, the life span is the value before the turn.\n\nFor food at turn 76, life span 4, it can be eaten on turn 76,77,78,79.\n\nSimilarly for (5,5) life 7 at turn 76, can be eaten on turn 76 to turn 82? Let's calculate.\n\nAt turn 76: life span 7, available\n\nAfter turn 76: life span 6\n\nTurn 77: life span 6, available\n\nAfter turn 77: life span 5\n\nTurn 78: life span 5, available\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 82: life span 1, available on turn 83? No.\n\nAt turn t, before action, food has life span L.\n\nIf eaten, ok.\n\nAfter turn, life span decreases by 1.\n\nSo for (5,5), life span 7 at turn 76.\n\nOn turn 76: L=7, can be eaten\n\nAfter turn 76: L=6\n\nTurn 77: L=6, can be eaten\n\nAfter turn 77: L=5\n\n...\n\nTurn 82: L=1, can be eaten\n\nAfter turn 82: L=0, disappears, not available on turn 83.\n\nSimilarly, last available on turn 82.\n\nNow in my plan, at turn 84, I want to eat (5,5), but turn 84 is too late; on turn 82, L=1, can be eaten on turn 82, but on turn 83 L=0 gone.\n\nTurn 82: L=1, available.\n\nTurn 83: not available.\n\nIn my sequence, on turn 84, it's gone.\n\nMistake.\n\nFrom after turn 76, head at (2,1)\n\nI need to reach (5,5) faster.\n\n(5,5) is at x=5,y=5, head at (2,1) after turn 76.\n\n|dx|=3, |dy|=4, so min 7 moves if not direct.\n\nBut with body, it might be longer.\n\nAfter turn 77: at (3,1) if move right\n\nTurn 78: at (4,1)\n\nTurn 79: at (5,1)\n\nFrom (5,1), I can move up to (5,2), but (5,2) is occupied.\n\nIn positions, at turn 79, when head at (5,1), positions include (5,2), so occupied.\n\nI cannot move up directly.\n\nOnly move right to (6,1) as before.\n\nThen from (6,1) to (6,2), etc.\n\nFrom (5,1), I can only go to (6,1), then (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), then to (5,5).\n\nFrom (5,1) to (6,1) turn 80, (6,2) turn 81, (6,3) turn 82, (6,4) turn 83, (6,5) turn 84, then (5,5) turn 85, but (5,5) gone by turn 83 or 84?\n\nTurn 76: L=7\n\nTurn 77: L=6\n\nTurn 78: L=5\n\nTurn 79: L=4\n\nTurn 80: L=3\n\nTurn 81: L=2\n\nTurn 82: L=1\n\nTurn 83: L=0, gone, not available.\n\nSo on turn 82, L=1, can be eaten if head there.\n\nBut on turn 82, in my sequence, head at (6,3) or something.\n\nLet's list turns:\n\nTurn 76: move D to (2,1)\n\nTurn 77: move R to (3,1)\n\nTurn 78: move R to (4,1)\n\nTurn 79: move R to (5,1)\n\nTurn 80: move R to (6,1)\n\nTurn 81: move U to (6,2)\n\nTurn 82: move U to (6,3)  // on turn 82, head at (6,3), (5,5) is at L=1, but (6,3) to (5,5) is not adjacent, I need to go to (6,4) or (5,4), but not directly to (5,5).\n\nFrom (6,3), I can move left to (5,3), but (5,3) is occupied by body.\n\nPositions at turn 82:\n\nAfter turn 81: head at (6,2), positions: let's not simulate, but (5,3) is likely occupied.\n\nTo reach (5,5) by turn 82, I need a different path.\n\nFrom (2,1), instead of going right all the way, maybe go up when possible.\n\nBut from (2,1), I can only go left or right, not up.\n\nAfter moving to (3,1) on turn 77, from (3,1) I can only go to (4,1).\n\nFrom (4,1) on turn 78, from (4,1), I can go up if possible, but (4,2) is occupied, so only to (5,1) or right.\n\nSimilarly, no up.\n\nSo I cannot reach (5,5) in time for turn 82; it's too far.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) is even farther and shorter life.\n\nSo perhaps I should forget about (3,6) and (5,5) for now and focus on (2,5), which has long life.\n\n(2,5) is at (2,5), and it's currently occupied, but as the snake moves, it will be vacated.\n\nFor example, the tail is at (1,2) after turn 76.\n\nAs I move, the tail moves.\n\nIn the sequence going right, the tail is moving.\n\nAfter turn 76, tail at (1,2)\n\nAfter turn 77 move R to (3,1), tail at (1,3)\n\nAfter turn 78 move R to (4,1), tail at (1,4)\n\nAfter turn 79 move R to (5,1), tail at (1,5)\n\nAfter turn 80 move R to (6,1), tail at (2,5)? Earlier simulation.\n\nAfter turn 80: head at (6,1), positions: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) tail.\n\nTail at (2,5)\n\n(2,5) has food, but it's under the tail.\n\nIf I move the head to (2,5), but it's the tail, and I can move to tail position, but there is food on it.\n\nRule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nSo for food under body, it can be eaten only when the body moves away and head moves there.\n\nIn this case, (2,5) has food and is currently occupied by the tail at some point.\n\nAt turn 80, (2,5) is tail, with food on it.\n\nIf the tail moves away, then the cell is free with food, and head can move there to eat.\n\nBut there is tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it kills.\n\nBut here, when tail moves away, the food is there, head can move to it.\n\nBut at turn 80, (2,5) is tail, so if I move the tail away, then (2,5) is free with food.\n\nThen head can move there.\n\nBut head is at (6,1), far away.\n\nTo eat (2,5), I need to have the head near when it's free.\n\nCurrently, at turn 76, (2,5) is occupied by body, not tail.\n\nTail is at (1,2).\n\nAs the snake moves, the tail will move to (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), then (2,5), etc.\n\nLet's see when (2,5) is vacated.\n\nAt turn 76, positions include (2,5) as a body segment.\n\nAfter each move, the tail moves, so the cell that was tail is vacated.\n\nBut (2,5) is not tail yet.\n\nIn the positions, (2,5) is index 13 or something.\n\nWhen the tail moves to the next position, the previous tail cell is vacated.\n\nBut (2,5) will be the tail when the snake has moved enough.\n\nFor example, in the going-right sequence, at turn 80, tail is at (2,5), so (2,5) is occupied by tail.\n\nThen on turn 81, if I move, tail moves to (3,5) or something, so (2,5) is vacated.\n\nAt turn 80, head at (6,1), tail at (2,5)\n\nAfter turn 81, if I move head to (6,2), then tail moves from (2,5) to the next, which is (3,5)? Positions: at turn 80, positions: head (6,1), body (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) tail.\n\nAfter move up to (6,2): new head (6,2), then (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)  // tail (2,5) removed, new tail (3,5)\n\nSo (2,5) is vacated, and food is there, so it can be eaten if head moves there.\n\nBut head is at (6,2), far from (2,5).\n\nTo eat it, I need to move head to (2,5) when it's free.\n\nSince life span 10, it will be available for many turns, so I can plan to go back.\n\nBut the snake is long, 19 segments, so it takes time to turn around.\n\nPerhaps at the beginning, from turn 76, instead of going right, I should go left, but going left might lead to dead end.\n\nAnother idea: from (2,1), move left to (1,1) on turn 77, then up to (1,2) on turn 78, then up to (1,3) on turn 79, then from (1,3), I can go right to (2,3) or up to (1,4), but (1,4) is body, etc.\n\nAfter turn 76: head (2,1)\n\nTurn 77: move L to (1,1)\n\nPositions: head (1,1), then (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) tail\n\nTurn 78: move U to (1,2)  // as earlier, only possible\n\nNew head (1,2), then (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4) tail\n\nTurn 79: move U to (1,3)  // (1,3) free, move up\n\nNew head (1,3), then (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5) tail\n\nFrom (1,3), possible moves: up to (1,4) occupied, down to (1,2) occupied, left to (0,3) wall, right to (2,3) occupied.\n\nAll invalid except up, but (1,4) is occupied, not safe.\n\nStuck! No possible move from (1,3) after turn 79.\n\nBecause all adjacent cells are occupied or wall.\n\nSo going left leads to death.\n\nTherefore, I must go right at turn 77 to survive.\n\nFor turn 77, move right to (3,1).\n\nThen I can continue to the right and up.\n\nFor (2,5) food, it will be vacated at some point.\n\nIn the going-right sequence, at turn 80, tail at (2,5), then on turn 81, when I move head to (6,2), tail moves to (3,5), so (2,5) is free with food.\n\nThen I can try to move head to (2,5) to eat it.\n\nBut head is at (6,2), (2,5) is at (2,5), distance |6-2| + |2-5| = 4+3=7 moves, and with the body, it might be possible but takes time.\n\nLife span of (2,5) is 10 at turn 76, so on turn 81, life span: turn 76 L=10, after 76 L=9, turn 77 L=9, after 77 L=8, ..., after turn 80 L=6, turn 81 L=6, etc. Turn 81 L=6, so plenty of time.\n\nBut the snake is long, so moving the head back might be tricky.\n\nPerhaps I can not go all the way right, but from some point go up.\n\nFor example, from (4,1) or (5,1), but I can't go up because cells are occupied.\n\nOnly when I reach (6,2) or (6,3), I can go up to (6,4), etc.\n\nThen from there, I can go left to (5,4) or something.\n\nBut (5,5) food may be gone.\n\nLet's accept that I can't eat (3,6) or (5,5) due to distance and time, so focus on survival and eating (2,5) later.\n\nFor the sequence, since I have to output actions for multiple turns, but the state changes, so I need to provide a sequence based on current state.\n\nBut for simplicity, I can output the first few moves.\n\nThe answer format is to output actions for turn 76, 77, 78, etc., but since the future depends, I can plan a short sequence.\n\nBut the instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should provide a sequence of at least 5 turns.\n\nFor turn 76, move down.\n\nTurn 77, move right.\n\nThen turn 78, move right to (4,1)\n\nTurn 79, move right to (5,1)\n\nTurn 80, move right to (6,1)\n\nTurn 81, move up to (6,2)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut at turn 81, from (6,1) to (6,2), which is safe.\n\nThen from (6,2), move up to (6,3), and so on.\n\nFor the food at (2,5), I can later turn around to eat it.\n\nBut for the sequence, I can output up to 5 turns or more.\n\nSince the snake is at (2,1) after turn 76, and I move right for a few turns, then when (2,5) is free, I can go up and left.\n\nBut for now, let's output the sequence.\n\nAlso, at turn 76, there is food at (2,5), but it's occupied, so cannot eat now.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSo for turn 76: action D (down)\n\nThen turn 77: action R (right)\n\nThen turn 78: action R (right) to (4,1)\n\nTurn 79: action R (right) to (5,1)\n\nTurn 80: action R (right) to (6,1)\n\nThen turn 81: action U (up) to (6,2)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut I need to include in the answer.\n\nPerhaps I can stop at turn 80 or something.\n\nThe format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I can provide a sequence.\n\nSince thinking 5 turns ahead, provide 5 actions.\n\nCurrent turn 76.\n\nSo actions for turn 76 to 80.\n\nTurn 76: D\n\nTurn 77: R\n\nTurn 78: R\n\nTurn 79: R\n\nTurn 80: R\n\nBut at turn 80, head at (6,1), and I can move up on turn 81.\n\nBut for the sequence, up to turn 80 is fine.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nAnother thing: when I move to (6,1) on turn 80, from (5,1), and (6,1) is free, as per earlier.\n\nAlso, for the food, (2,5) can be targeted later.\n\nBut in the sequence, I think this is the way to go.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 76):**\n- **Snake Position**: Head at (2,2), direction down (D). Full body: [(2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1)] (19 segments).\n- **Food**: \n  - (3,6): value +1, life span 4 (available until turn 79).\n  - (5,5): value +1, life span 7 (available until turn 82).\n  - (2,5): value +1, life span 10 (available until turn 85). Currently under the snake's body (segment at (2,5)), so can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n- **Walls**: Borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7; internal obstacle at (4,6). Playable area: x=1-6, y=1-6.\n- **Constraints**: \n  - Current direction is down, so reverse move (up) is invalid for next turn.\n  - Only safe move from (2,2) is down to (2,1) (left and right lead to body collision; up is invalid due to reverse).\n\n**Key Observations and 5+ Turn Strategy:**\n- **Immediate Move (Turn 76)**: Only possible safe move is down (D) to (2,1) to avoid collision. No food at (2,1), so snake length remains 19.\n- **Food Prioritization**:\n  - (3,6) has short life (expires after turn 79) and is too far (min 6 moves from (2,1)), so unreachable in time. Ignore.\n  - (5,5) has medium life (expires after turn 82) but requires ~7 moves from (2,1) via a circuitous path due to body blocks. Unreachable by turn 82 based on simulation.\n  - (2,5) has long life (expires after turn 85) and is currently under the body. It will become accessible when vacated (estimated turn 81 in this plan). Target this for eating around turn 81-82.\n- **Survival Focus**: \n  - Moving right from (2,1) avoids dead ends (left leads to a trap by turn 79) and opens space.\n  - After reaching the right wall, move up to access the top area where (2,5) can be approached.\n  - **Tail Reward Danger**: When targeting (2,5), ensure the head is not adjacent to the tail when eating to avoid collision.\n- **Simulated Path (Turns 76-81)**:\n  - Turn 76: Down to (2,1) – safe, no food.\n  - Turn 77: Right to (3,1) – safe, no food.\n  - Turn 78: Right to (4,1) – safe, no food.\n  - Turn 79: Right to (5,1) – safe, no food.\n  - Turn 80: Right to (6,1) – safe, no food.\n  - Turn 81: Up to (6,2) – safe, no food. By this turn, (2,5) is vacated (tail moves away), so head can start navigating toward it.\n- **Long-Term (Beyond 5 Turns)**: \n  - From (6,2), continue up to (6,3), (6,4), then left to (5,4), (5,5) (if still available), or directly toward (2,5) via a safe path (e.g., (6,4) → (6,5) → (5,5) if life permits, or (5,4) → (4,4) → ... → (2,5)).\n  - Eat (2,5) around turn 81-85 when head is adjacent and the cell is free. Monitor tail position to avoid Tail Reward Danger.\n\n**Action Sequence (Turns 76-80):**  \nBased on the above, the sequence for the next 5 turns is deterministic to ensure survival and position for future food access.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 76: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 77: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 78: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 79: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 80: R (right)\n}",

        "step": 77,
        "score": 18,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 77, and I'm the snake AI. My goal is to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I must think at least 5 turns ahead, prioritizing long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nLet me parse the grid setup. The walls are defined: border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the edges. There's also an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: The snake is a list of coordinates starting from the head. Head is at (2,1), and the body segments follow. The direction is given as \"D\", which is down. So the head is moving down.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (3,6) with life span 3 and value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (5,5) with life span 6 and value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (2,5) with life span 9 and value 1 (positive food)\n\nAll food is positive, so no negative food in this state. Value 1 means +1 for eating.\n\nNow, life span: for (3,6), life span 3 means it disappears after 3 turns, including the current turn. So on turn 77, life span 3; turn 78, it becomes 2; turn 79, it becomes 1; and on turn 80, it disappears if not eaten.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) has life span 6, so it will last until turn 82 (77+5=82? Let's calculate: turn 77: life 6, turn 78:5, ..., turn 82:1, turn 83:0 so gone on turn 83? Better to think in terms of turns left.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn t, if life span is N, it will be present for N more turns, disappearing after N turns. For (3,6), life span 3 at turn 77, so it can be eaten on turns 77, 78, or 79, and disappears on turn 80.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) life span 6: can be eaten up to turn 82, gone on turn 83.\n\n(2,5) life span 9: up to turn 85, gone on turn 86.\n\nNow, snake positions: Head at (2,1), direction down. So moving down to (2,0)? But y=0 is a wall, so moving down would hit the wall if I go to (2,0). y=0 is the bottom wall, I think. Coordinates: let's define the grid.\n\nAssuming (0,0) is bottom-left, (7,7) top-right? But in the walls, y=0 and y=7 are borders. Snake head at (2,1), and moving down. If down decreases y, then (2,1) down to (2,0) would hit wall since y=0 is wall.\n\nBut in the state, it says head direction is D (down), and current position is (2,1). But (2,1) down to (2,0) is invalid because y=0 is wall. So I need to move in a different direction immediately.\n\nThe snake can't move into a wall, so from (2,1), moving down to (2,0) is impossible. Therefore, I must change direction. But I have to consider the movement constraints.\n\nFirst, list all possible moves from current position.\n\nHead is at (2,1), direction down. But since I can't move down, I need to choose another direction.\n\nPossible directions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).\n\nBut no instant reverse: since current direction is down, I cannot move up, because up is opposite to down. Reverse of down is up.\n\nSo, from down, I cannot move up on the next turn.\n\nTherefore, from (2,1), with direction down, possible moves: left (L) to (1,1) or right (R) to (3,1), but not up or down.\n\nDown is invalid because wall, up is invalid because reverse not allowed? No, up is possible if not reverse, but reverse is not allowed only if it's opposite.\n\nCurrent direction down, so opposite is up. So I cannot move up.\n\nTherefore, only left or right are possible.\n\nNow, check if those cells are free and not walls.\n\nFirst, left to (1,1): is (1,1) occupied by snake or wall?\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So (1,1) is within bounds, not a wall.\n\nSnake positions: let's list all snake segments to see what cells are occupied.\n\nSnake positions: [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]\n\nSo, head at (2,1), then body: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)\n\n(1,2) is the tail, I think.\n\nNow, (1,1) is not in the snake positions, so it should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) is not listed, so should be free.\n\nAlso, walls: only borders and (4,6), so (1,1) and (3,1) are not walls.\n\nTherefore, from (2,1), I can move left to (1,1) or right to (3,1).\n\nI need to think ahead for at least 5 turns.\n\nAlso, food positions: (3,6), (5,5), (2,5)\n\n(2,5) is listed as food, but (2,5) is also a snake position? Snake positions include (2,5), which is part of the body.\n\nFood can spawn under the snake's body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves onto it.\n\nIn this case, (2,5) has food, but it's currently occupied by the snake body. Specifically, looking at snake positions: (2,5) is the 15th segment or something.\n\nList indices: position 0: (2,1) head, 1: (2,2), 2: (2,3), 3: (2,4), 4: (3,4), 5: (3,3), 6: (3,2), 7: (4,2), 8: (5,2), 9: (5,3), 10: (4,3), 11: (4,4), 12: (4,5), 13: (3,5), 14: (2,5), 15: (1,5), 16: (1,4), 17: (1,3), 18: (1,2)\n\nSo (2,5) is position 14 in the list, so it's a body segment, not the tail. Tail is (1,2).\n\nFood at (2,5) is under the body, so to eat it, the snake must move such that (2,5) is vacated, and then head moves to (2,5).\n\nBut (2,5) is currently occupied, so I need to move the body away first.\n\nSimilarly, other food: (3,6) and (5,5) are not occupied, I think? Let's check if they are in snake positions.\n\n(3,6): not in the list, so free.\n\n(5,5): not in list, free.\n\n(2,5) is in list, so occupied.\n\nNow, for (2,5) food, it has life span 9, so plenty of time.\n\nBut I need to plan moves.\n\nFirst, current turn 77, head at (2,1), direction down, but can't move down, so must move left or right.\n\nOptions: L to (1,1) or R to (3,1).\n\nI need to simulate both and see which is better for long-term survival and eating food.\n\nAlso, after moving, the direction will change, so for future moves, I have to consider the new direction.\n\nMoreover, the snake will move: when I move, the head goes to new position, and the tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed, and if I eat food, a new segment is added at the tail, so length increases.\n\nBut in this case, no food eaten yet.\n\nNow, let's think about the grid layout. I should sketch a grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. (0,0) to (7,7).\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n\nFrom positions: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)\n\nSo the snake is coiled around. Let's sort by coordinates to see.\n\nx=1: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n\nx=2: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n\nx=3: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n\nx=4: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nx=5: (5,2), (5,3)\n\nAnd (3,2) etc.\n\nAlso, head at (2,1) moving down, but stuck.\n\nFood at: (3,6), (5,5), (2,5) but (2,5) occupied.\n\nNow, for turn 77, I must choose L or R.\n\nOption 1: Move Left to (1,1)\n\nAfter move, new head position (1,1), new direction left (since I moved left).\n\nThen the tail moves, so tail was (1,2), which moves? When head moves to (1,1), the body follows, so the segment at (1,2) might change.\n\nWhen snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the next position, so the last segment (tail) is removed, and if no food eaten, length same.\n\nHere, no food at (1,1), so after moving to (1,1), the new snake positions: head at (1,1), then the previous head (2,1) becomes body, so positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), ..., and tail (1,2) is removed since no growth.\n\nThe list: original positions 0 to 18: indices 0 to 18.\n\nAfter move, head to new position, then position 1 becomes new position 1, but shifted.\n\nNew positions: head at (1,1), then previous position 0: (2,1) becomes the first body segment, position 1: (2,2) becomes next, and so on, up to position 17: (1,3) becomes position 17, and position 18: (1,2) is removed.\n\nOriginal: pos0: (2,1), pos1: (2,2), pos2: (2,3), ..., pos17: (1,3), pos18: (1,2)\n\nAfter move left to (1,1): new head (1,1), then new pos1: old pos0 (2,1), new pos2: old pos1 (2,2), ..., new pos18: old pos17 (1,3), and old pos18 (1,2) is removed. Since length 19, after move no growth, length 19, but tail removed, so new positions from index 0 to 17? Original 19 segments, after move, 18 segments? No.\n\nSnake has N segments. When it moves without eating, head to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail segment is vacated.\n\nNumber of segments remains the same only if no food eaten; if food eaten, a new segment is added at the tail position before move.\n\nHere, no food, so after move, snake has same length, positions: head at new position, then body segments shift.\n\nOriginal positions: 19 segments.\n\nAfter move: new head position (1,1), then the first body segment is at old head position (2,1), second body at old first body (2,2), and so on, up to the 18th body at old 18th body position, but the old tail (1,2) is not part of snake anymore.\n\nLet's index: let the segments be S0 (head), S1, S2, ..., S18 (tail).\n\nAfter move to new head position, new S0 = new position, new S1 = old S0, new S2 = old S1, ..., new S18 = old S17, and old S18 is removed. Since no food, new snake has one less segment? No.\n\nIf no food eaten, the snake moves, so the head moves to new cell, the tail is removed, so the new snake has the same number of segments, but the last segment is gone, and all shift.\n\nFor example, from 19 segments, after move, it becomes 18 segments: head at new, then S1 to S18 become the body from old S0 to S17.\n\nS0 new = new head\n\nS1 new = old S0\n\nS2 new = old S1\n\n...\n\nS18 new = old S17\n\nAnd old S18 is removed. But if there were 19 segments, after move, there are only 18 segments, because tail is removed.\n\nIn terms of positions, the snake occupies one fewer cell if no growth.\n\nStandard snake: when you move, if no food, head to new, body follows, tail cell is vacated, so the snake has the same number of segments, but the segments shift: the tail segment is left, so the new snake has segments from the new head to the second-to-last old position.\n\nFor a snake with segments: P0 (head), P1, P2, ..., Pk (tail).\n\nAfter moving to a new cell Q without eating:\n\n- New head: Q\n\n- New body: P0, P1, P2, ..., P_{k-1}  // so Pk is removed, and the new snake has segments: Q, P0, P1, ..., P_{k-1} which is k+1 positions? No.\n\nOriginal: positions P0 to Pk, total k+1 segments.\n\nAfter move: head to Q, then the new body starts at P0, then P1, up to P_{k-1}, so the new positions are: Q, P0, P1, ..., P_{k-1} , which has (k+1) positions, but the last one is P_{k-1}, so the tail is at P_{k-1}, and Pk is removed.\n\nNumber of segments remains the same: original k+1 segments, new k+1 segments: from Q to P_{k-1}.\n\nFor example, here: 19 segments, indices 0 to 18.\n\nAfter move, new head at (1,1), new position 0: (1,1)\n\nNew position 1: old position 0 (2,1)\n\nNew position 2: old position 1 (2,2)\n\n...\n\nNew position 18: old position 17 (1,3)\n\nAnd old position 18 (1,2) is removed, no longer part of snake.\n\nSo new snake has 19 segments? New position 18 is old position 17 (1,3), so tail at (1,3).\n\nOriginal tail was (1,2), now tail is (1,3).\n\nSimilarly, for move right to (3,1).\n\nBut back to turn 77.\n\nFirst, I need to choose action for turn 77.\n\nOptions: L or R.\n\nLet's evaluate L: move left to (1,1)\n\nAfter move, head at (1,1), direction left.\n\nNow, from here, possible moves for next turn.\n\nCurrent direction left, so cannot move right (opposite).\n\nPossible moves: up, down, left.\n\n(1,1): up to (1,2), down to (1,0), left to (0,1)\n\nBut y=0 is wall, so down to (1,0) invalid.\n\nLeft to (0,1): x=0 is wall, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is up to (1,2).\n\nBut (1,2) is currently occupied by the snake body? In new positions after move.\n\nAfter move to (1,1), new positions:\n\nHead: (1,1)\n\nThen: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,3)? Tail.\n\nOld positions: after move, new pos0: (1,1)\n\nNew pos1: old pos0 (2,1)\n\nNew pos2: old pos1 (2,2)\n\nNew pos3: old pos2 (2,3)\n\nNew pos4: old pos3 (2,4)\n\nNew pos5: old pos4 (3,4)\n\nNew pos6: old pos5 (3,3)\n\nNew pos7: old pos6 (3,2)\n\nNew pos8: old pos7 (4,2)\n\nNew pos9: old pos8 (5,2)\n\nNew pos10: old pos9 (5,3)\n\nNew pos11: old pos10 (4,3)\n\nNew pos12: old pos11 (4,4)\n\nNew pos13: old pos12 (4,5)\n\nNew pos14: old pos13 (3,5)\n\nNew pos15: old pos14 (2,5)\n\nNew pos16: old pos15 (1,5)\n\nNew pos17: old pos16 (1,4)\n\nNew pos18: old pos17 (1,3)  // since old pos17 was (1,4)? Original positions:\n\nOriginal: pos0: (2,1) head\n\npos1: (2,2)\n\npos2: (2,3)\n\npos3: (2,4)\n\npos4: (3,4)\n\npos5: (3,3)\n\npos6: (3,2)\n\npos7: (4,2)\n\npos8: (5,2)\n\npos9: (5,3)\n\npos10: (4,3)\n\npos11: (4,4)\n\npos12: (4,5)\n\npos13: (3,5)\n\npos14: (2,5)\n\npos15: (1,5)\n\npos16: (1,4)\n\npos17: (1,3)\n\npos18: (1,2) tail\n\nAfter move left to (1,1):\n\nNew head: (1,1)\n\nNew body: old pos0 to pos17 become new pos1 to pos18.\n\nNew pos0: (1,1) head\n\nNew pos1: old pos0 (2,1)\n\nNew pos2: old pos1 (2,2)\n\n...\n\nNew pos18: old pos17 (1,3)\n\nAnd old pos18 (1,2) is removed.\n\nSo new snake positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)]\n\nTail at (1,3).\n\nNow, from head at (1,1), direction left (since moved left).\n\nFor turn 78, possible moves:\n\n- Up to (1,2)\n\n- Down to (1,0) invalid wall\n\n- Left to (0,1) invalid wall\n\n- Right to (2,1) but right is opposite to left? Current direction left, opposite is right, so cannot move right.\n\nNo instant reverse: so from left, cannot move right.\n\nTherefore, only possible move is up to (1,2).\n\nBut (1,2) is currently occupied by the snake? In new positions, (1,2) is not listed; positions are (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), etc., and (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), but not (1,2).\n\n(1,2) was old tail, removed, so it's free now.\n\nSo (1,2) is empty, not wall, so I can move up to (1,2).\n\nThen, if I move up to (1,2), new head at (1,2), and since I moved up, direction up.\n\nThen the body follows, tail at (1,3) removed if no food.\n\nBut (1,2) has no food, so no growth.\n\nThen new positions: head (1,2), then (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), ..., up to (1,4) or something.\n\nBut the point is, from (1,1), I can only move to (1,2) on turn 78.\n\nThen from there, I need to continue.\n\nBut this seems risky because I'm moving into a narrow space.\n\nFrom (1,2), with direction up, I can move up, down, left, right, but no reverse, so from up, cannot move down.\n\n(1,2): up to (1,3), down to (1,1) invalid reverse, left to (0,2) invalid wall, right to (2,2).\n\nSo possible up to (1,3) or right to (2,2).\n\n(1,3) is occupied by snake? After previous move, from turn 77 to (1,1), then turn 78 to (1,2), new positions:\n\nAfter turn 78 move to (1,2):\n\nNew head: (1,2)\n\nNew body: new pos1: old head (1,1), new pos2: old pos1 (2,1), new pos3: old pos2 (2,2), ..., new pos18: old pos17 (1,4)? Let's not get bogged down.\n\nThe key point is that moving left on turn 77 forces me to go to (1,2) on turn 78, and then I'm at (1,2) with body around, and (1,3) is occupied, so if I move up to (1,3), I collide with my own body.\n\nAfter turn 77 move to (1,1), positions include (1,3) at new pos18.\n\nThen turn 78 move to (1,2), new positions: head (1,2), then (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4)  // and tail at (1,4), since old pos18 was (1,3), but removed? After turn 77, new pos18 is (1,3)\n\nAfter turn 77: positions: (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)  // 19 positions.\n\nThen turn 78, move up to (1,2): new head at (1,2)\n\nThen new body: new pos1: old pos0 (1,1), new pos2: old pos1 (2,1), new pos3: old pos2 (2,2), new pos4: old pos3 (2,3), new pos5: old pos4 (2,4), new pos6: old pos5 (3,4), new pos7: old pos6 (3,3), new pos8: old pos7 (3,2), new pos9: old pos8 (4,2), new pos10: old pos9 (5,2), new pos11: old pos10 (5,3), new pos12: old pos11 (4,3), new pos13: old pos12 (4,4), new pos14: old pos13 (4,5), new pos15: old pos14 (3,5), new pos16: old pos15 (2,5), new pos17: old pos16 (1,5), new pos18: old pos17 (1,4)\n\nAnd old pos18 (1,3) is removed.\n\nSo new positions: head (1,2), then (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4)\n\nTail at (1,4).\n\nNow, from (1,2), direction up (since moved up).\n\nFor turn 79, possible moves:\n\n- Up to (1,3)\n\n- Down to (1,1) invalid reverse\n\n- Left to (0,2) invalid wall\n\n- Right to (2,2)\n\n(1,3) is not in the new positions; positions have (1,4) but not (1,3), so (1,3) is free.\n\n(2,2) is occupied by snake, new pos3: (2,2)\n\nSo if I move up to (1,3), it's free, no problem.\n\nIf I move right to (2,2), it's occupied, collision.\n\nSo only possible move is up to (1,3).\n\nThen continue, but I'm moving up along x=1, and the body is at (1,4), (1,5), so I might get stuck or collide soon.\n\nAfter moving to (1,3) on turn 79, head at (1,3), but (1,3) was not occupied before, but after move, it will be.\n\nThis path seems to lead to a dead end quickly, as I'm trapped in the left column.\n\nFor example, after turn 79 move to (1,3), then from there, I can move up to (1,4) or right to (2,3), etc., but (1,4) is occupied, so I have to move right or other directions.\n\nBut it's messy and risky. Not good for long-term.\n\nSo moving left on turn 77 might be bad.\n\nNow, option 2: move right on turn 77 to (3,1)\n\nFrom (2,1) move right to (3,1)\n\nNew head at (3,1), direction right.\n\nThen new positions: head (3,1), then (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)  // and tail (1,2) removed?

So on turn 80, it has 3 turns left.\n\nI can try to eat (5,5) from my path.\n\nBut let's see if I can plan to eat food.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (2,5) is under the body, so I need to vacate it first.\n\nCurrently, (2,5) is occupied by the snake body.\n\nIn the snake positions, (2,5) is a body segment, and food is there.\n\nTo eat it, the snake must move so that (2,5) is no longer occupied, then head moves to it.\n\nSince the snake is moving, the body will shift, so (2,5) might be vacated when the tail moves away.\n\nFor example, if I move in a way that the tail moves, (2,5) could be free.\n\nBut it's complicated.\n\nPerhaps for short-term, moving right is safer.\n\nBut let's consider turn 77 action only for now.\n\nSince I need to output multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nThe answer format is to specify actions for turn t1, t1+1, t1+2, etc.\n\nt1=77.\n\nSo I need to decide actions for turn 77 to at least 82 or something.\n\nBut I can simulate from here.\n\nFirst, on turn 77, moving left seems bad, as it traps me.\n\nMoving right allows me to escape to the right side.\n\nSo I should move right on turn 77 to (3,1).\n\nThen, as above, on turn 78, I must move right to (4,1).\n\nTurn 79, move right to (5,1).\n\nTurn 80, move right to (6,1).\n\nNow at (6,1), direction right.\n\nFor turn 81, possible moves:\n\nFrom (6,1), current direction right.\n\nCannot move left.\n\nPossible: up to (6,2), down to (6,0) invalid, right to (7,1) but x=7 is wall, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is up to (6,2).\n\nMove to (6,2) on turn 81.\n\nDirection up (since moved up).\n\nNow, (6,2) is free? Let's see positions.\n\nAfter turn 80 at (6,1), positions: head (6,1), then (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)  // tail at (2,5)? After turn 80 move to (6,1):\n\nPrevious after turn 79: head (5,1), positions (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5)  // from earlier, after turn 79, positions include (1,5) at tail.\n\nAfter turn 79 move to (5,1): positions (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5)\n\nThen turn 80 move to (6,1): new head (6,1), new pos1: (5,1), new pos2: (4,1), new pos3: (3,1), new pos4: (2,1), new pos5: (2,2), new pos6: (2,3), new pos7: (2,4), new pos8: (3,4), new pos9: (3,3), new pos10: (3,2), new pos11: (4,2), new pos12: (5,2), new pos13: (5,3), new pos14: (4,3), new pos15: (4,4), new pos16: (4,5), new pos17: (3,5), new pos18: (2,5)\n\nOld pos18 (1,5) removed.\n\nSo positions: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nTail at (2,5).\n\nNow, food at (2,5) has life span 9, but it's currently occupied by the tail? (2,5) is position new pos18, which is the tail.\n\nBut there is food at (2,5), and it's the tail.\n\nNow, if I move the head to (2,5), but it's the tail, I need to be careful.\n\nSpecial case: Tail Reward Danger: If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nHere, head is at (6,1), tail at (2,5), not adjacent, so no immediate danger.\n\nBut the food is at tail position.\n\nTo eat it, I need to move so that the tail moves, and (2,5) is vacated, then head can move to it.\n\nBut it's far away.\n\nBack to turn 81.\n\nHead at (6,1), move up to (6,2).\n\nNew head (6,2), direction up.\n\nThen positions: head (6,2), then (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)  // tail at (3,5)? After move to (6,2), new pos1: (6,1), new pos2: (5,1), ..., new pos18: (3,5) since old pos17 was (3,5), and old tail (2,5) removed.\n\nOld positions: (6,1), (5,1), ..., (2,5) with (2,5) tail.\n\nNew: head (6,2), new pos1: old pos0 (6,1), new pos2: old pos1 (5,1), ..., new pos18: old pos17 (3,5)\n\nOld pos17 was (3,5), so new tail at (3,5).\n\nPositions: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)\n\nTail at (3,5).\n\nFood at (5,5) is at (5,5), which is not occupied, and I can try to eat it.\n\nFrom (6,2), direction up, I can move up, down, left, right, but no reverse, so from up, cannot move down.\n\n(6,2): up to (6,3), down to (6,1) invalid reverse, left to (5,2), right to (7,2) invalid wall.\n\n(6,3) is free? Not in positions, not wall.\n\n(5,2) is occupied, new pos12: (5,2) or something, positions have (5,2) at new pos12? New positions: index 0: (6,2), 1: (6,1), 2: (5,1), 3: (4,1), 4: (3,1), 5: (2,1), 6: (2,2), 7: (2,3), 8: (2,4), 9: (3,4), 10: (3,3), 11: (3,2), 12: (4,2), 13: (5,2), 14: (5,3), 15: (4,3), 16: (4,4), 17: (4,5), 18: (3,5)\n\nSo (5,2) is pos13, occupied.\n\n(6,3) not occupied, free.\n\nSo I can move up to (6,3) on turn 82.\n\nSimilarly, continue to (6,4), (6,5), etc., to reach (5,5).\n\n(5,5) is at (5,5), so from (6,5) or something.\n\nBut I need to output actions for turns 77 to at least 81 or 82.\n\nSince the food (3,6) is expiring soon, but I can't reach it, so ignore.\n\n(5,5) is available.\n\nAnother option: on turn 77, instead of moving right, is there a way to go towards food?\n\nBut from (2,1), only left or right possible.\n\nMove right is better.\n\nPerhaps I can move right and then up early.\n\nOn turn 77, move right to (3,1).\n\nThen on turn 78, from (3,1), I had to move to (4,1), but is there another choice? Earlier I said only move right to (4,1) because up to (3,2) occupied.\n\nBut at that time, (3,2) was occupied.\n\nAfter turn 77 move to (3,1), positions: (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), etc.\n\n(3,2) is occupied, so yes, only move right.\n\nSimilarly, subsequent moves are forced until (6,1).\n\nThen at (6,1), move up to (6,2).\n\nThen at (6,2), move up to (6,3) on turn 82.\n\nThen to (6,4), (6,5), etc.\n\nBut (5,5) is at (5,5), so from (6,5), I can move left to (5,5) to eat it.\n\nBut need to see when.\n\nFirst, let's list actions for turn 77 to 81.\n\nTurn 77: move right to (3,1)\n\nTurn 78: move right to (4,1)\n\nTurn 79: move right to (5,1)\n\nTurn 80: move right to (6,1)\n\nTurn 81: move up to (6,2)\n\nNow, at turn 81, head at (6,2), direction up.\n\nFor turn 82, I can move up to (6,3)\n\n(6,3) is free, no issue.\n\nThen turn 82: move up to (6,3)\n\nDirection up.\n\nThen turn 83: move up to (6,4)\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) free.\n\nTurn 84: move up to (6,5)\n\n(6,5) free.\n\nNow, at (6,5), direction up.\n\nFood at (5,5) is at (5,5), adjacent left.\n\nI can move left to (5,5) on turn 85.\n\nBut current direction up, so moving left is allowed, not reverse.\n\n(5,5) has food, value 1, so I can eat it.\n\nLife span: at turn 77, life 6, so on turn 85? Turn 77: life 6, 78:5, 79:4, 80:3, 81:2, 82:1, 83:0 so gone on turn 83? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n\nAt turn t, life span N, it disappears after N turns, so present for t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, gone on t+N.\n\nSo for (5,5), at turn 77, life span 6, so present on turns 77,78,79,80,81,82 (since 77+5=82? Turns: 77 to 82 inclusive is 6 turns? From turn 77 to turn 77+5=82, that's 6 turns: 77,78,79,80,81,82.\n\nLife span N at turn t: available on turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1.\n\nFor example, N=6 at t=77: available on 77,78,79,80,81,82. Gone on 83.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) at t=77, life 3: available 77,78,79, gone 80.\n\n(2,5) life 9: available 77 to 85, gone 86.\n\nOn turn 85, (5,5) is gone, since disappeared on 83.\n\nTurn 85 is after 83, so not available.\n\nOn turn 82, (5,5) is still available, life span 1 (since turn 82: life span decreases to 1? At turn t, for food, at start of turn, life span is given, then after the turn, if not eaten, it decreases.\n\nBut the state is at the beginning of turn.\n\nIn the food description, it's given with life span at current turn.\n\nSo at turn 77, life span for (5,5) is 6, meaning it has 6 turns left including current.\n\nAfter each turn, if not eaten, life span decreases by 1.\n\nSo at turn 78, life span becomes 5, and so on.\n\nAt turn 82, life span is 1 (82-77=5, but at turn 77:6, 78:5, 79:4, 80:3, 81:2, 82:1), so on turn 82, it has life span 1, so it can be eaten on turn 82, and disappears after that if not eaten.\n\nSimilarly, on turn 83, it would be gone.\n\nNow, in my path, on turn 82, I am at (6,3) if I moved up on turn 82.\n\nLet's sequence:\n\nTurn 81: at (6,2)\n\nTurn 82: move up to (6,3)\n\nAt (6,3), direction up.\n\nThen turn 83: move up to (6,4)\n\nAt (6,4), direction up.\n\nTurn 84: move up to (6,5)\n\nAt (6,5), direction up.\n\n(5,5) is at (5,5), which is left of (6,5).\n\nOn turn 85, I can move left to (5,5).\n\nBut on turn 85, (5,5) is gone, since disappeared on turn 83.\n\nOn turn 82, I am at (6,2) at the start of turn 82.\n\nI can move to (6,3) or other directions.\n\nFrom (6,2), at turn 82, I can move up to (6,3), or since direction up, I can move left or right, but not down.\n\n(6,2): up to (6,3), left to (5,2), right invalid.\n\n(5,2) is occupied, as in positions.\n\nSo only move up to (6,3).\n\nSimilarly, on turn 83 at (6,3), move up to (6,4).\n\nTurn 84 at (6,4), move up to (6,5).\n\nAt (6,5), on turn 85, move left to (5,5), but (5,5) gone.\n\nI can try to reach (5,5) earlier.\n\nFor example, from (6,1) on turn 81, I moved up to (6,2).\n\nBut at (6,1), on turn 81, I could only move up, as down invalid, right invalid, left to (5,1) but occupied.\n\n(5,1) is body, so occupied.\n\nNo choice.\n\nSo I cannot eat (5,5) because it expires before I can reach it.\n\n(2,5) food is available longer.\n\nBut it's at (2,5), and I am at (6,5) on turn 84, far away.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (4,6) might affect.\n\nBut for now, moving right on turn 77 allows me to survive longer.\n\nPerhaps I can move differently after turn 77.\n\nAnother idea: on turn 77, move right to (3,1), then on turn 78 to (4,1), but from there, I had to go to (5,1), etc.\n\nBut at (4,1), on turn 79, I moved to (5,1), but I could have moved up if possible, but (4,2) was occupied.\n\nIn the positions, (4,2) is occupied.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps for the food at (2,5), since it's the tail at some point, I can eat it when the tail moves.\n\nBut it's complicated.\n\nSince I need to output actions, and moving right is safe for now, I'll go with that.\n\nAlso, the food at (3,6) is expiring, but I can't reach it from here.\n\nAt turn 77, head at (2,1), (3,6) is at (3,6), far away, and with walls, I can't reach in time.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo for survival, moving right is better.\n\nThen for the actions, I can plan the next few turns.\n\nBut to think 5 turns ahead, from turn 77 to 81.\n\nTurn 77: R (right) to (3,1)\n\nTurn 78: R to (4,1)\n\nTurn 79: R to (5,1)\n\nTurn 80: R to (6,1)\n\nTurn 81: U (up) to (6,2)\n\nThen beyond, but for answer, I need to specify from turn 77 to at least 81 or 82.\n\nThe format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" and I should do for 5 turns or more.\n\nSince t1=77, I can do up to turn 82.\n\nBut on turn 82, from (6,2), I move U to (6,3), as above.\n\nBut let's confirm the grid.\n\nAlso, there is the internal obstacle at (4,6), but it doesn't affect the path so far.\n\nNow, for the food at (2,5), with life span 9, I can plan to eat it later.\n\nBut for now, the immediate actions are determined.\n\nPerhaps on turn 77, I can move left, but it was risky.\n\nAnother thought: from (2,1), move right to (3,1), then on turn 78 to (4,1), turn 79 to (5,1), but at (5,1), on turn 80, I move to (6,1), but I could have moved up from (5,1) on turn 80 if possible, but from (5,1), direction right, so I can move up or right, not left.\n\n(5,1): up to (5,2), but (5,2) occupied, down invalid, right to (6,1) free, so only right.\n\nSo no choice.\n\nThus, the actions are forced for the first few turns.\n\nSo for answer:\n\nTurn 77: R\n\nTurn 78: R\n\nTurn 79: R\n\nTurn 80: R\n\nTurn 81: U\n\nThen for turn 82, from (6,2), move U to (6,3)\n\nBut since I need to output, I can include more.\n\nThe core is to survive and eat food when possible.\n\nAt (6,2), I can consider moving to other places, but only U possible.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think this is fine.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 77: R (right)\n\nTurn 78: R\n\nTurn 79: R\n\nTurn 80: R\n\nTurn 81: U\n\nFor 5 turns.\n\nBut turn 77 to 81 is 5 actions: turns 77,78,79,80,81.\n\nYes.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nIn the state, snake head direction is D, but after first move, it changes.\n\nIn the output, I need to specify the action.\n\nNow, for the boxed answer.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 77):**\n- **Snake Position**: Head at (2,1), moving down (D). The snake body occupies multiple cells, including (2,5) where positive food is present but currently under the body. The tail is at (1,2).\n- **Food**:\n  - (3,6): Value +1, life span 3 (disappears after turn 79).\n  - (5,5): Value +1, life span 6 (disappears after turn 82).\n  - (2,5): Value +1, life span 9 (disappears after turn 85), but occupied by the snake body and can only be eaten if vacated first.\n- **Walls and Obstacles**: Borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacle at (4,6).\n- **Movement Constraints**: \n  - From (2,1) with direction D (down), moving down to (2,0) is invalid (wall at y=0). \n  - Reverse move (U, up) is not allowed due to no instant reverse. \n  - Valid moves: Left (L) to (1,1) or Right (R) to (3,1).\n\n**Key Risks and Opportunities:**\n- **Immediate Risk**: Moving left (L) to (1,1) leads to a dead end by turn 79, as it forces movement into a confined space near the left wall, risking collision with the body or walls within 2-3 turns. This path is unsafe and limits long-term survival.\n- **Right Path (R to (3,1))**: \n  - Allows escape to the right side, opening space for movement.\n  - Food at (5,5) is reachable by turn 82, but its life span expires after turn 82, making it critical to eat by then.\n  - Food at (2,5) has a long life span but requires vacating the cell first. It can be targeted later after moving away.\n  - Food at (3,6) expires soon (after turn 79) and is unreachable safely from the current position, so it is ignored.\n- **5+ Turn Plan**:\n  - **Turn 77-80**: Move right (R) consecutively to (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1). This is forced due to body blocks and walls, ensuring survival.\n  - **Turn 81**: Move up (U) to (6,2) to start ascending toward (5,5).\n  - **Turn 82**: Move up (U) to (6,3), then continue to (6,4) and (6,5) to position for eating (5,5) on turn 82 (last chance before it disappears).\n- **Long-Term Survival**: After eating (5,5) on turn 82 (if possible), focus on vacating (2,5) and eating it later. The right path avoids immediate collisions and maintains flexibility.\n\n**Simulated Moves (Turns 77-82):**\n- **Turn 77**: Move R to (3,1) – Safe, avoids left dead end.\n- **Turn 78**: Move R to (4,1) – Only valid move (up blocked by body at (3,2), down invalid).\n- **Turn 79**: Move R to (5,1) – Only valid move (up blocked by body at (4,2), down invalid).\n- **Turn 80**: Move R to (6,1) – Only valid move (up blocked by body at (5,2), down invalid).\n- **Turn 81**: Move U to (6,2) – Only valid move (right to (7,1) invalid wall, left to (5,1) blocked by body).\n- **Turn 82**: Move U to (6,3) – Positions to reach (5,5) by moving left from (6,5) on a later turn (but (5,5) must be eaten this turn; see below).\n\n**Food Eating Strategy:**\n- **(5,5) on Turn 82**: From (6,3) on turn 82, move to (6,4) on turn 83, then to (6,5) on turn 84. However, (5,5) expires after turn 82, so it cannot be eaten after turn 82. Since (5,5) is at (5,5) and the head is at (6,3) on turn 82, it is not adjacent. Thus, (5,5) cannot be eaten in this sequence and will disappear. Survival is prioritized over this food.\n- **(2,5) Later**: After turn 82, the snake can loop back to (2,5) once vacated (e.g., by moving the tail away). This is safe as it has a long life span (until turn 85).\n\n**Collision and Risk Check**:\n- No collisions occur in the sequence: Moves avoid walls, body segments, and obstacles.\n- Tail Reward Danger: Not triggered, as head is never adjacent to tail during these moves.\n\n**Conclusion**: Moving right for the first 4 turns ensures survival and opens the board. Actions are forced until turn 81, with turn 82 beginning the ascent. Output includes 6 turns (77-82) to show the full 5+ turn plan.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 77: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 78: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 79: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 80: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 81: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 82: U (up)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 78. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (4,6). So, the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the edges and one block at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: The head is at (3,1), and the direction is right (R). The body segments follow: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3). Let me list them in order:\n\n- Head: (3,1)\n\n- Next: (2,1)\n\n- Then: (2,2)\n\n- (2,3)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (3,3)  -- that seems odd; from (2,4) to (3,4), then to (3,3)? Let's plot this to visualize.\n\nI should sketch a grid. Rows y=0 to y=7, columns x=0 to x=7.\n\nSnake body:\n\nIndex 0: (3,1) head\n\n1: (2,1)\n\n2: (2,2)\n\n3: (2,3)\n\n4: (2,4)\n\n5: (3,4)\n\n6: (3,3)  -- so from (2,4) to (3,4) to (3,3), which is left or down? (3,4) to (3,3) is down, since y decreases? No, y=0 is bottom or top? The problem doesn't specify, but typically in grids, y increases up or down? Let's see the directions: U is (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top. So moving up increases y.\n\nSo from (3,4) to (3,3) is down (y decreases).\n\nThen:\n\n7: (3,2) -- from (3,3) to (3,2) down again? (3,3) to (3,2) is down.\n\n8: (4,2) -- from (3,2) to (4,2) right (x increases).\n\n9: (5,2) -- right to (5,2)\n\n10: (5,3) -- up to (5,3)\n\n11: (4,3) -- left to (4,3)\n\n12: (4,4) -- up to (4,4)\n\n13: (4,5) -- up to (4,5)\n\n14: (3,5) -- left to (3,5)\n\n15: (2,5) -- left to (2,5)\n\n16: (1,5) -- left to (1,5)\n\n17: (1,4) -- down to (1,4)\n\n18: (1,3) -- down to (1,3)\n\nTail is (1,3).\n\nNow, the snake length: positions from 0 to 18, that's 19 segments? Indices: 0 to 18 inclusive is 19 cells. Let's count: (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3). That's 19 positions. So snake length is 19.\n\nHead direction is R, right, so moving east.\n\nFood:\n\n- (3,6) with value 1, life span 2 (so disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 78, life span 2, it will disappear after turn 79? Let's see: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, if life span is N, it decreases to N-1 at turn t+1, and so on, until 0, then it disappears. So for food at (3,6): life span 2 at turn 78, so after turn 78, life span becomes 1, after turn 79, life span 0, disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 78 or 79.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) value 1, life span 5: at turn 78, life span 5, so disappears after turn 82? After turn 78, span=4; turn 79, span=3; turn 80, span=2; turn 81, span=1; turn 82, span=0, disappear. So can be eaten from turn 78 to 82.\n\nAnd (2,5) value 1, life span 8: at turn 78, span=8, disappears after turn 85.\n\nAll food has value 1, positive, since penalty would be -1, but here all are 1.\n\nNow, I need to choose actions for the next few turns, thinking 5+ turns ahead, prioritizing long-term survival.\n\nCurrent head at (3,1), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R. But cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is R (right), so opposite is L (left). So cannot move left on next turn. Also, need to avoid walls and body collisions.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cannot go to x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. Also internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nNow, from head (3,1), possible moves:\n\n- Up (U): (3,2) but (3,2) is occupied by snake body? Snake positions: (3,2) is index 7 in the list, which is a body segment. But when we move, the snake moves, so the tail moves away, but we need to see if (3,2) is safe to move to.\n\nGeneral rule: when moving, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves away, so the only body cell that might be occupied is if it's not the tail, but since tail moves, moving into the tail cell is safe, as long as no other body is there.\n\n\"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo collision if head touches any body segment except the tail, because tail moves.\n\nIn this case, from (3,1), moving:\n\n- U (up) to (3,2): what is at (3,2)? It's in snake positions: (3,2) is index 7. Now, is this the tail? Tail is (1,3), so (3,2) is not tail, it's a body segment. So if head moves to (3,2), it would collide with body at (3,2), since that cell is occupied and not the tail.\n\nAfter movement, the body shifts, but at the moment of movement, if head moves to a cell occupied by body, it collides, except if it's the tail cell.\n\nLet's clarify: when you move, the head goes to a new cell, then each segment moves to the next position, so the tail leaves its current cell.\n\nSo, for a cell to be safe to move to:\n\n- It must not be a wall\n\n- It must not be occupied by any body segment except possibly the tail; if it's the tail, it's ok because tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, from (3,1):\n\n- U to (3,2): (3,2) is occupied by body segment (index 7), and it's not the tail (tail is (1,3)), so moving there would cause collision. Unsafe.\n\n- D to (3,0): but y=0 is wall, so out of bounds or wall. y=0 is border, wall, so cannot move there. Unsafe.\n\n- L to (2,1): (2,1) is occupied by body segment (index 1), not tail, so collision. Also, cannot move opposite direction, but L is left, current direction R right, so opposite, cannot move left anyway.\n\nCurrent direction R, so cannot move L (opposite).\n\n- R to (4,1): now, (4,1) - is it occupied? Snake positions: let's see, (4,2) is there, but (4,1) is not listed, so probably empty. Walls: x=4 not wall except if y=0 or7, but y=1, not border. Internal obstacle at (4,6), not here. So (4,1) should be free.\n\nBut is (4,1) within bounds? x=4, y=1, x from 0-7, y from 0-7, y=1 is not y=0, so yes.\n\nNow, moving R to (4,1) seems possible.\n\nBut are there other options? Only R is possible? U and D and L are all unsafe or invalid.\n\nU: to (3,2) occupied, unsafe.\n\nD: to (3,0) wall, unsafe.\n\nL: opposite direction, invalid and also (2,1) occupied.\n\nR: to (4,1), which seems free.\n\nBut let's confirm snake positions: positions are: (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), etc. So (4,1) not occupied, and not wall.\n\nSo only possible move is R to (4,1).\n\nBut is that right? What about other directions? U, D, L not possible, so must move R.\n\nBut let's think: after moving, the snake will have head at (4,1), and the tail will move away from (1,3), so the body shifts.\n\nIn terms of immediate move, only R is safe.\n\nBut I need to think ahead for multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps I can move to other cells if I consider the tail movement, but in this position, from (3,1), only (4,1) is adjacent and free.\n\n(3,1) has neighbors:\n\n- Up: (3,2) - occupied by body\n\n- Down: (3,0) - wall\n\n- Left: (2,1) - occupied by body and opposite direction\n\n- Right: (4,1) - free\n\nSo indeed, only right is possible.\n\nSo for turn 78, action must be R.\n\nBut let's write it down.\n\nNow, after moving to (4,1), what is the new state?\n\nTurn 79: head at (4,1), direction R (since moved right).\n\nSnake positions: after moving right, head to (4,1), then the body: the segment that was at (3,1) moves to where? The snake moves: new head at (4,1), then the first body segment is the old head (3,1), but the positions shift.\n\nOriginal positions: index 0: (3,1) head, 1: (2,1), 2: (2,2), ..., up to 18: (1,3) tail.\n\nAfter moving R to (4,1), the new head is at (4,1). Then the body segments: the segment that was at index 0 moves to the new position? No: when snake moves, the head goes to new cell, then each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo new positions: head is new position (4,1). Then segment 1 (was at (2,1)) moves to where head was, (3,1)? No.\n\nStandard snake movement: the head moves to the new cell, then each subsequent segment moves to the cell where the previous segment was.\n\nSo:\n\n- New head: (4,1)  (from move)\n\n- Then the first body segment (index 1, was (2,1)) moves to the old head position (3,1)\n\n- Second body segment (index 2, was (2,2)) moves to the position of index 1, which is now (2,1)? Let's think in terms of the list.\n\nThe positions list shifts: the tail is removed, and new head is added.\n\nSpecifically: when moving, the tail cell is vacated, and the head moves to new cell.\n\nNew positions: [new_head] + positions[:-1] but positions[:-1] are all shifted.\n\nOriginal list: pos = [p0, p1, p2, ..., p18] with p0=head.\n\nAfter moving to new cell, new_head = (4,1)\n\nThen new positions: [new_head, p0, p1, p2, ..., p17]  because the tail p18 is removed.\n\np0 was (3,1), p1 was (2,1), ..., p17 was (1,4), p18 was (1,3) tail.\n\nAfter move: new_head = (4,1)\n\nThen new body: [p0, p1, p2, ..., p17] so [ (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4) ]\n\np17 was (1,4), and p18 tail is gone.\n\nSo new positions: head (4,1), then (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4)\n\nTail is now (1,4).\n\nDirection is now R, since moved right.\n\nNow, food: (3,6) life span was 2 at turn 78, after turn 78, it decreases, so at turn 79, life span is 1? Let's track food life span.\n\nAt turn 78:\n\n- (3,6): value 1, life span 2\n\n- (5,5): value 1, life span 5\n\n- (2,5): value 1, life span 8\n\nAfter turn 78 action, we are at turn 79.\n\nFood life span decreases after each turn, including when the turn is played.\n\nSo after turn 78 is played, life spans decrease.\n\nSo for (3,6): at turn 78, life span 2; after turn 78, it becomes 1.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) from 5 to 4, (2,5) from 8 to 7.\n\nThen at turn 79, we have the state.\n\nNow, for turn 79, head at (4,1), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R. But cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction R, so cannot move L (left).\n\nNow, from (4,1):\n\n- U to (4,2): (4,2) is occupied? New positions: (4,2) is in the list, index 9? New positions: head (4,1), then (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), etc. So (4,2) is the 10th segment? Let's index: position 0: (4,1) head, 1: (3,1), 2: (2,1), 3: (2,2), 4: (2,3), 5: (2,4), 6: (3,4), 7: (3,3), 8: (3,2), 9: (4,2), 10: (5,2), 11: (5,3), 12: (4,3), 13: (4,4), 14: (4,5), 15: (3,5), 16: (2,5), 17: (1,5), 18: (1,4) tail.\n\n(4,2) is position 9, which is a body segment, not tail (tail is (1,4)), so moving to (4,2) would collide. Unsafe.\n\n- D to (4,0): but y=0 is wall, unsafe.\n\n- L to (3,1): (3,1) is position 1, body segment, not tail, so collision. Also, opposite direction, invalid.\n\n- R to (5,1): (5,1) - is it free? Not in positions, not wall (x=5,y=1, not border, internal obstacle at (4,6), not here). So (5,1) should be free.\n\nSo only possible move is R to (5,1).\n\nAgain, only one choice?\n\nU to (4,2) occupied, D wall, L occupied and opposite, R free.\n\nSo move R to (5,1).\n\nThen turn 79 action R.\n\nNow, after that, turn 80.\n\nNew head: (5,1)\n\nNew positions: [ (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5) ] and tail (1,4) is gone, so last is (1,5)? Positions: new head (5,1), then old positions except last: so [ (5,1) ] + [ (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5) ] but (1,4) is removed, so body ends at (1,5).\n\nOriginal before move: positions up to (1,4) as tail? Earlier at turn 79 state: positions included (1,4) as tail.\n\nAt turn 79 after move: positions [ (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4) ] with (4,1) head, (1,4) tail.\n\nAfter moving R to (5,1): new head (5,1), new positions: [ (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5) ] and (1,4) is removed, so tail is now (1,5).\n\nDirection R.\n\nFood at turn 79: after turn 78, food life spans decreased.\n\nAt turn 78: food (3,6) span 2, (5,5) span 5, (2,5) span 8.\n\nAfter turn 78, spans: (3,6) span 1, (5,5) span 4, (2,5) span 7.\n\nAt turn 79, after action, spans decrease again? No, after each turn, meaning after the turn is completed.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt the start of turn t, we have the state, including food life spans.\n\nAfter we choose action and move, the turn is completed, then food life spans decrease.\n\nThen next turn begins.\n\nSo for turn t, we act based on current spans, then after action, spans decrease.\n\nIn this case, at turn 78, we acted with spans as given.\n\nAfter turn 78 action, spans decrease.\n\nThen turn 79 begins with decreased spans.\n\nSimilarly, after turn 79 action, spans decrease again.\n\nBack to turn 80.\n\nHead at (5,1), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R. Cannot move opposite, so cannot move L (left).\n\nFrom (5,1):\n\n- U to (5,2): (5,2) is occupied? Positions: (5,2) is index 10 in new list? New positions: 0: (5,1) head, 1: (4,1), 2: (3,1), 3: (2,1), 4: (2,2), 5: (2,3), 6: (2,4), 7: (3,4), 8: (3,3), 9: (3,2), 10: (4,2), 11: (5,2)? 11: (5,2) is position, but in list, index 11 is (5,2)? Let's list: positions: 0:(5,1), 1:(4,1), 2:(3,1), 3:(2,1), 4:(2,2), 5:(2,3), 6:(2,4), 7:(3,4), 8:(3,3), 9:(3,2), 10:(4,2), 11:(5,2), 12:(5,3), 13:(4,3), 14:(4,4), 15:(4,5), 16:(3,5), 17:(2,5), 18:(1,5) tail.\n\nSo (5,2) is index 11, body segment, not tail (tail is (1,5)), so moving to (5,2) would collide. Unsafe.\n\n- D to (5,0): wall, unsafe.\n\n- L to (4,1): (4,1) is position 1, body segment, not tail, collision. Also opposite direction, invalid.\n\n- R to (6,1): (6,1) - x=6, y=1, not wall (x=7 is wall, but x=6 is ok), not occupied? Not in positions, so free.\n\nSo move R to (6,1).\n\nTurn 80 action R.\n\nThis is going right along the bottom. But we need to think about food and long-term.\n\nFood is at (3,6), (5,5), (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is occupied by body? At current state, (2,5) is a body segment, index 16 or something, but food can be under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves there.\n\nAt turn 78, food at (2,5) with value 1, but (2,5) is occupied by snake body, index 15: (3,5), (2,5), etc., so (2,5) has food, but snake is on it, so it can't be eaten yet; the body must move away first.\n\nSimilarly, at (3,6), not occupied, free cell.\n\n(5,5) free.\n\nBut in our current path, we are moving right to (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), etc., away from the food.\n\nWe need to consider eating food.\n\nBut so far, from (3,1), only move was R, then R again, then R again, to (6,1).\n\nAt (6,1), direction R.\n\nTurn 81: head at (6,1), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R. Cannot move L (opposite).\n\nFrom (6,1):\n\n- U to (6,2): is (6,2) free? Not in positions, not wall, so probably free.\n\n- D to (6,0): wall, unsafe.\n\n- L to (5,1): (5,1) is position 1 now? After move to (6,1), positions: new head (6,1), then [ (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5) ] tail (1,5).\n\n(5,1) is index 1, body, not tail, so collision if move to (5,1). Also opposite, invalid.\n\n- R to (7,1): but x=7 is wall, border, so cannot move there. Unsafe.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (6,2) or D, but D wall, so only U to (6,2).\n\nD to (6,0) wall, so only U possible.\n\nMove U to (6,2).\n\nTurn 81 action U.\n\nDirection now U (up).\n\nThen turn 82: head at (6,2), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R. Cannot move opposite, so cannot move D (down).\n\nFrom (6,2):\n\n- U to (6,3): free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\n- D to (6,1): (6,1) is old position, but after move, it's not occupied anymore? At turn 81, after moving to (6,2), positions: new head (6,2), then [ (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) ] tail (2,5)? Positions: 0:(6,2), 1:(6,1), 2:(5,1), 3:(4,1), 4:(3,1), 5:(2,1), 6:(2,2), 7:(2,3), 8:(2,4), 9:(3,4), 10:(3,3), 11:(3,2), 12:(4,2), 13:(5,2), 14:(5,3), 15:(4,3), 16:(4,4), 17:(4,5), 18:(3,5) I think, let's not list all, but (6,1) is now body, index 1.\n\n(6,1) is body, not tail.\n\nMoving D to (6,1) would be collision, since it's occupied and not tail. Also, opposite direction.\n\n- L to (5,2): (5,2) is occupied? In positions, (5,2) is index 13, body segment.\n\n- R to (7,2): x=7 wall, unsafe.\n\n- U to (6,3): should be free.\n\nSo only U to (6,3) possible.\n\nMove U to (6,3).\n\nTurn 82 action U.\n\nBut we are moving up, and food is at y=5,6, so we need to head north.\n\nBut let's see the food life spans.\n\nFirst, at turn 78, we have food:\n\n(3,6) span 2: can be eaten turn 78 or 79\n\n(5,5) span 5: can be eaten turn 78 to 82\n\n(2,5) span 8: can be eaten turn 78 to 85\n\nAt turn 78, we moved R to (4,1), not eating any food.\n\nTurn 79: at (4,1), no food, moved R to (5,1)\n\nTurn 80: at (5,1), no food, moved R to (6,1)\n\nTurn 81: at (6,1), no food, moved U to (6,2)\n\nTurn 82: at (6,2), no food, moving U to (6,3)\n\n(3,6) at turn 78 span 2, after turn 78 span 1, after turn 79 span 0, disappears, so only available on turn 78 and 79, but we didn't go there, so it's gone.\n\n(5,5) span 5 at turn 78, after turn 78 span 4, turn 79 span 3, turn 80 span 2, turn 81 span 1, turn 82 span 0, disappears after turn 82.\n\nSo can be eaten up to turn 81.\n\nAt turn 81, we are at (6,1), moving to (6,2), not close to (5,5).\n\n(5,5) is at x=5,y=5, we are at (6,2), so not reachable in one move.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) is still there, span 8 at turn 78, after decreases, at turn 82, after turn 81, span? Turn 78 span 8, after 78:7, after 79:6, after 80:5, after 81:4, so at turn 82, span 4, still available.\n\nBut we are at (6,3) after turn 82, far from (2,5).\n\nWe need to think ahead from the beginning.\n\nAt turn 78, from (3,1), only move was R, but perhaps I missed something.\n\nAnother thing: the head is at (3,1), and there is food at (2,5), which is on the body, but since we move, the body might move away.\n\nAt turn 78, (2,5) has food, and it's a body segment.\n\nIf the snake moves in such a way that the body at (2,5) moves away, and then head can move to (2,5) to eat it.\n\nBut at turn 78, (2,5) is not the tail; tail is (1,3), so it might move away.\n\nBut from (3,1), we could only move R, so no choice.\n\nAfter moving R to (4,1), at turn 79, head at (4,1), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: only R to (5,1), as we did.\n\nBut let's see if we can move U or D, but earlier we saw U to (4,2) occupied, D wall, L invalid, so no.\n\nAt turn 80, (5,1), only R to (6,1).\n\nTurn 81, (6,1), only U to (6,2).\n\nTurn 82, (6,2), only U to (6,3).\n\nNow at (6,3), direction U.\n\nTurn 83: head at (6,3), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R. Cannot move D (opposite).\n\nFrom (6,3):\n\n- U to (6,4): free? Not wall, not occupied.\n\n- D to (6,2): (6,2) is position, after move to (6,3), positions: new head (6,3), then [ (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5) ] tail (3,5)? Approximately.\n\n(6,2) is body, so moving D to (6,2) collision.\n\n- L to (5,3): (5,3) is occupied? In positions, (5,3) is index 14 or something, body segment.\n\n- R to (7,3): wall, unsafe.\n\n- U to (6,4): free, so move U.\n\nSimilarly, we can keep moving up, but the grid is small, and we have internal wall at (4,6), but we are at x=6.\n\nBut we need to eat food; there is food at (2,5) with span left.\n\nAt turn 83, head at (6,3), move U to (6,4).\n\nTurn 84: at (6,4), move U to (6,5), if free.\n\n(6,5) not wall, not occupied yet.\n\nThen turn 85: at (6,5), move U to (6,6), but y=6, and internal obstacle at (4,6), but (6,6) is not (4,6), so free, but y=6 is not wall, y=7 is wall.\n\ny=0 to 7, so y=6 is ok.\n\nBut at (6,6), we can move to food or something.\n\nBut food at (5,5) is gone, (3,6) gone, only (2,5) left, but at (6,6), far from (2,5).\n\nAlso, the snake is long, 19 cells, so the area might be crowded.\n\nMoreover, there is a risk of collision.\n\nBut let's go back to the beginning.\n\nAt turn 78, from (3,1), only move was R, but perhaps I can consider that moving R is the only way, but then we are trapped in the bottom right.\n\nAnother thing: the head direction is R, but after moving, direction changes.\n\nBut in this case, we had no choice.\n\nPerhaps at some point, we can turn.\n\nFor example, at turn 81, from (6,1), we moved U to (6,2).\n\nFrom (6,1), could we move other? Only U possible.\n\nSimilarly later.\n\nBut let's list the actions so far:\n\nTurn 78: R to (4,1)\n\nTurn 79: R to (5,1)\n\nTurn 80: R to (6,1)\n\nTurn 81: U to (6,2)\n\nTurn 82: U to (6,3)\n\nTurn 83: U to (6,4)  (assuming)\n\nTurn 84: U to (6,5)\n\nAt (6,5), direction U.\n\nTurn 85: from (6,5), move U to (6,6)\n\nThen at (6,6), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,7): y=7 wall, unsafe.\n\nD to (6,5): occupied by body after move.\n\nL to (5,6): (5,6) - is it free? Not wall, but internal obstacle at (4,6), not (5,6), so free if not occupied.\n\nR to (7,6): x=7 wall, unsafe.\n\nSo from (6,6), can move L to (5,6) or D, but D opposite and occupied.\n\nMove L to (5,6).\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut no food, and (2,5) might be gone or not eaten.\n\n(2,5) food at turn 78 span 8, after decreases, at turn 85, after turn 84, span? Turn 78:8, 79:7, 80:6, 81:5, 82:4, 83:3, 84:2, after turn 84, span 1, then after turn 85, span 0, disappear. So can be eaten up to turn 84 or 85? At turn 85, if span >0 before decrease.\n\nAt start of turn t, span N, if N>0, can be eaten on turn t, then after turn, span decreases.\n\nSo for (2,5), span 8 at turn 78.\n\nTurn 78: can be eaten, span 8>0\n\nAfter turn 78, span 7\n\nTurn 79: span 7>0, can be eaten\n\n...\n\nTurn 84: span at start: after turn 83, span? Let's track:\n\nTurn 78 start: span 8\n\nAfter turn 78 action: span decreases to 7\n\nTurn 79 start: span 7\n\nAfter turn 79: span 6\n\n...\n\nAfter turn k, span decreases.\n\nAt turn t start, span S_t\n\nAfter action, span becomes S_t - 1 for next turn.\n\nFor (2,5), S_78 = 8\n\nAfter turn 78, S=7 for turn 79\n\nS_79=7, after turn 79, S=6 for turn 80\n\nS_80=6, after turn 80, S=5 for turn 81\n\nS_81=5, after turn 81, S=4 for turn 82\n\nS_82=4, after turn 82, S=3 for turn 83\n\nS_83=3, after turn 83, S=2 for turn 84\n\nS_84=2, after turn 84, S=1 for turn 85\n\nS_85=1, after turn 85, S=0, disappear.\n\nSo can be eaten on turn 85, since S_85=1>0.\n\nBut at turn 85, we are at (6,6) or something, far from (2,5).\n\nAlso, (2,5) is on the body, so we need to move the body away and head there.\n\nBut currently, the body is moving, so (2,5) might be vacated at some point.\n\nFor example, at turn 78, (2,5) is occupied.\n\nAs the snake moves, the tail moves, so positions change.\n\nIn our current path, we are moving away, so (2,5) might be vacated later.\n\nBut to eat it, we need to move the head to (2,5) when it's free.\n\nBut with the snake moving right and up, it's hard to reach (2,5).\n\nPerhaps at turn 78, there was no choice, but let's think if we could have moved differently earlier.\n\nAnother point: at turn 78, from (3,1), only R possible, but after that, at turn 79, from (4,1), we moved R, but could we have moved U or D? U to (4,2) was occupied, but (4,2) is a body segment, but it might be the tail or something, but in turn 79 state, (4,2) is not tail, tail is (1,4), so occupied.\n\nBut let's list the positions at turn 79: head (4,1), body includes (4,2) at index 9, which is not tail.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps we can consider that the snake can turn when possible.\n\nBut in this case, from the bottom, we have to move right until we can turn up.\n\nAt (6,1), we turned up to (6,2).\n\nThen we can continue up to (6,5) or (6,6), then left.\n\nBut there is food at (5,5), but it expired.\n\n(5,5) span at turn 78:5, after turn 78:4, turn 79:3, turn 80:2, turn 81:1, turn 82:0, so at turn 82, S_82=0? S_78=5, after 78:4 for 79, S_79=4, after 79:3 for 80, S_80=3, after 80:2 for 81, S_81=2, after 81:1 for 82, S_82=1, after turn 82, S=0, disappear. So can be eaten on turn 82, S_82=1>0.\n\nAt turn 82, we are at (6,2), moving to (6,3), not at (5,5).\n\n(5,5) is at x=5,y=5, we at (6,2), not adjacent.\n\nSo missed it.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) expired earlier.\n\nOnly (2,5) left, but we are far.\n\nTo maximize score, we need to eat the food, but we missed two, and the third is far.\n\nBut perhaps from the beginning, we could have chosen a different path, but at turn 78, only one move.\n\nUnless... is there a way to move to the food earlier?\n\nFor example, at turn 78, from (3,1), only R possible, but after that, at turn 79, from (4,1), only R possible.\n\nAt turn 80, from (5,1), only R possible.\n\nAt turn 81, from (6,1), only U possible.\n\nAt turn 82, from (6,2), only U possible.\n\nAt turn 83, from (6,3), we can move U to (6,4), or perhaps L or R, but R wall, L to (5,3) occupied.\n\n(5,3) is body, so no.\n\nAt (6,3), move U to (6,4).\n\nThen at (6,4), turn 84: head (6,4), direction U.\n\nMove U to (6,5) or D or L/R.\n\nD to (6,3) occupied and opposite.\n\nL to (5,4): (5,4) - is it free? Not in positions, not wall, so free.\n\nR to (7,4) wall.\n\nU to (6,5) free.\n\nSo we can move L to (5,4) or U to (6,5).\n\nFinally a choice!\n\nAt turn 84, from (6,4), we can go left to (5,4) or up to (6,5).\n\nIf we go U to (6,5), then to (6,6), then as before.\n\nIf we go L to (5,4), then we can head towards the center.\n\nBut food at (2,5) can be eaten until turn 85.\n\nAt turn 84, S_84 for (2,5): earlier, S_84=2, so can be eaten on turn 84 or 85.\n\nAt turn 84, head at (6,4), if we move L to (5,4), then from (5,4), we can move to (5,5) but (5,5) food is gone, expired at turn 82.\n\n(5,5) gone.\n\n(2,5) is at (2,5).\n\nFrom (5,4), to (2,5) is not close.\n\nPositions: (5,4) to (2,5) is distance |5-2| + |4-5| = 3+1=4, so at least 4 moves away, but at turn 84, we move to (5,4), then turn 85 to somewhere, but (2,5) can be eaten on turn 85 if we reach it.\n\nBut from (5,4), to (2,5), we need to go left and up.\n\nBut the snake body might be in the way.\n\nMoreover, at turn 84, the body positions include cells around.\n\nTo eat (2,5), it must be free, and head move there.\n\nCurrently, (2,5) is a body segment? Let's see the snake position over turns.\n\nAt turn 78, (2,5) is occupied.\n\nAs we move right, the snake is stretching, so (2,5) might move or stay.\n\nAt turn 78, positions include (2,5) as index 15 or something.\n\nAfter moving right, at turn 79, positions include (2,5) still, index 16 or 17.\n\nAt turn 80, (2,5) is still there.\n\nEventually, as the tail moves, (2,5) will be vacated.\n\nFor example, at turn 78, tail is (1,3)\n\nAfter move R, turn 79, tail is (1,4)\n\nTurn 80, tail (1,5)\n\nTurn 81, after moving U to (6,2), tail is (2,5)? At turn 81 state: after move to (6,2), positions include up to (2,5) as tail or body.\n\nAt turn 81, head (6,2), body includes (2,5) as index 17 or something, not tail, tail is (1,5) at that time? Earlier calculation.\n\nPerhaps it's better to simulate the tail movement.\n\nSince the snake is moving right and up, the left part is moving towards the tail.\n\nAt some point, (2,5) will be the tail or vacated.\n\nFor example, at turn 78, (2,5) is index 15 in the list.\n\nThe tail is index 18, (1,3).\n\nAfter each move, the tail index decreases.\n\nAfter turn 78 move, positions 19 segments, tail at (1,4)\n\nTurn 79 move, positions 19 segments, tail at (1,5)\n\nTurn 80 move, positions 19, tail at (2,5)? Let's see:\n\nAt turn 80 after move to (6,1), positions: [ (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) ] so tail is (2,5)\n\nAt turn 80, tail is (2,5), which has food.\n\nBut we cannot eat it yet because the head is not adjacent, and the food is under the tail.\n\nSpecial rule: if head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because the head and newly grown tail collide.\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nAt turn 80, head at (6,1), tail at (2,5), not adjacent, so no danger.\n\nBut to eat the food at (2,5), we need the body to move away first, but at turn 80, (2,5) is the tail, so if the tail moves away, the cell is vacated, then head can move there.\n\nAt turn 80, after move, tail is at (2,5), with food.\n\nOn turn 81, we move head to (6,2), then tail moves from (2,5) to the previous position, which is (1,5)? In the positions, before move, tail at (2,5), after move, the segment that was before tail moves to tail position or something.\n\nAt turn 80 state, positions: head (6,1), then ... , second last (3,5), last tail (2,5)\n\nWhen we move to (6,2), new head (6,2), then the body shifts, so the new tail is the cell that was second last, (3,5), and (2,5) is vacated.\n\nSo after turn 81 action, (2,5) is free, with food.\n\nThen at turn 81, head at (6,2), food at (2,5) is free, but far.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 82, etc.\n\nBut to eat it, we need to go to (2,5), but we are at (6,2), too far, and with the snake long, it's risky to turn back.\n\nMoreover, there might be walls or body in the way.\n\nFor example, from (6,2) to (2,5), we need to go left and up, but the body is between, so likely collision.\n\nFor instance, at turn 81, positions include cells like (5,2), (4,2), etc., so the area is occupied.\n\nSo it's not feasible to go back to (2,5) in time.\n\nTherefore, in this path, we miss all food.\n\nBut at turn 83 or 84, we have a choice to go left.\n\nLet's go back to turn 83.\n\nAt turn 83, head at (6,3), direction U.\n\nWe can move U to (6,4), or since we can move L or R, but R wall, L to (5,3) occupied, so only U.\n\nTurn 84: head at (6,4), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,5), D to (6,3), L to (5,4), R to (7,4) wall.\n\nD is opposite and occupied, so invalid.\n\nR wall.\n\nSo U to (6,5) or L to (5,4).\n\nNow, (5,4) is free, as not in positions.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) free.\n\nIf we move L to (5,4), then direction changes to L (left).\n\nThen at turn 85, from (5,4), direction L.\n\nCan move U to (5,5), but (5,5) food gone.\n\nD to (5,3), occupied? At turn 84, after moving to (5,4), positions: new head (5,4), then [ (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) ] or something, but (5,3) is body, so moving D to (5,3) collision.\n\nL to (4,4): (4,4) is occupied? In positions, (4,4) is body.\n\nR to (6,4): occupied by body after move.\n\nU to (5,5): free, but no food.\n\nSo from (5,4), move U to (5,5).\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut no food eaten.\n\nIf at turn 84, we move U to (6,5), then at (6,5), direction U.\n\nTurn 85: move U to (6,6) or L to (5,5) or D or R.\n\nD opposite, occupied.\n\nR wall.\n\nU to (6,6) or L to (5,5).\n\nMove L to (5,5) or U to (6,6).\n\n(5,5) has no food.\n\nThen same.\n\nSo in all cases, we don't eat any food in the next few turns.\n\nBut to maximize score, we should try to eat when possible.\n\nAt turn 78, we had to move R, but perhaps later we can eat other food.\n\nBut the only food left is (2,5), which is difficult.\n\nPerhaps there is a better way from the start.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 78, from (3,1), only R possible, but after moving to (4,1), at turn 79, we are at (4,1), and there is food at (5,5) with span 4 left (after turn 78 decrease).\n\nFrom (4,1), we moved R to (5,1), but at (5,1), we are closer to (5,5).\n\nAt turn 79, head at (4,1), we moved R to (5,1), but could we have moved other? No, only R possible.\n\nThen at turn 80, at (5,1), we moved R to (6,1), but from (5,1), we could only move R or U, but U to (5,2) occupied, so only R.\n\nAt turn 81, at (6,1), we moved U to (6,2), but from (6,1), we could move U to (6,2), which is free, but if we could move L, but L opposite and occupied.\n\nSo no choice.\n\nTherefore, in this situation, the snake is forced to move right and up, missing the food, and we need to continue for survival.\n\nBut for the answer, we need to provide actions for turn 78 and ahead, but the format is to provide for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't specify how many turns, so perhaps for the next 5 turns or so.\n\nBut let's see the core rules: \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so for the answer, we can provide a sequence.\n\nBut in this case, from turn 78, we have:\n\nTurn 78: R (only choice)\n\nTurn 79: R (only)\n\nTurn 80: R (only)\n\nTurn 81: U (only)\n\nTurn 82: U (only)\n\nAt turn 83, from (6,3), move U to (6,4)\n\nTurn 84: from (6,4), we have a choice: U or L.\n\nTo maximize long-term, moving L might open more space, but since no food, it doesn't matter for score, but for survival, we need to avoid dead ends.\n\nFor example, if we move U to (6,5), then at (6,5), we can move U to (6,6) or L to (5,5).\n\nThen at (6,6), we can move L to (5,6) or D, but D occupied.\n\nThen to (5,6), then to (5,7) or (4,6), but (4,6) is internal obstacle, so cannot move there.\n\n(4,6) is wall, so from (5,6), move U to (5,7) or L to (4,6) wall or R to (6,6) occupied or D to (5,5).\n\nSo possible U or D.\n\nBut y=7 is wall, so U to (5,7) not possible, y=7 wall.\n\nSo from (5,6), can move D to (5,5) or L to (4,6) wall or R or U wall, so only D to (5,5).\n\nThen back.\n\nSimilarly, if we move L at turn 84 to (5,4), then to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut to provide the answer, since at turn 84 we have a choice, but for earlier turns, no choice.\n\nFor the sequence, from turn 78 to 82, only one way.\n\nThen for turn 83, move U to (6,4)\n\nTurn 84, let's say move U to (6,5) for consistency.\n\nThen turn 85: from (6,5), move U to (6,6) or L to (5,5), say U to (6,6)\n\nBut we need to output for turn 78 and ahead.\n\nPerhaps output for 5 turns: turn 78 to 82.\n\nBut let's confirm the state.\n\nCurrent turn t1=78.\n\nAnswer format: for turn 78, action; turn 79, action; etc.\n\nSince at turn 78, only R possible, and so on.\n\nBut let's double-check if at turn 78, we can move other.\n\nHead at (3,1), direction R.\n\nU to (3,2): occupied by body at (3,2)\n\nD to (3,0): wall\n\nL to (2,1): occupied by body at (2,1) and opposite direction\n\nR to (4,1): free\n\nSo only R.\n\nSimilarly, after that, only one choice each turn until turn 82.\n\nAt turn 83, from (6,3), only U possible.\n\nThen at turn 84, from (6,4), we can choose U or L.\n\nBut for the answer, we can provide the actions.\n\nSince the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but for output, it might be for a few turns.\n\nPerhaps we should include until we have a choice.\n\nBut to be safe, let's provide for turn 78 to 82, all determined.\n\nTurn 78: R\n\nTurn 79: R\n\nTurn 80: R\n\nTurn 81: U\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nThen for turn 83, it would be U, but not included.\n\nIn the output format, it says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so we need to specify how many, but it doesn't say, so perhaps for the immediate actions where there is choice, but here no choice.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (2,5) might be eatable if we can reach it, but we can't in this path.\n\nSo I think for the answer, we provide the sequence as above.\n\nSo for turn 78: R\n\nTurn 79: R\n\nTurn 80: R\n\nTurn 81: U\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nAnd for later, not included.\n\nBut in the box, we need to write it.\n\nPerhaps we can write for 5 turns.\n\nBut at turn 83, it is also determined if we move U.\n\nBut let's see the life span of food.\n\n(2,5) can be eaten until turn 85, but we are not going there.\n\nI think we have to accept that.\n\nSo the actions:\n\nTurn 78: R\n\nTurn 79: R\n\nTurn 80: R\n\nTurn 81: U\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nNow for the answer format.\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 78: R Turn 79: R Turn 80: R Turn 81: U Turn 82: U }\n\nBut it says \"action on turn t1\", etc., and action like \"U (up)\" or just \"U\"?\n\nIn the format, it says \"action \\in {U (up), D (down), L (left), R (right)}\", so we can use the letter.\n\nAlso, in the box.\n\nBut to be clear.\n\nPerhaps we should include turn 83, but not necessary.\n\nSince at turn 84 there is choice, but for now, up to turn 82.\n\nI think it's fine.\n</think>\nBased on the current state at turn 78, the snake must prioritize survival while considering opportunities to eat food. The only safe move from position (3,1) with direction R is right (R) to (4,1), as other directions lead to collisions or walls. Subsequent turns are similarly constrained by the snake's body positions and walls, leaving only one safe move each turn until turn 83.\n\n- **Turn 78**: From (3,1), moving up to (3,2) collides with body, down to (3,0) is a wall, left to (2,1) collides with body and is opposite to current direction (invalid). Only right to (4,1) is safe.\n- **Turn 79**: From (4,1), moving up to (4,2) collides with body, down to (4,0) is a wall, left to (3,1) collides with body and is opposite. Only right to (5,1) is safe.\n- **Turn 80**: From (5,1), moving up to (5,2) collides with body, down to (5,0) is a wall, left to (4,1) collides with body and is opposite. Only right to (6,1) is safe.\n- **Turn 81**: From (6,1), moving down to (6,0) is a wall, left to (5,1) collides with body and is opposite, right to (7,1) is a wall. Only up to (6,2) is safe.\n- **Turn 82**: From (6,2), moving down to (6,1) collides with body and is opposite, left to (5,2) collides with body, right to (7,2) is a wall. Only up to (6,3) is safe.\n\nLooking ahead 5+ turns, the food at (3,6) expires after turn 79 and is unreachable. The food at (5,5) expires after turn 82 and is also unreachable given the snake's path. The food at (2,5) is on the body and requires the head to move there after it becomes free, but the snake's position at (6,3) on turn 82 is too far, and moving back risks collision. Thus, no food can be eaten in this sequence, but survival is ensured.\n\nThe sequence for turns 78 to 82 is deterministic due to movement constraints.\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 78: R Turn 79: R Turn 80: R Turn 81: U Turn 82: U }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. The current turn is 79. The grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls, and there's an internal obstacle at (4,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders and (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (4,1), and the direction is right (R). The positions are given as a list: [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4)]. Let me list these out to understand the snake's shape.\n\nThe snake has 19 segments. Head at (4,1), then (3,1), (2,1), then up to (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), then right to (3,4), down to (3,3), left? (3,3) to (3,2), then right to (4,2), up to (5,2)? (5,2) is right from (4,2) since x increases right. Grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, I assume y=0 is bottom or top? Typically in grids, y=0 might be top or bottom, but here positions like (4,1) and (3,1) suggest y=1 is a row, and moving up/down changes y.\n\nIn movement, U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so y increases up, y decreases down. So y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? Let's see the positions.\n\nHead at (4,1), direction R. Then (3,1) is left of head, so moving right from (3,1) to (4,1). Positions: (4,1) head, (3,1), (2,1), then (2,2) which is up from (2,1) since y=2 > y=1, so up. Then (2,3) up, (2,4) up, then (3,4) which is right from (2,4), then (3,3) down from (3,4) since y=3<4, then (3,2) down, then (4,2) right from (3,2), then (5,2) right, then (5,3) up, then (4,3) left, then (4,4) up, then (4,5) up, then (3,5) left, then (2,5) left, then (1,5) left, then (1,4) down.\n\nSo the snake is long and twisted.\n\nNow, food items:\n\n- (3,6) with value 1, life_span 1\n\n- (5,5) with value 1, life_span 4\n\n- (2,5) with value 1, life_span 7\n\n- (1,1) with value 1, life_span 10\n\nAll food has value 1, so all positive food. No negative food here.\n\nLife_span: for (3,6) it's 1, meaning it disappears after this turn or next? Life_span decreases every turn, including current. So on turn 79, life_span=1, after this turn, it might disappear if we don't eat it now? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Life-span Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for a food with life_span N, it appears for N turns, including the turn it's spawned. On the turn it's spawned, life_span=N, then next turn N-1, down to 0, and when life_span=0, it disappears before the next turn or after? Typically, it should be available until life_span reaches 0.\n\nThe rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\".\n\nI think \"after N turns\" means it lasts for N full turns. For example, if spawned at turn t with life_span N, it is present from turn t to turn t + N - 1, and disappears at turn t + N.\n\nBut it says \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so on the turn it spawns, life_span=N, then on next turn life_span=N-1, ..., on turn when life_span=1, it decreases to 0 and disappears.\n\nLet's read carefully: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo for food at (3,6) with life_span=1 on turn 79, that means on turn 79, it has life_span=1, and after this turn, it decreases to 0 and disappears. So if we don't eat it on turn 79, it will be gone.\n\nSimilarly, for others: (5,5) life_span=4, so it will last 4 more turns including this one? On turn 79, life_span=4, then turn 80:3, 81:2, 82:1, and disappear on turn 83 or after turn 82?\n\nSince it decreases every turn including current, on turn t, life_span = remaining turns including current.\n\nSo for (3,6) on turn 79, life_span=1, so it must be eaten on this turn or it disappears.\n\n(5,5) life_span=4, so available until turn 79+3=82? Let's define.\n\nAt the start of turn t, if food has life_span L, it is present during turn t, and at the end of turn t, life_span decreases by 1. If after decrease, life_span=0, it disappears before the next turn.\n\nSo for (3,6): life_span=1 on turn 79, so during turn 79, it is present. After turn 79, life_span decreases to 0, so it disappears and not present on turn 80.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) life_span=4 on turn 79, present on turns 79,80,81,82. After turn 82, life_span=0, gone on turn 83.\n\n(2,5) life_span=7, present from 79 to 85? Turn 79:7, after decrease to 6 for turn 80, ..., after turn 85, life_span=0 after decrease? Turn 79: life_span=7, after turn 79:6, turn 80:6 present, after turn 80:5, ..., turn 85: life_span=1 present, after turn 85:0, gone on turn 86.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) life_span=10, present from turn 79 to 88.\n\nNow, snake head at (4,1), direction R, so last move was to the right to (4,1) from (3,1).\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R. But cannot move opposite to current direction, so cannot move left (L) because current direction is R, opposite is L, so illegal. Can move U, D, R.\n\nCurrent head (4,1), possible moves:\n\n- U: (4,2)\n\n- D: (4,0) but y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n\n- L: (3,1) but that's the body, and also opposite direction, illegal.\n\n- R: (5,1)\n\nBut (4,0) is wall, so D is invalid. L is illegal and body. So only U and R possible? U to (4,2), R to (5,1).\n\nNow, (4,2) is part of snake body? Look at positions: snake has (4,2) in the list? Positions: ... (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), ... so (4,2) is occupied by body segment. But when we move, the snake moves, so the tail moves, so (4,2) might be free after move? Need to think about movement.\n\nWhen snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to next position, tail leaves its position.\n\nSo on this turn, turn 79, if we move, head moves to new cell, body follows, tail leaves (1,4).\n\nSo the cell that was tail is now empty, but other body cells are still occupied until the snake moves.\n\nSpecifically, for a cell to be free, it must not be occupied by any body segment after the move.\n\nBut when considering if a move is valid, we need to check if the new head position is not a wall and not occupied by any body segment except possibly the tail, because the tail will move.\n\nCollision rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, moving to a cell that will be the tail after move is safe, because tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, current tail is at (1,4). If we move, the new head position should not be wall or any body except tail.\n\nNow, for move to (4,2): is (4,2) occupied? Current positions: (4,2) is in the list, it's a body segment. Is it the tail? Tail is (1,4), so (4,2) is not tail, it's a body segment, so moving there would cause collision.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1): is it occupied? Positions: (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), etc., (5,1) not in list, and not wall, so should be free? Walls: x=0,7 or y=0,7 walls, so (5,1) is within 1 to 6 in x? x=5, y=1, x=5 not 0 or 7, y=1 not 0 or 7, so not border wall. Internal obstacle (4,6), not (5,1). So (5,1) should be empty.\n\nBut is it possible that food is there? Food is at (3,6), (5,5), (2,5), (1,1), not (5,1), so empty.\n\nSimilarly, (4,2) is occupied by body, not tail.\n\nWhat about other directions? D to (4,0) is wall, invalid. L to (3,1) is body and illegal direction. So only possible moves: U to (4,2) or R to (5,1).\n\nBut U to (4,2): (4,2) is occupied by body segment. After move, if we move U, head goes to (4,2), but (4,2) is currently occupied by a segment that will move to the next position. When head moves to (4,2), the segment that was at (4,2) will move to where the head was or something? Let's think carefully.\n\nWhen the snake moves:\n\n- The head moves to the new cell.\n\n- Then each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n\n- The tail segment leaves, so that cell is free.\n\nSpecifically, if we move to a new cell, that cell must not be occupied by any part of the body except the tail cell, because the tail will move away.\n\nIn this case, current body positions: let's list all: indices 0 to 18: head (4,1), then (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), tail (1,4).\n\nNow, (4,2) is position of segment 9? Let's count: index 0: (4,1), 1: (3,1), 2: (2,1), 3: (2,2), 4: (2,3), 5: (2,4), 6: (3,4), 7: (3,3), 8: (3,2), 9: (4,2), 10: (5,2), 11: (5,3), 12: (4,3), 13: (4,4), 14: (4,5), 15: (3,5), 16: (2,5), 17: (1,5), 18: (1,4) tail.\n\nSo (4,2) is occupied by segment 9.\n\nIf we move U to (4,2), the head would move to (4,2), but (4,2) is currently occupied, so when head moves there, it would collide with the body segment there, unless that segment is the tail, which it's not.\n\nAfter the move, the segment that was at (4,2) will move to the position of segment 8 or something? The body segments shift.\n\nWhen head moves to a new cell, say new_head_pos.\n\nThen the new body positions: the first body segment moves to where head was, second to where first was, and so on, tail leaves.\n\nSo for a cell to be safe for head to move to, it must not be occupied by any body segment except the current tail, because the tail will move away, so that cell becomes free after move.\n\nIn this case, current tail is (1,4). So moving to (1,4) would be safe, but (1,4) is not adjacent to head? Head at (4,1), (1,4) is not adjacent.\n\nFor U to (4,2): (4,2) is occupied by segment 9, which is not tail, so it will be a body segment that doesn't move away immediately; when head moves to (4,2), segment 9 is still there until the move, but during the move, when head occupies (4,2), segment 9 is also there for a moment, causing collision.\n\nGenerally, it's a collision if the new head position is the same as any body segment position except the tail.\n\nSo here, (4,2) is occupied by a non-tail segment, so moving there causes collision.\n\nSimilarly, R to (5,1): (5,1) is not in the positions list, so empty, so safe.\n\nD to (4,0) wall, invalid.\n\nL to (3,1) occupied by segment 1, not tail, and illegal direction.\n\nSo only possible move is R to (5,1).\n\nBut is that right? What about moving up? U is to (4,2), which is occupied, but is there a way?\n\nPerhaps I missed something. Head at (4,1), U is (4,2), which is body, but after move, if we move U, the snake head goes to (4,2), but since (4,2) was body, and now it's head, but the segment that was at (4,2) moves to where the head was, (4,1), so it might be ok? No.\n\nLet's think: before move, positions: head (4,1), then body segments at (3,1), (2,1), ..., up to tail (1,4).\n\nIf we move head to (4,2), which is currently occupied by segment 9.\n\nAfter move:\n\n- New head at (4,2)\n\n- The segment that was at position 0 (head) is now at (4,2), but it's the head now.\n\n- Then the body segment that was at index 1 moves to where index 0 was, which is (4,1)\n\n- Index 2 moves to where index 1 was, (3,1)\n\n- ...\n- Index 9 was at (4,2), but now that position is taken by new head, so index 9 must move to where index 8 was, which is (3,2)\n\n- Similarly, index 10 moves to where index 9 was, but index 9 was at (4,2), which is now head, so it moves to (4,2)? Confusion.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, the first body segment (adjacent to head) moves to the old head position, the next moves to the old first body position, and so on, tail leaves.\n\nSo the cell that the head moves to must be empty or the tail cell.\n\nIf it's the tail cell, it's ok because tail moves away.\n\nIf it's a body cell, it causes collision because the body segment is still there when head arrives.\n\nIn this case, for (4,2), it is a body cell (segment 9), not tail, so moving there would cause head to collide with that segment.\n\nTherefore, moving U to (4,2) is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, only R to (5,1) is valid? But (5,1) is empty, as per positions.\n\nIs (5,1) within bounds? x=5, y=1, x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, x=5 not 0 or 7, y=1 not 0 or 7, and no internal wall, so yes.\n\nAlso, no food there, so empty.\n\nSo for turn 79, the only possible move is R to (5,1).\n\nBut let's confirm: current direction R, so moving R is allowed, not opposite.\n\nU is up, which is perpendicular, allowed.\n\nD down, invalid wall.\n\nL left, opposite, illegal.\n\nU to (4,2) occupied, invalid.\n\nSo only R to (5,1).\n\nBut that seems limiting. Perhaps I should check if (4,2) is really occupied or not.\n\nPositions: (4,2) is in the list as segment 9, so yes.\n\nUnless the snake is moving in a way that it can go there, but no, it would collide.\n\nAnother thing: food can spawn under body, but here (4,2) is not food, it's body.\n\nSo for turn 79, only possible action is R to (5,1).\n\nThen, after that, we need to plan multiple turns.\n\nThe answer should be a sequence of actions for turn 79 and future turns.\n\nBut we don't know future food, but we have current food with life spans.\n\nAlso, we need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nFirst, on turn 79, move R to (5,1).\n\nThen new head position (5,1), new direction R.\n\nNew snake positions: head at (5,1), then the previous head (4,1) becomes first body, so positions: new head (5,1), then (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), and tail was (1,4), but it moves away, so tail is now at (1,5)? Let's see: the segment that was at index 1 moves to index 0 position, etc.\n\nAfter moving to (5,1):\n\n- New positions: head at (5,1)\n\n- Body: segment that was at index 0 (old head) now at index 1: (4,1)\n\n- Index 1 old was (3,1) now at index 2: (3,1)? No.\n\nThe body segments shift down.\n\nNew position list:\n\n- Index 0: new head (5,1)\n\n- Index 1: where old head was, (4,1)\n\n- Index 2: where old index 1 was, (3,1)\n\n- Index 3: where old index 2 was, (2,1)\n\n- Index 4: where old index 3 was, (2,2)\n\n- Index 5: where old index 4 was, (2,3)\n\n- Index 6: where old index 5 was, (2,4)\n\n- Index 7: where old index 6 was, (3,4)\n\n- Index 8: where old index 7 was, (3,3)\n\n- Index 9: where old index 8 was, (3,2)\n\n- Index 10: where old index 9 was, (4,2)  // old index 9 was at (4,2), but now index 10 is at (4,2)? Old index 9 was (4,2), and it moves to where old index 8 was, which is (3,2)? Let's list old positions with indices.\n\nOld positions turn 79:\n\nIdx: 0: (4,1) head\n\n1: (3,1)\n\n2: (2,1)\n\n3: (2,2)\n\n4: (2,3)\n\n5: (2,4)\n\n6: (3,4)\n\n7: (3,3)\n\n8: (3,2)\n\n9: (4,2)\n\n10: (5,2)\n\n11: (5,3)\n\n12: (4,3)\n\n13: (4,4)\n\n14: (4,5)\n\n15: (3,5)\n\n16: (2,5)\n\n17: (1,5)\n\n18: (1,4) tail\n\nAfter move R to (5,1):\n\nNew head at (5,1)\n\nThen new body:\n\n- Index 1: old head position, (4,1)\n\n- Index 2: old index 1 position, (3,1)\n\n- Index 3: old index 2 position, (2,1)\n\n- Index 4: old index 3 position, (2,2)\n\n- Index 5: old index 4 position, (2,3)\n\n- Index 6: old index 5 position, (2,4)\n\n- Index 7: old index 6 position, (3,4)\n\n- Index 8: old index 7 position, (3,3)\n\n- Index 9: old index 8 position, (3,2)\n\n- Index 10: old index 9 position, (4,2)\n\n- Index 11: old index 10 position, (5,2)\n\n- Index 12: old index 11 position, (5,3)\n\n- Index 13: old index 12 position, (4,3)\n\n- Index 14: old index 13 position, (4,4)\n\n- Index 15: old index 14 position, (4,5)\n\n- Index 16: old index 15 position, (3,5)\n\n- Index 17: old index 16 position, (2,5)\n\n- Index 18: old index 17 position, (1,5)  // tail now, since old tail (1,4) is gone.\n\nOld tail (1,4) is not included, so the snake has 19 segments still, no food eaten, so length same.\n\nNew positions: head (5,1), then (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5) tail.\n\nTail at (1,5).\n\nNow, food: (3,6) life_span=1, must be eaten this turn or gone. But we moved to (5,1), not eating any food.\n\n(3,6) is at (3,6), we are at (5,1), far away, so we didn't eat it, and after this turn, it disappears.\n\n(5,5) is at (5,5), value 1, life_span now 3? After turn 79, life_span decreases to 3 for (5,5)? Turn 79: life_span=4, after turn 79, it decreases to 3 for turn 80.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) was 7, after turn 79, 6 for turn 80.\n\n(1,1) was 10, after turn 79, 9 for turn 80.\n\nAnd (3,6) gone.\n\nNow, for turn 80, head at (5,1), direction R (since we moved right).\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut cannot move opposite, current direction R, so cannot move L.\n\nU: (5,2)\n\nD: (5,0) wall, invalid\n\nL: (4,1) but occupied by body? (4,1) is new body segment, index 1, not tail.\n\nR: (6,1)\n\nNow, (5,2): is it occupied? New positions: (5,2) is index 11, body segment.\n\nNot tail, tail is (1,5).\n\nSo moving to (5,2) would collide.\n\n(6,1): is it wall or occupied? x=6, y=1, not border wall (x=0,7 walls, so x=6 ok, y=1 ok), no internal wall, not in positions, so empty.\n\nL to (4,1): occupied by index 1, not tail, and illegal direction? Current direction R, opposite L, so cannot move L anyway.\n\nD invalid.\n\nSo only possible moves: U to (5,2) or R to (6,1).\n\nBut U to (5,2) is occupied by body, so invalid? (5,2) is index 11, body, not tail.\n\nSo only R to (6,1) possible.\n\nThen turn 80: move R to (6,1).\n\nNew head (6,1), direction R.\n\nNew positions: head (6,1), then (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), tail (1,5) moves to where old index 17 was? Old index 17 was (2,5), so new tail at (2,5)? Let's not list all, it's tedious.\n\nAfter this, we might be stuck moving right, but x=6, if we go right to (7,1), x=7 is wall, invalid.\n\nSo on turn 81, head at (6,1), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U (6,2), D (6,0) wall, L (5,1) body and opposite, R (7,1) wall.\n\nSo U to (6,2) or D invalid, L illegal, R wall.\n\n(6,2): is it occupied? Current positions before move: head (6,1), body (5,1), etc. (6,2) not in positions, so empty? Positions have (5,3), (4,3), etc., not (6,2), so should be empty.\n\nSimilarly, no wall.\n\nSo move U to (6,2).\n\nThen turn 81: U to (6,2)\n\nDirection now U.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut we need to plan to eat food.\n\nAvailable food: (5,5) at (5,5) with life_span 3 on turn 80? After turn 79, (5,5) life_span=3 for turn 80.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) life_span=6 for turn 80, (1,1) life_span=9 for turn 80.\n\n(3,6) gone.\n\nWe are at (6,1) on turn 80 after move, but let's timeline.\n\nTurn 79: move R to (5,1), head to (5,1)\n\nTurn 80: move R to (6,1), head to (6,1)\n\nTurn 81: move U to (6,2), head to (6,2)\n\nNow at (6,2), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U (6,3), D (6,1) body and opposite, L (5,2), R (7,2) wall.\n\nD to (6,1) is where body is, and opposite direction, so invalid.\n\nR to (7,2) x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nL to (5,2): is (5,2) occupied? Current positions: before move turn 81, head at (6,1), body includes (5,1), (4,1), ..., (5,2) is a body segment, not tail.\n\nAfter turn 80 move to (6,1), positions: head (6,1), then (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), tail (1,5) or after turn 80 move, tail is at (2,5) or something.\n\nAfter turn 80 move R to (6,1):\n\nOld head (5,1), moved to (6,1)\n\nNew body: (5,1), then where old index 1 was (4,1), etc., down to where old index 17 was (2,5), and old tail (1,5) gone, so new tail at (2,5)? Let's: new positions after turn 80:\n\n- Head (6,1)\n\n- Then old head (5,1)\n\n- Old index 1 (4,1)\n\n- Old index 2 (3,1)\n\n- Old index 3 (2,1)\n\n- Old index 4 (2,2)\n\n- Old index 5 (2,3)\n\n- Old index 6 (2,4)\n\n- Old index 7 (3,4)\n\n- Old index 8 (3,3)\n\n- Old index 9 (3,2)\n\n- Old index 10 (4,2)\n\n- Old index 11 (5,2)\n\n- Old index 12 (5,3)\n\n- Old index 13 (4,3)\n\n- Old index 14 (4,4)\n\n- Old index 15 (4,5)\n\n- Old index 16 (3,5)\n\n- Old index 17 (2,5)  // new tail\n\nSo tail at (2,5)\n\nNow for turn 81, at (6,1), move U to (6,2)\n\n(6,2) is empty, not occupied.\n\nAfter move, new head (6,2), direction U.\n\nNew positions: head (6,2), then (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), tail (2,5) or new tail at old index 17 (2,5)? Old index 17 was (2,5), so new tail at (2,5).\n\nNow, from (6,2), we can go to (5,5) which is at (5,5).\n\n(5,5) is north-west from here? (6,2) to (5,5) is left and up.\n\nBut we need to move carefully.\n\nAlso, there is food at (2,5) and (1,1).\n\n(2,5) is currently occupied by tail, but food is at (2,5)? Food at (2,5) with value 1, but (2,5) is tail position, so the food is under the tail.\n\nRule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nAlso, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, for (2,5), food is there, but it's under the tail.\n\nTo eat it, the tail must move away, then head move to it.\n\nBut life_span is 6 after turn 79, so for turn 80:6, turn 81:5, etc., so it has time.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) is at (1,1), which might be accessible.\n\nBut let's focus on short term.\n\nOn turn 81, head at (6,2), direction U.\n\nPossible moves for turn 81: U to (6,3), D to (6,1) which is body and opposite, invalid, L to (5,2), R to (7,2) wall.\n\nD invalid, R invalid.\n\nU to (6,3): empty? Not in positions, no wall, so yes.\n\nL to (5,2): (5,2) is occupied by body? Current positions before move: (5,2) is index 11 or something, body segment, not tail.\n\nAfter turn 81 move to (6,2), positions include (5,2) as a body segment.\n\nSo moving to (5,2) would collide.\n\nSo only U to (6,3) possible.\n\nMove U to (6,3).\n\nThen turn 82, head at (6,3), direction U.\n\nSimilarly, only U or L or R, but D opposite invalid.\n\nU to (6,4), L to (5,3), R to (7,3) wall.\n\n(5,3) occupied? Positions have (5,3) as body, so only U to (6,4) or R invalid, so U.\n\nThis is going up the right wall.\n\nAt (6,4), then U to (6,5), and so on, up to (6,6), but y=6, and there is internal wall at (4,6), but (4,6) is different.\n\n(6,6) is not wall, x=6 not 0 or 7, y=6 not 0 or 7.\n\nBut at (6,5), for example.\n\nBut we need to eat food at (5,5) which is at (5,5), life_span decreasing.\n\nOn turn 79: life_span=4 for (5,5), after turn 79:3 for turn 80, after turn 80:2 for turn 81, after turn 81:1 for turn 82, after turn 82:0, gone on turn 83.\n\nSo available until turn 82.\n\nOn turn 82, if we are at (6,3) after turn 81 move.\n\nTurn 81: move U to (6,3), head to (6,3)\n\nThen turn 82: at (6,3), direction U.\n\nMove U to (6,4)\n\nThen turn 83: at (6,4), move U to (6,5)\n\nBut on turn 82, (5,5) is still available, life_span=1 on turn 82.\n\nBut we are at (6,4) on turn 82 after move.\n\nFrom (6,4), we can move L to (5,4) to get closer to (5,5).\n\nBut on turn 82, head at (6,3) before move.\n\nAfter turn 81 move to (6,3), positions: head (6,3), then (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), tail at (2,5) or something.\n\n(5,3) is occupied, for example.\n\nOn turn 82, head at (6,3), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U (6,4), D (6,2) body and opposite, invalid, L (5,3), R (7,3) wall.\n\nL to (5,3): is (5,3) occupied? Current positions: (5,3) is a body segment, not tail, so moving there would collide.\n\nSo only U to (6,4) possible.\n\nMove U to (6,4).\n\nThen on turn 83, head at (6,4), direction U.\n\nMove U to (6,5) or L to (5,4) or R wall.\n\n(5,4) might be empty.\n\nCurrent positions before turn 83 move: head (6,4), body includes (6,3), (6,2), etc., (5,4) not in positions, so empty.\n\nSo on turn 83, at (6,4), can move U to (6,5) or L to (5,4).\n\nBut (5,5) is at (5,5), and on turn 83, it is gone, since life_span=0 after turn 82.\n\nSo we missed eating (5,5).\n\nSimilarly, we are stuck on the right wall.\n\nBut this is because on turn 79, we had no choice but to go right.\n\nOn turn 79, head at (4,1), only move R to (5,1), then forced to go right and up.\n\nBut let's double-check if on turn 79, moving U was possible.\n\nHead at (4,1), U to (4,2), but (4,2) is occupied by body segment.\n\nUnless the body moves, but at the time of move, it is occupied.\n\nPerhaps the food at (3,6) is urgent, but we can't reach it in one move.\n\nFrom (4,1) to (3,6) is far, and life_span=1, so impossible to eat on turn 79.\n\nSo no loss.\n\nBut for the future, we need to find a way to eat other food.\n\nPerhaps on turn 79, moving R is the only choice, but then we can plan to go towards (5,5) or (2,5).\n\nBut from the path, we went to (6,1), (6,2), etc., away from (5,5).\n\nOn turn 80, at (5,1), after turn 79 move, head at (5,1), direction R.\n\nWe moved R to (6,1), but we could have moved U to (5,2), but (5,2) was occupied.\n\nOn turn 80, at (5,1), positions: head (5,1), body (4,1), (3,1), ..., (5,2) is body, so U to (5,2) occupied, so only R possible.\n\nSimilarly later.\n\nSo it seems we are forced into this path for now.\n\nBut on turn 81 at (6,2), we moved U to (6,3), but we could have moved L to (5,2), but (5,2) occupied.\n\nAt (6,2), L to (5,2), but (5,2) is body, so invalid.\n\nSo no choice.\n\nPerhaps we need to go down later or something.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (2,5).\n\n(2,5) has food, life_span 6 on turn 80, so available until turn 85.\n\nPosition: (2,5) is currently the tail on some turns, but as the snake moves, it might move away.\n\nFor example, if we move the snake, the tail moves.\n\nTo eat food at (2,5), we need the body to move away, then head move to it.\n\nBut since it's the tail, when the tail moves, the cell is free, then head can move to it if adjacent.\n\nBut there's a danger if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it causes collision because the new tail grows and collides.\n\nRule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nIn this case, for (2,5), if the head is adjacent and we eat it, it could be dangerous.\n\nBut currently, head is far, so not immediate issue.\n\nSimilarly for (1,1).\n\nNow, to maximize score, we need to eat food while avoiding death.\n\nBut in the current path, we are going to (6,5) or higher.\n\nFrom (6,4), on turn 83, we can move L to (5,4), then to (5,5), but (5,5) is gone by turn 83.\n\nTurn 83: (5,5) not available.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps we can go towards (2,5) or (1,1).\n\nFor example, from the current position on turn 81 at (6,2), we are moving up, but we can turn left when possible.\n\nOn turn 82 at (6,3), we move to (6,4), then on turn 83 at (6,4), we can move L to (5,4), which is empty.\n\nThen at (5,4), direction L (since moved left from (6,4)).\n\nThen we can move U to (5,5), but (5,5) is gone, or L to (4,4), etc.\n\n(4,4) might be body or not.\n\nBut let's not detail; the point is (5,5) is missed.\n\nBut we have other food.\n\n(2,5) at (2,5), life_span 6 on turn 80, so on turn 81:5, 82:4, 83:3, 84:2, 85:1, gone on 86.\n\nWe can try to go there.\n\nFrom current path, on turn 81 at (6,2), we go to (6,3), (6,4), then on turn 83 at (6,4), move L to (5,4).\n\nThen at (5,4), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U (5,5), D (5,3), L (4,4), R (6,4) body and opposite, invalid.\n\nR is opposite, invalid.\n\nU to (5,5): but (5,5) gone, and empty or not, but no food.\n\nD to (5,3): may be occupied or not.\n\nL to (4,4): may be occupied.\n\nCurrent positions at turn 83 after move to (5,4): let's assume.\n\nBut it's messy.\n\nPerhaps on turn 79, we should have done something else, but we had no choice.\n\nAnother idea: on turn 79, head at (4,1), only move R to (5,1), but after that, on turn 80 at (5,1), we have to move R to (6,1), then on turn 81 at (6,1), we moved U to (6,2), but at that point, we could have moved D, but D is (6,0) wall, invalid, or L to (5,1) occupied and opposite, so no.\n\nSo we are forced.\n\nBut let's look back at the initial state.\n\nSnake positions: head at (4,1), then (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4)\n\nNotice that (4,2) is occupied, but is there a way to free it?\n\nFor example, if we move in a way that the tail moves, but on turn 79, we can only move R.\n\nPerhaps the food at (1,1) is available for a long time.\n\nBut we need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nMaybe from the current path, we can go to (5,5) if we act earlier, but we can't because of the body blocks.\n\nAnother thought: on turn 79, the only move is R, but perhaps we can plan to eat the food at (2,5) later.\n\n(2,5) is currently occupied by the body, but as we move, it might become accessible.\n\nFor example, if we move the snake, the segment at (2,5) will move.\n\nIn the initial position, (2,5) is segment 16, not tail.\n\nTail is (1,4).\n\nAs we move right, the tail moves, so (2,5) might be free later.\n\nBut there is food at (2,5), so when the body moves away, head can eat it.\n\nBut we need to be careful with the tail danger.\n\nLet's simulate a few turns with the only possible moves.\n\nTurn 79: move R to (5,1)\n\nNew head (5,1), direction R\n\nFood: (3,6) not eaten, disappears. (5,5) life_span now 3 for next turn.\n\nTurn 80: at (5,1), only move R to (6,1)\n\nNew head (6,1), direction R\n\n(5,5) life_span now 2\n\nTurn 81: at (6,1), move U to (6,2) (only choice)\n\nNew head (6,2), direction U\n\n(5,5) life_span now 1\n\nTurn 82: at (6,2), move U to (6,3) (only choice, since L to (5,2) occupied)\n\nNew head (6,3), direction U\n\n(5,5) life_span=1, available this turn.\n\nBut we are at (6,3), (5,5) is at (5,5), not adjacent, so cannot eat.\n\nAfter this turn, (5,5) disappears.\n\nTurn 83: at (6,3), move U to (6,4) (L to (5,3) occupied, R wall, D opposite)\n\nNew head (6,4), direction U\n\nNow, food available: (2,5) life_span on turn 83: after turn 82, it was 6 on turn 80, turn 81:5, turn 82:4, turn 83:3\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) life_span turn 83: after decreases, turn 80:9, 81:8, 82:7, 83:6\n\nAt (6,4), we can move L to (5,4) or U to (6,5)\n\nL to (5,4): is it occupied? Current positions: head at (6,3), body (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), tail at (2,5)? After turn 82 move to (6,3), new positions:\n\n- Head (6,3)\n\n- Then (6,2)  // old head\n\n- (6,1)  // old index 1\n\n- (5,1)  // old index 2\n\n- (4,1)  // old index 3\n\n- (3,1)  // old index 4\n\n- (2,1)  // old index 5\n\n- (2,2)  // old index 6\n\n- (2,3)  // old index 7\n\n- (2,4)  // old index 8\n\n- (3,4)  // old index 9\n\n- (3,3)  // old index 10\n\n- (3,2)  // old index 11\n\n- (4,2)  // old index 12\n\n- (5,2)  // old index 13\n\n- (5,3)  // old index 14\n\n- (4,3)  // old index 15\n\n- (4,4)  // old index 16\n\n- (4,5)  // old index 17\n\n- (3,5)  // old index 18? Let's count indices.\n\nAfter turn 82 move to (6,3):\n\nOld head (6,2), moved to (6,3)\n\nNew body: (6,2), then where old index 1 was (6,1), old index 2 (5,1), ..., down to old index 18.\n\nOld positions turn 81: head (6,2), then (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), tail (2,5)  // 19 segments.\n\nAfter move U to (6,3):\n\nNew head (6,3)\n\nThen new body:\n- Index 1: old head (6,2)\n- Index 2: old index 1 (6,1)\n- Index 3: old index 2 (5,1)\n- Index 4: old index 3 (4,1)\n- Index 5: old index 4 (3,1)\n- Index 6: old index 5 (2,1)\n- Index 7: old index 6 (2,2)\n- Index 8: old index 7 (2,3)\n- Index 9: old index 8 (2,4)\n- Index 10: old index 9 (3,4)\n- Index 11: old index 10 (3,3)\n- Index 12: old index 11 (3,2)\n- Index 13: old index 12 (4,2)\n- Index 14: old index 13 (5,2)\n- Index 15: old index 14 (5,3)\n- Index 16: old index 15 (4,3)\n- Index 17: old index 16 (4,4)\n- Index 18: old index 17 (4,5)  // new tail\n\nTail at (4,5)\n\n(2,5) is no longer occupied; it was tail but moved away.\n\nFood at (2,5) is on the cell (2,5), which is now empty, since tail moved to (4,5)? After turn 82, positions do not include (2,5), so (2,5) is free with food.\n\nSimilarly, on turn 83, head at (6,3), we move to (6,4), or if we can, but we have to move U.\n\nAt (6,3), only U to (6,4) possible.\n\nThen on turn 84, at (6,4), we can move L to (5,4) or U to (6,5).\n\n(5,4) is empty, as not in positions.\n\nMove L to (5,4), then at (5,4), direction L.\n\nThen we can move towards (2,5) or (1,1).\n\nFor example, move D to (5,3) or L to (4,4), etc.\n\nBut (2,5) is at (2,5), life_span on turn 84: after decreases, turn 83:3, turn 84:2, so available.\n\nFrom (5,4), we can go left and down.\n\nBut let's think for the answer.\n\nSince the instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead and prioritize survival, but here survival is not immediate issue, but we need to eat food.\n\nIn the short term, we missed (5,5), but we can go for (2,5) or (1,1).\n\nBut for the answer format, we need to provide actions for turn 79 and future turns, but since future depends on food and state, we can provide a sequence based on current knowledge.\n\nPerhaps for turn 79, we have to move R, then for future turns, we can choose when possible.\n\nBut in the sequence, we can specify.\n\nSince on turn 79, only one choice, then on turn 80 only one, etc., until we have choices.\n\nFor example, on turn 83 at (6,4), we can move L to (5,4) to go towards the center.\n\nThen from there, to (2,5).\n\n(2,5) has life_span 2 on turn 84, so we need to eat it soon.\n\nLet's outline a plan.\n\nTurn 79: move R to (5,1)  (only choice)\n\nTurn 80: move R to (6,1)  (only choice)\n\nTurn 81: move U to (6,2)  (only choice)\n\nTurn 82: move U to (6,3)  (only choice)\n\nTurn 83: at (6,3), move U to (6,4)  (only choice)\n\nNow on turn 83, after move, head at (6,4), direction U.\n\nFor turn 84, at (6,4), possible moves: U (6,5), D (6,3) body and opposite, invalid, L (5,4), R (7,4) wall.\n\nR invalid.\n\nU to (6,5): empty\n\nL to (5,4): empty, as not occupied.\n\nSo we can choose L to (5,4) to go left.\n\nSimilarly, we can go U to (6,5) but that might lead to dead end.\n\nSo better to go L to (5,4) to explore.\n\nThen at (5,4), direction L (since moved left).\n\nThen for turn 85, at (5,4), moves: U (5,5), but no food, D (5,3), L (4,4), R (6,4) body and opposite, invalid.\n\nR invalid.\n\nU to (5,5): empty, no food.\n\nD to (5,3): may be occupied or not.\n\nL to (4,4): may be occupied.\n\nCurrent positions at turn 84 after move to (5,4): let's not calculate, but (4,4) might be body, (5,3) might be body.\n\nBut in general, we can go down or left.\n\nTo reach (2,5), from (5,4), move L to (4,4) if free, then down to (4,3), etc., but it might be blocked.\n\nSince (2,5) is at (2,5), and we are at (5,4), we can go left to (4,4), but (4,4) might be body, then to (3,4), etc.\n\nBut let's assume we can navigate.\n\nAlso, there is food at (1,1).\n\nBut for the answer, we need to provide actions for a few turns.\n\nPerhaps for turn 79 to 84 or so.\n\nBut on turn 79, only one action.\n\nSimilarly, for several turns, only one action until we have choices.\n\nFrom above:\n\nTurn 79: R\n\nTurn 80: R\n\nTurn 81: U\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nTurn 83: U  (to (6,4))\n\nThen on turn 84, we have a choice at (6,4): U or L.\n\nTo maximize score, we should go towards food.\n\n(2,5) at (2,5), life_span on turn 84:2, so available turn 84 and 85.\n\n(1,1) at (1,1), life_span 6 on turn 84? Turn 83:6, turn 84:5, etc.\n\nFrom (6,4), (2,5) is at (2,5), which is 4 left, 1 down, so we need to go left and down.\n\nMoving L to (5,4) is a step left.\n\nThen from (5,4), we can go D to (5,3) or L to (4,4), etc.\n\nTo reach (2,5) in 2 turns from (6,4): on turn 84 move to (5,4), then on turn 85 move to (4,4) or (5,3), not to (2,5) directly, so we need to be closer.\n\nOn turn 84, at (6,4), if we move L to (5,4), then on turn 85 at (5,4), we can move to (4,4) or (5,3), but (2,5) is still far.\n\nOn turn 85, (2,5) life_span=1, so must be eaten on turn 85 or gone.\n\nFrom (5,4) on turn 85, we can go to (4,4), then (3,4), etc., not to (2,5) immediately.\n\nDistance: from (5,4) to (2,5) is 3 left, 1 down, so at least 4 moves, but we have only one move on turn 85, so we can't reach (2,5) from (6,4) in 2 turns.\n\nTurn 84: from (6,4) to (5,4)\n\nTurn 85: from (5,4) to say (4,4) or (5,3), not to (2,5).\n\nSo we might miss (2,5) as well.\n\nThen (1,1) is available longer.\n\nBut to avoid missing, we need to head that way earlier.\n\nBut we were forced to go right and up.\n\nPerhaps on turn 83 at (6,3), we have to move U, no choice.\n\nSo it seems we might not eat any food soon, but we can survive.\n\nFor the answer, since we have to provide actions, and for turn 79, only R, then R, U, U, U, and so on.\n\nBut let's confirm if on turn 79, moving U was possible with the food rule.\n\nAnother point: food at (2,5) is under the body, but on turn 79, it's occupied, so we can't eat it.\n\nAs we move, it became free on turn 83 or so.\n\nBut we can't reach it in time for the life_span.\n\nLife_span 7 on turn 79, after turn 79:6, turn 80:5, turn 81:4, turn 82:3, turn 83:2, turn 84:1, so on turn 84 life_span=1, must eat on turn 84.\n\nOn turn 84, where are we?\n\nOn turn 83, we are at (6,4) after move.\n\nThen on turn 84, we can be at (6,5) or (5,4).\n\nFrom (6,4) to (2,5) is far, at least |6-2|=4 in x, |4-5|=1 in y, so Manhattan distance 5, so cannot reach in one move, and (2,5) will be gone after turn 84 if not eaten.\n\nSo we miss it.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) at (1,1), life_span 10 on turn 79, turn 84:5, so available.\n\nWe can go towards (1,1).\n\nFor example, from (6,4) on turn 84, move L to (5,4), then down and left.\n\nBut for now, for the sequence, we can provide the actions.\n\nSince the only possible actions for the first few turns are determined, we can list them.\n\nThen for later turns, when we have choices, we can choose to go towards food.\n\nBut for the box, we need to write the actions.\n\nPerhaps for turn 79 to 83, we have no choice, then on turn 84 we choose.\n\nBut the answer format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nLet's list for 5 turns: turn 79 to 83.\n\nTurn 79: R\n\nTurn 80: R\n\nTurn 81: U\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nTurn 83: U\n\nThen for turn 84, it depends, but we can suggest L to (5,4).\n\nBut to be precise, for the box, we can write up to turn 83 or 84.\n\nSince think 5+ turns ahead, list 5 turns.\n\nCurrent turn 79, so turns 79 to 83.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 79: R\n\nTurn 80: R\n\nTurn 81: U\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nTurn 83: U\n\nBut on turn 83, moving U to (6,4), as above.\n\nThen for survival, we are not in immediate danger.\n\nTo eat food, we can head to (1,1) later.\n\nBut for the sequence, this might be it.\n\nPerhaps I missed a move on turn 79.\n\nAnother idea: is (4,0) available? No, wall.\n\nOr perhaps the snake can move to the tail, but tail is at (1,4), not adjacent.\n\nSo no.\n\nOr food at (3,6), but we can't reach.\n\nSo I think the only sequence for now is as above.\n</think>\n### Analysis of Current State and Strategy\n\n**Current State (Turn 79):**\n- **Snake Position**: Head at (4,1), direction right (R). The snake body occupies multiple cells, including (4,2), which blocks upward movement.\n- **Walls**: Borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacle at (4,6).\n- **Food**:\n  - (3,6): Value +1, life_span 1 (must be eaten this turn or disappear).\n  - (5,5): Value +1, life_span 4 (available until turn 82).\n  - (2,5): Value +1, life_span 7 (available until turn 85).\n  - (1,1): Value +1, life_span 10 (available until turn 88).\n- **Possible Moves from (4,1) with Direction R**:\n  - Up (U) to (4,2): Occupied by body segment (not tail), so collision risk. Invalid.\n  - Down (D) to (4,0): Wall (y=0). Invalid.\n  - Left (L) to (3,1): Opposite direction (illegal) and occupied by body. Invalid.\n  - Right (R) to (5,1): Empty and safe. Valid.\n\nOnly R to (5,1) is possible on turn 79 without collision. Eating (3,6) is impossible due to distance and life_span 1.\n\n**5+ Turn Lookahead and Strategy:**\n- **Immediate Survival**: Forced to move right initially due to body blocks and walls. After turn 79, the snake is constrained to move right or up along the wall for several turns, as body segments block alternative paths.\n- **Food Prioritization**: \n  - (5,5) is reachable by turn 82 but missed due to forced path (life_span expires after turn 82).\n  - (2,5) becomes free (tail moves away) and is available until turn 85. Aim to reach it by turn 84-85.\n  - (1,1) has a long life_span; target after (2,5) or if (2,5) is missed.\n- **Path Planning**: \n  - Turns 79-83: Forced moves (R, R, U, U, U) due to body blocks and walls.\n  - Turn 84: Choice at (6,4) to go left (L) toward (2,5) or up (U). L to (5,4) is chosen to navigate toward food.\n  - Beyond turn 84: Head to (2,5) for potential eating on turn 85, then to (1,1). Avoid tail collision when eating (2,5) by ensuring head is not adjacent to tail at that moment.\n- **Risk Avoidance**: \n  - No negative food present.\n  - Wall and body collision risks are mitigated by following valid moves.\n  - Tail reward danger at (2,5) is manageable if head approaches when not adjacent to tail.\n\n**Action Sequence (Turns 79-83):**\n- Turn 79: Only possible move is R to (5,1) to avoid collision and survive.\n- Turn 80: From (5,1), only R to (6,1) is valid (U blocked by body, D wall, L illegal).\n- Turn 81: From (6,1), only U to (6,2) is valid (D wall, L blocked, R illegal after move).\n- Turn 82: From (6,2), only U to (6,3) is valid (L blocked by body, D opposite and body, R wall).\n- Turn 83: From (6,3), only U to (6,4) is valid (L blocked by body, D opposite, R wall).\n\n**Turn 84+ Suggestion (for context beyond 5 turns):**\n- At (6,4), move L to (5,4) to navigate toward (2,5) and (1,1).

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. The turn is 80. The grid is 8x8 because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates range from (1,1) to (6,6) for playable area, but with internal obstacles. Walls include borders and internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle: (4,6). So that cell is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (5,1), and direction is right (R). The body segments are listed: [(5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5)]. That's 19 segments, so the snake is long.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (5,5) with value 1 and life span 4. So it disappears after turn 80 + 4 = 84? Life span is given as 4, and it decreases each turn including current, so at turn 80, life span 4 means it has 4 turns left, including this one, so it will disappear after turn 83? Let me clarify the life span.\n\nThe rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\" So for food at (5,5) with life_span=4 on turn 80, it will be there for turns 80, 81, 82, 83, and disappear at turn 84. Similarly for others.\n\n- (2,5) with value 1 and life span 6. So disappears after turn 85? Turn 80 + 6 = 86, but since countdown includes current, life span 6: present on turns 80 to 85, gone at 86.\n\n- (1,1) with value 1 and life span 9. Present turns 80 to 88, gone at 89.\n\nAll food has value 1, so positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n\nNow, snake head is at (5,1), direction right. So possible moves: since moving right, it can go right, up, or down, but not left because that would be instant reverse. Current direction is R, so cannot go L (left) next turn.\n\nPossible moves: R (right to (6,1)), U (up to (5,2)), or D (down to (5,0)) but y=0 is wall, so down is invalid. y=0 is wall, so (5,0) is out of bounds. Similarly, x=7 is wall, so (6,1) is x=6? Grid: x from 0 to 7, walls at x=0 and x=7, so playable x=1 to 6. Similarly y=1 to 6.\n\ny=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=0 is invalid.\n\nSnake head at (5,1). Possible moves:\n\n- R: right to (6,1)\n\n- U: up to (5,2)\n\n- D: down to (5,0) but y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n\n- L: left to (4,1), but current direction is R, so moving left would be instant reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo only possible moves are R to (6,1) or U to (5,2).\n\nNow, check if these cells are safe.\n\nFirst, (6,1): is it occupied by body or wall?\n\nWalls: x=7 is wall, but (6,1) has x=6, which is not x=7, so not border wall. Internal obstacles: (4,6) is obstacle, not (6,1). So no wall.\n\nBody positions: snake positions are given, let's list them to see if (6,1) or (5,2) are occupied.\n\nSnake: head (5,1), then (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5)\n\nSo (5,2) is in the list: it's the 12th position, (5,2). So moving up to (5,2) would be colliding with body, since (5,2) is occupied by a body segment.\n\nSimilarly, (6,1): is it in the list? Let's see: (6,1) is not listed, so not occupied by body. Walls: no, so (6,1) is empty and safe to move to.\n\nBut (5,2) is occupied, so moving U to (5,2) would cause collision.\n\nTherefore, only possible move is R to (6,1).\n\nBut is that the only choice? Or is there another?\n\nD is invalid, L is not allowed, U is occupied, so only R.\n\nBut let me confirm the snake positions.\n\nPositions: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (1,5)\n\nYes, (5,2) is there, and (6,1) is not.\n\nSo for turn 80, I must move R to (6,1).\n\nBut the answer needs to be for multiple turns, thinking ahead.\n\nThe instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead and maximize score with long-term survival.\n\nSo I need to plan a sequence of moves for several turns.\n\nCurrent turn 80, I move to (6,1).\n\nThen the snake will have new head at (6,1), and the tail will move, so the segment at (1,5) will be removed, but since no food eaten, length same.\n\nNow, after moving to (6,1), the head direction was R, and I moved R, so new direction is R.\n\nNow possible moves from (6,1): R to (7,1) but x=7 wall, invalid; U to (6,2); D to (6,0) y=0 wall invalid; L to (5,1).\n\nL to (5,1) is possible, but (5,1) was the previous head, now it's the neck, but after move, the body segments shift.\n\nAfter moving to (6,1), new positions: head (6,1), then previous head (5,1) becomes body, so (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), and tail (1,5) is removed since no growth.\n\nSnake has 19 segments, after move without eating, head moves to new position, tail is removed, so 19 segments still.\n\nNew head: (6,1)\n\nNew body: (5,1), (4,1), ..., up to (2,5), and (1,5) removed? Positions: the list is from head to tail, so after moving R, new head at (6,1), then the rest: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), and since tail (1,5) is removed, the new tail is (2,5)? Let's list indices.\n\nOriginal positions: index 0: (5,1) head, 1: (4,1), 2: (3,1), 3: (2,1), 4: (2,2), 5: (2,3), 6: (2,4), 7: (3,4), 8: (3,3), 9: (3,2), 10: (4,2), 11: (5,2), 12: (5,3), 13: (4,3), 14: (4,4), 15: (4,5), 16: (3,5), 17: (2,5), 18: (1,5) tail.\n\nAfter move R, head moves to (6,1), so new head: (6,1)\n\nThen body: positions 0 to 17 become the new body segments, so (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nAnd tail was (1,5), removed, so new tail is (2,5).\n\nPositions: head (6,1), then (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\n(2,5) is the tail.\n\nNow, from (6,1), direction R.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- R: (7,1) x=7 wall, invalid\n\n- U: (6,2)\n\n- D: (6,0) y=0 wall, invalid\n\n- L: (5,1)\n\n(5,1) is occupied by body, as it's the second segment.\n\n(6,2) is not in the body positions, let's check: body has (6,1) head, (5,1), (4,1), etc., no (6,2). Walls: no, so (6,2) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1) is occupied.\n\nSo from (6,1), can move U to (6,2) or L to (5,1) but (5,1) is body, collision, so only possible move is U to (6,2).\n\nThen turn 81, move U to (6,2).\n\nNew head (6,2), direction U.\n\nThen body: (6,1), (5,1), ..., (2,5), tail (2,5) removed? After move, head to (6,2), body: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), and (2,5) removed, so new tail (3,5).\n\nPositions: head (6,2), then (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)\n\nTail is (3,5).\n\nNow, from (6,2), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,3), D to (6,1), L to (5,2), R to (7,2) invalid.\n\n(6,1) is body, occupied.\n\n(5,2) is body? Positions: (5,2) is in the list, it's the 13th or something, yes occupied.\n\n(6,3) not in positions, should be free.\n\nWalls: no.\n\nSo only U to (6,3) possible.\n\nTurn 82, move U to (6,3).\n\nNew head (6,3), direction U.\n\nBody: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), ..., (3,5), tail (3,5) removed? Head (6,3), body: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), and (3,5) removed, new tail (4,5).\n\nPositions: head (6,3), then (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nTail (4,5).\n\nFrom (6,3), direction U.\n\nMoves: U to (6,4), D to (6,2), L to (5,3), R invalid.\n\n(6,2) is body, occupied.\n\n(5,3) is body, yes in positions.\n\n(6,4) not in positions, should be free.\n\nSo move U to (6,4) turn 83.\n\nNew head (6,4), direction U.\n\nBody: (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), ..., (4,5), tail (4,5) removed? Head (6,4), body: (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), and (4,5) removed, new tail (4,4)? Positions: after (4,4) is (4,5) which was tail, removed, so new tail is (4,4).\n\nList: head (6,4), then (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nSo tail is (4,4).\n\n(4,4) is the tail.\n\nFrom (6,4), direction U.\n\nMoves: U to (6,5), D to (6,3), L to (5,4), R invalid.\n\n(6,3) is body, occupied.\n\n(5,4) not in positions? Positions: (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), no (5,4). (5,4) should be free.\n\n(6,5) not in positions.\n\nBut walls: internal obstacle at (4,6), but (6,5) is different.\n\ny=5, x=6.\n\nFood at (5,5) and (2,5), etc.\n\n(5,4) is free, (6,5) free.\n\nAlso, D to (6,3) occupied.\n\nSo can move U to (6,5) or L to (5,4).\n\nNow, need to think about food.\n\nFood at (5,5) with life span 4, on turn 80. After 4 turns, it will be gone at turn 84.\n\nTurn 80: food at (5,5) life span 4\n\nTurn 81: life span 3\n\nTurn 82: life span 2\n\nTurn 83: life span 1\n\nTurn 84: gone\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) life span 6 on turn 80: turns 80-85, gone at 86.\n\n(1,1) life span 9: turns 80-88, gone at 89.\n\nNow, at turn 83, head at (6,4), can move to (6,5) or (5,4).\n\nIf move to (6,5), then from there, can go to (5,5) or (6,6) but y=6 is wall? y=7 is wall, y=6 should be playable? Walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders, so y=1 to 6 are playable, y=6 is not wall.\n\ny=7 is wall, so y=6 is the top row, but not wall, so (6,6) is possible.\n\nBut (6,6) is x=6,y=6.\n\nInternal obstacle (4,6), but (6,6) is different.\n\nFrom (6,4), if move U to (6,5) on turn 83.\n\nThen at (6,5), direction U.\n\nFood at (5,5) is adjacent, and life span on turn 83 is 1, so it can be eaten on turn 83 or 84, but turn 83 is when we move to (6,5), not eating yet.\n\nTurn 83: head moves to (6,5), no food there.\n\nThen from (6,5), possible moves: U to (6,6), D to (6,4), L to (5,5), R invalid.\n\n(6,4) is body, occupied.\n\n(5,5) has food, and (6,6) is empty.\n\nIf move to (5,5) on turn 84, can eat the food, since life span 1 on turn 83, turn 84 it would be gone? Life span 4 on turn 80, turn 81:3, 82:2, 83:1, 84: gone. So on turn 83, food at (5,5) has life span 1, meaning it will be there for turn 83, and disappear at turn 84. So if head moves to (5,5) on turn 84, it would be gone, cannot eat.\n\nTo eat, must move to (5,5) on or before turn 83.\n\nTurn 83: head at (6,4), can move to (5,4) or (6,5).\n\nIf move to (5,4) on turn 83, then from (5,4), can move to (5,5) on turn 84.\n\nBut on turn 84, food is gone.\n\nTurn 83: if head at (6,4), and I move L to (5,4) on turn 83, then (5,4) has no food.\n\nThen turn 84, from (5,4), move to (5,5), but (5,5) gone, so no eat.\n\nIf at turn 83, I move to (6,5), then turn 84, from (6,5), I can move L to (5,5) on turn 84, but (5,5) gone, so cannot eat.\n\nTherefore, the food at (5,5) can only be eaten on turn 83 or earlier.\n\nBut on turn 83, head is at (6,4), which is adjacent to (5,5)? (6,4) to (5,5) is not adjacent; adjacent means same row or column, differ by 1 in one coordinate.\n\n(6,4) and (5,5): dx=1, dy=1, so diagonal, not adjacent. So cannot move directly to (5,5) from (6,4); only to (6,5) or (5,4) or (6,3) but (6,3) occupied.\n\nFrom (6,4), only (6,5) or (5,4) possible.\n\nNeither is (5,5), so I cannot reach (5,5) on turn 83 from (6,4).\n\nOn turn 82, head at (6,3), I could have chosen to move left or something, but on turn 82, from (6,3), only move U to (6,4), no choice.\n\nSimilarly, earlier turns no choice.\n\nSo it seems impossible to eat (5,5) because I was forced to move away and cannot reach it in time.\n\nLet's see the path.\n\nTurn 80: head at (5,1), move R to (6,1)\n\nTurn 81: from (6,1) move U to (6,2)\n\nTurn 82: from (6,2) move U to (6,3)\n\nTurn 83: from (6,3) move U to (6,4)\n\nAt turn 83, head at (6,4)\n\n(5,5) is at distance: from (6,4) to (5,5) is |dx|=1, |dy|=1, so Manhattan distance 2, but I can move only one step per turn, and on turn 83, I can go to (6,5) or (5,4), both not (5,5), and on turn 84, (5,5) gone.\n\nSo indeed, cannot eat (5,5). It will disappear uneaten.\n\nNow, other food: (2,5) at position (2,5), with life span 6, so available until turn 85.\n\nAnd (1,1) at (1,1), life span 9, available until turn 88.\n\nNow, snake is currently at (6,4) on turn 83, but let's continue from turn 80.\n\nFor turn 80, I must move R, as established.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I need to plan to eat other food.\n\nBut first, let's think about the tail and potential dangers.\n\nAlso, the food at (2,5) is currently occupied by a body segment? Snake positions: (2,5) is in the list, index 17: (2,5), and it's not the tail; tail is (1,5).\n\nBut food at (2,5) is on a body segment.\n\nThe rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nSo for (2,5), it is under body, so to eat, the snake must move so that the body leaves (2,5), then head moves to (2,5) when it's free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) is free, I think.\n\nCurrent positions: (1,1) is not in snake positions, so free.\n\n(2,5) is occupied by body.\n\nNow, at turn 80, snake tail is at (1,5), and food at (2,5) is on a body segment.\n\nAs the snake moves, the body shifts.\n\nFor example, after turn 80 move R to (6,1), tail (1,5) removed, new tail at (2,5)? Earlier I had new positions after turn 80: head (6,1), body includes (2,5) and (3,5), etc., tail is (2,5).\n\nAfter turn 80 move: head (6,1), body: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)  so (2,5) is the tail.\n\nFood at (2,5) is on the tail cell.\n\nBut the tail will move when the snake moves, so if tail is at (2,5) with food, and the snake moves, the tail leaves (2,5), so the food is exposed, then the head can move to (2,5) to eat it.\n\nBut (2,5) is far from head.\n\nAfter turn 80 move, head at (6,1), tail at (2,5).\n\nFood at (2,5) is on tail, so when snake moves next, tail moves away, food is revealed.\n\nTurn 81: move U to (6,2), head to (6,2), tail (2,5) removed, new tail at (3,5)? Positions after turn 81: head (6,2), body (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), tail (3,5)\n\nSo (2,5) is no longer occupied, food at (2,5) is now free to be eaten.\n\nLife span of (2,5) is 6 on turn 80, so turn 81: life span 5, etc., available until turn 85.\n\nHead at (6,2), (2,5) is at (2,5), which is far, Manhattan distance |6-2| + |2-5| = 4 + 3 = 7, so at least 7 moves away, but snake is long, and path may be blocked.\n\nSimilarly, food at (1,1) is at (1,1), head at (6,2), distance |6-1| + |2-1| = 5+1=6.\n\nBut with internal obstacles and body, it might be tricky.\n\nAlso, there is a danger with tail reward: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut in this case, food at (2,5) is not on tail anymore after turn 81.\n\nOn turn 81, tail is at (3,5), not (2,5).\n\nFood at (2,5) is free.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I need to eat the food, but safely.\n\nFirst, for turn 80, I have to move R, as only choice.\n\nThen turn 81, from (6,1), only move U to (6,2).\n\nTurn 82, from (6,2), only move U to (6,3).\n\nTurn 83, from (6,3), only move U to (6,4).\n\nNow at turn 83, head at (6,4), as before.\n\nFrom here, I can move U to (6,5) or L to (5,4).\n\n(5,4) is not occupied, let's check positions at turn 83.\n\nAfter turn 82 move to (6,3), positions: head (6,3), body (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), tail (4,5)? Earlier calculation.\n\nAfter turn 82: head to (6,3), body: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) but (4,5) was not removed? Let's list.\n\nAfter turn 82 move to (6,3): previous head was (6,2) at turn 81, which moved to (6,3), so new head (6,3), then body: the previous body from (6,1) to (4,5), but tail was (3,5) at turn 81? Turn 81 positions: head (6,2), body (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), tail (3,5)? (3,5) is the last, but in list it's (4,5) then (3,5), so tail (3,5).\n\nWhen moving to (6,3), head to (6,3), body: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), and tail (3,5) is removed, so new tail (4,5).\n\nPositions: head (6,3), then (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nTail (4,5).\n\nAt turn 83, from (6,3) move to (6,4) or (5,3) but (5,3) is body, occupied, so only (6,4).\n\nMove to (6,4), new head (6,4), body (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), and (4,5) removed, new tail (4,4).\n\nPositions: head (6,4), then (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nTail (4,4).\n\nNow turn 83, head at (6,4), can move U to (6,5) or L to (5,4).\n\n(5,4) is not in positions, so free.\n\n(6,5) free.\n\nFood at (5,5) is at (5,5), which is adjacent to (5,4) and (6,5), but as we saw, cannot eat it because it disappears on turn 84.\n\nSo no point going there.\n\nOther food: (2,5) at (2,5), life span 6 on turn 80, so turn 83: life span 3, available until turn 85.\n\n(1,1) life span 9, turn 83: life span 6, available until turn 88.\n\nHead at (6,4), (2,5) is at (2,5), distance |6-2| + |4-5| = 4 + 1 = 5.\n\n(1,1) at (1,1), |6-1| + |4-1| = 5+3=8.\n\nTo eat (2,5), I need to move towards it.\n\nFrom (6,4), if I move L to (5,4), then I can go left and down.\n\nIf I move U to (6,5), I go up.\n\n(6,5) is closer to top, but (2,5) is on row 5, column 2.\n\nAlso, there is an internal obstacle at (4,6), which is above.\n\nLet's think about the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, walls at edges.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), so (4,6) blocked.\n\nSnake body is occupying many cells.\n\nFrom (6,4), if I move L to (5,4) on turn 83.\n\nThen head to (5,4), direction L (since from (6,4) to (5,4) is left).\n\nThen body: (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), and tail (4,4) removed, new tail (4,3)? Positions: after (4,3) is (4,4) tail removed, so new tail (4,3).\n\nList: head (5,4), then (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3)\n\nTail (4,3).\n\nFrom (5,4), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: L to (4,4), but (4,4) is not in current positions? Current positions have (4,3), (4,2), but (4,4) is not, so free? (4,4) was tail at previous, but removed, so free.\n\nU to (5,5), D to (5,3), R to (6,4) but (6,4) is body, occupied.\n\nD to (5,3) is body, occupied, as (5,3) in positions.\n\nU to (5,5) has food, but life span, on turn 83, food at (5,5) life span 1, so if I move to (5,5) now, I can eat it.\n\nFrom (5,4), I can move U to (5,5) on turn 83.\n\n(5,5) is adjacent, and life span 1, so if I move there, I eat the food, snake grows.\n\nBut is it safe?\n\nFirst, move U to (5,5) from (5,4).\n\nCurrent direction is L (since moved left to (5,4)), so moving U is not reverse, ok.\n\n(5,5) is free, no body or wall.\n\nBut after eating, snake grows, so new head at (5,5), and tail not removed.\n\nPositions: after moving to (5,5) and eating, new head (5,5), body includes all previous, so length increases.\n\nPrevious positions before move: head (5,4), body (6,4), (6,3), ..., (4,3), tail (4,3).\n\nAfter move to (5,5), new head (5,5), then the previous head (5,4) becomes body, so (5,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3)\n\nAnd tail (4,3) stays since growth.\n\nLength was 19, now 20.\n\nNow, from (5,5), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,6), D to (5,4), L to (4,5), R to (6,5)\n\n(5,4) is body, occupied.\n\n(6,5) is free? Not in positions.\n\n(4,5) : (4,5) is not in positions, but internal obstacle? Walls: internal obstacle at (4,6), not (4,5). (4,5) should be free.\n\n(5,6) is y=6, not wall.\n\nBut (4,6) is obstacle, so (4,6) blocked.\n\nSo moves: U (5,6), D occupied, L (4,5), R (6,5)\n\nAll seem possible except D.\n\nBut need to check if any occupied.\n\n(5,4) occupied, so D invalid.\n\nU (5,6), L (4,5), R (6,5) all free.\n\nBut life span of food at (5,5) was 1 on turn 83, eaten, so gone.\n\nNow, other food.\n\nBut we are at turn 83, and I need to think ahead.\n\nFor turn 80, I have to move R.\n\nThen for turn 81, 82, only one choice each.\n\nAt turn 83, I have a choice: move U to (6,5) or L to (5,4).\n\nIf I move L to (5,4), then I can eat (5,5) on this turn if I move U, but at turn 83, from (6,4) moving L to (5,4), then from (5,4) I can move U to (5,5) on turn 84, but on turn 84, (5,5) is gone, so cannot eat.\n\nTurn 83: from (6,4) move to (5,4) or (6,5).\n\nIf I move to (5,4), position (5,4), then on turn 84, from (5,4), I can move to (5,5), but (5,5) will be gone on turn 84, so no food.\n\nIf I move to (6,5) on turn 83, then on turn 84, from (6,5), I can move to (5,5), but again, (5,5) gone, no eat.\n\nSo I cannot eat (5,5) at all.\n\nSo for turn 83, moving to (5,4) or (6,5) doesn't matter for (5,5).\n\nBut for other food, moving to (5,4) might be better to go towards (2,5) or (1,1).\n\n(2,5) is at (2,5), which is row 5, column 2.\n\nHead at (6,4), so to go to (2,5), I need to go left and a bit down or up.\n\nFrom (6,4), moving L to (5,4) is towards left.\n\nMoving U to (6,5) is away.\n\nAlso, (6,5) is closer to the obstacle at (4,6), but not directly.\n\nMoreover, the body is below, so moving down might be blocked.\n\nAt turn 83, after moving to (6,4), positions as above.\n\nIf I move L to (5,4) on turn 83, head to (5,4), direction L.\n\nThen turn 84, from (5,4), can move U to (5,5), but no food; L to (4,4); D to (5,3) but (5,3) is body; R to (6,4) body occupied.\n\nSo possible moves: U (5,5), L (4,4), and that's it, since D and R occupied.\n\n(5,3) occupied, (6,4) occupied.\n\nU (5,5) free, L (4,4) free? (4,4) is not in positions, so free.\n\nSo from (5,4), can move U or L.\n\nSimilarly, if on turn 83 I moved U to (6,5), then at (6,5), turn 84 can move U to (6,6), L to (5,5), D to (6,4) occupied.\n\nSo U (6,6), L (5,5), both free.\n\nBut no food.\n\nNow, to reach (2,5), it is at (2,5), and life span until turn 85.\n\nTurn 83, life span of (2,5) is 3 (since turn 80:6, 81:5, 82:4, 83:3, so 3 turns left, available at turn 83,84,85, gone 86).\n\nHead at (6,4) turn 83, to (2,5) distance 5, so I need to move towards it quickly.\n\nFrom (6,4), moving L to (5,4) on turn 83 gets me closer.\n\nThen from (5,4) turn 83, if I move L to (4,4) on turn 84? Turn 84 from (5,4).\n\nBut let's plan a path.\n\nAlso, the food at (2,5) is free, but the snake body might be in the way.\n\nMoreover, there is a potential danger with the tail.\n\nBut let's see the current tail position.\n\nAt turn 83, tail is at (4,4).\n\nAs the snake moves, the tail moves.\n\nTo eat (2,5), I need the head to move there when it's free, which it is.\n\nPath from (6,4) to (2,5): for example, (6,4) -> (5,4) -> (4,4) -> (3,4) -> (2,4) -> (2,5) or something.\n\nBut need to check if cells are free.\n\nAt turn 83, positions have (4,4) as tail, so when I move, it may be free.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nTurn 83: move from (6,4) to (5,4), head to (5,4), direction L.\n\nBody: (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), and tail (4,4) removed? Head to (5,4), so new head (5,4), body: (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), and tail (4,4) removed, new tail (4,3).\n\nPositions: head (5,4), then (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3)\n\nTail (4,3).\n\n(2,5) is free and has food.\n\nTurn 84, from (5,4), can move U to (5,5) or L to (4,4).\n\n(4,4) is free now, since tail moved.\n\nIf move L to (4,4), head to (4,4), direction L.\n\nThen body: (5,4), (6,4), ..., (4,3), tail (4,3) removed, new tail (5,3)? Positions: head (4,4), then (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3) removed, so new tail (5,3).\n\n(5,3) is body.\n\nFrom (4,4), direction L.\n\nMoves: L to (3,4), U to (4,5), D to (4,3), R to (5,4) occupied.\n\n(4,3) is body, occupied.\n\n(5,4) occupied.\n\n(3,4) is in positions? (3,4) is in the list, yes, occupied.\n\n(4,5) not in positions, free.\n\nU to (4,5) or D to (4,3) occupied, so only U to (4,5) possible? L to (3,4) is occupied.\n\n(3,4) is body, so only U to (4,5) or perhaps other, but U is only choice.\n\n(4,5) is free.\n\nSo move U to (4,5) on turn 84.\n\nBut (4,5) has no food, and internal obstacle at (4,6) above.\n\nHead to (4,5), direction U.\n\nThen turn 85, from (4,5), can move U to (4,6) but (4,6) is internal obstacle, wall, invalid; D to (4,4) body occupied; L to (3,5); R to (5,5) free.\n\n(4,4) occupied, (5,5) free, (3,5) not in positions? (3,5) was earlier, but not in current, so free.\n\nSo can move L to (3,5) or R to (5,5).\n\nBut (2,5) is at (2,5), adjacent to (3,5) and (2,4), etc.\n\nLife span of (2,5) on turn 85 is 1 (turn 80:6, 81:5, 82:4, 83:3, 84:2, 85:1, gone 86).\n\nSo on turn 85, I can eat it if I reach.\n\nFrom (4,5) turn 85, if I move L to (3,5), then (3,5) is not (2,5), so not eating.\n\nThen from (3,5) turn 86, (2,5) gone.\n\nIf from (4,5) I move directly to (2,5), not adjacent.\n\nDistance from (4,5) to (2,5) is |4-2| + |5-5| = 2, so need two moves, but on turn 85, only one move, can go to (3,5) or (4,4) or (5,5), not directly to (2,5).\n\n(3,5) is adjacent to (2,5), so if I go to (3,5) on turn 85, then on turn 86, I can move to (2,5), but (2,5) will be gone on turn 86, since life span 1 on turn 85, gone at turn 86.\n\nSo I cannot eat (2,5) either, because I can't reach it by turn 85.\n\nHead at turn 83 is at (6,4), (2,5) is 5 cells away, and I have only 3 turns to reach it (turn 83,84,85 to move and eat on or before turn 85).\n\nFrom (6,4) to (2,5): minimum 5 moves, but I have only 3 moves (turn 83,84,85), so impossible to reach by turn 85.\n\nFor example, (6,4) to (5,4) turn 83, then (4,4) turn 84, then (3,4) or (3,5) turn 85, then (2,5) turn 86, but turn 86 food gone.\n\nIf I go faster, but Manhattan distance is 5, so at least 5 moves needed, but only 3 turns left for action, so can't reach in time.\n\nSimilarly, from other positions.\n\nSo (2,5) cannot be eaten.\n\nNow only food left is (1,1) at (1,1), life span 9 on turn 80, so on turn 83, life span 6, available until turn 88.\n\nHead at (6,4) turn 83, distance to (1,1) is |6-1| + |4-1| = 5+3=8, so I can reach it in 8 moves, and it available for 6 more turns? Turn 83 to 88, so I can eat it on turn 88 at latest.\n\nTurn 88: life span 1, eat on turn 88.\n\nSo I have from turn 83 to 88, 6 turns to move 8 cells, but since the snake moves one per turn, I need to cover the distance in the moves.\n\nAlso, the grid has obstacles and body, so path might be longer.\n\nBut let's see the shortest path: (6,4) to (1,1), e.g., left and down: (6,4) -> (5,4) -> (4,4) -> (3,4) -> (2,4) -> (2,3) -> (2,2) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) but (2,1) to (1,1) is possible.\n\nBut some cells may be occupied.\n\nAt turn 83, positions include (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), etc., so those are occupied.\n\nI need to go around or wait for body to move.\n\nSince the snake is moving, the body will shift, and cells will free up over time.\n\nFor example, the tail is at (4,4) at turn 83, but as we move, it changes.\n\nTo maximize survival, I should navigate to open areas and eat the food at (1,1) when possible.\n\nBut first, for the immediate turns, at turn 83, I have to choose between U to (6,5) or L to (5,4).\n\nMoving L to (5,4) is towards (1,1), so better for long-term.\n\nMoving U to (6,5) is towards the top, which has the obstacle at (4,6), and less space.\n\nAlso, from (6,5), I can go to (6,6) or (5,5), but no food.\n\nThen from there, I need to go down and left, which might take more time.\n\nWhereas from (5,4), I can go left to (4,4), then down or left.\n\nBut earlier at turn 84 from (5,4), I can move L to (4,4) or U to (5,5).\n\nIf I move L to (4,4), then to (3,4) but occupied, etc.\n\nLet's think about freeing up the left side.\n\nThe body is concentrated on the left and bottom, so moving the head left might be risky if I collide, but if I move carefully.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should aim for (1,1).\n\nAlso, there might be other food spawning, but in this state, only these three are given, and no new food mentioned, so I assume only these for now.\n\nThe state has only these food items.\n\nSo for turn 80, I must move R.\n\nThen turn 81: U (only choice)\n\nTurn 82: U (only choice)\n\nTurn 83: I can choose U or L.\n\nBut to go towards (1,1), moving L to (5,4) is better.\n\nThen from there, I can continue.\n\nBut let's outline the moves.\n\nTurn 80: R\n\nTurn 81: U\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nTurn 83: L (to (5,4))\n\nThen turn 84: from (5,4), as before, can move U to (5,5) or L to (4,4)\n\nMoving U to (5,5) is up, away from (1,1), so better to move L to (4,4) to go left.\n\nThen turn 84: move L to (4,4)\n\nHead to (4,4), direction L.\n\nThen body: (5,4), (6,4), etc., tail removed, new tail.\n\nFrom (4,4), as before, only U to (4,5) possible, since other directions occupied.\n\nMove U to (4,5) turn 84.\n\nThen turn 85: from (4,5), can move L to (3,5) or R to (5,5) or U invalid.\n\nMove to (3,5) to go left.\n\nHead to (3,5), direction L.\n\nThen body: (4,5), (5,4), etc., tail removed.\n\nFrom (3,5), possible moves: L to (2,5), but (2,5) has food, but life span on turn 85 is 1, so if I move to (2,5) on turn 85, I can eat it.\n\n(2,5) is adjacent to (3,5), so yes.\n\nBut earlier I thought (2,5) cannot be eaten, but from here it is possible.\n\nTurn 85: head at (3,5), move L to (2,5) to eat.\n\nLife span: on turn 85, life span 1, so eating on turn 85 is possible.\n\nThen snake grows.\n\nBut is it safe?\n\n(2,5) is free, no issue.\n\nBut after eating, head at (2,5), and the body.\n\nCurrent positions before move: at turn 85, from (4,5) move to (3,5), so head to (3,5), body: (4,5), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3) or something, but let's not detail.\n\nThen move to (2,5), eat, so new head (2,5), body includes previous, length +1.\n\nFrom (2,5), direction L.\n\nThen I can move to (1,5) or (2,6) but y=6 max, (2,6) possible, or (3,5) but (3,5) is body now, etc.\n\nBut (1,5) is free? Not sure.\n\nBut for now, at turn 83, if I move L to (5,4), then I can reach (2,5) on turn 85 to eat.\n\nSimilarly, if on turn 83 I move U to (6,5), it might not be possible.\n\nLet's confirm the path.\n\nTurn 83: head at (6,4), move L to (5,4)\n\nTurn 84: from (5,4), move L to (4,4)  (since U to (5,5) no food, L to (4,4) towards goal)\n\nIn turn 84, from (5,4), moving L to (4,4) is possible, as (4,4) is free.\n\nThen head to (4,4), direction L.\n\nThen only move U to (4,5), as other directions occupied.\n\nMove U to (4,5) turn 84.\n\nTurn 85: from (4,5), move L to (3,5)  (to go towards (2,5))\n\n(3,5) is free? At this point, positions: after move to (4,5), body includes (4,4), (5,4), etc., and (3,5) not occupied, so free.\n\nMove to (3,5), head to (3,5), direction L (since from (4,5) to (3,5) is left).\n\nThen turn 85, move to (3,5), no eat yet.\n\nLife span of (2,5) on turn 85 is 1, so to eat, must move to (2,5) on turn 85 or earlier, but turn 85 I am at (3,5), so I can move to (2,5) on turn 86, but on turn 86, food gone.\n\nTurn 85: from (4,5) to (3,5), at (3,5) on turn 85.\n\nThen to eat (2,5), I need to move to (2,5) on turn 86, but turn 86, (2,5) disappeared.\n\nLife span: on turn 85, life span 1, meaning it is present on turn 85, and disappears after, so on turn 86, it is gone.\n\nSo to eat, must be on the cell on turn 85 or before.\n\nOn turn 85, I am at (3,5), not at (2,5), so I cannot eat it on turn 85.\n\nOn turn 86, if I move to (2,5), it's gone.\n\nSo I cannot eat (2,5).\n\nSimilarly for all, only (1,1) is possible.\n\nBut let's accept that and go for (1,1).\n\nFor turn 83, moving L to (5,4) is better to start heading to (1,1).\n\nThen from there, I can navigate down and left.\n\nBut the body is in the way, so I need to go around or wait.\n\nSince the snake is long, moving might free up space.\n\nFor example, from (5,4) turn 83, move L to (4,4) turn 84.\n\nThen U to (4,5) turn 84 (only choice).\n\nThen from (4,5) turn 85, move L to (3,5) or R to (5,5).\n\nMove L to (3,5) turn 85.\n\nThen from (3,5) turn 86, can move L to (2,5) but no food, or D to (3,4), or U to (3,6), or R to (4,5) body.\n\n(3,4) may be occupied or not.\n\nAt turn 85, after move to (3,5), positions include (3,4) as body, so occupied.\n\nU to (3,6) y=6, possible.\n\nD to (3,4) occupied.\n\nL to (2,5) free.\n\nR to (4,5) body.\n\nSo move L to (2,5) or U to (3,6).\n\nMove L to (2,5) to go left.\n\nThen turn 86, at (2,5), no food.\n\nThen from (2,5), can move to (1,5) or (2,4) or (2,6), etc.\n\n(1,5) might be free.\n\nThen to (1,4), (1,3), down to (1,1).\n\nBut (1,1) has food, life span until turn 88.\n\nSo possible.\n\nIf I move U to (3,6) on turn 85, it might delay.\n\nBut to save time, at turn 83, move L to (5,4).\n\nThen for the answer, I need to provide moves from turn 80 onwards.\n\nBut for turn 80,81,82, only one choice, turn 83 I choose L.\n\nThen subsequent turns I can choose.\n\nBut the answer format is to list actions for several turns, at least 5+ turns ahead, so up to turn 85 or more.\n\nTurn 80 to 85 is 6 turns.\n\nLet's list:\n\nTurn 80: R (only choice)\n\nTurn 81: U (only)\n\nTurn 82: U (only)\n\nTurn 83: L (to (5,4))  -- I choose L to go towards (1,1)\n\nThen turn 84: from (5,4), move L to (4,4)  (assume we go left)\n\nTurn 85: from (4,4), but after turn 83 move to (5,4), turn 84 move to (4,4), then from (4,4) only U to (4,5) as before.\n\nSo turn 84: move to (4,4), then turn 85: from (4,4) move U to (4,5)? No.\n\nAt turn 84, from (5,4) move to (4,4), head to (4,4), then turn 85 from (4,4) move U to (4,5) (only choice)\n\nThen turn 86 from (4,5) move L to (3,5)\n\n Etc.\n\nBut for the answer, I can list up to turn 85.\n\nSince thinking ahead, but for the box, I need to output the actions.\n\nPerhaps for turn 83, moving U to (6,5) is also possible, but it might lead to dead end or less efficient.\n\nFor example, if move U to (6,5) on turn 83, then turn 84 move to (6,6) or (5,5), say (5,5) but no food, then from there, to go to (1,1) is farther.\n\nSo moving L is better.\n\nAlso, there is the food at (1,1) to consider.\n\nBut for now, I think for turn 83, L is better.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 80: R\n\nTurn 81: U\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nTurn 83: L\n\nThen for turn 84, from (5,4), I can move L to (4,4) or U to (5,5). Since U is away, move L to (4,4).\n\nTurn 84: L\n\nThen turn 85, from (4,4), only U to (4,5), so turn 85: U\n\nThen I can stop or continue.\n\nBut the instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead, so from turn 80 to 85 is 6 turns.\n\nTurn 80,81,82,83,84,85: that's 6 actions.\n\nAnd for turn 85, I have U.\n\nBut to be precise.\n\nSince at turn 83 I have a choice, and I chose L, but in the sequence, for turn 84 and 85, it might be forced or choice.\n\nBut in this case, after turn 83 L, turn 84 from (5,4) move L to (4,4), then turn 85 from (4,4) move U to (4,5), no other choice, so it's fine.\n\nSimilarly, if I had moved U at turn 83, it would be different.\n\nBut I think L is better.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 80: R\nTurn 81: U\nTurn 82: U\nTurn 83: L\nTurn 84: L\nTurn 85: U\n}\n\nBut turn 84: L from (5,4) to (4,4), and turn 85: U from (4,4) to (4,5).\n\nAnd this gets me closer to the left side.\n\nThen from there, I can continue to (3,5), (2,5), etc., to reach (1,1) eventually.\n\nBut since the answer is for multiple turns, this should be ok.\n\nTo maximize score, I need to eat the food at (1,1), but it will take more turns, so beyond turn 85.\n\nBut the instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead, not necessarily eat within 5 turns.\n\nSo the sequence above is fine.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan for Snake Game\n\n**Current State (Turn 80):**\n- **Grid**: 8x8 (playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6; walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacle at (4,6)).\n- **Snake**: Head at (5,1), direction Right (R). Positions: 19 segments (long snake), body densely packed in the left and bottom areas.\n- **Food**:\n  - (5,5): Value +1, life span 4 (disappears after turn 83, available on turns 80-83).\n  - (2,5): Value +1, life span 6 (disappears after turn 85, available on turns 80-85).\n  - (1,1): Value +1, life span 9 (disappears after turn 88, available on turns 80-88).\n- **Constraints**: \n  - Immediate moves from (5,1) with direction R: Only R to (6,1) is valid (U to (5,2) is body collision, D to (5,0) is wall, L is instant reverse).\n  - Food at (2,5) is under body (segment at turn 80) but can be eaten if body moves away and head moves in later.\n  - Food at (5,5) and (2,5) cannot be eaten due to distance and life span constraints (detailed below).\n  - Primary long-term goal: Survive and eat (1,1) by turn 88, as it is the only achievable food.\n\n**Key Insights from 5+ Turn Lookahead:**\n1. **Turn 80-82 Moves are Forced**: \n   - Turn 80: Only R to (6,1) is safe (no collision or wall).\n   - Turn 81: From (6,1), only U to (6,2) is valid (L to (5,1) is body collision, R/D invalid due to walls).\n   - Turn 82: From (6,2), only U to (6,3) is valid (other moves blocked by body or walls).\n   - Result: By turn 83, head is at (6,4) with no food eaten.\n\n2. **Food at (5,5) Cannot Be Eaten**:\n   - Distance from (6,4) at turn 83 to (5,5) is Manhattan 2, but only 1 move left (turn 83) before it disappears after turn 83.\n   - Moves from (6,4) are to (6,5) or (5,4)—neither reaches (5,5) on turn 83. On turn 84, (5,5) is gone.\n\n3. **Food at (2,5) Cannot Be Eaten**:\n   - At turn 83, head at (6,4), (2,5) is Manhattan distance 5 away.\n   - Life span allows eating until turn 85 (3 moves: turns 83, 84, 85), but minimum path is 5 moves (e.g., (6,4) → (5,4) → (4,4) → (3,4) → (2,4) → (2,5)). Cannot reach by turn 85.\n\n4. **Food at (1,1) is Achievable**:\n   - Life span until turn 88 (6 moves from turn 83: turns 83-88).\n   - Head at (6,4) at turn 83, (1,1) is Manhattan distance 8. With body blocking, a safe path exists by moving left/down to avoid collisions.\n   - Moving left at turn 83 ((5,4)) is optimal to start path toward (1,1).\n\n5. **Risk of Tail Reward Danger**: \n   - Not applicable here—food at (2,5) was on tail at turn 80, but tail moves away by turn 81, exposing the food. However, as eating is impossible, no danger.\n   - For (1,1), no tail adjacency issues expected.\n\n6. **Survival Strategy**:\n   - Avoid walls and body: Grid has open space on the right/top, but moving left/down toward (1,1) is better for long-term access to food and open areas.\n   - Post-turn 85, navigate to (1,1) via path like (4,5) → (3,5) → (2,5) → (1,5) → (1,4) → (1,3) → (1,2) → (1,1), eating on turn 88.\n   - Internal obstacle at (4,6) is avoided by not moving up unnecessarily.\n\n**Move Sequence (Turns 80-85):**\n- **Turn 80 (head: (5,1), dir: R)**: Only valid move is R to (6,1) (avoids collision/wall).\n- **Turn 81 (head: (6,1), dir: R)**: Only valid move is U to (6,2) (L is body collision, R/D walls).\n- **Turn 82 (head: (6,2), dir: U)**: Only valid move is U to (6,3) (L/R/D blocked by body or walls).\n- **Turn 83 (head: (6,3), dir: U)**: Move L to (5,4) (U to (6,5) possible but wastes time; L starts path to (1,1) and avoids dead ends).\n- **Turn 84 (head: (5,4), dir: L)**: Move L to (4,4) (U to (5,5) has no food and delays; L continues toward (1,1)).\n- **Turn 85 (head: (4,4), dir: L)**: Only valid move is U to (4,5) (L to (3,4) and D to (4,3) are body collisions, R to (5,4) is body).\n\n**Next Moves Beyond Turn 85 (for context):**\n- Turn 86: From (4,5), move L to (3,5) (continue left toward (1,1)).\n- Turn 87: From (3,5), move L to (2,5) (no food, but path to left).\n- Turn 88: From (2,5), move D to (2,4) or L to (1,5), then proceed to (1,1) for eating.\n\nThis sequence ensures survival, avoids all immediate risks, and sets up for eating (1,1) by turn 88. No points scored in turns 80-85, but long-term survival prioritized.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 80: R\nTurn 81: U\nTurn 82: U\nTurn 83: L\nTurn 84: L\nTurn 85: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 81, and I'm the snake AI. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (4,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders and (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (6,1), and the body segments follow. The head direction is right (R), so it's moving to the right.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (5,5) with value 1 and life span 3 (so it disappears after 3 turns, including this one, so it has 2 more turns after this)\n\n- (2,5) with value 1 and life span 5 (4 more turns after this)\n\n- (1,1) with value 1 and life span 8 (7 more turns after this)\n\nAll food has positive value (+1), so no negative food here.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's map out the snake's body to understand where it is and possible collisions.\n\nSnake positions: [(6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nHead at (6,1), tail at (2,5). The snake has 19 segments.\n\nSince the head is moving right, from (6,1), if I go right, I go to (7,1). But x=7 is a wall, so moving right into x=7 would be a wall collision, death. So I cannot move right.\n\nCurrent head direction is R, so I can only move up, down, or left, but not right? No, the movement constraints say I can choose any direction except the opposite if it would cause instant reverse. But since I'm moving right, the opposite is left. So I can move up, down, or right, but right is into wall, so not possible. Left is opposite? Let's see.\n\nThe rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n\nCurrent direction is R (right), so opposite is L (left). So I cannot move left on this turn because it would be instant reverse.\n\nTherefore, possible moves from (6,1) with direction R:\n\n- Up (U) to (6,2) since y increases up? Let's confirm coordinates.\n\nTypically in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? The walls are y=0 and y=7, and snake is at y=1, so probably y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? Or vice versa.\n\nIn the movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1). So if U is y+1, that means y increases upwards, so (0,0) is bottom-left, (7,7) is top-right.\n\nBut walls: y=0 is bottom wall, y=7 is top wall, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nSnake head at (6,1), which is near the bottom-right corner.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U (up): to (6,2)\n\n- D (down): to (6,0), but y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n\n- L (left): to (5,1), but since current direction is R, moving left is opposite, so instant reverse not allowed. Therefore, cannot move left.\n\n- R (right): to (7,1), but x=7 is wall, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is Up to (6,2).\n\nIs that right?\n\nCurrent direction R, so moving left would be reverse, not allowed.\n\nMoving right to (7,1) is wall.\n\nMoving down to (6,0) is wall.\n\nOnly up to (6,2) is possible.\n\nBut (6,2) is occupied by the snake body? Let's check the positions.\n\nSnake positions: head (6,1), then (5,1), (4,1), etc. (5,2) is a body segment? Positions: [(6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nSo (6,2) is not in the list? Let's see all y=2 points: (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) are in the body. (6,2) is not listed, so it should be empty.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1) is body, (6,0) wall, (7,1) wall.\n\nSo from (6,1), only possible move is to (6,2).\n\nBut (6,2) is not occupied by body? Positions: (5,2) is at (5,2), which is different from (6,2). (6,2) is not in the list, so it's free, I think.\n\nList all positions:\n\nx from 2 to 6, y from 1 to 5.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- (6,1) head\n\n- (5,1)\n\n- (4,1)\n\n- (3,1)\n\n- (2,1)\n\n- (2,2)\n\n- (2,3)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (4,2)\n\n- (5,2)\n\n- (5,3)\n\n- (4,3)\n\n- (4,4)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (3,5)\n\n- (2,5)\n\nNow, (6,2): not listed, so empty.\n\n(5,2) is at (5,2), not (6,2).\n\n(6,2) should be empty and not wall, since walls are borders and (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is an obstacle, but (6,2) is fine.\n\nAlso, no other walls mentioned.\n\nSo moving to (6,2) is possible.\n\nBut is it safe? After moving, the head goes to (6,2), and since the tail moves, the body might shift.\n\nIn general, when the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail is removed, unless food is eaten.\n\nIf no food eaten, tail moves away, so the cell that was tail is freed.\n\nBut in this case, moving to (6,2), no food there, so snake grows by moving head to (6,2), and tail (2,5) is removed.\n\nThen the new positions: head at (6,2), then (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), ..., up to (3,5), and tail at (2,5) removed? Let's see the sequence.\n\nOriginal positions: indices 0: (6,1) head, 1: (5,1), 2: (4,1), 3: (3,1), 4: (2,1), 5: (2,2), 6: (2,3), 7: (2,4), 8: (3,4), 9: (3,3), 10: (3,2), 11: (4,2), 12: (5,2), 13: (5,3), 14: (4,3), 15: (4,4), 16: (4,5), 17: (3,5), 18: (2,5) tail.\n\nAfter moving up to (6,2), head to (6,2), so new head is (6,2), then the body: since we move, the segment at index 0 moves to new position, so new position 0: (6,2), then position 1: old head (6,1), position 2: (5,1), ..., up to position 18: (3,5), and tail was (2,5), but since no food eaten, tail is removed, so the last segment (2,5) is gone, and the new tail is (3,5)? Let's list:\n\nNew positions: head: (6,2), then body: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5). And (2,5) is removed.\n\n(3,5) is now the tail? From above, position 17 was (3,5), which is now the last segment since (2,5) removed.\n\nOriginal positions: 0:(6,1), 1:(5,1), 2:(4,1), 3:(3,1), 4:(2,1), 5:(2,2), 6:(2,3), 7:(2,4), 8:(3,4), 9:(3,3), 10:(3,2), 11:(4,2), 12:(5,2), 13:(5,3), 14:(4,3), 15:(4,4), 16:(4,5), 17:(3,5), 18:(2,5)\n\nAfter move: head to (6,2), so new pos 0: (6,2)\n\nThen new pos 1: old pos 0: (6,1)\n\nNew pos 2: old pos 1: (5,1)\n\nNew pos 3: old pos 2: (4,1)\n\nNew pos 4: old pos 3: (3,1)\n\nNew pos 5: old pos 4: (2,1)\n\nNew pos 6: old pos 5: (2,2)\n\nNew pos 7: old pos 6: (2,3)\n\nNew pos 8: old pos 7: (2,4)\n\nNew pos 9: old pos 8: (3,4)\n\nNew pos 10: old pos 9: (3,3)\n\nNew pos 11: old pos 10: (3,2)\n\nNew pos 12: old pos 11: (4,2)\n\nNew pos 13: old pos 12: (5,2)\n\nNew pos 14: old pos 13: (5,3)\n\nNew pos 15: old pos 14: (4,3)\n\nNew pos 16: old pos 15: (4,4)\n\nNew pos 17: old pos 16: (4,5)\n\nNew pos 18: old pos 17: (3,5)  // since tail removed, no old pos 18\n\nOld tail (2,5) is gone.\n\nSo new snake: [(6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)] with head at (6,2), tail at (3,5).\n\nDirection: since I moved up, new direction is U.\n\nNow, back to current turn: I must move, and only possible move is U to (6,2).\n\nBut is there a risk? (6,2) is empty, so no collision. And no wall.\n\nSo for turn 81, I have to move U.\n\nBut I need to think ahead for multiple turns.\n\nAlso, food: I need to consider eating food.\n\nFood at (5,5) life span 3, so after this turn, it has 2 turns left? Current turn t=81, food life span: it disappears after N turns, including current. So for (5,5), life_span=3, so at turn 81, it exists, at turn 82, if not eaten, life_span decreases to 2, at turn 83 to 1, and after turn 83, it disappears, so it can be eaten on turns 81,82,83.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) life span 5, exists until turn 85, can be eaten on 81 to 85.\n\n(1,1) life span 8, exists until turn 88.\n\nNow, (2,5) is currently occupied by the snake tail? In the positions, (2,5) is the tail, and there is food at (2,5) with value 1.\n\nBut according to the rules, food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves in.\n\nCurrently, (2,5) has food and is tail, so if I move such that the tail moves away, then later head can eat it.\n\nBut \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because after eating, tail grows and collides.\n\nBut here, head is at (6,1), tail at (2,5), not adjacent.\n\nAdjacent means sharing a side, so (6,1) and (2,5) are not adjacent; they are far.\n\nDistance: |dx|=4, |dy|=4, so not adjacent.\n\nSo no immediate danger.\n\nNow for turn 81, I must move U to (6,2), as that's the only option.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I need to plan.\n\nAfter moving to (6,2), head at (6,2), direction U.\n\nNow possible moves from (6,2): U, D, L, R.\n\nBut direction U, so cannot move down (opposite).\n\nAlso, walls: x=7 right, x=0 left, y=7 up, y=0 down.\n\n(6,2): U to (6,3), D to (6,1), but (6,1) is now body? After move, positions: head (6,2), then (6,1) is the second segment, so moving to (6,1) would be body collision.\n\nR to (7,2), x=7 wall.\n\nL to (5,2), but (5,2) is body? New positions: (6,2) head, (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), etc. So (5,2) is a body segment.\n\nSpecifically, (5,2) is position 13 in the new list? Let's index: 0:(6,2), 1:(6,1), 2:(5,1), 3:(4,1), 4:(3,1), 5:(2,1), 6:(2,2), 7:(2,3), 8:(2,4), 9:(3,4), 10:(3,3), 11:(3,2), 12:(4,2), 13:(5,2), 14:(5,3), 15:(4,3), 16:(4,4), 17:(4,5), 18:(3,5)\n\nSo (5,2) is at index 13, which is body.\n\nTherefore, from (6,2), possible moves:\n\n- U to (6,3): not occupied? (6,3) not in positions, so empty.\n\n- D to (6,1): but (6,1) is position 1, body, collision.\n\n- L to (5,2): position 13, body, collision.\n\n- R to (7,2): x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is U to (6,3).\n\nAgain, only one choice.\n\nSo on turn 81+1=82, I must move U to (6,3).\n\nThen at (6,3), head, direction U.\n\nNow possible moves: U to (6,4), D to (6,2) but (6,2) is now body? After previous move to (6,3), let's simulate.\n\nAfter turn 81: move U to (6,2), positions as above.\n\nTurn 82: move U to (6,3), so new head (6,3), then body: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), ..., up to (4,5), and tail (3,5) removed? No food, so tail removed.\n\nNew positions: head (6,3), then (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). And (3,5) removed.\n\n(4,5) was position 17, now last? Positions: 0:(6,3), 1:(6,2), 2:(6,1), 3:(5,1), 4:(4,1), 5:(3,1), 6:(2,1), 7:(2,2), 8:(2,3), 9:(2,4), 10:(3,4), 11:(3,3), 12:(3,2), 13:(4,2), 14:(5,2), 15:(5,3), 16:(4,3), 17:(4,4), 18:(4,5)\n\nTail at (4,5).\n\nNow from (6,3), direction U.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U to (6,4)\n\n- D to (6,2): but (6,2) is position 1, body, collision\n\n- L to (5,3): (5,3) is position 15, body? Position 15 is (5,3), yes body.\n\n- R to (7,3): wall\n\nSo only U to (6,4) possible.\n\nTurn 83: move U to (6,4).\n\nNow at (6,4), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,5), D to (6,3) body, L to (5,4), R to (7,4) wall.\n\n(5,4): is it occupied? Current positions: after move to (6,4), new head (6,4), body (6,3), (6,2), etc., and tail (4,4) removed? Let's see.\n\nAfter move to (6,4): head (6,4), then (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) but (4,4) was tail, removed? Positions: 0:(6,4), 1:(6,3), 2:(6,2), 3:(6,1), 4:(5,1), 5:(4,1), 6:(3,1), 7:(2,1), 8:(2,2), 9:(2,3), 10:(2,4), 11:(3,4), 12:(3,3), 13:(3,2), 14:(4,2), 15:(5,2), 16:(5,3), 17:(4,3), 18:(4,4) — but (4,4) is body, and when moving, if no food, tail is removed, which was (4,4) in previous? Previous tail was (4,5)? I think I messed up.\n\nAfter turn 82 positions: head (6,3), tail (4,5)\n\nAfter moving to (6,4): head to (6,4), then new pos 1: old head (6,3), pos 2: old pos 1 (6,2), ..., up to old pos 17 (4,4)? Old positions after turn 82: 0:(6,3), 1:(6,2), 2:(6,1), 3:(5,1), 4:(4,1), 5:(3,1), 6:(2,1), 7:(2,2), 8:(2,3), 9:(2,4), 10:(3,4), 11:(3,3), 12:(3,2), 13:(4,2), 14:(5,2), 15:(5,3), 16:(4,3), 17:(4,4), 18:(4,5) tail.\n\nMove to (6,4), no food, so new positions: head (6,4), then 1: (6,3), 2: (6,2), 3: (6,1), 4: (5,1), 5: (4,1), 6: (3,1), 7: (2,1), 8: (2,2), 9: (2,3), 10: (2,4), 11: (3,4), 12: (3,3), 13: (3,2), 14: (4,2), 15: (5,2), 16: (5,3), 17: (4,3), 18: (4,4)  // old tail (4,5) removed, new tail (4,4)\n\n(4,4) is now tail.\n\nFrom (6,4), possible moves:\n\n- U to (6,5)\n\n- D to (6,3): but (6,3) is position 1, body, collision\n\n- L to (5,4): (5,4) not in positions? Positions have (5,3), (4,4), etc. (5,4) not listed, so empty.\n\n- R to (7,4) wall\n\nSo U to (6,5) or L to (5,4) possible.\n\nFinally, a choice!\n\nDirection is U, so moving L to (5,4) is not opposite; opposite of U is D, so L is allowed.\n\nSimilarly U is allowed.\n\nD is opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo from (6,4), I can go U to (6,5) or L to (5,4).\n\nNow, I need to think about food and future moves.\n\nFood at (5,5), which is nearby, with life span 3, so on turn 81,82,83 it can be eaten. Turn 81 is current, we're at turn 83 after moves.\n\nCurrent turn 81, we moved U to (6,2) on turn 81.\n\nThen on turn 82, moved U to (6,3).\n\nNow on turn 83, at (6,4), we can move.\n\nTurn 83 is when (5,5) food is still available? Life span 3: exists on turn 81,82,83. After turn 83, gone.\n\nSo on turn 83, I can eat (5,5) if I go to it.\n\n(5,5) is at (5,5), from (6,4), to go to (5,5), I need to move left to (5,4) first? (5,4) is adjacent to (6,4), moving L to (5,4).\n\nThen from (5,4), I can go to (5,5) or other directions.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nAlso, there is food at (2,5) and (1,1), but farther.\n\nFirst, at (6,4), if I move L to (5,4), that is empty, as we said.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (5,5) or other.\n\nBut (5,5) is food, so if I go to (5,5), I eat it, snake grows.\n\nBut let's check if it's safe.\n\nAlso, the obstacle at (4,6), which is above.\n\nNow, long-term, I need to survive and eat food.\n\nSince I have to think 5+ turns ahead, let's plan a path.\n\nFirst, from turn 81: must move U to (6,2)\n\nTurn 82: must move U to (6,3)\n\nTurn 83: at (6,4), I can choose U to (6,5) or L to (5,4)\n\nIf I go L to (5,4), then on turn 83, at (5,4), direction L (since moved left).\n\nThen on turn 84, from (5,4), I can move to (5,5) to eat the food, since (5,5) is adjacent and food.\n\n(5,5) is at (5,5), which is above (5,4)? Coordinates: (x,y), U is y+1, so (5,4) to (5,5) is up.\n\nDirection: if I moved L to (5,4), direction is L, so from (5,4), moving U to (5,5) is not opposite; opposite of L is R, so U and D are perpendicular, allowed.\n\nSimilarly, L to (4,4), but (4,4) is body? Current positions after turn 83 move? Let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, on turn 83, if I move L to (5,4), then positions: from (6,4) to (5,4), head to (5,4), then body: (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), etc., and tail removed.\n\nBut since I moved to (5,4), no food there, so tail removed.\n\n(5,4) is not food, food is at (5,5).\n\nSo after moving to (5,4), new head (5,4), direction L.\n\nPositions: head (5,4), then (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), ..., up to (4,3), tail (4,3) or something.\n\nPrevious after turn 82: at (6,3), positions as before.\n\nAfter turn 83 move to (5,4): head to (5,4), then new pos 1: old head (6,4)? No.\n\nBefore move at turn 83, head at (6,4), positions: let's define state after each turn.\n\nAfter turn 82: head at (6,3), positions: [(6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)] tail (4,5)\n\nOn turn 83, moving to (5,4): (5,4) is not in positions, so empty. Move to (5,4), no food, so new head (5,4), then body: (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)  // tail (4,5) removed, new tail (4,4)\n\n(4,4) is now tail.\n\nNew positions: [(5,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)]\n\nHead at (5,4), direction L (since moved left from (6,4)).\n\nNow on turn 84, from (5,4), possible moves:\n\n- U to (5,5)\n\n- D to (5,3)\n\n- L to (4,4)\n\n- R to (6,4)\n\nBut direction L, so opposite is R, cannot move R to (6,4).\n\nAlso, check body:\n\n(5,5): not in positions, empty\n\n(5,3): is position 16? Positions: 0:(5,4), 1:(6,3), 2:(6,2), 3:(6,1), 4:(5,1), 5:(4,1), 6:(3,1), 7:(2,1), 8:(2,2), 9:(2,3), 10:(2,4), 11:(3,4), 12:(3,3), 13:(3,2), 14:(4,2), 15:(5,2), 16:(5,3), 17:(4,3), 18:(4,4)\n\nSo (5,3) is at index 16, body\n\n(4,4) is index 18, tail, but body\n\n(6,4) is not in positions, but moving R is opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo possible moves:\n\nU to (5,5): empty\n\nD to (5,3): body, collision\n\nL to (4,4): body, since (4,4) is position 18\n\nR to (6,4): but direction L, opposite R, not allowed.\n\nSo only possible move is U to (5,5).\n\nAnd (5,5) has food, so I eat it.\n\nOn turn 84, move U to (5,5), eat food, snake grows, so tail not removed.\n\nNew head (5,5), then body: (5,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), ..., and tail (4,4) not removed, so snake length increases by 1.\n\nNew positions: [(5,5), (5,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)] 20 segments, tail at (4,4).\n\nDirection U.\n\nNow, food at (5,5) eaten, so removed.\n\nOther food: (2,5) at (2,5) with life span 5, so on turn 81 to 85, turn 84 eaten, but (2,5) is not eaten yet.\n\n(1,1) also.\n\nNow, after eating, at (5,5), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,6), D to (5,4) body, L to (4,5), R to (6,5)\n\n(5,6): not wall? y=7 is top wall, so (5,6) is ok, but obstacle at (4,6), but (5,6) is different.\n\n(4,5) is empty? Positions have (4,4), (4,3), etc. (4,5) not listed.\n\n(6,5) not listed.\n\nBut walls: internal obstacle (4,6), but (5,6) is not obstacle.\n\n(4,5) is not wall.\n\nAlso, direction U, so cannot move D (opposite).\n\nSo:\n\n- U to (5,6)\n\n- L to (4,5)\n\n- R to (6,5)\n\nAll possible? But need to check if occupied.\n\n(5,4) is position 1, body, so D to (5,4) invalid.\n\nU to (5,6): empty\n\nL to (4,5): empty\n\nR to (6,5): empty\n\nNo walls.\n\nSo choices.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nAnother option: on turn 83, instead of going L to (5,4), I could go U to (6,5) from (6,4).\n\nLet's see that path.\n\nBack to turn 83 at (6,4): if I go U to (6,5)\n\nThen on turn 83, move to (6,5), no food there, so new head (6,5), body (6,4), (6,3), etc., tail removed.\n\nPositions: head (6,5), then (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), ..., up to (4,4), tail (4,4) after removal.\n\nSimilar to before but at (6,5).\n\nThen from (6,5), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,6), D to (6,4) body, L to (5,5), R to (7,5) wall.\n\n(6,6) empty, (5,5) has food.\n\nSo I can move L to (5,5) to eat food on turn 84.\n\nTurn 84 move to (5,5), eat, grow.\n\nBut on turn 83, if I go to (6,5), I don't eat on turn 83, but on turn 84 I can eat from there.\n\nCompared to going to (5,4) on turn 83, then to (5,5) on turn 84.\n\nIn both cases, I eat (5,5) on turn 84.\n\nBut position is different.\n\nIf I go directly to (5,5) from (6,4) via (5,4), or via (6,5).\n\nBut from (6,4) I cannot go directly to (5,5); it's diagonal, not allowed, only adjacent moves.\n\nSo I have to go to (5,4) or (6,5) first.\n\nNow, eating on turn 84 in both cases.\n\nBut life span: (5,5) can be eaten on turn 83 as well? Turn 81,82,83. On turn 83, if I am at (6,4), I can move to (5,4) but not directly to (5,5). (5,5) is not adjacent to (6,4); adjacent are (6,5), (6,3), (5,4), (7,4).\n\nSo I cannot reach (5,5) from (6,4) in one move; it's not adjacent.\n\nTherefore, I cannot eat (5,5) on turn 83 from (6,4). I can only eat it on turn 84 if I move towards it.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (6,5) on turn 83, then on turn 84 I can go L to (5,5) to eat.\n\nIf I go to (5,4) on turn 83, then on turn 84 go U to (5,5) to eat.\n\nIn both cases, I eat on turn 84.\n\nNow, after eating, in first case, if I went via (5,4), I am at (5,5) with direction U.\n\nIf I went via (6,5), I am at (5,5) with direction L or something.\n\nBut not much difference.\n\nNow, for long-term, I need to consider the other food and the map.\n\nThere is food at (2,5), which is currently under the tail, but tail has moved.\n\nOriginal tail at (2,5), but on turn 81, when I moved U, tail was removed, so (2,5) is now free, and food is there, so it can be eaten if head moves there.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) food.\n\nBut (2,5) life span 5, so until turn 85.\n\nAfter turn 81, on turn 82, (2,5) is free with food.\n\nBut head is far at (6,3) on turn 82, then (6,4) on 83, etc.\n\nTo reach (2,5), it might take many moves.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1).\n\nNow, back to turn 83 decision.\n\nAt (6,4), I can go U to (6,5) or L to (5,4).\n\nIf I go L to (5,4), then to (5,5) on turn 84, eat.\n\nThen at (5,5), I can go U to (5,6), L to (4,5), or R to (6,5).\n\nIf I go U to (6,5) on turn 83, then to (5,5) on turn 84, eat, then at (5,5), I can go U to (5,6), L to (4,5), R to (6,5), same as above.\n\nBut from (5,5), if I go R to (6,5), but (6,5) might be body or not.\n\nAfter eating at (5,5), positions include (6,5) if I came from there, or not.\n\nCase 1: turn 83 go to (5,4), turn 84 go U to (5,5) eat.\n\nAfter: head (5,5), body (5,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), ..., (4,4)\n\n(4,4) is tail.\n\nFrom (5,5), possible moves:\n\nU to (5,6): empty\n\nD to (5,4): body, collision\n\nL to (4,5): empty\n\nR to (6,5): empty\n\nDirection U, so D not allowed anyway.\n\nSo U, L, R possible.\n\nCase 2: turn 83 go U to (6,5), no food, so positions: head (6,5), body (6,4), (6,3), etc., tail (4,4) or something.\n\nAfter turn 83 move to (6,5): from (6,4) to (6,5), new head (6,5), then (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), ..., (4,3), tail (4,3)? Previous tail (4,5) removed, new tail (4,4)? Positions after turn 82: at (6,3), positions as before.\n\nAfter move to (6,5): head (6,5), then 1:(6,4), 2:(6,3), 3:(6,2), 4:(6,1), 5:(5,1), 6:(4,1), 7:(3,1), 8:(2,1), 9:(2,2), 10:(2,3), 11:(2,4), 12:(3,4), 13:(3,3), 14:(3,2), 15:(4,2), 16:(5,2), 17:(5,3), 18:(4,3)  // tail (4,4) removed? Old tail (4,5), so removed, new tail (4,3) or (4,4)? Old positions after turn 82: tail (4,5), after move, new positions: head (6,5), 1:(6,4), 2:(6,3), 3:(6,2), 4:(6,1), 5:(5,1), 6:(4,1), 7:(3,1), 8:(2,1), 9:(2,2), 10:(2,3), 11:(2,4), 12:(3,4), 13:(3,3), 14:(3,2), 15:(4,2), 16:(5,2), 17:(5,3), 18:(4,3)  // since old pos 18 was (4,5)? After turn 82, positions: 0:(6,3), 1:(6,2), 2:(6,1), 3:(5,1), 4:(4,1), 5:(3,1), 6:(2,1), 7:(2,2), 8:(2,3), 9:(2,4), 10:(3,4), 11:(3,3), 12:(3,2), 13:(4,2), 14:(5,2), 15:(5,3), 16:(4,3), 17:(4,4), 18:(4,5)\n\nMove to (6,5), no food, so new: head (6,5), 1:(6,3) old head, 2:(6,2) old1, 3:(6,1) old2, 4:(5,1) old3, 5:(4,1) old4, 6:(3,1) old5, 7:(2,1) old6, 8:(2,2) old7, 9:(2,3) old8, 10:(2,4) old9, 11:(3,4) old10, 12:(3,3) old11, 13:(3,2) old12, 14:(4,2) old13, 15:(5,2) old14, 16:(5,3) old15, 17:(4,3) old16, 18:(4,4) old17  // old tail (4,5) removed, so new tail (4,4)\n\nThen on turn 84, move L to (5,5) to eat.\n\nNew head (5,5), then body: (6,5), (6,3)? New positions: head (5,5), then 1:(6,5), 2:(6,3)? No, body is old head and previous body.\n\nAfter moving to (5,5), eat food, so tail not removed, new positions: head (5,5), then 1: previous head (6,5), 2: previous pos1 (6,4)? From above, after turn 83 at (6,5), positions: 0:(6,5), 1:(6,4), 2:(6,3), 3:(6,2), 4:(6,1), 5:(5,1), 6:(4,1), 7:(3,1), 8:(2,1), 9:(2,2), 10:(2,3), 11:(2,4), 12:(3,4), 13:(3,3), 14:(3,2), 15:(4,2), 16:(5,2), 17:(5,3), 18:(4,3)  // and (4,4) is tail, but not removed since food eaten? When eating, the tail is not removed, so the snake grows.\n\nSo new positions: head (5,5), then 1: (6,5), 2: (6,4), 3: (6,3), 4: (6,2), 5: (6,1), 6: (5,1), 7: (4,1), 8: (3,1), 9: (2,1), 10: (2,2), 11: (2,3), 12: (2,4), 13: (3,4), 14: (3,3), 15: (3,2), 16: (4,2), 17: (5,2), 18: (5,3), 19: (4,3)  // since tail not removed, and (4,3) was last, so new segment added at head, tail is (4,3)\n\nLength 20.\n\nThen from (5,5), direction L (since moved left from (6,5)).\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,6), D to (5,4), L to (4,5), R to (6,5) but (6,5) is body, position 1, collision.\n\nDirection L, so opposite R not allowed.\n\nD to (5,4): not in positions, empty? Positions have (5,3), etc. (5,4) not listed, so empty.\n\nU to (5,6) empty\n\nL to (4,5) empty\n\nR to (6,5) body and not allowed.\n\nSo can move U, D, or L.\n\nBut D to (5,4) is possible.\n\nIn both paths, after eating at (5,5), I have options.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (2,5).\n\n(2,5) has food, and it was tail on turn 81, but after turns, tail moved, so (2,5) is free with food.\n\nLife span 5, so can be eaten until turn 85.\n\nTurn 85 is the last turn it can be eaten.\n\nNow, head is at (5,5) on turn 84 or so.\n\nFrom (5,5) to (2,5), distance is |dx|=3, |dy=0, so at least 3 moves away.\n\nBut with body, it might not be direct.\n\nOn turn 84, if I eat at (5,5), then on turn 85, I can move towards (2,5), but (2,5) is at (2,5), which is same y, x less.\n\nFrom (5,5), I can go L to (4,5), then to (3,5), then to (2,5).\n\n(3,5) and (2,5) might be occupied or not.\n\nBut let's see the positions after eating at (5,5).\n\nIn first case, after eating from (5,4) path, positions: head (5,5), body (5,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n\n(4,4) is tail.\n\nNow (2,5) is not occupied, and has food.\n\nSimilarly, in the other path, similar.\n\nTo reach (2,5) from (5,5), I can go left to (4,5), (3,5), (2,5).\n\n(4,5): is it occupied? In positions, (4,5) not listed, so empty.\n\n(3,5): not listed, empty.\n\n(2,5): empty, food.\n\nBut life span: on turn 85, it can be eaten.\n\nIf I start from (5,5) on turn 84, then turn 85 move to (4,5), turn 86 to (3,5), turn 87 to (2,5).\n\nBut turn 85 is the last for (2,5), since life span 5, disappears after turn 85, so can be eaten on turn 85.\n\nIf I move to (2,5) on turn 85, I eat it.\n\nBut from (5,5) on turn 84, on turn 85 I can only reach (4,5) or (5,6) or (5,4), not (2,5) directly.\n\n(2,5) is 3 cells away, so minimum 3 turns to reach from (5,5).\n\nTurn 84 at (5,5), turn 85 to say (4,5), turn 86 to (3,5), turn 87 to (2,5), but on turn 87, (2,5) food is gone, since life span 5, after turn 85 it disappears.\n\nLife span: for (2,5), value 1, life_span 5.\n\nOn turn 81, it exists, life span decreases each turn.\n\nAfter turn 81, on turn 82, life span 4, turn 83:3, turn 84:2, turn 85:1, after turn 85, gone. So can be eaten on turn 85.\n\nBut on turn 85, I am at, say, (4,5) or something, not at (2,5).\n\nFrom turn 84 at (5,5), on turn 85 I can be at (4,5), which is not (2,5).\n\nSo I cannot reach (2,5) by turn 85; it's too far.\n\nDistance: from (5,5) to (2,5) is |dx|=3, so 3 moves needed, but on turn 85 I can only be at a cell one move away, like (4,5), (5,6), etc., not (2,5).\n\nTherefore, I cannot eat (2,5) because I can't reach it in time.\n\nSimilarly, from earlier positions, on turn 81 head at (6,1), turn 82 at (6,2) or (6,3), still far from (2,5).\n\nOn turn 81, head at (6,1), (2,5) is at distance |dx|=4, |dy|=4, so at least 4 moves, but with obstacles, more.\n\nBut life span 5, turn 81 to 85.\n\nOn turn 81, I am at (6,1), can move to (6,2), then turn 82 to (6,3), turn 83 to (6,4), then turn 84 to (6,5) or (5,4), then turn 85 to somewhere, not (2,5).\n\nMinimum moves to (2,5) from (6,1): for example, left to (5,1) but (5,1) is body, not possible, so I had to go up.\n\nFrom (6,1) only up, to (6,2), then only up to (6,3), etc., so I am going up, away from (2,5).\n\nSo I cannot reach (2,5) by turn 85; it's impossible to eat it.\n\nTherefore, (2,5) food will expire without being eaten.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) has life span 8, so until turn 88, I might reach it later.\n\nBut for now, focus on (5,5) which I can eat on turn 84.\n\nNow, back to turn 83 choice: at (6,4), go U to (6,5) or L to (5,4).\n\nBoth lead to eating (5,5) on turn 84.\n\nBut after eating, I have different positions.\n\nIf I go L to (5,4) on turn 83, then U to (5,5) on turn 84, after that head at (5,5), with body including (5,4) and (6,3) etc.\n\nThen from (5,5), I can go U to (5,6), L to (4,5), or R to (6,5).\n\n(6,5) is empty in this case.\n\nIf I go U to (6,5) on turn 83, then L to (5,5) on turn 84, after that head at (5,5), with body including (6,5) and (6,4) etc., so (6,5) is body, so I cannot move to (6,5) from (5,5) because it's occupied.\n\nBut in that case, from (5,5), R to (6,5) is invalid.\n\nSo in the first path, after eating at (5,5) from (5,4), I have the option to go R to (6,5).\n\nIn the second path, I cannot.\n\nFor long-term, having more options is better.\n\nAlso, there is the obstacle at (4,6), so if I go to (5,6), it might be risky.\n\nBut (4,6) is wall, so I cannot go there.\n\nNow, the other food (1,1) at (1,1), life span 8, so I can plan to eat it later.\n\nAfter eating (5,5), I can head towards (1,1).\n\n(1,1) is bottom-left.\n\nCurrent position after turn 84 at (5,5), I can move down and left.\n\nBut need to avoid walls and body.\n\nAlso, the body is long, 20 segments, so space might be tight.\n\nBut the grid is 8x8, minus walls, but borders are walls, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? x from 1 to 6? Walls x=0,7 y=0,7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6)? (1,1) to (6,6) is 6x6, but walls at x=0,7 y=0,7, so valid cells are x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? Let's see.\n\nFor example, (1,1) is a cell, and not wall, so yes, x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except internal obstacle (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is wall, so (4,6) is invalid.\n\nSo cells: x=1,2,3,4,5,6; y=1,2,3,4,5,6, but (4,6) is wall, so not accessible.\n\n(4,6) is occupied by wall, so cannot go there.\n\nSimilarly, other cells ok.\n\nNow, for turn 83, which move to choose.\n\nIf I go L to (5,4) on turn 83, then on turn 84 go U to (5,5) eat, then on turn 85 from (5,5) I can go L to (4,5) or U to (5,6) or R to (6,5).\n\nIf I go U to (6,5) on turn 83, then on turn 84 go L to (5,5) eat, then on turn 85 from (5,5) I can go U to (5,6), L to (4,5), or D to (5,4), since in this case (5,4) might be empty or not.\n\nIn the second path, after turn 84, at (5,5), positions include (5,4)? In the U to (6,5) path: after eating at (5,5), positions: head (5,5), body (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), etc., so (5,4) is not body, empty.\n\nFrom (5,5), I can go D to (5,4), U to (5,6), L to (4,5), but not R to (6,5) because it's body.\n\nSo in both cases, I can go to (4,5), (5,6), or in first case R to (6,5), in second case D to (5,4).\n\n(5,4) is near the bottom, (6,5) is right-top.\n\nNow, to reach (1,1), going left and down might be better.\n\nBut let's see the body.\n\nPerhaps I should go for (5,4) on turn 83 to be closer to the left side.\n\nBut (5,4) is at y=4, x=5, (1,1) at x=1,y=1.\n\nFrom (5,5), going to (4,5) then (3,5), etc. down to (1,1).\n\nBut (3,5) might be body or not.\n\nAfter turn 84 at (5,5), in first path: positions include (2,1) to (2,4), (3,2) to (3,4), (4,2) to (4,4), (5,1) to (5,4), (6,1) to (6,3), etc.\n\nSpecifically, (3,5) not occupied, (4,5) not, etc.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) not occupied.\n\nSo I can move left to (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), but (2,5) has food, but it expired on turn 85, so on turn 85, (2,5) food is gone, since after turn 85 it disappears.\n\nOn turn 85, (2,5) can be eaten if I am there, but I can't be.\n\nAfter turn 85, no food at (2,5).\n\nSo (2,5) is just an empty cell now.\n\nFor (1,1), life span 8, turn 81 to 88.\n\nOn turn 84 at (5,5), I have 4 turns to reach (1,1), which is possible.\n\nFor example, from (5,5) to (4,5) to (3,5) to (2,5) to (1,5) to (1,4) to (1,3) to (1,2) to (1,1), but that's 7 moves, too many.\n\nShorter path: from (5,5) go L to (4,5), then D to (4,4) but (4,4) may be body, in positions, (4,4) is body in first path.\n\nIn the (5,4) path after eating, (4,4) is tail.\n\nSo I can go to (4,5), then to (4,4) is body, collision.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can go D to (4,4) if not body, but it is, or L to (3,5), etc.\n\nBut to go down, I need to go to y=1.\n\nPerhaps from (5,5) go D to (5,4) if possible, but in some cases it is.\n\nBut let's not optimize yet.\n\nFor turn 83, since both options allow eating (5,5) on turn 84, and the difference is small, I can choose one.\n\nBut to have more space, going L to (5,4) on turn 83 might be better because it keeps me closer to the center or left.\n\nGoing U to (6,5) is more to the right.\n\nBut the food (1,1) is left-bottom, so going left might be better for future.\n\nAlso, there is the internal obstacle at (4,6), so going up might be riskier if I go near (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is ok, but (4,6) is wall, so from (5,6) I can only go left, right, or down, not up to (5,7) wall.\n\ny=7 wall.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) etc.\n\nBut for now, on turn 83, I think I should move L to (5,4) to be closer to (5,5) and left side.\n\nThen on turn 84 move U to (5,5) eat.\n\nThen on turn 85, from (5,5) move L to (4,5) to start heading left.\n\nThen later down to (1,1).\n\nBut I need to output moves for multiple turns.\n\nThe answer format is to list actions for several turns, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output for current and future, but how many?\n\nThe format is \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to specify for a few turns, but it doesn't say how many; probably until a decision point or 5 turns.\n\nSince on turn 81 and 82 only one choice, on turn 83 a choice.\n\nSo for turn 81: U\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nTurn 83: I need to decide.\n\nLet's list the moves.\n\nAlso, for the food at (1,1), I can eat it later.\n\nAnother thing: the \"Tail Reward Danger\" but not applicable now.\n\nSo for turn 83, I'll choose to move L to (5,4).\n\nThen turn 84 U to (5,5)\n\nThen from there, I can go to (4,5) on turn 85.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nFirst, turn 81: move U\n\nTurn 82: move U\n\nTurn 83: move L\n\nTurn 84: move U to (5,5) eat food.\n\nThen for turn 85, at (5,5), direction U, I can move L to (4,5)\n\nBut I need to output only for the current state, and the answer should start from turn 81.\n\nThe current turn is 81, so I need to output actions for turn 81, 82, 83, etc.\n\nBut since after turn 84 there are choices, I can stop or continue.\n\nPerhaps output for 5 turns: turn 81 to 85.\n\nTurn 81,82,83,84,85.\n\nOn turn 85, depending on position.\n\nBut in this plan, on turn 85, at (5,5) after eating, or if I move, at (4,5).\n\nLet's specify.\n\nSo for turn 81: U\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nTurn 83: L (to (5,4))\n\nTurn 84: U (to (5,5), eat)\n\nThen on turn 85, from (5,5), move L to (4,5)\n\nDirection after turn 84 is U, so moving L to (4,5) is allowed.\n\nThen positions after turn 85: head to (4,5), no food, so tail removed, etc.\n\nBut (4,5) might have food? No, food is at (1,1) and expired (2,5), (5,5) eaten.\n\n(1,1) still there.\n\nBut for output, I can list up to turn 85.\n\nSince thinking 5 turns ahead, from turn 81, turns 81 to 86 or so.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nPerhaps for the answer, I can list the moves for the immediate turns.\n\nAnother thing: on turn 83, if I go U to (6,5), it might be similar.\n\nBut I think L is fine.\n\nTo maximize score, I ate one food, and can go for (1,1).\n\nBut (1,1) is far, so I need to survive.\n\nNow, for the internal obstacle, (4,6) is wall, so I should avoid going to (5,6) if possible, but it's ok.\n\nI think for turn 83, moving L to (5,4) is reasonable.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 81: U\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nTurn 83: L\n\nTurn 84: U\n\nThen for turn 85, I can say L to (4,5), but I need to include it or not.\n\nThe answer format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I should list a sequence.\n\nSince on turn 85 there might be choices, but I can decide.\n\nPerhaps list until turn 84 or 85.\n\nLet's count the turns.\n\nTurn 81: move U to (6,2)\n\nTurn 82: move U to (6,3)\n\nTurn 83: move L to (5,4)\n\nTurn 84: move U to (5,5) eat\n\nThen turn 85: from (5,5), move L to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 86: from (4,5), I can move L to (3,5) or D to (4,4) but (4,4) body, etc.\n\nBut for output, I can stop at turn 84 or 85.\n\nSince the state is given for turn 81, and I need to output actions starting turn 81.\n\nI think I should output for turn 81 to, say, turn 85.\n\n5 turns: 81,82,83,84,85.\n\nOn turn 85, move L to (4,5).\n\nIn the positions, after turn 84, (4,5) is empty, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, direction is U, moving L is fine.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 81: U\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nTurn 83: L\n\nTurn 84: U\n\nTurn 85: L\n\nBut on turn 85, I move to (4,5), which is not food, so no score, but it's part of the path.\n\nI could output fewer turns, but 5 turns is ok.\n\nSince turn 81 and 82 are fixed, I can start from there.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (1,1), I can eat it later, but for now, this is fine.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 81):**\n- **Snake Position**: Head at (6,1), moving right (R). The snake has 19 segments, forming a complex body shape primarily in the bottom-left to center-right area of the grid.\n- **Walls**: Borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (4,6). Playable area is cells (x,y) with 1 ≤ x ≤ 6 and 1 ≤ y ≤ 6, except (4,6) is blocked.\n- **Food**:\n  - (5,5): Value +1, life span 3 (disappears after turn 83).\n  - (2,5): Value +1, life span 5 (disappears after turn 85).\n  - (1,1): Value +1, life span 8 (disappears after turn 88).\n- **Constraints**: \n  - Current head direction is R, so instant reverse to L is not allowed on turn 81.\n  - From (6,1), possible moves are U (up to (6,2)), D (down to (6,0), invalid wall), L (left to (5,1), invalid reverse), R (right to (7,1), invalid wall). Only U to (6,2) is safe and valid.\n- **Risks and Opportunities**:\n  - (2,5) food is under the tail but cannot be reached before it expires (turn 85) due to distance and body constraints; ignore it.\n  - (5,5) food can be eaten by turn 84 if the snake moves towards it.\n  - (1,1) food has a longer life span; plan to eat it after turn 85 for long-term score.\n  - Internal obstacle at (4,6) limits upward movement; avoid trapping near y=6.\n\n**5+ Turn Lookahead Strategy:**\n- **Turn 81**: Must move U to (6,2) (only valid move).\n- **Turn 82**: From (6,2), direction U, only U to (6,3) is valid (other moves cause collisions or walls).\n- **Turn 83**: From (6,3), direction U, move to (6,4). Then from (6,4), direction U, possible moves are U to (6,5) or L to (5,4). Choose L to (5,4) to:\n  - Position closer to (5,5) for eating on turn 84.\n  - Avoid the risky area near (4,6) obstacle by not going up to (6,5).\n  - Start heading left toward (1,1) for future food.\n- **Turn 84**: From (5,4), direction L, move U to (5,5) to eat the food (+1 score, snake grows to 20 segments).\n- **Turn 85**: From (5,5), direction U, move L to (4,5) to continue toward (1,1) food. This is safe and opens paths for long-term survival.\n- **Beyond Turn 85**: Head to (1,1) via (4,5) → (3,5) → (2,5) → (1,5) → (1,4) → (1,3) → (1,2) → (1,1), eating (1,1) by turn 88. Prioritize open spaces to avoid self-collision.\n\n**Key Decisions:**\n- Eating (5,5) on turn 84 is prioritized as it expires soon and is reachable.\n- (2,5) is unreachable by turn 85; no detour needed.\n- Long-term survival: After eating (5,5), the snake has ample space; move left/down to (1,1) while avoiding body collisions.\n\n### Answer\nThe actions for turns 81 to 85 are determined based on the 5+ turn lookahead, ensuring immediate survival and maximizing score by eating (5,5) while setting up for (1,1).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 81: U\nTurn 82: U\nTurn 83: L\nTurn 84: U\nTurn 85: L\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 82, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: Head at (6,2), and the body segments follow. The snake is long; let me count the positions: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5). That's 19 segments. So the snake is 19 cells long.\n\nHead direction is Up, which means it was moving upwards to (6,2) from (6,1), I assume. Since head direction is U, and it's at (6,2), moving up would go to (6,3), but let's confirm the positions.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (5,5) with value 1, life span 2 (so it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 82, life span 2 means it will disappear after turn 83? Let me read: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So if life span is N at turn t, it will be gone at turn t + N - 1? I need to be careful.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\" So if at turn t, a food has life span L, after turn t, it decreases to L-1, and so on. When life span reaches 0, it disappears. So for a food with life span L at turn t, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it can be eaten up to and including turn t + L - 1? Let's think.\n\nIf life span is L at turn t, then:\n\n- At turn t: life span = L\n\n- After turn t, before turn t+1: life span becomes L-1\n\n- So at the start of turn t+1, life span is L-1\n\n- It disappears when life span reaches 0, so after turn t + L - 1, it should be gone? For example, if L=2 at turn 82, then:\n\n- Turn 82: life span 2\n\n- After turn 82, life span decreases to 1\n\n- Turn 83: life span 1\n\n- After turn 83, life span decreases to 0, so it disappears before turn 84.\n\nSo it can be eaten on turn 82 or 83.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFoods:\n\n1. (5,5): value +1, life span 2 (so can be eaten on turn 82 or 83)\n\n2. (2,5): value +1, life span 4 (can be eaten turns 82,83,84,85)\n\n3. (1,1): value +1, life span 7 (turns 82 to 88)\n\n4. (4,4): value +1, life span 10 (turns 82 to 91)\n\nAll are positive food, no negative food here.\n\nNow, the snake head is at (6,2), direction Up. So from (6,2), moving Up would go to (6,3).\n\nBut I need to consider possible moves: U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse. Since current direction is U, reverse is D, so I cannot move Down next. So possible moves: U, L, R. (Up, Left, Right)\n\nNow, let's map out the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, but walls at borders, so cells outside 1-6 in x or y are walls.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), so (4,6) is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: List them to see where the body is.\n\nHead: (6,2)\n\nThen: (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)\n\nThat's 19 positions.\n\nNow, let's find which cells are occupied by snake.\n\nAlso, food at (5,5), (2,5), (1,1), (4,4)\n\n(4,4) has food, but is it occupied by snake? Snake positions include (4,4)? Let's see: positions: ... (4,4), (4,5), (3,5) — yes, (4,4) is part of the snake body.\n\nFood can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) has food, but snake body is there, so it can be eaten only if that segment moves away.\n\nNow, current head position (6,2), direction U.\n\nPossible actions: U, L, R (since D is reverse, not allowed)\n\n- U: to (6,3)\n\n- L: to (5,2)\n\n- R: to (7,2) — but x=7 is wall, so invalid. x=7 is border wall, so (7,2) is out of bounds, wall, cannot move there.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 and y=7 walls, but (6,2) y=2, U to y=3, D to y=1 but D not allowed.\n\nL: to (5,2) — is (5,2) occupied? Snake positions: (5,2) is in the list, it's a body segment.\n\nR: to (7,2) — wall, invalid.\n\nU: to (6,3) — is (6,3) occupied or wall?\n\n(6,3): not in snake positions, and not wall. x=6,y=3 should be within 1-6, yes.\n\nWalls: x=0,7; y=0,7. So (6,3) is fine.\n\nBut is it occupied? Snake positions: let's list all:\n\n(6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)\n\n(6,3) not listed, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) is listed, so occupied.\n\nSo from (6,2):\n\n- U to (6,3): possible, no wall, not occupied\n\n- D: reverse, not allowed\n\n- L to (5,2): but (5,2) is occupied by body, so if I move there, head collides with body, death.\n\n- R to (7,2): wall, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is Up to (6,3).\n\nBut is that right? L to (5,2) is occupied, so yes, collision.\n\nBut in snake movement, when you move, the head moves to new position, and the tail moves forward, so if you move into the tail cell, it might be ok if the tail moves away.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, when you move, if the head moves to a cell that will be vacated by the tail, it's ok, because tail moves, so no collision.\n\nIn this case, the tail is at (3,5). If I move, the tail will move to the next segment.\n\nBut for the move itself, at the moment of moving, if the head moves to a cell occupied by a body segment that is not the tail, it collides.\n\nSpecifically, you can move to the tail cell because tail moves away.\n\nLet's see the positions: head at (6,2), tail at (3,5).\n\nNow, possible moves:\n\n- Move U to (6,3): not occupied, safe.\n\n- Move L to (5,2): now, (5,2) is occupied by a body segment. Is it the tail? Tail is (3,5), so (5,2) is not tail, it's a middle segment. So if head moves to (5,2), it collides with the body there, death.\n\n- Move R to (7,2): wall, death.\n\n- Move D to (6,1): but (6,1) is occupied by body, and it's not tail; tail is (3,5). Also, D is reverse, not allowed anyway.\n\nSo indeed, only possible move is Up to (6,3).\n\nBut that can't be right for the game; probably I need to think ahead.\n\nPerhaps I can move left or right, but from above, only up is possible without immediate death.\n\nBut let's confirm the snake positions.\n\nList the positions in order:\n\nHead: (6,2)\n\nThen: (6,1) -- segment 1\n\n(5,1) -- seg 2\n\n(4,1) -- seg 3\n\n(3,1) -- seg 4\n\n(2,1) -- seg 5\n\n(2,2) -- seg 6\n\n(2,3) -- seg 7\n\n(2,4) -- seg 8\n\n(3,4) -- seg 9\n\n(3,3) -- seg 10? Positions: after (2,4) is (3,4), then (3,3), then (3,2), then (4,2), then (5,2), then (5,3), then (4,3), then (4,4), then (4,5), then (3,5)\n\nSo (5,2) is segment, let's index:\n\n0: head (6,2)\n\n1: (6,1)\n\n2: (5,1)\n\n3: (4,1)\n\n4: (3,1)\n\n5: (2,1)\n\n6: (2,2)\n\n7: (2,3)\n\n8: (2,4)\n\n9: (3,4)\n\n10: (3,3)\n\n11: (3,2)\n\n12: (4,2)\n\n13: (5,2)\n\n14: (5,3)\n\n15: (4,3)\n\n16: (4,4)\n\n17: (4,5)\n\n18: tail (3,5)\n\nSo (5,2) is segment 13, not tail.\n\nIf head moves to (5,2), it would be on a body segment, collision.\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) is segment 1, also body.\n\nOnly (6,3) is free.\n\nBut is there a way to move to the tail? Tail is at (3,5), far away.\n\nSo for this turn, only possible move is Up to (6,3).\n\nBut then, after moving, the snake will have head at (6,3), and tail moves to (6,1)? When head moves to new position, the tail is removed, so positions shift.\n\nAfter move U to (6,3), new positions: head (6,3), then previous head (6,2) becomes body, so (6,2), then (6,1), (5,1), ..., up to (4,5), and tail (3,5) is removed, so the new tail is the previous segment before tail, which was (4,5), but (4,5) was segment 17, after tail removed, (4,5) becomes tail.\n\nLet's list new positions after moving U:\n\nHead at (6,3)\n\nThen body: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)  -- and (3,5) is gone, so 18 segments now? Original 19, after move, head new, tail removed, so 19 - 1 + 0 = 18 segments, since no food eaten.\n\nLength unchanged.\n\nBut we need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nPerhaps there is a food that can be eaten, but currently only move is U.\n\nBut let's see the food.\n\nFood at (5,5), (2,5), (1,1), (4,4)\n\n(4,4) is occupied by snake, so can be eaten only if snake moves away from it.\n\nCurrently, (4,4) is segment 16, so if that part moves, it might be accessible.\n\nBut for now, at turn 82, only possible action is U to (6,3).\n\nThen, on turn 83, head at (6,3), direction U (since we moved U).\n\nThen possible moves: U to (6,4), D to (6,2) but D is reverse, not allowed, L to (5,3), R to (7,3) wall.\n\nL to (5,3): (5,3) is segment 14 in previous, but after move, positions: head (6,3), body (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), ..., (5,3) is still there? Let's list after turn 82 move:\n\nPositions: head (6,3), then (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)  -- (4,5) is tail.\n\n(5,3) is a body segment.\n\nAt turn 83, head at (6,3), direction U.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U to (6,4): free? Not in positions, no wall, so possible.\n\n- D to (6,2): reverse, not allowed.\n\n- L to (5,3): (5,3) is occupied by body (segment 15 or something), not tail, so collision if move there.\n\n- R to (7,3): wall, invalid.\n\nSo only U to (6,4) possible.\n\nThen turn 84, head at (6,4), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,5), D to (6,3) reverse not allowed, L to (5,4), R to (7,4) wall.\n\n(5,4): is it occupied? Not in current positions, so free? Let's see positions after turn 83 move.\n\nAfter turn 83 move U to (6,4): head (6,4), then (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)  -- tail is (4,4) now? (4,4) was segment, but after tail removed, (4,4) might be tail.\n\nPrevious positions before turn 83: head (6,3), body (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nAfter move U to (6,4): head to (6,4), add new head, remove tail (4,5), so new positions: (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)  -- (4,4) is now the tail.\n\n(5,4) is not occupied, so at turn 84, head (6,4), direction U, can move:\n\nU to (6,5): free\n\nL to (5,4): free\n\nD not allowed, R wall.\n\nSo two choices.\n\nBut we have food at (5,5), which is close.\n\n(5,5) has life span 2, so at turn 82, life span 2, can be eaten turn 82 or 83. But on turn 82, we couldn't reach it, only moved to (6,3). On turn 83, we moved to (6,4), still not at (5,5). On turn 84, from (6,4), we can move L to (5,4), then to (5,5) on turn 85, but food (5,5) disappears after turn 83? Let's see life span.\n\nAt turn 82, food (5,5) life span 2.\n\nAfter turn 82, life span decreases to 1.\n\nAt turn 83, life span 1, can be eaten.\n\nAfter turn 83, life span decreases to 0, disappears before turn 84.\n\nSo (5,5) can only be eaten on turn 82 or 83.\n\nTurn 82: head at (6,2), cannot reach (5,5) in one move; distance is |6-5| + |2-5| =1+3=4, too far.\n\nTurn 83: after moving to (6,3), head at (6,3), to (5,5) is |6-5| + |3-5| =1+2=3, still not adjacent, cannot reach in one move. So impossible to eat (5,5), it will disappear unused.\n\nSimilarly, other foods.\n\nBut at turn 84, from (6,4), we can move to (5,4) or (6,5).\n\nBut let's think about the overall situation.\n\nThe snake is very long and the board is small, 6x6 playable area with obstacle at (4,6), so 35 cells, snake is 19, so many cells occupied.\n\nFood at (2,5), life span 4, so can be eaten turns 82,83,84,85.\n\n(1,1) life span 7, turns 82-88.\n\n(4,4) life span 10, but occupied by snake, so need to move away.\n\n(4,4) has food, and it's currently occupied by the snake body. In the positions, at turn 82, (4,4) is segment 16, not head or tail.\n\nAs the snake moves, when the body moves away from (4,4), the food can be eaten if head moves there.\n\nBut we need to plan a path.\n\nFirst, for turn 82, only possible move is U to (6,3), as we established.\n\nThen turn 83, from (6,3), only move U to (6,4), as above.\n\nThen turn 84, from (6,4), head at (6,4), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,5), or L to (5,4).\n\nR to (7,4) wall, D reverse not allowed.\n\n(6,5) is free, (5,4) is free.\n\nNow, if we move U to (6,5), then from there, we can go to (6,6) but y=6, is it wall? y=7 is wall, y=6 is border? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to y=6 are playable? Let's see: \"Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" So cells with x=0,7 or y=0,7 are walls. So playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\n(6,6) is playable, but there is an internal obstacle at (4,6), so (4,6) is blocked.\n\n(6,6) is not blocked, so it's free.\n\nFrom (6,4), if move U to (6,5), then head at (6,5).\n\nThen possible moves: U to (6,6), D to (6,4) but D is reverse of U, not allowed if we just moved U, so only L or R or U? Direction is U, so can move U, L, R.\n\nU to (6,6), L to (5,5), R to (7,5) wall.\n\n(5,5) has food, but it disappears after turn 83, so at turn 84, it's gone. Life span: at turn 82, life span 2, after turn 82 to 1, after turn 83 to 0, gone before turn 84. So at turn 84, no food at (5,5).\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) is free.\n\nBut from (6,5), move U to (6,6), then from (6,6), possible moves: D to (6,5) reverse not allowed, L to (5,6), R wall.\n\n(5,6) is free? But internal obstacle at (4,6), so (5,6) is ok.\n\nThen to (5,6), etc.\n\nBut let's not get ahead; we need to think for turn 84.\n\nBack to turn 84 from (6,4): choices U to (6,5) or L to (5,4).\n\nIf we move L to (5,4), then head at (5,4), direction L (since we moved left from previous up, so new direction is L).\n\nThen from there, we can go to food or something.\n\nFood at (2,5) is available.\n\n(2,5) is not occupied, I think. Snake positions: at turn 82, (2,5) not in list, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) free.\n\n(4,4) occupied.\n\nFrom (5,4), we can move towards (2,5) or other.\n\nBut let's think about the tail reward danger.\n\nThere is food at (4,4), which is on the body. When the snake moves, the body at (4,4) will move at some point.\n\nFor example, the segment at (4,4) is part of the body, and as the snake moves, it will be vacated.\n\nBut we need to plan to have the head move there when it's free.\n\nAlso, the tail is at (3,5), which has no food, I think.\n\nFood at (4,4) is on the body.\n\nLet's list the positions again to see the shape.\n\nSnake positions: head (6,2), then down to (6,1), left to (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), then up to (2,2)? From (2,1) to (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), then right to (3,4), down to (3,3), left to (3,2)? (3,3) to (3,2), then right to (4,2), (5,2), up to (5,3), left to (4,3), up to (4,4), right to (4,5), up to (3,5) tail.\n\nSo the snake is coiled, and (4,4) is a bend point.\n\nWhen the snake moves, for example, if we move up from (6,2), to (6,3), then (6,4), etc., the tail will move, and eventually (4,4) might be vacated.\n\nBut at turn 82, (4,4) is occupied, so food there cannot be eaten yet.\n\nSimilarly, for turn 82, only move is U to (6,3).\n\nI think for turn 82, we have no choice but to move U.\n\nThen for turn 83, from (6,3), only move U to (6,4).\n\nThen turn 84, from (6,4), we have choices: U to (6,5) or L to (5,4).\n\nNow, let's consider the food at (2,5), which is at (2,5), value +1, life span 4, so can be eaten on turns 82,83,84,85.\n\nAt turn 84, head at (6,4), to (2,5) is far, |6-2| + |4-5| =4+1=5, so not reachable in one move, but we can plan a path.\n\nAlso, there is food at (1,1), life span 7, and (4,4) life span 10.\n\nBut (4,4) is occupied, so we need to free it first.\n\nFirst, for turn 82: must move U.\n\nTurn 83: must move U to (6,4).\n\nTurn 84: from (6,4), we can choose.\n\nIf we move U to (6,5), then we are going up, and (6,6) is available, but then we might be cornered.\n\nIf we move L to (5,4), then we can go towards the center.\n\nAlso, at (5,4), we are closer to (2,5) or other foods.\n\nMoreover, there is a danger at (4,4): if the head is adjacent to the tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut currently, tail is at (3,5), and food at (4,4) is not on tail, it's on body.\n\nThe rule is for tail cell having food.\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nSo it's specifically when the tail cell has food and head is adjacent.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (3,5), and there is no food at (3,5), so no danger now.\n\nFood at (4,4) is on body, not tail.\n\nSo for now, no such danger.\n\nBack to turn 84.\n\nFrom (6,4), if we move L to (5,4), then head at (5,4), direction L.\n\nThen possible moves: from (5,4), direction L, so can move L, U, D (not R, reverse).\n\nL to (4,4): but (4,4) is occupied by body. Is it the tail? At turn 84, after previous moves.\n\nLet's track positions.\n\nAt turn 82 start: positions as given.\n\nAfter turn 82 move U: head to (6,3), tail (3,5) removed, so new tail is (4,5)? Positions: head (6,3), body (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), and (4,5) is removed, so tail is (4,4)? No.\n\nPrevious positions: head (6,2), then (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5)\n\nAfter move U to (6,3): new head (6,3), then the body: previous positions except tail removed, so: (6,3) new head, then (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)  -- and (3,5) removed, so new tail is (4,5).\n\nPositions: (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)  -- 19 segments? Head new, tail removed, but no food, so length same, 19 segments? Original 19, remove tail, add head, so 19 cells.\n\nBut (4,5) is the tail.\n\nAt turn 83, head at (6,3), move U to (6,4): new head (6,4), then body: (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), and tail (4,5) removed, so new tail is (4,4)? Positions: new head (6,4), then (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)  -- and (4,5) removed, so tail is (4,4).\n\n(4,4) is now the tail, and it has food! Food at (4,4) is still there, and now it's the tail cell.\n\nAt turn 83, after move, positions have (4,4) as tail.\n\nFood at (4,4) has life span 10, so it can be eaten.\n\nBut the head is at (6,4), not adjacent to tail (4,4). Distance |6-4| + |4-4| =2+0=2, not adjacent.\n\nAdjacent would be one cell away: (3,4), (5,4), (4,3), (4,5), but (4,5) is not playable or something, but (4,5) was tail but removed.\n\nFrom head (6,4), adjacent cells: (6,5), (6,3), (5,4), (7,4) wall.\n\nTail at (4,4), adjacent: (3,4), (5,4), (4,3), (4,5).\n\n(5,4) is adjacent to both, but not the same cell.\n\nHead at (6,4), tail at (4,4), not adjacent.\n\nAt turn 84, head at (6,4), direction U.\n\nIf we move L to (5,4), then head moves to (5,4).\n\n(5,4) is adjacent to tail (4,4)? (5,4) and (4,4) are adjacent, yes.\n\nAnd tail cell (4,4) has positive food.\n\nIf we move to (5,4), we are not eating the food; we are moving to (5,4), not to (4,4).\n\nTo eat the food, we need to move the head to (4,4).\n\nBut if we move to (4,4), it is occupied by tail, but we can move to tail cell because tail moves away.\n\nBut in this case, if we move to (4,4), we eat the food, snake grows, so tail does not move, and new segment added.\n\nBut there is tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it causes collision.\n\nHere, at turn 84, head at (6,4), tail at (4,4), not adjacent.\n\nIf we move to (5,4), then head at (5,4), tail at (4,4), now they are adjacent.\n\nAnd tail cell (4,4) has food.\n\nBut we didn't eat it; we just moved to (5,4).\n\nThen, on next turn, if we move to (4,4), we would eat the food.\n\nBut at that point, head is at (5,4), adjacent to tail (4,4), and tail cell has food, so if we eat it, head moves to (4,4), food eaten, snake grows, so the tail does not move, and the new head is at (4,4), but the previous tail was at (4,4), which is now the new head, and since snake grows, the tail stays, so the segment that was tail is now body, and new head on it, but collision? Let's think.\n\nRule: \"because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nWhen you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail does not move, so the snake grows by one cell.\n\nSo if the food is on the tail cell, and head moves there, it's like adding a new segment at the tail position, but since the tail was there, and head moves to it, it might be ok if the tail doesn't move, but the rule says it causes collision because the new head and the new tail position.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat, head moves to food, tail stays, so length increases by one.\n\nIf the food is on the current tail, and head moves to it, then the new snake has head at previous tail, and the tail is the same as before, but since it grew, the tail didn't move, so the cell is occupied by head and the old tail segment is now the second last, so no collision, I think. But the rule specifically says it kills the snake.\n\nLet's read: \"eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nPerhaps because after eating, the head is at the food cell, and the new tail is the old tail, but since the head moved to the tail cell, and the tail is still there, but in the new position, the head is at (4,4), and the tail is at (4,4) for a moment? No.\n\nWhen head moves to food cell, it occupies that cell, and the tail does not move, so the cell that was tail is now occupied by the new head, and the old tail segment is still there, but it becomes the second last segment, so the tail cell is now the new head, and the new tail is the previous segment.\n\nFor example: suppose tail at T, and head moves to T to eat food. Then new head at T, and the segment that was at T is now the new head, and the previous segment before tail is now the tail. So no collision; it should be fine. But the rule says it causes collision, so I think there might be a misunderstanding.\n\nThe rule: \"because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nPerhaps it means that after eating, the head is at the food cell, and since the snake grew, the tail is still, but if the head was adjacent before moving, after eating, the new head is at the tail cell, and the new tail is the previous tail's predecessor, which might be adjacent or not.\n\nBut in the case where head is adjacent to tail and eats the tail food, after moving, the new head is at the former tail position, and the new tail is the segment that was adjacent to the old tail, so if they were adjacent, the new head and new tail might not be adjacent, but the rule says they collide, so perhaps it's considered that the head and the new tail occupy the same cell or something, but that doesn't happen.\n\nI think I need to trust the rule as given.\n\nThe rule states: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake\"\n\nSo in this situation, if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, then moving head to tail cell to eat the food causes death.\n\nIn our case, at turn 84, if we move to (5,4), then head at (5,4), tail at (4,4), they are adjacent, and tail cell (4,4) has food. So if on next turn we move to (4,4), we die.\n\nBut we don't have to move to (4,4); we can move elsewhere.\n\nFor turn 84, from (6,4), if we move L to (5,4), we become adjacent to tail with food on tail cell, so it's dangerous to eat it next turn.\n\nIf we move U to (6,5), we avoid that.\n\nThen from (6,5), we can move U to (6,6) or L to (5,5), but (5,5) food is gone.\n\n(5,5) is gone after turn 83.\n\nAt turn 84, no food at (5,5).\n\nSo from (6,5), move U to (6,6) or L to (5,5).\n\n(5,5) is free.\n\nThen from (6,6), move L to (5,6), etc.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (2,5).\n\n(2,5) life span 4, at turn 82, 83, 84, 85.\n\nTurn 82 and 83 passed, head not close.\n\nAt turn 84, head at (6,4), (2,5) is at distance 4, so if we move towards it, we might reach by turn 85 or 86, but life span 4, can be eaten up to turn 85.\n\nTurn 84: head at (6,4)\n\nTo reach (2,5), we need to go left and down, but it's far.\n\nFor example, from (6,4) move L to (5,4), then from (5,4) move L to (4,4), but (4,4) is tail with food, and if we move to (4,4), we eat it, but since head at (5,4) is adjacent to tail (4,4), if we move to (4,4), we die because of tail reward danger.\n\nIf from (5,4) we move elsewhere, say U to (5,5), but (5,5) no food, or D to (5,3), etc.\n\nBut let's list the positions at turn 84.\n\nAt turn 84 start: head at (6,4), body: (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), tail (4,4)\n\nFood at (4,4) is on tail.\n\nIf we move L to (5,4) from (6,4), then new head at (5,4), new body: (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), and tail (4,4) removed? No.\n\nAfter move L to (5,4): new head (5,4), then body: (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), and tail (4,4) is removed, so new tail is (4,3)? Positions: new head (5,4), then (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3)  -- and (4,4) removed, so tail is (4,3).\n\nAnd the food at (4,4) is still there, but (4,4) is now free, since tail moved away.\n\nAfter moving, the cell (4,4) is vacated, so food is there and can be eaten.\n\nBut at this point, head is at (5,4), and (4,4) is adjacent, and has food.\n\nIf we move to (4,4) next turn, we can eat it.\n\nBut are head and tail adjacent? Tail is now at (4,3), head at (5,4), not adjacent. |5-4| + |4-3| =1+1=2, not adjacent.\n\nSo no tail reward danger.\n\nSimilarly, the tail cell is (4,3), no food on it.\n\nSo from (5,4), we can move to (4,4) to eat the food, or to other places.\n\nBut let's not get too detailed.\n\nFor turn 82, we must move U.\n\nFor turn 83, must move U.\n\nFor turn 84, we have a choice.\n\nSince we need to think 5+ turns ahead, let's consider the options.\n\nOption 1: at turn 84, move U to (6,5)\n\nThen head at (6,5), direction U.\n\nThen turn 85: from (6,5), can move U to (6,6) or L to (5,5) (R wall, D reverse not allowed).\n\n(6,6) free, (5,5) free but no food.\n\nSay move U to (6,6), then head at (6,6), direction U.\n\nThen turn 86: from (6,6), can move L to (5,6) (D reverse not allowed, R wall, U to (6,7) wall).\n\n(5,6) free, but internal obstacle at (4,6), so (5,6) ok.\n\nThen to (5,6), etc.\n\nBut this is going to the top-right corner, might be risky as snake is long.\n\nOption 2: at turn 84, move L to (5,4)\n\nThen head at (5,4), direction L.\n\nThen we can move to (4,4) to eat food or other.\n\n(4,4) has food, so we can eat it on turn 85.\n\nAt turn 84, after moving L to (5,4), positions: head (5,4), body (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), tail (4,3)\n\nFood at (4,4) is free now.\n\nOn turn 85, head at (5,4), direction L, can move L to (4,4), U to (5,5), D to (5,3).\n\n(4,4) has food, so move L to (4,4) to eat it.\n\nThen snake grows, new length 20, head at (4,4), and the tail does not move, so tail still at (4,3).\n\nThen from there, we can explore.\n\nAlso, food at (2,5) can be targeted, life span 4, at turn 85, life span: at turn 82, life span 4, after 82 to 3, after 83 to 2, after 84 to 1, so at turn 85, life span 1, can be eaten, then after turn 85 to 0, gone.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) life span 7, at turn 85, still available.\n\nFrom (4,4), after eating, we can move towards (2,5).\n\nFor example, from (4,4), direction L (since we moved L to (4,4)), so can move L, U, D.\n\nL to (3,4): (3,4) is in body? Positions after eating: head at (4,4), body: (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3) tail.\n\n(3,4) is body segment, so cannot move there.\n\nU to (4,5): (4,5) free? Not in positions, and not wall, but internal obstacle at (4,6), so (4,5) ok.\n\nD to (4,3): (4,3) is tail, so can move to tail cell.\n\nBut tail cell (4,3) has no food, so no danger.\n\nIf move D to (4,3), we move to tail, no food, so no grow, tail moves, etc.\n\nBut let's not plan all.\n\nFor the immediate turns, at turn 84, moving L to (5,4) allows us to eat the food at (4,4) next turn.\n\nIf we move U to (6,5), we go to corner and might not get food soon.\n\nAlso, food at (2,5) is expiring soon, at turn 85 last chance.\n\nAt turn 84, head at (6,4), (2,5) is at (2,5), distance |6-2| + |4-5| =4+1=5, so with one move to (5,4), then from (5,4) to (2,5) is |5-2| + |4-5| =3+1=4, still not reachable in one move, so on turn 85, from (5,4), we can move towards it, but to reach (2,5) on turn 85, we need to be adjacent on turn 84, but we are not, so impossible to eat (2,5) on turn 85 from this position.\n\nAt turn 84, head at (6,4), (2,5) not adjacent.\n\nAfter move to (5,4), at turn 85 head at (5,4), (2,5) not adjacent, |5-2|=3, |4-5|=1, min moves 4.\n\nSo cannot reach by turn 85; it will disappear.\n\nSimilarly, only food we can eat soon is (4,4) if we go to (5,4) on turn 84 and then to (4,4) on turn 85.\n\n(4,4) life span 10, plenty of time.\n\n(1,1) also available.\n\nFor turn 82, action must be U.\n\nTurn 83 must be U.\n\nThen for turn 84, to maximize score, we should go for the food, so move L to (5,4).\n\nThen turn 85, move L to (4,4) to eat food.\n\nThen we can plan from there.\n\nBut we need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe answer format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't specify how many, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", probably list 5 actions or so.\n\nBut for now, for turn 82: U\n\nTurn 83: U\n\nTurn 84: L (to (5,4))\n\nThen turn 85: from (5,4), move L to (4,4) to eat.\n\nAfter eating, head at (4,4), and we can continue.\n\nBut let's confirm if on turn 84 moving L is safe.\n\nAt turn 84, from (6,4), move L to (5,4): (5,4) is free, no wall, not occupied, so safe.\n\nThen turn 85, move L to (4,4): (4,4) has food, and it's free, so we eat it, grow to 20.\n\nThen head at (4,4), direction L.\n\nThen possible moves: L to (3,4), U to (4,5), D to (4,3), R to (5,4) but R is reverse of L, not allowed.\n\n(3,4) is occupied? Positions after turn 85: after moving to (4,4) and eating, new head (4,4), body: (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), etc., and tail doesn't move, so positions include (3,4)? From earlier, after turn 84 move, positions: head (5,4), body (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3) tail.\n\n(3,4) is body segment.\n\nSo at turn 85, after move L to (4,4) and eat: new head (4,4), then body: (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3)  -- and since we ate, no tail removed, so length 20, tail still (4,3) for now, but (4,3) is occupied.\n\nHead at (4,4), can move:\n\nL to (3,4): but (3,4) is occupied by body, not tail, so collision.\n\nU to (4,5): (4,5) free? Not occupied, no wall, so possible.\n\nD to (4,3): (4,3) is tail, so can move to tail cell.\n\nR to (5,4): but reverse, not allowed since we moved L to get here.\n\nSo possible: U to (4,5) or D to (4,3).\n\nIf move U to (4,5), then to (4,6) but (4,6) is internal obstacle, wall, so cannot.\n\n(4,5) to (4,6) not possible.\n\nFrom (4,4) move U to (4,5), then from (4,5), can move to other directions.\n\nSimilarly, move D to (4,3), to tail.\n\nBut let's not go further.\n\nFor the answer, we can list actions for turn 82 to 86 or so.\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nTurn 83: U\n\nTurn 84: L (to (5,4))\n\nThen turn 85: from (5,4), move L to (4,4) to eat.\n\nBut at turn 85, after moving to (5,4) on turn 84, direction is L, so from (5,4) move L to (4,4), which is allowed.\n\nThen turn 86, from (4,4), we need to move, say U to (4,5) or D to (4,3).\n\nTo avoid dying, we can move U to (4,5), for example.\n\nBut we need to output the actions.\n\nSince the food at (4,4) can be eaten later, but it's available now, and we can score.\n\nAnother option: at turn 84, if we move U to (6,5), then we might not eat soon, but (4,4) food is there for 10 turns, so we can eat it later when convenient.\n\nBut moving to (5,4) allows us to eat on next turn.\n\nAlso, the snake is long, so eating food is good to score, but survival is key.\n\nBut in this case, both options seem safe for now.\n\nBut let's see the board; with internal obstacle at (4,6), and snake coiled, moving up might lead to dead end.\n\nFor example, if we go to (6,6), then only can go left to (5,6), then from (5,6), can go down or left, but left to (4,6) obstacle, so down to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut it might be tight.\n\nWhereas moving left to (5,4) opens more space.\n\nMoreover, we have food at (1,1) to consider.\n\nSo I think moving L on turn 84 is better.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nTurn 83: U\n\nTurn 84: L\n\nThen for turn 85, from (5,4) move L to (4,4) to eat.\n\nTurn 86, from (4,4) move U to (4,5) or something.\n\nBut we need to output only the actions, and since the state may change, probably output for a few turns.\n\nThe format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so list sequentially.\n\nSince t1=82, list for 82,83,84,85,86.\n\nFor turn 85, action is L to (4,4)\n\nThen turn 86, from (4,4), we can move U, as above.\n\nBut to be specific.\n\nPerhaps we can stop at turn 84 or 85.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nAnother thing: on turn 84, if we move L to (5,4), and (5,4) might be risky, but in this case it's free.\n\nI think it's ok.\n\nSo for the answer:\n</think>\nGiven the current state at turn 82, the snake must prioritize long-term survival and maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding collisions. After analyzing the grid, snake positions, food locations, and life spans, the only safe move at turn 82 is Up (U) to (6,3), as other moves lead to immediate collision or walls. Similarly, at turn 83, only Up (U) to (6,4) is safe. At turn 84, moving Left (L) to (5,4) is chosen to set up eating the food at (4,4) on turn 85, which has a long life span (10 turns) and is now accessible. Eating this food scores +1 and increases length. Moving to (5,4) also avoids the top-right corner, which could lead to dead ends. On turn 85, moving Left (L) to (4,4) eats the food safely, as there is no tail reward danger (head not adjacent to tail before moving). For turn 86, moving Up (U) to (4,5) is safe and explores the area, avoiding the obstacle at (4,6).\n\nThe food at (5,5) expires after turn 83 and is unreachable, so it is ignored. The food at (2,5) expires after turn 85 and is too far to reach safely, so it is not targeted. The food at (1,1) has a long life span (7 turns) and can be pursued later after eating (4,4).\n\nActions for turns 82 to 86 are planned with 5+ turns of foresight, ensuring the snake avoids risks and positions itself for future food opportunities.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 82: U  \nTurn 83: U  \nTurn 84: L  \nTurn 85: L  \nTurn 86: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 83, and I'm the snake AI. The grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7, and one internal obstacle at (4,6). So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), but with walls on the borders and an obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (6,3), and it's moving Up. The body segments are listed: [(6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)]. That's 19 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (5,5) with value 1 and life span 1 (so it disappears after this turn if not eaten)\n\n- (2,5) with value 1 and life span 3\n\n- (1,1) with value 1 and life span 6\n\n- (4,4) with value 1 and life span 9\n\nAll food has value +1, meaning they're all positive food. No negative food here.\n\nNow, the head is at (6,3) and direction is Up. From Up, I can move U, L, or R, but not D because that would be instant reverse. Current direction is U, so possible moves are U (continue up), L (left), or R (right). Down is opposite, so not allowed.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid. It's 8x8? x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so 8 cells each way.\n\nWalls: borders are walls, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are inaccessible. Also, internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake body: I should list all occupied cells by snake to avoid collisions.\n\nHead: (6,3)\n\nBody: (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\n(4,4) is listed as a food position, but it's also occupied by the snake? Food at (4,4) with life span 9, but snake has a segment at (4,4) according to positions.\n\nSnake positions include (4,4), which is the 18th segment? Let's count:\n\nPositions: index 0: (6,3) head, 1: (6,2), 2: (6,1), 3: (5,1), 4: (4,1), 5: (3,1), 6: (2,1), 7: (2,2), 8: (2,3), 9: (2,4), 10: (3,4), 11: (3,3), 12: (3,2), 13: (4,2), 14: (5,2), 15: (5,3), 16: (4,3), 17: (4,4), 18: (4,5) tail? (4,5) is the last, but food is at (4,4) and (4,5) is part of snake.\n\nFood at (4,4) is under the snake body? But according to positions, (4,4) is occupied by the 17th segment, so it's under the body.\n\nSpecial case: food can spawn under body but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it. So for (4,4), since it's under a body segment, not the head, it can be eaten only if that segment moves away and head moves there later.\n\nSimilarly, food at (5,5) is not under snake, I think. Let's see snake positions: (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), etc. (5,5) is not listed, so it's free.\n\n(2,5) not listed.\n\n(1,1) not listed, but (2,1) is snake, (1,1) might be free.\n\n(4,4) is snake position, so food at (4,4) is under body.\n\nNow, food life spans: (5,5) life span 1, so it disappears after this turn, meaning if not eaten on turn 83, it's gone. Since we're at turn 83, and food is eaten when head moves to it on that turn.\n\nTurn t_1=83, so on turn 83, if head moves to food cell, it eats it.\n\n(5,5) has life span 1, so after turn 83, it disappears. So only chance to eat it is on turn 83.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) life span 3, so it will disappear after turn 85? Life span decreases every turn including current.\n\nLife span N: disappears after N turns, meaning it will be gone at the start of turn t + N or something? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for food at turn t with life span L, it will be present for L more turns, including the current turn. After L turns, it disappears.\n\nFor example, at turn t, life span L, it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L.\n\nStandard: if life span is L at turn t, it decreases by 1 each turn, so after L decreases, it's gone. Countdown starts from L down to 0.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn t, countdown is L, then turn t+1, countdown L-1, ..., turn t+L-1, countdown 1, then turn t+L, it disappears.\n\nSo for eating, it can be eaten as long as countdown >0 when head moves to it.\n\nFor (5,5): at turn 83, life span 1, so countdown=1. If not eaten on turn 83, on turn 84 countdown=0, so it disappears, cannot be eaten.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5): life span 3, so can be eaten on turns 83,84,85, disappears on 86.\n\n(1,1): life span 6, can be eaten turns 83 to 88.\n\n(4,4): life span 9, can be eaten turns 83 to 91.\n\nBut (4,4) is currently under snake body, so unless that segment moves away, head can't eat it directly.\n\nNow, head at (6,3), direction Up.\n\nPossible moves: Up, Left, Right. Down not allowed.\n\nMove Up: to (6,4)\n\nMove Left: to (5,3)\n\nMove Right: to (7,3) but x=7 is wall, so cannot move right. x=7 is border wall.\n\nGrid: x from 0 to 7, walls at x=0 and x=7, y=0 and y=7.\n\nSo (6,3): x=6, y=3.\n\nMove Up: (6,4) - is that wall? y=4, not border, and no internal wall, so should be free, but need to check if occupied by snake or wall.\n\nFirst, walls: borders x=0,7; y=0,7; and (4,6).\n\n(6,4): x=6 not 0 or 7, y=4 not 0 or 7, not (4,6), so no wall.\n\nNow, snake positions: is (6,4) occupied? List: (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), etc. (6,4) not listed, so free.\n\nSimilarly, move Left: to (5,3) - (5,3) is in snake positions? Positions: (5,3) is index 15, which is a body segment. So occupied by body.\n\nMove to (5,3) would be collision with body, deadly.\n\nUnless it's the tail? Tail is at (4,5), I think. Positions: last is (4,5), which is the tail.\n\n(5,3) is not the tail; it's earlier. Index 15: (5,3), and tail is index 18: (4,5).\n\nSo moving to (5,3) is moving into a body segment, not tail, so collision, die.\n\nTherefore, cannot move Left to (5,3).\n\nMove Right: to (7,3) - x=7 is wall, so collision with wall, die.\n\nTherefore, from current position, only possible move is Up to (6,4)? But I have three choices: U, L, R.\n\nL and R are invalid: L to (5,3) body, R to (7,3) wall.\n\nSo only U is possible? But let's confirm.\n\nCurrent head (6,3), direction U.\n\nMove U: to (6,4)\n\nMove L: to (5,3) - but (5,3) is occupied by snake body segment, not tail.\n\nSnake positions: (5,3) is listed, index 15, and it's not the tail; tail is (4,5). So yes, body collision if move to (5,3).\n\nMove R: to (7,3), x=7 wall.\n\nSo indeed, only possible move is Up to (6,4).\n\nBut is (6,4) safe? It's not wall, not occupied by snake, as per positions.\n\nFood there? Food positions: (5,5), (2,5), (1,1), (4,4). No food at (6,4), so just empty.\n\nSo on turn 83, I must move Up to (6,4).\n\nBut I need to think ahead for multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps I should plan a sequence.\n\nSince (5,5) must be eaten this turn or it's gone, but I can't reach it this turn. From (6,3), to (5,5) is not adjacent; (5,5) is at x=5,y=5, head at (6,3), so not adjacent, can't reach in one move.\n\nAdjacent cells: up (6,4), down (6,2) but down is opposite direction, not allowed, left (5,3) body, right (7,3) wall. So no way to reach (5,5) this turn; it will disappear.\n\nSimilarly, other food: (2,5) at x=2,y=5, etc.\n\nSo (5,5) will be lost; I can't eat it.\n\nNow, after moving Up to (6,4), head at (6,4), direction now Up.\n\nThen next turn, possible moves from (6,4): U to (6,5), D to (6,3), L to (5,4), R to (7,4) wall.\n\nD is down, which is opposite to current direction? Current direction after move will be Up, since I moved U.\n\nAfter moving U from (6,3) to (6,4), the new head direction is U.\n\nThen from (6,4), moves: U to (6,5), D to (6,3) but D is opposite to U, so instant reverse not allowed? Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nCurrent direction after move is U, so cannot move D to (6,3).\n\nL to (5,4), R to (7,4) wall.\n\nR to (7,4) x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo possible: U to (6,5) or L to (5,4).\n\nNow, (6,5): not wall, not snake? Snake positions: (6,4) will be new head, but body: after move, snake moves: head to (6,4), tail moves away? When snake moves, head moves to new position, each segment moves to previous position, tail is removed if no food eaten.\n\nSince no food eaten on this move (turn 83, moving to (6,4) no food), so tail moves away, meaning the last segment is removed.\n\nCurrent tail is (4,5), so after move, tail (4,5) is removed, and new positions: head (6,4), then (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), ..., up to (4,4) or something.\n\nLet's trace the snake movement.\n\nCurrent positions: head (6,3), body segments down to tail (4,5).\n\nAfter moving Up to (6,4), the new head is (6,4).\n\nThen each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo segment 1 (was at (6,2)) moves to where head was (6,3)\n\nSegment 2 (was at (6,1)) moves to (6,2)\n\nSegment 3 (was at (5,1)) moves to (6,1)\n\nAnd so on, down to the tail.\n\nThe tail was at (4,5), and since no food eaten, it is removed, so the new snake has one less segment? No, length remains the same since no food eaten.\n\nSnake length: initially 19 segments. After move without eating, head moves to new cell, tail cell is vacated, so snake occupies the same number of cells, but shifted.\n\nNew positions: head at (6,4)\n\nThen the next segment is the old head (6,3)\n\nThen old segment 1: (6,2)\n\nOld segment 2: (6,1)\n\nOld segment 3: (5,1)\n\n...\n\nUp to the second last segment, which was at (4,4)? Let's list old positions with indices:\n\n0: (6,3) head\n\n1: (6,2)\n\n2: (6,1)\n\n3: (5,1)\n\n4: (4,1)\n\n5: (3,1)\n\n6: (2,1)\n\n7: (2,2)\n\n8: (2,3)\n\n9: (2,4)\n\n10: (3,4)\n\n11: (3,3)\n\n12: (3,2)\n\n13: (4,2)\n\n14: (5,2)\n\n15: (5,3)\n\n16: (4,3)\n\n17: (4,4)\n\n18: (4,5) tail\n\nAfter move, head moves to (6,4), so new position 0: (6,4)\n\nThen new position 1: old position 0: (6,3)\n\nNew position 2: old position 1: (6,2)\n\nNew position 3: old position 2: (6,1)\n\nNew position 4: old position 3: (5,1)\n\nNew position 5: old position 4: (4,1)\n\nNew position 6: old position 5: (3,1)\n\nNew position 7: old position 6: (2,1)\n\nNew position 8: old position 7: (2,2)\n\nNew position 9: old position 8: (2,3)\n\nNew position 10: old position 9: (2,4)\n\nNew position 11: old position 10: (3,4)\n\nNew position 12: old position 11: (3,3)\n\nNew position 13: old position 12: (3,2)\n\nNew position 14: old position 13: (4,2)\n\nNew position 15: old position 14: (5,2)\n\nNew position 16: old position 15: (5,3)\n\nNew position 17: old position 16: (4,3)\n\nNew position 18: old position 17: (4,4)  // this was where food is, but now the body moves to it\n\nOld position 18: (4,5) is not included, since tail is removed.\n\nSo new snake positions: head (6,4), then (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nNotice that (4,4) is now the tail, and it has food under it? But the body moved to it, so the food is still under the tail segment now.\n\nFor turn 84, head at (6,4), direction U (since last move was U).\n\nPossible moves:\n\nU to (6,5)\n\nD to (6,3) but D opposite to U, not allowed.\n\nL to (5,4)\n\nR to (7,4) wall, invalid.\n\nSo U or L.\n\n(6,5): not wall, not occupied? New positions: (6,4) is head, (6,3) is body, etc. (6,5) not in positions, so free.\n\n(5,4): not in positions, free.\n\nFood at (5,5) is gone, since life span was 1, not eaten turn 83.\n\nOther food: (2,5), (1,1), (4,4) but (4,4) is now the tail cell with food under it.\n\n(4,4) has food, but it's occupied by the tail. So to eat it, the tail must move away, and head must move there when it's free.\n\nCurrently on turn 84, if I move, the tail might move.\n\nBut let's plan.\n\nFirst, for turn 83, I must move U to (6,4) as only choice.\n\nThen for turn 84, from (6,4), I can go U to (6,5) or L to (5,4).\n\nI need to think about getting food and avoiding dead ends.\n\nAlso, the internal wall at (4,6), so (4,6) is blocked.\n\nFood targets: (2,5) can be eaten in next 3 turns, life span 3, so by turn 85.\n\n(1,1) by turn 88.\n\n(4,4) by turn 91, but it's under tail now.\n\nThe tail at (4,4) has food, so when the tail moves away, that cell becomes free with food, and I can eat it if head goes there.\n\nBut tail moves when the snake moves without eating food, or when it eats, tail doesn't move.\n\nIf no food eaten, tail moves away from its position.\n\nSo for (4,4), since it's tail, if I don't eat food on a move, the tail will move away, and (4,4) becomes free with food.\n\nThen I can go there to eat it.\n\nBut I need to be careful with timing.\n\nAlso, the snake is long, so I need space to maneuver.\n\nLet me sketch the grid mentally.\n\nGrid 8x8: rows y=0 to 7, columns x=0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all border cells, so accessible area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except internal obstacle (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is wall, so cells (1,1) to (6,6) minus (4,6).\n\nx=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, but (4,6) blocked.\n\nSnake positions after turn 83 move: head (6,4), body: (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), tail (4,4)\n\nThe body forms a sort of loop or something. Let's see the path.\n\nFrom head (6,4) to (6,3) to (6,2) to (6,1) to (5,1) to (4,1) to (3,1) to (2,1) to (2,2) to (2,3) to (2,4) to (3,4) to (3,3) to (3,2) to (4,2) to (5,2) to (5,3) to (4,3) to tail (4,4)\n\nSo it's like the snake is coiled in the bottom-left, with the head now at (6,4).\n\nAvailable spaces: for example, top-right is free, but (4,6) blocked.\n\nFood: (2,5) at (2,5), which is above the body at (2,4).\n\n(2,4) is a body segment, and (2,5) is north of it.\n\n(1,1) at (1,1), which might be accessible.\n\n(4,4) is tail, with food under it.\n\nFor turn 84, from (6,4), I can go to (6,5) or (5,4).\n\nIf I go U to (6,5), then head to (6,5), direction U.\n\nThen from there, I can go U to (6,6), L to (5,5), D to (6,4) but D opposite if direction U, not allowed, R to (7,5) wall.\n\nU to (6,6): y=6, but y=6 is not border wall? Borders are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is ok, but (6,6) is not wall, and not snake? After move to (6,5), new positions, but let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, let's consider options for turn 84.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (6,5)\n\nThen head at (6,5), direction U.\n\nPossible next moves: U to (6,6), L to (5,5), R to (7,5) wall, D not allowed.\n\n(6,6) is free, (5,5) is free? After previous move, snake positions: if I move to (6,5) on turn 84, from current after turn 83.\n\nAfter turn 83: head (6,4), positions as above.\n\nMove U to (6,5): new head (6,5), new body: (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), and tail (4,4) removed? No food, so tail removed.\n\nOld tail (4,4) is removed, so new positions: head (6,5), then (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3)  // 19 segments? Old had 19, after move no eat, still 19, but tail removed and head added, so positions shift.\n\nOld: 19 cells.\n\nAfter move: head to new, each body to previous, so the last cell (tail) is removed, so new snake has 19 cells, but the first is new head, last is the previous second last.\n\nIn this case, after move to (6,5), new head (6,5)\n\nThen new segment 1: old head (6,4)\n\nNew seg 2: old seg 1 (6,3)\n\nNew seg 3: old seg 2 (6,2)\n\nNew seg 4: old seg 3 (6,1)\n\nNew seg 5: old seg 4 (5,1)\n\nNew seg 6: old seg 5 (4,1)\n\nNew seg 7: old seg 6 (3,1)\n\nNew seg 8: old seg 7 (2,1)\n\nNew seg 9: old seg 8 (2,2)\n\nNew seg 10: old seg 9 (2,3)\n\nNew seg 11: old seg 10 (2,4)\n\nNew seg 12: old seg 11 (3,4)\n\nNew seg 13: old seg 12 (3,3)\n\nNew seg 14: old seg 13 (3,2)\n\nNew seg 15: old seg 14 (4,2)\n\nNew seg 16: old seg 15 (5,2)\n\nNew seg 17: old seg 16 (5,3)\n\nNew seg 18: old seg 17 (4,3)\n\nNew seg 19: old seg 18 (4,4)  // old tail, but it was at (4,4), and it becomes the new tail? Old positions: seg 18 was (4,5)? No.\n\nAfter turn 83 move, positions are: head (6,4), then (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nSo seg 0: (6,4), seg 1: (6,3), ..., seg 18: (4,4) tail.\n\nFor turn 84, move U to (6,5): new head (6,5)\n\nNew seg 1: old seg 0 (6,4)\n\nNew seg 2: old seg 1 (6,3)\n\n...\n\nNew seg 19: old seg 18 (4,4)  // so tail is still (4,4) for now, but when we move, the tail position changes.\n\nAfter move, the new tail is the old seg 18, which is (4,4), but since we moved, and no eat, the cell (4,4) is vacated, and new tail is at old seg 17 position? Let's think.\n\nWhen snake moves without eating: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous one, so the last segment (tail) is removed from the grid, and the new tail is the segment that was second last.\n\nPositions: after move, the snake occupies: new cell for head, and for i from 1 to L-1, position i is old position i-1.\n\nSo the old tail position is abandoned.\n\nIn this case, after moving to (6,5), new positions: head (6,5), then body: old head (6,4), old seg1 (6,3), old seg2 (6,2), old seg3 (6,1), old seg4 (5,1), ..., up to old seg17 (4,3), and new tail is old seg18 (4,4).\n\nOld positions: seg0: (6,4), seg1: (6,3), seg2: (6,2), seg3: (6,1), seg4: (5,1), seg5: (4,1), seg6: (3,1), seg7: (2,1), seg8: (2,2), seg9: (2,3), seg10: (2,4), seg11: (3,4), seg12: (3,3), seg13: (3,2), seg14: (4,2), seg15: (5,2), seg16: (5,3), seg17: (4,3), seg18: (4,4)\n\nAfter move to (6,5): new seg0: (6,5)\n\nNew seg1: old seg0 (6,4)\n\nNew seg2: old seg1 (6,3)\n\nNew seg3: old seg2 (6,2)\n\nNew seg4: old seg3 (6,1)\n\nNew seg5: old seg4 (5,1)\n\nNew seg6: old seg5 (4,1)\n\nNew seg7: old seg6 (3,1)\n\nNew seg8: old seg7 (2,1)\n\nNew seg9: old seg8 (2,2)\n\nNew seg10: old seg9 (2,3)\n\nNew seg11: old seg10 (2,4)\n\nNew seg12: old seg11 (3,4)\n\nNew seg13: old seg12 (3,3)\n\nNew seg14: old seg13 (3,2)\n\nNew seg15: old seg14 (4,2)\n\nNew seg16: old seg15 (5,2)\n\nNew seg17: old seg16 (5,3)\n\nNew seg18: old seg17 (4,3)  // new tail at (4,3)\n\nOld seg18 (4,4) is removed, so (4,4) is now free, and it has food, so the food at (4,4) is now accessible, since body moved away.\n\nOn turn 84, after moving to (6,5), the cell (4,4) is free with food.\n\nBut head is at (6,5), far away.\n\nFrom (6,5), I can move U to (6,6) or L to (5,5).\n\n(6,6): y=6, not border, not wall, free.\n\n(5,5): free, no food now, since (5,5) food disappeared.\n\nIf I move L to (5,5), then I eat the food there? But (5,5) food is gone, so no.\n\n(5,5) had life span 1, not eaten turn 83, so gone.\n\nSo (5,5) is empty.\n\nMove U to (6,6): then head to (6,6), direction U.\n\nThen from there, I can go U to (6,7) but y=7 wall, invalid; D to (6,5) but D opposite if direction U, not allowed; L to (5,6); R to (7,6) wall.\n\nSo only L to (5,6).\n\n(5,6): not wall, but (4,6) is wall, so (5,6) should be free, but let's see.\n\n(5,6) is not occupied, I assume.\n\nBut then from (5,6), I can go to (5,7) wall, or (4,6) wall, or (5,5), or (6,6) but (6,6) is body after move.\n\nThis might lead to a dead end.\n\nIf from (6,5) I go L to (5,5), then head to (5,5), direction L (since moved left).\n\nThen from (5,5), possible moves: U to (5,6), D to (5,4), L to (4,5), R to (6,5) but R opposite to L? Current direction L, so R is opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo U, D, or L.\n\nBut (5,6) free, (5,4) free, (4,5) free.\n\nThen I can go towards (2,5) or (1,1).\n\nBack to turn 84 choice.\n\nAlternative to moving U, I could move L from (6,4) to (5,4) on turn 84.\n\nFrom (6,4) after turn 83, move L to (5,4).\n\nThen new head (5,4), direction L.\n\nThen new positions: head (5,4), new seg1: old head (6,4), new seg2: old seg1 (6,3), ..., new seg18: old seg17 (4,3), new tail: old seg18 (4,4) removed? Similar to before.\n\nAfter move to (5,4), new head (5,4)\n\nNew seg1: (6,4)  // old head\n\nNew seg2: (6,3)  // old seg1\n\n...\n\nNew seg18: (4,3)  // old seg17\n\nOld seg18 (4,4) removed, so (4,4) free with food.\n\nHead at (5,4), which is closer to (4,4) or other food.\n\nFrom (5,4), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,5), D to (5,3), L to (4,4), R to (6,4) but R opposite to L, not allowed.\n\nSo U, D, or L.\n\n(5,5) free, (5,3) is body? New positions: (5,4) head, (6,4) body, (6,3) body, etc. (5,3) is new seg17 or something, let's see.\n\nNew positions: seg0: (5,4), seg1: (6,4), seg2: (6,3), seg3: (6,2), seg4: (6,1), seg5: (5,1), seg6: (4,1), seg7: (3,1), seg8: (2,1), seg9: (2,2), seg10: (2,3), seg11: (2,4), seg12: (3,4), seg13: (3,3), seg14: (3,2), seg15: (4,2), seg16: (5,2), seg17: (5,3), seg18: (4,3) tail at (4,3)\n\n(5,3) is seg17, body segment.\n\nSo (5,3) occupied, not free.\n\n(5,5) free, (4,4) free with food, (5,3) occupied, so cannot move D to (5,3).\n\nMoves: U to (5,5), L to (4,4), or D not possible.\n\nL to (4,4) would eat the food there, since it's free now.\n\n(4,4) has value 1, life span 9, so eating it increases length by 1.\n\nIf I move to (4,4) on turn 84, I eat the food, so tail does not move, and new segment added.\n\nThen snake grows.\n\nBut first, for turn 84, if I choose to move L from (6,4) to (5,4), then on turn 84 head to (5,4), and I can then move L to (4,4) to eat food.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nFor turn 83: only choice is U to (6,4)\n\nThen for turn 84: I have two choices: U to (6,5) or L to (5,4)\n\nIf I go L to (5,4), then from there, I can go L to (4,4) to eat food on turn 85? Turn 84 move to (5,4), then turn 85 move to (4,4).\n\nOn turn 84, after moving to (5,4), the food at (4,4) is free, as we saw.\n\nThen on turn 85, from (5,4), I can move L to (4,4) to eat it.\n\nBut turn 84 is when I move to (5,4), and (4,4) is free, but I'm at (5,4), not at (4,4) yet.\n\nTo eat on turn 85.\n\nSimilarly, if on turn 84 I move directly to (4,4) from (6,4)? No, from (6,4), (4,4) is not adjacent; adjacent are (6,5), (5,4), (6,3) invalid, (7,4) invalid.\n\nSo from (6,4), I can only go to (6,5) or (5,4), not directly to (4,4).\n\nSo if I go to (5,4) on turn 84, then on turn 85 I can go to (4,4) to eat.\n\nIf I go to (6,5) on turn 84, then (4,4) is free but far.\n\nNow, another food: (2,5) at (2,5), life span 3, so can be eaten on turns 83,84,85.\n\nTurn 83 is over, head at (6,4), not at (2,5).\n\nOn turn 84, from (6,4), if I go to (5,4), I'm closer to (2,5), but (2,5) is at (2,5), (5,4) to (2,5) is not close.\n\n(1,1) is also food.\n\nBut (2,5) has short life, only 3 turns, so by turn 85 must eat or lost.\n\nTurn 83: not eaten\n\nTurn 84: if I can reach, but from (6,4) to (2,5) is far, not possible in one move.\n\nTurn 85: last chance.\n\nSo I need to be near (2,5) on turn 85.\n\nCurrently after turn 83, head at (6,4), (2,5) is at distance |6-2| + |4-5| = 4+1=5, so not reachable in one or two moves? In two moves, maximum Manhattan distance 2, but 5>2, so cannot reach by turn 84, only possible by turn 85.\n\nTurn 84: from (6,4), I move to say (5,4) or (6,5), then on turn 85, I need to be at (2,5) or adjacent to move there.\n\nBut from (5,4) to (2,5): |5-2| + |4-5| =3+1=4, still far, cannot reach in one move.\n\nSimilarly from (6,5) to (2,5): |6-2| + |5-5| =4+0=4, not adjacent.\n\nSo on turn 85, I cannot be at (2,5) unless I move towards it, but from current position, it's impossible to reach (2,5) by turn 85 because the Manhattan distance is at least 4, and in two moves I can cover at most 2 steps, so minimum distance to (2,5) in two moves is 2, but from (6,4) to (2,5) is (4,1) difference, so after one move, I can be at (5,4) or (6,5), distance to (2,5) is |5-2|+|4-5|=3+1=4 or |6-2|+|5-5|=4+0=4, then after second move, I can reduce by 1, to distance 3, not to 0. So I cannot be at (2,5) on turn 85. Thus, (2,5) cannot be eaten and will disappear after turn 85, uneaten.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) has more time.\n\nSo food (2,5) will be lost; I can't reach it in time.\n\nOnly food I can eat is (1,1) and (4,4), but (4,4) is now free after turn 83 move? After turn 83 move to (6,4), the tail moved from (4,4)? No.\n\nAfter turn 83 move to (6,4), the new tail is at (4,4), and (4,4) has food under it, but it's occupied by the tail segment.\n\nThen when I move on turn 84, if I don't eat food, the tail moves away, and (4,4) becomes free with food.\n\nFor example, if on turn 84 I move to (6,5) or to (5,4), in both cases, the tail moves, so (4,4) is vacated and food is there.\n\nThen I can eat it later.\n\nBut to eat it, head needs to move to (4,4).\n\nNow, from current head position (6,4), (4,4) is at |6-4| + |4-4| =2+0=2, so adjacent in x-direction.\n\nFrom (6,4), I can move L to (5,4) on turn 84, then from (5,4), I can move L to (4,4) on turn 85 to eat it.\n\nIf I move U to (6,5) on turn 84, then from (6,5), I can move L to (5,5), then to (4,5) or something, but (4,4) is south of (4,5), etc., takes more moves.\n\nSo shorter path is to go left.\n\nAlso, after eating (4,4), I grow, and I need to think about survival.\n\nMoreover, there is (1,1) food with life span 6, so I have time.\n\nBut let's see the grid occupancy.\n\nAfter eating (4,4), the snake will be longer, and the area around (4,4) might be tight.\n\nCurrently, after turn 83, positions include many cells around (4,4).\n\nFor example, (4,4) is tail, (4,3) is body, (5,3) body, (5,4) free, etc.\n\nIf I move to (5,4) on turn 84, then to (4,4) on turn 85 to eat.\n\nOn turn 85, after eating, tail doesn't move, so I grow to 20 segments.\n\nThen from (4,4), direction L (since moved left from (5,4)).\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,5), D to (4,3), L to (3,4), R to (5,4) but R opposite to L? Current direction L, so R opposite not allowed.\n\nNow, (4,5): is it free? After turn 84, if I moved to (5,4) on turn 84, let's trace positions.\n\nTurn 84: from (6,4) move L to (5,4)\n\nNew head (5,4)\n\nNew seg1: (6,4)\n\nNew seg2: (6,3)\n\n...\n\nNew seg18: (4,3)  // as before, tail at (4,3)\n\nOld tail (4,4) removed, so (4,4) free with food.\n\nOn turn 85, move L to (4,4): head to (4,4), eat food, so tail does not move, new segment added at tail position? When eat food, head moves to food cell, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position, so snake grows.\n\nPrevious tail was at (4,3), so new tail is at (4,3), and new segment added there.\n\nPositions: new head (4,4), then the body is the previous positions except the tail doesn't move away.\n\nAfter turn 84, positions: head (5,4), body: (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), tail (4,3)\n\nOn turn 85, move to (4,4): since (4,4) has food, head moves to (4,4), and the tail does not move, so the new snake has head at (4,4), then the first body segment is the old head (5,4), then old seg1 (6,4), ..., up to old tail (4,3), which remains, so new tail is still at (4,3), but since we add a segment, the old tail stays, and new segment is added, but the new segment is the old tail position, so positions: new head (4,4), new seg1: old head (5,4), new seg2: old seg1 (6,4), new seg3: old seg2 (6,3), ..., new seg19: old seg18 (4,3), and since ate food, we add a new segment at the position of the old tail, which is (4,3), so now two segments at (4,3)? No.\n\nWhen snake eats, head moves to new cell (the food cell), and the tail remains where it is, but a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail position stays the same, but the snake grows by one segment.\n\nThe new segment is attached to the tail, so the tail cell has the new tail segment, and the previous tail is now the second last.\n\nIn terms of positions: after moving to food, the head is at the new position, the body segments follow, and the tail is still at the old tail position, with an additional segment before it? Let's think.\n\nBefore move, positions: let's say S0, S1, ..., S_{L-1} where S0 head, S_{L-1} tail.\n\nAfter moving to a food cell: new head at food position, new segment 1 at old S0, new segment 2 at old S1, ..., new segment L at old S_{L-1}, and new segment L+1 at old S_{L-1} (same position), so the tail is still at old tail position.\n\nFor example, before eat, snake: positions A (head), B, C, ..., Y (tail)\n\nAfter moving to food F (and eating), new head at F, new seg1 at A, new seg2 at B, ..., new segL at Y, and since ate, add new segment at Y, so new positions: F, A, B, C, ..., Y, with Y being the new tail? No: new head F, then new body: A, B, C, ..., Y, and the new tail is at Y, so Y is now the second last, and the new last is also at Y? That can't be.\n\nI think I'm confusing.\n\nStandard snake growth: when snake eats, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added to the tail, so the tail does not move; it stays in place, and the new segment is the new tail at the same position. So the snake length increases by one, and the tail position remains occupied.\n\nIn terms of cells: the head moves to the new cell, the body shifts, but the tail cell does not change; it stays occupied, and since a new segment is added there, it's like the tail doesn't move.\n\nFor example, before eat: cells: H, B1, B2, ..., T\n\nAfter moving to food F: new head F, then B1 moves to H, B2 moves to B1, ..., T stays, and new segment added at T, so now cells: F, H, B1, B2, ..., T with T still occupied.\n\nSo the position T has a segment, and it is the tail.\n\nIn this case, for turn 85, after moving to (4,4), which is food, new head (4,4), then new seg1: old head (5,4), new seg2: old seg1 (6,4), ..., new seg19: old seg18 (4,3), and since ate, new seg20 at (4,3), so tail at (4,3).\n\nPositions: new head (4,4), then (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), and tail at (4,3) with the new segment.\n\n(4,3) is occupied by two segments? No, in the list, new seg19 and new seg20 both at (4,3)? That's wrong.\n\nPositions are unique; each cell has one segment.\n\nAfter move and eat: the head is at new position F.\n\nThe segment that was at the old head position moves to where the head was, but since head moved, it's like the body follows.\n\nThe body segments shift: the first body segment moves to the old head position, second to the first body position, and so on, up to the tail: the tail stays in place, and because of eating, a new segment is added at the tail position, so the tail position now has the new tail, and the previous tail is now the second last segment.\n\nIn terms of indices: suppose before: positions P0 (head), P1, P2, ..., P_{L-1} (tail)\n\nAfter moving to food F: new head at F.\n\nThen new position 1: P0 (old head)\n\nNew position 2: P1 (old position 1)\n\n...\n\nNew position L: P_{L-1} (old tail)\n\nAnd new position L+1: P_{L-1} (same as new position L, but that's duplicate)\n\nNo: the new segment is added at the position where the tail was, but since the tail didn't move, it's the same cell.\n\nSo the cell P_{L-1} now has a segment that is the new tail, and it is listed once.\n\nThe positions are: F, P0, P1, P2, ..., P_{L-1}\n\nWith P_{L-1} being the tail.\n\nFor example, L segments before, after eating, L+1 segments: head at F, then P0, P1, ..., P_{L-1}, with P_{L-1} tail.\n\nIn this case, before move on turn 85, after turn 84: positions: head (5,4), then (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), tail (4,3)\n\nSo L=19 segments.\n\nMove to (4,4) which is food, so new head at (4,4)\n\nThen new body: old head (5,4), old seg1 (6,4), old seg2 (6,3), ..., up to old tail (4,3)\n\nSo new positions: head (4,4), then (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), and tail at (4,3)\n\nSo the tail is still at (4,3), and the new segment is added there, but it's the same position, so no new cell occupied; the snake just has an extra segment at the tail.\n\nFrom (4,4), direction L (since moved left from (5,4)).\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,5), D to (4,3), L to (3,4), R to (5,4) but R opposite to L, not allowed.\n\n(4,5): not wall, not occupied? New positions: (4,4) head, (5,4) body, (6,4) body, etc., (4,5) not listed, so free.\n\n(4,3): is tail, so moving to (4,3) is moving to the tail cell. Rule: you can move into the tail cell because the tail will move away, so no collision, as long as it's not a body segment.\n\n(4,3) is the tail, so moving to it is safe; the tail will move, and head takes its place.\n\nD to (4,3) would be down, which may or may not be opposite, but direction is L, so D is not opposite; opposite would be R.\n\nDirections: from (4,4), moving D to (4,3) is down, current direction is L (left), so not opposite, allowed.\n\nL to (3,4) is left.\n\nU to (4,5) up.\n\nAll possible, but (4,3) is tail, so safe to move there.\n\nIf I move to (4,3), since it's tail, and no food there, I just move, tail moves away.\n\nBut in this case, after eating, I have options.\n\nBut back to the choice.\n\nFor turn 84, if I move L to (5,4), then on turn 85 I can eat (4,4) and grow.\n\nIf I move U to (6,5) on turn 84, then from (6,5), I can go to (6,6) or (5,5), and (4,4) is free but far, and I might not eat it soon.\n\nBut (4,4) has life span 9, plenty of time.\n\nAlso, there is (1,1) food.\n\nBut moving up might lead to the top area, which has the obstacle at (4,6).\n\n(4,6) is wall, so near top.\n\nFor long-term survival, I need to avoid boxing myself in.\n\nThe snake is coiled in the bottom-left, so moving up or left might open space.\n\nMoving left to eat (4,4) seems good for immediate reward.\n\nAlso, after eating, I can go to (1,1) or other areas.\n\nAnother thing: the head is adjacent to the tail? Rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn this case, before eating (4,4), on turn 84, head at (5,4), tail at (4,3), are they adjacent? (5,4) and (4,3): |5-4| + |4-3| =1+1=2, not adjacent; adjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right.\n\n(5,4) and (4,3) are diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent cells would be (5,3), (5,5), (4,4), (6,4).\n\n(4,4) is the food cell, not tail.\n\nTail is at (4,3), so (5,4) adjacent to (5,3), (5,5), (4,4), (6,4).\n\n(4,3) is at (4,3), which is down-left, not adjacent.\n\nSo head not adjacent to tail, so no danger.\n\nWhen I move to (4,4) to eat, head was at (5,4), moving to (4,4), which is adjacent and has food, but tail is at (4,3), not at (4,4), so no issue.\n\nAfter eating, head at (4,4), tail at (4,3), now they are adjacent, but no food on tail cell, so no problem.\n\nIf I were to eat food on tail cell when head adjacent, but here not the case.\n\nSo safe.\n\nNow, for the sequence, on turn 83, I must move U to (6,4)\n\nThen on turn 84, I should move L to (5,4) to set up eating (4,4) on turn 85.\n\nThen on turn 85, move L to (4,4) to eat the food.\n\nThen after that, I need to choose where to go.\n\nBut since I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least for turn 83 and ahead.\n\nThe answer should be for turns starting from t_1=83.\n\nSo for turn 83: U\n\nThen for turn 84: L (to (5,4))\n\nThen turn 85: L (to (4,4) eat)\n\nNow, what about turn 86 and beyond?\n\nAfter turn 85, head at (4,4), direction L.\n\nAs above, I can move U to (4,5), D to (4,3), or L to (3,4)\n\n(4,3) is tail, so moving there is safe.\n\n(3,4) is body? Positions after eating: head (4,4), then (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), tail (4,3)\n\n(3,4) is in positions, it's a body segment, not tail, so moving to (3,4) would be collision.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) is free.\n\n(4,3) is tail, free to move.\n\nNow, (1,1) food is available, life span 6, so from turn 83 to 88, now turn 85, so turns 85,86,87,88 to eat.\n\n(1,1) at (1,1), which is occupied? Snake has (2,1), (3,1), etc., but (1,1) not listed, so free.\n\nTo reach (1,1), I can go down or left.\n\nFrom (4,4), move L to (3,4) but (3,4) is body, collision.\n\nMove D to (4,3) which is tail, safe.\n\nMove U to (4,5).\n\nIf I move D to (4,3), then head to (4,3), and since no food, tail moves away.\n\nNew positions: head (4,3), then old head (4,4), then (5,4), etc., tail moves from (4,3)? After move to (4,3), new head (4,3), new body: old head (4,4), old seg1 (5,4), ..., up to old tail (4,3) but old tail is (4,3), which is where head is moving, but since it's tail, it's ok, new head at (4,3), then body starts from old head (4,4), so new seg1: (4,4), new seg2: (5,4), ..., new seg19: (5,3), and tail at (5,3) or something.\n\nOld positions before move: head (4,4), body: (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), tail (4,3)\n\nMove to (4,3): (4,3) is tail, so no collision. New head at (4,3), then new seg1: old head (4,4), new seg2: old seg1 (5,4), new seg3: old seg2 (6,4), new seg4: old seg3 (6,3), ..., new seg19: old seg18 (5,3), and old tail (4,3) is removed, so new tail at (5,3).\n\n(4,3) was tail, vacated, head moves there.\n\nThen I can continue to (4,2) or (3,3), etc., towards (1,1).\n\nSimilarly, I could move U to (4,5) to go up.\n\nBut since (1,1) is in bottom-left, moving down might be better.\n\nAlso, the area around (4,4) might be tight after growing.\n\nBut for now, to maximize score, eating (4,4) is good, and then I can go for (1,1).\n\nSince I need to output a sequence, and think ahead, but for the answer, I can output a few turns.\n\nThe format is to output actions for turn t_1, t_1+1, etc.\n\nBut it doesn't specify how many, but since it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide at least 5 actions.\n\nTurn 83,84,85,86,87.\n\nFrom above:\n\nTurn 83: U (to (6,4))\n\nTurn 84: L (to (5,4))\n\nTurn 85: L (to (4,4) eat food)\n\nNow turn 86: from (4,4), after eating, head at (4,4), direction L.\n\nI need to choose move.\n\nPossible: U to (4,5), D to (4,3), L to (3,4) but (3,4) is body, collision, not possible.\n\nR to (5,4) but R opposite to L, not allowed.\n\nSo only U or D.\n\n(4,5) free, (4,3) is tail, safe.\n\nIf I move D to (4,3), then to go towards (1,1).\n\n(1,1) is at (1,1), from (4,3), I can go left or down.\n\nAfter moving to (4,3), head at (4,3), direction D (since moved down).\n\nThen from there, I can go to (4,2), (3,3), etc.\n\n(4,2) is body? After move, positions change.\n\nBut let's not detail all.\n\nSince (1,1) is available, and life span, I can plan to go there.\n\nBut also, the grid has limited space, and snake is long, so I need to uncoil or something.\n\nBut for the sequence, I can output:\n\nTurn 86: D (to (4,3))\n\nThen turn 87: from (4,3), direction D, I can move D to (4,2), L to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut (4,2) might be occupied or not.\n\nAfter turn 85 eat, positions: head (4,4), body (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), tail (4,3)\n\n(4,2) is body, (3,3) body.\n\nFrom (4,4) move D to (4,3) on turn 86: new head (4,3), direction D.\n\nThen new positions: head (4,3), seg1: old head (4,4), seg2: old seg1 (5,4), seg3: old seg2 (6,4), ..., seg19: old seg18 (5,3), tail at (5,3)\n\n(4,2) is old seg16 or something, now it might be different.\n\nNew seg4: old seg3 (6,3)?

(5,3) is new tail, so can move there.\n\n(4,2): is it free? New positions: head (4,3), then (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), etc. (4,2) is old seg16, which was (4,2), and in new positions, it is new seg16 or something.\n\nNew seg16: let's see, new seg1: (4,4), seg2: (5,4), seg3: (6,4), seg4: (6,3), seg5: (6,2), seg6: (6,1), seg7: (5,1), seg8: (4,1), seg9: (3,1), seg10: (2,1), seg11: (2,2), seg12: (2,3), seg13: (2,4), seg14: (3,4), seg15: (3,3), seg16: (3,2), seg17: (4,2), seg18: (5,2), seg19: (5,3) tail\n\nSo (4,2) is seg17, body segment.\n\n(3,3) is seg15, body.\n\n(5,3) is tail, seg19.\n\nSo from (4,3), move D to (4,2): (4,2) is seg17, body, collision.\n\nMove L to (3,3): (3,3) is seg15, body, collision.\n\nMove R to (5,3): (5,3) is tail, so safe to move.\n\nU not allowed.\n\nSo only possible move is R to (5,3).\n\nThen to (5,3), which is tail, no food, so move there.\n\nThen from there, etc.\n\nBut this might be getting into a corner.\n\nTo avoid this, on turn 86, from (4,4), instead of moving D, move U to (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is free, no issue.\n\nThen from there, I can go up or left.\n\nBut (1,1) is down, so moving up might take me away from (1,1).\n\nBut (1,1) has time.\n\nSince I need to output a sequence, and for turn 83 to 87.\n\nFor turn 86, from (4,4) I can move U to (4,5).\n\nThen direction U.\n\nThen from (4,5), I can move U to (4,6) but (4,6) is wall, invalid; D to (4,4) opposite, not allowed; L to (3,5); R to (5,5).\n\n(3,5) and (5,5) free.\n\nThen I can go towards the center or something.\n\nBut for the purpose, I think eating the food is priority, and I have (1,1) to eat later.\n\nSo for the sequence, I'll go with:\n\nTurn 83: U\n\nTurn 84: L\n\nTurn 85: L (eat)\n\nThen turn 86: U (to (4,5)) to avoid the tight spot.\n\nThen turn 87: from (4,5), direction U, I can move L to (3,5) or R to (5,5).\n\nSay L to (3,5) to go left.\n\nBut let's not specify further.\n\nSince the answer format might expect actions for t1 to t1+4 or something.\n\nI think for now, output up to turn 87.\n\nBut turn 83 is t1=83, so actions for 83,84,85,86,87.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 83: U\n\nTurn 84: L\n\nTurn 85: L\n\nTurn 86: U (from (4,4) to (4,5))\n\nTurn 87: from (4,5), direction U, possible moves: L to (3,5), R to (5,5), or D not allowed, U to (4,6) wall.\n\nSo I can choose L or R.\n\nSay L to (3,5) to head towards (1,1).\n\nBut (1,1) is at (1,1), (3,5) to (1,1) is far.\n\nBut I have time.\n\nTo be consistent.\n\nPerhaps for turn 87, move L to (3,5).\n\nBut I think it's fine.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 83: U\n\nTurn 84: L\n\nTurn 85: L\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: L\n\nBut let's confirm if on turn 84, moving L is better than U.\n\nIf I move U on turn 84 to (6,5), then I miss the chance to eat (4,4) soon, and I might not eat it later if I forget, but I can eat (1,1) or others.\n\nBut (4,4) has high life span, so I can eat it later, but moving up might explore new areas.\n\nBut with the obstacle at (4,6), top might be risky.\n\nFor example, from (6,5), if I go U to (6,6), then only L to (5,6), then from (5,6), I can go to (5,7) wall, or (4,6) wall, or (5,5), or (6,6) body.\n\n(5,5) and (6,6) might be occupied later.\n\nFor instance, from (5,6), move to (5,5), then to (5,4) or etc.\n\nBut it could lead to dead end if not careful.\n\nWhereas moving left to eat food and then down to uncoil might be better for survival.\n\nSo I think moving L on turn 84 is better.\n\nThus, the sequence I have is reasonable.\n</think>\nBased on the current state at turn \\(t_1 = 83\\), the snake must prioritize survival and maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding collisions. After evaluating all possible moves 5+ turns ahead, the optimal action sequence is determined as follows:\n\n- **Turn 83**: The snake head is at (6,3) with direction Up. Possible moves are Up (to (6,4)), Left (to (5,3)), or Right (to (7,3)). Moving Left to (5,3) causes a body collision (as (5,3) is occupied by a non-tail segment). Moving Right to (7,3) causes a wall collision (x=7 is a border wall). Thus, the only safe move is **Up** to (6,4), which is empty and safe. No food is eaten.\n\n- **Turn 84**: After moving Up, the head is at (6,4) with direction Up. Possible moves are Up (to (6,5)) or Left (to (5,4)); Down is invalid (instant reverse), and Right (to (7,4)) is a wall. Moving Left to (5,4) positions the snake to eat the food at (4,4) on the next turn, as the tail at (4,4) will move away after this move (no food eaten), making (4,4) accessible. Moving Up to (6,5) delays eating and may lead to less efficient paths. Thus, **Left** to (5,4) is chosen for better food access and survival. No food is eaten.\n\n- **Turn 85**: After moving Left, the head is at (5,4) with direction Left. Possible moves are Up (to (5,5)), Left (to (4,4)), or Down (to (5,3)); Right is invalid (instant reverse). (5,3) is occupied by a body segment, so Down is unsafe. Moving Left to (4,4) eats the positive food there (value +1, life span 9), increasing length by 1. (4,4) is now free and safe to eat, as the tail moved away on the previous turn. Thus, **Left** to (4,4) is chosen to gain score.\n\n- **Turn 86**: After eating at (4,4), the head is at (4,4) with direction Left. Possible moves are Up (to (4,5)) or Down (to (4,3)); Left (to (3,4)) causes a body collision (as (3,4) is occupied), and Right is invalid (instant reverse). Moving Down to (4,3) is safe (it is the tail cell), but leads to a confined area with limited future mobility. Moving Up to (4,5) opens space toward less occupied regions and avoids immediate risks. Thus, **Up** to (4,5) is chosen for better long-term survival.\n\n- **Turn 87**: After moving Up, the head is at (4,5) with direction Up. Possible moves are Left (to (3,5)) or Right (to (5,5)); Up (to (4,6)) is a wall (internal obstacle), and Down is invalid (instant reverse). Moving Left to (3,5) begins navigation toward the food at (1,1) (life span 6, can be eaten by turn 88) and avoids potential dead ends. Moving Right to (5,5) is also safe but less direct toward remaining food. Thus, **Left** to (3,5) is chosen to path toward (1,1) efficiently.\n\nThis sequence ensures the snake eats the high-value food at (4,4) while avoiding all collisions. It also sets up for future food collection at (1,1) with a safe, uncoiling path that minimizes risk. The food at (5,5) and (2,5) is ignored as it is unreachable within their life spans (Manhattan distance too high).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 83: U\nTurn 84: L\nTurn 85: L\nTurn 86: U\nTurn 87: L\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 84, and I'm playing Snake on a grid from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls at the borders and one internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: The head is at (6,4), and the body segments follow. Let me list them in order:\n\n- Head: (6,4)\n\n- Then (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nThe snake head direction is Up, which means it was moving upwards last turn. So from (6,3) to (6,4), I assume? Positions are given head first, so from (6,3) to (6,4) is up, yes.\n\nNow, food:\n\n- (2,5) with life span 3, value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (1,1) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (4,4) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food here is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value 1 for all.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid. It's 8x8, from x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7. Walls are at borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: I should plot this to visualize.\n\nLet me sketch a grid:\n\ny=7: wall top\n\ny=6: row 6, obstacle at (4,6)\n\ny=5: row 5\n\ny=4: row 4: snake head at (6,4), and (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) but (4,4) is part of snake? Positions: (6,4) head, then body: (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n\n(4,4) is the last position, which is the tail? Let's see the list: positions from head to tail: index 0: (6,4), 1: (6,3), 2: (6,2), 3: (6,1), 4: (5,1), 5: (4,1), 6: (3,1), 7: (2,1), 8: (2,2), 9: (2,2) to (2,3)? Positions: 7: (2,1), 8: (2,2), 9: (2,3), 10: (2,4), 11: (3,4), 12: (3,3), 13: (3,2), 14: (4,2), 15: (5,2), 16: (5,3), 17: (4,3), 18: (4,4)\n\nSo tail is at (4,4).\n\nNow, snake head direction is Up, so it moved to (6,4) from (6,3), I think.\n\nCurrent head at (6,4), direction U, so it came from below, from (6,3).\n\nNow, possible moves: Since head direction is U, I can move U, L, or R, but not D because that would be instant reverse. Rule: no instant reverse, so cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is U, so cannot move D. Can move U, L, R.\n\nNow, grid bounds: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So (0,y) and (7,y) for all y, and (x,0), (x,7) for all x are walls. Also internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nNow, food locations:\n\n- (2,5): value 1, life span 3 (so disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 84, life span 3, so it will be gone by turn 87? Let's see: at turn t, food has life span N, it will disappear after N turns, meaning at turn t+N it is gone? Or at the end of turn t+N-1?\n\nThe rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo at turn t, life span is L, it decreases to L-1 at the end of turn t, and so on, until L=0, it disappears after that turn. I think it means that it is present for turns t to t+L-1, and gone at turn t+L.\n\nFor example, at turn 84, life span 3, so it decreases to 2 at turn 85, to 1 at turn 86, to 0 at turn 87, and disappears after turn 87, so available for turns 84,85,86. Gone at turn 87.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) life span 5: available until turn 88? Turn 84: L=5, 85:L=4, 86:L=3, 87:L=2, 88:L=1, 89:L=0 gone. So available turns 84 to 88.\n\n(4,4) life span 8: available turns 84 to 91.\n\nBut (4,4) is currently occupied by the snake's tail. The food is at (4,4), but snake tail is also at (4,4).\n\nRule about food under body: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nSo for (4,4), since it's under the tail, it can be eaten only if the tail moves away and then head moves to (4,4).\n\nBut tail is at (4,4), and when the snake moves, the tail will move only if the snake doesn't eat food. If it eats food, tail doesn't move, and snake grows.\n\nBut here, if head moves to a food cell, it eats it and grows, so tail stays, but in this case, the food is under the tail, so if head moves to (4,4) while tail is there, it might cause collision.\n\nRule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn this case, head is at (6,4), tail at (4,4). Are they adjacent? (6,4) and (4,4) are not adjacent; they are two cells apart. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (6,4) and (5,4) would be adjacent, or (6,4) and (6,3), etc. (4,4) is not adjacent to (6,4); distance is 2 in x-direction.\n\nSo head is not adjacent to tail; tail is at (4,4), head at (6,4), so not adjacent. Therefore, no immediate danger from that.\n\nBut the food at (4,4) can only be eaten if the snake moves such that the tail moves away first, then head moves to (4,4).\n\nCurrently, tail is at (4,4), so if the snake moves without eating, tail will move to the next position. Let's see the snake body.\n\nPositions: head (6,4), then (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), tail (4,4)\n\nWhen the snake moves, if it doesn't eat, the head moves to a new position, and the tail moves forward, so the cell (4,4) will be vacated.\n\nFor example, if head moves to a non-food cell, tail moves to (4,3) or something? Let's see the body order.\n\nAfter moving, the new head position depends on direction, and the tail position is removed if no growth.\n\nBut for the food at (4,4), since it's under tail, when the snake moves, if it doesn't eat, tail moves away from (4,4), so (4,4) becomes empty, and food is there, so then head can move to it later to eat.\n\nBut if head moves directly to (4,4) now, while tail is there, what happens?\n\nThe rule: \"the head moves onto the food cell\" but if the food is under the body, and body is still there, moving head to it might cause collision.\n\nSpecifically, the rule says: can only be eaten if body moves away first.\n\nSo probably, if head moves to a cell occupied by both food and body, it collides with body, since body is there.\n\nThe rule says: \"1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nSo if body hasn't moved away, moving head to that cell results in collision with body segment.\n\nTherefore, for (4,4), since it's occupied by tail, head cannot move to it now; it would collide with tail.\n\nSimilarly for any body segment.\n\nSo for (4,4) food, we need to move so that tail moves away first, then head can go there.\n\nNow, current turn 84, I need to choose action for turn 84.\n\nPossible moves from (6,4): U, L, R (since direction U, cannot D).\n\n- U (up): to (6,5)\n\n- L (left): to (5,4)\n\n- R (right): to (7,4) but x=7 is wall, so cannot move R, because (7,4) is wall.\n\nx=7 is border wall, so (7,4) is invalid, collision.\n\nSimilarly, D is not allowed due to direction.\n\nSo possible moves: U or L.\n\nU to (6,5) or L to (5,4).\n\nNow, (6,5): is it safe? Let's see what is at (6,5).\n\nFrom snake positions, (6,5) is not listed, so empty? But y=5, x=6.\n\nGrid: y=5, x from 0 to 7, but walls only at borders and (4,6).\n\n(6,5) should be free, unless wall, but walls are at borders, so (6,5) is not wall, and not snake, so empty.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4): is it snake? Snake positions: head (6,4), then (6,3), etc. (5,4) not listed, so empty.\n\nFood: (2,5), (1,1), (4,4) but (4,4) is occupied.\n\n(4,4) has food but is occupied, so not accessible now.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead.\n\nFirst, life span of foods:\n\n- (2,5): life span 3, so must be eaten by turn 86 (since turn 84,85,86 available, gone at 87)\n\n- (1,1): life span 5, available turns 84-88\n\n- (4,4): life span 8, available turns 84-91\n\nBut (4,4) is under tail, so we need to vacate it first.\n\nAlso, the snake is long; let's count segments: positions list has 19 segments? From (6,4) to (4,4), 19 positions, so length 19.\n\nIndex 0 to 18, 19 segments.\n\nNow, to eat (4,4), we need the tail to move away. When the snake moves without eating, the tail moves to the next segment position.\n\nCurrent tail is at (4,4). The segment before tail is (4,3), at position 17: (4,3)\n\nWhen snake moves, if no food eaten, head moves to new position, and tail is removed, so new tail becomes the previous segment 17, which is (4,3), and (4,4) is vacated.\n\nSo after one move without eating, (4,4) is empty, and food is there, so it can be eaten.\n\nSimilarly, if we eat food elsewhere, tail doesn't move, so (4,4) remains occupied.\n\nBut for now, at turn 84, head at (6,4), options U or L.\n\nIf U to (6,5), that's moving up.\n\n(6,5) is empty, no food, so no eat, then snake moves, head to (6,5), tail moves from (4,4) to (4,3)? Let's trace the body.\n\nAfter move: new head at (6,5), then the body segments: previous head (6,4) becomes segment 1, then (6,3) segment 2, and so on, up to segment 18: (4,4) was segment 18, but since no eat, tail is removed, so new tail is segment 17: (4,3)\n\nPositions before move: index 0: (6,4), 1: (6,3), 2: (6,2), 3: (6,1), 4: (5,1), 5: (4,1), 6: (3,1), 7: (2,1), 8: (2,2), 9: (2,3), 10: (2,4), 11: (3,4), 12: (3,3), 13: (3,2), 14: (4,2), 15: (5,2), 16: (5,3), 17: (4,3), 18: (4,4)\n\nAfter moving head to (6,5) without eating, new positions: head (6,5), then segment 1: (6,4), segment 2: (6,3), ..., segment 18: (4,3), and tail segment 17: (4,3) but segment 18 was (4,4), removed, so new tail is segment 17: (4,3)\n\nSegment 17 was (4,3), now it becomes the last segment, tail at (4,3).\n\nAnd (4,4) is now empty, with food.\n\nSimilarly, if move L to (5,4), same thing, no food there, so tail moves to (4,3), (4,4) vacated.\n\n(5,4) is empty, no food.\n\nNow, food at (2,5) has short life, only 3 turns, so we might want to eat it soon.\n\n(1,1) has longer life.\n\n(4,4) has long life but is now accessible after one move.\n\nBut after moving, head is at either (6,5) or (5,4).\n\nLet's think about paths.\n\nFirst, consider moving U to (6,5).\n\nThen head at (6,5), direction now U? After moving U, new direction is U.\n\nThen from (6,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R? But no instant reverse, so since moved U, cannot move D next.\n\nCurrent direction after move: if I move U, new head direction is U.\n\nSimilarly, if I move L, new direction L.\n\nSo if I move U to (6,5), new direction U.\n\nThen from (6,5), possible moves: U to (6,6), L to (5,5), R to (7,5) but x=7 wall, so invalid. D is reverse, invalid. So only U or L.\n\n(6,6): y=6, but y=7 is wall, so (6,6) is not wall, but there is obstacle at (4,6), not at (6,6), so (6,6) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) free.\n\nNow, if I move L to (5,4) at turn 84.\n\nThen head at (5,4), new direction L.\n\nThen from (5,4), possible moves: U to (5,5), D to (5,3), L to (4,4), R to (6,4) but R is reverse? Current direction after move is L, so moving R would be reverse to L, so invalid? Directions: if I moved L to (5,4), I came from (6,4), so direction is left. So moving right would be back to (6,4), which is reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo possible moves: U (up), D (down), L (left), but L to (4,4).\n\nNow (4,4) has food, but after move, if I go to (5,4) at turn 84, then at turn 85, from (5,4), I can move to (4,4).\n\nBut at turn 84, when I move to (5,4), since (5,4) is empty, no eat, so tail moves, and (4,4) is vacated with food.\n\nThen at turn 85, from (5,4), I can move L to (4,4), which has food, so I eat it, grow, and tail doesn't move.\n\nBut is (4,4) adjacent to tail? After turn 84 move to (5,4), tail is at (4,3), as we saw earlier.\n\nAfter move to (5,4), head at (5,4), body: previous head (6,4) now segment 1, then (6,3), ..., down to new tail at (4,3).\n\n(4,4) is vacated, food there.\n\nNow (4,4) and tail at (4,3) are adjacent, since (4,3) and (4,4) share edge.\n\nIf I move head to (4,4), which has positive food, and tail is adjacent at (4,3), then according to \"Tail Reward Danger\", eating it kills the snake, because after eating, the tail doesn't move, so new tail is at the old position, but since head moves to (4,4), and tail was at (4,3), after growth, the new tail is where the tail was, (4,3), but head is at (4,4), so they are adjacent, not colliding yet.\n\nCollision is when head touches body, but after eating, the snake grows, so the segment that was tail stays, and new head is at food position.\n\nSpecifically, when you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail does not move, so the snake gains one segment at the tail.\n\nSo positions: before move, head at (5,4), tail at (4,3).\n\nAfter moving to (4,4) and eating: new head at (4,4), then the previous head (5,4) becomes new segment, and the body follows, with tail still at (4,3), but now the tail is part of the body, and head at (4,4), which is adjacent to tail at (4,3), so they are next to each other, but not colliding; collision only if head moves to a cell occupied by body.\n\nAt (4,4), it was empty except for food, so moving there is fine, but after moving, head is at (4,4), and tail is at (4,3), which is a different cell, so no collision.\n\nThe danger is when you eat, and because tail doesn't move, if head and tail were adjacent before, after growing, they are still adjacent, but if on the next move, the head moves away, it might be ok, but the rule says \"eating it kills the snake\" only if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, but here the food is on the cell we move to, not on tail cell.\n\nLet's read \"Tail Reward Danger\": \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake\"\n\nIn this case, before eating, head is at (5,4), tail at (4,3). Are they adjacent? (5,4) and (4,3) are not adjacent; they are diagonal. Adjacent means sharing edge, so up, down, left, right.\n\n(5,4) and (4,3) are not sharing an edge; (5,4) adjacent to (5,3), (5,5), (4,4), (6,4).\n\n(4,3) adjacent to (4,2), (4,4), (3,3), (5,3).\n\nSo (5,4) and (4,3) are not adjacent; distance is sqrt(2), not adjacent.\n\nTherefore, head is not adjacent to tail before eating.\n\nTail cell is (4,3), which has no food; food is at (4,4), which is different.\n\nSo when I move to (4,4), I eat the food, grow, and no problem.\n\nThen snake grows, tail remains at (4,3), but since we ate, tail doesn't move, so it stays.\n\nThen new head at (4,4), and direction would be L, since moved left from (5,4).\n\nBut in this case, at turn 84, if I move L to (5,4), then at turn 85, I can move L to (4,4) to eat the food.\n\nSimilarly, if I move U first, I might not get to eat (4,4) soon.\n\nBut (4,4) has long life span, so not urgent.\n\nThe urgent food is (2,5) with life span 3, must be eaten by turn 86.\n\n(2,5) is at x=2,y=5.\n\nHead at (6,4), so to reach (2,5), I need to go left and up.\n\nIf I move L to (5,4) at turn 84, then from there, I can go U to (5,5), then L to (4,5), etc., towards (2,5).\n\nIf I move U to (6,5) at turn 84, then from (6,5), I can go L to (5,5) or U to (6,6).\n\nBut (6,6) is close to top wall y=7, and obstacle at (4,6), but (6,6) is free.\n\nNow, let's think about risks.\n\nThe snake body is all over the place; I need to avoid running into myself.\n\nFor example, after moving to (5,4), the body positions.\n\nFirst, let's list the grid to see free cells.\n\nMake a grid:\n\nRows y=0 to 7, columns x=0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacle: (4,6)\n\nSnake positions at turn 84:\n\n(6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nFree cells: all others not wall or obstacle.\n\nFood: (2,5), (1,1), (4,4) but (4,4) occupied, so only (2,5) and (1,1) are accessible now.\n\n(1,1) is at bottom left, (2,5) is left middle.\n\nNow, to eat (2,5), from head (6,4), moving L to (5,4) is a step towards it, then I can go to (5,5) or (4,4) etc.\n\nMoving U to (6,5) is away from (2,5), since (2,5) is left and up, but (6,5) is right and up, so farther.\n\n(6,4) to (2,5): delta x=-4, delta y=+1, so mainly left.\n\n(6,5) to (2,5): delta x=-4, delta y=0, so still left, but same y, x decrease.\n\nBut from (6,5), I can go left to (5,5), (4,5), etc.\n\nBut there might be body in the way.\n\nFor example, from (6,5), if I go L to (5,5), is (5,5) free? Not listed, so yes.\n\nThen to (4,5), etc.\n\nBut at (3,4) and (2,4) are body, so to reach (2,5), I can go to (2,5) from (2,4) or (3,5) or (1,5), but (1,5) might be wall? x=0 wall, so (1,5) is not wall, but borders are walls, so cells like (1,5) are not walls, only x=0, x=7, etc. are walls, so (1,5) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) is free except food.\n\nBut (2,4) is body, (2,3) body, so to reach (2,5), I need to approach from above, below, or left/right, but left is x=1, right x=3.\n\n(2,5) adjacent cells: (2,6), (2,4), (1,5), (3,5)\n\n(2,4) is body, so cannot go there.\n\n(2,6): y=6, but y=7 wall, so (2,6) free? Not listed, so free.\n\n(1,5): free.\n\n(3,5): free? Not listed.\n\n(3,4) is body, but (3,5) not, so free.\n\nSo (2,5) can be approached from (2,6), (1,5), or (3,5).\n\nNow, head at (6,4), if I move U to (6,5), then to (6,6) or (5,5).\n\nIf to (6,6), then from (6,6), I can go L to (5,6), but (5,6) is below obstacle? Obstacle at (4,6), so (5,6) is free, then to (4,6) but (4,6) obstacle, so cannot, so from (5,6) I can go U to (5,7) but y=7 wall, or D to (5,5), or L to (4,6) invalid, or R to (6,6) reverse.\n\nSo from (5,6), possible U/D/L/R but U to (5,7) wall, L to (4,6) obstacle, R to (6,6), but if came from left, direction might be L, so R reverse? Need to track direction.\n\nThis might be messy.\n\nIf I move L to (5,4) at turn 84, then from (5,4), I can go U to (5,5) or L to (4,4) to eat, or D to (5,3).\n\n(5,3) is body? Snake positions: (5,3) is segment 16, body, so cannot go to (5,3).\n\nSimilarly, (5,2) is body, etc.\n\nSo from (5,4), possible moves: U to (5,5), L to (4,4), D to (5,3) but (5,3) body, collision, so invalid. R to (6,4) but reverse, invalid. So only U or L.\n\nIf L to (4,4), and eat, as I thought earlier.\n\nOr U to (5,5).\n\n(5,5) is free, no food.\n\nThen from (5,5), I can go towards (2,5).\n\nFor example, to (4,5), then (3,5), then to (2,5) or (3,5) to (2,5).\n\n(3,5) to (2,5) is left, adjacent.\n\n(3,5) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) free.\n\nNow, life span: (2,5) must be eaten by turn 86, so in the next 3 turns: 84,85,86.\n\nTurn 84: I move now.\n\nIf I move L to (5,4) at turn 84, then at turn 85, I can move U to (5,5) or L to (4,4).\n\nIf I move L to (4,4) at turn 85, I eat (4,4), grow, but then I'm at (4,4), and (2,5) is still to be eaten, but I have until turn 86.\n\nFrom (4,4), after eating, head at (4,4), direction L (since moved left).\n\nThen from (4,4), possible moves: U to (4,5), D to (4,3), L to (3,4), R to (5,4) but R is reverse? Moved L to (4,4), so direction L, moving R to (5,4) is reverse, invalid.\n\nU to (4,5), D to (4,3), L to (3,4).\n\n(4,3) is body? After eating, the body: when I ate at (4,4), head moved to (4,4), and since I ate, tail didn't move, so tail is still at (4,3) from before, but (4,3) is now part of body.\n\nBefore eating at turn 85: at turn 84, I moved to (5,4), so positions: head (5,4), then (6,4), (6,3), ..., tail (4,3)\n\nThen at turn 85, I move L to (4,4) and eat, so new head (4,4), then (5,4), (6,4), ..., and tail at (4,3) stays, so body includes (4,3) and all previous except tail was removed only if no eat, but with eat, tail stays, so positions: head (4,4), then (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), ..., down to (4,3) as new last segment.\n\nSo (4,3) is body, so from (4,4), moving D to (4,3) would be collision, since (4,3) is body.\n\nSimilarly, L to (3,4): (3,4) is body, segment 11 in original, but after moves, it might be different.\n\nOriginal at turn 84, (3,4) is segment 11.\n\nAfter turn 84 move to (5,4), new positions: head (5,4), segment1: (6,4), segment2: (6,3), ..., let's list:\n\nNew after turn 84 to (5,4): head (5,4), then previous head (6,4) now body, then (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3)  -- and (4,4) removed, tail at (4,3)\n\nSo positions: (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3)  -- 19 segments? Head (5,4), then 18 body segments, tail (4,3), so 19 segments still.\n\nThen at turn 85, move to (4,4) and eat, so new head (4,4), then (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), ..., down to (4,3), and since ate, tail doesn't move, so new tail is the old tail position, (4,3), but it is now part of the body, and a new segment is added at the tail, but no: when you eat, the head moves to food, and you gain a segment, so the tail stays in place, meaning the last segment remains, and the snake elongates.\n\nPositions after eating: new head at (4,4), then the previous head (5,4) becomes first body segment, then the rest, and the tail (4,3) remains as the last segment. So now the snake has 20 segments: head (4,4), then (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), tail (4,3)\n\nSo (4,3) is tail, at position (4,3).\n\nFrom head (4,4), adjacent cells: (4,5) up, (4,3) down, (3,4) left, (5,4) right.\n\n(4,3) is tail, (5,4) is body (second segment), (3,4) is body (it was segment 13 in new list? Head (4,4), then (5,4) segment 1, (6,4) segment 2, ..., (3,4) is in the list, for example, after (2,4) is (3,4), so (3,4) is body.\n\nSpecifically, from above: positions: 0: (4,4) head, 1: (5,4), 2: (6,4), 3: (6,3), 4: (6,2), 5: (6,1), 6: (5,1), 7: (4,1), 8: (3,1), 9: (2,1), 10: (2,2), 11: (2,3), 12: (2,4), 13: (3,4), 14: (3,3), 15: (3,2), 16: (4,2), 17: (5,2), 18: (5,3), 19: (4,3) tail\n\nSo from head (4,4), moving D to (4,3) is tail, but since it's the tail, and we can move to tail because it will move, but (4,3) is occupied by tail, and we are not eating food there, so moving to (4,3) would be moving to a body cell, collision, because it's not the tail in a way that it moves away; but rule is, moving to a cell occupied by body is deadly, except for the tail cell, because when you move, the tail moves away.\n\nGeneral rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo if the head moves to the tail cell, it is allowed, because the tail will move, so no collision.\n\nIn this case, (4,3) is tail, so moving to (4,3) is safe, as long as no food or something, but here no food at (4,3), so it's like moving to an empty cell, but the cell is occupied by tail, but since tail moves, it's ok.\n\nSimilarly, moving to (3,4) which is body, not tail, would be collision.\n\nMoving to (5,4) body, collision.\n\nMoving to (4,5) empty, safe.\n\nSo from (4,4), possible moves:\n\nU to (4,5): empty, safe\n\nD to (4,3): tail cell, safe (since tail will move)\n\nL to (3,4): body cell, collision, invalid\n\nR to (5,4): body cell, collision, invalid\n\nAlso, direction: after moving L to (4,4), new direction L, so moving R would be reverse, invalid anyway.\n\nSo possible moves: U or D.\n\nU to (4,5) or D to (4,3).\n\nBut if I do this at turn 85, I need to eat (2,5) by turn 86.\n\nFrom (4,4), if I go U to (4,5), then at (4,5), I can go to (3,5) or (4,6) or (5,5), but (4,6) obstacle, so to (3,5) or (5,5).\n\nThen to (2,5) from (3,5) or from (1,5) etc.\n\nBut (2,5) is at (2,5), so from (3,5) I can move L to (2,5) at turn 86 or 87.\n\nTurn 86 is the last turn to eat (2,5), since life span 3 at turn 84, so at turn 86, life span: at turn 84, L=3, turn 85 L=2, turn 86 L=1, turn 87 L=0 gone. So must eat on or before turn 86.\n\nIf at turn 84 I move L to (5,4), then at turn 85 I move L to (4,4) and eat, now at (4,4) at turn 85.\n\nThen at turn 86, I need to move towards (2,5). From (4,4), I can move U to (4,5), then at (4,5), I can move L to (3,5), then at turn 87, but turn 87 (2,5) is gone, so I need to be at (2,5) by turn 86.\n\nFrom (4,4) at turn 85, after moving U to (4,5) at turn 86? Turn 86 action.\n\nAt turn 85, head at (4,4)\n\nTurn 86: move from (4,4) to, say, U to (4,5)\n\nThen at (4,5), not (2,5), so not eaten.\n\nThen at turn 86, (2,5) still there, life span 1, so I can eat at turn 86 if I am at (2,5).\n\nBut from (4,5) at turn 86, I can move to (3,5) or (4,6) invalid or (5,5), not directly to (2,5).\n\n(4,5) to (2,5) is two steps away, so I cannot reach (2,5) in one move from (4,5).\n\nSimilarly, if from (4,4) at turn 85, I move D to (4,3), then at (4,3), which is tail, but after moving, tail moves, etc., but (4,3) is away from (2,5), so harder to reach.\n\nSo if I eat (4,4) at turn 85, I might not be able to reach (2,5) by turn 86.\n\nAt turn 84, instead of eating (4,4), I can go towards (2,5) directly.\n\nFor example, at turn 84, move L to (5,4), then at turn 85, move U to (5,5), then at turn 86, move L to (4,5), but (4,5) to (2,5) is not adjacent, (4,5) to (3,5) to (2,5), so at turn 86 from (4,5) I can move to (3,5), but not to (2,5), so (2,5) not eaten at turn 86.\n\nIf at turn 85 from (5,4) I move U to (5,5), then at (5,5), I can move L to (4,5) at turn 86, still not (2,5).\n\nTo reach (2,5) by turn 86, I need to be at an adjacent cell at turn 85.\n\nAt turn 84, head at (6,4)\n\nAfter move, if I move L to (5,4), then at turn 85 head at (5,4)\n\nFrom (5,4), possible moves U to (5,5), L to (4,4), D invalid, R invalid.\n\n(5,4) to (2,5) is not adjacent; adjacent cells are (5,5), (5,3), (4,4), (6,4)\n\n(5,3) body, (6,4) body, so only (5,5) or (4,4)\n\nNeither is (2,5), so from (5,4) at turn 85, I cannot move directly to (2,5), so I cannot eat it at turn 85.\n\nSimilarly, if I move U at turn 84 to (6,5), then at turn 85 at (6,5), still far.\n\nSo to eat (2,5) at turn 86, I need to be at (2,5) at turn 86, so at turn 85, I need to be at an adjacent cell: (2,6), (2,4), (1,5), (3,5)\n\n(2,4) is body, so not accessible, so only (2,6), (1,5), (3,5)\n\nAt turn 85, head must be at one of these to move to (2,5) at turn 86.\n\nAt turn 84, after move, head at new position.\n\nIf I move L to (5,4) at turn 84, then at turn 85, head at (5,4), which is not adjacent to any of (2,6), (1,5), (3,5). (5,4) to (3,5) is not adjacent; distance.\n\nSo I cannot reach those cells from (5,4) in zero moves.\n\nSimilarly, if I move U to (6,5) at turn 84, at turn 85 at (6,5), still not close.\n\nSo it seems impossible to eat (2,5) at turn 85 or 86 from current position, because at turn 85, I can't be at a cell adjacent to (2,5) except possibly if I move directly, but from (6,4) to (2,5) is too far in one move.\n\nAt turn 84, I am at (6,4), after move to (5,4) or (6,5), then at turn 85, I am at that cell, which is not adjacent to (2,5), and at turn 86, I can move to a cell, but from there, it might be possible to reach an adjacent cell in one move, but not to (2,5) directly unless I am adjacent at turn 85.\n\nTo be at (2,5) at turn 86, I need to move there from my position at turn 85.\n\nMy position at turn 85 must be adjacent to (2,5).\n\nSo at turn 85, head must be at (2,6), (1,5), or (3,5).\n\nNow, at turn 84, I am at (6,4).\n\nCan I reach (2,6), (1,5), or (3,5) by turn 85? That's one move from turn 84 to turn 85.\n\nFrom (6,4), possible moves to (6,5) U, or (5,4) L.\n\n(6,5) is not (2,6), (1,5), or (3,5).\n\n(5,4) is not.\n\nSo I cannot be at an adjacent cell to (2,5) at turn 85, therefore I cannot eat (2,5) at turn 86, because I can't be at (2,5) at turn 86.\n\nTurn 86 is when I move to it.\n\nAt turn 86, I move to a cell; to eat (2,5), I move to (2,5) at turn 86.\n\nThat means at the start of turn 86, I am at a cell adjacent to (2,5), and I move to it.\n\nSo at turn 85, after my move, I must be at a cell adjacent to (2,5).\n\nBut from turn 84, after move, I am at (5,4) or (6,5), neither of which is adjacent to (2,5).\n\nAnd from there, at turn 85, I can move, but to reach (2,6), (1,5), or (3,5) from (5,4) or (6,5) in one move is impossible; for example from (5,4) to (3,5) is not adjacent, too far.\n\nSimilarly, from (6,5) to (3,5) not adjacent.\n\nSo it is impossible to eat (2,5) at all, because the earliest I can be adjacent is later, but life span ends at turn 86.\n\nLet's calculate the minimum turns to reach (2,5) from (6,4).\n\nFrom (6,4) to (2,5): need to decrease x by 4, increase y by 1.\n\nEach move changes x or y by 1.\n\nSo minimum 4 moves if I go directly left and up.\n\nFor example, L to (5,4), L to (4,4) but (4,4) might be occupied, but after move it's free, then to (3,4) but (3,4) is body, so cannot, or to (4,5), then to (3,5), then to (2,5).\n\nPath: from (6,4) to (5,4) L, then to (5,5) U, then to (4,5) L, then to (3,5) L, then to (2,5) L, but that's 4 moves to (2,5), but from (3,5) to (2,5) is one move.\n\nFrom (6,4) to (5,4) turn 84, to (5,5) turn 85, to (4,5) turn 86, to (3,5) turn 87, to (2,5) turn 88, but at turn 87, (2,5) is gone.\n\nIf I go faster, but there are body blocks.\n\nFor example, from (6,4) U to (6,5) turn 84, then L to (5,5) turn 85, then L to (4,5) turn 86, then L to (3,5) turn 87, then to (2,5) turn 88, same.\n\nOr from (6,5) U to (6,6) turn 85, then L to (5,6) turn 86, etc., not better.\n\nCan I go to (3,5) directly? No, because of body.\n\nThe only way is if I can go through existing paths, but (2,4) is body, (3,4) is body, so I cannot go to those cells.\n\nSo to reach (2,5), I must come from (2,6), (1,5), or (3,5).\n\n(2,6) is free, (1,5) free, (3,5) free.\n\nFrom current (6,4) to (3,5): delta x=-3, delta y=1, so min 3 moves: e.g. L to (5,4), then U to (5,5), then L to (4,5), then to (3,5) next.\n\nAfter 3 moves, at (4,5) or something.\n\nFrom (6,4) to (3,5):\n\nMove 1: L to (5,4)\n\nMove 2: U to (5,5)\n\nMove 3: L to (4,5)\n\nThen at (4,5), which is not (3,5); to (3,5) is another move.\n\nMove 4: L to (3,5)\n\nThen from (3,5) to (2,5) move 5.\n\nSo 5 moves to reach (2,5) from (6,4).\n\nAt turn 84, after move, at new position turn 85.\n\nTurn 84 move to say (5,4), turn 85 at (5,4)\n\nThen turn 85 move to (5,5), turn 86 at (5,5)\n\nTurn 86 move to (4,5), turn 87 at (4,5)\n\nTurn 87 move to (3,5), turn 88 at (3,5)\n\nTurn 88 move to (2,5), turn 89 at (2,5)\n\nBut (2,5) life span: at turn 84 L=3, turn 85 L=2, turn 86 L=1, turn 87 L=0 gone, so at turn 87 it is gone, so I can only eat it on or before turn 86.\n\nTurn 86 is the last chance; at turn 86, if I move to (2,5), I eat it.\n\nBut to move to (2,5) at turn 86, I need to be at adjacent cell at turn 85.\n\nAt turn 85, I must be at (2,6), (1,5), or (3,5).\n\nBut from turn 84 position, I can't reach any of these in one move.\n\nFor example, at turn 84 after move, I am at (5,4) or (6,5).\n\nFrom (5,4) at turn 85, I can move to (5,5) or (4,4), not to (3,5) or (2,6) etc.\n\nSimilarly from (6,5) to (5,5) or (6,6), not to those.\n\nSo it is impossible to eat (2,5) because it will disappear before I can reach it.\n\nTherefore, I should not worry about (2,5); it will expire uneaten.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) has life span 5, so available until turn 88, and (4,4) available long time.\n\nSo for turn 84, I should focus on eating (4,4) or other.\n\nBut (4,4) is under tail, but after one move, it is free.\n\nSo at turn 84, if I move L to (5,4), then at turn 85, I can move L to (4,4) and eat it.\n\nIf I move U to (6,5), then I might not eat (4,4) soon.\n\nSince (2,5) is unreachable, I can ignore it.\n\nThen, eating (4,4) gives +1 score and growth.\n\n(1,1) is far away, at bottom left.\n\nAfter eating (4,4), I can plan to eat (1,1) later.\n\nAlso, there might be risks.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (4,6), and walls.\n\nBut for now, let's choose the move.\n\nIf I move L to (5,4) at turn 84, then at turn 85 move L to (4,4) and eat.\n\nThen at turn 85, head at (4,4), direction L.\n\nThen possible moves U or D, as I thought.\n\nU to (4,5) or D to (4,3).\n\n(4,5) is free, (4,3) is tail, so moving to (4,3) is safe.\n\nBut moving to (4,3) might not be good for long term, as it might lead to dead ends.\n\nSince I need to maximize score, eating (4,4) is good.\n\nIf I move U at turn 84 to (6,5), then from there, I can go to (6,6) or (5,5), etc., but I might not eat any food soon, and (4,4) might be eaten later, but I can go to it.\n\nBut moving U might lead to top area, which has obstacle.\n\nLet's see the grid size; y=6 has obstacle at (4,6), so at (6,6), I can go L to (5,6), then from (5,6), I can go U to (5,7) wall, D to (5,5), L to (4,6) obstacle, R to (6,6), so only D to (5,5).\n\nThen from (5,5), I can go to (4,5) or (5,4) etc.\n\nBut it might take more turns to eat (4,4).\n\nSo for immediate score, moving L to (5,4) and then to (4,4) is better.\n\nAlso, for long-term, after eating (4,4), I am at (4,4), with tail at (4,3), and I can move to (4,5) or (4,3).\n\nIf I move to (4,5), then I can go left to (3,5), (2,5) but (2,5) gone, or down to (3,4) but (3,4) body, etc.\n\nPerhaps I can go towards (1,1).\n\n(1,1) is at bottom left, available until turn 88.\n\nFrom (4,4), if I go U to (4,5), then L to (3,5), then D to (3,4) but (3,4) body, not possible, or to (2,5) gone, or to (3,6) but y=6, (3,6) free? Then to (2,6), etc., not towards (1,1).\n\nFrom (4,4), if I move D to (4,3), which is tail, so safe, move to (4,3), then since no food, tail moves, etc.\n\nAfter moving to (4,3), head at (4,3), new direction D.\n\nThen from (4,3), possible moves: U to (4,4) but (4,4) is now body? After moving to (4,3) from (4,4), let's see.\n\nAt turn 85, after eating at (4,4), head at (4,4), tail at (4,3)\n\nIf at turn 86, I move D to (4,3), since (4,3) is tail, and no food, so head moves to (4,3), tail moves away to the next, which was (5,3) or something.\n\nPositions after turn 85: head (4,4), body: (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), ..., tail (4,3)\n\nIf move D to (4,3), which is tail cell, no food, so head moves to (4,3), and tail is removed, so new tail is the previous segment, which was (5,3) or in the list, segment 18: (5,3)\n\nList: 0: (4,4), 1: (5,4), 2: (6,4), 3: (6,3), 4: (6,2), 5: (6,1), 6: (5,1), 7: (4,1), 8: (3,1), 9: (2,1), 10: (2,2), 11: (2,3), 12: (2,4), 13: (3,4), 14: (3,3), 15: (3,2), 16: (4,2), 17: (5,2), 18: (5,3), 19: (4,3) tail\n\nAfter moving to (4,3) without eating, new head at (4,3), then segments: (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), ..., down to (5,3), and tail removed, so new tail at (5,3)\n\n(4,3) vacated but no food.\n\nThen head at (4,3), direction D.\n\nThen I can move to (4,2), (4,4), (3,3), (5,3) but (5,3) is tail, (4,4) is body, etc.\n\nBut this might not be efficient.\n\nSince (1,1) is available, and it's positive food, I should plan to eat it.\n\nFrom current position, after eating (4,4), I am at (4,4), which is closer to (1,1) than (6,4).\n\n(4,4) to (1,1): delta x=-3, delta y=-3, so min 6 moves.\n\nBut with body, need path.\n\nFor example, from (4,4) move D to (4,3), then to (4,2) but (4,2) is body, collision, or to (3,3) or (5,3).\n\n(4,2) is body, so cannot.\n\nMove L to (3,4) but (3,4) body.\n\nFrom (4,4) only U or D possible.\n\nU to (4,5) or D to (4,3).\n\nIf D to (4,3), as above.\n\nThen from (4,3), I can move D to (4,2) but (4,2) is body, collision, U to (4,4) body, L to (3,3), R to (5,3).\n\n(3,3) and (5,3) may be free or body.\n\nIn the list, at turn 85, (3,3) is body (segment 14), (5,3) is body (segment 18), so both occupied, so from (4,3), moving L to (3,3) collision, R to (5,3) collision, U to (4,4) body, D to (4,2) body, so all moves invalid? But that can't be.\n\nAfter moving to (4,3) at turn 86, positions: head at (4,3), then (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3) -- tail at (5,3)\n\nSo cells: (4,3) is head, (4,4) is body, (4,2) is body, (3,3) is body, (5,3) is body.\n\nAdjacent cells: (4,4) body, (4,2) body, (3,3) body, (5,3) body, all occupied, so no possible move, snake dies.\n\nOh no! So if I move D to (4,3) from (4,4), I get stuck and die.\n\nTherefore, from (4,4), I must move U to (4,5), not D.\n\nAt turn 85, after eating at (4,4), I must move U to (4,5) to avoid death.\n\nThen at (4,5), head, direction U.\n\nThen from (4,5), possible moves: U to (4,6) but (4,6) obstacle, invalid; D to (4,4) body, invalid; L to (3,5); R to (5,5)\n\n(3,5) and (5,5) should be free.\n\nSo move L to (3,5) or R to (5,5).\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut since (2,5) is gone, and (1,1) is there, I can go towards (1,1).\n\nFor example, from (4,5) move L to (3,5), then to (3,4) but (3,4) body, or to (2,5) gone, or to (3,6) if possible.\n\ny=6, (3,6) free? But (4,6) obstacle, so (3,6) should be free.\n\nThen to (2,6), (1,6), etc., down to (1,1).\n\nBut it might take time.\n\nBack to turn 84 decision.\n\nIf I move U at turn 84 to (6,5), then I avoid the risk but might not eat soon.\n\nBut I can still eat (4,4) later.\n\nFor example, from (6,5), I can go L to (5,5), then to (5,4), then to (4,4) if available.\n\nAt turn 84, move U to (6,5), no eat, tail moves, (4,4) vacated with food.\n\nThen at turn 85, from (6,5), move L to (5,5), no eat.\n\nThen at turn 86, from (5,5), move L to (4,5), no eat.\n\nThen at turn 87, from (4,5), move D to (4,4) and eat.\n\nSo I eat at turn 87.\n\nSimilarly, I can eat (4,4) later.\n\nBut in the first option, I eat at turn 85.\n\nSo eating earlier is better for score, and also I can then plan for other food.\n\nMoreover, in the U move, I might go to areas with less space.\n\nSo I think moving L at turn 84 to (5,4) is better, then L to (4,4) at turn 85 to eat.\n\nThen at turn 85, move U to (4,5) to avoid death.\n\nThen from there, I can go towards (1,1).\n\n(1,1) life span 5, so at turn 84, available until turn 88, so I have time.\n\nTurn 84 to turn 88: 5 turns to eat.\n\nAt turn 85 after eating (4,4), head at (4,4), move U to (4,5) at turn 85? Turn 85: after moving to (4,4) and eating, it's the end of turn 85, so at turn 86, I move from (4,4).\n\nLet's clarify the turn sequence.\n\nTurn t: I choose action, move, then state update.\n\nAt start of turn 84, state as given.\n\nI choose action for turn 84, say move L to (5,4), since no food, no eat, positions update, tail moves to (4,3), (4,4) vacated with food.\n\nNow turn 85, head at (5,4), direction L.\n\nI choose move L to (4,4), which has food, so eat, grow, head now at (4,4), direction L.\n\nNow turn 86, I must move from (4,4), and as we saw, only U or D possible, and D leads to death, so I must move U to (4,5).\n\nThen at (4,5), turn 86, direction U.\n\nThen I can move to (3,5) or (5,5).\n\n(1,1) is at (1,1), so I need to go left and down.\n\nFor example, move L to (3,5) at turn 86.\n\nThen at (3,5), direction L.\n\nThen from (3,5), possible moves: U to (3,6), D to (3,4), L to (2,5), R to (4,5).\n\n(2,5) has food but life span: at turn 84 L=3, turn 85 L=2, turn 86 L=1, so at turn 86, it is still there, L=1.\n\nAt turn 86, when I move, if I move to (2,5), I can eat it.\n\nFrom (3,5) at turn 86, I can move L to (2,5) and eat, since (2,5) is there.\n\n(2,5) life span at turn 86 is 1, so if I eat it at turn 86, I get it.\n\nOtherwise, after turn 86, it disappears.\n\nSo at turn 86, from (3,5), I can move L to (2,5) to eat.\n\nBut (2,5) is adjacent to (2,4) which is body, but if I move to (2,5), it should be fine as long as no collision.\n\n(2,5) is free, no body, so I can move to it.\n\nThen I eat (2,5) at turn 86.\n\nThen I get another point.\n\nIn this case, by moving L at turn 84, I can eat (4,4) at turn 85 and (2,5) at turn 86 if I go that way.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 84: move L to (5,4)\n\nTurn 85: move L to (4,4) eat (4,4)\n\nTurn 86: move U to (4,5)\n\nBut at turn 86, from (4,4) to (4,5), but after turn 85, head at (4,4), at turn 86 move to (4,5).\n\nThen at (4,5), I can move to (3,5) or (5,5).\n\nIf I want to eat (2,5), at turn 86 from (4,5), I move L to (3,5), then at turn 87, from (3,5) I can move to (2,5) but at turn 87, (2,5) is gone, since life span 1 at turn 86, after turn 86 it decreases to 0, gone.\n\nAt turn 86, life span 1, after I move on turn 86, if I eat it, I get it; if not, at end of turn 86, life span decreases to 0, gone for turn 87.\n\nSo to eat at turn 86, I need to be at (2,5) at turn 86.\n\nBut at turn 86, from above, after turn 85, head at (4,4), I move to (4,5) at turn 86, so at (4,5), not at (2,5).\n\nFrom (4,5) at turn 86, I cannot reach (2,5) in one move.\n\nIf at turn 85, after eating at (4,4), at turn 86 I don't move U, but I have to, because D is invalid.\n\nOnly U is safe.\n\nSo I cannot eat (2,5) at turn 86.\n\nBut at turn 85, when I am at (5,4), instead of moving L to (4,4), I can move U to (5,5), then at turn 86 from (5,5) move L to (4,5), then at turn 87 to (3,5), but (2,5) gone.\n\nStill not.\n\nSo (2,5) cannot be eaten; it will expire.\n\nTherefore, I should not consider it.\n\nFor turn 84, best to move L to (5,4), then at turn 85 move L to (4,4) to eat, then at turn 86 move U to (4,5), then from there go towards (1,1).\n\n(1,1) life span 5, at turn 84, so available turns 84,85,86,87,88. Gone at turn 89.\n\nAt turn 86, head at (4,5) after moving U.\n\nThen I can go to (3,5), then to (3,6) or (2,5) gone, or down to (3,4) body, not possible.\n\nFrom (3,5), move to (3,6) if possible, but y=6, (3,6) free.\n\nThen to (2,6), then to (1,6), then down to (1,1).\n\nFor example, from (4,5) at turn 86, move L to (3,5)\n\nTurn 87: from (3,5) move U to (3,6)\n\nTurn 88: from (3,6) move L to (2,6)\n\nTurn 89: from (2,6) move L to (1,6)\n\nTurn 90: from (1,6) move D to (1,5)\n\nAnd so on, down to (1,1), but at turn 88, (1,1) is still available? Turn 88 L=1 for (1,1), so at turn 88 I can eat if at (1,1).\n\nBut from (1,6) to (1,1) is 5 moves down, so not by turn 88.\n\nAt turn 86 head at (4,5), to (1,1) min 5 moves: e.g. (4,5) to (3,5) to (2,5) gone, better (3,5) to (3,6) to (2,6) to (1,6) to (1,5) to (1,4) to (1,3) to (1,2) to (1,1), many moves.\n\nFrom (4,5) move R to (5,5), then to (5,4), but (5,4) may be body.\n\nAfter turn 86 at (4,5), body positions depend on previous.\n\nBut it's complicated, and (1,1) might not be reachable in time if I go up.\n\nSince the snake is long, the bottom area might be crowded.\n\n(1,1) is at (1,1), and there are body segments at (2,1), (3,1), etc.\n\nFrom current, the path to (1,1) might be blocked.\n\nFor example, cells around (1,1): (1,2), (1,0) wall, (2,1), (0,1) wall.\n\n(2,1) is body, so only (1,2) might be accessible.\n\nThen from (1,2) to (1,1) down.\n\nBut (1,2) is body? At turn 84, (1,2) not listed, snake positions: (2,1), (2,2), etc., not (1,2), so (1,2) free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) free except food.\n\nTo eat (1,1), I need to be at (1,2) and move down to (1,1).\n\nOr from (2,1) but (2,1) body, not accessible.\n\nOr from (1,0) wall, no.\n\nSo only from (1,2).\n\nAt some turn, be at (1,2), then move D to (1,1) to eat.\n\nBut with life span, I have until turn 88 to be at (1,2) to move to (1,1) at turn 88.\n\nTurn 88 move to (1,1), so at turn 87, be at (1,2).\n\nNow from turn 84, after moves, I can try to reach (1,2) by turn 87.\n\nBut with the body, it might be difficult.\n\nFor example, if I move L at turn 84 to (5,4), turn 85 move L to (4,4) eat, turn 86 move U to (4,5), then at turn 86 at (4,5), I need to go to (1,2) in one move? No, in multiple moves.\n\nFrom (4,5) to (1,2): delta x=-3, delta y=-3, min 6 moves, but with body, more.\n\nAt turn 86, I am at (4,5), turn 87 at some cell, turn 88 at some cell, to be at (1,2) at turn 87.\n\nFrom (4,5) to (1,2) in one move impossible.\n\nMinimum 3 moves: e.g. L to (3,5), then L to (2,5) but (2,5) gone, or (3,5) to (3,4) body, not possible.\n\n(3,5) to (2,5) gone, to (3,6), to (2,6), to (1,6), then to (1,5), to (1,4), to (1,3), to (1,2), many moves.\n\nNot by turn 87.\n\nSo (1,1) might also be unreachable in time.\n\nLife span 5, from turn 84, so at turn 88, L=1, can be eaten at turn 88.\n\nTo eat at turn 88, be at (1,2) at turn 87.\n\nAt turn 84, I am at (6,4) or after move at (5,4).\n\nTurn 85 at (5,4) or (4,4) if I eat.\n\nAssume I move L at turn 84 to (5,4), turn 85 at (5,4), then I can move U to (5,5) or L to (4,4).\n\nIf I move U to (5,5) at turn 85, then at (5,5), turn 85.\n\nThen turn 86 move L to (4,5), turn 87 at (4,5), not (1,2).\n\nFrom (5,5) move to (5,4) but (5,4) body after move, etc.\n\nIt seems hard to reach (1,2) quickly.\n\nPerhaps it's better to not chase (1,1) and focus on survival and eating (4,4) which is easy.\n\n(4,4) is guaranteed if I go for it.\n\nAlso, after eating, I can explore.\n\nFor turn 84, I think moving L to (5,4) is the best choice.\n\nThen for turn 85, move L to (4,4) to eat.\n\nThen for turn 86, move U to (4,5).\n\nThen for later turns, I can decide based on state.\n\nBut the answer should include multiple turns.\n\nThe format is to output actions for turn 84, 85, 86, etc., but since the state changes, I need to specify for a few turns.\n\n\"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions for the current and future turns based on plan.\n\nSince food life spans, I can plan.\n\nBut for now, let's output for turn 84 and 85.\n\nThen for turn 86, from (4,4) move U to (4,5).\n\nThen at (4,5), I can move to (3,5) or (5,5).\n\nSay move L to (3,5) at turn 86.\n\nThen at (3,5), move U to (3,6) at turn 87, etc.\n\nBut not necessary.\n\nSince (4,4) has long life, but I eat it early.\n\nAnother food is (1,1), but I may not reach it.\n\nSo for turn 84: move L (left)\n\nTurn 85: move L to eat (4,4)\n\nTurn 86: move U to (4,5)\n\nThen for turn 87, from (4,5), say move L to (3,5)\n\nTurn 88: move U to (3,6)\n\n etc.\n\nBut I think for the answer, I can provide the first few actions.\n\nThe format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nSo for turn 84 and 85.\n\nBut to be safe, let's do it.\n\nCurrent head direction U, so from (6,4), move L to (5,4).\n\nThen at (5,4), direction L, move L to (4,4) eat.\n\nThen at (4,4), direction L, move U to (4,5).\n\nThen from (4,5), direction U, I can move L to (3,5) or R to (5,5).\n\nI think L to (3,5) is towards the left side.\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut for the answer, I think providing turn 84 and 85 is sufficient, as the state changes.\n\nSince \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan a sequence.\n\nBut for now, I think moving L at turn 84 is best.\n\nIf I move U at turn 84 to (6,5), then at turn 85 from (6,5) move L to (5,5), then at turn 86 from (5,5) move L to (4,5), then at turn 87 from (4,5) move D to (4,4) eat.\n\nBut I eat later, and I might miss (2,5) but it's gone anyway.\n\nSo first option is better to eat sooner.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with moving L at turn 84.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, the AI must plan at least 5 turns ahead, considering the food life spans, movement constraints, and collision risks. The current state (turn 84) has the snake head at (6,4) with direction Up. The available positive food includes (2,5) with life span 3 (must be eaten by turn 86), (1,1) with life span 5 (must be eaten by turn 88), and (4,4) with life span 8 (must be eaten by turn 91). However, (4,4) is currently under the tail and can only be eaten after the tail moves away.\n\n### Analysis and 5-Turn Plan:\n1. **Turn 84 (Current Turn)**: \n   - From (6,4), possible moves are Up (to (6,5)), Left (to (5,4)), or Right (to (7,4)). Right is invalid due to the wall at x=7. \n   - Moving Left to (5,4) is optimal because:\n     - It avoids the risk of moving Up towards the top wall (y=7) and internal obstacle (4,6), which could limit future moves.\n     - It positions the snake closer to (4,4), allowing it to be eaten soon after the tail vacates the cell.\n     - (2,5) is unreachable by turn 86 due to distance and body blocks, so it will expire uneaten and should not be prioritized.\n     - (1,1) is too far to reach by turn 88 with the current snake length and body positions, so it is not a short-term priority.\n   - Action: Move Left (L) to (5,4). No food is eaten, so the tail moves from (4,4) to (4,3), vacating (4,4) with the food now accessible.\n\n2. **Turn 85**:\n   - Head is at (5,4) with direction Left (from the previous move). Possible moves are Up (to (5,5)), Left (to (4,4)), or Down (to (5,3)). Down is invalid as (5,3) is a body segment. Up is safe but delays eating.\n   - Moving Left to (4,4) is optimal because:\n     - (4,4) has been vacated and contains positive food (+1 score, snake growth).\n     - The head is not adjacent to the tail (tail is at (4,3), which is diagonal, not edge-adjacent), so \"Tail Reward Danger\" does not apply.\n     - Eating now secures an immediate reward and growth, improving long-term survival by increasing length.\n   - Action: Move Left (L) to (4,4) to eat the food. Snake grows, and tail remains at (4,3).\n\n3. **Turn 86**:\n   - Head is at (4,4) with direction Left (from previous move). Possible moves are Up (to (4,5)), Down (to (4,3)), Left (to (3,4)), or Right (to (5,4)). Left and Right are invalid due to body collisions ( (3,4) and (5,4) are body segments). Down to (4,3) is the tail cell, but moving there risks immediate death on the next turn due to body entrapment (as analyzed). \n   - Moving Up to (4,5) is the only safe option:\n     - (4,5) is empty and not a wall or body.\n     - It avoids the bottom area where the body is dense, reducing collision risk.\n     - It provides access to open spaces for future moves.\n   - Action: Move Up (U) to (4,5).\n\n4. **Turn 87**:\n   - Head is at (4,5) with direction Up (from previous move). Possible moves are Up (to (4,6)), Down (to (4,4)), Left (to (3,5)), or Right (to (5,5)). Up is invalid ( (4,6) is an obstacle). Down is invalid ( (4,4) is a body segment). \n   - Moving Left to (3,5) is optimal:\n     - (3,5) is empty and safe.\n     - It moves toward the left side of the grid, which has fewer body segments and potential paths to explore for future food (e.g., (1,1) if reachable later).\n     - Avoids moving Right toward the center where the body is more congested.\n   - Action: Move Left (L) to (3,5).\n\n5. **Turn 88**:\n   - Head is at (3,5) with direction Left (from previous move). Possible moves are Up (to (3,6)), Down (to (3,4)), Left (to (2,5)), or Right (to (4,5)). Down is invalid ( (3,4) is a body segment). Left to (2,5) is invalid (food expired after turn 86). Right is reverse direction, invalid.\n   - Moving Up to (3,6) is optimal:\n     - (3,6) is empty and safe (no wall or body; internal obstacle at (4,6) does not affect this).\n     - It continues toward open areas (e.g., top-left) for survival, avoiding the riskier bottom.\n     - Positions the snake to potentially access (1,1) via a longer path if feasible, but survival is prioritized over this low-probability reward.\n   - Action: Move Up (U) to (3,6).\n\n### Key Considerations for Long-Term Survival:\n- **Food Prioritization**: (4,4) was eaten early for immediate growth. (2,5) and (1,1) were deprioritized due to unreachability within their life spans, avoiding unnecessary risks.\n- **Collision Avoidance**: The plan avoids body collisions and dead ends (e.g., not moving Down from (4,4) on turn 86, which would cause entrapment).\n- **Movement Constraints**: No instant reverses are performed, and wall/obstacle collisions are avoided.\n- **Beyond 5 Turns**: After turn 88, the snake should navigate open spaces (e.g., left or top edges) to stay alive and seek new food spawns. The grid has space near (0,2) to (3,7), but internal obstacles and body must be monitored.\n\nThis plan secures +1 score by eating (4,4) and focuses on survival for future opportunities.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn 84: L (left)} \\\\ \\text{Turn 85: L (left)} \\\\ \\text{Turn 86: U (up)} \\\\ \\text{Turn 87: L (left)} \\\\ \\text{Turn 88: U (up)} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 85, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7, and an internal obstacle at (4,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders, meaning I can't go to x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7. Also, (4,6) is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: The head is at (5,4), and the body segments follow. The list is: [(5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3)]. That's 19 segments. Let me count: positions from index 0 to 18, so 19 cells. Yes.\n\nHead direction is L, which is left. So the snake is moving left.\n\nFood positions with value and life span:\n\n- (2,5) with value 1, life span 2\n\n- (1,1) with value 1, life span 4\n\n- (4,4) with value 1, life span 7\n\n- (1,4) with value 1, life span 10\n\nAll food has value 1, meaning positive food, since value is +1. No negative food here.\n\nLife span: for (2,5), it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn. Since it's turn 85, life span 2 means it will be gone by turn 86? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 85, life span 2, it will disappear after turn 86 if not eaten. Let's clarify: \"disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear at the end of turn t + L - 1? Let's think.\n\nSuppose at turn t, food has life span N. After turn t, countdown becomes N-1. If countdown reaches 0, it disappears. So for (2,5) at turn 85, life span 2, meaning after this turn (turn 85), life span becomes 1. After turn 86, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 85 or 86.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) life span 4: after turn 85, 3; turn 86, 2; turn 87, 1; turn 88, 0 and disappears. So can be eaten from turn 85 to 88.\n\n(4,4) life span 7: after turn 85, 6; gone after turn 91.\n\n(1,4) life span 10: after turn 85, 9; gone after turn 94.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns. But the answer format says to output actions starting from turn t1, which is 85, and for several turns. I should think about the sequence.\n\nFirst, where can the snake move? Head is at (5,4), direction L, so last move was left. Since no instant reverse, I cannot move right (opposite to left) on the next turn. So possible moves: Up, Down, Left. Left is the current direction, so it's allowed, but I have to check if it's safe.\n\nLet me sketch the grid. I'll make a small grid representation.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls: all border cells, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also, internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: let's list them to understand the shape.\n\nHead: (5,4)\n\nThen: (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3)\n\n(4,3) is the tail? Positions: index 0: head (5,4), index 1: (6,4), index 2: (6,3), index 3: (6,2), index 4: (6,1), index 5: (5,1), index 6: (4,1), index 7: (3,1), index 8: (2,1), index 9: (2,2), index 10: (2,3), index 11: (2,4), index 12: (3,4), index 13: (3,3), index 14: (3,2), index 15: (4,2), index 16: (5,2), index 17: (5,3), index 18: (4,3)\n\nSo tail is (4,3).\n\nNow, let's plot this on a grid. I'll use a text grid.\n\nY from 7 to 0, X from 0 to 7. But y=0 is bottom, y=7 top? In coordinates, (x,y), usually x horizontal, y vertical. But in grid terms, row and column.\n\nAssume (0,0) bottom left, (7,7) top right, but since walls at borders, we can't go there.\n\nFor simplicity, I'll think of the playable area as x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except where obstacles.\n\nWalls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable cells are x=1 to 6, y=1 to6, except (4,6) is obstacle, so not playable.\n\n(4,6) is at x=4, y=6, which should be playable but it's an obstacle, so blocked.\n\nSo grid:\n\nRow y=7: all wall except not, y=7 is wall, so no cells.\n\nPlayable rows y=1 to y=6.\n\nSimilarly x=1 to x=6.\n\nBut (4,6) is blocked.\n\nNow snake positions:\n\nLet's list all occupied cells by snake:\n\nFrom above: (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3)\n\nNow, food at:\n\n(2,5) - value 1, life 2\n\n(1,1) - value 1, life 4\n\n(4,4) - value 1, life 7\n\n(1,4) - value 1, life 10\n\n(1,1) is food, but snake has body at (2,1), (3,1), etc., but (1,1) is a cell, might be free or not.\n\nIs (1,1) occupied? Snake positions include (2,1), but not (1,1). Let's check all snake positions: from list, (2,1) is there, but (1,1) is not in snake positions, so it should be free except for food.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4) is not in snake positions, (2,5) not, (4,4) not.\n\n(4,4) is food, but snake has (5,4), (6,4), etc., but (4,4) is not listed, so free.\n\nNow, at turn 85, head at (5,4), moving left, so last direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U (up to (5,5)), D (down to (5,3)), L (left to (4,4)), or R (right to (6,4)), but R is opposite to current direction L, so cannot move right because of no instant reverse. So only U, D, L.\n\nNow, check each move for immediate safety:\n\n- Move U to (5,5): is this safe? Check if wall or body collision.\n\n(5,5): x=5, y=5. Walls: x=5 between 1-6, y=5 between 1-6, not border, and (4,6) is at (4,6), not (5,5), so no wall. Snake body: is (5,5) occupied? Snake positions: look at list, (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), etc., no (5,5), so free. So safe to move.\n\n- Move D to (5,3): (5,3) is in snake positions? Positions: (5,3) is at index 17, which is part of body. But when we move, the snake moves, so the tail moves away, except for the head.\n\nCollision: head touches any body segment except the tail, because tail will move.\n\nStandard snake rules: if head moves to a cell occupied by body, it collides, unless it's the tail and the tail moves away at the same time.\n\nIn this case, for move D to (5,3): (5,3) is currently occupied by the body at index 17: (5,3). But index 17 is not the tail; tail is (4,3) at index 18.\n\nThe body segments are fixed until move. When head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves away, so if head moves to a cell that was occupied by the tail, it might be ok, but only if that cell is free after move.\n\nLet's clarify the movement:\n\nAt turn start, snake has positions S = [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nWhen you move, new head position based on direction, then the tail is removed, so the new body is [new_head, H, B1, B2, ..., second_last], so the tail cell is vacated.\n\nTherefore, if the head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by the tail, it is safe because the tail will move away, so that cell becomes free before head occupies it? No.\n\nWhen head moves to a cell:\n\n- If that cell is currently occupied by a body part that is not the tail, collision, because after move, that body part is still there (except for the tail).\n\n- If that cell is currently occupied by the tail, no collision because when head moves there, tail moves away, so the cell is free for head.\n\nIn this case, for move to (5,3): (5,3) is currently occupied by the body segment at index 17. What is the index? Head is index 0: (5,4), index 1: (6,4), index 2: (6,3), index 3: (6,2), index 4: (6,1), index 5: (5,1), index 6: (4,1), index 7: (3,1), index 8: (2,1), index 9: (2,2), index 10: (2,3), index 11: (2,4), index 12: (3,4), index 13: (3,3), index 14: (3,2), index 15: (4,2), index 16: (5,2), index 17: (5,3), index 18: (4,3) tail.\n\nSo (5,3) is index 17, which is not the tail; tail is index 18 (4,3). Index 17 is the second last segment.\n\nIf head moves to (5,3), which is currently occupied by index 17, which is not the tail. After move, the new head would be at (5,3), but index 17 is still there until the tail moves, but when we add new head and remove tail, the cell that was tail is freed, but index 17 is not tail.\n\nSpecifically, after moving down to (5,3):\n\n- New head: (5,3)\n\n- Then the body becomes: new head (5,3), then previous head (5,4), then index 1 (6,4), ..., up to index 17 (5,3)? Index 17 was (5,3), but now new head is at (5,3), and the segment that was at (5,3) becomes part of body after.\n\nThe new snake positions: new head at (5,3), then the previous positions from index 0 to 17, but we remove the last one, which is index 18 (4,3).\n\nSo new positions: [ (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3) ] but (5,3) is now both the new head and the last body segment? Index: new head (5,3), then (5,4) index 0 old, then (6,4) index 1, ..., up to (5,2) index 16 old, which is now index 17 new, and (5,3) index 17 old is now not included because we stop before tail? Let's think.\n\nOld positions: indices 0 to 18, 19 segments.\n\nAfter move: new head at (5,3), then the first 18 segments of old body, but since we add new head, the list becomes [new_head] + old_body[0] to old_body[17], but old_body[0] is the old head, etc.\n\nStandard: new_body = [new_head_position] + old_body[:-1]\n\nold_body is the list without the tail for this purpose? old_snake_positions is full list.\n\nBetter: let S be the list of positions.\n\nAfter move in direction D, new_head = move(S[0], D)\n\nThen new_snake = [new_head] + S[:-1]  # S[:-1] is all except the last element (tail)\n\nS[:-1] has the same positions as before, but shifted.\n\nIn this case, S[0] is head (5,4), S[1] to S[17] are body, S[18] is tail (4,3).\n\nAfter move down to (5,3):\n\nnew_head = (5,3)\n\nnew_snake = [ (5,3) ] + S[0:18]  # S[0] to S[17], which are 18 elements, but S[0] is (5,4), S[1] (6,4), ..., S[17] (5,3)\n\nS[17] is (5,3), which is the position we are moving to.\n\nSo new_snake = [ (5,3) ] + [ (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3) ]\n\nNow, the new head is at (5,3), and the last element of new_snake is (5,3), which is the same as head? That means the head is at (5,3) and there is a body segment at (5,3) as well? No, in the list, position 0 is head, position 1 is first body, etc.\n\nIn new_snake, index 0: (5,3) head, index 1: (5,4), which was old head, index 2: (6,4), ..., index 18: (5,3), which is the old S[17], but (5,3) is now at both index 0 and index 18.\n\nBut index 18 is the tail, and it's the same position as head, so collision.\n\nSpecifically, when the head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by a body part, it causes collision unless that body part is the tail and it moves away.\n\nHere, (5,3) is currently occupied by S[17], which is not the tail; tail is S[18] at (4,3).\n\nAfter move, new head at (5,3), and the body at index 18 is also at (5,3), so head and body segment at same position, collision.\n\nTherefore, moving to (5,3) is not safe; it would cause the head to collide with the body segment that was there.\n\nSimilarly, in general, if the target cell is occupied by any body segment except the tail, it's a collision.\n\nIf occupied by tail, it might be ok if tail moves.\n\nIn this case, for (5,3), it's occupied by a non-tail body segment, so unsafe.\n\nNow, move L to (4,4): (4,4) is food position, but is it occupied? Snake positions: no (4,4) in list, so free. Food is there, but we can move to it to eat. So safe.\n\nMove U to (5,5): (5,5) is not in snake positions, not wall, so safe.\n\nMove D to (5,3) is unsafe, as above.\n\nAlso, move R to (6,4) is impossible because no instant reverse.\n\nSo possible actions at turn 85: U, L, or D but D is unsafe, so only U and L.\n\nD is to (5,3), which is occupied, unsafe.\n\nSo only U and L are safe immediate moves.\n\nNow, U to (5,5) or L to (4,4).\n\n(4,4) has food with value +1, life span 7, so eating it would increase length by 1.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nAlso, there is a risk: Tail Reward Danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nFirst, let's see current tail position: (4,3)\n\nHead is at (5,4), adjacent cells: up (5,5), down (5,3), left (4,4), right (6,4) but right not possible.\n\nTail is at (4,3), which is down-left from head? (5,4) to (4,3) is not adjacent; adjacent means sharing a side, so same row or column, differ by 1.\n\n(5,4) and (4,3): x differs by 1, y differs by 1, so diagonal, not adjacent. Adjacent cells are (5,5), (5,3), (4,4), (6,4).\n\n(6,4) is occupied by body, as we saw.\n\nTail at (4,3), which is not adjacent to head (5,4). For example, (4,4) is adjacent to head, but tail is at (4,3), not at (4,4).\n\nSo no immediate tail reward danger.\n\nNow, if I move L to (4,4), I eat the food there, since (4,4) has food. Value +1, so snake grows, length increases by 1, so tail doesn't move; new head at (4,4), and body includes old head and all, tail stays, so new positions: [ (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), ..., (4,3) ] but since we ate food, we don't remove the tail, so new snake is [new_head] + S, so length increases by 1.\n\nWhen you eat food, you don't remove the tail; you add the new head and keep the tail.\n\nSo for eating at (4,4):\n\nnew_head = (4,4)\n\nnew_snake = [ (4,4) ] + S  # S is old snake, so length 20 now.\n\nThen the food is consumed.\n\nIf not eating, move to empty cell, new_snake = [new_head] + S[:-1], tail removed.\n\nBack to choices.\n\nAt turn 85, I can move U or L.\n\nIf I move L, I eat the food at (4,4), grow immediately.\n\nBut is that good? I need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, there is food at (2,5) with short life, only 2 turns, so it will disappear after turn 86. I might want to eat it if possible.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) life 4, etc.\n\nNow, let's see the grid layout to plan.\n\nI should consider the available space.\n\nFirst, the snake is long, 19 segments, in a 6x6 playable area minus obstacle, so total playable cells: x=1-6, y=1-6, that's 36 cells, minus (4,6) obstacle, so 35 cells. Snake occupies 19, so 16 free cells, including food positions.\n\nFood at (2,5), (1,1), (4,4), (1,4)\n\n(4,4) is one of them.\n\nAlso, walls and borders.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I need to eat positive food while avoiding risks.\n\nBut all food here is positive.\n\nNow, life spans: (2,5) will disappear soon, so I might prioritize it if I can reach it safely.\n\nCurrent head at (5,4), (2,5) is at (2,5), which is left and up.\n\nFrom (5,4) to (2,5): I need to go left and up.\n\nBut with obstacles.\n\nLet's see path.\n\nFirst, if I move L to (4,4), I eat that food, but then I'm at (4,4), and (2,5) is at (2,5), which is left and up from there.\n\nFrom (4,4), I can go left to (3,4), but (3,4) is currently occupied by snake? Snake positions: (3,4) is index 12, which is body.\n\nBut after moving, if I move L to (4,4) and eat, new head at (4,4), body includes (5,4), (6,4), etc., and (3,4) is still there, but when I move from (4,4), if I go left to (3,4), (3,4) is occupied by old body.\n\nSimilarly, if I go up from (4,4) to (4,5), (4,5) might be free.\n\n(4,5): not in snake positions, not wall, so free.\n\nOr down to (4,3), but (4,3) is current tail, but if I ate food, tail doesn't move, so (4,3) is occupied.\n\nIf I move to (4,4) and eat, tail is still at (4,3), so (4,3) is occupied.\n\nSo from (4,4), possible moves: U to (4,5), D to (4,3) but occupied, L to (3,4) occupied, R to (5,4) occupied, so only possible move is U to (4,5).\n\nIs that right?\n\nAfter eating at (4,4), new snake head at (4,4), body: old head (5,4), then (6,4), ..., down to tail (4,3).\n\nSo cells around (4,4): up (4,5) - free, down (4,3) - occupied by tail, left (3,4) - occupied by body (index 12 or something), right (5,4) - occupied by first body segment.\n\nSo indeed, only possible move from (4,4) is up to (4,5).\n\nThen from (4,5), I can move, etc.\n\nBut if I go to (4,4) at turn 85, I must go to (4,5) at turn 86.\n\nThen from (4,5), I can go U to (4,6), but (4,6) is obstacle, wall, so cannot.\n\nD to (4,4) but occupied, L to (3,5), or R to (5,5).\n\n(3,5) and (5,5) might be free.\n\n(3,5): not in current snake positions, not wall, so free.\n\nSimilarly (5,5) free.\n\nSo from (4,5), I can go L to (3,5) or R to (5,5), not U or D.\n\nD is to (4,4), occupied.\n\nU to (4,6) wall.\n\nSo only L or R.\n\nNow, if I go this way, I might not reach (2,5) easily, since (2,5) is at (2,5), and I'm at (4,5), then to (3,5) or (5,5), then need to go left and down or something.\n\n(2,5) is at y=5, x=2.\n\nFrom (4,5) to (2,5): I can go left to (3,5), then to (2,5) if possible.\n\n(2,5) is free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\nBut at that time, snake might be there or not.\n\nBut life span of (2,5) is short, only 2 turns, so at turn 85, if I don't eat it, it disappears after turn 86.\n\nAt turn 85, I can choose to go towards it directly.\n\nInstead of moving L to (4,4), I could move U to (5,5) at turn 85.\n\nThen from (5,5), I can go to (5,6) or (4,5) or (6,5) or (5,4), but (5,4) is body, (6,5) might be free.\n\n(5,6): y=6, x=5, not wall, but (4,6) is obstacle, (5,6) is different, so (5,6) is playable? Walls only at borders and (4,6), so (5,6) should be free.\n\ny=6 is not border; borders are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable.\n\nSimilarly x=6 playable.\n\n(4,6) is internal obstacle, so only that cell blocked.\n\nSo (5,6) is free.\n\nSimilarly (6,5) free.\n\n(5,4) occupied.\n\n(4,5) free.\n\nSo from (5,5), moves: U to (5,6), D to (5,4) occupied, L to (4,5), R to (6,5).\n\nAll except D possible? D to (5,4) occupied, so U, L, R possible.\n\nNow, to reach (2,5), from (5,5), I can go L to (4,5), then to (3,5), then to (2,5).\n\nFrom current position, if I go U to (5,5), then on turn 86 I can go L to (4,5), then turn 87 to (3,5), then turn 88 to (2,5)? But (2,5) life span: at turn 85, life 2, so after turn 85, life 1, after turn 86, life 0, disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 85 or 86.\n\nTurn 85: if I move directly, but from (5,4), I can't reach (2,5) in one move; it's two cells away, min two moves.\n\nFrom (5,4) to (2,5): need to go left and up, but not adjacent, so at least two moves.\n\nFor example, move to (4,4) then to (3,4) or (4,5), but (3,4) might be occupied.\n\nIf I move to (4,4) at turn 85, I eat that food, then at turn 86 I must go to (4,5) as we saw, then at turn 87 I can go to (3,5), but (2,5) is gone by then.\n\nSimilarly, if I go U to (5,5) at turn 85, then at turn 86 I can go L to (4,5), but (2,5) is at (2,5), which is not reachable from (4,5) in one move; (4,5) to (2,5) is not adjacent, need to go to (3,5) first, which would be turn 87, but after turn 86, (2,5) disappears, so on turn 87 it's gone.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to eat (2,5) because it requires at least two moves from current position, but after turn 86 it disappears, so only possible on turn 85 or 86.\n\nOn turn 85, from (5,4), I can only move to (5,5) or (4,4), neither is (2,5).\n\nOn turn 86, if I am at (5,5), I can move to (4,5), (5,6), or (6,5), none is (2,5).\n\nIf I am at (4,4) on turn 86, I move to (4,5), still not (2,5).\n\nThen on turn 87, from wherever, (2,5) is gone.\n\nSo indeed, (2,5) cannot be eaten; it will disappear uneaten. So I should ignore it.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) has life span 4, so can be eaten until turn 88.\n\n(4,4) has long life.\n\n(1,4) has long life.\n\nNow, back to choices at turn 85.\n\nOption 1: Move L to (4,4), eat food, grow to length 20. Then at turn 86, must move U to (4,5). Then at turn 87, from (4,5), I can move L to (3,5) or R to (5,5).\n\nIf I go to (3,5), then from there, I can go to (3,6), (2,5), (3,4), or (4,5) but (4,5) might be occupied.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (5,5), similar.\n\nBut (2,5) will be gone, so not relevant.\n\nNow, there is food at (1,4) and (1,1).\n\n(1,4) is at (1,4), which is currently occupied? Snake has (2,4) at index 11, but (1,4) not occupied, so free with food.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) with food.\n\nNow, the snake body is mostly on the left and bottom, so the upper right might be more open.\n\nAfter moving to (4,5), I can explore.\n\nBut I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger.\n\nCurrent tail is at (4,3).\n\nIf I move to (4,4) and eat, tail stays at (4,3), so head at (4,4), tail at (4,3), which are adjacent now? (4,4) and (4,3) share y, x same, y differ by 1, so yes, adjacent vertically.\n\nAnd (4,3) has food? (4,3) is the tail position, but is there food there? Food positions: (2,5), (1,1), (4,4), (1,4). No food at (4,3), so no issue.\n\nBut if I were to eat food at tail, but here no food at tail.\n\nNow, after moving to (4,5) at turn 86, from (4,5), I can move to (3,5) or (5,5).\n\nSay I move to (3,5) at turn 87.\n\nThen from (3,5), I can move U to (3,6), D to (3,4), L to (2,5), R to (4,5).\n\nBut (3,6): y=6, x=3, not wall, free? (4,6) is obstacle, but (3,6) is different, so free.\n\n(3,4): currently occupied by snake, but after moves, it might be free.\n\nAt turn 87, snake positions depend on previous moves.\n\nAssume at turn 85: move L to (4,4), eat, new head (4,4), body: [ (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3) ] wait, since we ate, we add new head and keep tail, so positions: new head (4,4), then old head (5,4), then old body S[1] to S[18], S[1] is (6,4), ..., S[18] is (4,3), so 20 positions.\n\nThen at turn 86, move U to (4,5), new head (4,5), then new body: [ (4,5) ] + old_snake[:-1], but since we didn't eat, we remove tail.\n\nAt turn 86, moving to (4,5), is there food? (4,5) has no food, so no eat, so new head (4,5), then body: [ (4,5) ] + old_snake[:-1], old_snake is the one after turn 85, which has 20 segments, so old_snake[:-1] is first 19, so new snake: [ (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3) ] and tail removed, so (4,3) is gone, but we have (5,3) at the end.\n\nNew positions: head (4,5), then (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3) — 20 segments? [new_head] + old_snake[:-1], old_snake had 20, so old_snake[:-1] has 19, so new snake has 20 segments? No.\n\nAt turn 85 after eating, length 20.\n\nAt turn 86, moving to empty cell (4,5), no food, so we do not grow, so new head at (4,5), and we remove the tail, so new body: [ (4,5) ] + old_body[:-1], where old_body is the 20-segment snake.\n\nOld snake: let's call it S85: positions P0 to P19, with P0=(4,4), P1=(5,4), P2=(6,4), P3=(6,3), P4=(6,2), P5=(6,1), P6=(5,1), P7=(4,1), P8=(3,1), P9=(2,1), P10=(2,2), P11=(2,3), P12=(2,4), P13=(3,4), P14=(3,3), P15=(3,2), P16=(4,2), P17=(5,2), P18=(5,3), P19=(4,3) tail.\n\nAfter move to (4,5) no eat, new head (4,5), new snake = [ (4,5) ] + S85[:-1] = [ (4,5) ] + [ (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3) ] so 20 segments, but the last is (5,3), and (4,3) is removed.\n\nNow at turn 87, from (4,5), I can move to (3,5) or (5,5).\n\nSay I move L to (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is free, no food, so new head (3,5), new snake = [ (3,5) ] + previous[:-1], previous has 20 segments, remove tail, so 20 segments again? Previous snake S86: [ (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), ..., (5,3) ] 20 segments.\n\nNew head (3,5), no eat, so new snake [ (3,5) ] + S86[:-1] = [ (3,5) ] + [ (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) ] and tail (5,3) removed.\n\nSo now head at (3,5), and so on.\n\nBut this is getting messy for planning.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the other option at turn 85: move U to (5,5).\n\nAt turn 85, move U to (5,5), no food there, so new head (5,5), new snake [ (5,5) ] + old_snake[:-1], old_snake had 19 segments, remove tail, so 19 segments.\n\nOld snake S: [ (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3) ]\n\nNew head (5,5), no eat, so new snake [ (5,5) ] + S[:-1] = [ (5,5) ] + [ (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3) ] so 19 segments, tail is (5,3).\n\nThen at turn 86, from (5,5), I can move U to (5,6), L to (4,5), or R to (6,5).\n\nSay I move L to (4,5), no food, so new head (4,5), new snake [ (4,5) ] + previous[:-1], etc.\n\nTo reach food, for example, (1,4) at (1,4), or (1,1).\n\n(1,4) is closer.\n\nFrom current head (5,4), (1,4) is at (1,4), which is left, same y.\n\nBut there are body segments in between, like (2,4), (3,4), etc.\n\nSo I need to go around.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) at (1,1).\n\nNow, the area around (1,4) and (1,1) might be accessible.\n\nAlso, there is food at (1,1) and (1,4), both on left.\n\nBut the snake is blocking the path directly left.\n\nFor example, from (5,4), if I move U to (5,5), then I can go left to (4,5), then to (3,5), etc., avoiding the body.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can go down to (3,4), but (3,4) is body, but after moves, it might be free later.\n\nSince the snake is moving, cells become free as tail moves.\n\nFor example, current tail is at (4,3). As the snake moves, tail moves, so cells are freed.\n\nTo eat (1,4), I need to reach it when it's available.\n\nLife span 10, so plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly for (1,1), life span 4, so by turn 88.\n\nAt turn 88, it can be eaten.\n\nNow, from current position, if I move U to (5,5) at turn 85, then to (4,5) at turn 86, then to (3,5) at turn 87, then at turn 88, from (3,5), I can move to (2,5), but (2,5) will be gone, or to (3,4), or (3,6), or (4,5).\n\n(3,4) might be occupied or not.\n\nAt turn 88, depending on positions.\n\nBut (1,1) is at (1,1), which is not directly accessible.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move to (2,5) if available, but not, or to (3,4) if free, or down to (3,4), etc.\n\n(3,4) is currently body, but by turn 88, it might be free if the snake has moved.\n\nCurrent body at (3,4) is index 12, which is not near tail, so it will take many moves to free.\n\nLet's see the snake length and how it moves.\n\nThe tail is at (4,3), and the head is at (5,4), so the path from head to tail is long, 19 segments.\n\nWhen the snake moves without eating, the tail moves, freeing cells.\n\nFor example, if I move up to (5,5), then the tail (4,3) is removed, new tail is (5,3), etc.\n\nBut to free (3,4), it is at position index 12, so it will take about 7 moves for that cell to be freed, since the tail is far.\n\nIndex from head: head 0, then 1,2,3,... tail 18.\n\nIndex 12 is (3,4), so when the snake moves, each move the tail index increases or something.\n\nAfter k moves without eating, the first k body segments from the tail end are removed, so cells are freed in order from tail forward.\n\nCurrent tail at (4,3), then when we move, new tail is the previous segment.\n\nAfter one move, tail becomes (5,3) or something.\n\nLet's not get bogged down.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid eating the food at (4,4) now because it might put me in a position where I have fewer options.\n\nIf I eat at (4,4), then at (4,4) I can only move up, then at (4,5) I can only move left or right, but not down or up, so I might be constrained.\n\nWhereas if I move U to (5,5), I have more choices: I can go to (5,6), (4,5), or (6,5), all open.\n\nFrom there, I can then go towards the food at (1,4) or (1,1).\n\nFor example, from (5,5), move L to (4,5) at turn 86, then to (3,5) at turn 87, then from (3,5), I can move to (2,5) but gone, or to (3,4) if free, but at that time, (3,4) might still be occupied.\n\nAt turn 87, if I'm at (3,5), the cell (3,4) might be part of body.\n\nBut I can move to (2,5) if it were there, or to (3,6), or to (4,5) occupied.\n\nBut (2,5) gone.\n\nThen at turn 88, from (3,5), I can move D to (3,4) if free, or to other places.\n\n(3,4) could be free by then.\n\nLet's estimate when (3,4) is freed.\n\nCurrent position: (3,4) is occupied by index 12.\n\nThe tail is index 18 at (4,3).\n\nWhen the snake moves, each move without eating, the tail is removed, so the index of the tail decreases.\n\nAfter one move, tail is at index 17 position, etc.\n\nThe cell (3,4) is at fixed position, but the segment there will move away.\n\nThe segment at (3,4) will move when the snake moves, but the cell (3,4) will be occupied until that segment is the tail and we move away.\n\nThe segment that is currently at (3,4) is the 12th segment from head.\n\nIt will become the tail after 7 moves, since there are 6 segments after it (indices 13 to 18), so after 7 moves, it will be the tail, and on the 8th move, it will be removed.\n\nLet k be the number of moves without eating.\n\nAfter k moves, the tail is the segment that was at position head - k or something.\n\nInitial: head at index 0, tail at index 18.\n\nAfter one move no eat, new tail is index 17 of initial.\n\nAfter two moves, new tail index 16, and so on.\n\nThe cell that was at index i will be freed when it becomes the tail and we move away, so after (18 - i) moves, it becomes the tail, and on the next move, it is removed.\n\nFor cell at (3,4), currently index 12, so 18 - 12 = 6 moves to become tail, then on the 7th move, it is removed.\n\nSo after 7 moves without eating, the cell (3,4) is freed.\n\nSimilarly for other cells.\n\nFor (1,1), it is at (1,1), currently occupied by index 8: (2,1)? Index 8 is (2,1), not (1,1).\n\n(1,1) is free with food.\n\nTo reach (1,1), I need to go to (1,1).\n\nFrom current position, possible path: for example, move U to (5,5), then L to (4,5), then L to (3,5), then D to (3,4) but occupied, or to (2,5) gone, or to (3,6).\n\nThen from (3,5), if I go to (3,6) at turn 88, then from (3,6), I can move to (3,7) but y=7 wall, or (2,6), or (4,6) obstacle, or (3,5) occupied.\n\n(2,6) might be free.\n\nBut (1,1) is far.\n\nI could go down to the left area.\n\nAnother idea: since there is food at (1,4), which is closer, I can aim for that first.\n\n(1,4) at (1,4), life span 10.\n\nFrom (5,4), move U to (5,5), then to (4,5), then to (3,5), then to (2,5) but gone, or to (3,4) when free.\n\nBut (3,4) will be free after 7 moves.\n\nTurn 85: move U to (5,5)\n\nTurn 86: move L to (4,5)\n\nTurn 87: move L to (3,5)\n\nTurn 88: from (3,5), I can move D to (3,4) if free, but at turn 88, how many moves? From turn 85 to 88, 3 moves, but we need 7 moves to free (3,4), so not free yet.\n\nMove to (2,5) but gone, or to (3,6).\n\nSay move to (3,6) at turn 88.\n\nThen from (3,6), move to (2,6) or (3,5) occupied, etc.\n\nTo reach (1,4), from (3,6), I can move to (2,6), then to (1,6), then to (1,5), then to (1,4).\n\nBut (1,6) is playable, x=1,y=6 not wall.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5), (1,4).\n\nBut it will take several turns.\n\nAt turn 88, (1,1) life span: at turn 85, life 4, so after turn 85, 3; turn 86,2; turn 87,1; turn 88,0, so at turn 88, it disappears, so cannot be eaten after turn 87.\n\nTurn 87 is the last chance to eat (1,1).\n\nAt turn 87, if I am at (3,5), I can move to (2,5) but gone, or (3,4) occupied, or (3,6), or (4,5) occupied, none of which is (1,1), so I cannot reach (1,1) by turn 87 from here.\n\nSimilarly, if I had moved directly left, but I can't because of body.\n\nSo it might be impossible to eat (1,1) because of the snake body blocking the path, and not enough time to go around.\n\nLet's check the distance.\n\nFrom current head (5,4) to (1,1): delta x=4, delta y=3, so Manhattan distance 7.\n\nBut with body in the way, it might take more moves.\n\nMinimum 7 moves, but at turn 85, (1,1) can be eaten until turn 88, so 4 turns: 85,86,87,88.\n\nOn turn 88, it can be eaten, but after turn 88 it disappears.\n\nSo I have turns 85 to 88 to eat it.\n\nBut from (5,4), in 4 moves, I can reach (1,1) only if direct path, but it's blocked.\n\nFor example, path: from (5,4) to (4,4) but (4,4) has food, but if I eat, I grow, which might not help.\n\nOr to (5,3) but occupied.\n\nSo no direct path.\n\nGo up then left: to (5,5), then (4,5), then (3,5), then (2,5) but (2,5) gone, then (2,4) or something.\n\n(2,4) is occupied by snake.\n\nAt turn 87, from (3,5), I can move to (2,5) gone, or to (3,4) occupied, etc.\n\nNo way to (1,1) in 3 moves from (3,5).\n\nFrom (5,4), if I move D to (5,3) but unsafe, or other.\n\nSo probably, (1,1) cannot be eaten either, similar to (2,5).\n\nSo I should focus on the remaining food: (4,4) and (1,4), both with long life.\n\n(4,4) can be eaten now, or later.\n\n(1,4) at (1,4), life 10.\n\nNow, back to turn 85 choice.\n\nIf I move L to (4,4), I eat it now, but then I'm at (4,4) with only one move possible, to (4,5), then from there I have choices.\n\nIf I move U to (5,5), I don't eat now, but I have more flexibility.\n\nAlso, by not eating, I keep the snake shorter, which might be better for maneuvering.\n\nCurrent length 19, playable cells 35, occupied 19, free 16.\n\nIf I eat at (4,4), length 20, free cells 15, so more crowded.\n\nIf I don't eat, length 19, I can move to open area.\n\nThen later eat (1,4) or others.\n\nBut there are only two food left, (4,4) and (1,4), since (2,5) and (1,1) are not reachable in time.\n\n(4,4) is at (4,4), which I can eat now or later.\n\nIf I don't eat it now, it might be eaten later, but I need to go there.\n\nBut if I go to (5,5), then I might not go back to (4,4) soon.\n\nBut (4,4) has life 7, so by turn 91.\n\nPlenty of time.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4) life 10.\n\nSo at turn 85, I think it's better to move U to (5,5) to go to the open area, then plan to eat (1,4) later.\n\nMoreover, there might be new food spawning, but the problem doesn't say, so I think only existing food.\n\nThe state only has these food, so no new food.\n\nSo only these to eat.\n\nTo maximize score, I should eat both.\n\nFirst, let's go to (1,4).\n\nFrom current position, move U to (5,5) at turn 85.\n\nThen at turn 86, from (5,5), I can move L to (4,5) or U to (5,6) or R to (6,5).\n\nTo go towards (1,4), moving left is better, so move L to (4,5).\n\nThen at turn 87, from (4,5), move L to (3,5).\n\nThen at turn 88, from (3,5), move to (3,6) or (2,5) gone, or (3,4) but occupied, so move U to (3,6).\n\nThen at turn 89, from (3,6), move L to (2,6).\n\nThen at turn 90, from (2,6), move L to (1,6).\n\nThen at turn 91, from (1,6), move D to (1,5).\n\nThen at turn 92, from (1,5), move D to (1,4), eat food.\n\nBut at turn 92, (1,4) life span: at turn 85, life 10, after turn 85:9, 86:8, 87:7, 88:6, 89:5, 90:4, 91:3, 92:2, so still available.\n\nYes.\n\nBut during this, (4,4) might expire at turn 91? Life span 7 at turn 85, after 85:6, 86:5, 87:4, 88:3, 89:2, 90:1, 91:0, gone after turn 91, so on turn 91 it can be eaten? After turn 91, life 0, so last chance turn 91.\n\nAt turn 91, if I am at (1,6) or something, not at (4,4), so I might miss it.\n\nIf I want to eat both, I need to eat (4,4) first or soon.\n\nSo at turn 85, move L to (4,4) to eat it now.\n\nThen at turn 86, move U to (4,5).\n\nThen at turn 87, from (4,5), I can move L to (3,5) or R to (5,5).\n\nSay move L to (3,5).\n\nThen at turn 88, from (3,5), move U to (3,6).\n\nThen at turn 89, from (3,6), move L to (2,6).\n\nThen at turn 90, from (2,6), move L to (1,6).\n\nThen at turn 91, from (1,6), move D to (1,5).\n\nThen at turn 92, from (1,5), move D to (1,4), eat.\n\nAnd (4,4) is eaten at turn 85.\n\n(1,4) at turn 92, life span: at turn 85 life 10, turn 92 is 7 turns later, after turn 85:9, 86:8, 87:7, 88:6, 89:5, 90:4, 91:3, 92:2, so yes available.\n\nSo I can eat both.\n\nIf I don't eat (4,4) now, I might not get it later.\n\nSo better to eat it now.\n\nMoreover, by eating it, I grow, but I can still navigate.\n\nIn the path above, from turn 85 to 92, I can reach (1,4).\n\nBut I need to output actions for several turns, not just one.\n\nThe answer should be a sequence of actions starting from turn 85.\n\nBut I don't know how many turns to output.\n\nThe format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but it doesn't specify how many. Since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide at least 5 turns.\n\nTurn 85 to 89 or something.\n\nBut I can provide more.\n\nSince the grid is small, I can plan the path.\n\nAnother thing: when I move to (4,5) at turn 86, from (4,5), I can move to (3,5) or (5,5), both are fine, but to go left, (3,5) is better.\n\nSimilarly, later.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid risks.\n\nFor example, when I am at (1,6), moving down to (1,5), then to (1,4), but (1,4) might be safe.\n\nBut tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food.\n\nBut in this case, when I eat at (1,4), tail might not be adjacent.\n\nBut let's not worry for now.\n\nSo for turn 85, I think move L to (4,4) is good, eat food.\n\nThen turn 86: move U to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 87: from (4,5), move L to (3,5)\n\nThen turn 88: from (3,5), move U to (3,6)  (since (3,4) might be occupied, and (2,5) gone, so up)\n\nThen turn 89: from (3,6), move L to (2,6)\n\nThen turn 90: from (2,6), move L to (1,6)\n\nThen turn 91: from (1,6), move D to (1,5)\n\nThen turn 92: from (1,5), move D to (1,4) eat.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output from turn 85 onwards for a few turns.\n\nSince the format is to box the actions, I can do 5 turns: turn 85 to 89.\n\nTurn 85: L\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: L (to (3,5))\n\nBut at turn 87, from (4,5), moving to (3,5) is fine.\n\nThen turn 88: U to (3,6)\n\nTurn 89: L to (2,6)\n\nBut I can stop at turn 89.\n\nThe problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output format is for the actions to take.\n\nI think for turn 85, move L is better to get the food.\n\nIf I move U, I might not get (4,4) later.\n\nBut with life span 7, I can get it later, but it might be risky.\n\nFor example, if I move U to (5,5) at 85, then to (4,5) at 86, then to (3,5) at 87, then at turn 88, I can move to (3,4) but may not be free, or to (3,6).\n\nIf I go to (3,6), then at turn 89 to (2,6), etc., to (1,4) by turn 92, but (4,4) expires at turn 91, so on turn 91, I need to be at (4,4) to eat.\n\nBut at turn 91, if I am at (1,6) or (2,6), I can't be at (4,4).\n\nSo I would miss (4,4).\n\nTherefore, it's better to eat (4,4) now at turn 85.\n\nSo I think move L at turn 85.\n\nThen the sequence can be as above.\n\nFor the answer, I'll provide actions for turn 85 to 89 or so.\n\nBut let's confirm the moves are safe.\n\nTurn 85: move L to (4,4) - eat food, safe.\n\nTurn 86: move U to (4,5) - no food, safe, and only choice really.\n\nTurn 87: from (4,5), possible moves: U to (4,6) wall, D to (4,4) occupied, L to (3,5), R to (5,5). Both L and R are safe. I chose L to (3,5) to go towards left.\n\nTurn 88: from (3,5), possible moves: U to (3,6), D to (3,4) occupied (since not freed yet), L to (2,5) gone, R to (4,5) occupied. So only U to (3,6) is possible and safe.\n\nTurn 89: from (3,6), possible moves: U to (3,7) wall, D to (3,5) occupied, L to (2,6), R to (4,6) obstacle. So only L to (2,6) safe.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nFor output, I'll do up to turn 89.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 85: L\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: L\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nTurn 89: L\n\nIn the sequence, turn 87 is L to (3,5), turn 88 U to (3,6), turn 89 L to (2,6).\n\nYes.\n\nI think that's a plan.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I need to prioritize eating positive food while avoiding collisions and considering the time-sensitive nature of food life spans. The grid is 8x8 with walls at the borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and an internal obstacle at (4,6). The snake has 19 segments, occupying many cells in the playable area (x=1-6, y=1-6, minus (4,6)), leaving limited free space. Key food items are:\n- (2,5): Life span 2 (disappears after turn 86).\n- (1,1): Life span 4 (disappears after turn 88).\n- (4,4): Life span 7 (disappears after turn 91).\n- (1,4): Life span 10 (disappears after turn 94).\n\nGiven the short life spans of (2,5) and (1,1), and their positions relative to the snake's body, it is impossible to reach them before they expire due to body blockages and distance. Therefore, I focus on eating (4,4) and (1,4), which have longer life spans. Eating (4,4) immediately at turn 85 is optimal because:\n- It provides an immediate score increase (+1) and grows the snake.\n- Delaying risks missing it due to its life span (expires after turn 91) and potential future blockages.\n- After eating (4,4), the snake must move up to (4,5) on turn 86, then proceed left toward (1,4) via safe paths.\n\nThe snake head starts at (5,4) with direction L (left). Possible moves at turn 85 are U (up), D (down), or L (left), but D to (5,3) is unsafe (collision with body). R (right) is invalid due to no instant reverse. Thus, only U and L are safe. Moving L eats (4,4), while U avoids eating but may miss opportunities.\n\n### Path Planning for 5+ Turns\nI plan the following sequence to eat (4,4) and navigate toward (1,4) while avoiding risks:\n- **Turn 85**: Move L to (4,4) to eat food (+1 score, length increases to 20). This is safe and starts the path.\n- **Turn 86**: From (4,4), only U to (4,5) is safe (other moves cause collisions).\n- **Turn 87**: From (4,5), move L to (3,5) to head toward the left side where (1,4) is located.\n- **Turn 88**: From (3,5), only U to (3,6) is safe (down, left, and right moves are blocked by body or walls).\n- **Turn 89**: From (3,6), move L to (2,6) to continue toward (1,4).\n- **Beyond turn 89**: The path can continue to (1,6) by turn 90, (1,5) by turn 91, and (1,4) by turn 92 to eat the food there.\n\nThis sequence eats (4,4) immediately and sets up a safe path to (1,4) within its life span. All moves avoid walls, body collisions, and instant reverses. Tail reward danger is not an issue, as the tail (initially at (4,3)) does not have food and is not adjacent to the head during critical moves.\n\n### Answer Format\nThe actions for turns 85 to 89 are:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 85: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 86: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 87: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 88: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 89: L (left)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid because the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6). There's also an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nCurrent turn is 86. Snake positions are given as a list: head is at (4,4), and the body follows. The snake has 20 segments since there are 20 positions listed. Head direction is left, meaning it's moving L (left), so from (4,4) it came from the right, I assume, since positions are head first.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (2,5) with value 1 and life span 1. So it disappears after this turn if not eaten? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 86, life span is 1, meaning after this turn, it will be gone. So it must be eaten this turn or it vanishes.\n\n- (1,1) with value 1 and life span 3. So it will disappear after 3 more turns, meaning at turn 89 it will be gone if not eaten by then.\n\n- (1,4) with value 1 and life span 9. So it will disappear after 9 more turns, by turn 95.\n\nAll food has value 1, so all are positive food, no negative food here.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nSnake head is at (4,4), moving left. So possible moves: since head direction is L, I can't move right instantly because of no instant reverse. So possible moves are U (up), D (down), L (left). But I have to consider the grid and obstacles.\n\nGrid boundaries: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. Walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so cells outside 1-6 are invalid.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), which is a wall cell, so I can't move there.\n\nNow, let's map the snake positions to understand the body.\n\nSnake positions: [(4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3)]\n\nSo head: (4,4)\n\nThen body: (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3)\n\nTail is (4,3).\n\nI should plot this to visualize.\n\nLet me sketch a grid:\n\nRows y=6 to y=1 (top to bottom), columns x=1 to x=6.\n\ny=6: but (4,6) is wall, so not accessible.\n\ny=5: empty?\n\ny=4: (4,4) head, (5,4), (6,4), (2,4), (3,4)\n\nList positions by coordinates:\n\n- (4,4) head\n\n- (5,4) body\n\n- (6,4) body\n\n- (6,3) body\n\n- (6,2) body\n\n- (6,1) body\n\n- (5,1) body\n\n- (4,1) body\n\n- (3,1) body\n\n- (2,1) body\n\n- (2,2) body\n\n- (2,3) body\n\n- (2,4) body\n\n- (3,4) body\n\n- (3,3) body\n\n- (3,2) body\n\n- (4,2) body\n\n- (5,2) body\n\n- (5,3) body\n\n- (4,3) tail\n\nNow, food at:\n\n- (2,5) value 1, life 1 – must eat this turn or gone\n\n- (1,1) value 1, life 3 – eat by turn 88? Life span 3 at turn 86, so decreases each turn: turn 86: life=3, turn 87: life=2, turn 88: life=1, turn 89: gone. So must eat by turn 88.\n\nLife span decreases every turn including current, so at turn t, life_span is remaining turns including t.\n\nFor (2,5): life_span=1 at turn 86, so after turn 86, it disappears. So only available on turn 86.\n\nFor (1,1): life_span=3 at turn 86, so available on turns 86,87,88; disappears after turn 88.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4): life_span=9, available until turn 94, disappears after turn 94? Turn 86: life=9, turn 87:8, ..., turn 94:1, turn 95 gone. So eat by turn 94.\n\nNow, head at (4,4), moving left. So from (4,4), moving left would go to (3,4).\n\nBut (3,4) is occupied by the snake body? Let's see: positions include (3,4), which is the 14th segment? Positions: index 0: (4,4), 1: (5,4), 2: (6,4), 3: (6,3), ..., 13: (2,4), 14: (3,4)? Let's list with indices:\n\n0: (4,4) head\n\n1: (5,4)\n\n2: (6,4)\n\n3: (6,3)\n\n4: (6,2)\n\n5: (6,1)\n\n6: (5,1)\n\n7: (4,1)\n\n8: (3,1)\n\n9: (2,1)\n\n10: (2,2)\n\n11: (2,3)\n\n12: (2,4)\n\n13: (3,4) ? (2,4) is 12, then 13: (3,4)? Positions: after (2,4) is (3,4), yes.\n\nIn the list: [(4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3)]\n\nSo (3,4) is position 13.\n\n(3,4) is a body segment.\n\nIf I move left to (3,4), that would be a collision because head touches body, except for the tail if it's moving away.\n\nGeneral rule: moving into a cell occupied by the body is deadly unless it's the tail and the tail moves away at the same time.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (3,4), which is occupied, but it's not the tail; tail is (4,3). So (3,4) is a body segment, so moving there would cause collision and death.\n\nTherefore, moving left to (3,4) is not possible.\n\nSimilarly, moving up: from (4,4), up would be (4,5). Is that free? Let's see what's at (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is not in snake positions, and not a wall? Walls are only at borders and (4,6). (4,5) should be free, but (4,6) is wall, but (4,5) is not wall.\n\nBorders: x=0,7 y=0,7, so (4,5) is within 1-6, and not an obstacle except (4,6) is wall, but (4,5) is different cell.\n\nInternal obstacle only (4,6), so (4,5) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, moving down: (4,3). But (4,3) is the tail? Tail is at (4,3), position 19.\n\nIf I move down to (4,3), which is the tail, since the tail will move forward, it might be safe, but I need to check the direction.\n\nThe snake is moving, so when head moves to a new cell, the tail moves away if no food eaten.\n\nIf I eat food, the tail doesn't move, so if I move to tail cell and eat food, it might cause collision because the tail doesn't move.\n\nBut in this case, (4,3) has food? No, food is at (2,5), (1,1), (1,4), not at (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is tail, no food mentioned there.\n\nSo if I move to (4,3), since no food eaten, the tail will move away, so it should be safe to move to the tail cell because the tail vacates it.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat food, the tail stays, but since no food at (4,3), moving there should be ok.\n\nNow, possible moves from (4,4) with direction L:\n\n- U (up) to (4,5)\n\n- D (down) to (4,3)\n\n- L (left) to (3,4) but (3,4) is body, not tail, so collision.\n\n- R (right) to (5,4) but (5,4) is body, position 1, and also, reverse direction is not allowed since current direction is L, moving right would be opposite, so instant reverse forbidden.\n\nTherefore, only possible moves are U to (4,5) or D to (4,3).\n\nNow, (4,3) is the tail, so moving there should be safe since tail moves.\n\n(4,5) is empty.\n\nBut there's food at (2,5) with life 1, must eat this turn.\n\n(2,5) is at x=2,y=5.\n\nFrom (4,4), how to get to (2,5) in one move? Impossible, since adjacent cells are (4,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,4), but (3,4) and (5,4) are blocked or invalid.\n\n(4,5) is up, which I can go, but (4,5) is not (2,5).\n\nTo eat (2,5) this turn, I need to be at (2,5) now, but head is at (4,4), so I can't eat it this turn directly. I need to move to a cell adjacent to it or something, but eating requires head to move onto the food cell.\n\nSo on turn 86, head is at (4,4), food at (2,5), so I can't reach it in one move. Therefore, I cannot eat (2,5) this turn; it will disappear after this turn.\n\nLife span 1 at turn 86, so after turn 86, it's gone. Since I can't be at (2,5) on turn 86, I miss this food.\n\nSimilarly, for other food.\n\nSo (2,5) is lost; I can't get it.\n\nNow, I need to decide between moving U to (4,5) or D to (4,3).\n\nAlso, think long-term.\n\nFirst, let's see the grid state.\n\nI should consider the snake's path and possible dead ends.\n\nList all occupied cells: snake positions.\n\nFrom the list:\n\n(4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3)\n\nAlso, walls: borders, so cells like (1,6), (2,6), etc., but borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, so (x,0), (x,7), (0,y), (7,y) are walls, but since playable area is 1-6, we don't go there. Internal obstacle (4,6), so (4,6) is wall.\n\nNow, free cells: I need to find where I can go.\n\nFor example, row y=5: possible x=1 to 6, but (4,6) is wall, so y=5 cells: (1,5), (2,5) has food, (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5)\n\n(2,5) has food, but will be gone after this turn.\n\n(1,5) might be free? Not listed in snake or walls.\n\nSimilarly, y=6: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) wall, (5,6), (6,6) but y=6 is border? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=6 is within 1-6? y=1 to 6, y=6 is top row, not wall unless border.\n\nBorders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So y=7 is wall, y=6 is playable, similarly x=7 wall, x=6 playable.\n\nSo y=6: cells (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) is internal wall, so not accessible, (5,6), (6,6)\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\nBut for now, from (4,4), moving U to (4,5) or D to (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is tail, so after move, if I go D to (4,3), since no food eaten, tail moves, so the new tail will be the previous segment, which is (5,3)? Let's see the positions.\n\nAfter move: head moves to (4,3), but (4,3) was tail, so it becomes the new head? No.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, and no food, the tail moves to the next position, so the cell that was tail is vacated.\n\nIn this case, if head moves to (4,3), which was tail, but since tail moves away, the head can occupy it safely.\n\nThen the new snake: head at (4,3), then the body: the previous head (4,4) becomes new segment 1, then (5,4), (6,4), etc., up to (5,3), which was the second last, but tail was (4,3), and before that was (5,3), I think.\n\nPositions: indices 0: (4,4) head, 1: (5,4), 2: (6,4), 3: (6,3), 4: (6,2), 5: (6,1), 6: (5,1), 7: (4,1), 8: (3,1), 9: (2,1), 10: (2,2), 11: (2,3), 12: (2,4), 13: (3,4), 14: (3,3), 15: (3,2), 16: (4,2), 17: (5,2), 18: (5,3), 19: (4,3) tail.\n\nIf head moves down to (4,3), and no food, then tail moves away. The tail was at (4,3), but after head moves to (4,3), the new head is at (4,3), and the tail segment is removed, so the new tail is the previous segment 18: (5,3).\n\nThe snake moves: head to new position, then each segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead.\n\nSo if head moves to (4,3), which was position 19, but position 19 is occupied by tail, but it will be vacated.\n\nNew positions: head: (4,3)\n\nThen segment 1: old head (4,4)\n\nSegment 2: old seg1 (5,4)\n\nSegment 3: old seg2 (6,4)\n\n...\nUp to segment 19: old seg18 (5,3)\n\nOld seg19 (4,3) is now head, so not part of body.\n\nThe body segments shift: the new segment 1 is the old head position (4,4), new segment 2 is old segment 1 (5,4), and so on, up to new segment 19 is old segment 18 (5,3), and the old tail (4,3) is now the new head position.\n\nSo the cell (4,3) is now head, and the tail is at (5,3), which was previously occupied, but now it's tail.\n\nAnd (5,3) was position 18, which is now tail.\n\nImportantly, the cell (4,3) was tail but is now head, and since tail moved, no collision.\n\nIf I had eaten food, tail stays, but no food here.\n\nSimilarly, if I move up to (4,5), new head at (4,5), new body: (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), ..., up to (5,3), and tail at (5,3)? Old tail (4,3) is removed, so new tail is old segment 18 (5,3).\n\nIn both cases, tail ends up at (5,3) after move.\n\nNow, back to decision.\n\nFood at (2,5) must be eaten now but can't, so ignore.\n\nOther food: (1,1) with life 3, so can eat in next 3 turns.\n\n(1,4) with life 9.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nNow, let's see the grid after possible moves.\n\nFirst, if I move down to (4,3):\n\nHead at (4,3), direction was L, but after move, direction depends on move. Head direction changes to the move direction.\n\nAfter moving, the head direction is set to the move.\n\nSo if I move D, new head direction is D.\n\nThen from (4,3), possible moves: U to (4,4), but (4,4) is now body segment? After move, positions: head (4,3), then (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3) tail.\n\n(3,3) is a body segment, (4,4) is body, etc.\n\nFrom (4,3), new head direction D (down), so moving down would be to (4,2), but (4,2) is body segment? Positions include (4,2), which is segment 16, not tail; tail is (5,3). So (4,2) is body, so moving to (4,2) would be collision.\n\nMoving up to (4,4), but (4,4) is body, segment 1, not tail, collision.\n\nMoving left to (3,3), (3,3) is body segment 14, collision.\n\nMoving right to (5,3), (5,3) is tail? (5,3) is the current tail, position 19.\n\nIf I move to (5,3), which is tail, and no food there, so tail will move away, should be safe.\n\nBut head direction is D, moving right to (5,3) is not opposite? Opposite of down is up, so right is not opposite, so allowed.\n\nPossible moves from (4,3) with direction D:\n\n- U: to (4,4) - body, collision\n\n- D: to (4,2) - body, collision\n\n- L: to (3,3) - body, collision\n\n- R: to (5,3) - tail, and since no food, tail moves, so safe.\n\nSo only possible move is R to (5,3).\n\nBut (5,3) is tail, so after moving, new head at (5,3), tail moves to previous position, which is (5,2)? Let's see.\n\nCurrent after first move: head (4,3), body: (4,4), (5,4), ..., (5,2), (5,3) tail? Positions: head (4,3), seg1 (4,4), seg2 (5,4), seg3 (6,4), seg4 (6,3), seg5 (6,2), seg6 (6,1), seg7 (5,1), seg8 (4,1), seg9 (3,1), seg10 (2,1), seg11 (2,2), seg12 (2,3), seg13 (2,4), seg14 (3,4), seg15 (3,3), seg16 (4,2), seg17 (5,2), seg18 (5,3) tail? I think I miscounted.\n\nAfter moving to (4,3) from (4,4), the positions are:\n\nNew head: (4,3)\n\nNew seg1: old head (4,4)\n\nNew seg2: old seg1 (5,4)\n\nNew seg3: old seg2 (6,4)\n\nNew seg4: old seg3 (6,3)\n\nNew seg5: old seg4 (6,2)\n\nNew seg6: old seg5 (6,1)\n\nNew seg7: old seg6 (5,1)\n\nNew seg8: old seg7 (4,1)\n\nNew seg9: old seg8 (3,1)\n\nNew seg10: old seg9 (2,1)\n\nNew seg11: old seg10 (2,2)\n\nNew seg12: old seg11 (2,3)\n\nNew seg13: old seg12 (2,4)\n\nNew seg14: old seg13 (3,4)\n\nNew seg15: old seg14 (3,3)\n\nNew seg16: old seg15 (3,2)\n\nNew seg17: old seg16 (4,2)\n\nNew seg18: old seg17 (5,2)\n\nNew seg19: old seg18 (5,3)  // tail\n\nYes, tail at (5,3)\n\nNow, from head at (4,3), direction D, move R to (5,3), which is tail.\n\nSince no food, tail moves away to (5,2)? When head moves to (5,3), the tail (5,3) is vacated as tail moves.\n\nNew positions: head at (5,3), then seg1: (4,3), seg2: (4,4), seg3: (5,4), and so on, up to seg19: (5,2), since old seg18 (5,2) becomes new tail? Old seg18 was (5,2), which was new seg18 in previous, but let's not confuse.\n\nAfter move to (5,3):\n\nNew head: (5,3)\n\nNew seg1: previous head position (4,3)\n\nNew seg2: previous seg1 (4,4)\n\nNew seg3: previous seg2 (5,4)\n\nNew seg4: previous seg3 (6,4)\n\nNew seg5: previous seg4 (6,3)\n\nNew seg6: previous seg5 (6,2)\n\nNew seg7: previous seg6 (6,1)\n\nNew seg8: previous seg7 (5,1)\n\nNew seg9: previous seg8 (4,1)\n\nNew seg10: previous seg9 (3,1)\n\nNew seg11: previous seg10 (2,1)\n\nNew seg12: previous seg11 (2,2)\n\nNew seg13: previous seg12 (2,3)\n\nNew seg14: previous seg13 (2,4)\n\nNew seg15: previous seg14 (3,4)\n\nNew seg16: previous seg15 (3,3)\n\nNew seg17: previous seg16 (3,2)\n\nNew seg18: previous seg17 (4,2)\n\nNew seg19: previous seg18 (5,2)  // new tail\n\nAnd previous tail (5,3) is now head.\n\nSo after two moves, head is at (5,3), direction R (since moved right).\n\nBut this is if I first move down to (4,3), then only can move right to (5,3).\n\nBut at turn 86, if I move down, then at turn 87, I must move right, but I need to plan multiple turns.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 86 I move up to (4,5).\n\nLet's consider the up move first.\n\nAt turn 86, move U to (4,5).\n\nNew head at (4,5), direction U (up).\n\nNew positions: head (4,5), seg1: (4,4), seg2: (5,4), seg3: (6,4), ..., up to seg19: (5,3) tail, same as before but head at (4,5) instead of (4,3).\n\nBody: (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3) tail.\n\nFrom (4,5), direction U, possible moves:\n\nU to (4,6): but (4,6) is wall, so invalid.\n\nD to (4,4): but (4,4) is body, seg1, not tail, collision.\n\nL to (3,5): is (3,5) free? Not in snake positions, not wall, so should be free.\n\nR to (5,5): similarly, free.\n\nAlso, no instant reverse, but moving down would be reverse of up, but D is to (4,4) which is body anyway, but even if free, reverse is not allowed only if it's the opposite direction immediately, but here moving D is opposite to U, so cannot move down because of no instant reverse.\n\nCurrent direction is U, so cannot move D (down) on next turn.\n\nPossible moves: U, L, R.\n\nBut U to (4,6) wall, invalid.\n\nL to (3,5) possible.\n\nR to (5,5) possible.\n\nD not allowed and also blocked.\n\nSo from (4,5), I can move L to (3,5) or R to (5,5).\n\nNow, comparing the two options at turn 86.\n\nIf I move D to (4,3), then at turn 87, I can only move R to (5,3), as we saw.\n\nThen at turn 87, after moving to (5,3), head at (5,3), direction R.\n\nFrom (5,3), possible moves:\n\nU to (5,4): but (5,4) is body segment, seg2 or something? After move to (5,3), positions: head (5,3), seg1 (4,3), seg2 (4,4), seg3 (5,4), etc.\n\n(5,4) is seg3, body, not tail.\n\nD to (5,2): (5,2) is body, seg19 or something, but in positions, (5,2) is there, not tail.\n\nL to (4,3): (4,3) is seg1, body, collision.\n\nR to (6,3): (6,3) is body? Positions include (6,3), which is seg4 or something.\n\nAfter head at (5,3), seg1 (4,3), seg2 (4,4), seg3 (5,4), seg4 (6,4), seg5 (6,3), etc.\n\n(6,3) is seg5, body.\n\nTail is at (5,2), I think.\n\nFrom above: new tail is (5,2)\n\nSo moving to (5,2) is tail, could be safe if no food.\n\nBut direction is R, moving down to (5,2) is not opposite, so allowed.\n\nPossible moves from (5,3) dir R:\n\n- U: to (5,4) - body, collision\n\n- D: to (5,2) - tail? (5,2) is tail, and no food there, so moving there should be safe, tail moves.\n\n- L: to (4,3) - body, seg1, collision\n\n- R: to (6,3) - body, seg5, collision\n\nSo only possible move is D to (5,2).\n\nThen similarly, it forces me down.\n\nBut this seems like I'm going in circles or into a corner.\n\nLet's see the area.\n\nAfter moving D at turn 86 to (4,3), then R to (5,3) at turn 87, then D to (5,2) at turn 88.\n\nAt (5,2), with direction D (since moved down).\n\nThen from (5,2), possible moves: U to (5,3) but (5,3) is now head position? After moving to (5,2), new head (5,2), seg1 (5,3), etc.\n\n(5,3) is seg1, body.\n\nD to (5,1): (5,1) is body, in positions.\n\nL to (4,2): (4,2) is body.\n\nR to (6,2): (6,2) is body.\n\nAll adjacent cells are body or wall? (5,1) is seg7 or something, body; (4,2) body; (6,2) body; (5,3) body. So all directions collision, dead end!\n\nIf I go down at turn 86, by turn 88, I am at (5,2) with no moves, death.\n\nTherefore, moving down at turn 86 is suicidal.\n\nI must not move down; I must move up to (4,5).\n\nAt turn 86, move U to (4,5).\n\nThen head at (4,5), direction U.\n\nThen at turn 87, I can move L to (3,5) or R to (5,5).\n\nNow, food to consider: (1,1) with life 3, must eat by turn 88.\n\n(1,1) is at bottom left.\n\nAlso, (1,4) with life 9.\n\nFrom (4,5), I need to go towards (1,1) or other areas.\n\nFirst, let's see the free space.\n\nThe snake is mostly on the bottom and right, but with head at (4,5), which is top-middle.\n\nFree cells: for example, (1,5), (2,5) has food but gone after this turn, so turn 87, (2,5) is gone.\n\n(3,5), (4,5) head, (5,5), (6,5)\n\nAlso y=6: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (5,6), (6,6) since (4,6) wall.\n\ny=4 and below have many snake bodies.\n\nSpecifically, (1,1) is food, but surrounded? (1,1) is a cell, adjacent cells: (1,2), (2,1), (1,0) wall, (0,1) wall.\n\n(1,2) is snake body? Positions: (2,2), (2,1), but (1,2) not listed, so free? Let's see.\n\nSnake positions include (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), etc., but not (1,1) or (1,2), etc.\n\n(1,1) is food, so not occupied by snake.\n\nAdjacent to (1,1): (1,2), (2,1)\n\n(2,1) is snake body, segment 9 or something, occupied.\n\n(1,2) might be free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4) is food, adjacent: (1,3), (1,5), (2,4), (0,4) wall.\n\n(2,4) is snake body, occupied.\n\n(1,3) and (1,5) may be free.\n\nNow, to eat (1,1), I need to move to (1,1) by turn 88.\n\nCurrent turn 86, head at (4,5) after move.\n\nTurn 87: I can move to (3,5) or (5,5)\n\nTurn 88: need to be at (1,1) or adjacent to move there.\n\n(1,1) from (4,5) is not close.\n\nShortest path: from (4,5) to (1,1) is distance |4-1| + |5-1| = 3+4=7, too far in 2 turns? Turn 87 and 88, two moves.\n\nAfter turn 86, at (4,5)\n\nTurn 87: move to say (3,5) or (5,5)\n\nThen turn 88: from there, to (1,1) impossible in one move.\n\nFor example, from (3,5) to (1,1): min moves: e.g., (3,5) to (2,5) to (1,5) to (1,4) to (1,3) to (1,2) to (1,1), 6 moves, or shorter? (3,5) to (2,4) but (2,4) may be occupied.\n\nBut from (3,5) to (1,1) directly not possible; need multiple moves.\n\nSimilarly, from (5,5) worse.\n\nSo by turn 88, I cannot reach (1,1) from here; it's too far.\n\nTurn 88 is the last chance to eat (1,1), but after turn 88 move, I think.\n\nTurn 86: current, after move head at new position.\n\nTurn 87: move, head moves.\n\nTurn 88: move, head moves to a cell.\n\nIf on turn 88, head moves to (1,1), it can be eaten.\n\nBut from (4,5) at start of turn 87, after turn 86 move.\n\nAt start of turn 87, head at (4,5).\n\nAfter moving on turn 87, head at new position.\n\nThen turn 88, move to (1,1).\n\nBut from (4,5), in one move (turn 87), I can go to (3,5), (4,6) invalid, (5,5), (4,4) invalid.\n\nFrom (3,5) or (5,5), to (1,1) in one move? No, adjacent cells only.\n\n(3,5) to (1,1): not adjacent, |dx|=2, |dy|=4.\n\nSimilarly, impossible to reach (1,1) by turn 88.\n\nTherefore, I cannot eat (1,1); it will disappear uneaten.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) is already gone.\n\nOnly food left is (1,4) with life 9, so I have time.\n\nI need to survive and eat it later.\n\nNow, back to turn 86, move U to (4,5).\n\nThen turn 87, I can move L to (3,5) or R to (5,5).\n\nNow, let's see which is better.\n\nFirst, move L to (3,5).\n\nThen head at (3,5), direction L (if moved left).\n\nThen from there, possible moves.\n\nBut I need to think about the tail and freeing space.\n\nThe snake is long, 20 segments, so it occupies many cells.\n\nEventually, the tail will move, freeing cells.\n\nBut to eat (1,4), I need to go left.\n\n(1,4) at x=1,y=4.\n\nFrom (4,5), moving to (3,5) is closer.\n\nThen from (3,5), I can move to (2,5), but (2,5) had food but gone, so now empty, or to (3,6), etc.\n\n(3,6) is y=6, free? Assuming.\n\nAlso, (1,4) can be approached from above or left, but left is wall.\n\n(1,4) adjacent: (1,3), (1,5), (2,4)\n\n(2,4) is occupied by snake, as per positions.\n\n(1,3) and (1,5) may be free.\n\n(1,5) is at top-left.\n\nNow, to plan multiple turns.\n\nSince I have to output actions for several turns, but the answer format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't specify how many, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan a sequence.\n\nBut I need to specify actions starting from turn 86.\n\nFirst, at turn 86, I must move U to (4,5) to avoid death.\n\nThen at turn 87, from (4,5), I can move L or R.\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nMake a 6x6 grid, y=6 top, y=1 bottom, x=1 left, x=6 right.\n\nWalls: (4,6) occupied, so not accessible.\n\nSnake positions at turn 86 before move: head (4,4), then body as listed.\n\nAfter move U to (4,5), head at (4,5), body: (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), tail (4,3) but after move, tail is (5,3) as before.\n\nFree cells: let's list all free cells.\n\nGrid cells:\n\ny=6: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) wall, (5,6), (6,6)\n\ny=5: (1,5), (2,5) food but gone after turn 86, so turn 87 not there, (3,5), (4,5) head after move, (5,5), (6,5)\n\ny=4: (1,4) food, (2,4) snake, (3,4) snake, (4,4) snake, (5,4) snake, (6,4) snake\n\ny=3: (1,3), (2,3) snake, (3,3) snake, (4,3) snake? After move, (4,3) is not part of snake if I moved U, but when I move U to (4,5), the tail is at (5,3), so (4,3) is free? Positions after move U: head (4,5), seg1 (4,4), seg2 (5,4), seg3 (6,4), seg4 (6,3), seg5 (6,2), seg6 (6,1), seg7 (5,1), seg8 (4,1), seg9 (3,1), seg10 (2,1), seg11 (2,2), seg12 (2,3), seg13 (2,4), seg14 (3,4), seg15 (3,3), seg16 (3,2), seg17 (4,2), seg18 (5,2), seg19 (5,3) tail.\n\nSo occupied: (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3)\n\nFree cells:\n\ny=6: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (5,6), (6,6)\n\ny=5: (1,5), (3,5), (5,5), (6,5)  // (2,5) gone, (4,5) occupied\n\ny=4: (1,4) food, (3,4) occupied, etc, only (1,4) free but has food\n\ny=3: (1,3) free? Not listed, (2,3) occ, (3,3) occ, (4,3) not listed, after move, (4,3) is not occupied, since tail at (5,3), so (4,3) free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) not occupied.\n\ny=2: (1,2) free? Not listed, (2,2) occ, (3,2) occ, (4,2) occ, (5,2) occ, (6,2) occ, so (1,2) free\n\ny=1: (1,1) food but will be gone soon, (2,1) occ, (3,1) occ, (4,1) occ, (5,1) occ, (6,1) occ, so (1,1) has food but life 3, but we can't eat it, so effectively free later.\n\nBut for now, free cells include: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (5,6), (6,6), (1,5), (3,5), (5,5), (6,5), (1,4) food, (1,3), (4,3)? (4,3) is free, (1,2), and (1,1) food temporarily.\n\n(4,3) is at x=4,y=3, which was previously tail but now free.\n\nSimilarly, other cells.\n\nNow, to eat (1,4), I can go from top or from left, but left is wall, so from (1,5) or (1,3) or (2,4) but (2,4) occupied.\n\n(2,4) is occupied, so I need to move to (1,5) or (1,3) first.\n\nFrom current head at (4,5), at turn 87, I can move L to (3,5) or R to (5,5).\n\n(3,5) is closer to (1,4).\n\nFor example, move to (3,5) at turn 87.\n\nThen head at (3,5), direction L.\n\nThen from there, I can move U to (3,6), D to (3,4), L to (2,5), or R to (4,5) but (4,5) is body now.\n\nAfter move to (3,5), new positions: head (3,5), seg1 (4,5), seg2 (4,4), etc.\n\n(4,5) is now body, so moving to (4,5) would be collision.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) is body, (2,5) is free, (3,6) free.\n\nPossible moves from (3,5) dir L:\n\nU to (3,6): free\n\nD to (3,4): body, collision ( (3,4) is seg13 or something)\n\nL to (2,5): free? (2,5) was food but gone, so empty\n\nR to (4,5): body, collision\n\nAnd no instant reverse, but moving R is not opposite to L? Opposite of left is right, so moving right is instant reverse, forbidden.\n\nCurrent direction L, so cannot move R on next turn.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L.\n\nD to (3,4) body, collision.\n\nU to (3,6) or L to (2,5).\n\nSo I can go up or left.\n\nIf I go to (2,5), then from there, I can go to (1,5) or (2,6), etc.\n\nThen towards (1,4).\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 87 I move R to (5,5), I go right, away from (1,4), which might not be good.\n\nSo better to move L to (3,5) at turn 87.\n\nThen at turn 88, from (3,5), I can move U to (3,6) or L to (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is closer to (1,4).\n\nMove to (2,5).\n\nThen head at (2,5), direction L (since moved left from (3,5)).\n\nThen from (2,5), possible moves: U to (2,6), D to (2,4), L to (1,5), R to (3,5) but (3,5) is body now.\n\nAnd no reverse: direction L, so cannot move R.\n\nD to (2,4): (2,4) is body, occupied, collision.\n\nU to (2,6): free\n\nL to (1,5): free\n\nSo moves U or L.\n\nThen I can go to (1,5) or (2,6).\n\nFrom (1,5), I can then move down to (1,4) to eat the food.\n\n(1,4) is food.\n\nIf I go to (1,5) at some point, then I can move D to (1,4).\n\nBut need to make sure it's safe.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills, but here no food on tail now.\n\nNow, let's plan the sequence.\n\nTurn 86: move U to (4,5)\n\nTurn 87: move L to (3,5)\n\nTurn 88: from (3,5), move L to (2,5)\n\nNow at (2,5), direction L.\n\nThen turn 89: from (2,5), I can move L to (1,5) or U to (2,6)\n\n(1,5) is better to reach (1,4).\n\nMove L to (1,5)\n\nThen head at (1,5), direction L.\n\nThen from (1,5), possible moves: U to (1,6), D to (1,4), R to (2,5) but (2,5) is body.\n\nNo reverse: direction L, so cannot move R.\n\nD to (1,4): food, so I can eat it.\n\nU to (1,6): free.\n\nSo I can move D to (1,4) to eat the food.\n\nBut need to check if safe.\n\n(1,4) is free, no body there.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows, so tail doesn't move.\n\nBut no immediate danger.\n\nSince life span is 9, I have time, but I can eat it now.\n\nAt turn 89, if I am at (1,5), I can move to (1,4) on turn 90? Let's see the turns.\n\nTurn 86: move to (4,5)\n\nTurn 87: move to (3,5)\n\nTurn 88: move to (2,5)\n\nTurn 89: move to (1,5)\n\nTurn 90: from (1,5), move D to (1,4) to eat.\n\n(1,4) life span 9, at turn 86, by turn 90 it will have life span 9 - (90-86) = 9-4=5, still available.\n\nturns: turn 86, food life 9\n\nturn 87, life 8\n\nturn 88, life 7\n\nturn 89, life 6\n\nturn 90, life 5, still there.\n\nYes.\n\nI could go directly, but from (2,5) at turn 88, I could move down to (2,4), but (2,4) is occupied by snake body.\n\nIn positions, (2,4) is occupied, so I cannot move there.\n\nOnly way is via (1,5) or (1,3), but (1,3) is below.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can only go to (1,5) or (2,6) at turn 89.\n\nThen from (1,5), to (1,4).\n\nNow, after eating (1,4), snake grows, so length increases by 1.\n\nBut need to survive after that.\n\nSince I have to output actions for several turns, I can list from turn 86 to, say, turn 90.\n\nBut at turn 90, I eat the food.\n\nIn the sequence, I need to specify actions.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 87, when I move to (3,5), and turn 88 to (2,5), both are free, no issue.\n\nThen to (1,5), then to (1,4).\n\nBut when I move to (1,4) on turn 90, I eat the food, so snake grows, tail doesn't move.\n\nBut before that, the tail is moving, freeing space.\n\nIn this path, I am going to the top-left, which has free space.\n\nAfter eating, I need to find a way out, but since I ate, snake is longer, but I can move to other free cells.\n\nFor example, from (1,4), after eating, head at (1,4), direction D (since moved down from (1,5)? When I move from (1,5) to (1,4), direction is down, so new head direction D.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (1,5) but (1,5) is body now? After eating, positions: head (1,4), then the previous positions with tail not moving.\n\nWhen head moves to food, it eats, so the new segment is added at head, tail stays.\n\nSo from turn 89: head at (1,5), body: let's trace.\n\nStart from turn 86 move U: head (4,5)\n\nTurn 87 move L: head (3,5), body: (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), ..., up to (5,3) tail\n\nTurn 88 move L: head (2,5), body: (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), ..., (5,3) but tail moves? No, when no food, tail moves.\n\nAt turn 88, move to (2,5), no food eaten, so tail moves.\n\nNew positions: head (2,5), seg1 (3,5), seg2 (4,5), seg3 (4,4), ..., up to seg19 (5,3)? Similar shifting.\n\nTail at turn 88: after move, tail is (5,2) or something, but not important.\n\nThen turn 89 move to (1,5): head (1,5), and since moved left, direction L.\n\nThen turn 90 move D to (1,4): eat food, so snake grows, new head (1,4), and tail stays, so the segment that was tail remains.\n\nPositions: head (1,4), then seg1: (1,5), seg2: (2,5), seg3: (3,5), ..., and all previous segments, with no tail movement, so length 21 now.\n\nFrom (1,4), direction D.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (1,5) - but (1,5) is seg1, body, collision if I move there.\n\nD to (1,3) - may be free.\n\nL to (0,4) wall, invalid.\n\nR to (2,4) - but (2,4) is body, occupied.\n\nSo only possible move is D to (1,3), if free.\n\n(1,3) should be free.\n\nMove to (1,3).\n\nThen from there, and so on.\n\nBut I have space to move.\n\nIn this case, I eat the food at turn 90.\n\nBut I need to think about the initial choice.\n\nAt turn 87, I chose to move L to (3,5), but I could move R to (5,5).\n\nIf I move R to (5,5) at turn 87, then head at (5,5), direction R.\n\nThen I can move U to (5,6), R to (6,5), or D to (5,4) but (5,4) body, or L to (4,5) but (4,5) body.\n\nDirection R, cannot move L (reverse).\n\nD to (5,4) body, collision.\n\nSo moves: U to (5,6), R to (6,5)\n\nThen I go to top-right, but (1,4) is bottom-left, far away, and with life 9, I can go later, but it might be riskier if I get trapped.\n\nThe bottom area has more snake body, so moving to the top is safer.\n\nAlso, in the left path, I can eat the food sooner.\n\nMoreover, at turn 86, if I don't move up, I die by moving down.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 86: move U\n\nTurn 87: move L to (3,5)\n\nTurn 88: move L to (2,5)\n\nTurn 89: move L to (1,5)\n\nTurn 90: move D to (1,4) to eat food.\n\nBut at turn 90, I eat, so for the action, on turn 90, I move D to (1,4).\n\nNow, I need to output actions from turn 86 onwards for several turns, but since the food is eaten by turn 90, and I survive, it should be fine.\n\nThe answer format should include the actions.\n\nBut I need to specify for each turn.\n\nAlso, for turn 86, action is U.\n\nIn the sequence, I have turns 86 to 90.\n\nBut turn 90 is when I eat, but I can stop earlier or later.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", and I have 5 turns: 86,87,88,89,90.\n\nI can list those.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 88, when I move to (2,5), and at turn 89 to (1,5), both are fine.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 88, from (3,5), I could move U to (3,6) instead of L to (2,5), but that delays going to (1,4), so better to go directly.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nSo I think this is a good plan.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: L\n\nTurn 88: L\n\nTurn 89: L\n\nTurn 90: D\n\nNow, in the box.\n\nBut let's confirm the directions.\n\nAt turn 86, from (4,4) move U to (4,5)\n\nTurn 87, from (4,5) move L to (3,5)\n\nTurn 88, from (3,5) move L to (2,5)\n\nTurn 89, from (2,5) move L to (1,5)\n\nTurn 90, from (1,5) move D to (1,4)\n\nAll moves are valid, no collision, and I eat the food at turn 90.\n\nPerfect.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, the AI must avoid the immediate dead end that would result from moving down at turn 86 and instead navigate towards the positive food at (1,4), which has a life span of 9 and can be eaten safely within the next few turns. Moving down at turn 86 leads to a dead end by turn 88, as the snake would be trapped with no valid moves. Instead, moving up at turn 86 opens a path to the top-left area, where the food at (1,4) is accessible.\n\nThe food at (2,5) with life span 1 cannot be eaten on turn 86, as it is too far from the head position (4,4), so it will disappear after this turn. The food at (1,1) with life span 3 is also unreachable by turn 88 (the last turn it can be eaten), so it must be ignored to focus on the achievable food at (1,4).\n\nThe planned sequence moves the snake towards (1,5) and then down to (1,4) to eat the food on turn 90. This path avoids collisions, respects movement constraints (no instant reverse), and ensures the snake survives beyond the 5-turn horizon. After eating the food on turn 90, the snake grows by one segment and can continue navigating the available space for future rewards.\n\n**Action Sequence (5 turns ahead):**\n\n- **Turn 86**: Move U (up) to (4,5) to avoid the dead end and access the top area.  \n- **Turn 87**: Move L (left) to (3,5) to head towards the left side where food (1,4) is located.  \n- **Turn 88**: Move L (left) to (2,5) to continue the path to (1,5).  \n- **Turn 89**: Move L (left) to (1,5) to position for eating the food.  \n- **Turn 90**: Move D (down) to (1,4) to eat the positive food (+1 score, snake length increases).\n\nThis sequence safely eats the food at (1,4) on turn 90 and ensures the snake remains in a viable position for further moves.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 86: U\nTurn 87: L\nTurn 88: L\nTurn 89: L\nTurn 90: D\n}",

There's also an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: The head is at (4,5), and the body segments follow. Let me list them in order:\n\n- Head: (4,5)\n\n- Then: (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3)\n\nThat's 20 segments.

Let's confirm: positions show (4,4) is the first body segment after head, so head moved from (4,4) to (4,5) with direction U.\n\nNow, food items:\n\n- (1,1) with value 1 and life span 3. So it will disappear after 3 turns, including this turn. Since current turn is 87, it will disappear after turn 89? Life span decreases every turn, including current. So if life span is 3 at turn 87, it will be gone after turn 89, meaning it can be eaten on turns 87, 88, or 89.\n\n- (1,4) with value 1 and life span 8. So it will be around for 8 turns from now, until turn 94.\n\nBoth are positive food, value +1 each.\n\nI need to move the snake. Possible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1). But I cannot do an instant reverse. Since current head direction is U, I cannot move D (down) on this turn.\n\nSo forbidden move: D.\n\nAllowed moves: U, L, R.\n\nNow, let's see the grid. I should sketch this to visualize.\n\nGrid is 8x8, walls at borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: head at (4,5). Let me plot the snake body.\n\nFrom head: (4,5)\n\nThen (4,4), so below head.\n\nThen (5,4) – right of (4,4)\n\nThen (6,4) – further right\n\nThen (6,3) – down\n\n(6,2) – down\n\n(6,1) – down, near bottom\n\n(5,1) – left\n\n(4,1) – left\n\n(3,1) – left\n\n(2,1) – left\n\n(2,2) – up\n\n(2,3) – up\n\n(2,4) – up\n\n(3,4) – right\n\n(3,3) – down\n\n(3,2) – down\n\n(4,2) – right\n\n(5,2) – right\n\n(5,3) – up\n\n(5,3) is the tail? Positions end with (5,3), and there are 20 segments.\n\nNow, food at (1,1) and (1,4).\n\n(1,1) is at the bottom-left, and (1,4) is left, y=4.\n\nSince snake head is at (4,5), and direction U, so it can move to:\n\n- U: (4,6) – but (4,6) is an obstacle? Internal obstacle at (4,6), so it's a wall. Cannot move there.\n\nInternal obstacles are walls, so (4,6) is blocked.\n\n- L: (3,5)\n\n- R: (5,5)\n\n- D: but forbidden, since reverse.\n\nSo possible moves from (4,5):\n\n- U: (4,6) – wall, invalid\n\n- D: (4,4) – but (4,4) is occupied by body? (4,4) is the first body segment, so moving to (4,4) would be collision with body, but let's check the rules.\n\nRules: body collision if head touches any body segment except the tail, because when moving, if head moves to tail cell, it might be ok if tail moves away.\n\nSpecifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, for a move to be valid, the target cell must not be a wall, not be a body segment except if it is the tail and tail will move.\n\nIn this case, moving to (4,4): (4,4) is occupied by the body, and it is not the tail; tail is at (5,3). So moving to (4,4) would cause collision, since the body there doesn't move away immediately? When the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and each segment moves to the next position, so the tail moves forward, freeing the last cell.\n\nBut at the moment of move, if head moves to a cell occupied by a body segment, it collides, except if that segment is the current tail, because after the move, the tail moves away, so it doesn't occupy that cell anymore.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\nFrom core rules: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, moving to a cell that is occupied by the tail is allowed because the tail will move, so no collision.\n\nMoving to a cell occupied by any other body segment is a collision and death.\n\nAlso, walls are deadly.\n\nSo for (4,5), possible moves:\n\n- U: (4,6) – wall, invalid\n\n- D: (4,4) – now, (4,4) is occupied by the first body segment. Is it the tail? No, tail is at (5,3), so (4,4) is not tail, so moving to (4,4) would collide with body, invalid.\n\n- L: (3,5) – what is at (3,5)? From snake positions, (3,5) is not listed. Snake positions: from (4,5) to (5,3), all positions are given. Let's list all occupied cells.\n\nSnake positions: (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3)\n\nSo (3,5) is not occupied, and not a wall? Walls are borders and (4,6). (3,5) is within bounds: x=3, y=5, x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so (3,5) is free? But is it a border? Border walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (3,5) is not on border, and not internal obstacle, so should be free.\n\nInternal obstacles only (4,6), so (3,5) is empty.\n\n- R: (5,5) – similarly, not occupied, not wall.\n\nSo possible moves: L to (3,5) or R to (5,5).\n\nD is invalid because reverse and also (4,4) is body.\n\nU is invalid because wall.\n\nSo only L or R.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead to maximize score and avoid risks.\n\nFood available: (1,1) with life span 3, so it can be eaten on turn 87,88,89.\n\n(1,4) with life span 8, so turns 87 to 94.\n\n(1,1) is closer to the current position? Head at (4,5), (1,1) is at bottom-left, (1,4) is at left, y=4.\n\nDistance to (1,1): from (4,5) to (1,1), that's |4-1|=3 in x, |5-1|=4 in y, so Manhattan distance 7.\n\nTo (1,4): |4-1|=3 in x, |5-4|=1 in y, distance 4.\n\nBut there are obstacles and body in the way.\n\nAlso, (1,1) has short life, only 3 turns left, including current.\n\nTurn 87: life span 3, so after this turn, if not eaten, life span becomes 2 on turn 88, then 1 on turn 89, gone after that.\n\nSimilarly for (1,4), life span 8, so it will last until turn 94.\n\nNow, to reach (1,1) from (4,5), it might take several moves, and with distance 7, it's hard to reach in 3 turns unless I go directly.\n\nBut there might be paths.\n\nFirst, let's see what happens if I move L or R now.\n\nOption 1: Move L to (3,5)\n\nThen head at (3,5), direction was U, but after move, new direction is L? Head direction changes to the move direction.\n\nAfter moving, the head direction is set to the move direction.\n\nIn state, head direction is given, but after move, it updates.\n\nFrom (4,5) move L to (3,5), so new head position (3,5), and head direction becomes L.\n\nThen the body follows: the segment that was at (4,4) moves to where head was, (4,5)? No.\n\nWhen snake moves, head moves to new cell, then each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo after moving head to (3,5), the first body segment (which was at (4,4)) moves to the old head position (4,5), but (4,5) is now free? Let's think.\n\nBefore move: head at (4,5), body: seg1 at (4,4), seg2 at (5,4), etc., tail at (5,3).\n\nAfter move L: head moves to (3,5). Then seg1 moves to (4,5) (previous head position), seg2 moves to (4,4) (previous seg1 position), and so on, until tail moves to previous position of second last segment.\n\nIn this case, after move, positions become:\n\nHead: (3,5)\n\nThen body: (4,5)  // old head\n\nThen (4,4)  // old seg1\n\n(5,4)  // old seg2\n\n(6,4)  // and so on\n\nThe tail was at (5,3), so the new tail will be where the old second last segment was? Let's see the sequence.\n\nOld positions: index 0: (4,5) head, 1: (4,4), 2: (5,4), 3: (6,4), 4: (6,3), 5: (6,2), 6: (6,1), 7: (5,1), 8: (4,1), 9: (3,1), 10: (2,1), 11: (2,2), 12: (2,3), 13: (2,4), 14: (3,4), 15: (3,3), 16: (3,2), 17: (4,2), 18: (5,2), 19: (5,3) tail\n\nAfter move L, head to (3,5), so new position 0: (3,5)\n\nThen position 1: old pos0 (4,5)\n\nPosition 2: old pos1 (4,4)\n\nPosition 3: old pos2 (5,4)\n\n...\nUp to position 19: old pos18 (5,2)? The last segment moves to where the old second last was.\n\nGenerally, for a snake of length L, after move, the new body segments are the old positions from 0 to L-2, but shifted.\n\nNew head: new position\n\nNew segment 1: old head position\n\nNew segment 2: old segment 1 position\n\n...\n\nNew segment k: old segment k-1 position for k=1 to L-1\n\nNew tail: old segment L-2 position? Let's index from 0.\n\nAfter move, new positions:\n\n- Head: new cell\n\n- Body segment i for i=1 to L-1: old position of segment i-1\n\nSince segments are indexed from head to tail.\n\nOld: seg0 (head), seg1, seg2, ..., seg19 (tail)\n\nAfter move to new cell:\n\nNew seg0 (head) at new cell\n\nNew seg1 at old seg0\n\nNew seg2 at old seg1\n\n...\n\nNew seg19 at old seg18\n\nSo the old tail position (old seg19) is vacated.\n\nIn this case, after moving to (3,5), new head at (3,5)\n\nNew seg1 at old head (4,5)\n\nNew seg2 at old seg1 (4,4)\n\nNew seg3 at old seg2 (5,4)\n\n...\n\nNew seg19 at old seg18 (5,2)\n\nOld seg18 was (5,2), so new tail at (5,2)\n\nOld tail (5,3) is now free.\n\nSimilarly, if I move R to (5,5), new head at (5,5), new seg1 at (4,5), etc.\n\nBack to choices.\n\nAt (4,5), I can go L to (3,5) or R to (5,5).\n\nNow, I need to think about getting to food.\n\nFirst, food at (1,1): life span 3, so I have turns 87,88,89 to eat it.\n\nFrom (4,5), to reach (1,1), I need to go left and down.\n\nBut after moving to (3,5), I can then go L to (2,5), D to (3,4), or U to (3,6), etc.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nAlso, there is the snake body to consider.\n\nFor example, (3,4) is occupied; it's in the snake body. Position (3,4) is seg14 in the list, but after move, positions change.\n\nI should simulate a few moves.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving towards (1,4) since it's closer in y, and life span longer.\n\n(1,4) is at x=1,y=4.\n\nFrom (4,5), moving L to (3,5) gets closer in x.\n\nThen from (3,5), I could go L to (2,5), but (2,5) is not occupied? Current snake positions: (2,5) is not listed, so free.\n\nThen from (2,5) to (1,5), then to (1,4), but (1,4) is food, but I need to reach it.\n\n(1,4) is at y=4, so from (1,5) I can go D to (1,4).\n\nBut let's see how many moves: from (4,5) to (3,5) turn 87, then to (2,5) turn 88, then to (1,5) turn 89, then to (1,4) turn 90. But (1,4) can be eaten on turn 90, and life span is 8, so turn 87+7=94? Life span at turn 87 is 8, so it decreases to 7 on turn 88, 6 on 89, ..., 0 on turn 94, so it exists until turn 94, can be eaten on turns 87 to 94 inclusive? Life span decreases every turn, so at turn t, if life span is L, it can be eaten on that turn, and after that, if not eaten, life span decreases to L-1 at next turn.\n\nWhen life span reaches 0, it disappears before the turn? The rule says: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo at turn t, with life span L, it can be eaten on turn t. After turn t, if not eaten, life span becomes L-1 for turn t+1. When life span becomes 0, it disappears after that turn, so cannot be eaten on the turn when life span is 0.\n\nFor (1,1): life span 3 at turn 87. So:\n\n- Turn 87: can be eaten, life span 3\n\n- Turn 88: if not eaten, life span 2\n\n- Turn 89: if not eaten, life span 1\n\n- Turn 90: if not eaten, life span 0, disappears, so cannot be eaten on turn 90 or later.\n\nSimilarly for (1,4): life span 8 at turn 87.\n\n- Can be eaten turns 87 to 94 (since on turn 94, life span 1, after eaten or not, on turn 95 it would be 0 and disappear).\n\nBack to (1,4): from current position (4,5), moving L to (3,5) on turn 87.\n\nThen on turn 88, from (3,5), I can move L to (2,5), assuming (2,5) is free. Is it? Current state, (2,5) not occupied, no wall.\n\nThen turn 89, from (2,5) to (1,5)\n\nThen turn 90, from (1,5) to (1,4) to eat food.\n\nBut (1,4) can be eaten on turn 90, which is before turn 94, so ok.\n\nBut I can reach it in 3 moves from now? Turns: turn 87 move to (3,5), turn 88 to (2,5), turn 89 to (1,5), turn 90 to (1,4). So 4 moves to eat, on turn 90.\n\nBut turn 90 is within life span.\n\nNow, what about (1,1)? It has only until turn 89.\n\nFrom (4,5) to (1,1) is farther.\n\nFor example, from (4,5) move L to (3,5) turn 87.\n\nThen from (3,5) move D to (3,4), but (3,4) is occupied? Current state, (3,4) is seg14, but after move to (3,5), positions change.\n\nAfter turn 87 move L to (3,5), new positions:\n\nHead: (3,5)\n\nSeg1: (4,5)  // old head\n\nSeg2: (4,4)  // old seg1\n\nSeg3: (5,4)  // old seg2\n\nSeg4: (6,4)  // old seg3\n\nSeg5: (6,3)  // old seg4\n\nSeg6: (6,2)  // old seg5\n\nSeg7: (6,1)  // old seg6\n\nSeg8: (5,1)  // old seg7\n\nSeg9: (4,1)  // old seg8\n\nSeg10: (3,1)  // old seg9\n\nSeg11: (2,1)  // old seg10\n\nSeg12: (2,2)  // old seg11\n\nSeg13: (2,3)  // old seg12\n\nSeg14: (2,4)  // old seg13\n\nSeg15: (3,4)  // old seg14? Old seg14 was (3,4), yes.\n\nOld positions: after move, new seg1 is old head (4,5), new seg2 is old seg1 (4,4), ..., new seg15 is old seg14 (3,4)\n\nList new positions after move to (3,5):\n\n- Head: (3,5)\n\n- Body: \n  - seg1: old head (4,5)\n  - seg2: old seg1 (4,4)\n  - seg3: old seg2 (5,4)\n  - seg4: old seg3 (6,4)\n  - seg5: old seg4 (6,3)\n  - seg6: old seg5 (6,2)\n  - seg7: old seg6 (6,1)\n  - seg8: old seg7 (5,1)\n  - seg9: old seg8 (4,1)\n  - seg10: old seg9 (3,1)\n  - seg11: old seg10 (2,1)\n  - seg12: old seg11 (2,2)\n  - seg13: old seg12 (2,3)\n  - seg14: old seg13 (2,4)\n  - seg15: old seg14 (3,4)\n  - seg16: old seg15 (3,3)\n  - seg17: old seg16 (3,2)\n  - seg18: old seg17 (4,2)\n  - seg19: old seg18 (5,2)  // new tail\n\nOld seg18 was (5,2), so new tail at (5,2)\n\nOld tail (5,3) is free.\n\nNow at turn 88, head at (3,5), direction L (since last move L).\n\nPossible moves: since direction L, cannot move R (reverse).\n\nCan move U, D, L.\n\nU to (3,6): y=6, not border, not wall? Border walls y=7 is wall, y=6 is not border. Internal walls only (4,6), so (3,6) should be free. But is it occupied? New positions: (3,6) not in list, so free.\n\nD to (3,4): but (3,4) is occupied by seg15 in new positions? New seg15 is at (3,4), which is body, not tail. Tail is at (5,2), so (3,4) is body, so moving to (3,4) would collide.\n\nL to (2,5): (2,5) not occupied, not wall.\n\nSo from (3,5), possible moves: U to (3,6), L to (2,5), or D but D to (3,4) invalid, so only U or L.\n\nIf I want to go to (1,4), I can go L to (2,5) on turn 88.\n\nThen on turn 89, head at (2,5), direction L, can move L to (1,5), or D to (2,4), etc.\n\n(2,4) is occupied? After turn 88, if I move to (2,5), new head (2,5), new seg1 at (3,5), etc.\n\nBut (2,4) is part of body? In current after turn 87, (2,4) is seg14.\n\nBut after move to (2,5) on turn 88, positions change.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4) is food, at (1,4).\n\nFrom (2,5) on turn 89, I can move D to (2,4), but (2,4) may be occupied or not.\n\nSince I'm moving towards (1,4), let's assume I go directly.\n\nTurn 89 from (2,5) move L to (1,5)\n\nThen turn 90 from (1,5) move D to (1,4) to eat.\n\nBut (1,4) can be eaten on turn 90.\n\nNow for (1,1), it's at (1,1), and I need to eat by turn 89.\n\nFrom current, it's turn 87, head at (4,5).\n\nTo reach (1,1) in 2 moves? Impossible, Manhattan distance 7, min moves 7, but with obstacles.\n\nFrom (4,5) to (1,1), I need at least 3 moves, e.g., L to (3,5), then D to (3,4), but (3,4) occupied, or L to (2,5) then D to (2,4), etc., but (2,4) also occupied.\n\nCurrent state, (3,4) and (2,4) are occupied by snake.\n\nAfter moving, some cells free.\n\nFor example, from (4,5) move L to (3,5) turn 87.\n\nThen at (3,5), I can move D to (3,4) but (3,4) is occupied after move, as above.\n\nAfter turn 87 move to (3,5), (3,4) is occupied by seg15.\n\nI can move to other directions.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move U to (3,6) or L to (2,5).\n\nIf I move U to (3,6), then I'm going away from (1,1).\n\nOr L to (2,5).\n\nThen at (2,5) on turn 88, I can move D to (2,4) or L to (1,5), etc.\n\nBut (2,4) is occupied after turn 87? After turn 87, (2,4) is seg14, which is body.\n\nAfter move to (2,5) on turn 88, let's see positions.\n\nTurn 88: from (3,5) move to (2,5), new head (2,5)\n\nNew seg1: old head (3,5)\n\nNew seg2: old seg1 (4,5)\n\nNew seg3: old seg2 (4,4)\n\n...\n\nNew seg19: old seg18 (5,2) but old seg18 was (5,2), new tail at (5,2)\n\nNow, (2,4): in new positions, what is at (2,4)? Old seg13 was (2,4), but after move, new seg14 is old seg13 (2,4)? Let's list:\n\nAfter turn 88 move to (2,5):\n\n- Head: (2,5)\n\n- Seg1: (3,5)  // old head\n\n- Seg2: (4,5)  // old seg1\n\n- Seg3: (4,4)  // old seg2\n\n- Seg4: (5,4)  // old seg3\n\n- Seg5: (6,4)  // old seg4\n\n- Seg6: (6,3)  // old seg5\n\n- Seg7: (6,2)  // old seg6\n\n- Seg8: (6,1)  // old seg7\n\n- Seg9: (5,1)  // old seg8\n\n- Seg10: (4,1)  // old seg9\n\n- Seg11: (3,1)  // old seg10\n\n- Seg12: (2,1)  // old seg11\n\n- Seg13: (2,2)  // old seg12\n\n- Seg14: (2,3)  // old seg13\n\n- Seg15: (2,4)  // old seg14? Old seg14 was (2,4), yes. In old after turn 87, seg14 was (2,4)\n\nAfter turn 87, seg14 is at (2,4)\n\nAfter move to (2,5) on turn 88, new seg14 is old seg13 (2,3)? I'm confusing myself.\n\nAfter turn 87 move to (3,5), positions are as above.\n\nThen from there, move to (2,5) on turn 88:\n\nNew head: (2,5)\n\nNew body:\n\n- Seg1: previous head (3,5)\n\n- Seg2: previous seg1 (4,5)\n\n- Seg3: previous seg2 (4,4)\n\n- Seg4: previous seg3 (5,4)\n\n- Seg5: previous seg4 (6,4)\n\n- Seg6: previous seg5 (6,3)\n\n- Seg7: previous seg6 (6,2)\n\n- Seg8: previous seg7 (6,1)\n\n- Seg9: previous seg8 (5,1)\n\n- Seg10: previous seg9 (4,1)\n\n- Seg11: previous seg10 (3,1)\n\n- Seg12: previous seg11 (2,1)\n\n- Seg13: previous seg12 (2,2)\n\n- Seg14: previous seg13 (2,3)\n\n- Seg15: previous seg14 (2,4)  // (2,4) is occupied by seg15\n\n- Seg16: previous seg15 (3,4)  // (3,4)\n\n- etc.\n\nSo at (2,5), I can move on turn 89.\n\nPossible moves: direction L (from last move L), so cannot move R.\n\nCan move U, D, L.\n\nU to (2,6): free?\n\nD to (2,4): but (2,4) is occupied by seg15, body, not tail, so collision.\n\nL to (1,5): (1,5) not occupied, not wall.\n\nSo only U or L.\n\nIf I move L to (1,5) on turn 89, then head at (1,5).\n\nThen I can move to (1,4) on turn 90 to eat.\n\nBut for (1,1), on turn 89, I am at (1,5) or somewhere, not at (1,1), so I can't eat (1,1) on turn 89.\n\nFrom (1,5) to (1,1) is 4 steps down, so impossible to reach by turn 89.\n\nIf I go directly down earlier, but from (4,5) or (3,5), I can't go down because of body.\n\nFor example, from (4,5) move R to (5,5) instead.\n\nLet's consider that option.\n\nAt turn 87, move R to (5,5).\n\nThen new head at (5,5), new seg1 at (4,5), new seg2 at (4,4), etc.\n\nDirection now R.\n\nFrom (5,5), possible moves: since direction R, cannot move L.\n\nCan move U, D, R.\n\nU to (5,6): y=6, free? Not border, not wall.\n\nD to (5,4): but (5,4) is occupied? After move, (5,4) is seg3 or something, body, not tail.\n\nAfter move to (5,5):\n\nNew head: (5,5)\n\nSeg1: (4,5)\n\nSeg2: (4,4)\n\nSeg3: (5,4)  // old seg2\n\nSeg4: (6,4)  // old seg3\n\netc.\n\nSo (5,4) is seg3, body, so moving D to (5,4) invalid.\n\nR to (6,5): (6,5) not occupied, but x=6, not wall? Border x=7 is wall, x=6 is not, so free.\n\nU to (5,6): free.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (5,6) or R to (6,5).\n\nNo way to go left or down easily.\n\nTo reach (1,1) or (1,4) from here is harder, since I'm moving right.\n\n(1,4) is left, so moving R takes me away.\n\nSo better to move L initially to get closer to (1,4).\n\nBut (1,1) has short life, and I can't reach it in time, so I should forget about (1,1) and focus on (1,4), which is achievable.\n\nThere might be other paths.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (1,1) is under the snake body? Current state, food at (1,1), and snake has segment at (2,1), (3,1), etc., but (1,1) is not occupied by snake? Snake positions include (2,1), (3,1), but not (1,1), so it's free, not under body.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4) is free.\n\nBut for (1,1), to eat it, I need to be at (1,1) with head.\n\nBut with only 3 turns, from (4,5), I need to cover 7 units in 3 moves, impossible since max Manhattan move is 3, but with obstacles, it's less.\n\nFor example, to go from (4,5) to (1,1), I need to move left 3 and down 4, but min moves is 7.\n\nIn 3 moves, I can only reduce distance by 3, so at best to (1,4) or (2,3), etc., not (1,1).\n\nSpecifically, after 3 moves, from (4,5), I can be at, say, (1,5) if I go left three times, but (1,5) is not (1,1), or (4,2) if down, but not possible.\n\nSo I cannot reach (1,1) by turn 89, so it will disappear uneaten.\n\nTherefore, I should ignore (1,1) and go for (1,4).\n\nNow, to reach (1,4), as before, move L to (3,5) on turn 87.\n\nThen on turn 88, from (3,5) move L to (2,5)\n\nThen on turn 89, from (2,5) move L to (1,5)\n\nThen on turn 90, from (1,5) move D to (1,4) to eat.\n\nBut on turn 89, from (2,5), I could move D to (2,4), but (2,4) is occupied, as we saw earlier.\n\nIn the sequence, when at (2,5) on turn 89, after previous moves.\n\nLet's trace the positions.\n\nTurn 87: move L to (3,5)\n\nPositions: head (3,5), body: (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2)  // tail at (5,2)\n\n(2,4) is occupied.\n\nTurn 88: move L to (2,5)\n\nNew head: (2,5)\n\nNew body: seg1: (3,5), seg2: (4,5), seg3: (4,4), seg4: (5,4), seg5: (6,4), seg6: (6,3), seg7: (6,2), seg8: (6,1), seg9: (5,1), seg10: (4,1), seg11: (3,1), seg12: (2,1), seg13: (2,2), seg14: (2,3), seg15: (2,4), seg16: (3,4), seg17: (3,3), seg18: (3,2), seg19: (4,2)  // new tail at (4,2)\n\nSo (2,4) is seg15, occupied.\n\nFrom (2,5), possible moves: direction L, so cannot R.\n\nU to (2,6): free\n\nD to (2,4): occupied, invalid\n\nL to (1,5): free\n\nSo only U or L.\n\nIf I move L to (1,5), then head at (1,5)\n\nThen turn 89 positions: head (1,5), seg1: (2,5), seg2: (3,5), etc.\n\nThen on turn 90, I can move D to (1,4) to eat, since (1,4) is food and free? (1,4) is food position, not occupied by snake.\n\nIn positions, (1,4) is not in the body, so yes.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows, so length becomes 21.\n\nBut I need to think about risks.\n\nNow, after eating at (1,4), I need to survive.\n\nAlso, when I move to (1,4), it's food, so I eat it, head moves there, and since it's positive food, length increases, so the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added.\n\nRule: when eating positive food, length increases by one, so the tail stays, and a new segment is added at the tail position? No.\n\nStandard Snake: when you eat food, the head moves to the food cell, and since length increases, the tail doesn't move for that turn, so the snake grows by one.\n\nIn terms of positions: head moves to food cell, and the body follows, but since length increases, the last position is not vacated, so the tail stays in place.\n\nFor example, before eating, head at A, body to tail at Z.\n\nAfter moving to food F, new head at F, then body moves to old head, etc., but since length increases, the tail doesn't move, so the new tail is the old tail, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position? I think I have it.\n\nTypically: if no food, head moves to new cell, tail moves away from old tail.\n\nIf food eaten, head moves to food, but tail does not move, so the segment that was tail remains, and a new segment is added at the food cell? No.\n\nLet's think: when head moves to a food cell, it consumes the food, so the snake grows. Therefore, after moving head to the food, the body segments shift, but the tail does not advance; instead, a new segment is added at the position where the tail was before moving? No.\n\nStandard: when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail end, but since the tail doesn't move, the snake grows by one cell.\n\nIn position terms: suppose positions before move: [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nIf move to empty cell, new positions: [newH, H, B1, B2, ..., B_{k-1}] and T is removed.\n\nIf move to food, new positions: [newH, H, B1, B2, ..., T] so T is still there, and the snake is longer.\n\nYes.\n\nSo in this case, when I move to (1,4) and eat, the tail doesn't move.\n\nBack to the plan.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead for survival.\n\nAlso, there might be risks.\n\nFor example, after going to (1,5), then to (1,4), but (1,4) is at y=4, x=1, near border.\n\nAfter eating, I need to find a way out.\n\nThe grid has walls, and snake body.\n\nMoreover, at (1,4), after eating, head is at (1,4), and I need to move to avoid collision.\n\nPossible moves from (1,4): after moving D to (1,4) on turn 90.\n\nDirection D (since last move D).\n\nThen can move L, R, D? Cannot move U, reverse.\n\nL: x=0, which is wall, border x=0, so invalid.\n\nR: (2,4), but (2,4) may be occupied.\n\nD: (1,3), which might be free.\n\nBut let's see the state at that time.\n\nFirst, I need to plan the moves.\n\nSince I have to output actions for multiple turns, but I need to think ahead, but the state changes, so I should plan a sequence.\n\nBut the food might be eaten or not, and positions change.\n\nSince (1,1) will disappear anyway, and I can't eat it, focus on (1,4).\n\nNow, at turn 87, move L to (3,5).\n\nThen turn 88, move L to (2,5).\n\nThen turn 89, move L to (1,5).\n\nThen turn 90, move D to (1,4) to eat.\n\nNow, after that, on turn 90, after eating, positions: head at (1,4), body: since I moved from (1,5) to (1,4), so new head (1,4), new seg1: old head (1,5), then seg2: previous seg1, etc., and since food eaten, tail doesn't move, so the last segment stays.\n\nBefore move on turn 90: head at (1,5), body: let's say from turn 89 positions.\n\nTurn 89: after moving to (1,5) on turn 89.\n\nHow did I get there.\n\nTurn 87: move to (3,5)\n\nTurn 88: move to (2,5)\n\nTurn 89: move to (1,5)\n\nSo at turn 89, positions: head (1,5)\n\nSeg1: (2,5)  // from previous head\n\nSeg2: (3,5)  // previous seg1\n\nSeg3: (4,5)  // previous seg2\n\n...\n\nI need the full list, but it might be messy.\n\nSince the snake is long, many cells are occupied.\n\nAt (1,5), on turn 89, before move.\n\nPositions: head (1,5)\n\nSeg1: (2,5)\n\nSeg2: (3,5)\n\nSeg3: (4,5)\n\nSeg4: (4,4)\n\nSeg5: (5,4)\n\n... and so on, down to tail, which is at some position.\n\nFrom turn 88 after move to (2,5), positions: as earlier, tail at (4,2) or something.\n\nAfter turn 88 move to (2,5), positions: head (2,5), seg1 (3,5), seg2 (4,5), seg3 (4,4), seg4 (5,4), seg5 (6,4), seg6 (6,3), seg7 (6,2), seg8 (6,1), seg9 (5,1), seg10 (4,1), seg11 (3,1), seg12 (2,1), seg13 (2,2), seg14 (2,3), seg15 (2,4), seg16 (3,4), seg17 (3,3), seg18 (3,2), seg19 (4,2)  // tail\n\nThen turn 89 move to (1,5): new head (1,5), new seg1 (2,5), new seg2 (3,5), new seg3 (4,5), new seg4 (4,4), new seg5 (5,4), new seg6 (6,4), new seg7 (6,3), new seg8 (6,2), new seg9 (6,1), new seg10 (5,1), new seg11 (4,1), new seg12 (3,1), new seg13 (2,1), new seg14 (2,2), new seg15 (2,3), new seg16 (2,4), new seg17 (3,4), new seg18 (3,3), new seg19 (3,2)  // new tail at (3,2)\n\nOld tail was (4,2), now free.\n\nNow on turn 90, move D to (1,4) to eat food at (1,4).\n\nSince food eaten, snake grows, so new positions: head moves to (1,4), and since food eaten, tail does not move, so new segments: head (1,4), seg1: old head (1,5), seg2: old seg1 (2,5), seg3: old seg2 (3,5), ..., up to old seg19 (3,2), and since length increases, the tail stays, so the new tail is old seg19, at (3,2).\n\nPositions: head (1,4), seg1 (1,5), seg2 (2,5), seg3 (3,5), seg4 (4,5), seg5 (4,4), seg6 (5,4), seg7 (6,4), seg8 (6,3), seg9 (6,2), seg10 (6,1), seg11 (5,1), seg12 (4,1), seg13 (3,1), seg14 (2,1), seg15 (2,2), seg16 (2,3), seg17 (2,4), seg18 (3,4), seg19 (3,3), seg20 (3,2)  // new segment added? When eating, the tail doesn't move, so the last segment remains.\n\nBefore move, positions: head (1,5), seg1 (2,5), ..., seg19 (3,2)\n\nAfter moving to (1,4) and eating, new head at (1,4), new seg1 at old head (1,5), new seg2 at old seg1 (2,5), ..., new seg20 at old seg19 (3,2), so the snake is now 21 segments, with tail at (3,2).\n\nNow, head at (1,4), direction D (since moved down).\n\nPossible moves: since direction D, cannot move U (reverse).\n\nCan move L, R, D.\n\nL: (0,4) - x=0, wall, invalid.\n\nR: (2,4) - what is at (2,4)? In positions, (2,4) is seg17, which is body, not tail, so occupied, collision if move there.\n\nD: (1,3) - is it free? (1,3) not in positions, not wall, so should be free.\n\nAlso, since direction D, moving D is allowed.\n\nSo only possible move is D to (1,3).\n\nThen on turn 91, head at (1,3), direction D.\n\nThen can move D to (1,2), or L to (0,3) invalid, or R to (2,3).\n\n(2,3) is seg16 or something, but positions change.\n\n(1,2) might be free.\n\nBut I'm going down to (1,1), but (1,1) is gone by now, since turn 90, life span 0.\n\n(1,1) was gone after turn 89.\n\nSo (1,3) should be free.\n\nMove D to (1,3) on turn 90.\n\nThen turn 91, from (1,3), move D to (1,2), assuming free.\n\nThen turn 92, from (1,2) move D to (1,1), but (1,1) is empty, no food, and if I go there, it's just a move.\n\nBut (1,1) might be close to body.\n\nAt (1,2), I could move R to (2,2), etc.\n\nBut I need to think about long-term survival.\n\nAfter going to (1,3), I might be trapped.\n\nFor example, at (1,3), after turn 90 move.\n\nPositions after turn 90: head (1,3)? On turn 90, I moved to (1,4) and ate, so head at (1,4), then I move to (1,3) on turn 90? Turn 90 is the move to (1,4), eating.\n\nThen for turn 91, I move from (1,4) to (1,3).\n\nBut in the sequence, turn 90: move to (1,4) eat.\n\nThen turn 91: from (1,4) move to (1,3).\n\nDirection D.\n\nNew head at (1,3), new seg1 at (1,4), and so on, tail at (3,2) or wherever.\n\n(1,3) is free now.\n\nThen from (1,3), direction D, can move D to (1,2), or R to (2,3), or L invalid.\n\n(1,2) free? Probably.\n\n(2,3) might be occupied.\n\nBut let's not detail.\n\nThe point is, by going to (1,4), I am at the left edge, and moving down might lead to a dead end if I reach (1,1) or something.\n\n(1,1) is bottom-left, and from there, only up or right, but right might be blocked.\n\nBut at (1,2), I can move R to (2,2), which might be free or not.\n\nBut in general, it might be risky.\n\nPerhaps I should consider not going directly to (1,4) but taking a different path.\n\nAnother option: at turn 87, instead of moving L, move R to (5,5).\n\nBut that takes me away from food, and (1,4) might be eaten later, but life span is long, so I can go later.\n\nBut I need to maximize score, so I should eat it soon to have room for other food, but no other food mentioned, only these two, and (1,1) will disappear.\n\nAfter eating (1,4), I might be stuck.\n\nLet's see the grid.\n\nThe snake body occupies many cells, but as it moves, some free up.\n\nFor example, when I move left, the tail is at (5,2) or moving, so cells free up.\n\nIn the initial move, if I move L to (3,5), then on turn 88, I could move U to (3,6) instead of L.\n\nBut that might delay eating.\n\nSince I need to think 5 turns ahead, let's list the moves.\n\nTurn 87: must choose L or R. R takes me right, away from food, so better L to (3,5).\n\nThen turn 88: from (3,5), I can move L to (2,5) or U to (3,6).\n\nIf I move U to (3,6), then I am at (3,6), direction U.\n\nThen I can move U to (3,7), but y=7 is wall, invalid.\n\nL to (2,6), or R to (4,6), but (4,6) is obstacle, wall.\n\nD to (3,5), but (3,5) is body after move, invalid.\n\nAfter moving to (3,6), new positions: head (3,6), seg1 (3,5), seg2 (4,5), etc.\n\n(3,5) is seg1, body, so moving D to (3,5) invalid.\n\nSo from (3,6), can move L to (2,6) or R to (4,6) invalid, U invalid, D invalid, so only L to (2,6).\n\nThen at (2,6), and so on.\n\nBut this takes me up, away from food, and I might not reach (1,4) in time, but it has long life, so I can go later.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should eat it soon.\n\nAlso, there might be risks in other directions.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (1,4) is not under body, so I can eat it directly.\n\nBut let's consider the tail reward danger.\n\nRule: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nIn this case, when I eat at (1,4), the tail is at (3,2), which is not adjacent to (1,4). Distance |1-3|=2, |4-2|=2, not adjacent, so no danger.\n\nAdjacent means sharing a side, so Manhattan distance 1.\n\n(1,4) and (3,2) are not adjacent.\n\nSo safe.\n\nNow, back to after eating.\n\nAfter being at (1,4) and moving down to (1,3), then to (1,2), etc.\n\nAt (1,2), I can move R to (2,2).\n\n(2,2) might be occupied or not, but as the snake moves, it might free up.\n\nFor example, in the positions after turn 90, (2,2) is seg15 at (2,2), but as I move down, it changes.\n\nBut to avoid risk, perhaps I should not go to the corner.\n\nAnother idea: instead of going directly to (1,5) then (1,4), from (2,5) on turn 89, I could move down if possible, but not, since (2,4) occupied.\n\nOn turn 88, from (3,5), if I move D, but (3,4) occupied, so I can't.\n\nSo the only way to (1,4) is via (1,5) or other, but (1,4) is below, so I need to go down at some point.\n\nFrom (1,5) to (1,4) is down.\n\nI could go to (1,4) from the right, but from (2,4), it is occupied initially.\n\nBut after some moves, it might be free.\n\nFor example, if I don't move left immediately, but the life span is long, so I can wait.\n\nBut to eat soon, I should go for it.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (1,4) in a different way.\n\nLet's list all possible actions for turn 87.\n\nMove L to (3,5) or R to (5,5).\n\nIf I move R to (5,5), then I am at (5,5), direction R.\n\nThen on turn 88, I can move U to (5,6) or R to (6,5).\n\nIf U to (5,6), then at (5,6), direction U.\n\nThen can move U to (5,7) wall invalid, L to (4,6) wall, R to (6,6), or D to (5,5) body invalid.\n\nR to (6,6): free? x=6,y=6, not border, not wall.\n\nOr D invalid.\n\nSo only R to (6,6).\n\nSimilarly, if I move R to (6,5) on turn 88, etc.\n\nBut this is going to the top-right, away from food.\n\nThen to reach (1,4) later, it might take many turns, and I might hit body or walls.\n\nWhereas going left, I can eat soon.\n\nMoreover, after eating, I can maneuever.\n\nFor example, after eating at (1,4) and moving down to (1,3), then to (1,2), then to (1,1) but no food, then to (2,1) or something.\n\n(2,1) might be occupied, but let's see.\n\nAt turn 91, after moving to (1,3) on turn 91? Let's timeline.\n\nTurn 87: move L to (3,5)\n\nTurn 88: move L to (2,5)\n\nTurn 89: move L to (1,5)\n\nTurn 90: move D to (1,4) eat\n\nNow turn 91: from (1,4) move D to (1,3)  // only choice, as above\n\nPositions after turn 90: head (1,4), body (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)  // tail at (3,2)\n\nThen turn 91 move D to (1,3): new head (1,3), new seg1 (1,4), new seg2 (1,5), new seg3 (2,5), ..., new seg21 (3,2)  // tail moved? No, since no food, so tail moves away.\n\nAfter moving to empty cell, tail moves.\n\nNew positions: head (1,3), seg1 (1,4), seg2 (1,5), seg3 (2,5), seg4 (3,5), seg5 (4,5), seg6 (4,4), seg7 (5,4), seg8 (6,4), seg9 (6,3), seg10 (6,2), seg11 (6,1), seg12 (5,1), seg13 (4,1), seg14 (3,1), seg15 (2,1), seg16 (2,2), seg17 (2,3), seg18 (2,4), seg19 (3,4), seg20 (3,3)  // new tail at (3,3), old tail (3,2) free.\n\nNow head at (1,3), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: D to (1,2), R to (2,3), or L invalid.\n\n(1,2) free? Yes.\n\n(2,3) is seg17, body, occupied, so cannot move R.\n\nSo only D to (1,2).\n\nTurn 92: move D to (1,2)\n\nNew head (1,2), seg1 (1,3), etc., tail at (3,4) or something.\n\nThen from (1,2), direction D, can move D to (1,1), L invalid, R to (2,2).\n\n(1,1) free, (2,2) may be occupied.\n\nIf move D to (1,1), then at (1,1), then only move R to (2,1) or U, but U is reverse if direction D.\n\nDirection D, so cannot U.\n\nCan move L invalid, R to (2,1), D to (1,0) wall invalid.\n\n(2,1) is in body? In positions, after move, (2,1) is seg15 or something.\n\nBut at (1,2), after move to (1,2), positions: head (1,2), seg1 (1,3), seg2 (1,4), seg3 (1,5), seg4 (2,5), seg5 (3,5), ..., down to seg20 (3,4) or let's not list.\n\n(2,1) is likely occupied.\n\nFor example, from previous, seg15 was (2,1), but after moves, it changes.\n\nBut (2,1) might be body.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) might be body.\n\nSo from (1,2), moving R to (2,2) might be invalid if occupied.\n\nMoving D to (1,1) is possible.\n\nThen at (1,1), I can only move R to (2,1), if possible.\n\nBut if (2,1) is body, collision.\n\nIn the long run, I might get trapped.\n\nTo avoid this, I should not go to (1,4) directly, but approach from below or something, but (1,4) is at y=4, and I am at y=5, so I have to go down.\n\nFrom the initial position, at turn 88, when at (3,5), instead of moving L to (2,5), I could move U to (3,6), but then I have to go L to (2,6), then down, but (1,4) is at y=4, so I need to go down eventually.\n\nBut it takes more turns.\n\nFor example, turn 87: L to (3,5)\n\nTurn 88: U to (3,6)\n\nTurn 89: L to (2,6)\n\nTurn 90: D to (2,5) or something, but (2,5) may be occupied.\n\nThen to reach (1,4), it takes longer.\n\nAnd (1,4) life span long, so possible, but I eat later, but since no other food, it's ok, but I might miss if something happens.\n\nBut to avoid the corner, I can do that.\n\nTurn 87: move L to (3,5)\n\nTurn 88: move U to (3,6)\n\nThen from (3,6), move L to (2,6) only choice.\n\nTurn 89: at (2,6), direction L, can move L to (1,6), D to (2,5), or U to (2,7) wall invalid.\n\n(1,6) free, (2,5) may be occupied.\n\nAfter turn 88 move to (3,6), positions: head (3,6), seg1 (3,5), seg2 (4,5), seg3 (4,4), etc.\n\n(2,5) not occupied, so can move D to (2,5).\n\nThen at (2,5), then I can move to (1,5) or (2,4), etc.\n\nBut still, to reach (1,4), I need to go down.\n\nBut this way, I am at (2,6) on turn 89, then I can move D to (2,5) on turn 90, then to (2,4) or (1,5), then to (1,4).\n\nBut (2,4) might be free later.\n\nFor example, on turn 90, at (2,5), I can move D to (2,4) if free.\n\nAfter turn 89 at (2,6), move D to (2,5) on turn 90.\n\nThen at (2,5), then move D to (2,4) or L to (1,5).\n\nIf (2,4) is free, I can move to (2,4), then to (1,4) or (2,3), etc.\n\nBut (1,4) is at (1,4), so from (2,4) I can move L to (1,4) to eat.\n\nAnd (2,4) might be free by then.\n\nIn initial, (2,4) is occupied, but after moves, it might be vacated.\n\nFor example, in the first sequence, when I moved left, on turn 88, (2,4) was occupied, but later, as tail moves, it might free.\n\nBut in this alternative, let's see.\n\nTo save time, since the food at (1,4) has long life, and I need to survive, going to the corner might be risky, so I should approach from a safer direction.\n\nBut in this case, from (4,5), moving L to (3,5) is fine, then on turn 88, instead of moving L to (2,5), I move U to (3,6), then to (2,6), then down to (2,5), then to (2,4) if free, then to (1,4).\n\nBut on turn 88 when at (3,5), if I move U to (3,6), then on turn 89 at (3,6) move L to (2,6), turn 90 at (2,6) move D to (2,5), then turn 91 at (2,5) move D to (2,4) if free, or L to (1,5).\n\nBut at turn 91, (2,4) might be free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4) can be eaten on turn 91 or later.\n\nLife span 8, turn 87 to 94, so turn 91 is fine.\n\nAnd by not going directly to (1,5), I avoid the corner temporarily.\n\nAfter eating at (1,4), I am at (1,4), but I can move R to (2,4) if free, or D to (1,3).\n\nBut (2,4) might be free by then.\n\nLet's assume I go this way.\n\nFor turn 87, move L to (3,5).\n\nThen for turn 88, move U to (3,6).\n\nThen turn 89, move L to (2,6).\n\nThen turn 90, from (2,6) move D to (2,5).\n\nThen at (2,5), I can move to (1,5) or (2,4) or (2,6) but reverse not allowed.\n\nDirection from moving D to (2,5), so direction D.\n\nCan move L to (1,5), R to (3,5), or D to (2,4).\n\n(1,5) free, (3,5) may be occupied, (2,4) may be free.\n\nIf (2,4) free, I can move D to (2,4), then from there move L to (1,4) to eat.\n\nOr move L to (1,5), then D to (1,4).\n\nBut moving to (2,4) first might be better if possible.\n\nTo determine if (2,4) is free at that time.\n\nAt turn 90, when I am at (2,6) moving to (2,5), let's see positions.\n\nTurn 87: move L to (3,5) - positions as before.\n\nTurn 88: move U to (3,6) - new head (3,6), seg1 (3,5), seg2 (4,5), seg3 (4,4), ..., tail at (4,2) or something.\n\nTail was at (5,2), but after moves, new tail at (4,2) or earlier.\n\nAfter turn 88 move to (3,6): new head (3,6), seg1 (3,5), seg2 (4,5), seg3 (4,4), seg4 (5,4), seg5 (6,4), seg6 (6,3), seg7 (6,2), seg8 (6,1), seg9 (5,1), seg10 (4,1), seg11 (3,1), seg12 (2,1), seg13 (2,2), seg14 (2,3), seg15 (2,4), seg16 (3,4), seg17 (3,3), seg18 (3,2), seg19 (4,2)  // tail at (4,2)\n\n(2,4) is seg15, occupied.\n\nTurn 89: move L to (2,6) - new head (2,6), seg1 (3,6), seg2 (3,5), seg3 (4,5), seg4 (4,4), ..., seg19 (4,2) but new seg19 is old seg18 (3,2)? New seg1 (3,6), new seg2 (3,5), new seg3 (4,5), new seg4 (4,4), new seg5 (5,4), new seg6 (6,4), new seg7 (6,3), new seg8 (6,2), new seg9 (6,1), new seg10 (5,1), new seg11 (4,1), new seg12 (3,1), new seg13 (2,1), new seg14 (2,2), new seg15 (2,3), new seg16 (2,4), new seg17 (3,4), new seg18 (3,3), new seg19 (3,2)  // tail at (3,2)\n\n(2,4) is new seg16, occupied.\n\nTurn 90: move D to (2,5) - new head (2,5), seg1 (2,6), seg2 (3,6), seg3 (3,5), seg4 (4,5), seg5 (4,4), seg6 (5,4), seg7 (6,4), seg8 (6,3), seg9 (6,2), seg10 (6,1), seg11 (5,1), seg12 (4,1), seg13 (3,1), seg14 (2,1), seg15 (2,2), seg16 (2,3), seg17 (2,4), seg18 (3,4), seg19 (3,3)  // tail at (3,3)\n\n(2,4) is seg17, occupied.\n\nSo at (2,5), on turn 90, moving D to (2,4) is invalid because (2,4) occupied.\n\nMoving L to (1,5) is possible, or R to (3,5) but (3,5) is seg3, occupied, or D invalid.\n\n(3,5) is seg3, body, so moving R invalid.\n\nL to (1,5) valid, U to (2,6) but reverse, not allowed, direction D, so cannot U.\n\nSo only L to (1,5).\n\nThen same as before.\n\nSo I end up at (1,5) anyway.\n\nThen on turn 91, I can move to (1,4) to eat.\n\nTurn 90 at (2,5) move L to (1,5), then turn 91 at (1,5) move D to (1,4) eat.\n\nThen turn 92 from (1,4) move D to (1,3), etc.\n\nThe same situation.\n\nTo avoid the corner, I need to eat the food when I am coming from below or side, but since it's at (1,4), and I am above, I have to go down.\n\nPerhaps I should move right first to free space, but that might take too long.\n\nOr accept the risk and after eating, move down and then right when possible.\n\nFor example, at (1,2), I can move R to (2,2) if free.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 92, after eating on turn 91? Let's define.\n\nTurn 91: move to (1,4) and eat? No.\n\nIn the first sequence:\n\nTurn 90: move to (1,4) eat\n\nTurn 91: move to (1,3)\n\nTurn 92: move to (1,2)\n\nThen at (1,2), direction D, can move D to (1,1) or R to (2,2).\n\n(1,1) free, (2,2) may be occupied.\n\nIf I move R to (2,2), and if free, I can escape the column.\n\nBut (2,2) might be body.\n\nAfter turn 92 move to (1,2), positions: head (1,2), seg1 (1,3), seg2 (1,4), seg3 (1,5), seg4 (2,5), seg5 (3,5), ..., seg21 (3,3) or something, but (2,2) might be free or not.\n\nFrom previous, after turn 91 move to (1,3), positions: head (1,3), seg1 (1,4), seg2 (1,5), seg3 (2,5), seg4 (3,5), seg5 (4,5), seg6 (4,4), seg7 (5,4), seg8 (6,4), seg9 (6,3), seg10 (6,2), seg11 (6,1), seg12 (5,1), seg13 (4,1), seg14 (3,1), seg15 (2,1), seg16 (2,2), seg17 (2,3), seg18 (2,4), seg19 (3,4), seg20 (3,3), seg21 (3,2)  // after eating, tail didn't move, so longer.\n\nAfter turn 91 move to (1,3) (empty cell), new head (1,3), new seg1 (1,4), new seg2 (1,5), new seg3 (2,5), new seg4 (3,5), new seg5 (4,5), new seg6 (4,4), new seg7 (5,4), new seg8 (6,4), new seg9 (6,3), new seg10 (6,2), new seg11 (6,1), new seg12 (5,1), new seg13 (4,1), new seg14 (3,1), new seg15 (2,1), new seg16 (2,2), new seg17 (2,3), new seg18 (2,4), new seg19 (3,4), new seg20 (3,3)  // new tail at (3,3), old tail (3,2) free.\n\nSo (2,2) is seg16, occupied.\n\nThen on turn 92, at (1,2), after moving from (1,3) to (1,2), new positions: head (1,2), seg1 (1,3), seg2 (1,4), seg3 (1,5), seg4 (2,5), seg5 (3,5), seg6 (4,5), seg7 (4,4), seg8 (5,4), seg9 (6,4), seg10 (6,3), seg11 (6,2), seg12 (6,1), seg13 (5,1), seg14 (4,1), seg15 (3,1), seg16 (2,1), seg17 (2,2), seg18 (2,3), seg19 (2,4), seg20 (3,4)  // tail at (3,4)\n\n(2,2) is seg17, occupied, so cannot move R.\n\nOnly move D to (1,1).\n\nTurn 93: move to (1,1), then from there, can only move R to (2,1), but (2,1) is seg16, occupied, collision.\n\nDeath.\n\nSo if I go to the corner, I die on turn 93 or 94.\n\nTherefore, going directly to (1,4) is suicidal.\n\nI must avoid that.\n\nSo for turn 87, I should not move L, but move R to (5,5).\n\nThen from there, I can go to other areas.\n\nFor example, move R to (5,5) on turn 87.\n\nThen turn 88, move U to (5,6) or R to (6,5).\n\nSay move U to (5,6).\n\nThen turn 89, from (5,6) move R to (6,6) only choice.\n\nThen at (6,6), direction R, can move R to (7,6) but x=7 wall invalid, U to (6,7) wall invalid, D to (6,5), or L to (5,6) body invalid.\n\nD to (6,5): free? Not occupied.\n\nSo move D to (6,5).\n\nThen at (6,5), and so on.\n\nBut this is top-right, and the food at (1,4) is far, but I can go left later.\n\nFor example, from (6,5), I can move L to (5,5) or D to (6,4), etc.\n\nBut (5,5) may be body.\n\nAfter some moves, the body moves, cells free.\n\nSince (1,4) has life span 8, I have until turn 94 to eat it.\n\nFrom current position, I can plan a path to (1,4) in 7 moves or less.\n\nBut it might be complicated.\n\nPerhaps there is no immediate danger, so I can move R to explore.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should eat the food.\n\nAnother idea: the food at (1,1) can be eaten if I can reach it, but I can't in time.\n\nOr is there a way?\n\nFor example, if I move down from some point, but from (4,5), I can't move down.\n\nOnly from (3,5) or (5,5), but (3,4) or (5,4) occupied.\n\nSo impossible to reach (1,1).\n\nSo only (1,4) is the option.\n\nBut to eat it safely, I should not go to (1,5) first.\n\nHow about from (4,5) move L to (3,5) on turn 87.\n\nThen on turn 88, move D, but (3,4) occupied, not possible.\n\nMove U to (3,6), then to (2,6), then to (2,5), then to (2,4) if free, but as before, it's occupied.\n\nOn turn 88, at (3,5), I move U to (3,6).\n\nThen turn 89 at (3,6) move L to (2,6).\n\nTurn 90 at (2,6) move D to (2,5).\n\nTurn 91 at (2,5) move L to (1,5) or D to (2,4) if free, but not.\n\nSo move L to (1,5).\n\nTurn 92 at (1,5) move D to (1,4) eat.\n\nThen same as before, trapped.\n\nAt turn 91, at (2,5), I can move R to (3,5) but occupied, or U to (2,6) reverse not allowed.\n\nSo only L.\n\nTherefore, the only way is to go to the corner and die later.\n\nBut that can't be right; there must be a way to survive.\n\nPerhaps after eating at (1,4), instead of moving down, I can move right if possible, but at (1,4), I can only move down because R is occupied.\n\nUnless at that time (2,4) is free.\n\nIn the sequence when I eat at (1,4) on turn 90 or 92, (2,4) is occupied.\n\nFor example, in the first sequence, on turn 90 at (1,4), (2,4) is seg17 or something, occupied.\n\nIn the alternative, on turn 92 at (1,4), similarly occupied.\n\nSo I have to move down.\n\nThen I am trapped.\n\nSo to avoid this, I should not eat the food yet and move to open area first.\n\nFor turn 87, move R to (5,5).\n\nThen from (5,5), move U to (5,6) on turn 88.\n\nThen to (6,6) on turn 89.\n\nThen to (6,5) on turn 90.\n\nThen from (6,5), I can move L to (5,5) or D to (6,4), etc.\n\nBut (5,5) may be body, (6,4) may be body.\n\nAfter turn 90 at (6,5), positions depend.\n\nBut eventually, as the tail moves, cells free, so I can find a path to (1,4) later.\n\nFor example, from (6,5), move D to (6,4) if free.\n\nAt some point, (2,4) might be free.\n\nSince the snake is moving, the body changes.\n\nFor instance, the tail is moving, so cells like (5,3), (5,2) etc. free up.\n\nSo after a few turns, (2,4) might be free.\n\nThen I can approach (1,4) from (2,4).\n\nSo for now, to avoid risk, move R on turn 87.\n\nThen plan to go to (1,4) later.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe format is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but since state changes, I should output for the next few turns based on current state.\n\nBut with food life span, I need to commit.\n\nPerhaps for turn 87, move R to (5,5).\n\nThen for turn 88, from (5,5), move U to (5,6).\n\nThen turn 89, from (5,6) move R to (6,6).\n\nThen turn 90, from (6,6) move D to (6,5).\n\nThen turn 91, from (6,5) move D to (6,4) if free, etc.\n\nBut I don't know if free.\n\nSince the grid is small, and snake long, many cells occupied, but as it moves, some free.\n\nTo maximize survival, moving right might open space.\n\nBut let's see the initial move.\n\nPerhaps I can move L but not go all the way to (1,5).\n\nFor example, at turn 87 move L to (3,5).\n\nThen at turn 88, move U to (3,6).\n\nThen at turn 89, move L to (2,6).\n\nThen at turn 90, move D to (2,5).\n\nThen at turn 91, at (2,5), I can move L to (1,5) or, if possible, but only choices.\n\nThen at (1,5), I can move not to (1,4) immediately, but to (1,6) if possible, but y=6, (1,6) free, but then I am at (1,6), and (1,4) below, so I can move down later.\n\nBut (1,6) is top-left, still corner.\n\nThen from (1,6), I can move D to (1,5), then to (1,4) to eat, but same issue.\n\nOr from (1,6) move R to (2,6), etc.\n\nBut after eating, I might be less trapped.\n\nFor example, if I eat at (1,4) when I am at (1,5) moving D, but after eating, I am at (1,4), then if I can move R, but (2,4) occupied, so no.\n\nUnless I eat it when (2,4) is free.\n\nSo I need to wait until the snake moves and (2,4) is vacated.\n\nFor example, on turn 88, (2,4) is occupied, but later, as tail moves, it might be free.\n\nFor instance, the tail is at (5,2) initially, moving to (4,2), etc.\n\nBut it takes time.\n\nSuppose I do nothing for a few turns, but I have to move.\n\nFor turn 87, move R to (5,5) to avoid the left side.\n\nThen from there, I can go up or right.\n\nSince head direction is U, but after move R, direction R.\n\nThen move U to (5,6).\n\netc.\n\nThen later, when I go to (1,4), I can come from below or side.\n\nBut (1,4) is at y=4, so from below, (1,3) or (1,5) from above.\n\nBut (1,3) might be free.\n\nFor example, from (2,3), move L to (1,3), then U to (1,4) to eat.\n\nAnd if (2,3) is free at that time.\n\nIn initial, (2,3) is occupied, but later free.\n\nSo with life span 8, I can reach it.\n\nFor the answer, I need to provide actions for the next turns.\n\nPerhaps for turn 87, move R to (5,5).\n\nThen for turn 88, move U to (5,6).\n\nThen for turn 89, move R to (6,6).\n\nThen for turn 90, move D to (6,5).\n\nThen for turn 91, from (6,5) move D to (6,4) if free, or L to (5,5) if free.\n\nBut I have to assume based on current.\n\nSince the grid is known, I can simulate.\n\nBut it's tedious.\n\nPerhaps for survival, moving right is better.\n\nLet's count free cells.\n\nGrid 8x8 = 64 cells.\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, but corners are walls, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, but with internal wall at (4,6), so playable area: 6x6=36 minus 1 for (4,6), so 35 cells.\n\nSnake length 20, so 15 free cells.\n\nFood at (1,1) and (1,4), so free cells include those.\n\nAfter moves, free cells change.\n\nBut with snake moving, it can manuever.\n\nFor the immediate action, I think moving L is risky for long-term, so I'll move R.\n\nSo for turn 87: R\n\nThen for turn 88, from (5,5), move U to (5,6)\n\nThen turn 89, from (5,6), move R to (6,6)\n\nThen turn 90, from (6,6), move D to (6,5)\n\nThen turn 91, from (6,5), move D to (6,4) if possible, or L to (5,5) but (5,5) may be body.\n\nBut in answer, I can output the sequence.\n\nSince the state changes, I should output based on current state for each turn.\n\nBut for the response, I need to provide a sequence of actions for the next turns.\n\nI think for now, I'll go with moving R to avoid the left corner.\n\nSo action for turn 87: R (right)\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I can plan.\n\nBut let's provide 5 turns.\n\nTurn 87: R\n\nThen from (5,5), direction R, on turn 88, move U to (5,6) (up)\n\nThen from (5,6), direction U, on turn 89, move R to (6,6) (right)\n\nThen from (6,6), direction R, on turn 90, move D to (6,5) (down)\n\nThen from (6,5), direction D, on turn 91, move D to (6,4) (down), assuming (6,4) is free or will be, but in initial, (6,4) is body, but after moves, it might be free.\n\nAt turn 90, when I move to (6,5), (6,4) might be free.\n\nFor example, after turn 90 move to (6,5), positions depend on previous.\n\nBut it's messy.\n\nI think for the answer, I'll provide:\n\nTurn 87: R\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nTurn 89: R\n\nTurn 90: D\n\nTurn 91: D\n\nAnd hope (6,4) is free.\n\nIf not, I can change later, but for the output, I need to specify.\n\nPerhaps for turn 91, I can move L or something, but let's see.\n\nI think it's the best I can do.\n\nSo for the boxed answer.\n\nBut let's confirm the direction.\n\nCurrent head direction U, move R to (5,5), so new direction R.\n\nThen move U to (5,6), new direction U.\n\nThen move R to (6,6), new direction R.\n\nThen move D to (6,5), new direction D.\n\nThen move D to (6,4), new direction D.\n\nAnd (6,4) might be free after some moves.\n\nFor example, initially (6,4) is body, but when I move the head away, the body moves, so (6,4) might be vacated.\n\nIn the sequence, when I move to (5,5) on turn 87, (6,4) is still body, but later, when tail moves, it frees.\n\nAt turn 91, after several moves, (6,4) could be free.\n\nSo it should be ok.\n\nSimilarly, for the food, I can eat it later.\n\nSo I think this is safer.\n\nSo actions:\n</think>\nTo maximize long-term survival and score, the AI must carefully plan moves to eat the positive food at (1,4) with a life span of 8 turns (available until turn 94) while avoiding the risky left corner where the snake could become trapped. The food at (1,1) with a life span of 3 turns cannot be reached safely within its remaining life due to distance and body obstacles, so it is ignored. \n\nThe initial move from (4,5) with head direction \"U\" allows only \"L\" or \"R\" (since \"U\" is blocked by a wall at (4,6) and \"D\" is a reverse move and leads to body collision at (4,4)). Moving \"L\" to (3,5) risks trapping the snake in the left corner after eating (1,4), as subsequent moves force the snake down into a dead end with no escape. Instead, moving \"R\" to (5,5) is safer, opening space to maneuver and allowing a later approach to (1,4) from a less risky direction.\n\nAfter moving \"R\" to (5,5), the snake head direction becomes \"R\". From there, moves are planned to explore open areas while keeping (1,4) accessible. Moving \"U\" to (5,6) on turn 88 avoids immediate body collisions and heads toward less occupied space. Then, \"R\" to (6,6) on turn 89 continues to open space. On turn 90, \"D\" to (6,5) prevents wall collisions and maintains flexibility. Finally, \"D\" to (6,4) on turn 91 is chosen assuming (6,4) is free or will be freed by tail movement (as the tail progresses, cells like (6,4) may become vacant).\n\nThis sequence prioritizes survival by avoiding the left corner trap and positions the snake to reach (1,4) in later turns (e.g., via a path like (6,4) → (6,3) → (5,3) → ... → (1,4) when feasible). Thinking 5+ turns ahead, the snake can then eat (1,4) safely and continue exploring.\n\n**Action Sequence for Turns 87 to 91:**\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 87: R (right)  \nTurn 88: U (up)  \nTurn 89: R (right)  \nTurn 90: D (down)  \nTurn 91: D (down)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 88. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (4,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the borders and a block at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (5,5), and the body segments follow. The head direction is right (R), meaning it was moving to the right to reach (5,5).\n\nFood items:\n\n- (1,1) with value 1 and life span 2\n\n- (1,4) with value 1 and life span 7\n\n- (2,3) with value 1 and life span 10\n\nAll food is positive, since value is +1. No negative food here.\n\nI need to plan moves for at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid. I'll make a small grid representation to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders and (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: List of 20 segments? Let's count: [(5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2)]\n\nSo head at (5,5), tail at (5,2)? Let's order it properly.\n\nHead: (5,5)\n\nThen: (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2)\n\n(5,2) is the last one? But (5,2) is listed, and before that is (4,2), etc. Let's list all:\n\nIndex 0: (5,5) head\n\n1: (4,5)\n\n2: (4,4)\n\n3: (5,4)\n\n4: (6,4)\n\n5: (6,3)\n\n6: (6,2)\n\n7: (6,1)\n\n8: (5,1)\n\n9: (4,1)\n\n10: (3,1)\n\n11: (2,1)\n\n12: (2,2)\n\n13: (2,3)\n\n14: (2,4)\n\n15: (3,4)\n\n16: (3,3)\n\n17: (3,2)\n\n18: (4,2)\n\n19: (5,2) tail\n\nSo tail is at (5,2).\n\nNow, head is at (5,5), moving right. But it says \"Snake Head Direction: R\", which is the direction it's facing, so it was moving right to get to (5,5). So for the next move, from (5,5), it can move U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n\nCurrent direction is R, so it cannot move left immediately, because that would be instant reverse. So possible moves: U, D, R (not L).\n\nNo instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is R, so cannot move L on next turn.\n\nSo from (5,5), possible moves:\n\n- U: (5,6)\n\n- D: (5,4)\n\n- R: (6,5)\n\nNow, need to check if these are valid, not walls or body collision.\n\nFirst, walls: borders are walls, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSo (5,6): y=6, x=5. y=6 is not y=7 or y=0, so not border wall. (4,6) is a wall, but (5,6) is not (4,6), so should be free? Walls are specific cells: border cells meaning all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. And internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSo (5,6): x=5 not 0 or 7, y=6 not 0 or 7, and not (4,6), so no wall.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4): x=5, y=4, not border, not (4,6), ok.\n\n(6,5): x=6, y=5, not border, not (4,6), ok.\n\nNow, body collision: head should not touch any body segment except the tail, but when moving, if it moves to a cell that will be occupied by body when the snake moves, but since the tail moves, only the head moves, and body follows.\n\nCollision happens if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by a body part that will not become the tail. Specifically, after moving, the head should not be on the same cell as any body segment except possibly the current tail, because the tail will move away.\n\nStandard snake: when head moves to a new cell, if that cell is occupied by a body segment other than the tail, it collides. If it's the tail, it's ok because tail moves forward.\n\nAlso, if the cell has food, eating happens before the tail moves, so if head moves to tail cell, and tail has food, it might be dangerous if eating causes collision.\n\nBut in this case, food on tail cell: \"Tail Reward Danger\" – if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nLet's see where the tail is.\n\nTail is at (5,2).\n\nHead at (5,5), not adjacent to tail. Adjacent would be same row or column, one cell away.\n\n(5,5) to (5,2) is three cells away vertically, so not adjacent.\n\nNow, for possible moves from (5,5):\n\n- U to (5,6): what is there? Need to check if occupied or food.\n\nFirst, list all occupied cells by snake.\n\nFrom positions: (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2)\n\nSo cells occupied: let's list coordinates:\n\n- Row y=5: (5,5), (4,5)\n\n- y=4: (4,4), (5,4), (6,4)\n\n- y=3: (6,3), (2,3), (3,3)\n\n(6,3), (2,3), (3,3) – (3,3) is at y=3? Positions: (6,3) from index 5, (2,3) index 13, (3,3) index 16? Index 16 is (3,3), but y=3.\n\nList by coordinate:\n\n(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\n\n(3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n\n(4,1), (4,2), (4,4), (4,5)  -- missing (4,3)? Not occupied.\n\n(5,1), (5,2), (5,4), (5,5) -- (5,3) not occupied.\n\n(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) -- (6,5) not, etc.\n\nFood at (1,1), (1,4), (2,3)\n\n(2,3) has food, but (2,3) is occupied by snake? Snake positions include (2,3) at index 13, so (2,3) is part of snake body.\n\nFood at (2,3), but it's under the snake body. So it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves there.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) and (1,4) might be free or not.\n\n(1,1): is it occupied? Snake has (2,1), (3,1), etc., but not (1,1), so free.\n\n(1,4): not in snake positions, so free.\n\n(2,3) is occupied, so food is under body.\n\nBack to moves from (5,5):\n\nPossible actions: U, D, R (since L is reverse and not allowed)\n\n- Move U to (5,6): (5,6) not wall, not occupied? Snake positions: (5,6) not in list, so empty? But is it food? Food at (1,1), (1,4), (2,3) – no (5,6), so empty cell.\n\n- Move D to (5,4): (5,4) is occupied by snake, index 3. So if head moves to (5,4), which is currently occupied by a body segment (the segment that was at (5,4) before move). After move, this segment will be the second segment, so it's not the tail, so moving to (5,4) would cause collision because head touches body.\n\nWhen the head moves to a new cell, if that cell is occupied by any body part except the tail, it's collision. Here, (5,4) is occupied by the fourth segment (index 3), which is not the tail, so moving to (5,4) would be collision.\n\n- Move R to (6,5): (6,5) not wall, not occupied? Snake positions: no (6,5), so empty. Food? No, so just move.\n\nSo from (5,5), possible safe moves:\n\n- U to (5,6)\n\n- R to (6,5)\n\nD to (5,4) is invalid because collision.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead for multiple turns.\n\nAlso, food life spans: (1,1) life span 2, so it disappears after 2 turns, including current turn? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nCurrent turn is 88, so for (1,1), life span 2, so it will disappear after turn 89? Let's see: life span decreases every turn, including current.\n\nAt turn 88, life span is 2. After turn 88, life span becomes 1. After turn 89, life span 0, so it disappears before turn 90 or after? The food is present as long as life span >0, I assume.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for food with life span L at turn t, it will be there for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappear at the start of turn t+L? Or end?\n\nTypically, countdown decreases at the end of turn or beginning.\n\nBut to be precise: \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn t, with life span L, after the turn, it decreases to L-1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nThe food can be eaten on any turn as long as life span >0.\n\nFor (1,1): at turn 88, life span 2. After turn 88, it becomes 1. After turn 89, it becomes 0 and disappears, so it can be eaten on turn 88 or 89.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4) life span 7, so lasts until turn 88+6=94? Turn 88: L=7, after turn 88: L=6, ..., after turn 94: L=0, disappear before turn 95.\n\nTurn t, L initial, after k turns, L = initial - k.\n\nDisappears when L=0.\n\nSo for (1,1): L=2 at turn 88, can be eaten on turn 88 or 89.\n\n(1,4): L=7 at turn 88, can be eaten from turn 88 to 94.\n\n(2,3): L=10 at turn 88, to turn 97.\n\nBut (2,3) is currently under snake body, so it can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves there.\n\nNow, snake head at (5,5), and I need to plan moves.\n\nPossible immediate moves: U or R.\n\nIf I move U to (5,6), then head at (5,6), direction up.\n\nIf move R to (6,5), head at (6,5), direction right.\n\nNow, think about food.\n\n(1,1) is about to disappear soon, only available for 2 turns. But (1,1) is at bottom-left, while snake is at (5,5), which is center-right.\n\nDistance: from (5,5) to (1,1) is |5-1| + |5-1| = 4+4=8 cells, so it would take at least 8 moves to reach, but life span only 2 turns, so impossible to reach in time. Similarly, (1,4) is at (1,4), distance |5-1| + |5-4| =4+1=5, min 5 moves, life span 7, possible.\n\n(2,3) is at (2,3), distance |5-2| + |5-3| =3+2=5, min 5 moves, but it's under body, so need to free it first.\n\n(2,3) is currently occupied by snake body, segment at index 13.\n\nTo eat (2,3), we need to move the snake so that (2,3) is vacated, then head moves there.\n\nBut the snake is long, 20 segments, so moving the tail away takes time.\n\nSince the tail moves every turn, if we move in a way that the tail leaves (2,3), then head can move to (2,3).\n\nCurrently, tail is at (5,2), and (2,3) is a body segment.\n\nThe segment at (2,3) will move when the snake moves, depending on the path.\n\nTo free (2,3), we need the tail to pass through it or something, but it's not the tail.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the tail moves to the previous position of the second-last segment, but it's messy.\n\nThe cell (2,3) will be free only when the segment that occupies it moves away, and no new segment comes immediately, but since the snake moves as a whole, when the segment at (2,3) moves to another cell, (2,3) becomes empty, unless another part moves there, but in snake, each cell is vacated when the segment leaves.\n\nIn one move, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail cell is removed if no food eaten. If food eaten, tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n\nBut for a body cell to be vacated, it happens when the snake moves and the segment that was there moves to the next position, leaving the cell empty.\n\nSpecifically for (2,3), it is occupied by the 14th segment? Index from 0.\n\nHead (5,5) index 0, then (4,5)1, (4,4)2, (5,4)3, (6,4)4, (6,3)5, (6,2)6, (6,1)7, (5,1)8, (4,1)9, (3,1)10, (2,1)11, (2,2)12, (2,3)13, (2,4)14, (3,4)15, (3,3)16, (3,2)17, (4,2)18, (5,2)19 tail.\n\nSo (2,3) is index 13.\n\nWhen the snake moves, if no food eaten, the tail is removed, and each segment moves to the next position.\n\nSo after one move, the segment that was at index 13 moves to where index 12 was? Let's think of the positions shifting.\n\nAfter a move, the new head is at the new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it.\n\nSo for example, if head moves to new cell, then segment 1 moves to old head position, segment 2 moves to old segment 1 position, and so on, up to segment 19 moves to old segment 18 position, and the old tail (segment 19) position is vacated.\n\nThe cell that was occupied by the tail is always vacated after a move if no food eaten. If food eaten, tail stays, so no cell vacated.\n\nFor other body cells, they are never directly vacated; only the tail position is left empty when the snake moves without eating.\n\nTo vacate a body cell like (2,3), we need the snake to move in such a way that the segment at (2,3) becomes the tail at some point, or something.\n\nSince the snake is connected, the only way a body cell is vacated is if it is the tail position when the snake moves and no food is eaten, so it is left behind.\n\nOtherwise, when a segment moves, it leaves its previous position, but that position might be immediately occupied by the next segment if it's not the tail.\n\nIn a snake move, only one cell is vacated: the old tail position, if no food eaten.\n\nIf food eaten, no cell is vacated.\n\nFor a food under body, it can only be eaten when that cell is vacated by the snake and then head moves there.\n\nBut the cell is vacated only when it is the tail position and the snake moves without eating food.\n\nFor (2,3) to be free, it needs to become the tail, and then when the snake moves without eating, it leaves that cell.\n\nBut currently (2,3) is index 13, not tail. The tail is at (5,2), index 19.\n\nTo make (2,3) the tail, we need to shorten the snake or something, but we can only shorten by not eating, which makes the tail move.\n\nEach time we don't eat food, the tail moves forward, so the tail position changes.\n\nThe tail will eventually reach (2,3) if we move appropriately, but it might take many moves.\n\nLet's see the path from tail to head.\n\nThe snake positions are a path: from head (5,5) to tail (5,2) through the body.\n\nTo make (2,3) the tail, we need to have the segment at (2,3) be the last one, which means we need to move the snake so that the current tail is removed step by step until (2,3) is the end.\n\nSince each move without eating removes the tail, after k moves without eating, the new tail is what was k segments from the old tail.\n\nCurrently, (2,3) is 6 segments from the tail? Let's see the distance in the chain.\n\nFrom head to tail: index 0 to 19.\n\n(2,3) is index 13, so 19-13=6 segments after it, so after 6 moves without eating, the segment at index 13 would become the tail, and then on the 7th move, if no eat, (2,3) would be vacated.\n\nBut only if we don't eat during those moves; if we eat, the tail doesn't move, so it takes longer.\n\nAlso, when the tail moves, the position changes.\n\nCurrently, after one move without eating, tail moves to old position of index 18, which is (4,2).\n\nAfter two moves, to (3,2), and so on.\n\nLet's trace the tail positions if we don't eat.\n\nCurrent tail: (5,2) index 19\n\nAfter one move no eat: tail becomes index 18 position, which is (4,2)\n\nAfter two moves: tail at index 17 position, (3,2)\n\nAfter three: index 16, (3,3)\n\nAfter four: index 15, (3,4)\n\nAfter five: index 14, (2,4)\n\nAfter six: index 13, (2,3)\n\nAfter six moves without eating, the tail is at (2,3)\n\nThen, on the seventh move without eating, if head doesn't move to (2,3), the cell (2,3) is vacated, and then if head moves there later, it can eat the food.\n\nBut the food at (2,3) has life span 10, so it will be there for a while, but we need to free it first.\n\nBut this process takes at least 6 moves to make (2,3) the tail, then one more to vacate it, then head can move there, but after vacating, it might not be immediate.\n\nMoreover, during this time, the head is moving, so it might not be near (2,3) when it's free.\n\nThis seems inefficient and risky because the snake is long, and we might get trapped.\n\nPerhaps it's better to ignore (2,3) for now and go for other food.\n\n(1,1) is too far and will disappear soon, not reachable.\n\n(1,4) is at (1,4), which is free, and life span 7, so we can reach it.\n\nFrom (5,5) to (1,4), min distance 4 in x, 1 in y, so 5 moves.\n\nBut we need to plan a path.\n\nAlso, there might be other areas to explore.\n\nFirst, let's consider immediate move.\n\nFrom (5,5), move U to (5,6) or R to (6,5).\n\nIf I move U to (5,6), then head at (5,6), direction U.\n\nFrom there, possible moves U, D, L, R, but not D (reverse), so U, L, R.\n\n(5,6) is y=6, not wall.\n\nMove to (5,7)? y=7 is wall, so cannot move U to (5,7), because wall.\n\ny=7 is border wall, so (5,7) is invalid.\n\nFrom (5,6), possible moves: U to (5,7) is wall, invalid.\n\nD to (5,5) but (5,5) is where the neck is, so moving D would be collision with body, since (5,5) is now the first body segment.\n\nAfter moving U to (5,6), the body segments: head at (5,6), then segment 1 at old head (5,5), segment 2 at (4,5), etc.\n\nSo from (5,6), moving D to (5,5) would be moving to the cell occupied by segment 1, which is not tail, so collision.\n\nSimilarly, moving L to (4,6): (4,6) is internal obstacle, wall, so invalid.\n\nMoving R to (6,6): not wall, not occupied? Probably empty.\n\nSo from (5,6), only possible move is R to (6,6), since U wall, D collision, L wall.\n\nThen from (6,6), we can go R to (7,6), but x=7 wall, invalid; D to (6,5), which might be free; U to (6,7) wall; L to (5,6) but that's the neck, collision.\n\nAfter moving to (6,6), body: head at (6,6), segment 1 at (5,6), segment 2 at (5,5), etc.\n\nSo moving L to (5,6) would be to segment 1, collision.\n\nMoving D to (6,5): (6,5) might be free or not.\n\n(6,5) not in current snake, but after move, it could be.\n\nAt turn 88, (6,5) is empty.\n\nIf we move to (6,6) from (5,6), then from (6,6), moving D to (6,5) is possible, since (6,5) empty.\n\nThen we can go to (6,5), etc.\n\nBut this seems to be going towards the top-right, but there might be no food there.\n\nIf from (5,5) we move R to (6,5), then head at (6,5), direction R.\n\nFrom there, possible moves: U, D, R, not L (reverse).\n\nU to (6,6), D to (6,4), R to (7,5) but x=7 wall, invalid.\n\n(6,4) is occupied by snake, index 4, so moving D to (6,4) collision.\n\nMoving U to (6,6) empty.\n\nMoving R to (7,5) wall, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move U to (6,6).\n\nThen from (6,6), as before, only D to (6,5) or other, but (6,5) is now the neck if we came from there.\n\nIf we moved to (6,5) first, then to (6,6), then from (6,6), moving D to (6,5) would be to segment 1, collision.\n\nMoving L to (5,6) or R to (7,6) wall, U wall, so from (6,6) after moving from (6,5), only possible move is... U to (6,7) wall, R to (7,6) wall, D to (6,5) collision, L to (5,6) which might be empty.\n\n(5,6) is empty at this point.\n\nSo from (6,6), move L to (5,6).\n\nThen from (5,6), as before, only R to (6,6), but that's where we came from, and it would be occupied by body now.\n\nThis is getting messy, and we might get stuck in a loop or corner.\n\nThe area around (5,5) to (6,6) might be risky because of the walls and the snake body.\n\nPerhaps we should move in a way that goes towards the food at (1,4) or free (2,3).\n\n(1,4) is at (1,4), free, life span 7.\n\nFrom (5,5), min path to (1,4) is left and up or something.\n\n|dx| =4, |dy| =1, so need to go left 4, and down or up? y from 5 to 4, so down 1.\n\nBut we can move in any order.\n\nBut there are walls and body.\n\nFirst, to go left, we need to move L, but current direction R, so we can't move L immediately; we have to turn.\n\nFrom (5,5), we can move U or R as safe moves.\n\nIf we move U to (5,6), then from there, we can only move R to (6,6) as we saw, which is away from (1,4).\n\nIf we move R to (6,5), then to (6,6), also away.\n\nSo both immediate moves take us to (5,6) or (6,5), which are farther from (1,4).\n\nFrom (5,5), moving U or R increases x or y, while (1,4) is low x, low y.\n\n(1,4) is x=1,y=4, head at x=5,y=5, so to decrease x and decrease y.\n\nMoving D from (5,5) is invalid because (5,4) occupied.\n\nMoving L is invalid because reverse not allowed.\n\nSo we have to move U or R first, which doesn't help.\n\nBut after moving U or R, we can then turn to go left.\n\nFor example, from (5,5) move U to (5,6), then from (5,6) we can only move R to (6,6), as established.\n\nFrom (6,6), we can move L to (5,6) but that's back, or D to (6,5) if possible.\n\nFrom (6,6), after moving from (6,5), let's simulate.\n\nTurn 88: at (5,5), move R to (6,5). Head now at (6,5), direction R.\n\nBody: new positions: head (6,5), then segment 1: old head (5,5), segment 2: (4,5), segment 3: (4,4), segment 4: (5,4), segment 5: (6,4), segment 6: (6,3), etc. Tail at (5,2) moves to (4,2) if no eat, but since no food at (6,5), no eat, so tail moves, old tail (5,2) vacated.\n\nNew snake positions: head (6,5), then (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2)  -- tail at (4,2), since (5,2) vacated.\n\nLength 20, no eat, so tail removed, new tail is the previous second last, which was (4,2) index 18, now index 19.\n\nPositions: index 0: (6,5), 1: (5,5), 2: (4,5), 3: (4,4), 4: (5,4), 5: (6,4), 6: (6,3), 7: (6,2), 8: (6,1), 9: (5,1), 10: (4,1), 11: (3,1), 12: (2,1), 13: (2,2), 14: (2,3), 15: (2,4), 16: (3,4), 17: (3,3), 18: (3,2), 19: (4,2)  -- (4,2) was index 18, now tail.\n\nTurn 88+1 = turn 89.\n\nHead at (6,5), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,6), D to (6,4), R to (7,5) wall, L to (5,5) collision with segment 1.\n\nD to (6,4): (6,4) is occupied by segment 5, index 5, which is body, not tail, so collision.\n\nSo only possible move U to (6,6).\n\nMove U to (6,6). Head at (6,6), direction U.\n\nNew positions: head (6,6), then (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)  -- tail at (3,2), since no eat.\n\n(4,2) vacated.\n\nTurn 89+1 = turn 90.\n\nHead at (6,6), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,7) wall, D to (6,5) collision with segment 1 (6,5), L to (5,6), R to (7,6) wall.\n\nSo only L to (5,6).\n\nMove L to (5,6). Head at (5,6), direction L (since moving left).\n\nNew positions: head (5,6), then (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)  -- tail at (3,3), since (3,2) vacated? Previous tail (3,2), no eat, so removed, new tail at old (3,3) which was index 17, now index 19.\n\nPositions: index 0: (5,6), 1: (6,6), 2: (6,5), 3: (5,5), 4: (4,5), 5: (4,4), 6: (5,4), 7: (6,4), 8: (6,3), 9: (6,2), 10: (6,1), 11: (5,1), 12: (4,1), 13: (3,1), 14: (2,1), 15: (2,2), 16: (2,3), 17: (2,4), 18: (3,4), 19: (3,3)  -- tail (3,3)\n\nTurn 90+1 = turn 91.\n\nHead at (5,6), direction L (since moved left from (6,6) to (5,6)).\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,7) wall, D to (5,5) collision with segment 3 (5,5), R to (6,6) collision with segment 1 (6,6), L to (4,6) wall (internal obstacle).\n\nAll moves invalid! U wall, D collision, R collision, L wall. Snake is trapped!\n\nIf at turn 88 we moved U to (5,6), then from (5,6) only R to (6,6), then from (6,6) only D to (6,5) if possible, but at that point (6,5) might be occupied.\n\nLet's check.\n\nTurn 88: move U to (5,6). Head (5,6), direction U.\n\nPositions: head (5,6), then (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2)  -- tail (4,2)\n\nTurn 89.\n\nHead at (5,6), direction U.\n\nMoves: U wall, D collision ( (5,5) is segment 1), L wall (4,6), so only R to (6,6).\n\nMove R to (6,6). Head (6,6), direction R.\n\nPositions: head (6,6), then (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)  -- tail (3,2)\n\nTurn 90.\n\nHead at (6,6), direction R.\n\nMoves: R wall, U wall, D to (6,5), L to (5,6) collision (segment 1 (5,6)).\n\nD to (6,5): (6,5) is empty? At this turn, (6,5) not occupied, so possible.\n\nMove D to (6,5). Head (6,5), direction D.\n\nPositions: head (6,5), then (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)  -- tail (3,3)\n\nThen from (6,5), we can move U to (6,6) collision, D to (6,4) which is segment 7 (6,4), collision, L to (5,5) collision, R wall. Only D is possible but occupied, U occupied, L occupied, R wall. Trapped again!\n\nSo in both cases, if we go to (5,6) or (6,5), we end up in a position where we can only move to (6,6) or (5,6) and then get stuck.\n\nTherefore, moving U or R from (5,5) leads to a dead end quickly.\n\nBut we have to move to one of them, or is there another way?\n\nAt (5,5), only U and R are safe moves, D and L are invalid.\n\nBut both lead to trap.\n\nPerhaps we can eat food to change the situation.\n\nBut there is no food nearby.\n\n(2,3) has food but under body.\n\nOr (1,4) is far.\n\nAnother idea: since moving U or R is bad, but we have to choose one, and then try to escape.\n\nBut from the simulation, after a few moves, we get stuck.\n\nPerhaps at turn 88, we can move R to (6,5), then at turn 89 move U to (6,6), then at turn 90 move L to (5,6), then at (5,6), we are stuck as before.\n\nSame with U then R.\n\nBut in the first simulation, when we moved R then U then L, at (5,6) on turn 91, we had no moves.\n\nSimilarly in second.\n\nSo we need to avoid going to (5,6) or (6,6) area.\n\nBut from (5,5), we can only go there.\n\nUnless we can move down, but (5,4) is occupied, so we can't.\n\nPerhaps we can wait or something, but we have to move.\n\nAnother thought: the food at (2,3) is under body, but if we move the snake, we might be able to eat it soon.\n\nBut as we saw, it takes many moves to free it.\n\nLet's list the cells near head that are empty.\n\nAt (5,5), adjacent cells: U (5,6) empty, D (5,4) occupied, L (4,5) occupied, R (6,5) empty.\n\nSo only U and R empty.\n\nBut (4,5) is occupied, it's segment 1.\n\n (5,4) occupied, segment 3.\n\nSo no other choices.\n\nPerhaps we can go towards the left by first moving up or right, then down or left.\n\nBut from (5,6) or (6,5), we can only go to (6,6) or back, which is bad.\n\nLet's look at the grid.\n\nI am considering the grid layout.\n\nDraw a grid, x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all border cells are walls, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal wall at (4,6).\n\nSo accessible cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (4,6) is wall.\n\nBut (4,6) is wall, so no cell at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: let's list all occupied cells to find free cells.\n\nFrom snake: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,1), (4,2), (4,4), (4,5), (5,1), (5,2), (5,4), (5,5), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n\nSo missing cells: for example, (1,1) food, (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) food, (1,5), (1,6), (2,5), (2,6), (3,5), (3,6) but (3,6) not, y=6, x=3, but (4,6) wall, so (3,6) is not wall? Walls are only border and (4,6), so (3,6) is free but not occupied by snake.\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) not occupied, (5,3) not, (6,5) not, (6,6) not, (5,6) not, etc.\n\nFree cells: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,5), (2,6), (3,5), (3,6), (4,3), (5,3), (5,6), (6,5), (6,6), (3,0) but y=0 wall, so only y=1 to 6, x=1 to 6.\n\nx=1: y=1 to 6: (1,1) food, (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) food, (1,5), (1,6)\n\nx=2: y=1 to 6: (2,1) snake, (2,2) snake, (2,3) snake/food, (2,4) snake, (2,5) free, (2,6) free\n\nx=3: (3,1) snake, (3,2) snake, (3,3) snake, (3,4) snake, (3,5) free, (3,6) free\n\nx=4: (4,1) snake, (4,2) snake, (4,3) free, (4,4) snake, (4,5) snake, (4,6) wall\n\nx=5: (5,1) snake, (5,2) snake, (5,3) free, (5,4) snake, (5,5) snake, (5,6) free\n\nx=6: (6,1) snake, (6,2) snake, (6,3) snake, (6,4) snake, (6,5) free, (6,6) free\n\nAlso (7,y) all wall, (0,y) wall, etc.\n\nSo free cells include: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,5), (2,6), (3,5), (3,6), (4,3), (5,3), (5,6), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nFood at (1,1), (1,4), and (2,3) under snake.\n\nHead at (5,5), to reach (1,4), we need to go left and down.\n\nBut from (5,5), we can only go to (5,6) or (6,5), both of which are not helpful.\n\nFrom (5,6), we can only go to (6,6), then from (6,6) to (6,5) or (5,6), but both lead to problems.\n\nPerhaps we can go to (5,3) or other free cells.\n\n(5,3) is free, below (5,4).\n\nIf we could move down to (5,4), but it's occupied.\n\nBut if we move in a way that (5,4) becomes free.\n\nCurrently, (5,4) is occupied by index 3.\n\nAfter some moves, it might be free.\n\nBut it's complicated.\n\nAnother idea: since we have to move, and both choices lead to potential trap, perhaps we can choose one and then immediately go down when possible.\n\nBut from (6,5) or (5,6), we can't go down immediately.\n\nFor example, from (6,5), we moved U to (6,6), then we are stuck.\n\nUnless from (6,5), we could move D, but (6,4) is occupied, so we can't.\n\nSimilarly from (5,6), can't move D.\n\nSo it seems we are forced into a corner.\n\nPerhaps we can move R to (6,5), then at turn 89, we have to move U to (6,6), then at turn 90, from (6,6), we can move L to (5,6), then at turn 91, from (5,6), as before, no moves, but at that point, the snake might have moved, and some cells are free.\n\nIn turn 91 from (5,6), positions: head (5,6), body (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), etc., so (5,5) is occupied, so no move down.\n\n(4,6) wall, (5,7) wall, (6,6) occupied, so no.\n\nBut (5,6) is at y=6, and below is (5,5), occupied.\n\nUnless we can move left, but (4,6) wall.\n\nSo dead end.\n\nSimilarly if we start with U.\n\nSo the only way out is to have a food to eat to change the tail position or something.\n\nBut there is no food near.\n\n(1,1) is far, and life span short.\n\n(1,4) is at (1,4), free.\n\nFrom (5,5), it's 5 moves away.\n\nBut we can't start moving towards it because we are stuck.\n\nPerhaps we can go to (4,3) or (5,3).\n\n(5,3) is free, at (5,3).\n\nHow to get there from (5,5)?\n\nDirectly down to (5,4) is occupied, so not possible.\n\nMove right to (6,5), then down to (6,4) occupied, not possible.\n\nMove up to (5,6), then left or right, not down.\n\nSo no direct way.\n\nWe need to move to (6,5) or (5,6), then to (6,6) or (5,6), then from there, we might go to (6,5) or (5,5), but occupied.\n\nFrom (6,6), we can move to (6,5) if it's free, but when we are at (6,6), (6,5) is usually the previous position, occupied.\n\nIn the sequence, when we move to (6,6), (6,5) is the neck, occupied.\n\nSo we can't move back.\n\nThe only possible move from (6,6) is to (5,6) if available, or (6,5) if available, but both are occupied at that time.\n\nIn the first simulation, when at (6,6), (5,6) is free if we came from (5,6), but in the move to (6,6), (5,6) is still occupied by the body.\n\nFor example, at turn 89, after moving to (6,6), positions have (5,6) as segment 1, so occupied.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) as segment 2.\n\nSo no free adjacent cells.\n\nTherefore, from (5,5), both moves lead to a dead end in 3 turns.\n\nBut we have to choose one for turn 88.\n\nPerhaps for long-term, we can accept that and restart or something, but it's game over.\n\nUnless there is a way to eat food to survive.\n\nFor example, if we can reach (1,4) quickly.\n\nBut from (5,5), we can't.\n\nAnother idea: the food at (2,3) is under the body, but if we move the snake, we might be able to eat it when the head is near.\n\nBut currently head is at (5,5), (2,3) is far.\n\nAfter some moves, if we go towards left.\n\nBut from (5,5), moving U or R takes us right or up.\n\nLet's assume we move R to (6,5) at turn 88.\n\nThen at turn 89, move U to (6,6).\n\nThen at turn 90, move L to (5,6).\n\nThen at turn 91, at (5,6), no moves, collision or wall, so die.\n\nSimilarly if we start with U.\n\nSo we die on turn 91.\n\nBut perhaps at turn 88, we can move U to (5,6), then at turn 89 move R to (6,6), then at turn 90 move D to (6,5) if possible, but at turn 90, from (6,6), (6,5) is free only if not occupied, but in the body.\n\nAfter moving to (6,6) at turn 89, positions: head (6,6), segment 1 (5,6), segment 2 (5,5), etc., so (6,5) is not occupied at that turn? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 88: move U to (5,6), positions: head (5,6), then (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2)  -- tail (4,2)\n\n(6,5) is free at this turn.\n\nAt turn 89, from (5,6), we move R to (6,6), so head to (6,6), then new positions: head (6,6), then (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)  -- tail (3,2)\n\n(6,5) is not occupied; it was free and still free.\n\nAt turn 90, head at (6,6), direction R (since moved right from (5,6) to (6,6)? From (5,6) to (6,6) is right, so direction R.\n\nMoves: U wall, D to (6,5), L to (5,6) collision (segment 1), R wall.\n\nSo D to (6,5) is possible, since (6,5) empty.\n\nMove D to (6,5). Head (6,5), direction D.\n\nPositions: head (6,5), then (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)  -- tail (3,3)\n\nThen from (6,5), we can move U to (6,6) collision, D to (6,4) occupied (segment 7 (6,4)? Index 7 is (6,4), yes, occupied), L to (5,5) occupied, R wall. Only possible moves are U, D, L, R but U collision, D collision, L collision, R wall, so trapped at turn 91.\n\nSame issue.\n\nSo in all cases, by turn 91, we are trapped if we go to the top-right.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid going to (5,6) or (6,5) at all.\n\nBut from (5,5), we have no choice; we must move to one of them.\n\nUnless we can move down, but we can't.\n\nPerhaps the snake can move to a cell that will be free after move, but (5,4) is occupied and not tail.\n\nAnother thought: the tail is at (5,2), and we can move in a way that the tail moves, freeing cells.\n\nFor example, if we move to a free cell, the tail moves, freeing the old tail position.\n\nBut in this case, from (5,5), moving U or R to free cell, tail moves from (5,2) to (4,2) or something, freeing (5,2).\n\nBut that doesn't help immediately.\n\nPerhaps we can go down to (5,4) if it becomes free, but it's not.\n\nI think we are forced to move to (5,6) or (6,5), and then we get trapped.\n\nBut maybe we can eat the food at (2,3) by moving the head there when it's free.\n\nBut it's under body now.\n\nLet's calculate how soon (2,3) can be free.\n\nCurrently at turn 88, (2,3) is index 13.\n\nAfter k moves without eating, the tail moves closer.\n\nAfter 6 moves without eating, index 13 becomes the tail.\n\nAfter 7 moves, it is vacated.\n\nBut during those moves, the head is moving, so if we move the head towards (2,3), we might be able to eat it when free.\n\nBut from (5,5), we are moving away.\n\nFor example, if at turn 88 we move R to (6,5), then at 89 U to (6,6), then at 90 L to (5,6), then at 91 trapped, so we don't have 7 moves.\n\nIf we can survive longer.\n\nBut in 3 moves we are trapped.\n\nSo we need to find a way to survive the immediate turns.\n\nPerhaps there is a food we can reach quickly.\n\n(1,4) is at (1,4), free.\n\nFrom (5,5), min 5 moves: for example, left 4 times and down 1, but we can't move left immediately.\n\nSequence: from (5,5), move U to (5,6), then from (5,6) we can only move R to (6,6), then from (6,6) move L to (5,6) not possible, or D to (6,5) if possible, but as before.\n\nFrom (6,6) at turn 90 in some sequence, we can move D to (6,5), then from (6,5) we can move L to (5,5) but occupied, or U to (6,6) occupied, etc.\n\nNo.\n\nMove to (5,3).\n\n(5,3) is free.\n\nHow to get to (5,3) from (5,5)?\n\nDirectly down to (5,4) occupied.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nMove left to (4,5) but occupied and reverse not allowed.\n\nSo no.\n\nI think the only way is to go to (5,6) or (6,5) and then try to escape to the left when possible, but from there, the only way is down or left, but occupied.\n\nFor example, from (6,6), if we could move to (5,5) but it's far.\n\nNot adjacent.\n\nSo I think we are in a losing position, but we have to make a move.\n\nPerhaps for turn 88, we move R to (6,5), then at turn 89, we have to move U to (6,6), then at turn 90, from (6,6), move D to (6,5) if possible, but in the case where (6,5) is free, like in the second sequence when we moved U then R, at turn 90 from (6,6), (6,5) was free, so we can move D to (6,5).\n\nThen from (6,5), we can move D to (6,4) but occupied, or L to (5,5) occupied, etc., same as before.\n\nAfter moving to (6,5) at turn 90, positions: head (6,5), then (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), etc., so (6,4) is index 7, occupied, so no move down.\n\nSo stuck.\n\nTherefore, it seems impossible to avoid death in a few turns.\n\nBut perhaps we can eat the food at (1,4) by a long path.\n\nBut we can't start.\n\nAnother idea: move to (4,3) or other free cells.\n\n(4,3) is free.\n\nHow to get to (4,3) from (5,5)?\n\nMove left to (4,5) but occupied and reverse not allowed.\n\nMove up to (5,6), then left to (4,6) wall.\n\nMove right to (6,5), then down to (6,4) occupied.\n\nSo no direct path.\n\nI think I have to accept that for turn 88, we move one of them, say R to (6,5), and then the subsequent moves are forced until death.\n\nBut that doesn't maximize score.\n\nPerhaps there is a way to go down later.\n\nLet's list the sequence of forced moves.\n\nTurn 88: from (5,5), must move U or R. Say we move R to (6,5).\n\nTurn 89: from (6,5), only move U to (6,6).\n\nTurn 90: from (6,6), only move L to (5,6) (in some cases) or D to (6,5) if free.\n\nIn the case where we moved R then U, at turn 90, from (6,6), (5,6) is free, so move L to (5,6).\n\nThen turn 91: from (5,6), no moves, die.\n\nIf at turn 88 we move U to (5,6), then turn 89 move R to (6,6), then turn 90 move D to (6,5), then turn 91 from (6,5) no moves, die.\n\nSo in both cases, death on turn 91.\n\nBut on turn 88, (1,1) can be eaten, but it's too far.\n\nLife span 2, so can be eaten on turn 88 or 89, but we are at (5,5), (1,1) is 8 cells away, impossible.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4) is 5 cells away, can be eaten later.\n\nBut we die before.\n\nSo no score.\n\nPerhaps the food at (2,3) can be eaten sooner if we move towards it.\n\nBut with the current path, we are moving away.\n\nFor example, at turn 88, instead of moving U or R, we can't.\n\nI think we have to choose one.\n\nPerhaps for the answer, we can move R on turn 88, then U on 89, then L on 90, then on 91 die, but we need to plan 5 turns, but we only have 3 turns left.\n\nTurn 88, 89, 90, 91.\n\nBut for the answer format, we need to output actions for turn 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, but we may not survive that long.\n\nBut we should output as long as possible.\n\nSince we die on turn 91, we can only output up to turn 90 or 91.\n\nBut let's see the food life span.\n\n(2,3) life span 10, so it will be there, but we can't reach it.\n\nPerhaps we can move in a way to free (2,3) faster.\n\nBut with the snake size, it takes time.\n\nI think for this state, the best is to move R on turn 88 to (6,5), then U on 89 to (6,6), then L on 90 to (5,6), and then on 91 no move, but for the answer, we can output up to where we can.\n\nBut let's confirm if from (5,6) on turn 91, there is a move.\n\nIn positions, head at (5,6), body at (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), etc., so no adjacent free cells, all occupied or wall.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, the snake will die on turn 91.\n\nFor the answer, we can output the moves for turn 88, 89, 90.\n\nTurn 91 no move, so not output.\n\nFor 5 turns ahead, turn 88 to 92, but we can't.\n\nPerhaps at turn 88, we move to (5,6), then at 89 to (6,6), then at 90 to (6,5), then at 91 from (6,5), if we could move to (6,4) but occupied, or to (5,5) occupied, no.\n\nSo same.\n\nI think we have to accept it.\n\nPerhaps there is a mistake in the state.\n\nAnother thought: the head direction is R, but at (5,5), it came from left, since previous position is (4,5), so it moved right to (5,5), so direction R.\n\nBut perhaps we can move down if possible, but (5,4) occupied.\n\nOr the food at (2,3) is under body, but if we move the head to a cell that allows the body to shift.\n\nBut I think it's hopeless.\n\nPerhaps for turn 88, we move U to (5,6), then for turn 89, move R to (6,6), then for turn 90, move D to (6,5), then for turn 91, no move, but at turn 90, after moving to (6,5), the tail has moved, freeing cells, but still no free adjacent cells for head.\n\nPositions at turn 90 after move to (6,5): head (6,5), body (6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)  -- so (6,4) occupied, (5,5) occupied, (7,5) wall, (6,6) occupied, so no move.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think the snake is doomed.\n\nFor the answer, I'll output the moves until we can.\n\nSo for turn 88: move R\n\nTurn 89: move U\n\nTurn 90: move L ( to (5,6) )\n\nThen on turn 91, die.\n\nBut for the format, we need to output actions for 5 turns if possible.\n\nSince we can't, output for 3 turns.\n\nBut the instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but for output, we output the actions for the turns.\n\nPerhaps we can output for turn 88 to 92, but for 91 and 92, we can't, so only up to 90.\n\nLet's assume we move R on 88, U on 89, then on 90 from (6,6), we can move D to (6,5) in some cases, but then on 91 stuck.\n\nBut in the output, we can put the possible actions.\n\nPerhaps for long-term, but we don't have long-term.\n\nAnother idea: the food at (1,4) might be reachable if we go via the top, but we are stuck.\n\nI think I have to give up and output the moves.\n\nSo for turn 88, action: R (right)\n\nTurn 89: U (up)\n\nTurn 90: L (left) to (5,6)\n\nThen stop.\n\nBut for the box, we need to output for turn 88, 89, 90, 91, 92.\n\nBut for 91 and 92, no action, so perhaps only for the turns we can.\n\nOr we can put the actions until death.\n\nBut the format says \"action on turn t\", so for turns where we can move, put action, else not.\n\nBut in this case, for turn 91, no possible action, so we don't output.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut to be safe, let's output for 5 turns if possible.\n\nSince we die on 91, only 3 actions.\n\nPerhaps at turn 90, from (6,6), we can move to (5,6), then on turn 91, from (5,6), if we could move to (5,5) but occupied, no.\n\nUnless the body has moved, but it's occupied.\n\nSo I think it's over.\n\nPerhaps the internal obstacle or something.\n\nAnother thought: the cell (4,3) is free, and (5,3) is free, so if we can reach them.\n\nFrom (5,5), to (5,3), we need to go down, but (5,4) occupied.\n\nIf we move right to (6,5), then down to (6,4) occupied, not possible.\n\nMove up to (5,6), then left to (4,6) wall.\n\nNo.\n\nSo no way.\n\nTherefore, for the answer, I'll output:\n\nTurn 88: R\n\nTurn 89: U\n\nTurn 90: L\n\nAnd for 91 and 92, no, but since the format might expect 5, we can stop at 90.\n\nPerhaps for turn 88, move U instead.\n\nSame thing.\n\nLet's choose U for turn 88.\n\nTurn 88: U to (5,6)\n\nTurn 89: R to (6,6)\n\nTurn 90: D to (6,5)\n\nThen turn 91: from (6,5), no move.\n\nSame.\n\nSo either way.\n\nI think I'll go with R first.\n\nSo for the box:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 88: R\nTurn 89: U\nTurn 90: L\n}\n\nBut this is only 3 turns, and we need to think 5+ ahead, but in this case, we can't.\n\nPerhaps we can include turn 91 and 92, but no action.\n\nSo I think this is it.\n</think>\nThe current state presents a challenging situation where the snake is at high risk of trapping itself in the top-right corner of the grid. After evaluating all possible moves 5+ turns ahead, the priority is to maximize survival and avoid immediate death. However, due to the snake's position and body constraints, all paths lead to a dead end by turn 91. The recommended actions for turns 88-90 are the only safe moves that delay death as long as possible, allowing for potential opportunities if the food at (1,4) or (2,3) could be reached, but the distance and body blockage make this infeasible within the life spans.\n\n### Analysis of Moves:\n- **Turn 88 (current head at (5,5), direction R)**:\n  - Possible moves: U (to (5,6)) or R (to (6,5)). D (to (5,4)) causes collision with body. L is invalid (instant reverse).\n  - Moving R to (6,5) is chosen to avoid the top row longer, but both U and R lead to similar outcomes.\n\n- **Turn 89 (head at (6,5) after R move)**:\n  - Only safe move is U to (6,6) (D causes collision, R and L invalid).\n\n- **Turn 90 (head at (6,6) after U move)**:\n  - Only safe move is L to (5,6) (U, D, R are invalid due to walls or collision).\n\n- **Turn 91 (head at (5,6))**: \n  - All moves invalid: U (wall at (5,7)), D (collision with body at (5,5)), L (wall at (4,6)), R (collision with body at (6,6)). Snake dies.\n\n### Long-term Considerations:\n- **Food Access**: \n  - (1,1) (life span 2) is too far (min 8 moves) and disappears after turn 89; unreachable.\n  - (1,4) (life span 7) is min 5 moves away but the snake moves away from it, making access impossible before death.\n  - (2,3) (life span 10) is under the body and requires 6+ moves to free, but the snake dies before this can happen.\n- **Survival**: The snake's body blocks key escape routes, and moving to (5,6) or (6,6) creates an inescapable trap by turn 91. No sequence avoids this outcome, so the focus is on delaying death with the only available safe moves.\n\n### Action Plan:\nThe moves for turns 88-90 are forced to avoid immediate death. Turn 91 has no valid action, so only three turns are output.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 88: R\nTurn 89: U\nTurn 90: L\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 89, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the borders are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. There's an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nThe snake positions are given as a list: head is at (6,5), and the body follows. The snake has 20 segments? Let me count: positions are from (6,5) to (4,2), that's 20 positions. So the snake is quite long.\n\nThe head direction is R, meaning right, so the snake is moving east.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (1,1) with value 1 and life span 1, so it disappears after this turn if not eaten? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 89, life span is 1, meaning it will disappear after turn 89. Since we're at turn 89, if we eat it this turn, we get it, but after this turn, it's gone.\n\nLife span: it says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So for food at (1,1), life_span=1 at turn 89, so after turn 89, it disappears. That means if we don't eat it on turn 89, it's gone forever.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4) has life span 6, value 1.\n\n(2,3) has life span 9, value 1.\n\nAll food has value 1, so all positive food, no negative food mentioned.\n\nNow, the snake head is at (6,5), moving right. So possible moves: since direction is R, I can go R, U, or D, but not L because of no instant reverse. Current direction R, so cannot go L (left).\n\nPossible actions: R (right to (7,5)?), U (up to (6,6)?), D (down to (6,4)?).\n\nBut need to check walls and collisions.\n\nFirst, walls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So x=7 is a wall, so moving right to (7,5) is impossible because x=7 is a wall.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 and y=7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), but that's not near the head right now.\n\nHead at (6,5).\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Right: to (7,5) but x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n\n- Up: to (6,6), y=6, but y=7 is wall, y=6 is not wall? y from 0 to 7, so y=6 is within bounds, no wall there except borders. Borders are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So (6,6) has x=6, y=6, not border, so it should be free, but need to check if it's occupied by snake body.\n\n(6,6) is not in snake positions: snake is at (6,5), (5,5), etc., no (6,6), so it should be free.\n\n- Down: to (6,4), but (6,4) is part of snake body? Snake positions: (6,5) head, then (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), ... (6,4) is the 6th segment? Positions: index 0: (6,5), 1: (5,5), 2: (4,5), 3: (4,4), 4: (5,4), 5: (6,4), then (6,3), (6,2), etc.\n\n(6,4) is at position 5, which is the body. But when we move, the head moves to a new position, and the tail moves forward, so if head moves to (6,4), which is currently occupied by the body, but since it's the tail that will move, it might be okay? But collision rules: head touches any body segment except that if it moves into the tail cell, it might be okay because the tail moves.\n\nLet's read carefully: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, moving to the tail cell is safe because the tail moves away, so no collision.\n\nIn this case, (6,4) is not the tail; the tail is at (4,2). (6,4) is a body segment, not the tail.\n\nList of positions: head (6,5), then (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2) tail.\n\nSo (6,4) is the 5th segment, which is body, not tail. If head moves to (6,4), it would collide with the body segment there, since that cell is occupied and not the tail.\n\nThe tail is at (4,2), so only moving to (4,2) might be safe if we eat food or something, but not to other body cells.\n\nRule: \"head touches any body segment\" is deadly, except for the tail cell when it moves.\n\nSpecifically: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo for (6,4), it is not the tail, so moving there would cause collision.\n\nTherefore, for head at (6,5), moving down to (6,4) is invalid because collision with body.\n\nSimilarly, moving right to (7,5) is wall, invalid.\n\nMoving up to (6,6): is (6,6) occupied? Snake positions: all listed, no (6,6), so it should be free. Also, not wall. So up to (6,6) is possible.\n\nBut current direction is R, so moving U or D is allowed, since not reverse.\n\nNo reverse only applies to opposite direction; U and D are perpendicular, so okay.\n\nSo possible moves from (6,5): only U to (6,6), since R is wall, D is body collision.\n\nL is left to (5,5), but (5,5) is the first body segment right after head.\n\nIf head moves left to (5,5), that would be moving into the body cell at (5,5), which is not tail, so collision.\n\nPositions: head (6,5), next is (5,5), so (5,5) is adjacent and occupied by body.\n\nSo moving left to (5,5) would cause immediate collision.\n\nTherefore, from current position, only possible move is Up to (6,6).\n\nBut is that safe? (6,6) is free, no wall, no food there, I think.\n\nFood positions: (1,1), (1,4), (2,3). None at (6,6).\n\nSo moving to (6,6) should be fine.\n\nBut we need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nThe food at (1,1) has life span 1, meaning it disappears after this turn. So if we don't eat it now, it's gone.\n\nBut can we eat it this turn? Head is at (6,5), (1,1) is far away, no way to reach in one turn. So impossible to eat (1,1) this turn; it will disappear after turn 89, so we lose it.\n\nSimilarly, other food: (1,4) life span 6, so disappears after turn 89+5=94? Life span decreases every turn including current.\n\nAt turn 89, life span=1 for (1,1), so after turn 89, gone.\n\nFor (1,4), life span=6 at turn 89, so it will be there for 6 more turns, including turn 89, so from turn 89 to 94, and disappears after turn 94.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) life span=9, so from turn 89 to 97, disappears after turn 97.\n\nNow, snake head at (6,5), moving to (6,6) is one option, but let's see the board.\n\nI should sketch the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions: let's list them to visualize.\n\nHead: (6,5)\n\nBody: (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2) tail.\n\nNow, food at (1,1), (1,4), (2,3).\n\n(2,3) is a food position, but (2,3) is also part of snake body? Snake positions include (2,3)? Let's see: positions: ... (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), ...\n\nYes, (2,3) is a body segment.\n\nBut food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nRule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nAlso, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, food at (2,3), and (2,3) is occupied by snake body. So to eat it, the snake must move so that the body segment at (2,3) moves away, then head can move to (2,3) to eat the food.\n\nCurrently, the body segment at (2,3) is not the tail; tail is at (4,2).\n\nSimilarly, food at (1,1): (1,1) is not in snake positions? Snake has (2,1), (3,1), etc., but not (1,1). (1,1) is free? x=1,y=1, borders are walls, so (1,1) should be accessible unless wall.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 walls, so (1,1) is inside, not wall. Snake positions: from list, (2,1) is there, but not (1,1), so (1,1) is free and has food.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4): not in snake positions, so free with food.\n\n(2,3) has food but occupied by body, so not accessible until body moves.\n\nBack to current move.\n\nAt turn 89, head at (6,5), only possible move is Up to (6,6), since R is wall, D is body, L is body.\n\nAfter moving to (6,6), new head position (6,6), direction U.\n\nThen snake positions: head (6,6), then (6,5), (5,5), ..., and tail moves forward, so the last segment (4,2) is removed, new positions: head (6,6), then previous head (6,5) becomes neck, then (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), and tail was (4,2), but since we moved, the segment at (4,2) is removed, so the new tail is (3,2)? Let's trace.\n\nOriginal positions: 0:(6,5), 1:(5,5), 2:(4,5), 3:(4,4), 4:(5,4), 5:(6,4), 6:(6,3), 7:(6,2), 8:(6,1), 9:(5,1), 10:(4,1), 11:(3,1), 12:(2,1), 13:(2,2), 14:(2,3), 15:(2,4), 16:(3,4), 17:(3,3), 18:(3,2), 19:(4,2)  // 20 segments.\n\nAfter move U to (6,6): new head (6,6), then the body: segment 0 moves to new position, so the new segment 0 is (6,6), segment 1 is old segment 0 (6,5), segment 2 is old segment 1 (5,5), ..., up to segment 19 is old segment 18 (3,2), and old segment 19 (4,2) is removed. So new tail is (3,2).\n\nAnd we didn't eat food, so length same, 20 segments.\n\nNow, at turn 90, head at (6,6), direction U (since we moved up).\n\nPossible moves: U, L, R, but not D (reverse).\n\nCurrent direction U, so cannot move D.\n\nPossible: U to (6,7), but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n\nL to (5,6)\n\nR to (7,6), but x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move L to (5,6).\n\nIs (5,6) free? Not in snake positions, and not wall. Internal obstacle at (4,6), not (5,6). So yes.\n\nSo move L to (5,6).\n\nThen turn 90: head to (5,6), direction L (since we moved left).\n\nSnake positions: head (5,6), then (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), ... and tail moves to (2,3)? Old tail was (3,2), removed, new tail is (2,3)? Let's see.\n\nAfter turn 89: positions: head (6,6), then (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)  // 20 segments, tail (3,2)\n\nAfter move to (5,6) at turn 90: new head (5,6), then (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)  // tail (3,3)\n\nNow, at turn 91, head at (5,6), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: L, U, D, but not R (reverse).\n\nL to (4,6): but (4,6) is internal obstacle, wall, so invalid.\n\nU to (5,7), y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nD to (5,5): (5,5) is body segment? Current positions: (5,5) is part of body, it's the third segment after head? Head (5,6), then (6,6), then (6,5), then (5,5) is next? Positions: 0:(5,6), 1:(6,6), 2:(6,5), 3:(5,5), ... so (5,5) is segment 3, body, not tail.\n\nMoving to (5,5) would be collision.\n\nD to (5,5) is down, which is possible direction, but (5,5) occupied by body, so collision.\n\nWhat about other moves? Only L, U, D possible, all invalid: L to wall, U to wall, D to body.\n\nStuck? But that can't be right.\n\nPerhaps I missed something.\n\nAt (5,6), possible moves:\n\n- Left to (4,6): wall, invalid\n\n- Up to (5,7): wall, invalid\n\n- Down to (5,5): body, invalid\n\nNo other moves? Right is reverse, not allowed since current direction L, right would be opposite.\n\nSo no valid moves? But that means death, which is bad.\n\nBut we need to avoid this.\n\nIn the first move, at turn 89, moving up to (6,6) led to a dead end at turn 91.\n\nSo we need to think ahead.\n\nBut at turn 89, moving up was the only choice? Earlier I thought only U possible, but let's double-check.\n\nTurn 89, head (6,5), direction R.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Right to (7,5): x=7 wall, invalid\n\n- Left to (5,5): (5,5) is body segment, immediately after head, so moving left to (5,5) would be collision, since it's occupied and not tail.\n\n- Up to (6,6): free, as we thought\n\n- Down to (6,4): (6,4) is body segment, position 5 in list, not tail, so collision.\n\nSo indeed, only up is possible at turn 89.\n\nBut that leads to trap later.\n\nUnless... is there food or something?\n\nPerhaps the snake can move in a way to free up space.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (2,3) is under the body, so when the body moves away, it can be eaten.\n\nBut currently, head is far.\n\nAt turn 89, if we move up to (6,6), then turn 90 to (5,6), then at turn 91, no move, but we have to choose, but all invalid, so snake dies.\n\nBut that can't be the case; I must have missed a move.\n\nAt turn 90, after moving to (5,6), direction L, but at turn 90, when we move to (5,6), the direction is L, so for turn 91, from (5,6), direction L, we can move U, D, or L, but L to (4,6) wall, U to (5,7) wall, D to (5,5) body, all invalid.\n\nBut is there a way to avoid this?\n\nPerhaps at turn 89, we can do something else, but only one move.\n\nUnless the head direction allows for other interpretations, but no.\n\nAnother idea: when we move, the tail moves, so some cells become free.\n\nBut in this case, at (5,6), moving down to (5,5) is occupied, but (5,5) is not the tail; tail is at (3,3) at that point, far away.\n\nSo collision.\n\nPerhaps we can consider the food at (2,3). If we can get the head there when the body moves away.\n\nBut currently, it's not possible in few turns.\n\nLet's list all possible paths from current state.\n\nAt turn 89, only move is U to (6,6).\n\nThen turn 90, from (6,6), direction U, we moved L to (5,6), which is the only choice, since U wall, R wall.\n\nThen at turn 91, stuck.\n\nBut that means the snake will die at turn 91, which is bad for long-term survival.\n\nBut we need to maximize score, so perhaps we can eat food before dying.\n\nBut at turn 89 and 90, no food eaten.\n\nFood at (1,1) is gone after this turn.\n\n(1,4) is at (1,4), which is free.\n\n(2,3) is under body.\n\nSo we can't eat anything soon.\n\nPerhaps there is a mistake in the snake positions.\n\nLet me plot the grid.\n\nMake a grid:\n\ny=7: . . . . . . . .   x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\ny=6: . . . . . . . .   but internal obstacle at (4,6), so (4,6) is wall.\n\nBorders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 walls.\n\nSo for y=6: cells (0,6) wall, (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6) wall, (5,6), (6,6), (7,6) wall.\n\nSimilarly, y=5: (0,5) wall, (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,5) wall.\n\nSnake at turn 89:\n\nHead: (6,5)\n\nBody: (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2)\n\nFood: (1,1), (1,4), (2,3) but (2,3) occupied.\n\nFrom (6,5), only move to (6,6).\n\n(6,6) is free.\n\nAfter move to (6,6), head at (6,6), body: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)  tail at (3,2)\n\nAt turn 90, head (6,6), direction U, can move U, L, R.\n\nU to (6,7) wall.\n\nR to (7,6) wall.\n\nL to (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is free, not wall, not snake.\n\nMove to (5,6).\n\nNew head (5,6), direction L.\n\nBody: (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)  tail at (3,3)\n\nAt turn 91, head (5,6), direction L.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nL to (4,6): but (4,6) is internal obstacle, wall.\n\nU to (5,7): y=7 wall.\n\nD to (5,5): (5,5) is body segment, position 2 in body? Head (5,6), then (6,6), then (6,5), then (5,5) is next, so (5,5) is occupied by body, not tail.\n\nMoving to (5,5) would be collision.\n\nR is reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo no valid moves, snake dies at turn 91.\n\nBut this is a problem.\n\nPerhaps at turn 90, from (6,6), we could move to other directions, but only L is possible.\n\nUnless we can move down, but current direction U, moving D is reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo only L to (5,6).\n\nSo it seems the snake is trapped.\n\nBut the state is given, so there must be a way.\n\nAnother thought: when we move, the tail moves, so at turn 90, when we move to (5,6), the tail moves from (3,2) to? After move, tail is at (3,3), as above.\n\nBut (5,5) is still occupied.\n\nPerhaps the head can move to a cell that will be free, but at turn 91, (5,5) is occupied and not freeing soon.\n\nLet's see the body positions: from head (5,6), body (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), ... so (5,5) is fixed for now.\n\nUnless we can move in a way that the body shifts.\n\nBut at (5,6), no choice but to move to (5,5) if possible, but it's occupied.\n\nSo the only way is if (5,5) was the tail, but it's not.\n\nTail is at (3,3), far away.\n\nSo it seems like a dead end.\n\nPerhaps at turn 89, we can consider the food, but no.\n\nAnother idea: the food at (2,3) is under the body, and if we move the snake, the body at (2,3) will move at some point.\n\nFor example, the segment at (2,3) will move when the snake moves.\n\nAt turn 89, after moving up, the body at (2,3) is still there.\n\nAt turn 90, when we move to (5,6), the body shifts, so the cell (2,3) is still occupied by the snake, but the food is there, so when the body moves away from (2,3), the food can be eaten.\n\nBut at turn 91, we are stuck at (5,6).\n\nSo we need to avoid getting stuck.\n\nBut at turn 89, we have no choice.\n\nUnless... is there a way to move down or left at turn 89? But both are occupied or wall.\n\nDown to (6,4): (6,4) is body, position 5, not tail.\n\nLeft to (5,5): body position 1, not tail.\n\nRight wall.\n\nUp only.\n\nPerhaps the head direction can be used to allow moves, but no, the direction is given as R, and we choose action.\n\nMaybe we can move in a direction that is not reverse, but all other are blocked.\n\nSo it seems inevitable that we get stuck at turn 91.\n\nBut that can't be right for the problem; perhaps I misread the snake positions.\n\nLet's list the positions again: \"Snake Positions\":[(6, 5), (5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2), (4, 2)]\n\nAfter (3,2) is (4,2), tail.\n\nNow, when we move, the head moves, tail moves.\n\nAt turn 89, move U to (6,6), new positions: head (6,6), then (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)  // (4,2) removed, tail (3,2)\n\n(4,2) is removed, so (3,2) is new tail.\n\nAt turn 90, from (6,6) direction U, move L to (5,6), new positions: head (5,6), then (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)  // (3,2) removed, tail (3,3)\n\nAt turn 91, head (5,6), direction L, move to (4,6) wall, or (5,7) wall, or (5,5) body.\n\n(5,5) is occupied by the third body segment.\n\nIf we could move to (5,5), but it's occupied, so collision.\n\nUnless (5,5) is the tail, but it's not; tail is at (3,3).\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps at turn 90, from (6,6), we can move down, but current direction U, moving D is reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo the only way is to have moved differently earlier, but at turn 89, no choice.\n\nPerhaps the food can be eaten, but not here.\n\nAnother possibility: the internal obstacle at (4,6) is a wall, so (4,6) is blocked.\n\nBut (5,6) is free, but we are stuck after.\n\nPerhaps the snake can go towards the food.\n\nFor example, at turn 89, if we could move left, but we can't because (5,5) is occupied.\n\nUnless the no instant reverse allows perpendicular moves, but moving left from right direction is perpendicular? Current direction R, moving L is left, which is opposite to R, so it is reverse.\n\n\" No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nCurrent direction R, opposite is L, so cannot move L.\n\nSimilarly, U and D are perpendicular, allowed.\n\nSo at (6,5), R wall, L not allowed, U free, D body, so only U.\n\nSo we must move U.\n\nThen at (6,6), U wall, R wall, L free, so move L to (5,6).\n\nThen at (5,6), L wall, U wall, D body, so no move.\n\nSo the snake dies at turn 91.\n\nBut for the sake of the problem, perhaps we have to accept that and move, but we need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe answer format is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nBut if we die at turn 91, we can only output two actions.\n\nTurn 89: U\n\nTurn 90: L\n\nThen at turn 91, no valid action, so snake dies.\n\nBut that seems poor for long-term survival.\n\nPerhaps there is a way to eat food to change the tail position.\n\nFor example, if we eat food, the snake grows, so tail doesn't move, and we might have more space.\n\nBut currently, no food near.\n\nAt turn 89, no food at (6,6), so no growth.\n\nSimilarly at turn 90, no food at (5,6).\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps the food at (2,3) can be eaten later, but we don't reach there.\n\nAnother idea: maybe at turn 89, we can consider that moving down is possible if (6,4) is the tail, but it's not; tail is at (4,2).\n\nIn the list, (6,4) is position 5, not tail.\n\nBut let's see the tail position: tail is (4,2), which is not adjacent to head.\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills.\n\nBut here, tail at (4,2), head at (6,5), not adjacent.\n\nSo not relevant.\n\nPerhaps for the move to (6,4), if it were the tail, but it's not.\n\nI think I have to accept that at turn 91, we die.\n\nBut let's check the life span of food.\n\nFood at (1,1) life span 1, so after turn 89 gone.\n\n(1,4) life span 6, so available until turn 94.\n\n(2,3) life span 9, until turn 97.\n\nBut with snake dying at turn 91, we can't eat them.\n\nPerhaps there is a mistake in the state.\n\nAnother thought: the internal obstacle at (4,6) is given, but is (5,6) free? Yes.\n\nBut when we are at (5,6), we can only move to (5,5) if it were free, but it's not.\n\nUnless at some point it becomes free, but not soon.\n\nPerhaps the snake can be moved to go down earlier.\n\nBut at turn 89, we can't move down.\n\nLet's list all cells.\n\nI think I have to proceed with the only move.\n\nSo for turn 89: action U\n\nThen turn 90: action L\n\nThen at turn 91, no action, but we need to output.\n\nPerhaps for turn 91, we can choose an action, but all invalid, so snake dies.\n\nBut in the answer, we can output the actions until death.\n\nBut the instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead, but here we can't.\n\nPerhaps from the beginning, we can see if there is a way to avoid.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 89, when we move U to (6,6), the direction is U, then at turn 90, from (6,6), direction U, we can move U, L, R, but U and R wall, so L to (5,6).\n\nBut at (6,6), after moving U, the direction is U, so for next move, we can choose.\n\nBut no other choice.\n\nPerhaps the head can move to a cell that is not wall or body, but only (5,6).\n\nSo I think we have to go with that.\n\nThen for turn 91, since no valid move, we can't output an action, so perhaps only two actions.\n\nBut the answer format requires actions for multiple turns, so maybe we output what we can.\n\nBut let's see if there is a way to survive.\n\nPerhaps the food at (2,3) is under body, and when the body moves, it can be eaten, but we are far away.\n\nFor example, the body at (2,3) will move when the snake moves.\n\nAt turn 89, after move, the body shifts, but (2,3) is still occupied by the next segment or something.\n\nAt turn 89, after move U, positions: head (6,6), then (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)  so (2,3) is still occupied by the body segment that was at (2,3) before, but now it's the 15th segment or something.\n\nAs the snake moves, each body segment moves to the next position.\n\nThe segment at (2,3) at turn 89 will move to the position of the previous segment when the snake moves.\n\nAt turn 89, before move, position 14 is (2,3).\n\nAfter move U, the head moves to (6,6), and each body segment moves to the position of the previous index, so position 1 moves to old position 0, etc., so the segment that was at (2,3) old index 14 moves to old index 13 position, which was (2,2), so at turn 89 after move, (2,2) is occupied by the segment that was at (2,3), but the food is at (2,3), so when the segment moves away, (2,3) is free with food, but the head is not there to eat it.\n\nAt turn 90, when we move to (5,6), the body shifts, so the segment that was at (2,2) moves to (2,1) or something, but (2,3) is now free with food.\n\nLet's see:\n\nAt turn 89 after move: positions: 0:(6,6), 1:(6,5), 2:(5,5), 3:(4,5), 4:(4,4), 5:(5,4), 6:(6,4), 7:(6,3), 8:(6,2), 9:(6,1), 10:(5,1), 11:(4,1), 12:(3,1), 13:(2,1), 14:(2,2), 15:(2,3)?

So only (6,6) free.\n\nAt turn 90, head (6,6): adjacent cells: (6,7) wall, (7,6) wall, (5,6) free, (6,5) body. So only (5,6) free.\n\nAt turn 91, head (5,6): adjacent cells: (5,7) wall, (4,6) wall, (6,6) body, (5,5) body. So all adjacent are wall or body, no free cell, so no move.\n\nSo indeed, death at turn 91.\n\nSo for the answer, we can output:\n\nTurn 89: U\n\nTurn 90: L\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nBut to maximize score, we didn't eat any food, so score 0.\n\nBut with death, score is low.\n\nPerhaps at turn 89, we can consider the life span, but no.\n\nAnother idea: the food at (2,3) has value 1, but it's under body, so if we can get there when it's free.\n\nBut with current path, we can't.\n\nSo I think we have to go with this.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 89: U (up)\n\nTurn 90: L (left)\n\nThen game over.\n\nFor the answer format, we output only these two.\n\nBut the format says \"Turn t1: action ... Turn t1+1: action ... \" so we can do that.\n\nPerhaps for turn 91, we can say no action, but I think we stop when no valid move.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nGiven the current state at turn 89, the snake must prioritize long-term survival and maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding collisions. After analyzing the grid, snake positions, and food, the only immediate safe move at turn 89 is Up (U) to (6,6), as other moves lead to walls or body collisions. However, this path leads to an unavoidable dead end at turn 91 due to the snake's position and surrounding walls/body segments. No food can be eaten in the short term, as the food at (1,1) disappears after this turn and is unreachable, while other food is either under the body or too distant.\n\n### Key Reasoning:\n- **Turn 89 (current turn)**: \n  - Snake head is at (6,5) with direction R.\n  - Possible moves:\n    - Right (R) to (7,5): Invalid (wall at x=7).\n    - Left (L) to (5,5): Invalid (collision with body segment; not tail).\n    - Down (D) to (6,4): Invalid (collision with body segment; not tail).\n    - Up (U) to (6,6): Valid (free cell, no wall or body).\n  - Food at (1,1) has life span 1 and disappears after this turn but is unreachable. Other food is not accessible this turn.\n  - Action: U (Up) to (6,6). No food eaten; length unchanged.\n\n- **Turn 90**:\n  - Snake head now at (6,6) with direction U.\n  - Possible moves:\n    - Up (U) to (6,7): Invalid (wall at y=7).\n    - Right (R) to (7,6): Invalid (wall at x=7).\n    - Down (D): Invalid (reverse direction not allowed).\n    - Left (L) to (5,6): Valid (free cell, no wall or body).\n  - Action: L (Left) to (5,6). No food eaten; length unchanged.\n\n- **Turn 91**:\n  - Snake head at (5,6) with direction L.\n  - Possible moves:\n    - Left (L) to (4,6): Invalid (internal wall at (4,6)).\n    - Up (U) to (5,7): Invalid (wall at y=7).\n    - Down (D) to (5,5): Invalid (collision with body segment; not tail).\n    - Right (R): Invalid (reverse direction not allowed).\n  - No valid moves; snake dies due to no safe cell.\n\nSince the snake cannot survive beyond turn 91, no further actions are possible. The output includes only the valid actions for turns 89 and 90.\n\n### Food and Risk Analysis:\n- **Food at (1,1)**: Disappears after turn 89; unreachable and ignored.\n- **Food at (1,4)**: Life span 6 (available until turn 94); too distant to reach safely before death.\n- **Food at (2,3)**: Under snake body; cannot be eaten until body moves away, but snake dies before this can happen.\n- **Long-term survival**: Not possible due to the trapped position; no path to food or open space within 5+ turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 89: U\nTurn 90: L\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 90, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the borders. There's also an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nThe snake positions are given as a list: head is at (6,6), then (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2). That's 20 segments. Let me plot this mentally.\n\nHead at (6,6), direction is Up, which makes sense because from (6,6) to (6,5) is down? No: if direction is Up, that means the head is moving upwards, so from previous position to current head. The positions are given with head first, so (6,6) is head, then next is (6,5), which is below it, so if head moved to (6,6) from (6,5) or something? Let's think about movement.\n\nThe head direction is given as \"U\", meaning it's currently facing Up. So on the next move, it can go Up, Left, or Right, but not Down since that would be instant reverse. Current head is at (6,6), and the segment behind it is (6,5), which is directly below, so the snake is moving upwards to (6,6) from (6,5)? Positions: index 0: (6,6) head, index 1: (6,5), so the head moved to (6,6) from (6,5), and since it's at (6,6) with direction U, that means it was moving up to get there. So from (6,5) to (6,6) is up, yes.\n\nNow, food: there are two food items:\n\n- (1,4) with value 1 and life span 6\n\n- (2,3) with value 1 and life span 8\n\nBoth are positive food since value is 1.\n\nLife span: for (1,4), life span 6 means it disappears after 6 turns including this one, so if not eaten by turn 95, it's gone. Similarly, (2,3) disappears after 8 turns, by turn 97.\n\nCurrent turn is 90.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's understand the grid layout.\n\nWalls: borders x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. Also internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (6,6)\n\nBody: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)\n\nList all positions to visualize:\n\n- (6,6) - head\n\n- (6,5)\n\n- (5,5)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (4,4)\n\n- (5,4)\n\n- (6,4)\n\n- (6,3)\n\n- (6,2)\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (5,1)\n\n- (4,1)\n\n- (3,1)\n\n- (2,1)\n\n- (2,2)\n\n- (2,3)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (3,2) - tail\n\nTail is at (3,2).\n\nNow, the grid is 8x8, so coordinates from (0,0) to (7,7).\n\nFood at (1,4) and (2,3).\n\n(2,3) is a body segment? Let's see: positions include (2,3), which is index 15 in the list? Positions: index 0: (6,6), 1: (6,5), 2: (5,5), 3: (4,5), 4: (4,4), 5: (5,4), 6: (6,4), 7: (6,3), 8: (6,2), 9: (6,1), 10: (5,1), 11: (4,1), 12: (3,1), 13: (2,1), 14: (2,2), 15: (2,3), 16: (2,4), 17: (3,4), 18: (3,3), 19: (3,2)\n\nSo (2,3) is occupied by the snake body, segment at index 15.\n\nBut food is at (2,3) with value 1 and life span 8.\n\nAccording to the rules, food can spawn under the snake's body, but it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then the head moves onto it.\n\nCurrently, (2,3) is occupied by the snake, so the food there can't be eaten yet. The snake needs to move so that this cell is vacated, then later the head can move onto it.\n\nSimilarly, food at (1,4), which is not occupied by snake? Let's check positions: (1,4) is not in the snake positions list. Snake has (2,4) at index 16, (3,4) at 17, etc., but not (1,4). So (1,4) is free, I think.\n\nGrid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\n(1,4): x=1, y=4. Not in snake positions, and not a wall, so it should be accessible, but only if the snake can reach it.\n\nInternal obstacle at (4,6), which is a wall cell.\n\nHead is at (6,6), direction Up.\n\nPossible moves from (6,6): since direction is U, I can move U, L, or R. Not D, because that would be reverse.\n\nCurrent head position: (6,6)\n\nMove Up: to (6,7), but y=7 is a wall, so I can't move there. y=7 is border wall.\n\nMove Down: but I can't because instant reverse from U to D is not allowed.\n\nMove Left: to (5,6)\n\nMove Right: to (7,6), but x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n\nx=7 is border, so (7,6) is wall, can't move there.\n\nSo from (6,6), possible moves: Left to (5,6) or Down? But Down is reverse, not allowed. Directions: U, D, L, R.\n\nHead direction is U, meaning last move was up, so I can only turn left or right, or continue up. But up is wall, so not possible.\n\nAvailable moves: since moving up is invalid (wall), moving down is invalid (reverse), so only left or right.\n\nLeft: to (5,6)\n\nRight: to (7,6) but x=7 wall, so only possible move is Left to (5,6)? Is (5,6) occupied?\n\n(5,6): is it part of snake or wall?\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7 and internal (4,6).\n\n(5,6) is not a wall, and not in snake positions? Snake positions: all listed, no (5,6), so it should be free.\n\nBut let's confirm: snake has (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), etc., no (5,6). So (5,6) is empty.\n\nInternal obstacle is (4,6), not (5,6).\n\nSo moving Left to (5,6) is possible.\n\nBut direction: when I move, the head direction will change.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead.\n\nFirst, what about the food?\n\nFood at (1,4): value 1, life span 6, so disappears after turn 95 (since current turn 90, 90+6=96, but life span decreases including current turn, so if not eaten by turn 95, gone on turn 96? Let's clarify life span.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for food at turn t with life span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it is present from turn t to t + L - 1, and gone on turn t + L.\n\nCurrent turn t=90.\n\nFood (1,4) life span 6: present on turns 90,91,92,93,94,95. Gone on turn 96.\n\nSimilarly, food (2,3) life span 8: present on turns 90 to 97, gone on 98.\n\nBut (2,3) is currently occupied by snake body, so can't be eaten until vacated.\n\nNow, to eat (2,3), the snake needs to move so that the segment at (2,3) moves away, then head can come back, but it might take time.\n\nAlso, there's a risk: \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nTail is at (3,2), and it has no food, I think. Food is at (2,3) and (1,4), not on tail.\n\n(2,3) has food, but it's not tail; tail is (3,2).\n\nSo no immediate danger.\n\nNow, back to current move.\n\nFrom (6,6), only possible move is Left to (5,6), since Up and Right are walls, Down is reverse.\n\nIs that right? Head at (6,6), direction U.\n\nMove Up: (6,7) wall, invalid.\n\nMove Down: to (6,5), but (6,5) is the body segment right behind head. If I move down, head goes to (6,5), which is occupied by body, so collision.\n\nPositions: head at (6,6), next segment at (6,5), so if I move down to (6,5), it's the same cell as the body, so immediate collision, death.\n\nSimilarly, moving left to (5,6) should be fine, as (5,6) is empty.\n\nMoving right to (7,6) is wall.\n\nSo only valid move is Left to (5,6).\n\nBut is (5,6) safe? Yes, empty.\n\nAfter moving to (5,6), the snake will have new head at (5,6), and the tail will move forward, so the segment at (3,2) will be removed, and a new segment added at head, but since we didn't eat, length same.\n\nWhen we move, if we don't eat, tail moves, head moves to new position.\n\nIn this case, moving to (5,6) which has no food, so snake moves: head to (5,6), body: the previous head (6,6) becomes new body, so positions: new head (5,6), then (6,6), then (6,5), (5,5), and so on, up to (3,2), but tail (3,2) moves off? When snake moves without eating, the tail segment is removed, so the new positions: head (5,6), then the previous head (6,6) is now the first body segment, then (6,5), (5,5), ..., and the last segment (3,2) is removed, so tail is now (2,1) or something.\n\nLet's list the positions after moving left to (5,6):\n\nCurrent positions: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)]\n\nAfter move: head moves to (5,6), so new head: (5,6)\n\nThen the body: the old head (6,6) becomes new neck, then the rest of body except the tail is kept, tail is removed.\n\nSo new positions: [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)] and tail (3,2) is gone.\n\nNew tail is (3,3).\n\nNow, direction: since I moved left, new head direction is L (left).\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nFirst, on this turn, I must move to (5,6), no choice.\n\nBut let's confirm: are there other options? No, only left is possible.\n\nSo for turn 90, action must be L (left).\n\nNow, after that, head at (5,6), direction L.\n\nPossible next moves: from (5,6), direction L, so I can move L, U, or D. Not R (reverse).\n\nMove Left: to (4,6)\n\nBut (4,6) is an internal obstacle, wall, so cannot move there.\n\nMove Up: to (5,7), but y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nMove Down: to (5,5)\n\n(5,5) is currently a body segment? In current positions, (5,5) is index 2, but after move, positions: head (5,6), then (6,6), then (6,5), then (5,5), so (5,5) is a body segment.\n\nAfter move to (5,6), the positions include (5,5) as the fourth segment? New positions: index 0: (5,6) head, index 1: (6,6), index 2: (6,5), index 3: (5,5), etc.\n\nSo (5,5) is occupied.\n\nIf I move down to (5,5), it would be collision with body.\n\nSimilarly, move right: but cannot, because reverse from L to R not allowed.\n\nAvailable moves from (5,6):\n\n- Left to (4,6): wall, invalid\n\n- Up to (5,7): wall, invalid\n\n- Down to (5,5): body, collision\n\n- Right to (6,6): but (6,6) is now occupied by body? After move, (6,6) is the first body segment, so moving to (6,6) would be collision.\n\nAnd also, moving right is reverse direction? Current head direction is L (left), so moving right would be opposite, which is not allowed.\n\nSo from (5,6), after moving there, direction L.\n\nMoves:\n\n- Left: to (4,6) wall, invalid\n\n- Up: to (5,7) wall, invalid\n\n- Down: to (5,5) body, collision\n\n- Right: to (6,6) body, and also reverse direction, not allowed.\n\nBut (6,6) is adjacent and occupied, but even if not, reverse is not allowed.\n\nSo no valid moves? That can't be right.\n\nBut on turn 90, I moved to (5,6), and now stuck.\n\nBut that means death on next turn.\n\nBut the snake must have a way to survive.\n\nPerhaps I missed something.\n\nAnother possibility: on turn 90, from (6,6), is there another move?\n\nEarlier I thought only left to (5,6) is possible, but let's double-check.\n\nHead at (6,6), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R with constraints.\n\nU: (6,7) wall, invalid.\n\nD: to (6,5) but (6,5) is body, collision, and also reverse direction not allowed? Reverse from U to D is not allowed, so D is invalid for two reasons.\n\nL: to (5,6) empty, possible.\n\nR: to (7,6) wall, invalid.\n\nSo only L to (5,6).\n\nThen at (5,6), direction now L.\n\nFrom there:\n\nMove L to (4,6) wall, invalid.\n\nMove U to (5,7) wall, invalid.\n\nMove D to (5,5) body, collision.\n\nMove R to (6,6) body, collision, and reverse not allowed.\n\nSo indeed, no valid moves, snake dies.\n\nBut that can't be the case; there must be a mistake.\n\nPerhaps the internal obstacle (4,6) is not a wall? No, it says \"Cells occupied by walls\" include internal obstacles.\n\n\"Internal Obstacles: [(4,6)]\" so (4,6) is wall.\n\nGrid: (5,6) to (4,6) left, wall.\n\nUp (5,7) wall.\n\nDown (5,5) is body.\n\nRight (6,6) is body.\n\nAnd no other directions.\n\nSo snake is trapped after moving to (5,6).\n\nBut on turn 90, I have to move, so I move to (5,6), then on turn 91, I have no move, so I die.\n\nBut that seems odd. Perhaps I misread the positions.\n\nLet's list the positions again.\n\nSnake positions: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)]\n\nSo the snake is coiled around.\n\nFrom (6,6), moving to (5,6) is to the left, which is empty.\n\nAfter move, head at (5,6), body: (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), etc.\n\n(5,5) is at position after (6,5), so when at (5,6), moving down to (5,5) is directly below, which is occupied by the third body segment (since head (5,6), neck (6,6), then (6,5), then (5,5), so (5,5) is the fourth position, but it's adjacent, so moving to it causes collision.\n\nSimilarly, moving right to (6,6) is the neck, also collision.\n\nSo yes, stuck.\n\nBut perhaps on turn 90, I can move down? But I can't, because it's reverse and also body collision.\n\nUnless the rules allow moving to the tail cell, but here (6,5) is not tail, it's the second segment.\n\nTail is (3,2), far away.\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nBut only if it's the tail, not other body parts.\n\nHere, (6,5) is not tail; tail is (3,2).\n\nSo moving to (6,5) is collision.\n\nSimilarly, for down move.\n\nSo only choice is left to (5,6).\n\nThen at (5,6), the only adjacent cells are all invalid, so death.\n\nBut that can't be right for the game; perhaps I need to consider that after moving, the tail moves, so some cells become free, but in this case, from (5,6), the adjacent cells are (4,6) wall, (5,7) wall, (5,5) occupied, (6,6) occupied, all blocked.\n\nSo the snake has no escape; it's in a dead end.\n\nBut why is the food at (2,3) under the body? Maybe the snake can move to free it.\n\nBut in this position, from (6,6), only move to (5,6), then stuck.\n\nPerhaps the head direction allows something else.\n\nHead direction is U, but after moving left, it changes.\n\nBut on turn 90, I have to move, so I must choose L.\n\nThen for turn 91, no move, so the game ends.\n\nBut that seems harsh.\n\nPerhaps the internal obstacle is not blocking (4,6), but it is.\n\nAnother idea: the food at (2,3) is on a body segment, so if the snake moves, that segment might move away.\n\nBut for the head at (6,6), moving to (5,6) doesn't help immediately.\n\nLet's think about the grid layout.\n\nLet me sketch a grid.\n\nGrid 8x8, walls on borders.\n\nInternal wall at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- Head (6,6)\n\n- (6,5)\n\n- (5,5)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (4,4)\n\n- (5,4)\n\n- (6,4)\n\n- (6,3)\n\n- (6,2)\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (5,1)\n\n- (4,1)\n\n- (3,1)\n\n- (2,1)\n\n- (2,2)\n\n- (2,3)  -- food here\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (3,3)\n\n- (3,2) tail\n\nSo the snake is mostly on the right and bottom, with a loop on the left.\n\nFrom head (6,6), only move to (5,6).\n\nThen new head (5,6), with body (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), etc.\n\nNow, from (5,6), the cell (5,5) is occupied, (6,6) occupied, (4,6) wall, (5,7) wall, so no move, death.\n\nUnless on turn 91, when I move, the tail has moved, but the tail is at (3,2), which is far, so when I move from (5,6), the tail moves to the next position, but in this case, the cells adjacent to head are still occupied.\n\nAfter moving to (5,6), the new tail is (3,3), but that doesn't free any cell near (5,6).\n\nSo I think the snake is doomed.\n\nBut perhaps for the sake of the game, I have to make the move.\n\nSo for turn 90, action L.\n\nThen for turn 91, no possible move, so I die.\n\nBut that can't be the intention; maybe I misread the head direction or something.\n\nHead direction is U, and positions show head at (6,6), previous at (6,5), so moving up.\n\nPerhaps the food at (2,3) can be eaten later, but I need to survive first.\n\nAnother thought: is (5,6) really empty? Let's list all occupied cells.\n\nSnake positions: (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2)\n\nWalls: x=0,7 y=0,7 and (4,6)\n\nSo (5,6) is not in snake, not wall, so empty.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) is head, (6,5) body, etc.\n\nSo only move is to (5,6).\n\nPerhaps the snake can eat food to grow, but there's no food near.\n\nFood at (1,4) and (2,3), both not near head.\n\n(1,4) is at x=1,y=4, head at (6,6), far away.\n\n(2,3) is occupied, so can't eat now.\n\nSo I think for turn 90, I must move L to (5,6).\n\nThen on turn 91, I have no move, so the game ends.\n\nBut the problem asks to think 5+ turns ahead, but in this case, I can't even survive one more turn.\n\nPerhaps I should output the move for turn 90.\n\nThen for future turns, since I die, I can't.\n\nBut let's assume that after moving to (5,6), on turn 91, I might have a move if the tail moves, but no, the cells are blocked.\n\nUnless I can move down to (5,5) but it's body.\n\nBut at the moment of move, if (5,5) is the tail, but it's not; it's a body segment.\n\nRule: only tail cell can be moved into because it moves away.\n\nHere, (5,5) is not tail; tail is (3,2), then after move to (5,6), tail is (3,3), still far.\n\nSo (5,5) is a permanent body segment for now.\n\nSo I think it's game over.\n\nPerhaps for the answer, I should just do turn 90: L\n\nBut let's see the food life span; it doesn't matter since I die.\n\nBut maybe I missed a move.\n\nAnother idea: from (6,6), can I move up? But (6,7) is wall.\n\nOr right, wall.\n\nDown, invalid.\n\nSo only left.\n\nPerhaps the head direction is not binding for the first move, but it is.\n\nI think I have to accept that.\n\nSo for turn 90, action L.\n\nThen for turn 91, no move, so I don't output anything.\n\nBut the answer format is to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps I need to think that after moving to (5,6), the direction is L, and then I can only move if possible, but it's not.\n\nMaybe the internal obstacle is not a wall, but it is.\n\nOr perhaps the grid has more space.\n\nLet's list all free cells.\n\nGrid cells: for x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6 except walls.\n\nWalls: x=0,7 for all y, y=0,7 for all x, and (4,6).\n\nSo free cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to6 except (4,6).\n\nBut (4,6) is wall.\n\nSnake occupies 20 cells, so free cells are few.\n\nFree cells: for example, (1,4) has food, (2,3) has food but occupied, (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,5), (1,6), (2,5), (2,6), (3,5), (3,6), but (3,6) might be free? (3,6) not in snake positions, not wall, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) wall, (5,6) will be head, (6,6) body, etc.\n\nBut from (5,6), I can only go to available directions.\n\nI think I have to conclude that on turn 90, move L to (5,6), and then the snake is trapped.\n\nFor the answer, I'll output turn 90: L\n\nBut since I need to think ahead, and there's no ahead, I'll stop.\n\nBut let's see the food at (2,3): it is under the body at (2,3), which is segment 15.\n\nWhen the snake moves, that segment will move to the next position.\n\nFor example, when snake moves left to (5,6), the body at (2,3) will move to where? Current positions: index 15: (2,3), before that index 14: (2,2), after index 16: (2,4), so it's part of a section.\n\nAfter move, new positions: head (5,6), then (6,6), then (6,5), then (5,5), then (4,5), then (4,4), then (5,4), then (6,4), then (6,3), then (6,2), then (6,1), then (5,1), then (4,1), then (3,1), then (2,1), then (2,2), then (2,3), then (2,4), then (3,4), then (3,3)  -- tail is (3,3) now, since (3,2) removed.\n\nThe body at (2,3) is still there, index 15 or something.\n\n(2,3) is still occupied, so food there can't be eaten.\n\nThe snake needs to move so that the body leaves (2,3), then later head can come.\n\nBut with the current position, it's not possible because the snake is stuck at (5,6).\n\nPerhaps on turn 90, I move to (5,6), then on turn 91, I have to move, but no move, so game over.\n\nI think I should proceed with turn 90: L.\n\nThen for the answer, since I can't move further, I'll only output that.\n\nBut the format says to output for multiple turns, but if I can't, I guess only for this turn.\n\nPerhaps I misread the head direction.\n\nHead direction is U, but at (6,6), moving up is wall, so I must turn.\n\nAnother thought: can I move down? But it's reverse and body, so no.\n\nUnless the body is not there, but it is.\n\nI think I have to accept it.\n\nSo for turn 90, action L.\n\nThen for future turns, since I die, I won't output.\n\nBut for the box, I'll put turn 90: L\n\nBut let's see the food life span; (1,4) has life span 6, so if I could reach it, but I can't.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) life span 8.\n\nBut with death, no point.\n\nPerhaps there's a way to move that I missed.\n\nLet's list all adjacent cells to head (6,6):\n\n- Up: (6,7) wall\n\n- Down: (6,5) body, and reverse not allowed\n\n- Left: (5,6) empty\n\n- Right: (7,6) wall\n\nSo only left.\n\nI think it's correct.\n\nSo for turn 90, action is L.\n\nThen for turn 91, no action possible.\n\nBut since the answer format requires multiple turns, perhaps I need to assume I can move, but I can't.\n\nMaybe after moving to (5,6), the direction is L, and then I can move down if it were free, but it's not.\n\nI think for the purpose of this, I'll output only turn 90: L\n\nAnd for the box, put that.\n\nBut let's check the food at (2,3): it has value 1, and it's on the body, so if the snake can move the body away, then eat it.\n\nFor example, if the snake moves down or something, but from (6,6), I can't.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps on turn 90, I move to (5,6), then on turn 91, from (5,6), I can only move if there is a free cell, but there isn't, so I die.\n\nSo I think that's it.\n\nPerhaps the head direction constraint is only for the first move; for subsequent moves, it's based on the new position.\n\nBut still, from (5,6), with direction L, I can move U, D, L, R with no reverse only.\n\nL wall, U wall, D body, R body and reverse.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think the snake is in a losing position.\n\nFor the answer, I'll put:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 90: L }\n\nSince no further turns.\n\nBut the instruction says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but I can't in this case.\n\nPerhaps for turn 90, I must move L, and that's the only action.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nThe current state shows the snake is in a precarious position at turn 90, with the head at (6,6) facing Up (U). After evaluating all possible moves and considering the grid constraints, only one valid move exists for turn 90: moving Left (L) to (5,6). This is because:\n- Moving Up (U) to (6,7) is invalid due to the wall at y=7.\n- Moving Down (D) is invalid as it is a reverse direction from the current U and would cause immediate collision with the body segment at (6,5).\n- Moving Right (R) to (7,6) is invalid due to the wall at x=7.\n- Moving Left (L) to (5,6) is the only safe and legal move, as (5,6) is unoccupied and not a wall.\n\nAfter moving to (5,6) on turn 90, the snake's head position becomes (5,6) with a new direction of Left (L). However, this position leads to an unavoidable trap on turn 91:\n- From (5,6), moving Left to (4,6) is invalid (internal obstacle wall).\n- Moving Up to (5,7) is invalid (border wall at y=7).\n- Moving Down to (5,5) causes collision with the body segment at (5,5), which is not the tail.\n- Moving Right to (6,6) causes collision with the body segment at (6,6) and is also a reverse direction from L to R, which is not allowed.\n\nThus, there are no valid moves on turn 91, resulting in the snake's death. Given this, no further actions can be planned beyond turn 90.\n\nRegarding the food:\n- Food at (1,4) has a life span of 6, meaning it disappears after turn 95. However, it is unreachable due to the imminent death.\n- Food at (2,3) is under the snake's body and has a life span of 8 (disappears after turn 97). It can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it later, but this is impossible due to the trap.\n\nSince the snake cannot survive beyond turn 90, and thinking 5+ turns ahead is not feasible, only the action for turn 90 is provided.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 90: L\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. It's turn 91, and I have to plan my moves for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 steps ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nThe grid has walls. Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (4,6).\n\nSnake positions are given as a list: head is at (5,6), then (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3). So the snake has 20 segments. The head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to get to (5,6) from the previous position.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (1,4) with value 1 and life span 5\n\n- (2,3) with value 1 and life span 7\n\n- (6,6) with value 1 and life span 10\n\nAll food has value +1, so they're all positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n\nLife span: for (1,4), it disappears after 5 turns, including the current turn, so if not eaten by turn 95, it's gone. Similarly, (2,3) lasts until turn 97, and (6,6) until turn 100.\n\nCurrent turn is 91, so:\n\n- Food at (1,4): life span 5, so disappears after turn 95 (since countdown starts from current turn). Life span N means it disappears after N turns, including current. So if life span is 5 at turn 91, it will be there for turns 91,92,93,94,95, and gone at turn 96. Similarly, (2,3) life span 7: turns 91 to 97, gone at 98. (6,6) life span 10: turns 91 to 100, gone at 101.\n\nNow, I need to decide the next move. Head is at (5,6), direction left. Possible moves: since head direction is left, I can move left (L), up (U), or down (D), but not right (R) because that would be instant reverse. Current head direction is L, so from (5,6), moving left would be to (4,6), but (4,6) is an internal obstacle? Walls include internal obstacle at (4,6), so I cannot move to (4,6).\n\nWalls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacle at (4,6). So (4,6) is a wall cell, cannot move there.\n\nSo from head at (5,6), possible moves:\n\n- Left (L): to (4,6), but (4,6) is wall, so not possible.\n\n- Up (U): to (5,7), but y=7 is border wall, so (5,7) is out of bounds? y=7 is border, so if y=7 is wall, then (5,7) is invalid.\n\nBorder cells: x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So (5,7): x=5, y=7, y=7 is border, so it's a wall cell, cannot move there.\n\nSimilarly, down (D): to (5,5), but (5,5) is occupied by the snake body? Snake positions: head (5,6), then (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), so (5,5) is the fourth segment.\n\nList snake positions: index 0: (5,6) head, 1: (6,6), 2: (6,5), 3: (5,5), 4: (4,5), 5: (4,4), 6: (5,4), 7: (6,4), 8: (6,3), 9: (6,2), 10: (6,1), 11: (5,1), 12: (4,1), 13: (3,1), 14: (2,1), 15: (2,2), 16: (2,3), 17: (2,4), 18: (3,4), 19: (3,3) tail.\n\nSo (5,5) is position 3, which is part of the body. But when moving, if I move down to (5,5), since the snake will move, the tail might move away, but let's see the rules.\n\nCollision: head touches any body segment except that it can move into the tail cell if the tail moves away.\n\nSpecifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, if the head moves to the current tail position, it's ok because the tail moves away.\n\nBut in this case, moving down to (5,5): (5,5) is not the tail; tail is at (3,3). (5,5) is an internal body segment, so moving there would cause collision.\n\nSimilarly, moving left to (4,6) is wall, not possible.\n\nMoving up to (5,7) is border wall, not possible.\n\nWhat about right? But head direction is left, so moving right would be instant reverse, not allowed. \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is L, so opposite is R, so cannot move right.\n\nBut from (5,6), possible moves:\n\n- L: (4,6) wall\n\n- U: (5,7) border wall\n\n- D: (5,5) body, collision\n\n- R: (6,6) but (6,6) is position 1, which is body segment, and not tail, so collision. Also, instant reverse not allowed.\n\n(6,6) is the second segment after head. So if I move right to (6,6), it's occupied by the body, and since it's not the tail, it would be collision.\n\nTail is at (3,3), far away.\n\nSo, all possible moves from (5,6) seem blocked? That can't be right; I must be missing something.\n\nPerhaps I can move to cells that are not occupied or walls.\n\nAvailable cells around (5,6):\n\n- Left: (4,6) - wall\n\n- Up: (5,7) - y=7 border wall\n\n- Down: (5,5) - occupied by snake body at position 3\n\n- Right: (6,6) - occupied by snake body at position 1\n\nNo other directions. So all adjacent cells are either wall or occupied by body, not tail.\n\nBut the snake has to move somewhere. Is there a way out?\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the snake can only move to empty cells or food cells, but in this case, all adjacent cells are invalid.\n\nBut that would mean the snake is trapped and will die, but I think I must have misread the positions.\n\nLet's plot this on a grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (4,6).\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (5,6)\n\nThen: (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)\n\nSo let's list all occupied cells by snake:\n\n(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)\n\nFood at: (1,4), (2,3), (6,6)\n\n(6,6) is food, but it's also occupied by the snake body? Food can spawn under snake body, but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nIn this case, (6,6) has food, but it's currently occupied by the snake body at position 1.\n\nFor the head at (5,6), the only adjacent cells are:\n\n- (4,6): wall\n\n- (5,7): wall (y=7)\n\n- (5,5): snake body\n\n- (6,6): snake body and food, but occupied now.\n\nSo no valid move? But that can't be; the game must be playable.\n\nPerhaps the head can move to (6,6) if it's the tail, but it's not; it's the second segment.\n\nUnless on the next move, when the snake moves, the tail moves, but for the head movement, it has to move to a cell that is not occupied or is the tail cell.\n\nBut (6,6) is not the tail; tail is (3,3).\n\nSo from (5,6), moving to (6,6) would cause collision because (6,6) is occupied and not the tail.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) is occupied and not tail.\n\n(4,6) wall, (5,7) wall.\n\nSo no possible moves? But that means the snake dies immediately. But I think there might be a mistake.\n\nAnother possibility: the food at (6,6) is on the cell, but the snake body is there, so it's occupied, but when the snake moves, if the body moves away, then the cell becomes free, but for the current turn, when deciding to move, the head cannot move to an occupied cell except tail.\n\nBut at this instant, (6,6) is occupied, so head cannot move there.\n\nSimilarly for (5,5).\n\nSo the only way is if there is an empty cell, but there isn't.\n\nPerhaps I misread the head position or something.\n\nHead is at (5,6), and it came from (6,6) since direction is left, so previous position was (6,6), moved left to (5,6).\n\nNow, from (5,6), it can move to adjacent cells.\n\nBut all are blocked.\n\nUnless the down cell (5,5) is not occupied? But from the list, (5,5) is position 3, which is body.\n\nPosition indices: 0: (5,6) head, 1: (6,6), 2: (6,5), 3: (5,5), so (5,5) is occupied by segment 3.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) is occupied by segment 1.\n\nNo other adjacent cells.\n\nSo the snake is trapped. But that can't be right for the problem.\n\nPerhaps the internal obstacle at (4,6) is not a wall for movement? No, it says cells occupied by walls include internal obstacles.\n\n\"Cells occupied by walls: Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7. Internal Obstacles: [(4,6)]\"\n\nSo (4,6) is a wall, so cannot move there.\n\nSimilarly, borders are walls.\n\nSo from (5,6), no valid move, so the snake should die. But that seems odd for a problem where I need to plan ahead.\n\nMaybe I can move to (6,6) because it has food, but the rule is that food under body can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it later, but for now, the cell is occupied, so I can't move there.\n\nThe rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nFor movement, I can only move to an empty cell or the tail cell.\n\nIn this case, (6,6) is not empty and not tail, so I can't move there.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo the only possibility is if there is a cell I missed.\n\nWhat about (4,5) or something? Adjacent cells are only left, up, down, right.\n\n(4,6) left, (5,7) up, (5,5) down, (6,6) right.\n\nAll invalid.\n\nPerhaps the grid has (5,6) at the edge, but y=6, not 7, so (5,7) is above.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the snake can move to a cell that will be free after movement, but no, the movement is simultaneous; the head moves first, then body follows, but for collision check, at the time of move, the cell must be free or tail.\n\nThe rules say: \"head touches any body segment\" for collision, and exception for tail cell.\n\nSo at the start of the turn, the cells are occupied, and when head moves to a cell, if that cell is occupied by body except tail, it collides.\n\nIn this case, all adjacent cells are occupied or wall, so no move possible, death.\n\nBut that can't be; perhaps I have a mistake in the positions.\n\nLet's list all snake positions again: [(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)]\n\nSo cells occupied: (5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)\n\nNow, head at (5,6), adjacent cells:\n\n- (4,6): x=4,y=6, is it wall? Internal obstacle at (4,6), yes, wall.\n\n- (5,7): y=7, border wall.\n\n- (5,5): x=5,y=5, occupied by snake at (5,5) which is position 3.\n\n- (6,6): x=6,y=6, occupied by snake at (6,6) position 1.\n\nNo other cells. So indeed, no valid move. But that means the snake is dead on this turn. But the problem asks for actions, so perhaps for turn 91, I have to choose a move, but all lead to death, so I might as well choose one, but all are invalid.\n\nPerhaps the food at (6,6) can be considered, but the cell is occupied, so I can't move there.\n\nAnother idea: since the head is at (5,6), and the body at (6,6) will move when the snake moves, but for the head to move to (6,6), it would be moving back, which is instant reverse, not allowed, and also occupied.\n\nInstant reverse is not allowed, so cannot move right to (6,6) anyway.\n\nSo only possible moves are L, U, D, all invalid.\n\nSo the snake must collide no matter what. But that seems like a game over situation.\n\nPerhaps I misread the head direction. Head direction is L, so it was moving left, so from (6,6) to (5,6), so previous was (6,6).\n\nNow, from (5,6), moving left to (4,6) is wall, up to (5,7) wall, down to (5,5) body, right to (6,6) body and reverse not allowed.\n\nSo no.\n\nUnless the down cell (5,5) is not considered occupied for some reason, but it is.\n\nPerhaps the tail is moving, but at the time of move, (5,5) is occupied.\n\nI think I have to accept that for turn 91, there is no safe move, so the game ends.\n\nBut that can't be the intention; maybe I missed a cell.\n\nWhat about (6,7) or something? No, (6,7) is y=7, wall, not adjacent.\n\nOr (4,5), but (4,5) is not adjacent to (5,6); adjacent are only (4,6), (5,7), (5,5), (6,6).\n\n(4,5) is down-left, not adjacent; adjacent means sharing edge, so only up, down, left, right.\n\nSo yes, no move.\n\nPerhaps the internal obstacle is not at (4,6), but let's check: \"Internal Obstacles: [(4,6)]\" so yes.\n\nMaybe the border walls are only the lines, but cells are (0,0) to (7,7), so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls.\n\nSo (5,7) has y=7, wall.\n\nSimilarly, (4,6) is internal wall.\n\nSo I think the snake is trapped.\n\nBut let's look at the food at (6,6): it has life span 10, and it's under the body at position 1.\n\nBut for the head to eat it, the body must move away and head move onto it, but currently, the body at (6,6) will move when the snake moves.\n\nFor example, if the snake moves down to (5,5), but that's occupied, and collision.\n\nI think I have to conclude that there is no valid move, so for turn 91, any action will cause death, so the game ends.\n\nBut that seems odd for the problem.\n\nPerhaps the head can move to (5,5) if it is the tail, but it's not; tail is (3,3).\n\nOr maybe on the next move, the tail moves, but for the head move, it has to be valid at that instant.\n\nI think I should assume that for turn 91, I must choose a move, and it will result in death, but since the problem asks for actions, I need to choose one.\n\nBut all are invalid, so perhaps choose U or something, but it's wall.\n\nMaybe the grid is 1-based or something, but no, it says x=0/x=7, so 0 to 7 inclusive, 8 cells.\n\nAnother possibility: the snake positions have (6,6) as the first body segment, but when the head moves, the body segments shift, so if I move down to (5,5), but (5,5) is currently occupied, so when head moves to (5,5), it collides with the body there.\n\nSimilarly, if I could move to (6,6), but it's occupied and reverse not allowed.\n\nSo I think it's hopeless.\n\nPerhaps for the food at (6,6), since it's under the body, and if the body moves away, but for the head to move there, it would be reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo no way.\n\nI think I have to proceed with the assumption that from (5,6), I can only move to invalid cells, so the snake dies.\n\nBut let's check if there is a mistake in the state.\n\nCurrent turn 91, head at (5,6), direction L.\n\nFood at (2,3) is also occupied? (2,3) is position 16, (2,3) is occupied by snake, and food is there, so food under body.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4) is not occupied, I think.\n\n (1,4): x=1,y=4, let's see if it's in snake positions: snake has (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), etc. (1,4) is not in the list, so it's free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3) is in the list as position 16, so occupied.\n\nFood at (2,3) is under the body.\n\nBut for the head, it's far away.\n\nBack to the head.\n\nPerhaps from (5,6), the only possible move is down to (5,5), but it will collide, so death.\n\nOr up to (5,7) wall, death.\n\nSo for turn 91, I have to choose an action, say D, and die.\n\nBut then no need to plan ahead.\n\nBut the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", so there must be a way.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the head can move to a cell that has food under body, but only if it's the tail, but (6,6) is not tail.\n\nLet's list the tail: positions, last is (3,3), so tail at (3,3).\n\n (6,6) is position 1, so not tail.\n\nSo I think I have to accept that for turn 91, moving down to (5,5) is the only option, but it causes collision.\n\nUnless (5,5) is not considered for collision because it will be vacated, but the rules say head touches body segment, and at the time of move, (5,5) is occupied, so it collides.\n\nThe exception is only for the tail cell.\n\nSo I think it's collision.\n\nPerhaps in this case, since the snake is long, moving down might be possible if the body moves, but the head moves first, so when head moves to (5,5), the body is still there, so collision.\n\nIn standard Snake, when the head moves to a new cell, if that cell is not free, it collides, except if it's the tail.\n\nHere, (5,5) is not tail, so collision.\n\nSimilarly for other cells.\n\nSo I think for turn 91, the snake must die.\n\nBut to proceed, I'll assume that I move down to (5,5) and die, but that ends the game, so no further turns.\n\nBut the problem asks for actions for turn 91 and beyond, so perhaps I need to find a way.\n\nMaybe the head direction allows me to move in certain ways.\n\nHead direction is L, so I can move L, U, or D, not R.\n\nL to (4,6) wall, U to (5,7) wall, D to (5,5) body.\n\nAll bad.\n\nPerhaps the internal obstacle at (4,6) is not a wall for some reason, but it is.\n\nI think I have to look for a different approach.\n\nLet's list all free cells on the grid.\n\nGrid cells: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to7, walls at borders and (4,6).\n\nSo free cells are all except walls and snake occupied.\n\nWalls: all (0,y) for y=0 to7, all (7,y) for y=0 to7, all (x,0) for x=0 to7, all (x,7) for x=0 to7, and (4,6).\n\nSnake occupied: as listed.\n\nFor example, (1,4) is free, has food.\n\n(2,3) is occupied, has food under body.\n\n(6,6) occupied, food under body.\n\nOther free cells: for example, (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7) but y=7 wall, etc.\n\nBut for the head, it's stuck.\n\nPerhaps the snake can move in a way that the body shifts to free up a cell.\n\nBut from (5,6), no adjacent free cell.\n\nThe only adjacent cells are all blocked.\n\nSo I think it's impossible to move without dying.\n\nTherefore, for turn 91, I must choose an action that leads to death, say D to (5,5), and the game ends.\n\nBut since the problem asks for multiple turns, perhaps I should choose an action and assume it works, but it doesn't.\n\nMaybe the food at (6,6) can be eaten if I move in a way that the body moves away.\n\nFor example, if I move down to (5,5), but I can't because it's occupied.\n\nIf I could move to (6,6), but I can't because it's occupied and reverse not allowed.\n\nSo no.\n\nI think I have to accept the situation and move to (5,5) for turn 91, resulting in death, so no further actions.\n\nBut let's see the answer format; it says to provide actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nPerhaps for turn 91, I can move down, and even though it collides, I have to specify.\n\nBut then for turn 92, there is no snake.\n\nSo maybe only one action.\n\nBut that seems silly.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the head direction is used to determine no reverse, but for the first move, I can choose any except reverse.\n\nBut all choices are bad.\n\nPerhaps the cell (5,5) is the tail in the next move, but no, tail is (3,3).\n\nWhen the snake moves, the tail moves, but for the head move, it has to be to a cell that is not occupied at that time.\n\nI think I'm stuck.\n\nLet's read the state again.\n\n\"Snake Positions\":[(5,6), (6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3)]\n\nPosition 0: (5,6) head\n\nPosition 1: (6,6)\n\nPosition 2: (6,5)\n\nPosition 3: (5,5)\n\nPosition 4: (4,5)\n\netc.\n\nAfter the head moves, the body segments follow the leader.\n\nSo if head moves to a new position, the segment at position 1 moves to the old head position, position 2 moves to old position 1, and so on, and the tail moves away.\n\nBut for the head move, it must be to a free cell or the tail cell.\n\nHere, no free cell adjacent, and tail is far, so no.\n\nUnless I can move to a cell that is the tail, but tail is at (3,3), not adjacent.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nPerhaps for the food at (2,3), it is occupied, but if the body moves away, it can be eaten later.\n\nBut for the head, it's not relevant now.\n\nI think I have to assume that for turn 91, I move down to (5,5), collide and die.\n\nSo for the answer, I can say:\n\nTurn 91: D\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nBut let's see if there is a way. Maybe I missed that (4,6) is not a wall for all, but it is.\n\nAnother thought: the internal obstacle at (4,6) might be the only one, but it is a wall.\n\nPerhaps the border walls are only the cells, but (5,7) is border.\n\nI give up.\n\nLet's look at the food at (6,6): it has life span 10, so it will be there for a while.\n\nBut for the head to eat it, the body at (6,6) must move away.\n\nCurrently, position 1 is at (6,6).\n\nWhen the snake moves, if the head moves to a new position, then position 1 will move to (5,6), the current head position.\n\nSo if the head moves away from (5,6), then (6,6) will be vacated because position 1 moves to (5,6), so (6,6) becomes free.\n\nBut for the head to move to (6,6), it would be moving right, which is instant reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo I can't move to (6,6) directly.\n\nLater, if I can manuever to come back, but from (5,6), I can't move anywhere.\n\nUnless I move down to (5,5), but it's occupied, so I die.\n\nPerhaps in some implementations, the head can move to a body cell if it is not permanent, but the rules say collision.\n\nI think for the sake of this problem, I should consider moving down to (5,5) as the only choice, and assume it causes death, but since the problem asks for actions, I'll provide it and then no further.\n\nBut let's see the tail reward danger: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nBut here, tail is at (3,3), head at (5,6), not adjacent.\n\nSo not relevant.\n\nI think I have to start with turn 91 action.\n\nPerhaps there is a mistake in the state, or I misread.\n\nAnother idea: the head at (5,6), and the cell (4,6) is wall, but perhaps I can move to (4,5) or something, but (4,5) is not adjacent; it's diagonal, not allowed, only orthogonal.\n\nSo no.\n\nI think I should proceed with moving down to (5,5) for turn 91, and since it collides, game over, so only one action.\n\nBut for the sake of planning, assume that it doesn't collide or something, but that's against rules.\n\nPerhaps the position (5,5) is the tail in some sense, but it's not.\n\nLet's list the positions in order of movement.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the tail will move from (3,3) to the previous position of the segment before it.\n\nThe snake has 20 segments.\n\nAfter a move, the head is at new position, then position 1 at old head, position 2 at old position 1, ..., position 19 at old position 18, position 20 (tail) at old position 19.\n\nOld tail at old position 20 is vacated.\n\nBut for the head move, it needs to be to a free cell or the current tail cell.\n\nCurrent tail is (3,3), not adjacent to head.\n\nSo no.\n\nI think I have to accept the situation.\n\nPerhaps for turn 91, I can move up to (5,7), but it's wall, die.\n\nOr left to (4,6) wall, die.\n\nOr down to (5,5) body, die.\n\nOr right to (6,6) body and reverse, not allowed and die.\n\nSo all choices die.\n\nI'll choose down for turn 91.\n\nThen for turn 92, no snake, so no action.\n\nBut the answer format requires multiple turns, so perhaps I need to provide actions assuming survival.\n\nBut that's not realistic.\n\nMaybe the head can move to a cell that has food under body, but only if it's free, which it's not.\n\nI think I'll move down and assume it works for now, but it doesn't.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the cell (5,5) is occupied, but when I move down, the head moves to (5,5), and at the same time, the body at (5,5) is still there, so collision occurs.\n\nSo I think it's death.\n\nPerhaps the rules allow moving to the cell that the body is leaving, but in standard Snake, it's not allowed; you collide if you hit the body.\n\nHere the rules say \"body collision (head touches any body segment)\" with exception for tail.\n\nSo (5,5) is a body segment, not tail, so collision.\n\nSo for turn 91, action D, and game over.\n\nSo in the answer, I'll put Turn 91: D\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nBut since the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", there might be a way.\n\nLet's count the life span.\n\nTurn 91, food at (1,4) life span 5, so gone after turn 95.\n\n (2,3) life span 7, gone after turn 97.\n\n (6,6) life span 10, gone after turn 100.\n\nBut the head is stuck.\n\nPerhaps the snake can be saved if I can move, but I can't.\n\nI think I have to look for a different interpretation.\n\nMaybe the head direction is not used for the first move choice, but for no reverse.\n\nBut still, no move available.\n\nPerhaps the internal obstacle at (4,6) is not a wall, but it is.\n\nOr maybe it's a typo, and it's not a wall, but the state says it is.\n\nI think I should assume that (4,6) is not a wall for some reason, but the state says \"Internal Obstacles: [(4,6)]\", so it is a wall.\n\nPerhaps \"cells occupied by walls\" means that those cells are walls, so cannot move there.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nFor the sake of proceeding, I'll assume that from (5,6), I can move down to (5,5) without collision, even though it should, so that I can plan ahead.\n\nOtherwise, I can't do anything.\n\nSo let's assume that for turn 91, I move down to (5,5).\n\nThen, since I move to (5,5), and (5,5) was occupied by position 3, but if I assume no collision, then the head moves to (5,5), and the body: position 1 moves to (5,6), position 2 moves to (6,6), position 3 moves to (6,5), and so on.\n\nOld positions:\n\nHead was at (5,6)\n\nPosition 1 at (6,6)\n\nPosition 2 at (6,5)\n\nPosition 3 at (5,5)\n\nPosition 4 at (4,5)\n\netc.\n\nAfter move down to (5,5):\n\nNew head position: (5,5)\n\nThen position 1 (first body segment) moves to old head position (5,6)\n\nPosition 2 moves to old position 1 (6,6)\n\nPosition 3 moves to old position 2 (6,5)\n\nPosition 4 moves to old position 3 (5,5) but (5,5) is the new head position, so position 4 moves to (5,5)? No.\n\nThe body segments move to the previous position of the segment before them.\n\nAfter head moves to new position, the first body segment (index 1) moves to the previous position of the head, which is (5,6).\n\nThen index 2 moves to the previous position of index 1, which was (6,6).\n\nIndex 3 moves to previous position of index 2, which was (6,5).\n\nIndex 4 moves to previous position of index 3, which was (5,5).\n\nBut (5,5) is now the head position, so if index 4 moves to (5,5), it would be on the head, but usually, the body segments move after the head, so the head is at (5,5), then index 1 at (5,6), index 2 at (6,6), index 3 at (6,5), index 4 at (5,5) but (5,5) is occupied by head, so collision.\n\nIn this case, position 4 is moving to (5,5), which is where the head is, so it collides.\n\nBut in the sequence, position 4 moves to the old position of index 3, which was (5,5), but at that time, the head has already moved to (5,5), so when position 4 moves to (5,5), it is occupied, so collision.\n\nSo even if I move to (5,5), it causes collision with the body.\n\nSimilarly for other moves.\n\nSo definitely death.\n\nI think for turn 91, the only choice is to move and die.\n\nSo I'll provide the action for turn 91 only.\n\nBut let's see if there is a way to move to a different cell.\n\nPerhaps the head can move to (6,6) if I ignore reverse, but not allowed.\n\nI think I have to box the answer with only turn 91.\n\nBut the format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, etc.\" so perhaps for turn 91, I put D, and for later turns, nothing, but I need to write it.\n\nPerhaps the snake can be saved by not moving, but I have to move each turn.\n\nI think I'll provide the action for turn 91 as D, and that's it.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 91: D\n}\n\nBut let's confirm the direction.\n\nHead at (5,6), move D to (5,5).\n\nThen collide and die.\n\nSo no further actions.\n\nPerhaps for the food, but not relevant.\n\nSo I think that's it.\n</think>\nThe current state shows the snake head at (5,6) with direction left (L). The adjacent cells are analyzed as follows:\n- Left (L) to (4,6): This cell is an internal obstacle (wall), so it is invalid.\n- Up (U) to (5,7): This cell is on the border wall (y=7), so it is invalid.\n- Down (D) to (5,5): This cell is occupied by the snake's body segment at position 3, which is not the tail. Moving here results in a body collision.\n- Right (R) to (6,6): This cell is occupied by the snake's body segment at position 1, which is not the tail, and moving right is an instant reverse from the current left direction, so it is invalid.\n\nAll possible moves lead to a collision or wall impact, meaning the snake has no safe move on turn 91. The only adjacent cells are walls or body segments, and the tail is at (3,3), which is not adjacent. Therefore, any move results in death, ending the game. The down (D) move is chosen as it is one of the possible actions, but it causes immediate collision.\n\nNo further turns are possible as the snake dies on turn 91. Thus, only the action for turn 91 is provided.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 91: D\n}",
