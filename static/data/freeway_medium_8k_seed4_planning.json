        "thinking": "<think>We are given the initial position at turn t1 = 0: (0,0) and we need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions.\n\nThe grid has freeways at y=1 to y=8 (each row). The player moves vertically (y-direction) and the cars move horizontally (x-direction) on their freeways.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at that turn and the car's span at that turn includes x=0.\n\nNote: The player is at x=0 at every turn, so we only care about the car spans that cover x=0 at the exact turn when the player is on that freeway.\n\nPlayer movement:\n- At each turn, the player chooses an action: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), or S (stay, y same).\n- The player cannot go below y=0 or above y=9. So we are bounded.\n\nCar movement:\n- Each car is defined by (head, tail, direction, speed). Note: For left-moving, the head is the rightmost point? Actually, the representation is:\n  - Left-moving: initially [h, tau] (with h > tau, I assume) and then moves left: so at time T, it's [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\n  - Right-moving: initially [tau, h] (so tau is left, h is right) and then moves right: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut note the given data: \nFor freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3) -> but wait, if it's right-moving, then the initial span is [tau, h] = [-59, -48]? But the representation in the table is (head, tail, direction, speed). Let me clarify:\n\nThe problem says:\n- Left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, tau]\" -> then h is the head (rightmost) and tau the tail (leftmost). Then it moves left: so the head becomes h - s*(T-t1), tail becomes tau - s*(T-t1).\n- Right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" -> so tau is the leftmost (tail) and h is the rightmost (head). Then it moves right: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut in the table, the cars are given as (head, tail, direction, speed). So for a right-moving car, the head is the right end and tail is the left end? Or is the representation (h, tau) meaning the same as in the rule?\n\nActually, the rule for right-moving says: initially [tau, h] meaning from left to right: tau (left) to h (right). So in the table, the first number is the tail (left) and the second is the head (right) for right-moving? But wait, the table says for freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3). \n\nThis is confusing because -48 is greater than -59. If the car is right-moving, then the initial span should be [tau, h] = [-59, -48]? Because the tail (left) is -59 and the head (right) is -48? But the table says head=-48 and tail=-59. So the representation is (head, tail) but for a right-moving car, head is the right end and tail is the left end? That makes sense: head = -48 (right end) and tail = -59 (left end). Then the initial span is [tail, head] = [-59, -48].\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car, the representation (head, tail) would have head as the leftmost? Actually, the rule for left-moving says: initial span [h, tau] and then moves left. And in the rule, for left-moving, h is the head (which is the right end initially) and tau the tail (left end). But then if the car is left-moving, the head should be greater than the tail? \n\nHowever, in the given data, all cars are right-moving? Let me check:\n\nFreeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3) -> so direction is right. Then initial span is [tail, head] = [-59, -48] (because tail is -59 and head is -48? But the problem says for right-moving: [tau, h] and then moves right. So we'll take the tail as the left end and head as the right end.\n\nBut wait, the problem states for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" and then moves to [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So the representation in the table for a right-moving car is (h, tau) or (tau, h)? Actually, the table says: \"Cars (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s)\". So the first number is the head, the second is the tail. \n\nBut for a right-moving car, the head (right end) should be greater than the tail (left end). Here, -48 > -59, so that matches. So the initial span for the car on freeway 1 (right-moving) is [tail, head] = [-59, -48]. Then at time T (relative to t1=0), the span becomes: \n  left end = tail + s*T = -59 + 3*T\n  right end = head + s*T = -48 + 3*T\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 6: two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12). \nFirst car: head=48, tail=37 -> so initial [37,48] and then at time T: [37+12*T, 48+12*T]\nSecond car: head=0, tail=-11 -> initial [-11,0], at time T: [-11+12*T, 0+12*T]\n\nBut note: the problem says collision occurs only if at turn T the player is on that freeway and 0 is in the car's span at that exact T.\n\nWe start at (0,0) at turn0 (t1=0). We can only move to y=0,1,...,9.\n\nGoal: reach y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nWe are to output a sequence of actions starting at turn t1 (which is 0) for H turns, so that at the last turn (turn0+H-1) we are at y=9.\n\nWe need to avoid being on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at a turn T when there is a car on that freeway whose span covers 0 at that exact T.\n\nNote: The player moves at the same turn: \n- At turn T, we choose an action. Then the player's new y position is updated for turn T+1? \nBut the update rule says: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t, and we choose a_t, then at turn t+1 we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nHowever, the collision condition: \n  \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nHere, y_T is the player's y-coordinate at turn T.\n\nSo at turn T, we are at (0, y_T). If y_T is between 1 and 8, then we check the cars on freeway y_T at turn T: if any car's span at turn T includes x=0, then collision.\n\nImportant note: when we move, we are not on the destination freeway until the next turn. Specifically, if at turn T we are at y_T and we choose to move to y_{T+1} (which might be y_T+1, y_T-1, or same), then at turn T we are still on freeway y_T (if y_T is between 1 and 8) and then at turn T+1 we are on y_{T+1}.\n\nTherefore, the movement is safe in the sense that we don't get hit by a car on the freeway we are moving to until we actually are on it at the next turn.\n\nStrategy: We need to get from y=0 to y=9 in minimal steps. The minimal number of steps would be 9 moves upward (if we could go straight without any car hitting). But we have 8 freeways (y=1 to 8) that might have cars at x=0 at the time we are there.\n\nWe are to simulate the path and check for collisions.\n\nGiven the car movements, we can compute for each freeway and each turn T (starting from 0) whether there is a car at x=0 on that freeway at turn T.\n\nBut note: the problem does not require us to compute for all T, but we are to find a minimal path.\n\nWe can do a BFS (breadth-first search) in the state space (turn, y) but note that the state space for turn might be large because the cars move continuously and we might have to wait.\n\nHowever, note that the cars move periodically? Actually, the speeds are integers and the cars are moving at constant speed. The grid is infinite in x, but we only care about when the car covers x=0.\n\nFor each freeway, we can compute the times when it is safe to be at that freeway (i.e., no car at x=0). Then we can plan a path that avoids being on a freeway at an unsafe time.\n\nBut note: we start at turn0 at y0=0. We are not on any freeway (since freeways are y=1..8) at turn0? Actually, at turn0 we are at y0=0, which is not a freeway (freeways are 1 to 8) so we are safe.\n\nThen at each turn, we choose an action: U, D, or S.\n\nWe want the minimal H such that we can be at y=9 at turn (H-1) (because we start at turn0, then after H-1 actions we have done H-1 steps and we are at turn H-1).\n\nActually, the sequence of actions is for t from t1 (0) to t1+H-1 (so H actions) and the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and then we are at y_{t1+H} = 9? But note the problem says: we are to have a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that after applying these H actions, the player is at (0,9). \n\nBut the update: \n  y_{t1} = initial y (0)\n  after a_{t1} (at turn0) we get y1 = y0 + Delta = 0 + (if U:1, D:-1, S:0) -> so at turn1 we are at y1.\n\nThen after H actions, the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and then at turn t1+H we are at the final y. And we require that at turn t1+H we are at y=9? \n\nBut note the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1? Actually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and we are to have y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nLet me read: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd the sequence is for turns t1 to t1+H-1? Then the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and at that turn we are at y_{t1+H-1}? \n\nBut the update rule: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn t, we are at y_t. We choose a_t, then we move to y_{t+1} which is the state for the next turn.\n\nTherefore, at turn t, we are at y_t. We require that at the last turn (turn t1+H-1) we are at y_{t1+H-1} = 9? \n\nBut note: the problem says \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning we apply H actions. The first action is at t1 (turn0) and leads to y1 at turn1. The last action is at turn t1+H-1 and leads to y_{t1+H} at turn t1+H. \n\nBut the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nWait, the index: \n  t = t1: we are at y_{t1} = 0.\n  Then we apply a_{t1}: then at turn t1+1 we are at y_{t1+1}.\n\nSo after applying the sequence of H actions, the final state is at turn t1+H. But the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nThis is confusing. Let me look again:\n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and we are to have \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\nBut note: at the time we apply the last action (which is at turn t1+H-1), we are at y_{t1+H-1}. Then we apply a_{t1+H-1} and then we become y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Delta.\n\nBut we require that at the end of the sequence, we are at (0,9). That should be at the state after the last action, i.e., at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nI think there is an inconsistency. Let me check the problem statement:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nand then in the answer format: \n\nTurn t1: a_{t1}\n...\nTurn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nand then after the last action, we are at turn t1+H? \n\nBut the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nActually, it says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\" in the task? \n\nRe-reading: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\nSo the state at turn t1+H-1 must be 9. But note: at turn t1+H-1, we have not taken the action yet? \n\nActually, the state y_t is defined at the beginning of turn t. Then we choose an action a_t, and then we move to y_{t+1}. \n\nSo if we require y_{t1+H-1} = 9, that means at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. Then we don't need to do anything? But we have to output an action for that turn? \n\nThis is ambiguous. But note the sequence has H actions, from t1 to t1+H-1. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal H might be defined as the number of turns we use (including the starting turn?) but the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence has H actions? \n\nAnother interpretation: we start at turn t1 (0) at position (0,0). Then we take H actions and end up at (0,9) at the end of the H-th action, which is turn t1+H. But the problem says the sequence is for turns t1 to t1+H-1, so that would be H actions and we end at turn t1+H. \n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nI see: the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\" meaning at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. But then we have to output an action for turn t1+H-1? And that action might change it? \n\nThat doesn't make sense because we are already at 9. \n\nI think there might be a misunderstanding. Let me look at the update: the position at turn t is (0, y_t). Then we choose a_t, and then we get y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta. \n\nSo to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn T, we must have arrived at the previous turn. \n\nThe requirement is: at the last turn of the sequence (which is turn t1+H-1) we are at y=9? But at the beginning of that turn we are at y_{t1+H-1}. Then we choose an action. But we want to be at 9 at the beginning of that turn? Then we don't need to move. \n\nBut note: we are to output an action for that turn. So if we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we can choose S (stay). Then we remain at 9 for the next state (turn t1+H), but we don't care about turn t1+H? \n\nThe problem says: we want to reach (0,9). So if at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9, then we have reached. We output the action for that turn as S? \n\nBut then the sequence has H actions, and we are at 9 at the beginning of the last turn. \n\nAlternatively, we might reach 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H. Then we would have applied H actions and the state at turn t1+H is 9. But the problem says we require y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nI think the problem has a typo. Let me check: \n\nThe task: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nBut the initial state is at turn t1: y_{t1} = 0.\n\nAfter one action (H=1), we would have only one action: a_{t1}. Then we would be at y_{t1+1} = 0 + Delta. We require y_{t1} = 9? But we start at 0. So that is impossible.\n\nTherefore, I believe the requirement is that after H actions, we are at y_{t1+H} = 9. And the sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1+H-1, leading to y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBut the problem explicitly says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nI must be missing something. \n\nLet me read the problem again: \n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nand then in the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nSo after the first action (at t1), we get y_{t1+1}. After the last action (at t1+H-1), we get y_{t1+H}. \n\nWe require y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nThis is a contradiction. \n\nLooking at the task: \"Find a sequence of actions ... which minimizes H such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nIt says y_{t1+H-1}=9. \n\nThat means at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. Then we output an action for that turn? And then we move to y_{t1+H} which might be 9 (if we choose S) or 10 (if we choose U) or 8 (if we choose D). \n\nBut we want to be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. \n\nHow do we get there? We must have been at 8,9, or 10 at turn t1+H-2? But 10 is not allowed (since y in [0,9]). \n\nSo we must have been at 8 or 9 at turn t1+H-2. \n\nAnd then we choose an action at turn t1+H-2 to get to 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut the minimal path would then be: we start at turn0 at y0=0. We want to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn T (which is t1+H-1). \n\nThe number of actions is H = T - t1? Since we start at turn0, and we want to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn T, then we have applied T actions? (from turn0 to turn T-1). \n\nBut the sequence of actions is from turn0 to turn T-1, so H = T. \n\nAnd we require that at turn T we are at 9.\n\nBut then the last action is at turn T-1, and it moves us to 9 at turn T.\n\nSo the condition is: at turn T, we are at 9. And T = H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", and then we output actions for turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nSo the total turns we use: we start at turn0, then we act at turn0, turn1, ... turn H-1, and then at turn H we are at 9.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is the minimal number of actions required to get to 9 at turn H.\n\nAnd we must avoid collisions at every turn from 0 to H-1? Because at turn t (from 0 to H-1), we are at y_t, and if y_t is between 1 and 8, we must not be hit.\n\nBut note: at turn H, we are at 9, which is not a freeway (freeways are 1..8), so no collision check needed.\n\nSo we need to simulate from turn0 to turn H-1: we are at y_t at turn t, and we choose an action to get to y_{t+1}.\n\nWe start at turn0: y0=0 (safe, because y0=0 is not a freeway).\n\nWe want to reach y_H = 9.\n\nWe can use BFS: state = (t, y) meaning at turn t we are at y. We start at (0,0). We want to find the minimal H such that we have a state (H, 9) and we have a path to it.\n\nBut note: the state space for t might be large, but we can bound it by some maximal turns. Alternatively, we can try to compute the safety of freeways at each turn.\n\nFirst, let's precompute for each freeway (1 to 8) and for each turn t (starting from 0) whether it is safe to be on that freeway at turn t.\n\nSafe: no car on that freeway has a span covering 0 at turn t.\n\nHow to compute for a given freeway k and turn t:\n\nFor each car on freeway k:\n  If the car is right-moving: \n      span at time t: [tau + s*t, h + s*t]\n  If the car is left-moving: \n      span at time t: [h - s*t, tau - s*t]   -> but note: for left-moving, the initial span [h, tau] (with h>tau) becomes [h-s*t, tau-s*t] and since s>0, the left end is h-s*t and the right end is tau-s*t? Actually, if the car moves left, then the entire span shifts left. But note: if h > tau, then the initial span is from tau to h? Actually, the problem says for left-moving: initial span [h, tau] -> but [h, tau] would be decreasing if h>tau? \n\nWait, the problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1)=[h, tau]\" and then moves to [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. This is a bit ambiguous. \n\nIn mathematics, [a,b] typically means the interval from a to b, but if a>b, then it would be empty? But that doesn't make sense. \n\nI think the problem means: the car occupies a contiguous interval. For a left-moving car, the head (which is the front when moving left) is at a greater x initially, and then moves left. So the initial head is at h, the tail at tau, and we assume h >= tau. Then the interval is [min(h,tau), max(h,tau)]? \n\nBut the problem says: \"left-moving: Span(t1)=[h, tau]\" and then moves to [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt]. \n\nIf h and tau are such that h>tau, then the initial span is [tau, h]? But the problem writes [h, tau] which would be reversed. \n\nLooking at the right-moving: they write [tau, h] for the initial span, meaning tau is left and h is right. \n\nFor left-moving, they write [h, tau], and then it moves left. So if the car is moving left, then the head is at a larger x initially? For example, a car moving left might start at [50, 40]: then head=50, tail=40. Then at time t, it becomes [50 - s*t, 40 - s*t]. So the interval is [40 - s*t, 50 - s*t] (because 40-s*t <= 50-s*t). \n\nSo in fact, the car occupies the interval from min(h, tau) to max(h, tau). But the representation in the problem for left-moving is given as [h, tau] but then it becomes [h - s*t, tau - s*t]. Since the car moves left, the entire interval shifts left. \n\nBut in the given data, all cars are right-moving? Let me check:\n\nFreeway 1: direction right.\nFreeway 2,3,4,5: direction right.\nFreeway 6: two cars, both right.\nFreeway 7: two cars, both right.\nFreeway 8: two cars, both right.\n\nSo there are no left-moving cars. Only right-moving.\n\nTherefore, for every car, the initial span is [tail, head] (with tail = left end, head = right end) and at time t, the span is [tail + s*t, head + s*t].\n\nWe need to check if 0 is in [tail+s*t, head+s*t] at time t.\n\nThis happens if:\n   tail + s*t <= 0 <= head + s*t.\n\nGiven the cars:\n\nFreeway 1: car = (-48, -59, right, 3) -> tail=-59, head=-48? But the table says head=-48, tail=-59. So [tail, head] = [-59, -48]. \n  Condition: -59 + 3*t <= 0 <= -48 + 3*t\n  Solve: \n      -59 + 3*t <= 0 -> 3*t <= 59 -> t <= 59/3 = 19.666 -> t<=19\n      0 <= -48 + 3*t -> 3*t>=48 -> t>=16.\n  So t in [16,19] -> unsafe at t=16,17,18,19.\n\nFreeway 2: car (48,37,right,12) -> tail=37, head=48? But 37>48? That doesn't make sense. The table says head=48, tail=37. So tail=37, head=48? But then tail>head? \n\nWait, the problem says for right-moving: the initial span is [tau, h] meaning from left to right. So if tail=37 and head=48, then that would be [37,48] -> which is fine. But the table says (head, tail) = (48,37) -> so head=48, tail=37. Then the initial span is [tail, head] = [37,48]. \n\nThen at time t: [37+12*t, 48+12*t]. \n  Condition: 37+12*t <= 0 <= 48+12*t -> \n      First: 37+12*t <=0 -> 12*t<=-37 -> t<= -37/12 -> negative, impossible.\n      Second: 0<=48+12*t -> always true for t>=0.\n  So the first inequality never holds. Therefore, this car never covers 0? \n\nBut wait, 37+12*t is increasing and starts at 37 (at t=0) which is positive. So 0 is always to the left of the car. Therefore, freeway 2 is always safe? \n\nSimilarly, freeway 3,4,5: same car? (48,37,right,12) -> same as freeway2: always safe.\n\nFreeway 6: two cars.\n  First car: (48,37,right,12) -> same as above: safe always.\n  Second car: (0,-11,right,12) -> tail=-11, head=0. Then at time t: [-11+12*t, 0+12*t] = [12*t-11, 12*t].\n  Condition: 12*t-11 <= 0 <= 12*t.\n  -> 12*t-11<=0 -> t<=11/12 -> t=0: then 12*0-11 = -11<=0, and 0<=0 -> so at t=0: 0 is in [ -11, 0]? Yes, at t=0: the car is from -11 to 0, so it covers 0.\n      t=0: unsafe.\n      t=1: [1,12] -> 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe.\n      t>=1: safe? \n  But wait: at t=0: unsafe.\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n  First car: tail=-59, head=-48 -> at time t: [-59+6*t, -48+6*t]\n      Condition: -59+6*t <= 0 <= -48+6*t\n      -> 6*t<=59 -> t<=59/6≈9.83 -> t<=9\n          and 6*t>=48 -> t>=8.\n      So t in [8,9] -> unsafe at t=8,9.\n  Second car: tail=-11, head=0 -> at time t: [-11+6*t, 0+6*t] = [6*t-11, 6*t]\n      Condition: 6*t-11<=0<=6*t\n      -> 6*t-11<=0 -> t<=11/6≈1.83 -> t<=1\n          and 0<=6*t -> always true for t>=0.\n      So at t=0: [ -11, 0] -> 0 is covered -> unsafe.\n             t=1: [ -5, 6] -> 0 is covered? yes, because -5<=0<=6 -> unsafe.\n             t=2: [1,12] -> safe.\n      So unsafe at t=0,1.\n\n  Therefore, freeway7 is unsafe at t=0,1,8,9.\n\nFreeway8: same as freeway7? \n  Cars: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6) -> same as freeway7: unsafe at t=0,1,8,9.\n\nNow, freeway1: unsafe at t=16,17,18,19.\nFreeway2,3,4,5: always safe.\nFreeway6: unsafe at t=0. For t>=1, safe.\nFreeway7,8: unsafe at t=0,1,8,9.\n\nWe start at turn0 at y0=0 (safe). We want to be at y=9 at turn H (the beginning of turn H).\n\nWe can only move one step per turn (or stay, but staying doesn't help upward). To go from 0 to 9, we need at least 9 moves upward.\n\nBut we might have to wait at some y (by choosing S) to avoid unsafe times.\n\nWe are to find a path: a sequence of actions (U,D,S) such that:\n\n- The y-coordinate at each turn t (from 0 to H-1) is safe (if y_t is between 1 and 8, then the freeway y_t must be safe at turn t).\n\n- And we end at y_H = 9.\n\nWe can do BFS in the state (t, y): \n  t: the current turn (starting from 0, then 1,2,...)\n  y: the current y-coordinate (0 to 9)\n\nWe start at (0,0) with no actions.\n\nThen we consider the actions: U, D, S.\n\nBut note: we can only move to y in [0,9]. And we want to minimize H (the turn at which we are at y=9).\n\nWe can use a queue for BFS (by time). We want the minimal H.\n\nWe'll mark visited states (t,y) to avoid cycles. But note: we might need to wait arbitrarily? However, since the unsafe times are periodic? Actually, the cars move at constant speed, but the unsafe times are finite intervals. For example, freeway7 is unsafe only at t=0,1,8,9. After that, it becomes safe. Similarly, freeway1 is unsafe only at t=16..19.\n\nBut note: after t=19, freeway1 becomes safe again? Actually, for freeway1: the car moves right. After t=19, the car is at: \n  t=20: [-59+3*20, -48+3*20] = [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12] -> safe.\n\nAnd then it moves further right, so it never comes back. \n\nSimilarly, freeway6: only unsafe at t=0. Then safe for t>=1.\n\nFreeway7: unsafe at t=0,1,8,9. Then after t=9, the first car: unsafe at t=8,9 -> then at t=10: [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12] -> safe. The second car: unsafe at t=0,1 -> then safe for t>=2. So after t=9, freeway7 is safe.\n\nSo we only need to consider a bounded time.\n\nWe'll do BFS until we reach y=9.\n\nSteps:\n\n- Start: state (t=0, y=0) is safe.\n\n- Then we consider t=0: we can choose U, D, S.\n\n  - If we choose U: then we move to y1 = 0+1 = 1 at turn1. But at turn0, we are at y0=0 (safe). Then at turn1 we are at y1=1. Now, freeway1 at turn1: we computed freeway1 unsafe at t=16..19? so at t=1 it is safe? \n        freeway1: car: [-59+3*1, -48+3*1] = [-56, -45] -> which doesn't cover 0 -> safe. \n        So (1,1) is safe.\n\n  - If we choose D: then y1 = 0-1 = -1 -> invalid (y must be in [0,9]). So not allowed.\n\n  - If we choose S: then y1 = 0 -> state (1,0) -> safe.\n\nSo from (0,0): we can go to (1,1) or (1,0).\n\nWe continue.\n\nWe need to check at each state (t,y) we are at, if y is in [1,8] then we check the freeway y at time t: if it is unsafe, then we cannot be there -> we discard the state.\n\nWe are going to build a BFS tree.\n\nWe want to reach a state (t,9) for some t. Then H = t? Because we are at turn t at y=9. And we have taken t actions? \n\nBut note: we start at turn0, then after one action we are at turn1. So to be at turn t, we have taken t actions? \n\nBut the problem says: we are to output a sequence of actions for turns 0 to H-1, and then at turn H we are at 9. \n\nIn our BFS, if we reach (H,9), that means we have taken H actions (from turn0 to turn H-1) and then at turn H we are at 9. \n\nSo the minimal H is the minimal t for which we have a path to (t,9).\n\nWe'll do:\n\n  Let dist[t][y] = the minimal number of actions (or is it the turn? actually, t is the turn) to reach (t,y). Actually, we are doing BFS by time.\n\nWe use a queue: (t, y, path) but we don't store the path in the queue to save memory. Instead, we can store the parent information.\n\nBut we need to output the sequence of actions.\n\nAlternatively, we can store for each state (t,y) the action that led to it and the previous state.\n\nBut the state space: t can go up to ...? Since the unsafe times are up to 19, we can set a bound, say t_max=100.\n\nWe want the minimal H such that we reach (H,9). \n\nSteps:\n\n  Initialize: \n      queue: [(0,0)] \n      parent: a 2D array (for t and y) to store (prev_t, prev_y, action) that led to (t,y). Or we store the action at state (t,y) and the previous state.\n\n  For each state (t,y) popped from the queue:\n      If y==9: then we found H = t. Then we backtrack to get the actions from (0,0) to (t,9).\n\n      Otherwise, for each action a in ['U','D','S']:\n          y_next = y + delta(a)\n          If y_next < 0 or y_next > 9: skip.\n          t_next = t+1   (because we are going to the next turn)\n\n          Then, at state (t_next, y_next): we will be at turn t_next and y_next.\n          But we must check safety at (t_next, y_next) only if y_next is between 1 and 8? \n          However, note: at state (t_next, y_next) we are at turn t_next and at y_next. The collision condition is checked at the beginning of turn t_next: if y_next is between 1 and 8, then we check the freeway y_next at time t_next.\n\n          If y_next is 0 or 9, then no check.\n\n          If the state (t_next, y_next) is safe and not visited, then we push it.\n\n  We break when we find y_next=9.\n\nBut note: we start at (0,0) and then we generate (1,0) and (1,1). Then from (1,0) we can go to (2,0) (by S), (2,1) (by U), but not (2,-1). From (1,1) we can go to (2,0) (D), (2,1) (S), (2,2) (U).\n\nWe need to avoid infinite loops. But since we are bounded in y and we can set a time bound, we can set t_max to, say, 50.\n\nWe'll do BFS until we find the first state at y=9.\n\nNow, we precomputed the unsafe times for each freeway:\n\nFreeway1: unsafe at t in [16,19] -> at other times, safe.\nFreeway2,3,4,5: always safe.\nFreeway6: unsafe at t=0 -> so for t>=1, safe. But at t=0: unsafe. But we are at freeway6 only if y=6. And at turn0, we start at y0=0, so we don't check freeway6 at turn0. However, we might be at freeway6 at a later turn.\n\nBut freeway6: unsafe only at t=0? Then for t>=1, safe.\n\nFreeway7: unsafe at t=0,1,8,9.\nFreeway8: unsafe at t=0,1,8,9.\n\nSo we can write a function is_safe(t, y) that returns True if it is safe to be at freeway y at turn t.\n\ndef is_safe(t, y):\n    if y==0 or y==9:\n        return True   # not a freeway\n    if y==1:\n        # unsafe at t in [16,19] -> 16,17,18,19\n        return t < 16 or t > 19\n    if y in [2,3,4,5]:\n        return True\n    if y==6:\n        return t != 0   # unsafe only at t=0 -> safe for t>=1, but note: if t=0 we return False, else True.\n        # However, if we are at freeway6 at t=0, it would be unsafe. But we start at t0=0 at y0=0, so we won't be at freeway6 at t0. But if we get to freeway6 at a later time, then t>=1 -> safe.\n    if y==7 or y==8:\n        # unsafe at t in {0,1,8,9}\n        return t not in [0,1,8,9]\n\nBut note: for freeway6, we said unsafe at t=0 only. But what if we are at freeway6 at t=0? That would be unsafe. However, we start at t0=0 at y0=0. Then we move at turn0 to some y1 at turn1. So we will never be at freeway6 at turn0. So for freeway6, we can simply say safe for all t? Actually, we can be at freeway6 at turn t only for t>=1, and then it is safe. So we can always say safe for freeway6? \n\nBut let me check: the car on freeway6 at time t: \n   First car: always safe (as above)\n   Second car: unsafe at t=0 -> safe for t>=1.\n\nSo if we are at freeway6 at time t (which must be at least 1), then it is safe.\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\n    if y==6:\n        return True   # because we will never be at freeway6 at t=0? Actually, if we are at freeway6 at t=0, we would be unsafe. But we start at y0=0 at t0=0, and then we move at turn0. So the next time we are at freeway6 is at turn>=1. So we can avoid being at freeway6 at t=0. But our state: at state (t,y) we are at the beginning of turn t. The only way to be at freeway6 at turn0 is if we start there? But we start at y0=0. So we can assume that we are never at freeway6 at t=0. Therefore, we can say freeway6 is safe for all t? \n\nHowever, to be safe, we can do:\n\n    if y==6 and t==0:\n        return False   # because if we were there, we'd be unsafe, but we start at 0 so we won't be. But if we do BFS and we generate (0,6) by some path? We start at (0,0) and we don't move until we take an action. So we won't generate (0,6). \n\nSo we can write:\n\n    if y==1:\n        return t not in [16,17,18,19]\n    if y==7 or y==8:\n        return t not in [0,1,8,9]\n    # for y in [2,3,4,5,6]: \n    return True\n\nBut note: freeway6 is safe for t>=1, but what if t is negative? Not possible. So for freeway6, we can return True for any t? \n\nYes, because at t=0 we won't be there, and for t>=1 it is safe.\n\nSo:\n\ndef is_safe(t, y):\n    if y==0 or y==9:\n        return True\n    if y==1:\n        return t < 16 or t > 19\n    if y==7 or y==8:\n        return t not in [0,1,8,9]\n    # y in {2,3,4,5,6}\n    return True\n\nNow, we simulate:\n\nWe set a time limit, say T_max=50.\n\nWe create a visited set: we can use a 2D array: visited[t][y] for t in [0,50] and y in [0,9]. But we can use a set: (t,y).\n\nSteps:\n\n  from collections import deque\n  queue = deque()\n  queue.append((0,0))   # (t,y) at the beginning of turn0: (0,0)\n  visited = set()\n  visited.add((0,0))\n  parent = {}   # key: (t,y), value: (prev_t, prev_y, action) that led to (t,y)\n\n  while queue:\n      t, y = queue.popleft()\n      if y == 9:\n          H = t   # because at the beginning of turn t we are at y=9.\n          break\n\n      for a in ['U','D','S']:\n          if a=='U':\n              y_next = y+1\n          elif a=='D':\n              y_next = y-1\n          else: # 'S'\n              y_next = y\n\n          if y_next < 0 or y_next > 9:\n              continue\n\n          t_next = t+1\n          # Check safety at (t_next, y_next): \n          if not is_safe(t_next, y_next):\n              continue\n\n          if (t_next, y_next) in visited:\n              continue\n\n          visited.add((t_next, y_next))\n          parent[(t_next, y_next)] = (t, y, a)   # from (t,y) with action a we got to (t_next, y_next)\n          queue.append((t_next, y_next))\n\n  Then backtrack from (H,9) to (0,0) to get the actions.\n\nBut note: the action is taken at the previous state. \n\nExample: we are at state (t,y) and we take action a to go to (t_next, y_next).\n\nThen at turn t, we are at (t,y) and we choose a, and then at turn t_next we are at (t_next, y_next).\n\nSo the action at turn t is a.\n\nThen to output: \n   We want the actions for turns: 0, 1, 2, ..., H-1.\n\n   How to backtrack:\n\n      states: \n          state0: (0,0)\n          state1: (1, y1) -> was generated by (0,0) with action a0.\n          state2: (2, y2) -> generated by (1,y1) with action a1.\n          ...\n          stateH: (H,9) -> generated by (H-1, y_{H-1}) with action a_{H-1}.\n\n      So we need to know the entire path.\n\n      We can store the action that led to (t,y) from the previous state.\n\n      Then we backtrack from (H,9) to (0,0) and then reverse the actions.\n\n  Steps for backtracking:\n\n      actions = []\n      state = (H,9)\n      while state != (0,0):\n          t_cur, y_cur = state\n          # get the parent: (t_prev, y_prev, a_prev) = parent[state]\n          t_prev, y_prev, a_prev = parent[(t_cur, y_cur)]\n          actions.append( (t_prev, a_prev) )   # because at turn t_prev, we did a_prev to get to state (t_cur, y_cur)\n          state = (t_prev, y_prev)\n\n      Then reverse actions? Actually, we are appending from the end. Then we need to reverse to get from turn0 to turn H-1.\n\n      But note: we have the actions for turn0, turn1, ... turn H-1.\n\n      Then we output:\n          Turn 0: a0\n          Turn 1: a1\n          ...\n          Turn H-1: a_{H-1}\n\n      And H is the number of actions? Actually, H is the turn at which we are at 9, and the number of actions is H (since we start at turn0 and then we do H actions to be at turn H).\n\nBut note: we start at turn0 and then we do an action at turn0 to go to turn1, and then ... at turn H-1 we do an action to go to turn H (which is at 9). So the number of actions is H.\n\nNow, we run the BFS.\n\nWe'll code it.\n\nBut we must be cautious: the BFS might not find the minimal H? But since we are going by increasing time, the first time we hit (t,9) is minimal.\n\nLet me try to compute by hand the minimal path.\n\nWe need to go from 0 to 9. Minimal steps: 9 moves upward. So minimal H=9? (then we are at turn9 at y=9). \n\nBut we must avoid unsafe times.\n\nAt turn1: we must be at y1. If we go up, we are at y1=1 at turn1. Freeway1 at turn1: safe (as above).\n\nAt turn2: we can be at y2=2 -> freeway2: always safe.\n\nAt turn3: y3=3 -> safe.\n\nAt turn4: y4=4 -> safe.\n\nAt turn5: y5=5 -> safe.\n\nAt turn6: y6=6 -> freeway6: safe (since t=6>=1).\n\nAt turn7: y7=7 -> freeway7: at t=7 -> is 7 in [0,1,8,9]? no -> safe.\n\nAt turn8: y8=8 -> freeway8: at t=8 -> unsafe (because t=8 is unsafe for freeway8).\n\nSo we cannot be at freeway8 at turn8.\n\nTherefore, we cannot do 8 moves upward to be at y=8 at turn8 and then one more to 9 at turn9? But we are at freeway8 at turn8: unsafe.\n\nSo we must avoid being at freeway8 at turn8.\n\nWhat if we wait at some point?\n\nOption: wait at y=7 at turn7 (by staying) and then at turn8 we are still at y=7. Then at turn8, we are at freeway7? at t=8: freeway7 is unsafe! So we cannot be at freeway7 at turn8.\n\nBut we are at y=7 at turn8: freeway7 at t=8: unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot stay at y=7 at turn7? \n\nAlternatively, we could have slowed down earlier.\n\nOr we could go up to y=7 at a later turn.\n\nBut we are at turn7: we are at y=7. Then we can go down to y=6 at turn8? Then at turn8 we are at freeway6: safe (because freeway6 is always safe for t>=1). Then at turn9, we go up to y=7 again? But then at turn9, we are at freeway7: and t=9 is unsafe for freeway7.\n\nSo we avoid freeway7 at turn9? \n\nAlternatively, we can wait at y=6 for some turns.\n\nBut we want minimal.\n\nAnother idea: avoid being at freeway8 at turn8 and freeway7 at turn8 and turn9.\n\nWe can be at freeway8 only at safe times: t not in [0,1,8,9]. So we can be at freeway8 at turn2,3,4,5,6,7,10,... \n\nSimilarly, freeway7: same unsafe times.\n\nSo we can:\n\n  Plan: \n      We need to be at y=7 at a time when freeway7 is safe -> t not in {0,1,8,9}. So t in {2,3,4,5,6,7,10,...} -> but note: we want minimal turns, so we prefer t=7? But t=7: freeway7 is safe? \n          freeway7: unsafe at t in [0,1,8,9] -> so at t=7, safe.\n\n      Then we need to be at y=8 at a time when freeway8 is safe -> t not in {0,1,8,9} -> so we cannot use t=8. Then next safe time is t=10? \n\n      So: \n          at turn7: we are at y=7 (safe, because t=7 is safe for freeway7).\n          then at turn7 we can choose to go up to y=8 at turn8? but at turn8 we are at freeway8: unsafe -> skip.\n          or we can choose to stay at y=7 at turn8: then at turn8 we are at freeway7: unsafe -> skip.\n          or we can choose to go down to y=6 at turn8: then at turn8 we are at freeway6: safe.\n\n          Then at turn8: we are at y=6.\n          Then we can go up to y=7 at turn9: but at turn9 we are at freeway7: unsafe -> skip.\n          or stay at y=6: safe.\n          or go down to y=5: safe.\n\n          Then at turn9: we are at y=6 (say). Then at turn10: we can go up to y=7: at turn10: freeway7 is safe (because 10 not in {0,1,8,9}).\n          Then at turn10: we are at y=7 (safe). Then at turn11: we can go to y=8: at turn11: freeway8 is safe? 11 not in {0,1,8,9} -> yes.\n          Then at turn12: we go to y=9.\n\n      Total turns: 12.\n\nBut minimal? We can try to avoid the unsafe times by speeding up or slowing down earlier.\n\nAlternatively, we can be at y=7 earlier? \n\nWe can be at y=7 at turn7 (safe). Then instead of going down, we can wait at y=7? But at turn8 we must leave because it becomes unsafe. But we can only go to y=6 or y=8? both unsafe at turn8? \n\nSo we must go down to y=6 at turn8 (to avoid being at freeway7 at turn8, and freeway8 at turn8 is unsafe so we cannot go up). \n\nThen at turn8: we are at y=6 (safe). Then at turn9: we cannot go to y=7 (because freeway7 at turn9 is unsafe). So we must wait at y=6? Then at turn9: we are at y=6 (safe). Then at turn10: go to y=7 (safe). Then at turn11: go to y=8 (safe). Then at turn12: go to y=9.\n\nTotal: 12 turns.\n\nBut can we get to y=7 at a time earlier than 7? \n\nThe minimal time to get to y=7 is 7 moves: at turn7 we are at y=7. But then we are stuck at turn8: we have to go down to y=6 at turn8. \n\nAlternatively, we can slow down earlier: \n\n  For example, we can stay at y=0 at turn0: then at turn1: y0->y1: if we stay at turn0: at turn1 we are at y=0. Then we start moving.\n\n  Or we can go up slowly.\n\nBut that would take more time? \n\nWe can try to be at y=7 at turn10: that would be later.\n\nBut we want minimal.\n\nAnother idea: can we be at y=8 at a safe time? The safe times for freeway8 are t not in {0,1,8,9}. The earliest safe time after 7 is 10? \n\nBut we can be at y=8 at turn2? How? \n\n  turn0: start at 0 -> safe.\n  turn0: choose U -> turn1: y=1 (freeway1 at t=1: safe? yes, because t1=1 not in [16,19])\n  turn1: choose U -> turn2: y=2 (freeway2: safe)\n  turn2: choose U -> turn3: y=3\n  turn3: choose U -> turn4: y=4\n  turn4: choose U -> turn5: y=5\n  turn5: choose U -> turn6: y=6 (freeway6: safe because t=6>=1)\n  turn6: choose U -> turn7: y=7 (freeway7: t=7 -> safe? yes, because 7 not in {0,1,8,9})\n  turn7: choose U -> turn8: y=8 -> but freeway8 at t=8: unsafe -> not allowed.\n\nBut if we go faster? We cannot go faster: we can only move one step per turn.\n\nSo the earliest we can be at y=7 is turn7, and then we have to wait until turn10 to be at y=8? \n\nBut we can be at y=8 at turn7? \n\n  To be at y=8 at turn7, we would have to move 8 steps in 7 moves? That's impossible.\n\nSo we must be at y=8 at turn at least 8? But at turn8, freeway8 is unsafe. So the next safe time is turn10.\n\nTherefore, the minimal time to be at y=8 is turn10? \n\nThen we can be at y=9 at turn11.\n\nBut we can be at y=8 at turn10: then at turn10 we are at y=8 (freeway8: t=10 -> safe). Then at turn11: we go to y=9.\n\nNow, how to get to y=8 at turn10? \n\nWe must be at y=7 at turn9? but freeway7 at turn9 is unsafe. So we cannot be at y=7 at turn9.\n\nAlternatively, we can be at y=7 at turn10? \n\nBut then we are at y=7 at turn10, then at turn11 we go to y=8 (freeway8 at turn11: safe), then turn12 to y=9.\n\nBut we can be at y=8 at turn10: \n\n  To be at y=8 at turn10, we must be at y=7 at turn9? But we cannot because freeway7 at turn9 is unsafe.\n\n  Or we can be at y=7 at turn10? Then we are at y=7 at turn10, then at turn10 we choose U to go to y=8 at turn11. But then we are at y=8 at turn11, not turn10.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=8 at turn10 without being at y=7 at turn9? \n\nBut we cannot be at y=7 at turn9.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being at freeway8 at turn8 and turn9, and freeway7 at turn8 and turn9? \n\nBut we can be at freeway7 at turn7 and then at turn8 we move to freeway6? \n\nThen the path:\n\n  turn0: start at 0 -> safe.\n  turn0: U -> turn1: y=1 (freeway1: t1=1 -> safe)\n  turn1: U -> turn2: y=2\n  turn2: U -> turn3: y=3\n  turn3: U -> turn4: y=4\n  turn4: U -> turn5: y=5\n  turn5: U -> turn6: y=6 (safe)\n  turn6: U -> turn7: y=7 (freeway7: t7=7 -> safe)\n  turn7: D -> turn8: y=6 (freeway6: safe)   [we go down to avoid freeway7 at turn8? but freeway7 at turn8 is unsafe, so we don't want to be there. And freeway8 at turn8 is unsafe, so we cannot go up. So we go down to y=6 at turn8: safe.\n  turn8: S -> turn9: y=6 (safe)   [we could also go up? to y=7? but at turn9, freeway7 is unsafe -> not allowed. So we stay at y=6.\n  turn9: U -> turn10: y=7 (freeway7: t10=10 -> safe)\n  turn10: U -> turn11: y=8 (freeway8: t11=11 -> safe? 11 not in [0,1,8,9] -> yes)\n  turn11: U -> turn12: y=9\n\nTotal turns: 12.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nWhat if we don't go down at turn7, but we slow down earlier?\n\nFor example, at turn6: we are at y=6. Instead of going up to y=7 at turn7, we stay at y=6 at turn7. Then at turn7, we are at y=6 (safe). Then at turn8: we go up to y=7: but freeway7 at turn8 is unsafe -> not allowed.\n\nAt turn6: we go down to y=5 at turn7? Then we are at freeway5: safe. Then at turn8: we can go up to y=6 (safe). Then turn9: go to y=7? but freeway7 at turn9 unsafe -> not allowed. Then we have to wait until turn10 to go to y=7, then turn11 to y=8, turn12 to y=9 -> same.\n\nAlternatively, we can be at y=7 at turn10 by:\n\n  turn0: U (1)\n  turn1: U (2)\n  turn2: U (3)\n  turn3: U (4)\n  turn4: U (5)\n  turn5: U (6)\n  turn6: S (6)   # wait at y=6 for one turn\n  turn7: U (7)   # then at turn8 we would be at y=7? but freeway7 at turn8: unsafe -> skip.\n  turn7: we cannot go up.\n\n  So we do:\n      turn6: S -> turn7: y=6\n      turn7: S -> turn8: y=6\n      turn8: U -> turn9: y=7 -> unsafe? freeway7 at t9: unsafe -> not allowed.\n\n  So we have to wait until turn9: then at turn9: we are at y=6, and then at turn10: we go to y=7 (safe).\n\n  Then turn10: U -> y=8 at turn11 (safe)\n  turn11: U -> y=9 at turn12.\n\n  Still 12.\n\nBut what if we go faster initially? We can only move one step per turn.\n\nOr if we go down at some point to avoid an unsafe time? \n\nFor example, after turn6 (at y=6), we go down to y=5 at turn7. Then we have more flexibility? \n\n  turn7: at y=5 (safe)\n  turn7: U -> turn8: y=6 (safe)\n  turn8: U -> turn9: y=7 (unsafe) -> not allowed.\n\n  turn8: S -> y=6 at turn9 (safe)\n  turn9: U -> y=7 at turn10 (safe)\n  turn10: U -> y=8 at turn11 (safe)\n  turn11: U -> y=9 at turn12.\n\n  Still 12.\n\nIs there a path that takes 11 turns? \n\n  We would be at y=9 at turn11.\n\n  To be at y=9 at turn11, we must be at y=8 at turn10 (because we move one step at a time).\n\n  So we must be at freeway8 at turn10: safe? yes.\n\n  Then we must be at y=8 at turn10: so we were at y=7 at turn9.\n\n  But freeway7 at turn9: unsafe. \n\n  Therefore, we cannot be at y=7 at turn9.\n\n  So there is no path with H=11.\n\nSimilarly, for H=10: we must be at y=9 at turn10 -> we must be at y=8 at turn9 -> freeway8 at turn9: unsafe.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=12.\n\nNow, we need to output the sequence for turns 0 to 11.\n\nOne possible sequence:\n\n  turn0: U  -> y1=1\n  turn1: U  -> y2=2\n  turn2: U  -> y3=3\n  turn3: U  -> y4=4\n  turn4: U  -> y5=5\n  turn5: U  -> y6=6\n  turn6: U  -> y7=7\n  turn7: D  -> y8=6   (from 7 down to 6)\n  turn8: S  -> y9=6   (stay)\n  turn9: U  -> y10=7\n  turn10: U -> y11=8\n  turn11: U -> y12=9\n\nBut wait: at turn7: we do D -> then at turn8 we are at y=6. Then at turn8: we do S -> at turn9 we are at y=6. Then turn9: U -> at turn10 we are at y=7.\n\nBut we could do at turn8: U? Then at turn9 we would be at y=7 -> unsafe. So we must do S or D. \n\nBut we did S.\n\nAlternatively, we could do:\n\n  turn0: U\n  turn1: U\n  turn2: U\n  turn3: U\n  turn4: U\n  turn5: U\n  turn6: U\n  turn7: D   -> to 6\n  turn8: D   -> to 5? then turn9: U to 6, turn10: U to 7, turn11: U to 8, turn12: U to 9 -> 13 turns, worse.\n\nSo the above sequence is minimal.\n\nBut note: at turn7: we are at y=7 (safe). Then we do D to go to y=6 at turn8. At turn8, we are at y=6: safe. Then we do S at turn8: then at turn9 we are at y=6: safe. Then at turn9: U to y=7 at turn10: safe. Then U to y=8 at turn11: safe. Then U to y=9 at turn12.\n\nSo the actions for turn0 to turn11:\n\n  Turn0: U\n  Turn1: U\n  Turn2: U\n  Turn3: U\n  Turn4: U\n  Turn5: U\n  Turn6: U\n  Turn7: D\n  Turn8: S\n  Turn9: U\n  Turn10: U\n  Turn11: U\n\nWe output:\n\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 1: U\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: D\nTurn 8: S\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n\nBut wait, the last action is at turn11, and then at turn12 we are at 9. And the minimal number of turns H=12.\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence has H actions? \n\nYes, we have 12 actions (from turn0 to turn11) and then we are at turn12 at y=9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then we have H=12, so t from 0 to 11.\n\nSo we output 12 lines.\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", and we found H=12.\n\nNow, we must verify safety:\n\n  Turn0: we are at (0,0) -> safe (not freeway).\n  Action: U -> then at turn1 we are at (0,1).\n\n  Turn1: y=1 (freeway1): t=1 -> is safe? (t=1 not in [16,19]) -> safe.\n  Action: U -> turn2: y=2.\n\n  Turn2: y=2 -> safe (freeway2 always safe).\n  Action: U -> y=3.\n\n  ... \n\n  Turn6: y=6 (freeway6): t=6 -> safe (freeway6 safe for t>=1).\n  Action: U -> y=7 at turn7.\n\n  Turn7: y=7 (freeway7): t=7 -> safe? (t=7 not in [0,1,8,9]) -> safe.\n  Action: D -> then at turn8: y=6.\n\n  Turn8: y=6 (freeway6): safe.\n  Action: S -> then at turn9: y=6.\n\n  Turn9: y=6: safe.\n  Action: U -> turn10: y=7.\n\n  Turn10: y=7 (freeway7): t=10 -> safe (not in unsafe set).\n  Action: U -> turn11: y=8.\n\n  Turn11: y=8 (freeway8): t=11 -> safe (not in [0,1,8,9]).\n  Action: U -> turn12: y=9.\n\n  At turn12: we are at y=9, done.\n\nAll safe.\n\nSo we output the sequence.\n\nBut note: the problem says the initial turn is t1=0, and we output:\n\n  Turn 0: U\n  Turn 1: U\n  ...\n  Turn 11: U\n\nNow, we write the answer.\n\nBut the problem says: the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 0: U\nTurn 1: U\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: D\nTurn 8: S\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and t1=0.\n\nSo we output exactly as above.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? We argued that 12 is minimal.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to be at y=8 at turn10 without being at y=7 at turn9? \n\nBut we must be at y=7 at turn9 to be at y=8 at turn10? \n\nUnless we jump? but we can only move one step per turn.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, the answer.\n\nWe can run the BFS to confirm. We set T_max=20.\n\nBut we already did.\n\nSo final answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) is 12, starting from turn \\(t_1 = 0\\) at position \\((0, 0)\\). The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by moving upward quickly to \\(y = 7\\) by turn 7, then moving down to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 8 to avoid the unsafe freeway 7 and 8 at turns 8 and 9, staying at \\(y = 6\\) for turn 9, and then moving upward to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 10, \\(y = 8\\) at turn 11, and finally \\(y = 9\\) at turn 12.\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n- At turn 0, move up (U) to \\(y = 1\\).\n- At turn 1, move up (U) to \\(y = 2\\).\n- At turn 2, move up (U) to \\(y = 3\\).\n- At turn 3, move up (U) to \\(y = 4\\).\n- At turn 4, move up (U) to \\(y = 5\\).\n- At turn 5, move up (U) to \\(y = 6\\).\n- At turn 6, move up (U) to \\(y = 7\\).\n- At turn 7, move down (D) to \\(y = 6\\) to avoid unsafe freeways at turn 8.\n- At turn 8, stay (S) at \\(y = 6\\) to avoid unsafe freeways at turn 9.\n- At turn 9, move up (U) to \\(y = 7\\) (now safe at turn 10).\n- At turn 10, move up (U) to \\(y = 8\\) (now safe at turn 11).\n- At turn 11, move up (U) to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 12.\n\nThis sequence ensures safety at each turn:\n- Turns 0: at \\(y = 0\\) (safe, not a freeway).\n- Turn 1: at \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1 safe at \\(t = 1\\)).\n- Turn 2: at \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2 always safe).\n- Turn 3: at \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3 always safe).\n- Turn 4: at \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4 always safe).\n- Turn 5: at \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5 always safe).\n- Turn 6: at \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6 safe at \\(t = 6\\)).\n- Turn 7: at \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7 safe at \\(t = 7\\)).\n- Turn 8: at \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6 safe at \\(t = 8\\)).\n- Turn 9: at \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6 safe at \\(t = 9\\)).\n- Turn 10: at \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7 safe at \\(t = 10\\)).\n- Turn 11: at \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8 safe at \\(t = 11\\)).\n\nThe final position \\((0, 9)\\) is reached at turn 12.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 0:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 1:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 2:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 3:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 4:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 5:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 6:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7:  D \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8:  S \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9:  U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}",

The current turn is t_1 = 3, and I'm starting at y=3.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the cars move. Each car has a head, tail, direction, and speed. The direction tells us if it's left-moving or right-moving, but in the update rules, left-moving cars decrease their position, and right-moving increase. In the car state, for freeway 1, it's (-39, -50, right, 3). Since it's right-moving, the head should be larger than the tail? But here head is -39 and tail is -50, which is less, so that might be a mistake or perhaps it's defined differently.\n\nLet me read the car update rules carefully.\n\nFor a right-moving car: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nIt says for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] with τ and h, and it moves to [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] where Δt = T - t_1.\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction, speed) = (-39, -50, right, 3). But for right-moving, if τ is tail and h is head, and it's moving right, head should be greater than tail. Here, h = -39, τ = -50, so τ < h, which is consistent since -50 < -39, so Span is [τ, h] = [-50, -39], I think. Let's clarify the notation.\n\nThe car state says: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nSince it's [τ, h] and τ < h for right-moving, as position increases.\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nFor left-moving, [h, τ] with h > τ, since head is left or something? Let's see.\n\nIn left-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [h, τ], and it moves to [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt], so if h and τ are positions, and it's decreasing, so h should be greater than τ for left-moving? I'm getting confused.\n\nPerhaps I should think in terms of the position.\n\nLet me define the span based on direction.\n\nFor a car, at time t, the span covers from min position to max position.\n\nBut in the update, it's given with head and tail, which might be the front and back.\n\nFor right-moving car, head is the front, so head > tail, and span is [tail, head].\n\nFor left-moving car, head is the front, but since it's moving left, head < tail? No.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nThe problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nAnd for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor right-moving, since span is [τ, h] and it increases, so τ should be less than h.\n\nFor left-moving, span is [h, τ] and it decreases, so h should be greater than τ, meaning head is at higher position, moving left.\n\nIn the data, all cars are right-moving, I think. Let's see the directions.\n\nFreeway 1: (-39, -50, right, 3) so head h = -39, tail τ = -50, since right, τ = -50 < h = -39, so span at t_1=3 is [τ, h] = [-50, -39]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (-36, -47, right, 12) so [ -47, -36 ]\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2? (-36, -47, right, 12), same as freeway 2?\n\nLet's list all:\n\nFreeway k | Cars\n\n1 | (-39, -50, right, 3)  → span [ -50, -39 ]\n\n2 | (-36, -47, right, 12) → span [ -47, -36 ]\n\n3 | (-36, -47, right, 12) → same as 2? [ -47, -36 ]\n\n4 | (-36, -47, right, 12) → [ -47, -36 ]\n\n5 | (-36, -47, right, 12) → [ -47, -36 ]\n\n6 | (-36, -47, right, 12), (36, 25, right, 12) → first car [ -47, -36 ], second car (36,25,right,12) so head 36, tail 25, since right, τ=25, h=36, so span [25,36]\n\n7 | (-30, -41, right, 6), (18,7,right,6) → first car: h=-30, τ=-41? tail τ=-41, head h=-30, so span [ -41, -30 ]? But direction right, so [τ, h] = [-41, -30]\n\nSecond car: (18,7,right,6) so [7,18]\n\n8 | (-30, -41, right, 6), (18,7,right,6) → same as 7, [ -41, -30 ] and [7,18]\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, the player is at position x=0, y=y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in Span(T) for that car.\n\nAlso, note that when you move to a new y, you are not on that freeway until the next turn, so you only care about the freeway you are currently on at that turn.\n\nAt turn T, you are at position (0, y_T), and you will collide if for freeway y_T, there is a car with 0 in its span at time T.\n\nThe action at turn T determines y_{T+1}, so at turn T, you are on y_T, and you choose a_t to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nFor collision at turn T, it depends on y_T and the car spans at time T for freeway y_T.\n\nThe player position at turn T is (0, y_T), and collision happens if 0 is in the span of any car on freeway y_T at time T.\n\nNow, I need to get from y=3 at t=3 to y=9 at some turn T, with minimal turns.\n\nSince y=9 is the goal, and no cars on y=9 I assume, since freeways are y=1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 are probably safe, but the vertical axis is y=0 to 9, and freeways y=1 to 8 have cars, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe zones, no cars.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), so once we are at y=9, we are done.\n\nNow, at turn t=3, y=3.\n\nI need to find actions for turns starting from t=3.\n\nLet me denote the time from t=3 onwards.\n\nSet τ = t - t_1 = t - 3, so at τ=0, t=3, y=3.\n\nThen at each step, I choose action U, D, or S, which changes y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nBut I have to avoid being on a freeway y=1 to 8 when there is a car at x=0 at that time.\n\nFirst, I need to compute for each freeway and each time, whether x=0 is occupied or not.\n\nSince the cars are moving, their spans change with time.\n\nLet me define the span for each car at time T, where T is absolute time, t_1=3.\n\nSo for a car, at time T, the span depends on s and direction.\n\nAll cars here are right-moving, so for each car, span at time T is [τ + s(T-3), h + s(T-3)] for a car with initial τ and h at t=3.\n\nIn the state, at t=3, for each car, we have head and tail, so we can compute the position.\n\nLet me list all cars per freeway with their spans at t=3.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, span [ -50, -39 ] at t=3\n\nFreeway 2: one car, [ -47, -36 ] at t=3\n\nFreeway 3: one car, [ -47, -36 ] at t=3\n\nFreeway 4: one car, [ -47, -36 ] at t=3\n\nFreeway 5: one car, [ -47, -36 ] at t=3\n\nFreeway 6: two cars, first [ -47, -36 ], second [25,36] at t=3? For second car, (36,25,right,12), so head=36, tail=25, so since right, span [τ,h] = [25,36]\n\nFreeway 7: two cars, first: (-30,-41,right,6) so h=-30, τ=-41, span [ -41, -30 ]\n\nSecond: (18,7,right,6) span [7,18]\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7, [ -41, -30 ] and [7,18]\n\nNow, for each freeway, at time T, we need to know if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nThat is, for a given y and T, if y between 1 and 8, and 0 is within the span of a car on y at time T.\n\nSince multiple cars per freeway, but for collision, if any car has 0 in span.\n\nNow, for freeway y, at time T, the cars present are as above.\n\nLet me compute for each freeway the times when 0 is occupied.\n\nFirst, for a car with initial span [L, R] at t=3, right-moving, speed s, so at time T, span [L + s(T-3), R + s(T-3)]\n\n0 is in span if L + s(T-3) <= 0 <= R + s(T-3)\n\nSimilarly for other cars.\n\nSince all right-moving, same formula.\n\nNow, let's go freeway by freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, L = -50, R = -39, s=3\n\nAt time T, span [ -50 + 3(T-3), -39 + 3(T-3) ]\n\n0 in span if -50 + 3(T-3) <= 0 <= -39 + 3(T-3)\n\nLet Δt = T-3, so 0 <= Δt\n\nThen -50 + 3Δt <= 0 <= -39 + 3Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -50 + 3Δt <= 0 => 3Δt <= 50 => Δt <= 50/3 ≈ 16.666, so Δt <= 16\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -39 + 3Δt => 3Δt >= 39 => Δt >= 13\n\nSo for Δt from 13 to 16 inclusive, 0 in span.\n\nT from 3+13=16 to 3+16=19.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: car with L=-47, R=-36, s=12\n\n[ -47 + 12Δt, -36 + 12Δt ]\n\n0 in span: -47 + 12Δt <= 0 <= -36 + 12Δt\n\nFirst: -47 + 12Δt <= 0 => 12Δt <= 47 => Δt <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916, so Δt <= 3\n\nSecond: 0 <= -36 + 12Δt => 12Δt >= 36 => Δt >= 3\n\nSo Δt >=3 and Δt <=3, so only at Δt=3, T=6.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, since same car? Freeway 3 has same parameters: (-36,-47,right,12), so L=-47, R=-36, s=12, same as freeway 2.\n\nSo also only at Δt=3, T=6.\n\nFreeway 4: same, only at T=6.\n\nFreeway 5: same, only at T=6.\n\nNow freeway 6: two cars.\n\nFirst car: same as above? (-36,-47,right,12), so L=-47, R=-36, s=12, same as before, so 0 in span only at Δt=3, T=6.\n\nSecond car: (36,25,right,12), head=36, tail=25, so for right-moving, span [τ,h] = [25,36] at t=3.\n\ns=12, so at T, span [25 + 12Δt, 36 + 12Δt]\n\n0 in span: 25 + 12Δt <= 0 <= 36 + 12Δt\n\nBut 25 + 12Δt <=0? 12Δt <= -25, since Δt >=0, this is impossible because left side positive.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= 36 + 12Δt always true for Δt>=0, but the first inequality 25+12Δt <=0 impossible, so 0 never in span for this car.\n\nSo for freeway 6, only the first car matters, and only at T=6, 0 occupied.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-30,-41,right,6), so h=-30, τ=-41, span [ -41, -30 ] at t=3, s=6\n\nAt T, [ -41 + 6Δt, -30 + 6Δt ]\n\n0 in span: -41 + 6Δt <= 0 <= -30 + 6Δt\n\nFirst: -41 + 6Δt <=0 => 6Δt <=41 => Δt <= 41/6 ≈6.833, so Δt <=6\n\nSecond: 0 <= -30 + 6Δt => 6Δt >=30 => Δt >=5\n\nSo Δt from 5 to 6 inclusive, T from 8 to 9.\n\nSecond car: (18,7,right,6), span [7,18] at t=3, s=6\n\nAt T, [7 + 6Δt, 18 + 6Δt]\n\n0 in span: 7 + 6Δt <= 0 <= 18 + 6Δt\n\n7 + 6Δt <=0? 6Δt <= -7, impossible for Δt>=0.\n\nSo 0 never in span.\n\nThus for freeway 7, only first car matters, occupied at T=8 and T=9 (Δt=5 and 6)\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same as freeway 7, occupied at T=8 and T=9.\n\nNow, freeway 3,4,5 all occupied only at T=6.\n\nBut freeway 2 also at T=6.\n\nAnd freeway 1 occupied from T=16 to 19, but that might be later.\n\nNow, the player starts at t=3, y=3.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns: since y=3 to y=9, difference 6, so if I go up every turn, I can reach in 6 turns: at t=3, y=3; t=4, y=4; ... t=9, y=9.\n\nBut I need to check if I can be on each y at the required time without collision.\n\nAt each turn T, when I am on y_T, it must not be occupied.\n\nFor example, if I go straight up:\n\nAt t=3, y=3. Freeway 3 is occupied? At t=3, Δt=0.\n\nFor freeway 3, at t=3, span [ -47, -36], 0 is not between -47 and -36, since 0 > -36? -36 is negative, 0 is greater, so 0 not in [-47,-36], so at t=3, freeway 3 is not occupied. Similarly, all freeways at t=3: let's check.\n\nAt t=3, Δt=0.\n\nFreeway 1: [ -50, -39], 0 not in.\n\nFreeway 2: [ -47, -36], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly all others: freeway 6 has [ -47,-36] and [25,36], 0 not in either.\n\nFreeway 7: [ -41,-30] and [7,18], 0 not in.\n\nSo at t=3, y=3 is safe.\n\nNow, if I go up each turn:\n\nt=3: y=3, safe as above.\n\nAction U to y=4 at t=4.\n\nt=4: y=4, need to check freeway 4 at t=4.\n\nFreeway 4 has car with s=12, at t=4, Δt=1.\n\nSpan: L + sΔt = -47 +12*1 = -35, R + s*1 = -36 +12? R = -36 at t=3, so at t=4, [ -47 +12, -36 +12] = [-35, -24]\n\n0 in? -35 <=0<= -24? 0 <= -24 false, since -24 negative, so no.\n\nSimilarly, t=5: y=5, freeway 5 at t=5, Δt=2.\n\nSpan: [-47 +24, -36 +24] = [-23, -12], 0 not in.\n\nt=6: y=6, freeway 6 at t=6.\n\nFreeway 6 has two cars, but first car: at t=6, Δt=3, span [-47 + 36, -36 + 36] = [ -11, 0 ]? -47 + 36 = -11, -36 + 36 =0.\n\nSo span [-11, 0], so 0 is included, since right end is 0.\n\n0 <= 0 is true, and -11 <=0 true, so yes, 0 in span.\n\nThus at t=6, freeway 6 is occupied, so if I am on y=6 at t=6, I collide.\n\nBut in the path, at t=6, I would be on y=6 if I went up from t=5 y=5.\n\nt=5: y=5, t=6: y=6 after action.\n\nAt turn t=6, I am at position (0, y=6), and freeway 6 has a car with span including 0, so collision.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be on y=6 at t=6.\n\nSo the straight up path collides at t=6.\n\nI need to avoid that.\n\nPerhaps I can delay or something.\n\nMaybe go down first or stay, but I need to minimize turns, so going down might not help.\n\nSince freeway 6 is only occupied at t=6, if I can be on y=6 at another time, or skip it.\n\nBut I have to pass through y=6 to go to y=7, etc.\n\nUnless I go directly, but I can only change by 1 each turn.\n\nSo I must be on each y at some point.\n\nBut I can be on y=6 at a different time.\n\nFor example, if I stay at some y for a turn, or go down and up.\n\nBut that increases H.\n\nSince the goal is to minimize H, the number of turns, I should go up as much as possible, but avoid the collision times.\n\nNow, the dangerous times are:\n\nFor each freeway, when it is occupied at x=0.\n\nFrom above:\n\ny=1: occupied T=16,17,18,19 (from Δt=13 to16)\n\ny=2: occupied only T=6\n\ny=3: occupied only T=6\n\ny=4: occupied only T=6\n\ny=5: occupied only T=6\n\ny=6: occupied only T=6 (since only at that time)\n\ny=7: occupied T=8 and T=9\n\ny=8: occupied T=8 and T=9\n\ny=1 is occupied later, but since we start from y=3 and go up, y=1 might not be relevant unless we go down, but we don't want to.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 is safe.\n\nNow, the critical point is that at T=6, y=2,3,4,5,6 are all occupied? Let's see.\n\ny=2 at T=6: freeway 2 occupied, yes.\n\ny=3 at T=6: freeway 3 occupied, yes.\n\ny=4 at T=6: freeway 4 occupied.\n\ny=5 at T=6: freeway 5 occupied.\n\ny=6 at T=6: freeway 6 occupied.\n\nSo at t=6, all freeways from y=2 to y=6 are occupied! So I cannot be on any of them at t=6.\n\nAdditionally, y=7 and y=8 are occupied at t=8 and t=9.\n\nBut y=7 and y=8 not at t=6.\n\nNow, I start at t=3, y=3.\n\nAt t=3, y=3 is safe, as we saw.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe shortest path would be to go up to y=9 in 6 steps: t=3 y=3, t=4 y=4, t=5 y=5, t=6 y=6? But y=6 at t=6 is occupied, collision.\n\nt=7 y=7, but t=7: need to check y=7 at t=7.\n\nFreeway 7: occupied at T=8 and 9, not at t=7.\n\nAt t=7, Δt=4.\n\nFreeway 7: first car span [ -41 +6*4, -30 +6*4] = [-41+24, -30+24] = [-17, -6], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car [7+24,18+24]= [31,42], 0 not in. So safe.\n\nt=8 y=8, but at t=8, freeway 8 occupied? Freeway 8 same as 7, at t=8 Δt=5, span [ -41 +30, -30+30] = [-11,0]? -41+30=-11, -30+30=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 in span, occupied.\n\nSimilarly, t=9 y=9, but y=9 is goal, no freeway, safe.\n\nBut at t=8, if I am on y=8, it is occupied.\n\nIn the straight path: after t=6 collision, but we avoid t=6.\n\nBut even if I skip t=6, I need to be at y=6 at some other time.\n\nPerhaps I can go slower or faster.\n\nSince at t=6, all y=2-6 are occupied, I need to not be on those y at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, at t=8 and t=9, y=7 and y=8 are occupied.\n\nt=9 y=8 occupied, but if I reach y=9 at t=9, I am not on y=8 at t=9.\n\nLet's list the safe times for each y.\n\nFor y=1: safe except T=16,17,18,19. But since we start from y=3 and go up, probably not relevant.\n\ny=2: safe except T=6\n\ny=3: safe except T=6\n\ny=4: safe except T=6\n\ny=5: safe except T=6\n\ny=6: safe except T=6\n\ny=7: safe except T=8 and T=9\n\ny=8: safe except T=8 and T=9\n\ny=9: always safe\n\nI need to have a sequence of y positions from t=3 onwards, with y_{t+1} = y_t + delta, delta in {-1,0,1}, start y=3 at t=3, end at some t when y=9.\n\nMinimize t - 3, the number of steps.\n\nSince y from 3 to 9, min steps is 6, but as we saw, at t=6, y=6 must be avoided, but in min path, at t=6, if I were at y=6, it's bad.\n\nBut I could be at different y at t=6.\n\nFor example, at t=6, since all y=2-6 are occupied, I need to be at y=0,1,7,8, or 9.\n\nBut y=0 or1 might not be desirable.\n\ny=7 at t=6: is it safe? Freeway 7 at t=6: Δt=3, span [ -41+18, -30+18] = [-23, -12], 0 not in; second car [7+18,18+18]=[25,36], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8 at t=6: freeway 8 same, safe.\n\ny=9 at t=6, safe but too early? y=9 is goal.\n\nBut at t=3, y=3, to y=9 at t=6, I need to go up 3 times, but y from 3 to 9 is 6 steps, so impossible in 3 steps.\n\nMin steps is 6, but with collision.\n\nSo I need to take more than 6 steps.\n\nPerhaps I can stay at some y for a turn or go down.\n\nBut that increases H.\n\nNow, the constraints: at t=6, I cannot be on y=2,3,4,5,6.\n\nSo possible positions at t=6: y=0,1,7,8,9.\n\nBut y=0 or1: y=1 at t=6 is safe? Freeway 1 at t=6: Δt=3, span [-50+9, -39+9] = [-41,-30], 0 not in, so safe, but y=1 is freeway, but at t=6 it is not occupied, so I can be there.\n\nSimilarly y=0 safe.\n\nBut if I go to y=0 or1, I have to come back, which takes more steps.\n\ny=7 or8 at t=6 is possible if I go faster.\n\nSimilarly, at t=8 and t=9, y=7 and y=8 are occupied, so I cannot be on y=7 or y=8 at t=8 or t=9.\n\nSpecifically, at t=8, y=7 occupied, y=8 occupied.\n\nAt t=9, y=7 occupied, y=8 occupied.\n\nBut y=9 at t=9 is safe.\n\nSo for y=7, I cannot be on it at t=8 or t=9.\n\nSimilarly y=8 at t=8 or t=9.\n\nBut other times are safe.\n\nNow, to minimize H, I should go up as fast as possible but avoid the bad times.\n\nSince at t=6, I need to be not on y=2-6, so I should be on y=7 or 8 at t=6, but at t=6, y=7 or 8 is safe, as above.\n\nThen from there go to y=9.\n\nBut at t=6, if I am at y=7, then I can go to y=8 at t=7, y=9 at t=8.\n\nBut at t=8, y=8 is occupied, so if I am on y=8 at t=8, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=9 at t=8, but at t=8, when I am at (0, y=8), it is occupied.\n\nLet's sequence.\n\nStart t=3, y=3.\n\nI need to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nIf I go up faster to be at higher y at t=6.\n\nFor example, from t=3 to t=6, I have 3 steps: at t=3,4,5 actions.\n\nEach action U increases y by 1.\n\nSo in 3 steps, I can increase y by 3, from 3 to 6, but at t=6 y=6 is bad.\n\nOr I can increase by less.\n\nMax I can be at y=6 at t=6, but bad.\n\nI can be at y=7 at t=6 if I go up faster, but I can only go up one per turn, so from y=3 at t=3, after one step t=4 y=4, t=5 y=5, t=6 y=6, cannot be y=7 at t=6, because only +1 per turn.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + delta y_t, with |delta| <=1, so in three steps from t=3 to t=6, y can go from 3 to between 0 and 6, min 0, max 6.\n\nSo at t=6, y can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\nBut y=2,3,4,5,6 all occupied at t=6, so only possible safe y at t=6 are y=0 or y=1.\n\ny=0 or 1 at t=6 is safe.\n\nBut if I go to y=0 or 1, I need to come back up, which will take more turns.\n\nFor example, suppose at t=6 I am at y=1.\n\nThen from there to y=9, I need at least 8 more steps? y=1 to y=9 is 8 steps, so total from t=3 to t=6 is 3 steps, then to y=9 min 8 steps, total 11 steps, but at t=14 or something, which might be worse.\n\nBut I need to check the other constraints.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=7 or 8 at t=6, but I cannot, because max y at t=6 is 6.\n\nUnless I start from lower, but I start from y=3.\n\nAnother idea: since at t=6 is bad for y=2-6, I can avoid being on those y at t=6 by being at different y earlier or later.\n\nFor example, I can stay at y=3 for one turn or something.\n\nLet me list the actions from t=3.\n\nSet τ = t - 3, so at τ=0, t=3, y=3.\n\nI need y_H = 9 for some H.\n\nMin H.\n\ny_{τ} for τ=0,1,2,... with y_0=3.\n\ny_{k+1} = y_k + a_k, with a_k = U: +1, D: -1, S:0.\n\nConstraints: for each k, at time t=3+k, position y_k, if y_k between 1 and 8, then it must not be occupied, i.e., not at the bad times for that y.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nFor y=2,3,4,5,6: bad only at k such that t=3+k=6, so k=3 (since τ=k, t=3+τ, τ=k).\n\nτ = t - t_1 = t - 3.\n\nAt step τ, time t=3+τ.\n\ny at τ is y_τ.\n\nFor freeway y_τ, at time t=3+τ, if y_τ in 1-8, must not be occupied at that time.\n\nOccupied when:\n\nFor y=2: occupied when t=6, so τ=3\n\nSimilarly y=3: occupied at τ=3\n\ny=4: at τ=3\n\ny=5: at τ=3\n\ny=6: at τ=3\n\ny=7: occupied when t=8 or 9, so τ=5 or 6 (t=3+5=8, 3+6=9)\n\ny=8: occupied at τ=5 or 6\n\ny=1: occupied at τ=13,14,15,16, but probably not relevant.\n\nNow, at τ=3, for y_3, if y_3 is between 2 and 6, it is occupied, so I must have y_3 not in {2,3,4,5,6}, so y_3 = 0 or 1 or 7 or 8 or 9.\n\nBut at τ=3, t=6, y_3 cannot be 7,8,9 because max from y_0=3 in 3 steps is y_3=6.\n\nMin y_3=0.\n\nSo possible y_3 = 0 or 1.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=5 and τ=6, for y_5 and y_6, if they are 7 or 8, it is occupied.\n\nSo I need that at τ=5, if y_5=7 or 8, occupied, so must not be 7 or 8 at τ=5.\n\nSimilarly at τ=6, must not be 7 or 8.\n\nBut at τ=6, if y_6=9, it is safe.\n\nNow, I need to reach y_H=9 for some H.\n\nMin H.\n\nSince I have to go from y=3 to y=9, min 6 steps, but with constraints.\n\nIf I can reach y=9 by τ=5, t=8, y=9 at τ=5? y_0=3, at τ=5, y=9, so in 5 steps, increase by 6, impossible, max increase 5 in 5 steps, to y=8.\n\nSimilarly, min H=6, but with collision at τ=3 if y_3=6.\n\nSo H must be at least 7.\n\nCan I do H=7?\n\nWith 7 steps, from y=3 to y=9, net increase 6, so I need to have +1 six times and one S or D, but S or D would mean less increase, so to have net +6 in 7 steps, I must have six U and one S, or five U and two something, but net +6, so number of U minus number of D must be 6, and S has no change.\n\nLet u be number of U, d number of D, s number of S, then u + d + s = H, and u - d = 6, since start y=3, end y=9.\n\nAlso y must be between 0 and 9 at all times.\n\nFrom u - d =6, and u + d + s = H, so 2u + s = H + 6, since u - d =6, u + d + s = H, add: 2u + s = H +6.\n\nSimilarly, subtract: 2d + s = H -6.\n\nNow for H=7, 2u + s = 7+6=13, and u + d + s =7, u - d =6.\n\nThen from u - d =6, u + d + s =7, add: 2u + s =13, which matches.\n\nNow 2u + s =13, u + d + s =7, u - d =6.\n\nFrom u - d =6 and u + d + s =7, subtract: (u + d + s) - (u - d) =7-6 => 2d + s =1.\n\nSince d and s non-negative integers, 2d + s =1, so possible d=0, s=1 or d=1, s=-1 impossible, so d=0, s=1, then u=6.\n\nSo for H=7, must have 6 U, 0 D, 1 S.\n\nSimilarly, for H=6, 2u + s =12, u + d + s =6, u - d =6, then add: 2u + s =12, subtract: 2d + s =0, so d=0,s=0,u=6, but we saw collision.\n\nNow with H=7, I have one stay, so I can avoid being at y=6 at τ=3.\n\nτ=3 is t=6.\n\nI need to not be at y=2-6 at τ=3.\n\nSince I have one stay, I can be at, say, y=5 at τ=2 and τ=3, or something.\n\nLet me define the sequence.\n\nSet y_τ for τ=0 to 6, with y_7=9 for H=7? H is the number of actions from τ=0 to τ=H-1, and after H actions, at time t=3+H, y_H=9.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt time t, before action, position is (0, y_t), then I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nIn terms of turns.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t, choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + delta y.\n\nCollision at turn t if on freeway y_t and occupied at time t.\n\nThen at some turn T, I have y_T =9.\n\nStart at t=3, y=3.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t=3+H, I have y_{3+H} =9.\n\nThe actions are from t=3 to t=3+H-1.\n\nFor example, after 0 actions, at t=3, y=3.\n\nAfter 1 action, at t=4, y=4 if U, etc.\n\nAfter H actions, at t=3+H, y=9.\n\nThe number of turns from start to finish is H, meaning I perform H actions to reach.\n\nIn the sequence, I need actions for t=3 to t=3+H-1, and at t=3+H, y=9.\n\nMin H such that I can achieve y_{3+H}=9.\n\nWith H actions.\n\nFor H=6: actions at t=3,4,5,6,7,8? Let's index.\n\nSet t from 3.\n\nAt t=3, y=3, perform a_3, then y_4 = y_3 + delta\n\n...\n\nAt t=3, perform a_3, y_4\n\nt=4, perform a_4, y_5\n\n...\n\nt=3+H-1, perform a_{3+H-1}, then y_{3+H} = y_{3+H-1} + delta.\n\nAnd we want y_{3+H} =9.\n\nAt each turn tau from 3 to 3+H-1, we are at y_tau before action, and we might have collision if on freeway and occupied at time tau.\n\nFor the position at time tau, y_tau.\n\nIn this case, for collision, it's at the time when we are on that y.\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=3+H.\n\nWith H=6: start y_3=3, after actions a3 to a8? t from 3 to 8.\n\nActions at t=3,4,5,6,7 for H=5 actions? I think I'm confusing.\n\nLet me define: let T be the turn number.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nThen I choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThe sequence of actions for T from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so H actions, and after that, at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nHere t_1=3.\n\nSo for min H, actions at T=3,4,5,...,3+H-1, and y_{3+H} =9.\n\nAt each turn T, for T from 3 to 3+H-1, we are at position (0, y_T), and we need no collision, meaning if y_T in 1-8, it must not be occupied at time T.\n\nAlso, at turn 3+H, when we reach y=9, we are not on freeway, so no issue.\n\nNow for H=6: actions at T=3,4,5,6,7,8? T=3 to 3+H-1=3+5=8? H actions, from T=3 to T=3+H-1.\n\nFor H=6, actions at T=3,4,5,6,7,8? T=3 to T=8, that's 6 actions: T=3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nThen after last action at T=8, y_{9} = y_8 + delta, and we want y_9=9.\n\ny_9 is at turn 9.\n\nStart at T=3, y_3=3.\n\nAfter action at T=3, y_4\n\nAfter action at T=4, y_5\n\n...\nAfter action at T=8, y_9\n\nAnd we want y_9=9.\n\nAt each turn T from 3 to 8, we have position y_T, and we need no collision at T for y_T.\n\nFor H=6, we need to go from y_3=3 to y_9=9 in 6 steps, so net +6, so all actions must be U, y_T = 3 + (T-3) for T from 3 to 8? y_3=3, a3=U, y4=4; a4=U, y5=5; a5=U, y6=6; but at T=6, y6=6, occupied, collision.\n\nIf I do something else, but with H=6, net +6, must all U, no choice, so impossible for H=6.\n\nThus min H at least 7.\n\nNow H=7: actions at T=3 to T=9? H actions from T=3 to T=3+H-1.\n\nFor H=7, actions at T=3,4,5,6,7,8,9? T=3 to T=9, that's 7 actions.\n\nThen after action at T=9, y_{10} =9.\n\ny_{10} at turn 10.\n\nStart y_3=3, end y_10=9.\n\nNet increase 6 in 7 steps, so we must have 6 U and 1 S or 5 U, 1 D, 1 something, but net +6.\n\nu - d =6, u + d + s =7.\n\nThen 2u + s =13, 2d + s =1.\n\nAs before, d=0, s=1, u=6.\n\nSo one stay, no down.\n\nSo actions: six U and one S.\n\nNow, we need to place the stay so that we avoid the bad positions.\n\nNow, the bad times: at T=6, which is τ=3 (T-3), we need y_6 not in {2,3,4,5,6}\n\nSimilarly, at T=8, which is τ=5, we need if y_8=7 or 8, occupied, so must not be 7 or 8 at T=8.\n\nSimilarly at T=9, τ=6, must not be 7 or 8.\n\nBut at T=9, we are performing action, position y_9, and we want y_10=9.\n\ny_9 could be 8 or 9 or less.\n\nSince we end at y_10=9, and actions include T=9.\n\nList the turns where we have positions: for collision, we care about y_T for T from 3 to 9 (since actions at T=3 to 9, positions at T=3 to 9).\n\nAt T=10, we reach y_10=9, no collision check.\n\nSo positions to check: T=3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nNow constraints:\n\n- At T=6: y_6 not in {2,3,4,5,6}, so y_6 = 0 or 1 or 7 or 8 or 9\n\nBut since we start from y=3 and go up, y_6=9 possible? y_3=3, in 3 steps to T=6, y_6 <= 3+3=6, so y_6 <=6, cannot be 7,8,9. Similarly min y_6=0.\n\nSo y_6 must be 0 or 1.\n\n- At T=8: if y_8=7 or 8, occupied, so must not be 7 or 8. Similarly for T=9.\n\nT=8: y_8 cannot be 7 or 8.\n\nT=9: y_9 cannot be 7 or 8.\n\nNow, since we have to reach y_10=9, and we have actions.\n\nAlso, y must be integer 0-9.\n\nNow, we have six U and one S in actions at T=3 to 9.\n\nThe S can be at any of T=3 to 9.\n\ny starts at 3.\n\nWe need to choose when to stay so that y_6=0 or 1.\n\ny_6 must be 0 or 1.\n\nSince y_3=3, and we move step by step.\n\nLet me denote the y values.\n\ny_3 = 3\n\ny_4 = y_3 + delta a3\n\n...\n\ny_10 = y_9 + delta a9\n\nWith each delta in {-1,0,1}, but since u=6,d=0,s=1, all delta >=0, and sum of delta from y3 to y10 is 6.\n\ny10 - y3 =6, so sum of seven deltas is 6, since one S, delta=0, and six U, delta=1.\n\nNow, y_6 must be 0 or 1.\n\nBut y_3=3, and y_6 = y_3 + sum_{k=3}^{5} delta a_k\n\nFrom T=3 to T=6, there are three actions: at T=3,4,5, which affect y4,y5,y6.\n\ny_6 = y_3 + delta a3 + delta a4 + delta a5\n\nSince delta a_t is the action at t, which affects y_{t+1}, but y_{t+1} = y_t + delta a_t.\n\ny_t is position at turn t before action.\n\nAfter action at t, y_{t+1} = y_t + delta a_t.\n\nSo y_6 = y_5 + delta a5\n\nBut y_5 = y_4 + delta a4\n\ny_4 = y_3 + delta a3\n\nSo y_6 = y_3 + delta a3 + delta a4 + delta a5\n\nSimilarly, y_3=3, so y_6 = 3 + delta a3 + delta a4 + delta a5\n\nEach delta a_t in {0,1} since no down, only S or U.\n\nSo y_6 = 3 + d3 + d4 + d5, where d_t = delta a_t in {0,1}\n\ny_6 must be 0 or 1.\n\nBut 3 + d3 + d4 + d5 <= 3 +1+1+1=6, min 3+0+0+0=3.\n\nSo y_6 >=3 and <=6.\n\nBut it must be 0 or 1, which is impossible, since min 3.\n\ny_6 = 3 + d3 + d4 + d5 >=3, and must be <=1, contradiction.\n\nTherefore, with H=7, it is impossible to have y_6 <=1, since y_6 >=3.\n\nBut we need y_6 <=1 for safety at T=6.\n\nBut y_6 cannot be less than 3, since y_3=3 and no down actions.\n\nTherefore, for H=7, it is impossible to avoid the collision at T=6 because y_6 must be between 3 and 6, all occupied.\n\nThus H=7 is also impossible.\n\nWe need H larger.\n\nNow try H=8.\n\nH=8 actions: from T=3 to T=10, actions at T=3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10? T=3 to T=3+H-1=3+7=10? H actions from T=3 to T=3+H-1.\n\nFor H=8, actions at T=3 to T=10 (since 3 to 10 inclusive is 8 actions: 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)\n\nThen after action at T=10, y_{11} =9.\n\nStart y_3=3, end y_{11}=9, net +6 in 8 steps.\n\nSo u - d =6, u + d + s =8.\n\nThen 2u + s =14, 2d + s =2.\n\nNow, 2d + s =2, so possible: d=0, s=2; or d=1, s=0.\n\nIf d=0, s=2, u=6.\n\nIf d=1, s=1, u=7? u - d =6, u + d + s =8.\n\nIf d=1, u=7, then u + d + s =7+1+s=8, so s=0.\n\nSimilarly, if d=0, u=6, s=2.\n\nIf d=1, u=7, s=0.\n\nNow, we also have constraints at T=8 and T=9.\n\nFirst, at T=6, we need y_6 not in {2,3,4,5,6}, so y_6=0 or1 or7 or8 or9.\n\nNow with down actions possible, y_6 can be low.\n\nSimilarly, at T=8, y_8 cannot be 7 or 8.\n\nAt T=9, y_9 cannot be 7 or 8.\n\nSince we end at y_{11}=9, y_10 and y_11.\n\nNow, let's see possible.\n\nFirst, to have y_6 <=1 or >=7.\n\nBut from y_3=3, to y_6 in 3 steps, y_6 can be from 0 to 6.\n\ny_6 = y_3 + sum_{k=3}^5 delta a_k = 3 + d3 + d4 + d5, but now delta can be -1,0,1.\n\nSo y_6 = 3 + da3 + da4 + da5, each da in {-1,0,1}, so y_6 from 0 to 6.\n\nSimilarly, it can be 0 or 1.\n\nNow, also, for T=8 and T=9 constraints.\n\nT=8 is when? T=8, τ= T-3=5.\n\nIn absolute time.\n\nNow, let's consider the cases.\n\nFirst, suppose we have d=0, s=2, u=6. Or d=1, u=7, s=0.\n\nWe need to place the actions.\n\nMoreover, we have to avoid y=7 and 8 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nT=8 and T=9 are within the action turns.\n\nNow, since we have down actions possible, we can go to lower y at T=6.\n\nFor example, set y_6=1.\n\nThen from there, go up to y=9.\n\nBut let's list the sequence.\n\nStart y_3=3.\n\nWe need to reach y_11=9.\n\nActions at T=3 to T=10.\n\nPositions at T=3 to T=10 to check for collision.\n\nAt T=10, position y_10, then after action y_11.\n\nBut collision at T only if y_T in 1-8.\n\nNow, y_11 not checked.\n\nSo positions T=3 to T=10.\n\nConstraints:\n\n- At T=6: y_6 not in {2,3,4,5,6}, so y_6=0,1,7,8,9\n\nBut y_6 min 0, max 6, so possible 0 or 1.\n\n- At T=8: y_8 not 7 or 8\n\n- At T=9: y_9 not 7 or 8\n\nAlso, at T=7: y_7 could be 7 or 8, but only occupied at T=8 and 9, not at T=7, so at T=7, y=7 or 8 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, other times.\n\nNow, to minimize H, H=8 is possible.\n\nLet's try to have y_6=1.\n\nSo at T=6, y_6=1.\n\nThen from y_3=3 to y_6=1 in 3 steps, so net change -2, so we need two down actions or one down and one stay, etc.\n\ny_6 = y_3 + da3 + da4 + da5 = 3 + da3 + da4 + da5 =1, so da3 + da4 + da5 = -2.\n\nEach da in {-1,0,1}, so possible, for example, two D and one S, or one D and two S but sum -2, so must have two D and one U? da3 + da4 + da5 = -2.\n\nSince each <=1, to sum -2, need two -1 and one 0, or three -1 but min sum -3, so possible: two D and one S.\n\nFor example, at T=3, D: y4 = y3 + (-1) =2\n\nT=4, D: y5 = y4 + (-1) =1\n\nT=5, S: y6 = y5 + 0 =1\n\nOr other orders.\n\ny_6=1, which is freeway 1, but at T=6, freeway 1 is not occupied, as we computed earlier, so safe.\n\nThen from y_6=1, we need to go to y_11=9, which is 8 steps away? From T=6 to T=11, 5 steps? Actions from T=6 to T=10 for the remaining.\n\nAfter T=6, we have actions at T=6,7,8,9,10 to reach y_11=9.\n\ny_6=1, y_11=9, net +8 in 5 steps, so must go up fast.\n\nBut with u,d,s.\n\nNumber of actions from T=6 to T=10: 5 actions.\n\ny_11 = y_6 + sum_{k=6}^{10} da_k =1 + sum da =9, so sum da from k=6 to10 =8.\n\nEach da <=1, so must have all U, no other choice.\n\nBut we have 5 actions, sum da=8, impossible since max sum 5.\n\ny_11 = y_10 + da10\n\nBut y_10 = y_9 + da9\n\n...\n\ny_7 = y_6 + da6\n\nSo y_11 = y_6 + da6 + da7 + da8 + da9 + da10\n\n=1 + da6 + da7 + da8 + da9 + da10 =9\n\nSo da6 + ... + da10 =8\n\nEach da in {-1,0,1}, so to sum 8, must all be 1, but there are 5 actions, max sum 5, 5<8, impossible.\n\nTherefore, cannot have y_6=1 if we want to reach y_11=9 with H=8.\n\nSimilarly, if y_6=0, even worse, sum da=9, impossible.\n\nSo y_6 cannot be 0 or 1 because we can't reach y_11=9 in 5 steps with only +1 max per step.\n\nNet increase from y_6 to y_11 is 8 or 9, in 5 steps, max increase 5, impossible.\n\nTherefore, for H=8, we cannot have y_6=0 or 1.\n\nBut we need y_6 not in 2-6, so must be 7,8,9, but y_6 max is 6, as from y_3=3 in 3 steps, max y_6=6, min 0, so cannot be 7,8,9.\n\nThus for H=8, at T=6, y_6 must be between 0 and 6, but to be safe, must be 0 or 1, but then we cannot reach y_11=9 in the remaining steps.\n\nIf we have y_6=6, but it is occupied, collision.\n\nSo H=8 also impossible.\n\nWe need larger H.\n\nTry H=9.\n\nH=9 actions: from T=3 to T=11, actions at T=3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11? T=3 to T=11, that's 9 actions.\n\nThen after action at T=11, y_{12}=9.\n\nStart y_3=3, end y_12=9, net +6 in 9 steps.\n\nu - d =6, u + d + s =9.\n\nThen 2u + s =15, 2d + s =3.\n\nPossible cases: d=0, s=3, u=6; or d=1, s=1, u=7; or d=2, s=-1 impossible, or d=1, s=1, u=7; or d=0, s=3, u=6; or d=2, s= -1 no; 2d + s =3.\n\nIf d=0, s=3, u=6\n\nIf d=1, s=1, u=7\n\nIf d=2, s=-1 impossible, so only (d,s,u) = (0,3,6) or (1,1,7)\n\nNow, at T=6, we need y_6 =0 or 1.\n\ny_6 = y_3 + da3 + da4 + da5 =3 + da3 + da4 + da5\n\nMust be 0 or 1, so da3 + da4 + da5 = -3 or -2.\n\nIf = -3, then y_6=0; if -2, y_6=1.\n\nEach da in {-1,0,1}, so sum -3 only if all three D.\n\nSum -2 with two D and one S, or one D and two S? Sum -2: two D and one S, or three D but sum -3, not -2.\n\nTwo D and one S: sum -2 +0 = -2\n\nOne D and two S: -1+0+0= -1\n\nOr three S: 0\n\nSo to have sum -2, must have two D and one S in actions at T=3,4,5.\n\nSimilarly, for sum -3, three D.\n\nThen from y_6, we need to go to y_12=9.\n\ny_12 = y_6 + sum_{k=6}^{11} da_k\n\nIf y_6=0, then 0 + sum da =9, so sum_{k=6}^{11} da_k =9, with 6 actions (T=6 to11), each da<=1, max sum 6, 6<9 impossible.\n\nIf y_6=1, then 1 + sum da =9, sum da=8 with 6 actions, max 6<8 impossible.\n\nThus, for H=9, if we set y_6=0 or 1, we cannot reach y_12=9 because the remaining increase is too large for the steps.\n\nBut we have to have y_6=0 or 1 for safety, but then impossible to reach goal.\n\nTherefore, H=9 also not possible if we go down.\n\nBut we can have y_6 not low, but at T=6, y_6 must be 0 or 1 for safety, but it can't be high, so only low, but then can't reach goal.\n\nPerhaps for H=9, we can be at y=7 or 8 at T=6, but impossible as max y_6=6.\n\nSo no, H=9 not possible.\n\nI need to go to y=7 or 8 at T=6, but I can't with the steps.\n\nPerhaps for larger H, but it will be worse.\n\nAnother idea: at T=6, I can be on y=7 or 8 if I start from lower, but I start from y=3.\n\nOr perhaps I can be at high y at T=6 by using down actions earlier, but down actions make y lower, not higher.\n\nTo have high y at T=6, I need to go up fast, but from y_3=3, max y_6=6 with three U.\n\nI can't be higher.\n\nSo y_6 <=6 always.\n\nTherefore, for any H, at T=6, y_6 <=6, and to be safe, must be 0 or 1, but if y_6=0 or 1, then to reach y=9 at later time, I need many steps, increasing H.\n\nFor example, if y_6=1, then to y=9, need at least 8 more steps, so from t=3 to t=6 is 3 steps, then to y=9 at least 8 steps, so min H=11 actions, reaching at t=3+11=14.\n\nSimilarly, if y_6=0, worse.\n\nBut at T=8 and T=9, we have constraints for y=7 and 8.\n\nFirst, let's assume we go to y_6=1.\n\nThen from there, we can go up.\n\nBut we also need to avoid y=7 and 8 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nT=8 and T=9 are absolute times.\n\nNow, let's list all occupied times again.\n\nWe have y=7 occupied at T=8 and T=9.\n\ny=8 occupied at T=8 and T=9.\n\nOther times safe.\n\nSo for the player, at T=8, if on y=7 or 8, collision.\n\nSimilarly at T=9.\n\nNow, if we set y_6=1 at T=6.\n\nThen actions from T=6 to T=6+H' for some H' to reach y=9.\n\nBut let's think of the sequence from start.\n\nSuppose we have y_6=1.\n\nThen at T=6, position y=1, safe.\n\nNow, from T=6, we need to go to y=9.\n\nMin steps from y=1 to y=9 is 8 steps, with all U.\n\nBut we have to avoid the bad times at T=8 and T=9.\n\nWith all U from T=6:\n\nT=6: y=1, action U, y7=2\n\nT=7: y=2, action U, y8=3\n\nT=8: y=3, action U, y9=4\n\nBut at T=8, y=3, freeway 3, is it occupied? At T=8, freeway 3: car with s=12, at T=8, Δt=5, span [-47+60, -36+60] = [13,24], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=9: y=4, freeway 4 at T=9, Δt=6, span [-47+72, -36+72] = [25,36], 0 not in, safe.\n\nT=10: y=5, etc., but we are going up.\n\nBut to reach y=9, from y=1 at T=6, with all U: after action at T=6, y7=2; T=7, y8=3; T=8, y9=4; T=9, y10=5; T=10, y11=6; T=11, y12=7; T=12, y13=8; T=13, y14=9.\n\nSo at T=14, y=9.\n\nBut at T=8, y=3, safe; T=9, y=4, safe; but at T=11, y=7? T=11, y=7, freeway 7 at T=11.\n\nFreeway 7: at T=11, Δt=8, first car span [ -41 +48, -30+48] = [7,18], 0 in? 0 between 7 and 18? 7<=0<=18 false, 0<7, so no.\n\nSecond car [7+48,18+48]=[55,66], 0 not in. So safe.\n\nSimilarly, all safe, but it takes many turns.\n\nH is the number of actions from T=3 to T=13, 11 actions, reach at T=14.\n\nBut we can be faster by not going down so much.\n\nSince at T=6 we need to be low, but we can be at y=1 with less down.\n\nIn the first part, to have y_6=1, we need to go down from y_3=3.\n\nFor example, with two down and one stay in the first three actions.\n\nBut with H=11, it might work.\n\nBut we can optimize to reduce H.\n\nSince the only bad time for y=2-6 is at T=6, and for y=7-8 at T=8 and T=9, we can be on y=7 or 8 at other times.\n\nFor example, to reach y=9 faster, we can be at high y at T=6, but we can't, max 6.\n\nSo we have to be low at T=6.\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut to avoid the T=8 and T=9 for y=7-8, we can be on y=7 or 8 before or after.\n\nFor example, if we can be on y=7 at T=7 or T=10, etc.\n\nIn the above path, with y_6=1, then all U, at T=11 y=7, T=12 y=8, T=13 y=9, all safe.\n\nBut at T=12 y=8, is it occupied? T=12, freeway 8 at T=12, Δt=9, first car span [ -41 +54, -30+54] = [13,24], 0 not in; second car [7+54,18+54]=[61,72], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut H=11 actions.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier by not going all the way to y=1.\n\nBut y_6 must be 0 or 1, so minimum y_6=0 or 1.\n\nWith y_6=1, we start from y=3.\n\nTo have y_6=1, we need net change -2 in three steps.\n\nFor example:\n\nOption: at T=3, D: y4 = 3-1=2\n\nT=4, D: y5 =2-1=1\n\nT=5, S: y6 =1+0=1\n\nThen from T=6, y6=1\n\nThen actions: T=6 U: y7=2\n\nT=7 U: y8=3\n\nT=8 U: y9=4\n\nT=9 U: y10=5\n\nT=10 U: y11=6\n\nT=11 U: y12=7\n\nT=12 U: y13=8\n\nT=13 U: y14=9\n\nBut we have actions up to T=13 for y14=9, so H=11 actions from T=3 to T=13.\n\nAt T=8, y8=3, safe; T=9, y9=4, safe; no problem with y=7 or 8 at T=8 or 9.\n\nBut at T=11, y11=6, is it occupied? T=11, freeway 6 at T=11, Δt=8, first car span [-47+96, -36+96] = [49,60], 0 not in; second car [25+96,36+96]=[121,132], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly all good.\n\nBut H=11, but earlier with min we had issues, but here it works.\n\nBut can we do with less?\n\nSuppose for the first part, we do three down to have y_6=0.\n\nBut then we need more steps to come up.\n\nFor example, T=3 D: y4=2\n\nT=4 D: y5=1\n\nT=5 D: y6=0\n\nThen from y6=0, to y=9, need 9 steps with all U: T=6 U y7=1, T=7 U y8=2, T=8 U y9=3, ..., up to T=14 U y15=9, H=12 actions, worse.\n\nSo better to have y_6=1.\n\nWith y_6=1, H=11 actions.\n\nBut we also have the constraints at T=8 and T=9 for y=7 and 8, but in this path, at T=8 and T=9, we are at y=3 and 4, not 7 or 8, so no issue.\n\nBut can we reach faster by having the stay later or something.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps we can be at y=7 or 8 at T=6, but impossible.\n\nOr, for the second part, we can go faster by not being constrained at T=8 and T=9.\n\nBut in this case, with H=11, it works.\n\nBut let's check if we can do with H=10.\n\nH=10 actions: from T=3 to T=12, actions at T=3 to T=12, 10 actions, then y13=9.\n\nStart y3=3, end y13=9, net +6 in 10 steps.\n\nu - d =6, u + d + s =10.\n\n2u + s =16, 2d + s =4.\n\nPossible: d=0, s=4, u=6; d=1, s=2, u=7; d=2, s=0, u=8.\n\nNow, at T=6, y6 must be 0 or 1.\n\ny6 = 3 + da3 + da4 + da5 must be 0 or 1.\n\nSo da3 + da4 + da5 = -3, -2, or -1? y6 =3 + sum da =0 or 1, so sum da = -3 or -2.\n\nAs before, sum da = -3 with three D, or -2 with two D and one S.\n\nThen from y6, to y13=9.\n\nIf y6=1, then 1 + sum_{k=6}^{12} da_k =9, so sum da from k=6 to12 =8, with 7 actions (T=6 to12), max sum 7, 7<8 impossible.\n\nIf y6=0, then 0 + sum da =9, sum da=9 with 7 actions, max 7<9 impossible.\n\nThus for H=10, impossible.\n\nSimilarly for H=11: actions from T=3 to T=13, 11 actions, y14=9.\n\nu - d =6, u + d + s =11.\n\n2u + s =17, 2d + s =5.\n\nNow, y6 must be 0 or 1.\n\ny6 =3 + da3 + da4 + da5 =0 or 1, so sum da3-5 = -3 or -2.\n\nSay with two D and one S, sum da = -2, y6=1.\n\nOr three D, y6=0.\n\nThen from y6 to y14=9.\n\ny14 = y6 + sum_{k=6}^{13} da_k\n\nIf y6=1, then 1 + sum_{k=6}^{13} da_k =9, sum da =8 with 8 actions (T=6 to13), possible with all U.\n\nSimilarly, if y6=0, sum da=9 with 8 actions, impossible, max 8, but 8=8 only if all U, but sum da=9>8 impossible, so only y6=1 possible.\n\nThen with all U from T=6 to T=13.\n\nBut we have to avoid y=7 and 8 at T=8 and T=9.\n\nIn the sequence with all U from y6=1:\n\ny6=1 at T=6\n\nThen:\n\nT=6 action U: y7=2\n\nT=7 action U: y8=3\n\nT=8 action U: y9=4\n\nT=9 action U: y10=5\n\nT=10 action U: y11=6\n\nT=11 action U: y12=7\n\nT=12 action U: y13=8\n\nT=13 action U: y14=9\n\nNow, positions to check for collision:\n\nT=6: y=1, freeway 1 at T=6, Δt=3, span [-50+9, -39+9]=[-41,-30], 0 not in, safe.\n\nT=7: y=2, freeway 2 at T=7, Δt=4, span [-47+48, -36+48]=[1,12], 0 in? 1 <=0<=12? 0<1, false, so 0 not in, safe.\n\nT=8: y=3, freeway 3 at T=8, Δt=5, span [-47+60, -36+60]=[13,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nT=9: y=4, freeway 4 at T=9, Δt=6, span [-47+72, -36+72]=[25,36], 0 not in, safe.\n\nT=10: y=5, freeway 5 at T=10, Δt=7, span [-47+84, -36+84]=[37,48], 0 not in, safe.\n\nT=11: y=6, freeway 6 at T=11, Δt=8, first car span [-47+96, -36+96]=[49,60], 0 not in; second car [25+96,36+96]=[121,132], 0 not in, safe.\n\nT=12: y=7, freeway 7 at T=12, Δt=9, first car span [-41+54, -30+54]=[13,24], 0 not in; second car [7+54,18+54]=[61,72], 0 not in, safe.\n\nT=13: y=8, freeway 8 at T=13, similarly, safe as above.\n\nAnd T=14, y=9, safe.\n\nNow, for the first part, to have y6=1.\n\nAt T=3, y3=3\n\nWe need y6=1.\n\nWith actions at T=3,4,5.\n\ny4 = y3 + da3\n\ny5 = y4 + da4\n\ny6 = y5 + da5\n\nAnd y6=1.\n\nSince da in {-1,0,1}, and y6=1.\n\nFor example:\n\nT=3: D, so da3 = -1, y4 = 3-1=2\n\nT=4: D, da4 = -1, y5 = 2-1=1\n\nT=5: S, da5 = 0, y6 =1+0=1\n\nOr T=3: S, y4=3; T=4: D, y5=2; T=5: D, y6=1, etc.\n\nIn this case, with T=5 action S, but we can have other.\n\nBut in the sequence, for the actions.\n\nNow, for the full sequence with H=11.\n\nActions:\n\nT=3: D (since we go down)\n\nT=4: D\n\nT=5: S (for example)\n\nThen T=6: U\n\nT=7: U\n\nT=8: U\n\nT=9: U\n\nT=10: U\n\nT=11: U\n\nT=12: U\n\nT=13: U\n\nThen y14=9.\n\nIn the action sequence, we have actions from T=3 to T=13 for H=11.\n\nIn the sequence above, at T=5, we have action S, position y5=1.\n\nCheck collision at each T.\n\nT=3: y=3, freeway 3 at T=3, Δt=0, span [-47,-36], 0 not in, safe.\n\nT=4: y=2, freeway 2 at T=4, Δt=1, span [-47+12, -36+12]=[-35,-24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nT=5: y=1, freeway 1 at T=5, Δt=2, span [-50+6, -39+6]=[-44,-33], 0 not in, safe. (s=3, Δt=2, -50+6= -44? 3*2=6, yes)\n\nT=6: y=1, as above, safe.\n\nThen the rest as before.\n\nAll safe.\n\nBut is there a way with fewer actions?\n\nSuppose we have y_6=1, but with different first actions.\n\nFor example, if at T=3 we do S, then y4=3\n\nT=4 D, y5=2\n\nT=5 D, y6=1\n\nThen same as above.\n\nOr T=3 D, y4=2\n\nT=4 S, y5=2\n\nT=5 D, y6=1\n\nThen y5=2 at T=5, freeway 2 at T=5, Δt=2, span [-47+24, -36+24]=[-23,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut still H=11.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 earlier by not doing all U in the second part, but we have to.\n\nSince we have extra s or d, but in this case with u=9? In H=11, with net +6, and y6=1 from y3=3, so from y3 to y6, change -2, then from y6 to y14, change +8, with 8 actions, so all U, no choice.\n\nSo minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let's confirm the answer format.\n\nThe current turn is t_1=3, so actions from t=3 onwards.\n\nWith H=11, actions at t=3 to t=13.\n\nSequence:\n\nt=3: D\n\nt=4: D\n\nt=5: S (for example)\n\nt=6: U\n\nt=7: U\n\nt=8: U\n\nt=9: U\n\nt=10: U\n\nt=11: U\n\nt=12: U\n\nt=13: U\n\nThen at t=14, y=9.\n\nBut in the sequence, at t=5, we have S, but we can avoid stay if we use down differently, but we need the net.\n\nSince in the first part, to have y6=1, we need two down and one something, but with S or U, but U would make y higher, not lower, so we must have two down and one S or two down and one U but with U, y higher, not to 1.\n\nFor example, if we have one down and two S, y6=2 or 3, not 1.\n\nBut y6 must be 1 or 0, so we need at least two down in the first three actions.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence above, it's fine.\n\nBut in the second part, all U.\n\nNow, about the constraints at T=8 and T=9.\n\nIn this path, at T=8, y=3, not 7 or 8; T=9, y=4, not 7 or 8, so safe.\n\nWe could be at y=7 or 8 at other times.\n\nBut in this case, no issue.\n\nPerhaps we can start going up first, but at T=6 we need to be low.\n\nFor example, if at T=3 U, y4=4; T=4 U, y5=5; but at T=5, if we do D, y6=4, but y6=4 at T=6 is occupied, collision.\n\nIf at T=5 S, y6=5, occupied.\n\nSo we must go down early to be low at T=6.\n\nSo the sequence is necessary.\n\nThus minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let's see if we can do with H=10 by reaching later or something, but we saw impossible.\n\nPerhaps with H=11, but we can have the goal at t=13 if we go faster, but from y6=1, min to y9 is 8 steps, to t=14.\n\nUnless we are at higher y at T=6, but we can't.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nNow for the actions, we need to specify.\n\nIn the first part, we can choose which action to have the stay or down.\n\nFor example, let's set:\n\nTurn t=3: action D, so y4=2\n\nTurn t=4: action D, y5=1\n\nTurn t=5: action S, y6=1\n\nThen\n\nTurn t=6: U, y7=2\n\nt=7: U, y8=3\n\nt=8: U, y9=4\n\nt=9: U, y10=5\n\nt=10: U, y11=6\n\nt=11: U, y12=7\n\nt=12: U, y13=8\n\nt=13: U, y14=9\n\nActions from t=3 to t=13, 11 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=5, action S, but we can have at t=3 S, t=4 D, t=5 D, etc., but similar.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut in the car state, there is freeway 6 with two cars, but we handled.\n\nAlso, at t=8 and t=9, y=7 and 8 occupied, but in this path, we are not on them at those times.\n\nSo should be fine.\n\nPerhaps we can have a shorter path by being on y=7 at t=7 or t=10, but since we have to be low at t=6, it takes time.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nThus H=11.\n\nSequence of actions:\n\nTurn t=3: D\n\nTurn t=4: D\n\nTurn t=5: S\n\nTurn t=6: U\n\nTurn t=7: U\n\nTurn t=8: U\n\nTurn t=9: U\n\nTurn t=10: U\n\nTurn t=11: U\n\nTurn t=12: U\n\nTurn t=13: U\n\nAfter that, at turn t=14, position (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence, the last action is at t=13, to reach at t=14.\n\nIn the answer, it should be the actions from t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nt_1=3, H=11, so t=3 to 13.\n\nNow to box the answer.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can avoid the stay.\n\nFor example, if we do three down: t=3 D, y4=2; t=4 D, y5=1; t=5 D, y6=0; then from y6=0, we need more steps, worse.\n\nOr, at t=3 D, y4=2; t=4 S, y5=2; t=5 D, y6=1, same as before.\n\nSo with S at t=5.\n\nPerhaps we can have the S later, but in the first part, we need to have y6=1, which requires the actions as above.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 3\\) is 11. This sequence avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on any freeway \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 6\\) at turn \\(t = 6\\) (when all these freeways are occupied) and not on freeways \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) at turns \\(t = 8\\) and \\(t = 9\\) (when they are occupied).\n\nThe sequence of actions is designed as follows:\n- At turns \\(t = 3\\) and \\(t = 4\\), move down (D) to decrease the y-position, avoiding being on freeways \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 6\\) at \\(t = 6\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 5\\), stay (S) to maintain y-position at 1, which is safe at \\(t = 6\\).\n- From turn \\(t = 6\\) to \\(t = 13\\), move up (U) each turn to reach y-position 9 at turn \\(t = 14\\).\n\nThe actions and resulting positions are:\n\n| Turn | Action | Y-position after action | Collision check (position at turn) | Status |\n|------|--------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------|\n| \\(t = 3\\) | D | 2 | \\(t = 3\\): y=3, freeway 3 at \\(t=3\\): span \\([-47, -36]\\), 0 not in span | Safe |\n| \\(t = 4\\) | D | 1 | \\(t = 4\\): y=2, freeway 2 at \\(t=4\\): span \\([-35, -24]\\), 0 not in span | Safe |\n| \\(t = 5\\) | S | 1 | \\(t = 5\\): y=1, freeway 1 at \\(t=5\\): span \\([-44, -33]\\), 0 not in span | Safe |\n| \\(t = 6\\) | U | 2 | \\(t = 6\\): y=1, freeway 1 at \\(t=6\\): span \\([-41, -30]\\), 0 not in span | Safe |\n| \\(t = 7\\) | U | 3 | \\(t = 7\\): y=2, freeway 2 at \\(t=7\\): span \\([1, 12]\\), 0 not in span | Safe |\n| \\(t = 8\\) | U | 4 | \\(t = 8\\): y=3, freeway 3 at \\(t=8\\): span \\([13, 24]\\), 0 not in span | Safe |\n| \\(t = 9\\) | U | 5 | \\(t = 9\\): y=4, freeway 4 at \\(t=9\\): span \\([25, 36]\\), 0 not in span | Safe |\n| \\(t = 10\\) | U | 6 | \\(t = 10\\): y=5, freeway 5 at \\(t=10\\): span \\([37, 48]\\), 0 not in span | Safe |\n| \\(t = 11\\) | U | 7 | \\(t = 11\\): y=6, freeway 6 at \\(t=11\\): car1 span \\([49, 60]\\), car2 span \\([121, 132]\\), 0 not in span | Safe |\n| \\(t = 12\\) | U | 8 | \\(t = 12\\): y=7, freeway 7 at \\(t=12\\): car1 span \\([13, 24]\\), car2 span \\([61, 72]\\), 0 not in span | Safe |\n| \\(t = 13\\) | U | 9 | \\(t = 13\\): y=8, freeway 8 at \\(t=13\\): car1 span \\([13, 24]\\), car2 span \\([61, 72]\\), 0 not in span | Safe |\n\nAfter the action at turn \\(t = 13\\), the position at turn \\(t = 14\\) is \\((0, 9)\\), which is the goal and safe (no freeway at y=9).\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in 11 turns, and no shorter sequence is possible due to the constraints at turn \\(t = 6\\) (y=2 to y=6 occupied) and turns \\(t = 8\\) and \\(t = 9\\) (y=7 and y=8 occupied).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 3: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8. The current turn is t1=6, and I start at y=0. I can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing my y-position by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, staying within 0 to 9.\n\nCars move on their freeways, and I collide only if I'm on a freeway y at turn T and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at that exact turn. Also, when I move, I'm not on the new row until the next turn, so I only check collisions for the row I'm currently on.\n\nThe car spans are given at turn t1=6. For future turns, I need to compute where the cars are based on their speed and direction.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car: (-48, -59, right, 3) — head at -48, tail at -59? That seems backward. For right-moving, it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" and moves to [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]. But here it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). Let me check the notation.\n\nIn the car state table, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\". But in the update, for left-moving, span is [h, τ], and for right-moving, it's [τ, h]. I think there might be inconsistency.\n\nLook: for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and moves to [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" and moves to [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nBut in the input, for freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3). If direction is right, and it says (head h, tail τ), but for right-moving, head should be the front, which is larger x, but here h=-48, τ=-59, so τ < h since -59 < -48? -59 is less than -48, so τ = -59, h = -48, so if direction is right, the car is moving right, so at t1, span is from τ to h, which is from -59 to -48? But -59 to -48, moving right, so as time increases, both increase.\n\nIn the span definition, for right-moving, [τ, h] with τ < h, I assume? But here τ=-59, h=-48, so τ < h, so span is [τ, h] = [-59, -48] at t1.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn freeway 6, there are two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12). But for the first one, h=48, τ=37, so if right-moving, span should be [τ,h] = [37,48], but 37 to 48, that's fine. Second car: h=0, τ=-11, so [τ,h] = [-11,0] at t1.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAlso, freeway 7 and 8 have cars with negative positions, but since they move, they might come to x=0 at some point.\n\nI need to find when a car on a freeway has 0 in its span, meaning the car covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, I am on freeway y_T, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the span at T.\n\nSince I start at y=0, and I need to reach y=9, and freeways are from 1 to 8, I think y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars, so I only worry about y=1 to 8 when I'm on them.\n\nThe game: I start at (0,0) at turn t1=6. I need to get to (0,9), so y=9.\n\nEach turn, I choose action, which changes y for next turn.\n\nLet t be the turn number relative to t1. So at time t=0 (which is turn t1=6), I am at y=0.\n\nAfter action a_0, at time t=1, I am at y1, and so on.\n\nI need to find actions for turns from t=0 to t=H-1, such that at time H, I am at y_H=9, and for each turn from t=0 to t=H-1, when I am at y_t, there is no collision on that freeway if y_t between 1 and 8.\n\nAt each turn, when I am at position y_t, I check if y_t is between 1 and 8, and if so, for the cars on that row, if any car has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nThe turn is absolute, I think.\n\nLet T be the absolute turn.\n\nStart at T = t1 = 6, position y=0.\n\nAfter action at T=6, at T=7, I am at new y, and so on.\n\nCollision at turn T if I am on freeway k (1-8) and for some car on k, 0 in span at T.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when 0 is covered by any car.\n\nSince cars move at constant speed, I can find the times when a car covers x=0.\n\nFor a car, given at T=6, span and direction.\n\nLet ΔT = T - 6, for T >=6.\n\nFor a car on freeway k:\n\n- If left-moving: span at T=6 is [h, τ] with h > τ? In the update, for left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s ΔT, τ - s ΔT]\n\nAnd 0 in span means h - s ΔT <= 0 <= τ - s ΔT? Since left-moving, h is head, larger x, τ is tail, smaller x, so span [h, τ] with h > τ, I think? No.\n\nIn the text: for left-moving, \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and it moves left, so h decreases, τ decreases.\n\nBut in the span [h, τ], if it's left-moving, h should be the right end, τ left end, so if h > τ, then [h, τ] would be decreasing, but usually we write [left, right] or something.\n\nI think there's ambiguity.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" → moves to [h - s ΔT, τ - s ΔT]\n\nFor 0 to be in [h - s ΔT, τ - s ΔT], since it's an interval, we need min <= 0 <= max.\n\nBut is [h, τ] with h and τ, which is min, which max?\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3). Direction right, and (head, tail), but head and tail, which is front?\n\nPerhaps head is the front, tail is the back.\n\nFor right-moving, front is larger x, so if direction right, head h > tail τ.\n\nIn freeway 1: h=-48, τ=-59, since -48 > -59, so h > τ, so for right-moving, span is from τ to h, with τ < h.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, if there was, head would be larger, but moving left, so span from h to τ with h decreasing to smaller x.\n\nIn general, for a car, at time T, the span is [x_min, x_max] for the car.\n\nBut in the input, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed), and I think head is the front in the direction of motion.\n\nSo for direction right, head is right end, tail is left end, so x_head > x_tail, span is [x_tail, x_head].\n\nFor direction left, head is left end? No.\n\nLet's see the update rule.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" → [h - s ΔT, τ - s ΔT]\n\nAnd since it's moving left, h should be the right end at t1, τ the left end, so h > τ, and span [h, τ] with h decreasing, τ decreasing.\n\nBut [h, τ] with h > τ, so the interval is from τ to h, but written as [h, τ], which might be confusing, but in set notation, it's the values between min and max.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" for right-moving, and it moves to [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT], so for right-moving, τ is left end, h is right end, so τ < h.\n\nIn the input, for freeway 1: (h, τ, d, s) = (-48, -59, right, 3), so d=right, so at t1, left end τ=-59, right end h=-48, span [τ, h] = [-59, -48].\n\nSimilarly, for a car with d=left, it would be [h, τ] with h right, τ left.\n\nBut in freeways given, all are right-moving except... let's see, all cars have d=right, no left-moving in this state.\n\nFreeway 1: right\n\n2: right\n\n3: right\n\n4: right\n\n5: right\n\n6: both right\n\n7: both right\n\n8: both right\n\nAll cars are right-moving, so for all, at t1, span is [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nAnd at time T, span is [τ + s (T-6), h + s (T-6)]\n\n0 in span at T if τ + s (T-6) <= 0 <= h + s (T-6)\n\nSince τ + s (T-6) is left end, h + s (T-6) is right end.\n\nSo for each car, I can find when 0 is covered.\n\n0 in [left, right] if left <= 0 <= right.\n\nSo for a car, at T, left_T = τ + s (T-6)\n\nright_T = h + s (T-6)\n\n0 in span iff left_T <= 0 <= right_T\n\nWhich is τ + s (T-6) <= 0 <= h + s (T-6)\n\nSince s > 0, we can solve for T.\n\nFirst inequality: τ + s (T-6) <= 0 ⇒ s (T-6) <= -τ ⇒ T-6 <= -τ/s\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= h + s (T-6) ⇒ -h <= s (T-6) ⇒ T-6 >= -h/s\n\nSo T-6 >= ceil( -h/s ) ? Since T integer, we need to be careful with inequalities.\n\nLet ΔT = T - 6\n\nThen left = τ + s ΔT\n\nright = h + s ΔT\n\n0 in [left, right] iff left <= 0 and 0 <= right, so τ + s ΔT <= 0 and h + s ΔT >= 0\n\nSince s > 0, ΔT >=0.\n\nτ + s ΔT <= 0 ⇒ s ΔT <= -τ ⇒ ΔT <= -τ/s\n\nh + s ΔT >= 0 ⇒ s ΔT >= -h ⇒ ΔT >= -h/s\n\nSo -h/s <= ΔT <= -τ/s\n\nSince ΔT integer, ΔT must satisfy ceil(-h/s) <= ΔT <= floor(-τ/s)\n\nLet's see.\n\nFrom ΔT >= -h/s and ΔT <= -τ/s\n\nSince -h/s and -τ/s may not be integer, ΔT must be at least ceil(-h/s) and at most floor(-τ/s)\n\nFor example, ΔT >= -h/s, so min ΔT is ceil(-h/s)\n\nSimilarly, ΔT <= -τ/s, so max ΔT is floor(-τ/s)\n\nThen for each car, the set of ΔT where 0 in span is from ceil(-h/s) to floor(-τ/s) inclusive, provided ceil(-h/s) <= floor(-τ/s)\n\nIf not, no collision.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need the union over cars on that freeway of the times when 0 is covered.\n\nThen, for me to be safe on freeway k at turn T, I need that at that ΔT, no car on k covers 0.\n\nThat is, for that k and ΔT, it is not in the danger set.\n\nI start at T=6, y=0. y=0 has no cars, so safe.\n\nI need to go to y=9, also no cars, safe.\n\nBut I have to pass through y=1 to 8.\n\nEach move, I can change y by -1,0,+1, but since I start at 0 and need to go to 9, I probably want to go up, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid collisions.\n\nThe minimal H might involve moving directly up, but I need to check if it's possible without collision.\n\nH is the number of turns from t=0 to H-1, so after H actions, I am at y_H.\n\nAt turn T=6, I am at y=0, no action yet? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is for turns t1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so actions at times 6,7,8,..., up to turn 6+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, I am at position at time 6+H.\n\nAt time 6, I am at (0,0), before any action.\n\nAfter action a_6 at turn 6, I move to new y at time 7.\n\nGenerally: at turn T, I am at position y_T, then I choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, with Δy based on a_T.\n\nThen at turn T, I check collision based on y_T.\n\nFor turn T, position y_T, if 1<=y_T<=8, check cars on that row at turn T.\n\nThen I take action to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nI start at T=6, y_6=0, safe since no cars.\n\nI need to reach y_{6+H} =9 for some H.\n\nAfter H actions, at time 6+H, y=9.\n\nThe actions are from turn 6 to turn 6+H-1, H actions.\n\nNow, let's list all cars per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (h,τ,d,s) = (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nSince d=right, at t1=6, left=τ=-59, right=h=-48\n\ns=3\n\nΔT = T-6\n\nleft_T = τ + s ΔT = -59 + 3 ΔT\n\nright_T = h + s ΔT = -48 + 3 ΔT\n\n0 in span iff -59 + 3 ΔT <= 0 <= -48 + 3 ΔT\n\nWhich is 3 ΔT <= 59 and 3 ΔT >= 48? Let's see.\n\n-59 + 3 ΔT <= 0 ⇒ 3 ΔT <= 59 ⇒ ΔT <= 59/3 = 19.666, so ΔT <= 19\n\n0 <= -48 + 3 ΔT ⇒ 48 <= 3 ΔT ⇒ ΔT >= 48/3 = 16\n\nSo ΔT from 16 to 19 inclusive.\n\nSo for freeway 1, dangerous at ΔT=16,17,18,19 (T=22,23,24,25)\n\nΔT=16: T=22, left= -59+48= -11? -59+3*16= -59+48= -11, right= -48+48=0, so 0 in [-11,0], yes.\n\nΔT=17: left=-59+51= -8, right=-48+51=3, 0 in [-8,3], yes.\n\nΔT=18: left=-59+54= -5, right=-48+54=6, 0 in yes.\n\nΔT=19: left=-59+57= -2, right=-48+57=9, 0 in yes.\n\nΔT=20: left=-59+60=1, right=-48+60=12, 0 not <=1? 0 <=1 is true, but left=1, right=12, 1<=0<=12? 0<1, so 0 not >= left, so not in [1,12], so no.\n\nSimilarly ΔT=15: left=-59+45= -14, right=-48+45= -3, 0 not <= -3? 0 > -3, so not in [-14,-3], no.\n\nSo freeway 1 dangerous at T=22,23,24,25 (ΔT=16,17,18,19)\n\nNow freeway 2: one car: (48,37,right,12)\n\nh=48, τ=37, s=12\n\nleft_T = τ + s ΔT =37 +12 ΔT\n\nright_T =48 +12 ΔT\n\n0 in span: 37+12ΔT <=0 and 0<=48+12ΔT\n\nBut 37+12ΔT <=0? Since ΔT>=0, 37+12ΔT >=37>0, so left_T >=37>0, so 0 cannot be <= left_T, so 0 never in span for this car. Similarly, right_T >=48>0, so 0 < left_T always, not covered.\n\nSo no danger on freeway 2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same car? (48,37,right,12) identical to freeway 2, so same, no danger.\n\nFreeway 4: same, (48,37,right,12), no danger.\n\nFreeway 5: same, no danger.\n\nNow freeway 6: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12) same as above, no danger.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12)\n\nh=0, τ=-11, s=12\n\nleft_T = τ + s ΔT = -11 +12 ΔT\n\nright_T = h + s ΔT = 0 +12 ΔT =12 ΔT\n\n0 in span: -11 +12 ΔT <=0 and 0 <= 12 ΔT\n\n0 <= 12 ΔT always true for ΔT>=0.\n\n-11 +12 ΔT <=0 ⇒ 12 ΔT <=11 ⇒ ΔT <= 11/12 <1, so ΔT <=0 since ΔT integer >=0.\n\nΔT=0: left_T = -11 +0 = -11, right_T=0, so 0 in [-11,0], yes, since left<=0 and 0<=right.\n\nAt ΔT=0, T=6, right_T=0, so 0 <=0 is true.\n\nNow, 0 in span: left <=0 <= right.\n\nAt ΔT=0, left=-11, right=0, so -11 <=0 <=0, true.\n\nΔT=1: left=-11+12=1, right=12, 1<=0<=12? 0<1, false.\n\nSo only at ΔT=0, T=6.\n\nNow, for freeway 6, at T=6, this car has 0 in span.\n\nThe first car on freeway 6 has no danger, but second car has danger at T=6.\n\nSo freeway 6 is dangerous at T=6 (ΔT=0)\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,6) similar to freeway 1 but different speed.\n\nh=-48, τ=-59, d=right, s=6\n\nleft_T = τ + s ΔT = -59 +6 ΔT\n\nright_T = -48 +6 ΔT\n\n0 in span: -59 +6 ΔT <=0 and 0<= -48 +6 ΔT\n\nFirst: -59 +6 ΔT <=0 ⇒ 6 ΔT <=59 ⇒ ΔT <= 59/6 ≈9.833, so ΔT <=9\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 +6 ΔT ⇒ 48 <=6 ΔT ⇒ ΔT >= 48/6=8\n\nSo ΔT from 8 to 9 inclusive.\n\nΔT=8: left=-59+48= -11, right=-48+48=0, 0 in [-11,0], yes.\n\nΔT=9: left=-59+54= -5, right=-48+54=6, 0 in, yes.\n\nΔT=10: left=-59+60=1, right=-48+60=12, 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSo dangerous at ΔT=8,9; T=14,15\n\nNow second car on freeway 7: (0,-11,right,6)\n\nh=0, τ=-11, s=6\n\nleft_T = -11 +6 ΔT\n\nright_T = 0 +6 ΔT =6 ΔT\n\n0 in span: -11 +6 ΔT <=0 and 0 <=6 ΔT\n\n0 <=6 ΔT always for ΔT>=0.\n\n-11 +6 ΔT <=0 ⇒ 6 ΔT <=11 ⇒ ΔT <=11/6≈1.833, so ΔT <=1\n\nΔT=0: left=-11, right=0, 0 in, yes\n\nΔT=1: left=-11+6= -5, right=6, 0 in, yes\n\nΔT=2: left=-11+12=1, right=12, 0 not in\n\nSo for this car, dangerous at ΔT=0 and 1, T=6 and 7.\n\nNow for freeway 7, both cars: first car dangerous at ΔT=8,9; second at ΔT=0,1.\n\nSo overall, dangerous when either, so at ΔT=0,1,8,9; T=6,7,14,15.\n\nNow freeway 8: similar to freeway 7, same cars? \"(-48,-59,right,6), (0,-11,right,6)\" same as freeway 7.\n\nSo identical, dangerous at T=6,7,14,15.\n\nNow summarize for each freeway, dangerous times (T):\n\nFreeway 1: T=22,23,24,25\n\nFreeway 2: never\n\nFreeway 3: never\n\nFreeway 4: never\n\nFreeway 5: never\n\nFreeway 6: T=6 (only at ΔT=0)\n\nFreeway 7: T=6,7,14,15\n\nFreeway 8: T=6,7,14,15\n\nAt T=6, freeway 6,7,8 are dangerous? But I am at y=0 at T=6, not on freeway, so no collision.\n\nI need to move up through the freeways.\n\nI start at T=6, y=0.\n\nI can take actions to go up.\n\nThe minimal H might be small if I can go straight up.\n\nBut let's see the dangers.\n\nFirst, freeway 6 is dangerous only at T=6, but since I'm not on it at T=6, and later it might be safe.\n\nAt T=6, freeway 6 has a car covering x=0, but if I am on freeway 6 at T>6, is it dangerous?\n\nFor freeway 6, only dangerous at T=6, as per above.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 and 8 dangerous at T=6,7,14,15.\n\nNow, for example, if I go to y=1 at some T, I need to ensure that at that T, freeway 1 is not dangerous.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSince I need to reach y=9, and I start from y=0, I probably want to go up as fast as possible, but may need to avoid being on certain rows at certain times.\n\nThe dangerous times are in the future, T=14,15,22,etc, but since I start at T=6, I might reach early.\n\nLet me denote the turn T, absolute.\n\nAt T=6: I am at y=0, safe. I take action a_6, which determines y_7.\n\nThen at T=7, I am at y_7, check collision if y_7 between 1-8.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions from a_6 to a_{6+H-1} such that after H actions, at time 6+H, y=9.\n\nAnd for each T from 6 to 6+H-1, when I am at y_T, if 1<=y_T<=8, no collision at T on that freeway.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T is for that turn.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn T, position y_T is fixed before action a_T.\n\nAfter a_T, y_{T+1} is set.\n\nBut collision check is at T for y_T.\n\nNow, to minimize H, the minimal possible H is 9, if I go up every turn: from y=0 to y=9 in 9 moves, each up, so after 9 actions, at T=15, y=9.\n\nT=6: y=0\n\na=U, T=7: y=1\n\na=U, T=8: y=2\n\n...\n\nup to a=U at T=14, T=15: y=9\n\nActions from T=6 to T=14, that's 9 actions: a_6 to a_14, and at T=15, y=9.\n\nH=9 turns of actions? H actions from t=0 to H-1, so for H=9, actions at T=6 to T=14, position at T=15 is y=9.\n\nNow, during the path, I need to check for each T from 6 to 14, y_T, and collision if y_T in 1-8.\n\nAt T=6: y=0, safe.\n\nT=7: y=1, on freeway 1. Is freeway 1 dangerous at T=7? From above, freeway 1 dangerous at T=22-25, not at 7. So safe.\n\nT=8: y=2, freeway 2, no danger, safe.\n\nT=9: y=3, freeway 3, no danger, safe.\n\nT=10: y=4, freeway 4, no danger, safe.\n\nT=11: y=5, freeway 5, no danger, safe.\n\nT=12: y=6, freeway 6. Is freeway 6 dangerous at T=12? Freeway 6 only dangerous at T=6, not at 12. So safe.\n\nT=13: y=7, freeway 7. Dangerous at T=6,7,14,15. T=13 not in, so safe.\n\nT=14: y=8, freeway 8. Dangerous at T=6,7,14,15. T=14 is dangerous! At T=14, freeway 8 has collision.\n\nBecause freeway 8 dangerous at T=14.\n\nSo at T=14, if I am on y=8, I collide.\n\nBut in the path above, at T=14, I am at y=8, and freeway 8 dangerous, so collision.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be on freeway 8 at T=14.\n\nSimilarly, at T=15, if I were on y=8, it would be dangerous, but in this path, at T=15 I am at y=9, safe.\n\nBut at T=14, I am on y=8, which is dangerous.\n\nSo collision.\n\nThus, direct up in 9 moves is not possible because of T=14 on y=8.\n\nI need to adjust.\n\nPerhaps I can go slower or faster or change the timing.\n\nMinimal H might be more than 9.\n\nSince I need to avoid being on y=8 at T=14 or T=15, or y=7 at T=14,15? y=7 dangerous at T=14,15? Freeway 7 dangerous at T=14,15? T=14,15 are ΔT=8,9, yes.\n\nBut y=7 at T=14 would be bad, but in the path I am on y=7 at T=13, which is safe, but y=8 at T=14 bad.\n\nI could delay or advance some moves.\n\nFor example, if I stay at some point.\n\nStart at T=6, y=0.\n\nIf I go up immediately, I hit y=8 at T=14 which is bad.\n\nT=14 is dangerous for y=8.\n\nSimilarly, T=15 dangerous for y=8 and y=7? y=7 dangerous at T=14,15.\n\nBut y=8 at T=14 or 15 bad.\n\nNow, the danger times for y=8 are T=14,15.\n\nSimilarly for y=7, T=14,15.\n\nBut I need to pass through all rows.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=8 at a different time.\n\nFor example, if I go up slower.\n\nOr, since y=6 is safe at all times except T=6, which is past.\n\ny=6 dangerous only at T=6, so after that safe.\n\ny=5 always safe.\n\ny=4,3,2,1 safe except y=1 at T=22-25, but that's late.\n\nThe problem is around y=7 and 8 at T=14,15.\n\nT=14 and 15 are when I would be on y=8 and y=9 if going up, but y=9 safe.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=7 or 8 at T=14 or 15.\n\nSince I start at T=6, I can reach y=7 earlier or later.\n\nFor example, if I go up faster, but I can only move one step per turn, so from y=0 to y=7 in 7 moves: at T=13 y=7, which is safe as above.\n\nThen to y=8 at T=14, which is bad.\n\nIf I could go directly, but I can't.\n\nPerhaps I can stay at y=7 for one turn.\n\nBut y=7 at T=14 or 15 is dangerous.\n\nT=14 and 15 both dangerous for y=7 and y=8.\n\nFreeway 7 dangerous at T=14,15, freeway 8 at T=14,15.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=7 or y=8 at T=14 or T=15.\n\nThat means around that time, I need to be elsewhere.\n\nBut I have to go through y=7 and 8 at some point.\n\nSo I need to pass y=7 before T=14 or after T=15.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nSince I start at T=6, y=0, and need to reach y=9.\n\nThe critical times are T=14 and 15.\n\nIf I can be on y=7 before T=14, for example at T=13, which is safe, then move to y=8 at T=14, but T=14 y=8 dangerous, so I cannot move to y=8 at T=14 because at T=14 I would be on y=8 during collision.\n\nAt T=14, if I am on y=8, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay on y=7 at T=14, collision.\n\nSo I must not be on y=7 or 8 at T=14 or 15.\n\nTherefore, I need to be on y=7 at some T <=13 or T>=16.\n\nSimilarly for y=8 at some T <=13 or T>=16.\n\nBut since I move step by step, I need to go from y=6 to y=7 to y=8.\n\ny=6 is safe at all T except T=6, which is past.\n\nSo I can be on y=6 at any T>6.\n\nThen from y=6 to y=7.\n\nI can move to y=7 at T, for T not 14 or 15.\n\nSimilarly, from y=7 to y=8 at T not 14 or 15.\n\nAlso, I can stay or move down, but that might increase H.\n\nTo minimize H, I should go as fast as possible except avoid the bad times.\n\nSince T=14 and 15 are bad for y=7 and 8, I should be on y=7 before or after.\n\nEarliest I can be on y=7: start at T=6 y=0, go up each turn: T=7 y=1, T=8 y=2, T=9 y=3, T=10 y=4, T=11 y=5, T=12 y=6, T=13 y=7. So at T=13, y=7, which is safe.\n\nThen I need to go to y=8.\n\nBut if I go up at T=13, to y=8 at T=14, but T=14 y=8 dangerous.\n\nIf I stay at y=7 at T=13, action S, then at T=14, I am still on y=7, but T=14 y=7 dangerous! Freeway 7 dangerous at T=14.\n\nSo if I stay at T=13, y=7, then at T=14, y=7, collision.\n\nIf I go down to y=6 at T=14, but at T=14, if I am on y=6, freeway 6 is safe, only dangerous at T=6.\n\nBut going down might not help.\n\nFrom T=13 y=7, I can go down to y=6 at T=14.\n\nThen at T=14, y=6, which is safe.\n\nThen later go up.\n\nBut I need to go to y=9 eventually.\n\nSince I cannot be on y=7 or 8 at T=14 or 15, I must pass y=7 before T=14 or after T=15.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nThe gap is T=14 and 15.\n\nSo possible to go up to y=7 by T=13, then I need to leave y=7 before T=14, but since I move at turn, at T=13 I am on y=7, then I take action to go to y_14.\n\nIf I go to y=6 or y=8 at T=14, both might be problematic.\n\nIf I go to y=6 at T=14, then y=6 safe.\n\nIf I go to y=8 at T=14, y=8 dangerous.\n\nSo only option is to go down to y=6 at T=14.\n\nThen at T=14, I am on y=6, safe.\n\nBut I was on y=7 at T=13, safe.\n\nThen at T=14, y=6.\n\nThen I need to go back up.\n\nBut T=15 is also bad for y=7 and 8.\n\nAt T=14, I am on y=6, I can go up to y=7 at T=15, but T=15 y=7 dangerous.\n\nOr stay at y=6, or go down.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nPerhaps after T=15, I can go up.\n\nT=15 is bad, T=16 should be safe for y=7 and 8? Let's check.\n\nFreeway 7 dangerous at T=14,15, not before or after? Earlier: freeway 7 dangerous at T=6,7,14,15.\n\nT=6 and 7 are past, so for T>7, only T=14,15 dangerous.\n\nSimilarly freeway 8 same.\n\nSo after T=15, safe.\n\nAt T=16, freeway 7 and 8 should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, before T=14, safe except past times.\n\nSo for y=7, safe at T=8,9,10,11,12,13,16,17,... \n\nSimilarly y=8 safe at T=8,9,10,11,12,13,16,17,... except T=6,7,14,15 but T=6,7 are when I am lower.\n\nNow back to the plan.\n\nI can go up to y=7 at T=13.\n\nThen at T=13, I need to avoid being on y=7 or 8 at T=14,15.\n\nSo at T=13, I am on y=7, I can go down to y=6 at T=14.\n\nThen at T=14, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at T=14, I am on y=6, I can choose to stay or move.\n\nIf I go up to y=7 at T=15, but T=15 y=7 dangerous, collision.\n\nIf I stay at y=6 at T=15, then y=6 safe.\n\nBut I need to go up later.\n\nIf I go down to y=5, but that might take more turns.\n\nTo minimize H, I should not go down too much.\n\nSince T=15 is bad, I can stay at y=6 for one turn.\n\nAt T=13: y=7\n\nAction: D (down), so y_{14} = y_13 -1 = 6\n\nAt T=14: y=6, safe (since freeway 6 not dangerous)\n\nThen at T=14, I can choose action.\n\nIf I do S (stay), then y_{15} =6, at T=15 y=6, safe.\n\nThen at T=15, I can go up to y=7 at T=16.\n\nT=16 should be safe for y=7.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nThen proceed up.\n\nBut let's see the time.\n\nFrom start:\n\nT=6: y=0\n\na=U, T=7: y=1\n\na=U, T=8: y=2\n\na=U, T=9: y=3\n\na=U, T=10: y=4\n\na=U, T=11: y=5\n\na=U, T=12: y=6\n\na=U, T=13: y=7  (safe, since T=13 not dangerous for y=7)\n\nNow at T=13, I need to take action. If I go up, y=8 at T=14, bad. So instead, go down: a=D, so y_{14} = y_13 -1 =6\n\nAt T=14: y=6, safe (freeway 6 safe)\n\nNow at T=14, I am on y=6, I can stay: a=S, so y_{15} =6\n\nAt T=15: y=6, safe\n\nThen at T=15, I can go up: a=U, so y_{16} =7\n\nAt T=16: y=7, now is freeway 7 safe at T=16? T=16 is ΔT=10, earlier freeway 7 dangerous only at ΔT=0,1,8,9, so ΔT=10 not dangerous, yes safe.\n\nThen continue: a=U, T=17: y=8\n\nAt T=17: y=8, freeway 8, dangerous? Freeway 8 dangerous at T=6,7,14,15, not T=17 (ΔT=11), safe.\n\nThen a=U, T=18: y=9\n\nAt T=18, y=9, safe, no cars.\n\nNow, how many actions? From T=6 to T=17? Let's list positions and actions.\n\nTurn T | position y_T | action a_T | next y\n\nStart T=6, y=6=0\n\na_6 = U, then T=7, y=1\n\na_7 = U, T=8, y=2\n\na_8 = U, T=9, y=3\n\na_9 = U, T=10, y=4\n\na_10 = U, T=11, y=5\n\na_11 = U, T=12, y=6\n\na_12 = U, T=13, y=7\n\nNow at T=13, y=7, a_13 = D (down), so T=14, y=6\n\nAt T=14, y=6, a_14 = S (stay), so T=15, y=6\n\nAt T=15, y=6, a_15 = U, so T=16, y=7\n\nAt T=16, y=7, a_16 = U, so T=17, y=8\n\nAt T=17, y=8, a_17 = U, so T=18, y=9\n\nNow, I reached y=9 at T=18.\n\nActions from T=6 to T=17, that's 12 actions? T=6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17: that's 12 turns.\n\nBut H is the number of actions, from t=0 to H-1, so here actions at T=6 to T=17, which is 12 actions.\n\nThen position at T=18 is y=9.\n\nBut earlier I thought minimal H=9, but with detour, it's more.\n\nCan I do better?\n\nPerhaps I don't need to go down, but skip the bad time differently.\n\nFor example, if I delay going up initially.\n\nStart at T=6 y=0.\n\nInstead of going up immediately, I stay for some turns, but that might make me later.\n\nSince y=6 is safe, I can stay there during bad times.\n\nIn the above, I went down to y=6 at T=14 and stayed through T=15.\n\nBut I was at y=7 at T=13, then down to y=6 at T=14, stay at T=15, then up to y=7 at T=16.\n\nBut I could have stayed at y=6 earlier.\n\nFor example, go up to y=6 faster, then stay during T=14 and 15.\n\nBut I start from y=0.\n\nEarliest to y=6: from y=0 to y=6 in 6 moves: T=6 y=0, a=U T=7 y=1, ..., up to a=U at T=11, T=12 y=6? Let's see:\n\nT=6: y=0\n\na6=U, T=7 y=1\n\na7=U, T=8 y=2\n\na8=U, T=9 y=3\n\na9=U, T=10 y=4\n\na10=U, T=11 y=5\n\na11=U, T=12 y=6\n\nSo at T=12, y=6.\n\nThen I can stay at y=6 for some turns.\n\nNow, I need to avoid being on y=7 or 8 at T=14,15.\n\nSo I can stay at y=6 until after T=15.\n\nFor example, at T=12, y=6, I can do S (stay), so T=13 y=6\n\nThen at T=13, y=6, do S, T=14 y=6\n\nT=14 y=6, safe.\n\nThen at T=14, y=6, I can do S, T=15 y=6, safe.\n\nThen after T=15, go up.\n\nAt T=15, y=6, a=U, T=16 y=7\n\nT=16 y=7, safe (as before)\n\na=U, T=17 y=8, safe\n\na=U, T=18 y=9.\n\nSame as before: reached at T=18.\n\nBut in this case, I stayed longer at y=6.\n\nSequence:\n\nT=6: y=0, a=U\n\nT=7: y=1, a=U\n\n...\n\nUp to T=11: y=5? Earlier:\n\nT=6: y=0, a=U\n\nT=7: y=1, a=U\n\nT=8: y=2, a=U\n\nT=9: y=3, a=U\n\nT=10: y=4, a=U\n\nT=11: y=5, a=U  → T=12 y=6\n\nAt T=12: y=6, now instead of going up, I stay: a=S, so T=13 y=6\n\nAt T=13: y=6, a=S, T=14 y=6\n\nAt T=14: y=6, a=S, T=15 y=6\n\nAt T=15: y=6, a=U, T=16 y=7\n\nT=16: y=7, a=U, T=17 y=8\n\nT=17: y=8, a=U, T=18 y=9\n\nSame H=12 actions to reach at T=18.\n\nBut earlier with going up and down, also 12.\n\nIn the first detour, I had one extra down and up, but here I have extra stays, similar.\n\nBut perhaps I can go to y=6 later.\n\nMinimal H: since I have to go from 0 to 9, at least 9 moves up, but I need extra moves to avoid the bad times.\n\nThe bad times are T=14,15 for y=7 and 8.\n\nI need to \"waste\" at least two turns somewhere to skip those times.\n\nFor example, if I stay at some row for two extra turns, or go down and up, which also costs two extra actions.\n\nIn both cases, H=11? 9 + 2 =11 actions?\n\nWith 9 actions, I can be at y=9 at T=15, but I couldn't because of T=14.\n\nWith 10 actions, positions from T=6 to T=15? Actions from T=6 to T=14, position at T=15.\n\nIf I can reach y=9 at T=15 with 9 actions, but T=15 is when I arrive, but during the path, at T=14 I was on y=8 which is bad.\n\nWith 10 actions, I might reach later.\n\nSuppose I take 10 actions from T=6 to T=15, position at T=16.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach by T=16 with fewer extra.\n\nSince I must not be on y=7 or 8 at T=14,15, I can be on those rows only at other times.\n\nThe safe times for y=7 are T=8 to 13 and T=16 onwards.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nNow, to minimize H, I should go up as fast as possible to y=6 or something, then jump over the bad times.\n\nFor example, go to y=6 by T=12.\n\nThen from T=12 to T=16, I need to be not on y=7 or 8 during T=14,15.\n\nI can stay at y=6 from T=12 to T=15, then go up.\n\nAt T=12 y=6, a=S T=13 y=6, a=S T=14 y=6, a=S T=15 y=6, then a=U T=16 y=7, a=U T=17 y=8, a=U T=18 y=9. That's 12 actions.\n\nFrom T=12 y=6, I could go to y=7 at T=13 (safe), then since T=14 is coming, I need to leave y=7 before T=14.\n\nBut at T=13 y=7, if I go down to y=6 at T=14, then as before.\n\nThen at T=14 y=6, I can go up to y=7 at T=16? No, at T=14 I take action for T=15.\n\nAt T=14 y=6, I can go up to y=7 at T=15, but T=15 y=7 dangerous.\n\nSo I cannot go up to y=7 at T=15.\n\nI have to stay or go down.\n\nThen go up later.\n\nSo I think I cannot avoid wasting at least two turns.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach earlier by going slower initially.\n\nFor example, start at T=6 y=0, stay for one turn: a=S, T=7 y=0, but y=0 safe, then go up.\n\nBut I start later, so I reach later.\n\nFor example, T=6 y=0, a=S, T=7 y=0\n\nThen a=U, T=8 y=1\n\n...\n\nThen to y=9 at later time.\n\nWorse.\n\nGo down, but y=0 is min, cannot go down.\n\ny=0, D would stay? y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy: U +1, D -1, S 0, and y in [0,9], so at y=0, D would be y=0, I think, since y>=0.\n\nSimilarly at y=9, U stays.\n\nSo I can stay at y=0.\n\nBut staying delays.\n\nTo reach faster, I need to go up.\n\nBut the bottleneck is around y=7,8 at T=14,15.\n\nAnother idea: since y=5,6 are safe, I can be there during T=14,15.\n\nBut to reach y=9, I need to go through 7 and 8.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=8 before T=14.\n\nFor example, be on y=8 at T=13.\n\nT=13, is freeway 8 safe? Earlier, dangerous at T=6,7,14,15, not T=13, so safe.\n\nSimilarly y=7 at T=13 safe.\n\nThen from there, I need to go to y=9.\n\nIf I go up at T=13 from y=8 to y=9 at T=14? At T=13 y=8, a=U, T=14 y=9.\n\nAt T=14, y=9, safe, no cars.\n\nBut at T=13, I am on y=8, which is safe, then move to y=9 at T=14.\n\nNow, during T=13, y=8 safe, T=14 y=9 safe.\n\nBut I need to be at y=8 at T=13.\n\nCan I reach y=8 by T=13?\n\nFrom y=0 at T=6 to y=8 at T=13: that's 7 moves up in 7 turns? From T=6 to T=13 is 7 steps? Positions: T=6 y=0, after 1 action T=7 y=1, after 2 actions T=8 y=2, ..., after k actions, at T=6+k, y=k.\n\nTo be at y=8 at T=13, so T=13 =6+7, so after 7 actions, y=8 at T=13.\n\nThen at T=13, y=8, I take a=U, to y=9 at T=14.\n\nNow, check the path:\n\nT=6: y=0, a=U\n\nT=7: y=1, a=U\n\nT=8: y=2, a=U\n\nT=9: y=3, a=U\n\nT=10: y=4, a=U\n\nT=11: y=5, a=U\n\nT=12: y=6, a=U\n\nT=13: y=7? After 7 actions: actions at T=6 to T=12, 7 actions, position at T=13 is y=7? Let's count:\n\nAfter action at T=6: T=7 y=1\n\nAfter a at T=7: T=8 y=2\n\n...\n\nAfter a at T=12: T=13 y=7? Since from y=6 at T=12, a=U, T=13 y=7.\n\nBut I want y=8 at T=13.\n\nTo have y=8 at T=13, I need to be at y=7 at T=12, then a=U to y=8 at T=13.\n\nAt T=12, position y=12? T=12, y_T.\n\nAt T=12, y=6 if I went straight.\n\nTo be at y=7 at T=12.\n\nT=12 is turn 12.\n\nFrom start: after 0 actions, T=6 y=0\n\nAfter 1 action (T=6), T=7 y=1\n\nAfter 2 actions (T=6,7), T=8 y=2\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at T=6+k, y=k.\n\nSo to have y=7 at T=13, T=13 =6+7, so after 7 actions, y=7 at T=13.\n\nTo have y=8 at T=13, not possible, since at T=13, after actions, y can be at most 7 if I start from 0 with 7 ups.\n\nMaximum y at T=13: start T=6 y=0, after 7 actions (T=6 to T=12), position at T=13 y=7.\n\nCannot be at y=8 at T=13.\n\nEarliest at y=8 is T=14 with 8 actions: after a at T=13, T=14 y=8.\n\nBut T=14 y=8 dangerous.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=8 before T=14 with direct path.\n\nSimilarly, after T=15, at T=16 y=8 with later arrival.\n\nSo I think the minimal H is 11 or 12 with detour.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is a way with H=10.\n\nH=10 actions: from T=6 to T=15, position at T=16.\n\nWith 10 actions, I can go up 10 times, but from y=0, after 10 ups, y=10, but y max 9, so I need to have some down or stay, but to reach y=9, I need net +9, so with 10 actions, I can have 9 up and 1 down or stay, but since y=9 is target, I can arrive with extra actions.\n\nFor example, go up 9 times and one stay somewhere.\n\nBut positions: start T=6 y=0.\n\nAfter 10 actions, at T=16 y=9.\n\nDuring the path, from T=6 to T=15, positions y_T.\n\nI need to avoid y=7 and 8 at T=14,15? T=14 and 15 are within.\n\nAt T=14, if y=7 or 8, bad.\n\nSimilarly T=15.\n\nNow, suppose I go up to y=6 quickly.\n\nAt T=12, y=6 as before.\n\nThen I need to handle T=14 and 15.\n\nIf at T=14, I am on y=6, safe.\n\nT=15 on y=6, safe.\n\nThen go up to y=7 at T=16, etc.\n\nBut to be on y=6 at T=14 and T=15.\n\nAt T=12, y=6, I can stay: a=S at T=12, T=13 y=6\n\na=S at T=13, T=14 y=6\n\na=S at T=14, T=15 y=6\n\nThen a=U at T=15, T=16 y=7\n\na=U T=17 y=8\n\na=U T=18 y=9\n\nBut this requires actions up to T=17 for y=9 at T=18, with 12 actions.\n\nWith H=10 actions, position at T=16.\n\nI need y_16=9.\n\nSince net +9, with 10 actions, I must have 9 up and 1 down or 10 up but y=10 not allowed, so must have at least one down or stay.\n\nBut down would decrease, so to reach y=9, I need more up.\n\nSuppose I have k up, m down, l stay, with k+m+l=10, and y_final = 0 + k - m =9, so k-m=9.\n\nAlso k+m+l=10.\n\nThen k-m=9, k+m=10 - l <=10.\n\nThen 2k = (k-m) + (k+m) =9 + (10-l) =19-l\n\nSimilarly, 2m = (k+m) - (k-m) = (10-l) -9 =1-l\n\nm must be non-negative integer, so 1-l >=0, l>=1.\n\nThen 2k=19-l, so l must be odd, since 2k even.\n\nl>=1.\n\nIf l=1, then 2k=18, k=9, then m=0, but k-m=9, and l=1, total actions 10.\n\nk=9, m=0, l=1, y_final=9.\n\nIf l=3, k=8, m= -0.5? Not integer.\n\n2m=1-l, l=1, 2m=0, m=0.\n\nThen k=9, l=1, m=0.\n\nSo I need 9 up and 1 stay, no down.\n\nWith 10 actions: 9 U and 1 S, reach y=9 at T=16.\n\nNow, I need to place the stay somewhere to avoid the bad positions.\n\nThe path: I start at y=0, go up to y=9 with one stay.\n\nThe stay can be at some row.\n\nNow, the dangerous times are T=14 and 15 for y=7 and 8.\n\nI need to ensure that at T=14, y_T !=7 and !=8, similarly T=15.\n\nAlso, for other times, other rows.\n\nBut other rows are safe except as before.\n\nNow, let’s list the positions over time.\n\nLet s be the time from start, let τ = T - 6, so τ=0 at T=6.\n\nThen at τ=0, y=0.\n\nAfter actions, at time τ, y_τ.\n\nτ from 0 to 10 for the actions? Absolute T=6+τ.\n\nPosition at time T=6+τ.\n\nAfter H actions, at time T=6+H.\n\nFor H=10, at T=16.\n\nPositions: for τ from 0 to 9, y at T=6+τ, and action at τ determines y_{τ+1}.\n\nDefine y_τ for τ=0 to 10, where y_τ is position at time T=6+τ.\n\ny_0 = 0\n\nThen a_τ for τ=0 to 9, y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy(a_τ)\n\nAnd collision at time τ if 1<=y_τ<=8 and freeway y_τ dangerous at time T=6+τ.\n\nWe need y_10 =9.\n\nWith 9 U and 1 S.\n\ny increases only with U, decreases with D, same with S.\n\nTo have y_10=9, since y_0=0, net change +9, so number of U minus number of D must be 9.\n\nWith 10 actions, 9 U and 1 S, so no D, so y increases from 0 to 9, with one stay, so y_τ is non-decreasing, from 0 to 9.\n\nAt some point, I stay at a row for one turn.\n\nNow, the values: y_τ for τ=0 to 10.\n\ny_0=0\n\ny_1: after a0, could be 0 or 1\n\n...\n\ny_10=9\n\nSince 9 U and 1 S, the position y_τ reaches 9 at some point.\n\nThe stay means that for one τ, y_{τ} = y_{τ+1}, and for others y_{τ+1} = y_τ +1.\n\nNow, I need to avoid y_τ=7 or 8 at τ=8 or 9? T=6+τ.\n\nDanger times for y=7 and 8 are at T=14 and 15.\n\nT=14: τ=8 since T=6+τ=14, τ=8\n\nT=15: τ=9\n\nSo at τ=8 and τ=9, I must not be on y=7 or 8.\n\nThat is, at time τ=8 (T=14), y_8 !=7 and y_8 !=8\n\nAt time τ=9 (T=15), y_9 !=7 and y_9 !=8\n\nAlso, y_10=9.\n\nNow, since y is non-decreasing from 0 to 9, and one stay.\n\ny_τ must be integer between 0 and 9.\n\nAt τ=8, y_8 cannot be 7 or 8, so y_8 <=6 or y_8=9.\n\nBut if y_8=9, then since y_10=9, and y non-decreasing, y_9=9, y_10=9, so I must have stayed at y=9 from some point, but y_10=9, so possible if I reach y=9 early.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=9, y_9 cannot be 7 or 8, so y_9 <=6 or y_9=9.\n\nNow, if I reach y=9 early, say at τ=7, y_7=9, then at τ=8, y_8=9, safe since not 7 or 8.\n\nSimilarly τ=9 y_9=9.\n\nBut can I reach y=9 at τ=7?\n\nτ=7, T=13.\n\nTo have y_7=9, from y_0=0, I need 9 increases in 7 actions? At τ=7, after 7 actions, position y_7.\n\nAfter k actions, y at τ=k.\n\nAfter 0 actions, τ=0 y=0\n\nAfter 1 action, τ=1 y=y1\n\n...\n\nAfter 7 actions, at τ=7 y=y7.\n\nTo have y7=9, I need to have increased 9 times in 7 actions, impossible since max increase per action is 1, so y7 <=7.\n\nSimilarly, earliest at y=9 is at τ=9 with 9 actions.\n\nWith actions, at τ=9, after 9 actions, y9 <=9.\n\nWith 9 U, y9=9.\n\nBut here with 10 actions, at τ=10 y10=9.\n\nBut at τ=7, y7 <=7.\n\nSo at τ=8, y8 <=8, since from y7 <=7, after one action, y8 <=8.\n\nSimilarly y8 >= y7 >= ... but y8 <=8.\n\nNow, at τ=8, y8 cannot be 7 or 8, so must be y8 <=6.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=9, y9 cannot be 7 or 8, so y9 <=6 or y9=9.\n\nBut since y10=9, and y non-decreasing, if y9 <=6, then y10 <=7 or something, contradiction.\n\ny9 <=6, then y10 = y9 or y9+1 <=7, but y10=9, impossible.\n\nTherefore, y9 cannot be <=6, must be y9=9.\n\nSimilarly, since y9=9, and y non-decreasing, y10=9.\n\nNow, at τ=9, y9=9, which is not 7 or 8, so safe.\n\nBut at τ=8, y8 must be <=6.\n\nNow, y9=9, so from y8 to y9, since y9= y8 + Δy, with |Δy|<=1, so if y8 <=6, y9 <=7, but y9=9, contradiction unless y8=8 and Δy=+1, but y8 cannot be 8.\n\ny8 <=6, y9 = y8 + a, a=0 or +1 or -1, but since non-decreasing, a=0 or +1.\n\nIf a=0, y9=y8<=6\n\nIf a=+1, y9=y8+1<=7\n\nBut y9=9, so both cases y9<=7<9, impossible.\n\nContradiction.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to have H=10 with y10=9 while avoiding the collisions.\n\nThus, minimal H must be at least 11.\n\nNow with H=11 actions, position at T=17.\n\ny_11=9 at τ=11.\n\nNow, with 11 actions, net +9, so I need 9 U and 2 other actions, which could be S or D, but if D, I need extra U.\n\nLet k U, m D, l S, k + m + l =11, k - m =9.\n\nThen k - m =9, k + m + l =11.\n\nAdd: 2k + l =20, so k=10 - l/2, so l even.\n\nSubtract: 2m + l =2.\n\nSince k - m =9, and k + m + l =11.\n\nThen 2k + l =20, 2m + l =2.\n\nl even, from 2k + l =20.\n\nPossible l=0, then 2k=20, k=10, 2m=2, m=1.\n\nThen 10 U, 1 D, y=9.\n\nOr l=2, then 2k +2=20, 2k=18, k=9, and 2m +2=2, 2m=0, m=0.\n\nThen 9 U, 2 S, y=9.\n\nOr l=4, k=8, but 2m+4=2, 2m=-2, m negative, impossible.\n\nSo possible: (10 U, 1 D) or (9 U, 2 S)\n\nNow, in both cases, I can have extra moves.\n\nTo minimize H, H=11 is better than 12.\n\nNow, with H=11, I need to avoid y=7 or 8 at τ=8 and τ=9 (T=14,15)\n\nThat is, at time τ=8, y_8 !=7,8\n\nAt τ=9, y_9 !=7,8\n\nAnd y_11=9.\n\nFirst case: 9 U and 2 S.\n\ny non-decreasing from 0 to 9 with two stays.\n\nAt τ=8, y_8 <=6 or y_8=9.\n\nBut y_8=9 only if reached early, but y_8 <=8 since after 8 actions, max y=8.\n\nSimilarly, y_8 >= min, but y_8 <=8.\n\nMust y_8 <=6.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=9, y_9 must not be 7 or 8, so y_9 <=6 or y_9=9.\n\nBut since y_11=9, and non-decreasing, if y_9 <=6, then need to increase to 9 by τ=11, with two steps, possible if y_9=6, then y_10=7 or8 or9, but y_10 <= y_9 +1 <=7, then y_11<=8<9, impossible to reach 9.\n\ny_9 <=6, y_10 <=7, y_11<=8<9, contradiction.\n\nTherefore, y_9 must be 9.\n\nThen y_10=9, y_11=9.\n\nNow, at τ=9, y_9=9, safe.\n\nAt τ=8, y_8 must be <=6.\n\nSince y_9=9, and y_8 <=6, then from y_8 to y_9, must have a large increase, but |Δy|<=1, so y_9 <= y_8 +1 <=7, but y_9=9, contradiction.\n\nImpossible with 9 U and 2 S.\n\nNow, other case: 10 U and 1 D.\n\nThen y not necessarily non-decreasing.\n\ny_0=0\n\nAfter 11 actions, y_11=9.\n\nWith 10 U and 1 D, net +9.\n\nNow, positions: y can decrease once.\n\nAt τ=8, y_8 !=7,8\n\nAt τ=9, y_9 !=7,8\n\ny_11=9.\n\nSince y_11=9 with 10 U and 1 D, the D must be compensated.\n\nAt τ=8, y_8 <=8, must be <=6.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=9, y_9 must not be 7 or 8, so <=6 or 9.\n\nBut y_11=9, so if y_9 <=6, then need to reach 9 by τ=11 with two actions, max increase 2, so y_11 <= y_9 +2 <=8<9 if y_9<=6, impossible. Thus y_9 must be 9.\n\nThen y_10=9 or 8, but y_11=9, so if y_10=8, y_11=9 with U; or y_10=9, y_11=9 with S.\n\nBut y_9=9.\n\nThen at τ=9, y_9=9, safe.\n\nNow at τ=8, y_8 must be <=6.\n\nBut y_9=9, so from y_8 to y_9, y_9 = y_8 + Δy, with |Δy|<=1, so y_9 <= y_8 +1 <=7 if y_8<=6, but y_9=9, contradiction.\n\nThus, in all cases for H=11, I have contradiction because y_9=9 required but y_8<=6 implies y_9 <= y_8 +1 <=7.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to have H=11 while avoiding the collisions at T=14 and 15.\n\nThus, minimal H is 12, as I had earlier.\n\nWith H=12, position at T=18 y=9.\n\nAnd I can have a sequence as before.\n\nNow, to write the actions.\n\nFrom the first sequence I thought:\n\nActions:\n\nTurn t1=6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U  (now at T=12 y=6)\n\nTurn 12: U  (to y=7 at T=13)\n\nAt T=13 y=7, safe.\n\nThen to avoid T=14 on y=7 or 8, go down:\n\nTurn 13: D  (to y=6 at T=14)\n\nAt T=14 y=6, safe.\n\nThen stay or go up, but T=15 bad for y=7,8.\n\nSo stay at y=6:\n\nTurn 14: S  (y=6 at T=15)\n\nAt T=15 y=6, safe.\n\nThen go up:\n\nTurn 15: U  (to y=7 at T=16)\n\nTurn 16: U  (to y=8 at T=17)\n\nTurn 17: U  (to y=9 at T=18)\n\nNow, actions from turn 6 to 17, that's 12 actions.\n\nIn terms of the sequence: a_{t1} to a_{t1 +11} for H=12? t from 0 to H-1.\n\nH=12, actions at t=0 to 11, which is turns t1 to t1+11.\n\nt1=6, so turns 6 to 17.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, to write in the answer format.\n\nBut let's confirm all safe.\n\nT=6: y=0, safe\n\nT=7: y=1, freeway 1, not dangerous (danger at 22-25), safe\n\nT=8: y=2, freeway 2, no danger, safe\n\nT=9: y=3, freeway 3, safe\n\nT=10: y=4, freeway 4, safe\n\nT=11: y=5, freeway 5, safe\n\nT=12: y=6, freeway 6, not dangerous (only T=6), safe\n\nT=13: y=7, freeway 7, dangerous at 6,7,14,15; T=13 not, safe\n\nT=14: y=6, freeway 6, safe\n\nT=15: y=6, freeway 6, safe\n\nT=16: y=7, freeway 7, T=16 not dangerous (ΔT=10), safe\n\nT=17: y=8, freeway 8, T=17 not dangerous (ΔT=11), safe\n\nT=18: y=9, safe.\n\nAnd y=9 at T=18.\n\nAll good.\n\nI could have the stay earlier, but H same.\n\nSo minimal H=12.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions for turns 6 to 17.\n\nIn the answer, it should be:\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: D\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nIn the format:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 6: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: & D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: & U \\end{array} }\n\nBut H=12 actions, from turn 6 to 17.\n\nThe problem says \"sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1\"\n\nHere t1=6, H=12, t from 0 to 11, turns 6+0=6 to 6+11=17.\n\nYes.\n\nTo write in the box.\n\nSince the car on freeway 6 at T=6 is dangerous, but I was not on it, and later safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nI think this works.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) is 12, with the sequence of actions avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\).\n\n### Solution Summary:\n- The player starts at \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\).\n- The sequence involves moving up (U) for the first 7 actions to reach \\(y = 7\\) by turn 13.\n- At turn 13, to avoid being on freeway 7 or 8 during the dangerous turns 14 and 15, the player moves down (D) to \\(y = 6\\).\n- At turn 14, the player stays (S) at \\(y = 6\\) to remain safe during turn 15.\n- From turn 15, the player moves up (U) for three consecutive actions to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 18.\n\n### Collision Avoidance:\n- Freeway 6 is dangerous only at turn 6, but the player is on \\(y = 6\\) at turns 12, 14, and 15, which are safe.\n- Freeways 7 and 8 are dangerous at turns 6, 7, 14, and 15.

The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimum number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, respectively, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are on each freeway from 1 to 8. For each car, I'm given its head, tail, direction, and speed at turn t_1=9. The car positions change over time based on their speed and direction.\n\nCollision occurs if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn T. Importantly, when you move to a new y, you're not on that new y until the next turn, so you only check for collisions on the y you're currently on at turn T.\n\nThe car span updates linearly. For left-moving cars, the span shifts left (decreasing x), and for right-moving, it shifts right (increasing x).\n\nAll cars here are right-moving, since direction is \"right\" for all. Let me list them out:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, h=-39, t=-50, d=right, s=3\n\nFor right-moving cars, the span is [τ, h], so tail to head. In the table, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). But for right-moving, head is the front, so if it's moving right, head should be greater than tail. Here for freeway 1, h=-39, t=-50. Since -39 > -50, yes, head is at higher x, so moving right, span [τ, h] = [-50, -39].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nCar update: for right-moving, at time T, span is [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)]\n\nSince t_1=9, so at turn T, time elapsed is (T-9) turns.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all are right-moving here.\n\nCollision if at turn T, player is on freeway k, and 0 is in the span of some car on freeway k at turn T.\n\nThat is, for some car on k, min_span <= 0 <= max_span at turn T.\n\nSince spans are intervals.\n\nNow, player starts at y=3, needs to go to y=9, so must move up at least 6 times, but can move down or stay, but to minimize turns, probably wants to go up as much as possible, but has to avoid collisions.\n\nSince moving down might be necessary to avoid cars, but going down from 3 might not help since 0 is boundary, but y=0 is safe, no cars, only freeways 1-8 have cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways with cars, I assume. The freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which is not on a freeway, so no collision there.\n\nPlayer at y=3 at turn t=9.\n\nNow, I need to find a sequence of actions to reach y=9 in min H, with no collision on any turn when on y=1 to 8.\n\nSince we start at y=3, and cars are on y=1 to 8, we need to be careful when on those rows.\n\nNow, let's list the car positions over time.\n\nFirst, for each freeway, the cars and their spans at turn T.\n\nSince the cars move continuously, but we care about when 0 is in span.\n\nFor a given freeway k, and car on it, the times when 0 is in its span.\n\nThat is, when min_span <= 0 <= max_span.\n\nFor a right-moving car with initial span [τ, h] at t_1=9, speed s.\n\nAt time T, span is [τ + s(T-9), h + s(T-9)]\n\nThen 0 is in span if τ + s(T-9) <= 0 <= h + s(T-9)\n\nSince τ <= h for right-moving, as head is front.\n\nIn notation, for freeway 1: head h=-39, tail τ=-50, so [τ, h] = [-50, -39], s=3.\n\nSo at T, span: [-50 + 3(T-9), -39 + 3(T-9)]\n\n0 in span if -50 + 3(T-9) <= 0 <= -39 + 3(T-9)\n\nLet’s solve inequalities.\n\nLeft: -50 + 3(T-9) <= 0 => 3(T-9) <= 50 => T-9 <= 50/3 ≈ 16.666, so T <= 9 + 16.666 = 25.666, so T <= 25 since T integer? Turns are discrete, I think T integer.\n\nSimilarly, right: 0 <= -39 + 3(T-9) => 39 <= 3(T-9) => T-9 >= 13, so T >= 22.\n\nFrom left: -50 + 3(T-9) <= 0 => 3(T-9) <= 50 => T-9 <= 50/3 = 16 + 2/3, so since T integer, T-9 <= 16, so T <= 25.\n\nFrom right: 0 <= -39 + 3(T-9) => 39 <= 3(T-9) => T-9 >= 13, so T >= 22.\n\nThus, 0 in span for T from 22 to 25 inclusive.\n\nT=22,23,24,25.\n\nNow, similarly for other freeways.\n\nBut freeway 1 has only one car.\n\nNow freeway 2: cars: (-36,-47,right,12)\n\nh=-36, τ=-47? Head and tail.\n\nIn table: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor freeway 2: (-36, -47, right, 12)\n\nSince right-moving, span [τ, h] = [-47, -36], s=12.\n\nAt T: [-47 + 12(T-9), -36 + 12(T-9)]\n\n0 in span if -47 + 12(T-9) <= 0 <= -36 + 12(T-9)\n\nLeft: -47 + 12(T-9) <= 0 => 12(T-9) <= 47 => T-9 <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916, so T <= 9 + 3 = 12? 47/12=3.916, so T-9 <= 3.916, since T integer, T-9 <= 3, T <= 12.\n\nT-9 <= floor(47/12) but 47/12=3.916, so T-9 <= 3 for <=0? Let's be precise.\n\n-47 + 12(T-9) <= 0 => 12(T-9) <= 47 => T-9 <= 47/12 = 3 + 11/12, so for integer T, T-9 <= 3, since if T-9=4, 12*4=48>47, -47+48=1>0, not <=0.\n\nThe inequality is <= for the left bound.\n\n0 in span if min <= 0 <= max.\n\nmin <= 0 and 0 <= max.\n\nSo min <= 0: -47 + 12(T-9) <= 0 => 12(T-9) <= 47 => T-9 <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916, so T-9 <= 3 since T integer? T-9 <= 3, then min <=0? If T-9=3, min = -47 +12*3 = -47+36= -11 <=0, true.\n\nIf T-9=4, min= -47+48=1 >0, not <=0, so min <=0 only if T-9 <=3.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= max: 0 <= -36 +12(T-9) => 36 <= 12(T-9) => 12(T-9) >=36? 0 <= -36 +12(T-9) => 36 <= 12(T-9) => T-9 >= 36/12 =3.\n\nSo T-9 >=3.\n\nThus from min<=0: T-9 <=3\n\nFrom 0<=max: T-9 >=3\n\nSo T-9=3, T=12.\n\nOnly at T=12.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? (-36,-47,right,12), identical to freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: same, (-36,-47,right,12)\n\nFreeway 5: same, (-36,-47,right,12)\n\nFreeway 6: two cars: (-36,-47,right,12) and (36,25,right,12)\n\nFirst car: same as above, but let's see.\n\nFreeway 6 has two cars: one is (-36,-47,right,12) and (36,25,right,12)\n\nFor (36,25,right,12): head=36, tail=25? But for right-moving, if head=36, tail=25, then span [25,36], since τ=25, h=36.\n\nAt T: [25 +12(T-9), 36 +12(T-9)]\n\n0 in span? min=25 +12(T-9), which for T>=9, min>=25>0, so min>0, 0 cannot be <= min, so 0 not in span. Similarly max=36+12(T-9)>0, but since min>0, 0 < min, so not in span. So this car never has 0 in span, since both ends positive and increasing.\n\nSimilarly, the other car on freeway 6: (-36,-47,right,12), same as before, which has 0 in span only at T=12.\n\nBut since it's the same as freeway 2, at T=12 only.\n\nBut freeway 6 has two cars, but the second one never covers 0, so only the first one matters, and it causes collision at T=12 on freeway 6.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars: (-30,-41,right,6) and (18,7,right,6)\n\nFirst car: (-30,-41,right,6), so [τ,h] = [-41,-30], s=6.\n\nAt T: [-41 +6(T-9), -30 +6(T-9)]\n\n0 in span if -41 +6(T-9) <=0 <= -30 +6(T-9)\n\nLeft: -41 +6(T-9) <=0 => 6(T-9) <=41 => T-9 <= 41/6 ≈6.833, so T-9 <=6, T<=15\n\nRight: 0 <= -30 +6(T-9) => 30 <=6(T-9) => T-9 >=5, T>=14\n\nSo T from 14 to 15 inclusive? T-9 >=5 and T-9 <=6, so T=14 or 15.\n\nT-9 >=5, T>=14; T-9 <=6, T<=15. So T=14,15.\n\nSecond car on freeway 7: (18,7,right,6), [7,18] at t=9.\n\nAt T: [7+6(T-9), 18+6(T-9)]\n\nmin=7+6(T-9) >=7>0 for T>=9, so min>0, 0 not in span. So only first car matters.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same as freeway 7? (-30,-41,right,6) and (18,7,right,6), identical.\n\nSo for freeway 8, same as 7, collision at T=14,15.\n\nNow freeway 1 we did: collision at T=22,23,24,25.\n\nFreeway 2: only T=12\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2, T=12\n\nFreeway 4: same, T=12\n\nFreeway 5: same, T=12\n\nFreeway 6: with the car (-36,-47,right,12), T=12\n\nAnd freeway 7: T=14,15\n\nFreeway 8: T=14,15\n\nBut freeways 2,3,4,5,6 all have collision at T=12 only? Freeway 6 has two cars but only one affects, at T=12.\n\nFreeways 2,3,4,5 each have one car causing T=12.\n\nBut since each freeway is separate, we need to consider per freeway the dangerous times.\n\nSummarize dangerous times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: dangerous at T=22,23,24,25\n\n- y=2: dangerous at T=12\n\n- y=3: dangerous at T=12\n\n- y=4: dangerous at T=12\n\n- y=5: dangerous at T=12\n\n- y=6: dangerous at T=12 (from first car)\n\n- y=7: dangerous at T=14,15\n\n- y=8: dangerous at T=14,15\n\nNow, player starts at t=9, y=3.\n\nWe need to go to y=9, which is safe.\n\nThe minimal number of moves: since we need to increase y from 3 to 9, minimum 6 up moves, but we might need to stay or move down to avoid being on a dangerous freeway at dangerous times.\n\nBut moving down might delay, so probably better to go up directly if possible, but check the times.\n\nFirst, the dangerous times are clustered: at T=12 for y=2,3,4,5,6; and T=14,15 for y=7,8; and T=22-25 for y=1, but y=1 is low, we start from y=3, going up, so y=1 might not be relevant, but we could move down, but since we want to go up, moving down might not be efficient.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 is safe.\n\nNow, from y=3 at t=9.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe fastest way is to go up every turn, but we might be on dangerous rows at dangerous times.\n\nFor example, if we go up from t=9 to t=14: let's see positions.\n\nAt t=9: y=3\n\nAfter action at t=9, move to y=4 at t=10? Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on action a_t.\n\nAt turn t, we take action a_t, then at the end of turn, position updates to y_{t+1}.\n\nAnd collision is checked at turn T when we are on y_T.\n\nSo at turn T, we are on position y_T.\n\nThen we take action a_T, go to y_{T+1} at next turn.\n\nAnd at turn T, if we are on y_T, which is between 1 and 8, we check if 0 is in span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nNow, from start: t=9, y=3.\n\nWe take action a_9, which determines y_{10}, and so on.\n\nGoal is to have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, and we start at t_1=9, so after H-1 actions? Let's see the sequence.\n\nWe have actions from t=9 to t=9+H-1, so H actions? Define.\n\nThe sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so actions at time t_1 + t for t=0,1,2,...,H-1.\n\nAfter these actions, the position after last action is y_{t_1 + H}, I think.\n\nStart at turn t_1, position (0, y_{t_1})\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, position y_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 +1}, y_{t_1 +2} = y_{t_1 +1} + Δy_{t_1 +1}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, we have y_{t_1 + H}\n\nAnd we want y_{t_1 + H} =9? No.\n\nThe task: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\" let's read.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nReach at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nSo at turn T = t_1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nAnd actions from t= t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, with H turns? H is the number of turns or actions?\n\n\"minimal number of turns H\" and sequence for t=0 to H-1, so H actions over H turns? A bit confusing.\n\nTypically, from turn t_1, after k actions, we are at turn t_1 + k.\n\nAt turn t_1, position is given, before any action.\n\nThen we take action a_{t_1}, which affects y_{t_1 +1}, and so on.\n\nAfter taking action a_{t_1 + k} at turn t_1 + k, we get y_{t_1 + k +1}.\n\nWe want at some turn T, position (0,9).\n\nThe turn when we reach (0,9) is T.\n\nThen T = t_1 + H -1, so H-1 actions? Let's set t_1 =9.\n\nStart: turn 9, position y_9 =3\n\nTake action a_9, then y_{10} = y_9 + Δy_9\n\nTake action a_{10}, y_{11} = y_{10} + Δy_{10}, and so on.\n\nAfter taking action a_{t}, we get y_{t+1}.\n\nWe want for some t, y_t =9? No, position at turn t is y_t.\n\nAt turn t, position is (0, y_t)\n\nWe want at turn T, y_T =9.\n\nAfter we take actions, the position is updated at each turn.\n\nThe sequence: at turn t_1, we are at y_{t_1}, then we take action a_{t_1}, which determines y_{t_1 +1}, then at turn t_1 +1, we are at y_{t_1 +1}, take a_{t_1 +1}, get y_{t_1 +2}, and so on, until at turn t_1 + H -1, we have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAnd we take actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, which is H actions.\n\nFor example, if we take no action, at turn t_1, y_{t_1}, but we need to reach y=9, so we need actions.\n\nMinimal H means min number of actions to reach y=9 from y=3, which is at least 6, since each U increases y by 1, and y from 3 to 9, diff 6.\n\nBut we might have S or D, which don't increase, so H >=6.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nPlayer at y=3 at turn 9.\n\nDangerous times for y=3: T=12, since freeway 3 dangerous at T=12.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 at T=12, etc.\n\nIf we go up directly:\n\nSuppose actions all U from t=9 onwards.\n\nThen:\n\nt=9: y=3, take a9=U, so y10 =4\n\nBut at turn t, position y_t, so at turn 9, y9=3.\n\nTake a9=U, so y10 =3 +1 =4\n\nThen at turn 10, position y10=4\n\nTake a10=U, y11=5\n\nTurn 11: y11=5\n\na11=U, y12=6\n\nTurn 12: y12=6\n\nNow, at turn 12, y=6, which is freeway 6, dangerous at T=12, so collision if on y=6 at T=12.\n\nYes, so collision.\n\nIf we go up, at turn 12 we are on y=6, which is dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, if we start later or something.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on dangerous freeways at dangerous times.\n\nNow, the dangerous times are:\n\n- For y=2,3,4,5,6: dangerous only at T=12\n\n- y=7 and 8: dangerous at T=14 and 15\n\n- y=1: dangerous at T=22-25, but we are going up, so y=1 is below, probably not issue.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nNow, since we start at y=3 at t=9, and need to go to y=9.\n\nThe critical part is around t=12 and t=14,15.\n\nTo avoid collision on y=6 at t=12, we should not be on y=6 at turn 12.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nPossible ways: either be not on y=6 at t=12, or on a different row, or on a row that is not dangerous at that time.\n\nBut at t=12, y=2,3,4,5,6 are all dangerous, so we should not be on any of them at t=12.\n\ny=2,3,4,5,6 are all dangerous at t=12.\n\ny=1 is not dangerous at t=12, but y=1 at t=12: freeway 1 dangerous only at 22-25, so at t=12, y=1 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at t=12: freeway 7 dangerous at t=14,15, not at t=12, so safe at t=12.\n\ny=8 safe at t=12.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nSo at t=12, safe rows: y=0,1,7,8,9\n\nDangerous: y=2,3,4,5,6\n\nSimilarly, at t=14 and 15, y=7 and 8 are dangerous, so safe rows: y=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,9? y=6 at t=14: freeway 6 dangerous only at t=12, not at t=14, so y=6 is safe at t=14.\n\nSimilarly, y=5,4,etc. safe except y=7 and 8 at t=14,15.\n\nNow, we start at t=9, y=3.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at some turn T.\n\nTo minimize H, we want T as small as possible.\n\nEarliest possible: if no cars, we can reach y=9 at turn 9+6=15? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 9, y9=3\n\nAfter 1 up: turn 10, y10=4\n\nAfter 2 up: turn 11, y11=5\n\nAfter 3 up: turn 12, y12=6\n\nBut at turn 12, y12=6 dangerous, collision.\n\nSo cannot be on y=6 at turn 12.\n\nSimilarly, if we go up to y=5 at turn 11, then if we stay or something.\n\nBut at turn 12, if we are on y=5, which is dangerous.\n\nSimilarly y=4,3,2 all dangerous at t=12.\n\nSo to avoid collision at t=12, we must not be on y=2,3,4,5,6 at turn 12.\n\nThat means at turn 12, we must be on y=0,1,7,8,9.\n\nBut we start from y=3 at t=9.\n\nNow, from t=9 to t=12, we have 3 actions: a9, a10, a11, which determine y10, y11, y12.\n\ny12 depends on actions.\n\ny9=3\n\nAfter a9, y10 = y9 + Δy9\n\nAfter a10, y11 = y10 + Δy10\n\nAfter a11, y12 = y11 + Δy11\n\nThen at turn 12, position y12.\n\nWe need y12 not in {2,3,4,5,6}, so y12 in {0,1,7,8,9}\n\nBut y is between 0 and 9.\n\nNow, from y9=3, in three moves, we can reach various y.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0,+1.\n\nSo from y=3, after three actions, y12 can be from 3-3=0 to 3+3=6, so y12 in {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}\n\nWe need y12 in {0,1,7,8,9}, but 7,8,9 not possible in three moves from 3, since max +3 is 6.\n\nSo possible y12: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6\n\nAnd we need it in {0,1}, since 7,8,9 not achievable.\n\n{0,1} are possible.\n\nFor example, if we move down three times: a9=D, y10=2; a10=D, y11=1; a11=D, y12=0\n\nOr a9=D, y10=2; a10=S, y11=2; a11=D, y12=1\n\nOr a9=S, y10=3; a10=D, y11=2; a11=D, y12=1\n\netc., so y12=0 or 1 possible.\n\nBut we want to go up to 9, so going down to 0 or 1 might delay.\n\nAfter avoiding t=12, we need to go up.\n\nAlso, later at t=14,15, y=7 and 8 dangerous.\n\nNow, if we are at y=0 or 1 at t=12, then we need to go up to 9.\n\ny=0 at t=12, then to reach y=9, need at least 9 up moves, but we can start from there.\n\nBut let's see the time.\n\nFirst, to avoid t=12 collision, we must be at y=0 or 1 at turn 12.\n\nNow, from t=9, y=3, to be at y=0 or 1 at t=12.\n\nFor example:\n\nOption: go down to y=1 at t=12.\n\nThen from there, go up to y=9.\n\nBut need to avoid other dangers.\n\nSince at t=12, y=7 and 8 are safe, but we can't reach them from y=3 in three moves.\n\ny=7: from y=3, min moves to y=7 is 4 up, but in three moves max to 6.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=7 or above at t=12.\n\nSo only y=0 or 1 at t=12.\n\nNow, similarly, we need to reach y=9.\n\nAfter t=12, we are at y12, say y12=1 (to save time, better than 0).\n\nThen from y12=1 at turn 12, we need to go to y=9.\n\nEach U increases y by one, so min 8 moves to y=20? y=1 to y=9, difference 8, so min 8 up moves, but we can do it in more if we stay or down, but min is 8 actions to reach y=9 from y=1.\n\nAt turn 12, y=1\n\nAfter a12=U, y13=2\n\na13=U, y14=3\n\n...\n\nBut we have dangers at t=14 and 15 for y=7 and 8.\n\nIf we go directly up from y=1 at t=12:\n\nt=12: y=1\n\na12=U, y13=2\n\nt=13: y=2\n\na13=U, y14=3\n\nt=14: y=3\n\nAt t=14, y=3, which is freeway 3, but dangerous? Freeway 3 dangerous only at t=12, not at t=14, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 at t=13: freeway 2 dangerous only at t=12, not t=13, so safe.\n\nContinue: a14=U, y15=4\n\nt=15: y=4\n\na15=U, y16=5\n\nt=16: y=5\n\na16=U, y17=6\n\nt=17: y=6\n\na17=U, y18=7\n\nt=18: y=7\n\nNow at t=18, y=7, freeway 7 dangerous at t=14,15, not t=18, so safe.\n\nThen a18=U, y19=8\n\nt=19: y=8, dangerous? Freeway 8 dangerous at t=14,15, not t=19, safe.\n\na19=U, y20=9\n\nt=20: y=9, reached.\n\nBut at which turn? At turn 20, y=9.\n\nNow, we started at t=9, reached at t=20, so H-1 =20? T = t_1 + H -1 =9 + H -1 =20, so 8 + H =20, H=12? Let's count actions.\n\nStart: turn 9, y=3\n\nActions: from a9 to a19, 11 actions? Let's list:\n\nt=9: take a9, to y10\n\n...\n\nt=19: take a19, to y20=9\n\nThen at turn 20, position y20=9.\n\nWe reach at turn 20.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=9 to t=19, 11 actions? t from 9 to 19 inclusive, 11 turns? Actions at times 9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19: that's 11 actions.\n\nThen y20=9 at turn 20.\n\nNow t_1 + H -1 =20, t_1=9, so 9 + H -1 =20, H-1=11, H=12? H is the number of turns? The minimal number of turns H.\n\nIn the task: \"minimal number of turns H\" and \"reach at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nSo if reach at turn T, T= t_1 + H -1.\n\nHere T=20, t_1=9, so 20 = 9 + H -1 => 20=8+H, H=12.\n\nBut the actions are from t=9 to t=19, which is 11 actions, but H=12 turns? I think H includes the starting turn or not.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\n\"minimal number of turns H\" and \"sequence of actions for t=0 to H-1\" relative to t_1.\n\nSet t_1=9.\n\nTurn sequence: turn t_1, t_1+1, ..., up to when we reach.\n\nAt turn t_1, we are at position, no action taken yet.\n\nThen we take action a_{t_1} at turn t_1, which updates to position at turn t_1+1.\n\nAfter taking action a_{t_1 + k} at turn t_1 + k, we get position at turn t_1 + k +1.\n\nWe want position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be (0,9).\n\nFor example, if we do nothing, at turn t_1, position is given, but we need to reach (0,9), so we must take actions.\n\nIf we take action at turn t_1, we get new position at turn t_1+1.\n\nSo to have position at some turn T be (0,9), T must be at least t_1, and if T=t_1, it means we are already at (0,9) at turn t_1, but here we are at (0,3), so T > t_1.\n\nThe turn when we are at (0,9) is T.\n\nThen T = t_1 + H -1 for some H.\n\nSince at turn t_1, we are at y=3, to reach y=9, min T is t_1 +6, if we go up each time.\n\nBut with cars, it may be later.\n\nIn this case, T=20.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nIn the above, we went down to y=1 at t=12, then up slowly.\n\nBut we can avoid going down by waiting or something.\n\nFor example, at t=9, y=3, instead of going up, we stay or go down to avoid being on dangerous rows at t=12.\n\nBut at t=12, we need to be on y=0 or 1.\n\nSince we are at y=3, we can go down to y=1 by t=12.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt t=9, y=3, take a9=D, then y10=2\n\nt=10: y=2, take a10=D, y11=1\n\nt=11: y=1, take a11=S, y12=1? Or a11=D to y12=0, but better to stay at 1.\n\nSo a11=S, y12=1\n\nThen at t=12, y=1, safe.\n\nThen from there, we need to go up.\n\nBut at t=14,15, y=7 and 8 are dangerous, so we should not be on y=7 or 8 at t=14 or 15.\n\nIn the direct up path from y=1:\n\nt=12: y=1\n\na12=U, y13=2\n\nt=13: y=2\n\na13=U, y14=3\n\nt=14: y=3, safe (since y=3 not dangerous at t=14)\n\na14=U, y15=4\n\nt=15: y=4, safe\n\na15=U, y16=5\n\nt=16: y=5, safe\n\na16=U, y17=6\n\nt=17: y=6, safe (y=6 dangerous only at t=12)\n\na17=U, y18=7\n\nt=18: y=7, safe (dangerous at 14,15 only)\n\na18=U, y19=8\n\nt=19: y=8, safe\n\na19=U, y20=9\n\nt=20: y=9\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut to reach faster, we need to be at higher y earlier, but we had to avoid t=12.\n\nSince at t=12, we are forced to be low, then we go up slowly.\n\nBut perhaps we can be at y=7 or 8 at t=12, but impossible from y=3 in 3 moves.\n\nAnother idea: go up slowly before t=12, so that at t=12 we are at y=0 or 1, but then after t=12, go up faster.\n\nBut from y=1, min to y=9 is 8 moves, so turn 20 is earliest.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=9 before t=12, but from t=9 y=3, to y=9, min 6 moves, so at turn 15: t=9 to t=15.\n\nt=9: y=3\n\nIf all U: a9=U, y10=4\n\na10=U, y11=5\n\na11=U, y12=6\n\nBut at t=12, y=6 dangerous, collision.\n\nIf we go up but slower, but to reach y=9 by t=15, we need to be at y=9 at turn 15.\n\nAt turn 15, position y15=9.\n\nThen actions from t=9 to t=14? Let's see.\n\nTo have y15=9.\n\ny9=3\n\ny10 = y9 + Δy9\n\n...\n\ny15 = y14 + Δy14\n\nAnd y15=9.\n\nSince we start from y9=3, to y15=9, difference 6, so we need exactly 6 up moves and no down or stay, but if we have S or D, we need more moves.\n\nTo reach y15=9 from y9=3 in 6 steps (actions from t=9 to t=14, 5 actions? Actions affect next position.\n\nPositions: y9, y10, y11, y12, y13, y14, y15\n\nDetermined by actions a9 to a14.\n\na9 determines y10 from y9\n\na10 determines y11 from y10\n\n...\n\na14 determines y15 from y14\n\nSo for y15 to be 9, with y9=3, we have 6 steps (y10 to y15), each can increase, decrease, or stay.\n\nThe net increase must be +6, so number of U minus number of D must be 6, and number of S can be anything, but each S or D delays.\n\nMin actions to achieve net +6 is 6 actions, all U.\n\nBut with actions a9 to a14, that's 6 actions, leading to y10 to y15.\n\nIf all a9 to a14 are U, then y10=4, y11=5, y12=6, y13=7, y14=8, y15=9.\n\nThen at turn 12, y12=6, which is dangerous, collision.\n\nIf we have some stay or down, we might avoid, but at turn 12, if we are not on y=2-6.\n\nFor example, at turn 12, y12 must be 0,1,7,8,9.\n\nBut if we want y15=9, and y9=3, with 6 actions.\n\nIf y12=7, for example.\n\ny12=7, then from y9=3 to y12=7 in 3 actions (a9,a10,a11), which requires net +4 in 3 moves, impossible since max +3. Min y12 is 0, max 6.\n\nSimilarly, y12=8 or 9 impossible.\n\ny12=0 or 1 possible, but then from y12=1 to y15=9, need net +8 in 3 actions, impossible, max +3 to y14=4, then y15=5 max.\n\nIf y12=1, then after a12, y13; a13, y14; a14, y15.\n\ny13 <= y12 +1 =2, y14<=3, y15<=4 <9.\n\nCannot reach y15=9 if y12=1.\n\nSimilarly, if y12=0, worse.\n\nSo it is impossible to reach y=9 by turn 15 or earlier because at turn 12 we must be low or collide, and from low we can't reach high by 15.\n\nTurn 15 is possible only if we can be on y=9 at turn 15, but to do that, we need to be at y=12? No.\n\nAt turn 15, position y15.\n\nTo have y15=9, from y9=3, with 6 steps (y10 to y15), we need at least 6 up moves in the actions a9 to a14.\n\nBut actions a9 to a14 affect y10 to y15.\n\nSpecifically, the values y10,y11,y12,y13,y14 depend on previous actions.\n\nBut for y15=9, we must have y14 such that with a14, y15=y14 + Δy14, so if a14=U, y15=y14+1, so y14=8; if a14=S, y15=y14, so y14=9; if a14=D, y15=y14-1, so y14=10 impossible. So to have y15=9, y14 must be 8,9, or10 but 10 invalid, so y14=8 or9, and a14=U or S accordingly.\n\nSimilarly, y14 depends on y13 and a13, and so on.\n\nBut net, from y9=3 to y15=9, increase of 6, with 6 actions (a9 to a14), each action can contribute +1,0,-1 to the increase.\n\nSo the sum of Δy from a9 to a14 must be +6.\n\nEach Δy is +1,0,-1, so to have sum +6, we need exactly 6 U and no S or D, so all actions must be U.\n\nThen y10=4, y11=5, y12=6, y13=7, y14=8, y15=9.\n\nThen at turn 12, y12=6, dangerous, collision.\n\nIf we have some S or D, we cannot reach y15=9 with 6 actions; it would require more actions.\n\nFor example, if one S, then to have net +6, we need 7 actions, etc.\n\nSo with 6 actions, only all U, but collision at t=12.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to reach y=9 by turn 15.\n\nSimilarly, turn 16: y16=9.\n\nThen from y9=3 to y16=9, net +6 with 7 actions (a9 to a15).\n\na9 to a15 determine y10 to y16.\n\n7 actions for net +6, so possible with 6U and 1S, or 7U and one D but then net less, etc.\n\nBut we also need to avoid collision at t=12.\n\nAt turn 12, y12 must not be in {2,3,4,5,6}.\n\nNow, for y16=9.\n\ny9=3\n\ny10 =3 + Δy9\n\ny11= y10 + Δy10\n\n...\n\ny16= y15 + Δy15\n\ny16=9.\n\nNet increase from y9 to y16 is +6 over 7 steps? Positions from y10 to y16, 7 positions, but determined by actions.\n\nThe values y10 to y16 are set by actions a9 to a15.\n\na9 sets y10, a10 sets y11, ..., a15 sets y16.\n\nSo with 7 actions, we have y10 to y16.\n\ny9 is fixed, y10 depends only on a9, etc.\n\nTo have y16=9, and y9=3, the sum of Δy from a9 to a15 must be +6.\n\nEach Δy in {-1,0,1}, so sum of 7 terms = +6, so for example, 6U and 1S, or 7U and 1D but net +5, not +6, so must be 6U and 1S, or 5U and 2S and something, but let's see the number: let U count +1, S count 0, D count -1.\n\nSum of 7 actions: let u,s,d be number of U,S,D, u+s+d=7, u - d =6 (since net +6).\n\nThen from u - d =6 and u+s+d=7, add: 2u + s =13, so possible (u,s,d): since 2u+s=13, u max 6, s min 1, e.g. u=6,s=1,d=0; u=5,s=3,d=0? 2*5 +3=13, d=0; u=4,s=5,d=0; etc. or with d, but u-d=6, if d=1, u=7, but u=7,d=1,s=0? u+s+d=7+0+1=8>7, impossible. u+s+d=7.\n\nIf d=0, u+s=7, u=6, s=1; or u=5,s=2? 2u+s=10+s=13, s=3, u=5,s=3,d=0; u=4,s=5,d=0; u=3,s=7,d=0 but s=7, u=3, net u-d=3<6; not.\n\n2u+s=13, with u+s+d=7, d=0 since u-d=6>0.\n\nSo d=0, u+s=7, 2u+s=13, subtract, u=6, then s=1.\n\nSo only possibility: 6U and 1S in the 7 actions.\n\nNow, we need to place the actions so that at turn 12, y12 not in {2,3,4,5,6}.\n\ny12 depends on the actions.\n\ny9=3\n\ny10 = 3 + Δy9\n\ny11 = y10 + Δy10\n\ny12 = y11 + Δy11\n\nNow, y12 must be <=1 or >=7, but since we start from 3 and have U and S, y12 <= 3 + 3 =6 (if all U to y12), or less if S or D, but no D, so y12 <=6, and since we can have S, y12 could be less.\n\nFor example, if all U, y10=4, y11=5, y12=6\n\nBut y12=6 dangerous.\n\nIf we have S at some point, y12 could be lower.\n\nFor instance, if a9=S, then y10=3 (since Δy=0)\n\nThen a10=U, y11=4\n\na11=U, y12=5\n\nStill y12=5, dangerous.\n\na9=U, y10=4\n\na10=S, y11=4\n\na11=U, y12=5, dangerous.\n\na9=U, y10=4\n\na10=U, y11=5\n\na11=S, y12=5, dangerous.\n\nAny sequence with actions up to a11, y12 will be at least 3 (if all S or down, but no down, so min y12=3 if all S, but we have U, so y12 >=3 and <=6.\n\nSpecifically, since net to y12 from y9: with 3 actions, Δy sum for a9,a10,a11 determines y12 - y9.\n\ny12 = y9 + Δy9 + Δy10 + Δy11\n\nSince each Δy <=1, y12 <=3+1+1+1=6\n\nEach Δy >=0 since no D, so y12 >=3.\n\nSo y12 between 3 and 6 inclusive, all of which are dangerous at t=12.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to avoid collision at t=12 if we are at turn 12 with y in 3-6, which we must be.\n\nThus, for any path, at turn 12, we must be on y=0,1, or 7,8,9 but 7-9 impossible from y=3 in 3 moves with no down, so only possible to be on y=0 or 1 by moving down.\n\nTherefore, we must be at low y at t=12, then go up, reaching y=9 at turn 20 as before.\n\nBut turn 20 is for y=9.\n\nIn the sequence I had, turn 20.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier by going up after t=12 faster, but from y=1 at t=12, min to y=9 is 8 moves, so turn 20.\n\nBut let's confirm the turn.\n\nStart: turn 9, y=3\n\nTo be at y=1 at turn 12.\n\nFor example: at t=9, take a9=D, y10=2\n\nt=10: y=2, take a10=D, y11=1\n\nt=11: y=1, take a11=S, y12=1\n\nThen t=12: y=1, safe.\n\nNow, from here, we go up.\n\nBut at t=14,15, y=7 and 8 dangerous, so we need to not be on y=7 or 8 at t=14 or 15.\n\nFrom t=12, y=1\n\nWe can go up directly, but let's see when we hit y=7 and 8.\n\nIf all U:\n\na12=U, y13=2\n\nt=13: y=2\n\na13=U, y14=3\n\nt=14: y=3, safe\n\na14=U, y15=4\n\nt=15: y=4, safe\n\na15=U, y16=5\n\nt=16: y=5\n\na16=U, y17=6\n\nt=17: y=6\n\na17=U, y18=7\n\nt=18: y=7, now t=18, not 14 or 15, safe\n\na18=U, y19=8\n\nt=19: y=8, safe\n\na19=U, y20=9\n\nt=20: y=9\n\nReached at turn 20.\n\nTo reach earlier, we need to be higher sooner.\n\nBut from t=12 at y=1, we can't be at y=7 before t=19? t=12 y=1, after 6U: y13=2,t13; y14=3,t14; y15=4,t15; y16=5,t16; y17=6,t17; y18=7,t18; so at turn 18, y=7.\n\nThen to y=9 at turn 20.\n\nIf we want y=9 at turn 19, then from y12=1, we need y19=9.\n\nWith actions a12 to a18, 7 actions? a12 to a18 determine y13 to y19.\n\ny13 to y19, 7 positions.\n\ny12=1, y19=9, net +8 with 7 actions.\n\nBut each action max +1, so max y19=1+7=8<9, impossible to reach y=9 by turn 19 from y12=1.\n\nSimilarly, turn 18: y18=9, from y12=1, net +8 with 6 actions (a12 to a17), max y18=1+6=7<9, impossible.\n\nSo turn 20 is the earliest possible.\n\nBut is there a way to be at higher y at t=12?\n\nFor example, if we go up initially but then down, but from y=3, we can go up to y=4 or 5, but then to avoid t=12, we need to go down to y=1 or 0 by t=12.\n\nFor example: at t=9, a9=U, y10=4\n\nThen to be low at t=12, we need to go down.\n\na10=D, y11=3\n\na11=D, y12=2? But y12=2 dangerous at t=12.\n\nNot good.\n\na10=D, y11=3\n\na11=D, y12=2, dangerous.\n\na10=S, y11=4\n\na11=D, y12=3, dangerous.\n\nTo reach y=1 at t=12, from y10=4, need a10 and a11 both D: a10=D, y11=3; a11=D, y12=2, not 1.\n\ny12=2, dangerous.\n\nFrom y9=3, if a9=S, y10=3; then a10=D, y11=2; a11=D, y12=1, which is what we had.\n\nSo we can be at y=1 at t=12.\n\nIf we do a9=D, y10=2; a10=D, y11=1; a11=S, y12=1.\n\nSame.\n\nNow, but we have to consider the other dangerous times.\n\nIn the above path, when going up, at t=14 and 15, we are at y=3 and y=4, which are safe at that time.\n\ny=7 and 8 at t=18 and 19, safe.\n\nBut is there a freeway at y=9? No, y=9 is not a freeway, safe.\n\nBut we need to reach (0,9), which we do at turn 20.\n\nBut H: reach at turn t_1 + H -1 =20, t_1=9, so 9 + H -1 =20, H-1=11, H=12? H=12 turns.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =20, 9 + H -1=20, 8+H=20, H=12.\n\nThe sequence has actions from t=9 to t=19, which is 11 actions, but H=12 includes from turn 9 to turn 20? Turns from 9 to 20, but turn 20 is the arrival.\n\nPerhaps it's fine.\n\nBut we can confirm if there is a shorter path.\n\nSuppose we go down to y=0 at some point, but that might take more time.\n\nFor example, if at t=9, a9=D, y10=2\n\na10=D, y11=1\n\na11=D, y12=0\n\nThen at t=12, y=0, safe.\n\nThen from there, to y=9, need 9 up moves, so y21=9 at turn 21, later than 20.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo better to stay at y=1.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=11, we have y=1, and we took S to stay at y=1 for t=12.\n\nWe could take other actions, but S is fine.\n\nNow, but we have cars on y=7 and 8 at t=14,15, but in the path, we are not on y=7 or 8 at that time.\n\nAnother thing: freeway 6 has two cars, but we only considered one, but the other car never dangerous, so fine.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut in freeway 6, at t=12, it is dangerous, which we avoided.\n\nNow, but in the sequence above, when we go up from y=1, at t=13 y=2, etc., all safe.\n\nBut is there a way to be on y=7 or 8 at a safe time and go faster?\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=7 at t=16 or something.\n\nBut from t=12 y=1, min to y=7 is 6U, at turn 18.\n\nThen to y=9 at turn 20.\n\nSame as before.\n\nPerhaps we can start by going up to y=6 before t=12, but at t=12 we must not be on y=6.\n\nFor example, at t=9, go up to y=6 quickly, but then at t=12, if we are on y=6, collision, but if we can move to y=7 before t=12, but from t=9 to t=12, we have turns 9,10,11 to act, positions y10,y11,y12.\n\ny9=3, with a9 and a10, we can reach y11=5 max (a9=U,y10=4; a10=U,y11=5)\n\nThen at t=11, y=5, then a11=U, y12=6, but at turn 12 y=6 dangerous.\n\na11=S, y12=5, dangerous.\n\na11=D, y12=4, dangerous.\n\nCannot be at y=7 at t=12.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 12, with reach at turn 20.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we need to specify actions.\n\nIn the path: to be at y=1 at t=12.\n\nWe can do:\n\nt=9: a9=D, move down to y=2 at t=10? Action at turn t determines next position.\n\nAt turn 9, y=3, take a9=D, then y10 = 3-1=2\n\nTurn 10: y=2, take a10=D, y11=2-1=1\n\nTurn 11: y=1, take a11=S, y12=1 (stay)\n\nThen turn 12: y=1\n\nThen a12=U, y13=2\n\nTurn 13: y=2, a13=U, y14=3\n\nTurn 14: y=3, a14=U, y15=4\n\nTurn 15: y=4, a15=U, y16=5\n\nTurn 16: y=5, a16=U, y17=6\n\nTurn 17: y=6, a17=U, y18=7\n\nTurn 18: y=7, a18=U, y19=8\n\nTurn 19: y=8, a19=U, y20=9\n\nReached at turn 20.\n\nWe need to list actions from t=9 to t=19.\n\nt=9: action a9 = D\n\nt=10: a10 = D\n\nt=11: a11 = S\n\nt=12: a12 = U\n\nt=13: a13 = U\n\nt=14: a14 = U\n\nt=15: a15 = U\n\nt=16: a16 = U\n\nt=17: a17 = U\n\nt=18: a18 = U\n\nt=19: a19 = U\n\nIn the sequence, at t=11, we took S, but we could take other, but S is fine.\n\nWe could at t=11 take U, but then y12=2, which is dangerous at t=12, since y=2 dangerous at T=12.\n\ny=2 is freeway 2, dangerous at t=12, so we must not be on y=2 at t=12.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 is safe.\n\nIn the above, with a11=S, y12=1, safe.\n\nIf we take a11=D from y=1, y12=0, also safe, but then we need more up moves, so worse.\n\nSo S is better.\n\nNow, the actions: from t=9 to t=19, 11 actions.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be listed from turn t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nt_1=9, H=12, so turns from 9 to 9+12-1=20? Actions at turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =9 +12 -1=20.\n\nBut actions at turn 20? No.\n\nSequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo t from 0 to H-1, so a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nFor H=12, actions at t=9 to t=9+11=20? t_1 + H-1 =9 +11=20.\n\nBut turn 20 is when we reach y=9, but action at turn 20 would affect y21, which we don't need.\n\nIn the sequence, the last action is at turn t_1 + H -1, which sets position at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut we reach at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nI think I confused.\n\nStandard: at turn T, we are at position, take action a_T, go to position at turn T+1.\n\nWe start at turn t_1, position given.\n\nWe take action a_{t_1}, go to turn t_1+1 position.\n\n...\n\nTake action a_{t_1 + k}, go to turn t_1 + k +1 position.\n\nWe want at turn t_1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nThat means that at turn t_1 + H -1, we are already at (0,9), so we don't take an action at that turn to go there; we are there at the start of the turn or something.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think the position is after the action or before.\n\nFrom the game dynamics: \"player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + \\Delta y_t\" so after action at t, position updates to t+1.\n\nThen at turn t, we take action a_t, then position becomes y_{t+1} at time t+1.\n\nCollision at turn T: if at turn T, we are on y_T, and for that freeway, 0 in span.\n\nSo at turn T, position is y_T.\n\nThen we take a_T, go to y_{T+1}.\n\nWe want at some turn T, y_T =9.\n\nT = t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, at turn t_1, y_{t_1} =3, not 9.\n\nAfter actions, at turn T, y_T=9.\n\nThe actions taken are from a_{t_1} to a_{T-1}, because a_{T-1} determines y_T from y_{T-1}.\n\ny_T = y_{T-1} + \\Delta y_{T-1}, so a_{T-1} sets y_T.\n\nTo have y_T=9, we take a_{T-1} such that y_T=9.\n\nThe actions are from a_{t_1} to a_{T-1}.\n\nNumber of actions: from t_1 to T-1, that's T - t_1 actions.\n\nThen H, the number of turns, is from turn t_1 to turn T, so H = T - t_1 +1.\n\nThen T = t_1 + H -1, as given.\n\nFor example, if we reach at turn T=20, t_1=9, H=12, since 9+12-1=20.\n\nActions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -2}? Let's see.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = T =20.\n\nActions: from a_{t_1} to a_{T-1} = a_{20-1} = a_{19}\n\nSince y_T is determined by a_{T-1}.\n\nSo actions at turns from t_1 to T-1.\n\nT-1 = t_1 + H -2.\n\nFor H=12, T=20, actions at t=9 to 19, as I have.\n\nIn the sequence, {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so t=0: a_{t_1}, t=1: a_{t_1+1}, ..., t=H-1: a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nNow t_1 + H -1 = T, since T = t_1 + H -1.\n\nSo the last action is at turn T, which is a_T.\n\nBut a_T determines y_{T+1}, not y_T.\n\nContradiction.\n\nI think there is a mistake in the indexing.\n\nPerhaps the reach turn is after the actions.\n\nLet me read the task carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nFor t=0, a_{t_1}, t=1, a_{t_1+1}, ..., t=H-1, a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nThen after these actions, the position at turn t_1 + H -1 is reached? But the action at t_1 + H -1 affects the next position.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nPerhaps the actions are applied, and after H-1 actions, we are at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nStart at turn t_1, before actions.\n\nAfter first action a_{t_1}, at turn t_1+1.\n\nAfter second action a_{t_1+1}, at turn t_1+2.\n\n...\nAfter k actions, at turn t_1 + k.\n\nWe want at turn t_1 + H -1, position (0,9).\n\nThat means after (H-1) actions, we are at turn t_1 + (H-1), position (0,9).\n\nSo the actions are from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -2}, and after that, at turn t_1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nFor example, with H-1 actions, we reach turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nNumber of actions is H-1.\n\nIn the sequence, {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, that would be H actions, from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nBut after H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut we want at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nSo for turn t_1 + H -1 to be reached, we need only H-1 actions.\n\nI think there is a confusion in the problem statement.\n\nPerhaps \"turns H\" includes the starting turn.\n\nLet's assume from the context.\n\nIn the answer format, it shows \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., up to \"Turn t_1 + H -1: a_{t_1 + H -1}\"\n\nAnd after that, at turn t_1 + H, position, but we reach at t_1 + H -1.\n\nI think it's best to look at the sequence.\n\nFor our case, we reach at turn 20.\n\nWith actions from t=9 to t=19.\n\nIn the sequence, for H=12, t from 0 to 11, a_{9} to a_{20}? t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1=11, so a_{9+0} to a_{9+11} = a9 to a20.\n\nBut a20 would determine y21, but we don't need that.\n\nBut in the reach, at turn t_1 + H -1 =9+12-1=20, we want y20=9.\n\nSo action at turn 19 determines y20.\n\nSo actions should be from a9 to a19.\n\nIn the sequence for t=0 to H-1, with H=12, t=0 to 11, a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 +11} = a9 to a20.\n\nBut a20 is extra.\n\nSo for H=12, it includes a20, which is not needed.\n\nTherefore, the indexing must be that the actions are from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -2} for reaching at t_1 + H -1.\n\nBut the problem says {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}, which for t=0 to H-1, H actions, up to a_{t_1 + H -1}, but that would affect position at t_1 + H.\n\nBut we want position at t_1 + H -1.\n\nSo I think there is a mistake.\n\nPerhaps \"reach at turn t_1 + H -1\" means after the actions, but the actions include up to a_{t_1 + H -2}.\n\nI think for consistency, in this case, with our sequence, we have actions at t=9 to 19 for reaching at t=20.\n\nFor the sequence, it should be listed from turn 9 to turn 19.\n\nIn the answer, it will be fine.\n\nSo for the minimal sequence, we have the actions as above.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have to go through y=6,7,8, but at safe times.\n\nIn the path, at t=17, y=6, which is safe since dangerous only at t=12.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut is there a shorter path with H smaller?\n\nH=12, but perhaps H=11.\n\nIf H=11, reach at turn t_1 + H -1 =9+11-1=19.\n\nSo y19=9.\n\nFrom y9=3 to y19=9, net +6 with 10 actions? Positions from y10 to y19 determined by a9 to a18.\n\na9 to a18 determine y10 to y19.\n\n10 actions for net +6 from y9=3 to y19=9.\n\nNet increase +6, so sum of Δy from a9 to a18 must be +6.\n\nu - d =6, u+s+d=10.\n\nBut we also need to avoid collision at t=12.\n\nAt turn 12, y12 must not be in {2,3,4,5,6}, so y12 <=1 or >=7.\n\nBut from y9=3, with actions a9,a10,a11 (3 actions), y12 = y9 + Δy9 + Δy10 + Δy11\n\nEach Δy <=1, so y12 <=6, each Δy >= -1, so y12 >=0.\n\nBut to be >=7 impossible, so y12 <=1.\n\nBut with actions a9 to a11, if we have down, we can have y12=1 or 0.\n\nFor example, a9=D, y10=2; a10=D, y11=1; a11=S, y12=1 or a11=D, y12=0.\n\nThen y12=1 or 0.\n\nThen from there to y19=9.\n\ny12=1, y19=9, net +8 with 7 actions a12 to a18.\n\na12 to a18 determine y13 to y19.\n\n7 actions for net +8, but max increase +7, so y19 <= y12 +7 =1+7=8<9, impossible.\n\nSimilarly if y12=0, y19<=0+7=7<9.\n\nSo cannot reach y19=9 from y12 low.\n\nThus impossible for H=11.\n\nSimilarly, H=12 is minimal.\n\nNow for the sequence, we have one, but we need to output.\n\nIn the actions, at t=11 we have S, but we can have other sequences.\n\nFor example, to be at y=1 at t=12, we can have:\n\nOption 1: a9=D, a10=D, a11=S\n\nAs above.\n\na9=S, a10=D, a11=D: t9 y=3, a9=S, y10=3; t10 y=3, a10=D, y11=2; t11 y=2, a11=D, y12=1; same y12=1.\n\nBut at t=11, y=2, is it dangerous? Freeway 2 dangerous at t=12, not t=11, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn this case, at t=11, y=2, which is freeway 2, but at t=11, not dangerous, since dangerous only at t=12.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen a11=D to y12=1.\n\nBut then we have an extra down move.\n\nIn terms of number of actions, same H.\n\nBut we can choose.\n\nSimilarly, in the up part, we can have stays, but it would delay, so better not.\n\nNow, but we need to consider if at some point we can skip.\n\nAnother thing: the cars on y=7 and 8 at t=14,15, but in our path we are below.\n\nSuppose we go up faster after t=12, but we can't.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=8 at t=15, but t=15 y=8 dangerous, so we need to avoid.\n\nIn our path, at t=15 we are at y=4, safe.\n\nIf we want to be at y=8 at t=16 or something.\n\nBut from y=1 at t=12, min to y=8 at turn: after 7U, y13=2,t13; ... y19=8,t19? y12=1, a12=U,y13=2; ... after 7U, y19=8 at turn 19.\n\nThen to y=9 at turn 20.\n\nSame.\n\nSo no better.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is as above.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 6 has two cars, but we handled.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 and 8 have cars dangerous at t=14,15, but we are not there.\n\nNow, the initial position: player at (0,3) at turn 9.\n\nCars: for example, on y=3, dangerous at t=12, but we are not there at t=12.\n\nIn the sequence, when we are on y=3 at turn 14, it is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nNow, to write the actions.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nTurn 10: D\n\nTurn 11: S  (or D, but S better)\n\nThen Turn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nIn the sequence, from turn 12 to 19 all U, but turn 19 action to y20=9.\n\nIn the list, actions up to turn 19.\n\nFor H=12, turns from turn 9 to turn 20? But actions listed for turns 9 to 19.\n\nIn the box, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{  \nTurn 9: D  \nTurn 10: D  \nTurn 11: S  \nTurn 12: U  \nTurn 13: U  \nTurn 14: U  \nTurn 15: U  \nTurn 16: U  \nTurn 17: U  \nTurn 18: U  \nTurn 19: U  \n}\n\nBut we need to specify until the action that reaches.\n\nIn this, after a19=U, y20=9 at turn 20.\n\nAnd we have 11 actions, but H=12.\n\nIn the sequence, it ends with turn 19: U, which is correct.\n\nThe last turn listed is turn 19, which is t_1 + 10, but for H=12, t_1 + H -1 =20, so actions up to t=19.\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to H-1=11, a_{9} to a_{20}, but a_{20} not needed.\n\nI think for the purpose, we can output the actions from t=9 to t=19.\n\nPerhaps the H includes the turns from start to end.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n\nTo match the format, for H=12, the sequence should have 12 actions? But we have only 11.\n\nNo.\n\nLet's calculate number of actions.\n\nFrom start turn t_1=9, to reach at turn T=20, actions taken at turns 9 to 19 inclusive, 11 actions.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1} with H=12, t=0 to 11, a9 to a20, 12 actions, but a20 is not used.\n\nSo probably, the indexing is off by one.\n\nPerhaps \"turns H\" means the number of action turns, but the reach turn is after.\n\nI think for this problem, we should go with the sequence we have.\n\nPerhaps in the context, the minimal H is 12 with reach at turn 20.\n\nAnd the actions as above.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 9\\) is 12. This means the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 9 + 12 - 1 = 20\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on a dangerous freeway at the corresponding dangerous times:\n- Freeways \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\) are dangerous only at turn 12.\n- Freeways \\(y = 7, 8\\) are dangerous at turns 14 and 15.\n- Freeway \\(y = 1\\) is dangerous at turns 22 to 25, but since the player moves upward, this is not relevant.\n\nTo avoid collision at turn 12, the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) or \\(y = 1\\) at turn 12. Starting from \\(y = 3\\) at turn 9, the player moves down twice to reach \\(y = 1\\) by turn 11 and stays at turn 11 to be at \\(y = 1\\) for turn 12. From turn 12 onward, the player moves up continuously to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 20, avoiding the dangerous times for \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) at turns 14 and 15 by being at lower, safe positions.\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n- At turn 9, move down (D) to reach \\(y = 2\\) at turn 10.\n- At turn 10, move down (D) to reach \\(y = 1\\) at turn 11.\n- At turn 11, stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 1\\) for turn 12 (safe, as \\(y = 1\\) is not dangerous at turn 12).\n- At turn 12, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 2\\) at turn 13 (safe, as \\(y = 2\\) is only dangerous at turn 12).\n- At turn 13, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 3\\) at turn 14 (safe, as \\(y = 3\\) is only dangerous at turn 12).\n- At turn 14, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 4\\) at turn 15 (safe, as \\(y = 4\\) is only dangerous at turn 12).\n- At turn 15, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 5\\) at turn 16 (safe, as \\(y = 5\\) is only dangerous at turn 12).\n- At turn 16, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 6\\) at turn 17 (safe, as \\(y = 6\\) is only dangerous at turn 12).\n- At turn 17, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 7\\) at turn 18 (safe, as \\(y = 7\\) is dangerous at turns 14-15, not 18).\n- At turn 18, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 8\\) at turn 19 (safe, as \\(y = 8\\) is dangerous at turns 14-15, not 19).\n- At turn 19, move up (U) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 20.\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 20 with \\(H = 12\\) turns, and no collisions occur.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: \\text{ U} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 12, and the player is at (0,0). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nThe car update rules:\n- For a car at turn t1 with head h, tail tau, direction d, and speed s, at a future turn T (>= t1), the car's position is updated by moving left (if left-moving) or right (if right-moving) at speed s per turn.\n\nNote: The problem states that the car span for left-moving is [h, tau] and then becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\nBut note: for right-moving, it says: [tau, h] becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. However, in the input, the cars are given as (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\nLet me clarify the representation for right-moving cars:\n- The example for right-moving: initially [tau, h] (which means the head is at h and tail at tau, and since it's moving right, the head is the front). So when moving right, the entire car moves right by s*(T-t1). So the new head becomes h + s*(T-t1), and tail becomes tau + s*(T-t1). Similarly, for left-moving, the entire car moves left by s*(T-t1): head becomes h - s*(T-t1) and tail becomes tau - s*(T-t1).\n\nBut note: the collision condition is that at turn T, if the player is at y_T (which is the freeway row) and the player's x=0 is within the span of a car on that freeway at turn T, then collision.\n\nImportant: The player's movement:\n- At each turn t, the player chooses an action (U, D, S) which changes the y-coordinate for the next turn (t+1). So at turn t, the player is at y_t, and then chooses an action that determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSpecifically, the player update:\n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, where:\n    U: Delta y_t = +1 -> move up\n    D: Delta y_t = -1 -> move down\n    S: Delta y_t = 0 -> stay\n\nBut note: the grid is vertical axis from y=0 to y=9. The player must stay within [0,9]. So we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nThe collision condition: at turn T, if the player is at (0, y_T) and there is a car on freeway k = y_T (which is the row) such that 0 (the x-coordinate) is in the span of that car at turn T.\n\nHowever, note the important note: \n  \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in Span(T) but not in Span(T+1).\"\n\nThis means that at the moment of turn T, the player is on the freeway y_T. Then, after the action at turn T, the player moves to y_{T+1} (which becomes the freeway for turn T+1). So at turn T, we only care about the freeway y_T.\n\nTherefore, the plan:\n  We are at turn 12, at y=0. We want to go to y=9. We can move up, down, or stay. We must avoid being on a freeway row (from 1 to 8) at a turn when there is a car on that row at that turn that covers x=0.\n\nWe are given the state of the cars at turn t1=12.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway (1 to 8) and for each car on that freeway, the positions of the car at any future turn T (relative to turn 12: so T = 12, 13, 14, ...).\n\nLet me denote the time elapsed since turn 12 as t (so at turn 12, t=0; turn 13, t=1, etc.). Then for a car at freeway k:\n\nFor a car given as (h, tau, d, s) at turn 12 (t0=12), at a future turn T (where t = T - 12), the car's span is:\n\nIf d is 'right':\n   head_T = h + s * t\n   tail_T = tau + s * t\n   So the span is [tail_T, head_T] (since for right-moving, the tail is the leftmost and head the rightmost).\n\nBut note: the input for right-moving cars is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). However, the problem states for right-moving: initially [tau, h] meaning [tail, head]. So the representation in the table is (h, tau) for a right-moving car? Actually, the table says: \n  For freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nBut note: for a right-moving car, the head should be the rightmost, so if the car is moving right, then the head should be greater than the tail? But here, for freeway1: head=-48, tail=-59 -> so head > tail? Actually, -48 > -59, so yes. So the car spans from -59 (tail) to -48 (head) at turn 12.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 6: two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12). \n  First car: head=48, tail=37 -> so span [37,48] at turn12? But wait, the problem says for right-moving: [tau, h] -> so [37,48] is correct? Actually, the problem says the representation is (head, tail) but then describes the span as [tau, h] for right. So we have to be cautious.\n\nBut the update rule for right-moving: [tau, h] becomes [tau + s*t, h + s*t]. So the car at freeway6, first car: \n  at turn12: [37, 48]? But wait, the input says (48,37,right,12). So if the car is moving right, then the head is 48 (the front) and the tail is 37 (the back). So the span is [37,48] at turn12.\n\nSimilarly, the second car on freeway6: (0,-11,right,12) -> so head=0, tail=-11 -> span [-11,0] at turn12.\n\nBut note: the collision condition is that 0 is in the span. For the second car at turn12: the span is [-11,0]. So 0 is the head? Then 0 is included? So at turn12, if the player is on freeway6, then they collide? But we are at turn12 at y=0, so we are not on freeway6.\n\nNow, we need to simulate the future.\n\nLet me write down the car positions for each freeway at any time t (t = number of turns after turn12).\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-48, -59, right, 3)\n  t=0: tail = -59, head = -48 -> span [-59, -48]\n  t: tail_T = -59 + 3*t, head_T = -48 + 3*t\n\nFreeway 2: (48,37,right,12) -> at t0: [37,48]\n  t: [37+12*t, 48+12*t]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway2: [37+12*t, 48+12*t]\n\nFreeway 4: same: [37+12*t, 48+12*t]\n\nFreeway 5: same: [37+12*t, 48+12*t]\n\nFreeway 6: two cars:\n  car1: (48,37,right,12) -> [37+12*t, 48+12*t]\n  car2: (0,-11,right,12) -> [-11+12*t, 0+12*t] = [-11+12*t, 12*t]\n\nFreeway 7: two cars:\n  car1: (-48,-59,right,6) -> [-59+6*t, -48+6*t]\n  car2: (0,-11,right,6) -> [-11+6*t, 0+6*t] = [-11+6*t, 6*t]\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway7: \n  car1: [-59+6*t, -48+6*t]\n  car2: [-11+6*t, 6*t]\n\nWe are starting at turn12 (t=0) at y=0. We want to be at y=9 at some future turn.\n\nWe can only change row by one per turn (or stay). We must avoid being on a freeway row (1 to 8) at a turn when 0 is in any car's span on that row.\n\nNote: at the starting turn (t0=12), we are at y=0, so we are not on any freeway row (since freeways are from 1 to 8). We are safe.\n\nOur goal: reach (0,9). Note that 9 is not a freeway (freeways are 1-8), so when we are at y=9, we don't have to worry about cars.\n\nBut note: to get to y=9, we must pass through the freeways. Also, we start at y=0 and we need to go to y=9, so we must go upward (we can also go down, but that would be inefficient). So we plan to move upward as much as possible.\n\nThe minimal number of turns? The direct upward path: 9 steps (each step up). But we have to avoid collisions.\n\nWe are going to simulate the future turns and check for each freeway row at each turn if we can be there without collision.\n\nWe are at:\n  turn12 (t=0): y=0 -> safe (since y=0 is not a freeway)\n\nThen at turn13 (t=1): we choose an action at turn12 to determine y13. We can choose U (then y13=1), D (then y13=-1 -> invalid, so we cannot choose D at turn12), or S (then y13=0). So we can only choose U or S.\n\nBut we want to minimize turns, so we want to go up as fast as possible. However, we must avoid collisions.\n\nLet's check freeway1 (y=1) at t=1 (turn13):\n  car: [-59+3*1, -48+3*1] = [-56, -45] -> does 0 lie in [-56,-45]? No, because -56 <= 0 <= -45? 0 is not between -56 and -45 (since -45 is less than 0? Actually, -45 is negative and 0 is positive? Wait: -56 <= -45, and 0 is greater than -45? So 0 is not in the interval? The interval is [-56, -45] which are both negative. So 0 is not in the interval. So freeway1 at t=1 is safe.\n\nSo if we move up at turn12 (so at turn13 we are at y=1), then we are safe.\n\nThen at turn13 (t=1) we are at y=1. Then at turn14 (t=2) we can choose to go to y=2 (U), or stay at y=1 (S), or go down to y=0 (D).\n\nBut we want to go up. So we consider going to y=2 at turn14.\n\nCheck freeway2 (y=2) at t=2 (turn14):\n  car: [37+12*2, 48+12*2] = [37+24, 48+24] = [61,72] -> 0 is not in [61,72]. Safe.\n\nThen at turn14, we are at y=2. Then at turn15 (t=3) we can go to y=3.\n\nCheck freeway3 (y=3) at t=3:\n  car: [37+12*3, 48+12*3] = [37+36,48+36]=[73,84] -> 0 not in [73,84]. Safe.\n\nThen at turn15, we are at y=3. Then at turn16 (t=4) we go to y=4.\n\nFreeway4 (y=4) at t=4:\n  [37+12*4,48+12*4]=[37+48,48+48]=[85,96] -> safe.\n\nTurn16: at y=4. Then at turn17 (t=5) to y=5.\n\nFreeway5 (y=5) at t=5:\n  [37+12*5,48+12*5]=[37+60,48+60]=[97,108] -> safe.\n\nTurn17: at y=5. Then at turn18 (t=6) to y=6.\n\nFreeway6 (y=6) at t=6:\n  There are two cars:\n    car1: [37+12*6,48+12*6]=[37+72,48+72]=[109,120] -> safe (0 not in [109,120])\n    car2: [-11+12*6, 12*6]=[-11+72,72]=[61,72] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway6 at t=6 is safe.\n\nTurn18: at y=6. Then at turn19 (t=7) to y=7.\n\nFreeway7 (y=7) at t=7:\n  Two cars:\n    car1: [-59+6*7, -48+6*7] = [-59+42, -48+42] = [-17, -6] -> 0 not in [-17,-6]? (both negative) -> safe.\n    car2: [-11+6*7, 6*7] = [-11+42,42] = [31,42] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway7 is safe at t=7.\n\nTurn19: at y=7. Then at turn20 (t=8) to y=8.\n\nFreeway8 (y=8) at t=8:\n  Two cars:\n    car1: [-59+6*8, -48+6*8] = [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> note: the span is [-11,0]. So 0 is the head? Then 0 is included. So if we are at y=8 at turn20 (t=8), then we are on freeway8 and 0 is in the span of car1? -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=8 at turn20.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being at y=8 at t=8.\n\nWhat are our options?\n  We are at turn19 (t=7) at y=7. We cannot go up to y=8 at turn20 because that would cause a collision.\n\nWe can either:\n  Option1: Stay at y=7 at turn20 (so action S at turn19) -> then at turn20 we are at y=7. Then we have to check freeway7 at t=8 (turn20): \n      car1: [-59+6*8, -48+6*8] = [-11,0] -> does 0 lie in [-11,0]? Yes! So if we are at freeway7 (y=7) at turn20 (t=8), then we would collide? \n          But note: at turn19 we are at y=7, and if we choose S, then at turn20 we are still at y=7 -> so we are on freeway7 at turn20? -> collision.\n\n  Option2: Move down to y=6 at turn20 (action D at turn19). Then at turn20 we are at y=6. Then check freeway6 at t=8 (turn20):\n        car1: [37+12*8,48+12*8]=[37+96,48+96]=[133,144] -> safe.\n        car2: [-11+12*8, 12*8]=[-11+96,96]=[85,96] -> safe.\n      So freeway6 is safe at t=8.\n\nBut then we are at y=6 at turn20, which is a step back.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. So we have to eventually go up.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to wait at some rows to avoid the collision.\n\nBut note: we are at turn19 (t=7) at y=7. We have two alternatives: either stay at y=7 (but that causes collision at t=8) or go down to y=6 (then safe). So we must go down to y=6 at turn20.\n\nThen at turn20 (t=8) we are at y=6. Then at turn21 (t=9) we can choose to go up to y=7? Or wait?\n\nLet's check freeway7 at t=9 (turn21):\n  car1: [-59+6*9, -48+6*9] = [-59+54, -48+54] = [-5, 6] -> now, 0 is in the interval [-5,6]? Yes, because -5<=0<=6 -> collision.\n\nSo if we go to y=7 at turn21 (t=9), we collide.\n\nWe can choose to stay at y=6 at turn21? Then at turn21 we are at y=6, so freeway6 at t=9:\n  car1: [37+12*9,48+12*9]=[37+108,48+108]=[145,156] -> safe.\n  car2: [-11+12*9,12*9]=[-11+108,108]=[97,108] -> safe.\n\nSo we can stay at y=6 at turn21.\n\nThen at turn22 (t=10) we can go to y=7? \n  freeway7 at t=10: \n    car1: [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe for car1.\n    car2: [-11+6*10, 6*10]=[-11+60,60]=[49,60] -> safe.\n  So freeway7 at t=10 is safe.\n\nBut note: we are at turn22: we go from y=6 (at turn21) to y=7 (at turn22) by taking action U at turn21. Then at turn22 we are at y=7, and t=10 -> safe.\n\nThen at turn22 (t=10) we are at y=7. Then we can go to y=8 at turn23 (t=11).\n\nCheck freeway8 at t=11 (turn23):\n  car1: [-59+6*11, -48+6*11] = [-59+66, -48+66] = [7,18] -> safe (0 not in [7,18])\n  car2: [-11+6*11, 6*11] = [-11+66,66] = [55,66] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway8 is safe at t=11.\n\nThen at turn23 (t=11) we are at y=8. Then at turn24 (t=12) we go to y=9 -> goal.\n\nBut note: we started at turn12 (t=0) and we are at turn24 (t=12). So total turns: from turn12 to turn24 is 12 turns? Actually, we are counting the actions: we take an action at each turn from turn12 to turn23 (12 actions) to reach turn24 at y=9? \n\nBut note: at turn12 we are at y0=0. Then we take an action at turn12 to move to y1 at turn13. Then at turn13 we take an action to move to y2 at turn14, and so on until we take an action at turn23 to move to y=9 at turn24.\n\nSo we take 12 actions? But we started at turn12 and ended at turn24, so the number of actions is 12? And H is the number of turns? The problem says: minimal number of turns H and the sequence for t from 0 to H-1. So H should be the total number of steps? \n\nThe player update: we are at turn t1 (12) and we take H actions: at turns t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1, and then at turn t1+H we are at the position? \n\nBut note: the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then we have y_{t1+H-1} = 9? \n\nWait: the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nSo at the end of the sequence (after the last action) we are at turn t1+H-1 and at that turn we are at y=9.\n\nBut note: at turn t, we take action a_t and then the next state is at turn t+1. So if we take an action at turn t, then at turn t+1 we are at the new y.\n\nSo to be at y=9 at turn T, we must have taken an action at turn T-1 that led us to y=9.\n\nTherefore, we want the smallest H such that after taking H actions (starting from turn12) we are at y=9 at turn12+H.\n\nBut note: at the start (turn12) we are at y=0. Then:\n  After 0 actions: at turn12, y=0 -> not 9.\n  After 1 action: at turn13, y1 -> could be 1 (if U) -> not 9.\n  ...\n\nWe want to be at y=9 at some turn T. Then H = T - 12? Because the sequence of actions is from turn12 to turn T-1? Then the number of actions is T-12, and the turn at which we are at y=9 is T. But the problem says the minimal number of turns H and the sequence for t from 0 to H-1? So H is the number of actions? \n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence of actions for t=0 to H-1. And we require that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. \n\nSo if we take H actions, then the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and then at the next turn (t1+H) we are at a state? But the problem says at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9? \n\nWait: the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". So at the turn when we finish the last action, we are at 9? \n\nBut note: the action a_t is taken at turn t, and then the position y_{t+1} is updated. So at the moment of taking action a_t at turn t, we are still at y_t. Then the action causes y_{t+1}. So if we take an action at turn t, then at turn t+1 we are at the new position.\n\nTherefore, to be at y=9 at turn t, we must have taken an action at turn t-1 that set y_t=9.\n\nSo if we are at turn t1+H-1 and we are at y=9, that means that the action taken at turn t1+H-2 set y_{t1+H-1}=9? \n\nBut the problem says: we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. And then at turn t1+H-1 we are at y=9.\n\nThis implies that the last action (at turn t1+H-1) sets the position for turn t1+H? But we are required to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1? \n\nThere is a confusion.\n\nLet me reread the update: \n  \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\" and the action a_t is taken at turn t.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t, we choose a_t, then we move to y_{t+1} at turn t+1.\n\nTherefore, at the turn when we are at position (0,9), that is the turn after the last action? \n\nBut the problem states: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\" meaning that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nSo if we set H to be the number of actions, then we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. Then the state after the last action is at turn t1+H. But we require that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9? \n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nLooking back: \n  \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) ... such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nSo the condition is: at turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nBut note: at the starting turn t1, we are at y=0. Then we take action a_{t1} at turn t1 to determine y_{t1+1}. Then at turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1}. \n\nTherefore, if we take 0 actions (H=0), then we are at turn t1 (which is turn12) at y=0 -> not 9.\n\nIf we take 1 action (H=1): then we take a_{t1} at turn12, which sets y_{13}. Then at turn13 (which is t1+1) we are at y13. But the problem requires that at turn t1+H-1 = t1+1-1 = t1 (turn12) we are at 9? But at turn12 we are at 0. So no.\n\nIf we take H actions, then the last action is at turn t1+H-1. Then the state at turn t1+H-1 is the state that we are at after the action taken at turn t1+H-2? \n\nActually, at turn t, we are at y_t. Then we take action a_t to set y_{t+1}. So the state at turn t is set by the previous action.\n\nTherefore, to be at y=9 at turn t, we must have that the action taken at turn t-1 set y_t=9.\n\nSo if we want to be at 9 at turn T, then we take an action at turn T-1 that sets y_T=9.\n\nIn the problem, the turn at which we are at 9 is t1+H-1. So we must have an action at turn (t1+H-1)-1 = t1+H-2 that sets y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nBut the sequence of actions we provide is for t = t1 to t1+H-1. So the last action we take is at turn t1+H-1. That action sets y_{t1+H}. But we require that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9? \n\nThis implies that we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1 without taking the last action? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1, and then at the same turn (t1+H-1) we are at 9? \n\nBut that doesn't fit the update rule: because the action at turn t1+H-1 would set the state for the next turn.\n\nI think there is a misunderstanding.\n\nLet me look at the example in the problem? There is no example.\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". And we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. \n\nThe only way this makes sense is if the action at turn t does not change the state until after turn t? But the update rule says: at turn t, we take action a_t, then the next state is y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t, and we are about to take an action a_t that will set y_{t+1}. Therefore, at turn t, we are not at the new state.\n\nTherefore, to be at y=9 at turn t, we must have had the action at turn t-1 set it.\n\nThus, if we take H actions, the last action (at turn t1+H-1) will set the state for turn t1+H. But we are required to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1. That means that the action at turn t1+H-2 must have set y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nSo the sequence of actions we provide must set the state at turn t1+H-1 to 9, and we do that by the actions from t1 to t1+H-2? \n\nBut the problem says the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, meaning we provide H actions: a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}. \n\nTherefore, the action a_{t1+H-1} is taken at turn t1+H-1, and then the state at turn t1+H is set. But we don't care about that state? We only care that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nBut at turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}. How did we get there? By the action at turn t1+H-2.\n\nSo the action at turn t1+H-1 is taken when we are already at 9? That doesn't make sense because we are already at the goal.\n\nAlternatively, the goal is to be at 9 at the turn when we finish the actions? But the problem states explicitly: y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nI think the problem means that after taking the sequence of H actions (from turn t1 to t1+H-1), the player is at y=9 at the last action turn? But the update rule suggests that the state after the action at turn t is at turn t+1.\n\nTo resolve, let me assume that the sequence of actions is applied from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1, and then at turn t1+H-1, we have y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nBut this implies that the action at turn t1+H-1 is not used to move to 9? Because if we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1, then the action at turn t1+H-1 would change it? \n\nUnless we use the action 'S' at the last turn to stay at 9.\n\nBut then the action at turn t1+H-1 is taken when we are already at 9, and we choose S to stay.\n\nSo the last action might be an 'S' at the goal.\n\nBut how do we get to 9? By the action at turn t1+H-2: if we are at 8 at turn t1+H-2, then we take U to go to 9 at turn t1+H-1. Then at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9, and then we take an action? But the problem requires that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9, and then we take an action a_{t1+H-1}? \n\nThe problem says the sequence of actions includes a_{t1+H-1}. \n\nSo if we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1, then we must take an action at that turn. But we are already at the goal. We can take S to stay.\n\nSo the minimal H must include the action to get to 9 and then an action to stay? That doesn't make sense for minimal turns.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might allow that we take an action at turn t that sets y_{t+1}=9, and then we don't need to take an action at turn t+1? But the sequence is defined for t=0 to H-1.\n\nI think there is a misinterpretation.\n\nLet me re-read the problem statement: \n  \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9), ... such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nAnd the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nSo we start at turn t1: y_{t1} = 0.\nThen we take action a_{t1} at turn t1: this sets y_{t1+1} = 0 + Delta y_{t1}.\nThen at turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1}. \nThen we take action a_{t1+1} at turn t1+1: sets y_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} + Delta y_{t1+1}.\n...\nWe take the last action a_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1: this sets y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Delta y_{t1+H-1}.\n\nBut the problem requires that at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. But at turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1} (which is set by the previous action), and then we take an action a_{t1+H-1} which changes it to y_{t1+H}. \n\nSo why would we require y_{t1+H-1} to be 9? That is the state before the last action.\n\nUnless the last action is not needed to be at 9? But the requirement is to be at (0,9) at the turn of the last action? \n\nBut the collision avoidance only cares about the turns when we are on a freeway (1-8) and at the goal (9) we are safe.\n\nThe requirement is: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1..8\", and we are only on freeways when our y is in 1..8. At y=0 and y=9, we are safe.\n\nSo if we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1, then we are safe, and we don't care about the action we take at that turn (as long as we don't leave 9, but we can only go down to 8 or stay). \n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), so we must be at 9 at some turn. It doesn't require to stay there.\n\nSo if we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1, then we have reached the goal. The action we take at turn t1+H-1 might move us away, but that's after reaching.\n\nSo the condition is that at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9.\n\nTherefore, we do not require to be at 9 at the next turn. So the last action might move us away, but that's acceptable? \n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9)\". I think it means to be at (0,9) at some turn. So if at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9), then we have reached.\n\nSo we do not care about what happens after that turn.\n\nTherefore, the action a_{t1+H-1} is taken when we are at 9, and it might move us to 8 or 10 (but 10 is invalid so we wouldn't choose that), or stay at 9.\n\nBut to minimize H, we don't want to take an extra action after reaching. So ideally, the last action is the one that gets us to 9 at turn t1+H-1? But the action at turn t1+H-1 is taken and then sets y_{t1+H}. So how can we be at 9 at turn t1+H-1 by the actions we take? \n\nWe are at 9 at turn t1+H-1 because of the action taken at turn t1+H-2. Then at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9, and then we take an action a_{t1+H-1} (which is part of the sequence) that might move us away. But the requirement is already satisfied at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 (before taking the action).\n\nSo the last action is redundant for reaching the goal, but it is included in the sequence.\n\nThis is a bit odd. But let me assume that the minimal H is the number of actions we take, and at the turn when we take the last action (turn t1+H-1), we are already at 9 (because of the previous actions). So the last action is taken at the goal.\n\nThen to minimize H, we would want to be at 9 at turn t1+H-2, and then take an action at turn t1+H-1 (which would be S or U or D, but we are at 9 so U is invalid, so S or D). But then H would be larger than necessary.\n\nAlternatively, we are at 8 at turn t1+H-2, then take U at turn t1+H-2 to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1. Then at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9, and then we take an action a_{t1+H-1} (which is the last action in the sequence). But then the sequence has H actions, and we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nThis is consistent.\n\nExample: \n  H=1: \n      turn12: a12 = U -> then at turn13, y13=1. Not 9.\n  H=9: \n      actions from turn12 to turn20 (9 actions) and then at turn20 (t1+9-1 = 12+8=20) we are at 9.\n      How? \n        turn12: U -> turn13: y=1\n        turn13: U -> turn14: y=2\n        ...\n        turn19: U -> turn20: y=9.\n      So at turn20 (which is t1+8) we are at 9. But the last action is at turn19 (which is the 8th action in the sequence, index from 0 to 8? Actually, we take actions at turns12,13,...,19 (8 actions?).\n\nLet's count: \n  actions: \n      a12 (t=0) -> sets y13\n      a13 (t=1) -> sets y14\n      ...\n      a19 (t=7) -> sets y20\n  So to be at 9 at turn20, we need 8 actions? Then H would be 8, and turn20 = t1+8 = 12+8 = 20, and we require y_{t1+H-1}=y_{12+8-1}=y_{19} to be 9? But at turn19 we are at y19, and then a19 sets y20=9. So at turn19 we are not at 9.\n\nThe requirement is y_{19}=9, but in this case y19=8.\n\nSo to have y_{19}=9, we must have been at 9 at turn19. That means the action at turn18 must have set y19=9.\n\nThen the actions would be from turn12 to turn18 (7 actions) and then at turn19 (which is t1+7) we are at 9. But then the sequence of actions is for t=0 to 6? (H=7) and then at turn19 (t1+7) we are at 9.\n\nSo the last action is at turn18 (a_{18}) which sets y19=9.\n\nThen the sequence has 7 actions: turns12 to 18.\n\nAnd we are at 9 at turn19 = t1+7 = 12+7=19.\n\nSo H=7.\n\nBut then the answer format would start with \"Turn12: ...\" and end with \"Turn18: U\".\n\nAnd then at turn19 we are at 9.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of turns H is the number of actions taken, and we require that after the last action (at turn t1+H-1), the next state (at turn t1+H) is not used for the goal condition? No, the requirement is the state at turn t1+H-1 is 9.\n\nSo in the above, if we take 7 actions (H=7) then at turn12+7-1=18, we are at y18. But we require y18=9. So we must have been at 9 at turn18.\n\nSo how do we get to 9 at turn18? By the action at turn17 setting y18=9.\n\nThen the actions are from turn12 to turn17 (6 actions), and then at turn18 (t1+6) we are at 9.\n\nBut then H=6, and the last action is at turn17.\n\nAnd the state at turn18 is set by the action at turn17, but the requirement is the state at turn18 is 9.\n\nThe problem says: at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. With H=6, turn t1+H-1 = 12+6-1=17. So at turn17 we are at 9.\n\nSo the action at turn16 sets y17=9.\n\nThen actions at turn12 to turn16 (5 actions) and then at turn17 we are at 9.\n\nBut then the sequence has H=5 actions: turns12 to 16.\n\nAnd we are at 9 at turn17 = t1+5 = 12+5=17.\n\nSo to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1, we must have taken actions that make us arrive at 9 by turn t1+H-1.\n\nThe minimal H in terms of actions is the number of actions required to be at 9 at the turn of the last action? But the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, and then the state at that turn is the state we are at for the whole turn.\n\nTherefore, we must have arrived at 9 by the action at turn t1+H-2.\n\nThis is very confusing.\n\nTo simplify, let's assume that the state at turn t is the state during the turn. The action taken at turn t will change the state for turn t+1.\n\nSo to be at 9 at turn T, we need to have taken an action at turn T-1 that sets it.\n\nIn the sequence, we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nThen the state during turn t1+H-1 is the state that was set by the action at turn t1+H-2.\n\nAnd we require that state to be 9.\n\nSo we require that the action at turn t1+H-2 sets state at turn t1+H-1 to 9.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of actions is the number of actions required to get to 9 at turn t1+H-1, which is achieved by the actions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-2.\n\nThe last action (at turn t1+H-1) is taken when we are at 9, and it sets the state for turn t1+H, which we don't care about.\n\nSo the last action is not used to move to 9, but we must include it because the sequence has H actions.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is ( the number of actions required to move from 0 to 9) + 1.\n\nFor example, if we go directly up without any waiting, it takes 9 actions of U to get to 9 at turn12+9=21. \n  Action at turn12: U -> turn13:1\n  ...\n  action at turn19: U -> turn20:8\n  action at turn20: U -> turn21:9\nThen if we want to be at 9 at turn21, we require the state at turn21 to be 9, which is set by the action at turn20.\n\nBut in the sequence for H actions, if we take actions from turn12 to turn20 (9 actions), then at turn12+9-1= turn20, we are at state during turn20: which is 8. Not 9.\n\nTo be at 9 at turn20, we would need to have taken an action at turn19 that sets turn20 to 9. So we would have actions from turn12 to turn19 (8 actions) and then at turn20 (12+8-1=19? Let's calculate: turn12+8-1=19) -> we require state at turn19 to be 9. But then we must have been at 8 at turn18 and taken U at turn18 to set turn19 to 9. So actions from turn12 to turn18 (7 actions) for H=7, and then at turn12+7-1=18, we are at state during turn18: 9? Only if we got there by turn18.\n\nThis is not matching.\n\nLet me define T = the turn at which we are at 9.\n Then T >= 12.\n The number of actions taken to get to 9 is T - 12, because we take actions at turns 12,13,...,T-1 (共 T-12 actions) to set the state at turn T to 9.\n\n Then in the problem, the sequence has H actions, and we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1 = 12+H-1 = 12+H-1.\n So we set 12+H-1 = T  => H = T - 11.\n\n And the number of actions is T-12, but the problem's H is T-11.\n\n So the number of actions in the sequence is H = T-11, which is one more than the number of actions required to get to 9.\n\n Therefore, the sequence includes an extra action at the end.\n\n So in the example of direct up:\n   T = 12+9 = turn21: because at turn21 we are at 9.\n   Then H = 21 - 11 = 10.\n   The sequence has 10 actions: turns12 to turn21-1= turn20? \n        actions at turn12 to turn20 (9 actions) -> but we need 10 actions? \n\n Alternatively, if we are at 9 at turn20, then T=20, then H = 20-11=9.\n   actions at turn12 to turn12+9-1= turn20 -> 9 actions: turn12 to turn20.\n   and then at turn20 (12+9-1=20) we are at 9.\n\n So how do we get to 9 at turn20? \n   turn12: action -> turn13:1\n   turn13: action -> turn14:2\n   ...\n   turn19: action -> turn20:9\n   -> 8 actions: turn12 to turn19. But we need 9 actions? \n\n With 8 actions: turn12 to turn19, then the state at turn20 is set to 9, and the last action in the sequence is at turn19. Then turn12+8-1=19, and we require state at turn19 to be 9. \n   But at turn19 we are at 8 (because the action at turn18 set turn19 to 8), and then the action at turn19 (U) sets turn20 to 9. So at turn19, we are at 8, not 9.\n\n Therefore, to have state at turn19=9, we must have had the action at turn18 set it. Then actions from turn12 to turn18 (7 actions) would set turn19 to 9. Then at turn19 (12+7-1=18+7=19) we are at 9. So H=7, and the sequence has 7 actions: turn12 to turn18.\n\n And then the last action is at turn18 (U) which sets turn19 to 9. But the state at turn18 is set by the action at turn17, so at turn18 we are at 8. \n\n Only after the action at turn18 we are at 9 at turn19, but the state during turn18 is 8.\n\n So to have state at turn18=9, we must have been at 9 at turn17 and taken S at turn17 to stay, or something.\n\n This is very messy.\n\nGiven the time, I will assume that the intended meaning is that we must be at 9 at the turn immediately after the last action. \n  a taken at turn t:  state_{t} -> state_{t+1}\n  and we want state_{t1+H} = 9, and we take actions from turn12 to turn12+H-1 (H actions), then state_{t1+H} = 9.\n\n Then the turn at which we are at 9 is t1+H.\n\n and the number of actions is H.\n\n Then the minimal H is the minimal number of actions to from 0 to 9, which is 9 actions (UU...U).\n\n But we saw that due to the car at freeway8 at t=8, we cannot be at y=8 at turn20 (t=8) because of collision.\n\n In our earlier safe path, we had to detour.\n\n Let's calculate the safe path we had before without worrying about the goal turn.\n\n We are at turn12 (t=0) at y=0.\n turn12: U -> y=1 at turn13 (t=1)\n turn13: U -> y=2 at turn14 (t=2)\n turn14: U -> y=3 at turn15 (t=3)\n turn15: U -> y=4 at turn16 (t=4)\n turn16: U -> y=5 at turn17 (t=5)\n turn17: U -> y=6 at turn18 (t=6)\n turn18: U -> y=7 at turn19 (t=7)\n turn19: D -> y=6 at turn20 (t=8)  [because we cannot go to 8 at t=8]\n turn20: S -> y=6 at turn21 (t=9) [ or we could have gone up if safe, but at t=9, freeway7 is not safe]\n        actually, at turn20 (t=8) we are at y=6, and we can choose to go up to 7 at turn21 (t=9) -> but freeway7 at t=9 is not safe: car1: [-5,6] -> 0 in [-5,6] -> collision.\n\n So we must stay or go down.\n\n turn20: S -> at turn21 (t=9) we are at y=6.\n        freeway6 at t=9: [145,156] and [97,108] -> safe.\n turn21: S -> at turn22 (t=10) we are at y=6. \n        or can we go up? freeway7 at t=10: car1: [1,12] -> safe, car2: [49,60] -> safe.\n        so we can go up at turn21: U -> at turn22 (t=10) y=7.\n turn22: U -> at turn23 (t=11) y=8.\n        freeway8 at t=11: car1: [7,18] -> safe, car2: [55,66] -> safe.\n turn23: U -> at turn24 (t=12) y=9.\n\n So the actions:\n  turn12: U\n  turn13: U\n  turn14: U\n  turn15: U\n  turn16: U\n  turn17: U\n  turn18: U  (now at turn19 we are at y=7)\n  turn19: D  ( to avoid collision at y=8 at turn20) -> at turn20 we are at y=6.\n  turn20: S or U? but at turn20 if we do U, then at turn21 we would be at y=7, but freeway7 at t=9 ( turn21-12=9) is not safe.\n      so we must not go to y=7 at turn21.\n  turn20: S -> at turn21: y=6.\n  turn21: U -> at turn22: y=7 ( safe because t=10 for freeway7)\n  turn22: U -> at turn23: y=8 ( safe at t=11 for freeway8)\n  turn23: U -> at turn24: y=9.\n\n So actions from turn12 to turn23: 12 actions.\n\n The state at turn24 is y=9.\n\n If we assume that the sequence of actions is for turns12 to turn23 (12 actions), and we are at 9 at turn24 = t1+12.\n\n Then in the problem's requirement: we want y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n  turn t1+H-1 = 12+H-1 = 24 => H-1 = 12 => H=13.\n\n Then the sequence would be for turns12 to turn12+12 = turn24? But then the last action is at turn24, and we are at 9 at turn24? which is not set by the action at turn24.\n\n I think the intended meaning is: we take actions from turn12 to turn12+H-1, and then at the next turn ( turn12+H) we are at 9.\n\n But the problem states: y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nGiven the time, I will output the sequence of actions that gets us to 9 at turn24, and for the answer format, we only need to output the actions for turns12 to turn23.\n\n But the problem asks for the sequence of actions {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1, and we have 12 actions.\n\n So H=12.\n\n And then we require that at turn t1+H-1 = 12+12-1=23, we are at y=9? \n   At turn23, we are at y=8 ( because the action at turn23 (U) sets turn24 to 9, but at turn23 we are at 8).\n\n So to have y23=9, we would need to have gotten there earlier.\n\n or if we are at 9 at turn23, then the action at turn22 must have set it.\n\n So let's see if we can be at 9 at turn23.\n\n turn23 = 12+11 = 23, so t=11.\n to be at y=9 at turn23, we must have taken an action at turn22 that set it.\n\n at turn22, we are at y22, and we take action to set y23.\n if we are at 8 at turn22, then U at turn22 sets y23=9.\n\n So how to get to 8 at turn22.\n\n turn22 = 12+10 = 22, t=10.\n\n freeway8 at t=10: \n   car1: [-59+6*10, -48+6*10] = [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12] -> 0 in [1,12]? No.\n   car2: [-11+6*10, 6*10] = [49,60] -> safe.\n so freeway8 is safe at t=10.\n\n So if we are at 7 at turn21, then at turn21 we can take U to go to 8 at turn22.\n   and then at turn22 we take U to go to 9 at turn23.\n\n So the plan:\n  turn12: U -> turn13:1\n  turn13: U -> turn14:2\n  turn14: U -> turn15:3\n  turn15: U -> turn16:4\n  turn16: U -> turn17:5\n  turn17: U -> turn18:6\n  turn18: U -> turn19:7\n  turn19: D -> turn20:6   [because at turn20 (t=8) we cannot be at 8]\n  turn20: S -> turn21:6   [wait at 6 for one turn]\n  turn21: U -> turn22:7   [freeway7 at t=9: not safe, but t= turn21-12=9 -> car1: [-5,6] -> 0 in [-5,6] -> collision if we are at y=7 at turn21? \n        but note: at turn21, we are at y=7 only if we moved to it at turn21. \n        and the freeway7 at turn21 (t=9) must be checked.\n\n        freeway7 at t=9: \n            car1: [-59+6*9, -48+6*9] = [-59+54, -48+54] = [-5,6] -> 0 in [-5,6] -> yes, so if we are at freeway7 (y=7) at turn21, we collide.\n\n  so we cannot be at y=7 at turn21.\n\n Therefore, we must not go to 7 at turn21.\n\n then turn21: we can only choose to stay at 6 or go down to 5.\n\n turn21: S -> turn22:6.\n        freeway6 at t=10: car1: [37+12*10,48+120]=[157,168], car2: [-11+120,120]=[109,120] -> safe.\n turn22: U -> turn23:7.\n        freeway7 at t=10: car1: [1,12] (0 not in), car2: [49,60] -> safe.\n turn23: U -> turn24:8.\n        freeway8 at t=11: car1: [7,18] -> safe, car2: [55,66] -> safe.\n turn24: U -> turn25:9.\n\n Then we are at 9 at turn25.\n\n And the actions from turn12 to turn24: 13 actions.\n\n then at turn25 = 12+13-1=24? -> turn25 = 12+13 = 25, so for the condition to be at 9 at turn12+H-1=25, we would need H=14? \n   turn12+H-1=25 -> H-1=13 -> H=14.\n\n This is not efficient.\n\n We need to avoid the collision at freeway7 at t=9 and freeway8 at t=8.\n\n Alternative: at turn19 (t=7) we are at y=7.

So at the beginning of turn24, we are at 9. Then we take action S at turn24 to stay, and then at turn25 we are still at 9. \n\n So the state during turn24 is 9, and we take an action.\n\n Therefore, it meets the requirement.\n\n But is there a way to achieve it in 12 actions? \n   We would need to be at 9 at turn23 (12+12-1=23) -> so turn23=9.\n   To be at 9 at turn23, we must have taken an action at turn22 that set it.\n   So we must be at 8 at turn22 and take U at turn22.\n\n   turn22 = 12+10 = 22, t=10.\n   freeway8 at t=10: safe, as above.\n   freeway7 at t=9: unsafe for y=7 at turn21.\n\n   to be at 8 at turn22, we must have taken U at turn21 from 7 to 8.\n\n   so at turn21, we must be at 7.\n\n   to be at 7 at turn21, we must have taken action at turn20 that set it.\n   turn20 = 12+8 = 20, t=8.\n   freeway7 at t=8: car1: [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n\n   so we cannot be at 7 at turn21 if we moved to it at turn20.\n\n   unless we are already at 7 at turn20?

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0,3) at turn t_1 = 15. The goal is to reach (0,9) in the fewest turns possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are on each freeway from 1 to 8. For each car, I have its head, tail, direction, and speed at turn t_1=15. Since the cars move over time, I need to compute their positions at future turns to avoid collisions.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at that turn. The note says that if you move to a different y at turn T, you're not considered on that new y until the next turn, so you only check collision based on where you are at the start of the turn.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as T=15.\n\nPlayer position: y=3.\n\nNow, for each freeway, the car states:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, (-39, -50, right, 3). Since direction is right, head is at h, tail at tau, and it moves right, so span increases. Head should be the front, so for right-moving, head is greater than tail? Let me check the update rule.\n\nFrom the update:\n\n- Left-moving: span [h, tau] moves to [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt]\n\n- Right-moving: span [tau, h] moves to [tau + s*dt, h + s*dt]\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1: (-39, -50, right, 3). But it says (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving, head should be the right end, so in this case, head=-39, tail=-50? That seems odd because -39 > -50, so if head is -39 and tail is -50, and direction right, then as it moves right, both increase.\n\nBut in the span, for right-moving, it says [tau, h] implying tau is left, h is right? Let's read carefully.\n\n\"Right-moving: [Span(t_1) = [tau, h] → Span(T) = [tau + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nAnd in the car state, it's given as (head h, tail tau, direction, speed)\n\nFor freeway 1: head h = -39, tail tau = -50, direction right, speed 3.\n\nSince direction is right, the span at t1 is [tau, h] = [-50, -39]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h, tau] with h decreasing.\n\nIn this case, all cars seem to be right-moving except possibly others, but let's list all.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head=-39, tail=-50, dir=right, s=3 → span at t1=15: [tau, h] = [-50, -39]\n\nFreeway 2: (-36, -47, right, 12) → span [-47, -36]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? (-36, -47, right, 12) → span [-47, -36]\n\nFreeway 4: same (-36, -47, right, 12) → [-47, -36]\n\nFreeway 5: same (-36, -47, right, 12) → [-47, -36]\n\nFreeway 6: two cars: (-36, -47, right, 12) and (36, 25, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: head=-36, tail=-47, dir=right, s=12 → span [-47, -36]\n\nSecond car: head=36, tail=25, dir=right, s=12 → span [25, 36]? Since [tau, h] = [25, 36]\n\nBut tail=25, head=36, so [25,36]\n\nFreeway 7: (-30, -41, right, 6) and (18, 7, right, 6)\n\nFirst car: head=-30, tail=-41, dir=right, s=6 → span [-41, -30]\n\nSecond car: head=18, tail=7, dir=right, s=6 → span [7,18]\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7: (-30, -41, right, 6) and (18, 7, right, 6) → spans [-41,-30] and [7,18]\n\nNow, the player needs to go from y=3 to y=9, which is 6 units up, so minimum 6 turns if moving up every turn, but there might be cars blocking, so I need to avoid collisions.\n\nSince moving up is required, and cars might be at position 0 at some turns, I need to ensure that when the player is on a freeway y, at that turn, 0 is not in any car's span on that freeway.\n\nAlso, since the player moves at the same time, but collision is checked based on position at the start of the turn, I think.\n\nLet me read the collision rule:\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the player's y-position at turn T.\n\nAlso, from the note: if at turn T, you move to y_{T+1} != y_T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so for collision at T, only y_T matters.\n\nSimilarly, at turn T, you are on y_T, and if 0 is in Span(T) for a car on y_T, collision.\n\nSpan(T) is the car's span at turn T.\n\nNow, to find a sequence of actions to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nFirst, since we start at y=3, and need to go to y=9, moving up is preferred, but I might need to stay or move down to avoid cars, but moving down would increase turns, so I should minimize that.\n\nThe minimal H is at least 6, since from 3 to 9 is 6 steps up.\n\nBut it might be more if I have to wait.\n\nNow, I need to compute for each freeway, when 0 is occupied by a car.\n\nSince the cars move, I need to find for each y, when 0 is in the span of a car on that y.\n\nThen, for the player to be on that y at turn T, T must not be a time when 0 is occupied.\n\nLet me denote dt = T - t1 = T - 15.\n\nFor each freeway, find the times when 0 is in some car's span.\n\nStart with freeway 1: y=1\n\nOne car: span at T: [tau + s*dt, h + s*dt] = [-50 + 3*dt, -39 + 3*dt]\n\n0 ∈ [-50 + 3dt, -39 + 3dt] if -50 + 3dt <= 0 <= -39 + 3dt\n\nSo -50 + 3dt <= 0 and 0 <= -39 + 3dt\n\nFirst inequality: -50 + 3dt <= 0 => 3dt <= 50 => dt <= 50/3 ≈ 16.666, so dt <= 16 since integer.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -39 + 3dt => 3dt >= 39 => dt >= 13.\n\nSo for dt from 13 to 16 inclusive.\n\nThus at turns T=15+13=28 to 15+16=31, 0 is occupied on freeway 1.\n\nT = t1 + dt, t1=15.\n\ndt=13: T=28\n\ndt=14: T=29\n\ndt=15: T=30\n\ndt=16: T=31\n\nSo on freeway 1, occupied at T=28,29,30,31.\n\nBut since we start at T=15, and we need to go to y=9, probably we won't be on y=1 at late turns, but let's keep.\n\nNow freeway 2: y=2\n\nCar: (-36,-47,right,12) so span at T: [ -47 + 12*dt, -36 + 12*dt ]\n\n0 ∈ [ -47 + 12dt, -36 + 12dt ] if -47 + 12dt <= 0 <= -36 + 12dt\n\nSo -47 + 12dt <= 0 => 12dt <= 47 => dt <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916, so dt <= 3\n\nAnd 0 <= -36 + 12dt => 12dt >= 36 => dt >= 3\n\nThus dt=3\n\nSo only at dt=3, T=15+3=18\n\nOccupied at T=18.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? Car (-36,-47,right,12) so same as y=2, occupied only at T=18.\n\nBut freeway 3 is different row, but same car config, so yes, on y=3, occupied at T=18.\n\ny=3 is freeway 3.\n\nFreeway k corresponds to y=k.\n\nSo for freeway 3 (y=3): car (-36,-47,right,12) so same as above, 0 ∈ span when dt=3, T=18.\n\nBut the player is starting at y=3 at T=15.\n\nAt T=15, player is on y=3, so we need to check if 0 is occupied at T=15 for y=3.\n\nAt T=15, dt=0, span: [-47 +0, -36 +0] = [-47,-36], 0 not in [-47,-36] since -36 <0? -36 is negative, so 0 > -36, not in interval. [-47,-36] is from -47 to -36, all negative, 0 not in it.\n\nSimilarly, for dt=3, T=18, span: [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11, 0], -47 + 12*3 = -47+36= -11, -36+36=0, so [ -11, 0 ], and 0 is included, so yes occupied.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut at T=15, for y=3, not occupied.\n\nNow freeway 4: same car, (-36,-47,right,12), so occupied only at T=18.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5: same, occupied only at T=18.\n\nNow freeway 6: y=6\n\nTwo cars.\n\nFirst car: (-36,-47,right,12) → span at T: [-47 +12dt, -36 +12dt]\n\n0 ∈ this if dt=3, T=18, as before.\n\nSecond car: (36,25,right,12) → head=36, tail=25, dir=right, so span [tau, h] = [25,36] at t1.\n\nAt T: [25 +12dt, 36 +12dt]\n\n0 ∈ [25+12dt, 36+12dt]? But 25+12dt >=25 >0 for dt>=0, so 0 < 25+12dt <= left end, so 0 not in [25+12dt,36+12dt] since all positive. So this car never has 0 in span, because it starts at 25 to 36 and moves right, so always positive.\n\nThus for freeway 6, only the first car matters, occupied at T=18.\n\nNow freeway 7: y=7\n\nTwo cars: (-30,-41,right,6) and (18,7,right,6)\n\nFirst car: head=-30, tail=-41, dir=right, s=6 → span at T: [-41 +6dt, -30 +6dt]\n\n0 ∈ this if -41 +6dt <=0 <= -30 +6dt\n\nSo -41 +6dt <=0 => 6dt <=41 => dt <= 41/6 ≈6.833, dt<=6\n\nAnd 0 <= -30 +6dt => 6dt >=30 => dt>=5\n\nThus dt=5 or 6? dt>=5 and dt<=6\n\ndt=5: -41+30= -11, -30+30=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\ndt=6: -41+36= -5, -30+36=6, so [-5,6], 0 in it.\n\ndt=5: T=15+5=20\n\ndt=6: T=15+6=21\n\nSecond car: (18,7,right,6) → span [7 +6dt, 18 +6dt]\n\nAll positive for dt>=0, so 0 not in span.\n\nThus for freeway 7, occupied at T=20 and 21.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: y=8\n\nSame as freeway 7: cars (-30,-41,right,6) and (18,7,right,6), so occupied at T=20 and 21.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, when 0 is occupied (collision if player on that y at that T):\n\ny=1: occupied at T=28,29,30,31\n\ny=2: occupied at T=18\n\ny=3: occupied at T=18\n\ny=4: occupied at T=18\n\ny=5: occupied at T=18\n\ny=6: occupied at T=18\n\ny=7: occupied at T=20,21\n\ny=8: occupied at T=20,21\n\nPlayer starts at T=15, y=3.\n\nGoal: reach y=9 at some turn, with y=9 not having cars, since freeways only y=1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are the ends, no cars, so no collision there.\n\nBut we need to reach (0,9), so position (0,9), which is safe.\n\nNow, from y=3 to y=9, we need to move up through y=4,5,6,7,8.\n\nBut at T=18, all y=2,3,4,5,6 are occupied? y=2,3,4,5,6 all have collision at T=18.\n\nSpecifically:\n\ny=2: T=18 occ\n\ny=3: T=18 occ\n\ny=4: T=18 occ\n\ny=5: T=18 occ\n\ny=6: T=18 occ\n\ny=7: T=20,21 occ\n\ny=8: T=20,21 occ\n\nAt T=15, player at y=3, which is not occupied at T=15, as we saw.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal turns: if we go up every turn, from T=15 to T=20: y from 3 to 8 in 5 turns? Let's see:\n\nAt T=15: y=3\n\nAfter action at T=15, y changes for T+1.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, based on action a_t.\n\nAt turn t, action a_t determines Δy_t, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nPosition at turn t is (0, y_t).\n\nAfter action a_t, position for turn t+1 is (0, y_{t+1}).\n\nCollision at turn t depends on y_t and the car spans at t.\n\nAt turn t, player is at y_t, and if 0 in span of car on y_t at t, collision.\n\nFor turn t=15, y=3, not occupied, as above.\n\nWe need to set actions for t from t1 to t1+H-1, so turns 15 to 15+H-1, and at turn 15+H-1, y=9.\n\nLet’s denote the turn index.\n\nSet t=15,16,17,... \n\ny_t at turn t.\n\nStart: t=15, y=3\n\nAction a_t at turn t affects y_{t+1}.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t=15+H, y_{15+H} should be 9? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so actions at t=15,16,...,15+H-1.\n\nAfter action at 15+H-1, y_{15+H} is set.\n\nAnd we want y_{15+H} =9.\n\nThe position at turn 15+H is (0,9).\n\nBut collision is checked at each turn from 15 to 15+H-1, I think, since at turn 15+H, we are at (0,9), which is safe, no collision.\n\nCollision occurs during the path, not at the end if it's safe.\n\nBut at turn 15+H, if we are at y=9, no cars, so no collision.\n\nWe need to avoid collision at turns t=15 to 15+H-1.\n\nAt each of these turns, for the y_t at that turn, 0 not in car span on that y_t.\n\nNow, y_t changes based on actions.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut there are obstacles at certain times.\n\nSpecifically, at T=18, y=2,3,4,5,6 all have collision.\n\nSimilarly, at T=20,21, y=7 and 8 have collision.\n\ny=7 and 8 occupied at T=20 and 21.\n\nNow, since we start at t=15, y=3.\n\nIf we go up immediately:\n\nSuppose at t=15, action U: then y_{16} = y_{15} +1 = 4\n\nBut at t=15, we are at y=3, which is safe for t=15.\n\nAction a_t affects y_{t+1}, so at turn t, we choose a_t, which sets y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}, and check collision.\n\nFor turn t=15: position y=3, safe as above.\n\nWe choose a_{15}, which sets y_{16}.\n\nSimilarly, at t=16, we are at y_{16}, choose a_{16}, sets y_{17}, and so on.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, from y=3, we need to increase y by 6, so minimum 6 actions: U,U,U,U,U,U.\n\nThen y_{16}=4, y_{17}=5, y_{18}=6, y_{19}=7, y_{20}=8, y_{21}=9.\n\nActions at t=15 to t=20: a15 to a20, 6 actions, H=6, y_{21}=9.\n\nBut check collisions:\n\nAt t=16: y=4?

Collision.\n\nOh, so at t=18, if y=6, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if y=3,4,5 at t=18, also collision, as we saw.\n\nIn this path, at t=18, y=6, collision, not good.\n\nSo need to avoid being on y=2,3,4,5,6 at t=18.\n\nSimilarly, later at t=20 and 21, y=7 and 8 occupied.\n\nBut in the above, if I go straight to y=9, at t=19: y=7, t=20: y=8, t=21: y=9.\n\nBut at t=20: y=8, which is occupied at T=20? y=8 freeway 8, occupied at T=20 and 21.\n\nt=20, y=8, occupied, collision.\n\nSimilarly t=21, if y=9, safe, but at t=20, collision.\n\nSo both problems.\n\nNeed to adjust the path.\n\nFirst, avoid being on y=2-6 at t=18.\n\nt=18 is a bad time for those rows.\n\nSimilarly, avoid y=7 and 8 at t=20 and 21.\n\nNow, since we start at t=15, y=3, we need to be not on those rows at those times.\n\nPossible to delay or move down.\n\nBut moving down might not help and increases turns.\n\nMinimal H might be more than 6.\n\nSince at t=18, y=2-6 are all bad, we need to be either below y=2 or above y=6 at t=18.\n\ny=0 or y=1 or y=7,8,9.\n\nBut y=1: freeway 1, which has cars, but occupied only at later times, T=28-31, which is far, so at t=18, y=1 might be safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at t=18: is it occupied? Freeway 7 occupied at T=20,21, not at t=18.\n\nt=18, dt=3, for y=7: span [-41+6*3, -30+6*3] = [-41+18, -30+18] = [-23,-12], all neg, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8 at t=18: dt=3, span [-41+18, -30+18] = [-23,-12] for first car, and [7+18,18+18]=[25,36] for second, both not containing 0, so safe.\n\ny=9 always safe.\n\ny=0 safe.\n\nSo at t=18, safe rows are y=0,1,7,8,9.\n\ny=1: at t=18, dt=3, freeway 1: span [-50+3*3, -39+3*3] = [-50+9, -39+9] = [-41,-30], all neg, 0 not in, safe.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, we are at t=15, y=3.\n\nWe need to be at one of the safe y at t=18: 0,1,7,8,9.\n\nBut y=7,8,9 are above, we might not reach by t=18 from y=3.\n\nFrom t=15 to t=18, that's 3 turns: t=15,16,17 actions affect y16,y17,y18.\n\nAt t=15: y=3\n\nAfter a15, y16\n\nAfter a16, y17\n\nAfter a17, y18\n\nSo we control y16, y17, y18 with actions at t=15,16,17.\n\ny18 can be from y=3 + Δy over three actions.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0,+1, so y18 can be from 0 to 6, since y=3, min down to 0, max up to 6 in three steps? From y15=3, after three actions, y18 can be from max 3+3=6 to min 3-3=0.\n\ny15=3\n\na15: U/D/S, y16=4,2, or3\n\nThen y17: from y16, +1,0,-1\n\ny18 from y17, +1,0,-1\n\nSo y18 can be from 0 to 6 inclusive.\n\nBut at t=18, safe y are 0,1,7,8,9, but 7,8,9 are greater than 6, so impossible to be at y=7,8,9 at t=18, since max y=6.\n\nSimilarly, min y=0.\n\nSo possible safe positions at t=18 are y=0 or y=1.\n\nWe need to be at y=0 or y=1 at turn t=18.\n\nThen from there, we can go up to y=9.\n\nBut we have later constraints at t=20,21 for y=7,8.\n\nFirst, let's get to t=18 safely.\n\nSo, at t=18, we must be at y=0 or y=1.\n\nNow, from y=3 at t=15, to y=0 or y=1 at t=18.\n\nThat means we need to move down or stay to decrease y.\n\nFor example, to be at y=1 at t=18.\n\ny15=3\n\nIf we do: a15: D, y16=2\n\na16: D, y17=1\n\na17: S, y18=1\n\nOr a15: D, y16=2; a16: S, y17=2; a17: D, y18=1, etc.\n\nOr to y=0: a15: D, y16=2; a16: D, y17=1; a17: D, y18=0.\n\nBut we also need to avoid collision during the path.\n\nAt each turn, when we are on a y, it must not be occupied at that turn.\n\nFor t=15: y=3, not occupied, safe.\n\nt=16: whatever y16 is, must be safe at t=16.\n\nt=17: y17 safe at t=17.\n\nt=18: y18=0 or 1, safe.\n\nNow, what are safe at each turn.\n\nFirst, for t=16 (T=16, dt=1):\n\ny=1: freeway1, span [-50+3*1, -39+3*1] = [-47,-36], all neg, 0 not in, safe.\n\ny=2: freeway2, span [-47+12*1, -36+12*1] = [-35,-24], all neg, safe.\n\ny=3: similarly, [-35,-24] for y=3? Freeway3 same car, span [-47+12, -36+12]=[-35,-24], safe.\n\ny=4: same, [-35,-24], safe.\n\ny=5: same, [-35,-24], safe.\n\ny=6: freeway6, first car [-47+12, -36+12]=[-35,-24], second car [25+12,36+12]=[37,48], no 0, so safe.\n\ny=7: freeway7, dt=1, span [-41+6, -30+6]=[-35,-24] for first, and [7+6,18+6]=[13,24], no 0, safe.\n\ny=8: similar, safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nSo at t=16, all y are safe, since dt=1, no car has 0 in span yet.\n\nSimilarly, t=17 (dt=2):\n\ny=1: span [-50+6, -39+6] = [-44,-33], all neg, safe.\n\ny=2: [-47+24, -36+24] = [-23,-12], all neg, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=3,4,5: all [-23,-12], safe.\n\ny=6: first car [-23,-12], second [25+24,36+24]=[49,60], no 0, safe.\n\ny=7: [-41+12, -30+12]=[-29,-18], all neg, safe.\n\ny=8: similar, safe.\n\nAll safe at t=17.\n\nt=18 (dt=3): as before, y=2,3,4,5,6 occupied; y=1,7,8,9,0 safe.\n\ny=1 safe, as computed earlier.\n\nNow back to path.\n\nWe need at t=18, y=0 or y=1.\n\nSince we want to minimize time, probably better to be at higher y, so y=1 at t=18 might be better than y=0.\n\nThen from there, go up to y=9.\n\nBut we have to avoid y=7 and 8 at t=20 and 21.\n\nt=20 and 21 are later.\n\nFirst, let's get to t=18 at y=1.\n\nFor example:\n\na15: D (down), so y16 = y15 + (-1) = 3-1=2\n\nAt t=16: y=2, which is safe as above.\n\na16: D, y17 = 2-1=1\n\nt=17: y=1, safe (t=17 dt=2, y=1 safe)\n\na17: S, y18 =1\n\nt=18: y=1, safe.\n\nNow, from here, we need to go to y=9.\n\ny18=1\n\nWe can start moving up.\n\nBut at t=20 and 21, y=7 and 8 occupied.\n\nt=20: occupied y=7 and 8\n\nt=21: occupied y=7 and 8\n\nNow, let's see the timeline from t=18 onwards.\n\nt=18: y=1\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nActions: a18, a19, a20, ... setting y19, y20, y21, ...\n\nWe want y at some point to be 9.\n\nMinimal turns: from y=1 to y=9, need 8 steps up, but we can do in multiple turns.\n\ny19 = y18 + Δy18\n\ny20 = y19 + Δy19\n\netc.\n\nNow, at t=19: position y=?\n\nMust be safe.\n\nt=19, dt=19-15=4\n\nNow, which y are occupied at t=19?\n\ny=1: freeway1, span [-50+3*4, -39+3*4] = [-50+12, -39+12] = [-38,-27], all neg, safe.\n\ny=2: freeway2, [-47+12*4, -36+12*4] = [-47+48, -36+48] = [1,12], 0 not in? [1,12], 1 to 12, 0 not in since 1>0, so 0 not in span, safe? But 0 is less than left end, so not included. Only if 0 were between min and max.\n\n[1,12], min=1, max=12, both >0, so 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=3: same car, [-47+48, -36+48]=[1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\ny=4: same, [1,12], safe.\n\ny=5: same, [1,12], safe.\n\ny=6: freeway6, first car [1,12], second car [25+48,36+48]=[73,84], no 0, so safe.\n\ny=7: freeway7, dt=4, span [-41+6*4, -30+6*4] = [-41+24, -30+24] = [-17,-6], all neg, 0 not in, safe.\n\ny=8: similar, [-17,-6] for first car, [7+24,18+24]=[31,42] for second, no 0, safe.\n\nSo at t=19, all y safe.\n\nt=20 (dt=5): y=7 occupied, y=8 occupied.\n\ny=1: [-50+15, -39+15]=[-35,-24], safe\n\ny=2: [-47+60, -36+60]=[13,24], no 0, safe\n\nSimilarly y=3,4,5,6: all [13,24], no 0, safe\n\ny=7: [-41+30, -30+30]=[-11,0], 0 included, occupied\n\ny=8: similar, occupied\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nt=21 (dt=6): y=7 and 8 occupied.\n\ny=7: [-41+36, -30+36]=[-5,6], 0 in it\n\ny=8: same\n\nOthers: y=1: [-50+18,-39+18]=[-32,-21], safe\n\ny=2: [-47+72,-36+72]=[25,36], no 0, safe\n\netc.\n\nt=22 (dt=7): y=1: [-50+21,-39+21]=[-29,-18], safe\n\ny=2: [-47+84,-36+84]=[37,48], no 0\n\ny=7: [-41+42, -30+42]=[1,12], no 0, safe? [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSimilarly y=8: [ -41+42, -30+42]=[1,12] for first? Freeway8 first car: [-41+42, -30+42]=[1,12], 0 not in; second car [7+42,18+42]=[49,60], no 0, so safe at t=22.\n\nSimilarly, t=21 dt=6, y=7 and 8 occupied, but t=22 safe.\n\nNow back to our path.\n\nAt t=18, y=1\n\nWe can move up.\n\nTo avoid y=7 and 8 at t=20 and t=21.\n\nt=20 and t=21 are critical.\n\nNow, y18=1\n\nt=18: position y=1\n\na18: action, sets y19\n\na19: sets y20\n\na20: sets y21\n\na21: sets y22\n\netc.\n\nWe want to reach y=9.\n\nIf we go up fast:\n\na18: U, y19=2\n\nt=19: y=2, safe (t=19 all safe)\n\na19: U, y20=3\n\nt=20: y=3, now t=20, y=3 is safe? At t=20, y=3: freeway3, dt=5, span [ -47+60, -36+60] = [13,24], no 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=4,5,6 safe at t=20.\n\nOnly y=7 and 8 occupied.\n\nSo y=3 at t=20 safe.\n\nThen a20: U, y21=4\n\nt=21: y=4, t=21 dt=6, y=4 span [ -47+72, -36+72]=[25,36], no 0, safe.\n\na21: U, y22=5\n\nt=22: y=5, safe\n\na22: U, y23=6\n\na23: U, y24=7\n\nBut at t=24, y=7, need to check if occupied.\n\nt=24, dt=24-15=9\n\ny=7: freeway7, span [-41+6*9, -30+6*9] = [-41+54, -30+54] = [13,24], no 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, a24: U, y25=8\n\nt=25: y=8, dt=10, span [-41+60, -30+60]=[19,30], no 0, safe.\n\na25: U, y26=9\n\nThen at t=26, y=9, safe.\n\nBut this took from t=18 y=1 to t=26 y=9, that's 8 actions, plus before from t=15 to t=18, 3 actions, total 11 actions? Let's count turns.\n\nActions from t=15 to t=25? y26 at t=26.\n\nStart t=15, after H actions, y_{15+H} =9.\n\nActions at t=15 to t=15+H-1, y_{15+H}=9.\n\nIn this case: actions at t=15,16,17: to get to y18=1\n\nThen actions t=18 to t=25: 8 actions? t=18 to t=25 is 8 actions? t=18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25: that's 8 actions, y from 1 to 9, which is 8 steps? y18=1, after 8 ups: y19=2, y20=3, y21=4, y22=5, y23=6, y24=7, y25=8, y26=9. So y26=9, so actions from t=15 to t=25, that's t=15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25: 11 actions? Indices: from t=15 to t=25 inclusive is 11 turns, but actions: a15 to a25, that's 11 actions, H=11.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nSince we are at y=1 at t=18, and we can move faster or avoid the delays.\n\nBut in the above, at t=20 and t=21, we were on low y, so no problem, but it took many turns to go up.\n\nFrom y=1 to y=9, minimal 8 steps, but we might reach earlier if we were higher, but at t=18 we are at y=1.\n\nWe could be at y=0 at t=18, but that might be worse.\n\ny=1 is better.\n\nBut to reach y=9 faster, we need to start moving up earlier or something.\n\nAnother idea: at t=18, we are at y=1, but we can move up quickly to higher y before t=20 or after t=21.\n\nt=20 is soon.\n\nt=18 to t=20 is only two turns: actions at t=18 and t=19 affect y19 and y20.\n\nAt t=18: y=1\n\na18: U, y19=2\n\nt=19: y=2, safe\n\na19: U, y20=3\n\nt=20: y=3, safe as above.\n\nThen we can continue up.\n\nBut to reach y=9, we need to go to y=4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut at t=21, if we are on y=7 or 8, problem, but we can be on lower y.\n\nFor example, after t=20 y=3, we can go up.\n\na20: U, y21=4\n\nt=21: y=4, safe (t=21 y=4 safe)\n\nThen a21: U, y22=5\n\na22: U, y23=6\n\na23: U, y24=7\n\nBut at t=24, y=7, is it occupied? t=24 dt=9, as before, safe.\n\na24: U, y25=8\n\nt=25: y=8, dt=10, safe\n\na25: U, y26=9\n\nStill y26=9, actions to a25, H=11 from start? From t=15 to a25, that's 11 actions.\n\nBut we have the initial part to t=18.\n\nTotal actions: t=15,16,17 to get to y18=1, then t=18 to t=25 to get to y26=9, so actions at t=15 to t=25, 11 actions.\n\nBut we can reach earlier by being at higher y at t=18, but we can't, max y=6 at t=18, but y=6 is occupied at t=18, so not safe.\n\ny=5 at t=18 occupied, etc.\n\nSo we must be at y=0 or 1 at t=18.\n\ny=1 is better.\n\nPerhaps we can go up immediately but skip t=18 on a safe row, but all rows 2-6 are unsafe at t=18, so we must be on 0 or 1 or 7,8,9 but 7,8,9 not possible.\n\nSo must be on 0 or 1.\n\nNow, to minimize time, after t=18, we should go up as fast as possible, but we have to avoid y=7 and 8 at t=20 and 21.\n\nt=20 is only two turns after t=18.\n\nAt t=18, y=1\n\nAfter two actions: a18 and a19, we set y19 and y20.\n\ny20 can be at most y18 +2 =1+2=3, if U,U.\n\ny20=3 at t=20, which is safe, as above.\n\nThen we need to go to y=9 from y=3, which takes 6 steps, so from t=20 y=3 to y=9 at t=26, with actions at t=20 to t=25, 6 actions.\n\ny20=3, a20:U y21=4, a21:U y22=5, ..., up to a25:U y26=9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut at t=21, if y=4, safe, no issue.\n\nBut the problem is at t=20 and 21, but we are on low y, so safe.\n\nBut total from start: actions t=15,16,17 to get to y18=1 (3 actions), then t=18,19 to get to y20=3 (2 actions), then t=20 to t=25 to get to y26=9 (6 actions), total 3+2+6=11 actions.\n\nt=15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25: 11 actions, y26=9.\n\nBut we can reduce by not going down so much or something.\n\nAnother idea: at t=18, we are at y=1, but we can move up slowly or wait to avoid the y=7,8 at bad times, but since we are starting from low, it might not help.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=7 or 8 after t=21.\n\nBut from y=1, it takes time to reach y=7.\n\nFor example, at t=18 y=1, if we do multiple U, but by t=20, we can only be at y=3, as above.\n\nThen to reach y=7, from y=3, need 4 steps, so at t=24 y=7, which is after t=21, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut minimal steps to go from y=1 to y=9 is 8 actions, so at least 8 actions from t=18, so y at t=18+8=26.\n\nt=18 to t=26 for y=9, with 8 actions.\n\nBut actions at t=18 to t=25, y26=9.\n\nThen with initial 3 actions to t=18, total to t=25, 9 actions? Let's index.\n\nStart: actions at t=15,16,17 for initial part to y18=1.\n\nNumber of actions from t=18 to reach y=9: from y=1 to y=9, need 8 changes, so 8 actions: a18 to a25, y19 to y26, y26=9.\n\nSo actions: a15,a16,a17,a18,a19,a20,a21,a22,a23,a24,a25: that's 11 actions, H=11, y at t=26.\n\nBut we might reach earlier by being at higher y faster after t=18, but we can't due to the constraints.\n\nAnother thought: instead of going down to y=1, perhaps go to y=0 at t=18, but that might take same or more time.\n\nOr, at the beginning, instead of going down, we could go up to y=6 at t=17 or something, but at t=18 we need to be off.\n\nLet's see the timeline.\n\nt=15: y=3, safe\n\nWe can choose actions.\n\nSuppose we go up at first.\n\na15: U, y16=4\n\nt=16: y=4, safe\n\na16: U, y17=5\n\nt=17: y=5, safe (t=17 all safe)\n\nNow at t=17, y=5\n\na17: what to do? At t=18, we need to not be on y=2-6.\n\nSo at t=18, y must be 0,1,7,8,9 but 7,8,9 impossible from y=5 in one step.\n\ny17=5, a17 can be U, D, or S.\n\nIf U, y18=6, but y=6 occupied at t=18, collision.\n\nIf S, y18=5, occupied, collision.\n\nIf D, y18=4, occupied, collision.\n\nAll bad! Because y=4,5,6 all occupied at t=18.\n\nSo from y=5 at t=17, no matter what action, y18=4,5, or6, all unsafe at t=18.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=17 we were at y=4, a17: U to y=5, D to y=3, S to y=4, all unsafe at t=18.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 at t=17: a17 to y=2,3,4 all unsafe.\n\ny=6 at t=17: a17 to y=5,6,7? y=7 possible.\n\ny=7 at t=18 is safe.\n\nHow to get to y=7 at t=18?\n\nFrom start: y15=3\n\nTo have y18=7.\n\ny18 = y15 + net change over three actions.\n\nEach action +1,0,-1, net change from -3 to +3.\n\ny15=3, y18=7, so net +4, but max net +3 in three actions, since each +1 max, so y18 <= 6, cannot reach 7.\n\nSimilarly, min y18=0.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=7,8,9 at t=18.\n\nThus, only possible to be at y=0 or 1 at t=18.\n\nWe must go down to y=0 or 1 by t=18.\n\nNow, to minimize time, go to y=1.\n\nAs before.\n\nNow, after t=18, we can go up, but to avoid spending time on y=7 and 8 at t=20 or 21, but since we start from y=1, we won't be on y=7 or 8 until later.\n\nBut we can reach y=9 faster if we can be on higher rows earlier, but we can't.\n\nPerhaps we can move up faster after t=18, but it still takes 8 steps.\n\nUnless we can skip some rows, but no, must move one step at a time.\n\nAnother idea: after t=18, we can go up to y=6 quickly, then wait or something to avoid y=7,8 at bad times, but the bad times are t=20,21 for y=7,8.\n\nt=20 is only two turns after t=18.\n\nAt t=18 y=1, after two actions, max y=3, as before.\n\nThen at t=20, we are at low y, not on 7 or 8.\n\nThen we can continue up.\n\nThe only way to save time is to have fewer actions to reach y=9 from y=1, but it takes at least 8 actions.\n\nBut perhaps we can reach y=9 before t=26 by starting from higher, but we start from low at t=18.\n\nMaybe at the beginning, instead of going down to y=1, we go down less or something, but we have to be at 0 or 1 at t=18.\n\nFor example, if we go to y=1 at t=18, we can do it with two down actions, as I had.\n\ny15=3, a15:D, y16=2; a16:D, y17=1; then a17:S, y18=1.\n\nOr a17:D, y18=0, but y=0 might be worse.\n\nWith a17:S, we stay at y=1.\n\nNow, from y=1 at t=18, we need to go to y=9.\n\nMinimal 8 actions, but we can perhaps delay or something to avoid the y=7,8 issue, but since we are not on high y at t=20,21, no problem, but it takes time.\n\nThe constraint at t=20,21 for y=7,8 is only an issue if we are on those rows at those times, but in this case, we are not, so we can proceed directly.\n\nBut to save time, perhaps we can be at y=7 or 8 after t=21.\n\nFor example, from y=1 at t=18, if we move up continuously:\n\na18:U, y19=2\n\na19:U, y20=3\n\na20:U, y21=4\n\na21:U, y22=5\n\na22:U, y23=6\n\na23:U, y24=7\n\nNow at t=24, y=7, which is after t=21, and at t=24, y=7 is safe, as dt=9, span [13,24] no 0.\n\nThen a24:U, y25=8\n\nt=25: y=8, dt=10, span [19,30] for y=8? Freeway8 first car [-41+60, -30+60]=[19,30], no 0, safe.\n\na25:U, y26=9\n\nt=26: y=9, safe.\n\nActions from a18 to a25, 8 actions.\n\nWith a15 to a17, 3 actions, total 11.\n\nBut a15 to a25 is 11 actions, y at t=26.\n\nH is the number of turns, so H actions.\n\nThe sequence has H actions from t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nHere t_1=15, actions a15 to a25, that's 11 actions, t=15 to 25, H=11, y_{26} =9.\n\nBut we can reduce H by being more efficient.\n\nNotice that at t=19, all rows are safe, and we can be at higher y faster.\n\nFor example, from t=18 y=1, we can do multiple U, but we can only increase one per turn.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps we don't need to go all the way to y=1 at t=18; we can be at y=1 earlier or later, but we have to be safe at each turn.\n\nAt t=16 and t=17, all y are safe, so we can be at higher y at those times.\n\nBut at t=18, we need to be at y=0 or 1.\n\nSo, for example, at t=15: y=3\n\na15: U, y16=4\n\nt=16: y=4, safe\n\na16: D, y17=3  (down to 3)\n\nt=17: y=3, safe\n\na17: D, y18=2  but y=2 at t=18 is occupied! Not safe.\n\na17: S, y18=3, occupied.\n\na17: U, y18=4, occupied.\n\nNo, from y=3 at t=17, all actions lead to y18=2,3, or4, all occupied.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=3 at t=17 if we want to be safe at t=18.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=17 we are at y=2.\n\nHow to be at y=2 at t=17.\n\ny15=3, a15: D, y16=2\n\nt=16: y=2, safe\n\na16: S, y17=2\n\nt=17: y=2, safe\n\nThen a17: must go to y=0 or 1 for t=18.\n\na17: D, y18=1\n\nThen y18=1, safe.\n\na17: S, y18=2, but y=2 occupied at t=18, collision.\n\na17: U, y18=3, occupied.\n\nSo only a17: D to y18=1.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=17 y=1.\n\ny15=3, a15: D, y16=2\n\na16: D, y17=1\n\nt=17: y=1, safe\n\na17: S, y18=1 or a17: D, y18=0 or a17: U, y18=2 but y=2 occupied, so only S or D to stay at 1 or go to 0.\n\nSo essentially, to be safe at t=18, we must be at y=0 or 1, and to get there, we need to move down in the first few turns.\n\nThe fastest way is to go directly to y=1 by t=18 with two down actions and one stay or down.\n\nFor example:\n\nOption 1: a15: D, y16=2; a16: D, y17=1; a17: S, y18=1\n\nOr a17: D, y18=0\n\nBut y=1 is better for future.\n\nThen from there, go up.\n\nBut to reach y=9 faster, since from y=1, it takes 8 steps, we can't do better.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 before the car issues at later times, but the car issues at y=7,8 are at t=20,21, which are early, and we are not on high y then.\n\nBut there are no other issues, so the minimal H is 11? But let's see if we can do with less.\n\nSuppose we go to y=0 at t=18.\n\nThen from y=0 to y=9, need 9 steps, worse.\n\nSo y=1 at t=18 is better.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps at t=18 we are at y=1, but we can move up and then stay on a row to wait until after t=21 to go to y=7 and 8.\n\nBut that would take more time, not less.\n\nFor example, at some point, if we are at y=6, we can stay there until t=22 or something, but that increases turns.\n\nSo not better.\n\nMinimal H is 11.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nSequence:\n\nt=15: action D, so y16=2\n\nt=16: position y=2, safe\n\naction D, y17=1\n\nt=17: y=1, safe\n\naction S, y18=1  (we can do D to y18=0, but y=1 better)\n\nt=18: y=1, safe\n\naction U, y19=2\n\nt=19: y=2, safe\n\naction U, y20=3\n\nt=20: y=3, safe (as t=20 y=3 not occupied)\n\naction U, y21=4\n\nt=21: y=4, safe\n\naction U, y22=5\n\nt=22: y=5, safe\n\naction U, y23=6\n\nt=23: y=6, safe? t=23 dt=8, y=6: freeway6, first car span [-47+12*8, -36+12*8] = [-47+96, -36+96] = [49,60], no 0; second car [25+96,36+96]=[121,132], no 0, safe.\n\naction U, y24=7\n\nt=24: y=7, dt=9, span [-41+54, -30+54]=[13,24] for first car, no 0; second car [7+54,18+54]=[61,72], no 0, safe.\n\naction U, y25=8\n\nt=25: y=8, dt=10, span [-41+60, -30+60]=[19,30] for first; [7+60,18+60]=[67,78] for second, no 0, safe.\n\naction U, y26=9\n\nThen at t=26, y=9, reached.\n\nActions: a15=D, a16=D, a17=S, a18=U, a19=U, a20=U, a21=U, a22=U, a23=U, a24=U, a25=U\n\nThat's 11 actions.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions from t=15 to t=25, which is 11 turns.\n\nt=15 to t=25 inclusive is 11 actions.\n\nNow, can we do with less?\n\nSuppose at the beginning, we go down less.\n\nFor example, at t=15, a15:S, y16=3\n\nt=16: y=3, safe\n\na16:D, y17=2\n\nt=17: y=2, safe\n\na17:D, y18=1\n\nThen same as before, y18=1.\n\nThen same up sequence.\n\nStill 11 actions.\n\nIf we go to y=0 at t=18, then from y=0, need to go to y=9, 9 steps, so a18 to a26, y27=9, with 9 actions, plus initial 3, total 12, worse.\n\nSo y=1 is better.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=1 earlier, but at t=18 we need to be there, but we can be at y=1 at t=17 or earlier, but that doesn't help because we still need to be safe at t=18.\n\nFor example, if at t=17 we are at y=1, we can go up at t=17, but:\n\ny15=3, a15:D, y16=2; a16:D, y17=1\n\nt=17: y=1, safe\n\nNow a17: if U, y18=2, but y=2 occupied at t=18, collision.\n\nIf S, y18=1, safe.\n\nIf D, y18=0.\n\nSo cannot go up at t=17; must stay or go down to be safe at t=18.\n\nSo we lose a turn essentially.\n\nThus, minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach y=9 faster by not going down to y=1.\n\nBut we have to avoid t=18 on bad rows.\n\nAnother idea: since at t=18, y=7 and 8 are safe, but we can't reach them.\n\nOr, perhaps we can go up to y=6 at t=17, but at t=17 y=6 is safe, then at t=18, if we could jump to y=7, but we can only move one step.\n\na17:U to y=7, but y=7 at t=18 is safe, yes!\n\ny=7 at t=18 is safe.\n\nHow to get to y=7 at t=18?\n\nFrom y15=3, to y18=7.\n\nNet change +4 in three actions.\n\nBut each action max +1, so max y18=6, cannot reach 7.\n\nImpossible.\n\nSimilarly for y=8,9.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, the only possibilities are y=0 or 1 at t=18.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11.\n\nBut in the up sequence, after t=18, we used 8 actions to go from y=1 to y=9.\n\nBut at t=21, we were at y=4, which is fine, but perhaps we can be at higher y faster after t=21.\n\nFor example, at t=21, we can be at y=4, but if we had more up actions, but we start from low.\n\nSince at t=19, all safe, and t=20 only y=7,8 occupied, we can be on other rows.\n\nBut from y=1 at t=18, after three actions, at t=21 we can be at y=4, as above.\n\nThen from y=4 to y=9, 5 steps, to t=26.\n\nSame.\n\nIf we do all U from t=18: y19=2, y20=3, y21=4, etc.\n\nNo savings.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 at an earlier turn by different path.\n\nFor example, suppose we go down to y=1 at t=18, but then from t=18, we move up, and at some point, we can move faster, but no.\n\nAnother thought: the player can move down to y=0 and stay, but that takes more time.\n\nOr, since y=9 is safe, we can go directly if no cars, but there are cars.\n\nI think 11 is the minimal.\n\nBut let's check the car on freeway 6, there is a second car, but it doesn't affect.\n\nAnd for y=7 and 8, occupied only at t=20,21, which we avoid by being on lower rows.\n\nNow, in the sequence, at t=20, we are at y=3, which is fine.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=6 or something at t=20, but from y=1 at t=18, impossible.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the actions, in my sequence, I have a17:S to stay at y=1, but I could do a17:D to y=0, but worse.\n\nOr in the up part, I can go faster.\n\nBut all U is fastest.\n\nNow, to write the sequence.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn t_1 =15: a_{15} = D\n\nTurn 16: a_{16} = D\n\nTurn 17: a_{17} = S  (to stay at y=1 for t=18)\n\nThen up:\n\nTurn 18: a_{18} = U\n\nTurn 19: a_{19} = U\n\nTurn 20: a_{20} = U\n\nTurn 21: a_{21} = U\n\nTurn 22: a_{22} = U\n\nTurn 23: a_{23} = U\n\nTurn 24: a_{24} = U\n\nTurn 25: a_{25} = U\n\nAfter a25, y26=9, which is at turn 26.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=15 to t=25, 11 actions.\n\nH=11.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=15 to t=25, that's H=11 actions.\n\nAt turn t=15+H-1 =15+11-1=25, action at t=25, then y at t=26.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps we can start going up earlier.\n\nFor example, at t=17, we are at y=1, but we cannot go up because y=2 at t=18 is occupied.\n\nUnless we go up at t=17 to y=2 at t=18, but occupied.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nWe need to output the actions from turn t_1 onwards.\n\nt_1=15.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 15: D\n\nTurn 16: D\n\nTurn 17: S\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nAnd that should reach y=9 at turn 26.\n\nBut is there a way with H=10?\n\nSuppose H=10, then actions t=15 to t=24, y at t=25.\n\ny_{25} should be 9.\n\nFrom y15=3 to y25=9, net +6 in 10 actions? From t=15 to t=25, 10 intervals, but 10 actions.\n\nActions at t=15 to t=24 affect y16 to y25.\n\ny15=3, after 10 actions, y25= y15 + sum Δy.\n\nEach Δy between -1 and 1, so y25 between 3-10= -7? But y>=0, and 3+10=13>9, so possible to reach y=9.\n\nBut we have the constraint at t=18.\n\nAt t=18, we must be at y=0 or 1.\n\ny18 is after 3 actions from y15.\n\ny15=3, after a15,a16,a17, y18.\n\ny18 must be 0 or 1.\n\nThen from y18, to y25, with 7 actions: a18 to a24, 7 actions, y19 to y25.\n\ny25 should be 9.\n\nFrom y18=0 or 1, to y25=9, need at least 9 or 8 steps, but only 7 actions, so max increase 7, so if y18=1, y25 <= 1+7=8 <9, cannot reach 9.\n\nIf y18=0, y25 <=0+7=7<9.\n\nThus impossible to reach y=9 at t=25 if we must be at y=0 or 1 at t=18.\n\nTherefore, H=10 is impossible.\n\nSimilarly, H=11 is minimal.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nIn the sequence, I have a17=S, but I could have a17=D to go to y=0, but then y=0, need 9 steps to y=9, with 8 actions? From y18=0, to y25=9, 9 steps, but only 7 actions from a18 to a24, y19 to y25, max y25=0+7=7<9.\n\nNot possible.\n\nWith H=11, from y18=1, a18 to a25, 8 actions, y19 to y26, y26=9.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the sequence is fixed.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut in freeway 6, there is a second car, but we didn't use it, and in the path, we were on y=6 at t=23, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo the minimal number of turns H=11.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 15: D\n\nTurn 16: D\n\nTurn 17: S\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nIn the answer, it should be for turns starting from t_1.\n\nAlso, in the car state, for freeway 6, there is (36,25,right,12), but since it's moving right, and position positive, no issue.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nI think that's the solution.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 15\\) is 11, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Key Constraints and Path:\n- At turn \\(t = 18\\) (which corresponds to \\(\\Delta t = t - t_1 = 3\\)), freeways \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\) are occupied by cars, so the player must not be on these freeways at \\(t = 18\\). The safe freeways at \\(t = 18\\) are \\(y = 0, 1, 7, 8, 9\\), but \\(y = 7, 8, 9\\) are unreachable from \\(y = 3\\) in 3 turns (maximum reachable \\(y = 6\\)). Thus, the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) or \\(y = 1\\) at \\(t = 18\\) to avoid collision.\n- Being at \\(y = 1\\) at \\(t = 18\\) is preferable to minimize future actions, as \\(y = 0\\) would require more upward moves.\n- At turns \\(t = 20\\) and \\(t = 21\\), freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) are occupied, but the player is on lower freeways (\\(y \\leq 4\\)) at these times, avoiding collision.\n- From \\(y = 1\\) at \\(t = 18\\), it takes exactly 8 upward moves to reach \\(y = 9\\), requiring turns up to \\(t = 26\\).\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions minimizes \\(H\\) by moving down to \\(y = 1\\) by \\(t = 18\\) and then moving up directly to \\(y = 9\\):\n- **Turns 15-17**: Move down to \\(y = 1\\) at \\(t = 18\\):\n  - Turn 15: \\(D\\) (down) → \\(y_{16} = 2\\)\n  - Turn 16: \\(D\\) (down) → \\(y_{17} = 1\\)\n  - Turn 17: \\(S\\) (stay) → \\(y_{18} = 1\\) (ensures position at \\(t = 18\\) is safe on \\(y = 1\\))\n- **Turns 18-25**: Move up continuously to \\(y = 9\\):\n  - Turn 18: \\(U\\) (up) → \\(y_{19} = 2\\)\n  - Turn 19: \\(U\\) (up) → \\(y_{20} = 3\\)\n  - Turn 20: \\(U\\) (up) → \\(y_{21} = 4\\) (safe, as \\(y = 4\\) not occupied at \\(t = 20\\))\n  - Turn 21: \\(U\\) (up) → \\(y_{22} = 5\\) (safe, as \\(y = 5\\) not occupied at \\(t = 21\\))\n  - Turn 22: \\(U\\) (up) → \\(y_{23} = 6\\) (safe, as \\(y = 6\\) not occupied at \\(t = 23\\))\n  - Turn 23: \\(U\\) (up) → \\(y_{24} = 7\\) (safe, as \\(y = 7\\) not occupied at \\(t = 24\\))\n  - Turn 24: \\(U\\) (up) → \\(y_{25} = 8\\) (safe, as \\(y = 8\\) not occupied at \\(t = 25\\))\n  - Turn 25: \\(U\\) (up) → \\(y_{26} = 9\\)\n\n### Verification:\n- Collision avoidance:\n  - \\(t = 15\\): \\(y = 3\\), safe (no car at position 0).\n  - \\(t = 16\\): \\(y = 2\\), safe (no car at position 0).\n  - \\(t = 17\\): \\(y = 1\\), safe (no car at position 0).\n  - \\(t = 18\\): \\(y = 1\\), safe (no car at position 0).\n  - \\(t = 19\\): \\(y = 2\\), safe (all freeways safe at \\(t = 19\\)).\n  - \\(t = 20\\): \\(y = 3\\), safe (freeways \\(y = 2,3,4,5,6\\) not occupied at \\(t = 20\\)).\n  - \\(t = 21\\): \\(y = 4\\), safe (freeways \\(y = 2,3,4,5,6\\) not occupied at \\(t = 21\\)).\n  - \\(t = 22\\): \\(y = 5\\), safe (no car at position 0).\n  - \\(t = 23\\): \\(y = 6\\), safe (no car at position 0).\n  - \\(t = 24\\): \\(y = 7\\), safe (no car at position 0).\n  - \\(t = 25\\): \\(y = 8\\), safe (no car at position 0).\n- Position at \\(t = 26\\): \\((0, 9)\\), safe (no cars on \\(y = 9\\)).\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in \\(H = 11\\) turns, which is minimal, as \\(H = 10\\) is impossible due to the \\(t = 18\\) constraint and the need for 8 upward moves from \\(y = 1\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 15: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 21: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 22: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 23: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 24: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 25: U \\end{array} }",

However, note the note: \n   \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\"\n So at turn T, the player is only on the freeway corresponding to the starting y of that turn? Actually, let me read carefully:\n\n The collision condition: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\".\n\n And note: the player's position at the end of turn T is y_{T}. So during turn T, the player starts at y_{T-1} and ends at y_T.\n\n The note clarifies: when moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, at turn T the player is still on y_T (the starting row) and not on y_{T+1} until the next turn.\n\n Therefore, at turn T, the player is considered to be on the freeway corresponding to the starting row of that turn? \n But wait: at the beginning of turn T, the player is at y_T (from the previous turn). Then we choose an action and move to y_{T+1}. \n However, the collision condition says \"at turn T\" and \"for freeway y_T\". \n\n The problem states: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\"\n\n And note: the player is at position (0, y_T) at the beginning of turn T? Actually, the state at turn T is given by (0, y_t) at the start? \n\n But the update: at turn t, we are at (0, y_t), then we choose a_t, and then we become y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\n So during turn t, we start at (0, y_t) and end at (0, y_{t+1}).\n\n The collision condition: it says \"at turn T\", meaning during the turn? \n\n The note clarifies: when you are moving, during the turn T you are not yet on the new row. So the freeway you are on during turn T is the row you started on, i.e., y_T (which is the row at the beginning of the turn).\n\n But wait: the problem says \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\", and at the beginning of turn T the player is at y_T. \n\n However, note that the car update is given for T>t1, and the span at time T is provided. \n\n Therefore, to avoid collision at turn T, we require that if the player is on a freeway (i.e., y_T is between 1 and 8) then the car on that freeway at time T must not have its span covering 0.\n\n But note: if the player is at row 0 or 9, then there are no cars (since cars are on freeways 1 to 8). So we are safe.\n\n However, we start at row 0 at turn 18. Then we will move to row 1 at some turn? How?\n\n Steps:\n\n We are at row 0 at turn 18 (start). Then we choose an action at turn 18: \n   - If we choose U, then we move to row 1 at the end of turn 18 -> so at the beginning of turn 19 we are at row 1.\n   - But during turn 18, we started at row 0 (which is safe, because row0 is not a freeway) and ended at row1. However, during turn 18, we were only on row0? The note says: if we move to row1 at turn18, we are not considered to be on row1 during turn18. So we are only on row0 during turn18 -> safe.\n\n Then at turn19: we start at row1. Now we are on freeway1. We must check the car on freeway1 at time 19.\n\n So we need to simulate the car positions at the times when we are on a freeway.\n\n Given the car update rules:\n\n For a car at time t1 (current turn 18) with (head, tail, direction, speed), at time T (>=18) the span is:\n\n   If left-moving: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n   If right-moving: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\n Note: the initial state at turn18 is given.\n\n Also note: the freeway index k (from 1 to 8) corresponds to the row.\n\n We are given:\n\n Freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3) -> wait, direction is right? Then it should be [tau, h] and moving right? \n   But the representation: head and tail? The problem says for left-moving: span is [h, tau] and for right: [tau, h]. \n   However, the given car is: (-48, -59, right, 3). \n\n Interpretation: \n   For a right-moving car: the span at time t1=18 is [tau, h] = [-59, -48]? \n   But the problem says: \"head h, tail tau\" and then for right-moving: [tau, h] -> so tau is the leftmost? and h is the rightmost?\n\n   Actually, in the update for right-moving: \n        Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\n   So at time 18: T-t1=0 -> [tau, h] = [-59, -48]? But the table says (head=-48, tail=-59). \n\n   Therefore, the representation in the table is (head, tail, direction, speed). \n        For a right-moving car: head is the rightmost end, tail is the leftmost end? \n\n   So at time t1=18, the car on freeway1: \n        head = -48, tail = -59, direction right, speed 3.\n        So the span at time 18 is [tail, head] = [-59, -48]. \n\n   Then at time T: \n        head(T) = head + s*(T-t1) = -48 + 3*(T-18)\n        tail(T) = tail + s*(T-t1) = -59 + 3*(T-18)\n\n   Similarly, for left-moving: \n        head(T) = head - s*(T-t1)\n        tail(T) = tau - s*(T-t1)\n\n But note: the problem says for left-moving: \n        Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> so h is the leftmost? and tau the rightmost? \n        Then at time T: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n\n So the representation: \n   For any car: the two numbers given are the two ends. The direction tells us the order and how it moves.\n\n However, the problem states the initial state as (head, tail, direction, speed). \n\n   For a right-moving car: head is the right end, tail is the left end.\n   For a left-moving car: head is the left end, tail is the right end? \n\n   But in the update for left-moving: \n        initial span: [h, tau] -> meaning from h to tau, and then moves left: so h decreases and tau decreases.\n\n   In the example on freeway1: (-48, -59, right, 3) -> so head=-48 (right end) and tail=-59 (left end). \n\n   Now, we need to check if at a given time T, the car's span covers 0.\n\n   For freeway1 at time T: \n        The car's left end (tail) at T: -59 + 3*(T-18)\n        The car's right end (head) at T: -48 + 3*(T-18)\n\n        We require that 0 is in [left, right] i.e., \n            left <= 0 <= right   =>   -59+3*(T-18) <= 0 <= -48+3*(T-18)\n\n        Solve: \n            -59+3*(T-18) <= 0  -> 3*(T-18) <= 59 -> T-18 <= 59/3 ≈ 19.666 -> T <= 37.666 -> T<=37\n            -48+3*(T-18) >= 0  -> 3*(T-18) >= 48 -> T-18>=16 -> T>=34\n\n        So the car on freeway1 covers 0 at turns T=34,35,36,37.\n\n Similarly, let's list the cars that are dangerous for each freeway and for the turns we might be present.\n\n We are at turn 18 at row0. We want to go to row9. We can only change one row per turn (or stay). So the minimal number of moves without any obstacles would be 9 moves (all U). But we have to avoid the cars.\n\n We will simulate the path from row0 to row9, and we must avoid being on a freeway row k at a turn T when the car on that freeway at time T has 0 in its span.\n\n We are going to do a BFS (or Dijkstra, since each step cost 1) over the state: (turn, row). The state is the turn number and the row. We start at (18,0) and we want to reach row9 at any turn.\n\n However, note that the turn number can be large? But we are minimizing the number of turns H, so we want the minimal H.\n\n We note that the car movements are periodic? Actually, the cars move linearly and will eventually go out of the way, but we are only concerned with when they cover 0.\n\n Since we are only concerned with the times when we are on a freeway row, and we are only moving one row at a time, we can simulate for a bounded time (say from turn18 to turn18+100) and check.\n\n But note: we are minimizing H, so we want the shortest path.\n\n Steps:\n\n   We consider the state (t, y) meaning that at the beginning of turn t, we are at row y.\n   Then we choose an action a in {U, D, S}. Then at the beginning of turn t+1, we are at row y' = y + dy, where:\n        if a=U: dy=+1, if a=D: dy=-1, if a=S: dy=0.\n\n   Constraints:\n        - y' must be between 0 and 9.\n        - We must avoid collision at turn t: \n            - At turn t, we are at row y (the starting row of the turn). \n            - If y is between 1 and 8, then we are on freeway y. We must check the cars on freeway y at time t: \n                  For each car on freeway y: \n                      if it is right-moving: [tail + s*(t-t1), head + s*(t-t1)] contains 0?\n                      if left-moving: [head - s*(t-t1), tail - s*(t-t1)] contains 0?\n            - If there is at least one car on freeway y at time t that has 0 in its span, then we cannot be at that state.\n\n        Note: if we are at row0 or row9 at the beginning of turn t, then no car collision.\n\n   Also note: at the start of turn t1=18, we are at row0 -> safe.\n\n   We want to reach row9 at the beginning of some turn T (then we are done, and we don't need to do any more actions). \n        But note: the problem says \"reach (0,9)\" and then we stop. So the last action that brings us to row9 is the last one.\n\n        Actually, we are at the beginning of turn t at row y_t. Then we take an action a_t and then at the beginning of turn t+1 we are at y_{t+1}. \n        So we need to have at the beginning of turn t+H: y_{t+H} = 9.\n\n        However, we can also consider: if at the beginning of turn t we are at row9, then we are done. We don't need to take an action? \n        But the problem says: we are to provide a sequence of actions for turns t1, t1+1, ... until the turn when we first reach 9.\n\n        How is the sequence defined? The sequence is for the turns starting at t1 and ending at t1+H-1, and then at turn t1+H we are at row9.\n\n        Therefore, we start at turn t1=18 at row0. We take an action at turn18, then at turn19 we are at row1 (if we took U) ... until at turn18+H we are at row9.\n\n        So H is the number of turns we take actions. We take H actions and then we are at row9 at the beginning of turn18+H.\n\n        Therefore, we are looking for the minimal H and the sequence of actions.\n\n   Algorithm:\n\n        We do BFS (or Dijkstra) over states (t, y) where t>=18 and y in {0,1,...,9}. \n        We start at (18,0) with cost=0 (number of actions so far=0). \n        We want to find the minimal cost state (t,9).\n\n        From a state (t, y), we can choose an action a in {U, D, S} (if it doesn't take y out of bounds) to get next state (t+1, y').\n\n        Conditions for the transition (t,y) -> (t+1, y') to be valid:\n            - y' = y + dy, and 0<=y'<=9.\n            - The state (t,y) must be collision-free: \n                  if y is in {1,...,8}, then check the cars on freeway y at time t.\n\n        Note: the state (t,y) represents the beginning of turn t. The action a taken at turn t will lead to y' at the beginning of turn t+1.\n\n        But the collision condition is checked at the beginning of turn t? Actually, during turn t we are on row y (the starting row) and we are vulnerable to the car on row y at time t.\n\n        So we check the state (t,y): if y is in [1,8], then we must check the cars on freeway y at time t.\n\n        However, note: we are already at (t,y) and we are about to take an action. But the problem says collision occurs at turn T if we are on a freeway and the car covers 0 at that turn. \n        So if (t,y) is a freeway and the car on that freeway at time t has 0 in its span, then we cannot be at (t,y) in the first place? \n\n        Therefore, we must check the state (t,y) when we are about to take an action at turn t: we are at row y at the beginning of turn t, and we must avoid being there if it is a collision.\n\n        How do we get to (t,y)? We came from a previous state. So we should check the state (t,y) when we generate it? \n\n        Actually, we check the state (t,y) when we are about to expand it (i.e., when we pop it from the queue) or when we generate it? \n\n        We can check when we generate the next state: \n          - When we generate (t,y) from a parent, we check if (t,y) is safe? \n          - But note: we start at (18,0) which is safe (row0 is safe).\n\n        So in the BFS:\n\n          We start by enqueueing (18,0) with cost=0 and no action taken yet? Actually, we are going to take actions starting at turn18.\n\n          Then from (18,0), we can take actions: \n                a = U: then next state (19,1) -> then we must check state (19,1): at turn19, row1 -> freeway1 -> check car on freeway1 at time19.\n\n          We compute the car positions for freeway1 at time19.\n\n        Therefore, we need a function is_safe(t, y) that returns True if at turn t and row y we are safe.\n\n        For row0 and row9: always safe.\n        For row y in [1,8]: \n            for each car on freeway y (as given in the initial state at t1=18) with parameters (head, tail, direction, speed):\n                if direction is 'right':\n                    left_end = tail + speed*(t-18)\n                    right_end = head + speed*(t-18)\n                    if left_end <= 0 <= right_end -> collision -> unsafe.\n                if direction is 'left':\n                    left_end = head - speed*(t-18)\n                    right_end = tail - speed*(t18)   # note: for left-moving, head is the left end? and tail the right end? \n                    But wait: the representation for left-moving: the initial span is [head, tail] and then moves left: so at time t, the span is [head - s*(t-18), tail - s*(t-18)].\n\n                    However, note: the problem says for left-moving: \n                         Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> meaning from h to tau (which is left to right? because then moving left the whole interval moves left). \n                    But the head and tail: the problem says \"head h, tail tau\". \n\n                    How are they ordered? \n                      For left-moving: the car is moving left, so the head (which is the front) is the left end? \n                      Actually, the problem does not specify the order of head and tail. But from the update:\n\n                         Left-moving: [h, tau] becomes [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt]. \n\n                    So at time t, the span is [h - s*(t-18), tau - s*(t-18)]. \n\n                    Then we require that 0 is in [h - s*(t-18), tau - s*(t-18)].\n\n                    But note: the interval [A, B] for A<=B? Actually, the problem doesn't specify that h <= tau for left-moving? \n\n                    However, in the update for left-moving: the car moves left, so the entire interval moves left. The initial representation [h, tau] must be such that h is the left end and tau is the right end? \n\n                    But look at the example: no left-moving car in the given data. So we don't have to worry? \n\n                    But the given data: all cars are right-moving? \n\n        Looking at the car state:\n\n          Freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3) -> right-moving -> we computed: unsafe for t in [34,37] (inclusive) for freeway1.\n\n          Freeway 2: (48,37,right,12) -> \n                left_end = 37 + 12*(t-18)\n                right_end = 48 + 12*(t-18)\n                Check 0 in [37+12*(t-18), 48+12*(t-18)]?\n                  37+12*(t-18) <= 0 <= 48+12*(t-18)\n                  The left_end = 37+12*(t-18) is positive for t>=18 -> so 0 cannot be in the interval? -> safe.\n\n          Similarly, freeway3,4,5: same as freeway2? -> safe.\n\n          Freeway6: two cars: \n                car1: (48,37,right,12) -> same as above: safe.\n                car2: (0,-11,right,12) -> \n                    left_end = -11 + 12*(t-18)\n                    right_end = 0 + 12*(t-18) = 12*(t-18)\n                    We require: -11+12*(t-18) <= 0 <= 12*(t-18)\n                    The second inequality: 0<=12*(t-18) -> t>=18 -> always true for t>=18.\n                    First inequality: -11+12*(t-18)<=0 -> 12*(t-18)<=11 -> t-18 <= 11/12 -> t<=18.916 -> so only at t=18?\n                    But at t=18: \n                         left_end = -11, right_end = 0 -> does 0 in [-11,0]? yes, because the interval is [-11,0] and 0 is the right end.\n\n                    So at turn18, freeway6 car2: 0 is in the span -> unsafe at turn18 for freeway6.\n\n                    But note: we are at row y at the beginning of turn t.

Actually:\n\n          Freeway7: unsafe at t=26,27? \n                at t=26: car1: [-11,0] -> unsafe; car2: [-11+6*8, 0+6*8] = [37,48] -> safe. So unsafe because of car1.\n                at t=27: car1: [-59+6*9, -48+6*9] = [-5,6] -> unsafe (because 0 is in [-5,6]); car2: [43,54] -> safe. -> unsafe.\n\n          Freeway8: same? unsafe at t=26,27.\n\n        But what about row7 and row8 at other times? \n\n          Freeway7: unsafe at t=18,19,26,27 -> so at t=20 to t=25: safe? \n\n          Check freeway7 at t=20: \n                car1: -59+6*2 = -59+12 = -47, -48+12=-36 -> [-47,-36] -> safe.\n                car2: -11+6*2=1, 0+12=12 -> [1,12] -> safe.\n\n          t=21: car1: -59+18=-41, -48+18=-30 -> safe.\n                car2: -11+18=7, 12+? -> wait: car2: left_end=-11+6*(21-18)= -11+18=7, right_end=0+18=18 -> safe.\n\n          t=22: car1: -59+24=-35, -48+24=-24 -> safe.\n                car2: -11+24=13, 24 -> safe.\n\n          t=23: car1: -59+30=-29, -48+30=-18 -> safe.\n                car2: -11+30=19, 30 -> safe.\n\n          t=24: car1: -59+36=-23, -48+36=-12 -> safe.\n                car2: -11+36=25, 36 -> safe.\n\n          t=25: car1: -59+42=-17, -48+42=-6 -> safe? \n                car2: -11+42=31, 42 -> safe.\n\n          So freeway7 is safe from t=20 to t=25.\n\n          Similarly, freeway8: same as freeway7? -> safe from t=20 to t=25.\n\n        Therefore, if we can be on row7 at turn20,21,22,23,24,25 -> safe, and row8 at those turns -> safe.\n\n        How about row7 at turn19? \n          turn19: freeway7: unsafe (because of car2: at t=19: car2: left_end=-11+6= -5, right_end=6 -> 0 in [-5,6] -> unsafe).\n\n        So we cannot be on row7 at turn19? \n\n        Similarly, row8 at turn19: unsafe.\n\n        So the safe times for row7 and row8 are t in [20,25] (inclusive).\n\n        Now, we started at turn18 at row0. We want to get to row7 as early as turn18+? \n\n          Minimal turns to row7: \n            18:0 -> 19:1 -> 20:2 -> 21:3 -> 22:4 -> 23:5 -> 24:6 -> 25:7 -> so turn25 we are at row7.\n\n          But we want to be at row7 at a safe time: the safe times for row7 are [20,25]. We can be at row7 at turn25? safe.\n\n          Then we can go from row7 to row8 at turn26? but turn26: row8 is unsafe.\n\n          We need to be at row8 by turn25? That is not possible: to be at row8 at turn25, we would have to be at row7 at turn24 -> then row8 at turn25.\n\n          How to get to row7 earlier? \n\n          We started at 0 at turn18. We can use U every turn to get to row7 at turn25: \n              18:0 -> U -> 19:1 -> U -> 20:2 -> U -> 21:3 -> U -> 22:4 -> U -> 23:5 -> U -> 24:6 -> U -> 25:7.\n\n          Then at turn25: we are at row7 (safe). Then we want to go to row8: \n              turn25: row7 -> U -> turn26: row8 -> but row8 at turn26 is unsafe.\n\n          So we cannot go to row8 at turn26.\n\n        What if we wait at row7 at turn25? Then at turn25 we do S: then at turn26 we are still at row7. But row7 at turn26: unsafe (because freeway7 at turn26 is unsafe). \n\n        So we cannot be at row7 at turn26 either.\n\n        Therefore, we must leave row7 by turn25? \n\n        But the only safe time for row7 is up to turn25. So we must leave row7 at turn25? But then we go to row8 at turn26 -> unsafe.\n\n        Alternatively, we can leave row7 earlier? \n\n        How about we get to row7 at an earlier safe time? \n\n          We can be at row7 at turn24? \n            To get to row7 at turn24: we need 7 moves in 6 turns? from turn18 to turn24: 6 actions -> we can do 6 U -> then row6 at turn24? \n            Actually: \n                turn18:0 -> U(19):1 -> U(20):2 -> U(21):3 -> U(22):4 -> U(23):5 -> U(24):6 -> so row6 at turn24.\n\n          How to get to row7 at turn24? We would have to be at row6 at turn23 -> then U at turn23 to get to row7 at turn24.\n\n          But then the path:\n                turn18:0 -> U(19):1 -> U(20):2 -> U(21):3 -> U(22):4 -> U(23):5 -> U(24):6 -> but then we are at row6 at turn24.\n\n          To get to row7 at turn24, we would have to be at row6 at turn23? then at turn23 we do U -> then at turn24 we are at row7.\n\n          How to be at row6 at turn23? \n                turn18:0 -> U(19):1 -> U(20):2 -> U(21):3 -> U(22):4 -> then at turn22 we are at row4 -> then at turn22 we do U -> turn23: row5 -> then at turn23 we do U -> turn24: row6 -> not row7.\n\n          We need 7 U moves in 6 turns? impossible.\n\n        Alternatively, we can try to get to row7 at turn20? \n            turn18:0 -> U(19):1 -> U(20):2 -> then we are at row2 at turn20 -> we need to get to row7 in 0 turns? no.\n\n        So the earliest we can be at row7 is turn25.\n\n        Then what? \n\n        We must avoid row7 and row8 during turns26 and 27. \n\n        How about we wait at row6 for a few turns? \n\n          We can be at row6 at turn24 (as above) -> safe. \n          Then we can wait at row6 for two turns: \n                turn24: row6 -> S -> turn25: row6 -> safe (as computed earlier for row6 at turn25: safe)\n                turn25: row6 -> S -> turn26: row6 -> safe (row6 at turn26: safe, as above)\n\n          Then at turn26: we can go to row7? \n                turn26: row6 -> U -> turn27: row7 -> but row7 at turn27: unsafe (because freeway7 at turn27: [-5,6] covers 0).\n\n          So we cannot go to row7 at turn27.\n\n        Then we wait at row6 until turn27? then at turn27: row6 -> U -> turn28: row7 -> \n                check freeway7 at turn28: \n                    car1: -59+6*(28-18)= -59+60=1, -48+60=12 -> [1,12] -> safe? \n                    car2: -11+6*10=49, 0+60=60 -> [49,60] -> safe.\n                so row7 at turn28 is safe.\n\n          Then we can go from row7 to row8 at turn29? \n                freeway8 at turn29: \n                    car1: -59+6*(29-18)= -59+66=7, -48+66=18 -> [7,18] -> safe.\n                    car2: -11+66=55, 66 -> safe.\n                so row8 at turn29 is safe.\n\n          Then from row8 to row9 at turn30: \n                row9: safe.\n\n          So the path:\n\n            turn18: row0 -> U -> turn19: row1 (freeway1 at19: safe)\n            turn19: row1 -> U -> turn20: row2 (safe)\n            turn20: row2 -> U -> turn21: row3 (safe)\n            turn21: row3 -> U -> turn22: row4 (safe)\n            turn22: row4 -> U -> turn23: row5 (safe)\n            turn23: row5 -> U -> turn24: row6 (safe)\n            turn24: row6 -> S -> turn25: row6 (safe)\n            turn25: row6 -> S -> turn26: row6 (safe)\n            turn26: row6 -> U -> turn27: row7 (safe? at turn27: row7? wait, we are at row7 at the beginning of turn27? no)\n\n          Actually, we take an action at turn26: U -> then at turn27 we are at row7.\n\n          So at the beginning of turn27 we are at row6 -> then we take U -> then at the beginning of turn28 we are at row7? \n\n          Correction:\n\n            turn26: at the beginning: row6 -> action U -> then at the beginning of turn27: row7.\n\n          Then at turn27: we are at row7 (freeway7 at turn27: unsafe? we computed freeway7 at turn27: unsafe). \n\n          But note: the collision condition is checked at the beginning of the turn? \n\n          The state (turn27, row7) is at the beginning of turn27? No: the state we are in at the beginning of turn27 is the result of the action taken at turn26.\n\n          We must check the state (turn27, row7): \n              at the beginning of turn27, we are at row7 -> so we check freeway7 at time t=27 -> unsafe.\n\n          So we cannot be at row7 at turn27.\n\n        How about we wait one more turn at row6? \n\n          turn26: row6 -> S -> turn27: row6 (safe)\n          turn27: row6 -> U -> turn28: row7 -> then at turn28, freeway7 is safe (as above).\n\n          Then:\n            turn28: row7 -> U -> turn29: row8 (freeway8 at29: safe)\n            turn29: row8 -> U -> turn30: row9 -> done.\n\n          So total turns: from turn18 to turn30: that's 13 actions? \n                actions at turns: 18,19,...,29 -> 12 actions? \n                then at the beginning of turn30 we are at row9.\n\n          How many actions? \n                We start at turn18: we take 12 actions (turns 18 to 29) -> then at turn30 we are at row9 -> so H=12.\n\n          The sequence:\n\n            turn18: U -> row1 at19\n            turn19: U -> row2 at20\n            turn20: U -> row3 at21\n            turn21: U -> row4 at22\n            turn22: U -> row5 at23\n            turn23: U -> row6 at24\n            turn24: S -> row6 at25\n            turn25: S -> row6 at26\n            turn26: S -> row6 at27   [we did three S at row6?]\n            turn27: U -> row7 at28\n            turn28: U -> row8 at29\n            turn29: U -> row9 at30\n\n          But wait, at turn24,25,26 we did S: so three S.\n\n          However, we can see if we can avoid one of the waits.\n\n          We must avoid row7 at turn27. The earliest safe time for row7 after turn25 is turn28? \n\n          How did we get to row6 at turn24? \n            Then we can do:\n                turn24: U -> then at turn25: row7 -> but row7 at turn25: safe? yes (we computed freeway7 at turn25: safe). \n                Then at turn25: row7 -> we cannot stay at row7 at turn26 (unsafe) so we must leave. \n                We can go up to row8? at turn26: row8 unsafe -> not good.\n                Or go down to row6? at turn25: row7 -> D -> turn26: row6 -> safe (freeway6 at26: safe).\n\n                Then at turn26: row6 -> then we can go up to row7 at turn27? -> unsafe (row7 at27).\n\n                Or wait at row6 at turn26: S -> turn27: row6 -> then U at27 to row7 at28 -> safe.\n\n                Then:\n                  turn18:U,19:U,20:U,21:U,22:U,23:U -> turn24: row6? \n                         Actually: \n                            18:0->U->19:1\n                            19:1->U->20:2\n                            20:2->U->21:3\n                            21:3->U->22:4\n                            22:4->U->23:5\n                            23:5->U->24:6\n                         turn24: row6 -> U -> turn25: row7 (safe)\n                         turn25: row7 -> D -> turn26: row6 (safe)   [but going down?

\n\n        Let me try to get to row7 at turn28 without going down. \n\n          We can delay the ascent to row6? \n\n          How about we do:\n\n            turn18: U ->19:1\n            turn19: U ->20:2\n            turn20: U ->21:3\n            turn21: U ->22:4\n            turn22: U ->23:5\n            turn23: S ->23: wait, at turn23 we are at row5? then S at23: row5 at24 -> \n            turn24: U ->24: then at25: row6\n            turn25: S ->25: row6\n            turn26: S ->26: row6\n            turn27: U ->27: row7 -> unsafe? because at turn27: row7 is unsafe.\n\n          So same problem.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal path we have so far has 12 actions.\n\n        But wait, is there a path with 11 actions? \n\n          We need to reach row9 by turn29 (so 11 actions: turns18..28) -> then at turn29 we are at row9.\n\n          How? \n            We start at0, then 9 moves: but we have to avoid the unsafe states.\n\n          We can try to be at row9 at turn29: \n            We must be at row8 at turn28 -> freeway8 at turn28: \n                car1: -59+6*(28-18)= -59+60=1, -48+60=12 -> [1,12] -> safe? \n                car2: -11+60=49, 60 -> safe.\n            Then at turn28: we take U -> row9 at29.\n\n            To be at row8 at28: we must be at row7 at27 -> but freeway7 at27: unsafe.\n\n          Alternatively, be at row8 at27? \n            freeway8 at27: unsafe.\n\n          Be at row8 at26? unsafe.\n\n          Be at row8 at25? safe? \n            freeway8 at25: \n                car1: -59+6*7=-59+42=-17, -48+42=-6 -> safe? \n                car2: -11+42=31, 42 -> safe.\n            so safe.\n\n          Then if we can be at row8 at turn25, then:\n            turn25: row8 -> U -> turn26: row9 -> done in 8 actions? \n\n          How to be at row8 at turn25? \n            from row0 at18 to row8 at25: 7 moves? \n                actions: 7 U's? \n                turn18:U->19:1\n                turn19:U->20:2\n                turn20:U->21:3\n                turn21:U->22:4\n                turn22:U->23:5\n                turn23:U->24:6\n                turn24:U->25:7 -> row7 at25, not row8.\n\n            We need 8 U's? but that would be row8 at26 -> unsafe.\n\n          So we cannot be at row8 at25 with 7 moves? \n\n        Therefore, we stick to 12 actions.\n\n        But wait, we have a path with 12 actions that works. \n\n        However, we might try to reduce the waiting.\n\n        We must be at row6 until turn27? then we go to row7 at28 and row8 at29 and row9 at30.\n\n        How about we get to row6 earlier? \n\n          We are at row6 at turn24 (by doing 6 U's: 18-23). \n\n          Then we wait at row6 for three turns (24,25,26) and then at27 we go to row7, then28 to row8, then29 to row9.\n\n          But we can try to get to row6 at turn23? \n            How? \n                turn18:U->19:1\n                turn19:U->20:2\n                turn20:U->21:3\n                turn21:U->22:4\n                turn22:U->23:5 -> row5 at23? \n                then at23:U->24:6 -> then we are at row6 at24.\n\n          So same as before.\n\n        Alternatively, we can try to use a down move to avoid an unsafe row? \n\n        But that seems counterintuitive.\n\n        Given the complexity, let's code the BFS for states (t,y) for t from 18 to 30 and y from 0 to 9.\n\n        We'll use a queue, and we record the previous action to build the sequence.\n\n        Steps:\n\n          Let dist[t][y] = minimal number of actions to reach (t,y) from (18,0)\n          We initialize: dist[18][0] = 0, and then for t from 18 to ... until we find row9.\n\n          We traverse t from 18 upwards.\n\n          For each state (t,y), we try actions a in {U, D, S} that lead to (t+1, y') where y' = y + dy, and 0<=y'<=9.\n\n          But we can only go to (t+1, y') if the state (t+1, y') is safe? \n\n          But note: we are not checking (t,y) when we come in, but we should: the state (t,y) must be safe to be in.\n\n          Actually, we check when we generate (t,y): we do not generate it if it is unsafe? \n\n          However, we start at (18,0) which is safe. Then we generate (19,1) only if (19,1) is safe? \n\n          So algorithm:\n\n            Let Q = queue.\n            Q.push( (18,0) )\n            dist[18][0] = 0, and prev[18][0] = None.\n\n            while Q not empty:\n                pop (t,y)\n                if y == 9: we are done.\n\n                For each action in [U, D, S]:\n                    y_next = y + (1 if U, -1 if D, 0 if S)\n                    if y_next not in [0,9]: skip.\n\n                    t_next = t+1\n\n                    Check if the state (t, y) is safe? \n                         But note: we are at (t,y) at the beginning of turn t. We are about to take an action that will lead to (t_next,y_next).\n                         However, the safety of (t,y) should have been checked when we entered (t,y) by the previous action? \n\n                    Actually, we assume that (t,y) is safe because we only generate safe states.\n\n                    But when we generate (t,y), we check its safety? \n\n                    We should: when we are about to generate a state (t,y) (by an action from (t-1,y_prev)), we check if (t,y) is safe.\n\n                    However, in our BFS we are generating (t_next, y_next) from (t,y). We need to check the safety of (t_next, y_next) at time t_next? \n\n                    Actually, the state (t_next, y_next) will be the state at the beginning of turn t_next. We must check if at turn t_next, being at row y_next is safe.\n\n                    But note: the collision condition is at the same turn as the state: at turn t_next, we are at row y_next (if y_next is in [1,8]) and we check the cars at time t_next.\n\n                    So we should check safety of (t_next, y_next) when we generate it.\n\n                Therefore:\n\n                    for action in [U,D,S]:\n                        y_next = ... \n                        if y_next <0 or y_next>9: skip.\n                        t_next = t+1\n                        if is_safe(t_next, y_next) is False: skip.   // because at the beginning of turn t_next we are at y_next and that must be safe.\n\n                        // But note: the state (t,y) we are coming from: we assume it is safe because we are in the BFS and we only expand safe states.\n\n                    Then we set dist[t_next][y_next] = dist[t][y] + 1, and record the action.\n\n            Then we start from (18,0) and we run until we find a state (t,9).\n\n        However, note: the state (18,0) is safe. Then we generate states for t_next=19.\n\n        We must not check the safety of (18,0) again? because we are not generating it, we start with it.\n\n        Implementation of is_safe(t, y):\n\n            if y==0 or y==9: return True.\n            else:\n                for each car on freeway y (from the table) with (head, tail, d, s):\n                    if d=='right':\n                        left_end = tail + s*(t-18)\n                        right_end = head + s*(t-18)\n                        if left_end <= 0 <= right_end:\n                            return False\n                    else: # left, but we don't have any in this problem\n                        left_end = head - s*(t-18)\n                        right_end = tail - s*(t-18)\n                        if left_end <= 0 <= right_end:\n                            return False\n                return True\n\n        We run BFS until we find a state with y==9.\n\n        Given the unsafe times we identified, we hope to find a path.\n\n        We'll run from t=18 to t=40 (say).\n\n        But note: the unsafe times we listed for freeway7 and freeway8: safe after turn27? \n            freeway7 at t=28: safe, t=29: safe, etc.\n\n        We know that the minimal path we found manually has 12 actions. We hope the BFS finds that or better.\n\n        Let's run the BFS manually for a few steps:\n\n          t=18: (18,0) -> safe.\n          From (18,0): \n             U: (19,1) -> check freeway1 at19: \n                  car: left=-59+3*(19-18)=-56, right=-48+3=-45 -> 0 not in [-56,-45] -> safe -> so we add (19,1)\n             D: (19,-1) -> invalid.\n             S: (19,0) -> safe (row0) -> add.\n\n          t=19: \n             state (19,0): \n                 U: (20,1) -> freeway1 at20: left=-59+3*2=-53, right=-48+6=-42 -> safe -> add (20,1)\n                 D: (20,-1) invalid.\n                 S: (20,0) safe -> add.\n             state (19,1):\n                 U: (20,2) -> freeway2 at20: \n                      car: (48,37,right,12): left=37+12*2=37+24=61, right=48+24=72 -> safe -> add (20,2)\n                 D: (20,0) -> safe -> add (but we already have (20,0) from above, but we can have multiple ways)\n                 S: (20,1) -> freeway1 at20: safe? -> we just computed: safe -> add.\n\n          We are not going to do the entire BFS by hand, but we trust that we can get to row6 by turn24.\n\n          Then at (24,6): \n             U: (25,7) -> freeway7 at25: \n                  car1: (-48,-59,right,6): left=-59+6*7=-59+42=-17, right=-48+42=-6 -> safe.\n                  car2: (0,-11,right,6): left=-11+42=31, right=0+42=42 -> safe.\n                 so safe -> add (25,7)\n             D: (25,5) -> freeway5 at25: safe (freeway5: only car (48,37,right,12) -> at25: 37+12*7=37+84=121, 48+84=132 -> safe) -> add.\n             S: (25,6) -> freeway6 at25: \n                  car1: (48,37,right,12): 37+12*7=121, 48+84=132 -> safe.\n                  car2: (0,-11,right,12): -11+84=73, 0+84=84 -> safe.\n                 safe -> add.\n\n          Then at (25,7): \n             U: (26,8) -> freeway8 at26: unsafe (as computed) -> skip.\n             D: (26,6) -> freeway6 at26: \n                  car1:37+12*8=37+96=133, 48+96=144 -> safe.\n                  car2: -11+96=85, 0+96=96 -> safe.\n                 -> safe -> add (26,6)\n             S: (26,7) -> freeway7 at26: unsafe -> skip.\n\n          Then at (25,6): \n             ... etc.\n\n          We then continue until we find (30,9).\n\n        But we already know a path: \n            (18,0) -> U-> (19,1)\n            (19,1) -> U-> (20,2)\n            (20,2) -> U-> (21,3)\n            (21,3) -> U-> (22,4)\n            (22,4) -> U-> (23,5)\n            (23,5) -> U-> (24,6)\n            (24,6) -> S-> (25,6)\n            (25,6) -> S-> (26,6)\n            (26,6) -> S-> (27,6)\n            (27,6) -> U-> (28,7)\n            (28,7) -> U-> (29,8)\n            (29,8) -> U-> (30,9)\n\n        This is 12 actions.\n\n        However, we might find a shorter path? \n\n        How about we try to get to row9 in fewer than 12 actions? \n\n          We need to be at row9 by the beginning of turn18+H. The minimal H is 9, but we saw that fails.\n\n          We might try to be at row7 at a safe time earlier than turn28? \n\n          We can try to be at row7 at turn25: then we go to row8 at26? but unsafe.\n\n          Or we go to row8 at turn25: we can only be at row8 at25 if we take 7 U's in 7 turns? but then we are at row7 at24, then U at24 to row8 at25.\n\n          How to be at row7 at24? \n            We need 6 U's: \n                turn18:0->U->19:1->U->20:2->U->21:3->U->22:4->U->23:5->U->24:6 -> not 7.\n\n          So we need 7 U's to be at row7 at24: \n                turn18:0->U->19:1->U->20:2->U->21:3->U->22:4->U->23:5->U->24:6->U->25:7 -> then at25: row7.\n\n          Then at25: row7 -> then we can go to row8 at26? unsafe.\n\n          Or at25: row7 -> wait? S at25: then at26: row7 -> unsafe.\n\n          Or at25: row7 -> D at25: then at26: row6 -> safe.\n\n          Then at26: row6 -> then we can go up: \n                at26: row6 -> U->27: row7 -> unsafe.\n                at26: row6 -> S->27: row6 -> then U->28: row7 (safe) -> then U->29: row8 (safe) -> U->30: row9.\n\n          That's 12 actions as well.\n\n        Therefore, we output the 12-action path.\n\n        But note: in the path we have three consecutive S at row6 (turns24,25,26) and then at turn27 we do S again? \n\n        In the manual path above we did three S at row6: at turns24,25,26: \n            turn24: we are at row6 at the beginning, then we do S -> then at turn25 we are at row6.\n            turn25: at row6, then S -> turn26: row6.\n            turn26: at row6, then S -> turn27: row6.\n\n        Then turn27: row6 -> U -> turn28: row7.\n\n        But in the BFS we might have found a path that uses a down move to avoid waiting? \n\n        However, the goal is to minimize the number of actions, and 12 is the best we have.\n\n        So the sequence of actions for turns 18 to 29 (12 actions) is:\n\n          turn18: U\n          turn19: U\n          turn20: U\n          turn21: U\n          turn22: U\n          turn23: U\n          turn24: S\n          turn25: S\n          turn26: S\n          turn27: U\n          turn28: U\n          turn29: U\n\n        Then at the beginning of turn30, we are at row9.\n\n        We must check the safety of every state we are in at the beginning of the turn:\n\n          turn18: (18,0) -> safe.\n          turn19: (19,1) -> freeway1: safe.\n          turn20: (20,2) -> freeway2: safe.\n          turn21: (21,3) -> freeway3: safe.\n          turn22: (22,4) -> freeway4: safe.\n          turn23: (23,5) -> freeway5: safe.\n          turn24: (24,6) -> freeway6: safe (as computed)\n          turn25: (25,6) -> freeway6: safe.\n          turn26: (26,6) -> freeway6: safe.\n          turn27: (27,6) -> freeway6: \n                car1:48+12*(27-18)=48+108=156, 37+108=145 -> [145,156] -> safe.\n                car2:0+12*9=108, -11+108=97 -> [97,108] -> safe.\n          turn28: (28,7) -> freeway7: \n                car1: -59+6*(28-18)= -59+60=1, -48+60=12 -> [1,12] -> safe.\n                car2: -11+60=49, 0+60=60 -> safe.\n          turn29: (29,8) -> freeway8: \n                car1: -59+6*(29-18)= -59+66=7, -48+66=18 -> [7,18] -> safe.\n                car2: -11+66=55, 66 -> safe.\n\n        And turn30: row9 -> safe.\n\n        Therefore, it works.\n\n        But can we do it in 11 actions? \n\n          If we can be at row9 at turn29, then we take 11 actions (turns18 to 28).\n\n          To be at row9 at turn29, we must be at row8 at turn28.\n\n          How to be at row8 at28? \n            We must be at row7 at27 -> but freeway7 at27: unsafe.\n\n          Or at row8 at27? -> freeway8 at27: unsafe.\n\n          Or at row8 at26? -> unsafe.\n\n          Or at row8 at25? -> safe, but then we can go to row9 at26? \n              turn25: row8 -> U -> turn26: row9 -> then we are at row9 at26? \n              But then we would have taken 8 actions: \n                  turns18..25: 8 actions -> then at turn26 we are at row9? \n              How to be at row8 at25? \n                  We need 7 U's: \n                     18:U,19:1; 19:U,20:2; ... 24:U,25:7 -> row7 at25, not row8.\n\n                  We need 8 U's: then we would be at row8 at26, but turn26: row8 is unsafe.\n\n          Therefore, 11 actions is not possible.\n\n        So minimal H=12.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is:\n\n          Turn 18: U\n          Turn 19: U\n          Turn 20: U\n          Turn 21: U\n          Turn 22: U\n          Turn 23: U\n          Turn 24: S\n          Turn 25: S\n          Turn 26: S\n          Turn 27: U\n          Turn 28: U\n          Turn 29: U\n\n        We output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: S\nTurn 25: S\nTurn 26: S\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\n}\n\n        Note: The last action is at turn29, and at the beginning of turn30 we are at row9.\n\n        This matches: H=12.\n\n        However, let me recount the actions:\n\n          Actions at turn18 to turn29: 12 actions.\n\n        And the y at turn30 is 9.\n\n        We are done.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from (0, 0) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined to be optimal, requiring 12 turns. The actions are chosen to navigate around unsafe times on certain freeways, particularly avoiding freeways 7 and 8 during turns 26 and 27, and freeway 6 during turn 18, by waiting at safe positions when necessary.\n\nThe sequence of actions starting from turn \\(t_1 = 18\\) is as follows:\n\n- **Turn 18**: Move up (U) to position (0, 1) at turn 19. Freeway 1 at turn 19 is safe (car span: [-56, -45], 0 not in interval).\n- **Turn 19**: Move up (U) to position (0, 2) at turn 20. Freeway 2 at turn 20 is safe (car span: [61, 72], 0 not in interval).\n- **Turn 20**: Move up (U) to position (0, 3) at turn 21. Freeway 3 at turn 21 is safe (similar to freeway 2).\n- **Turn 21**: Move up (U) to position (0, 4) at turn 22. Freeway 4 at turn 22 is safe (similar to freeway 2).\n- **Turn 22**: Move up (U) to position (0, 5) at turn 23. Freeway 5 at turn 23 is safe (similar to freeway 2).\n- **Turn 23**: Move up (U) to position (0, 6) at turn 24. Freeway 6 at turn 24 is safe (car1: [133, 144], car2: [73, 84], 0 not in intervals).\n- **Turn 24**: Stay (S) to remain at (0, 6) at turn 25. Freeway 6 at turn 25 is safe (car1: [145, 156], car2: [85, 96], 0 not in intervals).\n- **Turn 25**: Stay (S) to remain at (0, 6) at turn 26. Freeway 6 at turn 26 is safe (car1: [157, 168], car2: [97, 108], 0 not in intervals).\n- **Turn 26**: Stay (S) to remain at (0, 6) at turn 27. Freeway 6 at turn 27 is safe (car1: [169, 180], car2: [109, 120], 0 not in intervals).\n- **Turn 27**: Move up (U) to position (0, 7) at turn 28. Freeway 7 at turn 28 is safe (car1: [1, 12], car2: [49, 60], 0 not in intervals).\n- **Turn 28**: Move up (U) to position (0, 8) at turn 29. Freeway 8 at turn 29 is safe (car1: [7, 18], car2: [55, 66], 0 not in intervals).\n- **Turn 29**: Move up (U) to position (0, 9) at turn 30. Position (0, 9) is safe (no freeway).\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches (0, 9) in 12 turns, which is the minimal number of turns required to avoid all collisions based on the car movements and unsafe intervals.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 18: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 19: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 20: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 21: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 22: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 23: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 24: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 25: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 26: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 27: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 28: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 29: \\text{ U}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 2) at turn t_1 = 20. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. Each turn, the player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that exact turn. Also, when moving, you're not on the new row until the next turn, so you only check for collision on the row you're currently on at the start of the turn.\n\nThe car spans move left or right based on their direction and speed. For left-moving cars, the span decreases in position over time, and for right-moving, it increases. But in this problem, all cars seem to be moving right, based on the direction given. Let me check the car states:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, direction right, speed 3\n\n- Freeway 2: one car, direction right, speed 12\n\n- Freeway 3: one car, direction right, speed 12\n\n- Freeway 4: one car, direction right, speed 12\n\n- Freeway 5: one car, direction right, speed 12\n\n- Freeway 6: two cars, both right, speed 12\n\n- Freeway 7: two cars, both right, speed 6\n\n- Freeway 8: two cars, both right, speed 6\n\nAll cars are moving to the right. So for each car, at time T, the span is [τ + s*(T - t_1), h + s*(T - t_1)] for right-moving, since head is greater than tail? In the update rule, it says for right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)]\n\nBut in the initial state, for example, freeway 1: head h = -42, tail τ = -53. Since it's right-moving, head should be on the right, so h = -42 is greater than τ = -53? -42 > -53, yes, so head is at higher x, tail at lower x. But since both are negative, it's moving right, so x increases over time.\n\nSimilarly for others. Freeway 6 has two cars: one at (-48,-59) and one at (24,13), both right, speed 12.\n\nFreeway 7: (-36,-47) and (12,1), both right, speed 6.\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7, (-36,-47) and (12,1), right, speed 6.\n\nt_1 is 20, so we need to find the span at any future turn T for each car.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, player is on freeway k, and for that k, there is a car such that 0 is in [τ + s*(T - t_1), h + s*(T - t_1)].\n\nSince all cars are right-moving, and spans are [start, end] with start < end.\n\nNow, player starts at y=2. We need to go to y=9. Since y=0 is safe? y=0 is not a freeway, I think only y=1 to 8 have cars, and y=0 and y=9 might be safe zones. The grid is from y=0 to 9, and freeways are y=1 to 8. So y=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars to collide with. But collision is defined only for freeways y=1 to 8, I believe.\n\nThe problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1, …, 8\". And \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\".\n\ny_T is the player's y-position at turn T.\n\nSo when player is on y=0 or y=9, there are no cars, so no collision possible. Similarly, moving to y=9, once you're there, it's safe.\n\nBut to reach (0,9), I think we need to end at y=9.\n\nNow, since player is at y=2, and we need to go up to y=9, that's 7 steps up, but we might need to stay or move down to avoid cars, so H might be more than 7.\n\nMinimal H, so we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nEach action changes y by +1, -1, or 0, so to go from 2 to 9, minimum 7 moves up, but if we have to wait or detour, it takes more turns.\n\nNow, we need to check for each freeway, when the cars are at position x=0.\n\nFor a given freeway k, and a car on it, we need to find times T when 0 is in the span, meaning that for some car, min_span <= 0 <= max_span at time T.\n\nSince spans are continuous, we can find the time intervals when a car covers x=0.\n\nThen, for the player to be on that freeway at time T, if 0 is covered at T, collision occurs.\n\nPlayer can be on a freeway only if y_T = k.\n\nSince we start at t_1=20, and we look at future turns, T >= 20.\n\nLet me denote Δt = T - t_1, so for each car, at time T, span is [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt] for right-moving.\n\n0 is in this interval if τ + s*Δt <= 0 <= h + s*Δt.\n\nSince for right-moving, τ <= h, so the span is [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt], and 0 is covered when τ + s*Δt <= 0 and 0 <= h + s*Δt, which is equivalent to:\n\n- h + s*Δt >= 0  => s*Δt >= -h  => Δt >= ceil(-h/s) ? But since Δt integer, we need to find Δt such that τ + s*Δt <= 0 <= h + s*Δt.\n\nSimilarly, the condition is:\n\nlower bound <= 0 <= upper bound, so:\n\nτ + s*Δt <= 0 and h + s*Δt >= 0.\n\nThen from h + s*Δt >= 0, Δt >= ceil(-h/s) ? Since Δt integer, Δt >= ceil(-h/s)\n\nSimilarly, from τ + s*Δt <= 0, Δt <= floor(-τ/s)\n\nBut need both.\n\nLet's compute for each car the times when it covers x=0.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car, h=-42, τ=-53, s=3, right.\n\nSo at Δt, span: [ -53 + 3*Δt, -42 + 3*Δt ]\n\n0 in span if:\n\n-53 + 3*Δt <= 0 <= -42 + 3*Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -53 + 3*Δt <= 0 => 3*Δt <= 53 => Δt <= 53/3 = 17.666, so Δt <= 17 since integer\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -42 + 3*Δt => 42 <= 3*Δt => Δt >= 14\n\nSo for Δt from 14 to 17 inclusive.\n\nSince Δt = T - 20, so at T=34,35,36,37? Δt=14, T=34; Δt=15,T=35; Δt=16,T=36; Δt=17,T=37.\n\nT=20 + Δt.\n\nΔt min=14, T=34; max Δt=17, T=37.\n\nSo on freeway 1, collision possible at T=34,35,36,37.\n\nBut only if player is on y=1 at that time.\n\nNow, freeway 2: one car, h=-48, τ=-59, s=12, right.\n\nSpan: [ -59 + 12*Δt, -48 + 12*Δt ]\n\n0 in span if:\n\n-59 + 12*Δt <= 0 <= -48 + 12*Δt\n\nFirst: -59 + 12*Δt <= 0 => 12*Δt <= 59 => Δt <= 59/12 = 4.916, so Δt <= 4\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 + 12*Δt => 48 <= 12*Δt => Δt >= 4\n\nΔt >=4 and Δt <=4, so only Δt=4\n\nT = 20 + 4 = 24\n\nSo on freeway 2, collision at T=24.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, I think. Car: h=-48, τ=-59, s=12, right.\n\nSame as above, so collision at T=24 only.\n\nFreeway 4: same, h=-48, τ=-59, s=12, collision at T=24.\n\nFreeway 5: same, collision at T=24.\n\nNow freeway 6: two cars.\n\nFirst car: h=-48, τ=-59, s=12, same as above, so collision at T=24.\n\nSecond car: h=24, τ=13, s=12, right. Head h=24, tail τ=13, so span [13,24] at Δt=0? At t_1.\n\nAt time T, span: [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt] = [13 + 12*Δt, 24 + 12*Δt]\n\n0 in span if 13 + 12*Δt <= 0 <= 24 + 12*Δt\n\nFirst: 13 + 12*Δt <= 0 => 12*Δt <= -13 => Δt <= -13/12 = -1.083, but Δt >=0 since future, so never true. 13 +12*Δt is positive for Δt>=0, so lower bound >0, thus 0 not <= lower bound? Condition is lower bound <= 0 <= upper bound.\n\nLower bound = 13 +12*Δt >=13 >0 for Δt>=0, so lower bound >0, thus 0 < lower bound, so 0 not in span. Similarly, upper bound >0, but since lower bound >0, 0 is left of the span, not covered.\n\nSo for this car, 0 is never covered for Δt>=0.\n\nOnly the first car on freeway 6 causes collision at T=24.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: h=-36, τ=-47, s=6, right.\n\nSpan: [ -47 + 6*Δt, -36 + 6*Δt ]\n\n0 in span if:\n\n-47 + 6*Δt <= 0 <= -36 + 6*Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -47 + 6*Δt <= 0 => 6*Δt <= 47 => Δt <= 47/6 ≈ 7.833, so Δt <=7\n\nSecond: 0 <= -36 + 6*Δt => 36 <= 6*Δt => Δt >=6\n\nSo Δt from 6 to 7 inclusive, T=26,27.\n\nSecond car on freeway 7: h=12, τ=1, s=6, right.\n\nSpan: [1 + 6*Δt, 12 + 6*Δt]\n\n0 in span if 1 + 6*Δt <= 0 <= 12 + 6*Δt\n\nFirst: 1 + 6*Δt <=0? For Δt>=0, 1+6Δt >=1>0, so never <=0. Thus 0 not in span.\n\nSo only first car causes collision at T=26,27.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same as freeway 7, cars: (-36,-47,right,6) and (12,1,right,6)\n\nFirst car: same, collision at T=26,27\n\nSecond car: no collision.\n\nNow, summarize the dangerous times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: dangerous at T=34,35,36,37\n\n- y=2: dangerous at T=24\n\n- y=3: dangerous at T=24\n\n- y=4: dangerous at T=24\n\n- y=5: dangerous at T=24\n\n- y=6: dangerous at T=24 (from first car)\n\n- y=7: dangerous at T=26,27\n\n- y=8: dangerous at T=26,27\n\ny=2 has danger at T=24, and player starts at y=2 at T=20.\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, and we start at y=2.\n\nThe dangerous times are only at specific turns: T=24 for y=2,3,4,5,6; T=26,27 for y=7,8; and T=34-37 for y=1.\n\nBut y=1 is below, we might not need to go there.\n\nPlayer needs to go up to y=9.\n\nAt T=20, player is at y=2.\n\nWe need to avoid being on a freeway when it is dangerous.\n\nFor example, at T=24, y=2,3,4,5,6 are dangerous, so player should not be on these rows at T=24.\n\nSimilarly, at T=26,27, y=7 and 8 are dangerous.\n\ny=1 dangerous at T=34-37, but since we are going up, we might not be on y=1 later, but let's see.\n\nFirst, from T=20, y=2.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe critical times are T=24 and T=26,27.\n\nT=24 is 4 turns from now (since T=20,21,22,23,24 is 4 steps later).\n\nT=20 is current turn.\n\nAt turn T, we perform action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nLet me define the sequence.\n\nLet t be the turn index.\n\nAt time t, player position y_t.\n\nAction a_t is taken at turn t, which sets y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nCollision is checked at turn T based on y_T and the cars on that row.\n\nFor example, at t=20, y=2. We need to choose a_{20}, which will set y_{21}.\n\nThen at t=21, we choose a_{21}, set y_{22}, and so on.\n\nDangerous at T=24 for y=2 to 6.\n\nSo if player is on y=2,3,4,5, or 6 at exactly turn T=24, collision occurs.\n\nSimilarly for T=26,27 on y=7 or 8.\n\nAnd for y=1 at T=34-37.\n\nBut since we start at y=2 and go up, we can ignore y=1 for now, as we are unlikely to go down.\n\nSimilarly, T=34-37 is late, we can reach y=9 before that if we go directly.\n\nMinimal H: since from y=2 to y=9, 7 steps up, so H=7 if no delays, but with dangers, we might need to wait or something.\n\nBut the dangers are at specific times, so we can time our movement to avoid those.\n\nFirst, T=24 is at Δt=4, which is 4 turns from now, so at turn t=24.\n\nCurrent turn t=20, so after 0 actions, at t=20, y=2.\n\nAfter 1 action, t=21, y based on a_20.\n\nAfter 2 actions, t=22, y based on a_20 and a_21.\n\nAfter 3 actions, t=23, y\n\nAfter 4 actions, t=24, y\n\nAnd so on.\n\nAt t=24, if y_{24} is between 2 and 6 inclusive, collision.\n\nSimilarly, at t=26, if y_{26} is 7 or 8, collision.\n\nAt t=27, if y_{27} is 7 or 8, collision.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9 at some turn, say t_final, with y_{t_final} =9.\n\nAnd we start at t=20, y=2.\n\nThe minimal possible t_final is t=20 + 7 = 27, if we go up every turn: U,U,U,U,U,U,U, so y: 2→3→4→5→6→7→8→9, at t=27, y=9.\n\nBut at t=24, y would be, let's see: at t=20, y=2\n\na_20=U, y21=3\n\na21=U, y22=4\n\na22=U, y23=5\n\na23=U, y24=6\n\nAt t=24, y=6, which is dangerous (since y=6 has car at T=24), so collision! Not good.\n\nIf we go slower or faster.\n\nWe need to avoid being at y=2,3,4,5,6 at t=24.\n\nSimilarly, for t=26 and 27, avoid y=7 or 8.\n\nIn the direct path, at t=24, y=6, which is bad.\n\nAlso, in the direct path to t=27 y=9, at t=26 y=8, and t=27 y=9.\n\nBut at t=26, y=8, which is dangerous if on y=8 at t=26, which it is, since y=8 dangerous at T=26,27.\n\nSimilarly, t=27 y=9, which is safe.\n\nBut at t=26, y=8 is dangerous, so collision.\n\nSo direct up in 7 steps causes collision at t=24 and t=26.\n\nWe need to delay or change path.\n\nFirst, let's avoid t=24 danger.\n\nWe need that at t=24, y is not in {2,3,4,5,6}.\n\nSince y must be between 0 and 9, possible safe positions at t=24 are y=0,1,7,8,9.\n\ny=0 or 1 might be possible, but y=1 has danger at T=34-37, but t=24 is early, so at t=24, y=1 is safe, since danger only later.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 safe.\n\ny=7,8,9 safe at t=24.\n\nBut y=7 and 8 have danger at later times, but t=24 is before t=26, so at t=24, y=7 or 8 should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 safe.\n\nNow, from start y=2 at t=20, to reach, say, y=7 at t=24.\n\nt=24 is 4 turns later.\n\ny from 2 to 7, difference 5, so we need to go up 5 times in 4 turns, which is impossible since each up only +1, so in 4 turns, max y=2+4=6, min y=2-4=-2 but y>=0, so y at t=24 can be from 0 to 6.\n\nSince we start at y=2, and in 4 steps, y can be from max(0,2-4)=0 to min(9,2+4)=6.\n\nSo at t=24, y must be between 0 and 6 inclusive.\n\nBut we need to avoid y=2,3,4,5,6 at t=24, so only possibility is y=0 or y=1.\n\ny=0 or 1 at t=24.\n\nNow, to achieve that, from y=2 at t=20, we need to decrease y or stay.\n\nFor example, if we go down or stay to reach y=0 or 1 at t=24.\n\nBut we need to go to y=9 eventually, so going down might not be efficient.\n\ny=0 is safe, y=1 is also safe at t=24.\n\nNow, after t=24, we have dangers at t=26,27 on y=7,8.\n\nNow, let's plan the sequence.\n\nFirst, we need y_{24} = 0 or 1.\n\nSince y=0 or 1, and we need to go up to 9.\n\ny=1 has danger later at T=34-37, but we might not be there then.\n\nNow, from t=20 to t=24, 4 turns.\n\nStart y=2.\n\nTo reach y=0 or 1 in 4 turns.\n\nFor example, if we go down once and stay or something.\n\nPossible sequences:\n\nTo reach y=0 at t=24: need to decrease y by 2 in 4 turns. For example, two down and two stay, or one down and three stay, etc.\n\nSimilarly for y=1: decrease by 1 in 4 turns.\n\nSince we want minimal H, we should minimize waiting, so we might go down only if necessary, but here to avoid danger, we need to be low at t=24.\n\nAfter t=24, we can go up fast.\n\nNow, let's compute the y at each turn.\n\nSet t=20: y=2\n\nWe need y_{24} = 0 or 1.\n\nCase 1: y_{24} = 0\n\nThen from y=2 to y=0 in 4 steps, net change -2.\n\nPossible actions: for example, D,D,S,S: then y: t20=2, a20=D, y21=1; a21=D, y22=0; a22=S, y23=0; a23=S, y24=0.\n\nOr D,S,D,S: y20=2, a20=D, y21=1; a21=S, y22=1; a22=D, y23=0; a23=S, y24=0.\n\nEtc.\n\nSimilarly, to reach y_{24}=1: net change -1.\n\nFor example, D,S,S,S: y20=2, a20=D, y21=1; a21=S, y22=1; a22=S, y23=1; a23=S, y24=1.\n\nOr S,D,S,S: etc.\n\nNow, after t=24, we need to go to y=9.\n\nFrom y_{24}, which is 0 or 1, to y=9, need at least 8 or 9 steps up.\n\nBut we have dangers at t=26 and t=27 on y=7 and 8.\n\nt=26 is 2 turns after t=24, since t=24, then t=25, t=26.\n\nSimilarly, t=27 is 3 turns after t=24.\n\nAt t=26, if y_{26} =7 or 8, collision.\n\nAt t=27, if y_{27} =7 or 8, collision.\n\nWe need to avoid that.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nNow, from y_{24}, we start going up.\n\nSuppose we go up as fast as possible.\n\nFirst, if y_{24} =0.\n\nThen:\n\nt=24, y=0\n\na24=U, y25=1\n\na25=U, y26=2\n\na26=U, y27=3\n\na27=U, y28=4\n\nand so on. To reach y=9, from y=0, need 9 ups, so at t=33, y=9? Let's see:\n\nAfter k ups, y = y_{24} + k at t=24+k.\n\ny_{24} =0\n\nAfter 0: t=24, y=0\n\na24=U, t25 y=1\n\na25=U, t26 y=2\n\na26=U, t27 y=3\n\na27=U, t28 y=4\n\na28=U, t29 y=5\n\na29=U, t30 y=6\n\na30=U, t31 y=7\n\na31=U, t32 y=8\n\na32=U, t33 y=9\n\nAt t=26, y=2, which is not 7 or 8, so safe.\n\nt=27, y=3, not 7 or 8, safe.\n\nBut at t=31, y=7, and t=32 y=8, but t=31 and 32 are after t=27, and dangers are only at t=26,27 for y=7,8? t=26 and 27 only.\n\ny=7 and 8 dangerous only at T=26 and 27, which are t=26 and t=27.\n\nFor later times, no danger mentioned for y=7 and 8, except y=1 at T=34-37, but y=7 and 8 should be safe after t=27.\n\nIn this sequence, at t=31 y=7, t=32 y=8, which are after t=27, so no collision, since no cars at those times.\n\nSimilarly, we need to check if on the way up, we hit other dangers, but the only dangers are at specific times: for y=2-6 only at t=24, and y=7-8 at t=26,27, y=1 at t=34-37.\n\nIn this path, from t=24 y=0, going up:\n\nt=25 y=1\n\nt=26 y=2\n\nt=27 y=3\n\nNow at t=26, y=2, is there danger? y=2 dangerous only at t=24, not at t=26. Similarly, y=2 at t=26 is safe, since no car at x=0 on y=2 except at t=24.\n\nSimilarly, t=27 y=3, y=3 dangerous only at t=24, so at t=27, safe.\n\nThen continuing, no other dangers until y=1 at t=34-37, but we are going up, so by t=34, we might be at y=9 or higher.\n\nIn this sequence, at t=33 y=9, which is before t=34.\n\nt=33 is less than 34.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nBut we have y_{24}=0, which required going down to 0.\n\nBut we could have y_{24}=1, which might be better.\n\nFirst, let's see the time to reach y=9.\n\nIf y_{24}=0, then at t=33, y=9, so from t=20 to t=33, that's 13 turns? Let's count the turns.\n\nThe sequence of actions: from t=20 to t=23 to set y_{24}, then from t=24 to t=32 to set y_{33}=9? Let's index properly.\n\nThe player position is set after actions.\n\nAt turn t, we perform action a_t, which sets y_{t+1}.\n\nStart: at turn t=20, position is given as (0,2), so y_{20} =2.\n\nThen we choose a_{20}, which sets y_{21}.\n\nThen a_{21} sets y_{22}, and so on.\n\nWe need y_{t_final} =9 for some t_final.\n\nThe number of actions H: from t=20 to t_final, we have actions from a_{20} to a_{t_final -1}, so H = t_final - 20 actions? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a_{20} to a_{20+H-1}, and after H actions, we reach y_{20 + H} =9? After H actions, the position is y_{20 + H}.\n\nAt turn T, after k actions from start, position y_{20 + k}.\n\nAfter 0 actions, y_{20}.\n\nAfter 1 action, y_{21}, etc.\n\nAfter H actions, y_{20 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{20 + H} =9.\n\nSo H is the number of actions to reach y=9.\n\nIn the minimal path, if no obstacles, from y=2 to y=9, need 7 up actions, so H=7, y_{27}=9.\n\nBut with obstacles, H might be larger.\n\nBack to our plan.\n\nFirst, to avoid t=24 danger, we set y_{24} to 0 or 1.\n\nOption: y_{24}=0.\n\nTo achieve that from y_{20}=2 in 4 actions (t=20 to t=23 actions set y_{24}).\n\nActions at t=20,21,22,23 determine y_{24}.\n\ny_{20}=2\n\nWe need y_{24}=0.\n\nSo net change -2 in 4 steps.\n\nFor example, we can do two down and two stay, or one down and three stay with one down earlier, but since we start at 2, to go to 0.\n\nMinimal down: we need to decrease, so at least two down if we do no up, but we can do stay and down.\n\nTo minimize time, we should not stay if possible, but here we need to be low at t=24, so we might do down actions.\n\nBut down might be inefficient for reaching high y.\n\nSince we need to go up later, doing down now costs extra steps.\n\nSimilarly for y_{24}=1, net change -1, which requires only one down or more stay.\n\ny_{24}=1 might be better because we start higher for the ascent.\n\nSet y_{24}=1.\n\nThen from y_{20}=2 to y_{24}=1 in 4 steps: net change -1.\n\nPossible with one down and three stay.\n\nFor example: a_{20}=S, then y_{21}=2 (since S, Δy=0)\n\na_{20} action at t=20 sets y_{21} = y_{20} + Δy.\n\nIf a_{20}=S, y_{21}=y_{20}=2\n\nIf a_{20}=D, y_{21}=y_{20}-1=1\n\nThen similarly.\n\nTo have y_{24}=1 from y_{20}=2.\n\nSince we need to decrease by 1 in 4 steps, we can have one down and three stay, but the down can be at any of the four actions.\n\nNow, after t=24, y_{24}=1\n\nThen we go up as fast as possible: U every turn.\n\ny_{24}=1\n\na_{24}=U, y_{25}=2\n\na_{25}=U, y_{26}=3\n\na_{26}=U, y_{27}=4\n\na_{27}=U, y_{28}=5\n\na_{28}=U, y_{29}=6\n\na_{29}=U, y_{30}=7\n\na_{30}=U, y_{31}=8\n\na_{31}=U, y_{32}=9\n\nSo y_{32}=9.\n\nNow, check collisions.\n\nFirst, at t=24, y_{24}=1, which is safe, since no danger at t=24 for y=1.\n\nNow, during ascent:\n\nt=25, y=2: is there danger? y=2 dangerous only at t=24, not at t=25, so safe.\n\nt=26, y=3: y=3 dangerous only at t=24, not at t=26, safe.\n\nt=27, y=4: similarly safe.\n\nNow, at t=30, y=7: but y=7 dangerous at t=26 and 27, not at t=30, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=31 y=8, danger at t=26,27 only, safe.\n\nt=32 y=9, safe.\n\nWe also need to check if we hit y=1 at dangerous times, but at t=25, y=2, not 1.\n\ny_{24}=1, but t=24 is before 34, so safe.\n\nIn this sequence, we reach y=9 at t=32.\n\nH is the number of actions: from t=20 to t=31, actions a_{20} to a_{31}, that's 12 actions? Let's see: actions at t=20,21,22,23 to set y_{24}, then t=24 to t=31 to set y_{32}.\n\nt=20 to t=31 inclusive is 12 actions? t from 20 to 31 is 12 turns, but actions: a_{20} to a_{31}, that's 12 actions, and y_{32} is set after a_{31}.\n\nAfter H actions, y_{20+H} =9.\n\nHere y_{32} =9, so 20 + H =32, thus H=12.\n\nBut we can do better?\n\nIf we set y_{24}=0, then from y_{24}=0, go up: y_{24}=0, a24=U, y25=1; a25=U, y26=2; ... up to y32=8, y33=9, so H=13 actions to y_{33}=9, worse.\n\nSo y_{24}=1 is better.\n\nBut with y_{24}=1, H=12.\n\nBut is there a way with less than 12?\n\nPerhaps we don't need to be at y=1 at t=24; we could be higher but avoid the danger zone.\n\nEarlier I thought at t=24, y must be 0 or 1, but is that necessary?\n\ny at t=24 can be from 0 to 6, and dangerous if 2-6, so only 0 or 1 safe.\n\nBut y=7,8,9 are safe but unreachable at t=24 since max y=6.\n\nSo yes, only y=0 or 1 possible and safe at t=24.\n\nSo we must have y_{24}=0 or 1.\n\nWith y_{24}=1, we reach y=9 at t=32, H=12.\n\nBut we have dangers at t=26 and 27 for y=7,8, but in the above, we are not on y=7 or 8 at those times.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=26, y=3, not 7 or 8.\n\nt=27, y=4.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut can we reach faster?\n\nFor example, if we can be at a higher y earlier, but at t=24 we must be low.\n\nPerhaps we can go up faster after t=24, but we are going up as fast as possible.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps we can reach y=9 before t=26 or 27, but from y_{24}=1, min to y=9 is 8 steps, so at best y_{32}=9, as above.\n\nt=24 to t=32 is 8 turns, y from 1 to 9.\n\nBut t=32 is after t=27.\n\nPerhaps we can avoid the t=24 danger by being on safe row at t=24, which we are, but maybe we can start going up earlier if we stay, but we need to be low at t=24.\n\nFor example, suppose at t=20, we go up, but then at t=24 we might be high.\n\nBut we can't be high at t=24 because of danger.\n\nSuppose we go up to y=6 quickly, but before t=24, and then at t=24, we are not on y=6.\n\nFor example, from y=2 at t=20, if we go up three times: a20=U, y21=3; a21=U, y22=4; a22=U, y23=5; then at t=23, y=5.\n\nNow, at t=23, we need to set a23 such that y24 is safe.\n\ny24 = y23 + Δy.\n\nIf a23=U, y24=6, but y=6 dangerous at t=24.\n\nIf a23=D, y24=4, but y=4 dangerous at t=24.\n\nIf a23=S, y24=5, dangerous.\n\nAll lead to y24 in 4,5,6, all dangerous.\n\nFrom t=23 y=5, no choice to make y24 safe except if we could be lower, but we are at 5.\n\nStart from t=20, if we go up only two times: a20=U, y21=3; a21=U, y22=4; then at t=22 y=4.\n\nThen a22: if U, y23=5; then a23 as above, same problem.\n\nIf a22=D, y23=3; then a23: if S, y24=3 dangerous; if D, y24=2 dangerous; if U, y24=4 dangerous.\n\nStill y24 dangerous.\n\nIf we go up only once: a20=U, y21=3; then at t=21 y=3.\n\na21: if S, y22=3; a22: ... still can get to low, but let's see.\n\nTo have y24=0 or 1, we need to decrease or stay, not increase much.\n\nFor example, from t=20 y=2, if we do a20=S, y21=2; a21=S, y22=2; a22=S, y23=2; then a23: if S, y24=2 dangerous; if D, y24=1 safe; if U, y24=3 dangerous.\n\nSo only if a23=D, y24=1.\n\nSimilarly, if a20=D, y21=1; then we can stay or go down, but to have y24=1, we need to stay or something.\n\nBut in all cases, to achieve y24=1, we need some down or stay actions before.\n\nThe fastest to y=9 might be with y24=1 and then up.\n\nBut H=12.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=9 earlier if we don't waste time going down, but we have to avoid t=24.\n\nAnother thought: the danger at t=24 is only for y=2 to 6, but if we can be on y=7 or 8 at t=24, but we can't, since max y=6.\n\ny=1 is safe at t=24.\n\nBut there is also y=0.\n\nBut y=1 is closer.\n\nIn the sequence with y24=1, we have to do one down action or multiple stay to decrease by one.\n\nIn terms of time, since we have to take 4 actions to t=24 with net -1, we have inefficiency.\n\nFor example, to go from y=2 to y=1 in 4 steps with minimal actions, we can do one down and three stay, but the down can be early.\n\nThen after, we go up.\n\nBut in the up phase, from y=1 at t=24 to y=9 at t=32, that takes 8 up actions, no stay.\n\nTotal actions: from t=20 to t=31, 12 actions.\n\nBut the actions include stays or down.\n\nTo minimize H, we need to minimize the number of actions, so we should avoid unnecessary actions, but here the down or stay is necessary to avoid collision.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 without being at low y, but by timing so that when we pass through dangerous rows, it's not at dangerous times.\n\nFor example, for y=2, dangerous only at t=24, so we can be on y=2 at other times, like t=20,21,etc., safe.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nIn the direct up path, we were on y=6 at t=24, which is bad, and y=8 at t=26, bad.\n\nBut if we delay or advance the timing.\n\nFor instance, suppose we start by staying or going down for a few turns to shift the time we are on higher rows.\n\nFor example, suppose we stay at y=2 for a few turns.\n\nAt t=20, y=2.\n\nIf we do a20=S, y21=2\n\na21=S, y22=2\n\na22=S, y23=2\n\nNow at t=23, y=2.\n\nThen we need to set y24.\n\nIf we do a23=D, y24=1, safe.\n\nThen from there, go up.\n\nBut same as before.\n\nFrom t=23 y=2, if we could go up but not be on dangerous row at wrong time.\n\nBut at t=24, if we go up, y24=3 if a23=U, but y=3 dangerous at t=24.\n\nNot good.\n\nGo down to y=1 at t=24.\n\nSame.\n\nSuppose we go up immediately but slower.\n\nFor example, a20=U, y21=3\n\nBut at t=21, y=3, which is safe, since danger only at t=24 for y=3.\n\nThen a21=S, y22=3\n\na22=S, y23=3\n\nThen at t=23 y=3, a23: if S, y24=3 dangerous; if U, y24=4 dangerous; if D, y24=2 dangerous. All bad.\n\nSo no way to avoid y24 being dangerous if we are at y>=2 at t=23 and go to y=2-6 at t=24.\n\nUnless we can be at y=1 or 0.\n\nBut to be at y=1 or 0 at t=24, we need to decrease from y=2.\n\nSo I think we must have y24=0 or 1.\n\nThus, minimal H is at least: from y=2 to y=9, 7 steps, but with detour to y=1, so 1 extra down, then 8 up, but the down is part of the actions, and we have waits.\n\nIn terms of net movement, to go from 2 to 9, need +7, but we go to 1 first, so net we do one extra down and one less up or something, but with actions.\n\nFrom start, to reach y=1 at t=24, we have 4 actions to decrease by 1, so we have one down and three stay, or other combinations, but the down action doesn't help progress, similarly stay.\n\nThen from y=1 to y=9, 8 up actions.\n\nTotal actions: 4 to reach y24=1, then 8 to reach y32=9, total 12 actions.\n\nThe 4 actions include the movement to y=1.\n\nSince we start at y=2, to be at y=1 at t=24, we can do it with one down and three S, or for example, a20=D, y21=1; then a21=S, y22=1; a22=S, y23=1; a23=S, y24=1. So actions: D,S,S,S.\n\nThen from t=24: a24=U, y25=2; a25=U, y26=3; a26=U, y27=4; a27=U, y28=5; a28=U, y29=6; a29=U, y30=7; a30=U, y31=8; a31=U, y32=9.\n\nSo actions from t=20 to t=31: a20 to a31, 12 actions.\n\nWe could have the down later, but same.\n\nNow, about the dangers at t=26 and 27: in this sequence, at t=26, y=3, not 7 or 8; t=27, y=4, not 7 or 8. So safe.\n\nBut we need to make sure that we don't have collision on other rows at other times.\n\nFor example, when on y=1, at t=25, y=2? In this sequence, at t=25, y=2, which is safe.\n\ny=1 at t=24,25? t=24 y=1, t=25 y=2 after a24=U.\n\nt=25 y=2.\n\ny=1 dangerous only at T=34-37, which is later, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut can we save a turn?\n\nSuppose we do not stay as much.\n\nFor example, to reach y24=1, we can do only one down and the rest up, but we need net decrease, so we must have down or stay.\n\nMinimal actions to decrease y by 1 in time: since we have 4 turns to change, we can do one down and three up, but then y would increase, not decrease.\n\nFor example, a20=U, y21=3; a21=U, y22=4; but we need y24=1, not possible to go down that much.\n\nWith down: a20=D, y21=1; then we are at y=1 early, but we need to be at y=1 at t=24, so we can stay at y=1 for the remaining turns.\n\nIf we go down early: a20=D, y21=1; then we can go up from there, but at t=24 we need to be at y=1, so if we go up before t=24, y increases.\n\nFor example, if a20=D, y21=1; then if a21=U, y22=2; a22=U, y23=3; then at t=23 y=3, and a23 must set y24, but as before, can't make it safe except down to 2 or something, but y=2 dangerous.\n\nIf from y21=1, we do a21=S, y22=1; a22=S, y23=1; a23=S, y24=1. Same as before.\n\nIf we do a21=U, but then y22=2, and so on, we end up at y=3 or 4 at t=24, dangerous.\n\nSo we must stay or go down to keep y low until t=24.\n\nThus, no faster way to y=9.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach before considering the t=26 danger.\n\nIn the above, we reach at t=32.\n\nBut with y24=1, and then up, we are at y=7 at t=30, which is after t=27, so no danger.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=9 at t=27 or earlier.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at t=27, we need y27=9.\n\nFrom t=20 y=2, in 7 actions to y27.\n\nBut at t=24, which is after 4 actions, y24 must be between 0 and 6, and to avoid danger, must be 0 or 1.\n\nIf y24=0 or 1, then from there to y27 in 3 actions: max y increase is +3, so y27 <= y24 +3 <= 1+3=4 <9, impossible.\n\nSimilarly, if y24=0, y27<=3.\n\nCannot reach y=9 by t=27 if we are low at t=24.\n\nIf we are higher at t=24, but we can't because of danger or max y=6<9.\n\nSo impossible to reach y=9 before t=27? t=27 is y after 7 actions.\n\nBut with y24 low, y27 <= y24 +3 <=4, so y=9 not possible until later.\n\nEarliest possible is when we start going up after t=24.\n\nFrom y24=1, min to y=9 is at t=32.\n\nBut t=32 is 12 turns after start? t=20 to t=32 is 12 steps? y_{20} to y_{32}, 12 steps.\n\nNumber of actions from a20 to a31 to set y32.\n\nH=12.\n\nBut let's see if we can do with H=11 or less.\n\nSuppose we accept the down but minimize stays.\n\nFor example, to have y24=1, we can do a20=D, y21=1; then we are at y=1 early, so we can start going up immediately.\n\nBut at t=24, we need to be at y=1, so we cannot go up before t=24.\n\nFor example, if a20=D, y21=1; then a21=U, y22=2; but then at t=22 y=2, we need to set for t=24.\n\nIf we go up, y increases, cannot stay at 1.\n\nTo keep y=1 until t=24, we must do S or D from y=1, but D would go to 0.\n\nBut if we go to y=0, it might take longer.\n\nFor example, a20=D, y21=1; then a21=S, y22=1; a22=S, y23=1; a23=S, y24=1. Same as before.\n\na20=D, y21=1; a21=S, y22=1; a22=S, y23=1; then at t=23, y=1, we can do a23=U, but then y24=2, which is dangerous at t=24.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo we must have a23 such that y24=1, so a23=S or if lower, but we are at 1, so a23=S.\n\nThus, we need to stay at y=1 for the last turns if we go down early.\n\nNo saving.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=0 at t=24 and go up faster, but from 0 to 9 takes 9 steps, so y33=9, later.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo minimal H is 12 with y24=1.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have actions including S, which are not progress, but necessary.\n\nNow, about the t=26 and t=27 dangers: in our sequence, we are not on y=7 or 8 at those times, so fine.\n\nBut let's write the full sequence.\n\nWe need to specify the actions.\n\nFrom above, one way: actions to set y24=1.\n\nFor example, a20 = D  // go down to y=1 at t=21\n\nThen to stay until t=24: a21 = S, a22 = S, a23 = S  // so y22=1, y23=1, y24=1\n\nThen a24 = U  // y25=2\n\na25 = U  // y26=3\n\na26 = U  // y27=4\n\na27 = U  // y28=5\n\na28 = U  // y29=6\n\na29 = U  // y30=7\n\na30 = U  // y31=8\n\na31 = U  // y32=9\n\nNow, y32=9, reached.\n\nH=12 actions: from a20 to a31.\n\nThe sequence should be from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so a20 to a20+11? t_1=20, H=12, so actions a_{20} to a_{31}, since t from 0 to 11 for the offset.\n\n{ a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a20 to a_{20+H-1}.\n\nHere H=12, so a20 to a31.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=30, y=7, but t=30 is after t=27, and no danger for y=7 at that time, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut we have three stay actions at t=21,22,23, which might be reduced if we do the down later.\n\nFor example, suppose we stay first, then down at the end.\n\na20 = S  // y21=2\n\na21 = S  // y22=2\n\na22 = S  // y23=2\n\na23 = D  // y24=1\n\nThen same as before, a24 to a31 U, y32=9.\n\nSame number of actions.\n\na20 = D  // y21=1\n\na21 = S  // y22=1\n\na22 = S  // y23=1\n\na23 = S  // y24=1\n\nThen up.\n\nIn terms of the sequence, we can choose.\n\nNow, but in the up part, from y=1 to y=9 in 8 steps.\n\nBut we need to consider the t=26 danger.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=26, y=3, which is fine.\n\nBut y=3 has no danger except at t=24, so safe.\n\nNow, another thing: freeway 6 has a second car, but we saw it doesn't cause issue.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut we need to output the sequence.\n\nBut H=12 seems long, but necessary.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=9 without being at y=1 at t=24, by being on a safe row at critical times.\n\nFor example, at t=24, if we can be on y=7, but impossible.\n\nOr, we can be on y=1, which is safe.\n\nBut y=1 has danger at later times, but not at t=24.\n\nIn our sequence, we are on y=1 only at t=24, and then go up.\n\nAt t=25, we are at y=2, not 1.\n\nSo no issue with later dangers.\n\nNow, about the answer format.\n\nWe need to list the actions from turn t_1=20.\n\nSo for H=12:\n\nTurn 20: D  // or S, but let's pick one.\n\nTo make it consistent, let's choose to go down first.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 20: D  // y21=1\n\nTurn 21: S  // y22=1\n\nTurn 22: S  // y23=1\n\nTurn 23: S  // y24=1\n\nTurn 24: U  // y25=2\n\nTurn 25: U  // y26=3\n\nTurn 26: U  // y27=4\n\nTurn 27: U  // y28=5\n\nTurn 28: U  // y29=6\n\nTurn 29: U  // y30=7\n\nTurn 30: U  // y31=8\n\nTurn 31: U  // y32=9\n\ny32=9 after a31.\n\nNow, H=12, sequence from t=20 to t=31.\n\nBut at t=26, y=3, safe; t=27, y=4, safe.\n\nIs there a way with H=11?\n\nSuppose we do only three actions to set y24, but with y24=1.\n\nFrom y20=2 to y24=1 in 3 actions? Actions at t=20,21,22 set y23, then a23 sets y24.\n\ny23 = y20 + sum of first three actions.\n\nThen y24 = y23 + Δy from a23.\n\nTo have y24=1.\n\ny23 can be from 0 to 5, since three actions from y=2.\n\nIf y23=1, then a23=S, y24=1.\n\nOr y23=2, a23=D, y24=1.\n\nOr y23=0, a23=U, y24=1, etc.\n\nBut we need to achieve y23 such that with a23 we get y24=1.\n\nFor example, if we can have y23=1, then a23=S, y24=1.\n\nOr y23=2, a23=D, y24=1.\n\nNow, from y20=2, to y23=1 in three actions: net change -1.\n\nPossible, e.g., a20=D, y21=1; then to have y23=1, we need a21 and a22 such that y23=1.\n\nIf a21=S, y22=1; a22=S, y23=1; then a23=S, y24=1.\n\nBut this has two S, same as before but one less action? Actions: t=20,21,22,23.\n\nIn this, a20=D, a21=S, a22=S, then y23=1, then a23=S, y24=1.\n\nThen from t=24, go up to y=9 in 8 actions, so up to a31 U, y32=9, same as before, 12 actions.\n\nFrom above, with a20=D, y21=1; a21=S, y22=1; a22=S, y23=1; a23=S, y24=1; then up.\n\nBut if we want y24=1 with y23=1 and a23=S.\n\nBut we have four actions to set y24=1.\n\nTo set y24, we need actions t=20 to t=23.\n\nIf we can set y23=2, then a23=D, y24=1.\n\nFor example: a20=S, y21=2; a21=S, y22=2; a22=S, y23=2; then a23=D, y24=1.\n\nThen same.\n\na20=U, but y21=3; then to go down, but messy.\n\nNo saving.\n\nThus, H=12 seems minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 6 second car: we said no issue.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nPerhaps we can go directly but avoid t=24 by being on y=1 at that time.\n\nAnother idea: since y=7 and 8 are dangerous at t=26 and 27, we can be on them before or after.\n\nBut in our sequence, we are on them late.\n\nFor example, if we could be on y=8 at t=25 or something, but with y low at t=24, we can't.\n\nSuppose we go up to y=6 before t=24, but at t=24 we must be low, so not possible.\n\nI think 12 is best.\n\nBut let's list the sequence in the box.\n\nWe need to output the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, we have three S at t=21,22,23, which might not be necessary if we do the down later, but same.\n\nTo make it with less stay, we can do the down at t=23.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 20: S  // y21=2\n\nTurn 21: S  // y22=2\n\nTurn 22: S  // y23=2\n\nTurn 23: D  // y24=1\n\nTurn 24: U  // y25=2\n\nTurn 25: U  // y26=3\n\nTurn 26: U  // y27=4\n\nTurn 27: U  // y28=5\n\nTurn 28: U  // y29=6\n\nTurn 29: U  // y30=7\n\nTurn 30: U  // y31=8\n\nTurn 31: U  // y32=9\n\nSame.\n\nIn this, at t=26, y=3; t=27, y=4.\n\nBut t=27 is the turn where we do U, and y27=4.\n\ny=4 is safe.\n\nNow, but the problem says to reach (0,9), and we do at t=32.\n\nBut is there a sequence with H=11?\n\nSuppose we accept being on a dangerous row but not at critical time, but at t=24 we must avoid.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=1 at t=24, but then go up faster, but we can't.\n\nAnother thought: at t=26 and t=27, y=7 and 8 dangerous, but if we can be on y=9 at t=26 or earlier.\n\nBut from y=2 at t=20, to y=9 at t=26, that's 6 actions: y26=9.\n\nBut at t=24, y24 must be y26 minus two actions, so y24 <= 9-0=9, but min from y=2 in 4 actions is 0, but y24 must be 0 or 1 to be safe.\n\nIf y24=1, then to y26=9 in two actions: max y increase +2, so y26 <= 1+2=3 <9, impossible.\n\nSimilarly, cannot.\n\nThus, impossible with H<12.\n\nSo minimal H is 12.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we have to specify the actions.\n\nIn the output, it should be like:\n\nTurn 20: S\n\nTurn 21: S\n\nTurn 22: S\n\nTurn 23: D\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nWith this, y32=9.\n\nBut at turn 31, action U sets y32=9.\n\nThe last action is at turn 31.\n\nNow, but we need to confirm no collision.\n\nFor example, at t=24, y=1, safe.\n\nt=25, y=2, safe.\n\nt=26, y=3, safe.\n\n...\n\nt=30, y=7, but t=30 > t=27, and no danger for y=7 at t=30, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\ny=7 dangerous only at t=26,27, so other times safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 1 has danger at t=34-37, but we are at y=9 before, so no issue.\n\nThus, this should work.\n\nTo make it with one less stay, but we can't.\n\nIn the beginning, we have three S, but we can have different actions.\n\nFor example, a20=D, y21=1; then a21=S, y22=1; a22=S, y23=1; a23=S, y24=1; same as before.\n\nNo improvement.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nThus, the sequence is as above.\n\nNow for the answer format.\n\nWe need to box it.\n\nBut let's write it clearly.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 20\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 12. The sequence of actions is designed to avoid the dangerous times identified for each freeway:\n\n- At turn \\(T = 24\\), freeways \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\) are dangerous due to cars covering position \\(x = 0\\). To avoid collision, the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) or \\(y = 1\\) at this turn, as these positions are safe.\n- At turns \\(T = 26\\) and \\(T = 27\\), freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) are dangerous. The sequence ensures the player is not on these rows at these times.\n\nStarting from \\(y_{20} = 2\\), the actions are chosen to reach \\(y_{24} = 1\\) safely by turn 24. Then, from turn 24 onwards, the player moves up consistently to reach \\(y_{32} = 9\\) by turn 32.\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n- Turns 20 to 22: Stay (S) to maintain position near \\(y = 2\\), but not moving up to avoid being in the danger zone at \\(T = 24\\).\n- Turn 23: Move down (D) to reach \\(y_{24} = 1\\), which is safe at \\(T = 24\\).\n- Turns 24 to 31: Move up (U) repeatedly to reach \\(y_{32} = 9\\), avoiding the danger at \\(T = 26\\) and \\(T = 27\\) by being at lower \\(y\\) values (\\(y = 3\\) at \\(T = 26\\) and \\(y = 4\\) at \\(T = 27\\), which are safe.\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions, as verified against the car movements:\n- At \\(T = 24\\), \\(y = 1\\) is safe (no car covers \\(x = 0\\) on \\(y = 1\\) at this time).\n- At \\(T = 26\\) and \\(T = 27\\), the player is at \\(y = 3\\) and \\(y = 4\\), respectively, which are safe (danger only at \\(T = 24\\) for these rows).\n- At other times, the player's position does not coincide with dangerous freeway-time pairs.\n\nThe actions minimize \\(H\\) by avoiding unnecessary detours while ensuring safety.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 20: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 21: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 22: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 23: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 24: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 25: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 26: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 27: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 28: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 29: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 30: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 31: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

The player can move up, down, or stay each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\nCars move left or right with given speeds, and I collide if at some turn T, I'm on a freeway y, and for that freeway, 0 is within the span of a car at that turn. Importantly, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn. So if I move up from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1.\n\nThe car states are given for turn t1=24. I need to find actions from turn 24 onwards.\n\nFirst, let's list the car positions at turn 24 for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car, head -48, tail -59, direction right, speed 3. Since direction is right, span is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? No, let's read carefully.\n\nThe table says: Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nAnd for left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → moves left, so h decreases.\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → moves right, so τ and h increase.\n\nIn the update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nRight-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSo for right-moving, at time t, the span is [τ, h] with τ < h, I assume, since it's moving right.\n\nSimilarly for left, [h, τ] with h < τ? No.\n\nIn left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ], and it moves left, so h decreases, τ decreases, so if it's moving left, the head is on the left? I think I need to interpret the coordinates.\n\nAssume that x=0 is the point we care about, and cars are on the x-axis, moving.\n\nFor collision, we care if 0 is in the span at turn T.\n\nFor freeway 1: one car, head h = -48, tail τ = -59, direction right, speed 3.\n\nDirection right, so at t1=24, span is [τ, h] = [-59, -48], since right-moving.\n\nAnd it's moving right, so speed 3, so at time T, span is [-59 + 3(T-24), -48 + 3(T-24)]\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nFreeway 2: one car, head 48, tail 37, direction right, speed 12. So span at t1: [τ, h] = [37, 48]\n\nMoving right: [37 + 12(T-24), 48 + 12(T-24)]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? Head 48, tail 37, right, speed 12. Identical to freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: same, head 48, tail 37, right, speed 12.\n\nFreeway 5: same, head 48, tail 37, right, speed 12.\n\nAll freeways 2,3,4,5 have the same car? That seems odd, but okay.\n\nFreeway 6: two cars: (48, 37, right, 12) and (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: same as above, [37,48] at t1, moving right.\n\nSecond car: head 0, tail -11, direction right, speed 12. So span [τ, h] = [-11, 0] at t1.\n\nMoving right: [-11 + 12(T-24), 0 + 12(T-24)] = [12(T-24) -11, 12(T-24)]\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (-48, -59, right, 6) and (0, -11, right, 6)\n\nFirst car: head -48, tail -59, right, speed 6. Span [ -59, -48 ] at t1.\n\nMoving right: [ -59 + 6(T-24), -48 + 6(T-24) ]\n\nSecond car: head 0, tail -11, right, speed 6. Span [ -11, 0 ] at t1.\n\nMoving right: [ -11 + 6(T-24), 0 + 6(T-24) ]\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7: (-48, -59, right, 6) and (0, -11, right, 6)\n\nNow, I start at y=0 at turn 24. I need to reach y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there. Freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nSo at y=0 and y=9, no collision possible.\n\nI need to move through y=1 to 8 without being at a position where for that y, at that turn, 0 is in the car span.\n\nAlso, when I move, I'm only on one y per turn.\n\nThe goal is to be at (0,9) at some turn T, so y_T =9.\n\nNow, since I start at y=0, and need to go to y=9, I must increase y by 9, so at least 9 moves up, but I can also move down or stay, so H could be more than 9.\n\nBut since I want minimal H, I should avoid unnecessary moves, so probably go up as much as possible, but avoiding cars.\n\nNow, the cars are moving, so I need to time my crossings so that when I'm on a freeway, no car covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nAlso, since cars move continuously, I need to find times when 0 is not covered for each freeway.\n\nFirst, for each freeway, I need to find the times when 0 is not in any car span on that freeway.\n\nThat is, for each y, the times T when for all cars on that y, 0 not in span(T).\n\nThen, for my path, when I am on y at turn T, it must be that at turn T, for freeway y, 0 is not covered.\n\nNow, since I move step by step, I need to plan the sequence.\n\nBut first, let's find for each freeway the set of turns when it is safe to be on that row.\n\nTurns are discrete, I assume, since actions are per turn.\n\nt1=24 is the current turn.\n\nLet t = T - 24, so t=0 is turn 24, t=1 is turn 25, etc.\n\nSet τ = T - 24, so τ=0 is now.\n\nThen for each freeway, find for which τ, position x=0 is not occupied by any car on that freeway.\n\nStart with freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, right-moving, span at τ=0: [ -59, -48 ]\n\nAt time τ, span: [ -59 + 3τ, -48 + 3τ ]\n\n0 is in span if -59 + 3τ ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 3τ\n\nSo -59 + 3τ ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -48 + 3τ\n\nFirst inequality: 3τ ≤ 59, τ ≤ 59/3 ≈ 19.666, so τ ≤ 19\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -48 + 3τ, so 48 ≤ 3τ, τ ≥ 16\n\nSo 16 ≤ τ ≤ 19\n\nThus, for τ=16,17,18,19, 0 is occupied.\n\nOtherwise, for τ <16 or τ>19, safe.\n\nτ is integer, since turns are discrete.\n\nτ=0 to, say, whatever.\n\nNow freeway 2: one car, [37,48] at τ=0, moving right, span [37 + 12τ, 48 + 12τ]\n\n0 in span: 37 + 12τ ≤ 0 ≤ 48 + 12τ\n\nBut 37 + 12τ ≤ 0? Since τ≥0, 37+12τ ≥37>0, so left end >0, so 0 < left end, so 0 not in [left, right] since left >0.\n\nSimilarly, for all τ, 37+12τ ≥37>0, so 0 is never in the span because the car is to the right.\n\nSimilarly for freeways 3,4,5: all have the same car, head 48, tail 37, both positive, moving right, so span always positive, so 0 never covered. So freeways 2,3,4,5 are always safe at all times.\n\nIs that right? Tail 37, head 48, both at least 37>0, so yes, the car is always to the right of 0, so for all τ, 0 not in [37+12τ, 48+12τ] since left end >0.\n\nSo freeways 2,3,4,5 are permanently safe; no car ever covers x=0.\n\nNow freeway 6: two cars.\n\nFirst car: same as above, [37,48] at τ=0, moving right, span [37+12τ, 48+12τ], always positive, so never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: head 0, tail -11, direction right, speed 12.\n\nAt τ=0, span [ -11, 0 ]\n\nMoving right: [ -11 + 12τ, 0 + 12τ ] = [12τ -11, 12τ]\n\n0 in span: 12τ -11 ≤ 0 ≤ 12τ\n\nWhich is always true? 12τ -11 ≤ 0 implies τ ≤ 11/12 <1, so for τ=0, 12*0 -11 = -11 ≤ 0 ≤ 0, which is true, 0 ≤ 0.\n\n0 is included at τ=0.\n\nFor τ=0: [ -11, 0], so 0 is the head, so yes, 0 is included.\n\nFor τ=1: [12*1 -11, 12*1] = [1,12], so 0 not in [1,12] since 1>0.\n\nSimilarly for τ>0, 12τ -11 ≥ 12*1 -11=1>0 for τ≥1, so left end >0, so 0 not covered.\n\nFor τ=0: covered.\n\nNow, τ=0 is turn t1=24, but for freeway 6, at τ=0, second car covers 0.\n\nBut I might not be on freeway 6 at τ=0.\n\nFor safety, at time τ, 0 is covered only if in the span.\n\nFor second car: 0 in [12τ -11, 12τ]\n\n12τ -11 ≤ 0 ≤ 12τ\n\nSince 12τ -11 ≤ 0 implies τ ≤ 11/12 <1, so only for τ=0, since τ integer ≥0.\n\nFor τ=0: -11 ≤ 0 ≤ 0, true.\n\nFor τ=1: 1 ≤ 0 ≤ 12? 0 ≤ 12 true, but 1 ≤ 0 false, so 0 not ≥ left end.\n\nThe inequality: 12τ -11 ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 12τ.\n\n0 ≤ 12τ always for τ≥0.\n\n12τ -11 ≤ 0 only for τ ≤ 11/12, so τ=0.\n\nThus, only at τ=0, 0 is covered by second car.\n\nFirst car never covers 0.\n\nSo for freeway 6, at τ=0, unsafe (covered), for τ≥1, safe.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: head -48, tail -59, right, speed 6. Span at τ=0: [ -59, -48 ]\n\nAt τ: [ -59 + 6τ, -48 + 6τ ]\n\n0 in span: -59 + 6τ ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 6τ\n\nSo -59 + 6τ ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -48 + 6τ\n\nFirst: 6τ ≤ 59, τ ≤ 59/6 ≈ 9.833, τ ≤ 9\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48 + 6τ, 48 ≤ 6τ, τ ≥ 8\n\nSo τ ≥ 8 and τ ≤ 9, so τ=8,9\n\nThus, for τ=8 and 9, 0 covered by first car.\n\nNow second car on freeway 7: head 0, tail -11, right, speed 6. Span at τ=0: [ -11, 0 ]\n\nAt τ: [ -11 + 6τ, 0 + 6τ ] = [6τ -11, 6τ]\n\n0 in span: 6τ -11 ≤ 0 ≤ 6τ\n\n0 ≤ 6τ always true for τ≥0.\n\n6τ -11 ≤ 0 implies τ ≤ 11/6 ≈ 1.833, so τ=0,1\n\nThus for τ=0 and 1, 0 covered by second car.\n\nNow, for freeway 7, unsafe if either car covers 0.\n\nSo unsafe when:\n\n- τ=0: covered by second car\n\n- τ=1: covered by second car\n\n- τ=8: covered by first car\n\n- τ=9: covered by first car\n\nAlso, for other τ, safe.\n\nτ=2 to 7 and τ≥10, safe.\n\nτ=2,3,4,5,6,7: not 8 or 9, and not 0 or 1, so yes.\n\nτ=10: first car span [ -59+60, -48+60] = [1,12], 0 not in, second car [60-11,60]=[49,60], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow freeway 8: same as freeway 7, since cars identical.\n\nFreeway 8: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6), same as freeway 7.\n\nSo unsafe at τ=0,1,8,9.\n\nNow, also freeway 1: unsafe at τ=16,17,18,19\n\nFreeway 2,3,4,5: always safe\n\nFreeway 6: unsafe at τ=0, safe for τ≥1\n\nτ=0 unsafe, τ≥1 safe.\n\nNow, I start at y=0 at τ=0 (turn 24).\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nI must go through y=1 to 8.\n\nThe minimal H would be if I go directly up, but I need to avoid unsafe times.\n\nSince freeways 2,3,4,5 are always safe, I can be on them any time.\n\nBut I need to get to them and from them.\n\nNow, the problematic freeways are 1,6,7,8.\n\nSpecifically, at the beginning, freeway 6 is unsafe at τ=0, but safe after.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 unsafe at τ=0 and 1, and also at τ=8,9.\n\nFreeway 1 unsafe at τ=16-19.\n\nτ=0 is now, turn 24.\n\nI start at y=0, τ=0.\n\nIf I go up to y=1 at τ=0, but at τ=0, I would be on y=1 at turn 24.\n\nFreeway 1: at τ=0, is it safe? From above, freeway 1 unsafe only at τ=16-19, so at τ=0, safe. τ=0 <16, so safe.\n\nBut freeway 1 is y=1.\n\ny=1 is freeway 1.\n\nAt τ=0, freeway 1: since τ=0, not in 16-19, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6 is unsafe at τ=0, but I'm not on it.\n\nI need to move step by step.\n\nAt τ=0, I am at y=0.\n\nI choose action a_{24}, which determines y_{25} = y_{24} + Δy.\n\ny_{t+1} depends on a_t.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position (0, y_t), and I choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at (0, y_{t+1}).\n\nCollision at turn t if I am on freeway y_t, and for that freeway, at turn t, 0 is in some car span.\n\nAt turn t, I am on freeway k if y_t = k, for k=1 to 8.\n\nIf y_t not in 1-8, no collision.\n\nNow, at turn t=24, τ=0, y=0, which is not a freeway, so no collision possible, regardless of cars.\n\nThen I choose a_{24}, which sets y_{25}.\n\nSimilarly, at turn t, if y_t = k for k=1-8, then I need that at turn t, for freeway k, 0 not covered.\n\nBack to path.\n\nI need to reach y=9, so I must have a sequence where I end at y=9.\n\nMinimal H: since I start at y=0, end at y=9, and must increase by 9, but I can stay or move down, so minimal H is 9, if I go up every turn.\n\nBut I need to avoid collisions on the way.\n\nSo let's see if I can go directly up in 9 turns.\n\nFrom y=0 to y=9 in 9 steps: turns t=24 to 32, y from 0 to 9.\n\ny_t at turn t:\n\nt=24: y=0\n\nAfter a_{24}, y_{25} = y_{24} + Δy_{24}\n\nSet τ = t - 24, so τ=0: t=24, y=0\n\nτ=1: t=25, y = y_{25} = 0 + Δy_{24}\n\netc.\n\ny_τ at time τ.\n\ny_0 = 0\n\nThen y_1 = y_0 + a_0, where a_0 is action at τ=0, etc.\n\nActions: U: +1, D: -1, S:0\n\ny_{τ} for τ=0,1,2,...\n\ny_0 = 0\n\ny_1 = y_0 + Δa_0\n\n...\n\ny_H = 9, for some H.\n\nAt time τ, position y_τ.\n\nIf y_τ = k for k=1-8, then need that at time τ, freeway k is safe.\n\nNow, for direct up: all actions U, so y_τ = τ for τ from 0 to 9, but y_0=0, y_1=1, y_2=2, ..., y_9=9.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0, not freeway, safe.\n\nAt τ=1, y=1, freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1 at τ=1: since unsafe only at τ=16-19, τ=1<16, safe.\n\nAt τ=2, y=2, freeway 2, which is always safe.\n\nτ=3, y=3, freeway 3, always safe.\n\nτ=4, y=4, freeway 4, safe.\n\nτ=5, y=5, freeway 5, safe.\n\nτ=6, y=6, freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6 at τ=6: from above, unsafe only at τ=0, but τ=6>0, so safe.\n\nτ=7, y=7, freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 at τ=7: unsafe at τ=0,1,8,9. τ=7 not in, so safe.\n\nτ=8, y=8, freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 at τ=8: unsafe at τ=8, since τ=8 is unsafe for freeway 7 and 8.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe at τ=8.\n\nAt τ=8, y=8, freeway 8, and τ=8 is unsafe, so collision.\n\nProblem at τ=8.\n\ny_8=8, but freeway 8 unsafe at τ=8.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=9, y=9, but y=9 is not freeway, so no collision, but y_9=9 is the goal.\n\nIn the sequence, at τ=8, t=24+8=32, y=8, which is freeway, and unsafe.\n\nSo collision if I go directly.\n\nTherefore, I cannot go directly up because at turn t=24+8=32, I am on y=8, and freeway 8 is occupied at that turn.\n\nSimilarly, if I arrive earlier or later.\n\nIn direct up, I am at y=8 at τ=8.\n\nBut τ=8 is unsafe for y=8.\n\nNow, for y=7, at τ=7, it was safe, as above.\n\nBut y=8 at τ=8 unsafe.\n\nI could stay or move down to avoid being on y=8 at τ=8.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal H might be more than 9.\n\nI need to find a path where I am not on unsafe freeways at unsafe times.\n\nList the unsafe times for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): unsafe at τ=16,17,18,19\n\nFreeway 2 (y=2): always safe\n\nFreeway 3 (y=3): always safe\n\nFreeway 4 (y=4): always safe\n\nFreeway 5 (y=5): always safe\n\nFreeway 6 (y=6): unsafe at τ=0, safe for τ≥1\n\nFreeway 7 (y=7): unsafe at τ=0,1,8,9\n\nFreeway 8 (y=8): unsafe at τ=0,1,8,9\n\nNow, I start at y=0, τ=0.\n\nAt τ=0, I must choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf I choose U, I go to y=1 at τ=1? Let's see the timing.\n\nAt τ=0, I am at y=0, choose a_0, then y_1 = y_0 + Δa_0.\n\nAt turn τ, I am at y_τ.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt τ=0, y=0, not freeway, safe.\n\nI choose a_0: if a_0 = U, then y_1 = 1\n\nIf a_0 = S, y_1 = 0\n\nIf a_0 = D, y_1 = -1, but y must be in [0,9], so y_1 = max(0, min(9, y_0 + Δy)), but since y_0=0, if D, y_1 = max(0, 0-1) = max(0,-1)=0, so y_1=0 if D.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, if U, y=9.\n\nSo y stays within 0 to 9.\n\nNow, if I choose a_0 = U at τ=0, then y_1 =1.\n\nAt τ=1, I am at y=1, freeway 1.\n\nAt time τ=1, freeway 1 is safe, as τ=1<16.\n\nIf I choose S or D at τ=0, I stay at y=0 or go to y=0, so y_1=0.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nNow, for freeway 6, unsafe at τ=0, but at τ=0, if I were on y=6, it would be unsafe, but I'm at y=0.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=0, freeway 7 and 8 are unsafe, but I'm not on them.\n\nThe issue is when I am on them at unsafe times.\n\nIn the direct path, at τ=8, I am on y=8, which is unsafe.\n\nTo avoid that, I can either not be on y=8 at τ=8, or delay or advance my arrival.\n\nSince freeway 8 is unsafe at τ=8 and 9, I need to be on y=8 at some other time.\n\nSimilarly for y=7, unsafe at τ=0,1,8,9, so safe only at τ=2,3,4,5,6,7? τ=2 to7 safe for y=7.\n\nτ=2,3,4,5,6,7 safe for y=7.\n\nSimilarly for y=8, same unsafe times, safe at τ=2,3,4,5,6,7? τ=2 to7.\n\nτ=0,1,8,9 unsafe, so safe at τ=2,3,4,5,6,7.\n\nτ=7 is safe? For y=7, τ=7 safe, yes.\n\ny=8, τ=7 safe.\n\nBut at τ=8 and9 unsafe.\n\nNow, also freeway 6 is safe for τ≥1.\n\nFreeway 1 unsafe only late, τ=16-19, which is far, so for early times, safe.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nThe critical part is around y=6,7,8 at times τ=0 to9 or so.\n\nSince I need to be on y=7 and y=8 at safe times, which are τ=2 to7.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 is safe for τ≥1.\n\nNow, for minimal H, I want to go up as fast as possible.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=0.\n\nI can go up immediately.\n\na_0 = U: then at τ=1, y=1, which is safe.\n\nThen a_1 = U: at τ=2, y=2, safe.\n\na_2 = U: τ=3, y=3, safe.\n\na_3 = U: τ=4, y=4, safe.\n\na_4 = U: τ=5, y=5, safe.\n\na_5 = U: τ=6, y=6.\n\nNow at τ=6, y=6, freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6 safe for τ≥1, so τ=6 safe.\n\nNow a_6: if U, go to y=7 at τ=7.\n\nAt τ=7, y=7, freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 safe at τ=7, since τ=7 not unsafe (unsafe at 0,1,8,9).\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen a_7: if U, go to y=8 at τ=8.\n\nBut at τ=8, y=8, freeway 8 unsafe.\n\nCollision.\n\nIf I do S at τ=7, stay at y=7.\n\nAt τ=7, y=7, safe.\n\nThen at τ=8, if I stay, y=7 still.\n\nAt τ=8, y=7, freeway 7.\n\nBut freeway 7 unsafe at τ=8, so if I stay at y=7 at τ=8, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I move down, but y=7 at τ=8 is unsafe.\n\nSo I need to not be on y=7 at τ=8.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nSo at τ=8, I should not be on y=7 or y=8, since both unsafe.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 both unsafe at τ=8.\n\ny=6 at τ=8: freeway 6 safe for τ≥1, so safe.\n\ny=5, etc., safe.\n\nSo at τ=8, I need to be on y≤6 or y=9, but y=9 not yet.\n\ny=6 is safe.\n\nIn the sequence, at τ=6, I am at y=6.\n\nIf I go up to y=7 at τ=7, which is safe.\n\nThen at τ=7, y=7.\n\nNow, instead of going to y=8, I could stay or go down.\n\nBut if I go down to y=6 at τ=8.\n\na_7 = D: then y_8 = y_7 + (-1) = 7 -1 =6.\n\nAt τ=8, y=6, freeway 6, which is safe since τ=8≥1.\n\nThen at τ=8, y=6, safe.\n\nThen I need to go to y=9 from here.\n\nBut y=6, I need to go up to y=7,8,9.\n\nBut freeway 7 and 8 are unsafe at τ=8 and τ=9.\n\nAt τ=8, I am at y=6.\n\nIf I go up, a_8 = U, then y_9 =7.\n\nAt τ=9, y=7, freeway 7, but τ=9 unsafe, collision.\n\nIf I stay, a_8 = S, y_9 =6, still y=6, then at τ=9, y=6, safe, but not progress.\n\nThen later I need to go up.\n\nBut freeway 7 and 8 unsafe until τ=10? τ=10 safe.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 unsafe at τ=0,1,8,9, so safe at τ=10 and above.\n\nτ=10 safe.\n\nSo at τ=8, y=6, safe.\n\nI can wait until τ=10 to go up.\n\nFor example, at τ=8, I can stay or move.\n\nIf I go up at τ=8 to y=7, but at τ=9, y=7, which is unsafe at τ=9.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo better to stay at y=6 for a while.\n\nAt τ=8, y=6.\n\nSet a_8 = S, then y_9 =6 (stay).\n\nAt τ=9, y=6, freeway 6, safe.\n\nNow τ=9, freeway 7 and 8 still unsafe.\n\nThen at τ=9, I can choose a_9.\n\nIf I go up, a_9 = U, then y_10 =7.\n\nAt τ=10, y=7, freeway 7.\n\nτ=10, safe for y=7? Freeway 7 unsafe at τ=0,1,8,9, so τ=10>9, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nThen at τ=10, y=7, safe.\n\nThen I can go up to y=8 at τ=11.\n\na_10 = U, y_11 =8.\n\nAt τ=11, y=8, freeway 8.\n\nτ=11, safe? Unsafe at τ=0,1,8,9, so τ=11>9, safe.\n\nThen go to y=9 at τ=12.\n\na_11 = U, y_12 =9.\n\nAt τ=12, y=9, not freeway, safe, and goal.\n\nNow, let's see the sequence from start.\n\nτ=0: y=0, choose a_0 = U (go up), y_1 =1\n\nτ=1: y=1, freeway 1, safe (τ=1<16), choose a_1 = U, y_2=2\n\nτ=2: y=2, freeway 2, safe, choose a_2 = U, y_3=3\n\nτ=3: y=3, freeway 3, safe, a_3 = U, y_4=4\n\nτ=4: y=4, freeway 4, safe, a_4 = U, y_5=5\n\nτ=5: y=5, freeway 5, safe, a_5 = U, y_6=6\n\nτ=6: y=6, freeway 6, safe (τ=6>0), choose a_6 = U, y_7=7\n\nτ=7: y=7, freeway 7, safe (τ=7 not 0,1,8,9), choose a_7? Now, if I go up, to y=8 at τ=8, unsafe.\n\nSo instead, choose a_7 = D? Or S.\n\nIf I choose a_7 = D, then y_8 =7-1=6\n\nAt τ=8: y=6, freeway 6, safe (τ=8>0)\n\nThen at τ=8, choose a_8. I can choose S or U.\n\nBut if U, go to y=7 at τ=9.\n\nAt τ=9: y=7, freeway 7, unsafe (τ=9 unsafe)\n\nCollision.\n\nNot good.\n\nAfter y_7=7 at τ=7, instead of going down, I can stay.\n\na_7 = S, then y_8 =7\n\nBut at τ=8, y=7, freeway 7, unsafe. Collision.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo better to go down to y=6 at τ=8.\n\nBut then at τ=8, y=6, safe.\n\nThen I need to wait until τ=10 to go to y=7.\n\nAt τ=8, y=6, choose a_8 = S, then y_9 =6\n\nAt τ=9, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at τ=9, choose a_9. If U, y_10=7\n\nAt τ=10, y=7, safe (τ=10 not unsafe)\n\nThen a_10 = U, y_11=8\n\nAt τ=11, y=8, safe (τ=11 not unsafe)\n\nThen a_11 = U, y_12=9\n\nAt τ=12, y=9, goal.\n\nNow, back to τ=6: I went to y=7 at τ=7.\n\nBut at τ=7, I could go to y=6 immediately? No.\n\nSequence so far:\n\nτ=0: start y=0, a_0=U, y1=1\n\nτ=1: y=1, a1=U, y2=2\n\nτ=2: y=2, a2=U, y3=3\n\nτ=3: y=3, a3=U, y4=4\n\nτ=4: y=4, a4=U, y5=5\n\nτ=5: y=5, a5=U, y6=6\n\nτ=6: y=6, a6=U, y7=7  (since safe at τ=7)\n\nτ=7: y=7, now a7 must not stay or go up, because if stay, y8=7, unsafe at τ=8; if up, y8=8, unsafe.\n\nSo only choice is go down: a7=D, then y8=6\n\nτ=8: y=6, safe, a8=S, y9=6 (wait)\n\nτ=9: y=6, safe, a9=U, y10=7\n\nτ=10: y=7, safe, a10=U, y11=8\n\nτ=11: y=8, safe, a11=U, y12=9\n\nτ=12: y=9, done.\n\nH = number of actions? From τ=0 to τ=11, actions at τ=0 to 11, 12 actions, H=12.\n\ny from 0 to 12, but y12=9.\n\nTurns: from turn t1=24 to turn t1 + H -1, but let's see.\n\nThe sequence of actions: from turn t=24 to t=24 + H -1, and after H actions, at turn t=24 + H, y=9.\n\nDefine.\n\nI am at turn T, position y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, y_{T+1} = y_T + Δa_T.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T.\n\nThe goal is to have y_T =9 for some T.\n\nMinimal T - 24.\n\nIn terms of τ, y_τ at time τ.\n\nSet τ such that at τ=0, t=24, y=0.\n\nI want y_τ =9 for some τ.\n\nThe actions are chosen at each τ from 0 to τ-1, I think.\n\nStart: τ=0, y=0\n\nAfter k actions, at τ=k, y_k.\n\nI want y_k =9 for some k.\n\nk is the number of turns from start.\n\nAt time τ, after τ actions? Let's clarify.\n\nAt time τ=0 (turn 24), before any action, y=0.\n\nI choose action a_0, then at τ=1 (turn 25), y=y_1.\n\nSimilarly, at τ, I choose a_τ, then y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δa_τ.\n\nThe position at time τ is y_τ.\n\nAt time τ, I am at y_τ, and I choose a_τ to go to y_{τ+1}.\n\nCollision at time τ if y_τ in 1-8 and freeway unsafe at τ.\n\nIn the sequence above, at τ=0, y=0, safe, no action? Action is chosen at τ.\n\nAt each turn τ, I am at y_τ, and I choose a_τ.\n\nFor τ from 0 to m, I choose a_τ, and at τ=m, y_m=9.\n\ny_m=9 at time τ=m.\n\nIn the path above:\n\nAt τ=0: y=0, choose a_0=U\n\nAt τ=1: y=1, choose a_1=U\n\n...\n\nAt τ=6: y=6, choose a_6=U\n\nAt τ=7: y=7, choose a_7=D\n\nAt τ=8: y=6, choose a_8=S\n\nAt τ=9: y=6, choose a_9=U\n\nAt τ=10: y=7, choose a_10=U\n\nAt τ=11: y=8, choose a_11=U\n\nAt τ=12: y=9, done.\n\nSo at τ=12, y=9.\n\nI used 12 actions: from a_0 to a_11.\n\nH is the number of turns, I think the number of actions to reach.\n\nIn the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" such that after H actions, at turn t1 + H, position is (0,9).\n\nAfter H actions, turn is t1 + H.\n\nStart at turn t1, position given.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, at turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1}\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + H-1}, at turn t1 + H, position y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nIn terms of τ: τ from 0 to H, at τ=H, y_H=9.\n\nActions from τ=0 to τ=H-1.\n\nIn above, y_12=9, so H=12, actions from τ=0 to 11.\n\nBut can I do with less?\n\nH=12 means 12 turns of actions.\n\nMinimal possible is 9, but we couldn't do because of the unsafe at τ=8.\n\nBut perhaps I can go faster by not going to y=7 early.\n\nFor example, at τ=5, y=5.\n\nInstead of going to y=6 at τ=6, I could stay or something.\n\nBut I need to go up.\n\nSince freeways 2-5 are always safe, I can be on them any time, but y=6,7,8 have restrictions.\n\nNow, y=6 is safe after τ=0, so for τ≥1.\n\ny=7 and 8 safe only at τ=2 to7, except τ=0,1,8,9 unsafe.\n\nτ=2,3,4,5,6,7 safe for y=7 and y=8.\n\nBut at τ=7, if I am on y=7, I can go to y=8 at τ=8, but τ=8 unsafe for y=8.\n\nI cannot be on y=8 at τ=8.\n\nSimilarly, I need to be on y=8 at τ≤7 or τ≥10.\n\nτ=7 is safe for y=8.\n\nAt τ=7, y=8 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=6, y=8 safe, etc.\n\nIn the direct path, I was at y=7 at τ=7, but if I can be at y=8 at τ=7, then I can go to y=9 at τ=8.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at τ=7, I need to have arrived earlier.\n\nFor example, start and go up faster? But I start from y=0, each up move takes one turn, so to be at y=8 at τ=7, I need to go up 8 times in 7 turns, which requires moving up every turn from τ=0 to τ=6, but y from 0 to 8 in 8 steps? From τ=0 y=0 to τ=7 y=8: that's 8 moves? Positions.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0\n\nAfter 1 up, τ=1, y=1\n\n...\n\nAfter k up moves, at τ=k, y=k.\n\nTo be at y=8 at τ=7: that would require 8 up moves in 7 steps? Impossible because from y=0, after 7 actions, y_7 ≤7 if all up, or less.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0\n\nAfter action a_0 to a_6 (7 actions), at τ=7, y_7.\n\nIf all U, y_7=7.\n\nCannot be at y=8 at τ=7.\n\nEarliest at y=8 is τ=8, with y_0=0, a_0 to a_7 all U, y_8=8.\n\nBut at τ=8, y=8 unsafe.\n\nSo I cannot be at y=8 before τ=8, and at τ=8 and 9 unsafe, so earliest safe to be at y=8 is τ=10.\n\nSimilarly, for y=7, I can be at τ=2 to7.\n\nBut to minimize time, I should go up as much as possible until I need to avoid.\n\nIn the previous path, I went to y=7 at τ=7, then down to y=6 at τ=8, then stayed, then up to y=7 at τ=10, etc., taking 12 turns.\n\nBut at τ=7, I went to y=7, which is safe, but then I had to go down because I couldn't proceed.\n\nI could delay going to y=6 and y=7.\n\nFor example, stay at lower levels longer.\n\nBut that might take more time.\n\nSince freeways 2-5 are safe, I can stay there, but I need to go up eventually.\n\nAnother idea: go directly to y=5, which is safe, and stay there until it's safe to go to y=6,7,8.\n\ny=6 is safe after τ=0, so I can go to y=6 at any τ≥1.\n\nBut y=7 and 8 need safe times.\n\nThe unsafe period for y=7 and 8 is τ=8 and 9, so I need to be on y=7 or 8 before τ=8 or after τ=9.\n\nSpecifically, to reach y=9, I need to pass through y=7 and y=8.\n\nI can be on y=7 at τ=2 to7, safe.\n\nThen from y=7, go to y=8 at some τ when safe.\n\nFor example, at τ=7, y=7, I can go to y=8 at τ=8, but τ=8 unsafe for y=8.\n\nNot possible.\n\nGo to y=8 at τ=7.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at τ=7, impossible from start.\n\nLatest I can be on y=7 is τ=7, since after that unsafe until τ=10.\n\nτ=10 safe for y=7.\n\nBut if I go to y=7 at τ=7, I can only go to y=8 at τ=8 or later, but τ=8 and9 unsafe, so I have to go down or stay, but staying or moving to y=8 at τ=8 causes collision.\n\nSo I must leave y=7 before τ=8.\n\nSimilarly, I cannot be on y=7 at τ=8 or9.\n\nIn the safe window τ=2 to7, I can be on y=7.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nTo minimize time, I should be on y=7 as early as possible in safe window, say τ=2.\n\nBut to be at y=7 at τ=2, I need to go from y=0 to y=7 in 2 steps? Impossible, min 7 steps.\n\nAt τ=0 y=0, τ=1 y=1, τ=2 y=2, etc., at τ=7 y=7.\n\nSo I can be at y=7 only at τ=7 in the early safe window.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at τ=8, but unsafe.\n\nSo no way to be on y=7 or 8 before τ=10 except at τ=7 for y=7.\n\nAt τ=7, y=7 is possible and safe.\n\nBut from there, I cannot go to y=8 directly because next step would be τ=8, y=8 unsafe.\n\nSo I have to retreat to a safe row, like y=6, at τ=8.\n\nThen wait until τ=10 to go to y=7.\n\nThen to y=8 at τ=11, y=9 at τ=12.\n\nSo it seems necessary to take that detour.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=8 later directly.\n\nBut I have to go through y=7 first.\n\nAnother path: suppose I go up to y=5 quickly.\n\ny=5 can be reached at τ=5.\n\nThen stay at y=5 for a few turns.\n\nThen go to y=6 at some point.\n\ny=6 safe after τ=0, so I can go at τ=6, for example.\n\nThen to y=7.\n\nBut if I go to y=7 at τ=7, same as before.\n\nIf I go to y=7 later, at τ=10.\n\nBut to go to y=7 at τ=10, I need to be at y=6 at τ=9 or something.\n\nBut y=6 is safe, so I can go to y=6 at τ=6, then stay until τ=9, then go to y=7 at τ=10.\n\nBut let's see the time.\n\nStart: τ=0, y=0, a0=U, y1=1\n\nτ=1, y=1, a1=U, y2=2\n\nτ=2, y=2, a2=U, y3=3\n\nτ=3, y=3, a3=U, y4=4\n\nτ=4, y=4, a4=U, y5=5\n\nNow at τ=5, y=5, I can choose to stay.\n\na5=S, then y6=5\n\nτ=6, y=5, a6=S, y7=5? Or go up.\n\nIf I go up at τ=6 to y=6.\n\na6=U, y7=6\n\nBut at τ=7, y=6.\n\nThen I can go to y=7 at τ=8? a7=U, y8=7\n\nBut at τ=8, y=7, freeway 7, unsafe (τ=8 unsafe)\n\nCollision.\n\nIf at τ=6, y=5, I stay: a6=S, y7=5\n\nτ=7, y=5, safe, then a7=U, y8=6\n\nτ=8, y=6, safe (freeway 6)\n\nThen at τ=8, I can go to y=7? a8=U, y9=7\n\nBut at τ=9, y=7, freeway 7, unsafe (τ=9 unsafe)\n\nCollision.\n\nSo I need to wait until τ=10 to go to y=7.\n\nAt τ=8, y=6, I must not go up immediately.\n\nSet a8=S, y9=6\n\nτ=9, y=6, safe\n\na9=U, y10=7\n\nτ=10, y=7, safe\n\na10=U, y11=8\n\nτ=11, y=8, safe\n\na11=U, y12=9\n\nSame as before, H=12.\n\nIf I go to y=6 earlier.\n\nFor example, at τ=1, y=1, I could go to y=2, etc., but same.\n\nSuppose I stay at y=0 for one turn.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0, choose a0=S, then y1=0\n\nτ=1, y=0, not freeway, safe, then a1=U, y2=1\n\nThen continue: a2=U, y3=2, a3=U, y4=3, a4=U, y5=4, a5=U, y6=5, a6=U, y7=6\n\nτ=7, y=6, same as before.\n\nThen a7=U, y8=7? But at τ=8, y=7 unsafe? At τ=7, y=6, a7=U, then at τ=8, y=7.\n\nBut τ=8 unsafe for y=7.\n\nIf at τ=7, I do not go up, a7=S, y8=6\n\nThen same as before, need to wait.\n\nNo savings.\n\nPerhaps I can go down to y=5 or something, but that seems worse.\n\nSo probably the minimal H is 12.\n\nBut earlier at freeway 1, there is unsafe at τ=16-19, but since we reach by τ=12, it's fine, no issue.\n\nIn the sequence, at τ=7, I went to y=7, which is safe, then down to y=6 at τ=8.\n\nBut is there a way to go directly to y=8 at a safe time?\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=8 at τ=10.\n\nThen I need to get to y=8 by τ=10.\n\nFrom start, min 8 up moves, at τ=8 y=8, but unsafe, so not possible before τ=10.\n\nAt τ=10, y=8 is safe.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at τ=10, I need 8 up moves in 10 turns, so I can have some stays or downs, but that would take more turns, not less.\n\nFor example, at τ=10, y=8, then to y=9 at τ=11.\n\nBut compared to previous at τ=12 y=9, here τ=11 y=9? If y=8 at τ=10, a10=U, y11=9.\n\nBut to have y=8 at τ=10, I need to have taken actions such that after 10 steps, y=8.\n\nSince I start y=0, I need net +8 in y, so at least 8 up moves, so min τ=8 for y=8, but at τ=8 unsafe, so I must delay.\n\nFor example, I can reach y=8 at τ=10 by having two extra stays or downs.\n\nBut that would make H larger, since I reach y=9 later.\n\nFor example, suppose I go up to y=5 at τ=5, then stay or something.\n\nAt τ=5, y=5, I stay two times: a5=S, y6=5; a6=S, y7=5; then a7=U, y8=6; a8=U, y9=7; but at τ=9, y=7 unsafe? y9=7 at τ=9, unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\na7=U, y8=6; then at τ=8, y=6, a8=U, y9=7, unsafe at τ=9.\n\nStill problem.\n\nTo avoid, I need to be at y=6 at τ=9, then go to y=7 at τ=10.\n\nFor example: at τ=8, y=6, a8=S, y9=6\n\nτ=9, y=6, a9=U, y10=7\n\nThen a10=U, y11=8, a11=U, y12=9, same as before.\n\nIf I want y=8 at τ=10, I could have: for example, at some point move down to waste time, but that increases H.\n\nSuppose at τ=4, y=4, I move down: a4=D, y5=3? But y=3 safe, then I need to go up again.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo minimal H is 12.\n\nBut in the sequence I have, it works.\n\nNow, back to the beginning, freeway 6 at τ=0 unsafe, but in my path I am not on it at τ=0.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nNow, the actions: from turn t1=24.\n\nSo actions at turn 24 to 35, since τ=0 to 11, 12 actions, turn 24 to 35, at turn 36, y=9.\n\nt1=24, actions a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1}, after which at turn t1 + H, y=9.\n\nSo with H=12, actions from turn 24 to 24+11=35, at turn 36, y=9.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 24: a_{24} = U  (since a0=U)\n\nTurn 25: a_{25} = U\n\nTurn 26: a_{26} = U\n\nTurn 27: a_{27} = U\n\nTurn 28: a_{28} = U\n\nTurn 29: a_{29} = U\n\nTurn 30: a_{30} = U  (to y=7 at turn 31)\n\nAt turn 30: τ=6, y=6, choose a=U, so at turn 31, y=7\n\nTurn 31: τ=7, y=7, choose a=D, so down\n\nThen turn 32: τ=8, y=6, choose a=S, stay\n\nTurn 33: τ=9, y=6, choose a=U, up\n\nTurn 34: τ=10, y=7, choose a=U, up\n\nTurn 35: τ=11, y=8, choose a=U, up\n\nAt turn 36, y=9.\n\nNow, in the answer, I need to list the actions for turns starting from t1=24.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 31, I chose D, but is that necessary? In this case, I did.\n\nBut let me confirm the safety.\n\nAt each turn:\n\nTurn 24 (τ=0): y=0, not freeway, safe.\n\nAction: U\n\nTurn 25 (τ=1): y=1, freeway 1. τ=1, which is before 16, safe. Action: U\n\nTurn 26 (τ=2): y=2, freeway 2, always safe. Action: U\n\nTurn 27 (τ=3): y=3, freeway 3, safe. Action: U\n\nTurn 28 (τ=4): y=4, freeway 4, safe. Action: U\n\nTurn 29 (τ=5): y=5, freeway 5, safe. Action: U\n\nTurn 30 (τ=6): y=6, freeway 6. τ=6>0, safe. Action: U\n\nTurn 31 (τ=7): y=7, freeway 7. τ=7 not unsafe (0,1,8,9), so safe. Action: D (down)\n\nNow, action D, so y_{32} = y_{31} + (-1) = 7 -1 =6\n\nTurn 32 (τ=8): y=6, freeway 6. τ=8>0, safe. Action: S (stay)\n\ny_{33} =6 +0=6\n\nTurn 33 (τ=9): y=6, freeway 6, safe. Action: U\n\ny_{34} =6+1=7\n\nTurn 34 (τ=10): y=7, freeway 7. τ=10 not unsafe, safe. Action: U\n\ny_{35} =7+1=8\n\nTurn 35 (τ=11): y=8, freeway 8. τ=11 not unsafe, safe. Action: U\n\ny_{36} =8+1=9\n\nAt turn 36, y=9, goal.\n\nH=12 actions.\n\nBut is there a way with H=11?\n\nSuppose I can reach earlier.\n\nFor example, if I go to y=7 at τ=7, but instead of going down, can I go to y=8 at τ=7? But I can't, because from y=7, to go to y=8 takes one action, to τ=8.\n\nUnless I am at y=7 earlier, but I can't.\n\nAt τ=6, y=6, if I go directly to y=8? No, only one step at a time.\n\nNot possible.\n\nAt τ=7, y=7, if I could skip y=8, but no.\n\nSo I think 12 is minimal.\n\nAnother idea: since freeway 6 is safe after τ=0, and I go through it at τ=6, which is fine.\n\nBut at τ=8 and 9, I was at y=6, which is safe.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=7 at τ=6? But from y=5 at τ=5, go U to y=6 at τ=6, then to y=7 at τ=7, same as before.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nNow, about the car on freeway 6 at τ=0: head 0, tail -11, so at τ=0, it covers x=0, but since I am not on it, ok.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSo the sequence should be:\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: D\n\nTurn 32: S\n\nTurn 33: U\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut let me write in the box.\n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nt from 0 to H-1.\n\nt1=24.\n\nSo a_{24}, a_{25}, ..., a_{24 + H-1}\n\nWith H=12.\n\nSo for t=0 to 11: a_{24+0} to a_{24+11}\n\nActions:\n\na_{24} = U\n\na_{25} = U\n\na_{26} = U\n\na_{27} = U\n\na_{28} = U\n\na_{29} = U\n\na_{30} = U\n\na_{31} = D\n\na_{32} = S\n\na_{33} = U\n\na_{34} = U\n\na_{35} = U\n\nNow, in the answer, it should be listed.\n\nAlso, I think that's it.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 31, I go down to y=6, but y=6 is freeway, and at τ=7, I was at y=7, then down to y=6 at τ=8.\n\nBut y=6 is safe at that time.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid going down by timing differently.\n\nFor example, if I go to y=6 later.\n\nBut I went at τ=6, which is fine.\n\nSuppose I stay at y=5 until τ=7.\n\nAt τ=5, y=5, I stay: a5=S, y6=5\n\na6=S, y7=5\n\nThen at τ=7, y=5, a7=U, y8=6\n\nNow τ=8, y=6, safe.\n\nBut then I need to go to y=7 at τ=10? a8=U, y9=7, but at τ=9, y=7 unsafe.\n\na8=S, y9=6\n\na9=U, y10=7\n\na10=U, y11=8\n\na11=U, y12=9\n\nSame, but I started later: from τ=5 to τ=7, I stayed two turns, so I reach y=9 at τ=12 still, but I wasted two turns, so the actions are more? No.\n\nIn this case: actions from τ=0 to 11, but at τ=5 and τ=6, I did S, so y at τ=7 is 5, then up to y=6 at τ=8, etc., to y=9 at τ=12, same H=12.\n\nBut I have two S actions, whereas in the first sequence, I have one D and one S, but still 12 actions.\n\nIn terms of number, same.\n\nBut in the first sequence, I have a down move, which might not be desirable, but it works.\n\nIn the first sequence, at turn 31 (τ=7), I go down, but I don't have to, I could stay or something, but staying causes collision later.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 12.\n\nSo the answer should be the sequence as above.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 24\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the sequence of actions must account for the unsafe times on certain freeways. The unsafe times for each freeway, relative to \\(\\tau = T - 24\\) (where \\(\\tau = 0\\) is turn 24), are:\n\n- Freeway 1 (\\(y = 1\\)): Unsafe at \\(\\tau = 16, 17, 18, 19\\)\n- Freeway 6 (\\(y = 6\\)): Unsafe at \\(\\tau = 0\\), safe for \\(\\tau \\geq 1\\)\n- Freeway 7 (\\(y = 7\\)): Unsafe at \\(\\tau = 0, 1, 8, 9\\)\n- Freeway 8 (\\(y = 8\\)): Unsafe at \\(\\tau = 0, 1, 8, 9\\)\n- Freeways 2, 3, 4, and 5 (\\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5\\)): Always safe\n\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\(y = 9\\) is 12, with actions from turn 24 to turn 35. At turn 36, \\(y = 9\\) is achieved.\n\nThe sequence avoids collisions as follows:\n- At turn 31 (\\(\\tau = 7\\)), \\(y = 7\\) is safe for freeway 7, but moving up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 32 (\\(\\tau = 8\\)) would be unsafe. Therefore, move down to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 32.\n- At turn 32 (\\(\\tau = 8\\)), \\(y = 6\\) is safe for freeway 6.\n- Stay at \\(y = 6\\) for turn 33 (\\(\\tau = 9\\)) to avoid unsafe \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\).\n- Proceed upward from turn 34 (\\(\\tau = 10\\)), when freeways 7 and 8 are safe again.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n- Turn 24: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 25)\n- Turn 25: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 26)\n- Turn 26: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 27)\n- Turn 27: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 28)\n- Turn 28: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 29)\n- Turn 29: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 30)\n- Turn 30: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 31)\n- Turn 31: \\(D\\) (move down to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 32)\n- Turn 32: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 6\\) at turn 33)\n- Turn 33: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 34)\n- Turn 34: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 35)\n- Turn 35: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 36)\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions and reaches \\(y = 9\\) in 12 turns.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 24: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 25: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 26: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 27: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 28: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 29: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 30: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 31: \\, D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 32: \\, S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 33: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 34: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 35: \\, U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 2) on turn t_1 = 26. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-coordinate by +1, -1, or 0 respectively, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move on specific freeways, and for each freeway, there are cars with positions that change over time. Collision happens only if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is within the car's span at that turn.\n\nThe key point is that when the player moves to a new y, they are not on that new y until the next turn. So if they move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T they are still on y, and at turn T+1 they are on y+1. Therefore, they only check for collision on the freeway they are currently on at each turn.\n\nNow, I need to find a sequence of actions from turn 26 onwards to reach y=9 as quickly as possible, avoiding collisions.\n\nFirst, let's list the car states at turn t_1=26.\n\nFor each freeway k from 1 to 8:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car: head h=-42, tail τ=-53, direction right, speed s=3. Since direction is right, the span at time T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] because for right-moving, span is [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] where ΔT = T - t_1.\n\nFrom the update rule:\n\n- Left-moving: span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\n- Right-moving: span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (-42, -53, right, 3). But it says head h and tail τ. For right-moving, it should be that head is greater than tail? Let me check the notation.\n\nIn the car update, it says: for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] and then span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]. But in the table, for freeway 1, it's (-42, -53, right, 3). -42 > -53, so h = -42, τ = -53? But τ should be tail, which is left end, so for right-moving, tail should be smaller.\n\nIn the span definition: for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] meaning from τ to h, with τ < h. Here, τ=-53, h=-42, since -53 < -42, so τ=-53, h=-42, so the car is from -53 to -42, length 11, moving right at speed 3.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 1: car: τ=-53, h=-42, d=right, s=3. So at time T, span = [-53 + 3*(T-26), -42 + 3*(T-26)]\n\nCollision if 0 is in this span at turn T when player is on freeway 1.\n\nBut player starts on y=2, not on freeway 1, but we need to consider when player might be on freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (-48, -59, right, 12). τ=-59, h=-48? -59 < -48, so τ=-59, h=-48, d=right, s=12. Span at T: [-59 + 12*(T-26), -48 + 12*(T-26)]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? (-48, -59, right, 12) — probably a typo, or multiple cars? No, it says \"Cars\" but only one tuple, so I think it's one car per entry, but for freeway 6 and 7,8 there are multiple.\n\nLook:\n\n| Freeway k | Cars |\n\nFor k=1,2,3,4,5: each has one car: all (-48,-59,right,12) except k=1 is (-42,-53,right,3)\n\nk=1: (-42,-53,right,3)\n\nk=2: (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nk=3: (-48,-59,right,12) — same as k=2\n\nk=4: (-48,-59,right,12) — same\n\nk=5: (-48,-59,right,12) — same\n\nk=6: two cars: (-48,-59,right,12) and (24,13,right,12)\n\nk=7: two cars: (-36,-47,right,6) and (12,1,right,6)\n\nk=8: two cars: (-36,-47,right,6) and (12,1,right,6)\n\nFor k=6,7,8, multiple cars.\n\nNow, the player is at y=2 at turn 26.\n\nI need to go to y=9, so I need to increase y by 7, from 2 to 9. Minimum moves: if I go up every turn, it takes 7 turns to reach y=9, but I might need to wait or avoid cars, so it could take more.\n\nBut y starts at 2, after one U, y=3, then 4,5,6,7,8,9: that's 7 actions, so from turn 26 to turn 32, y=9 at turn 33? Let's see the timing.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at turn t, player is at y_t, takes action a_t, then at turn t+1, position is y_{t+1}.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need y_{t_1 + H} = 9 for some H, but the sequence is from t=0 to H-1 for actions, so after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position should be 9.\n\nDefine: let t be the turn index.\n\nAt turn t_1 = 26, y = 2.\n\nAfter action a_{26}, at turn 27, y_{27} = y_{26} + Δy_{26}\n\nSimilarly, after a_{27}, y_{28} = y_{27} + Δy_{27}, and so on.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} = 9 for some H, meaning after H turns, position is 9.\n\nThe actions are from t = t_1 to t = t_1 + H - 1, so H actions over H turns, from turn t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, and position at turn t_1 + H is the result.\n\nFor example, if H=0, no actions, but y=2 ≠9, so H>0.\n\nMinimal H: if no cars, I could go U each turn: actions at t=26,27,28,29,30,31,32: 7 actions, at turn 33 y=9.\n\nBut with cars, I need to check for each turn and each y I'm on, whether there is a collision.\n\nCollision at turn T if player is on freeway y_T (which is between 1 and 8), and for some car on that freeway, 0 is within the car's span at turn T.\n\nThe span is at turn T, so for each car on freeway k, at turn T, if k = y_T, and 0 in span_k(T), then collision.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nAlso, if y_T = 0 or 9, no freeway, so no collision possible. y=0 and y=9 are safe, but we need to reach (0,9), which is y=9.\n\ny=9 is the top, no cars, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 is bottom, no cars.\n\nBut player starts at y=2, which is freeway? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=2 is freeway 2.\n\nFreeway k corresponds to y=k, I assume.\n\nIn the problem, freeways y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nSo at position y, if y between 1 and 8, it's a freeway, and we need to avoid cars on that row.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when it is safe to be on it, i.e., when 0 is not in any car's span on that row at that turn.\n\nFor a given freeway k and turn T, check if 0 is not in span for any car on k at T.\n\nSince multiple cars, need to check all.\n\nFirst, let's compute for each freeway the times when it is unsafe.\n\nLet ΔT = T - 26, so T = 26 + ΔT.\n\nFor freeway 1: one car, τ=-53, h=-42, d=right, s=3\n\nSpan at T: since right, [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT] = [-53 + 3ΔT, -42 + 3ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -53 + 3ΔT <= 0 <= -42 + 3ΔT\n\nSolve inequalities:\n\n-53 + 3ΔT <= 0 => 3ΔT <= 53 => ΔT <= 53/3 ≈ 17.666, so ΔT <= 17 since integer\n\nAnd 0 <= -42 + 3ΔT => 42 <= 3ΔT => ΔT >= 14\n\nSo for ΔT from 14 to 17 inclusive, 0 in span, so unsafe.\n\nΔT >=14 and ΔT <=17.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: one car, τ=-59, h=-48, d=right, s=12\n\nSpan: [-59 + 12ΔT, -48 + 12ΔT]\n\n0 in span: -59 + 12ΔT <= 0 <= -48 + 12ΔT\n\nFirst: -59 + 12ΔT <= 0 => 12ΔT <= 59 => ΔT <= 59/12 ≈ 4.916, so ΔT <= 4\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 + 12ΔT => 48 <= 12ΔT => ΔT >= 4\n\nSo ΔT >=4 and ΔT <=4, so only at ΔT=4, T=26+4=30.\n\nUnsafe only at T=30.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same car as freeway 2? τ=-59, h=-48, right, s=12, same as k=2.\n\nSo unsafe at ΔT=4, T=30.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same, unsafe at T=30.\n\nFreeway 5: same, unsafe at T=30.\n\nNow freeway 6: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,12) same as before, τ=-59, h=-48, s=12\n\nUnsafe when 0 in span: as above, at ΔT=4, T=30.\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,12) — head h=24, tail τ=13? But for right-moving, if τ=13, h=24, then span at T: [13 + 12ΔT, 24 + 12ΔT]\n\n0 in span: 13 + 12ΔT <= 0 <= 24 + 12ΔT\n\nBut 13 + 12ΔT <=0? Since ΔT >=0, 13 +12ΔT >=13 >0, so left end >=13>0, so 0 never <= left end, so 0 never in span. So this car never causes collision on freeway 6.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-36,-47,right,6) — τ=-47, h=-36? -47 < -36, so τ=-47, h=-36, s=6\n\nSpan: [-47 + 6ΔT, -36 + 6ΔT]  (right-moving)\n\n0 in span: -47 + 6ΔT <= 0 <= -36 + 6ΔT\n\nFirst: -47 + 6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=47 => ΔT <= 47/6 ≈7.833, so ΔT <=7\n\nSecond: 0 <= -36 + 6ΔT => 36 <= 6ΔT => ΔT >=6\n\nSo ΔT from 6 to 7 inclusive, T=32 and 33? ΔT=6, T=32; ΔT=7, T=33.\n\nT=26 + ΔT, so for ΔT=6, T=32; ΔT=7, T=33.\n\nSecond car on freeway 7: (12,1,right,6) — τ=1, h=12, s=6\n\nSpan: [1 + 6ΔT, 12 + 6ΔT]\n\n0 in span: 1 + 6ΔT <=0? 1 +6ΔT >=1>0, so never <=0, so 0 never in span. Safe.\n\nSo for freeway 7, only first car causes unsafe at T=32 and 33.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same as freeway 7, since both cars same: first car (-36,-47,right,6) unsafe at T=32,33; second car (12,1,right,6) safe always.\n\nNow, freeway 6 has one unsafe point at T=30 from first car.\n\nBut freeway 6 has two cars, but only the first one can cause issue at T=30.\n\nNow, summarize unsafe times for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1 (y=1): unsafe at ΔT=14,15,16,17 → T=40,41,42,43? ΔT=T-26, so T=26+14=40, 41,42,43.\n\nBut we are starting from T=26, and we need to go to y=9, which might not take that long, since min 7 turns to y=9, so T=33, so these late times might not be relevant if we can reach earlier.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 (y=2): unsafe only at T=30 (ΔT=4)\n\nFreeway 3 (y=3): same, unsafe at T=30\n\nFreeway 4 (y=4): unsafe at T=30\n\nFreeway 5 (y=5): unsafe at T=30\n\nFreeway 6 (y=6): unsafe at T=30 (from first car)\n\nFreeway 7 (y=7): unsafe at T=32 and 33\n\nFreeway 8 (y=8): unsafe at T=32 and 33\n\nPlayer starts at y=2 at T=26.\n\nWe need to reach y=9, so we need to pass through y=2,3,4,5,6,7,8 to 9.\n\nBut we can stay or move down, but since we need to go up, probably best to go up as much as possible, but avoid unsafe times.\n\nAt each turn, when player is on a freeway, it must be safe.\n\nPlayer at turn T is on y_T.\n\nFor example, at T=26, y=2, which is freeway 2, and T=26, is it safe?\n\nFreeway 2 unsafe only at T=30, so at T=26, ΔT=0, not unsafe, so safe.\n\nNow, we need to plan the path.\n\nI want to minimize H, so start with H=7: actions from t=26 to 32, position at t=33 is y=9.\n\nActions: all U, so y: t=26:2, a26=U, t=27:3, a27=U, t=28:4, a28=U, t=29:5, a29=U, t=30:6, a30=U, t=31:7, a31=U, t=32:8, a32=U, t=33:9.\n\nNow, check for each turn when on freeway, if collision.\n\nTurn T=26: y=2, freeway 2. Safe? As above, unsafe only at T=30, so T=26 safe.\n\nT=27: y=3, freeway 3. Unsafe only at T=30, so T=27 safe.\n\nT=28: y=4, freeway 4. Unsafe only at T=30, safe.\n\nT=29: y=5, freeway 5. Unsafe only at T=30, safe.\n\nT=30: y=6, freeway 6. Now, freeway 6 unsafe at T=30, so collision! Not safe.\n\nSo at T=30, on y=6, which is unsafe, so collision.\n\nThus, this path has collision at T=30.\n\nNeed to avoid that.\n\nOne way: at some point, stay or move down to avoid being on y=6 at T=30.\n\nSince min H=7 might not work, try H=8 or more.\n\nBut first, can we still do in 7 turns by changing actions?\n\nIn the sequence above, at T=30, y=6 is bad.\n\nSo perhaps at some earlier turn, do not move up, so that at T=30, we are not on y=6.\n\nFor example, at turn 29, instead of U, do S or D, so that at T=30, y is not 6.\n\nLet's see the positions.\n\nAt T=29, if we do S, y remains 5 (since a29=S, y30 = y29 +0 =5)\n\nOr D, y30=4.\n\nThen from there, we need to reach y=9.\n\nBut y=9 at later turn.\n\nSimilarly, if at T=28, do something else.\n\nLet me denote the turn and y.\n\nLet t be turn, y_t position at turn t.\n\nt=26: y=2\n\nWe need to choose a_t for t=26 to t=26+H-1, so that y_{26+H} =9.\n\nFor H=7, we need y_{33}=9.\n\nThe sequence above had y_t: t26:2, t27:3, t28:4, t29:5, t30:6, t31:7, t32:8, t33:9\n\nCollision at t30: y=6, freeway 6 unsafe.\n\nTo avoid, we need y_{30} not 6, or if y30=6, but it must be safe, but it's unsafe, so cannot be on 6 at t30.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6 unsafe only at t30, so other times safe.\n\nSo we need to not be on y=6 at t=30.\n\nThat means, at t=30, y30 ≠6.\n\ny30 depends on a29 and y29.\n\ny30 = y29 + Δy_{29}\n\ny29 depends on previous.\n\nSince we start from y26=2, and go up, y_t increases roughly.\n\nAt t=30, y30 must not be 6.\n\nPossible values: if y30=5, or 7, etc., but we need to see if possible.\n\nFor example, if at t=29, we are on y=5, and we do S, then y30=5.\n\nOr if on y=6 and do D, but at t=29, if we are on y=6, then y30=5 if D.\n\nBut let's see the timeline.\n\nAssume we want min H, so try to keep y increasing.\n\nBut at t=30, we cannot be on 6.\n\nSo let's say at t=30, y30 =5 or 7.\n\nIf y30=5, then we were at y29=5 and did S, or y29=6 and did D, or y29=4 and did U, etc.\n\nSimilarly for 7.\n\nNow, from start, at t=26, y=2.\n\nSuppose we go U at t=26: y27=3\n\nU at t=27: y28=4\n\nNow at t=28, we need to choose a28.\n\nIf we go U, y29=5\n\nThen at t=29, if we go U, y30=6, which is bad.\n\nSo at t=29, we must not go U if y29=5; must do S or D.\n\nIf S, y30=5\n\nIf D, y30=4\n\nThen from there, we need to go up to 9.\n\nBut y at t=30 is 5 or 4, and we need to reach 9 by t=33, which requires increasing by 4 or 5 in 3 turns, min increase 3, max 4 if all U, but y from 5 to 9 is 4 steps, need 4 actions, so from t=30 to t=33, with actions at t=30,31,32, y31, y32, y33.\n\ny33 = y30 + Δy30 + Δy31 + Δy32\n\nTo have y33=9, need Δy30 + Δy31 + Δy32 = 9 - y30\n\nIf y30=5, need sum=4, so possible with U,U,U: y31=6, y32=7, y33=8? y30=5, a30=U, y31=6, a31=U, y32=7, a32=U, y33=8, which is not 9. y33=8, need to reach 9.\n\ny33=9, so with three actions, max y33 = y30 +3.\n\nIf y30=5, y33 <=8 <9, cannot reach 9 by t=33.\n\nSimilarly, if y30=4, y33 <=7<9, worse.\n\ny30 is at t=30, y33 at t=33.\n\nWith actions at t=30,31,32, y31 = y30 + Δy30, y32 = y31 + Δy31, y33 = y32 + Δy32\n\nSo y33 = y30 + Δy30 + Δy31 + Δy32\n\nEach Δy <=1, so y33 <= y30 + 3\n\nSimilarly, min y33 = y30 -3\n\nBut we need y33=9.\n\nIf y30 <=6, then y33 <=9, but if y30=6, y33<=9, possible if all U: y33=9.\n\nIf y30=5, y33<=8<9, impossible to reach 9 at t=33.\n\nSimilarly, y30=4, y33<=7<9, impossible.\n\ny30=7, y33<=10, but y max 9, so y33<=9, if y30=7, need y33=9, so +2, possible with two U and one S, for example.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nIn the case where at t=30, we avoid y=6.\n\nBut for H=7, we need y33=9.\n\ny33 = y30 + Δy30 + Δy31 + Δy32\n\ny30 must be such that y30 + max possible <=9, min possible >=9? Since Δy can be chosen.\n\ny33 = y30 + sum of three Δy, each -1,0,1.\n\nSo y33 between y30-3 and y30+3.\n\nWe need y33=9, so y30 must be between 6 and 12, but y<=9, so y30 between 6 and 9.\n\nIf y30=6, then need sum of Δy = +3, so all three U.\n\nIf y30=7, need sum +2, e.g., U,U,S or U,D,U but net +2, etc.\n\nIf y30=8, need sum +1.\n\nIf y30=9, need sum 0, but y33=9, already there, but at t=30 y=9, then actions not needed, but we need to be at 9 at t=33, but if y30=9, then for t=30,31,32, if we do nothing, y remains 9, but at t=33 y=9, but we need to specify actions until we reach.\n\nBut y30=9 is possible only if we reached earlier, but for min H, we might reach before t=33.\n\nIn this case for H=7, we need to reach at t=33.\n\nBut with y30=6, we can have y33=9 with all U.\n\nBut earlier, if we are on y=6 at t=30, it is unsafe, so we cannot have y30=6 if we want to be safe at t=30.\n\ny30=6 at t=30, on freeway 6, unsafe.\n\nSo for y30=6, we have collision, so not possible.\n\nNow, if y30=7, then need to get to y33=9 with +2.\n\ny30=7 is freeway 7, which at t=30, is it safe?\n\nFreeway 7 unsafe at T=32 and 33, not at T=30.\n\nAt T=30, ΔT=4, for freeway 7.\n\nEarlier: freeway 7 unsafe at ΔT=6 and 7, T=32,33.\n\nAt T=30, ΔT=4, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at t=30: freeway 8 unsafe at T=32,33, safe at t=30.\n\ny=9 at t=30: not freeway, safe.\n\nBut we are at t=30, y30.\n\nBack to H=7 case.\n\nTo have y33=9, we need y30 >=6.\n\nBut y30=6 not possible because unsafe at t=30.\n\ny30=7: possible, and safe at t=30.\n\nThen need y33=9, so from y30=7, need +2 in three actions.\n\nFor example, actions: U at t=30, U at t=31, S at t=32: then y31=8, y32=8 (if S), y33=9? a32=S, y33=y32 +0=8, not 9.\n\ny31 = y30 + Δy30\n\nIf y30=7, a30=U, y31=8\n\na31=U, y32=9\n\na32=S, y33=9\n\nOr a32=U, y33=10, but y max 9, so y33=min(9, y32 + Δy), but if y32=9, Δy must be 0 or -1, so y33<=9.\n\nIn this case, if y32=9, y33=9 with S or D, but D to 8, not good.\n\nSo to have y33=9, we need y32 such that y33 = y32 + Δy32 =9, so if y32=9, Δy32=0; if y32=8, Δy32=1; etc.\n\nBut with y30=7, we can have:\n\n- a30=U, y31=8\n\n- a31=U, y32=9\n\n- a32=S, y33=9\n\ny33=9.\n\nNow, check safety.\n\nFirst, we need to reach y30=7 by t=30.\n\ny30=7 at t=30.\n\nNow, from start, t=26, y=2.\n\nWe need to go from y=2 to y=7 in 4 turns? From t=26 to t=30, with actions at t=26,27,28,29 affecting y27,y28,y29,y30.\n\ny30 = y26 + Δy26 + Δy27 + Δy28 + Δy29\n\ny26=2, so y30 = 2 + sum_{t=26 to 29} Δy_t\n\nEach Δy: -1,0,1.\n\ny30=7, so need sum of four Δy = +5.\n\nBut max each +1, so max sum +4, y30<=6.\n\n2 + 4*1 =6, cannot reach 7 in four steps from 2.\n\ny26=2, after one action, y27 <=3, after two y28<=4, after three y29<=5, after four y30<=6.\n\nSo maximum y30=6, cannot be 7.\n\nSimilarly, minimum y30=2-4= -2, but y>=0, so y30 min 0.\n\nSo y30 <=6.\n\nFor H=7 with y33=9, we need y30 between 6 and 9, but y30<=6, so y30=6 is the only possibility, but y30=6 at t=30 is unsafe, collision.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to reach y=9 at t=33 with no collision in this path.\n\nSince y30 must be 6 for y33=9, but unsafe, and cannot be higher.\n\nThus, for H=7, impossible to reach (0,9) at t=33 without collision.\n\nTherefore, minimal H must be greater than 7.\n\nNow try H=8: actions from t=26 to t=33, position at t=34 is 9.\n\nSo y_{34}=9.\n\nNow, y34 = y30 + Δy30 + Δy31 + Δy32 + Δy33\n\ny30 must be such that we can reach y34=9.\n\ny34 = y30 + sum of four Δy, so y30 +4 >= y34 >= y30 -4\n\nNeed y34=9, so y30 between 5 and 9? y30 +4 >=9 so y30>=5; y30 -4 <=9 always true since y<=9.\n\ny30 >=5.\n\nAlso, at t=30, if y30=6, it must be safe, but it is unsafe, so y30 cannot be 6 if on freeway.\n\ny30=6 at t=30 unsafe.\n\ny30=5: freeway 5, which is unsafe only at t=30? Freeway 5 unsafe at t=30.\n\nFreeway 5: same as others, unsafe at t=30.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 at t=30: freeway 4 unsafe at t=30.\n\ny=3 at t=30: freeway 3 unsafe.\n\ny=2 at t=30: freeway 2 unsafe.\n\ny=1 at t=30: freeway 1, unsafe? Freeway 1 unsafe at T=40,41,42,43, not at t=30, so safe.\n\ny=7 at t=30: freeway 7, safe at t=30 as above.\n\ny=8 at t=30: freeway 8, safe at t=30.\n\ny=9: safe.\n\nBut y30 <=6 as before? No, now with more turns, y30 can be lower.\n\nFrom t=26 to t=30, with actions at 26,27,28,29.\n\ny30 = 2 + Δy26 + Δy27 + Δy28 + Δy29\n\nMax y30 = 2+4=6, min y30=2-4= -2, but y>=0, so y30 between 0 and 6.\n\nSo y30 <=6, and at t=30, if y30=6, unsafe; y30=5, on freeway 5, unsafe at t=30; similarly y30=4,3,2 all unsafe at t=30 for their freeways.\n\ny30=1: freeway 1, at t=30, ΔT=4, not in unsafe times (14-17), so safe.\n\ny30=0: not freeway, safe.\n\ny30=7: impossible, since max 6.\n\nSo possible safe y30: 0 or 1.\n\ny30=0 or 1.\n\nThen from there, need to reach y34=9.\n\ny34 = y30 + Δy30 + Δy31 + Δy32 + Δy33\n\nIf y30=0, need y34=9, so sum of four Δy = +9, but each <=1, max +4, y34<=4, impossible.\n\ny30=0, y34 <= 0+4=4 <9.\n\nSimilarly, y30=1, y34 <=1+4=5<9.\n\nCannot reach 9 from y30=1 in four actions.\n\ny34 = y30 + sum_{t=30 to 33} Δy_t\n\nFour actions: t=30,31,32,33.\n\ny31 = y30 + Δy30\n\ny32 = y31 + Δy31\n\ny33 = y32 + Δy32\n\ny34 = y33 + Δy33\n\nSo y34 = y30 + Δy30 + Δy31 + Δy32 + Δy33\n\nYes.\n\nIf y30=1, y34 <=1+4=5<9, impossible to reach 9.\n\nSimilarly for y30=0.\n\nBut y30 must be 0 or 1 to be safe at t=30, but then cannot reach y=9 by t=34.\n\nContradiction.\n\nTherefore, for H=8, it is impossible to be safe at t=30 and reach y=9 at t=34.\n\nBecause at t=30, whatever y we are on, if between 2 and 6, it is unsafe, and y=0 or 1, we cannot reach 9 in four steps.\n\nThus H=8 also impossible.\n\nNow, need larger H.\n\nTry H=9: actions from t=26 to t=34, position at t=35=9.\n\ny_{35}=9.\n\nNow, we need to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nFirst, t=30 is unsafe for freeways 2,3,4,5,6.\n\nAlso, t=32 and 33 unsafe for freeways 7 and 8.\n\nAt t=30, we need to not be on freeways 2,3,4,5,6, so must be on y=0,1,7,8,9.\n\nBut y=7 or 8 at t=30: freeway 7 and 8 are safe at t=30, as above.\n\ny=9 safe, y=0 safe, y=1 safe.\n\nBut y=1 is freeway, but safe at t=30.\n\nNow, from start, can we be on y=7 or 8 at t=30?\n\ny30 = 2 + sum_{t=26 to 29} Δy_t <= 2+4=6, so y30<=6, cannot be 7 or 8.\n\ny30 max 6, min 0.\n\nSo at t=30, possible y: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\nBut y=2,3,4,5,6 all unsafe at t=30.\n\ny=1 safe, y=0 safe.\n\nSo we must be on y=0 or 1 at t=30 to avoid collision.\n\nSay y30=0 or 1.\n\nThen from there, need to reach y35=9.\n\nWith five actions: from t=30 to t=34, actions affect y31 to y35.\n\ny35 = y30 + Δy30 + Δy31 + Δy32 + Δy33 + Δy34\n\nIf y30=0, need sum of five Δy = +9, max +5, y35<=5<9 impossible.\n\nIf y30=1, y35<=1+5=6<9 impossible.\n\nStill cannot reach.\n\ny35 = y30 + Δy30 + ... + Δy34, five terms, each <=1, so y35 <= y30 +5.\n\nIf y30=1, y35<=6<9; y30=0, <=5<9.\n\nImpossible.\n\nBut we have more time, so we can reach higher y later.\n\ny30 must be 0 or 1, but from there, in the remaining turns to t=35, we have actions at t=30,31,32,33,34 for y31 to y35.\n\nTo reach y35=9, we need to start from higher y, but y30 is low.\n\nPerhaps we can be at higher y before t=30 or after.\n\nFor example, if we go up faster early or late.\n\nBut from t=26 to t=30, only 4 actions, y from 2, max to 6, which is unsafe at t=30.\n\nMin to 0 or 1, safe but too low.\n\nThen from low, we need many steps to go up.\n\nLet's set t=30 as a point to avoid.\n\nAlso, there are unsafe times at t=32,33 for y=7 and 8.\n\nFirst, let's list all unsafe times for each y:\n\n- y=1: unsafe at t=40,41,42,43 (late, irrelevant)\n\n- y=2: unsafe at t=30\n\n- y=3: unsafe at t=30\n\n- y=4: unsafe at t=30\n\n- y=5: unsafe at t=30\n\n- y=6: unsafe at t=30\n\n- y=7: unsafe at t=32,33\n\n- y=8: unsafe at t=32,33\n\n- y=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nNow, player starts at t=26, y=2.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nTo avoid t=30, we should not be on y=2,3,4,5,6 at t=30.\n\nSo at t=30, we must be on y=0,1,7,8,9.\n\nBut as before, y=7,8,9 impossible at t=30 since y<=6.\n\nSo only y=0 or 1.\n\nSo we must be at y=0 or 1 at t=30.\n\nThat means, by t=30, we need to be at 0 or 1.\n\nFrom t=26 y=2, we can move down or stay to reach y=1 or 0 by t=30.\n\nFor example, do D or S at some turns.\n\nThen from there, go up to 9.\n\nBut it will take more turns.\n\nLet's find minimal H.\n\nSuppose we go down to y=1 at some point.\n\nFor example, at t=26, y=2.\n\nIf we do D at t=26, y27=1\n\nThen at t=27, y=1, freeway 1, safe since not unsafe at t=27.\n\nThen we can stay or move.\n\nBut at t=30, we need to be at y=0 or 1.\n\nIf at t=27, y=1, we can do S for several turns to stay at 1.\n\nThen at t=30, y=1, safe.\n\nThen from t=30, we start going up.\n\nBut y=1 at t=30.\n\nThen we need to go to y=9.\n\nEach U increases y by 1, so from y=1 to y=9, need 8 steps.\n\nBut we can do it over multiple turns.\n\nLet's define the turns.\n\nSet t=30 as reference.\n\nAt t=30, y30=1 (safe).\n\nThen from t=30, we need to reach y=9 at some turn T.\n\nActions from t=30 onwards.\n\ny30=1\n\nThen to reach y=9, minimal actions: 8 U moves, but we may need to avoid other unsafe times, like for y=7 and 8 at t=32,33.\n\nt=32 and 33 are soon after t=30.\n\nt=30, then t=31,32,33,etc.\n\nAt t=32 and 33, we should not be on y=7 or 8 if possible, but we might be.\n\nFirst, let's see how fast we can go up.\n\nSuppose from y30=1, we do U every turn.\n\nThen y31=2, y32=3, y33=4, y34=5, y35=6, y36=7, y37=8, y38=9.\n\nAt t=38, y=9.\n\nBut we need to check safety.\n\nAt t=32, y=3, freeway 3. Is it unsafe? Freeway 3 unsafe only at t=30, not at t=32, so safe.\n\nt=33, y=4, freeway 4, unsafe only at t=30, safe.\n\nt=34, y=5, freeway 5, safe except t=30.\n\nt=35, y=6, freeway 6, safe except t=30.\n\nt=36, y=7, freeway 7. Now at t=36, is it unsafe?\n\nFreeway 7 unsafe at t=32 and 33.\n\nt=36, ΔT=36-26=10, for freeway 7.\n\nFirst car: span at T: [-47 +6ΔT, -36 +6ΔT]\n\n0 in span when -47+6ΔT <=0 <= -36+6ΔT, which is ΔT>=6 and ΔT<=7.833, so ΔT=6,7 → t=32,33.\n\nAt t=36, ΔT=10, -47+60=13>0, -36+60=24>0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSecond car safe always.\n\nSo freeway 7 safe at t=36.\n\nSimilarly, t=37, y=8, freeway 8, similar, unsafe only at t=32,33, so at t=37 safe.\n\nt=38 y=9 safe.\n\nAlso, at t=31, y=2, freeway 2, unsafe only at t=30, so safe at t=31.\n\nAll seem safe.\n\nBut we reached at t=38, which is turn 38, so from t=26 to t=37 actions? Let's see.\n\ny30=1 at t=30.\n\nHow did we get there?\n\nFrom t=26 to t=30.\n\nt=26: y=2\n\nWe need y30=1.\n\nSo from t=26 to t=29 actions, y30 = y26 + Δy26 + Δy27 + Δy28 + Δy29 = 2 + sum of four Δy\n\nSet y30=1, so 2 + sum Δy =1, so sum Δy = -1.\n\nFor example, do one D and three S, or other combinations.\n\nMinimal actions: for example, at t=26, do S, y27=2\n\nt=27, S, y28=2\n\nt=28, S, y29=2\n\nt=29, D, y30=1\n\nOr at t=26, D, y27=1\n\nThen t=27, S, y28=1\n\nt=28, S, y29=1\n\nt=29, S, y30=1\n\nEtc.\n\nNow, check safety during these turns.\n\nAt t=26, y=2, safe as long as not t=30.\n\nt=26 safe.\n\nt=27, if y=2 or 1, etc.\n\nIn first option: t=26: y=2, safe\n\na26=S, y27=2\n\nt=27: y=2, freeway 2, unsafe only at t=30, so safe.\n\na27=S, y28=2\n\nt=28: y=2, safe\n\na28=S, y29=2\n\nt=29: y=2, safe? t=29, not t=30, safe.\n\na29=D, y30=1\n\nt=30: y=1, freeway 1, at t=30 safe, as before.\n\nThen from t=30: a30=U, y31=2\n\nt=31: y=2, freeway 2, safe (not t=30)\n\na31=U, y32=3\n\nt=32: y=3, freeway 3, safe (unsafe only t=30)\n\na32=U, y33=4\n\nt=33: y=4, freeway 4, safe (only unsafe t=30)\n\na33=U, y34=5\n\nt=34: y=5, freeway 5, safe\n\na34=U, y35=6\n\nt=35: y=6, freeway 6, safe\n\na35=U, y36=7\n\nt=36: y=7, freeway 7, safe (unsafe t=32,33, not 36)\n\na36=U, y37=8\n\nt=37: y=8, freeway 8, safe (unsafe t=32,33, not 37)\n\na37=U, y38=9\n\nt=38: y=9, reached.\n\nNow, actions: from t=26 to t=37, 12 actions? Let's list:\n\nt=26: S (action)\n\nt=27: S\n\nt=28: S\n\nt=29: D\n\nt=30: U\n\nt=31: U\n\nt=32: U\n\nt=33: U\n\nt=34: U\n\nt=35: U\n\nt=36: U\n\nt=37: U\n\ny at t=38 is 9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=26 to t=37 inclusive, that's 12 actions, H=12.\n\nBut we can reduce.\n\nIn the descent to y=1, we used three S and one D, but we can go down faster.\n\nFor example, at t=26, D, y27=1\n\nThen at t=27, y=1, we can stay until t=30.\n\na27=S, y28=1\n\na28=S, y29=1\n\na29=S, y30=1\n\nThen same as before.\n\nStill, from t=30 to t=37, 8 actions to go from 1 to 9.\n\nBut we can go up faster, but we have to pass each y, so min 8 steps from 1 to 9.\n\nBut at t=32 and 33, we have unsafe for y=7 and 8, but in the sequence above, at t=32 we are at y=3, not 7 or 8, so safe.\n\nt=33 y=4, safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut H=12 seems large, can we do better?\n\nSince t=30 is the only critical point for y=2-6, and t=32-33 for y=7-8.\n\nBut if we can be at y=7 or 8 before t=32 or after t=33.\n\nFor example, reach y=7 at t=31 or earlier, or at t=34 or later.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nIn the above, we were at low y at t=30.\n\nBut we don't have to be at y=1; we can be at higher y before t=30, but we cannot since max y=6 at t=30, which is unsafe.\n\nUnless we go up and then down, but that might not help.\n\nFor example, from t=26, go U to y=6 quickly, but at t=30 y=6 is bad, so we need to leave before or after.\n\nBut at t=30, if we are on y=6, collision.\n\nWe can be on y=6 at other times, but not at t=30.\n\nSimilarly for other y.\n\nBut for t=30, we must not be on y=2-6.\n\nSo only y=0,1 possible at t=30.\n\nThen from there, we go up.\n\nBut to reduce time, perhaps we can go up to y=6 before t=30, but then at t=30 we need to be at y=1, so we have to go down, which is inefficient.\n\nFor example, suppose we go up fast to y=6 by t=29 or something.\n\nt=26: y=2, a=U, y27=3\n\na=U, y28=4\n\na=U, y29=5\n\na=U, y30=6 but unsafe, so cannot.\n\nAt t=29, y=5, if we do D, y30=4, but y=4 at t=30 unsafe.\n\nIf S, y30=5 unsafe.\n\nIf we go to y=6 earlier.\n\nSuppose at t=26 U, y27=3\n\nt=27 U, y28=4\n\nt=28 U, y29=5\n\nNow at t=29, we can do D, but y30=4 unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nFrom t=26, do nothing for a while.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nAnother idea: since t=32 and 33 are unsafe for y=7 and 8, we can avoid being on y=7 or 8 at t=32 and 33.\n\nIn the go-up phase, we can pause or something.\n\nBut in the sequence above, we were not on high y at t=32,33.\n\nt=32 we were at y=3, t=33 at y=4.\n\nIf we go up faster from t=30, we might be at y=7 or 8 earlier or later.\n\nFor example, from y30=1, if we do U every turn:\n\ny31=2, y32=3, y33=4, y34=5, y35=6, y36=7, y37=8, y38=9\n\nAt t=36, y=7; t=37, y=8; both safe since t=36,37 not 32 or 33.\n\nIf we go faster, but we can't, since each step.\n\nUnless we start from higher y, but y30=1 is low.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=1 earlier, so that from t=30 we are higher.\n\nFor example, go to y=1 at t=28 or something.\n\nLet's define.\n\nSet the time to reach y=1.\n\nSuppose at some turn before t=30, we are at y=1, and stay until t=30.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=26: y=2, a=D, y27=1\n\nt=27: y=1, a=S, y28=1\n\nt=28: y=1, a=S, y29=1\n\nt=29: y=1, a=S, y30=1\n\nThen same as before.\n\nFrom t=27 to t=29, we are at y=1, which is safe, since freeway 1 unsafe only late.\n\nThen from t=30: U to y31=2\n\netc., same as before, reach y38=9.\n\nTo save time, we can go up from y=1 starting earlier, but at t=30 we need to be at y=1, so we have to stay or be there.\n\nIf we go down to y=1 at t=27, then from t=27 to t=30, we stay at 1, then go up.\n\nBut from t=27 to t=30, we are not progressing, so it takes time.\n\nMinimal time: we need to spend t=30 at y=0 or 1.\n\nThen from there to y=9, min 9 turns from y=0 or 8 from y=1.\n\nBut we start from y=2 at t=26.\n\nTo go to y=1, we can do it in one step, e.g., at t=26 D, y27=1.\n\nThen from t=27 to t=30, we must be at y=1 (since if we move, y changes, and at t=30 we may not be at 1).\n\nFor example, if at t=27 y=1, we can do actions to stay or move, but to be at y=1 at t=30, we need to ensure.\n\nSince we can choose, we can stay at y=1 from t=27 to t=30.\n\nThen go up.\n\nt=27: y=1\n\nt=28: y=1 (a=S)\n\nt=29: y=1 (a=S)\n\nt=30: y=1 (a=S)\n\nThen t=30: a=U, y31=2\n\nt=31: a=U, y32=3\n\nt=32: a=U, y33=4\n\nt=33: a=U, y34=5\n\nt=34: a=U, y35=6\n\nt=35: a=U, y36=7\n\nt=36: a=U, y37=8\n\nt=37: a=U, y38=9\n\nBut at t=37, y=8, a=U, y38=9.\n\nNow, actions from t=26 to t=37.\n\nt=26: action D\n\nt=27: S\n\nt=28: S\n\nt=29: S\n\nt=30: U\n\nt=31: U\n\nt=32: U\n\nt=33: U\n\nt=34: U\n\nt=35: U\n\nt=36: U\n\nt=37: U\n\ny38=9, so H=12 actions, from t=26 to t=37.\n\nBut we can start going up earlier.\n\nFor example, from t=27, y=1, instead of staying, we can go up, but then at t=30 we need to be at y=1, so we have to come back down, which is worse.\n\nFor example, t=27 y=1, a=U, y28=2\n\nBut at t=28, y=2, which is safe, but then to be at y=1 at t=30, we need to go down, e.g. t=28 a=D, y29=1, t=29 a=S, y30=1, but we wasted moves.\n\nSo better to stay at y=1 until t=30.\n\nThen go up steadily.\n\nBut we can be at y=1 at t=30 with less waiting.\n\nFor example, at t=26: S, y27=2\n\nt=27: S, y28=2\n\nt=28: D, y29=1\n\nt=29: S, y30=1\n\nThen from t=30 U, etc.\n\nStill, from t=30 to t=37, 8 actions, plus before, total 10 actions? Actions at t=26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37? t=26 to t=37 is 12 actions.\n\nt=26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37: 12 turns.\n\nPosition at t=38=9.\n\nSince we reach at t=38, with actions up to t=37.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, from t=26 to t=26+H-1 actions, position at t=26+H.\n\nHere t=26+H =38, so H=12.\n\nBut perhaps we can reach faster by not going to y=1, but to y=0, but y=0 is lower, worse.\n\nOr by avoiding the unsafe times differently.\n\nAnother idea: since t=32 and 33 are unsafe for y=7 and 8, but in our sequence, we are not at high y then, so no problem.\n\nBut if we can be at y=9 earlier by not going down.\n\nBut we have to avoid t=30 on y=2-6.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=7 or 8 at t=30, but impossible.\n\nOr at t=30, be on y=9, but impossible from start.\n\nSo I think the above is necessary.\n\nBut let's confirm if there are other unsafe times.\n\nFreeway 1 has unsafe at t=40-43, but late.\n\nFreeway 6 has only t=30 unsafe, etc.\n\nIn the go-up phase, from t=30, y=1 to y=9, we pass y=7 at t=36, which is safe, y=8 at t=37 safe.\n\nBut at t=32 and 33, we are at low y, safe.\n\nSo the sequence works with H=12.\n\nBut we can reduce H by going up faster where possible.\n\nFor example, from y=1 to y=9, min 8 steps, but if we can start from higher y, but we start from low at t=30.\n\nPerhaps we don't need to stay at y=1 for multiple turns; we can be at y=1 only at t=30.\n\nFor example, go to y=1 exactly at t=30.\n\nFrom t=26 y=2.\n\nTo have y30=1.\n\ny30 = 2 + Δy26 + Δy27 + Δy28 + Δy29 =1\n\nSo Δy26 + Δy27 + Δy28 + Δy29 = -1\n\nFor example, three S and one D, or one D and three S, etc.\n\nSuppose we do:\n\nt=26: S, y27=2\n\nt=27: S, y28=2\n\nt=28: S, y29=2\n\nt=29: D, y30=1\n\nThen at t=29, y=2, which is safe since not t=30.\n\nThen y30=1.\n\nThen from t=30: U, y31=2\n\nt=31: U, y32=3\n\nt=32: U, y33=4\n\nt=33: U, y34=5\n\nt=34: U, y35=6\n\nt=35: U, y36=7\n\nt=36: U, y37=8\n\nt=37: U, y38=9\n\nSame as before, 12 actions.\n\nFrom t=26: D, y27=1\n\nThen t=27: now y=1, but we need y30=1, so we must do S from t=27 to t=29.\n\nt=27: a=S, y28=1\n\nt=28: a=S, y29=1\n\nt=29: a=S, y30=1\n\nThen same as above.\n\nNo saving.\n\nBut at t=27, y=1, we can go up, but then we are not at y=1 at t=30, so we need to adjust.\n\nFor example, t=26: D, y27=1\n\nt=27: U, y28=2  // go up\n\nt=28: U, y29=3\n\nt=29: D, y30=2? But y=2 at t=30 unsafe!\n\nNot good.\n\nt=29: D to y30=1, but from y29=3, a29=D, y30=2, not 1.\n\ny29=3, a29=D, y30=2, which is unsafe at t=30.\n\nIf a29=S, y30=3 unsafe.\n\nTo reach y30=1, from y29, must be y29=1 or 2 with D.\n\nBut if y29=1, a29=S, y30=1.\n\nOr y29=2, a29=D, y30=1.\n\nBut in this case, from t=27 y=1, if we go up to y=2 or 3, then at t=29 we need to be at y=1 or 2 to go to y=1.\n\nBut if at t=29 y=2, a29=D, y30=1, but at t=29 y=2 is safe, but we used extra moves.\n\nFor example: t=26: D, y27=1\n\nt=27: U, y28=2  // wasted, back to 2\n\nt=28: D, y29=1  // down to 1\n\nt=29: S, y30=1\n\nThen from t=30 U, etc.\n\nBut we have extra moves, so it takes more turns to reach y=9.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo minimal is to stay at y=1 from when we reach it until t=30, or reach it at t=30 directly.\n\nIn both cases, we start going up from t=30 at y=1, reach y=9 at t=38.\n\nH=12.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach earlier by not going to y=1.\n\nFor example, if we can be on y=0 at t=30, but y=0 is lower, then it takes more steps to go up.\n\nWorse.\n\nPerhaps we can pass the dangerous zones at safe times.\n\nFor instance, for y=6, it is only unsafe at t=30, so we can be on y=6 at other times.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut the problem is at t=30 specifically.\n\nSince we have to be at some y at t=30, and only y=0 or 1 are safe.\n\nSo I think H=12 is the minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the answer format.\n\nWe need the sequence from turn t_1=26.\n\nIn the sequence, we have actions from t=26 to t=37.\n\nPosition at t=38=9.\n\nH=12 turns.\n\nBut perhaps we can do better by considering that at t=32 and 33, we can be on safe y.\n\nBut in the sequence, it's fine.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=6 before t=30, then at t=30, be on y=7 or 8, but impossible since y<=6 at t=30.\n\nCannot.\n\nStart from t=26, go down to y=0 or 1 quickly, then up.\n\nBut y=0 is worse.\n\nFor example, t=26: D, y27=1\n\nt=27: D, but y=1, D to y28=0\n\nThen at t=30, we can be at y=0, safe.\n\nBut then from y=0 to y=9, need 9 steps, reach at t=39 or later, worse.\n\nSo better to be at y=1.\n\nThus, the sequence I have seems optimal.\n\nNow, about the cars on freeway 6,7,8.\n\nIn freeway 6, there is a second car (24,13,right,12), but we saw it never causes collision, so fine.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, for the action sequence.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=32 and t=33, we are at y=3 and y=4, which are safe.\n\nBut t=32 and t=33 are unsafe for y=7 and 8, but we are not on them.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps we can reach faster by going up slower at some points, but I don't think so.\n\nSince from t=30 y=1, we go up 8 steps to y=9 at t=38.\n\nBut if we could start from higher, but we start from low.\n\nAnother thought: at t=26, y=2, we can go up immediately to y=3,4,5, but then at t=29, we need to go down to y=1 for t=30.\n\nFor example, t=26: U, y27=3\n\nt=27: U, y28=4\n\nt=28: U, y29=5\n\nt=29: D, y30=4? But y=4 at t=30 unsafe.\n\nt=29: D from y=5, y30=4, unsafe.\n\nt=29: S, y30=5 unsafe.\n\nTo reach y30=1, from y29=5, need to go down, e.g. t=29: D, but y30=4, not 1.\n\nCannot reach y=1 from y=5 in one step.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nThus, we must be at y=1 or 0 at t=30 with low y.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 12.\n\nBut let's list the actions clearly.\n\nTurn t_1 = 26\n\nPlayer position: (0,2)\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 26: D  (to go down to y=1 faster, but in sequence, we can choose)\n\nTo have y30=1.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 26: S  (y=2)\n\nTurn 27: S  (y=2)\n\nTurn 28: S  (y=2)\n\nTurn 29: D  (y=1 at t=30)\n\nThen\n\nTurn 30: U  (y=2 at t=31)\n\nTurn 31: U  (y=3)\n\nTurn 32: U  (y=4)\n\nTurn 33: U  (y=5)\n\nTurn 34: U  (y=6)\n\nTurn 35: U  (y=7)\n\nTurn 36: U  (y=8)\n\nTurn 37: U  (y=9 at t=38)\n\ny at t=38=9.\n\nActions from turn 26 to 37, 12 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 29: D, from y=2 to y=1? t=29 action, y30 = y29 + Δy29.\n\nt=29 position y29, after action a29, y30.\n\nIn the above: t=28: after actions, y28=2 (from a28=S)\n\nt=29: position y29=2, a29=D, then y30=1\n\nt=30: position y30=1, a30=U, y31=2\n\netc.\n\nAll safe.\n\nWe can have turn 26: D, y27=1\n\nThen to keep y=1 until t=30:\n\nTurn 26: D  (y=1 at t=27)\n\nTurn 27: S  (y=1 at t=28)\n\nTurn 28: S  (y=1 at t=29)\n\nTurn 29: S  (y=1 at t=30)\n\nThen same up actions.\n\nSame number.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the sequence, we reach at t=38, but let's see if we can reduce by one or something.\n\nPerhaps at some point we can skip a step, but no.\n\nAnother idea: since y=7 and 8 are unsafe at t=32,33, but if we can be at y=7 before t=32 or after t=33.\n\nIn the above, we are at y=7 at t=36, which is after, safe.\n\nBut if we go up faster from t=30, we might be at y=7 at t=36 or earlier.\n\nFrom y30=1, after 5 U: y31=2, y32=3, y33=4, y34=5, y35=6, so at t=35 y=6, then t=36 y=7, same as before.\n\nCannot be faster.\n\nFrom y=1, min turn to y=7 is t=30 +6 = t=36, since y31=2, y32=3, ..., y36=7.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think H=12 is minimal.\n\nNow for the car on freeway 1, but we are on it only at t=27 or something, but safe.\n\nIn the sequence where we go to y=1 at t=27 and stay, at t=27 to t=30 we are on y=1, freeway 1, but unsafe only at t=40-43, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nThe minimal H is 12, with actions from t=26 to t=37.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 26: S (or D, but let's use S to not go down immediately)\n\nIn the first sequence:\n\nTurn 26: S\n\nTurn 27: S\n\nTurn 28: S\n\nTurn 29: D\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nTurn 33: U\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nPosition at t=38: y=9.\n\nIn the actions, at turn 29: D, which is down, but from y=2 to y=1, fine.\n\nWe can have all S until turn 28, then D at 29.\n\nBut to make it cleaner, perhaps go down at the beginning.\n\nSince the problem allows, and to reach y=1 faster.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 26: D  // y=1 at t=27\n\nThen to stay:\n\nTurn 27: S  // y=1 at t=28\n\nTurn 28: S  // y=1 at t=29\n\nTurn 29: S  // y=1 at t=30\n\nThen up same.\n\nIn this case, at turn 26: D, action down.\n\nThen turns 27,28,29: S\n\nThen up.\n\nBut same number.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n\nNow for the output.\n\nThe answer should be in a box.\n\nAlso, note that at t=32 and t=33, in the sequence, we are on y=3 and y=4, which are safe, no car issues.\n\nSimilarly, no other cars cause problems at those times.\n\nSo I think this works.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 26\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 12. This requires a sequence of actions from turn 26 to turn 37, resulting in the player reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 38.\n\n### Key Constraints and Strategy:\n- **Unsafe Times for Freeways**:\n  - Freeways \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\) are unsafe at turn 30 due to car collisions.\n  - Freeways \\(y = 7, 8\\) are unsafe at turns 32 and 33 due to car collisions.\n  - To avoid collision at turn 30, the player must be on \\(y = 0\\) or \\(y = 1\\) at that turn, as these positions are safe.\n  - Starting from \\(y = 2\\) at turn 26, the player moves down to \\(y = 1\\) by turn 27 and stays there until turn 30 to ensure safety.\n  - From turn 30 onwards, the player moves up steadily to \\(y = 9\\), avoiding the unsafe times for \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) by not being on those freeways at turns 32 and 33.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions minimizes \\(H\\) by:\n1. Moving down to \\(y = 1\\) quickly at turn 27.\n2. Staying at \\(y = 1\\) until turn 30 to avoid the unsafe freeways at turn 30.\n3. Moving up consistently from turn 30 to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 38, with no collisions during the ascent.\n\nThe actions are as follows:\n- Turn 26: \\(D\\) (move down to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 27).\n- Turn 27: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 1\\) at turn 28).\n- Turn 28: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 1\\) at turn 29).\n- Turn 29: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 1\\) at turn 30).\n- Turn 30: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 31).\n- Turn 31: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 32).\n- Turn 32: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 33).\n- Turn 33: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 34).\n- Turn 34: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 35).\n- Turn 35: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 36).\n- Turn 36: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 37).\n- Turn 37: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 38).\n\n### Verification:\n- **Collision Avoidance**:\n  - Turns 26-29: Player is on \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1) at turns 27-30. Freeway 1 is only unsafe at turns 40-43, so safe.\n  - Turn 30: Player on \\(y = 1\\), safe as above.\n  - Turns 31-35: Player on \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 6\\). These freeways are only unsafe at turn 30, so safe at other times.\n  - Turns 36-37: Player on \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) at turns 36 and 37. Freeways 7 and 8 are unsafe only at turns 32 and 33, so safe at turns 36 and 37.\n  - Turn 38: Player on \\(y = 9\\), no freeway, safe.\n- **Efficiency**: The sequence uses the minimal \\(H = 12\\) as it is impossible to reach \\(y = 9\\) in fewer turns without collision due to the constraints at turn 30 and the need to move from \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 9\\) in 8 steps.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 26: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 27: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 28: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 29: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 30: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 31: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 32: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 33: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 34: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 35: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 36: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 37: U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 28, and I have to output a sequence of actions starting from turn 28.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0 respectively, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollisions happen only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where there's a car whose span includes x=0 at that turn. The span moves left or right based on the direction and speed.\n\nImportant point: when you move to a new y-position, you're not on that freeway until the next turn. So at turn T, if you move from y_T to y_{T+1}, you're only on y_T at turn T, and on y_{T+1} at turn T+1. So for collision, at turn T, we only care about cars on the current y_T at that turn.\n\nNow, let's list the car states for each freeway at turn t_1 = 28.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, right-moving, head -24, tail -47? That seems odd. Head should be the front, tail the back. For right-moving, it says span is [τ, h] with h > τ, I think. Let me check the update rule.\n\nFor left-moving: span [h, τ] with h > τ? No, it says for left-moving: span(t_1) = [h, τ], and at T, it becomes [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]. Since it's moving left, h decreases, so probably h is the right end or something. I need to interpret the head and tail.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nFor left-moving car: \"head is at h, tail is at τ\" and span is [h, τ]. But if it's moving left, and span is [h, τ], with h and τ positions. Then at time T, it becomes [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so both decrease, so the car is moving left.\n\nBut in the span, for left-moving, it should be that h is the right end or left? The notation says \"head\" and \"tail\", but in the span, for left-moving, it's [h, τ], and since it moves left, h decreases, so probably h is the right end (front when moving left), and τ is the left end (back).\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: span is [τ, h], and it becomes [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], so both increase, so τ is the left end (front when moving right), h is the right end (back).\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nFor freeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 3)\n\nDirection is right, so for right-moving, span should be [τ, h], so τ is the front? But here head is -36, tail is -47. Since it's right-moving, and head and tail, I think head is the front.\n\nIn the description, it says \"head is at h, tail is at τ\" for both, but the span is defined differently.\n\nFor left-moving: span(t_1) = [h, τ]\n\nFor right-moving: span(t_1) = [τ, h]\n\nSo for right-moving, span is [τ, h], meaning from τ to h, with h > τ since moving right.\n\nIn this case, for freeway 1: head h = -36, tail τ = -47, direction right, so since direction is right, span is [τ, h] = [-47, -36]. τ = -47, h = -36, so -47 to -36, which is from left to right? -47 is smaller, so position -47 to -36, so as it moves right, positions increase.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, span [h, τ], with h > τ, I assume.\n\nBut in the car list, for freeway 1, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed) = (-36, -47, right, 3)\n\nSo head is -36, tail is -47, dir right, so span is [τ, h] = [-47, -36] for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, at any turn T, for a car, the span at T is:\n\nFor right-moving car: [τ + s*(T - t_1), h + s*(T - t_1)]\n\nSince at t_1, it's [τ, h], and it moves right.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: [h - s*(T - t_1), τ - s*(T - t_1)]\n\nCollision at turn T if player is on freeway k, and for that freeway, there is a car with 0 in its span at T.\n\nPlayer position at turn T is (0, y_T), so we care about freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nNow, t_1 = 28, so for a car, at time T, ΔT = T - 28.\n\nLet me list all cars per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, right, τ = -47, h = -36, s = 3\n\nSpan at T: [ -47 + 3*(T-28), -36 + 3*(T-28) ]\n\nFreeway 2: one car, (-24, -35, right, 12)\n\nτ = -35? Head h = -24, tail τ = -35, dir right, s=12\n\nSpan at T: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-35 + 12*(T-28), -24 + 12*(T-28)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? (-24, -35, right, 12) — it says \"3 | (-24, -35, right, 12)\" so one car same as freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: same, (-24, -35, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 5: same, (-24, -35, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 6: two cars: (-24, -35, right, 12) and (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: h=-24, τ=-35, right, s=12, span at T: [-35 +12ΔT, -24 +12ΔT]\n\nSecond car: (48, 37, right, 12) — head 48, tail 37? Since right, span [τ, h] = [37, 48]? Head is 48, tail is 37, so τ=37, h=48, span [37,48] at t_1.\n\nThen at T: [37 +12ΔT, 48 +12ΔT]\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (-24, -35, right, 6) and (24, 13, right, 6)\n\nFirst car: h=-24, τ=-35, right, s=6, span at T: [-35 +6ΔT, -24 +6ΔT]\n\nSecond car: (24, 13, right, 6) head=24, tail=13, span [13,24] at t_1, at T: [13 +6ΔT, 24 +6ΔT]\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7: (-24, -35, right, 6) and (24, 13, right, 6)\n\nPlayer starts at y=3 at turn 28.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is the top, but freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=9 might be safe, no cars, I think. The goal is (0,9), and freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars.\n\nBut when moving, we need to pass through y=4 to y=8.\n\nNow, to minimize H, the number of turns, since we can move up or down, but to go from 3 to 9, we need to move up at least 6 times, but we can stay or move down, which might be necessary to avoid collisions, but that would increase H, so probably we want to move up as much as possible, but avoiding collisions.\n\nThe minimal H would be 6, if we can move up 6 times in a row without collision.\n\nBut we need to check for each freeway whether at the turn we are on it, x=0 is occupied.\n\nPlayer at turn T is on y_T.\n\nStart at T=28, y=3.\n\nWe need to find actions for t=28 to some T where y_T=9.\n\nLet me denote T relative to t_1=28. Set τ = T - 28, so at τ=0, y=3.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some τ=H-1, so after H actions, from τ=0 to τ=H-1, y from 3 to 9.\n\nThe position at time T=28 + τ is y_{28+τ}, and we care about the freeway at that time.\n\nFor each freeway, I need to find when x=0 is covered by a car on that freeway.\n\nA car covers x=0 at time T if 0 is in the span at T.\n\nFor each car, I can find the time when it covers x=0.\n\nBut for a given freeway, there might be multiple cars, so I need to find all times when for that freeway, some car has 0 in span.\n\nThen, at turn T, if y_T = k, and at that T, freeway k has a car covering 0, then collision if we are on it.\n\nSince we are only on one freeway per turn, we care about y_T at T.\n\nNow, let's find for each freeway the times when it is occupied at x=0.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: y=1\n\nCars: one car, right-moving, τ=-47, h=-36, s=3\n\nSpan at T: [ -47 + 3(ΔT), -36 + 3(ΔT) ] where ΔT = T - 28\n\nSet 0 in [A, B] where A = -47 + 3ΔT, B = -36 + 3ΔT\n\nSo A <= 0 <= B\n\n-47 + 3ΔT <= 0 <= -36 + 3ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -47 + 3ΔT <= 0 => 3ΔT <= 47 => ΔT <= 47/3 ≈ 15.666, so ΔT <= 15 since integer? T is turn, so ΔT integer.\n\nΔT = T - 28, integer.\n\n-47 + 3ΔT <= 0 => 3ΔT <= 47 => ΔT <= 47/3 = 15 + 2/3, so ΔT <= 15\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= -36 + 3ΔT => 3ΔT >= 36 => ΔT >= 12\n\nSo for ΔT from 12 to 15 inclusive, x=0 is covered.\n\nA <= 0 <= B\n\nA = -47 + 3ΔT <= 0 for ΔT <= floor(47/3) = 15 since 3*15=45 <47? 3*15=45, -47+45= -2 <=0, yes; ΔT=16: -47+48=1>0, not <=0.\n\nA <=0: -47 +3ΔT <=0 => 3ΔT <=47 => ΔT <= floor(47/3) =15 since 47/3=15.666, floor 15.\n\n3*15=45, -47+45= -2 <=0, yes; 3*16=48, -47+48=1>0, not <=0.\n\n0 <= B: 0 <= -36 +3ΔT => 36 <= 3ΔT => ΔT >= 12.\n\nB = -36 +3ΔT, 0 <= B when -36 +3ΔT >=0 => 3ΔT >=36 => ΔT >=12.\n\nAt ΔT=12: B= -36+36=0, 0<=0 true.\n\nAt ΔT=11: B= -36+33= -3 <0, 0<= -3 false.\n\nSo ΔT from 12 to 15 inclusive, x=0 covered on freeway 1.\n\nSo for T from 28+12=40 to 28+15=43, freeway 1 occupied at x=0.\n\nΔT=12 to 15, T=40 to 43.\n\nNow freeway 2: y=2\n\nCars: one car, (-24,-35,right,12) so τ=-35, h=-24, s=12\n\nSpan at T: [-35 +12ΔT, -24 +12ΔT]\n\n0 in [A,B] with A=-35+12ΔT, B=-24+12ΔT\n\nA <=0 <= B\n\nA <=0: -35+12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <=35 => ΔT <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so ΔT <=2\n\n0 <= B: 0 <= -24 +12ΔT => 12ΔT >=24 => ΔT >=2\n\nSo ΔT=2: A= -35+24= -11 <=0, B= -24+24=0, 0<=0 true.\n\nΔT=1: A= -35+12= -23 <=0, B= -24+12= -12 <0, so 0 <= B false.\n\nΔT=3: A= -35+36=1>0, not <=0.\n\nSo only at ΔT=2, T=30, freeway 2 occupied.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, one car identical, so also occupied only at T=30.\n\nFreeway 4: same, occupied at T=30.\n\nFreeway 5: same, occupied at T=30.\n\nNow freeway 6: y=6\n\nTwo cars.\n\nFirst car: (-24,-35,right,12) same as before, τ=-35, h=-24, s=12\n\nThis car covers x=0 at ΔT=2, T=30, as above.\n\nBut freeway 6 has another car: (48,37,right,12) head=48, tail=37, so for right-moving, span [τ,h] = [37,48] at t_1.\n\nAt T: [37 +12ΔT, 48 +12ΔT]\n\n0 in [37+12ΔT, 48+12ΔT]\n\nA=37+12ΔT <=0? But A=37+12ΔT >=37>0 for ΔT>=0, so A>0, thus 0 < A, not in [A,B] since A>0, so never covers x=0. Because min position is 37 at t_1, moving right, always positive, never at 0.\n\nSo only the first car matters for freeway 6, covering x=0 at T=30.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: y=7\n\nCars: (-24,-35,right,6) and (24,13,right,6)\n\nFirst car: τ=-35, h=-24, s=6\n\nSpan at T: [-35 +6ΔT, -24 +6ΔT]\n\n0 in [A,B] A=-35+6ΔT, B=-24+6ΔT\n\nA <=0 <= B\n\nA <=0: -35+6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=35 => ΔT <= 35/6 ≈5.833, so ΔT <=5\n\n0 <= B: 0 <= -24 +6ΔT => 6ΔT >=24 => ΔT >=4\n\nSo ΔT from 4 to 5 inclusive.\n\nT=28+4=32 to 28+5=33.\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,6) head=24, tail=13, span [13,24] at t_1, at T: [13+6ΔT, 24+6ΔT]\n\nA=13+6ΔT >=13>0, so never <=0, and increasing, so never covers x=0.\n\nSo only first car matters, occupied at T=32 and 33.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: y=8\n\nSame as freeway 7: two cars, but first car (-24,-35,right,6) same, so occupied at T=32 and 33.\n\nSecond car (24,13,right,6) never at 0.\n\nNow, also freeway 3,4,5 are same as 2, occupied only at T=30.\n\nFreeway 1 occupied T=40 to 43.\n\nPlayer starts at y=3 at T=28.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so once we reach y=9, it's safe.\n\nNow, the dangerous times for each freeway:\n\ny=1: occupied T=40,41,42,43\n\ny=2: occupied T=30\n\ny=3: at T=28, y=3, but is freeway 3 occupied at T=28?\n\nFreeway 3 has a car that covers x=0 only at T=30, as above.\n\nAt T=28, ΔT=0, for freeway 3 car: span [-35 +12*0, -24+12*0] = [-35,-24], 0 not in this, so safe at T=28.\n\nSimilarly, y=4: freeway 4, same as y=2,3, occupied only at T=30.\n\nAt T=28, safe.\n\ny=5: same, occupied T=30.\n\ny=6: occupied T=30\n\ny=7: occupied T=32,33\n\ny=8: occupied T=32,33\n\nNow, player at T=28, y=3.\n\nWe need to choose actions to move up.\n\nMinimal H: if no cars, we could go up 6 times: actions U,U,U,U,U,U, from y=3 to 4,5,6,7,8,9 in 6 turns, reaching at T=33? Let's see:\n\nAfter action at T=28, position at T=29.\n\nTurn: action at t, position at t+1? The update is: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy based on a_t.\n\nSo at time t, we are at position y_t, then we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, but t from 0, so turn t_1 + t, action a_{t_1 + t}, and after H actions, we are at y_{t_1 + H} =9? Let's see the indices.\n\nStart at turn t_1=28, position (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,3)\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, we have y_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}\n\nGenerally, after action at time t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9? The sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so actions at times t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at time t_1 + H, we have y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nSince we start at y_{t_1} =3, we need to increase y by 6, so minimum H=6, if all actions U.\n\nWith actions, y increases by number of U minus number of D, so net +6, so H >=6.\n\nCan we achieve in 6 turns?\n\nTry: all U from T=28 to T=33? Actions at T=28 to T=33? t from 0 to H-1.\n\nSet τ from 0.\n\nAt time T=28 + τ, for τ=0,1,2,... \n\nPosition y_{28+τ} depends on actions up to τ-1.\n\nStart: at τ=0, T=28, y=3\n\nAfter action a_{28}, y_{29} = y_28 + Δy_28\n\nSimilarly, after a_{29}, y_{30} = y_{29} + Δy_{29}, and so on.\n\nWe want for some H, after H actions, y_{28+H} =9.\n\nSince y_{28} =3, we need y_{28+H} =3 + sum_{k=0}^{H-1} Δy_{28+k} =9\n\nEach Δy is +1, -1, or 0, so sum must be +6.\n\nMinimal H is 6, with all Δy = +1.\n\nNow, during the path, at each time T from 28 to 28+H-1, we are at y_T, and must not have collision, meaning that at that T, for freeway y_T, no car covers x=0.\n\nCollision at turn T if at that turn, player is on freeway y_T and x=0 is covered.\n\nFor T from 28 to 28+H-1, we are on the grid during these turns, and at T=28+H, we reach y=9, which is safe.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to be safe at times T=28, 29, ..., up to T=28+H-1, and at T=28+H we are at y=9 safe.\n\nNow, with all U, let's simulate:\n\nAction at T=28: U, so y_{29} = 3 +1 =4\n\nAt T=28, we are at y=3, which is freeway 3.\n\nAt T=28, freeway 3: occupied? As above, only at T=30, so at T=28, not occupied, safe.\n\nAction at T=29: U, y_{30} =4 +1=5\n\nAt T=29, we are at y=4? Position at time T=29 is y_{29}.\n\nAfter action at T=28, y_{29}=4.\n\nSo at time T=29, we are on y=4.\n\nFreeway 4 at T=29: occupied? Freeway 4 is occupied only at T=30, so at T=29, not occupied, safe.\n\nAction at T=30: U, y_{31} =5 +1=6\n\nAt T=30, we are at y=5 (since y_{30}=5)\n\nFreeway 5 at T=30: occupied? Freeway 5 occupied at T=30, yes! At T=30, freeway 5 has a car covering x=0.\n\nSo if we are on y=5 at T=30, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nIn this sequence: at T=30, y=5, and freeway 5 occupied.\n\nSo collision, cannot go straight up.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=5 at T=30, or on any occupied freeway at that time.\n\nSimilarly, other points.\n\nSince y=5 is occupied at T=30, we need to not be on y=5 at T=30.\n\nSimilarly, y=2,3,4,6 are also occupied at T=30? Let's see:\n\ny=2: occupied at T=30\n\ny=3: occupied at T=30? Freeway 3: earlier I said occupied at T=30.\n\nFreeway 3: car at T=30, ΔT=2, covered.\n\nSimilarly y=4,5,6 all have cars that cover at T=30.\n\ny=4: freeway 4, same car type, occupied T=30.\n\ny=5: same, T=30.\n\ny=6: freeway 6, occupied T=30.\n\ny=1: not at T=30, only later.\n\ny=7: not at T=30, occupied later.\n\nAt T=30, freeways y=2,3,4,5,6 are all occupied at x=0.\n\ny=2,3,4,5,6 each have a car that covers x=0 at T=30.\n\nSpecifically:\n\ny=2: occupied T=30\n\ny=3: occupied T=30\n\ny=4: occupied T=30\n\ny=5: occupied T=30\n\ny=6: occupied T=30 (from first car)\n\ny=1: not\n\ny=7: occupied T=32,33\n\ny=8: occupied T=32,33\n\nNow, player starts at T=28, y=3.\n\nAt T=28, y=3, not occupied (only at T=30)\n\nWe need to be at some y at T=30 that is not occupied.\n\nAt T=30, freeways 2,3,4,5,6 occupied, so only y=1,7,8 are safe, but y=1 is freeway 1, which might be occupied later, but at T=30, freeway 1 is not occupied, since occupied from T=40.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at T=30: freeway 7 occupied at T=32,33, not at T=30.\n\nSimilarly y=8.\n\nAlso y=0 and y=9 are safe, but we are on freeways during movement.\n\nAt T=30, possible safe y: 0,1,7,8,9.\n\nBut we need to be on the grid.\n\nNow, from start, at T=28, y=3.\n\nWe have actions at T=28 and T=29 to determine y at T=30.\n\ny_{30} = y_{28} + Δy_{28} + Δy_{29}\n\ny_{28} =3\n\nΔy_{28} and Δy_{29} each in {-1,0,1}\n\nSo y_{30} = 3 + d28 + d29, where d = Δy.\n\nPossible y_{30} from 1 to 5.\n\nMin: both D, y=3-1-1=1\n\nMax: both U, y=3+1+1=5\n\nWith S: e.g., U and S: 3+1+0=4, etc.\n\nSo y_{30} can be 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nBut at T=30, safe y are 0,1,7,8,9.\n\nBut from above, y_{30} can only be 1,2,3,4,5, so possible safe is only y=1.\n\ny=0 is possible? y_{30} min is 1 if both D, but y=0 is possible? y in [0,9], but with actions, from y=3, after two downs, y_{30} = 3 -1 -1 =1? Let's see:\n\nAt T=28, y=3\n\nAction a_{28}: if D, y_{29} = 3 -1 =2\n\nThen at T=29, y=2\n\nAction a_{29}: if D, y_{30} =2 -1 =1\n\nIf a_{29} S, y_{30}=2+0=2\n\nIf U, y_{30}=2+1=3\n\nSimilarly, if a_{28} S, y_{29}=3+0=3\n\nThen a_{29}: D, y_{30}=3-1=2; S, y_{30}=3; U, y_{30}=4\n\nIf a_{28} U, y_{29}=4\n\na_{29}: D, y_{30}=4-1=3; S, y_{30}=4; U, y_{30}=5\n\nSo possible y_{30}: if actions DD: y=1; DS or SD: y=2; SS: y=3; SU or US: y=4; UU: y=5.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- DD: y_{30}=1\n\n- DS: a28=D, a29=S: y29=2, y30=2\n\n- DU: a28=D, a29=U: y29=2, y30=3\n\n- SD: a28=S, a29=D: y29=3, y30=2\n\n- SS: a28=S, a29=S: y29=3, y30=3\n\n- SU: a28=S, a29=U: y29=3, y30=4\n\n- UD: a28=U, a29=D: y29=4, y30=3\n\n- US: a28=U, a29=S: y29=4, y30=4\n\n- UU: a28=U, a29=U: y29=4, y30=5\n\nSo y_{30} can be 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nAt T=30, safe y are 0,1,7,8,9, but achievable only y=1, since 0,7,8,9 not possible with two actions from y=3.\n\ny=1 is achievable with DD: y_{30}=1\n\ny=1 is safe at T=30, since freeway 1 occupied only later.\n\nOther y=2,3,4,5 are occupied at T=30.\n\nSo to avoid collision at T=30, we must be at y=1 at T=30.\n\nThus, actions at T=28 and T=29 must be both D, so y_{30}=1.\n\nThen at T=30, we are at y=1, which is safe.\n\nNow, from there, we need to go to y=9.\n\ny=1 at T=30.\n\nNow, freeway 1 is occupied from T=40 to 43, but T=30 is early, so safe.\n\nWe need to move up.\n\nBut there are other occupied times.\n\nSpecifically, freeway 7 and 8 occupied at T=32 and 33.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nPossible to go up directly.\n\nBut let's see the times.\n\nAfter T=30, we are at y=1.\n\nWe can start moving up.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at T=32 or T=33, since occupied.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways might have issues, but y=2 to 6 are safe after T=30? At T=31, for example.\n\nFirst, let's list all dangerous times:\n\n- y=1: occupied T=40,41,42,43\n\n- y=2: only T=30, so after T=30, safe\n\n- y=3: only T=30, safe after\n\n- y=4: only T=30, safe after\n\n- y=5: only T=30, safe after\n\n- y=6: only T=30, safe after\n\n- y=7: occupied T=32,33\n\n- y=8: occupied T=32,33\n\ny=7 and 8 also occupied at T=32 and 33 only? Earlier.\n\nFreeway 7: occupied T=32,33\n\nSimilarly y=8.\n\nAfter T=33, all freeways safe, except y=1 occupied later, but we can avoid.\n\nNow, player at T=30, y=1.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe dangerous times are T=32 and 33 for y=7 and 8.\n\nWe need to not be on y=7 or y=8 at T=32 or T=33.\n\nThat is, at time T=32, y_{32} should not be 7 or 8.\n\nAt time T=33, y_{33} should not be 7 or 8.\n\nSince if we are on y=7 at T=32, collision; similarly at T=33.\n\nNow, from T=30, y=1.\n\nWe have actions at T=30, T=31, T=32, etc.\n\ny at T=32 depends on actions at T=30 and T=31.\n\nSimilarly, y at T=33 depends on actions at T=30,31,32.\n\nFirst, let's find possible to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nMinimal from y=1 to y=9 is 8 steps with all U, but we have constraints.\n\nTime: T=30, y=1.\n\nAfter k actions, y_{30+k} =1 + sum of Δy from t=30 to 30+k-1.\n\nWe want y_{30+H} =9 for some H.\n\nBut also need to be safe at each intermediate T.\n\nNow, the critical points are T=32 and T=33.\n\nAt T=32: y_{32} should not be 7 or 8.\n\nAt T=33: y_{33} should not be 7 or 8.\n\nSince we are going up, y increases, so we might be able to time it.\n\nFirst, let's see what y we can be at T=32.\n\nT=32 is time 32, which is ΔT=4 from t_1=28, but from current.\n\nAt T=30, y=1.\n\nAction a_{30}: determines y_{31}\n\nThen a_{31}: determines y_{32}\n\ny_{32} = y_{31} + Δy_{31} = (y_{30} + Δy_{30}) + Δy_{31} = 1 + d30 + d31\n\nd30 and d31 in {-1,0,1}, so y_{32} = 1 + d30 + d31, from 1-1-1= -1? But y min 0, so y_{32} >=0.\n\nPossible: if both D: y_{31} =1 + (-1) =0? y_{30}=1, a30: if D, y_{31}=1-1=0\n\nThen a31: if D, y_{32}=0-1= -1, but y=0 min, so y_{32} cannot be negative, must be at least 0.\n\nSimilarly, max: both U, y_{32}=1+1+1=3\n\ny_{30}=1\n\na30: U, y_{31}=2\n\na31: U, y_{32}=3\n\na30: U, a31: S, y_{31}=2, y_{32}=2+0=2\n\na30: U, a31: D, y_{31}=2, y_{32}=2-1=1\n\na30: S, y_{31}=1+0=1\n\na31: U, y_{32}=1+1=2\n\na31: S, y_{32}=1+0=1\n\na31: D, y_{32}=1-1=0\n\na30: D, y_{31}=1-1=0\n\na31: U, y_{32}=0+1=1\n\na31: S, y_{32}=0+0=0\n\na31: D, y_{32}=0-1= -1 invalid, so not possible, y_{32} >=0.\n\nSo possible y_{32}: min 0, max 3.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- If a30=D, a31=D: y31=0, y32= -1 invalid, so cannot have two downs from y=1.\n\na30=D: y31=0\n\nThen a31: if D, y32=0-1= -1 invalid, so a31 cannot be D when y=0.\n\nSimilarly, if y=0, action D not allowed? But the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if y_t=0, a_t=D, then y_{t+1}= -1, but since it must be in [0,9], probably it stays or something, but the rule says y_{t+1} in [0,9], so I think if action would take it out, it might not move or error, but to be safe, assume that we cannot go below 0, so if y_t=0 and a_t=D, y_{t+1}=0.\n\nSimilarly for y=9, U not possible.\n\nIn the update: \"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\", so it is clipped or something, but not specified. Probably, we should assume that if action would take it out of bounds, it stays, so Δy=0 effectively.\n\nTo avoid complication, since from y=1, if we go down, to y=0, then from y=0, D would do nothing, similarly.\n\nBut in this case, for y_{32}, from y_{30}=1.\n\nPossible actions:\n\n- a30: D, then y31=0 (since 1-1=0)\n\nThen a31: if D, y32=0 (since cannot go below)\n\nIf S, y32=0\n\nIf U, y32=1\n\n- a30: S, y31=1\n\na31: D, y32=0\n\nS, y32=1\n\nU, y32=2\n\n- a30: U, y31=2\n\na31: D, y32=1\n\nS, y32=2\n\nU, y32=3\n\nSo possible (y31, y32) pairs:\n\n- (0,0) if a30=D, a31=D or S\n\n- (0,1) if a30=D, a31=U\n\n- (1,0) if a30=S, a31=D\n\n- (1,1) if a30=S, a31=S\n\n- (1,2) if a30=S, a31=U\n\n- (2,1) if a30=U, a31=D\n\n- (2,2) if a30=U, a31=S\n\n- (2,3) if a30=U, a31=U\n\nThus y32 can be 0,1,2,3.\n\nAt T=32, we need y32 not 7 or 8, which is fine since max is 3, so no issue. y32 <=3 <7, so always safe at T=32, since not on y=7 or 8.\n\nSimilarly, at T=33: y33 should not be 7 or 8.\n\ny33 depends on previous.\n\ny33 = y32 + Δy_{32}\n\ny32 from above can be 0,1,2,3.\n\nThen y33 = y32 + d32\n\nd32 in {-1,0,1}, so y33 from min y32-1 to y32+1.\n\nSince y32 <=3, y33 <=4 if y32=3 and U, y33=4; or if y32=3, S, y33=3; D, y33=2.\n\nSimilarly, min y33=0 if y32=0 and D or S, or y32=1 and D, etc.\n\nBut y33 <=4 <7, so y33 cannot be 7 or 8, since max possible is 4.\n\nThus at T=33, y33 <=4 <7, so not on y=7 or 8, so safe.\n\nTherefore, from T=30 onwards, with y=1, we can move up freely, no collisions possible because the dangerous times for y=7 and 8 are T=32 and 33, but by then we are still low, y<=4, so no issue.\n\nThen we can go up to y=9.\n\nBut we need to avoid y=1 later, since occupied from T=40.\n\nBut T=40 is far, we can reach y=9 before that.\n\nFirst, from T=30, y=1, we need to go to y=9.\n\nNumber of up moves needed: net +8, since from y=1 to y=9, difference 8.\n\nEach U gives +1, so minimum 8 actions if all U.\n\nStart: T=30, y=1\n\nAfter action a30, y31\n\na31, y32\n\n...\n\nAfter a37, y38\n\nIf all U:\n\na30: U, y31=2\n\na31: U, y32=3\n\na32: U, y33=4\n\na33: U, y34=5\n\na34: U, y35=6\n\na35: U, y36=7\n\na36: U, y37=8\n\na37: U, y38=9\n\nNow, at which times? We need to check for collision during T=30 to T=37, since at T=38 we reach y=9 safe.\n\nAt T=30: we are at y=1, which is safe, as established.\n\nT=31: y=2, freeway 2. Is it occupied? Freeway 2 only occupied at T=30, not at T=31, so safe.\n\nT=32: y=3, freeway 3, occupied only at T=30, not T=32, safe.\n\nT=33: y=4, freeway 4, occupied only T=30, safe.\n\nT=34: y=5, freeway 5, occupied only T=30, safe.\n\nT=35: y=6, freeway 6, occupied only T=30, safe.\n\nT=36: y=7, freeway 7. Is it occupied? Freeway 7 occupied at T=32 and 33, not at T=36? T=36 is later, ΔT from t_1=28, T=36, ΔT=8.\n\nFreeway 7: car span, at T, for first car: [-35 +6ΔT, -24 +6ΔT]\n\nAt ΔT=8, T=36, A= -35 +48=13, B= -24+48=24, so [13,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSecond car never at 0.\n\nSimilarly, T=37: y=8, freeway 8, similarly, at T=37, ΔT=9, A= -35 +54=19, B= -24+54=30, [19,30], 0 not in, safe.\n\nT=38: y=9, safe.\n\nNow, what about y=1 later? We are not on y=1 after T=30 until we go down, but we are going up, so no issue.\n\nIn this sequence, we reach y=9 at T=38.\n\nBut H is the number of turns from t_1=28.\n\nWe have actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-1, and y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nt_1=28.\n\nIn the above, we have actions from T=30 to T=37? Let's list the turns.\n\nFirst, we need to get to T=30 with y=1.\n\nEarlier, at T=28 and T=29, we need to go down to reach y=1 at T=30.\n\nThen from T=30 to T=37, actions to go up.\n\nSequence:\n\nAt T=28: action a28, to set y29\n\nT=29: a29, to set y30=1\n\nThen T=30: a30, to set y31\n\n...\n\nUp to T=37: a37, to set y38=9\n\nSo actions at T=28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37.\n\nThat's 10 actions? T from 28 to 37 inclusive is 10 turns? Let's index.\n\nActions: at times t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nStart t=0: T=28\n\nt=1: T=29\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions, at time t_1 + H.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn this case, with above, actions at T=28 to T=37: that's 10 actions (28,29,30,...,37).\n\nT=28 to T=37 is 10 turns? Number of actions: from T=28 to T=37 inclusive is 10 actions.\n\nAfter 10 actions, at T=28+10=38, y=9.\n\nH=10.\n\nBut we can reach faster? Minimal H is 6, but we had to go down first, so it takes more.\n\nFrom T=30, y=1 to y=9, we used 8 actions (T=30 to 37), but T=30 to 37 is 8 actions? Action at T=30 sets y31, ..., T=37 sets y38.\n\nNumber of actions from T=30 to T=37: 8 actions, to go from y31 to y38, but y at T=30 is 1, after a30 y31, ..., after a37 y38=9.\n\nFrom y=1 to y=9, 8 steps with all U.\n\nBut including the initial downs.\n\nTotal actions: a28 and a29 to go down to y=1 at T=30.\n\nThen a30 to a37 to go up to y=9 at T=38.\n\nSo actions at T=28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37: that's 10 actions.\n\nH=10, and y_{38}=9.\n\nNow, is there a faster way?\n\nFor example, instead of going down to y=1, can we go to another safe position at T=30?\n\nEarlier, only y=1 is safe and achievable.\n\ny=0 is safe, but from y=3, with two downs, we can reach y=1, but not y=0? From y=3, with a28=D, y29=2; a29=D, y30=1. Cannot reach y=0 in two steps from y=3? y=3 to y=0 in two steps: need net -3, but each step max -1, so min y30=1, as above. So y=0 not possible at T=30.\n\nSimilarly, y=7,8,9 not possible.\n\nSo only choice is to be at y=1 at T=30.\n\nThus, must take two downs at start.\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut in the up phase, we took 8 steps, but since we start low, and go up slowly, but we can go faster? No, from y=1 to y=9, min 8 up moves.\n\nBut we could have some up moves earlier, but at T=28 and T=29, we have to go down, so we lose progress.\n\nPerhaps we can stay or something, but at T=30, we must be at y=1, so no choice.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps we can be at a different y at T=30, but only y=1 is safe, others are occupied.\n\nUnless we can avoid being on the freeway at T=30 by being at y=0 or y=9, but y=0 not reachable, y=9 too far.\n\nSo no, must be at y=1 at T=30.\n\nThen proceed up.\n\nBut in the up sequence, we can go faster if we start from higher, but we start from low.\n\nPerhaps we can have actions that make us skip the dangerous times later, but in this case, for y=7 and 8, dangerous at T=32,33, but as we saw, at T=32 we are at y<=3, T=33 y<=4, so no issue, and we can go up.\n\nBut we can reach y=9 earlier? In the sequence above, we reach at T=38.\n\nT=38 is 10 turns after start? From T=28 to T=38 is 10 steps? Let's clarify.\n\nTime: at T=28, before action, y=3.\n\nAfter a28, at T=29, y new.\n\n...\n\nAfter a37, at T=38, y=9.\n\nActions taken at T=28 to T=37, that's 10 actions: indices 28 to 37 inclusive, 10 times.\n\nH=10.\n\nBut we might reach earlier if we go up faster, but from y=1 to y=9, min 8 moves, so with the two downs, it's 10.\n\nPerhaps we can go down only one step or something, but at T=30, if y=2, it is occupied, collision.\n\nFor example, if we do a28=D, then at T=29 y=2.\n\nAt T=29, y=2, freeway 2: at T=29, is it occupied? Freeway 2 occupied only at T=30, not at T=29, so safe.\n\nBut then at T=29, we need to set a29 so that at T=30 we are safe.\n\nBut at T=30, if y=2, it is occupied, collision.\n\nIf we go down to y=1, safe.\n\nIf we go up, to y=3, but y=3 occupied at T=30.\n\nOr stay, y=2, occupied.\n\nSo only down to y=1.\n\nNo other choice.\n\nThus, the sequence must include two downs at start.\n\nThen from there, go up.\n\nIn the up phase, we can go directly, as above.\n\nBut H=10.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 before T=38.\n\nFor example, from y=1 at T=30, if we go up faster, but we need 8 up moves, so earliest at T=38.\n\nUnless we start from higher, but we start from low.\n\nAnother thought: at T=28 and T=29, we have to do D, but after that, we can go up.\n\nBut perhaps we can do the downs later, but no, because at T=30 we must be safe, so we need to be at y=1 at T=30.\n\nIf we stay at T=28, y=3, then at T=29 y=3, then at T=30 y=3, but y=3 occupied at T=30, collision.\n\nIf we go up at T=28, to y=4 at T=29, then at T=29 y=4, safe, then at T=30, if we go down to y=3 or stay y=4 or up y=5, all occupied except if we could go to y=1, but not possible in one step.\n\nFrom y=4 at T=29, possible a29: D to y=3, but y=3 occupied T=30; S to y=4, occupied; U to y=5, occupied. All bad.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down at T=28 to y=2 at T=29, then at T=29 y=2, safe, then a29: D to y=1, safe at T=30; or S to y=2, occupied; U to y=3, occupied. Only D to y=1 is safe.\n\nSo indeed, only by going to y=1 at T=30 can we avoid collision.\n\nThus, no choice.\n\nSo actions: T=28: D\n\nT=29: D\n\nThen T=30 to T=37: all U\n\nBut T=30 to T=37 is 8 actions, plus T=28 and T=29, total 10 actions.\n\nNow, output the sequence.\n\nBut let's confirm the times.\n\nAlso, in the sequence, we need to specify for each turn.\n\nNow, at T=37, we set y38=9, which is the goal.\n\nH=10.\n\nBut is there a way with less than 10?\n\nFor example, if we can reach y=9 earlier by not going all the way down, but we can't.\n\nPerhaps we can go up immediately after, but with fewer moves, but no.\n\nAnother idea: since at T=32 and 33, y=7 and 8 are occupied, but we are not there yet, so no issue.\n\nBut we can go slower or faster to avoid, but in this case, we are below.\n\nPerhaps from y=1, we can go to higher y faster by using multiple up, but we are already using all U.\n\nUnless we can skip some levels, but no, we move one step at a time.\n\nSo I think 10 is minimal.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach in 9 turns.\n\nSuppose H=9, then y_{28+9}=y_{37}=9.\n\nBut y_{28}=3, so need net +6 in 9 actions? Sum of Δy from t=28 to 36 (since actions at t=28 to 36, y at t=37).\n\nActions at t=28 to t=28+H-1, after H actions, y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nFor H=9, actions t=28 to 36, y_{37}=9.\n\ny_{37} = y_{28} + sum_{k=28}^{36} Δy_k, no.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo y_{29} = y_{28} + Δy_{28}\n\ny_{30} = y_{29} + Δy_{29} = y_{28} + Δy_{28} + Δy_{29}\n\n...\n\ny_{37} = y_{28} + Δy_{28} + Δy_{29} + ... + Δy_{36}\n\nSince actions from k=28 to 36, that's 9 actions, Δy for k=28 to 36.\n\ny_{37} = 3 + sum_{k=28}^{36} Δy_k\n\nSet equal to 9, so sum_{k=28}^{36} Δy_k = 6.\n\nEach Δy in {-1,0,1}, so sum=6 with 9 terms, possible, for example, six U and three S, or seven U and two D minus one, etc., but net +6.\n\nBut we need to avoid collision at T=30.\n\nAt T=30, y_{30} must be 1, as before.\n\ny_{30} = y_{28} + Δy_{28} + Δy_{29} = 3 + d28 + d29\n\nSet y_{30}=1, so 3 + d28 + d29 =1, thus d28 + d29 = -2, so both must be D, d28=-1, d29=-1.\n\nThen y_{30}=1.\n\nNow, we need y_{37}=9.\n\ny_{37} = y_{30} + sum_{k=30}^{36} Δy_k = 1 + sum_{k=30}^{36} d_k\n\nSet to 9, so sum_{k=30}^{36} d_k = 8.\n\nk from 30 to 36 inclusive, that's 7 actions (30,31,32,33,34,35,36).\n\nSum of 7 terms, each in {-1,0,1}, max sum 7, min -7.\n\nWe need sum=8, which is impossible since max 7.\n\n7 actions, each at most +1, so y_{37} <= 1 + 7 = 8 <9, cannot reach y=9 with 7 actions from y=1.\n\ny_{37} = y_{30} + Δy_{30} + ... + Δy_{36}\n\ny_{30}=1, then after Δy_{30}, y_{31}=1 + d30\n\n...\n\nAfter Δy_{36}, y_{37} = y_{36} + d36\n\nBut y_{37} = 1 + d30 + d31 + d32 + d33 + d34 + d35 + d36\n\nThat's 7 terms, each d from -1 to 1, so y_{37} <= 1+7=8, cannot be 9.\n\nThus, with H=9, y_{37} <= 3 + (net from actions) but actions from 28 to 36, 9 actions, y_{37} = 3 + sum_{k=28}^{36} d_k\n\nSince d28 and d29 must be -1 each, so sum_{k=28}^{36} d_k = d28 + d29 + sum_{k=30}^{36} d_k = -1 + -1 + sum_{30-36} d_k = -2 + S, where S = sum_{30-36} d_k <=7, so y_{37} <= 3 + (-2 +7) = 3+5=8 <9.\n\nSimilarly, min 3 + (-2 + (-7)) = 3-9= -6, but clipped, but max is 8.\n\nSo cannot reach y=9 with H=9; need at least H=10.\n\nWith H=10, actions from 28 to 37, y_{38} = 3 + sum_{k=28}^{37} d_k\n\nd28 and d29 = -1 each, so sum_{28-37} d_k = d28 + d29 + sum_{30-37} d_k = -1 + -1 + sum_{30-37} d_k\n\nsum_{30-37} d_k is 8 terms, max 8.\n\ny_{38} = 3 + [ -2 + sum_{30-37} d_k ] <= 3 + (-2 +8) = 9, equality if all d_k=1 for k=30 to37.\n\nSimilarly, min less, but we can achieve y_{38}=9 with all U from T=30 on.\n\nThus H=10 is minimal.\n\nNow, back to the sequence.\n\nAt T=28: action D, so y_{29} = 3 + (-1) = 2? y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, Δy for D is -1.\n\ny_{28}=3, a_{28}=D, so y_{29} = 3 + (-1) = 2\n\nThen at T=29: a_{29}=D, y_{30} = 2 + (-1) = 1\n\nThen T=30: a_{30}=U, y_{31} = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nT=31: U, y_{32} = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nT=32: U, y_{33} = 3 + 1 = 4\n\nT=33: U, y_{34} = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nT=34: U, y_{35} = 5 + 1 = 6\n\nT=35: U, y_{36} = 6 + 1 = 7\n\nT=36: U, y_{37} = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nT=37: U, y_{38} = 8 + 1 = 9\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt T=28: y=3, freeway 3, not occupied (only T=30), safe.\n\nT=29: y=2, freeway 2, not occupied (only T=30), safe.\n\nT=30: y=1, freeway 1, not occupied (occupied later), safe.\n\nT=31: y=2, freeway 2, not occupied, safe.\n\nT=32: y=3, freeway 3, not occupied, safe.\n\nT=33: y=4, freeway 4, not occupied, safe.\n\nT=34: y=5, freeway 5, not occupied, safe.\n\nT=35: y=6, freeway 6, not occupied, safe.\n\nT=36: y=7, freeway 7, not occupied at T=36 (as earlier, span [13,24] for first car, etc.), safe.\n\nT=37: y=8, freeway 8, not occupied at T=37, safe.\n\nT=38: y=9, safe, no freeway.\n\nAll good.\n\nIn the output, we need to list actions from turn t_1=28 to t_1 + H -1 =28+9=37? H=10, actions from t=28 to 37, that is 10 actions.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =28 +10 -1=37.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in the sequence, for each turn, the action.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 28: D\n\nTurn 29: D\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nTurn 33: U\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nIn the answer format, it should be like:\n\n\\boxed{  \nTurn 28: D  \nTurn 29: D  \nTurn 30: U  \nTurn 31: U  \nTurn 32: U  \nTurn 33: U  \nTurn 34: U  \nTurn 35: U  \nTurn 36: U  \nTurn 37: U  \n}\n\nBut H=10, and we have 10 actions.\n\nIs there a shorter way? I don't think so, as we saw.\n\nPerhaps we can use some stay actions to save time, but no, because we need to go up, and stay would not help, it would increase H.\n\nFor example, if we stay somewhere, y doesn't increase, so it takes more actions to reach y=9.\n\nThus, minimal H is 10.\n\nIn the sequence above, we used all U after the downs, which is efficient.\n\nIn the car states, for freeway 6,7,8 there were multiple cars, but we handled.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 6, there was a second car (48,37,right,12) but it never near 0, so fine.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 28\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 10. The sequence of actions must ensure that the player is not on a freeway where a car occupies \\(x = 0\\) at the same turn.\n\n### Analysis of Car Occupancy at \\(x = 0\\)\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: Occupied at turns 40, 41, 42, 43.\n- **Freeway 2 (y=2)**: Occupied only at turn 30.\n- **Freeway 3 (y=3)**: Occupied only at turn 30.\n- **Freeway 4 (y=4)**: Occupied only at turn 30.\n- **Freeway 5 (y=5)**: Occupied only at turn 30.\n- **Freeway 6 (y=6)**: Occupied only at turn 30 (from the first car; the second car never covers \\(x=0\\)).\n- **Freeway 7 (y=7)**: Occupied at turns 32 and 33.\n- **Freeway 8 (y=8)**: Occupied at turns 32 and 33.\n\nAt turn 30, freeways \\(y=2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\) are occupied, so the player must avoid these positions at turn 30. The only safe and reachable position at turn 30 is \\(y=1\\) (since \\(y=0\\) is not reachable from \\(y=3\\) in two moves, and higher y-values are occupied or unreachable).\n\nTo achieve \\(y=1\\) at turn 30:\n- At turn 28: Move down (D), so \\(y_{29} = 3 - 1 = 2\\).\n- At turn 29: Move down (D), so \\(y_{30} = 2 - 1 = 1\\).\n\nFrom \\(y=1\\) at turn 30, the player can move up to reach \\(y=9\\) without encountering collisions:\n- The dangerous turns for \\(y=7\\) and \\(y=8\\) are 32 and 33, but by turn 33, the player is at \\(y \\leq 4\\) (due to the slow ascent from \\(y=1\\)), so no collision occurs.\n- After turn 33, all freeways are safe except \\(y=1\\) at later turns (40-43), but the player is moving upward and reaches \\(y=9\\) before turn 40.\n\nThe sequence to reach \\(y=9\\) in minimal turns:\n- Actions at turns 28 and 29: Down (D) to reach \\(y=1\\) at turn 30.\n- Actions at turns 30 to 37: Up (U) to increase y-position stepwise to 9 by turn 38.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{t}\\}_{t=28}^{37}\\) is as follows, with \\(H = 10\\):\n\n- Turn 28: D (move down to \\(y=2\\) at turn 29)\n- Turn 29: D (move down to \\(y=1\\) at turn 30)\n- Turn 30: U (move up to \\(y=2\\) at turn 31)\n- Turn 31: U (move up to \\(y=3\\) at turn 32)\n- Turn 32: U (move up to \\(y=4\\) at turn 33)\n- Turn 33: U (move up to \\(y=5\\) at turn 34)\n- Turn 34: U (move up to \\(y=6\\) at turn 35)\n- Turn 35: U (move up to \\(y=7\\) at turn 36)\n- Turn 36: U (move up to \\(y=8\\) at turn 37)\n- Turn 37: U (move up to \\(y=9\\) at turn 38)\n\nAt turn 38, \\(y_{38} = 9\\), reaching the goal. Collisions are avoided as:\n- At turn 30: \\(y=1\\) is safe (freeway 1 not occupied until turn 40).\n- At turns 32 and 33: Player is at \\(y=3\\) and \\(y=4\\), below \\(y=7\\) and \\(y=8\\), so no collision with freeways 7 or 8.\n- All other turns are safe as freeways are unoccupied at the respective positions and times.\n\nNo shorter sequence is possible, as \\(H=9\\) would require reaching \\(y=9\\) by turn 37, but after the necessary down moves to avoid turn 30 collision, only 7 moves are available from turn 30 to 36, insufficient to reach \\(y=9\\) from \\(y=1\\) (maximum \\(y_{37} = 8\\)).\n\n\\boxed{  \nTurn 28: D  \nTurn 29: D  \nTurn 30: U  \nTurn 31: U  \nTurn 32: U  \nTurn 33: U  \nTurn 34: U  \nTurn 35: U  \nTurn 36: U  \nTurn 37: U  \n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0, 0) at turn t_1 = 30. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T (between 1 and 8) and 0 is within the span of a car on that freeway at that exact turn T.\n\nImportantly, when moving to a new row, you're not on that row until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, you're on y at turn T, and on y+1 at turn T+1. So you only check for collision on the row you're currently on at that turn.\n\nCars move continuously. For left-moving cars, span decreases; for right-moving, span increases. All cars here are right-moving, based on the data.\n\nList the car states:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, (-48, -59, right, 3). Head at -48, tail at -59? That seems backwards. Direction is right, so for right-moving, head should be greater than tail. Here head is -48, tail is -59, and since it's right-moving, the span should be from tail to head, I think. Let me check the update rule.\n\nFrom the update: for right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)], with initial [τ, h]. But in the table, it says \"head h, tail τ\", so for freeway 1, head = -48, tail = -59. But since direction is right, and head should be the front, so if it's moving right, head should be on the right, so if tail is -59 and head is -48, that means tail is at -59, head at -48, so the car is from -59 to -48, length 11, moving right with speed 3.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 1: car with tail τ = -59, head h = -48, direction right, speed s=3. So at turn t_1=30, span is [τ, h] = [-59, -48].\n\nThen at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-59 + 3(T-30), -48 + 3(T-30)]\n\nCollision if player is on freeway 1 at turn T and 0 is in [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nNow freeway 2: (48, 37, right, 12). Head=48, tail=37? That would be tail at 37, head at 48, so span [37,48] at t_1, moving right speed 12.\n\nBut head=48, tail=37, if tail is left and head is right for right-moving, yes.\n\nFreeway 3,4,5 same as freeway 2: each has one car (48,37,right,12)\n\nFreeway 6: two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst car: head=48, tail=37, so [37,48]\n\nSecond car: head=0, tail=-11, so [-11,0] at t_1.\n\nBoth speed 12, right-moving.\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nFirst: head=-48, tail=-59, so [-59,-48]\n\nSecond: head=0, tail=-11, so [-11,0]\n\nSpeed 6 for both.\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nPlayer starts at y=0 at t_1=30. y=0 is not a freeway, so no cars there, so no collision at y=0. The freeways are from y=1 to y=8.\n\nGoal is to reach y=9, which is also not a freeway, so once there, no cars.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 from y=0, minimal turns, so probably want to go up as much as possible, but avoid collisions when on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nEach U move increases y by 1, D decreases, S stays.\n\nSince we start at 0 and need to go to 9, we need at least 9 U moves, and possibly some S or D to wait, but D would make us go down, which might not be efficient, so probably minimal H is at least 9, but with waiting, it might be more.\n\nBut we can use S to wait for cars to pass.\n\nNow, since cars move, we need to find when it's safe to be on each row.\n\nThe player moves at each turn, and after moving, we check for collision on the new y.\n\nAt turn T, player chooses action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, we have position (0, y_{T+1}), and if y_{T+1} is between 1 and 8, we check if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T+1.\n\nThe collision is checked at the turn when player is on that row.\n\nSo for each freeway, we need to know when 0 is covered by a car on that row at that turn.\n\nLet t_1 = 30.\n\nFor each freeway i, and each car on it, we have the span as a function of T.\n\nThen 0 is in span if min_span <= 0 <= max_span.\n\nSince cars are right-moving, for each car, the span is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nAnd 0 in span if τ + s(T-t_1) <= 0 <= h + s(T-t_1)\n\nNow let's list for each freeway, the times when it is unsafe, i.e., when 0 is covered.\n\nStart with freeway 1: one car, τ=-59, h=-48, s=3, t_1=30\n\nSpan at T: [-59 + 3(T-30), -48 + 3(T-30)]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 3(T-30) <= 0 <= -48 + 3(T-30)\n\nLet k = T - 30, so relative turn.\n\nThen -59 + 3k <= 0 <= -48 + 3k\n\nFirst inequality: -59 + 3k <= 0 => 3k <= 59 => k <= 59/3 = 19.666, so k <= 19 since k integer? k = T-30, integer.\n\n-59 + 3k <= 0 => 3k <= 59 => k <= 59/3 = 19 + 2/3, so for k <= 19, since k integer, 3*19=57, -59+57=-2 <=0, 3*20=60, -59+60=1>0, so -59+3k <=0 for k <=19.\n\n-59 + 3k <= 0 when 3k <=59, k<=19.666, so k<=19.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 <= -48 + 3k => 48 <= 3k => k >= 16.\n\n0 <= -48 + 3k => 48 <= 3k => k >= 16.\n\nBecause 3*16=48, -48+48=0, so 0<=0 true.\n\nFor k=15, 3*15=45, -48+45=-3 <0, so 0 <= -3 false.\n\nSo k >=16.\n\nThus 0 in span when k >=16 and k <=19, so for T = 30 + k, k=16,17,18,19, so T=46,47,48,49.\n\nk from 16 to 19 inclusive, T=46,47,48,49.\n\nSo freeway 1 is unsafe at turns 46,47,48,49.\n\nNow freeway 2: one car, τ=37, h=48, s=12\n\nSpan at T: [37 + 12(k), 48 + 12(k)] with k=T-30\n\n0 in span: 37 +12k <=0 <=48 +12k\n\nFirst, 37+12k <=0? 12k <= -37, but k>=0, 12k >=0, 37+12k >=37>0, so left side always positive, never <=0. So 37+12k <=0 false for all k>=0. Thus 0 never in span. So freeway 2 is always safe? 37+12k, min at k=0 is 37>0, so 0 < 37 <= span min, so 0 not in span. Similarly, freeways 3,4,5 same, so always safe.\n\nFreeway 3,4,5 have the same car: (48,37,right,12), which is head=48, tail=37, so span [37,48] at k=0, moving right, so [37+12k,48+12k], all >0 for k>=0, so 0 never covered. Safe at all times.\n\nNow freeway 6: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12), same as above, span [37+12k,48+12k], never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12), head=0, tail=-11, so at t_1, span [-11,0]\n\nThen at T, span [ -11 +12k, 0 +12k ] = [-11+12k, 12k]\n\n0 in span if -11+12k <=0 <=12k\n\nFirst: -11+12k <=0 => 12k <=11 => k <=11/12=0.916, so k<=0 since k integer >=0? k=0: -11+0=-11<=0 true, k=1: -11+12=1>0 false. So only for k=0.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <=12k, which is true for k>=0.\n\nBut for k=0: -11+0 = -11 <=0 <=0, 0<=0 true.\n\nFor k=1: -11+12=1 <=0? 1<=0 false, so only k=0.\n\nk=0 is T=t_1=30.\n\nSo at T=30, 0 is covered by this car.\n\nBut player is not on freeway 6 at T=30, because at T=30, player is at y=0, not on freeway.\n\nCollision only if player is on that freeway at that turn.\n\nFor freeway 6, unsafe when 0 covered, which is only at T=30.\n\nBut at T=30, if player were on y=6, it would be unsafe, but player is at y=0, so no issue.\n\nFor other times, safe.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,6), tail=-59, head=-48, span at k=0: [-59,-48]\n\nAt T: [-59 +6k, -48 +6k]\n\n0 in span if -59+6k <=0 <= -48+6k\n\nFirst: -59+6k <=0 => 6k <=59 => k <= 59/6=9.833, so k<=9\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48+6k => 48 <=6k => k>=8\n\nSo k>=8 and k<=9.\n\nk=8: -59+48= -11 <=0 <= -48+48=0, 0<=0 true.\n\nk=9: -59+54= -5 <=0 <= -48+54=6, 0<=6 true.\n\nk=10: -59+60=1 <=0? false.\n\nSo unsafe at k=8,9, T=38,39.\n\nSecond car on freeway 7: (0,-11,right,6), head=0, tail=-11, span at k=0: [-11,0]\n\nAt T: [-11+6k, 0+6k] = [-11+6k, 6k]\n\n0 in span if -11+6k <=0 <=6k\n\nFirst: -11+6k <=0 => 6k <=11 => k<=11/6=1.833, so k<=1\n\nSecond: 0<=6k, k>=0\n\nSo for k=0: -11<=0<=0 true\n\nk=1: -11+6=-5<=0<=6 true\n\nk=2: -11+12=1<=0? false\n\nSo unsafe at k=0 and k=1, T=30 and 31.\n\nBut at T=30 and 31, for this car.\n\nNow for freeway 7, unsafe if either car covers 0.\n\nSo at T=30: first car not cover (k=0, span [-59,-48], not include 0), second car covers at T=30.\n\nAt T=31: second car at k=1, span [-11+6= -5, 6], 0 in it? -5<=0<=6 yes.\n\nFirst car at k=1, span [-59+6=-53, -48+6=-42], not include 0.\n\nAt T=38: k=8, first car span [-59+48= -11, -48+48=0], 0 covered.\n\nSecond car at k=8, span [-11+48=37, 48], not include 0? -11+6*8=-11+48=37, to 6*8=48, [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly T=39: k=9, first car span [-59+54= -5, -48+54=6], 0 in [-5,6].\n\nSecond car span [-11+54=43,54], 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 7 unsafe at:\n\n- From second car: T=30,31\n\n- From first car: T=38,39\n\nAlso, at other times? T=32 to 37: for example T=32, k=2, first car span [-59+12=-47,-42], not 0; second car span [-11+12=1,12], 0 not <=1? 0<=1 true but -11+12=1 <=0? 1<=0 false, so not covered.\n\nSimilarly, only T=30,31 from second car, and T=38,39 from first car.\n\nSo unsafe at T=30,31,38,39.\n\nBut T=30 and 31 are early, and player might not be on row 7 then.\n\nNow freeway 8: same as freeway 7, since same cars: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nSo identical to freeway 7: unsafe at T=30,31,38,39.\n\nNow summarize unsafe times for each row:\n\n- Row 1: unsafe at T=46,47,48,49\n\n- Row 2: always safe\n\n- Row 3: always safe\n\n- Row 4: always safe\n\n- Row 5: always safe\n\n- Row 6: unsafe only at T=30 (but at T=30, player not there)\n\n- Row 7: unsafe at T=30,31,38,39\n\n- Row 8: unsafe at T=30,31,38,39\n\nRows 2,3,4,5 always safe, no cars or cars never cover 0.\n\nRow 6 has a car that covers 0 only at T=30, but since player starts at T=30 on y=0, not on row 6, so if player is on row 6 at other times, it's safe.\n\nSimilarly, rows 7 and 8 unsafe only at specific times.\n\nPlayer starts at T=30, y=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nEach U increases y by 1, so to go from 0 to 9, we need exactly 9 U actions, but we can have S actions to wait, which increase time but not y.\n\nD actions decrease y, which would make us go down, so to minimize turns, we should avoid D, as it would require extra U to compensate, increasing H.\n\nSo minimal H should be 9 if we can go straight up without collision, but we need to check when we are on each row.\n\nSince we move one row per turn if we go up, but we can stay or go down, but down is bad.\n\nThe sequence: at each turn, we choose action, which determines y for next turn.\n\nAt turn T, we choose a_T, then y_{T+1} is set.\n\nThen at turn T+1, we are at y_{T+1}, and if 1<=y_{T+1}<=8, we check collision based on cars at turn T+1.\n\nStart at T=30, y=0.\n\nAfter action a_30, y_31 = y_30 + Δy_30.\n\ny_30 = 0.\n\nSo if a_30 = U, y_31=1\n\nIf S, y_31=0\n\nIf D, y_31=0? y must be in [0,9], y_31 = y_30 + Δy, if y_30=0 and D, Δy=-1, but y cannot be negative, so probably y_{t+1} is clamped, but the rule says y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so if at 0 and D, y_{t+1} should be 0, similarly at 9 and U, y=9.\n\nThe update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so if y_t=0 and a_t=D, Δy=-1, y_{t+1}= max(0, -1) =0.\n\nSimilarly, if y_t=9 and a_t=U, y_{t+1}= min(9,10)=9.\n\nBut in this case, from y=0, D or S both keep y=0, U moves to y=1.\n\nSimilarly, to y=9, U or S keep at 9, D to 8.\n\nBut we want to reach (0,9), so at some point y_H=9.\n\nNow, to minimize H, we should go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on a row when it is unsafe.\n\nSince rows 2,3,4,5 are always safe, we can be on them at any time without issue.\n\nRows 1,6,7,8 have unsafe times.\n\nRow 6 is only unsafe at T=30, which is past, so for T>30, row 6 is safe.\n\nRow 1 unsafe at T=46,47,48,49\n\nRow 7 and 8 unsafe at T=38,39 and also at T=30,31 but T=30,31 are early.\n\nNow, let's think about the path.\n\nPlayer starts at T=30, y=0.\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\nThe critical points are row 1,7,8.\n\nSince we have to go through each row, but we can delay or advance when we are on a row.\n\nFor example, if we go straight up from T=30:\n\nT=30: at y=0, choose a_30=U, then y_31=1\n\nAt T=31, position y=1, which is row 1? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=1 is row 1.\n\ny=1 is freeway 1.\n\nAt T=31, on row 1.\n\nIs row 1 safe at T=31?\n\nEarlier, row 1 unsafe only at T=46,47,48,49.\n\nT=31 is not in that, so safe.\n\nThen at T=31, choose a_31=U, y_32=2\n\nT=32, y=2, row 2, always safe.\n\nSimilarly, a_32=U, y_33=3, row 3 safe.\n\na_33=U, y_34=4, row 4 safe.\n\na_34=U, y_35=5, row 5 safe.\n\na_35=U, y_36=6, row 6.\n\nAt T=36, on row 6.\n\nRow 6 unsafe only at T=30, which is past, so safe.\n\nThen a_36=U, y_37=7, row 7.\n\nAt T=37, on row 7.\n\nRow 7 unsafe at T=30,31,38,39.\n\nT=37 not in, so safe.\n\nThen a_37=U, y_38=8, row 8.\n\nAt T=38, on row 8.\n\nRow 8 unsafe at T=38,39 (and 30,31 but past).\n\nT=38 is unsafe! Because row 8 unsafe at T=38,39.\n\nAt T=38, if on row 8, collision.\n\nIn this sequence, at T=38, y=8, which is row 8, and unsafe.\n\nProblem.\n\nThen we need to avoid that.\n\nAfter y_37=7 at T=37, instead of going up to y=8 at T=38, we could stay or go down, but going down is bad.\n\nAt T=37, on row 7, which is safe at T=37.\n\nIf we choose S at T=37, then y_38=7, still on row 7.\n\nAt T=38, on row 7, which is unsafe at T=38? Row 7 unsafe at T=38,39.\n\nT=38 is unsafe for row 7.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down to y=6, but y=6 is safe, but then we have to come back up.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nPerhaps we can go slower earlier.\n\nWe need to be on row 8 after T=39, since unsafe only at 38,39.\n\nSimilarly for row 7.\n\nRow 7 unsafe at T=38,39, so we should not be on row 7 at T=38 or T=39.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 unsafe at T=38,39, so not on row 8 at those times.\n\nAlso, row 1 unsafe at T=46-49, but that might not be an issue if we pass early.\n\nIn the straight up path, we reach row 7 at T=37, which is safe, but then we need to go to row 8.\n\nIf we go to row 8 at T=38, unsafe.\n\nWe can stay on row 7 at T=37, but then at T=38, if we stay, y_38=7, on row 7 at T=38, unsafe.\n\nIf we go down to y=6 at T=38, then y_38=6, on row 6 at T=38, which is safe, but then we are at y=6, need to go back up, which takes more turns.\n\nNot minimal.\n\nPerhaps we can delay reaching row 7.\n\nFor example, start later.\n\nCurrently, in straight up, we are at row 7 at T=37.\n\nT=37 is safe for row 7, but we can't move to row 8 immediately because T=38 unsafe.\n\nWe need to be on row 7 at a time when we can stay or move, but row 7 is unsafe at T=38,39, so we should avoid being on row 7 at T=38 or T=39.\n\nSimilarly for row 8.\n\nSo possible times to be on row 7: when not T=38 or 39, i.e., T<=37 or T>=40.\n\nSimilarly for row 8: T<=37 or T>=40.\n\nBut row 8 can only be reached from row 7 or row 9, but row 9 not freeway.\n\nTo be on row 8 at T, we must have been on row 7 or 9 at T-1, but row 9 not freeway, so from row 7 or row 8 (if stay) or row 9, but row 9 not, so from row 7 or row 8.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, let's think about the timeline.\n\nPlayer starts at T=30, y=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe unsafe periods for row 7 and 8 are T=38,39.\n\nSo we should not be on row 7 or 8 during T=38 or T=39.\n\nThat means at turn T=38, we should not have y=7 or 8.\n\nSimilarly at T=39, not y=7 or 8.\n\nAt T=38, position y_{38} should not be 7 or 8.\n\nSimilarly at T=39, y_{39} not 7 or 8.\n\ny_{t} is position at turn t.\n\nFor turn T=38, if y_{38} =7 or 8, collision if on that row.\n\nSimilarly for T=39.\n\nSo to avoid, at turn 38, y_{38} <=6 or >=9.\n\nSimilarly at turn 39, y_{39} <=6 or >=9.\n\nBut y=9 is the goal, so if we reach y=9 before, we are done.\n\nBut y=9 is not a freeway, so safe.\n\nIn minimal turns, we might reach early.\n\nSince rows 2-6 are safe except row 1 has later unsafe, but row 1 is low.\n\nFirst, let's see the earliest we can be at each row if we go straight up.\n\nFrom start:\n\nT=30: y=0\n\nAfter action, y_31 =1 if U, etc.\n\nAssume we go up asap.\n\nT=30: a=U, y_31=1\n\nT=31: y=1, a=U, y_32=2\n\nT=32: y=2, a=U, y_33=3\n\nT=33: y=3, a=U, y_34=4\n\nT=34: y=4, a=U, y_35=5\n\nT=35: y=5, a=U, y_36=6\n\nT=36: y=6, a=U, y_37=7\n\nT=37: y=7, a=U, y_38=8  → but at T=38, y=8 unsafe\n\nProblem at T=38.\n\nTo avoid, we need y_38 not 8, and not 7 if we were to be on 7, but at T=37 y=7, if we don't go U, we can do S or D.\n\nIf at T=37, y=7, we choose S, then y_38=7, but at T=38 on row 7, which is unsafe.\n\nIf choose D, y_38=6, then at T=38 on row 6, safe.\n\nBut then we are at y=6 at T=38, need to go up to y=9, which takes 3 more U, but we lost progress.\n\nThen from there, a_38=U, y_39=7, at T=39 on row 7, but row 7 unsafe at T=39, collision.\n\nIf at T=38 y=6, choose S, y_39=6, safe, but then at T=39 y=6, need to go up.\n\nThen a_39=U, y_40=7, at T=40 on row 7, safe since unsafe only up to T=39.\n\nThen a_40=U, y_41=8, at T=41 on row 8, safe.\n\nThen a_41=U, y_42=9, done.\n\nBut this took more turns.\n\nFrom start to y=6 at T=36, that took 6 turns (from T=30 to T=36, y from 0 to 6, 6 steps).\n\nT=30 to T=36: actions at T=30 to T=35, 6 actions, y from 0 to 6.\n\nThen at T=36, y=6.\n\nThen we did D or something, but in this case, at T=37, instead of U, we do D to y=6 at T=38? Let's sequence.\n\nBetter to start from T=36: at T=36, y=6 (after a_35=U from y=5).\n\nAt T=36, position y=6, row 6 safe.\n\nNow, if we choose a_36=U, y_37=7, at T=37 on row 7, safe (T=37 not unsafe).\n\nThen at T=37, if we choose a_37=S, y_38=7, but at T=38 on row 7, unsafe.\n\nIf a_37=U, y_38=8, at T=38 on row 8, unsafe.\n\nIf a_37=D, y_38=6, at T=38 on row 6, safe.\n\nThen at T=38, y=6, safe.\n\nThen we need to go to y=7, but at T=39, if we go U, y_39=7, at T=39 on row 7, unsafe.\n\nSo at T=38, y=6, we can choose S: a_38=S, y_39=6, at T=39 on row 6, safe.\n\nThen at T=39, y=6, choose U: a_39=U, y_40=7, at T=40 on row 7, safe (T=40>39).\n\nThen a_40=U, y_41=8, at T=41 on row 8, safe.\n\nThen a_41=U, y_42=9, done.\n\nNow, from start: to reach y=6 at T=36, that took 6 turns (actions at T=30 to T=35: U,U,U,U,U,U to y=1,2,3,4,5,6 at T=31,32,33,34,35,36)\n\nT=30: a=U, y_31=1\n\nT=31: a=U, y_32=2\n\n...\n\nT=35: a=U, y_36=6\n\nThen T=36: a=D? In above, at T=37 we need to be at y=7 to go down, but at T=36 y=6.\n\nAt T=36, y=6, we choose action for next.\n\nIn the sequence I thought: at T=37 we want to go down, but at T=36 we are at y=6.\n\nTo have y_37=7, we need a_36=U.\n\nBut if a_36=U, y_37=7.\n\nThen at T=37, to avoid being on row 7 or 8 at T=38, we can go down to y=6.\n\nSo a_37=D, then y_38=6 (since from y=7, D, y=6)\n\nThen at T=38, y=6, safe.\n\nThen to avoid T=39 unsafe, we stay: a_38=S, y_39=6, safe.\n\nThen a_39=U, y_40=7, safe at T=40.\n\na_40=U, y_41=8, safe at T=41.\n\na_41=U, y_42=9.\n\nTotal turns: from T=30 to T=41, that's 12 turns? Let's list actions.\n\nActions from t=30 to t=41.\n\ny at turn t.\n\nTurn t: position y_t, choose action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nStart: t=30, y_30=0\n\na_30: U, then y_31=1\n\na_31: U, y_32=2\n\na_32: U, y_33=3\n\na_33: U, y_34=4\n\na_34: U, y_35=5\n\na_35: U, y_36=6\n\na_36: U, y_37=7  // now at t=37, y=7\n\na_37: D, y_38=6  // from 7, down to 6\n\na_38: S, y_39=6  // stay at 6\n\na_39: U, y_40=7  // to 7 at t=40\n\na_40: U, y_41=8  // to 8 at t=41\n\na_41: U, y_42=9  // to 9 at t=42\n\nNow, at t=42, y=9, reached.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=30 to t=41, that's 12 actions? t=30 to t=41 inclusive is 12 turns, but actions at t=30 to t=41, 12 actions, H=12 turns.\n\nBut at t=42, position is set, but the last action is at t=41 to reach y_42=9.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-1, and y_{t_1 + H-1} =9? Let's see.\n\nStart at t_1=30, y_30=0.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, y_{t_1 + H} is the position.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nThe actions are {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, so after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nSet to 9.\n\nIn the sequence above, with actions from t=30 to t=41, that's 12 actions (t=0 to 11 relative, H=12), at turn t=30+12=42, y_42=9.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nPerhaps we don't need to go down; we can wait earlier.\n\nFor example, since row 1 has unsafe times later, but we pass row 1 early.\n\nIn the straight up, we are at row 7 at T=37, and row 8 at T=38 unsafe.\n\nBut if we can be at row 7 later, after T=39.\n\nBut to be at row 7, we need to get there from below.\n\nSince rows 2-6 are safe, we can spend time there.\n\nFor example, at some point before reaching row 7, we can stay for a few turns to delay.\n\nThen reach row 7 after T=39.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nLet's see when we can reach row 7 safely after T=39.\n\nRow 7 safe after T=39, i.e., T>=40.\n\nSimilarly for row 8.\n\nNow, from start, to go from y=0 to y=6, it takes 6 U actions, in 6 turns, reaching y=6 at T=36.\n\nThen from y=6, we can stay for some turns.\n\nThen go up to row 7 at T>=40.\n\nFor example, at T=36, y=6, we can choose S for a few turns.\n\nThen at some point go up.\n\nIf we go to row 7 at T=40, then we can go to row 8 at T=41, etc.\n\nLet's compute.\n\nTo be on row 7 at turn T, with T>=40.\n\nSince row 7 is safe for T>=40.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, from y=0, after k U actions, we are at y=k, but with turns.\n\nStart at T=30, y=0.\n\nAfter m actions, at turn T=30 + m, y = number of U minus number of D, but since no D, y = number of U actions.\n\nIf all U, after m U actions, at turn T=30 + m, y_m = m? Let's index.\n\nAfter 0 actions: T=30, y=0\n\nAfter 1 action: T=31, y=1 if U\n\n...\n\nAfter j U actions: at turn T=30 + j, y = j.\n\nBecause each U increases y by 1, and turn increases by 1.\n\nWith S, turn increases but y same.\n\nTo reach y=6, it takes at least 6 U actions, so at turn 30+6=36, y=6 if we go straight.\n\nThen to reach y=7, we need one more U.\n\nBut if we do U at turn T, then y_{T+1} = y_T +1.\n\nSo to have y at turn T be 7, we need to have done the U action at some turn before.\n\nFor example, to be at y=7 at turn T, that means at turn T, position is 7, which was set by action at T-1.\n\ny_T is determined by action at T-1.\n\ny_{T} = y_{T-1} + Δy_{T-1}\n\nSo to have y_T =7, we need that at turn T-1, we chose action such that y_T=7.\n\nNow, for row 7, we want to be on it at turn T with T not 38 or 39, so T<=37 or T>=40.\n\nSimilarly for row 8.\n\nIn the straight up, at T=36, y=6.\n\nIf we choose a_36=U, then y_37=7, so at turn 37, y=7.\n\nT=37 <=37, which is safe for row 7.\n\nBut then at T=37, to go to y=8, if we do U, y_38=8, T=38 unsafe.\n\nIf we do S at T=37, y_38=7, T=38 unsafe for row 7.\n\nIf we do D at T=37, y_38=6, then at T=38 y=6 safe.\n\nBut then we need to go back.\n\nTo avoid being on row 7 or 8 at T=38 and T=39, we can be at y=7 at T=37, which is safe, and then at T=37, instead of moving to 8 or staying, we go down to y=6 at T=38, so at T=38 we are on row 6, safe.\n\nThen at T=38, we can stay or go down, but we need to go up eventually.\n\nAt T=38, y=6, we can choose S, so y_39=6, at T=39 on row 6, safe.\n\nThen at T=39, U to y_40=7, at T=40 on row 7, safe.\n\nThen U to y_41=8, at T=41 on row 8, safe.\n\nU to y_42=9.\n\nAs before.\n\nBut we used a D action, which is inefficient.\n\nInstead, at T=36, y=6, we can choose to stay for a few turns.\n\nThen later go up to row 7 after T=39.\n\nFor example, at T=36, y=6, we choose S for a_36, then y_37=6.\n\nAt T=37, y=6, choose S, y_38=6.\n\nAt T=38, y=6, choose S, y_39=6.\n\nAt T=39, y=6, choose U, y_40=7, at T=40 on row 7, safe.\n\nThen a_40=U, y_41=8, at T=41 on row 8, safe.\n\na_41=U, y_42=9.\n\nSame as before, but without D, we used S to wait.\n\nH is same: actions from t=30 to t=41, 12 actions, reach at t=42.\n\nIn the first method with D, also 12 actions.\n\nBut with D, we had a D action, but H is same number of turns.\n\nIn both cases, 12 turns.\n\nBut we can reach earlier if we can be on row 8 at T=37 or something, but row 8 at T=37: is it safe?\n\nRow 8 unsafe at T=38,39, but T=37 is not listed, so should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 7 at T=37 safe.\n\nIn straight up, at T=37 y=7.\n\nIf we could go to y=8 at T=37? But to be at y=8 at T=37, we need to have y_37=8, which requires action at T=36 to set it.\n\nAt T=36, if y_36=7, then a_36=U, y_37=8.\n\nBut to have y_36=7, we need to be at y=7 at T=36.\n\nBut from start, to reach y=7 at T=36, that means 7 U actions in 6 turns? From T=30 to T=36.\n\nT=30: after a_30, y_31=1\n\nT=31: a_31, y_32=2\n\n...\n\nT=35: a_35, y_36=6\n\nTo have y_36=7, we need a_35 such that y_36=7, so at T=35, y_35 must be 6 or 7, but if y_35=6, a_35=U, y_36=7; if y_35=7, a_35=S or D, but y_35=7 not possible yet.\n\nEarliest y=6 at T=36, so y=7 at T=37.\n\nCannot be at y=7 before T=37 with all U.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at T=38 earliest.\n\nBut T=38 unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot reach y=8 before T=38.\n\nT=37 y=7, T=38 y=8 with U.\n\nBut T=38 unsafe for y=8.\n\nSo we must delay reaching y=8 until at least T=40.\n\nSimilarly for y=7, we can be at T=37 or later, but if at T=37, we have to deal with the move to y=8.\n\nTo have y at T=40 be 7, for example.\n\nThen go up from there.\n\nMinimal H: since we need 9 U actions, and we may have some S actions to wait.\n\nThe minimal number of turns is at least 9, but with waiting, more.\n\nIn the above, with 9 U and 3 S or something.\n\nIn the sequence with waiting: from start, 6 U to y=6 at T=36.\n\nThen 3 S at T=36,37,38: actions a_36=S, a_37=S, a_38=S, so y_37=6, y_38=6, y_39=6.\n\nThen a_39=U, y_40=7\n\na_40=U, y_41=8\n\na_41=U, y_42=9\n\nActions: U from t=30 to 35: 6 actions, then S at t=36,37,38: 3 actions, then U at t=39,40,41: 3 actions, total 12 actions, to t=41, y_42=9.\n\nNumber of U: 9, S:3, H=12.\n\nWith D, same H.\n\nBut we can reduce the waiting.\n\nNotice that we only need to avoid row 7 and 8 at T=38 and 39.\n\nWe can be on lower rows during that time.\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=6 or below at T=38 and 39.\n\nBut y=6 is safe.\n\nIn the straight up, we are at y=6 at T=36, which is before T=38.\n\nWe need to be at y<=6 at T=38 and T=39.\n\nAt T=38, y_38 <=6.\n\nSimilarly at T=39, y_39 <=6.\n\ny_38 is set by action at T=37.\n\ny_39 set by action at T=38.\n\nNow, from the start, we can go slower to the lower rows.\n\nFor example, we can stay at y=0 for some turns, but that might not help.\n\nSince rows 2-5 are safe, we can spend time there.\n\nBut row 1 has unsafe times at T=46-49, which is late, so if we are fast, we pass before that.\n\nIn our case, if we reach y=9 by T=42, T=42 is before 46, so row 1 unsafe not an issue.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTo minimize H, we should go up as fast as possible until we need to wait.\n\nSo from y=0 to y=6, 6 U, reaching y=6 at T=36.\n\nThen at T=36, y=6, we need to ensure that at T=38 and T=39, we are not on row 7 or 8, so y_38 and y_39 <=6.\n\ny_38 depends on actions from T=36 and T=37.\n\nAt T=36, we choose action.\n\nIf we choose S, y_37=6\n\nThen at T=37, if we choose S, y_38=6\n\nThen at T=38, if we choose S, y_39=6\n\nThen at T=39, U, y_40=7\n\netc.\n\nBut we have to wait until T=39 to go up.\n\nAt T=36, if we choose U, y_37=7, then at T=37, we must not stay or go up, because if S, y_38=7, unsafe; if U, y_38=8, unsafe; so must go down, y_38=6.\n\nThen at T=38, y=6, we can choose S, y_39=6, safe.\n\nThen at T=39, U, y_40=7, etc.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf at T=37, after y_37=7, we go down to y_38=6, but then at T=38 y=6, we can go up to y=7 at T=39? But at T=39, if y_39=7, on row 7, unsafe.\n\nSo we must stay at y=6 at T=39.\n\nThus, in both cases, we need to be at y=6 at T=38 and T=39.\n\nThen go up from T=39 or later.\n\nEarliest to start going up after T=39.\n\nAt T=39, we can be at y=6, choose U to y_40=7.\n\nThen U to y_41=8, U to y_42=9.\n\nSo we need to be at y=6 at T=39.\n\nNow, from start, how to be at y=6 at T=39.\n\nT=39, y_39=6.\n\ny_39 is set by actions from t=30 to 38.\n\nWe need exactly 6 U actions in the sequence from t=30 to 38, that's 9 actions? Turns from t=30 to t=38 for actions, 9 actions, to set y_39.\n\ny_39 is position at turn 39, set by action at t=38.\n\ny_{t} depends on previous actions.\n\nNumber of U actions determines y, but with turns.\n\nAfter k actions from t=30 to t=30+k-1, position at turn t=30+k.\n\nSet t=30.\n\nAfter m actions (at t=30 to t=30+m-1), position at turn t=30+m.\n\ny_{30+m} = number of U minus number of D in first m actions.\n\nSince y start at 0.\n\nWe want y_39 =6.\n\nTurn 39, which is t=30 +9, so after 9 actions (t=30 to t=38), y_39 is set.\n\ny_39 = sum of Δy from t=30 to t=38.\n\nEach Δy: U +1, D -1, S 0.\n\ny_39 = y_30 + sum_{t=30 to 38} Δy_t = 0 + sum Δy_t\n\nWe want y_39=6, so sum_{t=30 to 38} Δy_t =6\n\nSince each U contributes +1, D -1, S 0.\n\nThe number of U minus number of D must be 6, with 9 actions (t=30 to 38 inclusive is 9 actions).\n\nLet N_U, N_D, N_S, with N_U + N_D + N_S =9\n\nN_U - N_D =6\n\nThen from N_U + N_D + N_S=9, N_U - N_D=6, add: 2 N_U + N_S=15, subtract: 2 N_D + N_S=3.\n\nSince N_S >=0, 2 N_D <=3, so N_D <=1.5, so N_D=0 or 1.\n\nIf N_D=0, then N_U=6, N_S=3\n\nIf N_D=1, then N_U -1=6, N_U=7, and 7+1+N_S=9, N_S=1\n\nBut N_D=1, we have down action, which might not be efficient, but let's see.\n\nTo minimize time to reach y=9, we should not have D actions, as they decrease y, so we need more U later.\n\nFor minimal H to reach y=9, we should avoid D, so N_D=0.\n\nThen N_U=6, N_S=3 for the first 9 actions to have y_39=6.\n\nThen after that, we need to go to y=9, which requires 3 more U, with no waiting, but we may need to wait for row 7 and 8.\n\nAfter y_39=6, we can go up.\n\na_39=U, y_40=7\n\na_40=U, y_41=8\n\na_41=U, y_42=9\n\nAt T=40, on row 7, safe; T=41, row 8, safe; T=42, y=9.\n\nNow, with N_S=3 in the first part.\n\nBut where to place the S actions.\n\nWe need to reach y=6 at some point, but with S, we can insert S at any time before.\n\nBut we also have row 1 unsafe at later times, but since we are moving fast, we pass row 1 early.\n\nFor example, in the sequence, to have y_39=6 with 6 U and 3 S.\n\nWe can go up with some S in between.\n\nFor instance, at the beginning or later.\n\nBut since rows 2-5 are safe, we can stay there, but row 1 might be issue if we delay.\n\nRow 1 unsafe at T=46-49.\n\nIf we reach y=9 at T=42, before 46, no problem.\n\nSimilarly, if we stay lower, but we need to be at y=6 at T=39.\n\nT=39 <46, so row 1 is passed before unsafe times.\n\nIn fact, with all U, we are at row 1 at T=31, which is fine.\n\nSo we can insert the 3 S actions anywhere in the sequence from t=30 to t=38.\n\nFor example, we can have S at some turns to delay.\n\nBut to reach y=6 at T=39, we need exactly 6 U in the 9 actions.\n\nThe position increases only with U, so we need to have the 6th U at some point.\n\nEarliest to reach y=6 is at T=36 with 6 U and no S.\n\nBut with S, we reach later.\n\nBut we want to minimize H, so for the path to y=9, we should go up as fast as possible, but with the constraint to be at y=6 at T=39.\n\nSince we have to be at y=6 at T=39, and T=39 is fixed, we need to have exactly 6 U by T=39.\n\nThe minimal H to reach y=9 is achieved by going directly after T=39.\n\nSo with y_39=6, then 3 U to y_42=9, H=12 as before.\n\nWithout the constraint, we could reach earlier, but the unsafe at T=38,39 forces us to be low at that time.\n\nCan we reach y=9 before T=42?\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=8 at T=40 or something.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at T=40, we need y_40=8.\n\nWhich requires action at T=39 with y_39=7 or 8.\n\nBut at T=39, if y_39=7, on row 7, unsafe; if y_39=8, on row 8, unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be on row 7 or 8 at T=39.\n\nTherefore, at T=39, y_39 cannot be 7 or 8, so must be <=6 or 9.\n\nBut y=9 not yet.\n\nSo y_39 <=6.\n\nSimilarly, at T=38, y_38 cannot be 7 or 8, so <=6 or 9.\n\nSo to reach y=9 before T=39? Earliest y=9 at T=39? To have y_39=9.\n\ny_39=9 requires 9 U actions by T=39.\n\nAfter 9 actions from t=30 to t=38, y_39 = number of U minus D.\n\nWith all U, y_39=9.\n\nBut at T=39, if y_39=9, not on freeway, safe.\n\nBut during the path, we might have been on row 7 or 8 at T=38 or 39.\n\nFor example, to reach y=9 at T=39, we need y_39=9.\n\ny_39=9, set by action at t=38.\n\nAt t=38, y_38 must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y_38=8, a_38=U, y_39=9.\n\nOr y_38=9, a_38=S, y_39=9.\n\nBut at T=38, if y_38=8, on row 8, which is unsafe at T=38.\n\nCollision.\n\nIf y_38=9, not on freeway, safe, but to have y_38=9, we need to reach earlier.\n\ny_38=9 at T=38.\n\nThen at T=38, position y=9, not on freeway, safe.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at T=38, we need 9 U actions in 8 turns? Actions from t=30 to t=37, 8 actions, to set y_38.\n\ny_38 = sum Δy from t=30 to t=37.\n\nWith all U, y_38=8, since from y_30=0, after 8 U, at t=38, y=8.\n\nThen at T=38, on row 8, unsafe.\n\nCannot reach y=9 before T=39.\n\nAt T=39, if we could be at y=9, but to have y_39=9, with 9 U in 9 actions (t=30 to 38), y_39=9.\n\nBut at T=39, y=9, safe.\n\nNow, during the path, when are we on row 7 and 8?\n\nWith all U: y_31=1, row 1 safe\n\ny_32=2, safe\n\n...\n\ny_37=7, row 7 at T=37, safe\n\ny_38=8, row 8 at T=38, unsafe! Problem.\n\nIf we have some S, but to reach y=9 at T=39, we need exactly 9 U in 9 actions, no D, so N_U=9, N_S=0 for t=30 to 38, but then y_38=8 (after 8 actions, y at t=38 is 8), and at T=38 on row 8, unsafe.\n\ny_38 is after 8 actions? Actions at t=30 to t=37: 8 actions.\n\nAfter 0 actions, t=30, y=0\n\nAfter 1 action (t=30), t=31, y=1\n\n...\n\nAfter 8 actions (t=30 to t=37), t=38, y=8\n\nThen to have y_39=9, we need action at t=38: U, then y_39=9.\n\nBut at T=38, we are at y=8, on row 8, which is unsafe.\n\nCollision at T=38.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to reach y=9 at or before T=39 without being on row 8 at T=38 or row 7 at T=38 or something.\n\nSimilarly, to avoid, we must not be on row 7 or 8 at T=38 and 39, so we must be at y<=6 at those turns.\n\nThen the earliest to reach y=9 is at T=42, as in the sequences.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can be at y=9 at T=40 or 41.\n\nT=40: y_40=9.\n\nRequires y_40=9, set by action at t=39.\n\nAt t=39, y_39 must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y_39=8, a_39=U, y_40=9.\n\nBut at T=39, if y_39=8, on row 8, unsafe.\n\nIf y_39=9, a_39=S, y_40=9, but to have y_39=9, we need to reach earlier, but as before, cannot without being unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, T=41: y_41=9, set by a_40.\n\ny_40 must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y_40=8, a_40=U, y_41=9.\n\nAt T=40, if y_40=8, on row 8, which is safe only if T>=40, T=40>39, so safe, since unsafe only up to T=39.\n\nRow 8 unsafe at T=38,39, so T=40 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 7 unsafe at T=38,39, T=40 safe.\n\nSo if we can be at y=8 at T=40, then U to y=9 at T=41.\n\nTo be at y=8 at T=40.\n\ny_40=8, set by action at t=39.\n\nAt t=39, y_39 must be 7 or 8.\n\nIf y_39=7, a_39=U, y_40=8.\n\nBut at T=39, if y_39=7, on row 7, unsafe.\n\nIf y_39=8, a_39=S, y_40=8, but to have y_39=8, we need to be at y=8 at T=39, unsafe.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=8 at T=40 without being on row 7 or 8 at T=39.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be at y=7 at T=40 directly.\n\nBut we can be at y=7 at T=40, as in previous plan.\n\ny_40=7, set by a_39 with y_39=6 or 7.\n\nIf y_39=6, a_39=U, y_40=7.\n\nAt T=40, on row 7, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo minimal is to be at y=6 at T=39, then U to y=7 at T=40, U to y=8 at T=41, U to y=9 at T=42.\n\nH=12 turns.\n\nTo have y_39=6 with 6 U and 3 S in the first 9 actions (t=30 to 38).\n\nWe need to specify the sequence.\n\nSince rows 1-6 are safe except row 1 at late times but not issue, we can insert the S actions anywhere.\n\nFor simplicity, we can go up to some point and wait.\n\nFor example, go up to y=6 as fast as possible, then wait.\n\nWith 6 U and 3 S.\n\nActions:\n\nt=30: U, y31=1\n\nt=31: U, y32=2\n\nt=32: U, y33=3\n\nt=33: U, y34=4\n\nt=34: U, y35=5\n\nt=35: U, y36=6  // now at t=36, y=6\n\nThen we need to add 3 S actions, but for y_39=6, we need to stay at y=6 from t=36 to t=39.\n\ny_36=6, y_37=6, y_38=6, y_39=6.\n\nSo actions: at t=36: S, y37=6\n\nt=37: S, y38=6\n\nt=38: S, y39=6\n\nThen t=39: U, y40=7\n\nt=40: U, y41=8\n\nt=41: U, y42=9\n\nNow, at each step, check collision.\n\nt=31: y=1, row 1, T=31, not unsafe (46-49), safe\n\nt=32: y=2, row 2, always safe\n\n...\n\nt=36: y=6, row 6, safe as only unsafe at t=30\n\nt=37: y=6, row 6, safe\n\nt=38: y=6, row 6, safe\n\nt=39: y=6, row 6, safe\n\nt=40: y=7, row 7, T=40, safe (since unsafe only 38,39)\n\nt=41: y=8, row 8, T=41, safe\n\nt=42: y=9, goal\n\nAll actions: t=30 to t=41: U,U,U,U,U,U, S,S,S, U,U,U\n\nSpecifically:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1+1: U\n\n...\n\nt_1=30\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nTurn 33: U\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nTurn 35: U  // now y=6 at t=36\n\nTurn 36: S\n\nTurn 37: S\n\nTurn 38: S\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nReaches y=9 at turn 42.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=30 to t=41, H=12 actions.\n\nAnswer should be the actions for t=30 to t=41.\n\nBut in the box, list each turn.\n\nNow, about row 1 unsafe at T=46-49, but we are done before, no issue.\n\nSimilarly, other rows fine.\n\nWe could have inserted S earlier, but this is fine.\n\nMinimal H is 12.\n\nBut let's see if we can do with H=11.\n\nSuppose H=11, then after 11 actions, at turn t=30+11=41, y_41=9.\n\ny_41=9, so sum of Δy from t=30 to t=40 must be 9.\n\n11 actions, N_U - N_D =9, N_U + N_D + N_S=11.\n\nThen N_U - N_D=9, N_U + N_D + N_S=11.\n\nAdd: 2 N_U + N_S=20, so N_U=10, N_S=0? 2*10 + N_S=20, N_S=0, then N_D=1? From N_U - N_D=9, 10 - N_D=9, N_D=1.\n\nSo possible with 10 U and 1 D, but D decreases y, so we need to go down and up, which might not help.\n\nFor example, to have y_41=9, with actions including one D.\n\nBut during the path, we need to avoid row 7 and 8 at T=38,39.\n\nAt T=38 and 39, y must be <=6.\n\nSuppose we go up fast but with one down to adjust.\n\nFor instance, at some point go down, then up.\n\nBut it might take more turns or same.\n\nFor example, suppose we go up to y=7 at T=37 as before, then at T=37, instead of D, but if we do D, y_38=6, then at T=38 y=6.\n\nThen we need to go to y=9 by T=41.\n\nFrom y=6 at T=38, to y=9 at T=41, need 3 U, so a_38=U, y_39=7, but at T=39 on row 7, unsafe.\n\nIf a_38=S, y_39=6, then a_39=U, y_40=7, a_40=U, y_41=8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at T=41, we need y_41=9, so from y_38=6, we need a_38=U, y_39=7; a_39=U, y_40=8; a_40=U, y_41=9.\n\nBut at T=39, y_39=7, on row 7, unsafe.\n\nCannot.\n\nStart with S or something.\n\nBut with one D, we might have lower y at some point.\n\nSuppose at T=37, y=7, we do D, y_38=6.\n\nThen at T=38, y=6, we do U, y_39=7, but T=39 unsafe.\n\nIf at T=38, we do S, y_39=6, then we can do U at t=39, y_40=7; U t=40, y_41=8; not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at T=41, need y_41=9, so from T=38 y=6, impossible in 3 actions: max y=9 only if we go up three times to y=9 at T=41, but y_39=7 unsafe.\n\nIf we are higher earlier, but we cannot be higher at T=38 because if y_38=7, unsafe at T=38; y_38=8 unsafe.\n\nSo y_38 must be <=6.\n\nSimilarly y_39 <=6.\n\nThen from y_39<=6, to reach y_41=9, we need at least 3 U actions, so y_41 >= y_39 +3 if all U, but y_39 <=6, so y_41 <=9, but if y_39=6, y_41=9 with three U, but during T=40, y=7 or 8, which might be ok, but at T=39 y=6, then a_39=U, y_40=7, at T=40 on row 7, safe; a_40=U, y_41=8, at T=41 on row 8, safe; but y_41=8, not 9. To have y_41=9, we need a_40=U from y=8, but y_40=8, then a_40=U, y_41=9, but at T=40 on row 8, which is safe since T=40>39.\n\nBut to have y_40=8.\n\ny_40=8, at T=40, row 8 safe.\n\nBut y_40=8 requires that at T=39, y_39=7 or 8.\n\nBut at T=39, y_39 cannot be 7 or 8, must be <=6.\n\nContradiction.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to reach y=9 before T=42.\n\nThus minimal H is 12.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, to write the actions.\n\nt_1=30.\n\nActions:\n\nFor turn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nTurn 33: U\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nTurn 36: S\n\nTurn 37: S\n\nTurn 38: S\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nIn the answer, it should be listed as:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}  (which is U)\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}  (U)\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + 11: a_{t_1 + 11}  (U for turn 41)\n\nt_1=30, actions from t=30 to t=41, which is t_1 to t_1 +11.\n\nSo H=12 actions, from t=0 to H-1 relative, with H=12.\n\nIn the sequence, t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nHere t_1 + H -1 = 41, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's confirm the car states, especially row 6.\n\nRow 6 has cars, but unsafe only at T=30, so for T>30, safe.\n\nIn our path, we are on row 6 at T=36,37,38,39, all safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 7 at T=40, safe.\n\nRow 8 at T=41, safe.\n\nRow 1 at T=31, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nWe could have different order of S, but this is fine.\n\nSo the minimal sequence.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 30\\) and must reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\). The unsafe times for each freeway are derived from the car states and their movements:\n\n- Freeway 1 is unsafe at turns 46, 47, 48, and 49.\n- Freeways 2, 3, 4, and 5 are always safe.\n- Freeway 6 is unsafe only at turn 30, but since the player is not on freeway 6 at turn 30, it is safe for all turns after 30.\n- Freeway 7 is unsafe at turns 30, 31, 38, and 39.\n- Freeway 8 is unsafe at turns 30, 31, 38, and 39.\n\nTo reach (0, 9) from (0, 0), at least 9 \"U\" (up) actions are required. However, due to the unsafe periods on freeways 7 and 8 at turns 38 and 39, the player must avoid being on rows 7 or 8 during these turns. This requires the player to be at row 6 or below at turns 38 and 39, necessitating waiting actions.\n\nThe minimal sequence involves:\n- Moving up directly to row 6 by turn 36 using 6 \"U\" actions (turns 30 to 35).\n- Waiting at row 6 for 3 turns using \"S\" (stay) actions (turns 36 to 38) to avoid rows 7 and 8 at turns 38 and 39.\n- Moving up to row 7 at turn 40, row 8 at turn 41, and row 9 at turn 42 using 3 \"U\" actions (turns 39 to 41).\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in 12 turns (actions from turn 30 to 41), with \\(y_{42} = 9\\). It is impossible to reach row 9 in fewer turns without colliding, as being on rows 7 or 8 at turns 38 or 39 would cause a collision, and no sequence with 11 actions can avoid this while reaching row 9 by turn 41.\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n\n- Turn 30: U (move to row 1 at turn 31; row 1 is safe at turn 31)\n- Turn 31: U (move to row 2 at turn 32; row 2 is always safe)\n- Turn 32: U (move to row 3 at turn 33; row 3 is always safe)\n- Turn 33: U (move to row 4 at turn 34; row 4 is always safe)\n- Turn 34: U (move to row 5 at turn 35; row 5 is always safe)\n- Turn 35: U (move to row 6 at turn 36; row 6 is safe at turn 36)\n- Turn 36: S (stay at row 6 at turn 37; row 6 is safe at turn 37)\n- Turn 37: S (stay at row 6 at turn 38; row 6 is safe at turn 38)\n- Turn 38: S (stay at row 6 at turn 39; row 6 is safe at turn 39)\n- Turn 39: U (move to row 7 at turn 40; row 7 is safe at turn 40)\n- Turn 40: U (move to row 8 at turn 41; row 8 is safe at turn 41)\n- Turn 41: U (move to row 9 at turn 42; goal reached)\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions, as all positions during freeway occupancy (rows 1 to 8) are at safe times.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 30: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 31: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 32: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 33: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 34: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 35: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 36: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 37: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 38: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 39: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 40: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 41: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

The cars are moving, and I have to make sure that when I'm on a particular y at turn T, I don't collide with any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car movements. All cars are moving right, according to the table. For right-moving cars, the span at time T is [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)], since head and tail are given, and for right-moving, head is greater than tail, I think. In the span, for right-moving, it's [τ, h] at t_1, and at T, it's [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)].\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1: (-42, -53, right, 3). Here, h = -42, τ = -53? But for right-moving, if it's moving right, head should be greater than tail, but -42 > -53? -42 is larger than -53, since -42 is to the right if we think of increasing x, but x=0 is the point we care about.\n\nI think the coordinate system: x increases to the right, so negative x is left of zero. So for a right-moving car, at t_1, head h is at a larger x than tail τ, so h > τ.\n\nIn freeway 1: h = -42, τ = -53. -42 > -53, yes, since -42 is to the right of -53. So at t_1=32, position is from x= -53 to x= -42.\n\nThen at time T, span is [τ + s(T-32), h + s(T-32)] = [-53 + 3(T-32), -42 + 3(T-32)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway y at turn T, and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nAlso, note: when you move, at turn T, you are on y_T, and you decide action a_T, which affects y_{T+1}. But the collision is checked at each turn based on where you are at that turn.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} until turn T+1. Let me read carefully.\n\n\"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, you are on y_T. After action a_T, you move to y_{T+1}, but you are on y_{T+1} starting from turn T+1.\n\nSo for collision at turn T, it depends only on y_T and the car spans at turn T on that freeway.\n\nNow, the player starts at turn t_1=32, position y=2.\n\nWe need to reach y=9, which is the top, and since y=9 is not a freeway (freeways are y=1 to 8), so when we are at y=9, there are no cars, so no collision possible. Similarly, y=0 is the bottom, but we start from y=2.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), so once we are at y=9, we are done.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=2 to y=9, moving up, but I have to avoid the cars on the way.\n\nSince moving down might be needed to avoid, but since we start at 2 and need to go to 9, probably we want to go up, but we might need to wait or something to avoid cars.\n\nEach action U increases y by 1, D decreases by 1, S keeps same y, all clamped to [0,9].\n\ny=2 to y=9, difference of 7, so minimum moves would be 7 up actions, but we might need to wait or detour if there are cars blocking.\n\nBut in this case, since cars are moving, we can time our crossing.\n\nNow, let's list all the cars and when they occupy x=0.\n\nFor each freeway k, and for each car on it, find when 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nFor a car, at time T, span is [τ + s(T-32), h + s(T-32)] for right-moving cars, since all are right-moving in this state.\n\nAll cars are right-moving, according to the table.\n\nFreeway 1: only one car: h=-42, τ=-53, s=3, direction right.\n\nAt time T, span: [-53 + 3(T-32), -42 + 3(T-32)]\n\n0 is in span when -53 + 3(T-32) ≤ 0 ≤ -42 + 3(T-32)\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFirst, for freeway 1:\n\nSet A = T - 32, the offset.\n\nThen 0 in span if:\n\n-53 + 3A ≤ 0 ≤ -42 + 3A\n\nWhich is:\n\n-53 + 3A ≤ 0 => 3A ≤ 53 => A ≤ 53/3 ≈ 17.666, so A ≤ 17\n\nAnd 0 ≤ -42 + 3A => 42 ≤ 3A => A ≥ 14\n\nSo A ≥ 14 and A ≤ 17\n\nThus for T = 32 + A, so T from 32+14=46 to 32+17=49\n\nSo on freeway 1, car occupies x=0 from turn 46 to 49 inclusive.\n\nA from 14 to 17, T from 46 to 49.\n\nNow, freeway 2: one car: (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nh=-48, τ=-59, s=12\n\nSpan: [-59 + 12A, -48 + 12A]\n\n0 in span: -59 + 12A ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 12A\n\nFirst: -59 + 12A ≤ 0 => 12A ≤ 59 => A ≤ 59/12 ≈ 4.916, so A ≤ 4\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48 + 12A => 48 ≤ 12A => A ≥ 4\n\nSo A ≥ 4 and A ≤ 4, thus A=4\n\nT = 32 + 4 = 36\n\nSo only at turn 36.\n\nA=4: -59 + 12*4 = -59+48= -11 ≤ 0, and 0 ≤ -48 + 48 =0, yes 0≤0, so included.\n\nIf 0 is equal, it is included, since span includes endpoints, I assume.\n\nThe collision occurs if 0 in span, which includes endpoints.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? (-48, -59, right, 12) same car? But different freeway.\n\nFreeway 3: also (-48, -59, right, 12), so same as freeway 2, so only at T=36.\n\nFreeway 4: same, (-48, -59, right, 12), T=36.\n\nFreeway 5: same, (-48, -59, right, 12), T=36.\n\nAll freeways 2,3,4,5 have identical cars? But they are on different freeways, so each has a car that blocks at T=36.\n\nBut for each freeway, we care about when it is occupied at x=0.\n\nFreeway 6: two cars: (-48, -59, right, 12) and (24, 13, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: same as above, blocks at T=36.\n\nSecond car: h=24, τ=13, s=12, right-moving.\n\nτ=13, h=24, so at t_1, span [13,24], moving right.\n\nAt T, span [13 + 12A, 24 + 12A]\n\n0 in span: 13 + 12A ≤ 0 ≤ 24 + 12A\n\nBut 13 + 12A ≤ 0? Since A ≥0, 13+12A ≥13>0, so never ≤0. Similarly, 0 ≤ 24+12A always true for A≥0, but 13+12A ≤0 is impossible since min at A=0 is 13>0. So 0 is never in [13+12A, 24+12A] for any A, since both ends positive and increasing.\n\nSo this car never occupies x=0.\n\nThus for freeway 6, only the first car matters, which blocks at T=36.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars: (-36, -47, right, 6) and (12, 1, right, 6)\n\nFirst car: h=-36, τ=-47, s=6, right\n\nSpan: [-47 + 6A, -36 + 6A]\n\n0 in: -47 + 6A ≤ 0 ≤ -36 + 6A\n\nFirst: -47 + 6A ≤ 0 => 6A ≤ 47 => A ≤ 47/6 ≈ 7.833, so A ≤ 7\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -36 + 6A => 36 ≤ 6A => A ≥ 6\n\nSo A ≥6 and A≤7, so A=6 or 7\n\nT=32+6=38 or 32+7=39\n\nA=6: -47+36= -11 ≤0, 0≤ -36+36=0, yes\n\nA=7: -47+42= -5 ≤0, 0≤ -36+42=6, yes\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,6) τ=1, h=12\n\nSpan: [1 + 6A, 12 + 6A]\n\n0 in: 1+6A ≤0 ≤12+6A\n\n1+6A ≤0? 1+6A ≥1>0, never ≤0, so impossible. Thus never occupies x=0.\n\nSo freeway 7 occupied at T=38 and 39.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same cars as freeway 7? (-36,-47,right,6) and (12,1,right,6), same as above.\n\nSo also occupied at T=38 and 39.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, when it is occupied at x=0 (unsafe to be on that y at that turn):\n\ny=1: occupied at T=46,47,48,49\n\ny=2: occupied at T=36\n\ny=3: occupied at T=36\n\ny=4: occupied at T=36\n\ny=5: occupied at T=36\n\ny=6: occupied at T=36 (since only first car matters)\n\ny=7: occupied at T=38,39\n\ny=8: occupied at T=38,39\n\nAlso, for other times, they are safe, I assume.\n\nNow, the player starts at turn 32, y=2.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=9 has no cars, we just need to be there.\n\nThe actions: we can move up, down, or stay.\n\nEach turn we choose an action, which determines y for next turn.\n\nWe need a sequence from turn 32 to some turn when y=9.\n\nLet t be the turn relative to t_1=32, so at t=0 (turn 32), y=2.\n\nThen at each step t, we choose a_t, which sets y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy based on a_t.\n\ny_t is the position at the start of turn t, I think.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn T, position is y_T.\n\nThen we choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThen at turn T+1, we are at y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn T based on y_T and the car spans at T.\n\nIn this case, T is absolute turn.\n\nSince t_1=32, let's use absolute turns for safety.\n\nStart: turn 32, y=2.\n\nNow, at turn 32, we are on y=2. Is it occupied? For y=2, it is occupied only at T=36, but at T=32, is it occupied?\n\nFor y=2, we have the car on freeway 2, which is occupied only at T=36, so at T=32, not occupied, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nSo at turn 32, y=2 is safe.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe critical points are the occupied times.\n\nTo minimize turns, we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on a freeway when it is occupied.\n\nThe occupied times are clustered: at T=36 for y=2,3,4,5,6; and T=38,39 for y=7,8; and T=46-49 for y=1.\n\ny=1 is occupied late, but we start from y=2, going up, so y=1 might not be relevant unless we go down.\n\nSince we start at y=2 and need to go to y=9, and going down might delay, probably we don't want to go down, but we might need to stay or wait.\n\nBut staying might be necessary to avoid being on a bad y at bad time.\n\nNow, let's think about the path.\n\nFrom y=2 to y=9, we need to increase y by 7, so minimum 7 moves up.\n\nBut with waits, it might take more turns.\n\nSince the obstacles are at specific times, we can plan to not be on the occupied freeways at those times.\n\nFirst, at T=36, y=2,3,4,5,6 are all occupied. So we must not be on any of y=2 to 6 at turn 36.\n\nSimilarly, at T=38 and 39, y=7 and 8 are occupied, so not on y=7 or 8 at those turns.\n\nAt other times, they are safe.\n\nAlso, for y=1, occupied at 46-49, but since we are going up, we might not care about y=1.\n\nNow, we start at turn 32, y=2.\n\nTurn 32: y=2, safe.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=2,3,4,5,6 at turn 36.\n\nTurn 36 is 4 turns from now: 32 to 33,34,35,36, so turn 36 is after 4 steps.\n\nAt turn 32, we are at time 0 relative.\n\nSet t=0 at turn 32.\n\nThen turn 36 is t=4.\n\nAt t=4, we must not be on y=2,3,4,5,6.\n\nSimilarly, at t=6 (turn 38) and t=7 (turn 39), we must not be on y=7 or 8.\n\nAlso, we need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is safe always.\n\nNow, at t=0, y=2.\n\nWe can choose actions to move.\n\nThe occupied events: at t=4, y=2-6 bad.\n\nAt t=6 and t=7, y=7-8 bad.\n\nBut y=7 and 8 only bad at t=6 and t=7, not at other times.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nTo minimize H, the number of turns from start.\n\nH is the number of actions, I think, from t=0 to H-1, so after H turns, we are at turn t_1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\nStart at turn t_1, after 0 actions, position (0, y_{t_1})\n\nAfter first action a_{t_1}, at turn t_1+1, position y_{t_1+1}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut the sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, and we reach y_{t_1 + H -1}? No.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\n\"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}, ..., up to some turn.\n\nAfter the sequence of H actions, we are at y_{t_1 + H}, but the condition is y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9? That seems inconsistent.\n\nLet's parse.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for t from 0 to H-1, so actions at times t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter executing action at time t_1 + k for k=0 to H-1, the position at time t_1 + k +1 is set.\n\nAfter all H actions, the position is at time t_1 + H.\n\nBut the condition is to reach at position (0,9) at some turn, and it says \"reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nPerhaps there's a confusion in indexing.\n\nLet me look back.\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so t from 0 to H-1, so actions at t_1 + 0 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nThen, the state after action: at time t_1 + t, we apply action, which affects y at t_1 + t +1.\n\nSo after action at t_1 + t, position at t_1 + t +1.\n\nTherefore, after the last action at t_1 + H -1, position at t_1 + H.\n\nBut the condition is that at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9? That can't be right because at turn t_1 + H -1, we apply the action to go to y at t_1 + H.\n\nI think there's a mistake.\n\nLet's read the player update: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\" where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, position y_t, we choose a_t, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo position y_t is at the beginning of turn t, before action.\n\nThen after action, at beginning of turn t+1, position y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision at turn t depends on y_t and cars at t.\n\nNow, the sequence: we start at turn t_1, position given.\n\nWe apply actions a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., up to some action, and we want that at some future turn, y_T =9 for T >= t_1.\n\nThe minimal H such that after H actions, we reach y_{t_1 + H} =9? But the condition says \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nIn the task: \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nBut y_{t_1 + H - 1} is the position at turn t_1 + H -1, which is before the H-th action?\n\nLet's see the sequence: actions from t=0 to H-1 for the offset, so actions at absolute times t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter action at t_1 + H -1, we have y at t_1 + H.\n\nBut the position y_{t_1 + H - 1} is at the start of turn t_1 + H -1, before any action at that turn.\n\nI'm confused.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think that the sequence includes actions for turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and after that, at turn t_1 + H, the position is y_{t_1 + H}, but we want y_{t_1 + H} =9, but the condition says y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nLet's read exactly:\n\n\" a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nAnd in the answer format, it lists Turn t_1: a_t1, Turn t_1+1: a_t1+1, ..., Turn t_1 + H -1: a_t1+H-1\n\nAfter executing a_t1+H-1, the position at turn t_1 + H is set, but the condition is that at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nThat means at the start of turn t_1 + H -1, we are already at y=9, and we don't necessarily take an action there, but we might.\n\nIf y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, then at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at y=9, and we can choose to do nothing or something, but the sequence includes actions up to a_{t_1 + H -1}, which is the action at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nIf at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at y=9, and we apply some action, it might move us away, but we want to be at (0,9), so probably we should not move, or stay.\n\nBut the position is checked at each turn for collision, but at y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nBut to reach y=9, it means that at some turn T, y_T =9, and we can stop.\n\nIn the sequence, when we have y_T =9 for T = t_1 + H -1, then at that turn, we might apply an action, but if we apply U or D, we move away, so we should apply S to stay, but the condition is to reach, so once we are at 9, we can stay or the sequence can end.\n\nBut in this case, the sequence includes the action at the turn when we are at 9.\n\nLet's assume that we need to be at y=9 at the start of some turn, and the actions are taken until we are there.\n\nBut the minimal H is the number of actions to reach.\n\nPerhaps for the turn when y_T =9, we don't need to take action if it's the last turn, but the sequence includes actions for turns until we reach.\n\nI think it's standard to include the actions that get us to the position.\n\nLet's look for an example or something.\n\nFrom the player update: to reach a position, we take actions that move us to it.\n\nFor instance, from y=2 at t=32, to be at y=3 at t=33, we apply a_U at t=32.\n\nThen at turn 33, y=3.\n\nSo to be at y=9 at turn T, we need to have applied actions from t=32 to T-1 such that we arrive at y=9 at turn T.\n\nThen the number of actions is T - 32.\n\nThen H, the number of turns, might refer to the number of actions taken.\n\nIn the sequence, {a_t for t=t_1 to t_1 + H -1}, and y_{t_1 + H} =9? But the condition says y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nI think there's an inconsistency.\n\nPerhaps \"turns\" here means the time steps including the start.\n\nLet's read the answer format: it lists \"Turn t_1: a_t1\" up to \"Turn t_1 + H -1: a_t1+H-1\"\n\nAnd after that, at turn t_1 + H, position is set, but we want y at turn t_1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nIf at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9, then we are at 9 at that turn, and we apply action a_t1+H-1, which could be S to stay, or U/D to move, but if we move, we leave, so to be at 9, we should stay or the sequence should end before moving away.\n\nBut the sequence includes the action at the turn when we are at 9.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's assume that we need to have y_T =9 for some T, and the actions are from t_1 to T-1 to reach there at T.\n\nThen H = T - t_1, the number of actions.\n\nThen in the sequence, actions from t_1 to T-1, H actions.\n\nThen y_T =9.\n\nBut the condition says y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, which would be y_{t_1 + (T - t_1) -1} = y_{T-1} =9, but we want y_T=9.\n\nI think it's a typo or misnomer.\n\nPerhaps in some contexts, \"turns\" include the state.\n\nI think for this problem, we should focus on the actions to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nLet's look at the car update: \"at turn T > t_1\", but for collision at T, it's defined.\n\nI think I should proceed with the absolute turns.\n\nStart at turn 32, y=2.\n\nWe want to be at y=9 at some turn T.\n\nThe actions are for turns 32 to T-1.\n\nNumber of actions H = T - 32.\n\nThen in the sequence, actions from 32 to T-1.\n\nThen y_T =9.\n\nBut the task says \"y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\", which with t_1=32, H actions, y_{32 + H -1} =9.\n\n32 + H -1 = T-1 if H=T-32, so y_{T-1} =9, but we want y_T=9.\n\nSo it's inconsistent.\n\nUnless H is defined differently.\n\nPerhaps H is the number of turns including the start or something.\n\nLet's assume that \"minimal number of turns H\" means the number of time steps from start to arrival, so from turn 32 to turn T, there are T-32+1 turns? But that includes both start and end.\n\nBut the actions are between.\n\nI think it's best to follow the task literally.\n\nTask: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nSo for example, if H=1, then sequence {a_{t_1} for t=0 to 0}, so one action at t_1, and y_{t_1 +1 -1} = y_{t_1} =9, so at start turn, we are at 9, but we start at 2, so not.\n\nIf H=2, actions at t_1 and t_1+1, and y_{t_1 +2-1} = y_{t_1+1} =9.\n\nSo after first action at t_1, we are at y_{t_1+1} =9.\n\nIn general, after H actions at times t_1 to t_1+H-1, we have y at time t_1+H, but the condition is that at time t_1+H-1, y=9.\n\nSo for the position at the turn when we take the last action.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T, we take action a_T, then go to y_{T+1}.\n\nBut for the sequence, when we take a_T, we are at y_T.\n\nThe condition y_{t_1 + H -1} =9 means that at the turn when we take the H-th action, we are at y=9.\n\nThen we can take an action, but if we take U or D, we move away, so to be at (0,9), we should take S at that turn to stay, or the sequence could stop, but since it includes the action, we should take S.\n\nIn the context, reaching (0,9) means being there, so at some turn, we are at y=9, and we can stay there.\n\nFor the sequence, if we are at y=9 at turn T, we can include a_S at turn T to stay, or not include it if it's the last.\n\nBut the sequence includes actions until we reach, so probably we include the action at the turn when we arrive or something.\n\nTo simplify, let's assume that we need to be at y=9 at the start of a turn, and the actions are taken to achieve that.\n\nFor this problem, since the occupied times are the constraints, I'll define the turn when we are at each position.\n\nLet's list the unsafe (y,t) pairs:\n\nFrom above:\n\nFor y=2: unsafe at t=36\n\ny=3: unsafe at t=36\n\ny=4: unsafe at t=36\n\ny=5: unsafe at t=36\n\ny=6: unsafe at t=36\n\ny=7: unsafe at t=38,39\n\ny=8: unsafe at t=38,39\n\ny=1: unsafe at t=46,47,48,49 but we may not go there.\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nStart at t=32, y=2.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe earliest we can be at y=9 is if we go up every turn: from y=2, after 7 ups, at turn 32+7=39, y=9.\n\nBut let's check if this is possible.\n\nPath: at t=32, y=2, safe.\n\nAction U: at t=33, y=3\n\nAt t=33, y=3, is it safe? At t=33, for y=3, occupied only at t=36, so at t=33, not occupied, safe.\n\nAction U: at t=34, y=4, safe similarly.\n\nAction U: at t=35, y=5, safe.\n\nAction U: at t=36, y=6.\n\nNow at t=36, y=6, but y=6 is occupied at t=36, so collision! Not safe.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=6 at t=36.\n\nSimilarly, if we go up, at t=36 we are at y=6, which is bad.\n\nIf we go slower, or wait.\n\nAt t=36, we must not be on y=2,3,4,5,6.\n\nSo at t=36, we should be on y=0,1,7,8,9.\n\nBut y=0 or 1 might be possible, but we are going up, so y=7 or 8 or 9.\n\nBut y=7 and 8 are unsafe at t=38 and 39, not at t=36.\n\nAt t=36, y=7 and 8 are safe, since occupied only at 38-39.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 safe.\n\nSo at t=36, we can be on y=7,8,9 or y=0,1.\n\nSince we are coming from below, y=7,8,9 are better.\n\nNow, we start from y=2 at t=32.\n\nWe have 4 turns to t=36: turns 32,33,34,35 actions determine y at t=36.\n\nAt t=36, we need to be at y>=7 or y<=1.\n\nBut y<=1 might not be desirable.\n\nNow, from y=2 at t=32, after actions.\n\nEach action changes y by at most 1 per turn.\n\nSo in 4 turns, we can change y by at most 4.\n\nFrom y=2, we can go to y between 2-4= -2 but clamp to 0, or 2+4=6.\n\nSo at t=36, possible y: min 0, max 6.\n\ny from 0 to 6.\n\nBut we need to be at y>=7 or y<=1 at t=36.\n\nBut y<=1 is possible, y=0 or 1, or y>=7, but max y=6, so y>=7 impossible from here in 4 turns.\n\nMax y at t=36: start y=2, after 4 U actions, y=6 at t=36.\n\nMin y: after 4 D, y=0 at t=36? But y=0 is safe.\n\nOr y=1.\n\nSo at t=36, we must be on y=0 or 1 to avoid collision.\n\ny=0 or 1 are safe at t=36, since occupied only later or not.\n\ny=1 occupied at 46-49, not at 36.\n\ny=0 always safe.\n\nSo we need to be at y=0 or 1 at t=36.\n\nThen from there, we can go up to y=9.\n\nBut we need to also handle the later constraints for y=7 and 8 at t=38,39.\n\nFirst, let's get to t=36 at y=0 or 1.\n\nStart at t=32, y=2.\n\nTo be at y=0 or 1 at t=36.\n\nIn 4 turns, from y=2 to y=0 or 1.\n\nWe need to decrease y.\n\nFor example, go down.\n\nAt t=32, y=2, action D: to y=1 at t=33.\n\nAction D: to y=0 at t=34.\n\nThen at t=34, y=0, safe.\n\nThen we need to be at y=0 or 1 at t=36.\n\nFrom t=34, y=0.\n\nAction S: at t=35, y=0\n\nAction S: at t=36, y=0\n\nOr action S at t=34 to t=35 y=0, then action U to y=1 at t=36.\n\nSimilarly, other ways.\n\nBut let's list the actions.\n\nWe also need to go up later.\n\nFirst, ensure safe at t=36.\n\nFrom t=32, y=2.\n\nOne way: go down to y=1 quickly.\n\nAction at t=32: D, then y=33:1\n\nAt t=33, y=1, safe? y=1 occupied only at 46-49, so at t=33 safe.\n\nThen at t=33, we can stay or move.\n\nTo be at y=0 or 1 at t=36.\n\nAt t=33, y=1.\n\nAction S: stay at y=1 for t=34.\n\nThen at t=34, y=1.\n\nThen action S: to y=1 at t=35.\n\nAt t=35, y=1.\n\nThen action S: to y=1 at t=36.\n\nAt t=36, y=1, safe.\n\nWe could go to y=0.\n\nBut y=1 is fine.\n\nNow, from here, we need to go to y=9.\n\nAt t=36, y=1.\n\nNow, we need to avoid y=7 and 8 at t=38 and 39.\n\nt=38 and 39 are 2 and 3 turns from now? From t=36.\n\nt=36 to t=38 is 2 turns: actions at t=36 and t=37 to set position at t=37 and t=38.\n\nPosition at t=38 depends on actions at t=36 and t=37.\n\nSimilarly, at t=39 depends on t=36,37,38 actions.\n\ny=7 and 8 unsafe at t=38 and t=39.\n\nSo we must not be on y=7 or 8 at t=38, and not on y=7 or 8 at t=39.\n\nAt t=36, y=1.\n\nWe want to go up to y=9.\n\nThe earliest to reach y=9: from y=1, need 8 steps up: to t=37 y=2, t=38 y=3, ..., up to t=44 y=9? Let's calculate.\n\nAt t=36, y=1.\n\nAction U at t=36: to y=2 at t=37\n\nAction U at t=37: to y=3 at t=38\n\nAt t=38, y=3, is it safe? y=3 occupied only at t=36, not at t=38, so safe.\n\nAction U at t=38: to y=4 at t=39\n\nAt t=39, y=4, safe, since not occupied at t=39.\n\nAction U at t=39: to y=5 at t=40\n\nAnd so on, up to y=9 at t=44.\n\nBut at t=38 and t=39, we are on y=3 and y=4, which are not y=7 or 8, so no problem with the t=38,39 constraints.\n\ny=7 and 8 are unsafe only at t=38 and 39, but we are on lower y at that time.\n\nSo this path is safe, but it takes until t=44 to reach y=9, which is 12 turns from start? t=32 to t=44, 12 steps? Actions from t=32 to t=43, 12 actions.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nSince we are at y=1 at t=36, we can go up faster, but we need to avoid being on y=7 or 8 at t=38 and 39.\n\nt=38 is soon: from t=36, only 2 actions to affect position at t=38.\n\nAt t=36, y=1.\n\nAfter action at t=36: can go to y=0,1,2 at t=37.\n\nThen after action at t=37: to y at t=38.\n\nAt t=38, we must not be on y=7 or 8.\n\nSimilarly for t=39.\n\nBut y=7 or 8, from y=1, in 2 steps, we can reach at most y=1+2=3, so at t=38, y <=3, which is less than 7, so automatically not on y=7 or 8. Similarly at t=39, after 3 steps from t=36, y <=1+3=4, still less than 7, so no issue.\n\nThen we can go up directly to y=9.\n\nBut from t=36 y=1, to y=9, need 8 up actions, reach y=9 at t=44.\n\nBut earlier at t=36 we were forced to be low, but perhaps we can be at higher y earlier by not going down all the way.\n\nAt t=36, we need to be at y=0 or 1, but from start, we could be at higher y before t=36 and come down.\n\nFor example, at t=32 y=2, instead of going down, we could go up a bit then down, but since we need to be low at t=36, and max we can be is y=6, which is bad, so we must be low.\n\nBut y=0 or 1.\n\nTo reach y=9 faster, we should minimize the time to go up after t=36.\n\nBut from y=1, it takes 8 steps.\n\nIf we can be at y=1 earlier, but we start at y=2.\n\nAnother idea: at t=36, be at y=1, but then from there, we can go up, but we need to pass through y=7 and 8, which have constraints at t=38,39.\n\nBut since at t=38 and 39, we are still low, as above, y<=4 at t=39, so we pass y=7 and 8 later when it is safe.\n\ny=7 and 8 are only unsafe at t=38 and 39, so at other times, safe to be on.\n\nFor example, after t=39, we can be on y=7 or 8.\n\nIn the direct up path, we reach y=7 at later turn.\n\nBut in this case, from t=36 y=1, go up, at t=37 y=2, t=38 y=3, t=39 y=4, t=40 y=5, t=41 y=6, t=42 y=7, t=43 y=8, t=44 y=9.\n\nAt t=42 y=7, is it safe? y=7 occupied at t=38 and 39, not at t=42, so safe.\n\nSimilarly t=43 y=8, safe.\n\nt=44 y=9, done.\n\nH = number of actions from t=32 to t=43, 12 actions.\n\nBut we can reduce by not going down so early.\n\nWe don't have to go to y=1 at t=36; we can stay higher before and move down just for t=36.\n\nFor example, at t=32 y=2, action U to y=3 at t=33\n\nThen at t=33 y=3, action U to y=4 at t=34\n\nAt t=34 y=4, action U to y=5 at t=35\n\nAt t=35 y=5, now we need at t=36 to be low, so action D to y=4 at t=36? But y=4 is unsafe at t=36.\n\nAt t=35 y=5, action D: to y=4 at t=36, but y=4 occupied at t=36, collision.\n\nAction S: to y=5 at t=36, but y=5 occupied, bad.\n\nAction D: to y=4, bad.\n\nOnly down to y=4 or less, but y=4,5,6 all bad at t=36.\n\nFrom y=5 at t=35, we can only go to y=4,5,6 at t=36, all unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if we are at y=4 at t=35, action to y=3,4,5 at t=36, all unsafe except if we can go to y=3, but y=3 unsafe at t=36.\n\ny=3 also occupied.\n\nOnly y=0,1,7,8,9 are safe at t=36, but from below, we can't reach y=7+ from y=5 in one step.\n\nMax from y=5 is y=6, min y=4, all unsafe.\n\nTherefore, to be safe at t=36, we must be at y<=1 or y>=7, but since we start from y=2 and can only reach y<=6 by t=36, only possibility is y<=1.\n\nSo we must be at y=0 or 1 at t=36.\n\nNo choice.\n\nThus, at t=36, y=0 or 1.\n\nThen from there, we go up.\n\nBut to reach y=9 faster, we should be at y=1 rather than y=0, so we have less to go.\n\nIn the path above, we were at y=1 at t=36.\n\nHow did we get there? From t=32 y=2, we did D to y=1 at t=33, then S to y=1 at t=34, S to y=1 at t=35, S to y=1 at t=36. But we did multiple S, which are waits.\n\nWe could go to y=1 faster.\n\nFor example, at t=32 y=2, action D to y=1 at t=33.\n\nThen at t=33 y=1, we can stay or move, but to be at y=1 at t=36, we need not to move up or down, so we can do S at t=33 to stay at y=1 for t=34, etc.\n\nBut we can go down to y=0 and come back, but that might take more time.\n\nFor example, at t=32 D to y=1 at t=33\n\nThen at t=33 D to y=0 at t=34\n\nThen at t=34, we can stay at y=0 or go up.\n\nBut to be at y=0 or 1 at t=36, we can do from t=34 y=0, action S to y=0 at t=35, then S to y=0 at t=36, or U to y=1 at t=36.\n\nBut y=0 at t=36 is fine, but then from y=0 to y=9, it takes 9 steps, longer than from y=1.\n\nSo better to be at y=1 at t=36.\n\nSo at t=36 y=1.\n\nNow, from there, to reach y=9 asap.\n\nWith the constraints at t=38,39 for y=7,8, but as before, we are not on high y at that time.\n\nBut we can go up faster later, but we need to avoid the occupied times.\n\ny=7 and 8 are only unsafe at t=38 and 39, so after that, safe.\n\nt=39 is turn 39, absolute.\n\nAt t=36, y=1.\n\nWe can start going up.\n\nBut to minimize time, we should go up every turn.\n\nBut let's see when we reach y=7.\n\nFrom t=36 y=1:\n\nt=36: action U, to y=2 at t=37\n\nt=37: action U, to y=3 at t=38\n\nt=38: action U, to y=4 at t=39\n\nt=39: action U, to y=5 at t=40\n\nt=40: action U, to y=6 at t=41\n\nt=41: action U, to y=7 at t=42\n\nt=42: action U, to y=8 at t=43\n\nt=43: action U, to y=9 at t=44\n\nAt t=42 y=7, safe; t=43 y=8, safe; t=44 y=9.\n\nBut we can reach earlier if we can be at higher y before t=36, but we can't because of the constraint.\n\nPerhaps we can go up to y=6 before t=36, but at t=36 we need to be low, so we have to come down, which might take extra turns.\n\nFor example, go up to y=6 by t=35, then at t=35, go down to y=5 at t=36? But y=5 unsafe at t=36.\n\nNot possible.\n\nGo to y=6 at t=34, then down to y=5 at t=35, then to y=4 at t=36, but y=4 unsafe.\n\nAll unsafe except y=0,1.\n\nSo no, we must be at y=0 or 1 at t=36.\n\nThus, the fastest is to go to y=1 as soon as possible and stay there until t=36.\n\nFrom t=32 y=2, action D at t=32 to y=1 at t=33.\n\nThen at t=33 y=1, we need to be at y=1 at t=36, so we can do action S at t=33 to stay at y=1 for t=34.\n\nAction S at t=34 to stay at y=1 for t=35.\n\nAction S at t=35 to stay at y=1 for t=36.\n\nThen at t=36, y=1, safe.\n\nThen from t=36, go up as above.\n\nBut we can save some time: at t=33 y=1, instead of staying, we could go up or down, but if we go up, to y=2 at t=34, then we need to come down to y=1 for t=36, which takes extra down action.\n\nFor example: at t=33 y=1, action U to y=2 at t=34\n\nThen at t=34 y=2, action D to y=1 at t=35\n\nThen at t=35 y=1, action S to y=1 at t=36.\n\nSame as before, but we used U and D instead of two S, but same number of actions to reach t=36 y=1.\n\nFrom t=33 y=1, if we go down to y=0, then at t=34 y=0, then we need to go up to y=1 for t=36, which takes two actions: e.g. S to y=0 at t=35, U to y=1 at t=36, or U to y=1 at t=35, then S to y=1 at t=36, etc., but from y=0 to y=1 takes one up, so at t=34 y=0, action U to y=1 at t=35, then S to y=1 at t=36. So still two actions to be at y=1 at t=36, whereas if we stay at y=1 from t=33, we only need S at t=33 and t=34 to be at y=1 at t=35 and t=36, but to be at y=1 at t=36, with position at t=36.\n\nAt t=33 y=1, if we do nothing, S at t=33, to y=1 at t=34.\n\nThen S at t=34, to y=1 at t=35.\n\nThen S at t=35, to y=1 at t=36.\n\nSo three actions to stay, but we are already at y=1 from t=33.\n\nThe minimal way is to go to y=1 at t=33 and stay there with S until t=36.\n\nNow, from t=36 y=1, go up to y=9.\n\nAs above, 8 up actions to reach y=9 at t=44.\n\nBut we can reach y=9 earlier if we can be on y=7 or 8 at safe times.\n\nFor example, after t=39, y=7 and 8 are safe.\n\nSo we can go faster to higher y after t=36.\n\nBut from y=1, we need to pass through all.\n\nSince y=7 and 8 are safe except at t=38,39, we can be on them at t=40 or later.\n\nBut in the direct path, we are on y=7 at t=42, which is after t=39, so safe.\n\nBut can we be on y=7 earlier?\n\nFrom t=36 y=1, to reach y=7, we need 6 up actions: t=36 U to y=2 t=37, U to y=3 t=38, U to y=4 t=39, U to y=5 t=40, U to y=6 t=41, U to y=7 t=42.\n\nAt t=42, which is after t=39, safe.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot reach y=7 before t=42 from here, since 6 steps.\n\nt=37 y=2, t=38 y=3, etc., up to t=42 y=7.\n\nYes.\n\nBut at t=38 and t=39, we are on y=3 and y=4, which are safe.\n\nNow, another constraint: we have y=1 occupied at t=46-49, but since we are going up, we won't be on y=1 at that time.\n\nIn this path, we reach y=9 at t=44, which is before t=46, so no issue.\n\nBut can we do better?\n\nPerhaps we don't need to go all the way to y=1; we can be at y=0 at t=36, but that would take longer to go up.\n\nFor example, if at t=36 y=0, then to y=9, 9 steps, reach at t=45, later than t=44.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo better y=1 at t=36.\n\nNow, in the sequence to t=36, we have actions: at t=32: D (to y=1 at t=33)\n\nThen at t=33: S (to y=1 at t=34)\n\nt=34: S (to y=1 at t=35)\n\nt=35: S (to y=1 at t=36)\n\nThen t=36: U (to y=2 at t=37)\n\nt=37: U (to y=3 at t=38)\n\nt=38: U (to y=4 at t=39)\n\nt=39: U (to y=5 at t=40)\n\nt=40: U (to y=6 at t=41)\n\nt=41: U (to y=7 at t=42)\n\nt=42: U (to y=8 at t=43)\n\nt=43: U (to y=9 at t=44)\n\nNow, at t=44, y=9, but we need to be at y=9 at some turn for the condition.\n\nIn this case, at turn t=44, y=9, and we took action at t=43 to get there.\n\nFor the sequence, we have actions from t=32 to t=43, 12 actions.\n\nBut at t=44, we are at y=9, but we haven't taken action yet at t=44.\n\nThe condition is to reach y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nt_1=32, so y_{32 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn this case, at t=44, y=9, so 32 + H -1 =44, so 31 + H =44, H=13.\n\nThen y_{32 + 13 -1} = y_{44} =9.\n\nSequence actions from t=32 to t=32+12=44? Let's see.\n\nH=13, actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to 12, so actions at t=32 to t=44.\n\nt from 0 to H-1=12, so t_1 + t from 32 to 44.\n\nThen after action at t=44, position at t=45, but we want y at t=44 to be 9.\n\nIn the sequence, when we take action at turn T, we are at y_T.\n\nThen after action, y_{T+1}.\n\nSo for the turn when we take action, y_T is given.\n\nIn the condition, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, so at the turn when we take the last action, we are at y=9.\n\nThen we take action, which might move us, but if we take S, we stay at y=9 for the next position.\n\nIn this path, at t=43, we are at y=8, take U to go to y=9 at t=44.\n\nThen at t=44, we are at y=9, so if we want to include the action at t=44, we can take S to stay, but we are already at 9.\n\nFor minimal H, we can stop at t=43 action, with y at t=44=9.\n\nBut the condition requires y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, which for H=12, t_1 + H -1 =32+12-1=43, y_43=8, not 9.\n\nFor H=13, t_1+H-1=32+13-1=44, y_44=9.\n\nAnd actions from t=32 to t=44.\n\nBut at t=44, we take action, say S, to stay at y=9 for t=45, but we don't care.\n\nSince we reach at t=44, we can take S at t=44.\n\nIn the sequence above, we have actions up to t=43 to reach y=9 at t=44.\n\nTo have y at turn T=44, we need actions up to t=43.\n\nThen for the sequence, if we include up to a_{43}, then H=12 actions? Let's count.\n\nActions at t=32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43: that's 12 actions, from 32 to 43 inclusive is 12 turns? Turns 32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43: that's 12 actions.\n\nThen y at t=44=9.\n\nBut y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{32 + 12 -1} = y_{43} =8, not 9.\n\nWe need y_{43}=9, but at t=43, we are at y=8 after action from t=42.\n\nTo have y_{t} =9 at some t, we need to be there at the start of turn.\n\nSo for y_{44}=9, we need H such that 32 + H -1 =44, so H=13, and actions from t=32 to t=44 (since t from 0 to 12 for H=13).\n\nThen at t=44, we are at y=9, and we take action a_{44}, which can be S.\n\nIn the sequence, we can have at t=44: S.\n\nBut in terms of reaching, we are at y=9 at t=44 before the action.\n\nSimilarly, in the path, we can add an S at t=44.\n\nBut it doesn't change the position, and we have one extra action.\n\nTo minimize H, we should not have extra actions.\n\nWe can be at y=9 at an earlier turn.\n\nIn this path, we reach at t=44, but perhaps we can reach earlier.\n\nFor example, if we can be at higher y at t=36, but we can't.\n\nAnother idea: after t=36, since the constraints at t=38,39 are for y=7,8, and we are low, but we can go up faster if we don't care about being on y=7,8 after t=39.\n\nBut we are limited by the speed.\n\nFrom t=36 y=1, to y=9, minimum 8 steps, reach at t=44.\n\nBut let's see if we can reduce the time to t=36.\n\nWe are at t=36 y=1, but we arrived at y=1 at t=33, so we waited for 3 turns.\n\nCan we avoid waiting?\n\nFor example, if we go to y=1 at t=33, but then at t=33, we can go up to y=2, but then at t=36 we need to be at y=1, so we have to come down at some point, which costs an extra action.\n\nFor instance: t=32: D to y=1 at t=33\n\nt=33: U to y=2 at t=34\n\nt=34: D to y=1 at t=35\n\nt=35: S to y=1 at t=36\n\nThen at t=36 y=1.\n\nSame as before, but we used U and D instead of S, but same number of actions to reach t=36.\n\nThen from there, same as before.\n\nSo no gain.\n\nGo to y=0 and up, but worse.\n\nSo minimal actions to be at y=1 at t=36 is to go there early and stay.\n\nNow, back to the later part.\n\nAt t=41: U to y=7 at t=42? In the sequence: at t=41, action U, from y=6 at t=41 to y=7 at t=42.\n\nBut at t=42, y=7, which is after t=39, safe.\n\nBut y=7 is occupied only at t=38,39, so at t=42 safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut we have the car on freeway 6, but it's fine.\n\nAnother thing: freeway 6 has a car that occupied at t=36, but we are not on it at that time.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we reach y=9 at t=44.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nAbsolute turns:\n\nTurn 32: action D (to y=1 at 33)\n\nTurn 33: action S (to y=1 at 34)  // stay\n\nTurn 34: action S (to y=1 at 35)  // stay\n\nTurn 35: action S (to y=1 at 36)  // stay\n\nTurn 36: action U (to y=2 at 37)\n\nTurn 37: action U (to y=3 at 38)\n\nTurn 38: action U (to y=4 at 39)\n\nTurn 39: action U (to y=5 at 40)\n\nTurn 40: action U (to y=6 at 41)\n\nTurn 41: action U (to y=7 at 42)\n\nTurn 42: action U (to y=8 at 43)\n\nTurn 43: action U (to y=9 at 44)\n\nNow, at turn 44, we are at y=9. To satisfy the condition, we need y at some turn T=44 to be 9, so for the sequence, if we stop here, we have actions from 32 to 43, 12 actions, but y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{32+12-1}=y_{43}=8, not 9.\n\nSo we need to include turn 44 with action S.\n\nTurn 44: action S (to y=9 at 45, but we are already at 9, so it stays)\n\nThen y at turn 44 is 9, and we take action S.\n\nThen H=13, actions from 32 to 44.\n\ny_{32 + H -1} = y_{32+13-1}=y_{44}=9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut we can avoid the extra action by reaching earlier, but we can't.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 at an earlier turn.\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=2 at t=36, but we can't because it's occupied.\n\nAnother idea: at t=36, we are at y=1, but we can go up immediately, but we have to pass through y=2 to 8.\n\nBut at t=38 and 39, if we can be on y=9, but from y=1 at t=36, to y=9 at t=38, that's 2 steps, impossible, min to y=3 at t=38.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps we don't need to wait at y=1; we can be at y=1 at t=36 but go up faster, but we are already going up every turn.\n\nUnless we can start from higher initial position, but we start at y=2.\n\nOr, we can go up to y=6 before t=36, but then we have to move down to y=1, which takes actions and time.\n\nFor example, at t=32 U to y=3 at 33\n\nU to y=4 at 34\n\nU to y=5 at 35\n\nThen at t=35 y=5, we need to go to y=1 at t=36, but with one action, we can only go to y=4,5,6, all bad.\n\nCannot.\n\nSo no way.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 13, with the sequence including S at the end or something.\n\nBut in the sequence above, with 13 actions.\n\nBut let's list the actions for the sequence.\n\nFrom turn 32 to 44, 13 actions.\n\nBut at turn 44, we take S to stay, but since we are at y=9, it's fine.\n\nTo save one action, we can have y=9 at t=43.\n\nIs it possible?\n\nAt t=43, y=9.\n\nThen we need to be at y=9 at turn 43.\n\nFrom start, at t=32 y=2, to y=9 at t=43, that's 11 steps: from t=32 to t=43 is 11 actions? Actions at t=32 to t=42 to set position at t=33 to t=43.\n\nNumber of actions to go from y=2 at t=32 to y=9 at t=43.\n\nTime difference: from t=32 to t=43, 11 turns later, so 11 actions.\n\ny change from 2 to 9, delta y=7, so minimum 7 up actions, but with 11 actions, we can have 7 up and 4 other, but we need to avoid the constraints.\n\nAt t=36, we must not be on y=2-6.\n\nt=36 is turn 36.\n\nFrom t=32 to t=36, 4 actions, position at t=36.\n\nAs before, at t=36, y must be 0 or 1.\n\nSimilarly, at t=38 and 39, not on y=7 or 8.\n\nNow, to be at y=9 at t=43.\n\nFrom t=36 to t=43, 7 actions.\n\nAt t=36, y=0 or 1.\n\nFrom y=1, to y=9, need 8 steps, but only 7 actions to t=43, so from t=36 to t=43, actions at t=36 to t=42, 7 actions, position at t=37 to t=43.\n\nAt t=36, we are at y= y_36.\n\nAfter action at t=36, to y at t=37, ..., up to action at t=42, to y at t=43.\n\nTo have y at t=43=9.\n\nFrom y at t=36, with 7 actions, we can reach y from y36 -7 to y36 +7, but clamped.\n\nBut since we go up, y36 +7.\n\nIf y36=1, max y at t=43 is 1+7=8, cannot reach 9.\n\nIf y36=0, max y=7, worse.\n\nSo impossible to reach y=9 at t=43 if we are at y=0 or 1 at t=36.\n\nSimilarly, for t=44, as before, with y36=1, we can reach y=9 at t=44.\n\nIf we are at y=1 at t=36, with 8 actions to t=44.\n\nActions from t=36 to t=43 (8 actions) to set y from t=37 to t=44.\n\nAt t=36 y=1, after 8 actions, can reach y=1+8=9 at t=44.\n\nYes, as before.\n\nIf we could be at higher y at t=36, but we can't.\n\nSo t=44 is the earliest possible.\n\nThus minimal H=13, with actions as above.\n\nBut in the sequence, for the answer.\n\nNow, about the action at turn 44: we need to have y=9 at turn 44, so we can take S.\n\nIn the sequence, we can write the actions.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 7 and 8 at other times.\n\nFor example, at t=42, y=7, freeway 7 has cars, but at t=42, are they occupying x=0?\n\nFor y=7, cars occupied at t=38,39 only.\n\nAt t=42, for freeway 7: cars at (-36,-47,right,6) and (12,1,right,6)\n\nAt t=42, A=42-32=10\n\nFirst car: span [-47 +6*10, -36+6*10] = [-47+60, -36+60] = [13,24], not include 0.\n\nSecond car: [1+60,12+60]=[61,72], not 0.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly at t=43 y=8, freeway 8 same cars, span same, not at 0.\n\nSo fine.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions:\n\nFrom turn 32 to 44.\n\nBut for turn 44, action S.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 32: D\n\nTurn 33: S\n\nTurn 34: S\n\nTurn 35: S\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: U  // to y=9 at t=44\n\nThen at turn 44, we are at y=9, and we take action S to stay, but for the sequence, since we reach at t=44, and we need to include action at t=44 for H=13.\n\nIn the condition, with H=13, y_{32+13-1}=y_{44}=9, and actions from t=32 to t=44.\n\nAction at t=44: S\n\nThen position at t=45 is still 9, but we don't care.\n\nTo output the sequence.\n\nBut we can save one action if we reach at t=43, but we can't.\n\nAnother thought: at t=36, we are at y=1, but we can go directly to higher y if we skip the occupied times, but we have to go through all y.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=8 at t=40 or something.\n\nBut from y=1 at t=36, to y=8 at t=40: 4 steps, y=1 to y=5 at t=40, not 8.\n\nImpossible.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus minimal H is 13.\n\nBut let's list the actions in order.\n\nAlso, for freeway 6, there was a second car, but it doesn't affect.\n\nIn the beginning, at turn 32, y=2, which is freeway 2, but at t=32, not occupied, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo the sequence should be:\n\nActions:\n\nAt turn 32: D  // to y=1 at 33\n\nTurn 33: S  // to y=1 at 34\n\nTurn 34: S  // to y=1 at 35\n\nTurn 35: S  // to y=1 at 36\n\nTurn 36: U  // to y=2 at 37\n\nTurn 37: U  // to y=3 at 38\n\nTurn 38: U  // to y=4 at 39\n\nTurn 39: U  // to y=5 at 40\n\nTurn 40: U  // to y=6 at 41\n\nTurn 41: U  // to y=7 at 42\n\nTurn 42: U  // to y=8 at 43\n\nTurn 43: U  // to y=9 at 44\n\nNow, at turn 44, we are at y=9, but for the sequence, if we want to include up to turn 43, then y at turn 43 is 8, not 9.\n\nTo have y at turn 44=9, we need to include action at turn 44 with S.\n\nTurn 44: S  // to y=9 at 45, but position at turn 44 is 9 before action? No.\n\nAt turn 44, position y_44=9, then we take action a_44, which if S, y_45=9.\n\nBut for collision, at turn 44, y=9, no car, safe.\n\nIn the sequence, with H=13, actions from 32 to 44.\n\nAction at 44: S.\n\nSo the full sequence:\n\nTurn 32: D\n\nTurn 33: S\n\nTurn 34: S\n\nTurn 35: S\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: S\n\nThen y at turn 44 is 9, and we take S to stay.\n\nIn the answer, we need to output the actions.\n\nPerhaps we can not include the last S, but the condition requires the sequence until we are at 9.\n\nBut with H=13, it works.\n\nSince at turn 43, after U, we are at y=9 at t=44, and we can consider that we reached, but the position at turn 43 is 8, not 9.\n\nSo I think we need to include the S at 44.\n\nTo avoid the extra action, but we can't reach earlier.\n\nAnother idea: at t=36, be at y=1, then go up, but at some point, for y=7 and 8, since they are safe after t=39, and t=39 is turn 39.\n\nAt t=36 y=1, U to y=2 t=37\n\nU to y=3 t=38\n\nAt t=38, y=3, but we can do a double move or something, but no, only one action per turn.\n\nPerhaps stay at some y to time the crossing.\n\nFor example, after t=36, go up to y=6, then at t=41, we are at y=6, then U to y=7 at t=42, but same as before.\n\nNo gain.\n\nSo I think 13 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the number.\n\nStart at t=32 y=2.\n\nAfter 12 actions (t=32 to 43), at t=44 y=9.\n\nBut for y_{t_1 + H -1}, with H=12, y_{32+12-1}=y_{43}=8 ≠9.\n\nWith H=13, y_{32+13-1}=y_{44}=9.\n\nSo H=13.\n\nNow, for the sequence, in the answer format.\n\nBut in the sequence above, at turn 43 we have U, to go to y=9.\n\nThen at turn 44 S.\n\nBut we can have at turn 43, if we were at y=8, U to y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps at turn 43, we are at y=9, but how? If at turn 42 y=8, U to y=9 at t=43.\n\nThen at turn 43, y=9, and we can take action S or whatever.\n\nIn this case, with actions from t=32 to t=42, 11 actions, y at t=43=9.\n\nThen for the sequence, actions from t=32 to t=42, H=11, then y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{32+11-1}=y_{42}=8 ≠9.\n\nNot.\n\nIf we include action at t=43, with H=12, actions t=32 to t=43.\n\nThen y_{32+12-1}=y_{43}=9.\n\nYes!\n\nIf at turn 43, we are at y=9.\n\nHow? By being at y=8 at turn 42, and take U at turn 42 to go to y=9 at turn 43.\n\nThen at turn 43, position y_43=9.\n\nThen we take action at turn 43, which can be S to stay at y=9 for turn 44.\n\nBut for the position at turn 43, it is 9.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at turn 43.\n\nFrom start, at t=32 y=2, to y=9 at t=43.\n\nDelta t=11 turns, so 11 actions: from t=32 to t=42.\n\ny from 2 to 9, delta y=7, so with 11 actions, we can have 7 U and 4 S or D, but we need to avoid the constraints.\n\nAt t=36, must be at y=0 or 1.\n\nt=36 is after 4 actions from t=32 (actions at 32,33,34,35 set position at 33,34,35,36).\n\nAt t=36, y must be 0 or 1.\n\nSimilarly, at t=38 and 39, not on y=7 or 8.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 at t=43.\n\nt=43 is position after action at t=42.\n\nFrom t=36 to t=43.\n\nAt t=36, y= y36.\n\nThen actions at t=36 to t=42 (7 actions) to set position at t=37 to t=43.\n\ny at t=43.\n\nIf y36=1, then with 7 actions, max y at t=43 is 1+7=8, cannot reach 9.\n\nIf y36=0, max y=7, worse.\n\nThus impossible to reach y=9 at t=43.\n\nTherefore, the earliest is at t=44, with H=13.\n\nSo we must use the sequence with 13 actions.\n\nThus the minimal H is 13.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nThe sequence of actions:\n\nTurn 32: D\n\nTurn 33: S\n\nTurn 34: S\n\nTurn 35: S\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: S\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut at turn 44, S is not necessary, but to have the position.\n\nSince at turn 43, after U, we are at y=9 at t=44, and for the condition, with H=13, it includes up to turn 44.\n\nWe can write.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 2) at turn 32 with minimal turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8, the following sequence of actions is required. The cars' movements and occupancy at x=0 have been analyzed to ensure the player avoids collisions at critical turns.\n\n### Key Constraints from Car Occupancy:\n- Freeways y=2,3,4,5,6 are occupied at turn 36 (t=36), so the player must not be on these freeways at t=36.\n- Freeways y=7 and 8 are occupied at turns 38 and 39 (t=38 and t=39), so the player must not be on these freeways at these turns.\n- At turn 36, to avoid collision, the player must be on y=0 or y=1 (safe positions at t=36).\n- The earliest possible turn to reach y=9 is turn 44, as the constraints force a detour to y=1 at turn 36, adding necessary delay.\n\n### Minimal Sequence:\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 13, with actions from turn 32 to turn 44. The sequence ensures:\n- At turn 36, the player is at y=1 (safe).\n- At turns 38 and 39, the player is at y=3 and y=4 (not y=7 or 8, safe).\n- The player reaches y=9 at turn 44.\n\n**Action Sequence**:\n- Turn 32: D (move down to y=1 at turn 33)\n- Turn 33: S (stay at y=1 for turn 34)\n- Turn 34: S (stay at y=1 for turn 35)\n- Turn 35: S (stay at y=1 for turn 36)\n- Turn 36: U (move up to y=2 at turn 37)\n- Turn 37: U (move up to y=3 at turn 38)\n- Turn 38: U (move up to y=4 at turn 39)\n- Turn 39: U (move up to y=5 at turn 40)\n- Turn 40: U (move up to y=6 at turn 41)\n- Turn 41: U (move up to y=7 at turn 42)\n- Turn 42: U (move up to y=8 at turn 43)\n- Turn 43: U (move up to y=9 at turn 44)\n- Turn 44: S (stay at y=9 for turn 45; position (0,9) is reached at turn 44)\n\nThis sequence achieves y=9 at turn 44 with \\(H=13\\) turns (actions from turn 32 to turn 44). No shorter sequence is possible due to the constraints at turn 36 and the need to traverse from y=1 to y=9.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 32: \\text{D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 33: \\text{S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 34: \\text{S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 35: \\text{S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 36: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 37: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 38: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 39: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 40: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 41: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 42: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 43: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 44: \\text{S} \\end{array} }",

Each turn, I can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing my y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but I have to stay within y=0 to y=9.\n\nThe collision happens only if at turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T where there's a car with 0 in its span at that turn. The note says that if I move to a different y at turn T, I'm not on that new y until the next turn, so I only care about the cars on my current y at each turn.\n\nThe car spans are given at turn t_1 = 36, and for future turns, I need to compute where the cars will be based on their speed and direction.\n\nLet me list all the cars and their positions at t=36.\n\nFor freeway 1: one car, head -48, tail -59, right direction, speed 3. Since it's right-moving, the span at T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]. Head and tail: for right-moving, head is larger, so h=48? No, the table says head h, tail τ, and for right-moving, it says span at t_1 is [τ, h] with τ < h? Let me read carefully.\n\nIn the car update rules:\n\nFor left-moving: span(t_1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nFor right-moving: span(t_1) = [τ, h] → span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the state table, for each car, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nI think there might be inconsistency in notation.\n\nFor freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nSince direction is right, and for right-moving, the span at t_1 is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? But head and tail: typically head is the front.\n\nIn the rule, for right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h] with τ and h such that τ < h, I assume.\n\nHere, for freeway 1, h = -48, τ = -59, and since direction right, τ = -59, h = -48, so τ < h, so span at t_1 is [τ, h] = [-59, -48].\n\nThen at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-59 + 3(T-36), -48 + 3(T-36)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2: (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nh=48, τ=37, direction right, so span at t_1: [τ, h] = [37,48]\n\nAt T: [37 + 12(T-36), 48 + 12(T-36)]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? (48,37,right,12) — identical?\n\nFreeway 4: same (48,37,right,12)\n\nFreeway 5: same (48,37,right,12)\n\nAll from 2 to 5 have the same car? That can't be right, or are there multiple cars per freeway?\n\nLook at freeway 6: (48,37,right,12), (0,-11,right,12) — two cars.\n\nSimilarly, 7 and 8 have two cars each.\n\nSo for freeway 1: one car, span at T: [-59 + 3(T-36), -48 + 3(T-36)]\n\nFreeway 2: one car, span at T: [37 + 12(T-36), 48 + 12(T-36)]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? It says (48,37,right,12) — probably a typo or it's the same, but I think we have to treat them separately, meaning each freeway has its own cars.\n\nBut for freeway 2,3,4,5, each has a car with identical parameters? That seems odd, but I'll assume that's the case.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6 has two cars: first (48,37,right,12), second (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFreeway 7: (-48,-59,right,6), (0,-11,right,6)\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7, (-48,-59,right,6), (0,-11,right,6)\n\nNow, I start at turn t=36, position y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nAt each turn, I choose action U, D, or S, changing y by +1, -1, 0.\n\nI must avoid being on a freeway y when for that y, at that turn, there is a car with 0 in its span.\n\nThat is, for a given freeway k and turn T, if I am on y=k at turn T, then there should be no car on freeway k such that 0 is in [span low, span high] for that car at turn T.\n\nAlso, since I start at y=0 at t=36, and y=0 is not a freeway, so no cars there, so it's safe to be at y=0.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 is the goal, and no cars there.\n\nThe freeways are from y=1 to y=8.\n\nNow, the minimal number of turns: since I need to go from y=0 to y=9, the minimum possible is 9 turns if I go up every time, but I might need to wait or avoid cars, so it could take longer.\n\nBut I need to find the minimal H, and the sequence.\n\nFirst, I need to compute for each freeway and each future turn, where the cars are and when they cover position x=0.\n\nBecause collision happens when 0 is in the span for that freeway at that turn.\n\nSo for each freeway k, and for each car on it, I need to find the times T when 0 is in the span of that car.\n\nThen, for freeway k, at turn T, if any car on k has 0 in span, then it's dangerous to be on y=k at turn T.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nI need to be on y=k only when it's safe for that turn.\n\nSince I move step by step, I need to plan a path through the y-positions over time.\n\nStart at t=36, y=0.\n\nAt each turn, I choose action, which determines y for next turn? No.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn T, I am at position (0, y_T).\n\nI choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, with Δy based on a_T.\n\nThen, at turn T, I am on freeway y_T (if y_T between 1 and 8), and collision happens if for freeway y_T, at turn T, there is a car with 0 in its span.\n\nThen, after action, I move to y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nIn the collision condition: at turn T, I am on y_T, and I check cars on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nIf I choose to move to y_{T+1} at turn T, I am not on y_{T+1} until turn T+1, so at turn T, I'm still on y_T.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1)\"\n\nYes, so at turn T, I am only concerned with the cars on my current y_T.\n\nFor the new position, I care at turn T+1.\n\nOkay.\n\nSo, back to planning.\n\nI need to go from y=0 at t=36 to y=9 at some turn, say t=36+H.\n\nAt turn 36+H, I should be at y=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for t from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, so H actions over H turns, starting from t_1.\n\nAt time t, I choose a_t, which affects y_{t+1}.\n\nLet me define the state at time t.\n\nSet t_1 = 36.\n\nAt t=36, y=0.\n\nI choose a_36, which sets y_37 = y_36 + Δy = 0 + Δy, so y_37 = Δy, which can be 1 if U, or 0 if S, or -1 if D, but y=0, D would make y=-1, but y must be in [0,9], so I can't go below 0, so at y=0, D is invalid? Or does it stay 0?\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so if y_t=0 and a_t=D, then y_{t+1} = 0 -1 = -1, but must be >=0, so I think it stays 0 or something. The constraint is y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so it must be clipped, but it's not specified.\n\nLet me read: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where ... , y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9]\"\n\nIt doesn't say how the clipping is done, but since Δy is +1, -1, 0, and y between 0 and 9, the only issue is at boundaries.\n\nIf y_t=0 and a_t=D, y_{t+1} = -1 not in [0,9], so it should be set to 0? Or action is invalid? I think it's implied that actions are chosen such that y_{t+1} stays in range, so at y=0, I cannot choose D, similarly at y=9, cannot choose U.\n\nSimilarly for S, it stays.\n\nIn this case, at t=36, y=0, possible actions: U to go to y=1, or S to stay at y=0, D is invalid since y=0.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, only D or S.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway k, the times when it is dangerous, i.e., when there is a car covering x=0.\n\nFor freeway k, at time T, dangerous if any car on k has 0 in its span at T.\n\nSince multiple cars, I need the union over cars.\n\nLet's compute for each freeway.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car, right-moving, span at T: [ -59 + 3(T-36) , -48 + 3(T-36) ]\n\nSet t = T - 36, so t is offset from current turn.\n\nAt relative time t, span: low = -59 + 3t, high = -48 + 3t\n\n0 in span if low <= 0 <= high, so -59 + 3t <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 3t\n\nFirst inequality: -59 + 3t <= 0 => 3t <= 59 => t <= 59/3 = 19.666, so t <= 19 since integer turn? Turns are discrete, so t integer.\n\nT is turn, so t = T - 36 integer.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 <= -48 + 3t => 48 <= 3t => t >= 16\n\nSo for t from 16 to 19 inclusive.\n\nt=16: low = -59 + 48 = -11, high = -48 + 48 = 0, so 0 <= 0 <= 0, yes, 0 is included.\n\nt=17: low = -59+51= -8, high= -48+51=3, 0 in [-8,3]\n\nt=18: low=-59+54= -5, high=-48+54=6, 0 in\n\nt=19: low=-59+57= -2, high=-48+57=9, 0 in\n\nt=20: low=-59+60=1, high=-48+60=12, 1<=0<=12? 0<1, not <=, so 0 not in [1,12], since 1>0.\n\nSimilarly t=15: low=-59+45= -14, high=-48+45= -3, -14<=0<= -3? 0 <= -3 false.\n\nSo dangerous for t=16,17,18,19 relative, so T=36+16=52 to 36+19=55.\n\nT=52,53,54,55.\n\nNow freeway 2: one car, (48,37,right,12)\n\nSpan at t_1: [τ, h] = [37,48]\n\nAt T: [37 + 12(T-36), 48 + 12(T-36)]\n\nSet t=T-36\n\n[37 + 12t, 48 + 12t]\n\n0 in span if 37+12t <= 0 <= 48+12t\n\nBut 37+12t <=0? 12t <= -37, t <= -37/12 ≈ -3.083, so t <= -4? But t>=0, since T>=36, t>=0.\n\n37+12t >=37 >0, so low >=37>0, so 0 <= low <= high, but 0 < low, so 0 not in span. Similarly, high=48+12t >0.\n\nSo never 0 in span for freeway 2 car.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3,4,5: all have the same car? Each has a car with (48,37,right,12), so same as freeway 2, never covers 0.\n\nFreeway 6: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12), same as above, never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12)\n\nHead h=0, tail τ=-11, direction right.\n\nSpan at t_1: [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt T: [ -11 + 12(T-36), 0 + 12(T-36) ] = [ -11 +12t, 12t ] with t=T-36\n\n0 in span if low <=0<= high, so -11+12t <=0 and 0<=12t\n\nFirst: -11+12t <=0 => 12t <=11 => t<=11/12<1, so t<=0\n\nSecond: 0<=12t always true for t>=0.\n\nBut t<=0 and t>=0, so t=0.\n\nAt t=0, T=36, span: [-11,0], so 0 in [ -11,0], yes.\n\nFor t>0, low=-11+12t, for t=1, low=-11+12=1, high=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at t=0, T=36.\n\nBut t=0 is current turn, and we are at t=36, but we are on y=0, not on freeway 6, so at turn 36, we don't care about freeway 6.\n\nFor future, for freeway 6, the second car covers 0 only at T=36.\n\nNow, freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nh=-48, τ=-59, direction right.\n\nSpan at t_1: [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nAt T: [ -59 + 6(T-36), -48 + 6(T-36) ]\n\nSet t=T-36\n\n[ -59 +6t, -48 +6t ]\n\n0 in span if -59+6t <=0 <= -48+6t\n\nFirst: -59+6t <=0 => 6t <=59 => t<=59/6≈9.833, t<=9\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48+6t => 48 <=6t => t>=8\n\nSo t from 8 to 9 inclusive.\n\nt=8: low=-59+48= -11, high=-48+48=0, 0 in [-11,0]\n\nt=9: low=-59+54= -5, high=-48+54=6, 0 in\n\nt=10: low=-59+60=1, high=-48+60=12, 0 not in\n\nt=7: low=-59+42= -17, high=-48+42= -6, 0 not <= -6? no\n\nSo dangerous at t=8,9, T=44,45\n\nSecond car on freeway 7: (0,-11,right,6)\n\nh=0, τ=-11, direction right.\n\nSpan at t_1: [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt T: [ -11 + 6(T-36), 0 + 6(T-36) ] = [ -11 +6t, 6t ]\n\n0 in span if -11+6t <=0 <=6t\n\nFirst: -11+6t <=0 => 6t<=11 => t<=11/6≈1.833, t<=1\n\nSecond: 0<=6t always for t>=0\n\nSo t=0 and t=1.\n\nt=0: T=36, span [-11,0], 0 in\n\nt=1: T=37, span [-11+6,6] = [-5,6], 0 in\n\nt=2: [-11+12,12] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo dangerous at T=36 and T=37.\n\nBut T=36: current turn, we are at y=0, not on freeway 7.\n\nT=37: dangerous if on freeway 7.\n\nNow freeway 8: same as freeway 7? Two cars: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nFirst car: same as freeway 7 first car, dangerous at T=44,45\n\nSecond car: same as above, dangerous at T=36,37\n\nNow summarize for each freeway the dangerous times.\n\nFreeway 1: dangerous at T=52,53,54,55\n\nFreeway 2: never dangerous (car never at 0)\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2, never\n\nFreeway 4: same, never\n\nFreeway 5: same, never\n\nFreeway 6: first car never, second car only at T=36 (but not relevant now)\n\nFor freeway 6, dangerous only at T=36 for the second car.\n\nAt T=36, if on freeway 6, dangerous, but we are not.\n\nFreeway 7: dangerous when:\n\nFirst car: T=44,45\n\nSecond car: T=36,37\n\nSo overall for freeway 7, dangerous at T=36,37,44,45\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7, dangerous at T=36,37,44,45\n\nFreeway 6 dangerous only at T=36.\n\nNow, freeways 2,3,4,5 are always safe? Since no car covers 0 at any time.\n\nFreeway 2: car at [37+12t,48+12t] all positive, so yes, never at 0.\n\nSimilarly for 3,4,5.\n\nFreeway 1 dangerous at 52-55.\n\nFreeway 6 dangerous only at 36, which is past.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 dangerous at 36,37,44,45.\n\n36 and 37 are soon, 44,45 later.\n\nI need to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nAt t=36, y=0.\n\nI need to choose action.\n\nPossible: S or U.\n\nIf S, stay at y=0 for next turn? Action a_t at time t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt time t, I am at y_t, choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nAt time t, I am on y_t.\n\nFor example, at t=36, I am on y=0, which is safe.\n\nI choose a_36, which will set y_37.\n\nIf a_36 = S, then y_37 = 0\n\nIf a_36 = U, then y_37 = 1\n\nIf D, invalid.\n\nNow, at t=37, I will be on y_37.\n\nIf I go to y=1 at t=37, I need to check if freeway 1 is safe at t=37.\n\nFreeway 1 dangerous times: 52,53,54,55, so at t=37, T=37, freeway 1 is safe, since not dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nBut freeway 7 and 8 are dangerous at t=37.\n\nBut if I am on y=1 at t=37, freeway 7 is y=7, different, so I don't care.\n\nOnly the freeway I am on matters at that turn.\n\nSo at t=37, if I am on y=1, I care about cars on freeway 1 at t=37.\n\nFreeway 1 at t=37: not dangerous, as above.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, I need to pass through y=1 to 8.\n\nBut some are dangerous at certain times.\n\nSince freeways 2,3,4,5 are always safe, I can be on them any time.\n\nFreeway 1 dangerous only at t=52-55, so avoid being on y=1 at those times.\n\nFreeway 6 dangerous at t=36, but past, so always safe except at t=36 which is over.\n\nFreeway 6 dangerous only at T=36, so for T>36, safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 dangerous at t=36,37,44,45\n\nSo avoid y=7 at t=36,37,44,45\n\nBut t=36 and 37 are now or soon.\n\nt=36 is current, we are at y=0.\n\nt=37: if I go to y=7 at t=37, it would be dangerous, but I can choose not to.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 dangerous at same times: 36,37,44,45\n\nNow, I start at t=36, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal path would be to go up as fast as possible, but avoiding the dangerous times.\n\nFirst, let's list the dangerous freeways by time.\n\nTime t (absolute) when certain y are dangerous:\n\n- y=7 dangerous at t=44,45\n\n- y=8 dangerous at t=44,45? Freeway 8 same as 7.\n\nFreeway 8 dangerous at t=36,37,44,45\n\nBut t=36,37 are early.\n\n- y=1 dangerous at t=52,53,54,55\n\nAll other times, y=1 is safe.\n\ny=2,3,4,5 always safe.\n\ny=6 safe except t=36, but t=36 over, so always safe for t>=37.\n\ny=7 dangerous at t=36,37,44,45\n\ny=8 dangerous at t=36,37,44,45\n\ny=9 always safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 safe.\n\nTo go from 0 to 9, I need to increase y.\n\nThe shortest way is 9 steps up: at each turn, go up, so from t=36 to t=45, y from 0 to 9.\n\nt=36: y=0\n\na_36=U, y_37=1\n\nt=37: at y=1, choose a_37, say U, y_38=2\n\n...\n\nup to t=44: at y=8 (since from t=36 to t=37: y=1, t=38:y=2, ..., t=44: y=8? Let's see:\n\nAt t=36: y=0\n\nAfter a_36=U: y_37=1\n\nt=37: at y=1, a_37=U, y_38=2\n\nt=38: at y=2, a_38=U, y_39=3\n\nt=39: y=3, a_39=U, y_40=4\n\nt=40: y=4, a_40=U, y_41=5\n\nt=41: y=5, a_41=U, y_42=6\n\nt=42: y=6, a_42=U, y_43=7\n\nt=43: y=7, a_43=U, y_44=8\n\nt=44: at y=8, a_44=U, y_45=9\n\nt=45: at y=9, done.\n\nNow, I need to check for each turn, when I am on a freeway, it is safe.\n\nFreeways y=1 to 8.\n\nIn this path:\n\nAt t=37: on y=1, freeway 1. Dangerous only at t=52-55, t=37<52, safe.\n\nt=38: on y=2, freeway 2, always safe.\n\nt=39: y=3, safe.\n\nt=40: y=4, safe.\n\nt=41: y=5, safe.\n\nt=42: y=6, freeway 6, safe for t>36.\n\nt=43: on y=7, freeway 7. Dangerous at t=44,45? t=43, is it dangerous?\n\nFreeway 7 dangerous at t=36,37,44,45.\n\nt=43 not in, so safe.\n\nt=44: on y=8, freeway 8. Dangerous at t=36,37,44,45. t=44 is dangerous! Oh.\n\nAt t=44, on y=8, which is dangerous.\n\nProblem.\n\nAlso, at t=43: y=7, t=43 not dangerous, safe.\n\nBut t=44: y=8, dangerous.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=44, I am on y=8, and freeway 8 dangerous at t=44.\n\nSo collision.\n\nTherefore, cannot be on y=8 at t=44.\n\nSimilarly, at t=45, if I were on y=8, but in this sequence, at t=44 I go to y=9, so at t=44 I am on y=8 before moving.\n\nIn the sequence: at t=44, I am at y=8, choose a_44=U, go to y_45=9.\n\nBut at turn t=44, I am on y=8, and it is dangerous.\n\nSo collision at t=44.\n\nThus, this path has collision at t=44.\n\nI need to avoid that.\n\nI could delay or something.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 are dangerous at t=44 and 45, I need to not be on them at those times.\n\nIn the direct path, I am on y=7 at t=43 (safe), y=8 at t=44 (dangerous).\n\nt=43 is safe for y=7, t=44 dangerous for y=8.\n\nI could stay at some safe position to avoid being on y=8 at t=44.\n\nFor example, at some point, I can stay still or move slower.\n\nBut I want minimal turns, so I should go as fast as possible except when necessary to wait.\n\nThe dangerous times are t=44,45 for y=7 and y=8.\n\nAlso, later for y=1 at 52-55, but that is later, not immediate.\n\nSince I start from 0, and go up, I might reach before t=44 or after t=45.\n\nIn 9 steps, I reach at t=45 to y=9, but the last action is at t=44 to go to y=9 at t=45.\n\nAt t=45, I am at y=9, which is safe.\n\nBut the issue is at t=44, I am on y=8 when dangerous.\n\nTo avoid that, I need not to be on y=8 at t=44 or t=45.\n\nt=45, if I can be at y=9 at t=45, then at t=45 I am on y=9, safe, no issue.\n\nBut at t=44, I need to be on a safe position.\n\nIn the sequence, I am on y=8 at t=44.\n\nI could arrive at y=8 later or earlier.\n\nFor example, if I go slower, I might be on y=8 after t=45.\n\nBut since t=45 is also dangerous for y=8, I need to avoid both t=44 and t=45 for y=8.\n\nSimilarly for y=7, avoid t=44,45.\n\nNow, let's list safe times for each y.\n\ny=1: safe except t=52,53,54,55. So for t=36 to 51 and t=56+, but since we start early, t<=51 safe for now.\n\ny=2: always safe\n\ny=3: always\n\ny=4: always\n\ny=5: always\n\ny=6: always safe for t>=37\n\ny=7: safe except t=36,37,44,45. Since t=36,37 past or soon, avoid t=44,45. So safe for t=38-43,46+, etc.\n\ny=8: safe except t=36,37,44,45. Similarly, safe for t=38-43,46+\n\ny=9: always safe\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 at t=36 to y=9 at some T.\n\nThe path must avoid being on dangerous y at dangerous times.\n\nSince y=2,3,4,5 are always safe, I can stay there if needed.\n\ny=6 always safe.\n\nThe critical part is crossing y=7 and y=8 when not dangerous, i.e., not at t=44,45.\n\nSo the safe windows for y=7 and y=8 are before t=44 or after t=45.\n\nSpecifically, t <=43 or t>=46 for y=7 and y=8.\n\nBut since I need to go up, and y=7 and y=8 are consecutive, I need to be on them in sequence.\n\nPossible to be on y=7 at t=43 (safe), then at t=44, I move to y=8, but at t=44, if I move to y=8, at turn t=44, I am on y=7? Let's see.\n\nAt time t, I am on y_t.\n\nI choose action to go to y_{t+1}.\n\nIf at t=43, I am on y=7, which is safe at t=43.\n\nI choose a_t: if U, go to y=8 at t=44.\n\nBut at t=44, I will be on y=8, which is dangerous if t=44.\n\nIf I choose S at t=43, I stay at y=7 for t=44? At t=43, choose S, then y_{44} = y_{43} =7, so at t=44, I am on y=7.\n\nBut y=7 is dangerous at t=44, so if I stay on y=7 at t=44, collision.\n\nIf I choose D, go down to y=6, but y=6 is safe.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nTo avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at t=44 or t=45.\n\nAt t=44, I should not be on y=7 or y=8.\n\nSimilarly at t=45.\n\nNow, in the minimal path, I am on y=7 at t=43 (safe), y=8 at t=44 (dangerous).\n\nI need to adjust.\n\nOption: at t=43, instead of going up to y=8 at t=44, I could stay or go down.\n\nBut if I stay at y=7 at t=44, it is dangerous.\n\nSo I must leave y=7 before t=44 or after, but at t=43 I am on y=7, if I stay, at t=44 on y=7 dangerous.\n\nIf I go down to y=6 at t=44, then at t=44 I am on y=6? Let's see.\n\nAt t=43: on y=7, choose action.\n\nIf choose D, then y_{44} = 7 -1 =6, so at t=44, I am on y=6.\n\ny=6 is safe at all times except t=36, which is past.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen at t=44, on y=6, I can choose to go up later.\n\nSimilarly, if I go up to y=8, but at t=44 on y=8 dangerous.\n\nSo better to go down to y=6 at t=44.\n\nThen, since t=45 is also dangerous for y=7 and y=8, I need to wait until t=46 or later to go up.\n\nBut that would take more turns.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 faster by going slower earlier.\n\nFor example, spend more time at lower levels to avoid the dangerous times.\n\nBut minimal H, so I want to minimize the number of turns.\n\nCurrently, the direct path takes 9 turns to reach at t=45, but with collision at t=44.\n\nI need to avoid that.\n\nSo, one way is to be on y=8 before t=44 or after t=45.\n\nBut before t=44: for example, if I go up faster, but I start from y=0 at t=36, to reach y=8.\n\nFrom y=0 to y=8, minimum 8 steps.\n\nAt t=36: y=0\n\nAfter 8 steps: at t=44, y=8? Let's see.\n\nt=36: y=0\n\na36 U, y37=1\n\na37 U, y38=2\n\n...\n\na43 U, y44=8? t=36 to t=37: y=1 at t=37\n\nt=37 to t=38: y=2 at t=38\n\n...\n\nAt time t, y_t.\n\nt=36: y=0\n\nt=37: y=1\n\nt=38: y=2\n\n...\n\nt=43: y=7\n\nt=44: y=8 if I go up at t=43\n\nBut at t=44, y=8 dangerous.\n\nIf I go up faster, I cannot, because I start at t=36 y=0, earliest to y=8 is at t=44 with y=8.\n\nt=36: y=0\n\nt=37: y=1\n\n...\n\nt=44: y=8\n\nYes, after 8 actions, from t=36 to t=44, y from 0 to 8 at t=44.\n\nBut at t=44, y=8 dangerous.\n\nTo be on y=8 before t=44, that would be at t=43 or earlier.\n\nAt t=43, y=7 in the sequence, not y=8.\n\nTo have y=8 at t=43, I need to reach y=8 earlier.\n\nBut from start, at t=36 y=0, to be at y=8 at t=43, that means in 7 steps: from t=36 to t=43, that is 7 turns? Time from t=36 to t=43 is 7 steps? Let's index.\n\nAt t=36, y=0\n\nAfter k actions, y at t=36+k.\n\nTo be at y=8 at time T, it takes at least 8 steps from t=36.\n\nAt t=36: y=0\n\nAfter first action at t=36, y_37= y after first move.\n\nPosition at time t: y_t.\n\ny_{36} = 0\n\ny_{37} = after a_36\n\n...\n\ny_{36+H} = position after H actions.\n\nTo have y_{36+H} =9.\n\nIn terms of time, at time T, position y_T.\n\nFor example, at T=36, y=0\n\nT=37, y=1 if moved up, etc.\n\nTo be at y=8 at time T.\n\nSince from y=0, to reach y=8, it takes at least 8 moves up, so at time T=36 + K, with K>=8, y can be 8.\n\nEarliest at T=36+8=44, y=8.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at T=44 is the earliest possible.\n\nBut at T=44, y=8 dangerous.\n\nNext possible is T=45, but at T=45, if I am at y=8, but y=8 dangerous at T=45, so also dangerous.\n\nT=45 is dangerous for y=8.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=8 at T=44 or T=45.\n\nThe next safe time for y=8 is T=46 or later.\n\nSimilarly for y=7, I cannot be on it at T=44 or T=45.\n\nSo I need to be on y=8 at T>=46 or T<=43.\n\nBut T<=43: to be at y=8 at T=43, that would require starting from y=0 at T=36, to y=8 at T=43, which is 7 steps: but from T=36 to T=43, it takes 7 actions? Positions:\n\nAt T=36: y=0\n\nAfter a_36, y_37\n\n...\n\nAfter a_42, y_43\n\nTo have y_43=8, I need to have increased y by 8 in 7 moves? From y_36 to y_43, that is 7 steps (t=36 to 37, ..., 42 to 43), so y_43 = y_36 + sum of 7 Δy, each +1,0,-1.\n\nTo have y_43=8, since y_36=0, sum of 7 Δy =8, but each |Δy|<=1, so maximum increase is +7, so y_43 <=7, cannot be 8. So impossible to be at y=8 at T=43 or earlier.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at T=44 is earliest possible, but dangerous.\n\nAt T=45, also dangerous.\n\nSo the earliest I can be at y=8 safely is T=46.\n\nAt T=46, y=8 is safe.\n\nThen from there, I can go to y=9 at T=47.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nNow, similarly, to be at y=8 at T=46.\n\nHow to get there.\n\nI need to spend some extra time somewhere.\n\nSince y=2,3,4,5,6 are always safe, I can stay there for a turn.\n\nFor example, in the direct path, I am at y=5 at T=41, y=6 at T=42, y=7 at T=43.\n\nAt T=43, I am on y=7, safe.\n\nInstead of going up to y=8 at T=44, I can choose to stay at y=7 or go down.\n\nBut if I stay at y=7 at T=44, dangerous, so I cannot.\n\nIf I go down to y=6 at T=44.\n\nThen at T=44, I am on y=6, safe.\n\nThen I need to go up later.\n\nBut at T=45, y=7 and y=8 dangerous, so I cannot go to y=7 or y=8 at T=45.\n\nAt T=44, I am on y=6.\n\nI can choose action.\n\nIf I go up to y=7, at T=45 I am on y=7, but T=45 dangerous for y=7.\n\nCollision.\n\nIf I stay at y=6, then at T=45, on y=6, safe.\n\nThen at T=45, I can go up to y=7 at T=46? At T=45, choose U, then y_{46}=7.\n\nBut at T=46, I am on y=7.\n\nNow, T=46, is y=7 safe? Safe times for y=7: not at 44,45, so at T=46, safe.\n\nSimilarly, then I can go to y=8 at T=47.\n\nThen to y=9 at T=48.\n\nBut more turns.\n\nFrom y=6 at T=44, I could go directly to y=7 at T=45, but dangerous.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I have to wait at y=6 for one turn.\n\nLet's outline the sequence.\n\nStart: T=36, y=0, safe.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nTo minimize H, I should go up as much as possible until I have to wait.\n\nDirect path until T=43: y=7, safe.\n\nAt T=43, on y=7, safe.\n\nNow, if I go up, to y=8 at T=44, dangerous.\n\nSo I must not go up; I must go down or stay, but stay at T=44 dangerous, so only go down to y=6.\n\nSo choose D at T=43: then y_{44} = 7 -1 =6.\n\nAt T=44, on y=6, safe.\n\nNow, at T=44, on y=6, I can choose action.\n\nIf I go up to y=7, then at T=45, on y=7, but T=45 dangerous, collision.\n\nIf I stay, y_{45}=6, at T=45 on y=6, safe.\n\nThen at T=45, on y=6, choose U, go to y=7 at T=46.\n\nAt T=46, on y=7, safe (since T=46 not dangerous).\n\nThen at T=46, choose U, go to y=8 at T=47.\n\nAt T=47, on y=8, which is safe? Freeway 8 dangerous at 36,37,44,45, so T=47 safe.\n\nThen at T=47, choose U, go to y=9 at T=48.\n\nAt T=48, on y=9, done.\n\nNow, from start to T=48, y=9.\n\nNumber of turns: from T=36 to T=48, that is 12 turns? Positions over time.\n\nT=36: y=0\n\nAfter actions:\n\na_36: U, y_37=1\n\na_37: U, y_38=2\n\na_38: U, y_39=3\n\na_39: U, y_40=4\n\na_40: U, y_41=5\n\na_41: U, y_42=6\n\na_42: U, y_43=7\n\nNow at T=43, on y=7, choose a_43: D, so y_{44} = 7 -1 =6\n\nAt T=44, on y=6, choose a_44: S (stay), so y_{45} =6\n\nAt T=45, on y=6, choose a_45: U, so y_{46} =7\n\nAt T=46, on y=7, choose a_46: U, y_{47}=8\n\nAt T=47, on y=8, choose a_47: U, y_{48}=9\n\nAt T=48, on y=9, done.\n\nSo I reached at T=48, with H=12 actions? From t=36 to t=47, actions a_36 to a_47, that is 12 actions, to be at y=9 at t=48.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, I think.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, and at turn t_1 + H - 1, y=9.\n\nHere t_1=36, at turn 48, y=9, so t_1 + H - 1 =48, so 36 + H -1 =48, H-1=12, H=13? Let's see.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =48, t_1=36, so 36 + H -1 =48, 35 + H =48, H=13.\n\nActions from t=36 to t=48-1=47? The turns for actions.\n\nThe sequence {a_t} for t = t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAt turn t, we perform action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, we are at position.\n\nIn the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" let's read.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t_1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\n\"such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nFrom the task: \"such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nAnd actions for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, we are at y=9.\n\nIn terms of time, at turn T, we are at y_T.\n\nAfter action a_t at turn t, we move to y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t, perform a_t, go to y_{t+1}.\n\nWe start at turn t_1, y_{t_1} = given.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, we are at y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut we want to reach y=9 at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\n\" such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9 \"\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor example, at turn t_1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nIn the action sequence, actions from t=t_1 to t=t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter performing a_{t_1 + H -1}, we are at y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, which means at the start of turn t_1 + H -1, we are at y=9, and we perform an action, but since we are at y=9, we might do S or D, but to reach, we need to be there at that turn.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think that at turn T, we are at y_T before action.\n\nI think I have confusion.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\nFrom game dynamics:\n\n\"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\"\n\nSo at turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nThen at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision at turn t: if on freeway y_t, and cars on y_t at turn t have 0 in span.\n\nWe start at turn t_1=36, y_{36}=0.\n\nWe perform actions a_{36}, a_{37}, ..., up to some a_{t_1 + H -1}, such that after these H actions, y_{t_1 + H} =9? No.\n\nThe condition is y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThat means at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at position y=9.\n\nThen, since we are at y=9, we don't need to move further, but we might perform an action at that turn, but it could be S.\n\nIn the sequence, we include action at turn t_1 + H -1, but since y=9, we can choose S.\n\nNow, in my earlier plan, I have at T=48, y=9.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =48, t_1=36, so 36 + H -1 =48, 35 + H =48, H=13.\n\nActions from t=36 to t=48-1=47, 12 actions? t from 36 to 47 inclusive, that is 12 turns.\n\nNumber of actions H: from t=36 to t=36 + H -1, so t=36,37,...,36+H-1.\n\nThis is H actions.\n\nSet equal to 47 for the last action: 36 + H -1 =47, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nThen t_1 + H -1 =36 +12 -1=47, and y_{47} should be 9.\n\nIn my sequence:\n\nAt T=47, what is y?\n\nFrom above:\n\nT=36: y=0\n\nT=37: y=1 (after a36 U)\n\n...\n\nLet's list y_t:\n\nt=36: y=0\n\nt=37: y=1 (after a36 U)\n\nt=38: y=2 (a37 U)\n\nt=39: y=3 (a38 U)\n\nt=40: y=4 (a39 U)\n\nt=41: y=5 (a40 U)\n\nt=42: y=6 (a41 U)\n\nt=43: y=7 (a42 U)\n\nAt t=43, choose a43=D, so y_{44} =7-1=6\n\nt=44: y=6\n\nAt t=44, choose a44=S, so y_{45}=6\n\nt=45: y=6\n\nAt t=45, choose a45=U, so y_{46}=7\n\nt=46: y=7\n\nAt t=46, choose a46=U, so y_{47}=8\n\nt=47: y=8\n\nBut we need y_{47}=9, but here y=8.\n\nThen at t=47, we need to go to y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=47, y=8, we choose a47=U, so y_{48}=9.\n\nThen at t=48, y=9.\n\nBut we want y at t_1 + H -1 =47 to be 9, which is not, it is 8.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =36 + H -1.\n\nSet this to 48 for y=9 at t=48.\n\nThen 36 + H -1 =48, H-1=12, H=13.\n\nThen actions from t=36 to t=36+12=48? t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1 =36 to 36+13-1=48? 36 to 48 inclusive? t=36 to t=48, that is 13 actions.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =48, so t from 36 to 48, H actions.\n\nFor example, t=36,37,...,48, that is 13 values.\n\nThen at turn 48, y=9.\n\nIn my sequence, with H=13:\n\nActions:\n\na36: U, to y37=1\n\na37: U, y38=2\n\n...\n\na42: U, y43=7 (at t=43)\n\na43: D, y44=6\n\na44: S, y45=6 (at t=45)\n\na45: U, y46=7\n\na46: U, y47=8\n\na47: U, y48=9\n\nThen at t=48, y=9.\n\nWe need to specify actions up to a_{47}, and at t=48, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 48, no action, since actions up to t=47.\n\nThe last action is at t=47 to reach y=9 at t=48.\n\nBut in the position, at turn t=48, we are at y=9, and we don't perform action, but the sequence is only for actions to reach.\n\nNow, in this case, H=13 turns? H is the number of actions, so 13 actions from t=36 to t=48? t=36 to t=47 for actions, 12 actions? I'm confused.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nThe sequence is {a_t} for t = t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter performing these H actions, we have y_{t_1 + H} = y_{t_1} + sum of Δy over H actions.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, before action, y is 9.\n\nThen we perform action a_{t_1 + H -1}, which might change it, but since we are at goal, we can choose S to stay.\n\nIn the problem, it says \"reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\", so at that turn, we are at 9.\n\nThen we choose an action, but it doesn't matter as long as we are there.\n\nTo be consistent, when we are at y=9, we can choose S.\n\nIn my sequence, I have y at t=47 is 8, not 9.\n\nTo have y at t=47 be 9.\n\nFrom start, to reach y=9 at turn T.\n\nMinimum T is 36 + 9 =45, since 9 steps up.\n\nBut at t=45, y=9.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at t=45, I need to have arrived earlier.\n\nWith actions: from t=36 to t=44, actions to increase y from 0 to 9.\n\nAt t=36: y=0\n\na36 U, y37=1\n\n...\n\na44 U, y45=9\n\nSo at t=45, y=9.\n\nBut in this case, at t=44, I was at y=8, which is dangerous, but at t=44, I am on y=8, and I perform action to go to y=9, but the position at t=44 is y=8, and collision occurs if dangerous, which it is.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=8 at t=44.\n\nTo be at y=9 at t=45, I must be at y=8 at t=44 to go up.\n\nBut y=8 at t=44 dangerous.\n\nSo impossible to reach y=9 at t=45 without being on y=8 at t=44.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=9 at t=46, I can be at y=8 at t=45, but y=8 at t=45 dangerous, so also impossible.\n\nt=45 y=8 dangerous.\n\nSo the earliest safe time to be at y=8 is t=46.\n\nThen at t=46, on y=8, safe, I can go to y=9 at t=47.\n\nSo be at y=9 at t=47.\n\nThen t_1 + H -1 =47, 36 + H -1 =47, H-1=11, H=12.\n\nActions from t=36 to t=36+11=47? t_1 to t_1 + H -1 =36 to 36+12-1=47.\n\nSo actions a36 to a47.\n\nAt turn 47, y=9.\n\nTo have y=9 at t=47, I need to be at y=8 at t=46, then a47=U to y48? No.\n\nAt turn t, y_t.\n\nTo have y_t=9 at turn t.\n\nFor example, at t=47, y_47=9.\n\nThat means at turn 47, before action, y=9.\n\nHow to get there.\n\nI can be at y=8 at t=46, then at t=46, choose a46=U, so y47=9.\n\nThen at t=47, y=9.\n\nAnd y=8 at t=46 is safe, as t=46 not dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, I need to be at y=8 at t=46.\n\nNow, from start, to reach y=8 at t=46.\n\nMinimum time to y=8 is t=44, but dangerous, so I need to take more time.\n\nI can go directly but slower to arrive later.\n\nFor example, stay at some safe level for one turn.\n\nSince y=5 is always safe, I can stay at y=5 for one turn.\n\nIn the direct path, I am at y=5 at t=41.\n\nAt t=41, on y=5, safe.\n\nInstead of going up, I can choose S, stay at y=5 for t=42.\n\nThen continue.\n\nLet's see the timeline.\n\nDirect path:\n\nt=36: y=0\n\nt=37: y=1\n\nt=38: y=2\n\nt=39: y=3\n\nt=40: y=4\n\nt=41: y=5\n\nAt t=41, on y=5, I can choose a41=S, so y42=5\n\nThen t=42: y=5\n\nAt t=42, choose a42=U, y43=6\n\nt=43: y=6\n\na43=U, y44=7\n\nBut at t=44, y=7, which is dangerous at t=44.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt t=41, y=5, choose U, go to y=6 at t=42 as before.\n\nt=42: y=6, choose S, stay, so y43=6\n\nt=43: y=6\n\nThen at t=43, choose U, y44=7\n\nBut t=44, y=7 dangerous.\n\nStill problem.\n\nTo avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at t=44,45, I need to be below at t=44.\n\nFor example, at t=43, be at y<=6.\n\ny=6 is safe at t=44.\n\nThen after t=45, go up.\n\nSo at t=44, be at y=6 or below.\n\nThen at t=45, be at y=6 or below, since y=7 and 8 dangerous.\n\ny=6 safe at t=45.\n\nThen at t=46, go to y=7, etc.\n\nBut I need to reach high.\n\nSo let's plan:\n\nFrom start, go up to y=6 by some time.\n\nEarliest to y=6: from y=0 to y=6, 6 steps, at t=42: y=6.\n\nt=36:0, t=37:1, t=38:2, t=39:3, t=40:4, t=41:5, t=42:6.\n\nAt t=42, y=6, safe.\n\nNow, I need to not go to y=7 immediately, because if I go up at t=42, y43=7, then at t=43 on y=7 safe, but then at t=43 I have to choose action for t=44.\n\nIf I go up to y=8 at t=44, dangerous; if stay, dangerous at t=44; if down, to y=6.\n\nSo better to stay at y=6 for one or two turns.\n\nAt t=42, on y=6, choose a42=S, so y43=6\n\nt=43: y=6, choose a43=S, y44=6\n\nt=44: y=6, safe (since y=6 safe)\n\nAt t=44, choose a44=U, y45=7\n\nBut at t=45, y=7, dangerous! t=45 y=7 dangerous.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf at t=44, I choose to stay, y45=6, then t=45: y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=45, on y=6, choose a45=U, y46=7\n\nt=46: y=7, safe (t=46 not dangerous)\n\nThen a46=U, y47=8\n\nt=47: y=8, safe (t=47 not 44 or 45)\n\nThen a47=U, y48=9\n\nt=48: y=9\n\nBut we need y at t_1 + H -1 =47 to be 9, but here at t=47, y=8.\n\nTo have y=9 at t=47, I need to be at y=8 at t=46, then a47=U to y48=9, but at t=47, y=9 only if I define y at start of turn.\n\nAt turn t, y_t is position at start.\n\nAfter action, y_{t+1}.\n\nSo to have y_t =9 at turn t, I must have arrived by previous action.\n\nFor y_47=9, it means at turn 47, before action, y=9.\n\nThat requires that at turn 46, after action or before.\n\nAt turn 46, I am at y_46, choose a46, go to y_47.\n\nIf I choose a46 such that y_47=9, then at turn 47, y_47=9.\n\nFor example, if at turn 46, I am at y=8, then a46=U, y47=9.\n\nThen at turn 47, y=9.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=8 at turn 46, I need to have y_46=8.\n\nNow, with the waiting.\n\nStart: t=36 y=0\n\nGo up to y=6 quickly:\n\na36 U, y37=1\n\na37 U, y38=2\n\na38 U, y39=3\n\na39 U, y40=4\n\na40 U, y41=5\n\na41 U, y42=6\n\nt=42: y=6\n\nNow, at t=42, I need to wait because if I go up now, I hit dangerous zone.\n\nSo at t=42, choose S, a42=S, so y43=6\n\nt=43: y=6\n\nAt t=43, choose S, a43=S, y44=6\n\nt=44: y=6\n\nAt t=44, choose U, a44=U, y45=7\n\nBut at t=45, y=7, which is dangerous at t=45.\n\nCollision.\n\nAt t=44, after staying, choose not to go up yet.\n\nAt t=44, on y=6, choose S, a44=S, y45=6\n\nt=45: y=6\n\nNow t=45, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=45, choose U, a45=U, y46=7\n\nt=46: y=7, safe\n\nAt t=46, choose U, a46=U, y47=8\n\nt=47: y=8\n\nAt t=47, choose U, a47=U, y48=9\n\nBut we need y at t=47 to be 9, but here y=8.\n\nSo to have y47=9, I need to be at y=8 at t=46, then a46=U to y47=9.\n\nBut in this, at t=46, y=7, so a46=U to y47=8, not 9.\n\nSo I need to be at y=8 at t=46.\n\nHow to reach y=8 at t=46.\n\nFrom start, to y=8 in 10 steps? From t=36 to t=46, 10 turns.\n\nAt t=36: y=0\n\nAfter 10 actions, at t=46, y=8.\n\nBut each action can increase by at most 1, so from 0, after 10 actions, y<=10, but we can have less.\n\nTo reach y=8 at t=46.\n\nI can go up most of the way and stay once.\n\nFor example, go up 8 times in 10 actions, with 2 stays.\n\nBut where to stay.\n\nSince lower levels are safe, stay at low level.\n\nFor example, at t=36, y=0, choose S, stay at y=0 for one turn, but y=0 safe, but not necessary.\n\nGo up to y=5 or something.\n\nLet's list the actions.\n\nSet t=36: y=0\n\nI want y46=8.\n\nNumber of actions from t=36 to t=45, 10 actions (t=36 to 45 for actions, determining y37 to y46).\n\nActions a36 to a45 determine y37 to y46.\n\ny46 = y36 + sum_{k=36 to 45} Δy_k = 0 + sum of 10 Δy.\n\nEach Δy = +1,0,-1.\n\nI want y46=8, so sum of 10 Δy =8.\n\nThus, number of U minus number of D =8, and number of S = total - U - D.\n\nLet U be number of up actions, D down, S stay, U + D + S =10, U - D =8.\n\nThen U - D =8, U + D + S =10, so 2U + S =18, so U=9, D=1, S=0 or U=8, D=0, S=2, etc.\n\nPossible: 8 U, 0 D, 2 S or 9 U, 1 D, 0 S, etc.\n\nBut to minimize time, but we are fixing the arrival time.\n\nNow, I need to be at safe positions during the path.\n\nTo avoid the dangerous times, I should not be on y=7 or y=8 at t=44,45.\n\nIn particular, at t=44 and t=45, I should be on y<=6 or y=9, but y=9 not yet.\n\ny=6 safe.\n\nSimilarly, at other times, most are safe.\n\nFor example, I can be at y=5 at t=41, then stay there for two turns.\n\nThen go up.\n\nLet's define the sequence.\n\nStart t=36: y=0\n\na36: U, y37=1\n\na37: U, y38=2\n\na38: U, y39=3\n\na39: U, y40=4\n\na40: U, y41=5\n\nt=41: y=5, safe.\n\nAt t=41, choose a41=S, so y42=5\n\nt=42: y=5, safe.\n\nAt t=42, choose a42=S, so y43=5\n\nt=43: y=5, safe.\n\nAt t=43, choose a43=U, y44=6\n\nt=44: y=6, safe.\n\nAt t=44, choose a44=U, y45=7\n\nBut at t=45, y=7, dangerous! t=45 is dangerous for y=7.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt t=43, after staying, choose not to go up yet.\n\nt=43: y=5, choose S, a43=S, y44=5\n\nt=44: y=5, safe\n\nThen at t=44, choose U, a44=U, y45=6\n\nt=45: y=6, safe\n\nThen at t=45, choose U, a45=U, y46=7\n\nt=46: y=7, safe\n\nThen a46: U, y47=8\n\nt=47: y=8\n\nBut we need y47=9 for the goal at t=47.\n\ny47=8, not 9.\n\nThen to reach y=9 at t=48, but we want at t=47.\n\nTo have y47=9, I need y46=8, then a46=U to y47=9.\n\nBut in above, at t=46, y=7.\n\nSo I need to be at y=8 at t=46.\n\nFrom above, at t=44, I am at y=5 or 6.\n\nLet's go faster earlier.\n\nFor example, go up to y=6 quickly, then stay at y=6 for some turns.\n\nt=36: y=0, a36 U, y37=1\n\na37 U, y38=2\n\na38 U, y39=3\n\na39 U, y40=4\n\na40 U, y41=5\n\na41 U, y42=6\n\nt=42: y=6\n\nNow, I need to stay at y=6 until after t=45.\n\nAt t=42, choose S, a42=S, y43=6\n\nt=43: y=6, choose S, a43=S, y44=6\n\nt=44: y=6, choose S, a44=S, y45=6\n\nt=45: y=6, safe\n\nThen at t=45, choose U, a45=U, y46=7\n\nt=46: y=7, safe\n\nAt t=46, choose U, a46=U, y47=8\n\nt=47: y=8\n\nBut we need y47=9.\n\nSo at t=47, y=8, not 9.\n\nThen a47 U, y48=9, t=48 y=9.\n\nBut for y47=9, not satisfied.\n\nTo have y47=9, I must have a46 such that from y46, to y47=9.\n\nSo y46 must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y46=8, a46=U to y47=9.\n\nIf y46=9, a46=S or D, but to reach, better U.\n\nBut y46=9, then at t=46 already at 9.\n\nBut we can do that.\n\nFor example, if I reach y=9 earlier, but with dangerous, not possible.\n\nEarliest safe to be at y=9 is t=47, from y=8 at t=46.\n\nSo y46=8, a46=U, y47=9.\n\nSo I need to be at y=8 at t=46.\n\nHow to be at y=8 at t=46.\n\nFrom start, in 10 actions (a36 to a45), determine y46.\n\ny46 = 0 + sum of Δy from a36 to a45.\n\n10 actions.\n\nWant y46=8, so sum Δy =8 over 10 actions.\n\nThus, net +8, with 2 stays or 1 down and 1 up more, etc.\n\nFor example, 8 U, 2 S, 0 D.\n\nOr 9 U, 1 D, 0 S, etc.\n\nNow, I need to ensure that during the path, no collision.\n\nDangerous points are at t=44,45 for y=7 and y=8.\n\nSo at t=44 and t=45, I should not be on y=7 or y=8.\n\nSince I will be at y=8 at t=46, which is after.\n\nAt t=44 and t=45, I should be on y<=6 or y=9, but not possible.\n\ny<=6 safe.\n\nSimilarly, other times, most y are safe except specific.\n\nFor example, at t=43, y=7 is safe, as we saw.\n\nSo I can be on y=7 at t=43.\n\nBut not at t=44,45.\n\nSo in the sequence, I can be at y=6 or below at t=44 and t=45.\n\nNow, to reach y=8 at t=46.\n\nI can go up to y=6 by t=42, as before.\n\nThen at t=42, y=6.\n\nI need to go to y=8 by t=46.\n\nFrom t=42 to t=46, 4 actions: a42, a43, a44, a45 determining y43 to y46.\n\ny46 = y42 + Δy42 + Δy43 + Δy44 + Δy45\n\ny42=6, want y46=8, so Δy42 + Δy43 + Δy44 + Δy45 =2.\n\nSo net +2 over 4 actions.\n\nFor example, two U and two S, or one U and one D and two U, but net +2.\n\nSimplest: two U and two S.\n\nNow, I need to place the actions such that at t=44 and t=45, I am not on y=7 or y=8.\n\nAt t=44, y44 position.\n\ny44 depends on previous.\n\nSet y42=6\n\nAt t=42, choose action.\n\nIf I choose U, then y43=7\n\nBut at t=43, y=7 safe, as t=43 not dangerous.\n\nThen at t=43, on y=7, I need to choose action for y44.\n\nIf I choose U, y44=8, but at t=44, y=8 dangerous.\n\nIf I choose S, y44=7, at t=44 y=7 dangerous.\n\nIf I choose D, y44=6, at t=44 y=6 safe.\n\nThen from there, I need to go up.\n\nBut y44=6.\n\nThen to reach y46=8, I need y46=8.\n\ny44=6, then y45 and y46.\n\nIf I choose a44 U, y45=7, but at t=45 y=7 dangerous.\n\nIf a44 S, y45=6, then a45 U, y46=7, not 8.\n\nIf a44 U to y45=7, dangerous.\n\nSo not good.\n\nAt t=42, instead of going up, I stay.\n\ny42=6\n\nAt t=42, choose S, a42=S, y43=6\n\nt=43: y=6\n\nAt t=43, choose U, a43=U, y44=7\n\nBut at t=44, y=7 dangerous.\n\nCollision.\n\nAt t=43, choose S, a43=S, y44=6\n\nt=44: y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=44, choose U, a44=U, y45=7\n\nt=45: y=7 dangerous.\n\nSame issue.\n\nTo avoid, at t=44, choose S, a44=S, y45=6\n\nt=45: y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=45, choose U, a45=U, y46=7\n\nt=46: y=7\n\nBut I need y46=8, here y=7.\n\nThen a46 U, y47=8, not 8 at t=46.\n\nSo not y46=8.\n\nTo have y46=8, from y44=6, I need to increase by 2 in two actions, but with the constraint at t=45.\n\nFrom y44=6 at t=44.\n\nThen a44 and a45 determine y45 and y46.\n\ny46 = y44 + Δy44 + Δy45\n\nWant y46=8, so 6 + Δy44 + Δy45 =8, so Δy44 + Δy45 =2.\n\nSo both U, or one U and one S with extra, but Δy +1 or 0 or -1, so only both U: Δy44=+1, Δy45=+1.\n\nThen y45 = y44 + Δy44 =6+1=7\n\ny46 = y45 + Δy45 =7+1=8\n\nBut at t=45, y45=7, which is dangerous.\n\nCollision.\n\nIf I have only one U, but then y46=7 or less, not 8.\n\nSo impossible to have y46=8 without being on y=7 at t=45, which is dangerous.\n\nBecause to go from y=6 to y=8 in two steps, I must be at y=7 at some point, and at t=45, it is dangerous.\n\nSpecifically, if I go from y44=6 to y45=7 to y46=8, then at t=45, I am on y=7, dangerous.\n\nIf I go directly, but I can only change by 1, so no.\n\nSo it is impossible to be at y=8 at t=46 without being on y=7 at t=45 or earlier, but at t=45 it is dangerous if on y=7.\n\nBut at t=45, if I am on y=7, it is dangerous, so I cannot be on y=7 at t=45.\n\nSimilarly for y=8 at t=44 or 45.\n\nTo be at y=8 at t=46, I must have been at y=7 at t=45 or t=46, but at t=45 y=7 dangerous, at t=46 I am at y=7 if I arrive, but to go to y=8, I choose action at t=46.\n\nAt t=46, I am at y=7, choose U to go to y=8 at t=47, but at t=46, I am on y=7, which is safe at t=46.\n\nThen y47=8.\n\nBut I need y46=8, not y47.\n\nSo to have y46=8, I must be at y=8 at turn 46, which requires that at turn 45, I was at y=7 or y=8 or y=9, and I chose action to have y46=8.\n\nBut at turn 45, if I am at y=7, it is dangerous, collision.\n\nIf at y=8, also dangerous.\n\nIf at y=9, I can choose D or S, but not to 8.\n\nSo it is impossible to be at y=8 at t=46 without being at dangerous position at t=45.\n\nSimilarly, for any time, to be at y=8, I must have come from y=7 or y=9, but at the dangerous times, it's bad.\n\nBut for t=46, to be at y=8, I must have been at y=7 at t=45 or y=8 at t=45 or y=9 at t=45.\n\nBut at t=45, y=7 and y=8 are dangerous, so if I am on them, collision.\n\ny=9 at t=45 is possible? But to be at y=9 at t=45, I need to be at y=8 at t=44, which is dangerous at t=44, collision.\n\nSo it is impossible to be at y=8 or y=9 at t=45 or t=46 safely for this context.\n\nThe only way is to be at y=8 at t=47 or later.\n\nFor example, at t=46, on y=7, safe, then a46=U, y47=8, at t=47 y=8 safe.\n\nThen a47=U, y48=9, at t=48 y=9.\n\nThen for the goal, to have y at t_1 + H -1 =9, set t=48, then 36 + H -1 =48, H-1=12, H=13.\n\nActions from t=36 to t=47 for 12 actions.\n\nAt t=48, y=9.\n\nAnd in the sequence, we can have the path I had earlier with waiting.\n\nBut in that path, at t=47, y=8, not 9.\n\nWith H=13, t from 36 to 48, y=9 at t=48.\n\nAnd the sequence can be:\n\na36: U\n\na37: U\n\na38: U\n\na39: U\n\na40: U\n\na41: U\n\na42: U  // y43=7 at t=43\n\nAt t=43, y=7, choose a43: D  // to avoid being at high level at dangerous time\n\ny44=6\n\nt=44: y=6\n\na44: S  // stay\n\ny45=6\n\nt=45: y=6\n\na45: U\n\ny46=7\n\nt=46: y=7\n\na46: U\n\ny47=8\n\nt=47: y=8\n\na47: U\n\ny48=9\n\nt=48: y=9\n\nNow, at t=48, y=9.\n\nH=13, actions from t=36 to t=47.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =36 +13-1=48, yes.\n\nAnd y48=9.\n\nNow, check if all positions are safe.\n\nt=36: y=0, safe\n\nt=37: y=1, freeway 1, not dangerous (52-55), safe\n\nt=38: y=2, safe\n\nt=39: y=3, safe\n\nt=40: y=4, safe\n\nt=41: y=5, safe\n\nt=42: y=6, safe\n\nt=43: y=7, freeway 7, dangerous at 36,37,44,45; t=43 not, safe\n\nt=44: y=6, freeway 6, safe\n\nt=45: y=6, freeway 6, safe\n\nt=46: y=7, freeway 7, t=46 not dangerous, safe\n\nt=47: y=8, freeway 8, dangerous at 36,37,44,45; t=47 not, safe\n\nt=48: y=9, safe, goal.\n\nAll safe.\n\nAnd H=13.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nH=13, but minimal?\n\nFor example, if I can reach in 12 actions.\n\nSet H=12, then t_1 + H -1 =36+12-1=47, y47=9.\n\nTo have y47=9, I need to be at y=8 at t=46, then a47=U to y48=9, but at t=47, y=9.\n\nAt t=46, y=8.\n\nBut as before, to be at y=8 at t=46, I must have been at y=7 at t=45 or something, but at t=45, y=7 dangerous, so impossible to be at y=8 at t=46 without collision or being at dangerous position.\n\nSimilarly, directly to y=9 at t=47 requires being at y=8 at t=46, same issue.\n\nSo H=13 seems minimal.\n\nPerhaps go down at earlier point.\n\nFor example, at t=41, y=5, instead of going up, go down to y=4, then come back, but that would take more turns, not better.\n\nSo H=13 is the minimal.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions.\n\nFrom above:\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U  // to y=6 at t=42? Let's list actions and positions.\n\nActions at turn t affect y_{t+1}.\n\nBut position at turn t is y_t.\n\nFor the sequence:\n\nAt turn 36: action U, so y37=1\n\nTurn 37: action U, y38=2\n\nTurn 38: U, y39=3\n\nTurn 39: U, y40=4\n\nTurn 40: U, y41=5\n\nTurn 41: U, y42=6\n\nTurn 42: U, y43=7\n\nIn my sequence, at turn 42, I have action U to y43=7.\n\nThen turn 43: action D, so y44=6\n\nTurn 44: action S, so y45=6\n\nTurn 45: action U, y46=7\n\nTurn 46: action U, y47=8\n\nTurn 47: action U, y48=9\n\nAnd y at t=48 is 9.\n\nActions from turn 36 to 47.\n\nIn the sequence for the answer.\n\nAlso, at turn 41, I have U, but in the list above, it's fine.\n\nTo write the answer.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 42, I have U to go to y=7 at t=43, which is safe, then at t=43, I go down to avoid the danger.\n\nNow, for the boxed answer.\n\nH=13\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: D\n\nTurn 44: S\n\nTurn 45: U\n\nTurn 46: U\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nAnd at turn 48, y=9, but no action at turn 48.\n\nIn the sequence, actions up to turn 47.\n\nNow, to confirm the car on freeway 6, but it was only dangerous at t=36, so fine.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nI think this works.\n\nPerhaps I can have less by not going to y=7 at t=43.\n\nFor example, at turn 41, after y=5 at t=41, I choose S to stay at y=5 for t=42.\n\nThen at turn 42, choose U to y=6 at t=43.\n\nThen turn 43, choose U to y=7 at t=44, but dangerous, so not.\n\nThen I have to go down or stay.\n\nBut not better.\n\nSo I think H=13 is minimal.\n\nThus the sequence.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 36\\) with the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), the sequence of actions must avoid collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at all times. The dangerous times for each freeway are derived from the car states at turn 36 and their movement rules:\n\n- Freeway 1 is dangerous at turns 52, 53, 54, 55.\n- Freeways 2, 3, 4, and 5 are always safe.\n- Freeway 6 is dangerous only at turn 36, so safe for turns ≥ 37.\n- Freeway 7 is dangerous at turns 36, 37, 44, 45.\n- Freeway 8 is dangerous at turns 36, 37, 44, 45.\n\nThe minimal \\(H\\) is 13, meaning the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 48 (since \\(y_{t_1 + H - 1} = y_{36 + 13 - 1} = y_{48} = 9\\)). The sequence of actions from turn 36 to turn 47 ensures the player avoids all dangerous positions:\n\n- At turn 36, start at \\(y = 0\\) (safe, not a freeway).\n- Move up to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 37 (freeway 1 safe at turn 37).\n- Continue up to \\(y = 6\\) by turn 42 (all intermediate freeways safe).\n- At turn 43, on \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7 safe at turn 43), move down to \\(y = 6\\) to avoid being on \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) at dangerous turns 44 and 45.\n- Stay at \\(y = 6\\) for turn 44 (freeway 6 safe).\n- Stay at \\(y = 6\\) for turn 45 (freeway 6 safe).\n- Move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 46 (freeway 7 safe at turn 46).\n- Move up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 47 (freeway 8 safe at turn 47).\n- Move up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 48, reaching the goal.\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{Turn } 36: & U \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 37: & U \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 38: & U \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 39: & U \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 40: & U \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 41: & U \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 42: & U \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 43: & D \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 44: & S \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 45: & U \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 46: & U \\\\\n&\\text{Turn } 47: & U \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars. The cars are on freeways y=1 to y=8, and I start at y=3. Collision happens if at any turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movements. The cars move at constant speeds, either left or right. Since the grid is on the x-axis, but we're only concerned with when x=0, I think. The collision is defined based on whether 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t_1 = 39.\n\nFor each freeway, I need to find when a car would have 0 in its span at some turn.\n\nAlso, note that when I move, at turn T, I'm on y_T. If I move to a different y at turn T, I'm not on that new y until the next turn? Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd about moving: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo at turn T, I am on freeway y_T, and I check for collision on that freeway at that turn. When I take an action at turn T, it determines y_{T+1}, but at turn T, I'm still on y_T.\n\nLet me clarify the timing.\n\nAt the start of turn t, I am at position y_t.\n\nThen I choose action a_t: U, D, or S.\n\nThen y_{t+1} is set based on a_t.\n\nBut during turn t, when collision is checked, I am at y_t, and we look at the cars on freeway y_t at turn t.\n\nThen after the action, I move to y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nIn the collision rule: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\ny_T is my position at turn T, I think.\n\nAnd turn T is the current turn index.\n\nFor car update, at turn T, the span is given for that turn.\n\nIn this case, at turn t_1 = 39, we have the car states given.\n\nFor future turns, we can compute the span.\n\nAlso, for the cars, the span is defined with head and tail, and direction.\n\nFor left-moving, span is [h, τ] but with h decreasing, and for right-moving, [τ, h] with h increasing? Let me see.\n\nFrom the update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, h and τ decrease.\n\nBut [h, τ] with h and τ, but in the span, it might be that h > τ or h < τ? The notation is a bit ambiguous.\n\nLook at the car state given.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (-39, -50, right, 3)\n\nDirection is right, so for right-moving, it says: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1, it says \"(-39, -50, right, 3)\"\n\nNow, for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] with τ and h, but here it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed), so I need to interpret what is head and tail.\n\nIt says: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor freeway 1: head h = -39, tail τ = -50, direction right.\n\nFor right-moving, from the update: Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\n\nAt T=t_1, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-50, -39] since τ = -50, h = -39.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h, τ] with h decreasing.\n\nBut in this case, all cars given are right-moving, I think.\n\nLet's list all cars:\n\nFreeway 1: (head -39, tail -50, right, 3) so at t_1=39, span is [τ, h] = [-50, -39] for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (-36, -47, right, 12) → span at t_1: [-47, -36]\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2? (-36, -47, right, 12) → [-47, -36]\n\nFreeway 4: same, (-36, -47, right, 12) → [-47, -36]\n\nFreeway 5: same, (-36, -47, right, 12) → [-47, -36]\n\nFreeway 6: two cars: (-36, -47, right, 12) and (36, 25, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: (-36, -47, right, 12) → span [-47, -36]\n\nSecond car: (36, 25, right, 12) → head 36, tail 25, direction right, so span [τ, h] = [25, 36]\n\nFreeway 7: (-30, -41, right, 6) and (18, 7, right, 6)\n\nFirst: (-30, -41, right, 6) → span [-41, -30]\n\nSecond: (18, 7, right, 6) → span [7, 18]\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7, (-30, -41, right, 6) and (18, 7, right, 6) → spans [-41, -30] and [7, 18]\n\nNow, I start at y=3 at turn t_1=39.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny from 0 to 9, so from 3 to 9, I need to go up 6 units, so minimum 6 turns if I go up every turn, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars.\n\nBut going down might not help since I need to go up, but I have to avoid collisions.\n\nNow, collision at turn T if I am on freeway k at that turn, and for that freeway, at turn T, 0 is in the span of some car.\n\nSince the cars are moving, I need to find for each freeway, when 0 is covered by a car.\n\nAlso, for multiple cars on a freeway, if any car has 0 in span, it's collision.\n\nNow, the key is that I can be on a freeway only when no car covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nMoreover, when I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, so I need to ensure that when I am on a freeway, it's safe at that turn.\n\nNow, I need to find a sequence of actions to go from y=3 to y=9.\n\nThe actions: U for up, D for down, S for stay.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t = +1 for U, -1 for D, 0 for S, and y clamped to [0,9], but since we're going up, probably no issue with bounds.\n\nStart at y=3, target y=9.\n\nI need to go through freeways 4,5,6,7,8 to reach 9.\n\ny=9 is the top, but freeways are y=1 to 8, and y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think. The vertical axis y=0,1,2,...,9, but freeways are only for y=1 to 8, where cars are.\n\nFrom the problem: \"freeways y=1, …, 8\" and \"position (0, y_t)\", so y_t is the row.\n\nCollision only on freeways y=1 to 8. On y=0 and y=9, there are no cars, so no collision possible. I can be on y=0 or y=9 safely.\n\nBut I need to reach (0,9), which is y=9.\n\nAt y=9, no freeway, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 safe.\n\nBut I start at y=3, which is freeway 3.\n\nFreeway k is at y=k, I assume.\n\nYes.\n\nSo at turn t_1=39, I am on y=3.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find the times when x=0 is occupied by a car.\n\nThat is, for a given freeway k, at turn T, if there is a car such that 0 is in its span at T.\n\nSince cars move continuously, but we have discrete turns.\n\nLet me compute for each freeway the times when it is occupied at x=0.\n\nFirst, for freeway k, the cars on it.\n\nLet t_1 = 39.\n\nFor a car, at turn T, span is as given.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: only one car: right-moving, s=3, span at T: [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-50 + 3(T-39), -39 + 3(T-39)]\n\nSet min and max.\n\nLet Δt = T - t_1 = T - 39.\n\nSo for this car, span at T: [-50 + 3Δt, -39 + 3Δt]\n\n0 is in span if -50 + 3Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -39 + 3Δt\n\nSo -50 + 3Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -39 + 3Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -50 + 3Δt ≤ 0 => 3Δt ≤ 50 => Δt ≤ 50/3 ≈ 16.666, so Δt ≤ 16 since integer.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -39 + 3Δt => 39 ≤ 3Δt => Δt ≥ 13.\n\nSo for Δt from 13 to 16 inclusive.\n\nT = t_1 + Δt = 39 + Δt, so T from 39+13=52 to 39+16=55.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nBut freeway 1 is y=1, I might not need to go there, but I need to consider when I am on it.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: one car, (-36,-47,right,12), span at T: [-47 + 12Δt, -36 + 12Δt]\n\n0 in span: -47 + 12Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -36 + 12Δt\n\nFirst: -47 + 12Δt ≤ 0 => 12Δt ≤ 47 => Δt ≤ 47/12 ≈ 3.916, so Δt ≤ 3\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -36 + 12Δt => 36 ≤ 12Δt => Δt ≥ 3\n\nSo Δt = 3\n\nThus T = 39 + 3 = 42\n\nOnly at turn 42.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, one car (-36,-47,right,12), so same as above, occupied only at T=42.\n\nFreeway 4: same, one car (-36,-47,right,12), occupied only at T=42.\n\nFreeway 5: same, occupied only at T=42.\n\nNow freeway 6: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-36,-47,right,12), same as above, span [-47+12Δt, -36+12Δt], occupied at Δt=3, T=42.\n\nSecond car: (36,25,right,12), head 36, tail 25, direction right, so span at T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [25 + 12Δt, 36 + 12Δt]\n\n0 in span: 25 + 12Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 36 + 12Δt\n\nBut 25 + 12Δt ≥ 25 >0 for Δt≥0, so left part 25+12Δt ≤0 is impossible since 25+12Δt ≥25>0. Thus 0 is never in span for this car. So only the first car matters for freeway 6.\n\nThus freeway 6 occupied only at T=42.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-30,-41,right,6), span at T: [-41 + 6Δt, -30 + 6Δt]\n\n0 in span: -41 + 6Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -30 + 6Δt\n\nFirst: -41 + 6Δt ≤ 0 => 6Δt ≤ 41 => Δt ≤ 41/6 ≈ 6.833, so Δt ≤ 6\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -30 + 6Δt => 30 ≤ 6Δt => Δt ≥ 5\n\nSo Δt from 5 to 6 inclusive, T=39+5=44 to 39+6=45.\n\nSecond car: (18,7,right,6), span [7 + 6Δt, 18 + 6Δt]\n\n7 + 6Δt ≥7>0, so 0 never in span.\n\nThus only first car matters, freeway 7 occupied at T=44 and 45.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same as freeway 7, cars (-30,-41,right,6) and (18,7,right,6), so occupied at T=44 and 45 only by first car.\n\nNow, also freeway 1 we have occupied at T=52 to 55, but since I start at y=3 and go up, I might not go to y=1, so probably not relevant.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nBut I need to consider the path from y=3 to y=9.\n\ny=3 is freeway 3, which is occupied at T=42.\n\nI start at turn 39, y=3.\n\nAt turn 39, I am on y=3. Is it occupied? At T=39, Δt=0.\n\nFor freeway 3: car span [-47 +12*0, -36+12*0] = [-47,-36], which does not include 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 39, all freeways are safe at that turn, I think, except possibly, but let's check.\n\nAt t_1=39, for each:\n\nFreeway 1: span [-50,-39], 0 not in.\n\nFreeway 2: [-47,-36], 0 not in.\n\nFreeway 3: same, [-47,-36], 0 not in.\n\nFreeway 4: same, [-47,-36], 0 not in.\n\nFreeway 5: same, [-47,-36], 0 not in.\n\nFreeway 6: first car [-47,-36], 0 not; second car [25,36], 0 not.\n\nFreeway 7: first [-41,-30], 0 not; second [7,18], 0 not.\n\nFreeway 8: similar, safe.\n\nSo at turn 39, I am safe at y=3.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nMinimum turns: from y=3 to y=9, difference 6, so if I go up every turn, I can reach in 6 turns: to y=4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on a freeway when it is occupied.\n\nNow, the occupations:\n\nFreeway 3 (y=3) occupied only at T=42.\n\nFreeway 4 (y=4) occupied only at T=42? Freeway 4 has same car as 3, so yes, occupied at T=42.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5 same, occupied at T=42.\n\nFreeway 6 occupied at T=42.\n\nFreeway 7 occupied at T=44 and 45.\n\nFreeway 8 occupied at T=44 and 45.\n\nNow, y=9 is safe.\n\nI start at turn 39, y=3.\n\nIf I go up immediately, at turn 39, I choose action to go to y=4 at next turn.\n\nSequence:\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T, choose a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nAt turn 39, I am at y=3.\n\nI choose a_{39}, which determines y_{40}.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, collision at turn T based on y_T and cars at T.\n\nFor example, at turn 39, y=3, safe, as above.\n\nNow, if I choose a_{39} = U, then y_{40} = 4.\n\nThen at turn 40, I am at y=4.\n\nIs freeway 4 occupied at T=40?\n\nΔt = T - t_1 = 40 - 39 =1\n\nSpan for freeway 4 car: [-47 +12*1, -36+12*1] = [-35, -24], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=5 at turn 41: y_{41}=5, T=41, Δt=2, span [-47+24, -36+24] = [-23,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at turn 42, if I am at y=5, say, but freeway 5 is occupied at T=42.\n\nAt T=42, Δt=3, span [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0], which includes 0? -11 to 0.\n\n-11 ≤ 0 ≤ 0? 0 ≤ 0 is true, and -11 ≤0 true, so yes, 0 is included, so occupied.\n\nSimilarly, for y=3,4,5,6 all occupied at T=42.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nAt T=42, Δt=3:\n\nFreeway 3: span [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0], includes 0.\n\nFreeway 4: same, [-11,0]\n\nFreeway 5: same, [-11,0]\n\nFreeway 6: first car [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0], includes 0.\n\nSecond car not relevant.\n\nSo freeways 3,4,5,6 all occupied at T=42.\n\nNow, freeway 7 and 8 occupied at T=44 and 45.\n\nBack to the path.\n\nIf I go up directly:\n\nTurn 39: at y=3, safe. Choose U, so y_{40} =4\n\nTurn 40: at y=4, safe as above. Choose U, y_{41}=5\n\nTurn 41: at y=5, safe? At T=41, Δt=2, freeway 5: span [-47+24, -36+24] = [-23,-12], no 0, safe. Choose U, y_{42}=6\n\nTurn 42: at y=6, but at T=42, freeway 6 occupied, so collision if I am there.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf at turn 41 I am at y=5, I could choose S or D to avoid going to y=6.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nAt turn 41: y=5, safe. I can choose:\n\n- U: go to y=6 at next turn, but at turn 42, y=6 occupied, collision.\n\n- D: go to y=4, but at turn 42, y=4 occupied? At turn 42, if I am at y=4, it is occupied.\n\n- S: stay at y=5, but at turn 42, y=5 occupied.\n\nAll choices at turn 41 lead to being on a freeway that is occupied at turn 42.\n\nAt turn 41, I choose action for y_{42}.\n\nAt turn 41, I am at y=5.\n\nI choose a_{41}, which sets y_{42}.\n\nBut at turn 42, I will be at y_{42}, and if y_{42} is one of 3,4,5,6, it is occupied.\n\ny_{42} could be 4,5,6 or other, but from y=5, if I choose U, y_{42}=6; D, y_{42}=4; S, y_{42}=5. All are occupied at T=42.\n\nSo if I am at y=5 at turn 41, I cannot avoid collision at turn 42, because whatever I do, I end up on a bad freeway.\n\nTherefore, I must not be on y=5 at turn 41, or more generally, I need to be on a safe position before turn 42.\n\nAt turn 40, I am at y=4 (if I went up from 3).\n\nAt turn 40: y=4, safe. I can choose:\n\n- U: to y=5 at turn 41, then at turn 41 y=5, which is safe? At turn 41, y=5, is it occupied?\n\nT=41, Δt=2, freeway 5: span [-47+24, -36+24] = [-23,-12], no 0, so safe at T=41.\n\nBut then at turn 41, I have to choose action for turn 42, and as above, all choices lead to occupied freeway at turn 42.\n\n- D: from y=4 at turn 40, choose D, then y_{41}=3\n\nThen at turn 41, y=3, which at T=41, Δt=2, freeway 3: span [-47+24, -36+24] = [-23,-12], no 0, safe.\n\nThen at turn 41, y=3, I can choose action.\n\nIf I choose U, y_{42}=4, but at T=42, y=4 occupied.\n\nIf D, y_{42}=2, or S, y_{42}=3, both occupied if on 3 or 4? y=2 or y=3.\n\nFreeway 2: what is its occupation?\n\nEarlier I computed freeway 2 occupied only at T=42.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same car, occupied at T=42.\n\nSo at T=42, freeway 2,3,4,5,6 all occupied.\n\ny=2 is freeway 2, occupied.\n\ny=1: freeway 1, occupied only later, at T=52-55, not now.\n\nBut at turn 41, if I am at y=3, and I choose D, y_{42}=2.\n\nAt turn 42, y=2, freeway 2 occupied, collision.\n\nIf I choose S at turn 41, y_{42}=3, occupied, collision.\n\nIf I choose U, y_{42}=4, occupied, collision.\n\nSo from y=3 at turn 41, all choices lead to collision at turn 42.\n\nSimilarly, from y=4 at turn 40, if I choose D to go to y=3 at turn 41, same problem.\n\nIf at turn 40 I choose S, stay at y=4, then y_{41}=4.\n\nAt turn 41, y=4, which at T=41, Δt=2, freeway 4: span [-23,-12], no 0, safe.\n\nBut then at turn 41, I need to choose for turn 42, and as before, all actions lead to occupied y at turn 42.\n\nSo it seems that no matter what, if I am on y=3,4,5 at turn 40 or 41, I might be forced into collision at turn 42.\n\nBut I need to be not on freeways 2 to 6 at turn 42.\n\nThe safe freeways at turn 42 are y=1,7,8? y=1 is freeway, but freeway 1 is safe at turn 42? Let's check.\n\nFreeway 1: at T=42, Δt=3, span [-50 +3*3, -39 +3*3] = [-50+9, -39+9] = [-41,-30], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: at T=42, Δt=3, freeway 7 car: first car span [-41 +6*3, -30 +6*3] = [-41+18, -30+18] = [-23,-12], no 0.\n\nSecond car not relevant.\n\nSo freeway 7 safe at T=42.\n\nSimilarly freeway 8 same, safe at T=42.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are always safe, no cars.\n\nBut y=9 is the target.\n\nAt turn 42, freeways 1,7,8 are safe; freeways 2,3,4,5,6 occupied.\n\nSo to avoid collision at turn 42, I need to be on y=0,1,7,8, or 9 at turn 42.\n\nBut I start from y=3 at turn 39.\n\nNow, from turn 39 to 42, I have three actions: at t=39,40,41 to set y for t=40,41,42.\n\ny_{42} is determined by actions at t=40 and t=41? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 39, I set y_{40}.\n\nAt turn 40, I set y_{41}.\n\nAt turn 41, I set y_{42}.\n\nI need y_{42} to be one of 0,1,7,8,9.\n\nBut I am at y=3 at t=39.\n\nPossible to reach y=7,8,9 by turn 42?\n\nFrom y=3 to y=7, difference 4, but in 3 turns (from t=39 to set y_{40},41,42), I can move up to 3 steps.\n\ny_{42} = y_{39} + sum_{t=39}^{41} Δy_t\n\ny_{39} =3\n\nΔy_t each can be -1,0,+1.\n\nSo min y_{42} = 3 -3 =0, max =3+3=6.\n\nSo y_{42} can be from 0 to 6.\n\nI cannot reach y=7,8,9 by turn 42, since max is 6.\n\ny=6 is occupied at turn 42, as we saw.\n\ny=0,1 are possible and safe at turn 42.\n\ny=0 or y=1.\n\ny=1 is freeway 1, which is safe at turn 42, as computed.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 is safe.\n\nBut I need to go to y=9 eventually, so going down might delay.\n\nBut to avoid collision, I might need to go down to y=0 or y=1 at turn 42.\n\nThen from there, go up.\n\nBut let's see the occupation at other times.\n\nFirst, I need to survive turn 42.\n\nSo for turn 42, I need y_{42} to be 0 or 1.\n\nSince y=7,8,9 not reachable.\n\ny=42 must be 0 or 1.\n\nNow, from y=3 at turn 39, I need to get to y=0 or 1 by turn 42.\n\nWith three actions: at t=39,40,41.\n\ny_{42} = 3 + Δy_{39} + Δy_{40} + Δy_{41}\n\nEach Δy = -1,0,+1.\n\nSo to get y_{42} <=1, since 0 or 1.\n\ny_{42} = 3 + sum Δy\n\nSet to 0 or 1.\n\nSo sum Δy = -3 or -2.\n\nThat means I need to go down at least twice in three moves.\n\nFor example:\n\nOption: go down at t=39,40,41: then y_{40}=2, y_{41}=1, y_{42}=0\n\nOr down, down, stay: y_{40}=2, y_{41}=1, y_{42}=1\n\nOr down, stay, down: y_{40}=2, y_{41}=2, y_{42}=1? y_{41}=2, then down to y=1.\n\ny_{42} = y_{41} + Δy_{41}, but y_{41} depends on previous.\n\nLet's list possible sequences.\n\nAt turn 39: start y=3.\n\nChoose a_{39}, set y_{40}\n\nThen at turn 40: at y_{40}, choose a_{40}, set y_{41}\n\nAt turn 41: at y_{41}, choose a_{41}, set y_{42}\n\nNow y_{42} must be 0 or 1.\n\nCases:\n\nIf I go down at t=39: a_{39}=D, y_{40}=2\n\nThen at turn 40, y=2, which is freeway 2.\n\nIs it safe? At T=40, Δt=1, freeway 2: span [-47+12*1, -36+12*1] = [-35,-24], no 0, safe.\n\nThen I can choose a_{40}.\n\nIf a_{40}=D, y_{41}=1\n\nThen at turn 41, y=1, freeway 1, at T=41, Δt=2, span [-50+6, -39+6] = [-44,-33], no 0, safe.\n\nThen choose a_{41}: if D, y_{42}=0; if S, y_{42}=1; if U, y_{42}=2.\n\nBut y_{42} must be 0 or 1, so I can choose D or S at t=41.\n\nIf U, y_{42}=2, which is occupied at T=42, not good.\n\nSo choose D or S.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 40 I choose S: a_{40}=S, then y_{41}=2 (since y_{40}=2)\n\nThen at turn 41, y=2, safe at T=41? Freeway 2 at T=41, Δt=2, span [-47+24, -36+24]=[-23,-12], no 0, safe.\n\nThen choose a_{41}: if D, y_{42}=1; if S, y_{42}=2; if U, y_{42}=3.\n\ny_{42} must be 0 or 1, so only choose D, to y_{42}=1.\n\nIf choose S or U, y_{42}=2 or 3, occupied.\n\nIf at turn 40 I choose U: a_{40}=U, y_{41}=3\n\nThen at turn 41, y=3, safe at T=41 (span [-23,-12], no 0)\n\nThen choose a_{41}: if D, y_{42}=2; S, y_{42}=3; U, y_{42}=4.\n\nAll of which are occupied at T=42 (y=2,3,4), so collision. Not good.\n\nTherefore, from y_{40}=2, I should not choose U; only D or S, and then at t=41 choose accordingly.\n\nBut for y_{42}=0 or 1, the safe choices are:\n\n- a_{39}=D: to y_{40}=2\n\nThen a_{40}=D: to y_{41}=1\n\nThen a_{41}=D: to y_{42}=0 or S to y_{42}=1\n\nOr a_{40}=S: to y_{41}=2\n\nThen a_{41}=D: to y_{42}=1\n\nCannot choose a_{40}=U.\n\nIf I choose a_{39}=S, then y_{40}=3\n\nThen at turn 40, y=3, safe (T=40, Δt=1, freeway 3: [-35,-24], safe)\n\nThen choose a_{40}: if D, y_{41}=2; if S, y_{41}=3; if U, y_{41}=4\n\nThen at turn 41, need to set y_{42}.\n\nBut y_{42} must be 0 or 1.\n\nIf at t=40 I choose D: y_{41}=2\n\nThen at t=41, y=2, safe, then choose a_{41}: D to y_{42}=1; S to y_{42}=2; U to y_{42}=3\n\nTo have y_{42}=1, choose D.\n\ny_{42}=2 or 3 not allowed.\n\nIf at t=40 I choose S: y_{41}=3\n\nThen at t=41, y=3, choose a_{41}: D to y_{42}=2; S to y_{42}=3; U to y_{42}=4, all bad, cannot have y_{42}=0 or 1.\n\nIf at t=40 I choose U: y_{41}=4\n\nThen at t=41, y=4, choose a_{41}: D to y_{42}=3; S to y_{42}=4; U to y_{42}=5, all occupied at T=42, not good.\n\nSo only if I go down at t=39 or at least to lower y.\n\nThe only ways to have y_{42}=0 or 1:\n\n- Start with a_{39}=D: to y_{40}=2\n\nThen:\n\n- a_{40}=D: to y_{41}=1, then a_{41}=D or S to y_{42}=0 or 1\n\n- or a_{40}=S: to y_{41}=2, then a_{41}=D to y_{42}=1\n\nIf a_{39}=S: to y_{40}=3\n\nThen only if a_{40}=D: to y_{41}=2, then a_{41}=D to y_{42}=1\n\nCannot have a_{39}=U, because if a_{39}=U, y_{40}=4\n\nThen y_{41} could be 3,4,5; then y_{42} even higher, cannot be 0 or 1.\n\nSo possible sequences to avoid collision at turn 42:\n\nOption 1: a_{39}=D, a_{40}=D, a_{41}=D → y: 39:3, 40:2, 41:1, 42:0\n\nOption 2: a_{39}=D, a_{40}=D, a_{41}=S → y:39:3,40:2,41:1,42:1\n\nOption 3: a_{39}=D, a_{40}=S, a_{41}=D → y:39:3,40:2,41:2,42:1\n\nOption 4: a_{39}=S, a_{40}=D, a_{41}=D → y:39:3,40:3,41:2,42:1\n\nIn all cases, y_{42} is 0 or 1.\n\nNow, from there, I need to go to y=9.\n\nBut there is another problem: freeways 7 and 8 are occupied at turns 44 and 45.\n\nFirst, let's get past turn 42.\n\nNow, at turn 42, I am at y=0 or y=1.\n\ny=0 is safe, no freeway.\n\ny=1 is freeway 1, which at T=42 is safe, as span [-41,-30], no 0.\n\nNow, I need to go up to y=9.\n\nBut I have to avoid freeways 7 and 8 at turns 44 and 45.\n\nFirst, let's see when I can go up.\n\nAlso, freeway 1 has occupation later, but at T=52-55, which might be far, and I can be higher by then.\n\nNow, from turn 42 onwards.\n\nI need to reach y=9 asap.\n\nBut freeways 7 and 8 occupied at T=44 and 45.\n\nSo at turn 44 and 45, I cannot be on y=7 or 8.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 and 8 are freeways.\n\nNow, turns: turn 42,43,44,45,...\n\nSuppose at turn 42, I am at y=0 or y=1.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nMinimum turns from y=0 to y=9 is 9 turns, but I might be at y=1, so 8 turns.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on y=7 or 8 at turn 44 and 45.\n\nTurn 44 and 45 are specific times.\n\nNow, let t be absolute turn.\n\nTurn 42: I am at y_{42} = 0 or 1.\n\nThen at turn 42, I choose action for y_{43}.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, I need y_{44} and y_{45} not to be 7 or 8.\n\nBecause at turn 44 and 45, if I am on y=7 or 8, collision.\n\nAlso, at turn 44, freeway 7 and 8 occupied, so if y_{44}=7 or 8, collision.\n\nSimilarly for turn 45.\n\nNow, what about other freeways? At turn 44 and 45, freeways 2-6 are safe, since only occupied at T=42.\n\nFreeway 1 occupied later, but not now.\n\nFreeway 1 at T=44: Δt=44-39=5, span for freeway 1: [-50 +3*5, -39+3*5] = [-50+15, -39+15] = [-35,-24], no 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly at T=45: Δt=6, [-50+18, -39+18] = [-32,-21], no 0.\n\nSo only issue is y=7 and 8 at T=44 and 45.\n\nNow, I need to ensure that at turn 44, y_{44} ≠ 7 and y_{44} ≠ 8\n\nSimilarly at turn 45, y_{45} ≠ 7 and y_{45} ≠ 8\n\nNow, from turn 42, I start moving up.\n\nFirst, suppose I am at y=1 at turn 42. (since if at y=0, I might need to go up to y=1 first, but y=0 is safe, I can stay or move.)\n\nTo minimize time, better to be higher.\n\nAssume we are at y=1 at turn 42 for simplicity, but we have options.\n\nFrom the sequences above, at turn 42, y could be 0 or 1.\n\nIf y=0, I can go to y=1 quickly.\n\nBut let's take a case.\n\nI need to find minimal H.\n\nAlso, from turn 42, I need to go to y=9.\n\nNumber of steps needed: from y=1 to y=9, min 8 steps; from y=0, min 9 steps.\n\nBut with detours, might be more.\n\nBut I have to avoid y=7 and 8 at turns 44 and 45.\n\nNow, turns: turn 42,43,44,45,46,...\n\nAt turn 42, I am at y_{42}.\n\nChoose a_{42}, set y_{43}\n\nAt turn 43, choose a_{43}, set y_{44}\n\nAt turn 44, choose a_{44}, set y_{45}\n\nAt turn 45, choose a_{45}, set y_{46}, etc.\n\nI need y_{44} not 7 or 8, and y_{45} not 7 or 8.\n\nSince I am going up, y is increasing or staying.\n\ny_{42} is 0 or 1.\n\nLet me assume y_{42}=1 for now, which is better.\n\nSo at turn 42, y=1.\n\nI can choose to go up or stay or down, but down not useful.\n\na_{42}=U, then y_{43}=2\n\nOr S, y_{43}=1\n\nOr D, y_{43}=0, but not good.\n\nSo better go up.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, I need to control where I am at turn 44 and 45.\n\nTurn 44 is two steps from turn 42.\n\nFrom turn 42, at t=42, I set y_{43} with a_{42}\n\nAt t=43, set y_{44} with a_{43}\n\nSo y_{44} = y_{42} + Δy_{42} + Δy_{43}\n\nSimilarly, y_{45} = y_{44} + Δy_{44}\n\ny_{42} =1 (assume)\n\nThen y_{44} = 1 + Δy_{42} + Δy_{43}\n\nEach Δy = -1,0,+1.\n\nSo y_{44} can be from 1-2= -1, but clamped to 0, min 0, max 1+2=3.\n\ny_{44} =1 + Δy_{42} + Δy_{43}, so min 1-1-1= -1, but y>=0, so y=0; max 1+1+1=3.\n\nSimilarly, y_{45} depends on y_{44} and a_{44}.\n\nBut first, for y_{44}, it must not be 7 or 8, but y_{44} <=3 in this case, since from y=1 in two steps, max y=3, which is less than 7, so y_{44} <=3 <7, so automatically not 7 or 8. Similarly, y_{45} <= y_{44} +1 <=4 <7.\n\ny_{42}=1\n\nAfter two steps, y_{44} <= 1+2=3\n\nThen y_{45} <=3+1=4\n\nBoth less than 7, so no problem with freeways 7 and 8, since I am below them.\n\nThen I can keep going up.\n\nBut freeways 7 and 8 are at y=7 and 8, and I am at y<=4 at turn 45, so safe.\n\nThen I can go directly to y=9.\n\nBut let's confirm the turns.\n\nFirst, from turn 42, y=1.\n\nAt turn 42: choose U, y_{43}=2\n\nTurn 43: at y=2, choose U, y_{44}=3\n\nTurn 44: at y=3, choose U, y_{45}=4\n\nTurn 45: at y=4, choose U, y_{46}=5\n\nAnd so on, to y=9.\n\nBut at turn 44 and 45, I am at y=3 and y=4, which are safe, since no occupation except at T=42.\n\nAt turn 44, T=44, freeways: for example, freeway 3 at T=44, Δt=5, span [-47+12*5, -36+12*5] = [-47+60, -36+60] = [13,24], no 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nThen I reach y=9 in how many turns from turn 42.\n\nFrom y=1 at turn 42, to y=9, need 8 up moves.\n\ny_{42}=1\n\nAfter first U: y_{43}=2\n\nU: y_{44}=3\n\nU: y_{45}=4\n\nU: y_{46}=5\n\nU: y_{47}=6\n\nU: y_{48}=7\n\nU: y_{49}=8\n\nU: y_{50}=9\n\nSo at turn 50, y=9.\n\nBut turn 50 is when I reach y=9.\n\nNow, at turn 48, y=7; turn 49, y=8; but freeways 7 and 8 are occupied at T=44 and 45, which is earlier, but at T=48 and 49, are they safe?\n\nFreeway 7 at T=48: Δt=48-39=9\n\nFirst car: span [-41 +6*9, -30+6*9] = [-41+54, -30+54] = [13,24], no 0\n\nSecond car: [7+6*9, 18+6*9] = [7+54,18+54]=[61,72], no 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly at T=49, similar.\n\nBut I need to check if there are other occupations, but freeway 1 at later time, but I am not on it.\n\nFreeway 1 occupied at T=52-55, but at that time I am higher.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nBut in this path, I went down to y=1 at turn 42, then up.\n\nBut total turns from start: from turn 39 to turn 50, that's 12 turns? Let's see.\n\nStart turn 39: position at turn 39.\n\nAfter H turns, I reach at turn t_1 + H -1? The sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so at turn t_1 + H -1 I reach.\n\nDefine.\n\nI start at turn t_1=39, position (0,y_{t_1}) = (0,3)\n\nI apply actions a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, and at turn t_1 + H -1, I reach (0,9)\n\nIn terms of turns, after H actions, I am at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, after first action at t_1, I am at turn t_1+1, position y_{t_1+1}\n\nAfter k actions, I am at turn t_1 + k.\n\nSet t = turn index.\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t, choose a_t, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nI start at t=39, y=3.\n\nAfter choosing a_{39}, at t=40, y_{40}, and so on.\n\nI reach y_t =9 at some turn t.\n\nThen H is the number of actions from t=39 to t-1? Let's see.\n\nSuppose I reach at turn T, so y_T=9.\n\nThen the actions were applied at turns 39,40,41,...,T-1.\n\nBecause at turn 39, action a_{39} sets y_{40}\n\nAt turn 40, a_{40} sets y_{41}\n\n...\n\nAt turn T-1, a_{T-1} sets y_T=9\n\nSo the actions are from turn 39 to turn T-1, total H = T - 39 actions.\n\nThen at turn T, I am at y_T=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions for turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1, that is, from 39 to 39+H-1, and at turn (39+H-1) +1 = 39+H, I am at y_{39+H}=9? Messy.\n\nStandard: the actions are a_{t} for t = t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nThen after these actions, at turn t_1 + H, I am at position.\n\nBut in the position, at turn t_1, I start, after action a_{t_1}, I move to turn t_1+1 position.\n\nSo at turn t_1 + H, I am at y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nAnd I need y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn the answer, it should be the actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, if I go directly in 6 steps: actions at t=39 to 44, then at t=45, y=9.\n\ny_{39}=3\n\na_{39}=U, y_{40}=4\n\na_{40}=U, y_{41}=5\n\na_{41}=U, y_{42}=6\n\nBut at t=42, y=6 occupied, not possible.\n\nIn our case, we have a detour.\n\nIn the path I thought: to avoid, I go down.\n\nFor example, take option 4: a_{39}=S, a_{40}=D, a_{41}=D → y_{40}=3 (since S), y_{41}=2 (D), y_{42}=1 (D)\n\nThen from there, a_{42}=U, y_{43}=2\n\na_{43}=U, y_{44}=3\n\na_{44}=U, y_{45}=4\n\na_{45}=U, y_{46}=5\n\na_{46}=U, y_{47}=6\n\na_{47}=U, y_{48}=7\n\na_{48}=U, y_{49}=8\n\na_{49}=U, y_{50}=9\n\nSo at turn 50, y=9.\n\nActions from t=39 to 49, that's 11 actions? t=39,40,41,...,49, that's 11 turns? 39 to 49 inclusive is 11 actions.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=39 to t=49, that's 11 actions, H=11.\n\nThen at turn t_1 + H = 39+11=50, y=9.\n\nt_1 + H = 39 + 11 =50.\n\nBut we can do better?\n\nEarlier I assumed y_{42}=1.\n\nBut I could be at y=0.\n\nIf at turn 42, y=0.\n\nThen a_{42}=U, y_{43}=1\n\nThen a_{43}=U, y_{44}=2\n\na_{44}=U, y_{45}=3\n\netc., similar, but now from y=0, it takes one more step to reach y=9.\n\nFor example, if y_{42}=0:\n\na_{42}=U, y_{43}=1\n\na_{43}=U, y_{44}=2\n\na_{44}=U, y_{45}=3\n\na_{45}=U, y_{46}=4\n\na_{46}=U, y_{47}=5\n\na_{47}=U, y_{48}=6\n\na_{48}=U, y_{49}=7\n\na_{49}=U, y_{50}=8\n\na_{50}=U, y_{51}=9\n\nSo reach at turn 51, with actions from 39 to 50, H=12, worse.\n\nSo better to be at y=1 at turn 42.\n\nIn the options, we have ways to be at y=1 at turn 42.\n\nFor example, option 2: a_{39}=D, a_{40}=D, a_{41}=S → y_{40}=2, y_{41}=1, y_{42}=1\n\nOr option 3: a_{39}=D, a_{40}=S, a_{41}=D → y_{40}=2, y_{41}=2, y_{42}=1\n\nOr option 4: a_{39}=S, a_{40}=D, a_{41}=D → y_{40}=3, y_{41}=2, y_{42}=1\n\nAll have y_{42}=1.\n\nNow, from there, I go up directly to y=9 in 8 moves, as above, reach turn 50.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nEarlier I thought that since at turn 44 and 45 I am low, no issue, but perhaps I can go faster by not going down so much.\n\nAnother idea: since freeways 7 and 8 are occupied only at 44 and 45, and I am starting from low, but if I can be higher earlier, I might reach faster.\n\nFor example, from turn 42, if I were at higher y, but at turn 42 I am at y=1, and I can only reach y=3 by turn 44, as above.\n\nBut y=3 is fine.\n\nPerhaps I don't need to go all the way to y=1; maybe I can be at y=7 or 8 before or after the danger times.\n\nBut at turn 42, I cannot be higher than y=6? But y=6 is occupied at T=42, so I have to be low.\n\nUnless I am at y=7 or 8 at turn 42, but earlier we saw I cannot, since from y=3 in 3 moves, max y=6.\n\nAnd y=6 occupied at T=42.\n\ny=7 and 8 are safe at T=42, but not reachable.\n\nSo no, I have to be at y<=1 at turn 42.\n\nThen from there, min to y=9 is 8 up moves, so from turn 42 to turn 50, 8 actions, y from 1 to 9.\n\nActions at t=42 to 49, reach at t=50.\n\nNow, the actions before: from t=39 to 41, I have actions to get to y_{42}=1, which take 3 actions.\n\nSo total actions: t=39 to 49, 11 actions.\n\nBut let's list the sequence.\n\nFor example, take option 4: a_{39}=S (stay at y=3? a_{39}=S, then y_{40}=y_{39}=3, since S)\n\nIn option 4: a_{39}=S, a_{40}=D, a_{41}=D → y_{40}=3, y_{41}=2, y_{42}=1\n\nThen a_{42}=U, y_{43}=2\n\na_{43}=U, y_{44}=3\n\na_{44}=U, y_{45}=4\n\na_{45}=U, y_{46}=5\n\na_{46}=U, y_{47}=6\n\na_{47}=U, y_{48}=7\n\na_{48}=U, y_{49}=8\n\na_{49}=U, y_{50}=9\n\nNow, at turn 48, y=7; turn 49, y=8.\n\nBut freeway 7 and 8 are safe at these times, as earlier.\n\nNow, total actions from t=39 to t=49, that's t=39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49 — 11 actions.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut can I reduce?\n\nNotice that at turn 44 and 45, since I am at y=3 and y=4, low, but if I could be higher, I might save time.\n\nBut I cannot, because I start from low at turn 42.\n\nPerhaps I don't need to go down to y=1; if I can be at y=0 or 1, but y=0 might be slower.\n\nAnother thought: at turn 42, I need to be at y=0 or 1, but y=0 is not necessary, y=1 is fine.\n\nIn the sequence, when I go up from y=1, at turn 43, y=2; turn 44, y=3; etc.\n\nBut at turn 48, y=7; turn 49, y=8; then turn 50, y=9.\n\nNow, is there a way to reach y=9 earlier?\n\nFor example, if I can be at higher y at turn 42, but I cannot.\n\nPerhaps I can go up faster after turn 42.\n\nBut each step up takes one turn.\n\nMinimal from y=1 to y=9 is 8 turns.\n\nUnless I can skip some, but no.\n\nBut I have to pass through each y, but I can stay, but staying doesn't help.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=7 or 8 before turn 44 or after turn 45.\n\nFor example, if I can reach y=8 by turn 43 or something, but from y=1 at turn 42, to y=8 at turn 43? Impossible, max y=2 at turn 43.\n\ny_{43} = y_{42} + Δy_{42} <= 1+1=2\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps I don't need to avoid y=7 and 8 at all, only at specific times.\n\nBut in this case, since I am low at turn 44 and 45, no issue.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can go directly without the detour.\n\nEarlier I thought not, but let's see the occupation again.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 41, if I could be at y=7 or something, but impossible from turn 39.\n\nMax at turn 41: from y=3 at t=39, with two up: y_{40}=4, y_{41}=5, then at t=41 y=5, which is safe, but then I cannot set y_{42} safely.\n\nIf I am at y=6 at turn 41, but y_{41}=6: how? From y=3, in two steps: to y=4 at t=40, then to y=5 at t=41, cannot reach y=6 in two steps from y=3.\n\ny_{41} = y_{39} + Δy_{39} + Δy_{40} <= 3+1+1=5, so y=5 at turn 41.\n\nThen y_{42} <=6, but y=6 occupied.\n\nIf I could be at y=7 at turn 41, impossible.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, the detour is necessary.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have 11 actions.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach y=9 faster by choosing a different path after turn 42.\n\nFor example, from y=1 at turn 42, I go up, but perhaps at some point I can skip or something, but no.\n\nNotice that freeway 7 and 8 are occupied only at 44 and 45, but since I am below, no problem.\n\nBut if I were higher, I might reach earlier, but I cannot.\n\nAnother thought: at turn 44 and 45, I need to not be on y=7 or 8, but I can be on other y, or on y=9.\n\nBut y=9 is safe.\n\nIn my current path, I reach y=9 at turn 50.\n\nBut perhaps I can reach earlier if I start going up immediately after the danger, but I have to go through the freeways.\n\nFor example, suppose at turn 45, I am at y=6, then I can go to y=7,8,9 in three turns, but I need to be safe at turn 45.\n\nAt turn 45, if I am on y=6, it is safe, since no occupation.\n\nBut to be at y=6 at turn 45, from turn 42 y=1, I need to go up 5 steps in 3 turns? From turn 42 to 45.\n\nt=42,43,44 actions set y_{43},y_{44},y_{45}\n\ny_{42}=1\n\ny_{45} = y_{42} + Δy_{42} + Δy_{43} + Δy_{44}\n\nWith three actions, I can gain up to 3, so y_{45} <= 1+3=4, cannot reach y=6.\n\nSo I cannot be at high y at turn 45.\n\nThus, the earliest I can reach y=9 is from y=1 in 8 up moves, turn 50.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nIn the sequence I have:\n\nActions:\n\nt=39: S (for option 4)\n\nt=40: D\n\nt=41: D\n\nt=42: U\n\nt=43: U\n\nt=44: U\n\nt=45: U\n\nt=46: U\n\nt=47: U\n\nt=48: U\n\nt=49: U\n\nThen at t=50, y=9.\n\nBut at t=48, y=7; t=49, y=8; both safe.\n\nTotal actions 11.\n\nBut I can choose a shorter sequence to y=1 at turn 42.\n\nFor example, option 2: a_{39}=D, a_{40}=D, a_{41}=S → y_{40}=2, y_{41}=1, y_{42}=1\n\nThen same as above: a_{42} to a_{49} all U, but need to go to y=9.\n\na_{42}=U, y_{43}=2\n\n...\n\na_{49}=U, y_{50}=9, same.\n\nWith option 2, actions: t=39:D, t=40:D, t=41:S, then t=42:U to t=49:U, 9 actions from t=42 to 49? t=42 to 49 is 8 actions, plus t=39,40,41, total 11 same.\n\nt=39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49 — 11 actions.\n\nPerhaps I can start going up earlier.\n\nAnother idea: after turn 42, when I go up, at some point I can reach y=9 faster if I go directly, but no.\n\nBut notice that at turn 44 and 45, since I am at y=3 and 4, but if I could be at y=9 by turn 45, impossible.\n\nMinimal turns: from turn 39, if no cars, min 6 turns to y=9: actions t=39 to 44 U, y at t=45=9.\n\nBut with cars, I have to take detour, adding 5 turns? From 6 to 11, yes.\n\nBut let's see if I can have a sequence with less than 11.\n\nPerhaps I don't need to go all the way to y=1; if I can be at y=7 or 8 at turn 43 or something, but impossible.\n\nOr, another thought: I could go down to y=0 at turn 42, but that might be slower.\n\nOr, I could go up to y=6 before turn 42, but y=6 at turn 42 is occupied, so I cannot be there at turn 42.\n\nBut at turn 41, I could be at y=6? But at turn 41, from start, max y=5, as above.\n\ny_{41} <=5.\n\nAt turn 41, y=5, which is safe, but then I cannot avoid turn 42.\n\nUnless I move to y=7 or 8 at turn 41, but impossible.\n\nSo I think 11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's check if I can be at y=9 by turn 49 or something.\n\nIn the sequence, I reach at turn 50.\n\nPerhaps with different actions.\n\nAnother idea: since freeways 7 and 8 are occupied at 44 and 45, I can be on them before or after.\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=7 at turn 43, then at turn 43 it is safe, and at turn 44 I move away.\n\nBut to be on y=7 at turn 43, from turn 39 y=3, with actions at t=39,40,41,42 to set y_{40},41,42,43.\n\ny_{43} = y_{39} + Δy_{39} + Δy_{40} + Δy_{41} + Δy_{42} <= 3+4=7, but need to be exactly 7.\n\nBut at turn 42, I need to be safe, so y_{42} must be 0 or 1, as before.\n\nIf y_{42}=1, then y_{43} <=1+1=2, cannot be 7.\n\nIf I don't go down, but I have to at turn 42.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nThus, no faster way.\n\nSo minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I need to output the actions.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be for each turn.\n\nAlso, I need to specify the actions from t_1 onwards.\n\nt_1=39.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I can choose any of the options to reach y=1 at turn 42.\n\nFor example, let's take option 2: a_{39}=D, a_{40}=D, a_{41}=S\n\nThen a_{42}=U, a_{43}=U, a_{44}=U, a_{45}=U, a_{46}=U, a_{47}=U, a_{48}=U, a_{49}=U\n\nBut a_{49}=U sets y_{50}=9, so actions up to t=49.\n\nNow, write the sequence:\n\nTurn 39: D\n\nTurn 40: D\n\nTurn 41: S\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: U\n\nTurn 45: U\n\nTurn 46: U\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nThen at turn 50, y=9.\n\nBut is there a way with 10 actions? I don't think so.\n\nPerhaps I can go up faster after, but no.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 48 and 49, I am on y=7 and 8, but as computed, safe.\n\nBut in freeway 6, there is a second car, but it was not covering 0, so fine.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 at turn 49.\n\nFor example, if I am at y=8 at turn 48, then a_{48}=U, y_{49}=9.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at turn 48, from y=1 at turn 42, I need 7 up moves: y_{43}=2,44=3,45=4,46=5,47=6,48=7, then a_{48}=U to y_{49}=8, not 9.\n\ny_{42}=1\n\na_{42}=U, y_{43}=2\n\na_{43}=U, y_{44}=3\n\na_{44}=U, y_{45}=4\n\na_{45}=U, y_{46}=5\n\na_{46}=U, y_{47}=6\n\na_{47}=U, y_{48}=7\n\na_{48}=U, y_{49}=8\n\na_{49}=U, y_{50}=9\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn 49, I need y_{49}=9, so at turn 48, y_{48}=8 or 9, but if y_{48}=8, a_{48}=U to y_{49}=9.\n\nBut y_{48}=8, from y=1 at turn 42, in 6 moves: y_{43} to y_{48}, that's 6 positions, but from y_{42}=1 to y_{48}, with actions at t=42 to 47, 6 actions, y_{48} = y_{42} + sum_{t=42}^{47} Δy_t <=1+6=7, so y_{48}<=7, cannot be 8.\n\nThus, y_{48}=7 at best, then a_{47}? At turn 47, if y_{47}=7, then a_{47}=U, y_{48}=8; then a_{48}=U, y_{49}=9.\n\nBut y_{47}=7: from y=1 at turn 42, with actions t=42 to 46 (5 actions), y_{47} <=1+5=6, cannot be 7.\n\ny_{42}=1\n\nAfter k actions, y_{42 + k} <= 1 + k\n\nSet y_{42 + k} = 1 + k if all U.\n\nFor y_{47} at turn 47: turn 47 = 42 + 5, so y_{47} <= 1+5=6\n\nSimilarly, y_{48} <=7, y_{49}<=8, y_{50}<=9.\n\nSo to have y_{49}=9, need y_{49} <=8? y_{49} = y_{48} + Δy_{48} <= (1 + 6) +1 =8? y_{48} <=7, then y_{49} <=8, so to have y_{49}=9, impossible? y_{49} <=8, so I can only reach y=8 at turn 49 at best, then y_{50}=9.\n\nThus, minimal to reach y=9 is turn 50, with actions up to turn 49.\n\nH=11 actions.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I need to output from turn 39.\n\nIn the actions, I have to avoid collision at all turns.\n\nIn the sequence above, let's verify the positions.\n\nTurn 39: y=3, action D → y_{40}=2\n\nTurn 40: y=2, action D → y_{41}=1\n\nTurn 41: y=1, action S → y_{42}=1 (since S)\n\nTurn 42: y=1, action U → y_{43}=2\n\nTurn 43: y=2, action U → y_{44}=3\n\nTurn 44: y=3, action U → y_{45}=4\n\nTurn 45: y=4, action U → y_{46}=5\n\nTurn 46: y=5, action U → y_{47}=6\n\nTurn 47: y=6, action U → y_{48}=7\n\nTurn 48: y=7, action U → y_{49}=8\n\nTurn 49: y=8, action U → y_{50}=9\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nTurn 39: y=3, safe\n\nTurn 40: y=2, freeway 2, at T=40, Δt=1, span [-35,-24], no 0, safe\n\nTurn 41: y=1, freeway 1, at T=41, Δt=2, span [-44,-33], no 0, safe\n\nTurn 42: y=1, freeway 1, at T=42, Δt=3, span [-41,-30], no 0, safe\n\nTurn 43: y=2, freeway 2, at T=43, Δt=4, span [-47+48, -36+48]= [1,12]? -47+12*4= -47+48=1, -36+48=12, so [1,12], 0 not in, since min 1>0, safe\n\nTurn 44: y=3, freeway 3, at T=44, Δt=5, span [-47+60, -36+60]=[13,24], no 0, safe\n\nTurn 45: y=4, freeway 4, at T=45, Δt=6, span [-47+72, -36+72]=[25,36], no 0, safe\n\nTurn 46: y=5, freeway 5, at T=46, Δt=7, span [-47+84, -36+84]=[37,48], no 0, safe\n\nTurn 47: y=6, freeway 6, at T=47, Δt=8, first car span [-47+96, -36+96]=[49,60], no 0; second car [25+96,36+96]=[121,132], no 0; safe\n\nTurn 48: y=7, freeway 7, at T=48, Δt=9, first car [-41+54, -30+54]=[13,24], no 0; second car [7+54,18+54]=[61,72], no 0; safe\n\nTurn 49: y=8, freeway 8, at T=49, Δt=10, first car [-41+60, -30+60]=[19,30], no 0; second car [7+60,18+60]=[67,78], no 0; safe\n\nThen turn 50: y=9, no freeway, safe, reached.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output the actions from turn 39 to 49.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 41 action is S, which is fine.\n\nTo write in the box.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nH=11.\n\nIn the sequence, I used option 2, but I could use other options.\n\nFor example, with option 4: a_{39}=S, a_{40}=D, a_{41}=D, then same up.\n\na_{39}=S: at turn 39, y=3, S, y_{40}=3\n\nThen a_{40}=D, y_{41}=2\n\na_{41}=D, y_{42}=1\n\nThen same as before.\n\nAlso fine.\n\nBut in this case, at turn 40, y=3, which is safe, as before.\n\nNo issue.\n\nNow, for the output.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn 39: D\n\nTurn 40: D\n\nTurn 41: S\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: U\n\nTurn 45: U\n\nTurn 46: U\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nIn the answer format, it should be like that.\n\nBut let's confirm if all actions are necessary; for example, at turn 41, I used S, but I could use D to go to y=0, but then slower, not better.\n\nSimilarly, in the up part, I must go up each time to minimize.\n\nSo this should be minimal.\n\nPerhaps I can combine the last actions, but no.\n\nSo H=11.\n\nNow, for the box.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 39\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by moving down to \\(y = 1\\) by turn 42 to avoid the collision at turn 42 on freeways \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 6\\), and then moving up directly to \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThe actions are as follows:\n\n- At turn 39, move down (D) to reach \\(y = 2\\) at turn 40.\n- At turn 40, move down (D) to reach \\(y = 1\\) at turn 41.\n- At turn 41, stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 1\\) at turn 42.\n- From turn 42 to turn 49, move up (U) each turn to increase \\(y\\) by 1 per turn, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 50.\n\nThis sequence ensures no collision:\n- At turn 42, \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1) is safe as the car span is \\([-41, -30]\\), excluding 0.\n- Freeways 7 and 8 are occupied at turns 44 and 45, but at those turns, the player is at \\(y = 3\\) and \\(y = 4\\), which are safe.\n- All other turns are safe as the player is not on an occupied freeway.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 39: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 40: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 41: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 42: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 43: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 44: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 45: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 46: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 47: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 48: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 49: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t1 = 42, and I start at y=0. I can move up, down, or stay, but since I need to get to y=9, I'll mostly be moving up.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movements. Each car has a head and tail, and it moves left or right at a constant speed. The collision happens only if at the turn when I'm on a freeway, the x=0 is within the car's span at that exact turn.\n\nAlso, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that freeway until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, I'm on y at turn T, and I arrive at y+1 at turn T+1. But the position update is y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, so at turn t, I'm at y_t, and after action a_t, I go to y_{t+1}.\n\nThe collision condition: at turn T, if I'm on freeway y_T, and for any car on that freeway, 0 is in Span(T), then collision.\n\nAnd Span(T) for a car: for left-moving, Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)], but the head and tail are given at t1, so I need to compute the position at time T.\n\nLet me denote t1 = 42 as the starting turn.\n\nFor each freeway, I have cars with their positions at t1=42.\n\nLet me list all cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head h=-48, tail τ=-59, direction right, speed s=3.\n\nDirection right means it's moving right, so as time increases, the position increases.\n\nIn the span update:\n\nRight-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nBecause for right-moving, at t1, span is [τ, h] with τ < h I assume? Let's see.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nh = -48, τ = -59. But -48 > -59, so if it's right-moving, and head is at -48, tail at -59, that means the car is from left to right? Let's interpret.\n\nTypically, for a right-moving car, the head is the front, so if it's moving right, head has higher x if x increases right.\n\nBut here, at t1, head h=-48, tail τ=-59, and since -48 > -59, and direction right, so it's moving to the right, so at time T, the span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-59 + 3(T-42), -48 + 3(T-42)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] if head is left or something, but here all cars seem to be right-moving except I need to check.\n\nIn this problem, all cars given are right-moving, I think.\n\nFreeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3) so right-moving.\n\nFreeway 2: (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nh=48, τ=37? 48>37, so head at 48, tail at 37, moving right, so span at T: [37 + 12(T-42), 48 + 12(T-42)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? (48,37,right,12)\n\nFreeway 4: same (48,37,right,12)\n\nFreeway 5: same (48,37,right,12)\n\nFreeway 6: two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst car: h=48, τ=37, right, s=12\n\nSecond car: h=0, τ=-11, right, s=12? h=0, τ=-11, so tail at -11, head at 0, moving right.\n\nAt T, span: [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-11 + 12(T-42), 0 + 12(T-42)] for the second car.\n\nSimilarly, first car: [37 + 12(T-42), 48 + 12(T-42)]\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nFirst: h=-48, τ=-59, right, s=6, so at T: [-59 + 6(T-42), -48 + 6(T-42)]\n\nSecond: h=0, τ=-11, right, s=6, at T: [-11 + 6(T-42), 0 + 6(T-42)]\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 to y=9, starting at turn t=42, position (0,0).\n\nAt turn t=42, I am at (0,0), which is not on any freeway since freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 is safe, I assume no cars there or it's not a freeway.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 is the goal, probably safe.\n\nNow, I need to reach (0,9), so y=9.\n\nActions: U (up), D (down), S (stay). But since I start at y=0 and need to go to y=9, I should mostly go up, but I have to avoid collisions when on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H: since I need to go up 9 units, the minimum H would be 9 if I can go up every turn without collision. But I might need to stay or even go down to avoid cars, but that would increase H, so I should try to go up as much as possible.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from turn t1 to t1+H-1, I take H actions, and after H actions, I am at y=9.\n\nStart at t=42, y=42} =0.\n\nAfter action a_{42}, I go to y_{43}, and so on, until at some turn T, y_T =9.\n\nAnd T = 42 + H -1 or something? Let's see.\n\nI take actions from t=42 to t=42 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo at time t (turn), I take action a_t.\n\nAfter a_t, at time t+1, I am at y_{t+1}.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t1 to t1 + H -1, so actions at turns 42, 43, ..., up to turn 42 + H -1.\n\nAfter the last action at turn 42 + H -1, I am at y_{42 + H} =9.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nSo after H actions, I am at y_{42 + H}.\n\nSet y_{42} =0.\n\nAfter a_{42}, y_{43} = y_{42} + Δy_{42}\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{42 + k}, y_{42 + k +1} = y_{42 + k} + Δy_{42 + k}\n\nAfter H actions (from k=0 to H-1), I am at y_{42 + H}.\n\nAnd I want y_{42 + H} =9.\n\nAlso, at each turn t from 42 to 42 + H -1, when I am at y_t, if y_t between 1 and 8, I must not collide with cars on that freeway at turn t.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position (0, y_t), so if 1 ≤ y_t ≤ 8, then I am on freeway y_t at turn t, and must check for cars on freeway y_t at turn t.\n\nNow, the collision is if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nSince all cars are on specific freeways, and I only care about the freeway I am on at turn t.\n\nAlso, when I move, if I change y, at turn t I am on y_t, and I move to y_{t+1}, but at turn t, I am still on y_t, so only check cars for y_t at turn t.\n\nAt turn t+1, I am on y_{t+1}, so check for that.\n\nNow, since I start at y=0 at t=42, and y=0 is not a freeway, no collision at t=42.\n\nSimilarly, when I reach y=9, if at turn T I am at y_T=9, and 9 is not a freeway (freeways 1-8), so no collision, I assume.\n\nThe goal is to be at (0,9), which is not on freeway, so safe.\n\nNow, I need to find a sequence of actions to reach y=9 as fast as possible.\n\nFirst, let's list the cars per freeway and when they block x=0.\n\nA car blocks freeway k at turn t if 0 is in the span of a car on freeway k at turn t.\n\nFor each freeway, I need to find the times when it is blocked, i.e., when some car has 0 in its span.\n\nThen, when I am on that freeway at turn t, it must not be blocked.\n\nSince I move one y per turn usually, I can think about for each y from 1 to 8, when I can be there safely.\n\nBut since I can stay or move multiple times, I need to sequence the actions.\n\nFirst, let's compute for each freeway the set of turns where it is blocked.\n\nt1 = 42.\n\nLet τ = T - t1 = T - 42, the number of turns after t1.\n\nThen for a car, at time T, the span depends on τ.\n\nFor freeway 1: only one car: h=-48, τ=-59, d=right, s=3\n\nSpan at T: [ -59 + 3τ , -48 + 3τ ] where τ = T-42\n\n0 in span if -59 + 3τ ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 3τ\n\nSo -59 + 3τ ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -48 + 3τ\n\nFirst inequality: -59 + 3τ ≤ 0 => 3τ ≤ 59 => τ ≤ 59/3 = 19.666, so τ <= 19 since τ integer? Turns are discrete, I assume.\n\nτ = T - 42, T integer, so τ integer.\n\nSimilarly, all positions, I think we can assume integers, since speeds are integers, positions given integers.\n\nSo τ integer.\n\n-59 + 3τ ≤ 0 => 3τ ≤ 59 => τ ≤ 19 since 3*19=57<59, 3*20=60>59, so τ ≤ 19? Let's calculate.\n\n-59 + 3τ ≤ 0 => 3τ ≤ 59 => τ ≤ 59/3 = 19 + 2/3, so since τ integer, τ <= 19? 3τ <=59, τ<=19.666, so τ<=19.\n\n3*19=57, -59+57= -2 <=0 true.\n\n3*20=60, -59+60=1>0, so -59+3τ <=0 for τ<=19? τ=19: -59+57= -2 <=0, τ=20: -59+60=1>0, so inequality -59+3τ <=0 holds for τ<=19.\n\nBut we need -59+3τ <=0 and 0 <= -48+3τ\n\nFirst: -59+3τ <=0 => τ <= floor(59/3) =19 since 59/3=19.666, floor 19.\n\n3τ <=59, τ <= 19 because 3*19=57<=59, 3*20=60>59.\n\n-59 + 3τ <=0 for τ <=19.\n\nFor τ=19: -59+57= -2 <=0 true\n\nτ=20: -59+60=1>0 false\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 <= -48 + 3τ => 48 <= 3τ => τ >= 16 since 3*16=48.\n\n0 <= -48 + 3τ => 48 <= 3τ => τ >= ceil(48/3) =16.\n\nτ >=16.\n\nSo both: τ >=16 and τ <=19.\n\nSo for τ=16,17,18,19.\n\nNow τ = T-42, so T=42+16=58 to 42+19=61.\n\nT from 58 to 61 inclusive.\n\nτ=16: T=42+16=58\n\nτ=17: T=59\n\nτ=18: T=60\n\nτ=19: T=61\n\nSo freeway 1 is blocked at turns 58,59,60,61.\n\nNow, freeway 2: one car (48,37,right,12)\n\nh=48, τ=37? In the table, it says (head, tail, dir, speed), so for this car, head=48, tail=37, dir=right, s=12.\n\nAssuming tail < head since moving right.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + sτ, h + sτ] where sτ is s*(T-42), τ here is time offset, confusing.\n\nUse delta.\n\nSet δ = T - 42.\n\nSpan: [37 + 12δ, 48 + 12δ]\n\n0 in span if 37 + 12δ <= 0 <= 48 + 12δ\n\nBut 37 + 12δ is always positive for δ >=0, since at δ=0, 37>0, so 37+12δ >=37>0, so 0 < 37+12δ, so 0 <= 48+12δ always true since 48+12δ>0, but 37+12δ <=0 is impossible because min at δ=0 is 37>0.\n\nSo 0 is never <= 37+12δ since 37+12δ >=37>0, so 0 not in [37+12δ, 48+12δ] for any δ.\n\nThus, freeway 2 is never blocked.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same car (48,37,right,12), same as freeway 2, never blocked.\n\nFreeway 4: same, never blocked.\n\nFreeway 5: same, never blocked.\n\nFreeway 6: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12), same as above, never blocks x=0.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12) so head=0, tail=-11, dir=right, s=12.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + sδ, h + sδ] = [-11 + 12δ, 0 + 12δ] where δ=T-42\n\n0 in span if -11 + 12δ <= 0 <= 12δ\n\nFirst: -11 + 12δ <= 0 => 12δ <=11 => δ <= 11/12 <1, since δ integer >=0, δ=0: -11+0=-11<=0 true, δ=1: -11+12=1>0 false, so only δ=0.\n\nSecond: 0 <= 12δ, always true for δ>=0.\n\nSo at δ=0, T=42, span [-11,0], so 0 is included? -11 <=0 <=0, yes, 0 is in [-11,0].\n\nAt δ=0, T=42.\n\nFor δ=0, span = [-11 +0, 0+0] = [-11,0], and 0 is in this interval since -11 <=0 <=0.\n\nYes.\n\nFor δ=1, span [-11+12, 0+12] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=42, freeway 6 is blocked by the second car.\n\nBut at T=42, I am at y=0, not on freeway 6, so it doesn't affect me directly, but if I am on freeway 6 at T=42, I would collide, but I am not.\n\nNow, freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,6) similar to freeway 1 but different speed.\n\nh=-48, τ=-59, dir=right, s=6\n\nSpan at T: [ -59 + 6δ, -48 + 6δ ] with δ=T-42\n\n0 in span if -59 + 6δ <= 0 <= -48 + 6δ\n\nFirst: -59 + 6δ <= 0 => 6δ <=59 => δ <= 59/6 = 9.833, so δ <=9\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 + 6δ => 48 <= 6δ => δ >= 8\n\nSo δ >=8 and δ <=9\n\nδ=8: T=42+8=50\n\nδ=9: T=42+9=51\n\nNow, second car on freeway 7: (0,-11,right,6) head=0, tail=-11, s=6\n\nSpan: [-11 + 6δ, 0 + 6δ]\n\n0 in span if -11 + 6δ <= 0 <= 6δ\n\nFirst: -11 + 6δ <=0 => 6δ <=11 => δ <= 11/6 ≈1.833, so δ<=1\n\nSecond: 0 <= 6δ, true for δ>=1? 0 <= 6δ always for δ>=0 except δ=0.\n\nAt δ=0: 0 <=0 true? 0 <= 6*0=0, yes.\n\nBut -11 +6δ <=0: at δ=0, -11<=0 true; δ=1, -11+6=-5<=0 true; δ=2, -11+12=1>0 false.\n\nAnd 0 <= 6δ: at δ=0, 0<=0 true; δ=1,0<=6 true, etc.\n\nSo for δ=0: -11+0=-11<=0 and 0<=0, true\n\nδ=1: -11+6=-5<=0 and 0<=6, true\n\nδ=2: -11+12=1>0, not <=0, so false.\n\nSo for second car, 0 in span at δ=0 and δ=1, i.e., T=42 and T=43.\n\nNow for freeway 7, both cars: first car blocks at T=50,51; second car blocks at T=42,43.\n\nSo freeway 7 blocked at T=42,43 (from second car), and T=50,51 (from first car).\n\nNow freeway 8: same as freeway 7, since cars are identical: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nSo same blocking times: T=42,43 from second car, T=50,51 from first car.\n\nNow freeway 6: we have blocking only at T=42 from the second car.\n\nBut at T=42, I am not on it, so for me, freeway 6 is only blocked at T=42, but since I might be there later, it's not blocked at other times.\n\nSimilarly, freeways 2,3,4,5 never blocked.\n\nFreeway 1 blocked at T=58,59,60,61.\n\nNow, I need to go through y=1 to 8, each for at least one turn, but I can stay multiple turns or skip by going up fast.\n\nSince I can only change y by at most 1 per turn, I must visit each y from 0 to 9, but y=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\nThe path must include y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 each at some point.\n\nBut I can be on a freeway multiple times if I stay or go down, but to minimize turns, I should avoid staying or going down, so probably go up as fast as possible, only delay if necessary to avoid blocked times.\n\nThe minimum H is at least 9, since I need to increase y by 9.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway the safe times, i.e., when not blocked.\n\nFreeway 1: blocked T=58,59,60,61, so safe for all T except 58-61.\n\nFreeway 2: always safe.\n\nFreeway 3: always safe.\n\nFreeway 4: always safe.\n\nFreeway 5: always safe.\n\nFreeway 6: blocked only at T=42, so safe for all T except 42.\n\nSince T=42 is past, and I start at T=42, but at T=42 I am at y=0, not on freeway 6, so for future, freeway 6 is safe for T>42.\n\nT=42 is blocked, but for T=43 onwards, it should be safe? Let's see.\n\nAt T=42, blocked, but for T=43, δ=1, span for second car: [-11+12, 0+12] = [1,12], 0 not in, and first car not blocking, so freeway 6 safe for T>=43 and all other times except T=42.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: blocked T=42,43,50,51.\n\nSo safe for T not in {42,43,50,51}\n\nBut T=42 and 43 are past or current? T=42 is current turn, I am at y=0, so not on freeway 7.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 same: blocked T=42,43,50,51, safe otherwise.\n\nNow, I start at T=42, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0,+1.\n\nI need net +9.\n\nTo minimize turns, I should go up as much as possible, only use stay or down to avoid being on a freeway when it is blocked.\n\nNow, let's consider the critical freeways: 1,6,7,8 have some blocked times.\n\nFreeway 6 is only blocked at T=42, which is not an issue since I can be there later.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 blocked at T=50,51 and also 42,43 but 42,43 are early.\n\nFreeway 1 blocked late at 58-61.\n\nSince I start at y=0, I need to go to y=1, then y=2, etc.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T.\n\nI must be safe at each T when 1<=y_T<=8.\n\nNow, the blocked times are concentrated: for y=7 and 8, blocked at T=50,51; for y=1, blocked at T=58-61.\n\nOther y are always safe or have no blocking except past.\n\ny=2,3,4,5 always safe.\n\ny=6 safe except T=42, but T=42 is gone, so always safe for T>=43.\n\ny=7 and y=8 have blocking at T=50,51.\n\ny=1 has blocking at T=58-61.\n\nNow, since y=2,3,4,5 are always safe, I can pass through them quickly.\n\ny=6 is always safe now.\n\ny=7 and y=8 have a danger at T=50,51.\n\ny=1 has danger at T=58-61.\n\nTo minimize H, I should go up fast to y=9, but I might need to time when I am on y=7 and y=8 to avoid T=50,51, and similarly for y=1, but y=1 is the first one.\n\nSince I start from y=0, I need to go to y=1 first.\n\nI can consider the earliest time I can be on each y.\n\nBut since some are safe always, I can go up continuously except where blocked.\n\nLet me list the actions starting from T=42.\n\nAt T=42, y=0, safe.\n\nI need to choose a_{42}: U, D, or S.\n\nSince I need to go up, probably U or S, but S keeps me at y=0, which might waste time, so likely U to go to y=1.\n\nBut at T=42, if I go to y=1, at T=43 I am at y=1.\n\nNow, freeway y=1: when is it blocked? Freeway 1 blocked at T=58,59,60,61, so at T=43, it is safe, since 43 not in 58-61.\n\nSimilarly, for other y.\n\nBut y=7 and y=8 are blocked at T=50,51, so I should not be on y=7 or y=8 at T=50 or 51.\n\nSimilarly, for y=1, not at T=58-61.\n\nSince T=50,51 are around turn 50, and I start at 42, I can reach y=7 or 8 around turn 42 +7 =49 or so, if I go up every turn.\n\nSimilarly, T=58-61 is later.\n\nFirst, let's see if I can go up directly without stopping.\n\nSuppose I go up every turn from T=42 onwards.\n\nThen:\n\nT=42: y=0, take action U, go to y=1 at T=43.\n\nT=43: y=1, must be safe. Freeway 1 safe at T=43, since not 58-61. So take U, go to y=2 at T=44.\n\nT=44: y=2, freeway 2 always safe, take U, to y=3 at T=45.\n\nT=45: y=3, safe, U to y=4 at T=46.\n\nT=46: y=4, safe, U to y=5 at T=47.\n\nT=47: y=5, safe, U to y=6 at T=48.\n\nT=48: y=6, freeway 6 safe (since T=48>42), take U to y=7 at T=49.\n\nT=49: y=7, freeway 7. Now, is it safe? Freeway 7 blocked at T=50,51, not at T=49. T=49 is safe? Blocked at 42,43,50,51. T=49 not in, so safe. Take U to y=8 at T=50.\n\nT=50: y=8, freeway 8 at turn T=50. But freeway 8 blocked at T=50! Because T=50 is one of the blocked times.\n\nFor freeway 8, blocked at T=50,51.\n\nSo at T=50, if I am on y=8, collision.\n\nIn this sequence, at T=50, y=8, and freeway 8 blocked, so collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nSimilarly, if I had stayed or something.\n\nAt T=49, y=7, I could stay or go down, but that wastes time.\n\nSince freeway 7 and 8 blocked only at T=50 and 51, I should not be on them at those turns.\n\nSo, I need to be on y=7 before T=50 or after T=51, similarly for y=8.\n\ny=7 and y=8 are adjacent, so I need to be on y=7 at some turn, then go to y=8 at next or later.\n\nSimilarly for leaving.\n\nLet me denote the turn when I arrive at y=k.\n\nI start at y=0 at T=42.\n\nAfter first action, at T=43, I am at y_{43}, which could be 1 or 0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTo reach y=9, I need to be at y=8 at some turn and go up.\n\nNow, for y=7: I must be on it at a turn not in {50,51}, so T<=49 or T>=52.\n\nSimilarly for y=8: T<=49 or T>=52.\n\nSince I go from y=7 to y=8, the turn when I am on y=7 and the turn when I am on y=8 should be consecutive or not, but if I go directly, they are consecutive turns.\n\nSuppose I go from y=7 to y=8 at turn T, meaning at turn T, I am at y=7, take U, go to y=8 at T+1.\n\nThen at turn T, I am on freeway 7, must be safe.\n\nAt turn T+1, I am on freeway 8, must be safe.\n\nSo both T and T+1 must not be in the blocked times for their freeways.\n\nBut since both freeways blocked at same times, T and T+1 both must avoid 50 and 51.\n\nSpecifically, for T (on y=7): T not in {50,51}, and for T+1 (on y=8): T+1 not in {50,51}.\n\nNow, if T=50, then on y=7 at T=50, blocked; if T=51, on y=7 at T=51 blocked.\n\nSimilarly, if T+1=50, on y=8 at T=50 blocked; T+1=51, on y=8 at T=51 blocked.\n\nSo to avoid, we need T not 50 or 51, and T+1 not 50 or 51.\n\nWhich means T cannot be 49,50,51.\n\nBecause:\n\n- If T=49, then at T=49 on y=7, safe (since not 50,51), but at T+1=50 on y=8, blocked.\n\n- If T=50, on y=7 blocked.\n\n- If T=51, on y=7 blocked.\n\n- If T=52, on y=7 at T=52, safe, and to y=8 at T=53, safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=48: on y=7 at T=48 safe, to y=8 at T=49 safe.\n\nNow, T=49: as above, to y=8 at T=50 blocked.\n\nSo possible T for leaving y=7: T<=48 or T>=52.\n\nThat is, I must leave y=7 to y=8 at or before T=48, or at or after T=52.\n\nIn terms of the turn when I take the action to go up from y=7.\n\nNow, similarly, for other parts.\n\nNow, back to the sequence.\n\nI start at T=42, y=0.\n\nI need to go up to y=1, etc.\n\ny=1 to y=6 are all safe except y=1 at late times, but since I am going up early, y=1 will be early.\n\nIn the direct up path, I was at y=7 at T=49.\n\nThen if I go up at T=49, to y=8 at T=50, which is blocked.\n\nSo I need to adjust.\n\nAt T=49, y=7, instead of going up, I could stay or go down.\n\nBut going down wastes time, staying also.\n\nSince I can be on y=7 earlier or later.\n\nIn the sequence above, I reached y=7 at T=49.\n\nBut I can reach earlier if I go up faster, but I am already going up every turn from start.\n\nT=42: y=0, after U, T=43: y=1\n\n...\n\nT=49: y=7, as above.\n\nI could delay going up at some point to arrive later.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=0 for one turn.\n\nAt T=42, instead of U, I take S, stay at y=0 at T=43? No.\n\nAt T=42, action a_{42}: if S, then y_{43} = y_{42} +0 =0, so at T=43, I am still at y=0.\n\nThen at T=43, I take U, go to y=1 at T=44.\n\nThen similarly, T=44: y=1, U to y=2 T=45, and so on, up to T=50: y=7? Let's compute.\n\nStart: T=42, y=0, take S: then y_{43} =0\n\nT=43: y=0, take U: y_{44} =1\n\nT=44: y=1, take U: y_{45}=2\n\nT=45: y=2, U: y_{46}=3\n\nT=46: y=3, U: y_{47}=4\n\nT=47: y=4, U: y_{48}=5\n\nT=48: y=5, U: y_{49}=6\n\nT=49: y=6, U: y_{50}=7\n\nT=50: y=7, now at T=50, y=7, freeway 7. Blocked? Freeway 7 blocked at T=50, yes, so collision.\n\nWorse.\n\nIf I take U at T=42, go to y=1 at T=43.\n\nThen at T=43, take S, stay at y=1, then y_{44}=1\n\nThen T=44, U to y=2, and so on, but I arrive later.\n\nTo avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at T=50 or 51, I need to be past y=8 by T=50 or before y=7 until after T=51.\n\nSince I start at y=0 at T=42, and I need to go to y=9.\n\nThe earliest I can be at y=7 is T=42 +7 =49, as before.\n\nIf I am at y=7 at T=49, I cannot go to y=8 at T=50 because blocked.\n\nSo I must stay at y=7 or go down, but that delays.\n\nI could go to y=7 later, after T=51.\n\nBut T=51 is later, so I would arrive at y=9 later, increasing H.\n\nBut minimal H might be achievable by waiting at some safe y.\n\nAnother idea: I can be on y=7 before T=50, say at T=48 or earlier.\n\nBut to be at y=7 at T=48, I need to have started earlier or gone faster.\n\nFrom y=0 at T=42, to y=7 at T=48: that means in 6 turns, I increased y by 7, which requires going up every turn, but from T=42 to T=48 is 6 actions: actions at T=42 to T=47, y from 0 to 7.\n\nAction at T=42: U, y_{43}=1\n\nT=43: U, y_{44}=2\n\n...\nT=47: U, y_{48}=7\n\nYes, at T=48, y=48}=7.\n\nThen at T=48, I am on y=7, freeway 7, which is safe at T=48 (not 50,51).\n\nThen I can take action at T=48: if I take U, go to y=8 at T=49.\n\nAt T=49, y=8, freeway 8, which is blocked? Freeway 8 blocked at T=50,51, not at T=49. T=49 is safe for y=8? Blocked times 42,43,50,51, so T=49 not blocked, safe.\n\nThen at T=49, y=8, I take U, go to y=9 at T=50.\n\nAt T=50, I am at y=9, which is not a freeway, so safe.\n\nAnd at T=50, I am on y=9, no freeway.\n\nNow, check if on previous freeways I was safe.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nT=42: y=0, safe, take U\n\nT=43: y=1, freeway 1, safe (not 58-61), take U\n\nT=44: y=2, freeway 2, safe, take U\n\nT=45: y=3, freeway 3, safe, take U\n\nT=46: y=4, freeway 4, safe, take U\n\nT=47: y=5, freeway 5, safe, take U\n\nT=48: y=6, freeway 6, safe (T=48>42), take U\n\nT=49: y=7, freeway 7, at T=49, not blocked (blocked at 42,43,50,51), so safe, take U\n\nT=50: y=8, freeway 8, at T=50, but freeway 8 blocked at T=50! Oh, problem.\n\nAt T=50, y=8, and freeway 8 blocked at T=50, so collision.\n\nI forgot that.\n\nIn this sequence, at T=49, I go to y=8, arriving at T=50, on y=8 at turn T=50, blocked.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt T=48, y=7, instead of going up, I could stay.\n\nSo at T=48: y=7, take S, stay at y=7 for T=49? Action at T=48: if S, then y_{49} = y_{48} +0 =7, so at T=49, still y=7.\n\nThen at T=49, y=7, freeway 7, which is safe at T=49 (not blocked), then I can take U to go to y=8 at T=50.\n\nBut at T=50, y=8, freeway 8 blocked.\n\nIf I take U at T=49, to y=8 at T=50, blocked.\n\nIf I stay again at T=49: take S, then y_{50}=7, at T=50, y=7, freeway 7, which is blocked at T=50! Yes, freeway 7 blocked at T=50.\n\nSo at T=50, if on y=7, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down, worse.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=7 or y=8 at T=50 or T=51.\n\nTherefore, at T=50 and T=51, I must not be on y=7 or y=8.\n\nThat means at those turns, I must be below y=7 or above y=8.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, I could be at y=9 or above, but y=9 is the goal, I can be there.\n\nOr below y=7, like y=6 or less.\n\nBut y=6 is safe at all times except T=42, but T=50 is fine.\n\nSimilarly, y=5, etc.\n\nIn the sequence, I need to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 during T=50 and T=51.\n\nSo, for example, I can be at y=7 before T=50, and leave to y=8 before T=50, so that by T=50, I am past y=8.\n\nOr I can arrive at y=7 after T=51.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 are close, let's think about the timing.\n\nSuppose I want to be on y=8 before T=50.\n\nFor example, at T=49, be on y=8.\n\nTo be at y=8 at T=49, I need to have y_{49}=8.\n\nFrom start, T=42, y=0.\n\nTo reach y=8 in 7 actions: from T=42 to T=48, 7 actions to go from y=0 to y=8.\n\nActions at T=42 to T=48 determine y_{49}.\n\ny_{49} = y_{42} + sum of Δy from t=42 to 48.\n\ny_{42}=0, so y_{49} = sum_{t=42 to 48} Δy_t\n\nEach Δy_t = -1,0,1.\n\nTo have y_{49}=8, I need the sum to be 8, so I must have 8 up actions and no down, but from t=42 to 48, that's 7 actions (t=42,43,44,45,46,47,48).\n\n7 actions, each can contribute +1 max, so max y_{49} =7 if all U.\n\nWith 7 actions, I can reach y=7 at T=49, as before, but not y=8.\n\ny_{49} is position at turn 49.\n\nAfter 7 actions from t=42 to t=48, I have y_{49}.\n\nWith k actions, I can increase y by at most k.\n\nFrom t=42 to t=48 inclusive, that's 7 actions: t=42,43,44,45,46,47,48.\n\nAfter these, y_{49} = 0 + sum_{i=0 to 6} Δy_{42+i}\n\nSet to 8, but max sum is 7, so impossible to be at y=8 at T=49.\n\nEarliest at y=8 is T=50, with 8 up actions: start T=42 y=0, after U at T=42, y_{43}=1; ... after U at T=49, y_{50}=8.\n\nBut at T=50, y=8, which is blocked.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=8 after T=51, say at T=52.\n\nThen I can be at y=8 at T=52, which is safe.\n\nBut that means I arrive later.\n\nSimilarly, for y=7.\n\nNow, about y=1, it has late blocking at T=58-61, but since I am going up early, I should be past y=1 before T=58, so no problem.\n\nT=58 is turn 58, I start at 42, if I go up directly, I am at y=9 by T=51 or so, before T=58.\n\nIn the direct path with delay.\n\nBack to avoiding the T=50,51 blockage.\n\nOptions:\n\n1. Be below y=7 at T=50 and T=51, and go up after.\n\n2. Be above y=8 at T=50 and T=51, but to be above y=8, I need to be at y=9 or more, but y=9 is goal.\n\nTo be at y=9 before T=50.\n\nEarliest at y=9: with 9 up actions, from T=42 to T=50.\n\ny_{51} =9 after actions from t=42 to t=50.\n\n9 actions.\n\nt=42 to t=50 inclusive: 9 actions.\n\ny_{51} = y_{42} + sum_{t=42 to 50} Δy_t\n\nSet to 9, so need sum=9, all U.\n\nThen at T=51, y=9, safe.\n\nNow, during the path, I need to be safe at each turn.\n\nAt T=50, where am I? In this sequence, at T=50, I am at y=8 if I go up all, but let's see.\n\nActions: all U from t=42 to t=50.\n\nT=42: a_{42}=U, y_{43}=1\n\nT=43: a_{43}=U, y_{44}=2\n\n...\nT=49: a_{49}=U, y_{50}=8\n\nT=50: a_{50}=U, y_{51}=9\n\nNow, at turn T=50, I am at y=8 (before action), take action U, go to y=9 at T=51.\n\nBut at T=50, I am on y=8, freeway 8, at turn T=50, which is blocked, so collision at T=50.\n\nIf I could be at y=9 at T=50.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at T=50, I need y_{50}=9.\n\ny_{50} = y_{42} + sum_{t=42 to 49} Δy_t\n\nt=42 to 49: 8 actions, max y_{50}=8, cannot be 9.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=9 before T=51.\n\nSimilarly, earliest at y=9 is T=51 with all up.\n\nBut at T=50, I am at y=8 if all up, which is blocked.\n\nSo I must not be at y=8 at T=50.\n\nTherefore, in the all-up sequence, at T=50 I am at y=8, blocked.\n\nSo I need to modify.\n\nOne way is to delay the ascent for y=7 and y=8.\n\nFor example, stay at some safe y before reaching y=7.\n\nSafe y like y=6, which is always safe.\n\nOr y=5, etc.\n\nSuppose I go up to y=6 quickly, then stay there during T=50 and T=51, then go up to y=7,8,9.\n\nLet's see the timing.\n\nFirst, go to y=6 as fast as possible.\n\nStart T=42, y=0, take U, to y=1 at T=43\n\nT=43, y=1, U to y=2 at T=44\n\nT=44, y=2, U to y=3 at T=45\n\nT=45, y=3, U to y=4 at T=46\n\nT=46, y=4, U to y=5 at T=47\n\nT=47, y=5, U to y=6 at T=48\n\nNow at T=48, y=6, safe.\n\nI can stay at y=6 for a few turns.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at T=50,51.\n\nSo at T=50 and T=51, I should be at y=6 or below or at y=9.\n\nBut y=9 not yet.\n\nSo at T=50 and T=51, be at y=6.\n\nThen after, go up.\n\nFor example, at T=48, y=6, I can take S, stay at y=6 for T=49\n\nT=49, y=6, take S, stay for T=50\n\nT=50, y=6, freeway 6, safe, take S, stay for T=51? I need to be at y=6 at T=51 as well.\n\nT=50: y=6, take S, then y_{51}=6, so at T=51, y=6.\n\nThen at T=51, y=6, take U, to y=7 at T=52\n\nT=52, y=7, freeway 7, at T=52, not 50 or 51, so safe (blocked only 42,43,50,51, T=52>51, safe), take U to y=8 at T=53\n\nT=53, y=8, freeway 8, at T=53, safe, take U to y=9 at T=54\n\nNow, at T=54, y=9, done.\n\nBut H= how many turns? Actions from t=42 to t=53? Let's list the turns.\n\nActions at t=42 to t=53.\n\nt=42: U\n\nt=43: U\n\nt=44: U\n\nt=45: U\n\nt=46: U\n\nt=47: U  // to y=6 at T=48\n\nt=48: S  // stay, y=6 at T=49\n\ny_{49} = y_{48} + Δy_{48}, at T=48 action, y_{49} = y_{48} + a_{48}, if S, Δy=0, so y_{49}=6\n\nSimilarly, t=49: S, y_{50}=6\n\nt=50: S, y_{51}=6\n\nt=51: U, y_{52}=7\n\nt=52: U, y_{53}=8\n\nt=53: U, y_{54}=9\n\nSo at turn t=53, action U, to y=9 at T=54.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t=42 to t=53, that's 12 actions: t=42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53.\n\nH=12 turns.\n\nBut y_{42+H} = y_{42+12} = y_{54} =9, so H=12.\n\nBut is this minimal? I wasted 3 turns staying at y=6.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=7 before T=50, then stay at y=7 until after T=51, but y=7 is blocked at T=50 and 51, so I cannot stay there.\n\nFreeway 7 blocked at T=50,51, so I cannot be on y=7 at those turns.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nSo I must not be on them at T=50,51.\n\nSo the only way is to be below or above.\n\nSince I cannot be above y=8 before T=51, I have to be below during T=50,51.\n\nThen go up after.\n\nBut in the above, I stayed at y=6 for three turns: T=49,50,51? In the sequence, at T=49, y=6; T=50, y=6; T=51, y=6; then go up.\n\nT=49 is not 50 or 51, but I stayed to avoid moving up during danger.\n\nI could stay fewer turns.\n\nFor example, if I am at y=6 at T=48, I can go to y=7 at T=49.\n\nAt T=49, y=7, which is safe (not 50,51).\n\nThen at T=49, instead of going to y=8, I can stay at y=7 for T=50? But at T=50, y=7 is blocked.\n\nCannot.\n\nAt T=49, y=7, take S, then y_{50}=7, at T=50 y=7 blocked.\n\nTake D, go to y=6 at T=50, but then at T=50, y=6, safe, but I went down, which is worse.\n\nThen from there I need to go up again.\n\nSo not efficient.\n\nTherefore, the best is to stay at a safe y during the danger period.\n\ny=6 is safe.\n\nNow, the danger period is T=50 and T=51, two turns.\n\nI need to be on y=6 (or below) at both T=50 and T=51.\n\nIf I am at y=6 at T=50, I can stay or move, but to be at y=6 at T=51, if I stay or go down, but going down bad.\n\nIf I stay at y=6 from some time.\n\nIn the sequence, I reached y=6 at T=48.\n\nThen I need to be at y=6 at T=50 and T=51.\n\nSo at T=48, y=6, I can take S at T=48, to be at y=6 at T=49.\n\nThen at T=49, y=6, take S to be at y=6 at T=50.\n\nThen at T=50, y=6, take S to be at y=6 at T=51.\n\nThen at T=51, y=6, take U to y=7 at T=52.\n\nBut I stayed three times: at T=48,49,50? Actions.\n\nAt T=48: I take S, so that at T=49, y=6\n\nT=49: take S, at T=50, y=6\n\nT=50: take S, at T=51, y=6\n\nT=51: take U, at T=52, y=7\n\nThen T=52: U to y=8 at T=53\n\nT=53: U to y=9 at T=54\n\nSame as before, H=12 actions from t=42 to t=53.\n\nBut at T=48, I was already at y=6, and I stayed at T=48 and T=49 to be at y=6 for T=50 and T=51.\n\nI don't need to be at y=6 at T=49; I only need at T=50 and T=51.\n\nI can be at y=6 earlier or later, but since I reach early, I can stay.\n\nBut to minimize H, I can go to y=6 later.\n\nFor example, start later or slow down.\n\nBut I start at T=42, I can delay the first move.\n\nSuppose at T=42, I take S, stay at y=0 for one turn.\n\nThen T=43, y=0, take U to y=1 at T=44\n\nThen U to y=2 at T=45, ..., up to T=49: y=6? Let's see.\n\nT=42: S, y_{43}=0\n\nT=43: U, y_{44}=1\n\nT=44: U, y_{45}=2\n\nT=45: U, y_{46}=3\n\nT=46: U, y_{47}=4\n\nT=47: U, y_{48}=5\n\nT=48: U, y_{49}=6\n\nNow at T=49, y=6.\n\nThen I need to be at y=6 at T=50 and T=51.\n\nSo at T=49, take S, y_{50}=6\n\nT=50, take S, y_{51}=6\n\nT=51, take U, y_{52}=7\n\nT=52: U, y_{53}=8\n\nT=53: U, y_{54}=9\n\nStill H=12, same as before.\n\nBut I started later, so same number.\n\nIf I go faster to y=6, I can stay more, but not better.\n\nAnother point: I can be at y=7 before T=50, say at T=48, as before, but then I cannot stay, so I have to go down or something, but worse.\n\nPerhaps I can go directly from y=6 to y=8 or something, but no, only one step per turn.\n\nUnless I stay, but no.\n\nSo I think staying at y=6 during T=50 and T=51 is necessary.\n\nBut T=50 and T=51 are two turns, so I need to be at y=6 for at least those turns, but since I have to be there, I can arrive earlier and stay, or arrive exactly.\n\nBut in terms of actions, minimal actions.\n\nNow, from start to y=6: to reach y=6 from y=0, I need at least 6 up actions, in at least 6 turns.\n\nSimilarly, from y=6 to y=9, need 3 up actions, in 3 turns.\n\nBut with the waiting, I have additional actions.\n\nIn the sequence, I have 6 actions to go from y=0 to y=6: for example, actions at t=42 to t=47: U each, y_{48}=6.\n\nThen from t=48 to t=50, I stay at y=6 for three turns? Actions at t=48,49,50: S each, so at T=51, y=51}=6.\n\nThen actions at t=51: U to y=7 at T=52\n\nt=52: U to y=8 at T=53\n\nt=53: U to y=9 at T=54\n\nSo actions: t=42 to t=53, 12 actions.\n\nBut I stayed at y=6 from T=48 to T=51, that's four turns at y=6: T=48,49,50,51.\n\nBut I only need to be safe at T=50 and T=51, which I am, but I was also at T=48 and 49, which is fine but unnecessary, but I have to be somewhere.\n\nTo save actions, I could be at y=6 only at T=50 and T=51, but I need to get there and leave.\n\nFor example, if I reach y=6 exactly at T=50.\n\nThen at T=50, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at T=50, I can stay or go up, but if I go up to y=7 at T=51, at T=51 y=7 blocked.\n\nSo I need to stay at y=6 at T=51 as well.\n\nSo I must be at y=6 at both T=50 and T=51.\n\nTherefore, I need to take action at T=49 such that y_{50}=6, and at T=50 such that y_{51}=6.\n\nThat means, at T=49, I must be at y=6 and take S, or if I am at y=5, take U, but let's see.\n\nTo have y_{50}=6, that means at turn T=49, I am at some position, and after action, y_{50}=6.\n\nSimilarly for y_{51}.\n\nBut at turn T=49, I am at y_{49}, take action, go to y_{50}.\n\nTo have y_{50}=6, either y_{49}=6 and take S, or y_{49}=5 and take U, or y_{49}=7 and take D, but taking D is bad.\n\nSimilarly for y_{51}=6.\n\nTo minimize actions, I should avoid going down, so probably arrive at y=6 and stay.\n\nNow, to have y_{50}=6, I can be at y=6 at T=49 and take S, or at y=5 at T=49 and take U to y=6 at T=50.\n\nSimilarly for y_{51}=6.\n\nBut if I am at y=5 at T=49 and take U to y=6 at T=50, then at T=50, y=6, good.\n\nThen for y_{51}=6, I need at T=50 to be at y=6 and take S, or at y=5 and take U, etc.\n\nBut since I am at y=6 at T=50, I can take S to stay at y=6 for T=51.\n\nThen at T=51, take U to y=7.\n\nNow, in this case, I reached y=6 at T=50.\n\nHow to reach y=6 at T=50.\n\nFrom start, T=42 y=0.\n\ny_{50} = y_{42} + sum_{t=42 to 49} Δy_t = 0 + sum of 8 actions (t=42 to 49) =6\n\nSo I need the sum of 8 actions to be 6, meaning I have 6 U and 2 S, for example, or other combinations, but since D is worse, use S.\n\nFor example, I can have two stay actions somewhere.\n\nThen from there, go up to y=9.\n\nBut let's see if I can save one turn.\n\nIn the previous, with 12 actions, I had 9 U and 3 S.\n\nWith 11 actions, I can have 9 U and 2 S, but I need to reach y=9 with sum of Δy=9.\n\nWith H actions, sum of Δy from t=42 to t=42+H-1 must be 9.\n\nEach action contributes at most +1, so H >=9.\n\nMinimal H=9 if all U, but we saw it causes collision.\n\nWith H=10, sum=9, so 9 U and one S or one D, but D worse, so one S.\n\nSimilarly, H=11: 9U and 2S, etc.\n\nNow, with H=10, I can have 9U and one S.\n\nI need to place the S somewhere to avoid the collision.\n\nNow, where to place the stay.\n\nIn the all-up sequence, collision at T=50 on y=8.\n\nAt T=50, I am at y=8, blocked.\n\nSo I need to not be at y=8 at T=50.\n\nIf I stay somewhere, I might be at different position at T=50.\n\nFor example, if I stay at an earlier turn, I arrive later.\n\nSuppose I insert a stay at some point before reaching high y.\n\nFor instance, at T=42, take S, then y_{43}=0, then all U to y=9 at T=52? Let's see.\n\nT=42: S, y_{43}=0\n\nThen T=43: U, y_{44}=1\n\n...\n\nUp to T=50: U, y_{51}=8? T=43 U to y=1 at T=44? T=43 action U, y_{44}=1\n\nT=44 U, y_{45}=2\n\n...\n\nT=49 U, y_{50}=7\n\nT=50 U, y_{51}=8\n\nAt T=50, y=50}=7? At T=50, before action, y=7, take U to y=8 at T=51.\n\nBut at T=50, y=7, freeway 7, which is blocked at T=50! Collision.\n\nIf I take S at T=49.\n\nT=42: U, y_{43}=1\n\n...\nT=48: U, y_{49}=7\n\nT=49: S, y_{50}=7\n\nBut at T=49, y=7, safe? T=49 not blocked, but at T=50, y=7, blocked, so when I take S at T=49, at T=50 I am at y=7, collision.\n\nIf I take S at T=48.\n\nT=42: U, y_{43}=1\n\n...\nT=47: U, y_{48}=6\n\nT=48: S, y_{49}=6\n\nT=49: U, y_{50}=7\n\nAt T=50, y=50}=7? At T=50, y=7, blocked.\n\nSame.\n\nTo avoid being at y=7 or y=8 at T=50, I need to be at lower y at T=50.\n\nFor example, at T=50, be at y=6.\n\nThen at T=50, y=6, safe.\n\nThen go up from there.\n\nBut with all up except one stay, I can have y_{50} less than 8.\n\nFor example, with H=10 actions.\n\nActions from t=42 to t=51? y_{52} =9.\n\nWith 10 actions, y_{42+10} = y_{52} =9.\n\ny_{52} = sum_{t=42 to 51} Δy_t =9\n\nSince 10 actions, to sum to 9, I must have 9 U and 1 S.\n\nNow, where to place the S.\n\nIf I place S at an early turn, say at t=42: S, then y_{43}=0\n\nThen t=43 to t=51: 9 U, y_{52}=9\n\nNow, positions:\n\nT=42: y=0, safe\n\nT=43: y=0 (after S), but at T=43, I am at y=0, not freeway, safe? y=0 is not freeway, so no collision.\n\nThen T=44: y=1 (after U at t=43), freeway 1, safe\n\nT=45: y=2, safe\n\n...\n\nT=49: y=6, safe\n\nT=50: y=7, freeway 7, at T=50, blocked! Collision.\n\nBecause at T=50, y=7.\n\nIf I place S later.\n\nSuppose place S at t=47.\n\nThen:\n\nt=42: U, y_{43}=1\n\nt=43: U, y_{44}=2\n\nt=44: U, y_{45}=3\n\nt=45: U, y_{46}=4\n\nt=46: U, y_{47}=5\n\nt=47: S, y_{48}=5\n\nt=48: U, y_{49}=6\n\nt=49: U, y_{50}=7\n\nAt T=50, y=50}=7, blocked.\n\nSame.\n\nPlace S at t=48.\n\nt=42: U, y_{43}=1\n\nt=43: U, y_{44}=2\n\nt=44: U, y_{45}=3\n\nt=45: U, y_{46}=4\n\nt=46: U, y_{47}=5\n\nt=47: U, y_{48}=6\n\nt=48: S, y_{49}=6\n\nt=49: U, y_{50}=7\n\nAt T=50, y=50}=7, blocked.\n\nStill.\n\nPlace S at t=49.\n\nt=42: U, y_{43}=1\n\n...\n\nt=48: U, y_{49}=7\n\nt=49: S, y_{50}=7\n\nAt T=50, y=50}=7, blocked.\n\nAlways at T=50, I am at y=7 if I have one stay.\n\nBecause with 9 U and one S, I reach y=8 at T=51 if all up, but with one stay, at T=50, y=7 or less, but in the paths above, at T=50, y=7 when I place S early or late.\n\nThe only way to have lower y at T=50 is to place the stay such that I am behind.\n\nFor example, if I place S at t=42, at T=50: y=7 as above.\n\nIf I place S at t=43: t=42 U, y43=1; t=43 S, y44=1; then t=44 U, y45=2; ... up to t=50 U, y51=8? Let's list y at each turn.\n\nTurn T | y_T | after action of previous turn.\n\nAt T=42, y=0\n\na42: if S, y43=0\n\na43: if U, y44=1\n\nBut for the position at turn T, it is y_T.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T, and take action a_T.\n\nFor collision, at turn T, y_T.\n\nIn this case, with a42=S, a43=S? No, we have one S only.\n\nH=10 actions, 9U 1S.\n\nSuppose a42=S, then at T=43, y=0\n\na43=U, y44=1\n\na44=U, y45=2\n\na45=U, y46=3\n\na46=U, y47=4\n\na47=U, y48=5\n\na48=U, y49=6\n\na49=U, y50=7\n\na50=U, y51=8\n\na51=U, y52=9\n\nNow at each turn:\n\nT=42: y=0, safe\n\nT=43: y=0 (after a42=S), not freeway, safe\n\nT=44: y=1, freeway 1, safe (T=44 not 58-61)\n\nT=45: y=2, safe\n\nT=46: y=3, safe\n\nT=47: y=4, safe\n\nT=48: y=5, safe\n\nT=49: y=6, safe\n\nT=50: y=7, freeway 7, T=50 blocked! Collision.\n\nIf I place the S later, same thing.\n\nSuppose a42=U, a43=U, ..., up to a47=U, then a48=S, then a49=U, a50=U, a51=U.\n\nThen:\n\ny42=0\n\na42=U, y43=1\n\na43=U, y44=2\n\na44=U, y45=3\n\na45=U, y46=4\n\na46=U, y47=5\n\na47=U, y48=6\n\na48=S, y49=6\n\na49=U, y50=7\n\na50=U, y51=8\n\na51=U, y52=9\n\nAt turns:\n\nT=42: y=0, safe\n\nT=43: y=1, safe\n\n...\n\nT=48: y=6, safe\n\nT=49: y=6 (after a48=S), freeway 6, safe\n\nT=50: y=7 (after a49=U), at T=50, y=7, freeway 7, blocked, collision.\n\nAlways at T=50, I am at y=7 and it is blocked.\n\nBecause with one stay, I am one step behind, so at T=50, y=7 instead of y=8.\n\nBut y=7 is also blocked at T=50.\n\nSimilarly, if I place the stay even later, at T=50 I might be at y=6 or 7, but in this case y=7.\n\nTo be at y=6 at T=50, I need to have only 6 net up to that point.\n\nBut with actions from t=42 to t=49, 8 actions, to have y_{50} = sum of 8 actions =6, so I need two less, so two S or one S and one D, etc., but with one S only for H=10, I can't have y_{50}=6.\n\nWith H=10 actions, y_{52} =9, so for y_{50}, it is after 8 actions? y_{50} = y_{42} + sum_{t=42 to 49} a_t, 8 actions.\n\nIf all U, y_{50}=8, with one S, y_{50}=7, with two S, y_{50}=6, but with H=10, I have only one S, so y_{50}=7.\n\nThus, with H=10, at T=50, I am at y=7, which is blocked, so collision unavoidable with H=10.\n\nTherefore, H=10 is impossible.\n\nNow H=11: 9U and 2S.\n\nI can have y_{50} =6 or 7, etc.\n\nFor example, with two S, I can have y_{50}=6.\n\nThen at T=50, y=6, safe.\n\nThen I can go up to y=9.\n\nSimilarly, I need to be safe at T=51.\n\nIf at T=50 y=6, I take U, to y=7 at T=51, but at T=51 y=7 blocked.\n\nSo I need to stay at y=6 or something.\n\nLet's plan.\n\nI need to be at y=6 at T=50 and at T=51.\n\nBecause if at T=50 y=6, and I take U, to y=7 at T=51, blocked.\n\nIf I take S at T=50, y_{51}=6, then at T=51 y=6, safe.\n\nThen at T=51, I can take U to y=7 at T=52, etc.\n\nSo, with H=11, I can do it.\n\nFor example:\n\nActions:\n\nt=42: U\n\nt=43: U\n\nt=44: U\n\nt=45: U\n\nt=46: U  // to y=5 at T=47? Let's list y.\n\nT=42: y=0, a42=U, y43=1\n\nT=43: y=1, a43=U, y44=2\n\nT=44: y=2, a44=U, y45=3\n\nT=45: y=3, a45=U, y46=4\n\nT=46: y=4, a46=U, y47=5\n\nNow I need to have y_{50}=6.\n\ny_{50} = y_{42} + sum_{t=42 to 49} a_t = 0 + sum of 8 actions.\n\nTo have y_{50}=6, I need sum=6, so with 8 actions, I need 6U and 2S, for example.\n\nSimilarly, for the remaining actions.\n\nNow, I place two S somewhere in the first part.\n\nFor example, place S at t=46 and t=47? Let's see.\n\nTo reach y_{50}=6.\n\nSet the actions from t=42 to t=49 such that sum_{t=42 to 49} Δy_t =6.\n\nWith 8 actions, 6U and 2S.\n\nFor example, S at t=42 and t=43: but that delays.\n\nTo minimize H, place S not at start.\n\nBut H is fixed for now.\n\nPlace S at t=47 and t=48, for instance.\n\nt=42: U, y43=1\n\nt=43: U, y44=2\n\nt=44: U, y45=3\n\nt=45: U, y46=4\n\nt=46: U, y47=5\n\nt=47: S, y48=5  // S, stay\n\nt=48: S, y49=5  // another S, but I need y50=6, not 5.\n\ny49=5 after t=48 action.\n\nThen t=49: need to go to y50=6, so U, y50=6\n\nThen at T=50, y=6.\n\nNow actions: t=42 to t=49: 8 actions, with 6U and 2S? t=42 U,43 U,44 U,45 U,46 U,47 S,48 S,49 U: that's 6U and 2S, sum Δy=6, y50=6.\n\nYes.\n\nThen at T=50, y=6, I need to set action for t=50.\n\nI need y51=6 for safety at T=51.\n\nSo at t=50, take S, so y51=6.\n\nThen at T=51, y=6, take U, y52=7\n\nThen t=51: U, y52=7? t=50 action S, y51=6\n\nThen at T=51, y=6, take a51=U, y52=7\n\nThen t=52: U, y53=8\n\nt=53: U, y54=9\n\nBut I have only 11 actions? t=42 to t=52? y_{53}=9.\n\nActions: t=42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52\n\nThat's 11 actions.\n\ny_{53}=9.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nt=42: U\n\nt=43: U\n\nt=44: U\n\nt=45: U\n\nt=46: U\n\nt=47: S  // y48=5? After t=47 action, y48 = y47 + Δy47\n\nAt T=47, y=5 (after t=46 U), a47=S, so y48=5 +0=5\n\nT=48: y=5, a48=S, y49=5\n\nT=49: y=5, a49=U, y50=6\n\nT=50: y=6, a50=S, y51=6\n\nT=51: y=6, a51=U, y52=7\n\nT=52: y=7, a52=U, y53=8\n\ny53=8, not 9.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\na52=U, y53=8\n\nThen I need another action to go to y=9.\n\nt=53: U, y54=9\n\nBut that adds one more action.\n\nActions t=42 to t=53, 12 actions.\n\nWith 11 actions to y_{53}, but y_{53}=8 in this case, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9, I need at least 9 up actions.\n\nIn 11 actions, with 9U and 2S, I can reach y=9.\n\nIn the above, I used only 6U in the first 8 actions, but I need more.\n\nLet's specify.\n\nI want y_{52}=9 with 11 actions from t=42 to t=51? y_{52} = sum_{t=42 to 51} a_t =9\n\n11 actions, 9U and 2S.\n\nNow, I need to be at y=6 at T=50 and T=51.\n\ny_{50} must be 6.\n\ny_{50} = sum_{t=42 to 49} a_t\n\nSet sum_{t=42 to 49} a_t =6 with 8 actions.\n\nFor example, 6U and 2S.\n\nThen y_{50}=6.\n\nAt T=50, y=6, take a50=S, so y51=6\n\nAt T=51, y=6, take a51=U, y52=7\n\nBut I need to go to y=9, so I need more actions.\n\na52=U, y53=8\n\na53=U, y54=9, but that's 12 actions.\n\nWith a51=U, y52=7, then to reach y=9, I need two more U, but with a52 and a53, but H increases.\n\nSince I have two S already, and I need 9U, with 11 actions, I can have 9U and 2S, so y_{52}=9.\n\nBut to have y_{52}=9, and y_{50}=6, that means from t=50 and t=51, I need to increase y by 3, but only two actions, impossible.\n\ny_{52} = y_{50} + Δy_{50} + Δy_{51}\n\nIf y_{50}=6, then to have y_{52}=9, need Δy_{50} + Δy_{51} =3, but each at most 1, so impossible.\n\nTherefore, with y_{50}=6, I cannot reach y=9 by T=52 with only two more actions.\n\nThe earliest I can reach y=9 is T=53 with y_{53}=9, as before.\n\nIf I set y_{50}=7, but with 9U and 2S, y_{50} could be 7 if the S are placed to have sum=7 for first 8 actions.\n\nFor example, 7U and 1S in first 8 actions.\n\nThen y_{50}=7.\n\nBut at T=50, y=7, blocked, not good.\n\nSo I cannot have y_{50}=7.\n\nTherefore, the only way is to have y_{50}=6 or less, but with y_{50}=6, I need to go to y=9, which takes at least 3 more actions, so y_{53}=9 with 11 actions? With 11 actions, y_{53}= y_{42} + sum_{t=42 to 52} a_t\n\nt=42 to 52 is 11 actions.\n\ny_{53} = sum_{t=42 to 52} Δy_t\n\nSet to 9.\n\nWith 11 actions, 9U and 2S.\n\ny_{50} = sum_{t=42 to 49} Δy_t\n\nWith 8 actions.\n\nIf I set sum_{t=42 to 49} Δy_t =6, with 6U and 2S.\n\nThen y_{50}=6.\n\nThen a50=S, y51=6\n\na51=U, y52=7\n\na52=U, y53=8\n\ny53=8, not 9.\n\nThen I need a53: U, y54=9, with 12 actions.\n\nIf after y_{50}=6, I take U at t=50, but then y51=7, at T=51 y=7 blocked.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo the minimal is H=12 with the first plan.\n\nBut let's confirm the sequence.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\nActions:\n\nt=42: U  // to y=1 at T=43\n\nt=43: U  // to y=2 at T=44\n\nt=44: U  // to y=3 at T=45\n\nt=45: U  // to y=4 at T=46\n\nt=46: U  // to y=5 at T=47\n\nt=47: U  // to y=6 at T=48\n\nt=48: S  // stay, y=6 at T=49\n\nt=49: S  // stay, y=6 at T=50\n\nt=50: S  // stay, y=6 at T=51\n\nt=51: U  // to y=7 at T=52\n\nt=52: U  // to y=8 at T=53\n\nt=53: U  // to y=9 at T=54\n\nNow, H=12 actions, from t=42 to t=53.\n\nAt each turn:\n\nT=42: y=0, safe\n\nT=43: y=1, freeway 1, safe (T=43 not 58-61)\n\nT=44: y=2, freeway 2, safe\n\nT=45: y=3, freeway 3, safe\n\nT=46: y=4, freeway 4, safe\n\nT=47: y=5, freeway 5, safe\n\nT=48: y=6, freeway 6, safe (T=48>42)\n\nT=49: y=6, freeway 6, safe\n\nT=50: y=6, freeway 6, safe\n\nT=51: y=6, freeway 6, safe\n\nT=52: y=7, freeway 7, T=52 not 50 or 51, safe\n\nT=53: y=8, freeway 8, T=53 not 50 or 51, safe\n\nAnd at T=54, y=9, not shown, but we don't care.\n\nIn the actions, last action at t=53, to y=9 at T=54.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t=42 to t=53.\n\nIn the answer, it should be for turns t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nt1=42, H=12, so turns 42 to 53.\n\nActions: as above.\n\nBut I have three S at t=48,49,50, but I only needed two for T=50 and T=51, but at T=49 I also stayed, which is fine but not necessary, but I can remove one stay.\n\nAt T=48, I am at y=6, I can go directly to stay for T=50 and T=51, but I need to be at y=6 at T=50 and T=51.\n\nAt T=48, y=6, I can take U to go to y=7 at T=49.\n\nAt T=49, y=7, which is safe (not blocked), then I can take D to go to y=6 at T=50, but that wastes a action.\n\nThen at T=50, y=6, take S to stay for T=51, etc.\n\nBut with down, it takes more actions.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=48: U, y49=7  // at T=49, y=7, safe\n\nt=49: D, y50=6  // to y=6 at T=50\n\nt=50: S, y51=6  // stay\n\nt=51: U, y52=7\n\netc., but now I have an extra down, so to reach y=9, I need more actions, worse.\n\nSo better to stay at y=6 from T=48 to T=51 with three S, but I can stay only from T=49 to T=51, but I need to reach y=6 at T=49.\n\nIn the sequence, I reached y=6 at T=48, so I can stay from T=48 to T=50 for the positions, but at T=51 I also need to be at y=6.\n\nPerhaps start the stay later.\n\nBut with H=12, it's acceptable.\n\nNow, about freeway 1 blocked at T=58-61, but I am at y=9 at T=54, before T=58, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, no other blocks.\n\nSo minimal H is 12.\n\nBut is there a way with H=11?\n\nSuppose I go up to y=7 at T=49, which is safe, then instead of going to y=8, I stay at y=7 for T=50? But at T=50, y=7 blocked, cannot.\n\nOr go down to y=6 at T=50.\n\nThen at T=50, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at T=51, I need to be at y=6, so take S, y51=6.\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut let's see the actions.\n\nt=42: U, y43=1\n\n...\n\nt=48: U, y49=7  // to y=7 at T=49\n\nAt T=49, y=7, safe, take a49=D, then y50=6\n\nAt T=50, y=6, safe, take a50=S, y51=6\n\nAt T=51, y=6, take a51=U, y52=7\n\na52=U, y53=8\n\na53=U, y54=9\n\nStill 12 actions, and I used a down, which is worse than stay.\n\nNo gain.\n\nStart from y=0 later, but same.\n\nSo H=12 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the sequence.\n\nIn the sequence, I have three stays at t=48,49,50.\n\nBut at t=49, I could have gone up if possible, but not.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=6 later.\n\nFor example, with one less up early.\n\nBut I think 12 is fine.\n\nNow, write the action sequence.\n\nTurn t_1 =42.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: U\n\nTurn 45: U\n\nTurn 46: U\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nTurn 48: S\n\nTurn 49: S\n\nTurn 50: S\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nAfter that, at T=54, y=9.\n\nH=12 turns.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 6 at T=42, but I was not on it.\n\nAlso, for freeway 7 and 8, I avoided T=50,51.\n\ny=1 at T=43, no issue.\n\nSo I think this works.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 42\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the sequence of actions must account for the blocked times on certain freeways. The key blocked periods are:\n- Freeway 7 and 8 are blocked at turns 50 and 51.\n- Freeway 1 is blocked at turns 58 to 61, but this does not affect the path since the goal is reached before turn 58.\n- Other freeways are either always safe or have no relevant blocking for the minimal path.\n\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 12, achieved by going up to \\(y = 6\\) as quickly as possible, staying at \\(y = 6\\) during turns 50 and 51 to avoid the blockage on freeways 7 and 8, and then proceeding to \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n- At turn 42, move up to reach \\(y = 1\\) at turn 43.\n- Continue moving up each turn until reaching \\(y = 6\\) at turn 48.\n- Stay at \\(y = 6\\) for turns 49, 50, and 51 to avoid being on freeways 7 or 8 during the blocked turns 50 and 51.\n- After the danger period, move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 52, \\(y = 8\\) at turn 53, and \\(y = 9\\) at turn 54.\n\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{t}\\}_{t=42}^{53}\\) is:\n\n- Turn 42: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 43)\n- Turn 43: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 44)\n- Turn 44: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 45)\n- Turn 45: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 46)\n- Turn 46: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 47)\n- Turn 47: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 48)\n- Turn 48: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 6\\) at turn 49)\n- Turn 49: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 6\\) at turn 50)\n- Turn 50: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 6\\) at turn 51)\n- Turn 51: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 52)\n- Turn 52: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 53)\n- Turn 53: \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 54)\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions:\n- At turn 42: \\(y = 0\\), not a freeway, safe.\n- Turns 43 to 47: On freeways 1 to 5, all safe at these times.\n- Turns 48 to 51: On freeway 6, safe for \\(T \\geq 43\\).\n- Turn 52: On freeway 7, safe as \\(T = 52\\) not blocked (blocked at 42, 43, 50, 51).\n- Turn 53: On freeway 8, safe as \\(T = 53\\) not blocked (blocked at 42, 43, 50, 51).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 42: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 43: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 44: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 45: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 46: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 47: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 48: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 49: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 50: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 51: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 52: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 53: U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 45 and the player is at (0,3). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to 8).\n\nThe car update rules: \n  - Left-moving: span moves left (decreasing x) at speed s per turn.\n  - Right-moving: span moves right (increasing x) at speed s per turn.\n\nBut note: the cars are defined with (head, tail, direction, speed). The representation of the span for left vs right is different:\n  - For a right-moving car: the span is [tail, head] and moves right? Actually, the problem says:\n      Right-moving: [τ, h] becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n  - Similarly, left-moving: [h, τ] becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n\nHowever, in the given state, all cars are right-moving? Let me check the directions: \n  Freeway 1: (-39, -50, right, 3) -> since direction is right, we use the right-moving update. But note the representation: for right-moving, the car is defined as (head, tail) = (-39, -50) but the problem says for right-moving the span is [τ, h]. So here τ = -50, h = -39. Then at time t1 (current turn 45), the span is [-50, -39]. Then at time T, the span becomes [-50 + 3*(T-45), -39 + 3*(T-45)].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nCollision condition: at turn T, if the player is at (0, y_T) and if at that turn there is a car on freeway y_T that has 0 in its span, then collision.\n\nImportant note: when the player moves from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, at turn T the player is still on y_T. Then at turn T+1, the player is on y_{T+1}. So we only check the freeway corresponding to the current y at each turn.\n\nGoal: find a sequence of actions (U, D, S) that moves the player from y=3 to y=9 in minimal H (number of turns) without any collision.\n\nWe must avoid the cars on freeways 1 to 8. The player starts at y=3, so at the initial turn (t1=45) we are at y=3 and we must check for collision at (0,3) on freeway 3? But note: the freeways are y=1,...,8. So at each turn, we check the car on the freeway corresponding to the current y.\n\nLet me denote:\n  At turn T (relative to t1=45, so absolute turn is 45 + t, where t>=0), the player is at y_t (with t starting at 0 for the first action at turn 45).\n\nWe start at turn 0 (absolute 45): y0 = 3.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway and each car, the span at absolute turn T (T = 45 + t).\n\nBut note: the collision condition is only when the player is at (0, y) and at that same turn, the freeway y has a car whose span covers 0.\n\nWe are to plan the actions for t=0 to t=H-1, and at turn t=H-1 we must be at y=9.\n\nWe can move up (U: +1), down (D: -1) or stay (S: 0). The y must be in [0,9]. We start at 3, goal at 9. The minimal number of moves without obstacles would be 6 (only U moves). But we have obstacles on the freeways.\n\nWe must avoid being at a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at a turn when a car on that freeway has 0 in its span.\n\nWe are going to simulate the movement and the car positions over time.\n\nFirst, let's list the cars per freeway (k from 1 to 8):\n\nFreeway 1: [ (h=-39, τ=-50, d='right', s=3) ]\n  At absolute turn T, the car's span: \n      [ -50 + 3*(T-45), -39 + 3*(T-45) ]\n\nFreeway 2: [ (h=-36, τ=-47, d='right', s=12) ]\n  Span: [ -47 + 12*(T-45), -36 + 12*(T-45) ]\n\nFreeway 3: [ (h=-36, τ=-47, d='right', s=12) ]\n  Span: [ -47 + 12*(T-45), -36 + 12*(T-45) ]\n\nFreeway 4: [ (h=-36, τ=-47, d='right', s=12) ]\n  Same as above.\n\nFreeway 5: [ (h=-36, τ=-47, d='right', s=12) ]\n  Same.\n\nFreeway 6: two cars: \n  car1: (h=-36, τ=-47, d='right', s=12) -> span: [ -47 + 12*(T-45), -36 + 12*(T-45) ]\n  car2: (h=36, τ=25, d='right', s=12) -> note: for right, the representation is (head, tail) = (36,25) meaning the span is [25,36] at T=45.\n        at T: [25 + 12*(T-45), 36 + 12*(T-45)]\n\nFreeway 7: two cars:\n  car1: (h=-30, τ=-41, d='right', s=6) -> span at T: [ -41 + 6*(T-45), -30 + 6*(T-45) ]\n  car2: (h=18, τ=7, d='right', s=6) -> span at T: [7 + 6*(T-45), 18 + 6*(T-45)]\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7? \n  car1: (h=-30, τ=-41, d='right', s=6) -> [ -41 + 6*(T-45), -30 + 6*(T-45) ]\n  car2: (h=18, τ=7, d='right', s=6) -> [7 + 6*(T-45), 18 + 6*(T-45)]\n\nNow, we need to check for each freeway and for each turn T (absolute) whether 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nBut note: we only care about the freeway that the player is on at that turn.\n\nWe are going to plan a path from y=3 to y=9. The minimal H would be at least 6 (if we go up 6 times). However, we must avoid collisions.\n\nLet me compute the times when each freeway has a car that covers 0.\n\nFor a freeway, we have one or two cars. We need to check for each car the time interval [T1, T2] during which 0 is in the car's span.\n\nBut note: the car moves continuously in integer time steps? The span moves at each turn by s units.\n\nWe can compute the times T (absolute) when 0 is in the span for a car.\n\nExample for freeway 1 (only one car):\n   Span at T: [ -50 + 3*(T-45), -39 + 3*(T-45) ]\n   We require: -50 + 3*(T-45) <= 0 <= -39 + 3*(T-45)\n\n   Solve:\n     -50 + 3*(T-45) <= 0  => 3*(T-45) <= 50 => T-45 <= 50/3 ≈ 16.666 => T <= 45 + 16.666 = 61.666 -> T <= 61 (since integer)\n     and 0 <= -39 + 3*(T-45) => 39 <= 3*(T-45) => 13 <= T-45 => T>=58.\n\n   So T in [58, 61] (absolute turns) the car on freeway 1 will cover 0.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2 (and similarly 3,4,5) with the same car parameters:\n   Span: [ -47 + 12*(T-45), -36 + 12*(T-45) ]\n   Condition: -47 + 12*(T-45) <= 0 <= -36 + 12*(T-45)\n   => 12*(T-45) <= 47 => T-45 <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916 => T <= 48 (since 45+3.916 -> 48.916 -> T<=48)\n        and 12*(T-45) >= 36 => T-45 >= 3 => T>=48.\n\n   So T=48.\n\n   Let me check: at T=48: \n        -47 + 12*(3) = -47+36 = -11, -36+36=0 -> so the span is [-11,0]. Then 0 is included? \n        Actually, the condition is inclusive: so yes, 0 is the right endpoint -> included.\n\n   But wait: the problem says \"if 0 is in the span\", and the span is [a,b] meaning a<=x<=b? Then at T=48: the span is [-11,0] -> includes 0.\n\n   However, at T=49: \n        -47 + 12*4 = -47+48 = 1, and -36+48=12 -> [1,12] -> doesn't include 0.\n\n   So freeway 2: only at T=48.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3,4,5: same as freeway 2 -> only at T=48.\n\nFreeway 6 has two cars.\n\nCar1: same as freeway2: so at T=48, it covers 0? \n   But note: at T=48, car1: [ -47+12*3, -36+12*3] = [-11,0] -> includes 0.\n\nCar2: \n   Span at T: [25 + 12*(T-45), 36 + 12*(T-45)]\n   Condition: 25+12*(T-45) <= 0 <= 36+12*(T-45) \n   -> The left part: 25+12*(T-45) <=0 -> 12*(T-45) <= -25 -> which is impossible because T>=45 -> positive or zero. \n   So car2 never covers 0.\n\nTherefore, freeway 6: only at T=48 (because of car1) the freeway has 0 covered.\n\nFreeway 7 (and 8) with two cars:\n\nCar1: [ -41 + 6*(T-45), -30 + 6*(T-45) ]\n   Condition: -41+6*(T-45) <=0<= -30+6*(T-45)\n   => 6*(T-45) <=41 -> T-45 <=41/6≈6.833 -> T<=51 (since 45+6.833=51.833 -> T<=51)\n        and 6*(T-45) >=30 -> T-45>=5 -> T>=50.\n\n   So T in [50,51] (absolute turns).\n\nCar2: [7+6*(T-45), 18+6*(T-45)]\n   Condition: 7+6*(T-45)<=0<=18+6*(T-45)\n   -> The left part: 7+6*(T-45)<=0 -> 6*(T-45)<=-7 -> impossible for T>=45.\n\nSo freeway 7: only car1 causes 0 to be covered at T=50 and T=51.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same as freeway7 -> covered at T=50,51.\n\nSummary of dangerous times per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: T in {58,59,60,61}\nFreeway 2: T=48\nFreeway 3: T=48\nFreeway 4: T=48\nFreeway 5: T=48\nFreeway 6: T=48\nFreeway 7: T in {50,51}\nFreeway 8: T in {50,51}\n\nNow, note that the player starts at turn 45 (T0=45) at y=3.\n\nWe plan to move from y=3 to y=9. The minimal moves is 6 steps: 6 U moves.\n\nBut we must avoid being at a freeway when the freeway is dangerous at the current turn.\n\nWe'll simulate the moves and check for collisions.\n\nWe are at turn 45 (absolute T=45) at y=3. We must check freeway 3 at T=45: \n   freeway3: at T=45: [ -47+0, -36+0] = [-47,-36] -> 0 not in there -> safe.\n\nWe can consider a BFS over (y, time_elapsed) to find the minimal H. But note the absolute time matters because the car positions change.\n\nWe denote:\n   t: the number of turns passed since t1 (so absolute turn T = 45 + t)\n   y: current y position (0..9)\n\nWe start at (t=0, y=3). We want to reach y=9 at the earliest t.\n\nAt each state (t, y), we can take an action: U, D, S -> next y' = y + {+1, -1, 0} (clamped to [0,9] but we are in [0,9] so no clamp needed? Actually, if at y=0 and D, then y remains 0; at y=9 and U, remains 9).\n\nBut we must avoid collisions. At the current state (t, y) we are at absolute turn T=45+t. We must check if at that turn, the freeway y (if y is between 1 and 8) has a car that covers 0.\n\nNote: if y=0 or y=9, there are no freeways? The freeways are only from 1 to 8. So at y=0 and y=9, no collision check (safe).\n\nSo the dangerous y are from 1 to 8.\n\nIn our problem, we start at y=3 (freeway3) and goal at y=9 (safe).\n\nWe need to avoid:\n\n- At freeway 1: dangerous at absolute T in {58,59,60,61} -> relative t = T-45: t in {13,14,15,16}\n- At freeway 2: dangerous at T=48 -> relative t=3\n- At freeway 3: dangerous at T=48 -> relative t=3\n- At freeway 4: dangerous at T=48 -> relative t=3\n- At freeway 5: dangerous at T=48 -> relative t=3\n- At freeway 6: dangerous at T=48 -> relative t=3\n- At freeway 7: dangerous at T in {50,51} -> relative t in {5,6}\n- At freeway 8: dangerous at T in {50,51} -> relative t in {5,6}\n\nNow, we want to go from (0,3) to (t,9) for some t, with minimal t.\n\nWe can only move one step per turn (or stay). We can also move down, but that would increase t.\n\nWe try to go up as much as possible.\n\nIdeal: 6 steps: t=6 -> absolute T=51. But at t=6 (T=51) we would be at y=9 (safe). However, we must check the intermediate steps.\n\nWe simulate step by step:\n\nTurn0 (t=0, absolute T=45): y=3 -> safe (as computed above).\n\nAction at turn0: we can choose U, D, S.\n\nWe want minimal H so we prefer U.\n\nBut we must avoid dangerous times.\n\nWe plan a path:\n\nOption 1: go straight up.\n\nStep0: T=45, y=3 -> safe.\nStep1: at turn1 (T=46) we are at y=4? Only if we choose U at step0.\n\nBut at step1 (T=46) we are at y=4. Check freeway4: dangerous at T=48? Not yet. At T=46: freeway4 car: [ -47+12*(46-45)= -47+12=-35, -36+12=-24] -> [-35,-24] -> no 0 -> safe.\n\nStep2: T=47, y=5 -> freeway5: car at T=47: [ -47+12*2 = -47+24=-23, -36+24=-12] -> no 0 -> safe.\n\nStep3: T=48, y=6 -> freeway6: dangerous at T=48? Yes. So at T=48, freeway6 has a car that covers 0. Therefore, if we are at y=6 at T=48, we crash.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=6 at T=48.\n\nTherefore, the straight up path fails at step3.\n\nWe must avoid being at freeway6 at T=48.\n\nWe have several options:\n\nOption A: wait at some safe freeway until T=49 (so that freeway6 is safe again) and then continue.\n\nOption B: take a detour? But we are going up, we don't want to go down.\n\nBut note: we can also stay at a freeway for one turn to avoid the dangerous time.\n\nWe are at step2: T=47, y=5 (which is safe). Instead of moving to y=6 at T=48 (which is dangerous for freeway6), we can stay at y=5 for one more turn? Then at T=48 we are at y=5. But freeway5 is dangerous at T=48? Yes, because freeway5 has a car that covers 0 at T=48. So we cannot be at y=5 at T=48 either.\n\nWhat about y=4 at T=48? freeway4: dangerous at T=48 -> same as above: all freeways 2,3,4,5,6 are dangerous at T=48.\n\nWhat about y=3? freeway3: dangerous at T=48 -> crash.\n\ny=2? freeway2: dangerous at T=48 -> crash.\n\ny=1? freeway1: at T=48: [ -50+3*(48-45) = -50+9=-41, -39+9=-30] -> [-41,-30] -> no 0 -> safe.\n\nSo at T=48, the only safe freeways are freeway1 and freeway7? freeway7: dangerous at T=50,51, not at 48.\n\nBut freeway7: at T=48: \n   car1: [ -41+6*(48-45)= -41+18=-23, -30+18=-12] -> no 0 -> safe.\n   car2: [7+6*3=7+18=25, 18+18=36] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway7 is safe at T=48.\n\nSimilarly, freeway8: same as freeway7 -> safe.\n\nBut we are at y=5 at T=47. We cannot go from y=5 to y=7 in one step? We can only move by 1 per turn. So at T=48 we can only be at y=4,5,6.\n\nWe cannot reach freeway7 (y=7) from y=5 in one step? We can only go to y=4,5,6 at the next turn.\n\nTherefore, at T=48, we must be at one of y=4,5,6 (if we are in the middle) or we can be at y=0 or y=9 (but we are not at y=0 or 9 at T=48).\n\nBut we see that freeways 4,5,6 are all dangerous at T=48. So we must not be on any of them at T=48.\n\nHow to avoid? We can try to be at y=0 or y=9 at T=48? \n\nBut we start at y=3 at T=45. \n   T=45: y=3\n   T=46: we can go to y=2,3,4\n   T=47: from y=2: can go to y=1,2,3; from y=3: to 2,3,4; from y=4: to 3,4,5\n   T=48: we can be at y=0? Only if we were at y=1 at T=47 and then go down? But y=1 at T=47: then at T=48 we can go to y=0 (by D) or y=1 (by S) or y=2 (by U).\n\nBut y=0 at T=48 is safe (no freeway). Similarly, y=9 at T=48 is safe, but we are at y=1 at T=47 -> we cannot reach y=9 in one step.\n\nSo option: go to y=0 at T=48? \n\nHow to get to y=0 at T=48:\n\nStart: T=45, y=3.\n   T=45: action D? -> T=46: y=2.\n   T=46: action D? -> T=47: y=1.\n   T=47: action D? -> T=48: y=0.\n\nThen at T=48, we are at y=0 -> safe.\n\nThen we can start going up.\n\nBut this will take more turns. \n\nAfter T=48, we are at y=0. Then we need to go up 9 steps? to y=9 -> 9 more turns? Total turns: 3 (to get to y=0) + 9 = 12? But we can avoid some dangers?\n\nBut we have to avoid freeway7 and freeway8 at T=50,51? \n\nWe are at T=48: y=0 -> safe.\n\nThen we plan to go up:\n\nT=48: y=0 -> safe (action U: then T=49: y=1)\nT=49: y=1 -> check freeway1: at T=49: [ -50+3*(49-45)= -50+12=-38, -39+12=-27] -> safe. Then we can go to y=2? \nT=50: we are at y=2? But we are at T=50: freeway2? dangerous at T=50? \n   freeway2: at T=50: [ -47+12*(50-45)= -47+60=13, -36+60=24] -> [13,24] -> no 0 -> safe.\n   Actually, freeway2 dangerous only at T=48. So safe.\n\nBut at T=50 we are at y=2? Then we are safe.\n\nBut wait, we have freeway7 dangerous at T=50 and T=51? But we are at y=2 at T=50 -> freeway2, which is safe.\n\nWe can continue:\n\nT=49: y=1 -> safe -> we can do U: to y=2 at T=50.\nT=50: y=2 -> safe (as above) -> U: to y=3 at T=51.\nT=51: y=3 -> freeway3: at T=51: [ -47+12*(51-45)= -47+72=25, -36+72=36] -> [25,36] -> no 0 -> safe. Then U: to y=4 at T=52.\nT=52: y=4 -> freeway4: [ -47+12*(52-45)= -47+84=37, -36+84=48] -> safe. Then U: to y=5 at T=53.\nT=53: y=5 -> safe? freeway5: same as freeway4: [37,48] -> safe. Then U: to y=6 at T=54.\nT=54: y=6 -> freeway6: two cars.\n   car1: [ -47+12*(54-45)= -47+108=61, -36+108=72] -> [61,72] -> safe.\n   car2: [25+12*(54-45)=25+108=133, 36+108=144] -> safe.\n   Then U: to y=7 at T=55.\nT=55: y=7 -> freeway7: at T=55: \n   car1: [ -41+6*(55-45)= -41+60=19, -30+60=30] -> safe.\n   car2: [7+6*10=7+60=67, 18+60=78] -> safe.\n   Then U: to y=8 at T=56.\nT=56: y=8 -> freeway8: same as freeway7 at T=56: \n   car1: [ -41+6*11= -41+66=25, -30+66=36] -> safe.\n   car2: [7+66=73, 18+66=84] -> safe.\n   Then U: to y=9 at T=57.\n\nSo we reach y=9 at T=57 (absolute) -> relative t=12 (since 45+12=57). So H=13? because we take 13 actions? \n\nWait: from t0 to t12 (13 steps?).\n\nBut note: we start at turn t1=45 (t=0) and we take actions at turns 45,46,...,56 (12 actions) and then at turn 57 we are at y=9? \n\nActually, we take an action at turn T to determine the next state at turn T+1? \n\nBut the update rule: \n   At turn t (absolute), we choose action a_t, then we update to y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo we start at turn45: we are at y_45=3.\nThen we take an action a_45 -> this leads to y_46.\n\nWe want to be at y_{t1+H} = y_{45+H} = 9.\n\nSo H is the number of actions (turns we take actions) and we end at turn 45+H.\n\nIn the above plan:\n\n   Turn45: action D -> y46=2\n   Turn46: action D -> y47=1\n   Turn47: action D -> y48=0\n   Turn48: action U -> y49=1\n   Turn49: action U -> y50=2\n   Turn50: action U -> y51=3\n   Turn51: action U -> y52=4\n   Turn52: action U -> y53=5\n   Turn53: action U -> y54=6\n   Turn54: action U -> y55=7\n   Turn55: action U -> y56=8\n   Turn56: action U -> y57=9\n\nSo we take 12 actions (from turn45 to turn56) and at turn57 we are at 9. So H=12? \n\nBut the problem says: we are to output actions for t=0 to H-1, meaning we take H actions and then at the next turn we are at the goal? \n\nThe problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\".\n\nSo after H actions, we are at (0,9). \n\nIn the above, after 12 actions (at turn56), we set a_56=U, and then at the next state (turn57) we are at y=9.\n\nBut note: we must be at (0,9) at the turn after the last action? \n\nYes: we start at turn t1 (45) and take the first action a_{45} (t=0) and then we have state at turn46. Then we take a_{46} (t=1) ... until the last action a_{t1+H-1} = a_{45+H-1}. Then the next state (at turn t1+H) is the state that must be (0,9).\n\nSo in our plan: \n   We take 12 actions: from a45 to a56 (which is t=0 to t=11) -> then at turn45+12=57, we are at (0,9). So H=12.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nWe note that we avoided T=48 by going down to 0. However, we also have to avoid freeway7 and 8 at T=50,51? But in our path we are not on freeway7 or 8 at T=50,51: at T=50 we are at y=2 (freeway2, safe) and T=51 at y=3 (freeway3, safe).\n\nBut we used 12 turns. We want minimal.\n\nAlternative: instead of going down to 0, we could go up to 9 quickly but avoid the dangerous time at T=48 for freeways 4,5,6 by being at a safe freeway at T=48.\n\nWe saw that freeway1 is safe at T=48. How about we go to y=1 at T=48?\n\nBut we start at y=3 at T=45.\n\nHow to get to y=1 at T=48:\n\n   T45: action D -> T46: y=2\n   T46: action D -> T47: y=1\n   T47: action S (or D? but D would go to y=0) -> we want to stay at y=1 at T48? So S at T47: then at T48, y=1.\n\nAt T48: y=1 -> freeway1: safe (as computed: [-41,-30] at T48).\n\nThen we are at y=1 at T48. Then we can go up.\n\nBut we need to avoid freeway7 and freeway8 at T=50,51? \n\nWe are at T48: y=1.\n\nThen:\n   T48: U -> T49: y=2\n   T49: U -> T50: y=3 -> but at T50: freeway3: safe? \n        freeway3: at T50: [ -47+12*(50-45)= -47+60=13, -36+60=24] -> safe.\n   T50: U -> T51: y=4 -> freeway4: at T51: [ -47+12*6= -47+72=25, -36+72=36] -> safe.\n   T51: U -> T52: y=5 -> safe? freeway5: same as freeway4: [25,36] -> safe.\n   T52: U -> T53: y=6 -> freeway6: \n        car1: [ -47+12*8= -47+96=49, -36+96=60] -> safe.\n        car2: [25+12*8=25+96=121, 36+96=132] -> safe.\n   T53: U -> T54: y=7 -> freeway7: at T54: \n        car1: [ -41+6*9= -41+54=13, -30+54=24] -> safe.\n        car2: [7+6*9=7+54=61, 18+54=72] -> safe.\n   T54: U -> T55: y=8 -> freeway8: same as freeway7 at T55: \n        car1: [ -41+6*10= -41+60=19, -30+60=30] -> safe.\n        car2: [7+60=67, 18+60=78] -> safe.\n   T55: U -> T56: y=9.\n\nSo we reach at T56: y=9? \n\nBut we started at T45: \n   T45: D -> T46: y=2\n   T46: D -> T47: y=1\n   T47: S -> T48: y=1\n   T48: U -> T49: y=2\n   T49: U -> T50: y=3\n   T50: U -> T51: y=4\n   T51: U -> T52: y=5\n   T52: U -> T53: y=6\n   T53: U -> T54: y=7\n   T54: U -> T55: y=8\n   T55: U -> T56: y=9\n\nSo we take 11 actions: from T45 to T55 (11 actions) and then at T56 we are at y=9. So H=11.\n\nIs that minimal? We started at y=3 and need to go to y=9: minimum 6 steps. But we took 11? \n\nBut we avoided the dangerous T=48 by going down to y=1 at T48, and then we went up without encountering any danger.\n\nNow, compare to the first plan (12 actions), this is better.\n\nBut we have freeway7 and freeway8 dangerous at T=50,51? In this plan:\n\n   At T50: we are at y=3 -> freeway3: safe.\n   At T51: we are at y=4 -> freeway4: safe.\n\nSo we avoided them.\n\nBut what about freeway1 at T=58 to 61? We are at y=1 at T48, then we leave and we don't come back to freeway1 until after T48? We are at freeway1 only at T48? and then we move to y=2 at T49 -> freeway2, then freeway3, etc. So we are never at freeway1 again. So we avoid the later danger.\n\nTherefore, this plan with H=11 is valid.\n\nBut can we do better? \n\nWe note that we spent 3 actions to go from y=3 to y=1 (at T48): two downs and one stay? Actually, we did two downs and then a stay? \n\nBut we could do two downs: \n   T45: D -> T46: y=2\n   T46: D -> T47: y=1\n   Then T47: we are at T47, and we want to be at y=1 at T48? So we must choose an action at T47 that leaves us at y=1 at T48: which is S (stay). \n\nAlternatively, we could do:\n   T45: D -> T46: y=2\n   T46: S -> T47: y=2\n   T47: D -> T48: y=1\n\nThat also works. Then we are at y=1 at T48.\n\nBut then:\n   T48: U -> T49: y=2\n   T49: U -> T50: y=3\n   ... same as above -> still 11 actions? \n\nBut we did the same: 3 actions to get to y=1 at T48.\n\nIs there a way to avoid the dangerous T=48 without spending 3 actions? \n\nWe could go up to y=7 at T48? But we cannot because we are blocked by the dangerous freeways 4,5,6 at T48. \n\nAlternatively, we could go to y=9 earlier? \n\nBut note: to go from y=3 to y=9 we need at least 6 U moves. The minimal number of turns is 6, but we have to avoid the obstacles.\n\nWe tried the straight path and it failed at T48 (step3) because we were at y=6 at T48.\n\nWe could wait at a safe freeway above? But at T47 we are at y=5 (if we went up twice: T45:U->4, T46:U->5). Then at T47 we are at y=5. We cannot go to y=6 at T48 (dangerous) and we cannot stay at y=5 (dangerous at T48) and we cannot go down to y=4 (dangerous at T48). So we must leave the freeways 4,5,6? \n\nBut we can go up to y=7? from y=5 at T47? That would require two U moves? But we can only move one per turn. So at T47: we are at y=5, then we can only go to y=4,5,6 at T48. All of which are dangerous.\n\nSo we must go down to y=0 or to y=1? \n\nWe already did the path to y=1 at T48 and then up: 11 turns.\n\nBut we note that we can go to y=0 at T48? \n\n   T45: D -> T46: y=2\n   T46: D -> T47: y=1\n   T47: D -> T48: y=0\n\nThen at T48: safe. Then we go up:\n\n   T48: U -> T49: y=1 -> freeway1: at T49: [-50+3*4=-50+12=-38, -39+12=-27] -> safe.\n   T49: U -> T50: y=2 -> freeway2: at T50: [-47+12*5=-47+60=13, -36+60=24] -> safe.\n   T50: U -> T51: y=3 -> freeway3: [ -47+12*6= -47+72=25, -36+72=36] -> safe.\n   ... then same as before until y=9 at T56? \n\nBut then we have:\n\n   T45: D\n   T46: D\n   T47: D\n   T48: U\n   T49: U\n   T50: U\n   T51: U\n   T52: U\n   T53: U\n   T54: U\n   T55: U -> y=9 at T56.\n\nThat is 11 actions? Same as the previous one? \n\nBut wait: we did 3 downs and 8 ups? 3+8=11 actions. But from y=0 to y=9: we need 9 U moves? \n\nMistake: \n   Start: T45: y=3.\n   T45: D -> y=2 at T46\n   T46: D -> y=1 at T47\n   T47: D -> y=0 at T48\n   T48: U -> y=1 at T49\n   T49: U -> y=2 at T50\n   T50: U -> y=3 at T51\n   T51: U -> y=4 at T52\n   T52: U -> y=5 at T53\n   T53: U -> y=6 at T54\n   T54: U -> y=7 at T55\n   T55: U -> y=8 at T56\n   T56: U -> y=9 at T57.\n\nSo that is 12 actions: from T45 to T56, and at T57 we are at y=9. So H=12.\n\nTherefore, the path that goes to y=0 is 12 actions, while the path that goes to y=1 and stays at T47 is 11 actions.\n\nSo the 11-action plan is better.\n\nBut in the 11-action plan, we did:\n\n   T45: D -> T46: y=2\n   T46: D -> T47: y=1\n   T47: S -> T48: y=1   (safe at T48: freeway1 is safe)\n   T48: U -> T49: y=2\n   T49: U -> T50: y=3\n   T50: U -> T51: y=4\n   T51: U -> T52: y=5\n   T52: U -> T53: y=6\n   T53: U -> T54: y=7\n   T54: U -> T55: y=8\n   T55: U -> T56: y=9\n\nSo 11 actions: from T45 to T55, and at T56 we are at y=9. So H=11.\n\nBut note: we have to check freeway1 at T48: we did: [-41,-30] -> safe.\n\nNow, is there a 10-action plan? \n\nWe start at y=3 at T45. We need to get to y=9 at T45+10 = T55.\n\nWe must avoid the dangerous T=48 (relative t=3) and T=50,51 (relative t=5,6).\n\nThe minimal moves without obstacles is 6. But we have to avoid the obstacles by waiting or detouring.\n\nWe note that we spent 3 actions to get from y=3 to y=1 at T48. Then we have 7 actions to go from y=1 to y=9: which takes 8 steps? Because 8 ups: 1->2->3->...->9: 8 moves. So total moves: 3+8=11.\n\nBut if we can get to a safe freeway at T48 without going down so much? \n\nWe could go up to y=7 or y=8 at T48? But we cannot because we are blocked by the dangerous freeways 4,5,6 at T48.\n\nAlternatively, we could go to y=9 earlier? \n\nBut we have to pass through freeways 4,5,6,7,8. And freeway4,5,6 are dangerous at T48. So we must not be on them at T48.\n\nWhat if we are at y=9 at T48? Then we are safe. How many moves: from y=3 to y=9: 6 moves. So we would need to do 6 U moves in 3 turns? But we can only do one per turn. So impossible: at T48 we can only have taken 3 actions: \n   T45: U -> y=4\n   T46: U -> y=5\n   T47: U -> y=6\n   Then at T48 we are at y=6 -> which is dangerous. \n\nIf we do U,U,U we end at y=6 at T48 -> crash.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=9 at T48.\n\nWhat if we are at y=7 at T48? Then we are on freeway7 -> which is safe at T48. How to get to y=7 at T48:\n\n   T45: U -> T46: y=4\n   T46: U -> T47: y=5\n   T47: U -> T48: y=6 -> but that is dangerous? \n   Alternatively: we need to do more than one U per turn? No.\n\nBut we can do: \n   T45: U -> y=4\n   T46: U -> y=5\n   T47: we want to go to y=7? We can only go to y=4,5,6.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nTherefore, we must be below freeway4 at T48? Or at freeway1 (y=1) or freeway7 (y=7) or freeway8 (y=8). But we cannot get to freeway7 or 8 in 3 moves from y=3: maximum we can get to y=6.\n\nSo the only safe freeways at T48 are y=1 and y=7,8? But we can only get to y=1 in 3 moves (by going down) or to y=7,8? we cannot.\n\nWe already have a path of 11. \n\nBut note: we could avoid the stay at T47? \n\nIn the 11-action plan, we did at T47: S. But if we do D at T47 we go to y=0 at T48, which we saw leads to 12 actions. \n\nAlternatively, we could go to y=9 in 10 actions? \n\nWe note that we are at y=1 at T48. Then we need 8 more moves to go to y=9: that would be at T56 (if we start from T48: 8 actions). So total from T45: 3 (to get to T48) + 8 = 11.\n\nBut what if we can skip some moves? \n\nWe are at y=1 at T48. Then we do:\n\n   T48: U -> T49: y=2\n   T49: U -> T50: y=3\n   T50: U -> T51: y=4\n   T51: U -> T52: y=5\n   T52: U -> T53: y=6\n   T53: U -> T54: y=7\n   T54: U -> T55: y=8\n   T55: U -> T56: y=9 -> 8 moves from T48 to T55? \n\nBut we want to be at y=9 at T55? That is, after 10 actions? \n\nThe actions: \n   T45: D\n   T46: D\n   T47: S\n   T48: U\n   T49: U\n   T50: U\n   T51: U\n   T52: U\n   T53: U\n   T54: U -> then at T55: y=9? \n\nWait, let me count:\n\n   T45: D -> T46: y=2\n   T46: D -> T47: y=1\n   T47: S -> T48: y=1\n   T48: U -> T49: y=2\n   T49: U -> T50: y=3\n   T50: U -> T51: y=4\n   T51: U -> T52: y=5\n   T52: U -> T53: y=6\n   T53: U -> T54: y=7\n   T54: U -> T55: y=8  -> we are at y=8 at T55, not 9.\n\nWe need one more U to get to 9: T55: U -> T56: y=9. So that is 11 actions.\n\nTherefore, we cannot do 10.\n\nSo the minimal H is 11.\n\nBut we must check if there is a path that uses 10 actions? \n\nSuppose we try to go up as much as possible and avoid by timing:\n\nWe start at T45: y=3.\n\nWe do:\n   T45: U -> T46: y=4\n   T46: U -> T47: y=5\n\nNow at T47: y=5. We cannot go to y=6 at T48 (dangerous) and we cannot stay at y=5 (dangerous) and we cannot go down to y=4 (dangerous). So we must go to a freeway that is safe? But we are constrained to y=4,5,6 at T48. So we have to crash.\n\nAlternatively, at T46 we do not go to y=5? \n\n   T45: U -> T46: y=4\n   T46: S -> T47: y=4\n\nThen at T47: y=4. Then at T48: we can go to y=3,4,5. But all are dangerous at T48.\n\n   T46: D -> T47: y=3 -> then at T48: we can go to y=2,3,4 -> but y=3 and y=4 are dangerous, so we can go to y=2? which is dangerous at T48? freeway2: dangerous at T48 -> crash.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\nWe output the 11-action plan.\n\nThe sequence:\n\n   Turn 45: D\n   Turn 46: D\n   Turn 47: S\n   Turn 48: U\n   Turn 49: U\n   Turn 50: U\n   Turn 51: U\n   Turn 52: U\n   Turn 53: U\n   Turn 54: U\n   Turn 55: U\n\nBut wait: at T55 we are at y=8? Then we do U at T55 to get to y=9 at T56? But we have taken 11 actions: from T45 to T55. Then at T56 we are at y=9.\n\nBut the problem: we must be at (0,9) at the state after the last action. So the last action is at T55, and then at T56 we are at y=9.\n\nSo that is correct.\n\nBut note: the problem says the sequence is for t=0 to H-1: so we output 11 actions.\n\nIn the plan above, we have:\n\n   Turn45: D\n   Turn46: D\n   Turn47: S\n   Turn48: U\n   Turn49: U\n   Turn50: U\n   Turn51: U\n   Turn52: U\n   Turn53: U\n   Turn54: U\n   Turn55: U\n\nBut at the end of Turn55 action (U), we go from y=8 (at T55) to y=9 (at T56). So we are at (0,9) at T56.\n\nBut we must ensure that at T56 we are at (0,9) and that we do not have to check collision at T56? We are at y=9 -> no freeway -> safe.\n\nSo the plan is valid.\n\nBut we must check every step for collision? \n\nLet me verify step by step:\n\n   T45: y=3 -> freeway3: at T45: [-47,-36] -> safe. Action: D -> next state: y=2 at T46.\n   T46: y=2 -> freeway2: at T46: [ -47+12*1 = -35, -36+12*1=-24] -> safe. Action: D -> y=1 at T47.\n   T47: y=1 -> freeway1: at T47: [ -50+3*2 = -50+6=-44, -39+6=-33] -> safe. Action: S -> y=1 at T48.\n   T48: y=1 -> freeway1: at T48: [ -50+3*3=-50+9=-41, -39+9=-30] -> safe. Action: U -> y=2 at T49.\n   T49: y=2 -> freeway2: at T49: [ -47+12*4? Wait, absolute T49=45+4=49? \n        Actually, T=49: [ -47+12*(49-45)= -47+12*4=-47+48=1, -36+48=12] -> [1,12] -> no 0 -> safe.

The goal is to reach (0, 9) with the minimal number of turns H, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollisions happen only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The span changes over time based on direction and speed.\n\nImportant: When the player moves to a new y at turn T, they are not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, they are on y_T, and if they move, at turn T+1 they are on y_{T+1}. So for collision at turn T, it depends on y_T and the cars on that freeway at turn T.\n\nAlso, cars are moving: left-moving or right-moving. In the car state, direction is given: \"right\" means right-moving, so for right-moving cars, the span increases as time goes on.\n\nLet me list all the cars per freeway at turn t1=48.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nSince it's right-moving, direction right, so head is at -48, tail at -59? That seems odd because usually head is the front, but for right-moving, if it's moving right, head should be greater than tail.\n\nThe car update: for right-moving, span at T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)], and it says \"head h, tail τ\", but in the table, for freeway 1, it's (-48, -59, right, 3). Since direction is right, and head is -48, tail is -59, but -48 > -59, so head is at higher x, which makes sense for right-moving: head at -48, tail at -59, so as it moves right, x increases.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nLet me denote the cars clearly.\n\nAt turn t1=48:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head h = -48, tail τ = -59, direction d = right, speed s = 3.\n\nSince d=right, the car is moving right. So at time T, position is [τ + s(T-48), h + s(T-48)] = [-59 + 3(T-48), -48 + 3(T-48)]\n\nFreeway 2: one car: (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nh=48, τ=37, d=right, s=12. But 48 > 37, so head at 48, tail at 37, moving right. So span at T: [37 + 12(T-48), 48 + 12(T-48)]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2: (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 4: same: (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 5: same: (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 6: two cars: (48, 37, right, 12) and (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: same as above, h=48, τ=37, d=right, s=12\n\nSecond car: h=0, τ=-11, d=right, s=12, so span at T: [-11 + 12(T-48), 0 + 12(T-48)]\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (-48, -59, right, 6) and (0, -11, right, 6)\n\nFirst car: h=-48, τ=-59, d=right, s=6, span at T: [-59 + 6(T-48), -48 + 6(T-48)]\n\nSecond car: h=0, τ=-11, d=right, s=6, span at T: [-11 + 6(T-48), 0 + 6(T-48)]\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7: (-48, -59, right, 6) and (0, -11, right, 6)\n\nNow, the player starts at y=0 at turn 48. y=0 is not a freeway with cars, so no collision there. Freeways are from y=1 to y=8.\n\nGoal is to reach y=9, which is also not a freeway, so once at y=9, no cars to worry about.\n\nBut to reach y=9, the player needs to pass through y=1 to 8, and at each turn, when on a freeway, avoid collision.\n\nPlayer must end at (0,9), so at some turn T, y_T =9.\n\nNow, since player starts at y=0, and y=9 is up, probably need to move up mostly, but might need to go down sometimes to avoid cars.\n\nMinimal H, so we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoiding collisions.\n\nFirst, let's find when collisions happen for each freeway at different times.\n\nThe critical point is when 0 is in the car's span at a given turn.\n\nFor each freeway, for each car, we can find the time intervals when 0 is in the span.\n\nSince the player moves one y per turn, and we care about the time when player is on that y.\n\nLet me define the time relative to t1=48. Set t=0 at turn 48 for simplicity. So current turn is t=0.\n\nAt turn t=0 (absolute turn 48), player at y=0.\n\nWe need to find actions from t=0 to t=H-1, so at turn t, action a_t determines y_{t+1}, I think? Let's see the update.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nAt turn t, action a_t is applied, so y_{t+1} is set based on a_t.\n\nAnd collision at turn T depends on y_T.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t, we have action a_t, which affects y_{t+1}.\n\nBut for collision at turn T, it depends on y_T, which is the position at that turn.\n\nNow, at turn T, the player is on y_T, and we check if there is a car on freeway y_T such that 0 is in span at turn T.\n\nNow, for freeway k, the cars are fixed, but their positions change over time.\n\nLet's find for each freeway and each car, when 0 is covered, i.e., when min_span <= 0 <= max_span.\n\nThen for a given turn T, on freeway k, if any car has 0 in span at T, then collision if player is there.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nPlayer starts at t=0, y=0, which is safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince we want minimal H, probably we want to go up as much as possible, but need to avoid being on a bad freeway at bad times.\n\ny from 0 to 9, so we need to increase y by 9. With U actions, it takes at least 9 turns, but we might have to stay or go down to avoid, so H could be more than 9.\n\nBut with S or D, it takes longer, so to minimize H, we should use U as much as possible, only S or D when necessary to avoid.\n\nNow, let's analyze each freeway.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car, right-moving, s=3, span at time t (relative to t=0, so T = 48 + t, but since t1=48, at time t, absolute turn is 48 + t.\n\nDefine t as turns after start, so at time t (t=0,1,2,...), absolute turn is 48 + t.\n\nCar span at time t (since t1=48, T-t1 = t)\n\nFor freeway 1 car: [τ + s t, h + s t] with τ=-59, h=-48, s=3\n\nSo span: [-59 + 3t, -48 + 3t]\n\n0 in span when -59 + 3t <= 0 <= -48 + 3t\n\nWhich is: -59 + 3t <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 3t\n\nSo 3t <= 59 => t <= 59/3 = 19.666, so t <= 19 since t integer? t is turn, integer.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= -48 + 3t => 48 <= 3t => t >= 16\n\nAlso, -59 + 3t <= 0 => t <= 59/3 = 19 + 2/3, so since t integer, t <= 19\n\n0 <= -48 + 3t => 3t >= 48 => t >= 16\n\nSo for t from 16 to 19 inclusive, 0 in span.\n\nt=16,17,18,19.\n\nAt t=16: min = -59 + 3*16 = -59 + 48 = -11, max = -48 + 48 = 0, so [ -11, 0], 0 is included.\n\nt=17: min=-59+51=-8, max=-48+51=3, [ -8,3], 0 in\n\nt=18: min=-59+54=-5, max=-48+54=6, [-5,6], 0 in\n\nt=19: min=-59+57=-2, max=-48+57=9, [-2,9], 0 in\n\nt=20: min=-59+60=1, max=-48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nt=15: min=-59+45=-14, max=-48+45=-3, [-14,-3], 0 not in\n\nSo freeway 1 unsafe at t=16,17,18,19\n\nNow freeway 2: one car, h=48, τ=37, d=right, s=12\n\nSpan: [τ + s t, h + s t] = [37 + 12t, 48 + 12t]\n\n0 in span: 37 + 12t <= 0 <= 48 + 12t\n\nBut 37 + 12t <=0? 12t <= -37, impossible since t>=0.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= 48 + 12t always true for t>=0.\n\nBut 37 + 12t <=0 only if t negative, but t>=0, so 37+12t >=37>0, so min >0, so 0 never in span.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 3,4,5: same car, all have min=37+12t >0 for t>=0, so always safe? But we need to check.\n\n0 in span only if min <=0 and max>=0.\n\nHere min=37+12t >=37>0, so min>0, thus 0 not <= min, so not in span. So freeway 2,3,4,5 are always safe, no car covers 0 at any time.\n\nIs that right? Freeway 2 car: at t=0, span [37,48], both positive, so 0 not covered. As time increases, span moves right, so always positive, never covers 0. Similarly for 3,4,5.\n\nNow freeway 6: two cars.\n\nFirst car: same as above, (48,37,right,12), which we just said never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12), h=0, τ=-11, d=right, s=12\n\nSpan: [τ + s t, h + s t] = [-11 + 12t, 0 + 12t]\n\n0 in span: -11 + 12t <= 0 <= 12t\n\n0 <= 12t always for t>=0.\n\n-11 + 12t <= 0 => 12t <=11 => t <= 11/12 <1, so for t=0: -11 +0 = -11 <=0, and 0<=0, so yes, 0 in span at t=0.\n\nt=0: min=-11, max=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 included.\n\nt=1: min=-11+12=1, max=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nt=0: 0 in span.\n\nFor t>0, min= -11+12t, for t=0, min=-11, max=0\n\nt=1, min=1, max=12\n\nSo 0 in span only at t=0? -11 +12t <=0 and 0<=12t\n\n-11+12t <=0 => t <= 11/12, so only t=0 since t integer >=0.\n\nAt t=0, -11 <=0 and 0<=0, yes.\n\nAt t=1, min=1>0, so not.\n\nBut t=0 is the starting turn, absolute 48.\n\nNow, freeway 6 has two cars, but first car never covers 0, second covers 0 only at t=0.\n\nSo at time t, on freeway 6, unsafe if t=0.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,6), h=-48, τ=-59, s=6\n\nSpan: [τ + s t, h + s t] = [-59 +6t, -48 +6t]\n\n0 in span: -59+6t <=0 <= -48+6t\n\nSo -59+6t <=0 => 6t <=59 => t <= 59/6=9.833, t<=9\n\n0 <= -48+6t => 48 <=6t => t>=8\n\nAlso -59+6t <=0 => t <= 59/6=9 +5/6, so t<=9\n\n0 <= -48+6t => 6t >=48 => t>=8\n\nSo for t=8,9\n\nt=8: min=-59+48= -11, max=-48+48=0, [-11,0], 0 in\n\nt=9: min=-59+54= -5, max=-48+54=6, [-5,6], 0 in\n\nt=10: min=-59+60=1, max=-48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nNow second car on freeway 7: (0,-11,right,6), h=0, τ=-11, s=6\n\nSpan: [-11 +6t, 0 +6t]\n\n0 in span: -11+6t <=0 <=6t\n\n0<=6t always for t>=0\n\n-11+6t <=0 => 6t <=11 => t <= 11/6=1.833, so t<=1\n\nt=0: min=-11<=0, max=0, 0 in\n\nt=1: min=-11+6= -5, max=6, [-5,6], 0 in\n\nt=2: min=-11+12=1, max=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo for second car, 0 in span at t=0 and t=1.\n\nNow freeway 7 has both cars, so unsafe if either car covers 0.\n\nAt t=0: both cars cover 0? First car at t=0: min=-59, max=-48, both negative, so [ -59,-48], 0 not in, since min=-59<0 but max=-48<0, so 0 not in span.\n\nt=0: for first car, span [-59,-48], all negative, so 0 not <= max? max=-48<0, so 0 > max, not in span.\n\nSecond car at t=0: [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nSo at t=0, freeway 7 unsafe because of second car.\n\nSimilarly, at t=1: first car span: min=-59+6= -53, max=-48+6= -42, [-53,-42], all negative, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: min=-11+6= -5, max=6, [-5,6], 0 in, so unsafe.\n\nt=2: first car min=-59+12= -47, max=-48+12= -36, all negative, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car min=1, max=12, 0 not in. Safe.\n\n...\n\nUntil t=8: first car min=-59+48= -11, max=-48+48=0, [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nSecond car at t=8: min=-11+48=37, max=48, [37,48], 0 not in. So unsafe because of first car.\n\nt=9: first car min=-59+54= -5, max=-48+54=6, [-5,6], 0 in; second car min=-11+54=43, max=48? Wait no, h + s t = 0 + 6*9=54? Wait.\n\ns=6, t=9, second car: τ + s t = -11 + 54 = 43? -11 + 6*9 = -11 + 54 = 43, h + s t = 0 + 54 = 54, so [43,54], min=43, max=54, both >0, 0 not in. So only first car covers 0 at t=9.\n\nSo freeway 7 unsafe at: t=0 (second car), t=1 (second car), t=8 (first car), t=9 (first car)\n\nFrom above:\n\nt=0: unsafe (second car)\n\nt=1: unsafe (second car)\n\nt=8: unsafe (first car)\n\nt=9: unsafe (first car)\n\nAnd other times safe.\n\nNow freeway 8: same as freeway 7, since same cars: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nSo identical to freeway 7, unsafe at t=0,1,8,9.\n\nNow freeway 6: we have, unsafe only at t=0 because of the second car (0,-11,right,12) at t=0.\n\nAt t=0, span [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nFreeways 2,3,4,5 always safe.\n\nFreeway 1 unsafe at t=16,17,18,19.\n\nNow, player starts at t=0, y=0.\n\ny=0 is not a freeway, so safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe path must go through y=1 to 8 at some points.\n\nSince we want minimal H, we should try to go up directly if possible.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on a freeway when it is unsafe for that freeway.\n\nLet me list the unsafe times for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe t=16,17,18,19\n\nFreeway 2: always safe\n\nFreeway 3: always safe\n\nFreeway 4: always safe\n\nFreeway 5: always safe\n\nFreeway 6: unsafe only at t=0\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe at t=0,1,8,9\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at t=0,1,8,9\n\nt=0 is the current turn, but at t=0, player is at y=0, not on any freeway, so for freeway 6,7,8 unsafe at t=0, but since player not there, it doesn't matter for collision. Collision only if player is on the freeway at that turn.\n\nAt turn t, if player on freeway k, and k is unsafe at t, then collision.\n\nIf not on freeway, or on safe freeway at that time, ok.\n\nNow, player starts at t=0, y=0.\n\nAction a_t at turn t affects y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, after action, position is y_{t+1} for the next state, but collision is checked at turn t based on y_t.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t (absolute 48+t), player is at position y_t.\n\nThen, action a_t is taken, which determines Δy_t, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, player is at y_{t+1}, and collision check based on that.\n\nIn collision rule: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nSo at turn T, player on y_T, and we check cars on freeway y_T at that turn.\n\nFor the sequence, at each turn t, we have y_t, and action a_t.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, and at turn t=H-1, y_{H-1} should be 9? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, with H actions, so after H actions, at turn t1+H, position should be (0,9).\n\nSet t=0 for relative turn.\n\nAt relative turn t=0: position y_0 = 0\n\nAfter action a_0, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{k}, y_{k+1} = y_k + Δy_k\n\nWe want at some turn, say at turn T, y_T = 9.\n\nSince actions start at t=0, and after H actions, we have y_H.\n\nThe sequence has actions from t=0 to t=H-1, so after H actions, we have y_H.\n\nWe want y_H = 9.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t, for t=0 to H.\n\nAt turn t, collision depends on y_t.\n\nFor t=0, y_0=0, not freeway, safe.\n\nWe need to set actions such that for all t from 1 to H-1, when y_t between 1 and 8, no collision at that turn, and y_H=9.\n\ny_t for t=1 to H, since at turn t, position y_t.\n\nWhen y_H=9, it's not freeway, so no issue.\n\nNow, y_t must be integer from 0 to 9.\n\nStart y_0=0.\n\nEnd y_H=9.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0,+1.\n\nMinimal H to go from 0 to 9 with min steps is 9 U actions, but might need detours.\n\nH is the number of turns from start to end, so from t=0 to t=H, with H actions.\n\ny_0=0, after H actions, y_H=9.\n\nThe number of steps: to increase y by 9, with only U, H=9, y_9=9.\n\nWith S or D, it takes more turns.\n\nTo minimize H, we should avoid S and D as much as possible.\n\nBut we need to avoid collisions when on freeways 1-8 at times when unsafe.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway the unsafe times:\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe t=16,17,18,19\n\nFreeway 2: always safe\n\nFreeway 3: always safe\n\nFreeway 4: always safe\n\nFreeway 5: always safe\n\nFreeway 6: unsafe only at t=0\n\nBut t=0 is the starting turn, and at t=0, player is at y=0, not on freeway 6, so for freeway 6, since unsafe only at t=0, and at that time no one is on it for collision? The unsafe time is only at t=0, but at t=0, if player were on freeway 6, it would be collision, but since player starts at y=0, not on 6, so for later times, freeway 6 is safe for all t>0, since only unsafe at t=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: unsafe at t=0,1,8,9\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at t=0,1,8,9\n\nNow, freeway 6: unsafe only at t=0, so for t>=1, it is safe.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 unsafe at t=0,1,8,9.\n\nt=0 and t=1 are early, t=8,9 are later.\n\nPlayer needs to go through y=1 to 8.\n\nSince freeway 2,3,4,5 are always safe, we can be on them at any time.\n\nFreeway 1 unsafe at t=16-19, which is later.\n\nFreeway 6 safe for t>=1\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 unsafe at t=0,1,8,9, but safe at other times.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 quickly, we should go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut at the beginning, freeway 7 and 8 are unsafe at t=0 and t=1.\n\nAt t=0, player at y=0, safe.\n\nNow, action at t=0: if we do U, then at t=1, y=1, which is freeway 1.\n\nBut freeway 1 at t=1: is it unsafe? Freeway 1 unsafe only at t=16-19, so at t=1, it should be safe.\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe only t=16-19, so at t=1, safe.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=1 at t=1, freeway 1 is safe.\n\nBut we might want to go higher.\n\nAction at t=0: we can choose U, D, or S.\n\nIf U, y1 =1\n\nIf S, y1=0\n\nIf D, y1=0, but y=0, min y, cannot go below, so if a_t=D at y=0, y_{t+1} = max(0, y_t -1) =0, so stay at 0.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, if U, stay at 9.\n\nBut here y=0, so D or S both keep y=0.\n\nBut to go up, we should U.\n\nBut let's see the early freeways.\n\nFreeway 6 is at y=6, unsafe only at t=0, so if we go to y=6 at t>=1, safe.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 are y=7 and 8, unsafe at t=0,1,8,9.\n\nSo if we go to y=7 or 8 at t=0 or t=1 or t=8 or t=9, collision.\n\nOther times safe.\n\nNow, since player starts at y=0, t=0, cannot be at y=7 or 8 at t=0, so only avoid at t=1,8,9 for y=7 or 8.\n\nSimilarly, for y=6, no issue after t=0.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 in minimal time, with 9 U, we can be at y=9 at t=9 if all U.\n\nBut at t=9, if we are on freeway 8 or something.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nAssume we go all U from start.\n\nAt t=0: y0=0, action a0=U, so y1=1\n\nTurn t=1: y1=1, which is freeway 1. Freeway 1 at t=1: unsafe? No, unsafe only t=16-19, t=1 safe. So no collision.\n\nAction a1=U, y2=2\n\nt=2: y2=2, freeway 2, always safe, no collision.\n\na2=U, y3=3, freeway 3, safe.\n\na3=U, y4=4, freeway 4, safe.\n\na4=U, y5=5, freeway 5, safe.\n\na5=U, y6=6, freeway 6.\n\nNow freeway 6 at t=6: unsafe only at t=0, so t=6>0, safe. No collision.\n\na6=U, y7=7, freeway 7.\n\nNow t=7, freeway 7 at t=7: unsafe times t=0,1,8,9. t=7 not in, so safe? Earlier we have unsafe at t=0,1,8,9. t=7 not unsafe, so should be safe.\n\nBut let's confirm.\n\nFreeway 7 at t=7: first car: span min=-59+6*7=-59+42=-17, max=-48+42=-6, [-17,-6], all negative, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: min=-11+42=31, max=42? s=6, t=7, τ + s t = -11 +42=31, h + s t=0+42=42, [31,42], 0 not in. So yes, safe.\n\nAction a6=U, so at t=7, y7=7.\n\nThen a7=U, y8=8, freeway 8 at t=8.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe at t=8? Yes, t=8 is unsafe for freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 same as 7, unsafe at t=0,1,8,9.\n\nAt t=8, unsafe, so if player on y=8 at t=8, collision.\n\nIn this path, at t=8, y8=8, which is freeway 8, and t=8 unsafe, so collision, not allowed.\n\nThen we cannot go directly.\n\nAt t=7, y7=7, we could do S or D instead of U.\n\nBut we want to reach fast.\n\nSince t=8 is unsafe for y=8, we should not be on y=8 at t=8.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at t=8 might be ok, but let's see.\n\nIn the all U path, we have problem at t=8 when going to y=8.\n\nt=8 is absolute turn 48+8=56, but relative t=8.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=8 at t=8 or on y=7 at t=8? Freeway 7 unsafe at t=8, so if on y=7 at t=8, collision.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at t=8 collision.\n\nNow, in the sequence, at turn t=7, we are at y7=7 (if we went up), then action a7.\n\nIf we do U, y8=8, but at t=8, y8=8, unsafe.\n\nIf we do S, y8=7, still on freeway 7, and at t=8, freeway 7 unsafe, so collision.\n\nIf we do D, y8=6, freeway 6, which is safe at t=8, since unsafe only t=0.\n\nFreeway 6 safe for t>=1.\n\nSo at t=7, y7=7, if we do D, then y8=6, freeway 6 at t=8, safe.\n\nThen we are at y=6 at t=8.\n\nBut we need to go to y=9.\n\nFrom there, we can go up again.\n\nBut it will take extra turns.\n\nWe could delay the ascent or something.\n\nSince freeways 2-5 are always safe, we could stay on them for a while.\n\nBut to minimize time, we should not stay, but go up.\n\nAnother idea: since t=8 and t=9 are unsafe for y=7 and y=8, we should avoid being on y=7 or 8 at t=8 or t=9.\n\nSimilarly, at t=0 and t=1, but we start from low, so not issue for high y.\n\nNow, in the direct path, we reach y=7 at t=7.\n\nt=7 is safe for y=7, as above.\n\nThen at t=7, instead of going up, we need to go down or stay, but stay at t=8 would be on y=7 at t=8, unsafe.\n\nGo down to y=6 at t=8.\n\nThen from y=6, we can go up to y=7 at later time.\n\nBut when to go up.\n\nt=8 and t=9 unsafe for y=7 and 8.\n\nt=10 might be safe.\n\nFreeway 7 unsafe at t=8,9, so at t=10, safe.\n\nSimilarly freeway 8 at t=10 safe.\n\nIn the all U plan, we were at:\n\nt=0: y=0\n\nt=1: y=1\n\nt=2: y=2\n\nt=3: y=3\n\nt=4: y=4\n\nt=5: y=5\n\nt=6: y=6\n\nt=7: y=7\n\nNow at t=7, if we do D, then y8=6 (freeway 6, safe at t=8)\n\nThen at t=8, y=6, action a8: we can do U, to y9=7 at t=9.\n\nBut at t=9, y9=7, freeway 7, and t=9 unsafe for freeway 7, so collision.\n\nIf at t=8, y=6, we do S, then y9=6, still freeway 6, safe, but not progressing.\n\nOr do D to y=5, but worse.\n\nTo avoid collision at t=9 on y=7, we cannot be on y=7 at t=9.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=7 at t=10, should be safe.\n\nBut at t=8, we are at y=6.\n\nAt t=8, y=6, we can do S, so y9=6 at t=9.\n\nThen at t=9, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=9, we can do U to y10=7 at t=10.\n\nt=10, freeway 7: unsafe times t=0,1,8,9. t=10 not in, so safe.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nSimilarly, to y=8 and y=9.\n\nNow, let's list the positions:\n\nStart t=0: y=0\n\na0=U: y1=1 at t=1 (safe)\n\na1=U: y2=2 at t=2 (safe)\n\na2=U: y3=3 at t=3 (safe)\n\na3=U: y4=4 at t=4 (safe)\n\na4=U: y5=5 at t=5 (safe)\n\na5=U: y6=6 at t=6 (safe)\n\na6=U: y7=7 at t=7 (safe, as before)\n\nNow at t=7, y=7, we need to avoid being on y=7 or 8 at t=8 or t=9.\n\nSo action a7: instead of U, do D, so y8=6 at t=8 (freeway 6, safe)\n\nNow t=8: y=6, we need to go up, but if we do U, y9=7 at t=9, but t=9 y=7 unsafe.\n\nSo do S at t=8: a8=S, so y9=6 at t=9 (still freeway 6, safe)\n\nThen at t=9, y=6, action a9=U, so y10=7 at t=10 (freeway 7, t=10 safe)\n\nThen a10=U, y11=8 at t=11 (freeway 8, now t=11, unsafe times t=0,1,8,9, t=11 not in, so safe)\n\nThen a11=U, y12=9 at t=12\n\nNow at t=12, y=9, not freeway, safe, and we reached.\n\nH=12, with y12=9.\n\nBut is this minimal? We used one extra S and one extra step by going down and up.\n\nH=12 turns from start, with 12 actions? Let's count.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=11, 12 actions, y from 0 to 12, y12=9.\n\nt from 0 to 11, 12 steps? Turns: at turn t=0, position before action? No.\n\nAt turn t=0: position y0=0, action a0\n\nAfter a0, y1\n\nTurn t=1: position y1, action a1\n\n...\n\nTurn t=k: position y_k, action a_k\n\nAfter a_{H-1}, y_H =9.\n\nIn this case, y0=0, after 12 actions, y12=9.\n\nThe sequence: actions a0 to a11.\n\na0:U to y1=1\n\na1:U to y2=2\n\na2:U to y3=3\n\na3:U to y4=4\n\na4:U to y5=5\n\na5:U to y6=6\n\na6:U to y7=7\n\na7:D to y8=6  (down to avoid)\n\na8:S to y9=6  (stay to wait)\n\na9:U to y10=7\n\na10:U to y11=8\n\na11:U to y12=9\n\nNow, collisions: at t=1 to t=6: all safe as before.\n\nt=7: y7=7, freeway 7, t=7 not unsafe, safe.\n\nt=8: y8=6, freeway 6, safe (t=8>0)\n\nt=9: y9=6, freeway 6, safe\n\nt=10: y10=7, freeway 7, t=10 not in {0,1,8,9}, safe\n\nt=11: y11=8, freeway 8, t=11 not unsafe, safe\n\nt=12: y12=9, safe.\n\nSo no collisions.\n\nH=12.\n\nBut can we do with less?\n\nFor example, at t=7, y=7, instead of going down, can we go up later or earlier.\n\nWe could be slower at the beginning to avoid the conflict.\n\nFor example, if we start by staying at y=0 for some turns, but that would increase H, not good.\n\nGo up to y=5 or something and wait.\n\nBut freeways 2-5 are always safe, so we can stay there.\n\nBut to reach y=9, we need to go through y=6,7,8 eventually.\n\nNow, the problem times are t=8 and t=9 for y=7 and 8.\n\nWe need to be on y=7 not at t=8 or t=9, similarly for y=8.\n\nIn the direct path, we are at y=7 at t=7, which is fine, but we cannot stay or go up at t=7 because next turn t=8 would be on y=7 or 8 at bad time.\n\nSo we have to leave y=7 before t=8 or not be there.\n\nAt t=7, we are at y=7, if we go down to y=6 at t=8, as before.\n\nCould we reach y=7 later, say after t=9.\n\nFor example, if we delay going up.\n\nStart at t=0, y=0.\n\nSuppose we do S at t=0, so y1=0 at t=1 (still y=0, safe)\n\nBut then we waste a turn.\n\nSimilarly, if we do S multiple times, H increases.\n\nNot better.\n\nGo up slowly.\n\nFor example, at t=0, do U, to y1=1 at t=1.\n\nThen at t=1, do S, stay at y=1, so y2=1 at t=2.\n\nThen continue, but still need to go up.\n\nBut freeway 1 is safe except t=16-19, which is late, so at t=2, y=1 is fine.\n\nBut to save time, better to go up fast until we hit the problem.\n\nAnother idea: since freeway 6 is safe after t=0, and we go to y=6 at t=6, which is fine.\n\nThen instead of going to y=7 immediately, we could stay at y=6 for a turn.\n\nAt t=6, y=6, if we do S, then y7=6 at t=7.\n\nThen at t=7, y=6, we can do U to y8=7 at t=8.\n\nBut at t=8, y=7, freeway 7, unsafe at t=8, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf at t=7, y=6, we do U, y8=7 at t=8, unsafe.\n\nIf we do S at t=7, y8=6 at t=8, safe.\n\nThen at t=8, y=6, do U to y9=7 at t=9, but t=9 y=7 unsafe.\n\nSame problem.\n\nSo we have to wait until t=10 to go to y=7.\n\nThus, from t=6, y=6, if we stay at y=6 until t=9, then go up.\n\nBut at t=6, y=6.\n\nIf we do S at t=6, y7=6 at t=7\n\nS at t=7, y8=6 at t=8\n\nS at t=8, y9=6 at t=9\n\nThen at t=9, do U, y10=7 at t=10, safe\n\nThen U to y11=8 at t=11, safe\n\nU to y12=9 at t=12\n\nBut we used three S actions, so H larger.\n\nCompared to previous, we had only one S and one D, but D then S, so two extra actions? In previous, we had a7=D and a8=S, then from y6 to y6 to y7, so we wasted two actions but from t=6 to t=9 we are at y=6, then up.\n\nIn the first plan, we were at y=7 at t=7, then down to y=6 at t=8, stay at y=6 at t=9, then up to y=7 at t=10.\n\nSo positions: t=7: y=7, t=8: y=6, t=9: y=6, t=10: y=7\n\nSo we spent t=8 and t=9 at y=6, which is not progressing.\n\nIn the all U, we would be at y=8 at t=8 if no problem, but we cannot.\n\nMinimal H should be 12 as above.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach earlier.\n\nSuppose we go to y=7 at a different time.\n\nFor example, if we start by going up to y=5 quickly, then wait, but y=5 is safe.\n\nAt t=0: U, y1=1 t=1\n\na1:U, y2=2 t=2\n\na2:U, y3=3 t=3\n\na3:U, y4=4 t=4\n\na4:U, y5=5 t=5\n\nNow at t=5, y=5, we can do S to stay, so y6=5 at t=6\n\nThen at t=6, y=5, do U to y7=6 at t=7 (freeway 6, safe)\n\nThen at t=7, y=6, do U to y8=7 at t=8, but t=8 y=7 unsafe.\n\nSame issue.\n\nAt t=7, y=6, do S to y8=6 at t=8, safe\n\nThen U to y9=7 at t=9, unsafe.\n\nSo still need to wait until t=10 for y=7.\n\nThus, from y=5 at t=5, if we stay until t=9, but t=9 we can go to y=6 or something.\n\nAt t=5, y=5, do S: y6=5 t=6\n\nS: y7=5 t=7\n\nS: y8=5 t=8\n\nS: y9=5 t=9\n\nThen at t=9, U to y10=6 t=10\n\nU to y11=7 t=11\n\nBut t=11, y=7, freeway 7 at t=11 safe? Yes, t=11 not 0,1,8,9.\n\nThen U to y12=8 t=12\n\nU to y13=9 t=13\n\nH=13, worse than 12.\n\nNot better.\n\nAfter y=5 at t=5, we could go up to y=6 at t=6, then stay at y=6 until t=9, then up.\n\nt=5: y=5\n\na5:U to y6=6 t=6\n\nThen at t=6, y=6, do S: y7=6 t=7\n\nS: y8=6 t=8\n\nS: y9=6 t=9\n\nThen a9:U to y10=7 t=10\n\na10:U to y11=8 t=11\n\na11:U to y12=9 t=12\n\nSame as first plan, H=12.\n\nIn the first plan with down, we had y=7 at t=7, then down to y=6 at t=8, same as staying at y=6 from t=8, but in that case we had y=7 at t=7 which is one step higher, but we went down, so net same.\n\nIn terms of time to reach, it's the same H=12.\n\nCan we reach y=9 by t=10 or 11?\n\nFor example, if we can be on y=8 at t=10 or something.\n\nBut to reach y=9, we need to be on y=8 at some point.\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=8,9.\n\nSo if we are on y=8 at t=10, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at t=10 safe.\n\nNow, what is the earliest we can be at y=7 safely after t=9.\n\nt=10 is ok.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at t=10 or later.\n\nNow, to be at y=7 at t=10, we need to have y_t for t<10.\n\ny increases by at most 1 per turn.\n\nStart y0=0.\n\nAfter 10 turns, y10 <=10, but y=9 is the goal, so possible to be at y=9 at t=10 if all U.\n\nBut in that case, y10=9, but to be at y=9, we must have been at y=8 at t=9 or earlier? y9=8 if a8=U from y8.\n\nBut at t=9, if y9=8, freeway 8, unsafe at t=9.\n\nIf we are at y=8 at t=10, then y10=8, and we can go to y=9 at t=11.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nSuppose we want y10=7 or something.\n\nEarliest time to be at high y.\n\nBut with the constraint.\n\nSince freeway 1 has unsafe at t=16-19, but that is late, and we are going up early, so we are not on y=1 at t=16-19, since we pass y=1 early.\n\nIn the beginning, we pass y=1 at t=1, which is before t=16, so safe.\n\nNo issue from freeway 1 for early path.\n\nOnly the high freeways 7 and 8 have early unsafe times t=8,9.\n\nSo the bottleneck is around t=8,9 for y=7,8.\n\nThus, to avoid, we need to not be on y=7 or 8 at t=8 or t=9.\n\nIn the sequence, we should be below y=7 at t=8 and t=9.\n\nFor example, at t=8, we can be at y<=6.\n\nSimilarly at t=9, y<=6.\n\nThen after that, go up.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 fast, we should be as high as possible before t=8, but not on 7 or 8 at bad times.\n\nFor instance, at t=7, we can be at y=6 or y=7.\n\nIf at y=7 at t=7, we must go down to avoid being at y=7 or 8 at t=8.\n\nIf we are at y=6 at t=7, we can stay or go down.\n\nBut better to be high.\n\nSo at t=7, y=6 or y=7.\n\nIf y=6 at t=7, we can stay at y=6 for t=8 and t=9, then go up at t=10.\n\nBut to be at y=6 at t=7, we need to have reached y=6 by t=7.\n\nStart from y=0, after 7 actions, y7 <=7.\n\nTo be y=6 at t=7, we can have one S or D earlier, but that might delay.\n\nFor example, if all U except one S, y7=6 if we had one S.\n\nBut let's see minimal.\n\nWith all U: y0=0, a0=U y1=1, ..., up to y7=7 at t=7.\n\nTo have y7=6, we need to have one less U, so for example, at some point do S or D.\n\nBut D might not help, since we can only go down from higher.\n\nFor instance, at t=0, if we do S, y1=0, then a1=U y2=1, ..., a6=U y7=6? t=0 a0=S, y1=0; t=1 a1=U y2=1; ... t=6 a6=U y7=6?

Or something.\n\nTo have y9=6.\n\nThen from there.\n\nBut to minimize H, we want to reach y=6 as fast as possible, then wait until t=9, then go up.\n\nBut at t=6, y6=6, if we stay until t=9, we need to do S at t=6,7,8.\n\nSo y7=6, y8=6, y9=6.\n\nThen at t=9, a9=U to y10=7\n\nThen a10=U to y11=8\n\na11=U to y12=9\n\nH=12.\n\nIf we reach y=6 later, H larger.\n\nSo minimal H is 12.\n\nIn the first plan, we went up to y=7 at t=7, then down to y=6 at t=8, which is similar to being at y=6 at t=8 directly, but in terms of time, same.\n\nBut in that case, we had y=7 at t=7, which we didn't use, so no benefit.\n\nThus, H=12 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the sequence.\n\nIn the answer, we need to output actions starting from turn t1=48.\n\nSo relative t=0 is absolute turn 48.\n\nActions: for turn 48, 49, ..., up to turn 48 + 11? After 12 actions, at turn 48+12=60, position y=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions: from t=0 to t=11 relative.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t1: a_{t1}, etc.\n\nt1=48.\n\nSo actions for turn 48 to turn 48+H-1.\n\nH=12, so actions from turn 48 to turn 59.\n\nAfter action at turn 59, position at turn 60 is y=9.\n\nNow, sequence as in the first plan:\n\nAt turn 48 (t=0): action U, to y=1 at turn 49\n\nTurn 49 (t=1): action U, to y=2 at turn 50\n\nTurn 50 (t=2): U, to y=3 at turn 51\n\nTurn 51 (t=3): U, to y=4 at turn 52\n\nTurn 52 (t=4): U, to y=5 at turn 53\n\nTurn 53 (t=5): U, to y=6 at turn 54\n\nTurn 54 (t=6): U, to y=7 at turn 55\n\nTurn 55 (t=7): action D, to y=6 at turn 56\n\nTurn 56 (t=8): action S, to y=6 at turn 57 (since S, no change)\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with S, Δy=0, so y_{t+1} = y_t.\n\nAt turn 56 (t=8), position y=6, action S, so y_{57} = y_56 + 0 = 6\n\nThen turn 57 (t=9): action U, to y=7 at turn 58\n\nTurn 58 (t=10): U, to y=8 at turn 59\n\nTurn 59 (t=11): U, to y=9 at turn 60\n\nAt turn 60, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, in the sequence, actions from turn 48 to 59.\n\nIn the output, it should be:\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: U\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: D\n\nTurn 56: S\n\nTurn 57: U\n\nTurn 58: U\n\nTurn 59: U\n\nIn the car state, freeway 6 has two cars, but we didn't have issue.\n\nAlso, freeway 1 unsafe at t=16-19, but we are not on it then.\n\nt=16 relative is absolute turn 48+16=64, which is after we finish, since we end at turn 60.\n\nSimilarly, no problem.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 55 (abs), which is t=7 rel, we do D, from y=7 to y=6.\n\nThen turn 56: S, stay at y=6.\n\nThen turn 57: U to y=7.\n\nNow, at turn 57, abs turn 57, rel t=9, position y=6? Let's list absolute turns.\n\nAbsolute turn | relative t | position before action | action | position after action (for next turn)\n\nBetter to think of position at turn.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nFor turn 48: y=0, action a48\n\nAfter a48, y49 = y48 + Δy48\n\nThen at turn 49: y49, action a49, and so on.\n\nCollision at turn T based on y_T.\n\nIn sequence:\n\n- Turn 48: y48=0, action a48=U → y49=1\n\n- Turn 49: y49=1, action a49=U → y50=2\n\n- Turn 50: y50=2, action a50=U → y51=3\n\n- Turn 51: y51=3, action a51=U → y52=4\n\n- Turn 52: y52=4, action a52=U → y53=5\n\n- Turn 53: y53=5, action a53=U → y54=6\n\n- Turn 54: y54=6, action a54=U → y55=7\n\n- Turn 55: y55=7, action a55=D → y56=6\n\n- Turn 56: y56=6, action a56=S → y57=6\n\n- Turn 57: y57=6, action a57=U → y58=7\n\n- Turn 58: y58=7, action a58=U → y59=8\n\n- Turn 59: y59=8, action a59=U → y60=9\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nTurn 48: y=0, not freeway, safe\n\nTurn 49: y=1, freeway 1, t rel=1, abs 49, not unsafe (unsafe t=16-19 rel, abs 64-67), safe\n\nTurn 50: y=2, freeway 2, always safe\n\nTurn 51: y=3, freeway 3, safe\n\nTurn 52: y=4, freeway 4, safe\n\nTurn 53: y=5, freeway 5, safe\n\nTurn 54: y=6, freeway 6, at t rel=6, abs 54, unsafe only at t=0 rel, so safe\n\nTurn 55: y=7, freeway 7, t rel=7, abs 55, unsafe times rel t=0,1,8,9. t=7 not in, safe\n\nTurn 56: y=6, freeway 6, t rel=8, abs 56, safe (t>0)\n\nTurn 57: y=6, freeway 6, t rel=9, abs 57, safe\n\nTurn 58: y=7, freeway 7, t rel=10, abs 58, not unsafe (unsafe t=0,1,8,9 rel), t=10 safe\n\nTurn 59: y=8, freeway 8, t rel=11, abs 59, not unsafe, safe\n\nTurn 60: y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nH=12.\n\nIn the action sequence, for turn 59, we do U to y=9 at turn 60.\n\nThe sequence is up to turn 59, with 12 actions.\n\nAnswer should be actions for turn 48 to 59.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 6 has a car at (0,-11,right,12) at t1=48, which at t=0 rel, span [-11,0], but at t=0, player not on freeway 6, so ok.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nI think this is fine.\n\nSo minimal H=12.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 48\\) with the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the sequence of actions must ensure that the player is never on a freeway row when a car on that row has a span covering \\(x = 0\\) at that turn.\n\n### Analysis of Car Hazards\n- **Freeway 1**: Unsafe at turns \\(t = 16, 17, 18, 19\\) relative to \\(t_1 = 48\\) (absolute turns 64, 65, 66, 67). Safe at other times.\n- **Freeway 2, 3, 4, 5**: Always safe, as no car covers \\(x = 0\\) at any time.\n- **Freeway 6**: Unsafe only at \\(t = 0\\) relative (absolute turn 48). Safe for \\(t \\geq 1\\).\n- **Freeway 7 and 8**: Unsafe at \\(t = 0, 1, 8, 9\\) relative (absolute turns 48, 49, 56, 57). Safe at other times.\n\nThe player starts at \\(y = 0\\) (safe) at turn 48. To minimize \\(H\\), the player should move up (U) as much as possible but must avoid being on freeway 7 or 8 at turns 56 or 57 (absolute), as these are unsafe. The direct upward path would reach \\(y = 8\\) at turn 56 (absolute), which is unsafe. Therefore, a detour is necessary around these turns.\n\n### Optimal Path\nThe minimal \\(H\\) is 12 turns, with the player reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 60 (absolute). The sequence involves:\n- Moving up directly to \\(y = 7\\) by turn 55 (absolute).\n- At turn 55, moving down (D) to \\(y = 6\\) to avoid being on \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) at the unsafe turn 56.\n- Staying (S) at \\(y = 6\\) at turn 56 to avoid progression during the unsafe turn 57.\n- Moving up from \\(y = 6\\) to \\(y = 9\\) over turns 57–59, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 60.\n\nThis path ensures no collisions:\n- At turn 55 (\\(y = 7\\), freeway 7), the relative turn is 7 (absolute 55), which is safe for freeway 7.\n- At turn 56 (\\(y = 6\\), freeway 6), the relative turn is 8 (absolute 56), which is safe for freeway 6.\n- At turn 57 (\\(y = 6\\), freeway 6), the relative turn is 9 (absolute 57), which is safe for freeway 6.\n- At turn 58 (\\(y = 7\\), freeway 7), the relative turn is 10 (absolute 58), which is safe for freeway 7.\n- At turn 59 (\\(y = 8\\), freeway 8), the relative turn is 11 (absolute 59), which is safe for freeway 8.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions for turns 48 to 59 (12 actions) is as follows:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 48: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 49: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 50: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 51: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 52: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 53: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 54: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 55: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 56: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 57: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 58: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 59: U \\\\ \\end{array} }\n\nThis results in the player reaching \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 60 with \\(H = 12\\), the minimal number of turns.",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,2) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The cars are moving, and I have to make sure that when I'm on a freeway row at a certain turn, I don't collide with any car on that row at that turn.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car movements. All cars are moving right, based on the directions given. For right-moving cars, the span at turn T is [τ + s(T - t1), h + s(T - t1)], since for right-moving, span is [τ, h] at t1, so it moves right with speed s.\n\nIn the car state, it says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, span is [τ, h] with τ < h, I assume. Let me confirm the notation.\n\nFrom the update rule: for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] → span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly, left-moving would be [h, τ] with h < τ, but here all are right-moving, so τ should be less than h.\n\nLooking at the car states:\n\nFor freeway 1: (-42, -53, right, 3). Head -42, tail -53? But -42 > -53, so if it's right-moving, span should be [tail, head] = [-53, -42]? But it's written as (head, tail) = (-42, -53), which would imply head is left of tail if numbers increase to the right? I think I need to clarify the coordinate system.\n\nThe grid is vertical y=0 to 9, but the cars are on horizontal freeways, so the position is in terms of x-coordinate, I assume. The player is at (0, y), so x=0 is the position, and cars have spans on the x-axis.\n\nAt turn T, collision occurs only if the player is at x=0 and on freeway y, and 0 is within the span of a car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nThe key point is that when you move, you are on y_t at turn t, and you check collision for that y at turn t.\n\nAlso, when you decide to move to y_{t+1} ≠ y_t at turn t, you are not on y_{t+1} at turn t, so you only care about the freeway you are currently on at each turn.\n\nNow, for the car positions: for a right-moving car, at t1, span is [τ, h] with τ < h, meaning tail at τ, head at h, and it moves right, so at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)].\n\nIn the given data, for freeway 1: (h, τ, d, s) = (-42, -53, right, 3)\n\nSince d=right, and h = -42, τ = -53, but -42 > -53, so if we assume x increases to the right, then τ = -53 is left, h = -42 is right, so span is [τ, h] = [-53, -42] at t1.\n\nThen at time T, span is [ -53 + 3(T-50), -42 + 3(T-50) ] because s=3, t1=50.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nt1 is 50, current turn.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,2) at turn 50.\n\nI need to reach (0,9), so y=9, which is the top row. y=0 to 9, so 9 is the goal.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars. The collision is only with cars on freeways y=1 to 8, so when on y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nBut we start at y=2, which is a freeway, and need to get to y=9.\n\nNow, the actions: U increases y by 1, D decreases by 1, S stays. y between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nTo minimize H, the number of turns, I probably want to go up as fast as possible, but I have to avoid the cars on the rows when I'm on them.\n\nSince I start at y=2, and need to go to y=9, I need to move up 7 steps, so minimum moves would be 7 Up actions, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, but that would increase H, so probably I should go up directly if possible, but I have to check for collisions on each row at the time I'm on it.\n\nH is the number of turns including the actions from t=0 to H-1, so from turn t1 to t1 + H -1, after H actions, I should be at y=9.\n\nAt turn t1, I am at position (0, y_t1), and I take actions a_t1, a_t1+1, ..., up to a_t1+H-1, and after H actions, at turn t1+H, I am at y=9.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position y_t.\n\nI take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t, I am on freeway y_t (if between 1 and 8), and I check if there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in its span at turn t.\n\nIf I am on y_t and 0 in span for some car on y_t at t, collision.\n\nIf I move to y_{t+1} different from y_t, at turn t I am on y_t, not on y_{t+1}, so I don't care about cars on y_{t+1} at turn t.\n\nNow, for the car positions at future turns.\n\nt1=50, current turn.\n\nI need to find for each freeway and for each future turn, when is there a car such that 0 is in its span on that freeway.\n\nThat is, for freeway k, at turn T, is 0 in the span of any car on k at T.\n\nIf yes, then if I am on k at turn T, I will collide.\n\nOtherwise, safe on that row at that turn.\n\nSince the cars are moving, the collision points depend on time.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: only one car: (h, τ, d, s) = (-42, -53, right, 3)\n\nSince d=right, span at T: [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-53 + 3(T-50), -42 + 3(T-50)]\n\n0 in span if -53 + 3(T-50) ≤ 0 ≤ -42 + 3(T-50)\n\nSet ΔT = T - 50, so time since current turn.\n\nThen  -53 + 3ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -42 + 3ΔT\n\nWhich is 3ΔT ≤ 53 and 3ΔT ≥ 42? Let's solve:\n\n-53 + 3ΔT ≤ 0 ⇒ 3ΔT ≤ 53 ⇒ ΔT ≤ 53/3 ≈ 17.666, so ΔT ≤ 17\n\nAnd 0 ≤ -42 + 3ΔT ⇒ 3ΔT ≥ 42 ⇒ ΔT ≥ 14\n\nSo for ΔT from 14 to 17 inclusive, 0 is in span on freeway 1.\n\nT from 50+14=64 to 50+17=67.\n\nAt turns 64,65,66,67, on freeway 1, there is a car at x=0.\n\nNow freeway 2: (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nSimilarly, span at T: [-59 + 12(ΔT), -48 + 12(ΔT)]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 12ΔT\n\n-59 + 12ΔT ≤ 0 ⇒ 12ΔT ≤ 59 ⇒ ΔT ≤ 59/12 ≈ 4.916, so ΔT ≤ 4\n\n0 ≤ -48 + 12ΔT ⇒ 12ΔT ≥ 48 ⇒ ΔT ≥ 4\n\nSo ΔT=4, exactly.\n\nAt ΔT=4, -59 + 12*4 = -59+48= -11 ≤ 0, and -48+48=0 ≤0? 0 ≤ 0, which is true, so yes, 0 in span at ΔT=4.\n\nT=50+4=54.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? (-48, -59, right, 12), identical, so same: collision at ΔT=4, T=54.\n\nFreeway 4: same, (-48, -59, right, 12), collision at T=54.\n\nFreeway 5: same, T=54.\n\nNow freeway 6: two cars: (-48, -59, right, 12) and (24, 13, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: same as above, collision at T=54.\n\nSecond car: (h,τ,d,s) = (24,13,right,12)\n\nHead 24, tail 13? But 24>13, so for right-moving, span at t1: [τ,h] = [13,24]? But written as (head,tail), so head=24, tail=13, so span [13,24] at t1.\n\nThen at T: [13 + 12(ΔT), 24 + 12(ΔT)]\n\n0 in span if 13 +12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 24 +12ΔT\n\n13 +12ΔT ≤ 0? 12ΔT ≤ -13? But ΔT ≥0, 12ΔT ≥0, so 13+12ΔT ≥13 >0, so left inequality never true. Thus 0 not in span for this car at any T.\n\nSimilarly, first car has collision at T=54, as before.\n\nSo for freeway 6, only at T=54 there is collision from first car.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars: (-36, -47, right, 6) and (12, 1, right, 6)\n\nFirst car: (h,τ) = (-36,-47), d=right, s=6\n\nSpan at t1: [τ,h] = [-47,-36]? Since τ=-47, h=-36.\n\nAt T: [-47 + 6ΔT, -36 + 6ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -47 +6ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -36 +6ΔT\n\n-47 +6ΔT ≤ 0 ⇒ 6ΔT ≤ 47 ⇒ ΔT ≤ 47/6 ≈7.833, so ΔT ≤7\n\n0 ≤ -36 +6ΔT ⇒ 6ΔT ≥36 ⇒ ΔT ≥6\n\nSo ΔT from 6 to 7 inclusive: T=56,57.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,6), span at t1: [τ,h] = [1,12]? Head=12, tail=1, so [1,12]\n\nAt T: [1 +6ΔT, 12 +6ΔT]\n\n0 in span: 1+6ΔT ≤0 ≤12+6ΔT\n\n1+6ΔT ≤0? 6ΔT ≤ -1, impossible since ΔT≥0. So never.\n\nThus for freeway 7, collision at T=56 and 57.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same cars, (-36,-47,right,6) and (12,1,right,6), so same as freeway 7: collision at T=56,57.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway when it is dangerous (collision at x=0):\n\nFreeway 1: dangerous at T=64,65,66,67\n\nFreeway 2: dangerous at T=54\n\nFreeway 3: dangerous at T=54\n\nFreeway 4: dangerous at T=54\n\nFreeway 5: dangerous at T=54\n\nFreeway 6: dangerous at T=54 (only from first car)\n\nFreeway 7: dangerous at T=56,57\n\nFreeway 8: dangerous at T=56,57\n\nAt other times, no collision on that row.\n\nNow, player starts at turn 50, y=2.\n\nI need to go from y=2 to y=9, with minimum moves.\n\nEach U action increases y by 1, D decreases, S stays.\n\ny must be integer between 0 and 9.\n\nSince I need to increase y by 7, from 2 to 9, minimum H=7 if I can go straight up with U each turn.\n\nBut I have to avoid being on a dangerous row at a dangerous time.\n\nThat is, for each turn, when I am on a row between 1 and 8, it must not be dangerous at that turn.\n\nIf I am on y=0 or y=9, no problem.\n\nNow, let's see if I can go straight up.\n\nSuppose I start at turn 50, y=2.\n\nAt turn 50, I am on y=2. Is y=2 dangerous at T=50? Freeway 2 is dangerous only at T=54, not at 50, so safe.\n\nI take action a_50, which determines y_51.\n\nBut at turn 50, I am on y=2, and it's safe, so I can take an action.\n\nSimilarly, after action, at turn 51, I am on y_51, and so on.\n\nLet me denote the turn sequence.\n\nSet t=0 relative to t1, so let τ = t - t1, so at τ=0, turn 50, y=2.\n\nI take actions a_{50} to a_{50+H-1}, and at turn 50+H, y_{50+H} =9.\n\nAfter H actions, I am at turn t1 + H.\n\nAt each turn from 50 to 50+H-1, I am at some y, and must not collide.\n\nAt turn 50+H, I am at y=9, which is safe.\n\nNow, for minimum H, start with H=7.\n\nIf I go up each step, I will be on y=2 at τ=0 (turn 50), y=3 at τ=1 (turn 51), ..., up to y=9 at τ=7 (turn 57).\n\nLet's list:\n\nAfter 0 actions: turn 50, y=2\n\nAfter 1 action: turn 51, y= depends on action\n\nGenerally, at turn t, before action, I am at y_t.\n\nAfter taking a_t, I move to y_{t+1}.\n\nBut for collision, at turn t, I am at y_t, and we check collision at that position.\n\nSo for each turn t from 50 onwards, as long as I am on freeway, we check.\n\nIn the sequence: at turn 50, I start at y=2, take a_50, then at turn 51, I am at y_51, take a_51, and so on, up to after H actions, at turn 50+H, I am at y=9.\n\nAt turn 50+H, since y=9, no collision.\n\nNow, for turns from 50 to 50+H-1, I am at some y, and must be safe if y between 1 and 8.\n\nNow, for H=7, I want to be at y=9 at turn 57.\n\nTurn 57 is 50+7.\n\nIf I go straight up: start at turn 50, y=2.\n\nAfter a_50=U, at turn 51, y=3\n\na_51=U, turn 52, y=4\n\na_52=U, turn 53, y=5\n\na_53=U, turn 54, y=6\n\na_54=U, turn 55, y=7\n\na_55=U, turn 56, y=8\n\na_56=U, turn 57, y=9\n\nNow, check for each turn:\n\nTurn 50: y=2, freeway 2. Dangerous at T=54, not 50, so safe.\n\nTurn 51: y=3, freeway 3. Dangerous only at T=54, not 51, safe.\n\nTurn 52: y=4, freeway 4. Dangerous at T=54, not 52, safe.\n\nTurn 53: y=5, freeway 5. Dangerous at T=54, not 53, safe.\n\nTurn 54: y=6, freeway 6. Dangerous at T=54, yes! Freeway 6 has collision at T=54. So at turn 54, y=6, which is freeway 6, and T=54, collision! Not safe.\n\nSo I cannot be on freeway 6 at turn 54.\n\nIn this path, at turn 54, I am on y=6, which is dangerous.\n\nSo collision.\n\nThus, straight up in 7 moves is not possible because of turn 54 on y=6.\n\nNow, turn 55: y=7, freeway 7. Dangerous at T=56 and 57. Turn 55 is not 56 or 57, so safe? T=55, freeway 7 dangerous only at 56 and 57, so at 55, safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 56: y=8, freeway 8 dangerous at T=56 and 57, so at turn 56, y=8, dangerous! Collision.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 56, y=8, which is dangerous at T=56.\n\nSo two problems: turn 54 on y=6 collision, and turn 56 on y=8 collision.\n\nTurn 57 is y=9, safe.\n\nSo definitely cannot go straight up.\n\nNeed to avoid being on certain rows at certain times.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- Cannot be on freeway 6 at turn 54\n\n- Cannot be on freeway 7 at turns 56 or 57\n\n- Cannot be on freeway 8 at turns 56 or 57\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 both dangerous at 56 and 57.\n\nAlso, freeway 1 dangerous at 64-67, but that might be later, not relevant for min H.\n\nSince I need to reach by turn 57 or earlier? H is min, so I might reach earlier or later.\n\nIn straight up, I reach at turn 57, but with collisions.\n\nTo avoid collision at turn 54 on y=6, I need to not be on y=6 at turn 54.\n\nSimilarly, not on y=7 or 8 at turns 56 or 57? Freeway 7 at T=56,57 dangerous, so if I am on y=7 at turn 56 or 57, collision.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nBut at turn 56, if I am on y=7, and it's dangerous, collision, but if I move to y=8 at turn 56, at turn 56 I am on y=7 before moving? Let's think carefully.\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t.\n\nIf y_t between 1-8, check collision on that row at turn t.\n\nThen I take action a_t, which moves to y_{t+1} for turn t+1.\n\nSo for turn 54, if I am on y=6 and it is dangerous, collision when I am there at turn 54.\n\nSimilarly for turn 56 on y=8.\n\nNow, to avoid collision at turn 54 on y=6, I can either not be on y=6 at turn 54, or be on y=6 but at a different time when it is safe.\n\nFreeway 6 is only dangerous at turn 54, as we saw, so at other times, safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 and 8 dangerous only at 56 and 57, so at other times safe.\n\nFreeway 6: dangerous only at T=54\n\nFreeway 7: dangerous at T=56,57\n\nFreeway 8: dangerous at T=56,57\n\nNow, for min H, since I start at y=2 at turn 50, and need to reach y=9.\n\nThe critical times are around turn 54 and 56-57.\n\nI might need to slow down or speed up or detour.\n\nBut detour might take more moves.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 are safe, I can go to y=0 or y=9 to wait.\n\ny=9 is goal, so if I reach early, I can stop, but since I need to be at (0,9), and after reaching, I don't need to move, but in the sequence, once I reach y=9, I can stay or whatever, but since it's safe, I can just be there.\n\nBut for min H, I want to reach as soon as possible.\n\nH is the number of actions to reach, so min H means reaching in min turns after start.\n\nFrom turn 50, I want to reach y=9 at some turn with min number of actions.\n\nSince each U action increases y, min number of U actions is 7, but I might have S or D actions which increase H.\n\nSo min H is at least 7, but could be more.\n\nFirst, can I reach by turn 57 with H=7 but different path?\n\nIn straight up, I have problems at turn 54 and 56.\n\nTurn 54: if I am not on y=6 at turn 54, I can avoid that collision.\n\nFor example, at turn 54, if I am on a different row.\n\nSimilarly for turn 56.\n\nNow, in the sequence, at turn 53, I am at y=5 (if going up), then I take action to go to y=6 at turn 54, but at turn 54 y=6 is bad.\n\nI could at turn 53, instead of going to y=6, I stay or go down.\n\nBut let's list the turns.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at turn T for some T.\n\nSince min H, I should aim for small T.\n\nBut with constraints.\n\nLet me consider the y at each turn.\n\nStart: turn 50, y=2\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe dangerous points are:\n\n- At turn 54: y=6 is dangerous\n\n- At turn 56: y=7 and y=8 are dangerous? Freeway 7 dangerous at T=56,57, so y=7 at turn 56 or 57 dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at turn 56 or 57 dangerous.\n\nAlso, turn 57: y=7 or y=8 dangerous.\n\nBut turn 57, if I am on y=9, safe.\n\nNow, for freeway 7, dangerous at 56 and 57, so if I am on y=7 at turn 56 or 57, collision.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nBut at turn 56, if I am on y=7, collision; at turn 57, if I am on y=7, collision.\n\nSame for y=8.\n\nTo avoid, I must not be on y=7 at turn 56 or 57, and not on y=8 at turn 56 or 57.\n\nAlso not on y=6 at turn 54.\n\nOther rows are safe at those times, or at all times except as above.\n\nFreeway 1 dangerous at 64-67, but since I want to reach by 57 or earlier, probably not relevant.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4,5 dangerous only at 54, so at other times safe.\n\nBut at turn 54, only y=6 is dangerous among the freeways, but y=6 is the only one with collision at that turn, but other rows are safe at turn 54.\n\nFor example, at turn 54, if I am on y=5, freeway 5 is dangerous only at T=54, so at turn 54, y=5 is dangerous! I forgot that.\n\nFreeway 5 is dangerous at T=54.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 at T=54, etc.\n\nLet's list all dangerous (turn, freeway) pairs:\n\nFrom above:\n\n- (54,2), (54,3), (54,4), (54,5), (54,6)  // since freeway 2 to 6 all dangerous at T=54\n\nFreeway 2,3,4,5,6 all have collision at T=54.\n\nFreeway 6 has at T=54, freeway 2 to 5 also at T=54.\n\nFreeway 2: dangerous at T=54\n\nFreeway 3: T=54\n\nFreeway 4: T=54\n\nFreeway 5: T=54\n\nFreeway 6: T=54\n\nAll of them at T=54.\n\nThen freeway 7: (56,7), (57,7)\n\nFreeway 8: (56,8), (57,8)\n\nFreeway 1: (64,1) to (67,1) but later.\n\nSo at turn 54, all freeways from 2 to 6 are dangerous! That means if I am on any of y=2,3,4,5,6 at turn 54, I will collide.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 56, if on y=7 or y=8, collide; at turn 57, if on y=7 or y=8, collide.\n\nTo be safe:\n\n- At turn 54, I must not be on any freeway from 2 to 6, meaning I must be on y=0,1,7,8,9. But y=1 is freeway, but freeway 1 is not dangerous at T=54, only at 64-67.\n\nFreeway 1: dangerous at T=64-67, not at 54.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 and 8 dangerous at 56-57, not at 54.\n\nAt turn 54, freeways 1,7,8 are safe, since not dangerous at that time.\n\nFreeway 1: dangerous only at 64-67, so at 54, safe.\n\nFreeway 7: dangerous at 56-57, so at 54, safe.\n\nSimilarly freeway 8 safe at 54.\n\nBut y=0 and y=9 are always safe.\n\nSo at turn 54, to avoid collision, I must be on y=0,1,7,8, or 9.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 56, must not be on y=7 or 8? At turn 56, if on y=7 or y=8, collision, since dangerous.\n\nMust not be on y=7 or y=8 at turn 56.\n\nSimilarly at turn 57, must not be on y=7 or y=8.\n\nNow, y=7 and 8 are only dangerous at 56 and 57, so at other times, safe.\n\nBack to reaching y=9 with min H.\n\nI start at turn 50, y=2.\n\nIf I go straight up, I would be at turn 54 on y=6, which is bad.\n\nI need to be at a safe row at turn 54.\n\nSafe rows at turn 54: y=0,1,7,8,9\n\ny=1 is freeway 1, which is safe at turn 54.\n\nSimilarly, y=7,8,9.\n\nNow, from y=2 at turn 50, to be at say y=7 at turn 54.\n\nTurn 50 to 54 is 4 turns: from turn 50 to 51,51 to52,52 to53,53 to54: 4 actions.\n\ny from 2 to 7, difference 5, so I need to go up 5 in 4 steps, which requires moving up every time, but 4 ups from y=2: at turn 51 y=3, turn52 y=4, turn53 y=5, turn54 y=6, but y=6 is not safe at turn54.\n\ny=6 is in 2-6, not safe.\n\nTo reach y=7 at turn54, I need to go from y=2 to y=7 in 4 actions, which means I must have 5 U actions, but only 4 actions? Actions from turn50 to53.\n\nAt turn50: after action, at turn51 y=new, etc.\n\nLet's think in terms of position at each turn.\n\nAt turn50: y=2\n\nAfter action a50, at turn51: y51 = y50 + delta a50\n\nSimilarly.\n\nFrom turn50 to turn54, there are 4 actions: a50,a51,a52,a53, determining y51,y52,y53,y54.\n\ny50=2, y54 = y50 + sum of delta from a50 to a53.\n\nEach delta is +1, -1, or 0.\n\nTo have y54=7, need sum of 4 deltas = +5, which is impossible since each <=1, max sum +4, so y54 <= 2+4=6.\n\nSimilarly, min y54=2-4=-2, but y>=0, so y54 <=6.\n\nSimilarly, to have y54=8 or 9, impossible in 4 steps from 2.\n\ny54=7: max y54=6, as above.\n\ny54=1: min y54 with y>=0, possible, e.g., go down or stay.\n\ny54=0: possible.\n\nBut y=7,8,9 not reachable at turn54 from y=2 in 4 actions.\n\nWith 4 actions, y54 can be from max(0,2-4) to min(9,2+4), so from 0 to 6.\n\nSo at turn54, I can only be on y=0,1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\nBut safe rows at turn54 are y=0,1,7,8,9, but y=7,8,9 not reachable, so only possible safe at turn54 are y=0 or y=1.\n\ny=1 is freeway 1, which is safe at turn54.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 safe.\n\nNow, y=2,3,4,5,6 all dangerous at turn54.\n\nSo at turn54, I must be on y=0 or y=1.\n\nNow, from y=2 at turn50, I need to reach y=0 or y=1 at turn54.\n\ny=0 or 1 at turn54.\n\nWith 4 actions, from y=2.\n\nTo reach y=1: need net change -1, so sum of deltas = -1.\n\nTo reach y=0: net change -2, sum deltas = -2.\n\nThen after that, I need to go to y=9.\n\nAlso, I have the issue at turns 56 and 57.\n\nFirst, let's ensure turn54 is safe.\n\nSo, suppose at turn54, I am on y=1 (since y=0 is lower, might be harder to reach y=9).\n\ny=1 at turn54.\n\nThen from there, I need to reach y=9.\n\nTurn54 to when? I want min H, so reach asap.\n\nBut I have to avoid turn56 and 57 on y=7 or 8.\n\nNow, let's list the actions.\n\nFirst, from turn50 to turn54: 4 actions to go from y=2 to y=1 or 0.\n\nTo y=1: net -1, so for example, one D and three S, or one S, one D, and two U? But need net -1.\n\nEasier to have some S or D.\n\nSince min H, I should not waste actions, but to go to y=1, I need to decrease y, which might cost extra actions.\n\nFor example, to go from y=2 to y=1 in one step: a50=D, then at turn51, y=1.\n\nBut turn51 is before turn54.\n\nI need to be at y=1 at turn54, not earlier.\n\nSo I need to arrive at y=1 exactly at turn54 or stay there.\n\nSimilarly, I can go to y=1 earlier and stay.\n\nBut staying might increase H.\n\nSince I need to be at y=1 at turn54, I can reach earlier and stay, or reach at that turn.\n\nBut to min H, I should reach turn54 at y=1 with as few actions as possible, but since I have to take actions to get there, and the actions are fixed in number for the interval.\n\nFrom turn50 to turn54, I must take 4 actions, regardless.\n\nEach action changes or stays.\n\nThe position at turn54 depends on the actions.\n\ny54 = y50 + sum_{k=50 to53} delta a_k\n\ny50=2\n\ndelta a_k: +1, -1, 0 for U,D,S.\n\ny54 = 2 + sum_{t=50}^{53} delta a_t\n\nI need y54 = 0 or 1.\n\nIf y54=1, then sum delta = -1\n\nIf y54=0, sum delta = -2\n\nThen, after that, from turn54 on, I need to go to y=9.\n\ny at turn54 is 0 or 1.\n\ny=9 is 8 or 9 steps away.\n\nNow, also, turns 56 and 57: must not be on y=7 or y=8 at those turns.\n\nFirst, let's handle turn54.\n\nI need to have y54=0 or 1.\n\nWith 4 actions, net change -1 or -2.\n\nFor example, to have net -1: possibilities: three S and one D: sum delta = 0+0+0-1 = -1, y54=2-1=1\n\nOr two S, one D, one U: but U and D cancel, +1-1=0, plus two S, sum=0, y54=2, not 1.\n\nIf I do U and D, net zero, with S, still net zero.\n\nTo have net -1, I need one more D than U, and S don't change.\n\nSince 4 actions, let num U, num D, num S, with U + D + S =4, and y54 -2 = U - D, so U - D = -1 if y54=1, or U - D = -2 if y54=0.\n\nAlso U + D + S =4.\n\nFor y54=1: U - D = -1\n\nU + D + S =4\n\nThen from U - D = -1, U = D -1\n\nThen (D-1) + D + S =4, 2D + S =5\n\nSince D and S integers, D>=1.\n\nPossible: D=1, S=3, U=0\n\nD=2, S=1, U=1? U=D-1=1, then U=1,D=2,S=1, sum U+D+S=4, U-D=1-2=-1, yes.\n\nD=3, S= -1 impossible.\n\nSo possibilities: (U,D,S) = (0,1,3) or (1,2,1)\n\nSimilarly for y54=0: U-D=-2\n\nU = D-2\n\nThen (D-2) + D + S =4, 2D + S =6\n\nD>=2\n\nD=2, S=2, U=0\n\nD=3, S=0, U=1\n\nD=4, S= -2 no.\n\nSo (U,D,S) = (0,2,2) or (1,3,0)\n\nNow, for min H, I should choose the way that allows me to reach y=9 faster.\n\ny=1 at turn54 is closer to 9 than y=0, so better to be at y=1.\n\nSo let's aim for y=1 at turn54.\n\nWith actions: either (U,D,S) = (0,1,3) or (1,2,1) for the four actions.\n\nIn terms of sequence, I need to specify when.\n\nBut for now, let's assume I can do it.\n\nFor example, with (0,1,3): I can do three S and one D.\n\nBut when to do D.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let's first set y at turn54 to 1.\n\nThen at turn54, I am on y=1, which is freeway 1, but at turn54, it is safe, as we said.\n\nNow, from turn54, I need to go to y=9.\n\ny=1 to y=9, need 8 steps up.\n\nBut I have to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at turn56 or turn57.\n\nAlso, turn56 and 57 are fixed.\n\nTurn54 is done, now turn55,56,57,etc.\n\nAt turn54, y=1.\n\nThen I take actions.\n\nLet me denote the turn.\n\nTurn T=54, y=1\n\nThen action a54, to y55 at turn55\n\na55 to y56 at turn56\n\na56 to y57 at turn57\n\nand so on.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nAt turn56, I must not be on y=7 or y=8.\n\nSimilarly at turn57, not on y=7 or y=8.\n\nIf I can be on y=9 at turn56 or earlier, better.\n\nBut y=9 at turn56: from turn54 y=1 to turn56 y=9.\n\nTurn54 to turn56: two actions.\n\ny from 1 to 9, need +8, but max with two actions: y56 = y54 + delta a54 + delta a55\n\nEach delta <=1, so y56 <=1+1+1=3, cannot reach 9.\n\nSimilarly, min y56=1-2=-1 not possible, so y56 between 0 and 3.\n\nCannot reach y=9 by turn56.\n\nSimilarly, by turn57: from turn54 to turn57, three actions.\n\ny57 = y54 + delta a54 + delta a55 + delta a56\n\ny54=1, y57 <=1+3=4, min y57=1-3=-2 not, so y57 <=4, cannot reach 9.\n\nTurn58: y58 = y54 + sum three deltas for a54,a55,a56, so y58 <=1+3=4, still not 9.\n\nI think I confused the turns.\n\nAt turn T, y_T.\n\nAfter actions, at turn T+1, y_{T+1} = y_T + delta a_T.\n\nSo from turn54, y54=1\n\nAfter a54, at turn55, y55 = y54 + delta a54\n\nAfter a55, at turn56, y56 = y55 + delta a55\n\nAfter a56, at turn57, y57 = y56 + delta a56\n\nAnd so on.\n\nTo have y57 =9, for example.\n\ny57 = y54 + delta a54 + delta a55 + delta a56\n\nSince each delta <=1, y57 <=1 +1+1+1=4? y57 = y54 + delta a54 + delta a55 + delta a56\n\ndelta a54, a55, a56 each contribute to the change from turn54 to55,55 to56,56 to57.\n\nSo from y54 to y57, after three actions, y57 = y54 + sum_{k=54}^{56} delta a_k\n\nMax increase 3, so y57 <=1+3=4 <9.\n\nSimilarly, to reach y=9, I need more turns.\n\nFor example, at turn58: y58 = y54 + delta a54 + delta a55 + delta a56 + delta a57\n\n=1 + sum of four deltas <=1+4=5<9\n\nTurn59: y59 = y54 + sum_{k=54}^{58} delta a_k? Let's see.\n\nAt turn54, y54\n\na54: to y55 = y54 + delta a54\n\na55: to y56 = y55 + delta a55 = y54 + delta a54 + delta a55\n\na56: to y57 = y56 + delta a56 = y54 + delta a54 + delta a55 + delta a56\n\na57: to y58 = y57 + delta a57 = y54 + sum_{k=54}^{57} delta a_k\n\nGenerally, after m actions from turn54, at turn54 + m, y_{54+m} = y54 + sum_{i=0}^{m-1} delta a_{54+i}\n\nFor y_{54+m} =9, y54=1, so 1 + sum of m deltas =9, so sum of m deltas =8.\n\nSince each delta <=1, need at least 8 U actions, so m>=8.\n\nThus, from turn54, it takes at least 8 actions to reach y=9, so I arrive at turn54 +8 = turn62.\n\nTurn54 +8 = turn62.\n\nAt turn62, y=9.\n\nBut H is the number of actions from turn50.\n\nFrom turn50 to turn54, I took 4 actions to get to turn54 at y=1.\n\nThen from turn54 to turn62, 8 actions to reach y=9 at turn62.\n\nBut at turn62, after 8 actions from turn54.\n\nTotal actions: from turn50 to turn54: 4 actions, then from turn54 to turn62: 8 actions, but the actions are a50 to a61? Let's see turns.\n\nStart turn50, after H actions, at turn50+H.\n\nAt turn50, before actions.\n\nAfter a50, turn51, y51\n\n...\nAfter a_{50+H-1}, turn50+H, y_{50+H}\n\nWe want y_{50+H} =9.\n\nIn this case, at turn54, after 4 actions from start? From turn50 to turn54.\n\nAt turn50, y50=2\n\nAfter a50, turn51, y51\n\nAfter a51, turn52, y52\n\nAfter a52, turn53, y53\n\nAfter a53, turn54, y54\n\nSo after 4 actions (a50 to a53), at turn54, y54.\n\nThen after more actions, to reach turn50+H at y=9.\n\nIf at turn54, y54=1, then to reach y=9, need 8 more steps up, so at least 8 actions.\n\nAfter a54 to a61, at turn62, y62=9.\n\nSo H = number of actions from a50 to a61, that's 12 actions? a50 to a61 is 12 actions? Indices.\n\na50, a51, a52, a53: first 4 actions, to turn54.\n\nThen a54, a55, ..., a61: that's 8 actions, to turn62.\n\na54 to a61: a54,a55,a56,a57,a58,a59,a60,a61: 8 actions, to turn62.\n\nBut the actions are a50 to a61, which is 12 actions? a50 to a61 inclusive is 12 actions: 50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61.\n\nNumber of actions: from 50 to 61 inclusive is 12 actions.\n\nAfter 12 actions, at turn50+12=62, y=9.\n\nBut earlier with straight up, I could reach by turn57 with 7 actions, but with collision.\n\nNow with 12, it's more, but I have to avoid.\n\nBut min H should be less than 12.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier from other positions.\n\nOr avoid the dangerous times differently.\n\nAnother idea: instead of going to y=1 at turn54, I could go to y=0 at turn54.\n\ny=0 at turn54.\n\nThen from y=0 to y=9, need 9 steps, so even more actions.\n\nWorse.\n\nOr, I could be on y=7 or 8 at turn54, but earlier we saw that from y=2, I cannot reach y=7 at turn54, max y=6.\n\nSo only y=0 or 1 possible at turn54 for safety.\n\nBut with H around 12, it seems large.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 before turn57, but from start, min to reach y=9 is 7 actions, at turn57.\n\nBut at turn57, if I am on y=9, safe, but in the path, I may have issues at earlier turns.\n\nIn particular, at turn54, I need to be safe.\n\nIf I can be at y=9 before turn54, but from turn50 to turn54, with 4 actions, max y=6, as before, cannot reach 9.\n\nSo I must be at turn54 on a safe row, y=0 or 1.\n\nThen from there, I need to go up.\n\nBut I also have to avoid turn56 and 57 on y=7 or 8.\n\nSince I am at y=1 at turn54, I can start going up.\n\nBut at turn56 and 57, I need to not be on y=7 or 8.\n\nSo for example, at turn56, I must be on y<=6 or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 may not be reachable yet.\n\nSimilarly at turn57.\n\nLet's plan from turn54 onwards.\n\nAt turn54, y=1 (assumed)\n\nThen I take actions to go up.\n\nBut to avoid being on y=7 at turn56 or 57, etc.\n\nTurn56 is two turns after turn54.\n\nAt turn54, y=1\n\nAfter a54, turn55, y55 = y54 + delta a54\n\nAfter a55, turn56, y56 = y55 + delta a55\n\nAt turn56, I must not be on y=7 or y=8.\n\nSimilarly, after a56, turn57, y57 = y56 + delta a56\n\nAt turn57, not on y=7 or 8.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nSuppose I go up as fast as possible from turn54.\n\na54=U, turn55, y=2\n\na55=U, turn56, y=3\n\na56=U, turn57, y=4\n\na57=U, turn58, y=5\n\nand so on, to y=9 at turn62, as before.\n\nAt turn56, y=3, which is not 7 or 8, so safe.\n\nAt turn57, y=4, not 7 or 8, safe.\n\nNo problem with 56 and 57 because y is low.\n\nBut I reach at turn62, which is late.\n\nCan I reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if I start from higher y at turn54, but y=1 is low.\n\nOr if I was at y=0, even lower.\n\nBut I have to be at y=1 or 0 at turn54.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=1 at turn54 but with fewer actions, but I have to take 4 actions to get to turn54 from turn50.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps I don't need to be at safe row at turn54; I can be on a row that is not dangerous at that time.\n\nBut at turn54, all rows from 2 to 6 are dangerous, so I must be on 0,1,7,8,9, but 7,8,9 unreachable, so only 0 or 1.\n\nSo no choice.\n\nBut turn56 and 57 are later, and since I am going up from low y, I am not on high y at 56 and 57, so no issue.\n\nBut H is large.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 later but with fewer actions by going faster, but from y=1, I need 8 U actions, so 8 actions min, arriving at turn62.\n\nTotal actions from turn50: 4 to get to turn54 at y=1, plus 8 to y=9, but the 4 actions include some S or D, so not all U, so the net progress is less.\n\nIn the 4 actions to get to y=1 at turn54, I have net -1, so I wasted some actions compared to going up.\n\nFor example, if I could go straight up, from turn50 to turn54, I could be at y=6, but I am at y=1, so I lost 5 in y, so I need extra 5 actions to compensate, roughly.\n\nFrom y=6 at turn54, I can go to y=9 in 3 actions, at turn57.\n\nBut at turn54, y=6 is dangerous, so I can't be there.\n\nWith y=1 at turn54, to y=9 in 8 actions.\n\nBut at turn54, if I were at y=6 and safe, I could reach faster, but it's not safe.\n\nPerhaps I can be at a safe row at turn54 and then go fast.\n\nBut y=1 is the highest safe I can be.\n\nAnother thought: freeway 7 and 8 are safe at turn54, but I can't reach them from y=2 in 4 actions.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid the turn54 collision by being on y=0 or 1 at turn54, and then go up, but I have to deal with turn56 and 57.\n\nBut as above, with low y at 56 and 57, it's fine.\n\nBut let's calculate min H.\n\nFrom turn50 to turn54: 4 actions to reach y=1 at turn54.\n\nFor example, with (U,D,S) = (0,1,3) or (1,2,1)\n\nTo min H, I should use as many U as possible, but net I need to decrease, so I have to have D or S.\n\nWith (1,2,1): I can have one U, two D, one S, net U-D=1-2= -1, so y from 2 to 1.\n\nBut with U, I go up then down, but it might not be efficient, but in terms of number of actions, it's the same 4 actions.\n\nSimilarly for other.\n\nThen from turn54 y=1, I need 8 U actions to reach y=9 at turn62.\n\nSo actions: a50 to a61, 12 actions.\n\nBut at turn62, y=9.\n\nH=12.\n\nBut is this minimal? Perhaps I can reach earlier by being at y=0 at turn54 or something, but y=0 is lower, so even worse.\n\nOr, perhaps I can be at turn54 at y=1, but then from there, if I go faster, but I can't, because each step only +1.\n\nUnless I start from higher, but I can't.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps I don't need to take 4 actions to get to turn54; I can arrive at turn54 at y=1 by moving directly.\n\nFor example, from turn50 y=2, I can go down to y=1 at turn51, then stay for three turns to turn54 at y=1.\n\nBut that takes actions: a50=D, to turn51 y=1; then a51=S, turn52 y=1; a52=S, turn53 y=1; a53=S, turn54 y=1. So four actions, same as before.\n\nWith (1,2,1): for example, a50=U, turn51 y=3; a51=D, turn52 y=2; a52=D, turn53 y=1; a53=S, turn54 y=1. Still four actions.\n\nNo saving.\n\nThen from turn54 y=1, a54=U, turn55 y=2; a55=U, turn56 y=3; a56=U, turn57 y=4; a57=U, turn58 y=5; a58=U, turn59 y=6; a59=U, turn60 y=7; a60=U, turn61 y=8; a61=U, turn62 y=9.\n\nAt turn56, y=3, not 7 or 8, safe; turn57, y=4, safe.\n\nNo collision.\n\nH=12 actions.\n\nBut earlier with straight up, I could have reached at turn57 with 7 actions, but with collision at turn54 and 56.\n\nSo to avoid, I need more turns.\n\nBut perhaps I can reach at turn57 with y=9 by a different path that avoids the dangerous points.\n\nFor example, at turn54, if I am not on dangerous row.\n\nBut as above, I must be on 0 or 1.\n\nOr, I could be on y=7 or 8 at turn54, but impossible from start in 4 actions.\n\nAnother thought: turn56 and 57 are dangerous for y=7 and 8, but if I can be on y=7 or 8 at turn55 or turn58, safe.\n\nFor example, at turn55, freeway 7 is safe, since dangerous only at 56 and 57.\n\nSimilarly, at turn58, safe.\n\nBut in the straight up path, at turn55, y=7, which is safe, because turn55 is not 56 or 57.\n\nIn my earlier straight up sequence:\n\nTurn 50: y=2\n\nAfter U, turn51: y=3\n\nU, turn52: y=4\n\nU, turn53: y=5\n\nU, turn54: y=6 → collision at turn54\n\nBut if at turn53, I am at y=5, instead of going U to y=6 at turn54, I could go S or D.\n\nFor example, at turn53, y=5, I take a53=S, then at turn54, y=5, but freeway 5 is dangerous at T=54, so collision at turn54 on y=5.\n\nIf I take a53=D, to y=4 at turn54, freeway 4 dangerous at T=54, collision.\n\nSo if at turn53 I am on y=5, and turn54 must be on y=4,5, or6 if I move, all dangerous, so I will collide at turn54 no matter what, because I am on a freeway between 2 and 6.\n\nUnless I can be on y=1 or 0 at turn54, but from turn53 y=5, to reach y=1 in one action, I need D four times, but only one action, so I can go to y=4 at turn54, which is dangerous, or y=5 if S, dangerous, or y=6 if U, dangerous. No way to reach y=1 in one step.\n\nSo from turn53, with y=5, I cannot be at safe row at turn54 with one action.\n\nTherefore, to avoid collision at turn54, I must not be on a row between 2 and 6 at turn53, because from there, at turn54 I will be on adjacent row, all of which are dangerous at turn54.\n\nAt turn53, if I am on y=1, then at turn54 I can be on y=0,1, or2 by action.\n\ny=0 or 1 are safe at turn54, y=2 is dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, if on y=7, I can be on y=6,7,8; y=6 dangerous, y=7 safe at turn54, y=8 safe.\n\nBut from start, at turn53, what can I be?\n\nTurn53 is after 3 actions from turn50.\n\ny53 = y50 + sum_{k=50}^{52} delta a_k = 2 + sum of three deltas.\n\ny53 between max(0,2-3)=0 and min(9,2+3)=5.\n\nSo y53 can be 0 to 5.\n\nIf y53=1, then at turn54, I can go to y=0,1, or2.\n\ny=0 or1 safe, y=2 dangerous.\n\nSo I can choose to go to y=0 or y=1 at turn54.\n\nSimilarly, if y53=0, I can go to y=0 or1 at turn54.\n\nIf y53=5, I can only go to y=4,5,6, all dangerous.\n\nSo to have a choice at turn53, I need to be on y=0 or1 at turn53.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 at turn53 is possible.\n\nFor example, from turn50 y=2, I can go down to y=1 at turn51, then stay or something.\n\nLet's set to be at y=1 at turn53.\n\nThen from there, I can go to y=1 or y=0 or y=2 at turn54.\n\nTo be safe at turn54, I can go to y=1 or y=0.\n\nSay y=1 at turn54.\n\nThen from turn50 to turn53, 3 actions to reach y=1.\n\ny53=1.\n\nFrom y50=2 to y53=1, net change -1 in 3 actions.\n\nSum of three deltas = -1.\n\nPossible: (U,D,S) = (0,1,2) or (1,2,0)\n\nFor example, a50=D, to turn51 y=1; then a51=S, turn52 y=1; a52=S, turn53 y=1.\n\nThen at turn53, y=1.\n\nThen a53=S, to turn54 y=1, safe.\n\nOr a53=D, to y=0 at turn54, safe.\n\nOr a53=U, to y=2 at turn54, dangerous, not good.\n\nSo I can do a53=S or D.\n\nNow, at turn54, y=1.\n\nThen I need to go to y=9.\n\nBut I also have to avoid turn56 and 57 on y=7 or 8.\n\nWith y=1 at turn54, I can go up.\n\nTurn54: y=1\n\na54=U, turn55 y=2\n\na55=U, turn56 y=3\n\na56=U, turn57 y=4\n\na57=U, turn58 y=5\n\netc.\n\nAt turn56, y=3, not 7 or 8, safe; turn57, y=4, safe.\n\nTo reach y=9, I need to go from y=1 to y=9, 8 steps, so at turn54+8= turn62, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from turn50 to turn53, 3 actions to reach turn53 at y=1.\n\nThen from turn54 to turn62, 8 actions to reach turn62 at y=9.\n\nBut the actions are a50 to a61 for turn62? Let's see.\n\nAt turn50, before action.\n\nAfter a50, turn51\n\na51, turn52\n\na52, turn53\n\nAfter 3 actions, at turn53.\n\nThen a53, to turn54\n\na54, to turn55\n\n...\n\nup to a61, to turn62.\n\nSo actions a50 to a61, that's 12 actions, same as before.\n\na50 to a61 is 12 actions, to turn62.\n\nWith 3 actions to turn53, then a53 to a61 is 9 actions? a53 to a61 is 9 actions: a53,a54,...,a61.\n\nTurn after a53 is turn54, after a54 turn55, ..., after a61 turn62.\n\nSo from turn50 to turn53: 3 actions (a50,a51,a52)\n\nThen from turn53 to turn62: 9 actions (a53 to a61), but a53 is included.\n\nTotal actions: a50 to a61, 12 actions.\n\nBut at turn53, I am at y=1, after 3 actions from start.\n\nThen with a53, I go to turn54 y=1 or 0.\n\nThen 8 more U actions to y=9 at turn62.\n\nSame as before.\n\nCan I reach faster?\n\nFor example, if at turn54 I am at y=1, but then I go up, but to be at high y at turn56 or 57, but I need to avoid y=7 and 8 there.\n\nBut since I start from low y, I am low at those turns.\n\nSuppose that from turn54, I go up faster, but I can't, each step +1.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 before turn57, but impossible from start in 7 actions, as min turn to reach is 57 with 7U.\n\nBut at turn57, if I am on y=9, safe, but to be there, I need to be on the rows at earlier turns without collision.\n\nBut at turn54, I must be on safe row, which requires me to be lower earlier, so I can't be high at turn54.\n\nSo I think 12 is the best so far.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can avoid the turn56 and 57 issue with less.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps I can be on y=9 at turn57 by taking a different route that avoids the dangerous times.\n\nFor example, if I go up but slower or faster.\n\nSuppose I go up very fast at the beginning.\n\nFrom turn50 y=2, a50=U, turn51 y=3\n\na51=U, turn52 y=4\n\na52=U, turn53 y=5\n\nNow at turn53, y=5.\n\nThen at turn53, I must take action to turn54.\n\nBut as above, any action to y=4,5,6 all dangerous at turn54.\n\nCollision inevitable if on y=5 at turn53.\n\nIf I am on y=4 at turn52, then at turn52, y=4, which is freeway 4, dangerous only at T=54, not at 52, so safe at turn52.\n\nThen a52, to turn53.\n\nIf a52=U, turn53 y=5, then as above, problem at turn54.\n\nIf a52=S, turn53 y=4, then at turn53, y=4, dangerous? Freeway 4 dangerous at T=54, not at 53, so at turn53, safe.\n\nThen at turn53, y=4, I can take a53.\n\nBut to turn54, y=3,4, or5.\n\ny=3,4,5 all dangerous at turn54, since freeways 3,4,5 dangerous at T=54.\n\nSo again, collision at turn54 if I am on y=3,4,5 at turn53.\n\nSimilarly, only if I am on y=0,1,6,7,8 at turn53, but y=6 at turn53: freeway 6 dangerous only at T=54, not at 53, so safe at turn53.\n\nBut from turn50, to turn53, y53 <=5, as before, so y=6 not possible.\n\ny=7,8 not possible.\n\ny=0 or 1 possible.\n\nSo only by being on y=0 or 1 at turn53 can I avoid collision at turn54.\n\nThen as before.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 at turn58 or something with less than 12 actions.\n\nMin actions to go from y=2 to y=9 is 7, but with constraints, more.\n\nSuppose I go to y=1 at turn51, for example.\n\nTurn50: y=2, a50=D, turn51 y=1\n\nThen at turn51, y=1, safe.\n\nThen I can stay or go up.\n\nBut I need to be safe at turn54.\n\nAt turn54, I need to be on safe row.\n\nIf I go up from turn51.\n\na51=U, turn52 y=2\n\na52=U, turn53 y=3\n\na53=U, turn54 y=4 → but at turn54 y=4 dangerous, collision.\n\nIf I stay at y=1 for some turns.\n\nFor example, from turn51 y=1, a51=S, turn52 y=1\n\na52=S, turn53 y=1\n\na53=S, turn54 y=1, safe.\n\nThen from there, same as before, need 8 U to y=9 at turn62.\n\nActions: a50=D, a51=S, a52=S, a53=S, then a54 to a61 U, 8U, to turn62 y=9.\n\na50 to a61, 12 actions.\n\nWith a50=D, then three S, then 8U.\n\nBut a50 is D, which is down, but necessary to avoid.\n\nH=12.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach earlier by going up after turn54 faster, but I can't.\n\nPerhaps I can be at high y at turn55 or later when it is safe.\n\nFor example, freeway 7 is safe at turn55, so if I can be on y=7 at turn55, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at turn58, safe.\n\nBut to be on y=7 at turn55, from start.\n\nTurn55 is after 5 actions from turn50.\n\ny55 = 2 + sum of 5 deltas <= 2+5=7, so possible to be at y=7 at turn55.\n\nSimilarly, min y=0.\n\nSo if I can be at y=7 at turn55, then from there to y=9 in 2 actions, at turn57.\n\nAnd at turn55, y=7, freeway 7, dangerous at T=56 and 57, not at 55, so safe at turn55.\n\nThen I can go U to turn56 y=8, but at turn56, y=8, dangerous, collision.\n\nIf I go U to turn56 y=8, collision.\n\nIf I stay at turn55, a55=S, turn56 y=7, but at turn56, y=7 dangerous, collision.\n\nIf I go down, to y=6 at turn56, but freeway 6 dangerous only at T=54, not at 56, so at turn56, y=6 is safe.\n\nThen from there, I can go up.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFirst, to be at y=7 at turn55.\n\nFrom y=2 at turn50, need to increase by 5 in 5 actions, so all U except possibly some S, but to reach y=7, need net +5, so 5 U actions.\n\nWith 5 actions: a50 to a54.\n\nAfter a50, turn51 y51\n\n...\nAfter a54, turn55 y55\n\ny55 = 2 + sum_{k=50}^{54} delta a_k\n\nSet equal to 7, so sum delta =5, so all a50 to a54 must be U.\n\nThen: a50=U, turn51 y=3\n\na51=U, turn52 y=4\n\na52=U, turn53 y=5\n\na53=U, turn54 y=6\n\na54=U, turn55 y=7\n\nNow, at turn54, y=6, which is dangerous at T=54, collision! At turn54, I am on y=6, freeway 6, T=54, collision.\n\nSo I cannot reach y=7 at turn55 without being on dangerous row at turn54.\n\nIf I have some S, then y55<7, not 7.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=7 at turn55 with no collision.\n\nSimilarly for other high rows.\n\nTherefore, the only way is to be low at turn54 and go up later.\n\nThus, minimal H is 12, with arrival at turn62.\n\nBut let's confirm the sequence.\n\nAlso, I need to output the actions from t1=50.\n\nAnd for turn56 and 57, since I am at low y, no issue.\n\nIn the sequence, when I go up from turn54, at some point I may hit turn56 or 57 on high y, but in the slow rise, I am at y=3 or 4 at turn56,57, safe.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach faster by being at higher y at turn54.\n\nBut I can't.\n\nPerhaps with H=11 or less.\n\nSuppose I reach y=9 at turn61.\n\nTurn61 is 50+11, so after 11 actions.\n\nAt turn50, y=2.\n\nAfter 11 actions, turn61, y=9.\n\nSo net increase 7, from 2 to 9.\n\nSum of 11 deltas =7.\n\nNumber of U minus number of D =7, and U + D + S =11.\n\nU - D =7, U + D + S =11.\n\nAdd: 2U + S =18, so U <=9.\n\nSubtract: 2D + S =4.\n\nD >=0.\n\nIf D=0, S=4, U=7\n\nIf D=1, S=2, U=8\n\nIf D=2, S=0, U=9\n\nNow, I need to avoid collision at turn54 and at turn56,57.\n\nAt turn54, I must be on y=0 or 1.\n\ny54 = 2 + sum_{k=50}^{53} delta a_k\n\nWith 4 actions, y54 between 0 and 6.\n\nTo be 0 or 1.\n\nSimilarly, at turn56, I must not be on y=7 or 8.\n\ny56 = 2 + sum_{k=50}^{55} delta a_k\n\nWith 6 actions, y56 between 0 and 8.\n\nTo not be 7 or 8.\n\nSimilarly for turn57.\n\nNow, suppose I want y54=1.\n\nThen sum_{50}^{53} delta = -1.\n\nAs before.\n\nThen from there, I need to reach y=9 at turn61.\n\ny61 = y54 + sum_{k=54}^{60} delta a_k\n\ny54=1, y61=9, so sum_{k=54}^{60} delta a_k =8\n\n7 actions: a54 to a60, to reach turn61.\n\n7 actions, sum delta=8, impossible, max 7.\n\ny61 = after a60, turn61.\n\nactions a54 to a60: 7 actions.\n\ny61 = y54 + sum_{i=54}^{60} delta a_i\n\n=1 + sum of 7 deltas <=1+7=8 <9, cannot reach y=9.\n\nIf y54=0, y61=0 + sum <=7, max 7<9.\n\nSo impossible to reach y=9 at turn61 from y=1 at turn54 with 7 actions.\n\nSimilarly for turn60: y60=9, but turn60 is after 10 actions from start.\n\ny60 = 2 + sum_{k=50}^{59} delta a_k\n\nSet to 9, so sum=7.\n\n10 actions, sum delta=7, possible, e.g., 7U,3S or 8U,2D, etc.\n\nBut at turn54, y54 must be 0 or 1.\n\ny54 = 2 + sum_{k=50}^{53} delta a_k\n\nWith 4 actions, to be 0 or 1, so sum delta = -2 or -1.\n\nThen y60 = y54 + sum_{k=54}^{59} delta a_k\n\ny54 <=1, sum_{54}^{59} delta <=6 (6 actions), so y60 <=1+6=7<9, cannot reach 9.\n\nIf y54=1, y60<=7<9.\n\nSo impossible to reach y=9 by turn60.\n\nTurn61: y61=2 + sum_{50}^{60} delta, 11 actions, set to 9, sum=7.\n\ny54=2 + sum_{50}^{53} delta, must be <=1, so sum_{50}^{53} delta <= -1.\n\nThen y61 = y54 + sum_{54}^{60} delta a_i\n\ny54 <=1, sum_{54}^{60} delta <=7, y61<=1+7=8<9.\n\nIf y54=1, y61<=1+7=8<9.\n\nIf y54=0, y61<=0+7=7<9.\n\nSo cannot reach y=9 by turn61.\n\nTurn62: y62=2 + sum_{50}^{61} delta, 12 actions, set to 9, sum=7.\n\ny54=2 + sum_{50}^{53} delta <=1, so sum_{50}^{53} delta <= -1.\n\nThen y62 = y54 + sum_{54}^{61} delta a_i\n\ny54 <=1, sum_{54}^{61} delta <=8, y62<=1+8=9, so possible if y54=1 and sum_{54}^{61} delta=8, all U.\n\nSimilarly, if y54=0, y62<=0+8=8<9, not possible, so must have y54=1 and then 8 U from a54 to a61.\n\nSimilarly, for the actions to turn54.\n\nSo minimal H is 12, with y54=1 and then 8U.\n\nNow, for the actions to reach y=1 at turn54 with net -1 in 4 actions.\n\nFor example, with (U,D,S)=(0,1,3) or (1,2,1)\n\nTo have fewer D or something, but since we go up later, it doesn't matter.\n\nI can choose (0,1,3) to have only one D.\n\nFor example: a50=S, a51=S, a52=S, a53=D, then at turn54 y=2 + 0+0+0-1=1? y54 after a53.\n\nAt turn50: y=2\n\na50=S, turn51 y=2\n\na51=S, turn52 y=2\n\na52=S, turn53 y=2\n\na53=D, turn54 y=1\n\nYes.\n\na50=D, turn51 y=1; then a51=S, a52=S, a53=S, turn54 y=1.\n\nOr other sequences.\n\nThen from a54=U, turn55 y=2\n\na55=U, turn56 y=3\n\na56=U, turn57 y=4\n\na57=U, turn58 y=5\n\na58=U, turn59 y=6\n\na59=U, turn60 y=7\n\na60=U, turn61 y=8\n\na61=U, turn62 y=9\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nTurn50: y=2, freeway 2, dangerous only at T=54, not 50, safe.\n\nTurn51: y=2 (if a50=S), freeway 2, not dangerous at 51, safe.\n\nSimilarly turn52: y=2, safe.\n\nTurn53: y=2, freeway 2, dangerous only at 54, not 53, safe.\n\nTurn54: y=1, freeway 1, not dangerous at 54 (dangerous at 64-67), safe.\n\nTurn55: y=2, freeway 2, not dangerous at 55, safe.\n\nTurn56: y=3, freeway 3, dangerous only at 54, not 56, safe.\n\nTurn57: y=4, freeway 4, dangerous only at 54, not 57, safe.\n\nTurn58: y=5, freeway 5, dangerous only at 54, not 58, safe.\n\nTurn59: y=6, freeway 6, dangerous only at 54, not 59, safe.\n\nTurn60: y=7, freeway 7, dangerous at 56 and 57, not 60, safe.\n\nTurn61: y=8, freeway 8, dangerous at 56 and 57, not 61, safe.\n\nTurn62: y=9, safe.\n\nAll safe.\n\nH=12.\n\nBut is there a way with H=11?\n\nAs above, impossible to reach by turn61.\n\nSimilarly for earlier.\n\nThus minimal H is 12.\n\nBut in the sequence above, at turn56, y=3, which is fine.\n\nNow, for the action sequence.\n\nt1=50.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 50: S (if I choose the first sequence)\n\nIn the sequence I have a50=S, but I could do a50=D directly.\n\nBut both fine.\n\nTo save, but no.\n\nIn the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nAlso, for freeway 7 and 8, dangerous at 56 and 57, but I am not on them at those times.\n\nIn my sequence, at turn56, I am on y=3, not 7 or 8.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nBut let's see if I can start going up earlier.\n\nSuppose I do a50=D to go to y=1 at turn51.\n\nThen I can go up from there, but I need to be at turn54 at y=1.\n\nFor example:\n\na50=D, turn51 y=1\n\nThen to stay at y=1 until turn54, I need a51=S, a52=S, a53=S, turn54 y=1.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nFrom turn51, if I go up, I will be higher at turn54, but then dangerous.\n\nFor example, a50=D, turn51 y=1\n\na51=U, turn52 y=2\n\na52=U, turn53 y=3\n\na53=U, turn54 y=4 → dangerous at turn54.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo I must stay low until after turn54.\n\nThus, the sequence is fixed.\n\nSo minimal H=12.\n\nNow, for the actions, I can choose.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 50: D  (to go down to y=1)\n\nTurn 51: S  (stay at y=1)\n\nTurn 52: S  (stay)\n\nTurn 53: S  (stay, turn54 y=1)\n\nThen Turn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: U\n\nTurn 57: U\n\nTurn 58: U\n\nTurn 59: U\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: U\n\nAt turn61, y=8, after a61=U, turn62 y=9.\n\nActions up to a61.\n\nIn the sequence, a50 to a11 actions? a50 to a61 is 12 actions.\n\nList:\n\nTurn 50: a_{50} = D\n\nTurn 51: a_{51} = S\n\nTurn 52: a_{52} = S\n\nTurn 53: a_{53} = S\n\nTurn 54: a_{54} = U\n\nTurn 55: a_{55} = U\n\nTurn 56: a_{56} = U\n\nTurn 57: a_{57} = U\n\nTurn 58: a_{58} = U\n\nTurn 59: a_{59} = U\n\nTurn 60: a_{60} = U\n\nTurn 61: a_{61} = U\n\nThen at turn 62, y=9.\n\nH=12 actions.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be from turn t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nt1=50.\n\nActions: a_{50} to a_{61}, that's 12 actions.\n\nIn the box.\n\nTo have fewer S, but not necessary.\n\nWith (1,2,1) for the first part, but it might have extra moves.\n\nFor example: a50=U, turn51 y=3\n\na51=D, turn52 y=2\n\na52=D, turn53 y=1\n\na53=S, turn54 y=1\n\nThen same up.\n\nBut here I went to y=3 and back, but same number of actions.\n\nSo the first sequence is fine.\n\nNow, about turn56 and 57: in the sequence, at turn56, I am on y=3, which is fine, no car.\n\nSimilarly turn57 y=4.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo I think this is the minimal.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 6, there is a second car, but we saw it never causes collision.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo output the sequence.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 50\\), while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), is 12. This sequence ensures the player is not on any dangerous freeway at critical turns, specifically avoiding:\n- Freeways \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 54 (all dangerous due to cars at \\(x=0\\)).\n- Freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) at turns 56 and 57 (dangerous due to cars at \\(x=0\\)).\n\nThe sequence of actions is designed to:\n- Move down to \\(y = 1\\) by turn 51 and stay there until turn 54 to avoid the turn 54 collision.\n- From turn 54 onwards, move up steadily to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 62, avoiding the turns 56 and 57 collisions by being on lower freeways (\\(y = 3\\) and \\(y = 4\\)) at those turns, which are safe.\n\n**Action Sequence:**\n- At turn 50, action \\(D\\) (down) moves to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 51.\n- Actions \\(S\\) (stay) at turns 51, 52, and 53 keep the player at \\(y = 1\\) until turn 54, safe from collisions.\n- From turn 54 to turn 61, actions \\(U\\) (up) increment \\(y\\) by 1 each turn, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 62.\n\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_t\\}\\) for \\(t = 50\\) to \\(t = 61\\) is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 50: a_{50} = D \\\\\nTurn 51: a_{51} = S \\\\\nTurn 52: a_{52} = S \\\\\nTurn 53: a_{53} = S \\\\\nTurn 54: a_{54} = U \\\\\nTurn 55: a_{55} = U \\\\\nTurn 56: a_{56} = U \\\\\nTurn 57: a_{57} = U \\\\\nTurn 58: a_{58} = U \\\\\nTurn 59: a_{59} = U \\\\\nTurn 60: a_{60} = U \\\\\nTurn 61: a_{61} = U\n}\n\nAfter these 12 actions, at turn 62, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) with no collisions. The \\(y\\) values and safety at each turn are:\n- Turn 50: \\(y = 2\\) (safe, freeway 2 not dangerous at turn 50)\n- Turn 51: \\(y = 1\\) (safe, freeway 1 not dangerous at turn 51)\n- Turn 52: \\(y = 1\\) (safe)\n- Turn 53: \\(y = 1\\) (safe)\n- Turn 54: \\(y = 1\\) (safe, freeway 1 not dangerous at turn 54)\n- Turn 55: \\(y = 2\\) (safe, freeway 2 not dangerous at turn 55)\n- Turn 56: \\(y = 3\\) (safe, freeway 3 not dangerous at turn 56)\n- Turn 57: \\(y = 4\\) (safe, freeway 4 not dangerous at turn 57)\n- Turn 58: \\(y = 5\\) (safe, freeway 5 not dangerous at turn 58)\n- Turn 59: \\(y = 6\\) (safe, freeway 6 not dangerous at turn 59)\n- Turn 60: \\(y = 7\\) (safe, freeway 7 not dangerous at turn 60)\n- Turn 61: \\(y = 8\\) (safe, freeway 8 not dangerous at turn 61)\n- Turn 62: \\(y = 9\\) (goal, safe)\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in the minimal \\(H = 12\\) turns.",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 through 8. The player can move up, down, or stay each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision happens if at any turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where y_T is between 1 and 8, and at that exact turn, there is a car on that freeway such that x=0 is within the car's span. The car positions move over time based on their speed and direction.\n\nThe key point is that when you move to a new y, you are not on that new y until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T you are still on y, and you arrive at y+1 at turn T+1. So for collision, at turn T, you are on y_T, and you check if there is a car on freeway y_T such that at turn T, x=0 is in its span.\n\nAlso, for the car spans, they move continuously with time. Left-moving cars have decreasing x, right-moving have increasing x.\n\nNow, let's list all the cars for each freeway at turn t_1 = 54.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nDirection is right, so it's moving right, so head is at -48, tail at -59? That seems backwards. Typically head is the front, so for right-moving, head should be larger, but here it says head -48, tail -59, and direction right. -48 is greater than -59, so if it's moving right, head should be at the right end, so if head is -48 and tail is -59, since -48 > -59, that means tail is left, head is right, so as it moves right, both increase.\n\nThe span is given as (head, tail), and for right-moving, span is [τ, h] where τ is tail, h is head, and τ < h since moving right.\n\nIn the car state, it says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, it should be head > tail.\n\nHere, for freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3). -48 > -59, so head = -48, tail = -59, direction right, speed 3.\n\nSimilarly, for others.\n\nFreeway 2: (48, 37, right, 12) — head=48, tail=37, 48>37, so head right, tail left.\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2, (48,37,right,12)\n\nFreeway 4: same\n\nFreeway 5: same\n\nFreeway 6: two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst car: head=48, tail=37, right, speed 12\n\nSecond car: head=0, tail=-11, right, speed 12\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nFirst: head=-48, tail=-59, right, speed 6\n\nSecond: head=0, tail=-11, right, speed 6\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nNow, the player starts at (0,0) at turn 54. y=0 is not a freeway, so no cars there, so it's safe. But we need to go to y=9, which is also not a freeway, I assume, since freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), and y=9 is not a freeway, so no cars to worry about there.\n\nNow, we need to move up through the freeways without being at a y where a car is at x=0 at that turn.\n\nEach action takes one turn, and we change y only by one step per turn, so to go from y=0 to y=9, minimum turns is 9, if we go up every turn. But we might have to wait or go down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 9.\n\nBut we want minimal H, so we should try to go up as fast as possible, only deviating when necessary.\n\nFirst, let's model the car positions over time.\n\nSince the cars move with constant speed, we can find when a car has x=0 in its span for a given freeway.\n\nFor a car on freeway k, at turn T, the span depends on the initial span at t1=54 and the elapsed time τ = T - 54.\n\nLet τ = T - t1, so at time τ, from turn 54.\n\nFor a right-moving car with head h, tail t, speed s, at time τ, the span is [t + s*τ, h + s*τ] because it moves right, so tail increases, head increases.\n\nSimilarly, left-moving would be [h - s*τ, t - s*τ], but all cars here are right-moving, no left-moving, I think.\n\nLooking at the directions, all are \"right\", so all moving right.\n\nFreeway 1: right, freeway 2-8 all right, so all cars moving right.\n\nSo for any car, at time τ, position of tail: initial tail + s*τ\n\nPosition of head: initial head + s*τ\n\nAnd the span is [min(tail, head), max(tail, head)] but since for right-moving, head > tail, so span is [tail + s*τ, head + s*τ]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here no left.\n\nSo collision on freeway k at turn T if player is on y=k at turn T, and for some car on freeway k, x=0 is in [tail + s*τ, head + s*τ] for τ = T - 54.\n\nx=0 in [tail + s*τ, head + s*τ] means tail + s*τ ≤ 0 ≤ head + s*τ\n\nSince head > tail.\n\nSo we can solve for τ when this happens for each car.\n\nAlso, since multiple cars per freeway, we need to check for any car on that row.\n\nNow, player position: at turn T, y_T depends on the actions from t1.\n\nWe start at t1=54, y=0.\n\nAfter action at t1, y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy, but at turn T, we are at y_T.\n\nLet me denote the turn from t1 onwards.\n\nSet t = 0 at relative turn, so at relative turn 0, which is t1=54, position (0,0)\n\nThen at relative turn t, the absolute turn is t1 + t.\n\nPosition y_t, with y_0 = 0.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nBut at turn relative t, we are at y_t.\n\nCollision at turn relative t if y_t between 1 and 8, and for freeway k=y_t, there is a car such that 0 is in [τ_i + s_i * t, h_i + s_i * t] for that car, where τ_i and h_i are initial tail and head at t=0 (t1=54).\n\nτ = t, since relative time.\n\nt is relative turn count from t1.\n\nNow, for each freeway, let's list the cars and find when x=0 is covered.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car: tail = -59, head = -48, s=3, direction right.\n\nSpan at time t: [ -59 + 3t , -48 + 3t ]\n\nx=0 in this if -59 + 3t ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 3t\n\nSo -59 + 3t ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -48 + 3t\n\nFirst inequality: -59 + 3t ≤ 0 => 3t ≤ 59 => t ≤ 59/3 ≈ 19.666, so t ≤ 19 since t integer? t is turn, so integer.\n\nt is integer, turns are discrete.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 ≤ -48 + 3t => 48 ≤ 3t => t ≥ 16\n\nSo t ≥ 16 and t ≤ 19\n\nThus for freeway 1, car covers x=0 at t=16,17,18,19\n\nNow, only one car on freeway 1, so freeway 1 is dangerous at t=16,17,18,19 relative to t1.\n\nt relative, from 0.\n\nAt t=0, it's turn 54, etc.\n\nNow freeway 2: one car: tail=37, head=48, s=12\n\nSpan: [37 + 12t, 48 + 12t]\n\nx=0 in this? 37 + 12t ≤ 0 ≤ 48 + 12t\n\nBut 37 + 12t ≤ 0? 37 + 12t is at least 37>0 for t≥0, so always positive, never ≤0, so 0 not in span for any t. Similarly, 48+12t >0 always. So freeway 2 is always safe, no car at x=0 ever.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, one car (48,37,right,12), same thing, always safe.\n\nFreeway 4: same, always safe.\n\nFreeway 5: same, always safe.\n\nNow freeway 6: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12) same as above, span [37+12t, 48+12t] always >0, so x=0 never covered.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12) head=0, tail=-11, s=12\n\nSpan: [ -11 + 12t , 0 + 12t ] = [ -11 + 12t , 12t ]\n\nx=0 in this if -11 + 12t ≤ 0 ≤ 12t\n\nWhich is always true for t≥1? Let's see:\n\n-11 + 12t ≤ 0 => 12t ≤ 11 => t ≤ 11/12 ≈ 0.916, so for t≤0, but t≥0, t=0: -11 ≤0≤0? 0≤12*0=0, yes 0≤0, and -11≤0, so at t=0, x=0 is in [ -11, 0 ]? head=0, tail=-11, so [ -11, 0 ], so x=0 is the head, so included.\n\nAt t=0, τ=0, span [ -11 +0, 0+0] = [-11,0], so 0 is included.\n\nNow, -11 +12t ≤0 and 0 ≤12t.\n\nFirst: -11 +12t ≤0 => t ≤ 11/12, so for t=0 only since t integer.\n\nt=0: -11 +0 = -11 ≤0, and 0≤0, yes.\n\nt=1: -11+12=1 ≤0? 1≤0 false, so not.\n\n0 ≤12t always for t≥0.\n\nSo only at t=0, x=0 is covered for this car on freeway 6.\n\nt=0 relative, which is turn t1=54.\n\nBut at t=0, player is at y=0, not on freeway 6, so no issue. Player is on freeway only when y between 1-8.\n\nAt turn t=0, player at (0,0), y=0, not on freeway, so no collision possible.\n\nFor t≥1, the car has moved, span [ -11+12t, 12t ], for t=1, [1,12], x=0 not in, and for t>1, even higher, so never again. So freeway 6 is safe except at t=0, but t=0 not relevant for player on freeway.\n\nThus freeway 6 is always safe for player, since when player can be on y=6, t≥1, no car at x=0.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,6) tail=-59, head=-48, s=6\n\nSpan: [ -59 +6t , -48 +6t ]\n\nx=0 in this if -59+6t ≤0 ≤ -48+6t\n\nSo -59+6t ≤0 => 6t ≤59 => t≤59/6≈9.833, t≤9\n\nAnd 0≤ -48+6t => 48≤6t => t≥8\n\nSo t≥8 and t≤9, so t=8,9\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,6) head=0, tail=-11, s=6\n\nSpan: [ -11 +6t , 0 +6t ] = [ -11+6t, 6t ]\n\nx=0 in this if -11+6t ≤0 ≤6t\n\n-11+6t ≤0 => 6t≤11 => t≤11/6≈1.833, t≤1\n\nAnd 0≤6t always for t≥0.\n\nSo for t=0: -11≤0≤0, yes\n\nt=1: -11+6=-5≤0≤6, 0≤6 yes, and -5≤0 true, so x=0 in [-5,6], yes.\n\nt=2: -11+12=1≤0? 1≤0 false, not.\n\nSo only t=0 and t=1.\n\nBut t=0 not relevant.\n\nThus for second car, x=0 covered at t=1 relative.\n\nNow for freeway 7, at time t, collision if either car has x=0 covered.\n\nFirst car covers at t=8,9\n\nSecond car at t=1\n\nSo freeway 7 dangerous at t=1,8,9\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same as freeway 7, two cars: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6), same as above.\n\nSo dangerous at t=1,8,9\n\nNow, freeway 1 dangerous at t=16,17,18,19\n\nFreeway 2,3,4,5 always safe\n\nFreeway 6 always safe\n\nFreeway 7 dangerous at t=1,8,9\n\nFreeway 8 dangerous at t=1,8,9\n\nPlayer starts at y=0 at t=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn H.\n\ny must be integer, and we move step by step.\n\nTo minimize H, we should go up as much as possible, but avoid being on a dangerous freeway at dangerous times.\n\nSince we start at y=0, and need to go to y=9, we can only go up or down one per turn.\n\nThe critical points are when we cross the freeways.\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t.\n\nIf we go up, at turn t, we are at y_t, and at turn t+1, we are at y_t +1.\n\nCollision only when on freeway, so when y_t between 1 and 8.\n\nWe need to ensure that for each turn t, if y_t is between 1 and 8, it is not a dangerous time for that freeway.\n\ny_t is the freeway number at turn t.\n\nNow, let's list the dangerous times for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: dangerous at t=16,17,18,19\n\nFreeway 2: always safe\n\nFreeway 3: always safe\n\nFreeway 4: always safe\n\nFreeway 5: always safe\n\nFreeway 6: always safe (as we saw)\n\nFreeway 7: dangerous at t=1,8,9\n\nFreeway 8: dangerous at t=1,8,9\n\nt=1,8,9 relative to start.\n\nNow, player at t=0: y=0, safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=2,3,4,5,6 are always safe, no problem to be there at any time.\n\ny=1 is dangerous only at t=16-19, but since we might not be there long, we can avoid those times.\n\ny=7 and y=8 are dangerous at t=1,8,9.\n\nt=1 is early, t=8,9 later.\n\nTo go up, we start from y=0.\n\nAt t=0, we are at y=0.\n\nWe can choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf we go U at t=0, then at t=1, y=1.\n\nIf we go S, at t=1, still y=0.\n\nIf D, y=-1, but y=0 is min, so y cannot go below 0, I assume. The player update says y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if at y=0 and D, probably y stays 0, or goes to 0? The delta: if a_t=D, Δy_t = -1 if possible, but since y min 0, if y_t=0 and a_t=D, then y_{t+1} = max(0, y_t -1) =0.\n\nSimilarly for y=9 and U, stays 9.\n\nSo effectively, at boundaries, D or U may not change y.\n\nBut in terms of position, at turn t, y_t is given.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nThe shortest path is to go up 9 times in a row, but we need to check if we can do that without collision.\n\nStart: t=0, y=0\n\nAction a_0: if U, then at t=1, y=1\n\nAt t=1, y=1, which is freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1 dangerous only at t=16-19, but t=1 is not in 16-19, so safe? t=1 is early, not dangerous for y=1.\n\nFreeway 1 dangerous at t=16-19, so at t=1, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, if we go up to y=2 at t=2, etc.\n\nBut we have y=7 and y=8 dangerous at t=1,8,9.\n\nt=1 is soon.\n\nSuppose we go up every turn.\n\nSequence:\n\nt=0: y=0\n\na_0: U → y_1=1\n\nt=1: y=1, freeway 1, at time t=1, not dangerous (dangerous only at t=16-19), so safe.\n\na_1: U → y_2=2\n\nt=2: y=2, freeway 2, always safe\n\na_2: U → y_3=3, freeway 3, safe\n\na_3: U → y_4=4, freeway 4, safe\n\na_4: U → y_5=5, freeway 5, safe\n\na_5: U → y_6=6, freeway 6, safe\n\na_6: U → y_7=7, freeway 7\n\nNow at t=6, y=7\n\nt=6 relative? t is the turn index.\n\nAt turn t=6, y_t=7.\n\nFreeway 7 dangerous at t=1,8,9\n\nt=6 not in {1,8,9}, so safe.\n\nThen a_6: U → y_7=8\n\nt=7: y=8, freeway 8, dangerous at t=1,8,9? t=7 not in, so safe.\n\nThen a_7: U → y_8=9\n\nt=8: y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision possible. And we reached y=9 at t=8.\n\nt=8 relative, so H=8 turns? Let's see the sequence.\n\nRelative turns: t from 0 to 7 for positions, but actions from t=0 to t=7.\n\nAt t=0: action a_{t1} , which is a_0 relative, leads to y_1\n\nSet relative t: at relative time t, we have position after t turns? Better to think of the state at turn.\n\nAt absolute turn T, position y_T.\n\nBut relative: at relative turn k, meaning after k steps from start.\n\nDefine:\n\nLet k be the number of turns elapsed since t1.\n\nAt k=0 (turn t1=54), position (0,0)\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + k} for k=0 to H-1, we reach position at k=H.\n\nPosition at step k: after k actions, we are at turn t1 + k, position y_k.\n\ny_k is the position at turn t1 + k.\n\ny_0 = 0\n\nAfter action a_0 (at turn t1), y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\nSimilarly, after action a_{k-1}, y_k = y_{k-1} + Δy_{k-1}\n\nFor k from 0 to H, y_k at turn t1+k.\n\nWe start at k=0, y_0=0\n\nEnd at k=H, y_H=9\n\nAt each turn k, if y_k between 1 and 8, must not have collision on that freeway at time k.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nk=0: y=0, safe\n\nAction U: so y_1 =1\n\nk=1: y=1, freeway 1, time k=1, dangerous times 16-19, 1 not in, so safe\n\nAction U: y_2=2\n\nk=2: y=2, freeway 2, always safe\n\nAction U: y_3=3\n\nk=3: y=3, safe\n\nAction U: y_4=4, safe\n\nAction U: y_5=5, safe\n\nAction U: y_6=6, freeway 6, safe\n\nAction U: y_7=7, freeway 7, time k=7\n\nDangerous times for freeway 7: k=1,8,9\n\nk=7 not in, so safe\n\nAction U: y_8=8\n\nk=8: y=8, freeway 8, dangerous times k=1,8,9\n\nk=8 is dangerous! Oh, problem.\n\nAt k=8, y=8, freeway 8 is dangerous at k=8, so collision.\n\nNot safe.\n\nThen if we go up to y_8=8 at k=8, it is dangerous.\n\nIn the sequence, at k=7, y=7, safe, then action U to y_8=8 at k=8, which is dangerous.\n\nIf we stay or something.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nAt k=8, if we are at y=8, and we go up, to y_9=9 at k=9.\n\nBut at k=8, if we are on y=8 and it is dangerous, collision.\n\nWe cannot be on y=8 at k=8.\n\nSimilarly, at k=9, if on y=8, it is also dangerous, since k=9 dangerous for y=8.\n\nFreeway 8 dangerous at k=1,8,9.\n\nSo we need to avoid being on y=8 at k=8 or k=9.\n\nAlso, for y=7, dangerous at k=1,8,9.\n\nIn the direct path, at k=7, y=7, which is not dangerous (k=7 not in {1,8,9}), so we can be there.\n\nBut from there, if we go up at k=7 to y_8=8 at k=8, dangerous.\n\nIf we stay at k=7, action S, then y_8=7 at k=8.\n\nAt k=8, y=7, freeway 7, dangerous at k=8? k=8 is dangerous for y=7, since freeway 7 dangerous at k=1,8,9.\n\nSo at k=8, if y=7, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down, but y=7, if D, y_8=6, then at k=8, y=6, which is safe, freeway 6 always safe.\n\nBut we are going away from goal.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, we need to go through y=8 or something.\n\nSince y=6 is always safe, we can stay there if needed.\n\nBut we need to cross y=7 and y=8.\n\nThe dangerous times for y=7 and y=8 are k=1,8,9.\n\nk=1 is early, we might not be there yet if we start from bottom.\n\nIn the first few steps, we can be at y=1 at k=1, which is safe for y=1, since dangerous only later.\n\nBut for y=7 and y=8, we need to avoid k=8 and k=9.\n\nk=10 might be safe, but let's see.\n\nFirst, let's list the times when we can be on each freeway safely.\n\nFreeway 1: safe except k=16,17,18,19. Since we start from low, and go up, we will be on y=1 early, like k=1 or so, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2-6 always safe.\n\nFreeway 7: dangerous at k=1,8,9. Safe at other times.\n\nFreeway 8: dangerous at k=1,8,9. Safe at other times.\n\nWe need to be on y=7 and y=8 at some point to go up.\n\nBut avoid k=8 and k=9 for both.\n\nAlso, k=1 for them, but k=1 is early, we might not be at y=7 or 8 at k=1, since we start from y=0.\n\nAt k=0, y=0\n\nk=1, y=1 if we go up\n\nk=2, y=2, etc.\n\nTo reach y=7, minimum k=7, if we go up all the way.\n\ny_7=7 at k=7.\n\nSimilarly, y_8=8 at k=8, but k=8 dangerous for y=8.\n\ny_9=9 at k=9, but to get to y=9, we need to be at y=8 at some k, then go up.\n\nAt k=7, y=7, which is safe since k=7 not dangerous.\n\nFrom there, if we go up at k=7, to y_8=8 at k=8, dangerous.\n\nIf we stay at k=7, action S, then y_8=7 at k=8, but k=8 dangerous for y=7.\n\nIf we go down, to y_8=6 at k=8, safe, but then we have to go up again.\n\nThen at later time, go up.\n\nBut we need to avoid k=8 and k=9 for y=7 and y=8.\n\nSo possible to be on y=7 at k=10, for example.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nSince freeway 7 and 8 have the same dangerous times, we can treat them similarly.\n\nNow, the lower freeways are safe.\n\nWe can go up to y=6 quickly, since y=1 to 6 all safe at early times.\n\ny=6 is always safe, so we can be at y=6 at any time.\n\nThen from there, go to y=7 and y=8 when safe.\n\nDangerous times for y=7 and y=8: k=1,8,9.\n\nSafe times: k=0? k=0, but y=7 or 8 at k=0? Not possible, since start at y=0.\n\nk=2 to 7, and k=10 onwards.\n\nk=2,3,4,5,6,7 safe for y=7 and y=8.\n\nk=10,11,... safe.\n\nNow, to minimize H, we should go up as fast as possible until y=6, then wait if needed to cross y=7 and y=8 at safe times.\n\nSince y=6 is safe, we can stay there.\n\nMinimum time to reach y=6: from y=0, 6 up moves, so at k=6, y=6.\n\nThen from there, we need to go to y=7, then to y=8, then to y=9.\n\nEach step takes one turn.\n\nNow, at y=6, k=6.\n\nWe can go to y=7 at k=7 by action U at k=6.\n\nThen at k=7, y=7.\n\nNow k=7 is safe for y=7.\n\nThen from y=7 at k=7, we can go to y=8 at k=8 by action U at k=7.\n\nBut at k=8, y=8, which is dangerous.\n\nNot good.\n\nAction S at k=7: stay at y=7, then at k=8, y=7, but k=8 dangerous for y=7.\n\nNot good.\n\nAction D at k=7: go to y=6 at k=8, safe, but not progress.\n\nSo from k=7, y=7, we cannot stay or go up to y=8 at k=8 because both dangerous at k=8.\n\nWe need to go to y=7 at a different time.\n\nk=7 is safe, but k=8 is dangerous for y=8.\n\nAfter being at y=7 at k=7, we can delay going up.\n\nFor example, at k=7, y=7, we can go down to y=6 at k=8.\n\nThen at k=8, y=6, safe.\n\nThen later go up again.\n\nBut that takes extra turns.\n\nSince k=10 is safe, we can go to y=7 at k=10.\n\nBut how?\n\nFirst, go to y=6 quickly.\n\nStart: k=0, y=0, action U → y_1=1 at k=1\n\nk=1, y=1, action U → y_2=2 at k=2\n\nk=2, y=2, U → y_3=3 at k=3\n\nk=3, y=3, U → y_4=4 at k=4\n\nk=4, y=4, U → y_5=5 at k=5\n\nk=5, y=5, U → y_6=6 at k=6\n\nNow at k=6, y=6, safe.\n\nWe want to go to y=7 at a safe time.\n\nSafe times for y=7: k not in {1,8,9}, so k=2,3,4,5,6,7,10,11,...\n\nk=7 is available.\n\nBut if we go to y=7 at k=7, then we are stuck because we cannot go to y=8 at k=8.\n\nWe need to go to y=7 when we can proceed to y=8 soon at a safe time.\n\nFor example, go to y=7 at k=7, then instead of going up, we can wait at y=6 until later.\n\nAt k=6, y=6, we can choose not to go up immediately.\n\nFor example, action S at k=6: stay at y=6, then y_7=6 at k=7\n\nThen at k=7, y=6, safe.\n\nThen action U at k=7 → y_8=7 at k=8\n\nBut at k=8, y=7, freeway 7, dangerous at k=8? Yes, k=8 is dangerous for y=7.\n\nNot good.\n\nAction S at k=7: y_8=6 at k=8, still at y=6.\n\nThen we need to go up later.\n\nTo go to y=7 at a time when k+1 is safe for y=8.\n\nSince we go from y to y+1 in one turn.\n\nWhen we are at y at k, after action U, at k+1 we are at y+1.\n\nSo to be at y+1 at k+1, we must not have collision at k+1 on freeway y+1.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y at k, must be safe if on freeway.\n\nFor y=7, we need to be at y=7 at some k safe, then from there, go to y=8 at k+1, which must be safe for y=8.\n\nSo k+1 not dangerous for y=8.\n\nSimilarly, when we go to y=8 at k+1, then we can go to y=9 at k+2, which is always safe since y=9 not freeway.\n\ny=9 no issue.\n\nSo the critical part is to have a safe k for y=7, and k+1 safe for y=8.\n\ny=7 and y=8 both have dangerous times at {1,8,9}\n\nSo we need k not in {1,8,9} and k+1 not in {1,8,9}\n\nk not in {1,8,9} and k+1 not in {1,8,9}\n\n{1,8,9} for k.\n\nIf k=1, then k+1=2, but k=1 not safe for y=7? k=1 is dangerous for y=7, so k cannot be 1.\n\nSimilarly, k=8: k=8 dangerous for y=7, not safe.\n\nk=9: dangerous for y=7.\n\nNow, k+1 not in {1,8,9}, so k not in {0,7,8}\n\nk+1=1 implies k=0\n\nk+1=8 implies k=7\n\nk+1=9 implies k=8\n\nSo k not in {0,7,8} for k+1 not in {1,8,9}\n\nBut also k not in {1,8,9} for itself.\n\nSo overall, for k, to have y=7 at k safe and y=8 at k+1 safe, we need:\n\nk not in {1,8,9} and k not in {0,7,8}? Let's list forbidden k.\n\nFirst, k must be safe for y=7: k ∉ {1,8,9}\n\nSecond, k+1 must be safe for y=8: k+1 ∉ {1,8,9}, so k ∉ {0,7,8}\n\nTherefore, k must not be in {1,8,9} and not in {0,7,8}, so not in {0,1,7,8,9}\n\nThen k can be 2,3,4,5,6,10,11,...\n\nFor example k=2: y=7 at k=2 safe, then y=8 at k=3, which should be safe for y=8 if k=3 not dangerous.\n\ny=8 dangerous at k=1,8,9, so k=3 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly k=3: y=7 at k=3 safe, y=8 at k=4 safe.\n\nk=4: y=7 at k=4 safe, y=8 at k=5 safe.\n\nk=5: y=7 at k=5 safe, y=8 at k=6 safe.\n\nk=6: y=7 at k=6 safe, y=8 at k=7 safe.\n\nk=7: but k=7 is not in {1,8,9}, so safe for y=7? But k+1=8, which is dangerous for y=8.\n\nBut for k=7, y=7 at k=7 is safe, since k=7 not dangerous.\n\nBut then going to y=8 at k=8 is dangerous.\n\nIn the condition above, for k=7, it is not allowed because k+1=8 not safe.\n\nSimilarly, k=10: y=7 at k=10 safe, y=8 at k=11 safe, since k=11 not dangerous.\n\nNow, back to our path.\n\nWe are at y=6 at k=6.\n\nWe can go to y=7 at k=7 by action U at k=6.\n\nThen at k=7, y=7, safe.\n\nBut we cannot go up to y=8 at k=8 because dangerous.\n\nInstead, from y=7 at k=7, we can go down or stay, but both lead to problems at k=8.\n\nAction D at k=7: to y=6 at k=8.\n\nThen at k=8, y=6, safe.\n\nBut we lost progress.\n\nThen at k=8, y=6, we can go to y=7 at k=9 by action U at k=8.\n\nBut at k=9, y=7, freeway 7, dangerous at k=9? Yes, k=9 dangerous, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nAction S at k=8: y=6 at k=9, then go up later.\n\nBut k=9 is dangerous for y=7 and y=8, but we are at y=6, safe.\n\nSo we can stay at y=6 for a while.\n\nTo avoid the dangerous times.\n\nSince we can be at y=7 at k=10, for example.\n\nBut to reach y=6 at k=6, we can stay there until it's safe to cross.\n\nFrom k=6, y=6, if we stay, action S at k=6, then y_7=6 at k=7\n\nThen at k=7, y=6, we can action S again, y_8=6 at k=8\n\nThen at k=8, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at k=8, we can action U to y_9=7 at k=9\n\nBut at k=9, y=7, dangerous, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nAction U at k=8 to y_9=7 at k=9, same.\n\nOr, at k=8, y=6, we can stay, action S, y_9=6 at k=9\n\nThen at k=9, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at k=9, we can go to y=7 at k=10 by action U.\n\nAt k=10, y=7, which is safe since k=10 not dangerous.\n\nThen from there, action U at k=10 to y_11=8 at k=11\n\nAt k=11, y=8, freeway 8, dangerous at k=1,8,9, k=11 not in, safe.\n\nThen action U at k=11 to y_12=9 at k=12.\n\nSo we reach y=9 at k=12.\n\nBut earlier we could have reached in 8 turns but for the danger.\n\nH=12 turns.\n\nBut we might do better.\n\nInstead of staying at y=6, we can go to y=7 earlier at a safe k where we can go to y=8 next.\n\nFor example, go to y=7 at k=6.\n\nCan we be at y=7 at k=6?\n\nk=6, from start.\n\nTo be at y=7 at k=6, we need to have moved up 6 times in 6 turns? From y=0 at k=0, after 6 actions, y_6=6 if we go up each time, not 7.\n\ny_k at turn k.\n\nAt k=0, y=0\n\nAfter 1 up, k=1, y=1\n\nAfter 2, y=2\n\n...\n\nAfter 6 ups, at k=6, y=6\n\nCannot be at y=7 at k=6, because to go from 0 to 7, it takes 7 moves, so y_7=7 at k=7.\n\nSimilarly, minimum to y=7 is k=7.\n\nSimilarly, to y=8 min k=8.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=7 before k=7.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 min k=8.\n\nNow at k=7, we can be at y=7, which is safe.\n\nBut then we cannot go to y=8 at k=8 because dangerous.\n\nThe next possible safe time to be at y=7 is k=10, as above.\n\nk=2,3,4,5,6 are also safe for y=7, but we cannot reach y=7 that early.\n\nFor example, at k=2, to be at y=7, impossible, since max y at k=2 is 2.\n\nSimilarly, k=3 y=3, etc.\n\nSo earliest k for y=7 is k=7.\n\nThen next is k=10, since k=8 and k=9 dangerous.\n\nk=7 is safe, but we cannot proceed to y=8 at k=8.\n\nSo we must skip to k=10 for y=7.\n\nSimilarly, from y=6 at k=6, we can stay until k=9, then at k=9 go to y=7 at k=10? Let's see the actions.\n\nAt k=6, y=6\n\nWe need to have y=7 at k=10.\n\nFrom k=6 to k=10, we have 4 turns: k=6,7,8,9 actions to set position at k=10.\n\nAt k=10, we want y_10=7.\n\ny_10 depends on previous.\n\ny_6=6 at k=6\n\nThen actions at k=6,7,8,9 determine y_7,y_8,y_9,y_10.\n\nWe want y_10=7.\n\nAlso, during, at each turn, must be safe if on freeway.\n\nSince y=6 is safe, we can stay at y=6 for multiple turns.\n\nFor example, from k=6 to k=9, stay at y=6 by doing S each time.\n\nThen at k=9, y=6 (since action at k=9 determines y_10, but position at turn k.\n\nAt turn k, position y_k.\n\nAfter action at k, y_{k+1}.\n\nAt k=6, y_6=6\n\nAction a_6: if S, then y_7=6\n\nAt k=7, y_7=6\n\nAction a_7: S, y_8=6\n\nk=8, y_8=6\n\nAction a_8: S, y_9=6\n\nk=9, y_9=6\n\nThen action a_9: U, then y_10=7\n\nAt k=10, y_10=7, which is safe.\n\nThen action a_10: U, to y_11=8\n\nAt k=11, y_11=8, safe (k=11 not dangerous)\n\nThen action a_11: U, to y_12=9\n\nAt k=12, y_12=9, done.\n\nH=12, from k=0 to k=12, 12 turns, actions from k=0 to k=11.\n\nBut k=0 to k=11 inclusive? Let's count.\n\nStart at k=0, after H actions, at turn k=H.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at k=0.\n\nAfter 1 action, at k=1.\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions, at k=H.\n\nWe want y_H =9.\n\nIn this case, after 12 actions, at k=12, y=9.\n\nActions from k=0 to k=11.\n\nNow, is there a shorter way?\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=7 at k=7, but then instead of staying, go down to avoid the danger.\n\nFor example, at k=7, y=7, safe.\n\nThen action D at k=7, to y_8=6 at k=8.\n\nAt k=8, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at k=8, action U to y_9=7 at k=9.\n\nBut at k=9, y=7, dangerous, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nAction S at k=8 to y_9=6, then at k=9, action U to y_10=7 at k=10, safe.\n\nThen proceed as before.\n\nBut we still reach y=9 at k=12? Let's see.\n\nk=7: y=7, action D → y_8=6 at k=8\n\nk=8: y=6, action S → y_9=6 at k=9? Action at k=8: S, so y_9=6\n\nThen k=9: y=6, action U → y_10=7 at k=10\n\nThen same as before.\n\nNo savings.\n\nFrom k=7 y=7, action S at k=7 → y_8=7 at k=8, but k=8 dangerous, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo we must be at y=7 not at k=8 or k=9.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nThe minimal H might be 12.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can be at y=7 earlier or later with less delay.\n\nEarliest at k=7.\n\nBut we have to wait until k=10 to be safe to go up.\n\nk=10 is the first safe after k=7 for y=7 that allows going to y=8.\n\nk=7 is safe for y=7 but not for transition to y=8.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=8 at a safe time directly, but to be on y=8, we must come from y=7 or y=9, but y=9 not yet.\n\nSo must go through y=7.\n\nAnother idea: since freeway 1 is dangerous later, but we are not there at that time, so no issue.\n\nIn this case, only y=7 and y=8 have early dangers at k=8,9.\n\nk=1 is also dangerous, but we are not at y=7 or 8 at k=1.\n\nNow, to save time, perhaps we can go up to y=5 or something and wait, but y=5 is always safe, but going down might not help.\n\nFor example, go to y=5 at k=5.\n\nThen stay until later.\n\nBut to go to y=7, we still need to pass y=6 and y=7.\n\ny=6 is safe always, so better to be at y=6 to wait.\n\nWe can reach y=6 at k=6.\n\nThen from k=6 to k=9, we stay at y=6 for 3 turns: k=6,7,8 actions S, so at k=7,8,9 y=6.\n\nThen at k=9, action U to y_10=7 at k=10.\n\nAs before.\n\nBut at k=9, we are at y=6, action U, so at k=10, y=7.\n\nWe can do action U at k=9 to go to y=7 at k=10.\n\nBut k=9 we are at y=6.\n\nNow, the dangerous time k=9 for y=7, but we are not on y=7 at k=9, we are on y=6 at k=9.\n\nThen at k=10, we go to y=7.\n\nSimilarly, no problem.\n\nSo H=12 seems necessary? But let's see if we can do with less.\n\nSuppose we go to y=7 at k=7, then at k=7 action D to y_8=6 at k=8.\n\nThen at k=8, action U to y_9=7 at k=9, but k=9 dangerous for y=7.\n\nCollision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nAt k=8, from y=6, if we go to y=7 at k=9, dangerous.\n\nSo we must avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at k=8 or k=9.\n\nThus, the only way is to be on y=7 at k=10 or later.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nBut since we go from y=7 to y=8 at k+1, we can do y=7 at k=10, y=8 at k=11, y=9 at k=12.\n\nNow, what about the lower part? We can reach y=6 at k=6.\n\nThen we need to stay at y=6 from k=6 to k=9, that is, at turns k=6,7,8, we do S, so y_7=6, y_8=6, y_9=6.\n\nThen at k=9, do U, y_10=7.\n\nThen at k=10, do U, y_11=8.\n\nAt k=11, do U, y_12=9.\n\nSo actions: from k=0 to k=5: U each to go from y=0 to y=6 in 6 turns.\n\nThen k=6,7,8: S to stay at y=6.\n\nThen k=9: U to y=7\n\nk=10: U to y=8\n\nk=11: U to y=9\n\nSo at k=12, y=9.\n\nH=12 turns.\n\nBut we start from k=0, after 12 actions, at k=12.\n\nNumber of actions: 12.\n\nIs there a way with H=11?\n\nFor example, if we can reach y=6 earlier or something.\n\nMinimum to y=6 is 6 turns, k=6.\n\nThen to y=7 at k=10, we need 4 turns in between, but we can only stay or move, but to delay, we need to spend turns at y=6.\n\nFrom k=6 to k=9, 3 turns to stay, then to y=7 at k=10.\n\nIf we want to reach earlier, but we cannot be at y=7 before k=10 safely for the transition.\n\nPerhaps at k=7, y=7, but we cannot stay there or go up without danger at k=8.\n\nUnless we go down to y=6 at k=8, but then we have to come back, taking extra turn.\n\nFor example: k=7, y=7, action D → y_8=6 at k=8\n\nThen k=8, y=6, action U → y_9=7 at k=9, but k=9 dangerous, collision.\n\nk=8, y=6, action S → y_9=6, then k=9, action U → y_10=7, same as before.\n\nNo savings.\n\nSo minimal H is 12.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 1, but we are not on it at k=16-19, so no issue.\n\nNow, about the answer format.\n\nWe need to output the actions starting from turn t1=54.\n\nRelative k, absolute turn.\n\nAt turn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nIn the sequence, actions for turns: turn 54: a_{54}, turn 55: a_{55}, ..., up to turn 54 + H -1, and position at turn 54 + H should be (0,9).\n\nIn terms of k: actions at k=0 to k=H-1, position at k=H is y=9.\n\nIn this case, H=12 actions.\n\nActions:\n\nk=0 (turn 54): U\n\nk=1 (turn 55): U\n\nk=2 (turn 56): U\n\nk=3 (turn 57): U\n\nk=4 (turn 58): U\n\nk=5 (turn 59): U  // now at y=6 at k=6 (turn 60)\n\nk=6 (turn 60): S  // stay, so at k=7 (turn 61), y=6\n\nk=7 (turn 61): S  // at k=8 (turn 62), y=6\n\nk=8 (turn 62): S  // at k=9 (turn 63), y=6\n\nk=9 (turn 63): U  // to y=7 at k=10 (turn 64)\n\nk=10 (turn 64): U  // to y=8 at k=11 (turn 65)\n\nk=11 (turn 65): U  // to y=9 at k=12 (turn 66)\n\nAt k=12, turn 66, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, we need to make sure no collision.\n\nCheck each turn where y between 1 and 8.\n\nk=1: turn 55, y=1, freeway 1, time relative k=1, not dangerous (dangerous at 16-19), safe.\n\nk=2: y=2, freeway 2, always safe\n\nk=3: y=3, safe\n\nk=4: y=4, safe\n\nk=5: y=5, safe\n\nk=6: y=6, freeway 6, always safe\n\nk=7: y=6, freeway 6, safe\n\nk=8: y=6, freeway 6, safe\n\nk=9: y=6, freeway 6, safe\n\nk=10: y=7, freeway 7, time k=10, not dangerous (dangerous at 1,8,9), safe\n\nk=11: y=8, freeway 8, time k=11, not dangerous, safe\n\nk=12: y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nH=12.\n\nBut is there a way with H=11?\n\nSuppose we go up faster or slower.\n\nFor example, if we start by staying at y=0 for some turns, but that would delay, worse.\n\nOr go down, not useful.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=7 at k=10 with fewer total turns, but we need to reach y=6 first, which takes min 6 turns, then wait 3 turns, then up to y=7,8,9 in 3 turns, total 12.\n\nIf we go to y=6 slower, it takes more turns.\n\nSo minimal is 12.\n\nBut let's see freeway 7 and 8 dangerous at k=1,8,9.\n\nk=10 is safe.\n\nAnother point: at k=7, we can be at y=7, and since k=7 safe, but we cannot stay, so we must leave.\n\nIf we go down to y=6 at k=8, then at k=8, y=6 safe, but then we go to y=7 at k=9 or k=10.\n\nIf k=9, dangerous.\n\nSo must go at k=10.\n\nThus, no shorter.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=8 directly from y=7 at a safe time.\n\nBut no.\n\nI think 12 is minimal.\n\nNow, about the car on freeway 6, we have two cars, but we saw it is always safe except t=0, irrelevant.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nIn the initial state, freeway 6 has (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12), but we saw that only at t=0, x=0 covered, but not for player, so safe.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 7 and 8, at k=1, if player were there, but not.\n\nIn our path, no issue.\n\nSo the sequence should be:\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: U\n\nTurn 57: U\n\nTurn 58: U\n\nTurn 59: U\n\nTurn 60: S\n\nTurn 61: S\n\nTurn 62: S\n\nTurn 63: U\n\nTurn 64: U\n\nTurn 65: U\n\nThen at turn 66, position (0,9)\n\nBut the actions are from turn 54 to 65, that's 12 actions.\n\nIn the answer, it should be listed as:\n\nTurn 54: a_{54} = U\n\nTurn 55: a_{55} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 65: a_{65} = U\n\nIn the format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nt_1 is 54.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 54: U\n\nTurn 55: U\n\nTurn 56: U\n\nTurn 57: U\n\nTurn 58: U\n\nTurn 59: U\n\nTurn 60: S\n\nTurn 61: S\n\nTurn 62: S\n\nTurn 63: U\n\nTurn 64: U\n\nTurn 65: U\n\nH=12 turns of actions.\n\nBut the player reaches at turn 66, but the last action is at turn 65, leading to position at turn 66.\n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" to reach position at t_1 + H.\n\nIn this case, H=12.\n\nPerhaps we can reach in 11 actions?\n\nSuppose we go up to y=5 at k=5, then stay, but to go to y=7, we need to go through y=6 and y=7.\n\nIf we go to y=5 at k=5, then we can stay at y=5 until later, but y=5 is safe, but to reach y=7, it will take more turns if we stay longer.\n\nFor example, at k=5, y=5.\n\nThen we can go to y=6 at k=6, etc., same as before.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nGo to y=6 at k=6, then at k=6, instead of staying, go to y=7 at k=7, but then we have to deal with the danger.\n\nI think it's not possible with less than 12.\n\nSo I think H=12 is minimal.\n\nNow, write the answer.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn 54 in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8, the player must navigate around dangerous times on freeways y=7 and y=8. The dangerous times for these freeways, relative to turn 54, are at turns where the relative turn index k (k = T - 54) is 1, 8, or 9. Specifically:\n- Freeway y=7 is dangerous at k=1, 8, 9 (absolute turns 55, 62, 63).\n- Freeway y=8 is dangerous at k=1, 8, 9 (absolute turns 55, 62, 63).\n\nThe player starts at y=0 at turn 54 (k=0). To minimize the number of turns, the player should ascend to y=6 as quickly as possible, as freeways y=1 to y=6 are safe at all times except for specific cases that do not affect this path. Reaching y=6 takes 6 turns (by moving up each turn). However, the player must avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at the dangerous times k=8 and k=9 (absolute turns 62 and 63). Therefore, after reaching y=6 at turn 60 (k=6), the player stays at y=6 for three turns (turns 60, 61, and 62) by choosing the \"S\" (stay) action. Then, at turn 63 (k=9), the player moves up to y=7, which is safe since k=9 is not dangerous for y=7 at that time (k=9 is dangerous only if the player is on y=7 at turn 63, but the move to y=7 occurs at turn 64). The player then moves up to y=8 at turn 64 (k=10) and to y=9 at turn 65 (k=11), both safe.\n\nThe sequence of actions, with 12 turns (H=12), is as follows:\n\n- Turn 54: U (move to y=1 at turn 55)\n- Turn 55: U (move to y=2 at turn 56)\n- Turn 56: U (move to y=3 at turn 57)\n- Turn 57: U (move to y=4 at turn 58)\n- Turn 58: U (move to y=5 at turn 59)\n- Turn 59: U (move to y=6 at turn 60)\n- Turn 60: S (stay at y=6 at turn 61)\n- Turn 61: S (stay at y=6 at turn 62)\n- Turn 62: S (stay at y=6 at turn 63)\n- Turn 63: U (move to y=7 at turn 64)\n- Turn 64: U (move to y=8 at turn 65)\n- Turn 65: U (move to y=9 at turn 66)\n\nAt turn 66, the player reaches (0, 9). This path avoids all collisions:\n- At turns 55-59 (y=1 to y=5), the freeways are safe as per the car positions and dangerous times.\n- At turns 60-62 (y=6), freeway y=6 is always safe.\n- At turn 64 (y=7), k=10 is not dangerous (dangerous at k=1,8,9).\n- At turn 65 (y=8), k=11 is not dangerous (dangerous at k=1,8,9).\n\nNo shorter path is possible because the dangerous times at k=8 and k=9 (turns 62 and 63) must be avoided, requiring a delay at y=6 until it is safe to ascend through y=7 and y=8.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 54: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 55: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 56: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 57: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 58: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 59: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 60: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 61: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 62: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 63: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 64: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 65: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,2) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically, and cars move horizontally on their freeways. Collision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and at that turn, for a car on that freeway, the x=0 is within the car's span.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at each turn relative to the player's position.\n\nThe current turn is t1 = 56. Player is at y=2.\n\nI need to move up to y=9, so I have to go through y=3 to y=8, but I might not need to stay on each one; I just need to avoid being on a freeway when a car covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nThe key point is that when I decide to move to a new y, I am not on that new y until the next turn. So, for example, if at turn T I am at y_T, and I choose to move up to y_{T+1} = y_T + 1, then at turn T, I am still on y_T, so I only care about cars on y_T at turn T. When I arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1, I care about cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nSimilarly for down or stay.\n\nNow, cars are moving with constant speed. Let me denote the time from current turn t1=56.\n\nFor a car on freeway k, with initial head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s at turn t1.\n\nThen at turn T = t1 + Δt, where Δt is the number of turns from now.\n\nThe span changes based on direction.\n\nFor left-moving cars (d = left), I assume? The problem says left-moving and right-moving.\n\nIn the car state, it says \"direction d\", but in the table, it says \"right\" for all, so probably d is given as left or right.\n\nIn the table, all are \"right\", so all cars are moving to the right.\n\nFor right-moving: initial span [τ, h]? Let's see the update rule.\n\nIt says: for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, for example, freeway 1: (-42, -53, right, 3)\n\nBut -42 and -53, which is head and tail? It says (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nSo for freeway 1: h = -42, τ = -53, d = right, s = 3.\n\nSince d=right, it's right-moving, so Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-53, -42], I think? But τ is tail, h is head, so for right-moving, the tail is at the left, head at right, so span from τ to h, with τ < h since moving right.\n\nIn this case, τ = -53, h = -42, so τ = -53 < h = -42, so span is from left to right: [τ, h] = [-53, -42].\n\nThen at time T, Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] = [-53 + 3*(T-56), -42 + 3*(T-56)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y at turn T, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in Span(T).\n\nThat is, min(span) <= 0 <= max(span).\n\nSince span is [left, right], for right-moving car, left = τ + s*(T-t1), right = h + s*(T-t1), so 0 is in [left, right] if left <= 0 <= right.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all are right-moving here.\n\nIn this problem, all cars are right-moving, so we don't have left-moving.\n\nNow, freeways are y=1 to 8, each can have multiple cars.\n\nPlayer starts at y=2, which is freeway 2? Freeway k, I think k is the y-level.\n\ny=1 to 8 are freeways, so freeway 1 is y=1, freeway 2 is y=2, etc.\n\nPlayer is at (0,2), so on freeway 2 at turn t1=56.\n\nBut at turn t1, we need to check if there is a collision at the start? Or only when we are moving.\n\nThe collision condition is at turn T, if player is on freeway y, and car on y has 0 in span at T.\n\nAt turn t1, player is on y=2, so we need to check for cars on freeway 2 at turn t1.\n\nFreeway 2 has cars: (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nSo for this car at t1=56, span is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? τ = -59, h = -48, so left = -59, right = -48, so [ -59, -48 ]\n\n0 is not in [-59, -48], since -48 < 0? -48 is less than 0, so min=-59, max=-48, both negative, 0 not in between, so no collision at t1 on y=2.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, but at t1, player is only on y=2, so we only care about y=2 at t1, which is safe.\n\nNow, we need to move to y=9. y=9 is not a freeway, I think freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,2), which is on freeway 2, and we need to reach (0,9), which is above freeway 8, so y=9 is safe.\n\nThe grid is vertical axis y=0 to 9, and freeways y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no cars, so safe.\n\nPlayer can move up or down or stay.\n\nTo minimize turns, we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nSince we start at y=2, need to go to y=9, that's 7 steps up, so minimum H=7 if we can go up every turn without collision.\n\nBut we might have to wait or go down sometimes to avoid cars.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: only one car: (h, τ, d, s) = (-42, -53, right, 3)\n\nFreeway 2: one car: (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 3: one car: (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 4: one car: (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 5: one car: (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 6: two cars: (-48, -59, right, 12) and (24, 13, right, 12)  head and tail? (24,13), so h=24, τ=13? But for right-moving, if h=24, τ=13, that would be from 13 to 24, but 13<24, so moving right.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: two cars: (-36, -47, right, 6) and (12, 1, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: (-36, -47, right, 6) and (12, 1, right, 6)\n\nIn freeway 6, first car: (-48, -59, right, 12), second car: (24,13, right,12)\n\nBut (24,13), if h=24, τ=13, then τ=13, h=24, so span [13,24] at t1.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 7: first car: (-36,-47,right,6) so τ=-47, h=-36? Head and tail: h=head, τ=tail, so for right-moving, tail is left, head is right, so if h=-36, τ=-47, then τ=-47 < h=-36, so span [ -47, -36 ]\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,6), h=12, τ=1, so τ=1 < h=12, span [1,12]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8 same as freeway 7.\n\nNow, since all cars are moving right, we can find for each freeway and each time, whether x=0 is occupied.\n\nBut time is discrete, turns.\n\nLet Δt = T - t1, so at time from now, Δt.\n\nFor a car on freeway k, at time Δt from now, the span is:\n\nFor right-moving: left = τ + s * Δt, right = h + s * Δt\n\nThen 0 is in [left, right] if left <= 0 <= right, i.e., -right <= 0 <= -left? No.\n\nleft <= 0 and 0 <= right? Since left <= right for right-moving.\n\nSo collision if left <= 0 <= right.\n\nWhich is equivalent to -right <= 0 <= -left? Better to compute numerically.\n\nWe need to find for each freeway y, and for each Δt, if there is a car such that left <= 0 <= right.\n\nThen, for the player, when on freeway y at time Δt, there is collision if that condition holds for some car on y.\n\nIf no car or no car covering 0, safe.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway the cars and their positions over time.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car with s=3, τ=-53, h=-42\n\nAt Δt, left = -53 + 3Δt, right = -42 + 3Δt\n\n0 in [left, right] if -53 + 3Δt <= 0 <= -42 + 3Δt\n\nWhich is 3Δt <= 53 and 42 <= 3Δt? Let's solve inequalities.\n\n-53 + 3Δt <= 0 => 3Δt <= 53 => Δt <= 53/3 ≈ 17.666, so Δt <= 17 since integer?

Head and tail: (24,13), so h=24, τ=13, d=right, s=12.\n\nSo left = τ + s Δt =13 +12Δt, right = h + s Δt =24 +12Δt\n\nSince moving right, left=13+12Δt, right=24+12Δt\n\n0 in [left, right] if 13+12Δt <=0 <=24+12Δt\n\nBut left=13+12Δt >=13>0 for all Δt>=0, so left >0, thus 0 < left <= right, so 0 not in [left, right] since left>0.\n\nThus this car never covers x=0, always to the right.\n\nSo for freeway 6, only the first car matters, collision at Δt=4.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-36,-47,right,6) so τ=-47, h=-36, s=6\n\nleft = -47 +6Δt, right = -36 +6Δt\n\n0 in if -47+6Δt <=0 <= -36+6Δt\n\nSo -47+6Δt <=0 => 6Δt <=47 => Δt <=47/6≈7.833, Δt <=7\n\n0 <= -36+6Δt => 36 <=6Δt => Δt >=6\n\nSo Δt >=6 and Δt <=7\n\nAt Δt=6: left= -47+36= -11, right= -36+36=0, [-11,0], 0 in\n\nΔt=7: left= -47+42= -5, right= -36+42=6, [-5,6], 0 in\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,6) τ=1, h=12, s=6\n\nleft=1+6Δt, right=12+6Δt\n\nleft=1+6Δt >=1>0, so never <=0, so 0 not in, always safe for this car.\n\nSo for freeway 7, collision at Δt=6 and 7 due to first car.\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7, collision at Δt=6 and 7.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, unsafe times (Δt when collision if player on that freeway):\n\ny=1: unsafe at Δt=14,15,16,17\n\ny=2: unsafe at Δt=4\n\ny=3: unsafe at Δt=4\n\ny=4: unsafe at Δt=4\n\ny=5: unsafe at Δt=4\n\ny=6: unsafe at Δt=4  (only at Δt=4, from first car)\n\ny=7: unsafe at Δt=6,7\n\ny=8: unsafe at Δt=6,7\n\nNow, player starts at y=2 at Δt=0.\n\nAt Δt=0, player on y=2, which is unsafe only at Δt=4, not at 0, so safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9. y=9 has no freeway, so when player is at y=9, no collision possible.\n\nThe position is (0,9), which is above the grid, but since no freeway at y=9, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 is safe.\n\nPlayer can move up, down, or stay.\n\nEach action changes y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\ny must stay within 0 to 9.\n\nStart at y=2, need to go to y=9.\n\nMinimum moves: 7 up moves, but may need to wait or detour to avoid unsafe times.\n\nSince unsafe times are only at specific Δt, we might be able to go straight up if we time it right.\n\nBut let's see the unsafe times: for y=2,3,4,5,6 all unsafe only at Δt=4.\n\ny=7 and 8 unsafe at Δt=6 and 7.\n\ny=1 unsafe at 14-17, but we might not go to y=1 since we start at 2 and go up.\n\nBut we could go down to y=1 if needed, but probably not necessary since we want to go up.\n\nFirst, let's list the path.\n\nLet y_t be the y-position at time t, with t relative to t1, so at time Δt, y_{Δt} is position after Δt turns.\n\nDefine the sequence.\n\nAt turn t1 + t for t=0,1,2,... but in the action, actions are for turns.\n\nSet t = 0 at current turn, so at turn 0 (t1), position y=2.\n\nAfter action a_0, we move to y at turn 1, and so on.\n\nDefine time steps.\n\nLet k be the step from now, k=0,1,2,...\n\nAt step k (meaning after k actions, at turn t1 + k), the player position is y_k.\n\ny_k depends on previous actions.\n\nStart: at k=0, y_0 = 2.\n\nAfter action a_k at turn t1 + k, we have y_{k+1} = y_k + Δy, with Δy based on a_k.\n\nThe collision is checked at each turn when the player is on a freeway.\n\nAt turn t1 + k, position y_k, if y_k between 1 and 8, we need to check if at that time, freeway y_k is unsafe.\n\nThe time Δt for car position is exactly k, since Δt = (t1 + k) - t1 = k.\n\nSo at step k, Δt = k.\n\nSo for position y_k at time k, if y_k in {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, then collision if freeway y_k is unsafe at time k.\n\nUnsafe as above.\n\nWe need y_H = 9 for some H, with H minimal.\n\ny_H is the position after H actions, at turn t1 + H.\n\nThe turn when we reach (0,9) is at turn t1 + H, with y_H = 9.\n\nAt that turn, since y_H=9 not a freeway, no collision.\n\nThe actions are from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1}, since after H actions we are at turn t1 + H.\n\nIn the sequence, actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, so t from 0 to H-1.\n\nAfter t=0 action, at turn t1+1, position y1, and so on, up to after action a_{t1 + H-1}, at turn t1 + H, position y_H.\n\nWe want y_H = 9.\n\nAnd at each turn t1 + k for k=0 to H-1, position y_k, must be safe if on freeway.\n\nk from 0 to H-1: at turn t1 + k, position y_k.\n\nFor k from 0 to H-1, y_k is the position during the turn, before action or after?\n\nClarify the timing.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t1 + k, player is at position (0, y_k).\n\nThen we choose action a_k, which determines y_{k+1} for the next turn.\n\nDuring turn t1 + k, player is at y_k, and we check collision based on cars at that turn.\n\nThen after action, player moves to y_{k+1} for turn t1 + k+1.\n\nIn the collision rule: \"collision occurs at turn T only if ... for any car on freeway y_T\"\n\ny_T is the position at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, player is at y_T, and we check cars on freeway y_T at time T.\n\nFor turn t1 + k, position y_k, so we check if y_k in 1-8 and unsafe at time k (Δt=k).\n\nThen we perform action a_k to go to y_{k+1}.\n\nWe start at k=0, y_0=2.\n\nWe need to reach y_H = 9 at turn t1 + H.\n\nH is the number of actions, and we reach after H actions.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nNow, the unsafe times:\n\nLet me list for each k, which y are unsafe.\n\nFrom above:\n\nAt k=0: unsafe y: none? y=2 unsafe at k=4, but k=0 not 4.\n\nFor each k, the unsafe freeways:\n\nk=0: Δt=0\n\ny=1: unsafe at 14-17, not 0\n\ny=2: unsafe at 4, not 0\n\nSimilarly, all safe at k=0.\n\nk=1: Δt=1\n\ny=1: unsafe only 14-17, not 1\n\ny=2: unsafe at 4, not 1\n\nAll y safe at k=1? Let's see.\n\ny=1: collision only at k=14,15,16,17, so at k=1 safe.\n\ny=2: only k=4 unsafe, so safe at k=1.\n\nSimilarly y=3,4,5,6: only unsafe at k=4, so at k=1 safe.\n\ny=7: unsafe at k=6,7, not 1, safe.\n\ny=8: same, safe.\n\nSo at k=1, all freeways safe.\n\nk=2: similarly, all safe except possibly, but unsafe only at specific points, so safe.\n\nk=3: safe.\n\nk=4: unsafe for y=2,3,4,5,6\n\nSpecifically, y=2,3,4,5,6 are unsafe at k=4.\n\ny=1,7,8 safe at k=4.\n\nk=5: all safe? y=1 unsafe only 14-17, y=2 etc only at k=4, y=7 at k=6,7.\n\nAt k=5, no unsafe, all safe.\n\nk=6: unsafe for y=7 and y=8\n\ny=7 and y=8 unsafe at k=6.\n\ny=1-6 safe? y=1 unsafe at 14-17, not 6; y=2-6 only at k=4, not 6; so y=1-6 safe at k=6, y=7 and 8 unsafe.\n\nk=7: unsafe for y=7 and y=8\n\nk=8: all safe? y=7,8 unsafe only at 6,7, so at k=8 safe.\n\nSimilarly k=9 to 13: all safe, since no unsafe times except later.\n\nk=14: unsafe for y=1\n\ny=1 unsafe at k=14,15,16,17.\n\nOthers safe.\n\netc.\n\nNow, back to player.\n\nStart at k=0, y=2, safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nTo minimize H, we should go up as much as possible.\n\nBut we must avoid being on unsafe freeways at unsafe times.\n\nSpecifically, at k=4, y=2,3,4,5,6 are all unsafe, so we cannot be on any of them at k=4.\n\nSimilarly, at k=6 and k=7, y=7 and y=8 are unsafe, so we cannot be on y=7 or y=8 at k=6 or k=7.\n\nNow, since we start at y=2 at k=0.\n\nIf we go up every turn, at k=0: y=2\n\na0=U, then at k=1, y=3\n\na1=U, at k=2, y=4\n\na2=U, at k=3, y=5\n\na3=U, at k=4, y=6\n\nBut at k=4, y=6, which is unsafe, since freeway 6 unsafe at k=4. Collision.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=6 at k=4.\n\nSimilarly, if we go slower, but we want minimal time.\n\nWe need to not be on y=2 to 6 at k=4.\n\nSimilarly, not on y=7 or 8 at k=6 or k=7.\n\nNow, possible ways:\n\nWe could be above or below at those times.\n\nFor example, at k=4, we could be on y<2 or y>6.\n\ny<2 means y=0 or y=1.\n\ny=0 is safe, y=1 is unsafe only at k=14-17, which is later, so at k=4, y=1 is safe.\n\ny>6 means y=7,8,9.\n\nBut y=9 is safe, no freeway.\n\ny=7 and 8 unsafe at k=6 and 7, but k=4 is before, so at k=4, y=7 or 8 should be safe, since unsafe only at k=6,7.\n\nAt k=4, for y=7: unsafe at k=6,7, not 4, so safe at k=4.\n\nSimilarly y=8 safe at k=4.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nSo at k=4, we can be on y=0,1,7,8,9 to avoid collision.\n\nSimilarly, at k=6 and k=7, we need to not be on y=7 or 8.\n\nSo we can be on y<=6 or y=9.\n\ny=0 to 6 or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 is target.\n\nNow, we start from y=2 at k=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nLet me think the fastest way.\n\nOption: go up directly but avoid k=4 on middle rows.\n\nFor example, by k=4, we can be at y=7 or 8 or 0 or 1.\n\nSince we want to go up, better to be high.\n\nAt k=3, before action at k=3, position y_3.\n\nThen action a3 determines y_4.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nList the positions over time.\n\nk=0: y=2, safe\n\nNow action a0: can be U, D, or S.\n\nIf U, then y1=3\n\nIf D, y1=1\n\nIf S, y1=2\n\nWe want to minimize time, so probably U or S, not D.\n\nBut D might be needed to go below.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSince at k=4 we need to not be on y=2-6, and we start low, we might go down to y=1 or stay low, but that might take more time.\n\nOr go up fast to be above.\n\nFor example, from k=0 to k=3, we have 4 actions: a0 to a3, to reach y at k=4.\n\nAt k=4, y_4 must not be in {2,3,4,5,6}\n\ny_4 can be 0,1,7,8,9.\n\nBut y=9 might be too far.\n\nStart y0=2.\n\nAfter 4 actions, y4 = y0 + sum of Δy for first 4 actions.\n\nEach Δy = -1,0,1.\n\ny4 = 2 + sum_{i=0}^3 Δy_i\n\nWe need y4 <=1 or y4 >=7.\n\ny4 <=1 or y4 >=7.\n\nSince y0=2, to have y4 <=1, we need net down move, at least 1 down (since 2-1=1, or less).\n\ny4 <=1: min y4=2-4= -2, but y cannot be below 0, so y4 >=0.\n\ny4 <=1 means y4=0 or 1.\n\nTo reach y4=0 or 1 from y0=2 in 4 steps, we need at least one down move, and no more than 3 up, but since we want to go up eventually, going down might not be efficient.\n\ny4 >=7: y4=7,8,9.\n\nFrom y0=2, to y4=7, need +5 in 4 steps, impossible since max +4, so y4 <=6 if only up or stay.\n\ny4 max is 2+4=6 if all U.\n\ny4 min is 2-4=-2, but clamped to 0, so if all D, y4=0 after 4 downs, but y cannot be negative.\n\ny from 0 to 9.\n\nIf all U: y1=3, y2=4, y3=5, y4=6\n\nBut y4=6 at k=4 unsafe.\n\nIf we do some downs, e.g., at some point go down.\n\nBut to have y4 <=1.\n\nFor example, one D and three S: y4=1 if a0=D, a1=S, a2=S, a3=S: y1=1, y2=1, y3=1, y4=1\n\nOr other combinations, but y4=1 or 0.\n\nBut y=1 at k=4 is safe, since y=1 unsafe only at k=14-17.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 safe.\n\nBut we are at low position, then need to go up to 9, which takes more time.\n\ny4=7 or above impossible in 4 steps from 2, since max to 6.\n\ny4=8 or 9 even worse.\n\nSo only possibility is y4 <=1, i.e., y4=0 or 1.\n\nThen from there, we need to go up.\n\nBut let's see the time.\n\nAfter k=4, we can go up.\n\nBut at k=6 and k=7, we need to avoid y=7 and 8.\n\nAlso, y=1 is unsafe at k=14-17, but we might not be there at that time.\n\nFirst, let's assume we go to y=1 at k=4.\n\nFor example, one way: at k=0, y=2, we do a0=D, to y1=1\n\nThen at k=1, y=1, safe (since k=1 not unsafe for y=1)\n\nThen we can stay or go up.\n\nBut we need to be at y=1 at k=4? Not necessarily, but for y4 to be 1.\n\nSince we are at y=1 at k=1, we can stay there until k=4.\n\nSo actions: a0=D (to y1=1)\n\nThen at k=1, y=1, safe\n\na1=S, to y2=1\n\nk=2, y=1, safe\n\na2=S, to y3=1\n\nk=3, y=1, safe\n\na3=S, to y4=1\n\nk=4, y=1, which is safe, as above.\n\nThen from here, we need to go to y=9.\n\ny=1 at k=4.\n\nNow, we can start going up.\n\nBut at k=6 and k=7, we need to not be on y=7 or 8.\n\nIf we go up directly: from y4=1\n\na4=U, to y5=2\n\nk=5, y=2, safe (k=5 all safe)\n\na5=U, to y6=3\n\nk=6, y=3? But at k=6, we need to avoid y=7 and 8, but y=3 is fine, safe.\n\nk=6, y=3: y=3 unsafe only at k=4, not at k=6, so safe.\n\nThen a6=U, to y7=4\n\nk=7, y=4, unsafe? k=7, y=4 unsafe? y=4 unsafe only at k=4, not at k=7, so safe.\n\ny=4 is freeway 4, unsafe only at k=4, at k=7 safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\na7=U, to y8=5\n\nk=8, y=5, safe\n\na8=U, to y9=6\n\nk=9, y=6, safe? y=6 unsafe only at k=4, not at k=9, so safe.\n\na9=U, to y10=7\n\nk=10, y=7, now at k=10, is y=7 unsafe? y=7 unsafe at k=6 and 7, not at k=10, so safe.\n\na10=U, to y11=8\n\nk=11, y=8, unsafe? y=8 unsafe at k=6 and 7, not at k=11, safe.\n\na11=U, to y12=9\n\nk=12, y=9, safe, reached.\n\nBut H=12, since we reached at k=12.\n\nBut we have y12=9 at turn t1+12.\n\nNumber of actions: from k=0 to k=11 actions, 12 actions? Let's index.\n\nActions a0 to a11, 12 actions, position from y0 to y12.\n\ny0 at k=0, after a0, y1 at k=1, ..., after a11, y12 at k=12.\n\ny12=9.\n\nBut H should be the number of turns from start to reach, or the number of actions?\n\nIn the problem: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"at turn t1 + H - 1: a_{t1 + H -1}\" and after that action, at turn t1 + H, we are at (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to H-1 for actions, so H actions? Let's see.\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so t from 0 to H-1, that's H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, position y_H =9.\n\nIn my notation, k from 0 to H, y_k at turn t1 + k.\n\ny_H =9 after H actions.\n\nIn my earlier, with 12 actions, H=12.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nIn the above, from k=4 at y=1, we went up slowly, but we can go faster.\n\nSince at k=4 we are at y=1, and we need to go to 9, 8 steps up, but we might skip some or go faster.\n\nBut we have to avoid k=6 and k=7 on y=7 or 8.\n\nIn the above path, we were not on y=7 or 8 at k=6 or 7, since at k=6 y=3, k=7 y=4, both low.\n\nBut we can go up faster from y=1.\n\nFor example, at k=4, y=1\n\na4=U, to y5=2 at k=5\n\na5=U, to y6=3 at k=6\n\nk=6, y=3, safe\n\na6=U, to y7=4 at k=7\n\nk=7, y=4, safe\n\na7=U, to y8=5 at k=8\n\na8=U, to y9=6 at k=9\n\na9=U, to y10=7 at k=10\n\na10=U, to y11=8 at k=11\n\na11=U, to y12=9 at k=12\n\nSame as before, H=12.\n\nBut from y=1 at k=4, we can do multiple ups, but each step only one.\n\nUnless we are already high, but we are low.\n\nAnother idea: instead of going down to y=1 at k=4, we could go up but slower to be at y=7 or 8 at k=4, but earlier we saw impossible from y=2 in 4 steps to y>=7.\n\ny=7 requires +5 in 4 steps, impossible.\n\nSo only option at k=4 is to be low: y=0 or 1.\n\ny=0 is possible.\n\nFor example, to be at y=0 at k=4.\n\nFrom y=2, we need to go down twice in 4 actions.\n\ne.g., a0=D, to y1=1\n\na1=D, to y2=0 (since y=0 min)\n\na2=S, to y3=0\n\na3=S, to y4=0\n\nThen at k=4, y=0, safe.\n\nThen from there, go up.\n\ny=0 at k=4.\n\na4=U, to y5=1\n\na5=U, to y6=2\n\nk=6, y=2, safe\n\na6=U, to y7=3\n\nk=7, y=3, safe\n\na7=U, to y8=4\n\na8=U, to y9=5\n\na9=U, to y10=6\n\na10=U, to y11=7\n\na11=U, to y12=8\n\na12=U, to y13=9\n\nH=13, worse than before.\n\nSo better to be at y=1 at k=4.\n\nBut H=12 seems long, and we have the issue at k=6 and k=7 for y=7,8, but in this path we were not there at that time.\n\nBut perhaps we can reach faster by not going down so early or something.\n\nAnother idea: we can be on y=7 or 8 at k=4, but impossible.\n\nOr, we can delay or advance the time we are on certain rows.\n\nFor example, to avoid k=4 on y=2-6, we can be on those rows at other times.\n\nBut since we start at k=0 on y=2, and k=4 is only 4 steps away, we can only reach up to y=6 or down to y=0.\n\nSo no choice, at k=4 we must be low.\n\nBut H=12 for reaching at k=12.\n\nBut we might be able to reach earlier by going up faster after k=4 or before.\n\nAfter k=4, we are at y=1, and we need to go to y=9, which is 8 steps, but we can do it in 8 steps if no delays, but in the path above we did it in 8 steps from y=1 to y=9: from k=4 to k=12, that's 8 steps? k=4 y=1, k=5 y=2, ..., k=12 y=9, that's 8 actions: a4 to a11, 8 actions, positions from y5 to y12, 8 steps up.\n\nFrom y=1 to y=9, difference 8, so min 8 actions, so we did it in 8 actions from there, total from start.\n\nFrom k=0 to k=4, we used 4 actions to go from y0=2 to y4=1, which is down 1, so not efficient.\n\nBut we had to do that to avoid k=4 on middle.\n\nPerhaps we can go up to y=6 before k=4 and then move away.\n\nFor example, at k=3, we can be at y=5 (if we go up twice and stay once, etc.)\n\nLet's see possible positions at k=3.\n\ny3 from y0=2.\n\nAfter 3 actions, y3 = 2 + sum_{i=0}^2 Δy_i\n\ny3 can be from 0 to 5? Min: all D, but y min 0, so y3=0 if three downs, or 1, etc.\n\nMax y3=5 if all U: y1=3, y2=4, y3=5.\n\nAt k=3, y=5, safe since k=3 not unsafe for y=5.\n\nThen at k=3, we choose action a3.\n\nIf we go up, a3=U, then y4=6 at k=4, which is unsafe.\n\nIf we go down, a3=D, then y4=4 at k=4, unsafe.\n\nIf we stay, a3=S, y4=5 at k=4, unsafe since y=5 unsafe at k=4.\n\nSo if at k=3 we are on y=3,4, or 5, all of which at k=4 would be unsafe if we stay or go up/down to middle.\n\ny=3 at k=3, if a3=S, y4=3 unsafe; a3=U, y4=4 unsafe; a3=D, y4=2 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if at k=3 y=4, a3=S, y4=4 unsafe; U to 5 unsafe; D to 3 unsafe.\n\nIf y=5, similar.\n\nIf at k=3 we are on y=2, but y=2 at k=3: safe, since unsafe only at k=4.\n\nThen a3: if U, y4=3 unsafe; D, y4=1 safe; S, y4=2 unsafe.\n\nSo only down to y=1 is safe.\n\nIf at k=3 y=1, then a3=S, y4=1 safe; U to y4=2 unsafe; D to y4=0 safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 at k=3, a3=S, y4=0 safe; U to y4=1 safe; D not possible or to 0.\n\nBut from above, to avoid y4 in 2-6, we must have y3 such that we can go to y4=0 or 1 or 7-9, but 7-9 impossible.\n\ny4=0 or 1 only possible from y3=0 or 1 with S or U/D appropriately.\n\nSpecifically, if y3=0, then a3=S or U, y4=0 or 1.\n\nIf y3=1, a3=S or D, y4=1 or 0.\n\nIf y3=2, only a3=D to y4=1.\n\netc.\n\nBut in all cases, at k=4 we are at 0 or 1.\n\nSo no choice.\n\nThus, the only way to avoid collision at k=4 is to be at y=0 or 1 at k=4.\n\nThen from there, we go up.\n\nNow, to minimize H, we should reach y=1 at k=4 with minimal down, but since we need to go down at least once, it costs time.\n\nBut we also have to consider the later unsafe times at k=6 and 7 for y=7 and 8.\n\nIn the path to y=9, when we go up, we will pass y=7 and y=8, and we need to not be on them at k=6 or k=7.\n\nIn the earlier path, we were at low y at k=6 and k=7, so no problem.\n\nBut we can reach faster if we can be on y=7 or 8 after k=7.\n\nFor example, if we can reach y=9 in fewer than 12 turns.\n\nMinimum possible: from y=2 to y=9, 7 steps up, so H min 7, but we have to avoid k=4 on middle, which forces us to lose time.\n\nWithout constraint, min H=7, with constraint, more.\n\nBut in this case, we have to spend at least one turn not going up, or going down.\n\nIn the path to y=1 at k=4, we used one down move, so net we are behind.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach earlier than k=12.\n\nFor example, suppose at k=4, y=1.\n\nThen we need to go to y=9.\n\nThe earliest to reach y=9 is if we go up every turn from there.\n\ny=1 at k=4, a4=U, y5=2 at k=5\n\na5=U, y6=3 at k=6\n\na6=U, y7=4 at k=7\n\na7=U, y8=5 at k=8\n\na8=U, y9=6 at k=9\n\na9=U, y10=7 at k=10\n\na10=U, y11=8 at k=11\n\na11=U, y12=9 at k=12\n\nSame as before.\n\nAt k=6, we are at y=3, which is safe, and k=7 at y=4, safe.\n\nBut when we reach y=7 at k=10, which is after k=7, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut we can go faster? From y=1 at k=4, to y=9, min 8 actions, so at k=12.\n\nTotal from start: k=0 to k=4 is 4 turns, then 8 actions to y=9, so turn k=12.\n\nBut k=0 to k=4 includes the position at k=4 after 4 actions.\n\nNumber of turns: from turn t1 to t1+H, with y_H=9.\n\nAt turn t1 (k=0), we start, after H actions, at turn t1+H, y_H=9.\n\nIn this case, H=12.\n\nBut perhaps we can be at y=1 earlier or something.\n\nAnother idea: we don't have to stay at y=1 from k=1 to k=4; we can be at y=1 only at k=4.\n\nFor example, from start:\n\nk=0, y=2, safe\n\na0=S, to y1=2 at k=1\n\nk=1, y=2, safe (k=1 all safe)\n\na1=S, to y2=2 at k=2\n\nk=2, y=2, safe\n\na2=D, to y3=1 at k=3\n\nk=3, y=1, safe\n\na3=S, to y4=1 at k=4, safe\n\nThen same as before, y=1 at k=4.\n\nThen go up.\n\nOr a3=U, but y4=2 at k=4 unsafe, not possible.\n\nSo must be y=1 or 0 at k=4.\n\nWith y=1 at k=4, we can start going up.\n\nBut in the up path, we have to pass y=7 and y=8, and k=6 and k=7 are unsafe for them.\n\nBut at k=6 and k=7, we are at lower y, so ok.\n\nBut can we reach y=9 before k=12?\n\nFor example, if we can skip some levels or go faster, but we can only move one step per turn.\n\nUnless we are already high at k=4, but we are not.\n\nAnother thought: we can go down to y=0 or 1 at k=4, but then from there, to reach y=9 faster, impossible, 8 steps.\n\nPerhaps we can avoid the middle rows at k=4 by being on y=7 or 8, but impossible from start.\n\nOr, we can be on y=6 at a different time, but at k=4 it is unsafe, so we must not be on it at that exact time.\n\nBut since we can only move one step, we can't jump over.\n\nSo I think H=12 is the best so far.\n\nBut let's list the actions for this path.\n\nStart at k=0, y=2\n\nTo be at y=1 at k=4, one way: a0=D, to y1=1\n\nThen a1=S, to y2=1\n\na2=S, to y3=1\n\na3=S, to y4=1\n\nThen a4=U, to y5=2\n\na5=U, to y6=3\n\na6=U, to y7=4\n\na7=U, to y8=5\n\na8=U, to y9=6\n\na9=U, to y10=7\n\na10=U, to y11=8\n\na11=U, to y12=9\n\nNow, at each turn, check safety.\n\nk=0: y=2, Δt=0, unsafe? y=2 unsafe at k=4, not 0, safe.\n\nk=1: y=1, Δt=1, y=1 unsafe at k=14-17, not 1, safe.\n\nk=2: y=1, same, safe.\n\nk=3: y=1, safe.\n\nk=4: y=1, safe, as above.\n\nk=5: y=2, Δt=5, y=2 unsafe only at k=4, not 5, safe.\n\nk=6: y=3, Δt=6, y=3 unsafe only at k=4, not 6, safe.\n\nk=7: y=4, Δt=7, y=4 unsafe only at k=4, not 7, safe.\n\nk=8: y=5, safe, not unsafe time.\n\nk=9: y=6, safe.\n\nk=10: y=7, Δt=10, y=7 unsafe at k=6,7, not 10, safe.\n\nk=11: y=8, unsafe at k=6,7, not 11, safe.\n\nk=12: y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut H=12.\n\nNow, we have the later unsafe times for y=1 at k=14-17, but we are not on y=1 at that time, so ok.\n\nBut can we do better?\n\nPerhaps we don't need to go all the way to y=1; we can be at y=0 at k=4, but that might be worse.\n\nOr, we can go up to y=6 quickly and then at k=4 go down, but at k=4 if on y=6, it is unsafe, so we cannot be on it at k=4.\n\nFor example, suppose we go up to y=5 at k=3.\n\nHow? a0=U, to y1=3 at k=1\n\na1=U, to y2=4 at k=2\n\na2=U, to y3=5 at k=3\n\nAll safe so far.\n\nNow at k=3, y=5, safe.\n\nThen a3: if U, y4=6 at k=4 unsafe; if S, y4=5 unsafe; if D, y4=4 at k=4 unsafe.\n\nAll lead to unsafe at k=4.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nSimilarly, if we are at y=6 at k=3, but from y=2, in 3 steps, max y=5, cannot reach y=6 in 3 steps.\n\ny=6 at k=3 impossible.\n\nSo no way to be high at k=3 to avoid.\n\nThus, the only safe way at k=4 is to be at y=0 or 1.\n\nNow, to save time, we can be at y=1 at k=4 with fewer actions or less down, but we have to have y4=1.\n\nFor example, instead of going down at k=0, we can stay at y=2 for some turns and go down later.\n\nBut net, to have y4=1, we need at least one down move in the first 4 actions.\n\nFor example: a0=S, y1=2\n\na1=S, y2=2\n\na2=D, y3=1\n\na3=S, y4=1\n\nThen same as before, y=1 at k=4.\n\nOr a0=S, y1=2\n\na1=D, y2=1\n\na2=S, y3=1\n\na3=S, y4=1\n\nStill, we have one down move, and we are at y=1 at k=4.\n\nThen the up path is the same.\n\nSo no savings.\n\nPerhaps after k=4, we can go up faster, but we can't.\n\nAnother idea: to avoid the k=6 and k=7 for y=7 and 8, but in this path we pass them late, so no issue.\n\nBut perhaps we can reach y=9 earlier if we go directly but wait somewhere.\n\nFor example, suppose at start, we go up to y=6 but before k=4.\n\nAt k=3, we can be at y=5, as above.\n\nBut then at k=3, we have to go down to y=4 or something, but at k=4 y=4 unsafe.\n\nSo we must go down to y=1 at k=4.\n\nUnless we can be on y=7 at k=4, impossible.\n\nPerhaps we can delay or advance the time.\n\nAnother thought: since the unsafe times are fixed, and we have to avoid being on those y at those k, we might take a different path, like go down to y=0 first or something, but that would take more time.\n\nFor example, go to y=0 immediately.\n\na0=D, to y1=1\n\na1=D, to y2=0\n\nThen at k=2, y=0, safe.\n\nBut we need to go to y=9, from y=0, min 9 steps, so at least k=11, but with the k=4 constraint, we might be better or worse.\n\nAt k=4, we can be at y=0 easily.\n\nBut from y=0 at k=2, we can start going up.\n\na2=U, to y3=1\n\na3=U, to y4=2\n\nBut at k=4, y=2, unsafe! Because y=2 unsafe at k=4.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt k=4, if we are at y=2, collision.\n\nSo we need to not be at y=2 at k=4.\n\nIn this case, at k=4, y=2, unsafe.\n\nSo we must avoid that.\n\nFor example, from y2=0 at k=2, we can stay or go up slowly.\n\nBut to avoid y=2 at k=4.\n\nSo at k=4, we must be y=0 or 1.\n\nSo from k=2, y=0, a2=S, y3=0, a3=S, y4=0\n\nThen at k=4, y=0 safe.\n\nThen a4=U, y5=1, etc., similar to before, but we started from lower, so it takes more turns to reach y=9.\n\nFor example, y4=0, a4=U,y5=1, a5=U,y6=2, a6=U,y7=3, a7=U,y8=4, a8=U,y9=5, a9=U,y10=6, a10=U,y11=7, a11=U,y12=8, a12=U,y13=9, H=13, worse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nThus, the first path with H=12 seems best.\n\nBut we have the freeway 6 with two cars, but we handled it.\n\nNow, about y=7 and 8 unsafe at k=6 and 7.\n\nIn our path, at k=6 we are at y=3, not 7 or 8, so safe.\n\nSimilarly k=7 at y=4.\n\nBut suppose we want to reach faster, we could be at higher y earlier, but we are constrained by k=4.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps we can be on y=8 or 9 at k=4, but impossible.\n\nOr, we can go up to y=6 before k=4, but at k=4 we have to leave, but we can't because moving away still puts us on adjacent row at k=4.\n\nUnless we are on y=7 at k=4, impossible.\n\nI think H=12 is the minimum.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can do with H=11 or less.\n\nSuppose we reach y=9 at k=11.\n\nThen y11=9.\n\nThat means from y0=2, in 11 actions, we need net +7, so at least 7 up moves, and 4 other actions (stay or down).\n\nBut with the constraint that at k=4, y4 must be 0 or 1.\n\ny4 must be 0 or 1.\n\nSince y0=2, to have y4=0 or 1, we need at least one down move in first 4 actions.\n\nThen, to reach y11=9, from y4=1, we need to go to y=9 in 7 actions, which requires exactly 8 up moves but only 7 actions? From k=4 to k=11, there are 7 actions: a4 to a10, determining y5 to y11.\n\ny4 at k=4, after a4, y5 at k=5, ..., after a10, y11 at k=11.\n\nSo from y4 to y11, 7 actions, 7 steps.\n\ny11 = y4 + sum of Δy from a4 to a10.\n\ny4 <=1, y11=9, so net increase at least 8, but only 7 actions, so impossible to increase by 8 in 7 steps, since each action at most +1.\n\nMax increase 7, so y11 <= y4 + 7 <= 1 + 7 = 8 < 9.\n\nCannot reach y=9 at k=11 if y4 <=1.\n\nIf y4=0, y11 <=0+7=7<9.\n\nThus impossible to reach y=9 at k=11.\n\nSimilarly, for k=10, even worse.\n\ny10=9, but from y4<=1, y10 <= y4 +6 <=1+6=7<9.\n\nImpossible.\n\nEarliest possible is k=12 with y4=1, y12=1+8=9.\n\nWith y4=0, y12=0+8=8<9, cannot reach, need more steps.\n\ny4=0, then y12 <=0+8=8, so at k=12 y=8, then need another action to go to y=9 at k=13.\n\nWorse.\n\nThus, minimal H is 12, with y4=1.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we also need to avoid the k=6 and k=7 for y=7 and 8, but in the path we are not on them at that time.\n\nIn the up part, we can go faster? No.\n\nBut at k=6 and k=7, we are at y=3 and y=4, which are safe.\n\nWe could be at y=9 before k=12 if possible, but not.\n\nPerhaps we can have y4=1, and then go up, but when we reach y=7, we need to not be at k=6 or 7, but k=6 and 7 are early, we are at y=7 later.\n\nIn this case, no conflict.\n\nAnother thing: freeway 6 has a second car, but we saw it never covers x=0, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nBut in the sequence, at k=1,2,3 we are at y=1, which is safe, and we go up later.\n\nTo write the actions.\n\nCurrent turn t1=56.\n\nActions for turn t1 + t for t=0 to 11.\n\nt from 0 to 11, 12 actions.\n\nAction at turn 56: a_{56}, which is a0 in my notation.\n\nIn the sequence: turn t1: a_{t1} for t=0.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t1: a_{t1}, Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}, etc.\n\nSo for t1=56.\n\nNow, in the path: a0 = D (down) to go to y=1\n\nThen a1=S (stay), a2=S, a3=S to stay at y=1 until k=4.\n\nThen a4=U (up), a5=U, a6=U, a7=U, a8=U, a9=U, a10=U, a11=U to go up to y=9.\n\nIn terms of actions:\n\nAt turn 56: action D (since a0=D)\n\nTurn 57: action S (a1=S)\n\nTurn 58: action S (a2=S)\n\nTurn 59: action S (a3=S)\n\nNow at turn 59, after action S, position at turn 60 is y=1? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 56 (k=0), position y=2\n\nAction a_{56} = D, so move down, to position at turn 57: y=1\n\nAt turn 57 (k=1), position y=1\n\nAction a_{57} = S, so stay, position turn 58: y=1\n\nAt turn 58 (k=2), position y=1\n\nAction a_{58} = S, position turn 59: y=1\n\nAt turn 59 (k=3), position y=1\n\nAction a_{59} = S, position turn 60: y=1\n\nTurn 60 is k=4, position y=1\n\nThen action a_{60} = U, position turn 61: y=2\n\nAnd so on.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to list actions for turns starting from t1=56.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 56: D\n\nTurn 57: S\n\nTurn 58: S\n\nTurn 59: S\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: U  (to y=3)\n\nAfter a_{60}=U at turn 60, position at turn 61 is y=2? No.\n\nAt turn 60 (k=4), position y=1\n\nAction a_{60} = U, so after action, position at turn 61: y=2\n\nSimilarly, at turn 61 (k=5), position y=2\n\nAction a_{61} = U, to position turn 62: y=3\n\nTurn 62 (k=6), position y=3\n\nAction a_{62} = U, to position turn 63: y=4\n\nTurn 63 (k=7), position y=4\n\nAction a_{63} = U, to position turn 64: y=5\n\nTurn 64 (k=8), position y=5\n\nAction a_{64} = U, to turn 65: y=6\n\nTurn 65 (k=9), position y=6\n\nAction a_{65} = U, to turn 66: y=7\n\nTurn 66 (k=10), position y=7\n\nAction a_{66} = U, to turn 67: y=8\n\nTurn 67 (k=11), position y=8\n\nAction a_{67} = U, to turn 68: y=9\n\nReached at turn 68.\n\nNow, turns: from 56 to 67 actions, 12 actions, reach at turn 68.\n\nIn the sequence, actions for turn 56 to 67.\n\nH=12.\n\nIn the answer, we need to list the actions.\n\nBut we can have a different sequence to reach with H=12.\n\nFor example, instead of going down immediately, we can stay first.\n\nBut same number.\n\nNow, about the unsafe at k=6 and k=7 for y=7 and 8.\n\nIn this path, at k=6, we are at y=3, not 7 or 8.\n\nAt k=7, y=4.\n\nWhen we are at y=7 at k=10, safe.\n\nBut suppose we want to be at y=7 earlier, but we can't because we were delayed by the down move.\n\nAnother path: perhaps go to y=6 quickly, but then at k=4 we have to be low, so we must leave before, but we can't.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nBut in the beginning, for freeway 1, unsafe at k=14-17, but in this path, at k=14, we are at, let's see.\n\nk=10: y=7\n\nk=11: y=8\n\nk=12: y=9? In my earlier, at k=12 position y=9, but k is the time index.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 68 (k=12), position y=9.\n\nk=12 corresponds to Δt=12.\n\nAt k=14, Δt=14, which is turn t1+14=56+14=70.\n\nAt that time, if we were on y=1, but in the path, at k=14, where are we?\n\nSince we reached at k=12, we don't care after, but during the path, we are not on y=1 at high k.\n\nIn this case, at k=14, we are already at y=9 or beyond, but since we reached at k=12, we stop, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo the sequence should be ok.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 6, there is a second car at (24,13,right,12), but we saw it never covers x=0, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo I think H=12 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach with H=11 by being at y=1 at k=4 but with faster up.\n\nBut as before, impossible.\n\nSuppose we go down less, but y4 must be 1 or 0, so we have to have at least one down in the first 4 actions.\n\nIn the up part, we have exactly 8 up moves from y=1 to y=9, no choice.\n\nThus H=12.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions:\n\nFor turn 56: D\n\nTurn 57: S\n\nTurn 58: S\n\nTurn 59: S\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: U\n\nTurn 62: U\n\nTurn 63: U\n\nTurn 64: U\n\nTurn 65: U\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: U\n\nAfter turn 67 action U, at turn 68 position y=9.\n\nNow, in the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 56: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 57: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 58: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 59: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 60: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 61: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 62: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 63: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 64: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 65: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 66: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 67: U \\end{array} }\n\nBut H=12, and we have 12 actions from turn 56 to 67.\n\nIn the box, it should be the sequence.\n\nSince the player reaches at turn 68, which is t1 + 12.\n\nt1=56, t1+H=56+12=68.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps we can have a sequence where we go up earlier after k=4, but same.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 7 and 8, there are two cars each, but we considered only the one that can cover x=0.\n\nFor example, freeway 7: first car causes unsafe at k=6,7, second car never.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think it's correct.\n\nSo the minimal H is 12.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 2) at turn 56, the minimal number of turns required is 12. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8 by ensuring the player is not on an unsafe freeway at the corresponding unsafe times.\n\n### Unsafe Times for Freeways:\n- Freeway 2, 3, 4, 5, 6: Unsafe at Δt = 4 (turn 60 relative to turn 56).\n- Freeway 7 and 8: Unsafe at Δt = 6 and 7 (turns 62 and 63 relative to turn 56).\n- Freeway 1: Unsafe at Δt = 14 to 17, but this does not affect the path as the player is not on y=1 at these times.\n\n### Strategy:\n- From turn 56 to turn 59, the player moves to y=1 and stays there to avoid being on freeways 2-6 at turn 60 (unsafe at Δt=4).\n- From turn 60 onwards, the player moves up continuously to reach y=9. At turns 62 and 63 (unsafe for y=7 and 8), the player is on y=3 and y=4, which are safe.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions for turns 56 to 67 ensures the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 68 (turn 56 + 12) without collisions.\n\n- Turn 56: D (move down to y=1 at turn 57).\n- Turn 57: S (stay at y=1 at turn 58).\n- Turn 58: S (stay at y=1 at turn 59).\n- Turn 59: S (stay at y=1 at turn 60).\n- Turn 60: U (move up to y=2 at turn 61; safe as y=2 is unsafe only at turn 60).\n- Turn 61: U (move up to y=3 at turn 62; safe as y=3 is unsafe only at turn 60).\n- Turn 62: U (move up to y=4 at turn 63; safe as y=4 is unsafe only at turn 60, and y=7/8 unsafe at turn 62 but player is on y=3).\n- Turn 63: U (move up to y=5 at turn 64; safe as y=5 is unsafe only at turn 60, and y=7/8 unsafe at turn 63 but player is on y=4).\n- Turn 64: U (move up to y=6 at turn 65; safe as y=6 is unsafe only at turn 60).\n- Turn 65: U (move up to y=7 at turn 66; safe as y=7 is unsafe only at turns 62-63, and turn 66 is later).\n- Turn 66: U (move up to y=8 at turn 67; safe as y=8 is unsafe only at turns 62-63, and turn 67 is later).\n- Turn 67: U (move up to y=9 at turn 68; y=9 has no freeway, so safe).\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in 12 turns, the minimum possible, as it is impossible to reach y=9 in fewer than 12 turns due to the constraint of avoiding freeways 2-6 at turn 60, which requires being at y≤1 at that turn, limiting the maximum progress.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 56: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 57: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 58: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 59: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 60: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 61: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 62: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 63: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 64: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 65: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 66: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 67: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up, down, or stay each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that exact turn. Also, when moving, you're not on the new row until the next turn, so you only check the row you're currently on for collision.\n\nThe cars are moving left or right at constant speeds. For right-moving cars, the span increases to the right; for left-moving, it increases to the left. But in the span notation, for left-moving, it's given as (head, tail) where head is the front, so for left-moving, head is left, tail is right? Let me read carefully.\n\nThe car update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, decreasing x, so the whole span shifts left. [h, τ] with h and τ, but it says head at h, tail at τ. For left-moving, if it's moving left, head should be on the left, so h < τ? But in the span [h, τ], if h is head and left, then h < τ, so [h, τ] means from h to τ, with h left, τ right? But if it's moving left, when it moves, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nThis is confusing. Let me parse.\n\nFor left-moving: \"head is at h, tail is at τ\" and span is [h, τ]. Since moving left, after time, span becomes [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt], so if h and τ are positions, and moving left, positions decrease.\n\nBut in the span, it's written as [h, τ], which might imply h is left if h < τ.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" which might be a notation where τ is tail, h is head, so for right-moving, tail is left, head is right, so [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nThen after moving, [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt], so it shifts right.\n\nIn collision, we care about whether x=0 is in the span at turn T.\n\nNow, for each freeway, we have cars listed.\n\nCurrent turn t1 = 58.\n\nPlayer at y=3.\n\nCars:\n\nFreeway 1: one car, (-36, -47, right, 3)\n\nBut direction is right, but span is given as (-36, -47). If it's right-moving, span should be [τ, h] with τ < h, but here head -36, tail -47? -36 > -47, so if tail is -47, head is -36, then τ = -47, h = -36, so [τ, h] = [-47, -36], which makes sense for right-moving, since τ left, h right.\n\nIn the table, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor freeway 1: head h=-36, tail τ=-47, direction right, speed 3.\n\nSince direction right, head should be on the right, so h > τ, -36 > -47, yes, so τ = -47, h = -36, so the span is from τ to h, which is from -47 to -36.\n\nAt time t, span is [τ + s(t - t1), h + s(t - t1)] for right-moving? Let's see the update.\n\nGeneral update: for right-moving, from t1 to T, span becomes [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] but with head and tail as given.\n\nIn this case, freeway 1: direction right, so at turn T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-47 + 3(T-58), -36 + 3(T-58)]\n\nCollision if at turn T, player is on this freeway and 0 is in [ -47 + 3(T-58), -36 + 3(T-58) ]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, freeway 2: (-24, -35, right, 12) so head -24, tail -35, direction right, speed 12.\n\nSo τ = -35, h = -24? Head is given as -24, tail as -35, so since right, head should be right, so if tail is -35, head -24, -24 > -35, yes, so span [τ, h] = [-35, -24] at t1.\n\nAt T, [ -35 + 12(T-58), -24 + 12(T-58) ]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 3,4,5: same as freeway 2? Freeway 3,4,5 all have the same: (-24, -35, right, 12)\n\nBut freeway 3,4,5 each have one car, I assume.\n\nThe table says for freeway 6: two cars, (-24, -35, right, 12) and (48, 37, right, 12)\n\n(48,37, right,12): head 48, tail 37? 48 > 37, so tail 37, head 48, so [37,48] at t1.\n\nSimilarly, first car (-24,-35,right,12) same as others.\n\nFreeway 7: two cars, (-24,-35,right,6) and (24,13,right,6)\n\nFirst car: head -24, tail -35, so τ=-35, h=-24, [ -35, -24 ] at t1 with speed 6.\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,6) head 24, tail 13, so τ=13, h=24, [13,24] at t1, speed 6.\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7: (-24,-35,right,6) and (24,13,right,6)\n\nNow, the player starts at y=3 at turn t1=58.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H is at least 6, since from 3 to 9 is 6 steps up, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so H could be more.\n\nBut since I can only move one step per turn, minimum H is 6 if I can go straight up without collision.\n\nSo first, I should check if going straight up from y=3 to y=9 in 6 turns is possible, meaning for each turn from t=58 to t=63, when I'm on y_t, no car on that row has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nStart at t=58, y=3. At turn 58, I am on y=3. Is there a collision at t=58 on y=3?\n\nFreeway 3 has cars? Freeway 3 is y=3.\n\nCars on freeway 3: from table, freeway 3 has one car: (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nAt turn t=58, which is t1, so T=t1=58.\n\nSpan for this car: at T=58, [τ + s(0), h + s(0)] = [-35, -24] since s(58-58)=0.\n\nIs 0 in [-35, -24]? -35 to -24, all negative, 0 not in, so no collision at t=58 on y=3.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for t=58,59,60,... up to when I reach y=9.\n\nSince I start at t=58, position (0,3), I take actions at t=58, t=59, etc., and after H actions, at turn t=58+H-1, I am at y=9.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn 58, y=3.\n\nAfter first action at t=58, I move to new y at turn 59.\n\nAfter action at t, I move to y_{t+1} at turn t+1.\n\nSo to reach y=9, I need to be at y=9 at some turn T.\n\nSet T such that y_T = 9.\n\nI start at turn t=58, y=3.\n\nI take actions a_{58}, a_{59}, ..., a_{T-1} to reach y_T=9.\n\nThe number of actions is H = T - 58.\n\ny changes from 3 to 9, so minimum H=6, T=64.\n\nIf I go up every turn, from t=58 to t=63, I set a_t=U for t=58 to 62, then at t=63, y=9, but let's see the turns.\n\nAt turn 58: y=3, after a_58, y_{59} = y_58 + Δy, so if a_58=U, y_59=4.\n\nSimilarly, if a_58=U, at turn 59, y=4.\n\nThen a_59=U, turn 60, y=5, and so on, up to a_62=U, turn 63, y=8 +1=9? Start y58=3.\n\nt=58, y=3\n\na58=U, t=59, y=4\n\na59=U, t=60, y=5\n\na60=U, t=61, y=6\n\na61=U, t=62, y=7\n\na62=U, t=63, y=8\n\na63=U, t=64, y=9\n\nBut I need to reach y=9, so at turn t=64, y=9.\n\nWith actions from t=58 to t=63, 6 actions, H=6, turns from 58 to 63 inclusive? Actions at t=58 to t=63, that's 6 actions, after which at turn 64, y=9.\n\nThe sequence {a_t} for t from t1 to t1+H-1, so for H=6, t=58 to 63.\n\nAnd at turn t=64, y=9, which is after the last action.\n\nIn the position, at turn T, we have y_T.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn T when we are on y_T.\n\nFor the path to be safe, for each turn from t=58 to t=63 (since at t=64 we are at y=9, and no need to check? At t=64, we are at (0,9), which is the goal, and freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=9 has no cars, so no collision possible at y=9. So we only care about turns from 58 to 63 when we are on y=3 to y=8.\n\nIn the sequence, when we are moving, at turn T, we are on y_T, and we might be on freeway y_T if y_T between 1 and 8.\n\nFor example, at turn 58, y=3, freeway 3.\n\nAt turn 59, if y=4, freeway 4, and so on, up to turn 63, y=8, freeway 8.\n\nAt turn 64, y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nSo for the direct path: actions U,U,U,U,U,U at t=58 to 63.\n\nNow check for each turn from 58 to 63, on the corresponding freeway, whether 0 is in any car's span at that turn.\n\nFirst, turn 58: y=3, freeway 3.\n\nCar on y=3: (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nAt T=58, span: as above, [-35, -24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 59: y=4, freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 4 has car: (-24,-35,right,12) same as above.\n\nAt T=59, Δt= T-t1 =59-58=1\n\nSpan: [ -35 + 12(1), -24 + 12(1) ] = [ -35+12, -24+12] = [-23, -12]\n\n0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 60: y=5, freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 5: same car type, (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nAt T=60, Δt=2\n\nSpan: [ -35 + 12*2, -24 + 12*2] = [ -35+24, -24+24] = [-11, 0]\n\n-11 to 0, inclusive? 0 is included, since span [a,b] includes a and b, I assume.\n\nIs 0 in [-11, 0]? Yes, 0 is the right endpoint.\n\nSo at turn 60, on freeway 5, 0 is in the span, collision!\n\nSo if I go to y=5 at turn 60, I collide with the car on freeway 5.\n\nTherefore, direct path has collision at turn 60.\n\nSo I cannot go directly to y=5 at turn 60.\n\nI need to avoid that.\n\nNow, other freeways might have issues.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars and when they occupy x=0.\n\nFor each freeway, for each car, find when 0 is in the span.\n\nGeneral: for a car, at turn T, span depends on direction.\n\nFirst, for right-moving cars: span at T: [τ + s(T-58), h + s(T-58)]\n\n0 in span if τ + s(T-58) ≤ 0 ≤ h + s(T-58)\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but in this case, all cars given are right-moving, I think.\n\nIn the table, all directions are \"right\", so no left-moving cars.\n\nFreeway 1: direction right, freeway 2 to 8 all right, except freeway 6 has two, both right, etc.\n\nAll cars are right-moving.\n\nSo for a right-moving car with head h, tail τ, speed s at t1=58.\n\n0 in span at T if τ + s(T-58) ≤ 0 ≤ h + s(T-58)\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\nτ + s(T-58) ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ h + s(T-58)\n\nOr\n\n-τ / s ≥ T-58 ≥ -h / s ? Let's solve inequality.\n\nFrom τ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt, where Δt = T-58\n\nSo τ + s Δt ≤ 0 and h + s Δt ≥ 0\n\nSo s Δt ≤ -τ and s Δt ≥ -h\n\nSince s>0, Δt ≤ -τ/s and Δt ≥ -h/s\n\nBut since τ < h, -τ/s > -h/s, so Δt must satisfy -h/s ≤ Δt ≤ -τ/s\n\nThen T = 58 + Δt must have ceil and floor since T integer, but since span is continuous, we need to find integer T where the interval contains 0.\n\nSimilarly, the car occupies x=0 when T-58 is between -h/s and -τ/s inclusive? Let's see.\n\nFrom above: Δt min = ceil( -h/s )? Better to compute numerically.\n\nFor freeway 1: car (-36,-47,right,3) so h=-36, τ=-47, s=3\n\nThen 0 in span when τ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt\n\n-47 + 3 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -36 + 3 Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -47 + 3 Δt ≤ 0 => 3 Δt ≤ 47 => Δt ≤ 47/3 ≈ 15.666, so Δt <= 15 since integer? Δt integer.\n\n-47 + 3 Δt ≤ 0 => 3 Δt ≤ 47 => Δt ≤ 47/3 = 15.666, so Δt <= 15\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -36 + 3 Δt => 36 ≤ 3 Δt => Δt >= 12\n\nSo Δt >=12 and Δt <=15\n\nThus for T=58 + Δt, T from 70 to 73? Δt from 12 to 15, T=70,71,72,73\n\nBut we are only going to be around turn 60 something, not that far, so for now, not relevant.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: car (-24,-35,right,12) h=-24, τ=-35, s=12\n\n0 in span when:\n\nτ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt\n\n-35 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -24 + 12 Δt\n\nFirst: -35 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 => 12 Δt ≤ 35 => Δt <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so Δt <=2\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -24 + 12 Δt => 24 <= 12 Δt => Δt >=2\n\nSo Δt >=2 and Δt <=2, thus Δt=2, T=58+2=60\n\nSo only at turn 60, 0 in span for this car.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same car, (-24,-35,right,12), so same as above, only at T=60, collision if on y=3 at T=60.\n\nFreeway 3 car at T=60: but freeway 3 is y=3.\n\nAt T=60, if on y=3, collision.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same car, same, at T=60 collision if on y=4? No, freeway 4 has its own car, but same parameters, so also at T=60 collision if on y=4 at T=60.\n\nFreeway 4 car: (-24,-35,right,12), so yes, same as freeway 2 and 3, each has such a car.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4,5 all have identical cars: (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nSo for each, at T=60, if on that freeway, collision.\n\nNow freeway 5: same, at T=60 collision.\n\nNow freeway 6: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-24,-35,right,12), same as above, so at T=60, if on freeway 6 and this car, collision.\n\nSecond car: (48,37,right,12) head 48, tail 37, so τ=37, h=48, s=12\n\n0 in span when:\n\nτ + s Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s Δt\n\n37 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 48 + 12 Δt\n\nFirst: 37 + 12 Δt ≤ 0? 12 Δt ≤ -37, but Δt >=0, s Δt >=0, 37>0, so 37 + 12 Δt >0, never <=0, so first inequality false for all Δt. Thus 0 never in span for this car? Because the span is from 37 to 48, all positive, moving right, so always positive, never reaches x=0 since starting from 37>0.\n\nSimilarly, at any T, min of span is 37 + s Δt >0, so 0 never in span. So this car never causes collision on freeway 6.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-24,-35,right,6) h=-24, τ=-35, s=6\n\n0 in span when:\n\n-35 + 6 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -24 + 6 Δt\n\nFirst: -35 + 6 Δt <=0 => 6 Δt <=35 => Δt <= 35/6 ≈ 5.833, Δt <=5\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 + 6 Δt => 24 <= 6 Δt => Δt >=4\n\nSo Δt >=4 and Δt <=5, so Δt=4 or 5, T=62 or 63\n\nSimilarly, second car on freeway 7: (24,13,right,6) head 24, tail 13, so τ=13, h=24, s=6\n\n0 in span when:\n\n13 + 6 Δt <=0 <= 24 + 6 Δt\n\nFirst: 13 + 6 Δt <=0? 6 Δt <= -13, impossible since Δt>=0, so never. So only first car matters.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8: same cars as freeway 7, so at T=62 and 63, if on freeway 7 or 8, collision with the first car.\n\nNow, back to the player.\n\nI need to go from y=3 to y=9.\n\nWith direct path: at turn 60, y=5, freeway 5, which has a car that causes collision at T=60, so not safe.\n\nSimilarly, if I were on y=3 at T=60, collision, but in direct path, at T=60, I am at y=5, not y=3.\n\nIn direct path: t=58, y=3; t=59, y=4; t=60, y=5; t=61, y=6; t=62, y=7; t=63, y=8; t=64, y=9.\n\nAt t=60, y=5, freeway 5, car at T=60 causes collision.\n\nAt t=62, y=7, freeway 7, which has a car that causes collision at T=62 and 63.\n\nAt T=62, freeway 7 car: with s=6, Δt=4, span: -35 + 6*4 = -35+24= -11, h + s Δt = -24 + 24 =0? Δt=4, -24 + 6*4 = -24+24=0, τ + s Δt = -35 + 24 = -11\n\nSo span [-11, 0], 0 included, collision.\n\nSimilarly at T=63, Δt=5, τ + s Δt = -35 + 30 = -5, h + s Δt = -24 + 30 =6, span [-5,6], 0 in, collision.\n\nSo at t=62, if on y=7, collision; at t=63, if on y=8, freeway 8 has same, collision at T=63.\n\nIn direct path, at t=62, y=7, collision; at t=63, y=8, collision; and at t=60, y=5, collision. Multiple collisions.\n\nSo direct path not possible.\n\nI need to delay or change path to avoid being on certain rows at certain turns.\n\nSpecifically, I need to avoid:\n\n- Being on freeway 2,3,4,5 at turn 60? Freeway 2,3,4,5 all have collision at T=60.\n\nBut freeway 2 is y=2, etc.\n\nAt T=60, if on y=2,3,4,5, collision, since each has a car that causes collision at T=60.\n\ny=2,3,4,5 all have such cars.\n\ny=1: freeway 1 car, but at T=60, for freeway 1, earlier we had Δt=12 to15, T=70-73, not around 60, so at T=60, freeway 1 car span: Δt=2, τ + s Δt = -47 + 3*2 = -47+6=-41, h + s Δt = -36+6=-30, span [-41,-30], 0 not in, safe.\n\ny=6: freeway 6 has two cars. First car same as others, at T=60, collision if present. Second car no issue.\n\nBut at T=60, freeway 6 first car causes collision.\n\ny=7: freeway 7, at T=60, Δt=2, for first car: τ + s Δt = -35 + 6*2 = -35+12=-23, h + s Δt = -24+12=-12, span [-23,-12], 0 not in. Second car no issue. So safe at T=60.\n\nSimilarly y=8: similar, safe at T=60.\n\nNow at T=62 and 63, freeway 7 and 8 have collisions.\n\nSpecifically, at T=62, freeway 7 collision; T=63, freeway 7 and 8 collision? Freeway 7 at T=62 and T=63, freeway 8 same.\n\nBut at T=62, freeway 7 collision; T=63, freeway 8 collision since both have cars.\n\nNow, I start at y=3, t=58.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimum turns is 6, but with collisions, I may need to wait or detour.\n\nSince I can only move one per turn, and y must be integer, I need to be at certain y at certain times to avoid.\n\nList the danger times:\n\n- At turn 60: avoid y=2,3,4,5 (since all have collision)\n\ny=2,3,4,5 all have the car that causes collision at T=60.\n\ny=1,6,7,8 safe at T=60.\n\ny=9 not freeway.\n\n- At turn 62: avoid y=7 (freeway 7 collision)\n\n- At turn 63: avoid y=7 and y=8? Freeway 7 collision at T=63, freeway 8 collision at T=63.\n\nAt T=62, freeway 7 collision, so avoid y=7 at T=62.\n\nAt T=63, freeway 7 collision and freeway 8 collision, so avoid y=7 and y=8 at T=63.\n\nAlso, at other times, might be safe, but need to check.\n\nFor example, at turn 61: what happens.\n\nAt T=61, for freeway 5, say, car: Δt=3, for y=5 car, s=12, τ + s Δt = -35 + 36 =1, h + s Δt = -24 + 36 =12, span [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 7, at T=61, Δt=3, first car: τ + s Δt = -35 + 18 = -17, h + s Δt = -24 + 18 = -6, span [-17,-6], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo at T=61, all freeways safe, I think.\n\nSimilarly, turn 59: T=59, Δt=1\n\nFor y=3 car: span [ -35 +12(1), -24 +12(1)] = [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\ny=4 similar, etc.\n\nOnly specific turns have issues.\n\nNow, back to path.\n\nI need to be at y=9 by some turn.\n\nSince min H=6, let's see if I can do with H=6, arriving at turn 64.\n\nBut with actions from t=58 to 63.\n\nNow, at turn 60, I need to not be on y=2,3,4,5.\n\nSince y must be between 0 and 9, possible y at T=60 are 0,1,6,7,8,9 but y=9 not yet, so 0,1,6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly, at T=62, avoid y=7.\n\nAt T=63, avoid y=7 and y=8.\n\nNow, start from t=58, y=3.\n\nI need to choose actions.\n\nOne way is to go down to y=1 or up to y=6 by turn 60, but let's see the sequence.\n\nLet me denote the position at each turn.\n\nTurn t=58: y=3, must take action a58.\n\nIf I go up, to y=4 at t=59.\n\nBut at t=59, y=4, which is safe? At t=59, no collision issues, as earlier.\n\nThen at t=59, I can choose action.\n\nBut at t=60, I need to not be on y=2,3,4,5.\n\nSo from t=59, if y=4, and I go down, to y=3 at t=60, but y=3 is bad at t=60.\n\nIf I stay, y=4 at t=60, bad.\n\nIf I go up, to y=5 at t=60, bad.\n\nSo if I am at y=4 at t=59, all actions lead to bad y at t=60 except if I can go to y=6, but from y=4, I can only go to y=3,4,5 at next turn, so all bad for t=60.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be at y=4 at t=59, because from there, I must go to y=3,4, or5 at t=60, all of which are forbidden.\n\nSimilarly, if I am at y=3 at t=59, I can go to y=2,3,4 at t=60, all bad except y=2 is also bad at t=60? y=2 is freeway 2, which has collision at t=60.\n\ny=2,3,4,5 all bad at t=60.\n\nSo from y=3 at t=59, if I go down to y=2, bad; stay y=3, bad; up to y=4, bad. All bad.\n\nIf at y=5 at t=59, similarly, go to y=4,5,6 at t=60; y=4 and5 bad, y=6 might be good.\n\ny=6 at t=60: freeway 6, which has a car that causes collision at t=60, as earlier. Freeway 6 first car same as others, so at t=60 collision. So y=6 also bad at t=60.\n\nThus, at t=60, y=2,3,4,5,6 all have collision? y=6 too?\n\nFreeway 6: at t=60, first car: (-24,-35,right,12), same as others, so yes, at t=60, collision if on y=6.\n\ny=7: at t=60, as earlier, safe.\n\ny=8: safe.\n\ny=1: safe.\n\ny=0: safe, but y=0 is not freeway, no cars, always safe.\n\ny=9 not yet.\n\nSo at t=60, only safe y are 0,1,7,8.\n\nSimilarly, at t=62, avoid y=7.\n\nAt t=63, avoid y=7 and y=8.\n\nNow back to start.\n\nAt t=58, y=3.\n\nI need to be at a safe y at t=60, so y=0,1,7, or8.\n\nBut from y=3, in two turns, I can reach:\n\nAfter two actions: from t=58 to t=60.\n\nAt t=58, after a58, y at t=59.\n\nThen after a59, y at t=60.\n\nPossible:\n\n- If I go down twice: a58=D, t=59 y=2; a59=D, t=60 y=1 (safe)\n\n- a58=D, a59=S, t=60 y=2 (but y=2 bad at t=60)\n\n- a58=D, a59=U, t=60 y=3 (bad)\n\n- a58=S, a59=D, t=60 y=2 (bad)\n\n- a58=S, a59=S, t=60 y=3 (bad)\n\n- a58=S, a59=U, t=60 y=4 (bad)\n\n- a58=U, a59=D, t=60 y=4 (bad)\n\n- a58=U, a59=S, t=60 y=4 (bad)\n\n- a58=U, a59=U, t=60 y=5 (bad)\n\nThe only way to be safe at t=60 is to be at y=1, which requires going down twice: a58=D, a59=D, to y=1 at t=60.\n\ny=1 is safe at t=60.\n\nI could go to y=7 or 8, but from y=3, in two steps, maximum up to y=5, cannot reach y=7 or 8.\n\nSimilarly, y=0, but y=1 is possible.\n\nSo only possibility to be safe at t=60 is to be at y=1 at t=60.\n\nThus, I must go down: a58=D and a59=D.\n\nThen at t=60, y=1.\n\nNow, from there, I need to go to y=9.\n\ny=1 at t=60.\n\nNow, t=60, I take action a60.\n\nI can go up, down, or stay.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9, so probably up.\n\nAlso, need to avoid later collisions.\n\nNow, at t=62, I need to avoid y=7.\n\nAt t=63, avoid y=7 and y=8.\n\nNow, from t=60, y=1, I go up.\n\nLet me list turns: t=60, y=1\n\na60: if U, t=61 y=2\n\na61: then to y=3,4,etc.\n\nBut at t=62, I need not on y=7.\n\nt=63 not on y=7 or 8.\n\nAlso, since I need to reach y=9, let's see min time.\n\nFrom y=1 to y=9, need 8 steps up, but I can do faster or slower.\n\nCurrent turn t=60, y=1.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn T, with actions from t=60 to T-1.\n\nMin turns from here: 8 up actions, arrive at t=68.\n\nBut I started at t=58, so total turns from start.\n\nI need to minimize H, the number of actions from t1=58.\n\nCurrently at t=60, after two actions, I have taken a58 and a59.\n\nNow from t=60, I need to go to y=9.\n\nLet me set the turn index from now.\n\nAt turn T=60, y=1.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at turn T, say.\n\nEach action changes y.\n\nAfter k actions, I can be at y from 1-k to 1+k, but bounded.\n\nBut I need to go up.\n\nTo minimize time, I should go up as much as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nNow, collision times: at t=62 and t=63.\n\nt=62: avoid y=7\n\nt=63: avoid y=7 and y=8\n\nNow, from t=60, y=1.\n\nIf I go up every turn:\n\nt=60: y=1, safe (freeway 1, but at t=60, car not at 0)\n\na60=U, t=61 y=2\n\nt=61: y=2, freeway 2, at t=61, car: Δt=3, τ + s Δt = -35 + 36=1, h + s Δt = -24+36=12, span [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\na61=U, t=62 y=3\n\nt=62: y=3, freeway 3, at t=62, Δt=4, τ + s Δt = -35 + 48=13? s=12, Δt=62-58=4, τ + s Δt = -35 + 12*4 = -35+48=13, h + s Δt = -24 + 48=24, span [13,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nBut at t=62, I need to avoid y=7, but y=3 is fine.\n\nNow a62=U, t=63 y=4\n\nt=63: y=4, freeway 4, at t=63, Δt=5, τ + s Δt = -35 + 60=25, h + s Δt = -24+60=36, span [25,36], 0 not in, safe.\n\nBut at t=63, I need to avoid y=7 and y=8, not y=4.\n\nNow a63=U, t=64 y=5\n\nt=64: y=5, freeway 5, at t=64, Δt=6, τ + s Δt = -35 + 72=37, h + s Δt = -24+72=48, span [37,48], 0 not in, safe.\n\na64=U, t=65 y=6\n\nt=65: y=6, freeway 6.\n\nCars on y=6: first car (-24,-35,right,12) at t=65, Δt=7, span [ -35 + 84, -24 + 84] = [49,60], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car (48,37,right,12) at t=65, Δt=7, τ + s Δt =37+84=121, h + s Δt=48+84=132, span [121,132], 0 not in. Safe.\n\na65=U, t=66 y=7\n\nt=66: y=7, freeway 7.\n\nNow freeway 7 has cars that cause collision at t=62 and t=63, but now t=66.\n\nAt t=66, Δt=8, first car: τ + s Δt = -35 + 6*8 = -35 + 48 =13, h + s Δt = -24 + 48=24, span [13,24], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: τ + s Δt =13 + 48=61, h + s Δt=24+48=72, span [61,72], 0 not in. Safe.\n\na66=U, t=67 y=8\n\nt=67: y=8, freeway 8, similar, at Δt=9, first car: τ + s Δt = -35 + 54=19, h + s Δt = -24 + 54=30, span [19,30], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: τ + s Δt =13 + 54=67, h + s Δt=24+54=78, span [67,78], 0 not in. Safe.\n\na67=U, t=68 y=9, goal.\n\nBut this took many turns: from t=60 to t=67, 7 actions to go from y=1 to y=9, arriving t=68.\n\nBut earlier from start, I used two actions to go down to y=1 at t=60.\n\nSo total actions: from t=58 to t=67 for actions? Actions at t=58 to t=67, 10 actions, arrive at t=68.\n\nBut min was 6, this is 10, too long.\n\nI can go faster.\n\nSince at t=60 I am at y=1, I can go up faster to avoid later issues.\n\nBut the collisions at t=62 and t=63 are only for y=7 and y=8 at those times, not later.\n\nIn the above, I was slow, but I can be at higher y earlier.\n\nFor example, from t=60 y=1, I can go up multiple times.\n\nBut I need to be careful at t=62 and t=63.\n\nSpecifically, at t=62, I should not be on y=7.\n\nAt t=63, not on y=7 or y=8.\n\nNow, from t=60, y=1.\n\nIf I go up every turn:\n\nt=60: y=1\n\na60=U, t=61 y=2\n\na61=U, t=62 y=3\n\nAt t=62, y=3, not 7, so safe.\n\na62=U, t=63 y=4\n\nAt t=63, y=4, not 7 or 8, safe.\n\na63=U, t=64 y=5\n\na64=U, t=65 y=6\n\na65=U, t=66 y=7\n\nNow t=66 y=7, as before, at t=66, freeway 7 safe, since car not at 0.\n\na66=U, t=67 y=8\n\nt=67 y=8, freeway 8, at t=67, Δt=9, as above, safe.\n\na67=U, t=68 y=9.\n\nSame as before, 7 actions from t=60, arrive t=68.\n\nBut from y=1 to y=9, min 8 steps? y=1 to y=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9: 8 steps, so from t=60 to t=67 for actions, arrive t=68.\n\nt=60 position, after a60 at t=60, y at t=61.\n\nTo reach y=9, need y=9 at turn T.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=60, after k actions, y at t=60 + k.\n\nTo have y=9, need at least 8 up actions, so min k=8, arrive at t=68.\n\nIf I do some down, it takes more turns.\n\nSo from t=60, min arrive t=68.\n\nThen total from start: at t=58, after a58 and a59, at t=60 y=1.\n\nThen actions a60 to a67, 8 actions, arrive t=68.\n\nTotal actions from t=58 to t=67, 10 actions? t=58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67: 10 actions for H=10.\n\nBut earlier I thought min H=6, but with obstacles, it takes more.\n\nPerhaps I can reach faster by not going down to y=1.\n\nBut earlier, at t=60, I must be at y=0,1,7,8 to be safe.\n\ny=0 or1 possible from start, y=7 or8 not possible in two steps from y=3.\n\ny=0: if I go down to y=0.\n\ny=0 is safe, no cars.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nBut similar to y=1.\n\ny=0 at t=60.\n\nThen to y=9, need 9 steps, arrive at t=69, even later.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo y=1 is better.\n\nBut H=10 seems large.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=7 or8 at t=60, but from y=3 at t=58, in two steps, I can only reach y=1 to5, not 7 or8.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nThus, must be at y=1 or0 at t=60.\n\nThen min arrive at t=68 for y=9.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can avoid the t=62 and t=63 collisions faster.\n\nFrom t=60 y=1, if I go up faster, but I can only move one per turn, so I cannot reach high y faster than 8 turns.\n\nUnless I start from higher y, but I am at low y.\n\nAnother idea: at t=60, I am at y=1, but I can stay or go down to waste time, but that would make it slower.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=1 for a while, but then I reach y=9 later.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo min is to go up directly from y=1.\n\nBut in the path, at t=62 and t=63, as long as I am not on y=7 or8, it should be fine.\n\nIn the sequence above, from t=60 y=1, U to t=61 y=2, U to t=62 y=3 (safe), U to t=63 y=4 (safe), then U to t=64 y=5, U to t=65 y=6, U to t=66 y=7, U to t=67 y=8, U to t=68 y=9.\n\nAt t=66 y=7 and t=67 y=8, both are after t=63, so no collision issue, as cars have moved away.\n\nt=66 is later, safe.\n\nBut total turns: from start, actions at t=58 to t=67 for 10 actions? Let's list:\n\nTurn 58: action a58, after that y at t=59\n\nIn terms of turns and positions.\n\nTurn 58: position y=3, take action a58\n\nIf a58=D, then at turn 59, y=2\n\nThen at turn 59, take action a59, if a59=D, then at turn 60, y=1\n\nThen at turn 60, take action a60=U, at turn 61, y=2\n\nTurn 61: a61=U, turn 62, y=3\n\nTurn 62: a62=U, turn 63, y=4\n\nTurn 63: a63=U, turn 64, y=5\n\nTurn 64: a64=U, turn 65, y=6\n\nTurn 65: a65=U, turn 66, y=7\n\nTurn 66: a66=U, turn 67, y=8\n\nTurn 67: a67=U, turn 68, y=9\n\nNow, at turn 68, y=9, goal.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=58 to t=67, that's 10 actions (58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67).\n\nH=10.\n\nBut is this minimal?\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier by being at y=8 at t=60, but impossible from y=3 in two steps.\n\nAnother thought: at t=63, I need to avoid y=7 and y=8, but if I can be at y=9 at t=63, but from y=3 at t=58, in 5 actions, I can reach y=3+5=8 if all up, or y=9 if I start from higher, but min to y=9 from y=3 is 6 actions, arrive at t=64.\n\nBut at t=63, if I am at y=8, which is bad if at t=63.\n\nIn the direct path, I had issue at t=63 y=8 collision.\n\nBut if I can be at y=9 at t=63.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=58, after 5 actions, at turn 63, y can be from 3-5= -2 not possible, min y=0, max y=8.\n\nSo at t=63, y<=8, cannot be 9.\n\nEarliest at t=64 y=9.\n\nAt t=63, I can be at y=8, but at t=63, y=8 has collision, so I cannot be at y=8 at t=63.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at t=63 collision.\n\nSo to reach y=9 at t=64, I need to be at y=8 at t=63, but at t=63, y=8 collision, so I cannot be on y=8 at t=63.\n\nTherefore, I cannot arrive at t=64, because to be at y=9 at t=64, I must be at y=8 at t=63, but y=8 at t=63 has collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I try to arrive later.\n\nBut in the previous path, I arrive at t=68, after avoiding.\n\nBut let's see if I can arrive earlier than t=68.\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=7 at t=62, but at t=62, y=7 collision, so I cannot be at y=7 at t=62.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be at y=7 or y=8 at t=63.\n\nSo the earliest I can be at high y is after t=63.\n\nFor example, at t=64, I can be at y=7 or 8, but from where.\n\nLet's think the position at t=63.\n\nAt t=63, I need to be at a safe y, not 7 or 8.\n\nSafe y at t=63: y=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,9 but y=9 not possible, so y=0 to6.\n\nThen from there go to y=9.\n\nSimilarly at t=62, avoid y=7, so can be y=0-6 or 8,9 but 9 not, so 0-6 or8.\n\nBut y=8 at t=62: is it safe?\n\nAt t=62, avoid y=7 only, y=8 is ok at t=62.\n\nFreeway 8 at t=62: cars, first car (-24,-35,right,6), Δt=4, τ + s Δt = -35 + 24 = -11, h + s Δt = -24 + 24 =0, span [-11,0], 0 in, collision.\n\nOh, at t=62, freeway 8 also collision, because same car as freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 8 has the same cars, so at t=62, y=8 has collision.\n\nSimilarly at t=63, y=8 collision.\n\nSo at t=62, avoid y=7 and y=8.\n\nSimilarly at t=63, avoid y=7 and y=8.\n\nAt t=62, both y=7 and y=8 have collision.\n\nAt t=63, both have collision.\n\nSo at t=62, safe y are y=0,1,2,3,4,5,6\n\nSimilarly at t=63, safe y=0,1,2,3,4,5,6\n\nNow back to the path.\n\nI am at t=60, y=1.\n\nI need to be at safe y at t=62 and t=63.\n\nFor example, at t=62, I need y <=6 or y=0, but y=0 not freeway, safe.\n\nSimilarly t=63.\n\nSince I am at y=1 at t=60, I can go up to y=6 by t=62 or something.\n\nFrom t=60 y=1:\n\nIf I go up twice: a60=U, t=61 y=2; a61=U, t=62 y=3\n\nThen at t=62, y=3 <=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=62, I take action.\n\nIf a62=U, t=63 y=4, which is <=6, safe at t=63.\n\nThen from y=4 at t=63, I need to go to y=9.\n\nMin from here: to y=9, need 5 up, arrive at t=68.\n\na63=U, t=64 y=5; a64=U, t=65 y=6; a65=U, t=66 y=7; a66=U, t=67 y=8; a67=U, t=68 y=9.\n\nSame as before.\n\nFrom t=63 y=4, I can go faster? No, min 5 actions to y=9.\n\nBut at t=66 y=7 and t=67 y=8 are safe, as cars moved away.\n\nTo save time, from t=60 y=1, instead of going to y=3 at t=62, I can go higher.\n\nFor example, a60=U, t=61 y=2\n\nThen a61=U, t=62 y=3\n\nSame as above.\n\nIf I go up three times from t=60, but I can only do one per turn.\n\na60=U, t=61 y=2; a61=U, t=62 y=3; that's only y=3.\n\nCannot reach higher than y=3 at t=62 from y=1 at t=60.\n\ny=1 to y=3 in two steps: a60=U, a61=U, t=62 y=3.\n\nOr if I go up and then up, same.\n\nSo y=3 at t=62.\n\nThen to y=4 at t=63.\n\nThen to y=9 at t=68.\n\nPerhaps I can be at higher y at t=63.\n\nFrom t=62 y=3, if I go up, to y=4 at t=63.\n\nBut at t=63, I can be up to y=6 if I go fast, but from y=3 at t=62, to t=63, I can go to y=2,3,4.\n\nSo at t=63, y<=4 from here.\n\nNot higher.\n\nSo min arrive at t=68.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach y=9 at t=67 or something.\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=8 at t=66 or earlier.\n\nBut at t=63, I need to be at y<=6.\n\nSuppose at t=63, I am at y=6.\n\nThen from there, to y=9, min 3 actions: a63=U, t=64 y=7; a64=U, t=65 y=8; a65=U, t=66 y=9.\n\nArrive at t=66.\n\nBut at t=64 y=7, t=65 y=8, both after t=63, so safe, as long as no collision at those turns.\n\nNow, can I be at y=6 at t=63?\n\nFrom start, I am at t=60 y=1.\n\nt=60 to t=63 is 3 turns.\n\nFrom y=1, in 3 actions, I can reach y=1 to 4, max y=4 if all up: a60=U, t=61 y=2; a61=U, t=62 y=3; a62=U, t=63 y=4.\n\ny=4 at t=63.\n\nTo reach y=6 at t=63, I need to be at higher y earlier.\n\nBut at t=60, I am at y=1, so I cannot be at y=6 at t=63.\n\nMin y at t=63 from t=60 is y=1-3= -2 not, so y=0, max y=1+3=4.\n\nSo y<=4 at t=63.\n\nThus, earliest I can be at y=9 is t=68 from the path.\n\nPerhaps I can go down less at the beginning.\n\nAnother idea: instead of going down to y=1 at t=60, I could go to y=7 or 8 at t=60, but impossible.\n\nOr, I could wait at some y to pass the danger time.\n\nFor example, at t=58, instead of going down, I stay or go up, but then at t=60 I am in danger zone.\n\nUnless I can be at y=7 or 8 at t=60, but cannot.\n\nPerhaps from t=58, I go up to y=6 or something, but at t=60, y=6 has collision, as we saw.\n\ny=6 at t=60 collision.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, the only safe way at t=60 is to be at y=1 (or 0), then go up, arriving at t=68.\n\nBut let's confirm the number of turns.\n\nStart: turn t=58, position y=3.\n\nAction a58 = D (down), to y=2 at turn 59.\n\nAction a59 = D (down), to y=1 at turn 60.\n\nAction a60 = U (up), to y=2 at turn 61.\n\nAction a61 = U (up), to y=3 at turn 62.\n\nAction a62 = U (up), to y=4 at turn 63.\n\nAction a63 = U (up), to y=5 at turn 64.\n\nAction a64 = U (up), to y=6 at turn 65.\n\nAction a65 = U (up), to y=7 at turn 66.\n\nAction a66 = U (up), to y=8 at turn 67.\n\nAction a67 = U (up), to y=9 at turn 68.\n\nH = 10 actions, from t=58 to t=67.\n\nBut is there a shorter way?\n\nPerhaps I can save one turn by not going down twice but once, but if I go down once, to y=2 at t=59, then at t=59 I need to take action, but at t=60, if I am at y=2, collision, or if I go to y=1, but from y=2 at t=59, I can go to y=1 at t=60 with a59=D.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nIf at t=59 y=2, I go up to y=3 at t=60, collision.\n\nOr stay, y=2 at t=60, collision.\n\nSo must go down to y=1 at t=60.\n\nNo shorter.\n\nAnother idea: at t=63, since I need to avoid y=7 and y=8, but if I can be at y=6 at t=63, then I can go up to y=9 in three turns.\n\nBut to be at y=6 at t=63, from start.\n\nAt t=58 y=3.\n\nIn 5 turns to t=63? Turns: from t=58 to t=63, 5 turns later, position at t=63.\n\nAfter 5 actions, y at t=63 can be from 3-5= -2 to 3+5=8.\n\nSo can be y=6.\n\nFor example, all up: a58=U, t=59 y=4; a59=U, t=60 y=5; but at t=60 y=5 collision, not safe.\n\na58=U, t=59 y=4; then at t=59, if I go down, a59=D, t=60 y=3, collision at t=60.\n\nOr stay, y=4 at t=60 collision.\n\nOr up, y=5 collision.\n\nSo cannot be on y=4 or5 at t=59 without leading to t=60 collision.\n\nIf at t=59 I am at y=1 or something, but from t=58, if I go down to y=2 at t=59, then a59=D to y=1 at t=60, as before.\n\nThen from y=1 at t=60, to be at y=6 at t=63, I need to go up 5 times in 3 actions? From t=60 to t=63, 3 actions.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=60, after 3 actions, at t=63 y can be 1-3= -2 to 1+3=4, so y<=4 at t=63, cannot be y=6.\n\nThus impossible to be at y=6 at t=63.\n\nSimilarly, min at t=63 is y=4 from the path.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 10.\n\nBut let's see if I can arrive at t=67.\n\nTo arrive at t=67, y=9, I need to be at y=8 at t=66.\n\nAt t=66, y=8, is it safe? Freeway 8 at t=66, Δt=8, as before, span [19,30], 0 not in, safe.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at t=66, I need to be at y=7 or8 or9 at t=65, but y=9 not, so y=7 or8.\n\nAt t=65, if y=7, freeway 7 at t=65, Δt=7, first car: τ + s Δt = -35 + 42=7, h + s Δt = -24 + 42=18, span [7,18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8 at t=65 safe.\n\nThen to be at y=8 at t=66, for example, from t=65 y=7, U to t=66 y=8.\n\nBut I need to reach t=65 with y=7.\n\nFrom start, at t=58 y=3, to t=65, 7 turns later.\n\nMin to y=7 from y=3 is 4 up, arrive t=62, but at t=62, y=7 collision, not possible.\n\nIf arrive later, say at t=65.\n\nBut to be at y=7 at t=65, I need to have been at y=6 or7 or8 at t=64.\n\nBut let's not digress.\n\nFrom the beginning, with the down-down-up-up... path, it works with H=10.\n\nPerhaps I can go up to y=6 before t=60, but at t=60, y=6 collision, so I must not be on y=6 at t=60.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think H=10 is the minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 6.\n\nIn the path, when I go to y=6 at t=65, it is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo for the answer, I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the sequence, at some points I am on freeway, but no collision.\n\nFor example, at turn 66, y=7, freeway 7, but at t=66, Δt=8, car span [13,24], not at 0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn 58: D\n\nTurn 59: D\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: U\n\nTurn 62: U\n\nTurn 63: U\n\nTurn 64: U\n\nTurn 65: U\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: U\n\nIn this, after a67 U, at turn 68 y=9.\n\nH=10 actions.\n\nBut the player position at each turn:\n\nt=58: y=3\n\na58=D, t=59 y=2\n\na59=D, t=60 y=1\n\na60=U, t=61 y=2\n\na61=U, t=62 y=3\n\na62=U, t=63 y=4\n\na63=U, t=64 y=5\n\na64=U, t=65 y=6\n\na65=U, t=66 y=7\n\na66=U, t=67 y=8\n\na67=U, t=68 y=9\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nt=58: y=3, freeway 3, car span at t=58: [-35,-24], 0 not in, safe\n\nt=59: y=2, freeway 2, at t=59, Δt=1, span [-35+12, -24+12] = [-23,-12], 0 not in, safe\n\nt=60: y=1, freeway 1, at t=60, Δt=2, car: τ + s Δt = -47 + 6 = -41? s=3 for freeway 1, Δt=2, τ + s Δt = -47 + 3*2 = -47+6= -41, h + s Δt = -36 + 6 = -30, span [-41,-30], 0 not in, safe\n\nt=61: y=2, freeway 2, at t=61, Δt=3, span [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], 0 not in, safe\n\nt=62: y=3, freeway 3, at t=62, Δt=4, span [-35+48, -24+48] = [13,24], 0 not in, safe\n\nt=63: y=4, freeway 4, at t=63, Δt=5, span [-35+60, -24+60] = [25,36], 0 not in, safe\n\nt=64: y=5, freeway 5, at t=64, Δt=6, span [-35+72, -24+72] = [37,48], 0 not in, safe\n\nt=65: y=6, freeway 6, first car at t=65, Δt=7, span [-35+84, -24+84] = [49,60], 0 not in; second car span [37+84,48+84]=[121,132], 0 not in; safe\n\nt=66: y=7, freeway 7, first car at t=66, Δt=8, τ + s Δt = -35 + 6*8 = -35+48=13, h + s Δt = -24+48=24, span [13,24], 0 not in; second car τ=13, h=24, s=6, τ + s Δt =13+48=61, h + s Δt=24+48=72, span [61,72], 0 not in; safe\n\nt=67: y=8, freeway 8, similar, first car τ + s Δt = -35 + 6*9 = -35+54=19, h + s Δt = -24+54=30, span [19,30]; second car τ=13+54=67, h=24+54=78, span [67,78]; 0 not in, safe\n\nt=68: y=9, goal.\n\nAll safe.\n\nNow, is there a way with H=9?\n\nH=9 actions, from t=58 to t=66, arrive at t=67 y=9.\n\nTo arrive at t=67, need y=8 at t=66 with a66=U.\n\nBut at t=66, y=8 is safe, as above.\n\nNow, need to be at y=8 at t=66.\n\nFrom start, with 8 actions from t=58 to t=65? Actions from t=58 to t=65, 8 actions, position at t=66.\n\nAfter 8 actions, y at t=66.\n\nStart y=3, after 8 actions, y between 3-8= -5 to 3+8=11, but bounded, so y from 0 to 9.\n\nTo have y=8 at t=66.\n\nBut at t=60, I need to be at safe y, like y=1.\n\nSimilarly, at t=62 and t=63, safe y.\n\nSuppose at t=60 I am at y=1, as before.\n\nThen from t=60 to t=66, 6 turns.\n\nFrom y=1 to y=8, need 7 steps, but in 6 actions, I can reach y=1+6=7 at t=66.\n\nThen a66=U to y=8 at t=67, but I need y=9 at t=67? To have y=9 at t=67, need y=8 at t=66 with a66=U.\n\nBut if at t=66 y=7, then a66=U, t=67 y=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y=9 at t=67, I need to be at y=8 at t=66 and take U.\n\nBut with y=1 at t=60, in 6 actions, to t=66, I can be at y=7, as above.\n\nThen y=7 at t=66, then a66=U to y=8 at t=67, not y=9.\n\nIf I can be at y=8 at t=66 from y=1 at t=60, but in 6 actions, max y=1+6=7, since each action up increases by 1.\n\nSo y=7 at t=66, then I need one more action to y=8 at t=67, but not to y=9.\n\nTo reach y=9, I need to be at y=8 at some turn and take U.\n\nEarliest I can be at y=8 is, for example, if at t=63 I am at y=6, then a63=U, t=64 y=7; a64=U, t=65 y=8; a65=U, t=66 y=9? a65=U to y=9 at t=66? No.\n\nAt t=65, position, after a65, y at t=66.\n\nIf at t=65 y=8, then a65=U, t=66 y=9.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at t=65.\n\nNow, from start.\n\nAt t=58 y=3.\n\nWith 7 actions to t=64? Actions from t=58 to t=64, 7 actions, position at t=65.\n\nAfter 7 actions, y at t=65 can be y=3 to 10, but max 9.\n\nTo be at y=8 at t=65.\n\nBut at t=60, I must be at safe y, like y=1.\n\nThen from y=1 at t=60, to t=65, 5 actions.\n\nMax y=1+5=6 at t=65.\n\nCannot be y=8.\n\nIf I go directly up from start, but at t=60 I cannot be on y=3,4,5,6.\n\nSuppose I stay at y=3 for some turns, but at t=60, if on y=3, collision.\n\nSo I must leave before or go down.\n\nI think it's impossible to arrive before t=68.\n\nThus minimal H is 10.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be actions for turn t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nt1=58, H=10, so turns 58 to 67.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 58: D\n\nTurn 59: D\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: U\n\nTurn 62: U\n\nTurn 63: U\n\nTurn 64: U\n\nTurn 65: U\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: U\n\nIn the sequence, after a67 U, at t=68 y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nI could have gone to y=0 at t=60, but that might take longer to go up.\n\nFor example, a58=D, a59=D, to y=2? a58=D, t=59 y=2; a59=D, t=60 y=1, same as before.\n\nIf a58=S, but then at t=59 y=3, then must go down to avoid t=60, a59=D, t=60 y=2, but y=2 at t=60 collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nThus the answer.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 58\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 10. The sequence of actions moves the player down to avoid the collision at turn 60 on freeways \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\), then proceeds upward, avoiding collisions at turns 62 and 63 on freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n- At turn 58, move down (D) to position (0, 2) at turn 59.\n- At turn 59, move down (D) to position (0, 1) at turn 60, avoiding the collision at turn 60 on higher freeways.\n- From turn 60 to turn 67, move up (U) each turn to incrementally reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 68.\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions:\n- At turn 60, \\(y = 1\\) is safe (freeway 1 car span does not include 0).\n- Turns 61 to 67 are safe as the player is not on freeways \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) during turns 62 and 63, and car positions do not cause collisions at other times.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 58: \\text{D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 59: \\text{D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 60: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 61: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 62: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 63: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 64: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 65: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 66: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 67: \\text{U} }",

The cars are moving, and I have to make sure that when I'm on a particular row at a particular turn, there's no car on that row whose span includes x=0 at that turn.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car movements. The spans are given at turn t1=60, and for future turns T, the span changes based on the direction and speed.\n\nFor left-moving cars, which I think are moving to the left, so decreasing x, but the notation says:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] but it says head h and tail τ, and for left-moving, it might be that h < τ or something? I need to be careful.\n\nLooking back: for left-moving, it says \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\"\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIn the right-moving case, it says Span(t1) = [τ, h] which might imply τ ≤ h, so the tail is at τ and head at h, with τ ≤ h for right-moving? But in the car state, for example, freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3). If it's right-moving, and Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? But -59 < -48, so [τ, h] with τ = -59, h = -48, so the car is from x=-59 to x=-48, and since it's right-moving, at time T, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-59 + 3(T-60), -48 + 3(T-60)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but in the table, all cars seem to be right-moving? Let's check.\n\nFreeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3) — direction right.\n\nFreeway 2: (48, 37, right, 12) — 48 and 37, but 37<48, so if Span(t1) = [τ, h] for right-moving, it should be [tail, head], so tail at 37, head at 48? But 37 to 48 is increasing x, so right-moving makes sense.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3,4,5 same as 2: (48,37,right,12) — probably typo, should be (37,48) or something, but it's written as head h and tail τ, but in the direction, it specifies.\n\nIn the car state, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor freeway 2: head h=48, tail τ=37, direction right, speed 12.\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [37,48]? But [37,48] with τ=37, h=48.\n\nThen at time T, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [37 + 12(T-60), 48 + 12(T-60)]\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 1: head h=-48, tail τ=-59, direction right, speed 3.\n\nSince right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nThen Span(T) = [-59 + 3(T-60), -48 + 3(T-60)]\n\nNow freeway 6: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst car: head 48, tail 37, right, speed 12 → Span(t1) = [37,48] for t1=60\n\nSecond car: head 0, tail -11, right, speed 12 → Span(t1) = [-11,0]\n\nFreeway 7: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nFirst car: head -48, tail -59, right, speed 6 → Span(t1) = [-59,-48]\n\nSecond car: head 0, tail -11, right, speed 6 → Span(t1) = [-11,0]\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7, (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nAlso freeway 3,4,5 same as 2: (48,37,right,12) each, so probably one car per freeway except 6,7,8 have two cars.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4,5 each have one car: (48,37,right,12) meaning head 48, tail 37, so [37,48] at t1.\n\nBut for collision, we care about when the span includes x=0 at the turn we are on that freeway.\n\nThe player starts at (0,0) at turn 60. y=0 is not a freeway, so no cars there. Freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nI need to go to y=9, which is also not a freeway, so no cars there. So I only need to worry about rows y=1 to y=8 when I'm on them.\n\nNow, the player moves at each turn: action U, D, or S, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y clamped to [0,9].\n\nStarting from y=0, to reach y=9, I need to increase y by 9, so at least 9 turns if I go up every time, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, but since I want minimal turns, I should go up as much as possible, only deviating if necessary.\n\nBut with cars, I might have to wait or something.\n\nAlso, when I move, at turn T, if I am on y_T, and there is a car on that freeway with 0 in its span at turn T, I collide.\n\nImportantly, when I move from y to y+1, at turn T, I am on y, so I collide if car on y has 0 in span at T. When I arrive at y+1 at turn T+1, I am on y+1 at turn T+1, so I care about car on y+1 at turn T+1.\n\nThe note says: if at turn T I move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, then at turn T I am on y_T, so I am not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so I don't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T, only at turn T+1 when I arrive.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay on the same row, I am on that row at each turn.\n\nNow, to minimize H, the number of turns from t1=60, so I want to reach (0,9) as soon as possible.\n\nSince I start at y=0 and need to be at y=9, the minimal possible H is 9, if I go up every turn without collision.\n\nBut I need to check if that's possible given the cars.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway, when x=0 is occupied by a car, meaning 0 is in the span at that turn.\n\nFor each row k, and for each car on that row, find when 0 is in Span(T) for that car.\n\nThen, for row k, at turn T, it is occupied if any car on that row has 0 in span at T.\n\nSince multiple cars per row possible.\n\nThen, when I am on row k at turn T, it must not be occupied at T.\n\nNow, let's compute for each row the times when it is occupied.\n\nStart with freeway 1: y=1\n\nCars: one car, (-48,-59,right,3) so at t1=60, span [τ, h] = [-59,-48]\n\nSpan(T) = [-59 + 3(T-60), -48 + 3(T-60)]\n\nSet 0 in [L, R] where L = -59 + 3(T-60), R = -48 + 3(T-60)\n\nSo 0 ≥ L and 0 ≤ R\n\n0 ≥ -59 + 3(T-60) and 0 ≤ -48 + 3(T-60)\n\nFirst inequality: 0 ≥ -59 + 3(T-60) => 59 ≥ 3(T-60) => T-60 ≤ 59/3 ≈ 19.666, so T ≤ 60 + 19 = 79? Let's calculate.\n\n3(T-60) ≤ 59 => T-60 ≤ 59/3 = 19 + 2/3, so T ≤ 79 + 2/3, since T integer, T ≤ 79\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 ≤ -48 + 3(T-60) => 48 ≤ 3(T-60) => T-60 ≥ 48/3 = 16, so T ≥ 76\n\nThus, 0 in span when T ≥ 76 and T ≤ 79\n\nT from 76 to 79 inclusive.\n\nT=76: L = -59 + 3(16) = -59 + 48 = -11, R = -48 + 48 = 0, so [ -11, 0], 0 is included.\n\nT=77: L = -59 + 3(17) = -59 + 51 = -8, R = -48 + 51 = 3, [ -8,3], 0 in\n\nT=78: L = -59 + 54 = -5, R = -48 + 54 = 6, [-5,6], 0 in\n\nT=79: L = -59 + 57 = -2, R = -48 + 57 = 9, [-2,9], 0 in\n\nT=80: L = -59 + 60 =1, R= -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nT=75: L= -59 + 3(15)= -59+45= -14, R= -48+45= -3, [-14,-3], 0 not in\n\nSo for freeway 1, occupied at T=76,77,78,79\n\nNow freeway 2: y=2, one car (48,37,right,12) head 48, tail 37, so span at t1: [τ,h] = [37,48]\n\nSpan(T) = [37 + 12(T-60), 48 + 12(T-60)]\n\n0 in [L,R] with L=37+12(T-60), R=48+12(T-60)\n\n0 ≥ L and 0 ≤ R\n\n0 ≥ 37 + 12(T-60) => 12(T-60) ≤ -37 => T-60 ≤ -37/12 ≈ -3.083, so T ≤ 60 - 4? Since T-60 integer, 12(T-60) ≤ -37, since 12* (-3) = -36 > -37? -36 > -37, so 12(T-60) ≤ -37 implies T-60 ≤ -4, because 12*(-3) = -36 > -37, so not ≤ -37, 12*(-4) = -48 ≤ -37.\n\nSimilarly, 0 ≤ R: 0 ≤ 48 + 12(T-60) => 12(T-60) ≥ -48 => T-60 ≥ -4\n\nNow, 0 ≥ L: 0 ≥ 37 + 12(T-60) => 12(T-60) ≤ -37\n\nSince 12(T-60) integer, 12(T-60) ≤ -37, so T-60 ≤ -4 because 12*(-3) = -36 > -37, -36 is greater than -37, so for inequality 12(delta) ≤ -37, since -36 > -37, it must be delta ≤ -4, so T-60 ≤ -4\n\nSimilarly, 0 ≤ R: 0 ≤ 48 + 12(T-60) => 12(T-60) ≥ -48 => T-60 ≥ -4\n\nNow, for 0 to be in [L,R], we need both 0 ≥ L and 0 ≤ R\n\n0 ≥ L: 12(T-60) ≤ -37\n\n0 ≤ R: 12(T-60) ≥ -48\n\nBut 12(T-60) ≥ -48 and ≤ -37? Not possible because -48 to -37, but let's see values.\n\nFor example, T-60 = -4: L = 37 +12*(-4) = 37 -48 = -11, R=48-48=0, so [ -11,0], 0 included? 0 ≤ R=0, yes, and 0 ≥ L=-11, yes.\n\n0 ≤ R=0 is true, since span includes endpoints I assume.\n\nSimilarly, T-60 = -3: L=37 +12*(-3)=37-36=1, R=48-36=12, [1,12], 0 not ≥1? 0 ≥ L=1? 0<1, false.\n\nT-60 = -5: L=37+12*(-5)=37-60= -23, R=48-60= -12, [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only when T-60 = -4, T=56\n\nBut T=56 is before t1=60, and we are at turn 60, so for T≥60, L and R are larger.\n\nT=60: L=37+0=37, R=48, [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nT=61: L=37+12=49, R=48+12=60, [49,60], no.\n\nFor T>60, L and R increase, so 0 never in span for T≥60.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 3,4,5: same as freeway 2, each has one car identical, so for y=3,4,5, no occupation at T≥60.\n\nNow freeway 6: y=6, two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12) same as above, span at T: [37+12(T-60), 48+12(T-60)], which for T≥60, min L=37 at T=60, increasing, so 0 not in, as above.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12) head 0, tail -11, direction right, speed 12.\n\nSpan(t1) = [τ, h] = [-11, 0] for t1=60\n\nSince right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-11 + 12(T-60), 0 + 12(T-60)] = [12(T-60) -11, 12(T-60)]\n\nNow, 0 in [L,R] where L=12(T-60)-11, R=12(T-60)\n\n0 ≥ L: 0 ≥ 12(delta) -11 where delta=T-60\n\n0 ≥ 12delta -11 => 12delta ≤ 11 => delta ≤ 11/12 <1, so delta ≤ 0\n\n0 ≤ R: 0 ≤ 12delta => delta ≥ 0\n\nThus delta=0, T=60\n\nAt T=60, L=12(0)-11=-11, R=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nFor other T, not.\n\nSo for second car, occupied only at T=60.\n\nBut at T=60, for freeway 6, first car not occupied, second car occupied at T=60.\n\nThus freeway 6 occupied at T=60.\n\nNow freeway 7: y=7, two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,6) head -48, tail -59, direction right, speed 6.\n\nSpan(t1) = [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nSpan(T) = [-59 + 6(T-60), -48 + 6(T-60)]\n\n0 in [L,R]: L = -59 +6delta, R= -48 +6delta, delta=T-60\n\n0 ≥ L: 0 ≥ -59 +6delta => 6delta ≤ 59 => delta ≤ 59/6 ≈ 9.833, so delta ≤ 9\n\n0 ≤ R: 0 ≤ -48 +6delta => 6delta ≥ 48 => delta ≥ 8\n\nThus for delta=8,9\n\nT=68,69\n\nT=68: L= -59 +6*8 = -59+48= -11, R= -48+48=0, [-11,0], 0 in\n\nT=69: L= -59+54= -5, R= -48+54=6, [-5,6], 0 in\n\nT=70: L= -59+60=1, R= -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSecond car on freeway 7: (0,-11,right,6) head 0, tail -11, direction right, speed 6.\n\nSpan(t1) = [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nSpan(T) = [-11 + 6(T-60), 0 + 6(T-60)] = [6delta -11, 6delta]\n\n0 in [L,R]: 0 ≥ L: 0 ≥ 6delta -11 => 6delta ≤ 11 => delta ≤ 11/6 ≈1.833, delta≤1\n\n0 ≤ R: 0 ≤ 6delta => delta ≥0\n\nThus delta=0 or 1\n\nT=60: L=6*0 -11=-11, R=0, [-11,0], 0 in\n\nT=61: L=6*1 -11=6-11=-5, R=6, [-5,6], 0 in\n\nT=62: L=12-11=1, R=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo for freeway 7, occupied when either car has 0 in span.\n\nFirst car at T=68,69\n\nSecond car at T=60,61\n\nSo overall, occupied at T=60,61 (from second car) and T=68,69 (from first car)\n\nNow freeway 8: y=8, same as freeway 7, two cars: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nSo identical to freeway 7, occupied at T=60,61 and T=68,69\n\nNow, back to freeway 1, we have occupied at T=76,77,78,79\n\nFreeway 2,3,4,5: no occupation at T≥60\n\nFreeway 6: occupied at T=60 only\n\nFreeway 7: occupied at T=60,61,68,69\n\nFreeway 8: occupied at T=60,61,68,69\n\nI need to go from y=0 at T=60 to y=9.\n\nAt turn T=60, I am at (0,0), which is safe.\n\nI need to move to higher y.\n\nThe minimal path is to go up each turn, so from T=60 to T=68, in 8 turns, I can be at y=8, but at T=68 I would be at y=8 if I go up each time.\n\nBut let's see the timeline.\n\nSet T=60: start at y=0\n\nAfter action at T, I move to new position at T+1.\n\nLet me denote the turn when I take action.\n\nAt the beginning of turn T, I am at position (0, y_T)\n\nI take action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}\n\nThen at turn T+1, I am at (0, y_{T+1})\n\nAnd I collide if at turn T+1, when I am on y_{T+1}, it is occupied at that turn.\n\nFor example, at T=60, I am at y=0, I take action a_60, which sets y_61.\n\nThen at turn T=61, I am at (0,y_61), and I need that freeway y_61 is not occupied at T=61.\n\nSimilarly, at each turn.\n\nI start at T=60 on y=0, which is safe.\n\nI take action to go to some y for T=61.\n\ny_61 can be 0 or 1, since from y=0, I can go U to y=1, D to y=0 (but y=0 min), or S to y=0.\n\nBut I need to go up, so probably U to y=1.\n\nBut at T=61, if I go to y=1, is it occupied?\n\nFreeway 1 is occupied only at T=76,77,78,79, which is later, so at T=61, freeway 1 is not occupied, since only at 76-79.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\nBut I need to consider when I arrive at each row.\n\nLet me list the occupation times for each row:\n\n- y=1: occupied at T=76,77,78,79\n\n- y=2: not occupied for T≥60\n\n- y=3: not occupied\n\n- y=4: not occupied\n\n- y=5: not occupied\n\n- y=6: occupied at T=60\n\n- y=7: occupied at T=60,61,68,69\n\n- y=8: occupied at T=60,61,68,69\n\ny=6 occupied only at T=60, so for T≠60, it is safe.\n\ny=7 occupied at T=60,61,68,69; so safe only when T not in {60,61,68,69}\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nNow, I need to be at y=9 at some turn, say T_end.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so always safe.\n\nThe player path: I start at T=60, y=0.\n\nI take actions from T=60 to T=60+H-1, and at turn (60+H-1), I am at y=9.\n\nAfter H actions, I have done H moves, so from T=60 to T=60+H-1, I take H actions, and at turn T=60+H-1, I am at position after the last action.\n\nAt turn T, after action, I am at y_{T} for that turn? Let's clarify the timing.\n\nAt the start of turn T, I am at position (0, y_T)\n\nI take action a_T, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + delta y\n\nThen, at the start of turn T+1, I am at (0, y_{T+1})\n\nAnd at that point, for collision, at turn T+1, on freeway y_{T+1}, if it is occupied at that turn T+1.\n\nThe collision is checked at the start of the turn when I am on the position.\n\nIn the game dynamics, it says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nSo at turn T, when I am on (0, y_T), if y_T between 1 and 8, and there is a car with 0 in span at T, then collision.\n\nFor the destination, at turn T when I am at y=9, no cars, so ok.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 at turn T, I need to have y_T =9.\n\nThe minimal H: since I start at y=0, after k up moves, I can be at y=k.\n\nTo be at y=9, I need at least 9 up moves, and possibly some S or D, but D would make me go down, which might increase H, so for minimal H, I should avoid D, and use S only if necessary to wait.\n\nSince the only obstacles are at certain times, I might need to delay going up to avoid being on a row when it is occupied.\n\nBut since I want minimal H, I should go up as fast as possible, and only if I would be on an occupied row, I need to do something else.\n\nStart at T=60, y=0.\n\nI take action a_60 to set y_61.\n\nIf I go U, y_61=1.\n\nThen at T=61, I am on y=1.\n\nIs y=1 occupied at T=61? From above, y=1 occupied only at T=76-79, so at T=61, not occupied, so safe.\n\nI could go S or D, but that would keep me at y=0 or go down, but y=0 is safe, but I need to go up, so better to go U.\n\nSo a_60 = U, then at T=61, y=1.\n\nNow at T=61, I am on y=1, safe.\n\nTake action a_61 to set y_62.\n\nI can go U to y=2, or S to y=1, or D to y=0.\n\ny=2 is not occupied at any time, so safe to go there.\n\nGo U: y_62=2.\n\nAt T=62, y=2, safe.\n\nSimilarly, go U to y=3 at T=63, safe.\n\nU to y=4 at T=64, safe.\n\nU to y=5 at T=65, safe.\n\nNow, from y=5, I need to go to y=6.\n\nBut y=6 is occupied only at T=60.\n\nAt T=65, when I am at y=5, I take action a_65 to set y_66.\n\nIf I go U, y_66=6.\n\nThen at T=66, I am on y=6.\n\nIs y=6 occupied at T=66? Occupation only at T=60, so at T=66, not occupied, so safe.\n\nI could go S or D, but no need.\n\nSo go U, at T=66, y=6, safe.\n\nNow from y=6, at T=66, take action a_66 to set y_67.\n\nI can go U to y=7, or S to y=6, etc.\n\nBut y=7 is occupied at T=68,69, and also at T=60,61.\n\nAt T=67? y=7 occupation: T=60,61,68,69.\n\nT=67 not in, so safe.\n\nIf I go U at T=66, then y_67=7.\n\nAt T=67, I am on y=7.\n\nT=67 not occupied time, so safe.\n\nThen at T=67, take action a_67 to set y_68.\n\nI can go U to y=8.\n\ny=8 occupied at T=68,69.\n\nIf I go U at T=67, then y_68=8.\n\nAt T=68, I am on y=8, which is occupied at T=68, since y=8 occupied at T=68,69.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt T=68, y=8 is occupied, so if I am there, collision.\n\nI could go S at T=67 to stay at y=7.\n\nAt T=67, I am at y=7, which is safe since T=67 not occupied.\n\nIf I go S, y_68=7.\n\nThen at T=68, I am on y=7.\n\nBut y=7 is occupied at T=68, since T=68 is one of the occupied times.\n\ny=7 occupied at T=68, so if I am on y=7 at T=68, collision.\n\nIf I go D at T=67 to y=6, but y=6 is safe at T=68? y=6 only occupied at T=60, so at T=68, safe.\n\nBut let's see the actions.\n\nAt T=67, I am at y=7, safe.\n\nI need to set y_68.\n\nOptions:\n\n- U: y_68=8, but at T=68, y=8 occupied, collision.\n\n- S: y_68=7, at T=68, y=7 occupied, collision.\n\n- D: y_68=6, then at T=68, y=6, which is not occupied (only at T=60), so safe.\n\nBut going down to y=6 at T=68.\n\nThen I need to go up again, which takes extra turns.\n\nFrom y=6 at T=68, I can go U to y=7 at T=69.\n\nBut at T=69, y=7 is occupied, so if I go to y=7 at T=69, collision.\n\ny=7 occupied at T=69.\n\nSo I need to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at T=68 and T=69.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nNow, back to T=67.\n\nAt T=67, I am at y=7, safe.\n\nI need to choose an action so that I don't end up on y=7 or y=8 at T=68 or T=69.\n\nSince at T=68 and T=69, both y=7 and y=8 are occupied.\n\nFor y=7: occupied T=60,61,68,69\n\ny=8: occupied T=60,61,68,69\n\nSo at T=68 and T=69, I cannot be on y=7 or y=8.\n\nAt T=67, if I go D to y=6, then at T=68, I am on y=6, safe.\n\nThen at T=68, I am on y=6, take action a_68.\n\nI cannot go U to y=7, because at T=69, I would be on y=7, which is occupied at T=69.\n\nIf I go S, stay at y=6, then at T=69, y=6, safe, but I need to go up eventually.\n\nIf I go D to y=5, but that might be worse.\n\nI could stay at y=6 until T=70, when y=7 is safe.\n\ny=7 is safe for T not in {60,61,68,69}, so at T=70, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 safe at T=70.\n\nNow, current turn: let's list the turns.\n\nI am at T=67, y=7.\n\nIf I go D at a_67, then y_68=6.\n\nAt T=68, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at T=68, I take action. If I go U, y_69=7, but at T=69, y=7 occupied, collision.\n\nIf I go S, y_69=6, then at T=69, y=6 safe.\n\nThen at T=69, I can go U to y=7? But at T=70, I would be on y=7.\n\nT=70, y=7 not occupied, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let's see the timing.\n\nI want to minimize H.\n\nIf I go directly up, I could be at y=8 at T=67? Let's see the sequence.\n\nStart T=60, y=0\n\na_60=U, y_61=1 at T=61\n\na_61=U, y_62=2 at T=62\n\na_62=U, y_63=3 at T=63\n\na_63=U, y_64=4 at T=64\n\na_64=U, y_65=5 at T=65\n\na_65=U, y_66=6 at T=66\n\na_66=U, y_67=7 at T=67\n\nNow at T=67, y=7, safe (since T=67 not occupied)\n\nNow I need to set y_68.\n\nIf I could go to y=8, but at T=68, y=8 occupied.\n\nGo to y=6 or other.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nAnother idea: from y=5, I could delay going to y=6, but y=6 is safe except T=60, which is past.\n\nAt T=65, I am at y=5, I can go U to y=6 at T=66, as before.\n\nBut then at y=6, T=66, I could stay there for one turn.\n\nAt T=66, y=6, safe.\n\nTake action a_66.\n\nIf I go S, then y_67=6, at T=67, y=6 safe.\n\nThen at T=67, I go U to y=7, y_68=7? At T=68, y=7 occupied.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf at T=66, I go U to y=7, y_67=7, at T=67, y=7 safe (T=67 not occupied).\n\nThen at T=67, as before, I need to go down or something.\n\nBut going down wastes time.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 are occupied at T=68 and T=69, I need to be not on them at those turns.\n\nI could be on y=9 at T=68 or something.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so safe.\n\nBut to be at y=9, I need to be at y=8 at previous turn and go up.\n\nAt turn T, if I am at y=8, and I go U, then at T+1, y=9.\n\nBut at T=68, if I am at y=8, it is occupied, so I cannot be there.\n\nSimilarly at T=69.\n\nSo I need to be at y=8 at a time when it is not occupied, and go up to y=9.\n\ny=8 not occupied when T not in {60,61,68,69}, so for example T=67, T=70, etc.\n\nSimilarly for y=7.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nAt T=67, I am at y=7, which is safe at T=67.\n\nIf I go U to y=8 at T=68, but T=68 occupied, not good.\n\nGo S to y=7 at T=68, occupied, not good.\n\nGo D to y=6 at T=68.\n\nAt T=68, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at T=68, I am on y=6.\n\nI can go U to y=7 at T=69, but T=69 y=7 occupied.\n\nGo S to y=6 at T=69, safe.\n\nThen at T=69, go U to y=7 at T=70.\n\nAt T=70, y=7, which is not occupied (since occupied only at 60,61,68,69), so T=70 safe.\n\nThen from y=7 at T=70, I can go U to y=8 at T=71.\n\nAt T=71, y=8, not occupied (occupied at 60,61,68,69, so T=71 safe), so ok.\n\nThen go U to y=9 at T=72.\n\nAt T=72, y=9, done.\n\nBut let's count the turns.\n\nStart from T=60, actions from T=60 to T=71? Let's list.\n\nT=60: start y=0, take a_60=U, to y_61=1\n\nT=61: y=1, take a_61=U, to y_62=2\n\nT=62: y=2, a_62=U, to y_63=3\n\nT=63: y=3, a_63=U, to y_64=4\n\nT=64: y=4, a_64=U, to y_65=5\n\nT=65: y=5, a_65=U, to y_66=6\n\nT=66: y=6, now here instead of going U immediately, I need to wait or something.\n\nIn this sequence, at T=66, y=6, I can take action.\n\nIf I go U, to y_67=7, at T=67 y=7 safe.\n\nThen at T=67, I go D to y_68=6, so at T=68 y=6 safe.\n\nThen at T=68, y=6, I go S to y_69=6? a_68=S, then y_69=6, at T=69 y=6 safe.\n\nThen at T=69, I go U to y_70=7, at T=70 y=7 safe.\n\nThen a_70=U to y_71=8, at T=71 y=8 safe.\n\nThen a_71=U to y_72=9, at T=72 y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns from t1=60, so from turn 60 to turn 72, that's 13 turns? Turns: 60 to 72 inclusive is 13 turns, but actions from t=0 to H-1, so H actions.\n\nDefine H: the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so actions at turn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAt turn t1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nIn this case, t1=60.\n\nAfter H actions, I am at turn 60 + H -1.\n\nFor example, after 0 actions, at turn 60, position (0,0)\n\nAfter 1 action, at turn 61, position y_61\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at turn 60 + k, position y_{60+k}\n\nSet y_{60+k} =9 for some k, then H = k+1? Let's see.\n\nStart: turn 60, before any action, position (0,y_60) = (0,0)\n\nAfter first action a_60, at turn 61, position y_61\n\nAfter second action a_61, at turn 62, position y_62\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 60 + H, position y_{60+H}\n\nWe want y_{60+H} =9.\n\nAnd the last action is at turn 60 + H -1.\n\nThe sequence is actions for turn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so turns 60 to 60+H-1.\n\nAt turn 60+H-1, I take the last action, which sets y_{60+H}\n\nThen at turn 60+H, I am at y_{60+H} =9.\n\nSo H is the number of actions.\n\nIn my sequence:\n\nI need to have y at some turn =9.\n\nIn the above, if I go directly, I can be at y=7 at T=67.\n\nThen if I go down to y=6 at T=68.\n\nThen at T=68, y=6.\n\nThen I stay or go up.\n\nBut to reach y=9, I need to go up from there.\n\nAt T=68, y=6, I can go S to stay at y=6 for T=69.\n\nAt T=69, y=6, I go U to y=7 at T=70.\n\nAt T=70, y=7, I go U to y=8 at T=71.\n\nAt T=71, y=8, I go U to y=9 at T=72.\n\nSo at turn 72, y=9.\n\nH: actions from turn 60 to turn 71? Turn of actions.\n\nActions: a_60 to a_71, that's 12 actions.\n\nt from 0 to 11, H=12.\n\nTurn 60: a_60\n\n...\n\nTurn 71: a_71\n\nAt turn 72, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut can I do better?\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=8 at T=67, but how?\n\nFrom start, to be at y=8 at T=67, that means after 7 up moves, at turn 67 y=8.\n\nT=60: start y=0\n\na_60=U, T=61 y=1\n\na_61=U, T=62 y=2\n\n...\n\na_66=U, T=67 y=7? Let's count.\n\nAfter 0 actions: T=60 y=0\n\nAfter 1 action: T=61 y=1\n\nAfter 2: T=62 y=2\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions: T=60+k y=k, if all U.\n\nTo be at y=8 at T=67, so after 8 actions, T=68 y=8.\n\nT=60+k with y=k, so at T=68, y=8.\n\nBut T=68, y=8 is occupied, so I cannot be there at T=68.\n\nSimilarly, at T=67, I can be at y=7 with 7 actions: at T=67, y=7 after a_66=U.\n\nBut y=7 at T=67 is safe, as above.\n\nNow, if at T=67, y=7, I could go directly to y=9? No, I need to go to y=8 first.\n\nUnless I go up twice, but each action is one step.\n\nEach move changes y by at most 1.\n\nSo from y=7, I need to go to y=8 then to y=9.\n\nBut at T=68, if I go to y=8, occupied.\n\nI need to go to y=8 at a safe time, like T=70.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at T=70, I need to have actions leading there.\n\nSince the blockage is only at T=68 and T=69 for y=7 and y=8, I can be at lower rows during that time.\n\nBut I am at y=6 at T=66.\n\nAt T=66, y=6.\n\nInstead of going to y=7 at T=67, I can stay at y=6 for one more turn.\n\nSo at T=66, y=6, take a_66=S, then y_67=6, at T=67 y=6 safe.\n\nThen at T=67, y=6, take a_67=U, to y_68=7.\n\nBut at T=68, y=7 occupied! Collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf at T=67, I go U to y_68=7, but T=68 occupied.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo I need to be not on y=7 or y=8 at T=68 and T=69.\n\nSo during T=68 and T=69, I should be on y<=6 or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 I can only be if I come from y=8.\n\nSo possible to be on y=6 or lower.\n\nFor example, at T=67, if I am at y=6, safe.\n\nThen at T=67, take action.\n\nIf I go U to y=7, but at T=68 y=7 occupied.\n\nGo S to y=6, then at T=68 y=6 safe.\n\nThen at T=68, take action.\n\nIf I go U to y=7, at T=69 y=7 occupied.\n\nGo S to y=6, at T=69 y=6 safe.\n\nThen at T=69, go U to y=7 at T=70, safe.\n\nThen U to y=8 at T=71, safe.\n\nU to y=9 at T=72.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut from T=67, if I go D to y=5 or something, but that might take longer.\n\nFor example, at T=67, go D to y=6? From y=7, go D to y=6 at T=68.\n\nThen at T=68 y=6, same as before.\n\nNot better.\n\nCan I reach y=9 before T=68?\n\nFor example, at T=67, if I could be at y=9, but impossible, since from y=0 to y=9 min 9 moves.\n\nAt T=69, y=9: need 9 actions, from T=60 to T=68? After 9 actions, T=69 y=9.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at T=69, I need to be at y=8 at T=68 and go U.\n\nBut at T=68, y=8 is occupied, so I cannot be on y=8 at T=68 to go up.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=9 from y=8 at T=67, but at T=67, if I am at y=8, is it safe?\n\ny=8 occupied at T=60,61,68,69.\n\nT=67 not occupied, so at T=67, y=8 is safe.\n\nThen from y=8 at T=67, I can go U to y=9 at T=68.\n\nAt T=68, I am at y=9, which is safe, no cars.\n\nBut at T=68, when I go to y=9, I am not on the freeway during the move, but at turn T=68, I am at y=9, so no issue.\n\nThe collision is only if at the turn, I am on the freeway row with car at x=0.\n\nAt T=68, if I am at y=9, not a freeway, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo, to be at y=8 at T=67, then go U at T=67 to y=9 at T=68.\n\nNow, can I be at y=8 at T=67?\n\nAt T=67, y=8.\n\nFrom start: with all U, at T=67, after 7 actions, y=7, not y=8.\n\nTo be at y=8 at T=67, that requires after 8 actions, at T=68 y=8.\n\nBut T=67 is before.\n\nTurn: at turn T, position y_T.\n\nAt turn 60, y_60=0\n\nAfter a_60, y_61\n\n...\n\nAfter a_66, y_67\n\nTo have y_67=8, that means from y_60=0 to y_67=8 in 7 actions? Actions from T=60 to T=66, that's 7 actions (t=0 to 6).\n\nEach action can increase y by at most 1, so from y=0 to y=8, min 8 actions.\n\nWith 7 actions, max y=7.\n\nSo at turn 67, after 7 actions, y <=7.\n\nThus, impossible to be at y=8 at T=67.\n\nSimilarly, earliest to be at y=8 is at T=68 with 8 up moves, but T=68 occupied.\n\nOr at T=69 with 9 up moves, but y=9 at T=69, but to be at y=9 at T=69, I need y_69=9, which comes from y_68=8 and a_68=U.\n\nBut at T=68, if I am on y=8, occupied.\n\nIf I am on y=8 at T=68, collision, so I cannot be there to go up.\n\nTherefore, I cannot reach y=9 at T=68 or T=69 directly.\n\nNext possible is T=70.\n\nAt T=70, y=9.\n\nTo be at y=9 at T=70, I need y_70=9.\n\nWhich comes from y_69=8 and a_69=U.\n\nAt T=69, I am at y=8, but y=8 occupied at T=69, so collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nSimilarly, y_70=9 requires a_69=U from y_69=8.\n\nBut at T=69, y=8 occupied, so I cannot be on y=8 at T=69.\n\nTherefore, I cannot reach y=9 at T=69 or T=70 because it requires being on y=8 at T=68 or T=69, both occupied.\n\nT=70 y=9 requires being at y=8 at T=69 with a_69=U.\n\nBut T=69 y=8 occupied.\n\nSimilarly, T=71 y=9 requires at T=70 y=8 with a_70=U.\n\nNow, T=70, y=8 is not occupied, since occupied only at 60,61,68,69.\n\nT=70 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can be at y=8 at T=70, then go U to y=9 at T=71.\n\nAt T=71, y=9.\n\nNow, to be at y=8 at T=70.\n\nThat requires actions.\n\nFrom the beginning, I can reach y=6 at T=66, as before.\n\nThen I need to get to y=8 at T=70.\n\nAt T=66, y=6.\n\nThen at T=66, take action to set y_67.\n\nI can go to y=7 or y=6 or y=5.\n\ny=7 at T=67 is safe.\n\nSo go U to y=7 at T=67.\n\nAt T=67, y=7, safe.\n\nNow, I need to set y_68.\n\nI cannot go to y=7 or y=8 at T=68, so I must go down or stay, but stay at y=7 occupied.\n\nSo go D to y=6 at T=68.\n\nAt T=68, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at T=68, take action to set y_69.\n\nI cannot go to y=7 at T=69, occupied.\n\nSo I can go S to y=6 or D to y=5.\n\nSay go S to y=6 at T=69.\n\nAt T=69, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at T=69, take action to set y_70.\n\nI can go U to y=7 at T=70.\n\nAt T=70, y=7, safe.\n\nThen at T=70, take action a_70=U to y=8 at T=71.\n\nAt T=71, y=8, safe? T=71, y=8 not occupied, yes.\n\nThen at T=71, take a_71=U to y=9 at T=72.\n\nAt T=72, y=9.\n\nBut I want to be at y=8 at T=70.\n\nIn this, at T=70, I am at y=7, not y=8.\n\nFrom above, at T=70, y=7.\n\nThen I go to y=8 at T=71.\n\nTo be at y=8 at T=70, I need to have y_70=8.\n\nWhich comes from y_69=7 and a_69=U.\n\nBut at T=69, if I am at y=7, occupied, collision.\n\nIf I go from y_68 to y_69.\n\nBut at T=69, y=7 occupied.\n\nSo I cannot be at y=7 at T=69 to go up.\n\nSimilarly, the only way is to be at y=8 at T=70 directly, but I need to arrive from below.\n\nSo at T=69, I must be at y=7 or y=8 or y=9, but y=9 not yet.\n\nIf at T=69 I am at y=7, occupied, collision.\n\nIf at T=69 I am at y=8, occupied, collision.\n\nIf I am at y=6 at T=69, I can go to y=7 at T=70, not directly to y=8.\n\nSo I think it's impossible to be at y=8 at T=70 without being on y=7 or y=8 at T=69.\n\nThus, the earliest I can be at y=8 is T=70? No.\n\nAt T=67, I can be at y=7.\n\nThen at T=67, if I go U to y=8 at T=68, occupied.\n\nNot possible.\n\nAt T=70, I can be at y=7, as above.\n\nThen go to y=8 at T=71.\n\nThen to y=9 at T=72.\n\nH=12 actions.\n\nBut let's see if I can be at y=8 earlier at a safe time.\n\nFor example, T=67: but cannot, as min y=7 at T=67.\n\nT=68: occupied.\n\nT=69: occupied.\n\nT=70: possible if I can reach.\n\nTo be at y=8 at T=70, I need y_70=8.\n\ny_70 depends on y_69 and a_69.\n\ny_70 = y_69 + delta y.\n\nIf a_69=U, y_70 = y_69 +1\n\nIf a_69=S, y_70 = y_69\n\nIf a_69=D, y_70 = y_69 -1\n\nTo have y_70=8, with y_69 <=9.\n\nBut at T=69, y_69 must be such that it is not occupied if on freeway.\n\nBut y_69 could be 7,8, or 9.\n\nIf y_69=7, then a_69=U to y_70=8, but at T=69, if y_69=7, occupied, collision.\n\nIf y_69=8, then a_69=S or U or D, but to have y_70=8, a_69=S, but at T=69, y_69=8 occupied, collision.\n\nIf y_69=9, then a_69=S or D to y_70=9 or 8, but y=9 not freeway, but at T=69, if y_69=9, safe, but I want y_70=8, so a_69=D to y_70=8, but at T=70, y=8, which is safe, but I was at y=9 at T=69, which is fine, but I need to get to y=9 first, which defeats the purpose.\n\nSo not efficient.\n\nTherefore, I think the only way is to be at y=8 at T=70 or later safe time.\n\nT=70 is safe for y=8.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at T=70, I need to have y_70=8.\n\nWhich requires that at T=69, I am at y=7 or y=8 or y=9, but as above, y=7 and y=8 occupied at T=69, so I cannot be there.\n\ny=9 at T=69 is possible? If I can be at y=9 at T=69, then I don't need to go down.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at T=69, I need to be at y=8 at T=68 with a_68=U, but T=68 y=8 occupied, impossible.\n\nSimilarly, no way.\n\nThus, I cannot be at y=8 at T=70 directly.\n\nThe earliest safe time for y=8 is T=70, but I can be there only if I arrive from a state not occupied at T=69.\n\nBut at T=69, I must be on some y, and if I am on y=6, I can go to y=7 at T=70, not directly to y=8.\n\nSo I have to go through y=7 at T=70, then to y=8 at T=71.\n\nThen to y=9 at T=72.\n\nH=12.\n\nBut let's confirm with the sequence.\n\nAnother point: at T=66, I am at y=6.\n\nInstead of going to y=7 at T=67, I could go down to y=5 or something, but that might not help.\n\nFor example, at T=66, go D to y=5 at T=67.\n\nThen at T=67, y=5, safe.\n\nThen I can go up later.\n\nBut at T=68, I can be at y=6 or something.\n\nBut then to reach y=9, I need more up moves, so H larger.\n\nFor example, from T=67 y=5, go U to y=6 at T=68, y=6 safe.\n\nThen at T=68, go U to y=7? But at T=69 y=7 occupied, so not.\n\nGo S to y=6 at T=69, then U to y=7 at T=70, etc, same as before but I wasted a down move.\n\nSo worse.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 12, with the sequence as before.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nStart: T=60, y=0, a_60=U, to y=1 at T=61\n\nT=61, y=1, a_61=U, to y=2 at T=62\n\nT=62, y=2, a_62=U, to y=3 at T=63\n\nT=63, y=3, a_63=U, to y=4 at T=64\n\nT=64, y=4, a_64=U, to y=5 at T=65\n\nT=65, y=5, a_65=U, to y=6 at T=66\n\nT=66, y=6, a_66=U, to y=7 at T=67\n\nT=67, y=7, a_67=D, to y=6 at T=68  (to avoid occupation)\n\nT=68, y=6, a_68=S, to y=6 at T=69  (stay to avoid)\n\nT=69, y=6, a_69=U, to y=7 at T=70\n\nT=70, y=7, a_70=U, to y=8 at T=71\n\nT=71, y=8, a_71=U, to y=9 at T=72\n\nAt T=72, y=9.\n\nActions from turn 60 to turn 71, that's 12 actions.\n\nH=12.\n\nBut in the sequence, at T=68 and T=69, I am at y=6, which is safe.\n\nIs there a way with H=11?\n\nFor example, to be at y=9 at T=71.\n\nThen y_71=9, which requires y_70=8 and a_70=U.\n\nAt T=70, y=8 must be safe, which it is.\n\nBut how to be at y=8 at T=70.\n\ny_70=8 requires that at T=69, with some action.\n\nIf a_69=U, y_70= y_69 +1, so y_69=7\n\nBut at T=69, y=7 occupied, cannot.\n\nIf a_69=S, y_70=y_69, so if y_69=8, but T=69 y=8 occupied, cannot.\n\nIf a_69=D, y_70=y_69-1, so if y_69=9, y_70=8.\n\nBut to have y_69=9, I need to be at y=9 at T=69, which requires y_68=8 and a_68=U, but T=68 y=8 occupied, impossible.\n\nThus, cannot have y_70=8.\n\nTherefore, cannot reach y=9 at T=71.\n\nSimilarly for T=70.\n\nThus, minimal H=12.\n\nNow, about freeway 1: occupied at T=76-79, but since I reach y=9 at T=72, which is before 76, so no issue.\n\nAlso, I didn't need to worry about it.\n\nIn the sequence, I used a down move at T=67.\n\nBut perhaps I can avoid that.\n\nAnother idea: since y=7 is safe at T=67, I could go directly to y=8 at T=68, but occupied.\n\nNo.\n\nOr, I could from y=6 at T=66, go to y=5, but no benefit.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=8 at T=70 by coming from above, but I need to be above first.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo I think H=12 is minimal.\n\nNow, the answer should be the sequence of actions.\n\nt1=60.\n\nSo actions for turn 60 to turn 71.\n\nIn the answer format:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + H -1\n\nHere t1=60, H=12, so actions from turn 60 to turn 60+11=71.\n\nt from 0 to H-1=11, so turn 60 to 71.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: U\n\nTurn 62: U\n\nTurn 63: U\n\nTurn 64: U\n\nTurn 65: U\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: D  (from y=7 to y=6)\n\nIn the action: at turn T, action determines y_{T+1}\n\nIn this case, at turn 67, I am at y=7, I take D, so y_{68} = y_67 -1 =6\n\nThen at turn 68, I am at y=6.\n\nThen a_68=S, so y_69 = y_68 =6\n\nThen a_69=U, y_70=7\n\na_70=U, y_71=8\n\na_71=U, y_72=9\n\nYes.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 67: D\n\nBut is there a way without down move?\n\nFor example, at turn 66, I am at y=6, I could take S to stay at y=6 for T=67.\n\nThen at turn 67, y=6, I take U to y=7 at T=68? But at T=68, y=7 occupied, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt turn 66, take D to y=5 at T=67.\n\nThen at T=67, y=5, take U to y=6 at T=68.\n\nThen at T=68, y=6, take U to y=7? T=69 occupied, not.\n\nStill problem.\n\nSo I think with down move is necessary to avoid.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 later but with fewer actions? No, with down move, I have one extra action.\n\nH=12 with one down and one stay.\n\nWithout extra moves, min H=9, but not possible due to occupation.\n\nSo I think 12 is minimal.\n\nNow, about freeway 6: I was on y=6 at T=66, which is after T=60, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 60: U\n\nTurn 61: U\n\nTurn 62: U\n\nTurn 63: U\n\nTurn 64: U\n\nTurn 65: U\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: D\n\nTurn 68: S\n\nTurn 69: U\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nThen at turn 72, y=9.\n\nH=12 actions.\n\nIn the boxed answer.\n\nBut let's write it properly.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 60\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the sequence of actions must account for the car occupations at specific turns. The car occupation times are derived from the given car states and update rules:\n\n- Freeway 1 (y=1): Occupied at turns 76, 77, 78, 79.\n- Freeway 2 (y=2): Not occupied for \\(T \\geq 60\\).\n- Freeway 3 (y=3): Not occupied for \\(T \\geq 60\\).\n- Freeway 4 (y=4): Not occupied for \\(T \\geq 60\\).\n- Freeway 5 (y=5): Not occupied for \\(T \\geq 60\\).\n- Freeway 6 (y=6): Occupied only at turn 60.\n- Freeway 7 (y=7): Occupied at turns 60, 61, 68, 69.\n- Freeway 8 (y=8): Occupied at turns 60, 61, 68, 69.\n\nThe player starts at (0, 0) at turn 60, which is safe since y=0 has no cars. The goal is to reach y=9 at some turn \\(T\\) with minimal \\(H\\), where \\(H\\) is the number of actions taken from turn 60 to turn \\(60 + H - 1\\), and at turn \\(60 + H\\), the position is (0, 9).\n\nA sequence of actions that achieves this in \\(H = 12\\) turns is as follows:\n\n- From turn 60 to 66: Move up (U) each turn to increase y from 0 to 7 efficiently, as these rows and turns are safe.\n- At turn 67: Move down (D) to avoid being on y=7 at turn 68 (occupied) and instead go to y=6 at turn 68.\n- At turn 68: Stay (S) to remain at y=6 and avoid moving to y=7 at turn 69 (occupied).\n- At turn 69: Move up (U) to y=7 at turn 70, which is safe since y=7 is not occupied at turn 70.\n- At turn 70: Move up (U) to y=8 at turn 71, which is safe since y=8 is not occupied at turn 71.\n- At turn 71: Move up (U) to y=9 at turn 72.\n\nThis sequence ensures that the player is never on a freeway row (y=1 to 8) when it is occupied at that turn. Specifically:\n- At turn 67, moving down to y=6 avoids y=7 at turn 68 (occupied).\n- At turn 68, staying at y=6 avoids y=7 at turn 69 (occupied).\n- The occupation of y=1 at turns 76-79 is irrelevant as y=9 is reached by turn 72.\n\nThe minimal \\(H\\) is 12, as shorter sequences (e.g., \\(H=9\\) to \\(H=11\\)) are impossible due to the occupations at turns 68 and 69 on y=7 and y=8, which prevent direct or earlier arrival at y=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 60: U \\\\\nTurn 61: U \\\\\nTurn 62: U \\\\\nTurn 63: U \\\\\nTurn 64: U \\\\\nTurn 65: U \\\\\nTurn 66: U \\\\\nTurn 67: D \\\\\nTurn 68: S \\\\\nTurn 69: U \\\\\nTurn 70: U \\\\\nTurn 71: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,2) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 62, and the player starts at y=2.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S) each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9. So to reach y=9 from y=2, I need to increase y by 7, which means at least 7 Up moves, but I might need to stay or move down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 7.\n\nNow, about the cars: for each freeway k from 1 to 8, there are cars with positions given at turn t_1=62. The positions are given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For left-moving cars, head < tail, and for right-moving, head > tail? Let me read carefully.\n\nThe car update: for left-moving, span(t_1) = [h, τ] and at time T, it becomes [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]. Since it's left-moving, h and τ decrease with time.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, [τ, h] becomes [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)], so τ and h increase with time.\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (-42, -53, right, 3). But it says (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving, if direction is right, head should be greater than tail? Here head=-42, tail=-53, and since -42 > -53, yes, head is greater. And direction right, so as time increases, positions increase.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is at y_T, and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at that turn. Importantly, when the player moves to a new y, they are not on that new row until the next turn. So at turn T, if I move from y to y+1, at turn T I'm still on row y, and I arrive at row y+1 at turn T+1.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, I'm on row y_T. If I move, I change row at T+1.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn T for the row y_T I'm on at that turn.\n\nNow, I need to find a sequence of actions from t=62 onwards to reach y=9 as quickly as possible, avoiding being on a row where 0 is in the car span at that turn.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their positions at turn t=62.\n\nFreeway k=1: one car: head=-42, tail=-53, direction=right, speed=3. So since right-moving, span at t=62 is [τ, h] = [-53, -42]? No.\n\nAccording to the update: for right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h], and it moves to [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)].\n\nIn the table, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor freeway 1: head=-42, tail=-53, direction=right.\n\nFor right-moving, head is the front, tail is the back, so when moving right, head > tail.\n\nAt time T, the span is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)].\n\nSimilarly for left-moving.\n\nBut in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving except I need to check.\n\nFreeway 1: (-42, -53, right, 3) so head=-42, tail=-53, right, speed=3.\n\nSo at time t=62, span = [τ, h] = [-53, -42]? But the span is given as (head, tail), but in the update, for right-moving, we use τ and h with τ < h.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think of the position.\n\nLet me define the position at time t.\n\nFor a car, at time T, the span is:\n\nIf direction right: [tail + s(T - t_1), head + s(T - t_1)]\n\nIf direction left: [head - s(T - t_1), tail - s(T - t_1)]? Let's see from the update.\n\nFrom the update:\n\nLeft-moving: span(t_1) = [h, τ] → at T, [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nSince left-moving, h and τ decrease.\n\nIn the span, for left-moving, [h, τ] with h > τ? No, if it's [h, τ], and it moves left, h decreases, τ decreases, so if h > τ, it might be fine, but in the example, for freeway 1, it's given as (-42, -53), head=-42, tail=-53, and direction right, so head > tail.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, if direction left, head might be less than tail? But in this problem, all cars are right-moving, I think.\n\nLet's list all:\n\nFreeway 1: (-42, -53, right, 3) so head=-42, tail=-53, right, speed=3\n\nFreeway 2: (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2? (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 4: same (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 5: same (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 6: two cars: (-48, -59, right, 12) and (24, 13, right, 12)? (24, 13) head=24, tail=13, direction right, speed 12.\n\nBut head=24, tail=13, 24>13, so for right-moving, tail=13, head=24.\n\nFreeway 7: (-36, -47, right, 6) and (12, 1, right, 6) head=12, tail=1, right, speed 6.\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7: (-36, -47, right, 6) and (12, 1, right, 6)\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when 0 is in the car span for that row.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on row k at turn T, and 0 is in the span of some car on row k at that exact turn T.\n\nSo I need to find for each row and each turn, whether 0 is covered by a car.\n\nBut since the cars move at constant speed, I can find the times when 0 is occupied for each row.\n\nThen, for the player's path, I need that at each turn T, when on row y_T, 0 is not in the span for that row at T.\n\nAlso, the player starts at y=2 at t=62.\n\nGoal is to reach y=9.\n\nSince we want minimal H, probably we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoiding rows when they are occupied at 0.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway k, the times when 0 is in the span of a car on that row.\n\nFor a given row k, at time T, 0 is occupied if for some car on k, min_span <= 0 <= max_span.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving, let's handle the span.\n\nFor a right-moving car with head h, tail τ at t_1, speed s.\n\nAt time T, the tail position is τ + s(T - t_1)\n\nHead position is h + s(T - t_1)\n\nThen the span is [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)] since tail to head.\n\nFor collision, 0 in [min, max] where min is tail position, max is head position.\n\nSince tail < head for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all are right-moving.\n\nIn this case, all cars have direction right, so no left-moving.\n\nSo for each car, at time T, the position of tail is τ + s(T - t_1)\n\nPosition of head is h + s(T - t_1)\n\nThen 0 is in [tail_pos, head_pos] if tail_pos <= 0 <= head_pos.\n\nSince tail_pos <= head_pos.\n\nNow, t_1 = 62.\n\nLet me set t = T - t_1, so t=0 at current time.\n\nThen at time t (relative), tail_pos = τ + s * t\n\nhead_pos = h + s * t\n\nThen 0 is covered if τ + s t <= 0 <= h + s t\n\nWhich is equivalent to -h <= s t <= -τ? Let's solve inequalities.\n\nτ + s t <= 0 and 0 <= h + s t\n\nSo s t <= -τ and s t >= -h\n\nSince s > 0, we can divide.\n\nFirst inequality: s t <= -τ ⇒ t <= -τ / s\n\nSecond inequality: s t >= -h ⇒ t >= -h / s\n\nAlso, since τ and h are given, and for all cars, τ < h because head > tail for right-moving.\n\nNow, -h / s <= t <= -τ / s\n\nBecause t >= -h / s and t <= -τ / s\n\nFrom above:\n\ns t >= -h ⇒ t >= -h / s\n\ns t <= -τ ⇒ t <= -τ / s\n\nAnd since h > τ, -h < -τ, so -h/s < -τ/s, so the interval is [ -h/s , -τ/s ]\n\nt from -h/s to -τ/s inclusive.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: h=-42, τ=-53, s=3\n\nt >= -(-42)/3 = 42/3 = 14\n\nt <= -(-53)/3 = 53/3 ≈ 17.666\n\nSo t from 14 to 17.666, since t integer, t=14,15,16,17? Let's see.\n\nt >= 14 and t <= 53/3 = 17 + 2/3, so since t integer, t <= 17 because 17 <= 17.666, 18>17.666? 53/3=17.666, so t <= 17 since 17 <= 17.666, 18>17.666 not <=.\n\nt <= -τ/s = -(-53)/3 = 53/3 ≈17.666, so t <= 17 since t integer.\n\nSimilarly t >= -h/s = -(-42)/3=42/3=14\n\nSo t=14,15,16,17\n\nAt t=14: tail_pos = τ + s t = -53 + 3*14 = -53 + 42 = -11\n\nhead_pos = -42 + 42 = 0? -42 + 3*14 = -42 + 42 =0\n\nSo at t=14, head_pos=0, so 0 is covered (since span includes endpoints, I assume).\n\nSimilarly at t=17: tail_pos = -53 + 3*17 = -53 + 51 = -2\n\nhead_pos = -42 + 51 = 9\n\n0 between -2 and 9, yes.\n\nt=18: tail_pos = -53 + 54 =1, head_pos= -42+54=12, so 0 not between 1 and 12? 0 <1, not covered.\n\nSimilarly t=13: tail_pos=-53+39=-14, head_pos=-42+39=-3, 0 not between -14 and -3.\n\nSo for freeway 1, occupied at t=14,15,16,17.\n\nt relative to t_1, so absolute turn T = t_1 + t = 62 + t.\n\nBut since we start from t=0, and we care about future turns.\n\nNow similarly for other freeways.\n\nFirst, freeway 2: (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nh=-48, τ=-59, s=12\n\nt >= -h/s = -(-48)/12 = 48/12=4\n\nt <= -τ/s = -(-59)/12=59/12≈4.916\n\nSo t >=4 and t<=4.916, so t=4 only? t integer.\n\nt=4: tail_pos = τ + s t = -59 + 12*4 = -59 + 48 = -11\n\nhead_pos = -48 + 48 =0\n\nSo covered.\n\nt=5: tail_pos=-59+60=1, head_pos=-48+60=12, 0 not covered.\n\nt=3: tail_pos=-59+36=-23, head_pos=-48+36=-12, 0 not covered.\n\nSo only at t=4.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as 2, (-48,-59,right,12), so only t=4.\n\nFreeway 4: same, t=4.\n\nFreeway 5: same, t=4.\n\nNow freeway 6: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,12) same as above, occupied at t=4.\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,12) head=24, tail=13, direction right, speed 12.\n\nh=24, τ=13, s=12\n\nt >= -h/s = -24/12 = -2\n\nt <= -τ/s = -13/12 ≈ -1.083\n\nNow t >= -2 and t <= -1.083\n\nt is time relative, starting from 0, so t >=0, but here t >= -2, but t=0 is current time, future t>=0.\n\nt >= -2, but since t>=0, we have t <= -1.083, which is impossible because t>=0 > -1.083? Let's see.\n\nt >= -24/12 = -2\n\nt <= -13/12 ≈ -1.083\n\nBut for t >=0, t <= -1.083 is never true, so this car does not cover 0 at any t>=0.\n\nBecause at t=0, tail_pos=13 +12*0=13, head_pos=24+0=24, so [13,24], 0 not in.\n\nAs time increases, positions increase, so 0 never covered for t>=0.\n\nSo for freeway 6, only the first car matters, occupied at t=4.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nh=-36, τ=-47, s=6\n\nt >= -h/s = -(-36)/6 = 36/6=6\n\nt <= -τ/s = -(-47)/6=47/6≈7.833\n\nSo t=6,7\n\nt=6: tail_pos=-47+36=-11, head_pos=-36+36=0\n\nt=7: tail_pos=-47+42=-5, head_pos=-36+42=6\n\nt=8: tail_pos=-47+48=1, head_pos=-36+48=12, 0 not covered.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,6) head=12, tail=1, s=6\n\nt >= -h/s = -12/6 = -2\n\nt <= -τ/s = -1/6 ≈ -0.166\n\nt >= -2 and t <= -0.166, but t>=0, so no overlap, never covered for t>=0.\n\nAt t=0, tail=1, head=12, min=1, max=12, 0 not in.\n\nSo only first car matters, occupied at t=6 and t=7.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same as 7, occupied at t=6 and t=7.\n\nNow, freeway 1 we have t=14,15,16,17\n\nBut y=1 is freeway 1, and we start at y=2, so for row 1, occupied at t=14,15,16,17 relative to t_1.\n\nt relative, so absolute T=62 + t.\n\nNow, for each row, the times when it is occupied at x=0:\n\n- Row 1 (y=1): occupied at t=14,15,16,17 → T=76,77,78,79\n\n- Row 2 (y=2): but row 2 is freeway? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so row 1 to 8.\n\nAt current turn t=62, player is on row 2.\n\nIs row 2 occupied at t=0?\n\nFreeway 2: we have car, but at t=4 relative, which is T=66.\n\nAt t=0, for row 2: freeway 2 has car (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nAt t=0, tail_pos = -59 +0 = -59, head_pos = -48 +0 = -48, so [-59,-48], 0 not in, so not occupied at t=0.\n\nSimilarly, other rows: let's list for each row the occupied times.\n\nRow 1 (k=1): occupied t=14,15,16,17 → T=76,77,78,79\n\nRow 2 (k=2): freeway 2, occupied only at t=4 → T=66\n\nRow 3 (k=3): freeway 3, same as 2, occupied at t=4 → T=66\n\nRow 4 (k=4): freeway 4, same, occupied at t=4 → T=66\n\nRow 5 (k=5): freeway 5, same, occupied at t=4 → T=66\n\nRow 6 (k=6): freeway 6, occupied at t=4 (from first car) → T=66\n\nRow 7 (k=7): freeway 7, occupied at t=6,7 → T=68,69\n\nRow 8 (k=8): freeway 8, occupied at t=6,7 → T=68,69\n\nNow, rows 1 to 8, but we need to go from y=2 to y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, which is not a freeway, so no cars, always safe.\n\ny=0 also no cars, but we start from y=2, going up.\n\nPlayer can be on y=0 or y=9, no cars.\n\nNow, at current turn t=62, player is on y=2, and since at t=0 relative, row 2 is not occupied, as we saw.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nEach move, we can change y by -1,0,+1.\n\nTo minimize turns, we want to go up as much as possible.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on a row when it is occupied at x=0 at that turn.\n\nThe occupied times:\n\n- Row 2: occupied only at T=66 (t=4)\n\n- Row 3: occupied only at T=66\n\n- Row 4: at T=66\n\n- Row 5: at T=66\n\n- Row 6: at T=66\n\n- Row 7: occupied at T=68 and 69\n\n- Row 8: at T=68 and 69\n\n- Row 1: occupied at T=76,77,78,79, but since we are going up from y=2, we might not go to row 1, so row 1 might not be relevant if we don't go down.\n\nSimilarly, row 2 is occupied at T=66, but at other times, it might be safe.\n\nNow, we start at y=2 at t=62.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal y change is 7, so minimal H=7 if we go up every turn.\n\nBut we need to check if we can go directly up without hitting occupied times.\n\nSuppose we go up every turn from t=62 onwards.\n\nAt turn t=62: y=2, not occupied.\n\nAction U: move to y=3 at next turn.\n\nAt turn t=63: now on y=3, and row 3 is not occupied at t=63? Occupied only at t=4 relative, T=66.\n\nt=63 is t=1 relative? t relative = T - 62.\n\nSo at T=63, t=1.\n\nRow 3 occupied at t=4, T=66.\n\nSo at T=63, t=1, row 3: freeway 3, at t=1, tail_pos = -59 +12*1 = -59+12= -47, head_pos= -48+12= -36? Freeway 3 car: h=-48, τ=-59, s=12\n\nAt t=1, tail_pos = τ + s t = -59 +12*1 = -47\n\nhead_pos = h + s t = -48 +12 = -36\n\nSpan [-47,-36], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=64, t=2, y=4 if we go up.\n\nRow 4: similar, tail_pos=-59+24= -35? τ=-59, s=12, t=2, tail_pos=-59+24=-35, head_pos=-48+24=-24, [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nT=65, t=3, y=5: row 5, tail_pos=-59+36=-23, head_pos=-48+36=-12, [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nT=66, t=4, y=6: now row 6 is occupied at t=4.\n\nIf we are on y=6 at T=66, row 6 occupied.\n\nProblem.\n\nIn the sequence: start T=62, y=2, action U to go to y=3 at T=63.\n\nT=63, y=3, action U to go to y=4 at T=64.\n\nT=64, y=4, action U to y=5 at T=65.\n\nT=65, y=5, action U to y=6 at T=66.\n\nAt T=66, we are on y=6, and row 6 is occupied at T=66, so collision.\n\nCannot go directly up because at T=66, when we are on y=6, it is occupied.\n\nWe need to avoid being on rows 2 to 6 at T=66, since all are occupied except row 1 and 7,8, but row 1 not relevant.\n\nRows 2,3,4,5,6 all occupied at T=66.\n\nRow 7 and 8 occupied at T=68,69.\n\nNow, we are at y=2 at T=62.\n\nWe need to be not on rows 2-6 at T=66.\n\nT=66 is 4 turns later, t=4.\n\nCurrent turn T=62, t=0.\n\nAfter k turns, at time T=62+k.\n\nWe need to plan the path.\n\nSince we need to reach y=9, and to avoid T=66 on rows 2-6.\n\nOne way is to be above row 6 by T=66, or below, but below might not help since we need to go up.\n\ny=0 or 1, but row 1 has cars later, but at T=66, row 1 is not occupied yet, occupied only at T=76 etc.\n\nAt T=66, t=4, row 1: freeway 1, at t=4, tail_pos=-53+3*4= -53+12= -41, head_pos=-42+12=-30, [-41,-30], 0 not in, so row 1 safe at T=66.\n\nSimilarly, row 7 at T=66, t=4, row 7: freeway 7, cars, at t=4, first car: tail_pos=-47+6*4= -47+24= -23, head_pos=-36+24= -12, [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: tail=1+24=25, head=12+24=36, [25,36], 0 not in. So row 7 safe at t=4.\n\nSimilarly row 8 safe.\n\nAt T=66, rows 1,7,8 are safe, rows 2-6 occupied.\n\nNow back to the player.\n\nAt T=62, on y=2.\n\nWe need to be not on y=2,3,4,5,6 at T=66.\n\nT=66 is the fourth turn from now? Let's list the turns:\n\nTurn T: action at T determines y_{T+1}, but position at T.\n\nAt time T, we are at position (0, y_T), and we take action a_T to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nFor collision at time T, it depends on y_T and the cars at that time.\n\nAt T=62, y=2, safe.\n\nAfter action at T=62, we move to y_{63} at time T=63.\n\nWe need that at each time T, y_T is safe.\n\nSpecifically, at T=66, y_66 must not be in {2,3,4,5,6} because those are occupied.\n\ny_66 must be 0,1,7,8,9 or something, but 9 is goal, we might not be there yet.\n\nPossible safe rows at T=66: y=0,1,7,8 (since y=9 not freeway, safe, but we are at y=2, to reach y=9 in 4 turns? From T=62 to T=66 is 4 turns, but at T=66, position y_66.\n\nStart at T=62, y=2.\n\nAfter one action, at T=63, y_{63} = y_62 + Δy, depending on a_{62}.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTo have y_66 not in 2-6.\n\ny_66 could be 1,7,8,9,0.\n\nBut y=0 or 1 might be too low, and we need to go up eventually.\n\nSince rows 7 and 8 are safe at T=66, we could be on row 7 or 8 at that time.\n\nBut row 7 and 8 have occupied times at T=68 and 69, but we can deal with that later.\n\nFirst, let's get past T=66.\n\nNow, from y=2 at T=62.\n\nWe have 4 turns: T=62,63,64,65 to determine y_63,y_64,y_65,y_66.\n\ny_66 depends on actions from T=62 to T=65.\n\nEach action changes y by at most 1, so in 4 actions, y can change from -4 to +4.\n\nCurrent y=2, so y_66 can be from 2-4= -2, but y min 0, so 0 to 6? y_62=2.\n\nAfter k actions, y_{62+k} = y_62 + sum_{i=0}^{k-1} Δy_{62+i}\n\nFor y_66, which is at time T=66, so after 4 steps, k=4.\n\ny_66 = y_62 + Δy_62 + Δy_63 + Δy_64 + Δy_65\n\nΔy in {-1,0,1}\n\ny_62=2, so y_66 = 2 + sum of four Δy, each in {-1,0,1}, so y_66 between 2-4= -2? min y=0, so y_66 in {0,1,2,3,4,5,6} since max 2+4=6.\n\nBut we need y_66 not in {2,3,4,5,6}, so only possible y_66=0 or 1.\n\ny_66 must be 0 or 1 to be safe at T=66.\n\ny=0 or y=1.\n\ny=1 is freeway, but at T=66 it is safe, as we saw.\n\ny=0 no problem.\n\nNow, from y=2, to reach y=0 or 1 in 4 turns? But y=0 or 1 is lower, and we need to go up to 9, which might take more turns.\n\nWe could reach y=0 or 1 at T=66.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nBut let's see the actions.\n\nSince we need to decrease y to 0 or 1 by T=66.\n\ny_66 =0 or 1.\n\nCurrent y_62=2.\n\nSo we need to decrease by at least 1, or stay and decrease later.\n\nIn 4 steps, we can decrease to 0 or 1.\n\nFor example, go down at some turns.\n\nBut we also need to eventually go up to 9.\n\nMoreover, we have to avoid other occupied times.\n\nFirst, let's list all occupied times for each row:\n\nRow 1: occupied T=76,77,78,79 (t=14,15,16,17)\n\nRow 2: occupied only T=66 (t=4)\n\nRow 3: only T=66\n\nRow 4: only T=66\n\nRow 5: only T=66\n\nRow 6: only T=66\n\nRow 7: occupied T=68,69 (t=6,7)\n\nRow 8: occupied T=68,69\n\nNow, row 1 occupied later, but if we go to y=1 at T=66, we need to leave before T=76.\n\nBut T=76 is far, we can reach y=9 before that.\n\nSimilarly, rows 7 and 8 occupied at T=68,69.\n\nNow, back to the plan.\n\nWe need y_66 = 0 or 1.\n\nLet's choose y_66=1, for example, since it's closer to the path.\n\ny=1 at T=66.\n\nNow, from y=2 at T=62, to y=1 at T=66.\n\ny_66 =1.\n\ny_62=2.\n\nSo sum of Δy from T=62 to T=65 must be -1, since y_66 = y_62 + Δy_62 + Δy_63 + Δy_64 + Δy_65\n\ny_66 = y_65 + Δy_65, no.\n\nPosition: at time T, y_T.\n\nAfter action at T, y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nSo y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nThus, for T=66, y_66 = y_65 + Δy_65\n\nBut y_65 = y_64 + Δy_64, and so on.\n\nTo have y_66=1.\n\nSince we start at y_62=2, and we have actions at T=62,63,64,65.\n\nAfter action at T=65, we set y_66.\n\nThe position y_66 depends on the actions.\n\nSpecifically, y_63 = y_62 + Δy_62\n\ny_64 = y_63 + Δy_63 = y_62 + Δy_62 + Δy_63\n\ny_65 = y_64 + Δy_64 = y_62 + Δy_62 + Δy_63 + Δy_64\n\ny_66 = y_65 + Δy_65 = y_62 + Δy_62 + Δy_63 + Δy_64 + Δy_65\n\nSo y_66 = 2 + sum_{i=62 to 65} Δy_i\n\nSet y_66=1, so 2 + sum Δy_i =1, so sum Δy_i = -1 for i=62,63,64,65.\n\nSimilarly, if y_66=0, sum Δy_i = -2.\n\nNow, each Δy in {-1,0,1}.\n\nAlso, we need to be safe at each intermediate turn.\n\nAt T=62, y=2, safe.\n\nNow, for T=63, y_63 must be safe, etc.\n\nSince rows 2-6 are safe except at T=66, and T=66 is the only critical point for rows 2-6, other times they are safe.\n\nFor example, row 2: occupied only at T=66, so at other times, safe.\n\nSimilarly for row 3,4,5,6.\n\nRow 7 and 8 have issues at T=68,69.\n\nBut for now, to reach y_66=1.\n\ny_66=1, which is row 1, but at T=66, row 1 is safe, as we saw.\n\nNow, to have sum of Δy from T=62 to 65 = -1.\n\nWe can do this in different ways.\n\nBut we also need to avoid being on row 1 later when it is occupied, but T=76 is far, so we can move up before that.\n\nFirst, let's get to y_66=1.\n\nPossible sequences: for example, at T=62, action S or D or U.\n\nIf we do S at T=62, y_63=2 (same)\n\nThen need to decrease later.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut we need to ensure that at each turn, the position is safe.\n\nFor example, at T=63, if y_63=2, row 2 is safe at T=63, since only occupied at T=66.\n\nSimilarly, if y_63=3, row 3 safe at T=63, etc.\n\nOnly at T=66 they are occupied.\n\nSo for T=63,64,65, all rows 1-8 are safe except row 1 at later times, but at T=63,64,65, row 1 is safe, since occupied only from T=76.\n\nSimilarly rows 7,8 safe at T=63,64,65? T=65 is t=3 relative.\n\nRow 7 at t=3: freeway 7, first car tail_pos=-47+18= -29, head_pos=-36+18=-18, [-29,-18], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car tail=1+18=19, head=12+18=30, [19,30], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly row 8 safe.\n\nSo at T=63,64,65, all rows are safe, no occupation.\n\nOnly at T=66, rows 2-6 occupied.\n\nSo for the path to y_66=1, we just need to arrive at y=1 at T=66 safely, and since all positions before are safe, we can choose any actions that decrease y by 1 in four moves.\n\nFor example, we can do: at T=62, action S, so y_63=2\n\nT=63, action S, y_64=2\n\nT=64, action S, y_65=2\n\nT=65, action D, so y_66= y_65 + (-1) =2-1=1\n\nThen at T=66, y=1, safe.\n\nBut we wasted turns staying, which might not be minimal.\n\nSince we need sum Δy = -1 over four actions, we can do one down and three stays, or other combinations.\n\nBut to minimize time, we should go down directly if possible, but we need to reach y=9, so going down might add extra steps.\n\nIn this case, from y=1 at T=66, to y=9, we need to go up 8 steps, but we can do it in 8 turns if no obstacles.\n\nBut there are obstacles at rows 7 and 8 at T=68,69.\n\nFirst, let's get to y_66=1.\n\nTo save time, we should decrease as soon as possible, so we can be at lower y earlier, but since we need to go up, it might not help.\n\nFor example, at T=62, action D, so y_63=2 + (-1)=1\n\nThen at T=63, we are on y=1.\n\nNow, y=1 at T=63, which is safe, since row 1 not occupied until later.\n\nThen at T=63, if we stay or go up.\n\nBut we need y_66=1, so if we are at y=1 at T=63, we need to stay or go down and up, but that might add steps.\n\nBetter to stay or move to avoid extra changes.\n\nSince we need y_66=1, and we are at y=1 at T=63, then we can stay for the next turns until T=66.\n\nBut let's list the actions.\n\nOption 1: Go down at T=62 to y=1 at T=63.\n\nThen stay at T=63, T=64, T=65, so y_64=1, y_65=1, y_66=1.\n\nActions: T=62: D, then T=63: S, T=64: S, T=65: S\n\nThen at T=66, y=1.\n\nFrom here, we need to go to y=9.\n\ny=1 to y=9, need +8, so at least 8 up moves.\n\nBut we have to avoid rows 7 and 8 at T=68 and 69.\n\nFirst, at T=66, we are on y=1.\n\nNow, we can start going up.\n\nBut row 7 and 8 occupied at T=68 and 69.\n\nSo we need not to be on row 7 or 8 at T=68 or T=69.\n\nT=68 is t=6 relative, T=69 is t=7.\n\nNow, from T=66, y=1.\n\nIf we go up every turn:\n\nT=66: action U, so y_67 = y_66 +1 =1+1=2\n\nT=67: action U, y_68=3\n\nBut at T=68, y=3, which is row 3, but row 3 is safe except at T=66, which is past, so safe.\n\nBut row 7 and 8 occupied at T=68, but we are not on them yet.\n\nContinue: T=68: action U, y_69=4\n\nT=69: action U, y_70=5\n\nAnd so on, up to y=9.\n\nBut at T=68, we are on y=3, not row 7 or 8.\n\nAt T=69, y=4, not 7 or 8.\n\nSo no problem with row 7 or 8 occupation since we are below.\n\nThen we can keep going up: T=70: y=6, T=71: y=7, T=72: y=8, T=73: y=9.\n\nBut at T=73, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, from T=66 to T=73, 7 turns to go from y=1 to y=9 with 8 up moves? y_66=1, after U at T=66, y_67=2, ..., after U at T=73, y_74=9? Let's count.\n\nAt T=66, y=1.\n\nAction at T=66: U → y_67=2\n\nAction at T=67: U → y_68=3\n\nAction at T=68: U → y_69=4\n\nAction at T=69: U → y_70=5\n\nAction at T=70: U → y_71=6\n\nAction at T=71: U → y_72=7\n\nAction at T=72: U → y_73=8\n\nAction at T=73: U → y_74=9\n\nSo at T=74, y=9.\n\nBut we reach position at time T, so at T=74, y=9.\n\nNumber of turns from start: from T=62 to T=74, that's 13 turns? T=62 to T=74 is 12 steps? Let's see.\n\nStart at T=62, y=2.\n\nAfter H turns, we reach y=9 at turn T=62 + H -1? The sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1, so after H actions, we reach at time T=62 + H.\n\nDefine: we start at time T=62, position y_62.\n\nAfter action a_{62}, we have y_{63}, and so on, up to after action a_{t}, we have y_{t+1}.\n\nWe want y_{t} =9 for some t.\n\nThe minimal H such that after H actions, we are at y=9.\n\nThe position after H actions is y_{62 + H}.\n\nSet y_{62 + H} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1 correspond to times T=62 to 62+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at time T=62 + H, y=9.\n\nIn the earlier plan, we have:\n\nFirst part: to get to y_66=1.\n\nT=66 is T=62 +4, so after 4 actions? T=62 to T=63: one action, T=63 to T=64: second, ..., up to T=65 to T=66: fourth action.\n\nAfter action at T=65, we have y_66.\n\nThen from there, to reach y=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, at T=66, y=1.\n\nThen actions: T=66: U → y_67=2\n\n...\n\nT=73: U → y_74=9\n\nSo y_74=9, which is at time T=74.\n\nNow, from start T=62 to T=74, that's 12 time steps, but number of actions: from T=62 to T=73, we have actions at T=62 to T=73, that's 12 actions? T=62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73: 12 actions.\n\nAfter 12 actions, at T=74, y=9.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, so H=12.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nIn the first part, we spent 4 actions to go from y=2 to y=1, but we only need to decrease by 1, so we can do it faster.\n\nFor example, at T=62, action D, so y_63=1 directly.\n\nThen we are at y=1 at T=63.\n\nBut we need y_66=1, so from T=63 to T=66, we need to stay at y=1.\n\nSo actions: T=62: D → y_63=1\n\nThen T=63: S → y_64=1\n\nT=64: S → y_65=1\n\nT=65: S → y_66=1\n\nSame as before, 4 actions to be at y=1 at T=66.\n\nBut at T=63, we are already at y=1, but we have to wait until T=66 to be safe? No, at T=63, y=1 is safe, but we need to avoid being on rows 2-6 at T=66, but at T=63, we are on row 1, which is fine.\n\nBut for the path to y=9, we can start going up earlier.\n\nSince at T=63, we are at y=1, and T=66 is later, we can go up from T=63 onwards.\n\nBut we need to avoid row 7 and 8 at T=68 and 69.\n\nLet's see.\n\nStart: T=62, y=2, action D → y_63=1\n\nNow at T=63, y=1, safe.\n\nNow we can go up.\n\nBut if we go up immediately: T=63: action U → y_64=2\n\nBut at T=64, y=2, which is safe, since row 2 occupied only at T=66.\n\nThen T=64: action U → y_65=3\n\nT=65: action U → y_66=4\n\nBut at T=66, y=4, which is row 4, occupied at T=66! Collision.\n\nWe cannot be on y=4 at T=66.\n\nIn this case, with action at T=63: U, we go to y=2 at T=64, then to y=3 at T=65, y=4 at T=66, which is occupied.\n\nNot good.\n\nAfter T=63 y=1, if we stay: T=63: S → y_64=1\n\nThen T=64: S → y_65=1\n\nT=65: S → y_66=1\n\nSame as before.\n\nOr, we can go up later.\n\nBut to save time, from y=1 at T=63, we can go up but need to time it so that at T=66 we are not on 2-6.\n\nBut at T=66, we need to be on 0 or 1.\n\nSo if we are at y=1 at T=63, we must stay until T=66 to be at y=1 at T=66.\n\nIf we go up before, we might be on higher row at T=66, which is dangerous.\n\nFor example, if at T=63, action U, y_64=2\n\nThen at T=64, if we do nothing, y_65=2, y_66=2, occupied.\n\nIf we go down, y_65=1, then at T=65, action S or D, y_66=1 or 0, safe, but we added extra moves.\n\nFor instance: T=62: D → y_63=1\n\nT=63: U → y_64=2\n\nT=64: D → y_65=1\n\nT=65: S → y_66=1\n\nThen at T=66, y=1, safe.\n\nBut we did U and D unnecessarily, wasting actions.\n\nWorse than staying.\n\nSo the efficient way is to go down to y=1 at T=63, then stay until T=66.\n\nBut we can go to y=0, but y=0 is also safe.\n\ny=0 at T=66.\n\nFor example, T=62: D → y_63=1\n\nT=63: D → y_64=0\n\nThen at T=64, y=0, safe.\n\nBut we need y_66=0 or 1.\n\nIf we stay: T=64: S → y_65=0\n\nT=65: S → y_66=0\n\nThen at T=66, y=0.\n\nFrom y=0, to y=9, need +9, more moves.\n\nWorse than being at y=1.\n\nSo best to be at y=1 at T=66 with minimal actions.\n\nThus, from T=62: action D → y_63=1\n\nThen T=63: S → y_64=1\n\nT=64: S → y_65=1\n\nT=65: S → y_66=1\n\nActions: D, S, S, S for T=62 to T=65.\n\nNow from T=66, y=1, we go up.\n\nBut we have to avoid rows 7 and 8 at T=68 and 69.\n\nNow, rows 7 and 8 occupied at T=68 and T=69.\n\nSo we need not to be on row 7 or 8 at those times.\n\nNow, from T=66, y=1.\n\nWe can go up.\n\nIf we go up every turn:\n\nT=66: U → y_67=2\n\nT=67: U → y_68=3\n\nAt T=68, y=3, not 7 or 8, safe.\n\nT=68: U → y_69=4\n\nAt T=69, y=4, not 7 or 8, safe.\n\nT=69: U → y_70=5\n\nT=70: U → y_71=6\n\nT=71: U → y_72=7\n\nT=72: U → y_73=8\n\nT=73: U → y_74=9\n\nAt T=74, y=9.\n\nBut at T=72, y=7? y_72=7, row 7.\n\nIs row 7 occupied at T=72?\n\nT=72 relative t= T - 62 = 72-62=10.\n\nRow 7 occupied at t=6 and 7, T=68 and 69.\n\nAt t=10, T=72, row 7: freeway 7, first car: at t=10, tail_pos= -47 +6*10= -47+60=13, head_pos=-36+60=24, [13,24], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: tail=1+60=61, head=12+60=72, [61,72], 0 not in. So safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 safe.\n\nAt T=73, y=8, row 8 at t=11, tail_pos for first car: -47+66=19, head=-36+66=30, [19,30], 0 not in.\n\nSafe.\n\nThen T=73: U to y_74=9.\n\nSo reached in 12 actions.\n\nBut we can reach faster by not staying so long.\n\nEarlier at T=63, we were at y=1, but we stayed to avoid T=66 issue.\n\nSince rows 2-6 are only occupied at T=66, we can be on them before or after.\n\nFor example, we can go up quickly to y=7 or above by T=66, but y=7 at T=66 is safe, since row 7 not occupied at T=66.\n\nAt T=66, row 7 is safe, as we saw earlier.\n\nSimilarly row 8.\n\nAnd y=9.\n\nSo if we can reach y=7 or higher by T=66, we can be safe at T=66 and also closer to goal.\n\nCurrent y_62=2.\n\nT=66 is 4 turns later.\n\ny_66 = 2 + sum of four Δy.\n\nTo reach y=7, we need sum Δy = +5, but each |Δy|<=1, so in 4 actions, max increase is 4, to y=6, min decrease to -2, but y=6 at T=66 is occupied, as row 6.\n\ny=7: 2 + sum =7, sum=5, impossible in 4 moves, max sum=4, y=6.\n\ny=6 at T=66 occupied.\n\ny=7 not reachable in 4 moves from y=2.\n\nMax y_66=2+4=6, which is occupied.\n\nMin y_66=0 or 1.\n\nSo cannot be above 6 at T=66.\n\nThus, only options are y=0 or 1 at T=66.\n\nSo we must be at low y at that time.\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut in the go up phase, we can avoid the row 7 and 8 occupation by timing.\n\nIn the current plan, we go from y=1 to y=9 in 8 moves, but since we start from low, it takes time.\n\nAnother idea: after T=66, we can go up, but for rows 7 and 8, occupied at T=68 and 69, so we should not be on row 7 at T=68 or T=69, similarly for 8.\n\nSo if we can be on row 7 before T=68 or after T=69.\n\nSimilarly for row 8.\n\nFor example, row 7: safe except T=68 and 69.\n\nSo we can be on row 7 at T=67 or T=70, etc.\n\nSimilarly row 8.\n\nIn the path, when we reach row 7, it should not be at T=68 or 69.\n\nSimilarly for row 8.\n\nIn the current plan, we reach row 7 at T=72, which is after, safe.\n\nBut we can reach earlier.\n\nFor example, from T=66, y=1, instead of going up slowly, we can go up faster, but we have to hit row 7 at safe time.\n\nFirst, let's list the times we need to avoid for each row:\n\nRow 7: avoid T=68 and T=69\n\nRow 8: avoid T=68 and T=69\n\nOther rows no issue after T=66.\n\nRow 1 occupied later, but we are going up, so not relevant.\n\nNow from T=66, y=1.\n\nWe want to go to y=9.\n\nThe critical rows are 7 and 8 only at specific times.\n\nWe can pass row 7 quickly at a safe time.\n\nFor example, to be on row 7 at T=67 or T=70.\n\nSimilarly for row 8.\n\nNow, from y=1 at T=66.\n\nIf we go up continuously, we reach:\n\nT=66: y=1\n\nAfter U: y_67=2\n\nAfter U: y_68=3\n\nAfter U: y_69=4\n\nAfter U: y_70=5\n\nAfter U: y_71=6\n\nAfter U: y_72=7\n\nAfter U: y_73=8\n\nAfter U: y_74=9\n\nAt T=72, y=7, which is safe since T=72 not 68 or 69.\n\nBut we can reach row 7 earlier.\n\nFor example, to be on row 7 at T=67.\n\nFrom y=1 at T=66, after action U at T=66, y_67=2, not 7.\n\nTo reach y=7 at T=67, we need y_67=7, but from y_66=1, after one action, y_67=1,2, or 0, cannot be 7.\n\nImpossible.\n\nSimilarly, at T=70: y_70=7 possible.\n\nFrom y=1 at T=66, to y=7 at T=70.\n\nT=70 is 4 turns later.\n\ny_70 = y_66 + Δy_66 + Δy_67 + Δy_68 + Δy_69\n\nSet y_70=7, y_66=1, so 1 + sum_{i=66 to 69} Δy_i =7, so sum=6.\n\nIn 4 actions, max sum=4, min sum=-4, so sum=6 impossible.\n\nMax y_70=1+4=5.\n\ny_70 <= y_66 + 4 = 1+4=5.\n\nCannot reach y=7 by T=70 from y=1 at T=66 in 4 moves.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at T=71: y_71 = y_66 + sum_{i=66 to 70} Δy_i? y_71 = y_70 + Δy_70, but y_70 <=5, so y_71 <=6.\n\nStill not 7.\n\ny_72 <= y_66 + 6 =1+6=7, so possible y_72=7.\n\nAs in the current plan.\n\nSimilarly, cannot reach earlier.\n\nSo from y=1 at T=66, earliest to reach y=7 is at T=72 with all up moves.\n\ny_66=1\n\nT=66: U → y_67=2\n\nT=67: U → y_68=3\n\nT=68: U → y_69=4\n\nT=69: U → y_70=5\n\nT=70: U → y_71=6\n\nT=71: U → y_72=7\n\nYes, at T=72, y=7.\n\nThen to y=8 at T=73, y=9 at T=74.\n\nNow, but at T=72, y=7, safe.\n\nWe can reach y=9 at T=74.\n\nBut H=12 actions from T=62 to T=73.\n\nActions at T=62 to T=73 inclusive, 12 actions.\n\nT=62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73: 12 turns.\n\nBut we can reduce by not staying in the beginning.\n\nIn the first part, to reach y_66=1, we used 4 actions, but we only need to decrease by 1, so we can do it with one down and then stays, but we have to fill until T=65.\n\nSince we must be at y=0 or 1 at T=66, and we start at y=2, we need at least one down move, and the time is fixed, we have to spend 4 actions to cover the turns.\n\nThe actions are per turn, so we must take an action at each turn from T=62 to T=65 to determine the state at T=66.\n\nSo we need exactly 4 actions for the first 4 turns.\n\nThe minimal number of actions to change y is not the issue; we have to take actions for each turn.\n\nSo we cannot save actions in that phase.\n\nAnother idea: instead of going down to y=1, we can go up to y=6 but before T=66, then at T=66 be on safe row.\n\nBut at T=66, rows above 6 are 7,8,9, which are safe, but we cannot reach y=7 by T=66 from y=2, as max y=6.\n\ny=6 at T=66 occupied.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nPerhaps stay at y=2 for some turns, but we need to be not at y=2 at T=66.\n\nFor example, at T=62: S → y_63=2\n\nT=63: S → y_64=2\n\nT=64: D → y_65=1\n\nT=65: S → y_66=1\n\nThen same as before.\n\nOr, at T=62: U → y_63=3\n\nThen at T=63: U → y_64=4\n\nT=64: U → y_65=5\n\nBut at T=65, y=5, if we do U, y_66=6, occupied.\n\nIf we do D, y_66=4, occupied.\n\nIf S, y_66=5, occupied.\n\nAll occupied at T=66.\n\nSo must decrease to 0 or 1.\n\nThus, no choice but to be at low y at T=66.\n\nThen go up.\n\nIn the go up phase, we can optimize for rows 7 and 8.\n\nRows 7 and 8 are occupied only at T=68 and 69, so we can pass them before or after.\n\nFor example, to be on row 7 at T=67 or T=70.\n\nSimilarly for row 8.\n\nFrom y=1 at T=66, we can reach row 7 at T=72 as min.\n\nBut T=72 is after T=69, so safe.\n\nCan we reach earlier?\n\nSuppose we go up faster, but from y=1, it takes 6 up moves to reach y=7 at T=72.\n\nSince y_66=1, after 6 up moves, y_{72}=7.\n\nCannot faster.\n\nPerhaps from the start, we go up to y=6 quickly but before T=66, then at T=66 go to y=7, but y=7 not reachable at T=66.\n\nImpossible.\n\nAnother idea: at T=66, we are at y=1, but we can go to y=0 earlier or something, but not helpful.\n\nPerhaps we don't need to stay at y=1; we can be at y=1 before and go up, but we have to ensure not on 2-6 at T=66.\n\nFor example, suppose at T=62: U → y_63=3\n\nBut then we are higher, harder to get to low at T=66.\n\nNot good.\n\nOr, at T=62: D → y_63=1\n\nThen at T=63: since we are at y=1, and T=66 is later, we can go up now.\n\nBut if we go up at T=63: U → y_64=2\n\nThen at T=64, y=2, safe.\n\nT=64: U → y_65=3\n\nT=65: now at T=65, y=3, we need to not be on 3 at T=66, so at T=65, action D → y_66=2, but y=2 at T=66 occupied! Collision.\n\nAction U → y_66=4, occupied.\n\nAction S → y_66=3, occupied.\n\nAll bad.\n\nAfter T=63 y=1, if we go up at T=64: but T=64 action, y_65=2\n\nThen T=65 action, if D, y_66=1; if S, y_66=2 occupied; if U, y_66=3 occupied.\n\nSo only if we do D at T=65, y_66=1.\n\nBut we moved to y=2 and back, wasting actions.\n\nFor example: T=62: D → y_63=1\n\nT=63: S → y_64=1  (stay, not up)\n\nT=64: U → y_65=2\n\nT=65: D → y_66=1\n\nThen at T=66, y=1, but we used extra U and D.\n\nCompared to: T=62: D → y_63=1\n\nT=63: S → y_64=1\n\nT=64: S → y_65=1\n\nT=65: S → y_66=1\n\nThis has only one down and three stays, while the other has down, stay, up, down: two downs and one up, worse.\n\nSo the first way is better.\n\nThus, for minimal actions, we should do the direct: go down to y=1 quickly and stay until T=66.\n\nThen go up continuously to y=9.\n\nBut in go up, we reach y=9 at T=74.\n\nTotal actions from T=62 to T=73.\n\nNumber of actions: from T=62 to T=73 inclusive, that's 12 actions.\n\nH=12.\n\nBut we can save by going to y=0 at T=66, but that would take more up moves, worse.\n\nPerhaps during go up, we can skip some rows or something, but no, we have to move step by step.\n\nAnother thought: for rows 7 and 8, since they are occupied at T=68 and 69, we can be on row 6 or row 9 at those times, but we need to pass row 7 and 8 at safe times.\n\nFor example, if we can be on row 7 at T=67, but from y=1 at T=66, impossible.\n\nT=67: from y=1, after one move, y_67=2 max.\n\nCannot.\n\nT=70: y_70 <=5 from y=1, not 7.\n\nSo impossible to reach row 7 before T=72 from y=1 at T=66.\n\nThus, the only way is as above.\n\nBut let's confirm the sequence.\n\nActions:\n\nT=62: D  (to y_63=1)\n\nT=63: S  (y_64=1)\n\nT=64: S  (y_65=1)\n\nT=65: S  (y_66=1)\n\nT=66: U  (y_67=2)\n\nT=67: U  (y_68=3)\n\nT=68: U  (y_69=4)\n\nT=69: U  (y_70=5)\n\nT=70: U  (y_71=6)\n\nT=71: U  (y_72=7)\n\nT=72: U  (y_73=8)\n\nT=73: U  (y_74=9)\n\nAt T=74, y=9, so we reached at turn T=74.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from T=62 to T=73, 12 actions.\n\nH=12.\n\nBut is there a way to reach faster?\n\nSuppose we go to y=0 at T=66.\n\nFor example, T=62: D → y_63=1\n\nT=63: D → y_64=0\n\nT=64: S → y_65=0\n\nT=65: S → y_66=0\n\nThen from y=0, to y=9, need 9 up moves.\n\nT=66: U → y_67=1\n\n...\n\nUp to T=75: U → y_76=9, 10 actions from T=66 to T=75, plus 4 from start, total 14, worse.\n\nNot good.\n\nPerhaps we can avoid going down by using row 1 or something, but row 1 occupied later.\n\nAnother idea: at T=62, we go up to y=3, but then we have to get down by T=66.\n\nFor example, T=62: U → y_63=3\n\nT=63: U → y_64=4\n\nT=64: U → y_65=5\n\nT=65: D → y_66=4, but occupied.\n\nNot possible.\n\nT=62: S → y_63=2\n\nT=63: D → y_64=1\n\nT=64: S → y_65=1\n\nT=65: S → y_66=1\n\nThen same as before, but we stayed at T=62, so y_63=2, which is fine, but we delayed the down move.\n\nThen go up same.\n\nBut in this case, actions: T=62: S, T=63: D, T=64: S, T=65: S, then T=66: U, etc., same number of actions to reach y=9.\n\nFor example, from above, at T=65: S, y_66=1, same as before.\n\nThen same up sequence.\n\nSo no saving.\n\nPerhaps during go up, we can stay to avoid row 7 and 8 at bad times, but since we are below, no need.\n\nIn fact, in our sequence, we pass row 7 at T=72, which is fine.\n\nBut row 7 occupied only at T=68,69, so at T=72 it is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, but we have row 1 occupied at T=76,77,78,79, but since we reach y=9 at T=74, before that, no issue.\n\nAt T=74, y=9, safe.\n\nNow, H=12.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach in fewer turns.\n\nSuppose we do not go down; is there a way to be at y=7 at T=66? No.\n\nOr, at T=67, for example.\n\nT=67 is t=5 relative.\n\nAt T=67, rows: row 2 at t=5, freeway 2, tail_pos=-59+12*5= -59+60=1, head_pos=-48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly all rows 2-6 safe at T=67 and after, except row 1 later.\n\nRow 7 at T=67, t=5, tail_pos=-47+30= -17? Freeway 7 first car: τ=-47, s=6, t=5, tail_pos=-47+30= -17, head_pos=-36+30= -6, [-17,-6], 0 not in. Safe.\n\nSo at T=67, all rows safe.\n\nIf we can reach y=9 by T=67 or earlier.\n\nFrom y=2 at T=62, to y=9 at T=67.\n\nThat would require y_67=9.\n\ny_67 = y_62 + Δy_62 + Δy_63 + Δy_64 + Δy_65 + Δy_66? y_67 = y_66 + Δy_66, but y_66 <= 2+4=6, so y_67 <=7, not 9.\n\nImpossible.\n\nSimilarly, T=68: y_68 <= y_62 +6 =8, not 9.\n\nT=69: y_69 <=9, possible if all up.\n\ny_62=2, after 7 up moves, y_{69}=9.\n\nT=69 = 62 +7, so after 7 actions, y_69=9.\n\nBut at T=66, we need to be safe.\n\nIf we go all up from start:\n\nT=62: U → y_63=3\n\nT=63: U → y_64=4\n\nT=64: U → y_65=5\n\nT=65: U → y_66=6\n\nBut at T=66, y=6, occupied! Collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf we go up but avoid T=66 on row 6.\n\nBut at T=66, if we are on row 6, occupied.\n\nTo not be on row 6 at T=66, we need to be lower or higher, but higher not possible.\n\nSo must be lower at T=66.\n\nThus, cannot reach by T=69.\n\nEarliest possible: since we must spend some turns to go down, then up.\n\nMinimal H: we need at least 7 up moves to increase from 2 to 9, but we have one down move, so net +6, but we need +7, so at least 8 actions? Let's think.\n\nStart y=2, end y=9, need +7.\n\nEach up move +1, down move -1, stay 0.\n\nIn the path, we have one down move (to go to y=1), so the net from moves is +6 for y, but we start at 2, end at 9, +7, so we need one more up move.\n\nIn terms of actions, the sum of Δy must be +7.\n\nIn the sequence, we have actions: four actions to get to y_66=1, which include one down and three stays, so sum Δy for first four: -1 +0+0+0 = -1.\n\nThen from T=66 to T=73, eight actions: all up, sum +8.\n\ny_66=1, after 8 up, y_74=9.\n\nSum Δy total: for first 4: -1, next 8: +8, total +7, yes.\n\nBut number of actions 12.\n\nIf we can have fewer actions with sum Δy +7.\n\nFor example, if we go directly up but avoid the collision at T=66 by not being there.\n\nBut as before, not possible.\n\nSuppose we go down to y=1 at T=63, then go up, but we have to be at y=0 or 1 at T=66.\n\nIf at T=63, y=1, and we go up at T=63: U to y_64=2\n\nThen at T=64, y=2, safe.\n\nT=64: U to y_65=3\n\nT=65: now at T=65, y=3, we need y_66 not 2-6, so must go down to y_66=2 or less, but y=2 occupied, so to y=1 or 0.\n\nAction D: y_66=2, but occupied.\n\nAction S: y_66=3, occupied.\n\nAction U: y_66=4, occupied.\n\nAll bad.\n\nSo only if we stay at low y until T=66.\n\nThus, minimal H is 12.\n\nBut let's confirm with the row 7 and 8.\n\nIn the sequence, at T=68, y=3, not row 7.\n\nAt T=69, y=4, not row 7 or 8.\n\nThen we reach row 7 at T=72, safe.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster after T=66.\n\nFor example, from y=1 at T=66, we can do multiple up, but we can only do one per turn.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think 12 is minimal.\n\nBut let's see the answer format.\n\nWe need to output the actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have T=62 to T=73 actions.\n\nThe player starts at t_1=62, position (0,2).\n\nWe need sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1 relative to t_1? Or absolute.\n\nIn the answer, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo absolute turns.\n\nNow, but in the car state, we have row 6 has two cars, but we used only one, and it was fine.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nNow, another thing: at the beginning, when we go down to y=1, row 1 is freeway, but at that time, it is safe until T=76.\n\nIn our sequence, we are on row 1 from T=63 to T=66, all safe.\n\nThen we leave.\n\nNow, to write the sequence.\n\nH=12, actions from T=62 to T=73.\n\nList:\n\nTurn 62: D\n\nTurn 63: S\n\nTurn 64: S\n\nTurn 65: S\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: U\n\nTurn 68: U\n\nTurn 69: U\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nTurn 73: U\n\nThen at turn 74, y=9.\n\nThe actions are up to turn 73, and after that, at turn 74, we are at y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, we have 12 actions, from t=0 to 11 relative.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be the actions to take.\n\nPerhaps we can have a shorter sequence if we go to y=0, but no.\n\nAnother idea: since row 7 and 8 are occupied at T=68,69, and we are below, but if we can be on row 8 or 9 at that time, safe.\n\nBut from low y, not possible.\n\nSuppose at T=66, we are at y=1, but we go up faster? No.\n\nI think 12 is the best.\n\nBut let's calculate the turns.\n\nStart T=62, y=2.\n\nAfter action D at T=62, at T=63 y=1.\n\nThen S at T=63, T=64 y=1.\n\nS at T=64, T=65 y=1.\n\nS at T=65, T=66 y=1.\n\nU at T=66, T=67 y=2.\n\nU at T=67, T=68 y=3.\n\nU at T=68, T=69 y=4.\n\nU at T=69, T=70 y=5.\n\nU at T=70, T=71 y=6.\n\nU at T=71, T=72 y=7.\n\nU at T=72, T=73 y=8.\n\nU at T=73, T=74 y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nTo save one action, if at some point we can skip, but no.\n\nPerhaps we don't need to stay at y=1; we can go to y=1 at T=63, then at T=63 go up to y=2, but then at T=64, we are at y=2, then we need to go down later to avoid T=66, but it adds actions.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nThe sequence is for turns from 62 to 73.\n\nBut H=12, sequence of 12 actions.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's write it.\n</think>\nTo reach the goal position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 62\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 12. The sequence of actions ensures that the player is not on a row where \\(x = 0\\) is occupied by a car at any turn, considering the car movements and collision rules.\n\n### Key Constraints and Solution:\n- **Initial State**: Player at (0, 2) at turn 62.\n- **Goal**: Reach (0, 9) as quickly as possible.\n- **Car Occupancy at \\(x = 0\\)**:\n  - Rows 2 to 6 are occupied only at turn 66 (relative time \\(t = 4\\).\n  - Rows 7 and 8 are occupied at turns 68 and 69 (relative times \\(t = 6\\) and \\(t = 7\\)).\n  - Row 1 is occupied at turns 76 to 79, but this is avoided by reaching the goal earlier.\n- **Strategy**:\n  - To avoid the occupancy of rows 2-6 at turn 66, the player must be at row 0 or 1 at turn 66. Row 1 is chosen as it is closer to the goal.\n  - From turn 62, move down to row 1 by turn 63 and stay there until turn 66 to satisfy the constraint at turn 66.\n  - From turn 66, move up continuously to reach row 9 by turn 74, avoiding rows 7 and 8 during their occupancy at turns 68 and 69 by being on lower rows (y=3 and y=4) at those times.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions for turns 62 to 73 (12 actions) results in the player reaching (0, 9) at turn 74. Each action is chosen to avoid collisions:\n- At turn 66, being on row 1 avoids the occupancy of rows 2-6.\n- At turns 68 and 69, being on rows 3 and 4 avoids the occupancy of rows 7 and 8.\n\nThe actions are:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 62: D \\\\\nTurn 63: S \\\\\nTurn 64: S \\\\\nTurn 65: S \\\\\nTurn 66: U \\\\\nTurn 67: U \\\\\nTurn 68: U \\\\\nTurn 69: U \\\\\nTurn 70: U \\\\\nTurn 71: U \\\\\nTurn 72: U \\\\\nTurn 73: U\n}\n\n### Verification:\n- **Turn 62 (t=0)**: Action D, move to y=1 at turn 63. Position at turn 63: (0,1) – safe (row 1 not occupied).\n- **Turn 63 (t=1)**: Action S, stay at y=1. Position at turn 64: (0,1) – safe.\n- **Turn 64 (t=2)**: Action S, stay at y=1. Position at turn 65: (0,1) – safe.\n- **Turn 65 (t=3)**: Action S, stay at y=1. Position at turn 66: (0,1) – safe (row 1 not occupied at t=4).\n- **Turn 66 (t=4)**: Action U, move to y=2 at turn 67. Position at turn 67: (0,2) – safe (row 2 not occupied except at t=4, which is past).\n- **Turn 67 (t=5)**: Action U, move to y=3 at turn 68. Position at turn 68: (0,3) – safe (row 3 safe; rows 7-8 occupied but player not on them).\n- **Turn 68 (t=6)**: Action U, move to y=4 at turn 69. Position at turn 69: (0,4) – safe (row 4 safe; rows 7-8 occupied but player not on them).\n- **Turn 69 (t=7)**: Action U, move to y=5 at turn 70. Position at turn 70: (0,5) – safe.\n- **Turn 70 (t=8)**: Action U, move to y=6 at turn 71. Position at turn 71: (0,6) – safe.\n- **Turn 71 (t=9)**: Action U, move to y=7 at turn 72. Position at turn 72: (0,7) – safe (row 7 occupied only at t=6,7; t=9 safe).\n- **Turn 72 (t=10)**: Action U, move to y=8 at turn 73. Position at turn 73: (0,8) – safe (row 8 occupied only at t=6,7; t=10 safe).\n- **Turn 73 (t=11)**: Action U, move to y=9 at turn 74. Goal reached at turn 74.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in minimal turns (H=12) by efficiently handling the constraints at turns 66, 68, and 69.",

The current turn is t_1 = 66, and I start at y=0.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. Each car has a head, tail, direction, and speed. The span changes over time based on the direction and speed.\n\nFor left-moving cars, the span moves left as time increases, and for right-moving cars, it moves right.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, when I'm on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. The note says that if I move to a different y at turn T, I'm not on that new y until the next turn, so I only care about the freeway I'm currently on at each turn.\n\nI start at turn t_1 = 66, position (0,0). I need to reach (0,9).\n\nActions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), S (stay, y same). y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, I think, since cars are only on y=1 to 8? The problem says \"freeways y=1,…,8\", so probably y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so no collision possible there. That makes sense; the start and end might be safe zones.\n\nSo at y=0, I'm safe, and at y=9, I'm safe. But I need to pass through y=1 to 8, and avoid collisions there.\n\nNow, let's list all the cars and their positions at turn t_1=66.\n\nFreeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nDirection is right, so it's moving right. Head is -48, tail is -59? That seems odd. Usually head is the front, so for right-moving, head should be greater than tail, I think.\n\nLet's read the span update.\n\nFor right-moving: span at t_1 is [τ, h], and at time T, it becomes [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor freeway 1: (h, τ, d, s) = (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nBut for right-moving, the span should be [τ, h] with τ < h? Here h = -48, τ = -59, and -59 < -48, so τ = -59, h = -48, so span at t_1 is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nThen at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-59 + 3(T-66), -48 + 3(T-66)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be different, but all here are right-moving except I need to check.\n\nFreeway 1: right, so [τ, h] = [-59, -48] at t_1=66.\n\nNow, collision if 0 is in the span at the turn when I'm on that freeway.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nh=48, τ=37, but for right-moving, τ should be less than h? 37<48, yes, so span [τ, h] = [37,48] at t_1.\n\nBut direction is right, so moving right.\n\nh=48, τ=37, so front is at 48, back at 37, moving right, so span [37,48] at t_1.\n\nAt time T, [37 + 12(T-66), 48 + 12(T-66)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? (48,37,right,12) identical to freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: same (48,37,right,12)\n\nFreeway 5: same (48,37,right,12)\n\nFreeway 6: two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst car: same as above, (48,37,right,12) span [37,48] at t_1\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12) h=0, τ=-11, so for right-moving, span [τ,h] = [-11,0] at t_1\n\nAt T, [-11 +12(T-66), 0 +12(T-66)] = [12(T-66)-11, 12(T-66)]\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,6) span [τ,h] = [-59,-48] at t_1\n\nAt T, [-59 +6(T-66), -48 +6(T-66)]\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,6) span [-11,0] at t_1\n\nAt T, [-11 +6(T-66), 0 +6(T-66)] = [6(T-66)-11, 6(T-66)]\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nNow, I need to find a path from y=0 to y=9, starting at turn 66, position (0,0), and at each turn, when I'm on a y between 1 and 8, 0 should not be in any car span on that freeway at that turn.\n\nSince I start at y=0, turn 66, and I need to end at y=9, and H is the number of turns, including the starting turn? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1, with t starting from t_1, I think.\n\n\"sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so t from 0 to H-1, so actions at turns t_1 + 0 to t_1 + (H-1)\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H - 1, we have y = 9? Let's see.\n\nPlayer position: at turn T, position is y_T.\n\nAfter action at turn T, we go to y_{T+1}.\n\nStart at turn t_1, y_{t_1} = 0.\n\nAction a_{t_1} determines y_{t_1 +1}? No.\n\nThe update is: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, we apply action a_t, then move to y_{t+1}.\n\nThe state at turn t is y_t.\n\nAt turn t, position is (0, y_t).\n\nThen we choose action a_t, which changes y to y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t, and we choose a_t to go to y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision is checked at turn T based on y_T and the car spans at T.\n\nIf y_T = k for some k in 1-8, and for that freeway, 0 in some car span at T, then collision.\n\nNow, we start at turn t_1 = 66, y_{66} = 0.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, y_{t_1 + H} should be 9? Let's see the goal: \"reach (0,9)\" and \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nThe sequence is actions from t=0 to H-1, so actions at t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1.\n\nAfter action at t_1+H-1, we have y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut the position at turn t_1 + H - 1 is y_{t_1 + H - 1}, and after action a_{t_1 + H - 1}, we go to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nThe goal is to have y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\n\"reach (0,9)\" and \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nSo at turn t_1 + H - 1, we are at y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, we can be there.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, so H actions over H turns? Turns: turn t_1, t_1+1, ..., up to turn t_1 + H - 1, which is H turns.\n\nAction at turn t affects y_{t+1}.\n\nStart: turn t_1, y_{t_1} = 0.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, we go to y_{t_1 +1}.\n\nSimilarly, after a_{t_1 + k}, we go to y_{t_1 + k +1}.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H - 1, after action a_{t_1 + H - 1}, we go to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9, which means at turn t_1 + H - 1, we are at position 9, before taking any action or after? At the beginning of turn t_1 + H - 1, we are at y_{t_1 + H - 1}, then we choose action a_{t_1 + H - 1} to go to y_{t_1 + H}, but since we want to be at 9 at that turn, we must have y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9, and then we can choose to stay or whatever, but the goal is to reach 9, so once we are at 9, we can stop or stay, but since we specify the action sequence until we reach, I think H is such that at turn t_1 + H - 1, we are at 9.\n\nFor example, if I start at y=0, to reach y=9, minimum H is at least 9, if I go up each turn.\n\nBut I might go down sometimes to avoid cars, but that would increase H, so probably not, since we want minimal H.\n\nIn this case, I need to go from 0 to 9, so minimum 9 actions if I go up every turn, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars.\n\nFirst, let's see if going straight up is possible.\n\nI start at turn 66, y=0.\n\nI need to be at y=1 at some turn, but when I go to y=1, I must not collide with cars on y=1 at that turn.\n\nSimilarly for each y.\n\nLet me denote T as the turn number from t_1=66, so let τ = T - 66, so τ=0 at current turn.\n\nThen at time τ, turn T = 66 + τ.\n\nCar spans at turn 66 + τ.\n\nFor each freeway, I need when I am on that freeway at turn 66+τ, 0 not in any car span on that row at that turn.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, when 0 is not in the car spans, i.e., safe to be at that y at that time.\n\nSince I move one step per turn, I need to plan the times when I arrive at each y.\n\nBut I can only change y by -1,0,1 each turn, so the time to go from y=0 to y=9 is at least 9 turns, and at most, well, more if I wait.\n\nBut since we want minimal H, probably H=9 is possible, or if not, then 10, etc.\n\nFirst, let's see the car positions over time.\n\nLet τ = T - 66, so τ >=0.\n\nFor freeway 1: cars: one car, right-moving, span at τ: [ -59 + 3τ, -48 + 3τ ]  (since s=3)\n\n0 in span if -59 + 3τ <= 0 <= -48 + 3τ\n\nThat is, -59 + 3τ <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 3τ\n\nSo 3τ <= 59 and 48 <= 3τ? Let's solve inequalities.\n\n-59 + 3τ <= 0 => 3τ <= 59 => τ <= 59/3 = 19.666, so τ <= 19 since integer? τ is turn offset, integer.\n\nT is turn, integer, so τ integer.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= -48 + 3τ => 48 <= 3τ => τ >= 16.\n\nSo 16 <= τ <= 19.\n\nτ >= ceil(48/3) = 16, and τ <= floor(59/3) = 19? 59/3=19.666, floor 19.\n\n3τ <=59, τ<=19, and 3τ >=48, τ>=16.\n\nYes, so for τ from 16 to 19 inclusive, 0 is in the span on freeway 1.\n\nSo unsafe at τ=16,17,18,19.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nNow freeway 2: one car (48,37,right,12), span at τ: [37 + 12τ, 48 + 12τ]\n\n0 in span if 37+12τ <=0 <=48+12τ\n\nBut 37+12τ <=0? 12τ <= -37, impossible since τ>=0, 12τ>=0, 37+12τ>=37>0, so 37+12τ >0, thus 0 < 37+12τ <=0 is false, so never 0 in span. Similarly, 48+12τ>0, so 0 cannot be <=48+12τ and >=37+12τ since both positive. So always safe on freeway 2? 37+12τ >0 for all τ>=0, so the span is always to the right of 0, so 0 not in span, yes, safe at all times.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, one car (48,37,right,12), same as above, always safe.\n\nFreeway 4: same, always safe.\n\nFreeway 5: same, always safe.\n\nFreeway 6: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12), same as above, span [37+12τ,48+12τ], always positive, so 0 not in span.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12), span at τ: [-11 +12τ, 0 +12τ] = [12τ -11, 12τ]\n\n0 in span if 12τ -11 <= 0 <= 12τ\n\nWhich is always true for τ=0? Let's see.\n\n12τ -11 <=0 <=12τ\n\n0 <=12τ always for τ>=0.\n\n12τ -11 <=0 => 12τ <=11 => τ <= 11/12 <1, so τ=0 only? τ integer, τ=0: 12*0 -11 = -11 <=0 <=0? 0 <=0 is true, and -11<=0 true, so at τ=0, 0 in span.\n\nτ=0: span [12*0 -11, 12*0] = [-11, 0], and 0 is included, yes.\n\nFor τ>=1, 12τ -11 >=12*1 -11=1>0, so span [12τ-11, 12τ] both positive, so 0 not in since 0 < 12τ-11 <= x <=12τ.\n\nSo only at τ=0, 0 is in the span for second car on freeway 6.\n\nAt other times, not.\n\nBut there is also the first car, but it never has 0 in span.\n\nSo for freeway 6, unsafe only at τ=0.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,6), span at τ: [-59 +6τ, -48 +6τ]\n\n0 in span if -59+6τ <=0 <= -48+6τ\n\nSo -59+6τ <=0 => 6τ <=59 => τ <= 59/6=9.833, τ<=9\n\nAnd 0 <= -48+6τ => 48 <=6τ => τ >=8\n\nSo τ from 8 to 9 inclusive.\n\nτ>= ceil(48/6)=8, τ<= floor(59/6)=9? 59/6=9.833, floor 9.\n\n6τ <=59, τ<=9, 6τ >=48, τ>=8.\n\nYes, τ=8,9.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,6), span at τ: [-11 +6τ, 0 +6τ] = [6τ-11, 6τ]\n\n0 in span if 6τ-11 <=0 <=6τ\n\n0 <=6τ always for τ>=0.\n\n6τ-11 <=0 => 6τ <=11 => τ <= 11/6≈1.833, so τ<=1.\n\nFor τ=0: [ -11, 0], 0 in.\n\nτ=1: [6*1-11, 6] = [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nτ=2: [12-11,12]=[1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for second car, unsafe at τ=0 and τ=1.\n\nNow for freeway 7, unsafe if either car has 0 in span.\n\nFirst car unsafe at τ=8,9\n\nSecond car unsafe at τ=0,1\n\nSo overall, freeway 7 unsafe at τ=0,1,8,9\n\nSafe otherwise.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same as freeway 7, since same cars: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nSo unsafe at τ=0,1,8,9\n\nNow freeway 1 unsafe at τ=16,17,18,19\n\nFreeway 2,3,4,5 always safe? Freeway 2,3,4,5 each have one car (48,37,right,12), which is always to the right, so safe.\n\nBut freeway 6 unsafe at τ=0 only.\n\nI need to be at each y from 1 to 8 at some time without collision.\n\nSince I start at y=0 at τ=0, and I need to reach y=9.\n\nLet me list the unsafe times for each row:\n\ny=1: freeway 1, unsafe τ=16,17,18,19\n\ny=2: freeway 2, always safe\n\ny=3: freeway 3, always safe\n\ny=4: freeway 4, always safe\n\ny=5: freeway 5, always safe\n\ny=6: freeway 6, unsafe at τ=0\n\ny=7: freeway 7, unsafe at τ=0,1,8,9\n\ny=8: freeway 8, unsafe at τ=0,1,8,9\n\nI start at τ=0, y=0.\n\nAt τ=0, I am at y=0, which is safe.\n\nI need to move to higher y.\n\nIf I go up at τ=0 to y=1, but at τ=0, when I am on y=1? At turn τ=0 (T=66), I am at y=0.\n\nI choose action a_{66}, which determines y_{67}.\n\nAfter action at turn 66, I go to y_{67}.\n\nPosition at turn 66: y=0\n\nChoose a_{66}: if U, then y_{67} = 0 +1 =1\n\nIf S, y_{67}=0\n\nIf D, y_{67}= -1? But y must be in 0-9, so probably D not possible at y=0, or y_{t+1} = max(0, min(9, y_t + Δy)), but the problem says y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so at y=0, D would make y=0, I think, since it can't go below.\n\nSimilarly at y=9, U might not go above.\n\nBut in the action, Δy: U: +1, D: -1, S:0, so if at y=0, D would try to go to -1, but y must be 0-9, so probably y_{t+1} = clamp(y_t + Δy_t, 0,9), so at y=0, D: y_{t+1} = max(0, min(9, -1)) = max(0,-1)=0? min(9,-1) is -1, then max(0,-1)=0.\n\nSimilarly, U at y=9: min(9,10)=9.\n\nSo effectively, at boundaries, D or U might keep you there if you try to go out.\n\nBut for safety, at y=0 and y=9, no cars, so always safe.\n\nBack to path.\n\nAt τ=0, turn 66, y=0, safe.\n\nI choose action: if I choose U, then y_{67} =1, so at turn 67, I am at y=1.\n\nNow, turn 67 corresponds to τ=1, since τ = T - 66, so T=67, τ=1.\n\nSimilarly, if I choose S at τ=0, y_{67}=0, still at y=0 at turn 67, τ=1.\n\nNow, for y=1, freeway 1, unsafe at τ=16,17,18,19.\n\nAt τ=1, is it safe? τ=1 not in 16-19, so safe at τ=1 for y=1.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 unsafe only at τ=0.\n\nBut at τ=0, I am at y=0, not on y=6.\n\nWhen I am on y=6, it must not be at τ=0.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nI want to go up as fast as possible, so let's see if I can go up every turn.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=0.\n\nAfter action U at turn 66 (τ=0), go to y=1 at turn 67 (τ=1)\n\nAt τ=1, y=1: freeway 1 safe? τ=1 not in 16-19, yes safe.\n\nThen at turn 67 (τ=1), choose U, go to y=2 at turn 68 (τ=2)\n\ny=2: freeway 2, always safe.\n\nAt turn 68 (τ=2), U to y=3 at turn 69 (τ=3)\n\ny=3: freeway 3, safe.\n\nU to y=4 at turn 70 (τ=4)\n\ny=4: safe.\n\nU to y=5 at turn 71 (τ=5)\n\ny=5: safe.\n\nNow, from y=5, I need to go to y=6.\n\nAt turn 71 (τ=5), I am at y=5.\n\nChoose U, go to y=6 at turn 72 (τ=6)\n\nNow, at turn 72 (τ=6), I am on y=6.\n\ny=6 unsafe only at τ=0.\n\nτ=6 ≠0, so safe.\n\nThen U to y=7 at turn 73 (τ=7)\n\ny=7: freeway 7, unsafe at τ=0,1,8,9.\n\nτ=7 not in {0,1,8,9}, so safe? τ=7, yes, 7 not in that set.\n\nThen U to y=8 at turn 74 (τ=8)\n\nNow, at turn 74 (τ=8), y=8.\n\ny=8: freeway 8, unsafe at τ=0,1,8,9.\n\nτ=8 is unsafe!\n\nOh, problem.\n\nAt τ=8, y=8 is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=7 at τ=7, safe, but then to y=8 at τ=8, unsafe.\n\nFrom y=8, U to y=9 at turn 75 (τ=9)\n\nBut at τ=9, y=8 is also unsafe? First, at τ=8, when I arrive at y=8, it is unsafe.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAfter U at turn 73 (τ=7) from y=7 to y=8 at turn 74 (τ=8)\n\nAt turn 74, I am at y=8, and τ=8, which is unsafe for y=8.\n\nSo collision.\n\nCannot go directly to y=8 at τ=8.\n\nSimilarly, if I delay.\n\nBut I want minimal H, so H=9 turns: from τ=0 to τ=8, actions at turns 66 to 74, and at turn 74, y should be 9? Let's see the turns.\n\nStart: turn 66, τ=0, y=0\n\nAfter a_{66}, go to y_{67}\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{74}, go to y_{75}\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H - 1} = y_{66 + H - 1} =9\n\nFor H=9, y_{66+8} =9? t_1 + H -1 =66 +9 -1=74, so y_{74} =9.\n\nAt turn 74, position y=9.\n\nIn the path above, if I go up every turn:\n\nAfter a_{66} U: y_{67}=1\n\na_{67} U: y_{68}=2\n\n...\n\na_{73} U: y_{74}=8? Let's list:\n\nTurn 66: a_{66}, after, y_{67} = y_{66} + Δy_{66}\n\nAt turn 66, y_{66}=0\n\na_{66} U: Δy= +1, so y_{67}=1\n\nTurn 67: y_{67}=1, a_{67} U: y_{68}=2\n\nTurn 68: y_{68}=2, a_{68} U: y_{69}=3\n\nTurn 69: y_{69}=3, a_{69} U: y_{70}=4\n\nTurn 70: y_{70}=4, a_{70} U: y_{71}=5\n\nTurn 71: y_{71}=5, a_{71} U: y_{72}=6\n\nTurn 72: y_{72}=6, a_{72} U: y_{73}=7\n\nTurn 73: y_{73}=7, a_{73} U: y_{74}=8\n\nTurn 74: y_{74}=8, a_{74} U: y_{75}=9\n\nBut we want y_{74}=9? Here at turn 74, y=8, not 9.\n\ny_{74}=8, then after a_{74} U, y_{75}=9.\n\nBut the goal is y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{74} for H=9? t_1 + H -1 =66 +9 -1=74, so y_{74} should be 9.\n\nBut in this sequence, y_{74}=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y_{74}=9, I need to be at y=9 at turn 74.\n\nSo I need to arrive earlier.\n\nFor example, start at turn 66, y=0.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn 74, I need to have moved up 9 times in 8 actions? From turn 66 to turn 74, that's 9 turns: 66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74.\n\nAt turn 66: y=0\n\nAfter 0 actions, y=0\n\nAfter 1 action (at turn 66), y_{67} =1 if U\n\nAfter 2 actions (turn 66,67), y_{68} =2 if both U\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, y_{66+k}\n\nAt turn T, after actions from 66 to T-1, we have y_T.\n\nSpecifically, at turn 66, y_{66} =0 (initial)\n\nAfter action a_{66}, y_{67} set\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{73}, y_{74} set\n\nAfter action a_{74}, y_{75} set\n\nWe want y_{74} =9.\n\nThat means at turn 74, position is 9.\n\nTo have y_{74}=9, starting from y_{66}=0, I need to increase y by 9 in the actions from turn 66 to 73.\n\nActions a_{66} to a_{73} determine y_{67} to y_{74}.\n\ny_{67} = y_{66} + Δy_{66}\n\ny_{68} = y_{67} + Δy_{67} = y_{66} + Δy_{66} + Δy_{67}\n\n...\n\ny_{74} = y_{66} + sum_{t=66}^{73} Δy_t\n\nSince y_{66}=0, y_{74} = sum_{t=66}^{73} Δy_t\n\nEach Δy_t is -1,0,1, so to have y_{74}=9, sum_{t=66}^{73} Δy_t =9\n\nThere are 8 actions: from t=66 to 73 inclusive? t from 66 to 73, that's 8 terms: 66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73.\n\nt=66 to 73 is 8 actions.\n\ny_{74} = sum_{k=0}^{7} Δy_{66+k}  since from t=66 to 73, 8 terms.\n\nTo have y_{74}=9, the sum of 8 Δy must be 9, each |Δy|<=1, so maximum sum is 8, if all +1.\n\n8*1=8<9, impossible to reach y=9 in 8 actions from y=0.\n\ny_{66}=0, after 8 actions (a66 to a73), we have y_{74}, which can be at most 8, if all U.\n\nThen y_{74}=8, then at turn 74, we can choose a_{74} to go to y_{75}=9.\n\nBut y_{74}=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y_{74}=9, we need to be at y=9 at turn 74, which requires that we reached earlier.\n\nFor example, if we start at y=0 turn 66, after 9 actions we can be at y=9 at turn 75.\n\ny_{75} = sum_{t=66}^{74} Δy_t, with 9 terms, can be 9.\n\nThen at turn t_1 + H -1 =66 + H -1, we want this to be 75 for y=9.\n\nSo 66 + H -1 =75 => H-1=9, H=10.\n\nSimilarly, minimal H is at least 9, but with 9 actions, we can be at y=9 at turn 75.\n\nFor H=9, y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{66+8} = y_{74}, which can be at most 8, so cannot be 9. So minimal H must be at least 10.\n\ny_{74} <= y_{66} + 8 =8, since each action changes by at most 1.\n\nSo y_{74} <=8, cannot be 9.\n\nThus, the earliest to be at y=9 is turn 75, with y_{75}=9, which requires H such that t_1 + H -1 =75, so 66 + H -1 =75, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nThen y_{74} must be 8 or 9, but if y_{74}=9, then no action needed at turn 74? But we have to specify actions until we reach.\n\nIn the sequence, for H=10, actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1 =66 to 75? t from 0 to H-1, so actions at t_1 +0 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nFor H=10, actions at 66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75? t_1 + t for t=0 to 9, so turns 66 to 75.\n\nBut after a_{75}, y_{76} is set, but we only care up to y_{75}=9.\n\nThe position at turn t_1 + H -1 =66+10-1=75, y_{75}=9.\n\nIn the action sequence, a_{75} is the last action, which could be S or something, but since we are at y=9, we can stay or whatever.\n\nBut the position at turn 75 is y_{75}, which is after the action? At turn T, before action, we are at y_T, then we choose a_T to set y_{T+1}.\n\nBut for collision, at turn T, we are at y_T, and we check collision based on y_T.\n\nThen we choose a_T to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nFor the goal, at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at y=9.\n\nIn the sequence for H=10, turn t_1 + H -1 =75, y_{75}=9.\n\nTo achieve that, with actions from 66 to 75? Actions at 66 to 75, that's 10 actions.\n\na_{66} to a_{75}, which set y_{67} to y_{76}.\n\nBut we want y_{75}=9.\n\ny_{75} is determined by actions from 66 to 74.\n\ny_{75} = y_{66} + sum_{t=66}^{74} Δy_t\n\n9 terms from t=66 to 74 inclusive.\n\nt=66 to 74 is 9 actions: 66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74.\n\nThen y_{75} = sum_{k=0}^{8} Δy_{66+k}  for k=0 to 8.\n\nThen to have y_{75}=9, need all Δy= +1 for these 9 actions.\n\nThen y_{75}=9.\n\nThen at turn 75, we are at y=9, and we need to include a_{75}, but since we are already at 9, we can do S or U, but U would go to 10, not allowed, so probably S.\n\nBut the action at turn 75 is part of the sequence, but since we reach at turn 75, y_{75}=9, and a_{75} can be S to stay at 9 for y_{76}, but we don't care about later.\n\nNow for collision, in this path, going up every turn from turn 66 to 74 with U, so y_{67}=1, y_{68}=2, ..., y_{75}=9.\n\nNow the times when we are on each y:\n\nAt turn 67 (τ=1), y=1\n\nTurn 68 (τ=2), y=2\n\nTurn 69 (τ=3), y=3\n\nTurn 70 (τ=4), y=4\n\nTurn 71 (τ=5), y=5\n\nTurn 72 (τ=6), y=6\n\nTurn 73 (τ=7), y=7\n\nTurn 74 (τ=8), y=8\n\nThen turn 75 (τ=9), y=9\n\nNow check collision:\n\ny=1 at τ=1: safe, as before\n\ny=2 at τ=2: safe\n\ny=3 at τ=3: safe\n\ny=4 at τ=4: safe\n\ny=5 at τ=5: safe\n\ny=6 at τ=6: safe, since unsafe only at τ=0\n\ny=7 at τ=7: freeway 7 unsafe at τ=0,1,8,9; τ=7 not in, so safe\n\ny=8 at τ=8: freeway 8 unsafe at τ=0,1,8,9; τ=8 is unsafe!\n\nAt turn 74 (τ=8), y=8, which is unsafe for freeway 8.\n\nCollision.\n\nCannot be on y=8 at τ=8.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 at τ=9 is safe.\n\nBut the problem is at y=8, τ=8.\n\nTo avoid, I need not to be on y=8 at τ=8 or on y=7 at τ=8 or something.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 both unsafe at τ=8 and τ=9.\n\nI need to adjust the timing.\n\nI could go slower or faster in some parts.\n\nSince y=2,3,4,5 are always safe, I can stay there if needed.\n\nBut to minimize H, I should avoid waiting if possible.\n\nH=10 might be minimal, but with this path, collision at y=8, τ=8.\n\nI could arrive at y=8 at a different time.\n\nFor example, if I start by waiting at y=0 for some turns, but y=0 is safe, but that increases H.\n\nSimilarly, I could go down, but that also increases H.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 are unsafe at τ=8 and τ=9, I need to be on them at other times.\n\ny=7 unsafe τ=0,1,8,9\n\ny=8 unsafe τ=0,1,8,9\n\nSafe for y=7 at τ=2,3,4,5,6,7? τ=7 is 7, not in 0,1,8,9, so safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8 safe at τ=2,3,4,5,6,7.\n\nτ=7 is safe for both.\n\nIn the direct path, I am at y=7 at τ=7 (turn 73), which is safe.\n\nThen I go to y=8 at τ=8 (turn 74), unsafe.\n\nIf I could stay at y=7 for one more turn, then go to y=8 at τ=9, but τ=9 is also unsafe for y=8.\n\ny=8 unsafe at τ=8 and τ=9.\n\nIf I go to y=8 at τ=7 or earlier, or later.\n\nτ=7 is safe for y=8? Yes.\n\nIn the sequence, I am at y=7 at τ=7 (turn 73).\n\nIf instead of going up to y=8 at turn 73, I stay at y=7 for one turn.\n\nBut at turn 73, y=7, if I choose S, then y_{74}=7, so at turn 74 (τ=8), I am at y=7.\n\ny=7 at τ=8: unsafe, because freeway 7 unsafe at τ=8.\n\nτ=8 is unsafe for y=7.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down, but that might not help.\n\nLet's list the safe τ for each critical row.\n\ny=1: unsafe τ=16-19, but I will be there early, not issue.\n\ny=6: unsafe only τ=0, not issue.\n\ny=7: unsafe τ=0,1,8,9\n\nSafe τ=2,3,4,5,6,7\n\ny=8: unsafe τ=0,1,8,9\n\nSafe τ=2,3,4,5,6,7\n\nI need to be on y=7 at some safe τ, and on y=8 at some safe τ.\n\nSince I go from y=6 to y=7 to y=8, I need to be on y=7 at time τ_a, then on y=8 at τ_b = τ_a +1, since I move one per turn, unless I stay or something.\n\nThe time I spend on each row.\n\nWhen I move from y to y+1, I am on y for one turn, then move to y+1.\n\nFor example, to go from y=6 to y=7: I am on y=6 at some turn, then choose U, so next turn on y=7.\n\nSimilarly from y=7 to y=8.\n\nIn the path, I need to choose when to be on y=6, y=7, y=8.\n\ny=6 is only unsafe at τ=0, which is early, so I can be on y=6 at any τ except 0, but since I start from below, τ>= some, not issue.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 and y=8 have constraints.\n\nLet me define the turn when I am on y=7 as τ7, and on y=8 as τ8.\n\nSince I go from y=6 to y=7, when I am on y=6 at turn T, I choose U, so at turn T+1, I am on y=7.\n\nSimilarly, from y=7 to y=8, at turn S on y=7, choose U, at turn S+1 on y=8.\n\nSo τ8 = τ7 +1, because I move directly.\n\nUnless I stay on some row.\n\nBut to minimize H, I should not stay if not necessary.\n\nIn this case, for y=7 and y=8, I need τ7 safe and τ8 safe, with τ8 = τ7 +1.\n\nBut for y=7, safe τ: 2,3,4,5,6,7\n\nFor y=8, safe τ: 2,3,4,5,6,7\n\nNow, if τ8 = τ7 +1, and both safe, possible only if τ7 <=6, since if τ7=7, τ8=8, but τ8=8 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if τ7=2, τ8=3 both safe.\n\nτ7=3, τ8=4 safe, etc, up to τ7=6, τ8=7 both safe.\n\nτ7=7, τ8=8 not safe because τ8=8 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, τ7=1 not safe for y=7.\n\nSo possible pairs: τ7 from 2 to 6, τ8=τ7+1 from 3 to 7.\n\nAll these are safe.\n\nIn the direct up path, I had τ7=7, τ8=8, but τ8=8 unsafe.\n\nI can have earlier τ7.\n\nFor example, if I am on y=7 at τ=6, then on y=8 at τ=7.\n\nBoth safe.\n\nτ=6 and τ=7 are safe for both y=7 and y=8.\n\ny=7 safe at τ=6 and τ=7.\n\ny=8 safe at τ=6 and τ=7.\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly, I could be later, but since I want minimal H, earlier might be better.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I need to reach y=9 at turn 75 for H=10.\n\ny_{75}=9.\n\nWith actions all U except possibly adjustments.\n\nFrom start, I need to be on y=7 at τ=6 or something.\n\nτ is turn offset from 66.\n\nTurn 66: τ=0, y=0\n\nI need y_{75}=9.\n\nSo I must have 9 up moves in the actions from 66 to 74.\n\nActions a_{66} to a_{74} determine y_{67} to y_{75}.\n\ny_{75} = sum_{t=66}^{74} Δy_t\n\n9 terms, all +1 to have y_{75}=9.\n\nThen at turn 75, y=9, and a_{75} can be S.\n\nNow, the position during:\n\ny_{67} =1 (since first U)\n\ny_{68}=2\n\n...\n\ny_{74}=8?

unsafe.\n\nTo avoid, I need to be on y=8 at a different time.\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=8 at τ=7.\n\nBut in this sequence, at τ=7, I am on y=7.\n\nIf I am on y=7 earlier, say at τ=6, then I can be on y=8 at τ=7.\n\nBut to be on y=7 at τ=6, which is turn 72 (since τ=6, T=72)\n\nThen at turn 72, if y=7, then at turn 72, choose U, to y=8 at turn 73, τ=7.\n\nThen at turn 73, y=8, τ=7, safe.\n\nThen at turn 73, choose U to y=9 at turn 74, τ=8.\n\nBut at turn 74, y=9, τ=8, safe.\n\nThen we need y_{75}=9, but at turn 74, y=9, then at turn 74, we can choose S to keep y=9 for turn 75.\n\nLet's see the timing.\n\nI need to be at y=7 at turn 72 (τ=6)\n\nCurrently, in the sequence, at turn 72, I am at y=6 (τ=6)\n\nI need to be at y=7 at turn 72.\n\nBut to be at y=7 at turn 72, that means at turn 71, I must have been at y=6 or y=7 or y=8, and chosen action to go to y=7 at turn 72.\n\nIf at turn 71, y=6, choose U, then y_{72}=7\n\nIf at turn 71, y=7, choose S, then y_{72}=7\n\nIf at turn 71, y=8, choose D, then y_{72}=7\n\nBut to minimize time, probably from y=6 up.\n\nIn the current path, at turn 71, τ=5, y=5\n\nThen a_{71} U: y_{72}=6\n\nSo at turn 72, y=6\n\nBut I want y=7 at turn 72.\n\nSo I need to be at higher y earlier.\n\nFor example, if at turn 71, I am at y=6, then choose U, y_{72}=7.\n\nBut at turn 71, in the sequence, I am at y=5.\n\nI need to reach y=6 earlier.\n\nSimilarly, I can adjust the earlier actions.\n\nSince y=2,3,4,5 are always safe, I can go faster or slower.\n\nCurrently, I reach y=5 at turn 71, τ=5.\n\nI can reach y=5 earlier.\n\nFor example, start from turn 66, y=0.\n\nIf I go up every turn:\n\nTurn 67: y=1\n\nTurn 68: y=2\n\nTurn 69: y=3\n\nTurn 70: y=4\n\nTurn 71: y=5\n\nTurn 72: y=6\n\nNow, at turn 72, y=6, τ=6\n\nIf I choose U at turn 72, go to y=7 at turn 73, τ=7\n\nBut I want to be at y=7 at turn 72.\n\nAt turn 72, to have y=7, I must have arrived from previous.\n\nFor example, at turn 71, if y=6, choose U, y_{72}=7\n\nOr if y=7, choose S, y_{72}=7, etc.\n\nBut at turn 71, currently y=5.\n\nTo have y=6 at turn 71, for example.\n\nAt turn 71, y=6, then choose U to y=7 at turn 72.\n\nNow, to be at y=6 at turn 71.\n\nTurn 71: τ=5\n\ny=6 at τ=5: safe, since unsafe only τ=0.\n\nNow, from start, to reach y=6 at turn 71.\n\ny_{71} = y_{66} + sum_{t=66}^{70} Δy_t\n\nt=66 to 70, 5 actions.\n\ny_{71} = sum_{k=0}^{4} Δy_{66+k}  for k=0 to 4, 5 terms.\n\nTo have y_{71}=6, since start from 0, need sum of 5 Δy =6, impossible, max 5.\n\ny_{71} <=5.\n\nCannot be at y=6 at turn 71.\n\nSimilarly, y_{70} = sum_{t=66}^{69} Δy_t, 4 terms, max y=4.\n\ny_{69} max 3, etc.\n\nThe earliest to be at y=6 is turn 72: y_{72} = sum_{t=66}^{71} Δy_t, 6 terms, max 6, so possible at turn 72 with all U.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at turn 73 with all U, etc.\n\nSo I cannot be at y=7 before turn 73 with all U.\n\nTurn 73: y_{73} = sum_{t=66}^{72} Δy_t, 7 terms, can be 7.\n\nSimilarly, turn 72: y_{72} can be 6.\n\nNow, for y=7, I can be at turn 73, τ=7, which is safe.\n\nThen I can go to y=8 at turn 74, τ=8, but τ=8 unsafe for y=8.\n\nTo avoid, I need to be on y=8 at τ=7 or earlier.\n\nBut at τ=7, turn 73, I can be on y=7 or y=8.\n\nIf I am on y=7 at τ=7, safe.\n\nIf I can be on y=8 at τ=7, that would be turn 73.\n\ny=8 at turn 73, τ=7, which is safe.\n\nThen from there, go to y=9 at turn 74, τ=8.\n\nBut at turn 74, y=9, safe.\n\nThen y_{75} would be 9 or more, but we need y_{75}=9.\n\nNow, can I be at y=8 at turn 73?\n\ny_{73} = sum_{t=66}^{72} Δy_t, 7 terms, max 7, so y_{73} <=7.\n\nCan be 7, but not 8.\n\ny_{73} <=7, so at turn 73, maximum y=7, cannot be y=8.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be on y=8 before turn 74.\n\nAt turn 74, y_{74} = sum_{t=66}^{73} Δy_t, 8 terms, max 8, so can be 8.\n\nThen at turn 74, y=8, τ=8, which is unsafe for y=8.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 75, y=9.\n\nBut at turn 74, y=8, τ=8, collision.\n\nTo avoid collision at y=8, τ=8, I need not to be on y=8 at τ=8.\n\nSimilarly, I could be on y=7 at τ=8, but y=7 at τ=8 is also unsafe.\n\nThe only way is to be on y=8 at a safe τ, which is τ=2 to 7.\n\nBut I can only be on y=8 at turn 74 or later for H=10, turn 74 is τ=8, which is unsafe, or turn 75 is y=9, not y=8.\n\nWith H=10, I am on y=8 only at turn 74, τ=8, which is unsafe.\n\nI could stay on lower rows longer or shorter.\n\nFor example, if I reach y=6 earlier, but I can't, as above.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=8 later, but that might increase H.\n\nOr, I can stay at y=7 for one turn to avoid being on y=8 at τ=8.\n\nBut at τ=8, y=7 is also unsafe.\n\nLet's see the options.\n\nSuppose at turn 73, I am at y=7, τ=7, safe.\n\nIf I choose to stay, S, then y_{74}=7, so at turn 74, τ=8, y=7.\n\nBut y=7 at τ=8 is unsafe.\n\nIf I choose D, go to y=6 at turn 74, τ=8, y=6 at τ=8: y=6 unsafe only at τ=0, so safe, but then I am at y=6, need to go back up, which takes more turns.\n\nFor example, at turn 74, y=6, then I need to go to y=7, then to y=8, then to y=9, which takes at least 3 more turns, so H larger.\n\nNot good for minimal H.\n\nPerhaps I can time so that I am on y=8 at τ=7.\n\nBut as above, I can be on y=8 at earliest turn 74, τ=8.\n\nTurn 74 is τ=8.\n\nτ=7 is turn 73.\n\nAt turn 73, I can be at y=7 max.\n\nSo impossible to be on y=8 at τ=7.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=6, turn 72, y max 6, so on y=6 or less.\n\nSo the only possible safe times for y=8 are τ=2 to 7, but I can only be on y=8 at τ=8 or later, which are unsafe times for y=8.\n\nτ=8 and τ=9 are unsafe, and τ=10 etc might be safe, but later.\n\nFor example, at τ=10, y=8 would be safe, since unsafe only up to τ=9.\n\ny=8 unsafe at τ=0,1,8,9, so at τ=10, safe.\n\nBut to be on y=8 at τ=10, that means at turn 76, since τ=10, T=76.\n\nThen I need to reach y=9 later, say at turn 77, so H larger.\n\nFor example, H=11 or 12.\n\nBut perhaps not minimal.\n\nSince y=7 is safe at τ=7, I can stay at y=7 for multiple turns to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nBut y=7 is unsafe at τ=8 and τ=9, so I can stay at y=7 only at τ=2 to 7.\n\nAt τ=7, I can be on y=7.\n\nIf I stay at y=7 for one turn, at turn 73, y=7, τ=7, choose S, then at turn 74, y=7, τ=8, but τ=8 unsafe for y=7.\n\nIf I stay at y=7 at τ=6, for example.\n\nBut at τ=6, I can be on y=6 or y=7.\n\nAssume I go up as fast as possible to y=6.\n\nAt turn 72, τ=6, y=6 (if all U so far)\n\nThen at turn 72, choose U to y=7 at turn 73, τ=7.\n\nThen at turn 73, y=7, τ=7, safe.\n\nNow, I cannot stay because at turn 73, if I choose S, y_{74}=7, turn 74 τ=8 unsafe.\n\nIf I choose U, y_{74}=8, turn 74 τ=8 unsafe for y=8.\n\nIf I choose D, y_{74}=6, turn 74 τ=8, y=6 safe, but then I am at y=6, and I need to go to y=7 and y=8 later.\n\nFor example, at turn 74, y=6, τ=8, safe.\n\nThen I can choose U to y=7 at turn 75, τ=9.\n\nBut at turn 75, y=7, τ=9, which is unsafe for y=7.\n\nτ=9 unsafe.\n\nIf I choose to go to y=7 at turn 75, τ=9 unsafe.\n\nOr, I can wait at y=6.\n\nAt turn 74, y=6, I can choose S to stay at y=6 for turn 75, τ=9.\n\ny=6 at τ=9: safe, since only unsafe at τ=0.\n\nThen at turn 75, y=6, τ=9, I can choose U to y=7 at turn 76, τ=10.\n\nτ=10, y=7: freeway 7 unsafe at τ=0,1,8,9, so at τ=10, safe.\n\nThen at turn 76, y=7, τ=10, choose U to y=8 at turn 77, τ=11.\n\ny=8 at τ=11: unsafe only up to τ=9, so safe.\n\nThen U to y=9 at turn 78, τ=12.\n\nThen at turn 78, y=9, so for H, t_1 + H -1 =78, 66 + H -1 =78, H-1=12, H=13.\n\nThen actions include staying and going down, so H larger.\n\nBut this is not minimal.\n\nTo reach y=9 faster, I need to be on y=8 at a safe time.\n\nThe safe times for y=8 are τ=2 to 7.\n\nBut I can be on y=8 only from turn 74 onwards for minimal path, which is τ=8.\n\nSo I need to be on y=8 earlier, but I can't because it takes at least 8 turns to reach y=8 from y=0.\n\nFrom turn 66 to turn 73: 8 turns, y_{73} <=7.\n\nTurn 74: y_{74} <=8.\n\nSo earliest to be on y=8 is turn 74, τ=8, which is unsafe.\n\nThe only way is to have H larger so that I can be on y=8 at τ=10 or something, but that takes more turns.\n\nPerhaps for y=7, I can be at τ=6.\n\nFor example, at turn 72, τ=6, I can be at y=7 if I have an extra up move earlier, but I can't, as before.\n\nAnother idea: since y=2,3,4,5 are always safe, I can spend less time there or more, but since I have to go through, I need at least one turn on each, but I can pass quickly.\n\nBut to be on y=7 at τ=6, I need to be at y=7 at turn 72.\n\ny_{72} = sum_{t=66}^{71} Δy_t, 6 terms, max 6, so y_{72} <=6, cannot be 7.\n\nSimilarly, impossible.\n\nSo the earliest possible times:\n\n- y=1 at turn 67, τ=1\n\n- y=2 at turn 68, τ=2\n\n- ...\n- y=6 at turn 72, τ=6\n- y=7 at turn 73, τ=7\n- y=8 at turn 74, τ=8\n\nAnd for y=8, τ=8 is unsafe, and I must be on it at that time for minimal H.\n\nTherefore, for minimal H, it is impossible to avoid collision at y=8 τ=8 with H=10.\n\nI need to take a longer path, for example, go to y=8 at a later time when it is safe.\n\nFor instance, be on y=8 at τ=10, turn 76.\n\nThen to reach y=9 at turn 77 or later.\n\nBut let's see if I can do with H=11.\n\nH=11, then t_1 + H -1 =66+11-1=76, so y_{76}=9.\n\nActions from 66 to 75, 10 actions, to set y_{67} to y_{76}.\n\ny_{76} = sum_{t=66}^{75} Δy_t, 10 terms, can be 9 or 10.\n\nTo have y_{76}=9, I can have 9 U and one S, for example.\n\nNow, I need to be on y=8 at a safe τ, say τ=10.\n\nτ=10, turn 76, but at turn 76, I want y=9, so I might not be on y=8 at that turn.\n\nI need to be on y=8 at some turn before.\n\nFor example, at turn 75, I can be on y=8, then U to y=9 at turn 76.\n\nTurn 75, τ=9.\n\ny=8 at τ=9: unsafe, because y=8 unsafe at τ=9.\n\nτ=9 is unsafe.\n\nIf at turn 74, I am on y=8, τ=8, unsafe.\n\nOr at turn 73, y=7, τ=7.\n\nSo to be on y=8 at safe time, say τ=7.\n\nBut at τ=7, turn 73, y max 7, so on y=7.\n\nNot possible.\n\nτ=6, turn 72, y max 6.\n\nSo the only possible safe τ for y=8 are 2,3,4,5,6,7, but I can only be on y=8 at turn 74 or later, which is τ=8 or more, which are all unsafe except for τ>=10.\n\nτ=10 or later is safe.\n\nSo I need to be on y=8 at τ=10 or later.\n\nFor example, at turn 76, τ=10, I can be on y=8.\n\nThen go to y=9 at turn 77.\n\nThen at turn 77, y=9, so for H, t_1 + H -1 =77, 66+H-1=77, H-1=11, H=12.\n\nActions from 66 to 76 for 11 actions, setting y_{67} to y_{77}, with y_{77}=9.\n\nBut let's see if I can do with less.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=8 at τ=10, turn 76.\n\nThen U to y=9 at turn 77.\n\nBut at turn 77, y=9.\n\nWith H=12.\n\nBut earlier with H=10 I had collision, so H=11 might be possible if I can reach y=9 at turn 76.\n\ny_{76}=9.\n\nWith 10 actions from 66 to 75, y_{76} = sum of 10 Δy, can be 9.\n\nThen at turn 76, y=9, safe.\n\nBut I need to pass through y=8 at some point.\n\nWhen I am on y=8, it must be at a safe time.\n\nFor example, if I am on y=8 at turn 75, τ=9, which is unsafe.\n\nOr at turn 74, τ=8, unsafe.\n\nWith all U, I am on y=8 at turn 74, τ=8, collision.\n\nBut with H=11 for y_{76}=9, I can have one stay or down, but that might make me on y=8 later.\n\nFor example, suppose I go up to y=5 quickly, then stay or something.\n\nLet's list the turns and possible y.\n\nTurn 66: τ=0, y=0\n\nI must choose actions.\n\nSuppose I go U at turn 66: y_{67}=1, at τ=1\n\nU at 67: y_{68}=2, τ=2\n\nU at 68: y_{69}=3, τ=3\n\nU at 69: y_{70}=4, τ=4\n\nU at 70: y_{71}=5, τ=5\n\nNow at turn 71, y=5, τ=5\n\nI can choose to stay: S, then y_{72}=5, at τ=6\n\nThen at turn 72, y=5, choose U to y=6 at turn 73, τ=7\n\nAt turn 73, y=6, τ=7, safe for y=6\n\nThen choose U to y=7 at turn 74, τ=8\n\nAt turn 74, y=7, τ=8, but y=7 unsafe at τ=8, collision.\n\nIf at turn 73, y=6, choose U to y=7 at turn 74, τ=8, unsafe.\n\nIf at turn 72, y=5, I choose U to y=6 at turn 73, τ=7\n\nThen at turn 73, y=6, choose S to stay at y=6 for turn 74, τ=8\n\nAt turn 74, y=6, τ=8, safe for y=6\n\nThen at turn 74, choose U to y=7 at turn 75, τ=9\n\nAt turn 75, y=7, τ=9, unsafe for y=7.\n\nStill collision.\n\nIf at turn 74, y=6, I choose U to y=7 at turn 75, τ=9, unsafe.\n\nTo avoid, I need to be on y=7 at τ<=7 or τ>=10.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nBut at τ=7, I can be on y=7.\n\nFor example, at turn 73, τ=7, I can be on y=7 if I have all U except one less action or something.\n\nWith actions from 66 to 72 for y_{73}.\n\ny_{73} = sum_{t=66}^{72} Δy_t, 7 terms, can be 7.\n\nSo at turn 73, τ=7, y=7, safe.\n\nThen I need to go to y=8.\n\nAt turn 73, y=7, choose U to y=8 at turn 74, τ=8, but unsafe.\n\nChoose S to stay at y=7 for turn 74, τ=8, unsafe.\n\nChoose D to y=6 at turn 74, τ=8, safe for y=6.\n\nThen at turn 74, y=6, choose U to y=7 at turn 75, τ=9, unsafe for y=7.\n\nOr at turn 74, y=6, choose S to stay at y=6 for turn 75, τ=9, safe.\n\nThen at turn 75, y=6, choose U to y=7 at turn 76, τ=10, safe for y=7.\n\nThen at turn 76, y=7, choose U to y=8 at turn 77, τ=11, safe for y=8.\n\nThen U to y=9 at turn 78, τ=12.\n\nThen at turn 78, y=9.\n\nSo for H, t_1 + H -1 =78, 66+H-1=78, H-1=12, H=13.\n\nThen y_{78}=9.\n\nBut this is with two stay actions, so H larger.\n\nTo reach faster, from turn 76, y=7, I can go directly to y=9? No, only one step per turn.\n\nSo from y=7 to y=8 to y=9, two more turns.\n\nSo minimum H to avoid is 13 with this path.\n\nBut earlier with all U and H=10, I had collision at y=8 τ=8, but if I could skip y=8 or something, but I can't, I need to be on each y.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps I can go down to lower y to wait, but that might not help.\n\nOr, since y=1 has unsafe times, but I pass early, not issue.\n\nThe problem is only y=7 and y=8 at τ=8 and 9.\n\nBut since I am forced to be there at τ=8 for y=8 in minimal path, I have to delay.\n\nPerhaps for H=11, I can reach y=9 at turn 76 with y_{76}=9.\n\nThen I am not on y=8 at turn 76, but I was on it at some earlier turn, which was unsafe.\n\nFor example, with all U except one stay, I can be at y=9 at turn 76.\n\nActions a66 to a75: 10 actions.\n\nIf 9 U and 1 S, then y_{76} =9.\n\nThe S can be at some point.\n\nSuppose I stay at some safe row.\n\nFor example, at y=5, which is always safe, I can stay one turn.\n\nThen the path:\n\nTurn 66: U, y67=1 τ=1\n\nU, y68=2 τ=2\n\nU, y69=3 τ=3\n\nU, y70=4 τ=4\n\nU, y71=5 τ=5\n\nNow at turn 71, y=5, instead of U, I choose S, so y72=5 at τ=6\n\nThen at turn 72, y=5, choose U, y73=6 at τ=7\n\nAt turn 73, y=6, choose U, y74=7 at τ=8\n\nAt turn 74, y=7, τ=8, unsafe for y=7.\n\nCollision.\n\nIf I stay at a different row.\n\nSuppose at turn 70, y=4, I choose S, y71=4 at τ=5\n\nThen U to y5 at turn 72, τ=6\n\nU to y6 at turn 73, τ=7\n\nU to y7 at turn 74, τ=8, unsafe.\n\nSame issue.\n\nIf I stay at y=3 or something, but then I reach later.\n\nTo be on y=7 at τ=7, I need to be at y=7 at turn 73.\n\nWith all U, I am.\n\nThen to avoid y=8 at τ=8, I can go directly to y=9 from y=7? No, can't.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=8 at τ=10.\n\nBut for H=11, y_{76}=9, I might be on y=8 at turn 75, τ=9, which is unsafe.\n\nSo in all cases for H=11, when I am on y=8, it is at turn 74 or 75, τ=8 or 9, both unsafe.\n\nSimilarly for y=7 at turn 74 or 75, τ=8 or 9, unsafe.\n\nSo it seems impossible to avoid collision with H=10 or 11.\n\nWith H=12, I can be on y=8 at τ=10 or 11, safe.\n\nFor example, y_{76}=8 at τ=10, then U to y9 at turn 77.\n\ny_{77}=9.\n\nThen H=12.\n\nBut let's confirm the car states at other times.\n\nFirst, for freeway 1, unsafe only at τ=16-19, which is late, I will be past by then.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nSo minimal H is 12, with a path that avoids being on y=7 or y=8 at τ=8 or 9.\n\nFor example, stay at a safe row during the unsafe times.\n\nLet's plan the sequence.\n\nStart at turn 66, τ=0, y=0\n\nChoose U: to y=1 at turn 67, τ=1\n\nU: to y=2 at 68, τ=2\n\nU: to y=3 at 69, τ=3\n\nU: to y=4 at 70, τ=4\n\nU: to y=5 at 71, τ=5\n\nNow at turn 71, y=5, I can choose S to stay: y72=5 at turn 72, τ=6\n\nThen at turn 72, y=5, choose U: to y=6 at turn 73, τ=7\n\nAt turn 73, y=6, τ=7, safe for y=6\n\nChoose U: to y=7 at turn 74, τ=8\n\nBut at turn 74, y=7, τ=8, unsafe! Freeway 7 unsafe at τ=8.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt turn 73, y=6, instead of U, I can choose S to stay at y=6 for turn 74, τ=8\n\nAt turn 74, y=6, τ=8, safe for y=6\n\nThen choose U to y=7 at turn 75, τ=9\n\nAt turn 75, y=7, τ=9, unsafe for y=7.\n\nCollision.\n\nAt turn 74, y=6, choose S to stay at y=6 for turn 75, τ=9, safe\n\nThen at turn 75, y=6, choose U to y=7 at turn 76, τ=10, safe for y=7\n\nThen at turn 76, y=7, choose U to y=8 at turn 77, τ=11, safe for y=8\n\nThen at turn 77, y=8, choose U to y=9 at turn 78, τ=12\n\nThen at turn 78, y=9.\n\nSo for H, t_1 + H -1 =78, 66+H-1=78, H-1=12, H=13.\n\nActions from turn 66 to 77? Let's list:\n\nTurn 66: U, to y67=1\n\nTurn 67: U, to y68=2\n\nTurn 68: U, to y69=3\n\nTurn 69: U, to y70=4\n\nTurn 70: U, to y71=5\n\nTurn 71: S, to y72=5  (stayed at y=5)\n\nTurn 72: U, to y73=6\n\nTurn 73: S, to y74=6  (stayed at y=6)\n\nTurn 74: S, to y75=6  (stayed again)\n\nAt turn 74, y=6, choose S, y75=6\n\nThen turn 75: U, to y76=7\n\nBut at turn 75, y=6, choose U, to y76=7 at turn 76, τ=10\n\nThen turn 76: U, to y77=8 at turn 77, τ=11\n\nTurn 77: U, to y78=9 at turn 78, τ=12\n\nAt turn 78, y=9.\n\nSo to have y_{78}=9, and t_1 + H -1 =78, so 66+H-1=78, H-1=12, H=13.\n\nBut at turn 78, y=9, which is the position at that turn.\n\nIn the sequence, I have actions from turn 66 to 77, that's 12 actions? Turns: 66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77 for actions.\n\n12 actions.\n\nThen y_{78}=9.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =66 + H -1 =78, so H-1=12, H=13.\n\nYes.\n\nBut I can reduce the stays.\n\nFor example, after reaching y=5 at turn 71, τ=5, I can go directly to y=6 at turn 72, τ=6.\n\nThen at turn 72, y=6, instead of staying, I can go to y=7 at turn 73, τ=7, safe.\n\nBut then I am at y=7 at τ=7, and I need to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at τ=8 or 9.\n\nSo from turn 73, y=7, I can choose D to go to y=6 at turn 74, τ=8.\n\nAt turn 74, y=6, τ=8, safe.\n\nThen at turn 74, y=6, I can choose U to y=7 at turn 75, τ=9, but unsafe.\n\nOr choose S to stay at y=6 for turn 75, τ=9, safe.\n\nThen at turn 75, y=6, U to y=7 at turn 76, τ=10, safe.\n\nThen U to y=8 at turn 77, τ=11, safe.\n\nU to y=9 at turn 78, τ=12.\n\nSame as before, 13 turns.\n\nFrom turn 73, y=7, τ=7, if I choose U to y=8 at turn 74, τ=8, unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo it seems I need to spend extra turns at lower rows to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nMinimal H is 13.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6 unsafe only at τ=0, which is not relevant.\n\nAnd other rows no issue.\n\nSo for the sequence:\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: U\n\nTurn 68: U\n\nTurn 69: U\n\nTurn 70: U  (now at y=5 at turn 71)\n\nTurn 71: S  (stay at y=5, to y72=5)\n\nTurn 72: U  (to y73=6)\n\nTurn 73: S  (stay at y=6, to y74=6)  -- but at turn 73, y=6, choose S, y74=6\n\nThen at turn 74, y=6, I need to go up later.\n\nTurn 74: S  (stay again, to y75=6)\n\nTurn 75: U  (to y76=7)\n\nTurn 76: U  (to y77=8)\n\nTurn 77: U  (to y78=9)\n\nThen at turn 78, y=9.\n\nBut with three extra stays, H=13.\n\nFrom turn 71: after turn 70 U, y71=5\n\nThen turn 71: U to y72=6 at turn 72, τ=6\n\nTurn 72: y=6, choose S to y73=6 at turn 73, τ=7\n\nTurn 73: y=6, choose S to y74=6 at turn 74, τ=8\n\nTurn 74: y=6, choose U to y75=7 at turn 75, τ=9 -- but y75=7 at τ=9, unsafe!\n\nI forgot.\n\nAt turn 74, y=6, τ=8, choose U to y75=7 at turn 75, τ=9, which is unsafe for y=7.\n\nSo I cannot go to y=7 at τ=9.\n\nMust go later.\n\nTurn 74: S to y75=6 at turn 75, τ=9\n\nThen turn 75: y=6, choose U to y76=7 at turn 76, τ=10, safe\n\nThen turn 76: U to y77=8 at turn 77, τ=11, safe\n\nTurn 77: U to y78=9 at turn 78, τ=12\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 66: U\n\n67: U\n\n68: U\n\n69: U\n\n70: U  (y71=5)\n\n71: U  (y72=6) -- at turn 71, a71 U, from y5 to y6 at turn 72\n\nTurn 71: at position y=5, choose a71=U, then y72=6\n\nThen turn 72: at y=6, choose a72=S, then y73=6\n\nTurn 73: at y=6, choose a73=S, then y74=6\n\nTurn 74: at y=6, choose a74=S, then y75=6\n\nTurn 75: at y=6, choose a75=U, then y76=7\n\nTurn 76: at y=7, choose a76=U, then y77=8\n\nTurn 77: at y=8, choose a77=U, then y78=9\n\nThen at turn 78, y=9.\n\nFor H, t_1 + H -1 =78, 66+H-1=78, H-1=12, H=13.\n\nActions from turn 66 to 77, 12 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, a_{77} is the last action for H=13.\n\nThe position at turn 78 is after a77.\n\nBut we need y_{77} for t_1+H-1? t_1+H-1=66+13-1=78, y78=9.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd no collision: at y=7 at turn 76, τ=10, safe\n\ny=8 at turn 77, τ=11, safe.\n\nOther rows fine.\n\nBut H=13, and I have three stay actions at y=6.\n\nI could have stayed less.\n\nFor example, after reaching y=6 at turn 72, I can stay only one turn, but then I go to y=7 at turn 74, τ=8, unsafe.\n\nSo I need to stay until τ=9 is past.\n\nτ=8 and τ=9 are unsafe for y=7 and y=8.\n\nSo I need to be on y=7 at τ>=10 or <=7.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nAt τ=7, I can be on y=7.\n\nThen I can go down to y=6 at τ=8, which is safe for y=6.\n\nThen at τ=9, I can be on y=6, safe.\n\nThen at τ=10, go to y=7, safe.\n\nThen to y=8 at τ=11, safe.\n\nTo y=9 at τ=12.\n\nNumber of turns: from start to y=7 at τ=7, turn 73.\n\nThen at turn 73, y=7, choose D to y=6 at turn 74, τ=8\n\nThen at turn 74, y=6, choose S to y=6 at turn 75, τ=9\n\nThen at turn 75, y=6, choose U to y=7 at turn 76, τ=10\n\nThen U to y=8 at turn 77, τ=11\n\nU to y=9 at turn 78, τ=12\n\nSame as before, H=13.\n\nOr from turn 74, y=6, I can go directly to y=7 at turn 75, but τ=9 unsafe, not possible.\n\nSo I think H=13 is the minimal to avoid.\n\nBut let's see if I can do with H=12.\n\nH=12, then t_1+H-1=66+12-1=77, y77=9.\n\nActions from 66 to 76, 11 actions, to set y67 to y77.\n\ny77 = sum of 11 Δy, can be 9 with 9 U and 2 S, for example.\n\nI need to be on y=8 at some point, at safe time.\n\nSafe times for y=8 are τ=2,3,4,5,6,7,10,11,...\n\nBut with H=12, I am on y=8 at turn 76 or earlier.\n\nTurn 76 is τ=10, which is safe for y=8.\n\nIf I am on y=8 at turn 76, τ=10, safe.\n\nThen at turn 76, I can choose U to y=9 at turn 77.\n\nBut at turn 77, y=9, so for y77=9, I need to be at y=9 at turn 77.\n\nIf at turn 76, I am on y=8, then U to y=9 at turn 77.\n\nPerfect.\n\nNow, can I be on y=8 at turn 76, τ=10?\n\nYes, with proper timing.\n\nFor example, start with all U to some point, then stay to delay.\n\nTo be at y=8 at turn 76.\n\ny76 =8.\n\ny76 = sum_{t=66}^{75} Δy_t, 10 terms.\n\nTo have y76=8, I can have 8 U and 2 S, or 9 U and 1 D, etc.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nI need to be on lower rows at safe times, but only y=7 and y=8 have restrictions.\n\nFor example, I can be on y=7 at turn 75, τ=9, but τ=9 unsafe for y=7.\n\nOr at turn 74, τ=8, unsafe.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=7 at τ=8 or 9.\n\nSimilarly, I can be on y=7 at τ=10, turn 76.\n\nThen go to y=8 at turn 77, but I want to be on y=8 at turn 76.\n\nAt turn 76, I can be on y=7 or y=8.\n\nIf on y=8, good.\n\nIf on y=7, then to y=8 at turn 77, but then at turn 77, I am on y=8, but I want y=9 at turn 77 for H=12.\n\nLet's set.\n\nFor H=12, y77=9.\n\nAt turn 77, position y=9.\n\nSo at turn 76, I must be at y=8 or y=9.\n\nIf at y=9, then no need to move, but I can be.\n\nBut to be on y=8 at turn 76, then U to y=9 at turn 77.\n\nNow, at turn 76, τ=10, y=8 is safe.\n\nI need to reach y=8 at turn 76.\n\ny76=8.\n\ny76 = sum_{t=66}^{75} Δy_t, 10 actions.\n\nStart from y66=0.\n\nWith 10 actions, I can reach y=8 with 8 U and 2 S, for example.\n\nThe S can be at safe rows.\n\nNow, when I am on y=7, it must not be at τ=8 or 9.\n\nSimilarly for y=8, but at turn 76, τ=10, safe.\n\nSo let's say I go up to y=5 quickly.\n\nTurn 66: U, y67=1 τ=1\n\n67: U, y68=2 τ=2\n\n68: U, y69=3 τ=3\n\n69: U, y70=4 τ=4\n\n70: U, y71=5 τ=5\n\nNow at turn 71, y=5, I can choose S: y72=5 τ=6\n\nThen turn 72: U, y73=6 τ=7\n\nAt turn 73, y=6, τ=7, safe\n\nI can choose U to y=7 at turn 74, τ=8, but unsafe.\n\nChoose S to y=6 at turn 74, τ=8, safe\n\nThen turn 74: S, y75=6 τ=9? Turn 74 action to y75.\n\nAt turn 74, position y=6, choose action.\n\nIf choose S, y75=6 at turn 75, τ=9\n\nThen at turn 75, y=6, τ=9, choose U to y=7 at turn 76, τ=10\n\nAt turn 76, y=7, τ=10, safe\n\nThen I need to go to y=8 and y=9, but at turn 76, y=7, I choose U to y=8 at turn 77, τ=11\n\nBut at turn 77, y=8, but I want y=9 at turn 77.\n\nIf I choose U, y77=8, not 9.\n\nTo have y77=9, I need to be at y=8 at turn 76 or something.\n\nAt turn 76, if I am at y=8, then U to y=9 at turn 77.\n\nSo in the above, at turn 76, I am at y=7, not y=8.\n\nTo be at y=8 at turn 76, I need to have y76=8.\n\nFrom above, after turn 74, I have y75=6.\n\nThen at turn 75, y=6, choose U to y=7 at turn 76, not to y=8.\n\nSo y76=7.\n\nThen to reach y=8 at turn 77, but turn 77 is too late for y77=9.\n\nAt turn 75, if I could be at y=7, then U to y=8 at turn 76.\n\nBut at turn 75, I am at y=6.\n\nTo be at y=7 at turn 75.\n\ny75 = sum_{t=66}^{74} Δy_t, 9 terms, max 9, so can be 7.\n\nFor example, with 7 U and 2 S in the first 9 actions.\n\nBut where to put the S.\n\nSuppose at turn 71, y=5, I choose U to y=6 at turn 72\n\nThen at turn 72, y=6, I choose U to y=7 at turn 73, τ=7, safe\n\nThen at turn 73, y=7, I need to stay or something to avoid going to y=8 at τ=8.\n\nBut at turn 73, y=7, if I choose S, y74=7 at turn 74, τ=8, unsafe.\n\nIf I choose D, y74=6 at turn 74, τ=8, safe.\n\nThen at turn 74, y=6, choose U to y=7 at turn 75, τ=9, unsafe.\n\nOr choose S, y75=6 at turn 75, τ=9, safe.\n\nThen at turn 75, y=6, choose U to y=7 at turn 76, τ=10, safe.\n\nThen at turn 76, y=7, choose U to y=8 at turn 77, τ=11\n\nBut for H=12, I need y77=9, so at turn 77, y=8, not 9.\n\nIf at turn 76, I am at y=8, then U to y=9 at turn 77.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at turn 76, from above, at turn 76, I am at y=7.\n\nSo I think it's not possible with H=12 to avoid collision and reach y=9 at turn 77.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 13 with the path I have.\n\nSo for the answer, I'll go with H=13.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: U\n\nTurn 68: U\n\nTurn 69: U\n\nTurn 70: U  (now at y=5)\n\nTurn 71: U  ( to y=6 at turn 72)\n\nTurn 72: S  (stay at y=6 for turn 73)\n\nTurn 73: S  (stay at y=6 for turn 74)\n\nTurn 74: S  (stay at y=6 for turn 75)\n\nTurn 75: U  ( to y=7 at turn 76)\n\nTurn 76: U  ( to y=8 at turn 77)\n\nTurn 77: U  ( to y=9 at turn 78)\n\nBut at turn 77, a77 U, to y78=9.\n\nThen at turn 78, y=9.\n\nActions from turn 66 to 77, 12 actions.\n\nFor H=13, actions at t_1 to t_1+H-1=66 to 78? t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nH=13, t from 0 to 12, actions at 66 to 78.\n\nBut at turn 78, action a78, which sets y79.\n\nBut we need y78=9.\n\nIn the sequence, a78 should be such that we are at y=9 at turn 78.\n\nSo if at turn 77, we are at y=8, then a77 U to y78=9.\n\nThen a78 can be S or something, but not needed.\n\nIn the sequence, for H=13, actions at 66 to 78, but the position at turn 78 is after a77, before a78.\n\nAt turn T, before action, position y_T.\n\nAfter a_T, y_{T+1} set.\n\nFor turn t_1 + H -1 =78, position y78.\n\nTo have y78=9, it is determined by actions up to a77.\n\na77 sets y78.\n\nThen at turn 78, we are at y78=9, and we choose a78, which can be S to keep y79=9.\n\nBut the sequence includes a78.\n\nIn the path above, at turn 77, y=8 (position), choose a77=U, then y78=9.\n\nThen at turn 78, y=9, choose a78=S, for example, to y79=9.\n\nBut since we reached at turn 78, it's fine.\n\nNow for the sequence, we need to output the actions from turn t1 to the last.\n\nWith the path, let's list the actions and positions.\n\nTurn 66: a66=U, after, y67=1\n\nTurn 67: a67=U, y68=2\n\nTurn 68: a68=U, y69=3\n\nTurn 69: a69=U, y70=4\n\nTurn 70: a70=U, y71=5\n\nTurn 71: a71=U, y72=6  (at turn 72, position y=6)\n\nTurn 72: a72=S, y73=6  (turn 73, y=6)\n\nTurn 73: a73=S, y74=6  (turn 74, y=6)\n\nTurn 74: a74=S, y75=6  (turn 75, y=6)\n\nTurn 75: a75=U, y76=7  (turn 76, y=7)\n\nTurn 76: a76=U, y77=8  (turn 77, y=8)\n\nTurn 77: a77=U, y78=9  (turn 78, y=9)\n\nNow for H=13, actions from 66 to 78? a66 to a77 is 12 actions, missing one.\n\nActions at t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1=12, so 13 actions: t=0 to 12, turns 66 to 78.\n\nAt turn 78, we need to specify a78.\n\nSince y78=9, we can set a78=S, so y79=9.\n\nBut the position at turn 78 is y78=9, which is what we want.\n\nSo the sequence includes a78=S.\n\nIn the list:\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: U\n\nTurn 68: U\n\nTurn 69: U\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nTurn 72: S\n\nTurn 73: S\n\nTurn 74: S\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nTurn 77: U\n\nTurn 78: S  (since at y=9)\n\nAnd H=13.\n\nBut I have three S at y=6, from turn 72 to 74.\n\nAt turn 72, a72=S, y73=6\n\nTurn 73, a73=S, y74=6\n\nTurn 74, a74=S, y75=6\n\nThen turn 75, a75=U, y76=7\n\netc.\n\nAnd no collision.\n\nTo make H smaller, but I think 13 is minimal.\n\nPerhaps I can have only two stays.\n\nFor example, if I am on y=7 at τ=7, turn 73.\n\nThen at turn 73, y=7, choose D to y=6 at turn 74, τ=8\n\nThen at turn 74, y=6, choose S to y=6 at turn 75, τ=9\n\nThen at turn 75, y=6, choose U to y=7 at turn 76, τ=10\n\nU to y=8 at turn 77, τ=11\n\nU to y=9 at turn 78, τ=12\n\nSame as before.\n\nOr from turn 74, y=6, I can go to y=7 at turn 75, but τ=9 unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo I think H=13 is the answer.\n\nSo the minimal number of turns H is 13.\n\nSequence of actions:\n\nTurn 66: U\n\nTurn 67: U\n\nTurn 68: U\n\nTurn 69: U\n\nTurn 70: U\n\nTurn 71: U\n\nTurn 72: S\n\nTurn 73: S\n\nTurn 74: S\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nTurn 77: U\n\nTurn 78: S\n\nBut at turn 78, a78=S, but we are already at y=9, so S is fine.\n\nNow for the box.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 66\\) is 13, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is designed to avoid the unsafe times for freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\), which are unsafe at turn offsets \\(\\tau = 0, 1, 8, 9\\) (where \\(\\tau = T - 66\\)). Specifically:\n- Freeway 7 is unsafe at \\(\\tau = 0, 1, 8, 9\\).\n- Freeway 8 is unsafe at \\(\\tau = 0, 1, 8, 9\\).\n\nThe player must not be on \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) during these unsafe \\(\\tau\\) values. The path involves moving up quickly to \\(y = 6\\) by turn 72 (\\(\\tau = 6\\)), then staying at \\(y = 6\\) for three turns (turns 72, 73, and 74) to avoid being on \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) at \\(\\tau = 8\\) and \\(\\tau = 9\\). After \\(\\tau = 9\\), it is safe to move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 76 (\\(\\tau = 10\\)) and \\(y = 8\\) at turn 77 (\\(\\tau = 11\\)), finally reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 78 (\\(\\tau = 12\\)).\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n\n- At turn 66, move up to \\(y = 1\\).\n- At turn 67, move up to \\(y = 2\\).\n- At turn 68, move up to \\(y = 3\\).\n- At turn 69, move up to \\(y = 4\\).\n- At turn 70, move up to \\(y = 5\\).\n- At turn 71, move up to \\(y = 6\\).\n- At turn 72, stay at \\(y = 6\\) to avoid moving to \\(y = 7\\) at unsafe \\(\\tau = 8\\).\n- At turn 73, stay at \\(y = 6\\) to continue avoiding unsafe times.\n- At turn 74, stay at \\(y = 6\\) to ensure \\(\\tau = 9\\) has passed.\n- At turn 75, move up to \\(y = 7\\) (now safe at \\(\\tau = 10\\)).\n- At turn 76, move up to \\(y = 8\\) (now safe at \\(\\tau = 11\\)).\n- At turn 77, move up to \\(y = 9\\).\n- At turn 78, stay at \\(y = 9\\) (action is \"S\" since the goal is reached).\n\nThis sequence ensures no collision, as:\n- \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 5\\) are always safe or visited at safe times.\n- \\(y = 6\\) is unsafe only at \\(\\tau = 0\\), but visited at \\(\\tau = 6, 7, 8, 9\\) (all safe for \\(y = 6\\)).\n- \\(y = 7\\) is visited at \\(\\tau = 10\\) (safe).\n- \\(y = 8\\) is visited at \\(\\tau = 11\\) (safe).\n\nThe position at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 66 + 13 - 1 = 78\\) is \\((0, 9)\\), as required.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 66: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 67: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 68: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 69: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 70: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 71: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 72: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 73: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 74: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 75: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 76: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 77: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 78: S \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0, 3) at turn t_1 = 69. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. Each turn, the player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at that turn. The span moves left or right based on direction and speed.\n\nImportant point: if the player moves to a different y at turn T, they are not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, they are on y_T, and only cars on y_T can collide at that turn.\n\nThe car states are given for turn t_1=69. For each car, we have head, tail, direction, speed. Direction \"right\" means the car is moving to the right, so the span increases over time. \"Left\" would decrease, but there are no left-moving cars here; all are right-moving.\n\nLet me list the cars per freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car: head h=-39, tail τ=-50, direction right, speed s=3. Since it's right-moving, the head is the front, so at time t, span is [τ + s(t - t_1), h + s(t - t_1)]? Let me check the update rule.\n\nFor right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, it says for right: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)], but in the row, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed). For freeway 1: head h=-39, tail τ=-50. Since direction is right, head should be the right end, so h > τ? Here h=-39, τ=-50, so -39 > -50, yes, head is right, tail is left.\n\nSo at time T, position: left end: τ + s(T-t_1), right end: h + s(T-t_1)\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision if player is on that freeway at time T, and 0 is between left and right ends inclusive? \"0 ∈ Span(T)\", and Span is an interval, so if left ≤ 0 ≤ right, I assume.\n\nThe problem says \"0 ∈ Span(T)\", and Span is [min, max] I think, so yes.\n\nAlso, for freeways with multiple cars, like freeway 6 has two cars, so we need to check all.\n\nPlayer starts at y=3 at t=69.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nSince we can only move up or down one step per turn, the minimal H in terms of vertical moves is at least 6, since from 3 to 9 is 6 steps up. But we might need to wait or move down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 6.\n\nBut we should aim for minimal H, so probably try to go up directly if possible, but check for collisions.\n\nSince cars are moving, the collision points change over time.\n\nAlso, at each turn, when the player is on a certain y, we need that for that y, at that time, no car has 0 in its span.\n\nNow, let's define the time relative to t_1. Set t_1 = 0 for simplicity, so current turn is t=0.\n\nThen at turn t, player position y_t, with y_0 = 3.\n\nWe need y_H = 9 for some H.\n\nt starts from 0.\n\nNow, for each freeway, compute the span at time t (relative to t_1).\n\nt_1 = 69, but since we set t=0 at t_1, time offset is t.\n\nFor a car, at time t (t=0 is now), span:\n\nFor right-moving: left end: τ + s*t, right end: h + s*t\n\nFor left-moving, but none here.\n\nNow, collision on freeway k at time t if y_t = k and for some car on k, left_end <= 0 <= right_end.\n\nPlayer is on freeway y_t at time t.\n\nNow, list all cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: τ=-50, h=-39, s=3, dir right\n\nAt time t: left: -50 + 3t, right: -39 + 3t\n\n0 in span if -50 + 3t <= 0 <= -39 + 3t\n\nWhich is 50/3 <= t <= 39/3? Let's solve:\n\n-50 + 3t <= 0 => 3t <= 50 => t <= 50/3 ≈ 16.666\n\n0 <= -39 + 3t => 39 <= 3t => t >= 13\n\nSo for t in [13, 16.666], since t integer, t=13,14,15,16\n\nAt t=13: left: -50+39= -11? -50 + 3*13 = -50+39= -11, right: -39+39=0, so 0 is included? -11 <= 0 <= 0, yes.\n\nt=14: left: -50+42= -8, right: -39+42=3, 0 in between.\n\nt=15: left: -50+45= -5, right: -39+45=6, 0 in.\n\nt=16: left: -50+48= -2, right: -39+48=9, 0 in.\n\nt=17: left: -50+51=1, right: -39+51=12, 1 <= 0 <=12? 0<1, so 0 not >= left, so not in span. left=1 >0, so 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSimilarly, t=12: left: -50+36= -14, right: -39+36= -3, both negative, 0 > right, not in.\n\nSo freeway 1 is unsafe for t=13,14,15,16.\n\nNow freeway 2: cars: one car, τ=-47, h=-36, s=12, dir right\n\nleft: -47 +12t, right: -36 +12t\n\n0 in span if -47+12t <=0 <= -36+12t\n\nWhich is 47/12 <= t <= 36/12? t >= ceil(47/12) and t <= floor(36/12)? Let's solve inequalities.\n\n-47+12t <=0 => 12t <=47 => t <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916, so t <=3 since integer? t <= floor(47/12)=3? 47/12=3.916, so t<=3.916, so t<=3 for integer t? But let's see:\n\nt <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916, so for t <=3, left <=0?\n\n-47+12t <=0 when 12t <=47, t<=47/12≈3.916, so for t=0,1,2,3, left <=0? At t=0: left=-47<=0, right=-36<=0? 0 <= right? 0 <= -36? No, -36<0, so 0 > right.\n\n0 in span only if left <=0 and 0<=right.\n\nSo left <=0: -47+12t <=0 => t <= 47/12 ≈3.916, so t<=3\n\n0<=right: 0 <= -36+12t => 12t >=36 => t>=3\n\nSo t>=3 and t<=3, so only t=3\n\nAt t=3: left: -47+36= -11, right: -36+36=0, so -11<=0<=0, yes.\n\nt=4: left: -47+48=1, right: -36+48=12, 1<=0<=12? 0<1, no.\n\nt=2: left: -47+24= -23, right: -36+24= -12, both <0, 0>right, no.\n\nSo only unsafe at t=3.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? τ=-47, h=-36, s=12, dir right. Identical to freeway 2.\n\nIn the table, freeway 3 also has one car: (-36,-47,right,12)? Head and tail, let's see: for freeway 2 it's (-36,-47,right,12), but head should be larger? -36 > -47, yes, head h=-36, tail τ=-47.\n\nSimilarly freeway 3: same: (-36,-47,right,12), so same as freeway 2, unsafe only at t=3.\n\nFreeway 4: also (-36,-47,right,12), same.\n\nFreeway 5: also (-36,-47,right,12), same. All freeways 2,3,4,5 have identical cars? But they are different freeways, but the car config is the same.\n\nNow freeway 6: two cars: first car (-36,-47,right,12), second car (36,25,right,12)\n\nFirst car: same as above, τ=-47, h=-36, s=12, unsafe at t=3 only? But this is for freeway 6, so we need to consider both cars.\n\nFirst car: as above, span: left -47+12t, right -36+12t, unsafe when t=3.\n\nSecond car: head=36, tail=25? Direction right, so head should be right, tail left, 36>25, yes.\n\nAt time t: left: 25 + 12t, right: 36 + 12t? Since moving right, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [25 + 12t, 36 + 12t]\n\n0 in span if 25+12t <= 0 <= 36+12t\n\nBut 25+12t >=25 >0 for t>=0, so left >=25>0, so 0 < left, never in span. So this car never has 0 in span, always to the right. So only the first car matters for freeway 6, unsafe at t=3.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: two cars: first (-30,-41,right,6), second (18,7,right,6)\n\nFirst car: τ=-41, h=-30, s=6, dir right\n\nSpan: left -41 +6t, right -30 +6t\n\n0 in span if -41+6t <=0 <= -30+6t\n\nSo -41+6t <=0 => 6t <=41 => t <= 41/6 ≈6.833, t<=6\n\n0 <= -30+6t => 6t >=30 => t>=5\n\nSo t=5,6\n\nAt t=5: left: -41+30= -11, right: -30+30=0, so -11<=0<=0, yes.\n\nt=6: left: -41+36= -5, right: -30+36=6, -5<=0<=6, yes.\n\nt=7: left: -41+42=1, right: -30+42=12, 1<=0<=12? 0<1, no.\n\nt=4: left: -41+24= -17, right: -30+24= -6, both <0, 0>right, no.\n\nSo unsafe at t=5,6.\n\nSecond car on freeway 7: head=18, tail=7? (18,7,right,6), so τ=7, h=18, s=6\n\nSpan: left 7+6t, right 18+6t\n\n0 in span if 7+6t <=0 <=18+6t\n\nBut 7+6t >=7>0 for t>=0, so left>0, 0< left, never <=0, so 0 not in span. Always positive, so no issue.\n\nThus for freeway 7, only unsafe at t=5,6 from first car.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same as freeway 7? Cars: (-30,-41,right,6) and (18,7,right,6), identical to freeway 7.\n\nSo unsafe at t=5,6.\n\nNow summarize the unsafe times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: unsafe t=13,14,15,16\n\n- y=2: unsafe t=3 (only)\n\n- y=3: unsafe t=3\n\n- y=4: unsafe t=3\n\n- y=5: unsafe t=3\n\n- y=6: unsafe t=3 (only, since second car not issue)\n\n- y=7: unsafe t=5,6\n\n- y=8: unsafe t=5,6\n\nPlayer starts at y=3 at t=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn H.\n\ny=9 is the goal, no cars on y=9, since freeways 1-8 have cars, y=9 is safe.\n\nAlso, y=0 might be safe, but we start from y=3.\n\nNow, to minimize H, we should go up as much as possible, but avoid being on unsafe freeways at unsafe times.\n\nSince we can only change y by ±1 or 0 per turn, the path is constrained.\n\nLet me denote the player position over time.\n\nAt t=0: y=3\n\nNow, t=0: we can choose action U, D, or S.\n\nIf U, y=4 at t=1\n\nIf D, y=2 at t=1\n\nIf S, y=3 at t=1\n\nBut at t=0, we are on y=3.\n\nIs y=3 unsafe at t=0? From above, y=3 is unsafe only at t=3, not at t=0.\n\nSimilarly, t=0: y=3 is safe, since unsafe only t=3.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\nMinimal steps: if we go up every turn, from y=3 to y=9 in 6 steps: t=0:3, t=1:4, t=2:5, t=3:6, t=4:7, t=5:8, t=6:9.\n\nBut check for collisions at each step.\n\nt=0: y=3, safe as above.\n\nt=1: y=4? After action, at turn t, we are on y_t.\n\nAt t=1, if we went U at t=0, y=4.\n\ny=4 unsafe at t=1? From above, y=4 unsafe only at t=3, not at t=1, so safe.\n\nt=2: y=5, if we go U again. y=5 unsafe only t=3, not t=2, safe.\n\nt=3: y=6, if we go U. y=6 is unsafe at t=3? Yes, from above, y=6 unsafe at t=3.\n\nSo if at t=3, y=6, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf we stay or something.\n\nAt t=3, we need not to be on y=6, or avoid the unsafe time.\n\nBut y=6 unsafe only at t=3, so if we are not on y=6 at t=3, it might be ok later? But we need to pass through.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=3 we would be on y=6 if we go straight up.\n\nBut unsafe.\n\nWe could delay or change path.\n\nSince y=2,3,4,5,6 all unsafe at t=3 except y=1? y=1 unsafe at t=13-16, not t=3.\n\ny=1 is safe at t=3.\n\ny=0 is also safe, no cars mentioned, I assume safe.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nBut we need to go up.\n\nAt t=3, if we are on y=1 or y=0 or y=7, etc., but y=7 unsafe at t=5,6.\n\nLet's list the unsafe states:\n\nFor each (y,t) pair where collision can occur.\n\nFrom above:\n\n- (y=1, t=13,14,15,16)\n\n- (y=2, t=3)\n\n- (y=3, t=3)\n\n- (y=4, t=3)\n\n- (y=5, t=3)\n\n- (y=6, t=3)\n\n- (y=7, t=5,6)\n\n- (y=8, t=5,6)\n\nAll other (y,t) are safe, I think.\n\ny=0 and y=9 no cars, always safe.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nPlayer at t=0, y=3.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some H.\n\nMinimal H is at least 6.\n\nWith the direct path: t=0:y=3 safe, t=1:y=4 safe (if U), t=2:y=5 safe (if U), but t=3:y=6 unsafe.\n\nSo cannot be at y=6 at t=3.\n\nWe need to not be on y=6 at t=3.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be on y=2,3,4,5 at t=3, all unsafe at t=3.\n\nAt t=3, only safe y are y=0,1,7,8,9? y=7 and y=8 unsafe at t=5,6, but at t=3 they are safe.\n\ny=7 unsafe t=5,6, so at t=3 safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8 safe at t=3.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\ny=0 safe.\n\ny=1 safe at t=3.\n\nBut we start from y=3 at t=0.\n\nWe can, for example, at t=0, move down to y=2, but y=2 at t=0 is safe? y=2 unsafe only at t=3, so at t=0, y=2 safe if we go there.\n\nBut let's think of a sequence.\n\nSince t=3 is bad for y=2 to6, we should be elsewhere at t=3.\n\nFor example, at t=3, we could be on y=1 or y=7 or higher.\n\nBut y=7 is high, from y=3, to y=7 in 3 steps? t=0:3, t=1:4, t=2:5, t=3:6? But y=6 unsafe at t=3.\n\nTo be at y=7 at t=3, we need to move up faster, but we can only move one step per turn, so from t=0 to t=3, we can reach y=3,4,5,6, but not y=7, since max increase 3 steps to y=6.\n\nSimilarly, min to y=0.\n\nSo at t=3, possible y: from start y=3, after 3 moves, y between 0 and 6, inclusive.\n\ny=0 to 6.\n\nBut all y=2,3,4,5,6 unsafe at t=3.\n\ny=1 is safe at t=3, and y=0 safe.\n\nSo at t=3, we must be on y=0 or y=1 to avoid collision.\n\nThen, from there, we need to go up to y=9.\n\nNow, player at t=0, y=3.\n\nTo be at y=0 or y=1 at t=3.\n\ny=0: need to move down 3 times: D,D,D\n\ny=1: move down twice and stay once, or down,down,up? But let's see possible paths to y=1 at t=3.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=0.\n\nAfter three actions, to y=1.\n\nNet change: -2, so two D and one S, in some order.\n\nSimilarly to y=0: three D.\n\nNow, also need to be safe at intermediate steps.\n\nFirst, try to go to y=1 at t=3.\n\nAt t=3, y=1 is safe.\n\nNow, from t=0 to t=3.\n\nt=0: start y=3, safe.\n\nAction at t=0: suppose we do D, to y=2 at t=1.\n\nAt t=1, y=2: is it safe? y=2 unsafe only at t=3, not t=1, so safe.\n\nAction at t=1: to go to y=1 at t=3, we need to decrease or stay.\n\nIf we do D at t=1, y=1 at t=2.\n\nThen at t=2, y=1: is it safe? y=1 unsafe at t=13-16, not t=2, so safe.\n\nThen action at t=2: to be at y=1 at t=3, we can do S, so y=1 at t=3.\n\nThen at t=3, y=1, safe.\n\nSequence so far: t=0: D (to y=2), t=1: D (to y=1), t=2: S (stay y=1), t=3: y=1 safe.\n\nWe could do other orders, but this works.\n\nNow, from here, we need to go to y=9.\n\nAt t=3, y=1.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal steps: 8 steps up? y=1 to y=9, difference 8, so at least 8 turns after t=3.\n\nBut we can start moving up.\n\nNow, y=7 and y=8 unsafe at t=5 and t=6.\n\nt=5 and t=6 relative to t_1, which is t=0.\n\nSo t=5 and t=6 are future times.\n\nAt t=3, we are at y=1.\n\nNow, if we go up directly: t=3: y=1, action U, t=4: y=2\n\nt=4: y=2, is it safe? y=2 unsafe only at t=3, not t=4, so safe.\n\nAction U, t=5: y=3\n\nt=5: y=3, is it safe? y=3 unsafe only at t=3, not t=5, so safe.\n\nAction U, t=6: y=4\n\nt=6: y=4, unsafe? y=4 unsafe only at t=3, not t=6, safe.\n\nAction U, t=7: y=5\n\ny=5 unsafe only t=3, safe at t=7.\n\nAction U, t=8: y=6\n\ny=6 unsafe only t=3, safe at t=8.\n\nAction U, t=9: y=7\n\nNow t=9: y=7.\n\nBut y=7 unsafe at t=5 and t=6, not t=9, so safe.\n\nThen U to t=10: y=8\n\nt=10: y=8, unsafe at t=5,6? Not t=10, safe.\n\nThen U to t=11: y=9, reached.\n\nBut y=9 at t=11.\n\nTotal turns: from t=0 to t=11, H=12? t is the turn index.\n\nAt turn t, after action, position.\n\nLet's list the sequence.\n\nStart t=0: position y=3\n\nAfter action at t=0, position at t=1.\n\nIn terms of turns: at turn T, we take action a_T, then position at T+1? Let's see the update.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nSo at time t, we take action a_t, then y_{t+1} is the position after the action.\n\nBut collision is at time t based on y_t, I think.\n\nThe collision condition: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\ny_T is the position at turn T, I believe.\n\n\"at turn T, you are on freeway y_T\"\n\nAnd \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered on y_{T+1} at turn T\"\n\nSo at turn T, position is y_T, and we are on freeway y_T at that turn.\n\nThen after action, y_{T+1} is new position.\n\nIn the sequence, for each turn T, we have y_T, and action a_T determines y_{T+1}.\n\nWe start at turn t_1, which is T=69, but we set t=0 for simplicity.\n\nAt t=0, position y_0 = 3.\n\nWe take action a_0, then y_1 = y_0 + Δy based on a_0.\n\nThen at turn t=1, position y_1, and so on.\n\nCollision at turn T if for y_T, 0 is in some car span on that freeway at time T.\n\nIn our case, T is absolute turn, but since we set t_1=0, time t is offset.\n\nIn span calculation, we used t relative to t_1.\n\nNow, in the path to y=1 at t=3.\n\nt=0: position y=3, take action a_0.\n\nIf a_0 = D, then y_1 = 3 -1 =2\n\nAt turn t=1, position y=2, which is safe, since unsafe only at t=3.\n\nTake action a_1, if a_1=D, then y_2 = 2-1=1\n\nAt turn t=2, position y=1, safe.\n\nTake action a_2=S, then y_3 =1 +0=1\n\nAt turn t=3, position y=1, safe.\n\nNow, from here, at t=3, y=1, take action U, then y_4=1+1=2\n\nAt turn t=4, position y=2, safe (unsafe only t=3)\n\nTake action U, y_5=2+1=3\n\nAt turn t=5, position y=3, safe (unsafe only t=3)\n\nTake action U, y_6=3+1=4\n\nAt turn t=6, position y=4, safe\n\nTake action U, y_7=4+1=5\n\nt=7, y=5, safe\n\nU, y_8=5+1=6\n\nt=8, y=6, safe\n\nU, y_9=6+1=7\n\nt=9, y=7, now y=7 unsafe at t=5 and t=6, not t=9, so safe.\n\nU, y_10=7+1=8\n\nt=10, y=8, unsafe at t=5,6, not t=10, safe.\n\nU, y_11=8+1=9\n\nt=11, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, total turns from start: from t=0 to t=11, but at t=11, y=9, so we have taken actions from a_0 to a_10, since a_t for t=0 to 10, 11 actions? Let's see.\n\nActions: a_t for t=0 to H-1, such that after H actions, y_H =9.\n\nStart: at t=0, before action, y_0=3.\n\nAfter a_0, y_1\n\nAfter a_1, y_2\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{k}, y_{k+1}\n\nSet y_H =9 after H actions.\n\nSo we need y_H =9.\n\nIn this case, at t=11, y_11=9, which is after 11 actions: a_0 to a_10.\n\nH=11 turns? The sequence has H actions.\n\nMinimal H should be less, but we had to detour.\n\nIn this path, we used 11 actions: from t=0 to t=10 actions, y_11=9.\n\nBut we can reach faster if we go directly after avoiding t=3.\n\nAnother idea: at t=3, be at y=0 or y=1, but since we need to go up, y=1 better.\n\nBut from y=1 at t=3, to y=9, need 8 steps, so at least 8 actions after, so y at t=3+8=11.\n\nBut we started at t=0, so H=11.\n\nPerhaps we can be at higher y at t=3, but earlier we can only be up to y=6 at t=3, but unsafe.\n\nUnless we move slower before t=3.\n\nFor example, at t=0, S or something.\n\nBut if we go up slowly, we might be at y=4 or5 at t=3, but unsafe.\n\nCannot be on y=2-6 at t=3.\n\nSo must be y<=1 at t=3.\n\ny=0 or1.\n\ny=1 is closer.\n\nNow, after t=3, we need to go up, but there is another unsafe period at t=5,6 for y=7 and8.\n\nIn the above path, when we reach y=7 at t=9, which is after t=6, so safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8 at t=10, safe.\n\nBut t=5 and6 are early, we are at lower y then.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=5, we were at y=3, which is safe.\n\nt=6 at y=4, safe.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nBut H=11 seems long.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=9 faster by avoiding the y=7,8 unsafe times differently.\n\nSince y=7 and8 unsafe only at t=5,6, we can be on them before or after.\n\nFor example, to reach y=9 earlier, we need to be at higher y earlier.\n\nBut at t=3, we are forced to be low.\n\nAnother idea: instead of going down, we go up but skip the unsafe freeway at critical times.\n\nFor example, from start, at t=0, y=3, take U to y=4 at t=1.\n\nt=1, y=4, take U to y=5 at t=2.\n\nt=2, y=5, now at t=2, safe.\n\nBut at t=3, if we go to y=6, unsafe.\n\nSo instead, at t=2, y=5, we can take D to y=4 at t=3? But y=4 unsafe at t=3.\n\nTake S to stay y=5 at t=3, but y=5 unsafe at t=3.\n\nNot possible.\n\nTake D to y=4 at t=3, unsafe.\n\nCannot be on y=4 or5 at t=3.\n\nSo the only safe at t=3 are y=0,1.\n\nThus we must go down initially.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=7 or8 before t=5.\n\nBut from t=0, to be at y=7 at t=4, for example.\n\ny=7 at t=4.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=0, to y=7 at t=4, need +4 in 4 steps, so all U.\n\nSequence: t=0: U, y_1=4\n\nt=1: U, y_2=5\n\nt=2: U, y_3=6\n\nBut at t=3, y=6, unsafe! Problem.\n\nt=2: y=5, if U to y=6 at t=3, unsafe.\n\nIf at t=2, we do S or D, but then not reach y=7 at t=4.\n\nFor example, t=0: U, y1=4\n\nt=1: U, y2=5\n\nt=2: S, y3=5, then at t=3, y=5, unsafe.\n\nt=2: D, y3=4, unsafe at t=3.\n\nCannot reach y=7 before t=5 except through unsafe at t=3.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=7 at t=4, we need y3=6 or7, but y3=6 unsafe, y3=7 impossible from y=3 in 3 steps.\n\nMax y3=6.\n\nSo cannot be on y=7 before t=5.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nThus, the earliest we can be at y=9 is later.\n\nIn the down-then-up path, we reach at t=11.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nPerhaps we can go up faster after t=3.\n\nIn the sequence I had, from t=3 y=1, we go up step by step to y=9 at t=11.\n\nBut y=7 and8 unsafe at t=5,6, but we are on them at t=9,10, which is fine.\n\nNow, is there a way to save turns?\n\nFor example, after t=3, instead of going directly, we could go to y=0 or something, but that would be worse.\n\nAt t=3, y=1, we can go up, but when we reach y=7, we need to avoid t=5,6, but since t=5,6 are past when we are at y=7, no issue.\n\nAnother thing: y=1 has unsafe at t=13-16, but in our path, we are on y=1 only at t=2,3, which is before t=13, so safe.\n\nNow, let's see if we can reach earlier by not going all the way to y=1.\n\nFor example, at t=3, be at y=1, but we could be at y=0.\n\nBut y=0 to y=9 takes more steps.\n\nWorse.\n\nPerhaps we can stay at some y until t=3 passes.\n\nBut at t=0, y=3, if we stay, t=1 y=3, t=2 y=3, then at t=2 y=3, safe, but at t=3 if we stay y=3, unsafe.\n\nIf we move at t=2.\n\nBut from y=3 at t=2, we can go U to y=4 at t=3, unsafe; D to y=2 at t=3, unsafe; S to y=3, unsafe. No safe action at t=2 to avoid unsafe at t=3 except by being at different y.\n\nBut at t=2, y=3, we must take action that puts us at safe y at t=3, but the only safe are y=0 or1, which from y=3 at t=2, we can do D to y=2 at t=3, but y=2 unsafe; or D twice? But we can only one action per turn.\n\nAt turn t=2, we take action a_2, then y_3 = y_2 + Δy.\n\ny_2=3, so y_3 can be 2,3,4, all unsafe at t=3.\n\nImpossible to be safe at t=3 from there.\n\nTherefore, we must not be on y=3 at t=2 if we want to be safe at t=3, but we need to be at low y earlier.\n\nHence, the only way is to move down before t=3.\n\nThus, the path I have seems necessary.\n\nBut let's check if we can be at y=1 at t=3 with fewer downs.\n\nFor example, at t=0, S to stay y=3, but then at t=1 y=3, then need to go down.\n\nt=0: S, y1=3\n\nt=1: y=3, take D, y2=2\n\nt=2: y=2, take D, y3=1\n\nThen at t=3, y=1 safe.\n\nSame as before, but we wasted a turn staying at t=0.\n\nThen from t=3 y=1, same up path, reach y=9 later.\n\nWorse.\n\nt=0: D, y1=2\n\nt=1: S, y2=2? Then t=2: D to y3=1, etc., but y=2 at t=1 safe, but then at t=3 y=1 same.\n\nNo gain.\n\nSo minimal is to go down directly to y=1 by t=3.\n\nNow, about the unsafe at t=5,6 for y=7,8.\n\nIn our path, we are on y=7 at t=9>6, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut is there a way to reach y=9 before t=11?\n\nFor example, if we can be at higher y at t=3, but we can't.\n\nPerhaps go to y=0 at t=3, but then from y=0 to y=9, 9 steps, reach at t=12, worse.\n\nSo y=1 at t=3 is best.\n\nNow, from y=1 at t=3, go up to y=9 in 8 steps: t=3 to t=11, y_11=9.\n\nActions from a_3 to a_10.\n\nBut total actions from a_0 to a_10, 11 actions.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut let's list the actions with times.\n\nIn the answer, we need to output actions starting from turn t_1.\n\nt_1=69.\n\nBut in the sequence, relative to t_1.\n\nSet t=0 as t_1.\n\nSo actions for turn t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nIn this case, H=11 actions.\n\nSequence:\n\nAt turn t_1 + 0 = 69: action D? In my earlier, a_0 = D\n\nPosition: start y_0=3\n\na_0 = D, then y_1 = 2\n\nAt turn t=1 (t_1+1), position y_1=2, take a_1 = D, y_2=1\n\nTurn t=2, y_2=1, take a_2 = S, y_3=1\n\nTurn t=3, y_3=1, take a_3 = U, y_4=2\n\nTurn t=4, y_4=2, take a_4 = U, y_5=3\n\nTurn t=5, y_5=3, take a_5 = U, y_6=4\n\nTurn t=6, y_6=4, take a_6 = U, y_7=5\n\nTurn t=7, y_7=5, take a_7 = U, y_8=6\n\nTurn t=8, y_8=6, take a_8 = U, y_9=7\n\nTurn t=9, y_9=7, take a_9 = U, y_10=8\n\nTurn t=10, y_10=8, take a_10 = U, y_11=9\n\nAt turn t=10, after a_10, y_11=9.\n\nSo we have actions from a_0 to a_10, that's 11 actions.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut at t=10, we take action, then y_11=9.\n\nSo reached at step 11.\n\nNow, is this minimal?\n\nPerhaps we can avoid the stay at t=2.\n\nIn the down part, to reach y=1 at t=3, we could do: t=0: D to y=2, t=1: D to y=1, then at t=2, if we take U, y_3=2, but at t=3, y=2, which is unsafe! y=2 unsafe at t=3.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf at t=2 y=1, we take U, y_3=2, then at turn t=3, position y=2, unsafe.\n\nIf we take S, y_3=1, safe.\n\nBut if we take D, y_3=0, safe, but then from y=0, need more up.\n\nSo S is better.\n\nThus, we need to stay at y=1 at t=3.\n\nNo choice.\n\nPerhaps we can go directly to y=9 without going down, by timing.\n\nFor example, if we stay at y=3 until t=4.\n\nBut at t=0: S, y1=3\n\nt=1: S, y2=3\n\nBut at t=1, y=3 safe? t=1 not t=3, safe.\n\nt=2: S, y3=3, but at t=3, y=3 unsafe! Cannot.\n\nAt t=2, we must move, but as before, cannot go to safe y.\n\nSo impossible to stay.\n\nThus, the path with H=11 seems necessary.\n\nBut let's check if we can reach y=9 earlier by going through y=7 or 8 when safe.\n\nBut y=7 unsafe at t=5,6, so we can be on y=7 at t=4 or t=7, etc.\n\nBut to be at y=7 at t=4: from start, t=0 to t=4, 4 steps, from y=3 to y=7, need +4, so U,U,U,U.\n\nt=0: U, y1=4\n\nt=1: U, y2=5\n\nt=2: U, y3=6\n\nt=3: U, y4=7\n\nBut at t=3, y=6, unsafe! During the move.\n\nIf we start later, but we have to take actions.\n\nNo, cannot reach y=7 at t=4 without being unsafe at t=3.\n\nSimilarly, at t=7: y=7.\n\nBut to be at y=7 at t=7.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=0, need +4 in 7 steps, but we can take slower, but we want minimal H, so better to go faster.\n\nBut in our case, with detour, we reach at t=11.\n\nWithout detour, we cannot because of t=3.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=6 after t=3.\n\nFor example, at t=3, be at y=1, then go up, but at t=4 y=2, t=5 y=3, etc., as before.\n\nPerhaps from y=1 at t=3, we can go to y=8 or something faster, but no, step by step.\n\nUnless we wait, but waiting increases H.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 6 and others.\n\nFreeway 6 has two cars, but we saw only one affects, unsafe at t=3.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nNow, about the action sequence.\n\nIn the sequence, we have a_2 = S at t=2.\n\nBut perhaps we can avoid that by going to y=0.\n\nFor example, t=0: D, y1=2\n\nt=1: D, y2=1? t=1: if a1=D, y2=1 (since y1=2, D to 1)\n\nThen at t=2, y=1, we can take D to y3=0 at t=3.\n\nThen at t=3, y=0, safe.\n\nThen from y=0 at t=3, go up to y=9.\n\nt=3: U, y4=1\n\nt=4: U, y5=2\n\nt=5: U, y6=3\n\nt=6: U, y7=4\n\nt=7: U, y8=5\n\nt=8: U, y9=6\n\nt=9: U, y10=7\n\nt=10: U, y11=8\n\nt=11: U, y12=9\n\nReached at t=12, worse than before.\n\nWith stay, we reached at t=11.\n\nIn the first sequence, with S, we have y_11=9 at t=11.\n\nWithout S, we have to be at y=1 or something.\n\nPerhaps at t=2, from y=1, we take U to y=2 at t=3, but unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo the S is necessary to wait at y=1 for t=3.\n\nThus, minimal H=11.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to output actions.\n\nt_1=69.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 69: D\n\nTurn 70: D  (t=1)\n\nTurn 71: S  (t=2)\n\nTurn 72: U  (t=3)\n\nTurn 73: U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 79: U for y=9.\n\nList:\n\nAfter a_0 at t=69, y=2 at t=70? Positions:\n\nAt turn t_1=69, position y=3\n\nAction a_{69} = D, then at turn 70, position y=2\n\nThen at turn 70, action a_{70} = D, position at turn 71: y=1\n\nAt turn 71, action a_{71} = S, position at turn 72: y=1\n\nAt turn 72, action a_{72} = U, position at turn 73: y=2\n\nAt turn 73, action a_{73} = U, position at turn 74: y=3\n\nAt turn 74, action a_{74} = U, position at turn 75: y=4\n\nAt turn 75, action a_{75} = U, position at turn 76: y=5\n\nAt turn 76, action a_{76} = U, position at turn 77: y=6\n\nAt turn 77, action a_{77} = U, position at turn 78: y=7\n\nAt turn 78, action a_{78} = U, position at turn 79: y=8\n\nAt turn 79, action a_{79} = U, position at turn 80: y=9\n\nReached at turn 80.\n\nActions from turn 69 to turn 79, that's 11 actions: turns 69 to 79 inclusive? Turn indices.\n\nTurn t_1 + t for t=0 to 10, so turns 69 to 79, 11 turns.\n\nH=11.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 79, we take U, and after that, at turn 80, position is (0,9).\n\nThe sequence is actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nSo for H=11, actions from turn 69 to 69+10=79.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, write the actions:\n\nTurn 69: D\n\nTurn 70: D\n\nTurn 71: S\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nTurn 73: U\n\nTurn 74: U\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nTurn 77: U\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nTurn 79: U\n\nIn the up part, from turn 72 U to turn 79 U, that's 8 U actions? Turn 72: U (to y=2), 73:U (y=3), 74:U (y=4), 75:U (y=5), 76:U (y=6), 77:U (y=7), 78:U (y=8), 79:U (y=9). Yes, 8 U.\n\nBut we had two D and one S before.\n\nIn the sequence above.\n\nNow, but in the car states, freeway 1 has unsafe at t=13,14,15,16, but in our path, we are not on y=1 at those times, so ok.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nI think this should work.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nSuppose we go to y=0 at t=3.\n\nt=0: D, y1=2\n\nt=1: D, y2=1\n\nt=2: D, y3=0\n\nThen t=3: y=0, take U, y4=1\n\nThen same as before, but from y=1 at t=4, later, so reach y=9 at t=12, worse.\n\nNot better.\n\nStart with S at t=0, but then need to go down, same or worse.\n\nThus, minimal H=11.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 71, we have S, which is stay.\n\nBut perhaps we can optimize the up part to avoid potential issues, but no issues.\n\nAnother thing: freeway 7 and 8 unsafe at t=5,6, but we are on them at t=77 and 78, which is fine.\n\nt=77 and 78 correspond to absolute time t_1 +77? No.\n\nIn relative time.\n\nt_1=69, we set t=0.\n\nAt turn t=77 relative? Turn index.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 78 is when we take action to go to y=8? Let's see absolute.\n\nAt turn 79, we take U to go to y=9 at turn 80.\n\nBut the collision is at the turn when position is set.\n\nIn this case, all safe.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo the minimal H is 11 with the sequence above.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nFirst, H=11.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 69: D\n\nTurn 70: D\n\nTurn 71: S\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nTurn 73: U\n\nTurn 74: U\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nTurn 77: U\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nTurn 79: U\n\nIn the up part, from turn 72 to 79, all U, but turn 72 is first U after S.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps we can start going up earlier, but no.\n\nAnother idea: after t=3, when we go up, at some point we can skip, but no, we have to move step by step.\n\nI think this is minimal.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 69\\) is 11, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is determined as follows:\n- The player must avoid being on freeways \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\) at turn \\(t = 3\\) (relative to \\(t_1 = 0\\)) because these positions are unsafe due to car collisions at that turn.\n- To achieve this, the player moves down to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 69, then to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 70, and stays at \\(y = 1\\) at turn 71. This ensures the player is at \\(y = 1\\) at turn 72 (relative turn \\(t = 3\\)), which is safe.\n- From turn 72 onwards, the player moves up continuously to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 80.\n- The unsafe periods for \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) at turns \\(t = 5\\) and \\(t = 6\\) (relative) are avoided, as the player reaches \\(y = 7\\) at turn 78 and \\(y = 8\\) at turn 79, which is after the unsafe times.\n\nThe action sequence, with actions taken at each turn from \\(t_1 = 69\\) to \\(t_1 + 10 = 79\\), is:\n\n- Turn 69: Move down (D) to position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn 70.\n- Turn 70: Move down (D) to position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn 71.\n- Turn 71: Stay (S) to remain at \\((0, 1)\\) at turn 72.\n- Turn 72: Move up (U) to position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn 73.\n- Turn 73: Move up (U) to position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn 74.\n- Turn 74: Move up (U) to position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn 75.\n- Turn 75: Move up (U) to position \\((0, 5)\\) at turn 76.\n- Turn 76: Move up (U) to position \\((0, 6)\\) at turn 77.\n- Turn 77: Move up (U) to position \\((0, 7)\\) at turn 78.\n- Turn 78: Move up (U) to position \\((0, 8)\\) at turn 79.\n- Turn 79: Move up (U) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 80.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in 11 turns with no collisions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 69: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 70: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 71: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 72: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 73: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 74: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 75: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 76: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 77: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 78: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 79: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0, 0) on turn t_1 = 72. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. Each turn, the player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nThe car positions are given for each freeway at turn t_1. I need to find where the cars will be at future turns to avoid collisions. Collision happens only if the player is on a freeway y at turn T, and for that y, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that exact turn T.\n\nThe note says: if you move to a different y at turn T, you're not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, you're on y_T, and you decide to move to y_{T+1}, but during turn T, you're still on y_T for collision purposes. Collision is checked based on your position at the start of the turn, I think. Let me read carefully.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is your position at turn T.\n\nAlso, \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\", so at turn T, you're on y_T, and collision is checked for y_T.\n\nThen, after moving, at turn T+1, you're on y_{T+1}, and collision is checked for y_{T+1}.\n\nNow, the car spans move over time. For left-moving cars, span decreases, for right-moving, it increases, with speed s per turn.\n\nAll cars here are right-moving, based on the data.\n\nLet me list the cars:\n\nFreeway 1: one car, head -48, tail -59, right, speed 3. Since it's right-moving, head should be greater than tail? The notation says for right-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h] with τ < h, I think? Let's see the update.\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIn the table, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction, speed).\n\nFor freeway 1: head h = -48, tail τ = -59, direction right, speed 3.\n\nSince it's right-moving, the head is at the front, so at t1, position from τ to h, which is from -59 to -48.\n\nBut -59 < -48, so τ = -59, h = -48, so span is [-59, -48] at t1.\n\nThen at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-59 + 3(T-72), -48 + 3(T-72)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, when player is on freeway k, 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nFor freeway k, if y_T = k, and for any car on k, 0 ∈ [low, high] where low and high are the tail and head positions at T.\n\nSince all cars are right-moving, and head > tail, so low = tail position, high = head position.\n\nIn the span, for right-moving, it's [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] with τ < h.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all are right.\n\nNow, freeway 6 and 7 and 8 have multiple cars.\n\nFreeway 6: two cars: (48, 37, right, 12) and (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: head 48, tail 37, right, speed 12. So at t1, span [37,48]\n\nSecond car: head 0, tail -11, right, speed 12. So at t1, span [-11, 0]\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (-48, -59, right, 6) and (0, -11, right, 6)\n\nFirst: head -48, tail -59, so span [-59, -48]\n\nSecond: head 0, tail -11, span [-11, 0]\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7: (-48, -59, right, 6) and (0, -11, right, 6)\n\nNow, freeway 2,3,4,5 all have only one car: (48, 37, right, 12) each, so span [37,48] at t1.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-48, -59, right, 3), span [-59, -48] at t1.\n\nPlayer starts at y=0 at t1=72. y=0 is not a freeway, freeways are y=1 to 8, so at y=0, no cars, so no collision possible. Similarly, y=9 is the goal, no cars.\n\nBut to reach y=9, player needs to go through y=1 to 8.\n\nNow, the minimal number of turns to go from y=0 to y=9 is at least 9 moves up, but since we can stay, it could be more, but we want minimal H, so probably we want to go up as fast as possible, avoiding cars.\n\nBut we might need to wait sometimes to avoid collisions.\n\nSince we start at y=0, and at turn t1, we are at (0,0), we can take action at turn t1 to move to y=1 or stay or down, but down to y=-1 not possible, y min 0, so at t1, possible actions: U to go to y=1, or S to stay y=0.\n\nD would go to y=-1, invalid, so not possible. So only U or S at t1.\n\nSimilarly, at other positions.\n\nBut since we want to go to y=9, U is better.\n\nBut we have to avoid collisions on the freeways.\n\nNow, let's find when it's safe to be on each freeway.\n\nFor each freeway k, and for each turn T, we need to know if there is a car such that 0 is in its span at T.\n\nIf not, then it's safe to be on freeway k at turn T.\n\nSince multiple cars per freeway, we need that for all cars on k, 0 not in span at T.\n\nSpan at T depends on ΔT = T - t1.\n\nSet t1 = 72, so ΔT = T - 72.\n\nFor a car on freeway k, with given (head, tail, dir, speed) at t1.\n\nSince all right, dir right.\n\nPosition at time T: tail_T = tail + s * ΔT\n\nhead_T = head + s * ΔT\n\nSpan is [tail_T, head_T]\n\n0 in span if tail_T ≤ 0 ≤ head_T\n\nSince tail_T ≤ head_T.\n\nNow, for each freeway, let's find the times when it is unsafe, i.e., when there exists a car with 0 in span.\n\nThen safe when for all cars, 0 not in span.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car: tail=-59, head=-48, s=3\n\ntail_T = -59 + 3ΔT\n\nhead_T = -48 + 3ΔT\n\n0 in span if -59 + 3ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 3ΔT\n\nWhich is -59 + 3ΔT ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -48 + 3ΔT\n\nSo 3ΔT ≤ 59 and -48 + 3ΔT ≥ 0? Let's solve inequalities.\n\n-59 + 3ΔT ≤ 0 ⇒ 3ΔT ≤ 59 ⇒ ΔT ≤ 59/3 ≈ 19.666, so ΔT ≤ 19 since integer\n\n0 ≤ -48 + 3ΔT ⇒ 3ΔT ≥ 48 ⇒ ΔT ≥ 16\n\nSo for ΔT from 16 to 19 inclusive, unsafe.\n\nΔT=16: tail_T = -59 + 3*16 = -59 + 48 = -11\n\nhead_T = -48 + 48 = 0\n\nSo span [-11,0], 0 is in it.\n\nΔT=17: tail_T = -59 + 51 = -8? 3*17=51, -59+51=-8, head_T=-48+51=3, span [-8,3], 0 in.\n\nΔT=18: tail_T=-59+54=-5, head_T=-48+54=6, span [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nΔT=19: tail_T=-59+57=-2, head_T=-48+57=9, span [-2,9], 0 in.\n\nΔT=20: tail_T=-59+60=1, head_T=-48+60=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nΔT=15: tail_T=-59+45=-14, head_T=-48+45=-3, span [-14,-3], 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe for ΔT=16,17,18,19.\n\nSafe otherwise for freeway 1.\n\nNow freeway 2: one car: tail=37, head=48, s=12\n\ntail_T = 37 + 12ΔT\n\nhead_T = 48 + 12ΔT\n\n0 in span if 37 + 12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 48 + 12ΔT\n\nBut 37 + 12ΔT ≤ 0? Since ΔT ≥0, 12ΔT ≥0, so 37 + positive >0, so 37+12ΔT >0, so 0 cannot be ≤ head_T only if head_T negative, but head_T=48+12ΔT ≥48>0, so 0 ≤ head_T always true since head_T ≥48>0.\n\nBut 0 in span requires tail_T ≤ 0 ≤ head_T.\n\ntail_T =37+12ΔT ≥37>0, so tail_T >0, so 0 < tail_T ≤ head_T, so 0 not in [tail_T, head_T] because tail_T >0.\n\nSo for all ΔT, tail_T ≥37>0, head_T>0, so 0 not in span. Always safe for freeway 2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as 2, car (48,37,right,12), so same as above, always safe.\n\nFreeway 4: same, always safe.\n\nFreeway 5: same, always safe.\n\nNow freeway 6: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12) same as above, span [37+12ΔT, 48+12ΔT], both >0, so 0 not in span for this car, ever.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12) head=0, tail=-11, s=12\n\ntail_T = -11 + 12ΔT\n\nhead_T = 0 + 12ΔT = 12ΔT\n\n0 in span if tail_T ≤ 0 ≤ head_T\n\nWhich is -11 + 12ΔT ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 12ΔT\n\nFirst: -11 + 12ΔT ≤ 0 ⇒ 12ΔT ≤ 11 ⇒ ΔT ≤ 11/12 <1, so ΔT ≤ 0? Since ΔT integer, 12ΔT ≤11 only if ΔT=0, but ΔT = T-t1, at T=t1, ΔT=0.\n\nAt ΔT=0: tail_T = -11 +0 = -11, head_T=0, span [-11,0], 0 is in it.\n\nFor ΔT≥1, 12ΔT ≥12>0, and -11+12ΔT ≥ -11+12=1>0? At ΔT=1, tail_T=-11+12=1, head_T=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nΔT=0: 0 in span.\n\nBut ΔT=0 is turn T=t1=72.\n\nNow, for freeway 6, at turn T, unsafe if either car has 0 in span.\n\nFirst car never has 0 in span.\n\nSecond car has 0 in span only at ΔT=0, i.e., turn t1.\n\nFor ΔT>0, safe.\n\nAt T=t1, ΔT=0, unsafe for freeway 6 because of second car.\n\nBut player is at y=0 at t1, not on freeway 6.\n\nNow, when player moves to freeway 6, it will be at some future turn.\n\nFor freeway 6, it is unsafe only at T=t1, but since player is not on it at t1, for T>t1, it should be safe.\n\nConfirm: at T=t1, freeway 6 has car with span [-11,0] at that turn, so if player were on y=6 at t1, collision, but player is at y=0.\n\nAt T>t1, say T=t1+1, ΔT=1, for second car, span [1,12], 0 not in, first car [37+12,48+12]=[49,60], 0 not in. So safe.\n\nSimilarly for later turns. So freeway 6 is always safe for T > t1.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,6) tail=-59, head=-48, s=6\n\ntail_T = -59 + 6ΔT\n\nhead_T = -48 + 6ΔT\n\n0 in span if -59 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 6ΔT\n\nWhich requires -59 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -48 + 6ΔT\n\nFirst: -59 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 ⇒ 6ΔT ≤ 59 ⇒ ΔT ≤ 59/6 ≈ 9.833, so ΔT ≤ 9\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48 + 6ΔT ⇒ 6ΔT ≥ 48 ⇒ ΔT ≥ 8\n\nSo for ΔT=8 and 9, unsafe.\n\nΔT=8: tail_T = -59 + 48 = -11, head_T = -48 + 48 = 0, span [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nΔT=9: tail_T = -59 + 54 = -5, head_T = -48 + 54 = 6, span [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nΔT=10: tail_T=-59+60=1, head_T=-48+60=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nΔT=7: tail_T=-59+42=-17, head_T=-48+42=-6, span [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe ΔT=8,9.\n\nSecond car on freeway 7: (0,-11,right,6) head=0, tail=-11, s=6\n\ntail_T = -11 + 6ΔT\n\nhead_T = 0 + 6ΔT = 6ΔT\n\n0 in span if -11 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 6ΔT\n\n-11 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 ⇒ 6ΔT ≤ 11 ⇒ ΔT ≤ 11/6 ≈1.833, so ΔT ≤1\n\nAnd 0 ≤ 6ΔT always for ΔT≥0.\n\nSo at ΔT=0: tail_T=-11, head_T=0, span [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nΔT=1: tail_T=-11+6=-5, head_T=6, span [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nΔT=2: tail_T=-11+12=1, head_T=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for second car, unsafe at ΔT=0 and 1.\n\nNow for freeway 7, unsafe if either car has 0 in span.\n\nFirst car unsafe at ΔT=8,9\n\nSecond car unsafe at ΔT=0,1\n\nSince ΔT=0,1 and ΔT=8,9 are different, so overall unsafe at ΔT=0,1,8,9.\n\nAt other times, safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same as freeway 7, since same cars: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6), so same unsafe times: ΔT=0,1,8,9.\n\nNow, freeway 1 we had unsafe at ΔT=16,17,18,19.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4,5 always safe.\n\nFreeway 6 always safe for T>t1.\n\nt1=72.\n\nPlayer starts at y=0 at t=72.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nEach U increases y by 1, S keeps y, D decreases but not useful here probably.\n\nMinimal turns: if no cars, we could go U each turn from t=72 to t=80, reaching y=9 at t=80? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAt t=72, y=0.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy based on action.\n\nThe turn when we reach y=9.\n\nSuppose at turn T, we are at y_T, and after action, we go to y_{T+1}.\n\nWe reach (0,9) when y_{t} =9 for some t.\n\nSince we start at t=72, y=0.\n\nIf we do U at t=72, y_{73} =1\n\nU at t=73, y_{74}=2\n\n...\n\nU at t=80, y_{81}=9? Let's count.\n\nt=72: y=0\n\nAfter action at t=72: if U, y_{73}=1\n\nAction at t=73: U, y_{74}=2\n\n...\n\nAction at t=79: U, y_{80}=8? Start: t=72, y=0\n\nt=72: action, say U, then y_{73}=1\n\nt=73: action, U, y_{74}=2\n\nt=74: U, y_{75}=3\n\nt=75: U, y_{76}=4\n\nt=76: U, y_{77}=5\n\nt=77: U, y_{78}=6\n\nt=78: U, y_{79}=7\n\nt=79: U, y_{80}=8\n\nt=80: U, y_{81}=9\n\nSo at t=81, y=9.\n\nSince we reach y=9 at turn t=81 after action at t=80.\n\nThe position is at the start of turn, I think.\n\nDefine: at turn t, position is (0, y_t)\n\nThen we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}\n\nThen at turn t+1, we are at (0, y_{t+1}), and so on.\n\nCollision at turn t if on freeway y_t, and for that freeway, 0 in car span at turn t.\n\nGoal: reach y_t =9 for some t.\n\nWhen y_t=9, we are at goal, no action needed? But the sequence is actions to reach.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to specify actions until we reach, but when we reach, we might not need to act, but the turn when we first have y_t=9.\n\nIn the output, we list actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and after H actions, we are at (0,9).\n\nStarting from t_1, after H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nSet t_start = t1 =72.\n\nAt turn t_start, position y=0.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_start + H, position y=9.\n\nThe actions are at turns t_start to t_start + H -1.\n\nAfter H actions, we have moved H steps, so y increased by the number of U minus number of D, but since D not used, net increase equals number of U.\n\nFrom y=0 to y=9, need net +9 in y, so at least 9 U actions, and possibly some S, but S doesn't change y, so minimal H is 9, with all U.\n\nBut we might need to insert S to avoid collisions, increasing H.\n\nNow, we need to check for each step when we are on a freeway, it must be safe.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nWe start at y=0, which is safe.\n\nThen we move to y=1 at some point.\n\nThe time when we are on each y must be safe for that freeway.\n\nFor example, when y_t = k for k=1 to 8, turn t must not be unsafe for freeway k.\n\nNow, let's list the unsafe times for each freeway, in terms of absolute turn T.\n\nt1=72.\n\nUnsafe for:\n\nFreeway 1: at T where ΔT = T-72 =16,17,18,19 so T=72+16=88, 89,90,91\n\nFreeway 2: always safe\n\nFreeway 3: always safe\n\nFreeway 4: always safe\n\nFreeway 5: always safe\n\nFreeway 6: always safe for T>72, as we saw\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe at ΔT=0,1,8,9 so T=72+0=72, 73, 80,81\n\nΔT=0: T=72, ΔT=1: T=73, ΔT=8: T=72+8=80, ΔT=9: T=81\n\nFreeway 8: same, unsafe at T=72,73,80,81\n\nNow, for freeway 7 and 8, at T=72 and 73, unsafe, but at T=72, player is at y=0, not on freeway, so no issue. Similarly T=73, if player is on y=7 or 8, it would be collision, but player might not be there.\n\nSimilarly, T=80 and 81 unsafe for y=7 and y=8.\n\nNow, we need to schedule the path from y=0 to y=9.\n\nMinimal time: start at t=72, y=0.\n\nWe need to be on y=1 at some t, y=2 at some t, ..., y=8 at some t, and then to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nThe critical part is to avoid being on unsafe freeways at unsafe times.\n\nNow, unsafe times per freeway:\n\ny=1: unsafe at T=88,89,90,91\n\ny=2: always safe\n\ny=3: always safe\n\ny=4: always safe\n\ny=5: always safe\n\ny=6: always safe (for T>72)\n\ny=7: unsafe at T=80,81  (since T=72,73 player not on it probably)\n\nT=72 and 73 unsafe, but at T=72, y=0; at T=73, player could be on y=1 if moved up at t=72.\n\nBut y=7 not involved yet.\n\nSimilarly, y=8: unsafe at T=80,81\n\nNow, for y=7 and y=8, unsafe at T=80 and 81.\n\nIn the minimal path, if we go straight up, we would be on y=7 at t=79? Let's see the timeline.\n\nAssume we start moving up at t=72.\n\nt=72: action U, go to y=1 at t=73? At turn t=72, position y=0.\n\nAction a_{72}: if U, then y_{73} =1\n\nSo at turn t=73, position y=1\n\nSimilarly, a_{73}: U, y_{74}=2\n\n...\n\nAt turn t=79, y=7? t=73: y=1\n\nt=74: y=2\n\n...\n\nt=79: y=7 (since 79-73=6, y=1+6=7)\n\nt=73: y=1, t=74: y=2, ..., so at turn t, y_t = (t - 72) ? At t=72, y=0\n\nt=73, y=1 after action at t=72\n\nt=74, y=2 after action at t=73\n\n...\n\nSo at turn t, y_t = t - 72\n\nFor t from 72 to 80: y_t = t - 72\n\nt=72: y=0\n\nt=73: y=1\n\nt=74: y=2\n\n...\n\nt=80: y=8\n\nt=81: y=9\n\nIn this sequence, we are on y=1 at t=73, y=2 at t=74, ..., y=7 at t=79, y=8 at t=80, then to y=9 at t=81.\n\nNow, check for each:\n\nAt t=73, y=1: freeway 1, unsafe times T=88,89,90,91, t=73 not in, so safe.\n\ny=2 at t=74: always safe.\n\nSimilarly y=3,4,5,6 all safe at those times.\n\ny=7 at t=79: freeway 7, unsafe at T=80,81? T=80 and 81.\n\nt=79 not unsafe for y=7.\n\nUnsafe for y=7 at T=80,81.\n\nAt t=79, y=7, which is before T=80, so safe.\n\nThen at t=80, y=8: freeway 8, unsafe at T=80,81.\n\nT=80 is unsafe for y=8.\n\nIn this sequence, at t=80, y=8, and T=80 is unsafe for freeway 8.\n\nCollision!\n\nBecause at turn t=80, position y=8, and for freeway 8, at T=80, it is unsafe, as per above.\n\nSimilarly, at t=81, y=9, but y=9 no freeway, safe.\n\nBut at t=80, on y=8, unsafe.\n\nSo collision at t=80.\n\nTherefore, cannot be on y=8 at t=80.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at t=80 would be unsafe, but in this path, at t=80 we are on y=8.\n\nIn the direct path, we are on y=8 at t=80, which is unsafe.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at t=80 or t=81.\n\ny=7 unsafe at t=80,81\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=80,81\n\nAlso, for y=1, unsafe later at t=88-91, but that is far, not relevant for minimal path.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, we need to be on y=8 at some point before, and then move up.\n\nBut at t=80 and 81, y=8 is unsafe, so we cannot be on y=8 at those turns.\n\nSimilarly for y=7.\n\nIn the minimal time, we would be on y=7 at t=79, which is safe, then at t=80, if we go U, we go to y=8 at t=81? Action at t=80.\n\nAt turn t=79, position y=7.\n\nAction a_{79}: if U, then y_{80} =8\n\nThen at turn t=80, position y=8.\n\nBut t=80, y=8 is unsafe.\n\nIf we do S at t=79, then y_{80} =7, so at t=80, position y=7.\n\nBut at t=80, y=7 is also unsafe, since freeway 7 unsafe at T=80.\n\nThen collision.\n\nIf we do D, but y=7, D to y=6, then at t=80, y=6, which is safe, but we go down, not good.\n\nWe need to delay being on y=7 or y=8 until after t=81.\n\nt=81 is unsafe for y=7 and y=8, so we need to be on y=7 or y=8 only at t <=79 or t>=82.\n\nt=79: y=7 is safe, as before.\n\nt=80 and t=81 unsafe for both y=7 and y=8.\n\nt=82: for y=7, at t=82, ΔT=82-72=10, for freeway 7, earlier we had safe for ΔT=10, since ΔT=8,9 unsafe, ΔT=10 safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8 same.\n\nSo safe at t=82 and after.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9.\n\nOne way: we can be on y=7 at t=79, which is safe.\n\nThen, instead of moving up at t=79, we can stay or move down to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at t=80 and t=81.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nSince y=6 is always safe, we can stay on y=6 during t=80 and t=81, then move up.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt t=79, y=7.\n\nInstead of U, we do D to go back to y=6 at t=80.\n\nThen at t=80, position y=6, which is safe.\n\nThen at t=80, action: we can S to stay y=6, or U to y=7.\n\nBut at t=80, if we go to y=7, at t=81 position y=7, but t=81 unsafe for y=7.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=8 at t=81, unsafe.\n\nSo better to stay on y=6 at t=80.\n\nAction at t=80: S or D.\n\nIf S, y_{81} =6, so at t=81, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=81, we can move.\n\nBut we need to go up.\n\nNow, at t=81, position y=6.\n\nAction: U to y=7 at t=82.\n\nThen at t=82, position y=7, which is safe, since t=82>81.\n\nThen U to y=8 at t=83, safe.\n\nThen U to y=9 at t=84.\n\nBut we reached y=9 at t=84, which is later than minimal 81.\n\nt=84 vs t=81, so 3 extra turns.\n\nBut we might do better.\n\nAnother idea: since y=2,3,4,5 are always safe, we can slow down earlier to avoid being at high y at critical times.\n\nFor example, if we insert some S actions earlier.\n\nMinimal H: if we go straight, H=9 actions to reach y=9 at t=81, but collision at t=80.\n\nTo avoid, we need to not be on y=8 at t=80 or y=7 at t=80 or t=81.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=79, we are on y=7, safe.\n\nWe need to ensure that at t=80, we are not on y=7 or y=8.\n\nSimilarly at t=81.\n\nSo from t=79 y=7, we must go down or stay, but stay keeps y=7, which at t=80 is unsafe.\n\nSo only option is to go down to y=6 at t=80.\n\nThen at t=80, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=80, we can go to y=7 or stay or down.\n\nIf we go to y=7 at t=81, unsafe.\n\nSo we must not go to y=7 or y=8 at t=81.\n\nSo at t=80, after being at y=6, we can S to stay at y=6 for t=81, or D to y=5.\n\nBut y=5 safe, but going down not efficient.\n\nSo stay at y=6 at t=81.\n\nThen at t=81, position y=6, safe.\n\nThen we can go U to y=7 at t=82, safe.\n\nThen U to y=8 at t=83, safe.\n\nU to y=9 at t=84.\n\nAs before.\n\nFrom t=79, go D to y=6 at t=80.\n\nThen S at t=80 to stay y=6 at t=81.\n\nThen U at t=81 to y=7 at t=82.\n\nU at t=82 to y=8 at t=83.\n\nU at t=83 to y=9 at t=84.\n\nSo actions: at t=79: D, t=80: S, t=81: U, t=82: U, t=83: U.\n\nBut we start from t=72.\n\nFirst, from t=72 to t=78: we can go U each turn to reach y=7 at t=79.\n\nt=72: U to y=1 at t=73\n\n...\n\nt=78: U to y=7? At t=78, position y=?\n\nt=72: y=0\n\nt=73: y=1 (after U at t=72)\n\n...\n\nt=78: y=6? t=73:y=1, t=74:y=2, ..., so t=78: y=78-72? t=72:y=0, t=73:y=1, so t=t, y=t-72.\n\nt=78: y=6\n\nThen action at t=78: U to y=7 at t=79.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the critical part:\n\nAt t=78, position y=6.\n\nAction a_{78}: U, so y_{79} =7, position at t=79 is y=7.\n\nThen at t=79, action: instead of U, we do D, so y_{80} =7 -1 =6.\n\nThen at t=80, position y=6.\n\nAction at t=80: S, so y_{81} =6, position at t=81 is y=6.\n\nThen action at t=81: U, y_{82} =7, position t=82 y=7.\n\nAction at t=82: U, y_{83}=8, position t=83 y=8.\n\nAction at t=83: U, y_{84}=9, position t=84 y=9.\n\nNow, we reached at t=84.\n\nTotal actions from t=72 to t=83: t=72 to t=83 is 12 actions? Turns: actions at t=72 to t=83, that's 12 actions, but H is the number of actions.\n\nStart at t=72, after H actions, at t=72+H, y=9.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at t=72, y=0.\n\nAfter 1 action, at t=73, y= something.\n\nWe need y_{72+H} =9.\n\nIn above, at t=84, y=9, so 72+H=84, H=12.\n\nMinimal is 9, so 12 is more.\n\nBut we inserted extra actions.\n\nWe might not need to go down, but stay at lower levels.\n\nFor example, if we reach y=7 later.\n\ny=7 at t=79 is safe, but then we have to leave before t=80.\n\nSince we can stay at y=6, which is safe always.\n\nAnother idea: reach y=6 earlier and stay there during t=80 and t=81.\n\nFor example, from start, go up to y=6 quickly.\n\ny=6 is freeway 6, always safe.\n\nAt t=72, y=0.\n\nIf we do U each turn: at t=73 y=1, t=74 y=2, ..., t=77 y=5? t=73:y=1, t=74:y=2, t=75:y=3, t=76:y=4, t=77:y=5, t=78:y=6.\n\nSo at t=78, y=6.\n\nNow, we can stay at y=6 for a while.\n\nAt t=78, position y=6.\n\nAction at t=78: S, then y_{79}=6, position t=79 y=6.\n\nAction at t=79: S, y_{80}=6, position t=80 y=6.\n\nAction at t=80: S, y_{81}=6, position t=81 y=6.\n\nNow, t=80 and t=81, we are on y=6, safe.\n\nThen after t=81, we can go up.\n\nAction at t=81: U, y_{82}=7, position t=82 y=7.\n\nAction at t=82: U, y_{83}=8, position t=83 y=8.\n\nAction at t=83: U, y_{84}=9, position t=84 y=9.\n\nSame as before, reached at t=84 with H=12 actions? Actions from t=72 to t=83: 12 actions, t=72 to t=83 inclusive is 12 turns? t=72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83: that's 12 actions, to reach at t=84.\n\nBut from t=72 to t=83 is 12 actions, after 12 actions, at t=84.\n\nBut minimal is 9, so H=12.\n\nBut we might start later or something.\n\nSince y=2,3,4,5 are safe, we can slow down there.\n\nBut to save time, we should go up as fast as possible except when necessary to wait.\n\nThe critical period is t=80 and t=81, unsafe for y=7 and y=8.\n\nWe need to not be on y=7 or y=8 at t=80 and t=81.\n\nAlso, we need to pass through y=7 and y=8 at safe times.\n\ny=7 safe except t=80,81\n\nSimilarly y=8 except t=80,81\n\nSo we can be on y=7 at t=79 or t=82, etc.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nIn the direct path, we are on y=7 at t=79 (safe), then at t=80 we would go to y=8, but at t=80 we are on y=8 which is unsafe.\n\nInstead, at t=79, we can stay at y=7, but at t=80, position y=7, unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nGo down to y=6 at t=80.\n\nThen we are safe at y=6.\n\nBut then we have to go up later.\n\nTo minimize delay, we should reach y=7 as late as possible before the unsafe period or as early after.\n\nSince we can be on y=7 at t=79 (safe), and then we must leave to a safe y before t=80.\n\ny=6 is safe at t=80.\n\nSo go down to y=6 at t=80.\n\nThen at t=80, we are on y=6, safe.\n\nThen we can stay or move.\n\nBut to go up, at t=80, if we go U to y=7 at t=81, but t=81 y=7 is unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot go to y=7 or y=8 at t=81.\n\nSo at t=80, we must not go to y=7; we can only S or D to stay at y=6 or go down.\n\nThen at t=81, position y=6, safe, then go U to y=7 at t=82.\n\nSo inevitably, we have a delay of 2 turns: we waste t=80 and t=81 at y=6, then go up at t=82,83,84.\n\nFrom t=79 y=7, we go D to y=6 at t=80, then S at t=80 to y=6 at t=81? Action at t=80: if S, y_{81}=6, position t=81 y=6.\n\nThen at t=81, U to y_{82}=7.\n\nSo we have two actions: D at t=79 and S at t=80, but S at t=80 is to keep y=6, but we could have gone directly to U at t=81 from y=6, but we are at y=6 at t=81.\n\nThe point is, from t=79 to t=82, we are not progressing.\n\nTo reach y=7 at t=82 instead of t=79, but that might not save time.\n\nSuppose we slow down earlier.\n\nFor example, at some point before, we insert a S to delay.\n\nSuppose we want to be on y=7 at t=82.\n\nt=82 is safe for y=7.\n\nThen we can go U to y=8 at t=83, safe, U to y=9 at t=84.\n\nNow, to be on y=7 at t=82, we need to reach y=7 at turn t=82.\n\nThat means at t=82, position y=7.\n\nWhich means after action at t=81, y_{82}=7.\n\nSo action at t=81 must be U from y=6 or S from y=7, but to be at y=7.\n\nNow, to have y=6 at t=81 or something.\n\nFrom start, we need to arrive at y=7 at t=82.\n\nSo the time to go from y=0 to y=7.\n\nMinimal time is 7 actions: from t=72, U at t=72 to y=1 at t=73, ..., U at t=78 to y=6 at t=79? Let's see.\n\nTo be at y=7 at turn t.\n\nAt turn t, y_t =7.\n\nThis is after actions from t=72 to t-1.\n\nNumber of U actions determines y.\n\nFrom y=0 at t=72, to y=7 at turn T, we need exactly 7 U actions, and the number of S or D actions adds delay.\n\nThe turn when we reach y=7 is at least t=79 with all U.\n\nIf we insert S, it takes more turns.\n\nFor example, to be at y=7 at t=82, that means we have spent 10 turns to go from t=72 to t=82? From start to turn t=82, position y=7.\n\nThe time elapsed is (82 - 72) = 10 turns, but at t=72, y=0, after 10 actions, at t=82 y= something.\n\nWith k U actions, y = k, since no D.\n\nSo if y=7 at t=82, that means after 10 actions, y=7, so we have 7 U and 3 S actions, for example.\n\nSimilarly, to reach at t=84 y=9, with 12 actions, 9 U and 3 S or something.\n\nBut in our case, to be at y=7 at t=82, we can have actions with 7 U and 3 S in 10 actions.\n\nThen from there, U at t=82 to y=8 at t=83, U at t=83 to y=9 at t=84.\n\nTotal to y=9 at t=84.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf we go faster to y=6 and stay, we also reach at t=84.\n\nNow, can we reach earlier?\n\nt=83 y=9?\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=83, that means position at t=83 is y=9.\n\nSo after actions from t=72 to t=82, 11 actions? Actions at t=72 to t=82, 11 actions, to reach y=9 at t=83.\n\nWith 9 U and 2 S, for example.\n\nBut we need to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nAt t=80 and t=81, we need to not be on y=7 or y=8.\n\nSo possible positions at t=80 and t=81 must be <=6 or 9, but y=9 not yet.\n\ny<=6.\n\nSimilarly, at t=82, we can be on y=7 or y=8.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 at t=83, we need to be at y=8 at t=82 or something.\n\nAt turn t=82, position y must be 8, so that after U at t=82, y_{83}=9.\n\ny_{83}=9 means at turn t=83 position y=9.\n\nWhich is after action at t=82.\n\nSo at t=82, position y=8, then action U, y_{83}=9.\n\nSimilarly, at t=82, y=8 must be safe.\n\nt=82, ΔT=82-72=10, for y=8, freeway 8, at ΔT=10, safe, as earlier.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=8 at t=82.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=8 at t=82 with the path avoiding being on y=7 or y=8 at t=80 and t=81.\n\nAt t=80 and t=81, we must be on y<=6.\n\ny=6 is safe.\n\nNow, from start to t=82 y=8.\n\nMinimal time to y=8 is 8 actions, reaching at t=80 y=8.\n\nBut at t=80 y=8 unsafe.\n\nSo we need to delay.\n\nTo be at y=8 at t=82, we can have 8 U actions and some S actions in the 10 actions from t=72 to t=81? Actions from t=72 to t=81 determine y at t=82.\n\nLet's think of the state at each turn.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nConstraints:\n\n- At t=80, y_{80} <=6\n\n- At t=81, y_{81} <=6\n\n- At t=82, y_{82} =8 (to reach y=9 at t=83)\n\nThen y_{83}=9 after U at t=82.\n\ny_{82}=8.\n\nNow, from y_{81} <=6 to y_{82}=8.\n\ny_{82} = y_{81} + Δy, where Δy = -1,0,1.\n\nIf y_{81} <=6, and y_{82}=8, then Δy must be +2, but Δy can only be -1,0,1, impossible.\n\ny_{82} = y_{81} + Δy_{81}, so |y_{82} - y_{81}| <=1.\n\nSo if y_{81} <=6, y_{82} <=7.\n\nBut we need y_{82}=8, which requires y_{81} >=7, but y_{81} <=6, contradiction.\n\nTherefore, impossible to have y_{82}=8 if y_{81} <=6.\n\nSimilarly, if y_{81} <=6, y_{82} <=7.\n\nBut y=8 requires y_{82} >=7 and then action U.\n\nBut y_{82} <=7 if y_{81} <=6.\n\ny_{82} <= y_{81} +1 <=7.\n\nSo y_{82} <=7, cannot be 8.\n\nTherefore, to have y_{82}=8, we must have y_{81} >=7.\n\nBut at t=81, y_{81} <=6 to avoid collision, since if y_{81}=7 or 8, unsafe.\n\nt=81, if y_{81}=7 or 8, collision.\n\nBut y_{81} <=6 to be safe.\n\nBut to have y_{82}=8, we need y_{81} >=7.\n\nContradiction.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to reach y=9 at t=83.\n\nSimilarly, at t=82, if we want y_{82}=8, but at t=81, we must have y_{81} <=6, so y_{82} <=7.\n\nThen at t=82, y_{82} <=7, then we can go to y_{83}=8 or 9, etc.\n\nBut not to 9 directly.\n\nEarliest possible: after t=81, we can be at y=6, then at t=81, U to y=7 at t=82, then U to y=8 at t=83, U to y=9 at t=84.\n\nOr, if at t=81, we are at y=7, but cannot, because unsafe.\n\nSo only from y=6 at t=81 to y=7 at t=82.\n\nThen y=8 at t=83, y=9 at t=84.\n\nThus, minimal reach time is t=84.\n\nWith H=12 actions.\n\nNow, to have y=6 at t=81, for example.\n\nWe can reach y=6 earlier.\n\nFor instance, as before: go U from t=72 to t=77: let's list actions.\n\nStart: t=72, position y=0\n\nAction a_72: U, y_{73}=1\n\nt=73, y=1, action U, y_{74}=2\n\nt=74, y=2, U, y_{75}=3\n\nt=75, y=3, U, y_{76}=4\n\nt=76, y=4, U, y_{77}=5\n\nt=77, y=5, U, y_{78}=6\n\nt=78, y=6, action: we need to be at y<=6 at t=80 and t=81.\n\nAt t=78, y=6.\n\nWe can S to stay at y=6.\n\nAction a_78: S, then y_{79}=6, position t=79 y=6\n\nThen a_79: S, y_{80}=6, position t=80 y=6\n\na_80: S, y_{81}=6, position t=81 y=6\n\nNow, at t=81, y=6, safe.\n\nThen a_81: U, y_{82}=7, position t=82 y=7\n\na_82: U, y_{83}=8, position t=83 y=8\n\na_83: U, y_{84}=9, position t=84 y=9\n\nNow, actions from t=72 to t=83: that's 12 actions.\n\nBut at t=78, we did S, but we could have done U to go to y=7 at t=79, then D to y=6 at t=80, etc., but that might not save actions.\n\nIn the above, we have three S actions at t=78,79,80.\n\nBut we only need to be safe at t=80 and t=81, so we can use fewer S if we reach later.\n\nFor example, to be at y=6 at t=80 and t=81.\n\nWe can reach y=6 at t=78, as above.\n\nThen at t=78, if we do S, we stay at y=6 for t=79.\n\nBut at t=79, y=6 is fine, but we don't need to avoid t=79, only t=80 and t=81.\n\nAt t=79, we can be on y=7, which is safe.\n\nThen from y=7 at t=79, go D to y=6 at t=80.\n\nThen at t=80, y=6, S to y=6 at t=81.\n\nThen U to y=7 at t=82, etc.\n\nIn this case, actions:\n\nt=72 to t=77: U each, to reach y=6 at t=78? t=72 U to y1 t73, ..., t=77: at t=77 position y=5 (since t=73 y1, t=74 y2, t=75 y3, t=76 y4, t=77 y5)\n\nt=77 position y=5, action U, y_{78}=6, position t=78 y=6\n\nt=78 position y=6, action U, y_{79}=7, position t=79 y=7\n\nNow, at t=79, y=7, safe.\n\nAction a_79: D, so y_{80}=7-1=6, position t=80 y=6\n\nThen a_80: S, y_{81}=6, position t=81 y=6\n\na_81: U, y_{82}=7, position t=82 y=7\n\na_82: U, y_{83}=8, position t=83 y=8\n\na_83: U, y_{84}=9, position t=84 y=9\n\nNow, actions: t=72 to t=77: U (6 actions: t72 to t77)\n\nt=78: U\n\nt=79: D\n\nt=80: S\n\nt=81: U\n\nt=82: U\n\nt=83: U\n\nThat's from t=72 to t=83, 12 actions, same as before.\n\nBut we have a D action, which is inefficient, but same number.\n\nCompared to staying at y=6: in the stay version, we had S at t=78,79,80, and U at t=81,82,83.\n\nHere we have U at t=78, D at t=79, S at t=80, U at t=81,82,83.\n\nSo one more U and one D, net same, but D might not be necessary.\n\nTo save one action, but we need to reach y=9 with fewer delays.\n\nSince y=1 to 5 are always safe, we can be there during t=80,81.\n\nFor example, at t=80, be at y=5 or less.\n\nBut then it takes longer to go up.\n\nFor instance, suppose at t=80, y_{80}=5.\n\nThen to reach y=9, need to go up 4 more steps, so at least t=84.\n\nSimilarly, if y_{81}=5, then to y=9 at t=85 or later.\n\nNot better.\n\nMaximal progress: be at y=6 at t=81.\n\nThen from there, U to y=7 at t=82, etc., to y=9 at t=84.\n\nTo be at y=6 at t=81.\n\ny_{81}=6.\n\nThis requires that from start, with 9 actions? From t=72 to t=80, 9 actions, to y_{81}=6.\n\nSince y=0 at t=72, after 9 actions, y=6, so we have 6 U and 3 S, for example.\n\nThen at t=81, y=6, U to y=7 at t=82, U to y=8 at t=83, U to y=9 at t=84.\n\nActions from t=72 to t=83: 12 actions, same as before.\n\nWe can have fewer S if we reach faster.\n\nFor example, go up fast to y=6 by t=78 with all U: actions t=72 to t=77: U, to y=6 at t=78? t=72 U to y1 t73, ..., t=77: position y=5, action U at t=77, y_{78}=6.\n\nSo at t=78, y=6.\n\nThen we need to be at y=6 at t=81.\n\nSo from t=78 to t=81, we need y_{81}=6.\n\nAt t=78, y=6.\n\nAction a_78: if S, y_{79}=6, position t=79 y=6\n\na_79: S, y_{80}=6, position t=80 y=6\n\na_80: S, y_{81}=6, position t=81 y=6\n\nThen a_81: U, etc.\n\nBut we have S at t=78,79,80.\n\nIf we do nothing, we stay.\n\nBut we can move to other y, but no need.\n\nSince y=6 is safe, we can stay.\n\nBut to save time, if we go up to y=7 at t=79, then down to y=6 at t=80, but that doesn't save actions; it uses an extra U and D.\n\nIn terms of time to reach y=9, it's the same.\n\nSo minimal H is 12, with y=9 at t=84.\n\nNow, about the cars, we also have freeway 1 unsafe at t=88-91, but since we reach before that, no issue.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways safe.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we need to output actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1=72, H=12, so actions from t=72 to t=72+11=83.\n\nNow, we can choose any sequence that avoids the collisions.\n\nFor example, one way: go straight up to y=6, stay during critical time, then up.\n\nSo:\n\nt=72: U  // to y=1 at t=73\n\nt=73: U  // y=2 at t=74\n\nt=74: U  // y=3 at t=75\n\nt=75: U  // y=4 at t=76\n\nt=76: U  // y=5 at t=77\n\nt=77: U  // y=6 at t=78\n\nt=78: S  // stay y=6 at t=79\n\nt=79: S  // stay y=6 at t=80\n\nt=80: S  // stay y=6 at t=81\n\nt=81: U  // to y=7 at t=82\n\nt=82: U  // to y=8 at t=83\n\nt=83: U  // to y=9 at t=84\n\nIn this, at t=79, position y=6, safe.\n\nt=80, y=6, safe.\n\nt=81, y=6, safe.\n\nThen U to y=7 at t=82, safe.\n\netc.\n\nNo collision.\n\nWith the other sequence: go to y=7 then down.\n\nt=72: U\n\nt=73: U\n\nt=74: U\n\nt=75: U\n\nt=76: U\n\nt=77: U  // to y=6 at t=78? t=77: after U, y_{78}=6, position t=78 y=6\n\nt=78: U  // to y=7 at t=79, position t=79 y=7\n\nt=79: D  // to y=6 at t=80, position t=80 y=6\n\nt=80: S  // to y=6 at t=81, position t=81 y=6\n\nt=81: U  // to y=7 at t=82\n\nt=82: U  // to y=8 at t=83\n\nt=83: U  // to y=9 at t=84\n\nSame number of actions.\n\nBut in this case, at t=79, we did D, which might be less efficient, but same H.\n\nNow, for the output, we need minimal H, which is 12.\n\nBut is there a way with H=11?\n\nSuppose H=11, then at t=72+11=83, y=9.\n\nSo after 11 actions, at t=83, y=9.\n\nThat means y_{83}=9.\n\nWhich requires that at t=82, position y=8 or 9, but if y=9, already there, but we need to reach, so probably y=8 at t=82, then U to y=9.\n\nSo y_{82}=8.\n\nNow, actions from t=72 to t=81 determine y_{82}.\n\nWith 10 actions (t=72 to t=81), to y_{82}=8.\n\nNeed 8 U and 2 S, for example.\n\nNow, constraints: at t=80, y_{80} must not be 7 or 8, so y_{80} <=6.\n\nAt t=81, y_{81} must not be 7 or 8, so y_{81} <=6.\n\nNow, y_{82} = y_{81} + Δy_{81}\n\nSince y_{81} <=6, y_{82} <=7.\n\nBut we need y_{82}=8, which is impossible because y_{82} <=7 <8.\n\nTherefore, cannot have y_{82}=8 with y_{81}<=6.\n\nThus, impossible to reach y=9 at t=83 with H=11.\n\nSimilarly for earlier.\n\nThus minimal H is 12.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we can output one.\n\nIn the answer, we need to list actions for each turn.\n\nAlso, in the car state, freeway 6 has two cars, but we didn't use it in a way that matters.\n\nIn our path, we are on y=6 at some points, but freeway 6 is always safe after t=72.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nt_1=72.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 72: U\n\nTurn 73: U\n\nTurn 74: U\n\nTurn 75: U\n\nTurn 76: U\n\nTurn 77: U\n\nTurn 78: S  // or in the second sequence U, but let's use the first with all U to y=6 then S.\n\nIn the first sequence:\n\nTurn 72: U  // after, y=1 at t=73\n\nTurn 73: U  // y=2 at t=74\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 77: U  // at t=77 position y=5, after U, y_{78}=6\n\nThen turn 78: S  // y_{79}=6, position t=79 y=6\n\nTurn 79: S  // y_{80}=6, position t=80 y=6\n\nTurn 80: S  // y_{81}=6, position t=81 y=6\n\nTurn 81: U  // y_{82}=7, position t=82 y=7\n\nTurn 82: U  // y_{83}=8, position t=83 y=8\n\nTurn 83: U  // y_{84}=9, position t=84 y=9\n\nH=12 actions, from turn 72 to 83.\n\nt=72 to t=83, that's 12 turns.\n\nIn the sequence, actions at t=72 to t=83.\n\nIn the output, it should be for t_1 to t_1 + H -1, which is 72 to 72+11=83.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, to confirm no collision.\n\nAt t=79: y=6, freeway 6, safe.\n\nt=80: y=6, freeway 6, safe.\n\nt=81: y=6, freeway 6, safe.\n\nt=82: y=7, freeway 7, t=82, ΔT=10, safe as per earlier.\n\nt=83: y=8, freeway 8, ΔT=11, similarly safe, since unsafe only at ΔT=8,9.\n\nΔT=11: for y=8, cars: tail_T = -59 +6*11 = -59+66=7, head_T=-48+66=18, span [7,18], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: tail_T=-11+66=55, head_T=66, span [55,66], 0 not in.\n\nSafe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 12.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 72\\) is 12. This sequence avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by staying at \\(y = 6\\) during the unsafe turns \\(t = 80\\) and \\(t = 81\\) for freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\), and then proceeding upward.\n\nThe unsafe times for each freeway are:\n- Freeway 1: Unsafe at turns 88, 89, 90, 91 (not relevant as the goal is reached earlier).\n- Freeway 2, 3, 4, 5: Always safe.\n- Freeway 6: Always safe for \\(T > 72\\).\n- Freeway 7: Unsafe at turns 72, 73, 80, 81. At turns 72 and 73, the player is not on freeway 7, so only turns 80 and 81 are critical.\n- Freeway 8: Unsafe at turns 72, 73, 80, 81. Similarly, only turns 80 and 81 are critical.\n\nThe sequence of actions minimizes \\(H\\) by:\n- Moving up directly to \\(y = 6\\) by turn 78.\n- Staying at \\(y = 6\\) for turns 79, 80, and 81 to avoid being on \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) at unsafe turns 80 and 81.\n- Moving up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 82, \\(y = 8\\) at turn 83, and \\(y = 9\\) at turn 84.\n\nActions:\n- Turn 72: Move up (U) to reach \\(y = 1\\) at turn 73.\n- Turn 73: Move up (U) to reach \\(y = 2\\) at turn 74.\n- Turn 74: Move up (U) to reach \\(y = 3\\) at turn 75.\n- Turn 75: Move up (U) to reach \\(y = 4\\) at turn 76.\n- Turn 76: Move up (U) to reach \\(y = 5\\) at turn 77.\n- Turn 77: Move up (U) to reach \\(y = 6\\) at turn 78.\n- Turn 78: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 6\\) at turn 79.\n- Turn 79: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 6\\) at turn 80.\n- Turn 80: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 6\\) at turn 81.\n- Turn 81: Move up (U) to reach \\(y = 7\\) at turn 82.\n- Turn 82: Move up (U) to reach \\(y = 8\\) at turn 83.\n- Turn 83: Move up (U) to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 84.\n\nAfter 12 actions (from turn 72 to turn 83), the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 84. No collisions occur, as verified by the car positions and collision rules.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 72: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 73: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 74: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 75: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 76: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 77: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 78: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 79: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 80: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 81: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 82: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 83: U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0 respectively, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y_T at that turn, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The span moves based on direction and speed.\n\nImportant note: when you move to a new y-position, you are not on that new freeway until the next turn. So if at turn T you move from y_T to y_{T+1}, at turn T you are still on y_T, and only on y_{T+1} at turn T+1. So for collision, at turn T, we care about cars on freeway y_T only.\n\nThe car states are given for turn t_1=74. For each freeway, there are cars with head, tail, direction, and speed. I need to compute where these cars will be at future turns relative to t_1.\n\nLet t be the turn number, and let Δt = t - t_1 = t - 74. So at time t, the car positions are offset by Δt.\n\nFor left-moving cars (but in the table, direction is given as \"right\" or \"left\"? Let me check.\n\nIn the car state table, all directions are \"right\" except... looking:\n\nFreeway 1: (-42, -53, right, 3) — direction right.\n\nAll cars seem to be right-moving? Freeway 6 has two cars, both right. Freeway 7 and 8 also right. But direction is specified: for example, freeway 1: right, freeway 2: right, etc. I see no left-moving cars here. All are right-moving.\n\nConfirm:\n\n| Freeway k | Cars |\n\n1: (-42, -53, right, 3) — so head at -42, tail at -53? But for right-moving, head should be greater than tail? Typically, for right-moving, head is the front, so if moving right, head should be larger than tail.\n\nIn the span: for right-moving, [τ, h] with τ < h, I think? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFrom the problem: for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] and at T, [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: [h, τ] to [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt]\n\nIn the car state given, for freeway 1: (-42, -53, right, 3)\n\n-42 and -53, -42 > -53, so if right-moving, head should be larger, so here h = -42, τ = -53? But in the tuple it's (head, tail, direction, speed), so head = -42, tail = -53 for right direction.\n\nBut for right-moving, with head at -42, tail at -53, since -42 > -53, and it's moving right, so at time t, position increases.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 6: (-48, -59, right, 12) and (24, 13, right, 12) — for the second car, head=24, tail=13, since 24>13.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 7: (-36, -47, right, 6) and (12, 1, right, 6) — head=12, tail=1 for second car? 12>1, yes.\n\nAll cars are right-moving, so I don't need to worry about left-moving for this instance.\n\nNow, collision condition: at turn t, if player is on freeway y_t, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] for some car on that freeway.\n\nSince all right-moving, span at time t is [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt], and 0 in that interval.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=2 at t=74.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns would be at least 7, since from y=2 to y=9, difference is 7, and each U move increases by 1, so if I go up every turn, I can reach in 7 turns, but I might have to avoid cars, so I might need to stay or move down sometimes, which could increase H.\n\nBut since I want minimal H, I should try to go up as much as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nNow, let's list the freeways and their cars, and for each, find when 0 is in the span, meaning when collision happens if player is on that freeway.\n\nFirst, define Δt = t - 74.\n\nFor each freeway, for each car, the span at time t is [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] for right-moving cars.\n\nCollision on freeway k at time t if min(τ + s Δt, h + s Δt) <= 0 <= max(τ + s Δt, h + s Δt), but since h > τ for right-moving, it's τ + s Δt <= 0 <= h + s Δt.\n\nSince h > τ, the span is from smaller to larger: τ + s Δt to h + s Δt.\n\nSo 0 is in [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] if τ + s Δt <= 0 <= h + s Δt.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway when this happens.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: cars: only one car: head h=-42, tail τ=-53, speed s=3, direction right.\n\nSo span at t: [ -53 + 3 Δt, -42 + 3 Δt ]\n\n0 in span if -53 + 3 Δt <= 0 <= -42 + 3 Δt\n\nWhich is -53 + 3 Δt <= 0 and 0 <= -42 + 3 Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -53 + 3 Δt <= 0 => 3 Δt <= 53 => Δt <= 53/3 ≈ 17.666, so Δt <= 17 since integer? Δt is integer, turns are discrete.\n\nΔt = t - 74, integer.\n\nSo -53 + 3 Δt <= 0 => 3 Δt <= 53 => Δt <= 17.666, so since Δt integer, Δt <= 17\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -42 + 3 Δt => 42 <= 3 Δt => Δt >= 42/3 = 14\n\nSo for Δt from 14 to 17 inclusive, collision on freeway 1.\n\nΔt=14: -53 + 3*14 = -53 + 42 = -11 <=0, -42 + 42=0 <=0, yes 0 in [-11,0]\n\n-42 + 3*14 = -42 + 42 =0, so [ -11, 0], 0 included.\n\nΔt=15: -53+45= -8, -42+45=3, so [-8,3], 0 in it.\n\nΔt=16: -53+48= -5, -42+48=6, [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nΔt=17: -53+51= -2, -42+51=9, [-2,9], 0 in.\n\nΔt=18: -53+54=1, -42+54=12, [1,12], 0 not <=1? 0 <1, not in.\n\nSimilarly, Δt=13: -53+39= -14, -42+39= -3, [-14,-3], 0 not in.\n\nSo collision on freeway 1 when Δt = 14,15,16,17.\n\nNow, freeway 2: cars: one car (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nh=-48? Head -48, tail -59, s=12.\n\nSpan: [ -59 + 12 Δt, -48 + 12 Δt ]\n\n0 in if -59 + 12 Δt <= 0 <= -48 + 12 Δt\n\nFirst: -59 + 12 Δt <= 0 => 12 Δt <= 59 => Δt <= 59/12 ≈ 4.916, so Δt <= 4\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 + 12 Δt => 48 <= 12 Δt => Δt >= 4\n\nSo Δt >=4 and Δt <=4, so only at Δt=4.\n\nCheck: Δt=4: -59 + 48 = -11, -48 + 48 =0, so [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nΔt=3: -59+36= -23, -48+36= -12, [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nΔt=5: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo collision on freeway 2 only at Δt=4.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? Cars: (-48, -59, right, 12) identical to freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 3: \"(-48, -59, right, 12)\" same as freeway 2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same.\n\nFreeway 5: same.\n\nAll freeways 2,3,4,5 have the same single car: (-48, -59, right, 12), so each will have collision only at Δt=4.\n\nBut since they are different freeways, we care per freeway.\n\nNow freeway 6: has two cars: (-48, -59, right, 12) and (24, 13, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: same as above, collision at Δt=4.\n\nSecond car: head h=24, tail τ=13, s=12, right.\n\nSpan: [13 + 12 Δt, 24 + 12 Δt]\n\n0 in if 13 + 12 Δt <= 0 <= 24 + 12 Δt\n\nBut 13 + 12 Δt <=0? Since 13>0 and Δt>=0, 13 +12Δt >=13>0, so never <=0. Thus, 0 cannot be <= min, so never in the span. Similarly, 0 <= 24 +12 Δt always true for Δt>=0, but since lower bound positive, 0 not in interval.\n\nSo for second car, no collision ever.\n\nThus for freeway 6, collision only when first car causes it, at Δt=4.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: cars: (-36, -47, right, 6) and (12, 1, right, 6)\n\nFirst car: h=-36? Head -36, tail -47, s=6, right.\n\nSpan: [ -47 + 6 Δt, -36 + 6 Δt ]\n\n0 in if -47 + 6 Δt <= 0 <= -36 + 6 Δt\n\nFirst: -47 + 6 Δt <= 0 => 6 Δt <= 47 => Δt <= 47/6 ≈ 7.833, so Δt <=7\n\nSecond: 0 <= -36 + 6 Δt => 36 <= 6 Δt => Δt >=6\n\nSo Δt from 6 to 7 inclusive.\n\nΔt=6: -47+36= -11, -36+36=0, [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nΔt=7: -47+42= -5, -36+42=6, [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nΔt=5: -47+30= -17, -36+30= -6, [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nΔt=8: -47+48=1, -36+48=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nNow second car on freeway 7: (12, 1, right, 6) — head=12, tail=1, s=6.\n\nSpan: [1 + 6 Δt, 12 + 6 Δt]\n\n0 in if 1 + 6 Δt <= 0 <= 12 + 6 Δt\n\nBut 1 + 6 Δt >=1>0 for Δt>=0, so never <=0, thus 0 not in span. No collision.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same as freeway 7? Cars: (-36, -47, right, 6) and (12, 1, right, 6) identical.\n\nSo same as freeway 7: collision at Δt=6 and Δt=7 for the first car.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway when collision happens (if player is on that freeway at that turn):\n\n- Freeway 1: Δt = 14,15,16,17\n\n- Freeway 2: Δt = 4\n\n- Freeway 3: Δt = 4  (since same car)\n\n- Freeway 4: Δt = 4\n\n- Freeway 5: Δt = 4\n\n- Freeway 6: Δt = 4  (from first car; second car no issue)\n\n- Freeway 7: Δt = 6,7\n\n- Freeway 8: Δt = 6,7\n\nNote that freeways 2,3,4,5,6 all have collision only at Δt=4.\n\nFreeway 6 has collision at Δt=4, same as others.\n\nNow, player starts at y=2 at Δt=0 (t=74).\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe path is a sequence of actions: U, D, S, changing y.\n\ny must be integer between 0 and 9.\n\nAt each turn, when player is at y_t, we need to ensure that for that y_t and time t, there is no collision on that freeway.\n\nSince collision depends on the freeway and time.\n\nPlayer position sequence: let y_0 = 2 at t=74 (Δt=0)\n\nThen at each step, based on action, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy from action.\n\nCollision at turn t: if player is on freeway y_t, and for freeway y_t, at time t (Δt = t-74), there is a car with 0 in span.\n\nIf y_t = 0 or y_t=9, no freeway, so no collision possible. y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, only y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\nThe vertical axis y=0,1,2,...,9, and freeways are y=1 to 8 for cars. y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nIn the problem: \"freeways y = 1, …, 8\" and \"collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\".\n\nAlso, player position (0, y_t), so x=0 is the lane we care about.\n\nAt y=0 or y=9, no cars, so no collision possible. Only when on y=1 to 8, we need to avoid collision at that time.\n\nGoal is to reach (0,9), which is safe.\n\nNow, minimal H: since from y=2 to y=9, 7 steps up would take 7 turns, but we might need to wait or detour.\n\nBut let's see the collision times.\n\nFirst, at start: t=74, Δt=0, y=2.\n\nFreeway 2: at Δt=0, is there collision? For freeway 2, collision only at Δt=4, not at 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways at Δt=0: freeway 1 collision at 14-17, not 0; freeway 2 at 4, not 0; etc. freeway 7 at 6-7, not 0. So all safe at Δt=0.\n\nPlayer at y=2, which is freeway 2? y=2 is freeway 2.\n\nFreeway k corresponds to y=k, I assume.\n\nIn the table, freeway k for y=k.\n\nSo at t=74, y=2, freeway 2, Δt=0, collision? For freeway 2, collision at Δt=4, not 0, so no collision, safe.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\nThe critical times are when collisions happen on certain freeways.\n\nFor example, at Δt=4, freeways 2,3,4,5,6 all have collision. That is, y=2,3,4,5,6 are all dangerous at Δt=4.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nAt Δt=4:\n\n- y=2: collision\n\n- y=3: collision (freeway 3)\n\n- y=4: collision\n\n- y=5: collision\n\n- y=6: collision\n\n- y=1: freeway 1 collision only at 14-17, not at 4, so safe at Δt=4\n\n- y=7: freeway 7 collision at 6-7, not at 4, so safe? Δt=4, freeway 7: collision at Δt=6,7, not 4, so no collision at Δt=4 for y=7.\n\nSimilarly, y=8: same, collision at Δt=6,7, not 4.\n\ny=1: no collision at Δt=4.\n\nSo at Δt=4, y=1,7,8 are safe, but y=2,3,4,5,6 have collision.\n\nSimilarly, at Δt=6 and 7, y=7 and y=8 have collision.\n\ny=7 and y=8 collision at Δt=6 and 7.\n\nNow, Δt=6: freeway 7 collision, so if on y=7 at that time, collision.\n\nSimilarly, Δt=7: freeway 7 and 8 collision? Freeway 7 at Δt=6 and 7, freeway 8 same.\n\nNow, also, at Δt=14-17, y=1 has collision.\n\nBut since we want minimal turns, and y=9 is far, Δt=14 might be later, so perhaps we can reach before that.\n\nMinimal possible H: if we go up every turn, from y=2 to y=9, 7 steps, so at turn t=74+6=80, y=8? Let's see:\n\nAt t=74, y=2\n\nAfter one U: t=75, y=3\n\nt=76, y=4\n\n...\n\nAfter k U moves, at turn t=74+k, y=2+k\n\nSet y=9: 2+k=9, k=7, so at turn t=74+7=81, y=9.\n\nt=74: y=2\n\nt=75: y=3 after U\n\nt=76: y=4\n\nt=77: y=5\n\nt=78: y=6\n\nt=79: y=7\n\nt=80: y=8\n\nt=81: y=9\n\nSo after 7 actions (U each), from t=74 to t=80, 7 actions? t=74 to t=81 is 7 turns later? Let's index.\n\nStart at turn t=74, position y=2.\n\nAfter first action at t=74, we move to next turn.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, player is at position y_t.\n\nThen we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1, and after H actions, at turn t1+H, position is y_{t1+H}.\n\nAnd we want y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nIn the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1\", and \"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"? Let's read.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\n\"reach (0,9)\" meaning the position after H actions is (0,9).\n\nAfter performing the actions, at turn t1 + H, the position is (0,9).\n\nThe actions are applied from turn t1 to t1+H-1, so after H actions, at turn t1+H, y = y_{t1} + sum of Δy.\n\ny_{t1 + H} = y_{t1} + sum_{k=0}^{H-1} Δy_{t1 + k}\n\nSet equal to 9.\n\ny_{t1} =2, so 2 + sum Δy =9, so sum Δy =7.\n\nEach Δy is +1, -1, or 0, so to minimize H, we need as many U as possible, but we might need S or D to avoid being on bad positions at bad times.\n\nH is the number of turns/actions.\n\nMinimal H is at least 7, if all U.\n\nBut we need to check if we can go directly with all U without collision.\n\nSo let's simulate the direct path: all U from y=2.\n\nt: turn number\n\nΔt: t - 74\n\ny_t: position at turn t\n\nCollision check: for each t, if y_t between 1 and 8, and on that freeway, at time t, collision possible.\n\nt=74, Δt=0, y=2\n\nFreeway 2, at Δt=0, no collision (as before), safe.\n\nAction a_{74}: U, so y_{75} =3\n\nt=75, Δt=1, y=3\n\nFreeway 3, at Δt=1: collision? Freeway 3 collision at Δt=4 only, not at 1, so safe.\n\nAction U, y_{76}=4\n\nt=76, Δt=2, y=4\n\nFreeway 4, collision at Δt=4, not 2, safe.\n\nAction U, y_{77}=5\n\nt=77, Δt=3, y=5\n\nFreeway 5, collision at Δt=4, not 3, safe.\n\nAction U, y_{78}=6\n\nt=78, Δt=4, y=6\n\nFreeway 6, at Δt=4, collision! Yes, freeway 6 has collision at Δt=4.\n\nSo if we are on y=6 at t=78 (Δt=4), collision occurs.\n\nCannot be there.\n\nThus, direct path has collision at t=78.\n\nNeed to avoid this.\n\nAt t=78, Δt=4, we cannot be on y=2,3,4,5,6.\n\ny=1,7,8 are safe at Δt=4.\n\nBut we are at y=6 at that time in direct path.\n\nSo we need to not be on those y at that time.\n\nOptions: either be on y=1,7,8 at t=78, or be on y=0 or 9, but y=9 not yet, or stay away.\n\nSince we are going up, we might need to slow down or move down.\n\nMinimal H might be more than 7.\n\nFirst, let's list the dangerous times.\n\nCritical points: Δt=4: avoid y=2,3,4,5,6\n\nΔt=6: freeway 7 collision, so avoid y=7\n\nΔt=7: freeway 7 and 8 collision, so avoid y=7 and y=8\n\nΔt=14-17: avoid y=1, but since we want to reach fast, Δt=14 is late, we can ignore if we reach before.\n\nSimilarly, other times might be safe.\n\nNow, we need to get from y=2 at Δt=0 to y=9 at some turn.\n\nLet me define the turn index with Δt.\n\nSet τ = Δt, starting from τ=0.\n\nPlayer at τ=0, y=2.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some τ_final.\n\nThe time τ corresponds to turn t=74+τ.\n\nAt each step, we choose action: U, D, S, changing y by +1,-1,0.\n\ny must be in [0,9].\n\nCollision at time τ if y_τ ∈ {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8} and for that y, at τ, collision occurs as per above.\n\nFrom above:\n\n- For y=1: collision at τ=14,15,16,17\n\n- y=2: collision at τ=4\n\n- y=3: collision at τ=4\n\n- y=4: collision at τ=4\n\n- y=5: collision at τ=4\n\n- y=6: collision at τ=4\n\n- y=7: collision at τ=6 and 7\n\n- y=8: collision at τ=6 and 7\n\nAt other times, no collision for that y.\n\nFor example, y=1 safe except τ=14-17, y=2 safe except τ=4, etc.\n\nNow, since we start at τ=0, y=2, and τ=4 is soon, we need to handle τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, we must not be on y=2,3,4,5,6.\n\nPossible safe positions at τ=4: y=0,1,7,8,9\n\nBut y=9 might not be reachable by τ=4 from y=2 in 4 steps? At τ=0, y=2, after 4 actions, at τ=4, y could be from 2-4 to 2+4, but y<=9.\n\nMin y: if all D, y=2-4= -2, but y=0 min, so y>=0.\n\nSimilarly max y=6 if all U, but y=9 not reachable in 4 steps from y=2 since 2+4=6<9.\n\nAt τ=4, y position: after 4 actions from τ=0.\n\nAt τ=0, before any action, y=2.\n\nAfter first action at τ=0, y_{τ+1} set.\n\nPosition at time τ: after τ steps? Let's clarify.\n\nAt the start, τ=0 (t=74), position is given as (0,2).\n\nThen we apply action a_{t1 + τ} for τ=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter action at τ, position changes to next τ.\n\nSo at time τ, position is y_τ.\n\nAfter action a_τ, y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy_τ.\n\nWe care about collision at each time τ based on y_τ.\n\nFor τ=4, we have y_4.\n\nFrom y_0=2, after 4 actions, y_4 = y_0 + sum_{k=0}^{3} Δy_k\n\nEach Δy is +1,0,-1, so y_4 between 2-4= -2 and 2+4=6, but y in [0,9], so y_4 between 0 and 6.\n\nAt τ=4, safe y are: 0,1,7,8,9 but since y_4 <=6, possible safe y at τ=4 are y=0 or y=1.\n\ny=7,8,9 not possible since max y_4=6.\n\ny=1 is safe at τ=4, since collision only at τ=14-17.\n\ny=0 is always safe.\n\nSo at τ=4, we must be on y=0 or y=1.\n\nNow, similarly, at τ=6 and τ=7, we need to avoid y=7 and y=8.\n\nBut τ=6 and 7 are later.\n\nFirst, let's get to τ=4 safely.\n\nWe start at τ=0, y=2.\n\nWe need to reach y=0 or y=1 at τ=4.\n\ny=0 or y=1 at τ=4.\n\nNow, from y=2 to y=0 or 1 in 4 steps.\n\nBut we also need to go to y=9 eventually.\n\nMoreover, during the path, we need no collision at each step.\n\nFirst, let's list the positions for τ from 0 to 4.\n\nAt τ=0, y=2, which is safe since no collision at τ=0 for y=2.\n\nNow, we need to choose actions such that at τ=1,2,3, no collision, and at τ=4, y=0 or 1.\n\ny=1 at τ=4 is safe, y=0 safe.\n\nNow, possible paths to y=0 or y=1 at τ=4.\n\nSince we want minimal H, we might not want to go down too much.\n\ny=1 at τ=4 might be better.\n\nNow, from y=2 at τ=0.\n\nAfter actions:\n\nLet me denote the sequence.\n\nSet y_τ for τ=0,1,2,3,4.\n\ny_0 = 2\n\ny_1 = y_0 + a_0, where a_0 action: U:+1, D:-1, S:0\n\nSimilarly, y_2 = y_1 + a_1\n\ny_3 = y_2 + a_2\n\ny_4 = y_3 + a_3\n\nEach y_τ must be in [0,9], and no collision at that τ.\n\nAt τ=0: y=2, safe as before.\n\nNow, at τ=1: possible y_1 = 1,2,3\n\nNow, check if safe:\n\ny=1 at τ=1: collision? Freeway 1 collision only at τ=14-17, not 1, so safe.\n\ny=2 at τ=1: freeway 2 collision only at τ=4, not 1, safe.\n\ny=3 at τ=1: freeway 3 collision only at τ=4, not 1, safe.\n\nAll possible.\n\nSimilarly, τ=2: y could be from min to max, but depends.\n\nWe need to reach y=0 or 1 at τ=4.\n\nSince y=1 is higher, better to go to y=1 if possible.\n\nBut let's see the actions.\n\nTo be at y=1 at τ=4, from y=2, we need net change of -1 in 4 steps, so sum of Δy = -1.\n\nSimilarly, to y=0, sum Δy = -2.\n\nBut we can have S or D.\n\nNow, also, at τ=4, y=1 is safe.\n\nNow, for the intermediate steps.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on dangerous y at wrong times, but at τ=1,2,3, the only dangerous time is if we are on y with collision, but for τ=1,2,3, let's see when collisions happen.\n\nFor example, at τ=1: for y=1, collision only at 14-17, not 1, safe.\n\ny=2: collision at τ=4, not 1, safe.\n\ny=3: collision at τ=4, not 1, safe.\n\ny=4: collision at τ=4, not 1, safe? τ=1, freeway 4 collision only at τ=4, not at τ=1, so if y=4 at τ=1, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all y are safe at τ=1,2,3 except possibly if there were other collisions, but from earlier, no collisions at τ=1,2,3 for any y.\n\nFor example, y=7: collision at τ=6,7, not 1,2,3.\n\nSimilarly others. So at τ=1,2,3, all positions are safe, no collision possible at those times for any freeway.\n\nOnly at τ=4,6,7,14-17 we have issues, but τ=1,2,3 are safe.\n\nSo we don't need to worry about collision at τ=1,2,3; only at τ=4 we need to be careful.\n\nSimilarly, later at τ=6,7.\n\nBut for now, from τ=0 to τ=4, we only care about being safe at τ=4, and the path is free.\n\nSo to reach y=0 or 1 at τ=4.\n\nSince we want to go up eventually, better to be at y=1 than y=0.\n\nSo let's aim for y=1 at τ=4.\n\ny_4 =1.\n\ny_0=2\n\nSo sum_{k=0}^3 Δy_k = y_4 - y_0 =1-2= -1\n\nSo net down by 1 in 4 steps.\n\nPossible with one D and three S, or one S and one D and two U? But we need to go up later, but for now.\n\nActions: we can have, for example, three S and one D, in some order.\n\nOr one D and three S, etc.\n\nBut y must stay within bounds.\n\nSince all positions between are safe, we can choose any sequence as long as y_τ in [0,9].\n\nFor example, one way: at τ=0, action S: y_1=2 +0=2\n\nτ=1, action S: y_2=2\n\nτ=2, action S: y_3=2\n\nτ=3, action D: y_4=2-1=1\n\nThen at τ=4, y=1, safe.\n\nAt τ=0, action D: y_1=1, then we can stay or whatever, but need y_4=1.\n\nBut y_4=1.\n\nIn this case, with actions: S,S,S,D at τ=0,1,2,3\n\nThen y: τ=0:2, τ=1:2, τ=2:2, τ=3:2, τ=4:1\n\nAll safe.\n\nWe could do D at τ=0: y_1=1, then S,S,S: y_2=1, y_3=1, y_4=1\n\nOr other combinations.\n\nBut since we need to go up later, it might be similar.\n\nNow, at τ=4, y=1, safe.\n\nNow, from here, we need to go to y=9.\n\ny=1 at τ=4.\n\nNow, τ=4, t=74+4=78.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9.\n\nDifference: 9-1=8, so at least 8 more U actions, but we need to avoid collisions at τ=6 and τ=7.\n\nFirst, τ=6 and τ=7 are coming.\n\nτ=6 corresponds to Δt=6, which is t=74+6=80.\n\nSimilarly τ=7, t=81.\n\nNow, at τ=6 and τ=7, we need to avoid y=7 and y=8.\n\nBecause freeway 7 and 8 have collision at those times.\n\nSpecifically, at τ=6: avoid y=7\n\nAt τ=7: avoid y=7 and y=8\n\nAlso, at other times, but τ=6 and 7 are soon.\n\nNow, from τ=4, y=1.\n\nWe need to go up.\n\nBut at τ=6, which is 2 steps later from τ=4.\n\nτ=4 to τ=6: after actions at τ=4 and τ=5.\n\nPosition at τ=6 depends on actions at τ=4 and τ=5.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSet τ_index from τ=4 onwards.\n\nAt τ=4, y=1\n\nNow, we want to reach y=9.\n\nAt τ=6, we must not be on y=7.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=7, not on y=7 or y=8.\n\nNow, possible to be on other y.\n\ny=9 is safe, but we may not reach yet.\n\nNow, let's think about the timing.\n\nFirst, from τ=4, y=1, if we go up, after k steps, y=1+k at τ=4+k.\n\nWe need to ensure that at τ=6, y≠7, and at τ=7, y≠7 and y≠8.\n\nτ=6 is at step τ=6.\n\ny at τ=6.\n\nFrom τ=4, after two actions: at τ=5 and τ=4 action? Actions at τ=4 and τ=5 affect y_5 and y_6.\n\ny_4 =1\n\nAfter a_4, y_5 = y_4 + Δy_4\n\nAfter a_5, y_6 = y_5 + Δy_5\n\nThen y_6 at τ=6.\n\nSimilarly, y_7 at τ=7.\n\nWe need y_6 ≠7\n\nAnd y_7 ≠7 and y_7 ≠8\n\nAlso, we need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nSince minimal actions to go up, but we might need to slow down to avoid being at y=7 at τ=6 or τ=7.\n\nNow, at τ=6, if y_6=7, collision.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=7, if y_7=7 or 8, collision.\n\nNow, from y=1 at τ=4, if we go up continuously, y_τ:\n\nτ=4: y=1\n\na_4=U: y_5=2\n\na_5=U: y_6=3\n\na_5=U: y_6= y_5 +1, but y_5=2, so y_6=3\n\nThen at τ=6, y=3, which is not 7, so safe.\n\nThen continue: a_6=U, y_7=4\n\nAt τ=7, y=4, not 7 or 8, safe.\n\na_7=U, y_8=5\n\nAnd so on, up to y=9.\n\nBut let's see when we reach y=9.\n\ny=1 at τ=4\n\nAfter U: τ=5, y=2\n\nU: τ=6, y=3\n\nU: τ=7, y=4\n\nU: τ=8, y=5\n\nU: τ=9, y=6\n\nU: τ=10, y=7\n\nU: τ=11, y=8\n\nU: τ=12, y=9\n\nAt τ=12, y=9, reached.\n\nNow, check collisions: at τ=6, y=3, freeway 3, at τ=6, collision? Freeway 3 collision only at τ=4, not at 6, so safe.\n\nτ=7, y=4, freeway 4, collision only at τ=4, not 7, safe.\n\nτ=10, y=7, at τ=10, freeway 7 collision at τ=6 and 7, not 10, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut we need to check if at any point we are on dangerous spot.\n\nFor example, at τ=10, y=7, τ=10, freeway 7 collision only at τ=6 and 7, so at τ=10, no collision.\n\nSimilarly, τ=11, y=8, freeway 8 collision at τ=6 and 7, not 11, safe.\n\nSo this path seems collision-free.\n\nIn this path, we reached y=9 at τ=12.\n\nBut τ=12 means t=74+12=86, and H actions from τ=0 to τ=11? Let's count the actions.\n\nTotal turns: from τ=0 to τ=12, but τ is the time index.\n\nAt τ=0 (start), after H actions, at time τ=H, position.\n\nIn this case, from τ=0 to τ=12, we have 12 steps? No.\n\nStart at τ=0, after 0 actions, position y=2.\n\nAfter first action (τ=0 action), at τ=1, position y_1.\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at τ=k, position y_k.\n\nTo have y_H =9.\n\nIn the path above: at τ=4, y=1\n\nThen after actions: at τ=5, y=2 (after U)\n\nτ=6, y=3 (U)\n\nτ=7, y=4 (U)\n\nτ=8, y=5 (U)\n\nτ=9, y=6 (U)\n\nτ=10, y=7 (U)\n\nτ=11, y=8 (U)\n\nτ=12, y=9 (U)\n\nSo y_12=9, so we need actions from τ=0 to τ=11, that is 12 actions (H=12), and y_{t1 + H} = y_{74 + 12} = y_{86} =9.\n\nBut earlier we had a delay because we stayed low until τ=4.\n\nIn the beginning, from τ=0 to τ=4, we had actions to stay at y=2 mostly and go to y=1 at τ=4.\n\nIn my earlier plan, at τ=0 to τ=3, we had S,S,S,D to have y_4=1.\n\nBut we could go up earlier if possible, but at τ=4 we need to be at y=0 or 1.\n\nIn the direct path, we had collision at τ=4 if we go up, but now we avoided by being low.\n\nBut in this new path, from τ=4 we go up continuously.\n\nBut can we start going up earlier?\n\nFor example, at τ=0, instead of staying, we could go down to y=1 immediately.\n\nBut y=1 is safe at τ=4, but we can be at y=1 earlier.\n\nBut at τ=4, we need to be at safe y, which y=1 is fine.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach faster.\n\nMinimal H: we need sum Δy = +7 to go from y=2 to y=9.\n\nEach S or D adds extra turns.\n\nIn the above path, from τ=0 to τ=12, we used 12 actions.\n\nBut how many U? From τ=0 to τ=3: in my sequence, three S and one D, so net -1, from y=2 to y=1 at τ=4.\n\nThen from τ=4 to τ=12: 8 actions, all U, from y=1 to y=9, +8, but y from 1 to 9 is +8, yes.\n\nBut we used 4 actions to go from y=2 to y=1, which is inefficient.\n\nWe could be at higher y earlier, but constrained by τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, we must be at y<=1 to be safe, since y=2-6 are unsafe.\n\ny=0 or 1 only possible.\n\nSo we have to be low at τ=4.\n\nThen from there, we go up, but we passed τ=6 and τ=7 safely at low y.\n\nIn the up path, we were at y=3 at τ=6, y=4 at τ=7, which are fine.\n\nBut we can go up faster after τ=4.\n\nAfter τ=4, no immediate constraints until τ=6, but τ=6 is soon.\n\nFrom τ=4, y=1, to reach y=9, minimal 8 U, but if all U, y at τ=6: τ=4 y=1, τ=5 y=2, τ=6 y=3, which is not 7, so safe, as before.\n\nBut we have τ=14-17, but if we reach y=9 by τ=12, which is before τ=14, so no issue.\n\nCan we reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if we can be higher at τ=4, but we cannot, because at τ=4, y must be 0 or 1, cannot be higher.\n\nUnless we are at y=7 or 8 at τ=4, but impossible since max y at τ=4 is 6.\n\nSo we must be at y=0 or 1 at τ=4.\n\nThen from there, to y=9, need +8, so at least 8 actions after τ=4.\n\nThus minimal H: from τ=0 to τ=4, 4 actions to reach y=1 (or 0), then 8 actions to y=9, so total 12 actions, reaching at τ=12.\n\nBut we can have fewer actions if we use more U, but at τ=4 we have to be low.\n\nFor example, if at τ=0, we go down to y=1 immediately: a_0=D, y_1=1\n\nThen we need to be at y=1 at τ=4, so from τ=1 to τ=3, we can stay or move, but y_4 must be 1.\n\nSince y_1=1, we can do S,S,S for τ=1,2,3 actions, so y_2=1, y_3=1, y_4=1.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nWe could go up a bit, but y_4 must be 1, so if we go up, we have to come down, which might use more actions or same.\n\nFor example, a_0=D, y_1=1\n\nThen a_1=U, y_2=2\n\nThen a_2=D, y_3=1\n\na_3=S, y_4=1\n\nBut we used extra actions: U and D, net zero, same as staying, but more actions? Actions: D,U,D,S: four actions to have y_4=1, same as before with S,S,S,D or other.\n\nNet, to have y_4=1 from y_0=2, we need sum of four Δy = -1, so we must have one more down than up, or stays.\n\nMinimal actions to achieve sum Δy = -1 over four steps, with each |Δy|<=1, so we must have at least one D and possibly S or U, but with net -1.\n\nNumber of actions is fixed at four for this segment.\n\nSimilarly, to reach y=9 from y=1, need eight U, so eight actions.\n\nTotal actions: 4 + 8 = 12, reaching at τ=12.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions from τ=0 to τ=11, for 12 actions.\n\nτ from 0 to 11 inclusive is 12 actions.\n\nIn the answer, we need the sequence from t=74 onwards.\n\nBut in the above, we have a path, but let's confirm the collision at τ=6 and τ=7.\n\nIn the path, at τ=6, y=3, which is not 7, and freeway 3 collision only at τ=4, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut earlier I thought about τ=6 and 7 for y=7 and 8, but in this path we are not there at that time.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 faster by going up immediately after τ=4.\n\nBut we need to avoid τ=6 and 7 for y=7,8.\n\nIn this case, since we start from low, we are fine.\n\nAnother idea: at τ=4, we are at y=1, but we could be at y=0, but y=1 is better.\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut at τ=10, y=7, which is late, no collision.\n\nBut is there a way to be at higher y earlier?\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=7 or 8 at τ=4, but impossible.\n\nPerhaps we don't need to stay low all the time; only at τ=4 we need to be safe.\n\nBut since τ=1,2,3 are safe, we can be at higher y at those times.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, y=2, action U: y_1=3\n\nThen at τ=1, y=3, safe.\n\nAction U: y_2=4\n\nτ=2, y=4, safe.\n\nAction U: y_3=5\n\nτ=3, y=5, safe.\n\nNow, at τ=3, y=5.\n\nNow, we need y_4 to be 0 or 1.\n\nBut y_3=5, so to have y_4=0 or 1, we need action D or multiple D, but only one action.\n\nAction a_3: if D, y_4=4, but y=4 at τ=4 is unsafe, collision.\n\nIf S, y_4=5, unsafe.\n\nIf U, y_4=6, unsafe.\n\nAll lead to unsafe y at τ=4.\n\nCannot be at y=5 at τ=3 because then y_4 cannot be 0 or 1 with one action.\n\nSimilarly, if at τ=3, y=4, then a_3=D: y_4=3, unsafe; S:4 unsafe; U:5 unsafe.\n\nIf y=3 at τ=3, then a_3=D: y_4=2 unsafe; S:3 unsafe; U:4 unsafe.\n\nIf y=2 at τ=3, a_3=D: y_4=1 safe; S:2 unsafe; U:3 unsafe.\n\nOnly if we do D, to y=1.\n\nIf y=1 at τ=3, then a_3=S: y_4=1 safe; D: y_4=0 safe; U: y_4=2 unsafe.\n\nSo possible.\n\nBut to have y=1 at τ=3, from start.\n\ny_0=2.\n\nIf we want y_3=1, then sum of three Δy = -1.\n\nFor example, a_0=S, a_1=S, a_2=D: y_1=2, y_2=2, y_3=1? a_2=D, y_3=y_2 + (-1), y_2=2, so y_3=1.\n\nThen at τ=3, y=1.\n\nThen a_3: to have y_4=1, we can do S, or if we do D, y_4=0, also safe.\n\nBut y=1 is fine.\n\nThen from there, same as before.\n\ny_3=1, a_3=S, y_4=1.\n\nThen continue up.\n\nBut we saved one action? From τ=0 to τ=3, with three actions, y from 2 to 1.\n\nThen at τ=4, y=1.\n\nThen from τ=4, go up to y=9 in 8 actions, so total actions: 3 (to τ=3) + 1 (at τ=3) + 8 = 12 actions? Let's see.\n\nActions from τ=0 to τ=11.\n\nAt τ=0: action, to y_1\n\n...\n\nAfter action at τ=11, y_12.\n\nIn this: at τ=0: say S, y_1=2\n\nτ=1: S, y_2=2\n\nτ=2: D, y_3=1\n\nτ=3: S, y_4=1\n\nThen τ=4: U, y_5=2\n\nτ=5: U, y_6=3\n\nτ=6: U, y_7=4\n\n...\n\nUp to τ=11: U, y_12=9\n\ny_4=1, y_5=2, y_6=3, y_7=4, y_8=5, y_9=6, y_10=7, y_11=8, y_12=9\n\nSame as before, 12 actions.\n\nIf at τ=3, y=1, and we do a_3=D, y_4=0, then from y=0, we need to go up more, but y=0 to y=9 is 9 steps, worse.\n\nSo better to stay at y=1.\n\nThus minimal H is 12.\n\nBut in the sequence, we can start going up after τ=4.\n\nNow, about τ=6 and τ=7: in this path, at τ=6, y=3, safe; τ=7, y=4, safe.\n\nNo issue.\n\nWe could have been at higher y later, but no problem.\n\nNow, but we have freeway 1 collision at τ=14-17, but since we reach y=9 at τ=12 <14, we are fine.\n\nNow, in the beginning, we need to specify the actions.\n\nSince at τ=0 to τ=3, we need to have net down by 1 to reach y=1 at τ=4, but in the sequence above, we had S at τ=0, S at τ=1, D at τ=2, S at τ=3 to have y_4=1.\n\nWe could have other sequences.\n\nFor example, D at τ=0: y_1=1, then S at τ=1, S at τ=2, S at τ=3: y_2=1, y_3=1, y_4=1.\n\nThen same.\n\nOr U at some point, but if we go up, we have to come down, which might not save actions.\n\nFor instance, a_0=U, y_1=3, then we need to come down to y=1 at τ=4, so a_1=D, y_2=2, a_2=D, y_3=1, a_3=S, y_4=1, but we used U and two D, net -1, same, but more changes.\n\nBut it works, but not better.\n\nSo simplest is to stay or move directly to y=1.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need the action sequence starting from t=74.\n\nt=74 corresponds to τ=0.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=74 to t=74 + H -1.\n\nH=12, so actions from t=74 to t=85.\n\nThen at t=86, position y=9.\n\nNow, sequence: one possible sequence:\n\nAt t=74 (τ=0): S (stay, y=2)\n\nt=75 (τ=1): S (stay, y=2)\n\nt=76 (τ=2): D (down, to y=1? After D, at next turn.\n\nAt t=76, action D, so y at t=77: y=2-1=1? Positions:\n\nt=74: y=2\n\na_{74}: let's say S, then y_{75} =2\n\na_{75}: S, y_{76} =2\n\na_{76}: D, y_{77} =2 -1 =1\n\na_{77}: S, y_{78} =1? We need y at τ=4, which is t=78.\n\nt=74: τ=0\n\nt=75: τ=1\n\nt=76: τ=2\n\nt=77: τ=3\n\nt=78: τ=4\n\ny at t=78: which is after action at t=77.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nAfter a_{76}: at t=77, y=1 (since a_{76}=D, from y_{76}=2 to y_{77}=1)\n\ny_{77} is position at turn t=77, which is after action at t=76.\n\nThen a_{77}: say S, then y_{78} = y_{77} +0 =1\n\nSo at t=78 (τ=4), y=1, safe.\n\nThen a_{78}: U, y_{79} =1+1=2\n\nt=79: y=2\n\na_{79}: U, y_{80} =3\n\nt=80: y=3\n\na_{80}: U, y_{81} =4\n\nt=81: y=4\n\na_{81}: U, y_{82} =5\n\nt=82: y=5\n\na_{82}: U, y_{83} =6\n\nt=83: y=6\n\na_{83}: U, y_{84} =7\n\nt=84: y=7\n\na_{84}: U, y_{85} =8\n\nt=85: y=8\n\na_{85}: U, y_{86} =9\n\nReached at t=86.\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nt=78 (τ=4): y=1, freeway 1, at τ=4, no collision (collision only 14-17), safe.\n\nt=79: y=2, freeway 2, τ=5? t=79, Δt= t-74=5, freeway 2 collision at Δt=4, not 5, safe.\n\nt=80: y=3, freeway 3, Δt=6, collision only at Δt=4, not 6, safe.\n\nt=81: y=4, freeway 4, Δt=7, collision at Δt=4 only, not 7, safe.\n\nt=82: y=5, freeway 5, Δt=8, safe.\n\nt=83: y=6, freeway 6, Δt=9, collision only at Δt=4, not 9, safe.\n\nt=84: y=7, freeway 7, Δt=10, collision at Δt=6 and 7, not 10, safe.\n\nt=85: y=8, freeway 8, Δt=11, collision at Δt=6 and 7, not 11, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nH=12.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nSuppose we go to y=0 at τ=4, but that would require more downs, then from y=0 to y=9, 9 U, so total more actions.\n\nFor example, to y=0 at τ=4: from y=2, need sum Δy = -2 in 4 steps, e.g., two D and two S.\n\nThen from y=0, need 9 U to y=9, total actions: 4 + 9 =13, worse.\n\nSo y=1 at τ=4 is better.\n\nCan we reach y=9 before τ=12?\n\nFor example, if we can be at higher y at τ=4, but impossible.\n\nAfter τ=4, go all U, but from y=1, to y=9, 8 steps, at τ=12.\n\nIf we go faster, but we can only move one step per turn.\n\nUnless we are at higher y earlier, but at τ=4 we are low.\n\nAnother idea: at τ=6 and τ=7, instead of avoiding y=7 and 8, we could be on other y, but in the direct path we had issue at τ=4.\n\nBut since we handled τ=4 by being low, and τ=6,7 are fine as long as not on 7 or 8.\n\nBut in the path, we are not.\n\nPerhaps we can delay or something, but minimal is 12.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can have H=11.\n\nSuppose H=11, then y_{74+11} = y_{85} =9.\n\ny_{85} =9.\n\nNow, y_{74} =2, so sum of 11 Δy =7.\n\nThus, number of U minus number of D =7, and number of S = 11 - (U + D).\n\nLet U be number of up, D down, S stay, U + D + S =11, and U - D =7.\n\nThen U = D +7, so 2D + S +7 =11, so 2D + S =4.\n\nPossible: D=0, S=4, U=7? U= D+7, if D=0, U=7, then S=11-7-0=4, but U + D + S=7+0+4=11, U-D=7, yes.\n\nThen net up 7, from y=2 to y=9.\n\nBut we need to avoid collision.\n\nNow, at τ=4 (t=78), we must not be on y=2,3,4,5,6.\n\nIn this case, with U=7, D=0, S=4, we have four stays.\n\ny at τ=4: depends on the actions.\n\nSince we have stays, we can be at different y.\n\nFor example, if we stay at some points.\n\nBut at τ=4, y must be 0 or 1.\n\nBut with net up and no down, from y=2, at τ=4, y_4 >=2, since no down, and we might have stays, but if we go up, y increases, if stay, same, so y_4 >=2, cannot be 0 or 1.\n\nContradiction.\n\nIf we have down actions, but in this case D=0, no down, so y_4 >=2, but at τ=4, y=2,3,4,5,6 all unsafe, so collision inevitable.\n\nIf we have D>0, then from 2D + S =4, with U=D+7.\n\nFor example, D=1, then U=8, S=11-8-1=2? U+D+S=8+1+2=11, U-D=7, yes.\n\nThen y_4: start y=2, after 4 actions, sum Δy for first 4 actions.\n\nBut U-D for the whole, but for first 4, it could be different.\n\ny_4 = 2 + sum_{k=0}^3 Δy_k\n\nEach Δy = +1,0,-1.\n\nWe need y_4 <=1, since must be safe, so 2 + sum_{0}^3 Δy <=1, so sum <= -1.\n\nBut with the actions, we have to have some down.\n\nBut in the sequence, we might have downs early.\n\nFor example, suppose we have downs in the first few actions.\n\nBut at τ=4, we need y_4 <=1.\n\nThen from there to τ=11, we need to reach y=9.\n\ny at τ=11.\n\ny_4 <=1, y_11=9, so need to increase by at least 8 in 7 actions (from τ=4 to τ=10 actions?).\n\nActions from τ=4 to τ=10, 7 actions, to go from y_4 to y_11.\n\ny_11 = y_4 + sum_{k=4}^{10} Δy_k\n\nSet y_11=9, y_4 <=1, so sum_{k=4}^{10} Δy >=8\n\nBut in 7 actions, maximum increase is 7 (all U), so if y_4 <=1, with all U, y_11 <= y_4 +7 <=1+7=8 <9, cannot reach y=9.\n\nIf y_4=1, y_11 <=8, not 9.\n\nIf y_4=0, y_11<=7<9.\n\nThus impossible to reach y=9 at τ=11 if y_4 <=1.\n\nTherefore, for H=11, y_{85}=9, which requires y_4 <=1 but then cannot reach in 7 steps.\n\nThus H=11 impossible.\n\nSimilarly, H=12 is possible as before.\n\nThus minimal H is 12.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we can have various, but let's write one.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt t=74: S  (y=2 after, but action at t=74, after action y at t=75=2)\n\nIn the sequence, we list the actions.\n\nAnswer format:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t1}\n\nTurn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t1 + H -1\n\nFor H=12, actions from t=74 to t=85.\n\nt1=74, H=12, so actions for turn 74 to 85, that's 12 actions.\n\nThen at t=86, y=9.\n\nNow, sequence:\n\nOne simple: as before, stay at y=2 for first two turns, then down to y=1, then stay, then up all.\n\nBut to save actions, but we have to.\n\nWe can go down immediately.\n\nSet:\n\nTurn 74: D  (down, to y=1 at t=75)\n\nThen to stay at y=1 until t=78.\n\nt=75: y=1\n\na_{75}: S, y_{76}=1\n\na_{76}: S, y_{77}=1\n\na_{77}: S, y_{78}=1  (now t=78, τ=4, y=1 safe)\n\nThen\n\na_{78}: U, y_{79}=2\n\na_{79}: U, y_{80}=3\n\na_{80}: U, y_{81}=4\n\na_{81}: U, y_{82}=5\n\na_{82}: U, y_{83}=6\n\na_{83}: U, y_{84}=7\n\na_{84}: U, y_{85}=8\n\na_{85}: U, y_{86}=9\n\nIn this, at t=84, y=7, Δt=10, freeway 7, collision at Δt=6,7, not 10, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the sequence, actions:\n\nTurn 74: D\n\nTurn 75: S\n\nTurn 76: S\n\nTurn 77: S  (to keep y=1 at t=78)\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nTurn 79: U\n\nTurn 80: U\n\nTurn 81: U\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nTurn 83: U\n\nTurn 84: U\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nThat's from turn 74 to 85, 12 actions.\n\nAfter last action at turn 85, y at turn 86 is 9.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 77: S, y at t=78 is 1.\n\nYes.\n\nTo make it shorter, but cannot.\n\nNow, write in the box.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 6 has two cars, but we handled.\n\nAlso, at τ=4, we avoided y=2-6.\n\nIn this sequence, at t=78, y=1, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo minimal H=12.\n\nNow, the sequence.\n\nBut in the answer, we need to list the actions for each turn.\n\nAlso, the player position at start is (0,2), and we reach (0,9).\n\nNow, I think this is fine.\n</think>\nTo reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 74\\) with the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), the actions must avoid collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) based on the given car states and update rules. The car states at turn 74 are:\n\n- Freeway 1: \\((-42, -53, \\text{right}, 3)\\)\n- Freeway 2: \\((-48, -59, \\text{right}, 12)\\)\n- Freeway 3: \\((-48, -59, \\text{right}, 12)\\)\n- Freeway 4: \\((-48, -59, \\text{right}, 12)\\)\n- Freeway 5: \\((-48, -59, \\text{right}, 12)\\)\n- Freeway 6: \\((-48, -59, \\text{right}, 12)\\), \\((24, 13, \\text{right}, 12)\\)\n- Freeway 7: \\((-36, -47, \\text{right}, 6)\\), \\((12, 1, \\text{right}, 6)\\)\n- Freeway 8: \\((-36, -47, \\text{right}, 6)\\), \\((12, 1, \\text{right}, 6)\\)\n\nCollision occurs at turn \\(T\\) if the player is on a freeway \\(y_T\\) and, for any car on that freeway, \\(0\\) is within the car's span at \\(T\\). The span for right-moving cars at time \\(T\\) is \\([\\tau + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]\\), where \\(t_1 = 74\\).\n\nAnalysis shows that collisions occur at the following times relative to \\(t_1\\) (i.e., \\(\\Delta t = T - t_1\\)):\n- Freeway 1: \\(\\Delta t = 14, 15, 16, 17\\)\n- Freeway 2: \\(\\Delta t = 4\\)\n- Freeway 3: \\(\\Delta t = 4\\)\n- Freeway 4: \\(\\Delta t = 4\\)\n- Freeway 5: \\(\\Delta t = 4\\)\n- Freeway 6: \\(\\Delta t = 4\\) (from the first car; the second car never causes a collision)\n- Freeway 7: \\(\\Delta t = 6, 7\\) (from the first car; the second car never causes a collision)\n- Freeway 8: \\(\\Delta t = 6, 7\\) (from the first car; the second car never causes a collision)\n\nTo minimize \\(H\\), the player must reach \\(y = 9\\) as quickly as possible while avoiding collisions. The minimal \\(H\\) is 12, achieved by the following sequence:\n- At \\(\\Delta t = 4\\) (\\(T = 78\\)), the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) or \\(y = 1\\) to avoid collision, as all other y-values (2 to 6) are unsafe. Being at \\(y = 1\\) is preferable to minimize the number of upward moves needed later.\n- After \\(\\Delta t = 4\\), the player moves upward continuously to reach \\(y = 9\\) by \\(\\Delta t = 12\\) (\\(T = 86\\)).\n- At \\(\\Delta t = 6\\) (\\(T = 80\\)) and \\(\\Delta t = 7\\) (\\(T = 81\\)), the player is at \\(y = 3\\) and \\(y = 4\\), respectively, avoiding collisions on freeways 7 and 8.\n- The sequence reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 86, before the collision times for freeway 1 (\\(\\Delta t = 14-17\\)).\n\nThe action sequence for turns 74 to 85 (\\(H = 12\\) actions) is:\n- Turn 74: \\(D\\) (down to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 75)\n- Turn 75: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 1\\))\n- Turn 76: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 1\\))\n- Turn 77: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 1\\) at turn 78, \\(\\Delta t = 4\\), safe)\n- Turn 78: \\(U\\) (up to \\(y = 2\\))\n- Turn 79: \\(U\\) (up to \\(y = 3\\))\n- Turn 80: \\(U\\) (up to \\(y = 4\\), \\(\\Delta t = 6\\), safe as \\(y \\neq 7\\))\n- Turn 81: \\(U\\) (up to \\(y = 5\\), \\(\\Delta t = 7\\), safe as \\(y \\neq 7\\) and \\(y \\neq 8\\))\n- Turn 82: \\(U\\) (up to \\(y = 6\\))\n- Turn 83: \\(U\\) (up to \\(y = 7\\))\n- Turn 84: \\(U\\) (up to \\(y = 8\\))\n- Turn 85: \\(U\\) (up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 86)\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions and reaches \\((0, 9)\\) in 12 turns.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 74: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 75: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 76: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 77: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 78: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 79: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 80: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 81: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 82: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 83: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 84: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 85: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

Collision happens if at turn T, I'm on freeway y_T and there's a car on that freeway where 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movements. All cars are moving right, according to the table. For right-moving cars, the span at time T is [τ + s*(T - t_1), h + s*(T - t_1)], where t_1 is the current turn, which is 76.\n\nLet me denote Δt = T - t_1, so at time T = t_1 + Δt, the span for a car is:\n\nFor right-moving: [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt]\n\nSince head and tail, for right-moving, if at t_1 it's [τ, h] with τ < h, I assume, because it's from tail to head? Let me check the notation.\n\nIn the car update: for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h] and Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)]\n\nAnd since it's moving right, τ is the left end, h is the right end, so τ < h.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all are right-moving.\n\nIn the table, for example, freeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 3). -36 and -47? -36 is greater than -47, so if [τ, h] = [-47, -36]? Let's see the notation.\n\nIt says: Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor freeway 1: head h = -36, tail τ = -47, direction right, speed 3.\n\nSince it's right-moving, at t_1, the span is [τ, h] = [-47, -36], I think, because tail to head.\n\nBut numerically, -47 is less than -36, so [τ, h] = [-47, -36] means the car is from x=-47 to x=-36.\n\nThen at time T, Span(T) = [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt] = [-47 + 3*Δt, -36 + 3*Δt]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, I am on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car where 0 is in [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt] for some car on that row.\n\n0 is in the span means τ + s*Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s*Δt for that car.\n\nSince the player is at x=0 always, I think.\n\nPlayer position is (0, y_t), so x=0 fixed, only y changes.\n\nSo collision when y_t = k, and for freeway k, 0 is in some car's span at time t.\n\nNow, I start at y=3 at t=76.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nActions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), S (stay, y same).\n\ny from 0 to 9, so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nNow, I need min H, so probably go up as fast as possible, but avoid cars.\n\nFirst, let's list all freeways and their cars.\n\nFreeways y=1 to 8.\n\ny=1: one car: h=-36, τ=-47, d=right, s=3\n\nSo span at t: [ -47 + 3*Δt, -36 + 3*Δt ]\n\ny=2: one car: h=-24, τ=-35, d=right, s=12? Wait, head and tail.\n\nIt says: (-24, -35, right, 12)\n\nI think head h=-24, tail τ=-35, so since right, span at t_1: [τ, h] = [-35, -24]? No.\n\nNotation: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, ...)\"\n\nAnd for right-moving, span is [τ, h] with τ and h, but which is left/right?\n\nIn the update, for right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt]\n\nSince it moves right, τ should be the left end, so at t_1, left end is τ, right end is h, so if τ < h, it's [τ, h].\n\nBut here for y=2: head h=-24, tail τ=-35. -35 < -24, so τ = -35, h = -24, so span at t_1: [-35, -24]\n\nSimilarly, all others.\n\ny=2: car: τ=-35, h=-24, s=12, right\n\nSpan at T: [-35 + 12*Δt, -24 + 12*Δt]\n\ny=3: similarly, (-24, -35, right, 12) same as y=2? Head -24, tail -35, so same as y=2.\n\ny=3: (-24, -35, right, 12) so τ=-35, h=-24, s=12\n\ny=4: same (-24, -35, right, 12)\n\ny=5: same (-24, -35, right, 12)\n\ny=6: two cars: first (-24, -35, right, 12) and second (48, 37, right, 12)? Head 48, tail 37? 37 to 48? But 37<48, so τ=37, h=48? But direction right.\n\nList:\n\nFirst car: head h=-24, tail τ=-35, so τ=-35, h=-24\n\nSecond car: head h=48, tail τ=37, so τ=37, h=48\n\ns=12 for both.\n\ny=7: two cars: first (-24, -35, right, 6) and second (24, 13, right, 6)\n\nSo first car: τ=-35, h=-24, s=6\n\nSecond car: head h=24, tail τ=13? τ=13, h=24, s=6\n\ny=8: same as y=7: (-24, -35, right, 6), (24, 13, right, 6)\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when a car occupies x=0, i.e., when 0 is in the span for that car.\n\nSince multiple cars, I need for each freeway, the times when it is occupied at x=0.\n\nBut occupied means that for some car on that row, τ + s*Δt ≤ 0 ≤ h + s*Δt.\n\nThen collision if I am on that row at that time.\n\nNow, Δt = T - t_1 = T - 76.\n\nSet t_0 = 76, so Δt = T - 76.\n\nFor freeway k, find for which Δt, there is a car with low + s*Δt ≤ 0 ≤ high + s*Δt, where low and high are the ends.\n\nSince span [L, R] with L = τ + s*Δt, R = h + s*Δt.\n\n0 in [L,R] iff L ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ R, i.e., τ + s*Δt ≤ 0 and h + s*Δt ≥ 0? No.\n\n0 in [L,R] means L ≤ 0 ≤ R.\n\nSince L ≤ R always.\n\nSo for each car, the times when τ + s*Δt ≤ 0 and h + s*Δt ≥ 0.\n\nLet's compute for each freeway.\n\nStart with y=1:\n\nCar: τ=-47, h=-36, s=3\n\nSo L = -47 + 3*Δt\n\nR = -36 + 3*Δt\n\n0 in [L,R] when L ≤ 0 and R ≥ 0\n\nL ≤ 0: -47 + 3Δt ≤ 0 => 3Δt ≤ 47 => Δt ≤ 47/3 ≈ 15.666, so Δt ≤ 15 since integer? Time is discrete, turns, so Δt integer.\n\nT and t_1 are integers, I assume, since turns.\n\nIn the game, turns are discrete, so Δt = 0,1,2,... integer.\n\nSo L ≤ 0: -47 + 3Δt ≤ 0 => 3Δt ≤ 47 => Δt ≤ 47/3 = 15 + 2/3, so since Δt integer, Δt ≤ 15\n\nR ≥ 0: -36 + 3Δt ≥ 0 => 3Δt ≥ 36 => Δt ≥ 12\n\nSo for Δt from 12 to 15 inclusive, 0 is occupied on y=1.\n\nΔt=12: L= -47 + 36 = -11 ≤0, R= -36+36=0 ≥0, so yes, 0 in [-11,0]? R=0, so 0 is included.\n\nSimilarly, Δt=13: L= -47+39= -8, R= -36+39=3, so [ -8,3] contains 0.\n\nΔt=14: L= -47+42= -5, R= -36+42=6, contains 0.\n\nΔt=15: L= -47+45= -2, R= -36+45=9, contains 0.\n\nΔt=16: L= -47+48=1 >0, R= -36+48=12>0, but L=1>0, so 0 not in [1,12], no.\n\nSo y=1 occupied at Δt=12,13,14,15.\n\nNow y=2:\n\nCar: τ=-35, h=-24, s=12\n\nL = -35 + 12Δt\n\nR = -24 + 12Δt\n\nL ≤ 0: -35 +12Δt ≤0 => 12Δt ≤35 => Δt ≤ 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so Δt ≤ 2\n\nR ≥0: -24 +12Δt ≥0 => 12Δt ≥24 => Δt ≥2\n\nSo Δt ≥2 and Δt ≤2, so only Δt=2\n\nΔt=2: L= -35+24= -11 ≤0, R= -24+24=0 ≥0, so yes.\n\nΔt=1: L= -35+12= -23 ≤0, R= -24+12= -12 <0, so R<0, 0 not in [-23,-12]\n\nΔt=3: L= -35+36=1>0, R= -24+36=12>0, L>0, no.\n\nSo only at Δt=2, y=2 occupied.\n\nSimilarly, y=3: same as y=2, one car τ=-35,h=-24,s=12\n\nSo also only at Δt=2 occupied.\n\ny=4: same, only Δt=2.\n\ny=5: same, only Δt=2.\n\nNow y=6: two cars.\n\nFirst car: same as above, τ=-35,h=-24,s=12, so occupied at Δt=2.\n\nSecond car: head h=48, tail τ=37, s=12\n\nτ=37, h=48, s=12\n\nL = τ + s Δt = 37 + 12 Δt\n\nR = h + s Δt = 48 + 12 Δt\n\nNow L = 37 + 12Δt >0 always since Δt≥0, and R>L>0, so L and R both positive, so 0 is never in [L,R] because L>0 for all Δt.\n\nSo this car never occupies x=0. Only the first car matters for y=6.\n\nThus y=6 occupied only at Δt=2.\n\nNow y=7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: τ=-35, h=-24, s=6\n\nL = -35 + 6 Δt\n\nR = -24 + 6 Δt\n\nL ≤0: -35 +6Δt ≤0 => 6Δt ≤35 => Δt ≤ 35/6 ≈ 5.833, so Δt ≤5\n\nR ≥0: -24 +6Δt ≥0 => 6Δt ≥24 => Δt ≥4\n\nSo for Δt from 4 to 5 inclusive.\n\nΔt=4: L= -35+24= -11 ≤0, R= -24+24=0 ≥0, yes\n\nΔt=5: L= -35+30= -5 ≤0, R= -24+30=6 ≥0, yes\n\nΔt=6: L= -35+36=1>0, R= -24+36=12>0, no\n\nSecond car: τ=13, h=24, s=6\n\nL = 13 + 6 Δt\n\nR = 24 + 6 Δt\n\nL =13 +6Δt >0 always, R>L>0, so never ≤0, so 0 never in span.\n\nThus only first car matters, occupied at Δt=4 and 5.\n\nSimilarly for y=8: same as y=7, occupied at Δt=4 and 5.\n\nNow, what about y=9? But y=9 is the goal, and there are no cars on y=9, since freeways y=1 to 8, y=9 is safe, I think. The goal is to reach (0,9), and no cars there, so once I'm on y=9, I'm done.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 has no cars mentioned, but I start from y=3, going to y=9.\n\nNow, summary of occupied times (Δt relative to t_0=76):\n\n- y=1: occupied at Δt=12,13,14,15\n\n- y=2: occupied at Δt=2\n\n- y=3: occupied at Δt=2\n\n- y=4: occupied at Δt=2\n\n- y=5: occupied at Δt=2\n\n- y=6: occupied at Δt=2\n\n- y=7: occupied at Δt=4,5\n\n- y=8: occupied at Δt=4,5\n\nI need to go from y=3 at Δt=0 to y=9.\n\nAt each turn, I choose action U, D, or S, changing y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\ny must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nI need min H, so I want to go up as much as possible.\n\nBut I have to avoid being on a freeway when it's occupied at that time.\n\nAlso, note that when I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I might move to y_{T+1} at the next turn.\n\nThe collision is only if at turn T, I am on y_T and y_T is occupied at that turn.\n\nIf I move, at turn T I am on y_T, then I decide action to go to y_{T+1}, but at turn T, I am still on y_T.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nBut since I'm not on y_{T+1} at turn T, I only care about the row I'm currently on at time T.\n\nFor each turn, I need that if I'm on row k at time T, then k is not occupied at time T.\n\nNow, at start: Δt=0, t=76, y=3.\n\nIs y=3 occupied at Δt=0? Δt=0, for y=3: we have occupation only at Δt=2, so at Δt=0, not occupied. Similarly, others.\n\ny=3 at t=76: Δt=0, not occupied, since only at Δt=2.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 at Δt=0: not occupied, etc.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nThe minimal number of moves: from y=3 to y=9, difference of 6, so if I go up every turn, I can reach in 6 turns: at turn t=76, y=3; after one U, t=77, y=4; ... after 6 U, at t=82, y=9.\n\nt=76: y=3\n\nAction at t=76: U, then t=77, y=4\n\nU at t=77, t=78, y=5\n\nU at t=78, t=79, y=6\n\nU at t=79, t=80, y=7\n\nU at t=80, t=81, y=8\n\nU at t=81, t=82, y=9\n\nNow, check for collision at each turn.\n\nFirst, at t=76, Δt=0, y=3: occupied? y=3 occupied only at Δt=2, which is t=78? t=76 + Δt, Δt=0 is t=76, Δt=2 is t=78.\n\nAt t=76, Δt=0, y=3 not occupied, ok.\n\nt=77, y=4: Δt=1 (since T=77, t_1=76, Δt=1)\n\nNow, y=4 occupied at Δt=2, not at Δt=1, so ok.\n\nt=78, y=5: Δt=2\n\ny=5 occupied at Δt=2? Yes, from above, y=5 occupied at Δt=2.\n\ny=5 has car, occupied at Δt=2.\n\nAt t=78, Δt=2, y=5, and it is occupied, so collision!\n\nOh, so if I go straight up, at t=78, I am on y=5 when it is occupied.\n\nNot good.\n\nSimilarly, y=2,3,4,5,6 all occupied at Δt=2, which is t=78.\n\nt=78 is Δt=2.\n\nNow, what about t=79, y=6: Δt=3\n\ny=6 occupied only at Δt=2, not at Δt=3, so should be ok.\n\nBut in the sequence above, at t=78 y=5 is bad.\n\nt=80, y=7: Δt=4\n\ny=7 occupied at Δt=4 and 5, so yes, occupied.\n\nt=81, y=8: Δt=5, occupied.\n\nSo multiple problems.\n\nNeed to avoid being on y=2 to y=6 at Δt=2, and y=7,8 at Δt=4,5.\n\nSpecifically, at Δt=2, y=2,3,4,5,6 are all occupied.\n\ny=1 is occupied later.\n\ny=7 and 8 at Δt=4,5.\n\nNow, since I start at y=3 at Δt=0.\n\nI need to be not on rows 2-6 at Δt=2.\n\nSimilarly, not on 7 or 8 at Δt=4 or 5.\n\nBut I have to go through them at some point.\n\nMin H might be more than 6.\n\nSince I can stay or go down, but going down might not help.\n\nAnother idea: delay or avoid the occupied times.\n\nFor example, at Δt=2, all rows from 2 to 6 are occupied, so I must not be on any of them at t=78.\n\nSimilarly, at t=80 and t=81, y=7 and 8 are occupied.\n\nt=80 is Δt=4, t=81 is Δt=5.\n\nNow, possible actions.\n\nI start at t=76, y=3, Δt=0.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince I can move one step per turn, the earliest I can be at y=9 is at t=82, as above, but that has collisions.\n\nNext is t=83, etc.\n\nBut with detours.\n\nSince rows 2-6 are all bad at Δt=2, I must be either below 2 or above 6 at that time.\n\nBelow 2: y=0 or 1.\n\nAbove 6: y=7,8,9 but y=9 is goal, y=7 and 8 are bad at other times.\n\ny=7 and 8 are occupied at Δt=4 and 5.\n\nΔt=4 is t=80, Δt=5 is t=81.\n\nNow, Δt=2 is t=78.\n\nSo at t=78, I need to be not on y=2 to 6.\n\nSo y<=1 or y>=7.\n\ny=0 or 1 or 7 or 8 or 9.\n\nBut y=9 is far, since from y=3, in two turns, I can reach at most y=5 or min y=1.\n\nAt t=76, y=3.\n\nAfter one turn, t=77, y could be 2,3,4.\n\nAfter two turns, t=78, y could be 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- If at t=77 y=2, then t=78 y=1,2,3\n\n- If at t=77 y=3, then t=78 y=2,3,4\n\n- If at t=77 y=4, then t=78 y=3,4,5\n\nBut we need at t=78, y not in 2-6, so from above, only possible if y=1 at t=78.\n\nBecause y=1 is not in 2-6, and y=0,1 are safe? y=1 is occupied at other times, but at Δt=2, is y=1 occupied?\n\ny=1 occupied at Δt=12,13,14,15, not at Δt=2.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 has no cars, always safe.\n\nSo at t=78, I can be on y=1 or y=0.\n\nBut from above, the only way to have y<=1 at t=78 is if I go down.\n\nFor example, at t=76, I go down to y=2 at t=77.\n\nThen at t=77, I go down to y=1 at t=78.\n\nThen at t=78, I am on y=1, which is safe at that time.\n\nIf I go down twice: t=76: D, y=2 at t=77; t=77: D, y=1 at t=78.\n\nThen at t=78, y=1, Δt=2, not occupied, ok.\n\nBut I need to go to y=9 eventually.\n\nNow, from y=1 at t=78, I can go up.\n\nBut y=1 will be occupied later at Δt=12-15, but that is far, t=88 to 91, I should be long gone by then.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\nBut I also need to avoid y=7 and 8 at t=80 and t=81.\n\nt=80 is Δt=4, t=81 is Δt=5.\n\nNow, let's list the times.\n\nSet T relative to t_1=76, so time u = t - 76, so u=0,1,2,...\n\nAt u=0, y=3.\n\nI need to have for each u, the y position, and ensure that if y_u = k, then k not occupied at time u.\n\nOccupied times:\n\n- For k=2,3,4,5,6: occupied only at u=2\n\n- For k=1: occupied at u=12,13,14,15\n\n- For k=7: occupied at u=4,5\n\n- For k=8: occupied at u=4,5\n\n- k=0 and k=9: never occupied\n\nI need to go from y=3 at u=0 to y=9 at some u=H-1, min H.\n\nSince I move one per turn, the y position changes by at most 1 per turn.\n\nAt u=2, I must not be on y=2,3,4,5,6, so must be on y=0,1,7,8,9.\n\nBut y=7,8,9: at u=2, from y=3 at u=0, in two steps I can be at most y=5, so y=7,8,9 impossible at u=2.\n\nSimilarly, y=0: possible only if I go down twice: to y=2 at u=1, then y=1 or 0 at u=2? u=1 is after one step.\n\nu=0: y=3\n\nAfter one action at u=0, to u=1, y= y_1\n\nAfter action at u=1, to u=2, y=y_2\n\ny_2 can be: if from y=3, actions: if U to 4, then from 4, U to5, D to3, S to4; if D to2, then from2 U to3, D to1, S to2; if S to3, then from3 U to4, D to2, S to3.\n\nSo possible y_2: 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nSpecifically, min y_2=1 (D then D), max y_2=5 (U then U).\n\nSo at u=2, y can be 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nNow, y=2,3,4,5 are all occupied at u=2, so the only safe is y=1.\n\nThus at u=2, I must be on y=1.\n\nTo be on y=1 at u=2, I need to go down twice: at u=0, D to y=2 at u=1; then at u=1, D to y=1 at u=2.\n\nI could go S then D, but at u=0, S to y=3 at u=1, then D to y=2 at u=2, but y=2 is occupied at u=2.\n\nNot good.\n\nOr U then something, but U to y=4 at u=1, then to y=3,4,5 at u=2, all occupied except possibly, but y=3,4,5 occupied, no safe.\n\nOnly way: down to y=2 at u=1, then down to y=1 at u=2.\n\nSo actions: at turn t_1=76, action D, so y_{77} = y_{t_1 +1} = 3-1=2? Turn: at turn t, we perform action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nRecall the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with action at t.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at position (0, y_t), then choose action a_t, then y_{t+1} is set accordingly.\n\nThen at turn t+1, we are at (0, y_{t+1}), and so on.\n\nCollision at turn T if at that turn, on row y_T, and occupied.\n\nFor turn T, y_T is the position.\n\nIn this case, at turn t=76, y=3.\n\nWe choose a_{76}, which determines y_{77}.\n\nThen at turn t=77, we are at y_{77}, choose a_{77}, and so on.\n\nFor time, at turn T, Δt = T - t_1 = T - 76.\n\nu = T - 76.\n\nAt u=0, turn 76, y=3.\n\nAfter action, at u=1, turn 77, y=y_{77}\n\nAt u=2, turn 78, y=y_{78}, and so on.\n\nTo have y_{78} =1, as we must, since only safe at u=2.\n\nThen y_{77} must be 2, because from y=2, I can go down to y=1.\n\ny_{77} could be 1, but if y_{77}=1, then to get y_{78}=1, I need to stay or down, but down to y=0, which is also safe, but y=1 is safe at u=2, so possible to go to y=0 or y=1.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nTo have y_{78} =1, it must come from y_{77}=1 or 2 or 0? From y_{77}=1, I can go S to y=1, or D to y=0, or U to y=2.\n\nBut y_{77} at u=1.\n\nu=1, turn 77.\n\nWhat about occupation at u=1?\n\ny=1 at u=1: Δt=1, not occupied, since occupied only at u=12-15.\n\ny=2 at u=1: occupied? y=2 occupied only at u=2, not at u=1.\n\nSimilarly, all rows except as above.\n\nAt u=1, no row is occupied, I think.\n\ny=1: not occ at u=1\n\ny=2: occ only u=2\n\n...\n\ny=7: occ u=4,5\n\netc.\n\nSo at u=1, all rows are safe.\n\nSimilarly, at u=0, safe except we are on y=3, not occ.\n\nBut at u=2, only y=1 is safe for us, since others occupied.\n\ny=0 is also safe, but y=1 is fine.\n\nNow, to be at y=1 at u=2 (turn 78), we need to have y_{77} such that we can move to y=1.\n\ny_{77} must be 1 or 2.\n\nIf y_{77}=1, then at u=1, turn 77, we are on y=1, which is safe, and we can choose S to stay at y=1 for u=2, or D to y=0.\n\nIf y_{77}=2, then we choose D to go to y=1.\n\nBut y_{77} at u=1, turn 77.\n\nNow, y_{77} depends on action at u=0, turn 76.\n\nAt turn 76, y=3, we can choose U, S, or D.\n\nIf we choose D, then y_{77}=2.\n\nIf we choose S, y_{77}=3.\n\nIf U, y_{77}=4.\n\nTo have y_{77}=1 or 2, since from y=3, we can go directly to y=2 with D, or to y=3 with S, or y=4 with U.\n\nWe cannot go to y=1 directly from y=3; only to 2,3,4.\n\nSo y_{77} can be 2,3,4.\n\nThus, to have y_{77}=1 or 2, only possible if y_{77}=2 (by choosing D at t=76).\n\nThen from y_{77}=2, we can choose D to go to y_{78}=1.\n\nIf we choose S at t=76, y_{77}=3, then from there, to go to y_{78}=1, we need to go down twice, but from y_{77}=3, we can go D to y=2 at u=2, but y=2 is occupied at u=2, not good; or to y=1? From y=3, D to y=2, but that takes two steps: at u=1, from y=3 D to y=2 at u=2? No.\n\nAt turn 77, if y_{77}=3, we choose action, then y_{78} set.\n\nIf we choose D at turn 77, y_{78}=3-1=2.\n\nBut at u=2, y=2 is occupied.\n\nIf we choose S, y_{78}=3, occupied.\n\nU, y_{78}=4, occupied.\n\nAll bad.\n\nSimilarly, if we go U at t=76, y_{77}=4, then at t=77, whatever, y_{78}=3,4, or5, all occupied.\n\nSo only possible: at t=76, choose D, so y_{77}=2.\n\nThen at t=77, choose D, so y_{78}=1.\n\nThus, we must go down to y=1 by turn 78.\n\nNow, from there, we need to go up to y=9.\n\nBut we have to avoid y=7 and 8 at u=4 and u=5.\n\nu=4 is turn 80 (76+4), u=5 is turn 81.\n\nAt u=2, turn 78, y=1.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal additional turns: from y=1 to y=9, need 8 steps up, so at least 8 turns after u=2, so at u=10, y=9.\n\nBut we can go faster? No, since each up move increases y by one.\n\nFrom u=2, y=1, after k up moves, y=1+k, at time u=2+k.\n\nSet to reach y=9, 1+k=9, k=8, so at time u=2+8=10, y=9.\n\nBut we need to check if we can do it without collision, and also avoid the occupied times.\n\nNow, during the way, we might be on rows at bad times.\n\nSpecifically, we need to not be on y=7 or 8 at u=4 or u=5.\n\nu=4 and u=5 are early times.\n\nu=2: y=1\n\nThen after actions, time increases.\n\nAt u=2, y=1\n\nThen at u=3, y could be 0,1,2 depending on action.\n\nBut we want to go up, so probably U to y=2 at u=3.\n\ny=2 at u=3: is it occupied?\n\ny=2 occupied only at u=2, not at u=3, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\nu=3 is turn 79.\n\nNow, y=7 and 8 occupied at u=4 and u=5.\n\nu=4: turn 80, u=5: turn 81.\n\nWe need to not be on y=7 or 8 at those turns.\n\nSince we are going up from y=1 at u=2.\n\nIf we go up every turn:\n\nu=2: y=1\n\nAction U: u=3, y=2\n\nAction U: u=4, y=3\n\nBut u=4, y=3: is y=3 occupied? y=3 occupied only at u=2, not at u=4, so safe.\n\nAction U: u=5, y=4\n\nu=5, y=4: occupied? y=4 occ only u=2, not u=5, safe.\n\nAction U: u=6, y=5, safe similarly.\n\nAction U: u=7, y=6, safe.\n\nAction U: u=8, y=7\n\nNow u=8, y=7.\n\nBut y=7 occupied at u=4 and u=5, not at u=8, so safe? u=8 is later.\n\nSimilarly, action U: u=9, y=8\n\nu=9, y=8 occupied at u=4,5, not u=9, safe.\n\nAction U: u=10, y=9, goal.\n\nNow, what about u=4 and u=5?\n\nIn this sequence, at u=4, y=3, which is not 7 or 8, and not occupied since occ only u=2.\n\nSimilarly u=5, y=4, not 7 or 8, safe.\n\nSo no problem?\n\nBut we have y=7 at u=8, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly y=8 at u=9.\n\nAnd u=10 y=9.\n\nBut let's list the turns.\n\nTurn t=76: u=0, y=3, action D (to go down)\n\nAfter action, at t=77: u=1, y=2? Let's sequence.\n\nTurn t=76: position y=3, choose action a_{76}. We choose D, so y_{77} = 3 + (-1) = 2? y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nΔy for D is -1.\n\nSo at turn t=76, y=3, after action D, y_{77} = 2.\n\nThen at turn t=77, y=2, choose action a_{77}. We choose D, so y_{78} = 2 + (-1) =1.\n\nThen at turn t=78, y=1, choose action. Now we go up: U, so y_{79} =1 +1=2.\n\nTurn t=78: y=1, action U, so y_{79}=2.\n\nThen turn t=79: y=2, action U, so y_{80}=3.\n\nt=79: y=2, action U, y_{80}=3.\n\nThen turn t=80: y=3, action U, y_{81}=4.\n\nt=80: u=4, since t=76+4=80, Δt=4.\n\ny=3 at u=4, not occupied, ok.\n\nThen action U, y_{81}=4.\n\nTurn t=81: y=4, action U, y_{82}=5.\n\nt=81: u=5, y=4, not occupied, ok.\n\nThen U, y_{82}=5.\n\nt=82: y=5, action U, y_{83}=6.\n\nThen t=83: y=6, action U, y_{84}=7.\n\nt=83: u=7? t=76, u=0; t=77,u=1; t=78,u=2; t=79,u=3; t=80,u=4; t=81,u=5; t=82,u=6; t=83,u=7; t=84,u=8.\n\ny=7 at u=8.\n\nThen t=84: y=7, action U, y_{85}=8.\n\nt=84: u=8, y=7, safe.\n\nAction U, y_{85}=8.\n\nt=85: y=8, u=9? t=85 = 76 + 9, u=9.\n\ny=8 at u=9, not occupied (occ at u=4,5), safe.\n\nAction U, y_{86}=9.\n\nt=86: y=9, u=10, reached.\n\nBut we reached at t=86, with y=9 at turn 86.\n\nNow, H is the number of turns? From t=76 to t=86, how many actions?\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=76 to t=85, for H actions to reach at t=76 + H.\n\ny at turn t is after actions up to t-1.\n\nStart at t=76, y=3.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t=76 + H, y_{76+H} =9.\n\nIn this case, at t=86, y=9, so 76 + H =86, H=10.\n\nActions: from t=76 to t=85, 10 actions? t=76 to t=85 inclusive is 10 turns: 76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85.\n\nAfter 10 actions, at t=86, y=9.\n\nThe minimal possible is 6, but we took 10 because of detour down.\n\nBut in this sequence, we avoided the problems.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nFor example, after being at y=1 at u=2, can we go up faster or avoid the u=4,5 issue, but in this case it was fine.\n\nBut u=4 and u=5 are early, and we were on low rows.\n\nIn the sequence above, at u=4, we were on y=3, which is fine.\n\nBut we have to go through y=7 and 8 later, but no problem.\n\nBut H=10 seems long.\n\nPerhaps I can go up immediately after u=2.\n\nAnother point: at u=4 and u=5, y=7 and 8 are occupied, but if I can be on higher rows earlier.\n\nBut from y=1 at u=2, I need to go to y=9.\n\nThe earliest to reach y=9 is at u=8: y=1 + 7 =8? From u=2 y=1, after 7 up moves: u=3 y=2, u=4 y=3, u=5 y=4, u=6 y=5, u=7 y=6, u=8 y=7, u=9 y=8, u=10 y=9. So still u=10.\n\nIf I go up faster, but I can only move one per turn, so minimum 8 steps from y=1 to y=9, so at least u=10 for y=9.\n\nFrom u=2 to u=10, 8 steps, y from 1 to 9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the sequence above, we have to go down first, so from u=0 to u=2, we went down to y=1.\n\nTotal from u=0 y=3 to u=10 y=9, 10 turns.\n\nBut perhaps I can reach earlier by not going down, but we have to avoid u=2 on middle rows.\n\nAnother idea: at u=2, I could be on y=0, but y=0 is also safe, but going down to y=0 might not help, similar.\n\nOr, I could go up to y=7 or above before u=4.\n\nBut at u=2, I can only be at y=1, as we must.\n\nFrom u=0, in two steps, I can only be at y=1,2,3,4,5, and only y=1 is safe at u=2.\n\nSo I must be at y=1 at u=2.\n\nNo choice.\n\nThus, the sequence must include going down to y=1 by u=2.\n\nThen from there up to y=9 in 8 steps.\n\nBut in the up path, I need to avoid y=7 and 8 at u=4 and u=5, but since at u=4 I am at y=3 or so, it's fine.\n\nIn my earlier sequence, at u=4, y=3, which is not 7 or 8, and not occupied, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, no issue with other rows.\n\nBut what about y=1 at later times? At u=12 to 15, but u=12 is t=88, which is after u=10, so I am already at y=9 by then.\n\nSimilarly, no problem.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have 10 actions.\n\nBut let me confirm the actions:\n\nTurn t=76: action D, to y=2 at t=77\n\nt=77: action D, to y=1 at t=78\n\nt=78: action U, to y=2 at t=79\n\nt=79: action U, to y=3 at t=80\n\nt=80: action U, to y=4 at t=81\n\nt=81: action U, to y=5 at t=82\n\nt=82: action U, to y=6 at t=83\n\nt=83: action U, to y=7 at t=84\n\nt=84: action U, to y=8 at t=85\n\nt=85: action U, to y=9 at t=86\n\nSo actions from t=76 to t=85: D, D, U, U, U, U, U, U, U, U\n\nThat's 10 actions.\n\nBut at t=80, u=4, y=3? Let's list the position at each turn.\n\nAt turn t=76: y=3 (given)\n\nAfter a_{76}=D, y_{77}=2\n\nAt turn t=77: y=2\n\nAfter a_{77}=D, y_{78}=1\n\nAt turn t=78: y=1\n\nAfter a_{78}=U, y_{79}=2\n\nAt turn t=79: y=2\n\nAfter a_{79}=U, y_{80}=3\n\nAt turn t=80: y=3\n\nAfter a_{80}=U, y_{81}=4\n\nAt turn t=81: y=4\n\nAfter a_{81}=U, y_{82}=5\n\nAt turn t=82: y=5\n\nAfter a_{82}=U, y_{83}=6\n\nAt turn t=83: y=6\n\nAfter a_{83}=U, y_{84}=7\n\nAt turn t=84: y=7\n\nAfter a_{84}=U, y_{85}=8\n\nAt turn t=85: y=8\n\nAfter a_{85}=U, y_{86}=9\n\nAt turn t=86: y=9, reached.\n\nNow, check collision:\n\nt=76: y=3, u=0, not occ.\n\nt=77: y=2, u=1, not occ (occ only u=2)\n\nt=78: y=1, u=2, not occ (occ u=12-15)\n\nt=79: y=2, u=3, not occ (occ only u=2)\n\nt=80: y=3, u=4, not occ (occ only u=2)\n\nt=81: y=4, u=5, not occ\n\nt=82: y=5, u=6, not occ\n\nt=83: y=6, u=7, not occ\n\nt=84: y=7, u=8, not occ (occ u=4,5)\n\nt=85: y=8, u=9, not occ\n\nt=86: y=9, no cars.\n\nAll safe.\n\nBut H=10, from t=76 to t=85 actions, 10 actions.\n\nBut can I do with less?\n\nFor example, after reaching y=1 at u=2, can I go up faster? No, because I need to increase y by 8, min 8 steps.\n\nFrom start, if I could reach higher row earlier.\n\nBut at u=2, I must be low.\n\nPerhaps I can go down only once or something, but at u=2, if I am on y=2, it is occupied, so I must not be, so must be y=1 or less.\n\ny=0 possible.\n\nBut similar.\n\nFor example, at t=76, D to y=2 at t=77.\n\nThen at t=77, instead of D, I go S or U, but if S, y=2 at t=78, occupied; if U, y=3 at t=78, occupied. Both bad.\n\nSo must go down to y=1.\n\nThus, min H is 10.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach y=9 earlier by going up after avoiding u=2.\n\nAnother idea: at u=2, be on y=1, then go up, but at u=4 and u=5, if I can be on y=9 or something, but impossible, since from y=1 at u=2, at u=4 I can be at most y=1+2=3, since two steps: u=2 to u=3 y=2, u=3 to u=4 y=3 or less.\n\nSimilarly, at u=5, y=4 max from there.\n\nSo I cannot be on high rows at u=4 and u=5, so no issue, I am on low rows, safe.\n\nThus, the sequence above should be fine.\n\nBut in the actions, I have two downs and then eight ups, total 10 actions.\n\nBut the problem asks for minimal H, and the sequence.\n\nPerhaps I can stay somewhere to avoid, but staying might not reduce H.\n\nFor example, if at some point I stay, it takes more turns.\n\nSo min H should be 10.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on y=6.\n\ny=6 has two cars, but we saw only one matters, occupied at u=2.\n\nIn the sequence, we passed y=6 at t=83, u=7, not u=2, fine.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nPerhaps I can go up directly after y=1, but skip some rows if possible, but no, I have to go through each.\n\nAnother thought: at u=4 and u=5, y=7 and 8 are occupied, but since I am below, no problem.\n\nAnd when I reach y=7 and 8 later, it is safe.\n\nSo I think H=10 is minimal.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach in 9 actions.\n\nSuppose H=9, then at t=76 +9 = t=85, y=9.\n\nBut from y=3 to y=9 in 9 actions? With actions, min 6 up, but with constraints.\n\nAt u=0, y=3.\n\nAfter 9 actions, at t=85, y=9.\n\nBut at u=2, t=78, I must be on y=1.\n\nNow, from u=0 to u=2, I need to go to y=1, which requires two down actions, but from y=3 to y=1, net down 2, so at least two actions down.\n\nThen from y=1 at u=2 to y=9 at u= something.\n\ny=9 at turn t=85, u=85-76=9.\n\nAt u=9, y=9.\n\nNow, from u=2 to u=9, 7 steps.\n\ny from 1 to 9, need 8 increases, but in 7 steps, I can increase by at most 7, so y<=1+7=8 at u=9.\n\nCannot reach y=9 in 7 steps from y=1.\n\nFrom u=2 to u=9, the turns: at u=2, position y=1.\n\nAfter action at u=2, to u=3, y changes, and so on, up to action at u=8, to position at u=9.\n\nThe position at u=9 is after 7 actions from u=2.\n\nActions from t=78 to t=84? Let's see.\n\nAt time u=2, turn t=78, y=1.\n\nWe perform action a_{78}, which sets y_{79}.\n\nThen a_{79} sets y_{80}, ..., up to a_{84} sets y_{85}.\n\ny_{85} at u=9.\n\nTo have y_{85}=9.\n\nStarting from y_{78}=1.\n\nAfter 7 actions, y_{85} = 1 + net up.\n\nEach U increases by 1, D decreases, S same.\n\nTo reach 9 from 1, need +8, so must have 8 up actions, but only 7 actions? From a_{78} to a_{84}, that's 7 actions.\n\nt=78 to t=84 inclusive, 7 actions: a_{78}, a_{79}, ..., a_{84}, that sets y_{79} to y_{85}.\n\ny_{85} = y_{78} + sum of Δy from t=78 to 84.\n\n7 actions.\n\nMax increase: 7, so y_{85} <= 1+7=8 <9, cannot reach y=9.\n\nThus, impossible to reach y=9 at u=9 with y=1 at u=2.\n\nEarliest is u=10, y=9.\n\nSimilarly, if I reach y=9 later, H larger.\n\nSo min H=10.\n\nThus the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to list the actions from t=76 onwards.\n\nt_1=76.\n\nActions: a_{76}, a_{77}, ..., a_{85}\n\nWith H=10 actions.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 76: D\n\nTurn 77: D\n\nTurn 78: U\n\nTurn 79: U\n\nTurn 80: U\n\nTurn 81: U\n\nTurn 82: U\n\nTurn 83: U\n\nTurn 84: U\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nThen at turn 86, y=9.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, I think.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt from 0 to H-1.\n\nFor t=0, a_{t_1 +0} = a_{76}\n\nt=1, a_{77}, ..., t=9, a_{85}\n\nAnd after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position is (0,9)\n\nIn this case, H=10.\n\nNow, actions as above.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have two D and then eight U.\n\nBut let me write in the box.\n\nBut in the car state, for y=7 and y=8, we have two cars, but only one matters, as we used.\n\nIn y=6, there is a second car at (48,37,right,12), but we saw it never covers 0.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo I think fine.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=0 instead of y=1, but similar.\n\nOr, at some point, I can stay to avoid, but no need.\n\nSo minimal H is 10.\n\nBut let's see if I can save one turn by going up faster after.\n\nFor example, from y=1 at u=2, go U,U,U,... but as before.\n\nIf I go directly up, it takes 8 ups.\n\nPerhaps at the beginning, instead of going down, I go up to y=4 or something, but at u=2, I must not be on 2-6, so if I go up, I am on higher y, which is bad.\n\nFor example, if at t=76, I go U to y=4 at t=77.\n\nThen at t=77, y=4, u=1, safe.\n\nBut then at t=78, u=2, if I go U to y=5, occupied; D to y=3, occupied; S to y=4, occupied. All bad.\n\nNo escape.\n\nSimilarly, if I go S at first, y=3 at t=77, then at t=78, same problem.\n\nOnly going down works.\n\nThus, the sequence is necessary.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\nTo reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 76\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 10. The sequence of actions minimizes \\(H\\) by first moving down to avoid the collision at \\(\\Delta t = 2\\) (turn \\(t = 78\\)) on rows \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 6\\), which are all occupied at that time. After reaching \\(y = 1\\) at turn \\(78\\), the player moves up consistently to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn \\(86\\).\n\nThe action sequence is determined as follows:\n- At turn \\(76\\), move down (D) to position \\(y = 2\\) at turn \\(77\\).\n- At turn \\(77\\), move down (D) to position \\(y = 1\\) at turn \\(78\\), avoiding the collision at \\(\\Delta t = 2\\) since \\(y = 1\\) is not occupied at that time.\n- From turn \\(78\\) to turn \\(85\\), move up (U) each turn to increase \\(y\\) by 1 per turn, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(86\\).\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions:\n- At \\(\\Delta t = 4\\) and \\(\\Delta t = 5\\) (turns \\(80\\) and \\(81\\)), the player is on \\(y = 3\\) and \\(y = 4\\), respectively, which are not occupied at those times (only at \\(\\Delta t = 2\\)).\n- The player passes \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) at \\(\\Delta t = 8\\) and \\(\\Delta t = 9\\) (turns \\(84\\) and \\(85\\)), which are safe as these rows are only occupied at \\(\\Delta t = 4\\) and \\(\\Delta t = 5\\).\n\nThe actions are listed for turns \\(t_1 + t\\) where \\(t\\) ranges from \\(0\\) to \\(H-1 = 9\\).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 76: D \\\\\nTurn 77: D \\\\\nTurn 78: U \\\\\nTurn 79: U \\\\\nTurn 80: U \\\\\nTurn 81: U \\\\\nTurn 82: U \\\\\nTurn 83: U \\\\\nTurn 84: U \\\\\nTurn 85: U\n}",

The current turn is t1 = 78, and I start at y=0.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. There are cars on each freeway from 1 to 8, with given positions and speeds at turn 78. I need to find out where these cars will be at future turns to avoid them when I'm on that row.\n\nThe collision happens only if at the turn when I'm on a freeway, the car's span includes 0. Also, when I move to a new row, I'm not considered on that row until the next turn, so I only care about the row I'm currently on for collision.\n\nLet me denote the turn relative to t1. So at turn t=0 (which is t1=78), I'm at y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 by some turn H, so after H actions, I should be at y=9.\n\ny starts at 0, and each action changes y by +1, -1, or 0. To go from 0 to 9, the minimum number of actions would be 9 if I only go up, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 9.\n\nH is the number of turns, so after H actions, I'm at turn t1 + H - 1? Let's clarify the indexing.\n\nThe sequence is for turns from t1 to t1 + H - 1, and after H actions, at turn t1 + H, I should be at (0,9)? No.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1 to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nLet's parse this.\n\nThe actions are from turn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so that's H actions: from turn t1 to turn t1 + H - 1.\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + H - 1}, at turn t1 + H, the position is updated, so y_{t1 + H} is the position after H actions.\n\nBut the target is y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nLet's see: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\"\n\nFrom the task: \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nAnd actions are for t=0 to H-1, meaning from turn t1 to turn t1 + H - 1.\n\nAt turn t, before action a_t, the position is y_t, then after action, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nStandard: at time t, state is y_t, take action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nSo for turn t, position y_t.\n\nWe start at turn t1, y_{t1} = 0.\n\nAfter actions a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1 + H - 1}, we have y_{t1 + H} = something, but we want y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\ny_{t1 + H - 1} = 9 means that at the beginning of turn t1 + H - 1, we are at position 9, and we take action a_{t1 + H - 1}, which might change it, but since we are already at 9, and we need to be at (0,9), I think we can be at 9 and stay or whatever, but the position is given as (x,y), but x is always 0, I think, since the player is at x=0 always? From the dynamics, it only talks about y, and cars are on freeways with spans, but the player is at (0,y), so x=0 fixed.\n\nIn the collision, it says \"for any car on freeway y_T\", and collision if 0 in span at turn T.\n\nSo player is always at x=0.\n\nBack to timing.\n\nWe want at some turn T, y_T = 9, and T = t1 + H - 1 for some H.\n\nAfter the sequence of H actions, we are at turn t1 + H - 1 with y=9.\n\nThen, since we are at (0,9), and no freeway above, I think we are done, no need to take action at that turn or something? But the sequence includes actions up to turn t1 + H - 1, and at that turn, we are at position y_{t1 + H - 1}, which should be 9.\n\nIf at turn t1 + H - 1, y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9, then we have reached the goal at that turn, before taking action. But since we are at (0,9), and there are no cars or anything, we don't need to move further. The action at that turn might be S, or U or D, but y=9, U would try to go to 10, but y in [0,9], so probably U is invalid or clamped, but from the update, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy with y in [0,9], so if y=9 and U, it should stay 9? Not specified, but I think we assume that y is clamped, so if y=9 and U, y_{t+1}=9, similarly for y=0 and D.\n\nBut for the goal, since we want to be at (0,9), and at turn t1 + H - 1, y=9, we are there.\n\nNow, to minimize H, the number of actions, which is the number of turns from t1 to t1 + H - 1, so H turns.\n\nH is the number of actions, so for H actions, we cover turns t1 to t1 + H - 1.\n\nMinimal H means minimal number of actions to reach y=9 from y=0.\n\nBut due to cars, we might need extra moves.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars at t1=78.\n\nFor each freeway k, there are cars with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: right or left.\n\nFor left-moving, span is [h, τ] with h > τ? Let's see the update.\n\nFor left-moving car: at turn t1, span [h, τ], then at T, [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSince left-moving, it's moving left, so h decreases.\n\nIn the span, for left-moving, it says [h, τ] and τ - s(T-t1) to h - s(T-t1), but which is head and tail?\n\nIt says: \"head is at h, tail at τ\" and for left-moving, span at T is [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] where ΔT = T - t1.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], with head at h, tail at τ.\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nDirection is right, so head h= -48, tail τ= -59? But for right-moving, if it's moving right, head should be on the right, so if head at h, tail at τ, and moving right, then h > τ, I assume.\n\nIn freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3), -48 > -59, so h = -48, τ = -59, and direction right.\n\nAt turn T, span = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-59 + 3ΔT, -48 + 3ΔT]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] if h > τ.\n\nBut let's confirm the direction notation.\n\nFor freeway 6, there is a car (0, -11, right, 12), so at t1, head=0, tail=-11, so span [ -11, 0 ] for right-moving? Let's see the update.\n\nGeneral: for a car, at t1, head h, tail τ.\n\nFor right-moving (d=right), at T, span [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nFor left-moving (d=left), at T, span [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3), so h=-48, τ=-59, d=right, s=3.\n\nAt T, span = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-59 + 3ΔT, -48 + 3ΔT]\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: (48,37,right,12), h=48, τ=37, d=right, s=12, span at T: [37 +12ΔT, 48 +12ΔT]\n\nFreeway 3 same as 2: (48,37,right,12)\n\nFreeway 4 same: (48,37,right,12)\n\nFreeway 5 same: (48,37,right,12)\n\nFreeway 6: two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst car: same as above, [37+12ΔT, 48+12ΔT]\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12), h=0, τ=-11, d=right, s=12, span at T: [-11 +12ΔT, 0 +12ΔT] = [12ΔT -11, 12ΔT]\n\nFreeway 7: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nFirst car: h=-48, τ=-59, d=right, s=6, span [ -59 +6ΔT, -48 +6ΔT]\n\nSecond car: h=0, τ=-11, d=right, s=6, span [ -11 +6ΔT, 0 +6ΔT] = [6ΔT -11, 6ΔT]\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if we are on freeway y_T at that turn, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\nWe are on freeway y_T at turn T when we are at row y_T.\n\nThe player position y_t is the row at turn t.\n\nAt turn t, we are on row y_t.\n\nCollision if at turn t, for the row k = y_t, there is a car on k such that 0 in span of that car at turn t.\n\nAlso, note that when we move, at turn t, we are on row y_t, take action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, so at turn t+1, we are on row y_{t+1}.\n\nWe are not on y_{t+1} at turn t, only at turn t+1.\n\nSo for collision at turn t, it depends on y_t and the cars on row y_t at turn t.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 at t=78 to y=9 at some turn T=78 + H -1.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars, only freeways 1-8 have cars.\n\ny=0 is the starting point, no freeway, I think, and y=9 is the target, also no cars.\n\nFreeways are from y=1 to y=8.\n\nAt y=0, we start, no collision possible, similarly at y=9.\n\nWe need to cross rows 1 to 8.\n\nEach action changes y by at most 1, so we have to visit each row in between, but we can skip rows if we move fast, but since Δy is ±1 or 0, we can only change by one row per turn or stay.\n\nSo we must pass through each integer y from 0 to 9, but we might stay on a row for multiple turns.\n\nTo go from 0 to 9, minimum 9 actions if no waiting, but we may need to wait to avoid cars.\n\nH must be at least 9.\n\nNow, the cars are moving, so I need to find times when for a given row, at that turn, no car has 0 in its span.\n\nSince the cars are periodic or something, but speeds are different, so I need to compute for each row the times when it is safe to be there.\n\nLet Δt = t - 78, so relative turn from 0.\n\nFor each freeway k, I need when 0 is not in any car's span at turn Δt.\n\nFreeway 1: only one car: span [ -59 + 3Δt, -48 + 3Δt ]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 3Δt <= 0 <= -48 + 3Δt\n\nSo -59 + 3Δt <= 0 and 0 <= -48 + 3Δt\n\nFirst: -59 + 3Δt <= 0 => 3Δt <= 59 => Δt <= 59/3 = 19.666, so Δt <= 19 since integer\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 + 3Δt => 48 <= 3Δt => Δt >= 16\n\nSo for Δt from 16 to 19 inclusive, 0 is in span, collision.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nΔt >=16 and Δt <=19, so unsafe at Δt=16,17,18,19.\n\nSafe for Δt <=15 or Δt >=20.\n\nFreeway 2: one car (48,37,right,12), span [37 +12Δt, 48 +12Δt]\n\n0 in span if 37 +12Δt <= 0 <= 48 +12Δt\n\nBut 37 +12Δt <=0? 12Δt <= -37, Δt <= -37/12 = -3.083, but Δt >=0, so impossible. Similarly, 0 <= 48 +12Δt always true for Δt>=0.\n\nBut 37 +12Δt <=0 only if Δt negative, not possible. So 0 is never <= 37 +12Δt? Let's see the inequality.\n\n0 in [L,R] if L <= 0 <= R.\n\nHere L = 37 +12Δt, R=48+12Δt\n\nSince Δt >=0, L >=37 >0, so L >0, thus 0 < L <= R, so 0 < L, so 0 not in [L,R] because L >0.\n\nSimilarly, for freeways 3,4,5, same as freeway 2: all have car (48,37,right,12), so same, L=37+12Δt >=37>0, so 0 not in span ever. So these freeways are always safe? But let's confirm.\n\nFreeway 2: car span [37+12Δt, 48+12Δt], since min is 37>0, and increasing, so always >0, never contains 0. So no car can cause collision on freeway 2, similarly for 3,4,5.\n\nBut freeway 2 has only this car, so yes, freeway 2 is always safe, no collision possible.\n\nSimilarly freeway 3,4,5 same.\n\nNow freeway 6: two cars.\n\nFirst car: same as above, (48,37,right,12), span [37+12Δt, 48+12Δt], always >0, so never contains 0.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,12), span [ -11 +12Δt, 0 +12Δt] = [12Δt -11, 12Δt]\n\n0 in span if 12Δt -11 <= 0 <= 12Δt\n\nWhich is always true for the right part: 0 <= 12Δt since Δt>=0.\n\nLeft: 12Δt -11 <=0 => 12Δt <=11 => Δt <= 11/12 <1, so Δt=0 only? Δt integer, Δt=0: 12*0 -11 = -11 <=0 <=0, yes 0<=0 true.\n\nΔt=1: 12-11=1 <=0? 1<=0 false, so 0 not <= L? L=12Δt-11, R=12Δt\n\n0 in [L,R] iff L<=0 and 0<=R.\n\n0<=R always for Δt>=0.\n\nL<=0 iff 12Δt -11 <=0 iff 12Δt <=11 iff Δt <= 11/12 <1, so only Δt=0.\n\nAt Δt=0, L= -11 <=0, R=0, 0<=0, so 0 in [ -11, 0 ], yes.\n\nFor Δt>=1, L=12Δt-11 >=12-11=1>0, so L>0, 0 not in span.\n\nSo for second car, unsafe only at Δt=0.\n\nFirst car always safe.\n\nSo on freeway 6, unsafe only when the second car has 0 in span, which is at Δt=0.\n\nAt other times, safe.\n\nΔt=0 is turn t=78.\n\nBut at turn t=78, we are at y=0, not on freeway 6, so for freeway 6, if we are there at Δt=0, it would be unsafe, but we are not, so for future times, when we are on freeway 6, Δt >=1, which is safe.\n\nSo freeway 6 is safe for all Δt except possibly if we were there at Δt=0, but we won't be.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,6), span [ -59 +6Δt, -48 +6Δt ]\n\n0 in span if -59 +6Δt <= 0 <= -48 +6Δt\n\nSo -59 +6Δt <=0 => 6Δt <=59 => Δt <= 59/6 = 9.833, so Δt <=9\n\nAnd 0 <= -48 +6Δt => 48 <=6Δt => Δt >=8\n\nSo for Δt from 8 to 9 inclusive, unsafe.\n\nΔt >=8 and <=9, so Δt=8,9.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,6), span [ -11 +6Δt, 0 +6Δt] = [6Δt -11, 6Δt]\n\n0 in span if 6Δt -11 <=0 and 0<=6Δt\n\n0<=6Δt always for Δt>=0.\n\n6Δt -11 <=0 => 6Δt <=11 => Δt <= 11/6 ≈1.833, so Δt=0,1\n\nAt Δt=0: L= -11 <=0, R=0, 0 in\n\nΔt=1: L=6-11=-5<=0, R=6, 0<=6, 0 in [-5,6]\n\nΔt=2: L=12-11=1>0, 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSo unsafe for Δt=0 and Δt=1.\n\nNow for freeway 7, unsafe if either car has collision.\n\nFirst car unsafe at Δt=8,9\n\nSecond car unsafe at Δt=0,1\n\nSo overall, unsafe at Δt=0,1,8,9\n\nSafe otherwise.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same as freeway 7, since same cars: (-48,-59,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6), so unsafe at Δt=0,1,8,9\n\nNow freeway 1: we had unsafe at Δt=16,17,18,19\n\nFreeway 2: always safe\n\nFreeway 3: always safe\n\nFreeway 4: always safe\n\nFreeway 5: always safe\n\nFreeway 6: unsafe only at Δt=0, but since we are not there at Δt=0, safe for all practical purposes.\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe at Δt=0,1,8,9\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at Δt=0,1,8,9\n\nWe start at y=0, Δt=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe path must avoid being on a row when it is unsafe for that row at that turn.\n\nSince we can choose when to move, we need to sequence the rows we visit and when.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to go up as fast as possible, but may need to wait on safe rows.\n\nFirst, rows that are always safe: freeway 2,3,4,5 are always safe, no cars or cars never at 0.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4,5: each has a car but it never covers 0, so yes, always safe to be on these rows at any time.\n\nFreeway 6: safe except at Δt=0, but since Δt>=1 when we might be there, safe.\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe at Δt=16-19, safe otherwise.\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe at Δt=0,1,8,9\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at Δt=0,1,8,9\n\nWe start at y=0, which is safe, at Δt=0.\n\ny=0 is not a freeway, so no issue.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=2,3,4,5 are always safe, we can be there at any time without problem.\n\ny=1 and y=6 may have restrictions, y=7 and y=8 have unsafe times.\n\ny=1 is freeway 1, which has unsafe times at Δt=16-19.\n\ny=6 is freeway 6, which is safe after Δt=0.\n\ny=7 and y=8 unsafe at Δt=0,1,8,9.\n\nSince we start at Δt=0, and y=0, we need to go to y=1 at some point.\n\nThe critical part is to avoid the unsafe times for the rows we are on.\n\nTo go from y=0 to y=1, we need to move up to y=1 at some turn.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSince we can stay or move, we need to find a sequence of actions.\n\nTo minimize H, we should go up as much as possible, but avoid being on unsafe rows at unsafe times.\n\nFirst, let's list the unsafe periods for each row:\n\n- Row 1 (freeway 1): unsafe Δt=16,17,18,19\n\n- Row 2: always safe\n\n- Row 3: always safe\n\n- Row 4: always safe\n\n- Row 5: always safe\n\n- Row 6: always safe (since unsafe only at Δt=0, not relevant)\n\n- Row 7 (freeway 7): unsafe Δt=0,1,8,9\n\n- Row 8 (freeway 8): unsafe Δt=0,1,8,9\n\nRow 6 is freeway 6, which we said is safe for Δt>=1.\n\nNow, rows 2,3,4,5,6 are safe at all times we care about.\n\nRows 7 and 8 are unsafe at Δt=8,9 and also 0,1 but we won't be there early.\n\nWe start at y=0, Δt=0.\n\nAt Δt=0, we are at y=0.\n\nWe can take action at turn Δt=0 to go to y=1 or stay or down, but down to y=-1 not possible, so only S or U.\n\nIf we go up to y=1 at Δt=0, then at turn Δt=0, we are on row y=1? At turn t, before action, y_t, then action, then y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn Δt=0 (t=78), position y=0.\n\nWe take action a_{78}.\n\nIf a_{78} = U, then y_{79} = 1.\n\nIf a_{78} = S, y_{79} = 0.\n\nIf a_{78} = D, y_{79} = 0, since y=0 min.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with y in [0,9], so if y_t=0 and D, y_{t+1}=0.\n\nSimilarly for 9 and U.\n\nAt turn Δt=0, we are on row y=0, which is not a freeway, so no collision.\n\nAfter action, at turn Δt=1 (t=79), we are on row y_{79}.\n\nCollision depends on y_{79} and the cars on that row at turn t=79, which is Δt=1.\n\nNow, for row 1, at Δt=1, is it safe?\n\nRow 1 unsafe only at Δt=16-19, so at Δt=1, it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince rows 2,3,4,5,6 are always safe, we can pass through them quickly.\n\nThe only potential delays are at row 1,7,8 due to unsafe times.\n\nRow 1 has unsafe at Δt=16-19, so we should avoid being on row 1 during those times.\n\nSimilarly, row 7 and 8 unsafe at Δt=8,9.\n\nΔt=8 and 9 are early, since we start at Δt=0.\n\nWe need to go from y=0 to y=1, then to y=2, etc.\n\nTo minimize time, we should go up as fast as possible, but if we go up immediately, we might hit the unsafe times for row 7 and 8.\n\nLet's see the earliest we can be at each row if we go straight up.\n\nIf we always go up:\n\nStart Δt=0, y=0\n\nAfter action U at Δt=0: y=1 at Δt=1\n\nAction U at Δt=1: y=2 at Δt=2\n\nAction U at Δt=2: y=3 at Δt=3\n\nAction U at Δt=3: y=4 at Δt=4\n\nAction U at Δt=4: y=5 at Δt=5\n\nAction U at Δt=5: y=6 at Δt=6\n\nAction U at Δt=6: y=7 at Δt=7\n\nAction U at Δt=7: y=8 at Δt=8\n\nAction U at Δt=8: y=9 at Δt=9\n\nAt turn Δt=9, y=9, which is the goal, since y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nH-1 = Δt for the turn index.\n\nt = t1 + Δt\n\ny_t = y_{t1 + Δt}\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H -1} =9\n\nSet T = H-1, so at relative turn T, y_T =9.\n\nThen H = T +1 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from Δt=0 to Δt=H-1? Let's define.\n\nSet relative turn τ from 0: τ = t - t1\n\nAt τ=0, y=0\n\nActions a_τ for τ=0 to K-1, then after K actions, y_K is the position at turn t1 + K.\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9, so at relative turn H-1, position 9.\n\nAfter H-1 actions, position y_{t1 + (H-1)} =9.\n\nSince we start at τ=0, y_0=0.\n\nAfter m actions, position at τ=m.\n\nWe want y_M =9 for some M, then H-1 = M, so H = M+1 actions.\n\nM is the relative turn when we reach y=9.\n\ny_M =9.\n\nThe number of actions is M, since from τ=0 to τ=M-1, we take M actions to reach position at τ=M.\n\nStart: τ=0, y_0=0\n\nAfter action a_0, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{M-1}, y_M = y_{M-1} + Δy_{M-1} =9\n\nAnd at turn τ=M, position y_M=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns τ=0 to τ=M-1, H actions? τ from 0 to M-1, that's M actions.\n\nH = number of actions = M.\n\nIn the answer, it should be for turns t1 + τ for τ=0 to H-1.\n\nAnd y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{t1 + (H-1)} =9.\n\nWith relative τ, at τ=H-1, y=9.\n\nSince τ=H-1, and we start at τ=0.\n\nTo minimize H, we minimize the turn when we reach y=9, so minimize τ_final where y_{τ_final} =9.\n\nτ_final = H-1.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nIf we go straight up:\n\nAt τ=0: y=0, action U, then y=1 at τ=1\n\nτ=1: y=1, action U, y=2 at τ=2\n\nτ=2: y=2, U, y=3 at τ=3\n\nτ=3: y=3, U, y=4 at τ=4\n\nτ=4: y=4, U, y=5 at τ=5\n\nτ=5: y=5, U, y=6 at τ=6\n\nτ=6: y=6, U, y=7 at τ=7\n\nτ=7: y=7, action U, then y=8 at τ=8\n\nτ=8: y=8, action U, then y=9 at τ=9\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt each turn, when we are on a row, check if collision.\n\nAt turn τ, position y_τ.\n\nFor τ=0: y=0, not freeway, safe.\n\nτ=1: y=1, row 1. At τ=1, row 1 is safe, since unsafe only at 16-19.\n\nτ=2: y=2, row 2, always safe.\n\nτ=3: y=3, row 3, safe.\n\nτ=4: y=4, row 4, safe.\n\nτ=5: y=5, row 5, safe.\n\nτ=6: y=6, row 6, safe (as we said)\n\nτ=7: y=7, row 7. At τ=7, row 7 unsafe? Row 7 unsafe at τ=0,1,8,9.\n\nτ=7: not in {0,1,8,9}, so should be safe? τ=7.\n\nUnsafe at τ=0,1,8,9, so τ=7 is not in that set, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, τ=8: y=8, row 8. Row 8 unsafe at τ=0,1,8,9.\n\nAt τ=8, y=8, which is row 8, and τ=8 is unsafe time.\n\nCollision!\n\nAt τ=8, we are on row 8, and it is unsafe.\n\nSpecifically, row 8 at τ=8: freeway 8, cars: at τ=8, first car span [ -59 +6*8, -48 +6*8] = [ -59+48, -48+48] = [-11, 0]\n\n-11 <=0<=0, yes 0 in [-11,0].\n\nSecond car: [6*8 -11, 6*8] = [48-11,48]=[37,48], 0 not in.\n\nBut first car has 0, so collision.\n\nThus, at τ=8, on row 8, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we go straight, at τ=8 we are on y=8 and unsafe.\n\nIn the sequence above, at τ=8, we are on y=8, which is row 8, and it is unsafe.\n\nThen at τ=8, we take action U to go to y=9, but during turn τ=8, we are on row 8, so collision happens.\n\nWe cannot be there at that time.\n\nIn this case, with straight up, we have collision at τ=8 on row 8.\n\nMoreover, at τ=9, we would be at y=9, but we didn't reach because of collision at τ=8.\n\nBut in the plan, we are at y=8 at τ=8, collision.\n\nSo we need to avoid being on row 8 at τ=8 or τ=9? τ=8 and τ=9 are unsafe for row 8.\n\nSimilarly for row 7 at τ=8,9? Row 7 unsafe at τ=0,1,8,9.\n\nIn the straight path, at τ=7, we are on row 7, which is safe, since τ=7 not unsafe.\n\nThen at τ=7, action U to y=8 at τ=8, but at τ=8, on row 8, unsafe.\n\nSo we need to delay or something.\n\nNow, row 8 is unsafe at τ=8 and τ=9.\n\nWe need to be on row 8 at a safe time.\n\nRow 8 safe except τ=0,1,8,9.\n\nSince τ=0,1 are early, safe times for row 8 are for τ <=7 or τ>=10, but τ>=10 is late.\n\nSimilarly, row 7 safe except τ=0,1,8,9, so safe for τ=2 to7 or τ>=10.\n\nNow, we are at τ=6, y=6 in the straight path, which is safe.\n\nThen at τ=6, we go to y=7 at τ=7.\n\nτ=7, y=7, row 7 safe (τ=7 not in unsafe).\n\nThen at τ=7, if we go to y=8, we arrive at τ=8, but row 8 unsafe at τ=8.\n\nIf we stay on row 7 at τ=7, by doing S.\n\nThen at τ=7, y=7, action S, then y=7 at τ=8.\n\nNow at τ=8, y=7, row 7.\n\nRow 7 at τ=8: unsafe! Because row 7 unsafe at τ=8.\n\nSo if we stay at τ=7, we are on row 7 at τ=8, which is unsafe.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt τ=7, if we are on row 7, and we do S, we stay on row 7 at τ=8.\n\nBut row 7 unsafe at τ=8.\n\nIf we do D, go down to y=6 at τ=8.\n\nThen at τ=8, y=6, row 6, which is safe.\n\nBut we don't want to go down.\n\nBut to avoid collision.\n\nIn the straight path, we reach y=6 at τ=6.\n\nNow, row 7 is safe at τ=7, but if we go to row 7 at τ=7, then at τ=7 we are safe, but then for the next action, at τ=7, if we go up to row 8 at τ=8, unsafe.\n\nIf we stay, at τ=8 we are on row 7, unsafe.\n\nIf we go down to row 6 at τ=8, safe, but we are going down.\n\nThen we need to go up later.\n\nSince row 7 and 8 are unsafe at τ=8 and τ=9, we should be on row 7 before τ=8 or after τ=9.\n\nSimilarly for row 8.\n\nEarliest we can be at row 7.\n\nIf we go up fast:\n\nAt τ=0: y=0, U to y=1 at τ=1\n\nτ=1: y=1, U to y=2 at τ=2\n\n...\n\nUp to τ=6: y=6 at τ=6\n\nNow at τ=6, y=6, we can go U to y=7 at τ=7.\n\nτ=7: y=7, safe as above.\n\nBut now, from here, if we go U to y=8 at τ=8, unsafe.\n\nIf we stay, at τ=8 y=7 unsafe.\n\nIf we go D to y=6 at τ=8, safe.\n\nBut we are back to y=6.\n\nThen we need to go up later when safe.\n\nRow 8 safe after τ=9, i.e., τ>=10.\n\nSimilarly, row 7 safe after τ=9, τ>=10.\n\nBut τ=10 is safe for both.\n\nSince row 2-6 are safe, we can wait on them.\n\nFor example, at τ=6, y=6, instead of going up, we can stay for some turns.\n\nWe need to avoid being on row 7 or 8 during τ=8 and 9.\n\nSo, we can be on row 7 only at τ=2,3,4,5,6,7 or τ>=10.\n\nBut τ=7 is safe for row 7, but if we are at row 7 at τ=7, we cannot stay or go up without problem at τ=8.\n\nSimilarly, we can be on row 8 at τ=2,3,4,5,6,7 or τ>=10.\n\nτ=7 is safe for row 8? Row 8 unsafe at τ=0,1,8,9, so τ=7 is safe for row 8.\n\nBut to be on row 8 at τ=7, we need to arrive at τ=7.\n\nFor example, from y=7 at τ=6, go U to y=8 at τ=7.\n\nThen at τ=7, y=8, which is safe since τ=7 not unsafe.\n\nThen from here, at τ=7, we can go U to y=9 at τ=8.\n\nBut at τ=8, y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision, and we are at goal.\n\ny=9 at τ=8.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- At τ=6: y=6, action U, to y=7 at τ=7\n\n- But at τ=7, we are on y=7? Let's sequence.\n\nStart:\n\nτ=0: y=0, action U, to y=1 at τ=1\n\nτ=1: y=1, action U, to y=2 at τ=2\n\nτ=2: y=2, action U, to y=3 at τ=3\n\nτ=3: y=3, action U, to y=4 at τ=4\n\nτ=4: y=4, action U, to y=5 at τ=5\n\nτ=5: y=5, action U, to y=6 at τ=6\n\nNow at τ=6: y=6, action U, to y=7 at τ=7\n\nAt τ=7: position y=7. Now, row 7 at τ=7: unsafe? τ=7 not in {0,1,8,9}, so safe.\n\nThen at τ=7, we take action, say U, to go to y=8 at τ=8.\n\nBut at τ=8, we are at y=8, which is row 8, and τ=8 unsafe.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt τ=7, y=7, instead of going U, we go directly to y=8? No, we can only change by 1.\n\nAction U: to y=8 at τ=8.\n\nBut then at turn τ=8, we are on y=8, collision.\n\nIf at τ=7, we do S, then y=7 at τ=8, but row 7 at τ=8 unsafe.\n\nIf we do D, to y=6 at τ=8, safe but down.\n\nTo avoid, we need to not be on row 7 or 8 at τ=8 and τ=9.\n\nSo at τ=7, we should not be on row 7 if we are going to stay or something.\n\nFrom τ=6, y=6, we can stay there for some time.\n\nFor example, at τ=6, y=6, do S, then y=6 at τ=7.\n\nAt τ=7, y=6, row 6 safe.\n\nThen at τ=7, we can do U to y=7 at τ=8.\n\nBut at τ=8, y=7, row 7, and τ=8 unsafe for row 7.\n\nCollision.\n\nAt τ=7, y=6, do S, to y=6 at τ=8.\n\nAt τ=8, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at τ=8, we can do U to y=7 at τ=9.\n\nBut at τ=9, y=7, row 7, and τ=9 unsafe for row 7.\n\nStill problem.\n\nAt τ=8, y=6, do U to y=7 at τ=9, unsafe.\n\nIf we stay longer.\n\nRow 7 safe at τ=10 and later.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 safe at τ=10 and later.\n\nSo we can wait on row 6 until τ=9 or something.\n\nAt τ=6, y=6, we do S for multiple turns.\n\nFor example, stay at y=6 from τ=6 to τ=9.\n\nAt τ=6: y=6, action S, to y=6 at τ=7\n\nτ=7: y=6, action S, to y=6 at τ=8\n\nτ=8: y=6, action S, to y=6 at τ=9\n\nNow at τ=9, y=6, action U to y=7 at τ=10\n\nAt τ=10, y=7, row 7 at τ=10: safe, since τ=10 not unsafe.\n\nThen at τ=10, action U to y=8 at τ=11\n\nAt τ=11, y=8, row 8 at τ=11: safe, τ=11 not in unsafe times.\n\nThen at τ=11, action U to y=9 at τ=12\n\nSo we reach y=9 at τ=12.\n\nNumber of actions: from τ=0 to τ=11, 12 actions? Let's list:\n\nActions at τ=0 to τ=11 for y to change.\n\nAt τ=0: action, to y=1 at τ=1\n\n...\n\nUp to τ=5: action at τ=5 to y=6 at τ=6\n\nThen actions:\n\nτ=6: S, to y=6 at τ=7\n\nτ=7: S, to y=6 at τ=8\n\nτ=8: S, to y=6 at τ=9\n\nτ=9: U, to y=7 at τ=10\n\nτ=10: U, to y=8 at τ=11\n\nτ=11: U, to y=9 at τ=12\n\nSo at τ=12, y=9.\n\nWe reached at τ=12 with 12 actions? τ from 0 to 11, 12 actions, H=12.\n\nBut τ_final=12, so H-1=12, H=13? I'm confusing.\n\nDefine: relative turn after actions.\n\nStart: before any action, τ=0, y=0.\n\nAfter first action at τ=0, y at τ=1.\n\nAfter k actions, y at τ=k.\n\nWe want y at τ=M =9 for some M.\n\nThen number of actions is M.\n\nIn this case, y=9 at τ=12, so M=12 actions.\n\nSequence: actions at τ=0 to τ=11.\n\nIn terms of turn: at turn t1 + τ for τ=0 to 11.\n\nAnd y at turn t1 + 12 =9, but we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nt1 + H -1 = t1 + τ_final where y=9.\n\nτ_final = M, so t1 + M, so H-1 = M, thus H = M+1.\n\nIn this case, M=12, H=13.\n\nBut let's confirm with the straight attempt.\n\nIn straight: after actions at τ=0 to 8, y at τ=9.\n\nM=9 actions, H=10? Earlier I had issue at τ=8.\n\nBut in that case, with collision, not possible.\n\nWithout collision, if possible, M=9.\n\nBut with waiting, M=12.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nSince row 7 and 8 are safe at τ=7.\n\nFor row 7, safe at τ=7, as we said.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 safe at τ=7.\n\nBut if we are at row 7 at τ=7, we can go to row 8 at τ=8, but row 8 unsafe at τ=8.\n\nUnless we can go directly to row 8 earlier or later.\n\nBut we can only move one step.\n\nAnother idea: go to row 8 at τ=7, which is safe.\n\nThen from there, at τ=7, we can go directly to y=9 at τ=8 by U.\n\nAt τ=8, we are at y=9, which is safe, no freeway.\n\nBut when we go from y=8 to y=9, at turn τ=7, we are on y=8, take action U, so at turn τ=7, position y=8, then after action, y=9 at τ=8.\n\nAt turn τ=7, we are on row 8, which is safe if τ=7.\n\nThen no collision.\n\nThen at τ=8, we are at y=9, goal.\n\nIs that possible?\n\nSequence:\n\nWe need to be at y=8 at τ=7.\n\nHow to get there?\n\nFrom start:\n\nτ=0: y=0, action U to y=1 at τ=1\n\nτ=1: y=1, U to y=2 at τ=2\n\nτ=2: y=2, U to y=3 at τ=3\n\nτ=3: y=3, U to y=4 at τ=4\n\nτ=4: y=4, U to y=5 at τ=5\n\nτ=5: y=5, U to y=6 at τ=6\n\nτ=6: y=6, U to y=7 at τ=7? No.\n\nAt τ=6: y=6, action U to y=7 at τ=7.\n\nThen at τ=7: y=7, but we want to be at y=8 at τ=7.\n\nTo be at y=8 at τ=7, we need to have arrived from y=7 at τ=6.\n\nAt τ=6, position y_τ=6.\n\nAfter action at τ=6, to y=7 at τ=7 if U.\n\nBut we need y=8 at τ=7, so we must have been at y=7 at τ=6 and taken U to y=8 at τ=7.\n\nSo at τ=6, we need to be at y=7.\n\nBut from above, at τ=6, we are at y=6 if we went straight.\n\nWe need to be faster.\n\nCan we be at y=7 earlier?\n\nEarliest: start at τ=0, y=0, U to y=1 τ=1\n\nU at τ=1 to y=2 τ=2\n\nU τ=2 to y=3 τ=3\n\nU τ=3 to y=4 τ=4\n\nU τ=4 to y=5 τ=5\n\nU τ=5 to y=6 τ=6\n\nNow at τ=6, y=6, to go to y=7 at τ=7, we do U at τ=6 to y=7 at τ=7.\n\nBut we want to be at y=8 at τ=7, which requires that at τ=6 we are at y=7 and do U.\n\nBut at τ=6, we are at y=6, not y=7.\n\nImpossible to be at y=8 at τ=7 with only up moves starting from y=0 at τ=0.\n\nThe position at τ=7 is y=7 if we go all up, as above.\n\nWe cannot be at y=8 at τ=7.\n\nThe earliest we can be at y=8 is τ=8, as in the first straight path.\n\nBut at τ=8, row 8 is unsafe.\n\nSo we must avoid that.\n\nTherefore, we need to wait or go slower earlier.\n\nNow, back to row 1, we have unsafe at τ=16-19, but since we are going fast, we might not be affected if we pass row 1 early.\n\nIn the\n</think>\n",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 1) at turn t_1 = 80. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0 each turn, staying within y=0 to y=9.\n\nCollision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where there's a car such that 0 is in the car's span at that turn. Importantly, when moving to a new row, you're not on that row until the next turn, so you only check for collision on the row you're currently on at that turn.\n\nThe car states are given for each freeway at turn t_1=80. I need to find the positions at future turns based on their movement.\n\nLet me list out the car positions at turn 80 for reference:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, head -42, tail -53, direction right, speed 3. Since it's right-moving, span is [τ, h] = [-53, -42]? No, the notation says for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h], but in the table, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For freeway 1, it's (-42, -53, right, 3). Head and tail: head is the front, I think. For right-moving, head is larger, tail is smaller? Let's see the span definition.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → moves left, so h and τ decrease.\n\n- Right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → moves right, so τ and h increase.\n\nBut in the input, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). I need to interpret what head and tail mean.\n\nFor freeway 1: (-42, -53, right, 3). Since direction is right, and it's moving right, so the head should be the leading part. For right-moving, head is at higher x, tail at lower x. So here head = -42, tail = -53, so since -42 > -53, head is at x=-42, tail at x=-53, so the span is from x= -53 to x= -42. But according to the right-moving definition, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-53, -42], which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h, τ] with h and τ such that h > τ or something, but in this case, all cars here are right-moving, I think. Let me check.\n\nFreeway 1: (-42, -53, right, 3) → span [ -53, -42 ] at t=80.\n\nFreeway 2: (-48, -59, right, 12) → span [ -59, -48 ]\n\nSimilarly for 3,4,5.\n\nFreeway 6: two cars: (-48, -59, right, 12) and (24, 13, right, 12). For the second one, (24, 13, right, 12), head=24, tail=13, so span [13,24] since right-moving.\n\nFreeway 7: (-36, -47, right, 6) and (12, 1, right, 6) → first span [-47,-36], second [1,12]\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7? (-36, -47, right, 6) and (12, 1, right, 6) → spans [-47,-36] and [1,12]\n\nNow, the player starts at y=1, which is freeway 1. At turn t=80, position (0,1), so we need to check if there is a collision at turn 80 on freeway 1.\n\nFor freeway 1, car span [ -53, -42 ] at t=80. Is 0 in [ -53, -42 ]? -53 to -42, 0 is not between them since both negative, so no collision at start.\n\nThe collision is checked at each turn when the player is on that freeway.\n\nThe player is at y=1 at turn 80, so we check freeway 1 at t=80: 0 not in [-53,-42], so safe.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9. Since we start at y=1, and need to go up to y=9, that's 8 steps up, but we might need to stay or move down to avoid cars, so it could take more turns.\n\nThe minimal H might be 8 if we can go straight up, but we need to check for collisions on each freeway as we pass through.\n\nSince we move one row per turn when going up, but we can stay or move down, so we might spend multiple turns on a row.\n\nThe player position changes only when we move U or D, but when we stay, y doesn't change.\n\nTo minimize turns, we probably want to go up as much as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nNow, for each freeway, we need to know when the car spans cover x=0 at various turns.\n\nThe car positions change linearly with time.\n\nLet t be the turn number, with t=80 being the current turn.\n\nFor a car on a freeway, at turn T, the span is:\n\nFor right-moving car: initial span at t_1=80 is [τ, h], then at T, span is [τ + s*(T-80), h + s*(T-80)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all here are right-moving.\n\nIn this case, all cars are right-moving, from the data.\n\nFreeway 1: right, etc.\n\nSo general: for a car with initial head h, tail τ, direction right, speed s, at turn T, span [τ + s*(T-80), h + s*(T-80)]\n\nThen collision on that freeway at turn T if player is on that row at turn T and 0 is in the span, i.e., min(span) <= 0 <= max(span).\n\nSince span is [low, high] with low <= high.\n\nIn right-moving, at T, low = τ + s*(T-80), high = h + s*(T-80)\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but no left here.\n\nNow, for each freeway, we can find the times when 0 is covered by a car on that row.\n\nBut since multiple cars per row, we need for each row, the set of times when any car covers x=0.\n\nThen, when the player is on that row at time T, if at that T, there is a car covering x=0, collision.\n\nPlayer is on row y at turn T if y_T = y.\n\nAnd y changes based on actions.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of actions that gets to y=9 quickly without being on a row when a car is at x=0.\n\nNow, let's analyze each freeway's dangerous times.\n\nFirst, freeway y=1:\n\nCars: one car, initial τ=-53, h=-42, s=3, right.\n\nAt turn T, low = -53 + 3*(T-80)\n\nHigh = -42 + 3*(T-80)\n\n0 in span if low <= 0 <= high\n\nSo -53 + 3(T-80) <= 0 <= -42 + 3(T-80)\n\nSolve inequalities.\n\nFirst inequality: -53 + 3(T-80) <= 0 => 3(T-80) <= 53 => T-80 <= 53/3 ≈ 17.666, so T <= 80 + 17 = 97? Let's keep fractional.\n\nT-80 <= 53/3 = 17 + 2/3, so T <= 97 + 2/3? 80 + 17.666 = 97.666, so T <= 97 since T integer? T is turn, integer.\n\nTurns are discrete, so T integer.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 <= -42 + 3(T-80) => 42 <= 3(T-80) => 14 <= T-80 => T >= 94\n\nAnd from first: -53 + 3(T-80) <= 0 => 3(T-80) <= 53 => T-80 <= 17.666, so T <= 97 since T integer, T-80 <= 17.666, so max T-80=17, T=97.\n\nT-80 <= floor(53/3) but 53/3=17.666, so T-80 <= 17, T<=97.\n\nT-80 <= 17, T<=97.\n\nAnd T >= 94 from above.\n\nSo for freeway 1, car covers x=0 when T from 94 to 97 inclusive.\n\nT >=94 and T<=97.\n\nT-80 >=14 and T-80 <=17.\n\nT-80 min 14, max 17, so T=94,95,96,97.\n\nNow, at these turns, if player is on y=1, collision.\n\nOther times, safe on y=1.\n\nNow freeway 2: one car, (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nInitial τ=-59, h=-48, s=12\n\nAt T, low = -59 +12(T-80)\n\nHigh = -48 +12(T-80)\n\n0 in span if -59 +12(T-80) <= 0 <= -48 +12(T-80)\n\nFirst: -59 +12(T-80) <=0 => 12(T-80) <=59 => T-80 <= 59/12 ≈ 4.916, so T<=80 + 4.916, T<=84.916, so T<=84\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 +12(T-80) => 48 <=12(T-80) => 4 <= T-80 => T>=84\n\nT>=84 and T<=84? T-80 >=4 and T-80 <=59/12≈4.916, so T-80=4 since integer? T-80 >=4 and T-80 <=4.916, so T-80=4, T=84 only.\n\nBecause T-80 min 4, max 4.916, so only T=84.\n\nT-80=4, T=84.\n\nNow, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? (-48,-59,right,12), identical to freeway 2, so same, dangerous at T=84 only.\n\nSimilarly freeway 4: same, T=84.\n\nFreeway 5: same, T=84.\n\nNow freeway 6: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,12) same as above, dangerous at T=84.\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,12) head=24, tail=13, so initial τ=13, h=24, s=12\n\nAt T, low = 13 +12(T-80)\n\nHigh = 24 +12(T-80)\n\n0 in span? low <=0 <=high\n\n13 +12(T-80) <=0? 13 + something, since T-80 >=0, 13+12(delta) >=13>0, so low >=13>0, so 0 < low <= high, so 0 not <= high? 0 <= high: high =24+12(delta) >=24>0, but low >=13>0, so min span >0, so 0 not in span. Since both ends positive, 0 not covered.\n\nSo second car never covers x=0, only first car dangerous at T=84.\n\nSo for freeway 6, dangerous only at T=84.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-36,-47,right,6) τ=-47, h=-36, s=6\n\nAt T, low = -47 +6(T-80)\n\nHigh = -36 +6(T-80)\n\n0 in span: -47 +6(T-80) <=0 <= -36 +6(T-80)\n\nFirst: -47 +6(T-80) <=0 => 6(T-80) <=47 => T-80 <=47/6 ≈7.833, T<=87.833, T<=87\n\nSecond: 0 <= -36 +6(T-80) => 36 <=6(T-80) => 6 <= T-80 => T>=86\n\nT>=86 and T<=87? T-80 >=6 and T-80 <=7.833, so T-80=6 or 7, T=86 or 87.\n\nSecond car on freeway 7: (12,1,right,6) τ=1, h=12, s=6\n\nAt T, low=1 +6(T-80)\n\nHigh=12 +6(T-80)\n\n0 in span? low=1+6(delta) >=1>0, so min>0, 0 not covered.\n\nSo only first car dangerous at T=86 and 87.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same as freeway 7, cars (-36,-47,right,6) and (12,1,right,6), so same, dangerous at T=86 and 87.\n\nNow, summarize dangerous times for each row:\n\ny=1: dangerous at T=94,95,96,97\n\ny=2: dangerous at T=84 (only, from freeway 2)\n\ny=3: same as y=2, T=84\n\ny=4: same, T=84\n\ny=5: same, T=84\n\ny=6: dangerous at T=84 (from first car)\n\ny=7: dangerous at T=86,87\n\ny=8: dangerous at T=86,87\n\ny=9: no cars, always safe? The freeways are y=1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 are safe, I think. y=0 is the bottom, but player starts at y=1, and goal is y=9, so y=9 has no freeway, no cars, so always safe. Similarly, y=0 might have no cars or not specified, but we don't go there.\n\nThe vertical axis y=0 to 9, freeways on y=1 to 8 for cars. y=0 and y=9 are safe rows.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,1) at t=80.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal steps to go up: from y=1 to y=9, need to increase y by 8, so if no cars, H=8, actions U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U from t=80 to t=87, position at t=88 would be (0,9) if start at t=80 y=1.\n\nLet's see the sequence.\n\nAt turn t, action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nPlayer position: at turn t, position is (0, y_t)\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nSo to reach y=9, we need y_{t_1 + H} =9? Let's see the definition.\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\"\n\nFrom the task: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nt_1 + H -1 is the turn when position is (0,9).\n\nActions from t=0 to H-1 relative to t_1.\n\nSet τ = t - t_1, so τ=0 at current turn.\n\nAt τ=0, position y_0 =1? Better to use absolute turns.\n\nCurrent turn t=80, position (0,1)\n\nActions a_t for t from 80 to ? \n\nThe sequence is a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nAfter applying these actions, at turn t_1 + H -1, position should be (0,9)\n\nFor example, if H=1, actions for t=80 only, but at t=80, we are at y=1, after action, at t=81, y_{81} = y_{80} + Δy_{80}\n\nThen at turn t=81, position y_{81}, which may not be 9.\n\nThe turn when position is (0,9) is t_1 + H -1.\n\nSo for that to be turn T, with y_T =9.\n\nT = t_1 + H -1.\n\nNow, minimal H, so minimal T, since t_1 fixed.\n\nT min when H min.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9 safely.\n\nNow, with cars, we need to avoid being on a row when it is dangerous.\n\nPlayer path: start at y=1 at t=80.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nEach move U increases y by 1, D decreases, S stays.\n\nTo minimize time, we should go up as much as possible, but may need to wait or move down to avoid dangerous times.\n\nSince all dangerous times are early or late, we might be able to go straight up but avoid the dangerous turns on each row.\n\nList the dangerous periods:\n\nRow y=1: dangerous at t=94,95,96,97\n\nBut we start at t=80, which is before, so we can leave early.\n\ny=2: dangerous only at t=84\n\ny=3: t=84\n\ny=4: t=84\n\ny=5: t=84\n\ny=6: t=84\n\ny=7: dangerous at t=86,87\n\ny=8: dangerous at t=86,87\n\ny=9: always safe\n\nWe need to be on each row at times when it is safe.\n\nThe player must pass through each row from 1 to 8 to reach 9, but can stay or move down, so may visit rows multiple times or skip? Cannot skip, since y changes by at most 1, so must visit each integer y between start and end.\n\nStart at y=1, end at y=9, so must be on y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 at some points.\n\nFor each row, when the player is on it, it must not be a dangerous time for that row.\n\nMoreover, to minimize time, we want to spend as few turns as possible, so ideally move up every turn, but may need to stay or move down to avoid.\n\nFirst, let's see if we can go directly up without waiting.\n\nSuppose we start at t=80, y=1.\n\nAction at t=80: if U, then at t=81, y=2\n\nIf S, stay at y=1 for another turn.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, dangerous on y=1 only at t=94-97, which is late, so at t=80, we can leave immediately.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 dangerous only at t=84.\n\nSo if we go to y=2 at t=81, that is safe, since t=81 <84.\n\nThen from y=2, if we go to y=3 at t=82, also safe for y=3? y=3 dangerous at t=84, t=82<84, safe.\n\nSimilarly, to y=4 at t=83, safe.\n\nTo y=5 at t=84.\n\nAt t=84, if we are on y=5, is it dangerous? y=5 dangerous at t=84, yes, so if on y=5 at t=84, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if on y=4 at t=84, dangerous? y=4 also dangerous at t=84.\n\ny=2,3,4,5,6 all dangerous at t=84.\n\ny=2 to 6 all have danger at t=84.\n\ny=6 also dangerous at t=84.\n\nNow, if we go straight up:\n\nt=80: at y=1, safe\n\na_t= U, then t=81: y=2, safe (t=81<84)\n\na_t= U, t=82: y=3, safe\n\na_t= U, t=83: y=4, safe? t=83<84, so safe, since danger only at t=84 for y=4.\n\ny=4 dangerous only at t=84, so at t=83, safe.\n\nThen a_t= U at t=83, to y=5 at t=84.\n\nBut at t=84, on y=5, which is dangerous, collision.\n\nIf we stay at t=83 on y=4.\n\nAt t=83: if we are on y=4, and we do S, then at t=84, still on y=4, which is dangerous.\n\nIf we do D, to y=3 at t=84, but y=3 also dangerous at t=84.\n\nSimilarly, all rows y=2 to6 dangerous at t=84.\n\nSo if we are on any of y=2 to6 at t=84, collision.\n\nNow, y=1 is safe at t=84? y=1 dangerous only from t=94-97, so at t=84, y=1 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=7: dangerous at t=86,87, so at t=84, y=7 safe.\n\ny=8 safe at t=84.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nBut we are moving up, so at t=83, we are on y=4 if we went straight.\n\nOptions at t=83 on y=4:\n\n- If U, to y=5 at t=84, collision on y=5.\n\n- If S, stay y=4 at t=84, collision.\n\n- If D, to y=3 at t=84, collision on y=3.\n\nAll lead to collision at t=84 if we are on y=2,3,4,5,6 at t=84.\n\nBut we can avoid being on those rows at t=84.\n\nFor example, we could be on y=1 or y=7 or higher at t=84.\n\nBut we are at y=4 at t=83, so we need to not be on y=2-6 at t=84.\n\nSo we could go down to y=1? But y=1 is row below.\n\nAt t=83, y=4, if we do D, to y=3 at t=84, but y=3 dangerous.\n\nIf we do multiple downs, but time is short.\n\nAt t=82, we could have stayed or something.\n\nLet's think from start.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 quickly, but avoid t=84 on rows 2-6.\n\nSimilarly, later avoid t=86,87 on rows 7 and 8.\n\nFirst, let's handle the t=84 issue.\n\nThe only safe rows at t=84 are y=1 and y=7,8,9.\n\ny=1 is safe, y=7 is safe (since danger at 86-87), y=8 safe, y=9 safe.\n\nBut y=7 and above might be reachable by t=84?\n\nAt t=80, y=1\n\nt=81, y=2 if U\n\nt=82, y=3 if U\n\nt=83, y=4 if U\n\nt=84, we need to be on y=7 or something, but we can only move one step per turn, so at t=84, from y=4, we can be at y=3,4,5, not y=7.\n\nImpossible to be on y=7 at t=84 from start.\n\nSimilarly, to be on y=1 at t=84, we need to have moved down.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt t=80: y=1, safe\n\na=U, t=81: y=2\n\na=U, t=82: y=3\n\nNow at t=82, on y=3.\n\nInstead of going to y=4, we could do S or D.\n\nIf at t=82, a=S, then at t=83, still y=3.\n\nThen at t=83, if a=S, t=84 y=3, collision.\n\nIf a=D, t=84 y=2, collision on y=2.\n\nIf a=U, t=84 y=4, collision.\n\nAll bad.\n\nAt t=81, on y=2.\n\nInstead of U to y=3, we could do S or D.\n\nIf a=S at t=81, then t=82 y=2.\n\nt=82 y=2, safe since t=82<84.\n\nThen at t=82, we can do something.\n\nIf a=D at t=81, to y=1 at t=82.\n\nThen at t=82, y=1, safe.\n\nNow at t=82, y=1, we can stay or move.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nTo avoid being on y=2-6 at t=84, we must be on y=1 or y=7+ at t=84.\n\ny=7+ not possible, so must be on y=1 at t=84.\n\nTherefore, at turn t=84, we must be on row y=1 to be safe.\n\nThen, at that time, we can start moving up after t=84.\n\nNow, after t=84, the dangerous times are for y=7 and y=8 at t=86,87.\n\nBut let's first get to t=84 on y=1.\n\nWe start at t=80, y=1.\n\nTo be at y=1 at t=84, we need to stay on y=1 for some turns.\n\nCurrently at t=80, y=1.\n\nIf we stay at y=1 until t=84, that means from t=80 to t=83, we do S, so at t=81, y=1; t=82, y=1; t=83, y=1; t=84, y=1.\n\nAll safe since y=1 not dangerous except late times.\n\nThen at t=84, y=1, safe.\n\nNow, after that, we can start moving up.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nAlso, later we have to deal with y=7 and y=8 dangerous at t=86,87.\n\nFirst, from t=84, y=1.\n\nWe can go up.\n\nt=84: y=1\n\na=U, t=85: y=2\n\na=U, t=86: y=3\n\nBut at t=86, we are on y=3? y=3 has no danger except at t=84, which is past, so safe.\n\ny=2 to 6 are only dangerous at t=84, so after t=84, they are safe.\n\nSimilarly before t=84, they are safe except at t=84.\n\nFor example, y=2: dangerous only at t=84, so at t=85, safe, etc.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo after t=84, all rows y=2 to6 are safe.\n\nNow, y=7 and y=8 dangerous at t=86 and t=87.\n\nSo we need to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at t=86 or t=87.\n\nNow, from above: at t=85, we can be at y=2 if we go up from y=1 at t=84.\n\nt=84: y=1\n\na=U, t=85: y=2\n\na=U, t=86: y=3\n\nAt t=86, y=3, safe, since y=3 danger only at t=84.\n\nThen a=U, t=87: y=4\n\na=U, t=88: y=5\n\na=U, t=89: y=6\n\na=U, t=90: y=7\n\nBut at t=90, y=7, which is safe? y=7 dangerous at t=86 and 87, t=90>87, so safe? Let's see the times.\n\ny=7 dangerous at t=86 and 87 only.\n\nt=90 >87, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, a=U, t=91: y=8\n\ny=8 dangerous at t=86,87, t=91>87, safe.\n\na=U, t=92: y=9\n\nThen at t=92, y=9, which is the goal.\n\nBut we need to check if we can reach earlier.\n\nIn this path, we stayed at y=1 from t=80 to t=83, so actions S,S,S,S at t=80,81,82,83? Let's list the turns.\n\nt=80: position y=1, we do action a_80.\n\nAfter a_80, at t=81, y depends.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAt t=80: we are at y=1, we need to decide action.\n\nTo be at y=1 at t=84, we can:\n\nFrom t=80 to t=83: do S each time, so at t=81, y=1; t=82, y=1; t=83, y=1; t=84, y=1.\n\nActions: a_80 = S, a_81 = S, a_82 = S, a_83 = S? a_{t} for t from 80 to ?\n\nAt t=80, action a_80, then position at t=81 is y_81 = y_80 + Δy_80\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo to stay at y=1 from t=80 to t=84, we need to do S at t=80, t=81, t=82, t=83.\n\nThen at t=84, y=1.\n\nThen we can start moving up.\n\na_84 = U, so at t=85, y=2\n\na_85 = U, at t=86, y=3\n\na_86 = U, at t=87, y=4\n\na_87 = U, at t=88, y=5\n\na_88 = U, at t=89, y=6\n\na_89 = U, at t=90, y=7\n\na_90 = U, at t=91, y=8\n\na_91 = U, at t=92, y=9\n\nNow at t=92, y=9, which is the goal turn.\n\nH is the number of actions? Actions from t=80 to t=91? That's 12 actions? t from 80 to 91 inclusive is 12 turns? Let's see.\n\nThe actions: a_80 to a_91, that's 12 actions.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = t=92, since y_{92}=9.\n\nt_1 =80, so 80 + H -1 =92, so 79 + H =92, H=13? Let's calculate.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =92\n\n80 + H -1 =92\n\n79 + H =92\n\nH=13\n\nNumber of actions: from t=80 to t=80 + (H-1) =80 +12=92? t_1 + H -1 =80 + H -1\n\nSet equal to 92, so 80 + H -1 =92, H-1=12, H=13.\n\nActions: a_{80} to a_{92}? Indices.\n\nSequence {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo a_{t_1 + 0} = a_80\n\na_{t_1 +1} = a_81\n\n...\n\na_{t_1 + (H-1)} = a_{80 + H -1}\n\nAnd at turn t_1 + H -1, position is (0,9)\n\nIn this case, t_1 + H -1 =92, so a_{80} to a_{91}, since a_{91} is applied at turn 91 to go to y_{92}.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nAt turn T, position is (0, y_T)\n\nThen we apply action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}\n\nAfter applying a_T, we have y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T\n\nThen at turn T+1, position is (0, y_{T+1})\n\nThe sequence ends when at some turn, position is (0,9)\n\nSpecifically, after actions up to a_{t_1 + H -1}, at turn t_1 + H -1, y =9.\n\nIn the sequence, we have H actions: a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, applied at turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1, resulting in positions from t_1+1 to t_1 + H.\n\nAt turn t_1, position before any action is given.\n\nThen we apply a_{t_1}, so at turn t_1 +1, position y_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}\n\nSimilarly, after a_{t_1 + k}, at turn t_1 + k +1, position y_{t_1 + k +1}\n\nAfter last action a_{t_1 + H -1}, at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}\n\nBut we want at turn t_1 + H -1, position to be (0,9)\n\nInconsistency.\n\nFrom task: \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nAnd actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}\n\nAt turn t_1 + t for t=0, position is initial, (0,y_{t_1})\n\nThen apply a_{t_1 + t}, get to next position.\n\nAfter applying a_{t_1 + t}, we are at turn t_1 + t +1.\n\nSo after all actions, at turn t_1 + H, we are at some position.\n\nBut we want at turn t_1 + H -1 to be position (0,9)\n\nSo turn t_1 + H -1 must be the time when we are at (0,9), before any action at that turn.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think that at turn T, we decide action a_T based on current position.\n\nThen at turn T, position is (0,y_T), we choose a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T, so at turn T+1, position (0,y_{T+1})\n\nThe goal is to have at some turn T, y_T =9.\n\nAnd T = t_1 + H -1 for minimal H.\n\nIn the action sequence, we have actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, and after these, at turn (t_1 + H -1) +1 = t_1 + H, position is set, but we want position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nSo at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at (0,9), and we may or may not have an action, but the sequence includes actions up to the one that brings us to 9 at that turn.\n\nExample: suppose we start at t_1, y=1.\n\nIf we do nothing, at t_1, y=1.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nSuppose we do U at t_1, then at t_1 +1, y=2.\n\nIf we want at t_1 to be y=9, impossible if start lower.\n\nSo turn t_1 + H -1 is when we arrive at y=9.\n\nFor instance, if we go directly up from y=1 to y=9 in 8 steps: actions U at t=80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87\n\nThen at t=88, y=9.\n\nSo T=88, t_1 + H -1 =80 + H -1 =88, so 79 + H =88, H=9.\n\nActions from a80 to a87, 8 actions? t from 0 to H-1, so a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, number of actions is H.\n\nt1 + H -1 =88, t1=80, so 80 + H -1 =88, H-1=8, H=9.\n\nActions a80 to a88? a_{t1 + k} for k=0 to H-1.\n\nk=0: a80, applied at t80, to go to t81\n\n...\n\nk=H-1: a_{t1 + H-1}, applied at t_{t1 + H-1}, to go to t_{t1 + H}\n\nBut we want at turn t_{t1 + H -1} position to be 9.\n\nSo when we are at turn t_{t1 + H -1}, we are at position (0,9), and we have just arrived or something.\n\nIn the sequence, the action at t_{t1 + H -1} is the last action that sets y to 9 at that turn? No.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T, we apply a_T, get y_{T+1}.\n\nTo have y_T =9 for some T, we must have that at turn T, we are at 9, which could be by staying or arriving.\n\nBut in the action, to be at y_T=9, it could be that a_{T-1} was U or S from 9, or D but not from below.\n\nEasier to think that we need to reach position (0,9) at turn T with T = t1 + H -1.\n\nIn the path above with waiting, we had at t=92, y=9.\n\nt1=80, so T=92, 80 + H -1 =92, H-1=12, H=13.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nBack to the car avoidance.\n\nWe must be on y=1 at t=84 to avoid collision.\n\nThen from there, go up.\n\nBut at t=86 and t=87, we need to avoid y=7 and y=8.\n\nIn the path I had, we were on y=3 at t=86, which is fine.\n\ny=7 and y=8 are dangerous at t=86,87, so we need to not be on them at those turns.\n\nIn the up path from t=84:\n\nt=84: y=1\n\na=U, t=85: y=2\n\na=U, t=86: y=3\n\na=U, t=87: y=4\n\na=U, t=88: y=5\n\na=U, t=89: y=6\n\na=U, t=90: y=7\n\na=U, t=91: y=8\n\na=U, t=92: y=9\n\nAt t=86, y=3, safe\n\nt=87, y=4, safe\n\nt=90, y=7, but y=7 dangerous at t=86,87, t=90>87, so safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8 at t=91>87, safe.\n\nBut can we reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if we don't wait so long at y=1.\n\nWe need to be on y=1 at t=84, but we can move up before and come back, but that might take more time.\n\nFor example, at t=80, y=1, we can go up to y=2 or higher, but we need to be back at y=1 by t=84.\n\nBut going up and down will take extra turns, so it's worse than staying.\n\nFor instance, suppose at t=80, U to y=2 at t=81\n\nThen at t=81, y=2, we can go down to y=1 at t=82, etc., but to be at y=1 at t=84, we can do:\n\nt=80: U, t=81 y=2\n\nt=81: D, t=82 y=1\n\nt=82: S, t=83 y=1\n\nt=83: S, t=84 y=1\n\nBut this has extra moves, we used U and D, ended at same y, wasted two actions compared to staying.\n\nSo staying is better.\n\nThus, minimal is to stay at y=1 from t=80 to t=83, so at t=84 y=1.\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut in the up path, we go to y=9 at t=92.\n\nBut we have to avoid y=7 and y=8 at t=86 and t=87.\n\nIn the above, we are not on them at those times.\n\nBut perhaps we can go faster after t=84.\n\nFrom t=84 y=1, we go U each turn to y=9 at t=92.\n\nBut y=9 is reached at t=92.\n\nBut earlier, if no cars, we could reach at t=88.\n\nBut with cars, we have the y=7 and y=8 dangers at t=86,87.\n\nIn the above path, we are on lower rows at t=86,87, so no issue.\n\nBut can we reach y=9 before t=92?\n\nFor example, if we start moving up earlier, but we need to be at y=1 at t=84.\n\nSuppose we go up to some point and come down, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, go to y=3 at t=82, then need to be back to y=1 at t=84.\n\nt=82 y=3, then t=82: D to y=2 at t=83\n\nt=83: D to y=1 at t=84\n\nBut at t=83, from y=2 to y=1, at t=83 y=2, which is safe since t=83<84.\n\nThen t=84 y=1.\n\nBut we used actions: t=80: U to y=2? Start t=80 y=1.\n\nt=80: U, t=81 y=2\n\nt=81: U, t=82 y=3\n\nt=82: D, t=83 y=2\n\nt=83: D, t=84 y=1\n\nCompared to staying: t=80 S, t=81 y=1; t=81 S, t=82 y=1; t=82 S, t=83 y=1; t=83 S, t=84 y=1\n\nIn moving case, we have two U and two D, net zero, but used four actions to be at y=1 at t=84, same as staying with four S, but in staying, actions are S, which is fine.\n\nBut in terms of position, same, but in moving case, we have extra moves, no gain.\n\nThen from t=84 y=1, we go up as before.\n\nSo no benefit.\n\nThus, the waiting at start is necessary.\n\nNow, after t=84, we go up, but we need to handle y=7 and y=8 dangers at t=86,87.\n\nIn the path, at t=86 we are at y=3, t=87 at y=4, both safe.\n\nBut y=7 and y=8 are dangerous at t=86,87, so we need to not be on them then.\n\nBut since we are on lower rows, it's fine.\n\nHowever, when we reach y=7, at t=90, which is after t=87, so safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8 at t=91.\n\nBut can we reach y=9 earlier than t=92?\n\nFrom t=84 y=1, to y=9, we need 8 moves up, so from t=84 to t=92, 8 turns later? Let's see.\n\nAt t=84, position y=1\n\nAfter a_84 = U, t=85 y=2\n\na_85 U, t=86 y=3\n\na_86 U, t=87 y=4\n\na_87 U, t=88 y=5\n\na_88 U, t=89 y=6\n\na_89 U, t=90 y=7\n\na_90 U, t=91 y=8\n\na_91 U, t=92 y=9\n\nSo at t=92, y=9.\n\nWe need to reach at t= t1 + H -1 =92.\n\nWith H=13, as before.\n\nBut is there a way to be on y=9 earlier?\n\nFor example, if we can be on a higher row at t=84, but we must be on y=1.\n\nUnless we can avoid the danger without waiting, but earlier we saw it's impossible.\n\nAnother idea: we could go down to y=0, but y=0 might be safe, but we need to go up, and y=0 to y=9 takes more steps.\n\nFor example, at t=80 y=1, go D to y=0 at t=81, but y=0 no cars, safe, but then we need to come back, waste turns.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo staying at y=1 until t=84 is best.\n\nBut now, with y=7 and y=8, we have dangers at t=86,87, but in our path, we are not affected since we are below.\n\nBut we can optimize the later part.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 are dangerous only at t=86,87, we can pass them before or after.\n\nIn our case, we pass y=7 at t=90, y=8 at t=91, both after t=87, safe.\n\nBut if we can pass earlier, but we start from y=1 at t=84, we can't reach y=7 before t=86? Let's see.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=84, after one U, t=85 y=2; t=86 y=3; so at t=86, we are at y=3, not y=7.\n\nTo be at y=7 at t=86, we need to have been at y=6 at t=85, but at t=84 we are at y=1, impossible to be at y=6 in one step.\n\nSo we cannot be on y=7 or y=8 before t=86, since at t=85, max y=2 from start.\n\nt=84 y=1, t=85 y=2, t=86 y=3, so at t=86, y<=3, not 7 or 8.\n\nSimilarly, at t=87, we can be at y=4, still not 7 or 8.\n\nSo we are safe from that danger automatically in this path.\n\nThus, with H=13, we reach at t=92.\n\nBut let's confirm the dangerous times for y=7 and y=8.\n\ny=7 dangerous at t=86 and 87.\n\nIn our path, at t=86, we are on y=3, not y=7.\n\nAt t=87, on y=4, not y=7.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nWhen we are on y=7 at t=90, safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut can we reduce H?\n\nFor example, if we start moving up immediately but avoid the t=84 on critical rows.\n\nBut we must not be on y=2-6 at t=84.\n\nSuppose we go up to y=6 before t=84, but y=6 dangerous at t=84, so we need to not be on it at t=84.\n\nSimilarly, if we are on y=6 at t=83, then at t=83, we can go to y=7 at t=84.\n\nBut y=7 at t=84 is safe, since danger only at t=86,87.\n\nSimilarly, if we can reach y=6 by t=83.\n\nStart at t=80 y=1.\n\nt=80: U, t=81 y=2\n\nt=81: U, t=82 y=3\n\nt=82: U, t=83 y=4\n\nNow at t=83 y=4, if we do U, t=84 y=5, but y=5 dangerous at t=84, collision.\n\nIf we do nothing, S, t=84 y=4, collision.\n\nIf we do D, to y=3 at t=84, collision.\n\nCannot go to y=7 from y=4 in one step.\n\nSo impossible to be on y=7 at t=84 from start.\n\nSimilarly, the only way is to be on y=1 at t=84.\n\nThus, minimal H is 13.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach y=9 with fewer actions by moving faster after.\n\nNo, from y=1 at t=84, to y=9 at t=92, 8 moves, 8 actions, but the turn when we arrive is t=92.\n\nWith H=13 actions from t=80 to t=92? Actions from a80 to a91 for positions t81 to t92.\n\nAt t92 y=9.\n\nNow, the sequence: we need to output actions from t80 to t80 + H -1.\n\nWith H=13, actions from a80 to a92? t1 + H -1 =80 +12=92? Earlier: t1 + H -1 =92, t1=80, so 80 + H -1 =92, H-1=12, H=13.\n\nActions: a_{80} to a_{80+12} = a_{92}, but a_{92} is applied at t92 to go to t93, but we are at t92 y=9, so we don't need action at t92 if we are already at 9.\n\nI think I confused the indexing.\n\nLet me define.\n\nLet T be the turn.\n\nAt T=80, position y=1.\n\nWe apply action a80, then at T=81, y = y80 + Δa80\n\nSimilarly, apply a81, at T=82, y82 = y81 + Δa81\n\n...\n\nAfter applying a_{k}, at T=k+1, y_{k+1}\n\nWe want for some T, y_T =9.\n\nAnd T = t1 + H -1 =80 + H -1\n\nFor minimal T, or minimal H.\n\nIn the sequence, actions a80 to a_{T-1} to reach y at T.\n\nSince at T, we are at y_T, without action at T.\n\nThe action sequence is for turns t1 to t1+H-1, and at turn t1+H-1, position is 9.\n\nSo for turn t1+H-1, we are at 9, and we have applied actions from t1 to t1+H-2 to get there? Let's see.\n\nSuppose we start at T=80, y=1.\n\nTo be at y=9 at T=80, impossible.\n\nIf at T=81, y=9, need to go from y=1 to y=9 in one action, impossible.\n\nEarliest possible at T=88, with 8 up actions.\n\nBut with cars, we have delay.\n\nIn our case with waiting, at T=92.\n\nNow back to the sequence for H=13.\n\nt1 + H -1 =80 + H -1 =92, so H-1=12, H=13.\n\nActions from a80 to a91, applied at T=80 to 91, resulting in positions from T=81 to 92.\n\nAt T=92, y=9.\n\nThe actions are for T=80 to 91.\n\nIn the sequence, we have a80 to a91.\n\nFor the waiting: from T=80 to T=83, we do S, so y remains 1.\n\nThen from T=84 to T=91, we do U each time to go up to y=9 at T=92.\n\nT=84: a84=U, to y=2 at T=85\n\nT=85: a85=U, to y=3 at T=86\n\n...\n\nUp to T=91: a91=U, to y=9 at T=92\n\nNow, we need to confirm if at any point we have collision.\n\nFirst, at T=80: y=1, row y=1, car not at 0, safe.\n\nT=81: y=1, same, safe.\n\nT=82: y=1, safe.\n\nT=83: y=1, safe.\n\nT=84: y=1, row y=1, not dangerous at t=84 (danger at 94-97), so safe.\n\nT=85: y=2, row y=2, dangerous only at t=84, t=85>84, safe.\n\nT=86: y=3, row y=3, dangerous only at t=84, safe.\n\nT=87: y=4, row y=4, dangerous only at t=84, safe.\n\nT=88: y=5, row y=5, safe (only danger t=84)\n\nT=89: y=6, row y=6, safe\n\nT=90: y=7, row y=7, dangerous at t=86,87, t=90>87, safe.\n\nT=91: y=8, row y=8, dangerous at t=86,87, t=91>87, safe.\n\nT=92: y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nNow, is it possible with less than H=13?\n\nFor example, if we can reach y=9 earlier.\n\nSuppose we go up immediately but stay on safe rows.\n\nFor example, at T=80: U, to y=2 at T=81\n\nT=81: U, to y=3 at T=82\n\nT=82: U, to y=4 at T=83\n\nNow at T=83, y=4.\n\nWe need to not be on y=2-6 at T=84.\n\nOptions: if we go U to y=5 at T=84, collision.\n\nS to y=4, collision.\n\nD to y=3, collision.\n\nIf we could go to y=7, impossible.\n\nSo must leave the rows.\n\nBut we can go down to y=1, but at T=83, if we do D, to y=3 at T=84? From y=4, D to y=3 at T=84, but y=3 dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, to go to y=1 at T=84, need to do multiple down, but at T=83, from y=4, if D to y=3 at T=84, collision.\n\nIf at T=82, y=3, we could do D to y=2 at T=83, then at T=83 y=2, then D to y=1 at T=84.\n\nBut at T=84, y=1, safe.\n\nBut let's see the sequence:\n\nT=80: U, to y=2 at T=81\n\nT=81: U, to y=3 at T=82\n\nT=82: D, to y=2 at T=83? Action at T=82, from y=3, D, so y_{83} = y_{82} + (-1) = 3-1=2\n\nThen at T=83, y=2\n\nThen a_{83}: D, to y=1 at T=84\n\nThen at T=84, y=1, safe.\n\nNow, from here, same as before, go up to y=9.\n\nBut we used: actions T=80 U, T=81 U, T=82 D, T=83 D, T=84 U, etc.\n\nCompared to previous: in previous we had T=80 S, T=81 S, T=82 S, T=83 S, T=84 U, ...\n\nIn this, we have U,U,D,D instead of S,S,S,S.\n\nNet: from T=80 to T=84, we started y=1, ended y=1, but used two U and two D, which are unnecessary moves, whereas with S we just stay.\n\nSo we used more actions to achieve the same position at T=84.\n\nThen from T=84 y=1, same up path, we reach y=9 at T=92, but with more actions? In this sequence, actions from T=80 to T=91? Let's count.\n\nT=80: U to y=2 at T=81\n\nT=81: U to y=3 at T=82\n\nT=82: D to y=2 at T=83\n\nT=83: D to y=1 at T=84\n\nT=84: U to y=2 at T=85\n\nT=85: U to y=3 at T=86\n\nT=86: U to y=4 at T=87\n\nT=87: U to y=5 at T=88\n\nT=88: U to y=6 at T=89\n\nT=89: U to y=7 at T=90\n\nT=90: U to y=8 at T=91\n\nT=91: U to y=9 at T=92\n\nSo actions from T=80 to T=91, that's 12 actions? T=80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91: 12 actions.\n\nAt T=92, y=9.\n\nt1 + H -1 =92, t1=80, so 80 + H -1 =92, H-1=12, H=13? 80 + H -1 =92, H-1=12, H=13.\n\nNumber of actions: from a80 to a91, which is 12 actions? a80,a81,...,a91 is 12 terms.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, H terms.\n\na_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1}, inclusive, so number is H.\n\nFor example, if H=1, only a_{t1}, then at turn t1, after action? But we want position at t1 to be 9, but if we apply a_{t1}, we go to t1+1.\n\nInconsistency when starting not at 9.\n\nIn this case, with 12 actions, we have positions from T=81 to T=92, with y=9 at T=92.\n\nt1 + H -1 =92, with t1=80, so 80 + H -1 =92, H-1=12, H=13.\n\nBut with 12 actions, H should be 12? I think I have off-by-one.\n\nList the turns:\n\n- At T=80: position, before action, y=1\n\n- Apply a80: say U, then at T=81, y=2\n\n- Apply a81: U, at T=82 y=3\n\n- ...\n\n- Apply a91: U, at T=92 y=9\n\nSo actions applied: a80 to a91, that's 12 actions.\n\nThe last action is a91 applied at T=91 to go to T=92 y=9.\n\nThe turn when position is 9 is T=92.\n\nT = t1 + H -1\n\n92 = 80 + H -1\n\n92 = 79 + H\n\nH = 13\n\nBut number of actions is 12? Contradiction.\n\nt1 + H -1 =92\n\n80 + H -1 =92\n\n79 + H =92\n\nH=13\n\nNumber of actions: from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1} = a_{80} to a_{80+12} = a_{92}\n\na_{80} to a_{92}, that's 13 actions.\n\na_{80}, a_{81}, ..., a_{92}: 13 terms.\n\nIn the sequence above, we have a80 to a91 for 12 actions to reach T=92.\n\nMissing one.\n\nFor T=92 position, we need actions from a80 to a91.\n\na80 applied at T=80 to set T=81\n\n...\n\na91 applied at T=91 to set T=92\n\nSo actions a80 to a91, 12 actions, for H=12.\n\nThen t1 + H -1 =80 +12 -1=91, but we are at y=9 at T=92, not T=91.\n\nAt T=91, in the sequence, y=8 or something.\n\nIn the waiting path: at T=91, y=8 if we go up.\n\nTo have y=9 at T=91, we need to be at y=9 at T=91.\n\nFor example, if we reach earlier.\n\nIn general, to have position at turn K be 9, we need to have applied actions from t1 to K-1, so K = t1 + (K - t1)\n\nThen T = K = t1 + H -1, so H-1 = K - t1, number of actions is H = (K - t1) +1\n\nSince actions from t1 to K-1, that's (K-1) - t1 +1 = K - t1 actions? Indices.\n\nActions from index t1 to M, number of actions: M - t1 +1\n\nThen after, position at turn M+1.\n\nSet turn position 9 at turn T.\n\nThen actions from t1 to T-1, number of actions: (T-1) - t1 +1 = T - t1\n\nThen H = number of actions = T - t1\n\nThen T = t1 + H -1? t1 + H -1 = t1 + (T - t1) -1 +1? Messy.\n\nFrom definition: T = t1 + H -1\n\nAnd H is number of actions.\n\nIn the direct up case no cars: start t1=80 y=1, actions a80 to a87 U, then at T=88 y=9.\n\nT=88, t1 + H -1=88, 80 + H -1=88, H-1=8, H=9.\n\nActions a80 to a87, 8 actions? a80 to a87 is 8 actions (t=80 to 87).\n\n80 to 87 inclusive: 87-80+1=8 actions.\n\nThen at T=88 y=9.\n\nt1 + H -1 =80 + H -1 =88, so H-1=8, H=9.\n\nNumber of actions H=9.\n\nWith 8 actions, H=9.\n\nSimilarly, in our case with waiting, at T=92 y=9, t1 + H -1=92, 80 + H -1=92, H-1=12, H=13.\n\nActions from a80 to a91, which is 12 actions? a80 to a91: 91-80+1=12 actions.\n\nThen H=13, which matches t1 + H -1=80+13-1=92.\n\nYes.\n\nBack to the path.\n\nWith H=13, actions: for T=80 to T=90: let's list the actions to stay and go up.\n\nIn the first plan: from T=80 to T=83: S each, so a80=S, a81=S, a82=S, a83=S\n\nThen T=84: U, a84=U\n\nT=85: U, a85=U\n\nT=86: U, a86=U\n\nT=87: U, a87=U\n\nT=88: U, a88=U\n\nT=89: U, a89=U\n\nT=90: U, a90=U\n\nT=91: U, a91=U\n\nThen at T=92, y=9.\n\nNow, actions: a80 to a91, that's 12 actions? T=80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91: 12 actions.\n\nH=13, so we need up to a92? But a92 would be for T=92, to go to T=93, but we are already at y=9 at T=92, so we don't need action at T=92.\n\nThe sequence should end with the action that brings us to 9 at T=92, which is a91 applied at T=91.\n\nSo actions from a80 to a91.\n\nH=13, a80 to a91 is 12 terms? 91-80+1=12, but H=13, inconsistency.\n\nI think I found the mistake.\n\nThe action sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so t=0: a_{t1}, t=1: a_{t1+1}, ..., t=H-1: a_{t1 + H-1}\n\nNumber of actions: H.\n\nIn this case, for our path, we have actions at t=80 to t=91, which is t1 to t1+11, so H=12? t1 + (H-1) =91, t1=80, so 80 + H-1 =91, H-1=11, H=12.\n\nThen t1 + H -1 =80 +12 -1=91.\n\nAt turn 91, position should be 9.\n\nIn our sequence, at T=91, what is y?\n\nIn the path: after a90 applied at T=90, to y at T=91.\n\nIn the list: T=90: apply a90, to y at T=91.\n\nIf a90=U, and at T=90 position, let's track.\n\nAt T=80: y=1, apply a80=S, so y81=1\n\nT=81: y=1, apply a81=S, y82=1\n\nT=82: y=1, apply a82=S, y83=1\n\nT=83: y=1, apply a83=S, y84=1\n\nT=84: y=1, apply a84=U, y85=2\n\nT=85: y=2, apply a85=U, y86=3\n\nT=86: y=3, apply a86=U, y87=4\n\nT=87: y=4, apply a87=U, y88=5\n\nT=88: y=5, apply a88=U, y89=6\n\nT=89: y=6, apply a89=U, y90=7\n\nT=90: y=7, apply a90=U, y91=8\n\nT=91: y=8, apply a91=U, y92=9\n\nSo at T=91, y=8, not 9.\n\nWe need at T=91 to be y=9.\n\nWith H=12, t1 + H -1 =80+12-1=91, so position at T=91 should be 9.\n\nBut in this, at T=91, y=8.\n\nTo have y=9 at T=91, we need to reach earlier.\n\nFor example, if we start moving up sooner.\n\nBut we have to be at y=1 at T=84.\n\nAt T=84, y=1.\n\nThen to be at y=9 at T=91, we need to go from y=1 to y=9 in 7 steps? From T=84 to T=91, that's 7 turns: T=85 to T=91.\n\nAt T=84, position y=1.\n\nAfter actions, at T=85 y=?, ..., up to T=91 y=9.\n\nNumber of actions from T=84 to T=90 to set positions T=85 to T=91.\n\nTo have y91=9, with y84=1, need to increase by 8 in 7 steps? From T=85 to T=91, 7 positions, but y at T=85 to y91.\n\ny84=1, after a84, y85 = y84 + Δa84\n\nWe want y91=9.\n\nThe values from y85 to y91.\n\ny91 = y84 + sum of Δa from t=84 to 90\n\n7 actions: a84 to a90, determining y85 to y91.\n\ny91 = y84 + Δa84 + Δa85 + ... + Δa90\n\nΔa is +1, -1, or 0.\n\nTo go from y84=1 to y91=9, need net +8 in 7 steps.\n\nEach U is +1, D -1, S 0.\n\nSo sum of Δa from 84 to 90 must be +8.\n\nBut each |Δa| <=1, so maximum increase in 7 steps is +7, to y91=1+7=8, not 9.\n\nMinimum increase +7 if all U, y91=8.\n\nCannot reach y=9 at T=91 from y=1 at T=84 in 7 actions.\n\nWith 7 actions, we can reach up to y=8 at T=91.\n\nTo reach y=9 at T=91, we need to start from higher or earlier.\n\nBut at T=84, we are at y=1, so earliest to reach y=9 is T=92 with 8 up actions from T=84.\n\nThus, with the constraint, minimal T is 92, H=13.\n\nIn the sequence, actions a80 to a91 for 12 actions, H=13? a80 to a91 is 12 actions, but with H=13, we need a80 to a92.\n\nBut a92 would be applied at T=92 to go to T=93, but we are at T=92 y=9, so if we include a92, it could be S or something, but we don't need to move.\n\nIn the task, the sequence should bring us to (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, and we stop.\n\nSo in this case, for T=92, we need actions up to a91.\n\nWith H=13, actions from a80 to a92.\n\nBut a92 is not necessary.\n\nPerhaps for the last action, if we are at y=9 at T=92, we don't need a92.\n\nI think for the sequence, when we reach y=9 at turn K, then K = t1 + H -1, and actions from t1 to K-1.\n\nNumber of actions H = K - t1.\n\nThen K = t1 + (H) -1, yes.\n\nIn this case, K=92, t1=80, H= K - t1 =92-80=12.\n\nThen t1 + H -1 =80+12-1=91, not 92.\n\nInconsistency in the definition.\n\nI think I should look at the answer format.\n\nThe output is Turn t1: a_{t1}, Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}, etc.\n\nAnd it ends when reached.\n\nIn this case, for our path, we have actions:\n\nTurn 80: S\n\nTurn 81: S\n\nTurn 82: S\n\nTurn 83: S\n\nTurn 84: U\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: U\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nTurn 89: U\n\nTurn 90: U\n\nTurn 91: U\n\nThen at turn 92, position y=9.\n\nSo we have 12 actions from turn 80 to 91.\n\nThe turn when position is 9 is 92.\n\nt1 + H -1 should be 92.\n\nWith H=12 actions, t1 + H -1 =80 +12 -1=91, but 91 !=92.\n\nSo for H=12, t1+H-1=91, but we are at 92.\n\nTo have t1+H-1=92, H-1=12, H=13, so we need 13 actions, including a92.\n\nBut at turn 92, we are at y=9, so we can do a92=S to stay, but it's unnecessary, but for the sequence, we can include it.\n\nPerhaps the sequence includes actions until the turn before reaching, but the turn reaching is t1+H-1.\n\nIn the direct case, to reach at T=88, actions a80 to a87, 8 actions, H=9, t1+H-1=80+9-1=88.\n\nActions a80 to a87 for H=8? a80 to a87 is 8 actions, t1+H-1=80+8-1=87, not 88.\n\nError.\n\nLet's calculate for direct up no cars:\n\nStart t=80 y=1\n\na80=U, t81 y=2\n\na81=U, t82 y=3\n\n...\n\na87=U, t88 y=9\n\nSo actions a80 to a87, 8 actions.\n\nAt t88 y=9.\n\nt1 + H -1 =88, t1=80, 80 + H -1=88, H-1=8, H=9.\n\nBut number of actions is 8, from a80 to a87.\n\nFor H=9, actions a80 to a88.\n\na88 would be for t88, but at t88 y=9, if we apply a88, it changes y89.\n\nBut we want position at t88 to be 9, so we should not apply action at t88 if we are already at 9.\n\nSo the sequence should be actions from t1 to t1+H-2 for reaching at t1+H-1.\n\nI think there's a confusion.\n\nPerhaps the action at turn T determines the move for that turn, and position at T is before action or after.\n\nFrom the player update: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\" where Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, position y_t, we apply a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nPosition at turn t+1 is y_{t+1}.\n\nTo have position at turn K be 9, we need y_K =9.\n\nFor K=88, y88=9.\n\ny88 = y87 + Δa87\n\nWith y87=8, a87=U, y88=9.\n\nActions applied at t=80 to 87 to set y81 to y88.\n\nNumber of actions: 8, for H=8.\n\nThen t1 + H -1 =80 +8 -1=87, but at t87 position is y87=8, not 9.\n\nAt t88 position is 9.\n\nSo for position at K, K = t1 + H\n\nBecause after H actions, position at t1 + H.\n\nFor example, after 0 actions, position at t1.\n\nAfter 1 action, position at t1+1.\n\nAfter H actions, position at t1 + H.\n\nWe want position at t1 + H to be 9.\n\nThen H is the number of actions.\n\nBut in the task, it says \"minimal number of turns H\", and \"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nLet's read the task.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\n\" such that y_{t1 + H - 1} =9 \"\n\nSo y at turn t1 + H -1 is 9.\n\nFor example, in no car case, y at t1 +8 -1 = t1+7 should be 9? But with actions, y at t1+8 is 9.\n\nt1+7 is 8.\n\nSo inconsistency.\n\nI think for the sake of this problem, I'll assume that with the sequence, we reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nIn our case, with the path, at turn 91, we can be at y=9 if we adjust.\n\nBut with the car constraint, we start at y=1 t=80, after 11 actions, at t=91, y=8 in the sequence.\n\nTo be at y=9 at t=91, we need to be at y=8 at t=90, etc.\n\nBut with the need to be at y=1 at t=84, it's tight.\n\nMax we can be at t=84 y=1.\n\nThen to y=9 at t=91, need +8 in 7 steps, impossible.\n\nSo minimal to reach y=9 is t=92 with the path.\n\nThen for the output, we can set H=13, actions a80 to a91 with a91=U to reach y9 at t92, and t1+H-1=80+13-1=92.\n\nActions from a80 to a92, but a92 is not used.\n\nIn the sequence, include a92=S or something.\n\nBut in the answer format, we list actions until we reach.\n\nI think for this, we'll proceed with the sequence I have.\n\nSo for the player, to avoid cars, we do:\n\nTurn 80: S  (stay at y=1)\n\nTurn 81: S  (y=1)\n\nTurn 82: S  (y=1)\n\nTurn 83: S  (y=1)\n\nTurn 84: U  (to y=2)\n\nTurn 85: U  (y=3)\n\nTurn 86: U  (y=4)\n\nTurn 87: U  (y=5)\n\nTurn 88: U  (y=6)\n\nTurn 89: U  (y=7)\n\nTurn 90: U  (y=8)\n\nTurn 91: U  (y=9 at turn 92)\n\nBut at turn 91, we apply U to go to y=9 at turn 92.\n\nFor the sequence, actions from turn 80 to 91.\n\nTurn t1+H-1=92, with H=12? t1+H-1=80+H-1=92, H-1=12, H=13.\n\nSo we need 13 actions, so perhaps include turn 92: S or something.\n\nBut at turn 92, we are at y=9, so we can do a92=S to stay.\n\nBut it's redundant.\n\nPerhaps the minimal H is 12 with reaching at t=91, but impossible.\n\nAnother way: perhaps we can reach y=9 at t=91 by being at y=1 at t=83 or something.\n\nStart t=80 y=1.\n\nIf we go U at t=80, t=81 y=2\n\nU t=81, t=82 y=3\n\nU t=82, t=83 y=4\n\nAt t=83 y=4, we need to be at y=1 at t=84? Impossible, as before.\n\nGo down at t=82: t=80 U, t=81 y=2\n\nt=81 D, t=82 y=1\n\nt=82 S, t=83 y=1\n\nt=83 S, t=84 y=1\n\nThen from t=84 y=1, go U to t=85 y=2, ..., up to t=91 y=8, t=92 y=9 same as before.\n\nNo gain.\n\nSo I think H=13 is minimal.\n\nSo for the answer, we'll list the actions.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 80: S\n\nTurn 81: S\n\nTurn 82: S\n\nTurn 83: S\n\nTurn 84: U\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: U\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nTurn 89: U\n\nTurn 90: U\n\nTurn 91: U\n\nThen at turn 92, y=9.\n\nFor the sequence, we have 12 actions, but H should be 13, so perhaps add Turn 92: S\n\nBut at turn 92, we are at y=9, and if we do S, stay, but it's not necessary for reaching.\n\nBut for the sequence to have H actions, we can include it.\n\nSince the position is reached at turn 92, and t1+H-1=92, with H=13, actions from t=80 to t=92.\n\na92 can be S.\n\nIn the output, list up to turn 92.\n\nBut let's see the format.\n\nI think for this context, we can output the actions as above.\n\nPerhaps the \"turns H\" includes the starting turn or not, but I think it's fine.\n\nSo for this problem, with the cars, the sequence is:\n\nTurn 80: S\n\nTurn 81: S\n\nTurn 82: S\n\nTurn 83: S\n\nTurn 84: U\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: U\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nTurn 89: U\n\nTurn 90: U\n\nTurn 91: U\n\nAnd at turn 92, position (0,9).\n\nFor the answer, we need to box it.\n\nBut H=13, but only 12 actions listed? From 80 to 91 is 12 turns.\n\nTurn 80 to 91 actions.\n\nPerhaps list H=12, but t1+H-1=80+12-1=91, position at 91 is y=8, not 9.\n\nTo have position at 91 be 9, we need to reach earlier.\n\nSuppose we start at t=80 y=1, and we go U U U U U U U U, but collision at t=84.\n\nNot possible.\n\nOr with waiting less, but we must avoid t=84 on y=2-6.\n\nSo I think it's impossible to reach before t=92.\n\nThus, with H=13, actions from a80 to a92.\n\na92: S for example.\n\nBut in the sequence, when we reach y=9 at t=92, a92 can be omitted, but for the format, include it.\n\nI think we should go with the sequence.\n\nPerhaps the collision note: when moving to new row, not considered until next turn, but in this case, it's fine.\n\nAnother point: at turn T, if we move to y_{T+1} != y_T, we are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so not collided by cars on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nBut in our path, no issue.\n\nSo I think the sequence is correct.\n\nFor the output:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 80: S \\\\ Turn 81: S \\\\ Turn 82: S \\\\ Turn 83: S \\\\ Turn 84: U \\\\ Turn 85: U \\\\ Turn 86: U \\\\ Turn 87: U \\\\ Turn 88: U \\\\ Turn 89: U \\\\ Turn 90: U \\\\ Turn 91: U }\n\nWith this, at turn 92, y=9.\n\nAnd H=12 actions, but t1+H-1=80+12-1=91, which is not 92.\n\nTo match, either set H=12 and position at 91 is 8, or accept that with 12 actions, position at 92 is 9.\n\nBut according to the definition, it should be y at t1+H-1.\n\nPerhaps in this case, for t1+H-1=92, H=13, so add Turn 92: S\n\nThen at turn 92, we do S, stay at y=9, but position at turn 92 is already 9 before action.\n\nAfter action, still 9.\n\nSo it's fine.\n\nI think for consistency, we can add it.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 80: S\n\nTurn 81: S\n\nTurn 82: S\n\nTurn 83: S\n\nTurn 84: U\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: U\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nTurn 89: U\n\nTurn 90: U\n\nTurn 91: U\n\nTurn 92: S\n\nBut Turn 92 action is after reaching, but for the sequence, it can be included.\n\nSince the goal is reached at turn 92, and we list actions up to turn 91.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n\nPerhaps the minimal turns H means the number of turns from start to reach, including start or not.\n\nBut I'll go with the sequence without the last S.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be clear.\n\nSo for this problem, the sequence is 12 actions to reach at turn 92.\n\nBut to follow the task, let's assume that with the actions, we reach at t1+H-1.\n\nIn this case, with H=12, t1+H-1=91, position at 91 is y=8, not 9.\n\nWith one more action, at t92 y=9.\n\nSo H=13 for reach at t92.\n\nI think it's better to output the actions as is.\n\nSo for the final answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 80\\) is 13. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by staying at \\(y = 1\\) until turn 83 to avoid the dangerous time at turn 84 for rows \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 6\\), and then moving up directly to \\(y = 9\\). The dangerous times for each row are:\n\n- \\(y = 1\\): dangerous at turns 94, 95, 96, 97 (safe at turn 84)\n- \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\): dangerous only at turn 84 (safe before and after)\n- \\(y = 7, 8\\): dangerous at turns 86, 87 (safe before and after)\n- \\(y = 9\\): always safe\n\nThe action sequence ensures the player is not on any dangerous row at the dangerous times:\n- From turns 80 to 83, stay at \\(y = 1\\) (safe, as danger starts at turn 94).\n- At turn 84, move up to \\(y = 2\\) (safe, as danger at \\(y = 2\\) only at turn 84, and the player arrives at turn 85).\n- From turns 85 to 91, move up each turn, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 92. The player is on lower rows at turns 86 and 87, avoiding the danger at \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 80: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 81: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 82: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 83: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 84: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 85: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 86: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 87: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 88: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 89: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 90: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 91: \\text{ U} }\n\nAt turn 92, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\). The number of actions \\(H = 12\\) corresponds to reaching at turn \\(t_1 + H = 92\\), but the task requires \\(y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\\). With \\(H = 13\\), \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 80 + 13 - 1 = 92\\), so the action at turn 92 is included as \"S\" to stay at \\(y = 9\\), making \\(H = 13\\):\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 80: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 81: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 82: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 83: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 84: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 85: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 86: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 87: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 88: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 89: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 90: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 91: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 92: \\text{ S} }\n\nThis ensures the position at turn 92 is \\((0, 9)\\) and satisfies the task requirement with minimal \\(H = 13\\).",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,1) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up, down, or stay each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are on each freeway, and they move left or right with a certain speed. For a car, the span is given by head and tail, and it moves based on direction and speed. Collision happens if at turn T, when I'm on freeway y_T, the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at that exact turn.\n\nImportant point: when I move to a new freeway, I'm not on that freeway until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and I arrive at y+1 at turn T+1. So I only check for collision on the freeway I'm currently on at each turn.\n\nCurrent turn is t_1 = 83. Player position is (0,1), so I'm on freeway y=1 at turn 83.\n\nI need to reach (0,9), which is freeway 9, but the freeways are y=1 to 8 for cars, and y=0 and y=9 are probably safe, but the goal is (0,9), so y=9. But y=9 has no cars, I assume, since cars are only on y=1 to 8. Similarly, y=0 might be safe.\n\nThe grid is from y=0 to y=9, and cars are on freeways y=1 to 8. So y=0 and y=9 should be car-free, so no collision there. But when I'm on y=9, I'm safe, and that's the goal.\n\nThe player starts at (0,1), so at turn 83, on y=1.\n\nI need to go to y=9, which is 8 levels up, but I can move up, down, or stay, so minimum moves would be 8 up moves if no cars, but cars might block, so I need to avoid collisions.\n\nAlso, I can move down or stay to wait if necessary.\n\nThe cars are moving, so their positions change over time.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions that gets me to y=9 in minimal turns H.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their positions at turn t_1 = 83.\n\nFor each car, given head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nDirection: if right, then span moves right, so at time T, position is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] for right-moving? Let's see the update:\n\nFor right-moving: span at t_1 is [τ, h], I think? In the table, it says for right: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn the car state, for freeway k, it lists cars with (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (-33, -44, right, 3)\n\nAt t_1=83, span is [τ, h] = [-44, -33] for right-moving? Direction is right, so according to the rule:\n\nRight-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → so here τ = -44, h = -33? But it says head h, tail τ, so if head is -33, tail is -44, that would mean tail is left of head, which for right-moving, if it's moving right, head should be on the right.\n\nI think I need to clarify the notation.\n\nThe car update says:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → moves left.\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → moves right.\n\nIn the span, for left-moving, it's [h, τ] with h > τ I assume, since moving left, head on left.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, [τ, h] with τ < h, head on right.\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nSo for freeway 1: head = -33, tail = -44, direction right, speed 3.\n\nSince direction right, span at t_1 is [τ, h] = [-44, -33]\n\nAnd at time T, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-44 + 3(T-83), -33 + 3(T-83)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nCollision when I'm on freeway y at turn T, and for the car on y, 0 is in Span(T), meaning min(span) <= 0 <= max(span)\n\nSince span is an interval.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to see when cars are present at x=0.\n\nBut multiple cars per freeway? From the table, some have multiple cars.\n\nLet's list all cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-33, -44, right, 3) so span at t_1: [-44, -33]\n\nFreeway 2: one car? (-12, -23, right, 12) so [ -23, -12 ] at t_1\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2? (-12, -23, right, 12) so [ -23, -12 ]\n\nFreeway 4: same (-12, -23, right, 12) [ -23, -12 ]\n\nFreeway 5: same (-12, -23, right, 12) [ -23, -12 ]\n\nFreeway 6: two cars: (-12, -23, right, 12) and (60, 49, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: head -12, tail -23, right, so span [ -23, -12 ]\n\nSecond car: head 60, tail 49, right, so span [49, 60]\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (-18, -29, right, 6) and (30, 19, right, 6)\n\nFirst: head -18, tail -29, right, span [ -29, -18 ]\n\nSecond: head 30, tail 19, right, span [19, 30]\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7: (-18, -29, right, 6) and (30, 19, right, 6), so spans [ -29, -18 ] and [19, 30]\n\nNow, I start at turn 83 on y=1.\n\nAt each turn, when I'm on a freeway, I need that no car on that freeway has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nSince I might stay or move, but when I move, I'm on the current freeway until I change.\n\nAt turn T, I am on some y_T, and I take action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nBut for collision, at turn T, I check the car on y_T at that turn T.\n\nIf I am on y_T at turn T, and for the car(s) on y_T, 0 is in their span at turn T, collision.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when it is safe to be on it, i.e., when no car covers x=0.\n\nSince the cars move at constant speed, I can find the times when a car covers x=0.\n\nFor a car, the span at time T: let Δt = T - t_1 = T - 83\n\nFor a right-moving car with span at t_1: [τ, h]\n\nAt T, [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt]\n\n0 is in span if τ + s Δt <= 0 <= h + s Δt\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all cars are right-moving, I think? Direction is given, all are right in this case.\n\nFrom the table, all directions are right, so all cars moving right.\n\nSo for any car, 0 in span iff min_span + s Δt <= 0 <= max_span + s Δt\n\nSince the span is [low, high] with low <= high.\n\nFor right-moving, low = τ, high = h\n\nAt T, low_T = τ + s Δt, high_T = h + s Δt\n\n0 in [low_T, high_T] iff low_T <= 0 <= high_T\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but no left here.\n\nNow, low_T <= 0 <= high_T iff low_T <= 0 and 0 <= high_T\n\nWhich is τ + s Δt <= 0 and 0 <= h + s Δt\n\nThen τ + s Δt <= 0 implies Δt <= -τ/s\n\nAnd 0 <= h + s Δt implies Δt >= -h/s\n\nLet's solve:\n\nFrom low_T <= 0: τ + s Δt <= 0 ⇒ s Δt <= -τ ⇒ Δt <= -τ/s  (since s>0)\n\nFrom 0 <= high_T: 0 <= h + s Δt ⇒ s Δt >= -h ⇒ Δt >= -h/s\n\nSo 0 is in span when -h/s <= Δt <= -τ/s\n\nSince τ < h usually, -h/s <= -τ/s, so it's a time interval.\n\nNow, since the car may not be present at all times, but in this case, since it's moving linearly, it will cover x=0 at some point if the span crosses x=0.\n\nFor each car, I can find when it covers x=0.\n\nThen for a freeway, if there are multiple cars, I need when no car covers x=0.\n\nBut some freeways have multiple cars.\n\nLet me compute for each freeway the unsafe times, when at least one car covers x=0.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car, τ = -44, h = -33, s=3, right-moving.\n\nΔt >= -h/s = -(-33)/3 = 33/3 = 11\n\nΔt <= -τ/s = -(-44)/3 = 44/3 ≈ 14.666\n\nSo Δt from 11 to 44/3 ≈14.666, so for Δt=11,12,13,14? Δt is integer, since turns are discrete.\n\nΔt = T - 83, integer.\n\nSo Δt >= ceil(-h/s) and Δt <= floor(-τ/s)? Let's see.\n\nΔt must satisfy Δt >= -h/s and Δt <= -τ/s\n\nSince s>0, -h/s and -τ/s.\n\nh = -33, so -h = -(-33) = 33\n\nτ = -44, -τ = -(-44) = 44\n\nSo Δt >= 33 / 3 = 11\n\nΔt <= 44 / 3 ≈ 14.666\n\nSince Δt integer, Δt <= 14.666, so Δt <= 14? 44/3 = 14 + 2/3, so floor is 14.\n\nΔt <= -τ/s = 44/3 ≈14.666, so since Δt integer, Δt <= 14\n\nSimilarly, Δt >= 11\n\nSo for Δt =11,12,13,14, the car covers x=0 on freeway 1.\n\nAt Δt=11: low_T = τ + s Δt = -44 + 3*11 = -44 + 33 = -11\n\nhigh_T = h + s Δt = -33 + 33 =0\n\n0 <= high_T is 0 <=0, true, and low_T <=0: -11 <=0 true, so 0 in span.\n\nAt Δt=12: low_T=-44+36= -8, high_T=-33+36=3, 0 in [-8,3]\n\nΔt=13: low_T=-44+39= -5, high_T=-33+39=6, 0 in [-5,6]\n\nΔt=14: low_T=-44+42= -2, high_T=-33+42=9, 0 in [-2,9]\n\nΔt=15: low_T=-44+45=1, high_T=-33+45=12, 0 not <= high_T? 0 <=12 true, but low_T=1 >0, so 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSimilarly, Δt=10: low_T=-44+30= -14, high_T=-33+30= -3, 0 not <= high_T since -3<0, so no.\n\nSo unsafe at Δt=11,12,13,14 for freeway 1.\n\nNow freeway 2: one car, τ=-23, h=-12, s=12\n\nΔt >= -h/s = -(-12)/12 = 12/12=1\n\nΔt <= -τ/s = -(-23)/12 = 23/12 ≈1.916\n\nSo Δt >=1 and Δt <=1.916\n\nΔt integer, so Δt=1 only? Δt=1: low_T= -23 +12*1= -11, high_T= -12 +12=0? h=-12, s=12, Δt=1\n\nhigh_T = h + s Δt = -12 + 12*1 =0\n\nlow_T = τ + s Δt = -23 +12 = -11\n\n0 in [-11,0] yes.\n\nΔt=2: low_T= -23+24=1, high_T= -12+24=12, 0 not in [1,12]\n\nΔt=0: low_T=-23, high_T=-12, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo only unsafe at Δt=1 for freeway 2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as 2, car (-12,-23,right,12), so same as above, unsafe only at Δt=1.\n\nFreeway 4: same, unsafe Δt=1.\n\nFreeway 5: same, unsafe Δt=1.\n\nNow freeway 6: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-12,-23,right,12) same as above, unsafe at Δt=1\n\nSecond car: head=60, tail=49, right, s=12\n\nSpan at t_1: [τ,h] = [49,60] since right-moving.\n\nNow, when 0 in span: low_T <=0 <= high_T\n\nlow_T = τ + s Δt =49 +12 Δt\n\nhigh_T = h + s Δt =60 +12 Δt\n\nNow, low_T <=0: 49 +12 Δt <=0? 12 Δt <= -49, Δt <= -49/12 ≈ -4.083, but Δt = T-83 >=0, since future turns, so 49 +12 Δt >=49>0, so low_T >0 for all Δt>=0, so 0 never <= low_T since low_T >0, and 0 <= high_T always true since high_T >=60>0, but 0 <= high_T true, but low_T >0 so 0 not in [low_T, high_T] since low_T >0.\n\nSo this car never covers x=0. Safe always for this car.\n\nSo for freeway 6, only the first car matters, unsafe at Δt=1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: head=-18, tail=-29, right, s=6\n\nSpan: [τ,h] = [-29,-18]\n\nUnsafe when:\n\nΔt >= -h/s = -(-18)/6 =18/6=3\n\nΔt <= -τ/s = -(-29)/6=29/6≈4.833\n\nSo Δt >=3 and Δt <=4.833, so Δt=3,4\n\nΔt=3: low_T=-29+6*3=-29+18=-11, high_T=-18+18=0, 0 in [-11,0]\n\nΔt=4: low_T=-29+24=-5, high_T=-18+24=6, 0 in [-5,6]\n\nΔt=5: low_T=-29+30=1, high_T=-18+30=12, 0 not in\n\nSo unsafe Δt=3,4\n\nSecond car: head=30, tail=19, right, s=6\n\nSpan [19,30]\n\nlow_T=19+6Δt >0, high_T>0, so never covers x=0. Safe.\n\nSo freeway 7 unsafe at Δt=3,4\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: same as 7, two cars, first one unsafe at Δt=3,4, second safe, so unsafe Δt=3,4\n\nNow, freeway 1 unsafe at Δt=11,12,13,14\n\nBut I need to go up to y=9.\n\ny from 1 to 9, so I need to traverse freeways 1 through 8, but I start on y=1 at turn 83.\n\ny=1 is freeway 1, which has cars.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to y=8, each with cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 no cars.\n\nI start at turn 83 on y=1.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nAt each turn, I choose action U, D, or S, changing y by +1, -1, 0, but y clamped to [0,9].\n\nSince I start at y=1 and need to go to y=9, I probably want to go up, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid collisions.\n\nMinimal H would be at least 8, since I need to increase y by 8.\n\nBut with cars, I might need more turns if I have to stay or move down to avoid being on a freeway when it's unsafe.\n\nNow, let's list the unsafe times for each freeway relative to Δt = T - 83.\n\n- y=1: unsafe Δt=11,12,13,14\n\n- y=2: unsafe Δt=1\n\n- y=3: unsafe Δt=1\n\n- y=4: unsafe Δt=1\n\n- y=5: unsafe Δt=1\n\n- y=6: unsafe Δt=1 (from first car)\n\n- y=7: unsafe Δt=3,4\n\n- y=8: unsafe Δt=3,4\n\nΔt=0 is current turn, t_1=83.\n\nAt Δt=0, turn 83, I am on y=1.\n\nIs y=1 unsafe at Δt=0? From above, unsafe at 11,12,13,14, not at 0, so at Δt=0, y=1 is safe? Let's check.\n\nFor y=1, at Δt=0: low_T = τ + s*0 = -44, high_T = -33, both negative, so 0 not in span, safe.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways at Δt=0:\n\ny=2: Δt=0, low_T=-23, high_T=-12, both neg, safe.\n\nAll freeways at Δt=0 are safe, since the unsafe times are later.\n\nNow, I need to get to y=9.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so once I'm on y=9, I'm safe, but I need to be at (0,9), so when I move to y=9, I arrive at turn T+1 if I move at turn T.\n\nLet's think about the sequence.\n\nAt turn T, I am on y_T, and I choose action a_T, which sets y_{T+1}.\n\nFor collision, at turn T, I am on y_T, so I need that at turn T, for freeway y_T, it is safe, meaning no car covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nThen I move to y_{T+1} at the next turn.\n\nI start at turn 83, y=1, which is safe as above.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nTo reach y=9, I must have y_T = 8 at some turn T, and then I move up to y=9 at turn T, so at turn T I am on y=8, and I take U, then at turn T+1 I am on y=9.\n\nAt turn T+1, I am on y=9, no cars, so no collision.\n\nBut at turn T, I need to be on y=8 and it must be safe, and I take U.\n\nSimilarly, to be on y=8, I might have come from y=7 or y=8 by staying or moving.\n\nBut minimal path is to go up directly if possible.\n\nBut with unsafe times, I need to avoid being on a freeway when it is unsafe.\n\nNow, the unsafe times are clustered.\n\nSpecifically, for y=2,3,4,5,6 all unsafe only at Δt=1.\n\ny=7 and 8 unsafe at Δt=3,4\n\ny=1 unsafe at Δt=11-14\n\nΔt=1 is turn 84 (since t_1=83, Δt=1 is T=84)\n\nΔt=0: T=83\n\nΔt=1: T=84\n\nΔt=2: T=85\n\netc.\n\nAt Δt=1 (turn 84), freeways y=2,3,4,5,6 are all unsafe. But y=2,3,4,5,6 are unsafe only at that time, but at that exact turn, if I am on one of them, collision.\n\ny=1 is safe at Δt=1, since unsafe only at 11-14.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 and 8 safe at Δt=1, unsafe at 3,4.\n\nNow, I start at turn 83, y=1.\n\nI need to go up to y=9.\n\nThe critical point is that at turn 84 (Δt=1), I cannot be on y=2,3,4,5,6 because they are all unsafe.\n\nBut I might be on y=1 or y=7 or y=8 or other.\n\ny=7 and 8 are safe at Δt=1.\n\ny=1 is also safe at Δt=1.\n\nBut if I want to go up, from y=1, if I go up at turn 83, I move to y=2 at turn 84.\n\nBut at turn 84, if I am on y=2, it is unsafe, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay on y=1 at turn 83, I am still on y=1 at turn 84, which is safe.\n\nThen at turn 84, I can do something.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nSince at turn 84, y=2 to y=6 are all unsafe, I cannot be on them at that turn.\n\nSo at turn 84, I must be on y=1, or y=7, or y=8, or y=0, or y=9.\n\nBut y=0 and y=9 are safe, but I start at y=1, and y=0 is below.\n\nNow, y=7 and 8 are safe at turn 84, but I am at y=1, how can I be on y=7 or 8 at turn 84? I can only move one step per turn, so from y=1 at turn 83, at turn 84 I can be on y=0, y=1, or y=2.\n\nI cannot be on y=7 or 8 directly.\n\nSo at turn 84, possible positions: y=0,1,2 only.\n\ny=2 is unsafe, so I cannot be on y=2 at turn 84.\n\nTherefore, at turn 84, I must be on y=0 or y=1 to avoid collision.\n\nIf I take U at turn 83, I go to y=2 at turn 84, unsafe.\n\nIf I take S, stay on y=1, safe.\n\nIf I take D, go to y=0 at turn 84.\n\ny=0 has no cars, so safe.\n\nNow, similarly, I need to consider later turns.\n\nAlso, y=7 and 8 are unsafe at Δt=3 and 4, i.e., turns 86 and 87.\n\nΔt=3: T=83+3=86\n\nΔt=4: T=87\n\nNow, back to turn 84.\n\nAt turn 84, I must not be on y=2-6, so I must be on y=0 or y=1.\n\nCase 1: at turn 83, I take S, so at turn 84 I am on y=1.\n\nCase 2: at turn 83, I take D, so at turn 84 I am on y=0.\n\nNow, from there, I need to go to y=9.\n\nFirst, suppose I stay on y=1 at turn 83.\n\nSo action at turn 83: S\n\nThen at turn 84, on y=1.\n\nNow, at turn 84, I need to choose action.\n\ny=1 is safe at turn 84 (Δt=1), since unsafe only at 11-14.\n\nNow, I can go up, down, or stay.\n\nIf I go up at turn 84, to y=2 at turn 85.\n\nBut at turn 85, what is the safety?\n\nFirst, at turn 85, Δt=2.\n\nNow, for each freeway:\n\ny=1: unsafe at 11-14, not at 2, safe.\n\ny=2: unsafe only at Δt=1, not at 2, so at Δt=2, safe? Δt=2 for y=2.\n\nEarlier: for y=2, unsafe at Δt=1 only.\n\nAt Δt=2, low_T = τ + s Δt = -23 +12*2 = -23+24=1, high_T=-12+24=12, 0 not in [1,12], so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=3,4,5,6 all same, only unsafe at Δt=1, so at Δt=2, all safe.\n\ny=7: unsafe at Δt=3,4, not at 2, safe.\n\ny=8: unsafe at 3,4, safe at 2.\n\nSo at turn 85 (Δt=2), all freeways are safe, since no unsafe at that time.\n\ny=1 unsafe at 11-14, not now.\n\nSo at turn 85, wherever I am, it should be safe, as long as I don't go to unsafe freeway, but all are safe at that turn.\n\nSimilarly, turn 86: Δt=3\n\ny=1: safe (unsafe 11-14)\n\ny=2: safe (only unsafe at1)\n\n...\n\ny=6: safe\n\ny=7: unsafe at Δt=3,4\n\ny=8: unsafe at 3,4\n\nSo at turn 86, y=7 and y=8 are unsafe.\n\nTurn 87: Δt=4, same, y=7 and 8 unsafe.\n\nTurn 88: Δt=5, all safe? y=7 unsafe at 3,4, not 5, safe; similarly others.\n\nNow back to sequence.\n\nAt turn 83: I take S, so at turn 84 I am on y=1.\n\nNow at turn 84: I can take action.\n\nIf I take U at turn 84, I go to y=2 at turn 85.\n\nAt turn 85, on y=2, which is safe, as above.\n\nThen at turn 85, I can take U to go to y=3 at turn 86.\n\nBut at turn 86, y=3 is safe, but if I go to y=3 at turn 86, I am on y=3 at turn 86.\n\ny=3 at turn 86 (Δt=3) is safe, since unsafe only at Δt=1.\n\nBut y=7 and y=8 are unsafe at turn 86.\n\nIf I am on y=3 at turn 86, it is safe.\n\nThen I can continue up.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nThe problem is when I reach y=7 or y=8, they are unsafe at turns 86 and 87.\n\nSo I need to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at turns 86 and 87.\n\nSimilarly, at other times they are safe.\n\nNow, since I am at y=1 at turn 84, and I want to go up.\n\nLet me list the turns.\n\nTurn 83: start y=1, take S, so at turn 84 y=1\n\nTurn 84: I take U, so at turn 85 y=2\n\nTurn 85: take U, to y=3 at turn 86\n\nAt turn 86, on y=3, which is safe (Δt=3, y=3 safe)\n\nTurn 86: take U, to y=4 at turn 87\n\nAt turn 87, on y=4, safe\n\nTurn 87: take U, to y=5 at turn 88\n\nAt turn 88, on y=5, safe\n\nTurn 88: take U, to y=6 at turn 89\n\nAt turn 89, on y=6, safe\n\nTurn 89: take U, to y=7 at turn 90\n\nAt turn 90, on y=7, now Δt=90-83=7\n\ny=7 unsafe at Δt=3,4, not 7, so safe.\n\nThen turn 90: take U to y=8 at turn 91\n\nAt turn 91, on y=8, Δt=8, safe\n\nTurn 91: take U to y=9 at turn 92\n\nAt turn 92, on y=9, goal.\n\nBut is this minimal? From turn 83 to 92, that's 10 turns? Let's count turns.\n\nTurn 83: action S, position y=1\n\nAfter action, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t, action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + delta.\n\nAt turn t+1, position y_{t+1}\n\nIn terms of reaching y=9 at turn T, meaning y_T =9.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nTurn 83: y=1, take S, so y84=1\n\nTurn 84: y=1, take U, y85=2\n\nTurn 85: y=2, take U, y86=3\n\nTurn 86: y=3, take U, y87=4\n\nTurn 87: y=4, take U, y88=5\n\nTurn 88: y=5, take U, y89=6\n\nTurn 89: y=6, take U, y90=7\n\nTurn 90: y=7, take U, y91=8\n\nTurn 91: y=8, take U, y92=9\n\nSo at turn 92, y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns from t1, so turns from t1 to t1+H-1? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t1 to t1+H-1, and after H actions, we reach y=9 at turn t1 + H.\n\nAt turn t1, position given.\n\nAfter first action at t1, we go to turn t1+1 with new y.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t1 + H with position y_{t1+H}.\n\nAnd we want y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nIn this case, from above, at turn 92, y=9.\n\nt1=83, so t1 + H =92, so H=9? t1 + H =92, 83 + H =92, H=9.\n\nBut number of actions: from turn 83 to 91, actions at t=83 to 91, that's 9 actions, reaching at turn 92.\n\nThe minimal possible is 8 actions, if I go up directly without stopping.\n\nBut at turn 83, if I take U, to y=2 at turn 84.\n\nBut at turn 84, y=2 is unsafe, collision.\n\nSo I cannot.\n\nIf I take D at turn 83, to y=0 at turn 84.\n\ny=0 safe.\n\nThen at turn 84, on y=0.\n\nI can take U to y=1 at turn 85.\n\nAt turn 85, y=1, safe.\n\nThen from there, I can go up, similar to before.\n\nBut from y=0 at turn 84, take U to y=1 at turn 85.\n\nThen turn 85: y=1, take U to y=2 at turn 86.\n\nAt turn 86, y=2, which is safe (since unsafe only at Δt=1, now Δt=3? turn 86 is t=86, Δt=86-83=3, y=2 safe.\n\nThen continue up: turn 86: to y=3 at turn 87\n\nTurn 87: on y=3, safe\n\nTo y=4 at turn 88\n\n...\n\nUp to y=8 at turn 92? Let's see:\n\nTurn 84: y=0, take U, y85=1\n\nTurn 85: y=1, take U, y86=2\n\nTurn 86: y=2, take U, y87=3\n\nTurn 87: y=3, take U, y88=4\n\nTurn 88: y=4, take U, y89=5\n\nTurn 89: y=5, take U, y90=6\n\nTurn 90: y=6, take U, y91=7\n\nTurn 91: y=7, take U, y92=8\n\nTurn 92: y=8, take U, y93=9\n\nSo reach at turn 93, later than previous sequence.\n\nWorse.\n\nAfter reaching y=1 at turn 85, I can go faster, but I have to deal with y=7 and 8 unsafe at 86 and 87.\n\nIn the first sequence, I reached at turn 92 with 9 turns.\n\nBut earlier I thought about the unsafe at 86 and 87 for y=7 and 8.\n\nIn the first sequence, I was on y=7 at turn 90, which is Δt=7, safe, no problem.\n\nBut can I reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if I can be on higher y earlier.\n\nBut at turn 84, I cannot be on y=2-6 because unsafe.\n\nSo I must be on y=0 or 1 at turn 84.\n\nThen at turn 85, all safe, I can move up.\n\nBut to go from y=1 to y=9, I need at least 8 moves up, but since I start at turn 83 y=1, if I could go up every turn, I would be at y=9 at turn 91: turn 83 U to y=2 at 84, but unsafe, not possible.\n\nNext possibility: at turn 83 S, y84=1\n\nThen turn 84 U, to y=2 at 85, safe.\n\nThen I can go up each turn.\n\nBut when I reach y=7 and y=8.\n\nIf I go up fast:\n\nTurn 83: S, y84=1\n\nTurn 84: U, y85=2\n\nTurn 85: U, y86=3\n\nAt turn 86, on y=3, safe.\n\nNow, if I take U at turn 86, to y=4 at turn 87.\n\nTurn 87, on y=4, safe.\n\nTake U to y=5 at turn 88.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut y=7 and 8 are unsafe at turn 86 and 87.\n\nAt turn 86, if I am on y=3, I take U to y=4 at turn 87.\n\nI am not on y=7 or 8 at turn 86 or 87.\n\nTurn 86: on y=3\n\nTurn 87: on y=4\n\n...\n\nThen turn 88: on y=5, take U to y=6 at 89\n\nTurn 89: on y=6, take U to y=7 at 90\n\nTurn 90: on y=7, Δt=7, safe, take U to y=8 at 91\n\nTurn 91: on y=8, Δt=8, safe (unsafe at 3,4 only), take U to y=9 at 92.\n\nSame as before.\n\nCan I be on y=7 or 8 earlier?\n\nFor example, if I could be on y=7 before turn 86 or after turn 87.\n\nBut since I start from low, I can only reach high y later.\n\nMinimal turns to reach y=9 from y=1 is 8 moves up.\n\nBut I cannot move up at turn 83 because of turn 84 unsafe.\n\nSo I have to waste one turn at the beginning.\n\nThen from turn 84 y=1, I need 8 up moves to reach y=9 at turn 92.\n\nIf I go down to y=0, it takes more turns.\n\nBut earlier with down: turn 83 D to y=0 at 84\n\nThen turn 84 U to y=1 at 85\n\nThen from y=1 at 85, I need to go to y=9, which takes 8 more moves, so at turn 93, worse.\n\nSo staying at y=1 at turn 84 is better.\n\nBut is there a way to avoid the later unsafe times or something.\n\ny=7 and 8 unsafe at turns 86 and 87, but in the sequence above, I am not on them at that time, so no issue.\n\nBut perhaps I can go faster in the middle.\n\nFor example, after turn 85, I am on y=2.\n\nI could stay or something, but going up is faster.\n\nSince all freeways are safe at turn 85 (Δt=2), I can move up freely until I reach y=7 or 8.\n\nBut y=7 and 8 are only unsafe at 86 and 87, which are before I reach them in the sequence.\n\nIn the sequence, I reach y=7 at turn 90, which is after.\n\nNow, another thing: at turn 84, if I am on y=1, and I take S again, but that would delay, not good.\n\nOr take D, worse.\n\nSo best is to take U at turn 84 to go to y=2 at 85.\n\nThen U each turn.\n\nBut at turn 86 and 87, I am on y=3 and y=4, which are safe.\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut can I reach y=9 before turn 92?\n\nFor example, if I start going up later but faster, but I have to be careful not to be on unsafe when moving.\n\nSuppose at turn 83 I take S, y84=1\n\nThen at turn 84, instead of U, I take S again, y85=1\n\nThen at turn 85, take U to y=2 at 86\n\nAt turn 86, on y=2, safe? turn 86 Δt=3, y=2 safe.\n\nThen take U to y=3 at 87\n\nAnd so on, but now I reach later: y=2 at 86, y=3 at 87, ..., up to y=9 at 93 or 94, worse.\n\nNot better.\n\nPerhaps go down to y=0 at some point, but that seems counterproductive.\n\nAnother idea: since at turn 84, I must avoid y=2-6, but I am on y=1, safe.\n\nThen at turn 85, all safe, I can go to y=2,3,4,5,6 if I want, all safe.\n\nBut I need to go up, so go to y=2.\n\nBut to save time, I could go directly to higher y, but I can only move one step per turn.\n\nUnless I stay, but staying doesn't help.\n\nPerhaps for y=7 and 8, since they are unsafe at 86 and 87, I need to be on them before or after.\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=7 at turn 85 or earlier, but I start at y=1 at 83, at turn 85 I can be at most y=3 if I go up twice: but at turn 83 U not possible, so at turn 85, from y=1 at 84, U to y=2 at 85, so y=2 max at turn 85.\n\nCannot reach y=7 early.\n\nAfter turn 87, y=7 and 8 are safe.\n\nIn the sequence, I am on them after.\n\nBut in the first sequence, I reach y=7 at turn 90, which is fine.\n\nBut H=9, from turn 83 to 91 actions, 9 actions.\n\nMinimal should be 8, but not possible due to initial block.\n\nPerhaps I can go up at turn 83 to y=2 at 84, but unsafe, not allowed.\n\nUnless I can avoid collision by moving away, but at that turn, if I am on it, collision happens.\n\nNo, I have to not be on unsafe freeway at unsafe time.\n\nSo I think 9 is minimal.\n\nBut let me confirm the sequence.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 83: S (stay at y=1, so at turn 84 y=1)\n\nTurn 84: U (to y=2 at 85)\n\nTurn 85: U (to y=3 at 86)\n\nTurn 86: U (to y=4 at 87)\n\nTurn 87: U (to y=5 at 88)\n\nTurn 88: U (to y=6 at 89)\n\nTurn 89: U (to y=7 at 90)\n\nTurn 90: U (to y=8 at 91)\n\nTurn 91: U (to y=9 at 92)\n\nAt each turn, when I am on a freeway, is it safe?\n\nTurn 83: on y=1, Δt=0, safe as before.\n\nTurn 84: on y=1, Δt=1, y=1 unsafe only at 11-14, not now, safe.\n\nTurn 85: on y=2, Δt=2, y=2 unsafe only at Δt=1, not now, safe.\n\nTurn 86: on y=3, Δt=3, y=3 unsafe only at Δt=1, not now, safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 87: on y=4, Δt=4, safe.\n\nTurn 88: on y=5, Δt=5, safe.\n\nTurn 89: on y=6, Δt=6, safe.\n\nTurn 90: on y=7, Δt=7, y=7 unsafe at 3,4, not 7, safe.\n\nTurn 91: on y=8, Δt=8, unsafe at 3,4, not 8, safe.\n\nThen at turn 92, on y=9, goal.\n\nNow, H=9, with actions from t=83 to t=91.\n\nBut the sequence is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, so 9 actions.\n\nIn the answer, it should be the actions starting from turn t1.\n\nIn the boxed format.\n\nBut is there a shorter sequence?\n\nSuppose at turn 83, I take D to y=0 at 84.\n\nThen turn 84 on y=0, safe.\n\nThen I can take U to y=1 at 85.\n\nThen from y=1 at 85, I need to go up.\n\nBut at turn 85, Δt=2, safe.\n\nTake U to y=2 at 86.\n\nThen U to y=3 at 87.\n\nU to y=4 at 88.\n\n...\n\nUp to U to y=8 at 92, then U to y=9 at 93.\n\nReach at 93, worse.\n\nAfter being on y=0 at 84, I could go up faster, but no.\n\nAnother idea: since y=7 and 8 are unsafe at 86 and 87, I could be on them before 86.\n\nBut at turn 85, max y I can be is y=2, as above.\n\nIf I start from turn 83, take S to y=1 at 84.\n\nThen at turn 84, take U to y=2 at 85.\n\nAt turn 85, on y=2, take U to y=3 at 86.\n\nAt turn 86, on y=3.\n\nNow, instead of going to y=4, I could stay or something, but I need to go up.\n\nIf I stay at turn 86 on y=3, take S, so y87=3.\n\nThen at turn 87, on y=3, take U to y=4 at 88.\n\nThen continue, but I reach later.\n\nNot better.\n\nFrom y=3 at turn 86, I go up to y=4 at 87, same as before.\n\nI think 9 is the minimal.\n\nBut let me check if I can reach y=9 by turn 91.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn 91, that means at turn 91, y=9.\n\nThen at turn 90, I must have been on y=8 and took U.\n\nAt turn 90, on y=8, must be safe.\n\nturn 90 is Δt=7, y=8 safe.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 89, I must be on y=7 or y=8 or y=9, but to be on y=8 at turn 90, at turn 89 I could be on y=7,8, or 9.\n\nBut if on y=9 at turn 89, I am already goal, but we want to reach, so probably not.\n\nTo be on y=8 at turn 90, I need to be on y=7 or y=8 at turn 89.\n\nIf on y=7 at turn 89, take U to y=8 at 90.\n\nOr on y=8 at turn 89, take S or U to y=9, but if take U to y=9 at 90, then at turn 90 y=9.\n\nBut let's see the earliest.\n\nAt turn 89, to be on y=7 or 8.\n\nturn 89 is Δt=6, y=7 and 8 safe.\n\nNow, to be on y=7 at turn 89.\n\nThat means at turn 88, I was on y=6 or y=7 and took action to y=7.\n\nSimilarly, trace back.\n\nBut at turn 84, I must be on y=0 or 1.\n\nSuppose at turn 84 I am on y=1.\n\nThen at turn 85, I can be on y=0,1,2.\n\nBut y=2 is safe at turn 85.\n\nTo reach y=7 at turn 89, I need to increase y by 6 from turn 85 to 89, that's 5 turns: turns 85,86,87,88,89.\n\nFrom turn 85 to turn 89, 4 actions? Positions.\n\nAt turn 85 position y_85.\n\nAfter actions at turn 85,86,87,88, I get y_89.\n\nWith 4 actions, I can increase y by at most 4, so from y_85, y_89 <= y_85 +4.\n\nIf y_85=1, y_89 <=5, cannot be 7.\n\nIf y_85=2, y_89 <=6.\n\nStill not 7.\n\nIf at turn 85 I am on y=2, then with actions at 85,86,87,88, y_89 <=2+4=6.\n\nCannot reach y=7.\n\nTo reach y=7 at turn 89, I need y_89=7.\n\ny_89 is set by action at turn 88.\n\nAt turn 88, I am on some y, take action, y_89 = y_88 + delta.\n\ny_89=7, so at turn 88, I must have been on y=6,7, or 8.\n\nIf on y=6, take U to y=7.\n\nIf on y=7, take S to stay, or D to y=6, but not to 7.\n\nTo get y_89=7, I must have y_88 <=7 and take appropriate action.\n\nSimilarly, y_88 depends on earlier.\n\nBut at turn 84, y_84=0 or 1.\n\nThen y_85: from y_84, so y_85 = y_84 + delta, so y_85 <= y_84 +1 <=2 if y_84=1, or 1 if y_84=0.\n\nThen y_86 <= y_85 +1 <=3\n\ny_87 <= y_86 +1 <=4\n\ny_88 <= y_87 +1 <=5\n\ny_89 <= y_88 +1 <=6\n\nSo y_89 <=6, cannot be 7 at turn 89.\n\nSimilarly, cannot reach y=9 by turn 91.\n\nEarliest is turn 92, with y_92=9.\n\nAs in the sequence.\n\nThus minimal H=9.\n\nNow, in the sequence, actions are: S at 83, then U from 84 to 91, that's one S and eight U, total nine actions.\n\nIn the sequence: turn 83: S, then turns 84 to 91: all U, so eight U after, but from 84 to 91 is 8 turns, actions.\n\nturns: 83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91: nine actions.\n\nAction at 83: S\n\n84: U\n\n85: U\n\n86: U\n\n87: U\n\n88: U\n\n89: U\n\n90: U\n\n91: U\n\nAnd y92=9.\n\nNow, to write in the answer format.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions\"\n\nH is the number of turns, I think H=9.\n\nIn the context, \"minimal number of turns H\" and sequence from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1.\n\nLet me see.\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nSo t from 0 to H-1, so actions at time t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter these H actions, we reach at time t1 + H.\n\nIn this case, t1=83, actions at 83 to 83+H-1, reach at 83+H.\n\nSet 83+H = 92, so H=9.\n\nActions at t=83 to 91.\n\nSequence: a_{83} = S\n\na_{84} = U\n\na_{85} = U\n\n...\n\na_{91} = U\n\nNow, in the boxed format.\n\nBut I think I should write it clearly.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid the initial stay by going down, but it takes more turns.\n\nAnother thought: at turn 83, take D to y=0 at 84.\n\nThen at turn 84, on y=0, take U to y=1 at 85.\n\nThen at turn 85, on y=1, take U to y=2 at 86.\n\n...\n\nBut as before, reach later.\n\nNot better.\n\nPerhaps for y=7 and 8, since unsafe at 86 and 87, I could go directly from y=6 to y=8 or something, but I can only move one step, so I have to go through y=7.\n\nUnless I stay, but staying doesn't skip.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo minimal H=9.\n\nNow, about freeway 1 unsafe at later times, but in this sequence, I am not on y=1 after turn 84, and at turn 84 it was safe, no issue.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSo the sequence should work.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 6,7,8, I have multiple cars, but I think I handled, only the relevant ones affect x=0.\n\nFor example, freeway 6 has two cars, but only first one affects, and only at Δt=1.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nThus, actions:\n\nTurn 83: S\n\nTurn 84: U\n\nTurn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: U\n\nTurn 87: U\n\nTurn 88: U\n\nTurn 89: U\n\nTurn 90: U\n\nTurn 91: U\n\nIn the sequence, from turn 86 to 91, I am going up through y=3 to y=8, but y=7 and 8 unsafe at 86 and 87, but I am on y=3 at 86, y=4 at 87, not on 7 or 8, so fine.\n\nAt turn 90, on y=7, safe.\n\nSo all good.\n\nNow, H=9.\n\nBut let me confirm the number.\n\nStart at t=83, y=1.\n\nAfter action a83, y84\n\n...\n\nAfter a91, y92=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=83 to t=91, that's 9 actions.\n\nH=9.\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to H-1, so for t=0, a_{t1 +0} = a83\n\nt=1, a84, ..., t=8, a91.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 83: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 84: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 85: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 86: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 87: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 88: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 89: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 90: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 91: & U \\end{array} }\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so I think it's fine.\n\nSince t1=83, and H=9.\n\nBut the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" so for each turn.\n\nIn the box, I need to write the actions.\n\nPerhaps I can write it as text.\n\nBut in the format given.\n\nAnyway, I think this is the minimal.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose at turn 83, I take S.\n\nThen at turn 84, take S again? Then at turn 85, take U to y=2 at 86.\n\nThen U to y=3 at 87, etc., reach y=9 at turn 93, worse.\n\nOr, from turn 84 y=1, take D to y=0 at 85, then U to y=1 at 86, then U to y=2 at 87, etc., even later.\n\nNot better.\n\nPerhaps I can go up faster after, but I think 9 is minimal.\n\nSo I think this is the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 83\\) is 9. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on an unsafe freeway at the times when cars cover \\(x = 0\\).\n\n### Key Points:\n- At turn 84 (relative time \\(\\Delta t = 1\\)), freeways \\(y = 2\\) to \\(y = 6\\) are unsafe due to cars covering \\(x = 0\\). Therefore, the player must be on \\(y = 0\\) or \\(y = 1\\) at this turn to avoid collision.\n- Starting at \\(y = 1\\) at turn 83, taking action \\(S\\) (stay) at turn 83 keeps the player on \\(y = 1\\) at turn 84, which is safe.\n- From turn 84 onwards, all freeways are safe at the relevant times, allowing the player to move up (\\(U\\)) each turn without collision.\n- The player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 92 after 9 actions (turns 83 to 91).\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- Turn 83: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 1\\), safe as \\(y = 1\\) is not unsafe at \\(\\Delta t = 0\\))\n- Turn 84: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 85; \\(y = 1\\) is safe at \\(\\Delta t = 1\\))\n- Turn 85: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 86; \\(y = 2\\) is safe at \\(\\Delta t = 2\\))\n- Turn 86: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 87; \\(y = 3\\) is safe at \\(\\Delta t = 3\\))\n- Turn 87: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 88; \\(y = 4\\) is safe at \\(\\Delta t = 4\\))\n- Turn 88: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 89; \\(y = 5\\) is safe at \\(\\Delta t = 5\\))\n- Turn 89: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 90; \\(y = 6\\) is safe at \\(\\Delta t = 6\\))\n- Turn 90: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 91; \\(y = 7\\) is safe at \\(\\Delta t = 7\\))\n- Turn 91: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 92; \\(y = 8\\) is safe at \\(\\Delta t = 8\\))\n\nAt turn 92, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\), and since \\(y = 9\\) has no cars, it is safe.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in the minimal \\(H = 9\\) turns, as any attempt to reach \\(y = 9\\) in fewer turns (e.g., by moving up at turn 83) would result in a collision at turn 84 on \\(y = 2\\), and alternative paths (e.g., moving down to \\(y = 0\\)) take more turns.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 83: & S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 84: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 85: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 86: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 87: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 88: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 89: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 90: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 91: & U \\end{array} }",

I need to get to (0, 9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe car positions are given for each freeway at turn t_1. I need to find where these cars will be at future turns to avoid being on the same freeway when the car spans include x=0.\n\nThe collision rule: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T, and for any car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at that turn, then collision occurs. Importantly, if you move to a different y, you're not on that freeway until the next turn. So when you decide to move at turn T, you change position at turn T+1.\n\nLet me clarify the update:\n\n- At turn t, player position is y_t.\n\n- Action a_t is taken, which determines Δy_t.\n\n- Then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo, when you take action a_t at turn t, it affects your position at turn t+1.\n\nFor collision: at turn T, you are on freeway y_T. If for any car on freeway y_T, 0 is in Span(T) for that car, then collision.\n\nSpan(T) is the position of the car at turn T, given its state at t_1.\n\nThe car update: for a car, at turn t_1, it has head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nThen at turn T > t_1:\n\nIf left-moving, Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the problem, left-moving is given as: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nBut [h, τ] with h and τ, but for left-moving, if it's moving left, head should be the front, so if moving left, head is decreasing, so [h, τ] might imply h < τ or something? I need to be careful with the notation.\n\nLook at the car state:\n\nFor freeway 1: (-27, -38, right, 3) — head -27, tail -38, direction right.\n\nIf direction is right, and head is -27, tail is -38, since -27 > -38, so head is at the right end, so for right-moving, head should be larger.\n\nIn the update: for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s) = (-27, -38, right, 3)\n\nBut for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so here τ = -38, h = -27, so [τ, h] = [-38, -27], which is increasing, so head is at h=-27, which is the right end.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h, τ] with h decreasing.\n\nBut in this problem, all cars seem to be right-moving except possibly, let's see the directions.\n\nIn the given:\n\nFreeway 1: (-27, -38, right, 3) — right-moving\n\nFreeway 2: (12, 1, right, 12) — right-moving\n\nSimilarly, 3,4,5 all (12,1,right,12)\n\nFreeway 6: (12,1,right,12) and (-36,-47,right,12) — both right\n\nFreeway 7: (-6,-17,right,6) and (42,31,right,6) — both right, but (42,31), 42>31, so [τ,h] = [31,42]? Tail should be left, head right.\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), and for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nSimilarly for left, [h, τ] with h decreasing.\n\nIn freeway 7: first car ( -6, -17, right, 6) — head -6, tail -17, since -6 > -17, so τ = -17, h = -6, Span = [-17, -6]\n\nSecond car (42, 31, right, 6) — head 42, tail 31, but 42 > 31, so τ=31, h=42, Span=[31,42]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8 same as 7.\n\nFreeway 6 has two cars: (12,1,right,12) and (-36,-47,right,12)\n\n(12,1): head=12, tail=1, so τ=1, h=12, Span=[1,12]\n\n(-36,-47): head=-36, tail=-47, τ=-47, h=-36, Span=[-47,-36]\n\nNow, all cars are right-moving, so for each, at turn T, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSince direction right.\n\nt_1 = 85.\n\nPlayer starts at y=2 at turn 85.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nEach action U, D, S changes y by +1, -1, 0, but y must stay in [0,9], so if at y=0, cannot go down, y=9 cannot go up.\n\nSince we start at y=2, and go to y=9, we need to go up, so actions will be mostly U, but with S or D to avoid cars.\n\nH is the number of turns, including the actions from t=0 to H-1 relative to t_1.\n\nLet t be the turn number relative to t_1. So at time t=0 (turn t_1), position y=2.\n\nAfter action a_0, at t=1, y changes, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position should be 9? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, the position is at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut we want to reach (0,9), so y_{t_1 + H} should be 9.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nAfter action at turn T, position at T+1.\n\nSo, to be at position (0,9) at some turn, say at turn t_final.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t_1 to t_final - 1, so H = t_final - t_1.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nAnd H should be minimal.\n\nNow, collision: at each turn T, when we are at y_T, if for any car on freeway y_T, 0 is in Span(T) for that car.\n\nSpan(T) for a car depends on T relative to t_1.\n\nt_1 = 85.\n\nFor a car, at turn T, Span(T) = [τ + s(T - 85), h + s(T - 85)] for right-moving cars.\n\nSince all are right-moving.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway the car spans at time T.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: only one car: τ = -38, h = -27, s=3, direction right.\n\nSpan at T: [ -38 + 3(T-85), -27 + 3(T-85) ]\n\nSimplify: let Δt = T - 85, so Span = [ -38 + 3Δt, -27 + 3Δt ]\n\n0 is in Span if -38 + 3Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -27 + 3Δt\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: car (12,1,right,12), so τ=1, h=12, s=12\n\nSpan: [1 + 12Δt, 12 + 12Δt]\n\n0 in span? 1 + 12Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 12 + 12Δt? Since 1 + 12Δt >0 for Δt >=0, so 0 never in span. Similarly for freeway 3,4,5 same car state, so no collision possible on y=2,3,4,5? Freeway k corresponds to y=k, I think.\n\nFreeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nFreeway 1: y=1, etc.\n\nFreeway 2: car (12,1,right,12), span [1+12Δt, 12+12Δt], for Δt>=0, min is 1>0, so 0 not in span ever.\n\nSimilarly freeway 3,4,5 same, so no cars can cause collision on y=2,3,4,5? But freeway 2 is y=2, but player starts on y=2 at t_1.\n\nAt t_1, player on y=2, but for freeway 2, at T=t_1, Δt=0, span [1,12], 0 not in [1,12], so no collision at t_1, good.\n\nAnd for future, since min is 1 +12Δt >=1, so 0 never in span, so no collision possible on freeway 2, y=2.\n\nSimilarly for y=3,4,5: all have the same car (12,1,right,12), so span [1+12Δt,12+12Δt] >=1, 0 not in, so safe at all times.\n\nFreeway 1: y=1\n\nCar: τ=-38, h=-27, s=3, span [ -38 +3Δt, -27 +3Δt ]\n\n0 in span if -38 +3Δt <= 0 <= -27 +3Δt\n\nWhich is 38/3 <= Δt <= 27/3? Let's solve:\n\n-38 +3Δt <= 0 => 3Δt <= 38 => Δt <= 38/3 ≈ 12.666, so Δt <=12 since integer?

So if we are on y=6 at T where Δt=3, collision.\n\ny=7: unsafe at Δt=1 and 2.\n\ny=8: unsafe at Δt=1 and 2.\n\nNow, we need to plan the sequence of actions.\n\nLet t be the step from t_1, so at time relative: t=0, position y=2.\n\nAfter action a_t, position at t+1.\n\nDefine the position at time k (relative) as y_k.\n\nk=0: y=2\n\nAfter action a_k at time k, position at k+1 is y_{k+1} = y_k + Δy_k\n\nFor collision: at time k, we are at y_k, and we check if on that freeway, 0 in span for any car.\n\nTime k corresponds to turn t_1 + k.\n\nΔt = k, since T = t_1 + k.\n\nSo at time k, Δt = k.\n\nNow, we need to be at y=9 at some time H, so after H actions, position at time H.\n\ny_H = 9.\n\nNow, the path: from k=0, y=2.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe constraints:\n\n- If at time k, y_k =6, then must not have k=3, because unsafe at Δt=3.\n\n- If y_k =7, must not have k=1 or 2\n\n- If y_k =8, must not have k=1 or 2\n\n- y_k=1 unsafe for k=9,10,11,12 but since we are going up, we might not be on y=1, so probably not relevant.\n\nSimilarly, other y safe.\n\nNow, min H: since we need to go from y=2 to y=9, difference 7, so H >=7.\n\nIf we can go up directly in 7 steps, but we need to avoid the unsafe states.\n\nSuppose we go straight up: all actions U.\n\nThen:\n\nAt k=0: y=2 (safe)\n\nAction a_0 = U, then at k=1, y=3\n\nAt k=1: position y=3, freeway y=3, which is safe always.\n\nAction a_1 = U, at k=2, y=4\n\nk=2: y=4, safe\n\na_2 = U, at k=3, y=5\n\nk=3: y=5, safe (y=5 always safe)\n\na_3 = U, at k=4, y=6\n\nNow at k=4, y=6.\n\nΔt=4 for T=t_1+4.\n\nBut y=6 unsafe only at Δt=3, which is k=3.\n\nAt k=4, Δt=4, y=6 is safe, since only unsafe at k=3.\n\nFreeway y=6 unsafe only when Δt=3, so at time k=3, if on y=6.\n\nBut in this path, at k=3, we are on y=5, not y=6.\n\nAt k=4, y=6, Δt=4, which is safe for y=6.\n\nThen action a_4 = U, at k=5, y=7\n\nAt k=5, y=7, Δt=5.\n\nNow y=7 unsafe only for Δt=1 and 2, i.e., k=1 and 2.\n\nAt k=5, Δt=5>2, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, action a_5 = U, at k=6, y=8\n\nk=6, y=8, Δt=6>2, safe.\n\nThen a_6 = U, at k=7, y=9, reached.\n\nSo with H=7 actions, we reach y=9 at k=7.\n\nAnd no collision: let's verify each step.\n\nk=0: at y=2, Δt=0, freeway y=2: span [1+0,12+0]=[1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction U: to y=3 at k=1.\n\nk=1: y=3, Δt=1, freeway y=3: same as y=2, [1+12*1,12+12*1]=[13,24], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction U: to y=4 at k=2.\n\nk=2: y=4, Δt=2, [1+24,12+24]=[25,36], safe.\n\nAction U: to y=5 at k=3.\n\nk=3: y=5, Δt=3, [1+36,12+36]=[37,48], safe.\n\nAction U: to y=6 at k=4.\n\nk=4: y=6, Δt=4.\n\nFreeway y=6: two cars.\n\nFirst car: [1+12*4,12+12*4]=[1+48,12+48]=[49,60], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [ -47 +12*4, -36 +12*4] = [-47+48, -36+48] = [1,12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nAction U: to y=7 at k=5.\n\nk=5: y=7, Δt=5.\n\nFreeway y=7: cars\n\nFirst: [-17+6*5, -6+6*5] = [-17+30, -6+30] = [13,24], 0 not in.\n\nSecond: [31+30,42+30]=[61,72], safe.\n\nAction U: to y=8 at k=6.\n\nk=6: y=8, Δt=6.\n\nSimilar to y=7: first car [-17+36, -6+36]=[19,30], safe.\n\nSecond car [31+36,42+36]=[67,78], safe.\n\nAction U: to y=9 at k=7.\n\ny=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nSo we reached in 7 turns with all U actions.\n\nBut is there a problem? Earlier I thought y=7 and y=8 unsafe at k=1,2, but in this path we are there at k=5 and 6, which are fine.\n\ny=6 unsafe at k=3, but we are at y=6 at k=4, not k=3.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut the question is to output the actions for turn t_1 and onwards.\n\nt_1=85.\n\nActions: from t_1 to t_1+6.\n\nSequence: a_{85} to a_{90}, and at t_1+7=92, position y=9.\n\nH=7 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to H-1, so actions at t_1 + t for t=0 to 6.\n\nNow, but let me confirm if at any point we might be at unsafe state.\n\nk=0: t=85, y=2, safe\n\na_{85} = U\n\nk=1: t=86, y=3, safe (since y=3 always safe)\n\na_{86} = U? Actions are at turn, so at turn t, action a_t.\n\nAt turn 85, position y=2, action a_{85}\n\nAfter action, at turn 86, position y=3.\n\nThen at turn 86, we are at y=3, which is safe, then action a_{86} = U, to y=4 at turn 87.\n\nAt turn 87, y=4, safe, a_{87}=U to y=5 at 88.\n\nAt turn 88, y=5, safe, a_{88}=U to y=6 at 89.\n\nTurn 89: y=6, which is safe, as Δt=4 for t_1=85, T=89, Δt=4, safe as above.\n\na_{89}=U to y=7 at 90.\n\nTurn 90: y=7, Δt=5, safe.\n\na_{90}=U to y=8 at 91.\n\nTurn 91: y=8, Δt=6, safe.\n\na_{91}=U to y=9 at 92.\n\nReached at turn 92.\n\nNow, H=7, from t=0 to 6, actions at t_1 to t_1+6.\n\nBut in the sequence, we need to list actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1? Let's see the answer format.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, so for H=7, t=0 to 6, actions at 85 to 90? t_1 + t for t=0:85, t=1:86, ..., t=6:91.\n\nt from 0 to 6, that's 7 actions: 85,86,87,88,89,90,91.\n\nAfter that, at turn 92, position y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, last action at 91, to reach at 92.\n\nNow, but is there a shorter path? H=7 is minimum since 7 steps up.\n\nCould we go faster? No, because we need to increase y by 7.\n\nUnless we can skip, but no, each step only change by 1.\n\nSo H=7 is minimum.\n\nBut in this case, with all U, it works.\n\nBut let me check if at any point, for example, at turn 88, when we go to y=6.\n\nt_1=85, T=88, Δt=3.\n\nAt turn 88, if we were on y=6, it would be unsafe, but in the path, at turn 88, we are on y=5.\n\nAt turn 88: after action at 87, position at 88 is y=5.\n\nAction at 87 is U, from y=4 to y=5 at turn 88.\n\nThen at turn 88, position y=5, safe.\n\nThen action at 88: U, to y=6 at turn 89.\n\nAt turn 89, y=6, Δt=4, safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nPerhaps we can start with S or something, but that would only delay, increase H, so not better.\n\nGo down to y=1, but y=1 has unsafe times later, but since we are going up, not necessary.\n\nSo all U should work.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 6, there is a car at (-36,-47,right,12) which is unsafe at Δt=3.\n\nBut at Δt=4, it is at [ -47+48, -36+48] = [1,12], not including 0.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nAnother thing: at turn t_1, player is at (0,2), and we need to reach (0,9), but the x-position is always 0, I think, since only moving vertically? The player is on x=0, and cars are on the freeways, moving horizontally, but we only care when x=0 is in their span.\n\nIn this case, all seems fine.\n\nBut let me confirm freeway 6 at other times.\n\nFor example, at Δt=0, t_1, freeway 6: first car [1,12], second car [-47,-36], 0 not in.\n\nΔt=1: [1+12,12+12]=[13,24], [-47+12,-36+12]=[-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nΔt=2: [25,36], [-23,-12], no.\n\nΔt=3: [37,48], [-11,0]? [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0], so [ -11, 0 ], and 0 is included, since 0 <=0.\n\nYes, so at k=3, if on y=6, collision.\n\nBut in our path, we are not on y=6 at k=3.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at k=1: Δt=1, span [-17+6, -6+6] = [-11,0], 0 in, unsafe.\n\nBut we are on y=7 at k=5, not k=1.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 7, with all actions U.\n\nNow, the sequence:\n\nTurn 85: a_{85} = U\n\nTurn 86: a_{86} = U\n\nTurn 87: a_{87} = U\n\nTurn 88: a_{88} = U\n\nTurn 89: a_{89} = U\n\nTurn 90: a_{90} = U\n\nTurn 91: a_{91} = U\n\nAnd at turn 92, position (0,9).\n\nIn the answer, we need to list the actions from t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nH=7, so actions at 85 to 91.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me make sure about the starting point.\n\nAt turn t_1=85, position is (0,2), and we take action a_{85}, which affects position at turn 86.\n\nIn the sequence, we list the actions.\n\nPerhaps I should write it.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", but in the answer format, it seems to list the actions.\n\nIn the box, it should be the sequence.\n\nBut H is also to be found, but in the format, it lists the actions with turns.\n\nPerhaps H is implied.\n\nNow, but in the car state, for freeway 6, at Δt=3, unsafe, but we avoided.\n\nIs there a reason to do something else? For example, if we were to be on y=6 at k=3, we need to avoid, but in this case, not necessary.\n\nSuppose we start with S at first, but that would keep us at y=2 longer, then we need more steps, H>7, worse.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down to y=1, but y=1 is unsafe at later times, and we need to come back, so more steps.\n\nFor example, at k=0, if we do D, to y=1 at k=1, but at k=1, Δt=1, y=1: freeway y=1, at Δt=1, span [ -38+3, -27+3] = [-35,-24], 0 not in, so safe, but then we are at y=1, and need to go up to 9, which takes more steps, and later y=1 unsafe at k=9-12, but we might be gone by then, but still, more than 7 steps.\n\nFor example, from y=1 to y=9, 8 steps, H=8>7.\n\nSo worse.\n\nSimilarly, other paths not better.\n\nTherefore, all U is optimal.\n\nBut in freeway 7 and 8, unsafe at k=1,2, but we are there later, fine.\n\nOne thing: at turn t_1, we are at y=2, safe.\n\nAction U to y=3 at next turn.\n\nIn the sequence, all U.\n\nBut let me write the actions.\n\nSo for turn 85: U\n\nTurn 86: U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 91: U\n\nWith 7 actions.\n\nBut turn 91 is t_1 + 6, since t_1=85, 85 to 91 is 7 turns: 85,86,87,88,89,90,91.\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to 6.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nBut the problem says \"reach (0,9)\", and we do at turn 92.\n\nNow, I think that's fine.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check if at any point, when we move, the collision rule.\n\nFor example, when we move from y=2 to y=3 at turn 86.\n\nAt turn 86, we are on y=3, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, from y=5 to y=6 at turn 89.\n\nAt turn 89, on y=6, which is safe.\n\nThe note: if you decide to move to different y at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, only at T+1.\n\nBut in this case, when we take action at T, we change to new y at T+1, so at turn T, we are on y_T, and we check collision based on y_T and cars on that freeway at turn T.\n\nWe don't check the new freeway until turn T+1.\n\nIn this path, no issue.\n\nSuppose we were to go to y=7 at k=1, but at k=1, y=7 is unsafe, so we cannot be on y=7 at turn t_1+1.\n\nBut in our path, we are not.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 7, with all actions U.\n\nNow, output.\n\nAnswer should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 85: U\nTurn 86: U\nTurn 87: U\nTurn 88: U\nTurn 89: U\nTurn 90: U\nTurn 91: U\n}\n\nBut in the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so yes.\n\nAnd H=7, but not explicitly in the box, I think the sequence implies H.\n\nThe problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", but in the answer format, only the sequence is boxed, so probably H is clear from context.\n\nPerhaps we need to state H, but I think listing the turns shows H.\n\nIn the sequence, from t=0 to H-1, with H actions.\n\nSo for H=7, 7 actions.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nBut let me confirm the car on freeway 1, but we never go there, so irrelevant.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 2) at turn 85 and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\n### Analysis of Car Positions and Safe Freeways\n- **Freeways y=2, y=3, y=4, y=5**: Always safe, as the car spans (for the given car states) never include x=0 at any turn.\n- **Freeway y=1**: Unsafe at turns where Δt = T - 85 is 9, 10, 11, or 12 (i.e., turns 94 to 97), but since the player is moving upward from y=2, this is not relevant.\n- **Freeway y=6**: Unsafe only at Δt = 3 (turn 88) due to the second car (-36, -47, right, 12) having a span that includes x=0.\n- **Freeway y=7**: Unsafe at Δt = 1 and 2 (turns 86 and 87) due to the first car (-6, -17, right, 6) having a span that includes x=0.\n- **Freeway y=8**: Unsafe at Δt = 1 and 2 (turns 86 and 87) due to the first car (-6, -17, right, 6) having a span that includes x=0.\n- **y=0 and y=9**: No freeways, so always safe.\n\n### Path to (0, 9) with Minimal Turns\nThe minimal number of turns required to move from y=2 to y=9 is 7, as each action changes y by at most ±1. A sequence of \"U\" (up) actions achieves this without collisions:\n- At turn 85, start at y=2 (safe).\n- Action \"U\" moves to y=3 at turn 86.\n- At turn 86, y=3 is safe (freeway y=3 always safe).\n- Action \"U\" moves to y=4 at turn 87.\n- At turn 87, y=4 is safe (freeway y=4 always safe).\n- Action \"U\" moves to y=5 at turn 88.\n- At turn 88, y=5 is safe (freeway y=5 always safe).\n- Action \"U\" moves to y=6 at turn 89.\n- At turn 89, y=6 is safe (Δt=4, freeway y=6 safe as x=0 not in car spans).\n- Action \"U\" moves to y=7 at turn 90.\n- At turn 90, y=7 is safe (Δt=5, freeway y=7 safe as x=0 not in car spans).\n- Action \"U\" moves to y=8 at turn 91.\n- At turn 91, y=8 is safe (Δt=6, freeway y=8 safe as x=0 not in car spans).\n- Action \"U\" moves to y=9 at turn 92 (goal reached).\n\nThis path avoids all unsafe states:\n- y=6 is not occupied at turn 88 (unsafe Δt=3), but at turn 89 (safe Δt=4).\n- y=7 and y=8 are not occupied at turns 86 or 87 (unsafe Δt=1 and 2), but at turns 90 and 91 (safe Δt=5 and 6).\n\nNo shorter path exists, as moving from y=2 to y=9 requires at least 7 upward moves. Deviations (e.g., \"S\" or \"D\" actions) would increase H beyond 7.\n\n### Minimal H and Action Sequence\n- Minimal number of turns: \\( H = 7 \\)\n- Action sequence for turns 85 to 91 (i.e., \\( \\{a_{t}\\}_{t=85}^{91} \\)):\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 85: U\nTurn 86: U\nTurn 87: U\nTurn 88: U\nTurn 89: U\nTurn 90: U\nTurn 91: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 87, and the player is at (0,4). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U: y+1), down (D: y-1), or stay (S: y unchanged). The y-coordinate is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and at that turn T, the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player). Note that the player is on freeway y at turn T if they are at y at the end of turn T (i.e., after the action). However, note the important note: if at turn T you move to a new freeway (so y_{T+1} != y_T), then at turn T you are still on the old freeway (y_T) and not yet on the new one (y_{T+1}). Therefore, we only check the freeway corresponding to the current y at the end of the turn.\n\nWe are given the state of the cars at turn t1 (87). For each freeway (1 to 8) we have a list of cars. Each car is defined by (head, tail, direction, speed). Note that for left-moving cars, the head is the leftmost and tail the rightmost? But the update rule says:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → at T: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n- Right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → at T: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nActually, the representation for right-moving is given as (head, tail, direction, speed) and the example for right-moving says: Span(t1)=[τ, h] meaning the tail is the leftmost and head the rightmost? But in the input, we see for freeway 1: (-21, -32, right, 3). \n\nLet me interpret:\n\nFor a right-moving car, the car moves to the right. At time t1, the car's head (front) is at h and tail at τ. Since it's moving right, the head should be the rightmost? But the update rule for right says: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] meaning that τ is the starting point (left end) and h is the ending point (right end). So in the input, for a right-moving car, the first number is the head (which is the right end) and the second is the tail (the left end). But wait, the update rule says: at t1 the span is [τ, h] meaning from τ (left) to h (right). So in the input, the head is h (the right end) and tail is τ (the left end). Similarly, for left-moving, we have (h, τ, left, s) and the span is [h, τ] meaning h is left and τ is right? But the update rule for left: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)] so h is the left end and τ is the right end.\n\nBut in the input, we don't have any left-moving car. All cars in the given state are right-moving.\n\nSo for a right-moving car, the car at time t1 has:\n  left end = tail (τ)\n  right end = head (h)\n\nand at time T (>= t1), the car will be at:\n  left end = τ + s*(T - t1)\n  right end = h + s*(T - t1)\n\nCollision at turn T on freeway k happens if the player is on freeway k at turn T (i.e., after the action at turn T, the y-coordinate is k) and the car on that freeway has a span that covers 0 at that exact turn T.\n\nNote: there can be multiple cars on a freeway. We must check all cars on the freeway we are on at turn T.\n\nOur plan: we are at turn 87 at y=4. We need to get to y=9. The minimal number of turns in terms of vertical movement is 5 (if we go up every turn). But we must avoid the freeways at the turns we are on them.\n\nWe can also move down or stay to avoid collisions, but we want minimal H.\n\nWe are going to simulate the moves. Since we want minimal H, we try to go up as much as possible. However, we must check for collisions.\n\nWe are going to compute the positions of the cars at any future turn T (relative to t1: T = t1 + t, where t>=0).\n\nLet t = T - t1. Then for a car on a freeway at time T, we can compute its span.\n\nWe are going to traverse from y=4 to y=9. The moves are:\n\nAt each turn, we can choose U, D, or S. We want to minimize H, so we prefer U. But if going up would lead to a collision, we might have to wait (S) or even go down (D) to avoid.\n\nHowever, note that we start at y=4 at turn 87 (t=0). We are not on any freeway that we must avoid? Actually, freeways are y=1..8. We are at y=4, so at turn 87, we are on freeway 4. We must check if at turn 87, there is a car on freeway 4 that covers 0.\n\nBut the car state for freeway 4 is: (36,25,right,12). This is a right-moving car. At turn 87 (t=0), the car's left end = τ = 25, right end = h = 36? But wait, the input says (head, tail) = (36,25) and direction right. So the span at t1=87 is [25, 36] (because for right-moving, the span is [tail, head] = [25,36]). Does 0 lie in [25,36]? No. So safe at turn 87.\n\nNow, we plan the moves for t=0 (turn87), t=1 (turn88), ... until we get to y=9.\n\nWe'll simulate step by step. We start at y=4 at turn87.\n\nWe want to get to y=9. The minimal moves would be 5 consecutive Ups. But we must check each freeway we step on at each turn.\n\nWe note that we are at:\n\nTurn T (absolute) = 87 + t, where t is the number of steps from the start.\n\nAt each turn, after taking an action, we are at a new y. Then we check the freeway at that y at turn T (which is 87+t).\n\nWe need to check for each freeway we are on at each turn T.\n\nLet's list the freeways we will be on if we go straight up:\n\nTurn87 (t=0): y=4 -> check freeway4 at turn87: [25,36] -> safe (0 not in [25,36])\nTurn88 (t=1): y=5 -> check freeway5 at turn88: \n  freeway5 has car: (36,25,right,12) -> same as freeway4? \n  At t=1: left end = 25 + 12*1 = 37, right end = 36+12*1 = 48 -> [37,48] -> 0 not in [37,48] -> safe.\nTurn89 (t=2): y=6 -> check freeway6 at turn89: \n  freeway6 has two cars: (36,25,right,12) and (-12,-23,right,12)\n  For first car: [25+12*2=49, 36+12*2=60] -> [49,60] -> safe.\n  For second car: (-12,-23,right,12) -> at t1, span = [-23, -12] (because tail=-23, head=-12). \n      At t=2: left end = -23 + 12*2 = -23+24=1, right end = -12+12*2=12 -> [1,12] -> 0 is not in [1,12]? 0 is less than 1 -> safe.\nTurn90 (t=3): y=7 -> check freeway7 at turn90:\n  freeway7 has two cars: (6,-5,right,6) and (54,43,right,6)\n  First car: at t1, span = [-5,6] (because tail=-5, head=6). \n      At t=3: left end = -5 + 6*3 = -5+18=13, right end=6+18=24 -> [13,24] -> safe.\n  Second car: [43,54] at t1, then at t=3: 43+18=61, 54+18=72 -> [61,72] -> safe.\nTurn91 (t=4): y=8 -> check freeway8 at turn91:\n  freeway8 has two cars: (6,-5,right,6) and (54,43,right,6) -> same as freeway7?\n  First car: at t=4: left end = -5 + 6*4 = -5+24=19, right end=6+24=30 -> [19,30] -> safe.\n  Second car: 43+24=67, 54+24=78 -> [67,78] -> safe.\nTurn92 (t=5): y=9 -> we are at the goal. Note: freeways are only from 1 to 8, so at y=9 we don't check any car. Safe.\n\nSo if we do U, U, U, U, U in 5 turns, we are safe? Then minimal H is 5.\n\nBut wait, at turn87 we are already at y=4 and we take an action to move to y=5 at turn88? Actually, we are at turn87: we start at (0,4). We take an action at turn87 to move to the next y at turn88? \n\nThe player update: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo at turn87 (t1=87), we are at y_87 = 4. Then we choose an action a_87. Then at the next turn (turn88), the position is y_88 = y_87 + Δy_87.\n\nTherefore, at the moment we are at turn87, we are at y=4. We have to take an action at turn87 to move to the next state at turn88.\n\nBut note: at turn87, we are already at freeway4. We must check that we are safe at turn87. We did: freeway4 at turn87: car [25,36] -> safe.\n\nThen we take action at turn87: we want to move to y=5 at turn88. Then at turn88, we are at freeway5 and we must check freeway5 at turn88.\n\nWe did the checks above and all were safe.\n\nSo the sequence would be:\n\nTurn 87: U -> to y=5 at turn88\nTurn 88: U -> to y=6 at turn89\nTurn 89: U -> to y=7 at turn90\nTurn 90: U -> to y=8 at turn91\nTurn 91: U -> to y=9 at turn92\n\nBut wait, at turn91 we are at y=8? Then after the last U at turn91, we become y=9 at turn92. So we are at y=9 at turn92. That means we have taken 5 actions: from turn87 to turn91 (inclusive) and then at turn92 we are at the goal. So H=5? The number of turns we take actions is 5, and then we are done at the next state.\n\nBut the problem says: we are at turn t1 (87) and we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ... until we reach (0,9). We must output the actions for t1 to t1+H-1, and then at the end of the last action we are at (0,9). So H is the number of actions.\n\nIn the above, we take 5 actions: at turns 87,88,89,90,91. Then at turn92, we are at (0,9). So H=5.\n\nBut is there a problem? We must check that at each turn when we are on a freeway (which we are from y=4 to y=8) we are safe. We did:\n\n- Turn87: at y=4 -> freeway4: [25,36] -> safe.\n- Turn88: at y=5 -> freeway5: [37,48] -> safe.\n- Turn89: at y=6 -> freeway6: two cars: [49,60] and [1,12] -> safe (0 not in either).\n- Turn90: at y=7 -> freeway7: [13,24] and [61,72] -> safe.\n- Turn91: at y=8 -> freeway8: [19,30] and [67,78] -> safe.\n\nSo it seems safe.\n\nBut wait: at turn89 (t=2) for freeway6, the second car: we computed [1,12]. But note: the car was (-12,-23,right,12). \n  At t1=87, the car is at: tail=-23, head=-12 -> span [-23,-12]. \n  At t=2 (turn89): the car moves right by 12*2=24 units: so new left end = -23+24=1, new right end=-12+24=12. So [1,12]. \n  The player is at x=0, which is not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, all others.\n\nBut note: at turn89, we are at y=6. The freeway6 has two cars. The second car at turn89 is at [1,12]. But the player is at (0,6) at turn89? Actually, the player is at (0,6) at the end of turn89. So we check the cars on freeway6 at turn89. The second car is at [1,12] which does not include 0 -> safe.\n\nBut what if we had to be at turn89 at (0,6) and the car was [0,12]? Then it would be a collision. But in our case, it's [1,12] so safe.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn 87: U\nTurn 88: U\nTurn 89: U\nTurn 90: U\nTurn 91: U\n\nBut wait, we have 5 actions. However, at the end of the last action (turn91) we are at y=8? Then we take action U at turn91 and become y=9 at turn92. Then we are done at turn92. So we have taken 5 actions.\n\nBut the problem says: we are at (0,4) at turn87. Then we take an action at turn87 and then we are at y=5 at turn88. Then at turn88 we take an action to go to y=6 at turn89, and so on until turn91 we take an action to go to y=9 at turn92. Then we stop because we reached (0,9).\n\nSo the minimal H is 5.\n\nBut let me double-check the freeway6 at turn89: t=2 (from t1=87). The car (-12,-23,right,12) becomes at turn89: \n  left = -23 + 12*2 = -23+24=1\n  right = -12 + 24 = 12\n  so [1,12] -> 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nBut what if we consider the car at freeway6: (36,25,right,12) at turn89: \n  left = 25+24=49, right=36+24=60 -> [49,60] -> safe.\n\nSo both cars are safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway7 at turn90: t=3\n  First car: (6,-5,right,6) -> at t1: [-5,6] -> at t=3: left=-5+18=13, right=6+18=24 -> [13,24]\n  Second car: (54,43,right,6) -> [43,54] -> at t=3: 43+18=61, 54+18=72 -> [61,72] -> safe.\n\nFreeway8 at turn91: t=4\n  First car: [-5,6] -> left=-5+24=19, right=6+24=30 -> [19,30]\n  Second car: [43,54] -> 43+24=67, 54+24=78 -> [67,78] -> safe.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of 5 Ups is safe.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y = 1, ..., 8\". We are never on freeways 1,2,3? We started at y=4 and went to 5,6,7,8, then to 9. So we were on freeways 4,5,6,7,8. And we checked them.\n\nIs there any other constraint? The note says: if you move to a new freeway at turn T, then at turn T you are not on the new freeway. But in our moves:\n\nAt turn87: we start at y=4. Then we take U: so at turn88 we are at y=5. During turn87, we are at y=4 (so we check freeway4 at turn87). Then at turn88, we are at y=5 (so we check freeway5 at turn88). This matches.\n\nBut note: we are at y=4 at turn87, and we are safe. Then we move to y=5 at turn88 and then we check freeway5 at turn88. That is correct.\n\nSo the answer should be 5 Ups.\n\nBut let me check the initial state again for freeway6: it has two cars. The second car is (-12,-23,right,12). At turn87 (t=0): the car is at [-23,-12]. At turn88 (t=1): [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0]. Oh wait! At turn88, the car is at [-11,0]. This means at turn88, the car covers 0? So if we were on freeway6 at turn88, we would be in collision.\n\nBut in our plan, we are on freeway6 at turn89, not turn88.\n\nAt turn88, we are at freeway5. Then at turn89, we are at freeway6.\n\nBut what about if we had to go through freeway6 earlier? We don't. We are at freeway6 only at turn89.\n\nNow, what if we consider if we had taken a different path? But we are going straight up and it works.\n\nBut wait, let me check freeway6 at turn88 (t=1) for the second car: [-23+12*1, -12+12*1] = [-11,0]. So the car covers 0 at turn88. But we are not on freeway6 at turn88, we are at freeway5. So safe.\n\nAt turn89 (t=2): [1,12] -> doesn't cover 0.\n\nSo our plan is safe.\n\nBut what about freeway7 and freeway8? \n\nAt turn89 (t=2) for freeway7: \n  First car: (6,-5,right,6) -> at t1: [-5,6] -> at t=2: [-5+12, 6+12] = [7,18] -> does not cover 0.\n  Second car: (54,43,right,6) -> [43+12,54+12]=[55,66] -> safe.\n\nAt turn90 (t=3): we are at freeway7: [13,24] and [61,72] -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway8 at turn90 (t=3): \n  First car: [-5+18, 6+18] = [13,24]\n  Second car: [43+18,54+18]=[61,72] -> safe.\n\nAt turn91 (t=4): [19,30] and [67,78] -> safe.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of 5 Ups is safe.\n\nBut note: we must output the actions for turns 87 to 91 (5 actions).\n\nAnswer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 87: U\nTurn 88: U\nTurn 89: U\nTurn 90: U\nTurn 91: U\n}\n\nBut wait, the absolute turn numbers: \nTurn 87: U -> to y=5 at turn88\nTurn 88: U -> to y=6 at turn89\nTurn 89: U -> to y=7 at turn90\nTurn 90: U -> to y=8 at turn91\nTurn 91: U -> to y=9 at turn92\n\nSo we are at (0,9) at turn92, which is after 5 actions.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t from 0 to H-1. So H=5, then t=0,1,2,3,4 -> turns 87,88,89,90,91.\n\nYes.\n\nBut is there a possibility that we can do it in fewer than 5? We start at y=4 and need to go to y=9: that requires 5 steps up. So no.\n\nTherefore, this is minimal.\n\nBut what if we could skip some freeways by moving faster? We cannot: we can only change by at most 1 per turn.\n\nSo the answer is the sequence of 5 Ups.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". We have H=5.\n\nBut let me re-check the freeway6 at turn89 (t=2) again: the second car: \n  Initial: head=-12, tail=-23, right-moving.\n  At turn89: tail = -23 + 12*2 = -23+24=1, head=-12+24=12 -> [1,12]. \n  The player is at (0,6) at turn89 -> not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nBut wait: the update rule for right-moving: \n  Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo [1,12] is correct.\n\nBut what if the car was moving and at turn89, the car is from 1 to 12? Then 0 is not included.\n\nTherefore, we are safe.\n\nBut note: there is another car on freeway6: (36,25,right,12) -> at turn89: [25+24,36+24]=[49,60] -> safe.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nSimilarly, all others.\n\nBut wait, freeway7 at turn90: \n  The first car: (6,-5,right,6) -> at t1=87: tail=-5, head=6 -> span [-5,6]. \n  At turn90 (t=3): [-5+6*3, 6+6*3] = [-5+18, 6+18] = [13,24] -> safe.\n\nBut note: the input for freeway7: \n  (6, -5, right, 6) -> so head=6, tail=-5 -> that means the car spans from -5 to 6? But that's a length of 11? And it's moving right.

The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nThe car update rules:\n- For a car moving right: at time T, the span is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n- For a car moving left: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]  (but note: the problem states left-moving as having head h and tail tau, and then updates as [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]; however, in our data all cars are right-moving except we must note the representation.)\n\nLooking at the car state:\n\nFreeway 1: (-18, -29, right, 3) -> right moving, so at time T, the span is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] = [-29 + 3*(T-88), -18 + 3*(T-88)]\n\nFreeway 2,3,4,5: (48,37,right,12) -> [37 + 12*(T-88), 48 + 12*(T-88)]\n\nFreeway 6: two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12) \n   First: [37+12*(T-88), 48+12*(T-88)]\n   Second: [-11+12*(T-88), 0+12*(T-88)]\n\nFreeway 7 and 8: two cars each: (12,1,right,6) and (60,49,right,6)\n   First: [1+6*(T-88), 12+6*(T-88)]\n   Second: [49+6*(T-88), 60+6*(T-88)]\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y (which is the row, and note the player is moving vertically) and at that turn T, the player's x-coordinate is 0 and 0 is in the span of any car on freeway y at turn T.\n\nImportant note: The player is at (0, y_t) at turn t. The movement in the vertical direction (changing freeway) happens at the next turn. Specifically:\n- At turn T, the player is at freeway y_T.\n- The action taken at turn T (a_T) determines y_{T+1}.\n- When the player moves from freeway y_T to y_{T+1} at the end of turn T, then at turn T+1 they are on freeway y_{T+1}. Therefore, at turn T, the player is only present on freeway y_T.\n\nThus, at turn T, we only check the cars on freeway y_T for collision. And the condition is: if 0 is in the span of any car on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nWe start at turn 88 at (0,5). We must avoid freeways 1-8 when we are on that freeway at a given turn.\n\nGoal: reach (0,9). Note that 9 is the top, and there are no cars above freeway 8 (since freeways are 1-8). So when we are at freeway 9, we are safe.\n\nWe can only move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The vertical position is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and the sequence of actions from turn 88 to turn 88+H-1 such that at the last turn (turn 88+H-1) we are at y=9.\n\nLet T = t - 88, so at T=0, we are at y=5.\n\nWe need to simulate the movement and check for collisions on the freeways we are on at each turn.\n\nWe note that we start at freeway 5 at T=0 (turn 88).\n\nWe must avoid:\n\nFreeway 1: [-29 + 3*T, -18 + 3*T]  (since T is relative to 88, so T = t - 88)\n\nWe need to check at each turn T (starting at T=0) for the freeway we are on:\n\nCollision if 0 is in the car span on that freeway at that T.\n\nWe are to minimize H (the number of turns from start until we are at 9).\n\nWe can use BFS (breadth-first search) over states (turn T, position y) to find the minimal steps to y=9.\n\nBut note: the state must also account for the time because the car positions change with time.\n\nHowever, note that the car positions are linear in T (the time from t1). So we can compute for any T the car spans.\n\nWe are only concerned with the freeway we are on at time T (which is turn t1 + T) and whether 0 is in the car span on that freeway at that exact T.\n\nWe start at T=0, y=5.\n\nWe wish to reach y=9 at some T (which will be H-1 because we start at T=0 and do H actions, so the last state is at T=H-1).\n\nWe can consider the moves: U, D, S. And we have constraints:\n\n- y must be in [0,9]\n- We must not have collision at the current T on the current y.\n\nWe can do a BFS in terms of (T, y). But note T can be large? However, we are going from 5 to 9 and we can only move at most 1 per turn, so the minimal H without cars would be 4 (if we go up each time). But with cars, we might have to wait or detour.\n\nWe must compute the car positions for each freeway at each T we might be at.\n\nSince the minimal H is at least 4, and we might have to wait, H might be more. But we don't know the maximum T we need to consider. However, note the car movements: they are linear and periodic? Actually, the spans are intervals moving at constant speed. The collision condition for a fixed freeway and fixed T is a simple interval check.\n\nWe can simulate for T=0,1,2,... until we find a path to y=9.\n\nWe note that we can only move one step at a time, so the state space is manageable.\n\nLet me precompute for each freeway and for T from 0 to, say, 20 (because minimal is 4, and if we have to wait, we might need up to 20? Let's see the car patterns) the times when the freeway is blocked (i.e., 0 is in some car span).\n\nBut note: we are only at a freeway at one specific T. So we can compute for each freeway and each T whether it is safe.\n\nWe'll define a function safe(y, T) that returns True if at time T (relative to start) the freeway y is safe (i.e., no car on freeway y has a span that contains 0 at time T).\n\nBut note: freeway 9 has no cars, so safe(9, T) is always True.\n\nAlso, freeway 0: the problem doesn't mention freeway 0? The player starts at y=5 and can go to y=0. The problem says vertical axis y=0,1,...,9. And the freeways with cars are y=1,...,8. So freeway 0 is safe? But the problem says avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8. So freeway 0 and 9 are safe.\n\nTherefore, we only need to worry about freeways 1 to 8.\n\nNow, let's compute the blocking intervals for each freeway. But note: for a given freeway and T, we can compute the car spans and check if 0 is in any.\n\nFreeway 1: \n   Car: right, h=-18, tau=-29, s=3 -> span at T: [ -29 + 3*T, -18 + 3*T ]\n   We need 0 in [ -29+3T, -18+3T ]?\n   => -29+3T <= 0 <= -18+3T\n   => 3T <= 29 -> T <= 29/3 ≈ 9.66 -> T <= 9\n        and 3T >= 18 -> T >= 6\n   So blocked for T=6,7,8,9.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4,5: \n   Car: (48,37,right,12) -> [37+12T, 48+12T]\n   0 in [37+12T, 48+12T]?\n   => 37+12T <= 0 <= 48+12T -> but 37+12T is positive for T>=0? \n   Since T>=0: 37+12T >=37>0 -> so 0 is always less than the lower bound -> never blocked.\n\nFreeway 6: \n   Two cars:\n   First: (48,37,right,12) -> same as above: [37+12T,48+12T] -> never contains 0 for T>=0.\n   Second: (0,-11,right,12) -> [-11+12T, 0+12T] = [12T-11, 12T]\n   0 in [12T-11, 12T]?\n   => 12T-11 <= 0 <= 12T\n   => 0<=12T -> T>=0 (always true for T>=0) and 12T-11<=0 -> T <= 11/12 -> T<=0.916...\n   So only at T=0: 12*0-11 = -11 <=0<=0 -> true. So blocked at T=0.\n\n   Therefore, freeway 6 is blocked at T=0 only? But wait, at T=0: [12*0-11, 12*0] = [-11,0] -> 0 is the endpoint, so included? Yes.\n\n   For T>=1: 12T-11 >= 12*1-11=1>0 -> so 0 is not in the interval.\n\n   So freeway 6 is blocked only at T=0.\n\nFreeway 7:\n   Two cars:\n   First: (12,1,right,6) -> [1+6T, 12+6T]\n      0 in [1+6T,12+6T]? -> 1+6T>0 for T>=0 -> never.\n   Second: (60,49,right,6) -> [49+6T,60+6T] -> positive for T>=0 -> never.\n\n   So freeway 7 is always safe.\n\nFreeway 8:\n   Same as freeway 7? The table says the same: (12,1,right,6) and (60,49,right,6) -> same as above -> always safe.\n\nWait, the table for freeway 7 and 8 are identical? Yes. So both are always safe.\n\nSummary of blocking:\n\nFreeway 1: blocked at T=6,7,8,9\nFreeway 2: never\nFreeway 3: never\nFreeway 4: never\nFreeway 5: never\nFreeway 6: blocked at T=0 only\nFreeway 7: never\nFreeway 8: never\n\nBut note: we are at T=0 at the start. And we start at freeway 5 -> safe because freeway 5 is never blocked at any T.\n\nBut what about freeway 6? We are not on freeway 6 at T=0, so we don't care.\n\nNow, we are at y=5 at T=0. We can take actions: U, D, S.\n\nGoal: get to y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nMinimal moves: 4 ups.\n\nBut we must avoid:\n\n- If we go up to y=6 at T=1? How?\n\nAt T=0: we are at y=5 -> safe.\n\nAfter an action at T=0, we move to the next state at T=1.\n\nThe next state at T=1: we will be at a new y. The action a_88 (which is at T=0) determines y at T=1.\n\nWe need to check the freeway we are on at each T.\n\nWe'll simulate:\n\nState: (T, y) and we record the path.\n\nWe start at (0,5). We wish to reach (T,9) for some T.\n\nWe consider moves: U, D, S.\n\nConstraints:\n- The next state (T+1, y') must have y' in [0,9].\n- The next state must be safe: at time T+1, the freeway y' must be safe.\n\nNote: at time T we are at y, and we take an action that changes y to y' at time T+1. Therefore, at time T we are only at y (and we already checked that at T, y is safe). Then at time T+1, we are at y' and we must check that at T+1, freeway y' is safe.\n\nBut note: the initial state at T=0: we are at y=5, and we have checked that freeway5 is safe at T=0.\n\nThen we take an action at T=0 and move to T=1 at y1.\n\nWe must check that at T=1, freeway y1 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, then we take an action at T=1 and move to T=2 at y2, and check that at T=2, freeway y2 is safe, and so on.\n\nWe are to minimize the number of turns until we are at y=9. The moment we are at y=9, we stop (and we don't need to check beyond because the goal is reached and we are safe at freeway9).\n\nWe can use BFS:\n\nLet me denote state (T, y). We start at (0,5) with path [].\n\nWe generate:\n- If we do S: then next state (1,5) -> then we must check at T=1, freeway5: safe? (freeway5 is always safe) -> yes.\n- If we do U: then next state (1,6) -> at T=1, freeway6: we know freeway6 is only blocked at T=0, so at T=1 it's safe -> yes.\n- If we do D: then next state (1,4) -> freeway4: always safe.\n\nSo from (0,5) we can go to (1,4), (1,5), (1,6).\n\nWe mark visited states? But note: we can revisit the same y at a later T, and it might be necessary (for example, if we have to wait). But in this case, we don't have any blocking that repeats? Actually, freeway1 blocks at T=6,7,8,9, so we might need to avoid freeway1 at those times.\n\nBut note: we are going upward. The minimal path without waiting would be:\n\nT0: y=5 -> T1: y=6 -> T2: y=7 -> T3: y=8 -> T4: y=9.\n\nCheck each step:\n\nAt T0: at y=5 -> safe (always)\nAt T1: at y=6 -> we must check freeway6 at T1: safe? (since blocked only at T0 -> so safe at T1) -> safe.\nAt T2: at y=7 -> freeway7: always safe -> safe.\nAt T3: at y=8 -> freeway8: always safe -> safe.\nAt T4: at y=9 -> safe.\n\nSo in 4 moves (H=5? Let me count: from T0 to T4, that's 4 moves? Actually, we start at T0 and we do 4 actions: at T0, T1, T2, T3 -> then at T4 we are at y=9.\n\nBut the sequence of actions: \n  Turn88 (T0): action0 -> leads to state at T1 (turn89) at y1\n  Turn89 (T1): action1 -> leads to state at T2 (turn90) at y2\n  Turn90 (T2): action2 -> leads to state at T3 (turn91) at y3\n  Turn91 (T3): action3 -> leads to state at T4 (turn92) at y4\n\nWe require that at turn92 (T4) we are at y=9.\n\nSo we need to be at y=9 at T4.\n\nIn the above plan:\n\nAction0: U -> from y5 to y6 at T1\nAction1: U -> from y6 to y7 at T2\nAction2: U -> from y7 to y8 at T3\nAction3: U -> from y8 to y9 at T4\n\nThis sequence: \n  T0: y5 (safe)\n  T1: y6 (safe because T1 !=0) \n  T2: y7 (safe)\n  T3: y8 (safe)\n  T4: y9 (safe)\n\nSo it works in 4 moves.\n\nBut what if we start by going down? That would take longer. So 4 is minimal.\n\nHowever, note that at T0 we are at y5, and we are going to move to y6 at T1. We are not on freeway6 at T0, so the blockage of freeway6 at T0 doesn't affect us.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 4.\n\nThe sequence of actions: \n  Turn88: U\n  Turn89: U\n  Turn90: U\n  Turn91: U\n\nBut wait, after the last U at turn91, at turn92 we are at y9. The problem says: the sequence of actions from t1 to t1+H-1. Here H is the number of actions? And we do 4 actions: at t1, t1+1, t1+2, t1+3 (which are 88,89,90,91) and then at turn92 (which is t1+4) we are at y9.\n\nBut the definition: we have a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} and then at the turn after the last action (turn t1+H-1 + 1?) we are at the state? Actually, the state at the end of the last action is at turn t1+H-1.\n\nLet me read: \n  We start at turn t1 at position (0, y_{t1}).\n  Then we take an action a_{t1} -> then we are at turn t1+1 at position (0, y_{t1+1}).\n\nSo after H actions, we are at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: we want to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then we are at turn t1+H-1? \n\nLet me check: \n  t=0: a_{t1+0} = a_{t1} -> then at the next turn we are at t1+1.\n  t=1: a_{t1+1} -> then at turn t1+2.\n  ...\n  t=H-1: a_{t1+H-1} -> then at turn t1+H.\n\nSo at turn t1+H, we are at the state after the last action.\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"?\n\nWait, the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nBut according to the update: \n  At turn t1: we are at (0, y_{t1})\n  After action a_{t1}: at turn t1+1, we are at (0, y_{t1+1})\n\nSo to be at (0,9) at a particular turn, say turn T, then T must be t1 + H? \n\nBut the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLooking back: \n  \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\nSo the last state we care about is at turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut in the update: \n  The state at turn t is determined by the action at turn t-1? \n\nActually, the state at turn t1 is given. Then we take an action at turn t1 to get to state at turn t1+1.\n\nBut the problem says we are to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nThat means we do not take an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nLet me re-read the problem:\n\nWe are given the state at turn t1: (0, y_{t1}).\n\nThen we choose actions: a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1} (so H actions) and then the state at turn t1+H-1 is (0,9). \n\nBut how? \n\nThe action at turn t1: determines y_{t1+1}.\nThe action at turn t1+1: determines y_{t1+2}.\n...\nThe action at turn t1+H-1: determines y_{t1+H}.\n\nSo the state at turn t1+H-1 is determined by the action at turn t1+H-2? \n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nI think there might be a misunderstanding.\n\nLooking at the update equation: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + \\Delta y_t\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t. Then we take action a_t, which gives \\Delta y_t, and then we move to y_{t+1} at turn t+1.\n\nTherefore, the state at turn t1 is given: (0, y_{t1}).\n\nAfter we take an action a_{t1} at turn t1, we move to state (0, y_{t1+1}) at turn t1+1.\n\nAfter we take an action a_{t1+1} at turn t1+1, we move to state (0, y_{t1+2}) at turn t1+2.\n\n...\n\nAfter we take an action a_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1, we move to state (0, y_{t1+H}) at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nThat would be the state at turn t1+H-1, which is determined by the action at turn t1+H-2.\n\nBut the sequence of actions is from t1 to t1+H-1, which is H actions, and the last action (a_{t1+H-1}) is taken at turn t1+H-1 and then we are at state at turn t1+H.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\nThis seems contradictory.\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\nSo they want the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 to be (0,9)? \n\nBut the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 is (0, y_{t1+H-1}), which is the state we are at that turn, and then we take an action a_{t1+H-1} to move to the next state.\n\nSo they want y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nHow is that achieved?\n\nThe state at turn t1+H-1 is determined by the previous actions. The last action that affects it is a_{t1+H-2} (taken at turn t1+H-2) which moves us to y_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1.\n\nTherefore, we need to choose actions a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-2} such that we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nBut the sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1, meaning we take H actions: at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nBut the last action (at turn t1+H-1) is taken when we are already at y_{t1+H-1}=9? \n\nThat action would then move us to y_{t1+H} which might be 10? But we cannot go beyond 9.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we take H actions and then at the turn after the last action (i.e., turn t1+H) we are at (0,9). But the problem explicitly says \"at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nLooking at the example in the problem? There is no example.\n\nRe-read the problem: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nIn the update: \n  At turn t1: we are at y_{t1} (given as 5)\n  After action a_{t1}: at turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + \\Delta a_{t1}\n\nSo to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1, we must have:\n\n  y_{t1+H-1} = 9\n\nand this state is reached by the actions taken at turns t1 to t1+H-2.\n\nBut the sequence of actions we output is from t1 to t1+H-1? That would be one extra action.\n\nTherefore, the number of actions is H, but the last action (a_{t1+H-1}) is taken at the turn when we are already at 9? And then we move to y_{t1+H} = 9 + \\Delta a_{t1+H-1}? But we cannot go above 9, so if we are at 9, we can only do S or D. But the goal is to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1, so we don't care about the next state? \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". So if we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1, then we have reached. The action at that turn is taken after we have reached? \n\nThis is ambiguous.\n\nHowever, note that the problem says: \"the minimal number of turns H\". And the sequence of actions has H actions. And we are to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nIn the update: \n  turn t1: state y5\n  turn t1+1: state after first action\n  ...\n  turn t1+H-1: state after action H-1? \n\nBut the state at turn t1+H-1 is the result of the first H-1 actions? \n\nLet me define:\n\nLet the state at turn t1 be s0 = 5.\n\nAfter action0 (at turn t1): s1 = s0 + \\Delta a0 -> at turn t1+1, we are at s1.\nAfter action1 (at turn t1+1): s2 = s1 + \\Delta a1 -> at turn t1+2, we are at s2.\n...\nAfter action_{k} (at turn t1+k): s_{k+1} = s_k + \\Delta a_k -> at turn t1+k+1, we are at s_{k+1}.\n\nWe wish s_{H-1} = 9 at turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut note: at turn t1+H-1, we are at state s_{H-1}. How many actions have we taken? We have taken actions at t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2? That is H-1 actions.\n\nBut the problem says the sequence is {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, which is H actions: t=0 to t=H-1 -> actions at t1+0, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nSo we are taking an extra action.\n\nTherefore, to be at state 9 at turn t1+H-1, we must have:\n\n  After H-1 actions (at turns t1 to t1+H-2) we are at state 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nThen we take an additional action at turn t1+H-1 (the last in the sequence) which moves us to state s_H at turn t1+H. But we don't care about that state? \n\nBut the problem says we only require to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo the minimal H must be the minimal number of turns from the start until we are at 9? \n\nBut note: we start at turn t1, and we are at y5. We wish to be at y9 at some turn T. The minimal T is t1+4? Because we can move up 4 times.\n\nAt turn t1: we are at y5.\nAt turn t1+1: we are at y6 (after first U)\nAt turn t1+2: we are at y7 (after second U)\nAt turn t1+3: we are at y8 (after third U)\nAt turn t1+4: we are at y9 (after fourth U)\n\nSo we are at y9 at turn t1+4.\n\nTherefore, we wish to be at turn t1+H-1 = t1+4 -> so H-1=4 -> H=5.\n\nAnd the sequence of actions has H=5 actions: from t1 to t1+4.\n\nBut what are these actions?\n\nAt turn t1 (88): we take an action to move from y5 to ... we wish to be at y9 at turn t1+4 (which is after 4 moves).\n\nSo the actions:\n\n  Turn88 (t1): a0 -> to y6 at turn89\n  Turn89: a1 -> to y7 at turn90\n  Turn90: a2 -> to y8 at turn91\n  Turn91: a3 -> to y9 at turn92\n  Turn92: a4 -> but we are already at y9 at the beginning of turn92? Then we take an action at turn92? \n\nBut we wish to be at y9 at turn t1+H-1 = 88+5-1 = 92. So at turn92, we are at y9. How did we get there? By the actions at turn88,89,90,91.\n\nThe action at turn92 (a4) is taken after we have reached. \n\nBut the problem says we must output H=5 actions. And the last action is at turn92.\n\nHowever, note that the problem says: \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\", and t1+H-1 = 92. So at the beginning of turn92, we are at (0,9). Then we take action a4 at turn92? But that is after reaching.\n\nThis seems odd.\n\nPerhaps the problem means that we take H actions and then at the turn after the last action we are at the goal? \n\nBut the text explicitly says: at turn t1+H-1.\n\nAlternatively, it might be that the turn count includes the starting turn? \n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence is for turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nIf we consider the entire process from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1, that's H turns? \n\nBut in the sequence, we are outputting actions for H turns? \n\nLet me reexamine the problem statement: \n  \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\nSo the sequence has H actions, and they are for turns t1+0, t1+1, ... , t1+H-1.\n\nAnd the state at turn t1+H-1 is (0,9).\n\nBut how is that state achieved? It is the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action at that turn? \n\nBut the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 is the result of the actions taken at turns t1 to t1+H-2.\n\nTherefore, to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1, we must have reached it by the actions taken at turns t1 to t1+H-2. The action taken at turn t1+H-1 is not used to get to 9 at that turn.\n\nTherefore, the action at turn t1+H-1 can be arbitrary? But we are required to output it.\n\nIn our case, we want to be at 9 at turn t1+4 (which is 88+4=92). Then H-1=4 -> H=5.\n\nAnd the actions are for turns 88,89,90,91,92.\n\nThe first four actions (t88 to t91) should be U to move up to 9 by turn92? \n\nBut at turn92 (t1+4), we are at y9 at the beginning of the turn. Then we take an action at turn92. What action? We don't care as long as we don't crash, but we are at freeway9 -> always safe. We can choose S (stay).\n\nSo the plan:\n\n  Turn88: U -> moves to y6 at turn89\n  Turn89: U -> moves to y7 at turn90\n  Turn90: U -> moves to y8 at turn91\n  Turn91: U -> moves to y9 at turn92\n  Turn92: S -> we are at y9 at the beginning of turn92, and then we stay at y9.\n\nBut then at turn92, we are at freeway9 -> safe.\n\nBut the requirement is to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1 = 88+5-1=92. So at the beginning of turn92, we are at (0,9). Then we take the action at turn92 (which is the fifth action) and then we are at y9 (if we do S) or y8 (if we do D) at turn93. But we don't care about turn93.\n\nSo the minimal H is 5, with 5 actions.\n\nBut is there a way with H=4? \n\nIf H=4, then we wish to be at 9 at turn t1+4-1 = 88+3=91.\n\nSo we need to be at y9 at turn91.\n\nWe start at turn88: y5.\n\nWe have 3 actions: at turn88,89,90.\n\nWe need to go from y5 to y9 in 3 moves: that requires moving up 4 units in 3 moves -> we must move up at least twice and one move we move up two? But we can only move one step per move. So we cannot: maximum we can move is 3 units: 3 ups.\n\nSo we can get to y8 at turn91, not y9.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 5.\n\nBut wait, the goal is to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. With H=5, we are there at turn92.\n\nBut can we be there earlier? \n\nWith H=4: we wish to be at turn t1+4-1=91 at y9.\n\nWe start at turn88: y5.\n\nWe have 3 actions (at turn88,89,90) to get to y9 at turn91.\n\nBut we need 4 moves up. We can only do 3 actions: so we can only move up 3 times -> y8 at turn91.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 5.\n\nBut what about the blocking? \n\nIn our plan for H=5:\n\n  Turn88: action U -> from y5 to y6 at turn89.\n  Turn89: action U -> from y6 to y7 at turn90.\n  Turn90: action U -> from y7 to y8 at turn91.\n  Turn91: action U -> from y8 to y9 at turn92.\n  Turn92: action S.\n\nNow, we must check for collisions at each turn:\n\n  At turn88 (T0): we are at y5 -> freeway5: always safe -> safe.\n  At turn89 (T1): we are at y6 -> freeway6 at T1: safe (only blocked at T0) -> safe.\n  At turn90 (T2): we are at y7 -> freeway7: always safe -> safe.\n  At turn91 (T3): we are at y8 -> freeway8: always safe -> safe.\n  At turn92 (T4): we are at y9 -> safe.\n\nSo no collisions.\n\nBut note: the action at turn92 (S) is taken when we are at y9, and then we stay at y9. And at turn92 we are at freeway9 -> safe.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn88: U\nTurn89: U\nTurn90: U\nTurn91: U\nTurn92: S\n\nBut wait, we have 5 actions and we are at y9 at the beginning of turn92 (which is t1+H-1=88+5-1=92) and then we do S at turn92.\n\nBut the problem says: we are to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1 (which is turn92). So we are there at the beginning of turn92, and then we do the action at turn92. That is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, could we do without the last S? But the problem requires H=5 actions, so we must output 5 actions.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". We found that we need to be at turn92 to be at y9, and that requires H=5.\n\nBut is there a way to be at y9 at an earlier turn? \n\nSuppose we try to be at y9 at turn91 (which would require H=4, since t1+H-1=88+4-1=91).\n\nWe start at turn88: y5.\n\nWe do three actions to get to y9 by turn91.\n\nBut we can only move up 3 times: \n  Turn88: U -> y6 at turn89\n  Turn89: U -> y7 at turn90\n  Turn90: U -> y8 at turn91\n\nWe are at y8 at turn91, not y9.\n\nAlternatively, we might try to move faster? But we cannot: only one step per action.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 5.\n\nBut what if we take a detour? For example, go down and then up? That would take more than 4 moves, so more than 5 actions? Not helpful.\n\nSo the minimal H is 5.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and in the context, H is the number of turns we are considering? And the sequence has H actions.\n\nWe found that we need 5 actions to be at turn92 at y9.\n\nBut is there a path that uses 5 actions but reaches earlier? No, because the earliest we can be at y9 is turn92.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nTurn88: U\nTurn89: U\nTurn90: U\nTurn91: U\nTurn92: S\n\nBut why S at the end? We could do U again? But if we do U at turn92, we are at y10? which is not allowed. So we must do S or D. But we want to avoid crashing? At freeway9 there are no cars, so we can do anything? But D would move us to y8 at turn93, which is not the goal. But the goal is only to be at y9 at turn92. After that, we don't care. But we must output the actions for the entire sequence of H=5 actions.\n\nWe can do S at the last action to stay.\n\nAlternatively, we could do D at the last action? But that would move us down to y8 at turn93, which is not desired? But the problem doesn't require to stay at 9. It only requires to be at 9 at turn92.\n\nSo we can do any action at turn92: U, D, or S? But U is invalid because y9+1=10>9 -> so we clamp? The update says: y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if we do U at y9, we stay at 9? Or move to 9? The problem says: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + \\Delta y_t, and then y_{t+1} is clamped to [0,9]. \nBut the update rule: \n  if a_t = U: then \\Delta y_t = +1, so y_{t+1} = y_t + 1, but if y_t=9, then y_{t+1}=min(9, 10)=9? \nSimilarly for D: if at 0 and do D, then y_{t+1}=max(0, -1)=0.\n\nSo we can do U at turn92: then we try to move to 10, but then it becomes 9. So we stay at 9.\n\nSimilarly, S: stay at 9.\n\nD: then we move to 8.\n\nBut since we are only concerned with being at 9 at turn92 (the beginning), and then we take an action that doesn't affect that state, we can choose any. But to be safe, we can choose S or U.\n\nBut note: at turn92 we are at freeway9, so no car collision. So we can choose any.\n\nBut the problem says: avoiding collisions with cars on freeways 1-8. Since we are on freeway9, no collision.\n\nSo we can choose U, D, or S. \n\nBut the minimal action is to stay? Or we can choose U? \n\nHowever, the problem does not require to minimize the action beyond avoiding collisions. So any action is acceptable as long as we don't crash, and at freeway9 we are safe.\n\nSo we can choose S.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 88: U\nTurn 89: U\nTurn 90: U\nTurn 91: U\nTurn 92: S\n}\n\nBut let me double-check the turn numbers:\n\nt1 = 88.\n\nThe sequence: \n  a_{88} = U\n  a_{89} = U\n  a_{90} = U\n  a_{91} = U\n  a_{92} = S\n\nAnd at turn92 (which is t1+H-1 = 88+5-1=92), we are at (0,9) at the beginning of the turn.\n\nThen we take the action S at turn92, and we stay at 9.\n\nAll safety conditions are met.\n\nBut is there a shorter sequence? \n\nSuppose we try H=4: then we need to be at 9 at turn t1+4-1=91.\n\nWe start at turn88: y5.\n\nWe need to get to y9 by turn91 (which is 3 moves later). We can only get to y8 at turn91. So no.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 5.\n\nOne more thing: what if we do a down move and then more up moves? But that would take at least 5 moves: for example, down to 4 then up to 8? Then we are at 8 at turn92? We need 5 up moves? \n\nExample: \n  Turn88: D -> to y4 at turn89\n  Turn89: U -> to y5 at turn90\n  Turn90: U -> to y6 at turn91\n  Turn91: U -> to y7 at turn92\n  Then we are at y7 at turn92, not 9.\n\nTo get to 9, we need at least 4 up moves. The minimal number of turns to be at y9 is 4 moves up, so we arrive at turn92. So any detour will take at least 5 actions to be at y9 at turn92? Actually, we can be at y9 at turn92 with 4 up moves and one extra move (which can be anything) at the end. But the extra move is the fifth action.\n\nSo the minimal H is 5.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n\nBut note: we could avoid the last action by not having to do it? But the problem requires H=5 actions. So we must do 5.\n\nAlternatively, if we can be at y9 at turn92 by only 4 actions? Then we would output 4 actions and H=4? But that would require being at y9 at turn91, which we cannot.\n\nSo we are sure.\n\nBut let me check if there is a way to be at y9 earlier by using a different route that avoids blocking? \n\nBut in this case, the only blocking we have is:\n  freeway1: blocked at T=6,7,8,9 (which are turns 88+6=94, 95,96,97) -> we are done by turn92, so no issue.\n  freeway6: blocked only at T=0 (turn88) -> we are not on freeway6 at turn88 (we are on 5) and we are on freeway6 at turn89 (T=1) -> safe.\n\nSo the direct route is safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 5 and the sequence is U,U,U,U,S.\n\nBut we could do U at the last action? \n\nAt turn92: we are at y9. Then if we do U: \n  y_{93} = min(9, 9+1)=9.\n\nSo it's safe and we stay at 9.\n\nWe could also do D: then we move to 8 at turn93, but that is after the goal turn (turn92) so it doesn't matter.\n\nSo we can choose U, D, or S. The problem does not specify a preference. We choose S for simplicity.\n\nTherefore, the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 88: U\nTurn 89: U\nTurn 90: U\nTurn 91: U\nTurn 92: S\n}\n\nBut to be precise, let me write it as:\n\nTurn 88: U  \nTurn 89: U  \nTurn 90: U  \nTurn 91: U  \nTurn 92: S  \n\nNote: The problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\", so we use the turn numbers.\n\nFinal answer.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 5)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 88\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\). Collision occurs at turn \\(T\\) if the player is on freeway \\(y_T\\) and the x-coordinate \\(0\\) is within the span of any car on that freeway at turn \\(T\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Blocking Times\n- **Freeway 1**: Blocked at turns \\(t_1 + T\\) where \\(T = 6, 7, 8, 9\\) (i.e., turns 94, 95, 96, 97). Safe at other times.\n- **Freeway 2, 3, 4, 5**: Never blocked.\n- **Freeway 6**: Blocked only at \\(T = 0\\) (turn 88). Safe at other times.\n- **Freeway 7, 8**: Always safe.\n- **Freeway 9** (target): No cars, always safe.\n\nThe minimal path requires moving up 4 units to reach \\(y = 9\\). Since each \"U\" action increases \\(y\\) by 1 (clamped to \\([0, 9]\\)), at least 4 \"U\" actions are needed. The earliest turn the player can reach \\(y = 9\\) is turn 92 (starting at turn 88, with actions at turns 88, 89, 90, 91 moving to \\(y = 6, 7, 8, 9\\) at turns 89, 90, 91, 92 respectively). Thus, to be at \\((0, 9)\\) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 92\\), solve for \\(H\\):\n\\[\n88 + H - 1 = 92 \\implies H = 5\n\\]\nThe sequence has 5 actions (turns 88 to 92).\n\n### Path Validation\n- **Turn 88 (T=0)**: Start at \\(y = 5\\). Action \"U\" moves to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 89. \n  - Collision check at turn 88: freeway 5 is safe.\n- **Turn 89 (T=1)**: At \\(y = 6\\). Action \"U\" moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 90.\n  - Collision check at turn 89: freeway 6 is safe (blocked only at T=0).\n- **Turn 90 (T=2)**: At \\(y = 7\\). Action \"U\" moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 91.\n  - Collision check at turn 90: freeway 7 is safe.\n- **Turn 91 (T=3)**: At \\(y = 8\\). Action \"U\" moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 92.\n  - Collision check at turn 91: freeway 8 is safe.\n- **Turn 92 (T=4)**: At \\(y = 9\\). Action \"S\" (stay) keeps \\(y = 9\\) at turn 93.\n  - Collision check at turn 92: freeway 9 is safe.\n\nThe player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 92 (\\(t_1 + H - 1 = 88 + 5 - 1 = 92\\)). The last action (\"S\") is valid and safe, as freeway 9 has no cars.\n\nNo shorter sequence is possible, as reaching \\(y = 9\\) requires at least 4 \"U\" actions, arriving at turn 92. Alternative paths (e.g., detours) would take more turns.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe minimal sequence of 5 actions is:\n- Turn 88: \"U\"\n- Turn 89: \"U\"\n- Turn 90: \"U\"\n- Turn 91: \"U\"\n- Turn 92: \"S\"\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 88: \\ U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 89: \\ U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 90: \\ U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 91: \\ U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 92: \\ S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,7) to (0,9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 90, and I have to output a sequence of actions starting from turn 90.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9. Since we're starting at y=7 and need to get to y=9, moving up makes sense, but I have to avoid the cars on the freeways when I'm on those rows.\n\nCollision occurs only if at turn T, I'm on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The span changes over time based on the car's speed and direction.\n\nAlso, when I move to a new y-position, I'm not considered on that row until the next turn. So if at turn T, I'm on y_T, and I move to y_{T+1}, I will be on y_{T+1} at turn T+1, so I only check for collisions on y_T at turn T, not on y_{T+1} until turn T+1.\n\nNow, let's list the car states for each freeway at turn t_1=90.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head -12, tail -23, direction right, speed 3. Since it's right-moving, the span is [τ, h] = [-23, -12] at t=90. Direction is given as (head, tail, dir, speed). For right-moving, head > tail, I think. In the update, for right-moving, it says span T = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)], so at time T, the span moves right.\n\nAt turn t1=90, for freeway k, the car positions are given.\n\nFor freeway 1: car is (-12, -23, right, 3). So head is -12, tail is -23, direction right, speed 3. Since direction is right, and head > tail? -12 > -23, yes, so head is at the right, tail left.\n\nIn the span, for right-moving, it's [tail, head] at t1, I think. From the update: for right-moving, span at T is [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)], so at t1, span is [τ, h].\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)], so at t1, [h, τ].\n\nIn this case, for freeway 1: right-moving, so at t1=90, span is [τ, h] = [-23, -12].\n\nNow, collision if 0 is in [τ, h] at time T for the freeway I'm on.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2: (-48, -59, right, 12) → right-moving, span at t1: [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2: (-48, -59, right, 12) → span [-59, -48]\n\nFreeway 4: same: (-48, -59, right, 12) → span [-59, -48]\n\nFreeway 5: same: (-48, -59, right, 12) → span [-59, -48]\n\nFreeway 6: two cars: first (-48, -59, right, 12) → span [-59, -48] at t1\n\nSecond (24, 13, right, 12) → head 24, tail 13, direction right, speed 12. Since right-moving, span at t1: [τ, h] = [13, 24]\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: first (24, 13, right, 6) → right-moving, span [13, 24] at t1\n\nSecond (-42, -53, right, 6) → head -42, tail -53, direction right, so tail is -53, head -42, so span [τ, h] = [-53, -42]\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7: (24, 13, right, 6) → span [13,24]\n\nand (-42, -53, right, 6) → span [-53,-42]\n\nNow, the player is at y=7 at turn t1=90.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and there are no freeways above y=8, I think. Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=9 should be safe, no cars.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 might have something, but we're not going there.\n\nThe goal is (0,9), so when we are at y=9 at some turn, we are done, and since no freeway at y=9, no collision possible there.\n\nNow, to get from y=7 to y=9, I need to go up to y=8, then to y=9.\n\nBut on y=8, there are cars, so I need to be on y=8 at a turn when no car has 0 in its span for that freeway.\n\nSimilarly for other rows if I need to go through them.\n\nSince I start at y=7, I might go directly to y=8 or y=9, or stay, but I need to minimize turns, so probably go up as fast as possible, but avoiding collisions.\n\ny=7 has cars too, but I'm on y=7 at turn t1=90, so I need to check if at turn 90, on freeway 7, is there a collision? But the player is at (0,7) at turn 90, so for freeway 7, at turn 90, I need to see if 0 is in any car's span.\n\nFreeway 7 has two cars: one with span [13,24] at t=90, 0 is not between 13 and 24? 13 to 24, all positive, 0 not in it.\n\nSecond car: span [-53,-42], all negative, 0 not in it.\n\nSo at turn 90, on freeway 7, 0 is not in any span, so no collision at start. Good.\n\nNow, I need to get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns: since I need to go up by 2, from 7 to 9, the quickest is two U actions: at turn 90, U to y=8 at turn 91, then at turn 91, U to y=9 at turn 92.\n\nBut I need to ensure no collision at each step.\n\nFirst, at turn 90, I'm on y=7. As above, no collision.\n\nThen I take action at turn 90: suppose I do U, so y_{91} = 7 + 1 = 8.\n\nNow, at turn 91, I will be on y=8.\n\nI need to check for freeway 8 at turn 91, if 0 is in any car's span.\n\nFreeway 8 has cars at t1=90: first car (24,13,right,6), so at t=90, span [13,24]\n\nSecond car (-42,-53,right,6), span [-53,-42]\n\nNow, at turn T=91, which is T - t1 = 1, so time difference is 1 turn.\n\nFor right-moving cars, span at T: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo for first car on freeway 8: τ=13, h=24, s=6, T-t1=1\n\nSpan at t=91: [13 + 6*1, 24 + 6*1] = [19, 30]\n\nSimilarly, second car: τ=-53, h=-42, s=6\n\nSpan at t=91: [-53 + 6*1, -42 + 6*1] = [-47, -36]\n\nNow, 0 is not in [19,30] nor in [-47,-36], so no collision at turn 91 on y=8.\n\nThen at turn 91, I take another U action, so y_{92} = 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nAt turn 92, I am on y=9, which is not a freeway, so no cars, no collision possible. I have reached (0,9).\n\nAnd H=2 turns: actions at t=90 and t=91.\n\nt starts from t=90 for actions.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t=90 to t=90+H-1, and after H actions, at turn t1 + H, position should be (0,9), I think.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t1, player position is given, and we take action a_{t1}, which determines y_{t1+1}.\n\nThen at turn t1+1, we take action a_{t1+1}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, the position should be (0,9).\n\nIn this case, start at turn 90, position (0,7).\n\nAfter one action: at turn 91, position y=8 if U.\n\nAfter second action: at turn 92, position y=9.\n\nSo with H=2 actions: a_{90} and a_{91}, and at turn 92, y=9.\n\nThe minimal H should be 2, and it seems possible without collision.\n\nBut let me confirm the car positions.\n\nAt turn 91 on y=8, spans [19,30] and [-47,-36], 0 not in them, yes.\n\nWhat about when I was moving? When I take action at turn 90, U, I move to y=8, but at turn 90, I was on y=7, so I only care about freeway 7 at turn 90, which was safe.\n\nAt turn 91, I am on y=8, so I care about freeway 8 at turn 91, safe.\n\nThen at turn 91, I take U, go to y=9 at turn 92, and y=9 has no freeway.\n\nSo it should be fine.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and with two moves, I get there at turn 92.\n\nIs there any reason I cannot do this? For example, if at turn 91 on y=8, there was a car at 0, but there isn't.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider if I stay or something, but that would take more turns.\n\nMaybe for other freeways, but I don't go to them.\n\nIn this path, I only go through y=7 and y=8, and y=9.\n\ny=7 at turn 90, y=8 at turn 91, y=9 at turn 92.\n\nAll safe.\n\nBut let me check freeway 6 and 7 for completeness, but I'm not on them at relevant times.\n\nAt turn 90, I'm on y=7, freeway 7 is safe.\n\nAt turn 91, I'm on y=8, freeway 8 is safe.\n\nNo issue.\n\nPerhaps I should verify if the cars move and might cause issue later, but since I'm only there at specific turns, and I'm moving quickly, it should be ok.\n\nMaybe I can do it in one turn? But to go from y=7 to y=9 in one action? The actions only change y by at most 1, so I can't jump; I have to go through intermediate positions. So minimal H is 2, since I need to increase y by 2, each action can increase by at most 1.\n\nUnless I can go up twice, but with one action? No, each action is per turn.\n\nSo H=2 is minimal.\n\nAnd in this case, it works.\n\nBut let me look at the car states again; freeway 6 has a car at (24,13,right,12) which at t=90 is [13,24], but that's for freeway 6, not 7 or 8.\n\nFreeway 7 has (24,13,right,6) and (-42,-53,right,6), both not near 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 same as 7.\n\nFreeway 1 to 5 have cars at negative positions, moving right, so at later times, they might approach, but for turn 91, on y=8, we have spans like [19,30] which is far right, and [-47,-36] far left, 0 not in range.\n\nSimilarly, if I consider turn 92, but I don't need to, since I'm at y=9 then.\n\nBut suppose I stay or something, but no need.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if going directly up causes collision, but in this case, it doesn't.\n\nBut let me check freeway 8 at turn 90: at t=90, span for first car [13,24], 0 not in, second [-53,-42], 0 not in.\n\nAt turn 91, as calculated, [19,30] and [-47,-36], 0 not in.\n\nNow, the other cars on freeway 6: at t=90, one car [-59,-48], 0 not in, and [13,24] for freeway 6.\n\nBut I'm not on freeway 6.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 at t=90: [13,24] and [-53,-42] for the cars, but for freeway 7, the cars are (24,13,right,6) so [13,24], and (-42,-53,right,6) so [-53,-42], 0 not in.\n\nAt turn 91, for freeway 7: time diff 1, s=6, so first car: [13+6,24+6]=[19,30], second car: [-53+6,-42+6]=[-47,-36], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for all.\n\nSo going directly up seems fine.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nSo actions: at turn 90: U\n\nThen at turn 91: U\n\nAnd done.\n\nBut the answer format should be like:\n\nTurn 90: U\n\nTurn 91: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut is there any trick?\n\nI notice that on freeway 6, there is a car (24,13,right,12), and at turn 91, for freeway 6: but I'm not on it.\n\nPerhaps if I were to go to y=6 or something, but I don't need to.\n\nAnother thing: the player starts at (0,7), and needs to reach (0,9), but x is always 0, I think, since no horizontal movement, only vertical.\n\nThe position is (0,y), so only y changes.\n\nCars are on the freeways, and we care about x=0 for collision.\n\nIn the span, we care if 0 is in the span at that turn for the freeway we are on.\n\nIn this case, for y=7 and y=8 at the times I'm there, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should simulate a bit to see if cars come to 0.\n\nFor example, on freeway 8, the cars are moving right, so [13,24] at t=90, moving right at speed 6 per turn, so it will go to higher x, away from 0.\n\nSimilarly, the left one [-53,-42] moving right, so it becomes less negative, but at t=91, [-47,-36], still negative, moving away from 0? No, moving right, so from negative to less negative, towards positive, but slowly.\n\nAt t=91, [-47,-36], 0 not in.\n\nWhen would it reach around 0?\n\nSet τ + s(T-t1) = 0 or something.\n\nFor the left car on freeway 8: τ = -53, s=6, so position at T: left end is -53 + 6*(T-90)\n\nSet equal to 0: -53 + 6(T-90) =0 → 6(T-90) =53 → T-90 = 53/6 ≈8.833, so at T=99 or so, it might be near, but at turn 91, it's at -47, far from 0.\n\nSimilarly, the head is at -36 at t=91.\n\nThe span includes when left end is negative and right end positive, but here both ends negative until left end becomes positive.\n\n-53 + 6ΔT =0 when ΔT=53/6≈8.83, so at T=90+9=99, left end -53+54=1, right end -42+54=12? h=-42 at t1, so at T, h + sΔT = -42 +6ΔT.\n\nAt ΔT=9, left: -53+54=1, right: -42+54=12, so span [1,12] at T=99, which includes 0? [1,12], 1 to 12, 0 not included, since 1>0.\n\n0 is not in [1,12].\n\nWhen does it include 0? When left end <=0 and right end >=0.\n\nLeft end: -53 +6ΔT <=0 → 6ΔT <=53 → ΔT <=53/6≈8.833, so ΔT<=8\n\nRight end: -42 +6ΔT >=0 → 6ΔT >=42 → ΔT >=7\n\nSo for ΔT from 7 to 8 inclusive.\n\nΔT=7: T=97, left end -53+42= -11, right end -42+42=0? h + sΔT = -42 +6*7= -42+42=0, so span [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-53+42, -42+42] = [-11, 0]\n\nNow, is 0 included? Since it's a closed interval, I assume, so 0 is included if in [a,b] with a<=b.\n\nHere [-11,0], so 0 is included.\n\nSimilarly, at ΔT=7, T=97, span is [-11,0], which includes 0.\n\nAt ΔT=8, T=98, left: -53+48= -5, right: -42+48=6, span [-5,6], includes 0.\n\nAt ΔT=6, T=96, left: -53+36= -17, right: -42+36= -6, span [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nAt ΔT=9, T=99, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo on freeway 8, there is a car that covers x=0 at turns 97 and 98.\n\nBut in my plan, I am on y=8 at turn 91, which is fine, and I leave to y=9 at turn 92.\n\nAt turn 97 or 98, I am not on y=8, since I am at y=9 already.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nBut in this case, for my direct path, no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I need to wait or something, but not necessary.\n\nAnother thing: on freeway 6, there is a car (24,13,right,12), at t=90 [13,24], moving right fast, s=12.\n\nAt T=91, [13+12,24+12]=[25,36], not near 0.\n\nWhen would it be near 0? Since it's moving right, away from 0, never.\n\nThe other car on freeway 6: (-48,-59,right,12), at t=90 [-59,-48], moving right.\n\nLeft end -59 +12ΔT, set to 0: -59+12ΔT=0, ΔT=59/12≈4.916, so at T=95 or so.\n\nΔT=4: T=94, left: -59+48= -11, right: -48+48=0? h=-48, so at ΔT=4, span [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0], includes 0.\n\nAt ΔT=5, [-59+60, -48+60]=[1,12], not include 0.\n\nSo at T=94, on freeway 6, the car covers [-11,0], so if I were on y=6 at T=94, collision.\n\nBut I am not going there.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways have similar cars, all moving right from negative positions, so they will cover x=0 at some point.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: car (-12,-23,right,3), at t=90 [-23,-12]\n\nSet left to 0: -23 +3ΔT=0, ΔT=23/3≈7.666, so at T=98 or so.\n\nΔT=7: T=97, left: -23+21= -2, right: -12+21=9, span [-2,9], includes 0.\n\nΔT=8: T=98, [-23+24, -12+24]=[1,12], not include.\n\nSo at T=97, on freeway 1, collision if present.\n\nBut again, not relevant for me.\n\nIn my case, since I go directly to y=9 in two moves, I avoid all this.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster, but I can't.\n\nOr if I go down, but that would take more turns, not minimal.\n\nSo I think H=2 with actions U, U is fine.\n\nBut the player is at y=7 at t=90, and I need to output actions starting from t=90.\n\nAction at t=90: U, go to y=8 at t=91.\n\nThen action at t=91: U, go to y=9 at t=92.\n\nReach at turn 92.\n\nNow, in the sequence, it should be for t=90 and t=91.\n\nThe answer should be:\n\nTurn 90: U\n\nTurn 91: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me confirm the freeway for y=8.\n\ny=8 is freeway 8.\n\nAt t=91, as calculated, spans [19,30] and [-47,-36], both not containing 0.\n\nSimilarly, at t=90, on y=7, freeway 7: cars [13,24] and [-53,-42], 0 not in.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps I should write the sequence.\n\nBut the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", so t from 0 to H-1.\n\nt1=90, so a_{90} and a_{91} for H=2.\n\nt=0: a_{t1 + 0} = a_{90}\n\nt=1: a_{t1 +1} = a_{91}\n\nThen after H=2 actions, at turn t1 + H = 92, position y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nI think that's it.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose at turn 91, if I had to be on y=8 and there was a car, but there isn't.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 7, but no.\n\nAnother point: the freeway 6 has two cars, but I'm not on it.\n\nIn freeway 6, at t=90, one car is (-48,-59,right,12), which is same as others, and another (24,13,right,12), which is different.\n\nBut not relevant.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 and 8 have cars with speed 6, so slower.\n\nBut in this case, all fine.\n\nSo I think the minimal H is 2, with actions U and U.\n\nSo the sequence should be:\n\nTurn 90: U\n\nTurn 91: U\n\nIn the boxed format.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 7) at turn 90. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\n- At turn 90, the player is on freeway y=7. The cars on freeway 7 have spans [13, 24] and [-53, -42] at turn 90, neither of which contains 0, so no collision occurs.\n- Taking action U at turn 90 moves the player to y=8 at turn 91.\n- At turn 91, the player is on freeway y=8. The cars on freeway 8 have spans at turn 91 calculated as follows:\n  - For the first car (head=24, tail=13, direction=right, speed=6): span at turn 91 = [13 + 6(91-90), 24 + 6(91-90)] = [19, 30]\n  - For the second car (head=-42, tail=-53, direction=right, speed=6): span at turn 91 = [-53 + 6(91-90), -42 + 6(91-90)] = [-47, -36]\n  Neither span contains 0, so no collision occurs.\n- Taking action U at turn 91 moves the player to y=9 at turn 92.\n- At turn 92, the player is at y=9, which is not a freeway (freeways are only y=1 to 8), so no collision check is needed. The position (0, 9) is reached.\n\nThis sequence requires H=2 turns, which is minimal since the player must increase y by 2, and each action can change y by at most 1.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 90: \\ U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 91: \\ U }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 91, and the player is at (0,8). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nThe player can move up (U: +1), down (D: -1), or stay (S: 0). The vertical position is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y_T (which is the player's y-position at turn T) and at that turn T, there is a car on that freeway such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nNote: When the player moves from y to y' at turn T, then at turn T the player is still on y (so we check the car on freeway y at turn T). Then at turn T+1, the player is on y' (so we check freeway y' at turn T+1).\n\nWe start at turn 91 at y=8.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. Since we are at y=8, we can get to y=9 by moving up (U) in one turn. But we must avoid collisions.\n\nHowever, note that we are starting at y=8. So at turn 91, we are on freeway 8. We must check the cars on freeway 8 at turn 91.\n\nLooking at the car state for freeway 8:\nFreeway 8: (30,19,right,6), (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nBut note: the representation of the car is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving cars, the span is [tail, head] and moves to the right.\n\nAt turn 91 (current turn), the cars on freeway 8 are:\n\nCar 1: (30,19,right,6) -> this is a right-moving car. Since it's right-moving, the span is [tau, h] = [19, 30] (because head is at 30 and tail at 19, so the car extends from 19 to 30). But note: the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\". So at t1=91, the car is from 19 to 30.\n\nCar 2: (-36,-47,right,6) -> this is also right-moving. The span is [tau, h] = [-47, -36].\n\nWe are at x=0. We need to check if 0 is in the span of any car on freeway 8 at turn 91.\n\nFor car1: [19,30] -> 0 is not between 19 and 30 -> safe.\nFor car2: [-47,-36] -> 0 is not in this interval -> safe.\n\nSo at turn 91, we are safe at y=8.\n\nNow, we want to move to y=9. We can try to move up at turn 91 (so action U). Then at turn 92, we would be at y=9.\n\nBut we must check:\n\n- At turn 91: we are at y=8 -> safe as above.\n- Then we take action U. So at turn 92, we are at y=9.\n\nHowever, we must check if we are safe at turn 92 at y=9? But note: the goal is to reach (0,9). And the problem says we must avoid collisions at every turn until we reach the goal. So we must not collide at turn 92.\n\nBut note: the goal is at y=9. There are no freeways above 9? The freeways are from y=1 to y=8. The player at y=9 is above the freeways? Actually, the freeways are only at y=1 to 8. So there are no cars at y=9. Therefore, when we are at y=9, we are safe.\n\nSo the minimal H should be 1? Because we can move from y=8 to y=9 in one move.\n\nBut let me double-check the rules: the grid has vertical axis y=0,1,...,9. And the freeways are at y=1,...,8. So y=0 and y=9 are safe? The problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". So if we are at y=0 or y=9, there are no cars, so we are safe.\n\nTherefore, the plan: at turn 91, use action U to move to y=9.\n\nBut wait: what about during the move? The rule says: if we move at turn T from y to y', then at turn T we are on y (so we check freeway y at turn T) and at turn T+1 we are on y' (so we check freeway y' at turn T+1). Since we are moving from y=8 to y=9, at turn 91 we are on freeway 8 (which we checked and it's safe) and at turn 92 we are on freeway 9 (which has no cars, so safe). Therefore, we are safe.\n\nBut is there a catch? Let me look at the car movements.\n\nThe cars are moving. We are at turn 91. We need to check the cars at freeway 8 at turn 91 (which we did) and at freeway 9 we don't check because there are no cars. So it seems safe.\n\nBut wait: what if at turn 91, when we are at y=8, we are safe, but what if at the same turn 91, the cars on freeway 8 move and we have to check the span at turn 91? The car state is given at turn 91. So we have the spans at turn 91.\n\nThe update rules are for T > t1. At T = t1, the car is at the state given.\n\nSo at turn 91, the cars on freeway 8 are as given: [19,30] and [-47,-36]. Both do not contain 0.\n\nTherefore, we can move up at turn 91 and reach y=9 at turn 92.\n\nBut the problem asks for the minimal number of turns H. H is the number of turns in the sequence? The sequence is from t=0 to H-1. So if we take one action (at turn 91) then H=1? But then the position at turn 91+H-1 = turn 91+0 = turn 91? That would be the starting turn. But we are at (0,8) at turn 91, and we want to be at (0,9) at turn 91+H-1.\n\nIf H=1, then we are at turn 91 (since t=0 to H-1=0, so only t=0). But at turn 91 we are at y=8, not 9. So we need at least one action to change to y=9.\n\nTherefore, we need H=2: actions at turn 91 (t=0) and turn 92 (t=1)? But wait, the sequence is for t=0 to H-1. So if H=2, we have two actions: at turn91 and turn92? But we only need one move.\n\nActually, note: we start at turn 91. We take an action at turn 91, which leads to the next state at turn 92. So to be at y=9 at the end of the sequence, we need to have taken an action that gets us to y=9 at the next turn.\n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that after H turns, we are at (0,9)\".\n\nAt turn t1 (91) we are at (0,8). We take an action a_{91}. Then at turn 92, we are at a new y. We want that at turn 91 + H - 1, we are at (0,9). \n\nIf we take one action (H=1) then we are at turn 91 (since t=0 to 0) and we haven't moved? Then we are still at (0,8). So we need H=2: \n- t=0: turn91: action a91\n- t=1: turn92: action a92? But then the position at turn91+2-1 = turn92 is (0,9). \n\nBut actually, we only need one action: at turn91 we do U, then at turn92 we are at y=9. So the sequence has one action? But the problem says the sequence is from t=0 to H-1. So if H=1, we do one action at t=0 (turn91) and then the position at turn91+1-1 = turn91 is the position after the action? But the action at turn91 changes the position at turn92. \n\nLet me read the update: \ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo at turn91, we take action a91, which determines y92. Then at turn92, we are at y92.\n\nWe want that at turn91 + H - 1, we are at (0,9). \n\nSet T = t1 + H - 1 = 91 + H - 1.\n\nWe want y_T = 9.\n\nIf we take one action at turn91 (so H=1), then T = 91 + 1 - 1 = 91. But at turn91 we are at y=8. So we need H=2: then T = 91+2-1 = 92. We want y92=9.\n\nTherefore, we need two actions? But note: we only need to move once. However, the sequence must have H actions? Actually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo if we take H=2, we have two actions: a91 and a92. Then at turn92 (which is 91+2-1=92) we are at y92. We want y92=9.\n\nBut we can set:\n- a91 = U -> then y92 = 8+1 = 9.\n- Then at turn92, we are at y=9. We don't need to do anything else. But we must specify an action for turn92? However, we have to specify two actions. But we can set a92 to anything? But we must avoid collisions.\n\nAlternatively, we can set a92 to S (stay) because we are already at y=9. Then we are safe at turn92 because y=9 has no cars.\n\nBut wait: what if we set a91=U and a92=S? Then:\n- Turn91: we start at y=8, take U -> then at turn92, we are at y=9.\n- Then at turn92: we take S -> stay at y=9.\n\nBut the goal is reached at turn92 (which is the end of the sequence). So we have two actions.\n\nBut can we have H=1? That would require that at turn91 (without any action) we are at y=9. But we are at y=8. So H=1 is impossible.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 2.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in H=1? No. So H=2 is minimal.\n\nBut let me confirm: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". And we have to specify the sequence of actions for H turns.\n\nSo the sequence is:\nTurn 91: U\nTurn 92: S   (or we could do anything? But we are at y=9, so we can stay. Or even move down? But that would be bad because we would leave y=9. But we only care about reaching y=9 at turn92. But we are already at y=9 at turn92, so we can choose S to stay.)\n\nBut note: we must avoid collisions at every turn. At turn92, we are at y=9 -> safe. So S is safe.\n\nAlternatively, we could do:\nTurn91: U -> then at turn92 we are at y=9.\nTurn92: U -> but y cannot go above 9. So y93 = min(9+1,9)=9? The rule says y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if we try to go up from 9, we stay at 9? Or the move is clipped? The problem says: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and then we have y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9]. So if we are at 9 and do U, we get 10 -> then clipped to 9? Or is it disallowed? The problem doesn't specify clipping, but it says y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9]. So we assume that if the move would take us outside, we stay at the boundary? Actually, the problem says: \"y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9]\" and the update is defined as adding the delta, so we must clamp.\n\nBut in any case, we are at y=9 at turn92, so we are done. We can choose S for the second action to avoid any issue.\n\nSo the sequence: \nTurn 91: U\nTurn 92: S\n\nBut wait: what if we do only one action and then stop? But the problem requires the sequence to have H actions. Since H=2, we must specify two actions.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to get to y=9 in one step? But we start at y=8, so we need at least one U. And that one U will take us to y=9 at the next turn, which is turn92. Therefore, we must have H=2.\n\nBut let me check the cars again to ensure safety.\n\nAt turn91 (current turn): we are at y=8. The cars on freeway8 at turn91 are:\nCar1: [19,30] -> doesn't cover 0.\nCar2: [-47,-36] -> doesn't cover 0.\n\nThen we take action U at turn91. This moves us to y=9 at turn92.\n\nAt turn92: we are at y=9 -> no cars, so safe.\n\nThen we take action S at turn92: we stay at y=9 -> safe.\n\nBut note: we must also check that during the move, we are safe at every step. The only steps are turn91 and turn92.\n\nAt turn91: we are at y=8 -> safe (as above).\nAt turn92: we are at y=9 -> safe.\n\nTherefore, this plan is safe.\n\nBut wait: what about the cars on other freeways? We don't go to them. We only care about the freeway we are on at each turn.\n\nAt turn91: we are on freeway8 -> check freeway8 at turn91 -> safe.\nAt turn92: we are on freeway9 -> no cars -> safe.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nBut why are there cars listed for freeways 1 to 8? We are only concerned with the freeway we are on. Since we are only on freeway8 at turn91 and freeway9 at turn92, we don't need to worry about the others.\n\nBut wait: what if we had to move through other freeways? But in this case, we are going from y=8 to y=9, so we only step on freeway8 at turn91 and freeway9 at turn92.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 2.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we found a plan with H=2.\n\nBut is there a plan with H=1? That would require that at turn91 we are at y=9, but we are at y=8. So impossible.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 91: U\nTurn 92: S\n}\n\nBut let me check the car movements for the next turns to be sure.\n\nThe cars are moving. We need to check the cars on freeway8 at turn91 and freeway9 at turn92.\n\nWe already have the state at turn91. How about at turn92? For freeway8 at turn92, we don't care because we are not on freeway8 at turn92. But note: we are on freeway8 only at turn91. At turn92 we are on freeway9.\n\nHowever, let me verify the car on freeway8 at turn91: we have two cars. They are moving at constant speed.\n\nFor the car1 on freeway8: (30,19,right,6) at turn91. Since it is right-moving, at turn92 (T=92, so T-t1=1), the car moves: \nNew head = 30 + 6*1 = 36\nNew tail = 19 + 6*1 = 25\nSo the span becomes [25,36]. 0 is not in [25,36] -> safe? But we are not on freeway8 at turn92, so we don't care.\n\nSimilarly, car2: (-36,-47,right,6) at turn91 -> at turn92: \nhead = -36 + 6 = -30\ntail = -47 + 6 = -41\nspan [-41, -30] -> 0 not in it.\n\nBut again, we are not on freeway8 at turn92.\n\nAt turn92, we are on freeway9 -> no cars -> safe.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nBut wait: the car state for freeway6 and freeway7 and others? We never step on them, so we don't care.\n\nTherefore, the minimal plan is two turns.\n\nBut the initial position is (0,8) and we are going to (0,9). We are moving up one step. It should be straightforward.\n\nBut why is the problem giving so many cars? Maybe to distract? Or maybe if we started at a lower y we would have to navigate through multiple lanes? But here we are already at y=8, one step below the goal.\n\nSo I think we are overcomplicating. The answer should be:\n\nTurn 91: U\nTurn 92: S\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and so on. So we write:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 91: U\nTurn 92: S\n}\n\nBut wait, the second turn is turn92, which is t1+1 (since t1=91, so t1+1=92). The sequence is for t=0 to H-1, which is two actions: at t1+0 and t1+1.\n\nSo the format is:\n\nTurn 91: U\nTurn 92: S\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" meaning at turn t1 we do a_{t1}. Then next is \"Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}\", etc.\n\nSo we write:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 91: U\nTurn 92: S\n}\n\nBut let me see if we can avoid the second action? The problem requires a sequence of H actions. Since H=2, we have to provide two actions. We cannot skip the second action.\n\nWe could do U at turn91 and then at turn92 we are at y=9, and then we don't care? But the problem says we must specify the sequence until we reach the goal at turn t1+H-1. So at turn92 (which is the turn we reach the goal) we are at y=9. But we still have to specify the action at turn92? Because the sequence must have H=2 actions.\n\nSo we must specify two actions. The second action doesn't change the position (if we choose S) and we are safe.\n\nAlternatively, we could do U at turn91 and then at turn92 we do U again? Then we try to go to y=10, but it will clamp to 9. So we are still at 9. And we are safe. But that would be the same.\n\nBut S is more natural.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut wait: what if at turn92 we do D? Then we go to y=8. Then we are not at the goal. So we must do an action that keeps us at y=9? So either S or U (if clamped) would work.\n\nBut to be safe and clear, we do S.\n\nTherefore, the answer is as above.\n\nBut let me check the car on freeway8 at turn91 again. The car state for freeway8 has two cars: (30,19,right,6) and (-36,-47,right,6). At turn91, the positions are:\n\nCar1: from 19 to 30 -> 0 not in [19,30] -> safe.\nCar2: from -47 to -36 -> 0 not in [-47,-36] -> safe.\n\nAnd we move at turn91 to y=9, so we are safe.\n\nSo I think we are good.\n\nBut why is there a car (36,25,right,12) on freeway6? We don't use freeway6. Similarly, other freeways have cars, but we are only at y=8 and then y=9.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 2.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose we try to do nothing at turn91? Then we stay at y=8. Then at turn92 we are still at y=8. Then we must move up at turn92 to get to y=9 at turn93. Then we would need two actions: S at turn91 and U at turn92, and then we are at y=9 at turn93. So H=3? That's worse.\n\nAlternatively, we could move down? But that would take us away from the goal.\n\nSo the minimal is indeed H=2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 91: U\nTurn 92: S\n}\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) at turn 91. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1 to 8.\n\n### Analysis:\n- At turn 91, the player is on freeway 8. The cars on freeway 8 are:\n  - Car 1: Span = [19, 30] (right-moving, speed 6)\n  - Car 2: Span = [-47, -36] (right-moving, speed 6)\n- The player's x-position is 0. Since 0 is not in [19, 30] or [-47, -36], there is no collision at turn 91.\n- To reach y = 9, the player must move up (U) from y = 8. This action is taken at turn 91, resulting in y = 9 at turn 92.\n- At turn 92, the player is on y = 9. Since there are no freeways or cars at y = 9, this position is safe.\n- The sequence requires two turns (H = 2) because:\n  - At turn 91 (starting turn), the player is at y = 8.\n  - After one action (U at turn 91), the player reaches y = 9 at turn 92.\n  - The position at turn 91 + H - 1 = 91 + 2 - 1 = 92 must be (0, 9), which is achieved.\n- At turn 92, an action is needed to complete the sequence of H = 2 actions. Choosing S (stay) ensures the player remains at y = 9 and avoids any movement issues (e.g., attempting to move up from y = 9 would be clipped to y = 9, but S is straightforward and safe).\n\n### Collision Check:\n- **Turn 91 (y = 8)**: Cars on freeway 8 at turn 91 do not span x = 0 (as above). Safe.\n- **Turn 92 (y = 9)**: No cars exist at y = 9. Safe.\n\n### Minimal Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions for H = 2 is:\n- Turn 91: U (move up to y = 9 at turn 92)\n- Turn 92: S (stay at y = 9, ensuring the goal is maintained)\n\nThis achieves the goal in minimal turns (H = 2) with no collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 91: U\nTurn 92: S\n}",
