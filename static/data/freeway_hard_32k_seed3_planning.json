        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars. The player moves vertically, and cars move horizontally on freeways y=1 to y=8. Collision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T and there's a car on that freeway such that 0 is in its span at that exact turn.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at each turn relative to turn t_1, which is t_0=0. So for any future turn T, the car positions are determined by their initial state at t_1=0.\n\nLet me list out the cars for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, head -48, tail -95, direction right, speed 48. Since it's moving right, the span at time T is [τ + s*T, h + s*T] = [-95 + 48T, -48 + 48T]\n\nDirection right: span at T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] with t1=0, so [τ + sT, h + sT]\n\nSimilarly, left: [h - sT, τ - sT]\n\nFor freeway 1: d=right, so span at T: [τ + sT, h + sT] = [-95 + 48T, -48 + 48T]\n\nCollision if 0 in this interval, so -95 + 48T ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 48T\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut we need for each freeway, and we care about when the player is on that row.\n\nAlso, player moves: at each turn, action U, D, or S, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, clamped to 0-9.\n\nStart at y=0, need to reach y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars there, only freeways 1-8 have cars.\n\nCars are on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,0), which is not on a freeway, I think. Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, when at y=9, safe.\n\nNow, the path: player must go through y=1 to 8, but can skip some if moving vertically, but since moves are ±1 or 0, must pass through each integer y, I think, but can stay or move up/down.\n\nBut to minimize turns, probably want to move up as fast as possible, but need to avoid collisions.\n\nH is the number of turns, including the starting turn? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so actions a_t1 to a_t1+H-1, and after H turns, position is y_{t1+H} =9, I think.\n\nTurn notation: at turn t, we perform action a_t, then position updates to y_{t+1}.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nFrom game dynamics:\n\n\"y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\" based on a_t.\n\nAnd collision at turn T if on freeway y_T and car span contains 0 at turn T.\n\nTurn T: at that turn, position y_T, and we check for collision on freeway y_T at that turn.\n\nAlso, \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\"\n\nSo at turn T, you are on row y_T, and we check cars on row y_T at time T.\n\nIf you move, at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, and check cars on row y_{T+1} at time T+1.\n\nSo for each turn, we are on a specific row, and we check the cars on that row at that exact time.\n\nNow, for the cars, their position at time T depends on initial at t1=0.\n\nt1 is the current turn, which is 0.\n\nSo for each freeway, I need to find when it is safe to be on that row, i.e., when no car has 0 in its span.\n\nSince multiple cars per freeway, need for each freeway, at time T, that for all cars on that freeway, 0 not in span.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars for each freeway:\n\nFrom table:\n\nFreeway 1: only one car: (head h=-48, tail τ=-95, dir right, speed s=48)\n\nFreeway 2: two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFreeway 4: (48,83,left,36) — one car? head and tail, but direction left.\n\nFreeway 5: same as 4? (48,83,left,36)\n\nFreeway 6: (-48,-59,right,6) — one car\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (48,37,right,4) and (0,-11,right,4)\n\nFreeway 8: (-48,-59,right,3) — one car\n\nNow, for each, I need the span at time T.\n\nSince t1=0, span at T is as above.\n\nCollision on freeway k at time T if there exists a car on k such that 0 is in [low, high] for that car.\n\nFor direction right, span is [τ + sT, h + sT] since τ is tail, h is head, so if right, moving right, tail to head, so [τ + sT, h + sT], with τ < h.\n\nSimilarly, left, moving left, head to tail, so [h - sT, τ - sT], with h > τ.\n\nIn the description: for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\"\n\nBut if it's left-moving, and span at t1 is [h, τ], with h and τ, but which is head? In the text, it says \"head is at h, tail is at τ\", but for left-moving, if it's moving left, the head should be on the left, I think.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"Car update rules: For car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail is at τ at turn t1, and speed s.\"\n\nThen for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\"\n\nBut for a left-moving car, if head is at h, tail at τ, and it's moving left, then at time t1, the span is from head to tail, but since moving left, head is greater than tail? Let's see an example.\n\nIn freeway 4: (48,83,left,36) — head=48, tail=83? But 48 to 83, if moving left, that doesn't make sense because moving left would decrease positions.\n\nI think there might be a inconsistency in notation.\n\nLet's see the values.\n\nFor freeway 4: head=48, tail=83, dir=left, s=36.\n\nAt t1=0, span is [h, τ] = [48,83], but since dir left, moving left, so at time T, span is [h - sT, τ - sT] = [48 - 36T, 83 - 36T]\n\nNow, 48 - 36T and 83 - 36T, since T increases, this span moves left, so the left end decreases, right end decreases, so the car is moving left, which makes sense, but the head is at h=48, which is the left end, I think, but at t=0, [48,83], so x from 48 to 83, with head at 48, tail at 83, so the car is from left to right? But it's moving left, so the head should be on the right.\n\nI think there's confusion in \"head\" and \"tail\" definition.\n\nPerhaps \"head\" is the front of the car, so for left-moving, front is on the left, so at t=0, head at h, tail at τ, with h < τ for left-moving? But in the span [h,τ], if h=48, τ=83, h<τ, so from low to high x.\n\nBut when moving left, the front is decreasing, so at time T, positions decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, head at h, tail at τ, with for right-moving, head on right, so h > τ, like freeway 1: head -48, tail -95, so h=-48, τ=-95, so h > τ since -48 > -95.\n\nThen for right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h]? No.\n\nFrom the text: for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\"\n\nIn the text: \"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\"\n\n\"Right-moving: [Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\"\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t1) is given as [τ, h], so for example, freeway 1: τ=-95, h=-48, so [ -95, -48 ], and since moving right, at T, [ -95 +48T, -48 +48T ]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, like freeway 4: h=48, τ=83, Span(t1) = [h, τ] = [48,83], and moving left, at T, [48-36T, 83-36T]\n\nNow, for collision, we care about whether 0 is in the span at time T.\n\nAlso, for multiple cars, we need that for all cars on that freeway, 0 not in their span at T.\n\nBut for a given freeway at time T, if any car has 0 in span, collision.\n\nSo for each freeway, I need to find times T when it is safe, i.e., no car covers x=0.\n\nThen, for the player, when moving to a row, at that turn T, it must be safe for that row.\n\nNow, player starts at turn t=0, y=0.\n\ny=0 is not a freeway, so no collision check at y=0 or y=9.\n\nAt turn 0, position is (0,0), and we perform action a_0, which determines y_1.\n\nThen at turn 1, we are at y_1, and we check collision on freeway y_1 if y_1 between 1 and 8.\n\nSimilarly for each turn.\n\nWe need to reach y=9, so when y_t =9 for some t, and since y=9 safe, no issue.\n\nH is the number of turns, so from t=0 to t=H-1, we perform H actions, and after that, at time H, position is y_H =9.\n\nAfter H actions, we have done H moves, from t=0 to t=H-1, and position y_H =9.\n\nThe sequence is {a_t for t=0 to H-1}, and y_H =9.\n\nAt each turn t, when we are at y_t, we check for collision.\n\nFor t=0, y_0=0, not on freeway, no collision.\n\nThen action a_0, go to y_1.\n\nAt t=1, y_1, check if y_1 in 1-8, if so, check cars.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to go up as fast as possible, but may need to wait or detour to avoid collisions.\n\nSince we can only move ±1 or 0, to go from 0 to 9, minimum H is 9 if we always go up, but may not be possible due to cars.\n\nIf we go up every turn, we reach y=9 at t=9, with actions U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U from t=0 to 8, y from 0 to 9.\n\ny_0=0, after a_0=U, y_1=1, at t=1 on y=1, check collision; then a_1=U, y_2=2, at t=2 on y=2, and so on, up to a_8=U, y_9=9, at t=9 on y=9, safe.\n\nBut at each intermediate turn, on y=1 to 8 at times t=1 to 8, may have collision.\n\nSo we need to check for each freeway at times when player might be there.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway the times when it is unsafe, i.e., when some car covers x=0.\n\nThen for the player, when on that row at that time, collision.\n\nSo let's compute for each freeway k, the set of T where freeway k is unsafe at time T.\n\nStart with freeway 1: y=1\n\nOne car: right-moving, τ=-95, h=-48, s=48\n\nSpan at T: [ -95 +48T, -48 +48T ]\n\n0 in span if -95 +48T ≤ 0 ≤ -48 +48T\n\nWhich is 48T ≤ 95 and 48T ≥ 48? Let's solve inequalities.\n\n-95 +48T ≤ 0 ⇒ 48T ≤ 95 ⇒ T ≤ 95/48 ≈ 1.979, so T ≤ 1 since T integer? T is turn number, integer.\n\nT is discrete, turns are integer, I assume.\n\nSimilarly, 0 ≤ -48 +48T ⇒ 48T ≥ 48 ⇒ T ≥ 1\n\nSo T ≥1 and T ≤ 95/48 ≈1.979, so T≤1 since T integer? T≥1 and T≤1.979, so for integer T, T=1\n\nT=1: -95 +48*1 = -95+48= -47 ≤0? -47 ≤0 true, 0 ≤ -48 +48*1 = -48+48=0, 0≤0 true, so yes, 0 in span.\n\nT=2: -95+96=1 >0, so 0 not ≤ left end? Left end is -95+48T, at T=2, -95+96=1, right end -48+96=48, so [1,48], 0 not in [1,48], since 0<1.\n\nT=0: [ -95, -48], 0 not in, since both negative.\n\nSo only at T=1, freeway 1 is unsafe.\n\nFor T=1 only.\n\nNow freeway 2: y=2\n\nTwo cars, both right-moving, s=12.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12) — head=48, tail=37? From the table: \" (48, 37, right, 12) \" and for right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h], so τ=37? Head and tail, in the car state: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor this, head=48, tail=37, dir=right.\n\nSince right, span at t1: [τ, h] = [37, 48]\n\nThen at T: [37 + 12T, 48 + 12T]\n\n0 in span if 37+12T ≤ 0 ≤ 48+12T\n\nBut 37+12T ≤0? 37+12T is at least 37>0 for T>=0, so always positive, never <=0, so 0 not in span for this car, for any T.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (0, -11, right, 12) head=0, tail=-11\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt T: [-11 +12T, 0 +12T] = [-11+12T, 12T]\n\n0 in span if -11+12T ≤ 0 ≤ 12T\n\nWhich is 12T ≤ 11? No:\n\n-11+12T ≤ 0 ⇒ 12T ≤ 11 ⇒ T ≤ 11/12 ≈ 0.916, so T≤0 since T integer >=0\n\nAnd 0 ≤ 12T ⇒ T≥0\n\nSo T=0: -11+0 = -11 ≤0, 0≤0, true.\n\nT=1: -11+12=1 ≤0? 1≤0 false, so 0 not <= left end?

Safe.\n\nThen a_8: U to y=8.\n\ny_9=8 at t=9.\n\nNow at t=9, on y=8.\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=16 to 19.\n\nAt t=9, is it safe?\n\nFreeway 8: car span [-59+3T, -48+3T]\n\nAt T=9: -59+27= -32, -48+27= -21, both negative, 0 not in. Safe.\n\nThen a_9: U to y=9.\n\ny_10=9 at t=10.\n\nNow at t=10, on y=9, safe.\n\nSo we reached y=9 at t=10, with actions from t=0 to t=9.\n\nSequence: t=0: S (stay)\n\nt=1: U (up)\n\nt=2: U\n\nt=3: U\n\nt=4: U\n\nt=5: U\n\nt=6: U\n\nt=7: U\n\nt=8: U\n\nt=9: U\n\ny_10=9.\n\nH=10 turns? Actions from t=0 to t=9, 10 actions.\n\nBut we started at t=0, y=0, and after 10 actions, at t=10, y=10? y_t with t starting from 0.\n\ny_0=0\n\nAfter a_0, y_1\n\n...\n\nAfter a_9, y_10\n\nYes, y_10=9.\n\nBut is this minimal? We delayed at the beginning by staying one turn.\n\nCan we avoid that?\n\nEarlier, at t=0, if we go up, we crash at t=1 on y=1.\n\nBut what if we go down? Cannot at y=0.\n\nSo must stay at t=0.\n\nPerhaps go up later.\n\nAnother idea: since y=2 and y=3 are safe after t=0, but we need to go through them.\n\nIn this path, we went through all rows at times when safe.\n\nBut y=6 unsafe at t=8,9, but we were on y=6 at t=7, which is safe, then to y=7 at t=8.\n\nt=7: y_7=6, safe\n\na_7=U, y_8=7 at t=8, safe\n\ny=7 safe at t=8.\n\nThen to y=8 at t=9, safe.\n\nBut y=6 is unsafe at t=8 and t=9, but we were not on it at those times.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nCan we reach faster?\n\nMinimum possible is 9 turns: if always up, from t=0 to 8, y from 0 to 9 at t=9.\n\nBut at t=1, on y=1, unsafe, crash.\n\nSo impossible to go directly up.\n\nWhat if we stay at y=0 for more turns? But that would take more time, worse.\n\nOr go down, but cannot.\n\nPerhaps skip some rows or wait, but since we have to go through all, minimum 9 actions if no waiting, but with waiting, more.\n\nIn our case, we have 10 actions with one stay.\n\nBut perhaps we can go up faster in some parts.\n\nFor example, at t=0, we must stay or crash, so we need to start with S.\n\nThen from t=1, we can go up each turn.\n\nIn the sequence above, from t=1 to t=9 we go up every turn, except t=0 stay.\n\nt=0: S, y1=0\n\nt=1: U, y2=1\n\nt=2: U, y3=2\n\n...\n\nt=8: U, y9=8\n\nt=9: U, y10=9\n\ny9=8 at t=9, then a9=U, y10=9.\n\nAt t=9, we are on y=8, which is safe as above.\n\nIn this, we were on y=1 at t=2? t=2: position y2=1 (after a1=U at t=1)\n\nAt turn t=2, y2=1\n\nWhich is safe, as y=1 unsafe only at t=1.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 at t=3, safe.\n\ny=3 at t=4, safe.\n\ny=4 at t=5, safe.\n\ny=5 at t=6, safe.\n\ny=6 at t=7, safe.\n\ny=7 at t=8, safe.\n\ny=8 at t=9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nH=10.\n\nBut can we do in 9?\n\nSuppose we want to be at y=9 at t=9.\n\nThen we need to be on y=9 at turn t=9.\n\nSince y_9=9.\n\nTo have y_9=9, we need to have started from y_0=0, and done 9 up moves in 9 turns, so must have a_t=U for t=0 to 8, y_t = t for t=0 to 9? y_0=0, a0=U, y1=1, a1=U, y2=2, ..., a8=U, y9=9.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nFor t=1, y1=1, but y=1 unsafe at t=1, collision.\n\nThus, impossible to be on y=1 at t=1 without collision.\n\nTherefore, minimum H must be at least 10.\n\nWith H=10, we have a sequence.\n\nIn the sequence above, we used only U and one S.\n\nBut in the answer, we need to specify the actions.\n\nt_1 is given as t_1, but in this case t_1=0.\n\nThe answer should be for turns starting from t_1.\n\nIn the problem: \"current turn is {t_1}\", and \"sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nIn this case t_1=0.\n\nSo actions from t=0 to H-1.\n\nIn our case H=10, actions t=0 to 9.\n\nSequence: t=0: S\n\nt=1: U\n\nt=2: U\n\nt=3: U\n\nt=4: U\n\nt=5: U\n\nt=6: U\n\nt=7: U\n\nt=8: U\n\nt=9: U\n\nBut let's confirm the times and rows.\n\nTurn t | action a_t | position y_{t+1} ? No.\n\nAt turn t, we perform action a_t, and position after is y_{t+1}.\n\nBut collision is checked at turn t based on y_t.\n\nDefine:\n\n- At turn t, position is y_t\n\n- Perform action a_t\n\n- Then position becomes y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\n- At turn t, we check collision based on y_t and time t.\n\nFor turn t, if y_t between 1 and 8, check cars on row y_t at time t.\n\nIn our sequence:\n\nt=0: y_0=0, no collision (since not on freeway)\n\na_0 = S, so y_1 = y_0 + 0 = 0\n\nt=1: y_1=0, no collision\n\na_1 = U, so y_2 = 0 + 1 = 1\n\nt=2: y_2=1, now on freeway y=1 at time t=2\n\nCheck y=1 at t=2: as before, safe.\n\na_2 = U, y_3 = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nt=3: y_3=2, on freeway y=2 at time t=3\n\nSafe, as before.\n\na_3 = U, y_4 = 3\n\nt=4: y_4=3, on y=3 at t=4\n\ny=3 unsafe only at t=0, so at t=4 safe.\n\na_4 = U, y_5=4\n\nt=5: y_5=4, on y=4 at t=5\n\nSafe, as before.\n\na_5 = U, y_6=5\n\nt=6: y_6=5, on y=5 at t=6\n\ny=5 unsafe only at t=2, so at t=6 safe.\n\na_6 = U, y_7=6\n\nt=7: y_7=6, on y=6 at t=7\n\nSafe, as before.\n\na_7 = U, y_8=7\n\nt=8: y_8=7, on y=7 at t=8\n\nSafe.\n\na_8 = U, y_9=8\n\nt=9: y_9=8, on y=8 at t=9\n\nSafe.\n\na_9 = U, y_10=9\n\nAt t=10, y_10=9, but we don't check collision at t=10 since we reached, and H is such that y_{t1+H} =9, I think.\n\nThe position after H actions is y_{t1 + H}.\n\nIn this case, at turn t=9, we perform a_9, and go to y_10=9.\n\nAnd at turn t=9, we were on y_9=8, which is safe.\n\nSo we reached at t=10 with y_10=9.\n\nH=10.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier?\n\nSuppose we go to y=1 at a later time.\n\nFor example, at t=0, instead of staying, we must stay or crash.\n\nPerhaps go to another row.\n\nBut we start at y=0, must go through y=1 eventually.\n\ny=1 is only unsafe at t=1, so if we can be on y=1 at another time.\n\nFor example, if we stay at y=0 for one turn, then at t=1, we are at y=0, then go to y=1 at t=2, which is safe.\n\nAs we did.\n\nIf we could go directly to y=2, but we cannot, moves are only ±1 or 0, so must go through y=1.\n\nSimilarly, all rows.\n\nSo I think H=10 is minimal.\n\nBut let's check if we can save time elsewhere.\n\nFor example, at y=6, it is unsafe at t=8 and t=9, but in our path, we are on y=6 at t=7, which is fine.\n\nIf we were on y=6 at t=8, it would crash, but we are not.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 7, it is unsafe at t=0,1,2, but we are on it at t=8, safe.\n\nAll seems fine.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster by not staying, but we have to avoid t=1 on y=1.\n\nSo I think 10 is minimum.\n\nNow, the sequence: actions from t=0 to t=9: S, U, U, U, U, U, U, U, U, U\n\nIn the answer format, for turn t_1=0.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 0: S\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: U\n\n...\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nBut turn indices: t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt_1=0, t from 0 to 9, so turns 0 to 9.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nSince t_1 is given as {t_1}, but in this case it's 0.\n\nIn the answer, it should be with t_1.\n\nBut in the output, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo for this case.\n\nPerhaps we need to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the car state, there is freeway 3, same as 2, and freeway 5 same as 4, but we didn't use them directly, but the unsafe times are covered.\n\nIn our path, we passed all rows except possibly, but we did y=1 to 8.\n\ny=3 is there, at t=4.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo I think this works.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we did.\n\nNow, the sequence has 10 actions.\n\nBut let's confirm H.\n\nMinimal number of turns H=10.\n\nSequence: a_0 = S, a_1 to a_9 = U.\n\na_1 to a_9 are all U, but a_0 is S.\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to 9.\n\nIn the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn t_1: S Turn t_1 + 1: U Turn t_1 + 2: U Turn t_1 + 3: U Turn t_1 + 4: U Turn t_1 + 5: U Turn t_1 + 6: U Turn t_1 + 7: U Turn t_1 + 8: U Turn t_1 + 9: U }\n\nSince t_1=0, but in general.\n\nBut in the output, it should be with variables or just for this.\n\nThe problem says \"determine for the given state\", so we output the actions.\n\nt_1 is given as 0.\n\nIn the box, we write the turns with t_1.\n\nBut since t_1=0, we can write:\n\nTurn 0: S\n\nTurn 1: U\n\n...\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nBut to be precise.\n\nIn the answer format: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo for t_1=0:\n\nTurn 0: S\n\nTurn 1: U\n\n...\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nBut Turn t_1 + 1 is Turn 1, etc.\n\nNow, H=10.\n\nBut is there a sequence with H=9? We saw not.\n\nPerhaps by moving down or something, but no, that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if at some point we move down to avoid, but that increases time.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, minimal H is 10.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 6, unsafe at t=8,9, but we are not there.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 unsafe at t=16-19, far away.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is as above.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 9, we go to y=9, but at turn 9, we are on y=8, perform U, to y=9.\n\nAnd at turn 9, y=8 is safe.\n\nNow, write the answer.\n\nBut the player position is given as (0, y_{t_1}), and we need to reach (0,9).\n\nIn the output, we need the actions.\n\nPerhaps we should list all.\n\nSince it's multiple lines.\n\nIn the box.\n\nSo for this case:\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 0: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 1: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U }\n\nBut Turn 0 to Turn 9, that's 10 turns.\n\nH=10.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to t=9.\n\nYes.\n\nTo be with t_1.\n\nSince t_1=0, it's fine.\n\nI think this is correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 0\\) is 10. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on an unsafe freeway at an unsafe turn.\n\n### Key Points from Car Analysis:\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: Unsafe only at turn \\(T=1\\).\n- **Freeway 2 (y=2)**: Unsafe only at turn \\(T=0\\).\n- **Freeway 3 (y=3)**: Unsafe only at turn \\(T=0\\) (same as freeway 2).\n- **Freeway 4 (y=4)**: Unsafe only at turn \\(T=2\\).\n- **Freeway 5 (y=5)**: Unsafe only at turn \\(T=2\\) (same as freeway 4).\n- **Freeway 6 (y=6)**: Unsafe at turns \\(T=8\\) and \\(T=9\\).\n- **Freeway 7 (y=7)**: Unsafe at turns \\(T=0, 1, 2\\).\n- **Freeway 8 (y=8)**: Unsafe at turns \\(T=16\\) to \\(T=19\\).\n\n### Strategy:\n- Start at turn \\(t=0\\), \\(y=0\\) (safe, not a freeway).\n- At turn \\(t=0\\), stay (action S) to avoid moving to \\(y=1\\) at turn \\(t=1\\) (where freeway 1 is unsafe).\n- From turn \\(t=1\\) to \\(t=9\\), move up (action U) each turn to reach \\(y=9\\) as quickly as possible while ensuring all intermediate positions are safe:\n  - \\(y=1\\) at \\(t=2\\): Safe (unsafe only at \\(t=1\\)).\n  - \\(y=2\\) at \\(t=3\\): Safe (unsafe only at \\(t=0\\)).\n  - \\(y=3\\) at \\(t=4\\): Safe (unsafe only at \\(t=0\\)).\n  - \\(y=4\\) at \\(t=5\\): Safe (unsafe only at \\(t=2\\)).\n  - \\(y=5\\) at \\(t=6\\): Safe (unsafe only at \\(t=2\\)).\n  - \\(y=6\\) at \\(t=7\\): Safe (unsafe at \\(t=8\\) and \\(t=9\\), not \\(t=7\\)).\n  - \\(y=7\\) at \\(t=8\\): Safe (unsafe at \\(t=0,1,2\\), not \\(t=8\\)).\n  - \\(y=8\\) at \\(t=9\\): Safe (unsafe at \\(t=16-19\\), not \\(t=9\\)).\n- Reach \\(y=9\\) at turn \\(t=10\\) (safe, not a freeway).\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in \\(H=10\\) turns, which is minimal because moving up immediately at turn \\(t=0\\) would place the player on \\(y=1\\) at turn \\(t=1\\), causing a collision.

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 1, and the player is at (0,0). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions.\n\nThe grid has freeways y=1 to y=8. On each freeway, there are cars moving either left or right at constant speeds. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S) at each turn. The vertical position is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y_T (i.e., the player's y-coordinate at turn T is k, which is between 1 and 8) and at the same time the player's x-coordinate (which is always 0) lies within the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nNote: When the player moves from y to y' at turn T, at the moment of turn T they are still on y, and then they move to y' for the next turn. So at turn T, the player is on y_T, and at turn T+1, they will be on y_{T+1}. Therefore, when moving from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T the player is on y and then at turn T+1 they are on y+1. This means that at turn T, we only check the cars on the current freeway y_T.\n\nWe are to output a sequence of actions starting at turn t1 (which is 1) for H turns until we reach y=9.\n\nLet's denote the current turn as t (starting at t1=1). We need to simulate the car positions at future turns.\n\nFirst, we note the car information for each freeway (k=1 to 8). We are given a list of cars on each freeway. For each car, we have (head, tail, direction, speed). Note that for left-moving cars, the head is the rightmost point and tail the leftmost? But the update rule says:\n\nFor left-moving: \n  Initially: [h, τ] (so h is the head, τ is the tail, and h > τ because it's moving left so the head is at a higher x than the tail? Actually, the update rule: \n    Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n  This implies that at time t1, the car covers from τ to h? But note: for a left-moving car, as time increases, both h and τ decrease.\n\nHowever, the problem states:\n  Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n  But note: if h is the head and τ the tail, and the car is moving left, then at time t1, the car occupies [τ, h] (if τ < h) and then moves left. However, the notation in the table is given as (head, tail). \n\nBut observe the example for freeway 1: (0, -47, right, 48). This is a right-moving car? The direction is 'right'. So for right-moving cars, the update is:\n  [τ, h] -> [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]   ??? \n\nWait, the update rule for right-moving is written as:\n  [Span(t1) = [τ, h] -> becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the table, the car on freeway 1 is given as (0, -47, right, 48). If we interpret the first number as head and the second as tail, then for a right-moving car, we would have at t1: [τ, h] = [-47, 0]. Then at time T, it becomes [-47 + 48*(T-1), 0 + 48*(T-1)].\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car, say freeway 4: (12, 47, left, 36). Then at t1: [h, τ] = [12,47]? But then the update: [12 - 36*(T-1), 47 - 36*(T-1)]. However, note that 12 < 47, so the span at t1 is [12,47]. Then as T increases, the car moves left.\n\nBut the collision condition is: at turn T, if the player is on freeway k at turn T, then we require that 0 is NOT in the span of any car on freeway k at turn T.\n\nSo for a freeway k at turn T, we have a list of cars. Each car has a span [a, b] (which is the interval from a to b, inclusive? Actually, it's a contiguous segment). The player is at x=0, so we need to check if 0 is in [a, b] for any car.\n\nNow, we have to simulate the movement of the player and check for collisions at each turn until we reach y=9.\n\nWe are to find the minimal H and the sequence of actions.\n\nWe start at turn 1: y1 = 0. We are at (0,0). Since y=0 is not a freeway (freeways are 1..8), we don't check for collision at y=0. Similarly, at the goal y=9, we don't have cars. So we only care about freeways 1 to 8.\n\nWe can use BFS (breadth-first search) over the state: (turn, y). However, note that the turn can be large? But the minimal H might be small. Also, the car movements are linear and periodic? Actually, we can compute the car positions at any turn T.\n\nAlternatively, we can simulate turn by turn, keeping track of the current y and the current turn (relative to t1=1). We are to minimize H, so we can do a BFS that explores by the number of turns.\n\nThe state: (t, y) where t is the current turn (starting at t1=1) and y is the current vertical position (0..9). We want to reach y=9.\n\nAt each state (t,y), we can choose an action a in {U, D, S}. Then the next state is (t+1, y') where:\n  if a = U: y' = min(y+1, 9) [but note: if y is 9, then U would leave it at 9? Actually, the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta, and we clamp to [0,9]. So if y=9, U would try to go to 10 -> clamped to 9. Similarly, D from 0 would stay 0.\n\nBut note: we are starting at y=0 at turn 1. We want to reach (0,9) at some turn H (so at turn H, we are at y=9). We are free to move beyond 9? Actually, no: the update says y_{t+1} is clamped to [0,9]. So we can only be at 0..9.\n\nHowever, we must avoid being on a freeway (y from 1 to 8) at turn t if at that turn there is a car on that freeway that has 0 in its span.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway k and for any turn T (>= t1) the set of x=0 that is covered by any car on freeway k at turn T.\n\nBut note: the cars on a freeway are independent. For each freeway k, we have a set of cars. For each car, we can compute the interval [a_T, b_T] at turn T.\n\nThen, at turn T, freeway k is dangerous if there exists at least one car on k such that 0 is in [a_T, b_T]. Otherwise, it is safe.\n\nSo for each freeway k and for each turn T (starting from 1), we can precompute whether it is safe to be on k at turn T.\n\nBut note: the turns we are going to simulate might be up to ...? How many turns do we need? Since we start at 0 and want to get to 9, the minimal number of moves without any cars is 9 moves (all U). But with cars, we might have to wait or detour. So H might be at least 9, but could be more.\n\nWe can precompute the safety for each freeway k for a range of turns, say from turn 1 to, for example, 100? Since the speeds and initial positions are given, and we are only concerned about when the car spans cover 0.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the condition for a car to cover 0 at turn T.\n\nFor a car on freeway k:\n\nFor a right-moving car: \n  initial at t1: [τ, h] -> at T: [τ + s*(T-1), h + s*(T-1)]\n  We require 0 to be in [τ + s*(T-1), h + s*(T-1)] \n  => τ + s*(T-1) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-1)\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car:\n  initial: [h, τ] -> at T: [h - s*(T-1), τ - s*(T-1)]\n  Note: in the update, the head becomes h - s*(T-1) and the tail becomes τ - s*(T-1). But since the car is moving left, and originally [h, τ] with h being the head (so h is the rightmost, and τ the leftmost? Actually, no: in the update, the head is the one that was at h at t1, and then moves to h - s*(T-1). But the span becomes [h - s*(T-1), τ - s*(T-1)]. However, if h < τ, then the interval [h, τ] is backwards? Actually, the problem states the span as [head, tail] for left, but we must interpret the interval as the entire segment? I think the representation is such that the car occupies an interval from min(head, tail) to max(head, tail)? \n\nWait, the update rule for left-moving: \n  [h, τ] -> [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\nBut if at t1, the car is from h to τ, and if h < τ, then the car is from h to τ? Then moving left, the entire segment moves left. But the problem doesn't specify the order. However, the collision condition is: 0 in [a, b] meaning the entire continuous interval from a to b.\n\nSo for a left-moving car, at turn T, the car occupies the interval [min(h - s*(T-1), τ - s*(T-1)), max(h - s*(T-1), τ - s*(T-1))]. Similarly for right.\n\nBut note the initial representation: for freeway 4: (12, 47, left, 36). Here, head=12, tail=47. Then at t1, the car is from 12 to 47? Then moving left, at T: [12 - 36*(T-1), 47 - 36*(T-1)]. But note that 12-36*(T-1) might be less than 47-36*(T-1)? Actually, 12 < 47, so the interval at T is [12-36*(T-1), 47-36*(T-1)]. This is increasing? Then 0 is in the interval if:\n  12 - 36*(T-1) <= 0 <= 47 - 36*(T-1)\n\nBut wait, if T-1 is large enough, then 12-36*(T-1) becomes negative and 47-36*(T-1) also becomes negative. But if T-1 is 0, then [12,47] and 0 is not in [12,47]. \n\nSimilarly, for a right-moving car: freeway 1: (0, -47, right, 48). Then at t1: the car is from τ=-47 to h=0? Then at T: [-47 + 48*(T-1), 0 + 48*(T-1)]. So at T=1: [-47,0]. Then 0 is in the interval? Yes, because -47<=0<=0. So at turn 1, freeway 1 is dangerous? But the player is not on freeway 1 at turn 1? The player is at y=0 at turn 1.\n\nBut if the player were to be on freeway 1 at turn 1, then it would be a collision. However, at turn 1, the player is at y=0, which is safe.\n\nSo we need to precompute for each freeway k and for each turn T (>=1) the danger: safe (0 not covered) or not.\n\nLet's compute for each freeway the set of turns T at which the freeway is dangerous.\n\nFreeway 1: \n  Car: (head=0, tail=-47, direction='right', speed=48)\n  This is a right-moving car, so at turn T: \n      left end = -47 + 48*(T-1)\n      right end = 0 + 48*(T-1)\n  We need to know if 0 is in [left, right] i.e., \n      -47 + 48*(T-1) <= 0 <= 48*(T-1)\n  Solve: \n      For the left inequality: -47 + 48*(T-1) <= 0 -> 48*(T-1) <= 47 -> T-1 <= 47/48 -> T <= 1 + 47/48 -> T<=1 (since T is integer, T=1: then -47<=0 -> true) and T=2: -47+48=1>0 -> false.\n      For the right inequality: 0 <= 48*(T-1) -> T-1>=0 -> T>=1.\n  So at T=1: 0 is in [-47,0] -> dangerous.\n      T=2: [1, 48] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n      T=3: [49, 96] -> safe.\n      ... and then the car moves away to the right.\n\n  Therefore, freeway 1 is dangerous only at T=1.\n\nFreeway 2: two cars.\n  First car: (60,49,right,12) -> but wait, the head is 60 and tail 49? For a right-moving car, we are given (head, tail) and then the update uses [τ, h]? The problem says: for right-moving, the initial span is [τ, h]. So if we are given (head, tail) = (60,49), then τ=49, h=60? Then the car at t1: [49,60]. Then at T: [49+12*(T-1), 60+12*(T-1)].\n\n  We need 0 in [49+12*(T-1), 60+12*(T-1)]?\n      49+12*(T-1) <= 0 <= 60+12*(T-1)\n      The left part: 49+12*(T-1) <=0 -> 12*(T-1) <= -49 -> impossible because 12*(T-1) is nonnegative for T>=1. So never.\n\n  Second car: (12,1,right,12). So τ=1, h=12? Then at T: [1+12*(T-1), 12+12*(T-1)].\n      Condition: 1+12*(T-1) <= 0 <= 12+12*(T-1)\n      The left: 1+12*(T-1) <=0 -> 12*(T-1) <= -1 -> impossible.\n\n  So freeway 2 is always safe.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? \n  Two cars: (60,49,right,12) and (12,1,right,12). Same as above -> always safe.\n\nFreeway 4: \n  Car: (12,47,left,36) -> left-moving. The update: [12-36*(T-1), 47-36*(T-1)]\n  Condition: 12-36*(T-1) <= 0 <= 47-36*(T-1)\n\n  Left inequality: 12-36*(T-1) <=0 -> 36*(T-1) >=12 -> T-1>=12/36=1/3 -> T>=2 (since T integer, T>=2).\n  Right inequality: 0<=47-36*(T-1) -> 36*(T-1)<=47 -> T-1<=47/36≈1.305 -> T<= floor(1.305)+1=2? Actually, T-1<=47/36 -> T<= 1+47/36=83/36≈2.305 -> so T<=2.\n\n  So T=2: \n      Left inequality: 12-36*1 = -24 <=0 -> true.\n      Right inequality: 47-36=11>=0 -> true.\n      So T=2: dangerous.\n\n  T=1: \n      Left: 12-0=12>0 -> false -> so not dangerous.\n      Actually, at T=1: the car is [12,47] -> 0 not in.\n\n  T=3: \n      Left: 12-36*2=12-72=-60<=0 -> true.\n      Right: 47-72=-25<0 -> false -> so 0 is not in the interval? \n          Actually, the interval at T=3: [12-72, 47-72] = [-60,-25]. 0 is not in that interval.\n\n  So only T=2 is dangerous.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 4? \n  Car: (12,47,left,36) -> same as above. Only dangerous at T=2.\n\nFreeway 6:\n  Car: (-42,-53,right,6) -> right-moving. So τ=-53, h=-42? Then at T: [-53+6*(T-1), -42+6*(T-1)]\n  Condition: -53+6*(T-1) <=0<=-42+6*(T-1)\n\n  Left: -53+6*(T-1)<=0 -> 6*(T-1)<=53 -> T-1<=53/6≈8.83 -> T<=9 (integer)\n  Right: 0<=-42+6*(T-1) -> 6*(T-1)>=42 -> T-1>=7 -> T>=8.\n\n  So T in [8,9]: \n      T=8: [-53+42, -42+42] = [-11,0] -> 0 is in? yes, because the interval is [-11,0] (and 0 is the right endpoint). So dangerous at T=8 and T=9? \n          At T=8: interval = [-53+6*7, -42+6*7] = [-53+42, -42+42] = [-11,0] -> 0 is in.\n          At T=9: [-53+48, -42+48] = [-5,6] -> 0 is in? yes, because -5<=0<=6.\n\n      T=10: [-53+54, -42+54] = [1,12] -> safe.\n\n  So dangerous at T=8,9.\n\nFreeway 7: two cars.\n  First car: (52,41,right,4) -> τ=41, h=52? Then at T: [41+4*(T-1), 52+4*(T-1)]\n      Condition: 41+4*(T-1)<=0<=52+4*(T-1)\n      Left: 41+4*(T-1)<=0 -> 4*(T-1)<=-41 -> impossible.\n\n  Second car: (4,-7,right,4) -> τ=-7, h=4. Then at T: [-7+4*(T-1), 4+4*(T-1)]\n      Condition: -7+4*(T-1)<=0<=4+4*(T-1)\n      Left: -7+4*(T-1)<=0 -> 4*(T-1)<=7 -> T-1<=7/4=1.75 -> T<=3 (T=1,2,3)\n      Right: 0<=4+4*(T-1) -> always true for T>=1.\n\n      So for T=1: [-7,4] -> 0 in? yes.\n      T=2: [-7+4,4+4] = [-3,8] -> 0 in? yes.\n      T=3: [1,12] -> 0 not in? \n          Actually: -7+4*2 = 1? -> -7+8=1, and 4+8=12 -> [1,12] -> 0 not in.\n\n      So dangerous at T=1 and T=2.\n\nFreeway 8:\n  Car: (-45,-56,right,3) -> τ=-56, h=-45. Then at T: [-56+3*(T-1), -45+3*(T-1)]\n      Condition: -56+3*(T-1)<=0<=-45+3*(T-1)\n      Left: -56+3*(T-1)<=0 -> 3*(T-1)<=56 -> T-1<=56/3≈18.66 -> T<=19\n      Right: 0<=-45+3*(T-1) -> 3*(T-1)>=45 -> T-1>=15 -> T>=16\n\n      So T from 16 to 19 inclusive: dangerous.\n\nSummary of dangerous freeways and turns:\n\nFreeway 1: T=1\nFreeway 2: never\nFreeway 3: never\nFreeway 4: T=2\nFreeway 5: T=2\nFreeway 6: T=8,9\nFreeway 7: T=1,2\nFreeway 8: T=16,17,18,19\n\nWe start at turn 1, y=0.\n\nWe want to get to y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nWe can use BFS in terms of the number of turns. We consider state (turn, y). The turn starts at 1 and we let it go until we reach y=9.\n\nThe transitions: at state (t, y), we can choose:\n  U: next state (t+1, min(y+1,9))\n  D: next state (t+1, max(y-1,0))\n  S: next state (t+1, y)\n\nBut we must avoid states where:\n  - if y is between 1 and 8 (inclusive) and the freeway y is dangerous at turn t.\n\nNote: at turn t, we are at y. Then we choose an action and then at turn t+1 we are at a new y. But the danger check for the current state (t,y) is: if y in [1,8], then we check if freeway y is dangerous at turn t.\n\nSo if we are at (t,y) and y in [1,8] and freeway y is dangerous at turn t, then we cannot be in that state.\n\nWe start at (1,0): safe because y=0 (not a freeway).\n\nGoal: any state (t,9) for some t. And we want the minimal t (i.e., minimal H = t - t1 + 1? Actually, we started at turn t1=1. After H-1 moves, we are at turn t1 + H - 1. We want to be at y=9 at that turn.\n\nBut note: the state (t,y) is at the beginning of turn t? Actually, the state at turn t is after the action of turn t-1? \n\nLet me clarify the timeline:\n\n- At turn t1 (which is 1), the player is at (0,y1) = (0,0). Then we choose action a_{1}.\n- Then we update to y2 = y1 + Delta(a1) -> then at turn 2, we are at y2.\n\nBut the collision at turn 1: we are at y1=0 -> not on a freeway -> safe.\nThen we take an action a1, and then at turn 2, we are at y2. Now, at turn 2, we are at y2 -> if y2 in [1,8], then we check freeway y2 at turn 2.\n\nSo the danger check for the state (t, y) happens at the beginning of turn t? Actually, the problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 is in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\". And at turn T, the player is at y_T. So at the moment of turn T, the player is at y_T, and that's when we check.\n\nTherefore, when we are at state (t, y), we are at turn t and position y. Then we choose an action for turn t. After we choose, we move to turn t+1 and a new y.\n\nBut the collision condition is checked at the state (t,y): if y is in [1,8] and the freeway y is dangerous at turn t, then we cannot be in that state.\n\nSo in BFS, we avoid expanding states that are dangerous.\n\nWe start at (1,0) -> safe.\n\nWe then consider the next actions: \n  U: next state (2,1) -> at turn 2, y=1 -> freeway 1. But at turn 2, freeway1 is safe? (we computed: freeway1 dangerous only at turn1). So safe.\n  D: (2,0) -> safe (y=0)\n  S: (2,0) -> safe\n\nBut wait: what about freeway7? At turn1, freeway7 is dangerous, but we are not on freeway7 at turn1. At turn2, we might be on freeway1? \n\nWe have to check the next state: (2,1) -> freeway1 at turn2: safe (only dangerous at turn1). So (2,1) is safe.\n\nSimilarly, (2,0) is safe.\n\nNow, from (2,1): \n  U: (3,2) -> at turn3, freeway2? freeway2 is always safe -> safe.\n  D: (3,0) -> safe.\n  S: (3,1) -> freeway1 at turn3: safe? freeway1 is only dangerous at turn1 -> safe.\n\nBut wait, freeway7 at turn2 is dangerous? Yes. So if we were to be on freeway7 at turn2, that would be bad. But at (2,1): we are on freeway1, not freeway7.\n\nWe need to avoid being on any freeway that is dangerous at that turn.\n\nNow, we want the minimal number of turns to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal without obstacles is 9 moves: all U. Then we would be at turn 10: \n  Turn1: y=0 -> safe.\n  Turn2: y=1 -> freeway1: safe? at turn2, freeway1 is safe -> yes.\n  Turn3: y=2 -> freeway2: always safe -> safe.\n  Turn4: y=3 -> freeway3: always safe -> safe.\n  Turn5: y=4 -> freeway4: at turn5, dangerous? we computed freeway4 only dangerous at turn2 -> safe.\n  Turn6: y=5 -> freeway5: dangerous at turn2 -> safe at turn6.\n  Turn7: y=6 -> freeway6: dangerous at turn8,9 -> turn7 safe.\n  Turn8: y=6 -> wait, no: we are moving each turn. So at turn8, we are at y=7? \n      Actually: \n          turn1: y=0\n          turn2: y=1\n          turn3: y=2\n          turn4: y=3\n          turn5: y=4\n          turn6: y=5\n          turn7: y=6\n          turn8: y=7 -> freeway7: at turn8, freeway7 dangerous? we computed freeway7 dangerous at turn1,2 -> safe at turn8.\n          turn9: y=8 -> freeway8: dangerous at turns 16-19 -> safe at turn9.\n          turn10: y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo the sequence: U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U -> 9 moves, H=10? But note: the number of turns from t1 to the goal: we start at turn1, and after 9 moves we are at turn10.\n\nBut the problem: we are to output the actions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1? Actually, we have H actions? \n\nThe problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}. And then we have y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nSo at turn1, we take a1 (t=0), then a2 (t=1), ... until a_{t1+H-1} = a_{1+H-1}. And at the end of these H actions, we are at turn1+H, and the position is (0,9).\n\nBut note: we start at turn1 at (0,0). After H actions, we are at turn1+H, and we want y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nSo in the above sequence, we start at turn1 (y=0), then:\n  turn1: a1=U -> y2=1 (at turn2)\n  turn2: a2=U -> y3=2 (at turn3)\n  ...\n  turn9: a9=U -> y10=9 (at turn10)\n\nSo H=9 actions? But then the last action is at turn9, and we are at turn10 at y=9. The problem says we must be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nWait: the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1: \n  t=0: a_{t1+0} = a1\n  t=1: a_{t1+1}=a2\n  ...\n  t=H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nThen the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, and then the state becomes y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Delta(a_{t1+H-1}).\n\nBut we want the position at turn t1+H-1? Actually, no: we want to have reached (0,9) at the end of the sequence, which is after the last action. So we want y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"? \n\nLet me read: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nBut note: the actions are taken at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. After the last action (at turn t1+H-1), we update to the next state at turn t1+H. So at turn t1+H, we are at y=9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\" — that would be before the last action. \n\nActually, the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nLet me check the problem statement: \n  \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd then in the update: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\n\nSo after the sequence of H actions (t=0 to H-1), the last update is from y_{t1+H-1} to y_{t1+H}. We want y_{t1+H} = 9? \n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nThat means at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9? But then we don't need to do an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut the sequence of actions is defined for t=0 to H-1, meaning the actions are taken at turns: t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. \n\nIf we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then we would not need to take an action at that turn? But the sequence requires an action for that turn. \n\nAlternatively, the state y_t is the state at the beginning of turn t? Then the action at turn t is taken and then we get y_{t+1}. \n\nThe problem says: \n  \"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\"\n\nSo at the beginning of turn t, we are at y_t. Then we choose a_t, and then we move to y_{t+1} at the beginning of turn t+1.\n\nTherefore, we want y_{t1+H} = 9? Then we don't need to specify an action for turn t1+H? \n\nBut the sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1, meaning we are specifying a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}. Then the state at turn t1+H is y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\" — that would be the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. \n\nI see a discrepancy. \n\nLooking back: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd then: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nSo it says: at turn t1+H-1, the player is at (0,9). \n\nBut the update: \n  at turn t1: we are at (0, y_{t1}) -> then we take a_{t1} -> then at turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Delta(a_{t1})\n\nSo to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, that means we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. Then we don't take an action at turn t1+H-1? But the sequence of actions is defined for t=0 to H-1, meaning we are taking actions at turns t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. \n\nThis implies that the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, and then we are at y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Delta(a_{t1+H-1}). \n\nBut we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9. \n\nSo the last action (at turn t1+H-1) must be chosen such that it does not move us away from 9? Since we are already at 9, we can choose S (or U/D but then clamped to 9). \n\nSo if we are at 9, we can choose S to stay at 9? But then the state at the next turn (t1+H) would still be 9. \n\nBut the problem requires that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. \n\nTherefore, we must have arrived at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action at that turn (which must be S, U, or D) and then we are still at 9 at turn t1+H? \n\nBut note: the goal is to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. So the action at turn t1+H-1 is part of the sequence, but we are already at 9 at the beginning of that turn. Then we can choose any action? However, if we choose U or D, we remain at 9 because of clamping. \n\nBut the minimal H: we want to minimize H, the number of turns (which is the number of actions). \n\nIn the straight path, we start at turn1: y=0. Then:\n  After 1st action (at turn1): we go to y=1 at turn2.\n  ...\n  After 8th action (at turn8): we go to y=8 at turn9.\n  Then at turn9: we take the 9th action: U -> we go to y=9 at turn10.\n\nBut then at turn9 we are at y=8, not 9. So we are at 9 at turn10.\n\nTo be at 9 at turn9 (the beginning of turn9), we would have to have been at 9 at the beginning of turn9. That means we must have arrived at 9 at the end of turn8? \n\nSo the minimal H would be 8? \n\nBut let's see: \n  Start at turn1: y1=0.\n  We want y9=9? (at the beginning of turn9) -> then we need to go from 0 to 9 in 8 moves? That would be 8 moves of U: \n      turn1: U -> y2=1\n      turn2: U -> y3=2\n      ...\n      turn8: U -> y9=8? -> not 9.\n\n  So we need 9 moves: \n      turn1: U -> y2=1\n      turn2: U -> y3=2\n      ...\n      turn9: U -> y10=9\n\nSo then we are at 9 at turn10. But the problem says we must be at 9 at turn t1+H-1 = 1+H-1 = H.\n\nWe want: at turn H, we are at 9? Then H=10.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\", meaning at turn (1+H-1)=H, we are at 9.\n\nSo we want to be at 9 at the beginning of turn H.\n\nTherefore, we need H-1 moves? Because we start at turn1, and after H-1 actions (at turns1 to H-1), we are at turn H at y=9.\n\nThe minimal H without obstacles is 10: because we start at turn1, and at turn10 we are at y=9 (after 9 moves).\n\nBut the problem says: minimal number of turns H. So H=10.\n\nAnd the sequence has 9 actions? Actually, the sequence has H actions? The index t from 0 to H-1 -> H actions.\n\nBut then the state after the last action (at turn1+H-1) is at turn1+H. And we want that state to be at y=9? But the problem says we want to be at y=9 at turn1+H-1.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me reexamine the problem statement: \n  \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd then: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nSo we require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, the player is at y=9.\n\nBut the sequence of actions is taken from t=0 to H-1, meaning we take actions at turns: t1+0, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nHow do we get to y=9 at turn t1+H-1?\n\nAt the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}. Then we take an action a_{t1+H-1} and then we move to y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Delta.\n\nBut we are not requiring anything about y_{t1+H}. We only require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9.\n\nSo the last action a_{t1+H-1} can be arbitrary? But we are already at 9, so we can choose S (or U/D, which will clamp to 9).\n\nHow many actions are taken? H actions. The first action is at turn t1, and the last at turn t1+H-1.\n\nWe start at turn t1=1: y1=0.\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t1+H = 1+H, but we want to be at y=9 at turn t1+H-1 = H.\n\nSo we need to go from 0 to 9 in H-1 moves? Because we start at turn1 and we have H actions, and after k actions we are at turn1+k and at position y_{1+k}. We require at turn1+H-1 (which is after H-1 actions) we are at y=9.\n\nTherefore, we need at least 9 actions to go from 0 to 9 (each action U moves up by one). So H-1 = 9 -> H=10.\n\nAnd then the sequence has 10 actions? But the index t from 0 to H-1: that's 10 actions? But then we are taking 10 actions, and the last action is at turn10. Then the state at the beginning of turn10 is y10, and then we take an action and go to y11. But we require y10=9.\n\nSo the 10 actions are taken at turns1 to 10. But then the state at the beginning of turn10 is after 9 actions? \n\nLet me write the turns and actions:\n\nTurn1: \n   state: y1=0\n   action a1 (t=0) -> then y2 = y1 + Delta(a1)\n\nTurn2: \n   state: y2\n   action a2 (t=1) -> then y3 = y2 + Delta(a2)\n\n...\n\nTurn10:\n   state: y10\n   action a10 (t=9) -> then y11 = y10 + Delta(a10)\n\nBut we require that at the beginning of turn10, y10=9.\n\nSo the actions a1 to a9 (which are taken at turns1 to 9) move us from y1=0 to y10=9.\n\nThat is, we have 9 actions (from a1 to a9) that move us from y1=0 to y10=9. Then we also have a10? But the sequence has H=10 actions: from t=0 to 9, so a1 to a10.\n\nBut then we are at y10=9 at the beginning of turn10, and then we take a10 and move to y11. But we don't care about y11. However, the requirement is only that at turn10 (which is t1+10-1 = 1+9=10) we are at 9.\n\nBut the action a10 is taken at turn10, and then we go to y11. But the requirement is met at the beginning of turn10, before taking a10.\n\nSo the action a10 can be anything? But the problem says we must output an action for turn10.\n\nSo to meet the requirement, we must have arrived at 9 by turn10 (the beginning of turn10) and then we can choose any action for turn10 (like S) to stay at 9 for y11.\n\nBut then the minimal H is 10, and we have 10 actions.\n\nAlternatively, could we get to 9 earlier? For example, at turn9? Then we would only need 8 moves? But we start at 0 and move up one per U, so to get to 9 we need 9 moves. So we can be at 9 at turn10 (after 9 moves).\n\nSo the minimal H is 10.\n\nBut in the straight path, we would do 9 U's and then one S? \n\nSequence for straight path (if no cars blocked):\n  Turn1: U\n  Turn2: U\n  ...\n  Turn9: U -> then at the beginning of turn10, we are at y10=9 (because after the 9th action at turn9, we go from y9=8 to y10=9).\n  Turn10: S (or U or D, doesn't matter) -> then y11=9.\n\nBut the requirement is that at turn10 (the beginning) we are at 9, which is satisfied.\n\nNow, with cars, we have to avoid being on a freeway that is dangerous at the turn we are on.\n\nIn the straight path, we go through:\n  turn2: y2=1 (freeway1) -> at turn2: freeway1 is safe? (only dangerous at turn1) -> safe.\n  turn3: y3=2 (freeway2) -> safe (always)\n  turn4: y4=3 (freeway3) -> safe\n  turn5: y5=4 (freeway4) -> at turn5: freeway4 is safe (dangerous only at turn2) -> safe.\n  turn6: y6=5 (freeway5) -> safe (only dangerous at turn2)\n  turn7: y7=6 (freeway6) -> at turn7: freeway6 dangerous at turn8,9 -> turn7 is safe.\n  turn8: y8=7 (freeway7) -> at turn8: freeway7 dangerous at turn1,2 -> safe.\n  turn9: y9=8 (freeway8) -> at turn9: freeway8 dangerous at turn16-19 -> safe.\n  turn10: y10=9 -> not a freeway, safe.\n\nSo the straight path is safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 10, and the sequence is:\n  Turn1: U\n  Turn2: U\n  Turn3: U\n  Turn4: U\n  Turn5: U\n  Turn6: U\n  Turn7: U\n  Turn8: U\n  Turn9: U\n  Turn10: S   (or U or D, but S is minimal change)\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=10.\n\nBut note: there might be a path with H=10 that is not straight? But since we want minimal H, and 10 is the minimal (because we need to go from 0 to 9, which takes at least 9 moves, so at least 10 turns including the start), then any safe path with 10 turns is minimal.\n\nSo we can output the straight path.\n\nBut let's verify the dangerous turns we might hit:\n\nAt turn2: freeway1 -> safe (only dangerous at turn1)\nAt turn8: freeway7 -> dangerous at turn1,2 -> so at turn8, safe? yes, because we computed freeway7 only dangerous at turn1 and 2.\n\nBut wait, freeway7 has two cars. We computed the second car is dangerous at turn1 and 2. At turn8, the second car is at: \n  [-7+4*(8-1), 4+4*(8-1)] = [-7+28, 4+28] = [21,32] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway8 at turn9: \n  Car: [-56+3*(9-1), -45+3*(9-1)] = [-56+24, -45+24] = [-32,-21] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo the straight path is safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 1: U\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: S\n}\n\nBut note: we have to output the actions for turns 1 to 10 (H=10, so t from 0 to 9: 10 actions). And the last action at turn10: we choose S to stay at 9.\n\nAlternatively, we could choose U or D and still be at 9. But S is fine.\n\nBut wait: is there a problem at turn10? We are at y10=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision. Then we take S -> stay at 9.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence of actions is to be provided for turns t1 to t1+H-1, which is turn1 to turn1+10-1=10.\n\nSo we output 10 actions.\n\nBut the minimal H is 10, and we have 10 actions.\n\nHowever, note that after the 9th action (at turn9) we are at y10=9, so at turn10 we are at 9. Then the 10th action (at turn10) is not necessary for reaching 9, but the problem requires a sequence of H actions and we must be at 9 at turn10 (the beginning of turn10). So we can choose any action at turn10.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and H is defined as the number of turns we are considering? Actually, the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence is for H actions. And we must be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 = 1+H-1 = H.\n\nSo H is the turn number at which we are at 9? But then we don't need to take an action after that? \n\nThis is still confusing.\n\nLet me read carefully: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence has H actions: from t=0 to H-1, so actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAnd then the requirement is: y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nThat means after the actions, at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9.\n\nBut the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, and then we are at the next state at turn t1+H. \n\nBut the requirement is about the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, which is before the action at that turn.\n\nSo actually, the actions we take are from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1, and they affect the states from turn t1+1 to turn t1+H.\n\nBut the requirement is that at turn t1+H-1 (before the last action) we are at 9.\n\nSo the last action (at turn t1+H-1) is taken when we are already at 9. \n\nHow many actions are taken? H actions. But the first H-1 actions are what get us to 9 at turn t1+H-1. The last action is taken when we are already at 9.\n\nTherefore, we only need 9 actions to get to 9, and then the 10th action is taken at turn10 (which is t1+9) when we are at 9.\n\nBut then the state at the beginning of turn10 is 9, and we take the 10th action and then we go to y11.\n\nBut the requirement is met at the beginning of turn10.\n\nSo minimal H: we want to minimize H, the number of actions. But we need at least 9 actions to move from 0 to 9. Then we also have to output an action for the 10th? \n\nThe problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence has exactly H actions. And we must be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\nLet t_f = t1+H-1 = 1+H-1 = H.\n\nWe want y_H = 9.\n\nThe number of actions from turn1 to turn H-1 is H-1 actions? \n\nBut the sequence is for turns: t1 to t1+H-1, which is turn1 to turn1+H-1 = 1 to H.\n\nSo we take actions at turns1,2,...,H.\n\nAnd then we require y_H = 9.\n\nHow many actions: H actions.\n\nHow many state updates: from y1 to y_{H+1}. But we require y_H = 9.\n\nThe updates:\n  y2 = y1 + Delta(a1)\n  y3 = y2 + Delta(a2)\n  ...\n  y_{H} = y_{H-1} + Delta(a_{H-1})   [this is the state at the beginning of turn H]\n  then we take a_H and then y_{H+1} = y_H + Delta(a_H)\n\nBut we require y_H = 9.\n\nSo the first H-1 actions (a1 to a_{H-1}) move us from y1=0 to y_H=9.\n\nThis requires exactly 9 moves of U. So H-1=9 -> H=10.\n\nThen we have 10 actions: a1 to a10. The first 9 are U, and the 10th can be S.\n\nAnd the state at the beginning of turn10 (which is H=10) is y10=9.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 10.\n\nAnd the straight path works.\n\nSo we output 9 U's and one S at the end.\n\nBut note: the last action (at turn10) is not necessary for reaching 9, but the problem requires H actions and we must be at 9 at the beginning of turn10.\n\nAlternatively, if we could be at 9 earlier, we might have a smaller H? \n\nFor example, can we be at 9 at the beginning of turn9? Then we would require y9=9. That would be after 8 moves? But we start at 0: 8 U's would get us to 8 at turn9. So we cannot be at 9 at turn9.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 10.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 1: U\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: S\n}\n\nWe choose S for the last action to avoid moving, but U or D would also work (clamped to 9).\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 1\\) is 10. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by moving upward consistently, as the straight path is safe given the car positions and their movements.\n\n### Verification of Safety:\n- **Freeway 1**: Dangerous at turn 1. The player is at \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1) at turn 2, which is safe.\n- **Freeway 2**: Always safe.\n- **Freeway 3**: Always safe.\n- **Freeway 4**: Dangerous at turn 2. The player is at \\(y = 4\\) at turn 5, which is safe.\n- **Freeway 5**: Dangerous at turn 2. The player is at \\(y = 5\\) at turn 6, which is safe.\n- **Freeway 6**: Dangerous at turns 8 and 9. The player is at \\(y = 6\\) at turn 7, which is safe.\n- **Freeway 7**: Dangerous at turns 1 and 2. The player is at \\(y = 7\\) at turn 8, which is safe.\n- **Freeway 8**: Dangerous at turns 16 to 19. The player is at \\(y = 8\\) at turn 9, which is safe.\n\nThe player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at the beginning of turn 10.

The goal is to reach (0,9), which is probably safe once you're there.\n\nThe player moves up, down, or stays with actions U, D, S. Each action changes y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nCars are on each freeway y=1 to y=8. For each freeway, there might be multiple cars, each defined by head, tail, direction, and speed. Direction is left or right, which I think means moving left or right on the x-axis, but since the player is always at x=0, we only care about when the car spans include x=0 at the turn when the player is on that y-level.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car whose span includes 0 at that exact turn T.\n\nImportant note: when you move to a new y, you are not on that new y until the next turn. So if at turn T you are on y_T, and you move to y_{T+1}, then at turn T, you are still on y_T, so you only check for cars on y_T at turn T. When you arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1, you check cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe car positions update linearly over time based on their speed and direction.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t1 = 2.\n\nPlayer starts at y=1 at turn 2.\n\nI need to go to y=9. Since y=9 is the top, and we start from y=1, we need to move up. The minimal number of turns should be at least 8, because from y=1 to y=9, that's 8 steps up, but we might need to wait or go down sometimes to avoid cars, which could increase H.\n\nBut we can also stay still, so H could be more than 8 if we have to wait.\n\nThe goal is to minimize H, so we should aim for as few turns as possible, meaning moving up as much as we can, but avoiding collisions.\n\nFirst, I need to simulate the car movements over time to know when it's safe to be on each freeway.\n\nThe car spans are given at turn t1=2.\n\nFor each car, the span is given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: left or right. For left-moving, head is larger, I think, but let's see the update rule.\n\nFrom the update:\n\nFor left-moving: at time t, span [h, τ], and at time T, it becomes [h - s(T-t), τ - s(T-t)]\n\nSince it's moving left, decreasing x.\n\nIn the span, for left-moving, it says Span(t1) = [h, τ], and then Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nBut for left-moving, if it's moving left, h should be greater than τ? In the example, for freeway 4: (-24, 11, left, 36)\n\n-24 and 11, with direction left. -24 is less than 11, but if it's moving left, the head should be on the right, I think. I'm confused.\n\nLet's look at the update rule carefully.\n\nIt says: for left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nBut in this notation, [h, τ] might not be in order; it could be that h and τ are such that h is the leading part.\n\nIn freeway 4, it has (-24, 11, left, 36). So h = -24, τ = 11? But -24 is less than 11, so [ -24, 11 ] is from left to right, but direction is left, meaning moving to decreasing x.\n\nAt time T, it becomes [ -24 - s(T-t1), 11 - s(T-t1) ]\n\nSince s>0, this span is shifting left, so the values decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the notation, for right-moving, it's given as (τ, h) or (h, τ)? Let's see the car state.\n\nIn freeway 2, for example: (-48, -59, right, 12), so here it's (head, tail) or what?\n\nThe header says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nBut for freeway 2: (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\n-48 and -59, with direction right.\n\nAccording to update, for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSo in this case, for the first car on freeway 2: (h, τ) = (-48, -59), but since direction is right, the span is [τ, h] = [-59, -48] because τ is tail, h is head, I think.\n\nLet's read: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" so [tail, head], which for right-moving, tail is left, head is right.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\", so head is right, tail is left for left-moving? I'm getting confused.\n\nFrom the update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so if [h, τ] is from high to low, it moves left.\n\nBut in the input, for left-moving, like freeway 4: (h, τ) = (-24, 11), so h=-24, τ=11, and since direction left, Span = [h, τ] = [-24, 11], but -24 < 11, so this is increasing, but for left-moving, it should be decreasing? No.\n\n[h, τ] with h and τ, if h < τ, then [h, τ] is from left to right, but for left-moving car, it should be moving towards left, so the head should be on the right.\n\nI think there might be inconsistency in notation.\n\nPerhaps [h, τ] is always the position of head and tail, and the order depends on direction.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's interpret based on the update rule.\n\nFor a left-moving car: at time t, the span is [head, tail], with head > tail (since moving left, head on right), and it moves left, so both decrease.\n\nIn freeway 4: (h, τ) = (-24, 11), direction left. -24 and 11, -24 < 11, so if head is -24 and tail is 11, that would mean tail is at 11, head at -24, which is left of tail, but for left-moving, head should be on the right.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nLet's look at the update directly.\n\nFor left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nFor the car to be moving left, if at T=t1, [h, τ], and s>0, then at T>t1, h - sΔT < h, τ - sΔT < τ, so the span shifts to smaller x, meaning left.\n\nBut for the values, in freeway 4, h = -24, τ = 11, so at t1=2, span is [-24, 11], which is from x=-24 to x=11. Since direction is left, it means the car is moving towards decreasing x, so from t1, it will move left.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nFor freeway 2 first car: (h, τ) = (-48, -59), direction right.\n\nFor right-moving, span is [τ, h] at t1, so [ -59, -48 ], because τ = -59, h = -48, so [ -59, -48 ], and it moves right, so increases.\n\nIn general, for any car, the span at time T is:\n\nIf direction left: [ h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1) ]\n\nIf direction right: [ τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1) ]\n\nAnd collision if player is on that freeway at turn T and 0 is within the span at that turn.\n\nNow, the player position at turn T is y_T.\n\nAt each turn, for the freeway y_T, we need to check if for any car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\nAlso, since the player moves at the same time, but the car positions are updated based on time, not on player action.\n\nNow, t1=2, current turn.\n\nPlayer at y=1.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars per freeway at t1=2.\n\nFreeway 1: only one car: (48, 1, right, 48)\n\nDirection right, so span at t1=2: [τ, h] = [1, 48]? No.\n\nCar is (head h, tail τ, direction, speed) = (48, 1, right, 48)\n\nFor right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h] = [1, 48] because τ=1, h=48.\n\nThen at time T, span is [1 + 48*(T-2), 48 + 48*(T-2)] = [1 + 48ΔT, 48 + 48ΔT] where ΔT = T - t1 = T - 2.\n\nFreeway 2: two cars: first (-48, -59, right, 12), second (24, 13, right, 12)\n\nFor first car: (h,τ) = (-48, -59), dir right, so span at t1: [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nAt T: [ -59 + 12*(T-2), -48 + 12*(T-2) ]\n\nSecond car: (24, 13, right, 12), span at t1: [τ, h] = [13, 24]\n\nAt T: [13 + 12*(T-2), 24 + 12*(T-2)]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? \"3 | (−48,−59,right,12),(24,13,right,12)\" so identical to freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: (−24,11,left,36)\n\nDir left, so span at t1: [h, τ] = [-24, 11]\n\nAt T: [ -24 - 36*(T-2), 11 - 36*(T-2) ]\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 4? \"5 | (−24,11,left,36)\" yes, identical.\n\nFreeway 6: (−36,−47,right,6)\n\nDir right, (h,τ) = (-36,-47), so span at t1: [τ, h] = [-47, -36]\n\nAt T: [ -47 + 6*(T-2), -36 + 6*(T-2) ]\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (56,45,right,4), and (8,−3,right,4)\n\nFirst car: (56,45,right,4), span at t1: [τ, h] = [45,56]\n\nAt T: [45 + 4*(T-2), 56 + 4*(T-2)]\n\nSecond car: (8,-3,right,4), span at t1: [τ, h] = [-3,8]\n\nAt T: [ -3 + 4*(T-2), 8 + 4*(T-2) ]\n\nFreeway 8: (−42,−53,right,3)\n\nDir right, (h,τ) = (-42,-53), span at t1: [τ, h] = [-53, -42]\n\nAt T: [ -53 + 3*(T-2), -42 + 3*(T-2) ]\n\nNow, for each freeway, we need to find when x=0 is covered by any car on that freeway at a given turn T.\n\nCollision if for that freeway at turn T, there is a car whose span contains 0.\n\nSince multiple cars, we need to check for each car.\n\nAlso, for freeways with multiple cars, we need to check all.\n\nNow, player starts at y=1 at turn 2.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal path would be to go up as fast as possible, but avoiding unsafe times on each level.\n\nSince we can stay or go down, we might need to wait.\n\nBut to minimize turns, we should only stay or go down if necessary.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, the times when it is unsafe, i.e., when there is a car covering x=0.\n\nSince turns are discrete, we can compute for each turn T and each freeway, whether x=0 is covered.\n\nBut T starts from t1=2 onwards.\n\nLet me define ΔT = T - 2, so at ΔT=0, T=2.\n\nFor freeway 1: at time T, span [1 + 48ΔT, 48 + 48ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 1 + 48ΔT <= 0 <= 48 + 48ΔT\n\nSince 1 + 48ΔT >0 for ΔT >=0, and 48 + 48ΔT >0 always, so 0 in span only if 1 + 48ΔT <= 0, but 1 + 48ΔT >=1 >0 for ΔT>=0, so never <=0. Thus 0 is never in the span for freeway 1. So freeway 1 is always safe? Let's see:\n\n1 + 48ΔT <= 0? 1 + 48ΔT >=1, so minimum is 1, which is greater than 0, so 0 < lower bound, so 0 not in [lower, upper] since lower >=1 >0. So yes, freeway 1 is always safe, no car covers x=0 at any time.\n\nBut at ΔT=0, [1,48], 0 not in it. Similarly for other times. So freeway y=1 is always safe.\n\nPlayer is on y=1 at turn 2, and it's safe.\n\nNow, we need to go to higher y.\n\nFreeway 2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: span at T: [ -59 + 12ΔT, -48 + 12ΔT ]\n\n0 in span if -59 + 12ΔT <= 0 <= -48 + 12ΔT\n\nSimilarly, second car: [13 + 12ΔT, 24 + 12ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 13 + 12ΔT <= 0 <= 24 + 12ΔT\n\nNow, 13 + 12ΔT >=13 >0, so 0 <= 13 + 12ΔT always false, so second car never covers 0.\n\nFirst car: -59 + 12ΔT <= 0 <= -48 + 12ΔT\n\nSolve inequalities.\n\n-59 + 12ΔT <= 0 => 12ΔT <= 59 => ΔT <= 59/12 ≈ 4.916, so ΔT <= 4 since integer? ΔT integer, T integer.\n\nΔT = T - 2, T turn number, integer.\n\nSo -59 + 12ΔT <= 0 => 12ΔT <= 59 => ΔT <= 59/12 = 4.916, so ΔT <= 4\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= -48 + 12ΔT => 48 <= 12ΔT => ΔT >= 48/12 = 4\n\nSo for first car, 0 in span if ΔT >=4 and ΔT <=4, so only when ΔT=4.\n\nΔT >=4 and ΔT <=4, so ΔT=4.\n\nThen at ΔT=4, T=6, span: lower = -59 + 12*4 = -59 + 48 = -11, upper = -48 + 12*4 = -48 + 48 =0, so [ -11, 0 ], and 0 <=0 is true, so 0 included.\n\nAt other times, not.\n\nSecond car never, so freeway 2 unsafe only at T=6.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3 is identical to freeway 2, so same, unsafe only at T=6.\n\nNow freeway 4: left-moving, (h,τ)=(-24,11), dir left, s=36\n\nSpan at T: [ -24 - 36ΔT, 11 - 36ΔT ]\n\n0 in span if -24 -36ΔT <= 0 <= 11 -36ΔT\n\nNow, -24 -36ΔT <= 0 => -36ΔT <= 24 => ΔT >= -24/36 = -2/3, but ΔT >=0, so always true.\n\n0 <= 11 -36ΔT => 36ΔT <= 11 => ΔT <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305, so ΔT <=0 since ΔT integer >=0.\n\nΔT=0: at T=2, span [ -24, 11], 0 in it? -24 <=0<=11, yes 0 is between -24 and 11.\n\nFor ΔT=0, -24 -0 = -24, 11 -0=11, so [ -24, 11], 0 in it.\n\nFor ΔT=1, [ -24-36, 11-36] = [-60, -25], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for higher ΔT, more negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe only at ΔT=0, T=2.\n\nBut at T=2, player is on y=1, not y=4, so for freeway 4, it is unsafe at T=2, but we are not on it at that time.\n\nFreeway 4 is y=4, I assume? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so freeway k means y=k.\n\nIn the table, freeway k, so y=k.\n\nSo for y=4, unsafe at T=2 only? At T=2, ΔT=0.\n\nNow for ΔT=0, unsafe, but at other times safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5 same as freeway 4, so y=5 unsafe only at T=2.\n\nBut T=2 is current turn, player on y=1.\n\nNow freeway 6: ( -36, -47, right, 6)\n\nDir right, (h,τ)=(-36,-47), so span at T: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-47 + 6ΔT, -36 + 6ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -47 + 6ΔT <= 0 <= -36 + 6ΔT\n\n-47 + 6ΔT <= 0 => 6ΔT <= 47 => ΔT <= 47/6 ≈ 7.833, so ΔT <=7\n\n0 <= -36 + 6ΔT => 36 <= 6ΔT => ΔT >= 6\n\nSo for ΔT >=6 and ΔT <=7, i.e., T=8 and T=9? ΔT= T-2\n\nΔT >=6 and ΔT <=7, so ΔT=6 or 7, T=8 or 9.\n\nAt ΔT=6, T=8: lower = -47 + 36 = -11? -47 + 6*6 = -47+36= -11, upper= -36+36=0, so [ -11,0], 0 included.\n\nAt ΔT=7, T=9: lower= -47+42= -5, upper= -36+42=6, so [ -5,6], 0 in it.\n\nAt ΔT=8, T=10: lower= -47+48=1, upper= -36+48=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe at T=8 and T=9.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (56,45,right,4), span at T: [45 + 4ΔT, 56 + 4ΔT]\n\n0 in span? 45 +4ΔT >=45>0, so never <=0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSecond car: (8,-3,right,4), span: [-3 +4ΔT, 8 +4ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -3 +4ΔT <= 0 <= 8 +4ΔT\n\n-3 +4ΔT <= 0 => 4ΔT <=3 => ΔT <= 0.75, so ΔT <=0 since integer.\n\n0 <= 8 +4ΔT always true for ΔT>=0.\n\nSo at ΔT=0, T=2: span [-3,8], 0 in it.\n\nAt ΔT=1, T=3: [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe only at T=2 for second car.\n\nFirst car never unsafe.\n\nSo freeway 7 unsafe only at T=2.\n\nNow freeway 8: (-42,-53,right,3)\n\nSpan: [ -53 +3ΔT, -42 +3ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -53 +3ΔT <= 0 <= -42 +3ΔT\n\n-53 +3ΔT <= 0 => 3ΔT <=53 => ΔT <= 53/3 ≈17.666, so ΔT <=17\n\n0 <= -42 +3ΔT => 42 <= 3ΔT => ΔT >= 14\n\nSo for ΔT >=14 and ΔT <=17, T=16 to 19? ΔT=14,15,16,17.\n\nT=2 + ΔT, so T=16,17,18,19.\n\nAt ΔT=14, T=16: lower= -53+42= -11, upper= -42+42=0, [ -11,0]\n\nAt ΔT=15, T=17: lower= -53+45= -8, upper= -42+45=3, [ -8,3] includes 0\n\nAt ΔT=16, T=18: lower= -53+48= -5, upper= -42+48=6, [ -5,6]\n\nAt ΔT=17, T=19: lower= -53+51= -2, upper= -42+51=9, [ -2,9]\n\nAt ΔT=18, T=20: lower= -53+54=1, upper= -42+54=12, [1,12] no 0.\n\nSo unsafe at T=16,17,18,19.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, unsafe turns:\n\ny=1: always safe\n\ny=2: unsafe at T=6\n\ny=3: unsafe at T=6\n\ny=4: unsafe at T=2\n\ny=5: unsafe at T=2\n\ny=6: unsafe at T=8,9\n\ny=7: unsafe at T=2\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=16,17,18,19\n\nPlayer starts at turn 2, y=1, which is safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so always safe.\n\nThe minimal H: since from y=1 to y=9, at least 8 steps up.\n\nBut we might need to wait if we arrive at a freeway when it's unsafe.\n\nSince we can move at each turn, we need to plan a sequence of actions.\n\nStart at t=2, y=1.\n\nAction at t=2: we can go U to y=2, D to y=0, or S stay y=1.\n\nBut y=1 is safe, but we need to go up.\n\nIf we go U at t=2, we move to y=2 at turn t=3? Let's see the update.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t based on action at t.\n\nAt turn t, we take action a_t, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo at turn t, position is y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = new position for turn t+1.\n\nIn terms of when we are on a freeway.\n\nAt turn T, we are on y_T, and we check collision for y_T at that turn.\n\nThen we take action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nStart: turn 2, y=1.\n\nWe take action a_2, which will set y_3.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, to minimize turns, we want to go up as much as possible.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on unsafe freeways at unsafe times.\n\nPossible to go directly up if no conflicts.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nFrom y=1 to y=2: we need to be on y=2 at some turn.\n\ny=2 is unsafe only at T=6, so safe at other times.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 unsafe only at T=6.\n\ny=4 unsafe at T=2, but T=2 is past, we are at T=2 on y=1, not on y=4.\n\ny=4 unsafe only at T=2, and for T>2, it is safe, since only unsafe at T=2.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 unsafe only at T=2, safe for T>2.\n\ny=6 unsafe at T=8 and 9.\n\ny=7 unsafe only at T=2, safe for T>2.\n\ny=8 unsafe at T=16-19.\n\nNow, we start at T=2, y=1.\n\nWe can go up to y=2 at next turn.\n\nIf we go U at t=2, then y_3 = y_2 +1 =1+1=2? y_2=1, action a_2=U, then y_3 = y_2 +1 =2.\n\nAt turn t=3, we are on y=2.\n\nNow, y=2 is safe except at T=6. At T=3, is it safe? T=3, ΔT=1, from earlier, y=2 unsafe only at T=6, so at T=3, safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can continue up.\n\nBut let's list the turns we need to be on each y.\n\nSince we move one step per turn, the time we arrive at a y-level depends on when we leave y=1.\n\nDefine the turn when we are on each y.\n\nStart at T=2 on y=1.\n\nAfter that, we move to higher or lower.\n\nBut to minimize time, we should go up.\n\nSuppose we always go up when possible.\n\nStart T=2, y=1, safe.\n\nAction a_2: U, then y_3=2.\n\nTurn T=3, on y=2. Now y=2 safe at T=3? Yes, since unsafe only at T=6.\n\nAction a_3: U, then y_4=3.\n\nTurn T=4, on y=3. y=3 unsafe only at T=6, so at T=4, safe.\n\nAction a_4: U, then y_5=4.\n\nTurn T=5, on y=4. y=4 unsafe only at T=2, which is past, so safe at T=5.\n\nAction a_5: U, then y_6=5.\n\nTurn T=6, on y=5. Now y=5 unsafe at T=2, but T=6>2, so safe? y=5 unsafe only at T=2, so for T=6, it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, action a_6: U, then y_7=6.\n\nTurn T=7, on y=6. y=6 unsafe at T=8 and 9, not at T=7, so safe.\n\nAction a_7: U, then y_8=7.\n\nTurn T=8, on y=7. y=7 unsafe only at T=2, so at T=8, safe.\n\nAction a_8: U, then y_9=8.\n\nTurn T=9, on y=8. Now y=8 unsafe at T=16-19, not at T=9, so safe? T=9, ΔT=7, from earlier, unsafe starts at T=16, which is later.\n\nT=9, ΔT= T-2=7, for y=8, unsafe from T=16 to19, T=9 is before, so safe.\n\nAction a_9: U, then y_10=9.\n\nTurn T=10, on y=9, which is safe, and we reach goal.\n\nIn this sequence, we used actions from t=2 to t=9, that's 8 actions: U at each turn from t=2 to t=9, and we reach y=9 at turn t=10.\n\nt=10: y=9.\n\nNow, turns: we took actions at t=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, that's 8 turns? H is the number of actions, I think.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=2 to t=2+H-1, and after H actions, we are at y=9.\n\nIn this case, at t=2, we start, after action a_2, y_3=2, ..., after a_9, y_10=9.\n\nSo we took actions at t=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, that's 8 actions, H=8, and we reach at turn t=10.\n\nBut at each step, was it safe?\n\nWe need to check for each turn, when we were on a freeway, it was safe.\n\nTurn T=2: on y=1, safe.\n\nT=3: on y=2, safe (since unsafe only at T=6)\n\nT=4: on y=3, safe (unsafe only at T=6)\n\nT=5: on y=4, safe (unsafe only at T=2)\n\nT=6: on y=5, safe (unsafe only at T=2)\n\nT=7: on y=6, safe? y=6 unsafe at T=8 and 9, T=7 not unsafe, so safe.\n\nT=8: on y=7, safe (unsafe only at T=2)\n\nT=9: on y=8, safe? y=8 unsafe from T=16-19, T=9 is fine.\n\nThen T=10: on y=9, safe.\n\nSo all safe, and H=8 actions.\n\nBut is this minimal? H=8 is the minimum possible since we need 8 moves up.\n\nWe didn't have to wait or go down.\n\nBut let's confirm the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, at T=6, we were on y=5, which is safe.\n\ny=2 and y=3 unsafe at T=6, but we were not on them at T=6; we were on y=5 at T=6.\n\nIn the sequence: at T=6, we are on y=5.\n\ny=5 is safe at T=6.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut earlier I thought about y=6 unsafe at T=8 and 9.\n\nAt T=7, we were on y=6, which is safe at T=7.\n\nAt T=8, we were on y=7, not on y=6.\n\nAt T=8, y=6 is unsafe, but we are not on y=6 at T=8; we are on y=7.\n\nSimilarly, at T=9, we are on y=8, not on y=6.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nThus, we can go directly up in 8 moves.\n\nBut the car states might have multiple cars, but in this case, it seems fine.\n\nBut let's double-check freeway 6 at T=7.\n\ny=6 at T=7: T=7, ΔT=5, span for y=6: [ -47 +6*5, -36 +6*5] = [ -47+30, -36+30] = [-17, -6], so [ -17, -6], which is all negative, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nAt T=8, y=6 unsafe, but we are not on it.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,1) at turn t1=2, and after 8 actions, at turn 10, position (0,9).\n\nThe sequence: actions at turn 2 to turn 9: all U.\n\nBut the action sequence is from t=2 to t=2+H-1.\n\nH=8, so actions at t=2 to t=9.\n\nIn the answer, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U (since t1=2)\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1+1} = U (t=3)\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 +7: a_{t_1+7} = U (t=9)\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so t from 0 to 7, actions at t_1 + t.\n\nFor t=0, action at t_1 +0 = t1\n\nt=1, t1+1, ..., up to t=H-1, t1 + H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t1 + H, position should be (0,9).\n\nIn this case, t1=2, H=8, after actions at t=2 to t=9, at turn t=10, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut is there a problem at turn 9? We are on y=8 at turn 9, which is safe, as above.\n\nBut let's confirm y=8 at T=9.\n\ny=8: car span at T=9, ΔT=7, [ -53 +3*7, -42 +3*7] = [ -53+21, -42+21] = [-32, -21], all negative, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but in the car state, for freeway 2 and 3, unsafe at T=6, but we avoided it.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), which we do.\n\nBut is there a shorter way? H=8 is minimal, so no.\n\nBut we could reach faster? No, from y=1 to y=9, need at least 8 up moves, so H at least 8.\n\nHere we achieved in H=8.\n\nBut in the sequence, we used only U actions.\n\nBut let's make sure about the starting point.\n\nAt turn t=2, position (0,1), we take action U, so at t=3, position (0,2), and so on.\n\nCollision: at each turn, we are on the y-level, and check if 0 in car span for that y at that turn.\n\nIn all cases above, it was safe.\n\nBut for example, at turn 6, we are on y=5, which has cars, but unsafe only at T=2, so at T=6, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I should write the sequence.\n\nBut the answer should be the actions.\n\nBut in the car list, freeway 1 has a car, but we saw it never covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut freeway 7 at T=2 is unsafe, but we are not on it at T=2; we are on y=1.\n\nSo all good.\n\nThus, minimal H=8 with all U actions.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", which is 8, and the sequence.\n\nBut let's see if we can do it in less, impossible.\n\nPerhaps by going down to y=0 and up, but that would take more turns, since y=0 is safe but moving down then up adds extra moves.\n\nFor example, if we go down to y=0 at some point, we need to come back, so H>8.\n\nSimilarly, staying also increases H.\n\nSo H=8 is minimal.\n\nThus, the sequence should be all U for 8 turns.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nt1=2.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nAfter that, at turn 10, y=9.\n\nActions from turn 2 to turn 9.\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to 7 for the actions.\n\nBut in the box, it should be listed as:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 +1} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 + 7: a_{t_1 +7} = U\n\nSince H=8, actions at t_1 to t_1 +7.\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to 7.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the freeway, for y=4 and y=5, at T=2 they are unsafe, but since we start at y=1, not on them, and we pass later when safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at T=2 unsafe, but we are on it at T=8, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check if at any point we might be forced to wait, but in this case, no.\n\nPerhaps the cars on multiple freeways, but since we are only on one y at a time, it's fine.\n\nSo I think this works.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\) is 8. The sequence of actions consists of moving up (U) at every turn from \\(t_1\\) to \\(t_1 + 7\\), ensuring the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(t_1 + 8 = 10\\).\n\n### Verification of Safety:\n- **Turn 2 (t_1)**: Player at \\(y = 1\\). Freeway 1 is always safe (no car covers x=0 at any turn).\n- **Turn 3**: Player at \\(y = 2\\). Freeway 2 is unsafe only at turn 6; turn 3 is safe.\n- **Turn 4**: Player at \\(y = 3\\). Freeway 3 is unsafe only at turn 6; turn 4 is safe.\n- **Turn 5**: Player at \\(y = 4\\). Freeway 4 is unsafe only at turn 2; turn 5 is safe.\n- **Turn 6**: Player at \\(y = 5\\). Freeway 5 is unsafe only at turn 2; turn 6 is safe.\n- **Turn 7**: Player at \\(y = 6\\). Freeway 6 is unsafe at turns 8 and 9; turn 7 is safe (span: [-17, -6], 0 not included).\n- **Turn 8**: Player at \\(y = 7\\). Freeway 7 is unsafe only at turn 2; turn 8 is safe.\n- **Turn 9**: Player at \\(y = 8\\). Freeway 8 is unsafe at turns 16–19; turn 9 is safe (span: [-32, -21], 0 not included).\n- **Turn 10**: Player at \\(y = 9\\), which has no cars and is always safe.\n\nThis sequence avoids all collisions, as the player is never on an unsafe freeway at an unsafe turn. Since moving directly up requires exactly 8 actions to increase \\(y\\) from 1 to 9, \\(H = 8\\) is minimal.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{7}\\) is:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 2: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: & U \\end{array} }",

The current turn is t_1 = 3, so we start at turn 3.\n\nThe player moves vertically: U for up (y+1), D for down (y-1), S for stay (y same). y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nCars are on freeways y=1 to y=8, each with their own lanes. Cars move horizontally, and collision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that y, there's a car where x=0 is within its span at that turn.\n\nImportant point: When you move to a new y, you are not on that y until the next turn. So if at turn T, you are on y_T, and you move to y_{T+1}, at turn T you are still on y_T for collision purposes. Only at turn T+1 are you on y_{T+1}.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn T based on the player's y_T and the car spans on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9, which is not a freeway, so no cars there. y=9 is safe.\n\nStarting at y=2 at turn 3. I need to get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H: since we start at y=2, we need to gain 7 units to get to y=9. Each U move increases y by 1, so theoretically, with 7 U moves, we could get there in 7 turns, but we have to avoid the cars on y=1 to y=8 during the path.\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no cars, so they are safe. But we start at y=2, which has cars? Freeways are y=1 to y=8, so y=2 is a freeway with cars.\n\nAt turn t_1=3, player is at (0,2), which is on freeway y=2.\n\nNow, I need to check for each freeway, the car positions at different turns to see when it's safe to be there.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars for each freeway from the table:\n\nFreeway k=1: one car: (head=96, tail=49, direction=right, speed=48)\n\nDirection right means it's moving right, so span increases to the right.\n\nThe update: for right-moving car, span at time T: [tail + s*(T-t_1), head + s*(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the problem, for right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)] where τ is tail, h is head.\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: [h - s*(T-t_1), τ - s*(T-t_1)]\n\nAnd collision if 0 ∈ Span(T) for that freeway at turn T.\n\nt_1 is current turn, which is 3.\n\nSo for any turn T >= t_1, we can compute the car spans.\n\nAlso, for freeways with multiple cars, we need to check all of them for that freeway.\n\nNow, let's list the cars for each freeway at t_1=3:\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): one car: head=96, tail=49, dir=right, speed=48\n\nSince dir=right, at time T, span = [τ + s*(T-3), h + s*(T-3)] = [49 + 48*(T-3), 96 + 48*(T-3)]\n\nCollision if 0 is between those, inclusive, I assume.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 (y=2): two cars:\n\nFirst car: head=-36, tail=-47, dir=right, speed=12\n\nSecond car: head=36, tail=25, dir=right, speed=12\n\nFor right dir, span is [τ + s*(T-3), h + s*(T-3)]\n\nFirst car: τ=-47, h=-36, s=12\n\nSo span(T) = [-47 + 12*(T-3), -36 + 12*(T-3)]\n\nSecond car: τ=25, h=36, s=12\n\nSpan(T) = [25 + 12*(T-3), 36 + 12*(T-3)]\n\nFreeway 3 (y=3): same as freeway 2? Let's see:\n\n\"3 | (-36, -47, right, 12), (36, 25, right, 12) |\"\n\nIt says the same as freeway 2. Probably a copy-paste or same situation.\n\nFreeway 4 (y=4): one car: (-60, -25, left, 36)\n\nLeft direction: so for left-moving, span(T) = [h - s*(T-3), τ - s*(T-3)] = [-60 - 36*(T-3), -25 - 36*(T-3)]\n\nBecause h is head, which for left-moving might be on the left, but in the notation, head and tail might indicate the ends.\n\nIn the car state, it says \"head h, tail τ\", and for direction, it specifies left or right.\n\nFor left-moving, the car is moving left, so the head is decreasing.\n\nIn the update rule: left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] -> Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t_1), τ - s*(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the problem: \"Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\n\nIn the initial state, for left-moving, Span(t_1) is given as [h, τ], with h and τ such that for left-moving, h is the left end, τ is the right end? Let's see the values.\n\nFor freeway 4: (-60, -25, left, 36), so at t_1, Span(t_1) = [h, τ] = [-60, -25]? But -60 to -25, with left direction, so moving left, so head at -60, tail at -25, but tail should be behind, I think.\n\nPerhaps head is the front when moving.\n\nIn the update, for left-moving, it moves left, so positions decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right, increase.\n\nFor collision, we care about when 0 is in the span.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nFreeway 5 (y=5): same as freeway 4? \"5 | (-60, -25, left, 36) |\" only one car, same as y=4.\n\nFreeway 6 (y=6): one car: (-30, -41, right, 6)\n\nDirection right, so at t_1, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-41, -30]? Let's see the notation.\n\nIn the car state: for right-moving, it says \"head h, tail τ\", but in the update, for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\n\nSo for freeway 6: head=-30? tail=-41, dir=right, speed=6\n\nSince dir=right, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-41, -30]\n\nThen at T, Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-3), h + s*(T-3)] = [-41 + 6*(T-3), -30 + 6*(T-3)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 (y=7): two cars: (60,49,right,4) and (12,1,right,4)\n\nFirst car: head=60, tail=49, dir=right, so Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [49,60]? τ=49, h=60\n\nSpan(T) = [49 + 4*(T-3), 60 + 4*(T-3)]\n\nSecond car: head=12, tail=1, dir=right, Span(t_1) = [1,12], Span(T) = [1 + 4*(T-3), 12 + 4*(T-3)]\n\nFreeway 8 (y=8): one car: (-39,-50,right,3)\n\nhead=-39? tail=-50, dir=right, so Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-50, -39]\n\nSpan(T) = [-50 + 3*(T-3), -39 + 3*(T-3)]\n\nNow, the player starts at turn 3, position y=2.\n\nWe need to move to y=9.\n\nSince we move one step at a time, the possible actions each turn: U, D, S.\n\nTo minimize turns, we probably want to go up as much as possible, but avoid being on a freeway when a car is at x=0.\n\nAlso, we can stay or even go down to wait, but that might increase H, so we should avoid if possible.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway y, at which turns T it is safe to be on that y, meaning that for that T, 0 is not in any car span on that freeway.\n\nSince the player is on y at turn T, we need for that y and T, no car has 0 in span.\n\ny is fixed for the freeway, T is the turn.\n\nFor each freeway k, we need the set of T where it is safe.\n\nT is integer, since turns are discrete.\n\nt_1=3, so T >=3.\n\nAlso, when we move, at turn T, we are on y_T, and we decide action to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nStart at T=3, y=2.\n\nFirst, let's find for each y, the dangerous times when 0 is in some car span.\n\nStart with y=1.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, right-moving, s=48.\n\nSpan(T) = [49 + 48*(T-3), 96 + 48*(T-3)]\n\nSet 0 ∈ [49 + 48*(T-3), 96 + 48*(T-3)]\n\nSo 49 + 48*(T-3) <= 0 <= 96 + 48*(T-3)\n\nSince the car is moving right, and positions are large, let's see when the left end is <=0 and right end >=0.\n\nFirst inequality: 49 + 48*(T-3) <= 0\n\n48*(T-3) <= -49\n\nT-3 <= -49/48 ≈ -1.0208, so T-3 <= -2 since integer? T-3 <= -1.0208, so T-3 <= -2? Let's solve.\n\n48*(T-3) <= -49\n\nDivide both sides by 48: T-3 <= -49/48 ≈ -1.02083\n\nSince T-3 integer, T-3 <= -2? -2 = -96/48 < -49/48? -96/48 = -2, -49/48 ≈ -1.02083, so -2 < -1.02083, so T-3 <= -2? Inequality: T-3 <= -49/48 ≈ -1.02083, so since T-3 integer, T-3 <= -2? -2 is less than -1.02083? No: -2 = -2.0 < -1.02083, so T-3 <= -2 implies T-3 <= -1.02083, but T-3 could be -1.\n\nSet k = T-3, integer k >=0? T>=3, k>=0.\n\nT>=3, so k = T-3 >=0.\n\nBut in the inequality, 49 + 48k <=0, so 48k <= -49, which is impossible for k>=0 since left side >=0, right side negative. 48k >=0, -49<0, so 48k <= -49 never true for k>=0.\n\nSimilarly, the other inequality: 0 <= 96 + 48k, which is 0 <= 96 + 48k, true for all k>=0.\n\nBut we need both: left end <=0 and right end >=0.\n\nHere left end 49+48k >=49 >0 for k>=0, so 0 is never <= left end since left end >=49>0, so 0 is never in the interval. Similarly, right end >=96>0.\n\nSo for freeway 1, at all times T>=3, the car span is positive and increasing, so 0 is never covered. Thus, freeway 1 is always safe.\n\nIs that right? Span starts at [49,96] at T=3, and moves right, so for all T, min span is 49+48*0=49>0, so yes, 0 is never in the span for y=1. So safe at all turns.\n\nNow freeway 2 (y=2): two cars.\n\nFirst car: span(T) = [-47 + 12k, -36 + 12k] where k=T-3\n\nSecond car: span(T) = [25 + 12k, 36 + 12k]\n\nk>=0.\n\nFirst car: [-47 +12k, -36 +12k]\n\n0 ∈ this if -47 +12k <=0 and -36 +12k >=0\n\n-47 +12k <=0 => 12k <=47 => k <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916, so k<=3\n\n-36 +12k >=0 => 12k >=36 => k>=3\n\nSo for k=3, both: k>=3 and k<=3.916, so k=3.\n\nWhen k=3, T-3=3, T=6.\n\nSpan: -47+36= -11? k=3, -47 +12*3 = -47+36= -11\n\n-36 +12*3= -36+36=0\n\nSo [ -11, 0], so 0 is included? -36+12k at k=3: -36+36=0, and since it's inclusive, 0 is in [ -11, 0], yes.\n\nSimilarly, for k=4, -47+48=1, -36+48=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nk=2, -47+24= -23, -36+24= -12, [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at k=3, T=6, first car has 0 in span.\n\nBut there is second car: [25+12k, 36+12k]\n\nFor k=0: [25,36], min=25>0\n\nk=1: [37,48], etc, all positive, so 0 never in this span.\n\nThus for y=2, only at T=6, the first car has span including 0, so dangerous at T=6.\n\nOther times safe.\n\nAt T=6, if player on y=2, collision.\n\nNow freeway 3 (y=3): same as y=2, since cars are identical.\n\n\"3 | (-36, -47, right, 12), (36, 25, right, 12) |\" same as y=2.\n\nSo similarly, dangerous only at T=6.\n\nNow freeway 4 (y=4): one car, left-moving: (-60, -25, left, 36)\n\nFor left-moving, Span(T) = [h - s*(T-3), τ - s*(T-3)] = [-60 - 36k, -25 - 36k] where k=T-3\n\n0 ∈ this if -60 -36k <=0 and -25 -36k >=0? Let's see.\n\nSince left-moving, span decreasing.\n\n-60 -36k <=0 => -36k <=60 => multiply by -1, reverse inequality, 36k >= -60, which is true since k>=0.\n\nEasier: 0 ∈ [a,b] if a <=0 and b>=0.\n\nHere a = -60 -36k, b= -25 -36k\n\na <=0: -60 -36k <=0 => -36k <=60 => divide by -36, reverse inequality: k >= -60/-36 = 60/36 = 5/3 ≈1.666, so k>=2 since integer? k>= ceil(1.666)=2\n\nb >=0: -25 -36k >=0 => -36k >=25 => multiply by -1: 36k <= -25, which is impossible for k>=0.\n\nb = -25 -36k <= -25 <0 for all k, so b <0 always.\n\nThus b <0, and a = -60-36k <0, so the interval is entirely negative, 0 not in it.\n\nSimilarly, for all k, the span is negative and decreasing, so 0 never covered. Thus freeway 4 always safe.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5 (y=5): same car, so always safe.\n\nNow freeway 6 (y=6): one car, (-30, -41, right, 6)\n\nDirection right, so Span(T) = [τ + s k, h + s k] = [-41 + 6k, -30 + 6k] with k=T-3\n\n0 ∈ [-41+6k, -30+6k]\n\nSo -41+6k <=0 and -30+6k >=0\n\nFirst: -41+6k <=0 => 6k <=41 => k <= 41/6 ≈6.833, so k<=6\n\nSecond: -30+6k >=0 => 6k >=30 => k>=5\n\nSo k>=5 and k<=6.833, so k=5 or 6.\n\nk=5: T=3+5=8, span: -41+30= -11, -30+30=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nk=6: T=9, span: -41+36= -5, -30+36=6, so [-5,6], 0 in it.\n\nk=7: -41+42=1, -30+42=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo dangerous at T=8 and T=9 for y=6.\n\nNow freeway 7 (y=7): two cars.\n\nFirst car: (60,49,right,4), so Span(T) = [49 +4k, 60+4k]\n\nAll positive, min 49>0, so 0 never in.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,4), Span(T) = [1 +4k, 12+4k] all positive, min 1>0, so always safe. No danger.\n\nFreeway 8 (y=8): one car (-39,-50,right,3)\n\nSpan(T) = [-50 +3k, -39 +3k]\n\n0 ∈ [-50+3k, -39+3k]\n\nSo -50+3k <=0 and -39+3k >=0\n\nFirst: -50+3k <=0 => 3k <=50 => k <= 50/3 ≈16.666, k<=16\n\nSecond: -39+3k >=0 => 3k >=39 => k>=13\n\nSo k>=13 and k<=16.666, so k=13,14,15,16\n\nT=3+k, so T=16,17,18,19\n\nBut we are starting from T=3, and we want to reach y=9 quickly, so T=16 might be too late, but we'll see.\n\nNow, summary of dangerous times for each freeway:\n\ny=1: always safe\n\ny=2: dangerous at T=6\n\ny=3: dangerous at T=6\n\ny=4: always safe\n\ny=5: always safe\n\ny=6: dangerous at T=8 and T=9\n\ny=7: always safe\n\ny=8: dangerous at T=16,17,18,19 but since we aim for min turns, we might not reach that far if we go fast.\n\nPlayer starts at T=3, y=2.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nPossible paths: we can move up, down, or stay.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, and we need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nAt each turn, we choose action to change y.\n\nThe position at turn T is y_T.\n\nWe start at T=3, y_3=2.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of actions from T=3 onwards, such that for each T, when we are on y_T, it is safe (no collision), and we reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nSince we move step by step, the minimal H to gain 7 in y, but with possible delays.\n\nThe fastest way is to go up every turn: actions U,U,U,U,U,U,U, so from y=2 to y=9 in 7 turns, so at T=10, y=9.\n\nT=3: y=2, after action U at T=3, y=3 at T=4? Let's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn T, we are at position y_T.\n\nWe choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + delta, with delta based on a_T.\n\nSo at turn T, we are on y_T, and we perform action a_T to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nCollision is checked at turn T based on y_T and the car spans at T.\n\nThen after action, at turn T+1, we are on y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nStart: at turn T=3, we are at y_3=2.\n\nWe need to reach y_T =9 for some T.\n\nThe turn when we first reach y=9, say at turn H, so we need y_H =9.\n\nThen the actions are from T=3 to T=H-1, since at T=H-1, we set y_H=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-2? Let's see.\n\nSuppose we start at turn t_1, position y_{t_1}.\n\nAfter H-1 actions, we have H turns: from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nAt turn t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter H-1 actions, we have reached turn t_1 + H-1.\n\nAnd at that turn, y_{t_1 + H-1} =9.\n\nActions: {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-2? t from 0 to H-2 for the actions.\n\nIn the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nSo actions from t = t_1 to t_1 + H-1, total H actions.\n\nAfter H actions, we have H state changes, so from turn t_1 to turn t_1 + H.\n\nStart: at turn t_1, position given.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, we go to turn t_1 +1, position based on a_{t_1}.\n\nGenerally:\n\n- At turn T, position y_T\n\n- Choose a_T, set y_{T+1} = y_T + delta(a_T)\n\n- Collision checked at turn T based on y_T and cars at T.\n\n- We want y_{T_final} =9 for some T_final = t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn the sequence, actions for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so H actions, leading to turn t_1 + H.\n\nTurn sequence: start turn t_1, after action a_{t_1}, at turn t_1+1, y_{t_1+1}, ..., after a_{t_1+H-1}, at turn t_1+H, y_{t_1+H}.\n\nBut we want to reach at turn t_1 + H -1? Inconsistency.\n\nRead carefully:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nReach at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nActions: {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so t from 0 to H-1, that's H actions: a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., a_{t_1+H-1}\n\nAfter these actions, at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1+H}.\n\nBut we want to reach at turn t_1 + H -1, which is before the last action? Confusing.\n\nPerhaps: after H-1 actions, we reach at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nLet's see the index.\n\nSuppose H is the number of turns from start to end.\n\nStart at turn t_1.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn t_1.\n\nAfter 1 action, at turn t_1+1.\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t_1 + k.\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at some turn, say turn T_final.\n\nThen the number of actions taken is T_final - t_1.\n\nThen H in the problem is the number of turns? It says \"minimal number of turns H\", and reach at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nSet T_start = t_1 =3.\n\nWe start at turn T_start, y_{T_start} =2.\n\nWe want to be at y_T =9 for some T >= T_start.\n\nThe turn when we first reach y=9 is T_final.\n\nThen the number of turns from start to end is T_final - T_start + 1? Turns involved: from T_start to T_final, that's (T_final - T_start + 1) turns.\n\nBut H is defined as the number such that we reach at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nSo let T_final = t_1 + H -1.\n\nThen H = T_final - t_1 + 1.\n\nActions: from t = t_1 to t_1 + H -1, which is from t_1 to T_final -1? t_1 + H -1 = t_1 + (T_final - t_1 +1) -1 = T_final.\n\nActions from t_1 to T_final.\n\nBut at turn T_final, we are at y_{T_final}, which is 9, so we don't need an action at T_final, we are already there.\n\nThe actions are for turns when we move to the next position.\n\nAt turn T, for T from t_1 to T_final -1, we choose action a_T to determine y_{T+1}.\n\nThen at turn T_final, we have y_{T_final} =9, and no action needed at T_final.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns t_1 to T_final -1.\n\nNumber of actions: (T_final - t_1)\n\nThen in the problem, H is such that we reach at turn t_1 + H -1, so T_final = t_1 + H -1.\n\nThen number of actions is (t_1 + H -1 - t_1) = H-1.\n\nAnd actions for t from t_1 to (t_1 + H -1) -1 = t_1 + H -2? Messy.\n\nFrom the action sequence: {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, so actions at times t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1.\n\nAfter these actions, at turn (t_1+H), y_{t_1+H}.\n\nBut we want to reach at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's define the turn when we first reach y=9.\n\nStart at turn 3, y=2.\n\nIf we go up every turn:\n\nAt T=3, y=2, action U, then at T=4, y=3\n\nT=4, action U, T=5, y=4\n\nT=5, action U, T=6, y=5\n\nT=6, action U, T=7, y=6\n\nT=7, action U, T=8, y=7\n\nT=8, action U, T=9, y=8\n\nT=9, action U, T=10, y=9\n\nSo at T=10, y=9, reached.\n\nT_final =10.\n\nNumber of turns from start to end: turns 3 to 10, 8 turns.\n\nH in problem: reach at turn t_1 + H -1 = 3 + H -1 = 2 + H\n\nSet equal to 10, so 2+H=10, H=8.\n\nActions: from T=3 to T=9, 7 actions: a3 to a9.\n\nSequence for t from 0 to H-1=7, a_{t1+t} for t=0 to7: a3 to a9.\n\nYes.\n\nMinimal H if no obstacles: from y=2 to y=9, need 7 up moves, so 7 actions, from T=3 to T=9, reaching at T=10, so H=8 turns? Turns: T=3 to T=10 is 8 turns, but we reach at T=10, which is turn t1 + H -1 =3 +8-1=10, yes.\n\nH=8 for min with no obstacles.\n\nBut with cars, we may need to avoid some turns.\n\nIn this path, we need to check for each turn T from 3 to 9, when we are on y_T, is it safe?\n\nAt T=3, y=2: from above, y=2 is dangerous at T=6, but T=3 is safe since not T=6.\n\nT=3: k=0, for y=2, at T=3, k=0, first car span [-47,-36], 0 not in, second [25,36], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nT=4, y=3 (after action at T=3)\n\nAt T=4, y=3: similarly, y=3 same as y=2, dangerous at T=6, T=4 k=1, safe.\n\nT=5, y=4: y=4 always safe.\n\nT=6, y=5: y=5 always safe.\n\nIn the sequence above: at T=6, we are at y=5, which is safe.\n\nT=6, y=5, action U, to y=6 at T=7.\n\nT=7, y=6: y=6 dangerous at T=8 and T=9.\n\nT=7: k=T-3=4, for y=6, dangerous at k=5,6 T=8,9.\n\nT=7 k=4, span [-41+24, -30+24] = [-17,-6], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen action U to y=7 at T=8.\n\nT=8, y=7: y=7 always safe, as we saw.\n\nAction U to y=8 at T=9.\n\nT=9, y=8: y=8 dangerous at T=16-19, not yet, T=9 k=6, span [-50+18, -39+18] = [-32,-21], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen action U to y=9 at T=10.\n\nBut at T=10, we are at y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision, and we reached.\n\nIn this path, at T=7, y=6 is safe, but at T=8, if we were on y=6, it would be dangerous, but in this path, at T=8 we are on y=7.\n\nSimilarly, T=9 on y=8 safe.\n\nSo this path seems safe and takes H=8 turns, reaching at T=10.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nFrom y=2 to y=9, min 7 up moves, so min T_final=10, H=8.\n\nBut perhaps we can start later or something, but since we want min H, 8 is min possible.\n\nBut in this case, with obstacles, it works.\n\nBut we have to be careful at T=6 for y=2 and y=3.\n\nIn this path, at T=6, we are on y=5, not y=2 or y=3, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=8 and T=9, we are not on y=6, so safe.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nStart T=3, y=2, safe, action U\n\nT=4, y=3, safe (since T=4 not 6), action U\n\nT=5, y=4, safe, action U\n\nT=6, y=5, safe, action U\n\nT=7, y=6, safe (T=7 not 8 or 9), action U\n\nT=8, y=7, safe, action U\n\nT=7 y=6, T=7 k=4, not dangerous, then action U to y=7 at T=8.\n\nT=8 y=7 safe, action U to y=8 at T=9.\n\nT=9 y=8, safe, action U to y=9 at T=10.\n\nReached at T=10.\n\nBut in the action sequence, we have actions from T=3 to T=9, all U.\n\nNow, the problem is to output the actions for the turns.\n\nBut is there a reason to go slower? Probably not, since we can go directly.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach earlier? From y=2 at T=3, after 6 actions, at T=9, y=8 if all U, but we need to reach y=9, so at T=10 min.\n\nUnless we start from higher, but we start at y=2.\n\nPerhaps we can go down to y=1 or something, but that might take more turns.\n\nFor example, if at T=6 we were on y=2, it would be dangerous, so we must not be on y=2 or y=3 at T=6.\n\nIn our path, we are on y=5 at T=6, fine.\n\nSimilarly, for y=6, dangerous at T=8 and T=9, so we must not be on y=6 at those turns.\n\nIn our path, at T=8 we are on y=7, at T=9 on y=8, so y=6 is not occupied at T=8 or T=9.\n\nAt T=7 we are on y=6, but T=7 is safe for y=6.\n\nSo all good.\n\nPerhaps we can move faster? But we can only move one step per turn, so 7 steps needed.\n\nUnless we are at y=9 earlier, but we start at y=2.\n\nSo min H=8.\n\nBut let's confirm if y=2 at T=3 is safe: yes.\n\nIn the action sequence, all U.\n\nBut the player might choose to stay or go down to avoid, but unnecessary here.\n\nPerhaps for other reasons.\n\nAnother thing: at the start, y=2, and we are at T=3, which is safe.\n\nNow, the answer should be actions from t1=3 to t1+H-1, but H=8, so actions from T=3 to T=3+8-1=10? t1+H-1=3+8-1=10.\n\nActions for t from 0 to H-1=7, so a_{3+0} to a_{3+7} = a3 to a9.\n\na3 to a9, 7 actions.\n\nAt T=10, we reach.\n\nIn the sequence, turn t1: a_{t1} = a3, turn t1+1: a4, ..., up to turn t1+6: a9? t from 0 to 6 for H=7? H=8, t from 0 to 7.\n\nt=0: turn t1+0=3, a3\n\nt=1: turn4, a4\n\n...\n\nt=6: turn9, a9\n\nt=7: turn10, a10? But at turn10, we are already at y=9, no action needed? But in the sequence, it includes a_{t1+H-1} = a_{3+7} = a10.\n\nBut at turn10, if we are at y=9, we don't need to move, but the action might be S or something, but we have reached.\n\nIn the definition, the actions are until we reach.\n\nPerhaps it's fine to have action at turn10, but since y=9, we can set a10=S or U, but U would go to y=10, which is invalid, since y<=9.\n\ny must be in [0,9], so if at y=9, action U would try to go to 10, but y_{T+1} = min(max(y_t + delta,0),9), I assume.\n\nIn the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + delta y_t, with y_{t+1} in [0,9], so it clamps.\n\nSo if at y=9, action U, y_{t+1} = min(10,9)=9.\n\nSimilarly, action D to 8, etc.\n\nBut in this case, to reach and stay, but we just need to reach at some turn.\n\nIn the sequence, for a10, if we set U, it stays at 9, or S, same.\n\nBut since we reach at turn10, we can have the actions up to a9 to go to y10=9.\n\nIn the action list, from a3 to a9.\n\na_{t1} to a_{t1+H-2} for reaching at t1+H-1.\n\nIn this case, with H=8, reach at turn t1+H-1=3+8-1=10.\n\nActions from t1 to t1+H-2=3 to 10-3? t1+H-2=3+8-2=9.\n\nSo actions a3 to a9.\n\nAt T=9, we do action a9=U, so y10= y9 +1, but y9=8, so y10=9.\n\nYes.\n\nIf we set a9=S, y10=8, not reached.\n\nSo we need a9=U.\n\nSimilarly, all actions U from a3 to a9.\n\nBut is there a problem with the cars?\n\nIn the path, we are on y=6 at T=7, which is safe, as span at k=4: [-41+24, -30+24]=[-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nAt T=8, we are on y=7, safe.\n\nBut at T=8, y=6 is dangerous, but we are not on it.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut let's list the positions:\n\nT=3: y=2, safe\n\nT=4: y=3, safe (T=4 not 6)\n\nT=5: y=4, safe\n\nT=6: y=5, safe\n\nT=7: y=6, safe (k=4, not dangerous)\n\nT=8: y=7, safe\n\nT=9: y=8, safe (k=6 for y=8, span [-50+18, -39+18]=[-32,-21], 0 not in)\n\nThen after a9=U, at T=10, y=9, reached.\n\nAll safe.\n\nBut is there a way with fewer turns? For example, if we can reach by T=9, but from y=2, min to y=9 is 7 moves, so at T=10.\n\nUnless we start at higher y, but no.\n\nPerhaps by going down to y=1 and up, but that would take more turns.\n\nSo H=8 is minimal.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 2 and 3, at T=6 dangerous, but we avoid.\n\nAnother thing: at T=6, y=2 and y=3 are dangerous, but in our path we are on y=5.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 dangerous at T=8 and T=9, we are on y=7 and y=8.\n\nAt T=7, y=6 is safe.\n\nBut let's confirm freeway 6 at T=7.\n\nk=T-3=4, span [-41+6*4, -30+6*4] = [-41+24, -30+24] = [-17,-6], yes, -17 to -6, all negative, 0 not in.\n\nAt T=8, k=5, [-41+30, -30+30] = [-11,0], 0 included, dangerous if on y=6.\n\nSimilarly T=9, k=6, [-41+36, -30+36]=[-5,6], 0 in.\n\nBut we not there.\n\nNow, for the output, actions all U.\n\nBut the sequence should be for each turn.\n\nAlso, in the answer format.\n\nBut we need to write the actions.\n\nBut is there any reason to do something else? For example, if at some point we need to wait.\n\nBut in this case, no need.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, but T=9 is safe.\n\nAnother freeway: y=8 dangerous at T=16-19, which is later.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nThus, minimal H=8, with actions all U from turn 3 to turn 9.\n\nBut turn 3 to turn 9, that's 7 actions, reaching at turn 10.\n\nIn the sequence: for t=0 to 6? H=8, t from 0 to 7, but t=0 to 7 is 8 actions? t from 0 to H-1=7, that's 8 values: t=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7.\n\nt=0: turn t1+0=3\n\nt=1: turn4\n\n...\n\nt=6: turn9\n\nt=7: turn10\n\nBut at turn10, if we set action, but we are at y=9, so action can be S, but we don't need to move.\n\nIn the sequence, the actions are to reach at turn t1+H-1=10, so the last action is at turn 9 to set y10=9.\n\nSo actions from turn 3 to turn 9, that is a3 to a9.\n\nFor t=0 to 6: t=0: a3, t=1: a4, ..., t=6: a9.\n\nH=8, t from 0 to H-1=7, so t=0 to 7.\n\nt=7: a_{t1+7}=a_{10}\n\nBut at turn10, we are at y10, and we set action a10, which affects y11, but we don't care, since we reached at turn10.\n\nTo be precise, we reach at turn t1+H-1=10, so at turn10, y=9, and we can have an action but it doesn't affect reaching.\n\nIn the action sequence, it includes a_{t1+H-1}=a10.\n\nBut since we reached at turn10, a10 can be anything, but to be clean, we can set a10=S.\n\nBut in this case, for min H, we just need to reach at turn10.\n\nIn the path, with actions up to a9, we reach at turn10.\n\nSo the actions are a3 to a9, 7 actions.\n\nH=8 means 8 turns from 3 to 10.\n\nIn the sequence, t from 0 to H-1=7, but for H=8, t=0 to7, 8 actions.\n\nBut we only need 7 actions to go from y=2 to y=9.\n\nFor example, with 7 actions: a3 to a9, reaching at turn10.\n\nThen H should be such that t1+H-1=10, t1=3, so 3+H-1=10, H=8.\n\nActions: {a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1=7, so t=0 to7, a_{3+0} to a_{3+7} = a3 to a10.\n\na10 is the action at turn10, which is after reaching.\n\nBut we can set a10=S, since we are already at y=9.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence, for turns 3 to 10, but only actions at 3 to9 are needed to reach.\n\nTo avoid confusion, in the output, we can list actions for turn 3 to turn 9.\n\nSince the sequence includes up to t1+H-1, and H=8, t1+H-1=10, so a10 must be included.\n\nBut a10 can be S.\n\nIn this case, since we reach at turn10, and a10 at turn10 doesn't change the position for turn10, it affects turn11.\n\nSo for the purpose, we can set a10=S.\n\nSimilarly, in the action list.\n\nBut to be minimal, we can have H such that actions from t1 to t1+H-2, but I think it's fine.\n\nI think for this problem, since the path is clear, we can proceed.\n\nSo actions: all U for turn 3 to turn 9, and for turn10, S or whatever, but since we need to output the sequence to reach, probably up to a9.\n\nBut let's see the answer format.\n\nIt says: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., up to the last action.\n\nIn the box, it should list the turns and actions.\n\nSince H=8, and reach at turn 10, actions from turn 3 to turn 10? But turn 10 action is after reaching.\n\nPerhaps I should set the actions only until we reach.\n\nBut the problem says the sequence {a_{t1+t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo for reach at turn 10, t1+H-1=10, t1=3, so H-1=7, H=8.\n\nActions t=0 to7: a3 to a10.\n\nThen at turn10, we set a10, which can be S.\n\nThen y11=y10 if S, still 9.\n\nBut we reached at turn10.\n\nSimilarly, we can set a10=S.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 3 to 10, but turn 10 action is redundant for reaching, but included.\n\nTo save, we can have H=7? But if H=7, reach at turn t1+H-1=3+7-1=9.\n\nBut at turn9, we are at y9, which in our path is 8, not 9.\n\nTo reach at turn9, we need to be at y=9 at turn9.\n\nBut from y=2 at turn3, to y=9 at turn9, that would require 6 moves? From turn3 to turn9, 6 actions: a3 to a8.\n\ny3=2, after a3 U, y4=3; a4 U, y5=4; ... up to a8 U, y9= y8 +1, so if y8=8, y9=9.\n\nBut we need to be at y8=8 at turn8.\n\nIn 5 actions: a3 to a7, to reach y8.\n\nLet's see if possible to reach earlier.\n\nStart T=3 y=2.\n\nAfter 5 actions (a3 to a7), at T=8 y=?\n\nIf all U: y4=3, y5=4, y6=5, y7=6, y8=7.\n\nThen at T=8, y=7, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at T=9, we need y9=9.\n\ny9 depends on y8 and a8.\n\ny9 = y8 + delta(a8)\n\nTo have y9=9, y8 must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y8=8, a8=U to y9=9.\n\nIf y8=9, a8=S or U, but y9=9.\n\nBut at T=8, y8 must be safe.\n\nFrom start, to have y8=8, we need to gain 6 from y2=2, so min 6 U moves in 5 actions? From T=3 to T=8, 5 actions: a3 to a7.\n\ny after a7 at T=8.\n\ny3=2\n\na3: if U, y4=3\n\na4: U, y5=4\n\na5: U, y6=5\n\na6: U, y7=6\n\na7: U, y8=7\n\nThen y8=7, then a8 needed to go to y9=8 or something.\n\nTo have y8=8, we need to be at y7=7 or 8 at T=7.\n\nBut from above, with 4 actions a3 to a6: y7=6 if all U.\n\ny7 = y6 + delta(a6), etc.\n\nTo have high y early, we need all U, but from y2 to y8 in 5 actions: actions a3 to a7 affect y4 to y8.\n\ny4 = y3 + delta(a3) <= 2+1=3\n\ny5 = y4 + delta(a4) <=4\n\n...\n\ny8 = y7 + delta(a7) <= y7 +1 <= ... <= 3+1+1+1+1=7? Max y8=7 if start from y3=2 with 5 actions all U.\n\ny3=2\n\nAfter a3 U, y4=3\n\na4 U, y5=4\n\na5 U, y6=5\n\na6 U, y7=6\n\na7 U, y8=7\n\nSo y8=7 max at T=8.\n\nThen y9 = y8 + delta(a8) <=8, so to y9=9, impossible at T=9.\n\ny9 <=8 if y8<=7.\n\ny8 <=7, so y9 <=8.\n\nThus, impossible to reach y=9 before T=10.\n\nMinimal T_final=10.\n\nThus H=8 is minimal.\n\nSo back to the path.\n\nActions: for turn 3 to turn 9: U each.\n\nAnd for turn 10, if included, S, but not necessary.\n\nIn the sequence, with H=8, actions from t=0 to7: turn 3 to 10.\n\na3 to a10.\n\na10 can be S.\n\nBut since we reach at turn 10, and the action at turn 10 doesn't affect reaching, we can list only up to a9.\n\nBut to follow the format.\n\nI think for the output, we list actions for the turns until the reach turn.\n\nPerhaps in the box, we list from turn t1 to the action before reach.\n\nBut let's see the format example.\n\nIt says: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so for each turn, the action.\n\nSince H=8, and actions for t=0 to H-1, we have 8 actions: turn 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\na3 to a10.\n\na3=U, a4=U, a5=U, a6=U, a7=U, a8=U, a9=U, a10=S (since at y9, stay).\n\nBut a10 is after reaching.\n\nIn the sequence, a9=U to go to y10=9.\n\nThen a10=S, but not needed.\n\nTo minimize, but I think it's fine.\n\nWe can set H such that actions only to reach.\n\nBut the problem defines H as the number where we reach at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo for reach at turn 10, H=8.\n\nActions include a10.\n\nBut in the collision, we don't care after reaching.\n\nSo for output:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: S  (or U, but S to stay)\n\nBut turn 10 action is at turn 10, which is after we are at y=9.\n\nPerhaps it's acceptable.\n\nTo have only 7 actions, but H=7 would mean reach at turn 3+7-1=9, which is impossible as above.\n\nSo H must be 8.\n\nThus, the sequence includes 8 actions.\n\nNow, for the cars, in our path, all safe.\n\nBut is there an issue at some point?\n\nAnother thing: at T=7, y=6, we are there, and it is safe, but the car on y=6 at T=7 is not at x=0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster in some lanes, but no.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nFirst, minimal H=8.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: S  (since at y=9, we stay)\n\nBut in the sequence, turn 10 is included.\n\nIn the answer, it should be for turns starting from t1=3.\n\nNow, in the box.\n\nBut for freeway 7 and 8, we have cars, but in our path, at T=8 we are on y=7, which is safe, no cars at x=0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm if at T=3, y=2 is safe: yes.\n\nBut in the car state for y=2, at T=3: k=0, first car span [-47,-36], second [25,36], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo all good.\n\nThus, the action sequence is U for turns 3 to 9, and S for turn 10.\n\nBut turn 9 action U sets y10=9, so turn 10 S is extra.\n\nBut since the sequence requires it, we can include.\n\nTo be precise, in the action list, for turn t, action a_t.\n\nAt turn 10, we can choose S.\n\nSo output:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 3: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: S \\end{array} }\n\nBut H=8, and actions from t=0 to 7, turn 3 to 10.\n\nYes.\n\nSince we reach at turn 10, and turn 10 action doesn't matter, but we need to specify.\n\nIn some interpretations, the action at turn t is chosen before position update, but I think it's fine.\n\nI think this should work.\n\nBut let's see if we can avoid turn 10 action.\n\nPerhaps set H=7, but impossible as above.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) is 8, meaning the player reaches the goal at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 3 + 8 - 1 = 10\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is determined by moving up (U) at each turn from turn 3 to turn 9 to incrementally increase the y-coordinate from 2 to 9. At turn 10, the player is already at y=9, so the action is stay (S) to remain at y=9, though this action does not affect reaching the goal at turn 10.\n\n### Collision Avoidance Verification:\n- **Turn 3 (y=2)**: Safe because at T=3 (k=0), the car spans on freeway y=2 are [-47, -36] and [25, 36]; 0 is not in either span.\n- **Turn 4 (y=3)**: Safe because at T=4 (k=1), the car spans on freeway y=3 are [-35, -24] and [37, 48]; 0 is not in either span (dangerous only at T=6).\n- **Turn 5 (y=4)**: Safe because freeway y=4 is always safe (car span is always negative).\n- **Turn 6 (y=5)**: Safe because freeway y=5 is always safe (car span is always negative).\n- **Turn 7 (y=6)**: Safe because at T=7 (k=4), the car span on freeway y=6 is [-17, -6]; 0 is not in the span (dangerous at T=8 and T=9).\n- **Turn 8 (y=7)**: Safe because freeway y=7 is always safe (car spans are always positive).\n- **Turn 9 (y=8)**: Safe because at T=9 (k=6), the car span on freeway y=8 is [-32, -21]; 0 is not in the span (dangerous at T=16-19).\n- **Turn 10 (y=9)**: No collision possible as y=9 is not a freeway.\n\nAll actions are U from turn 3 to 9 to reach y=9 by turn 10, with S at turn 10 to stay at y=9.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe actions for turns \\(t_1 + t = 3 + t\\) for \\(t = 0\\) to \\(H-1 = 7\\) are as follows:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 3: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: S \\end{array} }",

The current turn is t_1 = 4, and I start at y=3.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements. Cars move left or right at constant speeds, and I need to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at x=0 at that turn.\n\nThe collision happens only if at turn T, I'm on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car whose span includes 0 at exactly turn T.\n\nAlso, when I move from y to y+1 or y-1 at turn T, I'm not on y+1 until turn T+1, so I don't care about cars on the new row until the next turn.\n\nLet me list all the cars for each freeway at turn t=4.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head -48, tail -95, direction right, speed 48. Since it's moving right, the span at time t is [τ + s(t - t_1), h + s(t - t_1)], but t_1 is 4, so let's define the span as a function of time.\n\nSet τ = t - t_1, so at τ=0 (turn 4), we have the initial positions.\n\nFor freeway 1: car: head h = -48, tail τ = -95? The table says \"head h, tail τ\", but in the update, for right-moving, it says [τ, h] becomes [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]. I think there might be confusion in notation.\n\nLook at the car update:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), so for right-moving, head and tail might be defined such that head is the front.\n\nFor right-moving car: at t_1, span is [tail, head] with tail < head, since it moves right.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, span is [head, tail] with head > tail? Let's see.\n\nIn left-moving update: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] and h is head, τ is tail, but since it's moving left, head should be larger, tail smaller, so [h, τ] with h > τ, I assume.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nIn the table for freeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48). So head = -48, tail = -95. Since direction right, and tail = -95, head = -48, so tail < head, so at t_1, span is [τ, h] = [-95, -48].\n\nThen at time T, span is [ -95 + 48*(T-4), -48 + 48*(T-4) ]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision when I am on freeway k at turn T, and 0 is in the span of some car on freeway k at turn T.\n\nAlso, I start at y=3 at turn 4.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\ny from 0 to 9, freeways are y=1 to 8, so I need to cross rows 4,5,6,7,8 to reach 9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, no car there.\n\nNow, since I can move up, down, or stay, but I want minimal turns, so I should move up as much as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway and each possible time when a car is at x=0, so I know when I should not be on that row.\n\nSince cars move continuously, but we care about discrete turns.\n\nDefine Δt = T - t_1, so for time after turn 4.\n\nFor each freeway k, I need to find times T where for some car, 0 is in Span(T).\n\nThen, if I am on freeway k at turn T, and such T exists, I collide.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nBut for each row, I might be there at different times, so I need to plan the sequence.\n\nSince I want min H, and H is the number of turns, including the starting turn? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is from t= t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so after H turns, I am at turn t_1 + H -1, and y=9.\n\nAt turn t_1, I am at position (0,y_{t_1}), and I take action a_{t_1}, which determines y_{t_1 +1}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, from t= t_1 to t_1 + H-1, I have H actions, and at turn t_1 + H -1, I have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nTurn indices: at turn t, I am at position (0, y_t), then I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} for turn t+1.\n\nSo starting at turn t_1=4, y_4 =3.\n\nI take action a_4, which sets y_5, then at turn 5, I am at (0,y_5), take a_5, and so on, until at some turn T, y_T =9, and T = t_1 + H -1, so H = T - t_1 +1.\n\nMin H means min T, since t_1 fixed.\n\nH is number of actions, from t= t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, I reach turn t_1 + H -1 with y=9.\n\nSo the turn number when I arrive at y=9 is T_arrive = t_1 + H -1.\n\nTo minimize H, I need to minimize T_arrive, since t_1 fixed.\n\nH = T_arrive - t_1 +1, so min H is min T_arrive.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as early as possible.\n\nStart at y=3, need to get to y=9, so minimum moves if no cars: 6 up moves, but I might need to stay or move down to avoid cars, so it could take more turns.\n\nBut since cars are moving, I might time my crossing to avoid them.\n\nFirst, for each freeway row from 1 to 8, find the times when it is occupied at x=0, i.e., when 0 is in some car's span.\n\nThen, for each possible path and timing, I can see if I can avoid those occupied times.\n\nSince I move one row per turn at most, I can think in terms of when I arrive at each row.\n\nBut I don't necessarily arrive at a row at a specific turn; I could be on a row for multiple turns if I stay.\n\nLet's list all freeways and their cars.\n\nFreeway 1: k=1, one car: head -48, tail -95, dir right, speed 48.\n\nAt Δt = T - 4, span: [ -95 + 48*Δt, -48 + 48*Δt ]\n\n0 in span when -95 +48Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -48 +48Δt\n\nSo -95 +48Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -48 +48Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -95 +48Δt ≤ 0 => 48Δt ≤ 95 => Δt ≤ 95/48 ≈ 1.979\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48 +48Δt => 48Δt ≥ 48 => Δt ≥ 1\n\nSo Δt between 1 and 1.979, so since Δt integer, only Δt=1? Δt=1: T=5\n\nΔt=1: -95 +48= -47, -48+48=0, so [ -47, 0], 0 is included? 0 ≤ 0 yes, and -47 ≤ 0 yes, so 0 in [ -47, 0]? [ -47, 0] includes 0.\n\n-47 to 0, yes, 0 is the right endpoint.\n\nSimilarly, Δt=2: -95 +96=1, -48+96=48, [1,48], 0 not in.\n\nΔt=0: at T=4, [ -95, -48], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=5, 0 is in the span for freeway 1.\n\nBut freeway 1 is row y=1, and at T=5, if I am on y=1, I collide.\n\nNow, I start at y=3 at T=4, so I might not be on y=1 at T=5.\n\nNext, freeway 2: k=2, two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-24, -35, right, 12)\n\nSecond car: (48, 37, right, 12) head 48, tail 37? Tail 37, head 48, but direction right, so [τ, h] = [37,48]? But 37<48, so [37,48] at Δt=0.\n\nThen at Δt, [37 +12Δt, 48 +12Δt]\n\n0 in this? 37+12Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 48+12Δt\n\nBut 37+12Δt ≥37 >0 for Δt≥0, so 0 ≤ 37+12Δt always true for Δt≥0, but 0 ≥ 37+12Δt? 37+12Δt >0, so 0 < 37+12Δt, so 0 not ≤ left endpoint, so never in.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (48,37, right,12), but head 48, tail 37, so same as above? First car is (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nHead -24, tail -35, dir right.\n\nSo [τ, h] = [-35, -24] at Δt=0.\n\nThen at Δt, [-35 +12Δt, -24 +12Δt]\n\n0 in span: -35+12Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -24+12Δt\n\nFirst: -35+12Δt ≤0 => 12Δt ≤35 => Δt ≤ 35/12 ≈ 2.916\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -24+12Δt => 12Δt ≥24 => Δt ≥2\n\nSo Δt=2 or Δt=3? Δt=2: -35+24= -11, -24+24=0, [ -11, 0], 0 included.\n\nΔt=3: -35+36=1, -24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo at Δt=2, T=6, 0 in span.\n\nNow second car on freeway 2: (48,37,right,12)\n\nHead 48, tail 37, [τ,h] = [37,48] at Δt=0, [37+12Δt,48+12Δt]\n\nMin 37>0, so 0 never in.\n\nSo for freeway 2, only car 1 has 0 at T=6.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? Cars: (-24,-35,right,12) and (48,37,right,12)\n\nExactly same as freeway 2? Freeway 3 also has the same two cars.\n\nIn table: freeway 2 and 3 both have same cars? Let me check.\n\nFreeway 2: (-24,-35,right,12), (48,37,right,12)\n\nFreeway 3: (-24,-35,right,12), (48,37,right,12) same.\n\nIs that right? Probably different rows, but same car configurations.\n\nFor freeway 3, same as above, so at T=6, car 1 has 0 in span.\n\nBut row y=3? Freeway k=3 is row y=3.\n\nI am at y=3 at T=4.\n\nAt T=4, on y=3, is there collision?\n\nFor freeway 3 at T=4, Δt=0.\n\nCar 1: [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nCar 2: [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nSo at T=4, y=3 is safe.\n\nNow at T=6, if on y=3, collide with car 1.\n\nBut I might not be there.\n\nNow freeway 4: k=4, one car: (48,83,left,36)\n\nDirection left, so span at t_1: [h, τ] = [48,83]? Head 48, tail 83? But direction left, and for left-moving, span is [h, τ] with h head, τ tail.\n\nBut typically for left-moving, head is left, tail right? Let's see update.\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt]\n\nWith head and tail, but in the span, [h, τ], if moving left, h should be larger than τ? In the update, it goes to [h -sΔt, τ -sΔt], so if s>0, it decreases, so h and τ both decrease.\n\nBut in the span [h, τ], if h and τ, which is left and right?\n\nIn the car state, for left-moving, head h, tail τ, but in the span, it's [h, τ] and then moves left.\n\nBut numerically, for this car: head 48, tail 83, so h=48, τ=83, so [48,83], but 48<83, so from 48 to 83, but moving left, so it should be that head is at 48, tail at 83, so the car extends from left to right? But if moving left, the head should be on the left.\n\nI think there's inconsistency in notation.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nFor left-moving car: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ]\" and then Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn this case, h=48, τ=83, so at t_1, [48,83], and since moving left, the values decrease.\n\n0 in span when h - sΔt ≤ 0 ≤ τ - sΔt\n\nSo 48 -36Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 83 -36Δt\n\nFirst inequality: 48 -36Δt ≤ 0 => -36Δt ≤ -48 => 36Δt ≥48 => Δt ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ 83 -36Δt => 36Δt ≤83 => Δt ≤ 83/36 ≈ 2.305\n\nSo Δt between 1.333 and 2.305, so Δt=2? Δt=2: 48-72= -24, 83-72=11, [ -24,11], 0 in since -24≤0≤11.\n\nΔt=1: 48-36=12, 83-36=47, [12,47], 0 not in.\n\nΔt=3: 48-108= -60, 83-108= -25, [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at Δt=2, T=6.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: same car? (48,83,left,36) same as freeway 4, so at T=6, 0 in span for y=5.\n\nFreeway 5, k=5, row y=5.\n\nAt T=6, if on y=5, collide.\n\nNow freeway 6: k=6, one car: (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nDirection right, head -24, tail -35, so [τ,h] = [-35,-24] at Δt=0.\n\nThen at Δt, [-35 +6Δt, -24 +6Δt]\n\n0 in span: -35+6Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -24+6Δt\n\nFirst: -35+6Δt ≤0 => 6Δt ≤35 => Δt ≤ 35/6 ≈5.833\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -24+6Δt => 6Δt ≥24 => Δt ≥4\n\nSo Δt from 4 to 5.833, so Δt=4,5.\n\nΔt=4: -35+24= -11, -24+24=0, [ -11,0], 0 in.\n\nΔt=5: -35+30= -5, -24+30=6, [ -5,6], 0 in.\n\nΔt=6: -35+36=1, -24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo at T=4+4=8 and T=4+5=9, 0 in span for freeway 6.\n\nT=8 and T=9.\n\nNow freeway 7: k=7, two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,4)\n\nHead -48, tail -59, dir right, so [τ,h] = [-59,-48] at Δt=0.\n\nAt Δt, [-59 +4Δt, -48 +4Δt]\n\n0 in: -59+4Δt ≤0 ≤ -48+4Δt\n\nFirst: -59+4Δt ≤0 => 4Δt ≤59 => Δt ≤ 59/4=14.75\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48+4Δt => 4Δt ≥48 => Δt ≥12\n\nSo Δt from 12 to 14.75, so Δt=12,13,14.\n\nT=4+12=16, 17,18.\n\nSecond car on freeway 7: (16,5,right,4)\n\nHead 16, tail 5, dir right, so [τ,h] = [5,16] at Δt=0.\n\nAt Δt, [5+4Δt, 16+4Δt]\n\nMin 5>0, so 0 never in.\n\nSo only first car matters, 0 in at T=16,17,18.\n\nNow freeway 8: k=8, one car: (-36,-47,right,3)\n\nHead -36, tail -47, dir right, [τ,h] = [-47,-36] at Δt=0.\n\nAt Δt, [-47 +3Δt, -36 +3Δt]\n\n0 in: -47+3Δt ≤0 ≤ -36+3Δt\n\nFirst: -47+3Δt ≤0 => 3Δt ≤47 => Δt ≤ 47/3≈15.666\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -36+3Δt => 3Δt ≥36 => Δt ≥12\n\nSo Δt from 12 to 15.666, Δt=12,13,14,15.\n\nT=16,17,18,19.\n\nNow, summarize for each row, the times when it is occupied (collision if on that row at that turn):\n\ny=1: occupied at T=5\n\ny=2: freeway 2, occupied at T=6\n\ny=3: freeway 3, occupied at T=6\n\ny=4: freeway 4, occupied at T=6? Freeway 4 is y=4, occupied at T=6\n\nEarlier: freeway 4 at T=6\n\nBut freeway 4 is y=4.\n\nSimilarly y=5: freeway 5, occupied at T=6\n\ny=6: freeway 6, occupied at T=8 and T=9\n\ny=7: freeway 7, occupied at T=16,17,18\n\ny=8: freeway 8, occupied at T=16,17,18,19\n\nAlso, for rows not mentioned, no cars or no occupation, so always safe except at those times.\n\nFor example, y=1 only at T=5, y=2 at T=6, etc.\n\ny=2 and y=3 both at T=6, y=4 and y=5 at T=6? y=4,5 at T=6.\n\ny=4: freeway 4, occupied T=6\n\ny=5: freeway 5, occupied T=6\n\nNow, I start at T=4, y=3.\n\ny=3 is safe at T=4, as we saw.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so I just need to be there.\n\nTo minimize T_arrive, I should go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on a row when it is occupied.\n\nThe occupations are at specific times.\n\nList the dangerous times:\n\n- y=1: T=5\n\n- y=2: T=6\n\n- y=3: T=6\n\n- y=4: T=6\n\n- y=5: T=6\n\n- y=6: T=8,9\n\n- y=7: T=16,17,18\n\n- y=8: T=16,17,18,19\n\ny=6 occupied at T=8 and 9, but not at other times, I assume.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, I am at y=3 at T=4.\n\nI want to go to y=9.\n\nThe fastest way is to go up every turn: from T=4, y=3\n\na_4: U, then T=5, y=4\n\nBut at T=5, if y=4, but y=4 is freeway 4, which is occupied only at T=6, not at T=5.\n\nAt T=5, which rows are occupied?\n\ny=1 at T=5, but I'm not on y=1.\n\ny=4 at T=5: is it occupied? From above, y=4 occupied only at T=6, not T=5.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 only at T=6.\n\nSo at T=5, if I go to y=4, it should be safe.\n\nThen T=5, y=4, take action.\n\nIf I go up, to y=5 at T=6.\n\nBut at T=6, y=5 is occupied, since freeway 5 at T=6 has car at x=0.\n\nCollision.\n\nSo cannot be on y=5 at T=6.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay at y=4 at T=5, then at T=6, y=4 is occupied, collision.\n\nOr if I go down, but that might not help.\n\nSo from T=4 y=3, if I go up to y=4 at T=5, then at T=5 I am on y=4, which is safe, but then at T=6, if I go to y=5, I arrive at y=5 at T=6, which is occupied.\n\nIf I stay on y=4 at T=5, then at T=6 I am on y=4, occupied, collision.\n\nIf I go down to y=3 at T=5, but at T=5, y=3: is it occupied? y=3 occupied at T=6, not T=5. At T=5, y=3 should be safe.\n\nBut then I'm at y=3, which is below, and I need to go up.\n\nBut at T=6, if I am on y=3, it is occupied, collision.\n\nSo from T=4 y=3, if I do anything, I might be in trouble at T=6 if I stay low.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nAt T=4, I am at y=3, safe.\n\nI take action a_4, which determines y_5.\n\nThen at T=5, I am at (0,y_5), and so on.\n\nNow, at T=5, dangerous row is only y=1, so as long as I'm not on y=1, safe.\n\nSimilarly at T=6, dangerous rows: y=2,3,4,5 all occupied at T=6.\n\ny=2,3,4,5 all have cars at x=0 at T=6.\n\nSo at T=6, if I am on any of y=2,3,4,5, I collide.\n\nThe only safe rows at T=6 are y=0,1,6,7,8,9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think, but y=0 might be the bottom, but the freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so always safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=6: at T=6, is it occupied? y=6 occupied at T=8 and 9, not at T=6.\n\nSimilarly y=7 and 8 not occupied until later.\n\nSo at T=6, safe rows: y=0,1,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut y=1 is occupied at T=5, not at T=6.\n\nAt T=6, y=1: is there car? Freeway 1 only occupied at T=5, not other times.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 only at T=6, etc.\n\nSo at T=6, y=1 is safe, since no car at x=0.\n\nSimilarly y=6,7,8,9 safe.\n\nOnly y=2,3,4,5 dangerous at T=6.\n\nNow back to planning.\n\nI am at T=4, y=3.\n\nI need to not be on y=2,3,4,5 at T=6.\n\nSince at T=6, those are unsafe.\n\nNow, possible actions:\n\nOption 1: at T=4, go up to y=4 at T=5.\n\nThen at T=5, y=4 (safe, since not occupied at T=5).\n\nThen at T=5, I need to choose action to go somewhere.\n\nIf I go up to y=5 at T=6, but y=5 unsafe at T=6.\n\nIf I stay, y=4 at T=6, unsafe.\n\nIf I go down to y=3 at T=6, unsafe.\n\nAll bad.\n\nOption 2: at T=4, stay at y=3.\n\nThen T=5, y=3 (safe, since not occupied at T=5).\n\nThen at T=5, if I go up to y=4 at T=6, unsafe.\n\nIf I stay, y=3 at T=6, unsafe.\n\nIf I go down to y=2 at T=6, unsafe.\n\nAlso bad.\n\nOption 3: at T=4, go down to y=2 at T=5.\n\nBut at T=5, y=2: is it safe? At T=5, dangerous only y=1, so y=2 safe.\n\nThen at T=5, y=2.\n\nThen at T=5, if I go up to y=3 at T=6, unsafe (y=3 occupied).\n\nIf I stay, y=2 at T=6, unsafe.\n\nIf I go down to y=1 at T=6.\n\nBut at T=6, y=1 is safe, since only occupied at T=5, not T=6.\n\nSo I could go to y=1 at T=6.\n\nThen I am at y=1 at T=6, safe.\n\nBut y=1 is low, and I need to go to y=9, so it will take more turns.\n\nSimilarly, from T=4, I could go down to y=2 at T=5, then to y=1 at T=6.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nAnother idea: I need to be at a safe row at T=6.\n\nSafe rows at T=6: y=0,1,6,7,8,9.\n\ny=0 or 1 is low, y=6,7,8,9 are high.\n\nFrom y=3 at T=4, can I reach y=6 or above by T=6?\n\nT=6 is two turns later.\n\nFrom T=4 to T=5: one action, y changes by -1,0,+1.\n\nSimilarly from T=5 to T=6.\n\nSo from y=3 at T=4, after one action, at T=5, y can be 2,3,4.\n\nThen from there, after another action, at T=6, y can be from 1 to 5 if from y=2,3,4.\n\nSpecifically, min y at T=6: if down both times, y=1.\n\nMax y at T=6: if up both times, y=5.\n\nSo at T=6, I can be at y=1,2,3,4,5.\n\nBut the safe y at T=6 are only y=0,1,6,7,8,9, but from above, I can only reach y=1 to 5 at T=6, so only y=1 is possible safe, since y=0 not reachable? y=0 is below.\n\ny=0: from y=3, I can go down to y=2 at T=5, then to y=1 or y=0? y_t+1 = y_t + Δy, with Δy from action, and y in [0,9], so I can go to y=0.\n\nFor example, from y=3, go down to y=2 at T=5, then down to y=1 at T=6, or down to y=0 if I go down again, but at T=5, from y=2, go down to y=1 at T=6.\n\ny=1 at T=6 is safe.\n\ny=0 at T=6 is also safe.\n\nBut y=0 or 1 is low, so I will need more turns to reach y=9.\n\nThe other safe rows like y=6,7,8,9 are not reachable by T=6 from y=3 in two moves, since max y=5.\n\nSo at T=6, I must be at y=1 to be safe, or y=0.\n\ny=0 or y=1.\n\nBut y=0 is not necessary, y=1 is fine.\n\nSo I need to be at y=1 at T=6 to avoid collision.\n\nThen from there, I can go up.\n\nBut let's confirm.\n\nAt T=4, y=3.\n\nI need to be at y=1 at T=6.\n\nHow?\n\nOption: at T=4, go down to y=2 at T=5.\n\nThen at T=5, go down to y=1 at T=6.\n\nAt T=5, y=2 is safe, as established.\n\nAt T=6, y=1 is safe.\n\nThen I am at y=1 at T=6.\n\nNow, from here, I need to go to y=9.\n\ny=1 to y=9, 8 steps up, but I can do it in 8 turns if no cars, but there are cars on y=6 at T=8,9, and y=7,8 at later times.\n\nFirst, let's see the path.\n\nAfter T=6, at y=1.\n\nNow, I want to go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut I need to avoid the dangerous times.\n\nFirst, y=2: is it dangerous? y=2 only dangerous at T=6, which is past, so for T>6, y=2 is safe, since no other occupation.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 only at T=6, safe after.\n\ny=4 only at T=6, safe after.\n\ny=5 only at T=6, safe after.\n\ny=6 dangerous at T=8 and T=9.\n\ny=7 dangerous at T=16,17,18\n\ny=8 dangerous at T=16,17,18,19\n\ny=9 always safe.\n\nSo from T=6, at y=1, I can start going up.\n\nNow, the next danger is at y=6, T=8 and T=9.\n\nI need to not be on y=6 at T=8 or T=9.\n\nSimilarly, later for y=7 and 8.\n\nBut first, let's go from y=1 to y=6 as fast as possible.\n\nFrom y=1 at T=6, if I go up every turn:\n\nT=6, y=1\n\na_6: U, T=7, y=2\n\na_7: U, T=8, y=3\n\nBut at T=8, y=3 is safe, since only dangerous at T=6.\n\ny=3 safe.\n\nThen a_7: U to y=3 at T=8? Let's sequence.\n\nAt turn T=6, position y=1, take action a_6.\n\nIf a_6=U, then y_7 = y_6 +1 =2 at T=7.\n\nThen at T=7, y=2, take a_7.\n\nIf a_7=U, then y_8 =3 at T=8.\n\nAt T=8, y=3 safe.\n\nThen continue: a_8: U, y_9=4 at T=9\n\na_9: U, y_10=5 at T=10\n\na_10: U, y_11=6 at T=11\n\nBut at T=11, y=6: is it dangerous? y=6 dangerous at T=8 and 9, not T=11, so safe.\n\nThen a_11: U, y_12=7 at T=12\n\nNow at T=12, y=7: dangerous at T=16,17,18, not now, so safe.\n\nBut later I need to avoid T=16,17,18 for y=7.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nBut I can go faster? From y=1 to y=6, min 5 moves: to y=2 at T=7, y=3 at T=8, y=4 at T=9, y=5 at T=10, y=6 at T=11.\n\nBut at T=8, y=3 safe, T=9 y=4 safe, etc.\n\ny=6 at T=11, which is after T=9, so safe.\n\nThen from y=6 at T=11, go to y=7 at T=12, etc.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nT_arrive at y=9: from above, at T=11 y=6, then U to y=7 at T=12, U to y=8 at T=13, U to y=9 at T=14.\n\nSo T=14.\n\nBut is there a way to be faster?\n\nEarlier I had to go down to y=1 at T=6, which cost two moves down from T=4.\n\nAt T=4 y=3, instead of going down, can I go up and avoid differently?\n\nFor example, at T=4, go up to y=4 at T=5.\n\nThen at T=5, y=4, I need to go somewhere not y=2,3,4,5 at T=6.\n\nBut from y=4 at T=5, I can only go to y=3,4,5 at T=6, all unsafe.\n\nUnless I can jump, but no, only adjacent moves.\n\nSo impossible to be at safe high row at T=6.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay or down, same issue.\n\nSo must be at low row at T=6.\n\ny=0 or y=1.\n\ny=1 is better.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nFrom T=6 y=1, go up: T=6 y=1, a6=U, T=7 y=2\n\nT=7 y=2, a7=U, T=8 y=3\n\nT=8 y=3, a8=U, T=9 y=4\n\nT=9 y=4, a9=U, T=10 y=5\n\nT=10 y=5, a10=U, T=11 y=6\n\nNow at T=11 y=6, but y=6 is dangerous at T=8 and T=9, but T=11 is later, so safe.\n\na11=U, T=12 y=7\n\nT=12 y=7, now y=7 dangerous at T=16,17,18, so at T=12, safe.\n\nBut I need to go to y=8 and y=9.\n\ny=8 dangerous at T=16,17,18,19.\n\nTo reach y=9 before T=16? T=12 to T=16 is 4 turns, I can go up to y=9 by T=14 or so.\n\nFrom T=12 y=7:\n\na12=U, T=13 y=8\n\na13=U, T=14 y=9\n\nNow, at T=13 y=8: is it dangerous? T=13, y=8 dangerous at T=16,17,18,19, not T=13, so safe.\n\nT=14 y=9, goal.\n\nT_arrive =14.\n\nBut is there a way to be faster?\n\nEarlier I started from T=6 y=1.\n\nT=6 is after I arrived at y=1.\n\nI am at T=4 y=3, go down to T=5 y=2, then down to T=6 y=1.\n\nThen from T=6 to T=14, that's 8 turns? Let's count turns.\n\nTurns: t_1=4 is start.\n\nAction sequence.\n\nAt turn 4: action to set y5.\n\nTurn 5: action to set y6, etc.\n\nArrive at y=9 at turn T.\n\nFrom above:\n\nTurn 4: action, say D, to go to y=2 at turn 5.\n\nTurn 5: action D, to go to y=1 at turn 6.\n\nTurn 6: action U, to go to y=2 at turn 7.\n\nTurn 7: action U, to y=3 at turn 8.\n\nTurn 8: action U, to y=4 at turn 9.\n\nTurn 9: action U, to y=5 at turn 10.\n\nTurn 10: action U, to y=6 at turn 11.\n\nTurn 11: action U, to y=7 at turn 12.\n\nTurn 12: action U, to y=8 at turn 13.\n\nTurn 13: action U, to y=9 at turn 14.\n\nSo at turn 14, y=9.\n\nH = number of actions from t=4 to t=13? Actions from t=4 to t=13, that's 10 actions? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence of actions: a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9, a10, a11, a12, a13.\n\nThat's 10 actions.\n\nT_arrive = turn 14.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =4 + H -1 =14, so 3 + H =14, H=11? Messed up.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = T_arrive\n\nt_1=4, T_arrive=14, so 4 + H -1 =14, so 3 + H =14, H=11.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=4 to t=13, that's 10 actions? t from 4 to 13 inclusive is 10 turns? Turn indices.\n\nAt turn t, we take action a_t.\n\nFor t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nHere, after actions a4 to a13, that's 10 actions, we are at turn 14, y=9.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =4 + H -1 =14, so H=11? 4+H-1=14, H=11.\n\nBut 10 actions: a4 to a13 is 10 actions, but t from 4 to 13, 10 values, then turn after last action is turn 14.\n\nYes.\n\nBut H=11? 4+11-1=14, yes H=11.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have 10 actions? List: actions at t=4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13: that's 10 actions.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = t_1 + (number of actions) -1? Number of actions is H.\n\nAfter H actions, from t=t_1 to t=t_1 + H -1, we have taken H actions, and are at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nHere, at turn 13, after a13, we are at y_14=9.\n\nTurn 14 is when we are at y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the sequence above, I have actions from t=4 to t=13, 10 actions, H=10, t_1 + H -1 =4+10-1=13, but at turn 13, y=8? No.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo at turn 4, position y4=3, take a4, then y5 is set.\n\nAt turn 5, position y5, take a5, and so on.\n\nAfter taking a13 at turn 13, y14 is set to 9.\n\nSo at turn 14, position y14=9.\n\nSo T_arrive=14.\n\nWith actions from t=4 to t=13, 10 actions.\n\nH=10, t_1 + H -1=4+10-1=13, but at turn 13, we are at position before action, y13, then after a13, y14=9.\n\nThe turn when we arrive at y=9 is turn 14.\n\nIn the state, at turn T, we are at (0,y_T).\n\nSo to have y_T=9, T=14.\n\nAnd actions from t=4 to t=13, H=10 actions.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =4 + H -1 = T_arrive =14, so 3+H=14, H=11? Inconsistency.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = T_arrive\n\n4 + H -1 =14\n\n3 + H =14\n\nH=11\n\nBut 11 actions? From t=4 to t=14? t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nIf H=11, actions from t=4 to t=4+11-1=14? t=4 to t=14, that's 11 actions.\n\nThen after a14, y15 is set, but we want y at turn t_1 + H -1 =4+11-1=14.\n\nAt turn 14, we are at y14, which is set by a13? Let's clarify.\n\nStandard: at turn t, we are at position y_t.\n\nThen we take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nSo to be at y_T =9 at turn T.\n\ny_T is determined by a_{T-1}, from y_{T-1}.\n\nWith initial y_{t_1} given.\n\nHere t_1=4, y4=3.\n\nWe take actions a4, a5, ..., up to a_{T-1} to reach y_T=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=4 to t=T-1, that's (T-1) - 4 +1 = T-4 actions.\n\nThen T_arrive = T, H = number of actions = T - t_1.\n\nSince actions from t=t_1 to t= T-1, that's (T-1) - t_1 +1 = T - t_1 actions.\n\nThen H = T - t_1.\n\nT_arrive = T, so H = T - t_1.\n\nt_1=4, T=14, H=10.\n\nIn the formula, t_1 + H -1 =4 + H -1 =3+H =T, so H=T-3, since t_1=4, H=T-4? Let's not confuse.\n\nFrom the problem: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nThe sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, a_{t_1 + t}\n\nSo for example, t=0, a_{t_1}, t=1, a_{t_1 +1}, ..., t=H-1, a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nThen after these H actions, at turn (t_1 + H -1) +1? After action a_{t_1 + H -1}, we set y_{t_1 + H}, but we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9? Let's read.\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\n\"such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nAnd actions from t=0 to H-1, a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nFor t=0, a_{t_1}, t=1, a_{t_1+1}, ..., t=H-1, a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nThen after taking a_{t_1 + H -1}, we have y_{t_1 + H} set, but we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, before taking action, we are at y_{t_1 + H -1}, and we want this to be 9.\n\nThen we take action a_{t_1 + H -1}, which might be anything, but since we reached, we can stop or whatever, but the position is already at (0,9) at that turn.\n\nIn the sequence, we include actions up to the turn before we arrive, but since we arrive at turn t_1 + H -1, we need to have taken actions to be there at that turn.\n\nFrom the action, y_{t+1} depends on a_t.\n\nSo to have y_T =9, we need the actions from t=t_1 to t=T-1 to set it.\n\nThen at turn T, we are at y_T=9.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn T, we don't take action if we have arrived.\n\nBut in the output, we list actions from t_1 to the turn before arrival.\n\nIn this case, for T_arrive=14, actions from t=4 to t=13, H=10 actions.\n\nThen at turn 14, y=9.\n\nAnd in the sequence, actions a4 to a13.\n\nH=10.\n\nIn the box, we list for turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nBack to the problem.\n\nIn the path I have, I arrive at T=14 with 10 actions.\n\nBut can I do better?\n\nFor example, from T=6 y=1, I go up to T=7 y=2, T=8 y=3, T=9 y=4, T=10 y=5, T=11 y=6.\n\nAt T=11 y=6, safe.\n\nThen to y=7 at T=12, y=8 at T=13, y=9 at T=14.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut at y=6, it is dangerous at T=8 and T=9, but I am there at T=11, fine.\n\nCan I reach y=6 earlier?\n\nFrom T=6 y=1, min to y=6 is 5 moves: to y=2 at T=7, y=3 at T=8, y=4 at T=9, y=5 at T=10, y=6 at T=11.\n\nT=11 is earliest for y=6.\n\nThen to y=9 at T=14.\n\nBut T=14 might be late because of the later dangers, but at T=14, y=7 and y=8 are not dangerous yet, since dangers at T=16.\n\nT=14 <16, so safe.\n\nBut is there a way to avoid going down to y=1?\n\nFor example, at T=4, if I go up to y=4 at T=5.\n\nThen at T=5, y=4, I need to go to a safe row at T=6, but the only safe rows I can reach are y=1 or y=0, but from y=4, I can go down to y=3,2,1 at T=6.\n\ny=1 is safe, y=0 safe, but y=1 or 0.\n\nThen same as before, I end up at y=1 at T=6 anyway.\n\nIf from y=4 at T=5, go down to y=3 at T=6, but y=3 unsafe at T=6.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo must be at y=1 or below at T=6.\n\ny=1 is best.\n\nNow, another thing: at T=6, I am at y=1, but y=1 is safe.\n\nThen I go up.\n\nBut at T=8 and T=9, y=6 is dangerous.\n\nSo when I am going up, I need to not be on y=6 at T=8 or T=9.\n\nIn my path, at T=8 I am at y=3, T=9 at y=4, both safe, T=10 y=5, safe, T=11 y=6, safe.\n\nCan I be on y=6 before T=8 or after T=9?\n\nAfter T=9, like T=10 or later, but I can only reach y=6 at T=11 as above.\n\nBefore T=8: at T=7, I am at y=2, which is before y=6.\n\nSo I cannot reach y=6 before T=8 from y=1 at T=6.\n\nMin time to y=6 is T=11.\n\nThen to y=9 T=14.\n\nBut T=14 is before the dangers at y=7 and y=8 which start at T=16, so no issue.\n\nBut H=10 actions.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster by not going all the way down.\n\nAnother idea: at T=4, y=3, I go down to y=2 at T=5.\n\nThen at T=5, y=2, instead of going down to y=1, can I go up or something? But at T=6, I need to be safe, so if I go up to y=3 at T=6, unsafe.\n\nOr stay y=2, unsafe.\n\nOr down to y=1, safe.\n\nNo choice.\n\nPerhaps I can stay at y=3 for multiple turns, but at T=6, I must leave, but I can only go to y=2,3,4, all unsafe.\n\nUnless I go at a time when it is safe, but at T=6, it is unsafe.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, the path I have seems necessary.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on y=6.\n\nFreeway 6: occupied at T=8 and T=9.\n\nIn my path, I am at y=6 at T=11, which is fine.\n\nNow, for y=7 and y=8, dangers at T=16,17,18 etc., but I reach y=9 at T=14, before that, so no problem.\n\nBut can I reach earlier than T=14?\n\nFor example, if I could be at higher y at T=6.\n\nBut I cannot, as established.\n\nSuppose at T=4, I go down to y=2 at T=5.\n\nThen at T=5, y=2, I go down to y=1 at T=6, as before.\n\nIf at T=5, I go up, to y=3 at T=6, unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=0 or something, but worse.\n\nSo I think T=14 is the earliest possible.\n\nBut let's see if I can save a turn later.\n\nFor example, from y=1 at T=6, to y=9, min 8 moves, arriving at T=14.\n\ny=1 to y=9, delta y=8, so min 8 moves, to T=6+8=14.\n\nT=6 y=1, after k moves, at T=6+k, y=1+k if all up.\n\nSet y=9 at T, so T=6 + (9-1) =14 if no delays.\n\nBut in this case, no delays, so T=14.\n\nAnd I have to go through the down at the beginning.\n\nSo H=10 actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions from t=4 to t=13.\n\nNow, let's write the actions.\n\nStart: turn 4, y=3\n\nTo be at y=1 at turn 6.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 4: action D (down to y=2 at turn 5)\n\nTurn 5: action D (down to y=1 at turn 6)\n\nNow turn 6: at y=1, action U (up to y=2 at turn 7)\n\nTurn 7: at y=2, action U (to y=3 at turn 8)\n\nTurn 8: at y=3, action U (to y=4 at turn 9)\n\nTurn 9: at y=4, action U (to y=5 at turn 10)\n\nTurn 10: at y=5, action U (to y=6 at turn 11)\n\nTurn 11: at y=6, action U (to y=7 at turn 12)\n\nTurn 12: at y=7, action U (to y=8 at turn 13)\n\nTurn 13: at y=8, action U (to y=9 at turn 14)\n\nAt turn 14, y=9, done.\n\nNow, check for collisions.\n\nAt each turn, position and if on freeway, check if occupied.\n\nTurn 4: y=3, freeway 3. At T=4, no car at x=0, safe.\n\nTurn 5: y=2, freeway 2. At T=5, only y=1 occupied, y=2 safe? Freeway 2 occupied at T=6, not T=5, so safe.\n\nTurn 6: y=1, freeway 1. At T=6, freeway 1 occupied only at T=5, not T=6, so safe.\n\nTurn 7: y=2, freeway 2. At T=7, freeway 2 only occupied at T=6, not T=7, safe.\n\nTurn 8: y=3, freeway 3. At T=8, only occupied at T=6, safe.\n\nTurn 9: y=4, freeway 4. Occupied only at T=6, safe at T=9.\n\nTurn 10: y=5, freeway 5. Occupied only at T=6, safe.\n\nTurn 11: y=6, freeway 6. Occupied at T=8 and T=9, not T=11, safe.\n\nTurn 12: y=7, freeway 7. Occupied at T=16,17,18, not T=12, safe.\n\nTurn 13: y=8, freeway 8. Occupied at T=16-19, not T=13, safe.\n\nTurn 14: y=9, not a freeway, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, is there a shorter way?\n\nSuppose I don't go all the way to y=1.\n\nFor example, at T=4, y=3, I go down to y=2 at T=5.\n\nThen at T=5, y=2, I must go to y=1 at T=6 to be safe.\n\nIf I could be at y=6 at T=6, but impossible.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps at T=6, I can be at y=0, but same as y=1.\n\nOr, but y=0 might not be necessary.\n\nPerhaps I can go up later faster, but no.\n\nNotice that y=6 is dangerous at T=8 and T=9, but since I am not there, fine.\n\nIn the path, I have to take two down actions first, which cost.\n\nBut necessary to avoid T=6.\n\nPerhaps I can stay at y=3 for one turn, but at T=5 y=3, then at T=6 must move, but unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach y=9 in fewer than 10 actions.\n\nSuppose I start at T=4 y=3, go up to y=4 at T=5.\n\nThen at T=5, y=4, I go down to y=3 at T=6? But y=3 unsafe at T=6.\n\nCollision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nGo down to y=2 at T=6, unsafe.\n\nAll not possible.\n\nSo must go down to y=1 or below at T=6.\n\nThus, minimal H=10.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions from t=4 to t=13.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to list the actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 13, I go to y=9 at turn 14.\n\nBut in the action list, I have actions up to turn 13.\n\nNow, for freeway 7 and 8, dangers late, but I arrive early, so fine.\n\nBut is there a way to save time by going directly or something.\n\nAnother thought: at T=4, y=3, if I go up to y=4 at T=5.\n\nThen at T=5, y=4, instead of moving vertically, I have to move to y=3,4,5 at T=6, all bad.\n\nUnless I can be on a row with no car, but all middle rows occupied at T=6.\n\nPerhaps I can move to y=6 at some point, but from y=4 at T=5, to y=6 at T=6? Impossible, only one move.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, I think the sequence is correct.\n\nNow, but in the beginning, for freeway 3, at T=4, I am on it, but safe.\n\nNow, the action sequence:\n\nTurn 4: D\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut let's write it properly.\n\nAlso, H=10.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nSuppose I go to y=1 at T=6, but then from there, I can go up faster? No, min 8 moves to y=9.\n\nPerhaps I can delay or something to avoid, but no need.\n\nAnother idea: at T=6, I am at y=1, but y=6 is dangerous at T=8 and T=9.\n\nIf I could be at y=6 at T=7, but impossible from y=1 at T=6.\n\nOr at T=10, but later.\n\nBut in the path, I am at T=11, which is fine.\n\nSuppose from T=6 y=1, I go up to T=7 y=2.\n\nThen at T=7 y=2, I could stay or something, but I need to go up.\n\nIf I stay at y=2 at T=8, y=2 is safe, since only dangerous at T=6.\n\nThen at T=8, y=2, I go up to y=3 at T=9, and so on.\n\nBut then I arrive later.\n\nFor example:\n\nT=6 y=1, U to y=2 T=7\n\nT=7 y=2, S (stay) to y=2 T=8? Action S, y_{t+1} = y_t if S.\n\nAt T=7, if a7=S, then y8 = y7 =2 at T=8.\n\nThen T=8 y=2, a8=U, y9=3 at T=9\n\nThen to y=4 T=10, y=5 T=11, y=6 T=12, y=7 T=13, y=8 T=14, y=9 T=15.\n\nArrive at T=15, later than 14.\n\nWorse.\n\nGo directly: T=6 y=1, U to y=2 T=7\n\nU to y=3 T=8\n\nU to y=4 T=9\n\nU to y=5 T=10\n\nU to y=6 T=11, same as before.\n\nNo savings.\n\nThus, minimal is T=14 with H=10 actions.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I have 10 actions: t=4 to t=13.\n\nNow, for the output.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, there are cars, but I pass them early, so no issue.\n\nNow, one thing: in freeway 7, there is a car at (16,5,right,4), but I am on y=7 at T=12, and the car is at x=0 only at later times, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 10.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 4: D\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut let's write it as per the box.\n\nAlso, in the sequence, at turn 13, action U to go to y=9 at turn 14.\n\nBut since we arrive at turn 14, which is t_1 + H -1 =4 +10 -1=13? t_1 + H -1=4+10-1=13, but at turn 13, y=8, not 9.\n\nProblem: t_1 + H -1 should be the turn when y=9.\n\nIn my case, at turn 14, y=9.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =14.\n\nt_1=4, so 4 + H -1 =14, H=11.\n\nBut with 10 actions? Contradiction.\n\nI think I have a confusion in indexing.\n\nLet me define.\n\nSet t_1 =4.\n\nAt turn t=4, position y=3.\n\nI take actions a_t for t=4,5,6,..., up to a_{T-1} to reach y_T=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=4 to t=T-1 inclusive.\n\nNumber of actions: (T-1) - 4 +1 = T-4.\n\nFor example, T=14, actions from t=4 to 13, 10 actions, H=10.\n\nThen t_1 + H -1 =4 +10 -1=13, but at turn 13, we are at y13, which is 8, not 9.\n\ny13=8, then after a13=U, y14=9.\n\nSo at turn 14, y=9.\n\nBut t_1 + H -1 =13, which is turn 13, y=8 ≠9.\n\nInconsistency with the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nIn this case, for y to be 9 at turn K, we need K = t_1 + H -1.\n\nWith actions from t=t_1 to t=K-1.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1 of a_{t_1 + t}, so for t=0, a_{t_1}, t=1, a_{t_1+1}, ..., t=H-1, a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nThen at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo, for example, to have y_K=9 at turn K, with K = t_1 + H -1.\n\nThen actions are a_{t_1} to a_{K-1}, but K-1 = (t_1 + H -1) -1 = t_1 + H -2.\n\nThe actions are from index t_1 to t_1 + H -1, but a_{t_1 + H -1} is the last action, which sets y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, so the action before that sets it.\n\nI think I need to include the action at turn t_1 + H -1 to stay or something, but since we are already at 9, we can stay, but in this case, we arrive by moving up.\n\nFor instance, in my sequence, at turn 13, y=8, I take U to go to y=9 at turn 14.\n\nBut if I want to be at y=9 at turn 13, I need to be there at turn 13 with some action.\n\nBut from turn 12 y=7, I take U to y=8 at turn 13, not y=9.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn K, I need to have moved to it by action at turn K-1.\n\nSo for K=13, y13=9, which requires at turn 12, y12=8 or 9, and action to set y13=9.\n\nBut in my case, I can only reach y=9 at turn 14.\n\nSuppose I want to arrive at turn 13.\n\nThen y13=9.\n\nFrom start y4=3, in 9 steps? From turn 4 to turn 13, that's 9 turns later, but positions.\n\nAt turn 4, y=3.\n\nAfter 9 actions, at turn 13, y=9.\n\nDelta y=6, so possible if all up, but with cars, may not.\n\nMin turns: from y=3 to y=9, min 6 up moves, so at least turn 10 if start moving up immediately.\n\nTurn 4: y=3\n\na4=U, turn 5 y=4\n\na5=U, turn 6 y=5\n\nBut at turn 6, y=5 occupied, collision.\n\nIf I go up at turn 4 to y=4 at turn 5.\n\nThen at turn 5, to avoid turn 6, I need to be not on y=2,3,4,5, impossible from y=4.\n\nSo cannot reach by turn 10.\n\nEarliest possible is turn 14 as before.\n\nTo have y at turn K=13.\n\ny13=9.\n\nThen from y4=3, need to increase by 6 in 9 steps, but with constraints.\n\nBut at turn 6, I must be at safe row, y=0 or1 or6,7,8,9, but from y=3 at turn 4, by turn 6, I can be at y=1,2,3,4,5, so only y=1 possible.\n\nThen at turn 6 y=1.\n\nThen to y=9 at turn 13, which is 7 moves: from turn 6 to turn 13, 7 actions, y from 1 to 9, delta 8, so impossible in 7 moves, min 8 moves to increase 8.\n\ny=1 to y=9, need 8 up moves, so min 8 actions, from turn 6 to turn 14.\n\nTurn 6 y=1, after 8 up actions, at turn 14 y=9.\n\nCannot at turn 13.\n\nThus, minimal T=14, H=10 actions.\n\nIn terms of t_1 + H -1=14, H=11? t_1 + H -1=4 + H -1=14, so H=11.\n\nBut number of actions is 10.\n\nI think the indexing is off.\n\nPerhaps the sequence includes the action at the arrival turn, but since we are already there, we can have S or something.\n\nBut in this case, to have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, with actions from t=0 to H-1.\n\nFor example, if I am at y=9 at turn K, I can have action S or U or D, but position stays if S, but I am already at 9.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn K, if I am at y=9, I might not need to take action, but the sequence includes actions up to a_{t_1 + H -1} for the turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nSuppose at turn t_1 + H -1, I am at y=9, so I don't move, or I can stay.\n\nIn the action, I can choose S.\n\nBut in this case, for arrival at turn 14, with H such that t_1 + H -1=14.\n\nWith actions from t=4 to t=13, 10 actions, but t=13 is turn 13, action a13 sets y14=9.\n\nBut at turn 13, I am not at y=9.\n\nTo have at turn 14 y=9, with a13 setting it.\n\nBut the turn t_1 + H -1=14 should have y=9.\n\nSo for the sequence, actions from t=4 to t=13 for H=10, t_1 + H -1=4+10-1=13, not 14.\n\nIf H=11, actions from t=4 to t=14, but t=14 action sets y15, not needed.\n\nI think there is a mistake in the problem interpretation.\n\nLet me read the problem carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"\n\n\"such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nAnd \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" which means a_{t_1}, a_{t_1 +1}, ..., a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nFor example, t=0, a_{t_1}, t=1, a_{t_1+1}, ..., t=H-1, a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nThen after taking these H actions, at turn (t_1 + H -1) +1? No.\n\nAfter taking action a_t at turn t, we set y_{t+1}.\n\nSo after taking a_{t_1 + H -1} at turn t_1 + H -1, we set y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9 at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nThis means that at the turn when we take the last action, we are already at y=9.\n\nSo for turn t_1 + H -1, we are at position y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, and then we take action a_{t_1 + H -1}, which could be S, U, or D, but since we are at 9, if U or D might go out of bound, but y in [0,9], so U from 9 might go to 10, not allowed, so we must choose S or D, but D to 8, not 9.\n\nSo to stay at 9, we must choose S.\n\nIn this case, for the arrival turn, we are at y=9 and we take S.\n\nBut in the sequence, we include the action at the arrival turn.\n\nFor example, to be at y=9 at turn K, with K = t_1 + H -1.\n\nThen at turn K, we are at y_K=9, and we take action a_K, which should be S to stay, or if we move, we leave.\n\nBut since we reached, we take S.\n\nThen the actions include a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, with a_{t_1 + H -1} = S at turn K.\n\nIn terms of the path, we need to arrive at y=9 before or at turn K.\n\nIn this case, for K=14, at turn 14, y=9, take a14=S.\n\nThen actions from t=4 to t=14, H=11 actions.\n\nBut the moving actions are from t=4 to t=13 to go to y=9 at t=14, then at t=14, action S.\n\nBut the position is reached at t=14 before action.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence, we can have.\n\nFor minimal H, since we reach at t=14, we need K=14, so t_1 + H -1=14, 4 + H -1=14, H=11.\n\nActions: a4 to a14, with a14=S.\n\nBut a4 to a13 are the moving actions, a14 is stay.\n\nIn the count, H=11 includes the stay action at the end.\n\nOtherwise, if we don't include, H=10 for moving, but then t_1 + H -1=13, y13=8 not 9.\n\nSo to satisfy the format, we must include the stay or final action.\n\nIn this case, for the path, we can add a stay at the end.\n\nSo sequence: actions from turn 4 to turn 13 as before, and at turn 14, action S, but turn 14 is when we are at y=9.\n\nLet's list.\n\nTurn 4: D  (to y=2 at t=5)\n\nTurn 5: D  (to y=1 at t=6)\n\nTurn 6: U  (to y=2 at t=7)\n\nTurn 7: U  (to y=3 at t=8)\n\nTurn 8: U  (to y=4 at t=9)\n\nTurn 9: U  (to y=5 at t=10)\n\nTurn 10: U  (to y=6 at t=11)\n\nTurn 11: U  (to y=7 at t=12)\n\nTurn 12: U  (to y=8 at t=13)\n\nTurn 13: U  (to y=9 at t=14)\n\nThen at turn 14, we are at y=9, and to have y_{14}=9, we take action a14=S.\n\nThen H=11, actions a4 to a14.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =4 +11 -1=14, y14=9.\n\nAnd actions from t=0 to H-1: a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1} = a4 to a14.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 4 to turn 14.\n\nIn the output, for turn 14, action S.\n\nBut in the action, at turn 14, taking S keeps y15=9, but we don't care after.\n\nSince we reached at turn 14, and we take S to stay.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 13, I have U to go to y=9 at t=14.\n\nThen at turn 14, S.\n\nBut the position is reached at turn 14.\n\nIf I want to reach at turn 13, I cannot, as established.\n\nSo for minimal H, with H=11 including the stay.\n\nBut the moving part is 10 actions to reach, plus one stay.\n\nIn terms of number of turns to reach, it's 10 actions to arrive at turn 14.\n\nBut according to the problem, H=11 with the stay action.\n\nI think it's better to follow the format.\n\nSo in the sequence:\n\nTurn 4: D\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U  (now at turn 14, y=9)\n\nTurn 14: S  (to stay at y=9 for turn 15, but we are at turn 14 position)\n\nAt turn 13: action U, sets y14=9.\n\nThen at turn 14, we are at y=9, and we take action a14, which for the sequence, to have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9 at turn t_1 + H -1=14, we take a14=S to keep it.\n\nThen for the answer, H=11.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 4: D\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nBut turn 14 action S sets y15=9, but we are already at y14=9.\n\nIn the position, at turn 14, y=9.\n\nThen action S keeps it for turn 15.\n\nBut for the reach at turn 14, it is fine.\n\nPerhaps we can avoid the extra action by reaching earlier, but cannot.\n\nSo I think for the format, we need to include it.\n\nIn the sequence, when we take the last action a_{t_1 + H -1}, we are at position y_{t_1 + H -1} before the action, and after action, y_{t_1 + H} is set.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, so before taking action at that turn, we are at 9.\n\nThen we take some action.\n\nFor example, at turn K=14, y14=9, then take a14.\n\nBut to have y14=9, it must be set by previous actions.\n\nIn this case, with a13=U from y13=8 to y14=9.\n\nThen at turn 14, we are at y14=9.\n\nThen for the sequence, to have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, with K=14= t_1 + H -1, so H=11.\n\nThen actions a4 to a14, with a14 being the action at turn 14 when we are at y=9.\n\nSince y=9, we can choose S to stay, or if we choose U, y15=10 invalid, so must choose S or D, but D to 8, not good, so must choose S to remain at 9.\n\nSo in the sequence, a14=S.\n\nBut it is an extra action.\n\nPerhaps for minimal H, since we reach at turn 14, H should be 10 for the moving actions, but the format requires y at the turn of the last action.\n\nI think we have to go with the format.\n\nSo for this, H=11.\n\nActions as above.\n\nIn the output, for turn 14, action S.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach at turn 13.\n\nSuppose at some point I move faster.\n\nFor example, from y=1 at T=6, if I could go up faster, but cannot.\n\nOr, at T=4, instead of going down twice, but I have to.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nThus, the sequence is:\n\nTurn 4: D\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nWith H=11.\n\nBut in the action list, turn 13 U to go to y=9 at t=14, turn 14 S to stay.\n\nFor the answer, I think we can write the sequence as per the format.\n\nPerhaps the problem considers the position after action, but the collision is checked at the turn position before action.\n\nI think it's better to submit the sequence.\n\nSo for the box.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 4\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 11. The sequence of actions ensures the player arrives at (0, 9) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 4 + 11 - 1 = 14\\).\n\nThe actions are determined to avoid all dangerous times when cars are at \\(x = 0\\) on each freeway:\n- Freeway 1 (\\(y = 1\\)) is occupied only at turn 5.\n- Freeways 2, 3, 4, and 5 (\\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5\\)) are all occupied at turn 6.\n- Freeway 6 (\\(y = 6\\)) is occupied at turns 8 and 9.\n- Freeway 7 (\\(y = 7\\)) is occupied at turns 16, 17, and 18.\n- Freeway 8 (\\(y = 8\\)) is occupied at turns 16, 17, 18, and 19.\n\nStarting from turn 4 at \\(y = 3\\):\n- At turn 4, moving down to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 5 avoids being on \\(y = 3\\) at turn 6 (dangerous) and \\(y = 2\\) is safe at turn 5.\n- At turn 5, moving down to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 6 places the player on a safe row at turn 6, as \\(y = 1\\) is only dangerous at turn 5.\n- From turn 6 to turn 13, moving up consistently reaches higher rows, avoiding dangerous times:\n  - \\(y = 6\\) is dangerous at turns 8 and 9, but the player is at \\(y = 3\\) at turn 8 and \\(y = 4\\) at turn 9, both safe.\n  - The player reaches \\(y = 6\\) at turn 11, after the dangerous turns 8 and 9.\n  - \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) are dangerous starting at turn 16, but the player passes them earlier (turns 12 and 13), so they are safe.\n- At turn 13, moving up reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 14.\n- At turn 14, the player is at \\(y = 9\\), and staying (action S) ensures the position remains at (0, 9) for subsequent turns, satisfying the requirement to reach (0, 9) at turn 14.\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 4: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ S} } \n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in \\(H = 11\\) turns, with the player at (0, 9) at turn 14.",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 2) on turn t_1 = 5. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9. Since we're starting from y=2 and going to y=9, we'll probably want to move up most of the time.\n\nCollision occurs only if at the turn when the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, at that exact turn, the car's span includes x=0. The note says that when you move to a new y, you're not on that new y until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, you're on y at turn T, and on y+1 at turn T+1. So you only check collision for the freeway you're currently on at that turn.\n\nAlso, the car spans are given for turn t_1=5, and they move left or right based on their direction and speed. For left-moving cars, the span moves left as time increases, and for right-moving, it moves right.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions from turn 5 onwards to reach y=9 as quickly as possible without colliding.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their states at turn 5.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, head=0, tail=-47, direction=right, speed=48. Since it's right-moving, head should be greater than tail? In the update rule, for right-moving, span is [τ, h], so tail τ, head h, with τ < h.\n\nIn the table, it says \"head h, tail τ\", but for direction, it might imply the order.\n\nLook: for right-moving, it says \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" and for left-moving \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ]\". But in the car state, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed).\n\nFor freeway 1: (head=0, tail=-47, dir=right, speed=48)\n\nSince direction is right, the span should be [tail, head] = [-47, 0] at t=5. Head is the front, I think.\n\nIn the update, for right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left: [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nAt turn T, collision if player is on freeway k at turn T, and 0 is in Span(T) for that car on freeway k.\n\nNow, for freeway 1: at t=5, span for the car is, since right-moving, [τ, h] = [-47, 0]\n\nNow, at time T, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-5), h + s(T-5)] = [-47 + 48(T-5), 0 + 48(T-5)] = [-47 + 48Δ, 48Δ] where Δ = T-5\n\n0 is in the span if -47 + 48Δ ≤ 0 ≤ 48Δ\n\nSince 48Δ ≥ 0, the right inequality is always true if 0 ≤ 48Δ, which for Δ≥0, yes.\n\nLeft: -47 + 48Δ ≤ 0 ⇒ 48Δ ≤ 47 ⇒ Δ ≤ 47/48\n\nSince Δ = T-5 is integer, Δ ≤ 0 because 47/48 <1, so Δ=0.\n\n-47 + 48Δ ≤ 0 ⇒ 48Δ ≤ 47 ⇒ Δ ≤ 47/48 ≈ 0.979, so for integer Δ, only Δ=0, T=5.\n\nThen 0 ≤ 48Δ is true for Δ≥0, but at Δ=0, 0 ≤ 0 is true, but the span is [-47,0] at T=5, so x=0 is included? Let's see.\n\nAt T=5, span is [-47,0], so x from -47 to 0 inclusive? [τ, h] = [-47,0], so it includes x=0.\n\nAnd since it's a closed interval, I assume, it includes endpoints.\n\nSo at T=5, for freeway 1, 0 is in [-47,0], so if player is on y=1 at turn 5, collision.\n\nBut player starts at y=2, so not on y=1 yet.\n\nFor other turns, when Δ≥1, -47 + 48Δ ≥ -47 +48 =1 >0, so the left end is greater than 0, so 0 not in [something positive, larger positive], so no collision for T>5.\n\nSimilarly, for Δ=0, only T=5.\n\nSo freeway 1 has a car only at T=5 that covers x=0.\n\nNow freeway 2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: head=-12, tail=-23, direction=right, speed=12\n\nSince right-moving, span at t=5 is [τ, h] = [-23, -12]\n\nAt T, Span(T) = [-23 + 12Δ, -12 + 12Δ] where Δ=T-5\n\n0 in span if -23 +12Δ ≤ 0 ≤ -12 +12Δ\n\nFirst, -23 +12Δ ≤ 0 ⇒ 12Δ ≤ 23 ⇒ Δ ≤ 23/12 ≈ 1.916, so Δ=0,1\n\nSecond, 0 ≤ -12 +12Δ ⇒ 12 ≤ 12Δ ⇒ Δ ≥1\n\nSo both: Δ≥1 and Δ≤1.916, so Δ=1\n\nFor Δ=1, -23+12= -11 ≤0? -11≤0 true, and 0≤ -12+12=0, 0≤0 true, so at Δ=1, T=6, 0 in [-11,0]? Span is [-23+12Δ, -12+12Δ]\n\nAt Δ=1: [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11, 0], so yes, x=0 included.\n\nFor other Δ, not.\n\nSecond car on freeway 2: head=60, tail=49, direction=right, speed=12\n\nSpan at t=5: [τ, h] = [49,60]\n\nAt T: [49 +12Δ, 60 +12Δ]\n\n0 in this? 49+12Δ ≥49>0, so min is 49>0, so 0 not in [49+, 60+], never.\n\nSo for freeway 2, only one car that affects: at T=6, when Δ=1, span includes x=0.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? Cars: (-12,-23,right,12) and (60,49,right,12)\n\nExactly same as freeway 2.\n\nFirst car: head=-12, tail=-23, right, speed=12 → same as above, at T=6, span [-11,0] includes 0.\n\nSecond car: (60,49,right,12) → [49,60] at t=5, moves to right, never covers x=0.\n\nSo freeway 3 has collision only at T=6.\n\nNow freeway 4: (12,47,left,36)\n\nDirection left, so head=12, tail=47? But for left-moving, span is [h, τ] = [12,47] at t=5.\n\nUpdate: Span(T) = [h - sΔ, τ - sΔ] = [12 - 36Δ, 47 - 36Δ]\n\n0 in span if 12-36Δ ≤ 0 ≤ 47-36Δ\n\nFirst, 12-36Δ ≤ 0 ⇒ 12 ≤ 36Δ ⇒ Δ ≥ 12/36 = 1/3 ≈0.333, so Δ≥1 since integer\n\nSecond, 0 ≤ 47-36Δ ⇒ 36Δ ≤ 47 ⇒ Δ ≤ 47/36 ≈ 1.305, so Δ=1\n\nAt Δ=1, [12-36, 47-36] = [-24, 11], so -24 ≤ 0 ≤ 11, yes, 0 included.\n\nFor other Δ, no.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 4? (12,47,left,36) → same as above, collision at T=6 (Δ=1)\n\nΔ=T-5, T=6, Δ=1.\n\nNow freeway 6: (-18,-29,right,6)\n\nOne car, head=-18, tail=-29, direction=right, speed=6\n\nRight-moving, span at t=5: [τ, h] = [-29, -18]\n\nAt T: [-29 +6Δ, -18 +6Δ]\n\n0 in span if -29+6Δ ≤ 0 ≤ -18+6Δ\n\nFirst: -29+6Δ ≤ 0 ⇒ 6Δ ≤ 29 ⇒ Δ ≤ 29/6 ≈4.833, so Δ≤4\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -18+6Δ ⇒ 18 ≤ 6Δ ⇒ Δ ≥ 3\n\nSo both: Δ≥3 and Δ≤4.833, so Δ=3,4\n\nAt Δ=3: [-29+18, -18+18] = [-11, 0], includes 0\n\nAt Δ=4: [-29+24, -18+24] = [-5,6], includes 0\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-44,-55,right,4)\n\nRight-moving, span at t=5: [τ, h] = [-55, -44]? Head=-44, tail=-55, so τ=-55, h=-44, so [ -55, -44]\n\nAt T: [-55 +4Δ, -44 +4Δ]\n\n0 in span if -55+4Δ ≤ 0 ≤ -44+4Δ\n\nFirst: -55+4Δ ≤ 0 ⇒ 4Δ ≤ 55 ⇒ Δ ≤ 55/4=13.75, so Δ≤13\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -44+4Δ ⇒ 44 ≤ 4Δ ⇒ Δ ≥ 11\n\nSo Δ from 11 to 13 inclusive.\n\nSecond car on freeway 7: (20,9,right,4)\n\nHead=20, tail=9, direction=right, so span [τ,h] = [9,20]\n\nAt T: [9+4Δ, 20+4Δ], min 9>0, so never covers 0.\n\nSo freeway 7 has collision when Δ=11,12,13, i.e., T=16,17,18? Δ=T-5, so T=16,17,18.\n\nBut we might not go there soon, but need to check.\n\nNow freeway 8: (-33,-44,right,3)\n\nOne car, head=-33, tail=-44, direction=right, speed=3\n\nSpan at t=5: [τ,h] = [-44, -33]\n\nAt T: [-44 +3Δ, -33 +3Δ]\n\n0 in span if -44+3Δ ≤ 0 ≤ -33+3Δ\n\nFirst: -44+3Δ ≤ 0 ⇒ 3Δ ≤ 44 ⇒ Δ ≤ 44/3 ≈14.666, so Δ≤14\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -33+3Δ ⇒ 33 ≤ 3Δ ⇒ Δ ≥ 11\n\nSo Δ from 11 to 14 inclusive. T=16,17,18,19.\n\nNow, player starts at y=2 at turn 5.\n\nWe need to go to y=9, so we need to move up 7 times, but we can stay or move down, but that might not help, so minimal turns should be 7 if no obstacles, but there are cars on freeways.\n\nThe freeways with cars are y=1 to 8, and we start at y=2, so we need to pass through y=3,4,5,6,7,8 to reach 9.\n\nBut at each turn, when we are on a freeway, we must not have collision.\n\nAlso, since we start at turn 5, and actions from turn 5.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway, the turns when collision happens, i.e., when x=0 is covered.\n\ny=1: only at T=5\n\ny=2: no cars? Freeway 2 is y=2? Freeway k for y=k.\n\nIn the table, freeway k, so y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nBut for y=2, we have cars? Freeway 2 has cars, but do they cover x=0 at some turn?\n\nFor y=2, freeway 2: we have collision at T=6, as above.\n\nSimilarly, y=3: same as y=2, collision at T=6.\n\ny=4: freeway 4, collision at T=6.\n\ny=5: freeway 5, collision at T=6.\n\ny=6: freeway 6, collision at T=8 and T=9? Δ=3 and 4, T=5+3=8, T=5+4=9.\n\ny=7: freeway 7, collision at T=16,17,18\n\ny=8: freeway 8, collision at T=16,17,18,19\n\nBut T=16 is far, we might reach before that.\n\nPlayer at turn 5, y=2.\n\nGoal: reach y=9.\n\ny=9 has no cars, since cars only on y=1 to 8.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need to be on y=8 at some turn and move up to y=9 at the next turn.\n\nWhen we move to y=9, we are not on y=8 or y=9 during the move in a way that causes collision? At turn T, if we are on y=8, we must not collide with cars on y=8. Then at turn T, we take action U, so at turn T+1, we are on y=9, and since no cars on y=9, no collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we are on y=9, no issue.\n\nBut to get to y=9, we need to be on y=8 at some turn and move up.\n\nMinimal H: if we go up every turn, we can reach in 7 turns: from y=2 to y=9, difference 7, so turns: start turn 5 y=2, after one up, turn 6 y=3, turn 7 y=4, ..., up to turn 11 y=8, then turn 12 y=9.\n\nLet's list:\n\nTurn 5: y=2\n\nAction at turn t affects y at t+1.\n\nPlayer update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, we take action a_t, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nPosition at turn t is given, then we choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + delta.\n\nCollision at turn T if on freeway y_T, and car on that freeway has 0 in span at T.\n\nIn the sequence, at each turn, we have y_t, and we check for that y_t and turn T=t.\n\nNow, for minimal path to y=9.\n\nIf we always go up:\n\nStart: turn 5, y=2\n\nTake a_5: if U, then y6 = 3\n\nBut at turn 6, if y=3, is there collision?\n\ny=3 is freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 3 has collision at turn 6, as we saw earlier.\n\nAt turn 6, on y=3, and car on y=3 has span including x=0, so collision.\n\nCannot be on y=3 at turn 6.\n\nIf we take S at turn 5, y6 = y5 =2\n\nAt turn 6, y=2, freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2 also has collision at turn 6, as we saw.\n\ny=2 at turn 6: collision.\n\ny=4 at turn 6 also collision, etc.\n\nLet's list for each turn, which freeways have collision.\n\nTurn T | Collision on freeways (y)\n\nAt T=5: y=1 has collision, as per freeway 1.\n\ny=2: freeway 2, at T=5, is there collision? Earlier for y=2, freeway 2 at T=5.\n\nFreeway 2, first car: at T=5, Δ=0, span [-23,-12], which is from -23 to -12, all negative, x=0 not included? -12 to -23, left of zero, so 0 not in [-23,-12], since -23 < -12 <0, so 0 not in interval.\n\nSimilarly, second car [49,60], not.\n\nSo at T=5, freeway 2 no collision.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: at T=5, cars: first span [-23,-12], not cover 0; second [49,60], not. So no collision.\n\nFreeway 4: at T=5, left-moving car, span [12,47], both positive, not cover 0.\n\nFreeway 5: similar, no.\n\nFreeway 6: at T=5, right-moving, span [-29,-18], negative, not cover 0.\n\nFreeway 7: first car [-55,-44], negative; second [9,20], positive, not cover 0.\n\nFreeway 8: [-44,-33], negative, not cover 0.\n\nSo at T=5, only y=1 has collision.\n\nPlayer is at y=2, which is safe at T=5.\n\nNow T=6: as before, y=1: no collision for T>5.\n\ny=2: freeway 2, at T=6, Δ=1, first car span [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], includes 0. Second car not. So collision on y=2 at T=6.\n\ny=3: freeway 3, same as y=2, collision at T=6.\n\ny=4: freeway 4, at T=6, Δ=1, span [12-36,47-36]=[-24,11], includes 0.\n\ny=5: freeway 5, same, collision.\n\ny=6: freeway 6, at T=6, Δ=1, span [-29+6, -18+6]=[-23,-12], not cover 0? -23 to -12, all negative, 0 not in.\n\nΔ=1, T=6, but collision for y=6 at Δ=3 and 4, T=8,9.\n\nAt T=6, Δ=1, span [-29+6, -18+6] = [-23,-12], min -23, max -12, both <0, so 0 not in, no collision.\n\nSimilarly y=7: at T=6, Δ=1, freeway 7 first car span [-55+4, -44+4]=[-51,-40], not cover 0; second not, so no.\n\ny=8: similar, no.\n\nSo at T=6, collision on y=2,3,4,5.\n\ny=1 is safe, but y=1 is below, we want to go up.\n\ny=6,7,8 safe at T=6.\n\nT=7: now Δ=2 for all.\n\ny=1: no collision.\n\ny=2: freeway 2 at T=7, Δ=2, first car span [-23+24, -12+24]=[1,12], min 1>0, so 0 not in. Second car not, so no collision on y=2.\n\nSimilarly y=3: same as y=2, no collision at T=7.\n\ny=4: freeway 4 at T=7, Δ=2, span [12-72,47-72]=[-60,-25], all negative, not cover 0.\n\ny=5: same, no collision.\n\ny=6: freeway 6 at T=7, Δ=2, span [-29+12, -18+12]=[-17,-6], negative, not cover 0.\n\ny=7: freeway 7 at T=7, Δ=2, first car [-55+8, -44+8]=[-47,-36], not; second not, no collision.\n\ny=8: similar.\n\nSo at T=7, all freeways are safe? No collision on any.\n\nT=8: Δ=3\n\ny=1: safe\n\ny=2: safe, as above\n\ny=3: safe\n\ny=4: safe\n\ny=5: safe\n\ny=6: freeway 6, at T=8, Δ=3, span [-29+18, -18+18]=[-11,0], includes 0, so collision on y=6.\n\ny=7: freeway 7, at T=8, Δ=3, first car [-55+12, -44+12]=[-43,-32], not cover 0; second not, so safe.\n\ny=8: freeway 8, at T=8, Δ=3, span [-44+9, -33+9]=[-35,-24], negative, not cover 0.\n\nBut y=6 has collision.\n\nT=9: Δ=4\n\ny=6: freeway 6, span [-29+24, -18+24]=[-5,6], includes 0, collision.\n\ny=7: at T=9, Δ=4, freeway 7 first car [-55+16, -44+16]=[-39,-28], not cover 0.\n\ny=8: freeway 8, span [-44+12, -33+12]=[-32,-21], not.\n\nBut y=6 collision.\n\nT=10: Δ=5\n\ny=6: freeway 6, span [-29+30, -18+30]=[1,12], min>0, no collision.\n\nSimilarly others safe until later.\n\ny=7 and y=8 have collisions later at T=16+, but that's far.\n\nBack to player.\n\nStart turn 5, y=2.\n\nWe want to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nPossible to go up directly, but at turn 6, if we go to y=3, collision since y=3 at T=6 has collision.\n\nIf we stay at y=2 at turn 5, then at turn 6, y=2, but at T=6, y=2 has collision, so cannot stay.\n\nAt turn 5, if we take S, y6=2, but at turn 6, on y=2, collision.\n\nIf we take D, y6=1, but at turn 6, y=1: at T=6, freeway 1, earlier we said no collision for T>5, so y=1 at T=6 is safe.\n\nBut y=1 is down, not helpful.\n\nWe could go down to avoid, but that might take more turns.\n\nSince at T=6, y=2,3,4,5 all have collision, so we cannot be on those at turn 6.\n\ny=1 is safe, y=6,7,8 are safe at T=6.\n\nBut we are at y=2 at turn 5.\n\nOptions at turn 5:\n\n- Take U: y6=3, but at turn 6, on y=3, collision. Bad.\n\n- Take S: y6=2, at turn 6, on y=2, collision. Bad.\n\n- Take D: y6=1, at turn 6, on y=1, which is safe, no collision.\n\nThen from there, we need to go up.\n\nBut y=1 at turn 6.\n\nThen turn 6: at y=1, we can take action.\n\nWe want to go to y=9.\n\nAt turn 7, as we saw, all freeways safe.\n\nSo from turn 6, y=1, we can go up to y=2 at turn 7.\n\nTurn 6: we are on y=1, take action.\n\nIf we take U, y7 = y6 +1 = 1+1=2\n\nAt turn 7, on y=2.\n\nAt T=7, as above, no collision on any freeway, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can go up.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nSince at T=6, we cannot be on y=2,3,4,5, but y=6,7,8 are safe, but we are at y=2, we can't jump.\n\nWe have to move step by step.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 5, take no action that puts us in danger at T=6.\n\nBut if we take D, we go to y=1 at T=6, safe.\n\nThen from y=1 at turn 6, we can go up to y=2 at turn 7.\n\nTurn 7 y=2 is safe.\n\nThen from there, we can go up to y=3 at turn 8.\n\nBut at turn 8, y=6 has collision, but y=3 at T=8: is there collision?\n\nAt T=8, which freeways have collision? Earlier: y=6 at T=8 has collision.\n\ny=3: at T=8, freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 3: cars, first at Δ=3, T=8, span [-23 + 36? Δ=T-5=3, s=12, so [-23 + 12*3, -12 + 12*3] = [-23+36, -12+36] = [13,24], min 13>0, not cover 0. Second car not. So no collision on y=3 at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, y=4,5, etc., all safe except y=6.\n\nSo y=3 at T=8 safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=4,5 safe at T=8.\n\nOnly y=6 unsafe at T=8.\n\nNow, back to sequence.\n\nPlayer:\n\nTurn 5: y=2\n\nTo avoid collision at T=6, since being on y=2,3,4,5 at T=6 causes collision, but at T=6, we can be on y=1 or y=6,7,8.\n\nBut from y=2, we can only go to y=1,2,3 at turn 6.\n\ny=1 is possible with D.\n\ny=2 with S, but collision.\n\ny=3 with U, collision.\n\nSo only safe choice is to go down to y=1 at turn 6.\n\nSo action at turn 5: D\n\nThen turn 6: y=1, safe.\n\nNow at turn 6, we are on y=1, we need to choose action for turn 6.\n\nWe want to go up.\n\nAt turn 7, all freeways safe, as per earlier.\n\nSo we can go up to y=2.\n\nTake a_6 = U, then y7 = y6 +1 = 1+1=2\n\nAt turn 7: y=2, and since T=7, no collision, safe.\n\nThen turn 7: at y=2, we can take U to go to y=3 at turn 8.\n\na_7 = U, y8 = 3\n\nAt turn 8: y=3, T=8, as above, no collision, safe.\n\nThen turn 8: at y=3, take U, y9 =4\n\nAt turn 9: y=4, T=9.\n\nT=9: Δ=4\n\ny=4: freeway 4, at T=9, span [12-36*4, 47-36*4]? s=36, Δ=4, [12-144, 47-144]=[-132,-97], negative, not cover 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 safe.\n\ny=6 at T=9 has collision, as earlier.\n\nBut we are on y=4 at turn 9, safe.\n\nThen turn 9: take U, y10=5\n\nAt turn 10: y=5, T=10.\n\nT=10: Δ=5\n\ny=5: freeway 5, span [12-36*5,47-36*5]=[12-180,47-180]=[-168,-133], not cover 0, safe.\n\ny=6: at T=10, Δ=5, span for freeway 6: [-29+30, -18+30]=[1,12], min>0, no collision, safe.\n\nEarlier collision only at T=8,9 for y=6.\n\nAt T=10, no collision.\n\nSimilarly all good.\n\nSo at turn 10, y=5, safe.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nFrom here, we can go up to y=6 at turn 11.\n\nturn 10: at y=5, take U, y11=6\n\nAt turn 11: y=6, T=11.\n\nT=11: Δ=6\n\ny=6: freeway 6, span [-29+36, -18+36]=[7,18], min>0, no collision, safe.\n\nThen turn 11: take U, y12=7\n\nAt turn 12: y=7, T=12.\n\nT=12: Δ=7\n\ny=7: freeway 7, first car span [-55+28, -44+28]=[-27,-16], not cover 0; second not, safe.\n\nThen turn 12: take U, y13=8\n\nAt turn 13: y=8, T=13.\n\nT=13: Δ=8\n\ny=8: freeway 8, span [-44+24, -33+24]=[-20,-9], negative, not cover 0, safe.\n\nThen turn 13: take U, y14=9\n\nAt turn 14: y=9, no cars, reached.\n\nBut is this minimal?\n\nWe used many turns: from turn 5 to turn 14, that's 10 turns? Let's count the actions.\n\nStart turn 5, position given.\n\nAfter H turns, we reach at turn t_1 + H - 1? The sequence is from t=0 to H-1, but t_1 is given.\n\nTurn t_1 =5, we take actions a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1}, and after H actions, we are at y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\ny_{t+1} after action.\n\nAt turn T, we take action a_T, then y_{T+1} is set.\n\nAt turn t_1, we are at y_{t_1}, take a_{t_1}, then y_{t_1 +1}, and so on, until at some turn, y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nThe minimal H such that y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn the answer, it should list actions starting from turn t_1.\n\nIn my sequence:\n\nStart turn 5, y=2\n\nAction a_5: D (to go down)\n\nThen y6=1\n\nTurn 6: a_6: U (up to y=2)\n\ny7=2\n\nTurn 7: a_7: U (to y=3)\n\ny8=3\n\nTurn 8: a_8: U (to y=4)\n\ny9=4\n\nTurn 9: a_9: U (to y=5)\n\ny10=5\n\nTurn 10: a_10: U (to y=6)\n\ny11=6\n\nTurn 11: a_11: U (to y=7)\n\ny12=7\n\nTurn 12: a_12: U (to y=8)\n\ny13=8\n\nTurn 13: a_13: U (to y=9)\n\ny14=9\n\nSo we reached y=9 at turn 14.\n\nNumber of actions: from a_5 to a_13, that's 9 actions? Turns: action at turn 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13: 9 actions.\n\nH is the number of turns for actions.\n\ny_{t_1 + H} = y_{5 + H} =9\n\nAfter H actions, y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn this case, y_{14} =9, t_1=5, so 5 + H =14, H=9.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nWe wasted one turn going down to y=1.\n\nPerhaps we can stay or something.\n\nAt turn 5, y=2, we must take action to avoid being on y=2,3,4,5 at T=6.\n\nBut with one action, we can only go to y=1,2,3.\n\ny=2 and y=3 unsafe, y=1 safe but down.\n\nWe cannot go directly to y=6 at turn 6.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps at turn 5, take S, but y6=2, collision at T=6.\n\nNot possible.\n\nOr take U, y6=3, collision.\n\nSo only D is possible to avoid collision immediately.\n\nBut perhaps we can delay.\n\nFor example, at turn 5, take no action? But S causes y6=2, collision.\n\nWe have to change y or stay.\n\nSince at T=7 all are safe, if we can be at y=2 at T=7, which is safe.\n\nBut to be at y=2 at turn 7, we need to be at y=2 at turn 6? No.\n\nPosition at turn T depends on previous actions.\n\nAt turn 5, if we take S, we are at y=2 at turn 6, but collision.\n\nIf we take D, at turn 6 y=1.\n\nThen at turn 6, from y=1, we can take S, then y7=1, but y=1 at turn 7 is safe, but we are at y=1, low.\n\nThen we need to go up later.\n\nBut that might take more time.\n\nAt turn 6, from y=1, take U to y=2 at turn 7, which is safe, as before.\n\nPerhaps from y=2 at turn 7, we can go up faster.\n\nBut in the sequence above, we went up continuously from turn 6 to 13, reaching y=9 at turn 14.\n\nBut we started from y=1 at turn 6.\n\nMinimal without obstacles: from y=2 to y=9, 7 steps up, 8 turns? Let's see.\n\nStart turn 5 y=2.\n\nAfter first U at turn 5: y6=3\n\nBut not possible due to collision.\n\nIf no cars, to reach y=9: from y=2, need 7 moves up, so actions at turn 5,6,7,8,9,10,11: U each, then y6=3, y7=4, ..., y12=9? Turn 5 action U, y6=3; turn6 U, y7=4; ... up to turn11 U, y12=9. So 7 actions, from turn5 to11, H=7, y_{5+7}=y12=9.\n\nBut with cars, we had to go down first, taking extra turns.\n\nIn our case, we used 9 actions.\n\nBut perhaps we can avoid going down.\n\nSince at T=6, y=6 is safe, but we can't reach it from y=2 in one step.\n\nUnless we move multiple steps, but we move one y per turn.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 5, we take D to y=1 at turn6, safe.\n\nThen at turn6, instead of going up immediately, we could stay or something, but that delays.\n\nNo, better to go up.\n\nPerhaps we can go up later when it's safe.\n\nFor example, at turn5, take D to y=1 at turn6.\n\nThen at turn6, take S, so y7=1, still at y=1.\n\nThen at turn7, take U to y=2 at turn8? Let's see times.\n\nTurn6: y=1, take S, then y7=1\n\nAt turn7: y=1, safe since T=7 no issue.\n\nThen turn7: take U, y8=2\n\nAt turn8: y=2, T=8, safe as before.\n\nThen go up as before, but now we have an extra stay, so it takes longer to reach y=9.\n\nFor example, y8=2, then U to y3 at turn9, and so on, up to y9 at turn15 or later, worse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nFrom y=1 at turn6, go directly to up, as in first sequence.\n\nBut in first sequence, we reached y=9 at turn14.\n\nCan we reach earlier?\n\nPerhaps we can be on a higher y when it's safe.\n\nFor example, at T=6, y=6 is safe, but we are at y=2, can't reach.\n\nAt T=7, all safe, so we can be on any y.\n\nAt turn5, y=2.\n\nIf we take S at turn5, y6=2, but collision at T=6, not possible.\n\nMust take D to y=1 at turn6.\n\nThen from turn6, y=1, we take U to y=2 at turn7.\n\nAt turn7, y=2.\n\nSince at T=7 all safe, we can go up multiple steps.\n\nFor example, from turn7 y=2, take U to y3 at turn8.\n\ny8=3\n\nThen turn8 take U to y4 at turn9.\n\ny9=4\n\nThen turn9 take U to y5 at turn10.\n\ny10=5\n\nThen turn10 take U to y6 at turn11.\n\ny11=6\n\nBut at turn11, y=6, T=11, which is safe, as span [7,18] no 0.\n\nThen turn11 take U to y7 at turn12.\n\ny12=7\n\nTurn12 U to y8 at turn13.\n\ny13=8\n\nTurn13 U to y9 at turn14.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut at turn10 y=5, we could go to y6 at turn11.\n\nIs there a way to be on y=6 earlier?\n\nFor example, at turn6, if we were on y=6, but we can't.\n\nAt turn7, we are on y=2, we go to y3 at turn8, etc., y6 at turn11.\n\nTurn11 is T=11, which is fine for y=6.\n\nBut y=6 has collision only at T=8 and T=9.\n\nT=8 and T=9 are dangerous for y=6.\n\nBut at T=11, safe.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nBut we are going through all.\n\nPerhaps we can go faster by skipping some levels when safe, but since we move one step at a time, not possible.\n\nAnother thought: since at T=6, y=6 is safe, if we could be there, but we can't from y=2.\n\nUnless we start from higher, but we start at y=2.\n\nPerhaps at turn5, we stay or something, but not possible.\n\nI think the first sequence is necessary to go down to avoid T=6 collision.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can stay at y=2 for multiple turns.\n\nAt turn5, if we take S, y6=2, collision at T=6.\n\nNot possible.\n\nTake U, collision.\n\nSo must go down.\n\nPerhaps at turn5, take D to y=1 at turn6.\n\nThen at turn6, instead of going to y=2 at turn7, we could go directly to higher, but no, only one step.\n\nSo I think minimal is H=9, with the sequence above.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach y=9 earlier.\n\nSuppose we go down at turn5 to y=1 at turn6.\n\nThen at turn6, we take U to y=2 at turn7.\n\nNow at turn7, y=2.\n\nInstead of going up step by step, we could stay or something, but that delays.\n\nSince at T=7 all safe, we can be on any y, but we are at y=2, we need to move up.\n\nThe fastest is to go up each turn.\n\nBut from y=2 at turn7 to y=9, that takes 7 moves: to y3 at turn8, y4 at turn9, ..., y9 at turn14.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf we start from y=2 at turn5, and go directly up, we could reach y9 at turn12, but blocked at turn6.\n\nSo yes, we lose two turns: one by going down and one by the delay.\n\nIn terms of turn count, we reach at turn14 instead of turn12.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, we have y=9 at turn14.\n\nBut is there a way to be on y=6 at a safe time earlier.\n\nFor example, if we can be on y=6 at turn10 or something.\n\nAt turn10, y=6 is safe, as we saw.\n\nHow to reach y=6 at turn10.\n\ny_{10} =6.\n\nNow, from start.\n\nAt turn5, y=2.\n\nAfter actions.\n\ny6 depends on a5.\n\nIf we want y10=6, that means from y2 to y6 in 5 steps? y10 is position at turn10.\n\ny_{t} at turn t.\n\ny5=2\n\ny10=6, so we need to increase y by 4 in 5 steps? From turn5 to turn10, 5 actions: a5 to a9.\n\ny6 = y5 + delta a5\n\ny7 = y6 + delta a6\n\n...\n\ny10 = y9 + delta a9\n\ny10 = y5 + sum_{t=5 to9} delta a_t\n\ny5=2, y10=6, so sum of delta y from t=5 to9 should be +4.\n\nEach delta y is +1, -1, or 0.\n\nTo minimize time, we want to go up, but with constraints.\n\nBut we have to avoid collisions at intermediate turns.\n\nFor example, at turn6, we cannot be on y=2,3,4,5.\n\ny6 cannot be 2,3,4,5 because at T=6, those have collision.\n\ny6 must be 1 or 6,7,8.\n\nBut from y5=2, with one action, y6 can be 1 (if D), 2 (if S), or 3 (if U).\n\nSo possible y6: 1,2,3.\n\nBut y6=2 or 3 unsafe, so only y6=1 possible.\n\nThen y6=1.\n\nNow, at turn6, we need to choose a6.\n\ny7 = y6 + delta a6 =1 + delta\n\ny7 can be 0,1,2.\n\nBut y=0 is possible? y from 0 to9, so y=0 allowed, but no cars there, so safe, but low.\n\nWe want to go up.\n\nAt turn7, all positions safe.\n\ny7 can be 0,1,2.\n\nIf we go up, y7=2.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nTo reach y10=6, from y7=2, need to go to y10=6, so in 3 actions: a7,a8,a9, sum delta +4? y10 = y7 + delta a7 + delta a8 + delta a9\n\ny7=2, y10=6, so delta a7 + delta a8 + delta a9 = +4.\n\nBut each delta <=1, so impossible to have +4 in 3 steps. Max +3.\n\ny10 = y7 + (y8 - y7) + (y9 - y8) + (y10 - y9), better:\n\ny8 = y7 + delta a7\n\ny9 = y8 + delta a8\n\ny10 = y9 + delta a9\n\nSo y10 = y7 + delta a7 + delta a8 + delta a9\n\nIf y7=2, y10=6, then delta a7 + delta a8 + delta a9 = +4, but each delta a_t in {-1,0,1}, so max sum +3, cannot be +4. So impossible to have y10=6 if y7=2.\n\nSimilarly, if y7=1, then need +5, even worse.\n\nIf at turn6, we go to y7=2, as before.\n\nThen y7=2 at turn7.\n\ny10=6 requires y10 = y7 + sum_{t=7 to9} delta a_t = 2 + S, where S <=3, so y10 <=5, cannot be 6.\n\ny10 <= y7 +3 =5 if y7=2.\n\nSo y10 <=5, cannot be 6.\n\nEarliest to be at y=6 is turn11, with y11=6, as in the sequence.\n\ny5=2\n\ny6=1 (after a5=D)\n\ny7=2 (after a6=U)\n\ny8=3 (a7=U)\n\ny9=4 (a8=U)\n\ny10=5 (a9=U)\n\ny11=6 (a10=U)\n\nThen y11=6 at turn11.\n\nThen y12=7, y13=8, y14=9.\n\nIf from y10=5, we go directly, but y10=5, take U to y11=6, etc.\n\nNo way to jump.\n\nPerhaps we can be on y=8 or something faster, but no.\n\nAnother idea: since y=7 and y=8 have collisions only later, we can go through them early.\n\nBut to reach them, we need to pass through lower levels.\n\nFor example, at turn7, since all safe, we could be at y=8 if we came from below, but at turn6 we were at y=1, so at turn7 we can be at y=2 max.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo I think the sequence I have is minimal, with H=9.\n\nBut let's list the actions to confirm.\n\nTurn 5: action D, to go down\n\nThen turn 6: at y=1, action U, to go up to y=2\n\nTurn 7: at y=2, action U, to y=3\n\nTurn 8: at y=3, action U, to y=4\n\nTurn 9: at y=4, action U, to y=5\n\nTurn 10: at y=5, action U, to y=6\n\nTurn 11: at y=6, action U, to y=7\n\nTurn 12: at y=7, action U, to y=8\n\nTurn 13: at y=8, action U, to y=9\n\nNow, at turn 14, y=9.\n\nWe need to make sure no collisions.\n\nAt each turn:\n\nTurn 5: y=2, T=5, no collision, safe.\n\nAction a5=D, so y6=1\n\nTurn 6: y=1, T=6, freeway 1, as earlier, no collision for T>5, so safe.\n\nAction a6=U, so y7=2\n\nTurn 7: y=2, T=7, freeway 2, at T=7, span [1,12] not include 0, safe.\n\nAction a7=U, y8=3\n\nTurn 8: y=3, T=8, freeway 3, at T=8, Δ=3, span [13,24] not include 0, safe.\n\nAction a8=U, y9=4\n\nTurn 9: y=4, T=9, freeway 4, at T=9, Δ=4, span [12-144,47-144]=[-132,-97] not include 0, safe.\n\nAction a9=U, y10=5\n\nTurn 10: y=5, T=10, freeway 5, similar, span [12-180,47-180]=[-168,-133] not include 0, safe.\n\nAction a10=U, y11=6\n\nTurn 11: y=6, T=11, freeway 6, at T=11, Δ=6, span [-29+36, -18+36]=[7,18] not include 0, safe.\n\nAction a11=U, y12=7\n\nTurn 12: y=7, T=12, freeway 7, at T=12, Δ=7, first car [-55+28, -44+28]=[-27,-16] not include 0; second not, safe.\n\nAction a12=U, y13=8\n\nTurn 13: y=8, T=13, freeway 8, at T=13, Δ=8, span [-44+24, -33+24]=[-20,-9] not include 0, safe.\n\nAction a13=U, y14=9, reached.\n\nNow, is there a sequence with fewer actions?\n\nSuppose we try to reach y=9 earlier.\n\nFor example, if we could be at y=4 at turn 8 or something.\n\ny5=2\n\nAfter a5, y6 must be 1, as only safe.\n\ny6=1\n\nThen a6, y7 can be 0,1,2.\n\nIf y7=2, as before.\n\nIf at turn6, from y=1, we take U, y7=2.\n\nCannot be higher.\n\nAt turn7, y=2, take U, y8=3.\n\nCannot be higher than 3 at turn8.\n\ny8=3.\n\nThen y9=4, y10=5, y11=6, etc., same as before.\n\nAt turn9, y=4, if we could go faster, but no.\n\nPerhaps we can stay at some point to avoid future collision, but in this case, no need, since no other obstacles until later, but we pass before T=16.\n\nFor example, y=7 has collision at T=16,17,18, but we pass at T=12, safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo I think H=9 is minimal.\n\nBut let's count the actions: from turn5 to turn13, 9 actions, y14=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions: a5 to a13.\n\nIn the answer, it should be listed.\n\nBut the player position at turn t_1=5 is given, and we need actions from t_1 onwards.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we have one down and then up, but necessary.\n\nPerhaps we can go down at turn5 and then at turn6 go up directly, but same.\n\nAnother idea: at turn5, take D, y6=1.\n\nThen at turn6, take U, y7=2.\n\nBut at turn6, when we take U, we are on y=1 at turn6, taking action U, so y7=2.\n\nNo issue.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo minimal H=9.\n\nNow, the actions:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = D  (since t_1=5)\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{6} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +2: a_{7} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 +8: a_{13} = U\n\nt_1=5, so turns: 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13\n\nThat's 9 turns.\n\nActions: D, then U for the next 8 actions? From turn6 to13, that's 8 actions U, but let's see.\n\na5: D\n\na6: U\n\na7: U\n\na8: U\n\na9: U\n\na10: U\n\na11: U\n\na12: U\n\na13: U\n\nSo one D and eight U, total nine actions.\n\nIn the sequence, after a5 D, y6=1; a6 U, y7=2; a7 U, y8=3; ... a13 U, y14=9.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, to write in the answer format.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have a D at the beginning.\n\nPerhaps we can have a different path.\n\nSuppose at turn5, take D to y6=1.\n\nThen at turn6, from y=1, we take S, so y7=1.\n\nThen at turn7, take U to y8=2.\n\nThen from y8=2 at turn8, take U to y9=3, and so on, but then y9=3, later to y9, turn14 or later, worse.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo I think the sequence is optimal.\n\nThus, minimal H=9.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nThe actions are:\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut the turn numbers: since t_1=5, it should be Turn t_1: D, Turn t_1+1: U, etc.\n\nIn the format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 +1}, ..., up to Turn t_1 + 8: a_{t_1 +8}\n\nSince H=9, actions from t=0 to H-1 relative, but here it's absolute.\n\nt_1=5, so from turn5 to turn13.\n\nIn the answer, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 5: & D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: & U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: & U \\end{array} }\n\nBut to make it with t_1, but since t_1 is given, it's fine.\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so we can write with numbers.\n\nSince t_1=5, it's clear.\n\nI think this is the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 2) on turn \\(t_1 = 5\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Collisions\n- At turn \\(T = 6\\), freeways \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5\\) have collisions at \\(x = 0\\) due to car positions, making it unsafe to be on these freeways at this turn.\n- The only safe positions at \\(T = 6\\) are \\(y = 1\\) (no collision) or \\(y = 6, 7, 8\\) (no collisions at this turn), but from the starting position \\(y = 2\\) at \\(T = 5\\), the player can only move to \\(y = 1, 2,\\) or \\(3\\) in one turn.\n- Since \\(y = 2\\) and \\(y = 3\\) are unsafe at \\(T = 6\\), the only safe action at turn 5 is to move down to \\(y = 1\\) (action \\(D\\)).\n- At turn 6, \\(y = 1\\) is safe. From there, moving up to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 7 is safe, as all freeways are collision-free at \\(T = 7\\).\n- Subsequent upward moves are safe, as the player passes through freeways before or after their collision times (e.g., \\(y = 6\\) has collisions only at \\(T = 8\\) and \\(T = 9\\), but the player is on \\(y = 6\\) at \\(T = 11\\), which is safe).\n\n### Minimal Sequence\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 9, with the sequence of actions starting from turn 5:\n- Action at turn 5 (\\(a_5\\)): Move down (\\(D\\)) to reach \\(y = 1\\) at turn 6, avoiding collision at \\(T = 6\\).\n- Actions at turns 6 to 13: Move up (\\(U\\)) each turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 14.\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions:\n- Turn 5 (\\(y = 2\\)): Safe, no collision.\n- Turn 6 (\\(y = 1\\)): Safe, no collision.\n- Turn 7 (\\(y = 2\\)): Safe, no collision.\n- Turn 8 (\\(y = 3\\)): Safe, no collision.\n- Turn 9 (\\(y = 4\\)): Safe, no collision.\n- Turn 10 (\\(y = 5\\)): Safe, no collision.\n- Turn 11 (\\(y = 6\\)): Safe, no collision.\n- Turn 12 (\\(y = 7\\)): Safe, no collision.\n- Turn 13 (\\(y = 8\\)): Safe, no collision.\n- Turn 14 (\\(y = 9\\)): Goal reached, no cars on \\(y = 9\\).\n\nNo shorter sequence is possible, as the detour to \\(y = 1\\) is necessary to avoid the unavoidable collision at \\(T = 6\\) on \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5\\).\n\n### Answer\nThe minimal sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 5: & D \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 6: & U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: & U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: & U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: & U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: & U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: & U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 12: & U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 13: & U \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 6, and the player is at (0,1). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns, avoiding collisions.\n\nThe grid has freeways y=1 to y=8 (each row). The player moves vertically: U (up: y+1), D (down: y-1), S (stay: y remains). The y-coordinate is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is at freeway y_T (i.e., the row they are on at that turn) and there is a car on that freeway such that the car's span at turn T includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player).\n\nImportant: When moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, the player is considered to be on row y_T during turn T, and only moves to row y_{T+1} at the next turn. Therefore, at turn T, the player is on row y_T and checks for cars on row y_T. Then, at the next turn, the player is on row y_{T+1} and checks for cars on row y_{T+1}.\n\nWe are given the car states at turn t1=6 for each freeway (row) from 1 to 8.\n\nWe need to compute the car spans at any future turn T (>=6) for each car. The update is linear:\n\nFor a car at turn t1=6:\n- If direction is right: at turn T, the car's span is [tau + s*(T-6), h + s*(T-6)] (since originally at t1: [tau, h] becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)])\n- If direction is left: at turn T, the car's span is [h - s*(T-6), tau - s*(T-6)] (since originally at t1: [h, tau] becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)])\n\nNote: The car is on a specific freeway (row) and the collision only matters when the player is on that same row at the same turn.\n\nWe start at turn 6 at y=1.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. The minimal number of moves without any cars would be 8 moves (from y=1 to y=9: 8 steps up). But we have to avoid cars.\n\nWe are to output a sequence of actions (U, D, S) for turns starting at t1=6 until we reach y=9.\n\nWe are to minimize the number of turns H.\n\nWe can consider a BFS (breadth-first search) over states (turn, y) and check for collisions at each step. However, note that the turn number can be large because cars move and their positions change. But note that the car movements are periodic? Actually, we don't know the period, but we can compute the car positions at any turn T.\n\nBut note: the problem is that the cars are moving continuously and the grid is infinite in x. However, the collision only happens at x=0. So we are only concerned with whether at turn T, for the row we are on, there is a car whose span includes 0.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway (row) and for each turn T (starting from 6) whether the freeway is safe (no car at x=0) or not.\n\nBut note: we are only concerned from turn 6 onward until we reach y=9. Also, we can only move at most 8 steps up (so 8 moves) but we might have to wait (use S) or even go down to avoid a collision and then go up. However, going down from y=1 would take us to y=0 (which is allowed) but then we have to come back up, which might take extra moves.\n\nWe are to minimize H, the total number of turns. So we want the shortest path in terms of moves.\n\nWe can model the state as (t, y) where t is the current turn (starting at t1=6) and y is the current row (0 to 9). We want to reach y=9 at any turn.\n\nThe actions: from state (t, y), we can choose:\n- U: next state (t+1, y+1) if y<9\n- D: next state (t+1, y-1) if y>0\n- S: next state (t+1, y)\n\nBut we must avoid states (t, y) that are unsafe: meaning if at turn t, the freeway y (if y is between 1 and 8) has a car with 0 in its span. Note: at row 0 and row 9, there are no cars? The freeways are only from 1 to 8. So at row 0 and 9, there are no cars, so they are always safe.\n\nTherefore, we only check for collisions when y is between 1 and 8.\n\nWe start at (6,1). We must check at turn 6, row 1: is it safe?\n\nWe are going to compute the safety for each row and each turn.\n\nBut note: the turn numbers can become arbitrarily large? However, we are minimizing the number of turns, so we can set a bound. The minimal H is at least 8 (to go from 1 to 9). But if we have to wait, then H might be 9,10, etc. We can set a bound, say H_max = 20 (or 30) and then run BFS.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the car positions at each turn and for each row, the pattern of safety might be periodic? Since the cars move at constant speeds and the grid is infinite, the pattern of when a car is at x=0 might be periodic. But note: multiple cars per row and different speeds? So we can compute the safety for each row and each turn T.\n\nHowever, note that the speeds are given and the initial positions are integers, so the position of the car at turn T is linear in T. Therefore, the condition for 0 being in the span is a linear equation. For a given car, we can solve for T such that 0 is in the span.\n\nBut we have multiple cars per row. A row is unsafe at turn T if at least one car on that row has 0 in its span.\n\nWe can precompute for each row and for each car the set of T (>=6) for which 0 is in the car's span. Then the row is unsafe at T if any car on that row has 0 in its span at T.\n\nBut note: the cars are independent. So for each row, we can have a set of unsafe turns (or an interval of unsafe turns, but note that the cars move continuously and the condition might be periodic? Actually, it is periodic only if the speed and the length lead to periodicity? But the movement is linear. For a car moving at speed s, the time between consecutive occurrences of the car covering x=0 is related to the length of the car? Actually, the car is a segment that moves. The condition for 0 being in the car is:\n\nFor a right-moving car: at turn T, the car is [tau + s*(T-6), h + s*(T-6)].\n0 is in [A, B] (where A = tau + s*(T-6), B = h + s*(T-6)) if A <= 0 <= B.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving.\n\nBut note: the car's span is defined by head and tail. For a right-moving car, the head is the larger coordinate? Actually, the representation: \n- For right-moving: the car is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). But note: in the update, for right-moving: the car moves to the right, so the head (which was at h) moves to h + s*(T-6). But the representation says: at t1, the car is [tau, h] (so the head is h, the tail is tau, and h>tau). Then at T, it becomes [tau + s*(T-6), h + s*(T-6)].\n\nSo the condition for a right-moving car: \n   tau + s*(T-6) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-6)\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: \n   [h, tau] at t1 becomes [h - s*(T-6), tau - s*(T-6)]\nBut note: in the representation for left-moving, the head is h and tail is tau? Actually, the example: for left-moving, the update is from [h, tau] to [h - s*(T-6), tau - s*(T-6)]. And since it's left-moving, the head is the leftmost? Actually, the problem says: for left-moving, the span at t1 is [h, tau] and then at T: [h - s*(T-6), tau - s*(T-6)]. But note: if the car is moving left, then the head (front) is at h, and the tail at tau, but if it's moving left, then the head should be the leftmost? Actually, the problem does not specify which is larger. But we have the numbers.\n\nLooking at the given data:\n\nFor example, row 1: (48, 1, right, 48) -> right-moving: at T, the span is [1+48*(T-6), 48+48*(T-6)]. \nWe need 1+48*(T-6) <= 0 <= 48+48*(T-6)\n\nBut note: at T=6: [1,48] -> so 0 is not in [1,48]. Then at T=7: [1+48, 48+48] = [49,96] -> 0 not in. Actually, this car is entirely positive at T=6 and moving right, so it will never cover 0? \n\nSimilarly, row 2: two cars: (0, -11, right, 12) and (-48, -59, right, 12).\n\nFirst car: (0, -11, right, 12) -> at T=6: [ -11, 0 ] -> so at T=6, the car is from -11 to 0? Then 0 is included? Because -11<=0<=0 -> so yes, at T=6, this car has 0.\n\nBut wait: the representation: (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving, the head is 0 and tail is -11? Then the car is from tail to head: [-11, 0]. So 0 is included.\n\nSimilarly, the second car: (-48, -59, right, 12): at T=6: [-59, -48] -> 0 is not in.\n\nBut at T=6, for row 2, the first car has 0. So row 2 is unsafe at T=6.\n\nSimilarly, row 3: same as row 2? (0, -11, right, 12) and (-48, -59, right, 12) -> same as row 2: unsafe at T=6.\n\nRow 4: (-24, 11, left, 36): left-moving. At T=6: the car is [h, tau] = [-24, 11]? Then at T, it becomes [ -24 - 36*(T-6), 11 - 36*(T-6) ].\n\nAt T=6: [-24,11] -> 0 is in [-24,11]? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, row 5: same as row 4: unsafe at T=6.\n\nRow 6: (-12, -23, right, 6): right-moving: at T=6: [-23, -12] -> 0 not in.\n\nRow 7: two cars: (-40,-51,right,4) and (24,13,right,4). \nFirst car: at T=6: [-51, -40] -> 0 not in.\nSecond car: (24,13,right,4) -> at T=6: [13,24] -> 0 not in.\n\nRow 8: (-30,-41,right,3): at T=6: [-41,-30] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo at turn 6, the unsafe rows (rows that have a car at x=0) are: 1? Let's check row 1: (48,1,right,48): at T=6: [1,48] -> 0 not in. So row 1 is safe at T=6.\n\nBut row 2: unsafe (because of (0,-11,right,12) -> 0 is in [-11,0] at T=6).\nRow 3: same -> unsafe.\nRow 4: unsafe (0 in [-24,11])\nRow 5: unsafe.\n\nSo at turn 6, the player is at row 1 (which is safe) and we can choose to move.\n\nWe must plan a path from (6,1) to (T,9) for some T>=6+8=14? But we might wait or detour.\n\nWe'll do a BFS in the state space (turn, y). We start at (6,1). The goal is any state (t,9).\n\nWe'll expand states by applying U, D, S (if the next y is within [0,9]). Then we check if the next state (t+1, y_next) is safe: meaning at turn t+1, if y_next is between 1 and 8, then we must check that row y_next is safe at turn t+1 (i.e., no car on that row at turn t+1 has 0 in its span). If y_next is 0 or 9, it's always safe.\n\nWe must avoid the state (t,y) if at turn t, row y (if in [1,8]) is unsafe.\n\nWe start at (6,1): safe.\n\nWe want the minimal number of turns, so we do BFS by the number of turns (which is the same as the turn index minus 6). We stop when we reach y=9.\n\nWe need to precompute the safety for each row and for each turn from 6 up to a maximum turn. We set a maximum turn, say 30 (so we consider up to turn 36? but we start at 6 and we want at least 8 moves, so 14, but we set to 30 to be safe).\n\nLet me compute the safety for each row and for turns T from 6 to 30.\n\nWe'll create a 2D array: safe[T][y] for T in [6,30] and y in [1,8].\n\nFor each row y and each car on that row, we compute the condition for 0 being in the car's span at turn T.\n\nRow 1: only one car: (48,1,right,48) -> condition: 1+48*(T-6) <= 0 <= 48+48*(T-6)\nBut 1+48*(T-6) >= 1 (for T>=6) -> so 0 is never in this span. So row 1 is always safe (for any T).\n\nRow 2: two cars: \nCar1: (0, -11, right, 12) -> condition: -11+12*(T-6) <= 0 <= 0+12*(T-6)\n=> -11+12*(T-6) <= 0 and 0 <= 12*(T-6)\n=> 12*(T-6) >= 0 and 12*(T-6) >= 11\n=> T-6 >= ceil(11/12) = 1 -> so T>=7? But at T=6: we have -11<=0<=0 -> 0<=0 is true, and -11<=0 is true. So T=6 is unsafe.\n\nLet me solve:\nCondition: A <= 0 <= B, where A = -11+12*(T-6), B = 0+12*(T-6) = 12*(T-6)\nSo: \n  -11 + 12*(T-6) <= 0  => 12*(T-6) <= 11 => T-6 <= 11/12 < 1 -> so T-6 <= 0 (since T integer) => T=6.\n  and 0 <= 12*(T-6) => T-6>=0 => T>=6.\n\nSo for T=6: both conditions hold -> unsafe at T=6.\nFor T=7: A = -11+12=1, B=12 -> 1<=0<=12? -> 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe for this car.\n\nBut we have another car: (-48, -59, right, 12) -> condition: -59+12*(T-6) <= 0 <= -48+12*(T-6)\nSo: \n  -59+12*(T-6) <= 0  => 12*(T-6) <= 59 => T-6 <= 59/12 ≈ 4.9 -> so T<=10\n  and 0 <= -48+12*(T-6) => 12*(T-6) >=48 => T-6>=4 => T>=10.\n\nSo for T=10: \n  A = -59+12*4 = -59+48 = -11, B = -48+48=0 -> so [-11,0] -> 0 is included? Actually, 0 is the upper bound? Then yes, because the condition is A<=0<=B -> -11<=0<=0 -> true.\n\nBut wait: the car at T=10: [ -59+12*4, -48+12*4] = [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> so 0 is included.\n\nSo row2:\n  T=6: unsafe (from first car)\n  T=7: safe? because first car: [1,12] -> 0 not in; second car: [-59+12= -47, -48+12=-36] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n  T=8: first car: [-11+24=13, 0+24=24] -> 0 not in; second car: [-59+24=-35, -48+24=-24] -> safe.\n  T=9: first car: [25,36] -> safe; second car: [-59+36=-23, -48+36=-12] -> safe.\n  T=10: second car: [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n  T=11: second car: [-59+12*5=-59+60=1, -48+60=12] -> [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n  T=12: [13,24] -> safe, etc.\n\nBut we have two cars: at T=10, the second car is unsafe. So row2 is unsafe at T=6 and T=10.\n\nSimilarly, the first car only affects T=6? and the second car affects T=10? and then what? The second car: the condition holds for T>=10? Actually, the condition for the second car: \n  -59+12*(T-6) <= 0  -> T-6 <= 59/12 ≈4.9 -> T<=10 (since T integer, T=6 to T=10)\n  and 0<= -48+12*(T-6) -> T-6>=4 -> T>=10.\n\nSo only T=10 for the second car? Actually, at T=10: both conditions hold. At T=11: the first condition: -59+60=1<=0? no -> fails. So the second car only covers T=10.\n\nSo row2 unsafe at T=6 and T=10.\n\nRow3: same as row2 -> unsafe at T=6 and T=10.\n\nRow4: one car: (-24,11,left,36) -> condition: [h - s*(T-6), tau - s*(T-6)] = [-24 -36*(T-6), 11-36*(T-6)]\nWe need: -24-36*(T-6) <= 0 <= 11-36*(T-6)\n\nBut note: the car moves left, so the entire car is moving left. At T=6: [-24,11] -> 0 in. Then as T increases, the car moves left so the entire segment shifts left.\n\nCondition:\n  Left inequality: -24-36*(T-6) <= 0  => -36*(T-6) <= 24 => 36*(T-6) >= -24 -> always true for T>=6? But note: the left part becomes more negative, so it's always satisfied.\n\nRight inequality: 0 <= 11-36*(T-6) => 36*(T-6) <= 11 => T-6 <= 11/36 < 1 -> so T-6=0 -> T=6.\n\nTherefore, row4 is unsafe only at T=6.\n\nSimilarly, row5: same as row4 -> unsafe only at T=6.\n\nRow6: one car: (-12,-23,right,6) -> condition: -23+6*(T-6) <= 0 <= -12+6*(T-6)\nLeft: -23+6*(T-6) <=0 => 6*(T-6) <=23 => T-6 <= 23/6≈3.83 -> T<=9\nRight: 0<=-12+6*(T-6) => 6*(T-6)>=12 => T-6>=2 => T>=8.\n\nSo T=8: \n  A = -23+6*2 = -23+12 = -11, B = -12+12=0 -> so [-11,0] -> 0 included? yes, because -11<=0<=0 -> true.\nT=9: \n  A = -23+18=-5, B=-12+18=6 -> 0 in [-5,6] -> true.\n\nSo at T=8 and T=9, the car is at 0? Actually, at T=8: the car is from -11 to 0 -> 0 included? yes. At T=9: from -5 to 6 -> 0 included.\n\nBut wait: T=8: condition: \n  -23+6*(8-6)= -23+12=-11 <=0 -> true\n  0<=-12+12=0 -> true.\n\nT=9: \n  -23+18=-5<=0 -> true\n  0<=-12+18=6 -> true.\n\nSo row6 is unsafe at T=8 and T=9.\n\nBut are there more? \nT=10: \n  A=-23+24=1, B=-12+24=12 -> 1<=0<=12? -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\nT=7: \n  A=-23+6= -17, B=-12+6=-6 -> [-17,-6] -> 0 not in -> safe.\nT=6: safe (as initially).\n\nSo row6: unsafe at T=8,9.\n\nRow7: two cars.\nCar1: (-40,-51,right,4) -> condition: -51+4*(T-6) <=0<=-40+4*(T-6)\nLeft: -51+4*(T-6)<=0 => 4*(T-6)<=51 => T-6<=51/4=12.75 -> T<=18\nRight: 0<=-40+4*(T-6) => 4*(T-6)>=40 => T-6>=10 => T>=16.\n\nSo for T=16: \n  A=-51+4*10=-51+40=-11, B=-40+40=0 -> [-11,0] -> unsafe.\nT=17: A=-51+44=-7, B=-40+44=4 -> 0 in [-7,4] -> unsafe.\nT=18: A=-51+48=-3, B=-40+48=8 -> unsafe.\n\nCar2: (24,13,right,4) -> condition: 13+4*(T-6)<=0<=24+4*(T-6) -> \nLeft: 13+4*(T-6)<=0 => 4*(T-6)<=-13 -> impossible because T>=6 -> so this car never has 0 in its span.\n\nSo row7: unsafe at T=16,17,18.\n\nRow8: one car: (-30,-41,right,3) -> condition: -41+3*(T-6)<=0<=-30+3*(T-6)\nLeft: -41+3*(T-6)<=0 => 3*(T-6)<=41 => T-6<=41/3≈13.66 -> T<=19\nRight: 0<=-30+3*(T-6) => 3*(T-6)>=30 => T-6>=10 => T>=16.\n\nSo T=16: A=-41+30=-11, B=-30+30=0 -> [-11,0] -> unsafe.\nT=17: A=-41+33=-8, B=-30+33=3 -> unsafe.\nT=18: A=-41+36=-5, B=-30+36=6 -> unsafe.\nT=19: A=-41+39=-2, B=-30+39=9 -> unsafe.\n\nSo row8: unsafe at T=16,17,18,19.\n\nNow, we can build the safety table for T from 6 to 30 and rows 1 to 8:\n\nRow1: always safe (for T>=6).\nRow2: unsafe at T=6,10 -> safe at other T in [6,30].\nRow3: same as row2: unsafe at T=6,10.\nRow4: unsafe at T=6 -> safe at T>=7.\nRow5: same as row4: unsafe at T=6 -> safe at T>=7.\nRow6: unsafe at T=8,9 -> safe at T=6,7,10,11,... \nRow7: unsafe at T=16,17,18 -> safe otherwise.\nRow8: unsafe at T=16,17,18,19 -> safe otherwise.\n\nNow, we start at (6,1). We can choose actions: U, D, S.\n\nBut note: we are at turn 6, row 1 (safe). \n\nWe want to get to row 9. We can go up to row 2, then 3, etc. But we have to avoid the unsafe turns for each row.\n\nWe do BFS:\n\nLet states be (t, y). We start at (6,1) with path [].\n\nWe use a queue. We mark visited states by (t,y) to avoid cycles? But note: we can go down to 0 and come back, but we want minimal turns. Also, since we are minimizing turns, we can use Dijkstra (all steps cost 1) or BFS by time.\n\nWe consider the time t increases monotonically.\n\nWe'll generate states in increasing t.\n\nStart: (6,1) -> safe.\n\nFrom (6,1): we can do:\n  U: (7,2) -> at turn 7, row 2: row2 is safe at T=7? yes (only unsafe at 6,10) -> safe.\n  D: (7,0) -> row0: safe.\n  S: (7,1) -> row1: safe (always).\n\nNow, we expand these.\n\nWe want to reach (t,9) for the first time.\n\nWe'll do:\n\nLevel 0 (t=6): (6,1)\n\nLevel 1 (t=7): \n  (7,2): safe\n  (7,0): safe\n  (7,1): safe\n\nLevel 2 (t=8):\n  From (7,2): \n      U: (8,3) -> row3 at T=8: safe? row3 unsafe at T=6,10 -> safe at T=8 -> safe.\n      D: (8,1) -> safe (row1)\n      S: (8,2) -> row2 at T=8: safe? row2 unsafe at 6,10 -> safe at T=8 -> safe.\n  From (7,0):\n      U: (8,1) -> safe (row1)\n      D: (8,0) -> safe (row0) [but D from 0: y=-1 not allowed, so only U and S? But at y=0, D is not allowed? The move: y_{t+1}=y_t+Delta, and y must be in [0,9]. So from 0, D would make y=-1 -> invalid. So only U and S at y=0.\n      S: (8,0) -> safe.\n  From (7,1):\n      U: (8,2) -> safe\n      D: (8,0) -> safe\n      S: (8,1) -> safe\n\nLevel 3 (t=9):\n  We'll have states: (9,3), (9,1), (9,2), (9,0), (9,2) [duplicates?] -> but we can keep the first time we reach a state.\n\nBut note: we might have multiple ways to reach (t,y). We want the minimal t? Actually, we are doing BFS by t, so the first time we reach (t,y) is the minimal t for that state.\n\nBut we are not only interested in minimal t per state, but the entire path. However, since we are doing BFS by time, the first time we reach y=9 is the minimal H.\n\nWe'll generate until we hit y=9.\n\nWe have to avoid unsafe states: for each (t,y) we check the safety.\n\nAt t=8, row6 is unsafe? But we are not on row6 at t=8? We are on rows 1,2,3,0. So no problem.\n\nNow, let me try to see if we can go straight up:\n\nOption: from (6,1) -> U to (7,2) -> then U to (8,3) -> then U to (9,4) -> then U to (10,5) -> then U to (11,6) -> then U to (12,7) -> then U to (13,8) -> then U to (14,9). \n\nBut we must check each step:\n\nt=6: (6,1): safe.\nt=7: (7,2): safe (row2 safe at t=7).\nt=8: (8,3): safe (row3 safe at t=8).\nt=9: (9,4): row4: safe? row4 unsafe only at t=6 -> safe at t=9 -> safe.\nt=10: (10,5): row5: safe at t=10? row5 unsafe only at t=6 -> safe.\nt=11: (11,6): row6: unsafe at t=8,9 -> safe at t=11 -> safe.\nt=12: (12,7): row7: unsafe at t=16,17,18 -> safe at t=12 -> safe.\nt=13: (13,8): row8: unsafe at t=16,17,18,19 -> safe at t=13 -> safe.\nt=14: (14,9): goal.\n\nBut wait: at t=10, we are at row5? Actually, at t=9: we are at (9,4). Then we move U to (10,5). Then at t=10, we are at row5: which is safe? yes. Then at t=10, we move U to (11,6): row6 at t=11: safe? row6 unsafe at t=8,9 -> t=11 is safe.\n\nSo the sequence: \n  Turn6: U -> to (7,2)\n  Turn7: U -> to (8,3)\n  Turn8: U -> to (9,4)\n  Turn9: U -> to (10,5)\n  Turn10: U -> to (11,6)\n  Turn11: U -> to (12,7)\n  Turn12: U -> to (13,8)\n  Turn13: U -> to (14,9) -> reached at turn14.\n\nBut wait: we started at turn6, and we did 8 moves (from turn6 to turn13) so H=8? Actually, the sequence is for turns: t=6,7,...,13 -> 8 actions. And we end at turn14? Actually, the state at the end of the last action is at turn14 (because after 8 actions, we are at turn6+8=14).\n\nBut the problem: we are to output the actions for turns t1 (6) to t1+H-1. Here H=8, so turns 6 to 13.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? The minimal number of moves is 8 (because we start at 1 and need to get to 9: 8 steps up). So this is minimal.\n\nBut we must check if this path is safe: we just did.\n\nBut wait: at turn10, we are at row5? Then we move to row6 at turn11. But at turn10, we are on row5 at turn10: safe. Then we move to row6 at turn11: safe.\n\nBut what about row2 and row3 at turn10? We are not on row2 or row3 at turn10. We are at row5 at turn10.\n\nSo the path is safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 8.\n\nThe sequence: \n  Turn6: U\n  Turn7: U\n  Turn8: U\n  Turn9: U\n  Turn10: U\n  Turn11: U\n  Turn12: U\n  Turn13: U\n\nBut wait: at turn13: we are at (13,8) and then we do U to (14,9). So the last action is at turn13. So we have 8 actions: from turn6 to turn13.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}. So t=0 corresponds to turn6, t=1 to turn7, ... t=7 to turn13.\n\nSo the actions are all U.\n\nBut let me double-check if at any point we are on an unsafe row at an unsafe turn.\n\nWe are on:\nt6: row1 -> safe\nt7: row2 -> safe (because row2 unsafe at t6 and t10, not t7)\nt8: row3 -> safe (row3 unsafe at t6 and t10, not t8)\nt9: row4 -> safe (row4 unsafe only at t6)\nt10: row5 -> safe (row5 unsafe only at t6)\nt11: row6 -> safe (row6 unsafe at t8,9, so t11 safe)\nt12: row7 -> safe (row7 unsafe at t16-18, so t12 safe)\nt13: row8 -> safe (row8 unsafe at t16-19, so t13 safe)\nt14: row9 -> safe (no cars)\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut is there a problem at turn10? We are at row5 at turn10: safe. Then we move to row6 at turn11: safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\n\nBut wait, the player starts at (0,1) at turn6. After the first action (U at turn6), at turn7 the player is at (0,2). Then at turn8 at (0,3), and so on until turn14 at (0,9).\n\nSo we output 8 lines.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence of actions for t from 0 to H-1. Here H=8, so we output from turn6 to turn6+7=13.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\n}\n\nBut let me check if we can do it in fewer than 8? We start at y=1, need to get to y=9: 8 moves up are required. So no.\n\nBut what if we use S? That would increase H. So minimal is 8.\n\nBut is there a path that avoids row6 at unsafe times? But in our path we are at row6 at t11, which is safe. So no problem.\n\nBut note: we might have to wait if we encountered an unsafe time. But in this path, we didn't.\n\nTherefore, this is the minimal.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=8. And we have 8 actions.\n\nBut note: the player update: after H actions, we are at turn t1+H. And we require that at that turn we are at (0,9). In our case, after the last action at turn13, the next state is at turn14: y=9. So we are at (0,9) at turn14.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} leads to y_{t1+H-1}=9? \n\nWait: the state after the last action: \n  We start at turn t1 (6) at y1=1.\n  After action a_6, we get to y_7 = y6 + Delta.\n  ...\n  After action a_{t1+H-1} (which is at turn t1+H-1 = 6+H-1), we get to y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nSo we require that at the state at turn t1+H, we are at y=9.\n\nIn our case, after 8 actions (from turn6 to turn13), the state at turn14 is (0,9). So we have y_{14}=9.\n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t from 0 to H-1: so the actions are for turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAnd the state after the last action is at turn t1+H.\n\nSo we have H=8.\n\nBut is there a way to get to y=9 earlier? For example, at turn13? \n\nTo be at y=9 at turn t, we must have started at y=1 at turn6 and moved up 8 times, which takes 8 moves, so the earliest turn at which we can be at y=9 is turn14 (6+8). So no.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 8 moves of U.\n\nBut let me check if we can do it without going straight? For example, if we go down to 0 and then up, that would take more than 8 moves. So not minimal.\n\nOr if we wait: for example, if we had to avoid row2 at turn10, but we are not on row2 at turn10 in our path.\n\nSo the straight up path is safe and minimal.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\", so we write:\n\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\n...\n\nBut the formatting: we write each turn on a new line.\n\nOne more thing: at turn10, row2 is unsafe, but we are at row5 at that turn. So no collision.\n\nSimilarly, at turn10, row5 is safe.\n\nSo we are good.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) is 8.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,2) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars. The cars are on freeways y=1 to y=8, and I have to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at position 0 at that turn.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at each future turn relative to t_1=7. Since the cars move at constant speeds, I can compute their positions over time.\n\nThe player position updates based on actions: U for up (y increases by 1), D for down (y decreases by 1), S for stay (y same). y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nThe collision condition: at turn T, if I'm at y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn, I collide. But if I move to a different y, I'm not on that freeway until the next turn. Specifically, at turn T, I'm on y_T, and I decide to go to y_{T+1}, but during turn T, I'm still on y_T, so I only care about cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nFrom the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, collision only depends on the current freeway at the current turn.\n\nI need to plan a sequence of actions to go from y=2 to y=9, moving up or down or staying, avoiding positions where a car is at 0 at that turn for the freeway I'm on.\n\nSince I start at y=2 and need to go to y=9, I need to increase y by 7, so minimum turns would be 7 if I can go up every turn without colliding. But I might have to wait or go down sometimes to avoid cars.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their movements.\n\nCurrent turn is t_1 = 7.\n\nFor each freeway, I have cars with head, tail, direction, speed.\n\nDirection: right means moving right, so span [τ, h] and it increases, left means moving left, span [h, τ] decreases.\n\nIn the update:\n\nLeft-moving: span at t_1 is [h, τ], and at T > t_1, span is [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nRight-moving: span at t_1 is [τ, h], at T, [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nAnd collision if 0 is in the span at turn T for the freeway I'm on.\n\nAlso, the span includes both head and tail, so it's a continuous segment.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when a car is at position 0, i.e., when 0 is in the span for that freeway at some turn.\n\nSince multiple cars on same freeway, I need to consider all.\n\nLet me denote Δt = T - t_1, so at time Δt from now.\n\nFor freeway k, I need the set of Δt where there is a car with 0 in its span.\n\nThen, when I'm on freeway y at turn T, which is Δt, I need that for that y and Δt, no car has 0 in span.\n\ny is the freeway index, from 1 to 8.\n\nk is freeway number.\n\nIn the car state, freeway k has cars listed.\n\nLet me list for each freeway the cars and when they cover position 0.\n\nStart with freeway 1:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (96, 49, right, 48)\n\nDirection right, so at t_1, span [τ, h] = [49, 96]? Head and tail.\n\nIn the table: \"head h, tail τ\", so for right-moving, head is larger, tail smaller? Not necessarily.\n\nIn the span definition: for right-moving, span at t_1 is [τ, h], and it moves right, so τ and h increase.\n\nSimilarly for left.\n\nBut head and tail might not be in order; I think we need to interpret based on direction.\n\nIn the car state: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for update:\n\nIf d = right, span at t_1 is [τ, h], and at T, [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly, if d = left, span at t_1 is [h, τ], at T, [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nNow, for freeway 1: (h=96, τ=49, d=right, s=48)\n\nSo span at t_1: [τ, h] = [49, 96]\n\nAt T, [49 + 48(Δt), 96 + 48(Δt)] where Δt = T - t_1\n\n0 is in span if 49 + 48Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 96 + 48Δt? But 49 + 48Δt is positive for Δt≥0, since t_1=7, T≥7, Δt≥0, so 49+48Δt >0, and 96+48Δt>0, so 0 is never in this span because both ends are positive and increasing. 0 is less than left end, so not in [left, right] since left >0.\n\nSimilarly, for any Δt≥0, min span is 49 >0, so 0 never covered. So freeway 1 is always safe? Is that right?\n\n[49 + 48Δt, 96 + 48Δt], left end 49 +48Δt ≥49 >0, so 0 < left, not in interval. So yes, for all Δt, 0 not in span, so freeway 1 has no car at 0 ever.\n\nBut there might be multiple cars; here only one car, so freeway 1 is always safe to be on.\n\nNow freeway 2: two cars: (12, 1, right, 12) and (-36, -47, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: (h=12, τ=1, d=right, s=12)\n\nSpan at t_1: [τ, h] = [1,12]\n\nAt T: [1 + 12Δt, 12 + 12Δt]\n\n0 in span if 1 +12Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 12 +12Δt\n\nBut 1+12Δt ≥1 >0 for Δt≥0, so left end >0, 0 not in [left,right]. So never.\n\nSecond car: (h=-36, τ=-47, d=right, s=12) head -36, tail -47? That seems odd.\n\nh=-36, τ=-47, d=right.\n\nSpan at t_1: [τ, h] = [-47, -36]\n\nAt T: [-47 + 12Δt, -36 + 12Δt]\n\n0 in span if -47 +12Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -36 +12Δt\n\nSolve inequalities:\n\n-47 +12Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 12Δt ≤ 47 ⇒ Δt ≤ 47/12 ≈ 3.916, so Δt ≤ 3 since integer? Turns are discrete, I assume Δt integer, T integer.\n\nt_1=7, T ≥7, Δt ≥0 integer.\n\nSimilarly, all times integer.\n\nSo -47 +12Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 12Δt ≤ 47 ⇒ Δt ≤ 47/12 = 3 + 11/12, so since Δt integer, Δt ≤ 3\n\nAnd 0 ≤ -36 +12Δt ⇒ 36 ≤ 12Δt ⇒ Δt ≥ 36/12 = 3\n\nSo Δt ≥ 3 and Δt ≤ 3, so Δt = 3\n\nThen at Δt=3, span is [-47 +12*3, -36 +12*3] = [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11, 0]\n\n-11 ≤ 0 ≤ 0, yes, 0 is included.\n\nSo at Δt=3, which is T= t_1 +3 =10, 0 is in span for this car.\n\nNow first car never, so for freeway 2, at Δt=3, T=10, there is a car at 0.\n\nFor other Δt, no car at 0.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? \"3 | (12, 1, right, 12), (-36, -47, right, 12)\"\n\nIdentical to freeway 2. So same, at Δt=3, car at 0.\n\nNow freeway 4: (-60, -25, left, 36)\n\nd=left, so span at t_1: [h, τ] = [-60, -25]? [h, τ] for left, but h and τ, head and tail.\n\nFor left-moving, span at t_1 is [h, τ], and at T, [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt]\n\nHere h=-60, τ=-25, s=36\n\nSpan at t_1: [h, τ] = [-60, -25]? But -60 to -25, since left-moving, decreasing.\n\nAt t_1: [h, τ] = [-60, -25], so min to max? But direction left, so it will decrease.\n\nAt T: [ -60 -36Δt, -25 -36Δt ]\n\n0 in span if -60 -36Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -25 -36Δt\n\nBut left end -60 -36Δt <0, right end -25 -36Δt <0 for Δt≥0, so both negative, 0 > right end since right end negative, so 0 not in [left, right] because left and right both negative, so 0 > max, not in interval. So never. Thus freeway 4 always safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: same as freeway 4? \"5 | (-60, -25, left, 36)\" identical, so also always safe.\n\nFreeway 6: (-6, -17, right, 6)\n\nd=right, span at t_1: [τ, h] = [-17, -6]\n\nAt T: [-17 +6Δt, -6 +6Δt]\n\n0 in span if -17 +6Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -6 +6Δt\n\nFirst: -17 +6Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 6Δt ≤ 17 ⇒ Δt ≤ 17/6 ≈ 2.833, so Δt ≤ 2\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -6 +6Δt ⇒ 6Δt ≥6 ⇒ Δt ≥1\n\nSo Δt ≥1 and Δt ≤2, so Δt=1 or 2\n\nAt Δt=1: [-17+6, -6+6] = [-11, 0], so 0 in span? -11 ≤ 0 ≤ 0, yes.\n\nAt Δt=2: [-17+12, -6+12] = [-5, 6], -5 ≤ 0 ≤ 6, yes.\n\nSo at Δt=1 and 2, T=8 and 9.\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (-36, -47, right, 4), (28, 17, right, 4)\n\nFirst car: (h=-36, τ=-47, d=right, s=4)\n\nSpan at t_1: [τ, h] = [-47, -36]\n\nAt T: [-47 +4Δt, -36 +4Δt]\n\n0 in span if -47 +4Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -36 +4Δt\n\n-47 +4Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 4Δt ≤47 ⇒ Δt ≤ 47/4 = 11.75, Δt ≤11\n\n0 ≤ -36 +4Δt ⇒ 4Δt ≥36 ⇒ Δt ≥9\n\nSo Δt ≥9 and Δt ≤11, so Δt=9,10,11\n\nAt Δt=9: [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nΔt=10: [-47+40, -36+40] = [-7,4], 0 in\n\nΔt=11: [-47+44, -36+44] = [-3,8], 0 in\n\nSecond car: (h=28, τ=17, d=right, s=4)\n\nSpan at t_1: [τ, h] = [17,28]\n\nAt T: [17+4Δt, 28+4Δt]\n\n17+4Δt ≥17>0, so 0 not in, never.\n\nSo for freeway 7, only first car causes issue at Δt=9,10,11.\n\nFreeway 8: (-27, -38, right, 3)\n\nd=right, span [τ, h] = [-38, -27]\n\nAt T: [-38 +3Δt, -27 +3Δt]\n\n0 in span if -38 +3Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -27 +3Δt\n\n-38 +3Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 3Δt ≤38 ⇒ Δt ≤ 38/3 ≈12.666, Δt ≤12\n\n0 ≤ -27 +3Δt ⇒ 3Δt ≥27 ⇒ Δt ≥9\n\nSo Δt ≥9 and Δt ≤12, so Δt=9,10,11,12\n\nAt each, 0 in span.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, the unsafe turns (relative to t_1, Δt)\n\nFreeway 1: always safe\n\nFreeway 2: unsafe at Δt=3 (T=10)\n\nFreeway 3: unsafe at Δt=3 (T=10)\n\nFreeway 4: always safe\n\nFreeway 5: always safe\n\nFreeway 6: unsafe at Δt=1,2 (T=8,9)\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe at Δt=9,10,11 (T=16,17,18? t_1=7, Δt=9, T=16; Δt=10,T=17; Δt=11,T=18)\n\nT = t_1 + Δt = 7 + Δt\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at Δt=9,10,11,12 (T=16,17,18,19)\n\nPlayer starts at y=2 at turn t_1=7.\n\nI need to reach y=9, and each action changes y by -1,0,+1.\n\nMinimum steps: from y=2 to y=9, difference 7, so if I go up every turn, I can reach in 7 turns: at turn T=7, y=2; after 7 actions, at T=14, y=9? Let's see the timing.\n\nAt turn T, I am at position y_T.\n\nI start at turn T=7, y=2.\n\nAfter action a_{7}, I move to y_{8} at turn 8.\n\nGenerally: at turn t, I am at y_t, I choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, so at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}.\n\nSo, sequence:\n\nTurn 7: position y_7 = 2\n\nChoose a_7, then y_8 = y_7 + Δy_7\n\nTurn 8: position y_8\n\nChoose a_8, then y_9 = y_8 + Δy_8\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn, say turn H, so y_H =9.\n\nAnd I need minimal H such that I reach y_H=9.\n\nSince I start at turn 7, y=2, and I can move, the earliest I can be at y=9 is turn 7 + 7 = 14, if I go up every step.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on a freeway when it is unsafe at that turn.\n\nFreeways y=1 to 8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I assume, since cars only on y=1 to 8. And collision only on freeways, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nIn the player position, y=0 to 9, but cars only on y=1 to 8.\n\nSo when at y=0 or y=9, no collision possible, always safe.\n\nAt y=1 to 8, need to avoid unsafe turns.\n\nNow, unsafe times:\n\nLet me list for each y, when it is unsafe.\n\ny=1: freeway 1, always safe\n\ny=2: freeway 2, unsafe at Δt=3, T=10\n\nBut Δt is from t_1=7, so T=7+3=10\n\nSimilarly, y=3: freeway 3, unsafe at T=10\n\ny=4: freeway 4, always safe\n\ny=5: freeway 5, always safe\n\ny=6: freeway 6, unsafe at T=8 and T=9 (since Δt=1,2, T=7+1=8, 7+2=9)\n\ny=7: freeway 7, unsafe at T=16,17,18 (Δt=9,10,11)\n\ny=8: freeway 8, unsafe at T=16,17,18,19 (Δt=9,10,11,12)\n\nNow, I start at T=7, y=2.\n\ny=2 is safe at T=7, since unsafe only at T=10.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nSince y=4 and y=5 are always safe, I can stay there if needed.\n\ny=1 also always safe.\n\nBut I need to go up.\n\nThe obstacles are: at T=8 and T=9, y=6 is unsafe, so I should not be on y=6 at those turns.\n\nAt T=10, y=2 and y=3 are unsafe.\n\nLater, y=7 and y=8 unsafe from T=16 to 19, but since I want to reach quickly, I might reach before T=16, so those might not be issue if I go fast.\n\nEarliest arrival: if I go up every turn from T=7 to T=13, let's see:\n\nAt T=7, y=2\n\nAfter a_7=U, y_8=3\n\nT=8, y=3\n\na_8=U, y_9=4\n\nT=9, y=4\n\na_9=U, y_10=5\n\nT=10, y=5\n\na_10=U, y_11=6\n\nT=11, y=6\n\na_11=U, y_12=7\n\nT=12, y=7\n\na_12=U, y_13=8\n\nT=13, y=8\n\na_13=U, y_14=9\n\nT=14, y=9, done.\n\nNow, check safety:\n\nT=7: y=2, safe? y=2 unsafe only at T=10, but at T=7, safe. Yes.\n\nT=8: y=3, is y=3 unsafe? y=3 unsafe at T=10 only, so at T=8 safe.\n\nT=9: y=4, y=4 always safe, good.\n\nT=10: y=5, y=5 always safe, good.\n\nT=11: y=6, y=6 unsafe only at T=8 and T=9, not at T=11, so safe.\n\nT=12: y=7, y=7 unsafe at T=16,17,18, not at T=12, safe.\n\nT=13: y=8, unsafe at T=16-19, not T=13, safe.\n\nT=14: y=9, safe.\n\nSo in this sequence, I never on unsafe position. And I reach y=9 at T=14.\n\nBut is this minimal? H is the number of turns, from t=7 to t=14, that's 8 turns? Let's see.\n\nI start at turn t_1=7, position at turn 7.\n\nAfter H actions, I am at turn t_1 + H.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=7 to t=7+H-1, and after H actions, at turn t=7+H, I am at y=9.\n\nIn the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nSo, actions at times: t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H-1\n\nAfter these actions, at time t_1 + H, position is set, but y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThe position at turn t_1 + H -1 is 9.\n\nTurn indices: at turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} is determined.\n\nSo, y_{t_1} is given.\n\nAfter actions a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., a_{t_1 + H -1}, we have y_{t_1 + H} = y_{(t_1 + H -1) +1}\n\nBut we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThat means at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at position 9.\n\nFor example, start at t_1=7, y_7=2.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at t=7, y=2.\n\nWe need y_{7 + H -1} =9.\n\nSet T = t_1 + H -1, we need y_T =9.\n\nThe number of actions is H, from t=7 to t=7+H-1.\n\nThe turn when we reach y=9 is T = t_1 + H -1.\n\nMinimal H means minimal number of actions to achieve y_T=9 for some T.\n\nSince each action changes y by at most 1, from y=2 to y=9, need at least 7 actions, so min H=7, reaching at T=7+7-1=13? Let's see.\n\nIf H actions, from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, total H actions.\n\nAfter these, y_{t_1 + H} is set, but we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} is the position before the last action? No.\n\nAt turn t, y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo, the position y_t is at turn t.\n\nWe start at turn t_1, y_{t_1} given.\n\nAfter H actions (at times t_1 to t_1+H-1), the position at turn (t_1 + H -1) +1 = t_1 + H is set, but we care about y_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} is the position at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nTo have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor example, with H actions, we can reach as early as turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nSince we start at y=2 at t=7, if we go up every turn, after k up actions, y_{7+k} = 2 + k.\n\nSet 2 + k =9, so k=7, so at turn 7+7=14, y=9.\n\nTurn: after 0 actions, t=7, y=2\n\nAfter a_7=U, t=8, y=3\n\n...\n\nAfter a_13=U (7th action), t=14, y=9.\n\nSo at turn t=14, y=9.\n\nNow, y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{7 + H -1}\n\nSet this to 9.\n\nWhen t=14, y=9, so 7 + H -1 =14, so 6 + H =14, H=8.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =14, t_1=7, so 7 + H -1 =14, so H-1=7, H=8.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{7 + H -1} =9.\n\nAt turn 14, y=9, so 7 + H -1 =14, so 6 + H =14, H=8.\n\nBut with 7 up actions, I reach at turn 14.\n\nThe actions are from t=7 to t=13, that's 7 actions? t=7,8,9,10,11,12,13: 7 actions.\n\nAfter these 7 actions, y_{14} =9.\n\nBut y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{7 + H -1}\n\nIf H=7, t_1 + H -1 =7+7-1=13, y_13 should be 9.\n\nBut with 7 up actions, from t=7 to t=13 actions, y_14=9, y_13=8.\n\nSo to have y_13=9, I need to reach earlier.\n\nMinimal H: since I need to increase y by 7, each up action increases y by 1, so min 7 actions, but with 7 actions, I can be at y=9 at turn 14, which is y_{t_1 +7} = y_{14}.\n\nBut we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, with min y increase 7, the earliest turn is t_1 +6, if I start from y=2, after 6 actions? At t_1, y=2.\n\nAfter 1 action, t=t_1+1, y= y_{t_1} + Δy, which could be 1,2,3.\n\nTo reach y=9 quickly.\n\ny_{t} at turn t.\n\nFrom turn t_1 to turn T, number of turns elapsed is T - t_1.\n\nPosition change: y_T = y_{t_1} + sum of Δy from t=t_1 to t=T-1.\n\nTo have y_T =9, with y_{t_1}=2, so sum_{t=t_1}^{T-1} Δy_t =7.\n\nEach Δy_t is -1,0,1.\n\nMinimal T - t_1 such that sum=7.\n\nSince max Δy=1, min T - t_1 =7, so T= t_1 +7 =14.\n\nThen y_{14}=9, with actions from t=7 to t=13.\n\nBut we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSet T = t_1 + H -1, so y_T =9.\n\nThen T = t_1 + H -1.\n\nMin T is t_1 +7 =14, so H-1 =7, H=8.\n\nWith H=7, T = t_1 + H -1 =7+7-1=13, y_13 could be at most 2+7=9 if all up, but from t=7 to t=12 actions, y_13 = y_7 + sum_{t=7 to 12} Δy_t.\n\nActions at t=7 to t=12, 6 actions, determine y_8 to y_13.\n\ny_13 = y_7 + sum_{k=7}^{12} Δy_k\n\nEach Δy_k, so to have y_13=9, need sum_{k=7}^{12} Δy_k =7, but only 6 actions, max sum is 6, so y_13 ≤ 2+6=8 <9, impossible.\n\nSimilarly, with H actions, actions from t=t_1 to t=t_1 + H -1, H actions.\n\nThen y_{t_1 + H} = y_{t_1} + sum_{k=t_1}^{t_1 + H -1} Δy_k\n\nBut we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{t_1} + sum_{k=t_1}^{t_1 + H -2} Δy_k\n\nFor this to be 9, with y_{t_1}=2, need sum_{k=t_1}^{t_1 + H -2} Δy_k =7.\n\nThe number of terms in the sum is (t_1 + H -2) - t_1 +1 = H-1.\n\nIndices from k=t_1 to k= t_1 + H -2, that's (t_1 + H -2) - t_1 +1 = H-1 terms.\n\nEach Δy_k = -1,0,1, so to sum to 7, need at least 7 terms, so H-1 ≥7, H≥8.\n\nThen min H=8, with all Δy=1, then y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{7+8-1} = y_{14} =9.\n\nAnd the actions are from t=7 to t=7+7=14? t_1 to t_1 + H -1 =7 to 7+7=14? H=8, t_1 + H -1 =7+8-1=14, so actions at t=7 to t=13? Let's list:\n\nActions: a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, so for H=8, actions at t=7,8,9,10,11,12,13.\n\nAfter these, y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{14} =9.\n\nThe sequence is for turns starting from t_1.\n\nIn the sequence I thought earlier, with actions U from t=7 to t=13, y_t: t=7,y=2; t=8,y=3; ... t=14,y=9.\n\nAnd we saw that it is safe.\n\nBut with H=8 actions.\n\nCan I reach earlier? H min is 8, since H-1>=7.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} =9, min H=8, at turn 14.\n\nIf I go faster, but I can only increase by 1 per turn, so no, min turn to reach is 14.\n\nUnless I start from higher, but I start at 2.\n\nSo min H=8.\n\nIn the sequence, with all U, it works as per earlier check.\n\nBut in the unsafe times, for example, at T=10, y=2 and y=3 are unsafe, but in the sequence, at T=10, I am at y=5, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=8,9, y=6 unsafe, but I am at y=3 and y=4 at those times.\n\nT=8: y=3, safe; T=9: y=4, safe.\n\nAnd later times no issue.\n\nSo it seems fine.\n\nBut is there a problem with y=6? At T=11, I am at y=6, which is safe since unsafe only at T=8,9.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let me confirm the sequence.\n\nTurn t=7: y=2, safe, action U\n\nThen y_8=3\n\nTurn t=8: y=3, safe? y=3 unsafe at T=10 only, at T=8 safe. Action U, y_9=4\n\nt=9: y=4, safe, action U, y_10=5\n\nt=10: y=5, safe, action U, y_11=6\n\nt=11: y=6, safe (unsafe only at 8,9), action U, y_12=7\n\nt=12: y=7, safe (unsafe later), action U, y_13=8\n\nt=13: y=8, safe, action U, y_14=9\n\nThen at t=14, y=9, but we need y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{14} for H=8? t_1 + H -1 =7+8-1=14, yes.\n\nIn the action sequence, actions from t=7 to t=13, which is 7 actions? t=7,8,9,10,11,12,13: that's 7 actions, but H=8? Inconsistency.\n\nH is the number of actions.\n\nIn the sequence {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for t from 0 to H-1, so H actions.\n\nAt time t_1 + t, for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter that, position at t_1 + H -1 is 9.\n\nFor example, with H actions, we affect positions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nSpecifically, at turn t_1, position given, we choose a_{t_1}, which affects y_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nChoose a_{t_1 + H -1}, which affects y_{t_1 + H}\n\nBut the position at turn t_1 + H -1 is y_{t_1 + H -1}, which is determined by previous actions up to a_{t_1 + H -2}? Let's clarify.\n\ny_{t} is fixed at turn t.\n\nAt turn t, we choose a_t, which sets Δy_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo, for turn t, y_t is known when we choose a_t.\n\nThe sequence:\n\n- At turn t_1, y_{t_1} given, choose a_{t_1}, then y_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}\n\n- At turn t_1 +1, y_{t_1 +1} known, choose a_{t_1 +1}, then y_{t_1 +2} = y_{t_1 +1} + Δy_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\n- At turn t_1 + k, choose a_{t_1 + k}, then y_{t_1 + k +1} = ...\n\nWe need that at some point, at turn T = t_1 + H -1, y_T =9.\n\nAnd we choose actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, which are chosen at turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nThe last action a_{t_1 + H -1} is chosen at turn t_1 + H -1, and it affects y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut y_{t_1 + H -1} is the position before choosing a_{t_1 + H -1}, at that turn.\n\nTo have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, it means that at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at position 9, and we can choose an action, but since we reached 9, we might stop or something, but we need to specify the action? No, the sequence includes actions until we reach, I think.\n\nIn this case, for min H, with y_{t_1}=2, to reach y_T=9 at T= t_1 + H -1.\n\nThe number of actions chosen is H, from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nThe position y_{t_1 + H -1} depends on the actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -2.\n\nSpecifically, y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{t_1} + sum_{k=t_1}^{t_1 + H -2} Δy_k\n\nSet this equal to 9.\n\ny_{t_1} =2, so sum_{k=t_1}^{t_1 + H -2} Δy_k =7\n\nThe sum has (t_1 + H -2) - t_1 +1 = H-1 terms.\n\nEach |Δy| <=1, so to sum to 7, need H-1 >=7, so H >=8.\n\nThen min H=8, with all Δy=1 for the first 7 actions, but the sum is from k=t_1 to t_1 + H -2, which for H=8, k from 7 to 7+6=13? t_1=7, k from 7 to 7+8-2=13? t_1 + H -2 =7+8-2=13.\n\nk from 7 to 13 inclusive: 13-7+1=7 terms.\n\nsum_{k=7}^{13} Δy_k =7, so all Δy_k=1.\n\nThen y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{7+8-1} = y_{14} = y_7 + sum_{k=7}^{13} Δy_k? y_{14} = y_7 + sum_{k=7}^{13} Δy_k, but sum_{k=7}^{13} Δy_k affects y_8 to y_14.\n\ny_8 = y_7 + Δy_7\n\ny_9 = y_8 + Δy_8 = y_7 + Δy_7 + Δy_8\n\n...\n\ny_{14} = y_7 + sum_{k=7}^{13} Δy_k\n\nBut we need y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{14} for H=8.\n\ny_{14} = y_7 + sum_{k=7}^{13} Δy_k\n\nSet to 9, with y_7=2, so sum_{k=7}^{13} Δy_k =7.\n\nSince 7 terms, all must be +1.\n\nThen actions: at t=7, a_7=U, y_8=3\n\nt=8, a_8=U, y_9=4\n\n...\n\nt=13, a_13=U, y_14=9\n\nAnd at turn t=14, y=9, which is y_{t_1 + H -1} since t_1 + H -1=7+8-1=14.\n\nNow, in this sequence, as before, it is safe.\n\nBut earlier I thought y=6 at t=11 is safe, but let me list the positions:\n\nTurn 7: y=2, safe\n\nTurn 8: y=3, safe\n\nTurn 9: y=4, safe\n\nTurn 10: y=5, safe\n\nTurn 11: y=6, now y=6 unsafe at T=8 and T=9, not T=11, so safe.\n\nTurn 12: y=7, safe (unsafe only later)\n\nTurn 13: y=8, safe\n\nTurn 14: y=9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut is there a way with H=8 but different actions? Not necessary, since min H=8.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 14, we are at y=9, but the action at turn 13 is U, which moves to y=9 at turn 14.\n\nBut at turn 13, we are at y=8, and we choose U to go to 9.\n\nBut since we need to reach (0,9), and at turn 14 we are there.\n\nIn the sequence, we have to specify actions until we reach.\n\nWith this, it works.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nIn this case, all actions U from t=7 to t=13.\n\nBut let me confirm if at any point I am on unsafe position.\n\nFreeway y=6 unsafe at T=8 and T=9.\n\nAt T=8, I am on y=3\n\nT=9, y=4\n\nT=11, y=6, but T=11 not unsafe for y=6.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 unsafe at T=10, but at T=10, I am on y=5.\n\ny=3 unsafe at T=10, but at T=10, y=5.\n\nSo all fine.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier, but min turn is 14 with all up.\n\nIf I go down first, it would take more turns, so worse.\n\nOr if I stay, also worse.\n\nSo min H=8.\n\nBut H is the number of turns? In the context, \"minimal number of turns H\", but I think H is the number of actions.\n\nIn the answer, it should be fine.\n\nBut in the car states, for freeway 7 and 8, unsafe later, but since I reach before, no issue.\n\nNow, but let me see the car on freeway 6, unsafe at T=8 and 9.\n\nAt T=8, y=6 unsafe, so if I were on y=6 at T=8, I collide.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn my sequence, I am not.\n\nPerhaps I need to output the sequence.\n\nThe current turn is t_1=7, player at (0,2)\n\nActions: for turn 7 to turn 13? Actions at t=7 to t=13 for H=8.\n\nt from t_1 to t_1 + H -1 =7 to 7+7=14? 7 to 13 inclusive.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =7+8-1=14? 14 is the turn index? Turn 14.\n\nBut actions at turn t, so a_t for t=7 to t=13? t=7,8,9,10,11,12,13: that's 7 actions, but H=8, inconsistency.\n\nI think I confused.\n\nH is the number of actions, so for H=8, actions at t = t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H -1 =7,8,9,10,11,12,13? t_1 + H -1 =7+8-1=14, so actions at t=7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14? But turn 14, we are at y=9, but we choose action at turn 14, which might not be necessary, but in the sequence, we need to specify until we reach.\n\nLet's see the requirement.\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor that, with H actions, we choose a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, and y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, we are at position 9, so we can choose S or something, but since we reached, it might not matter, but we need to specify the action.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t_1 + H -1, we are at y=9, so if we choose U or D, we might go to 10 or 8, but y=10 invalid, so we must choose S or D, but to stay at 9, we should choose S.\n\nBut in this case, since we reach at turn t_1 + H -1, we can choose S at that turn.\n\nIn the min H case, with all U, we reach at turn 14, so for H=8, t_1 + H -1=7+8-1=14, y_14=9.\n\nThen at turn 14, we are at y=9, so we choose a_{14}=S, for example, to stay.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions from t=7 to t=14? Let's list.\n\nFor H=8:\n\nActions: a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1} = a_7 to a_{14}\n\nt from 0 to H-1=7, a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to 7.\n\na_{7+0} to a_{7+7} = a_7 to a_{14}\n\nThen y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{7+8-1} = y_{14} =9.\n\nNow, with actions, to have y_14=9.\n\ny_14 = y_7 + sum_{k=7}^{13} Δy_k =2 + sum =9, so sum_{k=7}^{13} Δy_k =7.\n\nk from 7 to 13 inclusive, 7 terms: t=7,8,9,10,11,12,13 actions affect y_8 to y_14.\n\nSo 7 actions, need sum of 7 Δy to be 7, so all U.\n\nThen a_7=U, a_8=U, ..., a_13=U.\n\nThen at turn 14, y_14=9.\n\nBut for the action at turn 14, a_14, we need to specify it, but in the sequence for H=8, we have a_14 as well.\n\nAt turn 14, we are at y=9, and we need to choose a_14.\n\nSince we are already at 9, we can choose S, for example.\n\nThen y_15=9, but we don't care.\n\nIn the sequence, we have to include a_14.\n\nBut the reach is at turn 14, before action a_14.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{14} is 9, and we choose a_14 after.\n\nBut in the output, we need to list the actions until a_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nFor safety, at turn 14, y=9, no car, safe, so a_14 can be S.\n\nNow, in the sequence, actions at t=7 to t=14.\n\nBut for t=7 to t=13: U each, and t=14: S.\n\nThen positions: turn 7: y=2, choose U, go to y=3 at t=8\n\nTurn 8: y=3, choose U, go to y=4 at t=9\n\n...\n\nTurn 13: y=8, choose U, go to y=9 at t=14\n\nTurn 14: y=9, choose S, stay at y=9 for t=15, etc.\n\nAnd all positions safe as before.\n\nWith H=8 actions.\n\nIf I choose a_14 as U, y_15=10, invalid, so must not, so S or D, but S is fine.\n\nBut to minimize, since we reached at turn 14, H=8 is min.\n\nIn the action sequence, for turn 14, we specify S.\n\nBut in the initial all-up without last action, we reached at turn 14 with 7 actions, but then y_{13} is not 9, it's 8.\n\nSo we need the 8th action to be at turn 14 choosing S, but when we choose S at turn 14, y_15=9, but we need y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{14} for H=8.\n\ny_{14} is at turn 14, before action a_14.\n\nIn the sequence with a_7 to a_13 all U, at turn 14 y=9, so y_{14}=9.\n\nThen at turn 14, we choose a_14, which can be S.\n\nIn the sequence for H=8, we have a_7 to a_14.\n\na_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1} = a_7 to a_{14}.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for min H, it works with a_7 to a_13: U, and a_14: S.\n\nBut we can have a_14 as anything, but S is safe.\n\nNow, back to the cars, is there any issue?\n\nAnother thing: at turn 10, y=2 and y=3 are unsafe, but I am at y=5.\n\nBut let me list the position at each turn in this sequence:\n\nTurn 7: y=2, safe\n\nTurn 8: y=3, safe\n\nTurn 9: y=4, safe\n\nTurn 10: y=5, safe\n\nTurn 11: y=6, safe (since not T=8 or 9)\n\nTurn 12: y=7, safe\n\nTurn 13: y=8, safe\n\nTurn 14: y=9, safe\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps I can have a shorter sequence by going down or something, but that would take more actions, since I need to increase by 7.\n\nFor example, if I go down to y=1 at some point, I need to come back, so more actions.\n\nSimilarly, staying also adds turns.\n\nSo min H=8.\n\nBut in the sequence, with H=8 actions, including a_14=S.\n\nBut for the output, it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps I can reach at turn 13 with H=7, but earlier we saw impossible.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{7 + H -1} =9.\n\nWith H=7, y_{7+7-1}=y_{13}=9.\n\nBut y_13 = y_7 + sum_{k=7}^{12} Δy_k =2 + sum of 6 terms (k=7 to 12), each <=1, sum <=6, so y_13 <=8 <9, impossible.\n\nSo indeed min H=8.\n\nThus the sequence is all U from turn 7 to 13, and S at turn 14.\n\nBut turn 14 action is part of the sequence.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nBut let me confirm if at any point I might be unsafe.\n\nAnother freeway: freeway 7 unsafe at T=16,17,18, but I am at y=7 at T=12, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut at turn 11, y=6, and freeway 6 is unsafe only at T=8 and 9, which are past.\n\nT=8 and 9 are before turn 11.\n\nTurn 11 is later.\n\nSimilarly, all safe.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I can start with S or something, but that delays, not better.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nNow, for the actions:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U (since t_1=7)\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{8} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 +7: a_{14} = S? t_1 + H -1 =7+7=14 for the last action index.\n\nH=8, actions from t=0 to 7 relative.\n\nSequence: for t from 0 to H-1=7\n\nAction at time t_1 + t\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 7 + 0: a_7 = U\n\nTurn 7 + 1: a_8 = U\n\nTurn 7 + 2: a_9 = U\n\nTurn 7 + 3: a_10 = U\n\nTurn 7 + 4: a_11 = U\n\nTurn 7 + 5: a_12 = U\n\nTurn 7 + 6: a_13 = U\n\nTurn 7 + 7: a_14 = S  ? t from 0 to 7, t_1 + t =7 to 14.\n\nYes.\n\nSince at turn 14 we are at y=9, and we choose S.\n\nBut in the sequence, it is included.\n\nTo avoid the extra action, but we need to reach at the turn, so it is fine.\n\nPerhaps I can have a sequence where I reach earlier with same H, but not possible.\n\nAnother idea: if I go up faster, but I can't, only 1 per turn.\n\nOr if I start by staying, but then I reach later.\n\nFor example, if at turn 7 I choose S, then y_8=2, then I need to go to 9, which takes at least 7 more actions, so reach at turn 15 or later, worse.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think the all-up sequence is optimal.\n\nNow, but in the car state, freeway 2 and 3 have cars, but only unsafe at T=10, which I avoid.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nNow, for the output.\n\nThe sequence should be:\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nBut turn 14 is part of the sequence for H=8.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me write the turn numbers.\n\nSince t_1=7, we can write relative or absolute.\n\nIn the answer format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: S\n\nBut is S necessary? At turn 14, after action, y_15=9, but we need y_14=9, which is already true before action.\n\nIn the sequence, with a_7 to a_13 all U, y_14=9, so at turn 14, y=9, so for the action at turn 14, we can choose anything, but to be safe, S is fine.\n\nIf we choose U, y_15=10, invalid, so we must not, so S or D.\n\nBut S is better to stay.\n\nIn the minimal sequence, since we reached at turn 14, and H=8 requires 8 actions, including a_14.\n\nPerhaps we can have a sequence with H=8 but reach at turn 14 with different actions, but not necessary.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n\nBut let me see if I can have y_13=9 with H=8? y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{14} for H=8.\n\nIf I want y_13=9, then t_1 + H -1 =13, so 7 + H -1 =13, H-1=6, H=7.\n\nBut with H=7, y_13= y_7 + sum_{k=7}^{11} Δy_k? y_13 = y_7 + sum_{k=7}^{12} Δy_k\n\nk from 7 to 12, 6 actions, sum <=6, y_13 <=8, cannot be 9.\n\nSo impossible to reach before turn 14.\n\nThus, min turn is 14 with H=8 actions.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nNow for the output.\n\nBut in the sequence, turn 14 action is S.\n\nPerhaps I can have at turn 13, I am at y=9, but to be at y=9 at turn 13, I need y_13=9, which requires from y_7=2, in 6 actions (t=7 to 12), impossible as sum max 6.\n\nSo must be at turn 14.\n\nThus, I think it's correct.\n\nSo the minimal sequence is all U from turn 7 to 13, and S at turn 14.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut let me make sure about the car on freeway 6.\n\nAt turn 11, y=6, is it safe?\n\nFreeway 6 unsafe at T=8 and T=9.\n\nT=8: turn 8, T=9: turn 9.\n\nTurn 11 is later, so no car at 0 at turn 11 for y=6.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nFreeway 7 unsafe starting T=16, later.\n\nSo all good.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the car movements again.\n\nFor example, freeway 6 car: at T=8, span [-17+6*1, -6+6*1] = [-11,0], so at position 0.\n\nSimilarly at T=9, [-5,6], includes 0.\n\nAt T=11, span [-17+6*4? Δt from t_1=7.\n\nT=11, Δt=11-7=4, span [-17+6*4, -6+6*4] = [-17+24, -6+24] = [7,18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is straightforward.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 7\\) is 8. The sequence of actions consists of moving up (U) for the first 7 turns to increase the y-coordinate from 2 to 9, reaching y=9 at turn 14, and then staying (S) at turn 14 to remain at y=9. This sequence avoids all collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8, as verified below:\n\n- **Turn 7 (y=2)**: Freeway 2 is unsafe only at turn 10. At turn 7, it is safe.\n- **Turn 8 (y=3)**: Freeway 3 is unsafe only at turn 10. At turn 8, it is safe.\n- **Turn 9 (y=4)**: Freeway 4 is always safe.\n- **Turn 10 (y=5)**: Freeway 5 is always safe.\n- **Turn 11 (y=6)**: Freeway 6 is unsafe only at turns 8 and 9. At turn 11, it is safe.\n- **Turn 12 (y=7)**: Freeway 7 is unsafe at turns 16, 17, and 18. At turn 12, it is safe.\n- **Turn 13 (y=8)**: Freeway 8 is unsafe at turns 16, 17, 18, and 19. At turn 13, it is safe.\n- **Turn 14 (y=9)**: y=9 is not a freeway, so it is always safe.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: S\n}",

Each turn, I can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing my y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but I have to stay within 0 to 9.\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T and there's a car on that freeway where 0 is in its span at that turn. The span changes over time based on the car's speed and direction.\n\nThe cars are given for each freeway k from 1 to 8. For example, freeway 1 has one car: head -48, tail -95, right direction, speed 48. Since it's right-moving, the span at time t is [τ + s(t - t1), h + s(t - t1)], but t1 is 8, so I need to use relative time.\n\nLet me denote the current time as t=0 for simplicity, since t1=8. So t=0 is now, and I need to find actions for t=0 to t=H-1 such that at t=H-1, y=9.\n\nSet t_rel = t - t1, so at t_rel=0, it's turn t1=8.\n\nSo for a car, at t_rel=0, span is given.\n\nThen at time t_rel = T (relative time), the span for left-moving car: [h - s*T, τ - s*T]\n\nFor right-moving: [τ + s*T, h + s*T]\n\nAnd collision if at time t_rel, I'm on freeway y, and for some car on freeway y, 0 is in the span at that time.\n\nAlso, note that when I move, at time t_rel, I decide action, which affects position at t_rel+1.\n\nLet me define the state at time t_rel.\n\nAt time t_rel, I am at position y_{t_rel}, and I take action a_{t_rel}, which determines y_{t_rel+1} = y_{t_rel} + Δy.\n\nThen, at the moment I am at y_{t_rel}, I check for collision with cars on that freeway at time t_rel.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nLet's parse this.\n\nAt turn T (which is t_rel = T), I am at y_T. I take action a_T, which moves me to y_{T+1} at the start of turn T+1.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn based on where I am at that turn.\n\nSo at turn T, I am on freeway y_T, and I check if for any car on freeway y_T, 0 is in Span(T).\n\nIf I move to a different freeway, at turn T, I am not on that new freeway yet; I move there at T+1.\n\nSo for cars on y_{T+1}, they are relevant only when I am on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe note is emphasizing that if I move away, I don't get hit by the car on the new row at the same turn.\n\nBut since I move after the collision check, I think.\n\nStandard timing: at each turn, first collision is checked based on current position, then I take action to move to next position for the next turn.\n\nIn this case, at turn T, before taking action, I am at y_T, and collision is checked for y_T at time T.\n\nThen I take action a_T, which sets y_{T+1} for turn T+1.\n\nThen at turn T+1, I am at y_{T+1}, collision check for that position at time T+1, and so on.\n\nThe note says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\", which is consistent.\n\nAlso, for the car span, if on freeway y_{T+1}, 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1), since I'm not on y_{T+1} at turn T, I don't care about Span(T) for y_{T+1}, only when I'm on it at that turn.\n\nSo back to the problem.\n\nI start at t_rel=0, y=3.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal turns: since I need to go from 3 to 9, that's 6 steps up, but I can move down or stay, so H could be more than 6 if I need to avoid cars.\n\nBut probably H is at least 6.\n\nNow, I need to simulate the car positions over time to see when it's safe to be on each row.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeway k=1 to 8.\n\nFor each, cars are given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nDirection: left or right.\n\nIn the table, for k=1: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nSince right-moving, at time t_rel, span is [τ + s*t, h + s*t] = [-95 + 48*t, -48 + 48*t]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nCollision if at time t, for freeway y, 0 is in the span of a car on that freeway.\n\n0 is the x-position where I am, since I'm always at x=0.\n\nSo for each freeway and each time, I need to check if there is a car such that 0 is between the left and right ends of the car at that time.\n\nFor left-moving car, span is [h - s t, τ - s t], and since it's moving left, if d is left, head is larger, tail smaller, I think.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\n\nBut at T=t1, it's [h, τ], so for left-moving, head h is the front, I assume, so if moving left, front is decreasing.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: [τ, h] → [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)], so at t1, it's [τ, h], so τ is left end, h is right end for right-moving.\n\nLet's clarify the notation.\n\nFor left-moving car: at time t1, span is [h, τ] with h > τ, I assume, since head and tail.\n\nIn k=4: (48,83,left,36), 48 and 83, if left-moving, head at 83? But 83 > 48, so if moving left, head is at higher x, decreasing.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, head at higher x, increasing.\n\nIn the span, for collision, we care about the interval containing x=0.\n\nFor a car, the span at time t_rel is an interval [L(t), R(t)] such that if 0 in [L(t), R(t)], collision.\n\nFor left-moving: given (h, τ, left, s), at t_rel=0, [h, τ], then at t, [h - s t, τ - s t]\n\nSince moving left, L(t) = h - s t, R(t) = τ - s t, and since h > τ for left-moving, L(t) > R(t)? No.\n\nProblem: in k=4, (48,83,left,36), at t_rel=0, [h, τ] = [48,83], but if it's moving left, and head is at 83, tail at 48, then span is from 48 to 83, but as it moves left, both decrease.\n\nAt t_rel=0, [48,83], so L=48, R=83.\n\nThen at time t, [48 - 36t, 83 - 36t]\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, at t_rel=0, [τ, h], so for k=1: (-48,-95,right,48), [τ,h] = [-95,-48], so L=-95, R=-48.\n\nAt time t, [ -95 + 48t, -48 + 48t ]\n\nNow, collision if for a freeway, at time t, for some car, 0 >= L(t) and 0 <= R(t), since L and R are the ends.\n\nIn the interval [L,R], if L <= R, then 0 in [L,R] if L <= 0 <= R.\n\nIf the car is moving, L and R change.\n\nAlso, for multiple cars on a freeway, if any has 0 in span at that time, collision.\n\nNow, I need to find for each freeway y, for each time t, whether it is occupied at x=0, i.e., if there is a car with L(t) <= 0 <= R(t).\n\nThen, when I am at y at time t, it must be that y is not occupied, i.e., no car on freeway y at time t has 0 in span.\n\nAlso, y=0 and y=9 have no cars, since cars are only on y=1 to 8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nI start at y=3, need to reach y=9.\n\nNow, let's list all freeways and their cars.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-48,-95,right,48) → at t_rel=0, [ -95, -48 ] , at t, [ -95 + 48t, -48 + 48t ]\n\n0 in this if -95 +48t <= 0 <= -48 +48t\n\nWhich is 48t <= 48 and 48t >= 95? Let's solve:\n\n-95 +48t <= 0 => 48t <= 95 => t <= 95/48 ≈ 1.979\n\n0 <= -48 +48t => 48t >= 48 => t >= 1\n\nSo for t=1,2? t integer, t>=1 and t<=1.979, so t=1 only? t=1: 48*1=48, -95+48= -47, -48+48=0, so [ -47, 0 ], 0 is included, since <= R.\n\n0 <= R(t) and 0 >= L(t), so at t=1, L= -95+48= -47, R= -48+48=0, so 0 >= -47 true, 0 <=0 true, so 0 in [ -47, 0 ].\n\nAt t=2, L= -95+96=1, R= -48+96=48, [1,48], 0 not in.\n\nAt t=0, [ -95, -48], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 1, occupied only at t=1.\n\nt_rel=1.\n\nFreeway 2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (24,13,right,12) → right-moving, at t_rel=0, [τ,h] = [13,24]? Given (head h, tail τ), for right-moving, span at t1 is [τ,h], so here h=24, τ=13, so [13,24]\n\nDirection right, so at t, [13 +12t, 24 +12t]\n\nSecond car: (-24,-35,right,12), similarly, h=-24, τ=-35, so [ -35, -24] at t=0, at t, [ -35 +12t, -24 +12t]\n\nNow, for first car: 0 in [13+12t, 24+12t] only if 13+12t <=0 and 0<=24+12t, but 13+12t <=0 implies t <= -13/12 <0, not possible since t>=0, so never occupied by first car.\n\nSecond car: 0 in [ -35+12t, -24+12t]\n\nSo -35+12t <=0 <= -24+12t\n\nLeft: -35+12t <=0 => 12t <=35 => t <= 35/12 ≈2.916\n\nRight: 0 <= -24+12t => 12t >=24 => t>=2\n\nSo t=2 and t=3? t=2: -35+24= -11, -24+24=0, [ -11, 0], 0 in it.\n\nt=3: -35+36=1, -24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nt=2 only? t=2: L= -35+24= -11, R= -24+24=0, 0 in [ -11,0]\n\nt=3: [1,12], 0 not <=1? 0 <1, not in.\n\nt=1: -35+12= -23, -24+12= -12, [ -23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nt=0: [ -35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nSo second car occupies at t=2.\n\nBut freeway 2 has two cars, first one never occupies, second at t=2.\n\nSo freeway 2 occupied at t=2.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? Cars: (24,13,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nExactly the same as freeway 2.\n\nSo occupied at t=2 only.\n\nFreeway 4: (48,83,left,36) → left-moving, at t_rel=0, [h,τ] = [48,83], so L=48, R=83? [h,τ] with h=48, τ=83, but since left-moving, head at higher x, so at t=0, [48,83], meaning from 48 to 83.\n\nAt time t, [48 - 36t, 83 - 36t]\n\n0 in this if 48-36t <=0 <=83-36t\n\nLeft: 48-36t <=0 => 36t >=48 => t >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333\n\nRight: 0 <=83-36t => 36t <=83 => t <= 83/36 ≈2.305\n\nSo t=2 only? t=2: 48-72= -24, 83-72=11, [ -24,11], 0 in it.\n\nt=1: 48-36=12, 83-36=47, [12,47], 0 not in.\n\nt=3: 48-108= -60, 83-108= -25, [ -60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSo occupied at t=2.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 4? (48,83,left,36), so same, occupied at t=2.\n\nFreeway 6: (0,-11,right,6) → right-moving, at t_rel=0, [τ,h] = [-11,0], since h=0, τ=-11.\n\nDirection right, speed 6.\n\nAt t=0, [ -11, 0 ]\n\nAt time t, [ -11 +6t, 0 +6t ] = [ -11 +6t, 6t ]\n\n0 in this if -11+6t <=0 <=6t\n\nLeft: -11+6t <=0 => 6t <=11 => t <= 11/6 ≈1.833\n\nRight: 0 <=6t always true for t>=0.\n\nSo for t such that 6t <=11 and t>=0, but 0 <=6t always, so only left inequality: t <= 11/6\n\nt integer, t=0,1\n\nt=0: [ -11, 0 ], 0 in it? L= -11, R=0, 0 <= R and 0 >= L, so yes, 0 in [ -11,0]\n\nt=1: -11+6= -5, 6*1=6, [ -5,6], 0 in it.\n\nt=2: -11+12=1, 12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo occupied at t=0 and t=1.\n\nt_rel=0 and t=1.\n\nNow, freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst: (-32,-43,right,4) → right-moving, at t_rel=0, [τ,h] = [-43,-32], so [ -43, -32 ]\n\nAt t, [ -43 +4t, -32 +4t ]\n\n0 in this if -43+4t <=0 <= -32+4t\n\nLeft: -43+4t <=0 => 4t <=43 => t <= 43/4=10.75\n\nRight: 0 <= -32+4t => 4t >=32 => t>=8\n\nSo t from 8 to 10.75, so t=8,9,10\n\nt=8: -43+32= -11, -32+32=0, [ -11,0], 0 in\n\nt=9: -43+36= -7, -32+36=4, [ -7,4], 0 in\n\nt=10: -43+40= -3, -32+40=8, [ -3,8], 0 in\n\nt=11: -43+44=1, -32+44=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSecond car: (32,21,right,4) → h=32, τ=21, so [21,32] at t=0, at t, [21+4t, 32+4t]\n\n0 in this only if 21+4t <=0, impossible since t>=0, so never occupied.\n\nSo freeway 7 occupied only by first car at t=8,9,10.\n\nBut t_rel=0 is now, t=8 relative? t_rel starts from 0.\n\nt_rel=0: current time, but for freeway 7, at t_rel=8,9,10.\n\nt_rel is relative to t1=8, so absolute time t_abs = t1 + t_rel = 8 + t_rel.\n\nBut for collision, we care about relative time t_rel.\n\nNow freeway 8: (-24,-35,right,3) → right-moving, at t_rel=0, [τ,h] = [-35,-24], so [ -35, -24 ]\n\nAt t, [ -35 +3t, -24 +3t ]\n\n0 in this if -35+3t <=0 <= -24+3t\n\nLeft: -35+3t <=0 => 3t <=35 => t <= 35/3 ≈11.666\n\nRight: 0 <= -24+3t => 3t >=24 => t>=8\n\nSo t from 8 to 11.666, so t=8,9,10,11\n\nt=8: -35+24= -11, -24+24=0, [ -11,0], 0 in\n\nt=9: -35+27= -8, -24+27=3, [ -8,3], 0 in\n\nt=10: -35+30= -5, -24+30=6, [ -5,6], 0 in\n\nt=11: -35+33= -2, -24+33=9, [ -2,9], 0 in\n\nt=12: -35+36=1, -24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo occupied at t=8,9,10,11.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, the times when it is occupied at x=0.\n\ny=1: occupied at t=1\n\ny=2: occupied at t=2\n\ny=3: let's see, freeway 3? Freeway 3 is y=3.\n\nFreeways are k=1 to 8 for y=1 to 8.\n\nSo:\n\ny=1: occupied at t_rel=1\n\ny=2: occupied at t_rel=2\n\ny=3: freeway 3, occupied at t_rel=2? Earlier for y=3, same as y=2, at t=2.\n\ny=3: cars (24,13,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12), occupied at t=2.\n\ny=4: freeway 4, (48,83,left,36), occupied at t=2\n\ny=5: same, occupied at t=2\n\ny=6: freeway 6, (0,-11,right,6), occupied at t=0 and t=1\n\ny=7: occupied at t=8,9,10\n\ny=8: occupied at t=8,9,10,11\n\nNow, I start at t_rel=0, y=3.\n\nAt t_rel=0, y=3, is it occupied? For y=3, at t=0, is there a car?\n\nFreeway 3: cars (24,13,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nAt t=0, first car [13,24], 0 not in; second car [-35,-24], 0 not in. So not occupied at t=0.\n\ny=6 occupied at t=0 and t=1.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=3 to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nThe path must avoid being on a freeway when it is occupied.\n\nSince I can move up, down, or stay, I need to find a sequence of y positions.\n\nStart at t=0, y=3.\n\nNow, at each time, I choose action to go to next y.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nMinimal H: since from 3 to 9, 6 steps, but may need to wait or detour.\n\nFirst, let's see the occupancy:\n\nTime t_rel | Occupied freeways\nt=0: y=6 occupied (from above)\n\nt=1: y=1 and y=6 occupied? y=1 at t=1, y=6 at t=1? y=6 occupied at t=0 and t=1.\n\nt=1: y=1 occupied (from y=1 at t=1), and y=6 occupied.\n\nAlso, others not occupied at t=1 except these?\n\ny=1 at t=1, y=6 at t=1.\n\ny=2 at t=2, etc.\n\nList for each t, which y are occupied.\n\nt=0: occupied y=6 (since y=6 at t=0)\n\nt=1: y=1 and y=6 (both occupied)\n\nt=2: y=2, y=3, y=4, y=5 (all occupied)\n\nt=3 to t=7: no occupations? Let's see.\n\ny=1 only at t=1, not before or after.\n\ny=2 only at t=2\n\ny=3 only at t=2\n\ny=4 only at t=2\n\ny=5 only at t=2\n\ny=6 at t=0 and t=1, not after\n\ny=7 at t=8,9,10\n\ny=8 at t=8,9,10,11\n\nSo for t=3,4,5,6,7: no freeway occupied? But y=1 to 8, at t=3, are any occupied?\n\ny=1: only t=1\n\ny=2: only t=2\n\netc., up to y=6: only t=0,1\n\ny=7: starts at t=8\n\ny=8: starts at t=8\n\nSo for t=3,4,5,6,7: all y=1 to 8 are free, no cars at x=0.\n\nThen t=8: y=7 and y=8 occupied? y=7 at t=8, y=8 at t=8, both occupied.\n\nt=9: y=7 and y=8 occupied\n\nt=10: y=7 and y=8 occupied\n\nt=11: y=8 occupied\n\nNow, I start at t=0, y=3.\n\nAt t=0, y=3 is not occupied, as we saw.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, and I can be there at some t.\n\nThe shortest way: go up as fast as possible, but need to avoid occupied times.\n\nAt t=0, I am at y=3.\n\nI can choose to go up, down, or stay.\n\nIf I go up to y=4 at t=1.\n\nBut at t=1, y=4: is it occupied? At t=1, occupied freeways are y=1 and y=6.\n\ny=4 is not occupied at t=1, since only y=1 and y=6 occupied.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay at y=3 at t=1, y=3 not occupied at t=1.\n\nBut I need to move towards 9.\n\nSince from t=3 to t=7, all rows are free, I can move freely during that time.\n\nBut at t=0,1,2, there are some occupied.\n\nNow, let's plan the path.\n\nI need to reach y=9 with minimal H, so actions from t=0 to H-1, position at t=H-1 is y=9.\n\nPosition: at time t_rel, I am at y_t.\n\nAfter H steps, at time t_rel=H, I am at y_H, but we need y_{t1+H-1} =9, so at relative time H-1, y=9.\n\nSet T = t_rel, from 0 to H-1.\n\nAt T=0, y=3\n\nAt T=H-1, y=9.\n\nAction at T determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThe sequence of positions: y_0, y_1, ..., y_{H-1}\n\nWith y_0=3, y_{H-1}=9.\n\nAt each T, for position y_T, it must not be occupied at time T.\n\nNow, minimal H, so I want to increase y as fast as possible.\n\nBut need to avoid being on occupied rows at wrong time.\n\nFirst, at T=0, y=3, not occupied.\n\nI can go to y=4 at T=1 by action U.\n\nAt T=1, if I am at y=4, not occupied (since only y=1 and y=6 occupied).\n\nThen I can go to y=5 at T=2.\n\nBut at T=2, y=5 is occupied! Because y=5 occupied at t=2.\n\nIf I am at y=5 at T=2, collision.\n\nIf I stay at y=4 at T=2, y=4 occupied at T=2, also collision.\n\nIf I go down to y=3 at T=2, but y=3 occupied at T=2.\n\nAt T=2, y=2,3,4,5 all occupied.\n\nSo I cannot be on any of them at T=2.\n\nSimilarly, I cannot be on y=1 or y=6 at T=1, but I'm not planning to be there.\n\nNow, at T=0, if I go up to y=4 at T=1, that's fine.\n\nBut then at T=1, I am at y=4.\n\nNow, I need to go to T=2.\n\nAt T=2, if I am at y=4, occupied; if I go to y=5, occupied; if I go down to y=3, occupied.\n\nAll possibilities occupied at T=2 for y=3,4,5.\n\nWhat about y=6? At T=2, y=6 not occupied, since only occupied at T=0,1.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 occupied at T=2, y=1 not occupied at T=2.\n\nAt T=2, occupied: y=2,3,4,5.\n\nSo free y: y=1,6,7,8.\n\ny=1 not occupied, y=6 not, y=7 not (since occupied from T=8), y=8 not.\n\nSo I can be at y=1,6,7,8 at T=2.\n\nBut from T=1, I am at y=4, I can go to y=3,4,5 or y=5? Actions: from y=4, I can go to y=3 (D), y=4 (S), or y=5 (U).\n\nBut all of these are occupied at T=2.\n\ny=3,4,5 all occupied at T=2.\n\nSo if I am at y=4 at T=1, I cannot go to any of the adjacent rows without being on an occupied row at T=2, or stay, but stay is y=4, occupied.\n\nThe only possibilities from y=4 are to y=3,4,5, all bad at T=2.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be at y=4 at T=1, because I will be stuck for T=2.\n\nSimilarly, if at T=0 I go down to y=2, but at T=0, y=2 not occupied, but at T=1, if I am at y=2, is it occupied? At T=1, occupied y=1 and y=6, y=2 not occupied.\n\nThen at T=2, y=2 occupied, so if I stay or go to y=1 or y=3, all may be occupied.\n\nBut let's not go down, since I need to go up.\n\nAt T=0, if I stay at y=3.\n\nAt T=1, I am at y=3.\n\nAt T=1, y=3 not occupied? At T=1, occupied y=1 and y=6, so y=3 is free.\n\nSo I can be at y=3 at T=1.\n\nThen at T=2, I need to move, but y=3 occupied, so I cannot stay; if I go to y=2 or y=4, both occupied at T=2.\n\ny=2 and y=4 occupied at T=2.\n\nSo again, stuck.\n\nTherefore, from start, I need to avoid being on rows that will be occupied at T=2.\n\nPerhaps I should go to a row that is free at T=2.\n\nAt T=2, free rows are y=1,6,7,8.\n\ny=1 is low, y=6,7,8 higher.\n\nNow, at T=0, I am at y=3.\n\nI can go down to y=2 at T=1? But at T=1, if I go to y=2, y=2 not occupied at T=1.\n\nThen at T=2, y=2 occupied, so I need to move away before T=2.\n\nAt T=1, from y=2, I can go to y=1, y=2, or y=3.\n\nAt T=2, y=1 is free, y=2 occupied, y=3 occupied.\n\nSo I can go to y=1 at T=2.\n\nSimilarly, I can go to y=6 or something.\n\nBut y=6 at T=1 is occupied, so I cannot be on y=6 at T=1.\n\nLet's list possible moves.\n\nSince from T=3 to T=7, all clear, I can aim to be at a safe row by T=2, then move up quickly to y=9 during T=3 to T=7.\n\nBut T=3 to T=7 is 5 turns, I can move from y=0 to y=9 in 9 steps, but I may be at some y at T=2.\n\nNow, at T=2, I can be at y=1,6,7,8.\n\ny=1 is low, y=6,7,8 high.\n\nI start at y=3 at T=0.\n\nI need to get to one of y=1,6,7,8 by T=2, but y=7 and y=8 are far, I can't reach in 2 steps.\n\nFrom y=3, in one step, I can go to y=2,3,4.\n\nIn two steps, from T=0 to T=2, y can be from y=1 to y=5.\n\nFor example: at T=0, y=3\n\nAfter one action, at T=1, y=2,3, or4\n\nThen after second action, at T=2, from y=2: can go to y=1,2,3\n\nFrom y=3: to y=2,3,4\n\nFrom y=4: to y=3,4,5\n\nSo at T=2, possible y: 1,2,3,4,5\n\nBut at T=2, only y=1,6,7,8 are free, but y=6,7,8 not reachable since max y=5 at T=2 from start.\n\ny=5 is possible: e.g., U then U: T=0 y=3, T=1 y=4, T=2 y=5\n\nBut y=5 occupied at T=2.\n\nSimilarly, y=4: U then S, or S then U, etc., occupied.\n\ny=3: S then S, occupied.\n\ny=2: D then S, occupied.\n\ny=1: D then D: T=0 y=3, go D to y=2 at T=1, then D to y=1 at T=2.\n\nAt T=2, y=1 is free.\n\nSimilarly, other ways to y=1.\n\nSo the only safe position at T=2 is y=1.\n\ny=6,7,8 not reachable from y=3 in 2 steps.\n\nTherefore, to avoid collision at T=2, I must be at y=1 at T=2.\n\nNow, to be at y=1 at T=2.\n\nFrom y=3 at T=0, I need to go down.\n\nAt T=0, go down to y=2 (action D), so at T=1, y=2.\n\nAt T=1, y=2 not occupied (only y=1 and y=6 occupied).\n\nThen at T=1, from y=2, go down to y=1 (action D), so at T=2, y=1.\n\nAt T=2, y=1 is free, as we said.\n\nNow, from there, I need to go up to y=9.\n\nBut y=1 is at T=2.\n\nNow, from T=3 to T=7, all rows free, so I can move up freely.\n\nAt T=2, y=1.\n\nI can go up each turn.\n\nBut y=9 must be reached at some T.\n\nNow, from y=1 to y=9, need to increase by 8, so at least 8 steps if I go up each time.\n\nBut I can go faster? No, each action U increases y by 1, so from y=1 to y=9, minimum 8 actions.\n\nActions: from T=2 to T=3, I go to y=2, then to y=3, and so on, up to y=9.\n\nAt which T I reach y=9.\n\nStart: T=2, y=1\n\nAction at T=2: go U to y=2 at T=3\n\nT=3, y=2\n\nAction U to y=3 at T=4\n\nT=4, y=3\n\nU to y=4 at T=5\n\nT=5, y=4\n\nU to y=5 at T=6\n\nT=6, y=5\n\nU to y=6 at T=7\n\nT=7, y=6\n\nU to y=7 at T=8\n\nT=8, y=7\n\nBut at T=8, y=7 is occupied! Because y=7 occupied from T=8 to T=10.\n\nAt T=8, I am at y=7, but it is occupied, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt T=7, y=6, I go U to y=7 at T=8, but at T=8, y=7 occupied.\n\nI could stay or go down, but I need to go up.\n\nFrom y=6 at T=7, I could go directly to y=7, but occupied.\n\nSince all rows free from T=3 to T=7, I can be at higher y earlier.\n\nAt T=2, y=1.\n\nInstead of going up slowly, I can go up faster, but I can only increase by 1 per turn, so from y=1 to y=9, it takes 8 steps, from T=2 to T=10 or something.\n\nT=2: y=1\n\nT=3: y=2 (after U)\n\nT=4: y=3\n\nT=5: y=4\n\nT=6: y=5\n\nT=7: y=6\n\nT=8: y=7 (but occupied)\n\nAt T=8, if I go to y=7, collision.\n\nI could go to y=8, but from y=6 at T=7, I can only go to y=5,6,7. Cannot jump to y=8 directly.\n\ny_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, with Δy = -1,0,1, so only adjacent rows.\n\nSo from y=6, I can go to y=5,6, or7.\n\nAt T=7, y=6, I need to choose action for T=8.\n\nIf I go to y=7 at T=8, occupied.\n\nIf I stay at y=6 at T=8, but y=6 is free? At T=8, is y=6 occupied?\n\ny=6 occupied only at T=0 and T=1, so at T=8, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, y=5,4,etc. all free except y=7 and y=8 occupied at T=8.\n\nAt T=8, occupied y=7 and y=8.\n\nSo y=6 is free.\n\nSo at T=7, y=6, I can stay (S) so at T=8, y=6.\n\nThen at T=8, I am at y=6, not occupied.\n\nThen I can go up later.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nAt T=8, y=6.\n\nThen action at T=8: I can go U to y=7, but y=7 occupied at T=8, cannot.\n\nGo D to y=5, but that's down.\n\nOr stay at y=6.\n\nIf I stay, at T=9, y=6.\n\nAt T=9, occupied y=7 and y=8, y=6 free.\n\nThen I can stay or move.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nThe occupation ends at T=10 for y=7, T=11 for y=8.\n\nAt T=10, y=7 occupied, y=8 occupied.\n\nT=11, y=8 occupied.\n\nT=12, no occupation except later, but I can go before.\n\nSince from T=3 to T=7 free, I should reach high y as soon as possible.\n\nFor example, at T=2, y=1, I can go up faster? But I can only increase one per turn.\n\nFrom y=1 at T=2, if I go U each time:\n\nT=3: y=2\n\nT=4: y=3\n\nT=5: y=4\n\nT=6: y=5\n\nT=7: y=6\n\nNow, at T=7, y=6.\n\nInstead of going to y=7 at T=8, I stay at y=6 at T=8 (action S).\n\nAt T=8, y=6, free.\n\nThen at T=8, from y=6, I can go U to y=7 at T=9.\n\nBut at T=9, y=7 is occupied! Occupied from T=8 to T=10.\n\nT=9: y=7 occupied.\n\nGo to y=8? From y=6, I can only go to y=7, not directly to y=8.\n\nAt T=8, action: from y=6, if I go U, to y=7 at T=9.\n\nAt T=9, y=7 occupied.\n\nIf I go D to y=5 at T=9, but y=5 free, but lower.\n\nOr stay at y=6.\n\nThen at T=9, y=6, free.\n\nThen at T=9, action to go to T=10.\n\nAt T=10, y=7 occupied, y=8 occupied.\n\nIf I go to y=7 at T=10, occupied.\n\nCannot.\n\nI need to wait until T=11 or later.\n\nAt T=11, y=8 occupied, y=7 not occupied? y=7 occupied until T=10, so at T=11, y=7 free.\n\ny=7 occupied at t=8,9,10, so at t=11, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 occupied at t=8,9,10,11, so at t=12 free.\n\nAt T=9, I am at y=6 (if I stayed).\n\nThen at T=9, I can go U to y=7 at T=10.\n\nBut at T=10, y=7 occupied, collision.\n\nGo to y=7 at T=11.\n\nBut from y=6, to y=7 at T=10 or later.\n\nAt T=9, y=6, I go U, so at T=10, y=7, but occupied.\n\nI stay at y=6 at T=9, then at T=9, go U, to y=7 at T=10, occupied.\n\nOr at T=9, go D to y=5 at T=10, but not helpful.\n\nI have to wait at y=6 until T=11 or something.\n\nAt T=7, y=6, I stayed at T=8 to y=6.\n\nThen at T=8, I can only choose to stay or go down, since going up to y=7 is bad until T=11.\n\ny=7 free at T=11.\n\nSimilarly, I can go to y=7 at T=11.\n\nThen to y=8 at T=12, but y=8 occupied at T=11, free at T=12.\n\nThen to y=9 at T=13.\n\nBut that takes many turns.\n\nSince at T=2, I am at y=1, I could go up to y=6 by T=7, but y=6 at T=7 is free.\n\nThen instead of staying, I could go to a row that is not occupied later, but all low rows are free except at T=2.\n\nAnother idea: at T=0, instead of going down to y=1, I could go up to y=4 or something, but earlier we saw that if I go to y=4 at T=1, I cannot go to safe place at T=2.\n\nUnless I go to y=6 at some point.\n\nBut at T=0, y=6 occupied, so I cannot be on y=6 at T=0.\n\nAt T=1, y=6 occupied, so cannot be on y=6 at T=1.\n\nAt T=2, y=6 free, so I can be at y=6 at T=2.\n\nBut can I reach y=6 at T=2 from y=3 at T=0?\n\nFrom y=3 at T=0, to T=1, I can go to y=2,3,4.\n\nThen to T=2, from y=2: to y=1,2,3; from y=3: to y2,3,4; from y=4: to y3,4,5.\n\nSo maximum y at T=2 is 5, cannot reach y=6 in two steps.\n\nSimilarly, y=7,8 impossible.\n\nSo only possible safe at T=2 is y=1.\n\nThen I have to be at y=1 at T=2.\n\nNow, from there, I need to go to y=9.\n\nThe problem is that from T=8 to T=11, y=7 and y=8 are occupied, so I cannot be on them during those times.\n\nSo I need to cross y=7 and y=8 before T=8 or after T=11.\n\nBefore T=8: from T=3 to T=7, I can be on y=7 and y=8.\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=7 at T=7, then at T=7, y=7 not occupied (since occupied from T=8), so I can be there.\n\nThen at T=7, I can go to y=8 at T=8, but at T=8, y=8 occupied, collision.\n\nIf at T=7, y=7, I go U to y=8 at T=8, but y=8 occupied at T=8.\n\nIf I go directly to y=9 from y=7? No, only to y=8.\n\nSo I need to be at y=8 before T=8 or after T=11.\n\nSimilarly for y=7.\n\nLet's see the times.\n\nI am at T=2, y=1.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some T.\n\nThe earliest I can be at y=9 is by going up as fast as possible.\n\nFrom y=1 at T=2, go U each turn:\n\nT=3: y=2\n\nT=4: y=3\n\nT=5: y=4\n\nT=6: y=5\n\nT=7: y=6\n\nT=8: y=7 (but occupied, cannot)\n\nSo I must not be at y=7 at T=8.\n\nI can be at y=7 at T=7, which is free.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at T=7 or T=8.\n\nAt T=7, from y=6, I can go to y=7.\n\nThen at T=7, y=7 is free.\n\nThen to go to y=8, I need to be at y=8 at some time.\n\nAt T=7, y=7, I can go U to y=8 at T=8.\n\nBut at T=8, y=8 occupied.\n\nIf I could be at y=8 at T=7, but from y=7 at T=7, I can only go to y=8 at T=8.\n\nCannot be at y=8 at T=7 from low position.\n\nAt T=7, I can be at y=7.\n\nThen to go to y=8, must be at T=8 or later.\n\nBut T=8 to T=11 occupied except at T=12.\n\nSo I can go to y=8 at T=12.\n\nThen to y=9 at T=13.\n\nBut that is late.\n\nSince y=8 is occupied from T=8 to T=11, I can be at y=8 at T=7 or T=12.\n\nT=7: if I can be at y=8 at T=7.\n\nBut from y=1 at T=2, to y=8 at T=7, that's 5 steps, from y=1 to y=8, delta 7, but in 5 steps, I can increase by 5, to y=6 at T=7, as above.\n\nCannot reach y=8 at T=7.\n\nMaximum at T=7 is y=1 + 5 = y=6, since from T=2 to T=7 is 5 steps, from y=1 to y=6.\n\ny at T=2 is 1, after 5 actions to T=7, y can be from 1-5 to 1+5, but since going up, y=6.\n\nSo at T=7, y=6.\n\nThen I can go to y=7 at T=8, but occupied, or stay at y=6 at T=8.\n\nThen at T=8, y=6, I can go to y=7 at T=9, occupied, or stay.\n\nThen at T=9, y=6, go to y=7 at T=10, occupied.\n\nOr at T=9, stay, then at T=10, go to y=7 at T=11.\n\nAt T=11, y=7 is free (since occupied until T=10), so at T=11, y=7 free.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 occupied at T=11.\n\nSo at T=10, if I am at y=6, I can go U to y=7 at T=11.\n\nAt T=11, y=7 free, so no collision.\n\nThen at T=11, y=7, I can go U to y=8 at T=12.\n\nAt T=12, y=8 is free? y=8 occupied until T=11, so at T=12, free.\n\nThen at T=12, y=8, go U to y=9 at T=13.\n\nThen at T=13, y=9, which is the goal.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, from t_rel=0 to H-1.\n\nAt T=0, start, action at T=0 to T=H-1, position at T=H-1 is y=9.\n\nIn this case, from T=0 to T=13, that's 14 turns? Let's list the times.\n\nT_rel: 0,1,2,3,...,12,13\n\nPosition at T=0: y=3\n\nWe have actions from T=0 to T=12, 13 actions, position at T=13 is y=9.\n\nT from 0 to 12 inclusive is 13 steps? Let's see the sequence.\n\nSet T=0: position y=3\n\nAction at T=0: determines y at T=1\n\n...\n\nAction at T=k: determines y at T=k+1\n\nPosition at T=m is set by actions up to T=m-1.\n\nWe need position at T=H-1 to be 9.\n\nSo for example, if H-1 = M, then y_M =9.\n\nActions from T=0 to T=M-1.\n\nM = H-1.\n\nTo have y_M=9.\n\nIn the sequence, time from T=0 to T=M.\n\nAt T=0, y=3 given.\n\nThen after action at T=0, y at T=1, and so on, after action at T=M-1, y at T=M.\n\nSo y_M =9.\n\nCollision at each T for t=0 to M, except that at T=M, if y_M=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nBut we need to avoid collision for T=0 to M-1, since at T=M, y=9 safe.\n\nIn this case, M=13, y_13=9.\n\nBut let's see if we can do better.\n\nFirst, let's confirm the path to y=1 at T=2.\n\nT=0: y=3, action D to y=2 at T=1\n\nT=1: y=2, action D to y=1 at T=2\n\nT=2: y=1, now free.\n\nThen from here, to reach high.\n\nBut to avoid the occupation later, we can go up during T=3 to T=7.\n\nAt T=2: y=1\n\nAction U to y=2 at T=3\n\nT=3: y=2, action U to y=3 at T=4\n\nT=4: y=3, U to y=4 at T=5\n\nT=5: y=4, U to y=5 at T=6\n\nT=6: y=5, U to y=6 at T=7\n\nT=7: y=6, now at T=7, y=6 free.\n\nThen at T=7, action: since y=7 at T=8 occupied, I should not go U yet.\n\nSo I can stay at y=6: action S, so at T=8, y=6\n\nT=8: y=6, free (since occupied only at T=0,1)\n\nAction at T=8: I can stay or move.\n\nIf I go U to y=7 at T=9, but T=9 y=7 occupied.\n\nSo better to stay.\n\nAction S, so at T=9, y=6\n\nT=9: y=6, action: I can go U to y=7 at T=10, but T=10 y=7 occupied.\n\nAt T=10, y=7 occupied, so I need to go later.\n\nAt T=9, I go U to y=7 at T=10, but occupied, collision.\n\nTherefore, at T=9, I should not go U.\n\nI can stay or go down.\n\nBut let's stay.\n\nAt T=9, action S, so at T=10, y=6\n\nThen at T=10, action: go U to y=7 at T=11.\n\nAt T=11, y=7 is free, since occupied until T=10.\n\nSo at T=11, y=7, no collision.\n\nThen at T=11, action U to y=8 at T=12\n\nAt T=12, y=8 is occupied? y=8 occupied until T=11, so at T=12, free.\n\nT=12: y=8, free.\n\nThen action U to y=9 at T=13\n\nT=13: y=9, goal.\n\nNow, actions: from T=0 to T=12, that's 13 actions.\n\nT=0 to T=12 inclusive is 13 steps? T=0,1,2,...,12, that's 13 actions for positions from T=1 to T=13.\n\nPosition at T=0: given.\n\nAfter action at T=0, position at T=1\n\n...\n\nAfter action at T=12, position at T=13.\n\nWe need position at T=H-1 to be 9, so T=H-1=13, so H-1=13, H=14.\n\nActions from t_rel=0 to t_rel=12, 13 actions.\n\nH is the number of turns, so H=14.\n\nBut perhaps we can reduce.\n\nNotice that at T=7, y=6, instead of staying, I could go down to lower rows, but that might not help.\n\nSince from T=3 to T=7 all free, I can reach y=6 at T=7, but I can also reach higher? No, from y=1 at T=2, to T=7, 5 steps, max y=1+5=6.\n\ny=6 at T=7.\n\nThen I have to wait at y=6 until I can go up.\n\nBut y=6 is safe to stay.\n\nThe waiting is from T=7 to T=10, I stay at y=6 for 3 turns, then go to y=7 at T=11.\n\nBut at T=11, go to y=7, then T=12 to y=8, T=13 to y=9.\n\nCan I go directly to y=9 from y=6? No.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps at the beginning, I don't go down to y=1.\n\nFor example, at T=0, I could go up to y=4 at T=1, but then at T=2, I need to be at safe row, but only y=1 is safe, and I can't reach from y=4 to y=1 in one step? From y=4 at T=1, to T=2, I can go to y=3,4,5, all occupied, or down to y=3, occupied.\n\nCannot go to y=1 directly.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nStay at T=0: y=3, then at T=1, y=3, then at T=2, must go to y=1, but from y=3, to go to y=1 at T=2, I need to go down at T=1 to y=2, then to y=1 at T=2, but at T=1, if I go from y=3 to y=2, at T=1 y=2 not occupied, then to y=1 at T=2.\n\nBut y=1 at T=2 is safe, same as before.\n\nNo better.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=0 or y=9 during the process, but y=0 and y=9 are safe, but I start from y=3, need to go to y=9.\n\nFor example, at T=0, I could go down to y=2, then to y=1, then to y=0 at T=3, but y=0 is safe, but it's low, then I have to go up more.\n\nSimilarly, not better.\n\nOr at T=2, instead of y=1, I could be at y=0 if possible.\n\nBut at T=2, from start, I can be at y=1, as above.\n\ny=0: from y=3, go D to y=2 at T=1, then D to y=1 at T=2, then D to y=0 at T=3.\n\nAt T=3, y=0, safe.\n\nThen from there, I can go up.\n\nBut from y=0 to y=9, 9 steps, and I have to go through the occupied rows later, same problem.\n\nFor example, from y=0 at T=3, go U each turn:\n\nT=4: y=1\n\nT=5: y=2\n\nT=6: y=3\n\nT=7: y=4\n\nT=8: y=5 (but at T=8, y=5 free, since only y=7,8 occupied)\n\nT=9: y=6\n\nT=10: y=7 (occupied at T=10)\n\nCollision at T=10.\n\nThen I need to wait or something.\n\nBut at T=7, y=4, I can go to higher, but max at T=7 is y=4 from y=0 in 4 steps? T=3 y=0, T=4 y=1, T=5 y=2, T=6 y=3, T=7 y=4.\n\nThen T=8 y=5, T=9 y=6, T=10 y=7 occupied.\n\nSame issue.\n\nSo the only way is to wait at some row.\n\nBack to the first plan.\n\nIn the first plan, with waiting at y=6.\n\nBut H=14 seems long.\n\nPerhaps I can be at a higher row at T=7.\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=7 at T=7.\n\nBut from y=1 at T=2, to T=7, 5 steps, max y=6.\n\nUnless I start higher, but I start at y=3, and at T=2 I am at y=1, lower.\n\nAt T=0, if I go up, I can be at y=4 at T=1, but then stuck at T=2.\n\nNot possible.\n\nAnother thought: at T=0, I am at y=3, not occupied.\n\nInstead of going down, I could stay or go up, but at T=1, I can be at y=3 or y=4, both not occupied at T=1, but then at T=2, I cannot be on y=3 or y=4.\n\nUnless I can be on y=6 at T=2, but impossible.\n\nPerhaps I can move to y=6 at T=2, but from y=3 at T=0, to T=2, I can only reach y=5 max.\n\nFor example, U U: T=0 y=3, T=1 y=4, T=2 y=5, occupied.\n\nNot safe.\n\nSo no, the only safe way at T=2 is y=1.\n\nThus, I think the sequence with waiting is necessary.\n\nBut let's list the actions and positions.\n\nt_rel | position | action to next | note\n\nT=0: y=3, action D (to y=2 at T=1)\n\nT=1: y=2, action D (to y=1 at T=2)\n\nT=2: y=1, action U (to y=2 at T=3)\n\nT=3: y=2, action U (to y=3 at T=4)\n\nT=4: y=3, action U (to y=4 at T=5)\n\nT=5: y=4, action U (to y=5 at T=6)\n\nT=6: y=5, action U (to y=6 at T=7)\n\nT=7: y=6, action S (stay, to y=6 at T=8)  // since going up to y=7 at T=8 occupied\n\nT=8: y=6, action S (stay, to y=6 at T=9)  // cannot go up yet\n\nAt T=8, if I go U, to y=7 at T=9, occupied.\n\nSimilarly, at T=9, if I go U, to y=7 at T=10, occupied.\n\nSo I stay at T=8.\n\nT=8: y=6, action S (to y=6 at T=9)\n\nT=9: y=6, action S (to y=6 at T=10)  // now at T=10, I can go to y=7 at T=11\n\nAction at T=9: I go U to y=7 at T=10? But T=10 y=7 occupied, so I should not.\n\nAt T=9, I should stay or go down, but let's stay.\n\nAction S, so at T=10, y=6.\n\nThen at T=10, action U to y=7 at T=11.\n\nAt T=11, y=7 is free.\n\nThen:\n\nT=10: y=6, action U (to y=7 at T=11)\n\nT=11: y=7, action U (to y=8 at T=12)\n\nT=12: y=8, action U (to y=9 at T=13)\n\nT=13: y=9, goal.\n\nNow, actions from T=0 to T=12: that's 13 actions.\n\nT=0: action\n\nT=1: action\n\n...\n\nT=12: action\n\nThat's 13 actions.\n\nPosition at T=13 is y=9.\n\nSince we need position at T=H-1 to be 9, so T=H-1=13, H-1=13, H=14.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have actions at t_rel=0 to 12, and position at t_rel=13.\n\nNow, the answer should be the actions for turns starting from t1=8.\n\nBut in the output, it should be actions for turn t1 to t1 + H-1.\n\nH is the number of turns, so actions from turn t1 to t1 + H-1.\n\nIn this case, H=14, so actions from turn 8 to 8+13=21.\n\nt1=8, actions for t from t1 to t1 + H -1.\n\nPosition at turn t1 + H -1 is 9.\n\nHere, at turn 8 + 13 =21, y=9.\n\nActions from turn 8 to 21, that's 14 actions.\n\nNow, but let's see if we can reduce H.\n\nNotice that at T=7, y=6, I stayed until T=10, but I could go to y=7 earlier if possible, but not.\n\nSince y=7 is free at T=11, I can go directly at T=11 from y=6.\n\nBut from T=7 to T=10, I stayed at y=6 for 3 turns.\n\nBut at T=10, I go to y=7 at T=11.\n\nThe waiting is necessary because y=7 and y=8 are occupied from T=8 to T=11 except T=11 for y=7 is free, but y=8 occupied.\n\nAnother idea: I can be at y=8 at T=7, but impossible from low start.\n\nOr at T=2, be at higher row, but impossible.\n\nPerhaps I can delay reaching y=6.\n\nFor example, at T=2, y=1, I can stay at lower rows longer, but since all rows free from T=3, better to go up to y=6 asap.\n\nThen wait.\n\nBut when I go up, I can be at y=6 at T=7, which is fine.\n\nThen instead of staying at y=6, I could go down to y=5 or something, but that might not help and could increase time.\n\nFor example, at T=7, y=6, I go down to y=5 at T=8.\n\nAt T=8, y=5 free.\n\nThen I can stay or go up, but to go up, I need to go through y=6 and y=7 later.\n\nAt T=8, y=5, I can go U to y=6 at T=9, etc., but similar to before, I can reach y=7 at T=11.\n\nBut from y=5, it takes more steps to go up.\n\nFor example, from y=5 at T=8, to y=6 at T=9, y=7 at T=10 (occupied? T=10 y=7 occupied), so go to y=7 at T=11, same as before.\n\nBut I have lower y, so it takes longer to reach y=9.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo best to be at high y when possible.\n\nThus, the sequence with being at y=6 from T=7 to T=10, then to y=7 at T=11, y=8 at T=12, y=9 at T=13.\n\nIn the action sequence, from T=7 to T=9, I stayed at y=6.\n\nT=7: action S to stay at T=8\n\nT=8: action S to stay at T=9\n\nT=9: action S to stay at T=10? In my earlier, at T=9 I stayed to T=10.\n\nThen at T=10, I went U to y=7 at T=11.\n\nBut at T=10, I am at y=6, and I go U to y=7 at T=11.\n\nI could at T=10 go directly, but no.\n\nNow, to save one turn, notice that at T=11, I go to y=7, then to y=8 at T=12, to y=9 at T=13.\n\nBut at T=12, y=8, I go to y=9 at T=13.\n\nBut y=9 is safe, but I reach at T=13.\n\nSince y=8 is occupied until T=11, free at T=12.\n\nI can be at y=8 at T=12, then y=9 at T=13.\n\nBut I need to be at y=7 to go to y=8.\n\ny=7 free at T=11, so I can be at y=7 at T=11, then y=8 at T=12.\n\nNo way to jump.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=9 at T=12.\n\nFor that, I need to be at y=8 at T=11, but at T=11, y=8 occupied, cannot.\n\nOr at T=12, be at y=8, then to y=9 at T=13.\n\nCannot reach y=9 before T=13 from this path.\n\nAnother path: suppose at the beginning, I go to y=4 at T=1, but then at T=2, I need to be at safe row, only y=1, but from y=4, I can go to y=3 or y=2 or y=5 at T=2, all occupied, and I can't go to y=1 directly.\n\nNot possible.\n\nOr, at T=0, I go down to y=2, then at T=1, instead of down to y=1, I could go to y=3, but at T=1, y=3 not occupied, then at T=2, y=3 occupied, must move, but y=2,4 occupied, y=1 free, so I can go to y=1 at T=2 from y=3? From y=3 at T=1, I can go D to y=2 at T=2, occupied; U to y=4, occupied; S to y=3, occupied. No way to y=1 at T=2 from y=3.\n\nOnly from y=2 at T=1, I can go D to y=1 at T=2.\n\nSo no other choices.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 14.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nt_rel | turn absolute | action | position next\n\nt1=8, t_rel=0: position y=3, action D (so to y=2 at t=9)\n\nAbsolute turn: current turn t1=8, position at turn 8 is (0,3)\n\nThen action at turn 8: determines position at turn 9.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSet:\n\nAt turn 8 (t_rel=0): position y=3, take action a_{8}\n\nAfter action, position at turn 9.\n\nIn the sequence, for each turn, we output the action.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t: a_t\n\nWhere a_t is for that turn.\n\nPosition at turn t is before action? Or after?\n\nTypically, at turn t, player is at position, then takes action to move to next position.\n\nIn the game dynamics: at turn t, position (0, y_t), take action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nThen at turn t+1, position (0, y_{t+1}), and so on.\n\nCollision at turn t based on y_t.\n\nIn this case, at turn t, we have y_t, then take a_t, go to y_{t+1}.\n\nWe need at some turn T, y_T =9.\n\nWith T = t1 + H -1.\n\nH min.\n\nIn our case, with actions from turn 8 to turn 20? Let's list.\n\nStart: turn 8, y=3\n\nAction at turn 8: D, so y at turn 9: 2\n\nTurn 9, y=2, action D, so y at turn 10: 1\n\nTurn 10, y=1, action U, so y at turn 11: 2\n\nTurn 11, y=2, action U, so y at turn 12: 3\n\nTurn 12, y=3, action U, so y at turn 13: 4\n\nTurn 13, y=4, action U, so y at turn 14: 5\n\nTurn 14, y=5, action U, so y at turn 15: 6\n\nTurn 15, y=6, action S (stay), so y at turn 16: 6\n\nTurn 16, y=6, action S, so y at turn 17: 6\n\nTurn 17, y=6, action S? Turn 17 is t_rel=9? Let's use absolute.\n\nt_abs from 8 to ...\n\nAt turn 15: y=6, action S, so y turn 16:6\n\nTurn 16: y=6, action S, so y turn 17:6\n\nNow, at turn 17, y=6, I need to go up later.\n\nFrom earlier plan, at t_rel=10, which is turn 18? t1=8, t_rel=0 turn8, t_rel=1 turn9, ..., t_rel=10 turn18.\n\nAt t_rel=10, position y=6 (if I stay), then action U to y=7 at t_rel=11, turn19.\n\nBut at turn 19, y=7, which is t_rel=11.\n\nt_rel=11 is turn 19? turn8 +11=19, yes.\n\nAt turn 19, y=7, should be free? t_rel=11, y=7 free.\n\nThen action U to y=8 at turn 20.\n\nTurn 20, y=8, t_rel=12, free? y=8 at t_rel=12, free.\n\nThen action U to y=9 at turn 21.\n\nTurn 21, y=9.\n\nNow, actions from turn 8 to turn 20.\n\nTurn 8: action\n\nTurn 9: action\n\n...\n\nTurn 20: action for turn 21.\n\nNumber of actions: from turn 8 to 20 inclusive, that's 13 actions? 20-8+1=13 actions.\n\nThen position at turn 21 is y=9.\n\nSince turn 21 = t1 + H -1, t1=8, so 8 + H -1 =21, thus 7 + H =21, H=14.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 17, I have y=6, but in the actions, I need to output until the action that brings me to y=9.\n\nIn the waiting, I stayed at y=6 from turn 15 to turn 17.\n\nturn 15: y=6, action S (for turn 16)\n\nturn 16: y=6, action S (for turn 17)\n\nturn 17: y=6, action ? Now at turn 17, I should take action to go to y=7 at turn 18.\n\nBut at turn 18, y=7 is t_rel=10, which is occupied? t_rel=10, y=7 occupied from t=8 to10, t_rel=10 is t=18? t1=8, t_rel=10 is turn 18.\n\ny=7 occupied at t_rel=8,9,10, so turn 18 (t_rel=10) occupied.\n\nIf I go U at turn 17, to y=7 at turn 18, occupied, collision.\n\nTherefore, at turn 17, I cannot go U.\n\nI should stay or go down.\n\nBut better to stay.\n\nAction S, so y at turn 18:6\n\nThen at turn 18, y=6, action U to y=7 at turn 19.\n\nTurn 19, t_rel=11, y=7 free.\n\nThen action U to y=8 at turn 20.\n\nTurn 20, y=8, t_rel=12, free.\n\nAction U to y=9 at turn 21.\n\nTurn 21, y=9.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 17: action S (stay, y=6 at turn 18)\n\nTurn 18: action U (to y=7 at turn 19)\n\netc.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 8: D\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U  // y at turn 15:6\n\nTurn 15: S  // stay, y at turn 16:6\n\nTurn 16: S  // stay, y at turn 17:6\n\nTurn 17: S  // stay, y at turn 18:6\n\nNow turn 18: y=6, action U, to y=7 at turn 19\n\nTurn 19: y=7, action U, to y=8 at turn 20\n\nTurn 20: y=8, action U, to y=9 at turn 21\n\nSo actions up to turn 20.\n\nThat is, actions for turn 8 to turn 20.\n\nNumber of actions: 20-8+1=13 actions.\n\nH=14, since position at turn 21=8+13=21, t1+H-1=8+H-1=21, so H-1=13, H=14.\n\nNow, in the output, we need to list the actions from turn t1 to t1+H-1, which is turn 8 to 21? t1+H-1=8+13=21, but actions at turn t determine position at turn t+1.\n\nIn the answer, it says: Turn t: a_t for t from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nIn this case, a_t for t=8 to 20, since at turn 20, action to go to y=9 at turn 21.\n\nAnd turn 21 is when we reach, but no action at turn 21 needed.\n\nSo actions from turn 8 to turn 20.\n\nThat's 13 actions, but H=14 turns? H is the number of turns including the start, I think.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H, meaning the number of game turns from start to end.\n\nPosition at turn t1 is given, then after H turns, position at turn t1 + H -1 is 9? Let's see the problem.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nSo actions for t from 0 to H-1 relative, so for absolute turns t1 to t1 + H -1.\n\nAnd position at turn t1 + H -1 is (0,9).\n\nIn this case, t1 + H -1 = 21, t1=8, so 8 + H -1 =21, H-1=13, H=14.\n\nActions for turns 8 to 21? t1 to t1+H-1 =8 to 8+13=21.\n\nt1 + H -1 =21.\n\nBut at turn 21, we take action? No, the actions are from t1 to t1+H-1, but at turn t1+H-1, we take action to go to the position at next turn, but we need position at turn t1+H-1 to be 9, so at turn t1+H-1, before action, position is 9, then we don't need to take action? But the sequence includes actions up to when we reach.\n\nI think I confused.\n\nStandard: at turn T, position y_T, take action a_T, go to y_{T+1}.\n\nWe need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThat means at turn t1 + H -1, position is 9.\n\nThen, the actions taken are from turn t1 to turn t1 + H -2, to reach position at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, start turn t1, position given, take action a_{t1} to go to position at turn t1+1.\n\nThen take a_{t1+1} to go to turn t1+2, ..., take a_{t1 + H -2} to go to position at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nSo actions from turn t1 to t1 + H -2, H-1 actions.\n\nPosition at turn t1 + H -1 is 9.\n\nIn our case, position at turn 21 is 9.\n\nThen actions from turn 8 to turn 20, that's turn 8 to 20, which is 13 actions? 20-8+1=13, but number of actions is H-1.\n\nSince position at turn t1 + H -1 =21, and t1=8, so 8 + H -1 =21, thus H-1=13, so 13 actions.\n\nH=14.\n\nIn the sequence, actions for turn 8 to turn 20.\n\nNow, in the output, list:\n\nTurn 8: D\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U  // after this, position turn 15:6\n\nTurn 15: S  // to position turn 16:6\n\nTurn 16: S  // to turn 17:6\n\nTurn 17: S  // to turn 18:6\n\nTurn 18: U  // to turn 19:7\n\nTurn 19: U  // to turn 20:8\n\nTurn 20: U  // to turn 21:9\n\nYes.\n\nBut at turn 18, action U to turn 19 y=7, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, is there a shorter path?\n\nSuppose at turn 15, y=6, instead of staying, I go down to y=5 at turn 16.\n\nThen at turn 16, y=5, I can go to y=6 at turn 17, etc., but it might take more turns to go up later.\n\nFor example, from y=5 at turn 16, to y=6 at turn 17, y=7 at turn 18 (occupied), so I need to wait until turn 19 to go to y=7, but at turn 19, I can go to y=7, same as before but I am at lower position, so to reach y=9 later.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 14.\n\nBut in the sequence, I stayed at y=6 for turns 15,16,17 actions S, but at turn 17 action S to turn 18 y=6, then U to turn 19 y=7.\n\nI could have gone to y=7 directly at turn 19 from turn 18, but I need to be at y=6 at turn 18.\n\nSince I have to wait, it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I can save one turn by not staying so long, but I have to avoid the occupied times.\n\nFor example, if at turn 15, y=6, I go U to y=7 at turn 16, but turn 16 is t_rel=8, y=7 occupied, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo I think H=14 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 8: D\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: S\n\nTurn 17: S\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nIn the sequence, turn 14: U to position turn 15:6\n\nThen turn 15: S to turn 16:6\n\nTurn 16: S to turn 17:6\n\nTurn 17: S to turn 18:6\n\nTurn 18: U to turn 19:7\n\nTurn 19: U to turn 20:8\n\nTurn 20: U to turn 21:9\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in the box.\n\nBut the car state had freeway 3 same as 2, etc., but I think we covered.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier if I go faster at the beginning, but I don't think so.\n\nAnother point: at turn 10, y=1, I went up, but I could go up faster, but only one per turn.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think this is the minimal.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 8\\) is 14. The sequence of actions from turn 8 to turn 20 (inclusive) ensures the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 21 while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\).\n\nThe actions are determined as follows:\n- At turn 8, the player is at \\(y = 3\\). Moving down (D) avoids immediate issues and positions for future moves.\n- Turns 9 to 10: Continue moving down to reach \\(y = 1\\) by turn 10, avoiding occupations at \\(y = 6\\) (occupied at turns 8 and 9) and positioning to avoid \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5\\) at turn 10 (all occupied).\n- Turns 11 to 14: Move up consistently to reach \\(y = 6\\) by turn 15, taking advantage of free rows from turns 11 to 14.\n- Turns 15 to 17: Stay (S) at \\(y = 6\\) to avoid moving into \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\), which are occupied from turns 16 to 19.\n- Turns 18 to 20: Move up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 19, \\(y = 8\\) at turn 20, and \\(y = 9\\) at turn 21. This timing avoids occupations at \\(y = 7\\) (occupied until turn 18) and \\(y = 8\\) (occupied until turn 19).\n\nThe action sequence is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: D \\\\\nTurn 9: D \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: S \\\\\nTurn 16: S \\\\\nTurn 17: S \\\\\nTurn 18: U \\\\\nTurn 19: U \\\\\nTurn 20: U\n}",

The current turn is t_1 = 9, and I start at y=2.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements. Cars move left or right at their speeds, and I need to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at position x=0 at that turn.\n\nThe collision condition is that at turn T, if I'm on freeway y_T, and for any car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at time T. The span changes linearly with time.\n\nAlso, when I move, I'm only on the new freeway starting from the next turn. So if I move at turn T, at turn T I'm still on the old freeway, and at turn T+1 I'm on the new one.\n\nThe player position update is: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on action U, D, S.\n\nActions: U for up (y increases by 1), D for down (y decreases by 1), S for stay (y same).\n\ny must stay between 0 and 9, inclusive.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nCurrent position: y=2 at turn t=9.\n\nCars are given for each freeway from 1 to 8.\n\nLet me list the cars for each freeway at turn t=9.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (h, τ, d, s) = (0, -47, right, 48)\n\nSince it's right-moving, span at time t is [τ + s(t - t_1), h + s(t - t_1)]? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFor right-moving: at time T, span is [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]? But in the table, for freeway 2, it has (36,25,right,12), which should be head and tail.\n\nI think for right-moving, head is the front, so if moving right, head is larger, tail smaller? But in the span, it says for right-moving: [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the input, for freeway 2, it has (36,25,right,12), and 36 > 25, so head=36, tail=25? But if moving right, head should be on the right, so if tail=25, head=36, then at t1, span is [25,36]? But the notation says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, span is [τ, h] at t1? Let's read carefully.\n\n\"Car update rules: For car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail is at τ at turn t1\"\n\nThen for left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nFor right-moving: span(t1) = [τ, h] → span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn left-moving, head is h, tail is τ, and since moving left, head is on the left, so span [h, τ] with h > τ probably, decreasing.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, span [τ, h] with τ < h, increasing.\n\nIn the input, for freeway 1: (0, -47, right, 48)\n\nSince right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-47, 0]\n\nDirection right, so at time T, span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-47 + 48(T-9), 0 + 48(T-9)] = [48(T-9) - 47, 48(T-9)]\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: two cars: first (36,25,right,12), second (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nFirst car: right-moving, span at t1: [τ, h] = [25,36]? But it says head h, tail τ, so for right-moving, span is [τ, h], so [25,36] at t1.\n\nAt time T, span(T) = [25 + 12(T-9), 36 + 12(T-9)]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (-12,-23,right,12), head h=-12, tail τ=-23, so span at t1: [τ, h] = [-23, -12]\n\nAt T: [-23 + 12(T-9), -12 + 12(T-9)]\n\nNow freeway 3 has the same as freeway 2? \"3 | (36, 25, right, 12), (-12, -23, right, 12)\" same as freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: (12,47,left,36)\n\nLeft-moving, so head h=12, tail τ=47? But if left-moving, head should be on left, tail on right? Let's see.\n\nFor left-moving, span at t1: [h, τ] = [12,47], so h=12, τ=47, but if moving left, head at 12, tail at 47, that would mean head left of tail, so car extending from 12 to 47, moving left, so head decreasing.\n\nAt time T, span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] = [12 - 36(T-9), 47 - 36(T-9)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5 same as 4: (12,47,left,36)\n\nFreeway 6: (6,-5,right,6) — head h=6, tail τ=-5, right-moving, span at t1: [τ, h] = [-5,6]\n\nAt T: [-5 + 6(T-9), 6 + 6(T-9)]\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (-28,-39,right,4) and (36,25,right,4)\n\nFirst: head h=-28, tail τ=-39, right-moving, span [τ,h] = [-39,-28] at t1\n\nAt T: [-39 + 4(T-9), -28 + 4(T-9)]\n\nSecond: (36,25,right,4), span [25,36] at t1, at T: [25 + 4(T-9), 36 + 4(T-9)]\n\nFreeway 8: (-21,-32,right,3), head h=-21, tail τ=-32, right-moving, span [τ,h] = [-32,-21] at t1\n\nAt T: [-32 + 3(T-9), -21 + 3(T-9)]\n\nNow, I need to find when each freeway has a car at position 0 for a given turn T.\n\nThat is, for each freeway, at turn T, if there is a car such that 0 is in its span at time T.\n\nSince I might be on freeway y at turn T, I need to check for each y from 1 to 8, whether at time T, for that freeway, 0 is in some car's span.\n\nThen I must avoid being on that freeway when it is occupied at x=0.\n\nAlso, at y=0 and y=9, no cars, so safe, but I start from y=2 and need to reach y=9, so I have to go through y=1 to 8 or jump, but I can only change by ±1 or 0 per turn.\n\ny=0 is safe, y=9 is safe, but I need to be at (0,9), so when I reach y=9, I'm done.\n\nThe game ends when I reach (0,9), at that turn, I don't care about cars, I think, since collision is checked when I'm on a freeway, but y=9 has no freeway, I think freeways are y=1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\nThe vertical axis y=0,1,...,9, freeways on y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are sidewalks or something, no cars.\n\nSo when I'm at y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nBut I start at y=2, which is freeway 2? y=2 is freeway, since freeways y=1 to 8.\n\ny=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 are freeways with cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=2 to y=9 in min turns.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0, or +1.\n\nSince I need to go up, probably U actions, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars.\n\nBut min turns, so I should go up as much as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, I need to know for each freeway, at each time, whether x=0 is occupied.\n\nTime is in turns, starting from t=9.\n\nLet me define the time from now: let t be the number of turns after t1, so at turn t1, t=0.\n\nSet t=0 at current turn, turn t1=9.\n\nSo at time τ = t, which is turn t1 + τ.\n\nFor a car, at time τ (after t1), the span for a car is:\n\nFor right-moving car: span(τ) = [τ_car + s τ, h_car + s τ] where τ_car and h_car are at t1.\n\nSimilarly for left.\n\n0 is in span if min_span <= 0 <= max_span.\n\nSince the span is an interval, 0 is in it if low <= 0 <= high.\n\nFor each car, I can find when 0 is in its span.\n\nThen for a freeway, at time τ, if any car on that freeway has 0 in span, then occupied, else not.\n\nThen, when I am on freeway y at time τ, I need that y is not occupied at that time.\n\nBut I am on freeway y at time τ only if I am at position y at the beginning of turn τ, I think.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn T, I perform action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nBut the position at turn T is given, then I choose action, then y_{T+1} is set.\n\nCollision is checked at turn T based on y_T.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nWhen I choose action at turn T, it affects y_{T+1}, but at turn T, I am at y_T.\n\nAlso, the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, I am on y_T, and collision is checked based on cars on freeway y_T at time T.\n\nIf I move to y_{T+1} at turn T, at turn T I am still on y_T, so only cars on y_T matter for collision at T.\n\nAt turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}, so cars on y_{T+1} at time T+1 matter.\n\nSo, for each turn, when I am at a certain y, I need that for that y, at that turn, no car at x=0.\n\nNow, for min turns to reach y=9 from y=2.\n\nThe minimal number of turns is at least 7, since 9-2=7, so if I go up every turn, I reach in 7 turns, but I might have to wait or detour if there are collisions.\n\nBut y=9 is safe, so once I reach y=9, I'm done.\n\nThe sequence is until I reach y=9, so H is the number of actions to reach y=9 at turn t1+H-1? Let's see.\n\nStart at turn t1, position (0,y_{t1}) = (0,2)\n\nAfter first action a_{t1}, at turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1+H, position y_{t1+H}\n\nI reach (0,9) when y_{t1+H} = 9 for some H.\n\nThe position after H actions is at turn t1+H.\n\nBut at turn t1+H, I am at y_{t1+H}, and if it is 9, I am done, no collision check needed, I think, since y=9 has no cars.\n\nSimilarly, at start, turn t1, I am at y=2, and I need to check collision at turn t1 for y=2.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9)\", and collision is checked each turn when on freeway.\n\nAt turn when I am at y=9, since no freeway, no collision, so it's fine.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1, H actions, and at turn t1+H, I am at y=9.\n\nNumber of turns from start to end is H, but actions are H, from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nIn the answer format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" up to \"Turn t_1 + H -1: a_{t_1 + H -1}\", so H actions, and after that, at turn t1+H, position is 9.\n\nNow, at each turn T from t1 to t1+H-1, I am at y_T, and I perform action to set y_{T+1}, and collision is checked at T for y_T.\n\nWhen I reach y_{t1+H} =9 at turn t1+H, no action needed, and no collision since not on freeway.\n\nSo I need to ensure that for each turn from t1 to t1+H-1, when I am on a freeway, it is not occupied at that turn.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 are safe, if I am at y=0 or y=9, no issue, but at turn when I am at y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nBut in this case, I start at y=2, end at y=9, so I might be at y=0 or y=9 during the path.\n\nNow for min H, I want to go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut let's first find for each freeway, for each time τ (from t1, τ=0,1,2,...), whether it is occupied.\n\nSet τ = 0 at t1=9.\n\nFor each freeway, find for τ=0,1,2,... whether at time τ, freeway has a car with 0 in span.\n\nStart with freeway 1: y=1\n\nOnly one car: (0, -47, right, 48)\n\nRight-moving, at time τ, span: [τ_car + s τ, h_car + s τ] = [-47 + 48τ, 0 + 48τ] = [48τ -47, 48τ]\n\n0 in span if 48τ -47 <= 0 <= 48τ\n\nSince 48τ -47 <= 0 implies τ <= 47/48 <1, so for τ=0, 48*0 -47 = -47 <=0 <=0, yes 0<=0 true, so at τ=0, occupied.\n\nFor τ=1, [48-47,48] = [1,48], 0 not in, since min=1>0.\n\nSimilarly for τ>0, min=48τ-47, for τ>=1, min>=1>0, so 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 1 occupied only at τ=0.\n\nτ=0 is now, turn t1=9.\n\nNow freeway 2: y=2\n\nTwo cars:\n\nFirst car: (36,25,right,12) span at τ: [25 + 12τ, 36 + 12τ]\n\n0 in [25+12τ, 36+12τ]? 25+12τ <=0<=36+12τ\n\nBut 25+12τ >=25>0 for all τ>=0, so min>0, 0 never in.

From above, y=2 occupied only at τ=1, not at τ=2 or other times. So at τ=2, not occupied, safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can continue up.\n\nBut let's see the occupancy.\n\nFirst, I need to avoid the τ=1 for y=2,3,4,5.\n\ny=2,3,4,5 all occupied at τ=1 only? y=2 at τ=1, y=3 at τ=1, y=4 at τ=1, y=5 at τ=1.\n\ny=6 occupied at τ=0.\n\nNow, for later times, y=7 and y=8 occupied from τ=7 to 10, but that might be far.\n\nFor min time, I might reach before τ=7.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nIf I go down to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nτ=0: at y=2, choose D, then y1=1\n\nAt τ=1: at y=1, choose U, then y2=2\n\nAt τ=2: at y=2, choose U, then y3=3\n\nAt τ=3: at y=3, choose U, then y4=4\n\nAt τ=4: at y=4, choose U, then y5=5\n\nAt τ=5: at y=5, choose U, then y6=6\n\nAt τ=6: at y=6, choose U, then y7=7\n\nAt τ=7: at y=7, but y=7 occupied at τ=7,8,9, so if at τ=7, y=7, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt τ=6, y=6, if I go up to y=7 at τ=7.\n\nBut y=7 occupied at τ=7.\n\nI could stay or something.\n\nBut let's list the positions and times.\n\nIn this path:\n\nTime τ | position y_τ | action a_τ | next y\n\nτ=0: y=2, action D, y1=1\n\nτ=1: y=1, action U, y2=2\n\nτ=2: y=2, action U, y3=3\n\nτ=3: y=3, action U, y4=4\n\nτ=4: y=4, action U, y5=5\n\nτ=5: y=5, action U, y6=6\n\nτ=6: y=6, action U, y7=7\n\nAt τ=6, y=6, I need to check if occupied.\n\ny=6 occupied at τ=0, not at τ=6, so safe at τ=6.\n\nThen action U, to y7=7 at τ=7.\n\nAt τ=7, y=7, and y=7 occupied at τ=7, so collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt τ=6, instead of U, I could choose S, stay at y=6.\n\nThen y7=6\n\nAt τ=7, y=6, not occupied, safe.\n\nBut then I need to go up later.\n\nOr choose D, but going down not helpful.\n\nBut let's see occupancy later.\n\ny=7 occupied τ=7,8,9\n\ny=8 occupied τ=7,8,9,10\n\nI need to go to y=7 or y=8 when not occupied.\n\nFor example, y=7 not occupied when τ<7 or τ>9.\n\nSimilarly y=8 not occupied τ<7 or τ>10.\n\nSince τ=7,8,9,10 occupied for y=8.\n\nτ min to reach y=9.\n\nFrom y=6, to go to y=9, need 3 up actions, but with possible waits.\n\nBut y=7 and y=8 are blocked from τ=7 to 9 and 10.\n\nFirst, at τ=6, I am at y=6.\n\nI can go up to y=7 at τ=7, but occupied.\n\nI can stay at y=6 for some turns until y=7 is free.\n\ny=7 free for τ<=6 or τ>=10.\n\nτ=6 is now, at τ=6 y=6.\n\nIf I go up at τ=6 to y=7 at τ=7, occupied.\n\nIf I stay at τ=6, y=6, then at τ=7, if I am still at y=6, safe, but y=6 is free.\n\nThen at τ=7, I can go to y=7, but at τ=7, y=7 occupied, so if I go to y=7 at τ=7, at τ=7 I am at y=7? No.\n\nAt τ=7, position y_τ, I choose action.\n\nIf at τ=7, I am at y=6, I choose U, then y8=7.\n\nAt τ=7, I am at y=6, collision check for y=6 at τ=7: y=6 not occupied except τ=0, so safe.\n\nThen action U, to y8=7.\n\nNow at τ=8, I am at y=7, and τ=8, y=7 occupied, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I choose to go at later time.\n\nTo avoid collision on y=7, I need to be on y=7 when τ not in 7,8,9.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nThe earliest I can be on y=7 is τ=10, since τ=10 not occupied? y=7 occupied τ=7,8,9, so at τ=10, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly y=8 occupied τ=7,8,9,10, so at τ=11, not occupied.\n\nBut that might be late.\n\nI can be on y=7 at τ=6? τ=6, if I am at y=7 at τ=6.\n\nBut at τ=6, how to be at y=7.\n\nFrom earlier, at τ=6, I am at y=6 in the previous path.\n\nI need to reach y=6 earlier or something.\n\nBut I start from y=2.\n\nMin time to reach y=6.\n\ny=2 to y=6, difference 4, so min 4 turns if go up direct, but might have issues at τ=1.\n\nFirst, let's go back to the beginning.\n\nAt τ=0, y=2.\n\nInstead of going down, I could stay or go up later.\n\nBut at τ=0, if I choose S, stay at y=2, then at τ=1, y=2 occupied, collision.\n\nIf I choose U, at τ=1 y=3 occupied.\n\nSo only choice is to go down to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nAs I had.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=1, safe.\n\nThen I can go up to y=2 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=2 not occupied, safe.\n\nThen to y=3 at τ=3, y=3 not occupied except at τ=1, so at τ=3 safe.\n\nSimilarly y=4 at τ=4, safe.\n\ny=5 at τ=5, safe.\n\ny=6 at τ=6, safe.\n\nNow at τ=6, y=6.\n\nI need to go to y=7, but y=7 occupied from τ=7 to 9.\n\nSo I cannot go to y=7 at τ=7,8,9.\n\nSimilarly, if I go at τ=10, y=7 is free.\n\nBut I can go to y=7 only when I am at y=6 or y=8.\n\nFrom y=6, I go to y=7 at some turn.\n\nBut when I arrive at y=7, it is at turn when I move to it.\n\nFor example, if at time τ, I am at y=6, I choose U, then at τ+1, I am at y=7.\n\nThen at turn τ+1, I am at y=7, so collision if occupied at τ+1.\n\nSimilarly, if I go from y=8 down, but not good.\n\nSo to be at y=7 at turn T, it must not be occupied at T.\n\nAnd I arrive at T from previous position.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nNow, y=7 free for T <=6 or T>=10.\n\nT=6: at T=6, if I am at y=7, is it possible?\n\nAt T=6, y=7.\n\nBut to be at y=7 at T=6, I need to have been at y=6 or y=8 at T=5, and moved.\n\nBut from start, at T=0, y=2, to T=6, only 6 turns, to reach y=7, I need at least 5 up actions, since 7-2=5.\n\nIn 6 turns, I can have 5 up and one stay, or 6 up but y=7 from y=2 is 5 steps up.\n\ny from 2 to 7, delta 5, so min 5 turns.\n\nAt T=5, I could be at y=7.\n\nT=0 to T=5: 5 actions, from y=2 to y=7.\n\nSimilarly, at T=6, position y_6.\n\nIf at T=5, y=7, then at T=5, collision check for y=7 at T=5.\n\nT=5, τ=5, y=7 occupied only at τ=7,8,9, so at τ=5 not occupied, so safe if I can be at y=7 at τ=5.\n\nBut is it possible?\n\nFrom start, τ=0, y=2.\n\nI need to reach y=7 at τ=5.\n\nThat means 5 up actions in 5 turns.\n\nBut at τ=1, if I go up to y=3, occupied, problem.\n\nEarlier at τ=1, y=2,3,4,5 all occupied.\n\nSo I cannot be at y=2,3,4,5 at τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, I must not be on y=2,3,4,5.\n\nThe only safe y at τ=1 is y=1 or y=6 or y=7,8 but y=7,8 not yet, or y=0,9.\n\ny=1 at τ=1 is safe, as we had.\n\ny=6 at τ=1: is it occupied? y=6 occupied only at τ=0, not at τ=1, so at τ=1, y=6 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nBut I start at y=2, at τ=0.\n\nAt τ=0, if I go up to y=3, but at τ=1 I am at y=3 occupied.\n\nIf I go down to y=1, at τ=1 y=1 safe.\n\nIf I go to y=6?

From τ=1 to τ=6, 5 actions: actions at τ=1 to τ=5 determine y at τ=6.\n\nAt τ=1, position y=1.\n\nAfter action at τ=1, y2 set, and so on, up to action at τ=5, y6 set.\n\nTo have y6=7, from y1=1, I need y6 = y1 + sum of Δy from τ=1 to 5.\n\nEach Δy in {-1,0,1}, so y6 <= y1 +5 =6, or y6 >= y1 -5 = -4, but y>=0, so y6 <=6.\n\nCannot reach y=7 at τ=6 from y=1 at τ=1 in 5 actions; max y=6.\n\nSimilarly, min y=1-5= -4, not possible, so y=0 to 6 possible.\n\nSo at τ=6, the highest I can be is y=6, if I go up every turn from τ=1 to 5.\n\nAt τ=1, y=1, action U, y2=2 at τ=2\n\nAction U, y3=3 at τ=3\n\nU, y4=4 at τ=4\n\nU, y5=5 at τ=5\n\nU, y6=6 at τ=6\n\nThen at τ=6, y=6.\n\nIf I go faster, but no, each step +1 max.\n\nSo at τ=6, I must be at y=6 or less.\n\nThen from y=6 at τ=6, I can go to y=7 at τ=7, but y=7 occupied at τ=7.\n\nOr later.\n\nThe earliest I can be at y=7 is τ=10, by waiting at y=6.\n\nThen to y=8 at τ=11, y=9 at τ=12.\n\nAs before.\n\nBut at τ=10, y=7, then to y=8 at τ=11.\n\ny=8 at τ=11, not occupied, safe.\n\nThen to y=9 at τ=12.\n\nBut is there a way to be at y=8 earlier?\n\ny=8 free for τ<=6 or τ>=11.\n\nAt τ=6, I can be at y=6, not y=8.\n\nTo be at y=8 at τ=6, from y=2 at τ=0, in 6 actions, max y=8, but with the constraint at τ=1.\n\nFrom τ=0, y=2.\n\nTo reach high y quickly.\n\nBut at τ=1, I must be at y=1.\n\nSo at τ=1, y=1.\n\nThen at τ=2, y<=2\n\nτ=3, y<=3\n\n...\n\nτ=6, y<=6\n\nSo impossible to be at y=7 or 8 at τ=6.\n\nTherefore, the earliest to reach y=7 is after the occupation, at τ=10.\n\nThen y=8 at τ=11, y=9 at τ=12.\n\nBut at τ=12, y=9.\n\nH=12 actions from τ=0 to τ=11.\n\nActions at τ=0 to τ=11, 12 actions.\n\nBut perhaps I can reach y=9 earlier if I go directly to y=9 from y=8, but y=8 occupied until τ=10.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=0 and wait, but that would be slower.\n\nOr, at some point, go down to avoid, but not helpful.\n\nPerhaps for y=7 and y=8, since the occupation is later, I can be there before τ=7.\n\nFor example, be at y=7 at τ=6.\n\nBut as above, cannot, because from start, with τ=1 constraint, I can only be at y=6 at τ=6.\n\nUnless I can be at higher y at earlier times, but at τ=1 I am at y=1.\n\nSuppose at τ=0, I go down to y=1, but at τ=0, if I go down, y1=1 at τ=1.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAt τ=0, only choices: U, S, D, all lead to collision except D to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nS or U lead to y=2 or y=3 at τ=1, both occupied.\n\nSo must go to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nThen I am stuck with slow progress.\n\nBut let's confirm the occupancy at other times.\n\nFor example, at τ=2, y=2 is safe, etc.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=6 faster.\n\nFrom y=1 at τ=1, to y=6 at τ=6, as above, 5 steps: y=1 to2,2 to3,3 to4,4 to5,5 to6, so at τ=6 y=6.\n\nIf I could skip some, but no.\n\nAnother thought: since y=6 is safe after τ=0, and I can be there from τ=1 on.\n\nBut to reach it, from y=1 at τ=1, I need 5 steps to y=6 at τ=6.\n\nThen from there, to y=7 at τ=10, etc.\n\nBut perhaps I can be at y=8 at τ=6, but impossible.\n\nOr, I can go to y=7 at τ=10, but then to y=8 at τ=11, which is occupied? y=8 occupied until τ=10, so at τ=11 free.\n\nτ=11 free.\n\nBut let's see if I can reduce the waiting time.\n\nFor example, at τ=6, y=6, instead of waiting 3 turns to go at τ=10, but I have to wait because y=7 occupied τ=7,8,9.\n\nI can go to y=5 or something, but not helpful.\n\nOr, since y=0 is safe, I can go down to y=0 and come back, but that takes more turns.\n\nFor example, from y=6 at τ=6, go down to y=5 at τ=7, but y=5 is free, at τ=7 y=5 safe, then to y=4, etc, but that is away from target.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo the only way is to wait at y=6 until τ=9, then go to y=7 at τ=10.\n\nIn the sequence, at τ=6,7,8,9 I am at y=6, but at τ=9, I go to y=7 at τ=10.\n\nIn terms of turns:\n\nAt τ=6: y=6, action S or whatever to stay.\n\nBut at τ=6, I can choose to stay, so y7=6.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut to save time, perhaps I can be at y=7 earlier if I start from lower, but no.\n\nAnother idea: at the beginning, instead of going down, I go up at τ=0 to y=3, but at τ=1 y=3 occupied, collision, not allowed.\n\nSo I think I have to accept H=12.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach y=9 at τ=11 or something.\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=8 at τ=10 or 11.\n\nAt τ=10, y=8 occupied, not free.\n\ny=8 free only τ<=6 or τ>=11.\n\nAt τ=6, I can be at y=6.\n\nIf at τ=6, I go up to y=7 at τ=7, occupied.\n\nNot possible.\n\nAt τ=5, I am at y=5 or 6.\n\nAt τ=5, y=5, I can go to y=6 at τ=6.\n\nBut same as before.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=6 earlier.\n\nFrom start, at τ=0, y=2, go down to y=1 at τ=1.\n\nThen from τ=1 y=1, go up every turn: at τ=2 y=2, τ=3 y=3, τ=4 y=4, τ=5 y=5, τ=6 y=6.\n\nAs before.\n\nNo faster way.\n\nThen from τ=6 y=6, I stay for 3 turns: at τ=6, action S, y7=6\n\nτ=7, y=6, action S, y8=6\n\nτ=8, y=6, action S, y9=6\n\nτ=9, y=6, action U, y10=7\n\nτ=10, y=7, action U, y11=8\n\nτ=11, y=8, action U, y12=9\n\nAt τ=12, y=9.\n\nBut at τ=11, y=8, is it safe? τ=11, y=8 not occupied, yes.\n\nActions from τ=0 to τ=11, 12 actions.\n\nBut H is the number of actions, so 12.\n\nThe sequence is for turns t1 to t1+H-1, with H=12.\n\nCurrent turn t1=9.\n\nBut perhaps I can reduce by one.\n\nAt τ=9, instead of staying at y=6, I can go to y=7 at τ=10, but at τ=10 y=7 is free, but I need to go from y=6 to y=7.\n\nIn the above, at τ=9 I go from y=6 to y=7 at τ=10.\n\nThen to y=8 at τ=11, to y=9 at τ=12.\n\nIf I could be at y=7 at τ=9, but y=7 occupied at τ=9, not safe.\n\nOr at τ=10, y=7.\n\nBut to reach y=9 faster, from y=7 at τ=10, to y=8 at τ=11, y=9 at τ=12.\n\nBut y=8 at τ=11 is safe.\n\nCan I reach y=8 at τ=11 from below.\n\nFrom y=6 at τ=9, I go to y=7 at τ=10, then to y=8 at τ=11.\n\nSame.\n\nPerhaps I can go directly to y=9 from y=7, but no, must step through y=8.\n\nUnless I am at y=8, then to y=9.\n\nBut y=8 must be safe when I am there.\n\nAt τ=11, y=8 safe.\n\nBut let's see if I can arrive at y=9 at τ=11.\n\nThat means at τ=11, y=9.\n\nSo at τ=10, I am at y=8 or y=9? If at τ=10, I am at y=8, I choose U, to y=9 at τ=11.\n\nBut at τ=10, if I am at y=8, is it safe? y=8 occupied at τ=10, so at τ=10, if on y=8, collision.\n\nIf at τ=10, I am at y=9, then no action needed, but I arrive at τ=10.\n\nTo be at y=9 at τ=10.\n\nFrom start, in 10 turns, from y=2 to y=9, delta 7, min 7 turns, but with constraints.\n\nBut at τ=1, I am at y=1, then to y=9 in 9 actions? From τ=1 y=1 to τ=10 y=9, 9 actions, min delta 8, so possible with 8 up and one down or something, but net +8 from y=1 to y=9, so 8 up actions needed, with 9 actions, I can have 8 up and one stay, for example.\n\nBut can I avoid the τ=1 issue and reach high fast.\n\nAt τ=1, I am at y=1.\n\nThen I need to go to y=9 at τ=10.\n\nWith 9 actions from τ=1 to τ=9, setting y at τ=10.\n\nActions at τ=1 to τ=9 determine y2 to y10.\n\nTo have y10=9.\n\nFrom y1=1, need y10 =1 + sum_{k=1 to 9} Δy_k\n\nEach Δy in {-1,0,1}, so y10 <=1+9=10, but y<=9, so y10<=9, possible with sum Δy =8, so 8 up and 1 down or 8 up and 1 stay, etc.\n\nBut to minimize time, I want to go up fast.\n\nBut at the same time, for y=7 and y=8, I need to be there when safe.\n\ny=7 safe for τ<=6 or τ>=10.\n\nAt τ=10, I am at y=9 or y=8, etc.\n\nAt τ=10, if I am at y=7, it is safe, but I want to be at y=9.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 safe at τ<=6 or τ>=11.\n\nAt τ=10, y=8 occupied.\n\nSo if I am at y=8 at τ=10, collision.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be on y=8 at τ=10.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=11, safe.\n\nSo to reach y=9 at τ=11, I need to be at y=8 at τ=10 or τ=11.\n\nBut at τ=10, y=8 occupied, so I cannot be at y=8 at τ=10.\n\nTherefore, the earliest to be at y=8 is τ=11.\n\nThen at τ=11, y=8, I can go to y=9 at τ=12.\n\nIf I am at y=8 at τ=11, then action U to y=9 at τ=12.\n\nTo be at y=8 at τ=11.\n\nFrom start, how to reach y=8 at τ=11.\n\nWith the path, from τ=0 y=2, go to τ=1 y=1, then to τ=6 y=6, then wait until τ=9 at y=6, then to y=7 at τ=10, then to y=8 at τ=11.\n\nThen to y=9 at τ=12.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAt τ=10, I am at y=7, safe, then to y=8 at τ=11, safe, then to y=9 at τ=12.\n\nNo way to be at y=8 earlier.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 12.\n\nBut let's list the sequence.\n\nCurrent turn t1=9.\n\nAt turn t=9 (τ=0): position y=2, choose action D (down) to go to y=1.\n\nThen at turn t=10 (τ=1): position y=1, choose action U (up) to go to y=2.\n\nTurn t=11 (τ=2): y=2, action U to y=3.\n\nt=12 (τ=3): y=3, action U to y=4.\n\nt=13 (τ=4): y=4, action U to y=5.\n\nt=14 (τ=5): y=5, action U to y=6.\n\nt=15 (τ=6): y=6, action S (stay) to y=6.\n\nt=16 (τ=7): y=6, action S to y=6.\n\nt=17 (τ=8): y=6, action S to y=6.\n\nt=18 (τ=9): y=6, action U to y=7.\n\nt=19 (τ=10): y=7, action U to y=8.\n\nt=20 (τ=11): y=8, action U to y=9.\n\nAt turn t=20, position y=9, done.\n\nNumber of actions from t=9 to t=19, that's 11 actions?

Let's list turns:\n\nTurn t | position y_t | action a_t | next y\n\nt=9: y=2, action D, y10=1\n\nt=10: y=1, action U, y11=2\n\nt=11: y=2, action U, y12=3\n\nt=12: y=3, action U, y13=4\n\nt=13: y=4, action U, y14=5\n\nt=14: y=5, action U, y15=6\n\nt=15: y=6, action S, y16=6\n\nt=16: y=6, action S, y17=6\n\nt=17: y=6, action S, y18=6\n\nt=18: y=6, action U, y19=7\n\nt=19: y=7, action U, y20=8\n\nAt t=19, y=7, action U, to y20=8\n\nThen I need another action to go to y=9.\n\nAt t=20: y=8, action U, y21=9\n\nAt t=21, y=9.\n\nI missed that.\n\nIn my earlier, at τ=10 (t=19), y=7, action U to y=8 at t=20.\n\nThen at t=20, y=8, action U to y=9 at t=21.\n\nSo actions at t=9 to t=20, 12 actions.\n\nt=9 to t=20 inclusive? t=9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20: that's 12 actions.\n\nThen at t=21, y=9.\n\nWith H=12.\n\nIn the sequence I had up to t=19 action to y=8, then need t=20 action to y=9.\n\nSo H=12.\n\nBut in the waiting, at t=15,16,17 I stayed at y=6, but at t=18 I went to y=7 at t=19.\n\nt=18: y=6, action U, y19=7\n\nt=19: y=7, action U, y20=8\n\nt=20: y=8, action U, y21=9\n\nYes.\n\nTo save one turn, if I can go to y=7 at t=19, but at t=19, τ=10, y=7 safe, but from there to y=8 at t=20, occupied, so at t=20, if on y=8, collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nGo directly from y=7 to y=9, impossible.\n\nSo I think H=12 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm if at the beginning I can avoid the down move.\n\nSuppose at τ=0, t=9, y=2, I choose U, to y=3 at t=10.\n\nBut at t=10, y=3, and τ=1, y=3 occupied, collision, not allowed.\n\nSimilarly, S, to y=2 at t=10, occupied.\n\nD is only choice.\n\nSo yes.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 6, at τ=0 occupied, but I am at y=2, not on y=6.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSo I think this is the way.\n\nNow for the sequence.\n\nCurrent turn t1=9.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: S\n\nTurn 17: S\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 15: y=6, action S\n\nTurn 16: y=6, action S\n\nTurn 17: y=6, action S\n\nBut at turn 17, τ=8, y=6 safe.\n\nThen turn 18: y=6, action U to y=7\n\nBut turn 18 is t=18, τ=9? t1=9, τ=0 at t=9.\n\nt=18 is τ=9.\n\nAt τ=9, position y=6, action U, to y=7 at τ=10, t=19.\n\nThen at t=19, y=7, action U to y=8 at t=20.\n\nt=20, y=8, action U to y=9 at t=21.\n\nIn the action list, the last action is at turn 20.\n\nAnd H=12.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be the actions from turn t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nWith H=12, t1=9, so turns 9 to 20.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U (to y=3? At turn 11, y=2? Let's list with positions to be clear.\n\nTurn 9: position (0,2), action D, so to y=1\n\nTurn 10: position (0,1), action U, to y=2\n\nTurn 11: position (0,2), action U, to y=3\n\nTurn 12: position (0,3), action U, to y=4\n\nTurn 13: position (0,4), action U, to y=5\n\nTurn 14: position (0,5), action U, to y=6\n\nTurn 15: position (0,6), action S, to y=6\n\nTurn 16: position (0,6), action S, to y=6\n\nTurn 17: position (0,6), action S, to y=6\n\nTurn 18: position (0,6), action U, to y=7\n\nTurn 19: position (0,7), action U, to y=8\n\nTurn 20: position (0,8), action U, to y=9\n\nAt turn 21, position (0,9), no action.\n\nSo actions from turn 9 to 20, 12 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 18, action U from y=6 to y=7.\n\nAt turn 19, from y=7 to y=8.\n\nTurn 20, from y=8 to y=9.\n\nAll safe.\n\nAt turn 19, y=7, τ=10, not occupied, safe.\n\nTurn 20, y=8, τ=11, not occupied, safe.\n\nAnd no other collisions.\n\nSo minimal H=12.\n\nBut is there a way with H=11?\n\nSuppose I can reach y=6 earlier, but cannot.\n\nAt turn 14, I am at y=6, since from turn 9 to 14: actions U,U,U,U,U? From turn 9: D to y=1 at t10.\n\nThen U to y=2 t11, U to y=3 t12, U to y=4 t13, U to y=5 t14, U to y=6 at t15.\n\nAt turn 14: position y=5, action U to y=6 at t15.\n\nSo at turn 15, y=6.\n\nIf I go up at turn 15 to y=7 at t16, but at t16, y=7, τ=7, occupied, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nGo down, not good.\n\nSo must stay.\n\nThus H=12 is minimal.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nCurrent turn t1=9.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 9: D\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: S\n\nTurn 17: S\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nIn the waiting, I stayed at y=6 for turns 15,16,17 with S actions.\n\nAt turn 18, U to y=7.\n\nBut turn 18 is τ=9, which is before τ=10, but I go to y=7 at τ=10.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be fine.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, the occupation starts at τ=7, but since I avoid, ok.\n\nI think this is correct.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 2) at turn \\(t_1 = 9\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the sequence of actions must account for the car movements and occupancy at each turn.\n\n### Key Constraints from Car Occupancy:\n- At turn \\(t_1 = 9\\) (\\(\\tau = 0\\)), freeway \\(y = 1\\) is occupied, and freeway \\(y = 6\\) is occupied.\n- At turn \\(t_1 + 1 = 10\\) (\\(\\tau = 1\\)), freeways \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5\\) are occupied.\n- Freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) are occupied from turns \\(t_1 + 7 = 16\\) (\\(\\tau = 7\\)) to \\(t_1 + 9 = 18\\) (\\(\\tau = 9\\)) for \\(y = 7\\), and from \\(t_1 + 7 = 16\\) to \\(t_1 + 10 = 19\\) (\\(\\tau = 10\\)) for \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe minimal path requires moving down to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 10 to avoid the occupancy at \\(y = 2, 3, 4, 5\\) at turn 10, then moving up to \\(y = 6\\) by turn 15. However, \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\) are occupied from turns 16 to 19, so the player must wait at \\(y = 6\\) for three turns (turns 15, 16, and 17) before proceeding up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 19 and \\(y = 8\\) at turn 20, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 21.\n\n### Action Sequence (12 Actions, \\(H = 12\\)):\n- **Turn 9 (\\(t_1\\))**: Action \\(D\\) (down) to move to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 10.

At turn 10, the player is at \\(y = 1\\), which is not occupied (only occupied at turn 9), so no collision.\n- **Turn 11**: Action \\(U\\) to move to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 12. At turn 11, \\(y = 2\\) is not occupied (only occupied at turn 10), so no collision.\n- **Turn 12**: Action \\(U\\) to move to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 13. At turn 12, \\(y = 3\\) is not occupied (only occupied at turn 10), so no collision.\n- **Turn 13**: Action \\(U\\) to move to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 14. At turn 13, \\(y = 4\\) is not occupied (only occupied at turn 10), so no collision.\n- **Turn 14**: Action \\(U\\) to move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 15.

At turn 15, \\(y = 6\\) is not occupied (only occupied at turn 9), so no collision.\n- **Turn 16**: Action \\(S\\) to remain at \\(y = 6\\) for turn 17. At turn 16, \\(y = 6\\) is not occupied, so no collision.\n- **Turn 17**: Action \\(S\\) to remain at \\(y = 6\\) for turn 18.

We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T if the player is at (0, y_T) and there is a car on freeway y_T such that 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nNote: The player is only on one freeway per turn. When moving, at turn T the player is on freeway y_T. At the next turn, when the player moves to y_{T+1}, they are not on freeway y_{T+1} until turn T+1.\n\nCar update: \n  For a car on freeway i (which is fixed for that car), at time T (relative to t1=10), the car's span is updated as:\n    Left-moving: [h - s*(T - 10), τ - s*(T - 10)]   [since T>t1, and the car moves left (decreasing x)]\n    Right-moving: [τ + s*(T - 10), h + s*(T - 10)]   [because for right-moving, the head is at h and tail at τ, and as time goes the head moves right and tail moves right]\n\nBut note: The initial state is given at turn t1=10.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway k (from 1 to 8) at a turn T (>=10) when there is a car on that freeway that has 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nWe start at y=1 (freeway 1) at turn 10. Our goal is to get to y=9 (which is the top, above freeway 8) but note the grid: vertical axis y=0,1,...,9. The freeways are from y=1 to y=8. So y=9 is the goal and is above the freeways, so we don't have to worry about cars at y=9.\n\nWe can only change our y by +1 (U), -1 (D), or 0 (S) each turn, and we must stay in [0,9]. We start at y=1 and want to get to y=9.\n\nWe must avoid collisions on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nWe are to output the sequence of actions starting at turn 10 (t1) for H turns until we reach y=9 at the last action (so after H-1 actions, we are at y=9 at turn 10+H-1).\n\nWe need the minimal H and the sequence.\n\nLet me list the car states at turn 10 (current turn) for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (48, 1, right, 48)\n  This is right-moving. The head is at 48, tail at 1? But for right-moving, the head should be the rightmost? Actually, the representation says: for right-moving, the car is from tail to head: [τ, h] and they are increasing? But the update rule for right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-10), h + s*(T-10)]\n\nBut note: the initial state at T=10: \n  For right-moving: [τ + s*0, h + s*0] = [τ, h] = [1,48]? But wait, the table says: (48, 1, right, 48). \n\nHow to interpret? The table says: (head, tail, direction, speed). So for right-moving, the head is the rightmost? Then at T=10, the car spans from tail to head: [τ, h] = [1,48]? But that would be a long car from 1 to 48. However, the update rule for right-moving: \n  Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut wait, the table says: head=48, tail=1. So at T=10: the car is from 1 to 48? Then at T>10, it moves right: so the tail becomes 1 + s*(T-10) and head becomes 48 + s*(T-10).\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: head is the leftmost? The table says: (-24,11,left,36) for freeway 4 and 5. So at T=10: the car is from head to tail? But the update: [h - s*(T-10), τ - s*(T-10)] = [-24 - s*(T-10), 11 - s*(T-10)].\n\nBut note: the representation in the update rule for left-moving: the span is [h, τ] and then it moves left. So at T=10, the car is at [h, τ] = [-24, 11]? That would be a car from -24 to 11? But that's a large car. Actually, the head is the leftmost and the tail is the rightmost? So the car covers [-24, 11]. Then as time goes, the car moves left: both endpoints decrease.\n\nNow, we need to check for each freeway and each future turn T if the car spans at T include 0.\n\nBut note: there can be multiple cars on a freeway. So we must check all cars on a freeway when the player is on that freeway at turn T.\n\nLet me write down for each freeway the cars and their positions at time T (relative to t0=10, so let t = T - 10, so at t=0 we are at turn 10).\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head=48, tail=1, right, s=48)\n  At time t (after 10): \n      tail(t) = 1 + 48*t\n      head(t) = 48 + 48*t\n  The car is on the freeway at time t? The car is always on freeway 1. The span is [1+48t, 48+48t]. \n  We need 0 in [1+48t, 48+48t]? \n      1+48t <= 0 <= 48+48t\n      Since 1+48t is always positive for t>=0, 0 is never in the interval. So freeway 1 is safe at all times? \n\nBut wait: t=0: [1,48] -> 0 is not in [1,48]. So freeway 1 is safe.\n\nFreeway 2: two cars:\n  Car1: (48, 37, right, 12) -> wait, head=48, tail=37? That seems backwards. Because for a right-moving car, the head should be the rightmost and tail the leftmost? But 37 to 48 is a car of length 12? But the speed is 12? \n\nBut note: the representation: (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving, the car is from tail to head? Or head to tail? The update rule for right-moving: \n  Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-10), h + s*(T-10)]\n\nBut in the table, it's (head, tail). So τ is tail? Then for the first car: τ=37, h=48? Then at T=10: [37,48]. Then at time t: [37+12t, 48+12t].\n\nSimilarly, the second car: (0, -11, right, 12): at T=10: [-11,0]? Then at time t: [-11+12t, 0+12t] = [12t-11, 12t].\n\nSo freeway 2 has two cars at time t:\n  Car1: [37+12t, 48+12t]\n  Car2: [12t-11, 12t]\n\nWe need to check if 0 is in either of these intervals at time t.\n\nFor Car1: 37+12t <= 0 <= 48+12t? \n  Since 37+12t >= 37 >0 for t>=0, so 0 is not in Car1.\n\nFor Car2: 12t-11 <= 0 <= 12t?\n  => 12t-11 <= 0 and 0 <= 12t\n  => t <= 11/12 and t>=0 -> t=0: 12*0-11 = -11 <=0<=0 -> 0 is in [-11,0] at t=0? \n  But t=0 is turn 10: the car is at [-11,0]. So 0 is included? \n\nWait: the car at t=0 (turn 10) is at [-11,0]. That includes 0? Yes, because the car covers from -11 to 0, so 0 is the head? \n\nBut note: the player is at (0, y) and if the freeway is y=2, then at turn 10 if the player is on freeway 2, then we check if 0 is in the car's span. At turn 10, for freeway 2, the second car has 0 in its span. Therefore, freeway 2 is dangerous at t=0 (turn 10).\n\nBut we start at freeway 1 at turn 10, so we are not on freeway 2 at turn 10. However, we might move to freeway 2 at a future turn.\n\nSo at turn T (>=10), if we are on freeway 2, we must avoid the times when 0 is in either car.\n\nFor Car2: 0 in [12t-11,12t] when 12t-11<=0<=12t -> t<=11/12 and t>=0 -> so only at t=0? But t is integer? Because turns are discrete. So t is integer (nonnegative). \n\nAt t=0: [ -11, 0] -> includes 0? Yes.\nAt t=1: [1,12] -> 0 not included? \nAt t=2: [13,24] -> no.\n\nBut wait: 12t-11 <= 0 <= 12t\n  For t=0: -11<=0<=0 -> true.\n  For t=1: 1<=0<=12 -> false (because 1<=0 is false).\n  So only at t=0 (turn 10) the second car on freeway 2 is at 0.\n\nBut note: the first car is safe as we saw.\n\nSo freeway 2 is only dangerous at t=0 (turn 10). Since we are not on freeway 2 at turn 10, we can be on freeway 2 at any other turn (t>=1) without collision.\n\nHowever, we must also consider the other car? The first car: [37+12t,48+12t] never contains 0.\n\nSo freeway 2: safe for t>=1.\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? \n  The table says: same two cars: (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12). \n  So same as freeway 2: only dangerous at t=0 (turn 10). \n\nFreeway 4: one car: (-24,11,left,36)\n  Left-moving: update: [h - s*t, τ - s*t] = [-24 - 36t, 11 - 36t]\n  We need 0 in [-24-36t, 11-36t]?\n      -24-36t <= 0 <= 11-36t\n\n  Break into two inequalities:\n      0 <= 11-36t  => 36t <= 11 => t <= 11/36 -> t=0 only? (since t>=0 integer)\n      and -24-36t <= 0 => -36t <= 24 => t >= -24/36 -> true for all t>=0.\n\n  At t=0: [-24,11] -> 0 is in the interval? Yes.\n\n  At t=1: [-24-36, 11-36] = [-60,-25] -> 0 not included.\n\n  So freeway 4 is dangerous at t=0 (turn 10) only.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 4? Yes, same car: (-24,11,left,36). So dangerous only at t=0.\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (12,1,right,6)\n  Right-moving: [τ + 6t, h + 6t] = [1+6t, 12+6t]   [because head=12, tail=1?]\n  Check 0 in [1+6t,12+6t]? \n      1+6t <= 0 <= 12+6t -> \n        First: 1+6t<=0 -> t<=-1/6 -> false for t>=0.\n      So never.\n\nFreeway 6 is always safe.\n\nFreeway 7: two cars:\n  Car1: (-24,-35,right,4) -> right-moving: [τ +4t, h+4t] = [-35+4t, -24+4t]   [because head=-24, tail=-35?]\n  Car2: (40,29,right,4) -> [29+4t,40+4t]\n\n  Check Car1: 0 in [-35+4t, -24+4t]?\n      -35+4t <= 0 <= -24+4t\n      => 4t <=35 -> t<=35/4=8.75, and 4t>=24 -> t>=6.\n      So t=6,7,8: \n          t=6: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0] -> includes 0? \n          t=7: [-35+28, -24+28] = [-7,4] -> includes 0? \n          t=8: [-35+32, -24+32] = [-3,8] -> includes 0.\n\n      Actually, at t=6: the interval is [-11,0] -> 0 is the head? So included? Yes.\n      t=7: [-7,4] includes 0? Yes.\n      t=8: [-3,8] includes 0? Yes.\n\n  Check Car2: [29+4t,40+4t] -> all positive and increasing, so 0 never in it.\n\n  So freeway 7 is dangerous at t=6,7,8 (i.e., turns 16,17,18).\n\nFreeway 8: one car: (-18,-29,right,3)\n  Right-moving: [τ +3t, h+3t] = [-29+3t, -18+3t]\n  Check 0 in [-29+3t, -18+3t]?\n      -29+3t <=0 <= -18+3t\n      => 3t<=29 -> t<=29/3≈9.66, and 3t>=18 -> t>=6.\n      So t=6,7,8,9:\n          t=6: [-29+18, -18+18] = [-11,0] -> includes 0? Yes.\n          t=7: [-29+21, -18+21] = [-8,3] -> includes 0? Yes.\n          t=8: [-29+24, -18+24] = [-5,6] -> includes 0? Yes.\n          t=9: [-29+27, -18+27] = [-2,9] -> includes 0? Yes.\n\n  So freeway 8 is dangerous at t=6,7,8,9 (turns 16,17,18,19).\n\nSummary of dangerous freeways and turns (relative to t1=10, so turn T = 10 + t):\n\n- Freeway 1: safe at all times.\n- Freeway 2: dangerous only at t=0 (turn 10) -> but we are not on it at turn 10, so safe for t>=1.\n- Freeway 3: same as freeway 2: dangerous only at t=0 -> safe for t>=1.\n- Freeway 4: dangerous at t=0 -> safe for t>=1.\n- Freeway 5: same as freeway 4: dangerous at t=0 -> safe for t>=1.\n- Freeway 6: safe at all times.\n- Freeway 7: dangerous at t=6 (turn 16), t=7 (turn 17), t=8 (turn 18).\n- Freeway 8: dangerous at t=6 (turn 16), t=7 (turn 17), t=8 (turn 18), t=9 (turn 19).\n\nWe start at y=1 (freeway 1) at turn 10 (t=0). We are safe at turn 10 because freeway 1 is safe.\n\nGoal: get to y=9. We must pass through freeways 2 to 8. We can also stay at a freeway or even go down? But we start at 1 and need to go to 9, so we must go up.\n\nThe minimal number of moves? We are at y=1 and need to go to y=9: that's 8 steps up. But we can also stay? But staying doesn't help? Actually, we might have to wait to avoid dangerous times.\n\nSo minimal H? We must have at least 8 moves (each U) to go from 1 to 9. But we can also mix with stays? But if we do 8 U without any stay, we would take 8 turns: \n  Turn 10: start at 1 -> then\n  Turn 10: action U -> turn 11: at 2\n  Turn 11: U -> turn12: at3\n  Turn12: U -> turn13: at4\n  Turn13: U -> turn14: at5\n  Turn14: U -> turn15: at6\n  Turn15: U -> turn16: at7\n  Turn16: U -> turn17: at8\n  Turn17: U -> turn18: at9.\n\nBut wait, we are at 9 at turn18? Then we are done at turn18? So H=8? But we start at turn10, and we do 8 actions: from turn10 to turn17? Then at turn17 we do the last U and then at turn18 we are at 9.\n\nBut we must check the positions at each turn:\n\n  Turn10: y=1 -> safe (freeway1 safe)\n  Turn11: y=2 -> freeway2: safe (since t=1, and freeway2 is safe for t>=1)\n  Turn12: y=3 -> freeway3: safe (t=2>=1 -> safe)\n  Turn13: y=4 -> freeway4: safe (t=3>=1 -> safe)\n  Turn14: y=5 -> freeway5: safe (t=4>=1 -> safe)\n  Turn15: y=6 -> freeway6: safe (always)\n  Turn16: y=7 -> freeway7: dangerous at t=6 (which is turn16) -> so we are at freeway7 at turn16 and it's dangerous! Collision.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at freeway7 at turn16.\n\nSimilarly, at turn17: we would be at freeway8? But freeway8 is dangerous at turn17? Actually, at turn17: t=7, and freeway8 is dangerous at t=6,7,8,9 -> so turn16,17,18,19. So at turn17: freeway8 is dangerous.\n\nSo the naive path collides at turn16 and also at turn17 (if we get to freeway8 at turn17).\n\nWe must avoid freeway7 at turns 16,17,18 and freeway8 at turns16,17,18,19.\n\nWe need to adjust the timing.\n\nWe have two options: \n  Option 1: slow down so that we hit freeway7 and freeway8 after the dangerous periods.\n  Option 2: speed up to get through before the dangerous periods? But we start at turn10 and the dangerous periods start at turn16 (for freeway7) and turn16 for freeway8. We are at y=1 at turn10. We need to get to y=7 at least by turn15 to avoid freeway7 at turn16? But then we can go to y=8 at turn16? But freeway8 is dangerous at turn16.\n\nAlternatively, we can wait at a safe freeway until the dangerous period is over.\n\nLet me compute the times:\n\nWe must avoid:\n  freeway7 at turns 16,17,18 (t=6,7,8)\n  freeway8 at turns 16,17,18,19 (t=6,7,8,9)\n\nThe dangerous periods for freeway7: turns 16,17,18 -> so we cannot be on freeway7 at these turns.\nSimilarly, freeway8: turns16,17,18,19.\n\nWe need to pass through freeway7 and freeway8 at safe times.\n\nSafe times for freeway7: all turns except 16,17,18 -> so before turn16 or after turn18.\nSafe times for freeway8: before turn16 or after turn19.\n\nBut note: we are going up. We must go from y=6 (freeway6) to y=7 (freeway7) to y=8 (freeway8) to y=9.\n\nWe can also consider going up and then down? But that would take more moves. We want minimal H.\n\nLet me think about the minimal delay.\n\nWe have to be at freeway7 at a safe time: either <= turn15 or >= turn19.\nSimilarly, freeway8: <= turn15 or >= turn20.\n\nBut we are at y=1 at turn10. We can get to y=6 as early as turn15 (by doing U every turn: 5 moves: 1->2 at turn11, 2->3 at12, 3->4 at13, 4->5 at14, 5->6 at15).\n\nThen at turn15 we are at y=6 (safe). Then:\n\nIf we go up at turn15: then at turn16 we are at y=7 -> but turn16 is dangerous for freeway7 -> collision.\n\nSo we must wait at y=6 until we can safely move to y=7 and then to y=8.\n\nHow long to wait? The next safe time for freeway7 is turn19 (because at turn18 we are still dangerous, and turn19: t=9 -> for freeway7: t=9: the car positions? \n  For freeway7, Car1: [-35+4*9, -24+4*9] = [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12] -> does not include 0 -> safe.\n  Car2: [29+36,40+36] = [65,76] -> safe.\n  So freeway7 is safe at turn19.\n\nBut then we can go:\n  turn19: at y=6 -> move U to y=7 (at turn20? No: at turn19 we are at y=6, then we do U at turn19 and then at turn20 we are at y=7? \n\nWait: \n  At turn T, we are at y_T. Then we choose an action a_T that determines y_{T+1}.\n  So if we are at turn19 at y=6, then we do U: so at turn20 we are at y=7.\n\nBut at turn20, for freeway7: t=10 (since t=T-10, T=20 -> t=10). \n  Freeway7: Car1: [-35+4*10, -24+4*10] = [5,16] -> safe.\n  Car2: [29+40,40+40]=[69,80] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway7 is safe at turn20.\n\nSimilarly, we then need to go to freeway8. When we go to freeway8 at a safe time? The next safe time for freeway8 after turn19? \n  We need freeway8 safe at the turn we are on it.\n\nAt turn20: freeway8: \n  t=10: [-29+3*10, -18+3*10] = [1,12] -> does not include 0? 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo we can do:\n  turn19: at y=6, do U -> at turn20: y=7 (freeway7, safe)\n  turn20: do U -> at turn21: y=8 (freeway8, safe? at turn21: t=11 -> freeway8: [-29+33, -18+33]=[4,15] -> safe)\n  turn21: do U -> at turn22: y=9 -> goal.\n\nBut we started at turn10 at y=1.\n\nWe need to get to y=6 by turn19? But we can get there earlier and wait? \n\nHow do we get to y=6? We can get to y=6 at turn15 (as above) and then wait at y=6 until turn19? That is, we do S (stay) for 4 turns: turns15,16,17,18? Then at turn18 we are still at y=6? Then at turn19 we do U to go to y=7.\n\nBut then the sequence:\n\nTurn10: at y=1 -> do U -> turn11: y=2\nTurn11: U -> turn12: y=3\nTurn12: U -> turn13: y=4\nTurn13: U -> turn14: y=5\nTurn14: U -> turn15: y=6\nThen we wait at y=6 for 4 turns: \n  Turn15: S -> turn16: still y=6\n  Turn16: S -> turn17: y=6\n  Turn17: S -> turn18: y=6\n  Turn18: S -> turn19: y=6\nThen at turn19: U -> turn20: y=7\nTurn20: U -> turn21: y=8\nTurn21: U -> turn22: y=9\n\nSo total turns: from turn10 to turn22? That is 13 actions? But we started at turn10 and the last action is at turn21? Then we are at y=9 at turn22.\n\nBut we are to output actions from turn10 to the last action that makes us reach y=9 at the next state. So we need to do actions at turn10,11,...,21? That's 12 actions.\n\nBut we can do better? \n\nAlternatively, we can go faster to y=6 and then wait less? But we can get to y=6 at turn15. The next safe time for freeway7 is turn19 (if we want to go to freeway7 at turn19 and then freeway8 at turn20) but we have to be at freeway7 at a safe time: actually we can be at freeway7 at turn19? But note: we can only move one per turn. \n\nBut wait: we can go to freeway7 at turn19? How? \n  We must be at y=6 at turn18? Then at turn18 we do U and then at turn19 we are at y=7? \n  But turn19: freeway7 is safe? Yes, as computed.\n\nBut then we can avoid waiting 4 turns? \n\nWe can get to y=6 at turn15. Then we can wait only 3 turns? \n  Turn15: at y=6 -> we can do S at turn15 -> turn16: y=6\n  Turn16: S -> turn17: y=6\n  Turn17: S -> turn18: y=6\n  Turn18: U -> turn19: y=7 (safe)\n\nThen:\n  Turn19: U -> turn20: y=8 (but at turn20: freeway8: t=10 -> [1,12] -> safe? Actually, we computed [1,12] which does not include 0 -> safe.\n  Turn20: U -> turn21: y=9.\n\nSo that's 11 actions? \n\nBut wait: we started at turn10. The actions:\n\n  Turn10: U -> y=2 at turn11\n  Turn11: U -> y=3 at turn12\n  Turn12: U -> y=4 at turn13\n  Turn13: U -> y=5 at turn14\n  Turn14: U -> y=6 at turn15\n  Turn15: S -> y=6 at turn16\n  Turn16: S -> y=6 at turn17\n  Turn17: S -> y=6 at turn18\n  Turn18: U -> y=7 at turn19\n  Turn19: U -> y=8 at turn20\n  Turn20: U -> y=9 at turn21\n\nSo we do 11 actions? But we need to count the actions: from turn10 to turn20? That's 11 actions? \n  Turn10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20 -> 11 actions.\n\nBut we reach y=9 at turn21. So H=11.\n\nCan we do with 10? \n\nWe need to get to freeway7 at a safe time that is at most turn19? But we can try to get to freeway7 at turn15? But turn15: t=5 -> freeway7: \n  Car1: [-35+4*5, -24+4*5] = [-35+20, -24+20] = [-15,-4] -> does not include 0 -> safe? \n  Car2: [29+20,40+20] = [49,60] -> safe.\n\nOh! I missed that. The dangerous times for freeway7 are only t=6,7,8? So t=5 (turn15) is safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway8: at turn15: t=5 -> \n  [-29+3*5, -18+3*5] = [-29+15, -18+15] = [-14,-3] -> safe.\n\nSo we can be at freeway7 at turn15 and freeway8 at turn16? \n\nBut wait: at turn15: if we are at freeway7, then at turn16 we can go to freeway8. But freeway8 at turn16 is dangerous? Yes, because at turn16: t=6 -> freeway8: [-29+18, -18+18] = [-11,0] -> includes 0 -> dangerous.\n\nSo we cannot be at freeway8 at turn16.\n\nBut we can be at freeway7 at turn15 (safe) and then wait at freeway7 until a safe time to go to freeway8? \n\nFreeway7: at turn16: dangerous -> so we cannot stay at freeway7 at turn16. \n\nSo if we are at freeway7 at turn15, we must leave at turn15? But we can only move to y=6 or y=8? \n\nBut if we move to y=8 at turn16? Then at turn16 we are on freeway8 -> dangerous.\n\nAlternatively, we can move down? But that would be counterproductive.\n\nSo the only safe option from freeway7 at turn15 is to go to y=6? But then we are going down? Then we have to come back? That would take more moves.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\n  Get to freeway7 at turn15 (safe) -> then at turn15 we do D? Then at turn16 we are at y=6? \n  Then we wait at y=6 until we can go up again? But that would be the same as before.\n\nBut we can then go up at a later time? \n\nAlternatively, we can get to freeway7 at a safe time that is not turn15,16,17,18? We saw turn19 is safe.\n\nBut we can also get to freeway7 at turn19? \n\nBut we can get to freeway7 earlier? \n\nWhat if we delay our ascent? We don't have to go up as fast as possible.\n\nWe can get to y=6 at a later time? \n\nBut we start at y=1. We can do some stays at lower freeways? \n\nFor example, we can wait at y=1 for a few turns? \n\nBut that would only delay and we have to avoid freeway7 and freeway8 during the dangerous period.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to get to freeway8 after turn19? \n\nBut note: the dangerous period for freeway8 ends at turn19? Actually, at turn19: t=9 -> freeway8: [-29+27, -18+27] = [-2,9] -> includes 0 -> dangerous. So we must avoid turn19 as well. The next safe time is turn20: [1,12] -> safe.\n\nSo we need to be at freeway8 at turn20 or later? \n\nBut we can be at freeway8 at turn20: safe.\n\nThen we can do:\n\n  Plan: be at freeway7 at turn19? Then at turn19 we are at freeway7 -> safe. Then at turn19 we do U -> turn20: at freeway8 -> safe. Then turn20: U -> turn21: at9.\n\nHow to get to freeway7 at turn19? \n\nWe must be at y=6 at turn18? Then at turn18 we do U -> turn19: y=7.\n\nBut we can be at y=6 at turn18? \n\nWe start at y=1 at turn10. We need to go from 1 to 6: that takes 5 moves. So we can get to y=6 at turn15 (if we do 5 U in a row). Then we can wait at y=6 for 3 turns (turns15,16,17) and then at turn18 we do U to go to y=7 at turn19.\n\nBut we can also get to y=6 at a later time? For example, we can do some stays at lower levels to avoid having to wait at y=6? \n\nBut that would not save time? Because if we wait at a lower level, we still have to wait the same amount of time? Actually, we can only go one step per turn.\n\nThe minimal time to get from y=1 to y=6 is 5 turns (5 moves). Then we have to wait at y=6 until turn18? Then at turn18 we move to y=7 (arrive at turn19). Then at turn19 we move to y=8 (arrive at turn20), then at turn20 we move to y=9 (arrive at turn21).\n\nTotal turns: 11 actions? \n\nBut we can avoid the long wait at y=6 by waiting at a lower freeway? \n\nHowever, we have to pass through the dangerous freeways at safe times. The dangerous periods are fixed. \n\nAlternatively, we can go to freeway7 at turn15 (which is safe) and then at turn15 we move to y=6? Then we are at y=6 at turn16. Then we wait at y=6 until we can go up? \n\nBut then we are at y=6 at turn16,17,18? Then at turn18 we go to y=7 at turn19? Same as above.\n\nBut we cannot stay at freeway7 at turn16? So we have to leave. \n\nSo the above plan of waiting at y=6 for 3 turns (turns15,16,17) and then going up at turn18 is valid.\n\nBut can we do with 10 actions? \n\nWe need to get to y=9 at turn20? Then we would have done 10 actions: from turn10 to turn19? Then at turn20 we are at y=9.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at turn20, we must have been at y=8 at turn19. And at turn19 we are on freeway8? But freeway8 at turn19 (t=9) is dangerous: [-2,9] includes 0. So we cannot be at freeway8 at turn19.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid freeway8 at turn19. The next safe time is turn20? So we can be at freeway8 at turn20? Then we can do:\n\n  turn19: at y=8? But how? We must have been at y=7 at turn18? Then at turn18 we do U -> turn19: y=8? But then at turn19 we are at freeway8 -> dangerous.\n\nAlternatively, we can be at y=8 at turn20? Then we do U at turn20 to get to y=9 at turn21? But then we are at y=9 at turn21.\n\nTo be at y=8 at turn20, we must have been at y=7 at turn19? Then at turn19 we do U -> turn20: y=8.\n\nBut then we need to be at y=7 at turn19? Which is safe (freeway7 at turn19: t=9 -> safe as above).\n\nSo the plan:\n\n  Be at y=6 at turn18? Then at turn18: do U -> turn19: y=7 (safe) \n  Then at turn19: do U -> turn20: y=8 (freeway8: t=10 -> safe) \n  Then at turn20: do U -> turn21: y=9.\n\nSo we are at y=9 at turn21.\n\nHow to be at y=6 at turn18? \n  We start at y=1 at turn10. We have 8 turns to go from 1 to 6? That's 5 moves up and 3 stays? \n\nWe can do:\n\n  Turn10: U -> y=2 at turn11\n  Turn11: U -> y=3 at turn12\n  Turn12: U -> y=4 at turn13\n  Turn13: U -> y=5 at turn14\n  Turn14: U -> y=6 at turn15\n  Then we wait at y=6: \n        Turn15: S -> y=6 at turn16\n        Turn16: S -> y=6 at turn17\n        Turn17: S -> y=6 at turn18\n  Then turn18: U -> y=7 at turn19\n  Turn19: U -> y=8 at turn20\n  Turn20: U -> y=9 at turn21\n\nThat's 10 moves? But the actions are at turn10 to turn20? That's 11 actions? \n  Count: turn10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20 -> 11 actions.\n\nBut note: we are at y=6 at turn15. Then we do three S: at turn15,16,17 -> that's three actions. Then turn18: U, turn19: U, turn20: U.\n\nTotal actions: 5 (to get to y=6) + 3 (wait) + 3 (to go from y=6 to y=9) = 11.\n\nBut we can save one action by not waiting as long? \n\nWe can get to y=6 later? \n\nFor example, we can do:\n\n  Turn10: S -> stay at y=1 (but we are at freeway1: safe at all times) -> then at turn11: y=1\n  Turn11: U -> y=2 at turn12\n  Turn12: U -> y=3 at turn13\n  Turn13: U -> y=4 at turn14\n  Turn14: U -> y=5 at turn15\n  Turn15: U -> y=6 at turn16\n  Then we wait at y=6 for two turns: \n        Turn16: S -> y=6 at turn17\n        Turn17: S -> y=6 at turn18\n  Then turn18: U -> y=7 at turn19\n  Turn19: U -> y=8 at turn20\n  Turn20: U -> y=9 at turn21\n\nThat's still 11 actions: turn10 to turn20.\n\nBut we did one extra stay at the beginning. \n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n  Turn10: U -> y=2 at turn11\n  Turn11: S -> y=2 at turn12\n  Turn12: U -> y=3 at turn13\n  etc.\n\nBut that doesn't reduce the total.\n\nCan we avoid one of the waits? \n\nWe need to be at y=7 at turn19. We can be at y=7 at turn19 if we were at y=6 at turn18. \n\nWe can be at y=6 at turn18 by:\n\n  Starting at y=1 at turn10, we need to go up 5 steps. We have 8 turns (turn10 to turn17) to do 5 moves and 3 stays? That's 8 turns? \n\nBut we have to be at y=6 at turn18? So at the end of turn17 we must be at y=6? \n\nAt turn10: y=1\nAfter action at turn10: at turn11: y=?\n...\nAt turn17: we are at y? \n\nWe need to have y_18 = 6? But y_18 is determined by the action at turn17: \n  y_{18} = y_{17} + a_{17}\n\nBut we want y_{18} = 6? So we can be at y_{17}=5 and then do U at turn17? Then at turn18: y=6.\n\nOr at y_{17}=6 and do S? Then at turn18: y=6.\n\nBut we want to be at y=6 at turn18? So we can be at y=6 at turn17 and then do S at turn17? Then turn18: y=6.\n\nOr we can be at y=5 at turn17 and do U at turn17 to get to y=6 at turn18.\n\nSo we can get to y=6 at turn18 by having 5 moves in the 8 turns (from turn10 to turn17). That leaves 3 stays.\n\nBut we can distribute the stays arbitrarily. \n\nThe minimal H is 11? Because we need to cover 8 steps (from 1 to 9) and we have to wait 3 times? So 8 moves? But we have 3 stays, so total actions: 8 moves? But we have 5 moves to get to 6 and then 3 moves to go from 6 to 9? That's 8 moves? And 3 stays? Total 11 actions? \n\nBut note: the moves are the actions. The goal is to minimize the number of actions (H) until the last action that gets us to 9.\n\nWe have to do 8 moves (U) and 3 stays? That's 11 actions.\n\nBut is there a way without the 3 stays? \n\nWe can avoid the dangerous freeways by timing differently? \n\nFor example, we can go from y=6 to y=7 at turn15 (safe) and then from y=7 to y=8 at turn20? \n\nBut at turn15: we are at y=7? Then we have to wait at y=7 until turn20? But freeway7 is dangerous at turn16,17,18? So we cannot stay at y=7 during those turns. We must leave. \n\nSo we can go down? \n\nAt turn15: at y=7 (safe) -> then at turn15 we do D? Then at turn16 we are at y=6? Then we wait at y=6 until we can go up? Then at turn19 we go to y=7? Then to y=8 and y=9? \n\nBut then we did an extra move (down and then up again) so that would be more actions.\n\nAlternatively, we can go from y=7 to y=8 at a safe time? The next safe time for freeway8 is turn20? So at turn19 we can be at y=7? Then at turn19 we do U -> turn20: y=8? Then at turn20: freeway8 is safe? Then at turn20 we do U -> turn21: y=9.\n\nBut how to be at y=7 at turn19? \n\nWe can go from y=1 to y=7 in 6 moves? Then we can do:\n\n  Turn10: U -> y=2\n  Turn11: U -> y=3\n  Turn12: U -> y=4\n  Turn13: U -> y=5\n  Turn14: U -> y=6\n  Turn15: U -> y=7   [at turn16: we are at y=7 -> but turn16 is dangerous for freeway7 -> collision]\n\nSo we cannot do that.\n\nWe can wait at lower freeways? \n\nFor example, we do:\n\n  Turn10: U -> y=2 at turn11\n  Turn11: S -> y=2 at turn12\n  Turn12: U -> y=3 at turn13\n  Turn13: U -> y=4 at turn14\n  Turn14: U -> y=5 at turn15\n  Turn15: U -> y=6 at turn16\n  Then we need to get to y=7 at turn19? \n        At turn16: we are at y=6 -> we can do U? Then at turn17: y=7 -> but freeway7 at turn17: dangerous -> collision.\n\nSo we must not go to y=7 until turn19? \n\nSo we can only get to y=7 at turn19 by being at y=6 at turn18? \n\nTherefore, the minimal number of actions is 11.\n\nBut let me confirm the entire sequence:\n\nTurn10: U -> at turn11: y=2 (freeway2: safe? t=1 -> safe)\nTurn11: U -> turn12: y=3 (freeway3: safe)\nTurn12: U -> turn13: y=4 (freeway4: safe? t=3>=1 -> safe)\nTurn13: U -> turn14: y=5 (freeway5: safe)\nTurn14: U -> turn15: y=6 (freeway6: safe)\nTurn15: S -> turn16: y=6 (freeway6: safe)\nTurn16: S -> turn17: y=6 (freeway6: safe)\nTurn17: S -> turn18: y=6 (freeway6: safe)\nTurn18: U -> turn19: y=7 (freeway7: t=9 -> safe: as computed [1,12] and [65,76] -> no 0)\nTurn19: U -> turn20: y=8 (freeway8: t=10 -> [1,12] -> safe)\nTurn20: U -> turn21: y=9 -> goal.\n\nWe did 11 actions: from turn10 to turn20.\n\nIs there a way with 10 actions? \n\nSuppose we do 10 actions: then we would be at y=9 at turn20? That means at turn19 we did the last U? Then at turn20 we are at y=9.\n\nSo at turn19 we are at y=8? Then we do U at turn19 to get to y=9 at turn20.\n\nBut at turn19 we are at freeway8? And freeway8 at turn19 (t=9) is dangerous: [-2,9] includes 0 -> collision.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at freeway8 at turn19.\n\nSo the minimal H is 11.\n\nBut note: we could be at freeway8 at turn20? Then we do U at turn20 to get to y=9 at turn21. Then we only need to be at y=8 at turn20? \n\nTo be at y=8 at turn20, we must have been at y=7 at turn19? Then at turn19 we do U -> turn20: y=8.\n\nBut then we need to be at y=7 at turn19? Which is safe (as above). \n\nSo the sequence for 10 actions? \n\nBut wait: we are to output 10 actions? Then we would do actions at turn10 to turn19? Then at turn20 we are at y=8? Then we haven't reached y=9? \n\nWe must reach y=9 at the state after the last action. So the last action should be at turn20? Then we are at y=9 at turn21? \n\nTherefore, we must do 11 actions.\n\nAlternatively, if we can get to y=9 at turn20? Then we must do the last action at turn19? But that would require that at turn19 we are at y=8 and then we do U and at turn20 we are at y=9. But we cannot be at y=8 at turn19 because freeway8 is dangerous.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\nSo we output 11 actions.\n\nBut note: we can try to wait at a lower freeway to reduce the waiting time at y=6? \n\nFor example, if we wait at y=1 for one turn, then we can get to y=6 at turn16? Then we only need to wait at y=6 for 2 turns? \n\nBut then:\n\n  Turn10: S -> y=1 at turn11\n  Turn11: U -> y=2 at turn12\n  Turn12: U -> y=3 at turn13\n  Turn13: U -> y=4 at turn14\n  Turn14: U -> y=5 at turn15\n  Turn15: U -> y=6 at turn16\n  Turn16: S -> y=6 at turn17\n  Turn17: S -> y=6 at turn18\n  Turn18: U -> y=7 at turn19\n  Turn19: U -> y=8 at turn20\n  Turn20: U -> y=9 at turn21\n\nThat's still 11 actions: from turn10 to turn20.\n\nSame.\n\nBut we can save one wait if we can be at y=6 at turn18 without having to do the three waits? \n\nWe can do:\n\n  Turn10: U -> y=2\n  Turn11: U -> y=3\n  Turn12: U -> y=4\n  Turn13: U -> y=5\n  Turn14: S -> y=5   (wait at y=5)\n  Turn15: U -> y=6   (at turn16: y=6)\n  Then we need to be at y=6 at turn18? So we do:\n        Turn16: S -> y=6 at turn17\n        Turn17: S -> y=6 at turn18\n        Turn18: U -> y=7 at turn19\n        Turn19: U -> y=8 at turn20\n        Turn20: U -> y=9 at turn21\n\nStill 11 actions.\n\nBut we did one wait at y=5 and two at y=6? \n\nTotal waits: 3.\n\nSo we cannot avoid 3 waits? \n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\nSo we output the sequence:\n\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: U\nTurn12: U\nTurn13: U\nTurn14: U\nTurn15: S\nTurn16: S\nTurn17: S\nTurn18: U\nTurn19: U\nTurn20: U\n\nBut let me double-check the freeways at each step:\n\nAt turn10: action U -> then at turn11: y=2 (freeway2). \n  Turn11: t=1 (since T=11, t=1) -> freeway2: safe (as we determined freeway2 safe for t>=1) -> safe.\n\nAt turn11: action U -> turn12: y=3 (freeway3): t=2 -> safe.\n\nAt turn12: action U -> turn13: y=4 (freeway4): t=3 -> safe (because freeway4 safe for t>=1).\n\nAt turn13: action U -> turn14: y=5 (freeway5): t=4 -> safe.\n\nAt turn14: action U -> turn15: y=6 (freeway6): safe.\n\nAt turn15: action S -> turn16: y=6 (freeway6): safe.\n\nAt turn16: action S -> turn17: y=6 (freeway6): safe.\n\nAt turn17: action S -> turn18: y=6 (freeway6): safe.\n\nAt turn18: action U -> turn19: y=7 (freeway7): t=9 -> \n  Car1: [-35+4*9, -24+4*9] = [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12] -> no 0.\n  Car2: [29+36,40+36]=[65,76] -> no 0.\n  Safe.\n\nAt turn19: action U -> turn20: y=8 (freeway8): t=10 -> \n  [-29+3*10, -18+3*10] = [1,12] -> no 0 -> safe.\n\nAt turn20: action U -> turn21: y=9 -> goal.\n\nPerfect.\n\nSo the answer is 11 actions.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". Here H=11.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: S\nTurn 16: S\nTurn 17: S\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\n}\n\nBut note: the current turn is t1=10, and we start at (0,1). The first action is at turn10.\n\nWe output from turn10 to turn20 (11 actions) and then at turn21 we are at (0,9).\n\nSo this is the solution.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 10\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) by strategically moving up and waiting at safe positions during dangerous turns.\n\n- The dangerous periods for freeway 7 are turns 16, 17, and 18 (relative to \\(t_1 = 10\\), corresponding to \\(t = 6, 7, 8\\)).\n- The dangerous periods for freeway 8 are turns 16, 17, 18, and 19 (relative to \\(t_1 = 10\\), corresponding to \\(t = 6, 7, 8, 9\\)).\n\nThe sequence ensures:\n- Movement from \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 6\\) in 5 turns (turns 10 to 14) using \"U\" actions, avoiding collisions as freeways 1 to 6 are safe during these turns.\n- Waiting at \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6, which is always safe) for 3 turns (turns 15 to 17) using \"S\" actions to avoid the dangerous periods on freeways 7 and 8.\n- Moving from \\(y = 6\\) to \\(y = 9\\) in 3 turns (turns 18 to 20) using \"U\" actions, reaching freeway 7 at turn 19 (\\(t = 9\\), safe) and freeway 8 at turn 20 (\\(t = 10\\), safe).\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: S\nTurn 16: S\nTurn 17: S\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0, 2) at turn t_1 = 11. I need to get to (0, 9) in the fewest turns possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The vertical position y must be between 0 and 9.\n\nThe player moves based on actions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), or S (stay, y same). y must stay within bounds, so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nNow, about the cars: for each freeway (y=1 to 8), there are cars with positions given at turn t_1=11. The positions are given as head and tail, and they move left or right with a constant speed.\n\nCollision happens if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that y, there is a car such that 0 is within its span at that exact turn T. The span is the interval covered by the car.\n\nImportantly, when you move to a new y, you are not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, you are on y_T, and if you move to y_{T+1}, you arrive there at turn T+1. So for collision, at turn T, we only care about cars on y_T at that turn.\n\nThe car positions are given at t_1=11, and I need to find where they are at future turns relative to t_1.\n\nLet me denote Δt = T - t_1, so at time T, which is Δt turns after t_1.\n\nFor a car with initial head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s:\n\n- If left-moving (d = left), span at T is [h - s * Δt, τ - s * Δt]\n\n- If right-moving (d = right), span at T is [τ + s * Δt, h + s * Δt]\n\nIn the right-moving case, for example, at t_1, span is [τ, h] with τ < h, and it moves right, so at T, it's [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt].\n\nSimilarly for left: at t_1, [h, τ] with h > τ (since left-moving, head is left of tail? I need to be careful with the notation.\n\nLook at the car update:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the input, for left-moving cars, h and τ are given, and for example, freeway 4: (-60, -25, left, 36), so h = -60, τ = -25, and since left-moving, at t_1, span is [h, τ] = [-60, -25].\n\nThen at T, it's [h - s*Δt, τ - s*Δt] = [-60 -36*Δt, -25 -36*Δt]\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, like freeway 1: (96,49, right,48), span at t_1 is [τ, h]? No, the input says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\", and for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h], but in the example, freeway 1: (96,49, right,48), so h=96, τ=49, and since right-moving, span should be from smaller to larger, so [49,96] I think? But it says [τ, h] = [49,96], which is correct, τ=49, h=96.\n\nIn the text: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly for left: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ]\" with h > τ.\n\nIn freeway 4, left: (-60,-25), h=-60, τ=-25, so h < τ? -60 < -25, but if it's left-moving, and span [h,τ] = [-60,-25], which means from x=-60 to x=-25, so if it's moving left, decreasing x, head at -60, tail at -25, so when moving left, head is at left (more negative), tail at right (less negative), so [h,τ] with h < τ for left-moving? I'm confused.\n\nLet's clarify the coordinate system.\n\nAssume x-axis horizontal, with x=0 being the player's path.\n\nFor left-moving cars: direction left, meaning decreasing x. At t_1, span is given as [h, τ], and since moving left, at T, [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt]. In freeway 4: (-60,-25, left,36), so at t_1, span [-60,-25]. If moving left, after Δt, it should be at [-60 -36Δt, -25 -36Δt], so the whole car shifts left by sΔt each turn.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: increasing x. Freeway 1: (96,49, right,48), span at t_1 [49,96]? But input says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so τ=49, h=96, so [49,96], which is from 49 to 96, moving right.\n\nAt T, [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt] = [49 +48Δt, 96 +48Δt].\n\nIn general, the span is an interval, and we care if 0 is in that interval at turn T for the freeway the player is on.\n\nNow, collision occurs only if at turn T, y_T is between 1 and 8, and for that freeway, there is a car with 0 in its span at T.\n\nIf y_T = 0 or 9, no freeway, so no collision possible. y=0 and y=9 are safe, I think, as per the vertical axis y=0,1,2,...,9, and freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, so safe.\n\nThe player starts at y=2, which is freeway 2? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=2 is freeway 2.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nSince we need min turns, probably best to go up as much as possible, but avoiding collisions.\n\ny from 2 to 9, difference of 7, so min turns if we go up every turn is 7 turns, but we might need to wait or go down sometimes to avoid cars.\n\nBut going down might increase turns, so we should avoid unnecessary downs.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their positions over time relative to t_1=11.\n\nSet t_1 = 11, so for turn T, Δt = T - 11.\n\nWe need to find actions from turn 11 onwards.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, so at turn t_1, we take action a_{t_1}, which determines y_{t_1+1}, and so on, up to a_{t_1 + H-1} which gets us to y_{t_1 + H-1} = 9.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T, and we take action a_T to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nCollision checked at each turn T based on y_T and cars on that y at turn T.\n\nStart at T=11, y_11 = 2.\n\nWe need to find actions a_11, a_12, ..., up to when we reach y=9.\n\nFirst, let's model the car positions for each freeway and each future turn.\n\nSince the cars move continuously, but we only care about when 0 is in the span for a given freeway at turn T.\n\nFor each freeway k (y=k), and for each turn T, we can compute if there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in its span at T.\n\nIf so, that position is occupied at turn T, and player cannot be on y=k at turn T.\n\nOtherwise, it's safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are always safe.\n\nNow, for each freeway, let's list the cars:\n\nFreeway 1: y=1\n\nCars: (96,49, right,48)  // only one car? Input says \"Cars\", and it's listed as (96,49,right,48), so one car.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: (60,49,right,12), (12,1,right,12)  // two cars\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? (60,49,right,12), (12,1,right,12)\n\nFreeway 4: (-60,-25,left,36)  // one car\n\nFreeway 5: same, (-60,-25,left,36)\n\nFreeway 6: (18,7,right,6)  // one car\n\nFreeway 7: (-20,-31,right,4), (44,33,right,4)  // two cars? (-20,-31,right,4) and (44,33,right,4)\n\nFreeway 8: (-15,-26,right,3)  // one car\n\nNow, for each, we need the span at turn T.\n\nDefine Δt = T - 11.\n\nFor freeway 1 (y=1):\n\nCar: right, s=48, initial span at T=11: [τ, h] = [49,96] since τ=49, h=96\n\nAt T, span: [49 + 48*Δt, 96 + 48*Δt]\n\n0 in span if 49 +48Δt <= 0 <= 96 +48Δt\n\nBut since 49>0, and moving right, 49+48Δt >0 for all Δt>=0, so 0 is never in this span because left end is at least 49>0. So for freeway 1, no car ever at x=0? 49 +48*Δt >=49 >0, so min x is 49, which is >0, so 0 is never in [49+48Δt, 96+48Δt] since both ends positive and increasing. So freeway 1 is always safe? Let me confirm.\n\nAt Δt=0, [49,96], 0 not in. As Δt increases, min x increases, so 0 always left of the car, never occupied. So y=1 is always safe to be on at any turn.\n\nIs that right? 49 +48Δt, for Δt=0, 49>0, so yes, 0 not in interval. So freeway 1 has no car that covers x=0 at any time. So y=1 is always free of collision.\n\nBut let's check the cars: only one car, and it's always to the right of 0. So yes.\n\nNow freeway 2 (y=2): two cars\n\nFirst car: (60,49,right,12), initial [49,60]? Head h=60, tail τ=49, direction right, so span at t1: [τ,h] = [49,60]\n\nAt T: [49 +12Δt, 60 +12Δt]\n\n0 in span? 49+12Δt <=0 <=60+12Δt? Since 49>0, min is 49+12Δt >=49>0, so 0 not in, always.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,12), h=12, τ=1, span at t1: [τ,h] = [1,12]\n\nAt T: [1 +12Δt, 12 +12Δt]\n\n0 in span? 1+12Δt <=0 <=12+12Δt? 1+12Δt >=1>0 for Δt>=0, so min x=1>0, so 0 not in interval. So both cars are always to the right of 0, never cover x=0. So freeway 2 is also always safe?\n\nBut at Δt=0, for second car, [1,12], 0 not in. Yes.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2, cars (60,49,right,12) and (12,1,right,12), both spans min x=49 and 1, both >0, so always safe.\n\nFreeway 4 (y=4): one car, left-moving: (-60,-25,left,36)\n\nInitial span: [h,τ] = [-60,-25]  // since left, h=-60, τ=-25, h<τ? -60<-25, so [h,τ] = [-60,-25] meaning from -60 to -25.\n\nAt T: [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt] = [-60 -36Δt, -25 -36Δt]\n\n0 in span if -60-36Δt <= 0 <= -25-36Δt\n\nSince the car is moving left, x decreasing.\n\nLeft end: -60-36Δt, right end: -25-36Δt.\n\nFor 0 to be in, we need left <=0 and 0<= right, so -60-36Δt <=0 and 0<= -25-36Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -60-36Δt <=0 => -36Δt <=60 => multiply by -1 (reverse inequality): 36Δt >= -60, which is always true since Δt>=0.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -25 -36Δt? This is 0 <= negative number, which is never true because -25-36Δt <0 for all Δt>=0.\n\nSo 0 <= -25-36Δt is false for all Δt. Therefore, 0 is never in the span. The car is always left of 0, since right end is -25-36Δt <= -25 <0. So x=0 is never occupied on freeway 4.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: same car, (-60,-25,left,36), same thing, always left of 0, so safe.\n\nNow freeway 6 (y=6): car (18,7,right,6)\n\nh=18, τ=7, right, so span at t1: [τ,h] = [7,18]\n\nAt T: [7 +6Δt, 18 +6Δt]\n\n0 in span? 7+6Δt <=0 <=18+6Δt? min x=7+6Δt >=7>0, so never. So safe.\n\nFreeway 7 (y=7): two cars\n\nFirst: (-20,-31,right,4)  // head h=-20? tail τ=-31? direction right.\n\nSpan at t1: for right-moving, [τ,h] = [-31,-20]? τ=-31, h=-20, so [τ,h] = [-31,-20]\n\nSince right-moving, at T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-31 +4Δt, -20 +4Δt]\n\n0 in span if -31+4Δt <=0 <= -20+4Δt\n\nNow, this can be true for some Δt.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (44,33,right,4), τ=33, h=44? Head h=44, tail τ=33, so [τ,h] = [33,44]\n\nAt T: [33 +4Δt, 44 +4Δt], min x=33>0, so 0 not in, always safe.\n\nSo only the first car on freeway 7 can have 0 in span.\n\nFor freeway 7, first car: [ -31 +4Δt, -20 +4Δt ]\n\n0 in span if -31 +4Δt <= 0 <= -20 +4Δt\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\n-31 +4Δt <= 0 and 0 <= -20 +4Δt\n\nFirst: -31 +4Δt <=0 => 4Δt <=31 => Δt <= 31/4 = 7.75, so Δt <=7 since integer? Turns are discrete, Δt integer.\n\nSimilarly, second: 0 <= -20 +4Δt => 4Δt >=20 => Δt >=5\n\nSo both: Δt >=5 and Δt <=7\n\nFor Δt=5: [ -31+20, -20+20] = [-11,0], so 0 <=0 is true, so 0 in span.\n\n-31+4*5 = -31+20= -11, -20+20=0, so [ -11, 0], and 0 is included? Since it's a closed interval? The span is inclusive, I assume, since collision if 0 in span.\n\nIn the collision definition: \"if 0 ∈ Span(T)\", so inclusive.\n\nSo at Δt=5, span [-11,0], 0 is in.\n\nΔt=6: [-31+24, -20+24] = [-7,4], 0 in since -7<=0<=4.\n\nΔt=7: [-31+28, -20+28] = [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nΔt=8: [-31+32, -20+32] = [1,12], 0 not in since 1>0.\n\nSo for freeway 7, occupied (collision possible) at Δt=5,6,7, which correspond to turns T=11+5=16, T=17, T=18.\n\nΔt = T - 11, so T = 11 + Δt\n\nAt T=16,17,18, y=7 is occupied if player is there.\n\nOther turns, safe.\n\nNow freeway 8 (y=8): car (-15,-26,right,3)\n\nHead h=-15, tail τ=-26? Direction right.\n\nSpan at t1: [τ,h] = [-26,-15]\n\nAt T: [ -26 +3Δt, -15 +3Δt ]\n\n0 in span if -26 +3Δt <=0 <= -15 +3Δt\n\nWhich is:\n\n-26 +3Δt <=0 => 3Δt <=26 => Δt <= 26/3 ≈8.666, so Δt <=8\n\n0 <= -15 +3Δt => 3Δt >=15 => Δt >=5\n\nSo Δt from 5 to 8 inclusive.\n\nΔt=5: [-26+15, -15+15] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nΔt=6: [-26+18, -15+18] = [-8,3], 0 in\n\nΔt=7: [-26+21, -15+21] = [-5,6], 0 in\n\nΔt=8: [-26+24, -15+24] = [-2,9], 0 in\n\nΔt=9: [-26+27, -15+27] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo occupied at Δt=5,6,7,8 → T=16,17,18,19\n\nNow, for other freeways, we saw that y=1,2,3,4,5,6 are always safe, since no car covers x=0.\n\ny=1,2,3,4,5,6 all safe at all times.\n\ny=7 and y=8 have dangerous times.\n\ny=7 dangerous at T=16,17,18 (from above, Δt=5,6,7 → T=16,17,18)\n\nT=11 + Δt, Δt=5: T=16, Δt=6: T=17, Δt=7: T=18\n\nSimilarly y=8 dangerous at T=16,17,18,19 (Δt=5,6,7,8)\n\nPlayer starts at y=2 at T=11.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no freeway.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nSince min turns, we want to go up as much as possible.\n\nFrom y=2, we can go directly to y=9 in 7 up moves, but we might hit dangerous times on y=7 or y=8.\n\nBut y=7 and y=8 are only dangerous at specific turns.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at some turn, and we can arrive earlier by going up faster.\n\nSince y=1 to 6 are always safe, we can move through them quickly.\n\nThe dangerous part is y=7 and y=8.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=7 at T=16,17,18 or on y=8 at T=16,17,18,19.\n\nSince we start at T=11, y=2.\n\nIf we go up every turn:\n\nTurn T=11: y=2, action U? At T, we are at y_T, take action to go to y_{T+1}.\n\nAt turn T=11: position y_11=2.\n\nWe take action a_11, which determines y_12.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo, if we always go up:\n\nT=11: y=2, action U → y_12=3\n\nT=12: y=3, action U → y_13=4\n\nT=13: y=4, action U → y_14=5\n\nT=14: y=5, action U → y_15=6\n\nT=15: y=6, action U → y_16=7\n\nBut at T=16, if y=7, and T=16 is dangerous for y=7 (since occupied), so collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=7 at T=16, we collide.\n\nWe could go slower or change speed.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=7 at T=16,17,18.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nSince y=6 is safe always, we can stay there if needed.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nPossible to go directly or wait.\n\nMin H: since from y=2 to y=9, min 7 moves up, but might need to wait.\n\nFirst, let's see the earliest we can be at y=9.\n\nIf no cars, we could be at y=9 at T=11 +7 =18? Let's see:\n\nStart T=11, y=2\n\nAfter first action (at T=11), y_12 = y_11 + Δy, depending on a_11.\n\nAfter k actions, y_{11+k} = y_11 + sum of Δy up to k.\n\ny_11=2, we need y_T =9 for some T.\n\nThe turn when we reach y=9.\n\ny increases by at most 1 per turn, so min turns to reach y=9 is 7, at T=18.\n\nT=11: y=2\n\nIf always up:\n\na_11: U → y_12=3\n\na_12: U → y_13=4\n\na_13: U → y_14=5\n\na_14: U → y_15=6\n\na_15: U → y_16=7\n\na_16: U → y_17=8\n\na_17: U → y_18=9\n\nSo at T=18, y=9.\n\nBut at T=16, y=7, which is occupied (dangerous at T=16), so collision.\n\nSimilarly, at T=17, if we are on y=8, but in this sequence at T=17, y=8.\n\ny=8 dangerous at T=16,17,18,19.\n\nT=17 is dangerous for y=8.\n\nIn above, at T=17, y=8, and T=17 is in dangerous times for y=8 (Δt=6, T=17), so collision.\n\nAlso at T=16, y=7 collision.\n\nSo need to avoid.\n\nWe need to either delay reaching y=7 or skip the dangerous times.\n\nSince y=7 dangerous only at T=16,17,18, so if we are on y=7 before or after, safe.\n\nSimilarly for y=8, dangerous T=16 to 19.\n\nBut y=8 dangerous at T=16,17,18,19, which is from Δt=5 to 8, T=16 to 19.\n\nNow, T=15: Δt=4, for y=7, at T=15, Δt=4, span for y=7 car: [-31+4*4, -20+4*4] = [-31+16, -20+16] = [-15,-4], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8 at T=15, Δt=4, [ -26+3*4, -15+3*4] = [-26+12, -15+12] = [-14,-3], 0 not in, safe.\n\nT=20: for y=7, Δt=9, span [ -31+36, -20+36] = [5,16], 0 not in.\n\ny=8 at T=20, Δt=9, [ -26+27, -15+27] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo safe at T<=15 and T>=20 for y=7 and y=8? y=7 safe except T=16,17,18; y=8 safe except T=16,17,18,19.\n\nNow, we can be on y=7 only at T=15 or before, or T=19 or after.\n\nSimilarly for y=8, only at T=15 or before, or T=20 or after.\n\nT=15 is safe for both.\n\nT=20 safe for both.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, we need to pass through y=7 and y=8.\n\nPossible to go up to y=6 quickly, then wait, or go directly.\n\nSince min turns, we want to reach as soon as possible.\n\nEarliest possible: if we can be at y=9 at T=18, but in the direct path, we hit y=7 at T=16 and y=8 at T=17, both dangerous.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 during dangerous times.\n\nOne way: reach y=7 earlier, before T=16.\n\nFor example, at T=15, be on y=7.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nStart at T=11, y=2.\n\nTo be at y=7 at T=15.\n\ny_15=7.\n\nFrom y_11=2 to y_15=7, difference 5, so in 4 turns (from T=11 to T=15, actions at T=11,12,13,14 affect y_12 to y_15).\n\ny_t for t from 11 to 15.\n\ny_11=2\n\ny_12 = y_11 + a_11 action\n\n...\n\ny_15 = y_11 + sum of Δy from t=11 to 14 actions.\n\nNumber of actions to go from y_11 to y_15: 4 actions (at T=11,12,13,14) determine y_15.\n\ny_15 - y_11 = sum_{k=0}^{3} Δy_{11+k}  // since actions at t affect y_{t+1}\n\nLet’s clarify the indices.\n\nAt time T, position y_T.\n\nAction a_T taken at T determines Δy_T, which affects y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nSo y_{T+1} depends on a_T.\n\nSequence: for T from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, actions, and at the end, after H actions, we have y_{t_1 + H} =9? Let's see.\n\nStart at turn t_1, position y_{t_1}.\n\nAfter first action a_{t_1}, y_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}\n\nAfter second action a_{t_1 +1}, y_{t_1 +2} = y_{t_1 +1} + Δy_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, y_{t_1 + k} = y_{t_1} + sum_{i=0}^{k-1} Δy_{t_1 + i}\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9 for some H, after H actions.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H, position is y_{t_1 + H}, which should be 9.\n\nAnd we take actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, total H actions.\n\nIn the sequence, actions a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, and y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nNow, collision at each turn T from t_1 to t_1 + H -1? No, collision is checked at turn T when we are at position (0, y_T), for T from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, but when we reach y=9 at T= t_1 + H, we don't take action there, so we don't check collision at that turn? Let's see.\n\nWe need to avoid collision for all turns from start until we reach, but when we are at y=9, it's safe, and we stop.\n\nThe turns where we are on freeways: from T=t_1 to the turn before reaching y=9.\n\nFor example, if we reach y=9 at turn T, then at turn T, y_T=9, which is safe, no collision check needed for freeway, since not a freeway.\n\nAnd for previous turns, we need no collision.\n\nIn the sequence, for each turn T from t_1 to T_final, where y_{T_final} =9, we need that for all T in [t_1, T_final], if y_T between 1 and 8, no collision on that freeway at turn T.\n\nAt T_final, y_T=9, safe.\n\nActions taken at T from t_1 to T_final -1.\n\nBack to min H.\n\ny_{t_1} =2, y_{t_1 + H} =9, so the number of actions H must be at least 7, since we need to increase y by 7.\n\nMin H=7, reaching at T= t_1 + H =11 + H.\n\nFor H=7, T_final =11+7=18.\n\nNow, y must go from 2 to 9 in 7 steps, with y_{18}=9.\n\ny_{11}=2\n\ny_{12} = y_{11} + Δy_{11}\n\n...\n\ny_{18} = y_{11} + sum_{i=11}^{17} Δy_i\n\nBut since y_{18} =9, y_{11}=2, so sum of Δy from i=11 to 17 must be +7.\n\nEach Δy is -1,0, or +1, so to have sum +7 in 7 steps, all must be +1, so only possible with all U actions.\n\nBut in that case, y_T for T=11 to 17: y_11=2, y_12=3, y_13=4, y_14=5, y_15=6, y_16=7, y_17=8, y_18=9.\n\nNow, collision at T=16: y=7, which is dangerous (T=16)\n\nT=17: y=8, dangerous (T=17)\n\nSo collision.\n\nThus H=7 impossible.\n\nNext, H=8, reach at T=19.\n\ny_{19}=9.\n\nNow, from y_{11}=2 to y_{19}=9, increase by 7 in 8 steps, so sum of Δy from i=11 to 18 must be +7.\n\nSince 8 actions, sum +7, so we must have 7 U and 1 S, or 6 U and 2 other, but since we need net +7, and 8 actions, possibilities: 7 U and 1 S, or 7 U and 1 D but then net +6, not +7, so only 7 U and 1 S.\n\nThat is, we stay once somewhere.\n\nNow, y_T sequence: T from 11 to 19.\n\ny_11=2\n\nAfter actions, y_19=9.\n\nThe position at each turn.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=7 at T=16,17,18 and on y=8 at T=16,17,18,19.\n\nDangerous turns: for y=7: T=16,17,18\n\nFor y=8: T=16,17,18,19\n\nWe can be on other y safely.\n\nSince we have to have one stay, we can use that to avoid the dangerous times.\n\nPossible to be on y=7 at safe times, like T=15 or T=19.\n\nSimilarly for y=8 at T=15 or T=20.\n\nBut T=20 is later.\n\nFor H=8, T_final=19, so we are at y=9 at T=19, so we don't care about after.\n\nTurns we care: T=11 to 18 for positions, and collision at T=11 to 18, since at T=19, y=9 safe.\n\ny_T for T=11 to 18.\n\ny_19=9, but at T=19, we don't have action or position check? Position is at turn T, so for T=19, y_19=9, safe, and we don't need to check collision since not freeway.\n\nBut for the path, we need y_T for T=11 to 18 to be safe.\n\ny_18 must be 8 or something, since y_19 = y_18 + Δy_18, and y_19=9, so if Δy_18=U, y_18=8; if S, y_18=9 but y_19=9, but y_19 = y_18 + Δy_18, so if y_18=9, Δy_18 must be 0, but then y_19=9, but we are already at 9, but the position at T=18 is y_18=9, which is safe, and action at T=18 might be S or something, but we can reach earlier.\n\nBut in this case, for min H, we want to reach as soon as possible.\n\nWith H=8, T_final=19.\n\nNow, y_11=2\n\ny_19=9\n\nActions from T=11 to T=18, 8 actions, with 7 U and 1 S.\n\nThe stay can be at some point.\n\ny sequence: let's list possible y_T.\n\nSince we have one stay, the y values increase slower.\n\nFor example, if we stay at some y, then y_T might be the same for two turns.\n\nWe need to avoid:\n\n- On y=7 at T=16,17,18\n\n- On y=8 at T=16,17,18,19 but T=19 we are at y=9? y_19=9, so at T=19, not on y=8.\n\nT=19 y_19=9, safe.\n\nSo for T=16,17,18, we must not be on y=7 or y=8 if dangerous.\n\nBut y=7 dangerous T=16,17,18; y=8 dangerous T=16,17,18,19 but T=19 not issue.\n\nSo for T=16,17,18, we must not be on y=7 or y=8.\n\nBecause both are occupied at those times.\n\nNow, where can we be at T=16,17,18?\n\nWe can be on y=6, which is always safe, or y=9, but y=9 might not be reached yet.\n\nOr y=5,4,etc., all safe.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9 by T=19.\n\nSince we have one stay, we can be at y=6 for two turns, for example.\n\nThen we can avoid being on y=7 or y=8 during T=16-18.\n\nSpecifically, we need that for T=16,17,18, y_T not 7 and not 8.\n\nSo y_T must be <=6 or >=9 for T=16,17,18.\n\nBut since we are going up, and y_19=9, it might be that y_18=8 or 9, but at T=18, if y_18=8, it is dangerous (T=18 occupied for y=8).\n\nSimilarly, if y_18=9, safe.\n\nBut if y_18=8, and we go up to y_19=9, but at T=18, y=8 is dangerous.\n\nSo we must have y_18 not 8, so since y_19=9, y_18 must be 9 or 8, but if y_18=8, collision at T=18, so must have y_18=9, then Δy_18=0, so we stay at y=9 or something.\n\ny_18=9, then y_19= y_18 + Δy_18 =9 +0 =9, so action at T=18 is S, and we are at y=9 at T=18 and T=19.\n\nBut at T=18, y=9 safe.\n\nSimilarly, for earlier.\n\nNow, back to T=16,17,18 must not be 7 or 8.\n\nSo y_T <=6 or =9 for T=16,17,18.\n\nBut y=9 only possible later.\n\nNow, let's find a sequence.\n\nStart T=11, y=2, safe.\n\nWe need to reach high y quickly but avoid T=16-18 on 7 or 8.\n\nSince y=6 is safe, we can be on y=6 during T=16-18 if possible.\n\nBut we need to go up to 9.\n\nFirst, min time to reach y=6.\n\nFrom y=2, with all U: T=11 y=2, after U: T=12 y=3, T=13 y=4, T=14 y=5, T=15 y=6. So at T=15, y=6.\n\nThen from there.\n\nAt T=15, y=6, safe.\n\nNow, if we go up at T=15, y_16=7, but T=16 y=7 dangerous.\n\nIf we stay, y_16=6, then at T=16, y=6 safe.\n\nThen we can go up later.\n\nBut we have one stay to use.\n\nIn H=8, we have one S.\n\nSo possible to stay at y=6 at some point.\n\nFor example, at T=15, y=6, if we do S, then y_16=6, position at T=16 is y=6, safe.\n\nThen at T=16, we can do U, y_17=7, but T=17 y=7 dangerous? T=17 is dangerous for y=7.\n\ny_17=7, and T=17, dangerous.\n\nIf at T=16, after S at T=15, y_16=6, then at T=16, if we do U, y_17=7, then at T=17, y=7, which is dangerous (T=17 occupied).\n\nSimilarly, if we do nothing, but we need to go up.\n\nAfter T=16, y=6, we could stay again but we only have one S.\n\nWith one S, we can stay once.\n\nSo from T=15 y=6, if we do S at T=15, then y_16=6.\n\nThen at T=16, we must do something.\n\nIf U, y_17=7, but T=17 y=7 dangerous.\n\nIf S, but we can only one S? In this path, we used one S at T=15, but we can have another? No, in H=8, only one S, so we must have 7 U and one S, so we cannot have two stays.\n\nSo at T=16, we must do U or D, but D down, not good.\n\nSo likely U.\n\nThen y_17=7, collision at T=17.\n\nNot good.\n\nFrom T=15 y=6, instead of staying, go up to y=7 at T=16, but T=16 y=7 dangerous.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo we need to be on y=7 before T=16 or after T=18.\n\nT=15 is safe for y=7.\n\nSimilarly, T=19 safe.\n\nBut with H=8, T_final=19, we need to be at y=9 at T=19.\n\nSo if we can be at y=7 at T=15.\n\nThen from there to y=9 in 4 actions? y_15=7, y_19=9, need increase by 2, in 4 actions (T=15,16,17,18 actions).\n\nActions at T=15,16,17,18 determine y_16 to y_19.\n\ny_15=7\n\ny_19=9\n\nSo y_19 = y_15 + Δy_15 + Δy_16 + Δy_17 + Δy_18\n\nSet equal to 9, y_15=7, so Δy_15 + Δy_16 + Δy_17 + Δy_18 = 2\n\nWith four actions, each +1,0,-1, so possible with two U and two S, or other, but we need net +2.\n\nFor example, U,U,S,S or U,S,U,S etc.\n\nBut we have to avoid being on y=7 at T=16,17,18 and y=8 at T=16,17,18,19.\n\nBut at T=15, y=7, safe.\n\nNow, after action at T=15, y_16 = y_15 + Δy_15\n\nIf Δy_15 = U, then y_16=8, but at T=16, if y_16=8, dangerous (T=16 occupied for y=8)\n\nIf Δy_15 = S, y_16=7, then at T=16, y=7, dangerous.\n\nIf Δy_15 = D, y_16=6, but then we go down, not efficient.\n\nSo if at T=15 y=7, any action will move us to y_16=8,7, or6, but:\n\n- To y=8: at T=16, y=8 dangerous\n\n- To y=7: at T=16, y=7 dangerous\n\n- To y=6: safe at T=16, but then we are lower.\n\nThen from y=6, we need to go up to 9 in few turns.\n\nBut y_19=9, so from y_16=6, need to go to y_19=9, increase by 3 in 3 actions? Actions at T=16,17,18 affect y_17,y_18,y_19.\n\ny_16=6\n\ny_19 = y_16 + Δy_16 + Δy_17 + Δy_18 =9\n\nSo Δy_16 + Δy_17 + Δy_18 =3\n\nWith three actions, all must be U.\n\nSo y_17=7, y_18=8, y_19=9.\n\nBut at T=17, y=7 dangerous; T=18, y=8 dangerous.\n\nCollision.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf we stay at y=7 longer, but we can't because of the dangerous times.\n\nPerhaps be at y=7 at T=15, then go down to y=6 at T=16, but then we are at y=6 at T=16, safe, but then we need to go up later, but during T=17,18, we might be on y=7 or 8 when dangerous.\n\nFor example, from y_16=6, if we go U at T=16, y_17=7, collision at T=17.\n\nIf we stay at T=16, y_17=6, then at T=17, y=6 safe, then U at T=17, y_18=7, but T=18 y=7 dangerous? T=18 is dangerous for y=7? Yes, T=18 occupied.\n\ny=7 dangerous at T=16,17,18.\n\nT=18 still dangerous.\n\nIf at T=17, after y_17=6, we do U, y_18=7, T=18 y=7 dangerous.\n\nIf we do nothing, but we need to reach y=9.\n\nFrom y_17=6, if we do U at T=17, y_18=7, dangerous at T=18.\n\nIf we do D, worse.\n\nSo not possible to avoid if we go to y=7 during T=16-18.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nSo for H=8, it might be difficult to avoid.\n\nPerhaps reach y=7 later, after T=18.\n\nBut T=19 is safe for y=7, but we need to be at y=9 at T=19.\n\nIf we are at y=7 at T=19, but y_19=9, so not.\n\ny_19 must be 9.\n\nSo we need to pass through y=7 and y=8 before.\n\nT=19 y=9, so at T=18, y_18 must be such that with action, y_19=9, so y_18=8 or 9.\n\nIf y_18=8, then U to y_19=9, but at T=18, y=8 dangerous.\n\nIf y_18=9, then S to y_19=9, but at T=18, y=9 safe.\n\nSo we can have y_18=9.\n\nThen we need to reach y=9 by T=18 or earlier, but with H=8, T_final=19, so y_19=9, so if we reach at T=18, y_18=9, then we can do S at T=18 to stay, but the position at T=18 is y=9, safe.\n\nThen for T=16,17,18, we need y_T not 7 and not 8.\n\nAt T=18, y=9, not 7 or 8, good.\n\nAt T=16 and T=17, we need y not 7 and not 8.\n\nSo y_T <=6 or =9 for T=16,17.\n\nBut y=9 only at T=18 or later, so for T=16,17, y_T <=6.\n\nSimilarly, at T=18, y=9>6, but it's ok.\n\nNow, from start, we need to be at y<=6 at T=16 and T=17.\n\nSince we have to increase to 9 by T=19.\n\ny_11=2\n\ny_19=9\n\nWith 8 actions, 7U and 1S.\n\nThe stay must be used to keep y low during T=16,17.\n\nFor example, stay at some y<=6.\n\nNow, let's list the turns.\n\nT=11: y=2, safe, action a_11\n\ny_12 = y_11 + Δy_11\n\n...\n\nUp to y_19.\n\nWe need y_16 <=6 and y_17 <=6.\n\nThen y_18 and y_19=9.\n\nSince y_19=9, and y_17 <=6, then from y_17 to y_19, two actions, increase by at least 3? y_17 <=6, y_19=9, so y_19 - y_17 = Δy_17 + Δy_18 >=3.\n\nBut each Δy <=1, so Δy_17 + Δy_18 <=2, contradiction.\n\ny_19 = y_17 + Δy_17 + Δy_18\n\ny_19=9, y_17 <=6, so y_19 - y_17 = Δy_17 + Δy_18 >=3\n\nBut Δy <=1 each, so max increase 2 in two actions, so y_19 - y_17 <=2, but 9 - y_17 >=3 since y_17<=6, 9-6=3>2, impossible.\n\nThus, it is impossible to have y_17 <=6 and y_19=9 with only two actions in between.\n\ny_17 <=6, y_19=9, difference at least 3, but only two actions (at T=17 and T=18) determine y_18 and y_19 from y_17.\n\ny_18 = y_17 + Δy_17\n\ny_19 = y_18 + Δy_18 = y_17 + Δy_17 + Δy_18\n\nSo y_19 - y_17 = Δy_17 + Δy_18 <= 1+1 =2 <3, so impossible if y_17 <=6.\n\nTherefore, for H=8, it is impossible to avoid collision because we cannot have y_17 <=6 and reach y=9 at T=19.\n\nSimilarly, if we consider y_16 <=6, but y_17 might be higher.\n\nBut we need both y_16 <=6 and y_17 <=6 to avoid being on 7 or 8 at T=16 and T=17.\n\nThen from y_17 <=6 to y_19=9, impossible as above.\n\nIf we don't require both, but we need for each T, y_T not 7 and not 8 for T=16,17,18.\n\nAt T=18, if we have y_18=9, then it is not 7 or 8, good.\n\nFor T=16 and T=17, we need y_16 not 7 and not 8, and y_17 not 7 and not 8.\n\nSo y_16 <=6 or >=9, but >=9 not possible at T=16, so y_16 <=6\n\nSimilarly y_17 <=6 or >=9, so y_17 <=6\n\nThen we have y_16 <=6 and y_17 <=6.\n\nThen y_19=9, with y_17 <=6, so y_19 - y_17 >=3, but only two actions to increase, max +2, impossible.\n\nThus H=8 is impossible.\n\nNow, try H=9, reach at T=20.\n\ny_20=9.\n\nThen actions from T=11 to T=19, 9 actions.\n\ny_20 = y_11 + sum_{i=11}^{19} Δy_i =9, y_11=2, so sum Δy =7.\n\n9 actions, net +7, so we can have 7 U, 2 S, or 8 U and 1 D, etc., but min actions, we want min H, so we should avoid downs, so 7 U and 2 S.\n\nNow, T_final=20, so we care about positions from T=11 to T=19.\n\nAt T=20, y=9 safe.\n\nDangerous turns for freeways: T=16,17,18 for y=7; T=16,17,18,19 for y=8.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=7 at T=16,17,18 and on y=8 at T=16,17,18,19.\n\nSince T=19 is dangerous for y=8, and we might be on y=8 at T=19.\n\nBut with H=9, we can be on y=8 at safe times.\n\nFor example, T=15 safe for both, T=20 safe for both.\n\nSo possible to be on y=7 at T=15 or T=19,20.\n\nSimilarly for y=8 at T=15 or T=20.\n\nT=20 we are at y=9, so not on y=8.\n\nSo be on y=7 at T=15 or T=19.\n\nSimilarly for y=8 at T=15 or T=20, but T=20 not possible, so at T=15.\n\nNow, let's plan the sequence.\n\nFirst, we can reach y=6 quickly.\n\nFrom T=11 y=2:\n\nWith all U: T=11: y=2, a11=U → y12=3\n\nT=12: y=3, a12=U → y13=4\n\nT=13: y=4, a13=U → y14=5\n\nT=14: y=5, a14=U → y15=6\n\nSo at T=15, y=6, safe.\n\nNow, at T=15, y=6, we can go to y=7 at T=16, but T=16 y=7 dangerous.\n\nOr stay at y=6, y16=6.\n\nThen at T=16, y=6, safe.\n\nNow, from here, we need to go up to y=9.\n\nBut T=16,17,18 are dangerous for y=7 and y=8.\n\nWe can stay at y=6 during T=16 and T=17, for example.\n\nThen at T=18, go up.\n\nBut we have two S to use.\n\nFirst, at T=15, y=6, we can do S: a15=S, so y16=6.\n\nPosition at T=16: y=6, safe.\n\nThen at T=16, we can do S again: a16=S, so y17=6.\n\nPosition at T=17: y=6, safe.\n\nThen at T=17, we do U: a17=U, so y18=7.\n\nBut at T=18, position y=7, and T=18 is dangerous for y=7 (occupied), so collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt T=17, after y17=6, if we do U, y18=7, T=18 y=7 dangerous.\n\nWe need to be on y=7 only at safe times, like T=19.\n\nT=19 is safe for y=7.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at T=20 safe, but we need to be at y=9 at T=20.\n\nSo from T=15 y=6, we can stay until after the dangerous period.\n\nDangerous until T=18 for y=7, T=19 for y=8.\n\nT=19 is dangerous for y=8.\n\nBut at T=19, if we are on y=8, dangerous.\n\nSo we need to be on y=8 only at T=20 or before T=16.\n\nBut before T=16, we are at lower y.\n\nSo let's be at y=6 until T=18 or something.\n\nAt T=15 y=6\n\na15=S → y16=6, T=16 y=6 safe\n\na16=S → y17=6, T=17 y=6 safe\n\nNow at T=17, we need to go up, but if we do U, y18=7, T=18 y=7 dangerous.\n\nIf we do nothing, stay, y18=6, then later.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9 by T=20.\n\ny20=9.\n\nFrom y17=6, actions at T=17,18,19.\n\ny20 = y17 + Δy17 + Δy18 + Δy19 =9\n\nSo Δy17 + Δy18 + Δy19 =3\n\nAll must be U.\n\nSo y18=7, y19=8, y20=9.\n\nBut at T=18, y=7 dangerous; at T=19, y=8 dangerous (T=19 occupied for y=8).\n\nCollision.\n\nNot good.\n\nTo avoid, we can be on y=7 at T=19.\n\nT=19 is safe for y=7.\n\nSimilarly, on y=8 at T=20, but T=20 we are at y=9.\n\nSo let's aim to be at y=7 at T=19.\n\nThen from there to y=9 quickly.\n\nBut y19=7, then to y20=9, need two U, so y20=9.\n\nBut at T=19, y=7, safe.\n\nThen y20=9.\n\nBut we need to be at y=7 at T=19.\n\nNow, from start, to be at y=7 at T=19.\n\ny19=7.\n\ny11=2, so in 8 actions (from T=11 to T=18), we need to go from 2 to 7, increase by 5, with 8 actions, so we can have 5 U and 3 S, for example.\n\nThen at T=19, y=7, safe.\n\nThen a19=U, y20=8, but at T=20, y=8, and T=20 is safe for y=8? Earlier we said T=20 safe.\n\ny=8 dangerous only up to T=19, T=20 safe.\n\nThen a20=U? But H=9, actions to T=19, y20=9.\n\nLet's set.\n\nActions from T=11 to T=19 for 9 actions, y20=9.\n\nIf we want y19=7, then y20 = y19 + Δy19 =7 + Δy19 =9, so Δy19=2, impossible, Δy only -1,0,1.\n\ny20 = y19 + Δy19, so if y19=7, y20=7,8, or9.\n\nTo have y20=9, we need Δy19=U, so y20=8 if y19=7, not 9.\n\nIf y19=8, then U to y20=9.\n\nOr y19=9, S to y20=9.\n\nSo we cannot have y19=7 and y20=9 directly; we need to be at y=8 or 9 at T=19.\n\nTo be at y=8 at T=19, which is dangerous (T=19 occupied for y=8).\n\nOr at y=9 at T=19, safe.\n\nBut if at T=19 y=9, we are done, but with H=9, T_final=20, so y20=9, so if we reach at T=19, we can have y19=9, then a19=S to y20=9.\n\nAt T=19, y=9 safe.\n\nSo possible to reach at T=19 with y19=9.\n\nThen for H=9, we can reach at T=19 or T=20.\n\nMin H, so reach at T=19 if possible.\n\nWith H=9 actions, we can reach as early as T=19 if we have fewer stays.\n\ny20 = y11 + sum_{i=11}^{19} Δy_i =9\n\ny11=2, so sum_{i=11}^{19} Δy_i =7\n\n9 actions, each Δy in {-1,0,1}, sum=7, so minimum number of U is 7, with 2 S or 1 S and 1 D but D reduces, so better 7 U and 2 S for min turns, but we can have 8 U and 1 D, sum=7, or 7 U 2 S.\n\nTo reach early, with more U.\n\nMax increase per turn is 1, so from y11=2, earliest to y=9 is T=18 with all U, but we saw it's impossible due to cars.\n\nWith H=9 actions, we can reach at T=20 with y20=9.\n\nOr at T=19 with y19=9, which requires that after 8 actions, y19=9, so sum of first 8 Δy from i=11 to 18 must be 7, with 8 actions, so 7 U and 1 S, for example.\n\nThen at T=19, y19=9, then a19=S to y20=9, but we don't need to move, but the action is taken, but position is safe.\n\nBut for min H, reaching at T=19 is better than T=20.\n\nH is the number of actions, T_final = t_1 + H.\n\nIf we reach at T=19 with y19=9, that means after 8 actions (from T=11 to T=18), y19=9.\n\nThen we take a19 at T=19, but if y19=9, a19 can be S, and y20=9, but we are at y=9 at T=19, so we can stop, but the sequence requires actions up to when we reach, so if we reach at T=19 with y19=9, then we don't need action at T=19, so H=8 actions to reach at T=19.\n\nI think I confused the indices.\n\nDefine: after k actions, we are at turn t_1 + k.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at T=11, y11=2.\n\nAfter 1 action a11, at T=12, y12.\n\nAfter 2 actions, T=13, y13.\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions, at T= t_1 + H, y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nAnd we take H actions: a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1}.\n\nFor example, to be at y=9 at T=19, that means after H actions, T=11 + H =19, so H=8.\n\nSimilarly, at T=20, H=9.\n\nFor H=8, we saw it's impossible.\n\nFor H=9, T_final=20.\n\ny20=9.\n\nPositions from T=11 to T=19 to be safe.\n\nWe need to avoid y=7 at T=16,17,18; y=8 at T=16,17,18,19.\n\nT=19 y=8 dangerous.\n\nSo we must not be on y=8 at T=19.\n\nSimilarly, not on y=7 at T=16,17,18.\n\nNow, to be on y=8 at safe times, like T=15 or T=20.\n\nT=20 we are at y=9, so only T=15.\n\nSimilarly for y=7, at T=15 or T=19,20.\n\nT=20 not, so T=15 or T=19.\n\nT=19 is safe for y=7.\n\nSo possible to be on y=7 at T=19.\n\nThen from there to y=9.\n\nBut y19=7, then y20=9, so we need to go from 7 to 9 in one action, impossible.\n\ny20 = y19 + Δy19, so from y19, we can go to y20 = y19-1, y19, or y19+1.\n\nSo if y19=7, y20=6,7, or8.\n\nNot 9.\n\nTo reach y20=9, we need y19=8 or 9.\n\nIf y19=8, then U to y20=9.\n\nIf y19=9, S to y20=9.\n\nBut at T=19, if y19=8, it is dangerous (occupied).\n\nIf y19=9, safe.\n\nSo the only safe way to have y19=9.\n\nThen we are at y=9 at T=19, and we take a19 to have y20=9, so a19=S.\n\nBut at T=19, position is y=9, safe.\n\nFor earlier turns, we need to reach y=9 by T=19 with H=9 actions? If we reach at T=19, H=8 actions.\n\nBut H=8 is impossible as we saw.\n\nWith H=9, we reach at T=20.\n\nSo for H=9, T_final=20, y20=9.\n\ny19 must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y19=8, then at T=19, y=8 dangerous.\n\nIf y19=9, then at T=19, y=9 safe, and a19=S to y20=9.\n\nSo we can have y19=9.\n\nThen we need to reach y=9 at T=19 with the first 8 actions.\n\nBut to reach at T=19 with H=8 actions, which we concluded impossible due to cars.\n\nWith H=9, we can reach at T=19 or T=20.\n\nIf we reach at T=19 with y19=9, that requires only 8 actions, so for H=9, it would be redundant, but we can do it with H=8 if possible, but it's not, so for H=9, we must reach at T=20.\n\nSo y20=9, with y19=8 or 9.\n\nBut if y19=8, collision at T=19.\n\nSo must have y19=9, then a19=S, y20=9.\n\nBut at T=19, y=9 safe.\n\nSo for the path, we are at y=9 at T=19 and T=20.\n\nNow for the dangerous turns T=16,17,18, we need y_T not 7 and not 8.\n\nAt T=18, if we are at y=9, not 7 or 8, good.\n\nAt T=16 and T=17, we need y not 7 and not 8, so y_T <=6 or =9.\n\nSince T=16,17 early, y_T <=6.\n\nThen from y_17 <=6 to y_19=9.\n\ny19 = y17 + Δy17 + Δy18\n\ny19=9, y17<=6, so 9 - y17 >=3, but Δy17 + Δy18 <=2, impossible.\n\nSame problem as before.\n\ny19 = y17 + Δy17 + Δy18\n\nIf y17 <=6, then y19 <=6 +2=8 <9, cannot reach 9.\n\nContradiction.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to have y17 <=6 and y19=9.\n\nBut to avoid collision at T=17, we need y17 not 7 and not 8, so if y17 <=6, then for y19=9, impossible with two actions.\n\nIf y17=9, but at T=17, y=9, safe, but y17=9 means we reached early, which for H=9, T=17 is turn 11+6=17, after 6 actions, y17=9, but from y11=2 to y17=9, increase by 7 in 6 actions, possible only with all U, but then at T=16 y=8 or something, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo the only way is to have y17 not 7 and not 8, but if y17=9, it is not 7 or 8, so safe, but reaching y=9 at T=17 requires 6 actions, but with cars, it may not be possible without collision.\n\nBut in this case, from y11=2 to y17=9 in 6 actions: all U.\n\ny11=2, a11=U y12=3, a12=U y13=4, a13=U y14=5, a14=U y15=6, a15=U y16=7, a16=U y17=8, not 9.\n\nAfter 6 actions, at T=17, y17.\n\nAfter 0 actions: T=11 y11=2\n\nAfter 1 action: T=12 y12\n\nAfter 2: T=13 y13\n\n...\nAfter k actions: T=11+k y_{11+k}\n\nTo be at y=9 at T=17, that means after 6 actions, y17=9.\n\ny17 = y11 + sum_{i=11}^{16} Δy_i =2 + sum of 6 Δy =9, so sum=7, impossible with 6 actions, each max +1, sum max 6, so y17 <=8.\n\nCannot reach y=9 before T=18.\n\nEarliest at T=18 with all U.\n\nBut with cars, impossible for H=7.\n\nFor H=8, impossible as above.\n\nFor H=9, we have the same issue with y17.\n\nBut for T=17, we need y17 not 7 and not 8.\n\nSince y17 cannot be 9, y17 must be <=6.\n\nSimilarly for T=16, y16 <=6.\n\nThen for T=18, we can have y18=9.\n\nBut y18=9 requires that after 7 actions, y18=9.\n\ny18 = y11 + sum_{i=11}^{17} Δy_i =2 + sum of 7 Δy =9, so sum=7, so all 7 actions U, y18=9.\n\nBut then at T=16, y16: with 5 actions from start, y16 = y11 + sum_{i=11}^{15} Δy_i\n\nIf all U, y16 =2 +5*1 =7, but at T=16, y=7 dangerous.\n\nIf we have some S, y16<7, but to have all U later, it may not be consistent.\n\nBut in this case, for y18=9 with all U, y16=7, collision.\n\nIf we have S earlier, y16<7, then to reach y18=9, we need the actions to include U, but with S, y18 may be less.\n\nFor example, if one S in the first 5 actions, then y16 <=6, then to y18=9, need at least 3 U in the last two actions, impossible.\n\ny18 = y16 + Δy16 + Δy17\n\nIf y16 <=6, y18 <=6+2=8<9, cannot reach 9.\n\nSo only way y18=9 is if y16=7 and Δy16=U, Δy17=U, but y16=7 at T=16 dangerous.\n\nOr if y16=8, but with 5 actions, y16<=7, since max increase 5, y16<=7.\n\ny16=7 or less.\n\nIf y16=7, collision at T=16 if we are on it.\n\nIf y16<7, then y18<9.\n\nSo impossible to have y18=9 with y16<=6.\n\nTherefore, for any H, to avoid collision at T=16 and T=17, we need y16<=6 and y17<=6, but then we cannot reach y=9 by T=18 or T=19 with few actions.\n\nThe only way is to have y18=9, so that at T=18, we are at y=9, not 7 or 8, so safe for that turn.\n\nThen for T=16 and T=17, we need y16<=6 and y17<=6.\n\nBut as above, if y16<=6 and y17<=6, then from y17 to y18, y18 = y17 + Δy17 <=6+1=7<9, cannot reach 9.\n\nContradiction.\n\nUnless we reach y=9 before, but we can't before T=18.\n\nSo the only possibility is to be on y=7 or y=8 at safe times, but the safe times are T=15 for both, or T=19 for y=7, T=20 for y=8.\n\nBut with the path, it's tight.\n\nPerhaps use down actions to stay lower longer.\n\nFor example, from T=15 y=6, instead of staying, go down to y=5 or something, but that would require more turns to go up later.\n\nBut let's calculate the min H.\n\nFrom y=2 to y=9, min 7 turns, but with obstacles, we may need to wait.\n\nThe dangerous period is T=16 to 19 for the upper freeways.\n\nWe can be at y=6 until T=18, then go up to y=9 at T=20 or later.\n\nFor example, at T=15 y=6\n\na15=S, y16=6 T=16 y=6 safe\n\na16=S, y17=6 T=17 y=6 safe\n\na17=S, y18=6 T=18 y=6 safe\n\nThen a17 is at T=17, y18=6\n\nThen at T=18, y=6, action a18=U, y19=7\n\nAt T=19, y=7, which is safe for y=7 (T=19 safe)\n\nThen a19=U, y20=8\n\nBut at T=20, y=8, and T=20 safe for y=8.\n\nThen a20=U, y21=9\n\nSo at T=21, y=9.\n\nH=10 actions? Let's count.\n\nActions from T=11 to T=20 for 10 actions, y21=9.\n\nT_final=21.\n\nBut we can optimize.\n\nAt T=19, y=7, safe, then we can go directly to y=9? No, only one step.\n\na19=U, y20=8\n\nThen a20=U, y21=9\n\nBut from T=19 y=7 to y21=9, two steps.\n\nTo reach faster, from T=18 y=6, a18=U, y19=7, T=19 y=7 safe\n\na19=U, y20=8, T=20 y=8 safe (T=20 safe)\n\na20=U, y21=9\n\nBut at T=20, y=8, safe.\n\nThen y21=9.\n\nH=10 actions, T=21.\n\nBut we can reach y=9 at T=20 if we are higher earlier.\n\nSince y=7 at T=19 is safe, and y=8 at T=20 is safe, we can go from y=6 to y=7 at T=19, then to y=8 at T=20, to y=9 at T=21.\n\nBut min turn to be at y=6 is T=15 with all U.\n\nThen from there, we need to wait until T=18 to move, but we can move at T=15.\n\nAt T=15 y=6, if we go U at T=15, y16=7, dangerous.\n\nBut T=15 is safe for y=7, but at T=15, position is y=6, action at T=15 determines y16.\n\nTo be on y=7 at T=15, we need to arrive at T=15.\n\nWith all U from start: T=11 y=2, a11=U y12=3, a12=U y13=4, a13=U y14=5, a14=U y15=6, so at T=15 y=6.\n\nTo be at y=7 at T=15, we need to be faster, but impossible, min at T=15 is y=6.\n\nSo we can be at y=7 at T=16 at earliest, but dangerous.\n\nOr at T=19.\n\nSo let's be at y=7 at T=19.\n\nTo be at y=7 at T=19, from y11=2, in 8 actions ( to T=18), y19 = y11 + sum_{i=11}^{18} Δy_i =2 + sum of 8 Δy =7, so sum=5, so 5 U and 3 S, for example.\n\nThen at T=19, y=7, safe.\n\nThen a19=U, y20=8, T=20 y=8 safe\n\na20=U, y21=9\n\nH=10 actions.\n\nBut we can reach y=8 at T=20 directly.\n\ny20=8, then U to y21=9.\n\nBut at T=20, y=8 safe.\n\nTo have y20=8, from y11=2, sum of 9 actions Δy =6, so 6 U and 3 S, etc.\n\nBut still around 10 actions.\n\nMin H might be 10.\n\nBut let's see if we can do with H=9.\n\nSuppose we are at y=6 at T=15.\n\nThen at T=15, we do D, y16=5, then at T=16, y=5 safe.\n\nBut then we are lower, so it takes more turns to go up.\n\nFor example, from y16=5, then we can go up, but during T=17,18, we might hit dangerous times.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nPerhaps accept collision at some point, but we must avoid.\n\nAnother idea: since the player can move down, we can go to lower freeways to wait, but all lower are safe, so we can stay at y=6.\n\nBut to avoid the dangerous turns, we need to be on y=6 during T=16,17,18.\n\nThen at T=18, y=6, we go U to y19=7, but T=19 y=7 safe, as above.\n\nThen U to y20=8, T=20 safe, U to y21=9.\n\nSo from T=15 to T=18, we stay at y=6 for 3 turns, but we have actions.\n\nT=15: y=6, action a15=S, so y16=6\n\nT=16: y=6, action a16=S, y17=6\n\nT=17: y=6, action a17=S, y18=6\n\nT=18: y=6, action a18=U, y19=7\n\nT=19: y=7, action a19=U, y20=8\n\nT=20: y=8, action a20=U, y21=9\n\nActions from T=11 to T=20, 10 actions.\n\nBut from T=11 to T=14, we have 4 actions to go from y=2 to y=6, which we did with 4 U.\n\nSo actions:\n\nT=11: U, y12=3\n\nT=12: U, y13=4\n\nT=13: U, y14=5\n\nT=14: U, y15=6\n\nT=15: S, y16=6\n\nT=16: S, y17=6\n\nT=17: S, y18=6\n\nT=18: U, y19=7\n\nT=19: U, y20=8\n\nT=20: U, y21=9\n\nH=10, reached at T=21.\n\nBut at T=19, y=7, safe; T=20, y=8, safe.\n\nNo collision.\n\nCan we reduce H?\n\nFor example, instead of staying 3 times, stay less.\n\nBut the dangerous period for y=7 is up to T=18, so we can go to y=7 at T=19.\n\nSimilarly for y=8, dangerous up to T=19, so go at T=20.\n\nBut to go to y=7 at T=19, from y=6 at T=18.\n\ny18=6, a18=U, y19=7, T=19 y=7 safe.\n\nThen to y=8 at T=20, a19=U, y20=8, T=20 safe.\n\nThen to y=9 at T=21, a20=U, y21=9.\n\nSame as above.\n\nIf we can be at y=7 at T=19 with fewer stays earlier.\n\nBut from start to T=15, we need to be at y=6, which takes 4 actions with all U.\n\nThen from T=15 to T=18, we need to stay at y=6 for 3 turns to avoid moving to y=7 or 8 during dangerous times.\n\nSo minimum 4 to reach y=6, then 3 stays, then 3 up to y=9, total actions 4+3+3=10, H=10.\n\nWith the stays, we have 4 U to reach y=6, 3 S, then 3 U to go to 9, total 7 U and 3 S, sum Δy=7, y from 2 to 9.\n\nH=10.\n\nPerhaps we can have less stays if we go down, but that would increase turns.\n\nSo probably H=10 is the minimal.\n\nNow for the sequence, we need to output the actions from t_1=11.\n\nSo actions for turn 11 to turn 20.\n\nAs above:\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U  // now at T=15, y=6\n\nTurn 15: S  // stay at y=6\n\nTurn 16: S  // stay\n\nTurn 17: S  // stay\n\nTurn 18: U  // to y=7 at T=19\n\nTurn 19: U  // to y=8 at T=20\n\nTurn 20: U  // to y=9 at T=21\n\nBut at turn 20, action a20, y21=9.\n\nThe sequence should be for turns from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nH=10, so turns 11 to 20.\n\nAnd we reach at T=21.\n\nBut in the output, we need to specify the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, at each turn, the action.\n\nNow, in the car states, for freeway 7 and 8, we have the dangerous times, but in this path, we avoid them.\n\nAt T=19, y=7, freeway 7: at T=19, Δt=8, span for car: [-31+4*8, -20+4*8] = [-31+32, -20+32] = [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly at T=20, y=8, freeway 8: Δt=9, [ -26+3*9, -15+3*9] = [-26+27, -15+27] = [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAnd other positions safe.\n\nSo this works.\n\nBut can we reach earlier with H=9?\n\nSuppose we reach y=9 at T=20 with H=9 actions.\n\nThen y20=9.\n\nWith 9 actions, sum Δy=7, so 7 U and 2 S.\n\nNow, to avoid, for example, be at y=6 at T=15.\n\nThen at T=15, we can go to y=7 at T=16, dangerous, not.\n\nOr stay at T=15, y16=6.\n\nThen at T=16, if we stay, y17=6.\n\nThen at T=17, we need to go up.\n\nBut if we go U at T=17, y18=7, T=18 y=7 dangerous.\n\nIf we go U at T=17, y18=7, collision.\n\nIf we go directly to y=8, but from y=6, not possible.\n\nSo not.\n\nAt T=15, y=6, we go U to y16=7, but T=16 dangerous, collision.\n\nSo no, must wait until T=19 to be on y=7.\n\nThus H=10 is minimal.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nNow for the output.\n\nt_1=11, so actions from turn 11 to turn 20.\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: S\n\nTurn 17: S\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nAnd we reach at turn 21.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be listed.\n\nSince the player position is at (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1? No.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H.\n\nIn this case, after 10 actions, at turn 21.\n\nBut the last action is at turn 20.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nH=10, so t_1 to t_1+9, which is 11 to 20.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd at turn t_1 + H =11+10=21, position (0,9).\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 11\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) is 10. The sequence of actions ensures the player avoids the dangerous times on freeways \\(y = 7\\) and \\(y = 8\\), which are occupied at certain turns:\n\n- Freeway \\(y = 7\\) is dangerous at turns \\(T = 16, 17, 18\\) (relative to \\(t_1 = 11\\), as cars cover \\(x = 0\\).\n- Freeway \\(y = 8\\) is dangerous at turns \\(T = 16, 17, 18, 19\\).\n\nThe safe times to be on \\(y = 7\\) are \\(T \\leq 15\\) or \\(T \\geq 19\\), and on \\(y = 8\\) are \\(T \\leq 15\\) or \\(T \\geq 20\\). Freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 6\\) are always safe, as no cars cover \\(x = 0\\) at any turn.\n\nThe sequence reaches \\(y = 6\\) by turn 15 using all \"U\" (up) actions. It then stays at \\(y = 6\\) for turns 15, 16, and 17 (using \"S\" actions) to avoid being on \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) during the dangerous turns 16, 17, and 18. After the dangerous period, it moves up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 19 (safe, as \\(T = 19 \\geq 19\\)), to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 20 (safe, as \\(T = 20 \\geq 20\\)), and finally to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 21.\n\nThe action sequence for turns \\(t_1 = 11\\) to \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 20\\) is:\n\n- Turn 11: U (moves to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 12)\n- Turn 12: U (moves to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 13)\n- Turn 13: U (moves to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 14)\n- Turn 14: U (moves to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 15)\n- Turn 15: S (stays at \\(y = 6\\) at turn 16)\n- Turn 16: S (stays at \\(y = 6\\) at turn 17)\n- Turn 17: S (stays at \\(y = 6\\) at turn 18)\n- Turn 18: U (moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 19)\n- Turn 19: U (moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 20)\n- Turn 20: U (moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 21)\n\nAt turn 21, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\). Collisions are avoided:\n- At turns 11-15 and 18: Player is on safe freeways or positions.\n- At turns 16 and 17: Player is at \\(y = 6\\), which is always safe.\n- At turn 19: Player is at \\(y = 7\\), and \\(T = 19\\) is safe for \\(y = 7\\) (car span on freeway 7 at \\(T = 19\\) is \\([1, 12]\\), excluding 0).\n- At turn 20: Player is at \\(y = 8\\), and \\(T = 20\\) is safe for \\(y = 8\\) (car span on freeway 8 at \\(T = 20\\) is \\([1, 12]\\), excluding 0).\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: U }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0,3) at turn t1=12. I need to get to (0,9) in the minimum number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The actions are U (up), D (down), or S (stay), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, respectively, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The span changes over time based on direction and speed.\n\nImportant note: if you move to a different y at turn T, you are not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, you are on y_T, and you decide to move to y_{T+1}, but during turn T, you're still on y_T for collision purposes. Collision is checked based on where you are at the start of the turn, I think. Let me read carefully.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\", so at turn T, you are on y_T, and collision is checked for y_T at turn T.\n\nThen, when you move, at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, and collision is checked for that freeway at turn T+1.\n\nAlso, the car spans are given at turn t1=12, and for future turns T, we compute Span(T) based on the initial span at t1 and the time elapsed.\n\nNow, the car states are given for each freeway k (which I assume is y=k, since freeway y=1 to 8).\n\nLet me list the cars for each y.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nSince direction is right, and it's moving right, so at time t, span is [τ + s(t - t1), h + s(t - t1)]? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\"\n\nIn the table, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor freeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nBut which is head and tail? In the update, for right-moving, it says Span(t1) = [τ, h], so I think τ is the tail, h is the head, and since it's moving right, the head is to the right.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it says Span(t1) = [h, τ], so h is head, τ is tail.\n\nIn freeway 1: given as (-48, -95, right, 48). Since direction is right, Span(t1) should be [τ, h], so τ = -95, h = -48? But it's written as (h, τ) in the table? I need to parse the notation.\n\nLook: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for update:\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" so head and tail specified.\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" so it's [tail, head] for right-moving.\n\nBut in the input, it's listed as (head h, tail τ, direction, speed), but for right-moving, the span is [τ, h], meaning tail to head.\n\nI think it's consistent: for any car, (h, τ, d, s) where h and τ are the head and tail positions at t1.\n\nThen for left-moving, span at t1 is [h, τ] with h > τ since it's left-moving, head on right? Let's clarify.\n\nFor left-moving car: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\"\n\nSince it's moving left, decreasing x.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nAnd in both cases, at t1, the head is the one with higher x if we think x increasing right, but for left-moving, head is at higher x, moving left, so span [h, τ] with h > τ.\n\nFor right-moving, head is at higher x, moving right, span [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nIn the input, for each car, it's given as (head h, tail τ, d, s), so h is always the head position, τ is tail.\n\nFor freeway 1: (h, τ, d, s) = (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nSince direction is right, at t1, span is [τ, h] = [-95, -48]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if player is on freeway y at turn T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at time T.\n\nSpan at time T depends on initial span at t1 and time elapsed.\n\nt1 = 12, so for a future turn T, time elapsed is T - 12.\n\nLet τ_elapsed = T - 12.\n\nThen for each car, compute Span(T).\n\nPlayer starts at y=3 at t=12.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and since it's (0,9), and freeways are y=1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 might be safe or something? y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think, so no cars there, so no collision possible at y=0 or y=9.\n\nThe freeways are y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, so y=0 and y=9 are outside, so when player is at y=0 or y=9, no collision can happen because there are no cars.\n\nCollision only on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nSo at y=0 or y=9, it's safe.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,3), which is on freeway y=3, so we need to check for collision at t=12 for y=3.\n\nBut at the start, we are given the state at t1=12, so we need to ensure that at t=12, for y=3, there is no car with 0 in span.\n\nSimilarly for each turn.\n\nNow, the goal is to reach (0,9), which is not a freeway, so once there, no issue.\n\nBut to reach there, we need to be at (0,9) at some turn, meaning after an action, y=9.\n\nNow, minimal H, so probably want to go up as fast as possible, but need to avoid cars.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars for each freeway at t=12.\n\nFreeway y=1: one car: head h=-48, tail τ=-95, direction right, speed 48. So span at t=12: [τ, h] = [-95, -48] since right-moving.\n\nFreeway y=2: two cars: first (h=-48, τ=-59, right, 12), second (h=24, τ=13, right, 12)\n\nFor y=2, cars: (-48, -59, right, 12) and (24, 13, right, 12)\n\nFor first car, right, span [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nSecond car, right, span [τ, h] = [13, 24]\n\nFreeway y=3: similar to y=2? \"3 | (-48, -59, right, 12), (24, 13, right, 12)\" same as y=2?\n\ny=3 has same cars as y=2: (-48, -59, right, 12) and (24, 13, right, 12)\n\nBut different freeway, so separate.\n\nFreeway y=4: (48, 83, left, 36) — direction left, so for left-moving, span at t1 is [h, τ] = [48, 83]? h=48, τ=83, but if left-moving, head should be higher x, but 48 < 83, so [h, τ] = [48,83], but since moving left, head at 83, tail at 48? I think I have confusion.\n\nFor left-moving car: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and it moves left, so h is head, at higher x, τ is tail at lower x.\n\nIn the input: (head h, tail τ, d, s)\n\nFor left-moving, h should be greater than τ.\n\nHere for y=4: (48, 83, left, 36) — h=48, τ=83, but 48 < 83, so if left-moving, head should be at higher x, so probably τ=83 is tail? But it's listed as (head h, tail τ), so h=48, τ=83, but 48 < 83, so for left-moving, head at 83? But it says head h=48, tail τ=83, which is inconsistent because head should be the front.\n\nPerhaps I misread the notation.\n\nLook at the car update rule: for left-moving, \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and it says \"head is at h, tail is at τ\" for left-moving? But in the text: \"For car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail is at τ\" so head and tail are defined, and for left-moving, span is [h, τ] with h > τ, I assume.\n\nBut in y=4: (48, 83, left, 36), if left-moving, head should be at higher x, but 48 and 83, 48<83, so if head is at 48, that would be lower x, but moving left, head should be at higher x. Contradiction.\n\nPerhaps it's a typo or I misread.\n\nSimilarly, for y=5: (48,83, left,36) same as y=4.\n\ny=6: (24,13, right,6) — head 24, tail 13, right, so span [13,24]\n\ny=7: two cars: (-16,-27,right,4) and (48,37,right,4) — first car: head -16, tail -27, right, span [-27,-16]; second car: head 48, tail 37, right, span [37,48]\n\ny=8: (-12,-23,right,3) — head -12, tail -23, right, span [-23,-12]\n\nFor y=4 and y=5, it's (48,83,left,36). If direction left, and head h=48, tail τ=83, but 48 < 83, so if moving left, head should be at higher x, so if x increases to the right, head at 83, tail at 48, so h should be 83, τ should be 48. But it's listed as (48,83), so perhaps the first number is not always head? But the header says \"head h, tail τ\", so for y=4, head=48, tail=83, which implies head at 48, tail at 83, so for left-moving, that would mean the car is oriented with head at lower x, which is strange.\n\nPerhaps for left-moving, the head is at the left end? But that doesn't make sense with the update rule.\n\nLet's read the update rule carefully.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\"\n\nIf h and τ are such that for left-moving, h is the position of the head at t1, and it moves left, so decreasing x, so at T, head at h - s(T-t1), tail at τ - s(T-t1), so if the car is moving left, the head should be at higher x at t1, so h > τ.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, head at higher x, h > τ.\n\nIn y=4, (48,83,left,36), if head=48, tail=83, then h=48 < τ=83, so for left-moving, if h < τ, then at t1, head at 48, tail at 83, but moving left, so the head is at lower x, which means the car is facing left but with head at left, so as it moves left, the head moves left from 48, tail from 83, so span [48,83] at t1, but since moving left, the left end is head, right end is tail.\n\nIn terms of position, at t1, the car occupies from x=48 to x=83, with head at x=48 (left end), tail at x=83 (right end), and it moves left, so both decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, head at right end.\n\nIn the collision, we care about whether 0 is in the span, which is the interval.\n\nFor y=4, car at t1: span [48,83] for left-moving, so as time increases, span shifts left: at T, [48 - 36(T-12), 83 - 36(T-12)]\n\nSimilarly for all.\n\nNow, back to the player at (0,3) at t=12.\n\nWe need to move to y=9.\n\nMinimal turns: since we start at y=3, need to go up 6 steps, but we can move down or stay, but that would increase H, so probably always move up if possible, but need to avoid collisions.\n\nH is the number of turns, so actions from t=12 to t=12+H-1, and at turn t=12+H-1, y=9.\n\nLet t be the turn index, starting from t=12.\n\nAt turn t, player is at y_t, position (0, y_t).\n\nAction a_t determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy = +1 for U, -1 for D, 0 for S.\n\nAfter action at turn t, at turn t+1, position is (0, y_{t+1}).\n\nCollision at turn T if at that turn, y_T is between 1 and 8, and for freeway y_T, there is a car with 0 in its span at time T.\n\nTime T is the turn number.\n\nFor example, at t=12, y=3, freeway y=3 has cars: two cars, both right-moving.\n\nFirst car: (h=-48, τ=-59, right, 12), so span at t=12: [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nSecond car: (h=24, τ=13, right, 12), span [13,24]\n\n0 is not in [-59,-48] nor in [13,24], so at t=12, no collision on y=3.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, we need to check when 0 is in span for each car.\n\nSince the player moves, we need to ensure that for each turn T where y_T is between 1 and 8, 0 not in any car span on that freeway at time T.\n\nAlso, at y=0 or y=9, no issue.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to go up as much as possible.\n\nBut let's see the car movements to find safe times to be on each freeway.\n\nFirst, for each freeway, find when 0 is covered by a car, i.e., 0 in span at time T.\n\nSince the spans move linearly, we can find time intervals when 0 is covered for each car on each freeway.\n\nThen, for each freeway, the unsafe times are when at least one car has 0 in span.\n\nBut since multiple cars, we need the union.\n\nThen for the player, when on a freeway at time T, it must be that for that y, T is not unsafe.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway.\n\nSet t1=12.\n\nFor freeway y=1: one car, right-moving, h=-48, τ=-95, s=48, so span at T: [τ + s(T-12), h + s(T-12)] = [-95 + 48(T-12), -48 + 48(T-12)]\n\n0 in span if -95 + 48(T-12) <= 0 <= -48 + 48(T-12)\n\nSo let u = T-12, time elapsed.\n\nThen -95 + 48u <= 0 <= -48 + 48u\n\nFirst inequality: -95 + 48u <= 0 => 48u <= 95 => u <= 95/48 ≈ 1.979\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -48 + 48u => 48u >= 48 => u >= 1\n\nSo u >=1 and u <= 95/48 ≈1.979, so T-12 >=1 and T-12 <= 95/48\n\nT integer, so u=1, T=13\n\nu=1: -95+48= -47, -48+48=0, so 0 <= 0 <= 0, yes 0 is included.\n\nu=2: -95+96=1, -48+96=48, 1<=0<=48? 0 not >=1, so 0 not in [1,48], so no.\n\nSo only at T=13, 0 is in span for y=1 car.\n\nAt T=13, if player on y=1, collision.\n\nOther times, no car covers 0, so safe except at T=13.\n\nFreeway y=1 has only one car, and unsafe only at T=13.\n\nNow y=2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (h=-48, τ=-59, right, s=12), span at T: [τ + s(T-12), h + s(T-12)] = [-59 +12(T-12), -48 +12(T-12)]\n\n0 in span if -59 +12u <= 0 <= -48 +12u, u=T-12\n\nFirst: -59+12u <=0 => 12u <=59 => u <=59/12≈4.916\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 +12u => 12u >=48 => u>=4\n\nSo u>=4 and u<=59/12≈4.916, so u=4 or u=5? u=4: -59+48= -11, -48+48=0, so -11<=0<=0, yes 0 included.\n\nu=5: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, 1<=0<=12? 0 not >=1, no.\n\nSo only at u=4, T=16.\n\nT-12=u, u=4, T=16.\n\nSecond car on y=2: (h=24, τ=13, right, s=12), span [13 +12(T-12), 24 +12(T-12)] = [13+12u, 24+12u]\n\n0 in span? 13+12u <=0 <=24+12u? But 13+12u >=13 >0 for u>=0, so left end >0, so 0 not <= left end, so never covered. Since min is 13 at u=0, increasing.\n\nSo only first car matters, unsafe at T=16 for y=2.\n\nNow y=3: same as y=2? Cars: (-48,-59,right,12) and (24,13,right,12)\n\nFirst car same as y=2 first car, so unsafe at T=16.\n\nSecond car: same, span [13+12u,24+12u] >0, never covers 0.\n\nSo y=3 unsafe at T=16.\n\ny=4: car (48,83,left,36)\n\nLeft-moving, span at T: [h - s(T-12), τ - s(T-12)] = [48 - 36u, 83 - 36u] since h=48, τ=83, but for left-moving, span is [h, τ] at t1? Earlier we have [48,83] at t1.\n\nAt T: [48 - 36u, 83 - 36u]\n\n0 in span if 48 - 36u <= 0 <= 83 - 36u\n\nFirst: 48 - 36u <=0 => 48 <= 36u => u >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333\n\nSecond: 0 <= 83 - 36u => 36u <=83 => u <= 83/36 ≈2.305\n\nSo u >= 1.333 and u <= 2.305, so u=2 since u integer? u=1: 48-36=12, 83-36=47, 12<=0<=47? 0 not >=12, no\n\nu=2: 48-72= -24, 83-72=11, -24<=0<=11, yes 0 included.\n\nu=3: 48-108= -60, 83-108= -25, -60<=0<= -25? 0 not <= -25, no.\n\nSo only at u=2, T=14.\n\ny=5: same car as y=4, (48,83,left,36), so same, unsafe at T=14.\n\ny=6: car (24,13,right,6) — head 24, tail 13, right, s=6, span at T: [τ + s u, h + s u] = [13 +6u, 24+6u]\n\n0 in span? 13+6u <=0 <=24+6u? But 13+6u >=13>0, so never, since left end min 13.\n\nSo always safe for y=6? But there might be cars, but this car never covers 0.\n\ny=6 has only one car? According to table: \"6 | (24, 13, right, 6)\" so one car, and it never covers 0, so y=6 is always safe? But we need to confirm.\n\nSpan min at u=0 is [13,24], both positive, and increasing, so 0 never in span. So yes, no car covers 0 at any time for y=6. So y=6 is always safe.\n\nNow y=7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-16,-27,right,4) — head -16, tail -27, right, s=4, span [τ + s u, h + s u] = [-27 +4u, -16 +4u]\n\n0 in span if -27+4u <=0 <= -16+4u\n\nFirst: -27+4u <=0 => 4u <=27 => u<=27/4=6.75\n\nSecond: 0 <= -16+4u => 4u >=16 => u>=4\n\nSo u>=4 and u<=6.75, so u=4,5,6\n\nu=4: -27+16= -11, -16+16=0, -11<=0<=0, yes\n\nu=5: -27+20= -7, -16+20=4, -7<=0<=4, yes\n\nu=6: -27+24= -3, -16+24=8, -3<=0<=8, yes\n\nu=7: -27+28=1, -16+28=12, 1<=0<=12? no\n\nSo unsafe for u=4,5,6 i.e. T=16,17,18\n\nT=12+u, u=4,5,6 → T=16,17,18\n\nSecond car on y=7: (48,37,right,4) — head 48, tail 37, right, s=4, span [37+4u, 48+4u]\n\nMin 37>0, so never covers 0. Always safe from this car.\n\nBut first car makes y=7 unsafe at T=16,17,18.\n\nNow y=8: car (-12,-23,right,3) — head -12, tail -23, right, s=3, span [τ + s u, h + s u] = [-23 +3u, -12 +3u]\n\n0 in span if -23+3u <=0 <= -12+3u\n\nFirst: -23+3u <=0 => 3u <=23 => u<=23/3≈7.666\n\nSecond: 0 <= -12+3u => 3u >=12 => u>=4\n\nSo u>=4 and u<=7.666, so u=4,5,6,7\n\nu=4: -23+12= -11, -12+12=0, -11<=0<=0, yes\n\nu=5: -23+15= -8, -12+15=3, -8<=0<=3, yes\n\nu=6: -23+18= -5, -12+18=6, -5<=0<=6, yes\n\nu=7: -23+21= -2, -12+21=9, -2<=0<=9, yes\n\nu=8: -23+24=1, -12+24=12, 1<=0<=12? no\n\nSo unsafe at u=4,5,6,7 i.e. T=16,17,18,19\n\nNow, summarize unsafe times for each freeway:\n\ny=1: unsafe only at T=13\n\ny=2: unsafe at T=16\n\ny=3: unsafe at T=16\n\ny=4: unsafe at T=14\n\ny=5: unsafe at T=14\n\ny=6: always safe\n\ny=7: unsafe at T=16,17,18\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=16,17,18,19\n\ny=6 always safe, good.\n\nPlayer starts at t=12, y=3.\n\nAt t=12, y=3, which is unsafe? But at t=12, for y=3, we checked, no car covers 0, so safe. Unsafe only at specific times.\n\nAt t=12, for all y, we need to see if safe at that time.\n\nFor example, y=3 at t=12: u=0, span first car [-59,-48], second [13,24], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nNow, we need to go from y=3 to y=9 in min turns.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S, but D or S would delay, so probably U when possible.\n\nBut need to avoid being on unsafe freeway at unsafe times.\n\nSince y=6 is always safe, we can stay there if needed.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no freeway.\n\nNow, the path: from y=3, we can go up to y=4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut y=4 and y=5 unsafe at T=14.\n\ny=1,2,3 have unsafe times but we start above.\n\nSince we start at y=3, and need to go up, let's see the timeline.\n\nLet me denote the turn t.\n\nAt t=12, position y=3. Safe, as checked.\n\nNow, we choose action a_{12}, which determines y_{13}.\n\nSimilarly for next turns.\n\nWe want to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nMin H: if no cars, we could go U each turn, from t=12 to t=17, in 5 turns: t12: y=3, a=U, t13:y=4, a=U, t14:y=5, a=U, t15:y=6, a=U, t16:y=7, a=U, t17:y=8, a=U, t18:y=9.\n\nBut at t=14, y=5? Let's see the positions at each turn.\n\nAt turn t, y_t.\n\nt=12: y=3\n\nAfter a_{12}, y_{13} = y_12 + Δy\n\nAt turn t=13, position is (0, y_{13}), and we check collision for y_{13} at time t=13.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nt=12: y=3, safe as above.\n\na_{12} = U, so y_{13} = 4\n\nt=13: y=4, now check for y=4 at t=13.\n\ny=4 unsafe at T=14, but t=13, u=t-12=1, for y=4 car, span at u=1: [48-36(1), 83-36(1)] = [48-36, 83-36] = [12,47], 0 not in [12,47], so safe? Earlier we have unsafe only at T=14.\n\nAt t=13, u=1, span [48-36,83-36]=[12,47], 12>0, so 0 not <=12? 0 < 12, not in span, so safe.\n\nt=14: y=5? After a_{13}, suppose a_{13}=U, y_{14}=5\n\nt=14: y=5, now at t=14, u=2, y=5 car: same as y=4, span [48-72,83-72]=[-24,11], 0 in [-24,11], yes, so collision! Unsafe.\n\nIn the naive path, at t=14, if y=5, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we were on y=4 at t=14, also unsafe.\n\nBut in the sequence, at t=14, we are on y=5.\n\nSo we need to avoid being on y=4 or y=5 at t=14.\n\nAlso, at t=13, if we are on y=4, it was safe, but moving to y=5 at t=14 causes issue.\n\nWe could stay or go down, but that might take more time.\n\nSince y=6 is always safe, we can go to y=6 quickly and stay there if needed, but we need to go up.\n\nMin H: from y=3 to y=9, need +6 in y, each U increases y by 1, so min 6 actions of U, but with S or D, more turns.\n\nBut we might need to wait or detour to avoid unsafe times.\n\nNow, unsafe times:\n\n- At t=13, y=1 is unsafe, but we are at y=3, not going to y=1 probably.\n\n- t=14: y=4 and y=5 unsafe\n\n- t=16: y=2, y=3, y=7, y=8 unsafe? y=2 and y=3 unsafe only at t=16, y=7 and y=8 unsafe from t=16 on.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nt=14: unsafe for y=4 and y=5\n\nt=16: unsafe for y=2, y=3, y=7\n\nAlso y=7 unsafe at t=17,18; y=8 at t=16-19.\n\nBut y=2 and y=3 only at t=16.\n\nNow, we start at t=12, y=3.\n\nWe need to be careful around t=14 and t=16.\n\ny=6 always safe, so we can use it as refuge.\n\nTo minimize turns, we should go up when possible.\n\nOne way: at t=12, we can go U to y=4 at t=13.\n\nt=12: action a_{12}, after that y_{13}\n\nSet t=12: position y=3\n\nAction a_{12}: if U, y_{13}=4\n\nThen at t=13: y=4, which is safe as above (u=1, span [12,47], 0 not in)\n\nNow, at t=13, we need to choose a_{13}.\n\nIf we go U, y_{14}=5, but at t=14, y=5 unsafe.\n\nIf we go S, y_{14}=4, but at t=14, y=4 unsafe.\n\nIf we go D, y_{14}=3, then at t=14, y=3: is it safe?\n\nt=14, u=2, y=3 cars: first car span at u=2: [-59 +12*2, -48 +12*2] = [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car [13+24,24+24]=[37,48], not.\n\nSo y=3 safe at t=14.\n\nBut if we go D from y=4 at t=13, to y=3 at t=14.\n\nThen we are at y=3 at t=14, safe.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nFrom t=14, y=3, we can go U, etc.\n\nBut let's see the time.\n\nWe lost one turn by going down or stay, but we avoided collision.\n\nAnother option: at t=13, instead of going to y=5, we could go directly to y=6, but we can only change by +1 or -1 per turn.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t ±1 or 0, so from y=4, we can go to y=5,4, or 3, not directly to 6.\n\nSo from t=13 y=4, actions: U to 5, S to 4, D to 3.\n\nAll lead to potential issues at t=14.\n\nTo avoid being on y=4 or y=5 at t=14, we should not be on those at turn t=14.\n\nSince at t=13, if we are on y=4, we can choose to move to y=3, y=4, or y=5 at t=14.\n\nBut at t=14, y=4 and y=5 are unsafe, so we should not be on them, meaning we should move to y=3 or to y=6? But from y=4, we can only go to y=3,4,5, not to 6 directly.\n\nSo if at t=13 y=4, and we go to y=3 at t=14, then y=3 is safe at t=14.\n\nIf we go to y=5, unsafe.\n\nIf we stay y=4, unsafe.\n\nSo only safe choice is to go down to y=3 at t=14.\n\nThen at t=14, y=3, safe.\n\nNow from there, we can go up.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nAlso, we have t=16 unsafe for some y.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6 is always safe, we can go to y=6 before t=14 and stay there during t=14.\n\nFor example, from start.\n\nt=12: y=3, action U, go to y=4 at t=13.\n\nt=13: y=4, now instead of going to y=5, we could go S or D, but S keeps y=4, which at t=14 unsafe, so not good. D to y=3.\n\nBut we can go to y=6 via other path.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=12, we could go S to stay at y=3 for t=13, then U to y=4 at t=14, but t=14 y=4 unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nGo D to y=2 at t=13, but y=2 at t=13: is it safe?\n\nt=13, u=1, y=2 cars: first car span [-59+12(1), -48+12(1)] = [-47,-36], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car [13+12,24+12]=[25,36], not.\n\nSo y=2 safe at t=13.\n\nBut then at t=13, y=2, we need to go up.\n\nBut y=2 unsafe at t=16, etc.\n\nBut we have t=14 issue.\n\nPerhaps go directly to y=6 quickly.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=12, if we go U to y=4 at t=13.\n\nThen at t=13, y=4, we go U to y=5 at t=14, but unsafe.\n\nUnless we can be on y=6 at t=14.\n\nBut from y=5 at t=14, we can go to y=6, but at t=14 we are on y=5, which is unsafe.\n\nThe collision is at the turn when we are on the freeway.\n\nAt turn T, if on freeway y, and 0 in span at time T.\n\nSo at t=14, if y=5, collision.\n\nTo avoid, we must not be on y=4 or y=5 at t=14.\n\nSimilarly, for other times.\n\nSo for t=14, we should be on y not 4 or 5.\n\nPossible y: 0,1,2,3,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut y=1 at t=14: u=2, y=1 car span [-95+48*2, -48+48*2] = [-95+96, -48+96] = [1,48], 0 not in [1,48], so safe. y=1 unsafe only at t=13.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 at t=14: u=2, span first car [-59+24, -48+24]=[-35,-24], not 0; second [13+24,24+24]=[37,48], not, so safe.\n\ny=3 at t=14: as above, safe.\n\ny=6: always safe.\n\ny=7 at t=14: u=2, cars: first car [-27+4*2, -16+4*2]=[-27+8,-16+8]=[-19,-8], 0 not in; second [37+8,48+8]=[45,56], not, so safe. Unsafe only from t=16.\n\nSimilarly y=8 at t=14: u=2, span [-23+6, -12+6]=[-17,-6], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSo at t=14, only y=4 and y=5 are unsafe; others are safe.\n\nTherefore, at turn t=14, we should not be on y=4 or y=5.\n\nNow back to the path.\n\nAt t=12, y=3.\n\nWe take action a_{12}.\n\nIf a_{12} = U, then y_{13} = 4\n\nThen at t=13, y=4.\n\nNow we need to choose a_{13} such that at t=14, y_{14} not 4 or 5.\n\ny_{14} = y_{13} + Δy = 4 + Δy\n\nIf Δy = +1 (U), y=5\n\nIf Δy = 0 (S), y=4\n\nIf Δy = -1 (D), y=3\n\nSo only y=3,4,5 possible.\n\ny=4 and y=5 are unsafe at t=14, so only safe choice is to go to y=3, i.e., a_{13} = D.\n\nThen y_{14} = 3\n\nAt t=14, y=3, which is safe, as above.\n\nThen from there, we can go up.\n\nBut now we are at y=3 at t=14, same as start but later.\n\nWe lost two turns: from t=12 to t=14, we went to y=4 and back to y=3, so y net zero, but time passed.\n\nAt t=12: y=3\n\nt=13: y=4 (after U)\n\nt=14: y=3 (after D)\n\nNow from t=14, y=3, we can go up.\n\nBut we need to avoid t=16 unsafe for y=3.\n\ny=3 unsafe at t=16.\n\nSimilarly, we can go to y=6 which is safe.\n\nFirst, from t=14, y=3.\n\nAction a_{14}: if U, to y=4 at t=15.\n\nt=15: y=4, now is it safe? y=4 at t=15: u=3, span [48-36*3,83-36*3]=[48-108,83-108]=[-60,-25], 0 not in (since -25<0), so safe. Similarly y=5 at t=15: u=3, same car, span [-60,-25], 0 not in, safe.\n\ny=4 and y=5 unsafe only at t=14.\n\nNow, also y=6 always safe.\n\nSo from t=14 y=3, we can go U to y=4 at t=15.\n\nt=15: y=4, safe.\n\nThen a_{15}: U to y=5 at t=16.\n\nBut t=16, y=5: is it safe? y=5 at t=16: u=4, span [48-144,83-144]=[-96,-61], 0 not in, so safe. y=5 unsafe only at t=14.\n\nBut at t=16, y=5 is safe, but we have other unsafe freeways.\n\ny=5 at t=16 is fine, but if we go to y=5 at t=16, then at t=16 we are on y=5, which is safe.\n\nBut we need to go further.\n\nFrom y=4 at t=15, we could go directly to y=6? But y_{16} = y_{15} + Δy, from y=4, can go to y=5 or y=4 or y=3.\n\nNot to y=6 directly.\n\nSo to y=5 at t=16.\n\nt=16: y=5, safe? Yes, as above.\n\nThen from there, go U to y=6 at t=17.\n\nt=17: y=6, safe.\n\nThen U to y=7 at t=18.\n\nBut t=18, y=7: is it safe?\n\ny=7 unsafe at t=16,17,18.\n\nAt t=18, u=6, y=7 first car span [-27+4*6, -16+4*6]=[-27+24,-16+24]=[-3,8], 0 in [-3,8]? -3<=0<=8, yes, so unsafe.\n\nIf we go to y=7 at t=18, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=8, also unsafe at t=18.\n\nSo we need to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 during unsafe times.\n\nUnsafe times for y=7: t=16,17,18\n\ny=8: t=16,17,18,19\n\ny=6 is safe, so we can stay on y=6 until it's safe to go up.\n\nNow, back to the sequence.\n\nWe have at t=14, y=3 after the detour.\n\nThen:\n\nt=14: y=3\n\na_{14} = U, y_{15} = 4\n\nt=15: y=4, safe\n\na_{15} = U, y_{16} = 5\n\nt=16: y=5, safe (since y=5 unsafe only at t=14)\n\na_{16} = U, y_{17} = 6\n\nt=17: y=6, safe\n\nNow at t=17, y=6, we want to go to y=7.\n\nBut at t=17, y=7 is unsafe (since t=17 is unsafe for y=7).\n\nSimilarly, if we go U to y=7 at t=18, but t=18 also unsafe.\n\nWe can stay at y=6 or go down, but we need to go up.\n\nSince y=7 is unsafe at t=17 and 18, we need to be on y=7 at a safe time.\n\ny=7 safe when? Not unsafe, so for t not 16,17,18.\n\nFor example, t=15: u=3, y=7 first car span [-27+12, -16+12]=[-15,-4], 0 not in; second [37+12,48+12]=[49,60], not, so safe.\n\nt=19: u=7, first car [-27+28, -16+28]=[1,12], 0 not in [1,12]? 0<1, not; second [37+28,48+28]=[65,76], not, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=20, etc.\n\nBut t=16,17,18 unsafe.\n\nSo y=7 safe at t=15,19,20,...\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nNow, at t=17, we are at y=6.\n\nIf we go U to y=7 at t=18, but t=18 unsafe.\n\nIf we go S, stay y=6, safe.\n\nThen at t=18, y=6, we can go U to y=7 at t=19.\n\nt=19: y=7, now u=7, as above, safe.\n\nThen from there go to y=8 and y=9.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFirst, let's list the sequence so far.\n\nt=12: y=3, a_{12}=U, to y=4 at t=13\n\nt=13: y=4, a_{13}=D, to y=3 at t=14  (to avoid t=14 on y=4 or5)\n\nt=14: y=3, a_{14}=U, to y=4 at t=15\n\nt=15: y=4, a_{15}=U, to y=5 at t=16\n\nt=16: y=5, a_{16}=U, to y=6 at t=17\n\nt=17: y=6, now if we go U, to y=7 at t=18, but t=18 y=7 unsafe.\n\nSo instead, at t=17, we can do S, stay y=6, then at t=18, y=6, then a_{18}=U to y=7 at t=19.\n\nt=19: y=7, safe.\n\nThen a_{19}=U to y=8 at t=20.\n\nBut at t=20, y=8: is it safe?\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=16,17,18,19.\n\nt=19: u=7, span [-23+3*7, -12+3*7]=[-23+21, -12+21]=[-2,9], 0 in [-2,9], yes unsafe.\n\nt=20: u=8, span [-23+24, -12+24]=[1,12], 0 not in [1,12], so safe.\n\nSo at t=20, y=8 safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=19 y=8 unsafe.\n\nSo from t=19 y=7, if we go U to y=8 at t=20.\n\nThen t=20: y=8, safe.\n\nThen a_{20}=U to y=9 at t=21.\n\nt=21: y=9, goal.\n\nNow, let's list the turns and actions.\n\nStart t=12, y=3\n\na_{12} = U  → t=13 y=4\n\na_{13} = D  → t=14 y=3\n\na_{14} = U  → t=15 y=4\n\na_{15} = U  → t=16 y=5\n\na_{16} = U  → t=17 y=6\n\na_{17} = S  → t=18 y=6  (stay, since going up unsafe)\n\na_{18} = U  → t=19 y=7\n\na_{19} = U  → t=20 y=8\n\na_{20} = U  → t=21 y=9\n\nNow, at t=21, y=9, reached.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=12 to t=20, that's 9 actions? Let's see.\n\nActions at turns: a_{12}, a_{13}, a_{14}, a_{15}, a_{16}, a_{17}, a_{18}, a_{19}, a_{20} → 9 actions.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t=0 to H-1, but here t starts from 12.\n\nThe sequence is for turns t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so H turns.\n\nIn this case, we have actions from t=12 to t=20, which is 9 turns: t=12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20.\n\nAt turn t=20, action U, to y=9 at t=21.\n\nBut the position after last action is at turn t=12+H-1, which should be (0,9).\n\nHere, after a_{20}, at turn t=21, y=9.\n\nSo t=12+H-1 =21, so 12+H-1=21, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nt=12+H-1=21, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nBut we can do better?\n\nPerhaps avoid the down move.\n\nAnother path: from t=12, y=3, instead of going up immediately, we could go down to y=2 or something, but that seems worse.\n\nOr stay at y=3 until after t=14.\n\nBut at t=12, if we stay, a_{12}=S, then y_{13}=3\n\nt=13: y=3, which is safe.\n\nThen at t=13, we can go U to y=4 at t=14.\n\nBut t=14 y=4 unsafe, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nFrom t=13 y=3, go U to y=4 at t=14, same issue.\n\nSo we must not be on y=4 or y=5 at t=14, so at t=13, we should not be in a position to be forced to y=4 or y=5 at t=14.\n\nAt t=13, if we are on y=3, we can go to y=2,3,4 at t=14.\n\ny=4 unsafe, so we can go to y=2 or y=3.\n\nSimilarly, if on y=4, we can go to y=3.\n\nBut going to y=2 or y=3 might delay.\n\nSince y=6 is safe, we can go to y=6 as fast as possible.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=12, go U to y=4 at t=13.\n\nThen at t=13, instead of going down, we could... but we have to avoid t=14 on y=4/5.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=6 before t=14.\n\nBut from y=3, to y=6, need +3, so min 3 turns: t=12 to t=13 y=4, t=13 to t=14 y=5, but t=14 y=5 unsafe; or if we go slower, but t=14 is the issue.\n\nIf we start at t=12 y=3, a_{12}=S, stay y=3 at t=13.\n\nThen a_{13}=S, stay y=3 at t=14? But at t=14 y=3 is safe, as before.\n\nThen from t=14 y=3, we can go up.\n\nBut we are at y=3 at t=14, same as after the down move, but we used two S instead of U and D, same net, but we delayed.\n\nIn the first sequence, we used U and D to end up at y=3 t=14.\n\nHere if we do S and S, also at y=3 t=14, but with no progress.\n\nWorse.\n\nFrom t=12 y=3, go U to y=4 at t=13.\n\nThen at t=13 y=4, go S to stay y=4? But at t=14 y=4 unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo must go down or something.\n\nPerhaps go to y=1 or other, but y=1 is unsafe at t=13, so not good.\n\nAt t=12, go D to y=2 at t=13.\n\nt=13: y=2, is it safe? Yes, as earlier.\n\nThen at t=13 y=2, we can go U to y=3 at t=14.\n\nt=14: y=3, safe.\n\nThen same as before, at y=3 t=14.\n\nBut we went down to y=2 and up to y=3, same as going to y=4 and back, but to lower y.\n\nWorse because we are at y=3 instead of potentially higher.\n\nIn this case, from t=12 to t=14, we are at y=3, same as starting point after 2 turns.\n\nWhereas in the first sequence, we went to y=4 and back, also to y=3 after 2 turns.\n\nSame.\n\nBut in the first sequence with down move, we have a chance to go up later.\n\nNow, about the t=16 issue.\n\nIn the sequence I had, we reached y=6 at t=17, then had to wait until t=19 to go to y=7.\n\nBut at t=17, y=6, we could go to y=7 at t=18, but unsafe.\n\nUnless we can be on y=7 earlier or later.\n\ny=7 safe at t=15, for example.\n\nt=15: y=7 safe.\n\nBut we are at y=5 at t=16, which is late.\n\nLet's see if we can reach y=7 by t=15.\n\nt=12: y=3\n\nIf we go directly up: a_{12}=U to y=4 t=13\n\nBut then at t=13, if we could go to y=6, but cannot, only to y=5 or less.\n\nSuppose at t=12, we go U to y=4 t=13\n\nThen at t=13, we must go D to y=3 t=14 to avoid t=14 unsafe.\n\nThen t=14 y=3\n\nThen a_{14}=U to y=4 t=15\n\na_{15}=U to y=5 t=16\n\nBut at t=15 y=4, we could go U to y=5 t=16, or to y=6? No, from y=4 to y=5.\n\nTo go to y=6, we need to be at y=5 first.\n\nBut at t=15, y=4, if we go U, to y=5 at t=16.\n\nThen from y=5, go U to y=6 at t=17.\n\nBut if we want to reach y=7 earlier.\n\nFrom t=15 y=4, we can only go to y=5 at t=16, not directly to y=7.\n\nSo cannot reach y=7 before t=17 or so.\n\nt=15: y=4, a=U, t=16 y=5\n\na=U, t=17 y=6\n\na=U, t=18 y=7 but unsafe.\n\nSo we have to wait.\n\nTo avoid the wait at y=6, we can go to y=8 or something, but y=8 also unsafe.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6 is safe, and we need to go to y=9, we can go from y=6 to y=7 when safe, but the unsafe period for y=7 is t=16,17,18.\n\nSo after t=18, safe.\n\nt=19 safe.\n\nSimilarly, from y=7 to y=8, y=8 unsafe until t=19? t=19 unsafe for y=8.\n\nt=19: u=7, y=8 span [-23+21, -12+21]=[-2,9], 0 in, unsafe.\n\nt=20 safe.\n\nSo we need to be on y=7 at t=19 or later, and on y=8 at t=20 or later.\n\nIn the sequence, we go to y=7 at t=19, y=8 at t=20, y=9 at t=21.\n\nNow, can we reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=6 earlier, then go up after t=18.\n\nBut we have the t=14 issue.\n\nAt t=14, we are at y=3.\n\nThen to y=6, need 3 up moves: t=14 to t=15 y=4, t=15 to t=16 y=5, t=16 to t=17 y=6.\n\nBut at t=16, y=5 is safe, as established.\n\nThen at t=17 y=6.\n\nNow from t=17 y=6, if we go U to y=7 at t=18, unsafe.\n\nSo we must wait at y=6 until t=18, then at t=18 go U to y=7 at t=19.\n\nt=18: if we are on y=6, and go U, to y=7 at t=19.\n\nAt turn t=18, we are on y=6, which is safe, no collision.\n\nThen action a_{18}=U, so y_{19}=7.\n\nAt turn t=19, we are on y=7, and since t=19, u=7, y=7 is safe as above.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nBut at t=17, we can only stay or go down, but going down worse.\n\nSo in the sequence, we have to stay at y=6 for one turn.\n\nNow, back to the beginning: at t=12, instead of going up and down, we could go directly to a safe y and wait.\n\nBut y=6 is safe, but we need to get there.\n\nFrom t=12 y=3 to y=6, min 3 turns: t=12 U to y=4 t=13, but t=13 y=4, then if U to y=5 t=14, unsafe; if not U, then slower.\n\nSo cannot reach y=6 by t=13 or t=14 without being on y=5 at t=14.\n\nt=12 to t=13 y=4 (if U), t=13 to t=14 y=5 (if U), but t=14 y=5 unsafe.\n\nIf at t=13 go D to y=3 t=14, then at t=14 y=3, then to y=6: t=14 U to y=4 t=15, U to y=5 t=16, U to y=6 t=17.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf we start by going to y=2 or something, worse.\n\nSo the first sequence seems necessary for the t=14 issue.\n\nNow, about the actions: in the sequence I have, with H=10, reaching at t=21.\n\nBut let's count the turns.\n\nActions from t=12 to t=20 inclusive? Turns: we have actions for t=12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20 → 9 actions.\n\nAfter a_{20}, at t=21, y=9.\n\nThe turn when we reach y=9 is t=21.\n\nt_1 + H - 1 = 12 + H - 1 = 21, so 11 + H = 21? 12 + H - 1 = 21, so H - 1 = 9, H=10.\n\nYes.\n\nCan we do with less?\n\nSuppose we avoid the down move by going to y=6 via a different path, but I don't see.\n\nAnother idea: at t=12, go U to y=4 t=13.\n\nThen at t=13, go U to y=5? But then at t=14, y=5, unsafe, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nUnless we move so that at t=14 we are not on y=4 or y=5, but from y=5 at t=13, we can only be at y=4,5,6 at t=14? y_{14} = y_{13} + Δy, y=5, so y=4,5,6.\n\ny=6 is safe at t=14.\n\nIf at t=13, we are at y=5, then we can go U to y=6 at t=14.\n\nBut to be at y=5 at t=13, we need to have gone from t=12 to t=13 to y=5.\n\nBut from y=3 at t=12, we can only go to y=4 at t=13, not directly to y=5.\n\nSo at t=13, we are at y=4 if we went U from t=12.\n\nThen from y=4, to go to y=6, we need to go through y=5, but at t=14, if we go to y=5, unsafe; if we go to y=6, but from y=4, we can go to y=5, not directly to y=6.\n\nSo impossible to be on y=6 at t=14 from start without being on y=5 at some point.\n\nSpecifically, to be on y=6 at turn t=14, we need y_{14} =6.\n\ny_{14} depends on previous.\n\nAt t=13, y_{13}, then a_{13} such that y_{14} = y_{13} + Δy =6.\n\nSo y_{13} must be 5,6, or7? Since Δy = ±1 or 0, so y_{13} could be 5,6,7 to reach y=6.\n\nBut at t=13, if y_{13}=5, then we can go S to y=6? Δy=0 stays, so to go to y=6 from y=5, we need U, to y=6.\n\nSimilarly, from y=7, D to y=6.\n\nBut at t=13, what is possible.\n\nFrom start, at t=12 y=3, we can only reach y=4 at t=13 with U, or y=3 with S, or y=2 with D.\n\nCannot reach y=5 at t=13.\n\nSo y_{13} can be 2,3,4.\n\nThus at t=13, y_{13} <=4, so to have y_{14}=6, we need y_{13}=5 or6 or7, but y_{13}<=4, so impossible to have y_{14}=6.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be on y=6 at t=14.\n\nTherefore, the only way to avoid being on y=4 or y=5 at t=14 is to be on y<=3 or y>=6, but y>=6 impossible at t=14 from start, so must be on y<=3 at t=14.\n\nThus, in the path, we must have y_{14} <=3.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence, we have y=3 at t=14.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nNow, about t=16 to t=19 unsafe for upper freeways.\n\nBut in the sequence, we go to y=6 at t=17, then wait until t=18 to stay, then go to y=7 at t=19.\n\nCan we reach y=6 earlier?\n\nFrom t=14 y=3:\n\nt=14: a=U to y=4 t=15\n\nt=15: a=U to y=5 t=16\n\nt=16: a=U to y=6 t=17\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf at t=15 y=4, we go U to y=5 t=16, same.\n\nNo faster.\n\nAt t=16, we are at y=5, which is safe, but we go to y=6 at t=17.\n\ny=6 is safe, but we have to wait.\n\nSince y=6 is safe, and we need to go to y=7, which is unsafe until after t=18, we can stay at y=6 for multiple turns, but that increases H.\n\nIn this case, we stay only one extra turn at y=6.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=8 or y=9 directly, but no, step by step.\n\nAnother thing: at t=17 y=6, we go S to stay at t=18 y=6, then U to y=7 at t=19.\n\nBut at t=18, y=6, we could go U to y=7 at t=19, same.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 faster, but we have to pass through y=7 and y=8.\n\ny=8 unsafe until t=20.\n\nIn the sequence, we go to y=7 at t=19, y=8 at t=20, y=9 at t=21.\n\nt=19 y=7 safe, t=20 y=8 safe, t=21 y=9.\n\nCan we be on y=8 at t=20?\n\nBut to be on y=8 at t=20, we need to come from y=7 or y=9, but y=9 not yet.\n\ny=7 at t=19, then U to y=8 at t=20.\n\nBut y=7 at t=19 is safe, as above.\n\nIs there a way to be on y=7 earlier? For example, at t=15.\n\nBut to be at y=7 at t=15: from start, t=12 y=3, to t=13 y=4 (U), t=14 y=5? But t=14 y=5 unsafe, cannot.\n\nFrom t=12, if we go U to y=4 t=13, then D to y=3 t=14, then to y=7: t=14 U to y=4 t=15, U to y=5 t=16, U to y=6 t=17, then to y=7 t=18 but unsafe, so not earlier.\n\nThus, cannot reach y=7 before t=19 safely.\n\nt=19 is the earliest we can be on y=7.\n\nSimilarly for y=8 at t=20.\n\nThus, the sequence I have seems minimal.\n\nNow, to write the actions.\n\nTurn t=12: action U\n\nTurn t=13: action D\n\nTurn t=14: action U\n\nTurn t=15: action U\n\nTurn t=16: action U\n\nTurn t=17: action S  (stay)\n\nTurn t=18: action U\n\nTurn t=19: action U\n\nTurn t=20: action U\n\nAfter a_{20}, at t=21, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: 9 actions, from t=12 to t=20, so H=9? But t=12 to t=20 is 9 turns, but we reach at t=21, which is after H actions.\n\nThe turns of actions are t_1 to t_1 + H - 1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position.\n\nBut the position after last action is at turn t_1 + H.\n\nWe need to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1? Let's see the task.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\"\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\"\n\nIn the sequence, after actions from t=0 to H-1, at turn t1 + H - 1, position is (0,9).\n\nIn this case, t1=12, so at turn 12 + H - 1, y=9.\n\nIn my sequence, at turn 21, y=9, so 12 + H - 1 = 21, so H - 1 = 9, H=10.\n\nActions for t=12 to t=12 + 9 = t=21? t from t1 to t1 + H - 1.\n\nt1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so for t=0, turn t1; t=1, turn t1+1; ... up to t=H-1, turn t1 + H - 1.\n\nAnd at turn t1 + H - 1, position should be (0,9).\n\nIn my case, at turn t=20, position is? Let's list the positions at the start of each turn.\n\nAt turn t=12: position (0,3), we take action a_{12}\n\nAfter action, at turn t=13, position (0, y_{13})\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAfter last action at turn t, at turn t+1 position.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt turn T: player is at (0, y_T), takes action a_T, then at turn T+1, position (0, y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy)\n\nCollision checked at turn T for y_T.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn t=12: position y=3, take a_{12}=U → y_{13}=4\n\nTurn t=13: position y=4, take a_{13}=D → y_{14}=3\n\nTurn t=14: position y=3, take a_{14}=U → y_{15}=4\n\nTurn t=15: position y=4, take a_{15}=U → y_{16}=5\n\nTurn t=16: position y=5, take a_{16}=U → y_{17}=6\n\nTurn t=17: position y=6, take a_{17}=S → y_{18}=6\n\nTurn t=18: position y=6, take a_{18}=U → y_{19}=7\n\nTurn t=19: position y=7, take a_{19}=U → y_{20}=8\n\nTurn t=20: position y=8, take a_{20}=U → y_{21}=9\n\nNow, at turn t=20, we take action, and after that at turn t=21, y=9.\n\nBut the position at turn t=20 is (0,8), not (0,9).\n\nWe need to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1.\n\nt1=12, so let K = t1 + H - 1, at turn K, position (0,9).\n\nIn this case, at turn t=21, position (0,9), so K=21.\n\nt1 + H - 1 = 12 + H - 1 = 21, so H=10.\n\nThe actions are for turns from t1 to t1 + H - 2? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for t=0: turn t1\n\nt=1: turn t1+1\n\n...\n\nt=H-1: turn t1 + H - 1\n\nAnd at turn t1 + H - 1, after taking action, position should be (0,9)? No.\n\nAt turn T, we take action a_T, which determines the position at turn T+1.\n\nThe position at turn T is before taking action.\n\nThe task says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\"\n\nSo at the start of turn t1 + H - 1, position is (0,9).\n\nIn the action sequence, we take actions from turn t1 to turn t1 + H - 2, which determine the position at turn t1 + H - 1.\n\nFor example, if H=1, actions for t=0 to 0, only turn t1, take action, then at turn t1 +1, position.\n\nBut we need position at turn t1 + H - 1 to be (0,9).\n\nIf H=1, position at turn t1 + 1 -1 = t1 should be (0,9), but at turn t1, we start, position given, not necessarily (0,9).\n\nIn this case, start at (0,3), so H>1.\n\nGenerally, actions from turn t1 to turn t1 + H - 2 determine y at turn t1 + H - 1.\n\nThe last action is at turn t1 + H - 2, leading to position at turn t1 + H - 1.\n\nIn my sequence, to have position at turn K=21 be (0,9), we need the action at turn 20 to be such that after it, at turn 21, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn t=20, we take a_{20}=U, from y=8 to y=9 at t=21.\n\nSo at turn t=21, position (0,9).\n\nNow, the actions are from turn t=12 to t=20, which is turns 12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20 → 9 actions.\n\nt from 12 to 20 inclusive is 9 turns.\n\nThe indices: turn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt1 + H - 1 = 20? But we need position at turn t1 + H - 1 to be (0,9), which is turn 21.\n\nSet t1 + H - 1 = 21, t1=12, so 12 + H - 1 =21, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nThen actions for t=0 to 9: turns 12+0=12, 12+1=13, ..., 12+9=21? t from 0 to H-1=9, so turns t1 + t for t=0 to 9: 12 to 21.\n\nBut at turn 21, we take action a_{21}, but we need position at turn t1 + H - 1 =21 to be (0,9), which is before taking action.\n\nIf at turn 21, position is (0,9), that means we reached before taking any action at turn 21.\n\nBut the action at turn 21 would determine next position.\n\nIn the sequence, if we take actions up to turn 20, then at turn 21, position is (0,9), and no action needed, or we don't take action at turn 21.\n\nIn the action sequence, we specify actions from turn t1 to turn t1 + H - 1? Let's read the task.\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nAnd \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\"\n\nAt turn t1 + H - 1, position is (0,9), which means that the actions from turn t1 to turn t1 + H - 2 have been taken, leading to position at turn t1 + H - 1.\n\nFor example, actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1 + H - 2.\n\nThen at turn t1 + H - 1, position is (0,9), and we don't take an action there or something.\n\nIn the sequence, we specify H actions? {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, so for t=0: a_{t1}, t=1: a_{t1+1}, ..., t=H-1: a_{t1 + H - 1}\n\nAnd at turn t1 + H - 1, after taking this action, position should be? But the reach is at turn t1 + H - 1, before or after?\n\nThe phrase: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\"\n\nAnd turn t1 + H - 1 is when we take the last action a_{t1 + H - 1}.\n\nAfter taking a_{t1 + H - 1}, the position changes to the next turn.\n\nI think there is ambiguity.\n\nLook: \"at turn t1 + H - 1\" and \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\"\n\nIn the context, at turn T, position is fixed before action.\n\nAfter action, position at turn T+1.\n\nTo have position (0,9) at turn K, it means at the start of turn K.\n\nThen, the actions taken from turn t1 to turn K-1 determine that position.\n\nFor K = t1 + H - 1.\n\nThen actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., K-1 = t1 + H - 2.\n\nNumber of actions: from t1 to t1 + H - 2, that's (t1 + H - 2) - t1 + 1 = H - 1 actions.\n\nBut the sequence is specified for t=0 to H-1, which is H actions.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nPerhaps the actions include up to turn t1 + H - 1, and at that turn, after action, position is at turn t1 + H.\n\nBut we need position at turn t1 + H - 1 to be (0,9).\n\nI think I need to clarify.\n\nLet me assume that at turn T, position is y_T.\n\nTake action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nCollision at turn T if y_T in 1-8 and 0 in car span at T.\n\nReach when at some turn T, y_T =9.\n\nIn the sequence, with actions from t=12 to t=20, 9 actions, we have y_21=9, so reached at turn 21.\n\nTurn 21 = t1 + 9, since t1=12, 12+9=21.\n\nH such that t1 + H - 1 =21, 12 + H -1 =21, H-1=9, H=10.\n\nThen the actions are for turns t1 + t for t=0 to 9: turns 12 to 21.\n\nBut at turn 21, if we take action, it would go to y_22, but we don't need, since we reached at turn 21.\n\nIn the sequence, when we reach, we may not take action.\n\nIn the answer format, we specify actions until the turn before reaching or including.\n\nTo avoid confusion, in my sequence, with 9 actions, we reach at turn 21.\n\nThe minimal H should be 10, with actions from turn 12 to turn 20.\n\nThen at turn 21, position (0,9).\n\nNow for the sequence:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t1} = U\n\nTurn t1+1: a_{t1+1} = D\n\n...\n\nAs before.\n\nPerhaps we can have a shorter path by using y=6 earlier or something, but I think not.\n\nAnother thing: at t=17 y=6, instead of staying, we could go down and up, but that would be worse, no benefit.\n\nOr go to y=5, but y=5 is safe, but then we need to go back up, worse.\n\nSo the sequence is fine.\n\nNow, write the actions.\n\nAlso, for the cars, we need to ensure no collision at each step.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAt turn 12: y=3, safe as before.\n\nAction U, to y=4 at t=13.\n\nAt turn 13: y=4, u=t-12=1, y=4 car span [48-36(1),83-36(1)]=[12,47], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction D, to y=3 at t=14.\n\nAt turn 14: y=3, u=2, span first car [-59+24,-48+24]=[-35,-24], not 0; second [13+24,24+24]=[37,48], not, safe.\n\nAction U, to y=4 at t=15.\n\nAt turn 15: y=4, u=3, span [48-108,83-108]=[-60,-25], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction U, to y=5 at t=16.\n\nAt turn 16: y=5, u=4, span [48-144,83-144]=[-96,-61], 0 not in, safe. (y=5 same car)\n\nAction U, to y=6 at t=17.\n\nAt turn 17: y=6, always safe, no car covers 0.\n\nAction S, to y=6 at t=18. (stay)\n\nAt turn 18: y=6, safe.\n\nAction U, to y=7 at t=19.\n\nAt turn 19: y=7, u=7, span first car [-27+28,-16+28]=[1,12], 0 not in [1,12]; second [37+28,48+28]=[65,76], not, so safe.\n\nAction U, to y=8 at t=20.\n\nAt turn 20: y=8, u=8, span [-23+24,-12+24]=[1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction U, to y=9 at t=21.\n\nReached.\n\nAll safe.\n\nNow actions: for turns 12 to 20: a12=U, a13=D, a14=U, a15=U, a16=U, a17=S, a18=U, a19=U, a20=U.\n\nH=10 actions? Turns from 12 to 20 is 9 turns, but H=10 as calculated.\n\nIn the sequence, actions at turns: 12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20 → 9 actions.\n\nFor H=10, we need actions from turn 12 to turn 21? But at turn 21, we don't need action since we reached.\n\nIn the answer, for H=10, actions from t=0 to 9: turns 12 to 21.\n\nBut at turn 21, if we specify action, it would be after reaching, not necessary.\n\nBut to be consistent, in the sequence, we can include the action to reach or not.\n\nI think for the output, we list the actions until the position is reached.\n\nIn this case, with 9 actions, we reach at turn 21.\n\nSo minimal H is 10 with the actions above.\n\nNow write the answer.\n\nThe current turn is t1=12.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: D\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: S\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nAfter that, at turn 21, y=9.\n\nSo the sequence has 9 actions, for turns 12 to 20.\n\nH=10.\n\nIn the box.\n\nPerhaps we can reach faster by not going down.\n\nFor example, if at t=12, we go S to stay at y=3 for t=13, then at t=13, y=3, go U to y=4 at t=14, but t=14 y=4 unsafe, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nGo D to y=2 at t=13, then to y=3 at t=14, then same as before but at lower y initially, worse.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 10.\n\nActions as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 12\\) is 10. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on an unsafe freeway at the corresponding unsafe times, as derived from the car states and update rules.\n\nThe unsafe times for each freeway are:\n- \\(y = 1\\): unsafe at \\(T = 13\\)\n- \\(y = 2\\): unsafe at \\(T = 16\\)\n- \\(y = 3\\): unsafe at \\(T = 16\\)\n- \\(y = 4\\): unsafe at \\(T = 14\\)\n- \\(y = 5\\): unsafe at \\(T = 14\\)\n- \\(y = 6\\): always safe\n- \\(y = 7\\): unsafe at \\(T = 16, 17, 18\\)\n- \\(y = 8\\): unsafe at \\(T = 16, 17, 18, 19\\)\n\nThe sequence of actions moves the player upward when possible but includes a downward move at turn 13 to avoid being on \\(y = 4\\) or \\(y = 5\\) at the unsafe turn \\(T = 14\\). It also includes a stay action at turn 17 to avoid being on \\(y = 7\\) or \\(y = 8\\) during their unsafe periods, specifically at \\(T = 18\\). The player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn \\(21 = t_1 + H - 1 = 12 + 10 - 1\\).\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n\n- At turn 12, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 13 (safe, as \\(y = 4\\) at \\(T = 13\\) has car span \\([12, 47]\\), excluding 0).\n- At turn 13, action \\(D\\) moves to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 14 (to avoid being on \\(y = 4\\) or \\(y = 5\\) at \\(T = 14\\)).\n- At turn 14, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 15 (safe, as \\(y = 4\\) at \\(T = 15\\) has car span \\([-60, -25]\\), excluding 0).\n- At turn 15, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 16 (safe, as \\(y = 5\\) at \\(T = 16\\) has car span \\([-96, -61]\\), excluding 0).\n- At turn 16, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 17 (safe, as \\(y = 6\\) is always safe).\n- At turn 17, action \\(S\\) stays at \\(y = 6\\) at turn 18 (to avoid moving to \\(y = 7\\) at the unsafe \\(T = 18\\)).\n- At turn 18, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 19 (safe, as \\(y = 7\\) at \\(T = 19\\) has car spans \\([1, 12]\\) and \\([65, 76]\\), excluding 0).\n- At turn 19, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 20 (safe, as \\(y = 8\\) at \\(T = 20\\) has car span \\([1, 12]\\), excluding 0).\n- At turn 20, action \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 21, reaching the goal.\n\nAll actions ensure no collision occurs, as verified for each turn and freeway.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,4) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 13, and I start at y=4.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movements and when collisions happen. The player moves vertically, and cars move horizontally on their freeways. Collision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y=k, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn T.\n\nThe note says that if I move to a different y at turn T, I'm not considered on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, I'm on y_T, and if I move, at turn T+1 I'm on y_{T+1}.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9, which is not a freeway, so no cars there. Freeways are y=1 to y=8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, since no cars there. But I start at y=4, which is a freeway, so I need to be careful there too.\n\nNow, let's list all the cars for each freeway at turn t_1=13.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, head 0, tail -47, direction right, speed 48. Since direction is right, head should be greater than tail? The span is given as (head, tail), but for right-moving, it says span(t_1) = [τ, h] for right? Let me read carefully.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nFor left-moving: span(t_1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nFor right-moving: span(t_1) = [τ, h] → span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the input, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). I think head and tail are defined such that for left-moving, head is the front, so for left, head > tail? And for right, head is also the front, so for right, head > tail as well? But in the notation, for right-moving, it says span(t_1) = [τ, h], which might imply τ < h.\n\nLook at freeway 1: (head=0, tail=-47, direction=right, speed=48)\n\nSince direction right, and head=0, tail=-47, so τ = tail = -47, h = head = 0, so span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-47, 0]? But in the input it's given as (head, tail), so (0, -47) meaning head=0, tail=-47.\n\nFor right-moving, span is [τ, h] with τ < h, I assume. Here τ=-47, h=0, so span at t_1 is [-47, 0].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, like freeway 4: (12,47,left,36), head=12, tail=47? But for left-moving, head should be the left end? I'm confused.\n\nLet me read the update rules.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nIf it's moving left, decreasing x, so if [h, τ] at t_1, with h and τ such that h < τ? Or h > τ?\n\nTypically, if moving left, the head is at smaller x, tail at larger x.\n\nIn freeway 4: (head=12, tail=47, left, 36). Head=12, tail=47, so if moving left, head should be the left end, but 12 < 47, so if moving left, at t_1, head is at x=12, tail at x=47? But then as it moves left, both decrease.\n\nSpan(T) = [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so if s>0, moving left, x decreases.\n\nSimilarly for right: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], x increases.\n\nNow, the span is a set of x-coordinates, and collision if 0 is in the span at turn T when player is on that freeway.\n\nFor freeway 1 at t_1=13: car is right-moving, head=0, tail=-47, so τ = tail = -47, h = head = 0, so span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-47, 0]? But [τ, h] with τ=-47, h=0, so it's from -47 to 0 inclusive? I think so.\n\nThen at time T, span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-47 + 48(T-13), 0 + 48(T-13)] = [48(T-13) -47, 48(T-13)]\n\nSimilarly, for other cars.\n\nBut for collision, we care about when 0 is in span(T) for some car on freeway y at turn T.\n\nAlso, since the player moves at the same time, but the car positions are updated based on time, not on player actions.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=4 at turn t_1=13.\n\nI need to go to y=9, which is above, so I probably want to move up as much as possible, but I have to avoid the freeways when cars are at x=0.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway, the times when there is a car such that 0 is in its span, meaning that if I am on that freeway at that turn, I collide.\n\nSince there might be multiple cars per freeway, I need to find for each freeway, the set of turns T where for some car on that freeway, 0 ∈ span(T).\n\nThen, for the player, when moving, at each turn T, if I am on y_T = k (freeway), and at that T, there is a car on k with 0 in span, I collide.\n\nIf I am not on a freeway, no collision.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so safe.\n\nNow, at turn T, I am on y_T, which is the position after action at T-1 or something? Let's see the update.\n\nPlayer: at turn t, position (0, y_t)\n\nAction a_t determines Δy_t, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo at turn t, player is at y_t, and after action a_t, moves to y_{t+1} for turn t+1.\n\nBut for collision, it says: collision occurs at turn T if for any car on freeway y_T, 0 ∈ span(T).\n\ny_T is the position at turn T.\n\nSo at turn T, I am at y_T, and if y_T is a freeway (1-8), and for that row, at time T, there is a car with 0 in its span, I collide.\n\nThe note: if I move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, I am not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so I won't be collided by cars on y_{T+1} at turn T, even if 0 is in span at T for that freeway, because I'm not there yet.\n\nSimilarly, when I leave a freeway, I might avoid collision if the car is there at the turn I leave.\n\nBut at the turn I arrive, if I arrive at a freeway and at that turn, 0 is in span for that row, I collide.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nSuppose at turn T, I am at y_T = k.\n\nThen, if k is freeway, and at time T, there is a car on freeway k with 0 in span(T), I collide.\n\nIf I take action a_T to move to y_{T+1} = m ≠ k.\n\nThen at turn T, I was on k, so I could collide if k is freeway and car at 0 at T.\n\nAt turn T+1, I am on m, so if m is freeway, and at T+1, car at 0, I collide.\n\nThe action happens at turn t, but the position is for the turn.\n\nLet's think of the sequence.\n\nStart at turn t_1 = 13, position y_{13} = 4.\n\nI take action a_{13}, which determines y_{14} = y_{13} + Δy_{13}, and so on.\n\nAt each turn t, I am at y_t, and I take action a_t to go to y_{t+1}.\n\nFor collision at turn t: if y_t is between 1 and 8, and for freeway y_t, at time t, there is a car with 0 in span(t), then collision.\n\nTime t is the turn number.\n\nCars are updated based on t, not on player.\n\nFor each freeway, I need to find for which t, there is a car such that 0 ∈ span(t).\n\nThen, when the player is on that freeway at that t, collision.\n\nNow, since I start at t=13, and I need to go to y=9, which is 5 steps up from y=4, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid collisions, but since I want min turns, probably go up directly if possible, but I have to check the collision times.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway the times when it is occupied at x=0, meaning 0 in some car's span.\n\nLet Δt = t - 13, so at t=13, Δt=0.\n\nFor each car, find when 0 ∈ span(t).\n\nspan(t) depends on t.\n\nStart with freeway 1: only one car, right-moving, head=0, tail=-47, speed=48.\n\nAt t_1=13, span = [τ, h] = [-47, 0] for right-moving? Earlier I said [τ, h] with τ = tail = -47, h = head = 0.\n\nGeneral: for right-moving, span(t) = [τ + s(t - t_1), h + s(t - t_1)] = [-47 + 48(t-13), 0 + 48(t-13)] = [48(t-13) -47, 48(t-13)]\n\n0 is in span(t) if 48(t-13) -47 ≤ 0 ≤ 48(t-13)\n\nSince 48(t-13) -47 ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 48(t-13)\n\nFrom 0 ≤ 48(t-13), so t-13 ≥ 0, t ≥ 13\n\nFrom 48(t-13) -47 ≤ 0, 48(t-13) ≤ 47, t-13 ≤ 47/48 <1, so t-13 =0, since t integer.\n\nt-13 ≤ 47/48, so since t integer, t-13 <= 0? 47/48 <1, so t-13 <= 0, but t>=13 from above.\n\n0 ≤ 48(Δt) and 48(Δt) -47 ≤ 0\n\nSo 48(Δt) ≤ 47 and 0 ≤ 48(Δt)\n\nSince 48(Δt) >=0, always true for Δt >=0.\n\n48(Δt) <=47, so Δt <= 47/48 <1, so Δt =0.\n\nThus at t=13 only, 0 ∈ span for freeway 1.\n\nAt t=13, span is [48(0)-47, 48(0)] = [-47, 0], so yes, 0 is included.\n\nAt t=14, span [48(1)-47, 48(1)] = [48-47, 48] = [1,48], 0 not in, etc.\n\nSo freeway 1 has a car at x=0 only at t=13.\n\nBut t=13 is current turn, and player is at y=4, not on freeway 1, so no issue for freeway 1, except if I go to y=1 at some point.\n\nNow freeway 2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: head=-36, tail=-47? Input: (-36, -47, right, 12)\n\nSo head=-36, tail=-47, direction right, speed 12.\n\nSince right-moving, τ = tail = -47, h = head = -36\n\nspan(t) = [τ + s(t-13), h + s(t-13)] = [-47 + 12(t-13), -36 + 12(t-13)]\n\n0 in span if -47 +12(Δt) ≤ 0 ≤ -36 +12(Δt)\n\nSimilarly, second car: (36, 25, right, 12), head=36, tail=25? tail=25, head=36, direction right.\n\nτ = tail =25, h = head=36\n\nspan(t) = [25 +12(Δt), 36 +12(Δt)]\n\nNow for first car: 0 ∈ span(t) if -47 +12(Δt) ≤ 0 ≤ -36 +12(Δt)\n\nWhich is 12(Δt) ≤ 47 and 0 ≤ -36 +12(Δt), so 12(Δt) >=36, Δt >=3\n\nAnd 12(Δt) <=47, Δt <= 47/12 = 3.916, so Δt=3 or Δt=4? Δt integer.\n\n12(Δt) <=47, Δt <=3 since 12*3=36<47, 12*4=48>47? Let's see inequalities.\n\nFrom -47 +12(Δt) <= 0 <= -36 +12(Δt)\n\nLeft: -47 +12(Δt) <=0 => 12(Δt) <=47 => Δt <= 47/12 ≈3.916, so Δt <=3 since integer? 12*3=36, 36<=47, yes; 12*4=48>47, not <=47.\n\n12(Δt) <=47, so for Δt=0,12*0=0<=47; Δt=1,12<=47; Δt=2,24<=47; Δt=3,36<=47; Δt=4,48>47, not <=47. So Δt <=3.\n\nBut also right inequality: 0 <= -36 +12(Δt) => 12(Δt) >=36 => Δt >=3.\n\nSo only when Δt=3, both satisfied: 12*3=36, so -47+36= -11 <=0? -11 <=0 true, 0 <= -36+36=0 true, so 0 in span.\n\nAt Δt=3, t=16, span [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0], so 0 included.\n\nAt other times? For example Δt=4, -47+48=1 <=0? 1 <=0 false, so left inequality not hold.\n\nSimilarly, Δt=2, -47+24= -23 <=0 true, but 0 <= -36+24= -12? 0 <= -12 false, so not.\n\nOnly Δt=3 for first car.\n\nNow second car on freeway 2: (36,25,right,12), τ=25, h=36\n\nspan(t) = [25 +12(Δt), 36 +12(Δt)]\n\n0 in span if 25+12(Δt) <= 0 <= 36+12(Δt)\n\nBut 25+12(Δt) >=25 >0 for Δt>=0, so left part 25+12(Δt) <=0 impossible since min at Δt=0 is 25>0. So never <=0, so 0 never in span for second car.\n\nThus for freeway 2, only at t=13 +3 =16, the first car has 0 in span, so occupied at t=16.\n\nt=16.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? Input: for freeway 3, also two cars: (-36,-47,right,12) and (36,25,right,12), same as freeway 2.\n\nSo similarly, only at t=16, occupied by first car.\n\nNow freeway 4: (12,47,left,36)\n\nLeft-moving, head=12, tail=47, speed=36.\n\nFor left-moving, span(t_1) = [h, τ] = [12,47]? But [h,τ] with h=12, τ=47, so from 12 to 47.\n\nThen span(t) = [h - s(Δt), τ - s(Δt)] = [12 - 36(Δt), 47 - 36(Δt)]\n\n0 in span if 12 - 36(Δt) <= 0 <= 47 - 36(Δt)\n\nLeft: 12 -36(Δt) <=0 => 12 <=36(Δt) => Δt >= 12/36 = 1/3, so Δt >=1\n\nRight: 0 <= 47 -36(Δt) => 36(Δt) <=47 => Δt <= 47/36 ≈1.305, so Δt <=1\n\nThus Δt=1, t=14\n\nAt Δt=1, span [12-36,47-36] = [-24,11], so 0 between -24 and 11, yes included.\n\nAt other times, no.\n\nSo freeway 4 occupied only at t=14.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 4? Input: (12,47,left,36), same, so occupied only at t=14.\n\nNow freeway 6: (30,19,right,6)\n\nHead=30, tail=19, direction right, speed 6.\n\nSince right, τ = tail =19, h = head=30\n\nspan(t) = [19 +6(Δt), 30 +6(Δt)]\n\n0 in span if 19+6(Δt) <=0 <=30+6(Δt)\n\nBut 19+6(Δt) >=19>0 for Δt>=0, so never <=0, so 0 never in span. Freeway 6 never occupied at x=0.\n\nNow freeway 7: two cars.\n\nFirst: (-12,-23,right,4)\n\nHead=-12, tail=-23, direction right, speed 4.\n\nτ = tail = -23, h = head = -12\n\nspan(t) = [-23 +4(Δt), -12 +4(Δt)]\n\n0 in span if -23 +4(Δt) <=0 <= -12 +4(Δt)\n\nLeft: -23 +4(Δt) <=0 => 4(Δt) <=23 => Δt <= 23/4 = 5.75, so Δt <=5\n\nRight: 0 <= -12 +4(Δt) => 4(Δt) >=12 => Δt >=3\n\nSo Δt from 3 to 5 inclusive, t=16,17,18\n\nAt Δt=3, span [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nΔt=4, [-23+16, -12+16] = [-7,4], 0 in\n\nΔt=5, [-23+20, -12+20] = [-3,8], 0 in\n\nΔt=6, [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSecond car on freeway 7: (52,41,right,4)\n\nHead=52, tail=41, direction right, speed 4.\n\nτ=41, h=52\n\nspan(t) = [41+4(Δt), 52+4(Δt)] >=41>0, so never <=0, 0 never in span.\n\nThus freeway 7 occupied at t=16,17,18 by the first car.\n\nt=13 + Δt, Δt=3,4,5 so t=16,17,18.\n\nNow freeway 8: (-9,-20,right,3)\n\nHead=-9, tail=-20, direction right, speed 3.\n\nτ = tail = -20, h = head = -9\n\nspan(t) = [-20 +3(Δt), -9 +3(Δt)]\n\n0 in span if -20 +3(Δt) <=0 <= -9 +3(Δt)\n\nLeft: -20 +3(Δt) <=0 => 3(Δt) <=20 => Δt <= 20/3 ≈6.666, so Δt <=6\n\nRight: 0 <= -9 +3(Δt) => 3(Δt) >=9 => Δt >=3\n\nSo Δt from 3 to 6 inclusive, t=16,17,18,19\n\nAt Δt=3, [-20+9, -9+9] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nΔt=4, [-20+12, -9+12] = [-8,3], 0 in\n\nΔt=5, [-20+15, -9+15] = [-5,6], 0 in\n\nΔt=6, [-20+18, -9+18] = [-2,9], 0 in\n\nΔt=7, [-20+21, -9+21] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo freeway 8 occupied at t=16,17,18,19.\n\nNow, summarize the dangerous times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: occupied only at t=13\n\n- y=2: occupied at t=16\n\n- y=3: occupied at t=16\n\n- y=4: occupied at t=14\n\n- y=5: occupied at t=14\n\n- y=6: never occupied\n\n- y=7: occupied at t=16,17,18\n\n- y=8: occupied at t=16,17,18,19\n\nPlayer starts at t=13, y=4.\n\nAt t=13, y=4, and freeway 4 is occupied at t=14? At t=13, is freeway 4 occupied?\n\nFor y=4, occupied at t=14, not at t=13.\n\nAt t=13, player is at y=4.\n\nIs freeway 4 occupied at t=13?\n\nFrom above, for freeway 4, we have occupation only at t=14.\n\nSimilarly, at t=13, for freeway 4, no car at x=0, since only at t=14.\n\nConfirm: freeway 4 car: at t=13, Δt=0, span [12,47] for left-moving? Earlier: span at t_1=13 is [h,τ] = [12,47], so x from 12 to 47, 0 not in, so at t=13, freeway 4 is safe.\n\nPlayer is at y=4 at t=13, and no car at x=0, so no collision.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is above, so I should move up.\n\nBut I have to avoid being on dangerous freeways at dangerous times.\n\nThe dangerous times are:\n\n- y=4 at t=14\n\n- y=5 at t=14\n\n- y=2 at t=16\n\n- y=3 at t=16\n\n- y=7 at t=16,17,18\n\n- y=8 at t=16,17,18,19\n\ny=6 is always safe.\n\nI start at t=13, y=4.\n\nAt t=13, I am at y=4, safe.\n\nI take action a_{13} to go to y_{14}.\n\ny_{14} = y_{13} + Δy, which is 4 + a_{13}, a_{13} in {U,D,S}, so Δy = +1, -1, 0.\n\nI want to go to y=9, so I should move up if possible.\n\nBut at t=14, if I am on y=4 or y=5, I will collide, because y=4 and y=5 are occupied at t=14.\n\ny=4 occupied at t=14, y=5 at t=14.\n\nIf at t=14, I am on y=4 or y=5, collision.\n\nTo avoid that, I need to not be on y=4 or y=5 at t=14.\n\nAt t=14, position y_{14}.\n\ny_{14} is the position after action at t=13.\n\nSo if I stay at y=4, a_{13}=S, then y_{14}=4, at t=14 on y=4, collide.\n\nIf I move up to y=5, a_{13}=U, y_{14}=5, at t=14 on y=5, collide.\n\nIf I move down to y=3, a_{13}=D, y_{14}=3, then at t=14, on y=3.\n\ny=3 is freeway, at t=14, is it occupied? From above, y=3 occupied only at t=16, not at t=14, so should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 at t=14: y=2 occupied only at t=16, so safe.\n\ny=1 at t=14: occupied only at t=13, not at t=14, so safe.\n\ny=6 at t=14: always safe.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nOptions at t=13:\n\n- If I go down to y=3, then at t=14, I am at y=3, safe.\n\nThen I can move up later.\n\nBut I need to avoid the dangerous times.\n\nSince I need to go to y=9, which is 5 above, min turns is 5 if I go up directly, but at t=14, I must not be on y=4 or y=5.\n\nAt t=13, I can move down to y=3 or up to y=5 but that causes collision, or stay same.\n\nMoving down to y=3 seems possible.\n\nThen from there, I need to go up to y=9.\n\nBut there are dangerous times later.\n\nList the dangerous positions and times:\n\n- At t=14: y=4 and y=5 dangerous\n\n- At t=16: y=2, y=3, y=7 dangerous (also y=7 from t=16 to 18, but specifically at t=16)\n\n- t=16: y=2,3,7\n\n- t=17: y=7,8? y=7 at t=17,18; y=8 at t=16-19\n\nBut y=6 is always safe.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince min turns, I want to go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut at t=14, I cannot be on y=4 or 5, so I must leave y=4 before t=14? At t=13 I am on y=4, but at t=14 I need not to be on y=4 or 5.\n\nSo at t=13, I must take action to not be on y=4 or 5 at t=14.\n\nPossible actions: go down to y=3, or go up to y=5 but that causes collision at t=14, or stay y=4 collision.\n\nSo only safe is to go down to y=3.\n\na_{13} = D, so y_{14} = 3.\n\nThen at t=14, I am at y=3, which is safe, since no car at x=0 for y=3 at t=14.\n\nNow, at t=14, I need to take action a_{14} to go to y_{15}.\n\nNow, I can move up, down, or stay.\n\nIf I move up to y=4, a_{14}=U, then y_{15}=4.\n\nAt t=15, I am on y=4.\n\nIs y=4 dangerous at t=15? From above, y=4 only dangerous at t=14, not at t=15, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay at y=3, or move down, but I want to go up.\n\nMove up to y=4.\n\nThen y_{15} =4 at t=15.\n\nSafe.\n\nNow at t=15, I am at y=4, take action a_{15} to go to y_{16}.\n\ny_{16} could be 3,4, or 5.\n\nBut at t=16, y=2,3,7 are dangerous.\n\ny=4 at t=16: is it dangerous? y=4 only dangerous at t=14, not at t=16, so safe.\n\ny=5 at t=16: y=5 only dangerous at t=14, not later, so safe.\n\ny=6 safe.\n\nBut y=2,3,7 dangerous at t=16.\n\nSo if at t=16, I am on y=4,5,6, should be safe.\n\ny=4 is freeway, but not occupied at t=16, similarly y=5.\n\nNow, from y=4 at t=15, I can move up to y=5, a_{15}=U, then y_{16}=5.\n\nAt t=16, on y=5, safe.\n\nThen I need to go to y=9.\n\ny=5 to y=9 is 4 steps, but I have to go through y=6,7,8.\n\ny=6 always safe.\n\ny=7 dangerous at t=16,17,18.\n\ny=8 dangerous at t=16,17,18,19.\n\nIf I go directly up, from t=16 on y=5, I can go to y=6 at t=17, but let's see.\n\nAt t=16, I am at y=5 (if I go up).\n\nSet timeline.\n\nt=13: start y=4\n\na_{13}=D, so y_{14}=3\n\nt=14: at y=3, take action, say U to y=4? Or directly to y=4? y_{15}\n\na_{14}=U, so y_{15}=4\n\nt=15: at y=4, take action, say U to y=5, a_{15}=U, y_{16}=5\n\nt=16: at y=5, now t=16, y=5 is safe, as established.\n\nNow, I need to go up to y=6.\n\na_{16} could be U to y=6, so y_{17}=6\n\nBut at t=17, y_{17}=6, which is safe, since y=6 always safe.\n\nThen from there, I need to go to y=7, but y=7 is dangerous at t=17.\n\nAt t=17, if I am on y=7, I collide.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=7 at t=17, I am on y=7 at t=17, which is dangerous.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=7 at t=17.\n\nSimilarly, at t=16,18, etc.\n\nNow, from t=16, I am at y=5.\n\nIf I go up to y=6 at t=17, safe.\n\nBut then at t=17, on y=6, I want to go to y=7.\n\nBut if I go to y=7 at t=18, y_{18}=7, then at t=18, I am on y=7, which is dangerous at t=18 (since y=7 occupied t=16,17,18).\n\nSo collide.\n\nIf I stay on y=6 at t=17, then y_{17}=6, safe, but I need to move eventually.\n\nAt t=17, on y=6, I can go up to y=7 at t=18, but same problem.\n\nOr I can go down, but that delays.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 during dangerous times.\n\nDangerous for y=7: t=16,17,18\n\ny=8: t=16,17,18,19\n\nSince I am at y=5 at t=16, I can stay or move.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, but I have to pass through y=7 and y=8.\n\nThe dangerous times for y=7 are t=16,17,18; for y=8 t=16,17,18,19.\n\nThe earliest I can be on y=7 or y=8 without collision.\n\nFor example, y=7 is safe after t=18, i.e., t=19 or later.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 safe after t=19, i.e., t=20 or later.\n\nBut t=19 for y=8: occupied until t=19, so at t=19, dangerous, safe from t=20.\n\nSimilarly y=7 dangerous until t=18, safe from t=19.\n\nNow, at t=16, I am at y=5.\n\nI can go to y=6 at t=17, which is safe.\n\nThen from y=6 at t=17, I can stay on y=6 for some turns, since safe, until it's safe to go to y=7.\n\nBut y=7 safe from t=19.\n\nSo I need to be on y=7 at t=19 or later.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nI can go to y=6 at t=17.\n\nThen at t=17, on y=6, I can stay: a_{17}=S, so y_{18}=6, still on y=6 at t=18.\n\nThen at t=18, take action a_{18}, go up to y=7, so y_{19}=7.\n\nThen at t=19, on y=7.\n\nNow t=19, y=7: is it dangerous? Dangerous times t=16,17,18, so t=19 should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=19, on y=7, I can go up to y=8, a_{18}? No.\n\nAt t=18, I take action to go to y_{19}=7.\n\nThen at t=19, on y=7, take action a_{19}, say U to y=8, so y_{20}=8.\n\nThen at t=20, on y=8.\n\ny=8 dangerous until t=19, so at t=20, should be safe? t=20 >19, yes.\n\nThen at t=20, on y=8, go up to y=9, a_{20}=U, y_{21}=9, reached.\n\nBut at y=21, position at turn t=21, y=9.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9, so at some turn, y_t=9.\n\nIn this case, at t=21, y=9.\n\nBut let's count the turns from start.\n\nStart t=13, y=4.\n\nAfter actions:\n\nt=13: a_{13}=D, y_{14}=3\n\nt=14: a_{14}=U, y_{15}=4\n\nt=15: a_{15}=U, y_{16}=5\n\nt=16: a_{16}=U, y_{17}=6\n\nt=17: a_{17}=S, y_{18}=6  (stay)\n\nt=18: a_{18}=U, y_{19}=7\n\nt=19: a_{19}=U, y_{20}=8\n\nt=20: a_{20}=U, y_{21}=9\n\nSo at t=21, y=9, so H=21-13+1? Turns from t=13 to t=21, that's 9 turns? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t=t_1 to t_1 + H-1, and after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position.\n\nt_1 =13, start position at turn t_1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions a_{t} for t= t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, we reach turn t_1 + H.\n\nIn this case, I have actions from t=13 to t=20, that's 8 actions? t=13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20: 8 actions.\n\nAfter a_{20}, y_{21}=9, so at turn 21, y=9.\n\nH = number of actions =8.\n\nBut is this minimal? I think I can do better.\n\nSince at t=16, I am at y=5, and y=6 is safe, I can go to y=6 at t=17.\n\nBut instead of staying, can I go to y=7 earlier? But y=7 dangerous until t=18.\n\nIf I go to y=7 at t=17, I am on y=7 at t=17, collide.\n\nSimilarly, cannot.\n\nWhat if I go down from y=5 to avoid, but that seems worse.\n\nAnother idea: at t=14, I am at y=3.\n\nInstead of going up immediately, I could stay or go down, but going down might delay.\n\nFor example, at t=14, on y=3, I could stay: a_{14}=S, y_{15}=3.\n\nThen at t=15, on y=3, which is safe? y=3 dangerous only at t=16.\n\nAt t=15, y=3 should be safe.\n\nThen at t=15, I can go up to y=4, a_{15}=U, y_{16}=4.\n\nBut at t=16, on y=4, which is safe, as before.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nAt t=15, if I go up to y=4, y_{16}=4.\n\nAt t=16, I could go directly to y=6? But I have to go through y=5 or something.\n\ny_{16}=4, a_{16} can be U to y=5, or D to y=3, or S.\n\nBut y=5 at t=16 is safe, as before.\n\nThen to y=6.\n\nBut still, I need to wait for y=7.\n\nSince y=6 is always safe, I can go to y=6 earlier and stay there until it's safe to go up.\n\nIn the first sequence, I reached y=6 at t=17.\n\nCan I reach y=6 earlier?\n\nStart t=13, y=4.\n\na_{13}=D to y=3 at t=14.\n\nAt t=14, on y=3, instead of going up, I could go down to y=2? But y=2 might be dangerous later.\n\ny=2 dangerous at t=16.\n\nAt t=14, y=2 is safe.\n\na_{14}=D to y=2, so y_{15}=2.\n\nAt t=15, on y=2, which is safe at t=15, since dangerous only at t=16.\n\nThen at t=15, I can go up to y=3, a_{15}=U, y_{16}=3.\n\nBut at t=16, on y=3, which is dangerous! Because y=3 occupied at t=16.\n\nCollision.\n\nIf at t=15, on y=2, I go to y=3 at t=16, y_{16}=3, on y=3 at t=16, collide.\n\nIf I stay at y=2 at t=15, a_{15}=S, y_{16}=2, then at t=16 on y=2, which is dangerous at t=16, collide.\n\nSo if I go to y=2 at t=15, I cannot be on y=2 at t=16, but since I arrive at t=15, I need to leave before t=16.\n\nBut at t=15, I am on y=2, I can take action to go to y=1 or y=3.\n\nIf go to y=1, a_{15}=D? y from 0 to 9.\n\ny=1 at t=16: y=1 dangerous only at t=13, not later, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 at t=16 dangerous.\n\nSo at t=15, on y=2, I can go down to y=1, a_{15}=D, y_{16}=1.\n\nThen at t=16, on y=1, safe.\n\nThen from there, I need to go up, but y=1 to y=9, far, and I have to pass through dangerous zones, but with delays, might take more turns.\n\nFor example, at t=16, on y=1, go up to y=2, a_{16}=U, y_{17}=2.\n\nBut at t=17, on y=2, which is safe? y=2 dangerous only at t=16, not before or after, so at t=17, safe.\n\nThen to y=3, etc.\n\nBut y=7 and y=8 still dangerous until later.\n\nThis might take even longer.\n\nFor instance:\n\nt=13: a13=D, y14=3\n\nt=14: a14=D, y15=2? Or to y=1? Let's not, since going down delays.\n\nBetter to go up as soon as possible, but avoid the t=14 for y=4,5.\n\nIn the first sequence, I have to wait at y=6 until t=18 to go to y=7 at t=19.\n\nBut t=19 to y=7, then to y=8 at t=20, to y=9 at t=21.\n\nTotal actions from t=13 to t=20: 8 actions.\n\nCan I reach earlier?\n\nAnother idea: since y=6 is safe always, I can go directly to y=6 faster.\n\nBut at t=13, I start at y=4, and I need to avoid t=14 on y=4 or 5.\n\nSo I have to leave y=4 at t=13 to not be there at t=14.\n\nI go down to y=3 at t=14.\n\nThen from y=3 at t=14, I can go to y=4 at t=15? y15=4.\n\nBut y=4 at t=15 is safe.\n\nThen to y=5 at t=16, y16=5, safe at t=16.\n\nNow, instead of going to y=6, can I go directly to y=7? But at t=16, if I go to y=7, y17=7, then at t=17 on y=7, which is dangerous.\n\nCannot.\n\nAt t=16, on y=5, I can go to y=6 at t=17, as before.\n\nBut at t=17 on y=6, I can go to y=7 only if it's safe, but not until t=19.\n\nUnless I can be on y=7 at a safe time.\n\ny=7 safe at t=19 or later.\n\nSimilarly, the car on y=7 is gone after t=18.\n\nt=19 is safe.\n\nBut what about y=8?\n\nI need to go to y=8 after it's safe.\n\nBut perhaps I can go to y=8 directly from y=6 or something, but no, I have to go through y=7.\n\nUnless I skip, but no, y from 0 to 9, so must go through each integer y.\n\nPlayer moves by ±1 or 0, so y changes by at most 1 per turn.\n\nSo must visit intermediate y.\n\nNow, back to y=6.\n\nAt t=17, I am on y=6.\n\nIf I go to y=7 at t=18, y18=7, then at t=18 on y=7, which is dangerous, collide.\n\nSo I cannot go to y=7 at t=18.\n\nI have to go at t=19 or later.\n\nSimilarly, the earliest I can be on y=7 is t=19.\n\nThen on y=7 at t=19, go to y=8 at t=20, on y=8 at t=20 (safe since t=20>19), then to y=9 at t=21.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut from y=6, if I stay longer, it delays more.\n\nCan I reach y=6 earlier?\n\nIn the sequence, I am at y=5 at t=16.\n\nt=16 is after some turns.\n\nStart: t=13 y=4\n\nt=13 action D, y14=3\n\nt=14 action U, y15=4\n\nt=15 action U, y16=5\n\nt=16 action U, y17=6\n\nSo y=6 at t=17.\n\nCould I reach y=6 at an earlier turn?\n\nFor example, if at t=14, on y=3, I go up to y=4 at t=15, same as above.\n\nIf at t=14, on y=3, I go up to y=4 directly? a_{14}=U, y15=4, same.\n\nBut y=5 is only dangerous at t=14, so at t=15, I can be on y=5.\n\nHow to be on y=5 at t=15.\n\nAt t=13, I start at y=4.\n\nIf I could be on y=5 at t=15 instead of t=14.\n\nBut to be on y=5 at t=15, that means at t=14, I was at y=4 or y=5 or y=6 and moved.\n\nBut at t=14, if I am on y=4 or y=5, I collide, so I cannot be on y=4 or y=5 at t=14.\n\nSo at t=14, I must be on y=3 or lower or y=6 or higher.\n\nBut y=6 is possible? How?\n\nFrom t=13, y=4, I can go up to y=5 at t=14, but then collide at t=14.\n\nOr go down to y=3.\n\nCannot go directly to y=6 from y=4 in one step; only to y=3,4,5.\n\nSo impossible to be on y=6 at t=14.\n\nThus, earliest to be on y=6 is t=15 or later.\n\nHow?\n\nFor example, at t=13, go down to y=3 at t=14.\n\nThen at t=14, on y=3, go up to y=4 at t=15.\n\nThen at t=15, on y=4, go up to y=5 at t=16.\n\nAt t=16, on y=5, go up to y=6 at t=17.\n\nSo y=6 at t=17, as before.\n\nAt t=14, on y=3, if I go up to y=4 at t=15, same.\n\nIf at t=14, on y=3, I go down to y=2? But then y=2 at t=15, which is safe, then I can go to y=3 at t=16, but at t=16 on y=3 dangerous, so I cannot.\n\nGo to y=1 or something, but delays.\n\nSo not better.\n\nThus, y=6 at t=17 is earliest possible.\n\nThen from there, I need to go to y=7 at t=19 or later.\n\nSo at t=17, on y=6, I stay or move.\n\nIf I stay at t=17, a_{17}=S, y18=6 at t=18.\n\nThen at t=18, go up to y=7, a_{18}=U, y19=7 at t=19.\n\nThen at t=19, on y=7, go up to y=8, a_{19}=U, y20=8 at t=20.\n\nThen at t=20, on y=8, go up to y=9, a_{20}=U, y21=9.\n\nActions: t=13 to t=20, 8 actions.\n\nH=8 turns of actions.\n\nt_1 + H = 13 + H =21, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, I stayed at y=6 for one turn.\n\nBut I could go down to avoid, but no need.\n\nIs there a way to be on y=7 earlier?\n\ny=7 safe only from t=19.\n\nt=19 is the earliest safe turn for y=7.\n\nSimilarly for y=8, safe from t=20.\n\nBut I can be on y=7 at t=19, then y=8 at t=20, y=9 at t=21.\n\nBut y=8 at t=20 is safe.\n\nNow, what about the car on y=8? Dangerous until t=19, so at t=20 safe.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in this, I reached y=9 at t=21.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=9 earlier if I go faster through lower freeways, but I have to avoid the dangers.\n\nAnother thought: at t=16, I am at y=5.\n\nInstead of going to y=6, I could go down to y=4 or something, but that doesn't help.\n\nOr, since y=6 is safe, I can stay on y=6 for multiple turns, but to minimize, I should go up as soon as possible.\n\nBut I have to wait until t=19 to go to y=7.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=8 directly from y=6? No, cannot, must go to y=7 first.\n\nUnless I move up faster, but no.\n\nAnother idea: at some point, I can be on y=7 or y=8 when it is safe, but I need to arrive at a safe turn.\n\nBut the dangerous period is multiple turns, so I have to wait until after.\n\nNow, for y=8, dangerous until t=19, so safe from t=20.\n\nSimilarly y=7 from t=19.\n\nBut I can be on y=7 at t=19, which is after the danger.\n\nNow, in the sequence above, I am on y=6 at t=17 and t=18.\n\nt=18 is after t=17, but I stay.\n\nCan I avoid staying at y=6?\n\nFor example, if I reach y=6 later, but then I might reach y=7 later.\n\nSuppose at t=17, I am at y=6.\n\nInstead of staying, I could go down to y=5, but y=5 is safe, but then I have to come back, worse.\n\nOr go to y=7 directly, but cannot because dangerous.\n\nSo no, staying is fine.\n\nBut let's see if I can be on y=6 earlier, but I don't think so.\n\nEarlier sequence has y=6 at t=17.\n\nWhat about t=15? How?\n\nTo be at y=6 at t=15.\n\nAt t=15, position y_{15}.\n\ny_{15} comes from y_{14} + action at t=14.\n\ny_{14} from y_{13} + action at t=13.\n\ny_{13}=4.\n\nAt t=13, action: if U, y14=5, but at t=14 on y=5 collide.\n\nIf S, y14=4, collide.\n\nIf D, y14=3.\n\nSo y14=3 at t=14.\n\nThen at t=14, on y=3, action: if U, y15=4; if S, y15=3; if D, y15=2.\n\nNone of these is y=6. Cannot reach y=6 at t=15.\n\nSimilarly, at t=16: y16 from y15 + a15.\n\ny15 could be 2,3,4 as above, so y16 could be 1,2,3,4,5, not 6 directly.\n\nSo earliest y=6 at t=17, as before.\n\nThen, from y=6 at t=17, I need to go to y=7.\n\nBut at t=18, if I go to y=7, I am on y=7 at t=18, dangerous.\n\nAt t=19, I can be on y=7.\n\nSo at t=17, on y=6, I must take action such that at t=18, I am not on y=7, but I can be on y=6 or y=5.\n\nIf I go to y=5, a_{17}=D, y18=5, at t=18 on y=5, safe.\n\nThen at t=18, on y=5, I can go to y=6, a_{18}=U, y19=6, but then I am back to y=6 at t=19, same as before but delayed.\n\nThen go to y=7 at t=20? Worse.\n\nSo better to stay at y=6 at t=18.\n\nThen go to y=7 at t=19.\n\nNow, at t=19, on y=7, go to y=8 at t=20, on y=8 at t=20, safe.\n\nThen to y=9 at t=21.\n\nBut when I go to y=8 at t=20, on y=8 at t=20, which is safe.\n\nBut y=8 is dangerous until t=19, so t=20 safe.\n\nNow, but in this, I have 8 actions.\n\nBut let's list the turns:\n\nt: action, resulting y at next turn\n\nt=13: action a13, y14\n\nt=14: a14, y15\n\n...\n\nAfter a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\n- At t=13: a13 = D, so y14 = 3\n\n- At t=14: a14 = U, so y15 = 4\n\n- At t=15: a15 = U, so y16 = 5\n\n- At t=16: a16 = U, so y17 = 6\n\n- At t=17: a17 = S, so y18 = 6  (stay, since if I go U, y18=7, but at t=18 on y=7 collide)\n\n- At t=18: a18 = U, so y19 = 7\n\n- At t=19: a19 = U, so y20 = 8\n\n- At t=20: a20 = U, so y21 = 9\n\nSo y=9 at t=21.\n\nH=8 actions.\n\nBut the problem is to minimize H, the number of turns, meaning actions.\n\nPerhaps I can have fewer actions by not staying.\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=7 at t=19, but arrive earlier.\n\nBut I need to be on y=6 until t=18.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=8 from y=6, but cannot.\n\nOr, since y=9 is safe, but I have to be on y=8 to go to y=9.\n\ny=8 must be visited.\n\nBut at t=18, if I could be on y=8, but dangerous.\n\nCannot.\n\nPerhaps at t=19, I can be on y=8 directly, but from where? From y=7 or y=9, but y=9 not yet.\n\nSo must go through y=7 or y=9, but y=9 not adjacent except from y=8.\n\ny=8 adjacent to y=7 and y=9.\n\nSo must be on y=7 before y=8 or after, but since moving up, before.\n\nSo sequence must include y=7 and y=8.\n\nNow, to be on y=7 at t=19, I need to be on y=6 at t=18 or y=8 at t=18, but y=8 at t=18 dangerous, so cannot be on y=8 at t=18.\n\nSimilarly, if on y=6 at t=18, I go to y=7 at t=19.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nSo I think 8 actions is necessary.\n\nBut let's confirm the collision avoidance.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nt=13: at y=4, take a13=D, so move to y=3 for t=14.\n\nAt t=13, position y=4, freeway 4, but at t=13, no car at x=0 for y=4, as we said, safe.\n\nThen at t=14, position y=3, freeway 3, at t=14, no car for y=3 at x=0, safe.\n\nThen a14=U, move to y=4 for t=15.\n\nt=15: at y=4, freeway 4, at t=15, no car, safe.\n\na15=U, to y=5 for t=16.\n\nt=16: at y=5, freeway 5, at t=16, no car, safe.\n\na16=U, to y=6 for t=17.\n\nt=17: at y=6, freeway 6, always safe, no car at x=0.\n\na17=S, stay, so y18=6 for t=18.\n\nt=18: at y=6, safe.\n\na18=U, to y=7 for t=19.\n\nt=19: at y=7, freeway 7, at t=19, is there car? y=7 dangerous at t=16,17,18, not at t=19, so safe.\n\na19=U, to y=8 for t=20.\n\nt=20: at y=8, freeway 8, at t=20, dangerous times t=16-19, so t=20 safe.\n\na20=U, to y=9 for t=21, reached.\n\nNow, H=8.\n\nBut is there a sequence with H=7?\n\nSuppose H=7 actions, then y_{13+7}=y_{20}=9.\n\nSo at t=20, y=9.\n\nNow, at t=19, I must be at y=8, and go up.\n\nAt t=19, position y=8, and I take action U to go to y=9 at t=20.\n\nBut at t=19, if I am on y=8, is it safe?\n\ny=8 is dangerous at t=19, because occupied until t=19 inclusive.\n\nAt t=19, for freeway 8, car span: from earlier, at Δt= t-13, at Δt=6, t=19, span [-2,9], 0 in, so yes, occupied at t=19.\n\nSo if at t=19, I am on y=8, I collide.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be on y=8 at t=19.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at t=20, I must be on y=8 at t=19 to go up.\n\nUnless I am on y=9 already at t=19, but then I don't need to go up.\n\nBut I need to reach at t=20.\n\nWith H=7 actions, I reach at t=20.\n\nBut at t=19, I need to be at y=8 to take U to y=9.\n\nBut at t=19, y=8 is dangerous, so collision if I am there.\n\nTherefore, impossible to reach y=9 at t=20, because it requires being on y=8 at t=19, which is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, for earlier, but t=19 is the issue.\n\nPerhaps reach at t=19.\n\nBut to reach at t=19, y_{19}=9, which requires at t=18, I am on y=8 and take U.\n\nAt t=18, on y=8, but y=8 dangerous at t=18, collide.\n\nSimilarly, t=18 unsafe.\n\nt=17: y_{17}=9, need at t=16 on y=8 and U, but at t=16 y=8 dangerous.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo the earliest I can be on y=9 is after the dangerous times.\n\ny=8 safe from t=20, so I can be on y=8 at t=20, then to y=9 at t=21.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 safe from t=19.\n\nSo in the sequence, being on y=7 at t=19, y=8 at t=20, y=9 at t=21 is necessary.\n\nAnd to be on y=7 at t=19, I need to come from y=6 at t=18.\n\nAnd to be on y=6 at t=18, etc.\n\nIn the sequence, I have y=6 at t=17 and t=18, but I could have reached y=6 earlier? No, as before.\n\nAt t=17, y=6, and at t=18, I stay at y=6, then to y=7 at t=19.\n\nI could have been at y=6 at t=18 directly without staying, but I was at t=17.\n\nSince I need to be at y=6 at t=18 to go to y=7 at t=19, and I can be at y=6 at t=17, I have to stay one turn.\n\nIf I can be at y=6 only at t=18, but how?\n\nFor example, later arrival at y=6.\n\nBut if I arrive at y=6 at t=18, then I can go to y=7 at t=19.\n\nBut arriving at y=6 at t=18 might be later than t=17.\n\nFor example, in the sequence, I arrive at y=6 at t=17.\n\nTo arrive at t=18: y_{18}=6.\n\ny_{18} comes from y_{17} + a_{17}.\n\ny_{17} could be y=5,6,7.\n\nBut at t=17, if on y=7, dangerous, collide.\n\nIf on y=5, go U to y=6.\n\nOr on y=6, stay.\n\nBut to have y_{18}=6, I can have from y_{17}=5 with U, or y_{17}=6 with S.\n\nNow, in terms of reaching, if I arrive at y=6 at t=18, same as staying, but I might have started later.\n\nFor example, suppose I delay going up earlier.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nStart t=13 y=4\n\na13=D, y14=3\n\nNow, at t=14, on y=3, instead of going up, I stay: a14=S, y15=3\n\nt=15: on y=3, a15=U, y16=4\n\nt=16: on y=4, a16=U, y17=5\n\nt=17: on y=5, a17=U, y18=6\n\nt=18: on y=6, a18=U, y19=7\n\nBut at t=19 on y=7, safe? t=19, y=7 safe.\n\nThen a19=U, y20=8\n\nt=20: on y=8, safe, a20=U, y21=9\n\nSame as before, but I arrived at y=6 later, at t=18, and no stay, but I used one more action to stay earlier? Let's count actions.\n\nt=13: a13=D\n\nt=14: a14=S (stay at y=3)\n\nt=15: a15=U to y=4\n\nt=16: a16=U to y=5\n\nt=17: a17=U to y=6\n\nt=18: a18=U to y=7\n\nt=19: a19=U to y=8\n\nt=20: a20=U to y=9\n\ny21=9, same H=8.\n\nBut I reached y=9 same turn.\n\nIn the first sequence, I had a stay at t=17, but same number of actions.\n\nIn this, I didn't have the stay, but I stayed at t=14 instead.\n\nNo gain.\n\nTo minimize H, I need the fewest actions to reach.\n\nBut in both cases H=8.\n\nCan I reach with H=7? We saw not, because of y=8 at t=19 unsafe.\n\nPerhaps reach y=9 at t=19.\n\nThen need at t=18 on y=8 and U.\n\nBut at t=18 on y=8, dangerous, collide.\n\nSimilarly impossible until t=21.\n\nt=21 is the earliest possible to be at y=9.\n\nBecause at t=20, I can be at y=8, safe, and go to y=9.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at t=20, I need to come from y=7 at t=19 with U.\n\nAt t=19, on y=7, safe, go to y=8.\n\nThen at t=20, on y=8, go to y=9.\n\nSo y=9 at t=21.\n\nNow, to be at y=7 at t=19, need from y=6 at t=18 with U.\n\nAt t=18, on y=6, go to y=7.\n\nThen at t=19, on y=7.\n\nNow, to be at y=6 at t=18.\n\ny=6 at t=18 can be from y=5 at t=17 with U, or y=6 at t=17 with S, or y=7 but dangerous.\n\nNow, earliest y=6: we can have at t=17, as before.\n\nThen at t=17, on y=6, to be at y=6 at t=18, I need to stay or come from elsewhere.\n\nBut if at t=17, I am on y=6, and I take S, then y18=6.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nIf I can be at y=6 at t=18 directly, but I need to be there.\n\nFor example, if I go slower earlier, I might arrive at y=6 at t=18.\n\nFor instance: start t=13 y=4\n\na13=D, y14=3\n\na14=U, y15=4\n\na15=U, y16=5\n\na16=S, stay at y=5? But not necessary.\n\na16=U, y17=6\n\nThen at t=17, on y=6, to have y18=6, I take a17=S.\n\nThen a18=U to y19=7, etc.\n\nSame as first sequence.\n\nIf I do a16=S at t=16, y17=5, then at t=17 on y=5, a17=U to y18=6, then at t=18 on y=6, a18=U to y19=7, same.\n\nBut y=6 at t=18.\n\nThen to y=7 at t=19.\n\nNo difference.\n\nThus, minimal H is 8.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I need to output the actions.\n\nIn the first sequence I had:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = D\n\nTurn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1} = U\n\n...\n\nt_1=13.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 13: D\n\nTurn 14: U  (to y=4 at t=15? Let's list with the action and the position after.\n\nPerhaps output the actions.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t: a_t\n\nThen for each turn, the action.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\n- At turn 13: action a13 = D (since we are at turn t, and take action a_t)\n\nAfter a_t, position changes to y_{t+1}.\n\nBut for the sequence, we list a_t for t from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nHere t_1=13, H=8, so t from 13 to 20.\n\nActions:\n\nt=13: D\n\nt=14: U\n\nt=15: U\n\nt=16: U\n\nt=17: S  (stay)\n\nt=18: U\n\nt=19: U\n\nt=20: U\n\nThen y_{21}=9.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=17, I have S, which is stay.\n\nBut I could have a different path, but same H.\n\nFor example, at t=16, I am at y=5, instead of going up, I stay: a16=S, y17=5\n\nThen at t=17, on y=5, go U to y=6, a17=U, y18=6\n\nThen at t=18, on y=6, go U to y=7, but cannot at t=18 to y=7, because at t=19 on y=7, but to go to y=7, a18=U, y19=7.\n\nThen same.\n\nBut at t=18, I go to y=7 at t=19.\n\nBut in this case, actions:\n\nt=13: D\n\nt=14: U\n\nt=15: U\n\nt=16: S  (stay at y=5)\n\nt=17: U  (to y=6)\n\nt=18: U  (to y=7)\n\nt=19: U  (to y=8)\n\nt=20: U  (to y=9)\n\nSame actions, but at t=16 I stayed instead of at t=17.\n\nBut same number.\n\nIn terms of the sequence, either is fine.\n\nBut in the first one, I stayed at y=6, which might be slightly better since y=6 is always safe, but no difference.\n\nNow, I think H=8 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can reach faster by going through y=0 or something, but that would take more steps.\n\nFor example, go down to y=0, then up, but more actions.\n\nSo not better.\n\nThus, minimal H=8.\n\nNow for the sequence, I need to output.\n\nAlso, in the beginning, I have to avoid y=4 and y=5 at t=14, which I did by going down.\n\nNow, output the actions.\n\nThe answer should be:\n\nTurn 13: D\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: S  (or at t=16 S, but let's use the first)\n\nIn the output, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nAnd t_1=13.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{l} \\text{Turn } 13: \\text{D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: \\text{S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: \\text{U} \\end{array} }\n\nBut in this, at turn 17: S, which is stay, so position stays y=6 for t=18.\n\nThen turn 18: U to y=7 at t=19.\n\nYes.\n\nTo avoid the stay, but I have to have a turn where I don't move up, but in this case, since I need to wait, it's fine.\n\nAnother sequence: suppose at turn 16, I go down to y=4? But not useful.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n\nBut in the output, it should be minimal H, and sequence.\n\nPerhaps I can have a sequence with no stay, but same H.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 13: D  (to y=3)\n\nTurn 14: U  (to y=4)\n\nTurn 15: U  (to y=5)\n\nTurn 16: S  (stay at y=5)  // but at t=16 on y=5 safe\n\nThen Turn 17: U  (to y=6)\n\nTurn 18: U  (to y=7) // but a18=U, y19=7, at t=19 on y=7\n\nTurn 19: U  (to y=8)\n\nTurn 20: U  (to y=9)\n\nSame actions: D,U,U,S,U,U,U,U\n\nH=8.\n\nIn this, I stayed at y=5 instead of y=6.\n\nBut same.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 17: in first it was S at y=6, here S at y=5.\n\nBut in both, we have a stay.\n\nBut since y=6 is safer, but no issue.\n\nI think either is ok.\n\nI'll go with the first one.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 13: D\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: S\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nNow, in the box.\n\nBut let's write the turns.\n\nt_1=13, so Turn 13, Turn 14, ..., Turn 20.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the answer.\n</think>\nTo reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 13\\) with the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), the sequence of actions must avoid collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at the times when those freeways are occupied at \\(x = 0\\).\n\nThe dangerous times for each freeway, derived from the car states and update rules, are:\n- \\(y = 1\\): occupied at \\(t = 13\\)\n- \\(y = 2\\): occupied at \\(t = 16\\)\n- \\(y = 3\\): occupied at \\(t = 16\\)\n- \\(y = 4\\): occupied at \\(t = 14\\)\n- \\(y = 5\\): occupied at \\(t = 14\\)\n- \\(y = 6\\): never occupied\n- \\(y = 7\\): occupied at \\(t = 16, 17, 18\\)\n- \\(y = 8\\): occupied at \\(t = 16, 17, 18, 19\\)\n\nThe player starts at \\(y = 4\\) at \\(t = 13\\). Since \\(y = 4\\) is safe at \\(t = 13\\) but dangerous at \\(t = 14\\), the player must move down to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 13 to avoid being on \\(y = 4\\) or \\(y = 5\\) at \\(t = 14\\).\n\nFrom \\(y = 3\\) at \\(t = 14\\), the player moves up to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 14, then to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 15, and to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 16. Freeway \\(y = 6\\) is always safe, so the player stays at \\(y = 6\\) at turn 17 to avoid moving to \\(y = 7\\) during its dangerous period (\\(t = 16, 17, 18\\)).\n\nAt turn 18, the player moves up to \\(y = 7\\), arriving at \\(t = 19\\) when \\(y = 7\\) is safe. Then, the player moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 19 (safe at \\(t = 20\\)) and finally to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 20.\n\nThis sequence requires 8 actions (\\(H = 8\\)) and reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 21.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n- Turn 13: Move down (D) to avoid being on \\(y = 4\\) or \\(y = 5\\) at \\(t = 14\\).\n- Turn 14: Move up (U) to \\(y = 4\\).\n- Turn 15: Move up (U) to \\(y = 5\\).\n- Turn 16: Move up (U) to \\(y = 6\\).\n- Turn 17: Stay (S) at \\(y = 6\\) to wait until \\(y = 7\\) is safe.\n- Turn 18: Move up (U) to \\(y = 7\\).\n- Turn 19: Move up (U) to \\(y = 8\\).\n- Turn 20: Move up (U) to \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThis sequence minimizes \\(H\\) while avoiding all collisions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{l} \\text{Turn } 13: \\text{D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: \\text{S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: \\text{U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: \\text{U} \\end{array} }",

The current turn is t=14, and I start at y=3.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. Each car has a head, tail, direction, and speed. The direction tells us if it's left-moving or right-moving. From the update rules:\n\n- For left-moving cars: span at time T is [h - s(T - t1), τ - s(T - t1)]? Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says for left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the notation, it says \"head is at h, tail is at τ\". For left-moving, if it's moving left, the head should be on the right, decreasing. But here Span(t1) = [h, τ], and since it's left-moving, h should be greater than τ? Let's see the example.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nThis is confusing. Let me parse the notation.\n\nIt says: \"for car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail is at τ at turn t1\"\n\nHead and tail: I think for left-moving cars, head is the front when moving left, so higher x, and tail is lower x. But when it moves left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, head is front when moving right, so lower x if it's starting, but let's see the update.\n\nFor left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, both head and tail decrease by s per turn relative to t1.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h], so τ is the left end, h is the right end? But it says \"head is at h, tail is at τ\", so for right-moving, head should be the front, which is the right end, so h should be greater than τ.\n\nIn the span, for right-moving, it's given as [τ, h], so τ is tail (left), h is head (right).\n\nThen at time T, it becomes [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)], which makes sense, both increase.\n\nFor left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ], but if h is head and it's left-moving, head should be on the left? No.\n\nLet's read: \"left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ]\"\n\nBut if it's left-moving, and head is at h, tail at τ, if it's moving left, head should have higher x, tail lower x, so [h, τ] with h > τ, but [h, τ] might imply h < τ if it's an interval, but in math, [a,b] usually a <= b.\n\nI think there's inconsistency in notation.\n\nLook at the car state given:\n\nFor freeway 1: (48, 1, right, 48) — head 48, tail 1, direction right, speed 48.\n\nSpan(t1) for right-moving is [τ, h] = [1,48], which is from x=1 to x=48.\n\nThen at T, it becomes [1 + s(T-t1), 48 + s(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, say freeway 4: (-24, 11, left, 36)\n\nSpan(t1) = [h, τ] = [-24, 11], but -24 < 11, so [ -24, 11], but if left-moving, moving left, head should be at higher x? Here h=-24, τ=11, so h < τ, so head is at left? But left-moving, moving to decreasing x, so if head is at -24, which is left, and moving left, it should be decreasing, but -24 is smaller, moving left means decreasing x, so from x=11 to x=-24? That doesn't make sense because 11 to -24 is moving left, but head at -24, tail at 11? If it's moving left, the front should be at higher x initially.\n\nI think I have confusion about what \"head\" means.\n\nPerhaps \"head\" is the leading end when moving, so for left-moving, head is the leftmost point? But left-moving means moving to decreasing x, so the leading end is the one with smaller x? Let's think.\n\nAssume x-axis with positive to the right.\n\n- Left-moving: moving to decreasing x, so the front of the car is at the left, with smaller x. So at time t, head is at min x, tail at max x? But in the span, it's given as [h, τ] for left-moving, but in the example, for freeway 4: (-24, 11, left, 36), so h=-24, τ=11, and since left-moving, at t1, span is [h, τ] = [-24, 11], which is from x=-24 to x=11, so head at x=-24 (left), tail at x=11 (right), but since moving left, the head (front) is at left, so at smaller x.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, freeway 1: (48,1,right,48), head h=48, tail τ=1, but for right-moving, span is [τ, h] = [1,48], so tail at left (x=1), head at right (x=48), which makes sense for right-moving.\n\nIn the notation, for left-moving, it's (h, τ, d, s) with span [h, τ], and h is head, which for left-moving is the left end, smaller x.\n\nFor right-moving, (h, τ, d, s) but span is [τ, h], so head is the right end, larger x.\n\nThe way it's written: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nThen for left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nIn freeway 4 example: h=-24, τ=11, left, so at t1, [ -24, 11]\n\nAt time T, [ -24 - 36(T-t1), 11 - 36(T-t1) ]\n\nSince moving left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nFreeway 1: τ=1, h=48, s=48, so [1,48] at t1, at T: [1 + 48(T-t1), 48 + 48(T-t1)]\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, the player is at some y, and for that freeway y, there is a car such that 0 is in Span(T) for that car.\n\nAnd the player is on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nAlso, when moving, at turn T, after action, y_{T+1} is set, but for collision at T, it's based on y_T, the row you are on during that turn.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in Span(T) but not Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, you are on y_T, and you check for cars on row y_T at time T.\n\nThen you take action a_T, which changes y to y_{T+1}, but for collision at T, it's only on the row you are on at T.\n\nSimilarly, at T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, and check cars on that row at time T+1.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which is y=9, and since y=0 to 9, y=9 is the top, no cars there, so once I reach y=9, I'm safe, no need to worry about cars above.\n\ny=9 is the target, and there are no freeways above, so no cars.\n\nNow, I start at y=3, turn t=14.\n\nI need to go to y=9, which is 6 units up, so minimum 6 turns if I go up every time, but I have to avoid cars on the way.\n\nI can go down or stay, but since I need to go up, down might not help, but perhaps to avoid cars, I might need to wait or go down temporarily.\n\nBut since time is minimized, probably I want to go up as much as possible, only deviate if necessary.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars on each freeway at t1=14.\n\nFreeway y=1: one car: (h=48, τ=1, d=right, s=48)\n\nSo at t1=14, span [τ, h] = [1,48]\n\nAt time T, span [1 + 48(T-14), 48 + 48(T-14)] = [1 + 48Δ, 48 + 48Δ] where Δ = T-14\n\nCollision if 0 in [1+48Δ, 48+48Δ]\n\nSince 1+48Δ >0 for Δ>=0, and 48+48Δ >>0, so for all T, 0 < 1+48Δ, so 0 not in span, so no collision on y=1 at any time? 1+48Δ >=1 for Δ>=0, so min is 1, so 0 < left end, so 0 not in interval, so no collision possible on y=1. Good, so freeway 1 is safe.\n\ny=1 has no car that covers x=0.\n\nNow freeway y=2: two cars: (-24,-35,right,12) and (48,37,right,12)\n\nFirst car: head h=-24, tail τ=-35? Direction right, but for right-moving, span is [τ, h]? Let's see.\n\nCars are given as (head h, tail τ, d, s)\n\nFor right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h]\n\nFirst car: h=-24, τ=-35, d=right, s=12\n\nSo τ=-35, h=-24, so span [ -35, -24] at t1=14\n\nAt time T, [ -35 + 12Δ, -24 + 12Δ] where Δ=T-14\n\nSecond car: h=48, τ=37, d=right, s=12, span at t1 [37,48], at T [37 +12Δ, 48+12Δ]\n\nNow, collision if 0 in either span for freeway y=2.\n\nFirst span: [ -35 +12Δ, -24 +12Δ]\n\n0 in this if -35 +12Δ <= 0 <= -24 +12Δ\n\nBut -35 +12Δ <= -24 +12Δ always, and since -35+12Δ <=0 when Δ <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916, and -24+12Δ >=0 when Δ >= 24/12=2.\n\nSo for Δ=2, -35+24= -11, -24+24=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 is included.\n\nAt Δ=2, T=16, span [ -35 +24, -24+24] = [-11,0], so 0 is the right end, so yes, 0 in span.\n\nSimilarly, at Δ=2. something, but since turns are integer, at T=16, Δ=2, 0 in [ -11,0].\n\nAt Δ=3, T=17, [ -35+36=1, -24+36=12], [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, lower Δ, smaller numbers, left of 0.\n\nNow second car: [37+12Δ,48+12Δ], min 37>0, so always positive, 0 not in.\n\nSo on y=2, collision at T=16 when Δ=2.\n\nSpecifically at T=16, if player on y=2, collision possible from first car.\n\nNow freeway y=3: same as y=2? Cars: (-24,-35,right,12) and (48,37,right,12), same as y=2.\n\nSo identical to y=2, so collision at T=16 on y=3 as well.\n\ny=3 has same cars.\n\nNow freeway y=4: one car: (-24,11,left,36)\n\nLeft-moving, so span at t1: [h, τ] = [-24,11] since h=-24, τ=11\n\nAt T, [ -24 -36Δ, 11 -36Δ]\n\nCollision if 0 in [ -24-36Δ, 11-36Δ]\n\nSo -24-36Δ <= 0 <= 11-36Δ\n\nLeft inequality: -24-36Δ <=0 => -36Δ <=24 => Δ >= -24/36 = -2/3, always true for Δ>=0\n\nRight inequality: 0 <= 11-36Δ => 36Δ <=11 => Δ <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305\n\nSince Δ integer >=0, Δ=0: T=14, span [-24,11], 0 in [-24,11]? -24<=0<=11, yes, 0 is between -24 and 11.\n\nAt T=14, Δ=0, span [-24,11], 0 is included.\n\nBut at T=14, we are at turn t1=14, but player is at (0,3), not on y=4, so no collision for player, but for the freeway.\n\nFor player, if at some T, player on y=4, and 0 in span at that T.\n\nAt T=14, Δ=0, 0 in span.\n\nBut T=14 is now, player on y=3.\n\nFor future T, Δ>=1, T=15, Δ=1, span [-24-36, 11-36] = [-60, -25], both negative, 0 not in.\n\nΔ=0 only at T=14.\n\nSo for y=4, only at T=14, 0 is covered, but for T>14, not covered, so no collision possible on y=4 for T>14.\n\nSimilarly, freeway y=5: same as y=4, car (-24,11,left,36), same thing, only covered at T=14, not later.\n\nNow freeway y=6: one car: (36,25,right,6)? Cars: (36,25,right,6)\n\nRight-moving, so head h=36, tail τ=25? Span at t1 [τ, h] = [25,36]\n\nAt T, [25 +6Δ, 36 +6Δ], always positive, min 25>0, so 0 never in, no collision on y=6.\n\nThe car is from 25 to 36, moving right, so x=0 not covered.\n\nNow freeway y=7: two cars: (-8,-19,right,4) and (56,45,right,4)\n\nFirst car: head h=-8, tail τ=-19, d=right, s=4\n\nSpan at t1 [τ, h] = [-19, -8]\n\nAt T, [-19 +4Δ, -8 +4Δ]\n\nCollision if 0 in this: -19+4Δ <=0 <= -8+4Δ\n\nLeft: -19+4Δ <=0 => 4Δ <=19 => Δ <= 19/4=4.75\n\nRight: 0 <= -8+4Δ => 4Δ >=8 => Δ >=2\n\nSo for Δ=2,3,4\n\nΔ=2: T=16, [-19+8, -8+8] = [-11,0], 0 included\n\nΔ=3: T=17, [-19+12, -8+12] = [-7,4], 0 in\n\nΔ=4: T=18, [-19+16, -8+16] = [-3,8], 0 in\n\nΔ=5: T=19, [-19+20, -8+20] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSecond car: h=56, τ=45, d=right, s=4, span [45,56] at t1, at T [45+4Δ,56+4Δ] >0, no 0.\n\nSo on y=7, collision when player on y=7 and T=16,17,18.\n\nNow freeway y=8: one car: (-6,-17,right,3)? Cars: (-6,-17,right,3)\n\nHead h=-6, tail τ=-17, d=right, s=3\n\nSpan [τ, h] = [-17, -6] at t1\n\nAt T, [-17 +3Δ, -6 +3Δ]\n\nCollision if 0 in [-17+3Δ, -6+3Δ]\n\n-17+3Δ <=0 <= -6+3Δ\n\nLeft: -17+3Δ <=0 => 3Δ <=17 => Δ <= 17/3≈5.666\n\nRight: 0 <= -6+3Δ => 3Δ >=6 => Δ >=2\n\nSo for Δ=2,3,4,5\n\nΔ=2: T=16, [-17+6, -6+6] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nΔ=3: T=17, [-17+9, -6+9] = [-8,3], 0 in\n\nΔ=4: T=18, [-17+12, -6+12] = [-5,6], 0 in\n\nΔ=5: T=19, [-17+15, -6+15] = [-2,9], 0 in\n\nΔ=6: T=20, [-17+18, -6+18] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo collision on y=8 for T=16 to 19.\n\nNow, summarize dangerous times for each row:\n\ny=1: always safe, no car covers x=0.\n\ny=2: dangerous at T=16 (from car)\n\ny=3: dangerous at T=16 (same as y=2)\n\ny=4: only dangerous at T=14, but since T>14, safe for T>=15\n\ny=5: same, safe after T=14\n\ny=6: always safe\n\ny=7: dangerous at T=16,17,18\n\ny=8: dangerous at T=16,17,18,19\n\nNow, player starts at t=14, y=3.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so once reached, safe.\n\nActions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), S (stay, y same)\n\ny must be between 0 and 9.\n\nStart y=3 at t=14.\n\nWe need to go to y=9, so net +6 in y.\n\nEach U increases y by 1, so minimum 6 turns if always up.\n\nBut we have to avoid being on dangerous rows at dangerous times.\n\nFirst, let's see if we can go directly up.\n\nSuppose we go U at each turn.\n\nThen:\n\nt=14: y=3 (start)\n\nAction at t=14: a_{14}, then y_{15} = y_{14} + Δy\n\nPlayer position at turn T is y_T.\n\nAt turn T=14, position is (0,3), which is given.\n\nThen we choose action a_{14}, which determines y_{15} = y_{14} + Δy_{14}\n\nSimilarly, at T=15, we choose a_{15}, y_{16} = y_{15} + Δy_{15}, and so on.\n\nFor collision at turn T, it depends on y_T and the cars on row y_T at time T.\n\nIn this case, at T=14, y=3, and we need to check if collision at T=14 on y=3.\n\ny=3 at T=14: from above, y=3 is dangerous at T=16, but at T=14, what about y=3?\n\nFor y=3, cars: at t1=14, span for first car: [-35,-24] for the one on y=3? Earlier for y=3, cars (-24,-35,right,12) and (48,37,right,12)\n\nAt T=14, Δ=0, first car span [-35,-24], 0 not in, since -24<0? -35 to -24, all negative, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car [37,48], positive, 0 not in.\n\nSo at T=14, on y=3, no collision, safe.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows at T=14.\n\nBut for y=4 and y=5, at T=14, 0 is covered, but player not on them.\n\nNow, back to going up.\n\nIf we always go U:\n\nt=14: y=3, no collision (as above)\n\nChoose a_{14} = U, so y_{15} = 3 +1 =4\n\nt=15: now at y=4\n\nCheck collision on y=4 at t=15.\n\ny=4 at T=15: from above, for y=4, car only dangerous at T=14, at T=15, Δ=1, span [-24-36,11-36]=[-60,-25], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nChoose a_{15} = U, y_{16} =4+1=5\n\nt=16: at y=5\n\ny=5 at T=16: similar to y=4, at T=16, Δ=2, span for y=5 car: [-24 -36*2, 11-36*2]? For y=5, same car as y=4, (-24,11,left,36)\n\nAt T=16, Δ=2, [ -24 -72, 11-72] = [-96,-61], 0 not in, safe.\n\nBut we are at y=5, which is safe.\n\nNow, action a_{16}, say U, y_{17}=5+1=6\n\nt=17: at y=6\n\ny=6: always safe, as we saw.\n\na_{17}=U, y_{18}=7\n\nt=18: at y=7\n\ny=7 at T=18: dangerous, from above, y=7 dangerous at T=16,17,18.\n\nAt T=18, Δ=4, for first car on y=7: [-19+4*4, -8+4*4] = [-19+16, -8+16] = [-3,8], 0 in, so collision if on y=7 at T=18.\n\nProblem.\n\nSo at t=18, y=7, collision.\n\nIf we go U at t=17 to y=7 at t=18.\n\nBut t=18 is T=18.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=17, we are at y=6, choose a_{17}, if U, then y_{18}=7, and at turn t=18, position y=7, which is dangerous.\n\nSo collision.\n\nWe could choose to stay or go down, but we need to go up.\n\nPerhaps delay or something.\n\nSince y=7 is dangerous at t=18, we need to not be on y=7 at t=18.\n\nSimilarly, in the direct up path, at t=16, we were at y=5, which is safe, but then to y=6 at t=17, safe, then to y=7 at t=18, collision.\n\nSo we need to avoid being on y=7 at t=18.\n\nBut t=18 is fixed time.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 asap.\n\nPerhaps go up slower or faster.\n\nStart at t=14, y=3.\n\nt=14: y=3, safe.\n\nWe can choose to go U to y=4 at t=15, or S stay y=3, or D down to y=2, but y=2 might be dangerous later.\n\nSince y=7 is bad at t=18, we might want to be at a different row at t=18.\n\nt=18 is turn 18.\n\nFrom start, t=14 to t=18 is 4 turns later? Turns: t=14,15,16,17,18: that's 5 turns including t=14? No.\n\nTurn indices: at turn T, position y_T.\n\nT=14: y=3\n\nAfter action a_T, y_{T+1} set.\n\nSo from T=14 to T=18, that's 4 steps: actions at T=14,15,16,17 to reach position at T=18.\n\ny_{18} depends on actions from T=14 to T=17.\n\nSimilarly, position at T is before action.\n\nTo not be on y=7 at T=18.\n\nIn the direct path, at T=18, we would be at y=7 if we went up from y=5 at T=16 to y=6 at T=17 to y=7 at T=18.\n\nWe need to be at y=7 at a different time, or avoid it.\n\ny=7 is dangerous at T=16,17,18, so only safe at other times.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 dangerous at T=16-19.\n\nNow, let's list safe times for each row:\n\ny=1: always safe\n\ny=2: safe except T=16\n\ny=3: safe except T=16\n\ny=4: safe for all T>=15 (since dangerous only at T=14)\n\ny=5: safe for all T>=15\n\ny=6: always safe\n\ny=7: dangerous T=16,17,18; safe otherwise, e.g., T=15,19,etc.\n\nAt T=15, y=7: Δ=T-14=1, for y=7 first car: [-19+4(1), -8+4(1)] = [-15,-4], both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car no, so safe at T=15.\n\nAt T=19, Δ=5, [-19+20, -8+20]=[1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, T=20, etc.\n\nSo y=7 safe for T<=15 or T>=19.\n\ny=8: dangerous T=16,17,18,19; safe for T<=15 or T>=20? T=15: Δ=1, [-17+3, -6+3] = [-14,-3], 0 not in, safe.\n\nT=20: Δ=6, [-17+18, -6+18]=[1,12], safe.\n\nSo safe for T<=15 or T>=20.\n\nNow, we need to go from y=3 at T=14 to y=9.\n\nMinimum steps: 6 up actions.\n\nBut we might need to take more turns if we wait.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 have restrictions around t=16-19.\n\nt=14 now.\n\nPerhaps we can go up to y=6 and wait, since y=6 always safe.\n\nThen go up when safe.\n\ny=6 to y=7 to y=8 to y=9.\n\nBut y=7 and y=8 need safe times.\n\nTarget y=9, no issue.\n\nStart at T=14, y=3.\n\nWe can go up directly to y=4 at T=15, y=5 at T=16, but at T=16, y=5 is safe, but if we go to y=6 at T=17, safe, but then to y=7 at T=18 dangerous.\n\nIf we stay at y=5 for one turn or something.\n\nLet's list possible paths.\n\nFirst, we need to cover the y-increase: from 3 to 9, delta 6, so at least 6 moves with +1, but we can have S or D, which would add turns.\n\nH is the number of turns from t1, so actions from t1 to t1+H-1, and position at t1+H-1 is y=9.\n\nAfter H actions, we reach y=9 at turn t1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\nStart at turn t1, position (0, y_{t1})\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, position at turn t1+1 is y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}\n\nSimilarly, after a_{t1+1}, y_{t1+2}, ..., up to after a_{t1+H-1}, y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Δy_{t1+H-1}\n\nWe want y_{t1+H} =9? No.\n\nThe position at turn t1 + H -1 should be (0,9)? Let's read.\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\n\"determine minimal number of turns H and sequence {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1, meaning a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, and after these H actions, we are at turn t1+H, but the position at turn t1+H is after the last action.\n\nBut we want to reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nI think I misread.\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}\n\nAt turn t1 + t, for t=0, it is turn t1, position y_{t1} is given before any action.\n\nThen we choose a_{t1}, which affects y_{t1+1}\n\nThen at turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1}, we choose a_{t1+1}, and so on, up to a_{t1+H-1}, which determines y_{t1+H}\n\nWe want position at turn t1 + H -1 to be (0,9)\n\nTurn t1 + H -1 is after H-1 actions? Let's index.\n\nSet T = t1 + k for k=0,1,2,...\n\nAt T = t1 + 0 = t1, position y_T given.\n\nAfter action a_T, y_{T+1} is set.\n\nWe want for some T, y_T =9.\n\nSpecifically, at turn t1 + H -1, y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nNow, turn t1 + H -1 is reached after (H-1) actions from t1.\n\nFrom turn t1 to turn t1 + H -1, there are (H-1) actions: a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-2} affect the position from y_{t1+1} to y_{t1+H-1}\n\nAt turn t1, position y_{t1} without action.\n\nAfter a_{t1}, y_{t1+1} at turn t1+1.\n\nAfter a_{t1+1}, y_{t1+2} at turn t1+2.\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{t1+k}, y_{t1+k+1} at turn t1+k+1.\n\nWe want at turn t1 + H -1, y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nThis position is set by the action a_{t1+H-2} from previous position.\n\ny_{t1+H-1} = y_{t1+H-2} + Δy_{t1+H-2}\n\nAnd it must be 9.\n\nThe actions are from t=0 to H-1, so a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, but a_{t1+H-1} is chosen at turn t1+H-1, which affects y_{t1+H}, not y_{t1+H-1}.\n\nI think there's confusion.\n\nLet's read the problem.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\" with action a_t chosen at turn t.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t, choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo the sequence of actions is for turns t from t1 to t1+H-1, so a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1}\n\nAfter a_{t1+H-1}, we have y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Δy_{t1+H-1}\n\nBut we want to reach at turn t1 + H -1, which is before the last action.\n\nAt turn t1 + H -1, position is y_{t1+H-1}, and we want this to be (0,9).\n\nThen at that turn, we choose a_{t1+H-1}, which might move us away, but since we reached (0,9) at that turn, it's done, the action doesn't matter for reaching, but we have to specify the action sequence up to H-1 actions? H actions from t=0 to H-1.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, that's H actions.\n\nBut after H actions, we are at turn t1+H.\n\nWe want position at turn t1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nSo for example, with H=1, we want at turn t1 +1 -1 = t1, y_{t1}=9, but here y_{t1}=3, not 9, so H>1.\n\nWith H actions, we have positions from y_{t1} to y_{t1+H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo for instance, if H=6, we want y_{t1+5} =9.\n\nAnd actions a_{t1} to a_{t1+5} for H=6 actions.\n\na_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, so for H=6, actions at t1 to t1+5, which determine y_{t1+1} to y_{t1+6}, and we want y_{t1+5} =9.\n\nSo y at turn t1+5 is 9, and it is set by action a_{t1+4} from y_{t1+4}, but y_{t1+5} is at turn t1+5.\n\nTurn t1+5 is when position is y_{t1+5}, and we choose a_{t1+5} there, but for reaching, we care about the position at that turn.\n\nIn terms of collision, at each turn T, when we are at y_T, we check for collision.\n\nFor the position at turn t1+H-1 to be 9 and safe.\n\nBack to the problem.\n\nStart at T=14, y=3.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at some turn, say T_reach, with T_reach = t1 + H -1 = 14 + H -1.\n\nMinimal H means minimal T_reach? H is number of turns from start, so smaller H means earlier reach.\n\nH is the number of actions in the sequence, from t=0 to H-1, so H actions.\n\nThen T_reach = t1 + H -1.\n\nSince t1=14, T_reach = 13 + H.\n\nT_reach = 14 + H -1 = 13 + H.\n\nFor example, if H=6, T_reach=19; if H=7, T_reach=20, etc.\n\nBut we want minimal H, so small T_reach.\n\nBut we have constraints.\n\nNow, from start, we can go up.\n\nBut earlier, if we go up continuously, we can reach y=9 at T=20? Let's see.\n\nFrom y=3 at T=14.\n\nIf all U:\n\nT=14: y=3, safe\n\na=U, y=4 at T=15\n\nT=15: y=4, safe (as earlier)\n\na=U, y=5 at T=16\n\nT=16: y=5, safe\n\na=U, y=6 at T=17\n\nT=17: y=6, safe\n\na=U, y=7 at T=18\n\nT=18: y=7, but y=7 dangerous at T=18, collision\n\nNot good.\n\nIf at T=17, we don't go U, but S or D.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\nSince y=7 is bad at T=18, we can be at y=7 at T=19, which is safe for y=7.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at T=20 safe.\n\nSo let's aim to be at y=7 at T=19.\n\nFrom start, T=14, y=3.\n\nTo be at y=7 at T=19, that's 5 turns later, delta y=4, so we need to increase by 4 in 5 turns, so one S or D, but D down is bad, so S.\n\nSimilarly, to y=9 from there.\n\nFirst, get to y=7 at T=19.\n\nT=19, y=7 is safe.\n\nThen from there to y=9.\n\nBut let's see the path to y=7 at T=19.\n\nFrom T=14, y=3 to T=19, y=7, that's 5 turns: T=14 to T=19, positions y at T=14,15,16,17,18,19.\n\nAt T=19, we want y=7.\n\nSo from T=14 to T=18, we need to reach a position such that after actions, y_19=7.\n\ny_19 depends on y_18 and action a_18.\n\nBut we want y_19=7.\n\nSimilarly, y_18 depends on y_17 and a_17, etc.\n\nSince we want to minimize H, and T_reach=13+H for y=9.\n\nFirst, let's find a way to avoid the collision.\n\nOption: stay at lower rows longer.\n\nFor example, at T=16, if we are not on y=2 or y=3, but we can be on y=4 or y=5 or y=6.\n\ny=2 and y=3 dangerous only at T=16, other times safe.\n\ny=4,5,6 safe always except y=4 at T=14 which is past.\n\nSo at T=16, we can be on y=1,4,5,6 safe.\n\ny=1 safe, y=4 safe, y=5 safe, y=6 safe.\n\ny=7 dangerous at T=16.\n\nSimilarly, T=17: y=7 dangerous, y=8 dangerous? y=8 dangerous T=16-19, so at T=17, y=8 dangerous.\n\ny=7 dangerous T=16,17,18.\n\nT=18: y=7 and y=8 dangerous.\n\nT=19: y=8 dangerous, y=7 safe.\n\netc.\n\nSo for T=16: safe rows: y=1,4,5,6\n\nT=17: y=7 dangerous, y=8 dangerous, so safe: y=1,2,3,4,5,6 (y=2 and y=3 safe at T=17, since only dangerous at T=16)\n\ny=2 dangerous only T=16, so at T=17 safe.\n\nSimilarly y=3 safe at T=17.\n\ny=4,5,6 safe.\n\ny=7 dangerous, y=8 dangerous.\n\nSo safe at T=17: y=1,2,3,4,5,6\n\nT=18: y=7 dangerous, y=8 dangerous, so safe: y=1,2,3,4,5,6\n\nT=19: y=7 safe (since dangerous only up to T=18), y=8 dangerous (T=19 dangerous), so safe: y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7 (y=7 safe at T=19)\n\ny=7 safe at T=19.\n\ny=8 dangerous at T=19.\n\nT=20: y=7 safe, y=8 safe (dangerous only up to T=19), so y=8 safe at T=20.\n\netc.\n\nNow back to path.\n\nStart T=14, y=3, safe.\n\nWe can go U to y=4 at T=15.\n\nT=15: y=4, safe.\n\nNow at T=15, we need to choose action for y at T=16.\n\nT=16 is dangerous for y=2 and y=3, but we are at y=4.\n\nIf we go U to y=5 at T=16.\n\nT=16: y=5, safe, since y=5 always safe except T=14.\n\nThen at T=16, we can choose to go U to y=6 at T=17.\n\nT=17: y=6, safe.\n\nThen at T=17, if we go U to y=7 at T=18.\n\nBut T=18, y=7 dangerous, collision.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nAt T=17, we can stay S, y=6 at T=18.\n\nT=18: y=6, safe.\n\nThen at T=18, we can go U to y=7 at T=19.\n\nT=19: y=7, safe (since T=19, y=7 safe).\n\nThen at T=19, go U to y=8 at T=20.\n\nT=20: y=8, but y=8 dangerous at T=20? Earlier, y=8 safe at T=20.\n\ny=8 dangerous T=16-19, so at T=20, Δ=6, [1,12], safe.\n\nYes.\n\nThen at T=20, go U to y=9 at T=21.\n\nT=21: y=9, reached.\n\nBut we reached at T=21.\n\nT_reach =21.\n\nNow H: T_reach = t1 + H -1 =14 + H -1\n\n21 = 13 + H, so H=8.\n\nBut is this minimal? We have extra steps.\n\nFrom T=19 y=7, to T=20 y=8, to T=21 y=9.\n\nBut we can go directly.\n\nAt T=19 y=7, we can go U to y=8 at T=20, then U to y=9 at T=21.\n\nBut y=8 at T=20 is safe.\n\nTo reach y=9 faster.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=6 and stay, then go up later.\n\nBut y=6 is safe.\n\nStart: T=14 y=3, U to y=4 at T=15\n\nT=15 y=4, U to y=5 at T=16\n\nT=16 y=5, safe\n\nNow, instead of U, we can stay S at T=16, so y=5 at T=17? Action at T=16: if S, then y_{17} = y_{16} =5\n\nT=17: y=5, safe\n\nThen at T=17, we can go U to y=6 at T=18\n\nT=18: y=6, safe\n\nThen at T=18, U to y=7 at T=19\n\nT=19: y=7, safe\n\nThen U to y=8 at T=20\n\nT=20: y=8, safe\n\nU to y=9 at T=21\n\nSame as before, T=21.\n\nFrom T=16 y=5, we can go D down? But that might not help.\n\nGo U to y=6 at T=17, then at T=17, instead of U, stay S, y=6 at T=18, same as above.\n\nThen to y=7 at T=19.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=7 is safe at T=19, and y=8 safe at T=20, y=9 at T=21.\n\nBut can we reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=7 at T=19, but T=19 is later.\n\nWhat if we go faster to higher rows.\n\nAt T=14 y=3, we can go U to y=4 at T=15\n\nThen at T=15 y=4, instead of U, we can go U again to y=5 at T=16? T=15 action: if U, y=5 at T=16.\n\nBut at T=16, y=5 is safe.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAt T=15, we can go S, stay at y=4 for T=16.\n\nT=15: y=4, action S, then y_{16} =4\n\nT=16: y=4, safe.\n\nThen at T=16, go U to y=5 at T=17\n\nT=17: y=5, safe\n\nThen U to y=6 at T=18\n\nT=18: y=6, safe\n\nThen U to y=7 at T=19\n\nSame as before.\n\nNo gain.\n\nStart by staying or going down, but that would delay more.\n\nFor example, at T=14, go S, y=3 at T=15.\n\nT=15: y=3, now T=15, is y=3 safe? Earlier, y=3 dangerous only at T=16, so at T=15, safe.\n\nThen go U to y=4 at T=16.\n\nT=16: y=4, safe.\n\nThen go U to y=5 at T=17\n\nT=17: y=5, safe\n\nU to y=6 at T=18\n\nU to y=7 at T=19\n\nThen to y=8 at T=20, y=9 at T=21, same.\n\nBut at T=19 y=7, we can go U to y=8 at T=20, but y=8 at T=20 safe, then U to y=9 at T=21.\n\nTo reach y=9 at T=20, for example.\n\nThat would be better.\n\nT_reach=20.\n\nThen H: T_reach =14 + H -1 =13 + H =20, so H=7.\n\nIs it possible?\n\nReach y=9 at T=20.\n\nThen position at T=20 is 9.\n\ny_{20} =9.\n\nNow, from start, with actions from T=14 to T=19, 6 actions? H actions from a_{14} to a_{14+H-1}\n\ny at T=14+H-1 =9.\n\nSet T=14+H-1=20, so 14+H-1=20, H-1=6, H=7.\n\nYes, 7 actions.\n\nNow, y_{20} =9.\n\nThis must be set by action at T=19: from y_{19}, a_{19}=U, so y_{20}=y_{19}+1=9, so y_{19}=8.\n\nSimilarly, at T=19, position y_{19}=8.\n\nNow, at T=19, y=8, but y=8 is dangerous at T=19.\n\ny=8 dangerous at T=16,17,18,19.\n\nAt T=19, Δ=5, for y=8 car: [-17+3*5, -6+3*5] = [-17+15, -6+15] = [-2,9], and 0 in [-2,9], yes, collision.\n\nSo at T=19, if on y=8, collision.\n\nTherefore, cannot be on y=8 at T=19.\n\nBut to have y_{20}=9, we need y_{19}=8 and a_{19}=U.\n\nBut y_{19}=8 at T=19 is not safe.\n\nIf we reach y=9 at T=19, but T=19, y=9 is safe, but how?\n\ny_{19}=9, which requires y_{18}=8 and a_{18}=U, or y_{18}=9 and a_{18}=S, but S keeps same, so if y_{18}=9, a_{18}=S, y_{19}=9.\n\nBut we need to reach earlier.\n\nFirst, can we reach y=9 at T=19?\n\nT=19, y=9.\n\nThen y_{19}=9.\n\nThis is set by action at T=18: if a_{18}=U, then y_{19}=y_{18}+1=9, so y_{18}=8.\n\nIf a_{18}=S, y_{19}=y_{18}=9, so y_{18}=9.\n\nBut y_{18}=9 at T=18 is fine, no cars.\n\nBut let's see if possible.\n\nFirst, from start to y=9 at T=19.\n\nThat requires net +6 in y from T=14 to T=19.\n\nT=14 to T=19 is 5 turns of position: T=14,15,16,17,18,19.\n\ny at T=14:3, T:19:9, so increase of 6 in 5 steps? The positions: at T=14, y=3; after actions, y at T=15,16,17,18,19.\n\nFrom y_{14} to y_{19}, that's 5 changes, but y_{19} = y_{14} + sum_{t=14 to 18} Δy_t\n\nSince y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, so y_{19} = y_{14} + Δy_{14} + Δy_{15} + Δy_{16} + Δy_{17} + Δy_{18}\n\nFrom t=14 to t=18, 5 actions? Indices.\n\ny_{19} = y_{14} + Δy_{14} + Δy_{15} + ... + Δy_{18}\n\nThat's 5 terms of Δy.\n\nEach Δy is -1,0,1.\n\ny_{19} = 9, y_{14}=3, so 9 = 3 + sum_{k=14 to 18} Δy_k\n\nThus sum_{k=14 to 18} Δy_k = 6\n\nSince each |Δy|<=1, we need all Δy_k =1 for k=14 to 18, so 5 up actions, but 5 actions give +5, 3+5=8, not 9.\n\ny_{19} = y_{14} + sum_{t=14 to 18} Δy_t = 3 + sum of 5 Δy_t =9, so sum=6, impossible since max per step +1, 5*1=5, 3+5=8<9.\n\nSo cannot reach y=9 at T=19 from y=3 at T=14 with 5 actions; minimum 6 actions needed to increase by 6.\n\ny_{14} =3, after first action a_{14}, y_{15} = y_{14} + Δy_{14}, up to after a_{18}, y_{19} = y_{18} + Δy_{18}\n\nTo have y_{19}=9, and y_{14}=3, the number of actions from t=14 to t=18 is 5 actions, each can add at most +1, so y_{19} <= 3+5=8.\n\nSimilarly, to have 9, we need at least 6 actions: for example, actions at t=14,15,16,17,18,19 to reach y_{20}=9.\n\nThen T_reach = t1 + H -1 =14 + H -1\n\nSet y_{14+H-1} =9.\n\nFor H=6, T_reach=14+6-1=19, y_{19}=9, but as above, y_{19} <= 3+5=8 if only 5 actions before, contradiction.\n\nWith H actions, we have actions a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, which affect positions up to y_{t1+H}.\n\ny_{t1+H} = y_{t1} + sum_{k=t1}^{t1+H-1} Δy_k\n\nBut we want y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\ny_{t1+H-1} is the position at turn t1+H-1.\n\ny_{t1+H-1} = y_{t1} + sum_{k=t1}^{t1+H-2} Δy_k\n\nFor example, t1=14, y_{14+H-1} = y_{14} + sum_{k=14}^{14+H-2} Δy_k = 3 + sum of (H-1) terms of Δy.\n\nEach Δy <=1, so to have 9, 3 + sum =9, sum=6, so H-1 >=6, H>=7.\n\nSimilarly, min H=7.\n\nThen T_reach =14 +7 -1=20.\n\ny_{20} =9.\n\nWith H=7 actions: a_{14} to a_{20}? a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1} = a_{14} to a_{14+6} = a_{20} for H=7? t1+H-1=14+7-1=20, so actions a_{14} to a_{20}, that's 7 actions.\n\nThen y at turn t: after a_{t}, y_{t+1}.\n\nPosition at turn t is y_t before action.\n\nAt turn t1+H-1=20, y_{20}=9.\n\ny_{20} is set by action at t=19: a_{19} from y_{19}.\n\nIf a_{19}=U, y_{20}=y_{19}+1=9, so y_{19}=8.\n\nIf a_{19}=S, y_{20}=y_{19}=9, so y_{19}=9.\n\nSimilarly, y_{19} must be 8 or 9.\n\nBut y_{19} at turn 19.\n\nNow, with H=7, we need to go from y_{14}=3 to y_{20}=9, so increase by 6 in 6 steps? From y_{14} to y_{20}, that's 6 changes: y_{15} to y_{20} are set by actions from t=14 to 19.\n\ny_{20} = y_{14} + sum_{k=14}^{19} Δy_k = 3 + sum of 6 Δy_k =9, so sum_{k=14}^{19} Δy_k =6.\n\nSince each |Δy|<=1, we must have all Δy_k=1 for k=14 to 19, so 6 up actions.\n\nThus, we must go up every turn from t=14 to t=19.\n\nThen positions:\n\nT=14: y=3\n\na_{14}=U, y_{15}=4\n\nT=15: y=4\n\na_{15}=U, y_{16}=5\n\nT=16: y=5\n\na_{16}=U, y_{17}=6\n\nT=17: y=6\n\na_{17}=U, y_{18}=7\n\nT=18: y=7\n\na_{18}=U, y_{19}=8\n\nT=19: y=8\n\na_{19}=U, y_{20}=9\n\nT=20: y=9, reached.\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nT=14: y=3, safe as before\n\nT=15: y=4, safe\n\nT=16: y=5, safe\n\nT=17: y=6, safe\n\nT=18: y=7, but y=7 dangerous at T=18, collision! Because at T=18, on y=7, and 0 in car span.\n\nSpecifically, for y=7 at T=18, Δ=4, car span [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nSo collision at T=18.\n\nTherefore, this path has collision.\n\nWe cannot go directly up because of T=18 y=7.\n\nTo avoid, we need to not be on y=7 at T=18.\n\nIn this sequence, at T=18 we are at y=7, which is bad.\n\nSo we need to be at different y at T=18.\n\nFor example, at T=18, safe rows are y=1,2,3,4,5,6 since y=7 and 8 dangerous.\n\ny=6 is safe.\n\nIn the path above, at T=17 we are at y=6, and we go U to y=7 at T=18, but instead, we could go S or D.\n\nBut if we go S at T=17, then y_{18}=y_{17}=6, so at T=18, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at T=18, we go U to y=7 at T=19.\n\nT=19: y=7, safe (since T=19, y=7 safe)\n\nThen at T=19, go U to y=8 at T=20.\n\nBut T=20: y=8, safe? Yes, T=20, y=8 safe.\n\nThen we need y_{20}=8, but we want y_{20}=9, so at T=19, y=7, go U to y=8 at T=20.\n\nThen at T=20, position y=8, not 9.\n\nThen we need another action to go to y=9 at T=21.\n\nBut we want to reach at T=20, but y_{20}=8, not 9.\n\nWith H=7, we want y_{20}=9.\n\nIf at T=19, we are at y=8, and go U to y=9 at T=20, but at T=19, y=8 is dangerous.\n\nConflict.\n\nLet's list the positions we need for H=7.\n\ny_{20} =9.\n\nThis requires that at T=19, y_{19} and a_{19} such that y_{20}=y_{19} + Δy_{19} =9.\n\nSo if a_{19}=U, y_{19}=8; if a_{19}=S, y_{19}=9; if a_{19}=D, y_{19}=10, impossible, so y_{19}=8 or 9.\n\nBut y_{19} at T=19 must be safe.\n\nNow, y=8 at T=19 is dangerous, collision.\n\ny=9 at T=19 is safe, no cars.\n\nSo possible to have y_{19}=9.\n\nThen a_{19}=S, so y_{20}=9.\n\nOr a_{19}=U, but if y_{19}=9, U to y=10 invalid, so only S or D, but D to 8, not good.\n\nSo if y_{19}=9, a_{19}=S, y_{20}=9.\n\nThen we reach at T=19 and T=20, but we need only at T=20 for H=7? T_reach=t1+H-1=20.\n\ny_{20}=9.\n\nBut if y_{19}=9, and a_{19}=S, y_{20}=9, good.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9 at turn 20, which is satisfied.\n\nBut in this case, we reached at T=19 already, but the position at T=20 is also 9.\n\nBut for the sequence, it's fine.\n\nBut can we have y_{19}=9?\n\ny_{19}=9 requires that from start, we reach y=9 by T=19.\n\ny_{19} = y_{14} + sum_{k=14}^{18} Δy_k = 3 + sum of 5 Δy_k =9, so sum=6, impossible with 5 actions, max +5, y=8.\n\nSo y_{19} <= 3+5=8, cannot be 9.\n\nTherefore, for H=7, y_{20} = y_{14} + sum_{k=14}^{19} Δy_k =3 + sum of 6 Δy_k =9, so sum=6, all Δy_k=1.\n\nThus y_{19} = y_{14} + sum_{k=14}^{18} Δy_k =3 +5=8, since all U up to t=18.\n\nThen y_{19}=8 at T=19, which is dangerous for y=8, collision.\n\nIf we have some S or D, y_{19} <8, then y_{20} <9, not 9.\n\nSo for H=7, with all U, we have collision at T=18 or T=19.\n\nSpecifically, at T=18 y=7 collision if we go U at T=17, but even if we modify, at T=19 y=8 collision.\n\nSo impossible to reach y=9 at T=20 without collision for H=7.\n\nTherefore, minimal H must be larger.\n\nNow H=8, T_reach=14+8-1=21.\n\ny_{21}=9.\n\nThen y_{21} = y_{14} + sum_{k=14}^{20} Δy_k =3 + sum of 7 Δy_k =9, so sum=6, so we need 6 up actions and one stay or down, but since down not helpful, probably one stay.\n\nNow, we can avoid the dangerous times.\n\nFor example, as in the first plan: go to y=6 and wait until safe to go up.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nT=14: y=3, safe, a=U, y=4 at T=15\n\nT=15: y=4, safe, a=U, y=5 at T=16\n\nT=16: y=5, safe, a=U, y=6 at T=17\n\nT=17: y=6, safe, now instead of U, a=S, so y=6 at T=18\n\nT=18: y=6, safe, a=U, y=7 at T=19\n\nT=19: y=7, safe (T=19), a=U, y=8 at T=20\n\nT=20: y=8, safe (T=20), a=U, y=9 at T=21\n\nT=21: y=9, reached.\n\nNow, with H=8 actions: a_{14} to a_{20}, 7 actions? H=8, actions from t=0 to H-1, so a_{14} to a_{14+7}=a_{21}? t1=14, actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}, so for H=8, t=0 to 7, actions a_{14} to a_{21}.\n\nThen position at turn t1+H-1=14+8-1=21, y_{21}=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, with a_{14}=U, a_{15}=U, a_{16}=U, a_{17}=S, a_{18}=U, a_{19}=U, a_{20}=U, then y_{21}=9.\n\nActions: a_{14} to a_{20}, that's 7 actions, but H=8, so need a_{21} as well.\n\nAfter a_{20}, y_{21} is set, but at turn T=21, we are at y_{21}, and we need to choose a_{21}, but since we reached at T=21, a_{21} can be anything, but we have to specify the action sequence up to H-1, which is a_{21} for H=8.\n\nThe sequence should include a_{21}, but it doesn't affect reaching, we can set S or U, but since y=9, U invalid, so S.\n\nIn the action sequence, for reaching, at T=21, we are at y=9, and we choose a_{21}, which could be S.\n\nIn the path above, with actions from a_{14} to a_{20}, we have y_{21}=9, but the position at T=21 is y_{21}=9, reached.\n\nBut the actions are a_{14} to a_{20}, 7 actions, but for H=8, we need 8 actions, including a_{21}.\n\nPerhaps we add a_{21}=S.\n\nSince we reach at turn T=21 with y=9, and action at T=21 is chosen but not necessary for reaching.\n\nBut the sequence must have H actions.\n\nTo minimize H, with H=8, it works.\n\nBut can we do with H=7? We saw it's impossible due to the time constraints.\n\nAnother way: perhaps go down to avoid, but that might take more turns.\n\nFor example, at some point go to y=1 or something, but y=1 safe, but it might delay reaching y=9.\n\nSince we have to go up, probably not helpful.\n\nSo minimal H=8.\n\nIn the sequence, with the stay at y=6.\n\nIn the above, we stayed at T=17 with S, so at T=18 y=6.\n\nBut we could stay later.\n\nBut let's confirm the sequence.\n\nCurrent turn t1=14, position (0,3)\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 14: a_{14} = U  // to y=4 at T=15\n\nTurn 15: a_{15} = U  // to y=5 at T=16\n\nTurn 16: a_{16} = U  // to y=6 at T=17\n\nTurn 17: a_{17} = S  // stay, so y=6 at T=18\n\nTurn 18: a_{18} = U  // to y=7 at T=19\n\nTurn 19: a_{19} = U  // to y=8 at T=20\n\nTurn 20: a_{20} = U  // to y=9 at T=21\n\nNow, at T=21, y=9, reached.\n\nBut we need 8 actions, so we have a_{14} to a_{20}, that's 7 actions, missing one.\n\nH=8, so actions from t=0 to 7: a_{14}, a_{15}, a_{16}, a_{17}, a_{18}, a_{19}, a_{20}, a_{21}\n\nIn the sequence above, up to a_{20}, we reach y_{21}=9 at T=21.\n\nThen at T=21, we need to choose a_{21}, which can be S, since y=9.\n\nSo add a_{21} = S\n\nThen the sequence has 8 actions.\n\nPosition at turn 21 is y=9.\n\nIn the action sequence, a_{21} is chosen at turn 21, but since we already reached, it doesn't matter.\n\nBut for the sequence, it must be included.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut is there a way with H=7? We think not, but let's confirm.\n\nSuppose we go up but skip the dangerous row at dangerous time.\n\nFor example, at T=17, instead of going to y=7 at T=18, we go directly to y=8 or something, but not possible.\n\nFrom T=16, y=5, we go U to y=6 at T=17.\n\nThen at T=17, if we go U to y=7 at T=18, collision.\n\nIf we go D to y=5 at T=18, then we are lower.\n\nThen at T=18, y=5, safe, then go U to y=6 at T=19, etc., but it takes more turns.\n\nFor example, T=16: y=5, a=D, y=6? y=5, D, y_{17}=4? y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, Δy for D is -1.\n\nSo at T=16, y=5, a=D, then y_{17}=4\n\nT=17: y=4, then a=U, y_{18}=5\n\nT=18: y=5, a=U, y_{19}=6\n\nAnd so on, worse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nThus, minimal H=8.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we have one S action.\n\nWe could have the stay earlier, but not necessary.\n\nIn the sequence above, we stayed at T=17.\n\nBut at T=17, we are at y=6, which is safe, and we stay so that at T=18 we are at y=6, not y=7.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nNow, to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the sequence, for turn t1=14, actions starting from a_{14}.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 14: a_{14} Turn 15: a_{15} ... Turn 21: a_{21} }\n\nWith H=8, turns from 14 to 21 for actions.\n\nActions: as above.\n\nBut let's list:\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: S  // stay at y=6\n\nTurn 18: U  // to y=7\n\nTurn 19: U  // to y=8\n\nTurn 20: U  // to y=9\n\nTurn 21: S  // at y=9, stay\n\nIn the position, at turn 20, after a_{20}=U, y_{21}=9, so at turn 21, y=9.\n\nAnd a_{21}=S, but since y=9, S is fine, or could be omitted, but we need to specify.\n\nIn the sequence, we must have actions up to a_{21}.\n\nSince we reached at turn 21, and action at 21 doesn't change position, it's ok.\n\nPerhaps we can reach at turn 20 with H=8? T_reach=14+H-1=21 for H=8.\n\nWith H=8, T_reach=21.\n\nTo reach earlier, need smaller H, but not possible.\n\nAnother idea: since y=9 has no cars, we can reach it directly if possible.\n\nBut from y=3, need to go through the freeways.\n\nPerhaps go to y=9 via other paths, but must go through y=7 or y=8.\n\ny=8 to y=9.\n\nBut with the constraints, I think H=8 is minimal.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: S\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: S\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 17: S, so we stay at y=6 for that turn.\n\nThen turn 18: U to y=7.\n\nIn terms of turns: at turn 17, position y=6, choose S, so y_{18}=6.\n\nThen turn 18, position y=6, choose U, y_{19}=7.\n\nTurn 19, y=7, choose U, y_{20}=8.\n\nTurn 20, y=8, choose U, y_{21}=9.\n\nTurn 21, y=9, choose S.\n\nAll safe as before.\n\nPerhaps we can have the stay at a different turn, but this works.\n\nSo minimal H=8.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 3, it has two cars same as y=2, but we didn't go there, so fine.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSo I think this is the way.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 3) at turn 14 in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8, the minimal number of turns required is \\(H = 8\\). This means the player reaches (0, 9) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 14 + 8 - 1 = 21\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is designed to avoid dangerous rows at critical times:\n- At turn 16, freeways y=2 and y=3 are dangerous due to car collisions at x=0.\n- At turns 16, 17, and 18, freeway y=7 is dangerous.\n- At turns 16, 17, 18, and 19, freeway y=8 is dangerous.\n\nBy staying at y=6 (which is always safe) during turn 18, the player avoids being on y=7 at turn 18 (dangerous) and proceeds upward when y=7 and y=8 are safe at turns 19 and 20, respectively.\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n- **Turn 14 (current turn)**: Action \\(U\\) (up), moving to y=4 at turn 15. (y=3 at turn 14 is safe.)\n- **Turn 15**: Action \\(U\\), moving to y=5 at turn 16. (y=4 at turn 15 is safe.)\n- **Turn 16**: Action \\(U\\), moving to y=6 at turn 17. (y=5 at turn 16 is safe.)\n- **Turn 17**: Action \\(S\\) (stay), remaining at y=6 for turn 18. (This avoids moving to y=7 at the dangerous turn 18.)\n- **Turn 18**: Action \\(U\\), moving to y=7 at turn 19. (y=6 at turn 18 is safe, and y=7 at turn 19 is safe.)\n- **Turn 19**: Action \\(U\\), moving to y=8 at turn 20. (y=7 at turn 19 is safe, and y=8 at turn 20 is safe.)\n- **Turn 20**: Action \\(U\\), moving to y=9 at turn 21. (y=8 at turn 20 is safe.)\n- **Turn 21**: Action \\(S\\), staying at y=9. (y=9 is the target and has no cars, so it is safe. This action is included to complete the sequence of \\(H = 8\\) actions, but the position (0, 9) is already reached at turn 21.)\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions and reaches (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, \\(H = 8\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 21: S }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,4) at turn 15 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, respectively, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move on specific freeways, and I have to avoid being on a freeway where a car spans x=0 at the turn when I'm on that y-level. Importantly, if I move to a new y at turn T, I'm not on that new y until the next turn, so I only care about the car on the current y-level at each turn.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t1=15, and I need to find where they are at future turns. The car update is linear: for left-moving cars, span moves left by s per turn, for right-moving, it moves right by s per turn.\n\nLet me list all the cars and their states at turn 15:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car, (head=96, tail=49, direction=right, speed=48). But direction is right, so it's moving right. Head and tail: for right-moving, head is the front, so at t=15, it's from τ=49 to h=96? No, the notation says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, span is [τ, h] with τ < h, I assume.\n\nIn the car update, for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h], so at t1, the car occupies from τ to h, and since it's moving right, τ and h increase by s per turn.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it moves left, so h and τ decrease by s per turn.\n\nIn freeway 1: (96, 49, right, 48). But head=96, tail=49, and direction right. Since direction right, head should be the right end, tail left end? But 49 to 96, with tail=49, head=96, so from x=49 to x=96 at t=15. Moving right at speed 48, so after Δt turns, position is [49 + 48*Δt, 96 + 48*Δt].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut I need to find when this car spans x=0.\n\nCollision if at turn T, for the freeway I'm on, there is a car with 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nSince I start at y=4, and need to go to y=9, I have to pass through y=5,6,7,8, but I can skip levels by moving up or down, but since I need to go up, probably moving up is better.\n\nMinimal turns: to go from y=4 to y=9, the minimum moves are 5 up actions, but I might need to wait or something to avoid cars, so H could be more than 5.\n\nBut I need to check for each freeway when it's safe to be there, i.e., when no car spans x=0.\n\nSince I move one y-level per turn only if I change, but I can stay or move, so I might spend multiple turns on one level, but to minimize turns, I probably want to move as much as possible, but I have to avoid the times when cars are at x=0.\n\nSo let's find for each freeway y=1 to 8, the times when it's unsafe, meaning some car has 0 in its span.\n\nStart with freeway 1: y=1\n\nCar: (h=96, τ=49, d=right, s=48)\n\nAt turn T, position: since moving right, span [τ + s*(T-15), h + s*(T-15)] = [49 + 48*(T-15), 96 + 48*(T-15)]\n\nSet 0 in span: 49 + 48*(T-15) ≤ 0 ≤ 96 + 48*(T-15)\n\nSince the car is moving right, and currently at x=49 to 96, both positive, and moving right, so it will never reach x=0 because it's going away from 0. x=0 is left, but it's moving right, so the left end is increasing, so min x is 49 at t=15, increasing, so always x>=49 >0, so never spans x=0. So freeway 1 is always safe. Is that right?\n\nτ + s*(T-15) = 49 + 48*(T-15) ≥ 49 >0 for T≥15, so yes, x_min = 49 +48*(T-15) ≥49>0, so never near x=0. So y=1 is always safe to be on.\n\nBut I start at y=4, and need to go to y=9, so y=1 is below, I might not need to go there, but since it's safe, no issue.\n\nNow freeway 2: y=2\n\nTwo cars: first (-12, -23, right, 12) and second (60, 49, right, 12)\n\nFirst car: head=-12, tail=-23, direction right. Since direction right, span is [τ, h] = [-23, -12] at t=15? Tail τ=-23, head h=-12, so from x=-23 to x=-12.\n\nMoving right at speed 12, so at turn T, span [ -23 + 12*(T-15), -12 + 12*(T-15) ]\n\nSet 0 in span: -23 +12*(T-15) ≤ 0 ≤ -12 +12*(T-15)\n\nSolve inequalities:\n\nLeft: -23 +12*(T-15) ≤ 0 => 12*(T-15) ≤ 23 => T-15 ≤ 23/12 ≈ 1.916, so T ≤ 15 + 1.916 = 16.916, so T ≤ 16 since integer.\n\nT is turn, integer.\n\nSimilarly, right: 0 ≤ -12 +12*(T-15) => 12*(T-15) ≥12 => T-15 ≥1 => T ≥16\n\nSo 0 in span when T ≥16 and T ≤16.916, so only at T=16.\n\nT ≥16 and T ≤16.916, so T=16.\n\nAt T=16: left end = -23 +12*(1) = -23+12= -11\n\nRight end = -12 +12*1 = 0\n\nSo span [-11, 0], so x=0 is included since right end=0.\n\nSimilarly, for other T, not.\n\nNow second car on y=2: (60,49,right,12)\n\nAt t=15, span [49,60]? Tail=49, head=60, so [49,60]\n\nMoving right, at T, [49 +12*(T-15), 60 +12*(T-15)]\n\nMin x=49+12*(T-15) ≥49>0, so never near 0.\n\nSo for freeway 2, only the first car can cause issue at T=16.\n\nUnsafe at T=16 only.\n\nNow freeway 3: y=3\n\nCars: (-12,-23,right,12) and (60,49,right,12) same as y=2.\n\nSo identical to freeway 2, unsafe only at T=16.\n\nNow freeway 4: y=4\n\nCar: (-60,-25,left,36)\n\nDirection left, so moving left.\n\nAt t=15, head=-60, tail=-25? For left-moving, in the update it says: left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ] → [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\nIn the problem: \"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\"\n\nAnd it says \"head h, tail τ\", but for left-moving, which is front? Typically, for left-moving, head is left, I think.\n\nIn the span, it says [h, τ] for left-moving, and [τ, h] for right-moving.\n\nFor left-moving at t=15: h=-60, τ=-25, so [h, τ] = [-60, -25], which from -60 to -25, so head at -60, tail at -25? But moving left, so head should be left.\n\nAt T, span [ -60 -36*(T-15), -25 -36*(T-15) ]\n\nSet 0 in span: -60 -36*(T-15) ≤ 0 ≤ -25 -36*(T-15)\n\nSince moving left, both ends decreasing.\n\nFirst inequality: -60 -36*(T-15) ≤ 0 => -36*(T-15) ≤ 60 => multiply by -1, reverse inequality: 36*(T-15) ≥ -60? Better to handle signs.\n\n-60 -36Δt ≤ 0 => -36Δt ≤ 60 => multiply by -1: 36Δt ≥ -60, but Δt = T-15 ≥0, so 36Δt ≥ -60 always true since left side non-neg.\n\n-60 -36Δt ≤ 0 is always true because -60 -36Δt ≤ -60 <0.\n\nNow second inequality: 0 ≤ -25 -36Δt => 0 ≤ -25 -36Δt => 25 +36Δt ≤ 0? No.\n\n0 ≤ -25 -36Δt => add 25: 25 ≤ -36Δt? That can't be, since Δt≥0.\n\n0 ≤ -25 -36Δt, but -25 -36Δt ≤ -25 <0, so 0 ≤ negative number is false. So never true.\n\nThus, 0 is never in the span because the car is at negative x, moving left, so x decreasing, always left of 0.\n\nSpecifically, left end: -60 -36Δt ≤ -60 <0, right end: -25 -36Δt ≤ -25 <0, so both negative, never reach 0. So freeway 4 is always safe.\n\nBut y=4 is where I start, at t=15, I'm on y=4.\n\nNow, at turn T, when I am on a freeway, I need no car at x=0.\n\nAt t=15, I am on y=4, and freeway 4 has car at [-60,-25] which is left of 0, so 0 not in span, so safe. Similarly for future, always safe as above.\n\nNow freeway 5: y=5\n\nCar: (-60,-25,left,36) same as y=4.\n\nSo identical, always safe.\n\nNow freeway 6: y=6\n\nCar: (42,31,right,6)\n\nTail=31, head=42, direction right, so span [31,42] at t=15.\n\nMoving right, at T, [31 +6*(T-15), 42 +6*(T-15)]\n\nMin x=31+6*(T-15) ≥31>0, so never near 0. Always safe.\n\nNow freeway 7: y=7\n\nCars: (-4,-15,right,4) and (60,49,right,4)\n\nFirst car: tail=-15, head=-4, direction right, so span [-15,-4] at t=15.\n\nMoving right, at T, [ -15 +4*(T-15), -4 +4*(T-15) ]\n\nSet 0 in span: -15 +4*(T-15) ≤ 0 ≤ -4 +4*(T-15)\n\nLeft: -15 +4Δt ≤ 0 => 4Δt ≤ 15 => Δt ≤ 15/4 = 3.75, so T-15 ≤ 3.75, T ≤ 18.75, thus T≤18\n\nRight: 0 ≤ -4 +4Δt => 4 ≤ 4Δt => Δt ≥1, T≥16\n\nSo for T from 16 to 18 inclusive.\n\nAt T=16: left = -15+4= -11, right= -4+4=0, span [-11,0], includes 0.\n\nT=17: left=-15+8= -7, right=-4+8=4, span [-7,4], includes 0.\n\nT=18: left=-15+12= -3, right=-4+12=8, span [-3,8], includes 0.\n\nT=19: left=-15+16=1, right=-4+16=12, span [1,12], min=1>0, no.\n\nSecond car: (60,49,right,4), span [49,60] at t=15, moving right, min x=49+4Δt>0, always safe.\n\nSo for y=7, unsafe at T=16,17,18.\n\nNow freeway 8: y=8\n\nCar: (-3,-14,right,3)\n\nTail=-14, head=-3, direction right, so span [-14,-3] at t=15.\n\nMoving right, at T, [ -14 +3*(T-15), -3 +3*(T-15) ]\n\nSet 0 in span: -14 +3Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -3 +3Δt\n\nLeft: -14 +3Δt ≤ 0 => 3Δt ≤14 => Δt ≤14/3≈4.666, T≤19.666, T≤19\n\nRight: 0 ≤ -3 +3Δt => 3 ≤ 3Δt => Δt ≥1, T≥16\n\nSo T from 16 to 19 inclusive.\n\nAt T=16: left=-14+3= -11, right=-3+3=0, span [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nT=17: left=-14+6= -8, right=-3+6=3, span [-8,3], 0 included.\n\nT=18: left=-14+9= -5, right=-3+9=6, span [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nT=19: left=-14+12= -2, right=-3+12=9, span [-2,9], 0 included.\n\nT=20: left=-14+15=1, right=-3+15=12, span [1,12], min>0, safe.\n\nSo y=8 unsafe at T=16,17,18,19.\n\nNow, summarize unsafe times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: always safe\n\n- y=2: unsafe only at T=16\n\n- y=3: unsafe only at T=16\n\n- y=4: always safe\n\n- y=5: always safe\n\n- y=6: always safe\n\n- y=7: unsafe at T=16,17,18\n\n- y=8: unsafe at T=16,17,18,19\n\nI start at t=15, y=4, which is safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn, but y=9 is not a freeway, it's the top, no cars, so always safe.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, no cars.\n\ny=0: not mentioned, but probably no cars or safe, similarly y=9.\n\nIn player update, y=0 to 9, and cars on y=1 to 8.\n\nSo y=0 and y=9 should be safe to be on.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=4 to y=9.\n\nEach move changes y by at most 1, so minimum 5 moves up.\n\nBut I may need to avoid being on certain y at certain times.\n\nSince I start at t=15, y=4.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at turn t=15+H-1, and the sequence of actions from t=15 to t=15+H-1.\n\nPosition after action: at turn t, I perform action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nAnd at turn t, I am at y_t, and I check collision based on y_t and the cars on that freeway at turn t.\n\nIn the collision rule: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nSo at turn T, I am at position (0, y_T), and I need no car on freeway y_T to have 0 in its span at that exact turn T.\n\nAlso, when I move, at turn T, if I move to a new y, I am not on that new y until T+1, so at turn T, I am still on old y.\n\nNow, to minimize H, the number of turns from start to end.\n\nStart turn is t1=15, I perform actions from t=15 to t=15+H-1, and at turn t=15+H-1, I should be at y=9.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, so H actions? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t, I perform a_t, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nAt turn t=15, I start at y=4.\n\nAfter action a_{15}, y_{16} is set.\n\nI need y_{t} for t from 15 to some T, and at turn T, y_T=9.\n\nSince I end at turn T with y_T=9, and I perform actions from t=15 to t=T-1? Let's clarify the indexing.\n\nThe player position at turn t is given, and after action a_t, y_{t+1} is updated.\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t, and I choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nCollision is checked at turn t based on y_t and cars at turn t.\n\nI need to reach a state where at some turn T, y_T = 9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1, and after H actions, I am at y=9 at turn t1+H.\n\nSet t1=15.\n\nAt turn 15, y_15=4.\n\nAfter action a_15, y_16 = y_15 + Δy_15.\n\nSimilarly, after a_16, y_17, and so on, up to after a_{15+H-1}, y_{15+H}.\n\nI need y_{15+H} = 9.\n\nAnd at each turn t from 15 to 15+H-1, when I am at y_t, it must be safe, no collision.\n\nAt turn t=15+H, I am at y=9, which is safe, but since no freeway, no collision check, I think. The collision is only for freeways y=1-8, so y=9 is fine.\n\nSo for turns t=15 to t=15+H-1, I need y_t safe, and y_{15+H} =9.\n\nThe actions are for t=15 to t=15+H-1.\n\nH is the number of turns, from start to end.\n\nIn the sequence, it says {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for t from 0 to H-1, a_{t1 + t}, so actions at time t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter these actions, at time t1+H, position is updated to y=9.\n\nWith y_{t1} given.\n\nSo here, t1=15, y_15=4.\n\nAfter actions a_15 to a_{15+H-1}, y_{15+H} =9.\n\nAnd for each τ from 15 to 15+H-1, at turn τ, y_τ must be safe (no collision on that freeway at turn τ).\n\ny_τ for τ=15 to 15+H-1 must be between 0 and 9, and safe.\n\nNow, y_{15+H} =9, which is safe.\n\nI need to go from y=4 to y=9 in H steps, meaning the sum of Δy must be +5, since each |Δy|<=1, so H >=5.\n\nMinimal H is 5 if I can move up each time without collision.\n\nBut I have to check the unsafe times.\n\nStart at t=15, y=4, which is safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9 by t=15+H.\n\nSince y=4 to y=9, I must increase y by 5, so I need at least 5 up moves.\n\nI can have down or stay, but that would increase H, so to minimize H, I should avoid down and stay if possible, only use up.\n\nBut I may need to stay or move down to avoid being on a dangerous y at dangerous time.\n\nFirst, let's see if I can go directly up in 5 turns.\n\nStart t=15, y=4.\n\nAction a_15: if U, then y_16=5\n\nBut at t=16, if I am on y=5, is it safe?\n\ny=5: freeway 5, which is always safe, as we saw.\n\nEarlier: y=5 always safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 always safe.\n\nBut at t=16, if I am on y=5, freeway 5 is safe, so ok.\n\nThen a_16: U, y_17=6\n\nt=17, y=6, freeway 6 always safe.\n\na_17: U, y_18=7\n\nt=18, y=7, freeway 7: unsafe at t=16,17,18.\n\nt=18 is unsafe for y=7.\n\nIf I am on y=7 at t=18, collision.\n\nIn this path: at t=18, y=7, but unsafe.\n\na_18: U, y_19=8\n\nt=19, y=8, freeway 8 unsafe at t=16,17,18,19, so t=19 unsafe.\n\na_19: U, y_20=9, done.\n\nBut at t=18 and t=19, I would be on unsafe y.\n\nSpecifically, in this sequence:\n\nt=15: y=4, safe\n\na_15: U, y_16=5\n\nt=16: y=5, safe (y=5 always safe)\n\na_16: U, y_17=6\n\nt=17: y=6, safe (y=6 always safe)\n\na_17: U, y_18=7\n\nt=18: y=7, but y=7 unsafe at t=18, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf I do something else.\n\nPerhaps stay or move down to avoid.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nSince y=7 is unsafe from t=16 to 18, and y=8 from t=16 to 19.\n\nI start at t=15, y=4.\n\ny=4 is safe always.\n\nI can stay at y=4 for some turns, but that increases H.\n\nSimilarly, I can go to y=3 or y=2, but y=2 and y=3 are unsafe at t=16, but safe otherwise.\n\ny=2 unsafe only t=16, y=3 same.\n\ny=1 always safe.\n\nBut I need to go up, so going down might not help.\n\nMinimal H: since I must be at y=9, and from y=4, min 5 up moves.\n\nBut with constraints.\n\nThe dangerous times are around t=16 to 19.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=7 at t=16,17,18 and on y=8 at t=16,17,18,19.\n\ny=7 unsafe t=16,17,18\n\ny=8 unsafe t=16,17,18,19\n\nNow, at t=15, I am on y=4, safe.\n\nIf I move up at t=15 to y=5 at t=16.\n\nt=16: y=5, safe.\n\nNow, from here, if I move up to y=6 at t=17.\n\nt=17: y=6, safe.\n\nNow at t=17, I am on y=6, I want to go to y=7, but if I move up, y_18=7, then at t=18, y=7, unsafe.\n\nI could stay at y=6 for a turn.\n\na_17: S, then y_18=6, still on y=6 at t=18, which is safe.\n\nThen at t=18, I can move up to y=7, but at t=19, y=7.\n\ny=7 is unsafe only up to t=18, at t=19 it is safe? Earlier for y=7, unsafe t=16,17,18, safe at t=19 and after.\n\ny=7: car spans, at t=19: first car left= -15 +4*(19-15)= -15+16=1, right= -4+16=12, span [1,12], not include 0, safe.\n\nSecond car always safe.\n\nSo at t=19, y=7 safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 unsafe until t=19, at t=20 safe.\n\nBack to sequence.\n\nAt t=17, if I stay: a_17=S, y_18=6\n\nt=18: y=6, safe\n\nThen a_18: U, y_19=7\n\nt=19: y=7, now at t=19, y=7 is safe, as above.\n\nThen a_19: U, y_20=8\n\nt=20: y=8, now y=8 at t=20: earlier, at t=20, span left= -14 +3*(20-15)= -14+15=1, right= -3+15=12, span [1,12], min>0, safe.\n\nThen a_20: U, y_21=9\n\nNow, I reached y=9 at t=21.\n\nBut H: from t=15 to t=20, actions a_15 to a_20, that's 6 actions? Turns: actions at t=15,16,17,18,19,20, and y_21=9.\n\nSo H=6? Number of actions: from t=15 to t=20 inclusive, 6 actions, but t=15 to t=20 is 6 turns? Let's index.\n\nStart: turn t=15, position y_15=4\n\nAfter a_15: y_16\n\nAfter a_16: y_17\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{20}: y_21=9\n\nActions from t=15 to t=20, that's 6 actions: t=15,16,17,18,19,20.\n\nBut H is the minimal number such that after H actions, y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nt1=15, so y_{15+H} =9.\n\nHere y_21=9, so 15+H=21, H=6.\n\nBut earlier I thought min 5, but with 5 I had collision.\n\nIn this sequence: H=6.\n\nBut let me write the sequence:\n\nt=15: at y=4, safe. Action a_15=U, to y_16=5\n\nt=16: y=5, safe. Action a_16=U, to y_17=6\n\nt=17: y=6, safe. Action a_17=S, to y_18=6 (stay)\n\nt=18: y=6, safe. Action a_18=U, to y_19=7\n\nt=19: y=7, safe (t=19>18). Action a_19=U, to y_20=8\n\nt=20: y=8, safe (t=20>19). Action a_20=U, to y_21=9\n\ny_21=9, done.\n\nH=6 turns? Actions from t=15 to t=20, that's 6 actions, H=6.\n\nBut can I do with H=5?\n\nSuppose I start at t=15, y=4.\n\nIf I don't move up immediately.\n\nFor example, stay at y=4 for one turn.\n\na_15=S, then y_16=4\n\nt=16: y=4, safe (always safe)\n\nThen a_16=U, y_17=5\n\nt=17: y=5, safe\n\na_17=U, y_18=6\n\nt=18: y=6, safe\n\na_18=U, y_19=7\n\nt=19: y=7, safe (t=19 safe for y=7)\n\nThen a_19=U, y_20=8\n\nt=20: y=8, at t=20, y=8 safe? Yes, as above.\n\nThen a_20=U, y_21=9, same as before, H=6.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9 earlier.\n\nAt t=19, if I could be at y=8, but y=8 unsafe at t=19.\n\nIn the above, at t=19 I am at y=7, then to y=8 at t=20.\n\nTo reach y=9 by t=20, say.\n\ny_{15+H}=9.\n\nIf H=5, then y_{20}=9.\n\nSo I need to be at y=9 at turn 20.\n\nThat means at turn 19, I must be at y=8 or y=9, but since I start from below, y=8, and move up to y=9 at t=20.\n\ny_{20}=9, so at turn 20, position is (0,9).\n\nTo get there, at turn 19, I am at some y_{19}, and I perform a_{19}, then y_{20}=y_{19} + Δy_{19}.\n\nIf y_{20}=9, then y_{19} must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y_{19}=9, then I can stay or move, but to reach exactly, if I am at 9, I can stay.\n\nBut I need to arrive at 9, so probably y_{19}=8 and a_{19}=U.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, for H=5, y_{20}=9.\n\nSo actions from t=15 to t=19, 5 actions.\n\ny_{20}=9.\n\nNow, at each turn t=15 to 19, y_t must be safe.\n\nt=15: y=4, safe.\n\nt=16: y_16 must be safe.\n\nt=17: y_17 safe\n\nt=18: y_18 safe\n\nt=19: y_19 safe\n\nAnd y_{20}=9.\n\nNow, y_t must go from 4 to, at t=19, y_19=8 to have y_20=9 with U.\n\ny_19 could be 9, but if I reach earlier, but since min time, probably not.\n\nAssume y_19=8.\n\nSo I need to be at y=8 at turn 19.\n\nBut y=8 is unsafe at t=19.\n\nSpecifically, at t=19, y=8 is unsafe.\n\nIf I am on y=8 at t=19, collision.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be on y=8 at t=19.\n\nSimilarly, if I am on y=9 at t=19, but y=9 no freeway, safe, but to be on y=9 at t=19, I need to arrive earlier.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nTo have y_{20}=9, y_{19} must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y_{19}=9, then I reached earlier, but with H=5, if y_{19}=9, then I could have stopped earlier, but since min turns to reach, if I reach at t=19, H would be less, but let's see.\n\ny_{t} at turn t.\n\nIf at turn t=19, y_{19}=9, then I have reached, so for H=4, y_{19}=9? Let's not confuse.\n\nTarget is to reach at some turn T with y_T=9.\n\nWith H actions, I reach at turn t1+H.\n\nIf I reach earlier, H smaller.\n\nBut in this case, from y=4 at t=15, min to y=9 is 5 up moves, so cannot reach before t=20.\n\nAt t=15, y=4.\n\nAfter one action, t=16, y=16 <=5\n\nAfter two, t=17, y<=6\n\nAfter three, t=18, y<=7\n\nAfter four, t=19, y<=8\n\nAfter five, t=20, y<=9\n\nSo earliest to reach y=9 is at t=20, with y_20=9, after 5 actions from t=15 to t=19.\n\ny_20=9 requires that at t=19, y_19=8 and a_19=U, or y_19=9 and a_19=S or something, but since min, assume y_19=8, a_19=U.\n\nSimilarly, if y_19=9, I reached at t=19, but with fewer actions? At t=19, y_19=9, reached after 4 actions? Actions from t=15 to t=18, y_19=9.\n\nBut from y=4 to y=9 in 4 moves? Only if I move up each time, but y increases by at most 1 per move, so from 4 to 9, min 5 moves: to 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nAfter k actions, y_{15+k} can be at most 4+k.\n\nSet y_{15+k} =9, so 4+k >=9, k>=5.\n\nSimilarly, at least 5 actions to reach y=9.\n\nEarliest at t=20 with y_20=9, after actions a_15 to a_19.\n\nNow, for that, y_19 must be 8, and a_19=U.\n\nNow, at turn t=19, I must be on y=8, but y=8 is unsafe at t=19.\n\nTherefore, collision at t=19 if on y=8.\n\nHence, impossible to reach y=9 at t=20 with H=5, because I must be on y=8 at t=19, which is unsafe.\n\nIf I reach y=9 earlier, but impossible, min t=20.\n\nSo H=5 is impossible.\n\nThus minimal H is 6, reaching at t=21.\n\nWith sequences like above.\n\nIn my first sequence with H=6.\n\nBut in that sequence, I had a stay at t=17.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid stay by going to other levels.\n\nFor example, since y=1,2,3 are safe except t=16, and I can use them.\n\nBut since I need to go up, going down might cost more turns.\n\nFor instance, at t=15, instead of up, I go down to y=3.\n\nBut y=3 unsafe at t=16.\n\nt=15: y=4, safe.\n\na_15=D, y_16=3\n\nt=16: y=3, but y=3 unsafe at t=16, collision! Not good.\n\na_15=S, y_16=4\n\nt=16: y=4, safe.\n\nThen a_16=U, y_17=5\n\nt=17: y=5, safe\n\na_17=U, y_18=6\n\nt=18: y=6, safe\n\na_18=U, y_19=7\n\nt=19: y=7, safe (since t=19>18)\n\na_19=U, y_20=8\n\nt=20: y=8, safe (t=20>19)\n\na_20=U, y_21=9\n\nSame as before, H=6.\n\nIn this, I stayed at t=15? No, in this I did S at t=15, but in previous I did U at t=15 to y=5.\n\nBut both end up with similar.\n\nIn the sequence where I go up immediately but stay at y=6 for one turn.\n\nBut H=6 in both cases.\n\nCan I reach faster by going to y=9 at t=20? But we saw impossible.\n\nPerhaps by moving down and up, but that might take more turns.\n\nFor example, go to y=5 at t=16, but then if I go to y=6 at t=17, etc., I still hit the unsafe times.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 are only unsafe until t=18 and t=19 respectively, but at t=19 y=7 safe, t=20 y=8 safe.\n\nSo the critical point is to be on y=7 after t=18, and y=8 after t=19.\n\nIn the path, I need to delay reaching y=7 until t=19 or later.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nIn the sequence, from start, I can go to y=5 at t=16, y=6 at t=17, then I need to be on y=6 at t=18, then to y=7 at t=19.\n\nAs I had.\n\nIf I go slower, H larger.\n\nSo H=6 seems minimal.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I need to output the actions.\n\nIn the first sequence I thought: a_15=U, a_16=U, a_17=S, a_18=U, a_19=U, a_20=U\n\nThen y: t15=4, t16=5, t17=6 (after a_16 U), at t=17 y=6, a_17=S, so y_18=6, t=18 y=6, a_18=U, y_19=7, t=19 y=7, a_19=U, y_20=8, t=20 y=8, a_20=U, y_21=9.\n\nReached at t=21.\n\nWith stay at t=17.\n\nIn the other sequence: a_15=S, a_16=U, a_17=U, a_18=U, a_19=U, a_20=U\n\ny: t15=4, a_15=S, y_16=4, t16=4, a_16=U, y_17=5, t17=5, a_17=U, y_18=6, t18=6, a_18=U, y_19=7, t19=7, a_19=U, y_20=8, t20=8, a_20=U, y_21=9.\n\nSame H=6.\n\nIn this case, no down, only up and one stay.\n\nBut in the first, stay later; in second, stay earlier.\n\nBut H same.\n\nPerhaps I can do without stay, but with down, but that might not help.\n\nFor example, at t=17, instead of stay, go down to y=5? But then I have to come back, more turns.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo minimal H is 6.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I need to output the actions.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be for each turn.\n\nAlso, in the sequence, I need to specify the actions.\n\nBut in the second sequence, I have a_15=S, which is stay, but I could have a_15=U, but then I need to stay later.\n\nEither way.\n\nBut let me confirm if at all points safe.\n\nFirst sequence: a_15=U, a_16=U, a_17=S, a_18=U, a_19=U, a_20=U\n\nTurns:\n\nt=15: y=4, safe\n\na_15=U → y_16=5\n\nt=16: y=5, safe (y=5 always safe)\n\na_16=U → y_17=6\n\nt=17: y=6, safe\n\na_17=S → y_18=6\n\nt=18: y=6, safe\n\na_18=U → y_19=7\n\nt=19: y=7, safe (t=19, y=7 safe)\n\na_19=U → y_20=8\n\nt=20: y=8, safe (t=20, y=8 safe)\n\na_20=U → y_21=9\n\nAll safe.\n\nWith a_15=S: t=15 y=4 safe, a_15=S → y_16=4, t=16 y=4 safe, etc., also safe.\n\nBut in the first one, I moved up earlier.\n\nSince both work, I can choose one.\n\nBut in terms of minimal H, same.\n\nNow, the player might be able to move faster, but no.\n\nAnother thing: freeway y=2 and y=3 have unsafe only at t=16, but since I start at y=4 and go up, I might not need to go there.\n\nBut if I go down, it costs extra.\n\nSo not beneficial.\n\nThus H=6 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I think I need to write it.\n\nBut in the output, it should be for turns starting from t1=15.\n\nAlso, in the car state, freeway 3 has same as 2, but I didn't use it.\n\nNow, the answer should be the sequence.\n\nPerhaps I can write with a_15=U.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: S\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nThen after Turn 20 action, y=9 at turn 21.\n\nBut the sequence is actions from t=15 to t=20, 6 actions.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me confirm the turn numbering.\n\nCurrent turn is t1=15.\n\nActions: a_{15}, a_{16}, ..., up to a_{15+H-1}\n\nWith H=6, so actions from t=15 to t=15+5=20.\n\nAfter a_{20}, y_{21}=9.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I can reach without stay by using different path.\n\nFor example, go to y=5 at t=16, then to y=4? But not helpful.\n\nOr at t=17, go to y=7 directly? But I can only change by 1, so no.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=17 I stay, but I could have moved up, but unsafe.\n\nUnless I can be on y=7 at t=19 directly, but from t=17 y=6, I can go to y=7 at t=18, but t=18 unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nSo the stay is necessary to avoid t=18 on y=7.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think H=6 is minimal.\n\nNow for the output.\n\nThe answer format should be:\n\n\\boxed{  \nTurn 15: U  \nTurn 16: U  \nTurn 17: S  \nTurn 18: U  \nTurn 19: U  \nTurn 20: U  \n}\n\nBut let me write the actions clearly.\n\nIn the sequence, Turn t1: a_{t1}, etc.\n\nt1=15.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that at no point I go below 0 or above 9, but in this sequence, y from 4 to 5,6,6,7,8,9, all within 0-9.\n\ny=6 twice, but fine.\n\nTo avoid stay, but not possible with H=5.\n\nAnother idea: since y=1 is always safe, but going down to y=1 would take extra turns, not good.\n\nFor example, at t=15, go down to y=3, but at t=16, y=3 unsafe, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nGo to y=5 at t=16, then down to y=4 at t=17, but then I waste turns.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo I think the sequence is fine.\n\nPerhaps I can move up faster but skip levels, but I can only change by 1, so no.\n\nSo I think this is it.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 15\\) is 6.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,5) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t1=16, and I start at y=5.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at each future turn. The cars move with constant speed, either left or right, and I need to avoid being on a freeway where a car spans x=0 at that turn.\n\nThe collision condition is that at turn T, if I'm on freeway y_T, and for any car on that freeway, 0 is in the span of the car at turn T. The span is given by the head and tail positions.\n\nAlso, note that when I move to a new freeway, I'm not considered on that freeway until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1. So I only check the freeway I'm currently on for collisions.\n\nThe player position updates at the same time as the cars, I assume. So at each turn, I choose an action, which changes my y position for the next turn, but during the turn, I'm still on the current y.\n\nThe update is: at turn t, I choose action a_t, which determines Δy_t, and then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nBut for collision, at turn T, it depends on y_T, which is the position at the start of the turn? Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the player's position at turn T, I think.\n\nThe player position is given at turn t1 as (0, y_{t1}), so y_t is the vertical position at turn t.\n\nAt turn T, player is at (0, y_T), and we check if for that freeway y_T, there is a car whose span includes x=0 at that turn T.\n\nThe span changes with time based on the speed and direction.\n\nAlso, the cars are listed for each freeway k from 1 to 8, with multiple cars possible.\n\nIn the table, for each freeway, there are cars with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: right means moving right, so for right-moving, span is [tail, head] at t1, and at time T, it's [tail + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, direction left, span [head, tail] at t1, and at T, [head - s*(T-t1), tail - s*(T-t1)].\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nDirection right, so at t1=16, span is [τ, h] = [-95, -48], since tail is -95, head is -48, and moving right.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, like freeway 4: (48, 83, left, 36), so head=48, tail=83? That seems odd.\n\nLet's read: \"head h, tail τ\"\n\nFor right-moving, it should be tail to head, with tail < head, I assume.\n\nIn freeway 1: head=-48, tail=-95, and since direction right, tail should be left, head right, so tail < head? -95 < -48, yes, since -95 is more negative.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: head=48, tail=83, direction left. Left-moving should have head left, tail right? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFrom the update: left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nRight-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nSo for right-moving, at t1, the car is from τ to h, with τ ≤ h, and it moves right, so both increase.\n\nFor left-moving, at t1, it's from h to τ, but in the notation, for freeway 4: (48, 83, left, 36), so h=48, τ=83, and since direction left, Span(t1) = [h, τ] = [48, 83], so from x=48 to x=83, and moving left, so at time T, [48 - s(T-t1), 83 - s(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 1: right, (h=-48, τ=-95), so Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-95, -48], moving right, so at T, [-95 + s(T-t1), -48 + s(T-t1)].\n\nNow, collision at turn T on freeway y if 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nI need to go from y=5 to y=9 in min turns, avoiding collisions.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and freeways are from 1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think, no cars there, so safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are the banks, probably safe.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,5), which is on freeway y=5? y=5 is a freeway, but the position is (0,5), x=0.\n\nFreeways are at y=1 to 8, each with cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, so if I'm at y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nBut I start at y=5, and need to reach y=9.\n\ny from 0 to 9, so y=9 is the top.\n\nActions: U for up (y+1), D for down (y-1), S for stay (y same).\n\ny must be in [0,9], so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nNow, to minimize H, the number of turns to reach y=9.\n\nSince I start at y=5, and need to go to y=9, the minimum number of moves is 4, if I go up four times: U,U,U,U.\n\nBut I might have to avoid cars, so I might need to stay or go down sometimes, or delay.\n\nH is the number of turns, including the starting turn? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is from t= t1 to t1 + H -1, so H turns, from turn t1 to turn t1 + H -1.\n\nAt turn t1, I am at position y_{t1} =5.\n\nAfter H turns, at turn t1 + H -1, I should be at y=9.\n\nThe actions are for turns t1 to t1 + H -1, which determine y_{t1+1} to y_{t1 + H}.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, I am at position y_t.\n\nI choose action a_t, which determines Δy_t, so that at the end of the turn, or beginning of next turn, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t, for collision, I am on freeway y_t, and we check if 0 is in the span of cars on y_t at turn t.\n\nThe note says: if I move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, I am not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so only check y_T.\n\nSo during turn T, I am on y_T.\n\nNow, at turn t1 + H -1, I should be at y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSince I start at t1, y_{t1} =5.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=t1 to t=t1 + H -1 will move me to y_{t1 + H} = y_{t1} + sum of Δy from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nI need y_{t1 + H} =9? No.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThe last turn is turn t1 + H -1, and at that turn, I am at y_{t1 + H -1}, and I want this to be 9.\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + H -1}, I go to y_{t1 + H}, but we don't care about that, since we only need to reach (0,9) at some turn.\n\nThe position is (0, y_t) at turn t.\n\nWe need to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1, meaning y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAnd H is the number of turns from t1 to t1+H-1 inclusive, so H actions.\n\nFor example, if H=1, then at turn t1, I need to be at y=9, but I am at y=5, so impossible with one action. Min H is 4, since I need to move up 4 times.\n\nBut I might need to stay or go down to avoid cars, so H could be more.\n\nFirst, let's list the cars and when they are at x=0 for each freeway.\n\nI need to know for each freeway and each future turn, whether x=0 is occupied by a car.\n\nSince the cars move linearly, I can find the times when a car spans x=0.\n\nFor a given car on a freeway, the span at time T relative to t1.\n\nSet τ = T - t1, so τ=0 at current turn t1.\n\nFor a car, at τ, the span for right-moving: [τ + s τ, h + s τ] at time T, since T-t1 = τ.\n\nRight-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)] = [τ + s τ, h + s τ] where τ = T-t1.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: [h - s τ, τ - s τ]? No.\n\nLeft-moving: Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)] = [h - s τ, τ - s τ]\n\nBut in the span, it's an interval, and we care if 0 is in [low, high].\n\nFor right-moving, low = τ + s τ, high = h + s τ\n\nSince for right-moving, at τ=0, low = τ, high = h, and τ < h usually.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, at τ=0, low = h, high = τ? No.\n\nFor left-moving, at τ=0, Span = [h, τ], and since moving left, h is the left end, τ is the right end, so low = h, high = τ, and h ≤ τ.\n\nIn freeway 4, h=48, τ=83, so low=48, high=83.\n\nAt τ, low = h - s τ, high = τ - s τ.\n\n0 is in the span if low ≤ 0 ≤ high.\n\nSo for each car, I can solve for τ when low ≤ 0 ≤ high.\n\nThen for that freeway, if any car has 0 in span at τ, then it's occupied at that turn.\n\nSince multiple cars, I need to see for each freeway, for each τ, if there is a car with 0 in span.\n\nτ is discrete, turns.\n\nNow, let's list all cars for each freeway.\n\nCurrent turn t1=16, so τ = T - 16.\n\nFreeway 1: only one car: (-48, -95, right, 48)\n\nSo right-moving, low at τ: τ + s τ = -95 + 48 τ\n\nHigh: h + s τ = -48 + 48 τ\n\n0 in span if -95 + 48τ ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 48τ\n\nFirst inequality: -95 + 48τ ≤ 0 => 48τ ≤ 95 => τ ≤ 95/48 ≈ 1.979, so τ ≤ 1 since integer\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -48 + 48τ => 48τ ≥ 48 => τ ≥ 1\n\nSo τ=1, both: τ≥1 and τ≤1.979, so τ=1\n\nAt τ=1, low = -95 + 48*1 = -95+48= -47\n\nHigh = -48 +48=0\n\n0 ≤ 0 ≤ 0? 0 is included, I think, since span is inclusive.\n\nThe inequality is ≤ and ≥, so yes, 0 is included when high=0.\n\nSimilarly, low=-47 ≤0, so 0 in [-47, 0], yes.\n\nAt τ=0, low=-95, high=-48, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nAt τ=2, low=-95+96=1, high=-48+96=48, 0 not in [1,48].\n\nSo only at τ=1, which is turn T= t1 + τ =16+1=17, freeway 1 is occupied at x=0.\n\nτ=1, T=17.\n\nNow, freeway 2: two cars\n\nFirst car: (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nRight-moving, so at τ, low = τ + s τ = -11 + 12τ\n\nHigh = h + s τ = 0 + 12τ = 12τ\n\n0 in span if -11 +12τ ≤ 0 ≤ 12τ\n\nFirst: -11+12τ ≤0 => 12τ ≤11 => τ ≤ 11/12 <1, so τ=0? τ integer, τ≤0.916, so τ≤0\n\nBut τ=0: low=-11+0=-11, high=0, 0≤0≤0? 0 in [-11,0], yes.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ 12τ, which for τ=0, 0≤0, true.\n\nFor τ=0: -11 ≤0 ≤0, yes.\n\nNow τ=1: low=-11+12=1, high=12, 0 not in [1,12]\n\nτ negative not possible.\n\nSo at τ=0, occupied.\n\nBut τ=0 is current turn, t1=16.\n\nAt turn T=16, freeway 2 has a car at x=0? But I am not on freeway 2 now, I am on y=5.\n\nFor freeway 2, at τ=0 (T=16), car 1: low= τ + s τ, at τ=0, low= -11 +0 = -11, high=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 is included.\n\nAlso, second car: (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nRight-moving, low = τ + s τ = -59 + 12τ\n\nHigh = h + s τ = -48 +12τ\n\n0 in span if -59 +12τ ≤ 0 ≤ -48 +12τ\n\nFirst: -59+12τ ≤0 => 12τ ≤59 => τ ≤ 59/12 ≈4.916, so τ≤4\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48 +12τ => 12τ ≥48 => τ ≥4\n\nSo τ=4, low=-59+48= -11, high=-48+48=0, 0 in [-11,0]\n\nAt τ=4, T=16+4=20.\n\nBut for freeway 2, at τ=0, car 1 is at x=0.\n\nNow, back to car 1 on freeway 2 at τ=0: occupied.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: same as freeway 2? Let's see.\n\nFreeway 3: (0, -11, right, 12), and (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nSame as freeway 2.\n\nSo at τ=0, car 1 occupied, and at τ=4, car 2 occupied.\n\nτ=4 is T=20.\n\nNow freeway 4: (48, 83, left, 36)\n\nLeft-moving, so low = h - s τ = 48 - 36τ\n\nHigh = τ - s τ? τ is tail? Span [h - s τ, τ - s τ]\n\nh=48, τ=83, s=36\n\nLow = 48 - 36τ\n\nHigh = 83 - 36τ\n\n0 in span if 48 -36τ ≤ 0 ≤ 83 -36τ\n\nFirst inequality: 48-36τ ≤0 => 48≤36τ => τ ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so τ≥2 since integer? τ≥2\n\nτ ≥ ceil(4/3) = 2? 4/3=1.333, so τ≥2\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ 83 -36τ => 36τ ≤83 => τ ≤ 83/36 ≈2.305, so τ≤2\n\nThus τ=2, low=48-72= -24, high=83-72=11, 0 in [-24,11] yes.\n\nAt τ=2, T=18.\n\nNow freeway 5: same as freeway 4? (48, 83, left, 36) identical, so also occupied at τ=2, T=18.\n\nFreeway 6: (48, 37, right, 6) head=48, tail=37? But for right-moving, usually tail < head, but here tail=37, head=48, and direction right, so span [τ,h] = [37,48] at τ=0.\n\nMoving right, so at τ, low = τ + s τ = 37 + 6τ\n\nHigh = h + s τ = 48 + 6τ\n\nNow, 0 in [37+6τ, 48+6τ]? Since 37+6τ ≥37>0 for τ≥0, so always positive, never 0. So freeway 6 never occupied at x=0.\n\nGood.\n\nFreeway 7: two cars: (0, -11, right, 4) and (-48, -59, right, 4)\n\nFirst car: right, (0, -11, right, 4) so head=0, tail=-11? At τ=0, span [τ,h] = [-11,0]\n\nLow = τ + s τ = -11 +4τ\n\nHigh = h + s τ = 0 +4τ =4τ\n\n0 in span if -11+4τ ≤0 ≤4τ\n\nFirst: -11+4τ≤0 => 4τ≤11 => τ≤11/4=2.75, τ≤2\n\nSecond: 0≤4τ always for τ≥0\n\nSo for τ=0: -11≤0≤0, yes\n\nτ=1: low=-11+4=-7, high=4, 0 in [-7,4] yes\n\nτ=2: low=-11+8=-3, high=8, 0 in [-3,8] yes\n\nτ=3: low=-11+12=1, high=12, 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSo occupied for τ=0,1,2\n\nT=16,17,18\n\nSecond car: (-48, -59, right, 4)\n\nLow = τ + s τ = -59 +4τ\n\nHigh = h + s τ = -48 +4τ\n\n0 in span if -59+4τ ≤0 ≤ -48+4τ\n\nFirst: -59+4τ≤0 => 4τ≤59 => τ≤14.75, τ≤14\n\nSecond: 0≤ -48+4τ => 4τ≥48 => τ≥12\n\nSo τ=12,13,14\n\nAt τ=12: low=-59+48= -11, high=-48+48=0, 0 in [-11,0]\n\nτ=13: low=-59+52= -7, high=-48+52=4, 0 in [-7,4]\n\nτ=14: low=-59+56= -3, high=-48+56=8, 0 in [-3,8]\n\nτ=15: low=-59+60=1, high=-48+60=12, 0 not in\n\nSo for freeway 7, occupied at τ=0,1,2 (from car 1) and τ=12,13,14 (car 2), but τ=12,13,14 are later.\n\nFor early turns, occupied at τ=0,1,2.\n\nFreeway 8: (0, -11, right, 3)\n\nOnly one car? (0, -11, right, 3)\n\nRight-moving, low = τ + s τ = -11 +3τ\n\nHigh = h + s τ = 0 +3τ =3τ\n\n0 in span if -11+3τ ≤0 ≤3τ\n\nFirst: -11+3τ≤0 => 3τ≤11 => τ≤11/3≈3.666, τ≤3\n\nSecond: 0≤3τ always τ≥0\n\nSo τ=0: -11≤0≤0, yes\n\nτ=1: low=-11+3=-8, high=3, 0 in [-8,3] yes\n\nτ=2: low=-11+6=-5, high=6, 0 in [-5,6] yes\n\nτ=3: low=-11+9=-2, high=9, 0 in [-2,9] yes\n\nτ=4: low=-11+12=1, high=12, 0 not in\n\nSo occupied τ=0 to 3, T=16 to 19.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, the turns when x=0 is occupied (relative to t1=16).\n\nτ = T - 16\n\nFreeway 1: occupied only at τ=1 (T=17)\n\nFreeway 2: occupied at τ=0 (T=16) and τ=4 (T=20) from car 2, but τ=0 from car 1.\n\nAt τ=0, occupied; τ=4 occupied.\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2, occupied at τ=0 (T=16) and τ=4 (T=20)\n\nFreeway 4: occupied at τ=2 (T=18)\n\nFreeway 5: same as 4, occupied at τ=2 (T=18)\n\nFreeway 6: never occupied\n\nFreeway 7: occupied at τ=0,1,2 (T=16,17,18) and also at τ=12,13,14 but later, not relevant for now.\n\nFreeway 8: occupied at τ=0,1,2,3 (T=16,17,18,19)\n\nI start at y=5 at τ=0, turn T=16.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nThe minimal moves: from y=5 to y=9, need 4 up moves.\n\nBut I have to avoid being on a freeway when it is occupied.\n\nAt each turn, when I am on a freeway, it must not be occupied at that turn.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nI am at y=5 at τ=0.\n\nFirst, at turn τ=0 (T=16), I am on y=5. Is freeway 5 occupied at τ=0?\n\nFreeway 5: we have occupation at τ=2, but at τ=0?\n\nFrom above, freeway 5: only occupied at τ=2, not at τ=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6 never occupied.\n\nBut at τ=0, for freeway 5: cars? Freeway 5 has (48,83,left,36), at τ=0, span [48,83], which is positive, 0 not in, so not occupied. Similarly, no other cars, so freeway 5 is safe at τ=0.\n\nI am on y=5 at τ=0, and I choose action a_t for this turn.\n\nI want to go up, but let's see the path.\n\nI need to plan the sequence.\n\nSince min H is 4, I should check if I can go up directly in 4 turns.\n\nStart at y=5, τ=0.\n\nTurn τ=0 (T=16): at y=5, freeway 5 is safe (not occupied), so I can choose action.\n\nIf I choose U, then y_{τ=1} =6? Let's use relative time.\n\nSet t relative to t1, so turn k, where k=0,1,2,... with k=0 being current turn.\n\nAt turn k, position y_k.\n\nStart k=0, y_0=5.\n\nAfter action a_k, y_{k+1} = y_k + Δy_k.\n\nWe need to find min H such that y_{H-1} =9? The turn index.\n\nIn terms of k, the turns are k=0 to H-1, and at turn k=H-1, y_{H-1}=9.\n\nAnd for each turn k, when on freeway y_k, it must not be occupied at that turn.\n\nThe occupation is at absolute turn T, but since T=t1 + k, and t1=16, so at relative turn k, occupation same as at τ=k.\n\nFor freeway, at relative turn k, occupied if k in the set we have.\n\nFor freeway 1: occ at k=1\n\nFreeway 2: occ at k=0 and k=4\n\nFreeway 3: occ at k=0 and k=4\n\nFreeway 4: occ at k=2\n\nFreeway 5: occ at k=2\n\nFreeway 6: never occ\n\nFreeway 7: occ at k=0,1,2\n\nFreeway 8: occ at k=0,1,2,3\n\nNow, I start at k=0, y=5.\n\nFreeway 5 at k=0: not occupied (only at k=2), so safe.\n\nI can choose action.\n\nI want to go to y=9 quickly.\n\nSuppose I go up each time if possible.\n\nk=0: at y=5, safe, choose U, then y_{1} =6\n\nNow k=1: at y=6, freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6 never occupied, so safe. Choose U, y_{2}=7\n\nk=2: at y=7, freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 occupied at k=0,1,2.\n\nk=2, so occupied, if I am on it, collision.\n\nAt k=2, freeway 7 is occupied, so I cannot be on y=7 at turn k=2.\n\nBut I would be if I go up from y=6 to y=7 at k=2? Let's see.\n\nAt turn k=1, I was at y=6, I choose action for turn k=1.\n\nIf I choose U, then at turn k=1, I am on y=6, which is safe (freeway 6 never occ).\n\nThen after action, y_{k+1} = y_k + Δy, so after U at k=1, y_{2} =7.\n\nThen at turn k=2, I am on y=7.\n\nBut freeway 7 at k=2 is occupied, so collision at turn k=2.\n\nCannot do that.\n\nSo I need to avoid being on y=7 at k=2.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nNow, back to k=0.\n\nAt k=0, y=5, safe. I choose U, go to y=6 at k=1? After action, y_{k+1} is for next turn.\n\nAt turn k=0, I am at y_0=5, choose a_0, then y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0.\n\nThen at turn k=1, I am at y_1, and so on.\n\nSo in the sequence:\n\nk=0 (turn 16): at y=5, safe, choose a_0.\n\nIf a_0 = U, then y_1 =6\n\nk=1 (turn 17): at y=6, freeway 6, safe (never occ), choose a_1.\n\nIf a_1 = U, then y_2 =7\n\nk=2 (turn 18): at y=7, freeway 7 occupied at k=2? k=2 is relative, τ=2, T=18.\n\nFreeway 7 occ at τ=0,1,2, so at k=2, occ, collision.\n\nIf a_1 = S, then y_2 = y_1 =6, so at k=2, still on y=6, freeway 6 safe.\n\nThen at k=2, I can choose U to go to y=7.\n\nBut at k=2, if I go to y=7, at turn k=2 I am still on y=6 when I choose action.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nAt turn k=2, I am at y_2. If y_2=6, I am on freeway 6, which is safe.\n\nI choose a_2, if U, then y_3 =7.\n\nThen at turn k=3, I am at y_3=7.\n\nNow, what about freeway 7 at k=3? k=3, τ=3, T=19.\n\nFreeway 7: occ at k=0,1,2 and also k=12,13,14 but k=3 not occ? Earlier for freeway 7, occ at τ=0,1,2, and τ=12,13,14.\n\nAt τ=3, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 occ at k=0,1,2,3.\n\nAt k=3, freeway 8 occ, but freeway 7 at k=3 not occ.\n\nSo if at k=3, on y=7, freeway 7 not occ, safe.\n\nThen I can go up to y=8.\n\nBut let's sequence.\n\nBack to k=0: I am at y=5, choose U, so a_0=U, y_1=6\n\nk=1: at y=6, freeway 6 safe, now I need to choose action.\n\nIf I choose S, then a_1=S, y_2=6\n\nThen k=2: at y=6, safe, now choose a_2.\n\nIf U, a_2=U, y_3=7\n\nThen k=3: at y=7, freeway 7 at k=3 not occupied (since occ only k=0,1,2,12-14, k=3 ok), so safe.\n\nThen I can choose U, a_3=U, y_4=8\n\nk=4: at y=8, freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 occupied at k=0,1,2,3? k=4?\n\nFreeway 8 occ at τ=0,1,2,3, so k=0 to 3.\n\nk=4: τ=4, T=20.\n\nFreeway 8: only one car, (0,-11,right,3), occ at k=0,1,2,3 as above.\n\nAt k=4: low = -11 +3*4 = -11+12=1, high=3*4=12, 0 not in [1,12], so not occupied at k=4.\n\nSimilarly, k=3: low=-11+9= -2, high=9, 0 in.\n\nk=4 not occ.\n\nSo at k=4, freeway 8 not occupied.\n\nNow, back: at k=3, y=7, safe, choose U, y_4=8\n\nk=4: at y=8, freeway 8 not occ (k=4), safe.\n\nThen choose U, a_4=U, y_5=9\n\nk=5: at y=9, which is not a freeway, safe, and we are done? But we need to be at (0,9) at some turn, here at turn k=5, y_5=9.\n\nBut the turn when we reach y=9 is k=5.\n\nH is the number of turns from k=0 to k=H-1.\n\nWe start at k=0, actions at k=0 to H-1, and at turn k=H-1, y_{H-1}=9.\n\nIn this case, at k=5, y_5=9, so we need to have turn k=H-1=5, so H-1=5, H=6.\n\nBut we moved in 5 steps? Let's list the positions.\n\nk=0: y=5, action U, to y=6\n\nk=1: y=6, action S? In my earlier, I had a delay.\n\nk=0: action U, to y=6\n\nk=1: at y=6, I chose S or something.\n\nIn the path I thought: k=0: U to y=6\n\nk=1: at y=6, I need to avoid being on y=7 at k=2, so at k=1, I choose S, so y=6 still.\n\nThen k=2: at y=6, choose U, to y=7\n\nk=3: at y=7, choose U, to y=8\n\nk=4: at y=8, choose U, to y=9\n\nk=5: at y=9, but we need to be at y=9 at turn k=H-1.\n\nAt turn k=4, after action, y_5=9, but at turn k=4, I am still at y=8, not y=9.\n\nThe position at turn k is y_k.\n\nAfter actions, y_{k+1} is set.\n\nAt turn k, I am at y_k.\n\nAfter action a_k, I move to y_{k+1} for the next turn.\n\nWe need y_m =9 for some m, and m = H-1, the last turn in the sequence.\n\nIn this case, if I go to y=9 at turn k=5, then I need to include turn k=5 in the sequence, with y_5=9.\n\nActions from k=0 to k=4? Let's index.\n\nTurns: k=0,1,2,3,4: 5 turns, actions at k=0,1,2,3,4.\n\nAfter k=4 action, y_5 is set.\n\nIf y_5=9, then at turn k=5, I am at y_5=9.\n\nBut the sequence of actions is for k=0 to k=4, so H=5 actions? H is the number of actions, from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nIn terms of k, actions at k=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, we have y_H.\n\nBut we need y_{H-1} =9? I'm confused.\n\nLet's read the problem.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1 such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nSo at turn t1 + H -1, position y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAnd actions from t=0 to H-1 for the offset.\n\nSet t=0 at t1, so at turn t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAt turn t1 + t, position y_{t1 + t}.\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + t}, y_{t1 + t +1} = y_{t1 + t} + Δy_t.\n\nWe need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThat means at turn t1 + H -1, we are at position 9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, then at turn t1 + 1 -1 = t1, we need y_{t1} =9, but it is 5, impossible.\n\nMinimal H if no obstacles: from y=5 to y=9, need to increase by 4, so min H=5, with y_{t1+4} =9, so H-1=4, H=5.\n\nActions at t1 to t1+4, 5 actions, and at turn t1+4, y=9.\n\nSimilarly, in the delayed path, with H=6, y_{t1+5}=9.\n\nBut we want minimal H.\n\nFirst, can I reach in H=5?\n\nThat is, reach y=9 at turn t1+4 (since H-1=4).\n\nt1=16, so at turn 20, y=9.\n\nActions from turn 16 to 20? Turns: t=16,17,18,19,20? Actions at t=16 to t=20? t from 0 to H-1, H=5, t=0,1,2,3,4, so turns 16,17,18,19,20? t=0: turn 16, t=1:17, t=2:18, t=3:19, t=4:20.\n\nThen at turn t1 + H -1 =16+5-1=20, y_20=9.\n\nNow, positions: at turn 16: y=5\n\nAfter action a_16, y_17 = y_16 + Δy_16\n\nAt turn 17: y_17, and so on.\n\nWe need to set actions so that after 4 actions, y_20=9? y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{20} =9.\n\ny_{20} is the position at turn 20.\n\nIt must be reached by the actions.\n\nStart at turn 16: y_16=5\n\nAction a_16, then y_17 = y_16 + Δy_16\n\nSimilarly, a_17, y_18 = y_17 + Δy_17\n\na_18, y_19 = y_18 + Δy_18\n\na_19, y_20 = y_19 + Δy_19\n\nWe need y_20=9.\n\nSince y_16=5, the sum of Δy from t=16 to 19 must be +4.\n\nEach Δy is -1,0,+1.\n\nTo reach in min turns, we need as many U as possible, but with constraints.\n\nNow, for collision, at each turn T, we check based on y_T.\n\nTurn T=16 (k=0): y_16=5, freeway 5, not occupied (only at T=18, but T=16 not), so safe.\n\nTurn T=17 (k=1): y_17, depends on action.\n\nIf we go up, y_17=6, freeway 6, safe.\n\nTurn T=18 (k=2): y_18, if y_18=7, freeway 7 occupied at T=18 (since k=2), collision.\n\nIf y_18=6, freeway 6 safe.\n\nIf y_18=8, freeway 8 occupied at T=18? T=18 is k=2, τ=2, freeway 8 occ at k=0,1,2,3, so yes occupied.\n\nFreeway 8 occ at T=16,17,18,19.\n\nT=18 occ.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 occ at T=18.\n\nNow, for T=19 (k=3): freeway 7 not occ (since occ only T=16,17,18 for early), T=19 not occ.\n\nFreeway 8 occ at T=19.\n\nFreeway 6 safe always.\n\nFreeway 5 occ at T=18 only, but T=19 not.\n\nTo reach y_20=9, and y_16=5, so net +4 in 4 actions (from a_16 to a_19).\n\nActions affect y_17 to y_20.\n\ny_17 = y_16 + Δy_16\n\ny_18 = y_17 + Δy_17\n\ny_19 = y_18 + Δy_18\n\ny_20 = y_19 + Δy_19\n\ny_20 = y_16 + Δy_16 + Δy_17 + Δy_18 + Δy_19\n\nSet equal to 9, y_16=5, so Δy_16 to Δy_19 sum to +4.\n\nEach Δy <=1, so must all be U, but may not be possible due to collisions.\n\nIf all U, then:\n\nTurn 16: y=5, safe, action U, y_17=6\n\nTurn 17: y=6, safe (freeway6), action U, y_18=7\n\nBut at turn 18, y=7, freeway 7 occupied (T=18), collision. Not possible.\n\nSo cannot go directly up.\n\nNeed to stay or go down to avoid.\n\nMin H=5 may not be possible.\n\nTry to be at safe positions.\n\nAt T=18 (k=2), freeways 7 and 8 are occupied, also 4 and 5, but y=6 is safe.\n\ny=1,2,3,4 may have issues, but we are at higher y.\n\ny=6 is always safe.\n\ny=5 safe except at T=18.\n\ny=4 safe except at T=18? Freeway 4 occupied at T=18.\n\nFreeway 4 at T=18: k=2, occ.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5 at T=18 occ.\n\nFreeway 6 safe.\n\nFreeway 7 occ T=18.\n\nFreeway 8 occ T=18.\n\nSo at T=18, only freeway 6 is safe, y=6.\n\ny=0 or y=9 safe, but y=0 is bottom.\n\nSo at turn T=18, I must be on y=6 to avoid collision.\n\nSimilarly, at other turns.\n\nNow for T=17: freeway 7 occ, freeway 8 occ? T=17, k=1.\n\nFreeway 7 occ at k=1, yes.\n\nFreeway 8 occ at k=1, yes.\n\nFreeway 6 safe.\n\nFreeway 5: at k=1, not occ, only k=2.\n\nSo at T=17, I can be on y=5 or y=6, both safe? y=5 freeway 5 safe at T=17, y=6 safe.\n\ny=4: freeway 4 at T=17? k=1, τ=1, T=17.\n\nFreeway 4: occ only at k=2, not k=1, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: occ at k=0 and k=4, not k=1, so safe.\n\nBut we are around y=5-6.\n\nNow for T=19: k=3, T=19.\n\nFreeway 7: not occ (occ k=0,1,2,12-14, k=3 not)\n\nFreeway 8: occ at k=3, since τ=3.\n\nFreeway 6 safe.\n\nSo at T=19, y=7 safe, y=6 safe, y=8 not safe (freeway 8 occ).\n\ny=8 freeway 8 occ at T=19.\n\nNow back to plan.\n\nWe need y_20=9.\n\nTo minimize H, H=5.\n\nSo actions at T=16,17,18,19 to set y_20=9.\n\ny_20 = y_19 + Δy_19\n\nTo have y_20=9, since y_19 <=8, must have Δy_19 = U or possibly S if y_19=9, but y_19=9 only if we reach early, but we need y_20=9, so y_19 <=8, so Δy_19 must be U to reach 9, or D or S if y_19=9, but not.\n\ny_20 = y_19 + Δy_19, and y_20=9, y_19 between 0 and 9, so if y_19=8, Δy=U; y_19=9, Δy=S or D; but since we want to reach at turn 20, probably y_19=8, Δy=U to go to 9.\n\nIf y_19=9, then at turn 19 we are already at 9, but we need at turn 20 to be 9, so it could be, but then H would be smaller? For H=5, turn 20 is the target.\n\nIf we reach at turn 19, y_19=9, then for that, H-1=19? Turn t1+H-1=19, so H-1=3? t1=16, t1+H-1=19, so 16+H-1=19, H-1=3, H=4.\n\nBut min to increase by 4, H=4 would mean y_{16+4-1}=y_19=9, with actions from t=16 to t=18? H=4 actions at t=16,17,18.\n\nThen y_19=9.\n\nSimilarly, possible if we move faster.\n\nBut let's first try H=5.\n\nFor H=5, y_20=9.\n\nThus y_19 must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y_19=9, then at turn 19 we are at 9, but we need turn 20 to be 9, so we can stay, but turn 19 is before turn 20.\n\nAt turn 19, if y_19=9, it is already reached, but for H=5, we specify actions to turn 19 to set y_20=9, so y_19=8 or 9.\n\nBut if y_19=9, then to have y_20=9, we must choose S or D, but D would go down, not good.\n\nSo better to have y_19=8 and Δy_19=U.\n\nSimilarly, y_18 must be such that we can reach y_19=8.\n\nNow constraints.\n\nAt turn T=18 (k=2), we must be on y=6, as only safe freeway.\n\nBecause y=7 and 8 occupied, y=5 and 4 occupied? Freeway 4 at T=18 occ, freeway 5 occ, so y=4,5 not safe.\n\ny=6 safe.\n\ny=3? Freeway 3 at T=18: k=2, τ=2.\n\nFreeway 3 occ at k=0 and k=4, not k=2, so safe? But we are at y=5, going to 9, not necessary to go down.\n\nSimilarly, y=2,1 may be safe but lower.\n\nBut to minimize moves, we should not go down.\n\nSo at T=18, must be y=6.\n\nSo y_18 =6.\n\nNow, y_18=6.\n\nThen at turn T=18, we are on y=6, safe.\n\nNow, from here, we need to go to y=9 by turn 20.\n\ny_20=9.\n\ny_19 = y_18 + Δy_18 = 6 + Δy_18\n\nThen y_20 = y_19 + Δy_19\n\ny_20=9.\n\nNow, y_19 can be 6,7,8 depending on Δy_18.\n\nThen y_20 = y_19 + Δy_19 =9.\n\nIf y_19=6, then Δy_19= U, y_20=7, not 9, impossible to reach 9 in one step.\n\ny_19=7, y_20=8 with U, or 9? If Δy_19=U, y_20=8, not 9; to y_20=9, need y_19=8 and Δy_19=U.\n\ny_19=7, Δy_19=U, y_20=8<9.\n\ny_19=8, Δy_19=U, y_20=9.\n\ny_19=9, Δy_19=S or D, y_20=9 or 8, but y_20=9 only if S.\n\nBut we need to reach at turn 20, so y_19=8 and Δy_19=U is best.\n\nIf y_19=9, we reach at turn 19, but for H=5, turn 20 is target.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach earlier.\n\nFirst for H=5, with y_20=9.\n\nThus need y_19=8 and Δy_19=U.\n\ny_19=8.\n\nNow y_19 comes from y_18 and Δy_18.\n\ny_18=6, as we must be at T=18.\n\ny_18=6.\n\nThen y_19 = y_18 + Δy_18 = 6 + Δy_18\n\nWe need y_19=8, so 6 + Δy_18 =8, thus Δy_18 = +2? But Δy can only be -1,0,1, so impossible. y_19 <=7 if y_18=6.\n\ny_19 =6 or 7, cannot be 8.\n\nThus y_19 cannot be 8 if y_18=6.\n\nContradiction.\n\nTherefore, for H=5, to have y_20=9, we need y_19=8, but at T=18, y_18 must be 6, so y_19 <=7, cannot be 8.\n\nIf y_19=9, but y_19= y_18 + Δy_18 <=6+1=7<9, impossible.\n\ny_18=6, y_19 <=7, y_20 <=8, cannot reach 9 in two steps from y_18=6.\n\ny_20 = y_18 + Δy_18 + Δy_19 <=6 +1 +1=8<9, so indeed, from y_18=6, after two actions, y_20 <=8, cannot reach 9.\n\nThus for H=5, it is impossible to reach y_20=9 because at T=18 we are stuck at y=6 and can only reach y=8 by T=20.\n\ny_20 <= y_18 +2 =8.\n\nThus min H=5 impossible.\n\nNow, try H=6.\n\nH=6, then at turn t1 + H -1 =16+6-1=21, y_21=9.\n\nActions from t=16 to t=20, 6 actions? H=6 actions at t=16 to t=21? t from 0 to H-1=5, turns 16 to 20.\n\nActions at turn 16 to 20.\n\nThen y_{21} is after, but we need y_{21}? t1+H-1=16+6-1=21, y_21=9.\n\nSo at turn 21, position y=9.\n\nNow, from y_16=5 to y_21=9, net +4 in 5 steps, so possible with stays or down, but we want min H, so avoid down.\n\nNow constraints.\n\nAt T=18, must be y=6, as before.\n\nT=18 is turn 18, which is relative k=2 (since T=16+k, k=2 for T=18).\n\nIn H=6, turns from T=16 to T=21.\n\nRelative k=0 to 5.\n\nT=16: k=0\n\nT=17: k=1\n\nT=18: k=2\n\nT=19: k=3\n\nT=20: k=4\n\nT=21: k=5\n\nAt k=2 (T=18), must be on y=6 to be safe.\n\nNow, at other times, need to avoid occupied freeways.\n\nWe need to reach y_21=9.\n\ny_21 = y_20 + Δy_20\n\nSet y_20=8 or 9, but y_20=8, Δy_20=U to y_21=9.\n\nNow, at T=20 (k=4), what is safe?\n\nFreeway at T=20.\n\nk=4, τ=4.\n\nFreeway 1: occ only k=1, not k=4\n\nFreeway 2: occ at k=4 (since car2 at τ=4)\n\nFreeway 2 occ at k=4, T=20.\n\nFreeway 3 occ at k=4.\n\nFreeway 4: occ only k=2, not k=4\n\nFreeway 5: occ only k=2, not k=4\n\nFreeway 6: never\n\nFreeway 7: occ at k=12,13,14, not k=4\n\nFreeway 8: occ at k=0,1,2,3, not k=4 (as earlier, k=4 low=1>0)\n\nSo at T=20, freeways 2 and 3 occupied, others safe.\n\ny=2 and y=3 occupied at T=20.\n\ny=1,4,5,6,7,8 safe? y=1 freeway 1 not occ, y=4 freeway4 not occ, etc.\n\ny=2 and y=3 occupied, so avoid.\n\nSimilarly, at T=19 (k=3): freeway 7 not occ, freeway 8 occ (k=3), so y=8 occupied.\n\ny=7 safe, y=6 safe, etc.\n\nNow back to path.\n\nWe need to be at y=6 at T=18.\n\ny_18=6.\n\nNow from here, go to y=9 by T=21.\n\nPossible in 3 steps: e.g., U,U,U from y=6 to 7,8,9.\n\nBut check collisions.\n\nAt T=19 (k=3): if we are on y=7, freeway 7 not occupied at k=3, safe.\n\nIf on y=8, freeway 8 occupied at k=3, not safe.\n\nSo at T=19, we must not be on y=8.\n\nSimilarly, at T=20, if on y=8, freeway 8 not occupied at k=4, safe.\n\nk=4, T=20, freeway 8 not occ, as above.\n\nNow, sequence.\n\nStart at T=16 (k=0): y=5, freeway 5 safe (not occ), so we can choose action.\n\nWe need to reach y=6 at T=18.\n\ny_18=6.\n\nNow from T=16 to T=18.\n\ny_16=5\n\ny_17 = y_16 + Δy_16\n\ny_18 = y_17 + Δy_17\n\nWe need y_18=6.\n\nAlso, at each turn, safe.\n\nT=16: y=5, safe, choose a_16.\n\nIf U, then y_17=6\n\nThen T=17: y=6, freeway 6 safe, now we need y_18=6, so at T=17, choose S, a_17=S, then y_18=6\n\nThen T=18: y=6, safe.\n\nIf at T=16, we choose S, a_16=S, y_17=5\n\nThen T=17: y=5, freeway 5 at T=17: k=1, not occ (only k=2), so safe.\n\nThen to have y_18=6, choose U, a_17=U, y_18=6\n\nThen T=18: y=6, safe.\n\nBoth possible.\n\nNow, from T=18, y=6, we go up.\n\nT=18: at y=6, choose action a_18.\n\nIf U, then y_19=7\n\nT=19: y=7, freeway 7 at T=19 (k=3), not occupied, safe.\n\nThen choose a_19, if U, y_20=8\n\nT=20: y=8, freeway 8 at T=20 (k=4), not occupied, safe.\n\nThen choose a_20=U, y_21=9\n\nT=21: y=9, safe, done.\n\nWe need y_21=9.\n\nIn this case, actions: let's list.\n\nT=16: action, say U or S.\n\nFirst, with U at T=16:\n\n- T=16: a=U, y_17=6\n\n- T=17: a=S, y_18=6 (since need to be at y=6 for T=18)\n\n- T=18: a=U, y_19=7\n\n- T=19: a=U, y_20=8\n\n- T=20: a=U, y_21=9\n\nAt T=21, y=9.\n\nActions from T=16 to T=20, 5 actions? Turns: actions at T=16,17,18,19,20 for H=6? H actions from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nt1=16, t1+H-1=21, so H-1=5, H=6.\n\nActions at turns 16,17,18,19,20.\n\n5 actions? H=6, actions at t=0 to 5, turns 16 to 20? t=0:16, t=1:17, t=2:18, t=3:19, t=4:20? That's 5 actions.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, H=6, t=0,1,2,3,4,5? t=0,1,2,3,4,5 is 6 values.\n\nTurns: t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for H=6, t=0 to 5, turns 16,17,18,19,20,21? t=0: turn 16, action a_16\n\nt=1: turn 17, a_17\n\nt=2: turn 18, a_18\n\nt=3: turn 19, a_19\n\nt=4: turn 20, a_20\n\nt=5: turn 21, a_21? But we need y at turn t1+H-1=21, so after a_20, y_21 is set, and at turn 21, we are at y_21.\n\nBut if we set a_21, it would affect y_22, but we don't need.\n\nIn the sequence, actions up to a_{t1+H-1}, which for turn t1+H-1.\n\nIn this case, for H=6, actions at turns 16 to 21? t1 to t1+H-1=16 to 21, that's 6 turns.\n\nAction at each turn from 16 to 21.\n\nBut at turn 21, if we are at y=9, we may not need action, but we have to specify the action for that turn to stay or something.\n\nThe sequence includes the action for turn t1+H-1 if we are not yet at goal, but when we reach, we can choose S.\n\nIn this path:\n\nAt turn 16: y=5, a=U, y_17=6\n\nTurn 17: y=6, a=S, y_18=6\n\nTurn 18: y=6, a=U, y_19=7\n\nTurn 19: y=7, a=U, y_20=8\n\nTurn 20: y=8, a=U, y_21=9\n\nNow at turn 21: y=9, but we need an action for turn 21? For H=6, actions up to turn 21.\n\nAt turn 21, we are at y=9, we can choose a=S to stay, or whatever, but since we reached, it's fine.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to specify action for turn 21.\n\nBut y_21=9, so we can choose S.\n\nNow, in the above, we have 6 actions: turns 16 to 21.\n\nBut at turn 21, we are at y=9, which is the goal for that turn.\n\nWe could have reached earlier.\n\nWith the S at turn 17.\n\nBut we could avoid that stay.\n\nEarlier with S at T=16.\n\nAlternative: at T=16, choose S, a=S, y_17=5\n\nThen T=17: y=5, safe, choose U, a=U, y_18=6\n\nT=18: y=6, safe, then same as before.\n\nStill, we need actions to go up.\n\nBut in this case, from T=18, y=6, we go U to T=19 y=7, U to T=20 y=8, U to T=21 y=9.\n\nSame as before.\n\nCan we reach before T=21?\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=9 at T=20 or earlier.\n\nBut at T=20, if y_20=9, then for that, we need turn t1+H-1=20, so H-1=4, H=5, but we saw impossible because at T=18 stuck at y=6.\n\nIf we can be at higher position earlier.\n\nBut at T=18, must be y=6, so cannot be higher.\n\nAt T=19, we can be at y=7, as above.\n\nThen at T=20, y=8, T=21 y=9.\n\nBut at T=20, y=8, is it possible to go directly to y=9? Yes, but y_21=9.\n\nTo reach at T=20, y_20=9.\n\nBut at T=18, y_18=6, then y_19 = y_18 + Δy_18 <=7, y_20 <=8, cannot be 9.\n\nIf we are at y=7 at T=19, y_20 <=8.\n\nStill not 9.\n\nSo earliest to reach is T=21 with y=9.\n\nH=6.\n\nNow, in the path, we have a stay or not necessary.\n\nBut we can go directly if possible.\n\nAnother way: from start, go up to y=6, but at T=17, if we are at y=6, we can stay, but we could go to y=7 at T=18? But T=18 y=7 occupied, cannot.\n\nAt T=17, if we go down to y=5, but y=5 at T=17 is safe, but then to y=6 at T=18.\n\nSame as before.\n\nPerhaps go to y=4 or something, but that might take longer.\n\nSo minimal H is 6.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we can choose.\n\nFor example, with no down, only up and stay.\n\nIn the first path: actions\n\nTurn 16: U to y=6\n\nBut at turn 16, after U, y_17=6.\n\nThen turn 17: if we do nothing, but we need to be at y=6 for turn 18, so at turn 17, we choose S, so y_18=6.\n\nThen turn 18: U to y=7\n\nTurn 19: U to y=8\n\nTurn 20: U to y=9\n\nThen at turn 20, y=9? y_20=8, after U, y_21=9.\n\nAt turn 20, we are at y=8, choose U, go to y=9 at next turn.\n\nBut for turn 21, we need to be at y=9, so action at turn 20: U.\n\nThen turn 21: at y=9, we choose, say, S.\n\nBut in the sequence, for H=6, actions at turn 16 to 21.\n\nTo write:\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: S  (to stay at 6 for turn 18)\n\nBut at turn 17, position y=6, we choose S, so remain at 6.\n\nThen turn 18: U to 7\n\nTurn 19: U to 8\n\nTurn 20: U to 9  (y_21=9)\n\nThen turn 21: at y=9, choose S to stay.\n\nBut since we reached at turn 21, and action at turn 21 is needed, we can choose S.\n\nWithout the stay at turn 17.\n\nAt turn 16: choose S, a=S, y_17=5\n\nTurn 17: at y=5, choose U, a=U, y_18=6\n\nTurn 18: at y=6, choose U, a=U, y_19=7\n\nTurn 19: at y=7, choose U, a=U, y_20=8\n\nTurn 20: at y=8, choose U, a=U, y_21=9\n\nTurn 21: at y=9, choose S, a=S\n\nIn this sequence, at turn 18, we are at y=6, safe.\n\nAt turn 19, y=7, safe (freeway 7 not occ at T=19)\n\nTurn 20, y=8, safe (freeway 8 not occ at T=20)\n\nTurn 21, y=9, safe.\n\nAnd no collision.\n\nH=6.\n\nIs there a way with H=5? We thought no, but confirm.\n\nSuppose we go up at turn 16 to y=6.\n\nThen at turn 17, if we go up to y=7, but at turn 18, if y=7, occupied, cannot.\n\nIf at turn 17, we go down to y=5, then at turn 18, to y=6, then turn 19 to y=7, turn 20 to y=8, but y_20=8, not 9. To reach y=9 at turn 20, need y_20=9, but from turn 18 y=6, after two actions, y_20 <=8.\n\nIf we start by going down or something, but y decreases, takes longer.\n\nSo H=6 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we can use the second one without extra stay.\n\nIn the second sequence: actions\n\nTurn 16: S (stay at 5)\n\nBut at turn 16, if S, we stay at y=5, which is safe.\n\nThen turn 17: U to y=6\n\nTurn 18: U to y=7? But at turn 18, if we go to y=7, at turn 18 position y=6, choose U, y_19=7.\n\nBut at turn 18, we are on y=6, not 7.\n\nThen turn 19: at y=7, choose U, y_20=8\n\nBut we need to reach at turn 21? For H=6.\n\nIn this: turn 18: U to y=7, so at turn 19 y=7\n\nThen turn 19: U to y=8, turn 20: U to y=9, then turn 21: S or something.\n\nTo reach at turn 21.\n\nBut in the sequence above with S at 16: \n\nTurn 16: S, y_17=5\n\nTurn 17: U, y_18=6\n\nTurn 18: U, y_19=7\n\nTurn 19: U, y_20=8\n\nTurn 20: U, y_21=9\n\nTurn 21: S (to stay at 9)\n\nBut turn 21 action is needed, but y_21=9 already, so S is fine.\n\nWe can avoid the initial S.\n\nIn the first way: turn 16: U, y_17=6\n\nTurn 17: S, y_18=6\n\nTurn 18: U, y_19=7\n\nTurn 19: U, y_20=8\n\nTurn 20: U, y_21=9\n\nTurn 21: S\n\nHere, we have an extra S at turn 17.\n\nBut H is same.\n\nTo minimize the number of actions, but H is fixed at 6.\n\nThe sequence should be minimal turns, which is 6.\n\nIn the second sequence, we have one less action? No, both have 6 actions.\n\nIn terms of moves, both have 4 U and one S or something.\n\nBut not important.\n\nNow, another thing: at turn 19, y=7, we go to y=8 at turn 20.\n\nBut at turn 19, freeway 7 is safe, freeway 8 at turn 19 is occupied, but we are not on it until next turn.\n\nAt turn 19, on y=7, safe.\n\nThen after U, to y=8 at turn 20.\n\nTurn 20, on y=8, freeway 8 at T=20 not occupied, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the sequence, we can choose either.\n\nBut in the second sequence, we don't have a stay, except at the end.\n\nTurn 16: S (but S is an action, we stay, but it delays.\n\nIn the sequence without initial S, we go up immediately but stay later.\n\nBut both work.\n\nI think the one with turn 16: U, turn 17: S, etc. has a redundant stay.\n\nBetter to use turn 16: S, then U,U,U,U to go up.\n\nBut from y=5, after S, still y=5, then U to 6, U to 7, etc.\n\nBut at turn 18, we go to y=7? In the sequence: after turn 16 S, y_17=5\n\nTurn 17 U, y_18=6\n\nTurn 18 U, y_19=7\n\nBut at turn 18, we are at y=6, choose U, to y=7 at turn 19.\n\nThen turn 19 U to y=8, turn 20 U to y=9.\n\nBut y_20=9? Then at turn 20, we are at y=9, but for H=6, we need turn 21 y=9? Contradiction.\n\nIn H=6, we need y_21=9.\n\nIf we set turn 20 U, y_21=9.\n\nBut in the sequence, with actions starting turn 16.\n\nIf we do: turn 16 S, y_17=5\n\nTurn 17 U, y_18=6\n\nTurn 18 U, y_19=7\n\nTurn 19 U, y_20=8\n\nTurn 20 U, y_21=9\n\nThen turn 21: S or U, but y=9, so S.\n\nAt turn 20, we choose U, to go to y=9 at turn 21.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 20 action U affects y_21.\n\nThen at turn 21, we are at y=9.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn this, we have one S at turn 16 and one at turn 21, but turn 21 S is after reaching.\n\nThe actions are for the turns.\n\nTo have fewer S, we can do:\n\nTurn 16: U to y=6\n\nThen turn 17: since we need to be at y=6 for turn 18, but at turn 17, if we choose S, we stay at 6.\n\nIf we choose D, go down, but worse.\n\nSo must choose S at turn 17 or earlier.\n\nThus the sequence must have a stay or equivalent.\n\nMinimal actions: we need to go from 5 to 9, 4 up moves, but with constraints, we need at least one extra turn to avoid the occupied turn, so H=6 with 4U and one S or two S, but in any case, 6 turns.\n\nIn the sequence with turn 16 S, we have 4U and 2S? Turn 16 S, turn 17 U, turn 18 U, turn 19 U, turn 20 U, turn 21 S: so U at 17,18,19,20 and S at 16 and 21.\n\nBut S at 21 is not necessary, we can just have action for the turns until we reach.\n\nBut since we need to specify for H turns, it includes.\n\nIn the other sequence: turn 16 U, turn 17 S, turn 18 U, turn 19 U, turn 20 U, turn 21 S: same, 4U and 2S.\n\nThe S at turn 21 can be avoided if we reach earlier, but we reach at turn 21.\n\nIn the sequence without initial S: turn 16 U (to6), turn 17 S (stay6), turn 18 U (to7), turn 19 U (to8), turn 20 U (to9), then at turn 20, after U, y_21=9, so at turn 21, y=9, we choose S.\n\nBut we could, at turn 20, if we are at y=8, we choose U to go to 9 at turn 21.\n\nBut we need to specify action for turn 21.\n\nSince we are at y=9 at turn 21, we choose S.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut let's confirm the car states, especially freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6 has only one car that never hits x=0, so always safe.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nIn the sequence, we can choose.\n\nTo have no down, and as direct as possible.\n\nI think turn 16: S is a waste, so better to go up first.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 16: U  (to y=6 at turn 17)\n\nBut at turn 16, action U, position after: y=6 at turn 17.\n\nThen turn 17: S  (stay at y=6 for turn 18)\n\nThen turn 18: U  (to y=7 at turn 19)\n\nTurn 19: U  (to y=8 at turn 20)\n\nTurn 20: U  (to y=9 at turn 21)\n\nThen turn 21: S  (stay at y=9)\n\nBut at turn 21, we are at y=9, and we choose S.\n\nSince we reach at turn 21, and action is for that turn.\n\nNow, in the output, it should be from turn t1=16.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: S\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: S\n\nBut H=6 turns.\n\nIs there a way to reach at turn 20? But we need to be at y=9 at turn 20.\n\nIf y_20=9.\n\nThen from turn 16, with 4 actions: turn 16,17,18,19 actions.\n\ny_20 = y_16 + Δy_16 + Δy_17 + Δy_18 + Δy_19 =5 + sum =9, so sum Δy =4, so all U.\n\nBut then y_17=6, y_18=7, but at turn 18, y=7 occupied, collision.\n\nCannot.\n\nIf we go down at some point, but then sum may not be +4, or take more turns.\n\nFor example, turn 16: U to6, turn 17: D to5 (but y=5 at turn 18? At turn 17, if D, y_18=5? Then at turn 18, y=5, but freeway 5 occupied, collision.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo impossible for H=5.\n\nThus H=6 is minimal.\n\nNow for the sequence, I think the above is fine.\n\nTo avoid the S at turn 17, but we need to be at y=6 at turn 18, so if we go up at turn 16 to6, then at turn 17 we must stay to be at y=6 for turn 18.\n\nIf we don't go up at turn 16, we stay or down, but down is worse.\n\nSo must have a stay at turn 17 or turn 16.\n\nIn terms of the path, it's symmetric.\n\nI think the sequence with turn 16 U, turn 17 S, etc. is acceptable.\n\nNow, write the answer.\n\nBut the player position is vertical axis y=0 to9, and freeways y=1 to8.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 21, we are at y=9, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, output format.\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 16: U Turn 17: S Turn 18: U Turn 19: U Turn 20: U Turn 21: S }\n\nBut H=6, and actions for 6 turns.\n\nTo save space, but I think it's fine.\n\nSince we reach at turn 21, and action S is chosen, but it could be omitted, but the sequence must be for H turns.\n\nAnother sequence: suppose at turn 16, we go to y=6.\n\nThen at turn 17, instead of S, we could go to y=7? But at turn 18, if y=7, occupied, cannot.\n\nOr go to y=5, but then at turn 18, to y=6, but y=5 at turn 17 is safe, but then turn 17: D? Worse.\n\nNo.\n\nSo must stay at turn 17 if at y=6.\n\nThus the sequence is as above.\n\nI think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 5)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 16\\) is 6, considering the need to avoid collisions with cars on the freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Collision Avoidance Reasoning:\n- At turn \\(T = 18\\) (relative turn \\(k = 2\\)), the only safe freeway is \\(y = 6\\) because:\n  - Freeway 1 is occupied at \\(T = 17\\) only.\n  - Freeways 2 and 3 are occupied at \\(T = 16\\) and \\(T = 20\\).\n  - Freeways 4 and 5 are occupied at \\(T = 18\\).\n  - Freeway 7 is occupied at \\(T = 16, 17, 18\\).\n  - Freeway 8 is occupied at \\(T = 16, 17, 18, 19\\).\n  - Freeway 6 is never occupied at \\(x = 0\\).\n- Thus, the player must be at \\(y = 6\\) at turn \\(T = 18\\) to avoid collision.\n- Starting from \\(y = 5\\) at \\(T = 16\\), reaching \\(y = 9\\) by \\(T = 21\\) (turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 16 + 6 - 1 = 21\\)) requires a sequence that includes staying at \\(y = 6\\) during turn 17 to ensure being at \\(y = 6\\) for turn 18, followed by moving up to \\(y = 7\\), \\(y = 8\\), and finally \\(y = 9\\).\n\n### Sequence of Actions:\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{t}\\}_{t=16}^{21}\\) that achieves this in \\(H = 6\\) turns is:\n- **Turn 16 (current turn, \\(y = 5\\))**: Action \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 6\\) for turn 17). Freeway 5 is safe at \\(T = 16\\) (not occupied).\n- **Turn 17 (\\(y = 6\\))**: Action \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 6\\) for turn 18). Freeway 6 is safe (never occupied).\n- **Turn 18 (\\(y = 6\\))**: Action \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 7\\) for turn 19). Freeway 6 is safe.\n- **Turn 19 (\\(y = 7\\))**: Action \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 8\\) for turn 20). Freeway 7 is safe at \\(T = 19\\) (not occupied).\n- **Turn 20 (\\(y = 8\\))**: Action \\(U\\) (move up to \\(y = 9\\) for turn 21). Freeway 8 is safe at \\(T = 20\\) (not occupied).\n- **Turn 21 (\\(y = 9\\))**: Action \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 9\\), as the goal is reached). Position \\((0, 9)\\) is safe (no freeway).\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 21 (i.e., \\(y_{21} = 9\\)) with no collisions, using 4 up actions (\\(U\\)) and 2 stay actions (\\(S\\)).\n\n### Why \\(H = 5\\) is Impossible:\n- To reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 20 (\\(H = 5\\), turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 16 + 5 - 1 = 20\\)), the player must be at \\(y = 6\\) at turn 18 to avoid collision.\n- From \\(y = 6\\) at turn 18, after two actions (turns 18 and 19), the maximum \\(y\\) achievable is 8 (e.g., \\(U\\) at turn 18 to \\(y = 7\\), \\(U\\) at turn 19 to \\(y = 8\\)). Thus, \\(y_{20} \\leq 8\\), and \\(y = 9\\) cannot be reached by turn 20. Down moves or stays would not help and may increase \\(H\\).\n\nThus, \\(H = 6\\) is minimal.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 21: S }",

The direction determines if they're moving left or right, and speed is how much they move per turn.\n\nCollision happens if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 (the x-coordinate where the player is) is within the car's span at that turn.\n\nThe span changes over time. For left-moving cars, the span moves left by speed each turn, so at turn T, span is [h - s*(T - t_1), τ - s*(T - t_1)] for left-moving, but looking back at the rule:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t_1), τ - s*(T-t_1)]\n\nBut in the notation, for left-moving, h is head, τ is tail, and since it's moving left, head and tail decrease. Similarly for right-moving, it increases.\n\nAlso, in the car state table, for each freeway, it lists cars with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nI need to find for each freeway and each car, when the car would be covering x=0 at turn T, so that if the player is on that freeway at that turn, it's a collision.\n\nBut the player moves vertically, so for each turn, the player is on a specific y-level, and we check if at that turn, for that y-level, there is a car with 0 in its span.\n\nThe key point is that collision is checked only when the player is on the freeway at that exact turn. Also, note that if the player moves to a different y at turn T, they are not on the new y until the next state, so at turn T, they are still on the previous y for collision purposes.\n\nFrom the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo at turn T, after action a_T, y_{T+1} is set, but for collision at turn T, it's based on y_T, the position before the action? Let's read carefully.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nAnd collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\n\ny_T is the position at turn T, I think. Let's see the notation.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nWhen we say \"turn T\", y_T is the position at that turn.\n\nFor example, at turn T, position is (0, y_T), and we check if for freeway y_T, there is a car with 0 in its span at time T.\n\nThe action a_T is taken at turn T, which sets y_{T+1}, but y_T is the current position when action is taken? I need to clarify the timing.\n\nFrom the dynamics: at turn t, the player is at position (0, y_t). Then they choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen, for collision at turn t: it says \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\".\n\ny_T is the position at turn T, so when we are at turn T, we are at y_T, and we check the cars on that freeway at time T.\n\nAfter choosing a_t, we move to y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nBut for collision, at turn T, we are on y_T, and we check cars on y_T at time T.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you don't check cars on y_{T+1} at turn T, only on y_T at turn T.\n\nSimilarly, at turn T, you are on y_T, so you check cars on y_T at time T.\n\nNow, the car spans are defined for each turn T, based on the initial state at t_1=17.\n\nSo, for any turn T >= t_1, we can compute the span for each car.\n\nLet t_1 = 17.\n\nFor a car, at turn T, the span is:\n\nIf direction is right: Span(T) = [τ + s*(T - t_1), h + s*(T - t_1)] because it moves right, so positions increase.\n\nIn the rule: for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t_1), τ - s*(T-t_1)]\n\nAnd collision if 0 is in [low, high] for some car on the current freeway y_T.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=6 at turn 17.\n\nWe need to reach y=9, so we need to increase y by 3, from 6 to 7,8,9.\n\nSince we can only change y by -1,0,+1 per turn, the minimum turns to go from 6 to 9 is 3 turns, if we go up each time: U,U,U.\n\nBut we have to avoid collisions, so we might need to wait or go down sometimes if necessary, but since we need to go up, going down might not help, but we can stay to avoid a collision.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and it's above, so we should go up, but we need to see if the path is clear.\n\nThe freeways are from y=1 to y=8, and we start at y=6, need to go to y=9. y=9 is not a freeway, it's the top, I think, since vertical axis y=0 to 9, and freeways are y=1 to 8 for cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there, so when we are at y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nBut we start at y=6, which is a freeway, and need to reach (0,9), which is safe.\n\nSo to reach y=9 from y=6, we need to be at y=8, then move up to y=9, or something.\n\nFrom y=8, if we go up, we go to y=9.\n\nSimilarly, from y=7 to y=8, etc.\n\nBut at each step, when we are on a freeway y=1 to 8, we need to avoid the cars at that position and time.\n\nFirst, I need to find for each freeway and each car, when it covers x=0.\n\nSince the player moves vertically, for each possible y and time, I need to know if it's safe to be there.\n\nBut time is from t=17 onwards.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t=0 relative to t_1, to simplify. Set τ = T - t_1, so τ=0 at turn 17.\n\nThen for a car, at time τ (after t_1), the span is:\n\nFor right-moving: [τ + s*τ, h + s*τ] where τ and h are at τ=0.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I have the cars.\n\nList all cars per freeway.\n\nFreeway k=1: only one car: (head, tail, dir, speed) = (0, -47, right, 48)\n\nSince direction right, and span at τ=0: [τ, h] = [-47, 0] because head=0, tail=-47? Let's see the notation.\n\nIn the table, it says for k=1: (0, -47, right, 48)\n\nAnd for right-moving, span is [τ, h] at τ=0, so τ = -47, h = 0, so [ -47, 0 ]\n\nAt time τ, span = [ τ + s*τ, h + s*τ ] = [ -47 + 48*τ, 0 + 48*τ ]\n\nCollision if 0 is in this interval, so -47 + 48τ <= 0 <= 48τ\n\nSo 0 <= 48τ and -47 + 48τ <= 0\n\nFrom 0 <= 48τ, τ >= 0\n\nFrom -47 + 48τ <= 0, 48τ <= 47, τ <= 47/48\n\nSince τ integer, τ <= 0 because 47/48 < 1, so τ=0\n\nAt τ=0, 0 <= 48*0 =0, and -47 +0 = -47 <=0, so yes, 0 is in [-47,0]\n\nFor τ=0, it is included.\n\nτ = T - t_1, at T=t_1, τ=0.\n\nSo at τ=0, for freeway 1, car has span [-47,0], and 0 is included, so if player is on y=1 at τ=0, collision.\n\nBut we start at y=6, not y=1, so at turn 17, we are at y=6, not y=1, so no collision for us at τ=0 on y=1.\n\nNow for other times.\n\nτ <= 47/48, so only at τ=0, 0 is covered? τ=0 is one point.\n\nSince τ integer, only τ=0 satisfies, because for τ=1, span [ -47+48, 0+48] = [1,48], 0 not in [1,48]\n\nFor τ=-1, but τ>=0, since time starts at t_1, so only at τ=0, on freeway 1, x=0 is covered.\n\nBut since we are not there at τ=0, it's ok.\n\nNow freeway 2: two cars\n\nFirst car: (12, 1, right, 12)\n\nRight-moving, so at τ=0, span [τ, h] = [1,12]? head=12, tail=1, so [1,12]\n\nAt time τ, span [1 + 12*τ, 12 + 12*τ]\n\nCollision if 0 in [1+12τ, 12+12τ]\n\nBut 1+12τ >=1 >0 for τ>=0, so 0 never in this interval. So this car never covers x=0.\n\nSecond car on freeway 2: (-36, -47, right, 12)\n\nHead=-36? tail=-47? Let's see: (-36, -47, right, 12)\n\nFor right-moving, span at τ=0: [τ, h] = [-47, -36]\n\nAt time τ: [ -47 + 12*τ, -36 + 12*τ ]\n\nCollision if 0 in [ -47+12τ, -36+12τ ]\n\nSo -47+12τ <= 0 <= -36+12τ\n\nFirst, 0 <= -36+12τ => 12τ >=36 => τ >=3\n\nSecond, -47+12τ <=0 => 12τ <=47 => τ <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916, so τ <=3 since integer.\n\nτ >=3 and τ <=3, so τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, span [ -47+36, -36+36] = [-11, 0], and 0 is included, so yes, at τ=3, x=0 covered.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? Cars: (12,1,right,12) and (-36,-47,right,12)\n\nIdentical to freeway 2.\n\nSo first car: never covers x=0.\n\nSecond car: covers x=0 at τ=3.\n\nNow freeway 4: (12,47,left,36)\n\nLeft-moving, so at τ=0, span [h, τ] = [12,47]? Head=12, tail=47? For left-moving, span is [h, τ], with h=12, τ=47? But usually head is the front, so if moving left, head is smaller or larger?\n\nIn the rule: for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ] and it moves left.\n\nIn the car state, for k=4: (12,47,left,36)\n\nSo head=12, tail=47, direction left.\n\nSince moving left, the head should be on the left, so smaller x, tail larger? But here head=12, tail=47, which is increasing, but moving left, so as time goes, both decrease.\n\nAt τ=0, span [h, τ] = [12,47]\n\nAt time τ, span [h - s*τ, τ - s*τ] = [12 - 36*τ, 47 - 36*τ]\n\nCollision if 0 in [12-36τ, 47-36τ]\n\nSo 12-36τ <= 0 <= 47-36τ\n\nFirst, 0 <= 47-36τ => 36τ <=47 => τ <= 47/36 ≈ 1.305, so τ <=1\n\nSecond, 12-36τ <=0 => 36τ >=12 => τ >= 12/36 = 1/3 ≈0.333, so τ >=1 since integer.\n\nThus τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1, span [12-36, 47-36] = [-24, 11], 0 is in [-24,11], yes.\n\nFor τ=0, [12,47], 0 not in, τ=2, [12-72,47-72]=[-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSo only τ=1.\n\nNow freeway 5: same as freeway 4? (12,47,left,36) identical, so same, covers x=0 at τ=1.\n\nFreeway 6: (54,43,right,6)\n\nRight-moving, head=54, tail=43? But for right-moving, span should be [τ, h], so if tail=43, head=54, so [43,54] at τ=0.\n\nAt time τ: [43 + 6τ, 54 + 6τ]\n\nSince 43+6τ >=43>0, never covers x=0. So always safe for this car.\n\nFreeway 7: two cars\n\nFirst car: (4, -7, right, 4)\n\nRight-moving, head=4, tail=-7? So span at τ=0: [τ, h] = [-7, 4]\n\nAt time τ: [-7 + 4τ, 4 + 4τ]\n\nCollision if 0 in [-7+4τ, 4+4τ]\n\n-7+4τ <=0 <=4+4τ\n\nLeft: -7+4τ <=0 => 4τ <=7 => τ <=7/4=1.75, so τ<=1\n\nRight: 0 <=4+4τ always true for τ>=0\n\nSo need -7+4τ <=0, which is τ<=1.75, so τ=0,1\n\nAt τ=0, [-7,4], 0 in it\n\nAt τ=1, [-7+4,4+4]=[-3,8], 0 in it\n\nAt τ=2, [-7+8,4+8]=[1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo covers x=0 at τ=0 and τ=1.\n\nSecond car on freeway 7: (-44, -55, right, 4)\n\nHead=-44, tail=-55? Right-moving, span at τ=0: [τ, h] = [-55, -44]\n\nAt time τ: [-55 +4τ, -44 +4τ]\n\nCollision if 0 in [-55+4τ, -44+4τ]\n\n-55+4τ <=0 <= -44+4τ\n\nFirst, 0 <= -44+4τ => 4τ >=44 => τ >=11\n\nSecond, -55+4τ <=0 => 4τ <=55 => τ <=55/4=13.75, so τ<=13\n\nThus τ from 11 to 13 inclusive.\n\nAt τ=11, [-55+44, -44+44]=[-11,0], 0 in\n\nτ=12, [-55+48, -44+48]=[-7,4], 0 in\n\nτ=13, [-55+52, -44+52]=[-3,8], 0 in\n\nτ=14, [-55+56, -44+56]=[1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo covers at τ=11,12,13.\n\nNow freeway 8: (3, -8, right, 3)\n\nRight-moving, head=3, tail=-8, span at τ=0: [τ, h] = [-8, 3]\n\nAt time τ: [-8 + 3τ, 3 + 3τ]\n\nCollision if 0 in [-8+3τ, 3+3τ]\n\n-8+3τ <=0 <=3+3τ\n\nLeft: -8+3τ <=0 => 3τ <=8 => τ <= 8/3 ≈2.666, so τ<=2\n\nRight: 0 <=3+3τ always true\n\nSo need τ<=2, so τ=0,1,2\n\nAt τ=0, [-8,3], 0 in\n\nτ=1, [-8+3,3+3]=[-5,6], 0 in\n\nτ=2, [-8+6,3+6]=[-2,9], 0 in\n\nτ=3, [-8+9,3+9]=[1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo covers at τ=0,1,2.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, at which τ (relative to t_1=17) x=0 is covered by some car, so unsafe if player is there.\n\ny=1: only unsafe at τ=0, but we start at y=6, so for future, if we go to y=1, need to avoid τ=0, but τ=0 is past, so for τ>=1, y=1 is always safe? From above, for y=1, only car at τ=0 covers, so for τ>=1, no car covers x=0, so safe.\n\ny=1: car covers only at τ=0, so for τ>=1, safe.\n\ny=2: unsafe at τ=3 (from second car)\n\ny=3: same as y=2, unsafe at τ=3\n\ny=4: unsafe at τ=1\n\ny=5: unsafe at τ=1\n\ny=6: what about y=6? We need to check freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6 has car (54,43,right,6), which never covers x=0, so y=6 is always safe? But we are at y=6 at τ=0, need to check if safe.\n\nAt τ=0, for y=6, is there a car covering x=0?\n\nFreeway 6 car: at τ=0, span [43,54], not including 0, so no, safe.\n\nAnd since no other times, always safe.\n\ny=7: freeway 7 has two cars.\n\nUnsafe when either car covers x=0.\n\nFirst car covers at τ=0 and τ=1\n\nSecond car covers at τ=11,12,13\n\nSo unsafe at τ=0,1,11,12,13\n\ny=8: freeway 8, unsafe at τ=0,1,2\n\nNow, we start at τ=0, y=6.\n\ny=6 is safe at τ=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so no cars, always safe.\n\nBut to reach y=9, we must be at y=8 at some turn and then move up.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=8, we need to be at y=7 or y=8 and stay, etc.\n\nThe minimal turns: from y=6 to y=9, we need at least 3 actions: e.g., U to y=7, U to y=8, U to y=9.\n\nBut we need to ensure that at each step, when we are on a freeway, it is safe at that time.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- At turn when we are on y=7, it must be safe.\n\n- On y=8, must be safe.\n\ny=6 is always safe, so starting point is ok.\n\nNow, let τ be relative to t_1=17, so τ=0 is turn 17.\n\nWe are at y=6, τ=0.\n\nWe want to go to y=9 asap.\n\nOption 1: go up immediately.\n\nAt τ=0, action a_{t_1} = a_{17} = U, so y_{18} = 7.\n\nBut at τ=0, we are still at y=6 for collision at turn τ=0? Turn T: at turn T, we are at y_T.\n\nAt turn 17 (τ=0), we are at y=6.\n\nAfter action a_{17}, we set y_{18} = y_{17} + Δy.\n\nThen at turn 18 (τ=1), we are at y_{18}.\n\nFor collision at turn T: at that turn, we are at y_T, and check cars on y_T at time T.\n\nSo for turn 17 (τ=0): y=6, and we know y=6 is safe at τ=0.\n\nNow, we take action at turn 17: say U, then y_{18} =7.\n\nAt turn 18 (τ=1): y=7, and we need to check if y=7 is safe at τ=1.\n\nFrom above, y=7 is unsafe at τ=1 (because freeway 7 has car covering at τ=1).\n\nAt τ=1, y=7 is unsafe.\n\nIf we take U at turn 17, at turn 18 (τ=1), we are at y=7, which is unsafe, so collision.\n\nTherefore, we cannot go up immediately at turn 17.\n\nIf we take S at turn 17, then y_{18} =6 (stay), at turn 18 (τ=1), we are at y=6, which is safe.\n\nThen at turn 18, we can take action.\n\nBut we need to go to y=9.\n\nWe could take D, but that would go down to y=5, which might not help since we need to go up.\n\ny=5 is freeway, and unsafe at τ=1.\n\nBut let's list possible actions.\n\nSince we need to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nSpecifically, for y=7, unsafe at τ=0,1,11,12,13\n\nτ=0 is turn 17, τ=1 is turn 18, etc.\n\nBut at τ=0, we are at y=6, not y=7.\n\nWe need to be on y=7 at some safe time.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\ny=8 unsafe at τ=0,1,2\n\nNow, safe times for y=7: except τ=0,1,11,12,13, so safe for τ>=2 to τ=10, and τ>=14, etc.\n\nSimilarly y=8: unsafe τ=0,1,2, so safe for τ>=3.\n\ny=6 always safe.\n\nWe start at τ=0, y=6.\n\nWe can stay at y=6 for a while, or move.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need to pass through y=7 and y=8.\n\nThe earliest we can be at y=7 is at τ=1 if we move up at τ=0, but at τ=1, y=7 is unsafe.\n\nNext, we can be at y=7 at τ=2.\n\nHow?\n\nAt τ=0, we take action: if we take S, we stay at y=6 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1 (turn 18), we take U, to go to y=7 at τ=2? Let's see the turns.\n\nAt turn 17 (τ=0): position y=6\n\nAction a_{17}: if S, then y_{18} =6\n\nThen at turn 18 (τ=1): position y=6\n\nThen action a_{18}: if U, then y_{19} =7\n\nThen at turn 19 (τ=2): position y=7\n\nNow, at τ=2, y=7: is it safe?\n\ny=7 unsafe at τ=0,1,11,12,13; τ=2 not in, so should be safe? Freeway 7: first car covers τ=0,1; second car covers τ=11,12,13. So at τ=2, no car covers x=0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, we can then go to y=8.\n\nAt turn 19 (τ=2), y=7, safe.\n\nTake action U, then y_{20} =8\n\nAt turn 20 (τ=3), position y=8\n\nNow, y=8 at τ=3: is it safe?\n\ny=8 unsafe at τ=0,1,2; τ=3 not in, so safe? Freeway 8 covers τ=0,1,2, at τ=3, span [1,12], 0 not covered, so safe.\n\nThen at turn 20 (τ=3), y=8, take action U, to y_{21} =9\n\nThen at turn 21 (τ=4), position y=9, which is safe, no cars.\n\nSo we reached at turn 21, which is τ=4.\n\nNumber of turns: from turn 17 to turn 21, that's 5 turns? Let's count the actions.\n\nTurns: t=17,18,19,20,21.\n\nAt t=17: start y=6\n\nAfter action at t=17, to set y for t=18.\n\nThe sequence:\n\n- Turn 17 (τ=0): position y=6, take action S (stay), so y_{18} =6\n\n- Turn 18 (τ=1): position y=6, take action U, so y_{19} =7\n\n- Turn 19 (τ=2): position y=7, take action U, so y_{20} =8\n\n- Turn 20 (τ=3): position y=8, take action U, so y_{21} =9\n\n- Turn 21 (τ=4): position y=9, done.\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt turn 17 (τ=0): y=6, safe\n\nAt turn 18 (τ=1): y=6, safe\n\nAt turn 19 (τ=2): y=7, safe as above\n\nAt turn 20 (τ=3): y=8, safe\n\nAt turn 21 (τ=4): y=9, safe\n\nReached in 4 actions? From t=17 to t=21, actions at t=17,18,19,20.\n\nH=4 turns? The sequence of actions from t=17 to t=17+H-1.\n\nStart at t_1=17, after H actions, we reach at turn t_1 + H - 1? Let's see the turn index.\n\nThe player position: at turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter H actions, we have y_{t_1}, y_{t_1+1}, ..., up to y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nThe actions are a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H - 1}, and y_{t_1 + H} =9? No.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nAt turn t, we have y_t, then action a_t determines Δy_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nWe start at turn t_1=17, y_{17}=6\n\nWe want y_{T} =9 for some T.\n\nAfter actions from a_{17} to a_{T-1}, we set y_{18} to y_T.\n\ny_{T} =9.\n\nThe number of actions is from a_{17} to a_{T-1}, so H = T - t_1.\n\nSince we start at turn t_1, and after H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nSet t = turn number.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAction a_t taken, sets y_{t+1}.\n\nWe have y_{t_1} =6.\n\nWe want y_{t_f} =9 for some t_f >= t_1.\n\nThe actions are a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., a_{t_f - 1}, so H = t_f - t_1 actions.\n\nThen at turn t_f, we are at y_{t_f}=9.\n\nIn the sequence, we have actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_f - 1}, total H actions.\n\nIn the answer, it should be Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}, ..., up to Turn t_1 + H -1: a_{t_1 + H -1}, and after that, at turn t_1 + H, we are at y=9.\n\nIn my earlier plan:\n\nStart turn 17 (t_1=17), y=6.\n\nAfter action a_{17}: if S, then y_{18}=6\n\nAfter action a_{18}: if U, then y_{19}=7\n\nAfter action a_{19}: if U, then y_{20}=8\n\nAfter action a_{20}: if U, then y_{21}=9\n\nSo at turn 21, y=9.\n\nActions: a_{17}, a_{18}, a_{19}, a_{20} — 4 actions.\n\nH=4, and we reach at turn t_1 + H =17+4=21.\n\nt_f = t_1 + H.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=17 to t=20, i.e., t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn this case, H=4.\n\nBut is this minimal?\n\nWe could go faster?\n\nAt τ=0, if we go up, to y=7 at τ=1, but unsafe.\n\nGo down? But y=5 at τ=1 is unsafe, since y=5 unsafe at τ=1.\n\ny=5 unsafe at τ=1, as per earlier.\n\nAt τ=0, if we take D, to y=5 at τ=1, but y=5 at τ=1 is unsafe, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we take U at τ=0, to y=7 at τ=1, unsafe.\n\nSo we must take S at τ=0 to stay at y=6 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, we are at y=6, safe.\n\nNow at τ=1, we can take action.\n\nIf we take U, to go to y=7 at τ=2, which is safe, as above.\n\nThen proceed to y=8 at τ=3, safe, then to y=9.\n\nWe could at τ=1 take S again, but that would delay, so not minimal.\n\nOr take D, to y=5 at τ=2? But y=5 is safe only if not at unsafe time.\n\ny=5 unsafe at τ=1, but at τ=2?\n\ny=5: freeway 5, unsafe only at τ=1, as per earlier.\n\nAt τ=2, y=5 should be safe.\n\nBut if we go to y=5, we need to come back up, which takes more turns, so not minimal.\n\nSimilarly, other paths.\n\nSo the sequence I have seems minimal: stay at turn 17, then up, up, up at turns 18,19,20.\n\nIn terms of actions:\n\n- Turn 17: S\n\n- Turn 18: U\n\n- Turn 19: U\n\n- Turn 20: U\n\nThen at turn 21, y=9.\n\nBut let's confirm the positions and times.\n\nTurn 17 (τ=0): y=6, action S → y_{18}=6\n\nAt turn 17, collision: y=6, safe.\n\nTurn 18 (τ=1): y=6, action U → y_{19}=7\n\nAt turn 18, y=6, safe.\n\nTurn 19 (τ=2): y=7, action U → y_{20}=8\n\nAt turn 19, y=7, τ=2: safe, as no car covers x=0 on y=7 at τ=2.\n\nTurn 20 (τ=3): y=8, action U → y_{21}=9\n\nAt turn 20, y=8, τ=3: safe, as no car on y=8 at τ=3.\n\nTurn 21: y=9, done.\n\nNow, is there a way with fewer actions? H=3?\n\nWith 3 actions: from y=6, we need to reach y=9 in 3 steps.\n\nPossible sequences: U,U,U: y=6 →7→8→9\n\nBut at step: after a_{17}=U, y_{18}=7\n\nAt turn 18 (τ=1), y=7, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nS,U,U: a_{17}=S, y_{18}=6; a_{18}=U, y_{19}=7; a_{19}=U, y_{20}=8\n\nThen at turn 20, y=8, but we need y=9, not reached yet.\n\nWith three actions, we can be at y=8 or y=9 depending on actions.\n\nIf we do U,U,U: positions: turn17 y=6, after U: y_{18}=7; after U: y_{19}=8; after U: y_{20}=9. So at turn 20, y=9.\n\nActions at t=17,18,19: three actions, reach y_{20}=9.\n\nBut at turn 18 (τ=1), y=7, unsafe.\n\nIf we do U at t=17, but y=7 at τ=1 unsafe.\n\nDo D at t=17, to y_{18}=5; then U to y_{19}=6; U to y_{20}=7, still at y=7, not 9.\n\nTo reach higher, need more up actions.\n\nMinimal actions to go from 6 to 9 is three U, but we hit collision.\n\nWith S first: a_{17}=S, y_{18}=6; a_{18}=U, y_{19}=7; a_{19}=U, y_{20}=8. Now at turn 20, y=8, not 9. Need another action to go to y=9.\n\nSimilarly, if a_{17}=U, to y=7 at τ=1, unsafe.\n\na_{17}=D, to y=5 at τ=1, unsafe for y=5.\n\ny=5 at τ=1 unsafe.\n\nSo cannot reach in three actions without collision.\n\nWith two actions: impossible to go from 6 to 9.\n\nSo minimal H=4.\n\nIn my sequence, H=4 actions: S, U, U, U at t=17,18,19,20.\n\nBut at t=20, we take U to go to y=9 at t=21.\n\nIn the sequence, the last action is at t=20 for a_{20}, setting y_{21}=9.\n\nNow, but in the freeways, we have y=7 and y=8 at safe times.\n\nIn my sequence, we were on y=7 at τ=2 (turn 19), y=8 at τ=3 (turn 20).\n\nNow, are there any other constraints?\n\nWhat about y=9? No issue.\n\nBut the goal is to reach (0,9), which we do at turn 21.\n\nThe sequence of actions: from t=17 to t=20.\n\nAnswer should be:\n\nTurn 17: S\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nBut let's write in the box.\n\nIn the format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nt_1=17.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 17: S\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nAnd H=4.\n\nBut is there a way with H=3? I think not, as above.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=7 earlier, but τ=0 and τ=1 are unsafe, so earliest safe for y=7 is τ=2.\n\nSimilarly for y=8, earliest safe is τ=3.\n\nThen from there to y=9.\n\nWe could go to y=8 directly from y=6, but to go from y=6 to y=8, we need two actions: e.g., U to y=7, then U to y=8, but we need to be at safe times.\n\nIf we go U at τ=0 to y=7 at τ=1, unsafe.\n\nOr if we go at later time.\n\nBut we start at τ=0.\n\nAnother idea: at τ=0, take S, stay at y=6.\n\nThen at τ=1, take U to y=7 at τ=2, as before.\n\nAt τ=1, we are at y=6, we could take U directly to y=7 at τ=2.\n\nNo faster.\n\nSuppose we take S at τ=0, then at τ=1, take U to y=7 at τ=2.\n\nThen at τ=2, take U to y=8 at τ=3.\n\nThen at τ=3, take U to y=9.\n\nThat's what we have.\n\nIf at τ=2, we are at y=7, we could stay or something, but no need.\n\nSo I think H=4 is minimal.\n\nNow, about the cars: I think I covered all.\n\nBut let me double-check y=7 at τ=2.\n\nFreeway 7: cars: first car covers τ=0 and 1, not τ=2.\n\nSecond car covers τ=11,12,13, not τ=2.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8 at τ=3: freeway 8 covers τ=0,1,2, not τ=3.\n\nSafe.\n\ny=6 always safe.\n\nNow, the answer should be the sequence.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nIn the answer format, it shows the sequence, not H explicitly, but H is implied.\n\nNow, write the actions.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 17: S\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nAfter that, at turn 21, y=9.\n\nTo be precise, the actions are for turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1, which is 17 to 20.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be listed as:\n\nTurn 17: a_{17} = S\n\nTurn 18: a_{18} = U\n\nTurn 19: a_{19} = U\n\nTurn 20: a_{20} = U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's make sure about the collision note.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so not collided by cars on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nIn my sequence, for example, at turn 19 (τ=2), we are at y=7, and we take U, moving to y=8 at next turn.\n\nBut at turn 19, we are on y=7, so we check cars on y=7 at τ=2, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nAnother thing: when we are at y=8 and move to y=9, y=9 has no cars, so fine.\n\nI think it's correct.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=9 directly, but no, we have to move step by step.\n\nSo, minimal H=4.\n\nNow, the sequence.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 6) at turn \\(t_1 = 17\\) with the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined to be optimal and collision-free.\n\n### Analysis:\n- The player starts at \\(y = 6\\) at turn 17 (\\(\\tau = 0\\) relative to \\(t_1 = 17\\)).\n- Freeway \\(y = 6\\) is always safe, as no car covers \\(x = 0\\) at any time.\n- Freeway \\(y = 7\\) is unsafe at times \\(\\tau = 0, 1, 11, 12, 13\\) due to car coverage of \\(x = 0\\).\n- Freeway \\(y = 8\\) is unsafe at times \\(\\tau = 0, 1, 2\\) due to car coverage of \\(x = 0\\).\n- The earliest safe time to be on \\(y = 7\\) is \\(\\tau = 2\\) (turn 19), and the earliest safe time to be on \\(y = 8\\) is \\(\\tau = 3\\) (turn 20).\n- Moving directly up at turn 17 (\\(\\tau = 0\\)) would place the player on \\(y = 7\\) at turn 18 (\\(\\tau = 1\\)), which is unsafe. Similarly, moving down or other actions lead to delays or unsafe states.\n- The minimal sequence involves:\n  - Staying at \\(y = 6\\) for turn 17 (action S) to avoid moving to an unsafe position.\n  - Moving up to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 19 (\\(\\tau = 2\\)), which is safe.\n  - Moving up to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 20 (\\(\\tau = 3\\)), which is safe.\n  - Moving up to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 21, which is always safe as it is not a freeway.\n- This sequence requires \\(H = 4\\) turns (actions at turns 17 to 20), reaching (0, 9) at turn 21.\n\n### Collision-Free Verification:\n- **Turn 17 (\\(\\tau = 0\\))**: Player at \\(y = 6\\). Freeway 6 is safe (no car covers \\(x = 0\\)).\n- **Turn 18 (\\(\\tau = 1\\))**: Player at \\(y = 6\\). Freeway 6 is safe.\n- **Turn 19 (\\(\\tau = 2\\))**: Player at \\(y = 7\\). Freeway 7 is safe at \\(\\tau = 2\\) (no car covers \\(x = 0\\)).\n- **Turn 20 (\\(\\tau = 3\\))**: Player at \\(y = 8\\). Freeway 8 is safe at \\(\\tau = 3\\) (no car covers \\(x = 0\\)).\n\n### Minimal Sequence:\nThe actions are as follows, with \\(H = 4\\):\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 17: S \\\\\nTurn 18: U \\\\\nTurn 19: U \\\\\nTurn 20: U\n}",

The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9. Since we're going to y=9 from y=6, moving up makes sense, but we have to avoid cars.\n\nCollision happens at turn T if the player is on freeway y_T and for that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at that turn. The player is only on a freeway at turn T if they are moving to it or staying, but the note says: if you move to y_{T+1} at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} until turn T+1. Let me read that carefully.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at each turn, the player is on a specific row, and collision is checked only for that row at that turn.\n\nWhen you take an action at turn T, it affects your position at turn T+1.\n\nThe player update is: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, you choose a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nBut the position is given for turn t₁, which is (0, y_{t₁}), so at turn t₁, you are at y_{t₁} = 6.\n\nThen, when you choose a_{t₁}, it will set y_{t₁ +1} = y_{t₁} + Δy_{t₁}.\n\nSimilarly, for collision: at turn T, you are at position (0, y_T), and collision occurs if for freeway k = y_T, 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nThe span is given for the cars at turn t₁, and we need to compute it for future turns.\n\nThe car update rules:\n\nFor a car on freeway i, at turn T > t₁, span is:\n\nIf left-moving: [h - s(T - t₁), τ - s(T - t₁)]? Let's see the notation.\n\nIt says: for left-moving: Span(t₁) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T - t₁), τ - s(T - t₁)]\n\nBut [h, τ] might not be in order; I think h and τ are positions, and for left-moving, it moves left, so positions decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: [τ, h] → [τ + s(T - t₁), h + s(T - t₁)], so here τ is the tail, h is head, and for right-moving, head is to the right, I assume.\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (48, 1, right, 48), so head=48, tail=1? But for right-moving, it says [τ, h], so τ is smaller, h is larger.\n\nIn freeway 1: (48, 1, right, 48), but 48 and 1, 48>1, so if right-moving, head should be larger, so h=48, τ=1? But in the tuple it's (head, tail, direction, speed), I think.\n\nLook at the car state table:\n\n| Freeway k | Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s) |\n\nFor k=1: (48, 1, right, 48) — so head=48, tail=1, direction=right, speed=48.\n\nFor k=2: (24,13,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12) — head=24, tail=13? 24>13, but for right-moving, if head is larger, tail should be smaller? 24>13, so tail=13, head=24, so the car is from 13 to 24? But direction right, so moving right.\n\nSimilarly, (-24,-35,right,12), head=-24, tail=-35, -24 > -35, so from -35 to -24, moving right.\n\nFor left-moving, like k=4: (-24,11,left,36) — head=-24, tail=11? -24 < 11, so if left-moving, head should be smaller or larger? Direction left, so moving left, positions decreasing.\n\nIn the update: for left-moving, Span(T) = [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]\n\nSince it's moving left, both ends decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, both increase.\n\nThe span is a range, and we need to see if 0 is in that range at turn T.\n\nCollision if player is on that freeway at turn T and 0 ∈ Span(T) for some car on that freeway.\n\nNow, the player starts at turn t₁=18, position y=6.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is the top, and we're at y=6, we need to move up, but we might need to wait or move down to avoid cars, but moving down might not help since we need to go up eventually, and y=0 might be safe, but we need to reach y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways; freeways are y=1 to y=8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nThe grid is vertical axis y=0,1,2,...,9, and freeways with cars are y=1 to y=8.\n\nSo y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so safe to be there.\n\nPlayer can be at y=0 or y=9 without collision risk.\n\nBut we need to reach (0,9), which is at y=9.\n\nNow, from y=6, we need to get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns without cars would be 3 turns: U,U,U to go from 6 to 7,8,9.\n\nBut with cars, we might need to wait or detour.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their positions at turn t₁=18.\n\nFreeway k=1: one car: head=48, tail=1, direction=right, speed=48.\n\nSince direction right, and head=48 > tail=1, so at t₁, span [1,48]? But in the update, for right-moving, it should be [τ, h] with τ < h, so here τ=1, h=48, so span at t₁: [1,48]\n\nThen at turn T, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)] = [1 + 48(T-18), 48 + 48(T-18)]\n\nSimilarly, for k=2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: head=24, tail=13, direction=right, speed=12.\n\nSo τ=13, h=24, span at t₁: [13,24]\n\nAt T: [13 + 12(T-18), 24 + 12(T-18)]\n\nSecond car: head=-24, tail=-35, direction=right, speed=12.\n\nτ=-35, h=-24, span at t₁: [-35,-24]\n\nAt T: [-35 + 12(T-18), -24 + 12(T-18)]\n\nk=3: same as k=2, two cars: (24,13,right,12) and (-24,-35,right,12), so identical to k=2.\n\nk=4: one car: head=-24, tail=11, direction=left, speed=36.\n\nDirection left, so for left-moving, span at t₁: [h, τ] = [-24,11]? But h=-24, τ=11, and since left-moving, positions decrease.\n\nIn the update: left-moving, Span(t₁) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]\n\nBut [h, τ] might not be ordered; in this case, h=-24, τ=11, so if we take [h, τ] as is, it's [-24,11], but since left-moving, the smaller position is head? I think it's better to think of the min and max.\n\nThe span is a contiguous block, so for left-moving, at t₁, the positions are from min to max, but with head and tail.\n\nIn the description, for left-moving, it says Span(t₁) = [h, τ], but h and τ are given, and for left-moving, head is the left end, I assume.\n\nIn k=4: head=-24, tail=11, direction left, so head at -24, tail at 11, but since left-moving, the car is moving left, so at t₁, it occupies from min to max? -24 to 11? But that's a wide range.\n\nPerhaps head and tail define the ends, with head being the front when moving.\n\nSince it's moving left, head is the leftmost point, tail is the rightmost? But in the update, for left-moving, Span(T) = [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)], so if h and τ are the positions, and it moves left, both decrease.\n\nIn this case, for k=4, head=-24, tail=11, so at t₁, the span is from -24 to 11, and since left-moving, both ends move left with speed 36.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut -24 to 11 is a large span, length 35, but speed is 36, so it might be moving.\n\nSimilarly, k=5: same as k=4, (-24,11,left,36)\n\nk=6: (60,49,right,6), so head=60, tail=49, direction right, speed 6, so τ=49, h=60, span at t₁ [49,60], at T: [49 +6(T-18), 60+6(T-18)]\n\nk=7: two cars: (8,-3,right,4) and (-40,-51,right,4)\n\nFirst car: head=8, tail=-3, direction right, speed 4. Since right-moving, τ should be smaller, here tail=-3, head=8, -3<8, so τ=-3, h=8, span [ -3,8 ] at t₁, at T: [-3 +4(T-18), 8+4(T-18)]\n\nSecond car: head=-40, tail=-51, direction right, speed 4, τ=-51, h=-40, span [-51,-40] at t₁, at T: [-51 +4(T-18), -40+4(T-18)]\n\nk=8: one car: (6,-5,right,3), head=6, tail=-5, direction right, speed 3, τ=-5, h=6, span [-5,6] at t₁, at T: [-5 +3(T-18), 6+3(T-18)]\n\nNow, the player is at y=6 at turn 18.\n\nWe need to find actions to go to y=9.\n\nSince we need to go up, and y=6,7,8,9 are the rows.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so when we reach y=9, no collision.\n\nBut we need to be on y=6,7,8 at various turns, and avoid when 0 is in the car span for that row.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, when 0 is in the span, i.e., when the car covers position 0.\n\nSince collision is only if 0 is in span at the turn we are on that row.\n\nFor each row k, and for each car on that row, find the times T when 0 ∈ Span(T).\n\nThen, for the player, when on row k at turn T, it must not be one of those times.\n\nNow, since the cars are moving, we can find the intervals when 0 is covered.\n\nLet δt = T - t₁ = T - 18\n\nSo for each car, find when 0 is in Span(T).\n\nStart with freeway k=1: one car, span at T: [1 + 48δt, 48 + 48δt] for δt = T-18\n\n0 ∈ [1 + 48δt, 48 + 48δt]\n\nSince 1 + 48δt > 0 for δt >=0, and 48 +48δt >0, so 0 < 1 +48δt <= 0? No, 1 +48δt >=1 >0, so 0 is always less than the lower bound, so 0 never in this span for any T. Because min position is at least 1 +48*0 =1 >0.\n\nAt δt=0, [1,48], 0 not in; as δt increases, positions increase, so 0 never in. So for k=1, 0 is never covered, so no collision possible on row 1 at any time. So row 1 is always safe.\n\nk=2: two cars.\n\nFirst car: span at T: [13 + 12δt, 24 + 12δt]\n\n0 ∈ [13+12δt, 24+12δt] ?\n\n13+12δt <= 0 <= 24+12δt\n\nBut 13+12δt >=13 >0 for δt>=0, so 0 < 13+12δt, so never true. Thus 0 not in first car span.\n\nSecond car: span [-35 +12δt, -24 +12δt]\n\n0 ∈ [-35+12δt, -24+12δt]\n\nSince -35+12δt <= -24+12δt <0 for small δt, and increases.\n\nSet -35+12δt <= 0 <= -24+12δt\n\nFirst inequality: -35+12δt <= 0 => 12δt <=35 => δt <= 35/12 ≈ 2.9167\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -24+12δt => 12δt >=24 => δt >=2\n\nSo for δt >=2 and δt <= 35/12 ≈2.9167, so δt from 2 to 2.9167\n\nSince δt integer? Turns are discrete, so T integer, δt integer.\n\nδt = T - 18, integer.\n\nSo 0 ∈ span when 2 <= δt <= 2 since 35/12=2.916, so δt=2\n\nδt=2: lower bound -35+12*2 = -35+24= -11\n\nUpper bound -24+12*2= -24+24=0\n\nSo at δt=2, span [-11,0], so 0 is included, since upper bound is 0.\n\nSimilarly, δt=3: lower -35+36=1, upper -24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nδt=1: lower -35+12=-23, upper -24+12=-12, [-23,-12], all negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo only at δt=2, i.e., T=18+2=20, 0 is in the span of second car on k=2.\n\nBut k=2 has two cars, but first car never covers 0, so for row 2, collision only possible at T=20 if a car covers 0.\n\nAt T=20, for the second car, 0 is covered.\n\nNow for k=3: same as k=2, since identical cars, so same thing, on row 3, collision possible only at T=20.\n\nk=3 has same cars as k=2, so yes.\n\nk=4: one car, direction left, head=-24, tail=11, speed 36.\n\nSpan at T: [h - s δt, τ - s δt] = [-24 -36 δt, 11 -36 δt]\n\n0 ∈ [-24 -36 δt, 11 -36 δt]\n\nSet -24 -36 δt <= 0 <= 11 -36 δt\n\nFirst: -24 -36δt <=0 => -36δt <=24 => multiply by -1, reverse inequality, 36δt >= -24, always true since δt>=0.\n\nBetter:\n\n-24 -36δt <= 0 => -36δt <= 24 => divide by -36, reverse: δt >= -24/36 = -2/3, but δt >=0, so always true.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 11 -36 δt => 36 δt <=11 => δt <= 11/36 ≈ 0.3056\n\nAlso, since the span must contain 0, we need the lower bound <=0 and upper bound >=0.\n\nLower bound: -24 -36δt <=0, which is true for all δt since -24-36δt <= -24 <0.\n\nUpper bound: 11 -36δt >=0 => 36δt <=11 => δt <= 11/36 ≈0.3056\n\nFor integer δt, δt <= 0.305, so δt=0\n\nAt δt=0, span [-24,11], which includes 0.\n\nδt=1: lower -24-36= -60, upper 11-36= -25, [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at δt=0, T=18, 0 is covered.\n\nBut T=18 is the current turn, t₁=18.\n\nAt turn T=18, if player is on row k=4, collision possible.\n\nBut player starts at y=6, not on row 4.\n\nSimilarly for k=5: same as k=4, so row 5 has collision only at T=18.\n\nk=6: one car, right-moving, head=60, tail=49, speed 6.\n\nSpan at T: [49 +6 δt, 60 +6 δt]\n\n0 ∈ [49+6δt, 60+6δt]? 49+6δt >=49>0, so never, since min position >0. So row 6 always safe.\n\nk=7: two cars.\n\nFirst car: head=8, tail=-3, right, speed 4, so τ=-3, h=8, span at T: [-3 +4 δt, 8 +4 δt]\n\n0 ∈ [-3+4δt, 8+4δt]\n\n-3+4δt <=0 <=8+4δt\n\nFirst: -3+4δt <=0 => 4δt <=3 => δt <= 3/4=0.75\n\nSecond: 0 <=8+4δt always true for δt>=0.\n\nSo only when -3+4δt <=0 and since upper bound always >=8>0, we need lower bound <=0 and upper bound >=0, upper bound always >=8>0, so only need lower bound <=0.\n\n-3+4δt <=0 => δt <= 0.75\n\nFor integer δt, δt=0\n\nAt δt=0, span [-3,8], includes 0.\n\nδt=1: [-3+4,8+4]=[1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at δt=0, T=18.\n\nSecond car on k=7: head=-40, tail=-51, right, speed 4, τ=-51, h=-40, span at T: [-51+4δt, -40+4δt]\n\n0 ∈ [-51+4δt, -40+4δt]? -51+4δt <= -40+4δt <0 for small δt.\n\nSet -51+4δt <=0 <= -40+4δt\n\nFirst: -51+4δt <=0 => 4δt <=51 => δt <= 51/4=12.75\n\nSecond: 0 <= -40+4δt => 4δt >=40 => δt >=10\n\nSo for δt >=10 and δt <=12.75, so δt=10,11,12\n\nAt δt=10: lower -51+40= -11, upper -40+40=0, [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nδt=11: lower -51+44= -7, upper -40+44=4, [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nδt=12: lower -51+48= -3, upper -40+48=8, [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nδt=13: lower -51+52=1, upper -40+52=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for second car, 0 covered at δt=10,11,12, T=28,29,30.\n\nNow for row k=7, collision if 0 covered by any car on that row.\n\nFirst car covers 0 only at T=18, second car at T=28,29,30.\n\nSo overall for row 7, collision at T=18,28,29,30.\n\nk=8: one car, head=6, tail=-5, right, speed 3.\n\nτ=-5, h=6, span at T: [-5 +3 δt, 6 +3 δt]\n\n0 ∈ [-5+3δt, 6+3δt]\n\n-5+3δt <=0 <=6+3δt\n\nFirst: -5+3δt <=0 => 3δt <=5 => δt <= 5/3 ≈1.666\n\nSecond: 0 <=6+3δt always true.\n\nSo need -5+3δt <=0, which for integer δt, δt=0,1\n\nAt δt=0: span [-5,6], includes 0.\n\nδt=1: [-5+3,6+3]=[-2,9], includes 0.\n\nδt=2: [-5+6,6+6]=[1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for row 8, collision at T=18 and T=19 (since δt=0, T=18; δt=1, T=19)\n\nNow, summarize for each row, the unsafe times (when 0 is covered by some car on that row):\n\n- y=1: always safe (no car covers 0)\n\n- y=2: unsafe only at T=20\n\n- y=3: unsafe only at T=20 (same as y=2)\n\n- y=4: unsafe only at T=18\n\n- y=5: unsafe only at T=18\n\n- y=6: let's see, k=6, we have car, but earlier we said row 6 always safe, since car span min 49>0.\n\nk=6: car from 49 to 60, moving right, always positions >=49>0, so 0 never covered, safe always.\n\n- y=7: unsafe at T=18,28,29,30\n\n- y=8: unsafe at T=18,19\n\n- y=0 and y=9: no freeway, always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at turn 18, y=6.\n\nAt turn 18, y=6 is safe, since row 6 always safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe path: we can go directly up or wait.\n\nMinimal turns: if we go up immediately.\n\nAt turn 18, position y=6.\n\nChoose action a_{18}, which sets y_{19} = y_{18} + Δy\n\nIf a_{18} = U, then y_{19} = 6 +1 =7\n\nThen at turn 19, player on y=7.\n\nBut row 7 is unsafe at T=19? Unsafe times for y=7: T=18,28,29,30\n\nT=19 is not unsafe, only 18,28,29,30, so at T=19, y=7 is safe.\n\nThen from y=7, if a_{19}=U, y_{20}=8\n\nAt turn 20, on y=8.\n\nRow 8 unsafe at T=18,19, but T=20? Earlier for y=8, unsafe at T=18 and T=19.\n\nT=20: δt=2, for k=8, span at δt=2: [-5+3*2,6+3*2]=[-5+6,6+6]=[1,12], 0 not in, so safe at T=20.\n\nSimilarly, if a_{20}=U, y_{21}=9, reached.\n\nNow, at turn 19, y=7 is safe, as above.\n\nTurn 20, y=8 is safe.\n\nThen turn 21, y=9.\n\nBut we need to check if at each step, when we are on the row, it is safe.\n\nAt turn 18: we are on y=6, which is safe.\n\nAction a_{18}: if U, then at turn 19, we are on y=7.\n\nAt turn 19: y=7, and since T=19 not in unsafe times (18,28,29,30), safe.\n\nThen action a_{19}: if U, then at turn 20, we are on y=8.\n\nAt turn 20: y=8, and row 8 safe at T=20, as above.\n\nThen action a_{20}: U, then at turn 21, y=9, done.\n\nBut at turn 21, we are at y=9, which is safe, no cars.\n\nThe sequence: from turn 18 to 21, actions U,U,U.\n\nH=3 turns? From t=18 to t=20 actions, then at t=21 position is 9.\n\nDefine the turns.\n\nStart at turn t₁=18, position y_{18}=6.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t₁ + H, position y_{t₁ + H}.\n\nWe need y_{t₁ + H} =9.\n\nAfter first action at t₁, y_{t₁+1} = y_{t₁} + Δy_{t₁}\n\nAfter second action, y_{t₁+2} = y_{t₁+1} + Δy_{t₁+1}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t₁ + H, position y_{t₁ + H} = y_{t₁} + sum of Δy from t to t+H-1.\n\nWe need y_{t₁ + H} =9.\n\nSince y_{t₁}=6, we need to increase by 3, so at least 3 Up actions, and no Down, but we might have Stay, which would increase H.\n\nMinimal H is 3, with three Ups.\n\nIn the above, with U at t=18,19,20, we have:\n\n- At turn 18: on y=6, safe\n\n- Action a_{18}=U, so y_{19}=7\n\n- At turn 19: on y=7, safe (T=19 not unsafe)\n\n- Action a_{19}=U, y_{20}=8\n\n- At turn 20: on y=8, safe (T=20 not unsafe)\n\n- Action a_{20}=U, y_{21}=9\n\n- At turn 21: on y=9, safe\n\nAnd we reached at turn 21.\n\nBut is there any issue?\n\nWe need to check row 7 at turn 19, which is safe.\n\nBut row 7 has unsafe times at T=18,28,29,30. T=19 is fine.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 at T=20 is fine.\n\nBut at turn 20, row 2 and row 3 are unsafe, but we are not on them, so no problem.\n\nIn this path, we are only on rows 6,7,8 at turns 18,19,20 respectively.\n\nAll safe.\n\nSo minimal H=3, actions U,U,U.\n\nBut the answer should be for turns starting from t₁.\n\nIn the sequence: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nt₁=18.\n\nSo Turn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nThen at turn 21, position (0,9)\n\nBut the actions are for t from t₁ to t₁ + H-1, and after H actions, at turn t₁+H, position is 9.\n\nIn this case, H=3 actions at t=18,19,20, position at t=21 is 9.\n\nIs there a reason to take more turns? Probably not, since we can go directly.\n\nBut let me confirm the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, at turn 18, row 7 is unsafe, but if we go to row 7 at turn 19, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 unsafe at turn 18 and 19, but at turn 20 it is safe.\n\nIn the path, we are on row 8 at turn 20, which is safe.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier? But from y=6 to y=9, minimum 3 moves, so H=3 is minimal.\n\nUnless we can be at y=9 at turn 18, but no, we start at y=6.\n\nSo H=3 should be possible.\n\nBut let me check if at any point there might be collision.\n\nThe note about moving: when we take action at turn T to move to different row, we are not on that row until next turn.\n\nIn this case, no issue.\n\nPerhaps for row 6, but row 6 always safe.\n\nAnother thing: the car on row 8 at turn 20: span [1,12], not covering 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly all good.\n\nBut in the car list, for row 7, there is a car that covers 0 at T=28,29,30, but we are not there at that time.\n\nSimilarly, row 2 and 3 unsafe at T=20, but we are on row 8 at that time.\n\nSo no conflict.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is three Ups.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions\"\n\nH is the number of actions? In the task: \"minimal number of turns H\" and \"sequence of actions {a_{t₁ + t} for t=0 to H-1\"\n\nAfter H actions, we reach at turn t₁ + H.\n\nIn this case H=3, actions at t=18,19,20.\n\nPerhaps I should write the sequence.\n\nBut is there a reason to consider waiting? For example, if we stay at y=6 for one turn, then go up, but that would take more turns, H=4 or more, not minimal.\n\nSimilarly, going down to avoid something, but since we need to go up, and no immediate threat, it should be fine.\n\nAt turn 18, if we stay, y=6, safe, but then we still need to go up later, so H larger.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo H=3 with U,U,U.\n\nBut let me confirm the starting point.\n\nPlayer at (0,6) at turn 18.\n\nAfter action U at turn 18, position at turn 19 is (0,7)\n\nThen U at 19, position at 20 is (0,8)\n\nU at 20, position at 21 is (0,9)\n\nAt each turn, when on the row:\n\nTurn 18: on y=6, row 6 safe.\n\nTurn 19: on y=7, row 7 safe at T=19.\n\nTurn 20: on y=8, row 8 safe at T=20.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps I should check if row 7 is safe at other times, but no need.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}  (which is U for t=18)\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 +1}  (U for t=19)\n\n...\n\nUp to t_1 + H-1\n\nH=3, so t from 18 to 20.\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so t=0: t_1, t=1: t_1+1, ..., t=H-1: t_1 + H-1\n\nActions at those times.\n\nThen at time t_1 + H, position is 9.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for this case, it seems straightforward.\n\nBut perhaps I missed something.\n\nAnother row: for example, row 4 and 5 are unsafe at T=18, but we are not on them.\n\nRow 2 and 3 unsafe at T=20, but at T=20 we are on row 8.\n\nNo issue.\n\nPerhaps the player could go through other rows, but no need.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nBut the problem has multiple cars, and for row 7, at T=19, it is safe, but let me confirm the car positions.\n\nFor row 7 at T=19: t=19, δt=1\n\nFirst car: span at T: [-3 +4*1, 8+4*1] = [1,12], not covering 0.\n\nSecond car: at δt=1, span [-51+4*1, -40+4*1] = [-47,-36], not covering 0.\n\nSo yes, safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 8 at T=20: δt=2, span [-5+6,6+6]=[1,12], not 0.\n\nGood.\n\nSo minimal H=3, actions U,U,U.\n\nBut the answer should be in boxed.\n\nPerhaps I need to write it.\n\nBut the initial position is (0,6), and we go to (0,9) directly.\n\nBut in the car states, for example, freeway 8 has a car that at turn 18 and 19 covers 0, but at 20 not.\n\nBut we avoid it by being there at T=20.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nSo I think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 6) at turn \\(t_1 = 18\\) and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Safe and Unsafe Times for Each Freeway\nBased on the car states at turn \\(t_1 = 18\\) and their movement rules, the times when position 0 is covered by a car on each freeway (making that freeway unsafe) are as follows:\n\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: Always safe (no car covers position 0 at any turn).\n- **Freeway 2 (y=2)**: Unsafe only at turn \\(T = 20\\) (car spans cover position 0).\n- **Freeway 3 (y=3)**: Unsafe only at turn \\(T = 20\\) (car spans cover position 0).\n- **Freeway 4 (y=4)**: Unsafe only at turn \\(T = 18\\) (car span covers position 0).\n- **Freeway 5 (y=5)**: Unsafe only at turn \\(T = 18\\) (car span covers position 0).\n- **Freeway 6 (y=6)**: Always safe (car span minimum position is 49 > 0 at all turns).\n- **Freeway 7 (y=7)**: Unsafe at turns \\(T = 18, 28, 29, 30\\) (car spans cover position 0 at these turns).\n- **Freeway 8 (y=8)**: Unsafe at turns \\(T = 18, 19\\) (car span covers position 0 at these turns).\n- **y=0 and y=9**: Always safe (no freeways, no cars).\n\n### Path to Reach (0, 9) Minimally\nThe player starts at (0, 6) at turn 18. Since row 6 is safe at turn 18, and the goal is to reach row 9 with minimal turns, the optimal sequence involves moving up directly:\n\n- At turn 18, choose action \\(U\\) (up) to move to row 7 at turn 19.\n  - Turn 19: Player is on row 7. Row 7 is safe at \\(T = 19\\) (unsafe only at 18, 28, 29, 30).\n- At turn 19, choose action \\(U\\) to move to row 8 at turn 20.\n  - Turn 20: Player is on row 8. Row 8 is safe at \\(T = 20\\) (unsafe only at 18 and 19).\n- At turn 20, choose action \\(U\\) to move to row 9 at turn 21.\n  - Turn 21: Player is on row 9, which is always safe.\n\nThis sequence reaches (0, 9) in 3 turns (actions at turns 18, 19, and 20), which is minimal since at least 3 up moves are required to go from row 6 to row 9.\n\n### Verification of Collision Avoidance\n- **Turn 18**: Player on row 6 (safe).\n- **Turn 19**: Player on row 7 (safe, as \\(T = 19\\) not unsafe for row 7).\n- **Turn 20**: Player on row 8 (safe, as \\(T = 20\\) not unsafe for row 8).\n\nNo collisions occur, and the position at turn 21 is (0, 9).\n\n### Minimal Sequence\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H = 3\\) with actions at turns \\(t_1 = 18\\), \\(t_1 + 1 = 19\\), and \\(t_1 + 2 = 20\\):\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 18: U \\\\\nTurn 19: U \\\\\nTurn 20: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,7) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t₁ = 19.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9. Since we start at y=7 and need to get to y=9, we need to move up twice. But we have to avoid the cars on the intermediate lanes.\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T (between 1 and 8) and 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at that turn. Importantly, when you move to a new y, you're not on that new y until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T you're still on y, and you arrive at y+1 at turn T+1. That means when you decide to move, you only check for collision on your current lane at the current turn, not on the lane you're moving to.\n\nThe car positions are given for turn t₁=19, and we need to compute their positions at future turns based on their speed and direction.\n\nLet me list all the cars for each freeway. Freeways are y=1 to y=8.\n\nFrom the table:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car: (head=96, tail=49, direction=right, speed=48)\n\nSince direction is right, for a right-moving car, the span is [tail, head], so at t₁=19, span is [49, 96]? No, it says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, it says span is [τ, h], so tail is the left end, head is the right end.\n\nIn the update rule:\n\nFor left-moving: span at t₁ is [h, τ], and it moves left, so h decreases.\n\nFor right-moving: span at t₁ is [τ, h], and it moves right, so both increase.\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor freeway 1: (96, 49, right, 48). Direction right, so since it's right-moving, the span should be [tail, head] = [49, 96]. At turn T, position is [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut in the collision condition, we care about whether 0 is in the span at turn T for the freeway we're on.\n\nAlso, since the player is at (0,y), we only care about x=0, so if 0 is within the car's span at that turn.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=7 at turn t₁=19.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe freeways to worry about are y=7 and y=8, since we start at y=7, and need to go to y=9, so we might pass through y=8.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and it's not a freeway, so no cars there, so once we reach y=9, we're safe.\n\nBut to reach y=9, we need to be at y=8 and then move up, or something.\n\nLet's think about the sequence.\n\nAt turn t₁=19, player is at y=7.\n\nWe can choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf we move up, at turn 20, we'll be at y=8.\n\nIf we stay, at turn 20, still y=7.\n\nIf down, to y=6, but that might not help since we need to go up.\n\nSimilarly, from y=8, we can go to y=9.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 when there's a car covering x=0 at that turn.\n\nAlso, since we might need to wait, we could stay or move down temporarily, but that might increase H, and we want minimal turns, so probably we want to go directly if possible.\n\nMinimal H: since from y=7 to y=9, the shortest path is two moves: U then U, taking two turns, to be at y=9 at turn 21.\n\nStart turn 19 at y=7.\n\nAfter action at turn 19, position at turn 20.\n\nThen action at turn 20, position at turn 21.\n\nSo if we do U at turn 19, then at turn 20 we are at y=8.\n\nThen U at turn 20, at turn 21 we are at y=9.\n\nH=2 turns, actions at t=19 and t=20.\n\nBut we need to check if at turn 19, when we are on y=7, is there a car on y=7 covering x=0?\n\nSimilarly, at turn 20, when we are on y=8, is there a car covering x=0?\n\nIf not, we can do it directly.\n\nNow, what about the cars? Freeway 7 and 8.\n\nFirst, freeway 7: y=7.\n\nAt turn t₁=19, cars on freeway 7: from table, (12, 1, right, 4) and (-36, -47, right, 4)\n\nBoth right-moving, so for right-moving cars, span is [tail, head].\n\nFirst car: head=12, tail=1, so span [1,12] at t=19.\n\nSince right-moving, at turn T, span is [τ + s(T-19), h + s(T-19)] = [1 + 4(T-19), 12 + 4(T-19)]\n\nSimilarly, second car: head=-36? head=-36, tail=-47, direction right, speed 4.\n\nTail=-47, head=-36, so span [τ, h] = [-47, -36] at t=19.\n\nAt turn T, [ -47 + 4(T-19), -36 + 4(T-19) ]\n\nWe care about whether 0 is in the span at a given turn.\n\nFor freeway 7 at turn 19: we need to check if player is on y=7 at turn 19.\n\nAt turn 19, player is on y=7, so we need to see if for any car on y=7, 0 is in span at T=19.\n\nFirst car: span [1,12] at T=19, 0 not in [1,12] since 1>0.\n\nSecond car: span [-47,-36], all negative, 0 not in it.\n\nSo at turn 19, no collision on y=7.\n\nNow, if we move up at turn 19, at turn 20 we are on y=8.\n\nNow, at turn 20, we are on y=8, so check cars on y=8.\n\nFreeway 8: from table, (9, -2, right, 3)\n\nOne car: head=9, tail=-2, direction right, speed=3.\n\nSo at t=19, span [τ, h] = [-2,9]\n\nAt turn T, span [ -2 + 3(T-19), 9 + 3(T-19) ]\n\nAt turn T=20, span [ -2 + 3(1), 9 + 3(1) ] = [-2+3, 9+3] = [1,12]\n\n0 not in [1,12], so no collision.\n\nThen at turn 20, we move up to y=9, at turn 21 we are at y=9, which is the goal.\n\nBut at turn 20, when we are on y=8, we take action U, so at turn 21, y=9.\n\nAnd since y=9 has no cars, no issue.\n\nSo it seems we can reach in two moves: U at t=19, U at t=20.\n\nBut is that correct? Let me confirm the collision rules.\n\nAt turn 19: we are on y=7. Cars on y=7: spans as above, no car covers 0, so safe.\n\nAction U: move to y=8 at next turn.\n\nAt turn 20: we are now on y=8. Cars on y=8 at turn 20: span [1,12] as calculated, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nThen action U: move to y=9 at turn 21.\n\nAt turn 21, we are at y=9, goal reached.\n\nH=2 turns.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we do at turn 21.\n\nBut let me check if there are any issues with other freeways? No, because we only were on y=7 and y=8, and we checked those.\n\nBut just to be thorough, at turn 19, we start at y=7, we don't go through other y's.\n\nSimilarly at turn 20, we are on y=8.\n\nSo no other freeways involved.\n\nBut in the car state, there are multiple cars, but for y=7 and y=8, we have the cars.\n\ny=7 has two cars, but neither covers 0 at the relevant times.\n\nSimilarly for y=8.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on freeway 8.\n\nAt turn 20, T=20, t₁=19, Δt=1, span [ -2 + 3(1), 9 + 3(1) ] = [1,12], yes.\n\n0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 19, y=7 cars: [1,12] and [-47,-36], both not covering 0.\n\nBut what about at other turns? For example, if we stayed longer, but we don't need to.\n\nBut in this case, it seems fine.\n\nBut the player is at (0,y), so we only care about x=0.\n\nBut let me see the other freeways, just in case.\n\nFor example, freeway 6: (-48, -59, right, 6)\n\nThis is y=6, but we are not on y=6, so irrelevant.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5: (-60, -25, left, 36)\n\nLeft-moving, so for left-moving, span is [h, τ], I think.\n\nFrom the update: left-moving, span at t₁ is [h, τ], then at T, [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor left-moving, direction left, so at t₁, span is [h, τ], since head is the front, I assume.\n\nIn the update rule: for left-moving, \"Span(t₁) = [h, τ]\"\n\nThen moves left, so decreases.\n\nSo for freeway 5: (-60, -25, left, 36)\n\nSo h=-60, τ=-25, direction left, so span at t₁=19: [h, τ] = [-60, -25]? But -60 < -25, so [ -60, -25 ] would be from left to right? But since it's left-moving, and x decreasing.\n\nThe span is a set of positions, so [min, max] I think, but in the notation, for left-moving, [h, τ] might imply h is left or right?\n\nLet's see the update: for left-moving, span at t₁ is [h, τ], and at T, [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]\n\nSince it moves left, both decrease, so if at t₁, [h, τ], with h and τ, but which is larger?\n\nIn the example, for freeway 5: h=-60, τ=-25, so if [h, τ] = [-60, -25], and -60 < -25, so it's from -60 to -25.\n\nThen at T, [ -60 - s(T-t₁), -25 - s(T-t₁) ]\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, [τ, h] with τ and h, for freeway 1: τ=49, h=96, so [49,96].\n\nNow for freeway 5 at y=5, but we don't care.\n\nBut back to our plan.\n\nIn the sequence I have, at turn 19, on y=7, safe.\n\nAction U, go to y=8 at turn 20.\n\nAt turn 20, on y=8, car span [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction U, go to y=9 at turn 21.\n\nBut the goal is to reach (0,9), which we do at turn 21.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t=19 to t=20, H=2.\n\nBut let me confirm if at turn 20, when we are on y=8, the car is not covering 0.\n\n[1,12] at T=20, 0 not in.\n\nBut what about the car on freeway 7 at turn 20? But we are not on y=7 at turn 20, so irrelevant.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nBut there might be a car on y=8 at other times, but we are only there at turn 20.\n\nBut let me see if the car on y=8 covers 0 at some point.\n\nThe car on y=8: at T, span [ -2 + 3(T-19), 9 + 3(T-19) ]\n\nSet 0 in the span: -2 + 3Δt <= 0 <= 9 + 3Δt, where Δt = T-19.\n\n-2 + 3Δt <= 0 and 0 <= 9 + 3Δt.\n\n0 <= 9 + 3Δt always true for Δt >=0.\n\n-2 + 3Δt <= 0 implies 3Δt <= 2, Δt <= 2/3, so for Δt=0, T=19, span [-2,9], -2<=0<=9? 0 is between -2 and 9? -2 <=0<=9, yes, 0 is in [-2,9] at T=19.\n\nAt turn T=19, for freeway 8, car span [-2,9], which includes 0.\n\nBut at turn 19, we are not on y=8; we are on y=7.\n\nAt turn 19, player is at y=7, so we only care about y=7 cars.\n\nAt turn 20, we are on y=8, and at turn 20, span is [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 19, for y=8, car covers 0, but we are not on y=8 at that time.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nNow, but in our plan, we are on y=8 only at turn 20, when it doesn't cover 0.\n\nSimilarly, for y=7, at turn 19, cars don't cover 0.\n\nBut let me check if on y=7, at turn 19, is there any car covering 0?\n\nFirst car: [1,12], 1 to 12, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [-47,-36], -47 to -36, all negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo safe.\n\nBut the second car on y=7 is (-36,-47)? No, in the table: (-36, -47, right, 4)\n\nhead=-36, tail=-47, right-moving, so span [τ, h] = [-47, -36], so positions from -47 to -36, 0 not in.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but we have freeway 6,7,8 to consider, but since we only traverse y=7 and y=8, and briefly.\n\nBut y=6 might be relevant if we move down, but we don't.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 19, we could stay or move down, but that would take more turns, so not minimal.\n\nBut is there a reason we cannot go directly?\n\nPerhaps at turn 19, if we go up, but let's see the cars at future turns.\n\nFor example, on y=8, at turn 20, safe, but what about if we were later.\n\nBut we are at turn 20.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if we need to wait.\n\nBut in this case, it seems fine.\n\nBut let me look at the car on freeway 7.\n\nAt turn 19, safe.\n\nBut what about at turn 20, if we were on y=7.\n\nAt turn 20, for y=7 cars.\n\nFirst car: at T=20, span [1 + 4(1), 12 + 4(1)] = [5,16], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [ -47 + 4(1), -36 + 4(1) ] = [-43, -32], 0 not in.\n\nBut we are not on y=7 at turn 20 in our plan.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nFreeway 8 has only one car.\n\nIn the table, freeway 8: (9, -2, right, 3), that's all.\n\nBut earlier I thought at T=19, it covers 0, but we are not there.\n\nIn our sequence, we are on y=8 only at T=20, with span [1,12].\n\nNow, but the player position: at turn 19, y=7.\n\nAfter action at turn 19, if U, then at turn 20, y=8.\n\nThen at turn 20, action U, at turn 21, y=9.\n\nNow, collision only when on the freeway at that turn.\n\nSo seems no problem.\n\nBut why do I feel like it might not be that simple? Perhaps I missed something.\n\nMaybe for freeway 7 or 8, there is a car that covers 0 at the time we are there.\n\nBut in this case, no.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the movement.\n\nAnother thing: when we move, we are on the current y until we move.\n\nIn the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nIn this case, for example, at turn T, we are on y_T, we take action to go to y_{T+1}, then at turn T, we are still on y_T, so only check cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nAt turn T+1, we are on y_{T+1}, so check cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nIn our case, at turn 19, on y=7, check y=7 cars at T=19.\n\nAt turn 20, on y=8, check y=8 cars at T=20.\n\nBoth safe.\n\nThen to y=9 at T=21.\n\nBut at T=21, we are at y=9, no freeway, so no check.\n\nSo H=2.\n\nBut the minimal H should be at least 2, since we need to increase y by 2.\n\nCan we do it in 1 turn? No, because from y=7, after one action, we can be at y=6,7,8, not 9. To reach y=9, we need to be at y=8 and move up, or at y=9 directly only if we start from y=8 or 9, but we start from 7.\n\nAfter one action, position changes to 6,7, or 8, not 9. Then after second action, from there to 5-9, so to reach 9, minimum two actions from y=7.\n\nSimilarly, H=2 is minimum possible.\n\nAnd we can achieve it, as above.\n\nBut perhaps for y=8, at turn 20, there is a car covering 0? But we have [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nUnless I miscomputed.\n\nt₁=19, T=20, Δt=1.\n\nCar on y=8: span at T: [ -2 + 3(Δt), 9 + 3(Δt) ] for Δt=1, [ -2+3, 9+3] = [1,12], yes.\n\n0 not in [1,12].\n\nSimilarly, at T=19, [-2,9], 0 in, but not relevant.\n\nNow, but in the car state, for freeway 8, it says (9, -2, right, 3), which is head=9, tail=-2, so [tail, head] = [-2,9] at t=19.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I should check if there are multiple cars on a freeway.\n\nFor example, freeway 2 and 3 have multiple cars, but we are not on them.\n\nFreeway 2: (36,25,right,12) and (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nBut y=2, not relevant.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3 same as 2? It says freeway 3: (36,25,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12) same as freeway 2? Probably different freeways.\n\nBut not relevant.\n\nFreeway 4: (-60,-25,left,36)\n\nLeft-moving, so span at t₁: [h, τ] = [-60, -25]? h=-60, τ=-25, and since left-moving, [h, τ] = [-60, -25], which is from -60 to -25.\n\nThen at T, [ -60 -36(T-19), -25 -36(T-19) ]\n\nBut y=4, not relevant.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSo I think for our path, no issue.\n\nBut perhaps the player could go down first or something, but that would take more turns, so not minimal.\n\nFor example, if we go to y=6, but then we have to come back, so H larger.\n\nSo minimal H should be 2 with actions U,U.\n\nBut let me see the answer format.\n\nIt should be like:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n\n...\n\nFor H=2, it would be two actions.\n\nt_1 = 19, so:\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nAnd done.\n\nBut perhaps I need to verify with the cars.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 19, we are at y=7, but is there a car on y=7 that will cover 0 soon? But we leave immediately.\n\nSimilarly, on y=8, at turn 20, no car.\n\nBut let me see when the car on y=8 covers 0.\n\nAs above, at T=19, [-2,9], 0 in.\n\nAt T=20, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nAt T=21, [4,15], etc., so only at T=19 it covers 0, but we are not there.\n\nSimilarly for y=7, when does it cover 0?\n\nFirst car on y=7: [1 + 4(Δt), 12 + 4(Δt)]\n\nSet 1 + 4Δt <= 0 <= 12 + 4Δt? 1 + 4Δt <=0 implies Δt <= -1/4, impossible since Δt>=0, so 0 never in for this car, since min is 1 at t=19.\n\nAt t=19, [1,12], min=1>0, so 0 not in, and increasing, so never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: [-47 + 4(Δt), -36 + 4(Δt)], all negative, since -47 +4Δt <= -36 +4Δt <0 for all Δt, so never covers 0.\n\nSo on y=7, no car ever covers 0, so always safe to be on y=7.\n\nOn y=8, car covers 0 only at exactly T=19, since at T=19, [-2,9] includes 0, at T=20, [1,12] does not, and before or after, but at T=18, for example, span [ -2 +3(-1), 9 +3(-1) ] = [-5,6], -5<=0<=6, yes, covers 0 at T=18.\n\nAt T=20, [1,12] not.\n\nBut since we are on y=8 only at T=20 in our plan, safe.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps the problem is that at turn 19, if we go up, but we are not affected.\n\nBut let me see the initial position: (0,7) at turn 19.\n\nNow, another thing: the freeway y=8 has a car that at turn 19 covers 0, but since we are not on it, ok.\n\nBut in the sequence, we never are on y=8 at turn 19.\n\nSo I think H=2 is possible.\n\nBut why are there other freeways listed? Maybe to confuse, or perhaps for other paths.\n\nBut since we can go directly, it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps I misread the car on freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8: (9, -2, right, 3)\n\nhead=9, tail=-2, right-moving, so [τ, h] = [-2,9] at t=19.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps the direction: right or left.\n\nAnother freeway: freeway 7 has two cars, but both not near 0.\n\nPerhaps for y=6, if we go down, but not necessary.\n\nI think I should proceed with H=2.\n\nBut let me see if at turn 19, we can go up immediately.\n\nPerhaps the player needs to avoid the cars when moving, but according to the rule, collision is only when on the freeway at that turn, not during movement, I think.\n\nThe movement is instantaneous between turns, I assume.\n\nSo only position at integer turns matter.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 2, with actions U at t=19 and U at t=20.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nIn the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 19: a_{19} = U\nTurn 20: a_{20} = U\n}\n\nBut it says \"a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1\", t_1=19, H=2, so t=0 to 1, so a_{19+0} = a_{19}, a_{19+1}=a_{20}.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{19 + 2 -1} = y_{20}, no.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = 19 + 2 -1 = 20, but at turn 20, after action, we are at y=8? Let's see.\n\nAt turn T, before action, position is y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, position at T+1 is y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nStart: at turn t_1=19, position (0,7)\n\nAction a_{19}: if U, then position at turn 20 is (0,8)\n\nThen at turn 20, action a_{20}: if U, then position at turn 21 is (0,9)\n\nWe need to reach (0,9), which is at turn 21.\n\nIn the task: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\"\n\nt_1 + H -1 = 19 + H -1\n\nSet equal to turn when we are at (0,9), which is turn 21.\n\nSo 19 + H -1 = 21, so 18 + H =21, H=3? That can't be right.\n\nI think I confused the indexing.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\nThe sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}\n\nAfter these H actions, we reach the position at turn t_1 + H.\n\nStart at turn t_1, position given.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, position at turn t_1 +1.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 +1}, position at turn t_1 +2.\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + (H-1)}, position at turn t_1 + H.\n\nWe want position at turn t_1 + H to be (0,9).\n\nIn the task: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"? No.\n\nLet me read.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\" no.\n\nIn the task section:\n\n\"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nLet me see.\n\n\"Find a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nBut y_{t_1 + H - 1} is the position at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nNow, from above:\n\nAt turn t_1, position y_{t_1}\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, position at turn t_1 +1 is y_{t_1 +1}\n\nSimilarly, after a_{t_1 + k}, position at turn t_1 + k +1.\n\nSo after H actions: a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, the position after last action is at turn t_1 + H.\n\nSo y_{t_1 + H} = position after H actions.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} is the position before the last action, I think.\n\nLet's clarify the turn indexing.\n\nDefine:\n\n- At the start of turn T, position is y_T.\n\n- We take action a_T.\n\n- Then position updates to y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy based on a_T.\n\nSo after action at turn T, we move to y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nNow, at current turn t_1, we have y_{t_1} =7.\n\nWe take actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, so H actions.\n\nAfter a_{t_1}, at turn t_1 +1, y_{t_1 +1}\n\nAfter a_{t_1 +1}, at turn t_1 +2, y_{t_1 +2}\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{t_1 + H -1}, at turn t_1 + H, y_{t_1 + H}\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9? But the task says y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nRead carefully:\n\n\"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nAnd \"reach (0,9)\"\n\nBut y_{t_1 + H -1} is at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, if H=1, then y_{t_1 +1 -1} = y_{t_1} =9, but we start at y=7, not 9.\n\nIf H=2, y_{t_1 +2-1} = y_{t_1 +1} =9.\n\ny_{t_1 +1} is position at turn t_1 +1.\n\nAt turn t_1, y_{t_1}=7.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, at turn t_1+1, y_{t_1+1} = y_{t_1} + Δy.\n\nWe want y_{t_1+1} =9 for H=2? But from y=7, with one action, we can go to y=8 max, not 9. So impossible for y_{t_1+1} to be 9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} for H=2 is y_{t_1 +1}.\n\nBut y_{t_1+1} <=8 from y=7.\n\nSimilarly, for H=3, y_{t_1 +3-1} = y_{t_1 +2} =9.\n\nAt turn t_1 +2, position y_{t_1 +2} can be 9.\n\nFor example, from y_{t_1}=7, after first action, y_{t_1+1} could be 6,7,8, then after second action, y_{t_1+2} could be 5 to 9.\n\nSo to have y_{t_1+2}=9, possible if we go to y=8 then to y=9.\n\nSimilarly, for H=3, we want y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{t_1 +2} =9.\n\nGeneral: we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nWith H actions, from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, the position after all actions is at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut we want position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nThat means before the last action, or something.\n\nLet's see the turn when position is 9.\n\nSet k = t_1 + H -1, we want y_k =9 for some k.\n\nSince we start at turn t_1, y_{t_1} =7.\n\nAfter m actions, we are at turn t_1 + m.\n\ny_{t_1 + m} is position after m actions.\n\nWe want y_k =9 for k = t_1 + H -1.\n\nSince y changes by at most 1 per turn, from y=7 to y=9, it takes at least 2 steps, so the earliest turn to be at y=9 is turn t_1 +2, with y_{t_1+2}=9.\n\nFor that, we need H such that t_1 + H -1 = t_1 +2, so H-1=2, H=3.\n\nThen y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{t_1 +2} =9.\n\nWith H=3 actions: a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, a_{t_1+2}, but the actions are from t=0 to H-1 for the index.\n\nActions: a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nAfter these, position at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut we want position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nFor example, with H=3, we want y_{t_1 +2} =9.\n\ny_{t_1 +2} is the position at turn t_1 +2, which is after two actions from start.\n\nAt turn t_1, y_{t_1}=7\n\nAfter a_{t_1}, y_{t_1+1} = new position\n\nAfter a_{t_1+1}, y_{t_1+2} = new position\n\nSo with two actions, we can reach y_{t_1+2}=9.\n\nThen for H=2, we would have actions a_{t_1} and a_{t_1+1}, leading to y_{t_1+2}.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{t_1 +1} for H=2? No.\n\nLet's solve the equation.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, position is 9.\n\nThis position is reached after (H-1) actions from turn t_1.\n\nBecause from turn t_1 to turn t_1 + H -1, there are (H-1) actions taken: from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -2}, leading to y_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have actions up to a_{t_1 + H -1}, which affects y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nI think there's a confusion in the indexing.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think that the sequence of actions determines the positions.\n\nStart: turn t_1, position y_{t_1} =7\n\nAction a_{t_1}: determines y_{t_1+1}\n\nAction a_{t_1+1}: determines y_{t_1+2}\n\n...\n\nAction a_{t_1 + k}: determines y_{t_1 + k +1}\n\nAfter H actions, we have set y_{t_1+1} to y_{t_1 + H}\n\nWe want y_{m} =9 for m = t_1 + H -1.\n\nSo for example, to have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThe turn when we are at y=9 is turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nFrom y=7 to y=9, minimum two steps, so the earliest turn to be at y=9 is turn t_1 +2.\n\nSo we need t_1 + H -1 = t_1 +2, thus H-1=2, H=3.\n\nThen with H=3, we want y_{t_1 +2} =9.\n\nAnd the actions are a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, a_{t_1+2} for t from 0 to 2? t from 0 to H-1=2, so three actions.\n\nBut with three actions, we can reach y_{t_1+3}, but we only care up to y_{t_1+2}=9.\n\nThe actions beyond are not needed, but we have to specify H actions.\n\nFor H=3, we specify a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, a_{t_1+2}, but after a_{t_1+2}, we are at y_{t_1+3}, which could be anything, but we don't care, as long as at turn t_1+2, we are at 9.\n\nThe position at turn t_1+2 is determined by actions up to a_{t_1+1}, because a_{t_1+1} determines y_{t_1+2}.\n\ny_{t_1+2} is determined by a_{t_1+1}, based on y_{t_1+1}.\n\nLet's list:\n\n- At turn t_1: y_{t_1} given\n\n- Action a_{t_1}: sets y_{t_1+1} = y_{t_1} + Δy(a_{t_1})\n\n- At turn t_1+1: y_{t_1+1}\n\n- Action a_{t_1+1}: sets y_{t_1+2} = y_{t_1+1} + Δy(a_{t_1+1})\n\n- At turn t_1+2: y_{t_1+2}\n\n- Action a_{t_1+2}: sets y_{t_1+3} = ...\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor example, to have y_{t_1+2} =9, we need H-1=2, so H=3.\n\nThen with H=3, we want y_{t_1 +2} =9.\n\ny_{t_1+2} is set by action a_{t_1+1}, based on y_{t_1+1}.\n\nTo reach y_{t_1+2}=9 from y_{t_1}=7, we need two actions: a_{t_1} and a_{t_1+1}.\n\nBut for H=3, we have three actions: a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, a_{t_1+2}.\n\na_{t_1+2} determines y_{t_1+3}, but we don't care about y_{t_1+3}, only that at turn t_1+2, we are at 9.\n\nSo for the last action, we can choose anything, since it doesn't affect y_{t_1+2}.\n\nBut in terms of collision, we need to be safe at the turns we are on freeways.\n\nSpecifically, at turn t_1 + H -1 = t_1+2 for H=3, we are at y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision issue.\n\nBut at earlier turns, we might be on freeways.\n\nFor minimal H, since we can reach in two steps to y=9 at turn t_1+2, with H=3.\n\nH=3 is the minimal number of actions to have y at turn t_1+2=9.\n\nWith fewer actions, say H=2, then y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{t_1 +1}, which can be at most 8, not 9.\n\nSimilarly, H=1, y_{t_1} =7 not 9.\n\nSo minimal H is 3, to have y_{t_1+2} =9.\n\nThen the actions: we need a_{t_1} and a_{t_1+1} to reach y_{t_1+2}=9 from y_{t_1}=7.\n\nFor example, U at t_1, then U at t_1+1, so y_{t_1+1} =8, then y_{t_1+2}=9.\n\nThen for the third action a_{t_1+2}, we can choose anything, say S, U, or D, but since at turn t_1+2, we are at y=9, not on freeway, no collision, so it doesn't matter.\n\nBut we have to specify the action.\n\nIn terms of the sequence, for H=3, actions at t_1, t_1+1, t_1+2.\n\nNow, for collision, we need to ensure that at each turn we are on a freeway, we don't collide.\n\nSpecifically, at turn t_1, we are on y=7, need safe.\n\nAt turn t_1+1, we are on whatever y we are, if between 1-8, need safe.\n\nAt turn t_1+2, if we are on y=9, safe, no issue.\n\nIn the case where we go directly: a_{t_1} = U, so at turn t_1+1, y=8.\n\nThen a_{t_1+1} = U, so at turn t_1+2, y=9.\n\nThen a_{t_1+2} can be S, for example.\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt turn t_1=19, on y=7: as before, cars on y=7 at T=19: spans [1,12] and [-47,-36], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction U: go to y=8 at turn 20.\n\nAt turn t_1+1=20, on y=8.\n\nCars on y=8 at T=20: as before, span [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen action U: but this action is at turn 20, which sets y_{21} = y_{20} +1 =9, so at turn 21, y=9.\n\nBut at turn 20, we are on y=8, taking action.\n\nThen after action, at turn 21, y=9.\n\nNow, at turn t_1+2=21, we are at y=9, which is not a freeway, so no collision check.\n\nThen we have a_{t_1+2} = a_{21}, which we need to specify, say S.\n\nBut since y=9, no issue.\n\nIn this case, with a_{19}=U, a_{20}=U, a_{21}=S, for example.\n\nThen at turn 21, we are at y=9.\n\nBut we reached y=9 at turn 21, which is t_1+2.\n\nAnd H=3.\n\nIf we do a_{21}=U, y_{22}=10, but y max 9, so probably not allowed, or capped at 9.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if at y=9, U would keep it at 9? Or error, but probably it stays or something.\n\nThe equation: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, but clipped to [0,9].\n\nIt says: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y_{t+1} \\in [0,9], so if out of bounds, it might be clipped, but not specified.\n\nIn the text: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_{t} , where ... , y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\"\n\nSo it is clipped to 0 or 9 if out of range.\n\nSo at y=9, if U, y_{t+1} = min(9, y_t +1) =9.\n\nSimilarly for D at y=0.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nBut in our case, for a_{21}, we can do S or U or D, but since y=9, U or D might not change, or S.\n\nBut it doesn't matter.\n\nNow back to the direct path: with a_{19}=U, a_{20}=U, we go to y=8 at turn 20, then to y=9 at turn 21.\n\nBut for H=3, we need three actions, so a_{19}, a_{20}, a_{21}.\n\nWith a_{19}=U, a_{20}=U, and a_{21}=S, for example.\n\nThen at turn 19, on y=7, safe.\n\nAt turn 20, on y=8, safe as before.\n\nAt turn 21, on y=9, safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut is there a way with fewer actions? H=3 is minimal as above.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier, but from y=7, earliest at turn t_1+2 to be at y=9.\n\nt_1+2 = 21.\n\nNow, in the sequence, for collision at turn t_1+1=20, on y=8, we have span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nBut is there any car that could be a problem?\n\nEarlier I thought for freeway 8, at turn 20, safe.\n\nBut let me confirm the car positions.\n\nt_1=19\n\nFreeway 8: one car, right-moving, tail=-2, head=9, speed=3.\n\nAt turn T, position: [ τ + s(T-19), h + s(T-19) ] = [ -2 + 3(Δt), 9 + 3(Δt) ] with Δt = T-19\n\nAt T=20, Δt=1, [ -2+3, 9+3] = [1,12], yes.\n\n0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways not relevant.\n\nSo with actions: Turn 19: U, Turn 20: U, Turn 21: S (or anything)\n\nBut in the sequence, we need to list for t from 0 to H-1.\n\nH=3, so t=0,1,2: a_{19}, a_{20}, a_{21}\n\na_{19}=U, a_{20}=U, a_{21}=S\n\nThen y_{20} =8 (after a_{19}), y_{21}=9 (after a_{20}), y_{22}=9 (after a_{21}, since S or U)\n\nAt turn 21, y=9, which is what we want for k=t_1 + H -1 =19+3-1=21, y_{21}=9.\n\nYes.\n\nIf we don't do the third action, but we have to specify H actions.\n\nPerhaps we can have a different sequence with H=3 but different actions.\n\nBut minimal turns, H is the number of actions, but we want minimal H, which is 3.\n\nIn terms of turns, from start to reaching, it takes 2 turns to reach, but with 2 actions, we reach at turn t_1+2, but with H=2 actions, y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{t_1 +1} which is not 9.\n\nSo H must be at least 3.\n\nWith H=3, it works.\n\nBut in this case, for freeway 8 at turn 20, is it safe? [1,12], 0 not in, yes.\n\nBut let me check if at turn 20, on y=8, there is a car.\n\nThe car is at [1,12], which is from x=1 to 12, so at x=0, not covered.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if we need to avoid due to other reasons.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 7, there is a car at (-36,-47), but moving right, so at T=20, [-43,-32], not near 0.\n\nBut all good.\n\nSo I think the sequence is a_{19}=U, a_{20}=U, a_{21}=S.\n\nBut we can choose a_{21} to be U or D, but since at y=9, it stays 9.\n\nS is fine.\n\nNow, in the answer, we need to output the actions.\n\nBut the problem is to avoid collisions, and in this case, no collision.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 8 again.\n\nFreeway 8: (9, -2, right, 3)\n\nAt T=20, [ -2 + 3(1), 9 + 3(1) ] = [1,12]\n\nBut is the span inclusive? [1,12] means x from 1 to 12, so x=0 not included.\n\nSimilarly, at T=19, [-2,9], includes x=0.\n\nBut not relevant.\n\nPerhaps for other freeways, but we are not on them.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=3, with actions U at 19, U at 20, and S at 21.\n\nBut to write in the box.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 19: a_{19} = U\nTurn 20: a_{20} = U\nTurn 21: a_{21} = S\n}\n\nBut it says \"a_{t_1 + t}\", with t_1=19, so for t=0, a_{19}, t=1, a_{20}, t=2, a_{21}.\n\nYes.\n\nSince a_{21} can be anything, but we have to specify.\n\nPerhaps we can have a shorter sequence if we start from different action.\n\nFor example, if at turn 19, we do S, then at turn 20, y=7, then U to y=8 at turn 21, then we need another action to go to y=9 at turn 22, but then H larger.\n\nFor example, to have y_{21}=9, with a_{19}=S, a_{20}=U, a_{21}=U, then y_{20}=7 (after S), y_{21}=8 (after U), y_{22}=9 (after U), so at turn 21, y=8, not 9. To have y_{21}=9, we need to be at y=8 at turn 20, then U at turn 20 to y=9 at turn 21.\n\nSo a_{19}=U to go to y=8 at turn 20, then a_{20}=U to go to y=9 at turn 21.\n\nThen a_{21} for the third action.\n\nSo same as before.\n\nIf we do D first, worse.\n\nSo direct up is best.\n\nThus, I think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 7) at turn \\(t_1 = 19\\) and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe minimal \\(H\\) to reach \\(y = 9\\) from \\(y = 7\\) is 3, as it requires at least two actions to increase the y-coordinate by 2, and \\(H = 3\\) satisfies the condition that \\(y_{t_1 + H - 1} = y_{19 + 3 - 1} = y_{21} = 9\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n- At turn 19, action \\(U\\) (up) moves the player to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 20.\n- At turn 20, action \\(U\\) (up) moves the player to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 21.\n- At turn 21, action \\(S\\) (stay) is chosen, as the player is already at \\(y = 9\\), and no further movement is needed. The action \\(S\\) has no effect on the position since \\(y = 9\\) is the goal.\n\nCollisions are avoided as follows:\n- At turn 19, the player is on freeway \\(y = 7\\). Cars on \\(y = 7\\) at turn 19:\n  - Car 1: Span at turn 19 is \\([1, 12]\\) (right-moving, speed 4), 0 not in span.\n  - Car 2: Span at turn 19 is \\([-47, -36]\\) (right-moving, speed 4), 0 not in span.\n  No collision occurs.\n- At turn 20, the player is on freeway \\(y = 8\\). Cars on \\(y = 8\\) at turn 20:\n  - Car: Span at turn 20 is \\([1, 12]\\) (right-moving, speed 3), 0 not in span.\n  No collision occurs.\n- At turn 21, the player is at \\(y = 9\\), which is not a freeway, so no collision check is needed.\n\nThus, the sequence achieves the goal in \\(H = 3\\) turns with no collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 19: \\ a_{19} = U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 20: \\ a_{20} = U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 21: \\ a_{21} = S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player is starting at (0, 8) at turn t_1 = 20. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. Since the player is already at y=8, and needs to get to y=9, I think moving up once should do it, but I have to make sure that when they move to y=9, they don't collide with any cars on y=9. But the freeways are only from y=1 to y=8, so y=9 might be safe. Let me check the collision definition.\n\nThe collision occurs only if, at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where y_T is between 1 and 8, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. Since the player is at x=0 always, I assume, because it's a vertical move.\n\nThe position is (x,y), but x is always 0 for the player, I think, since it says \"position (0, y_t)\" and \"reach (0,9)\". So the player only moves vertically, and cars are on horizontal freeways.\n\nFreeways are y=1 to y=8, each with cars moving left or right.\n\nNow, to reach (0,9), which is not a freeway, so no cars there. So as long as the player can get to y=9 safely from y=8.\n\nBut to get to y=9, they need to be at y=8 at some turn and then take action U to go to y=9.\n\nThe collision is checked at each turn when the player is on a freeway. Since y=9 is not a freeway, once they are there, no collision, I think.\n\nThe collision condition: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the player's y-position at turn T.\n\nSo if y_T is between 1 and 8, and for that row, at turn T, there is a car where 0 is in its span.\n\nFor y=9, since it's not a freeway, no cars, so no collision possible.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 might be safe, but the goal is y=9.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=8 at turn 20.\n\ny=8 is a freeway, so we need to check if at turn 20, on freeway 8, there is a car that covers x=0.\n\nLet's look at the car state for freeway 8.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFreeway 8: (12, 1, right, 3)\n\nDirection right, so it's moving right, meaning head is at 12, tail at 1? Let's see the notation.\n\nIn the car update, for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] where h is head, τ is tail? In the table it says \"head h, tail τ\", but in the update, for right-moving, it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" which might be from tail to head.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nIn the car state table, for each car, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nThen for update:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → moves left, so positions decrease.\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → moves right, positions increase.\n\nIn the right-moving case, Span(t1) = [τ, h] means from τ to h, with τ < h since moving right.\n\nIn the table, for freeway 8: (head=12, tail=1, direction=right, speed=3)\n\nSo at t1=20, Span = [τ, h] = [1, 12]? No.\n\nThe notation says: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\"\n\nSo [τ, h] is the span, with τ and h, but since moving right, τ should be left, h right, so [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nHere head=12, tail=1, so τ=1, h=12, so Span at t1=20 is [1,12] for x-positions.\n\nNow, at turn T, for collision, we need 0 ∈ Span(T) for some car on y_T.\n\nPlayer at turn 20 is on y=8, so we check freeway 8.\n\nCar on freeway 8: at t=20, Span = [1,12] for x from 1 to 12 inclusive? Since it's a span, I assume it's the set of points covered.\n\nThe span is a continuous set, so for [a,b], it includes all x such that a ≤ x ≤ b.\n\nIn this case, [1,12], so x=0 is not in [1,12], since 0 < 1.\n\nSo at t=20, on y=8, x=0 is not covered, so no collision at turn 20.\n\nThe player can choose to move up, down, or stay.\n\nIf they move up to y=9 at turn 21, since y=9 is not a freeway, no cars, so they are safe and reach the goal in one turn.\n\nBut is that possible? Action at turn t_1 (20) is a_t, which affects y_{t+1}.\n\nThe sequence starts from t=0 to H-1 relative to t_1, but t_1 is given as 20.\n\nLet's see the sequence: actions from t=0 to H-1 for the turns, meaning actions at times t_1, t_1+1, ..., up to t_1 + H - 1.\n\nAfter H actions, the position at time t_1 + H should be (0,9), I think.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t_1, the player is at position (0, y_{t_1}).\n\nThen they choose action a_{t_1}, which determines y_{t_1 + 1} = y_{t_1} + Δy, with Δy based on action.\n\nThen at turn t_1 + 1, they are at (0, y_{t_1 + 1}), and so on.\n\nThe goal is to have y_{t_1 + H} = 9? Let's see.\n\nIt says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\"? No.\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so actions at times t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H - 1.\n\nAfter these actions, the position at time t_1 + H should be the new position.\n\nAfter action at time t, position at t+1.\n\nSo after action at t_1 + H - 1, position at time (t_1 + H - 1) + 1 = t_1 + H.\n\nBut we want the position to be (0,9) at some turn.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\"? Let's read.\n\n\"minimizes H such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\ny_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nThe position at time t_1 + H - 1 is (0,9).\n\nNow, the actions are from t=0 to H-1, meaning actions at t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H - 1.\n\nAction at t affects position at t+1.\n\nSo position at time t is before action at time t, I think.\n\nStandard: at time t, position is (0, y_t), then choose action a_t, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo position at time t+1 is after action a_t.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9, meaning at time t_1 + H - 1, position is (0,9).\n\nThe actions are a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H - 2} for t from 0 to H-1? Let's index properly.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for t=0, action at t_1, for t=1, action at t_1+1, ..., for t=H-1, action at t_1 + H - 1.\n\nAction at time s affects position at time s+1.\n\nSo action at t_1 + k affects position at t_1 + k + 1.\n\nTo have position at time t_1 + H - 1 be (0,9), that means that the action at time t_1 + H - 2 determines y_{t_1 + H - 1} = y_{t_1 + H - 2} + Δy.\n\nBut for k=H-1, action at t_1 + H - 1 affects position at t_1 + H.\n\nBut we don't care about position at t_1 + H, only that at t_1 + H - 1 it is (0,9).\n\nSo the last action that matters is a_{t_1 + H - 2}, which sets y_{t_1 + H - 1}.\n\nBut in the sequence, we have actions up to a_{t_1 + H - 1}, which is after the position is already (0,9).\n\nThat seems inconsistent.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\" a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nAlso, in the action sequence, for t from 0 to H-1, actions at t_1 to t_1 + H - 1.\n\nBut if position at t_1 + H - 1 is 9, then the action at t_1 + H - 1 is taken when already at 9, which might not be necessary, but it could be a stay or something.\n\nPerhaps H is the number of actions, and after H actions, the position is at time t_1 + H.\n\nBut the problem says y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9, so at time t_1 + H - 1.\n\nLet's see the initial position.\n\nAt time t_1, position is given as (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,8).\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, position at t_1+1 is y_{t_1+1} = y_{t_1} + Δy.\n\nWe want that for some T, y_T = 9, with T = t_1 + H - 1.\n\nSo T = t_1 + H - 1.\n\nThe actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H - 1} are applied.\n\nThe action a_{t_1} affects position at t_1+1, a_{t_1+1} affects position at t_1+2, ..., a_{t_1 + H - 2} affects position at t_1 + H - 1, and a_{t_1 + H - 1} affects position at t_1 + H, which is after T.\n\nSo for position at T = t_1 + H - 1 to be 9, it is determined by actions up to a_{t_1 + H - 2}.\n\nThe action a_{t_1 + H - 1} is not needed for reaching 9 at T, but it might be included in the sequence if H is defined that way.\n\nIn the sequence, for t=0 to H-1, it includes a_{t_1 + H - 1}, which is the action at the time when position is already 9.\n\nBut since the position is already 9, and we might stay or do something, but to reach, it's not necessary, but for the sequence, we have to specify it.\n\nBut in this case, since we want minimal H, we can probably set that action to S or something.\n\nFor the goal, when y_T = 9, it is reached, and no further action is needed, but the sequence includes H actions.\n\nPerhaps for H=1, we have one action a_{t_1}, which, if U, sets y_{t_1+1} = 9, but y_{t_1+1} is at time t_1+1, but we want y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nFor H=1, t_1 + H - 1 = t_1 +1 -1 = t_1, so we want y_{t_1} = 9, but at t_1, y=8, not 9, so H=1 is impossible.\n\nLet's solve for H.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nAt time t_1, y_{t_1} = 8.\n\nAfter k actions, position at time t_1 + k.\n\nAfter 0 actions, position at t_1.\n\nAfter 1 action (a_{t_1}), position at t_1+1.\n\nAfter m actions, position at t_1 + m.\n\nWe want position at time t_1 + H - 1 to be 9.\n\nAfter (H-1) actions, position at t_1 + (H-1) = t_1 + H - 1.\n\nSo to have y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9, we need to apply (H-1) actions starting from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H - 2}, which set the position from t_1 to t_1+1 to ... to t_1 + H - 1.\n\nThen the action a_{t_1 + H - 1} is at time t_1 + H - 1, position is already 9, and it affects position at t_1 + H, which is not relevant for reaching.\n\nBut for the sequence, we have to include it, so for minimal H, we might have to include this extra action.\n\nBut that seems wasteful; probably for reaching at time T, the actions should be up to a_{T-1}.\n\nI think there's a confusion in the indexing.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think that the position at turn t is after the action or before.\n\nLet's assume that at the start of turn t, position is (0,y_t), then action a_t is chosen, then the position is updated to y_{t+1} for the start of turn t+1.\n\nThe turn number is when the action is taken.\n\nAt turn t, action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe position at turn t is y_t before the action.\n\nBut in the collision check, at turn T, we check based on y_T, the row at that turn.\n\nIn the problem, \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\ny_T is the position at turn T.\n\nSo at turn T, when we are at position y_T, and if y_T between 1 and 8, we check the cars on that row at time T.\n\nThen after action a_T, we go to turn T+1 with position y_{T+1}.\n\nFor the goal, we want at some turn T, y_T = 9.\n\nSpecifically, at turn t_1 + H - 1, y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nActions are from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H - 1}.\n\nFor example, to reach y=9 at turn S, we need the actions from a_t for t from t_1 to S-1 to move from y=8 to y=9 in (S - t_1) steps, but since we start at t_1 with y=8, to be at y=9 at turn S, we need to have moved up once, so S = t_1 +1, and action a_{t_1} = U.\n\nThen at turn S = t_1 +1, y=9.\n\nIn terms of H, we want S = t_1 + H - 1, so t_1 + H - 1 = t_1 +1, thus H-1 =1, H=2.\n\nThen for H=2, we want y_{t_1 + 2 - 1} = y_{t_1 +1} =9.\n\nActions: from t=0 to H-1=1, so a_{t_1 +0} and a_{t_1 +1}, i.e., a_{t_1} and a_{t_1 +1}.\n\na_{t_1} should be U to set y_{t_1+1} =9.\n\nThen at turn t_1 +1, position is (0,9), so we have reached.\n\nThen a_{t_1 +1} is the action at turn t_1 +1, which can be S, for example, since we are already at 9.\n\nSimilarly, for any H, we have to include the action at the time when we are at 9.\n\nBut for minimal turns, we want to reach as soon as possible, so minimal S such that y_S =9, with S = t_1 + H - 1, so minimal H.\n\nThe earliest S is t_1 +1, with y_{t_1+1} =9, which requires moving up from y=8 at turn t_1.\n\nSo H-1 =1, H=2.\n\nThen we need to check if at turn t_1, when we are at y=8, is it safe? And at turn t_1, we take action, but collision is at the turn based on position before action or after?\n\nCollision is at turn T based on position y_T.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T, and if on freeway, we check cars at that turn.\n\nThen we choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}, but the collision for that turn is only based on y_T, not on the action.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but not Span(T+1).\"\n\nBut for the current position at turn T, it's y_T.\n\nIn this case, for turn t_1=20, y=8, we need to check if at turn 20, on y=8, is there a car covering x=0.\n\nAs I thought earlier, car on y=8: at t=20, span [1,12] for right-moving car, so x=0 not covered, so safe.\n\nThen if we take action U at turn 20, we go to y=9 at turn 21.\n\nAt turn 21, y=9, not a freeway, no collision.\n\nSo with H=2, we can reach at turn 21 (since S= t_1 + H -1 =20 +2 -1=21).\n\nActions: a_{20} = U, and a_{21} = ? Since at turn 21 we are at y=9, we can set a_{21} to S, for example.\n\nBut the sequence should be for t from 0 to H-1, so two actions.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1+1} = S (or anything, but S is fine)\n\nBut is there any reason why we cannot do this? Only if at turn 20, on y=8, it was unsafe, but it is safe.\n\nBut let's confirm the car positions.\n\nFreeway 8 at t=20: car with head=12, tail=1, right-moving, speed=3.\n\nSpan at t=20: since right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [1,12], so positions x from 1 to 12 inclusive, I assume.\n\nx=0 is not in [1,12], so no collision.\n\nThen moving up should be fine.\n\nBut the player is at (0,8), and cars are on the freeway, so for collision, it's only when on the same y and x=0 covered.\n\nHere not covered.\n\nMoreover, to reach y=9, we need to be at y=8 and move up, which we can do now.\n\nBut the problem is to avoid collisions at all turns until reaching, but at turn 20 it is safe, and at turn 21 it is not on freeway, so no issue.\n\nPerhaps I need to check if by moving up, we might be on y=9 at the same turn or something, but no, the position changes at the next turn.\n\nSo with one move up, we can reach in the next turn.\n\nBut with H=2, as above.\n\nPerhaps we can reach at turn 20, but y=8 ≠9, so impossible.\n\nSo minimal H should be 2.\n\nBut let's see if there is any car that might cause issue.\n\nThe player needs to be on y=8 to move up, but at that moment it must be safe.\n\nHere at t=20 it is safe.\n\nBut maybe at other times, if we delay, but since we can do it immediately, why not.\n\nBut let's check other freeways, but since we are only on y=8 at turn 20, and then to y=9, we don't go to other rows, so no need to check other cars.\n\nUnless we move down or something, but that would take more turns, not minimal.\n\nSo H=2 should be fine.\n\nBut let's see the car states; there are cars on other rows, but since we are not there, irrelevant.\n\nFor example, on y=7, there are cars, but we are not on y=7 at any turn if we go directly to y=9 from y=8.\n\nAt turn 20, we are on y=8, take action U, to y=9 at turn 21.\n\nNo other positions.\n\nSo I think it's straightforward.\n\nBut why is the initial position (0,8), and cars given? Perhaps for this case, it is safe to move up immediately.\n\nMaybe I misread the car on y=8.\n\nFreeway 8: (12,1,right,3)\n\nAt t=20, [1,12], x=0 not covered.\n\nSpeed 3, so at later times, it moves right, so span increases, but at t=20, fine.\n\nPerhaps for the action, if we stay or something, but moving up is direct.\n\nAnother thing: the note about not being on the next row at the same turn.\n\nBut in this case, not relevant.\n\nPerhaps on y=9, but no freeway.\n\nSo I think with H=2, actions: a_{20} = U, a_{21} = S.\n\nBut a_{21} can be anything, but S is fine.\n\nIn the sequence, for H=2, we need to specify two actions.\n\nNow, in the answer, it should be for turn t_1=20.\n\nBut let's see the output format.\n\nIt says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., with t_1 given as 20.\n\nSo for this case:\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: S\n\nBut is S necessary? Since at turn 21, we are at (0,9), which is the goal, and no further action is needed, but the sequence includes it, so we have to put something.\n\nPerhaps we can have H such that the last action sets the position to 9.\n\nFor example, if we want y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9, and with actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H - 2} setting the position, and a_{t_1 + H - 1} at the time when position is 9.\n\nBut to minimize H, we should set H so that we reach as soon as possible.\n\nEarliest at turn 21 with y=9.\n\nWith H=2, S = t_1 + H -1 =20+2-1=21.\n\nIf H=1, S=20+1-1=20, but y=8≠9.\n\nSo H=2 is minimal.\n\nPerhaps we can reach at turn 20, but impossible.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut let's double-check if at turn 20, on y=8, it is indeed safe.\n\nCar: direction right, head=12, tail=1, so at t=20, positions from 1 to 12, x=0 not included.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but there is another car on freeway 7, but we are not on freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7 has two cars: (16,5,right,4) and (-32,-43,right,4)\n\nBut we are not on y=7, so irrelevant.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo I think moving up immediately is safe and minimal.\n\nBut the player is at y=8, and needs to go to y=9, so only one move up.\n\nBut let's confirm the vertical axis: y=0 to 9, so from 8 to 9 is possible.\n\nAction U increases y by 1, to 9.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps there is a reason we cannot move up, like if at that time x=0 is covered, but it is not.\n\nUnless I misread the car.\n\nFreeway 8: only one car, (12,1,right,3)\n\nSpan [1,12].\n\nx=0 clear.\n\nSo why is this a problem? Perhaps I need to consider the future when moving, but for collision, it's per turn based on current position.\n\nMaybe for the action, when we move, the position changes instantly, but the note clarifies that we are not on the new row until next turn.\n\nIn this case, not relevant.\n\nSo I think for this, minimal H is 2.\n\nBut let's see the car states; there might be something I missed.\n\nFor example, on freeway 2 and 3, there are cars at (0,-11,right,12), which at t=20, if on y=2 or 3, x=0 might be covered.\n\nFor freeway 2: cars (48,37,right,12) and (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFirst car: head=48, tail=37? Direction right, so span [τ, h] = [37,48]? Head and tail.\n\nIn notation, head h, tail τ, for right-moving, span [τ, h].\n\nSo for first car: head=48, tail=37, so [37,48], x from 37 to 48.\n\nSecond car: head=0, tail=-11, so span [τ, h] = [-11,0].\n\nx from -11 to 0 inclusive.\n\nSo at x=0, it is covered, since 0 is in [-11,0].\n\nSimilarly for freeway 3, same cars.\n\nBut we are not on y=2 or 3, so no issue.\n\nAt turn 20, we are on y=8, not affected.\n\nSo for our path, only y=8 matters, which is safe.\n\nTherefore, we can move up immediately.\n\nSo sequence: a_{20} = U, a_{21} = S.\n\nBut to write in the box.\n\nAnswer should be:\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: S\n\nSince t_1=20.\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" so for t_1=20.\n\nBut let's make sure about the car on y=8 at future times, but we don't care, since we leave immediately.\n\nPerhaps if we stay, it might be unsafe later, but we don't stay.\n\nAt turn 20, we move up.\n\nAnother thing: the car on y=8 has speed 3, so at turn 21, span will be [1+3,12+3] = [4,15] since moving right, so x=0 not covered, but we are not on y=8 at turn 21.\n\nAt turn 21, we are on y=9.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, I think it's correct.\n\nBut the problem has multiple cars, and perhaps for other starting positions it might be different, but here it seems simple.\n\nMaybe I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut H=2, actions U and S.\n\nS for stay at turn 21.\n\nSince we are at goal, we can choose any action, but S is fine.\n\nTo save characters, but not necessary.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: S\n}\n\nBut in the format, it should be for general t_1, but here t_1 given as 20.\n\nThe answer should include the turns with numbers.\n\nPerhaps write \"Turn 20: U\" and \"Turn 21: S\"\n\nYes.\n\nBut let's see if there is a reason to go down or something, but that would take more turns, not minimal.\n\nFor example, if we go down to y=7, but y=7 has cars, and it might be unsafe or take time, unnecessary.\n\nSo minimal is directly up.\n\nTherefore, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) at turn \\(t_1 = 20\\).
