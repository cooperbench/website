        "thinking": "<think>First, the current turn is t1 = 0. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (5,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the edges and one wall at (5,6).\n\nSnake positions: only one segment at (3,3), so the snake is just the head, length 1. Head direction is left, so it's facing L (left).\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (2,1) with value 1 and life span 10\n\n- (2,3) with value 1 and life span 10\n\n- (3,1) with value 1 and life span 10\n\nAll food is positive, value +1, so eating any will increase length by 1.\n\nSince the snake is only one segment, there's no body to worry about except the head itself. Also, with length 1, the tail is the head, so if I eat food, the snake will grow to length 2.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid. Assume (0,0) is bottom-left, so x increases right, y increases up. Walls: x=0 left, x=7 right, y=0 bottom, y=7 top. Obstacle at (5,6).\n\nSnake head at (3,3), direction L, so it just moved left to (3,3)? Positions are given as [(3,3)], and head direction is L, meaning it's facing left, so it could have come from the right, but since it's the only segment, it doesn't matter. For movement, since direction is L, I cannot move right immediately because of no instant reverse. So possible moves: U (up), D (down), L (left), but moving left might hit the wall or something.\n\nCurrent position (3,3). Possible moves:\n\n- U: (3,4)\n\n- D: (3,2)\n\n- L: (2,3)  // since direction is L, moving left is allowed\n\n- R: (4,3) but since current direction is L, moving right would be opposite, so not allowed. No instant reverse.\n\nSo allowed moves: U, D, L.\n\nNow, check if these cells are safe.\n\n- (3,4): is this a wall? Walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (5,6). (3,4) is within bounds, not a wall, so safe.\n\n- (3,2): similarly, within bounds, not a wall, safe.\n\n- (2,3): also within bounds, not a wall, safe.\n\nNo body segments, so no collision risk except walls.\n\nFood locations:\n\n- (2,1) - below left\n\n- (2,3) - left, same y as head but x=2\n\n- (3,1) - directly below, same x, y=1\n\nHead at (3,3), so:\n\n- (2,3) is adjacent left, one move away.\n\n- (3,1) is two moves down: first to (3,2), then to (3,1).\n\n- (2,1) is two moves: e.g., left to (2,3), then down to (2,1) or down to (3,2), then left to (2,2) but (2,2) has no food, then to (2,1).\n\nBut (2,3) has food, so moving left directly to (2,3) would eat it.\n\nLife span: all food has life span 10, so they will disappear after 10 turns, including this turn, I think. \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 0, life span 10, so it will disappear after 10 more turns? Let's see.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo at turn t, if food has life span L, it will be there for L more turns, including turn t. After L turns, it disappears.\n\nFor example, at turn 0, life span 10, it will be present on turns 0 to 9, and disappear at turn 10.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, since snake is at (3,3), and I need to eat food to grow.\n\nBut I must think long-term. Also, with length 1, eating food will make length 2, so tail will be where I eat, and head moves, so after eating, the tail stays for one turn before moving if I move away, but let's see.\n\nFirst, if I move left to (2,3), that has food. So on turn 0, move L to (2,3), eat the food. Since value is +1, snake grows to length 2. New positions: head at (2,3), tail at (3,3) or something? When snake eats, the head moves to the food cell, and since it grows, a new segment is added at the tail position, but since it was length 1, the tail was the head, so after eating, the head is at the food, and the previous position becomes the tail.\n\nStandard snake: when head eats food, it moves to the food cell, and the tail doesn't move that turn, so snake grows by one cell. So for length 1, after eating at (2,3), head is at (2,3), and the tail is still at (3,3) for now. Then on next turn, when I move, the tail will stay or move depending on direction.\n\nAfter eating, the snake has two segments: head and tail. The tail is at the previous head position.\n\nIn this case, starting at (3,3), move L to (2,3) and eat. New head at (2,3), tail at (3,3). Snake length 2.\n\nDirection: after moving left, head direction is now L.\n\nNow, on next turn, I can move from (2,3).\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R? But current direction L, so cannot move R (right) immediately.\n\nAlso, need to avoid colliding with body. Body is at (3,3), which is to the right.\n\nCells around (2,3):\n\n- U: (2,4)\n\n- D: (2,2)\n\n- L: (1,3)\n\n- R: (3,3) but (3,3) is the tail.\n\nCan I move to (3,3)? The tail is at (3,3), but since the snake moves, when I move the head, the tail will also move forward, so if I move to (3,3), it might cause collision.\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, moving to tail cell is safe because tail moves away.\n\nSimilarly, for body, but here only tail.\n\nSo from (2,3), moving R to (3,3) is safe because tail will move to... where? When head moves to (3,3), since it's eating or not? (3,3) has no food now, I think. Food was at (2,3), which was eaten, so (3,3) is just tail.\n\nWhen head moves to a new cell, if no food, tail moves forward one cell, so the cell that was tail is freed.\n\nIn this case, from (2,3) head, (3,3) tail.\n\nIf I move head to, say, (2,4), then tail moves to (2,3)? Let's think.\n\nPositions: head at (2,3), tail at (3,3).\n\nIf I move head up to (2,4), then new head at (2,4), and tail moves to where? The tail should move to the next segment, but since only two segments, tail moves to the previous head position, which is (2,3). So snake now: head (2,4), tail (2,3).\n\nSimilarly, if I move head to (3,3), which is the current tail position, head moves to (3,3), and since no food, tail moves to... but tail was at (3,3), now head is at (3,3), but tail needs to move. When head moves to the tail cell, since tail was there, but tail moves away, so the cell is free after move.\n\nAfter move, head is at (3,3), and tail is removed? No, the tail moves to the next position, but in a two-segment snake, moving head to the tail cell: head moves to (3,3), which was tail, and tail moves to... since there's no next, it might be that the tail stays or moves.\n\nI think I'm confusing.\n\nStandard snake movement: each turn, the head moves to a new cell, and if no food eaten, the tail moves to the next cell in the body, effectively shifting the snake.\n\nFor a snake of length L, when head moves to a new cell:\n\n- If the cell has food, the snake grows, so tail doesn't move, new length L+1.\n\n- If no food, tail moves one cell towards the head, so the last cell is removed.\n\nIn the case of moving to the tail cell: suppose positions [head, tail] = [A, B].\n\nIf head moves to C (new cell), and C is not food, then new positions: head at C, tail moves to A. So [C, A].\n\nIf head moves to B, which is the current tail.\n\nHead moves to B. Since B is the tail, and no food at B (assuming), then after moving head to B, the tail should move, but to where? The body sequence: after head moves to B, the new head is at B, and the tail, which was at B, but now B is head, so the tail was B, but it needs to move to the next segment. Since only two segments, the tail position is now vacated, and the new tail is the previous head position? Let's see.\n\nBefore move: segments: index 0: head at (2,3), index 1: tail at (3,3)\n\nMove head to (3,3). Since (3,3) is the current tail, and no food there, after moving, head is now at (3,3), and since no food, the tail should be removed or moved. The tail segment is removed, so the new snake has only head at (3,3), length 1.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the snake should shorten only if no food, but here it had length 2, and by moving to tail, it effectively doesn't grow but shortens? I think I have a mistake.\n\nPerhaps in snake games, moving head to the tail cell is allowed and causes no collision because the tail moves away at the same time.\n\nThe rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo in this case, when head moves to tail cell, it is safe, and since no food, the tail moves to the next position, but in a two-segment snake, moving head to tail cell: head moves to (3,3), which was tail, and tail is removed, so snake becomes length 1 at (3,3). But that means the snake shortened, which is incorrect.\n\nI think I have a confusion with the mechanics.\n\nLet me read the rules carefully.\n\n\"Movement Constraints: In each turn you can choose to move 1 cell in directions... No instant reverse.\"\n\n\"Deadly Collisions: Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nAlso, in the food mechanics: \"Special Cases: Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\"\n\nFor movement, when head moves to a cell, if it's the tail, it's not a collision because tail moves.\n\nBut for the snake length, when head moves to a new cell:\n\n- If food, grow: new head position, tail stays, so length +1.\n\n- If no food, no grow: head moves, tail moves one step, so length same.\n\nWhen head moves to the tail cell specifically: suppose head at A, tail at B.\n\nIf head moves to B, and B has no food, then after move, head is at B, and tail was at B, but tail moves to the next segment. Since B was the tail, there is no next segment, so the tail position is vacated, and the new snake has head at B, and no tail, so length 1. But that means the snake shortened, which is not typical.\n\nPerhaps in this implementation, moving to tail is allowed only if it's the only way, but it should not shorten the snake.\n\nI think there's a misunderstanding.\n\nPerhaps \"the tail will also move forward\" means that when the head moves to the tail cell, the tail is moving to a new position at the same time, so for a moment, both are at same cell, but then tail moves, so no collision.\n\nBut in terms of positions, after the move, the head is at the new position, and the tail has moved to where the previous segment was.\n\nFor example, with two segments: [head: (2,3), tail: (3,3)]\n\nMove head to (3,3). Since (3,3) is tail, it is allowed, no collision. After the move, the head is now at (3,3). Since no food eaten, the tail must move. The tail moves to the position that the head just left, which is (2,3). So new positions: head at (3,3), tail at (2,3). So the snake has swapped positions, but length is still 2.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So moving to the tail cell is safe and results in the head and tail swapping if no food.\n\nIf there was food at the tail cell, but food under body can only be eaten if body moves away first, so if tail is on food, and head moves to it, it might not eat if the tail is still there, but in this case, when head moves to the cell, the tail moves away simultaneously, so the food can be eaten only if the cell is free after tail moves.\n\nThe rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nSo for food under body, it can be eaten only when the body is no longer there when head moves in.\n\nBut for tail, when head moves to tail cell, the tail moves away at the same time, so the cell is occupied by head now, and tail left, so if there was food, it might be eaten.\n\nBut in the special case, it says \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nLet's not worry about that for now since snake is short.\n\nBack to current state.\n\nAt turn 0, snake at (3,3), direction L, length 1.\n\nFood at (2,1), (2,3), (3,1).\n\n(2,3) is adjacent left, so moving L to (2,3) will eat the food, since no body, so snake grows to length 2: head at (2,3), tail at (3,3).\n\nDirection now L.\n\nFood at (2,3) is eaten, so removed.\n\nOther food: (2,1) and (3,1).\n\nLife span 10, so plenty of time.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n\nOptions at turn 0:\n\nMove U to (3,4): no food, so snake still length 1 at (3,4), direction U.\n\nThen from there, I can go to other places.\n\nMove D to (3,2): no food, length 1 at (3,2), direction D.\n\nMove L to (2,3): eat food, grow to length 2 at (2,3) with tail at (3,3), direction L.\n\nSince I need to maximize score, eating food is good, but I must avoid risks and think long-term.\n\nWith length 1, eating food is safe, no body to collide with.\n\nIf I move to (2,3), I eat immediately and grow.\n\nIf I move elsewhere, I might eat later.\n\nBut since food has life span, I should eat before they disappear, but 10 turns is long, so no rush.\n\nAlso, the grid is small, 8x8 with walls, so I need to be careful not to trap myself.\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nAssume (0,0) bottom-left, x right, y up.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (5,6) obstacle.\n\nSnake at (3,3).\n\nFood: (2,1), (2,3), (3,1).\n\n(2,3) is at left, same y, x=2.\n\n(3,1) is below, same x, y=1.\n\n(2,1) is at (2,1).\n\nNow, possible moves:\n\n- L to (2,3): eat food, grow to length 2, head (2,3), tail (3,3)\n\n- U to (3,4): no food, head (3,4), tail none, length 1\n\n- D to (3,2): no food, head (3,2), length 1\n\nI cannot move R because of direction L, no reverse.\n\nIf I move U or D, I don't eat, snake remains small, and I can eat later.\n\nBut eating early might be better to grow, but growing too fast might lead to trapping.\n\nWith length 1, it's easy to move.\n\nBut to maximize score, I need to eat multiple food.\n\nLet's think 5 turns ahead.\n\nFirst, if I move L to (2,3) at turn 0, eat food.\n\nThen at turn 1, snake at head (2,3), tail (3,3), direction L.\n\nPossible moves from (2,3):\n\nU to (2,4)\n\nD to (2,2)\n\nL to (1,3)\n\nR to (3,3)  // which is tail, allowed.\n\nNow, food available: (2,1) and (3,1), both at y=1.\n\n(2,1) is at (2,1), which is down from (2,3), so D to (2,2), then D to (2,1).\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) is at (3,1), which can be reached from (2,3) by R to (3,3) or D to (2,2) then R, etc.\n\nSince tail is at (3,3), moving R to (3,3) is safe.\n\nIf I move R to (3,3) at turn 1, no food at (3,3), so after move, head at (3,3), tail at (2,3) because the tail moves to the previous head position.\n\nBefore move: head (2,3), tail (3,3)\n\nMove head to (3,3): since it's tail cell, allowed, no food, so after move, head at (3,3), and tail moves to (2,3). So snake: head (3,3), tail (2,3)\n\nDirection now R.\n\nThen from there, I can move to eat (3,1) or other.\n\nBut (3,1) is below, so D to (3,2), then D to (3,1) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) can be eaten from (2,2) or (2,3).\n\nAlso, after eating at (2,3), the food is gone, so only (2,1) and (3,1) left.\n\nLife span 10, so many turns.\n\nAnother option: from (2,3) at turn 1, I can move D to (2,2), no food, then to (2,1) to eat at turn 2.\n\nOr move L to (1,3), no food, etc.\n\nBut let's consider not eating at turn 0.\n\nIf at turn 0, I move D to (3,2).\n\nThen snake at (3,2), direction D, length 1.\n\nThen I can move to (3,1) to eat, since (3,1) has food.\n\nSo turn 0: move D to (3,2), no food, head at (3,2), direction D.\n\nThen turn 1: move D to (3,1), eat food, grow to length 2: head at (3,1), tail at (3,2).\n\nDirection D.\n\nSimilarly, I can eat (3,1) directly if I move D first.\n\nBut at turn 0, moving D to (3,2) doesn't eat, then turn 1 move D to (3,1) to eat.\n\nIf I move directly to (3,1) from (3,3)? But from (3,3), moving D to (3,2) is one step, not directly to (3,1). I need to move step by step.\n\nFrom (3,3), possible moves: U, D, L.\n\nD to (3,2) is possible.\n\nThen from (3,2), I can go to (3,1) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, I can go to (2,3) to eat (2,3).\n\nOr U to (3,4).\n\nNow, to think long-term, I should consider which food to eat first and how to access others.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (5,6) might affect, but it's far, at (5,6), while food is at bottom-left.\n\n(3,1) and (2,1) are at bottom, y=1, close to wall y=0.\n\ny=0 is wall, so cells with y=0 are invalid.\n\nSimilarly, x=0 left.\n\nFood at (2,1), (3,1), both y=1, so one above y=0.\n\nIf snake is at (3,1), it can move to (3,0) but y=0 is wall, so cannot, or to (2,1), (4,1), (3,2), etc.\n\nBut (4,1) might be free.\n\nNo other food mentioned.\n\nLet's list all cells.\n\nGrid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (5,6).\n\nSo free cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 except (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is occupied, so cannot go there.\n\nNow, food at (2,1), (2,3), (3,1).\n\n(2,3) is at (2,3), which is free.\n\nAt turn 0, if I eat (2,3), I grow and have tail at (3,3).\n\nThen I can go down to eat (2,1) or (3,1).\n\n(2,1) is at (2,1), which is adjacent to wall y=0, but y=0 is wall, so (2,1) is safe to be on, but moving down from there would be to (2,0) which is wall, invalid.\n\nSimilarly for (3,1).\n\nSo if I am at (2,1), I can only move U, L, R, not D.\n\nSimilarly for (3,1).\n\nAlso, (2,1) and (3,1) are close, I can eat both.\n\nFor example, after eating (2,3), at turn 1, I can move D to (2,2), no food, then turn 2 move D to (2,1) to eat.\n\nAt turn 2, eat (2,1), grow to length 3.\n\nPositions: before move, head at (2,2), tail at (3,3)? Let's sequence.\n\nTurn 0: start head (3,3), move L to (2,3), eat, so after turn 0, head (2,3), tail (3,3), length 2.\n\nTurn 1: move D to (2,2), no food at (2,2), so head moves to (2,2), tail moves to (2,3)? Tail was at (3,3), but when head moves, tail moves to the previous head position.\n\nBefore turn 1: head at (2,3), tail at (3,3)\n\nMove head to (2,2) (down), no food, so new head at (2,2), tail moves to (2,3). So now snake: head (2,2), tail (2,3)\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen turn 2: move D to (2,1), which has food, eat, so head moves to (2,1), tail stays at (2,3) because of growth. New segment added, so positions: head (2,1), and body (2,2), tail (2,3)? When eating, tail doesn't move.\n\nAfter eating at (2,1), head at (2,1), and the previous positions are all there, so snake: head (2,1), then (2,2), then (2,3)? Let's list segments.\n\nAfter turn 1: segments [ (2,2), (2,3) ] with head at (2,2), tail at (2,3)\n\nTurn 2: move head to (2,1), which has food, so eat, grow: head moves to (2,1), tail does not move, so new segments: head (2,1), then previous head (2,2), then tail (2,3). So body: (2,1) head, (2,2) body, (2,3) tail. Length 3.\n\nDirection D.\n\nNow, I can eat (3,1) from here.\n\nFrom (2,1), I can move R to (3,1), which has food.\n\nMove to (3,1), eat, grow.\n\nThen snake grows to length 4, head at (3,1), with body (2,1), (2,2), tail (2,3).\n\nThen from there, I can move up or left, etc.\n\nBut I need to think about the tail reward danger, but for now, no issue.\n\nIf at turn 0, I eat (3,1) first.\n\nTurn 0: move D to (3,2), no food (assuming no food at (3,2)), head at (3,2), direction D, length 1.\n\nTurn 1: move D to (3,1), eat food, grow to length 2: head (3,1), tail (3,2).\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen I can go to (2,1) or (2,3) or other.\n\n(2,1) is adjacent left, so move L to (2,1), eat, grow to length 3.\n\nThen I have (2,1) head, (3,1) body, (3,2) tail.\n\nThen I can go to (2,3) by moving U to (2,2), then U to (2,3), but (2,3) has food, so eat at (2,3).\n\nBut at turn 0, if I didn't eat (2,3), it might disappear later, but life span 10, so if I eat (3,1) at turn 1, then (2,1) at turn 2, then to (2,3) I need to go to (2,2) first.\n\nFrom (2,1), after eating, head at (2,1), body at (3,1), tail at (3,2).\n\nMove U to (2,2), no food, so head to (2,2), tail to (2,1)? Before move: head (2,1), body (3,1), tail (3,2)\n\nMove head to (2,2), no food, so new head (2,2), body: the segment at (2,1) becomes body, and tail moves to (3,1)? When head moves to new cell, the body shifts.\n\nSegments: index 0 head at (2,1), index 1 at (3,1), index 2 tail at (3,2)\n\nMove head to (2,2), no food, so new head at (2,2), then the body: index 1 moves to previous head position (2,1), and tail moves to previous index 1 position (3,1). So new segments: head (2,2), body (2,1), tail (3,1)\n\nTail at (3,1), not (3,2).\n\nThen from (2,2), I can move U to (2,3), which has food, eat, so grow: head to (2,3), tail stays at (3,1), so new segments: head (2,3), then (2,2), (2,1), tail (3,1)? After eating, tail doesn't move, so segments: head (2,3), then previous (2,2), (2,1), and tail (3,1), but (2,1) and (3,1) are not connected properly, but in terms of positions, it's fine, the snake can be non-contiguous in position list but connected by adjacency.\n\nThe positions are listed in order, so after move to (2,3) with food, segments: head (2,3), then the previous head (2,2), then the body (2,1), then tail (3,1). But (2,2) to (2,1) is adjacent, (2,1) to (3,1) is adjacent, so ok.\n\nLength 4.\n\nBut I ate all three food quickly.\n\nIn both cases, I can eat all food by turn 2 or 3.\n\nBut I need to think 5+ turns ahead for survival.\n\nAfter eating all, I have a longer snake, and I need to find more food, but there is no more food, only these three.\n\nFood positions are given, so only these three for now, but new food might spawn? The state doesn't say anything about new food spawning. Only the given food.\n\n\"Food Positions, Value and Life Span\" are given, so only these exist. No mention of new food, so I need to eat these before they disappear.\n\nLife span 10, so I have time, but I should eat them.\n\nAlso, after eating all, with length 4, I need to survive, but with no food, I can just move around without eating, but the goal is to maximize score, so I need to eat positive food, but if no food, I don't eat, score doesn't increase.\n\nBut to survive, I can move safely.\n\nBut on a small grid, with walls, it might be risky.\n\nGrid has 6x6 free cells minus obstacle, so 36 -1 =35 cells, but with walls around.\n\nx from 1 to 6, y from 1 to6, that's 6x6=36 cells, minus (5,6) obstacle, so 35 free cells.\n\nWith snake length 4, I can move around.\n\nBut to maximize score, I need to eat all positive food available.\n\nThere are three, all +1.\n\nSo best to eat all three.\n\nNow, at turn 0, I can choose to eat (2,3) or go for (3,1) or other.\n\nBut if I eat (2,3) first, as above, I can eat (2,1) and (3,1) quickly.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat (3,1) first, I can eat others.\n\nBut let's see the tail reward danger for later.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (5,6) is not near, so for now, no issue.\n\nAnother thing: if I don't eat at turn 0, I might be able to eat multiple in a sequence without growing too fast in a corner.\n\nBut with length 1, it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid eating immediately to have more flexibility.\n\nBut since I need to eat eventually, and food might disappear, but with 10 turns, I can eat all.\n\nLife span 10, so if I wait, food might disappear, but I have time.\n\nFor example, if I move U to (3,4) at turn 0, no eat, then I can go to other areas, but there is no other food, only these three at bottom-left.\n\nSo I need to come back to eat them.\n\nMoving away might waste turns.\n\nFor instance, turn 0 move U to (3,4), head (3,4), length 1.\n\nThen I can move to (2,3) to eat, but (2,3) is at (2,3), which is adjacent, so turn 1 move L to (2,3)? From (3,4), to (2,3) is left and down, but I can only move one cell at a time.\n\nFrom (3,4), possible moves: U to (3,5), D to (3,3), L to (2,4), R to (4,4), but current direction after move to (3,4) is U, so I can move U, D, L, R? After moving U, direction is U, so cannot move D (down) immediately, no reverse.\n\nTurn 0: from (3,3) move U to (3,4), direction U.\n\nTurn 1: from (3,4), direction U, so possible moves: U to (3,5), L to (2,4), R to (4,4), but not D (down) because reverse.\n\n(2,3) is at (2,3), which is not adjacent to (3,4); adjacent cells are (3,5), (3,3), (2,4), (4,4).\n\n(2,3) is below and left, not directly adjacent.\n\nTo reach (2,3) from (3,4), I need to move, say, L to (2,4) then D to (2,3), or D to (3,3) then L to (2,3), but (3,3) might be occupied if snake was there, but in this case, when I moved to (3,4), the tail is gone since length 1, so (3,3) is free.\n\nTurn 0: start (3,3), move U to (3,4), no eat, so snake now at (3,4), length 1, no tail.\n\n(3,3) is empty.\n\nTurn 1: from (3,4), direction U, can move U, L, R.\n\nIf move L to (2,4), no food.\n\nThen turn 2: from (2,4), can move to (2,3) D, since direction L? After moving L, direction L, so can move D, U, L.\n\nMove D to (2,3), which has food, eat.\n\nSo at turn 2, eat (2,3), whereas if I ate at turn 0, I would have eaten earlier.\n\nSimilarly, to eat (3,1), it would take more turns.\n\nSo it's better to eat early to have the length increase earlier, but since no time pressure, it might not matter, but for score, eating sooner is fine.\n\nBut with longer snake, it might be harder to move in tight spaces.\n\nIn this area, with y=1, it might be tight.\n\nFor example, after eating all three, snake length 4, at positions like (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1) or something, which is in the corner, might be hard to get out.\n\nBut I can move up.\n\nFor instance, from (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), head at (3,1) say, then I can move to (3,2) or (4,1), etc.\n\nNot stuck.\n\nBut let's plan a sequence that allows me to eat all and have a path to open area.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns, I should outline a plan.\n\nAlso, for the answer, I need to output actions for several turns, but the format is to output actions from turn t1 onwards for multiple turns, but it doesn't specify how many, but since think 5+ turns, I should provide at least 5 actions.\n\nThe answer format: \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nAnd \"think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should provide a sequence of actions for multiple turns, say 5 or more.\n\nBut the state is at turn 0, so I need to give actions for turn 0,1,2,3,4, etc.\n\nBut the game continues, so I need to plan a strategy.\n\nPerhaps for the output, I can provide a sequence that eats the food and then moves safely.\n\nBut since no more food, after eating all, I just need to survive as long as possible without eating negative food, but there is no negative food mentioned, only positive, so I can move forever if I avoid walls and body, but with a long snake, it might self-collide.\n\nTo maximize score, since no more food, score is fixed after eating all, so I need to eat all three as soon as possible to have the score, then survive.\n\nBut surviving with no food means no score increase, but I don't die, so I can keep moving.\n\nThe score is based on food eaten, so once all food is eaten, score is max, and I just need to not die.\n\nBut to avoid risks, I should stay in open areas.\n\nBut for now, at turn 0, I should start eating.\n\nLet's choose to eat (2,3) first at turn 0.\n\nSo turn 0: move L to (2,3), eat, grow to length 2, head (2,3), tail (3,3)\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen turn 1: I need to go to eat (2,1) or (3,1).\n\n(2,1) is directly below, so move D to (2,2), no food, so head to (2,2), tail to (2,3)  // since tail moves to previous head position\n\nAfter move: head (2,2), tail (2,3)\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen turn 2: move D to (2,1), eat food, grow to length 3: head (2,1), body (2,2), tail (2,3)\n\nDirection D.\n\nNow, I have (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) vertical at x=2.\n\nThen I can go to eat (3,1).\n\nFrom (2,1), I can move R to (3,1), which has food.\n\nMove to (3,1), eat, grow to length 4: head (3,1), then body (2,1), (2,2), tail (2,3)\n\nDirection R (since moved right).\n\nNow, all food eaten by turn 3.\n\nThen from here, I need to move to open area.\n\nFor example, from (3,1), I can move U to (3,2), no food, so head to (3,2), tail to (3,1)? Before move: head (3,1), body (2,1), (2,2), tail (2,3)\n\nMove head to (3,2), no food, so new head (3,2), then body: the segment at (3,1) is new body, but (3,1) was head, now it's body, and the first body segment (2,1) moves to? When head moves to (3,2), the body shifts: the new head is (3,2), then the previous head (3,1) becomes the first body segment, then (2,1) becomes second body, and tail moves to (2,2) or something.\n\nPositions: before move: index 0: head (3,1), index 1: (2,1), index 2: (2,2), index 3: tail (2,3)\n\nMove head to (3,2), no food, so new head at (3,2), then index 1 moves to previous head position (3,1), index 2 moves to previous index 1 position (2,1), tail moves to previous index 2 position (2,2). So new segments: head (3,2), body (3,1), (2,1), tail (2,2)\n\n(2,2) is tail.\n\nThen from (3,2), I can move U to (3,3), but (3,3) might be free or not, but in this case, (3,3) was earlier position, but now free.\n\n(3,3) is free, so move U to (3,3), no food, head to (3,3), tail to (3,2)? Before move: head (3,2), body (3,1), (2,1), tail (2,2)\n\nMove head to (3,3), no food, new head (3,3), then body: (3,2) from previous head, then (3,1) from previous body, then tail to (2,1) from previous body? Segments: new head (3,3), then previous head (3,2), then previous index 1 (3,1), tail at previous index 2 (2,1)? Indexing: after previous move, indices: 0: (3,2), 1: (3,1), 2: (2,1), 3: (2,2) tail\n\nMove head to (3,3), no food, so new head (3,3), then segment 1 moves to (3,2), segment 2 moves to (3,1), tail moves to (2,1). So new: head (3,3), body (3,2), (3,1), tail (2,1)\n\nThen I can continue moving to (3,4) or other.\n\nBut this is just moving.\n\nSince no food, I can keep moving safely.\n\nBut for the plan, I need to output actions for several turns.\n\nAt turn 0, I move L to eat (2,3).\n\nThen turn 1, move D to (2,2)\n\nTurn 2, move D to (2,1) eat\n\nThen turn 3, move R to (3,1) eat\n\nThen turn 4, move U to (3,2)\n\nTurn 5, move U to (3,3)\n\nEtc.\n\nBut at turn 3, after moving to (3,1) and eating, the positions are head (3,1), body (2,1), (2,2), tail (2,3)\n\nThen move U to (3,2) at turn 4, as above.\n\nI could from turn 1, after eating (2,3), go directly to (3,1).\n\nAt turn 1, from (2,3), I can move R to (3,3), which is the tail.\n\nMove to (3,3), no food, so after move, head at (3,3), tail at (2,3)  // swapped\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen from (3,3), I can move D to (3,2), no food, then to (3,1) to eat at turn 3.\n\nBut slower to eat (3,1).\n\nBetter to eat (2,1) first as I did.\n\nAnother option: at turn 0, move D to (3,2), no eat.\n\nThen turn 1 move D to (3,1) eat, grow to length 2, head (3,1), tail (3,2)\n\nThen turn 2 move L to (2,1) eat, grow to length 3, head (2,1), body (3,1), tail (3,2)\n\nThen turn 3 move U to (2,2), no food, head (2,2), tail to (2,1)? Before: head (2,1), body (3,1), tail (3,2)\n\nMove head to (2,2), no food, new head (2,2), body: (2,1) from previous head, tail to (3,1) from previous body.\n\nNew: head (2,2), body (2,1), tail (3,1)\n\nThen turn 4 move U to (2,3) eat, grow to length 4, head (2,3), body (2,2), (2,1), tail (3,1)\n\nSimilar to before.\n\nBy turn 4, all eaten.\n\nIn the first sequence, I ate all by turn 3.\n\nFirst sequence: turn 0 eat (2,3), turn 2 eat (2,1), turn 3 eat (3,1)\n\nAt turn 1 I moved to (2,2), no eat.\n\nSo eaten at turn 0,2,3.\n\nSecond sequence: eat at turn 1,2,4.\n\nSlightly later.\n\nSo better to eat (2,3) first.\n\nBut at turn 0, if I move L to (2,3), I eat immediately.\n\nNow, about the tail reward danger: it says if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n\nBut in this case, with short snake, not an issue.\n\nFor example, when I have length 2, head and tail adjacent only if I move towards tail, but tail moves, so usually not adjacent except when I move to it.\n\nBut the danger is when tail has food under it, and head eats it.\n\nBut in this state, no food under body, so safe.\n\nSo I think moving L at turn 0 is fine.\n\nThen for the sequence, I can provide:\n\nTurn 0: L  // eat (2,3)\n\nThen turn 1: D  // to (2,2)\n\nTurn 2: D  // to (2,1) eat\n\nThen turn 3: R  // to (3,1) eat\n\nThen turn 4: U  // to (3,2)\n\nTurn 5: U  // to (3,3)\n\nBut at turn 4, from (3,1) after eating, head at (3,1), with body (2,1), (2,2), tail (2,3)\n\nMove U to (3,2), as above.\n\nThen from (3,2), I can move U to (3,3) at turn 5.\n\n(3,3) is free.\n\nThen from (3,3), I can move to other directions.\n\nBut since no food, it's fine.\n\nTo think ahead, after turn 5, I can move to (3,4) or (4,3), etc.\n\nBut for the output, I need to specify multiple turns.\n\nThe format says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so for the action decision, I need to consider future, but for output, I can provide a sequence.\n\nPerhaps for turn 0, I decide to move L, then for subsequent turns, I need to plan.\n\nBut in the answer, I should provide the actions.\n\nSince the state might change, but here only the snake moves, food countdown decreases, but no new food, so I can plan the sequence.\n\nFood life span decreases, but all have 10, so by turn 10, they disappear, but I eat by turn 3, so fine.\n\nNow, another thing: the internal obstacle at (5,6), but it's not relevant for now.\n\nAlso, walls.\n\nSo I think the sequence is good.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nAt turn 0: move L to (2,3), eat.\n\nAfter that, at turn 1, from (2,3), direction L, I move D to (2,2).\n\nIs D allowed? Current direction is L, moving down is not opposite, opposite would be R. So U, D, L are allowed.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 2, from (2,2), direction D, move D to (2,1), eat.\n\nThen turn 3, from (2,1), direction D, move R to (3,1), which is right, not opposite to D? D is down, R is right, not opposite, so allowed. Opposite of D is U.\n\nSo move R to (3,1), eat.\n\nThen turn 4, from (3,1), direction R, move U to (3,2), not opposite, allowed.\n\nThen turn 5, from (3,2), direction U, move U to (3,3), allowed.\n\nAt (3,3), it was previously occupied, but now free.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut for the output, since \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide at least 5 actions, from turn 0 to turn 4 or 5.\n\nTurn t1=0, so actions for turn 0,1,2,3,4,5.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 0 to 5.\n\nNow, to be safe, after eating, I should move to the center to avoid being trapped.\n\nBut for now, this is fine.\n\nI could have eaten (3,1) first.\n\nBut similar.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 0, if I move D to (3,2), no eat, then I can move to (3,1) or (2,3), but (2,3) is not adjacent directly.\n\nFrom (3,2), I can move to (2,2) or (4,2), etc., but to eat (2,3), I need to go to (2,2) or (2,3) directly if possible, but not adjacent.\n\nFrom (3,2), possible moves: U to (3,3), D to (3,1) eat, L to (2,2), R to (4,2), etc.\n\nSo to eat (2,3), I need to go to (2,2) first, then to (2,3).\n\nBut it takes more turns.\n\nSimilarly, eating (2,1) from there.\n\nSo less efficient.\n\nThus, best to eat the adjacent food at turn 0.\n\nSo I think move L at turn 0.\n\nThen the sequence as above.\n\nFor the answer, I'll provide turns 0 to 5.\n\nBut at turn 5, I move to (3,3), which is fine.\n\nTo make it 6 turns or so.\n\nSince all food eaten by turn 3, turns 4 and 5 are just moving.\n\nBut I need to output the actions.\n\nAlso, in the sequence, when I move at turn 1 to (2,2), no food, so no issue.\n\nNow, about the life span: at turn 0, food at (2,3) has life span 10, so after turn 0, it decreases to 9, but since eaten, gone.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut I eat all before they expire.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nI think this is good.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score, the AI must eat all three positive food items (+1 each) while ensuring long-term survival. Given the current state at turn \\(t_1 = 0\\), the snake starts at (3,3) with direction left (L). The food positions are (2,1), (2,3), and (3,1), all with a life span of 10 turns, so they must be eaten within 10 turns. The grid has walls at the borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and an internal obstacle at (5,6), but these do not immediately threaten the snake in the early turns.\n\n### Key Considerations for 5+ Turn Planning\n- **Immediate opportunity**: At turn 0, moving left (L) to (2,3) eats the food there, growing the snake to length 2. This is efficient as (2,3) is adjacent and avoids wasting turns.\n- **Subsequent food targets**: After eating (2,3), the snake should prioritize eating (2,1) and (3,1) next, as they are close and have limited life spans. Moving down twice (to (2,2) then (2,1)) eats (2,1) by turn 2. Then, moving right to (3,1) eats the last food by turn 3.\n- **Long-term survival**: After all food is eaten (by turn 3), the snake must avoid dead ends and move toward open areas (e.g., center of the grid) to prevent trapping itself. From turn 4 onward, moving up to (3,2), (3,3), and then (3,4) keeps the snake safe and away from walls.\n- **Risk avoidance**: \n  - No negative food is present, so only positive food benefits the score.\n  - With the snake starting at length 1, body collisions are impossible until after growth. After growth, movements are planned to avoid the tail and body (e.g., moving to the tail cell is safe as the tail moves away).\n  - The internal obstacle at (5,6) is distant and does not affect the early plan. Later movements steer clear of it.\n- **Direction constraints**: The initial direction is L, so reverse moves (R) are forbidden on turn 1. All subsequent moves respect the no-instant-reverse rule.\n- **Food life span**: All food has a 10-turn life span. Eating all by turn 3 is well within this limit (food disappears after turn 9 if not eaten).\n- **Score maximization**: Eating all three food items by turn 3 maximizes the score to +3. After that, survival maintains this score.\n\n### Planned Actions (Turns 0 to 5)\nThe sequence below eats all food efficiently by turn 3 and then moves to safer, open areas for long-term survival. Actions are chosen to minimize risk and avoid dead ends:\n\n- **Turn 0 (current turn)**: Move L to (2,3). This eats the food at (2,3), growing the snake to length 2. New head position: (2,3), tail at (3,3). Head direction is now L.  \n  (Food eaten: (2,3); score: +1)\n\n- **Turn 1**: Move D to (2,2). No food here, so the snake moves but does not grow. Head moves to (2,2), tail moves to (2,3). Head direction is now D.  \n  (No food; score unchanged)\n\n- **Turn 2**: Move D to (2,1). This eats the food at (2,1), growing the snake to length 3. Head moves to (2,1), with body segments at (2,2) and tail at (2,3). Head direction is now D.  \n  (Food eaten: (2,1); score: +2)\n\n- **Turn 3**: Move R to (3,1). This eats the food at (3,1), growing the snake to length 4. Head moves to (3,1), with body segments at (2,1), (2,2), and tail at (2,3). Head direction is now R.  \n  (Food eaten: (3,1); score: +3; all food consumed)\n\n- **Turn 4**: Move U to (3,2). No food, so the snake moves without growing. Head moves to (3,2), tail moves to (2,2) (body shifts). Head direction is now U. This moves the snake away from the bottom wall (y=0) toward safer areas.  \n  (No food; score unchanged)\n\n- **Turn 5**: Move U to (3,3). No food, so the snake moves without growing. Head moves to (3,3), tail moves to (3,1) (body shifts). Head direction is now U. This centralizes the snake, reducing collision risk and preparing for future movement.  \n  (No food; score unchanged)\n\n### Beyond Turn 5\n- **Long-term strategy (turns 6+)**: With all food eaten and no new food, the priority is survival. Move toward open areas (e.g., (3,4), (4,4), etc.) to avoid walls and self-collision. Since the grid has 35 free cells and the snake is length 4, there is ample space. Avoid the obstacle at (5,6) and borders. If new food spawns (not in current state), reevaluate to eat it if safe.\n- **Risk assessment**: By turn 5, the snake is at (3,3) with direction U, in a flexible position. Future moves can include U to (3,4), R to (4,3), or L to (2,3) if safe, always avoiding reverse moves. The path avoids corners (e.g., (2,1) or (3,1)) where the snake could be trapped.\n\nThis plan eats all food by turn 3 for maximum score (+3) and ensures survival for at least 5+ turns by moving to less constrained areas.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: L\nTurn 1: D\nTurn 2: D\nTurn 3: R\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\n}",

Internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nSnake positions: head at (2,3), body at (3,3). So the snake is two segments long, moving left.

So current head direction is left, meaning it came from the right.\n\nNow, food positions:\n\n- (2,1) with value 1, life span 9? Food format is (x, y, value, life_span).

Looking back:\n\n\"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" but in the current state, it's listed as (2,1,9,1) etc. I think there's inconsistency.\n\nIn the core rules, it says: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\"\n\nBut in the current state, it's: \"- (2, 1, 9, 1)\" which might be shorthand for ( (2,1), 9, 1 ) or ( (2,1), 1, 9 )?\n\nThe text says: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value\" in the state, but in core rules it's \"Value and Life Span\". Let's clarify.\n\nCore rules: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\"\n\nCurrent state: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (2, 1, 9, 1)\" – this is messy.\n\nProbably, it's a tuple: (x,y, value, life_span) or (x,y, life_span, value)? The state says \"Life Span and Value\" but lists numbers.\n\nLook: \"- (2, 1, 9, 1)\" and it says \"Life Span and Value\", so likely (x,y, life_span, value) or (x,y, value, life_span)? In the description, it says \"value1, life_span1\", so value first.\n\nI think it's a mistake in the state input. In core rules, it's ( (x,y), value, life_span )\n\nBut in state, it's written as (2,1,9,1), which might mean x=2,y=1, value=9, life_span=1? Or value=1, life_span=9?\n\nThe text: \"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (2, 1, 9, 1)\" – it says \"Life Span and Value\" but then the numbers. Also, values should be +1 or -1 for food, but here it's 9 and 1, which are likely life_span and value.\n\nAssume that for (2,1,9,1), it means position (2,1), value=1, life_span=9? Or value=9, life_span=1? But value should be +1 or -1, I think.\n\nCore rules: Positive food has value +1, negative has -1. Here, for (2,1,9,1), if it's (x,y, life_span, value), then value=1, which is +1. Similarly, (3,1,9,1) value=1, and (1,1,10,1) value=1. All seem positive food with value +1.\n\nLife_span: for (2,1) life_span=9, (3,1) life_span=9, (1,1) life_span=10.\n\nAnd current turn t1=1.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for turns 1,2,3,4,5,... up to 5+ turns ahead, but the answer should start from turn 1 action.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid.\n\nGrid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nSnake: head at (2,3), body at (3,3). Moving left, so from (3,3) to (2,3). Current direction L.\n\nFood at:\n\n- (2,1): value +1, life_span 9\n\n- (3,1): value +1, life_span 9\n\n- (1,1): value +1, life_span 10\n\nAll positive food, all at y=1, x=1,2,3.\n\nSnake is at (2,3) and (3,3), so head at (2,3). To reach food, it needs to go down to y=1.\n\nBut there are walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 is safe.\n\nNow, possible moves from (2,3): since moving left, cannot instantly reverse to right, so cannot go R. Possible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), but L is current direction? No, current head direction is L, meaning it's facing left.\n\nMovement constraints: can choose U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse. Since current direction is L, I cannot move R (right) on next turn.\n\nAvailable moves: U, D, L.\n\nNow, positions:\n\n- U: (2,4)\n\n- D: (2,2)\n\n- L: (1,3)\n\nNow, check for collisions or walls.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So (2,4): x=2 not 0 or 7, y=4 not 0 or 7, so ok. (2,2): similarly ok. (1,3): x=1, y=3, not wall.\n\nInternal obstacle: (5,6), not relevant here.\n\nNow, body collision: snake body is at (3,3). After move, the body will move. When snake moves, the head moves to new position, and each segment follows, so tail moves away.\n\nAt turn start, positions: head (2,3), body (3,3).\n\nAfter move, say to (2,4), then new head (2,4), body moves to (2,3). So the cell (3,3) is vacated.\n\nSimilarly for other moves.\n\nCollision: head cannot touch body except for the tail in some cases, but generally, after move, if head is on a cell with body, it dies, except if it's the tail and the tail moves away, but since head moves first, if head moves to where tail is, and tail moves, it might be ok if done right.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, if head moves to the current tail position, it should be ok, because tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, snake has only two segments: head and tail. Tail is at (3,3).\n\nIf I move right, but I cannot, because no instant reverse.\n\nAvailable moves: U, D, L.\n\nIf I move to (1,3), which is left of (2,3), that's fine, but (1,3) is not occupied by body currently; body is at (3,3), so no issue.\n\nIf I move to (2,2) or (2,4), also not occupied.\n\nSo all moves are safe for now.\n\nBut I need to think about eating food.\n\nFood at (2,1), (3,1), (1,1).\n\nAll at y=1, while snake head at y=3.\n\nTo eat, I need to go down.\n\nFood life spans: all have life_span 9 or 10, current turn 1, so they disappear after turn 9 or 10? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for food at (2,1) with life_span 9, at turn 1, it has 9 turns left, including turn 1, so it will disappear after turn 9, meaning on turn 10 it's gone? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" and \"disappears after N turns\".\n\nSo at turn t, if life_span is L, it decreases by 1 each turn, and when it reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nFor example, at turn 1, life_span=9, after turn 1, it becomes 8 (if we think after state), but the countdown decreases at the start or end of turn?\n\nTypically, it decreases at the end of the turn.\n\nBut the rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nAnd \"disappears after N turns\".\n\nI think: when food is spawned, it has life_span N. On each turn, including the turn it was spawned, the countdown decreases by 1. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or something.\n\nTo simplify: at the beginning of turn t, if life_span counter is k, after the turn, it becomes k-1. When it becomes 0, the food disappears before the next turn.\n\nBut for eating, if head moves to food cell during the turn, it eats it.\n\nFor food at (2,1) with life_span 9 at turn 1, it will be there until after turn 9, I think. Since it decreases each turn, after 9 decreases, it should be gone at turn 10.\n\nLet's not overcomplicate; all food has high life span, 9 or 10, so for the next few turns, they are all present. Since we're planning 5+ turns, we can assume they are there.\n\nNow, snake head at (2,3). To reach y=1, I need to go down twice: to (2,2) then to (2,1), or via other paths.\n\nBut there is food at (2,1), (3,1), (1,1).\n\nAlso, (3,1) is below the body? Body at (3,3), but after moves.\n\nFirst, I need to choose action for turn 1.\n\nOptions:\n\n- U: to (2,4)\n\n- D: to (2,2)\n\n- L: to (1,3)\n\nIf I go U to (2,4), I'm moving away from food, which is at y=1, so that might not be good for short term gain.\n\nD to (2,2) gets me closer to (2,1).\n\nL to (1,3) gets me closer to (1,1).\n\nBut (1,1) has life_span 10, so longer, but all are similar.\n\nSince snake is short, eating any food is good, but I need to avoid risks.\n\nAlso, there is a danger with tail reward.\n\nFirst, let's see if I can go directly to food.\n\nFor example, if I go D to (2,2) on turn 1.\n\nThen head to (2,2), body moves to (2,3), so snake at [(2,2), (2,3)]\n\nDirection: since moved down, new direction D.\n\nThen on turn 2, from (2,2), I can go D to (2,1), which has food, so I eat it, length increases to 3.\n\nBut check tail reward danger: when I eat at (2,1), head moves to (2,1), eats food, so new segment grows, so snake becomes [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3)]? No.\n\nWhen you eat food, the growth happens after the move, so after moving to food, the snake grows, so tail doesn't move that turn.\n\nStandard snake: when head moves to food, it eats, and the tail doesn't move, so length increases by one.\n\nIn this case: turn 1: move to (2,2), no food, so snake to [(2,2), (2,3)]? After move: head to new position, body follows, so from [(2,3),(3,3)] move D to (2,2), then head (2,2), body from (2,3) to where head was, but since only two segments, new positions: head (2,2), body (2,3). Tail was (3,3), but moved to (2,3).\n\nInitial: positions [(2,3), (3,3)]\n\nAfter move D: head to (2,2), then body moves to previous head position (2,3), so new snake: [(2,2), (2,3)]\n\nNo food eaten at (2,2), so no growth.\n\nThen turn 2: from (2,2), move D to (2,1). (2,1) has food, so head moves to (2,1), eats food, and since food eaten, tail does not move, so snake grows: new head (2,1), and body segments remain, so snake becomes [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3)]? Positions: before move, snake is at [(2,2), (2,3)]\n\nHead moves to (2,1), which has food, so after move, head is at (2,1), and because food eaten, a new segment is added at the tail, so tail stays, so positions: head (2,1), then previous head (2,2) becomes body, and tail (2,3) remains, so [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3)]\n\nLength 3.\n\nNow, is there tail reward danger? Tail reward danger is when head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, but in this case, when eating at (2,1), the tail is at (2,3), which is not adjacent; (2,3) is two away, not adjacent.\n\nAdjacent means sharing a side, so (2,1) and (2,3) are not adjacent; (2,2) is in between.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nSimilarly, if I go L to (1,3) first.\n\nTurn 1: move L to (1,3), no food there, so snake to [(1,3), (2,3)]\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen turn 2: from (1,3), can move D to (1,2) or L to (0,3) but x=0 is wall, so cannot L, or U to (1,4), D to (1,2).\n\n(1,2) no food, then to (1,1) on turn 3.\n\nBut (1,1) has food, life_span 10, so can eat on turn 3.\n\nSimilarly, if I go U first, to (2,4), then I'm farther, might not get food soon.\n\nSo going down seems better for immediate food.\n\nBut there is also food at (3,1).\n\nIf I go to (2,2) on turn 1, then on turn 2, instead of D to (2,1), I could go R to (3,2), but current direction after turn 1 is D, so on turn 2, from (2,2), direction D, I can move U, D, L, R except reverse, which is U? Reverse would be opposite to current direction.\n\nCurrent direction after move: after moving down to (2,2), direction is down.\n\nSo for turn 2, I cannot move up (U), because that would be reverse.\n\nAvailable: L, R, D.\n\nD to (2,1), L to (1,2), R to (3,2).\n\nIf I go R to (3,2), then to (3,1) on next turn.\n\nBut (3,1) has food.\n\nBut if I go directly to (2,1) on turn 2, I eat sooner.\n\nFrom (2,2), going to (2,1) eats on turn 2, whereas going to (3,2) then to (3,1) eats on turn 3.\n\nSimilarly, from start, if I go L to (1,3), then to (1,2) turn 2, then to (1,1) turn 3.\n\nSo quickest is to go down to (2,2) turn 1, then down to (2,1) turn 2 to eat.\n\nEat on turn 2.\n\nIf I go down turn 1 to (2,2), then on turn 2 I eat at (2,1).\n\nBut is there a reason not to?\n\nI need to think long-term.\n\nAfter eating, snake becomes length 3 at positions, say, [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3)] if I eat at (2,1).\n\nThen I need to move from there.\n\nAvailable moves from (2,1): U, D, L, R.\n\nBut D to (2,0) is wall, y=0 is wall, so cannot go D.\n\nL to (1,1), which has food? (1,1) has food, but let's see.\n\nAfter eating, head at (2,1), direction down? Since I moved down to (2,1).\n\nAfter moving down to (2,1), direction is down.\n\nNow, from (2,1), I cannot go down because y=0 wall.\n\nCan go U (up), L (left), R (right).\n\nU to (2,2), but (2,2) is part of body? Current snake: [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3)]\n\nSo (2,2) is body segment, so if I go U to (2,2), head moves to body, collision, death.\n\nCannot go U.\n\nL to (1,1): (1,1) has food, so possible.\n\nR to (3,1): (3,1) has food, also possible.\n\n(1,1) and (3,1) both have food.\n\nIf I go L to (1,1), I eat it, then snake grows to length 4.\n\nSimilarly, if R to (3,1).\n\nBut after eating at (2,1), the tail is at (2,3).\n\n(1,1) is adjacent to? (1,1) and tail (2,3) are not adjacent; positions: (1,1) and (2,3) are not sharing side; distance is |dx|=1, |dy|=2, not adjacent.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) and (2,3) not adjacent.\n\nSo no tail reward danger.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nFrom (2,1), if I go L to (1,1), I eat, then snake becomes [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)]\n\nHead at (1,1), direction left.\n\nThen from there, I need to move. Possible moves: U to (1,2), D to (1,0) but y=0 wall, cannot. L to (0,1) but x=0 wall, cannot. R to (2,1) but (2,1) is body, collision.\n\nSo only possible move is U to (1,2).\n\n(1,2) is empty, I assume.\n\nThen move to (1,2), no food, so snake moves: head to (1,2), body follows, tail moves away, so snake to [(1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2)]? Positions: before move, [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)]\n\nHead moves to (1,2), no food, so tail moves: head to (1,2), then (1,1) becomes new body, (2,1) body, (2,2) body, and tail (2,3) is removed? No.\n\nSnake movement: when no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the previous position of the next segment.\n\nEasier: the body segments shift, tail is removed.\n\nSo from positions: head (1,1), then body (2,1), then (2,2), then tail (2,3)\n\nAfter move to (1,2): new head (1,2), then the first body segment moves to previous head position (1,1), second body to (2,1), tail to (2,2), and (2,3) vacated.\n\nSo new snake: [(1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2)]\n\nLength 4.\n\nThen from (1,2), I can move U, D, L, R.\n\nD to (1,1) but (1,1) is now body, collision.\n\nL to (0,2) x=0 wall, cannot.\n\nR to (2,2) which is body, collision.\n\nU to (1,3), which might be free.\n\n(1,3) was part of initial snake, but after moves, it should be free now.\n\nInitially snake at (2,3) and (3,3), then moved to (2,2) and (2,3), then to (2,1) and (2,2) and (2,3), then to (1,1) and (2,1) and (2,2) and (2,3), then to (1,2) and (1,1) and (2,1) and (2,2).\n\nSo (1,3) is free.\n\nSo from (1,2), only move is U to (1,3).\n\nThen to (1,3), and so on.\n\nBut this seems a bit trapped; I have few moves.\n\nIf after eating at (2,1), I go R to (3,1) instead of L.\n\nTurn 2: after turn 1 move to (2,2), turn 2 move to (2,1) eat, snake [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3)]\n\nTurn 3: from (2,1), move R to (3,1), eat food at (3,1), so grow, snake becomes [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)]\n\nHead at (3,1), direction right.\n\nThen from (3,1), moves: U to (3,2), D to (3,0) wall, cannot; L to (2,1) body, collision; R to (4,1).\n\nSo can go U or R.\n\n(4,1) might be free.\n\nGo U to (3,2), etc.\n\nBetter than going left.\n\nBut let's see if I can avoid getting stuck.\n\nAnother option: from start, instead of going directly down, I go left or something to have more space.\n\nFor example, turn 1 move L to (1,3).\n\nThen snake to [(1,3), (2,3)]\n\nDirection left.\n\nTurn 2: from (1,3), can move D to (1,2), or U to (1,4), or L to (0,3) wall, cannot; R to (2,3) but (2,3) is body, collision? Positions: snake [(1,3), (2,3)], so (2,3) is tail.\n\nIf I move R to (2,3), which is tail position. Since it's the tail, and tail will move, it should be ok.\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving to tail is safe.\n\nSo from (1,3), move to (2,3) is possible, but (2,3) has no food, so just move, snake to [(2,3), (1,3)]? Head to (2,3), body to (1,3), so [(2,3), (1,3)]\n\nBut that doesn't achieve much.\n\nBetter to move down to (1,2) to go towards food.\n\nTurn 2 move D to (1,2), no food, snake to [(1,2), (1,3)]\n\nDirection down.\n\nThen turn 3 move D to (1,1), eat food, snake to [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3)]\n\nHead at (1,1), direction down.\n\nThen from (1,1), moves: U to (1,2) body, collision; D to (1,0) wall; L to (0,1) wall; R to (2,1) which has food? (2,1) has food, but is it occupied? After eating at (1,1), snake is [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3)], so (2,1) is free.\n\nMove R to (2,1), eat food, grow to [(2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)]\n\nHead at (2,1), direction right.\n\nThen from (2,1), as before, can go U or R or L, but L to (1,1) body, cannot; D wall; so U to (2,2) or R to (3,1).\n\n(3,1) has food, but let's see.\n\nIf go R to (3,1), eat, grow to length 5, etc.\n\nBut I need to think long-term survival.\n\nAlso, there is internal obstacle at (5,6), but not relevant yet.\n\nAnother thing: all food is at bottom, y=1, and walls below, so after eating, I need to move up to have space.\n\nBut the grid has space above.\n\nPerhaps I should not eat all food immediately to avoid getting trapped.\n\nSince snake is short, eating is good to grow, but then I need to navigate.\n\nBut with length 2, I have flexibility.\n\nLet's list all food: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1) all with value +1.\n\nLife spans: (2,1) life_span 9, (3,1) life_span 9, (1,1) life_span 10. At turn 1, so (1,1) lasts one turn longer.\n\nBut since we start at turn 1, and life span decreases each turn, (2,1) disappears after turn 9, etc.\n\nBut for 5 turns, all present.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should eat as much as possible, but with survival.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills.\n\nBut in this case, tail doesn't have food, so no issue.\n\nFor example, if snake is long, and tail has food, but here no.\n\nSo for now, no danger.\n\nBut after eating, when snake is longer, might have issues.\n\nAnother point: food can spawn under body, but here food is at (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), which are not under snake; snake is at (2,3) and (3,3), so (3,3) is above (3,1), but not the same cell.\n\nSo all food is accessible.\n\nNow, back to action.\n\nIf I go down to (2,2) on turn 1, then to (2,1) on turn 2 to eat, I get food on turn 2.\n\nThen on turn 3, from (2,1), I can go to (3,1) to eat another food, or to (1,1), or up.\n\nIf I go to (3,1), I eat and grow to length 4, but then I have snake along y=1 and x=2,3, which might be tight.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (1,1), same thing.\n\nBut I can go up instead.\n\nFrom (2,1) after eating, snake [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3)], I can go U to (2,2), but (2,2) is body, collision, cannot.\n\nAs before, only L or R.\n\nSo I must go to (1,1) or (3,1).\n\nSay I go to (3,1) on turn 3.\n\nThen eat at (3,1), snake [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)]\n\nThen from (3,1), I can go U to (3,2) or R to (4,1), since L to (2,1) body, D wall.\n\nGo U to (3,2), no food, snake moves: head to (3,2), body to (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), tail (2,3) moves to (2,2)? Positions before move: head (3,1), body (2,1), (2,2), tail (2,3)\n\nAfter move to (3,2): new head (3,2), then body (3,1), then (2,1), then (2,2), and (2,3) vacated.\n\nSnake [(3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2)]\n\nLength 4.\n\nFrom (3,2), can move U, D, L, R.\n\nL to (2,2) body, collision; R to (4,2); D to (3,1) body, collision; U to (3,3).\n\n(3,3) might be free; initially body, but after moves, should be free.\n\nInitial snake had (3,3), but after moving to (2,2) etc., (3,3) vacated.\n\nSo U to (3,3) or R to (4,2).\n\nSay go U to (3,3), then to (3,4), etc., have space.\n\nSimilarly, if I had gone to (1,1) first, it might be tighter on left.\n\nBut x=0 wall, so left side has less space.\n\nFor example, if snake at [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3)] after some moves, it can only move right or up, but with walls.\n\nSo to have more space, it's better to go towards the right or center.\n\nTherefore, from start, it might be better to go to (3,1) area.\n\nBut let's see the initial choice.\n\nAnother idea: on turn 1, move D to (2,2), then on turn 2, instead of D to (2,1), I could go R to (3,2) to approach (3,1).\n\nThen turn 2: from (2,2), move R to (3,2), no food, snake to [(3,2), (2,2)]\n\nDirection right.\n\nThen turn 3: from (3,2), can move D to (3,1) to eat, or U to (3,3), etc.\n\nMove D to (3,1), eat, snake to [(3,1), (3,2), (2,2)]\n\nThen from (3,1), as before.\n\nBut I ate on turn 3 instead of turn 2, so delayed eating.\n\nWorse for score, since I could have eaten earlier.\n\nSimilarly, if I go directly to (2,1) on turn 2, I eat on turn 2.\n\nThen on turn 3 I can eat another.\n\nSo for score, better to eat soon.\n\nBut with survival, after eating two, I have a line, but I can escape up.\n\nFor example, after eating at (2,1) and then at (3,1), snake at [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)] or something, then move up to (3,2), then to (3,3), etc.\n\nGrid has y up to 7, so plenty of space.\n\nSimilarly, internal obstacle at (5,6), not in the way.\n\nSo it should be fine.\n\nIf I eat at (1,1) first, I might be near wall.\n\nFor example, turn 1 move L to (1,3), then turn 2 move D to (1,2), turn 3 move D to (1,1) eat, snake [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3)]\n\nThen turn 4 move R to (2,1) eat, snake [(2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)]\n\nThen from (2,1), can move U to (2,2) or R to (3,1), but (2,2) might be free, etc.\n\nBut with walls on left, less space.\n\nSo better to be on the right.\n\nTherefore, from start, go D to (2,2) on turn 1, then D to (2,1) on turn 2 to eat, then on turn 3, go R to (3,1) to eat another food.\n\nThen from (3,1), go U to (3,2) to escape.\n\nThen I have score 2, and snake length 4, and can explore.\n\nBut I have three foods, I can eat all.\n\nOn turn 3, after eating at (2,1), if I go to (1,1) instead of (3,1), but (1,1) is on left, might be worse.\n\n(3,1) is better.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nTurn 1: move D to (2,2)\n\nThen snake: head (2,2), body (2,3)  (since tail moved from (3,3) to (2,3))\n\nInitial: turn 1 start, positions [(2,3), (3,3)]\n\nMove D to (2,2): head to (2,2), body to (2,3), so [(2,2), (2,3)]\n\nDirection down.\n\nTurn 2: move D to (2,1), which has food, so eat, grow to [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3)]\n\nDirection down.\n\nTurn 3: from (2,1), cannot go D (wall), cannot go U (body at (2,2)), can go L to (1,1) or R to (3,1).\n\nGo R to (3,1), eat, grow to [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)]\n\nDirection right.\n\nTurn 4: from (3,1), cannot go D (wall), cannot go L (body at (2,1)), can go U to (3,2) or R to (4,1).\n\nGo U to (3,2), no food, so snake moves: head to (3,2), body to (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), tail (2,3) moves to (2,2)? Positions: before move, head (3,1), body (2,1), (2,2), tail (2,3)\n\nAfter move to (3,2): new head (3,2), then body (3,1), then (2,1), then (2,2), and (2,3) vacated.\n\nSnake [(3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2)]\n\nDirection up.\n\nTurn 5: from (3,2), can move U to (3,3), D to (3,1) but (3,1) is body, collision, cannot; L to (2,2) body, collision; R to (4,2).\n\nSo only U or R.\n\nGo U to (3,3), no food, snake moves to [(3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1)]? Head to (3,3), body to (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), tail (2,2) removed? Before move: head (3,2), body (3,1), (2,1), tail (2,2)\n\nAfter move U to (3,3): new head (3,3), then body (3,2), then (3,1), then (2,1), and (2,2) vacated.\n\nSnake [(3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1)]\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI have eaten two food, score 2, length 4.\n\nI could eat the third food at (1,1), but it's on the left, and I am at (3,3), so far, and life span is 10, so by turn 10 it disappears, but I might not get there soon.\n\nOn turn 3, instead of going to (3,1), I could go to (1,1) from (2,1).\n\nTurn 3: from (2,1) go L to (1,1), eat, snake to [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)]\n\nThen from (1,1), only move U to (1,2), as before.\n\nThen to (1,2), then to (1,3), etc., but near wall.\n\nThen I can move right to (2,3), but (2,3) might be body.\n\nAfter eating at (1,1), snake [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)]\n\nMove U to (1,2), no food, snake to [(1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2)]\n\nThen from (1,2), can move U to (1,3), or R to (2,2) body, etc.\n\nOnly U to (1,3).\n\nThen to (1,3), and so on.\n\nBut I have eaten two, same as before, but now on left side.\n\nTo eat the third at (3,1), I need to go right, but with snake length 4, it might be possible, but takes time.\n\nFor example, from (1,3), move R to (2,3), but need to see if free.\n\nAfter some moves, positions change.\n\nBut it might take several turns, and (3,1) disappears after turn 9, so if current turn is low, possible.\n\nBut for efficiency, eating (3,1) from the right is better.\n\nIn the first plan, on turn 3 I eat (3,1), so I have all three food? No, I ate (2,1) and (3,1), but (1,1) is left.\n\nIn the sequence: turn 2 eat (2,1), turn 3 eat (3,1), so (1,1) uneaten.\n\nThen (1,1) has life_span 10, so until turn 10.\n\nI can go to eat it later.\n\nBut for now, with the plan, I have score 2 by turn 3.\n\nIf I don't eat immediately, I might eat later.\n\nBut since all food is positive, better to eat early to grow and have more options, but with survival.\n\nAnother option: on turn 1, I could move to (3,3) or something, but current head (2,3), move U to (2,4), then I am away from food.\n\nThen I need to come down, but food might disappear if I take too long, but life span long, so possible, but I eat later, so score lower in short term.\n\nFor example, turn 1 U to (2,4), snake [(2,4), (2,3)]\n\nThen turn 2, can move U, L, R (since direction up, cannot D reverse).\n\nU to (2,5), L to (1,4), R to (3,4).\n\nSay go down later, but to eat, I need to go to y=1, so multiple moves.\n\nWorse than going down directly.\n\nSimilarly, moving L to (1,3) first, then down, eats on turn 3, later than turn 2.\n\nSo for immediate reward, going down turn 1 is best.\n\nThen for turn 2, eat at (2,1).\n\nThen on turn 3, eat at (3,1) to get second food.\n\nThen move away.\n\nBut I need to plan 5+ turns ahead.\n\nIn the sequence I have:\n\nTurn 1: D to (2,2)\n\nTurn 2: D to (2,1) eat\n\nTurn 3: R to (3,1) eat\n\nTurn 4: U to (3,2)\n\nTurn 5: U to (3,3)\n\nNow, on turn 5, at (3,3), I can move to (3,4), (4,3), etc.\n\nThe food at (1,1) is still there, life_span 10, turn 5, so 5 turns left? Life_span at turn 1 is 10, decreases each turn.\n\nAt turn 1, life_span=10, after turn 1, it becomes 9, after turn 2, 8, ..., after turn 9, it becomes 0 and disappears before turn 10.\n\nSo at turn 5, life_span counter is 10 - 4 = 6? Let's see.\n\nAt the start of turn 1, life_span=10.\n\nAfter turn 1, it decreases to 9.\n\nAfter turn 2, to 8, ..., after turn 9, to 0, disappears.\n\nSo on turn t, before the turn, life_span is 11 - t for (1,1)? At turn 1, life_span=10.\n\nDuring turn 1, if head moves to it, eats, else after turn 1, life_span decreases to 9.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 5, before the turn, life_span=6 (since 10 - 4 =6? Decreased 4 times after 4 turns).\n\nStart turn 1: life_span L\n\nAfter turn t, life_span becomes L - t.\n\nBut for eating during turn t, if life_span >0, can eat.\n\nAt turn t, before move, life_span is L - (t - 1) for the value at turn 1.\n\nFor food at turn 1 with life_span N, at turn t, remaining life is N - (t - 1).\n\nWhen remaining life 0, disappears.\n\nFor (1,1), N=10, at turn t, remaining = 10 - (t-1)\n\nAt turn 1, remaining=10, can be eaten.\n\nAfter turn 1, if not eaten, remaining=9.\n\nAt turn 5, remaining=10 - (5-1) =10-4=6, so still there.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) N=9, at turn 5, remaining=9-4=5, etc.\n\nBut in my plan, I ate (2,1) and (3,1), so (1,1) is uneaten.\n\nI can go to eat (1,1) from turn 5 position.\n\nAt turn 5, snake at [(3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1)] as earlier? In my turn sequence, after turn 4: snake [(3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2)]? Let's list positions over turns.\n\nTurn 1: start, snake [(2,3), (3,3)]\n\nAction: move D to (2,2)\n\nAfter: snake [(2,2), (2,3)]\n\nTurn 2: move D to (2,1), eat, grow: snake [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3)]\n\nTurn 3: move R to (3,1), eat, grow: snake [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)]\n\nTurn 4: move U to (3,2), no eat, so move: head to (3,2), body to (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), tail (2,3) moves to (2,2)? Positions: before move, head (3,1), body (2,1), (2,2), tail (2,3)\n\nAfter move U to (3,2): new head (3,2), body: first segment to (3,1), second to (2,1), third to (2,2), and tail (2,3) not moved since no growth, so snake has segments: head (3,2), then (3,1), then (2,1), then (2,2) — but (2,2) was body, now tail.\n\nPositions: [(3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2)]\n\n(2,3) is vacated.\n\nTurn 5: move U to (3,3), no food, move: head to (3,3), body to (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), tail (2,2) moves to (2,1)? Before move: head (3,2), body (3,1), (2,1), tail (2,2)\n\nAfter move to (3,3): new head (3,3), body to (3,2), then to (3,1), then to (2,1), and (2,2) vacated.\n\nSnake [(3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1)]\n\nNow, at (3,3), I can move to eat (1,1).\n\nBut (1,1) is at (1,1), I am at (3,3), with snake body in between.\n\nTo go left, I need to move to (2,3) or (1,3), etc.\n\nFrom (3,3), possible moves: U to (3,4), D to (3,2) body, cannot; L to (2,3), R to (4,3).\n\n(2,3) might be free, as vacated earlier.\n\nMove L to (2,3).\n\nThen snake moves to [(2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)]? After move: head to (2,3), body to (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), tail (2,1) moves to (3,1)? Before move: head (3,3), body (3,2), (3,1), tail (2,1)\n\nAfter move L to (2,3): new head (2,3), body to (3,3), then to (3,2), then to (3,1), and (2,1) vacated.\n\nSnake [(2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)]\n\nThen from (2,3), can move L to (1,3), or D to (2,2), or U to (2,4), since direction left? After moving left to (2,3), direction left.\n\nFrom (2,3), move L to (1,3), no food, snake to [(1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2)]\n\nThen from (1,3), move D to (1,2), etc., eventually to (1,1).\n\nBut it takes many turns, and by turn 5 or 6, I might not reach (1,1) before it disappears, but life_span 10, turn 5, remaining 6, so possible, but inefficient.\n\nSince I have score 2, and I can explore other areas, perhaps not necessary to eat (1,1) if risky, but here no risk, just time.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should eat it if possible.\n\nBut in the initial turns, I could eat (1,1) first or something.\n\nLet's see if I can eat all three quickly.\n\nFor example, turn 1: move L to (1,3)\n\nThen snake [(1,3), (2,3)]\n\nTurn 2: move D to (1,2)\n\nSnake [(1,2), (1,3)]\n\nTurn 3: move D to (1,1) eat, snake [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3)]\n\nTurn 4: move R to (2,1) eat, snake [(2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)]\n\nTurn 5: from (2,1), move R to (3,1) eat, but can I? From (2,1), after moving right to (2,1)? At turn 4, head at (2,1), direction right.\n\nMove R to (3,1), eat, grow to [(3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)]\n\nThen I have eaten all three by turn 5, score 3.\n\nIn the first plan, I ate two by turn 3, but not the third.\n\nHere I ate all by turn 5.\n\nIn first plan: turn 2 eat (2,1), turn 3 eat (3,1), so by turn 3 score 2, and (1,1) left.\n\nThen to eat (1,1), it takes more turns, say from turn 4 or 5, but I am at (3,2) or (3,3), need to go to (1,1), which is far.\n\nFor example, from turn 3 position after eating (3,1): [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)]\n\nThen to go to (1,1), I need to move left and down, but down is wall, so move to (3,2), then to (2,3) or something, complicated.\n\nWhereas in this sequence, I eat all directly.\n\nIn the sequence I just described: turn 1 move L to (1,3), turn 2 move D to (1,2), turn 3 move D to (1,1) eat, turn 4 move R to (2,1) eat, turn 5 move R to (3,1) eat.\n\nOn turn 5, move to (3,1) from (2,1), but (3,1) has food, so eat.\n\nNow, after that, snake is at [(3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)] for turn 5 after move.\n\nBefore turn 5, after turn 4: snake [(2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)]\n\nMove R to (3,1), eat, so grow: head to (3,1), add new segment, so snake [(3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)] but the body is (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), so with new head, positions: head (3,1), then (2,1), then (1,1), then (1,2), then tail (1,3)\n\nLength 5.\n\nThen from (3,1), I can move U to (3,2) to escape.\n\nNo problem.\n\nAnd I have score 3 by turn 5.\n\nIn the first plan, with down first, I have score 2 by turn 3, but to get third, it might take until turn 7 or 8, so same or later.\n\nBut here I get all three.\n\nMoreover, in this sequence, I start by moving left, which is current direction, so no issue.\n\nCurrent direction is L, so moving L is fine.\n\nThen on turn 2, from (1,3), move D to (1,2), which is not reverse; reverse would be right, but I didn't move right.\n\nDirection after turn 1: moved left to (1,3), so direction left.\n\nTurn 2: move down, which is perpendicular, not reverse, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, all moves valid.\n\nAnd I eat all food quickly.\n\nAfter eating, I am at (3,1), can move up.\n\nLong-term survival: with length 5, I have more body, but grid has space, so I can navigate to open areas.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,6), not in the way.\n\nSo this seems better.\n\nIf I go down first, I might miss (1,1) or take longer.\n\nSo I think moving left first is better to eat all food.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 1: move L to (1,3)\n\nTurn 2: move D to (1,2)\n\nTurn 3: move D to (1,1) and eat\n\nTurn 4: move R to (2,1) and eat\n\nTurn 5: move R to (3,1) and eat\n\nThen for turn 6, from (3,1), move U to (3,2), etc.\n\nBut the answer should be for turns starting from t1=1, and I need to specify actions for several turns.\n\nThe format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it doesn't specify how many, but since think 5+ turns ahead, I should provide 5 actions or so.\n\nIn the boxed answer, list from turn 1 to say turn 5 or 6.\n\nNow, to confirm, is there any risk?\n\nFor example, when I move to (2,1) on turn 4, from (1,1), and (2,1) has food, but is there tail reward danger?\n\nTail is at (1,3), head at (1,1) before move, tail (1,3) not adjacent to (2,1), so no.\n\nSimilarly, when moving to (3,1) on turn 5, tail at (1,3) or after moves.\n\nAfter turn 4: snake [(2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)], head at (2,1), tail at (1,3)\n\n(1,3) and (3,1) not adjacent.\n\nNo issue.\n\nAlso, all moves are safe.\n\nSo this plan seems good.\n\nI could go directly down from start, but I might not get all food.\n\nSo I think left sequence is better.\n\nTherefore, for the answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, the strategy prioritizes eating all three positive food items efficiently. The snake starts at position (2,3) with direction left, and the food at (1,1), (2,1), and (3,1) all have high remaining life spans (9-10 turns at turn 1), allowing time to reach them. The plan involves moving left immediately to position (1,3) on turn 1, then descending to eat the food at (1,1) on turn 3, followed by moving right to eat the food at (2,1) on turn 4 and (3,1) on turn 5. This sequence ensures the snake eats all food by turn 5, increasing the score by 3 and the length to 5, while avoiding collisions and walls. After turn 5, the snake moves up to (3,2) to escape the bottom row and access open space for future turns.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Immediate Action (Turn 1)**: Moving left (L) to (1,3) aligns with the current direction and positions the snake to approach the food at (1,1) efficiently. Moving down (D) or up (U) would delay eating or move away from the food cluster.\n- **Food Access**: All food is positive (+1 score each) and accessible; none are under the snake's body initially. Eating in sequence from left to right minimizes movement and avoids tail reward danger (tail is never adjacent to the head when eating).\n- **Collision Avoidance**: All moves are checked for walls (borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and obstacle at (5,6)) and body collisions. After eating, the snake grows, but moves are planned to ensure the head never collides with the body except when moving to the tail cell (which is safe as the tail moves).\n- **Long-Term Survival**: After eating all food by turn 5, the snake moves up to open areas (e.g., (3,2) on turn 6) to avoid being trapped near walls. The internal obstacle at (5,6) is not a concern in this sequence. With a length of 5, the snake has flexibility to navigate the grid safely.\n- **5+ Turns Ahead**: The sequence covers turns 1-6, with turns 1-5 focused on eating and turn 6 on escaping. Beyond turn 6, the snake can explore the upper grid (e.g., moving to (3,3), (4,3), etc.) to find new food or avoid risks.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 1**: Move L (left) to (1,3). This starts the approach toward (1,1) without delay. Snake becomes [(1,3), (2,3)], direction L.\n- **Turn 2**: Move D (down) to (1,2). This moves closer to (1,1). Snake becomes [(1,2), (1,3)], direction D.\n- **Turn 3**: Move D (down) to (1,1) and eat the food (value +1). Snake grows to length 3: [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3)], direction D.\n- **Turn 4**: Move R (right) to (2,1) and eat the food (value +1). Snake grows to length 4: [(2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)], direction R.\n- **Turn 5**: Move R (right) to (3,1) and eat the food (value +1). Snake grows to length 5: [(3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)], direction R.\n- **Turn 6**: Move U (up) to (3,2). This escapes the bottom row for better mobility. Snake becomes [(3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2)] (tail (1,3) vacated), direction U.\n\nThis plan scores 3 points by turn 5 and ensures survival with a path to open areas. If new food appears, the snake can adapt while avoiding the obstacle at (5,6).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 1: L \\\\\nTurn 2: D \\\\\nTurn 3: D \\\\\nTurn 4: R \\\\\nTurn 5: R \\\\\nTurn 6: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 2, and the grid has walls and obstacles. The border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). There's an internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nThe snake is at positions: head at (1,3), body at (2,3). Since it's a list with two positions, the snake has length 2. The head direction is left, so it's moving left.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (2,1) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (3,1) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (1,1) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food here. Life spans are given, and they decrease each turn, including the current turn when we move.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks. I should prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nSnake: head at (1,3), body at (2,3). Direction left, so last move was left to (1,3) from (2,3)? Positions are (1,3) and (2,3), with head first. Since direction is left, it came from right to left, so from (2,3) to (1,3). But (2,3) is the body segment.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail follows, so the body segments shift.\n\nCurrent positions: index 0: head (1,3), index 1: tail (2,3).\n\nAfter a move, say to a new head position, the tail moves to the previous head position, so the body is updated.\n\nBut for collision, we care about the new head position relative to the body segments after movement.\n\nFood is at:\n\n- (2,1)\n\n- (3,1)\n\n- (1,1)\n\nAll at y=1, x=1,2,3.\n\n(1,1) is one, (2,1), (3,1).\n\nNow, life spans: for (2,1) life span 8 at turn 2, so it will disappear after 8 turns, meaning on turn 10 it might be gone? Let's clarify life span.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo at turn t, food has life span L, it will disappear after L turns, so it exists for L more turns including current? Countdown decreases each turn.\n\nAt turn t, with life span L, it will be present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappear at turn t+L.\n\nFor example, turn 2, life span 8: present from turn 2 to turn 9 (since 2 to 9 is 8 turns: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 — that's 8 turns), disappear on turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) life span 8, same.\n\n(1,1) life span 9: present from turn 2 to turn 10 (2 to 10 is 9 turns), disappear on turn 11.\n\nNow, snake head at (1,3), moving left. Possible moves: since direction is left, it can move left, up, or down, but not right because no instant reverse.\n\nCurrent head direction left, so cannot move right on next turn.\n\nPossible actions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1)\n\nBut R is opposite to L, so not allowed. So can do U, D, or L.\n\nNow, let's see what cells are available.\n\nFrom (1,3):\n\n- Left (L): (0,3) — but x=0 is wall, so collision, invalid.\n\n- Up (U): (1,4) — y+1, so (1,4)\n\n- Down (D): (1,2) — y-1, so (1,2)\n\n- Right (R): not allowed.\n\nSo only possible moves: U to (1,4) or D to (1,2).\n\nNow, need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, food is all at y=1, so down might be towards food.\n\nBut let's consider the grid.\n\nFirst, let's list all cells.\n\nI should consider the state after each move.\n\nSince snake is short, length 2, eating food will increase length.\n\nIf it eats food, length becomes 3, and the tail grows, so after eating, the tail stays in place or something.\n\nWhen snake eats food, it grows, so after moving to food, the head is on food, it eats, so length increases, meaning the tail does not move that turn. So the new tail position is the old tail position, not moved.\n\nStandard snake: when head moves to food, it eats, so tail doesn't move, snake grows by one.\n\nOtherwise, head moves to empty cell, tail moves forward, so length same.\n\nIn this case, since all food is positive, eating increases length and score.\n\nBut there's a danger: tail reward danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (2,3), head at (1,3). Are they adjacent? (1,3) and (2,3) are adjacent horizontally.\n\nBut the tail position (2,3) does not have food; food is at (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), all at y=1, not at (2,3). So no food on tail now.\n\nTail reward danger only if the tail cell has food and head is adjacent.\n\nHere, tail cell (2,3) has no food, so no issue.\n\nNow, possible moves from (1,3):\n\n- U to (1,4)\n\n- D to (1,2)\n\n(1,4): is it safe? No walls or obstacles. y=4, x=1, within 0-7, not wall. Internal obstacle at (5,6), far away. So (1,4) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) is empty.\n\nNow, if I go up to (1,4), what next? Need to plan ahead.\n\nSimilarly, down to (1,2), closer to food.\n\nBut let's think about getting to food.\n\nFood at (1,1), (2,1), (3,1).\n\n(1,1) is directly below (1,2)? From (1,3) down to (1,2), then from (1,2) down to (1,1) would eat the food.\n\nSimilarly, I could go to (2,1) or (3,1) but need to move accordingly.\n\nBut let's consider the life spans. All have high life span, 8 or 9, so plenty of time, no rush.\n\nBut since the snake is at (1,3), going down might be efficient.\n\nBut need to avoid risks.\n\nAlso, after eating, snake grows, which might make it harder to maneuver.\n\nCurrently length 2, after eating one food, length 3.\n\nThen more body to avoid.\n\nNow, let's simulate possible paths.\n\nFirst, turn 2: must choose action for turn 2.\n\nOptions: U or D.\n\nIf U to (1,4):\n\n- New head position: (1,4)\n\n- Snake was at [(1,3), (2,3)], after move to (1,4), since (1,4) has no food (food only at y=1), so no eat, tail moves to (1,3). So new positions: head (1,4), body (1,3). Tail is (1,3).\n\nLength still 2.\n\nNow, head at (1,4), direction: since moved up, new head direction is U.\n\nThen turn 3: from (1,4), possible moves: U, D, L, R? But current direction U, so cannot move down (opposite), so can move U, L, or R.\n\n- U: (1,5)\n\n- L: (0,4) — wall, invalid\n\n- R: (2,4)\n\n- D: not allowed (opposite)\n\nSo possible: U to (1,5) or R to (2,4)\n\nIf U to (1,5), then head at (1,5), body at (1,4), and so on. This is going away from food, might not be good for scoring.\n\nIf R to (2,4), then head to (2,4), no food, tail to (1,4), positions: head (2,4), body (1,4). Direction right.\n\nThen turn 4: from (2,4), direction R, can move U, R, D (not L, opposite).\n\n- U: (2,5)\n\n- R: (3,4)\n\n- D: (2,3)\n\n(2,3) is where the body was, but after turn 3, body is at (1,4), so (2,3) is empty now? After move to (2,4), positions are (2,4) and (1,4), so (2,3) is free.\n\nSimilarly, all possible moves seem safe for now, but we're getting farther from food.\n\nNot efficient for scoring.\n\nNow, other option at turn 2: go down to (1,2)\n\nTurn 2: move D to (1,2)\n\n(1,2) has no food (food at y=1), so no eat. Tail moves to (1,3)? Snake was [(1,3), (2,3)], head moves to (1,2), so new head (1,2), tail moves to previous head (1,3). But previous head was (1,3), which is now the body.\n\nPositions: head (1,2), body (1,3). Tail is (1,3).\n\nDirection: moved down, so D.\n\nNow turn 3: from (1,2), direction D, so cannot move up (opposite), so can move D, L, or R.\n\n- D: (1,1) — which has food! (1,1) has food with value 1, life span 9.\n\n- L: (0,2) — wall, invalid\n\n- R: (2,2)\n\nSo possible moves: D to (1,1) or R to (2,2)\n\nIf move D to (1,1), it eats the food because (1,1) has food.\n\nWhen head moves to (1,1), it eats the food, so length increases. Tail does not move. New positions: head at (1,1), body segments: the previous body (1,3) remains, and since tail didn't move, the new body is the old head position? Let's think.\n\nBefore move: positions [(1,2), (1,3)] with head at (1,2), body at (1,3)? After turn 2, positions are head (1,2) and body (1,3).\n\nNow, move to (1,1): since (1,1) has food, head moves to (1,1), eats food, so the tail does not move. Therefore, the snake grows: new head at (1,1), and the body now includes the previous head (1,2) and the previous body (1,3). So positions: [ (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) ].\n\nLength 3.\n\nDirection: moved down to (1,1), so direction D.\n\nNow, life span of (1,1) food: it was present at turn 2 with life span 9, so at turn 3, it is still there? Countdown decreases each turn.\n\nAt turn 2, food at (1,1) has life span 9, meaning it will disappear after 9 turns from turn 2, so present until turn 10.\n\nAt turn 3, it is eaten, so removed.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, after eating, head at (1,1), body at (1,2) and (1,3).\n\nDirection down.\n\nNow turn 4: from (1,1), direction D, so cannot move up (opposite).\n\nPossible moves: D, L, R.\n\n- D: (1,0) — but y=0 is wall, invalid\n\n- L: (0,1) — wall, invalid\n\n- R: (2,1) — which has food!\n\n(2,1) has food with value 1, life span 8.\n\nBut is it safe to eat?\n\nHead is at (1,1), tail is at (1,3)? Positions: head (1,1), then (1,2), then tail (1,3).\n\nIs head adjacent to tail? (1,1) and (1,3) are not adjacent; they are two cells apart, since (1,2) in between.\n\nAdjacent means sharing edge, so up/down/left/right, so (1,1) and (1,2) are adjacent, (1,2) and (1,3) adjacent, but (1,1) and (1,3) are not directly adjacent; they are diagonal? No, in grid, (1,1) and (1,3) are not adjacent; they have (1,2) between them, so distance 2.\n\nSo not adjacent.\n\nTherefore, moving to (2,1) should be fine.\n\nBut let's see: if move R to (2,1), it has food, so eat it.\n\nThen new head at (2,1), eat, tail does not move. So positions: new head (2,1), then previous head (1,1) becomes body, then (1,2), then (1,3). So [ (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) ]? Length 4.\n\nBut the body includes (1,1), (1,2), (1,3).\n\nDirection: moved right, so R.\n\nNow, but (1,3) is the tail.\n\nNow turn 5: from (2,1), direction R, so cannot move L (opposite).\n\nPossible moves: U, R, D.\n\n- U: (2,2)\n\n- R: (3,1) — which has food!\n\n- D: (2,0) — wall, invalid\n\nSo U to (2,2) or R to (3,1)\n\nIf R to (3,1), eat food, since (3,1) has food.\n\nThen head to (3,1), eat, tail doesn't move, positions: head (3,1), then (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). Length 5.\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen turn 6: from (3,1), direction R, cannot move L.\n\nPossible moves: U, R, D.\n\n- U: (3,2)\n\n- R: (4,1)\n\n- D: (3,0) wall, invalid\n\nSo U or R.\n\nBut now snake is long, and we have internal obstacle at (5,6), but far away.\n\nThis path seems to eat all three food quickly: at turn 3 eat (1,1), turn 4 eat (2,1), turn 5 eat (3,1), all by turn 5.\n\nBut is it safe?\n\nIn turn 4, after eating (1,1) and moving to (2,1), positions were [ (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) ]\n\nThen moving to (3,1), no issue.\n\nBut after eating (3,1), head at (3,1), body at (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)\n\nNow, the tail is at (1,3), which is far.\n\nBut there might be a risk later.\n\nIn this sequence, by turn 5, we ate all food, score +3.\n\nBut we need to survive and maybe find more food, but no other food mentioned, so perhaps that's all for now.\n\nBut the food might disappear if not eaten, but with life spans, they last long.\n\nIn this case, we ate them early.\n\nBut is there a risk in moving down immediately?\n\nBack to turn 2.\n\nIf at turn 2, I move down to (1,2), then turn 3 move down to (1,1) to eat, as above.\n\nBut at turn 3, I could choose not to eat immediately and go right to (2,2).\n\nFor example, if I want to eat other food first.\n\nBut (1,1) has longer life span? (1,1) life span 9, others 8, so (1,1) lasts longer, but since we can eat all, it might not matter.\n\nIf I go to (2,2) at turn 3.\n\nFrom turn 2: move D to (1,2), positions [ (1,2), (1,3) ], direction D.\n\nTurn 3: from (1,2), instead of D to (1,1), move R to (2,2)\n\n(2,2) no food, so no eat, tail moves to (1,2)? Positions: head to (2,2), tail moves to previous head (1,2), so new positions [ (2,2), (1,2) ]\n\nDirection right.\n\nThen turn 4: from (2,2), direction R, can move U, R, D (not L).\n\n- U: (2,3)\n\n- R: (3,2)\n\n- D: (2,1) — which has food\n\nIf move D to (2,1), eat food.\n\nThen head to (2,1), eat, tail doesn't move, so positions: head (2,1), body (2,2), (1,2) — since previous body was (1,2), and tail didn't move.\n\nBefore move: positions [ (2,2), (1,2) ]\n\nMove to (2,1): has food, so head to (2,1), eat, tail does not move, so new positions: head (2,1), then previous head (2,2) becomes body, and previous body (1,2) remains, so [ (2,1), (2,2), (1,2) ]\n\nLength 3.\n\nDirection down.\n\nThen I can go to (3,1) or other.\n\nBut (1,1) is still there, and (3,1).\n\nThis might be slower.\n\nThe first path eats all by turn 5.\n\nBut in the first path, after eating (3,1) at turn 5, head at (3,1), body at (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)\n\nNow, from (3,1), direction R, can move U or R (since D invalid).\n\nMove U to (3,2), for example.\n\nThen no immediate danger.\n\nBut the snake is along the bottom, might be trapped later, but with internal obstacle, but far.\n\nSince no other food, and walls, we need to survive, but eating all food gives score, and we can just move around safely.\n\nBut in this case, with the down move at turn 2, we get to eat quickly.\n\nBut is there a risk with tail reward danger or something?\n\nIn this sequence, no, because when we ate, head was not adjacent to tail except possibly.\n\nFor example, when we ate (2,1) at turn 4 in first sequence.\n\nAt that time, positions before move: head (1,1), body (1,2), tail (1,3)\n\nMove to (2,1): head now (2,1), tail at (1,3), not adjacent.\n\nSimilarly, others fine.\n\nBut what about the option to go up at turn 2?\n\nIf go up to (1,4) at turn 2.\n\nThen positions: head (1,4), body (1,3), direction U.\n\nTurn 3: can move U or R (since L invalid, D not allowed)\n\nIf U to (1,5), then head (1,5), body (1,4), etc., getting farther.\n\nIf R to (2,4), head (2,4), body (1,4), direction R.\n\nTurn 4: from (2,4), can move U, R, D.\n\n- U: (2,5)\n\n- R: (3,4)\n\n- D: (2,3)\n\n(2,3) was the initial tail, but now empty.\n\nSay move D to (2,3), no food, so positions head (2,3), body (2,4)\n\nThen turn 5: from (2,3), direction D? Moved down from (2,4) to (2,3), so direction D.\n\nCan move L, R, D (not U).\n\n- L: (1,3)\n\n- R: (3,3)\n\n- D: (2,2)\n\nAnd so on. Eventually, I need to go down to y=1 to get food, but it takes more turns, and food might disappear if I take too long, but life spans long, so possible, but I score later, and risk of making mistake.\n\nWhereas going down immediately scores quickly.\n\nBut is there a reason not to go down?\n\nOne thing: the internal obstacle at (5,6), but it's not in the way.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: but not applicable now.\n\nAnother thing: when moving to (1,1) from (1,2), at turn 3, if I go down to (1,1), I eat, but after that, head at (1,1), which is corner, with walls at x=0 and y=0.\n\nFrom (1,1), I can only move right, since left and down are walls.\n\nIn turn 4, from (1,1), direction D, but after eating, direction is D, but I moved down to (1,1), so direction down.\n\nThen possible moves: cannot move up (opposite to down), so can move left, right, down.\n\nBut left: (0,1) wall\n\nDown: (1,0) wall\n\nRight: (2,1) which has food.\n\nSo only right to (2,1), as I did.\n\nSo no choice; I have to go right to (2,1).\n\nThen similarly to (3,1).\n\nNow, after eating (3,1) at turn 5, head at (3,1), body at (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)\n\nDirection right.\n\nNow turn 6: from (3,1), direction R, cannot move left.\n\nPossible moves: U, R, D.\n\nD: (3,0) wall, invalid.\n\nR: (4,1)\n\nU: (3,2)\n\nBoth possible.\n\nSay move U to (3,2), no food, so tail moves: positions head (3,2), then body: (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2) — tail is (1,2)? Let's see.\n\nBefore move: positions [ (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) ] head (3,1), tail (1,3)\n\nMove to (3,2): no food, so head to (3,2), tail moves to (1,2)? When no eat, head moves to new cell, and tail moves forward, so the last segment is removed.\n\nPositions: old head was (3,1), move to (3,2), no food, so new head (3,2), and the body is the old body without the tail: so old body was (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) — remove tail (1,3), so body becomes (3,1) [which was head, now body], (2,1), (1,1), (1,2)\n\nNew positions: head (3,2), then (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2)\n\nTail at (1,2)\n\nThen I can move around.\n\nBut the point is, by going down at turn 2, I can eat all food by turn 5 with no risk.\n\nIf I go up, I might eat later or miss if life span short, but here not.\n\nBut there is another food at (3,1), which I eat.\n\nIn the down path, I eat all.\n\nBut at turn 2, if I go down, and then at turn 3 I must go down to eat (1,1), or I could go right, but then I might not get (1,1) easily.\n\nFor example, if at turn 3 I go right to (2,2), then I can go down to (2,1) to eat, but (1,1) is still there, and I need to go to (1,1) from there.\n\nFrom (2,1), I can go left to (1,1), but head at (2,1), move left to (1,1), which has food.\n\nBut at that point, when I move to (1,1), what is the tail?\n\nSuppose turn 2: move D to (1,2), positions [ (1,2), (1,3) ] dir D\n\nTurn 3: move R to (2,2), positions [ (2,2), (1,2) ] dir R (since moved right)\n\nTurn 4: move D to (2,1), which has food, eat, so positions: head (2,1), body (2,2), (1,2) — since tail didn't move, length 3.\n\nDir down (moved down)\n\nNow, (1,1) is adjacent left? Head at (2,1), (1,1) is left, and it has food.\n\nCan I move left to (1,1)?\n\nPossible moves: from (2,1), dir down, can move L, R, D (not U)\n\n- L: (1,1) — has food\n\n- R: (3,1) — has food\n\n- D: (2,0) wall\n\nSo can move L to (1,1) or R to (3,1)\n\nIf move L to (1,1), eat food.\n\nBut now, head moving to (1,1), and tail is at (1,2)? Positions before move: head (2,1), body (2,2), tail (1,2)\n\n(1,2) is the tail.\n\nNow, (1,1) and (1,2) are adjacent: (1,1) down is nothing, but (1,1) and (1,2) share an edge? (1,1) and (1,2) are vertically adjacent? x same, y differ by 1, so yes, adjacent.\n\n(1,1) and (1,2) are adjacent cells.\n\nNow, if head moves to (1,1), and tail is at (1,2), and (1,1) has food, so when head moves to (1,1), it eats the food, so tail does not move.\n\nTherefore, after eating, head is at (1,1), and the body includes the previous positions: since tail didn't move, new positions: head (1,1), then previous head (2,1) becomes body, and previous body (2,2) and (1,2) remain.\n\nSo positions: [ (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (1,2) ]\n\nBut (1,2) is the tail, and it is adjacent to head (1,1).\n\nAfter this, the head is at (1,1) and tail at (1,2), which are adjacent.\n\nBut is this a problem?\n\nThe rule: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nHere, when I eat at (1,1), the tail cell is (1,2), which does not have food; the food is on the head cell (1,1).\n\nThe rule says \"the tail cell has positive food\", meaning food on the tail position.\n\nIn this case, tail position is (1,2), which has no food; food is on (1,1), which is the head position after move.\n\nSo no food on tail cell, so it should be safe.\n\nAfter eating, head at (1,1), body at (2,1), (2,2), tail at (1,2).\n\nNow, head (1,1) and tail (1,2) are adjacent, but no immediate collision because they are not on same cell.\n\nBut later, when I move, if I move in a way that head goes towards tail, but since tail moves, it might be ok, but need to be careful.\n\nSpecifically, the danger is only when eating food on the tail cell when head adjacent.\n\nHere, not the case.\n\nSo moving to (1,1) is fine.\n\nIn this sequence, I ate (2,1) at turn 4, then (1,1) at turn 5, but (3,1) is still there.\n\nThen from (1,1), after eating, direction is left? Moved left from (2,1) to (1,1), so direction L.\n\nThen from (1,1), dir L, cannot move R (opposite), can move U, L, D.\n\nBut L: (0,1) wall, D: (1,0) wall, U: (1,2) — but (1,2) is the tail!\n\nPositions: head (1,1), body (2,1), (2,2), tail (1,2)\n\n(1,2) is tail.\n\nIf I move up to (1,2), but (1,2) is occupied by the tail, so collision.\n\nCannot move to a body segment.\n\nAt turn 5, after eating (1,1) at turn 5? Let's clarify turns.\n\nTurn 4: moved to (2,1) and ate, so at end of turn 4, positions [ (2,1), (2,2), (1,2) ] head (2,1)\n\nTurn 5: move to (1,1) and eat, so positions now [ (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (1,2) ]\n\nNow, at turn 6, from head (1,1), direction left (since moved left).\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (1,2) — but (1,2) is occupied by tail, so collision, invalid\n\n- L: (0,1) wall, invalid\n\n- D: (1,0) wall, invalid\n\n- R: (2,1) — but (2,1) is occupied by body segment\n\n(2,1) is a body segment, so moving to (2,1) would be collision.\n\nTherefore, from (1,1), after eating (1,1), I have no valid moves! Stuck.\n\nBecause all adjacent cells are walls or body.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- Up: (1,2) is tail, body\n\n- Down: wall\n\n- Left: wall\n\n- Right: (2,1) is body\n\nAll invalid, so snake dies.\n\nOh! Big problem.\n\nIn this alternative path, if I don't eat (1,1) first and instead go to (2,2) then (2,1), then to (1,1), I get stuck after eating (1,1).\n\nBut in the first path, when I ate (1,1) first at turn 3, then I moved right to (2,1), which was fine because the tail was at (1,3), not adjacent.\n\nThen I could move to (3,1), etc.\n\nSo the sequence matters.\n\nTherefore, to avoid this, I should eat (1,1) first when the snake is short, so that I don't get trapped.\n\nIn the direct path: turn 2 down to (1,2), turn 3 down to (1,1) eat, then turn 4 right to (2,1) eat, turn 5 right to (3,1) eat.\n\nAfter turn 5, head at (3,1), body at (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)\n\nNow turn 6: from (3,1), I can move up to (3,2) or right to (4,1).\n\nSay move up to (3,2), no food, so tail moves: positions head (3,2), body (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2) — tail (1,2)\n\nThen I can continue moving.\n\nNo immediate trap.\n\nSo the initial down move is better.\n\nIf at turn 2 I go up, I might not get stuck but score later.\n\nBut since maximizing score and all food can be eaten, going down is preferable.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (1,1) has life span 9, others 8, but since I eat early, fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if there is negative food, but here all positive.\n\nAlso, special case: food can spawn under body, but here no, all food is at different positions.\n\nIn this state, no food under snake.\n\nSo for turn 2, best to move down to (1,2).\n\nThen turn 3, move down to (1,1) to eat.\n\nThen turn 4, move right to (2,1) to eat.\n\nThen turn 5, move right to (3,1) to eat.\n\nThen after that, I need to move away.\n\nFor example, turn 6, from (3,1), move up to (3,2).\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nThe answer should be for turns starting from t1=2.\n\nSo for turn 2, action; turn 3, action; etc.\n\nSince I need to think 5 turns ahead, and t1=2, so up to turn 7 or so.\n\nBut in the sequence, by turn 5 I ate all, then turn 6 and 7 I can move safely.\n\nFor example, after eating (3,1) at turn 5, head at (3,1), dir R.\n\nTurn 6: move U to (3,2), no food, so tail moves: positions head (3,2), body (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2) — tail (1,2)\n\nDir U (up).\n\nTurn 7: from (3,2), dir U, cannot move D, so can move U, L, R.\n\n- U: (3,3)\n\n- L: (2,2)\n\n- R: (4,2)\n\nAll possible, say move U to (3,3) or something.\n\nBut since no more food, it doesn't matter, as long as safe.\n\nTo be specific.\n\nIn the output, I need to list actions for several turns.\n\nNow, back to the beginning, at turn 2, only two choices: U or D.\n\nD seems better for immediate scoring.\n\nBut is there a risk with the internal obstacle? (5,6) is far, not an issue.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid going down if there is a trap, but here no.\n\nAnother point: when I move to (1,1) at turn 3, it's a corner, but since I move out immediately to right, it's fine.\n\nIf I had no choice, but I do.\n\nSo I think moving down at turn 2 is optimal.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 2: D (down)\n\nTurn 3: D (down to eat (1,1))\n\nTurn 4: R (right to eat (2,1))\n\nTurn 5: R (right to eat (3,1))\n\nThen for turn 6: say U (up to (3,2))\n\nTurn 7: say U to (3,3) or something.\n\nBut since the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I need to output for at least 5 turns, from turn 2 to turn 6 or 7.\n\nt1=2, so turns 2,3,4,5,6 for 5 turns ahead.\n\n5 turns ahead from turn 2 would be planning for turn 2,3,4,5,6? Thinking ahead means considering future turns.\n\nBut in output, it should be actions for consecutive turns starting from t1.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, etc.\n\nAnd it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should output for multiple turns, say 5 actions.\n\nSince t1=2, output for turn 2,3,4,5,6.\n\nIn my sequence, turn 2: D, turn 3: D, turn 4: R, turn 5: R, turn 6: U\n\nAfter turn 5, head at (3,1), after moving to (3,1) at turn 5.\n\nThen turn 6: from (3,1), I move U to (3,2)\n\nIs that safe? Yes.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nPerhaps I can output more if needed.\n\nBut 5 turns should be fine.\n\nNow, confirm the grid.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are borders, so cells outside invalid.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,6), but not relevant for now.\n\nIn turn 6, moving to (3,2) is fine.\n\nThen I can stop.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 3, when I move to (1,1), it is food, so I eat and grow.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nNow, about the tail reward danger: never triggered because no food on tail when adjacent.\n\nIn this case, all good.\n\nIf I had gone up first, I might miss the opportunity or take longer.\n\nFor example, life span of (2,1) and (3,1) is 8, from turn 2 to turn 9.\n\nIf I go up, by turn 9 I might not get there, but possible, but inefficient.\n\nSo down is better.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 2: D\n\nTurn 3: D\n\nTurn 4: R\n\nTurn 5: R\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nBut turn 6 U is after eating all, so it's fine.\n\nTo make it 5 actions.\n\nPerhaps I should include turn 7, but not necessary.\n\nThe answer should be in boxed.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, the AI must plan at least 5 turns ahead, prioritizing eating all available positive food while avoiding collisions and dead ends. The current state (turn 2) has the snake at positions [(1,3), (2,3)] with head direction left. Food is at (1,1), (2,1), and (3,1), all with value +1 and sufficient life spans (8 or 9 turns remaining). The grid has border walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 and an internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\n### Analysis and Plan:\n- **Immediate Moves (Turn 2)**: The snake head is at (1,3) moving left. Valid moves are up (U) to (1,4) or down (D) to (1,2). Moving down is preferred as it positions the snake closer to the food cluster at y=1, enabling efficient eating over the next few turns. Moving up would delay eating and risk missing food with shorter life spans (e.g., (2,1) and (3,1) disappear after turn 9).\n- **Eating Sequence**: \n  - Turn 3: Move down to (1,2) → then down to (1,1) to eat the food, increasing length to 3. This is safe as the tail is at (1,3), not adjacent to (1,1).\n  - Turn 4: Move right to (2,1) to eat the food, increasing length to 4. Safe, as head (1,1) and tail (1,3) are not adjacent.\n  - Turn 5: Move right to (3,1) to eat the food, increasing length to 5. Safe, with no adjacent tail risk.\n- **Post-Eating Maneuvers**: After eating all food by turn 5, the snake must avoid walls and self-collision. From (3,1), moving up to (3,2) on turn 6 is safe and opens space for future movement. Further moves can explore the grid safely, but no more food is present.\n- **Risks Avoided**: \n  - No tail reward danger: Food was never on the tail cell when the head was adjacent.\n  - No dead ends: Eating (1,1) first prevents the corner trap that could occur if eaten later (e.g., getting stuck at (1,1) with a longer body).\n  - Wall and obstacle avoidance: The internal obstacle at (5,6) is irrelevant for this sequence; border walls are respected.\n- **5+ Turn Lookahead**: The plan eats all food by turn 5 (maximizing immediate score) and ensures survival by moving to open areas (turn 6 onward). Life spans (food disappears after turn 9 or 10) are respected, with all food eaten early.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe actions for turns 2 to 6 are as follows:\n- Turn 2: Move down (D) to (1,2) – positions snake for food access.\n- Turn 3: Move down (D) to (1,1) – eat food, grow to length 3.\n- Turn 4: Move right (R) to (2,1) – eat food, grow to length 4.\n- Turn 5: Move right (R) to (3,1) – eat food, grow to length 5.\n- Turn 6: Move up (U) to (3,2) – avoid bottom wall and create space for future moves.\n\nThis sequence scores +3 by turn 5, with no risk, and sets up for safe exploration.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 2: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 3: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 4: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 5: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 6: U (up)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 3, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the borders are from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7. Walls are at the borders and there's an internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (1,2), and the body is at (1,3). Since it's only two segments, the tail is at (1,3). Head direction is down, which is D, meaning moving towards decreasing y, so from (1,2) to (1,3) would be down? Let's clarify coordinates.\n\nAssuming (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? Typically in grids, (0,0) might be top-left with y increasing downwards, but here head direction is D, which is down, and snake positions are [(1,2), (1,3)]. If head is at (1,2) and moving to (1,3), that would be increasing y if y=0 is top? But direction is D, down, which might imply decreasing y. I need to standardize.\n\nThe movement definitions: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y). So:\n\n- U: up, y increases\n\n- D: down, y decreases\n\n- L: left, x decreases\n\n- R: right, x increases\n\nAnd positions: (x,y). Let's assume (0,0) is the bottom-left corner for consistency, so y increases upwards. But in many systems, (0,0) is top-left with y down. I need to see from the movement.\n\nHead direction is D, down, meaning (x,y-1). Snake positions: head at (1,2), body at (1,3). If head is moving down to (1,3), that means from (1,2) to (1,3) is down, so y=3 must be below y=2? That suggests y increases upwards? Let's think.\n\nIf moving down decreases y, then from (1,2) to (1,1) would be down. But here, positions are [(1,2), (1,3)], with head at (1,2) and body at (1,3). Since head direction is D, down, that means the head is moving towards decreasing y, so it came from a higher y to (1,2). Positions are given head first, so the head is at (1,2), and the next segment is at (1,3). If head is moving down, it should be going to (1,1) or something, but the body is at (1,3), which must be where it came from.\n\nPerhaps the snake is moving upwards? Head direction D means it was moving down when it arrived at (1,2). But at turn 3, head is at (1,2), and it moved there from previous position. Since head direction is D, it was moving down to reach (1,2), so it came from (1,3) to (1,2) by moving down? Moving down decreases y, so from (1,3) to (1,2) is down, decreasing y from 3 to 2. Then (1,3) is the previous position, which is the body segment. So y=3 is above y=2, meaning y increases upwards. So (0,0) is bottom-left, y=0 bottom, y=7 top, I think.\n\nConfirm with food positions: food at (2,1), (3,1), (1,1). If y=0 is bottom, then (1,1) is above (1,0), so y=1 is row 1 from bottom.\n\nBut walls: y=0 and y=7 are borders. So y=0 is bottom row, y=7 is top row.\n\nSimilarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nSo grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, with (0,0) bottom-left, (7,7) top-right? (7,7) would be top-right if y increases up.\n\n(7,7) is x max, y max, so top-right if y up.\n\nIn this case, head at (1,2), body at (1,3). Since body is at (1,3) and head at (1,2), and head direction D (down, y decreasing), so the snake was at (1,3) previous turn, moved down to (1,2), so now at turn 3, head is (1,2), moving direction is D.\n\nFor next move, I can choose to go U, D, L, R, but with constraints: no instant reverse. Since current direction is D, I cannot move U immediately, because U is opposite of D. D is down (y-1), U is up (y+1), so yes, opposite, so I cannot move U next.\n\nPossible moves from (1,2): L (left, x-1,y) to (0,2), R (right, x+1,y) to (2,2), D (down, x,y-1) to (1,1), or U (up, x,y+1) to (1,3). But U to (1,3) is where the body is, but since the body will move when I move, it might be ok, but let's see rules.\n\nRules: I can move into the tail segment because the tail will move forward, so it's not a collision unless I hit other body parts.\n\nSnake has only two segments: head at (1,2), tail at (1,3). If I move U to (1,3), that is the current tail position. When I move, head goes to (1,3), and since I'm moving, the tail will move from (1,3) to... where? After moving, the new head position is where I move, and the body follows. Since there are only two segments, if head moves to (1,3), which is the current tail, then the tail will move to where the head was, but since head was at (1,2), and tail moves to (1,2)? Let's simulate.\n\nAt turn 3, positions: head (1,2), body (1,3).\n\nI choose to move, say, to a new position.\n\nIf I move to (1,3), which is the current tail position, then after move, new head is (1,3), and the body segment (which was tail) now becomes the new tail, but it moves to the previous head position, which is (1,2). So new snake positions: head (1,3), tail (1,2). But (1,2) is now the tail.\n\nIs there a collision? Head is at (1,3), tail at (1,2), no collision.\n\nBut if there were more body segments, it might be an issue, but here only two, so moving to the tail cell is safe.\n\nSimilarly, moving to other cells.\n\nBut I also have to avoid walls and obstacles.\n\nWalls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (2,1) with value 1, life span 7\n\n- (3,1) with value 1, life span 7\n\n- (1,1) with value 1, life span 8\n\nAll food have value +1, so all positive food, no negative food mentioned.\n\nLife span: for (2,1) and (3,1), life span 7 at turn 3, so they disappear after 7 turns? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn t, if life span is L, it disappears at turn t + L - something? Let's see the rule.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for food at (2,1), life span 7 at turn 3. That means, at turn 3, life span is 7, so it will disappear after 7 turns from now? Countdown decreases every turn including current, so at turn 3, countdown=7, after turn 3 it becomes 6, turn 4:5, ..., turn 9:0, so disappears after turn 9? Or at the end of turn when countdown reaches 0?\n\nTypically, if countdown decreases every turn including current, and disappears when countdown reaches 0.\n\nAt turn t, with life span L, the food is present from turn t to turn t + L - 1, and disappears at turn t + L.\n\nExample: at turn 3, life span 7, so:\n\n- Turn 3: countdown=7\n\n- After turn 3, countdown=6 (before turn 4)\n\n- Turn 4: countdown=6? No.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nI think it means that at the start of turn, the countdown is decreased, and if it reaches 0, it disappears before the turn.\n\nBut to simplify, since we're at turn 3, and life span 7, it means it has 7 turns left including this one, so it will be gone after 6 more turns? Let's see.\n\nRule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for food at turn t, with life span N:\n\n- At turn t, countdown = N\n\n- After turn t, countdown = N-1 (for turn t+1)\n\n- ...\n\n- When countdown reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nSo at turn t, if life span N, it will be present for N more turns, disappearing at turn t + N.\n\nAt turn t, countdown starts at N, decreases to N-1 after the turn, so after turn t, for turn t+1, countdown is N-1, and so on, until after turn t + N - 1, countdown becomes 0, and it disappears before turn t + N.\n\nBut for eating, as long as countdown >0, it can be eaten.\n\nIn this case, at turn 3, food at (2,1) life span 7, so countdown=7, so it can be eaten from turn 3 to turn 9 (since after turn 9, countdown=0, gone).\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) life span 7, same.\n\n(1,1) life span 8, countdown=8 at turn 3, so lasts until turn 10.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritizing long-term survival.\n\nCurrent snake: head at (1,2), tail at (1,3), direction D.\n\nPossible moves from (1,2):\n\n- U: to (1,3) - but (1,3) is current tail, but as we saw, moving there is safe since tail moves away.\n\n- D: to (1,1) - down to (1,1)\n\n- L: to (0,2) - left, but x=0 is wall, so cannot move to wall. (0,2) is on border, x=0, so wall, collision, death.\n\n- R: to (2,2) - right to (2,2)\n\nAlso, no instant reverse: current direction D, so I cannot move U, because U is opposite of D. U is up (y+1), D is down (y-1), so opposite directions.\n\nSo, cannot move U.\n\nTherefore, possible moves: D to (1,1), or R to (2,2).\n\nU is not allowed because of no instant reverse.\n\nSo only D or R.\n\nNow, (1,1) has food! (1,1) is a food position with value 1.\n\nIf I move D to (1,1), I eat the food, since head moves to food cell.\n\nThen, snake grows: since positive food, length increases by one, so after eating, snake will have three segments.\n\nCurrent length 2, after eating, head at (1,1), new segment, and tail at (1,2)? Let's simulate.\n\nCurrent: head (1,2), tail (1,3)\n\nMove D to (1,1): head moves to (1,1), which has food, so eat it, snake grows. So new head at (1,1), and since it grew, the tail stays where it was? No, when snake moves, it always moves, and if it eats, a new segment is added at the head position after move, but the body extends.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat, you grow, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n\nRule: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food.\n\nSo when head moves to a food cell, it eats, and the snake grows by one segment. That means, after moving to food, the new segment is added, and the tail remains in place or something.\n\nTypically: when snake moves to a cell without food, head moves to new cell, tail moves forward (last segment removed).\n\nWhen snake moves to food, head moves to new cell with food, food is eaten, and a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, so tail doesn't move, effectively the snake grows by one.\n\nIn terms of positions: before move: positions [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nAfter move without eating: new positions [new_H, H, B1, B2, ...] and T is removed.\n\nAfter move with eating: new positions [new_H, H, B1, B2, ..., T] , so T stays, and new segment added at T? No, the new segment is added, so the tail doesn't move, and a new head is added, so the list becomes [new_head, old_head, ..., old_tail], and since tail didn't move, the segment is added.\n\nFor example, two segments: [head, tail]\n\nMove to food: head moves to new cell, eats food, so new positions: [new_head, old_head] and the tail remains? But old_head is now body, and tail was tail, but since we add a segment, it becomes [new_head, old_head, old_tail]? But old_tail should be there.\n\nStandard: with two segments [A, B] where A head, B tail.\n\nMove head to C, if C has food, then new snake: head at C, then body at A, and since grew, tail stays at B? So positions [C, A, B]\n\nYes, three segments.\n\nIf no food, move to C, new positions [C, A], B is removed.\n\nSimilarly here.\n\nSo in this case, if I move D to (1,1), which has food, so eat it, new positions: head at (1,1), then body at (1,2), and tail at (1,3). So snake: [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3)]\n\nNow, is there any danger? (1,1) is not a wall, and no collision since body at (1,2) and (1,3) are not the head position.\n\nBut tail is at (1,3), head at (1,1), so fine.\n\nNow, the other option: move R to (2,2), which has no food, I think? Food positions are (2,1), (3,1), (1,1), no (2,2), so empty cell.\n\nMove to (2,2): no food, so snake moves: head to (2,2), tail moves from (1,3) to where? After move, new positions: head at (2,2), body at (1,2). Since only two segments, tail was at (1,3), but when head moves to (2,2), the body segment moves to previous head position (1,2), and tail (1,3) is removed? Positions: before: head (1,2), tail (1,3)\n\nAfter move to (2,2) no food: new head (2,2), new body at previous head (1,2), and tail (1,3) is removed. So snake: [(2,2), (1,2)]\n\nNow, direction: since I moved R, new head direction is R.\n\nNow, compare the two options.\n\nIf I move D to (1,1), I eat food, score +1, length 3.\n\nIf I move R to (2,2), no food, length still 2.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nNow, the food at (1,1) has life span 8, so it will be there for a while, but since I can eat it now, why not?\n\nBut there is a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and newly grown tail collide.\n\nIn this case, at (1,1), is the head adjacent to tail?\n\nCurrent state: head at (1,2), tail at (1,3). Are they adjacent? Yes, vertically adjacent.\n\nBut the tail cell is (1,3), which has no food, I think. Food is at (1,1), not at tail.\n\nThe danger is when the tail cell itself has food, and head is adjacent to tail, then if I eat that food, it causes collision.\n\nHere, tail at (1,3) has no food, food is at (1,1), which is where I'm moving to.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nAfter eating, snake is at (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), with head at (1,1), direction down? I moved D to (1,1), so direction is D.\n\nNow, possible next moves from there.\n\nBut I need to plan multiple turns.\n\nThere is food at (2,1) and (3,1) nearby.\n\nAlso, (1,1) is eaten, so gone.\n\nFood positions after I eat (1,1): still (2,1) and (3,1) with life span 7, but at turn 4, life span decreases.\n\nTurn 4: for (2,1) and (3,1), life span was 7 at turn 3, so at turn 4, life span 6? Countdown decreases.\n\nAt turn 3, life span 7, so after turn 3, before turn 4, countdown=6, so at turn 4, life span 6.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) is eaten, so removed.\n\nNow, back to decision.\n\nIf I move R to (2,2), no food, snake at [(2,2), (1,2)], head at (2,2), direction R.\n\nThen, I can go to (2,1) which has food, or other directions.\n\n(2,1) is below (2,2), since D is down y-1.\n\nFrom (2,2), move D to (2,1) to eat food.\n\nBut let's think long-term.\n\nThere is also food at (3,1), which is to the right.\n\nBut I need to avoid risks.\n\nFirst, the grid: walls at borders and (5,6).\n\nAvailable space: I should consider the map.\n\nx from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (5,6) obstacle.\n\nSo cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 are playable, except (5,6) blocked.\n\nx=0 and x=7 walls, so x=1 to 6 are inner.\n\nSimilarly y=1 to 6.\n\ny=0 and y=7 walls, so y from 1 to 6? y=0 bottom wall, y=7 top wall, so y from 1 to 6.\n\nSimilarly x from 1 to 6.\n\nBut (5,6) is an obstacle, so not accessible.\n\nSnake at (1,2) and (1,3).\n\nFood at (2,1), (3,1), and (1,1) but I might eat it.\n\n(1,1) is at bottom-left area.\n\nIf I eat (1,1), I'm at (1,1) with longer snake.\n\nThen from (1,1), I can move to adjacent cells.\n\nPossible moves from (1,1): U (up to (1,2)), R (right to (2,1)), D down but y=0 is wall, cannot, L left x=0 wall cannot.\n\nSo only U or R.\n\nBut U to (1,2) is where the body is? After eating, positions: head (1,1), body (1,2), tail (1,3).\n\nSo (1,2) is occupied by body, so if I move U to (1,2), I would collide with my own body.\n\nBecause (1,2) is a body segment, not the tail in a way that moves.\n\nRule: body collision if head touches any body segment.\n\nExcept that moving into the tail cell is ok because tail moves, but only if it's the tail segment.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (1,2), which is a body segment, not the tail, so it would be a collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to any cell occupied by body except the tail.\n\nHere, from head at (1,1), moving U to (1,2) is occupied by body, so collision.\n\nMoving R to (2,1) is possible, and (2,1) has food.\n\n(2,1) has food, so I can eat it.\n\nSo from (1,1), only possible move is R to (2,1), since U is body, D and L are walls.\n\nD to (1,0) is y=0 wall, L to (0,1) x=0 wall.\n\nSo only R to (2,1).\n\nThen I eat the food at (2,1), so grow again.\n\nNew positions: head to (2,1), eat, so new snake: head (2,1), body (1,1), body (1,2), tail (1,3)? After move from (1,1) to (2,1) with eat.\n\nPrevious positions: head (1,1), body (1,2), tail (1,3)\n\nMove head to (2,1), eat food, so grow: new head (2,1), then body at previous head (1,1), and since grew, tail stays, so body (1,2) and tail (1,3) remain? No.\n\nWhen growing, the tail doesn't move, so the segments are: new head, then the previous head becomes body, and the previous body and tail remain, but since we add a segment, the tail position stays.\n\nPositions before move: [ (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) ] with (1,1) head.\n\nMove head to (2,1), eat food, so new positions: [ (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) ] because the tail (1,3) doesn't move, and we add a new segment effectively.\n\nSnake now has four segments: head (2,1), then (1,1), (1,2), tail (1,3).\n\nNow, from here, head at (2,1), I can move to adjacent cells.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,2), R to (3,1), D to (2,0) wall, L to (1,1) but (1,1) is body, collision.\n\nSo only U or R.\n\n(3,1) has food, so if I move R to (3,1), I eat it, grow to length 5.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nBack to the initial choice.\n\nIf at turn 3, I move D to (1,1), eat food, then at turn 4, I must move R to (2,1) to eat that food, etc.\n\nBut after that, I might be stuck in the corner.\n\nFor example, after eating (2,1), snake at (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3).\n\nThen from (2,1), I can move R to (3,1) to eat, or U to (2,2).\n\nIf I move R to (3,1), eat, grow to length 5: head (3,1), then (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), tail (1,3).\n\nThen from (3,1), I can move U to (3,2), or R to (4,1), or L to (2,1) but (2,1) is body, collision, D wall.\n\nSo U or R.\n\nIf I move U to (3,2), no food, then snake moves, tail moves from (1,3) to (1,2)? After move, head to (3,2), tail moves: since no eat, tail moves, so positions: head (3,2), then (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), and (1,2) is removed? Positions: before move: head (3,1), body (2,1), body (1,1), tail (1,3)? Let's list: after eating at (3,1), positions: [ (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) ]? Earlier I had [ (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) ] before moving to (3,1).\n\nAfter move to (3,1) with eat: new head (3,1), previous head (2,1) becomes body, and since grow, tail (1,3) stays, so body: (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), tail (1,3). So [ (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) ]\n\nNow move U to (3,2) no food: head to (3,2), then body: previous head positions except tail removed? Standard: when no eat, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to previous position of the next, tail is removed.\n\nSo positions: new head (3,2), then the first body segment moves to previous head (3,1), second body to (2,1), third to (1,1), and tail (1,3) is removed, but the segments are: index 0: head (3,1), index 1: (2,1), index 2: (1,1), index 3: (1,2), index 4: tail (1,3)\n\nAfter moving head to (3,2), new positions: head (3,2), then body at (3,1), then (2,1), then (1,1), and the last segment (1,2) is the new tail? Since no grow, the tail segment is removed, but the positions shift.\n\nNew head at (3,2), then the segment that was at index 1 moves to where index 0 was, which is (3,1), segment index 2 moves to where index 1 was, (2,1), segment index 3 moves to where index 2 was, (1,1), and segment index 4 (tail) is removed. So new positions: [ (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1) ] with tail at (1,1)? Index 3 was (1,2), which moves to (1,1)? Let's trace:\n\n- New head: (3,2)\n\n- Body segment that was at (3,1) moves to (3,1)? No: the body segment that was behind head moves to the head's old position.\n\nThe segment that was at position index 1, which is (2,1), moves to the position where index 0 was, which is (3,1).\n\nSimilarly, segment index 2, (1,1), moves to where index 1 was, (2,1).\n\nSegment index 3, (1,2), moves to where index 2 was, (1,1).\n\nAnd segment index 4, (1,3), is removed.\n\nSo new positions: head (3,2), body (3,1), body (2,1), tail (1,1).\n\n(1,1) is now tail.\n\nBut (1,1) was a position, but now tail is there.\n\nFrom (3,2), I can move to other places.\n\nBut in this path, by moving D at turn 3, I eat (1,1), then forced to eat (2,1) at turn 4, then if I eat (3,1) at turn 5, I have a long snake in the bottom row, which might be risky for future moves.\n\nFor example, from (3,1) after eating, if I have positions, I might be able to move up.\n\nBut let's see the other initial choice.\n\nAt turn 3, instead of moving D, I move R to (2,2).\n\nThen at turn 3: move R to (2,2), no food, so snake: head (2,2), body (1,2), tail was (1,3) removed, so positions [(2,2), (1,2)]\n\nDirection now R.\n\nThen at turn 4, from (2,2), I can move to adjacent cells.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,3), D to (2,1), L to (1,2) but (1,2) is body, collision, R to (3,2).\n\nAlso, current direction R, so cannot move L (opposite).\n\nSo possible: U, D, R.\n\nNow, (2,1) has food, so I can move D to (2,1) to eat.\n\nOr move U to (2,3) or R to (3,2).\n\nIf I move D to (2,1), eat food, grow to length 3: positions: head (2,1), body (2,2), tail (1,2)? Before move: head (2,2), body (1,2)\n\nMove to (2,1) with eat: new head (2,1), body at previous head (2,2), and since grow, tail stays, so body (1,2) remains? New positions: [ (2,1), (2,2), (1,2) ]\n\nThen from (2,1), I can move to (2,0) wall, (1,1) but (1,1) may have food or not, (1,1) has food, but (1,1) is at (1,1), adjacent to (2,1) is left, but L to (1,1), or U to (2,2) but (2,2) is body, collision, or R to (3,1) which has food.\n\nSo from (2,1), possible moves: L to (1,1), or R to (3,1), since U to (2,2) body, D wall.\n\nBoth (1,1) and (3,1) have food.\n\nBut if I move L to (1,1), eat, grow, but then I might be in corner.\n\nSimilarly, move R to (3,1) eat.\n\nBut let's think about the food life span.\n\nAll food has high life span, so no urgency.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should eat all, but need to survive.\n\nAnother thing: if I eat all food quickly, I grow long, and might trap myself.\n\nFor example, with a long snake, it's harder to move.\n\nBut here, the grid is 6x6 playable area minus obstacle, so 36 -1 =35 cells, but snake can be up to that.\n\nBut with obstacles.\n\nCurrently only two segments.\n\nI should avoid eating immediately if it leads to dead end.\n\nIn the first choice, moving D to (1,1) forces me to eat and grow in the bottom row, with tail at (1,3), and I have to move right, eating (2,1) and (3,1), then from (3,1) I can move up to (3,2), but then I have the body in the bottom row.\n\nFor example, after eating (3,1), positions [ (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) ] if I ate all, but when I move from (2,1) to (3,1), I eat, so positions as above.\n\nThen from (3,1), I can move U to (3,2), no food, then positions become [ (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2) ] with tail at (1,2), since (1,3) removed.\n\nThen from (3,2), I can move to (3,3), (4,2), etc., but the bottom row has body segments, so if I go up, I might be able to explore, but the snake is long, and the area is small.\n\nWith internal obstacle at (5,6), which is near top-right.\n\ny=6 is high y, since y up.\n\n(5,6) is x=5,y=6.\n\nNow, the food at (3,1) has life span 7 at turn 3, so at turn 4, life span 6, etc., so it lasts until turn 9 or so.\n\nSimilarly, I don't need to eat immediately.\n\nPerhaps at turn 3, moving R to (2,2) is better, so I don't go to the corner.\n\nThen from (2,2), I can move U to (2,3) or D to (2,1) to eat, or R to (3,2).\n\nIf I move U to (2,3), no food, then snake to [(2,3), (2,2)] or something.\n\nLet's plan a path.\n\nI need to think 5 turns ahead.\n\nTurn 3: current head (1,2), direction D.\n\nOptions: D to (1,1) or R to (2,2).\n\nIf I choose R to (2,2):\n\nTurn 3: move R to (2,2), no food, positions: [(2,2), (1,2)]\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 4: from (2,2), possible moves: U (to (2,3)), D (to (2,1)), R (to (3,2))\n\nCannot L, opposite direction.\n\nNow, (2,1) has food, but if I move D to (2,1), I eat and grow, but then I am at (2,1), with body at (2,2) and (1,2), so from (2,1), only L to (1,1) or R to (3,1), both food, but eating either might lead to corner.\n\nIf I move U to (2,3) at turn 4, no food, positions: head to (2,3), body to (2,2), tail (1,2) removed, so [(2,3), (2,2)]\n\nDirection U.\n\nThen from (2,3), I can move U to (2,4), D to (2,2) but body, collision, L to (1,3), R to (3,3).\n\nCurrent direction U, so cannot D (opposite).\n\nSo possible: U to (2,4), L to (1,3), R to (3,3).\n\n(1,3) is where the tail was, but now empty, no food.\n\nSimilarly, no food at (2,4) or (3,3) mentioned.\n\nFood are at (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), all low y.\n\nAt turn 4, if I move U to (2,3), then I am away from food, but I can come back later.\n\nLife span of food: (1,1) life span 8 at turn 3, so at turn 4, life span 7? Countdown.\n\nAt turn 3: (2,1) life span 7, (3,1) life span 7, (1,1) life span 8.\n\nAfter turn 3, countdown decreases: for (2,1) and (3,1), countdown to 6, for (1,1) to 7.\n\nAt turn 4, they are still there.\n\nI can go to (2,1) later.\n\nBut from (2,3), I can move down to (2,2), but (2,2) is body, so only U, L, R.\n\nMove L to (1,3): (1,3) is empty, no food, so move to (1,3), positions: head (1,3), body (2,3), so [(1,3), (2,3)]\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen from (1,3), I can move U to (1,4), D to (1,2), L to (0,3) wall, R to (2,3) body collision.\n\nCurrent direction L, so cannot R (opposite).\n\nSo possible U or D.\n\nU to (1,4) or D to (1,2).\n\n(1,2) is where the body was, but now it might be empty.\n\nAt turn 5, from (1,3), if I move D to (1,2), no food, positions: head (1,2), body (1,3), so [(1,2), (1,3)]\n\nThen I am back to similar position but at (1,2) with direction D.\n\nBut I wasted turns, and food life span decreased.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nMove U to (1,4) from (1,3), then to (1,5), etc., but food is at bottom, I need to go down to eat.\n\nBut life span is enough.\n\nFor example, (1,1) life span 8 at turn 3, so disappears at turn 11 or so, plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly, others at turn 10.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should eat all three food, but with survival.\n\nNow, if at turn 3 I move R to (2,2), then at turn 4 I can move D to (2,1) to eat.\n\nThen at turn 4, head at (2,1), with body (2,2) and (1,2), so positions [(2,1), (2,2), (1,2)]\n\nFrom (2,1), I can move L to (1,1) or R to (3,1), both food.\n\nSay I move R to (3,1) to eat.\n\nThen positions: head to (3,1), eat, grow, new positions: [ (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (1,2) ]\n\nThen from (3,1), I can move U to (3,2) or R to (4,1), etc.\n\nMove U to (3,2), no food, positions: head (3,2), body (3,1), body (2,1), tail (2,2)? After move no eat: head (3,2), body at (3,1), then (2,1), and (1,2) removed, so [ (3,2), (3,1), (2,1) ] with tail at (2,1)? Segment that was at (2,1) moves to (3,1), segment at (2,2) moves to (2,1), so [ (3,2), (3,1), (2,1) ] tail at (2,1).\n\nThen from (3,2), I can move to (3,3), (4,2), (2,2), etc.\n\n(2,2) is empty now, so I can move L to (2,2) or U to (3,3), R to (4,2), D to (3,1) body.\n\nCurrent direction U, so cannot D.\n\nSo possible L, U, R.\n\nThen I can explore the board.\n\nBut I still have food at (1,1) uneaten.\n\nFrom (3,2), I can move L to (2,2), then to (1,2), then to (1,1) to eat, but (1,2) might be free.\n\nBut the snake is shorter if I didn't eat all.\n\nIn this case, if at turn 3 I move R, then at turn 4 move D to eat (2,1), then turn 5 move R to eat (3,1), then turn 6 move U to (3,2), then turn 7 move L to (2,2), then turn 8 move L to (1,2), then turn 9 move D to (1,1) to eat, but at turn 9, (1,1) life span was 8 at turn 3, so at turn 9, countdown? At turn 3, life span 8, countdown 8, after turn 3:7, turn4:6, turn5:5, turn6:4, turn7:3, turn8:2, turn9:1, so at turn 9 it is still there, countdown 1, after turn 9 it disappears.\n\nSo I can eat at turn 9.\n\nBut I ate two food, and will eat the third.\n\nBut the snake is longer, which might be riskier.\n\nAt turn 3, if I move D to (1,1), I eat immediately, then turn 4 move R to (2,1) eat, turn 5 move R to (3,1) eat, then turn 6 move U to (3,2), etc., same as above but I ate faster.\n\nIn both cases, I eat all three food by around turn 6 or so.\n\nBut with the first approach, when I move D at turn 3, I am at (1,1) with longer snake, and fewer moves to escape the bottom row.\n\nWith move R at turn 3, I am at (2,2), then I can choose to eat or not.\n\nBut in terms of risk, moving to (1,1) might be riskier because it's a corner.\n\nFor example, after eating all three, if I am at (3,1) with snake along bottom, and I move up, it's fine.\n\nBut there might be other food or risks.\n\nCurrently only three food, but more might spawn? No, the state doesn't say food spawns, only the given food.\n\nThe state has only these food, no mention of new food spawning, so only these three to eat.\n\nTo maximize score, I need to eat all, since all +1.\n\nBut I need to survive after that.\n\nBut the game might continue with no food, or something, but probably I should eat all and then survive as long as possible, but with walls and obstacle, I can circle around.\n\nBut let's see the grid size.\n\nPlayable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, minus (5,6) obstacle, so 6x6=36 minus 1 = 35 cells.\n\nSnake can grow to 35, but with length 2, I can eat 3 food to grow to 5.\n\nThen I have plenty of space.\n\nBut to survive long-term, I should avoid dead ends.\n\nAt turn 3, moving to (1,1) is a bit cornered, while (2,2) is more central.\n\nAlso, there is the tail reward danger, but not applicable here.\n\nAnother thing: food can spawn under body, but here no such thing.\n\nSo for long-term, moving R to (2,2) might be better, as it keeps me in open space.\n\nThen at turn 4, I can move to (2,1) to eat or move away.\n\nIf I move to (2,1) at turn 4, I eat, but then I am at (2,1) with body at (2,2) and (1,2), so I can only move to (1,1) or (3,1), both food.\n\nIf I move to (3,1), I eat, grow, then I can move up.\n\nTo eat (1,1) later, I need to go back, but with longer snake, it might be harder.\n\nFor example, from (3,1) after eating, positions [ (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (1,2) ], then if I move U to (3,2), positions [ (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2) ] tail at (2,2)? After move no eat: head (3,2), body (3,1), body (2,1), tail (2,2).\n\n(1,2) removed.\n\nThen from (3,2), I can move L to (2,2), but (2,2) is tail, so moving to tail cell is ok, as long as it moves.\n\nMove to (2,2): head to (2,2), which is current tail, so after move, new head (2,2), and tail moves to previous position or something.\n\nPositions before move: [ (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2) ] with (2,2) tail.\n\nMove head to (2,2): but (2,2) is occupied by tail, so I move to that cell.\n\nSince it's the tail, it is safe, because the tail will move.\n\nAfter move, new head at (2,2), and the tail segment moves away.\n\nSpecifically, when head moves to (2,2), which was tail, then new positions: head (2,2), then the segment that was at (3,2) becomes body at (3,2)? Standard: the segments move.\n\nHead moves to new cell, here (2,2), but (2,2) was occupied by tail, so the head occupies it, and the tail moves to the next position.\n\nPositions: index 0: (3,2) head, index 1: (3,1), index 2: (2,1), index 3: (2,2) tail.\n\nMove head to (2,2), which is where index 3 is.\n\nSince no eat, new head at (2,2), then index 1 moves to index 0 position (3,2)? No.\n\nThe segment at index 1 moves to where index 0 was, (3,2).\n\nSegment at index 2 moves to where index 1 was, (3,1).\n\nSegment at index 3 moves to where index 2 was, (2,1).\n\nThen the new tail is at (2,1).\n\nNew positions: [ (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1) ] with tail at (2,1).\n\nHead at (2,2), which was the old tail position.\n\nNo collision.\n\nThen from (2,2), I can move to other cells.\n\nBut to reach (1,1), I need to move left.\n\nFrom (2,2), move L to (1,2), but (1,2) may be free.\n\nThen to (1,1).\n\nBut it takes turns.\n\nIf at turn 4, after moving R to (2,2) at turn 3, I move U to (2,3) instead of D to (2,1).\n\nThen at turn 4, positions: head (2,3), body (2,2), so [(2,3), (2,2)]\n\nThen at turn 5, I can move U to (2,4), L to (1,3), R to (3,3), etc.\n\nThen I can later go down to eat the food.\n\nFor example, move to (2,1) at some point.\n\nBut the food at (2,1) has life span 7 at turn 3, so at turn 5, countdown: turn 3:7, after turn3:6, turn4:5, turn5:4, so still there.\n\nSimilarly, I can eat it later.\n\nBut by moving away, I might miss the opportunity if life span is short, but here it's long.\n\nTo maximize score, eating sooner is better, but for survival, not necessary.\n\nBut since all food is positive, eating all is the goal.\n\nBut with the snake longer, it might be harder to maneuver, but here only 3 food, from length 2 to 5, in 35 cells, no problem.\n\nThe risk is in the corner.\n\nSo to avoid the corner, at turn 3, moving R to (2,2) is safer.\n\nThen from there, I can decide to eat or not.\n\nBut at turn 4, if I move D to (2,1), I eat and grow, but I am at (2,1), which is not as cornered as (1,1).\n\nFrom (2,1), I can move to (3,1) to eat or to (1,1), but (1,1) is corner.\n\nIf I move to (3,1), I am at (3,1), then can move up.\n\nThen (1,1) is left, which I can eat later by going left.\n\nBut with longer snake, it might be ok.\n\nPerhaps the best is to eat the food in a way that I don't trap myself.\n\nSince (1,1) is in corner, I should eat it last or when I can escape.\n\nBut with short snake, it's easier to move.\n\nAt turn 3, move R to (2,2).\n\nThen at turn 4, instead of eating, move U to (2,3) to go up.\n\nThen from (2,3), I can go to (2,4), etc., but that delays eating.\n\nBut for long-term survival, after eating all, I need to survive, so I should eat when it's safe.\n\nBut here, no immediate danger.\n\nAnother idea: I can eat (2,1) or (3,1) first, avoiding (1,1) for now.\n\nBut (1,1) has longer life span, 8 vs 7, so I can eat it later.\n\nLet's decide.\n\nI think for turn 3, moving R to (2,2) is better.\n\nThen for turn 4, from (2,2), I can move to (2,1) to eat, or to (3,2) or (2,3).\n\nIf I move to (2,1), I eat, then I have to deal with the position.\n\nBut let's think 5 turns.\n\nTurn 3: move R to (2,2)\n\nThen turn 4: move U to (2,3)  (avoid eating for now)\n\nPositions: head (2,3), body (2,2), so [(2,3), (2,2)]\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 5: from (2,3), move U to (2,4)\n\nPositions: head (2,4), body (2,3), so [(2,4), (2,3)]\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 6: from (2,4), move U to (2,5)\n\nPositions: [(2,5), (2,4)]\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 7: from (2,5), move U to (2,6)\n\nBut y=6, is it wall? y=7 is top wall, so y=6 is playable, since y from 1 to 6.\n\ny=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 to 6 ok.\n\n(2,6) is ok, but there is obstacle at (5,6), not (2,6).\n\nSo move to (2,6), positions: [(2,6), (2,5)]\n\nThen from (2,6), I can move to (2,7) but y=7 wall, cannot, or L to (1,6), R to (3,6), D to (2,5) body.\n\nCurrent direction U, so cannot D.\n\nSo move L to (1,6) or R to (3,6).\n\nSay move R to (3,6), positions: [(3,6), (2,6)]\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut I haven't eaten any food, and life span decreases.\n\nAt turn 7, for (2,1) life span: at turn 3:7, turn4:6, turn5:5, turn6:4, turn7:3, so still there.\n\nBut I wasted turns not eating.\n\nTo maximize score, I should eat as soon as possible, but only if safe.\n\nBut here, eating is safe, just might lead to corner.\n\nBut since I can move up after eating, it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps the optimal is to eat the food not in the corner first.\n\nFor example, at turn 3, move R to (2,2).\n\nThen turn 4, move R to (3,2)  (no food at (3,2))\n\nPositions: head (3,2), body (2,2), so [(3,2), (2,2)]\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen from (3,2), I can move U to (3,3), D to (3,1) which has food, R to (4,2), L to (2,2) body.\n\nCurrent direction R, so cannot L.\n\nSo move U, D, or R.\n\nIf I move D to (3,1), eat food, grow to length 3: positions [ (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) ]\n\nThen from (3,1), I can move U to (3,2) but body, collision, R to (4,1), or L to (2,1) which has food.\n\nL to (2,1) or R to (4,1).\n\n(2,1) has food, so move L to (2,1) to eat.\n\nThen positions: head to (2,1), eat, grow, new positions: [ (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) ]\n\nThen from (2,1), I can move L to (1,1) to eat or U to (2,2) body collision, D wall.\n\nSo only L to (1,1) to eat.\n\nThen positions: head to (1,1), eat, grow, new positions: [ (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) ]\n\nThen I am at (1,1) with long snake, and only way out is to move U, but (1,2) is occupied? Positions: head (1,1), body (2,1), body (3,1), body (3,2), tail (2,2)\n\nFrom (1,1), I can only move U to (1,2), but (1,2) is not occupied? In the positions, (1,2) is not listed, so it should be empty.\n\nMove U to (1,2), no food, then positions: head (1,2), body (1,1), body (2,1), body (3,1), tail (3,2)? After move no eat: head (1,2), then body to (1,1), then to (2,1), then to (3,1), and tail (2,2) removed, so [ (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1) ] tail at (3,1).\n\nThen I can move from (1,2) to U, R, etc.\n\nSo I escaped the corner.\n\nBut it took several turns.\n\nIn all cases, I can eat all food and survive.\n\nBut to minimize risk, at turn 3, moving R to (2,2) is better than moving D to (1,1), because (1,1) is a corner.\n\nSo I think for turn 3, I should move R.\n\nThen for the next moves, I can eat the food.\n\nBut the answer format requires actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but I need to think 5+ turns ahead, but not necessarily specify all, just the immediate action based on long-term thinking.\n\nThe output should be actions starting from turn 3.\n\nSo for turn 3, action R.\n\nThen for turn 4, etc., but I think I need to output only the action for turn 3, and the AI will get new state.\n\nNo, the answer format is to output a sequence of actions for multiple turns.\n\nLook: \"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ... }\"\n\nAnd \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so I need to plan a sequence for at least 5 turns.\n\nCurrent t1=3, so I need actions for turn 3,4,5,6,7,8 at least.\n\n5 turns ahead from turn 3 means up to turn 8.\n\nTurn 3,4,5,6,7,8 is 6 turns, but from 3 to 8 is 5 steps? Turn 3 to turn 4 is one turn ahead, etc.\n\n\"Think 5+ turns ahead\" means consider the state after 5 moves.\n\nBut for output, I need to provide a sequence starting from turn 3.\n\nLet's see the format.\n\nI should provide a sequence for several turns.\n\nSince the state changes, I need to plan based on current state.\n\nBut for now, let's decide on turn 3 action.\n\nI think move R to (2,2) is better.\n\nThen for turn 4, from (2,2), I can move to (3,2) to go towards (3,1) food.\n\nOr move D to (2,1) to eat.\n\nBut to avoid the corner, move to (3,2).\n\nLet's plan a sequence.\n\nTurn 3: move R to (2,2)  // avoid corner\n\nThen turn 4: move R to (3,2)  // towards (3,1)\n\nPositions: [(3,2), (2,2)]\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 5: from (3,2), move D to (3,1) to eat food.  // since (3,1) has food\n\nMove D to (3,1), eat, grow to length 3: positions [ (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) ]\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 6: from (3,1), move R to (4,1)  // no food, move right to open space\n\nPositions: head to (4,1), no food, so new positions: head (4,1), body (3,1), tail (3,2)? Before: head (3,1), body (3,2), tail (2,2)\n\nMove to (4,1) no eat: head (4,1), body to (3,1), body to (3,2), and tail (2,2) removed, so [ (4,1), (3,1), (3,2) ] tail at (3,2)\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 7: from (4,1), move U to (4,2)  // up to explore\n\nPositions: head (4,2), body (4,1), body (3,1), tail (3,2)? After move: head (4,2), body to (4,1), body to (3,1), and tail (3,2) removed, so [ (4,2), (4,1), (3,1) ] tail at (3,1)\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 8: from (4,2), move U to (4,3)  // continue up\n\nPositions: [(4,3), (4,2), (4,1)] etc.\n\nBut I have not eaten (1,1) and (2,1) yet.\n\n(2,1) and (1,1) are still there, but life span decreasing.\n\nAt turn 8, for (2,1): life span at turn 3:7, turn4:6, turn5:5, turn6:4, turn7:3, turn8:2, so still there.\n\nSimilarly (1,1) at turn 8: countdown 3 (since initial 8, turn3:8, turn4:7, turn5:6, turn6:5, turn7:4, turn8:3)\n\nSo I can go back to eat them.\n\nFor example, from (4,3), I can move left and down to (2,1) and (1,1).\n\nBut it might take many turns, and I risk the food disappearing if I delay too much.\n\nTo eat all, I should eat (2,1) and (1,1) earlier.\n\nAt turn 4, after turn 3 move R to (2,2), move D to (2,1) to eat.\n\nThen at turn 4: move D to (2,1), eat, positions [ (2,1), (2,2), (1,2) ]\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 5: from (2,1), move R to (3,1) to eat, positions: head to (3,1), eat, grow, new positions [ (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (1,2) ]\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 6: from (3,1), move U to (3,2) no food, positions: head (3,2), body (3,1), body (2,1), tail (2,2)? After move: head (3,2), body to (3,1), body to (2,1), and (1,2) removed, so [ (3,2), (3,1), (2,1) ] tail at (2,1)\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 7: from (3,2), move U to (3,3) no food, positions: [(3,3), (3,2), (3,1)] tail at (3,1)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut (1,1) is still uneaten.\n\nThen I need to go to (1,1) from here.\n\nFor example, at turn 7, from (3,2) or (3,3), move L to (2,3) or something, then down to (1,1).\n\nBut it takes time.\n\nAt turn 5, after eating (3,1), I could move L to (2,1), but (2,1) is body, cannot.\n\nOnly U or R.\n\nSo I have to move up.\n\nThen later, from (3,2), I can move L to (2,2), then to (1,2), then to (1,1).\n\nBut (1,2) might be free.\n\nFor example, at turn 6, positions [ (3,2), (3,1), (2,1) ], tail at (2,1)\n\nMove L to (2,2)? From (3,2), move L to (2,2), no food, positions: head (2,2), body (3,2), body (3,1), tail (2,1)? After move: head (2,2), body to (3,2), body to (3,1), and tail (2,1) removed, so [ (2,2), (3,2), (3,1) ] tail at (3,1)\n\nThen from (2,2), I can move D to (2,1) but (2,1) may have food, but in this state, at turn 6, (2,1) food might be there.\n\n(2,1) has food, so move D to (2,1) to eat.\n\nThen positions: head to (2,1), eat, grow, new positions: [ (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1) ]\n\nThen from (2,1), I can move L to (1,1) to eat.\n\nThen eat (1,1), grow.\n\nSo in this sequence, I ate all three food by turn 7 or so.\n\nLet's list the sequence from turn 3.\n\nTurn 3: move R to (2,2)  // from (1,2) to (2,2)\n\nTurn 4: move D to (2,1)  // eat food at (2,1), positions: [ (2,1), (2,2), (1,2) ]\n\nTurn 5: move R to (3,1)  // eat food at (3,1), positions: [ (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (1,2) ]\n\nTurn 6: move U to (3,2)  // no food, positions: [ (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2) ]? After move no eat: head to (3,2), body to (3,1), body to (2,1), tail (1,2) removed, so [ (3,2), (3,1), (2,1) ] tail at (2,1)\n\nIn positions, (2,2) is not there, only (2,1) as tail.\n\nPositions: [ (3,2), (3,1), (2,1) ]\n\nTurn 7: from (3,2), move L to (2,2)  // no food, positions: head to (2,2), body to (3,2), body to (3,1), tail (2,1) removed, so [ (2,2), (3,2), (3,1) ] tail at (3,1)\n\nBut (2,2) has no food, and (2,1) is not occupied, but food at (2,1) might be there.\n\nAt turn 7, (2,1) food: life span at turn 3:7, turn4:6, turn5:5, turn6:4, turn7:3, so still there.\n\nFrom (2,2), I can move D to (2,1) to eat.\n\nTurn 7: move L to (2,2), but (2,2) is empty, so positions as above.\n\nThen turn 8: from (2,2), move D to (2,1) to eat food, positions: head to (2,1), eat, grow, new positions: [ (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1) ]\n\nThen turn 9: from (2,1), move L to (1,1) to eat, positions: head to (1,1), eat, grow, new positions: [ (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1) ]\n\nThen I have eaten all.\n\nBut at turn 9, (1,1) life span was 8 at turn 3, turn4:7, turn5:6, turn6:5, turn7:4, turn8:3, turn9:2, so still there.\n\nThen from (1,1), I can move U to (1,2) to escape, etc.\n\nBut it takes many turns.\n\nTo save turns, at turn 6, after [ (3,2), (3,1), (2,1) ], instead of moving U or L, I can move D to (3,1) but body, cannot, or R to (4,2), but not towards (1,1).\n\nI have to go via (2,2) or something.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n\nFor turn 3, move R.\n\nThen the sequence can be as above.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions.\n\nSince the state changes, I can output for turn 3 only, but the format requires a sequence.\n\nPerhaps for this response, I can provide a sequence based on the current state.\n\nI think for turn 3, move R is better.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score and ensure long-term survival, I have planned a sequence of moves for turns 3 to 8 (5 turns ahead) based on the current state. The key considerations are:\n- **Prioritize safety**: Avoid walls, obstacles, and body collisions. The snake starts in a corner at (1,2), so moving right (R) to (2,2) at turn 3 avoids the risky bottom-left corner and positions the snake for better mobility.\n- **Food consumption**: Eat positive food when safe, but avoid rushing to eat in corners to prevent trapping. The food at (1,1) is in a corner with a longer life span (8 turns), so it can be eaten later. Focus on eating (2,1) and (3,1) first, as they have shorter life spans (7 turns) and are less risky.\n- **Long-term path**: After eating, move upward to open space to avoid dead ends. This keeps options open for future moves and allows returning to eat (1,1) safely.\n- **Movement constraints**: Current head direction is down (D), so moving up (U) is not allowed on turn 3 (no instant reverse). On subsequent turns, avoid reverse moves where possible.\n- **Life span tracking**: Food life spans decrease each turn. At turn 3:\n  - (2,1): Life span 7, disappears after turn 9 (countdown: 7 at turn 3, 6 at turn 4, ..., 0 at turn 10, gone before turn 10).\n  - (3,1): Life span 7, same as above.\n  - (1,1): Life span 8, disappears after turn 10 (countdown: 8 at turn 3, 7 at turn 4, ..., 0 at turn 11, gone before turn 11).\n\n### Planned Moves (Turns 3 to 8):\n- **Turn 3 (t1=3)**: Move R (right) to (2,2).  \n  - Why: Avoids the corner at (1,1) and moves toward central area. Eating (1,1) now would trap the snake with limited escape routes. Moving R is safe and maintains flexibility.\n- **Turn 4 (t1+1=4)**: Move D (down) to (2,1) to eat the food.  \n  - Why: (2,1) has food with value +1. Life span is sufficient, and eating now grows the snake to length 3. The position (2,1) is less cornered than (1,1), allowing easier escape.\n- **Turn 5 (t1+2=5)**: Move R (right) to (3,1) to eat the food.  \n  - Why: (3,1) has food with value +1. Eating grows snake to length 4. Moving R continues away from the corner and toward open space.\n- **Turn 6 (t1+3=6)**: Move U (up) to (3,2).  \n  - Why: No food here, but moving up escapes the bottom row and avoids potential traps. The snake is now in a safer area with more movement options.\n- **Turn 7 (t1+4=7)**: Move L (left) to (2,2).  \n  - Why: Prepares to approach (2,1) or (1,1) later. (2,2) is empty and safe, moving L is not a reverse (previous direction was U, so L is allowed).\n- **Turn 8 (t1+5=8)**: Move D (down) to (2,1) if food is present, but since (2,1) was eaten on turn 4, it is gone. Instead, move to (1,2) or similar based on state, but for planning, assume move to (2,1) is invalid. Re-plan: From (2,2), move L to (1,2) to head toward (1,1).  \n  - Why: (1,2) is likely empty. This starts the path to eat (1,1) on a future turn.\n\n### Explanation of 5+ Turn Lookahead:\n- **Risk assessment**: Moving to (1,1) on turn 3 risks cornering the snake with a longer body, making escape harder. By delaying (1,1) consumption, the snake stays mobile and can return later when the path is clearer.\n- **Food timing**: (2,1) and (3,1) must be eaten by turn 9, which is achieved. (1,1) can be eaten by turn 10, so moving toward it on turn 8 is safe.\n- **Survival focus**: The sequence avoids walls and obstacles (e.g., (5,6) is far away). After turn 8, the snake can eat (1,1) and move upward to explore the grid, ensuring long-term play.\n- **Alternative avoided**: Moving D on turn 3 to (1,1) would eat food immediately but force the snake into a series of corner moves with high collision risk from the growing body. Score is the same (all +1 food eaten), but survival probability is lower.\n\nThis plan eats all food by turn 9, grows the snake to length 5, and maintains a safe path for continued survival.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 3: R\nTurn 4: D\nTurn 5: R\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: L\nTurn 8: L\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 4, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) is a wall corner, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let me confirm.\n\nWalls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means x from 1 to 6 and y from 1 to 6 are inside, except for internal obstacles. Internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nSnake positions: head at (2,2), body at (1,2). So the snake has two segments: head and one body part, which is the tail. Since positions are given as [(2,2), (1,2)], head is (2,2), tail is (1,2). Direction is R, which is right, so moving east.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (2,1) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (3,1) with life span 6, value 1\n\n- (1,1) with life span 7, value 1\n\n- (1,6) with life span 10, value 1\n\nAll food has value 1, so all are positive food; no negative food here.\n\nLife span: for (2,1) and (3,1), life span 6 at turn 4, so they disappear after turn 4 + 6 = turn 10? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 4, life span 6 means it has 6 turns left, including turn 4, so it will disappear after turn 9? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo, at turn t, if life span is L, it decreases to L-1 on turn t+1, and disappears when countdown reaches 0. If life span is L at turn t, it will be present for L more turns, including turn t. After turn t + L - 1, it disappears? Let's think.\n\nSuppose at turn t, food has life span L. After turn t, countdown decreases by 1, so at turn t+1, life span is L-1. It disappears when life span becomes 0, so at the start of turn when life span is 0, it's gone. So for food with life span L at turn t, it will be there until turn t + L - 1 inclusive? Let's see:\n\n- Turn t: life span L\n\n- After turn t, countdown decreases, so turn t+1: life span L-1\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn t + L - 1: life span 1\n\n- After turn t + L - 1, it decreases to 0, so at turn t + L, it's gone.\n\nSo food with life span L at turn t will disappear after turn t + L - 1, meaning it's not there at turn t + L.\n\nFor (2,1): life span 6 at turn 4, so disappears after turn 4 + 6 - 1 = turn 9? Turn t + L - 1 is the last turn it exists.\n\n- Turn 4: life span 6\n\n- Turn 5: life span 5\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn 9: life span 1 (still there)\n\n- Turn 10: life span 0, gone.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\n(3,1): same, life span 6, disappear after turn 9.\n\n(1,1): life span 7, so at turn 4, life span 7, disappears after turn 10? Turn 4 + 7 - 1 = turn 10, gone at turn 11.\n\n- Turn 4: 7\n\n- Turn 5: 6\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn 10: 1\n\n- Turn 11: 0, gone.\n\n(1,6): life span 10, disappear after turn 4 + 10 - 1 = turn 13.\n\nNow, snake is at [(2,2), (1,2)], head at (2,2), direction R (right). So current possible moves: since direction is R, I can move R (right), U (up), or D (down), but not L (left) because that would be instant reverse, opposite to current direction.\n\nCurrent direction R, so opposite is L, so cannot move L. Can move U, D, or R.\n\nNow, grid: walls at borders, so x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls. Playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nFood at (2,1), (3,1), (1,1), (1,6).\n\nSnake head at (2,2), so adjacent cells:\n\n- Up: (2,3) but y+1? Let's define coordinates. Typically, (x,y) with U: y+1, D: y-1, L: x-1, R: x+1.\n\nFrom the movement: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y)\n\nSo from (2,2):\n\n- U: (2,3)\n\n- D: (2,1)\n\n- L: (1,2) but (1,2) is the tail\n\n- R: (3,2)\n\nBut (1,2) is the tail, which is currently occupied by the snake body.\n\nNow, movement rules: I can move into the tail cell because the tail will move away, so it's safe, as long as I don't cause a collision later.\n\nAlso, food at (2,1), which is down from head.\n\n(2,1) has food, and I can move D to (2,1).\n\nBut let's see the risks.\n\nFirst, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and survive.\n\nCurrent snake length is 2, since two positions.\n\nIf I eat food, length increases by 1.\n\nFood values are all +1, so eating any gives +1 score and length +1.\n\nNow, possible moves from (2,2) at turn 4:\n\n- U to (2,3)\n\n- D to (2,1)\n\n- R to (3,2)\n\nL is not allowed because reverse.\n\nNow, (2,1) has food, so if I move D, I eat it, score +1, length becomes 3, and the new tail will be... after moving, the head moves to (2,1), and since I ate, a new segment is added, so positions become: head at (2,1), then previous head (2,2) becomes body, and tail (1,2) but since I ate, I add a segment, so snake becomes [(2,1), (2,2), (1,2)]? Let's see.\n\nStandard snake movement: when you move, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the next position, and if you eat, a new segment is added at the tail end, so tail doesn't move.\n\nMore precisely: after moving without eating, the head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail segment is removed.\n\nBut if you eat, the tail segment is not removed; instead, a new segment is added, so the tail stays, and the snake grows.\n\nIn terms of positions: suppose current positions [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nAfter move to new head position NH:\n\n- If not eat: positions become [NH, H, B1, B2, ...] and last position (T) is vacated.\n\n- If eat: positions become [NH, H, B1, B2, ..., T], so T stays, new segment added at tail.\n\nIn this case, current: [ (2,2) head, (1,2) tail ]\n\nIf I move to (2,1) and eat the food there, since (2,1) has food.\n\nThen new positions: head at (2,1), then previous head (2,2) becomes body, and tail (1,2) remains, so snake becomes [ (2,1), (2,2), (1,2) ], length 3.\n\nIf I don't eat, say move to (3,2), no food there, so head to (3,2), body to (2,2), tail (1,2) removed, so positions [ (3,2), (2,2) ], length still 2.\n\nSimilarly for other moves.\n\nNow, back to moves.\n\nFirst, option: move D to (2,1) with food.\n\nBut there's a risk: Tail Reward Danger.\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nIn this case, is the head adjacent to the tail?\n\nHead at (2,2), tail at (1,2), which are adjacent horizontally.\n\nTail cell: (1,2) has food? Currently, no food at (1,2), food is at (1,1), (2,1), etc., not at (1,2).\n\n(1,2) is the tail position, but it doesn't have food; food is elsewhere.\n\nSo, no food on tail cell, so no Tail Reward Danger here.\n\nTherefore, moving D to (2,1) should be safe and I eat the food.\n\nBut let's see the grid: (2,1) is within bounds, not a wall.\n\ny=1 is not wall, y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 is playable.\n\nSimilarly, x=2, fine.\n\nNow, other options: move U to (2,3) or R to (3,2).\n\n(2,3) has no food, I think; food positions given: (2,1), (3,1), (1,1), (1,6). So (2,3) empty.\n\n(3,2) empty.\n\n(3,1) has food, but not adjacent to head now.\n\nI need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, after moving, the direction changes.\n\nIf I move D, new head direction is D.\n\nIf U, new direction U.\n\nIf R, new direction R.\n\nNow, life span: food at (2,1) has life span 6 at turn 4, so it will be there for 6 turns, including turn 4, so disappears after turn 9. Since we're at turn 4, it has until turn 9 to be eaten.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut I can eat it now.\n\nBut I should consider long-term.\n\nThere is food at (1,1), which is close, and (3,1), etc.\n\nAlso, (1,6) is far away.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,6), which might be relevant later.\n\nNow, let's think about the board.\n\nGrid: rows y=1 to 6, columns x=1 to 6.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells (1,1) to (6,6) are playable, except (5,6) is obstacle, so not accessible.\n\n(5,6) is occupied by wall, so cannot go there.\n\nFood: (2,1) at turn 4, life span 6\n\n(3,1) life span 6\n\n(1,1) life span 7\n\n(1,6) life span 10\n\nSnake: head (2,2), tail (1,2)\n\nIf I move D to (2,1), I eat, snake becomes [ (2,1), (2,2), (1,2) ], length 3, head at (2,1), direction D.\n\nThen from there, possible moves: from (2,1), direction D, so I can move L, R, or D, not U (reverse).\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n- L: (1,1) which has food\n\n- R: (3,1) which has food\n\n- D: (2,0) but y=0 is wall, so cannot move D, out of bound.\n\ny=0 is wall, so (2,0) is invalid, wall collision.\n\nSimilarly, U: (2,2) but U is up, which is opposite to current direction D? Current direction after move is D, so moving U would be reverse, not allowed.\n\nDirections: after moving D, head is at (2,1) facing down (D).\n\nSo possible moves: since facing D, I can move L (left), R (right), or D (down), but not U (up).\n\nNow, L: (1,1) - has food, and within bounds.\n\nR: (3,1) - has food, within bounds.\n\nD: (2,0) - y=0, wall, invalid.\n\nSo I can only move L to (1,1) or R to (3,1), both have food.\n\nIf I move L to (1,1), eat food, snake grows: head to (1,1), body to (2,1), tail (2,2) and (1,2)? Positions: current before move: [ (2,1), (2,2), (1,2) ]\n\nAfter moving L to (1,1), since (1,1) has food, I eat, so new positions: head (1,1), then previous head (2,1) becomes body, then (2,2) body, and tail (1,2) remains, so [ (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (1,2) ]\n\nLength 4.\n\nBut now, head at (1,1), which is corner, and direction L (left).\n\nNow, possible moves: from (1,1), facing left.\n\nCan move U, D, L, but not R (reverse).\n\nBut x=1, y=1.\n\nL: (0,1) x=0 wall, invalid.\n\nU: (1,2) - but (1,2) is part of the body? Positions: [ (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (1,2) ], so (1,2) is the tail.\n\n(1,2) is occupied by the tail.\n\nNow, can I move to (1,2)? Since it's the tail, and if I move there, the tail will move away, so it should be safe, as long as no collision.\n\nBut let's see: if I move U to (1,2), which is the tail position.\n\nAfter moving, head to (1,2), and since I didn't eat (no food at (1,2)? (1,2) may or may not have food, but in this case, (1,2) is occupied by snake, so even if food was there, I can't eat it unless I move away and come back, but since it's under body, I can't eat now.\n\nCurrently, (1,2) has no food; food is at other places.\n\nBut when I move to (1,2), since it's the tail, and tail moves, but in this case, if I move to tail position without eating, the tail moves away, so it's empty.\n\nBut here, I'm moving to (1,2), which is current tail position.\n\nAfter move: head moves to (1,2), then the body segments move: (2,1) moves to previous head position (1,1)? Standard: when moving, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo from positions [ (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (1,2) ] before move.\n\nIf I move head to new position, say (1,2), but (1,2) is currently tail.\n\nIf I move to (1,2), and there is no food there (assume), then after move: head to (1,2), then body: (2,1) moves to (1,1), (2,2) moves to (2,1), and tail (1,2) is removed? Positions: current: head (1,1), body1 (2,1), body2 (2,2), tail (1,2)\n\nAfter moving head to (1,2): new head at (1,2), then body1 moves to previous head position (1,1), body2 moves to previous body1 position (2,1), and tail (1,2) is... since head moved to (1,2), which was tail, but tail is removed if not eaten.\n\nGenerally, the cell that was tail is vacated unless eaten.\n\nSo after move to (1,2) without eating: new positions: head at (1,2), body at (1,1) (previous head), body at (2,1) (previous body1), and the last body (2,2) becomes the new tail? Let's list:\n\nPrevious positions: index 0: head (1,1), 1: (2,1), 2: (2,2), 3: (1,2) tail\n\nAfter moving head to new position (1,2): new head at (1,2)\n\nThen segment 1 moves to previous position of segment 0, which was (1,1)\n\nSegment 2 moves to previous position of segment 1, which was (2,1)\n\nSegment 3 (tail) moves to previous position of segment 2, which was (2,2)\n\nBut segment 3 was at (1,2), and it moves to (2,2).\n\nSo new positions: head at (1,2), then body at (1,1), body at (2,1), tail at (2,2)\n\nSo [ (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2) ]\n\nNow, (1,2) was the tail, but now it's head, and the new tail is at (2,2).\n\nIn this case, no problem.\n\nBut back to the point, from (1,1) facing left, I can move U to (1,2), which is now empty or will be.\n\nD: (1,0) y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nL: (0,1) wall invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is U to (1,2).\n\nThen from there, head at (1,2), facing U (since I moved up).\n\nThen from (1,2), I can move U to (1,3), L to (0,2) invalid, R to (2,2), but (2,2) is part of body? In new positions, (2,2) is tail, so I can move to it since tail will move.\n\nBut let's not get too far.\n\nIf from (2,1) after eating (2,1), I move R to (3,1) instead.\n\nSimilar situation.\n\nBut let's go back to turn 4.\n\nAt turn 4, if I move D to (2,1), I eat, grow to length 3, head at (2,1) dir D.\n\nThen I have to move either L to (1,1) or R to (3,1), both have food.\n\nSay I move L to (1,1), eat again, grow to length 4, head at (1,1) dir L.\n\nThen only move U to (1,2), no food there, so move to (1,2), no eat, positions become [ (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2) ] as above, head at (1,2) dir U.\n\nThen from (1,2), I can move U to (1,3), or R to (2,2), which is tail, safe, or L invalid.\n\nIf I move U to (1,3), no food, etc.\n\nBut there is food at (1,6), which is far.\n\nBut let's see the other option at turn 4.\n\nIf I don't move D, but move U to (2,3).\n\nMove U to (2,3): no food there, so no eat, snake moves: head to (2,3), body to (2,2), tail (1,2) removed, so new positions [ (2,3), (2,2) ], length 2, head at (2,3) dir U.\n\nThen from (2,3), possible moves: U to (2,4), D to (2,2) but D is down, opposite to current U, so not allowed? Current direction U, so cannot move D.\n\nCan move U, L, or R.\n\nL: (1,3), R: (3,3), U: (2,4)\n\nAll empty, no food nearby except (1,6) but far.\n\nFood at (1,6), life span 10, so plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly, if I move R from turn 4 to (3,2): no food, so head to (3,2), body to (2,2), tail removed, positions [ (3,2), (2,2) ], dir R.\n\nThen from (3,2), can move U to (3,3), D to (3,1) which has food, or R to (4,2), etc.\n\n(3,1) has food, so I could move D to eat it.\n\nBut let's think long-term.\n\nI need to maximize score, so eating food is good, but I have to avoid getting trapped.\n\nAlso, with length 2, I have more space.\n\nIf I eat both (2,1) and (1,1) or (3,1), I grow to length 4 quickly, but then I'm in the bottom-left corner with less room to maneuver.\n\nFor example, after eating (2,1) and then (1,1), I'm at (1,1) with body around, and only way out is up to (1,2), then I can go to (1,3), (1,4), etc., but it might be a dead end if I go up.\n\nSimilarly, if I eat (3,1), I can go right or up.\n\nBut let's list all food and their expiration.\n\nFood at (2,1): disappears after turn 9 (life span 6 at turn 4, last at turn 9)\n\n(3,1): same, after turn 9\n\n(1,1): life span 7 at turn 4, so last at turn 10 (since turn 4+7-1=10)\n\n(1,6): life span 10, last at turn 13.\n\nAt turn 4, I can choose to eat (2,1) now or later.\n\nBut if I don't eat now, I might eat other things.\n\nAlso, there might be new food spawning, but the state doesn't say anything about new food, so I think only these foods are present, and no new food mentioned, so only these four.\n\nI need to plan a path to eat as many as possible without dying.\n\nCurrent position: head at (2,2).\n\nIf I move U to (2,3), then I can go to (2,4), (2,5), etc., towards (1,6).\n\n(1,6) is at top-left, y=6 is top since y=7 wall.\n\ny=6 is the top row.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) is left top.\n\nFrom (2,2), move U to (2,3), then I can go up to (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), then left to (1,6) to eat the food there.\n\nBut (2,6) to (1,6) is left, or from (2,6) I can go to (1,6).\n\nBut (1,6) has food.\n\nAlso, there is obstacle at (5,6), so row y=6, x=5 is blocked.\n\nBut (1,6) is at x=1,y=6.\n\nFrom (2,2) to (2,6) is 4 moves up, then to (1,6) one move left, so 5 moves to reach (1,6).\n\nAt turn 4, move to (2,3) turn 5, (2,4) turn 6, (2,5) turn 7, (2,6) turn 8, then to (1,6) turn 9.\n\n(1,6) life span 10, last at turn 13, so at turn 9 it's still there, life span at turn 4 is 10, so turn 5:9, turn6:8, turn7:7, turn8:6, turn9:5, so yes, at turn 9 it has life span 5, still there.\n\nSimilarly, other foods: (2,1) last at turn 9, so at turn 9 it disappears? Turn 9 is the last turn it exists.\n\nAt turn 9, if I'm at (2,6), I can go to (1,6) to eat it.\n\nBut (2,1) is at bottom, I might not be able to eat it if I go up.\n\nSimilarly, (3,1) and (1,1) have until turn 10.\n\n(1,1) last at turn 10.\n\nIf I go to (1,6) by turn 9, eat it, then I can come down to eat (1,1) or others, but time is short.\n\nFor example, from (1,6) after eating, head at (1,6), then I need to go down to (1,5), (1,4), etc. to (1,1).\n\nFrom (1,6) to (1,1) is 5 moves down, so at turn 10 I can be at (1,1) if I go directly, but at turn 9 I eat at (1,6), so positions: after eating (1,6) at turn 9, head at (1,6), length increases.\n\nThen turn 10: move to (1,5), no food, turn 11: to (1,4), no, etc, to reach (1,1) at turn 14? Let's calculate.\n\nTurn 9: head at (1,6) after eating.\n\nThen move down: turn 10: to (1,5), no food\n\nTurn 11: to (1,4), no\n\nTurn 12: to (1,3), no\n\nTurn 13: to (1,2), no\n\nTurn 14: to (1,1), but (1,1) disappears after turn 10, so at turn 11 it's gone, so I can't eat it.\n\n(1,1) life span 7 at turn 4, so:\n\nTurn 4: span 7\n\nTurn 5: 6\n\nTurn 6: 5\n\nTurn 7: 4\n\nTurn 8: 3\n\nTurn 9: 2\n\nTurn 10: 1 (still there)\n\nTurn 11: 0, gone.\n\nSo last chance to eat (1,1) is turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) and (3,1) last at turn 9.\n\nTurn 9: span 1 for (2,1) and (3,1), since turn 4:6, turn5:5, turn6:4, turn7:3, turn8:2, turn9:1, turn10:0 gone.\n\n(1,1): turn10:1, turn11:0 gone.\n\n(1,6): turn4:10, turn5:9, ..., turn13:1, turn14:0 gone.\n\nNow, back to plan: if I go up to eat (1,6) first, I can reach by turn 9 and eat it.\n\nThen from there, I can try to eat (1,1), but (1,1) must be eaten by turn 10.\n\nFrom (1,6) at turn 9, I can move directly down to (1,5) turn 10, but (1,5) has no food, and (1,1) is at turn 10, but I'm at (1,5) turn 10, not at (1,1).\n\nTo reach (1,1) from (1,6) in one move? Impossible, distance is 5 cells, each move one cell, so minimum 5 moves from (1,6) to (1,1).\n\nAt turn 9 I'm at (1,6), turn 10 move to (1,5), turn 11 to (1,4), etc., so I reach (1,1) at turn 14, but it's gone at turn 11, so I can't eat it.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1) and (3,1) are gone by turn 10, so I can't eat them if I go up first.\n\nTherefore, if I prioritize (1,6), I miss the bottom foods.\n\nBut (1,6) has longer life, so I can eat it later.\n\nBetter to eat the bottom foods first since they expire sooner.\n\n(2,1) and (3,1) expire after turn 9, (1,1) after turn 10, (1,6) after turn 13.\n\nSo eat (2,1) and (3,1) soon.\n\nAt turn 4, I can eat (2,1) by moving D.\n\nThen I have to eat (3,1) or (1,1) next.\n\nAfter eating (2,1), head at (2,1) dir D.\n\nThen I can move R to (3,1) to eat it, or L to (1,1).\n\nIf I move R to (3,1), eat, snake grows to length 4, head at (3,1) dir R (since I moved right).\n\nThen from (3,1), facing R, can move U to (3,2), R to (4,1), or D to (3,0) invalid, so U or R.\n\n(3,2) is empty, I think.\n\nThen I can go to (1,1) later, but (1,1) is at (1,1), from (3,1) I need to go left to (2,1), but (2,1) is occupied? After eating (3,1), positions: let's trace.\n\nTurn 4: move D to (2,1), eat, positions [ (2,1), (2,2), (1,2) ]\n\nTurn 5: move R to (3,1), eat, so new head (3,1), body (2,1), body (2,2), tail (1,2), so [ (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (1,2) ], length 4, dir R.\n\nNow, (1,1) is still there, with food.\n\nFrom (3,1), I can move L to (2,1), but (2,1) is occupied by body, so I cannot move there, collision with body.\n\n(2,1) is a body segment, so moving to (2,1) would be head touching body, die.\n\nSimilarly, U to (3,2), empty.\n\nR to (4,1), empty.\n\nD invalid.\n\nSo only U or R.\n\nSay move U to (3,2), no food, so head to (3,2), body to (3,1), body to (2,1), tail (2,2) or what? Positions: before move, [ (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (1,2) ]\n\nAfter move to (3,2) no eat: head to (3,2), body1 to (3,1), body2 to (2,1), tail to (2,2), so [ (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2) ], and (1,2) vacated.\n\nNow head at (3,2) dir U.\n\nThen I can move to (3,3), (2,2) but (2,2) is body, or (4,2).\n\n(2,2) is occupied, so cannot move there.\n\nMove to (3,3) or (4,2) or (3,1) but (3,1) is body, cannot.\n\nCurrent direction U, so can move U, L, R.\n\nL: (2,2) occupied, invalid.\n\nR: (4,2) empty.\n\nU: (3,3) empty.\n\nD: down, opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo move to (3,3) or (4,2).\n\nBut (1,1) is at (1,1), which is far, and I need to eat it by turn 10.\n\nAt turn 5, after eating (3,1), I'm at (3,1).\n\nTurn 6: move to (3,2) as above.\n\nThen from (3,2), say move R to (4,2), head to (4,2), dir R, then I can go to (4,3), etc., but (1,1) is at bottom left.\n\nTo reach (1,1) from (4,2) at turn 6, I need to go left and down.\n\nBut with snake length 4, it might be tight.\n\nFor example, from (4,2), move L to (3,2), but (3,2) is occupied? At turn 6, positions after move to (4,2): from previous [ (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2) ]? After turn 5 move to (3,2): positions [ (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2) ]\n\nTurn 6 move to (4,2): head to (4,2), body to (3,2), body to (3,1), tail to (2,1), so [ (4,2), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1) ]\n\nThen (2,2) vacated.\n\nNow from (4,2), can move L to (3,2) but occupied, invalid; U to (4,3); D to (4,1); R to (5,2).\n\nD to (4,1): (4,1) may be empty.\n\nBut to go to (1,1), I need to go left.\n\nMove L to (3,2) invalid, so I have to move U, D, or R.\n\nSay move D to (4,1), if possible.\n\n(4,1) empty, I assume.\n\nThen head to (4,1), dir D.\n\nThen from (4,1), can move L to (3,1), but (3,1) is body, invalid; R to (5,1); D invalid; U to (4,2) occupied, invalid.\n\nPositions: before move to (4,1), positions [ (4,2), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1) ]\n\nAfter move to (4,1): head (4,1), body (4,2), body (3,2), tail (3,1), so [ (4,1), (4,2), (3,2), (3,1) ], (2,1) vacated.\n\nFrom (4,1), facing D, can move L to (3,1) but (3,1) is body, invalid; R to (5,1); U to (4,2) occupied, invalid; D invalid.\n\nSo only R to (5,1).\n\nThen to (5,1), and so on, I'm going right, away from (1,1).\n\nTo reach (1,1), I need to go left from (3,1) or something, but it's occupied.\n\nFrom the state after turn 5, at (3,1), I could move L, but (2,1) is body, cannot.\n\nSo I cannot go back to (1,1) easily because the body blocks the way.\n\nAt turn 5, after eating (3,1), positions [ (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (1,2) ], so (1,1) is adjacent at left, but I cannot move to (2,1) or (1,2) to reach it; (1,1) is empty, but from (3,1), I can only move to (3,2) or (4,1), not directly to (2,1) or (1,1).\n\n(1,1) is at (1,1), which is not adjacent to (3,1); (3,1) is adjacent to (2,1), (4,1), (3,2), (3,0 invalid).\n\n(2,1) is body, so no direct way to (1,1).\n\nThe only way is to move to (3,2), then to (2,2), but (2,2) may be occupied.\n\nAt turn 5, positions [ (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (1,2) ], so (2,2) is body.\n\nFrom (3,1), move U to (3,2), which is empty, then at (3,2), I can move L to (2,2), but (2,2) is body, invalid; or U to (3,3), etc.\n\nCannot move to (2,2) because it's occupied.\n\nAfter some moves, when the tail moves, it might free up space.\n\nFor example, at turn 6, after moving to (3,2), positions [ (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2) ], (1,2) vacated.\n\n(2,2) is still occupied.\n\nFrom (3,2), move to (3,3), then positions [ (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1) ], (2,2) vacated.\n\nNow at turn 7, head at (3,3), can move to (2,3), (3,4), (4,3), etc.\n\n(2,1) is at (2,1), but I'm at (3,3), not close.\n\n(1,1) is at (1,1), I can try to go to (2,1), which is tail in this case, but (2,1) is occupied.\n\nAt turn 7, positions [ (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1) ], so (2,1) is tail.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can move D to (3,2) but (3,2) is body, invalid; L to (2,3); U to (3,4); R to (4,3).\n\nSo move L to (2,3), then to (2,2) or something, but (2,2) is empty now.\n\nSay turn 7 move to (2,3), positions [ (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) ], tail (2,1) vacated? After move to (2,3): head (2,3), body (3,3), body (3,2), tail (3,1), so [ (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) ], (2,1) vacated.\n\nThen from (2,3), can move D to (2,2), L to (1,3), U to (2,4), etc.\n\n(2,2) is empty, so I can move D to (2,2), then from there to (2,1) or (1,2), etc.\n\nBut (2,1) is empty, and food at (1,1) and (2,1) is gone, only (1,1) left until turn 10.\n\nAt turn 7, (1,1) still there, span at turn 7: from turn 4 span 7, turn 5:6, turn 6:5, turn 7:4, so yes.\n\nFrom (2,3), move D to (2,2) turn 8, then to (2,1) turn 9, but (2,1) food gone at turn 10? Turn 9 span 1, so can eat at turn 9.\n\nAt turn 8: move to (2,2), positions [ (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2) ], tail (3,1) vacated.\n\nThen turn 9: from (2,2) can move D to (2,1), but (2,1) has no food, food at (1,1), so move L to (1,2) or something.\n\n(1,1) is at (1,1), adjacent to (1,2) or (2,1).\n\n(2,1) is empty, so from (2,2) at turn 9, move L to (1,2), which may be empty, then from (1,2) move D to (1,1) to eat.\n\nBut at turn 9, (1,1) span 1, can be eaten.\n\nTurn 9: from (2,2), move to (1,2), no food, positions become [ (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3) ], tail (3,2) vacated.\n\nThen turn 10: from (1,2), can move D to (1,1), which has food, so eat, grow.\n\nBut (1,1) at turn 10 has span 1, so I can eat it on turn 10.\n\nYes.\n\nSo it's possible, but complicated and risky if I make a wrong move.\n\nIf at turn 4 I move D to eat (2,1), then at turn 5 I move L to (1,1) to eat it directly, avoiding the issue.\n\nLet's see that.\n\nTurn 4: move D to (2,1), eat, positions [ (2,1), (2,2), (1,2) ], dir D.\n\nTurn 5: move L to (1,1), eat, positions [ (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (1,2) ], dir L.\n\nThen turn 6: from (1,1), only move U to (1,2), as before, no food, positions become [ (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2) ], dir U.\n\nThen from (1,2), I can move U to (1,3), or R to (2,2) which is tail, safe.\n\nSay move U to (1,3), no food, positions [ (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1) ], tail (2,2) vacated.\n\nThen I can continue up to (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) to eat the food there.\n\n(1,6) last at turn 13, so I have time.\n\nFor example, from (1,3) move U to (1,4) turn 7, (1,5) turn 8, (1,6) turn 9, eat.\n\nSo I can eat (2,1), (1,1), and (1,6), all three, missing (3,1).\n\n(3,1) is not eaten, but I have three foods.\n\nIf I eat (3,1) instead of (1,1), I might eat all four, but with the body, it might be tight.\n\nFor example, at turn 4, move D to (2,1), eat.\n\nTurn 5: move R to (3,1), eat, positions [ (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (1,2) ], dir R.\n\nThen I need to eat (1,1), but (1,1) is adjacent, but from (3,1), I cannot move to (2,1) or directly to (1,1).\n\nThe only way is to go around, but as before, it takes time and (1,1) expires at turn 10.\n\nFrom (3,1) at turn 5, I can move U to (3,2), then to (2,2) or something.\n\nAt turn 5, positions [ (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (1,2) ]\n\nMove U to (3,2), no food, positions [ (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2) ], (1,2) vacated.\n\nThen turn 6: from (3,2), can move L to (2,2) but (2,2) is body, invalid; so move U to (3,3) or R to (4,2).\n\nSay move U to (3,3), positions [ (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1) ], (2,2) vacated.\n\nThen turn 7: from (3,3), move L to (2,3), positions [ (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1) ], (2,1) vacated.\n\nThen turn 8: from (2,3), move D to (2,2), positions [ (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,2) ], (3,1) vacated.\n\nThen turn 9: from (2,2), move D to (2,1), but (2,1) may be empty, no food, then positions [ (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3) ], tail (3,2) vacated.\n\nThen from (2,1), I can move L to (1,1), which has food, at turn 10.\n\nTurn 10: move to (1,1), eat, since (1,1) span 1 at turn 10.\n\nYes, possible, but it takes many turns and I might risk collision or miss other food.\n\nWhereas if I eat (1,1) directly at turn 5, I can be at (1,6) by turn 9.\n\nNow, the food at (3,1) I can eat only if I go for it first or later, but with expiration turn 9, if I go up, I might not eat it.\n\nBut (3,1) is close, I can eat it at turn 4 or 5.\n\nAnother option: at turn 4, instead of moving D, move R to (3,2).\n\nNo food, so positions [ (3,2), (2,2) ], dir R.\n\nThen from (3,2), I can move D to (3,1) to eat the food.\n\nTurn 5: move D to (3,1), eat, positions [ (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) ], since ate, so [ (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) ], and (1,2) vacated, but tail was (1,2), removed when not eating, but when eating, tail stays? Let's see.\n\nTurn 4 move R to (3,2) no eat, so from [ (2,2), (1,2) ], head to (3,2), body to (2,2), tail (1,2) removed, so positions [ (3,2), (2,2) ], length 2.\n\nTurn 5 move D to (3,1), eat, so new head (3,1), body (3,2), and since ate, add new segment, so tail (2,2) remains, positions [ (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) ], length 3, dir D.\n\nThen I can go to eat (2,1) or (1,1), but (2,1) is adjacent at left, but from (3,1), move L to (2,1), which has food, so eat.\n\nTurn 6: move L to (2,1), eat, positions [ (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) ]? Head to (2,1), body to (3,1), body to (3,2), tail (2,2) since ate, so [ (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) ]\n\n(2,2) is position, but it's the tail.\n\nThen from (2,1), facing L, can move D to (2,0) invalid; U to (2,2) but (2,2) is body, invalid; L to (1,1) which has food.\n\nSo move L to (1,1), eat, turn 7, positions [ (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) ]? Let's not get messy.\n\nBasically, I can eat all three bottom foods by turn 7 or so, then go to (1,6).\n\nBut (2,2) might be an issue.\n\nAfter eating (1,1) at turn 7, head at (1,1), then move U to (1,2), etc., to (1,6) by turn 11 or so, but (1,6) last at turn 13, so fine.\n\nAnd (3,1) is eaten.\n\nIn this case, by moving R first, I can eat (3,1), (2,1), (1,1) in sequence.\n\nAt turn 4 move R to (3,2) no eat.\n\nTurn 5 move D to (3,1) eat.\n\nTurn 6 move L to (2,1) eat.\n\nTurn 7 move L to (1,1) eat.\n\nThen turn 8 move U to (1,2), and so on to (1,6).\n\nAll good.\n\nIf I move D at turn 4, I eat (2,1) first, then I can choose to eat (1,1) or (3,1) next, both possible.\n\nBut eating (3,1) might leave (1,1) harder to reach, but as above, it can be done with effort.\n\nSince (1,6) has long life, I can eat the bottom foods first.\n\nNow, the key is to avoid dying and maximize.\n\nAlso, there is the internal obstacle at (5,6), which might affect going to (1,6), but since I'm going left, it should be fine.\n\nNow, back to turn 4, I should move to eat one of the foods.\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns, 5+ turns ahead.\n\nThe answer format is to list actions for turns t1 to t1+ something, at least 5 turns.\n\nt1=4, so I need to specify actions for turn 4,5,6,7,8,9 or more.\n\nBut I don't know the future, so I need to plan a sequence based on current state.\n\nSince no new food, I can plan a path.\n\nAlso, for survival, with length 2, I have space.\n\nBut let's decide on a plan.\n\nI think the best is to eat the three bottom foods quickly, then go to (1,6).\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 4: move D to (2,1) to eat food.\n\nThen turn 5: move L to (1,1) to eat food.\n\nThen turn 6: move U to (1,2)  (no food)\n\nThen turn 7: move U to (1,3)  (no food)\n\nTurn 8: move U to (1,4)  (no food)\n\nTurn 9: move U to (1,5)  (no food)\n\nTurn 10: move U to (1,6) eat food.\n\nAt turn 10, (1,6) has life span, at turn 4:10, turn10:4? Turn 4:10, turn5:9, turn6:8, turn7:7, turn8:6, turn9:5, turn10:4, so yes, still there.\n\nAnd I eat at turn 10.\n\nBut in this sequence, I missed (3,1), but I ate three foods.\n\nIf I want to eat (3,1), I can do it at turn 4 by moving R first.\n\nTurn 4: move R to (3,2) no eat\n\nTurn 5: move D to (3,1) eat\n\nTurn 6: move L to (2,1) eat  (since (2,1) still there, span at turn6: from turn4:6, turn6:4, yes)\n\nTurn 7: move L to (1,1) eat\n\nThen turn 8: move U to (1,2)\n\nTurn 9: move U to (1,3)\n\nTurn 10: move U to (1,4)\n\nTurn 11: move U to (1,5)\n\nTurn 12: move U to (1,6) eat\n\nAll foods eaten, and (1,6) at turn12, span at turn12: turn4:10, turn12:2, yes.\n\nThis seems better, eat all four foods.\n\nAnd no risk of dying, since I'm moving in open areas.\n\nAfter turn 7, I'm at (1,1) with body, but I move up the left column, which is fine.\n\nThe obstacle at (5,6) doesn't affect me since I'm on left.\n\nSo this plan is good.\n\nAt turn 4, if I move U, I might not eat the bottom foods.\n\nSimilarly, moving R directly to (3,2) allows me to access (3,1).\n\nNow, for the actions, I need to specify for several turns.\n\nSince I'm moving in a straight line mostly, I can list.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the direction for no instant reverse.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 4: current dir R, move R to (3,2), new dir R.\n\nTurn 5: from (3,2) dir R, move D to (3,1), new dir D.\n\nIs D opposite to R? R is right, D is down, not opposite, so ok.\n\nThen turn 6: from (3,1) dir D, move L to (2,1), L is left, not opposite to D, ok.\n\nTurn 7: from (2,1) dir L, move L to (1,1), L to L, same direction, ok.\n\nThen turn 8: from (1,1) dir L, but after moving to (1,1), dir is L (left).\n\nThen move U to (1,2), U is up, not opposite to L, so ok.\n\nTurn 9: from (1,2) dir U, move U to (1,3)\n\nTurn 10: U to (1,4)\n\nTurn 11: U to (1,5)\n\nTurn 12: U to (1,6)\n\nAll fine.\n\nI could start by moving D, but then (3,1) might be missed or hard to get.\n\nIn the first sequence with move D, I can still get (3,1) if I move R at turn 5, but then I have to deal with the body.\n\nBut the sequence above is clean.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions from turn 4 onwards for 5+ turns.\n\nSince t1=4, I should output for turn 4 to, say, turn 9 or 10.\n\nBut to be safe, I can do 6 turns.\n\nIn the plan, turn 4 to turn 7 are critical for eating.\n\nThen after that, going up.\n\nBut I can output up to turn 9.\n\nNow, the food at (1,6) is not eaten until later, but it's fine.\n\nAnother thing: Tail Reward Danger, but in this case, no issue.\n\nAlso, when moving, check for walls or obstacles.\n\nIn the path, all cells are within bounds, no obstacles except (5,6) which is far.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 4: move R (to (3,2))\n\nTurn 5: move D (to (3,1), eat)\n\nTurn 6: move L (to (2,1), eat)\n\nTurn 7: move L (to (1,1), eat)\n\nThen continuing:\n\nTurn 8: move U (to (1,2))\n\nTurn 9: move U (to (1,3))\n\nAnd so on.\n\nFor the answer, since it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", I should include at least 5 actions.\n\nSo from turn 4 to turn 8 or 9.\n\nOutput format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: R\nTurn 5: D\nTurn 6: L\nTurn 7: L\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\n}\n\nBut turn 9 move U to (1,3), etc.\n\nI could stop at turn 8, but 5 actions: turn4,5,6,7,8.\n\nTurn 4 to turn 8 is 5 turns.\n\nTurn 4: action for t1\n\nTurn 5: t1+1\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 8: t1+4, so 5 actions.\n\nBut the thinking is ahead, but actions are for current and future.\n\nThe answer should include action for current turn and next few.\n\n\"Answer Format: Turn t1: action on turn t1, Turn t1+1: action on turn t1+1, ...\"\n\nAnd \"prioritize long-term survival\", which I think this plan does.\n\nIf I move D at turn 4, I might get stuck in corner, but in this plan, I end up going up.\n\nIn the sequence after eating (1,1), I go up, which is open.\n\nI think it's fine.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I will plan a sequence of moves that prioritizes eating the positive food with the earliest expiration times while avoiding collisions and dead ends. The key foods are (2,1), (3,1), and (1,1), which expire after turns 9, 9, and 10 respectively, compared to (1,6) which lasts until turn 13. By eating the bottom foods first, I can then safely navigate to (1,6) later. The snake starts at [(2,2), (1,2)] with direction R, so possible moves are U, D, or R (L is reverse and not allowed).\n\n### Plan for 5+ Turns:\n- **Turn 4 (current)**: Move R to (3,2) to position for eating (3,1) next turn. This avoids immediate eating of (2,1) which could corner the snake, and sets up a path to eat all three bottom foods efficiently.\n- **Turn 5**: Move D to (3,1) to eat the food (value +1). Snake grows to length 3, and direction becomes D.\n- **Turn 6**: Move L to (2,1) to eat the food (value +1). Snake grows to length 4, and direction becomes L.\n- **Turn 7**: Move L to (1,1) to eat the food (value +1). Snake grows to length 5, and direction becomes L. All bottom foods are now eaten.\n- **Turn 8**: Move U to (1,2) to start moving toward (1,6). No food here, so snake length remains 5, and direction becomes U.\n- **Turn 9**: Move U to (1,3) to continue upward. (1,6) is still available (life span 5 at turn 9), and this path avoids the obstacle at (5,6).\n\n### Why this plan?\n- **Score Maximization**: Eats three high-value foods by turn 7 (total +3 score, length 5), with (1,6) to be eaten later (by turn 12-13).\n- **Risk Avoidance**: \n  - Moving R on turn 4 avoids the corner at (2,1) and (1,1) early, giving more maneuvering room.\n  - No Tail Reward Danger: The tail never has food when the head is adjacent during eating.\n  - No collisions: All moves are within bounds, avoid walls, and body segments are not collided with (tail moves away when head moves to its position).\n- **Long-Term Survival**: \n  - After eating bottom foods, moving up the left column (y=1 to y=6) is safe and open, with no obstacles on this path.\n  - (1,6) can be reached by turn 12-13 without rush (life span until turn 13).\n- **Efficiency**: Eats all foods except (3,1) if moving D first; this plan eats all four by turn 12.\n\n### Full Sequence (Turns 4-9):\n- Turn 4: Move R (to (3,2)) – Positions: [(3,2), (2,2)], direction R, no eat.\n- Turn 5: Move D (to (3,1)) – Eat (3,1), positions: [(3,1), (3,2), (2,2)], direction D, length 3.\n- Turn 6: Move L (to (2,1)) – Eat (2,1), positions: [(2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2)], direction L, length 4.\n- Turn 7: Move L (to (1,1)) – Eat (1,1), positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2)], direction L, length 5.\n- Turn 8: Move U (to (1,2)) – No food, positions: [(1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2)], direction U, length 5.\n- Turn 9: Move U (to (1,3)) – No food, positions: [(1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1)], direction U, length 5.\n\nAfter turn 9, continue upward to (1,6) for additional score.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 4: R \\\\\nTurn 5: D \\\\\nTurn 6: L \\\\\nTurn 7: L \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U\n}",

That means the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with an internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nCurrent turn is t=5.\n\nSnake positions: head at (3,2), body at (2,2). So the snake is only two segments long right now. Head direction is R, which means it's moving right. Since it's moving right, the last move was from left to right, so it came from (2,2) to (3,2).\n\nFood items:\n\n- (2,1) with value 1, life span 5. Since life span decreases every turn including current, at turn 5, it has 5 turns left, so it will disappear after turn 9? Life span is given as 5, and it decreases each turn, so at turn t, if life span is N, it disappears after N turns. So for (2,1), life span 5 at turn 5, so it will be there until turn 9, and disappear at turn 10? Let's clarify.\n\nThe rule says: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\" So at turn t, with life span N, after this turn, the countdown becomes N-1, and so on, until it reaches 0, and it disappears. So if life span is 5 at turn 5, after turn 5, it becomes 4, then 3 at turn 6, 2 at turn 7, 1 at turn 8, and 0 at turn 9, so it disappears at the start of turn 10 or after turn 9? I need to be careful.\n\nTypically, \"disappears after N turns\" means it lasts for N more turns including the current one. For example, if life span is 1, it disappears after this turn. So at turn t, if life span is N, it will be gone after turn t + N - 1? Let's think.\n\nThe countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at the start of turn t, if life span is N, after the turn, it decreases to N-1. When it reaches 0, it disappears. So for (2,1): at turn 5, life span 5, after turn 5, it becomes 4; after turn 6, 3; ... after turn 9, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it is available from turn 5 to turn 9 inclusive? Turn 5: countdown 5, after turn 5: 4; turn 6: 4, after:3; turn 7:3, after:2; turn 8:2, after:1; turn 9:1, after:0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 5,6,7,8,9. Disappears before turn 10.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFood:\n\n- (2,1): value 1, life 5 (turns 5-9)\n\n- (3,1): value 1, life 5 (turns 5-9)\n\n- (1,1): value 1, life 6 (turns 5-10? At turn 5, life 6, after turn 5:5, turn 6:5 after:4, ..., up to after turn 10:0, disappear before turn 11. So available turns 5 to 10.)\n\nLife span N at turn t means it can be eaten until turn t + N - 1, inclusive? Let's define:\n\nAt turn t, life span N: after turn t, countdown = N-1; if countdown >0, still there; after turn t+1, countdown = N-2, and so on. After turn t + N -1, countdown =0, and it disappears before the next turn. So it exists during turns t to t + N -1.\n\nFor (2,1): N=5 at t=5, so exists turns 5,6,7,8,9 (5 turns).\n\nSimilarly, (3,1): N=5, exists turns 5-9.\n\n(1,1): N=6, exists turns 5 to 10.\n\n(1,6): N=9, exists turns 5 to 13.\n\nAll have value 1, so all positive food.\n\nNow, snake: head at (3,2), body at (2,2), so tail is (2,2). Head direction is R, so last move was to the right.\n\nPossible moves: since head direction is R, I can go U (up), D (down), R (right), but not L (left) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed.\n\nRule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nCurrent direction is R, so I cannot move L immediately. So possible actions: U, D, R.\n\nNow, grid: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so boundaries. Internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nPlayable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (5,6) is blocked.\n\nCurrent snake occupies (3,2) and (2,2).\n\nFood at: (2,1), (3,1), (1,1), (1,6)\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's list possible moves for turn 5.\n\nFrom head (3,2):\n\n- Up (U): to (3,3)\n\n- Down (D): to (3,1) — but (3,1) has food! Value 1, positive food.\n\n- Right (R): to (4,2)\n\nNow, if I go to (3,1), that's eating the food at (3,1). Since it's positive food, snake length increases by 1, so after eating, snake becomes positions: head at (3,1), then the previous head (3,2) becomes body, and tail (2,2) is still there, but since we eat, we add a segment, so new positions: [ (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) ]? Let's see.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat, the tail doesn't move that turn, so the snake grows. Positions: before move, snake at [head, body] = [(3,2), (2,2)]\n\nAfter moving to a food cell: head moves to (3,1), which has food, so we eat it. The body segments follow: the previous head (3,2) becomes the new body, and the tail (2,2) remains, but since we eat, we add a new segment, so the tail doesn't move, so positions become: [ (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) ] — yes, length 3 now.\n\nBut the food was at (3,1), and we move head there, so we eat it.\n\nNow, is there any danger? (3,1) is not a wall, not occupied by body except if it were, but currently body is at (2,2) and (3,2), so (3,1) is free except for food.\n\nBut let's check for Tail Reward Danger: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake...\"\n\nHere, the head is moving to (3,1), and the tail is at (2,2). Are they adjacent? (3,1) and (2,2) are not adjacent; adjacent means sharing an edge, like up/down/left/right, not diagonal. So (3,1) and (2,2) are diagonal, not adjacent. Distance: |dx|=1, |dy|=1, so not adjacent; adjacent would be |dx| + |dy| =1.\n\nSo no issue here.\n\nSimilarly, other moves.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, after moving, the head direction will change based on what I do.\n\nNow, let's consider the options for turn 5.\n\nOption 1: Move D to (3,1) — eat food, grow to length 3.\n\nThen snake positions: [(3,1), (3,2), (2,2)]\n\nHead direction: since I moved down, new direction is D.\n\nThen for next turn, possible moves from (3,1): U (to (3,2) but that's body now), L (to (2,1)), D (to (3,0) but y=0 is wall, so invalid), R (to (4,1))\n\n(3,2) is occupied by body, so cannot go there. Walls: y=0 is wall, so (3,0) is invalid. So possible: L to (2,1) or R to (4,1)\n\n(2,1) has food! Value 1.\n\nIf I go L to (2,1), I eat that food too? But let's see.\n\nAfter turn 5, snake is at [(3,1), (3,2), (2,2)]\n\nThen turn 6: if I move L to (2,1), which has food.\n\nSo head moves to (2,1), which is food, so eat, grow to length 4. Positions: head (2,1), then previous head (3,1) becomes body, then (3,2), then (2,2). But since we eat, tail doesn't move, so positions: [ (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) ]\n\nNow, (2,2) is the tail, and head is at (2,1). Are they adjacent? (2,1) and (2,2) are adjacent vertically? (2,1) is at y=1, (2,2) at y=2, same x, so yes, |dy|=1, adjacent.\n\nNow, the tail cell is (2,2), does it have food? At this point, after moving to (2,1), the food at (2,1) is eaten, so gone. But the tail is at (2,2), which may or may not have food.\n\nCurrently, at turn 5, there is food at (2,1), but when we move to (2,1) on turn 6, we eat it, so it's removed. The cell (2,2) has no food; food was at (2,1), not (2,2).\n\n(2,2) is the tail position, but it doesn't have food; the food is separate.\n\nTail Reward Danger: \"if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake\"\n\nHere, after moving to (2,1), head at (2,1), tail at (2,2), they are adjacent. But the tail cell is (2,2), and does it have food? At this moment, no, because food was at (2,1), which was just eaten. (2,2) is occupied by the tail segment, and no food is there. Food is only at specific positions.\n\nThe danger is when the tail cell itself has food on it, and you eat that food while head is adjacent to tail.\n\nIn this case, (2,2) does not have food; food was at (2,1), different cell.\n\nSo no danger.\n\nBut let's confirm the rule: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nHere, when you eat food at the tail cell, but in this case, I'm eating at (2,1), not at (2,2).\n\n(2,2) is tail, but no food there.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nAfter eating at (2,1), snake is at [ (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) ] — now, positions: (2,1) head, (3,1) body, (3,2) body, (2,2) tail. Notice that (2,1) and (2,2) are adjacent, but since no food involved in that cell, it's fine. But the snake body: from (2,1) to (3,1) to (3,2) to (2,2), which forms a sort of loop, but in terms of collision, the head is at (2,1), and body segments are (3,1), (3,2), (2,2). Is the head adjacent to body? (2,1) and (2,2) are adjacent, and (2,2) is a body segment, so if head moves to a cell adjacent to body, it might collide if it moves onto it.\n\nCollision rule: head touches any body segment except the tail, but since tail moves, it's ok to move to where tail was.\n\nIn this case, at turn 6, after moving to (2,1), the positions are as above. For the next move, if I try to move, say, down to (2,0), invalid, or up to (2,2), but (2,2) is the tail, but currently occupied by body.\n\nAfter moving to (2,1), the tail is at (2,2), and if I move up to (2,2), that would be moving onto the tail. But since the tail will move, it might be ok, but in snake, when you move, the head moves to new position, and tail moves away, so if you move to where tail was, it's ok because tail leaves that cell.\n\nStandard snake mechanics: when you move, head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and the tail segment is removed if no growth, or stays if growth.\n\nBut when you eat, tail doesn't move, so the cell is occupied.\n\nBut for collision: head collides if it moves to a cell occupied by a body segment, except that it is allowed to move to the cell that was the tail, because the tail moves away simultaneously.\n\nThe rule says: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, moving to the tail cell is safe because the tail moves.\n\nIn this case, after turn 6, positions: [ (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) ]\n\nIf I want to move to (2,2), which is the tail, it should be safe because the tail will move to the next position.\n\nBut let's not get ahead; we're at turn 5 choices.\n\nBack to turn 5.\n\nOption 1: Move D to (3,1) — eat food, grow to length 3. Positions: [(3,1), (3,2), (2,2)] Head direction D.\n\nThen for turn 6, from (3,1), possible moves: L to (2,1) or R to (4,1)\n\nU to (3,2) is body, invalid; D to (3,0) wall, invalid.\n\nSo only L or R.\n\nIf I go L to (2,1), which has food, so eat again, grow to length 4. Positions: [ (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) ] Head direction L.\n\nThen turn 7, from (2,1), possible moves: U to (2,2), but (2,2) is tail, and it will move, so should be safe? Let's see.\n\nCurrent positions: head (2,1), body (3,1), (3,2), tail (2,2)\n\nIf I move U to (2,2), head to (2,2). Since (2,2) was tail, and we move there, but the tail will move to where? When head moves to (2,2), the segment that was at (2,2) will move to the previous position of the segment ahead, which is (3,2)? Let's trace.\n\nBefore move: positions [ (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) ] indices: head 0: (2,1), 1: (3,1), 2: (3,2), 3: (2,2) tail.\n\nAfter moving head to (2,2): new head at (2,2). Then each body segment moves to previous position: segment 1 moves to where head was, (2,1); segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was, (3,1); segment 3 (tail) moves to where segment 2 was, (3,2). Since we didn't eat, no growth, so tail moves.\n\nNew positions: head (2,2), then body: (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) — tail is now (3,2).\n\nAnd (2,2) had no food, so no eat.\n\nBut now, head is at (2,2), body at (2,1), (3,1), (3,2). Head at (2,2) is adjacent to body at (2,1) and (3,2)? (2,2) and (2,1) are adjacent down, but positions: head (2,2), body segments: (2,1), (3,1), (3,2). So (2,2) and (2,1) share an edge, so if head is at (2,2) and body at (2,1), that is a collision, because it's touching the body.\n\nBut in the move, when we move to (2,2), at that moment, before the tail moves, (2,2) is occupied by the tail, but since we move to it, and the tail moves away, it should not collide.\n\nThe rule says: you can move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\n\nIn this case, when moving to (2,2), it was the tail cell, so it's allowed, and after move, the tail has moved to (3,2), so no collision.\n\nBut the body segment at (2,1) is not the tail; the tail was at (2,2), which moved.\n\nAfter move, positions are [ (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) ] with head at (2,2), and (2,1) is body, which is adjacent, but (2,2) and (2,1) are different cells, so head is at (2,2), body at (2,1), no problem, as long as not same cell.\n\nCollision only if head and body share the same cell.\n\nSo after moving to (2,2), the cell (2,2) is now head, and (2,1) is body, separate cells, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) is body, but not adjacent to head at (2,2) in terms of same cell; they are diagonal, not same cell.\n\nSo safe.\n\nFrom (2,1), other moves: D to (2,0) wall, invalid; L to (1,1) or R to (3,1) but (3,1) is body, invalid. So possible U to (2,2) or L to (1,1).\n\n(1,1) has food.\n\nBut let's not go too deep yet.\n\nBack to turn 5.\n\nOther options: move U to (3,3) or R to (4,2)\n\nFirst, let's list all possible actions for turn 5 and their immediate effects.\n\nAction D: to (3,1) - eat food, grow to len 3, head dir D. Positions: [(3,1), (3,2), (2,2)]\n\nThen turn 6, from (3,1): can go L to (2,1) or R to (4,1)\n\nAction U: to (3,3) - no food, so no grow, snake moves: head to (3,3), tail moves from (2,2) to where head was (3,2)? Positions before move: [(3,2), (2,2)]\n\nMove head to (3,3), no food, so tail moves: the body segment (which was head) moves to new head position? Standard: head moves to (3,3), then the body segment (2,2) moves to the previous head position (3,2). So new positions: [(3,3), (3,2)] with head at (3,3), body at (3,2). Head dir U.\n\nThen turn 6, from (3,3), possible moves: U to (3,4), D to (3,2) but (3,2) is body, invalid, L to (2,3), R to (4,3)\n\nAction R: to (4,2) - no food, so move: head to (4,2), body to (3,2), tail gone? Positions: before [(3,2), (2,2)], after move: head to (4,2), body to previous head (3,2), so [(4,2), (3,2)] head dir R.\n\nThen turn 6, from (4,2), possible moves: U to (4,3), D to (4,1), L to (3,2) but (3,2) is body, invalid, R to (5,2)\n\nNow, I need to think about the food and their life spans.\n\nFood at (2,1) life 5, so available turns 5-9\n\n(3,1) life 5, turns 5-9\n\n(1,1) life 6, turns 5-10\n\n(1,6) life 9, turns 5-13\n\nSince snake is short, eating food is good to grow, but need to avoid risks.\n\nAlso, internal obstacle at (5,6), which might be relevant later.\n\nNow, let's consider the grid state.\n\nGrid size: x 1 to 6, y 1 to 6, except (5,6) blocked.\n\nCurrent snake at (3,2) and (2,2).\n\nFood at (2,1), (3,1), (1,1), (1,6)\n\n(1,6) is far, might not be reachable soon.\n\nPrioritize long-term survival.\n\nIf I eat both (3,1) and (2,1) quickly, I can grow to length 4, but then I might be in a corner.\n\nLet's simulate option 1: move D to (3,1) on turn 5.\n\nTurn 5: move D to (3,1), eat food, positions: [(3,1), (3,2), (2,2)] head dir D.\n\nTurn 6: from (3,1), I can go L to (2,1) or R to (4,1)\n\nIf go L to (2,1): eat food, grow to len 4, positions: [(2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2)] head dir L.\n\nNow, at this point, the snake is in a 2x2 block: (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) — it's a loop, but not collided.\n\nNow for turn 7, from (2,1), possible moves:\n\n- U to (2,2): which is currently tail, but will move. As we saw earlier, moving to (2,2) is safe, and after move, positions: head to (2,2), then body: segment 1 to (2,1), segment 2 to (3,1), segment 3 to (3,2). New positions: [(2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2)] head at (2,2), body at (2,1), (3,1), (3,2). Head dir U.\n\n- Or L to (1,1): which has food. (1,1) is available.\n\nIf go L to (1,1): eat food, grow to len 5. Positions: head to (1,1), then previous positions: body moves to where? Before move: [ (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) ]\n\nHead to (1,1), eat, so no tail move. New positions: [ (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) ]\n\nNow, head at (1,1), tail at (2,2). Body at (2,1), (3,1), (3,2).\n\nFor turn 8, from (1,1), possible moves: U to (1,2), D to (1,0) wall invalid, L to (0,1) wall invalid, R to (2,1) but (2,1) is body, invalid. So only U to (1,2).\n\nMove U to (1,2), no food? Is there food? No, so move: head to (1,2), body: segment 1 to (1,1), segment 2 to (2,1), segment 3 to (3,1), tail to (3,2)? Positions: before [ (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) ] indices: head 0: (1,1), 1: (2,1), 2: (3,1), 3: (3,2), 4: (2,2) tail.\n\nAfter move head to (1,2), no eat, so tail moves: segment 1 to (1,1), segment 2 to (2,1), segment 3 to (3,1), segment 4 to (3,2). New positions: [(1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2)] with tail at (3,2).\n\nHead at (1,2), body at (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2).\n\nThen turn 9, from (1,2), possible moves: U to (1,3), D to (1,1) body invalid, L to (0,2) wall invalid, R to (2,2) — (2,2) is not occupied, currently body at (1,1), (2,1), etc, (2,2) is free? Positions: head (1,2), body (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), so (2,2) is free, yes.\n\nSo can go U to (1,3) or R to (2,2).\n\nIf go R to (2,2), no food, move: head to (2,2), body to (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), tail to (3,2)? Before: [ (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) ] tail (3,2)\n\nAfter head to (2,2), no eat, so segment 1 to (1,2), segment 2 to (1,1), segment 3 to (2,1), segment 4 to (3,1), tail to (3,2) but (3,2) is where segment 4 moves? New positions: head (2,2), then body: (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), tail (3,2) — (3,2) is tail.\n\nBut (3,2) is occupied, but it's tail.\n\nHead at (2,2), no collision.\n\nBut this is getting messy. Point is, after eating those foods, the snake is in the bottom left corner, and might have limited moves.\n\nFrom (1,2), I could go U to (1,3), etc.\n\nBut food at (1,6) is far, and other foods have short life.\n\n(2,1) and (3,1) will disappear after turn 9, so if I don't eat them soon, they're gone.\n\n(1,1) has life 6, so until turn 10.\n\n(1,6) has life 9, until turn 13.\n\nNow, back to turn 5, if I move D to (3,1), I can eat it and then possibly (2,1), growing quickly.\n\nBut then I'm at (2,1) with length 4, and I can go to (1,1) or to (2,2).\n\nIf I go to (1,1), I eat that too, growing to 5, but then I'm stuck at (1,1), only can go up to (1,2), then from there I can go up or right.\n\nBut the grid has space, so I can navigate.\n\nFor example, from (1,2), I can go U to (1,3), then to (1,4), etc, or R to (2,2), then to (3,2), etc.\n\nBut (3,2) might be occupied later.\n\nSince I have to think 5+ turns, let's consider other options for turn 5.\n\nOption: move U to (3,3) on turn 5.\n\nTurn 5: move U to (3,3), no food, positions: [(3,3), (3,2)] head dir U.\n\nThen turn 6, from (3,3), can go U to (3,4), L to (2,3), R to (4,3) — D to (3,2) body invalid.\n\nSay, I go U to (3,4), no food, positions: [(3,4), (3,3)] head dir U.\n\nThen turn 7, from (3,4), U to (3,5), L to (2,4), R to (4,4) — D to (3,3) body invalid.\n\nAnd so on. But this way, I'm not eating food, and the foods at (2,1) etc will disappear soon.\n\nLife span: (2,1) and (3,1) disappear after turn 9, so by turn 10 they are gone. I have until turn 9 to eat them.\n\nIf I go up, I might not reach them in time.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) until turn 10.\n\nBut from (3,4), I can go down later, but it might be tight.\n\nFor example, from (3,4) on turn 7, if I go D to (3,3), but (3,3) is body, invalid, so I need to go left or right to turn around.\n\nThis seems inefficient for eating food.\n\nOption move R to (4,2) on turn 5.\n\nTurn 5: move R to (4,2), no food, positions: [(4,2), (3,2)] head dir R.\n\nThen turn 6, from (4,2), can go U to (4,3), D to (4,1), R to (5,2) — L to (3,2) body invalid.\n\n(4,1) has no food, but I can go there.\n\nIf I go D to (4,1), no food, positions: [(4,1), (4,2)] head dir D.\n\nThen turn 7, from (4,1), can go L to (3,1) or R to (5,1) or U to (4,2) body invalid, D to (4,0) wall invalid.\n\n(3,1) has food, so if I go L to (3,1), I can eat it.\n\nSimilarly, I can reach (2,1) later.\n\nBut let's compare the paths.\n\nAlso, there is food at (1,6), which is top left, y=6 is top since y=0 bottom? Walls: y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to y=6, with y=6 being the top row.\n\nIn coordinates, typically y increases up, but in the state, it says U (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, so higher y is up.\n\nWalls: y=0 bottom, y=7 top, but playable y=1 to 6, so y=1 bottom, y=6 top.\n\nSimilarly x=0 left, x=7 right, playable x=1 to 6.\n\nFood at (1,6) is top left corner.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,6), which is top right, x=5,y=6.\n\nNow, for long-term, I should aim to eat all foods if possible.\n\nBut (1,6) has long life, so I can eat it later.\n\nThe short-life foods are (2,1), (3,1), (1,1) which will be gone by turn 10.\n\nTurn 5 now, so I have 5 turns to eat them? From turn 5 to turn 9 inclusive.\n\nAt turn 5, I can eat (3,1) or (2,1) if I move there.\n\n(2,1) is at (2,1), from head (3,2), I can go D to (3,1) or L but I can't go L directly because direction is R, instant reverse not allowed, so I can't go from (3,2) to (2,2) directly, because that would be left, opposite to current right direction.\n\nSo only way to (2,1) is via (3,1) or from above, but not directly.\n\nFrom (3,2), to reach (2,1), I need to go down to (3,1) then left, or go left but can't, or other ways.\n\nBut with direction constraint.\n\nBack to choices.\n\nPerhaps the best is to eat the nearby food to grow.\n\nBut let's consider risk.\n\nIf I eat (3,1) and (2,1), I end up at (2,1) with length 4, and then I can go to (1,1) or to (2,2).\n\nIf I go to (1,1), I eat, grow to 5, at (1,1), then only move up to (1,2), then from (1,2) I can go up or right.\n\nFrom (1,2), if I go right to (2,2), which is free, then to (3,2), etc.\n\nBut (3,2) might be occupied, but in the sequence above, it was free.\n\nIn the earlier simulation, when at (1,2), positions were [ (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) ] so (2,2) is free, (3,2) is body.\n\nSo from (1,2), go R to (2,2), no food, positions become [ (2,2), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1) ] tail at (3,1).\n\nThen from (2,2), can go U to (2,3), D to (2,1) body invalid, L to (1,2) body invalid, R to (3,2) — (3,2) is not occupied now? In new positions, body at (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), so (3,2) is free? (3,1) is body, but (3,2) is different cell.\n\nx=3,y=2, which was previously occupied, but after move, it's free.\n\nPositions: head (2,2), body (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1) — so cells occupied: (2,2), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1). So (3,2) is free.\n\nSo from (2,2), can go U to (2,3), R to (3,2), or D but (2,1) occupied, invalid.\n\nGo R to (3,2), no food, positions: head to (3,2), body to (2,2), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), tail to (3,1)? Before: [ (2,2), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1) ] tail (3,1)\n\nAfter head to (3,2), no eat, so segment 1 to (2,2), segment 2 to (1,2), segment 3 to (1,1), segment 4 to (2,1), tail to (3,1). New positions: [ (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1) ] with tail at (2,1).\n\nHead at (3,2), etc.\n\nSo I can navigate out.\n\nBut it's a bit inefficient.\n\nFrom turn 5, if I move U or R, I might miss the food.\n\nFor example, if I move U to (3,3) on turn 5, then to (3,4) on turn 6, then on turn 7 I can go L to (2,4) or something, but to reach (3,1), it would take several turns, and by turn 7 or 8, the food might still be there, but I need to go down.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can go down only if I turn, but from (3,4), I can go L to (2,4), then D to (2,3), etc, but to reach (3,1), it might take until turn 8 or 9, risky if I don't make it in time.\n\nSimilarly for (2,1).\n\nWhereas if I eat them early, I secure the points.\n\nAlso, eating early makes the snake longer, which might be harder to maneuever, but in this case, the grid is small, so growing is good for score, but need to avoid dying.\n\nAnother option: move R to (4,2) on turn 5.\n\nThen from (4,2), on turn 6, I can go D to (4,1) or U to (4,3) or R to (5,2).\n\nIf I go D to (4,1), no food, positions [(4,1), (4,2)]\n\nThen turn 7, from (4,1), I can go L to (3,1) which has food, so eat, grow to len 3: positions [ (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) ]? Before move: [(4,1), (4,2)] head at (4,1)\n\nMove L to (3,1), eat, so new head (3,1), body: previous head (4,1) becomes body, and tail (4,2) stays, so positions [ (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) ]\n\nThen I can go to (2,1) from here.\n\nFrom (3,1), turn 8, go L to (2,1), eat, grow to len 4: positions [ (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) ]\n\nThen similar as before.\n\nBut I ate (3,1) on turn 7 and (2,1) on turn 8, which is before turn 9, so ok.\n\n(1,1) is still there until turn 10.\n\nFrom (2,1), I can go to (1,1) on turn 9.\n\nBut let's see the state.\n\nFirst, on turn 5, move R to (4,2), no eat, len 2.\n\nTurn 6, move D to (4,1), no eat, len 2, positions [(4,1), (4,2)]\n\nTurn 7, move L to (3,1), eat, len 3, positions [(3,1), (4,1), (4,2)]\n\nTurn 8, from (3,1), can go L to (2,1) or R to (4,1) but (4,1) is body, invalid, or U to (3,2), or D invalid.\n\nU to (3,2): (3,2) is free? Currently occupied: (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), so (3,2) free.\n\nGo U to (3,2), no food, move: head to (3,2), body to (3,1), tail to (4,1)? Positions before: [(3,1), (4,1), (4,2)] tail (4,2)\n\nAfter head to (3,2), no eat, so segment 1 to (3,1), segment 2 to (4,1), tail to (4,2). New positions: [(3,2), (3,1), (4,1)] with tail at (4,1).\n\nBut (4,2) is free now.\n\nThen I missed (2,1).\n\nFrom (3,1), on turn 8, go L to (2,1), eat, as I said.\n\nGo L to (2,1), eat, positions: [ (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) ]\n\nThen turn 9, from (2,1), can go L to (1,1) or U to (2,2) or R to (3,1) body invalid, D invalid.\n\n(1,1) has food, so go L to (1,1), eat, grow to len 5, positions [ (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2) ]\n\nThen turn 10, from (1,1), only U to (1,2), as before.\n\nSo I can eat all three foods: (3,1), (2,1), (1,1) by turn 9.\n\nIn the first option, if I move D on turn 5, I eat (3,1) on turn 5, (2,1) on turn 6, and (1,1) on turn 7 or later.\n\nIn move D on turn 5: eat (3,1)\n\nTurn 6: go L to (2,1), eat (2,1)\n\nThen turn 7: from (2,1), I can go L to (1,1), eat (1,1) on turn 7.\n\nPositions: turn 5: D to (3,1), eat, len3 [(3,1),(3,2),(2,2)]\n\nTurn 6: L to (2,1), eat, len4 [(2,1),(3,1),(3,2),(2,2)]\n\nTurn 7: L to (1,1), eat, len5 [(1,1),(2,1),(3,1),(3,2),(2,2)]\n\nThen turn 8: only U to (1,2), no eat, positions: head to (1,2), body to (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), tail to (2,2)? Before: [(1,1),(2,1),(3,1),(3,2),(2,2)] tail (2,2)\n\nAfter head to (1,2), no eat, so segment 1 to (1,1), segment 2 to (2,1), segment 3 to (3,1), segment 4 to (3,2), tail to (2,2). New positions: [(1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2)] with tail at (3,2).\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo in both cases, I can eat the three foods by turn 7 or 8.\n\nIn the move R first, I eat later but still in time.\n\nBut in move R first, on turn 5 I didn't eat, so I have one less point initially.\n\nIn move D on turn 5, I eat immediately, so better for score.\n\nAlso, less risk of food disappearing if I eat sooner.\n\n(2,1) and (3,1) both disappear after turn 9, so as long as I eat by turn 9, it's fine.\n\nBut eating early is better.\n\nNow, what about moving to (3,1) directly.\n\nBut there is also food at (2,1) adjacent.\n\nAnother thing: in the state, there is food at (1,6), which is far, but I can go there later.\n\nAfter eating the bottom foods, I can navigate to the top.\n\nBut there is an internal obstacle at (5,6), which might block the path.\n\nGrid: rows y=1 to 6, columns x=1 to 6.\n\n(5,6) is blocked, so at top row y=6, x=5 is wall, so I can go to (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), but not (5,6), and (6,6) is playable.\n\nx=6,y=6 is ok, since walls at x=7.\n\nNow, to reach (1,6) from bottom left, I need to go up.\n\nBut with a longer snake, it might be tricky, but possible.\n\nSince I need to maximize score, eating all food is good.\n\n(1,6) has life until turn 13, so after eating the bottom foods, I have time to go up.\n\nFor example, from (1,2) or wherever, I can go up the left side to (1,6).\n\nBut let's think about the initial choice.\n\nPerhaps I should consider not eating (3,1) immediately to have more space.\n\nBut since the snake is short, it's fine.\n\nAnother risk: Tail Reward Danger, but in this case, no issue.\n\nAlso, food under body: but currently, no food under snake.\n\nSnake at (3,2) and (2,2), food at (2,1), (3,1), etc, not under.\n\nSo I think moving D to (3,1) on turn 5 is good.\n\nThen on turn 6, move L to (2,1) to eat that.\n\nThen on turn 7, move L to (1,1) to eat that.\n\nThen on turn 8, move U to (1,2).\n\nThen from there, I can plan to go to (1,6).\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the answer format is to list actions starting from turn t1, for several turns, but it doesn't specify how many, but since it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", I should list actions for 5 turns or so.\n\nThe answer format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ... }\n\nBut it doesn't say how many, but I should provide a sequence.\n\nSince the food life spans are short, I can list until I eat the foods or something.\n\nBut to be safe, let's list for 5 turns: turn 5 to turn 9.\n\nNow for turn 5, action D.\n\nThen turn 6, from (3,1), I should go L to (2,1) to eat.\n\nThen turn 7, from (2,1), go L to (1,1) to eat.\n\nThen turn 8, from (1,1), only U to (1,2).\n\nThen turn 9, from (1,2), I can go U to (1,3) or R to (2,2).\n\nSince I need to think ahead, after that, I might want to go towards (1,6).\n\nBut (1,6) is at top, so I should go up.\n\nSo on turn 9, from (1,2), go U to (1,3).\n\nThen turn 10, from (1,3), go U to (1,4), and so on.\n\nBut let's confirm if all moves are valid.\n\nFirst, on turn 5: move D to (3,1) - valid, eat food.\n\nSnake now: [(3,1), (3,2), (2,2)] dir D\n\nTurn 6: move L to (2,1) - valid, since from (3,1), L is left to (2,1), not reverse? Current direction is D (down), moving left is not opposite; opposite would be up. So allowed. And (2,1) has food, eat. Snake: [(2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2)] dir L\n\nTurn 7: move L to (1,1) - valid, direction was L, moving L again is allowed, not reverse. (1,1) has food, eat. Snake: [(1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2)] dir L\n\nNow, positions: head (1,1), body (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), tail (2,2). (2,2) is tail, and head at (1,1), not adjacent.\n\nTurn 8: from (1,1), move U to (1,2) - only choice, no food. Snake moves: head to (1,2), body to (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), tail to (2,2)? Before: [(1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2)] tail (2,2)\n\nAfter move: head to (1,2), no eat, so segments move: seg1 to (1,1), seg2 to (2,1), seg3 to (3,1), seg4 to (3,2), tail to (2,2). New positions: [(1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2)] with tail at (3,2). Head dir U.\n\nTurn 9: from (1,2), possible moves: U to (1,3), D to (1,1) body invalid, L to (0,2) wall invalid, R to (2,2) — (2,2) is free? Current positions: (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), so (2,2) is free, yes.\n\nI can go U to (1,3) or R to (2,2).\n\nSince (1,6) is up, better to go U to (1,3) to start moving up.\n\nThen later turns.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to list actions.\n\nThe sequence for turns 5-9.\n\nTurn 5: D\n\nTurn 6: L\n\nTurn 7: L\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U (to (1,3))\n\nOn turn 9, if I go U to (1,3), no food.\n\nThen turn 10, from (1,3), go U to (1,4), and so on to (1,5), (1,6) to eat the food there on turn, say, 11 or 12.\n\n(1,6) life until turn 13, so turn 12 or 13 to eat.\n\nBut for now, with the actions above, I eat three foods by turn 7.\n\nIs there a better move?\n\nWhat if on turn 5, I move to (4,2) instead.\n\nThen I might eat later, but I miss the immediate point.\n\nFor example, turn 5: R to (4,2)\n\nTurn 6: D to (4,1) (since I can go there to approach food)\n\nTurn 7: L to (3,1), eat\n\nTurn 8: L to (2,1), eat\n\nTurn 9: L to (1,1), eat\n\nThen turn 10: U to (1,2)\n\nBut on turn 5, I didn't eat, so I have one less point compared to moving D on turn 5.\n\nAlso, on turn 9, I eat (1,1), but (1,1) disappears after turn 10, so eating on turn 9 is fine.\n\nBut in this case, I ate only on turns 7,8,9, whereas in the first sequence, I ate on turns 5,6,7.\n\nSo better to eat earlier to have points earlier and grow.\n\nMoreover, in the first sequence, after turn 7, I have length 5, which might help in survival or something, but not directly.\n\nBut I think moving D on turn 5 is better.\n\nPerhaps I can go to (2,1) first, but I can't directly from (3,2) with direction R.\n\nUnless I go down or something.\n\nAnother idea: from (3,2), go D to (3,1), as before.\n\nOr, if I go R to (4,2), then later down, but slower.\n\nI think D is fine.\n\nNow, about the answer format, I need to list actions for several turns.\n\nSince it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I'll list for 5 turns: turn 5 to turn 9.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 5: D (down)\n\nTurn 6: L (left)\n\nTurn 7: L (left)\n\nTurn 8: U (up)\n\nTurn 9: U (up) to (1,3)\n\nBut on turn 9, from (1,2), I could go R to (2,2), but going up is better for long-term to reach (1,6).\n\nAlso, no food there, so either is fine, but U is towards the other food.\n\nTo confirm the grid, after turn 8, snake at (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) tail at (3,2)\n\n(2,2) is free, but if I go R to (2,2), then I might go to other areas, but (1,6) is isolated, so better to go up directly.\n\nMoreover, there might be other foods later, but currently only (1,6) left with long life.\n\nSo I think U is ok.\n\nIn the sequence, after turn 7, I have eaten all bottom foods, so moving up is good.\n\nNow, for the output.\n\nBut let's make sure about the life spans.\n\nFood (2,1): life span 5 at turn 5, so after turn 5, countdown 4, ..., after turn 9, countdown 0, disappear. So can be eaten until turn 9.\n\nSimilarly (3,1): same.\n\n(1,1): life 6 at turn 5, after turn 5:5, ..., after turn 10:0, disappear before turn 11, so can be eaten until turn 10.\n\nIn my sequence, I ate (2,1) on turn 6, (3,1) on turn 5, (1,1) on turn 7, all before turn 10.\n\n(1,6): life 9, until turn 13.\n\nAfter turn 9, I can continue to go up to eat it.\n\nBut for the answer, I think listing until turn 9 is sufficient, as per \"5+ turns\" from turn 5.\n\nTurn 5 to turn 9 is 5 turns.\n\nActions: turn5 D, turn6 L, turn7 L, turn8 U, turn9 U.\n\nBut on turn9, moving to (1,3).\n\nPerhaps I should specify the action.\n\nIn the state, there is also food at (1,6), but not immediate.\n\nAnother thing: internal obstacle at (5,6), but not relevant for now.\n\nI think this is fine.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, the strategy involves eating the nearby positive food items (2,1), (3,1), and (1,1) as soon as possible, as they have short life spans and will disappear after turns 9, 9, and 10 respectively. Eating these early secures points and grows the snake, providing more flexibility for future moves. The food at (1,6) has a longer life span (until turn 13) and can be targeted later after securing the bottom-left foods.\n\nThe snake starts at turn 5 with head at (3,2) and direction right (R). The immediate move to (3,1) (down) eats the positive food there, growing the snake to length 3. Subsequent moves then target (2,1) and (1,1) efficiently. After eating these, the snake moves upward toward (1,6) to continue scoring.\n\n### Key Considerations for 5+ Turns Ahead:\n- **Food Life Spans**: \n  - (2,1) and (3,1) must be eaten by turn 9; (1,1) by turn 10. The sequence below eats all by turn 7.\n  - (1,6) can be eaten later (by turn 13), so upward movement is prioritized after turn 7.\n- **Collision Avoidance**: \n  - No wall or body collisions occur in this sequence. The only potential risk (Tail Reward Danger) is avoided since the tail cells never have food when the head is adjacent.\n- **Movement Constraints**: \n  - No instant reverse (e.g., from R, cannot move L immediately). All moves respect current direction.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: \n  - Growing to length 5 quickly allows better coverage of the grid. After securing bottom-left foods, moving up the left side (e.g., to (1,6)) avoids obstacles and open areas for future food collection. The internal obstacle at (5,6) is irrelevant in the short term but will be navigated around later.\n\n### Action Sequence (Turns 5 to 9):\n- **Turn 5**: Move down (D) to (3,1). This eats the positive food at (3,1), growing the snake to length 3. New positions: [(3,1), (3,2), (2,2)]. Head direction now D.\n- **Turn 6**: Move left (L) to (2,1). This eats the positive food at (2,1), growing to length 4. New positions: [(2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2)]. Head direction now L.\n- **Turn 7**: Move left (L) to (1,1). This eats the positive food at (1,1), growing to length 5. New positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2)]. Head direction now L.\n- **Turn 8**: Move up (U) to (1,2). No food here; the snake moves without growing. New positions: [(1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2)]. Head direction now U.\n- **Turn 9**: Move up (U) to (1,3). No food here; continues upward path toward (1,6). New positions: [(1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1)]. Head direction now U.\n\n### Beyond Turn 9:\n- **Turns 10-13**: Continue moving up to eat (1,6) by turn 11 or 12 (e.g., U to (1,4), U to (1,5), U to (1,6)). This food is safe to eat until turn 13. After that, navigate open areas while avoiding walls and the obstacle at (5,6).\n\nThis sequence scores 3 points by turn 7 and positions the snake for further scoring. It avoids all immediate risks and leverages the short life spans of nearby food.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 5: D\nTurn 6: L\nTurn 7: L\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the game. It's turn 6, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 are walls, and there's an internal obstacle at (5,6). So, the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Let me confirm the grid size.\n\nThe border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is 8x8, but since walls are at the edges, the snake can move from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6. x=0 and x=7 are walls, so valid x-coordinates are 1 to 6, similarly y=1 to 6. But y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6. Also, internal obstacle at (5,6), which is within 1-6 for both, so that's blocked.\n\nNow, snake positions: head at (3,1), then body at (3,2), and tail at (2,2). So the snake has three segments. Head direction is down (D), meaning it's moving downward.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (2,1) with value 1 and life span 4. Life span decreases every turn, including current turn, so at turn 6, life span 4 means it will disappear after 4 more turns? Life span decreases each turn, so if life span is N, it disappears after N turns, meaning it lasts for N more turns including the current one? Let me read carefully.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo, at a given turn, if a food has life span L, it will disappear after L turns, meaning it can be eaten for L more turns, including the current turn. After L turns, it's gone. Countdown decreases each turn, so after this turn, life span becomes L-1 for next turn.\n\nFor food at (2,1): value 1, life span 4 at turn 6. So, it can be eaten from turn 6 to turn 9 (since it disappears after 4 turns, so turns 6,7,8,9? Let's clarify.\n\nIf at turn t, life span is L, then:\n\n- At turn t, countdown = L\n\n- After turn t, countdown = L-1\n\n- It disappears when countdown reaches 0, so it can be eaten until turn t + L - 1? I need to be precise.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" – I think \"after N turns\" means after N turns from now, it disappears. So if current turn is T, and life span N, it disappears at the end of turn T + N - 1? Or at the start of turn T + N?\n\nThe problem says: \"Disappears after N turns\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nAlso, in the context, it says \"including current\" for countdown decrease.\n\nLet me assume that at the beginning of turn T, the food has countdown C. Then during turn T, it can be eaten, and at the end of turn T, countdown decreases to C-1. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears before the next turn or something.\n\nBut for simplicity, since we act on each turn, I think: if at turn T, life span is L, then after this turn, it will have L-1 for next turn, and it exists as long as life span >0. So at turn T, with life span L, it can be eaten during turn T, and will disappear if not eaten by the time life span becomes 0.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" might mean that it lasts for N turns including the current one. For example, if N=1, it disappears after this turn, so it can only be eaten this turn.\n\nSimilarly, N=4 at turn 6 means it can be eaten in turns 6,7,8,9? Let's calculate:\n\n- Turn 6: life span 4, can be eaten\n\n- After turn 6, life span 3 for turn 7\n\n- Turn 7: life span 3, can be eaten\n\n- After turn 7, life span 2\n\n- Turn 8: life span 2, can be eaten\n\n- After turn 8, life span 1\n\n- Turn 9: life span 1, can be eaten\n\n- After turn 9, life span 0, disappears before turn 10.\n\nSo it can be eaten from turn 6 to turn 9 inclusive.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFood at (2,1): value 1, life span 4\n\nFood at (1,1): value 1, life span 5? Wait, the input says: \" (1, 1, 5, 1) \" let's see the format.\n\nFood Positions: ( (x,y), value, life_span )\n\nFor (1,1): ( (1,1), 5, 1 )? No, the input is: \"(1, 1, 5, 1)\" – I think it's (x,y, life_span, value) or what?\n\nLook: \" (2, 1, 4, 1) \" – probably (x, y, life_span, value)\n\nSimilarly, \" (1, 1, 5, 1) \" and \" (1, 6, 8, 1) \"\n\nAnd value is 1 for all, so all positive food? Value 1 means +1, since it says value1, value2, etc.\n\nIn the core rules, positive food has value +1, negative has -1, but here all have value 1, so all are positive food? But in the input, it says \"value1, value2\" and for (2,1,4,1) the last number is 1, similarly others, so value=1 for all, meaning all are positive food with +1 reward.\n\nBut let's confirm: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\" but in the state, it's written as \"(2,1,4,1)\" which might be (x,y,life_span,value) or (x,y,value,life_span)?\n\nInconsistency. Look at the state input:\n\n\"Food Positions, Life Span and Value: - (2, 1, 4, 1) - (1, 1, 5, 1) - (1, 6, 8, 1)\"\n\nAnd it says \"Life Span and Value\", so probably (x,y, life_span, value) for each.\n\nFor (2,1): x=2,y=1, life_span=4, value=1\n\n(1,1): x=1,y=1, life_span=5, value=1\n\n(1,6): x=1,y=6, life_span=8, value=1\n\nAll value=1, so all are positive food. No negative food here.\n\nLife spans: (2,1) lasts until turn 6+4-1=9? As I thought earlier.\n\nCurrent turn 6, life_span=4 for (2,1): it can be eaten from turn 6 to turn 9 (since after 4 turns, disappears).\n\nSimilarly, (1,1): life_span=5 at turn 6, so can be eaten from turn 6 to turn 10.\n\n(1,6): life_span=8 at turn 6, so can be eaten from turn 6 to turn 13.\n\nNow, snake positions: head at (3,1), body at (3,2), tail at (2,2). Head direction is down (D), so it moved down to (3,1) from previous position. Since head was at (3,2) before moving down to (3,1)? Positions are given as list: [(3,1), (3,2), (2,2)] with head first. So at turn 6, head is at (3,1), which it just moved to.\n\nHead direction is D, meaning it was moving down, so previous head was at (3,2), and it moved down to (3,1). Then body segments: after head, (3,2) is the first body segment, which was the previous head, and (2,2) is the tail.\n\nNow, the snake has 3 segments.\n\nPossible moves: since head is at (3,1), and direction is D (down), but we can choose to move in any direction except the opposite, because of no instant reverse.\n\nCurrent head direction is D, so we cannot move up (U) immediately, because that would be reverse.\n\nAllowed moves: from current direction D, we can move D, L, or R, but not U.\n\nNow, let's see the grid.\n\nValid coordinates: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except walls.\n\nWalls: border x=0,7 y=0,7, and internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nSo, for position (3,1):\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Up (U): (x,y+1) = (3,2) – but (3,2) is occupied by the body segment. Is that a collision?\n\nBody collision: if head touches any body segment, it dies. But there's an exception for the tail, because the tail moves.\n\nIn this case, moving to (3,2): currently, (3,2) is occupied by the first body segment.\n\nAfter we move, the snake will move: head moves to new position, then each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, and the tail segment is removed if no food eaten, or a new segment added if food eaten.\n\nStandard snake movement.\n\nIf I move up to (3,2), which is currently occupied by a body segment, but after movement, that segment will move to where the head was or something? Let's think carefully.\n\nAt the start of turn, snake positions: head (3,1), body (3,2), tail (2,2).\n\nIf I move to a new cell, say to cell X.\n\nIf X has food, then the snake grows: new head at X, and the tail stays, so positions become [X, (3,1), (3,2), (2,2)] – head moves to X, then the previous head becomes first body, etc., and tail remains since we add a segment.\n\nIf no food, head moves to X, body segments follow: so new head at X, then (3,1) becomes first body, (3,2) becomes second body, and (2,2) is removed since no growth.\n\nBut (2,2) is the tail, so it moves away.\n\nNow, collision: if the head moves to a cell occupied by a body segment, it dies, except if it's the tail cell and we are not eating food there or something? The core rules say:\n\n\"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, moving to the tail cell is allowed because when we move, the tail moves away, so no collision.\n\nBut if moving to a non-tail body segment, it's a collision because that segment doesn't move away immediately; only the tail does when we move.\n\nIn this case, for position (3,2): it is the first body segment, not the tail. Tail is at (2,2).\n\nSo if I move up to (3,2), which is occupied by the body at (3,2), and it's not the tail, so it should be a collision, death.\n\nSimilarly, if I move left or right or down.\n\nLet's list possible moves from (3,1):\n\n- Up (U): to (3,2) – but (3,2) is occupied by body, not tail, so collision, invalid.\n\n- Down (D): to (3,0) – but y=0 is wall, so wall collision, invalid.\n\n- Left (L): to (2,1) – what is at (2,1)? There is food at (2,1), but let's check if it's free.\n\n(2,1) is a cell, not occupied by snake? Snake positions are (3,1), (3,2), (2,2). So (2,1) is empty? Also, walls: x=2,y=1 is within 1-6, not wall, and no internal obstacle there, so (2,1) is free, but has food.\n\n- Right (R): to (4,1) – x=4,y=1, should be free? Snake: no, walls: border ok, internal obstacle at (5,6), not here, so free, no food.\n\nNow, also, cannot move up because of body, down because wall, so only possible moves are Left to (2,1) or Right to (4,1).\n\nBut to (2,1) there is food.\n\nNow, if I move left to (2,1), I eat the food there, since it's positive food, I grow.\n\nBut there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and new tail collide.\n\nFirst, let's see current state.\n\nHead at (3,1), tail at (2,2).\n\nIs head adjacent to tail? Adjacent means sharing a side, so (3,1) and (2,2): they share a corner, but not adjacent horizontally or vertically. (3,1) to (2,2) is diagonal, not adjacent; adjacent means up, down, left, right, so same row or column, differ by 1 in x or y.\n\nSo (3,1) and (2,2): |dx|=1, |dy|=1, so not adjacent; they are diagonal, which is not considered adjacent for this purpose, I think. Adjacent usually means Manhattan distance 1, so not diagonal.\n\nSo here, head (3,1) and tail (2,2) are not adjacent.\n\nTherefore, no tail reward danger for eating any food now.\n\nIf I move to (2,1), I eat the food at (2,1), which is positive, so I grow: new head at (2,1), and the tail stays, so new positions: head (2,1), then body (3,1), (3,2), and tail (2,2)? Let's sequence.\n\nAfter moving to (2,1) and eating food:\n\n- Head moves to (2,1)\n\n- Previous head (3,1) becomes first body segment\n\n- (3,2) becomes second body segment\n\n- Tail (2,2) remains, but since we ate food, we add a new segment at the tail? No.\n\nWhen we eat food, the snake grows: so the tail does not move, we add a new segment where the tail was, so the tail stays in place.\n\nStandard: when food eaten, head moves to food cell, the body follows, but the tail doesn't move, so we add a new segment.\n\nSo positions: new head at (2,1), then previous positions: the segment that was head is now first body: (3,1), then next was (3,2), which is now second body, and tail was (2,2), which remains as tail since no movement from there, so new snake: [(2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2)] – head, body, body, tail.\n\n(2,2) is still the tail, but now we have four segments.\n\nIf no food eaten, tail moves away.\n\nBut here, if I eat at (2,1), I grow.\n\nNow, the food at (2,1) is eaten, so it disappears.\n\nIf I move right to (4,1), no food, so no growth: head moves to (4,1), body: (3,1) becomes first body, (3,2) becomes second body, and tail (2,2) is removed, so new snake: [(4,1), (3,1), (3,2)] with head at (4,1), and direction would be R if I moved right.\n\nBut I need to think ahead 5+ turns.\n\nThe goal is to maximize score by eating food, but avoid risks, prioritize survival.\n\nNow, food available:\n\n- (2,1) with life span 4, value 1, can be eaten now or later.\n\n- (1,1) with life span 5, value 1\n\n- (1,6) with life span 8, value 1\n\n(1,6) is far away, y=6, while snake is at y=1, so need to move up.\n\nBut internal obstacle at (5,6), which might block access to some areas.\n\nAlso, walls.\n\nNow, current turn 6.\n\nI need to plan moves for multiple turns.\n\nBut the answer format is to output actions for turns starting from t1=6, and probably for several turns, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions for each turn starting from current.\n\nThe answer format is: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ... } so I need to specify a sequence of actions.\n\nHow many turns? It doesn't specify, but since I need to think ahead, I should plan for at least 5 turns or until a decision point.\n\nBut I can output multiple actions.\n\nSince the state changes, I need to simulate.\n\nBut let's start with current possible moves.\n\nFrom (3,1), I can only move L to (2,1) or R to (4,1), since U and D are invalid.\n\nIf I move L to (2,1), I eat the food, grow to length 4, and food at (2,1) is gone.\n\nThen snake positions: head at (2,1), body at (3,1), body at (3,2), tail at (2,2).\n\nHead is now at (2,1), and direction was D, but after moving L, the new direction is L.\n\nThen next turn, I can move from there.\n\nIf I move R to (4,1), no food, snake shortens to length 2? No, positions: head to (4,1), body: (3,1) becomes body, (3,2) becomes body, but since no food, tail is removed, so only two segments: head at (4,1) and body at (3,1), since (3,2) was the tail and is removed? Let's see: original positions: [(3,1), (3,2), (2,2)] \n\nAfter moving R to (4,1) no food:\n\n- Head moves to (4,1)\n\n- First body moves to previous head position: (3,1)\n\n- Second body (which was tail) moves to previous first body position: (3,2)\n\nBut since no growth, we remove the tail, meaning that the last segment is not there; so the new snake has segments: new head (4,1), then the segment that was at (3,1) is now the body, but (3,1) was the head, so it becomes the first body at (3,1)? I'm confusing myself.\n\nStandard: when no food, the head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in front.\n\nSo:\n\n- Head was at P0 = (3,1)\n\n- Body1 at P1 = (3,2)\n\n- Body2 at P2 = (2,2)  // tail\n\nAfter move to new head position N.\n\nIf no food, new head at N, new body1 at P0, new body2 at P1, and P2 is abandoned (tail removed).\n\nSo here, move to (4,1):\n\nNew head: (4,1)\n\nNew body1: previous head (3,1)\n\nNew body2: previous body1 (3,2)  // since P1\n\nAnd (2,2) is no longer part of snake.\n\nSo snake becomes: [(4,1), (3,1), (3,2)] with head at (4,1), body at (3,1), tail at (3,2).\n\nLength is 3? Original was 3 segments, after move no food, it should be same length, but tail is removed, so positions: two body segments? Segments: head, one body, one tail? Length is number of segments.\n\nOriginal: 3 segments.\n\nAfter no food eaten: still 3 segments, but the tail position changes.\n\nIn this case, new positions: head at (4,1), first body at (3,1), second body (tail) at (3,2).\n\nYes, so snake: [(4,1), (3,1), (3,2)]\n\nTail at (3,2).\n\nIf I had eaten food, it would be 4 segments.\n\nBack to decision.\n\nIf I move L to (2,1), I eat food, grow to 4 segments: positions [(2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2)]\n\nIf I move R to (4,1), no food, positions [(4,1), (3,1), (3,2)]\n\nNow, which is better?\n\nEating food gives +1 score and grows, which might be good for future, but growing could make it harder to maneuver if space is tight.\n\nBut here, the grid is 6x6, with one obstacle, so space is ok for now.\n\nBut we need to think long-term.\n\nAlso, there is food at (1,1) and (1,6) to consider.\n\n(1,1) is close, at (1,1), which is left and up from current, but we are at (3,1), so (1,1) is west.\n\n(1,6) is north-east, but y=6.\n\nNow, life spans: (2,1) can be eaten until turn 9, (1,1) until turn 10, (1,6) until turn 13, so all have time.\n\nBut (2,1) is right here, so I can eat it now.\n\nIf I don't eat it now, I might eat it later, but it might be riskier or I might lose it.\n\nBut since it has life span 4, I have until turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) has life span 5, so until turn 10.\n\nNow, if I move R to (4,1), I don't eat, and snake is at (4,1) with tail at (3,2).\n\nThen from there, I can move to other places.\n\nBut let's think about the tail reward danger for future.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving to (2,1) now.\n\nTurn 6: move L to (2,1)\n\nAfter this, snake: head (2,1), body (3,1), body (3,2), tail (2,2)\n\nFood at (2,1) is eaten, so removed.\n\nNow, head direction: since I moved L, new direction is L.\n\nAt turn 7, from (2,1), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (2,2) – but (2,2) is currently occupied by the tail.\n\nBut moving to tail cell is allowed, since tail will move.\n\nIf I move to (2,2), which is tail, and if I eat food there? But (2,2) has no food, I think. Food positions are (1,1), (1,6), and (2,1) is eaten.\n\n(2,2) has no food, so if I move to (2,2), since it's the tail, and no food there, then: head moves to (2,2), but (2,2) is the current tail position, so when I move there, since no food, the tail moves away to the previous position, so no collision.\n\nSpecifically: current positions: head (2,1), body (3,1), body (3,2), tail (2,2)\n\nIf I move U to (2,2):\n\n- Head moves to (2,2)\n\n- But (2,2) is current tail, and no food there, so when head moves to (2,2), the tail was at (2,2), but since no food, the tail moves to the previous position of the segment before it, which is (3,2)? Let's see:\n\nAfter move:\n\n- New head at (2,2)\n\n- First body at previous head position (2,1)\n\n- Second body at previous first body position (3,1)\n\n- And since no food, tail is removed, but previous tail was at (2,2), but head moved there, so the segment that was at (3,2) becomes the new tail? Positions:\n\nThe body segments: the segment that was at (3,1) moves to (2,1), which was head.\n\nThe segment that was at (3,2) moves to (3,1), which was first body.\n\nAnd the segment that was at (2,2) is no longer part of snake, since no growth.\n\nSo new snake: head at (2,2), body at (2,1), body at (3,1), tail at (3,2)? New positions: [(2,2), (2,1), (3,1)] because:\n\n- New head: (2,2)\n\n- New body1: previous head (2,1)\n\n- New body2: previous body1 (3,1)  // since the segment at (3,1) moves to where the head was, (2,1)\n\n- And previous body2 at (3,2) moves to where body1 was, (3,1)? Let's list:\n\nPrevious segments: index 0: head (2,1), index 1: body (3,1), index 2: body (3,2), index 3: tail (2,2) — I have four segments.\n\nSegments: position 0: head (2,1), position 1: body segment A (3,1), position 2: body segment B (3,2), position 3: tail segment C (2,2)\n\nWhen moving to new head position N.\n\nIf no food eaten, new head at N, new position 1 at old position 0, new position 2 at old position 1, and old position 3 is removed.\n\nSo for move U to (2,2): N = (2,2)\n\nOld position 0: (2,1) becomes new body at position 1\n\nOld position 1: (3,1) becomes new body at position 2\n\nOld position 2: (3,2) is not used; since no growth, we don't have a position for it, so it is removed, and old position 3: (2,2) is where head moved, but since no food, it's just occupied by head now.\n\nNew segments: new head at (2,2), new body at old pos0: (2,1), new body at old pos1: (3,1), and since no growth, we stop; the tail is at (3,1), which is the last body.\n\nOld position 2 and 3 are gone.\n\nSo new snake: head (2,2), body (2,1), body (3,1), and tail is (3,1)? No: positions: head at (2,2), first body at (2,1), second body at (3,1), so tail at (3,1).\n\nLength 3.\n\nIf I had eaten food, it would be different, but no food at (2,2).\n\nBack to turn 7 from (2,1): after turn 6 move L.\n\nAt turn 7, head at (2,1), direction L (since last move left).\n\nPossible moves: cannot move R (right) because opposite to L, so no instant reverse.\n\nCan move U, D, L.\n\n- U: to (2,2) - as above, it's the tail cell, but no food, so allowed, and after move, snake as above.\n\n- D: to (2,0) - y=0 is wall, invalid.\n\n- L: to (1,1) - (1,1) has food! And it's within grid.\n\n- R: to (3,1) - but (3,1) is occupied by body segment, not tail, so collision if move there.\n\nCurrent positions: head (2,1), body (3,1), body (3,2), tail (2,2)\n\n(3,1) is a body segment, not tail.\n\nSo moving R to (3,1) would be collision.\n\nMoving U to (2,2) is to tail, allowed.\n\nMoving D to (2,0) wall.\n\nMoving L to (1,1) free, has food.\n\nSo possible moves: U or L.\n\nIf I move L to (1,1), I eat the food there.\n\nThen I grow: new head at (1,1), new body at (2,1), new body at (3,1), new body at (3,2), and tail at (2,2) remains? When eating food, we add a segment.\n\nAfter move to (1,1) with food:\n\n- New head at (1,1)\n\n- New body at previous head (2,1)\n\n- New body at previous body1 (3,1)\n\n- New body at previous body2 (3,2)\n\n- And since food eaten, we add a new segment at the previous tail position, so new tail at (2,2)\n\nSo snake: [(1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2)] — five segments? Positions: head (1,1), body (2,1), body (3,1), body (3,2), tail (2,2)\n\nBut (2,2) is the tail, and (3,2) is body.\n\nThis might be messy.\n\nSince we ate food, the tail doesn't move, so we keep all segments and add one.\n\nFrom turn 6, if I moved L to (2,1), ate food, snake has 4 segments.\n\nAt turn 7, if I move L to (1,1), eat another food, then snake grows to 5 segments.\n\nHead at (1,1), which is corner, might be risky.\n\nIf at turn 7 I move U to (2,2), no food, snake shortens to 3 segments as before.\n\nThen from (2,2), I can go to other places.\n\nBut let's not get ahead; I need to consider the other option at turn 6.\n\nAt turn 6, instead of moving L, I can move R to (4,1).\n\nTurn 6: move R to (4,1), no food.\n\nSnake: head (4,1), body (3,1), tail (3,2) — positions [(4,1), (3,1), (3,2)]\n\nHead direction now R.\n\nTurn 7, from (4,1), possible moves:\n\nCurrent direction R, so cannot move L (left).\n\nCan move U, D, R.\n\n- U: to (4,2) - what is there? Currently, snake at (4,1),(3,1),(3,2), so (4,2) is free? Walls: x=4,y=2, valid, no obstacle, no food, so free.\n\n- D: to (4,0) - y=0 wall, invalid.\n\n- R: to (5,1) - x=5,y=1, valid, no food, free.\n\n- L: to (3,1) - but (3,1) is occupied by body, not tail, so collision.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (4,2) or R to (5,1).\n\nNow, to think long-term, I need to consider which path allows me to eat more food and survive.\n\nThere is food at (1,6) with long life span, but it's far.\n\nAlso, the grid has limited space.\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nGrid 6x6: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\nWalls at borders, obstacle at (5,6).\n\nFood at: (1,1), (1,6), and (2,1) but (2,1) can be eaten now.\n\nSnake current: head (3,1), body (3,2), tail (2,2).\n\nAfter turn 6, if I move L to (2,1), I eat (2,1), grow, head at (2,1), body (3,1), body (3,2), tail (2,2).\n\nThen at turn 7, I can move L to (1,1) to eat (1,1) or U to (2,2).\n\nIf I eat (1,1), I grow to 5 segments, head at (1,1), which is corner, then I can only move up or right, but up to (1,2), which might be free.\n\nThen from there, I can go towards (1,6).\n\nBut with long snake, it might be hard to turn.\n\nIf I don't eat (1,1) now, it has life span 5, so I can eat it later.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) has life span 8.\n\nBut let's consider the risk.\n\nAnother thing: the tail reward danger.\n\nFor example, if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has food, eating it kills.\n\nBut currently, no such situation.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should eat the available food.\n\nBut eating both (2,1) and (1,1) quickly might box me in.\n\nLet's simulate the move to (4,1) first.\n\nTurn 6: move R to (4,1), no food, snake: [(4,1), (3,1), (3,2)] head at (4,1), tail at (3,2)\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 7: from (4,1), move U to (4,2) or R to (5,1).\n\nIf move U to (4,2): no food, snake moves: head to (4,2), body to (4,1), tail to (3,1)? Positions: new head (4,2), new body at (4,1), new tail at (3,1) — since previous body (3,1) moves to where head was (4,1), and (3,2) is removed? Previous: head (4,1), body (3,1), tail (3,2)\n\nAfter move U to (4,2) no food:\n\nNew head: (4,2)\n\nNew body: previous head (4,1)\n\nNew tail: previous body (3,1)  // since tail was (3,2), but no growth, so not added, and the segment at (3,1) moves to (4,1), and (3,2) is removed.\n\nNew positions: [(4,2), (4,1), (3,1)] with tail at (3,1)\n\nHead at (4,2), direction U.\n\nThen turn 8, from (4,2), can move U, D, L, R except opposite? Last move U, so cannot move D.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U to (4,3)\n\n- D to (4,1) but (4,1) is occupied by body, not tail, so collision.\n\n- L to (3,2) - (3,2) is free now? Previously occupied, but removed, so free.\n\n- R to (5,2)\n\nAll could be valid, but D to (4,1) is body, collision.\n\nU to (4,3): free, no food\n\nL to (3,2): free, no food\n\nR to (5,2): free, no food\n\netc.\n\nBut no food nearby, so I need to go towards (1,6) or something.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 7 I moved R to (5,1), from (4,1).\n\nMove R to (5,1), no food, snake: new head (5,1), body (4,1), tail (3,1) — previous tail (3,2) removed, so [(5,1), (4,1), (3,1)]\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen turn 8, from (5,1), can move U, D, R, not L (opposite).\n\n- U to (5,2)\n\n- D to (5,0) wall\n\n- R to (6,1) - x=6,y=1, valid, but x=6 is border? Walls: x=7 is wall, so x=6 is valid, since walls at x=0 and x=7, so x=1 to 6 are playable, similarly y=1 to 6.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to 6 are free, except obstacles.\n\n(6,1) is free, no food.\n\n- L to (4,1) body, collision.\n\nSo moves U or R.\n\nIf move R to (6,1), then head at (6,1), corner.\n\nThen limited moves.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo better to move U at some point to go towards (1,6).\n\nBut let's go back to turn 6 decision.\n\nAt turn 6, if I move L to (2,1), I eat food, score +1, length 4.\n\nThen at turn 7, I can choose to move L to (1,1) to eat another food, or move U to (2,2) to avoid eating now.\n\nIf I move U to (2,2) at turn 7, no food, snake shortens to 3 segments: head (2,2), body (2,1), tail (3,1) as earlier.\n\nThen from (2,2), I can move to other directions.\n\nBut (1,1) is still there, I can eat it later.\n\nSince (1,1) has life span 5, I can eat it by turn 10.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6) by turn 13.\n\nBut to reach (1,6) from south, I need to go up.\n\nAlso, there is an obstacle at (5,6), which blocks the top-right corner.\n\n(5,6) is occupied, so I cannot go there.\n\nNow, let's plan to eat (1,6) eventually.\n\nBut first, let's see if I can eat both (2,1) and (1,1) safely.\n\nTurn 6: move L to (2,1), eat food, snake: [(2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2)] head (2,1), tail (2,2)\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 7: move L to (1,1), eat food at (1,1), grow.\n\nNew head at (1,1), new body at (2,1), new body at (3,1), new body at (3,2), new tail at (2,2) — positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2)]\n\nBut (2,2) is tail, and (1,1) is head.\n\nNow, the snake has a loop or something? Positions: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) — so it's like a C shape or something.\n\nFrom (1,1) to (2,1) to (3,1) to (3,2) to (2,2).\n\nHead at (1,1), tail at (2,2).\n\nAt turn 8, head at (1,1), last move L, so direction L.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U to (1,2) - free? Assuming no walls or snake, (1,2) should be free.\n\n- D to (1,0) wall, invalid.\n\n- L to (0,1) wall, invalid.\n\n- R to (2,1) - but (2,1) is occupied by body segment, not tail, so collision.\n\nSo only possible move is U to (1,2).\n\nMust move U to (1,2).\n\nNo food there, so move to (1,2), no food.\n\nThen snake moves: new head (1,2), new body at (1,1), new body at (2,1), new body at (3,1), and tail at (3,2)? Previous tail (2,2) moves to where the previous segment was.\n\nPrevious positions: head (1,1), body (2,1), body (3,1), body (3,2), tail (2,2)\n\nAfter move to (1,2) no food:\n\nNew head: (1,2)\n\nNew body1: old head (1,1)\n\nNew body2: old body1 (2,1)\n\nNew body3: old body2 (3,1)\n\nAnd since no growth, tail is removed, so old body3 (3,2) moves to where body2 was? Old body2 is (3,1), so new body3 at (3,1)? Let's:\n\nNew segments: new head at (1,2)\n\nNew body at old pos0: (1,1)\n\nNew body at old pos1: (2,1)\n\nNew body at old pos2: (3,1)  // old body2 at (3,1)\n\nOld pos3: (3,2) and old tail (2,2) are not used; since no growth, we have only the first four segments for body, but we remove the last one.\n\nSince no food, the last segment is removed.\n\nHere, old segments: 0: (1,1), 1: (2,1), 2: (3,1), 3: (3,2), 4: (2,2) — five segments.\n\nAfter move no food:\n\nNew head at N = (1,2)\n\nNew body at old pos0: (1,1)\n\nNew body at old pos1: (2,1)\n\nNew body at old pos2: (3,1)\n\nAnd old pos3 and pos4 are removed; no new tail from old.\n\nSo new snake has three body segments? New head at (1,2), new body at (1,1), new body at (2,1), new body at (3,1), so tail at (3,1).\n\nPositions: [(1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1)] with tail at (3,1)\n\nLength 4.\n\nHead at (1,2), direction U.\n\nTurn 9, from (1,2), can move U, D, L, R except opposite to U, so cannot D.\n\n- U to (1,3)\n\n- D to (1,1) but (1,1) is occupied by body, collision.\n\n- L to (0,2) wall\n\n- R to (2,2) - (2,2) is free now? Previously tail, but removed, so free. No food.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (1,3) or R to (2,2).\n\nIf move U to (1,3), continue up.\n\nIf move R to (2,2), then from there can go to other places.\n\nBut to reach (1,6), I need to go up, so moving U is better.\n\nSimilarly, I can keep moving up to (1,6).\n\nBut there is food at (1,6), so I can eat it when I reach.\n\nBut the snake is long, and the grid has obstacles.\n\nFrom (1,2), move U to (1,3) at turn 9, no food, snake: new head (1,3), body (1,2), body (1,1), tail (2,1)? Positions: new head (1,3), new body at (1,2), new body at (1,1), new body at (2,1), tail at (2,1)? After move: new head (1,3), new body1 (1,2), new body2 (1,1), new body3 (2,1), tail at (2,1) — but (2,1) is a single position.\n\nTail at (2,1).\n\nThen turn 10, from (1,3), move U to (1,4), and so on, to (1,5), then (1,6) at some point.\n\nBut at (1,6), I can eat the food.\n\nLife span of (1,6) is 8 at turn 6, so at turn 6+7=13? Life span 8 at turn 6, can be eaten until turn 13.\n\nTurn 6: life span 8, after turn 6: life span 7, ..., at turn 13: life span 1, can be eaten, after that disappears.\n\nSo I have time to reach.\n\nBut let's see how many turns to reach (1,6) from current.\n\nAt turn 6, after eating (2,1) and (1,1), head at (1,1) turn 7? Let's timeline.\n\nTurn 6: move to (2,1), eat, head at (2,1)\n\nTurn 7: move to (1,1), eat, head at (1,1)\n\nTurn 8: move to (1,2), head at (1,2)\n\nTurn 9: move to (1,3), head at (1,3)\n\nTurn 10: move to (1,4), head at (1,4)\n\nTurn 11: move to (1,5), head at (1,5)\n\nTurn 12: move to (1,6), eat food at (1,6), grow.\n\nSo at turn 12, I eat (1,6), score +1.\n\nTotal score from food: ate (2,1), (1,1), (1,6), so 3 points.\n\nBut is this safe? At turn 12, when I move to (1,6), it should be ok, as long as no collision.\n\nDuring this path, from (1,1) to (1,6) along y-axis, the body follows, but since I'm moving straight, it should be fine, no self-collision.\n\nFor example, when at (1,3), body at (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), etc., all positions are distinct, so no problem.\n\nAfter eating (1,6), snake is longer, and I need to find a way out.\n\nBut (1,6) is corner, so I can only move down or right, but right to (2,6), which might be free.\n\nThen I can explore.\n\nBut there is an obstacle at (5,6), so I can go down from (1,6) to (1,5), but (1,5) might be occupied by body soon.\n\nAfter eating at (1,6), positions: head at (1,6), body at (1,5)? Let's see when I move to (1,6) at turn 12.\n\nBefore move, at turn 11, head at (1,5), positions: let's say from turn 11.\n\nAt turn 11, after moving to (1,5): head at (1,5), body at (1,4), body at (1,3), body at (1,2), tail at (1,1) or something.\n\nSince I moved up each turn, the body is lining up.\n\nAt turn 12, move to (1,6), eat food, so grow: new head at (1,6), new body at (1,5), new body at (1,4), etc., and add new segment, so tail at previous tail position.\n\nBut previous tail was at, say, (1,1) or wherever.\n\nPositions will be from (1,6) to (1,1) vertically, with length depending.\n\nBut after eating, I can move down to (1,5), but (1,5) is body, collision, or move right to (2,6).\n\nMove right to (2,6), which is free, then continue.\n\nBut the grid has space, so it might be ok.\n\nBut let's see the alternative at turn 6.\n\nIf at turn 6 I move R to (4,1), no eat.\n\nThen snake at (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)\n\nTurn 7, I can move U to (4,2) or R to (5,1).\n\nSuppose move U to (4,2), no food, snake: head (4,2), body (4,1), tail (3,1)\n\nThen turn 8, from (4,2), move U to (4,3), say.\n\nContinue up to (4,4), etc.\n\nBut to eat (1,6), I need to go left and up.\n\nFrom (4,2), I can move L to (3,2) or U to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut (1,6) is at (1,6), so I need to move west and north.\n\nBut with shorter snake, it's easier.\n\nAlso, I can eat (1,1) later.\n\nFor example, from current, if I go to (4,1), then to (4,2), then to (3,2), etc., but (3,2) might be occupied.\n\nAt turn 6, after move R, snake at (4,1), (3,1), (3,2)\n\nAt turn 7, move U to (4,2), snake: (4,2), (4,1), (3,1)\n\nTurn 8, move L to (3,2)? (3,2) is free now, move to (3,2), no food, snake: head (3,2), body (4,2), tail (4,1)? New head (3,2), body (4,2), tail (4,1) — positions [(3,2), (4,2), (4,1)]\n\nThen from (3,2), can move U, D, L, R.\n\n- U to (3,3)\n\n- D to (3,1) but (3,1) is free? Previously occupied, but removed, so free.\n\n- L to (2,2) free\n\n- R to (4,2) body, collision.\n\nSo can move U, D, L.\n\n(1,1) is at (1,1), so I can move L to (2,2), then down to (2,1), then left to (1,1).\n\nBut at (2,1) there is food, which I can eat.\n\n(2,1) food is there with life span 4 at turn 6, so at turn 8, life span decreases.\n\nTurn 6: life span 4\n\nTurn 7: after turn 6, life span 3 for turn 7\n\nTurn 8: life span 2\n\nTurn 9: life span 1\n\nTurn 10: disappears\n\nSo at turn 8, I can eat (2,1) if I reach.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) life span 5 at turn 6, turn 8: life span 3, etc.\n\nFrom above, at turn 8, head at (3,2), I can move L to (2,2), no food, then snake: head (2,2), body (3,2), tail (4,2)? Positions: new head (2,2), body (3,2), tail (4,2) — [(2,2), (3,2), (4,2)] tail at (4,2)\n\nThen turn 9, from (2,2), move D to (2,1) to eat food at (2,1), or move other directions.\n\nMove D to (2,1), eat food, grow: new head (2,1), body (2,2), body (3,2), tail (4,2), and add new segment, so new tail at (4,2)? After eating: new head (2,1), new body at (2,2), new body at (3,2), new body at (4,2), so tail at (4,2)\n\nLength 4.\n\nThen from (2,1), I can move L to (1,1) to eat another food.\n\nMove L to (1,1), eat, grow to 5 segments.\n\nThen similar to before, head at (1,1), must move U to (1,2), and so on to (1,6).\n\nSame as the first path, but delayed by a few turns, and I ate (2,1) later, but still ate it.\n\nIn terms of score, I eat all three foods in both cases.\n\nIn the first case, I ate (2,1) at turn 6, (1,1) at turn 7, (1,6) at turn 12.\n\nIn this case, ate (2,1) at turn 9, (1,1) at turn 10, (1,6) later.\n\nBut (2,1) life span allows until turn 9, so turn 9 is last chance.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) until turn 10.\n\nIn the second path, at turn 9 I eat (2,1), turn 10 eat (1,1), then to (1,6) by turn 15 or so, but (1,6) life span 8 at turn 6, turn 15 is turn 6+9=15, life span decreases: at turn 6:8, turn7:7, ..., turn13:1, turn14:0 disappeared, so at turn 14, it's gone, so I can eat until turn 13.\n\nIf I start from (1,1) at turn 10, head at (1,1), then to (1,2) turn11, (1,3) turn12, (1,4) turn13, (1,5) turn14, but at turn14, (1,6) is gone, life span 0, so I miss (1,6).\n\nAt turn13: head at (1,4) say, not at (1,6).\n\nFrom (1,1) at turn10, move U to (1,2) turn11, (1,3) turn12, (1,4) turn13, then (1,5) turn14, but (1,6) disappeared before turn14.\n\nDisappears after N turns, so at turn13, if life span was 1 at turn13, can be eaten during turn13.\n\nAt turn6: life span 8\n\nTurn7: 7\n\n...\n\nTurn13: 1, can be eaten\n\nAfter turn13, disappears, so not available at turn14.\n\nSo to eat (1,6), must be at turn13 or before.\n\nFrom (1,1) at turn10, I need 3 moves to reach (1,4) at turn13, but (1,6) is at y=6, so from (1,1) to (1,6) is 5 moves up: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6).\n\nSo turn10: at (1,1)\n\nTurn11: move to (1,2)\n\nTurn12: to (1,3)\n\nTurn13: to (1,4) — not (1,6)\n\nTo reach (1,6) at turn13, I need to be closer earlier.\n\nIn the first path, I was at (1,1) at turn7, then moved up each turn: turn8 (1,2), turn9 (1,3), turn10 (1,4), turn11 (1,5), turn12 (1,6) — ate at turn12.\n\nAt turn12, (1,6) life span: at turn6:8, turn12 is turn6+6, so life span 8-6=2? At turn t, life span decreases each turn.\n\nAt turn6: life span 8\n\nAfter turn6: 7 for turn7\n\nTurn7: 7\n\nAfter turn7: 6 for turn8\n\n...\n\nAt turn12: life span at start: 8 - (12-6) = 2? Since decreased by 1 each turn from turn6 to turn12, 6 turns later, so life span = 8 - 6 = 2 at turn12.\n\nCan be eaten.\n\nSimilarly, at turn13: life span 1.\n\nSo in first path, I ate at turn12.\n\nIn the delayed path, if I eat (1,1) at turn10, I can only reach (1,4) by turn13, not (1,6), so I miss (1,6) because I can't reach in time.\n\nTherefore, to eat (1,6), I need to be moving towards it earlier.\n\nIn the first choice, by eating (2,1) and (1,1) early, I can reach (1,6) by turn12 and eat it.\n\nIn the second choice, if I go to (4,1) first, I might not reach (1,6) in time or it's tighter.\n\nMoreover, in the second path, I still eat (2,1) and (1,1), but (1,6) might be missed.\n\nUnless I go directly to (1,6) without eating (1,1) first.\n\nBut (1,1) is on the way.\n\nFor example, from turn6 move R to (4,1), then move up and left to go to (1,6).\n\nBut it takes more turns.\n\nSay turn6: (4,1)\n\nTurn7: move U to (4,2)\n\nTurn8: move U to (4,3)\n\nTurn9: move L to (3,3) or something, but to reach (1,6), I need to decrease x and increase y.\n\nFrom (4,3), move L to (3,3), then (2,3), (1,3), then up to (1,6).\n\nBut at (1,3), I can eat (1,1)? No, (1,1) is south.\n\nI might pass (1,1) but not eat it if I go directly north.\n\nBut (1,1) has value, so I should eat it if possible.\n\nBut with time constraint for (1,6).\n\nIf I go directly to (1,6), from current (3,1) at turn6.\n\nIf move R to (4,1) turn6\n\nThen U to (4,2) turn7\n\nU to (4,3) turn8\n\nL to (3,3) turn9\n\nL to (2,3) turn10\n\nL to (1,3) turn11\n\nU to (1,4) turn12\n\nU to (1,5) turn13\n\nU to (1,6) turn14\n\nBut at turn14, (1,6) life span: at turn13 it was 1, eaten at turn13, but at turn14, it disappears before, so not available turn14.\n\nAt turn13: life span 1, can be eaten during turn13.\n\nBut at turn13, I am at (1,5), move to (1,6) at turn14? No.\n\nAt turn13, if I am at (1,5), I can move to (1,6) during turn13, so eat at turn13.\n\nIn the sequence: turn13: from (1,4)? Let's correct.\n\nFrom turn11: at (1,3) after move L from (2,3)? Timeline:\n\nTurn6: move R to (4,1), head (4,1)\n\nTurn7: move U to (4,2), head (4,2)\n\nTurn8: move U to (4,3), head (4,3)\n\nTurn9: move L to (3,3), head (3,3)\n\nTurn10: move L to (2,3), head (2,3)\n\nTurn11: move L to (1,3), head (1,3)\n\nTurn12: move U to (1,4), head (1,4)\n\nTurn13: move U to (1,5), head (1,5) — but to eat (1,6), I need to be at (1,6).\n\nAt turn13, from (1,4), I move to (1,5) or directly to (1,6) if possible, but from (1,4), I can move U to (1,5) or to (1,6)? No, only adjacent.\n\nFrom (1,4) at turn12, move U to (1,5) at turn13, then from (1,5) at turn13, I can move U to (1,6) at turn14, but turn14 (1,6) gone.\n\nAt turn13, from (1,4), I move directly to (1,5), not to (1,6).\n\nTo reach (1,6) at turn13, I need to be at (1,5) at turn12.\n\nFrom above, at turn12, I am at (1,4), not (1,5).\n\nSo I can only reach (1,5) at turn13, and (1,6) at turn14, too late.\n\nTherefore, in this path, I cannot eat (1,6) because I start later.\n\nIf at some point I move faster, but I have to move one step per turn.\n\nSo only by being at (1,1) earlier can I reach (1,6) in time.\n\nThus, the first strategy is better: eat (2,1) and (1,1) early, then go up to (1,6).\n\nMoreover, in the first path, I have a longer snake, but I can manage.\n\nNow, about the tail reward danger: when I am about to eat (1,6), head at (1,5), tail at some position.\n\nAt that point, if tail is adjacent and has food, but in this case, no food on tail cell, so should be fine.\n\nSimilarly, no other risks apparent.\n\nTherefore, at turn 6, I should move left to (2,1) to eat the food.\n\nThen the sequence:\n\nTurn 6: move L to (2,1)\n\nThen turn 7: move L to (1,1) to eat that food\n\nThen turn 8: move U to (1,2)\n\nTurn 9: move U to (1,3)\n\nTurn 10: move U to (1,4)\n\nTurn 11: move U to (1,5)\n\nTurn 12: move U to (1,6) to eat that food.\n\nI need to output actions for turns starting from t1=6.\n\nBut how many turns? Probably until I eat or for several turns.\n\nSince after turn 12, I need to continue, but the food is eaten, so I can stop or continue.\n\nBut to be complete, I can output up to turn 12.\n\nBut the answer should be a sequence.\n\nSince thinking 5+ turns ahead, I can output for 5 turns or more.\n\nBut in this case, from turn 6 to turn 12 is 7 turns.\n\nI can output the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 8 to 11, I move up repeatedly.\n\nBut I need to specify each turn.\n\nAlso, at turn 7, after moving to (1,1), the direction is L, then at turn 8, I move U, which is not opposite, since opposite would be R, so allowed.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nNow, what about the internal obstacle at (5,6)? It doesn't affect this path since I'm on the left side.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the plan is to move left at turn 6, left at turn 7, then up for five turns to (1,6).\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 6: L\n\nTurn 7: L\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nBut at turn 12, I move to (1,6) and eat, but I need to output actions, and after that, I can stop or continue.\n\nSince the question is to output for the turns, I think up to turn 12 is fine, as I eat the last food.\n\nBut to be precise, I should output the sequence for the immediate actions with the plan.\n\nSince the answer format might expect multiple turns, but not specified.\n\nI think outputting from turn 6 to turn 12 is acceptable.\n\nTo save space, I could output until the key actions.\n\nBut I think full sequence is better.\n\nAnother thing: in the first move, when I move L to (2,1), is there any risk? Head was at (3,1), moving to (2,1), which has food, and I eat, grow. No collision, as we checked.\n\nSimilarly, moving to (1,1) at turn 7, no issue.\n\nThen moving up, no problem.\n\nSo I think this is safe and maximizes score by eating all three foods.\n\nIf I don't eat (2,1) now, I might not get all, as per the second path.\n\nTherefore, I should do this.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating all available positive food while ensuring long-term survival, the strategy involves eating the food at (2,1) and (1,1) early to allow sufficient time to reach and eat the food at (1,6) before it disappears. The food at (1,6) has a life span of 8 at turn 6, meaning it must be eaten by turn 13 (as life span decreases each turn, including the current turn). By moving left to (2,1) on turn 6 and left to (1,1) on turn 7, the snake eats these foods and grows, positioning itself to move upward efficiently toward (1,6). Moving directly upward from (1,1) to (1,6) over the next turns ensures the snake reaches (1,6) by turn 12 to eat it safely.\n\nThe sequence of actions is planned for 7 turns (turns 6 to 12) to cover the key movements, including eating all foods. After turn 12, the snake can continue moving to avoid collisions, but the primary goal of eating all food is achieved by turn 12.\n\n- **Turn 6**: Move left (L) to (2,1) to eat the positive food there (value +1, life span 4). This grows the snake to length 4. The head direction changes to L.\n- **Turn 7**: Move left (L) to (1,1) to eat the positive food there (value +1, life span 5). This grows the snake to length 5. The head direction changes to L.\n- **Turn 8**: Move up (U) to (1,2). No food, so no growth. The head direction changes to U.\n- **Turn 9**: Move up (U) to (1,3). No food, so no growth.\n- **Turn 10**: Move up (U) to (1,4). No food, so no growth.\n- **Turn 11**: Move up (U) to (1,5). No food, so no growth.\n- **Turn 12**: Move up (U) to (1,6) to eat the positive food there (value +1, life span 8). This grows the snake to length 6.\n\nThis plan eats all three foods, scoring +3, and avoids all risks:\n- No collisions: Movements are into free cells or the tail cell when safe (e.g., no body collisions or wall hits).\n- No instant reverse: Direction changes are valid (e.g., from L to U on turn 8 is allowed as U is not opposite to L).\n- Tail reward danger: Not applicable, as the tail cell never has food when the head is adjacent during this sequence.\n- Life spans honored: (2,1) eaten on turn 6 (within life span 4, valid until turn 9), (1,1) eaten on turn 7 (within life span 5, valid until turn 10), (1,6) eaten on turn 12 (within life span 8, valid until turn 13).\n\nThe internal obstacle at (5,6) and border walls do not affect this path, as the snake remains on the left side of the grid (x=1-2, y=1-6).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 7: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 8: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 9: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 10: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 11: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 12: U (up)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 7, and the grid has walls and obstacles. The border walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is 8x8 from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (2,1), then (3,1), (3,2), (2,2). So the snake has 4 segments. Head direction is left, meaning it was moving left last turn.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (1,1) with life span 4, value +1 (positive food)\n\n- (1,6) with life span 7, value +1\n\n- (3,5) with life span 10, value +1\n\nAll food is positive here, no negative food mentioned.\n\nI need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns. But the answer format says to list actions starting from turn t1, which is 7, and probably for a few turns. Since it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan a sequence but only output the actions for the turns specified, but it doesn't specify how many to output. Looking back: \"Answer Format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but it doesn't say how many. I think I need to output for a few turns, but since it's about planning ahead, I should simulate multiple steps.\n\nPerhaps I should output actions until a decision point or for 5 turns, but it's not specified. I'll assume I need to provide actions for the next, say, 5 turns or so, based on the plan.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid. I'll make a small grid representation for clarity.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nSnake: head (2,1), then body: (3,1), (3,2), (2,2). So let's plot this.\n\nAssuming (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? Usually in coordinates, (0,0) might be bottom-left, but in grids, it can vary. Since y=0 and y=7 are borders, and snake has y=1,2, it might be y increasing upwards or downwards? Head direction is L, which is left, so x decreasing.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I'll define:\n\n- x: from left to right, 0 to 7\n\n- y: from bottom to top? Or top to bottom? The movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), so if y increases upwards, D is down, U is up.\n\nIn the state, head direction L, and positions: (2,1) head, then (3,1), so (3,1) is to the right of head, since head at (2,1) and moving left to (2,1)? Last move was left, so head was at (3,1) turn before, moved left to (2,1) this turn? Let's see the positions.\n\nSnake positions: [(2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2)]\n\nHead at (2,1), next segment (3,1), which is right of head? x=3 vs x=2, so if x increases right, (3,1) is east of (2,1), so the body is to the right, meaning the snake was moving left to reach (2,1).\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) is above (3,1) if y increases up, or below if y increases down.\n\n(3,1) to (3,2): if y=2 > y=1, and it's the next segment, so if snake was moving, from (3,2) to (3,1) or what? Positions are head first, so head (2,1), then (3,1), so the second segment is at (3,1), which was the previous head position.\n\nThen third segment (3,2), which was before that, and fourth (2,2).\n\nSo let's trace the snake's path:\n\n- At some point, head was at (3,2), moved down to (3,1)? Or how.\n\nFrom positions: the body segments show the path. From head (2,1), connected to (3,1), so it came from (3,1) to (2,1) moving left.\n\nThen (3,1) is connected to (3,2), so it came from (3,2) to (3,1) moving down (if y increases up, decreasing y is down).\n\nThen (3,2) connected to (2,2), so from (2,2) to (3,2) moving right? Or to (3,2) from where.\n\nThe positions are listed in order: index 0: head (2,1), index 1: (3,1), index 2: (3,2), index 3: (2,2).\n\nSo the tail is at (2,2).\n\nThe snake body: from head to tail: (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (2,2)\n\nSo the segment at (3,1) is adjacent to head and to (3,2).\n\nFrom (2,1) to (3,1) is east, so the direction from body to head is west, meaning head moved west to current position.\n\nThen from (3,1) to (3,2): if y=2 > y=1, and y increases up, then (3,2) is north of (3,1), so the snake moved south from (3,2) to (3,1).\n\nSimilarly, from (3,2) to (2,2): x=2<3, so west, so moved east from (2,2) to (3,2).\n\nThe tail is at (2,2), and it was moving east to (3,2) before, but now it's stationary except when moving.\n\nFor movement, we care about the head direction for the no reverse rule.\n\nHead direction is given as L, meaning last move was left to (2,1).\n\nSo current head at (2,1), facing left.\n\nNow, possible moves: since last move was left (L), I cannot move right (opposite) immediately, so no R. Allowed moves: U, D, L (since not opposite).\n\nNo instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is the last move direction, which is L, so I can move U, D, or L, but not R.\n\nNow, let's see the grid state.\n\nFood:\n\n- (1,1) : value +1, life span 4. Since current turn t=7, it disappears after N turns, countdown decreases each turn including current, so life span 4 means it will disappear after turn 7+4-1? Let's clarify.\n\nFood life span: \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo at turn t, food with life span L will disappear after turn t + L - 1? Or at turn t + L?\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so if at turn t, life span is N, then:\n\n- After turn t, countdown becomes N-1\n\n- After turn t+1, N-2, ..., after turn t+(N-1), countdown 0, then disappears, so it is present from turn t to turn t + N - 1, and gone at turn t + N.\n\nFor example, at turn 7, life span 4, so it will be present on turns 7,8,9,10 (since countdown 4,3,2,1), and gone on turn 11.\n\nSimilarly, life span 7: present turns 7 to 13, gone turn 14.\n\nLife span 10: turns 7 to 16, gone 17.\n\nAll food has value +1, so all are good to eat.\n\nNow, positions:\n\nHead at (2,1). Possible moves: U, D, L (since not R allowed).\n\nU: (2,1) to (2,2) — but (2,2) is the tail! Is this safe?\n\nBody collision: head touches any body segment except that it can move into the tail cell because the tail will move away.\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo moving to tail is safe, as long as after move, the tail moves, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, other body parts, collision if head touches.\n\nNow, (2,2) is the tail, so moving to (2,2) is possible and safe, because after move, head is at (2,2), and tail moves from (2,2) to where? When head moves, if it doesn't eat food, tail moves forward, so the tail segment at (2,2) will be removed, and new tail is the previous one, but since head moves to (2,2), which was tail, and tail moves away, so no issue.\n\nSpecifically: if head moves to a cell not food, then snake moves: head to new position, tail is removed. So if head moves to tail position, since tail was there, but after move, that cell has head, and the old tail is gone, so no collision.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, other moves:\n\nL: left to (1,1)\n\nU: up to (2,2) — which is tail\n\nD: down to (2,0) — but y=0 is wall, so invalid, collision.\n\nx=2, y=0: y=0 is border wall, so cannot move there.\n\nSo possible moves from (2,1):\n\n- L: to (1,1)\n\n- U: to (2,2) — tail\n\n- D: to (2,0) — wall, invalid\n\n- R: not allowed, opposite direction.\n\nSo only two choices: L or U.\n\nL to (1,1): that is a food position! (1,1) has food.\n\nU to (2,2): tail position, no food there.\n\nIf I move L to (1,1), I eat the food there, since head moves to (1,1) which has food, so I consume it, snake grows: new head at (1,1), and the tail does not move, so snake length increases by one. Positions become: [(1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2)] — after growth, the segment added at head, so body includes the previous head.\n\nStandard: when eat food, head moves to food cell, new segment added where head was, so tail remains.\n\nSo after eating at (1,1): new positions: head (1,1), then (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) — tail at (2,2).\n\nLength 5 now.\n\nIf I move U to (2,2), no food, so head moves to (2,2), tail moves from (2,2) to the next, which is (3,2)? Positions: current snake: [(2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2)]\n\nIf head moves to (2,2), which is the current tail, and no food, so tail is removed. The new head is (2,2), and the body: previous head (2,1) becomes second segment, then (3,1), then (3,2) becomes the new tail? Let's see the sequence.\n\nAfter move: head moves to (2,2), so positions: new head (2,2), then the previous segments except tail is removed, so the body is [ (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) ] — (2,1) is now second, (3,1) third, (3,2) tail.\n\nSince (2,2) was tail and we moved there, it's consumed, so the segment at (2,2) is gone, and head is now there.\n\nNew positions: head at (2,2), then (2,1), then (3,1), then (3,2) as tail.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, back to choices.\n\nIf I move L to (1,1), I eat the food, grow to length 5.\n\nBut there's a risk: the food at (1,1) has life span 4, which is short, but I can eat it now.\n\nAlso, note the tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills.\n\nBut here, tail is at (2,2), head at (2,1), not adjacent? Adjacent means sharing a side, so (2,1) and (2,2) are adjacent vertically? y differs by 1, x same, so yes, adjacent.\n\nHead at (2,1), tail at (2,2), which is above if y up, so |dx| + |dy| =1, adjacent.\n\nBut the food is not on the tail; the food is at (1,1), separate.\n\nTail reward danger only if the tail cell itself has food and head is adjacent, then moving to eat it causes collision because after eating, tail grows and head is on the same cell or something.\n\nRule: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nBut here, the tail is at (2,2), and there is no food at (2,2), so no issue.\n\nFood at (1,1), not on tail.\n\nSo moving to (1,1) is fine.\n\nAfter moving to (1,1), I eat the food, grow, positions: head (1,1), body (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) — tail (2,2).\n\nHead direction: I moved left, so new head direction L.\n\nLife span of food (1,1) was 4, but I eat it at turn 7, so it's consumed, gone.\n\nOther food: (1,6) and (3,5).\n\n(1,6) life span 7, so present until turn 13.\n\n(3,5) life span 10, until turn 16.\n\nNow, if I move U to (2,2), no food, positions become head (2,2), body (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) tail.\n\nHead direction: moved up, so U.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (5,6), which is a wall, cannot move there.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should eat food, but avoid risks.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible paths or options.\n\nSince I need to output actions for turn 7 and beyond, I should start with turn 7.\n\nBut for turn 7, I have two choices: L or U.\n\nIf I choose L, I eat (1,1) immediately, gain +1, length 5.\n\nIf I choose U, I move to tail, no gain, length still 4.\n\nBut moving U might be safer or lead to other opportunities?\n\nLet's see the grid.\n\nGrid: let's sketch for y from 0 to 7, x from 0 to 7.\n\ny=0 and y=7 walls, x=0 and x=7 walls.\n\nInternal wall at (5,6).\n\nFood: (1,1), (1,6), (3,5)\n\nSnake: head (2,1), body (3,1), (3,2), (2,2)\n\nAfter U move to (2,2), head at (2,2), body (2,1), (3,1), (3,2)\n\nNow, from (2,2), possible moves: last direction U, so cannot move D (opposite).\n\nAllowed: U, L, R? Directions: U, D, L, R.\n\nLast move U, so cannot D.\n\nCan U, L, R.\n\nU to (2,3)\n\nL to (1,2)\n\nR to (3,2) — but (3,2) is body! Current body positions after move: (2,1), (3,1), (3,2)\n\nSo (3,2) is the tail now? After U to (2,2), positions: head (2,2), then (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) tail.\n\nSo (3,2) is tail.\n\nR to (3,2): moving to tail, which is safe, as long as not food, which it isn't.\n\nSimilarly, U to (2,3) or L to (1,2).\n\n(1,2) might be empty or what? We don't know, but no food there, so empty.\n\nNow, compare to if I moved L first.\n\nI should think long-term.\n\nThe food at (1,1) has short life, only 4 turns, so if I don't eat it now, it might disappear soon. Since life span 4 at turn 7, present turns 7,8,9,10, gone turn 11. So I have until turn 10 to eat it.\n\nBut if I don't eat it now, I might not get another chance, depending on position.\n\nSimilarly, other food has longer life.\n\n(1,6) life 7, until turn 13, (3,5) life 10, until turn 16.\n\nNow, snake at (2,1), to reach (1,1) is easy, one move left.\n\nTo reach other food: (1,6) is at x=1,y=6, which is left top if y up.\n\n(3,5) at x=3,y=5.\n\nAlso, the tail is at (2,2), which is near.\n\nAnother thing: after eating, snake grows, so more body, might block paths.\n\nBut currently short, only 4 segments.\n\nTo maximize, I should eat the food when possible, but avoid dead ends.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving L on turn 7 to eat (1,1).\n\nTurn 7: move L to (1,1), eat food, grow to length 5.\n\nNew positions: head (1,1), body (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) tail.\n\nHead direction L.\n\nNow turn 8: from (1,1), last move L, so cannot move R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (1,2), D to (1,0) but y=0 wall, invalid, L to (0,1) but x=0 wall, invalid, R not allowed.\n\nSo only U to (1,2) possible? U to (1,2), which should be empty.\n\n(1,2) not occupied, no food, so move there.\n\nThen head to (1,2), no food, so snake moves: head (1,2), then (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) tail. (2,2) is gone? Positions: after eating at (1,1), snake: [(1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2)]\n\nWhen move without eating, head to new position, tail removed.\n\nSo from (1,1) move U to (1,2), no food, so new head (1,2), then body: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) tail. (2,2) is removed.\n\nYes.\n\nNow head at (1,2), last move U.\n\nTurn 9: from (1,2), possible moves: U to (1,3), D to (1,1) but (1,1) is now body, occupied, cannot move there, collision.\n\nL to (0,2) wall, invalid.\n\nR to (2,2) — (2,2) is now empty? After move, (2,2) was removed, so (2,2) is empty.\n\nIn positions, after turn 8, snake: head (1,2), body (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) tail.\n\nSo cells occupied: (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2)\n\n(2,2) is free.\n\nR to (2,2) is possible, since empty.\n\nAlso U to (1,3) possible.\n\nD to (1,1) is body, invalid.\n\nL to (0,2) wall.\n\nSo possible: U or R.\n\nNow, if U to (1,3), or R to (2,2).\n\n(2,2) is empty, no food.\n\nU to (1,3) empty.\n\nI need to go towards other food.\n\nFood at (1,6) or (3,5).\n\n(1,6) is at y=6, x=1, so from (1,2), moving up might be good.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) at x=3,y=5.\n\nBut snake body is around (1,1) to (3,2), so (1,6) is far.\n\nTurn 9: from (1,2), I can move U to (1,3) or R to (2,2).\n\nIf I move U to (1,3), then head (1,3), last move U.\n\nThen turn 10: from (1,3), possible U to (1,4), D to (1,2) body, L wall, R to (2,3) if empty.\n\n(2,3) should be empty.\n\nSo U or R.\n\nContinue U to (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) to eat food at (1,6).\n\nFrom (1,3) to (1,4) to (1,5) to (1,6).\n\nBut (1,6) has food, life span 7, present until turn 13.\n\nTurn 7: ate (1,1), turn 8: to (1,2), turn 9: to (1,3), turn 10: to (1,4), turn 11: to (1,5), turn 12: to (1,6) eat.\n\nBut turn 12, food (1,6) still present? Life span 7 at turn 7, so turns 7,8,9,10,11,12,13, gone turn 14. So turn 12 is within, can eat.\n\nSimilarly, if I go directly up.\n\nBut on the way, I might have options.\n\nBack to turn 9, if I move R to (2,2) instead.\n\nFrom (1,2) move R to (2,2), no food, head to (2,2), body (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1) tail? Positions: after move, head (2,2), body (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1) tail. (3,2) gone.\n\nLast move R.\n\nThen from (2,2), turn 10: possible moves U to (2,3), D to (2,1) body, L to (1,2) body, R to (3,2) — (3,2) is empty now? Yes, since not occupied.\n\nSo U or R.\n\nU to (2,3), or R to (3,2).\n\nThen I can go towards (3,5) or something.\n\nBut let's see the other choice at turn 7.\n\nIf at turn 7 I move U instead of L.\n\nTurn 7: move U to (2,2), tail position, no food, no grow.\n\nNew positions: head (2,2), body (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) tail.\n\nLast move U.\n\nTurn 8: from (2,2), last move U, so cannot D.\n\nPossible: U to (2,3), L to (1,2), R to (3,2) — (3,2) is tail, so safe to move there.\n\nNow, if I move L to (1,2), or U to (2,3), or R to (3,2).\n\n(1,2) is empty, no food.\n\nIf I move L to (1,2), head to (1,2), no food, positions: head (1,2), body (2,2), (2,1), (3,1) tail. (3,2) gone.\n\nLast move L.\n\nThen from (1,2), turn 9: possible U to (1,3), D to (1,1), L to (0,2) wall, R to (2,2) body (since (2,2) is body now).\n\nD to (1,1): (1,1) has food! And it's not body? Current positions: head (1,2), body (2,2), (2,1), (3,1) tail.\n\n(1,1) is not occupied, and has food with life span 4, still present? Turn 8, life span was 4 at turn 7, so after turn 7, countdown 3, turn 8 countdown 2, so still present.\n\nAt turn 8, from (1,2), I can move D to (1,1) to eat the food.\n\nD to (1,1) is down, and last move was L (left), so no issue with direction.\n\nMove D to (1,1), eat food, grow to length 5.\n\nNew positions: head (1,1), body (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1) tail.\n\nThen continue.\n\nCompared to moving L directly at turn 7, here I ate the food at turn 8, one turn later, but same effect, length increased.\n\nIn this case, by moving U first then D, I ate the food later.\n\nBut in terms of score, same, I ate it.\n\nNow, if at turn 8 from (2,2) I move to (1,2) and then D to (1,1), I eat it.\n\nI could have other moves.\n\nBut back to the food at (1,1), if I don't eat it soon, it disappears after turn 10.\n\nIn the first scenario, if I move L at turn 7, I eat immediately.\n\nIf I move U at turn 7, then I can still eat it later, like at turn 8 or 9.\n\nBut at turn 8 from (2,2), if I don't move to (1,2), I might miss it.\n\nFor example, if I move U or R at turn 8, I might not get to (1,1) in time.\n\nSince (1,1) is only accessible from (1,2) or (2,1), but (2,1) might be body.\n\nIn the state after moving U to (2,2), positions: head (2,2), body (2,1), (3,1), (3,2)\n\n(2,1) is body, so from (2,2), I can only reach (1,1) via (1,2) or directly? Adjacent cells to (1,1): (1,2), (1,0) wall, (0,1) wall, (2,1).\n\n(2,1) is occupied by body, so only (1,2) is the access point.\n\nAnd (1,2) can be reached from (2,2) by moving left.\n\nSo at turn 8, if I move L to (1,2), then at turn 9 I can move D to (1,1) to eat.\n\nIf I move elsewhere, I might not get back in time.\n\nTurn 8: from (2,2), if I move U to (2,3), then I'm going away, and to reach (1,1) I need to go to (2,2) or something, but it might be occupied later.\n\nFor example, from (2,3), I can move to (1,3) or (2,4), etc., but to get to (1,1), I need to go down to (1,2) then to (1,1), but at turn 9, from (2,3) move to (1,3) or (2,4) or (2,2), but (2,2) might be body or not.\n\nIt's messy, and the food disappears after turn 10, so by turn 10 I need to be on (1,1).\n\nIf I don't go towards it, I might miss it.\n\nSince it's valuable, and I can eat it safely, I should eat it as soon as possible to not risk missing it.\n\nSimilarly, the other food.\n\nBut let's see the position of (1,1): it's at corner, and with walls, it might be a trap if I go there.\n\nAfter eating (1,1), I am at (1,1) or nearby, and I need to get out.\n\nFor example, after eating at (1,1), at turn 8 I moved to (1,2), then from there I can go up or right.\n\nGoing up, I can reach (1,6) directly.\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), so along y=1, but y=1 from x=1 to x=1, but I can go up the column.\n\nx=1, y from 1 to 6.\n\nBut at (1,1), I can only move up to (1,2), then (1,3), etc., to (1,6).\n\nNo obstacles, and walls on sides, so it's a corridor.\n\nSimilarly, from there, after eating (1,6), I can go to other places.\n\nBut there is also food at (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is at x=3,y=5.\n\nFrom the left column, I need to move right to reach it.\n\nBut with internal obstacle at (5,6), but (3,5) is fine.\n\nNow, another option: if I don't eat (1,1) and go for other food.\n\nBut (1,1) is easy to eat, and will disappear soon, so it's better to eat it.\n\nMoreover, not eating it means losing a point.\n\nSo I think eating (1,1) is good.\n\nNow, at turn 7, moving L to eat it directly.\n\nBut let's confirm the tail reward danger.\n\nHead at (2,1), tail at (2,2), adjacent, but food at (1,1), not on tail, so no issue.\n\nIf I move U to (2,2), no food, but I can still eat (1,1) later, as above.\n\nBut why delay? I gain nothing, and risk missing it if I change path.\n\nSo moving L at turn 7 seems better.\n\nThen, after that, I need to plan to eat other food.\n\nSo let's assume turn 7: move L to (1,1), eat, grow to length 5.\n\nPositions: head (1,1), body: (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) tail.\n\nHead direction L.\n\nTurn 8: from (1,1), only possible move U to (1,2), as D and L walls, R not allowed (last move L, opposite is R, cannot move R).\n\nLast move was L to (1,1), so direction L, cannot move R.\n\nU to (1,2) only choice.\n\nMove U to (1,2), no food, so head to (1,2), body: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) tail. (2,2) removed.\n\nLast move U.\n\nTurn 9: from (1,2), possible moves: U to (1,3), or R to (2,2) (since (2,2) empty), D to (1,1) body, L wall.\n\nSo U or R.\n\nNow, I need to go to (1,6) or (3,5).\n\n(1,6) is directly up, (3,5) is to the right and up.\n\nIf I move U to (1,3), I can continue up to (1,6).\n\nIf I move R to (2,2), then I can go to (3,5).\n\nBut (1,6) has shorter life? Life span 7 at turn 7, so until turn 13, (3,5) life 10 until turn 16.\n\nBoth have time.\n\nBut (1,6) is closer if I go up directly.\n\nFrom (1,2) to (1,6) is 4 moves up: to (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6).\n\nCan be done by turn 12 or 13.\n\nSimilarly, to (3,5): from (1,2) to (3,5), need to move right and up.\n\nFor example, via (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), etc., longer path.\n\nBut I can eat both, but need to see the order.\n\nSince (1,6) disappears earlier, I should eat it first.\n\nTurn 13 is last chance for (1,6), (3,5) later.\n\nSo better to go for (1,6) first.\n\nAt turn 9, from (1,2), I should move U to (1,3) to start going up.\n\nThen turn 10: from (1,3), move U to (1,4) (D to (1,2) body, L wall, R to (2,3) possible, but U to (1,4) better for direct path.\n\nMove U to (1,4).\n\nLast move U.\n\nTurn 11: from (1,4), U to (1,5) or R to (2,4), but U to (1,5) for food path.\n\nMove U to (1,5).\n\nLast move U.\n\nTurn 12: from (1,5), U to (1,6) eat food.\n\nEat at (1,6), grow to length 6.\n\nNew positions: head (1,6), body (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) — after eating, head to (1,6), body includes previous segments.\n\nPrevious: before move, head at (1,5), body (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) tail? Let's track.\n\nAt turn 11: after move to (1,5), positions: head (1,5), body (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) tail? From turn 9 to (1,3), turn 10 to (1,4), turn 11 to (1,5).\n\nAt turn 9: from (1,2) move U to (1,3), no food, positions: head (1,3), body (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1) tail? Earlier: after turn 8, positions: head (1,2), body (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) tail? I think I lost track.\n\nStart over from after turn 7.\n\nTurn 7: move L to (1,1), eat, so positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2)] with head at (1,1), tail (2,2).\n\nTurn 8: move U to (1,2), no food, so head to (1,2), tail removed, so positions: head (1,2), then (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) tail. (2,2) removed.\n\nBody: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) tail.\n\nTurn 9: from (1,2), move U to (1,3), no food, head to (1,3), body: (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1) tail. (3,2) removed.\n\nLast move U.\n\nTurn 10: from (1,3), move U to (1,4), no food, head to (1,4), body: (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1) tail. (3,1) removed.\n\nTurn 11: from (1,4), move U to (1,5), no food, head to (1,5), body: (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) tail? Body: (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), and (1,1) is still there? (1,1) was body, and (2,1) was tail removed.\n\nAt turn 10: positions head (1,4), body (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1) tail? No.\n\nAt turn 10 after move to (1,4): head (1,4), then (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), and tail (2,1)? Let's list:\n\nAfter turn 9: positions: head (1,3), body (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1) tail? At turn 9: after move to (1,3), head (1,3), body: the previous segments except tail removed, but tail is removed only if no eat.\n\nFrom turn 8: positions [(1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2)] with (3,2) tail.\n\nMove to (1,3): head to (1,3), no eat, so new head (1,3), and the tail (3,2) is removed, so body becomes: (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1) — and (3,1) is now the new tail.\n\nPositions: head (1,3), then (1,2), then (1,1), then (2,1), then (3,1) tail.\n\n(3,2) was removed.\n\nTurn 10: move U to (1,4), no food, head to (1,4), body: (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1) tail. (3,1) removed.\n\nTurn 11: move U to (1,5), no food, head to (1,5), body: (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) tail. (2,1) removed.\n\nBody: (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) tail.\n\n(1,1) is tail.\n\nTurn 12: from (1,5), move U to (1,6), which has food, so eat, grow.\n\nHead to (1,6), new segment, so positions: head (1,6), then (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) — tail (1,1).\n\nLength 6.\n\nNow, last move U.\n\nFrom here, I can consider going to (3,5).\n\nBut (3,5) is at (3,5), and snake is all at x=1, y from 1 to 6.\n\nHead at (1,6).\n\nPossible moves: last move U, so cannot D.\n\nU to (1,7) but y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nD to (1,5) body, invalid.\n\nL to (0,6) wall, invalid.\n\nR to (2,6) possible, since empty.\n\nOnly R to (2,6).\n\nMove R to (2,6), no food, head to (2,6), body: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) tail? After move, tail removed? No eat, so head (2,6), body (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) tail. (1,1) removed.\n\nLast move R.\n\nNow turn 13: from (2,6), possible moves: U to (2,7) wall, D to (2,5), L to (1,6) body, R to (3,6).\n\nSo D or R.\n\nD to (2,5) or R to (3,6).\n\n(3,6) might be near obstacle, but (5,6) is wall, (3,6) should be fine.\n\nFood at (3,5), which is below.\n\n(3,5) at y=5, x=3.\n\nFrom (2,6), I can move D to (2,5), then to (3,5) or something.\n\nMove D to (2,5), no food.\n\nHead to (2,5), body: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) tail? Positions: after move to (2,5), head (2,5), body (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) tail. (1,2) removed.\n\nLast move D.\n\nThen turn 14: from (2,5), possible U to (2,6) body, D to (2,4), L to (1,5) body, R to (3,5) which has food! (3,5) has food.\n\nR to (3,5), eat it.\n\nSince life span 10, at turn 14, it should be present? Turn 7 life span 10, so turns 7 to 16, turn 14 is within.\n\nEat at (3,5), grow to length 7.\n\nGood.\n\nIf at turn 13 from (2,6) I moved R to (3,6), then from there I can move D to (3,5) to eat.\n\nSimilar.\n\nNow, but I have the internal obstacle at (5,6), but not in the way here.\n\nNow, back to turn 7, if I had chosen to move U instead.\n\nBut I think moving L is fine.\n\nIn the beginning, when I move U at turn 7, I might have other options.\n\nFor example, if turn 7 move U to (2,2), no eat.\n\nThen turn 8, I can move to (1,2) then turn 9 to (1,1) eat, as before.\n\nOr from (2,2) move R to (3,2) tail, no eat.\n\nThen positions: head (3,2), body (2,2), (2,1), (3,1) tail? After move to (3,2), head (3,2), body (2,2), (2,1), (3,1) tail.\n\nLast move R.\n\nThen from (3,2), I can go towards (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is at same x, y=5.\n\nMove U to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut I might miss (1,1) food.\n\nFor example, at turn 8, if I move R to (3,2), then from there, to reach (1,1) I need to go left, but (2,1) and (2,2) might be occupied or not.\n\nAt turn 8 after move to (3,2): positions head (3,2), body (2,2), (2,1), (3,1) tail.\n\n(1,1) is still there, but to access, I need to be at (1,2) or (2,1), but (2,1) is body, occupied, so only (1,2) is free, but from current position, I can move to (3,3) or (4,2) or (3,1) but (3,1) is tail, can move there, or D to (3,1) tail.\n\nMove to (3,1) is possible, safe.\n\nBut (3,1) is tail, no food.\n\nThen from there, I can move L to (2,1) but (2,1) is body, invalid.\n\nOnly moves from (3,2): U to (3,3), D to (3,1) tail, L to (2,2) body, R to (4,2).\n\nSo U, D, or R.\n\nIf D to (3,1), head to (3,1), body (3,2), (2,2), (2,1) tail? After move, head (3,1), body (3,2), (2,2), (2,1) tail. (3,1) was tail, now head.\n\nThen from (3,1), possible moves: U to (3,2) body, D to (3,0) wall, L to (2,1) body, R to (4,1).\n\nSo only R to (4,1).\n\nMove R to (4,1), and so on.\n\nI am moving away from (1,1), and it will disappear soon.\n\nBy turn 10, I cannot reach (1,1) anymore, since from (4,1) or wherever, it takes multiple moves, and (1,1) gone after turn 10.\n\nSo I miss the food at (1,1).\n\nThus, it's better to eat it early.\n\nTherefore, at turn 7, moving L to eat (1,1) is the best choice.\n\nThen proceed as above to eat (1,6) and then (3,5).\n\nIn the sequence, I have actions for turns.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output actions starting from turn 7.\n\nSo for turn 7: move L\n\nThen turn 8: move U\n\nTurn 9: move U\n\nTurn 10: move U\n\nTurn 11: move U\n\nTurn 12: move U to eat (1,6)\n\nBut turn 12 is beyond, but I can output for a few turns.\n\nSince it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but output for immediate turns.\n\nIn the plan, after turn 7, I have moves.\n\nBut at turn 9, I had a choice: from (1,2), I could move R or U, but I chose U to go to (1,6).\n\nIf I move R, I might go to (3,5) first, but (1,6) disappears earlier, so better to go to (1,6) first.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence above, it works.\n\nNow, about the internal obstacle at (5,6), it doesn't affect this path.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger not an issue here.\n\nSo I think the actions are:\n\nTurn 7: L\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nThen turn 12: U to eat (1,6), but I don't need to output turn 12, or should I?\n\nThe answer format says to list actions starting from turn t1, but number of turns not specified. Probably for the next few, or until a point.\n\nSince it says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" I can output for, say, 5 turns: turns 7 to 11.\n\nBut at turn 11, I move U to (1,5), then turn 12 U to (1,6).\n\nBut for the output, I can do up to turn 11 or 12.\n\nSince thinking ahead, output for 5 turns: turn 7 to 11.\n\nIn turn 11, I am at (1,5), heading to (1,6).\n\nIn the sequence, all moves are determined until I reach the food.\n\nAt turn 9, from (1,2), I must move U to continue to (1,6), no choice really, since moving R would delay or miss (1,6).\n\nIf I move R at turn 9 to (2,2), then from there, I need to go to (1,6) or (3,5).\n\nBut (1,6) is at (1,6), from (2,2) I need to go to (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6) or something, but (2,6) to (1,6) is left.\n\nBut it takes more turns, and (1,6) might be missed if I delay.\n\nFor example, from (1,2) at turn 9, if move R to (2,2), then turn 10 from (2,2) can move U to (2,3), turn 11 to (2,4), turn 12 to (2,5), turn 13 to (2,6), then turn 14 to (1,6)? But turn 14, food (1,6) is gone, since life span 7, last at turn 13.\n\nTurn 13 is last, so at turn 13 I need to be on (1,6).\n\nIf at turn 13 I move to (1,6), but from (2,6), I can move L to (1,6) at turn 13.\n\nBut let's see: if turn 9: from (1,2) move R to (2,2)\n\nThen positions: head (2,2), body (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1) tail? After move, head (2,2), body (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1) tail. (3,2) gone? Earlier state.\n\nAfter turn 8: head (1,2), body (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) tail.\n\nMove R to (2,2): head to (2,2), no eat, so new head (2,2), body (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1) tail. (3,2) removed.\n\nLast move R.\n\nTurn 10: from (2,2), possible U to (2,3), D to (2,1) body, L to (1,2) body, R to (3,2) empty.\n\nSo U or R.\n\nIf U to (2,3), head to (2,3), body (2,2), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1) tail. (3,1) removed.\n\nLast move U.\n\nTurn 11: from (2,3), U to (2,4), D to (2,2) body, L to (1,3), R to (3,3).\n\nSo U, L, or R.\n\nTo go to (1,6), I need to go up, say U to (2,4), then U to (2,5), U to (2,6), then L to (1,6) at turn 13 or 14.\n\nTurn 11: move U to (2,4)\n\nTurn 12: move U to (2,5)\n\nTurn 13: move U to (2,6)\n\nThen from (2,6), move L to (1,6) to eat, but at turn 14? Turn 13 move to (2,6), but food (1,6) must be eaten by turn 13.\n\nAt turn 13, I am at (2,6), and I can move L to (1,6) to eat it on turn 13.\n\nYes, possible.\n\nSimilarly, if I go directly, I eat at turn 12.\n\nBut by going via (2,2), I eat at turn 13, same score, but later.\n\nNo difference, except that in the direct path, I am confined to x=1, which might be riskier if there are threats, but here no.\n\nBut in this case, going directly up is shorter and safer.\n\nMoreover, after eating (1,6), I can go to (3,5) as before.\n\nBut in the direct path, after eating (1,6), I move right to (2,6), then down to (2,5), then right to (3,5) to eat around turn 14.\n\nIf I went via (2,2) and up, I might be at (2,6) at turn 13, eat (1,6), then similar.\n\nBut the direct path is fine.\n\nNow, back to the initial move, I think moving L at turn 7 is best.\n\nThen actions:\n\nTurn 7: L\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nThen for turn 9, from (1,2), I can move U to go directly to (1,6), or R to go to (3,5) first, but (3,5) has longer life, so better to eat (1,6) first.\n\nSo move U at turn 9.\n\nSimilarly, turn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nThen turn 12: U to eat (1,6), but since output might not include, or I can output up to turn 11.\n\nBut for the answer, I think output for turns 7,8,9,10,11.\n\nAt turn 11, I move U to (1,5), then turn 12 U to (1,6).\n\nBut for the sequence, it's consistent.\n\nPerhaps I can output fewer, but I think 5 turns is reasonable.\n\nSince head direction matters for no reverse.\n\nIn the sequence: after turn 7 move L, head direction L.\n\nTurn 8 move U, so direction U.\n\nTurn 9 move U, direction U.\n\nTurn 10 move U, direction U.\n\nTurn 11 move U, direction U.\n\nAll fine.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut in the state, there is also food at (1,6) and (3,5), which I plan to eat later.\n\nBut for now, actions from turn 7.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (5,6) is not in the way.\n\nSo I think it's good.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score while ensuring long-term survival, the plan prioritizes eating the positive food at (1,1) immediately due to its short remaining life span (disappears after turn 10). After consuming (1,1), the snake moves upward along the x=1 column to reach and eat the food at (1,6) before it disappears (life span 7, disappears after turn 13). The food at (3,5) has a longer life span (disappears after turn 16) and will be targeted after (1,6) is consumed. This sequence avoids risks such as collisions and dead ends, leveraging the safe path along the left wall.\n\n### Key Considerations for the Plan:\n- **Turn 7 Action**: Move left (L) to (1,1) to eat the food (+1 score, length increases to 5). This is safe as the head is not adjacent to the tail with food (tail at (2,2) has no food). Missing this food risks losing a point, as it disappears soon.\n- **Subsequent Actions**: After eating (1,1), the snake is confined to the x=1 column due to walls at x=0 and body positions. Moving up (U) repeatedly is the only safe and efficient path to (1,6).\n- **Life Span Management**: \n  - (1,1) must be eaten by turn 10; eating at turn 7 ensures it is not missed.\n  - (1,6) must be eaten by turn 13; moving directly up allows consumption at turn 12.\n  - (3,5) can be eaten later (by turn 16) and is not urgent.\n- **Collision Avoidance**: \n  - Moving into the tail (e.g., at turn 7 option to move U to (2,2)) is safe but delays eating (1,1), risking loss.\n  - No wall or body collisions occur in the planned path.\n- **5+ Turn Lookahead**: \n  - After eating (1,6) at turn 12, the snake can move right to (2,6) and then down to (3,5) to eat the remaining food, avoiding the internal obstacle at (5,6).\n  - This plan scores +2 (from (1,1) and (1,6)) within 6 turns, with a path to +3 from (3,5).\n\n### Planned Actions (Turns 7 to 11):\n- **Turn 7 (current)**: Move L to (1,1) to eat food. Head direction becomes L.\n- **Turn 8**: Move U to (1,2). Only possible move (down and left are walls/invalid; right is opposite direction and disallowed).

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 8, and I'm the snake AI. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nSnake positions: head at (1,1), then body segments at (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2). So the snake is in a sort of loop or bend. Let me plot this:\n\n- Head: (1,1)\n- Segment 2: (2,1)\n- Segment 3: (3,1)\n- Segment 4: (3,2)\n- Segment 5: (2,2)\n\nAnd the head direction is left, meaning it was moving left to reach (1,1). Since head is at (1,1) and direction is L, it came from the right, so from (2,1) to (1,1).\n\nNow, food:\n\n- First food: (1,6) with life span 6 and value +1. Life span 6 means it disappears after 6 turns, including current turn, so it has 6 turns left starting from now? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 8, life span 6 means it will disappear after turn 13? Let me calculate.\n\nLife span N: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So if life span is 6 at turn 8, it decreases to 5 at turn 9, to 4 at turn 10, ..., to 0 at turn 13? Turn 8: life span 6, turn 9:5, turn10:4, turn11:3, turn12:2, turn13:1, turn14:0 and disappears? But it says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nI think I need to clarify. If at turn t, a food has life span L, then at turn t, L decreases to L-1? No, let's read carefully.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo, for a food with life span N at turn t, it will disappear after N more turns. Meaning, it will be present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+N-1, and disappear at turn t+N.\n\nCountdown decreases every turn, so at turn t, countdown is N; at turn t+1, countdown is N-1; ... at turn t+N-1, countdown is 1; at turn t+N, countdown 0, disappears.\n\nBut the value is given with life span, so at turn 8, food at (1,6) has life span 6, so countdown starts at 6, decreases each turn, disappears after 6 turns, so last turn it exists is turn 13 (since 8+5=13? Let's count: turns 8,9,10,11,12,13 — that's 6 turns, disappears at turn 14.\n\n- Turn 8: present, countdown 6\n- Turn 9: present, countdown 5\n- Turn 10: present, countdown 4\n- Turn 11: present, countdown 3\n- Turn 12: present, countdown 2\n- Turn 13: present, countdown 1\n- Turn 14: disappears\n\nSimilarly, second food at (3,5) with life span 9, value +1.\n\nBoth foods are positive, value +1.\n\nNow, head direction is L, so current direction is left. That means I cannot move right on the next turn because of no instant reverse. So possible moves from (1,1) are up, down, left? But let's see the grid.\n\nGrid is 8x8, walls at borders, so x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nSnake head at (1,1). Possible moves:\n\n- Up (U): (x,y+1) = (1,2)\n\n- Down (D): (x,y-1) = (1,0) but y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n\n- Left (L): (x-1,y) = (0,1) but x=0 is wall, so invalid.\n\n- Right (R): (x+1,y) = (2,1) but (2,1) is occupied by the second segment of the snake.\n\n(2,1) is a body segment, but it's not the tail; the tail is at (2,2).\n\nBody collision: head touches any body segment except the tail, because when moving, the tail moves, so it's safe to move to the tail position only if the tail is moving away.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, moving to a cell that will be vacated by the tail is safe, but moving to a body segment that is not the tail causes collision.\n\nIn this case, from (1,1), moving right to (2,1): (2,1) is occupied by segment 2, which is not the tail. The tail is at (2,2), so (2,1) is a body segment, so moving there would cause collision.\n\nSimilarly, moving left to (0,1) is wall, invalid.\n\nMoving down to (1,0) is wall, invalid.\n\nMoving up to (1,2): is (1,2) occupied? Snake positions are (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2). So (1,2) is not listed, so it should be empty.\n\n(1,2) is not a wall or obstacle? Walls are borders and (5,6), so (1,2) should be free.\n\nBut let's confirm: cells occupied: snake and walls.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (5,6).\n\nSo (1,2): x=1 between 0 and 7, y=2 between 0 and 7, not (5,6), so free.\n\nTherefore, from (1,1), only possible move is up to (1,2), because:\n\n- Left: (0,1) wall\n\n- Right: (2,1) body segment (not tail)\n\n- Down: (1,0) wall\n\n- Up: (1,2) free\n\nIs that right? Head direction is L, but since only one move possible, no choice.\n\nBut let's think about the tail: tail is at (2,2). If I move up to (1,2), what happens?\n\nAfter move: head moves to (1,2), then the body follows: the segment behind head was at (2,1), which moves to (1,1)? Let's see the positions.\n\nCurrent positions: [(1,1) head, (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2) tail]\n\nAfter moving head to (1,2): new head position (1,2), then the body segments shift: the first body segment (2,1) moves to where head was, (1,1)? No.\n\nWhen snake moves, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo:\n\n- New head: (1,2)\n\n- Segment that was at (2,1) moves to (1,1)\n\n- Segment that was at (3,1) moves to (2,1)\n\n- Segment that was at (3,2) moves to (3,1)\n\n- Segment that was at (2,2) moves to (3,2)\n\nThe tail was at (2,2), and it moves to (3,2), so the new tail is at (3,2).\n\nNow, (1,2) is free, so no collision.\n\nAlso, no food at (1,2), so no eating.\n\nBut in this move, I didn't eat, so length unchanged.\n\nNow, the problem is to think 5+ turns ahead and maximize score.\n\nBut at turn 8, I have to make a move, and since only one possible move, I must go up to (1,2).\n\nBut let's confirm if I can move other directions.\n\nHead at (1,1), direction L, meaning last move was left to (1,1), so from (2,1) to (1,1).\n\nPossible moves: since direction is L, I cannot move right (opposite) immediately, but in this case, right is to (2,1) which is body, so invalid anyway.\n\nDown to (1,0) wall.\n\nLeft to (0,1) wall.\n\nUp to (1,2) free.\n\nSo only U is possible.\n\nTherefore, for turn 8, action must be U.\n\nNow, the answer should be for multiple turns, but I need to plan ahead.\n\nThe instruction says to think 5+ turns ahead and output actions for the next few turns, but the answer format is for turns starting from t1.\n\n\"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action ... Turn t1+1: action ... etc. }\"\n\nAnd it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so I need to output a sequence of actions for several turns, but since the state changes, I should plan a sequence based on current state.\n\nBut food life span and positions might change, and I need to consider future moves.\n\nAlso, there are foods to eat.\n\nFirst, let's list the grid for clarity.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal at (5,6).\n\nSo free cells except walls and snake.\n\nSnake: positions: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2)\n\nAfter move to (1,2), new positions: head (1,2), then (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) — tail at (3,2).\n\n(2,2) was tail, but it moved to (3,2), so segments: (1,2) head, then (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) tail.\n\nNow, head at (1,2), direction was L, but after moving up, new direction is U.\n\nNow, possible moves from (1,2):\n\n- U: (1,3)\n\n- D: (1,1) but (1,1) is now the second segment, which is body, not tail. The tail is at (3,2), so (1,1) is body segment, moving there would cause collision.\n\n- L: (0,2) x=0 wall, invalid\n\n- R: (2,2) — is (2,2) occupied? Currently, after move, positions are (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2). So (2,2) is empty? Yes, not occupied.\n\n(2,2) was previously occupied, but after move, it's free.\n\nIn the new positions: (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2). So (2,2) is free.\n\nAlso, no wall, so moving right to (2,2) is possible.\n\nSimilarly, up to (1,3) free, I assume.\n\nDown to (1,1) is body, invalid.\n\nLeft invalid.\n\nSo from (1,2), possible moves: U or R.\n\nDirection is now U, since I moved up.\n\nNow, foods: (1,6) with life span 6 at turn 8, so it will last until turn 13.\n\n(3,5) with life span 9, until turn 16 (turn 8+8=16? Life span 9 at turn 8: disappears after 9 turns, so last at turn 16, disappears turn 17.\n\nTurn 8: life 9, turn 9:8, ..., turn 16:1, turn 17:0 disappear.\n\nSimilarly for (1,6): life 6 at turn 8, turn 13:1, turn 14:0 disappear.\n\nNow, I need to think about eating food.\n\nBut (1,6) is at (1,6), which is far from current position (1,2). I can move up to get closer.\n\n(3,5) is at (3,5), which is also not close; current head (1,2), so (3,5) is 2 right, 3 up.\n\nBut there is an obstacle at (5,6), but not blocking directly.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid risks.\n\nFirst, at turn 8, I must move U to (1,2).\n\nThen at turn 9, from (1,2), I can move U or R.\n\nIf I move U to (1,3), or R to (2,2).\n\nNow, let's think about the food at (1,6). To reach it, I need to go up along x=1, but y from 2 to 6.\n\ny=3,4,5,6.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any issues.\n\nAlso, the tail is at (3,2), but it will move.\n\nMoreover, there is a danger with tail and food, but only if food is on tail and head adjacent.\n\nCurrently no food on tail.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I should eat both foods if possible.\n\n(1,6) has shorter life, only 6 turns left, so I should prioritize it if I can reach in time.\n\nFrom (1,2) to (1,6): need to move up 4 times, so from turn 9 to turn 12 I can reach, if I go directly up.\n\nTurn 8: move to (1,2) — not eating.\n\nTurn 9: if move U to (1,3)\n\nTurn 10: U to (1,4)\n\nTurn 11: U to (1,5)\n\nTurn 12: U to (1,6) — and eat, since food is there.\n\nLife span of (1,6) at turn 8 is 6, so at turn 9:5, turn10:4, turn11:3, turn12:2, so at turn 12, it is still there, countdown 2? Turn 12: countdown should be 6 - (12-8) = 6-4=2? Let's keep track.\n\nAt turn 8, life span 6, so after turn 8, countdown 5 for turn 9? Better to think per turn.\n\nDefine: at the start of turn t, before action, the state is given.\n\nAt turn 8, food has life span 6, meaning it can be eaten during turns 8 to 13 inclusive? As I thought earlier.\n\nTurn 8: present, life span 6\n\nAfter turn 8 action, if not eaten, life span decreases to 5 for turn 9.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo for (1,6):\n\n- Available until turn 13 (since disappears after 6 turns from turn 8, so after turn 13, gone at turn 14).\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) until turn 16 (life span 9 from turn 8, so after turn 16, gone at turn 17).\n\nNow, from (1,2) at turn 9 (after turn 8 move), I can reach (1,6) by turn 12: turn 9 to (1,3), turn10 (1,4), turn11 (1,5), turn12 (1,6) eat.\n\nAt turn 12, (1,6) has life span: at turn 8:6, turn9:5, turn10:4, turn11:3, turn12:2, so yes, present.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows, so new segment added, length increases.\n\nNow, what about the other move option at turn 9, moving right to (2,2).\n\nIf I go to (2,2) at turn 9, then I need to go to (1,6) which might take longer.\n\nFor example, from (2,2), I can go up to (2,3), then left to (1,3), etc., but more moves.\n\nBut (1,6) might expire, so better to go directly up if possible.\n\nBut is the path clear?\n\nFrom (1,2), if I go up repeatedly, cells (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) should be free.\n\nAre there any obstacles? Walls only at borders, internal (5,6) not affecting, and no snake body there currently.\n\nAfter moving, snake is at (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), so (1,3) to (1,6) free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4), (1,5) free.\n\n(1,6) has food.\n\nSo going up seems good.\n\nBut I need to consider the tail and potential collisions.\n\nAlso, after eating at (1,6) on turn 12, the snake grows, so the new tail is where the head was or something.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, at turn 8, only move is U to (1,2).\n\nThen at turn 9, I can choose U or R.\n\nIf I go U, towards food.\n\nBut what about the other food at (3,5)? It has longer life, so I can get it later.\n\nBut let's see if I can get both.\n\nFirst, let's plan to get (1,6) quickly.\n\nSo at turn 9, move U to (1,3).\n\nThen turn 10, U to (1,4)\n\nTurn 11, U to (1,5)\n\nTurn 12, U to (1,6) and eat.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows: when head moves to food, it eats, so new segment added at the tail end, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n\nStandard snake: when eat food, head moves to food, new segment added where tail was or something? Rule doesn't specify, but from food mechanics: \"Length of snake +1\" when eat positive food.\n\nAnd \"the head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nThen, the body: normally, when not eating, all segments move, tail moves away.\n\nWhen eating, head moves to food, new segment is added, so the body doesn't move, meaning the segment before head stays, and new segment is added at the tail position or something.\n\nI think I need clarification.\n\nTypically in snake, when you eat, the head moves to the food, and a new segment is added at the position where the tail was, so the tail doesn't move, and the snake grows by one.\n\nWhen not eating, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to previous position, tail moves away.\n\nSimilarly here.\n\nFrom rule: \"Length of snake +1\" when eat positive food.\n\nAnd for movement, when eat, the tail doesn't move, new segment is added.\n\nOtherwise, tail moves.\n\nIn the state, when head moves to food, it eats, and length increases.\n\nNow, back to sequence.\n\nAt turn 8: move U to (1,2), no eat, so positions: head (1,2), body (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), tail (3,2)\n\nTurn 9: move U to (1,3), no food there, so positions: head (1,3), body (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), tail (3,1) — since tail moved from (3,2) to (3,1)? Let's trace:\n\n- Head moves to (1,3)\n\n- Segment that was at (1,2) moves to (1,2)? No: the segment behind head was at (1,1) — positions: before move: head (1,2), seg1 (1,1), seg2 (2,1), seg3 (3,1), tail (3,2)\n\nAfter move head to (1,3):\n\n- New head: (1,3)\n\n- Seg1 moves to (1,2) (previous head)\n\n- Seg2 moves to (1,1) (previous seg1)\n\n- Seg3 moves to (2,1) (previous seg2)\n\n- Tail moves to (3,1) (previous seg3)\n\n(3,2) was tail, but since not eating, tail moves to previous seg3 position, which was (3,1)? Seg3 was at (3,1), and it moves to (2,1)? List indices.\n\nLet positions be P0=head, P1, P2, P3, P4=tail.\n\nAt turn 9 start: P0=(1,2), P1=(1,1), P2=(2,1), P3=(3,1), P4=(3,2)\n\nAfter move to (1,3) without eating:\n\nNew P0 = (1,3)\n\nNew P1 = old P0 = (1,2)\n\nNew P2 = old P1 = (1,1)\n\nNew P3 = old P2 = (2,1)\n\nNew P4 = old P3 = (3,1)  // tail moves to old P3\n\nOld P4 (3,2) is vacated.\n\nSo positions: (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1)\n\nTail at (3,1)\n\nNow turn 10: move U to (1,4), no food, positions:\n\nHead (1,4), then (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1) tail at (2,1)\n\nTurn 11: move U to (1,5), no food? (1,5) has no food, food at (1,6) and (3,5), so (1,5) empty.\n\nPositions: head (1,5), body (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,1) tail? After move:\n\nBefore turn 11: positions (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1)\n\nMove head to (1,5):\n\nNew head (1,5)\n\nNew P1 = old P0 = (1,4)\n\nNew P2 = old P1 = (1,3)\n\nNew P3 = old P2 = (1,2)\n\nNew P4 = old P3 = (1,1)  // tail at (1,1)\n\n(2,1) vacated.\n\nTurn 12: move U to (1,6), which has food, so eat. Head moves to (1,6), food eaten, so new segment added. Since eating, the tail does not move; a new segment is added at the tail position.\n\nSo positions: head moves to (1,6)\n\nThe body segments do not move; new segment added at current tail position, so tail stays, and a new segment is there.\n\nSo after eating: head at (1,6), and the previous positions remain, with new tail added.\n\nBefore move: positions (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) tail at (1,1)\n\nHead moves to (1,6), eat food, so:\n\nNew head: (1,6)\n\nThe body segments stay in place: so (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) remain, but since new segment added, the tail is extended.\n\nSpecifically: the segment that was at (1,5) is no longer head, but since not moving, it stays as body.\n\nAfter eating: the head is at new position (1,6), and all previous body segments remain, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position (1,1), so now snake has positions: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) — new tail at (1,1).\n\nLength increased from 5 to 6.\n\nNow, direction is U.\n\nNow, at this point, I have eaten one food.\n\nBut I need to think about the other food at (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is at (3,5), and current head at (1,6).\n\nI can go towards it.\n\nBut first, at turn 8, I must move U.\n\nThen for turn 9, if I move U, as above, I can eat at turn 12.\n\nBut at turn 9, I had option to move R instead.\n\nIf at turn 9, I move R to (2,2), what happens?\n\nAt turn 8 end: positions head (1,2), body (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), tail (3,2)\n\nTurn 9: move R to (2,2). (2,2) is free, no food, so move normally.\n\nNew head (2,2)\n\nThen new P1 = old P0 = (1,2)\n\nNew P2 = old P1 = (1,1)\n\nNew P3 = old P2 = (2,1)\n\nNew P4 = old P3 = (3,1) // tail at (3,1)\n\nOld tail (3,2) vacated.\n\nPositions: (2,2), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1)\n\nNow head at (2,2), direction R (since moved right).\n\nFrom here, to reach (1,6), I need to go up and left, but (1,6) might expire soon.\n\nFor example, from (2,2), I can go U to (2,3), then U to (2,4), etc., but to (1,6) I need to go left at some point, but x=1,y=6.\n\nFrom (2,2) to (1,6): need to go up 4 and left 1, but not necessarily straight.\n\nBut y from 2 to 6, up 4, x from 2 to 1, left 1.\n\nBut I need to be at (1,6) by turn 13 at latest.\n\nTurn 9: at (2,2)\n\nTurn 10: say U to (2,3)\n\nTurn 11: U to (2,4)\n\nTurn 12: U to (2,5)\n\nTurn 13: L to (1,5) or directly to (1,6) but (1,6) from (2,5) is not adjacent, (2,5) to (1,6) is diagonal, not possible, must move orthogonally.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can move L to (1,5) or U to (2,6) or D to (2,4) etc.\n\nThen from (1,5) to (1,6) U.\n\nBut (1,6) must be reached by turn 13.\n\nAt turn 13, if I go to (1,6), life span: at turn 13, countdown should be 1 (since turn 8:6, turn9:5, ..., turn13:1), so yes, can eat on turn 13.\n\nBut if I go via (2,2), I reach (1,6) on turn 13, whereas if I go directly up from (1,2), I reach on turn 12, which is fine.\n\nBut in the direct up path, I eat earlier, which might be better, and I have more time for other things.\n\nMoreover, by going directly up, I stay close to the left side, which might be safer or something.\n\nBut let's see the other food.\n\n(3,5) has longer life, so I can get it after.\n\nBut in the sequence where I go up directly, after eating at (1,6) on turn 12, head at (1,6), positions (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1)\n\nNow, from (1,6), I can move to get (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is at (3,5), so I need to go right and down.\n\nPossible moves from (1,6): U, D, L, R.\n\nBut y=6, not wall, y=7 wall, so U to (1,7) invalid, y=7 wall.\n\nD to (1,5) but (1,5) is body segment, occupied, cannot move there.\n\nL to (0,6) x=0 wall, invalid.\n\nR to (2,6) which should be free.\n\n(2,6) not wall, not occupied, so only possible move is R to (2,6).\n\nBecause U and L invalid, D is body.\n\nSo after turn 12 eat, at turn 13, I must move R to (2,6).\n\nThen turn 14, from (2,6), possible moves: U to (2,7) y=7 wall invalid, D to (2,5), R to (3,6), L to (1,6) but (1,6) is body now? Positions after turn 13 move.\n\nAt turn 12 end: positions (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) tail at (1,1)\n\nTurn 13: move R to (2,6), no food there, so move normally: head to (2,6), then body shifts: P1 to (1,6), P2 to (1,5), P3 to (1,4), P4 to (1,3), P5 to (1,2), tail at (1,2)\n\nNew positions: head (2,6), body (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) tail at (1,2)\n\nNow from (2,6), moves: U invalid (wall), D to (2,5), R to (3,6), L to (1,6) but (1,6) is body segment, not tail, so collision if move there.\n\nTail is at (1,2), far away.\n\nSo cannot move L to (1,6).\n\nPossible: D to (2,5) or R to (3,6).\n\n(2,5) and (3,6) should be free.\n\nNow, (3,5) is at (3,5), so to reach it, from (2,6), I can go D to (2,5), then R to (3,5) to eat.\n\n(2,5) to (3,5) is R.\n\n(2,5) to (3,5) is adjacent? (2,5) and (3,5) differ in x by 1, y same, so yes, right move.\n\nSimilarly, from (2,6), if I go R to (3,6), then D to (3,5).\n\nBut (3,5) is food, so I can eat directly.\n\nNow, life span of (3,5): at turn 8, life 9, so turn 13: life span 9 - (13-8) = 9-5=4? Turn 13: countdown 4.\n\nAvailable until turn 16.\n\nSo I can eat on turn 14 or later.\n\nFrom (2,6) at turn 13 end.\n\nTurn 14: I can move D to (2,5) or R to (3,6).\n\nIf move D to (2,5), no food, then positions: head (2,5), body (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) tail at (1,3)\n\nThen turn 15: from (2,5), can move to (3,5) to eat, since (3,5) adjacent right.\n\nMove R to (3,5), eat, grow.\n\nIf at turn 14 I move R to (3,6), no food, then at (3,6), then turn 15 move D to (3,5) to eat.\n\nEither way, I can eat by turn 15.\n\nBut if I go directly to (3,5) via (2,5), I eat on turn 15, same as via (3,6).\n\n(2,5) to (3,5) is direct.\n\nNow, but there is an obstacle at (5,6), but not affecting here.\n\nIn this path, I ate both foods.\n\nBut earlier, at turn 9, if I had moved R instead of U, I might have a different situation.\n\nFor example, at turn 9 move R to (2,2), then I need to reach (1,6) by turn 13.\n\nAs I said, turn 10 U to (2,3), turn 11 U to (2,4), turn 12 U to (2,5), turn 13 L to (1,5) or to (1,6)? From (2,5) to (1,6) not adjacent, so must go to (1,5) first.\n\nTurn 13: from (2,5) move L to (1,5), no food, then turn 14 U to (1,6) to eat.\n\nBut at turn 14, (1,6) countdown: turn 8:6, turn14:6 - (14-8) =6-6=0? Countdown decreases each turn.\n\nAt turn 13, countdown for (1,6) is 6 - (13-8) =6-5=1, so at turn 13 it is present.\n\nAfter turn 13 action, if not eaten, countdown decreases to 0, disappears.\n\nSo on turn 13, if I move to (1,5), not eating (1,6), then at end of turn 13, (1,6) disappears, since countdown was 1 at turn 13 start, after decrease, 0.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nAt start of turn t, food has countdown C.\n\nAfter the move, if head moves to food, it eats, food consumed.\n\nIf not, and food not eaten, countdown decreases by 1 for next turn.\n\nIf countdown was 1, after decrease to 0, food disappears.\n\nFor (1,6) at turn 8: countdown 6\n\nTurn 9: countdown 5 (if not eaten on turn 8)\n\n...\n\nTurn 12: countdown 2\n\nTurn 13: countdown 1\n\nIf on turn 13, head moves to (1,6), it eats, food consumed.\n\nIf not, after turn 13, countdown decreases to 0, and food disappears, so not available on turn 14.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence where I go via (2,2):\n\nTurn 9: move R to (2,2)\n\nTurn 10: U to (2,3)\n\nTurn 11: U to (2,4)\n\nTurn 12: U to (2,5)  // now at (2,5)\n\nTurn 13: move L to (1,5)  // not (1,6), so no eat. (1,6) still there? At turn 13 start, countdown 1, so if I move to (1,5), not to (1,6), so (1,6) not eaten, and after turn 13, countdown decreases to 0, disappears.\n\nThen turn 14: I could move U to (1,6), but food gone, no eat.\n\nSo I miss (1,6) food.\n\nWhereas if on turn 13 from (2,5), I move directly to (1,6)? But (1,6) is at (1,6), (2,5) is not adjacent; adjacent cells share side, so (2,5) adjacent to (1,5), (2,4), (2,6), (3,5), not (1,6).\n\nSo I cannot move directly to (1,6) from (2,5). Must go through (1,5) or (2,6), etc.\n\nBut (1,5) is the only way to (1,6), but from (2,5) to (1,5) L, then to (1,6) U, but by turn 14, food gone.\n\nSo in this path, I cannot eat (1,6) if I go via (2,2) at turn 9.\n\nTherefore, to eat (1,6), I must go directly up from turn 9.\n\nThus, at turn 9, moving U is better.\n\nThen I can eat both as before.\n\nNow, back to the initial move.\n\nAt turn 8, only possible move is U to (1,2).\n\nThen at turn 9, from (1,2), I should move U to (1,3) to head towards (1,6).\n\nThen turn 10 U to (1,4), turn 11 U to (1,5), turn 12 U to (1,6) eat.\n\nNow, for turn 13, as before, from (1,6), only possible move is R to (2,6).\n\nThen turn 14, from (2,6), I can move D to (2,5) or R to (3,6).\n\nNow, to reach (3,5), I can go to (2,5) then to (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is at (3,5), so from (2,6), moving D to (2,5) is closer.\n\nThen from (2,5), I can move R to (3,5) to eat.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (3,6) first, then D to (3,5).\n\nBut (3,6) might be near the obstacle, but (5,6) is obstacle, (3,6) is fine.\n\nBut let's see if there is any risk.\n\nAlso, I need to think about tail and collisions.\n\nIn the sequence after eating (1,6), snake is at (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) — all on x=1, y=1 to 6.\n\nAfter turn 13 move R to (2,6), positions: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) tail at (1,2)\n\nNow turn 14: if I move D to (2,5), no food, positions: head (2,5), body (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) tail at (1,3)\n\nThen turn 15: move R to (3,5), which has food, so eat. Head to (3,5), eat, grow: new head (3,5), body segments stay: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) and new segment at tail position (1,3)? Before move, positions: head (2,5), P1 (2,6), P2 (1,6), P3 (1,5), P4 (1,4), P5 (1,3) tail\n\nAfter move to (3,5) with eat: head to (3,5), body segments do not move, new segment added at previous tail position, so positions: (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) and new segment at (1,3)? No.\n\nPrevious tail was at (1,3), new segment added there, so the segment that was tail is still there, and new one added.\n\nAfter eating, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the current tail position, so the tail doesn't move, and the new segment is the new tail.\n\nSo positions: new head (3,5), then the previous positions except the tail is extended.\n\nBefore move: segments: S0: (2,5), S1: (2,6), S2: (1,6), S3: (1,5), S4: (1,4), S5: (1,3)  // S5 tail\n\nMove head to (3,5), eat, so:\n\nNew head: (3,5)\n\nThe body segments S1 to S5 remain in place: so S1 at (2,6), S2 at (1,6), S3 at (1,5), S4 at (1,4), S5 at (1,3)\n\nAnd new segment added at S5 position (1,3), so now S5 and new S6 both at (1,3)? No, that can't be.\n\nI think I have confusion.\n\nStandard: when not eating, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to previous position, tail vacates.\n\nWhen eating, head moves to new cell (food), and a new segment is created at the position where the tail was, so the tail does not vacate; instead, it stays, and the new segment is attached, so the snake grows by one.\n\nThe body segments behind the head do not move; only the head moves to the new position.\n\nThen the new segment is added at the current tail position.\n\nSo the cell that was tail is now occupied by two segments? No.\n\nPositions: before eating, the snake occupies certain cells, including tail cell.\n\nAfter eating, head moves to food cell, which is new, and the body remains, and a new segment is added at the tail position, but since tail was already there, it becomes part of the body, and the new segment is the new tail.\n\nFor example, before move: positions A (head), B, C, D (tail)\n\nHead moves to E (food), eat, so new head E, body segments B, C, D remain, and new segment added at D, so now positions: E, B, C, D, and new F at D? But D is occupied.\n\nI think I have it wrong.\n\nBetter to think: the tail position does not change when eating; a new segment is added there, so the snake extends from the tail.\n\nBut the head moves to the new cell.\n\nSo the segment that was tail is still there, and a new segment is added behind it, but since it was tail, now it has a segment behind? No.\n\nIn terms of positions: suppose before move, cells: head at H, body at B1, B2, ..., tail at T.\n\nAfter move without eating: head to new_pos, B1 to H, B2 to B1, ..., tail to previous position of the second last, T vacated.\n\nWith eating: head to food cell, B1 to H? No, when eating, the body does not move; only the head moves to food, and a new segment is added at the tail position T, so the positions become: head at food, then H, B1, B2, ..., T, and new segment at T? But T is occupied.\n\nI think the correct way is: when eating, the head moves to the food cell, and the body segments stay where they are (so the neck becomes the new position, etc.), but the tail does not move, and a new segment is added at the tail, so the tail position has the new segment, and the old tail becomes part of the body.\n\nBut the positions: before move, the snake occupies cells, say for length L: C0, C1, C2, ..., C{L-1} with C0 head, C{L-1} tail.\n\nAfter move to new cell E with eating: new head at E, then the positions become E, C0, C1, C2, ..., C{L-1} and a new cell at C{L-1} for the new segment? But C{L-1} is already occupied.\n\nI think I need to look for standard implementation.\n\nPerhaps: when eating, the head moves to the food cell, and the body does not move, so the segment that was behind head stays, and a new segment is added at the tail position, but since the body doesn't move, the positions are: new head at food, then the old head position, then the rest body positions, and the tail position has the new segment added, so the new tail is at the old tail position.\n\nBut the old tail position is occupied by the old tail segment, so adding a new segment there means two segments at same cell? No.\n\nI think I have a mistake.\n\nUpon second thought, in most snake games, when you eat, the head moves to the food, and the tail does not move, so the snake grows by one cell at the tail end. So the new position is the food, and the tail remains, so the length increases.\n\nThe cells: before move, snake at positions P.\n\nAfter move with eat: head to new cell, the body segments remain in place, and the tail stays, so the new snake has the new head position, and all previous positions including tail.\n\nFor example, positions before: (x0,y0), (x1,y1), ..., (xn,yn)\n\nAfter move to (x_new,y_new) with eat: new positions: (x_new,y_new), (x0,y0), (x1,y1), ..., (xn,yn)\n\nSo the tail is still at (xn,yn), but now it's not the tail, it's the second last, and the new tail is at (xn,yn).\n\nIn terms of cells, the cell (xn,yn) is still occupied, but now by a body segment, and the new tail is also at (xn,yn)? No, the positions are extended.\n\nFor example, before: head A, body B, C, tail D.\n\nAfter eat at E: head E, body A, B, C, and new tail at D? But D is already there.\n\nNew positions: head E, then the first body segment is at A (old head), then B, then C, and tail at D. So D is still the tail position, but now it's the same as before, but the snake is longer.\n\nThe cell D is occupied, and it is the tail.\n\nIn this case, when you add a new segment, it is at the position where the tail was, so the tail doesn't move, and the new segment is the new tail at the same position, but that means the tail cell has the tail segment, and it doesn't move.\n\nBut in terms of position list, for a snake of length L, before move, positions P0 to P{L-1}\n\nAfter move with eat: new P0 = new position (food), new P1 = old P0, new P2 = old P1, ..., new P{L} = old P{L-1}\n\nSo the new tail is at old P{L-1}, which was the previous tail position.\n\nSo the tail position doesn't change; it just gets a new segment added there.\n\nFor example, in my earlier turn 12: before move, positions (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) tail at (1,1)\n\nMove head to (1,6) eat: new head (1,6), new P1 = old P0 = (1,5), new P2 = old P1 = (1,4), new P3 = old P2 = (1,3), new P4 = old P3 = (1,2), new P5 = old P4 = (1,1) so tail at (1,1)\n\nBut new P5 is at (1,1), which was old tail, so it's fine, positions: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) tail at (1,1)\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly, when eating at (3,5).\n\nBack to the plan.\n\nSo with going up directly, I eat (1,6) on turn 12.\n\nThen turn 13: move R to (2,6) only choice.\n\nThen turn 14: from (2,6), I can move D to (2,5) or R to (3,6).\n\n(3,5) is at (3,5), so moving D to (2,5) gets me closer.\n\nThen turn 15: move R to (3,5) to eat.\n\nIf I move R to (3,6) on turn 14, then turn 15 move D to (3,5) to eat.\n\nEither way, I eat on turn 15.\n\nBut (3,5) life span is long, so no issue.\n\nNow, but at turn 14, moving to (2,5) or (3,6), both fine.\n\nBut (3,6) is closer to the obstacle, but (5,6) is far, so no problem.\n\nAlso, I need to consider if the snake might collide with itself.\n\nFor example, after eating (3,5), the snake will be longer.\n\nBut since I'm moving to open areas, should be fine.\n\nAnother thing: the tail reward danger.\n\nBut in this case, no food on tail, so no issue.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions starting from turn 8.\n\nAt turn 8, action U.\n\nThen for turn 9, I plan to move U.\n\nBut I need to output multiple turns.\n\nThe answer format is to output for turns t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nt1=8.\n\nSo I can output up to say turn 12 or 13.\n\nSince thinking 5+ turns ahead, output 5 actions.\n\nBut the state may change, but based on current info.\n\nAlso, for turn 9, I decided to move U, but is there a reason to move R? Earlier I saw that moving R might miss the food, so U is better.\n\nMoreover, moving U is towards food, less risky.\n\nNow, another point: the internal obstacle at (5,6), but I'm not going there, so fine.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 8: U (only choice)\n\nTurn 9: U (to go towards (1,6))\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U (eat at (1,6))\n\nNow, for turn 13, as above, must move R.\n\nBut turn 13 is t1+5.\n\nt1=8, turn 13 is t1+5.\n\nI can output up to turn 13.\n\nBut let's see the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 11, I move to (1,5), then turn 12 to (1,6) eat.\n\nAt turn 13, from (1,6) to (2,6) R.\n\nNow, I should output actions from turn 8 to at least turn 12.\n\nPerhaps 5 turns: turn 8 to 12.\n\nBut turn 13 is also determined.\n\nSince the format might expect multiple turns.\n\nNow, but for turn 9, I have a choice, but I choose U.\n\nIn the state, at turn 9, after moving U on turn 8, I have options, but I plan to go U.\n\nTo be complete, I can output the sequence.\n\nAlso, the problem says \"prioritize long-term survival\", but in this case, going up seems safe.\n\nIs there any risk in going up?\n\nFor example, after reaching (1,6), I have to move right, which is fine.\n\nIf I had gone right at turn 9, I might get stuck or miss food.\n\nSo U is better.\n\nMoreover, the food at (3,5) can be eaten later.\n\nNow, about the tail: when I eat at (1,6), the tail is at (1,1), which is far.\n\nNo issue.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 8, the snake has a loop: positions (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), which is like a small square, but after moving up, it straightens out.\n\nFor example, after turn 8 move U to (1,2), positions (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2)\n\nThen after turn 9 U to (1,3), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1)\n\nAnd so on, so it becomes a straight line vertically.\n\nThen after eating, longer vertical line.\n\nThen moving right.\n\nAll seems fine.\n\nTherefore, for the answer:\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U (eat)\n\nI can include turn 13: R\n\nBut since the format might be flexible, output for 5 turns or so.\n\nThe instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so outputting 5 actions is fine.\n\nFrom turn 8 to 12, that's 5 actions.\n\nt1 to t1+4.\n\nt1=8, turn 8,9,10,11,12: 5 turns.\n\nYes.\n\nActions: all U except the last is U to eat.\n\nBut for turn 12, it's U to (1,6) eat.\n\nIn the actions, I just specify the direction.\n\nNow, to confirm, at turn 11, I move to (1,5), which is not food, then turn 12 to (1,6) eat.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\n}\n\nBut is there a need to go beyond? I think this is sufficient.\n\nSince I thought about turn 13, but not necessary to output.\n\nIn this sequence, I eat on turn 12, which is good.\n\nAnd I can survive.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if moving R at some point is better, but I don't think so.\n\nFor example, at turn 9, if I move R to (2,2), then I might not get the food, so worse.\n\nTherefore, this plan is good.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n**Current State (Turn 8):**\n- **Grid**: 8x8 (cells from (0,0) to (7,7)), with walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacle at (5,6).\n- **Snake**: \n  - Positions: head at (1,1), body at (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), tail at (2,2). Length = 5.\n  - Head direction: Left (L), meaning the snake moved left to reach (1,1) from (2,1) on the previous turn.\n- **Food**:\n  - (1,6): value +1, life span 6 (available until turn 13, disappears at turn 14).\n  - (3,5): value +1, life span 9 (available until turn 16, disappears at turn 17).\n\n**Constraints and Risks:**\n- **Movement restrictions from (1,1) on turn 8**:\n  - Left (L) to (0,1): x=0 wall, invalid.\n  - Right (R) to (2,1): occupied by body segment (not tail), collision risk.\n  - Down (D) to (1,0): y=0 wall, invalid.\n  - Up (U) to (1,2): free cell, valid and safe.\n  - Only possible move on turn 8 is U (up).\n- **No instant reverse**: After moving U on turn 8, the new direction is U, so on turn 9, D (down) is invalid as a reverse move.\n- **Food prioritization**: \n  - (1,6) has a short life span (only 6 turns left, must be eaten by turn 13). It is 4 cells away vertically (from (1,2) after turn 8 move). Reaching it by turn 12 is feasible with direct upward moves.\n  - (3,5) has a longer life span (9 turns left), so it can be targeted after (1,6) is eaten.\n- **Path safety**: \n  - Moving directly upward from (1,2) to (1,6) is safe, as cells (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), and (1,6) are free of walls, obstacles, and snake body segments.\n  - After eating (1,6) on turn 12, the snake must move right to (2,6) on turn 13 to avoid collisions (since U, D, and L are invalid).\n- **Tail reward danger**: No food is on the tail in the initial state, and the planned path avoids this risk.\n- **Long-term survival**: By eating (1,6) quickly, the snake gains length and opens space for future moves. After turn 12, the snake can navigate toward (3,5) without immediate risks.\n\n**5+ Turn Plan (Turns 8-12):**\n- **Turn 8 (t1=8)**: Move U to (1,2) – only valid move, no food eaten. Snake length remains 5.\n- **Turn 9**: Move U to (1,3) – toward (1,6), no food, safe. Direction becomes U.\n- **Turn 10**: Move U to (1,4) – continuing toward (1,6), no food, safe.\n- **Turn 11**: Move U to (1,5) – one step from food, no food, safe.\n- **Turn 12**: Move U to (1,6) – eat positive food (+1 score, length increases to 6). Food (1,6) is eaten before it expires (life span 2 at turn start).\n\n**Why this sequence?**\n- **Maximizes score**: Eats (1,6) by turn 12, capturing the immediate high-priority reward before it disappears. Sets up to eat (3,5) later (e.g., on turn 15) for additional score.\n- **Avoids risks**: \n  - Turn 8 U is forced and safe.\n  - Turns 9-12 U moves keep the snake aligned and avoid body/wall collisions.\n  - No alternative paths are better; moving right on turn 9 risks missing (1,6) due to its short life span.\n- **Long-term**: After turn 12, the snake can move R to (2,6) on turn 13, then D to (2,5) on turn 14, and R to (3,5) to eat on turn 15. This ensures survival and scores both foods.\n\n**Output Sequence (Turns 8-12):**\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 9, and the grid is 8x8 because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think? Walls are at x=0 and x=7, so x from 1 to 6? Let me confirm.\n\nWalls: Border cells x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7. Also, internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nSnake positions: head at (1,2), then (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2). So the snake has 5 segments. Head direction is U, which is up.\n\nFood:\n\n- (1,6) with life span 5, value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (3,5) with life span 8, value 1 (positive food)\n\nLife span decreases each turn, including current. So for (1,6), life span 5 at turn 9, so it will disappear after turn 13? Let's see: at turn 9, life span is 5, so it decreases to 4 at turn 10, 3 at 11, 2 at 12, 1 at 13, and gone at turn 14? But since it disappears after N turns, and countdown decreases every turn including current, I think after N turns from spawn, but here it's given with current life span.\n\nThe food has a life span that decreases each turn. So for (1,6), life span 5 at turn 9, meaning it will last until turn 13 (since at turn 9 it has 5, turn 10:4, turn 11:3, turn 12:2, turn 13:1, and at turn 14 it disappears). Similarly, (3,5) with life span 8 at turn 9, will disappear after turn 16.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for turns 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13? The instruction says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should plan at least 5 moves: turn 9 to turn 13 or 14.\n\nAlso, I have to avoid risks and prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid. Walls at borders: so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. Internal obstacle at (5,6), so that cell is blocked.\n\nSnake: head at (1,2), moving up (direction U). Body: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2). So let's list positions:\n\n- Head: (1,2)\n\n- Segment 1: (1,1) — this is directly below head? Head at (1,2), segment at (1,1), so since head is moving up, it was previously moving down to (1,1)? Let's see the positions: snake positions: [(1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2)]\n\nOrder: head first, so (1,2) is head, then (1,1) is next, which is down, then (2,1) which is right, then (3,1) right, then (3,2) up. So the snake body: from head to tail: (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,2)\n\nDirection is U, so current movement is up.\n\nNow, possible moves from (1,2): since direction is U, I can move U, L, or R, but not D because that would be instant reverse? No instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction.\n\nCurrent direction is U, so opposite is D. So I cannot move down. Possible moves: U (up), L (left), R (right).\n\nNow, from (1,2):\n\n- U: to (1,3)\n\n- L: to (0,2) — but x=0 is wall, so invalid.\n\n- R: to (2,2)\n\n- D: not allowed, and also (1,1) is body, but since tail might move, it could be ok, but direction prevents D.\n\nSo from (1,2), possible actions: U or R. L is wall, D not allowed.\n\nU to (1,3) or R to (2,2).\n\nNow, I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n\nFood locations: (1,6) and (3,5), both positive, value 1.\n\n(1,6) has life span 5, so it will disappear after turn 13 (since at turn 9, life=5; turn 10, life=4; ... turn 13, life=1; turn 14, gone. But when is it eaten? If head moves to it when life>0.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) life=8, disappears after turn 16.\n\nAlso, note that food can be under body, but here no food is under body currently. Let's check snake positions: (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2). Food at (1,6) and (3,5), neither is occupied by snake, so ok.\n\nNow, I need to maximize score, so I should try to eat food, but avoid risks, especially the tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills because the new tail grows and collides.\n\nTail is at (3,2). What is the tail position? Snake positions: head (1,2), then (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2) so tail is (3,2).\n\nFood is at (1,6) and (3,5), not at tail, so no immediate danger.\n\nBut if I eat food, the tail grows when I eat, so after eating, the tail doesn't move that turn, I think? Standard snake: when you eat, you grow, so the tail stays in place or something? Let's see the rules.\n\n\"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food, so I think when head moves to food, snake grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn. But in terms of collision, when head moves to a cell with food, it eats it, and the new segment is added, but collision is checked before or after?\n\nRules say: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment)\" and \"But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, normally, when moving, if head moves to a cell that will be vacated by the tail, it's ok, because tail moves away.\n\nBut when eating, if head moves to food, and if that food is where the tail is, but food can be under body, but only eaten if body moves away and head moves there.\n\nSpecifically: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (3,2), no food there.\n\nNow for planning.\n\nFirst, from turn 9, head at (1,2), options: U to (1,3) or R to (2,2).\n\nIf I go U to (1,3), then snake moves: head to (1,3), body follows: (1,2) becomes new segment 1, (1,1) segment 2, etc., tail (3,2) moves? When not eating, tail moves forward.\n\nAfter move, positions: if head to (1,3), then new positions: head (1,3), then previous head (1,2) now body, then (1,1), then (2,1), then (3,1), and tail (3,2) moves? No: the tail moves only if no growth. Since no food eaten, tail moves off the current tail position.\n\nStandard snake movement: when no eat, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front, so the last segment (tail) is removed.\n\nSo new positions: if head moves to (1,3), then:\n\n- New head: (1,3)\n\n- Then the previous positions: first body segment to old head (1,2), second to old first body (1,1), third to old second body (2,1), fourth to old third body (3,1), and the old tail (3,2) is removed? Positions: snake had 5 segments: indices 0:head (1,2), 1:(1,1), 2:(2,1), 3:(3,1), 4:tail (3,2)\n\nAfter move U to (1,3), no eat, so new head at (1,3), then segment 1 at (1,2) (old head), segment 2 at (1,1) (old seg1), segment 3 at (2,1) (old seg2), segment 4 at (3,1) (old seg3), and old seg4 (3,2) is gone. So new positions: [(1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1)]? Let's list:\n\n- New head: (1,3)\n\n- New body: (1,2)  // old head\n\n- New body: (1,1)  // old seg1\n\n- New body: (2,1)  // old seg2\n\n- New tail: (3,1)  // old seg3\n\nOld seg4 (3,2) is removed.\n\nSimilarly, if I move R to (2,2), new positions: head (2,2), then (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1) with tail at (3,1), old tail (3,2) gone.\n\nNow, back to turn 9 choices.\n\nOption 1: U to (1,3)\n\nThen head at (1,3)\n\nFrom there, possible moves: direction now U, so can go U, L, R, not D.\n\nU to (1,4), L to (0,3) wall, invalid, R to (2,3)\n\nSo only U or R from (1,3).\n\nIf U to (1,4), etc.\n\nOption 2: R to (2,2)\n\nThen head at (2,2), direction R? Current direction was U, but after moving R, new direction is R.\n\nThen from (2,2), with direction R, can go U, D, R, not L (opposite).\n\nU to (2,3), D to (2,1), but (2,1) is body? After move, positions: head (2,2), body (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1)\n\nSo (2,1) is a body segment, so if I move D to (2,1), it would collide with body.\n\nSimilarly, R to (3,2), but (3,2) is not occupied now? After move to (2,2), positions: (2,2), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1)\n\nSo cells occupied: (2,2), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1)\n\n(3,2) is free.\n\nSo from (2,2), direction R:\n\n- U: to (2,3) - free\n\n- D: to (2,1) - occupied by body, collision\n\n- R: to (3,2) - free? (3,2) is not occupied, as above.\n\n(3,2) was tail but moved away.\n\nIn positions, after R to (2,2), snake is at (2,2), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), so (3,2) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) is free.\n\nAlso, (2,1) is occupied.\n\nSo possible from (2,2): U to (2,3), R to (3,2), D to (2,1) invalid (body), L not allowed (opposite to R? Current direction after move is R, so L is opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo U or R.\n\nNow, I need to get to food.\n\nFood at (1,6) and (3,5).\n\n(1,6) is at x=1,y=6, which is top row, y=6, since walls at y=7, so y=6 is playable.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) at x=3,y=5.\n\nSnake head at (1,2), so to reach (1,6), need to go up, but there are obstacles? Internal obstacle at (5,6), but (1,6) is different.\n\nPath to (1,6): from (1,2) to (1,6), straight up, but I need to consider the body and walls.\n\nIf I go U now to (1,3), then I can keep going U to (1,4), (1,5), (1,6).\n\nBut when I reach (1,6), I need to eat it, but life span: at turn 9, (1,6) has life 5, so if I go directly up, how many turns?\n\nTurn 9: from (1,2) to (1,3)\n\nTurn 10: from (1,3) to (1,4)\n\nTurn 11: from (1,4) to (1,5)\n\nTurn 12: from (1,5) to (1,6) — at turn 12, head to (1,6), which has food.\n\nLife span at turn 9: 5, turn 10:4, turn 11:3, turn 12:2, so at turn 12, life=2>0, so I can eat it.\n\nThen snake grows to length 6.\n\nBut after eating at (1,6), I am at top row, y=6, and walls at y=7, but y=6 is playable, wall at y=7 is border.\n\nBut I need to survive after that.\n\nIf I go R to (2,2) first, then it might take longer to reach (1,6).\n\nBut (1,6) has shorter life, only 5 turns left, so I might miss it if I don't go soon.\n\n(3,5) has life 8, more time.\n\nSo perhaps prioritize (1,6) since it will disappear sooner.\n\nBut going directly up might be risky because after eating at (1,6), I am at corner, and need to turn.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nOption: go U on turn 9 to (1,3)\n\nThen turn 10: from (1,3), direction U, can go U or R (L wall, D not allowed or invalid? Direction U, so can go U, L, R, but L to (0,3) wall, so U or R.\n\nIf I go U to (1,4)\n\nTurn 11: from (1,4) to U (1,5)\n\nTurn 12: from (1,5) to U (1,6), eat food. Life at turn 12 is 2, so eaten.\n\nNow, after eating, at turn 12, head at (1,6), and since ate, snake grows, so tail doesn't move. Positions: before move to (1,6), snake was at turn 11: let's track positions.\n\nStart turn 9: positions [(1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2)]\n\nTurn 9: move U to (1,3), no eat, so new positions: head (1,3), body: (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1)  // tail at (3,1)\n\nTurn 10: move U to (1,4), no eat, positions: head (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1)  // tail (2,1)? Positions: head to (1,4), then (1,3) [old head], (1,2) [old body1], (1,1) [old body2], (2,1) [old body3], old tail (3,1) gone. So [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1)]\n\nTurn 11: move U to (1,5), no eat, positions: head (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1)  // and (2,1) gone? Head to (1,5), then (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) — all on x=1.\n\nTail at (1,1)\n\nTurn 12: move U to (1,6), which has food, eat it. So head moves to (1,6), eats, so snake grows. New positions: head at (1,6), then the previous body segments stay, and new tail added? When eat, the tail doesn't move, so segments: head at (1,6), then the previous head position becomes body, but since growing, we add a new segment at the tail position or something.\n\nStandard: when head moves to food, it occupies that cell, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so the snake length increases by one, and tail stays where it was.\n\nFor example, before move at turn 11, positions: [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1)]\n\nMove to (1,6) and eat, so new head at (1,6), then the body segments are the previous positions: (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), and since eating, we add a new segment at the old tail position, so (1,1) is still there? No.\n\nTypically: after move, if no eat, tail is removed. If eat, tail is not removed, so the new tail is the old tail.\n\nSo before move: snake at S = [head, body1, body2, ..., tail]\n\nAfter move to new cell:\n\n- If not food, new head = new position, new body = old head, new body2 = old body1, ..., new tail = old tail-1 (last but one), old tail removed.\n\n- If food, new head = new position, new body = old head, new body2 = old body1, ..., new tail = old tail, and since eating, the old tail position is kept, so the snake has one more segment.\n\nSo in this case, turn 11 positions: [ (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) ] with (1,5) head, (1,1) tail.\n\nMove to (1,6), which is food, so eat: new head at (1,6), new body1 at old head (1,5), new body2 at old body1 (1,4), new body3 at old body2 (1,3), new body4 at old body3 (1,2), and new tail at old tail (1,1). Since eating, tail not removed, so positions: [ (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) ] length 6.\n\nNow, at turn 12, head at (1,6), direction U (since last move U).\n\nNow, from (1,6), possible moves: U to (1,7), but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n\nL to (0,6) x=0 wall, invalid.\n\nR to (2,6)\n\nD to (1,5), but (1,5) is body? Positions: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), etc., so (1,5) is body segment, so moving D to (1,5) would collide.\n\nDirection U, so cannot move D? Direction U, opposite is D, so cannot move down.\n\nPossible moves: U invalid (wall), L invalid (wall), R to (2,6), D not allowed.\n\nSo only R to (2,6) possible.\n\nTurn 12: after eating, head at (1,6), must move R to (2,6).\n\nThen, move to (2,6), no food there? (2,6) may have food? Food is at (1,6) eaten, and (3,5), so (2,6) no food.\n\nSo no eat, new positions: head to (2,6), then body: old head (1,6) becomes body, then (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), and tail (1,1) removed? Since no eat.\n\nPositions: new head (2,6), new body1 (1,6), new body2 (1,5), new body3 (1,4), new body4 (1,3), new tail (1,2)  // old tail (1,1) gone.\n\nList: before move: [ (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) ]\n\nMove to (2,6) not food, so new head (2,6), new body1 (1,6), new body2 (1,5), new body3 (1,4), new body4 (1,3), new tail (1,2), and (1,1) removed. So positions: [(2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]? New tail is (1,2), which was body4 before.\n\nSegments: after move: head (2,6), then the segments are: position of previous head and bodies except the last is removed.\n\nPrevious: index 0: (1,6) head, 1: (1,5), 2: (1,4), 3: (1,3), 4: (1,2), 5: (1,1) tail\n\nMove to (2,6) not food, so new head (2,6), new body1: old head (1,6), new body2: old body1 (1,5), new body3: old body2 (1,4), new body4: old body3 (1,3), new tail: old body4 (1,2), and old tail (1,1) removed. So positions: [(2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]\n\nNow head at (2,6), direction? Last move was R to (2,6), so direction R.\n\nFrom (2,6), possible moves: U to (2,7) wall, invalid; D to (2,5); L to (1,6) but (1,6) is body, collision; R to (3,6).\n\nDirection R, so cannot move L (opposite).\n\nSo possible: D to (2,5) or R to (3,6).\n\n(2,5) is free, (3,6) may be free.\n\nFood at (3,5), which is close.\n\nBut let's see the situation.\n\nIf I go D to (2,5), or R to (3,6).\n\nBut at (2,6), I can go to (3,6) or (2,5).\n\nNow, the body is at (1,6), (1,5), etc., so (2,5) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,6) should be free.\n\nBut there is an internal obstacle at (5,6), but (3,6) is different.\n\nAfter turn 12, I need to continue.\n\nBut this is one path: by going straight up, I can eat (1,6) at turn 12.\n\nThen I have to move right to (2,6), and then I can go down or right to reach other areas.\n\nBut let's check the other food (3,5).\n\n(3,5) has life 8, so I have time.\n\nBut in this path, after eating (1,6), I am at (2,6) at turn 13 or something.\n\nTurn 12: ate (1,6), then moved to (2,6) at turn 12? Turn 12 is when I move to (1,6) and eat, but the move to (1,6) is on turn 12, and I eat, then on the same turn I have to choose next action? No, each turn I move once.\n\nTurn 12: I move to (1,6) and eat.\n\nThen for turn 13, I need to move from (1,6), but as above, only possible move is R to (2,6).\n\nThen turn 13: head at (2,6), move to, say, (2,5) or (3,6).\n\nThen I can go to (3,5) from there.\n\nFor example, from (2,6) to (3,6) to (3,5) or something.\n\n(3,5) is at y=5, so from (3,6) down to (3,5).\n\nBut (3,5) has food, I can eat it if I go there.\n\nBut let's see if I have time; life span at turn 9 is 8, so at turn 13, life = 8 - (13-9) = ? Turn 9: life=8, turn 10:7, turn 11:6, turn 12:5, turn 13:4, etc., so plenty of time.\n\nBut in this path, I ate (1,6) early.\n\nNow, what about the risk? When I was at (1,5) going to (1,6), the cell (1,6) was free, no issue.\n\nBut after eating, when I move to (2,6), the body is behind me, but I can move.\n\nAnother option: instead of going straight up, I could go right first on turn 9.\n\nTurn 9: move R to (2,2)\n\nThen positions: head (2,2), then (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1)  // tail at (3,1)\n\nDirection now R.\n\nTurn 10: from (2,2), can go U to (2,3) or R to (3,2) (since D to (2,1) body, invalid; L not allowed)\n\nIf I go U to (2,3), or R to (3,2).\n\nIf I go R to (3,2), then head to (3,2), no food, positions: head (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1)  // tail (2,1)\n\nThen from (3,2), direction R, can go U, D, R.\n\nU to (3,3), D to (3,1) but (3,1) is body? Positions: (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), so (3,1) is free? (3,1) was tail but moved away, so free.\n\nD to (3,1) is free.\n\nR to (4,2), etc.\n\nBut I need to get to (1,6) or (3,5).\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), which is left and up.\n\nFrom (3,2), I can go U to (3,3), then (3,4), (3,5) to eat (3,5).\n\n(3,5) has food, so if I go to (3,5) directly.\n\nFrom current, if on turn 9 I go R to (2,2), turn 10 go R to (3,2), turn 11 from (3,2) go U to (3,3), turn 12 U to (3,4), turn 13 U to (3,5) eat.\n\nAt turn 13, life of (3,5): turn 9:8, turn10:7, ..., turn13:4, so yes.\n\nBut (1,6) might expire; at turn 13, life of (1,6): turn9:5, turn10:4, turn11:3, turn12:2, turn13:1, turn14 gone. So at turn13, if I go to (1,6), life=1>0, can eat, but I am going to (3,5) on turn13.\n\nIf I want to eat both, I need a path.\n\nBut (1,6) is on the other side.\n\nAfter eating (3,5), I can go to (1,6) but it might be gone.\n\nTurn13: (1,6) life=1, so if I can reach on turn13, I can eat, but from (3,5) to (1,6) is far, need to go left and down or something.\n\n(3,5) to (1,6): x from 3 to 1, y from 5 to 6, so left and up, but y=5 to y=6, up one, x from 3 to 1, left two cells.\n\nBut with snake body, it might be tight.\n\nBut life of (1,6) at turn13 is 1, so if not eaten on turn13, gone on turn14.\n\nBut on turn13, I am at (3,5) if I ate it, or elsewhere.\n\nIn the first path, I ate (1,6) on turn12.\n\nNow, back to turn9 decision.\n\nI need to think about the grid and obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,6), which might block some paths, but not immediately relevant.\n\nAlso, the tail position: when I move, the tail moves, so space opens up.\n\nBut in the straight up path, I ended up with a long vertical snake, which might be risky if I need to turn.\n\nIn the first scenario, after eating (1,6) and moving to (2,6), I have positions [(2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)] so it's mostly on x=1 except head at (2,6).\n\nThen from (2,6), I can go to (2,5) or (3,6).\n\nIf I go to (3,6), then to (3,5) to eat the other food.\n\n(3,5) is at (3,5), so from (3,6) down to (3,5).\n\nTurn 13: from (2,6) move to, say, (3,6) — assuming I choose that.\n\nThen positions: head to (3,6), no food, new positions: head (3,6), then (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), tail (1,2) removed? No eat, so new head (3,6), body1 (2,6), body2 (1,6), body3 (1,5), body4 (1,4), tail (1,3)  // (1,2) gone.\n\nThen turn 14: from (3,6), direction? Last move R to (3,6), so direction R.\n\nCan go U to (3,7) wall, D to (3,5), L to (2,6) body, R to (4,6).\n\n(2,6) is body, so L invalid.\n\nD to (3,5) has food, so I can move there and eat.\n\nMove to (3,5), which has food, so eat it.\n\nThen snake grows.\n\nPositions before move: [ (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) ]\n\nMove to (3,5), eat, so new head (3,5), new body1 (3,6), new body2 (2,6), new body3 (1,6), new body4 (1,5), new body5 (1,4), new tail (1,3)  // since eating, tail not removed, so (1,3) kept.\n\nThen I have eaten both foods.\n\nBut in this path, I ate (1,6) on turn12 and (3,5) on turn14.\n\nTurn12 ate (1,6), turn14 ate (3,5).\n\nNow, what if on turn9 I go R instead?\n\nTurn9: move R to (2,2)\n\nPositions: head (2,2), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1)\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn10: from (2,2), can go U to (2,3) or R to (3,2)\n\nSuppose I go U to (2,3) to start heading up.\n\nThen positions: head (2,3), (2,2), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1)  // tail (2,1)\n\nTurn11: from (2,3), direction U (since moved U), can go U to (2,4), L to (1,3), R to (3,3)\n\nD not allowed.\n\n(1,3) free? Positions: (2,3), (2,2), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), so (1,3) free, (3,3) free.\n\nTo go to (1,6), I need to go left and up.\n\nBut (1,6) life: at turn11, life=3 (turn9:5,10:4,11:3)\n\nIf I go directly to (1,6): from (2,3) to (1,3) turn11, then (1,4) turn12, (1,5) turn13, (1,6) turn14.\n\nAt turn14, (1,6) life: turn14, from turn9: decreased by 5 turns? Turn9 to turn14 is 5 turns passed, so life at turn9:5, turn10:4, turn11:3, turn12:2, turn13:1, turn14:0? But disappears after N turns, meaning when life=0 it is gone or at life=0 it can be eaten?\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\".\n\nSo at turn t, if life_span = L, it exists for this turn and will disappear after L more turns? Better to think: at turn t, it has life_span L, meaning it will last for L more turns, including current, so it can be eaten in the next L turns, and disappears at turn t+L.\n\nFor (1,6) at turn9, life=5, so disappears after turn 9+5 = turn14. Meaning at turn14, it is still there? Or gone?\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\".\n\nI think: at turn t, with life_span L, it will be present for turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1, and disappear at turn t+L.\n\nFor example, L=5 at t=9: present at t=9,10,11,12,13; gone at t=14.\n\nSimilarly, L=8 at t=9: present t=9 to t=16, gone t=17.\n\nIn the first path, I ate (1,6) at turn12, which is within 9 to 13, ok.\n\nIn this alternative, if I go to (1,6) at turn14, it is gone, since disappears after turn13.\n\nTurn14 it is not present.\n\nSo I cannot eat (1,6) on turn14; last chance turn13 with life=1.\n\nIn this path, if I go to (1,6) on turn14, it's gone.\n\nTo eat (1,6), I need to be there by turn13.\n\nFrom turn9, if I go R to (2,2), then to reach (1,6) by turn13.\n\nTurn9: at (1,2) move R to (2,2)\n\nTurn10: at (2,2) move to, say, L? But direction R, cannot move L, only U or R.\n\nIf U to (2,3)\n\nTurn11: from (2,3) can move L to (1,3) since direction U, L is allowed.\n\nThen to (1,3)\n\nTurn12: from (1,3) move U to (1,4)\n\nTurn13: from (1,4) move U to (1,5) — but to reach (1,6) on turn13, I need to be at (1,5) on turn12? Let's see positions.\n\nAfter turn9: move R to (2,2), positions: [(2,2), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1)]\n\nTurn10: move U to (2,3), positions: head (2,3), (2,2), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1)  // tail (2,1)\n\nTurn11: move L to (1,3), direction now L? After moving L from U direction, new direction L.\n\nPositions: head (1,3), (2,3)? Previous head (2,3) to new head (1,3), then body: old head (2,3), then (2,2), (1,2), (1,1), tail (2,1) removed? No eat, so new head (1,3), body1 (2,3), body2 (2,2), body3 (1,2), tail (1,1)  // (2,1) gone.\n\nNow head at (1,3), direction L.\n\nTurn12: from (1,3), can move U to (1,4), D to (1,2) body, L to (0,3) wall, R not allowed (opposite to L).\n\nSo only U to (1,4)\n\nMove to (1,4), no food, positions: head (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (1,2)  // tail (1,2)? New head (1,4), body1 (1,3), body2 (2,3), body3 (2,2), tail (1,2)  // old tail (1,1) gone.\n\n(1,2) is tail, but it was body before.\n\nTurn13: from (1,4) move U to (1,5) (only choice, since direction U? Last move U to (1,4), so direction U.\n\nCan move U to (1,5), L wall, R to (2,4), D not allowed.\n\n(2,4) free? Positions: (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (1,2), so (2,4) free, (1,5) free.\n\nSo can go U to (1,5) or R to (2,4).\n\nBut to reach (1,6), I need to go to (1,5) first.\n\nIf U to (1,5) on turn13, then (1,6) is not reached; I am at (1,5) on turn13, and (1,6) can be eaten on turn14, but it disappears after turn13, so on turn14 it's gone.\n\nThus, I cannot eat (1,6) if I go this way; I miss it.\n\nIf on turn10 from (2,2) I go R to (3,2) instead.\n\nTurn9: R to (2,2)\n\nTurn10: R to (3,2), positions: head (3,2), (2,2), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1)  // tail (2,1)? Positions: head (3,2), body1 (2,2), body2 (1,2), body3 (1,1), tail (2,1)  // (3,1) gone? After move to (3,2), no eat, new head (3,2), body1 (2,2), body2 (1,2), body3 (1,1), tail (2,1)  // old tail (3,1) gone.\n\nThen from (3,2), I can go to (3,5) faster.\n\nTurn11: from (3,2) U to (3,3)\n\nTurn12: U to (3,4)\n\nTurn13: U to (3,5) eat.\n\nBut (1,6) is not eaten and disappears.\n\nSo to eat (1,6), I must go towards it directly from turn9, meaning move U to (1,3).\n\nOtherwise, I miss it.\n\nMoreover, (1,6) is the only food with short life, so I should eat it to not waste the opportunity.\n\nThen later I can eat (3,5).\n\nIn the first path, I can eat both.\n\nBut in the first path, after eating (1,6) at turn12, and moving to (2,6) at turn12? Turn12 move to (1,6) eat, then turn13 move to (2,6), then turn14 move to (3,6) or (2,5), then to (3,5).\n\nFor (3,5), I can eat it at turn14 or 15.\n\nLife: at turn14, life=8 - (14-9) = 8-5=3? Turn9:8, turn10:7, turn11:6, turn12:5, turn13:4, turn14:3, so turn14 life=3>0.\n\nIf from (2,6) on turn13, I go to (3,6), then on turn14 from (3,6) go D to (3,5) and eat.\n\nAs I had earlier.\n\nNow, about the internal obstacle at (5,6), it doesn't affect this path.\n\nBut I need to think about long-term survival.\n\nAfter eating both, the snake is longer, and I need to avoid colliding.\n\nBut the grid has space.\n\nAnother thing: tail reward danger, but here no food under tail.\n\nAlso, when moving, I need to ensure I don't trap myself.\n\nIn the vertical snake scenario, after eating (1,6) and moving right, the body is on the left column, so I have room to move.\n\nFor example, from (2,6), I can go down to (2,5), then (2,4), etc., or right to (3,6), etc.\n\nBut (3,6) is at y=6, same as (2,6).\n\nThen to (3,5).\n\nAfter eating (3,5), head at (3,5), and body around.\n\nBut let's list positions after eating (3,5).\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn14: from (3,6) move D to (3,5) and eat.\n\nBefore move, positions at turn13: after moving to (3,6) on turn13? Let's clarify turns.\n\nIn first path:\n\nTurn9: move U to (1,3)  // head at (1,3)\n\nTurn10: move U to (1,4)  // head at (1,4)\n\nTurn11: move U to (1,5)  // head at (1,5)\n\nTurn12: move U to (1,6) and eat  // head at (1,6), ate, snake length 6\n\nThen for turn12, after eating, we have positions, but for turn13, we move from (1,6) to (2,6), as only choice.\n\nTurn13: move R to (2,6)  // no eat, positions: head (2,6), body (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)  // tail (1,2)\n\nTurn14: from (2,6), direction R, can go D to (2,5) or R to (3,6) (U wall, L body)\n\nIf I go R to (3,6), move to (3,6) no food, positions: head (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)  // tail (1,3)\n\nThen turn15: from (3,6), direction R, can go D to (3,5) which has food, so move to (3,5) and eat.\n\nEat at turn15.\n\nLife of (3,5): at turn15, from turn9: decreased by 6 turns? Turn9:8, turn10:7, ..., turn15:8-6=2? Turn9:8, turn10:7, turn11:6, turn12:5, turn13:4, turn14:3, turn15:2, so life=2>0, eaten.\n\nThen snake grows to length 7.\n\nAfter that, head at (3,5), and I can continue moving.\n\nBut I need to think 5+ turns ahead, so up to turn14 or so.\n\nIn this plan, I have actions for turn9 to turn13, but turn13 is moving to (2,6), not eating yet.\n\nThe answer should be actions starting from turn9.\n\nNow, for turn9, I choose U.\n\nThen turn10: U\n\nTurn11: U\n\nTurn12: U to (1,6) eat\n\nThen turn13: must move R to (2,6)\n\nNow, for turn14, I can choose, but I need to specify only up to the point required? The answer format should be actions for turn9,10,11,12,13, I think, since 5 turns.\n\n\"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the answer should show actions for the current and next few turns.\n\nIn the format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ... } so for t1=9, I need to output actions for turn9,10,11,12,13 probably.\n\nIn my plan, turn9: U\n\nTurn10: U\n\nTurn11: U\n\nTurn12: U\n\nTurn13: R\n\nThen after that, I can go to (3,6) on turn14, etc., but for the answer, up to turn13 might be sufficient.\n\nBut I need to ensure that after turn13, I can reach (3,5) safely.\n\nIn turn13, head at (2,6), and I move R to (3,6), then turn14 to (3,5).\n\nBut (3,5) is one step away.\n\nIn turn13 positions: head (2,6), body (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)\n\nAfter moving to (3,6), positions: head (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) // tail (1,3)\n\nThen (3,5) is free and has food, so moving D to (3,5) is safe.\n\nDirection from (3,6) is R, so moving D is allowed, not opposite.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nIf on turn13 from (2,6) I go D to (2,5), then I might go to (3,5) later, but it might take longer, but since (3,5) has life, it's ok, but going right is direct.\n\nIn this case, with U on turn9, I can eat both foods.\n\nIf I go R on turn9, I might miss (1,6).\n\nMoreover, going straight up seems efficient.\n\nBut is there a risk? For example, when I am at (1,5) on turn11, going to (1,6) on turn12, the cell (1,6) is free, no body, so safe.\n\nAfter that, moving right is the only way, but it's safe.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (5,6), but it's not in the way.\n\nAlso, walls, but I am not near them except when at (1,6).\n\nBut I moved away.\n\nSo this seems good.\n\nPerhaps I can eat (3,5) first, but with longer life, but (1,6) might expire, so better to get it first.\n\nSince both have value 1, and (1,6) expires soon, prioritize it.\n\nSo for turn9, action should be U.\n\nThen the sequence: turn9 U, turn10 U, turn11 U, turn12 U, turn13 R.\n\nBut on turn12, I move U to (1,6) and eat, then on turn13 I move R to (2,6).\n\nIn the actions, I just specify the move for each turn.\n\nNow, for turn13, moving R to (2,6) is part of the plan to reach (3,5).\n\nBut in the 5 turns, I have actions.\n\nPerhaps I should write the actions.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is a better way.\n\nAnother possibility: on turn9, if I go R to (2,2), then I can go to (3,2), then up to (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) to eat (3,5) by turn13.\n\nTurn9: R to (2,2)\n\nTurn10: R to (3,2)\n\nTurn11: U to (3,3)\n\nTurn12: U to (3,4)\n\nTurn13: U to (3,5) eat.\n\nThen I eat (3,5) on turn13, but (1,6) disappears at turn14, so I can try to reach it on turn13, but from (3,5) to (1,6) is not possible in one turn, and on turn13 I am eating (3,5), so I cannot reach (1,6) on turn13; it is at (1,6), I am at (3,5), too far. And on turn14, (1,6) gone. So I miss (1,6).\n\nThus, I get only one food instead of two.\n\nBy going U first, I get both.\n\nTherefore, better to go U on turn9.\n\nMoreover, for long-term, eating both increases length, which might help in survival, but also makes the snake larger, harder to maneuver, but in this grid, with internal obstacle, but I think manageable.\n\nSo I think the plan is good.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to specify actions for turn9 to turn13.\n\nTurn9: U\n\nTurn10: U (from (1,3) to (1,4))\n\nTurn11: U (from (1,4) to (1,5))\n\nTurn12: U (from (1,5) to (1,6))\n\nTurn13: R (from (1,6) to (2,6))\n\nAfter that, I can go to (3,6) or down, but for the answer, up to turn13 is fine.\n\nSince thinking 5 turns ahead, this covers.\n\nIn the sequence, on turn13, I am at (2,6), and (3,5) is still available.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should include one more to show I can eat the second food, but the format doesn't specify how many, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", and \"...\" in answer, I can do 5 actions.\n\nIn the boxed, I need to write the actions.\n\nSo for turn9: U\n\nTurn10: U\n\nTurn11: U\n\nTurn12: U\n\nTurn13: R\n\nBut let's write the directions.\n\nAlso, in turn13, moving R to (2,6) is correct.\n\nTo be precise.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, the AI must prioritize eating the positive food at (1,6) due to its short remaining life span (5 turns at turn 9, disappearing after turn 13). The food at (3,5) has a longer life span (8 turns) and can be targeted later. The initial plan involves moving up directly to reach (1,6) by turn 12, then moving right to (2,6) on turn 13 to set up for accessing (3,5) in subsequent turns. This path avoids collisions and leverages the available space.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Food Prioritization**: (1,6) must be eaten by turn 13 to avoid expiration. (3,5) can be eaten later (up to turn 16).\n- **Movement Safety**: \n  - From turn 9 head position (1,2) with direction U, moving up or right is valid (left is wall, down is reverse and invalid).\n  - Moving up immediately is efficient for reaching (1,6) in 4 turns.\n  - After eating at (1,6) on turn 12, moving right to (2,6) on turn 13 is the only safe option (up and left are walls, down is body collision).\n- **Collision Avoidance**: \n  - No food is under the snake's body, eliminating tail reward danger.\n  - The internal obstacle at (5,6) does not affect this path.\n  - Wall and body collisions are avoided by valid moves.\n- **Long-Term Path**: After turn 13, the snake can move to (3,6) or (2,5) to approach (3,5), ensuring both foods are eaten while maintaining survivability.\n\n### Planned Actions (Turns 9-13):\n- **Turn 9 (current)**: Move U (up) to (1,3) – positions become [(1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1)], direction U.\n- **Turn 10**: Move U to (1,4) – positions become [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1)], direction U.\n- **Turn 11**: Move U to (1,5) – positions become [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1)], direction U.\n- **Turn 12**: Move U to (1,6) and eat the food (life span 2 > 0) – positions become [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1)] (length 6), direction U.\n- **Turn 13**: Move R (right) to (2,6) – positions become [(2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)], direction R.\n\nThis sequence eats (1,6) on turn 12 and positions the snake to eat (3,5) on turn 14 or 15 (e.g., move to (3,6) on turn 14, then to (3,5) on turn 15), maximizing score with minimal risk. The actions for turns 14+ can adapt based on the state after turn 13.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: R\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 10, and the grid is 8x8 because walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7). There's an internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nSnake positions: head at (1,3), then (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1). So the snake is moving upward, since head direction is U, and positions go from (1,3) down to (1,2), (1,1), then right to (2,1), (3,1). Head direction U means it was moving up to (1,3) from (1,2), I think. Let's clarify.\n\nHead is at (1,3), and direction is U, which is up, so y increases up? Typically in grids, y=0 is bottom or top? The movement says U (x,y+1), so y+1 is up, meaning y increases as you go up. But in the positions, snake is at (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), which are decreasing y, so if y=1 is bottom, moving from (1,1) to (1,2) to (1,3) would be up, but positions are listed head first: [(1,3), (1,2), (1,1), ...], so (1,3) is head, then (1,2) is the next segment, which is below it since y=2 < y=3? I need to define the coordinate system.\n\nMovement: U (x,y+1) – so if y increases, it's up. D (x,y-1) – y decreases down. So higher y is up, lower y is down.\n\nSnake positions: head at (1,3), then (1,2), which is directly below because y=2 < y=3, so the snake was moving down to (1,3)? But head direction is U, which is up. Inconsistency.\n\nHead direction is given as U, meaning the current direction the head is facing, which is up. But the positions: from (1,2) to (1,3) is moving up, since y increased from 2 to 3. Positions are listed as [(1,3), (1,2), (1,1), ...], so (1,3) is head, (1,2) is the segment behind it, meaning the snake moved from (1,2) to (1,3) on the last move, which is up, so direction U makes sense. Then (1,2) to (1,1) is down? No, the segments are connected; the body segments follow the path.\n\nLet's trace: the snake body is at (1,3) head, then (1,2), so neck, then (1,1), then (2,1), then (3,1) tail. So the snake was at turn 9: head at (1,2), then moved up to (1,3) at turn 10, so now head at (1,3), direction U.\n\nFood:\n\n- (1,6) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (3,5) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (5,5) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, value 1 each.\n\nLife span: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at turn 10, food at (1,6) has life span 4, so it will disappear after turn 13? Let's see: life span N means it disappears after N turns from now, so if life span is L at turn t, it will be gone at turn t + L. But countdown decreases every turn, including current, so at turn t, life span L, at turn t+1, it becomes L-1, and so on, until L=0, it disappears. So at turn t, with life span L, it will be present for L more turns, including turn t, so it disappears at turn t + L.\n\nFor (1,6): turn 10, life span 4, so present at turns 10,11,12,13; gone at turn 14.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5): life span 7, present turns 10 to 16, gone at 17.\n\n(5,5): life span 10, present turns 10 to 19, gone at 20.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves for multiple turns ahead. The answer should be for turns starting from t1=10, so I need to output actions for turn 10, 11, 12, etc., but how many? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so probably plan for at least 5 turns, but the output might be for several turns. The answer format says to list actions for multiple turns, like Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, etc. But it doesn't specify how many; I think I should plan a sequence.\n\nSince the snake needs to eat food and avoid risks, I should consider paths to the food while avoiding collisions and walls.\n\nFirst, current head position: (1,3), direction U (up).\n\nPossible moves: I can move U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n\nNo instant reverse: current direction U, so I cannot move D (down) next, because that would be reverse. So possible moves: U (up), L (left), R (right). D is not allowed because reverse.\n\nMovement constraints: cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is U, so opposite is D, so cannot move D. So allowed: U, L, R.\n\nNow, let's see what each move does:\n\n- U (up): to (1,4)\n\n- L (left): to (0,3)\n\n- R (right): to (2,3)\n\nBut walls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So x=0 is wall, y=0 wall, etc.\n\nMoving L to (0,3): x=0 is wall, so cannot move there. Similarly, y=0 and y=7 walls.\n\nSo from (1,3), possible moves:\n\n- U to (1,4): y=4, within 1 to 6? y from 0 to 7, walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 and y=7 are walls, so cells from y=1 to y=6 are free, but walls are at the borders, so moving to x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nSo from (1,3):\n\n- U to (1,4): (1,4) is not wall, and not occupied by snake? Snake positions: (1,3) head, (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1). So (1,4) is not in snake body, so free.\n\n- L to (0,3): x=0 is wall, invalid.\n\n- R to (2,3): (2,3) not wall, not snake body, free.\n\n- D not allowed, but even if, to (1,2), which is occupied by snake body, so collision.\n\nSo possible actions: U or R.\n\nNow, I need to think about food and future moves.\n\nFood at (1,6), (3,5), (5,5).\n\n(1,6) is directly above, at same x=1, y=6.\n\ny=6, but walls at y=7, so (1,6) is valid.\n\nFrom (1,3), moving U multiple times: to (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) would reach the food in 3 moves, but need to consider the path.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) is at x=3,y=5, which is right and up.\n\n(5,5) is further right.\n\nAlso, life spans: (1,6) has short life, only 4 turns, so it might disappear soon if not eaten.\n\nPresent turns 10,11,12,13; so to eat on turn 13 or before.\n\nSimilarly, others have longer life.\n\nBut eating (1,6) seems tempting, but let's see the risks.\n\nFirst, if I move U to (1,4), then from there, I can go to (1,5) or other directions.\n\nBut the snake body: after moving, the tail moves, so positions change.\n\nAlso, need to avoid colliding with body or walls.\n\nMoreover, Tail Reward Danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (3,1). Head at (1,3), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right.\n\n(1,3) and (3,1) are not adjacent; (1,3) to (2,3) is adjacent, etc.\n\nNow, let's plan possible paths.\n\nFirst, option: go for (1,6).\n\nFrom (1,3), move U to (1,4) on turn 10.\n\nThen from (1,4), can move U to (1,5), or L/R, but L to (0,4) invalid, R to (2,4).\n\nIf move U to (1,5) on turn 11.\n\nThen from (1,5), can move U to (1,6) to eat food on turn 12.\n\nBut is that safe?\n\nAfter eating, snake grows, so new tail is added.\n\nCurrent snake length: 5 segments. After eating positive food, length increases by 1.\n\nNow, when moving to (1,6) on turn 12, food is eaten, so snake grows to 6 segments.\n\nBut need to check if (1,6) is safe to eat.\n\nIs head adjacent to tail? Tail is at (3,1), head at (1,5) before moving? Let's simulate positions.\n\nAt turn 10: snake positions before move: head (1,3), body (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1) tail.\n\nAfter move U to (1,4): new head at (1,4), then body segments: (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1). Tail (3,1) is removed? When snake moves, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to previous position of the segment ahead, and tail is removed if no growth.\n\nSince no food eaten, tail is removed, so new positions: head (1,4), then (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1). Tail was (3,1), but since no growth, it disappears, so snake now at [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1)]\n\n(2,1) is the new tail? Positions: head (1,4), then the segment that was at (1,3) is now at where? When head moves to new cell, the neck moves to old head position, and so on.\n\nStandard snake movement: when moving without growth, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the last segment (tail) is vacated.\n\nSo from positions: before move, segments: index 0: (1,3) head, 1: (1,2), 2: (1,1), 3: (2,1), 4: (3,1) tail.\n\nAfter move U to (1,4): new head at (1,4), then segment 1 moves to old head (1,3), segment 2 moves to old segment1 (1,2), segment 3 moves to old segment2 (1,1), segment 4 moves to old segment3 (2,1). Old tail (3,1) is left, but since no growth, it is removed, so tail is now at (2,1).\n\nNew positions: [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1)]\n\n(1,1) and (2,1) are both occupied.\n\nTail at (2,1).\n\nNow turn 11: from (1,4), move U to (1,5): new head (1,5), body: (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1). Tail was (2,1), but after move, segment4 moves to (1,1)? Let's see: positions before move: head (1,4), then (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1)\n\nAfter move U to (1,5): new head (1,5), segment1 moves to (1,4), segment2 to (1,3), segment3 to (1,2), segment4 to (1,1). Old tail (2,1) removed. So positions: [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1)]\n\nTail at (1,1).\n\nNow turn 12: move U to (1,6): (1,6) has food, positive, so eat it, snake grows. So new head at (1,6), and tail is not removed, so positions: head (1,6), then body: (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), and since growth, add a new segment at the tail position, which was (1,1), so new tail at (1,1), but the tail segment doesn't move when growing? When eating, the head moves to food cell, and a new segment is added at the current tail position before moving, so the tail stays, and snake extends.\n\nStandard: when food eaten, after head moves to food, the tail does not move, so the new segment is added at the previous tail position.\n\nSo before move, positions: head (1,5), body (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), tail (1,1)\n\nAfter move to (1,6) with food: head moves to (1,6), and since food eaten, tail remains, so new positions: head (1,6), then (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), and new segment at (1,1), so tail at (1,1).\n\nNow, snake length 6.\n\nIs there any danger? At this point, head at (1,6), body at (1,5), (1,4), etc.\n\n(1,6) is at y=6, which is one below y=7 wall, so moving up from there would go to (1,7), which is wall, invalid.\n\nAlso, the food at (1,6) is eaten, so gone.\n\nNow, after eating, the snake is vertical at x=1, from y=1 to y=6.\n\nHead at (1,6), so to move, possible directions: since just moved U, direction is U, but at (1,6), y=6, U to (1,7) invalid, so cannot move U. Possible moves: L, R, D. But no reverse? Current direction U, opposite is D, so cannot move D immediately? Movement constraint: no instant reverse, meaning cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nCurrent direction after moving to (1,6) is U, since we moved up.\n\nSo from (1,6), direction U, cannot move D down.\n\nBut moving U is invalid since wall.\n\nSo possible moves: L to (0,6) invalid, R to (2,6).\n\nR to (2,6) is possible, since (2,6) should be free? No obstacles, and not occupied.\n\nAfter that, the snake can move right, etc.\n\nBut at turn 12, after eating, we are at (1,6) with direction U, but stuck because can only move R (since L invalid, U invalid, D not allowed).\n\nMove R to (2,6).\n\nThen from there, can go to other food.\n\nBut let's see if this path is good.\n\nFirst, we can eat (1,6) on turn 12, which is within life span.\n\nBut after that, we are in a corner, and have to move right.\n\nNow, other food: (3,5) and (5,5).\n\n(3,5) is at x=3,y=5.\n\nFrom (1,6), after moving R to (2,6), then we can go down to (2,5), etc.\n\nBut let's think about the Tail Reward Danger.\n\nIn this case, when we ate (1,6), was head adjacent to tail? Before moving to (1,6), head was at (1,5), tail at (1,1). (1,5) and (1,1) are not adjacent; they are 4 apart. So no danger.\n\nNow, but after eating, we are at (1,6), which is near the wall.\n\nAnother option: instead of going straight up, maybe go right first to avoid being trapped.\n\nFrom turn 10, move R to (2,3).\n\nThen from there, we can go to (3,5) or other.\n\nLet's list all food and distances.\n\nFood:\n\n- (1,6): dist from (1,3) is |dy|=3, since same x, so 3 moves up.\n\n- (3,5): from (1,3), dx=2, dy=2, so Manhattan dist 4, but not direct path.\n\n- (5,5): dx=4, dy=2, dist 6.\n\n(1,6) is closest, but short life; must eat by turn 13.\n\n(3,5) life span 7, so by turn 16.\n\n(5,5) by turn 19.\n\nNow, (1,6) might be risky because after eating, we are near wall.\n\nAlso, the snake body is below, so if we go up and eat, the body is behind, but when we move right from (1,6), to (2,6), then we can go down to (2,5), etc.\n\nBut (2,5) might be free.\n\nAnother risk: the internal obstacle at (5,6), but not near yet.\n\nNow, let's consider not going for (1,6) and instead go for (3,5) or (5,5).\n\nBut (1,6) is positive and close, and will disappear soon, so we should eat it if possible.\n\nBut let's see the path to (1,6) is safe, as above.\n\nAfter eating at turn 12, we are at (1,6), must move R to (2,6) on turn 13.\n\nThen from (2,6), direction is R (since moved right), so can move U, D, R, but U to (2,7) invalid (y=7 wall), D to (2,5), L to (1,6) but (1,6) is now body? Positions after turn 12: head (1,6), body (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), tail (1,1)\n\nAfter move R to (2,6) on turn 13: head to (2,6), then body: (1,6) becomes neck, (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), and tail (1,1) removed, no growth? No food, so tail removed, so new tail at (1,2)? Positions: before move: head (1,6), body (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), tail (1,1)\n\nAfter move R to (2,6): new head (2,6), segment1 moves to (1,6), segment2 to (1,5), segment3 to (1,4), segment4 to (1,3), segment5 to (1,2). Old tail (1,1) removed. So positions: [(2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]? Length was 6, after move no food, so length 6, but tail moved.\n\nSegments: index 0: head (1,6), 1: (1,5), 2: (1,4), 3: (1,3), 4: (1,2), 5: (1,1) tail.\n\nAfter move to (2,6): new head (2,6), then segment1 moves to old head (1,6), segment2 to old seg1 (1,5), segment3 to old seg2 (1,4), segment4 to old seg3 (1,3), segment5 to old seg4 (1,2). Old tail (1,1) removed. So positions: head (2,6), then (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2). Tail at (1,2).\n\nNow, from (2,6), can move D to (2,5), or R to (3,6), or L to (1,6) but (1,6) is now body, so collision if move L. U invalid.\n\nSo possible moves: D to (2,5) or R to (3,6).\n\nSay move D to (2,5).\n\nThen from (2,5), we can go to (3,5) to eat food.\n\n(3,5) has food.\n\nAt turn 13, move to (2,5).\n\nThen turn 14, from (2,5), can move to (3,5) to eat.\n\nBut need to see if (3,5) is safe.\n\nFirst, let's go back to turn 10 decision.\n\nI need to think long-term.\n\nAnother option: from turn 10, move R to (2,3) instead of U.\n\nThen from (2,3), can go towards (3,5).\n\n(3,5) is at (3,5), from (2,3), dx=1, dy=2, so can go up then right or right then up.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nAlso, there is food at (5,5), which is farther.\n\nBut (1,6) will disappear soon, so if I don't eat it, it's wasted.\n\nBut is it worth it? Eating it gives +1 score, but after that, I might be in a tight spot.\n\nLet's consider the body positions.\n\nCurrent snake is at (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), so it's like an L shape, with head at (1,3) up, then down to (1,1), then right to (3,1).\n\nThe area above is open, but near the left wall.\n\nIf I go up to (1,6), I might get stuck, but I can move right later.\n\nBut after moving to (2,6) and then (2,5), I can eat (3,5) at (3,5).\n\nFrom (2,5), move R to (3,5) to eat.\n\n(3,5) has life span 7, so at turn 14, it should be present.\n\nTurn 10: move R to (2,3) at turn 10.\n\nThen turn 11: from (2,3), possible moves: U, D, L, R. Direction after move R is R, so cannot move L (reverse).\n\nCurrent direction after turn 10 move to (2,3) is R.\n\nSo can move U, D, R.\n\nU to (2,4), D to (2,2), R to (3,3).\n\nNow, (2,2): is it free? Snake positions after turn 10: after moving to (2,3), positions: head (2,3), then (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1). Tail at (2,1)? Before move: head (1,3), body (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1)\n\nMove R to (2,3): new head (2,3), segment1 to (1,3), segment2 to (1,2), segment3 to (1,1), segment4 to (2,1). Old tail (3,1) removed. So positions: [(2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1)]\n\nTail at (2,1).\n\nFrom (2,3), move U to (2,4) on turn 11: new head (2,4), body (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1). Tail (2,1) removed, so new tail at (1,1)? Positions: head (2,4), then (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1)\n\nThen turn 12: from (2,4), can move U to (2,5), or R to (3,4), etc.\n\nMove U to (2,5) on turn 12.\n\nThen turn 13: from (2,5), move R to (3,5) to eat food.\n\nAt (3,5), food, so eat, grow to length 6.\n\nPositions before move: head (2,5), body (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), tail (1,1)? After turn 12: positions head (2,5), then (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), tail (1,1)\n\nAfter move to (3,5) with food: head to (3,5), body: (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), and new segment at (1,1), so tail at (1,1).\n\nNow, head at (3,5), direction R.\n\nFrom here, can move to other food, like (5,5).\n\n(5,5) is at x=5,y=5, internal obstacle at (5,6), which is above, but (5,5) should be free.\n\nTo reach (5,5), from (3,5), move R to (4,5), then to (5,5).\n\nBut need to check if (4,5) and (5,5) are free.\n\nCurrently, no snake there.\n\nAlso, life span of (5,5) is 10, so plenty of time.\n\nBut in this path, we didn't eat (1,6), which disappears at turn 14.\n\nIn the first path, we ate (1,6) on turn 12, then (3,5) on turn 14 or so.\n\nIn the first path: after eating (1,6) on turn 12, then on turn 13 moved to (2,6), then turn 14 to (2,5), then turn 15 to (3,5) to eat, but at turn 14 we are at (2,5), then to (3,5) on turn 15.\n\n(3,5) life span 7 at turn 10, so at turn 15, life span 7 - 5 = 2? Life span decreases each turn.\n\nAt turn 10, life span 7, so at turn 11, life span 6, turn 12:5, turn 13:4, turn 14:3, turn 15:2, turn 16:1, turn 17:0, gone at turn 17? Since it disappears after N turns, present from turn 10 to turn 10+7-1? Let's clarify.\n\nLife span N at turn t means: at turn t, countdown N, after turn t, countdown N-1 at turn t+1, ..., at turn t + N -1, countdown 1, at turn t+N, countdown 0, disappeared.\n\nSo for (3,5): at turn 10, life span 7, so present at turns 10,11,12,13,14,15,16; gone at turn 17.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6): life span 4 at turn 10, present turns 10,11,12,13; gone at turn 14.\n\n(5,5): life span 10, present turns 10 to 19, gone at 20.\n\nIn first path, eat (1,6) on turn 12, which is within time.\n\nThen at turn 15, can eat (3,5) if we reach.\n\nIn second path, eat (3,5) on turn 13, earlier.\n\nBut in second path, we didn't eat (1,6), which is wasted.\n\nSo better to eat both if possible.\n\nFirst path: turn 10: U to (1,4), turn 11: U to (1,5), turn 12: U to (1,6) eat, turn 13: R to (2,6), turn 14: D to (2,5) or R to (3,6), say D to (2,5), then turn 15: R to (3,5) eat.\n\nFrom (2,5) to (3,5) is R, so at turn 15 eat (3,5).\n\nThen after that, go to (5,5).\n\nNow, from (3,5), after eating, head at (3,5), direction R, can move R to (4,5), then to (5,5).\n\nBut (5,5) has obstacle at (5,6), but (5,5) should be ok.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,6), so (5,5) is free.\n\nMove to (4,5) on turn 16, then to (5,5) on turn 17 to eat.\n\nAt turn 17, (5,5) life span: at turn 10, 10, turn 17 is turn 10 +7, life span decreased to 10-7=3 at turn 17? At turn t, life span L, at turn t+k, life span L-k.\n\nAt turn 10, L=10, so at turn 17, k=7, L-k=3, so still present, yes.\n\nEat on turn 17.\n\nIn second path: turn 10: R to (2,3), turn 11: U to (2,4), turn 12: U to (2,5), turn 13: R to (3,5) eat, then turn 14: from (3,5) can move to (4,5), turn 15 to (5,5) eat, earlier.\n\nBut missed (1,6).\n\n(1,6) is eaten in first path, not in second.\n\nFirst path eats two food, second only one, so better to go for first path.\n\nBut in first path, after eating (1,6), we are at (1,6) near wall, but we can move out.\n\nAnother thing: Tail Reward Danger.\n\nIn the eating of (1,6), no issue.\n\nBut later, when eating (3,5), head at (3,5), tail at that time.\n\nIn first path, when eating (3,5) on turn 15, where is tail?\n\nAt turn 15, after moving to (3,5) to eat.\n\nBefore that, at turn 14, after move to (2,5): positions.\n\nLet's trace positions for first path.\n\nTurn 10: move U to (1,4)\n\nPositions: head (1,4), body (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1)  // tail at (2,1)\n\nTurn 11: move U to (1,5)\n\nPositions: head (1,5), body (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1)  // tail (1,1)\n\nTurn 12: move U to (1,6) eat, grow\n\nPositions: head (1,6), body (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), tail (1,1)  // new tail at (1,1), length 6\n\nTurn 13: move R to (2,6)\n\nNo food, so move only: head to (2,6), body: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)  // tail (1,2)? After move: new head (2,6), segment1 to (1,6), seg2 to (1,5), seg3 to (1,4), seg4 to (1,3), seg5 to (1,2). Old tail (1,1) removed, so tail at (1,2)\n\nPositions: [(2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]\n\nTail at (1,2)\n\nTurn 14: move D to (2,5)  // direction was R, now moving D, which is not opposite? Current direction after turn 13 move to (2,6) is R (right), opposite is L (left), D is down, not opposite, so allowed.\n\nMove to (2,5): new head (2,5), body: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)  // tail (1,3)? After move: head (2,5), seg1 to (2,6), seg2 to (1,6), seg3 to (1,5), seg4 to (1,4), seg5 to (1,3). Old tail (1,2) removed, so positions: [(2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)] tail at (1,3)\n\n(2,5) has no food, so no grow.\n\nNow, (3,5) is at (3,5), adjacent right.\n\nTurn 15: move R to (3,5) to eat.\n\nNow, (3,5) has food, positive, so eat.\n\nBefore move, head at (2,5), tail at (1,3). Are they adjacent? (2,5) and (1,3): dx=1, dy=2, not adjacent; adjacent would be same x or y, diff 1, like (2,5) and (1,5) or (2,4), etc. So not adjacent, so no Tail Reward Danger.\n\nMove to (3,5): head to (3,5), and grow, so positions: head (3,5), then body (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), and new segment at tail position (1,3), so tail at (1,3).\n\nNow, direction R.\n\nFrom (3,5), can move R to (4,5), or U to (3,6), or D to (3,4), etc.\n\nThen to (5,5).\n\nSimilarly, can eat (5,5) later.\n\nNow, but we have internal obstacle at (5,6), which might affect moving to (5,5).\n\n(5,5) is at (5,5), (5,6) is wall above, but (5,5) is free.\n\nFrom (3,5), move R to (4,5) on turn 16, then R to (5,5) on turn 17 to eat.\n\nAll good.\n\nIn the alternative, if we went right first, we eat (3,5) earlier but miss (1,6).\n\nSo first path is better, eat two food.\n\nBut is there a way to eat all three? (5,5) is far, but we can go after.\n\nNow, back to turn 10: if I move U, I can eat (1,6) and then (3,5).\n\nIf I move R, I eat (3,5) earlier but miss (1,6).\n\nSo moving U is better.\n\nBut when I move U at turn 10, I have to commit to going up.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (1,6) might be under body? But currently, snake is at y=1,2,3, food at y=6, not under body.\n\nAnd it can be eaten when head moves there.\n\nAlso, Tail Reward Danger only if adjacent and food on tail.\n\nIn this case, not.\n\nSo moving U at turn 10 seems good.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nTurn 10: action U\n\nThen turn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U to eat\n\nThen turn 13: R\n\nThen turn 14: D to (2,5)\n\nThen turn 15: R to (3,5) eat\n\nBut I need to output multiple turns, say 5 turns or so.\n\nThe answer should start from turn 10.\n\nAlso, for long-term, after that, go to (5,5).\n\nBut I think for the sequence, I can plan the first few moves.\n\nBut the user says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should consider up to turn 15 or more.\n\nIn the sequence above, from turn 10 to 15.\n\nNow, at turn 10, only two choices: U or R, since L invalid, D not allowed.\n\nR might be safer in terms of not going to corner.\n\nBut with U, I get an extra food.\n\nMoreover, the life span of (1,6) is short, so if I don't eat it now, I might not get another chance.\n\nFor example, if I go right, to (2,3), then I can go up to (2,4), but to reach (1,6), I need to go left, but from (2,4), moving L to (1,4) might be possible, but at turn 11 or 12, (1,6) life span decreases.\n\nSuppose turn 10: move R to (2,3)\n\nTurn 11: move U to (2,4)\n\nTurn 12: move U to (2,5)\n\nNow at (2,5), (1,6) is at (1,6), which is adjacent left and up? (2,5) to (1,6) is not adjacent; adjacent cells are (1,5), (2,6), (3,5), (2,4).\n\nTo reach (1,6) from (2,5), I need to move L to (1,5) first, then U to (1,6).\n\nBut at turn 12, (1,6) life span at turn 10 is 4, so at turn 12, life span 2 (since decreased by 2), so present, but at turn 13, life span 1, still present.\n\nTurn 12: at (2,5), can move L to (1,5) or U to (2,6), etc.\n\nIf move L to (1,5) on turn 12.\n\nThen positions: from turn 11, after move to (2,4), positions head (2,4), body (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) // tail (1,1)\n\nTurn 12: move L to (1,5)? From (2,4) to (1,5) is not adjacent; adjacent cells: (2,4) to (1,4) left, (2,5) up, (3,4) right, (2,3) down, but (2,3) is body.\n\n(1,5) is not adjacent to (2,4); it's diagonal? No, Manhattan adjacent: (1,5) is left and up, not directly adjacent; directly adjacent are same row or column, diff 1.\n\nFrom (2,4), adjacent: (1,4) left, (2,5) up, (3,4) right, (2,3) down.\n\n(1,5) is not adjacent; to reach (1,5), need to go to (1,4) or (2,5) first.\n\nFrom (2,4), if I move U to (2,5), then from (2,5) to (1,5) is L.\n\nBut (1,5) might be free.\n\nAt turn 12: if at (2,4), move U to (2,5), then positions head (2,5), body (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2) // tail (1,2)? After move: head (2,5), seg1 (2,4), seg2 (2,3), seg3 (1,3), seg4 (1,2), tail (1,1) removed, so positions [(2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2)] tail at (1,2)\n\nThen turn 13: from (2,5), move L to (1,5)\n\n(1,5) should be free, no snake.\n\nMove to (1,5): new head (1,5), body (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3) // tail (1,3)? After move: head (1,5), seg1 (2,5), seg2 (2,4), seg3 (2,3), seg4 (1,3). Old tail (1,2) removed, so positions [(1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3)] tail at (1,3)\n\nNow, (1,6) is above, at turn 13, life span 1, still present? At turn 10, life span 4, turn 13: 4 - 3 =1, yes present.\n\nTurn 14: move U to (1,6) to eat.\n\nBut at turn 14, (1,6) life span: at turn 13, countdown 1, so at turn 14, if we move there, it might be gone or not?\n\nLife span: at turn t, if countdown L, it is present during the turn, and can be eaten if head moves there.\n\nAfter the move, countdown decreases.\n\nIf head moves to food cell on turn t, it eats it, then countdown decreases, but since eaten, it disappears.\n\nAt turn 13, (1,6) has countdown 1, so it is present.\n\nOn turn 14, if head moves to (1,6), it eats it, then the food is consumed.\n\nAfter that, countdown would decrease to 0, but since eaten, it's gone anyway.\n\nSo yes, can eat on turn 14.\n\nBut turn 14 is the last turn it exists, since gone at turn 14 if not eaten? Disappears after N turns, at turn t + L.\n\nt=10, L=4, disappears at turn 14, meaning before turn 14 or after?\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo at turn 10, countdown 4, present.\n\nTurn 11, countdown 3, present.\n\n...\n\nTurn 13, countdown 1, present.\n\nTurn 14, countdown 0, not present; disappeared.\n\nSo to eat, must be on or before turn 13.\n\nAt turn 14, it is gone.\n\nTherefore, in this path, if I try to reach (1,6) from the right, I can eat at turn 14, but at turn 14, it is not present anymore, since countdown 0.\n\nThus, I cannot eat (1,6) if I go this way; I must eat by turn 13.\n\nIn the sequence above, on turn 14, I move to (1,6), but it is gone.\n\nTherefore, the only way to eat (1,6) is to go directly up from turn 10, eating on turn 12.\n\nIf I go right first, I cannot reach (1,6) in time to eat it, because turn 13 is the last chance, and from (2,3) or (2,4), I need multiple moves to reach (1,6), but from (2,4), to (1,4) or (2,5), then to (1,5), then to (1,6), which takes to turn 13 at earliest if I go directly, but let's see.\n\nFrom turn 10: (1,3) move R to (2,3) turn 10\n\nTurn 11: move to (2,4) U\n\nTurn 12: move to (1,4) L? But from (2,4), move L to (1,4)\n\nThen turn 13: move U to (1,5)\n\nBut (1,6) is at (1,6), not reached yet; need another move to (1,6) on turn 14, but turn 14 not present.\n\nFrom (2,4) turn 12, move U to (2,5), then turn 13 move L to (1,5), then turn 14 to (1,6) but gone.\n\nCannot reach (1,6) by turn 13 if I start by moving right.\n\nTherefore, to eat (1,6), I must move up at turn 10.\n\nThus, the best is to move U at turn 10.\n\nThen proceed as before.\n\nFor the answer, I need to output actions for several turns.\n\nSince thinking ahead, I can output a sequence.\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U (to (1,5))\n\nTurn 12: U (to (1,6) eat)\n\nThen turn 13: since at (1,6), direction U, but U invalid, so must move R to (2,6)\n\nTurn 14: from (2,6), direction R, can move D to (2,5) or R to (3,6), etc. Moving D to (2,5) to go towards (3,5)\n\nThen turn 15: R to (3,5) eat.\n\nBut I need to specify actions.\n\nIn the sequence, after turn 12, I have to move R on turn 13.\n\nFor turn 14, I can choose to move D to (2,5).\n\nNow, after that, to (3,5).\n\nBut for the output, perhaps list 5 actions or so.\n\nThe answer format says to list actions for multiple turns, but not specified how many. I think for the immediate actions.\n\nSince it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide actions for 5 turns or more.\n\nLet's see the state: current turn t1=10.\n\nSo output actions for turn 10,11,12,13,14, etc.\n\nBut I need to decide.\n\nPerhaps I can output the sequence I have.\n\nBut at turn 14, from (2,6), I could move R to (3,6) instead of D, but (3,6) is near (5,6) obstacle, but (3,6) is free.\n\nBut moving to (3,6) then down to (3,5) to eat, which might be similar.\n\nBut (3,5) is at y=5, so from (3,6) move D to (3,5).\n\nBut in terms of steps, it might take the same or more.\n\nFrom (2,6) move R to (3,6) turn 14, then turn 15 move D to (3,5) to eat, same as before but one turn later for eating (3,5).\n\nPreviously from (2,6) move D to (2,5) turn 14, then turn 15 move R to (3,5) eat.\n\nIf move to (3,6) turn 14, then to (3,5) turn 15, same.\n\nBut from (2,5) to (3,5) is direct, whereas (3,6) to (3,5) is down.\n\nBut (3,5) might be occupied? No.\n\nBut in both cases, eat on turn 15.\n\nBut moving to (2,5) first might be better because it's closer to (5,5) later, but not significant.\n\nSo I think moving D to (2,5) on turn 14 is fine.\n\nThen for turn 15, move R to (3,5) to eat.\n\nAfter that, continue.\n\nBut for the answer, since the state is given, I think providing actions up to turn 14 or 15 is ok.\n\nNow, to confirm, is there any risk in moving up?\n\nFor example, at turn 11, when at (1,4), is there danger?\n\n(1,4) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) free.\n\nAnd after eating, moving right.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (5,6), but not relevant now.\n\nAlso, walls, all fine.\n\nSo I think moving U at turn 10 is the best.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U (eat food at (1,6))\n\nNow for turn 13: from (1,6), must move R to (2,6), since only possible move.\n\nThen turn 14: from (2,6), direction R, can move D to (2,5) or R to (3,6) or U, but U invalid.\n\nI think moving D to (2,5) is better to target (3,5).\n\nThen turn 15: move R to (3,5) to eat.\n\nBut I need to output only the actions, not the reasons.\n\nIn the answer format, just list the actions.\n\nBut how many turns? Since it says \"etc.\", I can list for several turns.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns: turn 10 to 14.\n\nTurn 10,11,12,13,14.\n\nActions: U, U, U, R, D\n\nThen for turn 15, R, but not included.\n\nBut thinking ahead, it should be fine.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nAnother consideration: when moving to (1,6) on turn 12, and eating, then at turn 13 moving to (2,6), all safe.\n\nSimilarly, no immediate risks.\n\nTherefore, I think this is the plan.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, I will plan a sequence of moves that prioritizes eating the positive food at (1,6) due to its short remaining life span (must be eaten by turn 13). This food is reachable in 3 moves from the current position. After eating it, I will navigate toward the food at (3,5) to eat it by turn 15, and then proceed toward (5,5) for future turns. The path avoids walls, obstacles, and body collisions, and considers movement constraints (no instant reverse).\n\n### Key Considerations for the Plan:\n- **Food Priorities**: \n  - (1,6) has life span 4 (present until turn 13, disappears at turn 14). Eating it by turn 12 is efficient and adds +1 to score and length.\n  - (3,5) has life span 7 (present until turn 16), so it can be targeted after (1,6).\n  - (5,5) has life span 10 (present until turn 19), allowing more time to reach it.\n- **Current Position and Constraints**: \n  - Head at (1,3) with direction U. Possible moves: U or R (L to (0,3) is wall, D is reverse and not allowed).\n  - Moving U immediately is optimal to reach (1,6) quickly. Delaying risks missing this food.\n- **Risks Avoided**:\n  - After eating (1,6) at turn 12, the head is at (1,6) near the top wall (y=7). Moving R on turn 13 avoids the wall and body collisions.\n  - Tail Reward Danger: When eating (1,6) and (3,5), the head is not adjacent to the tail, so no risk.\n  - Internal obstacle at (5,6) is irrelevant for the first 5+ turns but will be considered later when targeting (5,5).\n- **Path Efficiency**: \n  - Eating (1,6) on turn 12 requires moves: turn 10 U, turn 11 U, turn 12 U.\n  - After eating, move R on turn 13 to (2,6), then D on turn 14 to (2,5) to set up for (3,5).\n  - On turn 15, move R to (3,5) to eat, then proceed to (5,5) in later turns.\n- **Long-term Survival**: \n  - The plan avoids trapping the snake in corners. After turn 14, the snake can freely navigate to (5,5) and other areas.\n  - Simulated positions (see below) confirm no body/wall collisions for 5+ turns.\n\n### Simulated Positions (for validation):\n- **Turn 10 (start)**: Snake positions: [(1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1)]; head direction U.\n- **After Turn 10 (U to (1,4))**: Positions: [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1)]; head direction U.\n- **After Turn 11 (U to (1,5))**: Positions: [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1)]; head direction U.\n- **After Turn 12 (U to (1,6))**: Eat food at (1,6); grow to length 6. Positions: [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1)]; head direction U.\n- **After Turn 13 (R to (2,6))**: Positions: [(2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]; head direction R.\n- **After Turn 14 (D to (2,5))**: Positions: [(2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)]; head direction D (since moved down, but direction updates to D).\n- **Turn 15 (R to (3,5))**: Eat food at (3,5); grow to length 7. Positions: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)]; head direction R.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence for turns 10 to 14 ensures eating (1,6) and positions the snake to eat (3,5) on turn 15. Moves beyond turn 14 (e.g., to (5,5)) are planned but not listed here for brevity.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 10: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 11: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 12: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 13: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 14: D (down)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 11.\n\nThe grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nSnake positions: head at (1,4), then body segments at (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), and tail at (2,1). So the snake is 5 segments long. Head direction is Up, meaning it was moving upwards last turn.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (1,6) with life span 3 and value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (3,5) with life span 6 and value 1 (positive)\n\n- (5,5) with life span 9 and value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food here.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score and avoid risks.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid to visualize:\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders, so cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Internal wall at (5,6).\n\nSnake: head (1,4), body (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), tail (2,1). So the snake is mostly vertical at x=1, from y=1 to y=4, but tail at (2,1), so it's like it turned at (2,1) to (1,1).\n\nHead is at (1,4), moving Up. Last move was Up, so from (1,3) to (1,4)? Positions are head first: [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1)]. So head is at (1,4), and it moved to (1,4) from (1,3) since direction is Up. So previous position was (1,3), now head at (1,4).\n\nSince direction is Up, it cannot move Down next turn because of no instant reverse rule. So possible moves from (1,4): Up, Left, Right. Down is opposite to current direction, so not allowed.\n\nCurrent head position: (1,4)\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Up: to (1,5)\n\n- Down: not allowed, since current direction is Up\n\n- Left: to (0,4) but x=0 is wall, so cannot move Left\n\n- Right: to (2,4)\n\nx=0 is wall, so Left is invalid.\n\nDown is invalid due to direction.\n\nSo only possible moves are Up or Right.\n\nUp to (1,5) or Right to (2,4).\n\nNow, check if these cells are occupied by body or walls.\n\n(1,5): is there body? Snake positions: (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1). So (1,5) is free? Let's list all occupied cells: (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1). So (1,5) is empty, not wall or body. Walls are at borders and (5,6), so (1,5) should be fine.\n\n(2,4): empty? Not in snake positions, not wall. Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (5,6). (2,4) is within bounds, not wall, not body, so fine.\n\nNow, food locations:\n\n- (1,6): life span 3, value 1\n\n- (3,5): life span 6, value 1\n\n- (5,5): life span 9, value 1\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current turn. Current turn is t=11, so after this turn, life spans decrease.\n\nThe state is given at turn t1=11, and I need to output actions starting from turn t1.\n\nIn the answer, it should be Turn 11: action, Turn 12: action, etc.\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nFirst, consider moving Up or Right from (1,4).\n\nIf I move Up to (1,5), then head is at (1,5). Then next turn, from there.\n\nIf I move Right to (2,4), head at (2,4).\n\nNow, food at (1,6) is close. (1,5) is one step away from (1,6). If I go to (1,5) now, then next turn I could go to (1,6) to eat it.\n\nBut I need to check the life span. Current life span for (1,6) is 3. After this turn (t=11), it decreases to 2. If I move to (1,5) on turn 11, then on turn 12, if I move to (1,6), I can eat it, and life span would be 1 when I eat it? Life span decreases at the end of each turn, I think.\n\nThe rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at the start of turn t, life span is given. After the turn, it decreases.\n\nFor food at (1,6): at turn 11, life span=3. After turn 11 action, it decreases to 2. Then after turn 12, to 1, and so on.\n\nIf I move to (1,6) on turn 12, I eat it when life span is 2? When I move onto the cell, I eat it during that turn.\n\nThe rule: \"the head moves onto the food cell\" during a turn.\n\nSo when head moves to a food cell in a turn, it is eaten that turn.\n\nLife span decreases after the turn, I believe. Let me read.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nIt says countdown decreases every turn including current, so at the end of the turn, I think.\n\nBut when I move onto it, if the food is present, I eat it.\n\nFor example, at turn t, food has life span L. After the turn, it decreases to L-1.\n\nIf head moves to it during turn t, it eats it, and then the food is gone, so no decrease.\n\nSimilarly, if life span was 1, and head moves to it, eats it; if not, after the turn it disappears.\n\nIn this case, for (1,6) at turn 11, life span=3.\n\nIf I move to (1,6) on turn 11, I can eat it immediately? But from (1,4), I can only go to (1,5) or (2,4), not directly to (1,6) in one move.\n\n(1,4) to (1,6) is two cells away, not adjacent. Moves are to adjacent cells.\n\nSo to reach (1,6), I need two moves: first to (1,5), then to (1,6).\n\nTurn 11: from (1,4), move to (1,5) or (2,4).\n\nIf I move to (1,5) on turn 11, then head at (1,5). After turn 11, food (1,6) life span decreases to 2.\n\nTurn 12: from (1,5), I can move to (1,6) to eat it, and at that point, life span is 2, but since I eat it, it's fine.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows by one segment.\n\nSimilarly, other food.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nAlso, there's a danger with tail.\n\nCurrent tail is at (2,1). After moving, the tail moves forward when snake moves, unless it eats food.\n\nWhen snake eats food, it grows, so tail stays in place for that turn, but since it grows, the new tail is added, so the segment that was tail remains.\n\nStandard snake mechanics: when no food eaten, head moves to new cell, tail moves away from its position. When food eaten, head moves to food cell, tail does not move, so snake grows by one.\n\nIn terms of positions: if no eat, positions: new head, then body except tail removed? No.\n\nSnake positions: list of coordinates, head first.\n\nWhen moving without eating, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so the last segment (tail) is removed.\n\nWhen eating, head moves to food, new head position, body segments move to previous positions, but tail stays, so a new segment is added at the tail end.\n\nIn this case, since we eat food, the tail doesn't move.\n\nNow, about tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut tail cell: the current tail position.\n\nIn this state, tail is at (2,1). Is there food on (2,1)? Food locations are (1,6), (3,5), (5,5), none at (2,1), so no issue now.\n\nBut after moves, it might be.\n\nBack to decision.\n\nOptions at turn 11:\n\nMove Up to (1,5) or Right to (2,4).\n\nFirst, consider moving Up to (1,5).\n\nThen turn 11: move U to (1,5)\n\nSnake new positions: head at (1,5), then previous head (1,4) becomes body, so [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1)]? No.\n\nAfter move, if no food eaten, head moves to new cell, and tail moves forward.\n\nCurrent positions: head (1,4), body (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), tail (2,1)\n\nIf move U to (1,5), no food there, so new head (1,5), then body segments: (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), and (1,1) moves to where? The segment that was at (1,1) moves to the position of the next, but (1,1) is followed by (2,1)? The list is ordered: positions[0] head, positions[1] next, etc.\n\nWhen moving: new head position = (1,5) for U move.\n\nThen the body segments: the first body segment (index 1) moves to the old head position (1,4), index 2 moves to old index 1 position (1,3), index 3 moves to old index 2 position (1,2), and the tail (index 4) moves to old index 3 position (1,1). But old index 3 is (1,2)? Let's index.\n\nPositions: index 0: (1,4) head\n\nIndex 1: (1,3)\n\nIndex 2: (1,2)\n\nIndex 3: (1,1)\n\nIndex 4: (2,1) tail\n\nAfter move U to (1,5), new head at (1,5)\n\nNew body:\n\n- Segment that was index 0 is now at (1,5)\n\n- Segment that was index 1 moves to where index 0 was, (1,4)\n\n- Segment that was index 2 moves to where index 1 was, (1,3)\n\n- Segment that was index 3 moves to where index 2 was, (1,2)\n\n- Segment that was index 4 (tail) moves to where index 3 was, (1,1)\n\nSo new positions: [(1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1)]\n\nTail is now at (1,1), and (2,1) is vacated.\n\nNo food at (1,5), so no growth.\n\nFood life spans decrease: (1,6) from 3 to 2, (3,5) from 6 to 5, (5,5) from 9 to 8.\n\nTurn 12: head at (1,5), direction was U, but after move, direction is now U, since we moved U.\n\nHead direction is the direction of the last move. After moving U, head direction is U.\n\nFrom (1,5), possible moves: U to (1,6), D to (1,4) but (1,4) is now body, and D is opposite to current direction U, so cannot move D.\n\nL to (0,5) but x=0 wall, invalid.\n\nR to (2,5)\n\nSo only U or R.\n\n(2,5) is empty? Not wall, not body. Body positions: (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1). So (2,5) free.\n\nFood at (1,6) has life span 2 now? After turn 11, it decreased to 2.\n\nTurn 12: if move U to (1,6), which has food, so eat it.\n\nThen snake grows: head moves to (1,6), eats food, so tail does not move. New positions: head (1,6), then body (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), and tail (1,1) remains? After eating, the tail stays, so new segment at old tail position.\n\nOld positions before move: head (1,5), body (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), tail (1,1)\n\nMove head to (1,6), which has food, so new head (1,6), then body segments: (1,5) from old head, (1,4) from old index1, (1,3) from old index2, (1,2) from old index3, and the tail (1,1) does not move, so it stays, and since we eat, a new segment is added, but the tail position remains, and the body is extended.\n\nNew positions: head (1,6), then (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), and tail still (1,1) — but (1,1) was tail, now it's part of body, and since we ate, a new tail is added? No.\n\nWhen eating, the head moves to new position, and all body segments shift to the next position, but the tail segment remains in place because we don't remove it; we add a new segment at the end.\n\nStandard: positions list.\n\nBefore move: [ (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) ]  head (1,5), tail (1,1)\n\nAfter moving to (1,6) and eating:\n\nNew head: (1,6)\n\nThen the body: the first body segment is the old head position (1,5), second is old first body (1,4), third old second body (1,3), fourth old third body (1,2), and the old tail (1,1) becomes the new second last, and since we eat, we add a new segment at the position where the tail was, but tail was at (1,1), and it doesn't move, so new segment is added at (1,1)? I'm confusing myself.\n\nTypically: after eating, the snake grows, so the new position list is: [new_head, old_head, old_body1, old_body2, ..., old_tail]\n\nSo for example, old: [A, B, C, D] with A head, D tail.\n\nMove to new cell E, if no food, new positions: [E, A, B, C] , D removed.\n\nIf E has food, new positions: [E, A, B, C, D] , so D remains, snake longer.\n\nIn this case:\n\nBefore turn 12 move: positions [ (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) ] head (1,5), tail (1,1)\n\nMove to (1,6) and eat food: new positions [ (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) ] so now 6 segments, tail at (1,1)\n\nFood (1,6) is eaten, so removed.\n\nLife spans: after turn 12, food (3,5) life span 5 (was 6, decreased after turn 11 to 5? Let's track.\n\nTurn 11 start: food (1,6) life 3, (3,5) life 6, (5,5) life 9\n\nAfter turn 11 action (say move U to (1,5), no eat), food (1,6) life decreases to 2, (3,5) to 5, (5,5) to 8.\n\nTurn 12: move U to (1,6), eat food, so (1,6) is eaten and removed. Other food: (3,5) life 5, after turn decreases to 4; similarly (5,5) to 7.\n\nBut (1,6) is gone.\n\nNow, snake at [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1)] head at (1,6), direction U.\n\nFrom here, possible moves: U to (1,7), but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n\nD to (1,5), but (1,5) is body, and D is opposite to U? Current direction U, move D is reverse, not allowed.\n\nL to (0,6) x=0 wall, invalid.\n\nR to (2,6)\n\n(2,6) is empty? Not wall, not body. Body: x=1 y from 1 to 6, and (2,6) free.\n\nSo only R to (2,6) possible.\n\nTurn 13: move R to (2,6)\n\nNo food there, so new positions: head (2,6), then body (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) — tail (1,1) moves to old position of (1,2)? After move no eat.\n\nOld positions: head (1,6), body (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), tail (1,1)\n\nMove to (2,6), no food, so new head (2,6), new body: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), and tail moves to (1,2) — old index 4 (tail) moves to old index 3 position? Indices: old index 0: (1,6), index1: (1,5), index2: (1,4), index3: (1,3), index4: (1,2), index5: (1,1) tail? Since we ate, 6 segments.\n\nPositions: index0 head (1,6), index1 (1,5), index2 (1,4), index3 (1,3), index4 (1,2), index5 (1,1) tail\n\nAfter move to (2,6) no eat: new head (2,6)\n\nThen index1 moves to old index0 (1,6)\n\nIndex2 moves to old index1 (1,5)\n\nIndex3 moves to old index2 (1,4)\n\nIndex4 moves to old index3 (1,3)\n\nIndex5 (tail) moves to old index4 (1,2)\n\nSo new positions: [(2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)] tail at (1,2)\n\n(1,1) vacated.\n\nNow head at (2,6), last move R, so direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,7) y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nD to (2,5)\n\nL to (1,6) but (1,6) is body, collision.\n\nR to (3,6)\n\n(2,5) and (3,6) possible? (2,5) is empty? Not body, not wall. Body: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) so (2,5) free.\n\n(3,6) free.\n\nBut D: moving down, current direction R, not opposite, so D is allowed? Opposite to R is L, not D. Directions: U and D opposite, L and R opposite.\n\nCurrent direction R, so cannot move L, but can move U, D, R.\n\nU to (2,7) invalid, D to (2,5), R to (3,6).\n\nL to (1,6) is body, invalid.\n\nSo possible D to (2,5) or R to (3,6).\n\nNow, food at (3,5) is at (3,5), which is below and left of (2,6).\n\nIf I go to (2,5) on turn 13, then from there I can go to (3,5) or other.\n\nBut let's not get too deep yet.\n\nThis is if I went Up on turn 11.\n\nBut I have another choice at turn 11: move Right to (2,4).\n\nLet's explore that.\n\nTurn 11: move R to (2,4)\n\nFrom (1,4) to (2,4), no food, so new positions: head (2,4), then body (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), and tail moves to old index3 position? Old positions: head (1,4), index1 (1,3), index2 (1,2), index3 (1,1), index4 (2,1) tail\n\nAfter move to (2,4) no eat: new head (2,4)\n\nIndex1 moves to old head (1,4)\n\nIndex2 moves to old index1 (1,3)\n\nIndex3 moves to old index2 (1,2)\n\nIndex4 (tail) moves to old index3 (1,1)\n\nSo new positions: [(2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1)] tail at (1,1)\n\n(2,1) vacated.\n\nHead at (2,4), last move R, so direction R.\n\nFood: (1,6) life span after decrease to 2, (3,5) to 5, (5,5) to 8.\n\nNow turn 12: from (2,4), possible moves.\n\nCurrent direction R, so cannot move L (opposite).\n\nU to (2,5)\n\nD to (2,3)\n\nR to (3,4)\n\nL to (1,4) but (1,4) is body, collision, invalid.\n\nSo possible U, D, R.\n\n(2,5): empty? Not body, not wall. Body: (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) so (2,5) free.\n\n(2,3): free? Not body, not wall.\n\n(3,4): free.\n\nFood at (3,5) is at (3,5), which is up-right from (2,4).\n\nIf I move U to (2,5), then I'm closer to (3,5).\n\nOr directly to (3,4), then to (3,5) next.\n\nBut (3,5) has food, life span 5 after turn 11.\n\nAlso, there is food at (1,6) with shorter life span, but it's at (1,6), which is left and up, but from (2,4), to reach (1,6) I need to go left and up, but left to (1,4) is body, blocked, so I cannot go directly to (1,6) from here. To reach (1,6), I would need to go around, but it might expire soon.\n\n(1,6) life span 2 after turn 11, so it will disappear after turn 12 if not eaten.\n\nAfter turn 12, it decreases to 1, then after turn 13 to 0 and disappears.\n\nSo if not eaten by turn 12, it's gone.\n\nAt turn 12, if I am at (2,4), I can move to (2,5), (2,3), or (3,4), none of which is (1,6), so I cannot eat (1,6) on turn 12.\n\nOnly if I were at (1,5) on turn 12, I could eat it.\n\nBut if I moved Right on turn 11, I'm at (2,4) on turn 12, not at (1,5).\n\nSo (1,6) will expire if not eaten soon.\n\nIf I don't go for it, it will be gone.\n\nNow, value is +1, so it's good to eat if possible.\n\nBut let's think long-term.\n\nThere is also (3,5) with life span 6, now 5 after turn 11, and (5,5) with 9, now 8.\n\n(1,6) is about to expire, so if I can eat it, I should, but only if I go Up on turn 11.\n\nIf I go Right, I miss it.\n\nBut going Up might lead to a dead end, as I saw earlier, after eating (1,6), I had to go Right to (2,6), then from there, on turn 13, I can go to (2,5) or (3,6).\n\nIf I go to (2,5), then head at (2,5), direction from (2,6) to (2,5) is Down, so direction D.\n\nThen from (2,5), possible moves: U to (2,6) but (2,6) is body, and U is opposite to D? Current direction D, U is opposite, not allowed.\n\nD to (2,4) , but what is there?\n\nPositions at that point: after turn 13 move to (2,5), let's not assume.\n\nFrom earlier: after turn 12, if I ate (1,6), positions at start of turn 13: head (2,6), body (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), tail (1,2)? Earlier I had after move to (2,6) no eat: positions [(2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]\n\nHead (2,6), direction R.\n\nTurn 13: if move D to (2,5), no food? (2,5) has no food, so new positions: head (2,5), then body (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) — tail moves to (1,2)? Old tail (1,2) moves to old index4 position.\n\nOld: index0 (2,6), index1 (1,6), index2 (1,5), index3 (1,4), index4 (1,3), index5 (1,2) tail\n\nAfter move to (2,5) no eat: new head (2,5)\n\nIndex1 to (2,6)\n\nIndex2 to (1,6)\n\nIndex3 to (1,5)\n\nIndex4 to (1,4)\n\nIndex5 to (1,3)  // new tail at (1,3)\n\nSo positions: [(2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)]\n\nHead at (2,5), last move D, so direction D.\n\nThen turn 14: possible moves.\n\nCurrent direction D, so cannot move U (opposite).\n\nL to (1,5) but (1,5) is body, invalid.\n\nR to (3,5) — (3,5) has food!\n\n(3,5) is food, value 1.\n\nD to (2,4) — empty? Not body, not wall.\n\nU not allowed.\n\nSo possible moves: R to (3,5) or D to (2,4)\n\nIf move R to (3,5), eat food.\n\nThen snake grows.\n\nBut let's see if there is tail danger.\n\nHead is at (2,5), tail is at (1,3), not adjacent. (2,5) adjacent cells: (2,4), (2,6), (1,5), (3,5). (1,5) is body, (2,6) is body, (2,4) empty, (3,5) food.\n\nTail at (1,3), not adjacent to head, so no danger.\n\nMove to (3,5) and eat.\n\nSimilarly, if I move D to (2,4), then from there I can go to (3,4) or other later.\n\nBut (3,5) might be eaten later, but life span is decreasing.\n\nIn this path, I can eat (3,5) on turn 14 if I choose.\n\nBut let's compare to if I moved Right on turn 11.\n\nI need to think about the internal wall at (5,6), but it's not immediately relevant.\n\nAlso, food at (5,5) with long life span.\n\nBut first, let's decide for turn 11.\n\nIf I go Up on turn 11, I can eat (1,6) on turn 12, then I am at (1,6), then to (2,6) on turn 13, then to (2,5) or (3,6) on turn 13.\n\nIf to (2,5) on turn 13, then on turn 14 I can eat (3,5) if I move R.\n\nSo in that case, I eat two foods: (1,6) and (3,5).\n\nIf on turn 13 I go to (3,6) instead of (2,5).\n\nFrom (2,6), move R to (3,6) on turn 13.\n\nNo food at (3,6), so new positions: head (3,6), then body (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) — tail moves.\n\nOld: head (2,6), body (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), tail (1,2)\n\nAfter move to (3,6) no eat: new head (3,6), index1 to (2,6), index2 to (1,6), index3 to (1,5), index4 to (1,4), index5 to (1,3)  // new tail (1,3)\n\nHead at (3,6), direction R.\n\nThen turn 14: possible moves.\n\nDirection R, cannot move L.\n\nU to (3,7) y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nD to (3,5) — (3,5) has food!\n\nL to (2,6) but (2,6) is body, invalid.\n\nR to (4,6)\n\nSo possible D to (3,5) or R to (4,6)\n\nIf D to (3,5), eat food.\n\nSimilarly, I can eat (3,5) on turn 14.\n\nIn both cases, if I go Up on turn 11, I eat (1,6) on turn 12, and then (3,5) on turn 14, with one move in between.\n\nNow, if I go Right on turn 11 to (2,4), then on turn 12, I can move to (2,5), (2,3), or (3,4).\n\nIf I move U to (2,5) on turn 12, no food, then head at (2,5), direction U.\n\nThen turn 13: from (2,5), current direction U, cannot move D.\n\nPossible: U to (2,6), L to (1,5), R to (3,5)\n\n(2,6) empty, (1,5) is body? Positions: after turn 12 move to (2,5), no eat.\n\nTurn 12: from (2,4) move U to (2,5), no food.\n\nOld positions turn 12 start: [(2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1)]\n\nAfter move to (2,5): new head (2,5), index1 to (2,4), index2 to (1,4), index3 to (1,3), index4 to (1,2)  // new tail (1,2)\n\nPositions: [(2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]\n\nHead (2,5), direction U.\n\nTurn 13: possible moves.\n\nCannot move D (opposite).\n\nU to (2,6) — empty\n\nL to (1,5) — empty? Not body, not wall. Body: (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) so (1,5) free.\n\nR to (3,5) — food\n\nAll possible.\n\nIf move R to (3,5), eat food on turn 13.\n\nThen snake grows.\n\nCompared to previous path, in Up-first path, I eat (1,6) on turn 12 and (3,5) on turn 14.\n\nIn this Right-first path, I eat (3,5) on turn 13 if I move directly, but I missed (1,6).\n\n(1,6) expires after turn 12 if not eaten.\n\nIn Right-first, on turn 12, I cannot eat (1,6), so it disappears.\n\nThen I can eat (3,5) on turn 13.\n\nSo in Up-first, I get two foods: (1,6) and (3,5), in about 3 turns.\n\nIn Right-first, I get only (3,5) but one turn earlier, but one less food.\n\nSince both +1, getting two is better than one.\n\nMoreover, after eating (3,5), I can go for (5,5).\n\nBut in Up-first, after eating (3,5) on turn 14, I can go towards (5,5).\n\nSimilarly in Right-first, after eating (3,5) on turn 13, I can go to (5,5).\n\nBut (5,5) has longer life span, so no rush.\n\nAlso, in Up-first, when I ate (1,6), I was at (1,6), then to (2,6), which is near the top, but I can go down.\n\nBut there is a wall at (5,6), internal obstacle.\n\n(5,6) is a wall, so I need to avoid it.\n\nBut it's not blocking yet.\n\nAnother thing: in the Up-first path, after eating (1,6) and going to (2,6), the snake is along x=1 from y=1 to 6, and (2,6), so it's a bit constrained, but I can move away.\n\nIn Right-first, from (2,4), I have more space.\n\nBut since I can eat an extra food, Up seems better for short term.\n\nBut let's confirm the tail danger or other risks.\n\nIn Up-first, when I eat (1,6) on turn 12, tail is at (1,1), head at (1,6), not adjacent.\n\nAfter moving to (2,6), head at (2,6), tail at (1,2), not adjacent.\n\nThen to (2,5) or (3,6), no issue.\n\nSimilarly, when eating (3,5), no tail issue.\n\nNow, for the third food (5,5), I need to go east.\n\nFrom (3,5) or wherever, I can go to (4,5), then (5,5).\n\n(5,5) life span 9, decreases slowly.\n\nBut there is internal wall at (5,6), which is above (5,5), so moving to (5,5) is fine, but if I go to (5,6), it's wall, invalid.\n\n(5,6) is wall, so I cannot go there.\n\nBut (5,5) is fine.\n\nTo reach (5,5) from current position.\n\nIf I go Up on turn 11, I can be at (3,5) by turn 14, as above.\n\nThen from (3,5), after eating, head at (3,5), direction, say if I came from (2,5) or (3,6), but in the path, when I eat (3,5), I come from above or left.\n\nFor example, in Up-first path: on turn 14, after moving to (3,5) from (2,5) or from (3,6).\n\nSuppose from (2,5) to (3,5) on turn 14, move R, direction R.\n\nEat food, so positions: old head (2,5), body (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), tail (1,3)\n\nAfter move to (3,5) and eat: new head (3,5), then (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), and tail (1,3) remains? New positions: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)] since growth.\n\nSnake length now 7.\n\nHead at (3,5), direction R.\n\nThen turn 15: possible moves.\n\nDirection R, cannot move L.\n\nU to (3,6) — empty? Not body, not wall.\n\nD to (3,4) — empty\n\nR to (4,5) — empty\n\nL invalid.\n\n(3,6) is free, (3,4) free, (4,5) free.\n\nI can move R to (4,5) to go towards (5,5).\n\nSimilarly, in other paths.\n\nNow, if I went Right on turn 11, I eat (3,5) earlier, but missed (1,6), so net one less point.\n\nUnless (1,6) is risky, but it doesn't seem.\n\nAnother point: when I move to (1,5) on turn 11, is there any risk?\n\n(1,5) is empty, no issue.\n\nBut food can spawn under body, but here no food under body.\n\nAlso, tail danger only if head adjacent to tail and food on tail, but not here.\n\nSo going Up to eat (1,6) seems beneficial.\n\nMoreover, after that, I have options.\n\nIf I go Right on turn 11, I miss (1,6), and I can still eat (3,5) and (5,5), but I have one less point.\n\nSince all food is +1, eating all three is best, but (1,6) expires soon, so I should eat it if possible.\n\nIn this case, by going Up, I can eat it.\n\nNow, for the action plan, I need to output multiple turns.\n\nBut I need to specify actions for turn 11, 12, 13, etc., at least 5 turns.\n\nBut the future depends on choices.\n\nI should decide the sequence.\n\nAlso, to maximize, I should go for the foods.\n\nAfter eating (1,6) and (3,5), go to (5,5).\n\n(5,5) life span 9, at turn 11, after decreases, but plenty of time.\n\nNow, internal wall at (5,6), so from (3,5), I can go to (4,5), then (5,5).\n\nBut (5,6) is wall, so I cannot go up from (5,5), but I can go down or other.\n\nBut let's outline the sequence.\n\nTurn 11: move U to (1,5)\n\nThen turn 12: move U to (1,6) to eat food.\n\nThen turn 13: from (1,6), only possible move R to (2,6) as earlier.\n\nThen turn 14: from (2,6), I can move D to (2,5) to get closer to (3,5)\n\nOr R to (3,6), but (3,5) is at (3,5), which is down from (3,6) or left from (2,5).\n\nIf I go to (2,5) on turn 14, then turn 15 move R to (3,5) to eat.\n\nIf I go to (3,6) on turn 14, then turn 15 move D to (3,5) to eat.\n\nEither way, I eat on turn 15 if I go to (2,5) on turn 14.\n\nLet's set the actions.\n\nFirst, turn 11: move U\n\nAfter move, positions: head (1,5), body (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) tail\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 12: move U to (1,6) eat food.\n\nNew positions: head (1,6), body (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) tail? After eating, positions: [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1)] 6 segments.\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 13: from (1,6), possible moves: U to (1,7) wall, invalid; D to (1,5) body and opposite, invalid; L to (0,6) wall; R to (2,6) only choice.\n\nMove R to (2,6)\n\nNo food, new positions: head (2,6), body (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) tail at (1,2)? Old tail (1,1) moved? After move no eat: old head (1,6), body (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), tail (1,1)\n\nMove to (2,6): new head (2,6), index1 to (1,6), index2 to (1,5), index3 to (1,4), index4 to (1,3), index5 to (1,2)  // new tail (1,2)\n\nPositions: [(2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 14: from (2,6), possible moves: U to (2,7) wall; D to (2,5); L to (1,6) body; R to (3,6)\n\nSo D or R.\n\nI should go towards (3,5). (3,5) is at (3,5), which is down and right from (2,6).\n\n(2,5) is directly below, then to (3,5).\n\n(3,6) is right, then down to (3,5).\n\nMoving to (2,5) might be better because it's closer to the food.\n\n(2,5) to (3,5) is adjacent right.\n\n(3,6) to (3,5) is down.\n\nBut in terms of turns, both take the same number of moves to reach (3,5) from here.\n\nFrom (2,6), if I go D to (2,5) on turn 14, then on turn 15 I can go R to (3,5) to eat.\n\nIf I go R to (3,6) on turn 14, then on turn 15 I can go D to (3,5) to eat.\n\nSo eating on turn 15 in both cases.\n\nBut after eating, I need to go to (5,5).\n\nIf I am at (2,5) on turn 14, then to (3,5) on turn 15, eat.\n\nThen head at (3,5), direction from (2,5) to (3,5) is R.\n\nThen I can go R to (4,5) on turn 16, then to (5,5) on turn 17.\n\nIf I go to (3,6) on turn 14, then to (3,5) on turn 15, eat, then from (3,5) I can go R to (4,5) on turn 16, same.\n\nBut when I eat at (3,5) from (3,6), moving down, direction D.\n\nThen from (3,5), I can still go R to (4,5).\n\nNo big difference.\n\nBut to save a move or something, but not necessary.\n\nI think moving to (2,5) on turn 14 is fine.\n\nNow, about the internal wall: (5,6) is wall, so from (4,5), to (5,5), fine.\n\n(5,5) has life span 9, at turn 11, after turns: turn 11,12,13,14,15, life decreases.\n\nStart turn 11: life 9\n\nAfter turn 11: 8\n\nAfter turn 12: 7\n\nAfter turn 13: 6\n\nAfter turn 14: 5\n\nAfter turn 15: 4\n\nStill plenty.\n\nBy turn 17, I can eat it.\n\nIn the sequence, after eating (3,5) on turn 15, head at (3,5), then turn 16 move R to (4,5), no food, turn 17 move R to (5,5) eat.\n\n(5,5) is at (5,5), which has food.\n\nNow, when moving to (5,5), is there any issue?\n\n(5,6) is wall above, but (5,5) is fine.\n\nAlso, tail danger: when I eat (5,5), where is tail?\n\nBut it depends on the path.\n\nSince I plan to eat it on turn 17, tail might be far.\n\nFor example, in the sequence:\n\nTurn 11: U to (1,5)\n\nTurn 12: U to (1,6) eat\n\nTurn 13: R to (2,6)\n\nTurn 14: D to (2,5)\n\nTurn 15: R to (3,5) eat\n\nNow after turn 15 eat (3,5): positions before move: head (2,5), body (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), tail (1,2)? Let's track positions.\n\nAfter turn 14 move to (2,5) no eat: positions at start of turn 15: head (2,5), body (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) tail? After turn 14:\n\nAfter turn 13: positions [(2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]\n\nTurn 14 move D to (2,5): no food, so new head (2,5), index1 to (2,6), index2 to (1,6), index3 to (1,5), index4 to (1,4), index5 to (1,3) // new tail (1,3)\n\nPositions: [(2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)]\n\nHead (2,5), direction D.\n\nTurn 15 move R to (3,5): eat food.\n\nNew head (3,5), then body: (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), and tail (1,3) remains, new segment added, so positions: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)] 7 segments.\n\nDirection from (2,5) to (3,5) is R.\n\nTurn 16: move R to (4,5) — empty, no food.\n\nNew positions: after move no eat, head (4,5), body (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) — tail moves to (1,3)? Old tail (1,3) moves.\n\nOld: head (3,5), body (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), tail (1,3)\n\nMove to (4,5) no eat: new head (4,5), index1 to (3,5), index2 to (2,5), index3 to (2,6), index4 to (1,6), index5 to (1,5), index6 to (1,4) // new tail (1,4)\n\nPositions: [(4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)]\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 17: move R to (5,5) eat food.\n\n(5,5) has food, so eat.\n\nThen grow.\n\nNow, is there tail danger? Tail is at (1,4), head at (5,5), not adjacent, fine.\n\nAlso, (5,6) is wall, but not moving there.\n\nSo I eat all three foods.\n\nIf I had gone Right on turn 11, I would miss (1,6), so worse.\n\nTherefore, for turn 11, I should move Up.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions starting from turn 11.\n\nI have a sequence: turn 11 U, turn 12 U, turn 13 R, turn 14 D, turn 15 R, then to (4,5) and (5,5), but I need at least 5 turns ahead from turn 11.\n\nTurn 11 to turn 15 is 5 turns: 11,12,13,14,15.\n\nBut turn 15 is the action on turn 15.\n\nIn the sequence above, I have actions up to turn 15.\n\nBut I can add more.\n\nThe format says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so at least 5 actions.\n\nIn my plan, I have:\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: R\n\nTurn 14: D\n\nTurn 15: R\n\nThen beyond, turn 16: R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 17: R to (5,5) eat\n\nBut for the answer, I can output up to turn 15 or more.\n\nSince the grid might have changes, but in this case, no new food, so I think up to turn 15 is fine.\n\nTo be safe, I can output until I eat (5,5), but it's not necessary.\n\nNow, in turn 14, I chose D to (2,5), but I could choose R to (3,6), which also allows me to eat (3,5) on turn 15 by moving down.\n\nBut moving to (2,5) is equally good, and it might be better because (2,5) is closer to the center or something, but not critical.\n\nI think D to (2,5) is fine.\n\nNow, about the internal obstacle at (5,6), but I'm not going there.\n\nAlso, borders are walls, so I need to avoid x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7.\n\nIn this path, I am moving within bounds.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: R\n\nTurn 14: D\n\nTurn 15: R\n\nI need to specify the direction.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's confirm if all moves are valid.\n\nTurn 11: from (1,4) move U to (1,5) - valid\n\nTurn 12: from (1,5) move U to (1,6) eat - valid\n\nTurn 13: from (1,6) move R to (2,6) - valid\n\nTurn 14: from (2,6) move D to (2,5) - valid, and direction was R, moving D is not opposite, fine.\n\nTurn 15: from (2,5) move R to (3,5) eat - valid.\n\nAfter that, I can continue, but for now, this should be fine.\n\nSince I need to think 5 turns ahead, this covers turn 11 to 15.\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 15 I eat (3,5), which is good.\n\nAnd I already ate (1,6).\n\n(5,5) later.\n\nSo I think this maximizes the score for the near term.\n\nIs there a better move?\n\nSuppose on turn 11 I move Right, then I can go directly to (3,5), but miss (1,6), so I get only 2 foods instead of 3 possible.\n\nUnless (1,6) is not reachable or something, but it is.\n\nSo Up is better.\n\nTherefore, the action plan.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned at least 5 turns ahead. The key considerations are:\n- Eating the positive food at (1,6) is time-sensitive (life span 3 at turn 11, decreasing to 2 after turn 11). It must be eaten by turn 12 to avoid expiration.\n- Moving Up on turn 11 allows eating (1,6) on turn 12, gaining +1 and increasing snake length.\n- After eating (1,6), moving Right to (2,6) on turn 13 avoids the top wall and positions the snake to reach (3,5) efficiently.\n- Moving Down to (2,5) on turn 14 brings the snake closer to (3,5), which can be eaten on turn 15.\n- This sequence secures two foods ((1,6) and (3,5)) by turn 15, with a path toward (5,5) for future turns. Missing (1,6) by moving Right on turn 11 would result in lower score.\n- All moves avoid walls, body collisions, and instant reverses. The tail is never adjacent to the head when eating, eliminating tail reward danger.\n\nThe planned actions for turns 11 to 15 are:\n- **Turn 11**: Move Up to (1,5) – Positions head to reach (1,6) next turn.\n- **Turn 12**: Move Up to (1,6) – Eats food at (1,6), snake grows to length 6.\n- **Turn 13**: Move Right to (2,6) – Avoids walls and body, direction now Right.\n- **Turn 14**: Move Down to (2,5) – Moves toward (3,5), no reverse issue.\n- **Turn 15**: Move Right to (3,5) – Eats food at (3,5), snake grows to length 7.\n\nBeyond turn 15, the snake can proceed toward (5,5) (e.g., Turn 16: Right to (4,5), Turn 17: Right to (5,5) to eat), but the 5-turn plan is complete.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U (up)  \nTurn 12: U (up)  \nTurn 13: R (right)  \nTurn 14: D (down)  \nTurn 15: R (right)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm the AI playing Snake. I need to maximize my score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I must think at least 5 turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nCurrent state at turn 12:\n\n- Walls: Border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, an internal obstacle at (5,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but borders are walls, so I can only move within x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6? Let me confirm.\n\nBorder cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. But (1,1) is occupied by the snake's tail, and (1,5) is the head.\n\nSnake positions: head at (1,5), then (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1). So the snake is vertical on x=1, from y=1 to y=5, head up. Head direction is U, which is up, so moving towards higher y.\n\nFood:\n\n- (1,6) with life span 2, value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (3,5) with life span 5, value 1\n\n- (5,5) with life span 8, value 1\n\nAll food is positive, so no negative food here.\n\nLife span means how many turns left before it disappears, including the current turn. So for (1,6), life span 2 at turn 12, so it will disappear after turn 13? Let's see: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn 12, life span is 2, meaning after this turn, it has one turn left, and after turn 13, it disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 12 or 13.\n\nSimilarly, (3,5) life span 5, so it can be eaten from turn 12 to 16, disappearing after turn 16.\n\n(5,5) life span 8, from turn 12 to 19.\n\nNow, the snake head is at (1,5), direction U. So moving up would go to (1,6). But (1,6) has food, and it's positive.\n\nBut (1,6) is within the grid? y=6, and walls at y=7, so y=6 is playable? Borders are y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is not a wall. Similarly, x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to x=6 are fine.\n\ny=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6 is playable? Let's list the coordinates.\n\nGrid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells like (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (1,0) to (6,0), (1,7) to (6,7) are walls? No.\n\n\"Cells occupied by walls: Border cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7.\" So any cell where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. For example, (0,1) is wall, (1,0) is wall, (1,7) is wall, etc. So the playable cells are where 1 ≤ x ≤ 6 and 1 ≤ y ≤ 6.\n\nYes, so (1,6) is at y=6, which is not y=7, so it's playable. Similarly, (1,1) to (1,6) are all within bounds except y=0 or y=7 would be walls, but y=1 to y=6 are fine.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,6), which is within playable area.\n\nSnake is at (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1). So it occupies the entire column x=1 from y=1 to y=5.\n\nHead at (1,5), direction U, so if I move up, to (1,6).\n\n(1,6) has food with value 1 and life span 2.\n\nBut I need to check if eating it is safe.\n\nFirst, movement: I can move U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse. Current direction is U, so I cannot move D (down) next turn, because that would be reverse.\n\nPossible moves: U (up), L (left), R (right). D is not allowed since it's reverse.\n\nNow, moving U to (1,6): that cell has food, so if I eat it, I grow by one segment. After eating, the new head is at (1,6), and the tail stays or moves? When snake eats, it grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn? Standard Snake: when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added, so the tail doesn't move that turn, meaning the snake grows by one.\n\nBut in terms of positions, after moving to a food cell, the snake length increases, and the positions are updated.\n\nAlso, collision: if head moves to a cell with body, it dies, except if it's the tail cell, because tail moves away.\n\nSpecial case: food under body. But here (1,6) is not under body; the snake is from y=1 to 5, so (1,6) is empty except for food.\n\n(1,6) has food, and no snake body there.\n\nSo if I move U to (1,6), I eat the food, length becomes 6, and the new positions: head at (1,6), then (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1) — but since I ate, a new segment is added, so positions should be: before move, head at (1,5), after move head to (1,6), and since ate, the tail doesn't move, so body segments stay, but a new head is added at (1,6), so the snake becomes: [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1)] — length 6.\n\nNow, is there any danger? After moving to (1,6), the head is at (1,6). Now, what about the tail? The tail is at (1,1). Is the head adjacent to tail? (1,6) and (1,1) are not adjacent; they are 5 cells apart.\n\nAdjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right. (1,6) and (1,1) are not adjacent; distance in y is 5.\n\nBut there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake.\n\nIn this case, the food is at (1,6), which is not the tail cell; tail is at (1,1). So no issue.\n\nThe danger is only if I eat food that is on the tail cell when head is adjacent to tail.\n\nBut here, food is at (1,6), tail at (1,1), so fine.\n\nNow, after eating, head at (1,6), which is y=6, and walls at y=7, so it's safe, but I need to think about future moves.\n\nLife span of (1,6) is 2, so if I don't eat it now, it might disappear, or I can eat it next turn.\n\nBut let's think ahead.\n\nAlso, other food: (3,5) and (5,5).\n\n(3,5) is at x=3,y=5, which is to the right.\n\n(5,5) is further right.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,6), so that cell is blocked.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves for at least 5 turns.\n\nFirst, possible actions this turn: I can go U, L, or R.\n\n- U: to (1,6), eat food, grow to length 6.\n\n- L: to (0,5) — but x=0 is wall, so collision! I cannot move left because (0,5) is wall.\n\nCurrent position (1,5), move L would be to (0,5), which is x=0, so wall, death.\n\nSimilarly, R: to (2,5), which is empty? Let's see the grid.\n\nPlayable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\n(2,5) is within bounds, and no snake body there? Snake is only on x=1, so (2,5) should be free.\n\nFood? (3,5) is food, but (2,5) no food mentioned, so empty.\n\nSimilarly, D: but D is down, to (1,4), but (1,4) is body! Head at (1,5), move D to (1,4), which is the second segment, so collision with body, death.\n\nCannot move D because it's reverse? Reverse is not allowed, but also moving to body.\n\nNo instant reverse: cannot move opposite, so since direction is U, cannot move D. But even if I could, moving to (1,4) is body, so death.\n\nSo possible moves: U or R? L is wall, D is invalid and body, so only U and R are possible.\n\nU: to (1,6)\n\nR: to (2,5)\n\nNow, if I go U, I eat the food at (1,6), and I'm at (1,6).\n\nIf I go R, to (2,5), no food there, so no eat, length same, tail moves.\n\nAfter move R to (2,5), head at (2,5), then body: (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), and tail (1,1) moves? When snake moves without eating, head moves to new position, and tail moves forward one cell.\n\nSo positions: before move: head (1,5), body (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), tail (1,1)\n\nAfter move R: head to (2,5), then the body follows: the segment that was at (1,5) moves to where head was? Standard: the head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo after move to (2,5): new head (2,5), then the first body segment was at (1,5), so it stays or moves? The segment that was behind head moves to head's old position.\n\nList:\n\nOld positions: index 0: head (1,5), index 1: (1,4), index 2: (1,3), index 3: (1,2), index 4: tail (1,1)\n\nAfter moving head to (2,5), new head (2,5). Then index 1 moves to where index 0 was, so to (1,5). Index 2 moves to where index 1 was, (1,4). Index 3 moves to where index 2 was, (1,3). Index 4 (tail) moves to where index 3 was, (1,2).\n\nSo new positions: head (2,5), then (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2). Tail was at (1,1), but it moved to (1,2)? Positions: [(2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)] so tail at (1,2).\n\nLength still 5, no growth.\n\nNow, back to choice: at turn 12, I can go U or R.\n\nIf I go U, I eat food at (1,6), grow to 6, head at (1,6).\n\nThen at turn 13, I need to move from (1,6). Direction would be U, but I just moved U, so direction is U.\n\nPossible moves from (1,6): U to (1,7), but y=7 is wall, death. D to (1,5), but (1,5) is now part of body? After eating at (1,6), positions: [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1)] so (1,5) is the second segment.\n\nIf I move D to (1,5), that's body, collision.\n\nL to (0,6), x=0 wall, death.\n\nR to (2,6), which might be free.\n\nSo from (1,6), only possible move is R to (2,6), since U, D, L all deadly.\n\nU to (1,7) wall, D to (1,5) body, L to (0,6) wall, R to (2,6) should be empty.\n\n(2,6) is within bounds, x=2,y=6, no wall, no body mentioned, so yes.\n\nSo if I go U at turn 12, I end up at (1,6) with only one move possible: R to (2,6) at turn 13.\n\nThen at turn 13, after moving R to (2,6), no food, so positions: head (2,6), then (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) — tail at (1,2)? After move without eat, tail moves.\n\nBefore turn 13 move: positions at start of turn 13: head (1,6), body (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), tail (1,1) — after eating at turn 12, tail didn't move, so positions are [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1)]\n\nNow move R to (2,6): new head (2,6), then the segments: index 1 moves to (1,6), but (1,6) is where head was, so (1,5) moves to (1,6)? Let's index: index 0: (1,6), index 1: (1,5), index 2: (1,4), index 3: (1,3), index 4: (1,2), index 5: (1,1)\n\nAfter head moves to (2,6), new head (2,6). Then index 1 moves to old index 0 position (1,6). Index 2 moves to old index 1 position (1,5). Index 3 moves to old index 2 position (1,4). Index 4 moves to old index 3 position (1,3). Index 5 (tail) moves to old index 4 position (1,2).\n\nSo new positions: [(2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)] tail at (1,2).\n\nNo food eaten, so length 6.\n\nNow, at turn 13, head at (2,6), direction from (1,6) to (2,6) is R, so new direction R.\n\nNow, possible moves: U to (2,7), but y=7 wall, death. D to (2,5), which might be free. L to (1,6), but (1,6) is now body? Positions have (1,6) as second segment, so yes, body, collision. R to (3,6), might be free.\n\nSo from (2,6), can move D to (2,5) or R to (3,6).\n\n(2,5) and (3,6) should be empty, I think.\n\nBut (3,5) has food, but (2,5) no.\n\nAlso, food at (3,5) with life span 5, at turn 12, so turn 13 it has life span 4? Life span decreases each turn.\n\nAt turn 12, food (1,6) life span 2, (3,5) life span 5, (5,5) life span 8.\n\nAfter turn 12, if not eaten, life span decreases.\n\nBut if I ate (1,6) at turn 12, it's gone.\n\nIn this path, I ate it.\n\nNow back to planning.\n\nIf I go U at turn 12, I eat, then at turn 13 I must go R to (2,6), then at turn 14 from (2,6), I can go D or R.\n\nIf I go D to (2,5), or R to (3,6).\n\nNow, let's consider the other option at turn 12: go R to (2,5).\n\nAt turn 12, go R to (2,5): no food, so positions: head (2,5), then (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), tail at (1,2)? After move: head (2,5), body (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), and tail moved from (1,1) to (1,2)? Earlier: [(2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)] and tail at (1,2), but (1,2) is now the last segment, and (1,1) is free.\n\nLength 5.\n\nHead at (2,5), direction R (since moved right from (1,5)).\n\nNow, possible moves: U to (2,6), D to (2,4), L to (1,5), R to (3,5).\n\n(1,5) is body, so L to (1,5) is collision, cannot.\n\nU to (2,6): empty? Probably.\n\nD to (2,4): empty? Snake is on x=1, so (2,4) should be free.\n\nR to (3,5): (3,5) has food! Value 1, life span 5 at turn 12.\n\nSo I can go to (3,5) and eat.\n\nBut let's not jump ahead; I need to think which turn 12 action is better.\n\nAlso, food at (1,6) with short life span; if I don't eat it now, it might disappear.\n\nAt turn 12, if I go R to (2,5), I don't eat (1,6), so at turn 13, (1,6) life span decreases to 1, meaning it will disappear after turn 13 if not eaten.\n\nBut from (2,5), I can go to (3,5) to eat, or other directions.\n\nNow, to maximize score and survive, I should eat the food when possible, but with long-term view.\n\nFirst, let's list the food and their life:\n\n- (1,6): life span 2 at turn 12, so must be eaten by turn 13 (since after turn 13 it disappears).\n\n- (3,5): life span 5, so by turn 16\n\n- (5,5): life span 8, by turn 19\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,6), so that cell is blocked.\n\nNow, snake is at (1,5) turn 12.\n\nIf I go U at turn 12, I eat (1,6), score +1, length 6, but then I'm stuck at (1,6) with only R move possible to (2,6) at turn 13.\n\nThen at (2,6), I can go D to (2,5) or R to (3,6).\n\nFrom (2,6), if I go D to (2,5), at turn 14, head to (2,5).\n\n(2,5) might have food? No, food is at (3,5) and (5,5).\n\nAt turn 13, after moving to (2,6), positions as before.\n\nThen if I go D to (2,5) at turn 14, no food, so positions: head to (2,5), then body moves.\n\nBut (2,5) is empty, so no eat.\n\nThen head at (2,5), direction D.\n\nThen I can go to (3,5) to eat, or other.\n\nBut let's see the state.\n\nFirst, in this path: turn 12 U to (1,6), eat, length 6.\n\nTurn 13: must R to (2,6), no eat.\n\nNow turn 14: from (2,6), head at (2,6), direction R (since moved right).\n\nCan move: U wall, D to (2,5), L to (1,6) body, R to (3,6).\n\nSo D or R.\n\nIf I go D to (2,5), at turn 14.\n\nThen positions: before move turn 14: head (2,6), body (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) — tail at (1,2)\n\nMove D to (2,5): new head (2,5), then index 1 moves to (2,6), index 2 to (1,6), index 3 to (1,5), index 4 to (1,4), index 5 to (1,3), so positions: [(2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)] tail at (1,3)\n\nNo food at (2,5), so no growth.\n\nHead at (2,5), direction D.\n\nThen turn 15: from (2,5), can move U to (2,6), but (2,6) is now body? Positions have (2,6) as second segment, so if move U to (2,6), collision.\n\nD to (2,4), which might be free.\n\nL to (1,5), (1,5) is body, collision.\n\nR to (3,5), which has food.\n\nSo possible: D to (2,4) or R to (3,5).\n\nIf I go R to (3,5), eat food, grow to 7.\n\nThen head at (3,5).\n\nDirection R.\n\nNow, from (3,5), at turn 15, after eating.\n\nBut let's not get too deep.\n\nIf at turn 14 from (2,6) I go R to (3,6) instead of D.\n\nBut (3,6) might be empty.\n\nThen head at (3,6), and so on.\n\nBut I need to compare to the other choice.\n\nAlternative: at turn 12, go R to (2,5).\n\nThen at turn 12, head at (2,5), no eat, length 5.\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 13: from (2,5), can move U to (2,6), D to (2,4), or R to (3,5) to eat.\n\nL to (1,5) is body, cannot.\n\n(1,5) is body, yes.\n\nNow, food at (1,6) is still there, life span 1 at turn 13.\n\nBut (1,6) is at (1,6), which is not adjacent to (2,5). From (2,5), I can only go U, D, R; no L.\n\nU to (2,6), D to (2,4), R to (3,5).\n\n(1,6) is at left, but I cannot go directly to (1,6) from (2,5); I would need to go left, but L is not possible because (1,5) is body.\n\nSo from (2,5), I cannot reach (1,6) directly; the only way is if I go to (2,6) then to (1,6), but (1,6) might be eaten or not.\n\nAt turn 13, if I go U to (2,6), then from (2,6) I can go L to (1,6), but (1,6) has food, and life span 1, so I can eat it if I move to it.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFirst, if at turn 12 I go R to (2,5), no eat.\n\nThen turn 13: I have choices.\n\nOption: go U to (2,6) at turn 13.\n\nThen move to (2,6), no food there? (2,6) has no food, so no eat.\n\nPositions: before turn 13, head (2,5), body (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) — tail at (1,2)\n\nMove U to (2,6): new head (2,6), then index 1 to (2,5), index 2 to (1,5), index 3 to (1,4), index 4 to (1,3), so positions: [(2,6), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)] tail at (1,3)\n\nHead at (2,6), direction U.\n\nThen I can go to (1,6) from here? From (2,6), I can move L to (1,6), which has food.\n\nAt turn 14, from (2,6), move L to (1,6).\n\n(1,6) has food, life span at turn 13 was 1, but at turn 14, it might be gone? Life span decreases each turn.\n\nAt turn 12, (1,6) life span 2.\n\nAfter turn 12, if not eaten, at turn 13, life span 1.\n\nAfter turn 13, if not eaten, it disappears.\n\nSo at turn 13, (1,6) is still there with life span 1.\n\nIf I move to (1,6) at turn 13 or turn 14? Turn 13 I can move to it if I go from (2,5) to (1,6), but I can't directly; from (2,5), I can only go U, D, R; not L.\n\nSo at turn 13, I can go U to (2,6), which is not (1,6).\n\nThen at turn 14, from (2,6), I can go L to (1,6).\n\nBut at turn 14, (1,6) would have life span 0? Let's clarify.\n\nAt start of turn 12, (1,6) life span 2.\n\nAfter turn 12 is executed, if not eaten, life span decreases by 1, so at start of turn 13, life span 1.\n\nIf not eaten during turn 13, after turn 13, it disappears, so not available at turn 14.\n\nTherefore, to eat (1,6), I must move to it on turn 12 or turn 13.\n\nOn turn 12, I can move to it from (1,5) by going U.\n\nOn turn 13, I can move to it from a adjacent cell, but from where?\n\nAt turn 13, the head is at (2,5) if I went R at turn 12.\n\nFrom (2,5), (1,6) is not adjacent; adjacent cells are (2,6), (2,4), (3,5), (1,5) — (1,5) is body, not accessible.\n\n(1,6) is at (1,6), which is adjacent to (1,5) and (2,6) and (1,7) but y=7 wall, and (0,6) wall.\n\nSo from (2,5), I can go to (2,6), which is adjacent to (1,6).\n\nThen from (2,6), at turn 14, I can go to (1,6), but turn 14 is too late; (1,6) disappears after turn 13 if not eaten.\n\nSo at turn 13, if head is at (2,5), I cannot move directly to (1,6); the only way is to go to (2,6) at turn 13, but (2,6) is not (1,6), so I don't eat it on turn 13.\n\nThen after turn 13, it disappears.\n\nSo if I don't eat (1,6) on turn 12, I miss it forever, because on turn 13 I can't reach it from (2,5).\n\nIf at turn 13 I go to (2,6), I'm not eating (1,6), so it disappears.\n\nTherefore, the only way to eat (1,6) is to go U at turn 12.\n\nIf I go R at turn 12, I lose the chance to eat (1,6).\n\nNow, eating it gives +1 score and grows the snake, which might be good, but growing longer could make it harder to maneuver, but in this case, the snake is only length 5, grid 6x6 playable, so plenty of space.\n\nBut if I eat it, I go to (1,6) and then I'm cornered, with only one move to (2,6), then from there I can go to other areas.\n\nIf I don't eat it, I go to (2,5), and I can go to (3,5) to eat that food.\n\nBut I miss +1 from (1,6).\n\nMoreover, (1,6) has short life, so if I don't eat it, it's wasted.\n\nNow, let's think about long-term survival.\n\nIf I eat (1,6) at turn 12, I go to (1,6), then to (2,6) at turn 13, then from (2,6) I can go to (2,5) or (3,6).\n\n(2,5) is close to (3,5) food.\n\n(3,5) has life span 5 at turn 12, so after turn 12, if not eaten, at turn 13 life span 4, etc.\n\nIf I go to (2,6) at turn 13, then I can go D to (2,5) at turn 14.\n\nThen at (2,5), I can go R to (3,5) to eat at turn 15, for example.\n\nAs I thought earlier.\n\nThen I eat (3,5), grow to 7.\n\nThen from (3,5), I can go to other places.\n\nThere is also (5,5) food.\n\nBut with internal obstacle at (5,6), so the area around (5,5) might be tricky.\n\nNow, if at turn 12 I go R to (2,5), then at turn 13 I can go directly to (3,5) to eat.\n\nFor example, turn 12: go R to (2,5), no eat.\n\nTurn 13: go R to (3,5), eat food, grow to 6.\n\nThen head at (3,5), direction R.\n\nThen I can move from there.\n\nBut I missed the (1,6) food.\n\nIn this case, I get +1 from (3,5), but lost +1 from (1,6), so net zero? But I have the same length, but I ate one food later? No, if I eat (1,6) I have length 6 earlier, and I can eat more.\n\nBut let's compare score.\n\nFirst path: eat (1,6) at turn 12, score +1.\n\nThen at turn 15, I can eat (3,5), for another +1, total +2.\n\nSecond path: no eat turn 12, eat (3,5) at turn 13, score +1, but missed (1,6), so only +1 so far.\n\nThen I can eat (5,5) later for +1, but same as first path.\n\nBut in first path, I ate earlier, so I have longer snake, but that might not be better for survival if space is tight.\n\nGrid is 6x6=36 cells, snake length 5 or 6, still small.\n\nBut with obstacle, it might be ok.\n\nMoreover, if I go to (1,6) first, I might be near the border.\n\nBut let's see the position after eating (3,5).\n\nIn first path: after turn 14, if I go to (2,5) from (2,6), then at turn 15 go to (3,5) eat.\n\nPositions: at turn 15, head to (3,5), eat, grow.\n\nBefore move, positions: at start turn 15, from previous, after turn 14 move to (2,5), positions: [(2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)] for length 6? Earlier I had length 6 after eating (1,6).\n\nAt turn 15 start: let's trace.\n\nTurn 12: U to (1,6) eat, positions: [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1)]\n\nTurn 13: R to (2,6) no eat, positions: [(2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]  // tail at (1,2)\n\nTurn 14: say go D to (2,5) no eat, positions: [(2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)]  // tail at (1,3)\n\nTurn 15: go R to (3,5) eat, so head to (3,5), eat, grow, positions: new head (3,5), then body: (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) and new segment, so length 7: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)] tail at (1,3)\n\nHead at (3,5), direction R.\n\nNow from here, I can go to (4,5) or (3,4) or (3,6), etc.\n\n(5,5) has food, so I can go right.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (5,6), so (5,6) is blocked.\n\nSo from (3,5), go R to (4,5), then to (5,5) to eat.\n\n(5,5) life span 8, so plenty of time.\n\nNow, in the second path, if I go R at turn 12 to (2,5) no eat.\n\nTurn 13: go R to (3,5) eat, positions: turn 12 to (2,5): positions [(2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)] tail at (1,2)\n\nTurn 13 to (3,5) eat: new head (3,5), then body: (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) and new segment, so [(3,5), (2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)] length 6, tail at (1,2)\n\nThen from (3,5), same as above, I can go to (4,5) etc.\n\nBut I missed (1,6) food, so I have one less point and shorter snake by one.\n\nIn this case, at turn 13, I have length 6 after eating (3,5), whereas in first path, at turn 13 I have length 6 after eating (1,6) at turn 12.\n\nThen at turn 15, I eat (3,5) in first path, getting to length 7.\n\nIn second path, I eat (3,5) at turn 13, length 6, then later eat (5,5) to length 7.\n\nBut I missed one food, so lower score.\n\nMoreover, by not eating (1,6), it disappears, so no benefit.\n\nTherefore, it's better to eat (1,6) at turn 12.\n\nBut in the first path, when I go to (1,6), I have to go to (2,6) next, which is fine, and then I can access the other food.\n\nIs there a risk of dead end?\n\nFor example, after being at (1,6) and (2,6), I have the body below, but I can move down or right.\n\nFrom (2,6) I can go D to (2,5), which is free, then to (3,5).\n\nNo immediate danger.\n\nIf I don't eat (1,6), and go directly to (3,5), I save a turn or something, but I lose the food, so net loss.\n\nPerhaps I can eat both, but in this case, by eating (1,6) first, I can still eat (3,5) later.\n\nAnother thing: the tail reward danger, but not applicable here.\n\nAlso, the food at (1,6) might be under body, but it's not; it's free.\n\nSo I think going U at turn 12 is better.\n\nBut let's confirm the moves for multiple turns.\n\nI need to output actions for turn 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 at least.\n\nSince I have to think 5 turns ahead, I should plan a sequence.\n\nStart turn 12.\n\nAction: U to (1,6), eat food.\n\nNow turn 13: from (1,6), only possible move R to (2,6), no eat.\n\nDirection now R.\n\nTurn 14: from (2,6), I can go D to (2,5) or R to (3,6).\n\n(2,5) is closer to (3,5) food, so better to go D to (2,5) to approach the food.\n\nGo D to (2,5), no food there.\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 15: from (2,5), can move D to (2,4), or R to (3,5), or U to (2,6) but (2,6) is body? Positions at turn 14 end: after move to (2,5), positions: head (2,5), body (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) — tail at (1,3)\n\nAt turn 15, move R to (3,5): (3,5) has food, so eat, grow to length 7.\n\nHead to (3,5), positions: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)] and new segment? Since ate, tail doesn't move, so positions: new head (3,5), then (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) — but (1,3) is tail, and since ate, it stays, so the new tail is still (1,3), but the snake grows, so we add a new segment where? Standard: when eat, head moves to food, new segment added at tail? No.\n\nIn Snake, when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added at the tail position, but since tail doesn't move, the new segment is the old tail position, so the tail stays, and the segment before tail becomes part of body.\n\nPositions: before move, head at (2,5), tail at (1,3)\n\nAfter move head to (3,5), since ate, the tail does not move, so the new positions: head (3,5), then the previous segments: (2,5) becomes next, (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), and a new segment is added at the old tail position? I think I'm confusing.\n\nStandard: the snake moves one step: head to new cell. If no eat, tail moves forward one cell, so last segment removed.\n\nIf eat, tail does not move, so the new head position is added, and no segment removed, so length increases by one.\n\nIn terms of positions: let's say before move, positions: P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk (head to tail)\n\nAfter move to new cell N: if no food, new head N, then P0, P1, ..., P_{k-1} (tail is P_{k-1})\n\nIf food, new head N, then P0, P1, ..., Pk (tail is Pk)\n\nSo in this case, turn 15 start: positions [(2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)] so head (2,5), tail (1,3)\n\nMove to (3,5), eat, so new positions: head (3,5), then (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) and since ate, tail stays, so positions: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)] length 7, tail at (1,3)\n\nNow head at (3,5), direction R.\n\nNow, from here, I can go to (4,5), or (3,4), or (3,6), etc.\n\n(5,5) has food, so I should go right.\n\nGo R to (4,5) at turn 16.\n\nBut I need to output up to turn 16 or so.\n\nFirst, let's list the actions.\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: R\n\nTurn 14: D (to (2,5))\n\nTurn 15: R (to (3,5) eat)\n\nNow turn 16: from (3,5), after eating, head at (3,5), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,6), D to (3,4), L to (2,5) but (2,5) is body, cannot, R to (4,5).\n\n(2,5) is second segment, so body, collision if move L.\n\nSo can go U, D, or R.\n\n(5,5) is at (5,5), so to go right, R to (4,5).\n\n(4,5) should be empty, no food.\n\nGo R to (4,5) no eat.\n\nThen positions update.\n\nBut I think for the answer, I need to output actions for several turns, but since the state changes, I might not need to specify all, but to demonstrate thinking ahead.\n\nIn this sequence, I ate two foods: (1,6) and (3,5), and I can eat (5,5) later.\n\nIf I didn't eat (1,6), I only ate one so far.\n\nMoreover, survival: no immediate risks.\n\nNow, what about the other move at turn 14?\n\nAt turn 14, from (2,6), instead of going D to (2,5), I could go R to (3,6).\n\nBut (3,6) might be farther from (3,5), so it takes longer to get to food.\n\nFor example, if go to (3,6) at turn 14, then I need to go down to (3,5) later.\n\nBut (3,5) might be eaten or not, but in this case, only me, so I can eat it later.\n\nBut life span is enough, so possible, but going directly to (2,5) is more efficient to reach (3,5).\n\nSo D is better.\n\nNow, back to turn 12 action: U seems better.\n\nBut is there a reason to avoid (1,6)? For example, if I eat it, I go to (1,6) and then I must go right, but that might be ok.\n\nAnother thing: the head is near the tail or something? No, tail is at (1,1) initially, far away.\n\nSo I think U is the best.\n\nTherefore, for turn 12, action U.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I can plan as above.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output a sequence.\n\nSince the problem says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions starting from turn 12.\n\nAnd in the format, it should be like:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: R\n\netc.\n\nBut I don't need to specify all if not necessary, but to show I thought ahead.\n\nPerhaps I should output 5 turns.\n\nCurrent turn 12, so turns 12 to 16 or 17.\n\nBut let's define the sequence.\n\nAlso, in the move from (2,6), I chose D to (2,5), but let's confirm if (2,5) is safe.\n\nAt turn 14, positions before move: head at (2,6), body (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) — tail at (1,2)\n\nMove D to (2,5): (2,5) is empty, so no issue.\n\nThen head at (2,5), etc.\n\nNo problem.\n\nIf I go R to (3,6) at turn 14, then head at (3,6), then I can go D to (3,5) to eat at turn 15.\n\nSimilar, but I reach (3,5) at same turn or later.\n\nTurn 14 go to (3,6), then turn 15 go to (3,5) eat.\n\nSame as going to (2,5) at turn 14 and (3,5) at turn 15.\n\nBut from (2,5) to (3,5) is right, whereas from (3,6) to (3,5) is down, but same turn to eat.\n\nIn both cases, I eat at turn 15.\n\nBut in the first, I moved to (2,5) which is not necessary, but no harm.\n\nEfficiency might be similar.\n\nBut I think D is fine.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 12: U (to eat (1,6))\n\nTurn 13: R (to (2,6), only choice)\n\nTurn 14: D (to (2,5), to approach (3,5))\n\nTurn 15: R (to (3,5) eat)\n\nThen turn 16: from (3,5), go R to (4,5) or other, but I need to think.\n\nSince I have to output, perhaps up to turn 16.\n\nTurn 16: R to (4,5) for example.\n\nBut not critical.\n\nTo think 5 turns ahead from turn 12: turns 12,13,14,15,16.\n\nSo actions for these.\n\nIn turn 16, I might eat (5,5) or something, but not necessarily.\n\n(5,5) is at (5,5), from (4,5) I can go to (5,5) next turn.\n\nLife span 8 at turn 12, so at turn 16, life span 4, still available.\n\nBut I don't need to specify beyond.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: R\n\nTurn 14: D\n\nTurn 15: R\n\nTurn 16: R (to (4,5))\n\nAt turn 15, after moving to (3,5) and eating, head at (3,5), then turn 16 go R to (4,5).\n\n(4,5) should be empty.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (5,5) later.\n\nBut for now, this seems good.\n\nIf at turn 14 I go R to (3,6), then turn 15 go D to (3,5), same effect.\n\nBut I think the sequence is fine.\n\nNow, to box the answer.\n\nBut in the format, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 12: U Turn 13: R Turn 14: D Turn 15: R Turn 16: R }\n\nBut let's write it properly.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I evaluated the current state and planned at least 5 turns ahead (turns 12 to 16). The key considerations are:\n- **Immediate risk**: At turn 12, moving left (L) leads to a wall at (0,5), and moving down (D) is invalid (reverse move) and causes body collision at (1,4). Only up (U) or right (R) are safe.\n- **Food prioritization**: The food at (1,6) has a short life span (2 at turn 12, disappearing after turn 13). Eating it provides +1 score and grows the snake, but missing it wastes the opportunity. The food at (3,5) (life span 5) can be eaten later, and (5,5) (life span 8) is a longer-term target.\n- **Long-term survival**: After eating (1,6), the snake is at (1,6) with limited moves (only right to (2,6) is safe at turn 13). From there, moving down to (2,5) at turn 14 positions the snake to eat (3,5) efficiently at turn 15. This path scores +2 by turn 15 (eating both (1,6) and (3,5)) and avoids dead ends. Skipping (1,6) loses the +1 and provides no advantage, as the snake can still navigate to other food safely.\n- **Collision avoidance**: All moves are checked for body/wall collisions. After eating, the snake grows, but positions are managed to prevent self-collision (e.g., tail movement is handled correctly). The internal obstacle at (5,6) is avoided in future planning.\n- **5-turn plan**: The sequence below eats (1,6) at turn 12 and (3,5) at turn 15, maximizing score with minimal risk. Turn 16 moves toward (5,5) for potential future scoring.\n\n**Planned Moves (Turns 12-16):**\n- **Turn 12: U (up)** – Move to (1,6) to eat the positive food (value +1, life span 2). This avoids wasting the food, grows the snake to length 6, and is safe (no collision; head now at (1,6)).\n- **Turn 13: R (right)** – Move to (2,6). Only safe move from (1,6) (up to wall, down to body, left to wall). No food eaten; snake length remains 6. Head now at (2,6), direction right.\n- **Turn 14: D (down)** – Move to (2,5). Safer than right (to (3,6)) as it positions closer to (3,5) food. No food; snake length 6. Head now at (2,5), direction down.\n- **Turn 15: R (right)** – Move to (3,5) to eat positive food (value +1, life span 5 at turn 12, now 2 at turn 15). Safe and efficient; snake grows to length 7. Head now at (3,5), direction right.\n- **Turn 16: R (right)** – Move to (4,5). Advances toward (5,5) food for future eating (life span allows). No food; snake length 7. Safe, with no immediate threats.\n\n**Reasoning for 5+ Turns Ahead:**\n- **Turn 12 choice analysis**: Going U eats (1,6) immediately, scoring +1 and growing. Going R misses (1,6), leading to lower score (-1 net by turn 15) with no survival benefit. U is optimal.\n- **Risk assessment**: After U, the path to (2,6) and (2,5) avoids walls/body. Eating (3,5) at turn 15 is timed before it expires (life span 0 after turn 16).\n- **Future beyond turn 16**: From (4,5) at turn 16, the snake can move right to (5,5) at turn 17 to eat (life span 7 at turn 12, now 3 at turn 16) for another +1. The grid has space (36 cells, snake length 7), and obstacle at (5,6) can be navigated around (e.g., via (5,4) or (4,5)).\n- **Survival focus**: No risky moves are made; all actions ensure the snake can access remaining food and avoid traps (e.g., no cornering at (1,6) due to escape to (2,6)).\n\nThis plan scores +2 by turn 15, with a path to +3 by turn 17, while maintaining safety.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: R\nTurn 14: D\nTurn 15: R\nTurn 16: R\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 13, and the grid is 8x8 since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So coordinates range from (0,0) to (7,7), but (0,0) is a wall, so playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is bounded by these. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (1,6), then (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1). So the snake is vertical, along x=1, from y=1 to y=6. Head at (1,6), which is near the top since y=7 is the wall. y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top? Typically in grids, y increases upwards, but in this notation, it might be different. Let's see the movement: U is (x,y+1), so y increases upwards. So (1,6) is y=6, which is one below the top wall at y=7.\n\nHead direction is U, so currently moving upwards. But (1,6) moving up would be to (1,7), but y=7 is a wall, so moving up is impossible. That can't be right. Current head position is (1,6), and direction is U, but (1,7) is a wall, so the snake must have moved to (1,6) from below, I think. Positions are given as [(1,6), (1,5), ...], so head is (1,6), and it came from (1,5), so it moved up to (1,6). But now, from (1,6), moving up to (1,7) is impossible because it's a wall. So for the next move, since direction is U, but U is blocked, I need to choose a different direction.\n\nThe movement constraint says: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\" Current direction is U, so opposite is D. So I cannot move down immediately. Possible moves from (1,6) are: left to (0,6), but x=0 is wall, so blocked; right to (2,6), which should be free; up to (1,7) wall, blocked; down to (1,5), but that's the body, and also it's reverse, which is not allowed.\n\nDown is opposite to current direction U, so I cannot move down. So only possible move is right to (2,6)? But let's list the neighbors:\n\n- Up: (1,7) - wall, invalid\n\n- Down: (1,5) - body segment, but is it a collision? The snake positions are [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4), ...], so (1,5) is the second segment, which is the neck. If I move down to (1,5), that would be head colliding with the body immediately, which is deadly. Also, since it's the opposite direction, I cannot do that anyway.\n\n- Left: (0,6) - x=0 wall, invalid\n\n- Right: (2,6) - now, what is at (2,6)? It's not in snake positions, and not a wall except for borders. Snake positions are only on x=1, y=1 to 6, so (2,6) should be empty. Also, no internal obstacles mentioned at (2,6), only (5,6) is obstacle.\n\nInternal obstacle is at (5,6), so (2,6) is free.\n\nTherefore, from (1,6), with head direction U, possible actions are: since U is blocked, I can only move R (right) to (2,6), because L is wall, D is body and reverse, not allowed.\n\nThe rule says: \"No instant reverse\", meaning I cannot move directly opposite on the next turn. But here, since U is blocked, I have to choose another direction, and R is perpendicular, so should be fine.\n\nAlso, moving to (2,6) is safe because it's empty.\n\nNow, food positions:\n\n- (3,5) with value 1, life_span 4\n\n- (5,5) with value 1, life_span 7\n\n- (4,5) with value 1, life_span 10\n\nAll food have value +1, so all positive food.\n\nLife_span: for (3,5), life_span 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns including current? The description says: \"disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo for food at (3,5), life_span 4, on turn 13, it will disappear after turn 13 + 3? Let's see.\n\nIf life_span is N, it disappears after N turns from now, meaning it lasts for N more turns including the current one? I need to clarify.\n\n\"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so on the turn it appears, countdown is N, and it decreases each turn, so after N turns, countdown is 0, and it disappears. So it exists for N turns: from turn t to turn t + N - 1? Let's think.\n\nSuppose food appears at turn t with life_span N. On turn t, countdown = N. After turn t, countdown decreases to N-1. On turn t+1, countdown N-1, and so on, until countdown reaches 0, and it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + N - 1. On turn t + N - 1, countdown=1, can be eaten, then after that, on turn t+N, it disappears.\n\nIn this case, turn 13, food at (3,5) has life_span 4, so countdown starts at 4 on turn 13. So it can be eaten on turn 13,14,15,16? On turn 13, countdown=4, after turn 13, countdown=3, so it exists until turn 13 + 3 = 16? Let's define:\n\n- On turn when food is present, countdown decreases at the end of the turn.\n\nBut for eating, it can be eaten during the turn when the head moves onto it.\n\nThe life_span is given for the current state, so on turn t1=13, for (3,5), life_span=4, meaning it has 4 turns left including current. So after 4 turns, it will disappear. Specifically:\n\n- Turn 13: life_span 4, can be eaten\n\n- Turn 14: life_span 3, can be eaten\n\n- Turn 15: life_span 2, can be eaten\n\n- Turn 16: life_span 1, can be eaten\n\n- After turn 16, disappears, so not on turn 17.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) life_span 7: exists until turn 13+6=19? Turn 13:7, 14:6, ..., up to turn 19:1, then disappears on turn 20.\n\nTurn 13: countdown=7\n\nAfter turn 13: countdown=6\n\nTurn 14: countdown=6, etc.\n\nBetter to think: food with life_span N on turn t exists for N turns, from turn t to turn t + N - 1 inclusive.\n\nFor (3,5): life_span 4, so exists turns 13,14,15,16\n\n(5,5): life_span 7, exists turns 13 to 19\n\n(4,5): life_span 10, exists turns 13 to 22\n\nAll at y=5, x=3,4,5.\n\nNow, snake head at (1,6), moving to (2,6) is the only immediate option, as we thought.\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, but walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,6), so (5,6) is blocked.\n\nSnake: positions (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) — head at (1,6).\n\nSo snake length 6.\n\nFood at (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) — all on row y=5, x=3,4,5.\n\nNow, from (1,6), I must move right to (2,6) because other moves are invalid.\n\nAfter moving to (2,6), the snake positions will be: head at (2,6), then (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), and (1,1) will be the tail, which moves away if we move.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the head goes to a new cell, and the tail is removed, unless we eat food.\n\nIf no food eaten, snake moves to new head position, and tail position is freed.\n\nIn this case, moving to (2,6), no food there, so new positions: head (2,6), body (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2). Tail (1,1) is removed.\n\nDirection: after moving right, head direction becomes R.\n\nNow, from (2,6), possible moves:\n\n- U: (2,7) - y=7 wall, invalid\n\n- D: (2,5) - empty, I think\n\n- L: (1,6) - now, (1,6) is the body segment (the previous head, now second segment), so moving left to (1,6) would be collision with body, deadly. Also, L is opposite to current direction R? Current direction after move is R, so moving L would be reverse.\n\nAfter moving to (2,6), head direction is R.\n\nThen possible moves:\n\n- U: (2,7) wall, invalid\n\n- D: (2,5) - is this free? Let's see: snake positions after move: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2). So (2,5) not occupied, and not wall, so free.\n\n- L: (1,6) - occupied by body, collision, and also reverse direction.\n\n- R: (3,6) - should be free.\n\nSo from (2,6), I can move D to (2,5) or R to (3,6).\n\nNow, I need to think about food. Food is at (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), all on y=5.\n\n(2,5) is at y=5, x=2, which might be a good position to go towards food.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nAlso, there's the internal obstacle at (5,6), which might affect access to (5,5).\n\nNow, since I have to think 5+ turns ahead, I should simulate possible sequences.\n\nFirst, turn t1=13: I must move R to (2,6). No choice.\n\nAfter that, state for turn 14:\n\nHead at (2,6), direction R.\n\nFood: (3,5) life_span now 3 (since decreased by one after turn 13), similarly (5,5) life_span 6, (4,5) life_span 9.\n\nNow, from (2,6), I can move D to (2,5) or R to (3,6).\n\nIf I move D to (2,5), then head at (2,5), and (2,5) has no food, so snake becomes: head (2,5), body (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), tail (1,2) removed? Positions: after moving to (2,5), head (2,5), previous head (2,6) is now second, then (1,6), (1,5), etc. down to (1,2), and (1,1) was tail and removed.\n\nList: before move: positions [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1)] head at (1,6)\n\nMove R to (2,6): new positions [(2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)] tail (1,1) removed, head direction R.\n\nNow, from here, if move D to (2,5): head to (2,5), no food, so new positions: head (2,5), then (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), and tail (1,2) removed. So snake: [(2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)]\n\nDirection now D.\n\nIf from (2,6) move R to (3,6): head to (3,6), no food, so positions: [(3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)] tail (1,2) removed.\n\nDirection R.\n\nNow, back to choices at turn 14.\n\nOption 1: Move D to (2,5)\n\nThen at (2,5), which is above the food row. Food is at (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), so (2,5) is one left of (3,5).\n\nFrom (2,5), direction D, possible moves:\n\n- U: (2,6) - body segment, collision, and reverse direction? Current direction is D, U is opposite, so cannot move U.\n\n- D: (2,4) - should be free\n\n- L: (1,5) - now, (1,5) is a body segment, occupied, so collision\n\n- R: (3,5) - has food!\n\n(3,5) has food with value +1.\n\nSo from (2,5), I can move D to (2,4) or R to (3,5) to eat food.\n\nMoving to (3,5) would eat the food, since head moves onto it.\n\nThen snake grows: head moves to (3,5), eats food, so new segment added, tail doesn't move. Positions: head (3,5), then previous positions: body was [(2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)] but since ate food, tail stays, so new positions: head (3,5), then (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) — length 7 now.\n\n(1,5) is still there, but head is at (3,5), so no collision.\n\nDirection: after moving R to (3,5), head direction R.\n\nNow, if I move D to (2,4) from (2,5), no food, so positions: head (2,4), then (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), and tail (1,3) removed.\n\nDirection D.\n\nBut (2,4) is away from food.\n\nNow, back to turn 14 choice.\n\nIf at turn 14 I move R to (3,6) from (2,6).\n\nThen at (3,6), direction R.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (3,7) wall, invalid\n\n- D: (3,5) - has food!\n\n- L: (2,6) - body segment, collision, and reverse direction\n\n- R: (4,6) - should be free, but there's obstacle at (5,6), but (4,6) is free.\n\nSo from (3,6), I can move D to (3,5) to eat food, or R to (4,6).\n\nMoving to (3,5) eats the food at (3,5).\n\nThen snake grows: head (3,5), then (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) — length 7.\n\nDirection D after move.\n\nIf move R to (4,6), no food, positions: head (4,6), then (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), tail (1,3) removed.\n\nDirection R.\n\nNow, I need to think about multiple turns.\n\nAlso, there is a risk with tail reward danger.\n\nFor example, if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut currently, tail is at (1,2) or moving.\n\nIn the state after turn 13 move, tail is at (1,2).\n\nAfter moving to (2,6), positions: [(2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)] so tail at (1,2).\n\nHead at (2,6), not adjacent to tail (1,2). Adjacent means sharing a side, so (2,6) and (1,2) are not adjacent; different x and y.\n\nAfter some moves, tail might be closer.\n\nBut for now, let's plan to eat food.\n\nThe food at (3,5) has short life, only until turn 16, so I should eat it soon.\n\nSimilarly, others have longer life.\n\nBut since all are +1, I should eat when possible without risk.\n\nNow, from turn 13, I must move R to (2,6).\n\nThen on turn 14, I have choices.\n\nOption A: Move D to (2,5) at turn 14.\n\nThen at (2,5), I can move R to (3,5) to eat food on turn 15.\n\nOr move D to (2,4) to avoid eating now, but that might not be good.\n\nIf I eat on turn 15, that's fine.\n\nLet's simulate turn by turn.\n\nFirst, turn 13: move R to (2,6) — only choice.\n\nNow turn 14: I can choose to move D or R.\n\nIf I move D to (2,5), then on turn 15, from (2,5), I can move R to (3,5) to eat food.\n\nAfter eating, head at (3,5), direction R.\n\nThen on turn 16, from (3,5), possible moves:\n\n- U: (3,6) — but (3,6) is body segment? After eating on turn 15, positions: after move to (3,5), ate food, so positions: head (3,5), then (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) — since ate, tail stayed, so (1,3) is tail.\n\n(1,5) is also there, but head at (3,5).\n\nNow from (3,5), direction R.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: (3,6) — is it occupied? In positions, (2,6) is a segment, but (3,6) is not listed; positions are (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3). So (3,6) is free, I think.\n\n- D: (3,4) — should be free\n\n- L: (2,5) — occupied by body, collision\n\n- R: (4,5) — has food! (4,5) is food.\n\n(4,5) is food with value 1.\n\nSo I can move R to (4,5) to eat another food on turn 16.\n\nThen after eating, head at (4,5), positions: head (4,5), then (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), and tail (1,3) stays? Since ate food, new segment, so positions: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), and (1,3) is still tail? No: when head moves to new cell and eats, the tail does not move, so the snake grows by one.\n\nPrevious length was 7: segments from head to tail.\n\nAfter eating at (3,5) on turn 15, snake length 7: positions (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)\n\nThen on turn 16, move to (4,5), eat food, so head to (4,5), new segment, so positions: head (4,5), then (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) — but (1,3) is tail, and since ate, tail stays, so now 8 segments: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen from (4,5), I can move to (5,5) to eat another food on turn 17.\n\n(5,5) is food.\n\nMove R to (5,5), eat, grow to length 9.\n\nBut there is obstacle at (5,6), which might be a problem later.\n\nAlso, after eating (5,5), head at (5,5), then I need to move somewhere.\n\nBut let's see the tail position.\n\nIn this sequence, tail is at (1,3), which is far.\n\nBut when I eat (5,5), on turn 17.\n\nFood at (5,5) has life_span 7 on turn 13, so on turn 17 it still exists, since turn 13 to 19.\n\nTurn 13: life_span 7, exists\n\nTurn 14:6, turn15:5, turn16:4, turn17:3, yes.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) life_span 10, plenty of time.\n\nBut in this sequence, I can eat all three foods in a row: (3,5) on turn15, (4,5) on turn16, (5,5) on turn17.\n\nIs that possible?\n\nFrom turn 13: move R to (2,6)\n\nTurn 14: move D to (2,5)\n\nTurn 15: move R to (3,5) eat first food\n\nTurn 16: move R to (4,5) eat second food\n\nTurn 17: move R to (5,5) eat third food\n\nThen on turn 17, head at (5,5), direction R.\n\nNow, possible moves: U to (5,6), but (5,6) is internal obstacle, wall, so invalid.\n\nD to (5,4) — should be free\n\nL to (4,5) — body segment, collision\n\nR to (6,5) — should be free, but x=6, y=5, within bounds.\n\nx=6 is not wall, x=7 is wall, so (6,5) is playable.\n\nBut after eating, positions: let's list.\n\nAfter turn 16: after eating (4,5), positions: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) — length 8\n\nTurn 17: move to (5,5), eat, so head (5,5), then (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), and tail (1,3) stays? Since ate, new segment, so positions: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) — length 9\n\nDirection R.\n\nNow from (5,5), cannot move U to (5,6) obstacle.\n\nCannot move L to (4,5) body.\n\nCan move D to (5,4) or R to (6,5).\n\nIf move R to (6,5), then to (7,5) but x=7 wall, so later might be stuck, but not immediately.\n\n(6,5) is free, I assume.\n\nBut let's see if there are risks.\n\nAnother thing: the tail is at (1,3), which is not near, so no tail reward danger.\n\nBut after moving to (5,5), if I move D to (5,4), that might be better to go down.\n\nBut I need to think beyond.\n\nFirst, this sequence seems good to eat all food quickly.\n\nBut on turn 14, I had another choice: from (2,6) move R to (3,6) instead of D to (2,5).\n\nIf I move to (3,6) on turn 14, then I can move D to (3,5) to eat food on turn 15.\n\nThen similar to before.\n\nBut if I eat on turn 15 from (3,6), moving D to (3,5), then head at (3,5), direction D.\n\nThen on turn 16, from (3,5), I can move R to (4,5) to eat, or D to (3,4), etc.\n\nBut if I move R to (4,5), eat, then turn 17 to (5,5), same as before.\n\nBut in this case, on turn 14 I go to (3,6) first, which might not be necessary, since from (2,6) moving directly to (2,5) then to (3,5) is shorter to the food.\n\nIn terms of turns to eat, both can eat on turn 15.\n\nBut in the first sequence, by moving to (2,5) on turn 14, I am closer to the food row.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nIn sequence A: turn 14 to (2,5), turn 15 to (3,5) eat.\n\nIn sequence B: turn 14 to (3,6), turn 15 to (3,5) eat.\n\nBoth eat on turn 15, but in sequence B, I go to (3,6) which is not on food row, whereas in A, I go to (2,5) which is adjacent to food.\n\nBut no big difference.\n\nHowever, in sequence A, after eating (3,5), I am at (3,5) with direction R, and (4,5) is right there, so I can eat it next turn.\n\nIn sequence B, after eating (3,5) from above, I am at (3,5) with direction D, and to eat (4,5), I need to move R, which is perpendicular, fine.\n\nBut when I move R from (3,5) with direction D, it's allowed, since not reverse.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut in both cases, I can eat (4,5) on turn 16 and (5,5) on turn 17.\n\nNow, after that, I need to move safely.\n\nBut there might be a problem with the obstacle at (5,6).\n\nWhen I am at (5,5) after eating, I cannot go up because (5,6) obstacle.\n\nI can go down to (5,4) or right to (6,5).\n\nIf I go right to (6,5), then from there, I can go down to (6,4) or up to (6,6) but y=6, x=6, (6,6) is free? Walls are x=0,x=7,y=0,y=7, so (6,6) is corner but playable? x=6,y=6, not wall, since walls are at x=7 and y=7.\n\nx=7 and y=7 are walls, so (6,6) is playable.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) is fine.\n\nBut if I go to (6,5), then I might be near the border.\n\nBut let's see the tail; it's at (1,3) or moving slowly.\n\nFor example, when I move to (6,5), the tail might still be at (1, something), so no immediate risk.\n\nBut the grid is small, 6x6 playable area, and snake is getting longer, so I need to avoid trapping myself.\n\nAfter eating three foods, snake length 9, in an 6x6 grid, which has 36 cells, so possible, but need space.\n\nCurrently, after turn 17, positions: head (5,5), body to tail (1,3), but the body is spread.\n\nTo avoid risks, I should not go to corners early.\n\nIn the sequence where I go directly to eat all food, I end up at (5,5) with the snake body behind me.\n\nThen if I move down to (5,4), for example.\n\nBut let's think about the other food or future.\n\nThere is no other food, only these three.\n\nFood positions are given: (3,5), (5,5), (4,5) — all on y=5.\n\nAfter I eat them, no more food, but I need to survive.\n\nThe goal is to maximize score, so eat as much as possible, but here all food will be eaten if I do this sequence.\n\nBut I have to avoid dying.\n\nIn this sequence, I eat all three by turn 17.\n\nThen I need to keep moving without colliding.\n\nFor example, from (5,5) on turn 17, after eating, I move to (5,4) or (6,5).\n\nSuppose I move D to (5,4).\n\nThen head at (5,4), direction D.\n\nPositions: after moving to (5,5) and eating on turn 17, positions: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) — length 9\n\nThen move D to (5,4), no food, so new head (5,4), tail (1,3) removed, so positions: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)\n\nDirection D.\n\nNow from (5,4), possible moves:\n\n- U: (5,5) body, collision\n\n- D: (5,3) free\n\n- L: (4,4) free? Not occupied\n\n- R: (6,4) free\n\nCannot move U, so can move D, L, or R.\n\nSay I move D to (5,3), then to (5,2), etc.\n\nBut the snake body is trailing, and as I move down, the tail is at (1,4), so I have space.\n\nSimilarly, I can go left or right.\n\nBut to avoid walls, since x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\nNow, another thing: the food at (3,5) has short life, so if I don't eat it by turn 16, it disappears.\n\nIn the sequence above, I eat it on turn 15, fine.\n\nBut suppose on turn 14, I move R to (3,6) instead of D to (2,5).\n\nThen on turn 14, move to (3,6), no food.\n\nThen turn 15, move D to (3,5) eat food.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nBut I reach the food at same time.\n\nBut if I delay, I might miss (3,5).\n\nFor example, if on turn 14 from (2,6) I move R to (3,6), and on turn 15 I don't eat, but move elsewhere, but that would be stupid, since food is there.\n\nBut I should eat when possible.\n\nAnother point: the tail reward danger.\n\nCurrently, when I eat the food, the tail is not adjacent, so no problem.\n\nFor example, when I eat (3,5) on turn 15, tail is at (1,3), not adjacent to (3,5).\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut after eating all, I need to survive, but since no more food, I can just move around.\n\nBut the grid has obstacles and walls.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,6), which is above (5,5).\n\nNow, back to the beginning, on turn 13, I must move R.\n\nOn turn 14, I have to choose between moving to (2,5) or to (3,6).\n\nMoving to (2,5) gets me closer to the food row directly.\n\nMoving to (3,6) is one step away.\n\nBut both lead to eating.\n\nHowever, there might be a risk with the obstacle.\n\nSuppose I go to (3,6) on turn 14, then to (3,5) on turn 15 to eat.\n\nThen from (3,5), if I want to go to (4,5), I can move R.\n\nBut if I move to (4,6) instead on turn 16, for example.\n\nBut that might delay eating.\n\nSince I need to think long-term, and all food can be eaten, I should eat them as soon as possible to avoid missing the short-life one.\n\n(3,5) life to turn 16, so I must eat by turn 16.\n\nIn the sequence, eating on turn 15 or 16 is fine.\n\nBut eating earlier might be better.\n\nAnother thing: when I eat (5,5), I am at (5,5), and (5,6) is obstacle, so I cannot go up, which might limit movement.\n\nBut I can go down or right.\n\nFor example, after eating (5,5), if I go down to (5,4), then I can go left or right.\n\nThe body is behind me, so I need to not trap myself.\n\nBut with length 9 in 6x6 grid, it might be tight, but since I start from left, and move right, the tail is on left, so I have space on bottom.\n\nPlayable area: 6x6=36 cells, snake length 9, so 27 free cells, plenty of space.\n\nFor example, from (5,4), I can go to (5,3), (4,4), etc., and gradually move down or left.\n\nTo maximize survival, I should stay away from walls and obstacles.\n\nBut in this case, moving to (2,5) on turn 14 seems fine.\n\nBut let's confirm the move for turn 14.\n\nIn the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe answer format is: for turn t1=13, then t1+1=14, etc., up to some point.\n\nIt says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should provide a sequence of at least 5 turns.\n\nt1=13, so turns 13 to 17 or 18.\n\nBut I need to specify actions.\n\nNow, from above, on turn 13: move R\n\nThen on turn 14, I need to decide.\n\nIf I move D to (2,5), then I can eat on turn 15.\n\nIf I move R to (3,6), I can also eat on turn 15.\n\nBut moving to (2,5) might be better because it is on the food row, so I can immediately go to (3,5).\n\nWhereas from (3,6), I go down to (3,5).\n\nNo big difference.\n\nBut let's see the path to the next food.\n\nAfter eating (3,5), (4,5) is adjacent, so I can go directly.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut there is a potential issue: the internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nIf I am at (4,5) and want to go to (5,5), I can, but (5,6) is blocked, so from (5,5) I cannot go up.\n\nBut I can go down or right.\n\nNow, another thing: on the grid, y=5 is the food row, but above it, y=6 has the obstacle at (5,6), and also the snake was at (1,6), etc.\n\nBut in our sequence, when we move, for example, in the first sequence, after turn 14 to (2,5), then to (3,5), the body includes (2,6), which is above.\n\nBut (2,6) is occupied.\n\nNow, when I go to (4,5), then to (5,5), I am at (5,5).\n\nNow, suppose after eating (5,5), I move R to (6,5) on turn 18.\n\nThen head at (6,5), direction R.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (6,6), D to (6,4), L to (5,5) body, or R to (7,5) wall, invalid.\n\nSo can move U, D, or R but R invalid, so U or D.\n\nSay move D to (6,4), etc.\n\nBut the point is, I can survive.\n\nIf on turn 14 I had moved to (3,6), then after eating (3,5), if I move to (4,6) on turn 16, for example.\n\n(4,6) is at y=6, x=4.\n\nThen from (4,6), I can move to (4,5) to eat on turn 17, but (4,5) is food, so I can eat it.\n\nBut (4,5) has longer life, so I can eat it later.\n\nBut (3,5) must be eaten soon.\n\nIn this case, if on turn 16 I go to (4,6) instead of to (4,5), then (3,5) might disappear if not eaten, but I ate it on turn 15.\n\nIn all cases, I eat (3,5) on turn 15.\n\nThen on turn 16, from (3,5), if I move to (4,6) instead of to (4,5).\n\nBut (4,6) is free? Let's see.\n\nAfter turn 15: ate (3,5), positions (3,5), (2,5) or depending on path.\n\nIf I came from (3,6), positions after eating: head (3,5), then (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) — length 7\n\nDirection D.\n\nThen on turn 16, from (3,5), I can move U to (3,6) but (3,6) is body, collision.\n\nD to (3,4)\n\nL to (2,5) — if I came from above, (2,5) may not be body; in this case, positions: (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)\n\nSo (2,5) is not occupied; it's free.\n\n(2,5) is at x=2,y=5, not in positions.\n\nSimilarly, R to (4,5) food.\n\nSo I can move D, L, or R.\n\nIf I move R to (4,5), eat.\n\nOr move to (4,6), but (4,6) is not adjacent directly; from (3,5), moving to (4,6) is diagonal? No, moves are only U,D,L,R, so adjacent cells.\n\n(4,6) is not adjacent to (3,5); adjacent are (3,6), (3,4), (2,5), (4,5).\n\n(4,6) is not adjacent; it's one step away diagonally, but not reachable directly.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can only go to (3,6), (3,4), (2,5), or (4,5).\n\n(3,6) is body if I came from there, so I cannot go back.\n\nSo options: D to (3,4), L to (2,5), or R to (4,5).\n\nIf I go to (4,5), I eat immediately.\n\nIf I go to (2,5), that might be away.\n\nBut (2,5) could be free, but then I delay eating (4,5).\n\nSince (4,5) has long life, I can eat later, but I need to think about survival.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should eat it when possible.\n\nSimilarly, no reason to delay.\n\nTherefore, in all cases, the best is to eat sequentially.\n\nNow, back to turn 14 choice: moving to (2,5) or to (3,6).\n\nMoving to (2,5) might be slightly better because it gets me to the food row, and I can then go right to eat all.\n\nFrom (3,6), I have to go down to eat, which is fine.\n\nBut let's see the position after.\n\nIf I am at (2,5) on turn 14, then to (3,5) on 15, to (4,5) on 16, to (5,5) on 17.\n\nAfter that, I am at (5,5) with direction R.\n\nThen I can go down to (5,4) on turn 18.\n\nIf I was at (3,6) on turn 14, then to (3,5) on 15, then to (4,5) on 16, to (5,5) on 17, same as above.\n\nSo identical from turn 15 onwards.\n\nThe only difference is on turn 14, whether I go to (2,5) or to (3,6).\n\nNow, (2,5) is at y=5, which is the food row, and (3,6) is at y=6.\n\ny=6 has the obstacle at (5,6), but (3,6) is free.\n\nIn terms of future movement, if I go to (2,5), I am closer to the left, but since I go right, it might not matter.\n\nPerhaps going to (3,6) first might allow me to go to (4,6) later, but (4,6) has no food, so unnecessary.\n\nWhereas (2,5) is adjacent to food.\n\nI think moving to (2,5) on turn 14 is better.\n\nMoreover, in (2,5), I have the option to go down if needed, but I don't.\n\nTherefore, for the sequence:\n\nTurn 13: move R to (2,6)\n\nTurn 14: move D to (2,5)\n\nTurn 15: move R to (3,5) eat food\n\nTurn 16: move R to (4,5) eat food\n\nTurn 17: move R to (5,5) eat food\n\nNow, for turn 18, I need to move from (5,5).\n\nAfter turn 17, head at (5,5), direction R.\n\nCannot move U (obstacle), cannot move L (body), can move D to (5,4) or R to (6,5).\n\nI think moving D to (5,4) is better to go away from the wall.\n\nSince x=6 is close to wall, moving down opens space.\n\nBut I need to provide actions up to turn 17 or 18.\n\nThe answer should include at least 5 turns: from turn 13 to 17.\n\nt1=13, so turns 13,14,15,16,17.\n\nThat's 5 turns.\n\nI can add turn 18 if needed.\n\nBut for now, let's output up to turn 17.\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 17 I eat the last food.\n\nBut the action for turn 17 is move R to (5,5).\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nAlso, I need to consider if there is any risk.\n\nAnother thing: the tail reward danger.\n\nFor example, when I eat food, is the tail adjacent?\n\nIn this case, when I eat (3,5) on turn 15, tail is at (1,3), not adjacent.\n\nSimilarly, on turn 16, when I eat (4,5), tail might be at (1,4) or something, but (1,4) to (4,5) not adjacent.\n\nSimilarly for (5,5), tail at (1,3) or moving; after multiple moves, tail moves.\n\nFor instance, on turn 16, when I move to (4,5), positions before move: after turn 15, positions (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)\n\nMove to (4,5), eat, so new positions: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) — tail (1,3)\n\nHead at (4,5), tail at (1,3), not adjacent.\n\nSimilarly, turn 17, move to (5,5), eat, positions: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) — tail (1,3)\n\nHead (5,5), tail (1,3), far away.\n\nNo issue.\n\nAfter turn 17, if I move to (5,4), tail starts moving.\n\nBut for the sequence, I think it's fine.\n\nNow, what about the initial move? On turn 13, only one choice.\n\nBut let's confirm the walls and obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,6), which we considered.\n\nAlso, borders are walls.\n\nIn the food, all are positive, no negative food mentioned.\n\nSo, I think this plan is good.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 13: R (right)\n\nTurn 14: D (down) to (2,5)\n\nTurn 15: R (right) to (3,5)\n\nTurn 16: R (right) to (4,5)\n\nTurn 17: R (right) to (5,5)\n\nNow, for thinking ahead, I have 5 turns.\n\nTo be complete, I can add turn 18: say move D to (5,4)\n\nBut not necessary.\n\nIn the answer, I should output the actions.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: R\nTurn 14: D\nTurn 15: R\nTurn 16: R\nTurn 17: R\n}\n\nBut I need to specify the direction clearly.\n\nIt says: action \\in {U, D, L, R}\n\nAnd in parentheses, like \"U (up)\" but in answer, probably just the letter.\n\nIn the format, it says \"U (up)\" etc., but in the box, I think just the direction.\n\nLook: \"action on turn t_1\" and \"U (up), D (down), L (left), R (right)\"\n\nBut in the boxed answer, it might be just the letter.\n\nI think for simplicity, I can use the letters.\n\nTo match, perhaps write the full word or just letter.\n\nIn the example, it says \"action on turn t_1\" and in the set, it has \"U (up)\", so I think writing \"R\" for right is fine.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo for turn 13 to 17.\n\nBut turn 17: moving to (5,5), which is food, so eating.\n\nNow, is there any reason to do differently?\n\nSuppose on turn 14 I move to (3,6) instead.\n\nThen turn 14: R to (3,6)\n\nTurn 15: D to (3,5) eat\n\nThen turn 16: from (3,5), I can move R to (4,5) eat, same as before.\n\nThen turn 17 to (5,5).\n\nBut on turn 14, I go to (3,6) which is not necessary, and (3,6) might be closer to the obstacle, but not an issue.\n\nBut moving directly to (2,5) seems more efficient.\n\nMoreover, by going to (2,5), I have the option to not eat immediately, but I do.\n\nSo I think D on turn 14 is better.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is as above.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating all available positive food while ensuring long-term survival, the strategy involves moving the snake to eat the food at (3,5), (4,5), and (5,5) sequentially over the next few turns. Given the snake's initial position at (1,6) and head direction \"U\" (up), the only safe move on turn 13 is right (R) to (2,6), as moving up is blocked by the wall at y=7, moving down is the opposite direction and leads to body collision, and moving left is blocked by the wall at x=0.\n\nOn turn 14, moving down (D) to (2,5) positions the snake to eat the food at (3,5) on turn 15. This is preferable to moving right (R) to (3,6) because it places the snake on the food row (y=5) earlier, reducing unnecessary movement and aligning with the food sequence.\n\nFrom (2,5), moving right (R) to (3,5) on turn 15 eats the first food, increasing the snake length to 7. The food at (3,5) has a life span of 4, meaning it disappears after turn 16, so eating it on turn 15 is timely.\n\nOn turn 16, moving right (R) to (4,5) eats the second food, increasing the length to 8. The food at (4,5) has a long life span (10 turns), but eating it now is efficient.\n\nOn turn 17, moving right (R) to (5,5) eats the third food, increasing the length to 9. The food at (5,5) has a life span of 7, so eating by turn 17 is within its window (disappears after turn 19).\n\nThis sequence eats all food by turn 17, maximizing the score gain of +3. After turn 17, the snake is at (5,5) with direction R. To avoid the obstacle at (5,6) and walls, moving down (D) to (5,4) on turn 18 is safe and opens space for further movement, but the sequence up to turn 17 is provided as per the 5-turn thinking requirement.\n\nNo tail reward danger occurs, as the tail is never adjacent to the head when food is eaten (e.g., on turn 15, tail is at (1,3); on turn 16, at (1,3); on turn 17, at (1,3)—all distant from head positions). Collisions are avoided by not moving into walls, obstacles, or body segments.\n\n**Action Sequence (Turns 13 to 17):**\n- Turn 13: Move right (R) to (2,6) – only safe option.\n- Turn 14: Move down (D) to (2,5) – positions for imminent food access.\n- Turn 15: Move right (R) to (3,5) – eat first food, length +1.\n- Turn 16: Move right (R) to (4,5) – eat second food, length +1.\n- Turn 17: Move right (R) to (5,5) – eat third food, length +1.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: R\nTurn 14: D\nTurn 15: R\nTurn 16: R\nTurn 17: R\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 14, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (5,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but with walls on the borders, meaning I can't go to those cells.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (2,6), then body segments at (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2). So the snake is 6 units long. Head direction is right (R), meaning it was moving right to get to (2,6) from (1,6).\n\nFood items:\n\n- (3,5) with life span 3, value +1\n\n- (5,5) with life span 6, value +1\n\n- (4,5) with life span 9, value +1\n\nAll food has value +1, so no negative food here. Life span decreases each turn, including this one, so I need to consider that.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nPossible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1). Since head direction is R, I cannot move left immediately because that would be an instant reverse. So for turn 14, I can move U, D, or R, but not L.\n\nCurrent head position: (2,6)\n\nPossible actions for turn 14:\n\n- U: to (2,7)\n\n- D: to (2,5)\n\n- R: to (3,6)\n\n- L: to (1,6), but (1,6) is the first body segment, and I cannot move there because it's occupied. Also, moving left would be opposite to current direction R, so it's invalid anyway. So only U, D, R are possible, but I have to check if the cells are safe.\n\nCheck cells:\n\n- (2,7): y=7 is a border wall, so I can't go there. Wall collision.\n\n- (2,5): is this free? Snake positions are (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), etc. (2,5) is not listed, so it should be empty. No wall at y=5 except borders, but y=5 is between 0 and 7, not border. Borders are y=0 and y=7, so y=5 is fine. x=2 is between 0 and 7.\n\n- (3,6): not occupied by snake, and no wall. Walls are only borders and (5,6), so (3,6) should be free.\n\nAlso, food is at (3,5), (5,5), (4,5), all at y=5, x=3,4,5.\n\nNow, moving to (2,5) or (3,6) both seem possible.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nFirst, let's list the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: all cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Also, internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nSo accessible cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (5,6) is blocked.\n\nx=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, but (5,6) is occupied by obstacle, so not accessible.\n\nNow snake: head (2,6), body: (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2). So the tail is at (1,2).\n\nFood: (3,5), (5,5), (4,5) — all at y=5, x=3,4,5 with value +1 and life spans 3,6,9 respectively.\n\nLife span decreases each turn, so for turn 14, life spans are as given. After turn 14, they decrease by 1 each turn.\n\nTurn 14: food life spans: (3,5):3, (5,5):6, (4,5):9\n\nAfter turn 14, if not eaten, (3,5) life span becomes 2, then 1, then 0 and disappears. Similarly for others.\n\nI need to plan moves for multiple turns, but the answer should start from turn 14 action.\n\nThe output should be a sequence of actions for turns starting from t1=14.\n\nBut I don't know how many turns to output; it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but the answer format is to list actions for several turns, like Turn 14: action, Turn 15: action, etc. It doesn't specify how many, but since I need to think ahead, I should plan a sequence.\n\nBut the future depends on what happens, like if I eat food, snake grows, etc. So I need to simulate based on my actions.\n\nAlso, food life spans decrease, and new food might spawn? No, the state only gives current food, and I think no new food spawns unless specified, but here it's not mentioned, so probably only these food exist until eaten or expired.\n\nThe problem doesn't say anything about new food spawning, so I think only these three food are present.\n\nNow, for turn 14, possible moves from (2,6):\n\n- U: to (2,7) — but (2,7) is y=7, wall, invalid.\n\n- D: to (2,5) — (2,5) is free? Let's see: snake is at (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), etc. (2,5) is not occupied, and not wall. y=5, x=2, not border. So free. But there is food at (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), not at (2,5). So moving to (2,5) doesn't eat food.\n\n- R: to (3,6) — (3,6) is free? x=3,y=6, not wall, not occupied by snake. Yes.\n\nNow, (3,6) has no food; food is at y=5.\n\nIf I move R to (3,6), no food eaten.\n\nIf I move D to (2,5), no food eaten.\n\nBut I need to get to the food.\n\nFood at (3,5) has life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns including this one? Life span decreases each turn, starting from current turn.\n\nLife span N means it disappears after N turns, including the current turn if not eaten.\n\nSo for (3,5), life span 3 at turn 14: it will be there for turn 14,15,16, and disappear at turn 17 or after turn 16?\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo at turn 14, life span 3, so after turn 14, life span 2; after turn 15, life span 1; after turn 16, life span 0, so it disappears before turn 17 or at the start of turn 17? I need to clarify.\n\nTypically, \"disappears after N turns\" might mean after N turns from now, so if N=3 at turn t, it exists at t, t+1, t+2, gone at t+3.\n\nBut with countdown decreasing including current turn.\n\nAssume that at the start of turn t, the life span is L. After the turn, if not eaten, L decreases by 1. When L=0, it disappears before the next turn.\n\nSo for (3,5) at turn 14, L=3. After turn 14, if not eaten, L=2. After turn 15, L=1. After turn 16, L=0, so it disappears and is not available on turn 17.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) L=6: exists until after turn 14+5=19? Turn 14 L=6, after turn 14 L=5, ..., after turn 19 L=0, gone on turn 20.\n\nTurn 14: L=6, after turn 14: L=5, after turn 15: L=4, ..., after turn 19: L=0, so not available on turn 20.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) L=9: exists until after turn 22 L=0.\n\nNow, back to turn 14 actions.\n\nPossible moves: D to (2,5) or R to (3,6). U is invalid.\n\nMoving to (2,5): then head at (2,5), direction down? Since moved D.\n\nCurrent direction is R, moving D changes direction to D.\n\nThen snake positions: new head (2,5), then the body: since snake moves, the tail moves forward, so segments: after moving to (2,5), the head is (2,5), then previous head (2,6) becomes body, then (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), and tail (1,2) is removed since no food eaten. Snake length unchanged.\n\nSimilarly, if move R to (3,6), head (3,6), body (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), tail (1,2) removed.\n\nNow, from (2,5) or (3,6), I can plan to eat food.\n\nThe food at (3,5) is close, with short life span.\n\n(3,5) is adjacent to (2,5) and (3,6).\n\nFrom (2,5), I can move R to (3,5) to eat it.\n\nFrom (3,6), I can move D to (3,5) to eat it.\n\nBut I need to consider the turn it can be eaten.\n\nAlso, there's a risk: tail reward danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut currently, tail is at (1,2), which is far from head. Head at (2,6), tail at (1,2), not adjacent.\n\nAfter moves, tail might move.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving to (2,5) on turn 14.\n\nTurn 14: move D to (2,5)\n\nThen snake positions: head (2,5), body (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) — tail is (1,3) now? Let's list:\n\nAfter move: new head at (2,5), then the previous positions: the body segments follow. The snake was [(2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)] with head (2,6).\n\nAfter moving down to (2,5), new head is (2,5), then the first body segment is the previous head (2,6), then (1,6), then (1,5), but (1,5) is occupied, but it's part of the body. When the snake moves, all segments shift, so the tail is removed.\n\nNew positions: head (2,5), then body: (2,6) [previous head], then (1,6) [previous first body], then (1,5) [previous second body], then (1,4) [previous third], then (1,3) [previous fourth, now tail]. The previous tail (1,2) is gone.\n\nSnake length 6, no food eaten, so tail is removed.\n\nSo positions: [(2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)]\n\nTail at (1,3)\n\nNow, at turn 15, from (2,5), head direction is D (since moved down).\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse to U, because current direction D, so cannot move U (up).\n\nReversing would be opposite direction. From down, moving up is reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo can move D (down), L (left), R (right).\n\nCells:\n\n- D to (2,4) — y=4, free? Not wall, not occupied. Occupied by snake? Positions: (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3). (2,4) not listed, so free.\n\n- L to (1,5) — (1,5) is occupied by body segment, cannot move there.\n\n- R to (3,5) — (3,5) has food, and it's free? Not occupied by snake. Yes, and food present.\n\nSo from (2,5), I can move R to (3,5) to eat the food.\n\nIf I do that on turn 15, I eat (3,5) which has value +1.\n\nThen snake grows: head moves to (3,5), and tail does not move, so new positions: head (3,5), then (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), and tail (1,3) stays because length increases. Since food eaten, snake grows, so the tail is not removed; instead, a new segment is added at head, but actually, the head moves to new position, and the tail stays, so length increases by one.\n\nStandard snake: when food eaten, head moves to food cell, and a new body segment is added at the previous tail position or something? I need to clarify.\n\nTypically in snake, when you eat food, you move to the food cell, and the tail doesn't advance, so the snake grows by one cell.\n\nPositions: new head at food, then previous head, then body, and tail remains.\n\nFor example, before eating: positions [head, body..., tail]\n\nAfter eating: new head at food cell, then previous head, then body..., tail, so the tail is still there, length increased.\n\nIn this case, from turn 14 end: positions [(2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)] tail (1,3)\n\nThen move to (3,5) and eat: new head (3,5), then previous head (2,5), then (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), and tail (1,3) still, so positions: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)] length 7.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, (3,5) has life span 3 at turn 14, but eaten on turn 15, which is after turn 14, so life span should be checked at the time of move.\n\nAt turn 15, before move, life span of (3,5) is 2 (since decreased after turn 14).\n\nAt turn 14 start, L=3 for (3,5).\n\nAfter turn 14, if not eaten, L decreases to 2.\n\nThen at turn 15, if eaten during turn 15 move, it is eaten before L decreases again? I need to define the order.\n\nProbably, during a turn, the snake moves, and if it moves to a food cell, it eats it. Life span decreases at the end of the turn if not eaten.\n\nAssume: at the start of turn, life span is current. Snake moves to a cell. If that cell has food, it eats it and grows. Then, for uneaten food, life span decreases by 1.\n\nSo for (3,5) at turn 14 start, L=3.\n\nIf not eaten on turn 14, at end of turn, L=2.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn turn 14, if I move to (3,6), no food there, so not eaten. Then after turn, L for (3,5) becomes 2.\n\nIf on turn 15 I move to (3,5), I eat it when L=2.\n\nBack to planning.\n\nAnother option: on turn 14, move R to (3,6)\n\nThen positions: head (3,6), body (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) tail (1,3)? After move: new head (3,6), previous head (2,6) becomes body, then (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), and tail (1,2) removed. Positions: [(3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)] tail (1,3)\n\nHead direction now R (since moved right).\n\nThen turn 15, from (3,6), can move U, D, L, R? Cannot reverse, but current direction R, so cannot move L (left).\n\nPossible:\n\n- U to (3,7) — y=7 wall, invalid.\n\n- D to (3,5) — (3,5) has food, free? Not occupied, yes.\n\n- R to (4,6) — (4,6) free? x=4,y=6, not wall, not occupied, yes. But no food there.\n\n- L to (2,6) — but (2,6) is body segment, cannot move there.\n\nSo can move D to (3,5) to eat food, or R to (4,6).\n\nIf move D to (3,5) on turn 15, eat (3,5) with L=2 at that time.\n\nNow, comparing the two options for turn 14:\n\n- If move D to (2,5) on turn 14, then on turn 15 move R to (3,5) to eat.\n\n- If move R to (3,6) on turn 14, then on turn 15 move D to (3,5) to eat.\n\nIn both cases, I can eat (3,5) on turn 15.\n\nBut in the first case, after turn 14, I am at (2,5), and in second at (3,6).\n\nNow, after eating (3,5), the snake is longer, and I need to consider other food.\n\nThere is also food at (4,5) and (5,5).\n\n(4,5) has L=9, plenty of time, (5,5) L=6.\n\nBut obstacle at (5,6), which is above (5,5).\n\nNow, let's think about the tail reward danger.\n\nAfter eating (3,5), snake is longer.\n\nBut tail is at (1,3) or something, not near head.\n\nNow, I need to plan beyond that.\n\nPerhaps I should go for the food with shortest life first, which is (3,5) with L=3 at turn 14.\n\nSince I can eat it on turn 15, that should be fine.\n\nBut let's see if I can eat it on turn 14.\n\nOn turn 14, from (2,6), can I move directly to (3,5)? No, because (3,5) is not adjacent to (2,6); adjacent cells are (2,7) wall, (2,5), (3,6), (1,6) body.\n\n(3,5) is diagonal? No, adjacent means up, down, left, right, not diagonal. So from (2,6), (3,5) is not adjacent; it's down-right, but not a direct move. I can only move to adjacent cells in one step.\n\nSo to reach (3,5), I need to be at (3,6) or (2,5) or (3,4) etc., but (3,4) is not adjacent directly.\n\nFrom (2,6), I can only go to (2,5) or (3,6) this turn.\n\nBoth allow me to reach (3,5) next turn.\n\nNow, which one to choose for turn 14?\n\nIf I move to (2,5) on turn 14, I am closer to other food at y=5.\n\nFood at (4,5) and (5,5) are also at y=5.\n\nIf I move to (3,6) on turn 14, I am at y=6, which is closer to the obstacle at (5,6).\n\nBut let's think about the path to other food.\n\nFirst, after eating (3,5), I need to go to (4,5) or (5,5).\n\n(5,5) has shorter life span (L=6) than (4,5) L=9, but both have time.\n\nL=6 at turn 14, so it will be around for 6 turns, including turn 14, so until turn 19.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) until turn 22.\n\nBut I should eat (5,5) first since shorter life.\n\n(5,5) is at x=5,y=5.\n\nThere is an obstacle at (5,6), so I need to approach from below or sides.\n\nAlso, the grid has walls.\n\nNow, let's consider the two scenarios.\n\nScenario 1: Turn 14 move D to (2,5)\n\nThen positions: [(2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)] head dir D\n\nTurn 15: move R to (3,5) to eat food. Since (3,5) has food, eat it.\n\nAfter move: new head (3,5), then (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) — tail (1,3) stays, length 7.\n\nHead direction now R (since moved right).\n\nFood (3,5) eaten, removed.\n\nOther food: (5,5) L=6 at turn 14, after turn 14 L=5, after turn 15 L=4? Let's track life spans.\n\nTurn 14 start: (3,5) L=3, (5,5) L=6, (4,5) L=9\n\nAfter turn 14: (3,5) not eaten, L=2; (5,5) not eaten, L=5; (4,5) L=8\n\nAfter turn 15: (3,5) eaten, so removed; (5,5) L=4; (4,5) L=7? At start of turn 15, before move, life spans: (3,5) L=2, (5,5) L=5, (4,5) L=8? No.\n\nAt start of turn 15, after turn 14 end:\n\nAfter turn 14, uneaten food: (3,5) L=2 (since decreased from 3), (5,5) L=5 (from 6), (4,5) L=8 (from 9).\n\nThen during turn 15, if I eat (3,5), it is removed.\n\nThen after turn 15, for uneaten food, L decreases: (5,5) L=4, (4,5) L=7.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow back to positions after turn 15: head at (3,5), body: (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)\n\nNow turn 16, from (3,5), head direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R? Cannot reverse to L (left), since dir R.\n\nSo can move U, D, R.\n\nCells:\n\n- U to (3,6) — (3,6) free? Not occupied, not wall. Yes.\n\n- D to (3,4) — (3,4) free? Not occupied, not wall. y=4, x=3.\n\n- R to (4,5) — (4,5) has food! And free.\n\n(4,5) is adjacent, and has food.\n\nI can move directly to (4,5) on turn 16 to eat it.\n\nIf I do that, eat (4,5) with L=8 at that time? At start of turn 16, life spans: after turn 15, (5,5) L=4, (4,5) L=7.\n\nStart of turn 16: (5,5) L=4, (4,5) L=7\n\nIf I move to (4,5) and eat it.\n\nThen snake grows: head (4,5), then (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) — tail (1,3), length 8.\n\nHead direction now R.\n\nNow, still (5,5) to eat.\n\nTurn 17, from (4,5), head dir R.\n\nCan move U, D, R? Cannot L.\n\n- U to (4,6) — free? x=4,y=6, not wall, not occupied? Positions: head (4,5), body (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3). (4,6) not occupied, no wall. But obstacle at (5,6), not (4,6).\n\n- D to (4,4) — free\n\n- R to (5,5) — (5,5) has food, and free? Not occupied, yes.\n\nSo I can move R to (5,5) to eat it on turn 17.\n\nThen eat (5,5) with L=4 at start of turn 17? Start turn 17: after turn 16, uneaten food L decreases.\n\nAfter turn 16: if (5,5) not eaten, L decreases to 3? Start turn 16: (5,5) L=4\n\nIf not eaten on turn 16, after turn 16, L=3.\n\nBut if I eat on turn 17, at start turn 17 L=3.\n\nAnyway, I can eat it.\n\nIn this sequence, I eat all three food quickly.\n\nNow, the other scenario: if on turn 14 I move R to (3,6)\n\nThen positions: [(3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)] head dir R\n\nTurn 15: move D to (3,5) to eat (3,5)\n\nAfter move: new head (3,5), then (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) — tail (1,3), length 7\n\nHead direction D (since moved down)\n\nNow turn 16, from (3,5), head dir D.\n\nPossible moves: cannot reverse to U, so can move D, L, R.\n\n- D to (3,4) — free\n\n- L to (2,5) — free? (2,5) not occupied, yes\n\n- R to (4,5) — has food\n\nI can move R to (4,5) to eat it, similar to before.\n\nThen eat (4,5) on turn 16.\n\nThen positions: head (4,5), then (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) length 8\n\nHead dir R\n\nThen turn 17, from (4,5), can move to (5,5) to eat, but (5,5) is at (5,5), adjacent.\n\nMove R to (5,5)\n\nBut (5,5) is adjacent, but there is obstacle at (5,6), which is above.\n\n(5,5) is free, I can move there.\n\nBut after eating, I need to avoid collision.\n\nIn both cases, I end up eating all food around turn 15,16,17.\n\nBut in the first sequence, when I move D on turn 14 to (2,5), then R to (3,5) on 15, then R to (4,5) on 16, then R to (5,5) on 17.\n\nIn the second sequence, move R to (3,6) on 14, D to (3,5) on 15, then R to (4,5) on 16, then R to (5,5) on 17.\n\nSimilar, but the first sequence has me at (2,5) after turn 14, which is closer to the left, but I move right.\n\nNow, what about the tail reward danger? In both cases, when I eat (4,5) or (5,5), the tail is at (1,3) or something, far away, not adjacent, so no problem.\n\nBut let's check for (5,5).\n\nAfter eating (5,5), the snake head is at (5,5), and the tail might be somewhere.\n\nBut in the sequence, after eating (5,5), the tail is still at (1,3), not adjacent.\n\nMoreover, (5,5) is not under the tail; the tail is elsewhere.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut there is a potential problem with the obstacle.\n\nAfter I am at (5,5), head at (5,5), direction R.\n\nThen I need to move away.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,6) — but (5,6) is obstacle, wall, cannot move there.\n\nD to (5,4) — free\n\nL to (4,5) — but (4,5) is body segment now, since I just came from there? After moving to (5,5) and eating, positions: head (5,5), then previous head (4,5), then (3,5), etc., so (4,5) is body, cannot move back.\n\nR to (6,5) — x=6, but x=6 is not wall? Walls are x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is not wall, y=5, so (6,5) should be free? But borders: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to 6 are ok, y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 to 6 ok.\n\nBut internal obstacle only (5,6).\n\nSo (6,5) is free.\n\nBut in the sequence, after eating (5,5), I am at (5,5), and (4,5) is body, so cannot move left to (4,5).\n\nCan move down to (5,4) or right to (6,5).\n\nOr up to (5,6) but obstacle.\n\nSo possible D or R.\n\nSimilarly, in the earlier path, when I go to (5,5), I can move D or R.\n\nNow, but I need to think about survival; after eating all food, I need to not die.\n\nBut since no more food, I can just move safely.\n\nBut in this case, with the snake long, I might have space issues.\n\nBut the grid is 6x6 accessible, minus obstacle.\n\nAccessible cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (5,6) blocked, so 36 - 1 = 35 cells.\n\nSnake is 6 long, after eating three food, length 9, so still space.\n\nBut I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nIn the first sequence, when I move to (2,5) on turn 14, I am near the left wall.\n\nBut I move right, so it should be fine.\n\nNow, back to turn 14 choice.\n\nIf I move D to (2,5), then on turn 15 I eat (3,5), then turn 16 eat (4,5), turn 17 eat (5,5).\n\nSimilarly, if I move R to (3,6) on turn 14, then turn 15 eat (3,5), turn 16 I can eat (4,5), turn 17 eat (5,5).\n\nBut when I am at (3,6) after turn 14, and I move D to (3,5) on turn 15, I am at (3,5) with dir D.\n\nThen on turn 16, I can move R to (4,5) to eat.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in this case, when I move from (3,6) to (3,5), I go down, but (3,5) is below, no issue.\n\nIs there any difference?\n\nOne thing: in the first sequence, after turn 14 at (2,5), I am closer to the tail or something, but tail is at (1,3), not adjacent.\n\n(2,5) and (1,5) is body, but not head adjacent to tail.\n\nAnother point: the food at (4,5) and (5,5) might be under the snake body? But in this case, not, they are free.\n\nBut the rule says food can spawn under body, but here they are not, so can be eaten directly.\n\nNow, but I need to think about the life span of (3,5); if I don't eat it soon, it disappears.\n\nBut in both cases, I eat it on turn 15.\n\nPerhaps I can eat it on turn 14 if possible, but I can't from (2,6).\n\nAnother idea: is there a way to eat multiple food faster?\n\nFor example, if I go to (3,6) on turn 14, then on turn 15 to (3,5), eat (3,5), then on turn 16 to (4,5), eat (4,5), turn 17 to (5,5), same as before.\n\nIf on turn 14 I move to (2,5), then to (3,5) on 15, etc.\n\nBut when I move to (2,5) on turn 14, the cell (2,5) might have been under body? Let's see.\n\nBefore turn 14, snake positions: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2)\n\n(2,5) is not occupied; it was free.\n\nAfter I move to (2,5), it is head.\n\nNo issue.\n\nPerhaps I should consider not eating (3,5) immediately, but that might be risky since it disappears soon.\n\nLife span 3, I eat on turn 15, L=2, still available.\n\nBut if I skip it, it might be gone.\n\nBut I can eat it, so better to eat.\n\nNow, about the answer: I need to output a sequence of actions.\n\nBut how many turns? Since I think 5+ turns ahead, I should plan for several turns.\n\nAlso, after eating all food, I need to survive.\n\nBut the problem is to maximize score, so eating all food is good.\n\nIn this case, with the sequences above, I can eat all three.\n\nBut let's confirm the grid and obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,6), which might block access to (5,5) from above.\n\nBut I approach from left, so no problem.\n\nNow, another thing: when I eat (5,5), I am at (5,5), and I need to move away.\n\nAs I said, can move down to (5,4) or right to (6,5).\n\nSuppose I move right to (6,5), then I am near the right wall.\n\nBut I can move up, down, left, etc., but need to avoid walls and body.\n\nBut since the snake is long, I might have less space.\n\nBut with 35 cells and snake length 9, 26 free cells, plenty.\n\nBut I should have a path.\n\nSince I need to output actions, let's define a sequence.\n\nFirst, for turn 14, I need to choose between D and R.\n\nIn terms of long-term, moving to (2,5) might be better because I am at y=5, same row as food, so I can go right directly to eat the others.\n\nIf I go to (3,6), I am at y=6, then I go down to y=5, but same thing.\n\nBut when I am at (3,6), the obstacle (5,6) is to the right, so if I want to go to (5,5), I have to go down first, not directly right.\n\nFrom (3,6), I can go right to (4,6), then (5,6) but obstacle, cannot, so from (4,6), I can go down to (4,5), then to (5,5).\n\nBut in my earlier sequence, I went down directly to (3,5) first.\n\nSimilarly, after eating (3,5), I go to (4,5).\n\nNow, if I move to (3,6) on turn 14, and on turn 15 I don't eat (3,5), but go to (4,6), for example.\n\nBut (3,5) has short life, so better to eat it.\n\nSuppose turn 14 move R to (3,6)\n\nTurn 15, instead of moving D to (3,5), I move R to (4,6)\n\nThen positions: head (4,6), body (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) tail (1,4)? After move: new head (4,6), previous head (3,6) body, then (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), tail (1,3) removed? Length 6, no food, so tail removed.\n\nPositions: [(4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)]\n\nNow, (3,5) not eaten, at start turn 15 L=2, after turn 15, if not eaten, L=1, then after turn 16 L=0 gone.\n\nBut I can still eat it on turn 16 if I go to (3,5).\n\nFrom (4,6), head dir R.\n\nTurn 16, can move U, D, L, R? Cannot reverse to L.\n\n- U to (4,7) wall invalid\n\n- D to (4,5) — (4,5) has food, free? Yes, I can move D to (4,5) and eat it.\n\nThen I eat (4,5) on turn 16, but (3,5) is not eaten yet, L=1 at start turn 16.\n\nAfter eating (4,5), positions: head (4,5), then (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) — tail (1,4), length 7.\n\nHead dir D.\n\nNow, (3,5) is at L=1, I can go to eat it on turn 17.\n\nFrom (4,5), move L to (3,5)? (3,5) is adjacent, and free? Not occupied, yes.\n\nMove L to (3,5), eat it.\n\nThen positions: head (3,5), then (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) — tail (1,4), length 8.\n\nBut I ate (4,5) before (3,5), but (3,5) was about to disappear.\n\nNow, I still have (5,5) to eat.\n\nThen turn 18, from (3,5), head dir L? After moving left, direction L.\n\nCan move U, D, L? Cannot R.\n\n- U to (3,6) — but (3,6) is body segment, cannot move there.\n\n- D to (3,4) — free\n\n- L to (2,5) — free? (2,5) not occupied, yes.\n\nBut I need to go to (5,5), which is to the right.\n\nFrom (3,5), I cannot move right because it would be reverse? Current direction L, so cannot move R.\n\nSo I have to move U, D, or L, but U to (3,6) is body, invalid; L to (2,5) or D to (3,4).\n\nThen I am moving away from (5,5).\n\nFor example, move L to (2,5), then I am at (2,5), and (5,5) is far.\n\nAnd (5,5) might disappear soon.\n\nL=6 at turn 14, after turn 14 L=5, turn 15 L=4, turn 16 L=3, turn 17 L=2, turn 18 L=1, etc.\n\nAt turn 18, L=1 for (5,5)? Start turn 14 L=6, after turn 14 L=5, start turn 15 L=5? No:\n\nTurn 14 start: L=6 for (5,5)\n\nAfter turn 14: if not eaten, L=5\n\nStart turn 15: L=5\n\nAfter turn 15: not eaten, L=4\n\nStart turn 16: L=4\n\nAfter turn 16: not eaten, L=3\n\nStart turn 17: L=3\n\nAfter turn 17: not eaten, L=2\n\nStart turn 18: L=2\n\nAfter turn 18: L=1\n\n Etc.\n\nIn this sequence, at turn 17, I am at (3,5), and (5,5) is at (5,5), I need to go there but I cannot move right directly.\n\nI can move down to (3,4), then right, but it might take more turns.\n\nFor example, from (3,5) on turn 17, move D to (3,4)\n\nThen positions: head (3,4), body (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) tail (1,5)? Length 8, no food eaten, tail removed? After move to (3,4), new head (3,4), previous head (3,5) body, then (4,5), (4,6), etc., tail (1,5) removed? Positions: [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)] but length should be 8, from above: after eating (3,5) on turn 17, positions: [(3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)] tail (1,4)\n\nThen move to (3,4): new head (3,4), then (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) — tail (1,4) removed, so positions [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)] length 8.\n\nHead dir D.\n\nThen turn 18, from (3,4), can move U, D, L, R? Cannot U reverse.\n\nSo move D, L, R.\n\n- D to (3,3) — free\n\n- L to (2,4) — free\n\n- R to (4,4) — free\n\nNo food, and I need to go to (5,5).\n\nThen I can move R to (4,4), for example.\n\nThen to (5,4), then to (5,5) on turn 19 or 20.\n\nBut (5,5) L=2 at start turn 18? Start turn 18: after turn 17, (5,5) L=2 (since after turn 17 L=2 if not eaten)\n\nStart turn 18: L=2\n\nIf I eat on turn 19, L=1, or turn 20 L=0 gone.\n\nBut I can reach by turn 19.\n\nFrom (3,4) turn 18 move R to (4,4)\n\nThen positions: head (4,4), body (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6) tail (1,6)? Tail removed, positions [(4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6)] length 8? After move, new head (4,4), previous head (3,4) body, then (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), and tail (1,5) removed? Previous positions before move: [(3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)] so after move to (4,4), new head (4,4), then (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6) — tail (1,5) removed, positions [(4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6)] length 8.\n\nHead dir R.\n\nThen turn 19, can move U, D, R? Cannot L.\n\n- U to (4,5) — but (4,5) is body segment, cannot.\n\n- D to (4,3) — free\n\n- R to (5,4) — free, (5,4) not occupied.\n\nMove R to (5,4)\n\nThen positions: head (5,4), body (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6) tail (2,6)? Tail (1,6) removed, positions [(5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6)] length 8.\n\nHead dir R.\n\nThen turn 20, from (5,4), can move U to (5,5) — (5,5) has food, free? Not occupied, yes. Eat (5,5) if still there.\n\nStart turn 20: (5,5) L= ? After turn 19: if not eaten, L decreases to ? Start turn 18 L=2, after turn 18 not eaten L=1, start turn 19 L=1, after turn 19 not eaten L=0, gone. So on turn 20, (5,5) not available.\n\nAt start turn 19: (5,5) L=1 (after turn 18 decrease)\n\nIf not eaten on turn 19, after turn 19 L=0, gone.\n\nBut on turn 19, I moved to (5,4), not to (5,5), so not eaten.\n\nThen on turn 20, (5,5) gone.\n\nI missed eating (5,5).\n\nIf on turn 19 from (5,4), I could move U to (5,5), but at turn 19, (5,5) L=1, so if I move to it, I eat it.\n\nFrom (4,4) on turn 19? Turn 19: I was at (4,4) at end of turn 18? Turn 18 end: positions after move to (4,4), but I moved to (5,4) on turn 19.\n\nAt start of turn 19, I am at (4,4), head dir R.\n\nI can move U to (4,5), but (4,5) is body, cannot.\n\nOnly D or R.\n\nI moved R to (5,4).\n\nI could move D to (4,3), but that doesn't help.\n\nThen from (5,4) on turn 20, (5,5) is gone.\n\nSo I failed to eat (5,5).\n\nTherefore, in this alternative path where I delay eating (3,5), I might miss (5,5) or make it tight.\n\nWhereas in the first sequence, I eat all by turn 17.\n\nTherefore, it's better to eat (3,5) as soon as possible.\n\nSimilarly, for turn 14, moving to (2,5) or (3,6) both allow eating (3,5) on turn 15.\n\nBut moving to (2,5) might be slightly better because I am at y=5, so I can go right directly to eat the others without going up and down.\n\nIn the (3,6) case, when I go down to (3,5), I change direction, but not a big deal.\n\nBut to be consistent, let's choose one.\n\nAlso, I need to output a sequence.\n\nSince the head direction matters for reverse move.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I think moving D on turn 14 is fine.\n\nThen actions:\n\nTurn 14: D (down to (2,5))\n\nThen turn 15: R (right to (3,5), eat food)\n\nThen turn 16: R (right to (4,5), eat food)\n\nThen turn 17: R (right to (5,5), eat food)\n\nNow, after that, on turn 17, after moving to (5,5) and eating, positions: head (5,5), body (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) — since length 9 after three eats.\n\nInitial length 6, eat three, length 9.\n\nPositions after turn 17: head (5,5), then (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)\n\nHead direction R.\n\nNow, turn 18, from (5,5), cannot move left to (4,5) body, cannot move up to (5,6) obstacle.\n\nCan move down to (5,4) or right to (6,5).\n\nSuppose I move R to (6,5)\n\nThen positions: head (6,5), body (5,5), (4,5), etc., tail (1,3) removed? No, no food, so tail removed.\n\nNew positions: [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)] tail (1,4)\n\nHead dir R.\n\nThen turn 19, from (6,5), near right wall, x=6, x=7 is wall.\n\nCan move U, D, L? Cannot R to (7,5) wall.\n\n- U to (6,6) — free? (6,6) not wall, not occupied? Yes.\n\n- D to (6,4) — free\n\n- L to (5,5) — body, cannot.\n\nSo move U to (6,6) or D to (6,4).\n\nSay move U to (6,6)\n\nThen and so on, I can survive.\n\nBut since no more food, I just need to avoid dying.\n\nIn the sequence, I have actions up to turn 17 for eating, but I need to output multiple turns.\n\nThe answer format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I should output for several turns, say 5 turns.\n\nt1=14, so turns 14 to 18 or so.\n\nIn my sequence:\n\nTurn 14: D\n\nTurn 15: R\n\nTurn 16: R\n\nTurn 17: R\n\nThen turn 18: from (5,5), I need to move, say D or R.\n\nIf I move R to (6,5), as above.\n\nThen turn 19: from (6,5), move U to (6,6) or D to (6,4).\n\nBut I don't need to specify beyond, but for the output, I can do up to turn 18 or 19.\n\nSince thinking ahead 5 turns, from turn 14 to 18 is 5 turns.\n\nturns 14,15,16,17,18: 5 actions.\n\nNow, for turn 18, I need to choose.\n\nTo be safe, after (5,5), moving down to (5,4) might be better because I can go left or down, avoiding the corner.\n\nBut moving right to (6,5) is also fine.\n\nLet's see the grid.\n\nAfter at (5,5), move D to (5,4)\n\nThen positions: head (5,4), body (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) tail (1,4) removed? After move: new head (5,4), previous head (5,5) body, then (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), and tail (1,4) removed, positions [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)] length 8? No, after eating (5,5) on turn 17, length 9, then move to (5,4), no food, so tail removed, length 8.\n\nPositions: head (5,4), then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) — tail (1,4) gone.\n\nHead dir D.\n\nThen I can move to other areas.\n\nBut for the sequence, I can output the eating part.\n\nNow, back to turn 14, I think moving D is fine.\n\nBut let's confirm the direction constraint.\n\nCurrent head direction R, moving D is allowed, not reverse.\n\nSimilarly, moving R is allowed.\n\nBut moving to (2,5) might be better because if I move to (3,6), and then to (3,5), but (3,5) might be under body? Before moving, (3,5) is free.\n\nIn the state, food is given, not under body.\n\nRule says food can spawn under body, but here it's given in the list, so it's present.\n\nIn this case, all food are on free cells.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps moving to (2,5) is slightly better as it keeps me on the food row.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 14: D (down to (2,5))\n\nTurn 15: R (right to (3,5), eat)\n\nTurn 16: R (right to (4,5), eat)\n\nTurn 17: R (right to (5,5), eat)\n\nNow for turn 18, I need to move from (5,5).\n\nTo output, I can add turn 18 action, say move D to (5,4) or R to (6,5).\n\nSay move D to (5,4) to go down.\n\nThen turn 19, from (5,4), can move L, R, D, etc.\n\nBut I think for the answer, up to turn 18 is fine, since 5 turns: 14 to 18.\n\nt1=14, turns 14,15,16,17,18: 5 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, turn 18 is after eating.\n\nTo be precise, let's write the actions.\n\nAlso, in turn 17, moving to (5,5), is there any risk? Tail at (1,3), not adjacent.\n\nAnd (5,5) not under tail.\n\nSo safe.\n\nTherefore, the sequence:\n\nTurn 14: D\n\nTurn 15: R\n\nTurn 16: R\n\nTurn 17: R\n\nTurn 18: D  (for example, down to (5,4))\n\nBut I need to specify the action.\n\nIn the format, it should be like \"U (up)\" etc.\n\nNow, for the boxed answer.\n\nBut let's make sure about the life spans.\n\n(3,5) eaten on turn 15, when L=2 (at start turn 15 L=2, eaten during turn)\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) eaten turn 16, start L=7? Earlier calculation.\n\nTurn 14 start: (4,5) L=9\n\nAfter turn 14: not eaten, L=8\n\nStart turn 15: L=8\n\nAfter turn 15: not eaten, L=7 (since (4,5) not eaten on turn 15)\n\nOn turn 16, eaten when L=7.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) turn 14 start L=6, after turn 14 L=5, turn 15 L=4, turn 16 L=3, turn 17 eaten L=3.\n\nAll good.\n\nIf I had moved differently, I might miss some.\n\nSo this sequence is efficient.\n\nTherefore, I think it's fine.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating all positive food while ensuring long-term survival, the plan is to prioritize eating the food with the shortest remaining life span first (i.e., (3,5) with life span 3 at turn 14). The sequence of actions is designed to efficiently consume (3,5) by turn 15, then proceed to eat (4,5) and (5,5) in subsequent turns. After eating all food, the snake moves downward from (5,5) to avoid the obstacle at (5,6) and the right wall, ensuring it stays in open space for survival.\n\n### Key Considerations for the Plan:\n- **Turn 14 Action**: From the starting position (2,6) with head direction right (R), moving down (D) to (2,5) is chosen over right (R) to (3,6) because it positions the snake on the same row (y=5) as all food items, enabling a direct path to eat them sequentially with minimal turns. Moving up (U) is invalid due to the wall at y=7, and moving left (L) is invalid as it reverses direction and collides with the body at (1,6).\n- **Food Life Span Management**: \n  - (3,5) has life span 3 at turn 14 and must be eaten by turn 16 to avoid expiration. The plan eats it on turn 15.\n  - (5,5) has life span 6 at turn 14 and is eaten on turn 17, well before expiration.\n  - (4,5) has life span 9 at turn 14 and is eaten on turn 16, with ample time remaining.\n- **Collision Avoidance**: \n  - The snake avoids walls (borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal obstacle at (5,6)).\n  - No tail reward danger exists, as the tail is never adjacent to the head when eating food.\n- **Movement Constraints**: Instant reverse is prevented (e.g., after moving down on turn 14, the head direction becomes D, so moving up on turn 15 is invalid).\n- **5+ Turns Planning**: The sequence covers turns 14–18 (5 turns) to eat all food and initiate a survival path. After turn 18, the snake can continue moving safely in open areas (e.g., downward or right from (5,4)) as no food remains.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 14 (t1=14)**: Move down (D) to (2,5).  \n  - Rationale: Positions the snake at (2,5), one cell away from (3,5), on the food row. Avoids walls and body.\n- **Turn 15**: Move right (R) to (3,5) to eat the food.  \n  - Rationale: Eats (3,5) with life span 2 (after decrease from turn 14). Snake grows to length 7. Head direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 16**: Move right (R) to (4,5) to eat the food.  \n  - Rationale: Eats (4,5) with life span 7 (after decreases). Snake grows to length 8. Head direction remains R.\n- **Turn 17**: Move right (R) to (5,5) to eat the food.  \n  - Rationale: Eats (5,5) with life span 3 (after decreases). Snake grows to length 9. Head direction remains R.\n- **Turn 18**: Move down (D) to (5,4).  \n  - Rationale: After eating all food, move down to avoid the obstacle at (5,6) and the right wall, entering open space for survival. Head direction becomes D.\n\nThis sequence scores +3 by eating all food, with no risk of collision or starvation. Beyond turn 18, the snake should continue moving to safe cells (e.g., down or left) to maximize survival.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 14: D (down)\nTurn 15: R (right)\nTurn 16: R (right)\nTurn 17: R (right)\nTurn 18: D (down)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. The current turn is 15. The grid has walls: border cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7, and there's an internal obstacle at (5,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but with walls on the borders and one obstacle inside.\n\nSnake positions: head at (2,5), then body segments at (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), and tail at (1,3). So the snake is 6 segments long. Head direction is down, which is D, meaning moving towards decreasing y? Let's clarify coordinates. Typically in grids, (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? The movement: U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), L is (x-1,y), R is (x+1,y). Since D is (x,y-1), that means y decreases as we go down, so (0,0) is probably bottom-left, with y increasing up. But in the snake positions, head at (2,5), and direction D, which should be towards (2,4) if it moves down.\n\nCurrent head position is (2,5), direction D. From the positions, previous head was at (2,6) since body segments show (2,6) next to head. Let's list the positions: index 0: (2,5) head, 1: (2,6), 2: (1,6), 3: (1,5), 4: (1,4), 5: (1,3) tail.\n\nSince head is at (2,5) and body at (2,6), which is above it (since y=6 > y=5, so y increases up), so moving down to (2,5) from (2,6) makes sense with direction D.\n\nNow, food positions:\n\n- (3,5) with life span 2, value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (5,5) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (4,5) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food has value 1, so all positive. No negative food here.\n\nLife span: each food disappears after that many turns, including current turn. So for (3,5), life span 2, meaning it will disappear after 2 more turns? Life span decreases every turn, including current turn.\n\nThe input says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn 15, life span is given, so after this turn, it decreases to life_span - 1, and so on, until it reaches 0 and disappears.\n\nFor (3,5): life span 2 at turn 15. So on turn 15, if not eaten, life span becomes 1. On turn 16, if not eaten, life span becomes 0 and it disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 15 or 16.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5): life span 5, so it will last until turn 19 (since 15 to 19 is 5 turns? Let's calculate: at turn 15, life span 5; after turn 15, life span 4; turn 16, life span 3; turn 17, life span 2; turn 18, life span 1; turn 19, life span 0, disappears. So available from turn 15 to 19.\n\nLife span N means it can be eaten for N turns, from turn t to t+N-1, disappearing at turn t+N.\n\nAt turn t, life span L, it can be eaten on turns t, t+1, ..., t+L-1. On turn t+L, it disappears.\n\nFor (3,5): L=2 at t=15, so can be eaten on turn 15 or 16, disappears on turn 17.\n\nTurn 15: L=2, eaten or not, after turn L=1\n\nTurn 16: L=1, eaten or not, after turn L=0, disappears\n\nSimilarly, (5,5): L=5 at t=15, can be eaten turns 15 to 19, disappears turn 20.\n\n(4,5): L=8, can be eaten turns 15 to 22, disappears turn 23.\n\nNow, snake head at (2,5), direction D (down). Current possible moves: since direction is D, I can move L (left), R (right), or D (down), but not U (up) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. Rule: \"No instant reverse\": cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nCurrent direction is D (down), so opposite is U (up). So I cannot move U. Possible moves: D, L, or R.\n\nNow, let's see the grid to avoid walls and body.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nSnake body: positions (2,5) head, (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3). So the cells occupied by snake are these six.\n\nNow, head at (2,5). Possible moves:\n\n- D (down): to (2,4). Is this safe? (2,4) is not a wall; y=4 > 0, since y=0 is wall. Walls y=0, so y=4 is fine. x=2 between 1 and 6? x=0 and x=7 walls, so x from 1 to 6? Grid size: x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so valid x: 1 to 6. Similarly y: 1 to 6? y=0 and y=7 walls, so y from 1 to 6? Let's confirm.\n\nWalls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? y=0 and y=7 walls, so y from 1 to 6? But in positions, snake has y=3,4,5,6, which are within 1 to 6? y=1 to 6 inclusive.\n\ny=0 wall, y=1 is bottom? Since D is (x,y-1), decreasing y, so y=1 is the lowest row, y=6 highest? Positions: head (2,5), body (2,6) which is y=6, and (1,6) y=6, (1,5) y=5, (1,4) y=4, (1,3) y=3. So y from 3 to 6, all within 1 to 6. y=1 and y=6 are valid, not walls. Walls are y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to 6 are free, similarly x=1 to 6.\n\nInternal obstacle: (5,6) is a wall.\n\nSo for head at (2,5), possible moves:\n\n- D: to (2,4) - check if wall or body. (2,4): not wall, not in snake body? Snake body: (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3). So (2,4) not in this list, so free. But when snake moves, the tail moves, so (1,3) will be vacated, but at the moment, before move, (2,4) is empty? Let's see the grid.\n\nCurrent occupied cells: walls and snake.\n\nFree cells: all except walls and snake positions.\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (5,6).\n\nSnake: (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)\n\nSo (2,4) is not a wall and not occupied by snake, so it should be free.\n\nSimilarly, L: left to (1,5). (1,5) is currently occupied by the snake body, segment at index 3: (1,5). But when we move, the head moves to a new position, and the tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail is vacated, but the body segments move.\n\nImportant: when the snake moves, the head goes to a new cell, and the tail is removed, so the cell that was tail becomes free, but other body segments shift.\n\nSpecifically, if head moves to a new cell, that cell becomes the new head, and the tail cell is removed, so it's free now.\n\nBut during the move, if the head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by the body, except the tail, it collides.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, for a move to be valid:\n\n- If moving to a cell that is not occupied or occupied by food, but food is separate; the cell might have food, but we can move there to eat it.\n\nBut collision: if the cell is occupied by a body segment other than the tail, it's collision.\n\nIf occupied by the tail, it's ok, because tail moves away.\n\nAlso, walls.\n\nSo back to possible moves from (2,5):\n\n- D: to (2,4). Current occupants: is (2,4) occupied? Snake positions: (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3). So (2,4) not in list, so not occupied. Walls: not wall. So (2,4) is free, no food? Food is at (3,5), (5,5), (4,5), not (2,4). So moving to (2,4) is safe, no food, just empty cell.\n\n- L: left to (1,5). (1,5) is currently occupied by snake body, segment index 3. Is it the tail? Tail is (1,3), so (1,5) is not tail, it's a body segment. So moving to (1,5) would cause collision with body.\n\n- R: right to (3,5). (3,5) has food? Yes, food at (3,5) with value 1. So moving to (3,5) would eat the food.\n\nNow, is (3,5) safe to move? Currently, is it occupied? Snake positions don't include (3,5), only (2,5), etc. Walls not, so it's free but has food. Moving there: since it has food, we eat it, snake grows, so after eating, the tail doesn't move, so the new segment is added.\n\nRule: when eating positive food, length +1, so tail stays, head moves to food, new head, and the body extends.\n\nSpecifically: if head moves to a cell with food, it eats it, the snake grows by one segment, so the tail remains, and the new head is at the food cell.\n\nIf no food, head moves to new cell, tail is removed.\n\nFor (3,5): moving there eats the food, so snake grows to 7 segments.\n\nNow, collision: (3,5) is not currently occupied by snake, so no collision.\n\nBut we need to check if after move, it's safe, but the move is to the cell, and since not body or wall, it should be fine.\n\nBut there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because head and newly grown tail collide.\n\nIn this case, for move to (3,5), we're not eating food from tail cell; the food is at (3,5), which is not the tail.\n\nTail is at (1,3), far away.\n\nSo moving R to (3,5) should be fine.\n\nAnother move: I can only move D, L, R, but L to (1,5) is occupied by body, not tail, so invalid, collision.\n\nSo possible actions: D to (2,4) or R to (3,5).\n\nU is not possible because reverse.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score, prioritize survival.\n\nCurrent turn 15.\n\nIf I move R to (3,5), I eat the food there, value +1, snake grows to 7 segments. Food at (3,5) has life span 2, so it disappears after turn 16 if not eaten, but I eat it now.\n\nThen, after eating, snake positions: head was at (2,5), moves to (3,5), so new head at (3,5). Then the body: the segment that was at (2,5) becomes part of body, and since we ate food, the tail doesn't move, so positions: new head (3,5), then previous positions: (2,5) now body, then (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) still tail? When we eat, we add a new segment at the head, so the tail remains.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat, head moves to food, new segment added, so the body extends, tail stays.\n\nSo positions: before move: [ (2,5)H, (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)T ]\n\nAfter move R to (3,5) and eat: head to (3,5), then the previous head (2,5) becomes body, so new positions: [ (3,5)H, (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)T ] tail still at (1,3), length 7.\n\nDirection: since we moved R, new head direction is R.\n\nIf I move D to (2,4), no food, so head moves to (2,4), tail moves away from (1,3), so new positions: head (2,4), then body: (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) new tail? Previous tail (1,3) is removed, so positions: [ (2,4)H, (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)T ] length still 6.\n\nDirection D.\n\nNow, I need to plan multiple turns.\n\nFirst, let's list all food:\n\n- Food A: (3,5) life span 2 (turns 15,16)\n\n- Food B: (5,5) life span 5 (turns 15-19)\n\n- Food C: (4,5) life span 8 (turns 15-22)\n\nAll at y=5, x=3,4,5.\n\nSnake head at (2,5), so (3,5) is adjacent right.\n\nIf I don't eat (3,5) now, it might disappear soon, but I can eat it next turn if I move to (2,4) or something.\n\nBut I should think long term.\n\nAlso, there's a wall at (5,6), which might be relevant.\n\nCurrent snake body is on the left, from x=1 to 2, y=3 to 6.\n\nGrid is 6x6 playable area? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, but (5,6) is wall, so not all cells free.\n\nFree cells: except walls and snake.\n\nBut snake will move.\n\nNow, to maximize score, I need to eat as much food as possible, but avoid risks.\n\nSince all food is positive, I should try to eat them when possible, but not if it leads to dead end.\n\nFirst, option: move R to (3,5) and eat food now.\n\nThen head at (3,5), direction R.\n\nNext turn, possible moves: from (3,5), direction R, so I can move R, U, D, but not L (reverse).\n\nCurrent direction after move is R.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- R to (4,5): has food C? (4,5) has food with life span 8, so yes, I can eat it.\n\n(4,5) is food position.\n\n- U to (3,6): y=6, is it wall? y=7 wall, y=6 is not wall, but internal obstacle? Walls: border y=7 wall, y=6 not border, but internal obstacle at (5,6), not (3,6). So (3,6) should be free, but is it occupied?\n\nCurrent after eating (3,5), snake positions: [ (3,5)H, (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) ] at turn 15 after move.\n\nBut for turn 16, if I move from there.\n\nSimilarly, D to (3,4).\n\nNow, (3,6): is it occupied? In current positions, (2,6) and (1,6) are at y=6, but (3,6) not listed, so probably free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) not occupied.\n\nBut let's think step by step.\n\nIf I eat (3,5) at turn 15, head to (3,5), direction R.\n\nTurn 16: from (3,5), I can:\n\n- Move R to (4,5): which has food, so eat it, grow to 8 segments. Then head at (4,5), direction R.\n\n- Or move U to (3,6)\n\n- Or move D to (3,4)\n\nBut moving R to (4,5) seems good, eat another food.\n\nThen after that, head at (4,5), direction R.\n\nTurn 17: from (4,5), possible moves: R to (5,5), which has food B, eat it; or U to (4,6); or D to (4,4); or L to (3,5), but direction R, so L is reverse? Current direction R, opposite is L, so cannot move L.\n\nSo can move R, U, D.\n\nIf I move R to (5,5), eat food, grow to 9 segments.\n\nThen head at (5,5), direction R.\n\nNow, turn 18: from (5,5), possible moves: R to (6,5); U to (5,6); D to (5,4); but U to (5,6): (5,6) is internal obstacle, wall, so cannot move there. D to (5,4); R to (6,5).\n\nx=6, y=5: x=6 is not wall? Walls: x=7 wall, x=6 is not border wall, and no internal obstacle mentioned except (5,6), so (6,5) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) free.\n\nBut (5,6) wall.\n\nSo from (5,5), can move R to (6,5), U not possible (wall), D to (5,4), or L to (4,5) but reverse not allowed, direction R, so cannot move L.\n\nSo only R or D.\n\nIf move R to (6,5), no food, so just move.\n\nThen head to (6,5), direction R.\n\nNow, snake positions: after eating at (5,5), head at (5,5), body includes (4,5), (3,5), etc.\n\nAt turn 18, if move to (6,5), no food, so tail moves, positions shift.\n\nBut (6,5) is at x=6, y=5.\n\nThen from there, possible moves: direction R, so can move R? R to (7,5), but x=7 is wall, cannot. U to (6,6); D to (6,4); or L to (5,5), but reverse not allowed.\n\nU to (6,6): y=6, x=6, not wall? Walls: x=7 and y=7 walls, x=6,y=6 should be free, but internal obstacle only at (5,6), so (6,6) free.\n\nSimilarly, D to (6,4) free.\n\nBut cannot move R, wall.\n\nSo from (6,5), I can move U to (6,6) or D to (6,4) or L but cannot.\n\nNow, moving U to (6,6) or D to (6,4).\n\nThe snake body might be around, need to see future positions.\n\nThis might be getting messy; let's think if I go this path, I eat all three food quickly: at turn 15 eat (3,5), turn 16 eat (4,5), turn 17 eat (5,5), so by turn 17, I have eaten three food, score +3, snake length 9.\n\nThen at turn 18, I'm at (5,5) or after moving to (6,5).\n\nBut after eating (5,5) at turn 17, head at (5,5), then turn 18 move to (6,5), say.\n\nThen from (6,5), I need to move, say to (6,6) or (6,4).\n\nThe grid has limited space, and snake is long, might trap itself.\n\nFor example, if I go to (6,6), then from there, possible moves.\n\nBut let's see the current state after eating.\n\nAlso, food C at (4,5) is eaten early, life span long, no issue.\n\nBut after eating all, I need to survive.\n\nNow, alternative: if I don't eat (3,5) now, but move D to (2,4).\n\nThen at turn 15, move D to (2,4), no food, so positions: head (2,4), body (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) tail. Direction D.\n\nThen turn 16: from (2,4), direction D, so can move D, L, R. Not U (reverse).\n\n- D to (2,3)\n\n- L to (1,4)\n\n- R to (3,4)\n\nNow, (1,4) is currently the tail? After move, tail is at (1,4)? Positions: after turn 15 move, [ (2,4)H, (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)T ]\n\nSo (1,4) is tail.\n\nIf I move L to (1,4), which is the tail cell. Moving to tail cell is allowed, since tail moves away. But is there food? (1,4) has no food, so moving there: head to (1,4), which was tail, so no collision, and since no food, tail moves, but tail was at (1,4), now head moves there, and the segment that was before tail becomes new tail.\n\nSpecifically: head moves to (1,4), which was occupied by tail, so no issue. Then the new positions: head (1,4), then previous head (2,4) becomes body, so [ (1,4)H, (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) ] and tail is now (1,5)? Let's see: the segment after head is (2,4), which was head, then (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), and (1,5) was body, now tail? Positions: indices: after move, new head at (1,4), then the body segments are the previous positions except tail is removed, but since we moved to tail, it's a bit different.\n\nStandard: when head moves to a cell, if it was empty, tail is removed; if it was food, tail not removed; but if it was tail, since tail moves, it's like empty.\n\nRule: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo when moving to tail cell, it's safe, and since no food, the snake doesn't grow, tail is removed as usual, so the new tail is the segment that was second last.\n\nIn this case, before move: positions [ (2,4)H, (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)T ]\n\nMove L to (1,4): head moves to (1,4), which was tail. Then the new head is (1,4), and the body: the segment at (2,4) becomes the first body segment, then (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), and the tail (1,4) is gone, so (1,5) is now the tail? The positions shift: the tail is removed, so new positions: [ (1,4)H, (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)T ] yes, tail at (1,5).\n\nSimilarly, if moving to empty cell.\n\nBack to turn 16 options from (2,4):\n\n- D to (2,3): empty? (2,3) not occupied, not wall, no food, so safe move.\n\n- L to (1,4): as above, safe, since tail.\n\n- R to (3,4): empty, no food.\n\nNow, also, food at (3,5) is still there, life span 2 at turn 15, so at turn 16, if not eaten, life span 1, so can be eaten turn 16.\n\nIf I move R to (3,4) at turn 16, I'm at (3,4), then I can go up to (3,5) to eat food, etc.\n\nBut let's compare the two main choices at turn 15.\n\nFirst choice: move R to (3,5) at turn 15, eat food, grow to 7, head at (3,5), dir R.\n\nThen turn 16, I can move R to (4,5) to eat another food, etc., as before.\n\nBut after eating (5,5) at turn 17, I'm at (5,5) with dir R, and the only safe moves are to (6,5) or (5,4), since U to (5,6) wall.\n\n(5,4) is down.\n\nIf I move to (6,5) at turn 18, then from (6,5), dir R, but I can't move R, so must move U to (6,6) or D to (6,4).\n\nSay move U to (6,6) at turn 18.\n\nThen head at (6,6), dir U.\n\nThen turn 19, from (6,6), dir U, can move U to (6,7), but y=7 wall, cannot; or L to (5,6), but (5,6) wall, cannot; or R to (7,6), x=7 wall, cannot; or D to (6,5), but reverse not allowed, since dir U, D is opposite.\n\nCurrent dir U, opposite D, so cannot move D.\n\nPossible moves: U, L, R, but all lead to walls: U (6,7) wall, L (5,6) wall, R (7,6) wall. So no possible move, death!\n\nOh, problem. If I go to (6,6) at turn 18, I'm trapped, no escape, since all adjacent cells are walls or invalid.\n\n(6,6) adjacent: U (6,7) y=7 wall, D (6,5) but if I just came from (6,5), and dir U, so moving D is reverse, not allowed. L (5,6) wall, R (7,6) x=7 wall. So indeed, no valid move, collision or stuck, die.\n\nIf from (6,5) I move D to (6,4) instead.\n\nAt turn 18, from (5,5) move R to (6,5), dir R.\n\nThen turn 19, from (6,5), move D to (6,4), dir down.\n\nThen head at (6,4), dir D.\n\nThen turn 20, from (6,4), dir D, can move D to (6,3); L to (5,4); R to (7,4) wall, cannot; U to (6,5), but reverse not allowed.\n\nSo can move D or L.\n\n(6,3) or (5,4).\n\nBut snake body might be around, need to see positions.\n\nAfter turn 17: ate (5,5), head at (5,5), positions: let's trace.\n\nStart turn 15: move R to (3,5), eat, positions: H(3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)T\n\nTurn 16: move R to (4,5), eat food C, grow, positions: H(4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)T? When eat, tail not move, so after eating at (4,5), new head (4,5), then (3,5) body, etc., down to (1,3) tail, length 8.\n\nPositions: [ (4,5)H, (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)T ]\n\nTurn 17: move R to (5,5), eat food B, grow to 9, positions: H(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)T\n\nTail still at (1,3).\n\nTurn 18: from (5,5), cannot move U (wall), cannot move L (reverse), so move R to (6,5) or D to (5,4).\n\nSay move R to (6,5), no food, so tail moves: head to (6,5), then body: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) new tail? Tail removed, so positions: [ (6,5)H, (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)T ] tail at (1,4).\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 19: from (6,5), move D to (6,4), dir down, positions: head to (6,4), no food, tail moves: [ (6,4)H, (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)T ] tail at (1,5).\n\nThen turn 20, from (6,4), dir D, can move D to (6,3), L to (5,4), or U but reverse not allowed.\n\n(6,3) or (5,4).\n\nNow, the snake is stretched, but there is space below and left.\n\nFor example, move to (5,4), then I can go down or left.\n\nBut the food at (4,5) is already eaten, and (3,5) eaten, so no more food on row 5.\n\nBut there might be other areas, but currently no other food, so I need to survive, but no score gain.\n\nBack to turn 15, if I move to (3,5), I eat one food, but then by turn 17 I eat all three, but then at turn 19 I might be at (6,4), which is ok, but I have eaten all food, and the snake is long, which might make it harder to maneuver without colliding.\n\nIn the path above, when I went to (6,6), I died, but if I go down to (6,4), I can continue.\n\nBut in that case, I have eaten all food by turn 17, so score +3.\n\nNow, second choice at turn 15: move D to (2,4).\n\nThen positions: [ (2,4)H, (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)T ] dir D.\n\nTurn 16: from (2,4), dir D, can move to (2,3), (1,4), or (3,4).\n\nFood at (3,5) is still available, life span now 1 (since at turn 15 not eaten, life span decreased to 1).\n\nAt turn 16, life span of (3,5) is 1, so can be eaten this turn, else disappears.\n\nIf I move R to (3,4) at turn 16, then I'm at (3,4), which is below (3,5).\n\nThen I can move U to (3,5) to eat the food on turn 17.\n\nBut on turn 17, if I move to (3,5), but the food might be gone if not eaten turn 16? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 16, food (3,5) life span 1: if eaten turn 16, ok; if not, after turn 16, it disappears.\n\nSo if at turn 16 I am at (2,4), and I move to (3,4), I don't eat (3,5) yet.\n\nThen at turn 17, if I move U to (3,5), but if food disappeared, no food, or if still there.\n\nAfter turn 16, if not eaten, food (3,5) disappears.\n\nAt turn 16 start, life span of (3,5) is 1, meaning it can be eaten on turn 16. After turn 16, if not eaten, it disappears before turn 17.\n\nSo to eat (3,5), I must be on (3,5) at turn 16.\n\nIf at turn 16 I am at (2,4), and I move to (3,5) directly? From (2,4) to (3,5) is not adjacent; adjacent cells are same x or y difference 1.\n\n(2,4) to (3,5) is diagonal, not allowed; must move to (2,5), (3,4), (2,3), or (1,4), not (3,5) directly.\n\nSo to reach (3,5) from (2,4), I need two moves: e.g., move to (3,4) then U to (3,5), but that would be turn 17, by which time food is gone.\n\nSpecifically: turn 16, move from (2,4) to say (3,4), then at end of turn 16, food (3,5) not eaten, so it disappears.\n\nThen turn 17, I can move to (3,5), but no food there, just empty cell.\n\nSo I missed the food at (3,5) if I don't eat it at turn 16 directly.\n\nFrom (2,4), I cannot move directly to (3,5); only to adjacent: (2,3), (1,4), (3,4), (2,5) but (2,5) is occupied by body? After turn 15 move, positions [ (2,4)H, (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)T ]\n\nSo (2,5) is body segment, not tail, so moving to (2,5) would collide, invalid.\n\nSimilarly, (1,4) is tail, so I can move to (1,4), safe.\n\n(3,4) empty.\n\n(2,3) empty.\n\nSo from (2,4) turn 16, I can move to (3,4), but not to (3,5).\n\nThen after moving to (3,4), food at (3,5) is not eaten, so it disappears.\n\nThen turn 17, from (3,4), I can move to (3,5), but no food, or to other places.\n\nBut I missed the food.\n\nIf at turn 16 I move to (1,4), which is tail, then head at (1,4), and I can then move to (1,5) or something, but (1,5) is body? Positions after move: [ (1,4)H, (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)T ] so (1,5) is tail now? Tail at (1,5), so moving to (1,5) is possible, but no food.\n\nNot helpful for (3,5).\n\nSo if I move D at turn 15, I cannot eat (3,5) at all, since I can't reach it in time; only at turn 16 I could eat it if I were adjacent, but from (2,4), (3,5) is not adjacent, so I miss it.\n\nTherefore, to eat (3,5), I must eat it at turn 15 or 16, but at turn 15 I can eat it by moving R, or if I don't, at turn 16 only if I am at (3,5) or adjacent and move to it.\n\nAt turn 15, head at (2,5), adjacent to (3,5), so I can eat it turn 15.\n\nAt turn 16, if head is at a cell adjacent to (3,5), like (3,4), (3,6), (2,5), or (4,5).\n\nBut at turn 16, if I moved D to (2,4) at turn 15, then at turn 16 head at (2,4), which is not adjacent to (3,5); (2,4) adjacent to (2,5), (1,4), (3,4), (2,3), none is (3,5).\n\n(2,5) is occupied by body, so I cannot move there to be adjacent; from (2,4), I can only move to the cells above, not directly to (3,5).\n\nSo indeed, if I move D at turn 15, I cannot eat (3,5) at all; it will disappear uneaten.\n\nTherefore, to get that food, I must move R at turn 15.\n\nMoreover, the other foods have longer life, so I can eat them later.\n\nBut in the first path, when I ate all quickly, I might get stuck at the corner.\n\nBut I could avoid going to (6,6).\n\nFor example, after eating (5,5) at turn 17, instead of moving R to (6,5), I could move D to (5,4) at turn 18.\n\nThen from (5,4), I can go down or left, etc.\n\nLet's see.\n\nTurn 17: after eating (5,5), head at (5,5), dir R.\n\nTurn 18: move D to (5,4), dir down, no food? (5,4) no food, so tail moves: positions: [ (5,4)H, (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)T ] tail at (1,4).\n\nThen turn 19, from (5,4), dir D, can move D to (5,3), L to (4,4), R to (6,4), or U but reverse not allowed.\n\n(5,3), (4,4), (6,4) all possible.\n\nThen I can explore the bottom area.\n\nAnd there might be space, no immediate danger.\n\nSimilarly, I can eat the food at (4,5) if not eaten, but it was eaten earlier.\n\nIn this case, all food eaten by turn 17.\n\nBut at turn 15, if I move R, I eat (3,5), then I can choose not to eat (4,5) immediately, but since it's there, why not.\n\nBut I need to think about survival.\n\nAnother thing: the snake body is on the left, so if I go right, I have more space.\n\nBut in the corner, it might be tight.\n\nPerhaps I should not eat all food in a row; maybe eat one and then go down to have more room.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nThe playable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, but (5,6) wall, so cells like (5,6) blocked.\n\nAvailable cells: 6x6=36 cells minus walls: borders are walls, but borders are x=0,7 y=0,7, so inner 6x6 is x=1-6 y=1-6, 36 cells.\n\nMinus internal wall (5,6), so 35 cells.\n\nSnake length 6, so 29 free cells.\n\nAfter eating three food, length 9, so more crowded.\n\nBut at turn 15, with head at (2,5), moving R to (3,5) seems good to get the food before it expires.\n\nThen at turn 16, from (3,5), instead of moving R to (4,5), I could move D to (3,4) or U to (3,6).\n\nFor example, move D to (3,4) at turn 16.\n\nThen from (3,4), I can later go to eat (4,5) or (5,5), but (4,5) and (5,5) have longer life, so I can delay.\n\nBut (3,5) is eaten, so no issue.\n\nTurn 15: move R to (3,5), eat, positions: H(3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)T dir R\n\nTurn 16: move D to (3,4), no food, so tail moves: head to (3,4), then body (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)T new tail? Tail removed, so [ (3,4)H, (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)T ] tail at (1,4), length 7 still? After eating at turn 15, length 7, then turn 16 no eat, so length 7, tail moves to (1,4), yes.\n\nDirection down.\n\nNow, food at (4,5) and (5,5) still there.\n\nFrom (3,4), dir D, turn 17: can move D to (3,3), L to (2,4), R to (4,4), U to (3,5) but reverse not allowed, dir D, so U is opposite, cannot.\n\nSo can move D, L, R.\n\n(3,3), (2,4), (4,4)\n\n(3,5) is body, so cannot move there anyway.\n\nNow, (4,5) is above, I can go to (4,4) then U to (4,5) to eat.\n\nSimilarly for (5,5).\n\nBut life span: (4,5) life span 8 at turn 15, so at turn 17, life span 6? At turn 15, L=8, after turn 15, L=7; turn 16, L=6; turn 17, L=5, etc. Plenty of time.\n\nSimilarly (5,5) L=5 at t15, t16 L=4, t17 L=3, etc.\n\nSo I can eat later.\n\nFor example, at turn 17, move R to (4,4) from (3,4).\n\nThen at (4,4), dir R.\n\nThen turn 18, move U to (4,5) to eat food, etc.\n\nBut let's not plan all; I need to output actions for a few turns.\n\nThe answer should be for turns 15,16,17,... but not specified how many, but since it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide actions for 5 turns or so.\n\nBut the output format is for the current turn and future, but it says \"action on turn t1, t1+1, ...\" so I need to specify for turn 15,16,17,etc.\n\nBut I don't know how many, but perhaps for 5 turns: turn 15 to 19 or 20.\n\nBut let's decide the first move.\n\nGiven the risk of getting stuck in the corner, it might be better to not go all the way right immediately.\n\nBut I can go down after eating one food.\n\nAnother point: the food at (4,5) and (5,5) are on the way, but (5,6) is wall, so near (5,5), I have to be careful.\n\nPerhaps I should move to (2,4) at turn 15 to avoid the risk, but then I miss the (3,5) food, which is only available for two turns.\n\nSince all food is +1, missing one is -1 potential score.\n\nBut survival first.\n\nBut in this case, by moving D, I survive, but miss the food, and the other foods I can eat later.\n\nFor example, from (2,4), turn 15 move D to (2,4), positions as before.\n\nTurn 16, from (2,4), I can move to (3,4), for example.\n\nThen at (3,4), turn 17, I can move to (4,4) or (3,5), but (3,5) food might be gone.\n\n(3,5) gone after turn 16.\n\nSo at turn 17, from (3,4), I can move to (4,4), then to (4,5) to eat food C at turn 18 or something.\n\nLet's not detail.\n\nBut I can still eat (4,5) and (5,5) later.\n\nFor example, from (3,4), move R to (4,4) at turn 17, then turn 18 move U to (4,5) to eat, etc.\n\nSimilar to before.\n\nBut snake is shorter initially, so more room.\n\nBut since I missed one food, score less.\n\nBut safer? Not necessarily.\n\nThe dangerous part is when I go to the right edge.\n\nBut if I eat the foods but don't go to (6,5), I can go down from (5,5).\n\nFor instance, at turn 17, from (5,5) move D to (5,4), then I can explore bottom.\n\nNo problem.\n\nSo the key is to not go to the top-right corner.\n\nTherefore, at turn 15, moving R to (3,5) to eat the expiring food is better, and then I can choose to go down to avoid the corner.\n\nSo I think moving R at turn 15 is the way to go.\n\nThen for turn 16, from (3,5), I can move D to (3,4) to go down, instead of right.\n\nThen I have more space.\n\nSimilarly, I can eat the other food later when convenient.\n\nBut the food at (4,5) is close, I can eat it soon.\n\nBut let's plan the actions.\n\nSince the instruction is to think 5+ turns ahead, I should outline a plan.\n\nCurrent turn 15: move R to (3,5), eat food.\n\nThen turn 16: from (3,5), dir R, I can move D to (3,4) to head down.\n\nThen turn 17: from (3,4), dir D, move to say (3,3) or (4,4), etc.\n\nTo eat (4,5), I can go to (4,4) then up.\n\nBut let's specify.\n\nAlso, for the output, I need to list actions.\n\nPerhaps for turns 15 to 20.\n\nBut I don't need to specify all, but the answer format is to list actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe user said \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the answer should include actions for the current turn and future turns as per format.\n\n\"Answer Format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nAnd \"think 5+ turns ahead\" means I need to plan for at least 5 future turns in my reasoning, but the output can be for as many as I want, I think.\n\nTo be safe, provide for 5 turns: turn 15 to 19.\n\nFirst, at turn 15, move R.\n\nThen turn 16, move D to (3,4) to avoid going right immediately.\n\nThen from (3,4), turn 17, move R to (4,4) to approach (4,5).\n\nThen turn 18, move U to (4,5) to eat food.\n\nThen turn 19, from (4,5), dir U, can move U to (4,6), or L to (3,5), or R to (5,5), etc.\n\n(4,6) is free? Not wall, no body yet.\n\nThen I can go to (5,5) later.\n\nBut let's see if it works.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: but not applicable here.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 15: R\n\nTurn 16: D (down from (3,5) to (3,4))\n\nThen turn 17: from (3,4), dir D, move R to (4,4)? Directions: from (3,4), after moving D to (3,4), direction is D, so moving R to (4,4) is right, not reverse, so ok.\n\nThen at (4,4), dir R (since moved right).\n\nThen turn 18: move U to (4,5) to eat food.\n\n(4,5) has food, so eat, grow.\n\nThen head at (4,5), dir U.\n\nThen turn 19: from (4,5), dir U, can move U to (4,6), or L to (3,5), or R to (5,5), or D but reverse not allowed.\n\n(3,5) might be occupied, but let's see positions.\n\nAfter turn 18: ate (4,5), so positions include (4,5) head, (4,4) body, etc.\n\nBut (3,5) might be part of body.\n\nTo avoid collision, but (3,5) could be body if not moved away.\n\nBut when we move, it should be fine.\n\nSince we are at (4,5), and (5,5) has food, I can move R to (5,5) to eat it.\n\nTurn 19: move R to (5,5), eat, grow.\n\nThen head at (5,5), dir R.\n\nThen turn 20, from (5,5), move D to (5,4) to avoid the wall.\n\n Etc.\n\nBut for the output, I can provide up to turn 19.\n\nNow, to confirm the first action.\n\nSince moving D at turn 15 makes me miss the (3,5) food, and moving R allows me to eat it and potentially others, with care to not get stuck, I think R is better.\n\nAnd for survival, by going down early, I have space.\n\nSo I'll go with move R at turn 15.\n\nThen for the actions:\n\nTurn 15: R\n\nThen for turn 16, from (3,5), I move D to (3,4)\n\nTurn 17: from (3,4), move R to (4,4)  // to approach (4,5)\n\nTurn 18: from (4,4), move U to (4,5)  // eat food C\n\nTurn 19: from (4,5), move R to (5,5)  // eat food B\n\nThen I can stop, or add more.\n\nBut at turn 19, after moving to (5,5), I need to move away.\n\nBut for the answer, provide these.\n\nSince thinking ahead, but output for current and next few.\n\nPerhaps 5 actions: turn 15 to 19.\n\nNow, in the move at turn 18 to (4,5), eating food, but (4,5) might be under body? No, in this path, at that point, the body might not be there.\n\nLet's simulate positions briefly.\n\nTurn 15 start: snake: H(2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)T\n\nAfter move R to (3,5): eat, so new positions: H(3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)T  // length 7\n\nTurn 16: move D to (3,4): no food, so move: head to (3,4), tail moves: so positions: H(3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)T  // (1,3) removed, tail at (1,4)\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 17: move R to (4,4): no food, move: head to (4,4), tail moves: positions: H(4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)T  // tail at (1,5)\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 18: move U to (4,5): (4,5) has food, so eat: head to (4,5), no tail move, grow: positions: H(4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)T  // (1,5) still tail? New segment, so tail at (1,5), length 8.\n\nDirection U.\n\nTurn 19: move R to (5,5): (5,5) has food, eat: head to (5,5), grow: positions: H(5,5), (4,5), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)T  // length 9\n\nDirection R.\n\nThen from here, I can move D to (5,4) or something, but not in the output.\n\nAll moves safe, and I ate three food by turn 19.\n\nAt turn 15 I ate one, turn 18 one, turn 19 one.\n\n(3,5) at turn 15, (4,5) at turn 18, (5,5) at turn 19.\n\nAnd I avoided the corner issue.\n\nSo this seems good.\n\nIf I had gone right all the way, I might have problem, but here I went down first.\n\nSo for the answer, I can provide actions for turn 15 to 19.\n\nBut the user might expect actions starting from current turn.\n\nAlso, in the output, it should be in the box.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 15: R\n\nTurn 16: D\n\nTurn 17: R\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: R\n\nIn terms of direction.\n\nNow, to write in the format.\n</think>\n### Reasoning for 5+ Turns Ahead\n\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I evaluated the current state and planned actions for at least 5 turns (turns 15 to 19). Key considerations:\n- **Food Priorities**: \n  - Food at (3,5) has a short life span (2 at turn 15), so it must be eaten by turn 16 or it disappears. Missing it loses a +1 score opportunity.\n  - Foods at (5,5) and (4,5) have longer life spans (5 and 8, respectively), so they can be eaten later without immediate risk.\n- **Snake Position and Direction**: \n  - Head at (2,5) with direction D (down). Possible moves at turn 15: R (right to (3,5)) or D (down to (2,4)). L (left) is invalid due to body collision at (1,5), and U (up) is invalid due to instant reverse.\n  - Moving R to (3,5) eats the expiring food and grows the snake, but requires careful pathing to avoid the risky top-right corner near (6,6) and the wall at (5,6). Moving D avoids immediate risk but misses the (3,5) food, reducing potential score.\n- **Risk Assessment**:\n  - Eating (3,5) at turn 15 is optimal to secure the score. However, moving directly right toward (4,5) and (5,5) could trap the snake in the top-right corner (e.g., at (6,6) with no escape). To mitigate this, I plan to divert downward early (turn 16) to create maneuvering space.\n  - After eating (3,5), moving D to (3,4) at turn 16 avoids the crowded top row and positions the snake to approach remaining food safely.\n  - Foods at (4,5) and (5,5) are eaten in later turns (18 and 19) after careful approach, ensuring no collision risks.\n- **Survival Focus**: \n  - The snake length increases from 6 to 9 by turn 19, but by moving downward and using the bottom half of the grid, the snake has ample space to avoid self-collision or walls. No dead ends are created in this plan.\n- **Turn-by-Turn Simulation**:\n  - **Turn 15**: Move R to (3,5) to eat food (+1 score, length 7). Head now at (3,5), direction R.\n  - **Turn 16**: Move D to (3,4) to avoid top-right risk and create space. No food eaten, tail moves, length 7. Head at (3,4), direction D.\n  - **Turn 17**: Move R to (4,4) to approach (4,5). No food eaten, tail moves, length 7. Head at (4,4), direction R.\n  - **Turn 18**: Move U to (4,5) to eat food (+1 score, length 8). Head at (4,5), direction U.\n  - **Turn 19**: Move R to (5,5) to eat food (+1 score, length 9). Head at (5,5), direction R. From here, future moves (e.g., D to (5,4)) can avoid walls and continue safely.\n\nThis plan scores +3 by turn 19 and ensures survival by avoiding high-risk areas. Alternative paths (e.g., not eating (3,5) or moving directly right) risk missing points or causing traps.\n\n### Actions for Turns 15 to 19\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 15: R (right)  \nTurn 16: D (down)  \nTurn 17: R (right)  \nTurn 18: U (up)  \nTurn 19: R (right)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 16, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), with (0,0) probably being the bottom-left or top-left? I should define the coordinate system. Typically, in such grids, (0,0) might be bottom-left or top-left. But since movement is given as U for (x,y+1), that suggests increasing y is up, so (0,0) is likely bottom-left, and (0,7) is top-left? Let's see:\n\n- U: (x, y+1) — so y increases upward.\n\n- D: (x, y-1) — y decreases downward.\n\n- L: (x-1, y)\n\n- R: (x+1, y)\n\nAlso, walls: x=0 and x=7 are vertical walls, y=0 and y=7 are horizontal walls. So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6)? Let's confirm:\n\nBorder cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. Therefore, valid cells are x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? No, x=0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x from 1 to 6 inclusive? Similarly for y.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, so x coordinates from 1 to 6 are free, but y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6. But let's list the coordinates.\n\nFor example, (0,0) is a corner wall, (0,1) is wall, up to (0,7), similarly (7,0) to (7,7), and for y=0, (1,0) to (6,0), y=7, (1,7) to (6,7). So the inner grid where the snake can move is from (1,1) to (6,6), I think. x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, that's 6x6 grid? Let's see: min x=1, max x=6; min y=1, max y=6. So positions like (1,1), (1,2), ..., (6,6) are playable.\n\nBut there's an internal obstacle at (5,6). So (5,6) is blocked.\n\nNow, snake positions: head at (3,5), then body: (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3). So the snake is 7 segments long.\n\nHead direction is R, which is right, so moving east.\n\nFood:\n\n- (5,5) with life span 4, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (4,5) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (5,1) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food here.\n\nLife span: for (5,5), life span 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns, including current turn? The problem says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 16, life span 4 means it will disappear after turn 19? Let's clarify.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo, at turn t, if life_span is L, it will disappear after t + L - 1? Or at the end of turn t + L?\n\nFor example, at turn t, life_span L, after turn t, it decreases to L-1 for turn t+1. When life_span reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nThe countdown decreases every turn, including current. So at the start of turn t, if food has life_span L, after this turn, if not eaten, life_span becomes L-1 at the start of next turn. When life_span is 1, after the turn it is eaten or disappears.\n\nBut for eating, the head moves onto the food cell during the turn.\n\nSo for (5,5), life_span 4 at turn 16. After turn 16, if not eaten, life_span becomes 3 at turn 17. After turn 17, 2 at turn 18. After turn 18, 1 at turn 19. After turn 19, it disappears, so it can be eaten up to turn 19.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) life_span 7: from turn 16 to 22, can be eaten until turn 22.\n\n(5,1) life_span 10: turn 16 to 25.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score with long-term survival.\n\nCurrent turn is t1=16, so I need to output actions for turn 16, 17, 18, etc., but since the state might change, I should plan a sequence based on current state, but I have to consider that food might be eaten or disappear, and snake grows.\n\nThe answer format is to output a sequence of actions starting from turn 16.\n\nBut I need to think ahead to make good decisions.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, but walls at borders, so playable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to6, except internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nSo cells: rows y=1 to 6, columns x=1 to 6.\n\n(5,6) is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: head at (3,5), body: (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)\n\nSo let's list all occupied cells:\n\n- (3,5) head\n\n- (2,5)\n\n- (2,6)\n\n- (1,6)\n\n- (1,5)\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (1,3)\n\nAnd tail is (1,3).\n\nNow, head at (3,5), direction R, so moving right.\n\nPossible moves from (3,5): U, D, L, R.\n\nBut cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is R, so opposite is L (left), so cannot move left immediately.\n\nSo possible actions: U, D, R. (since L is opposite and not allowed)\n\nR is right, which is same direction, allowed.\n\nU is up, D is down, both perpendicular, allowed.\n\nL left is opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo for turn 16, I can go U, D, or R.\n\nNow, I need to think about the food.\n\nFood at:\n\n- (5,5) - life 4\n\n- (4,5) - life 7\n\n- (5,1) - life 10\n\nAll at y=5 or y=1.\n\nHead is at (3,5), so same row y=5.\n\n(4,5) is directly to the right, at x=4,y=5.\n\n(5,5) is further right at x=5,y=5.\n\n(5,1) is south at x=5,y=1.\n\nNow, I should consider paths to food while avoiding collisions.\n\nFirst, let's see the immediate area.\n\nFrom (3,5):\n\n- R to (4,5): that's where food is! (4,5) has food with value 1.\n\nIf I move right to (4,5), I eat the food, since head moves onto it.\n\nThen, since it's positive food, snake grows, so length increases by 1. After eating, the tail doesn't move this turn? Standard snake: when you eat, the head moves to food, and a new segment is added, so tail stays, effectively snake grows.\n\nThe rules: \"Length of snake +1\" for positive food.\n\nAnd for movement: each turn, head moves to new cell, if food eaten, new segment added at head, tail doesn't move; else, tail moves forward, so length same.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (4,5), which has food, I eat it, so head moves to (4,5), and a new head is there, but the body: the current head was (3,5), which becomes body, and since I ate, tail doesn't move, so positions become: head (4,5), then body: (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) — so 8 segments, tail still (1,3).\n\nThen, for next turn, I can move from (4,5).\n\nBut (5,5) is also food, nearby.\n\nHowever, there's a danger: tail reward danger.\n\nThe rule: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nIn this case, currently, tail is at (1,3). Head is at (3,5), not adjacent to tail. Adjacent means sharing a side, so (3,5) and (1,3) are not adjacent; distance is |3-1| + |5-3| = 2+2=4, not adjacent.\n\nAfter moving to (4,5), head at (4,5), tail at (1,3), still not adjacent.\n\nSo no immediate danger from that.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nIf I eat (4,5) now, I get +1, and grow.\n\nThen from (4,5), I can go to (5,5) which is also food, or other directions.\n\n(5,5) has life span 4, so it will disappear after turn 19, but I can eat it soon.\n\nAlso, there's (5,1) but far away.\n\nBut let's see the grid occupancy.\n\nAfter eating (4,5), positions: head (4,5), body: (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)\n\nNow, from (4,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nL would be back to (3,5), which is body, so collision if I go left.\n\nU: (4,6)\n\nD: (4,4)\n\nR: (5,5) which has food.\n\nBut (5,6) is wall? Internal obstacle at (5,6), which is a wall, so cannot go there.\n\ny=6, x=5, (5,6) is blocked, so U from (4,5) to (4,6)? (4,6) is free? Let's see what is at (4,6).\n\nCurrent positions: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), and after move, head at (4,5), body includes (3,5), etc., so (4,6) is empty? Let's list occupied after turn 16 if I move to (4,5):\n\nAfter moving to (4,5) and eating, snake: head (4,5), then segments: (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3). So cells occupied: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)\n\nSo (4,6) is free, (4,4) free, (5,5) has food, but not occupied by body.\n\n(5,5) is food location, not body.\n\nNow, walls: (5,6) is obstacle, so cannot go up to (4,6)? U from (4,5) is (4,6), which is within bounds, and not wall? Walls are only borders and internal obstacles.\n\nBorders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, and internal (5,6).\n\nSo (4,6): x=4, y=6, x from 1-6, y from 1-6, y=6 is not wall? y=7 is wall, so y=6 is playable, but (5,6) is specific internal obstacle, so (4,6) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) free, (5,5) free except food.\n\n(5,5) is a cell, has food, so I can move there.\n\nFrom (4,5), if I go R to (5,5), I eat the food there, since it's positive, grow again.\n\nThen head at (5,5), body: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) — 9 segments.\n\nThen from (5,5), possible moves: U to (5,6) — but (5,6) is internal obstacle, wall, so cannot go up.\n\nD to (5,4)\n\nL to (4,5) which is body, collision.\n\nR to (6,5) — x=6, y=5, which is not border? x=6 is within 1-6, y=5, so playable.\n\nx=7 is wall, so x=6 is ok.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) down.\n\nSo from (5,5), can go D or R.\n\nBut if I go to (5,5) on turn 17, that might be possible.\n\nBut let's not get ahead; first, for turn 16.\n\nBack to turn 16.\n\nIf I move R to (4,5), I eat food immediately, get +1, grow.\n\nBut is this the best? I need to think long-term.\n\nThere is also (5,5) close by, with life span 4, so I can eat it later.\n\nBut if I eat both, I get more points.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nAnother option: from (3,5), I could go U or D.\n\nU: to (3,6)\n\nD: to (3,4)\n\nR: to (4,5) with food.\n\nL not allowed.\n\nNow, if I go U to (3,6), what is there? (3,6) is currently free? Current positions: head (3,5), body (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3). So (3,6) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) empty.\n\nBut (3,6) is y=6, near top.\n\nThen from there, I could go to other places.\n\nBut the food at (4,5) and (5,5) are on row y=5, so if I go up, I might miss them or have to come back.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1) is far south.\n\nLife span: (5,5) has only 4 turns left, so if I don't eat it soon, it might disappear.\n\nTurn 16, life 4, so it can be eaten on turn 16,17,18,19.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) has life 7, until turn 22.\n\n(5,1) life 10, until 25.\n\nSo (5,5) is urgent.\n\nTherefore, I should probably eat (5,5) soon.\n\nFrom current position (3,5), to reach (5,5), I can go right to (4,5), then to (5,5).\n\n(4,5) has food, so if I go to (4,5) first, I eat it, then to (5,5).\n\nI could go directly? But (4,5) is in between, so I have to go through (4,5) to get to (5,5) from left.\n\nUnless I go around, but that might be longer and riskier.\n\nFor example, from (3,5), if I go up to (3,6), then right to (4,6), then down to (4,5) or (5,5), but (4,5) is food, and (5,5) is at (5,5).\n\nBut from (4,6), I can go down to (4,5), which has food, or right to (5,6), but (5,6) is wall, so cannot.\n\n(5,6) is obstacle, so from (4,6), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nU to (4,7) but y=7 is wall, so invalid.\n\nD to (4,5)\n\nL to (3,6) which is where I came from, but if I just moved, it might be body.\n\nR to (5,6) but (5,6) is wall, invalid.\n\nSo from (4,6), only possible move is down to (4,5), since U and R are walls or invalid, L is body or not.\n\nIf I go to (3,6) on turn 16, then from (3,6), I can only go down to (3,5) or other.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nFirst, for turn 16, if I don't go to (4,5), but go up or down.\n\nBut (4,5) is food, and it's directly accessible, so why not eat it? I get a point and grow, which is good for score.\n\nBut I need to avoid risks.\n\nWhat are the risks?\n\nAfter eating (4,5), I am at (4,5), and (5,5) is adjacent, so I can eat it next turn if I go right.\n\nBut after that, from (5,5), I can go down to (5,4) or right to (6,5).\n\nIf I go to (6,5), then from there, I can go down or up, etc.\n\nBut let's see the tail and body.\n\nCurrent tail is at (1,3), which is far.\n\nBut as I move, the tail moves, so the path might clear.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (5,1) is far, but I might go there later.\n\nBut for now, eating the two foods on y=5 seems efficient.\n\nBut let's check if there's any danger of collision or dead end.\n\nFirst, the internal obstacle at (5,6) blocks the top-right area.\n\nAlso, the snake body occupies the left part.\n\nAfter eating both (4,5) and (5,5), I am at (5,5) with a longer snake.\n\nThen from (5,5), I can go down to (5,4), since up is blocked.\n\n(5,4) might be free.\n\nThen to (5,3), (5,2), down to (5,1) to eat that food.\n\n(5,1) has food, so I can go south.\n\nBut let's see the grid size: y from 1 to 6, so (5,1) is bottom row.\n\nNow, possible issue: when I move down, the tail might not move fast enough, but since I grow by eating, the tail stays longer.\n\nLet's plan a sequence.\n\nStart from turn 16.\n\nOption: move R to (4,5) on turn 16. Eat food, grow to 8 segments.\n\nPositions: head (4,5), body: (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)\n\nTurn 17: from (4,5), move R to (5,5). Eat food, grow to 9 segments.\n\nHead (5,5), body: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)\n\nNow, at (5,5), possible moves: D to (5,4) or R to (6,5). Cannot go U (wall) or L (body).\n\nNow, both D and R are possible.\n\n(5,4) is empty, I assume.\n\n(6,5) is empty? Currently occupied? No, positions: (5,5) head, (4,5), (3,5), etc., so (6,5) free, (5,4) free.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead. Where to go?\n\nThere is food at (5,1), which is south, so I should go down.\n\nBut (5,1) has life span 10, plenty of time.\n\nBut also, the tail is at (1,3), and as I move, the tail will move, so cells might free up.\n\nFor example, if I go down from (5,5) to (5,4) on turn 17, then to (5,3) on next, etc.\n\nBut let's see the direction.\n\nAfter turn 17, head at (5,5), direction was R, so now direction is R, I think, since I moved right.\n\nDirection is the last move direction.\n\nOn turn 16, I moved R to (4,5), so direction R.\n\nThen turn 17, move R to (5,5), direction R.\n\nNow turn 18, from (5,5), I can go D or R.\n\nIf I go R to (6,5), that's east, then I am at (6,5), which is near the right wall.\n\nFrom (6,5), possible moves: U to (6,6), D to (6,4), L to (5,5) but body, cannot, R to (7,5) but x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo only U or D.\n\n(6,6) is y=6, x=6, which might be free, but (5,6) is wall, but (6,6) is different.\n\n(6,6) is playable, I think.\n\nInternal obstacle only (5,6), so (6,6) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) free.\n\nBut if I go to (6,5), then I have to go up or down, and I might be stuck in the right column, away from (5,1).\n\nWhereas if I go down from (5,5) to (5,4), then I can continue down to (5,3), (5,2), (5,1) to eat the food.\n\nThat seems better.\n\nSo on turn 18, from (5,5), go D to (5,4).\n\nThen turn 19: from (5,4), I can go D to (5,3), or L to (4,4), or R to (6,4), etc.\n\nBut to reach (5,1), going down directly is good.\n\n(5,3) should be free, then (5,2), (5,1).\n\nNow, are there any obstacles? (5,1) is food, and no walls in between.\n\nBut y=1 is not wall, it's playable, since walls are y=0 and y=7.\n\ny=0 is wall, so y=1 is bottom row, playable.\n\nSimilarly, x=5, y=1.\n\nNow, when I reach (5,1), I can eat it.\n\nBut let's see the timing.\n\nTurn 18: at (5,4)\n\nTurn 19: go D to (5,3)\n\nTurn 20: go D to (5,2)\n\nTurn 21: go D to (5,1), eat food.\n\nNow, (5,1) has life span 10 at turn 16, so on turn 21, what is its life?\n\nLife span decreases each turn.\n\nAt turn 16, life 10.\n\nAfter turn 16, life 9 at start turn 17? Let's clarify the countdown.\n\nThe rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nAnd \"disappears after N turns\".\n\nI think it's better to think: at the beginning of turn t, food has life L. If not eaten during t, at beginning of t+1, life L-1. When life 0, it disappears before the turn or after?\n\nTypically, if life span N, it exists for N turns, including the current one if life>0.\n\nThe rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so for example, at turn t, if life L, during turn t, it can be eaten, and after turn t, if not eaten, life becomes L-1 for turn t+1.\n\nWhen life is 1 at turn t, it can be eaten during t, and after that, if not eaten, it disappears.\n\nFor (5,1), life 10 at turn 16. So:\n\n- Turn 16: life 10, can be eaten\n\n- After turn 16, if not eaten, life 9 at turn 17\n\n- Turn 17: life 9, can be eaten\n\n- ...\n\n- Turn 25: life 1, can be eaten\n\n- After turn 25, if not eaten, disappears.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) life 4 at turn 16:\n\n- Turn 16: life 4, can be eaten\n\n- Turn 17: life 3, can be eaten\n\n- Turn 18: life 2, can be eaten\n\n- Turn 19: life 1, can be eaten\n\n- After turn 19, disappears.\n\n(4,5) life 7:\n\n- Turn 16 to 22, can be eaten until turn 22.\n\nIn my plan, I eat (4,5) on turn 16, (5,5) on turn 17, both within their lives.\n\nThen (5,1) on turn 21, which is fine, life 10 at turn 16, on turn 21, life should be 10 - (21-16) = 5? Let's calculate:\n\nAfter each turn, life decreases if not eaten.\n\nAt start turn 16: life 10\n\nAfter turn 16: if not eaten, life 9 at start turn 17\n\nAfter turn 17: if not eaten, life 8 at start turn 18\n\n...\n\nAfter turn 20: if not eaten, life 5 at start turn 21\n\nDuring turn 21, if eaten, ok, life 5>0.\n\nSimilarly, on turn 21, I can eat it.\n\nIn my sequence, I eat on turn 21.\n\nNow, back to the snake movement.\n\nAfter eating (5,5) on turn 17, head at (5,5), direction R.\n\nTurn 18: go D to (5,4). Now direction changes to D.\n\nThen turn 19: from (5,4), possible moves: D to (5,3), L to (4,4), R to (6,4). Cannot go U because opposite to D? Current direction is D, so opposite is U, cannot go up.\n\nDirection: when I move, the direction is set to the move I made.\n\nOn turn 17, I moved R to (5,5), so direction R.\n\nTurn 18, I move D to (5,4), so now direction is D.\n\nThen turn 19, from (5,4), I want to go D to (5,3), which is same as current direction? Down, so allowed.\n\nL to (4,4) left, perpendicular, allowed.\n\nR to (6,4) right, perpendicular, allowed.\n\nU up, opposite to D, not allowed.\n\nSo I can go D to (5,3).\n\nSimilarly, turn 20: go D to (5,2)\n\nTurn 21: go D to (5,1), eat food.\n\nAfter eating (5,1), snake grows again.\n\nNow, what about the tail? During this, the tail is moving.\n\nFor example, on turn 16, after eating (4,5), tail is still (1,3)\n\nOn turn 17, after eating (5,5), tail still (1,3) because we ate, so tail doesn't move.\n\nWhen we eat, tail doesn't move, so tail remains until we move without eating.\n\nIn turn 16: moved to (4,5), ate, so tail stays at (1,3)\n\nTurn 17: moved to (5,5), ate, so tail still at (1,3)\n\nNow turn 18: move to (5,4), but no food at (5,4), so no eat, thus tail moves. The last segment is removed.\n\nCurrent positions before turn 18: head (5,5), body (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) — 9 segments.\n\nAfter moving to (5,4) without eating, head to (5,4), then body: (5,5) becomes new body, so positions: head (5,4), body: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) — and tail (1,3) is removed, so 9 segments? Head moves to new cell, if no eat, tail removed.\n\nSnake: segments list.\n\nBefore move: [ (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3) ] head first.\n\nAfter move to (5,4) no eat: new head (5,4), then add (5,5) as body, and remove tail (1,3), so new body: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) — 8 segments? Let's count: head (5,4), then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) — that's 9 cells? Positions: 1. (5,4) head, 2. (5,5), 3. (4,5), 4. (3,5), 5. (2,5), 6. (2,6), 7. (1,6), 8. (1,5), 9. (1,4) — yes 9 segments? But when no eat, length should be same, but we had 9 before, after moving without eating, we remove tail, so should be 8.\n\nBefore move: 9 segments including head.\n\nAfter move: head moves to new cell, if no food, tail is removed, so the body segments: the previous head becomes the new first body segment, and the last body segment (tail) is removed.\n\nSo new list: [new head, previous head, ... up to the second last body segment]\n\nIn this case, before move: positions index 0: head (5,5), 1: (4,5), 2: (3,5), 3: (2,5), 4: (2,6), 5: (1,6), 6: (1,5), 7: (1,4), 8: (1,3) tail.\n\nAfter move to (5,4) no eat: new head (5,4), then body: (5,5) [previous head], (4,5) [index1], (3,5) [2], (2,5) [3], (2,6) [4], (1,6) [5], (1,5) [6], (1,4) [7] — and (1,3) [8] is removed, so 8 segments: head (5,4), then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) — (1,4) is the last body, tail.\n\nPositions: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) — that's 9 cells? No: (5,4) head, (5,5) body, (4,5) body, (3,5) body, (2,5) body, (2,6) body, (1,6) body, (1,5) body, (1,4) tail — yes, but (1,4) is the tail, and we have 9 positions? I think I confused.\n\nInitial after turn 17: 9 segments.\n\nAfter moving without eating on turn 18: head moves to (5,4), which was empty, so new head at (5,4). The previous head (5,5) becomes the new neck. The tail (1,3) is removed. So the body segments are from index 1 to 7: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), and new head (5,4), so positions: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) — but (1,4) is the new tail, and we have 9 segments still? No: before move, 9 segments. After move, head to new cell, body: the previous head to the second last segment, so segments 1 to 8 become body 1 to 8, but since tail removed, the list has head + body except tail.\n\nStandard: the snake has N segments. When moving to empty cell, head moves to new position, the tail position is vacated, so the new snake has the new head and the first N-1 segments of the old body.\n\nOld positions: [P0=head, P1, P2, ..., P_{N-1}=tail]\n\nAfter move to new cell Q (no food): new head Q, then body: P0, P1, P2, ..., P_{N-2}, and P_{N-1} is removed.\n\nSo new length N.\n\nIn this case, N=9 before move.\n\nAfter move: new head at (5,4), then body: P0=(5,5), P1=(4,5), P2=(3,5), P3=(2,5), P4=(2,6), P5=(1,6), P6=(1,5), P7=(1,4) — and P8=(1,3) removed.\n\nSo new positions: head (5,4), then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) — (1,4) is tail, and there are 9 segments? (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) — that's 9, but P7 is (1,4), which was P7 before, but now it's the last body segment.\n\nIn the list, it's 9 positions, but the tail is (1,4), which was previously the second last, but after removing the old tail (1,3), (1,4) becomes the new tail.\n\nYes, length remains 9 if no growth, but we didn't eat, so length should be same, but we had 9 before, after no eat, should be 9? No, before turn 18, we had 9 segments. After moving without eating, we still have 9 segments because the head moved to new cell, and tail removed, so the number of segments is the same.\n\nFor example, initially 7 segments. After eating on turn 16, 8 segments. After eating on turn 17, 9 segments. Then on turn 18, no eat, move to (5,4), so head new, tail removed, so still 9 segments.\n\nThen turn 19: move to (5,3) no eat, still 9 segments, tail moves.\n\nSimilarly, turn 20: to (5,2) no eat, 9 segments.\n\nTurn 21: to (5,1), eat food, so grow, now 10 segments, tail doesn't move.\n\nPositions: head (5,1), body: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) — but after turn 20, before turn 21, positions: let's not digress.\n\nThe point is, I can eat all three foods in this sequence.\n\nBut is there any risk?\n\nIn the beginning, the snake body is on the left, and I move right to eat the foods.\n\nBut when I go down to (5,1), the tail is at (1,4) or something, but it should be fine.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (5,6), but I'm not going there.\n\nAlso, the tail reward danger: at some point, if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, but in this case, tail is moving, and I'm eating food, so tail doesn't have food, I think.\n\nThe food is on the grid, not on the snake.\n\nThe danger is when the tail cell has food, meaning when the tail is on a food cell, and head is adjacent, eating that food causes collision because after eating, the tail doesn't move, but a new segment is added, so head and new tail at same position? No.\n\nThe rule: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nSo, if the tail is on a food cell, and head moves to an adjacent cell, then if head moves to the tail cell to eat the food, but the tail cell is occupied by tail, so head cannot move there because it's occupied.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"the head moves onto the food cell\" — but if the food is under the tail, the head can only eat it if the tail moves away first.\n\nFrom the rule: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if: 1. The body moves away, and 2. The head moves onto the food cell.\"\n\nSo, if food is under body, it can be eaten only after the body moves away and head moves there.\n\nFor the tail, specifically: if tail is on food, and head is adjacent, if tail moves away, then the food is exposed, and head can move to it to eat.\n\nBut when head moves to it, if it was tail, after tail moves, it's empty with food, head moves there, eats, then since it grows, the tail doesn't move, so the previous position of tail is now the new tail, but since tail moved, the cell is free except for food.\n\nI think the danger is when head is adjacent to tail, and tail cell has food, meaning that the cell under tail has food, and if head moves to that cell right after tail moves, it eats, but then the new tail is added at the head position, so head and new tail at same cell, collision.\n\nYes: \"because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nSo, to avoid, don't eat food that is under the tail when head is adjacent.\n\nIn this state, currently, tail is at (1,3), is there food? Food at (5,5), (4,5), (5,1), not at (1,3), so no issue.\n\nAfter moves, tail moves, but no food under tail, I think.\n\nIn my sequence, on turn 16, tail at (1,3), no food.\n\nAfter turn 16, tail still (1,3) since ate.\n\nAfter turn 17, tail still (1,3) since ate.\n\nAfter turn 18, move to (5,4) no eat, so tail moves to (1,4)? Before turn 18, positions include (1,4) and (1,3) tail.\n\nAfter move, tail removed, so new tail is (1,4), which was the previous second last.\n\n(1,4) has no food.\n\nSimilarly, later, no food under tail cells, so no issue.\n\nTherefore, my plan seems safe.\n\nBut I need to output for multiple turns.\n\nThe answer should be a sequence of actions starting from turn 16.\n\nIn my plan, I have:\n\nTurn 16: R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 17: R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 18: D to (5,4)\n\nTurn 19: D to (5,3)\n\nTurn 20: D to (5,2)\n\nTurn 21: D to (5,1)\n\nBut I need to think 5+ turns ahead, so up to turn 21 or so.\n\nAfter turn 21, I eat (5,1), then I need to survive and find more food, but there is no more food mentioned, so I should just avoid dying.\n\nBut the food might respawn or something? The state only gives current food, I think no respawn, so after eating all, no more food, so I need to survive as long as possible without food, but since no negative food, I can just move safely.\n\nBut for now, with given food, I can eat all three.\n\nIn the sequence above, on turn 18,19,20, I go down, but are there any collisions?\n\nFor example, on turn 19, from (5,4) to (5,3), is (5,3) free? Yes.\n\nTurn 20: (5,2) free.\n\nTurn 21: (5,1) has food, so eat.\n\nNow, after that, head at (5,1), direction D.\n\nThen I can go left or right, since down is wall or invalid.\n\ny=1, D to (5,0) but y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nU to (5,2) but that is body, since just came from there? After eating (5,1), positions: head (5,1), body: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) — 12 segments? After turn 21, with growth.\n\nBut (5,2) is body, so cannot go up.\n\nL to (4,1), or R to (6,1).\n\nBoth should be free.\n\nSay, go left to (4,1), etc.\n\nBut for the sequence, I need to output up to a few turns.\n\nThe answer format says to output for turn 16, 17, etc., but not specified how many, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should output at least 5 actions or so.\n\nTurn 16 to 20 or 21.\n\nBut in the sequence, for turn 16 to 21 I have actions.\n\nBut let's confirm if all moves are valid.\n\nAnother thing: at the beginning, when I move to (4,5) on turn 16, is there any issue?\n\nHead at (3,5), move R to (4,5), which has food, so eat.\n\n(4,5) is not occupied by body? Current body: (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), etc., not (4,5), so yes free except food.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) not occupied.\n\nIn the body, (1,5) is occupied, but (4,5) is not.\n\nNow, what about the direction: current direction R, I move R, so no problem.\n\nThen turn 17, from (4,5), direction R (since last move R), move R to (5,5), eat.\n\nThen turn 18, from (5,5), direction R, but I move D to (5,4). Is D perpendicular, so allowed? Yes, not opposite.\n\nOpposite of R is L, D is down, perpendicular.\n\nThen turn 19, from (5,4), direction D, move D to (5,3), same direction, allowed.\n\nTurn 20, from (5,3), direction D, move D to (5,2), allowed.\n\nTurn 21, from (5,2), direction D, move D to (5,1), eat.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, for the output, I need to list the actions.\n\nBut the turn numbers: current turn 16, so:\n\nTurn 16: R\n\nTurn 17: R\n\nTurn 18: D\n\nTurn 19: D\n\nTurn 20: D\n\nTurn 21: D\n\nBut turn 21 is beyond 5 turns? 5 turns ahead from 16: 16,17,18,19,20, so 5 actions including turn 16? Think 5+ turns ahead, so planning for multiple turns.\n\nI can output up to turn 20 or 21.\n\nBut after turn 21, I need to continue, but I can stop after eating the last food or something.\n\nSince the food at (5,1) is eaten on turn 21, and no more food, but for the sequence, I can output until turn 20 or 21.\n\nPerhaps output for 5 turns: 16 to 20.\n\nBut on turn 20, I go to (5,2), and on 21 to (5,1) to eat.\n\nBut in the output, I can include up to the eat.\n\nBut the problem says \"maximize score\", so eating all food is good.\n\nIs there a better move?\n\nFor example, on turn 16, if I go D or U instead.\n\nSuppose I go U to (3,6) on turn 16.\n\nThen, (3,6) is free, no food.\n\nThen from (3,6), direction U (since moved up).\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,7) but y=7 wall, invalid.\n\nD to (3,5) which is body, collision.\n\nL to (2,6) which is body.\n\nR to (4,6) which should be free.\n\nSo only possible move is R to (4,6).\n\nThen turn 17: move R to (4,6).\n\nNow at (4,6), direction R.\n\nThen from (4,6), possible moves: U to (4,7) wall invalid.\n\nD to (4,5) which has food.\n\nL to (3,6) body.\n\nR to (5,6) but (5,6) is wall, invalid.\n\nSo only D to (4,5).\n\nThen turn 18: move D to (4,5), eat food.\n\nBut (4,5) was food, I eat it now, later than before.\n\nSimilarly, then from (4,5), I can go to (5,5) if possible.\n\nBut (5,5) might disappear if I delay.\n\nIn this case, I eat (4,5) on turn 18, but (4,5) life span 7, at turn 16 life 7, turn 18 life 5? After turn 16, if not eaten, life 6 turn 17, after turn 17 not eaten, life 5 turn 18, so I can eat on turn 18.\n\nBut (5,5) life 4 at turn 16, turn 18 life 2, so I can still eat.\n\nBut from (4,5) after eating, on turn 18, I can go R to (5,5) to eat, if I want.\n\nBut compared to my first plan, I eat (4,5) later, and (5,5) later, but (5,5) might be at risk if I wait.\n\nIn first plan, I eat both by turn 17, so safer.\n\nAlso, in this alternative, I wasted moves going up and right.\n\nSo not better.\n\nIf I go down on turn 16, to (3,4), then I go away from the food.\n\nThen I might miss (5,5) if it disappears.\n\nSo first plan is better.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with the sequence to eat the foods directly.\n\nNow for the answer, output actions from turn 16.\n\nI think output until turn 21 to include eating all.\n\nBut the format might expect a fixed number, or I can do as per plan.\n\nSince \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I can output 6 actions: turn 16 to 21.\n\nIn the boxed format.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 16: \\text{R} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: \\text{R} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: \\text{D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: \\text{D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: \\text{D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 21: \\text{D} }\n\nBut turn 21 D to (5,1) to eat.\n\nAnd I think that's fine.\n\nTo be precise, let's write the action for each turn.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I have planned a sequence of moves for turns 16 to 21, thinking 5+ turns ahead. The plan prioritizes eating all available positive food (at (4,5), (5,5), and (5,1)) while avoiding collisions with walls, obstacles, and the snake's body. Key considerations:\n\n- **Food urgency**: (5,5) has a life span of 4 at turn 16, disappearing after turn 19. Eating it by turn 17 is efficient. (4,5) has a longer life span (7), and (5,1) has ample time (life span 10).\n- **Path efficiency**: From the starting position (3,5) with direction R, moving right to (4,5) on turn 16 eats the food immediately. Continuing right to (5,5) on turn 17 eats the second food. Then, moving down sequentially from (5,5) to (5,1) allows eating the third food by turn 21.\n- **Collision avoidance**: \n  - The internal obstacle at (5,6) blocks upward movement from (5,5), but the plan moves down instead.\n  - The snake grows when eating, so tail movement is managed to prevent \"tail reward danger\" (no food under tail in this sequence).\n  - Direction constraints are respected (e.g., no instant reverse).\n- **Risk minimization**: Eating all food quickly minimizes the risk of starvation or missing time-sensitive food. After turn 21, the snake can navigate safely to open areas (e.g., left or right from (5,1)) as no more food is present.\n\n**Planned Moves**:\n- **Turn 16 (start)**: Move R to (4,5) – Eat positive food (+1 score, snake length increases to 8). Direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 17**: Move R to (5,5) – Eat positive food (+1 score, snake length increases to 9). Direction becomes R.\n- **Turn 18**: Move D to (5,4) – No food, so tail moves (snake length remains 9). Direction becomes D.\n- **Turn 19**: Move D to (5,3) – No food, tail moves. Direction remains D.\n- **Turn 20**: Move D to (5,2) – No food, tail moves. Direction remains D.\n- **Turn 21**: Move D to (5,1) – Eat positive food (+1 score, snake length increases to 10). Direction becomes D.\n\nThis sequence scores 3 points by turn 21 and positions the snake for safe movement afterward. If executed, the snake will have eaten all food by turn 21 with no collision risks during the sequence.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 16: \\text{R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 17: \\text{R} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 18: \\text{D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 19: \\text{D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 20: \\text{D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 21: \\text{D}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 17, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The walls are at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,6). The grid size isn't specified, but from the walls, it seems like the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, since walls are at 0 and 7. Let me confirm that.\n\nThe walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so cells from (1,1) to (6,6) should be playable, except for obstacles. The obstacle is at (5,6), which is within that.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (4,5), then (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3). So the snake has 8 segments. Head direction is R, meaning it's moving right.\n\nFood: two pieces:\n\n- (5,5) with value 1 and life span 3. That means it disappears after 3 turns, including the current turn, so after turn 17, it has 3 turns left? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 17, life span is 3, meaning it will disappear after turn 19 (since it decreases each turn: after turn 17, it becomes 2; after turn 18, it becomes 1; after turn 19, it disappears).\n\nSimilarly, (5,1) with value 1 and life span 9, so it has 9 turns left, disappearing after turn 25.\n\nBoth foods have value +1, so positive food.\n\nNow, I need to plan moves for multiple turns ahead. The instruction says to think 5+ turns ahead, so I should plan for at least 5 turns: turns 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.\n\nBut the answer format is to output actions starting from turn 17 onwards, for several turns. I need to decide how many turns to plan. Since the food has limited life, I should aim to eat the food at (5,5) soon because it disappears quickly.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid: rows y=0 to 7, but walls at y=0 and y=7, so playable y=1 to 6. Similarly x=1 to 6.\n\nObstacle at (5,6).\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- Head: (4,5)\n\n- Body: (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)\n\nSo let's list the positions:\n\n- (1,3) tail\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (1,5)\n\n- (1,6)\n\n- (2,6)\n\n- (2,5)\n\n- (3,5)\n\n- (4,5) head\n\nHead is at (4,5) moving right, so direction R.\n\nAvailable moves: since head is moving right, I can go U (up), D (down), or R (right), but not L (left) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. The rule says \"no instant reverse\", so from right, I can't go left immediately.\n\nSo possible actions at turn 17: U, D, R.\n\nNow, food at (5,5) and (5,1).\n\n(5,5) is directly to the right of head at (4,5), so if I go R, I move to (5,5) and eat the food, since it's positive.\n\nBut I need to check for risks, especially the tail reward danger.\n\nFirst, if I go R to (5,5), I eat the food. Value +1, snake length increases by 1.\n\nBut after eating, the tail doesn't move immediately? When the snake eats food, it grows, so the tail stays in place for that turn, I think. Standard Snake mechanics: when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n\nIn terms of movement: on a turn when you eat, head moves to food, but the body segments don't advance, so the tail remains, and a new segment is added at the head position. Then next turn, when you move, the tail moves.\n\nBut in this case, for collision: after eating, the snake is longer, and positions include the new head.\n\nNow, specifically, tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this state, the tail is at (1,3). Is there food at the tail? The food is at (5,5) and (5,1), not at tail. Tail is at (1,3), no food there. So no issue.\n\nBut I need to see the future positions.\n\nAlso, collision with body or walls.\n\nIf I go R to (5,5), that's within grid, x=5,y=5. Walls are at x=0,7 y=0,7, so (5,5) is fine. Obstacle at (5,6), not (5,5), so safe.\n\nNow, after moving to (5,5), the new head position is (5,5), and since I ate food, the snake grows: positions become [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)]? Let's see: head was at (4,5), moves to (5,5), so new head (5,5). Body segments: the second segment was (3,5), but since we ate, we add a new segment, so the body doesn't move. So positions: head is (5,5), then the previous positions except tail stays? Standard: the tail remains, and a new head is added.\n\nInitial positions: [head, seg1, seg2, ..., tail]\n\nAfter move without eating: head moves to new position, each segment moves to previous position of the one before, tail is removed.\n\nAfter eating: head moves to new position (food), each segment stays, and a new segment is added at the end, so tail doesn't change position, but now there's an extra segment.\n\nIn this case, before move: positions: index 0: head (4,5), 1: (3,5), 2: (2,5), 3: (2,6), 4: (1,6), 5: (1,5), 6: (1,4), 7: (1,3) tail.\n\nAfter moving R and eating at (5,5): new head is (5,5). Since we ate, the body segments don't move, so positions become: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)] but (1,3) is still there, and we add a new segment? No.\n\nWhen eating, the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added to the body, so the tail remains in place, but the length increases by one.\n\nSo the new positions are: the new head at (5,5), then the previous head position (4,5) becomes the new second segment, and so on, down to the tail (1,3), which is still there, and since we added a segment, the tail doesn't move.\n\nSo positions: head (5,5), then (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3). That's 9 positions now.\n\n(1,3) is still the tail.\n\nNow, for turn 18, head is at (5,5), direction was R, but after moving, the new direction depends on what I do next.\n\nI need to think multiple turns.\n\nBut let's consider other options at turn 17.\n\nI could go U or D instead of R.\n\nIf I go U from (4,5), to (4,6).\n\nIs (4,6) safe? Walls: y=6 is not a wall, y=7 is wall, but playable up to y=6? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is playable. x=4 is fine. Obstacle at (5,6), not (4,6).\n\nAlso, is (4,6) occupied? Snake positions: (4,5) is head, (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3). So (4,6) is not occupied, so safe to move.\n\nSimilarly, if I go D to (4,4), which should be empty and within bounds.\n\ny=4, x=4, should be fine.\n\nBut (4,4) might be occupied? Positions: (1,4) is there, but (1,4) is at x=1,y=4, (4,4) is different, so empty.\n\nNow, food at (5,5) is close, life span 3, so if I don't eat it now, it might disappear soon.\n\nBut I need to think long-term.\n\nAlso, there's food at (5,1), which is far, life span 9, so I have time.\n\nBut the snake is long, 8 segments, and the grid is small, only 6x6 playable area? x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, so 6x6=36 cells, minus obstacle at (5,6), so 35 cells, snake has 8 segments, so plenty of space, but I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nLet me sketch the grid:\n\ny=6: cells (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6) obstacle, (6,6)\n\nBut (5,6) is obstacle, so not accessible.\n\ny=5: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) head, (5,5) food, (6,5)\n\ny=4: (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4)\n\ny=3: (1,3) tail, (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)\n\ny=2: (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2)\n\ny=1: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) food, (6,1)\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- (4,5) head\n\n- (3,5)\n\n- (2,5)\n\n- (2,6)\n\n- (1,6)\n\n- (1,5)\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (1,3) tail\n\nSo the snake is mostly on the left side, from (1,3) to (4,5), with a detour to (2,6) and (1,6).\n\nNow, food at (5,5) is adjacent right.\n\nIf I go R to (5,5) at turn 17, I eat it.\n\nThen head at (5,5), snake length 9.\n\nNow for turn 18, from (5,5), possible moves: U, D, L, R? But direction: after moving R, the head is now at (5,5), and I need to choose next direction.\n\nNo instant reverse, so from current direction R, I can't go L (left), but since I just arrived at (5,5) from left, the incoming direction is left? Let's think carefully.\n\nThe snake head direction is given as R at turn 17, meaning it was moving right to reach (4,5)? No.\n\nAt turn 17, the snake positions are given, with head at (4,5), and head direction R. That means the snake was moving right to get to (4,5) from previous position.\n\nPrevious position: before turn 17, at turn 16, head was at (3,5), moved right to (4,5) for turn 17? Positions are given for turn 17, so at the start of turn 17, snake is at these positions, and head direction is R, meaning that on turn 17, it is facing right, so from (4,5), it can move right, up, or down.\n\nAfter moving, the new head position determines the new direction.\n\nFor turn 18, after moving to (5,5) on turn 17, head is at (5,5), and the direction it moved to get there is right, so on turn 18, it can move U, D, R, but not L (since left would be reverse).\n\nSimilarly for other moves.\n\nBack to turn 17 options.\n\nOption 1: Move R to (5,5), eat food. Then for turn 18, from (5,5), I can go U, D, or R.\n\nIf I go U to (5,6), but (5,6) is an obstacle! Obstacle at (5,6), so I can't go there. Wall collision.\n\nSo from (5,5), U is invalid.\n\nD to (5,4), which should be empty.\n\nR to (6,5), which is within bounds, x=6<7, y=5.\n\nx=6 is playable, since walls at x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is ok.\n\nSimilarly, L to (4,5), but L is left, which is reverse of current direction? Current direction when at (5,5) for turn 18: since I moved right to get to (5,5), the direction into (5,5) is from left, so moving left would be back to (4,5), which is reverse, so not allowed. So L is invalid.\n\nTherefore, from (5,5) after eating, on turn 18, possible moves: D or R. U is obstacle, L is reverse.\n\nD to (5,4) or R to (6,5).\n\nNow, (5,4) is empty, (6,5) is empty.\n\nBut I need to think further.\n\nIf I don't eat at turn 17, I could go U or D.\n\nFor example, go U to (4,6) at turn 17.\n\n(4,6) is empty, no food there, so just move, no growth.\n\nThen positions: head moves to (4,6), body: since no eat, tail moves, so positions become [(4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)] tail at (1,4).\n\n(1,3) is gone.\n\nSimilarly, if go D to (4,4), positions [(4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)] tail at (1,4)? Let's see: from initial, head to (4,4), then (4,5) becomes second, (3,5) third, etc., down to (1,6) was position 4, but after move, positions: head (4,4), then previous head (4,5), then (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) and (1,3) is tail, but since no eat, tail is removed, so the last segment (1,3) is gone, so positions: (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) — 8 segments, tail at (1,4).\n\nInitial positions: 8 segments, after move no eat, still 8 segments, tail moved.\n\nNow, at turn 17, if I go U to (4,6), then food at (5,5) is still there, but now I'm at (4,6), so I can go to (5,5) from there? From (4,6), to (5,5) is down-right, but moves are only up, down, left, right, not diagonal. So from (4,6), I can go R to (5,6), but (5,6) is obstacle, or L to (3,6), or U to (4,7) but y=7 wall, or D to (4,5).\n\nD to (4,5) is down, to (4,5), which is currently occupied by the body? After moving to (4,6) on turn 17, positions are [(4,6), (4,5), (3,5), ...] so (4,5) is the second segment, so if I go D to (4,5) on turn 18, that would be collision with body at (4,5).\n\nSo not possible.\n\nFrom (4,6), possible moves on turn 18: direction to (4,6) was from down? At turn 17, I moved U to (4,6), so from (4,5) to (4,6), direction up.\n\nSo on turn 18, from (4,6), I can go L, R, U? U to (4,7) y=7 wall, invalid. D to (4,5) but that's where I came from, and it's now occupied by body, so collision. L to (3,6) or R to (5,6) but (5,6) obstacle.\n\nSo only possible move is L to (3,6).\n\n(3,6) should be empty.\n\nSimilarly, if I go D at turn 17 to (4,4), then from there, I can go to (5,4), (4,3), (4,5) but (4,5) is body, or (3,4), etc.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (5,5) with short life.\n\nIf I don't eat it at turn 17, it has life span 3, so after turn 17, it becomes 2, then after turn 18, it becomes 1, after turn 19 it disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 17, 18, or 19.\n\nAt turn 17, I can eat it by going R.\n\nIf I go U or D, I might not be able to eat it later.\n\nFor example, if I go U to (4,6) on turn 17, then on turn 18 I have to go L to (3,6), as above.\n\nThen at turn 18, head at (3,6), food at (5,5) still there, life span now 2.\n\nFrom (3,6), I can go to (3,5), (3,7) wall, (2,6), or (4,6).\n\n(3,5) is occupied? Positions: after turn 17 U move: [(4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)] tail at (1,4)\n\nThen turn 18, go L to (3,6)? From (4,6) to (3,6) is left.\n\nNew head (3,6), positions: [(3,6), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)] tail at (1,5)? After move no eat, so head to (3,6), then (4,6) becomes second, (4,5) third, (3,5) fourth, (2,5) fifth, (2,6) sixth, (1,6) seventh, (1,5) tail, and (1,4) is gone.\n\n(1,5) is tail.\n\nNow at (3,6), food at (5,5) is at distance. To reach (5,5) from (3,6), I need to go right and down, but not directly.\n\nPossible moves from (3,6): U to (3,7) wall, invalid; D to (3,5); L to (2,6); R to (4,6).\n\n(3,5) is occupied? Positions: (3,5) is the fourth segment, so if I go D to (3,5), collision.\n\n(2,6) is the sixth segment, occupied.\n\n(4,6) is the second segment, occupied.\n\nSo from (3,6), all possible moves are to occupied cells or walls: D to (3,5) body, L to (2,6) body, R to (4,6) body, U wall. So I would die immediately on turn 18 if I went U on turn 17.\n\nThat's a problem.\n\nIf I go U on turn 17 to (4,6), then on turn 18 I have no safe move; all adjacent cells are blocked.\n\n(4,6) adjacent: up (4,7) wall; down (4,5) body; left (3,6)? (3,6) is empty? After turn 17, positions: head at (4,6), then (4,5), (3,5), etc. (3,6) is not occupied, as per positions.\n\nIn the grid, (3,6) should be free. After turn 17 move U, positions: [(4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)]\n\nSo cells: (4,6) head, (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)\n\n(3,6) is not in the list, so it should be empty.\n\nSimilarly, (5,6) obstacle, (4,7) wall, (3,6) is free.\n\nFrom (4,6), I can go L to (3,6), which is free, as I said earlier.\n\nThen on turn 18, go L to (3,6).\n\nThen positions: head at (3,6), then (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) tail.\n\nNow (3,5) is occupied, but it's not adjacent to head? Head at (3,6), adjacent: (3,5) down, (3,7) up wall, (2,6) left, (4,6) right.\n\n(3,5) is down, which is occupied by the body segment (3,5).\n\n(2,6) is left, which is also occupied, (2,6) is in positions.\n\n(4,6) is right, occupied.\n\n(3,7) up wall.\n\nSo all adjacent cells are either wall or occupied, so no possible move, death.\n\nTherefore, going U on turn 17 leads to death on turn 18.\n\nSimilarly, if I go D on turn 17 to (4,4).\n\nAt turn 17, go D to (4,4).\n\nPositions after: [(4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)] tail at (1,4)? (1,3) gone, tail at (1,4).\n\nInitial tail was (1,3), after move no eat, removed, so tail is (1,4).\n\nPositions: head (4,4), then (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)\n\nNow from (4,4) on turn 18, possible moves: U to (4,5), but (4,5) is second segment, occupied, collision.\n\nD to (4,3), which might be empty.\n\nL to (3,4), might be empty.\n\nR to (5,4), might be empty.\n\nBut U is to (4,5), occupied, so invalid.\n\nNow direction: at turn 17, I moved D to (4,4), so direction down, so on turn 18, I can't go U (up) because instant reverse.\n\nBut U is also occupied, so definitely invalid.\n\nSo possible: D to (4,3), L to (3,4), R to (5,4).\n\n(4,3) should be empty, (3,4) empty, (5,4) empty.\n\nSo I can go to those.\n\nFor example, go R to (5,4), then I might be closer to food at (5,5).\n\nBut let's see the food situation.\n\nAt turn 17, if I go D to (4,4), I don't eat the food at (5,5), so it remains.\n\nLife span decreases to 2 after turn 17.\n\nThen on turn 18, if I go to (5,4), for example.\n\nBut back to turn 17 decision.\n\nIf I go R to (5,5) at turn 17, I eat the food, snake grows to 9 segments.\n\nHead at (5,5), and as before, on turn 18, I can go D to (5,4) or R to (6,5).\n\nNow, if I go to (5,4), no food there.\n\nOr (6,5), no food.\n\nBut the food at (5,5) is eaten, so gone.\n\nNow there's another food at (5,1), with life span 9.\n\nAlso, I need to think about survival.\n\nAfter eating at (5,5), snake is longer, which might make it harder to maneuver.\n\nBut let's simulate the moves.\n\nFirst, at turn 17, go R to (5,5), eat food. New positions: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)] 9 segments.\n\nNow turn 18, from (5,5), I can go D to (5,4) or R to (6,5).\n\nSay I go D to (5,4). No food there, so just move.\n\nThen positions: head to (5,4), since no eat, tail moves, so tail (1,3) is removed, new positions: [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)] tail at (1,4).\n\n(1,3) gone.\n\nNow head at (5,4), direction down (since moved D from (5,5)).\n\nOn turn 19, possible moves: from (5,4), can go L to (4,4), R to (6,4), U to (5,5), or D to (5,3).\n\nU to (5,5) is up, but current direction is down, so U is reverse, not allowed.\n\nAlso, (5,5) is occupied by second segment.\n\nSo U invalid.\n\nL to (4,4), R to (6,4), D to (5,3).\n\nAll might be empty.\n\n(4,4) should be empty, (6,4) empty, (5,3) empty.\n\nSimilarly, I could go R to (6,5) on turn 18.\n\nBut let's consider the other food at (5,1).\n\nIt has long life, so not urgent.\n\nBut the grid is small, and snake is long, I need to avoid boxing myself in.\n\nAnother thing: the tail is at (1,4) or something, so as the snake moves, the tail moves, freeing up space.\n\nAt turn 17, if I don't eat, the tail moves, freeing (1,3).\n\nBut in the case where I go U or D, it might be risky.\n\nFrom above, going U at turn 17 leads to death, so U is not viable.\n\nGoing D at turn 17 to (4,4) is possible.\n\nThen on turn 18, from (4,4), I can go to (5,4), (4,3), or (3,4).\n\nFood at (5,5) is still there with life span 2 (after turn 17).\n\nIf I go to (5,4) on turn 18, then from (5,4), I can go to (5,5) on turn 19, but (5,5) has food, and life span decreases to 1 after turn 18, so on turn 19 it can be eaten if I move there.\n\nLet's see.\n\nAt turn 17: go D to (4,4), no eat. Positions: [(4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)] tail at (1,4)\n\nFood at (5,5) life span now 2 (after turn 17).\n\nTurn 18: from (4,4), I go R to (5,4), for example. No food, so move. Positions: head to (5,4), then (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) tail, but after move no eat, tail (1,4) removed? Positions: initial for turn 18 is [(4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)]\n\nAfter move to (5,4): new head (5,4), then (4,4) becomes second, (4,5) third, (3,5) fourth, (2,5) fifth, (2,6) sixth, (1,6) seventh, (1,5) tail, and (1,4) gone.\n\nTail at (1,5).\n\nFood at (5,5) life span 2, after turn 18 it becomes 1.\n\nTurn 19: head at (5,4), I can go to (5,5) to eat food, since (5,5) is adjacent up.\n\nBut direction: I moved to (5,4) from left? At turn 18, I moved from (4,4) to (5,4) right, so direction right.\n\nOn turn 19, from (5,4), I can go U to (5,5), which is up, not reverse, so possible.\n\n(5,5) has food, so eat it.\n\nThen new positions: head to (5,5), and since eat, body doesn't move, new segment added, so positions: [(5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)] and new tail? Initial positions before turn 19: [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)]\n\nAfter move to (5,5) and eat: new head (5,5), then (5,4) second, (4,4) third, (4,5) fourth, (3,5) fifth, (2,5) sixth, (2,6) seventh, (1,6) eighth, (1,5) ninth, and since ate, add new segment, so tail is still (1,5), but with new segment, positions: [(5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)] — 9 segments, tail at (1,5).\n\n(1,5) is the tail, and it doesn't move.\n\nThen life span of food decreases, but eaten, so gone.\n\nSo in this case, I can eat the food at (5,5) on turn 19 instead of turn 17.\n\nBut the snake grows later, but I still get the point.\n\nHowever, by delaying, I risk the food disappearing or not being able to reach it.\n\nIn this case, I was able to reach it.\n\nBut if I had gone a different way, it might not be possible.\n\nFor example, if at turn 18 I go to (4,3) instead of (5,4), then from (4,3), it might be harder to reach (5,5) in time.\n\nBut since life span allows until turn 19, and from (4,4), going to (5,4) is direct.\n\nNow, compare to eating at turn 17: if I eat at 17, snake is longer earlier, which might cause issues.\n\nBut in this small grid, with 9 segments out of 35 cells, it might be ok.\n\nBut let's think about the path after eating.\n\nAlso, there is the food at (5,1) to consider.\n\nMoreover, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nSo let's plan for turns 17 to 21.\n\nFirst, at turn 17, I have three choices: R, U, D.\n\nU is suicidal, as we saw, because it leads to no move on turn 18.\n\nSo U is out.\n\nD is possible, but let's see.\n\nR is also possible.\n\nNow, if I go R at 17, eat food, head at (5,5), then on turn 18, I must go D or R.\n\nIf I go R to (6,5), for example.\n\n(6,5) is empty, no food.\n\nPositions: after turn 17 eat: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)]\n\nTurn 18 go R to (6,5), no eat, so move: head to (6,5), then (5,5) second, (4,5) third, etc., tail (1,3) removed, positions: [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)] tail at (1,4).\n\nHead at (6,5), direction right.\n\nOn turn 19, possible moves: U to (6,6), D to (6,4), L to (5,5), but L is left, reverse, not allowed. R to (7,5) x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo only U or D.\n\n(6,6) might be empty or not. Positions: (1,6) is there, but (6,6) is different, should be empty.\n\nSimilarly (6,4) empty.\n\nSay go D to (6,4).\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut I'm near the wall.\n\nSimilarly, if from (5,5) on turn 18 I go D to (5,4), as before.\n\nThen on turn 19, from (5,4), I can go L to (4,4), R to (6,4), D to (5,3), but not U.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut to maximize score, I should also aim for the other food at (5,1).\n\n(5,1) is at the bottom, life span 9, so I have time.\n\nBut with the snake long, I need to path to it.\n\nNow, back to turn 17 decision.\n\nIf I go D at turn 17 to (4,4), then on turn 18 I can go to (5,4), then on turn 19 to (5,5) to eat, as I thought.\n\nThen I eat at turn 19 instead of 17.\n\nThe score is the same, +1, but I delay the growth.\n\nIn terms of survival, having the snake shorter for longer might be better, but here the difference is small.\n\nAnother point: by eating at turn 17, I free the cell (5,5) earlier, but since food is there, it's occupied anyway.\n\nBut after eating, it's part of snake.\n\nI think both are possible.\n\nBut let's consider the tail reward danger for the other food.\n\nThe food at (5,1) is not near tail now.\n\nTail is at (1,3) or (1,4), far from (5,1).\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should go for the immediate food to avoid risk of not getting it.\n\nSince life span is short, and I can eat it safely at turn 17.\n\nGoing U is bad, so between R and D.\n\nIf I go D at turn 17, to (4,4), then I need to go to (5,4) on turn 18 to set up for eating on turn 19.\n\nBut on turn 18, from (4,4), I could go to (4,3) or (3,4), but that might not lead to the food.\n\nFor example, if I go to (4,3) on turn 18, then from (4,3), on turn 19 I can go to (5,3) or (4,2), but not to (5,5) directly, and food at (5,5) disappears after turn 19, so if I don't eat on turn 19, I lose it.\n\nFrom (4,3), to (5,5) is two moves away, but on turn 19, I can only move to adjacent, so (5,3), (4,2), (4,4), (3,3), not (5,5). So I cannot reach (5,5) on turn 19 from (4,3), so I miss the food.\n\nTherefore, to ensure I eat the food at (5,5), I need to be in a position to move to it on turn 18 or 19.\n\nAt turn 17, if I am at (4,5), going R eats it immediately.\n\nIf I go D to (4,4), then on turn 18 I must go to a cell adjacent to (5,5), which is (5,4) or (5,6) or (4,5) or (6,5).\n\n(5,6) is obstacle, (4,5) is occupied if I go there, (6,5) is not adjacent from (4,4), only (5,4) is adjacent to both (4,4) and (5,5).\n\nFrom (4,4), (5,4) is adjacent and also adjacent to (5,5).\n\nSo by going to (5,4) on turn 18, I can then go to (5,5) on turn 19.\n\nIf I go to other places on turn 18, I might not reach it.\n\nSo to be safe, for turn 17, if I choose D, I must commit to going to (5,4) on turn 18.\n\nSimilarly, if I go R on turn 17, I eat it directly.\n\nNow, comparing the two:\n\n- If eat at turn 17: snake grows to 9 immediately, and I'm at (5,5) with fewer movement options on turn 18 (only D or R).\n\n- If eat at turn 19: snake remains shorter for two more turns, and I can position better.\n\nBut since I get the point either way, and the grid is not too cramped, it might not matter much.\n\nBut let's think about the future food at (5,1).\n\nTo reach (5,1), I need to go down.\n\nAlso, the tail is moving, freeing space.\n\nFor long-term survival, I should avoid areas where I might get trapped.\n\nAnother idea: after eating at (5,5), if I go D to (5,4) on turn 18, then I can head down towards (5,1).\n\nSimilarly from (4,4), I can go down.\n\nBut let's see the answer format; I need to output multiple turns.\n\nPerhaps I should simulate a sequence.\n\nSince the food at (5,5) is critical, I should eat it at turn 17 to be safe.\n\nAnd U is not an option, D might be ok but risk missing the food if I don't plan properly.\n\nSo I think going R at turn 17 is the safest for eating the food.\n\nThen for turn 18, from (5,5), I can go D to (5,4) to start moving down.\n\nR to (6,5) is also possible, but (6,5) is corner, might be riskier.\n\nSo go D to (5,4).\n\nThen on turn 19, from (5,4), as before, I can go D to (5,3), L to (4,4), R to (6,4), etc.\n\nNow, to reach (5,1), I can go down step by step.\n\nAlso, the tail is moving; for example, tail is at (1,3) initially, but as I move, it moves.\n\nBut let's outline a plan.\n\nTurn 17: R to (5,5) eat food.\n\nTurn 18: from (5,5), go D to (5,4) (since U and L invalid, R possible but let's go down).\n\nAfter turn 17: positions [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)]\n\nTurn 18: go D to (5,4), no food, so move: head to (5,4), then (5,5) second, (4,5) third, etc., tail (1,3) removed, positions: [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)] tail at (1,4)\n\nHead at (5,4), direction down.\n\nTurn 19: from (5,4), can go D to (5,3), L to (4,4), R to (6,4). U to (5,5) is reverse and occupied, invalid.\n\n(5,3) might be empty, let's go D to (5,3) to move down.\n\nNo food, positions: head to (5,3), then (5,4) second, (5,5) third, (4,5) fourth, (3,5) fifth, (2,5) sixth, (2,6) seventh, (1,6) eighth, (1,5) tail, (1,4) gone? After move, tail removed, so positions: [(5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)] tail at (1,5)\n\nHead at (5,3), direction down.\n\nTurn 20: from (5,3), can go D to (5,2), L to (4,3), R to (6,3). U to (5,4) reverse, invalid.\n\nGo D to (5,2), no food.\n\nPositions: head to (5,2), then (5,3) second, (5,4) third, (5,5) fourth, (4,5) fifth, etc., tail (1,5) removed, positions: [(5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)] tail at (1,6)\n\nHead at (5,2), direction down.\n\nTurn 21: from (5,2), can go D to (5,1), which has food! (5,1) has value 1, life span 9.\n\nAt turn 21, life span: initial at turn 17 life span 9, after turn 17,18,19,20, so after turn 20, life span decreases to 9-4=5? Let's calculate.\n\nAt turn 17, food at (5,1) life span 9.\n\nAfter turn 17, life span decreases to 8.\n\nAfter turn 18, to 7.\n\nAfter turn 19, to 6.\n\nAfter turn 20, to 5.\n\nAfter turn 21, to 4, etc.\n\nSo at turn 21, it still exists.\n\nIf I go D to (5,1) on turn 21, I eat it.\n\nBut is it safe? Tail reward danger?\n\nTail is at (1,6), head at (5,2), not adjacent, so no problem.\n\nEat the food, snake grows.\n\nSo in this sequence, I eat both foods.\n\nNow, if I had delayed eating the first food, I might still eat it at turn 19, but then for the second food, I need to go down from there.\n\nFor example, if at turn 17 I go D to (4,4), then turn 18 go R to (5,4), turn 19 go U to (5,5) eat.\n\nThen at turn 19, head at (5,5), similar to after turn 17 in previous, but now at turn 19.\n\nThen I can go down similarly, but the food at (5,1) might be eaten later, but still possible.\n\nIn terms of turns, eating at turn 19 for first food, then to (5,4) on turn 20, (5,3) on 21, (5,2) on 22, (5,1) on 23, all within life span.\n\nBut in the first sequence, I eat first food earlier and second on turn 21.\n\nBut since no negative food, score same.\n\nBut for survival, in the first sequence, by eating early, snake is longer, but in this small grid, with 9 segments, it might be tight, but as long as I don't trap myself.\n\nIn the sequence above, after eating at (5,1), the snake is long, but I can move around.\n\nBut let's see the positions when I go to (5,1).\n\nIn the first sequence: after turn 21 eat at (5,1), positions: head at (5,1), then (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), and new segment, so tail at (1,6) or something.\n\nBut (1,6) is occupied, but tail will move later.\n\nBut the point is, the snake is along the bottom, which might be ok.\n\nTo be thorough, I should consider if there are risks in the first sequence.\n\nAt turn 18, when I go D to (5,4), is there any issue?\n\n(5,4) is empty, fine.\n\nSimilarly, all moves seem safe.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions for several turns.\n\nSince I planned up to turn 21, I can output turns 17 to 21.\n\nBut the food at (5,1) is eaten on turn 21, which is within the plan.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 17: R (to eat (5,5))\n\nTurn 18: D (to (5,4))\n\nTurn 19: D (to (5,3))\n\nTurn 20: D (to (5,2))\n\nTurn 21: D (to eat (5,1))\n\nBut on turn 21, when I go to (5,1), I eat it.\n\nNow, after that, I need to think further, but for the answer, I can provide these.\n\nBut let's confirm the directions.\n\nAt turn 17, head at (4,5) dir R, move R to (5,5).\n\nThen turn 18, at (5,5), move D to (5,4).\n\nThen turn 19, at (5,4), dir down, move D to (5,3).\n\nTurn 20, at (5,3), dir down, move D to (5,2).\n\nTurn 21, at (5,2), dir down, move D to (5,1).\n\nAll moves are valid, no reverse, no collision.\n\nAnd I eat both foods.\n\nIf I had gone a different way, it might not be as efficient.\n\nFor example, if I went R on turn 18 to (6,5), then I might be stuck in the corner.\n\nAt (6,5), I can only go U or D, but U to (6,6) or D to (6,4), then I have to come back, but snake body might block.\n\nBut in this case, going down is better to reach the other food.\n\nSo the sequence seems good.\n\nTherefore, for the answer:\n\nTurn 17: R\n\nTurn 18: D\n\nTurn 19: D\n\nTurn 20: D\n\nTurn 21: D\n\nBut I need to output in the boxed format.\n\nThe current turn is t1=17, so actions for turn 17,18,19,20,21.\n\nI think 5 turns are enough for now.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, the AI must prioritize eating the positive food at (5,5) due to its short life span (3 turns remaining at turn 17, disappearing after turn 19). Moving right (R) on turn 17 eats this food immediately, securing the +1 reward and increasing the snake's length. Avoiding the up (U) move is critical, as it leads to a dead end on turn 18 with no safe moves. The down (D) move is possible but risks missing the (5,5) food if not followed by specific moves, and it delays growth unnecessarily.\n\nAfter eating at (5,5), the snake head is at (5,5) with direction right. On turn 18, moving down (D) to (5,4) avoids the obstacle at (5,6) and the reverse move (left, L), both invalid. This positions the snake to head toward the second food at (5,1) efficiently. Continuing down for turns 19, 20, and 21 allows the snake to reach (5,1) safely by turn 21, eating it for another +1 reward before it expires (life span 9 at turn 17, still available at turn 21).\n\nThis sequence (R, D, D, D, D) ensures both foods are eaten within 5 turns, maximizing the score with minimal risk. The snake grows predictably, and the path avoids collisions, walls, and dead ends. The grid has sufficient space (35 playable cells minus obstacles), and the downward movement frees up space as the tail moves.\n\n**Planned Moves (5 turns ahead):**\n- **Turn 17**: Move right (R) to (5,5), eating the positive food (+1, length +1).\n- **Turn 18**: Move down (D) to (5,4), avoiding the obstacle and reverse move.\n- **Turn 19**: Move down (D) to (5,3), continuing toward (5,1).\n- **Turn 20**: Move down (D) to (5,2), nearing the second food.\n- **Turn 21**: Move down (D) to (5,1), eating the positive food (+1, length +1).\n\n**Risk Analysis:**\n- **Turn 17 R move**: Eats (5,5) safely; no tail reward danger (tail at (1,3) is distant), and no collisions.\n- **Turn 18 D move**: From (5,5), D is valid (U is obstacle, L is reverse, R is possible but less optimal for reaching (5,1)); (5,4) is empty.\n- **Turns 19-21 D moves**: Each move is valid (no reverse, as direction is down); all target cells are empty. Eating (5,1) on turn 21 is safe (tail at (1,6) is not adjacent, so no collision).\n- **Long-term survival**: The sequence avoids walls, obstacles, and body collisions. After turn 21, the snake can explore open areas (e.g., left or right from (5,1)) to avoid trapping itself.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 17: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 18: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 19: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 20: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 21: D (down)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. It's turn 18, and I have to plan my moves for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nThe grid has walls. Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), meaning it's an 8x8 grid since x and y go from 0 to 7 inclusive. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (5,5), and the body segments follow: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3). So the snake is 9 segments long. Head direction is R, which is right, so it's moving east.\n\nFood: there's one food at (5,1) with value 1 and life span 8. Since it's turn 18, and life span decreases every turn, including current, so by turn 18, if it was spawned earlier, life span might be less, but here it says life span 8 at turn 18, so it has 8 turns left including turn 18. Let me read carefully.\n\nThe food is given as (x, y, life_span, value), so (5,1,8,1) means position (5,1), life span 8, value 1. Value 1 is positive food since it's +1. And life span 8 means it will disappear after 8 turns from now, so it will be gone after turn 25 (18 + 8 - 1? Let's calculate the disappearance turn.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including the current turn. So at turn 18, life span is 8. After turn 18, it becomes 7, then 6, and so on. After turn 25, it would be 0, so it disappears after turn 25? But \"disappears after N turns\" means it lasts for N turns including the current one? I need to clarify.\n\nThe rule says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span)\" and \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nSo, at the start of turn t, if food has life span L, it decreases to L-1 at the end of the turn. If L-1 becomes 0, it disappears before the next turn.\n\nStandard interpretation: when we say \"life span N\", it means it will disappear after N more turns. So with life span 8 at turn 18, it will be present on turns 18,19,20,21,22,23,24, and disappear after turn 24, so not on turn 25. Let's think:\n\n- At turn 18, life span 8: after turn 18, it decreases to 7.\n\n- After turn 19, to 6.\n\n- ...\n\n- After turn 24, to 0, and it disappears, so not available on turn 25.\n\nSo it can be eaten from turn 18 to turn 24 inclusive.\n\nNow, the food is at (5,1). Snake head is at (5,5), moving right (R). The grid is 8x8, walls at borders and internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nI need to plan moves for multiple turns ahead. Since the answer format says to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., I should plan at least 5 turns: turns 18,19,20,21,22.\n\nBut I need to think about getting to the food safely.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid coordinates: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders, so cells where x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls, cannot move there. Also internal obstacle at (5,6), so that cell is blocked.\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- Head: (5,5)\n\n- Body: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)\n\nSo let's list all snake segments:\n\n1. Head: (5,5)\n\n2. (4,5)\n\n3. (3,5)\n\n4. (2,5)\n\n5. (2,6)\n\n6. (1,6)\n\n7. (1,5)\n\n8. (1,4)\n\n9. (1,3)  // tail\n\nThe snake is moving right, so from (5,5), moving right would go to (6,5), but let's see what's around.\n\nCurrent direction is R, so possible moves: since no instant reverse, I cannot move left (L), because that would be opposite to current right. So possible moves are U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), or R (right, x+1). But I have to avoid walls and body collisions.\n\nFirst, check adjacent cells from head (5,5):\n\n- Right: (6,5) — x=6, y=5. x=6 is not wall yet, x=7 is wall, so (6,5) is free? But let's see if it's occupied.\n\n(6,5): is it a wall? Walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and internal (5,6). (6,5) is not a wall. Is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3). None at (6,5), so it should be free.\n\nBut (6,5) is x=6, y=5, which is within bounds, not a border wall since borders are x=0,x=7 etc., so x=6 is fine, y=5 fine.\n\n- Up: (5,6) — but (5,6) is the internal obstacle! The internal obstacle is at (5,6), so it's a wall, cannot move there.\n\n- Down: (5,4) — y=4, not wall. Is it occupied? Snake: no one at (5,4), so free.\n\n- Left: (4,5) — but (4,5) is the first body segment. Now, moving to a body segment: generally, if it's not the tail, it's collision. But here, (4,5) is not the tail; the tail is at (1,3). Also, rule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, moving to (4,5) would be collision because it's a body segment, not the tail.\n\nThe tail is at (1,3), which is far away.\n\nSo from (5,5), possible moves:\n\n- R: to (6,5) — seems free\n\n- U: to (5,6) — but (5,6) is wall (internal obstacle), so invalid\n\n- D: to (5,4) — free\n\n- L: to (4,5) — body segment, collision, invalid\n\nAlso, cannot move L because it's opposite to current direction R? No, the no instant reverse is for the next move, but since I'm deciding the action, I can choose to move U, D, or R, but not L because it's opposite and might not be allowed, but the rule is about not moving opposite on the next turn, meaning if current direction is R, I cannot choose L for this turn's action.\n\nRule: \"Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\" — \"on next turn\" might be misphrased. Let me read.\n\n\"**No instant reverse**: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nI think it means that when you choose the action for the current turn, you cannot choose the opposite direction to the current moving direction.\n\nFor example, if current direction is R, you cannot choose L for this turn.\n\nSimilarly, here, current direction is R, so I cannot choose L.\n\nSo possible actions: U, D, or R.\n\nBut U to (5,6) is wall, so invalid.\n\nD to (5,4) is free.\n\nR to (6,5) is free.\n\nSo only two choices: D (down to (5,4)) or R (right to (6,5)).\n\nNow, I need to think long-term towards the food at (5,1).\n\nFood is at (5,1), head at (5,5), so same x, different y. Head y=5, food y=1, so I need to go down.\n\nBut there might be obstacles.\n\nFirst, let's list all occupied cells for clarity.\n\nSnake:\n\n- (5,5) head\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (3,5)\n\n- (2,5)\n\n- (2,6)\n\n- (1,6)\n\n- (1,5)\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (1,3) tail\n\nAlso, walls: borders and (5,6)\n\nFree cells: for example, (5,4) is free, (6,5) free, etc.\n\nFood at (5,1), which is free? Not occupied by snake, I assume.\n\n(5,1) is not in snake positions, and not wall, so yes.\n\nTo reach (5,1) from (5,5), I need to go down, but I have to avoid the body and walls.\n\nCurrently, if I go down to (5,4), that gets me closer to (5,1).\n\nIf I go right to (6,5), that might take me away, but I could go down later.\n\nBut let's think about the path.\n\nAlso, the snake body might move, so I need to simulate moves.\n\nMoreover, I need to consider if eating the food is safe. Food at (5,1) is positive, value 1, so eating it increases length by 1.\n\nBut there's a rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut here, the food is at (5,1), which is not the tail; tail is at (1,3). So when I eat it, the tail grows, but since I'm eating at (5,1), the new tail will be added after moving, so the tail will be where it was, but when you eat, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn? I need to recall how snake movement works.\n\nStandard Snake: when you move, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the next position. If you eat food, the tail doesn't move, so snake grows by one.\n\nRule: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food.\n\nSo, when snake eats food, after moving, the tail stays, so length increases.\n\nSpecifically: in a turn, you move the head to a new cell. If that cell has food, you eat it, and the body extends, so the tail doesn't move that turn. If no food, tail moves forward, so last segment is removed.\n\nIn this case, if I move to a cell with food, I eat it, and the snake grows; the segment that was tail remains, and a new head is added.\n\nSo, positions update: new head at food cell, body follows, and since ate, tail doesn't shorten.\n\nIf no eat, new head, body shifts, tail removed.\n\nNow, for Tail Reward Danger: if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n\nBut in this case, the food is at (5,1), not at tail.\n\nTail is at (1,3), far away.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut I need to get to (5,1) safely.\n\nFirst, let's plan a path.\n\nFrom (5,5), if I go down to (5,4), that's good.\n\nThen from (5,4), I can go down to (5,3), then (5,2), then (5,1).\n\nBut is (5,4) to (5,3) to (5,2) to (5,1) all free?\n\nCurrent state: (5,4) is free, as we saw.\n\n(5,3): is it free? Snake positions: we have (1,4) and (1,3), but (5,3) is not occupied. Walls: no, so free.\n\n(5,2): similarly, free.\n\n(5,1): food, free except for food.\n\nBut after I move, the body will also move, so I need to simulate the snake movement over turns.\n\nLet me plan multiple turns.\n\nAssume I go down now to (5,4).\n\nTurn 18: action D, move to (5,4)\n\nNow, after move: since I didn't eat food (no food at (5,4)? (5,4) is free, no food, so no eat. Snake moves: head to (5,4), body segments shift: the old head (5,5) becomes body, so positions: new head (5,4), then (5,5) [was head], then (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), and tail (1,3) is removed? Since no eat, tail moves.\n\nList:\n\nBefore move: positions: [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)]\n\nAfter move D to (5,4):\n\n- Head moves to (5,4)\n\n- Body: each segment moves to the next position in the list.\n\nSo:\n\n- Segment 1: was (5,5) now becomes body at position 2? Better to think of the new list.\n\nNew head: (5,4)\n\nThen the old positions except tail: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)\n\nThe tail (1,3) is removed.\n\nSo new positions: [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)]\n\nLength is still 9, since no eat.\n\nNow, head direction: I moved down, so new direction is D.\n\nTurn 19: from (5,4), I can go down to (5,3), or other directions.\n\nPossible moves: current direction D, so cannot move U (up, opposite). Can move L, R, or D.\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\n- D: (5,3) — free? Not wall, not occupied? In new positions, (5,3) not listed, so free.\n\n- L: (4,4) — free? Check: not wall, not in positions, so free.\n\n- R: (6,4) — free? x=6,y=4, not wall, not occupied.\n\nAlso U: (5,5) but (5,5) is now a body segment (second position), so moving there would be collision. Also, U is opposite to current D? Current direction is D, so moving U is opposite, invalid anyway.\n\nSo possible: D, L, or R.\n\nI want to go to (5,3) to reach food.\n\nSo go D to (5,3).\n\nTurn 19: action D to (5,3)\n\nNow, (5,3) has no food? Food is at (5,1), so no.\n\nSnake moves: head to (5,3), body shifts: new positions [(5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)] and tail (1,4) removed.\n\nOld tail was (1,4), removed.\n\nNew positions: head (5,3), then (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 20: from (5,3), go D to (5,2)\n\n(5,2) free? Yes.\n\nAction D to (5,2)\n\nNo food.\n\nSnake moves: head to (5,2), body: [(5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)] and (1,5) removed? Old positions had (1,5) as last, removed.\n\nNew positions: [(5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)]\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 21: from (5,2), go D to (5,1)\n\nNow, (5,1) has food! So I eat it.\n\nAction D to (5,1)\n\nEat food, so snake grows: head moves to (5,1), and tail does not move, so the body segments all shift, but tail remains.\n\nOld positions: [(5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)]\n\nAfter move: head to (5,1), then the old body: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), and since ate, tail (1,6) remains, no removal. So new positions: [(5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)] length 10 now.\n\nDirection D.\n\nI ate the food at turn 21, which is within life span (turns 18 to 24), so good.\n\nBut is this path safe? In the moves above, I assumed all cells are free, which they are, no body or walls.\n\nBut after eating, the snake is longer, and I need to survive.\n\nAlso, in this path, I went straight down from (5,5) to (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1) over 4 moves: turn 18 D, 19 D, 20 D, 21 D.\n\nTurn 18: to (5,4), turn 19 to (5,3), turn 20 to (5,2), turn 21 to (5,1).\n\nBut at turn 18, head is at (5,5), move D to (5,4) on turn 18.\n\nThen at turn 19, from (5,4) to (5,3)\n\nTurn 20: (5,3) to (5,2)\n\nTurn 21: (5,2) to (5,1)\n\nYes.\n\nNow, after that, at turn 21, head at (5,1), direction D.\n\nNow, what can I do? I need to avoid walls and body.\n\nAdjacent cells from (5,1):\n\n- D: (5,0) but y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n\n- U: (5,2) — but (5,2) is now a body segment (second position), so collision if I move there.\n\n- L: (4,1) — free? Not wall, not occupied? Positions: new are (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6). So (4,1) not listed, so free.\n\n- R: (6,1) — free? x=6,y=1, not wall, not occupied.\n\nCurrent direction is D, but I cannot move D to wall.\n\nPossible moves: cannot move U (opposite? Current D, U is opposite, invalid? Or can I? Rule: no instant reverse, so if current direction D, cannot move U.\n\nAlso, moving U to (5,2) is body, collision anyway.\n\nSo possible: L or R.\n\nL to (4,1) or R to (6,1).\n\nSay I go L to (4,1).\n\nBut I need to think beyond just getting the food; after eating, I have to survive.\n\nIn this path, I ate the food quickly, but let's see if there are risks.\n\nAnother thing: in the initial position, when I move down to (5,4) on turn 18, is there any issue?\n\nAt turn 18, before move, snake has segments at (1,4) and (1,3), etc.\n\nWhen I move to (5,4), it should be fine.\n\nBut let's confirm the grid.\n\nI could have gone right to (6,5) at turn 18.\n\nThen from there, I might need to go down later, but it might take longer.\n\nFor example, turn 18 R to (6,5)\n\nThen direction R.\n\nThen turn 19, from (6,5), I could go D to (6,4), then to (6,3), etc., but food is at (5,1), so I need to go left and down, which might be less direct.\n\nAnd the food life span is 8 turns, plenty of time, but I should get it sooner to avoid missing it or other risks.\n\nIn the direct path, I eat at turn 21.\n\nBut after eating at (5,1), I'm at the bottom, with body above me.\n\nIn the positions after eating: head (5,1), then (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)\n\nSo from (5,1), if I go left to (4,1), that might be ok.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut I need to think about survival.\n\nAnother risk: the internal obstacle at (5,6) is above, but not directly in the way.\n\nPerhaps the direct path is fine.\n\nBut let's see if moving down immediately causes any trap.\n\nFor example, at turn 18, if I go down to (5,4), the body is moving, and the tail is at (1,3), which will move to (1,4) or something, but not near.\n\nIn the simulation above, after turn 18 move, positions include (1,4) and (1,5), etc., all fine.\n\nThen after turn 19, (1,5) and (1,6), and so on.\n\nNo issue.\n\nBut what about the food under body? Rule says food can spawn under body, but here food is at (5,1), not under snake.\n\nSnake is at (5,5) to (1,3), so (5,1) is free.\n\nAnother thing: Tail Reward Danger doesn't apply.\n\nSo eating at (5,1) is safe.\n\nIn this path, I used 4 moves to eat: from turn 18 to 21.\n\nBut at turn 18, I need to output actions starting from turn 18.\n\nThe answer should be for turns 18,19,20,21,... but since I ate at 21, I might stop or continue, but I need to output multiple actions.\n\nThe format says to list actions for several turns, e.g., 5 turns.\n\nTurn t1=18, so list actions for turn 18,19,20,21,22.\n\nIn my plan, turn 18: D, 19: D, 20: D, 21: D (to eat), then turn 22 I need to decide.\n\nAfter turn 21, head at (5,1), direction D, but I cannot move down to wall.\n\nSo on turn 22, I need to move left or right.\n\nSay, I can move L to (4,1) or R to (6,1).\n\nNow, to avoid risk, I should choose a direction where I can continue safely.\n\nFor example, if I go left to (4,1), then from there I can go up or down or left.\n\n(4,1) y=1, down to (4,0) is wall, invalid; up to (4,2), etc.\n\nSimilarly, right to (6,1), then down to wall invalid, up to (6,2), etc.\n\nBut since the body is above, going up might be towards body.\n\nAfter turn 21 positions: head (5,1), body: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)\n\nSo the area around (5,1): (4,1) free, (6,1) free, (5,0) wall, (5,2) body.\n\nSo from (5,1), moving left to (4,1) is free, moving right to (6,1) is free.\n\nSay I move left to (4,1) on turn 22.\n\nThen direction L (since I moved left).\n\nThen on turn 23, from (4,1), I can move left to (3,1), or up to (4,2), or down invalid.\n\nCurrent direction L, so cannot move right.\n\nPossible: L to (3,1), U to (4,2), D invalid.\n\n(3,1) might be free, (4,2) free, etc.\n\nI can continue moving left or up to avoid the body.\n\nSimilarly, if I had gone right to (6,1), similar situation.\n\nBut since I want to maximize score, I should look for more food, but currently only one food, so after eating, I need to survive and wait for more food, but the state doesn't show other food, only one given.\n\nIn the input, only one food listed: (5,1,8,1)\n\nBut new food might spawn later, but for now, I should focus on surviving.\n\nIn the direct path, going straight down seems fine.\n\nBut is there a reason not to go down immediately? For example, at turn 18, if I go down to (5,4), is that cell safe? Yes.\n\nAnother option: at turn 18, I could go right to (6,5), then down later.\n\nBut that might take more turns to reach food.\n\nFor example, turn 18 R to (6,5), direction R.\n\nThen turn 19, from (6,5), I could go D to (6,4), then turn 20 to (6,3), turn 21 to (6,2), turn 22 to (6,1), then turn 23 to (5,1)? But (5,1) is at x=5,y=1, from (6,1) I need to go left to (5,1).\n\nBut at turn 23, food life span: at turn 18, life span 8, so after turn 18, 7 left; turn 19,6; turn 20,5; turn 21,4; turn 22,3; turn 23,2; so still available.\n\nBut it takes more turns, and I might risk not getting it if something happens.\n\nDirect path eats at turn 21, this path at turn 23 or later.\n\nTurn 18: to (6,5)\n\nTurn 19: to (6,4) say\n\nTurn 20: to (6,3)\n\nTurn 21: to (6,2)\n\nTurn 22: to (6,1)\n\nTurn 23: to (5,1) by moving left.\n\nBut when I move to (5,1) from (6,1), I need to go left, so direction L.\n\nBut in terms of turns, I eat later.\n\nAnd more turns, more risk.\n\nAlso, in the direct path, I have time to move away after eating.\n\nSo direct path seems better.\n\nBut in the direct path, when I go straight down, at turn 18 to (5,4), then the body is behind me.\n\nOne thing: in the initial position, the snake has a segment at (1,5) and (1,4), etc., but when I move down, it should be fine.\n\nPerhaps I should check if (5,4) is under the body or something, but no, it's free.\n\nAnother rule: food under body can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves on.\n\nBut here, no food under body.\n\nSo I think direct down is good.\n\nBut let's think about the head direction.\n\nAt turn 18, current direction R, I move D, which is perpendicular, so new direction D.\n\nThen I move D multiple times.\n\nNow, for turn 22, after eating at (5,1), I need to move.\n\nIn the answer, I need to list actions for turn 18 to say 22 or more.\n\nSince the food is the only one, and I eat at turn 21, turn 22 I need to survive.\n\nSo for turn 22, from (5,1), I can go L or R.\n\nSay, I go L to (4,1) for example.\n\nThen turn 23, from (4,1), go U to (4,2) or L to (3,1), etc.\n\nBut I don't need to specify beyond, but for the answer, list 5 actions: turn 18,19,20,21,22.\n\nTurn 18: D\n\nTurn 19: D\n\nTurn 20: D\n\nTurn 21: D (to eat)\n\nTurn 22: need to choose, say L to (4,1)\n\nIs there a better move?\n\nPerhaps at turn 18, if I go down, but maybe I can go down and then not go straight if there is risk, but here no.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (5,6) is above, but since I'm going down, it doesn't affect.\n\nBut let's see the body positions.\n\nAfter moving down multiple times, the body might create a barrier, but in this case, when I go straight down, the body is following vertically, so from (5,5) to (5,2) or something, but after I move, the body shifts.\n\nFor example, after turn 21, positions are vertical from (5,1) to (5,5), then to (4,5), etc.\n\nSo the column x=5 from y=1 to y=5 is occupied, but below y=1 is wall.\n\nSo from (5,1), I must move left or right to avoid being trapped.\n\nMoving left to (4,1) is fine.\n\nThen I can go to (4,2), (4,3), etc., or left.\n\nSimilarly, moving right to (6,1), then to (6,2), etc.\n\nNo immediate danger.\n\nTo be safe, I should move away from the body.\n\nFor turn 22, moving left or right is similar; I can choose left.\n\nBut let's confirm if going straight down is possible without issues.\n\nAt turn 18, when I move to (5,4), is there any food or something? No.\n\nAnother point: the life span of food is 8, so I have time, but going directly is efficient.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if the cell (5,4) is safe for future, but it seems fine.\n\nMaybe at turn 18, I can go right to (6,5) to avoid something, but what?\n\nFor example, if I go to (6,5), then I can go down to (6,4), etc., but then to reach (5,1), I need to go left at some point, which might be towards the body.\n\nFor instance, if I go to (6,1) at turn 22, then to (5,1) at turn 23, but when I move to (5,1), the body might be near.\n\nAt turn 22, if head at (6,1), body: after previous moves.\n\nAssume I went right then down.\n\nTurn 18: R to (6,5), direction R\n\nNew positions: head (6,5), then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)  // (1,3) removed\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 19: go D to (6,4), direction D\n\nPositions: head (6,4), then (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)  // (1,4) removed? After turn 18, positions: [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)] after move to (6,5), tail (1,3) removed, so positions include (1,4).\n\nAfter turn 19 move D to (6,4): head (6,4), then old body: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), and tail (1,4) removed. So new: [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)]\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 20: go D to (6,3), positions: head (6,3), then (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)  // (1,5) removed\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 21: go D to (6,2), positions: head (6,2), then (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)  // (1,6) removed? Old positions had (1,6) as last, removed.\n\nAfter turn 20: positions [(6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)]\n\nAfter turn 21 move D to (6,2): head (6,2), then body (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) and (1,6) removed. So new: [(6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)]\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 22: go D to (6,1), positions: head (6,1), then (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)  // (2,6) removed? After move, head to (6,1), body: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), and (2,6) removed. So new: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nDirection D.\n\nNow, food at (5,1), I need to move left to (5,1) on next turn.\n\nTurn 23: from (6,1), move L to (5,1)\n\nNow, (5,1) has food, so eat.\n\nBut when I move to (5,1), is it safe? (5,1) is free, but let's see the direction.\n\nCurrent direction D, but I move left, which is perpendicular, so ok.\n\nMove to (5,1), eat food.\n\nPositions before move: head (6,1), body (6,2), etc.\n\nAfter move: head to (5,1), then body: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), and since eat, tail (2,5) remains? Old tail was (2,5), which is now the last segment.\n\nAfter move to (5,1), new head (5,1), then the old head position (6,1) becomes body, so positions: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)] since ate, no removal.\n\nLength 10.\n\nNow, head at (5,1), direction L (since moved left).\n\nBut now, from (5,1), adjacent cells: U (5,2) — not occupied? Positions: (5,1) head, (6,1) body, (6,2), etc., (5,2) not in list, so free? (5,2) is not occupied, yes.\n\nD (5,0) wall.\n\nL (4,1) free.\n\nR (6,1) but (6,1) is now body segment, collision.\n\nU (5,2) free, D invalid.\n\nCurrent direction L, so moving R is opposite, invalid.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (5,2) or L to (4,1).\n\nSay go U to (5,2).\n\nBut (5,2) is free.\n\nCompared to direct path, I ate later at turn 23 instead of 21.\n\nAnd I used more moves.\n\nAlso, in direct path, after eating at turn 21, I was at (5,1) with body above, and I moved left on turn 22.\n\nIn this path, similar.\n\nBut direct is faster to get the food.\n\nMoreover, in direct path, when I go straight down, the body is trailing vertically, so when I move left or right from bottom, I have space.\n\nIn the alternative, I have a horizontal segment.\n\nBut both seem survivable.\n\nBut since the goal is to maximize score, getting food sooner is better, as I might get more food later.\n\nAlso, with longer life span, less risk of losing it.\n\nLife span 8 turns, so from turn 18, I have until turn 24 to eat, so eating at 21 is fine, at 23 also fine.\n\nBut direct path is simpler and safer in terms of path.\n\nAnother thing: in the initial position, at turn 18, if I go down to (5,4), I am moving towards the food, but is there a risk of colliding with the body that is moving?\n\nFor example, at turn 18, body has (1,4) and (1,3), but (5,4) is far.\n\nAfter move, positions are fine.\n\nPerhaps I should simulate the grid.\n\nLet me sketch grid at turn 18.\n\nGrid 8x8, x 0-7, y 0-7.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 borders, and internal (5,6).\n\nSnake: head (5,5), body: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3)\n\nSo the snake is mostly on the left, with a tail at (1,3).\n\nFood at (5,1).\n\nFree space: for example, (5,4) free, (6,5) free, etc.\n\nIf I move down to (5,4) at turn 18, new head (5,4), body: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) // tail (1,3) gone\n\nNow at (5,4), I can go down to (5,3), free.\n\nThen to (5,2), free.\n\nThen to (5,1), eat.\n\nAfter that, head at (5,1), body above: (5,2) to (5,5), then to (4,5), etc.\n\nFrom (5,1), move left to (4,1) or right to (6,1).\n\nSay move left to (4,1) on turn 22.\n\nThen from (4,1), I can go up to (4,2), left to (3,1), etc.\n\nNo problem.\n\nIf I had gone right at turn 18, I might have more space on the right, but it takes longer to get food.\n\nI think direct down is better.\n\nBut let's see the head direction constraint.\n\nAt turn 18, current direction R, I move D, which is allowed.\n\nThen direction becomes D.\n\nMove D again, allowed.\n\nNo issue.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if there is negative food, but only one food, positive.\n\nSo I think for turns 18 to 21, move down four times.\n\nThen for turn 22, I need to move, say left.\n\nBut in the answer, I should specify the actions.\n\nThe answer format is to list for several turns, e.g., 5 turns.\n\nSo for turn 18: D, 19: D, 20: D, 21: D, 22: L (for example)\n\nBut I need to choose L or R for turn 22.\n\nSince the body is to the right and above, moving left might be safer to go to the left side.\n\n(4,1) is free, and I can go to (3,1), etc.\n\nMoving right to (6,1), then I can go up to (6,2), but (6,2) might be free.\n\nIn terms of space, both similar.\n\nBut left side has the body segment at (2,5), (3,5), etc., but after moves, it might move.\n\nFor example, after turn 21 in direct path, positions: [(5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)]\n\nSo at (5,1), moving left to (4,1) is away from body.\n\nMoving right to (6,1) is also away.\n\n(6,1) might be closer to the right wall, but not immediately dangerous.\n\nI think either is fine, but let's say move left for now.\n\nTo be precise, I should list the actions.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (5,6) doesn't affect.\n\nI think the plan is good.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 18: D\n\nTurn 19: D\n\nTurn 20: D\n\nTurn 21: D\n\nTurn 22: L  // to (4,1)\n\nBut in turn 22, when I move, no food, so snake moves normally.\n\nAfter turn 22 move L to (4,1): head to (4,1), body shifts: new head (4,1), then (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) // (1,6) removed? Since no eat.\n\nAfter turn 21 positions: [(5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)] length 10.\n\nAfter move to (4,1) on turn 22: head (4,1), then old body: (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), and since no eat, tail (1,6) removed. So new positions: [(4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)] but (2,6) is included, and tail is (2,6).\n\nLength 10, no change.\n\nDirection L.\n\nThen I can continue, but for answer, up to turn 22 is fine.\n\nSince the food is eaten at turn 21, and I have actions planned.\n\nPerhaps I should output 5 actions.\n\nBut in the thinking, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, but for output, I can list multiple turns.\n\nNow, for the boxed answer.\n\nBut let's confirm if going straight down is risky.\n\nOne point: at turn 18, if I go down to (5,4), the cell (5,4) was not occupied, but after I move, it becomes body, but that's fine.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (5,1) has life span 8, so even if I delay, I can get it, but direct is better.\n\nPerhaps I can consider going around to avoid potential traps, but here no trap.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 18: D\n\nTurn 19: D\n\nTurn 20: D\n\nTurn 21: D\n\nTurn 22: L\n\nBut for turn 22, I need to specify the action.\n\nSince I moved down multiple times, after turn 21, head direction is D, so on turn 22, I cannot move U, but moving L is fine.\n\nSimilarly, in the move to (4,1), it's valid.\n\nTo make it clear.\n\nI think this is the plan.\n</think>\n### Analysis for Turn 18 Decision\n\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I will plan 5 turns ahead (turns 18 to 22) with the goal of eating the positive food at (5,1) safely. The food has a life span of 8 turns (from turn 18 to turn 24 inclusive), so there is time, but a direct path minimizes risk and maximizes efficiency. The snake head is at (5,5) with direction R (right), and the grid has walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and an internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\n#### Key Considerations:\n- **Immediate Moves (Turn 18)**: From (5,5), current direction is R, so reverse move (L) is invalid. Possible moves are U, D, or R.\n  - U (to (5,6)): Blocked by internal obstacle (wall), invalid.\n  - R (to (6,5)): Free cell, but moves away from food at (5,1), increasing path length and risk.\n  - D (to (5,4)): Free cell, moves directly toward food, reducing turns to reach it.\n- **Path to Food**: The food is at (5,1), directly below the head. Moving down repeatedly (D) for 4 turns (turns 18–21) allows eating at turn 21. This path is safe:\n  - Cells (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), and (5,1) are free of walls, obstacles, and snake body in all turns.\n  - After eating, the snake grows to length 10, and no \"Tail Reward Danger\" applies (food not near tail).\n- **Post-Food Survival (Turn 22)**: After eating at (5,1) on turn 21, head direction is D (down). From (5,1):\n  - D (to (5,0)): Wall (y=0), invalid.\n  - U (to (5,2)): Body segment (after growth), collision risk and invalid due to opposite direction.\n  - L (to (4,1)) or R (to (6,1)): Both free; L is chosen to move away from the dense body area (vertical column at x=5) and toward open space on the left, reducing collision risk long-term.\n- **5-Turn Lookahead**: \n  - **Turn 18 (D)**: Move to (5,4). Safe, no food eaten.\n  - **Turn 19 (D)**: Move to (5,3). Safe, no food.\n  - **Turn 20 (D)**: Move to (5,2). Safe, no food.\n  - **Turn 21 (D)**: Move to (5,1), eat food (+1 score, length increases to 10).\n  - **Turn 22 (L)**: Move to (4,1). Safe, no food, and positions snake for future movement (e.g., to (4,2) or (3,1) on later turns).\n- **Risk Assessment**: \n  - Direct down path avoids body collisions and walls. Alternative paths (e.g., moving right first) delay eating, increasing risk of missing food or encountering new hazards.\n  - Life span allows until turn 24, but early eating secures the reward and frees the snake to explore.\n  - Post-food, moving left (L) on turn 22 avoids the wall and body, ensuring survival.\n\n#### Action Plan:\n- Turn 18: D (down) to (5,4) – Direct path to food, safe.\n- Turn 19: D (down) to (5,3) – Continue down, safe.\n- Turn 20: D (down) to (5,2) – Approach food, safe.\n- Turn 21: D (down) to (5,1) – Eat food, score +1.\n- Turn 22: L (left) to (4,1) – Survive and reposition.\n\nThis plan eats the food quickly (turn 21) and ensures the snake can safely navigate afterward. If new food appears, it can be targeted in subsequent turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 18: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 19: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 20: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 21: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 22: L (left)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 19, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,6). So, the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, except for (5,6) which is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: The head is at (5,4), and the body segments follow: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4). So, the snake is 9 segments long. Head direction is down, meaning it was moving downward to reach (5,4) from (5,5)? Let me list the positions in order:\n\n- Head: (5,4)\n\n- Then: (5,5)  // this is behind the head, so when moving down, from (5,5) to (5,4) is down? No.\n\nIf the head is at (5,4) and it was moving down, that means it came from above, so previous head position was (5,5), and it moved down to (5,4). But in the list, (5,5) is the first body segment after head. Positions: [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5), ...]. So head is at (5,4), and next is (5,5), which is directly below it? y=5 is below y=4 if y increases down? I think I need to clarify the coordinate system.\n\nTypically in grids, (0,0) is top-left, y increases downward, x increases right. But let's confirm from the walls: walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is top, y=7 is bottom. Similarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nSo, moving up decreases y, moving down increases y.\n\nHead at (5,4), direction down, so it was moving to (5,4) from, say, previous position. Since direction is down, and head is at (5,4), that means it entered this cell from above, so from (5,5)? But (5,5) is listed as the first body segment.\n\nThe positions are given as a list: index 0 is head, index 1 is the segment that was head before, and so on, with tail at the end.\n\nSo at turn 19, head is at (5,4), and it moved there from (5,5) by going down? From (5,5) to (5,4) is up, since y decreases.\n\nDirection: head direction is given as \"D\" for down. But if head is at (5,4) and direction is down, that means the snake is facing downward, so it was moving downward to reach (5,4). But from where? Previous head position must be above, so (5,5) or something. Let's see the positions: head (5,4), then (5,5), which is below (5,4) since y=5 > y=4? y=4 to y=5 is down, so if head is at (5,4), and next segment is (5,5), that means the head is above the neck, so it must have come from below? I'm confused.\n\nStandard snake movement: when moving, the head goes to a new cell, and the tail follows, so the body segments are where the head was previously.\n\nAt turn t, snake positions: head at current position, then the previous positions in order.\n\nSo at turn 19, head is at (5,4). That means at turn 18, head was at some position, and it moved to (5,4).\n\nDirection is given as \"D\" for down, meaning the current movement direction is down. So at turn 18, head was at (5,5), and it moved down to (5,4)? From (5,5) to (5,4): y decreases, which is up, not down.\n\nI think I have a coordinate inconsistency.\n\nWalls: y=0 and y=7, with y=0 top, y=7 bottom.\n\nSo moving up: y decreases, moving down: y increases.\n\nTherefore, from (5,5) to (5,4) is moving up (y from 5 to 4).\n\nBut direction is given as \"D\" down, which should be increasing y.\n\nHead at (5,4), direction down. So if it's facing down, it can move to (5,5) next.\n\nBut in the positions, after head (5,4), the next segment is (5,5), which is directly below it at y=5.\n\nSo the head is at (5,4), neck at (5,5), meaning the snake came from (5,5) to (5,4) by moving up, but direction is said to be down? That can't be right.\n\nPerhaps the direction is the direction it will move next, or the last direction moved.\n\nLet's read the input: \"Snake Head Direction: D\" – it doesn't specify if it's the current facing or last move.\n\nBut in context, it should be the last move direction or current facing. I think it's the direction the head is facing, so for next move, it can go in that direction or perpendicular, but not opposite.\n\nThe rule says: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nSo current direction is given, so for turn 19, current direction is D (down), meaning the head is facing down, so it can move down, left, or right, but not up, since up is opposite to down.\n\nBut let's verify with positions.\n\nPositions: head at (5,4), then (5,5) at index 1, which is (x,y) = (5,5), so y=5, which is greater than y=4, so it's below.\n\nSo the segment behind head is at (5,5), meaning at the previous turn, head was at (5,5), and it moved to (5,4). Moving from (5,5) to (5,4): y from 5 to 4, which is decreasing y, so upward move.\n\nBut direction is given as D (down), which is inconsistent.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in my understanding.\n\nList of positions: [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)]\n\nSo head: (5,4)\n\nSegment 1: (5,5) – below head\n\nSegment 2: (4,5) – left of segment 1\n\nSegment 3: (3,5) – left\n\nSegment 4: (2,5) – left\n\nSegment 5: (2,6) – down from (2,5)\n\nSegment 6: (1,6) – left from (2,6)\n\nSegment 7: (1,5) – up from (1,6)\n\nSegment 8: (1,4) – up from (1,5)\n\nAt turn 18, head was at (5,5), and it moved to (5,4) by moving up (decrease y). So the last move direction was up, not down.\n\nBut the input says \"Snake Head Direction: D\" which is down. Contradiction.\n\nPerhaps \"Head Direction\" is the direction it is facing for the next move. So at turn 19, after moving to (5,4), it is facing down, so it can move down to (5,5), but (5,5) is occupied by the body, so it can't move there because it would collide.\n\nLet's assume that \"Head Direction\" is the current facing direction for the next move.\n\nSo at turn 19, head at (5,4), facing down, so possible moves: down to (5,5), left to (4,4), right to (6,4), or up to (5,3), but up is opposite to down, so it cannot move up because of no instant reverse.\n\nRule: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nCurrent direction is down, so cannot move up. So possible moves: down, left, right.\n\nBut down to (5,5): (5,5) is occupied by the body, so it would collide if it moves there.\n\n(5,5) is the first body segment, so if head moves to (5,5), it would be on the same cell as the body, causing collision.\n\nUnless the body moves away, but in snake, when head moves, the tail moves, so the cell that was tail is vacated, but the cell that was neck becomes new tail, etc.\n\nSpecifically, when head moves to a new cell, the tail end moves forward, so the cell that was tail is freed, but other body cells remain until the tail moves.\n\nIf head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by the body, it collides, except if it's the tail cell and the tail moves away at the same time.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, if the head moves to the tail cell, it's ok because the tail moves away, so no collision. But if it moves to any other body segment, it collides.\n\nIn this case, the tail is at (1,4), and head is at (5,4), so (5,5) is not the tail; it's the second segment, so moving to (5,5) would collide with the body.\n\nSimilarly, other cells.\n\nBack to direction: input says head direction is \"D\" down. But from positions, it was moving up to get to (5,4), so why is direction down?\n\nPerhaps the direction is the intended direction for the next move or something. I think there might be a misinterpretation.\n\nLet's look at the state: \"Snake Positions\":[(5,4), (5,5), (4,5), ...] and \"Snake Head Direction\": D\n\nI think for consistency, we should take the direction as given, so current head facing is down, so for turn 19, it can move down, left, or right, not up.\n\nAnd from positions, the cell below (5,4) is (5,5), which is occupied, so moving down to (5,5) is impossible because it's a body collision.\n\nSimilarly, left to (4,4), or right to (6,4).\n\n(6,4) is x=6, y=4, walls at x=7, so x=6 is within 1 to 6? Walls at x=0 and x=7, so x from 1 to 6 are free, except obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,6), not (6,4).\n\nSo (6,4) should be free, unless it's a wall or something.\n\nWalls: border x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7, so (6,4) is x=6, y=4, not border, and not internal obstacle (which is (5,6)), so (6,4) should be empty.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) should be empty.\n\n(5,3) is above, but moving up is not allowed due to no reverse.\n\nSo possible moves from (5,4) with direction down: down, left, right.\n\n- Down to (5,5): but (5,5) is occupied by body, collision, not allowed.\n\n- Left to (4,4): let's see if occupied. Snake positions: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4). So (4,4) is not in the list, so empty.\n\n- Right to (6,4): not in list, not wall, so empty.\n\nSo from (5,4), with direction down, possible actions are L or R, not D or U.\n\nU is not possible because reverse, D is not possible because collision.\n\nSo only L or R for turn 19.\n\nBut we need to think 5+ turns ahead, so let's list the food.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (5,1, 7, 1)  // (x,y) = (5,1), value=1, life_span=7\n\n- (4,3, 10, 1)  // (4,3), value=1, life_span=10\n\nBoth are positive food, value +1.\n\nLife span: for (5,1), life_span=7, so it disappears after 7 turns, including current turn? Countdown decreases every turn, including current.\n\nSo at turn 19, life_span=7, so it will disappear after turn 19+6 = turn 25? Let's see: at turn t, life_span N, it disappears after N turns, meaning on turn t+N it is gone.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\" and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 19, life_span=7, so after 7 turns, on turn 26 it disappears? Countdown: at turn 19, countdown=7, turn 20 countdown=6, ..., turn 25 countdown=1, turn 26 countdown=0, so it disappears at turn 26, before or after the turn? Probably after the turn or at the start of next turn? The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", so on turn t+N it is no longer there.\n\nSimilarly, for (4,3), life_span=10, at turn 19, so disappears at turn 29.\n\nNow, grid size: walls at x=0,7 y=0,7, so playable area x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (5,6) is obstacle.\n\n(5,6) is internal obstacle, so not accessible.\n\nCurrent snake positions: head (5,4), body: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)\n\nTail at (1,4).\n\nFood at (5,1) and (4,3).\n\n(5,1) is directly below? y=1, which is above y=4 if y=0 top, so (5,1) is above (5,4).\n\nSimilarly, (4,3) is left and above.\n\nNow, for turn 19, I must choose action: L or R.\n\nBut I need to think ahead multiple turns.\n\nAlso, note that if I eat food, snake grows, so length increases by 1 for positive food.\n\nBut for negative food, no growth, but here both are positive.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid rows y=1 to 6, columns x=1 to 6.\n\ny=1 top, y=6 bottom.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,6), so (5,6) is wall.\n\nSnake:\nHead: (5,4)\nBody: (5,5) at (5,5)\n(4,5) at (4,5)\n(3,5) at (3,5)\n(2,5) at (2,5)\n(2,6) at (2,6)  // y=6 bottom\n(1,6) at (1,6)  // bottom left\n(1,5) at (1,5)  // left, above (1,6)\n(1,4) at (1,4)  // tail, left side\n\nFood:\n(5,1) at (5,1)  // top, x=5, y=1\n(4,3) at (4,3)  // x=4, y=3\n\nNow, head at (5,4), facing down (direction D), so cannot move up (reverse), cannot move down (to (5,5) occupied), so only left to (4,4) or right to (6,4).\n\n(4,4) is empty, (6,4) is empty.\n\nI need to choose which way to go to maximize score and avoid risks, thinking 5+ turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving left to (4,4).\n\nIf move left to (4,4) at turn 19.\n\nThen snake positions: head moves to (4,4), body follows, so tail (1,4) is removed? When head moves to new cell, the tail end moves forward, so the segment at (1,4) is removed, and the new tail is the previous segment before tail, which is (1,5)? Let's see.\n\nCurrent positions: [ (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4) ]\n\nAfter moving left to (4,4): new head at (4,4), then the previous head (5,4) becomes new segment 1, then (5,5) becomes segment 2, etc., up to (1,5) becomes new segment 8, and tail (1,4) is removed.\n\nSo new positions: [ (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) ]\n\nTail at (1,5).\n\nHead now at (4,4), and direction was down, but after moving left, new direction is left, so for next turn, direction left, can move left, up, down, not right (reverse).\n\nNow, from (4,4), possible moves: left to (3,4), up to (4,3), down to (4,5), or right to (5,4), but right is reverse, not allowed.\n\n(4,5) is occupied by body? In new positions, (4,5) is segment 3, so moving to (4,5) would collide.\n\n(3,4) not in positions, should be empty.\n\n(4,3) has food, value 1, life span 10.\n\n(4,3) is food position.\n\nIf move up to (4,3), it can eat the food.\n\nBut need to check if it's safe.\n\nFood at (4,3), value +1, so if eaten, snake grows, so after eating, the tail doesn't move, so length increases.\n\nRule: when eating positive food, length +1, so tail stays in place.\n\nIn this case, if at turn 20, from (4,4) move up to (4,3), eat food, then head to (4,3), and body: previous head (4,4) becomes segment 1, then (5,4), (5,5), etc., and tail (1,5) stays, so new tail is (1,5), and length is 10.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, for turn 19, if I move left to (4,4), then at turn 20, from (4,4) with direction left (since last move was left), so can move left, up, down, not right.\n\n- Left to (3,4): empty? Probably.\n\n- Up to (4,3): food, can eat.\n\n- Down to (4,5): but (4,5) is body segment, collision, not allowed.\n\nSo only left or up.\n\nIf I go up to (4,3) and eat, then snake grows to length 10.\n\nThen head at (4,3), direction up.\n\nNow, what about the other food at (5,1).\n\n(5,1) is at (5,1), which is above.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nIf I move right at turn 19 to (6,4).\n\nFrom (5,4) move right to (6,4).\n\nThen new positions: head (6,4), then (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)  // tail (1,4) removed, new tail (1,5)\n\nHead at (6,4), direction now right (since moved right).\n\nFrom (6,4), possible moves: right to (7,4) but x=7 is wall, collision, not allowed.\n\nUp to (6,3), down to (6,5), left to (5,4), but left is reverse? Direction is right, so moving left is opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo can move up or down.\n\n- Up to (6,3): empty?\n\n- Down to (6,5): empty? (6,5) is within bounds, not wall, not obstacle.\n\n(6,5) is x=6,y=5, should be free.\n\nBut no food there.\n\nNow, comparing the two options for turn 19: left or right.\n\nIf left to (4,4), I can potentially go to (4,3) next turn and eat food.\n\nIf right to (6,4), I can go up or down, but no food immediately.\n\nThe food at (4,3) has life span 10, so until turn 29, plenty of time.\n\n(5,1) has life span 7, so disappears at turn 26.\n\nTurn 19 now, so (5,1) gone after turn 25? Countdown: at turn 19, life=7, turn 20 life=6, turn 21=5, ..., turn 25 life=1, turn 26 life=0, gone. So available from turn 19 to 25 inclusive? At turn 25, if head on it, can eat before it disappears.\n\nSimilarly for (4,3), available until turn 28.\n\nNow, also, need to avoid risks, like getting trapped or colliding.\n\nFirst, let's consider the area.\n\nThe snake is long, 9 segments, in the bottom-left area, with head at (5,4).\n\nThe food at (4,3) is close, at (4,3).\n\nFood at (5,1) is at top, x=5,y=1.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,6), so bottom row y=6 has obstacle at x=5.\n\nNow, if I go left to (4,4), then I can eat (4,3) on turn 20 if I move up.\n\nBut after eating, head at (4,3), and the body is behind.\n\nNow, from (4,3), with direction up, can move up, left, right, not down (reverse).\n\n- Up to (4,2): empty? y=2, x=4, should be free.\n\n- Left to (3,3): free?\n\n- Right to (5,3): but (5,3) might be free or not.\n\n(5,3) not occupied, no wall.\n\nBut (5,3) is above (5,4), etc.\n\nAfter eating at (4,3), snake length 10, positions: head (4,3), then (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)  // since ate, tail didn't move, so (1,5) is still there, and new segment added, so positions: [ (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) ]? When eating, the head moves to food, and a new segment is added at the tail, so tail stays.\n\nStandard: when eat, head moves to food cell, and a new body segment is added at the position where the tail was, so tail doesn't move, and new segment is added.\n\nSo previous tail (1,5) becomes the new tail, and a new segment is added there, but since tail didn't move, the segment is added at the same position? No.\n\nPositions: before move, tail at (1,5) (after turn 19 move to (4,4), tail was at (1,5)).\n\nAt turn 20, if move to (4,3) and eat, head to (4,3), then the body: previous head (4,4) becomes segment 1, and so on, up to previous segment before tail, and since ate, the tail stays, so the new tail is the previous tail position, but with the segment added.\n\nLet's index.\n\nAt turn 20 after move to (4,4) (from turn 19), positions: [ (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) ]  // length 9, tail (1,5)\n\nThen at turn 20, move up to (4,3), eat food, so head to (4,3), new segment added at tail, so the tail position (1,5) has a new segment, so the body includes (4,4), then (5,4), ..., up to (1,6), and (1,5) with an additional segment at (1,5)? No.\n\nThe list grows: the new positions are [ new head (4,3), then the previous head (4,4), then the previous segments in order: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), and then the previous tail (1,5) is kept, so now tail at (1,5), but it's the same cell, but with a segment there.\n\nSince the tail didn't move, the new segment is added at the tail position, so the snake has one more segment at (1,5).\n\nSo positions: [ (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) ]  // 10 segments, head (4,3), tail (1,5)\n\nNow, head at (4,3), direction up.\n\nFrom here, can move up to (4,2), left to (3,3), or right to (5,3), not down (reverse).\n\n(4,2) should be empty.\n\n(3,3) empty.\n\n(5,3) empty.\n\nNow, the food at (5,1) is to the right and up.\n\nI could move right to (5,3), then to (5,2), then to (5,1) to eat.\n\nBut (5,1) has life span 7, so must be eaten by turn 25.\n\nTurn 20 now, so I have time.\n\nBut let's see if there are risks.\n\nThe body is spread out, but there might be space.\n\nFrom (4,3), if I move right to (5,3).\n\nThen at turn 21, head to (5,3), no food there, so just move, tail moves.\n\nPositions: head (5,3), then (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), etc., tail (1,6) or something.\n\nSince no eat, tail moves, so the last segment (1,5) is removed, new tail is (1,6).\n\nBut not important.\n\nThen from (5,3), direction right (since moved right from (4,3)? From (4,3) to (5,3) is right move, so direction right.\n\nCan move up to (5,2), right to (6,3), or down to (5,4), but down is y+1, to (5,4), which is occupied? (5,4) is in body.\n\nAfter moving to (5,3), positions: head (5,3), then (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), ... so (5,4) is segment 3, so moving down to (5,4) would collide.\n\nAlso, moving down is opposite to up? Direction is right, so moving down is not opposite; opposite would be left.\n\nDirections: from direction right, can move up, down, right, not left (reverse).\n\n- Up to (5,2): empty\n\n- Right to (6,3): empty\n\n- Down to (5,4): but occupied, collision\n\nSo only up or right.\n\nIf up to (5,2), then from there to (5,1) to eat.\n\n(5,2) to (5,1) is up, y decrease.\n\nThen eat at (5,1).\n\nBut need to check if possible.\n\nAt turn 21, from (5,3) move up to (5,2).\n\nThen positions: head (5,2), then (5,3), (4,3), etc.\n\nThen turn 22, from (5,2) move up to (5,1), eat food.\n\nHead to (5,1), grow, so new segment at tail.\n\nNow, after eating (4,3) at turn 20, and then (5,1) at turn 22, I have eaten two foods.\n\nBut are there any dangers?\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (5,6), but I'm in the top area.\n\nBut let's see the space.\n\nAfter eating both, the snake is longer, 11 segments, and the grid is 6x6 minus obstacle, so 36 -1 =35 cells, but walls border, so playable cells: x1-6,y1-6, 6x6=36 cells, minus obstacle (5,6), so 35 cells.\n\nSnake length 11, so plenty of space.\n\nBut need to avoid dead ends.\n\nNow, back to turn 19 choice.\n\nIf at turn 19 I move right to (6,4).\n\nThen positions: head (6,4), then (5,4), (5,5), etc., tail (1,5)\n\nDirection right.\n\nThen at turn 20, from (6,4) can move up to (6,3) or down to (6,5), not left or right (right to wall, left reverse).\n\n- Up to (6,3)\n\n- Down to (6,5)\n\nSay I go up to (6,3).\n\nThen head (6,3), direction up.\n\nThen I can go left to (5,3) or up to (6,2), etc.\n\nBut food at (4,3) and (5,1) are on the left.\n\n(4,3) is at (4,3), so from (6,3) I can move left to (5,3), then to (4,3) to eat.\n\nBut (4,3) might be eaten earlier if I go left first, but in this path, I'm at (6,3) at turn 20.\n\nIf I went left at turn 19, I could eat (4,3) at turn 20.\n\nBy going right, I delay eating (4,3).\n\nSimilarly, for (5,1), it has shorter life.\n\n(5,1) life 7, turn 19 to 25.\n\nIf I go left at turn 19, I can eat (4,3) at turn 20, then (5,1) at turn 22, as above.\n\nIf I go right at turn 19, to (6,4), then turn 20 to (6,3), turn 21 to (5,3), turn 22 to (4,3) to eat (4,3) at turn 22, later than turn 20.\n\nThen for (5,1), from (4,3) after eating, I can go to (4,2) or (5,3), etc., but to reach (5,1), I need to go via (5,2) or something.\n\nFrom (4,3) after eating at turn 22, head at (4,3), I can move right to (5,3) at turn 23, then up to (5,2) at turn 24, then up to (5,1) at turn 25 to eat, just before it disappears at turn 26.\n\nSo I can still eat both, but later.\n\nBut going left path, I eat (4,3) earlier, at turn 20, and (5,1) at turn 22.\n\nGoing right path, eat (4,3) at turn 22, (5,1) at turn 25.\n\nSince both give +1, same score, but eating earlier might be better to free space or something, but not necessary.\n\nBut there might be risks.\n\nAnother thing: the tail reward danger.\n\nIf head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because collision.\n\nBut currently, tail is at (1,4) or after moves, but not near head.\n\nIn this case, no food on tail, so no issue.\n\nNow, let's see if one path is safer.\n\nFirst, if I go left to (4,4) at turn 19.\n\nThen to (4,3) at turn 20, eat, grow.\n\nHead at (4,3), direction up.\n\nThen I can go to (5,3) at turn 21, as before.\n\nFrom (4,3), to (5,3), right.\n\nThen (5,3) to (5,2) up at turn 22? Turn 21: from (4,3) move right to (5,3), direction right.\n\nThen turn 22, from (5,3) move up to (5,2), direction up.\n\nThen turn 23, from (5,2) move up to (5,1), eat.\n\nAll good.\n\nAfter eating (5,1), head at (5,1), direction up.\n\nThen I can move left, right, down, but down is reverse? Direction up, so cannot move down.\n\nCan move left to (4,1), right to (6,1), up to (5,0) but y=0 wall, not allowed.\n\nSo only left or right.\n\n(4,1) or (6,1).\n\nGrid is small, but snake is long, 11 segments, but many cells free.\n\nTotal cells: 36 -1 obstacle =35, snake 11, so 24 free, but with walls.\n\nBut need to avoid trapping itself.\n\nFor example, after being at (5,1), if I move left to (4,1), then I might be in top-left corner.\n\nBut I can go down or right from there.\n\nSimilarly, if go right to (6,1), top-right.\n\nBut since I came from below, the body is trailing.\n\nNow, the internal obstacle at (5,6), but not affecting top.\n\nNow, the other path: if at turn 19 I go right to (6,4).\n\nThen turn 20, say move up to (6,3).\n\nHead (6,3), direction up.\n\nTurn 21, move left to (5,3), direction left? From (6,3) to (5,3) is left move, so direction left.\n\nThen turn 22, move left to (4,3), eat food at (4,3).\n\nThen head at (4,3), direction left.\n\nThen to reach (5,1), I need to go right or up.\n\nFrom (4,3), can move up to (4,2), left to (3,3), or down to (4,4), but down is y+1, to (4,4), which may be occupied.\n\nAfter eating at (4,3) at turn 22, positions similar to before but later.\n\nHead (4,3), then (5,3)? After move to (4,3) from (5,3), so positions: head (4,3), then (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), etc., and tail somewhere.\n\nBut to go to (5,1), from (4,3) I can move right to (5,3) at turn 23, but (5,3) might be occupied.\n\nAt turn 22 after eating: head to (4,3), previous head was (5,3) at turn 21, so new segment added at tail.\n\nPrevious positions before move: at turn 21, head at (5,3), positions: [ (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), ... ] tail.\n\nThen move to (4,3) at turn 22, eat, so head (4,3), then (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), ..., and new tail segment, so tail position same as before.\n\n(5,3) is now segment 1, so moving to (5,3) from (4,3) at turn 23 would collide, since (5,3) is occupied.\n\nTherefore, from (4,3) after eating, I cannot move right to (5,3) because it's the body.\n\nI can only move up to (4,2) or left to (3,3), not down to (4,4) if occupied.\n\nIn this case, from (4,3), with direction left (since moved left to get there), can move left, up, down, not right (reverse).\n\n- Left to (3,3)\n\n- Up to (4,2)\n\n- Down to (4,4): but (4,4) may be occupied.\n\nIn the positions after eating: head (4,3), segment1 (5,3), segment2 (6,3), etc., so (4,4) not in the list? Let's see the sequence.\n\nAfter turn 22 move: head at (4,3), then previous head (5,3), then (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), and tail (1,5) with new segment, so (1,5) is tail.\n\n(4,4) is not occupied; it was not in the path recently.\n\nFor example, at turn 19, when I moved right to (6,4), positions: [ (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) ]\n\nTurn 20 move up to (6,3): head (6,3), then (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)  // tail (1,5) removed? No, when move without eat, tail moves.\n\nAt turn 20, from (6,4) move to (6,3), no eat, so head to (6,3), tail (1,5) removed, new positions: [ (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6) ]  // tail (1,6)\n\nThen turn 21 move left to (5,3): head (5,3), then (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)  // tail (1,6) removed? Tail was (1,6), removed, new tail (2,6)\n\nPositions: [ (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) ]  // 9 segments, tail (2,6)\n\nThen turn 22 move left to (4,3) and eat, so head (4,3), then (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), and new segment at tail, so (2,6) has new segment, so tail at (2,6).\n\nPositions: [ (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) ]  // 10 segments.\n\nNow head at (4,3), direction left (since moved left).\n\nCan move:\n\n- Left to (3,3): empty\n\n- Up to (4,2): empty\n\n- Down to (4,4): (4,4) not in positions, should be empty.\n\n- But not right, reverse.\n\n(4,4) is free, so can move down to (4,4).\n\nBut (4,4) is below, y=4.\n\nTo reach (5,1), I need to go up.\n\nFrom (4,3), I can move up to (4,2) or left to (3,3), but not directly to (5,1).\n\nIf I move up to (4,2) at turn 23.\n\nThen head (4,2), direction up? Last move up.\n\nThen turn 24, move up to (4,1), or left to (3,2), right to (5,2), etc.\n\n(4,1) is available, but no food.\n\nThen to (5,1), I need to go right.\n\nFrom (4,2), move right to (5,2) at turn 24.\n\nThen turn 25, from (5,2) move up to (5,1) to eat.\n\nBut at turn 25, (5,1) still there, life=1, can eat.\n\nSo possible, but tight.\n\nIf from (4,3) after eating, I move down to (4,4), then I go away from (5,1), harder to reach.\n\nBut I can still reach via other paths.\n\nHowever, in the left path at turn 19, I eat both foods earlier and with more buffer.\n\nMoreover, in the right path, when I go to (6,4), I might be near the border, and with the obstacle at (5,6), but not immediate issue.\n\nBut let's consider the space around head.\n\nAt turn 19, head at (5,4), with body at (5,5) below, so I cannot go down.\n\nLeft to (4,4) is open, right to (6,4) open.\n\nBut if I go right to (6,4), I am at the right border, x=6.\n\nThen from there, only up or down, since left reverse not allowed immediately, but after moving, direction changes.\n\nBut the right side has less space, x=6 is wall, so I can only go up or down along the wall.\n\nWhereas left to (4,4) is more central, and closer to food.\n\nAlso, the food at (4,3) is only 1 step away if I go left then up.\n\nMoreover, after eating (4,3), I can easily access (5,1).\n\nIf I go right, I take longer to eat (4,3), and then reaching (5,1) is rushed near the end of life span.\n\nAdditionally, there might be risks of dead ends.\n\nFor example, if I go to (6,4), then up to (6,3), then left to (5,3), then to (4,3), but after that, the body might block paths.\n\nBut in this case, since grid is small, it might be ok.\n\nBut to maximize survival, going left seems better.\n\nAnother point: the tail is at (1,4), which is near bottom-left.\n\nWhen I move, the tail moves, freeing space.\n\nBut in the short term, going left allows faster food consumption.\n\nNow, about the food life: (5,1) has shorter life, so I should prioritize eating it if possible, but in both paths I can eat it.\n\nIn left path, I eat it at turn 22, in right path at turn 25.\n\nSince no other food, and I need to survive, eating earlier gives more flexibility.\n\nBut after eating, snake longer, might be harder to maneuvre.\n\nBut with 35 cells and snake 11, still 24 free, should be fine.\n\nI could not eat immediately and plan longer.\n\nBut the goal is to maximize score, so eating both is good.\n\nNow, is there any negative food? No, both positive.\n\nSo I think moving left at turn 19 is better.\n\nThen, for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the question is to think ahead but output for current and future turns? The answer format is to output for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions starting from t1.\n\nIn the answer format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ... }\n\nAnd it says \"action on turn t1\", etc.\n\nBut I need to decide for turn 19, and perhaps a few more.\n\nBut since I need to think ahead, I should plan a sequence.\n\nBut the snake can react to future states, but since no new food spawn, I can plan a path.\n\nBut the food life decreases, so I need to consider.\n\nAlso, the state might change with moves.\n\nBut for now, I'll assume I move left at turn 19.\n\nThen turn 20, move up to (4,3) to eat.\n\nThen turn 21, move right to (5,3)\n\nTurn 22, move up to (5,2)\n\nTurn 23, move up to (5,1) to eat.\n\nThen after that, I need to survive.\n\nBut the output might not need to go that far, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should consider up to turn 24 or so.\n\nBut for answer, I can output a sequence.\n\nPerhaps output for t1 to t1+4 or something.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFirst, at turn 19, action: L (left to (4,4))\n\nThen turn 20: U (up to (4,3) to eat)\n\nThen turn 21: from (4,3), after eating, head at (4,3), direction up? Last move was up to (4,3), so direction up.\n\nCan move up to (4,2), left to (3,3), right to (5,3), not down.\n\nI plan to go to (5,3), so R (right)\n\nThen turn 22: from (5,3), direction right (since moved right), can move up to (5,2), down to (5,4) but occupied, right to (6,3), etc. Move U (up to (5,2))\n\nThen turn 23: from (5,2), direction up, move U to (5,1) to eat.\n\nBut turn 23 is t1+4? t1=19, turn 20: t1+1, turn 21: t1+2, turn 22: t1+3, turn 23: t1+4.\n\nI can output up to there.\n\nBut after that, I need to think beyond for survival.\n\nAt (5,1), after eating, head at (5,1), direction up.\n\nCan move L to (4,1), R to (6,1), not D.\n\n(4,1) or (6,1).\n\nSay move L to (4,1), then from there, I can go down or right.\n\nBut to avoid corner, perhaps better to move R to (6,1), but both similar.\n\nSince I have time, but no more food, I just need to survive.\n\nBut for the sequence, I can stop at turn 23.\n\nNow, what about the other move? If I go right at turn 19.\n\nBut I think left is better.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (5,6), but not affecting this path.\n\nAlso, the food at (5,1) might be under snake? But not, it's free.\n\nRule about food under body: but here no food under body, both are free cells.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, I think for turn 19, move left.\n\nThen the sequence: turn 19: L, turn 20: U, turn 21: R, turn 22: U, turn 23: U to eat (5,1).\n\nAt turn 22, to (5,2), then turn 23 to (5,1).\n\nYes.\n\nIn the output, I need to specify the actions.\n\nBut for turn 19, only L or R possible, and L leads to faster food.\n\nTo confirm, let's see if moving right has advantage.\n\nSuppose at turn 19 move R to (6,4)\n\nThen turn 20 move U to (6,3)\n\nTurn 21 move L to (5,3)\n\nTurn 22 move L to (4,3) eat\n\nThen turn 23 from (4,3) move U to (4,2)\n\nTurn 24 move R to (5,2)\n\nTurn 25 move U to (5,1) eat\n\nSo it takes two more turns to eat the first food, and (5,1) eaten at last moment.\n\nWhereas with left, I eat both earlier.\n\nMoreover, in the right path, when at (6,4), moving to (6,3), then (5,3), etc., I am near the border, which might be riskier if I need to turn, but not immediately.\n\nBut since I go to (4,3) later, the body might be different.\n\nBut overall, the left path seems more efficient and less risky.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with left.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 19: L\n\nTurn 20: U (to eat (4,3))\n\nTurn 21: R (to (5,3))\n\nTurn 22: U (to (5,2))\n\nTurn 23: U (to (5,1) eat)\n\nI think this is fine.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to output in the box.\n\nAlso, the head direction changes, but I think I have it.\n\nNow, about thinking ahead: after turn 23, I need to survive, but no more food, so I can just move safely.\n\nBut for the sequence, up to turn 23 is 5 turns from t1? t1=19, turn 20,21,22,23: that's 4 turns ahead, but including t1, 5 actions? Turn t1 to t1+4 is 5 turns.\n\nt1: action, t1+1, t1+2, t1+3, t1+4.\n\nYes.\n\nSo output that.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan for Turn 19\n\n**Current State Summary:**\n- **Turn**: 19\n- **Grid**: 6x6 playable area (x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6), with walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and internal obstacle at (5,6).\n- **Snake**: \n  - Positions: Head at (5,4), body segments at [(5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)] (tail at (1,4)).\n  - Length: 9 segments.\n  - Current direction: Down (D). Cannot move up (reverse) or down (occupied by body at (5,5)).\n- **Food**:\n  - (5,1): Value +1, life span 7 (disappears after turn 25).\n  - (4,3): Value +1, life span 10 (disappears after turn 28).\n- **Possible moves from (5,4) at turn 19**: Only left (L) to (4,4) or right (R) to (6,4), as down is blocked and up is reverse.\n\n**Strategic Thinking (5+ Turns Ahead):**\n- **Prioritize eating (4,3) first**: It is closer to the current head position and can be eaten quickly with minimal risk. Eating it early provides a growth advantage and frees space for maneuvering toward (5,1).\n- **Then target (5,1)**: It has a shorter life span (disappears after turn 25) and must be eaten by turn 25. A path via (4,4) → (4,3) → (5,3) → (5,2) → (5,1) is efficient and low-risk.\n- **Avoid risks**:\n  - Moving right to (6,4) at turn 19 leads to the border, reducing mobility and delaying access to food. It requires more turns to reach (4,3) and (5,1), increasing the chance of missing (5,1) due to its shorter life.\n  - The left path (to (4,4)) is central, avoids borders, and provides better access to both foods.\n  - After eating both foods, the snake length increases to 11, but the grid has 35 free cells (36 cells minus obstacle), leaving ample space for survival. No negative food or tail reward dangers exist.\n- **Sequence for turns 19-23**:\n  - Turn 19: Move left (L) to (4,4) – opens path to (4,3) and avoids border risks.\n  - Turn 20: Move up (U) to (4,3) – eat food (value +1, length now 10).\n  - Turn 21: Move right (R) to (5,3) – position for approach to (5,1).\n  - Turn 22: Move up (U) to (5,2) – closer to (5,1).\n  - Turn 23: Move up (U) to (5,1) – eat food (value +1, length now 11) before it disappears.\n- **Survival beyond turn 23**: After eating (5,1), the head is at (5,1) facing up. Possible moves include left to (4,1) or right to (6,1) (not down, reverse). With 24 free cells, the snake can navigate safely by avoiding body and walls (e.g., move toward open areas like (4,1) or (6,1) and then downward).\n\n**Conclusion**: The left path is optimal, eating both foods by turn 23 with minimal risk and efficient use of food life spans. This maximizes score (+2 from food) and ensures long-term survival.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 19: L (left)  \nTurn 20: U (up)  \nTurn 21: R (right)  \nTurn 22: U (up)  \nTurn 23: U (up)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 20, and I'm the AI controlling the snake. The goal is to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks, thinking at least 5 turns ahead.\n\n**Grid Setup:**\n- Walls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), with borders being walls.\n- Internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\n**Snake:**\n- Positions: Head is at (4,4), then body: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5). So the snake has 9 segments.\n- Head direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left to (4,4) from (5,4)? Let's see the positions: from head to tail: (4,4) <- head, (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), etc. Since head is at (4,4) and previous was (5,4), and direction is L, that makes sense because from (5,4) to (4,4) is left.\n\n**Food:**\n- Two food items:\n  - (5,1) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n  - (4,3) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n\nBoth are positive food, so eating them increases length by 1 and gives +1 score.\n\nLife span: For (5,1), life span 6 means it disappears after 6 turns, including the current turn. So on turn 20, life span 6, so it will disappear after turn 25? Let's clarify life span countdown.\n\nThe problem says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\". So at turn t, if life span is N, it decreases to N-1 at turn t+1, and disappears when it reaches 0. So for (5,1) at turn 20, life span 6, so:\n\n- Turn 20: life span 6\n- Turn 21: 5\n- Turn 22: 4\n- Turn 23: 3\n- Turn 24: 2\n- Turn 25: 1\n- Turn 26: 0, disappears\n\nSimilarly for (4,3) with life span 9:\n\n- Turn 20: 9\n- Turn 21: 8\n- ...\n- Disappears after turn 28 (when life span 0).\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns. The answer should be a sequence of actions starting from turn 20.\n\nFirst, let's map out the grid for clarity.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders and (5,6).\n\nSnake positions:\n- Head: (4,4)\n- Body: (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) — that's 8 body segments, so total 9 cells.\n\nSince head is at (4,4), and direction is L, last move was left.\n\nPossible moves from (4,4):\n- Up (U): (4,5)\n- Down (D): (4,3)\n- Left (L): (3,4)\n- Right (R): (5,4)\n\nBut I need to check for collisions and walls.\n\nFirst, walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also, (5,6) is an obstacle.\n\nNow, snake body: current positions are occupied, but when moving, the tail moves, so only the head position matters for collision, and we need to avoid walls and body segments except the tail.\n\nCollision rules:\n- If head moves to a wall, dead.\n- If head moves to a body segment, dead, unless it's the tail segment and we're moving into it, but then after moving, the tail moves away, so it's safe only if the head moves to the current tail position, and the tail moves, so no collision.\n\nSpecifically: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nAlso, for food under body: if food is under a body segment, it can only be eaten if the body moves away and then head moves onto it. But in this case, I need to see if any food is under snake.\n\nFood positions: (5,1) and (4,3). Snake positions: let's list all snake cells: (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5). None of these are (5,1) or (4,3), so food is not under snake. (5,1) is at y=1, snake is around y=4-6, so no. (4,3) is at y=3, not occupied. So both food are free to eat if head moves there.\n\nNow, head direction is L, so I cannot move right (opposite) on the next turn because of \"no instant reverse\". So from current direction L, I cannot move R immediately.\n\nPossible actions at turn 20:\n- U: to (4,5)\n- D: to (4,3)\n- L: to (3,4)\n- R: not allowed because reverse from L.\n\nR is to (5,4), which is the first body segment. But since it's not the tail, moving there would cause collision because (5,4) is a body segment, not tail.\n\nTail is at (1,5), so (5,4) is not tail, it's the neck or something.\n\nSo moving to (5,4) would be body collision.\n\nSimilarly, moving to (4,5): what is at (4,5)? Snake positions: (4,5) is the fourth segment? Positions: index 0: head (4,4), 1: (5,4), 2: (5,5), 3: (4,5), 4: (3,5), etc. So (4,5) is occupied by the snake body, not tail.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) is not in snake positions? Let's see: snake has (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5). So (3,4) is not listed, so it should be empty.\n\n(4,3) is food, not snake.\n\n(4,5) is snake body.\n\nSo from (4,4):\n\n- U: to (4,5) — but (4,5) is occupied by snake body (segment 3), so collision, dead.\n\n- D: to (4,3) — (4,3) has food, positive, and not occupied by snake, so can move there, eat food, snake grows to 10 segments.\n\n- L: to (3,4) — (3,4) is empty, no wall, so safe move, no food.\n\n- R: to (5,4) — (5,4) is occupied by snake body (segment 1), not tail, so collision, dead. Also, reverse direction not allowed, so impossible anyway.\n\nSo only possible moves are D or L.\n\nD: to (4,3), eat food, grow.\n\nL: to (3,4), no food, no growth.\n\nBut I need to think long-term, 5+ turns ahead.\n\nAlso, there's the food at (5,1) and (4,3). (4,3) is directly below, so if I move D, I eat it immediately.\n\nBut (5,1) is far, at y=1, while snake is at y=4, so I need to go down.\n\nMoreover, life span: (5,1) has life span 6, so it will disappear after turn 25 if not eaten. (4,3) has life span 9, disappears after turn 28.\n\nSince (4,3) is closer, and I can eat it now, but is it safe?\n\nMoving to (4,3) from (4,4) with direction L, but after moving, the new head position is (4,3), and direction becomes D? No, direction is the direction I moved, but for the next move, I need to set the new direction.\n\nThe head direction will be updated to the move I make.\n\nNow, after eating (4,3), snake grows, so the tail doesn't move; new segment added at head.\n\nSnake positions after move D to (4,3):\n\n- New head: (4,3)\n\n- Then previous head: (4,4) becomes body, so body: (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) — but since eaten, tail stays, so positions: head (4,3), then (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) — 10 segments.\n\nNow, from there, I need to plan next moves.\n\nBut let's consider not eating now and moving L to (3,4).\n\nFirst, let's evaluate options for turn 20.\n\nOption 1: Move D to (4,3) — eat food, grow, score +1.\n\nThen snake at (4,3) with direction D.\n\nOption 2: Move L to (3,4) — no food, snake moves, tail moves, so positions: head to (3,4), then body: (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6) — tail (1,5) moves away, so new tail is (1,6)? Let's see: when moving, head moves to new position, each segment moves to previous position, so tail (1,5) is removed, and new positions: head (3,4), then (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6) — (1,6) was second last, now last, and (1,5) is gone.\n\nPositions: before move: [(4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)]\n\nAfter move L to (3,4): head to (3,4), then each body segment moves to previous position: segment 1 (was (5,4)) moves to (4,4), segment 2 ( (5,5) ) moves to (5,4)? No.\n\nStandard snake movement: when moving, the head moves to the new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n\nSo positions list: index 0: head, 1,2,3,... tail.\n\nAfter move, new head position, then the body segments take the positions of the old segments from 0 to n-2, and if no food, tail is removed.\n\nIn this case, no food eaten, so tail removed.\n\nSo new positions: new head at (3,4), then the first body segment at old head position (4,4), then old segment 1 at (5,4), old segment 2 at (5,5), old segment 3 at (4,5), old segment 4 at (3,5), old segment 5 at (2,5), old segment 6 at (2,6), old segment 7 at (1,6), and old segment 8 (tail) at (1,5) is removed.\n\nSo new positions: [(3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)]\n\nNow tail is at (1,6).\n\nDirection is now L, since I moved left.\n\nNow, back to turn 20 decision.\n\nIf I move D to (4,3), I eat food, grow to 10 segments, and I'm at (4,3) with direction D.\n\nIf I move L to (3,4), no food, snake shrinks to 8 segments? No, length same, but tail moved, so positions changed, length still 9? Before move, 9 segments, after move no food, so 8 segments? Let's count.\n\nInitial positions: 9 cells.\n\nAfter move with no food: head moves to new position, tail removed, so 8 segments.\n\nAfter move with food: head moves to food, tail not removed, new head added, so 10 segments.\n\nIn option 1 (D to (4,3) with food): new positions 10 segments.\n\nOption 2 (L to (3,4) no food): new positions 8 segments? 9 segments minus tail removed, so 8.\n\nInitial: 9 segments.\n\nAfter move no food: 8 segments.\n\nAfter move with food: 10 segments.\n\nIn option 2, moving L, from 9 to 8 segments temporarily? No, the snake length decreases only if no food, but it's not decreasing, it's just moving, length remains the same unless food eaten.\n\nSnake length increases only when eating food, otherwise stays the same.\n\nIn terms of segments: when no food eaten, the snake moves, so the number of segments remains the same, but the tail cell is vacated.\n\nNumber of segments: if no food eaten, number of segments unchanged, but the snake moves forward, so the tail position changes.\n\nIn the position list, the number of elements remains the same if no food, but each shifts.\n\nIf food eaten, number increases by one.\n\nInitial: 9 segments.\n\nAfter move with no food: still 9 segments, but positions updated: head new, each body to previous, tail removed and new tail from previous.\n\nIn the list, it's the same number of elements, but positions changed.\n\nFor example, after move L no food: positions [(3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)] — 9 positions, tail at (1,6).\n\nBefore: [(4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)] 9 segments.\n\nAfter: head (3,4), then (4,4) from old head, (5,4) from old seg1, (5,5) from old seg2, (4,5) from old seg3, (3,5) from old seg4, (2,5) from old seg5, (2,6) from old seg6, (1,6) from old seg7. Old seg8 (1,5) is gone, not included. So 9 segments, from index 0 to 8.\n\nSimilarly, with food, 10 segments.\n\nIn option 2, moving L, I have 9 segments, at (3,4).\n\nNow, I need to think about long-term survival and scoring.\n\nThere is food at (5,1) with short life span, only 6 turns left, so I need to eat it soon or it disappears.\n\n(4,3) has longer life span, 9 turns.\n\nBut (4,3) is very close, at (4,3), which is directly below me at (4,4).\n\nIf I don't eat it now, someone else might, but since I'm the only snake, I can eat it later, but it might be risky or I might not get it.\n\nThe food is on the grid, and I can eat it when I move there.\n\nIf I move L to (3,4), then (4,3) is still there, I can go down later.\n\nBut let's see the board.\n\nAlso, there's the obstacle at (5,6), but not relevant now.\n\nNow, let's plan multiple turns.\n\nFirst, if I move D at turn 20 to (4,3), eat food, snake to 10 segments, head at (4,3), direction D.\n\nThen from (4,3), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut direction is D, so cannot move U (reverse).\n\nAlso, walls: y=0 is bottom, so y=3, D to (4,2), which is within bounds, y=2 not wall.\n\nL to (3,3), R to (5,3), U not allowed.\n\nNow, what is around (4,3): (4,2) empty, (3,3) empty, (5,3) empty, (4,4) is snake body now.\n\nAfter moving to (4,3), positions: head (4,3), body (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), etc.\n\nSo (4,4) is occupied, so moving U to (4,4) would be collision.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) is empty, (3,3) empty, (4,2) empty.\n\nFood at (5,1) is below, at y=1.\n\nI can go down to eat it.\n\nBut life span 6, at turn 20, after eating (4,3), it's turn 21, life span of (5,1) is 5, etc.\n\nNow, if I don't eat (4,3) now, move L to (3,4) at turn 20.\n\nThen at (3,4), no food, direction L.\n\nFrom (3,4), possible moves: U to (3,5), D to (3,3), L to (2,4), R to (4,4) but R is reverse? Direction is L, so moving R is opposite, not allowed.\n\nAlso, (4,4) is now occupied by snake body? After move L, positions: head (3,4), body (4,4), (5,4), etc.\n\nSo (4,4) occupied, so cannot move R anyway.\n\nPossible: U to (3,5), D to (3,3), L to (2,4).\n\n(3,5) is in snake positions? After move, positions: [(3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)]\n\nSo (3,5) is occupied by snake body (segment 5? Let's index: head (3,4), seg1 (4,4), seg2 (5,4), seg3 (5,5), seg4 (4,5), seg5 (3,5), seg6 (2,5), seg7 (2,6), seg8 (1,6)\n\nSo (3,5) is seg5, not tail, so moving U to (3,5) would be collision.\n\nD to (3,3): empty, not wall.\n\nL to (2,4): (2,4) not in positions, should be empty.\n\nR not allowed and occupied.\n\nSo from (3,4), I can move D to (3,3) or L to (2,4).\n\nIf I move D to (3,3), no food there.\n\nOr L to (2,4), no food.\n\nThen (4,3) is still there, I can go to it later.\n\nBut (4,3) is at (4,3), which is below (4,4), but (4,4) is now body, so I need to move to (4,3) from somewhere.\n\nFor example, from (3,4), I can move D to (3,3), then from (3,3) I can move R to (4,3) to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, from (2,4) I can go down, etc.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (5,1).\n\n(5,1) is at x=5, y=1, near the bottom left? Grid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7, so (5,1) is bottom, since y=0 is bottom? The problem says \"Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\" and walls, so y=0 is the bottom wall, y=7 top, I assume.\n\n\" y=0/y=7\" so y=0 and y=7 are walls, so the playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No.\n\n\"Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\" so cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 are walls. So the grid has walls on borders, so playable cells are from (1,1) to (6,6)? x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to 6 are free? Similarly y=1 to 6.\n\nx from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so for movement, we can only be on x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, I think.\n\nFor example, (4,4) is fine, (5,1) is x=5,y=1, y=1 is not wall, y=0 is wall, so y=1 is playable.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 is playable, y=7 wall.\n\nx=0 and x=7 walls.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,6), which is playable cell but walled.\n\nSo (5,6) is wall, cannot move there.\n\nBack to (5,1): at (5,1), y=1, which is above y=0 wall.\n\nTo reach (5,1) from current position (4,4), I need to go down and right.\n\nFrom (4,4), moving D to (4,3) gets me closer, but (4,3) is not (5,1).\n\nFrom (4,3), I can go right to (5,3), then down to (5,2), then to (5,1).\n\nOr from (3,4), I can go down to (3,3), then right to (4,3) or (5,3), etc.\n\nBut if I eat (4,3) now, I grow, which might make it harder to maneuver later, but I get the point.\n\nIf I don't eat it, I can stay smaller, but I need to eat both if possible.\n\n(5,1) has only 6 turns left, so I must eat it by turn 25.\n\nTurn 20: life span 6, so on turn 20, it exists, after turn 20, on turn 21, life span 5, and so on, until turn 25, life span 1, on turn 26 it disappears. So I need to eat it on or before turn 25.\n\nSimilarly for (4,3), by turn 28.\n\nNow, let's plan a path to (5,1).\n\nFrom current head (4,4), to (5,1): I need to go down 3 steps and right 1 step, but with obstacles.\n\nShortest path: down to (4,3), then right to (5,3), then down to (5,2), then down to (5,1). That's 3 moves, but I have to consider the snake body.\n\nIf I move D to (4,3) on turn 20, I eat food, grow, at (4,3) on turn 21.\n\nThen from (4,3), I can move R to (5,3) on turn 21, no food there.\n\nThen on turn 22, move D to (5,2), no food.\n\nTurn 23, move D to (5,1), eat food.\n\nSo I can eat (5,1) on turn 23, within life span.\n\nSimilarly, if I don't eat (4,3) now, I can still go to (5,1) but it might take more turns or be riskier.\n\nFor example, move L to (3,4) on turn 20, then from (3,4) move D to (3,3) on turn 21, then R to (4,3) on turn 22 to eat (4,3), then from (4,3) move R to (5,3) on turn 23, D to (5,2) turn 24, D to (5,1) turn 25, just in time.\n\nBut on turn 25, I eat it, life span on turn 25 is 1, so it exists, I can eat.\n\nBut in this case, I eat (4,3) later and grow later.\n\nBut in the first approach, I eat (4,3) earlier and have a longer snake when going to (5,1).\n\nWith a longer snake, it might be harder to move around, especially near the border.\n\nAlso, there is the tail reward danger, but not relevant here since no food near tail.\n\nAnother thing: the snake body might block paths.\n\nLet's simulate both options.\n\nFirst option: eat (4,3) on turn 20.\n\nTurn 20: move D to (4,3), eat food, grow to 10 segments. Head at (4,3), direction D.\n\nPositions: head (4,3), then (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) — tail at (1,5).\n\n(1,5) is tail.\n\nNow turn 21: from (4,3), direction D, so cannot move U.\n\nPossible moves: D to (4,2), L to (3,3), R to (5,3).\n\n(4,2) empty, (3,3) empty, (5,3) empty.\n\nI want to go to (5,1), so moving R to (5,3) is good.\n\nMove R to (5,3), no food, so snake moves, tail moves.\n\nNew head at (5,3), then body: (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6) — tail (1,5) removed, so positions: [(5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)]? Let's list.\n\nAfter move to (5,3) no food: new head (5,3), then old head (4,3) becomes body, then old body segments: (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), and old tail (1,5) removed. Old positions had 10 segments, after no food, 10 segments but tail moved.\n\nPositions before turn 21: [(4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)]\n\nAfter move R to (5,3): new head (5,3), then seg1: old head (4,3), seg2: old seg1 (4,4), seg3: old seg2 (5,4), seg4: old seg3 (5,5), seg5: old seg4 (4,5), seg6: old seg5 (3,5), seg7: old seg6 (2,5), seg8: old seg7 (2,6), seg9: old seg8 (1,6). Old seg9 (1,5) removed. So new positions: [(5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)] 10 segments, tail at (1,6).\n\nDirection now R.\n\nTurn 22: from (5,3), direction R, so cannot move L.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,4), D to (5,2), R to (6,3), L not allowed.\n\n(5,4) is occupied by snake body? Positions: seg3 is (5,4), which is body, not tail. Tail is (1,6), far away. So (5,4) is occupied, collision if move U.\n\nR to (6,3): x=6, not wall, x=7 is wall, so (6,3) is playable, and not occupied, so possible.\n\nD to (5,2): empty, not wall.\n\nI need to go down to (5,1), so move D to (5,2).\n\nMove D to (5,2), no food, so snake moves, tail moves.\n\nNew head (5,2), then body: (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) — old tail (1,6) removed? Positions before: [(5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)]\n\nAfter move D to (5,2) no food: new head (5,2), seg1: old head (5,3), seg2: old seg1 (4,3), seg3: old seg2 (4,4), seg4: old seg3 (5,4), seg5: old seg4 (5,5), seg6: old seg5 (4,5), seg7: old seg6 (3,5), seg8: old seg7 (2,5), seg9: old seg8 (2,6). Old seg9 (1,6) removed. So positions: [(5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)] tail at (2,6).\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 23: from (5,2), direction D, cannot move U.\n\nPossible moves: D to (5,1), L to (4,2), R to (6,2).\n\n(5,1) has food, positive, so move D to (5,1), eat food, grow.\n\nNew head (5,1), then body: (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) — and since eaten, tail not removed, so new segment, positions: head (5,1), then (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) — 11 segments, tail at (2,6).\n\nDirection D.\n\nNow I have eaten both foods, score 2.\n\nBut I need to think about survival after that.\n\nNow, second option: at turn 20, move L to (3,4) instead.\n\nTurn 20: move L to (3,4), no food, positions: [(3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)] tail at (1,6).\n\nDirection L.\n\nTurn 21: from (3,4), direction L, cannot move R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,5), D to (3,3), L to (2,4).\n\nBut (3,5) is occupied by snake body (seg5, (3,5)), collision.\n\nSo only D to (3,3) or L to (2,4).\n\n(3,3) empty, (2,4) empty.\n\nI want to go to (4,3) or (5,1).\n\nIf I move D to (3,3), then from there I can move R to (4,3) to eat.\n\nOr move L to (2,4), then down, but (4,3) is closer via (3,3).\n\nSo move D to (3,3) on turn 21.\n\nMove to (3,3), no food, positions update: new head (3,3), then body (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) — tail (1,6) removed? Positions before: [(3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)]\n\nAfter move D to (3,3) no food: new head (3,3), seg1: old head (3,4), seg2: old seg1 (4,4), seg3: old seg2 (5,4), seg4: old seg3 (5,5), seg5: old seg4 (4,5), seg6: old seg5 (3,5), seg7: old seg6 (2,5), seg8: old seg7 (2,6). Old seg8 (1,6) removed. So positions: [(3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)] 9 segments, tail at (2,6).\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 22: from (3,3), direction D, cannot move U.\n\nPossible moves: D to (3,2), L to (2,3), R to (4,3).\n\n(4,3) has food, so I can move R to (4,3) to eat.\n\nMove R to (4,3), eat food, grow.\n\nNew head (4,3), then body: (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) — tail not removed, so positions: head (4,3), then (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) — 10 segments.\n\nDirection R.\n\nNow turn 23: from (4,3), direction R, cannot move L.\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,4), D to (4,2), R to (5,3).\n\n(4,4) is occupied by snake body (seg4? Positions: head (4,3), seg1 (3,3), seg2 (3,4), seg3 (4,4), so (4,4) is seg3, body, collision if move U.\n\nD to (4,2) empty.\n\nR to (5,3) empty.\n\nI need to go to (5,1), so move R to (5,3).\n\nMove to (5,3), no food, positions update: new head (5,3), then body (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) — tail (2,6) removed?

Old seg9 (2,6) removed. So positions: [(5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)] tail at (2,5).\n\nDirection R.\n\nTurn 24: from (5,3), direction R, cannot move L.\n\nMoves: U to (5,4), D to (5,2), R to (6,3).\n\n(5,4) is occupied by seg5? Positions: seg5 is (5,4), body, collision.\n\nR to (6,3) empty.\n\nD to (5,2) empty.\n\nMove D to (5,2), no food.\n\nNew head (5,2), body: (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) — tail (2,5) removed? Before: [(5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nAfter move D to (5,2) no food: new head (5,2), seg1: old head (5,3), seg2: old seg1 (4,3), seg3: old seg2 (3,3), seg4: old seg3 (3,4), seg5: old seg4 (4,4), seg6: old seg5 (5,4), seg7: old seg6 (5,5), seg8: old seg7 (4,5), seg9: old seg8 (3,5). Old seg9 (2,5) removed. Positions: [(5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)] tail at (3,5).\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 25: from (5,2), direction D, cannot move U.\n\nMoves: D to (5,1), L to (4,2), R to (6,2).\n\n(5,1) has food, move D to (5,1), eat, grow.\n\nNew head (5,1), then body: (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) — tail not removed, so 11 segments.\n\nDirection D.\n\nIn both cases, I can eat both foods by turn 23 or 25.\n\nIn the first option, I eat both by turn 23 with a longer snake earlier.\n\nIn the second, I eat (4,3) on turn 22 and (5,1) on turn 25.\n\nBut in terms of risk, in the first option, when I go to (5,3) and (5,2), the body is around, but I didn't have issues.\n\nIn the second option, when I move to (4,3) on turn 22, the snake is smaller initially.\n\nBut after eating both, the snake is long, 11 segments.\n\nNow, after eating, I need to survive, but since no more food, I just need to avoid dying.\n\nBut the game continues, I assume, and more food may spawn, but not specified, so I need to survive long-term.\n\nIn the current state, only two foods, so after eating, I should find a safe path.\n\nBut for now, since I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the problem doesn't specify how many turns to output, just \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and output in the format with actions.\n\nThe answer format is to output a sequence of actions starting from turn t1.\n\nBut it doesn't say how many turns, so I should output until I eat the foods or something.\n\nPerhaps I should output a few turns to reach a safe state.\n\nBut let's see the immediate decision.\n\nAnother thing: in the first option, when I move to (5,2) on turn 22, the position (5,4) is occupied, but I moved down, not into it.\n\nIn the second option, when I go to (4,3) on turn 22, from (3,3), moving R to (4,3), but (4,4) is body, but I move to (4,3), which was empty except for food.\n\nNow, comparing the two: if I eat (4,3) on turn 20, I get the point earlier, and I'm closer to (5,1), eating it on turn 23.\n\nIf I move away, I eat (4,3) later on turn 22, and (5,1) on turn 25, just before it disappears.\n\nBut in the first case, I eat (5,1) with 3 turns to spare (life span 3 on turn 23? On turn 20, life span 6, turn 21:5, turn22:4, turn23:3, so I eat when life span 3, fine.\n\nIn second, eat on turn25 when life span 1, also fine.\n\nBut perhaps eating earlier is better in case something happens.\n\nAlso, with a longer snake, it might be riskier near the border.\n\nFor example, at (5,1), y=1, close to wall y=0.\n\nAfter eating (5,1), head at (5,1), direction D, but y=1, D to (5,0) is wall, dead, so I cannot move down.\n\nSimilarly, if I am at (5,1), I can only move left, right, or up, not down.\n\nIn both cases, after eating (5,1), I am at (5,1) with direction D, but D is invalid, so I need to change direction.\n\nIn the first option, after turn 23, head at (5,1), direction D, but (5,0) is wall, so I cannot move D.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,2), but (5,2) is snake body? After eating (5,1), positions: head (5,1), then (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), etc. (5,2) is occupied, so moving U to (5,2) collision.\n\nL to (4,1), or R to (6,1).\n\n(4,1) and (6,1) may be empty.\n\nSimilarly, in the second option same thing.\n\nBut let's not go too far.\n\nFor turn 20 decision, moving D to eat (4,3) seems fine, and I can reach (5,1) safely.\n\nIf I move L to (3,4), I avoid growing immediately, which might give more space, but in this case, the board has space, and (4,3) is easy to eat later.\n\nBut moving L might be safer for long-term if I want to avoid being trapped.\n\nBut let's see the tail position.\n\nIn the first option, after moving to (5,3) etc., the tail is at (2,6), which is not near.\n\nAnother risk: the food at (4,3) might be eaten by me in both cases, but if I don't eat it now, and something happens, I might not get it, but unlikely.\n\nBut since I'm the only one, I can get it later.\n\nBut the life span is long, 9 turns, so plenty of time.\n\n(5,1) has shorter life, so I should prioritize it.\n\nBy moving D to (4,3), I get closer to (5,1) faster.\n\nFrom (4,3), I can go directly to (5,3), etc.\n\nIf I move L to (3,4), I go away from (5,1), and it takes more turns to reach.\n\nFor example, from (3,4) to (5,1): need to go down and right, but with body.\n\nIn the path I took, I went to (3,3) then (4,3), adding turns.\n\nSo moving D directly is more efficient for getting to (5,1).\n\nMoreover, in terms of score, I get the +1 earlier by eating (4,3) on turn 20.\n\nThe score is the same, but I have the point earlier.\n\nBut the game might continue, so not critical.\n\nBut thinking long-term survival: after eating both, I have a long snake, 11 segments, in a 6x6 playable area? x=1-6, y=1-6, 6x6=36 cells, snake 11, so space, but near borders.\n\nFor example, at (5,1), after eating, I need to move left or right.\n\nSay move L to (4,1) or R to (6,1).\n\nThen I can go up or something.\n\nBut not immediate issue.\n\nNow, another thing: the internal obstacle at (5,6), which might block, but not relevant for now.\n\nI think moving D to eat (4,3) on turn 20 is better.\n\nBut let's confirm if moving to (4,3) is safe.\n\n(4,3) has food, and I move down to it.\n\nAfter that, as above.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if there is any danger in moving down.\n\nFor example, if I move down to (4,3), and the cell is safe, no issue.\n\nThen I can proceed.\n\nIn the second option, when I move L to (3,4), then to (3,3), then to (4,3), I might have more options later, but I think it's slower.\n\nMoreover, in the first option, I eat (4,3) immediately, so it's gone, and I don't have to worry about it.\n\nBut since it's positive, eating it is good.\n\nI think D is better.\n\nBut the problem says \"prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards\", but here both options seem safe, but moving D gets immediate reward and positions me better for the other food.\n\nAlso, for thinking 5 turns ahead: from turn 20 to 25.\n\nIn 5 turns, I can eat both foods in the first approach: turn 20: eat (4,3), turn 23: eat (5,1).\n\nIn second, turn 20: no eat, turn 22: eat (4,3), turn 25: eat (5,1).\n\nSo in 5 turns, I get one or two foods.\n\nFrom turn 20 to 24 is 5 turns ahead? Turn 20, 21,22,23,24,25 is 6 turns.\n\nBut anyway.\n\nPerhaps output actions for a few turns.\n\nBut I need to output the sequence starting from turn 20.\n\nSince the food at (5,1) must be eaten, and moving D helps, I think move D on turn 20.\n\nThen subsequent moves as above.\n\nBut I need to specify multiple actions.\n\nThe answer format is to output actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but not specified how many.\n\nPerhaps I can output until I eat (5,1) or for 5 turns.\n\nTo be safe, I'll output for turn 20 to 23 or so.\n\nFirst, let's decide turn 20 action.\n\nI think move D to (4,3) is better.\n\nThen turn 21: from (4,3), move R to (5,3)\n\nTurn 22: from (5,3), move D to (5,2)\n\nTurn 23: from (5,2), move D to (5,1) to eat.\n\nThen I can stop or continue.\n\nBut after turn 23, I need to move away from (5,1).\n\nFor example, on turn 24, from (5,1), cannot move D (wall), cannot move U (to (5,2) which is body), so must move L to (4,1) or R to (6,1).\n\nSay, move L to (4,1), etc.\n\nBut I don't need to output that far.\n\nSince the answer should be a sequence, and think ahead, I'll output for turn 20 to 24 or 25.\n\nBut let's see the format.\n\n\"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action ... }\"\n\nFor example, \"Turn 20: D, Turn 21: R, Turn 22: D, Turn 23: D\"\n\nBut on turn 23 I eat (5,1), so that's fine.\n\nIf I move L on turn 20, then actions would be different.\n\nBut I think D is better.\n\nAnother consideration: tail reward danger.\n\nIs there food near tail?\n\nTail is at (1,5), food at (5,1) and (4,3), not adjacent, so no issue.\n\nAlso, food not under body.\n\nSo I think moving D is fine.\n\nTherefore, for turn 20, action D.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, as planned.\n\nTo be thorough, let's list the actions.\n\nTurn 20: Move D to (4,3) eat food.\n\nThen turn 21: From (4,3), direction D, move R to (5,3) no food.\n\nTurn 22: From (5,3), direction R, move D to (5,2) no food.\n\nTurn 23: From (5,2), direction D, move D to (5,1) eat food.\n\nNow, after that, on turn 24, from (5,1), direction D, but cannot move D (wall), cannot move U to (5,2) (body), so must move L or R.\n\nSay, move L to (4,1) or R to (6,1).\n\n(4,1) may be empty, or (6,1).\n\nBut I need to check if safe.\n\nAfter turn 23, positions: head (5,1), body (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) — tail at (2,6)? Earlier.\n\nAfter eating (5,1) on turn 23, positions: head (5,1), then (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) — 11 segments.\n\nSo (4,1) is empty, (6,1) empty.\n\nMove L to (4,1) or R to (6,1).\n\nSay move L to (4,1) on turn 24.\n\nThen from there, etc.\n\nBut for the sequence, I can output up to turn 23 or 24.\n\nSince the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", and from turn 20, 5 turns ahead is to turn 25.\n\nBut on turn 25, if I output actions.\n\nIn my plan, by turn 23 I have eaten both.\n\nBut to show survival, I can add a move.\n\nSince the format might expect multiple turns, I'll output turn 20 to 24.\n\nTurn 20: D\n\nTurn 21: R\n\nTurn 22: D\n\nTurn 23: D\n\nTurn 24: say L to (4,1)\n\nBut need to specify.\n\nPerhaps for turn 24, from (5,1), move L to (4,1).\n\nThen direction L.\n\nBut I think it's fine.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nAnother thing: in turn 22, when I move D to (5,2), is there any risk? (5,2) is empty, fine.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think it's ok.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\nTurn 20: D\n\nTurn 21: R\n\nTurn 22: D\n\nTurn 23: D\n\nAnd if needed, Turn 24: L (to (4,1))\n\nBut since the snake is long, I need to avoid colliding.\n\nBut on turn 24, moving to (4,1) should be safe.\n\n(4,1) is not occupied.\n\nThen from there, I can go up or left, etc.\n\nBut I think for the sequence, up to turn 23 is sufficient to show I eat both foods.\n\nSince the food at (4,3) is eaten on turn 20, and (5,1) on turn 23.\n\nIn the second food, life span 9, eaten on turn 20, fine.\n\n(5,1) life span 6, eaten on turn 23, life span on turn 23 is 3, fine.\n\nSo I think this plan is good.\n\nTherefore, actions:\n\nTurn 20: D\n\nTurn 21: R\n\nTurn 22: D\n\nTurn 23: D\n\nNow, for the boxed answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned a sequence of moves at least 5 turns ahead (turns 20 to 24). The key objectives are:\n- Eat the positive food at (4,3) immediately to gain a point and increase length, positioning the snake closer to the other food at (5,1).\n- Prioritize eating (5,1) before it disappears (life span 6, so must be eaten by turn 25).\n- Avoid collisions with walls, obstacles, and the snake's body.\n- Consider the \"no instant reverse\" rule when changing direction.\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 20)\n- **Snake head**: (4,4), direction L (left).\n- **Possible moves from (4,4)**:\n  - **U (up) to (4,5)**: Occupied by body segment (index 3), collision—invalid.\n  - **D (down) to (4,3)**: Contains positive food (+1, length +1), safe and beneficial.\n  - **L (left) to (3,4)**: Empty, safe but no immediate reward.\n  - **R (right) to (5,4)**: Occupied by body segment (index 1), collision, and reverse direction from L—invalid.\n- **Food priorities**:\n  - (4,3): Life span 9, can be eaten later but is easily accessible now.\n  - (5,1): Life span 6, must be eaten within 6 turns (by turn 25); moving down now brings the snake closer.\n- **Long-term consideration**: Eating (4,3) on turn 20 provides an immediate point and growth, making the path to (5,1) shorter (3 moves vs. 5+ in alternative paths). The snake grows to 10 segments, but the grid (6x6 playable area) has sufficient space for maneuvering. Avoiding (4,3) now delays growth and risks missing (5,1) due to tighter time constraints.\n\n### Planned Move Sequence (Turns 20-24)\nThe sequence ensures both foods are eaten safely by turn 23, with turn 24 focusing on survival:\n- **Turn 20 (t=20)**: Move **D (down)** to (4,3) to eat the positive food. This increases length to 10, scores +1, and sets direction to D. (Life span of (4,3) decreases to 8 after this turn.)\n- **Turn 21 (t=21)**: From (4,3), direction D. Move **R (right)** to (5,3). No food, so snake moves normally (tail segment removed). Direction set to R. (Life span of (5,1) decreases to 5.)\n- **Turn 22 (t=22)**: From (5,3), direction R. Move **D (down)** to (5,2). No food, snake moves normally. Direction set to D. (Life span of (5,1) decreases to 4.)\n- **Turn 23 (t=23)**: From (5,2), direction D. Move **D (down)** to (5,1) to eat the positive food. This increases length to 11, scores +1. Direction remains D. (Life span of (5,1) was 4; eaten before disappearing.)\n- **Turn 24 (t=24)**: From (5,1), direction D. Cannot move D (y=0 wall) or U (to (5,2), occupied by body). Move **L (left)** to (4,1) to avoid collision and open space for movement. Direction set to L. This ensures survival and prepares for future food spawns.\n\n### Why This Sequence?\n- **Efficiency**: Eats both foods by turn 23, scoring +2 and maximizing points early. The path to (5,1) is direct and minimizes turns.\n- **Safety**: All moves avoid collisions:\n  - No wall issues: (4,3), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), and (4,1) are within bounds (x=1-6, y=1-6).\n  - No body collisions: Each target cell is empty or food when moved to, and the tail moves away as needed.\n  - Direction changes respect \"no instant reverse\" (e.g., from D to R on turn 21 is allowed).\n- **Life Span Management**: (5,1) is eaten on turn 23 with 3 life span remaining (safe margin). (4,3) is eaten immediately.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: After eating, moving to (4,1) on turn 24 avoids the bottom wall and body, giving space to navigate. The snake is now centered, reducing border risks for future turns.\n\nThis plan achieves the highest score possible with the available food while prioritizing survival through cautious, forward-looking moves.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 20: D\nTurn 21: R\nTurn 22: D\nTurn 23: D\nTurn 24: L\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 21. The grid has walls: border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (4,3), and the body segments follow: (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5). So the head is at (4,3), and the tail is at (1,5). Head direction is Down, which is (x,y-1), so moving down decreases y.\n\nFood: there's one food at (5,1) with value 1 and life span 5. Since it's turn 21, this food will disappear after 5 turns, so at turn 26. Life span decreases every turn, including current, so after turn 21, it has 4 turns left? Let me clarify: life span N means it disappears after N turns from now. So at turn 21, with life span 5, it will be there for turns 21,22,23,24,25, and disappear at turn 26. So on turn 21, it has 5 turns left including this one; after turn 21, it has 4 left, and so on.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for the next 5+ turns. The goal is to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I should think long-term, not just immediate rewards.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid to visualize. Grid size: 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls: all borders and (5,6).\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- Head: (4,3)\n\n- Body: (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)\n\nSince head is at (4,3) and direction is Down, which is decreasing y, so it was moving down to (4,3) from (4,4)? Positions are listed head first, so from head to tail: (4,3) -> (4,4) -> (5,4) -> (5,5) -> (4,5) -> (3,5) -> (2,5) -> (2,6) -> (1,6) -> (1,5)\n\n(1,5) is the tail. Now, head direction is D, so it's facing down.\n\nPossible moves: Since direction is Down, I can move Down, Left, or Right. Cannot move Up because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. Rule: no instant reverse, so from Down, I cannot go Up immediately.\n\nSo actions possible: D (continue down), L (left), R (right).\n\nNow, let's see the current position: head at (4,3). Moving:\n\n- Down (D): to (4,2)\n\n- Left (L): to (3,3)\n\n- Right (R): to (5,3)\n\nNow, check for collisions:\n\nFirst, walls: borders are walls, so y=0 is wall, but (4,2) is y=2, not 0, so ok. x=0 and x=7 are walls, but (3,3) x=3>0, (5,3) x=5<7, so all possible moves are within bounds, no wall collision yet.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,6), which is not in the path for immediate moves.\n\nNow, body collision: need to see if moving to a cell occupied by body except tail.\n\nSnake body segments: (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)\n\nMoving to (4,2): is (4,2) in body? Current body: (4,4), (5,4), etc. (4,2) is not in the list, so safe.\n\n(3,3): not in body positions.\n\n(5,3): not in body positions.\n\nAlso, tail is at (1,5), far away.\n\nBut there's a rule about tail: if head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it could kill, but here no food mentioned on tail, and tail is not adjacent to head. Head at (4,3), tail at (1,5), distance is |4-1| + |3-5| = 3 + 2 = 5, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so up, down, left, right.\n\nSo all three moves are safe immediately.\n\nBut I need to think about the food. Food at (5,1) with value +1. I should try to eat it.\n\n(5,1) is at x=5, y=1. Head is at (4,3), so to reach (5,1), I need to go right and down.\n\nCurrently at (4,3), (5,1) is two steps right and two steps down? From (4,3) to (5,1): delta x=1, delta y=-2, so need to move right and down twice.\n\nBut I have to move one step at a time.\n\nAlso, life span: food has life span 5, starting turn 21, so it will be gone after turn 25, meaning on turn 26 it's gone. So I have until turn 25 to eat it.\n\nNow, to eat it, I need to move head to (5,1).\n\nBut let's see the path. Also, I need to consider the snake body and obstacles.\n\nFirst, from (4,3), if I move right to (5,3), that's one step closer.\n\nThen from (5,3), I can move down to (5,2), then down to (5,1).\n\n(5,2) and (5,1) need to be safe.\n\nCurrently, body positions: let's list all occupied cells: (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)\n\n(5,2) is not occupied, (5,1) is not occupied, so should be fine.\n\nBut when I move, the snake moves, so the body changes.\n\nAlso, after eating, the snake grows, so length increases.\n\nNow, let's simulate a few moves.\n\nBut I need to plan for multiple turns.\n\nFirst, I should consider if there are any risks near the food or on the way.\n\nFor example, at (5,1), is there any danger?\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (5,6), but that's not near (5,1).\n\n(5,1) is near the bottom wall, y=0.\n\ny=0 is wall, so (5,1) is one above wall, so moving down to (5,0) would be wall, but I don't need to go there.\n\nNow, after eating at (5,1), the snake grows, so I need to be careful not to trap myself.\n\nBut let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, for turn 21, I need to choose an action.\n\nOptions: D, L, R.\n\nIf I go R to (5,3), that gets me closer to food at (5,1).\n\nIf I go D to (4,2), that's away from food.\n\nL to (3,3) also away.\n\nBut going towards food might be good, but I need to ensure I can reach it and not die.\n\nAlso, I should consider the tail position.\n\nTail is at (1,5), and as the snake moves, the tail will move, so paths might open up.\n\nCurrently, the snake is long, 10 segments.\n\nAfter moving, the tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail might be free.\n\nFor example, if I move in any direction, the head moves, and the tail moves, so (1,5) is vacated, but the new tail is (1,6) or something.\n\nLet's think about snake movement.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the head goes to a new cell, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it. The tail is removed, so the cell that was tail is free, unless food is there or something, but in general, the tail cell is freed.\n\nIn this case, current tail is (1,5). When snake moves, head goes to new position, say (4,2) if D, then the segment that was at (4,4) moves to (4,3), (5,4) moves to (4,4), and so on, down to (1,6) moves to (2,6), and (1,5) is no longer part of snake, so (1,5) is free.\n\nSimilarly for other moves.\n\nBut (1,5) is not near the head, so immediate freedom doesn't affect head movement.\n\nNow back to food: (5,1) is at bottom, head at (4,3), so I can go right then down down.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach it in time.\n\nFrom (4,3) to (5,1): minimum 2 moves: e.g., R then D D, or D then R D, etc.\n\nBut after moving, positions change.\n\nAlso, life span: food available until turn 25 inclusive? Let's clarify life span.\n\nFood has life span N, appears for N turns including the current turn when it is present. So at turn 21, life span 5, it will be there for turn 21,22,23,24,25. After turn 25, it disappears, so on turn 26 it's gone.\n\nI need to eat it on or before turn 25.\n\nTurn 21: food present, life span 5\n\nAfter turn 21: life span decreases to 4\n\nTurn 22: life span 3? No.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current, but the countdown is for how many turns it remains.\n\nTypically: at turn t, if food has life span L, it will disappear after L turns, so it is present from turn t to turn t+L-1 inclusive.\n\nFor example, L=5 at turn 21: present on turns 21,22,23,24,25. Disappears at turn 26.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I have until turn 25 to eat it.\n\nNow, from turn 21, I can reach (5,1) in 2 moves: e.g., on turn 21 move to (5,3), then turn 22 move to (5,2), turn 23 move to (5,1) to eat.\n\n(5,1) is the target, so on turn 23, if I move to (5,1), I eat it.\n\nTurn 21: at (4,3)\n\nTurn 21 move: say R to (5,3)\n\nThen turn 22: from (5,3), I can move D to (5,2)\n\nThen turn 23: move D to (5,1) and eat.\n\nSince life span 5, on turn 23 it should be there, as turn 23 is within 21 to 25.\n\nTurn 21,22,23,24,25: yes, 5 turns.\n\nSo eating on turn 23 is fine.\n\nBut I need to make sure that on turn 22, (5,2) is safe, and on turn 23, (5,1) is safe.\n\nNow, when I move, the snake body changes.\n\nLet me simulate the moves.\n\nCurrent state turn 21:\n\nHead: (4,3), dir D\n\nBody: [(4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5)]\n\nAfter move R to (5,3) on turn 21:\n\nNew head: (5,3)\n\nNew body: the first body segment moves to previous head position (4,3), then next to previous first body, and so on.\n\nSo new positions: head (5,3), then (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)\n\nThe tail (1,5) is removed, so (1,5) free.\n\nNow, (1,6) is still part of snake, but it's the new tail.\n\nNow, on turn 22, from head at (5,3), direction: since I moved right, previous dir was D, but now I moved R, so new head direction is R.\n\nI need to track direction for no instant reverse.\n\nOn turn 21, head dir was D, I moved R, so now dir is R.\n\nPossible moves: from (5,3), dir R, so I can move R, U, D. Cannot move L (opposite of R).\n\nI want to move D to (5,2) to go towards food.\n\n(5,2): is it safe?\n\nCurrent positions: snake occupies (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)\n\n(5,2) is not occupied, and not wall (y=2>0), so safe.\n\nMove D to (5,2).\n\nThen turn 22: head at (5,2), body: (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6) — but (1,6) is tail, after move, it moves.\n\nAfter move D to (5,2):\n\nNew head: (5,2)\n\nNew body: previous head (5,3), then (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)\n\n(1,6) is removed, so free.\n\nNow, head at (5,2), dir: since I moved D from (5,3), and previous dir was R? On turn 22, before move, head was at (5,3), and I moved D, so new dir is D.\n\nNow turn 23: move D to (5,1) to eat food.\n\n(5,1) has food, value +1, so I eat it, snake grows, so length increases by 1.\n\nAfter eating, when I move to (5,1), I consume the food, and the snake grows, so the tail does not move; instead, a new segment is added at the tail position, so the snake becomes longer.\n\nRule: when eating positive food, length +1, so tail doesn't move, new segment is added.\n\nSo on turn 23, move to (5,1):\n\nNew head: (5,1)\n\nSince eating, the body: previous head (5,2) becomes first body, then (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), and tail (1,6) remains, but since growing, we add a new segment at tail, so the tail stays at (1,6), and new positions: head (5,1), then (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), and (1,6) with new segment? Let's think.\n\nWhen the head moves to a food cell, it eats it, and the tail does not move, so the snake gains a segment. The new segment is added at the position where the tail was, but since tail doesn't move, it stays, and the body extends.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat, you move to the food cell, but the tail doesn't advance, so the snake grows by one cell.\n\nIn terms of positions: after moving head to food, the body segments shift as usual, but since eating, we don't remove the tail, so the tail position remains, and we have an extra segment.\n\nFor example, before move, positions: [head, body..., tail]\n\nAfter moving to food: new head at food cell, then the previous head becomes first body, and so on, down to tail, and since eating, tail is not removed, so we have the same tail position, and the new segment is effectively added where the tail was, but it's the tail itself not moving.\n\nSo length increases by one.\n\nIn this case, before turn 23 move: positions at end of turn 22: head (5,2), body: (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) — that's 10 segments? Let's count.\n\nTurn 22 after move: head (5,2), then body: (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) — that's 9 body segments, plus head, 10 total. Tail is (2,6).\n\nAfter move to (5,1) and eat:\n\nNew head: (5,1)\n\nThen body: (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) — and since eating, no tail removed, so (2,6) remains as part of body, and we have 11 segments now.\n\nThe positions are: head (5,1), then segments: (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) — so (2,6) is the last body segment, which was tail before.\n\nNow, (2,6) is occupied, and head is at (5,1), far away.\n\nNow, after eating, I have the food, score +1.\n\nBut now I need to think about survival. I'm at (5,1), near the bottom wall.\n\nPossible moves from (5,1): since dir is D (from moving down), so I can move D, L, R. Cannot move U (up).\n\nBut D to (5,0) is wall, y=0, so cannot move down.\n\nSo only L to (4,1) or R to (6,1).\n\nx=6? But walls: border x=7 and x=0, so x=6 is not wall, since x=7 is wall, so x from 0 to 7, (6,1) is valid, x=6<7.\n\nx=7 is wall, so x=6 is ok.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) ok.\n\nInternal obstacle (5,6) not relevant.\n\nNow, (4,1) and (6,1) need to be safe.\n\nCurrent snake positions: (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)\n\n(4,1) is not occupied, (6,1) not occupied.\n\nBut (4,1) might be ok, but let's see what's around.\n\nFrom (5,1), if I move L to (4,1), or R to (6,1).\n\nBut after that, I need to find a way to survive, not get trapped.\n\nSince I'm near the bottom, and snake is long, I might need to go up or something.\n\nBut let's think beyond just getting the food.\n\nIn this plan, I eat on turn 23, which is fine.\n\nBut is there any risk?\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (5,6), which might affect later movement.\n\nAlso, the tail is at (2,6), which is near the obstacle or borders.\n\nBut for now, getting the food seems straightforward.\n\nBut the problem says to think 5+ turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival.\n\nAfter eating at (5,1), I'm in a corner, and the snake body is above me, so I might be trapping myself.\n\nFor example, if I go to (5,1), then I can only go left or right.\n\nSuppose I go left to (4,1), then from there, I can go U to (4,2), but (4,2) might be occupied or not.\n\nAfter moving to (4,1), let's see positions.\n\nBut I need to plan multiple moves.\n\nPerhaps there is a better way to approach the food or consider not going directly if it risks death.\n\nBut in this case, going to (5,1) seems ok, and then I can move left or right to safety.\n\nSince the grid is small, I should map out the free cells.\n\nFirst, list all occupied cells by snake and walls.\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (5,6).\n\nSo walls: (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7), and (5,6).\n\nSnake: (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) — 10 cells.\n\nGrid size 8x8 = 64 cells, walls: borders have how many? Top row y=7: 8 cells, bottom y=0: 8, left x=0: but corners shared, so better not double count.\n\nTotal wall cells: top row: (x,7) for x=0 to7: 8 cells\n\nBottom row: (x,0) for x=0 to7: 8 cells\n\nLeft column: (0,y) for y=1 to6: 6 cells (since y=0 and y=7 already counted)\n\nRight column: (7,y) for y=1 to6: 6 cells\n\nPlus internal (5,6): 1 cell\n\nTotal walls: 8 (top) + 8 (bottom) + 6 (left no corners) + 6 (right no corners) + 1 internal = 29 walls? That can't be right.\n\n8x8 grid has 64 cells.\n\nBorders: all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7.\n\nx=0: y=0 to7, 8 cells\n\nx=7: y=0 to7, 8 cells\n\ny=0: x=1 to6, since x=0 and x=7 already included, so 6 cells\n\ny=7: x=1 to6, 6 cells\n\nSo total border walls: 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28 cells\n\nPlus internal obstacle (5,6): 1 cell, total 29 walls.\n\nSnake: 10 cells.\n\nFree cells: 64 - 29 - 10 = 25 free cells? 64-29=35, minus 10 snake, 25 free.\n\nBut food at (5,1), which is free now.\n\nAfter I eat, snake becomes 11 cells, free cells decrease.\n\nBut I need to survive.\n\nBack to the plan.\n\nIf I go to (5,1) and eat, then at (5,1), I can move L to (4,1) or R to (6,1).\n\nSuppose I move L to (4,1), then from there, I can go U to (4,2) or L to (3,1) or D, but D to (4,0) wall, so only U or L.\n\nSimilarly, if I go R to (6,1), then U to (6,2) or R to (7,1) but x=7 wall, so only U.\n\n(6,1) to (7,1) is x=7 wall, cannot, so from (6,1) can go U to (6,2) or L to (5,1) but (5,1) is body now, so only U to (6,2).\n\nSimilarly from (4,1), can go U to (4,2) or L to (3,1).\n\nNow, let's see if I can find a path to open space.\n\nFor example, after eating at (5,1), if I go to (4,1), then to (4,2), etc.\n\nBut (4,2) might be free.\n\nIn my earlier simulation, after turn 22, positions include (5,2), (5,3), etc., but (4,2) is not occupied, I think.\n\nAfter turn 23 eating at (5,1), positions: (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)\n\nSo (4,2) is free, (3,2), (4,1), etc.\n\nFrom (5,1), if I go L to (4,1), then U to (4,2), then from (4,2) I can go U to (4,3), but (4,3) is occupied by body! (4,3) is the third body segment in the list: after head (5,1), then (5,2), (5,3), then (4,3), so (4,3) is occupied.\n\nAt (4,2), if I move U to (4,3), it is occupied, so body collision.\n\nSimilarly, from (4,2) I can go L to (3,2) or R to (5,2), but (5,2) is body, occupied.\n\nSo only L to (3,2) or D to (4,1), but D is back.\n\n(3,2) is free, I think.\n\nList free cells: occupied: snake and walls.\n\nWalls: all border except list, but easier to think per cell.\n\n(4,2): not in snake positions above, not wall, so free.\n\n(3,2): similarly free.\n\n(4,1): free.\n\nFrom (4,1), after moving there from (5,1), positions: head at (4,1), body: (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), etc.\n\nNow from (4,1), I can go U to (4,2) or L to (3,1).\n\n(4,2) is free, so go U to (4,2).\n\nThen from (4,2), possible moves: U to (4,3), but (4,3) is occupied by body (as above, (4,3) is part of body).\n\nD to (4,1) but occupied now.\n\nL to (3,2), or R to (5,2) but (5,2) occupied.\n\nSo only L to (3,2).\n\nGo to (3,2).\n\nThen from (3,2), can go U to (3,3), L to (2,2), D to (3,1), R to (4,2) but occupied.\n\n(3,3) : is it free? Snake has (4,3), (5,3), etc., not (3,3), so free.\n\nU to (3,3).\n\nThen from (3,3), and so on.\n\nI can gradually move left and up to open area.\n\nSimilarly, if I had gone right from (5,1), to (6,1), then U to (6,2), etc.\n\n(6,2) might be free.\n\nIn the body, we have positions up to (5,5), (4,5), etc., but (6,2) not occupied.\n\nSo it seems possible to escape to the left or right.\n\nBut let's see the grid.\n\nThe snake body is mostly on the right and center, so going left might be better to open space.\n\nFor example, (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (1,5) are occupied, but as we move, the tail moves, freeing cells.\n\nIn the long run, I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nBut for now, eating the food seems achievable and not immediately dangerous.\n\nBut is there a reason not to eat it? It's the only food, and positive, so I should eat it.\n\nThe problem says \"maximize score\", and this is +1, so I should take it.\n\nBut think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nAfter eating, I have a longer snake, which might be harder to maneuver, but since grid has free space, it should be ok.\n\nPerhaps I can plan a path that eats the food and continues safely.\n\nAnother thing: the tail reward danger, but not applicable here since tail not adjacent.\n\nAlso, food under body: but (5,1) is not under body, it's free.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, for turn 21, moving right to (5,3) is good to approach food.\n\nBut I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe answer format is to list actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but output the actions for the sequence starting from t1.\n\nBut I don't have to output all 5, just the sequence for the immediate turns, but since I'm planning, I should specify for a few turns.\n\nThe format says: \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I need to list for several turns.\n\nBut how many? It doesn't specify, but since I think 5+ ahead, I should output at least 5 actions? But that might be rigid.\n\nI should output the actions until I eat the food or something.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nPerhaps I can output a sequence.\n\nSince the food is the only objective, I can go for it directly.\n\nBut after that, I need to survive, so I should have a plan.\n\nAnother consideration: the life span is 5, so I have time, but I should eat it as soon as possible to free up for other food, but no other food mentioned, only one food.\n\nIn the state, only one food is given.\n\nSo only this food.\n\nI should eat it within the life span.\n\nWith my plan, I eat on turn 23.\n\nIf I don't go directly, I might miss it or something.\n\nBut let's see if there is a better path.\n\nFor example, from (4,3), I could go down to (4,2), but that delays going to food.\n\n(4,2) is safe, but then from there, to reach (5,1), I need to go right then down, or down then right, but (4,1) or (5,2).\n\nBut it takes more turns.\n\nFor example, turn 21 D to (4,2), then turn 22 R to (5,2), then turn 23 D to (5,1) eat.\n\nSame as before, but I start by going down instead of right.\n\nBut in terms of turns, same: eat on turn 23.\n\nBut going down first might not be better.\n\nFrom (4,2), if I go down to (4,1), then to (5,1), but (4,1) to (5,1) is right, but from (4,2) I can go directly right to (5,2) then down.\n\nBut same.\n\nBut in my first plan, going right first, I end up at (5,3) which is closer to the top, but after moving down, I'm at bottom.\n\nNo big difference.\n\nBut in terms of direction, after going right, head dir is R, then down, dir D.\n\nIn the other, down then right.\n\nBut for survival, after eating at bottom, I need to move away.\n\nPerhaps I can eat the food later to have more space, but why delay?\n\nUnless there is risk.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (5,6), which might block paths, but not near here.\n\nAlso, the tail is at (1,5), which might move.\n\nBut I think going for the food now is fine.\n\nBut let's confirm the move on turn 21.\n\nHead at (4,3), dir D.\n\nPossible moves: D, L, R.\n\nIf I go R to (5,3), as above.\n\nIf I go L to (3,3), that is away from food, and I might not reach food in time if I delay.\n\nFor example, from (3,3), to (5,1) is farther, need more moves, say (3,3) to (4,3) but occupied, or (3,3) to (3,2), then (4,2), etc., longer path.\n\nMinimum moves: from (3,3) to (5,1) is at least 3 moves, e.g., to (4,3) but might be occupied, or (3,2) to (4,2) to (5,2) to (5,1), 3 moves, so on turn 24, but food available until turn 25, so still possible, but riskier if something blocks.\n\nWhereas going directly, I can eat on turn 23.\n\nSimilarly, going down to (4,2) then to food, same as first plan.\n\nSo best to go towards food.\n\nNow, between R and D, both can lead to food in 2 moves.\n\nBut if I go D to (4,2), then I have to go right to (5,2) then down to (5,1).\n\nIf I go R to (5,3), then down to (5,2) then down to (5,1).\n\nSimilar.\n\nBut if I go R first, to (5,3), then from (5,3) I have to go down, but I could go other directions, but I should go down to reach food.\n\nSimilarly, if I go D to (4,2), I should go right.\n\nBut let's see the state after.\n\nIn both cases, I eat on turn 23.\n\nAfter eating, if I am at (5,1) with dir D, I need to move left or right.\n\nIf I came from right, dir is D, same as if I came from above.\n\nNo difference.\n\nBut perhaps for the future, going left might be better because the left side has more space or less body.\n\nFor example, current body is on the right: (5,4), (5,5), etc., and left has (3,5), (2,5), but (2,6), (1,6), so the tail is on left bottom.\n\nBut as I move, it changes.\n\nPerhaps I should go left after eating to go towards the tail area where cells might be freed.\n\nBut not necessary.\n\nSince I need to output actions, I can plan the sequence to eat the food.\n\nSo for turn 21: move R to (5,3)\n\nThen turn 22: move D to (5,2)\n\nTurn 23: move D to (5,1) and eat.\n\nThen after that, I need to move away, say to (4,1) or (6,1).\n\nSuppose I go to (4,1) on turn 24.\n\nBut I need to specify actions.\n\nThe answer should include actions for multiple turns, but it might be open-ended.\n\nSince the food is eaten on turn 23, I can list up to there or beyond.\n\nBut think 5+ turns ahead, so I should plan for 5 turns.\n\nTurn 21,22,23,24,25.\n\nAfter turn 23, I need to survive.\n\nSo let's define the sequence.\n\nFirst, turn 21: move R to (5,3)\n\nAfter that, positions as above.\n\nTurn 22: from (5,3), dir R (since moved right), possible moves: R, U, D. I move D to (5,2)\n\nNew head (5,2), dir D.\n\nTurn 23: move D to (5,1), eat food. Now snake longer.\n\nHead at (5,1), dir D.\n\nNow turn 24: from (5,1), dir D, possible moves: L, R, D. But D to (5,0) wall, impossible. So only L or R.\n\nI choose to move L to (4,1), for example.\n\nThen new head (4,1), and since I moved left, dir now L? Previous dir D, moved L, so new dir L.\n\nPositions: after move to (4,1), head at (4,1), body: (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) — 11 segments.\n\n(2,6) is tail.\n\nNow from (4,1), dir L, possible moves: L, U, D. Cannot R (reverse).\n\nD to (4,0) wall, impossible. So only L to (3,1) or U to (4,2).\n\n(3,1) and (4,2) should be free.\n\nI can go U to (4,2).\n\nMove U to (4,2).\n\nThen head at (4,2), dir U (since moved up).\n\nThen turn 25: from (4,2), dir U, possible moves: U, L, R. Cannot D.\n\nU to (4,3), but (4,3) is occupied by body! (4,3) is the fourth segment: head (4,2), then (4,1)? After move to (4,2), positions: head (4,2), body: (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), etc.\n\nSpecifically: previous positions before move: head (4,1), body (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) — tail (2,6)\n\nAfter move U to (4,2): new head (4,2), body: previous head (4,1), then (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) — and tail (2,6) removed? No, since no eating, tail moves.\n\nAfter moving without eating, tail is removed.\n\nSo new positions: head (4,2), then (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) — and (2,5) becomes new tail? Let's list:\n\nSegments: after move, the body segments shift: the first body segment moves to previous head position, which was (4,1), but (4,1) is now occupied by new first body? Standard: new head at (4,2), then the segment that was at (4,1) becomes the new first body, but (4,1) was head, now it's body.\n\nThe segment that was at (5,1) moves to (4,1), which was previous head position.\n\nGeneral: when moving to a new cell without eating, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail cell is vacated.\n\nSo before move: positions: head (4,1), body segments: [ (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) ] — 11 body segments? No.\n\nAfter eating at turn 23, snake has 11 segments: head (5,1), and 10 body including tail.\n\nAt turn 23 after eating: positions: head (5,1), body: (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6) — that's 11 positions: head + 10 body, but body includes the tail.\n\nTypically, positions list has head and all body segments.\n\nAt turn 24, I move to (4,1) without eating, so new head at (4,1), then the first body segment is at previous head position (5,1), second body at previous first body position (5,2), and so on, down to the tail: the previous second last segment moves to previous last position, and the tail cell (2,6) is vacated.\n\nBefore move turn 24: positions: index 0: head (5,1), 1: (5,2), 2: (5,3), 3: (4,3), 4: (4,4), 5: (5,4), 6: (5,5), 7: (4,5), 8: (3,5), 9: (2,5), 10: (2,6) tail.\n\nAfter move to (4,1): new head at (4,1)\n\nThen segment 1 moves to previous head position (5,1)\n\nSegment 2 moves to previous segment 1 position (5,2)\n\nSegment 3 moves to previous segment 2 position (5,3)\n\nSegment 4 moves to previous segment 3 position (4,3)\n\nSegment 5 moves to previous segment 4 position (4,4)\n\nSegment 6 moves to previous segment 5 position (5,4)\n\nSegment 7 moves to previous segment 6 position (5,5)\n\nSegment 8 moves to previous segment 7 position (4,5)\n\nSegment 9 moves to previous segment 8 position (3,5)\n\nSegment 10 (tail) moves to previous segment 9 position (2,5)\n\nAnd previous tail position (2,6) is vacated.\n\nSo new positions: head (4,1), then (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nTail at (2,5)\n\nNow, on turn 25, from head (4,1), dir L (since moved left from (5,1) to (4,1), previous dir D, moved L, so new dir L.\n\nPossible moves: L to (3,1), U to (4,2), or D to (4,0) wall impossible, or R to (5,1) occupied, so only L or U.\n\nI said U to (4,2) earlier.\n\n(4,2) is free, so move U to (4,2).\n\nThen new head (4,2), dir U.\n\nNow positions after move: head (4,2), body: (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) — and tail moves to (2,5)? Before move: positions head (4,1), body (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nAfter move U to (4,2): new head (4,2)\n\nSegment 1 moves to (4,1)\n\nSegment 2 moves to (5,1)\n\nSegment 3 moves to (5,2)\n\nSegment 4 moves to (5,3)\n\nSegment 5 moves to (4,3)\n\nSegment 6 moves to (4,4)\n\nSegment 7 moves to (5,4)\n\nSegment 8 moves to (5,5)\n\nSegment 9 moves to (4,5)\n\nSegment 10 moves to (3,5)\n\nAnd previous tail (2,5) vacated.\n\nSo new positions: head (4,2), then (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) — tail at (3,5)\n\nNow from (4,2), dir U, I can move U, L, R.\n\nU to (4,3): but (4,3) is occupied by body (fifth segment: (4,3) after head)\n\nPositions: head (4,2), then (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), ... so (4,3) is occupied.\n\nCannot move up.\n\nL to (3,2): should be free.\n\nR to (5,2): but (5,2) is occupied (fourth segment (5,2))\n\nIn the list: after head (4,2), positions: (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), etc. so (5,2) is occupied.\n\nD to (4,1) occupied.\n\nSo only possible move L to (3,2).\n\nGo to (3,2).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI can continue moving to free cells.\n\nTo avoid this, after eating at (5,1), I could go right instead of left.\n\nFor example, on turn 24, from (5,1) move R to (6,1)\n\nThen similar.\n\nBut (6,1) to (6,2), etc.\n\n(6,2) might be free.\n\nBut in the body, no (6,y) occupied, so ok.\n\nThen I can go up to (6,3), etc.\n\nBut the point is, after eating, I can navigate away from the bottom.\n\nSo the plan is viable.\n\nTherefore, for the sequence:\n\nTurn 21: R (to approach food)\n\nTurn 22: D (to approach food)\n\nTurn 23: D (eat food)\n\nThen for survival, say turn 24: L (to (4,1))\n\nBut I need to output the actions.\n\nSince the question is to think ahead, but output starting from t1.\n\nI could output for turns 21 to 25.\n\nTurn 21: R\n\nTurn 22: D\n\nTurn 23: D\n\nTurn 24: L (to (4,1))\n\nTurn 25: U (to (4,2))\n\nBut on turn 25, from (4,1) to (4,2), as above.\n\nIn turn 25, if I am at (4,1), I move U to (4,2).\n\nThen later moves not specified.\n\nBut for the answer, I can list these.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nAnother thing: in turn 22, when I move D from (5,3) to (5,2), is there any issue?\n\n(5,2) should be safe, as before.\n\nSimilarly, all seems fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if there is negative food, but no, only positive.\n\nSo I think this is ok.\n\nBut the head direction: on turn 21, move R, so from dir D to R, allowed.\n\nThen turn 22, from dir R, move D, allowed.\n\nTurn 23, from dir D (after moving down), move D again, allowed.\n\nThen turn 24, from (5,1) dir D, move L to (4,1), now dir L.\n\nTurn 25, from (4,1) dir L, move U to (4,2), dir U.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating the positive food at (5,1) while ensuring long-term survival, I have planned a sequence of moves 5+ turns ahead. The food has a life span of 5, meaning it must be eaten by turn 25. The plan involves moving directly to eat the food on turn 23, which is within the life span, and then navigating away from the bottom wall to avoid getting trapped. The snake starts at (4,3) with direction Down, and the path to the food is safe with no immediate collisions. After eating, moves are chosen to steer the snake toward open spaces on the left side of the grid, where fewer body segments and the moving tail reduce collision risks.\n\n### Key Considerations in the Plan:\n- **Food Access**: Moving right on turn 21 positions the snake closer to (5,1). Down moves on turns 22 and 23 reach the food safely.\n- **Collision Avoidance**: All moves avoid walls, obstacles, and body segments. After eating, moving left then up opens a path to less congested areas.\n- **Direction Constraints**: No instant reverses (e.g., from Down, cannot go Up) are respected.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: After eating, the sequence prioritizes moving to (4,1) and then (4,2) to avoid the bottom wall and create space for future maneuvers. By turn 25, the snake is moving into safer territory with more options.\n- **Risk Assessment**: The internal obstacle at (5,6) and walls are avoided. The tail is not adjacent during the food approach, eliminating \"tail reward danger.\"\n\n### Planned Move Sequence (Turns 21 to 25):\n- **Turn 21**: Move R (right) to (5,3). This starts the approach to the food and avoids delaying, as the food life span is limited. Direction changes from Down to Right, which is allowed.\n- **Turn 22**: Move D (down) to (5,2). This continues toward the food, and the direction is now Down. (5,2) is safe and unoccupied.\n- **Turn 23**: Move D (down) to (5,1) to eat the food. The snake grows by 1 segment, increasing length to 11. Direction remains Down.\n- **Turn 24**: Move L (left) to (4,1). This moves the snake away from the bottom wall (y=0) and toward open cells on the left. Direction changes to Left.\n- **Turn 25**: Move U (up) to (4,2). This continues the escape from the high-risk bottom area and provides multiple future move options (e.g., left to (3,2) or up if space allows). Direction is now Up.\n\n### Beyond Turn 25:\n- The snake will be at (4,2) with direction Up. From here, future moves (e.g., left to (3,2) or up if (4,3) becomes free as the tail moves) can be planned to navigate toward the center or left side of the grid. The tail will continue moving, freeing cells like (2,5) and reducing collision risks. This ensures the snake can survive for many more turns and capitalize on any new food that appears.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 21: R (right)\nTurn 22: D (down)\nTurn 23: D (down)\nTurn 24: L (left)\nTurn 25: U (up)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 7x7 grid because the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6). There's also an internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nCurrent turn is t=22.\n\nSnake positions: head at (5,3), then body segments: (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6). So the snake has 10 segments.\n\nHead direction is right, which is R. That means the snake is moving to the right, so from (5,3), if it continues right, it would go to (6,3).\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (5,1) with value 1 and life span 4. So it disappears after 4 turns, including this one, so it will be gone after turn 25 (since current is 22, 22,23,24,25 – that's 4 turns).\n\n- (6,1) with value 1 and life span 10, so it lasts until turn 31 (22 to 31 is 10 turns? Let's calculate: from turn 22 to turn 31 is 10 turns? Turn 22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31 – that's 10 turns, but life span decreases each turn including current, so at turn 22, life span 10 means it has 10 turns left, including turn 22. So after 10 turns, on turn 32, it should be gone. Life span: if life span is L at turn t, it disappears after t + L - 1 or something? Let's clarify.\n\nThe problem says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for food at (5,1): life span 4 at turn 22. Countdown: turn 22: 4, turn 23: 3, turn 24: 2, turn 25: 1, turn 26: 0? But it says \"disappears after N turns\", meaning after N turns from now, it's gone.\n\nI think it's better to think: at the start of turn t, if life span is L, it will disappear after L turns, so it's available for L turns including the current one if eaten.\n\nBut for planning, I need to know when it will be gone.\n\nFor (5,1): life span 4 at turn 22. So:\n\n- Turn 22: available\n\n- Turn 23: available if not eaten\n\n- Turn 24: available\n\n- Turn 25: available\n\n- After turn 25, it disappears, so not available on turn 26.\n\nSimilarly for (6,1): life span 10, available from turn 22 to turn 31 (since 22 to 31 is 10 turns: 22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31 – that's 10 instances).\n\nTurn 22 to turn 31 inclusive is 10 turns? Let's count: 22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31 – that's 10 turns. Yes.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead. The answer should include actions for turn 22, 23, 24, etc., but how many turns? It says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should plan at least 5 turns.\n\nAlso, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, since walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,6), so that cell is blocked.\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (5,3)\n\nBody: (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)\n\nSo let's list all snake segments:\n\n1. Head: (5,3)\n\n2. (4,3)\n\n3. (4,4)\n\n4. (5,4)\n\n5. (5,5)\n\n6. (4,5)\n\n7. (3,5)\n\n8. (2,5)\n\n9. (2,6)\n\n10. (1,6)  // tail\n\nNow, head direction is R, so moving right.\n\nPossible moves from (5,3): since head is at (5,3), and direction is R, but I can choose to go U, D, L, R, but with no instant reverse. Reverse of R is L, so I cannot go L immediately.\n\nCurrent direction is R, so I cannot move left (L) on this turn.\n\nAllowed moves: U (up), D (down), R (right). L is not allowed.\n\nNow, grid:\n\n- Walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls, so cells outside 1-6 in x or y are walls.\n\n- Internal obstacle: (5,6)\n\n- Food: (5,1) and (6,1)\n\nNow, (5,1) is below, and (6,1) is to the right-down.\n\nCurrent head at (5,3).\n\nIf I move right to (6,3), that should be safe? Let's see what cells are occupied.\n\nSnake body: (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)\n\n(6,3) is not in this list, and not a wall, so moving to (6,3) is safe for now.\n\nSimilarly, if I go up to (5,4), but (5,4) is a body segment? Positions: (5,4) is the fourth segment, so it's occupied by the snake body. If I move up to (5,4), that would be colliding with body, since (5,4) is not the tail; the tail is at (1,6).\n\nTail is at (1,6), so (5,4) is a body part, cannot move there.\n\nSimilarly, down to (5,2): is that occupied? Snake positions: (5,3), (4,3), etc., (5,2) not listed, so should be free.\n\nLet's list all occupied cells by snake:\n\n- (5,3) - head\n\n- (4,3)\n\n- (4,4)\n\n- (5,4)\n\n- (5,5)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (3,5)\n\n- (2,5)\n\n- (2,6)\n\n- (1,6)\n\nSo occupied: (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)\n\nNow, from head (5,3), possible moves:\n\n- U: (5,4) - but (5,4) is occupied, so collision, death.\n\n- D: (5,2) - not occupied, not wall? y=2 is within 1-6, x=5 within 1-6, no internal obstacle, so should be safe.\n\n- L: (4,3) - but (4,3) is occupied by body, and also, moving left is reverse? Current direction is R, so L is reverse, which is not allowed. But even if allowed, it's occupied.\n\n- R: (6,3) - not occupied, not wall, x=6 is border? Walls are x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is playable, since x=7 is wall. Similarly y=6 is playable, y=7 wall.\n\nGrid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nSo (6,3) is within bounds, no obstacle.\n\nTherefore, possible moves from (5,3) are:\n\n- D: to (5,2)\n\n- R: to (6,3)\n\nU and L are not possible.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead.\n\nFood is at (5,1) and (6,1), both positive, value 1.\n\n(5,1) has life span 4, so must be eaten by turn 25 or it disappears.\n\n(6,1) has longer life.\n\nBut (5,1) is directly below, at (5,2) then (5,1).\n\nIf I move down to (5,2), then next turn I can go down to (5,1) to eat it.\n\nBut I need to check if that's safe.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving R to (6,3) on turn 22.\n\nThen head at (6,3).\n\nNow, direction would be R, so for next turn, cannot move left (L).\n\nPossible moves from (6,3): U to (6,4), D to (6,2), R to (7,3) but x=7 is wall, so invalid. L to (5,3), but (5,3) was head, but after moving, the snake moves, so positions change.\n\nI need to simulate the snake movement.\n\nWhen the snake moves, the head goes to new position, and each body segment follows, so the tail moves away.\n\nOn turn 22, if I move R to (6,3), new head position (6,3), then body segments: the first body segment moves to previous head position (5,3), then next to previous (4,3), and so on, tail at (1,6) moves to (2,6)? Let's see the order.\n\nSnake positions before move: [ (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6) ]\n\nAfter moving head to (6,3), the new positions:\n\n- Head: (6,3)\n\n- Segment 1: previous head (5,3)\n\n- Segment 2: previous seg1 (4,3)\n\n- Segment 3: previous seg2 (4,4)\n\n- Segment 4: previous seg3 (5,4)  // (4,4) to (5,4)? Positions: seg3 was at (4,4), moves to where seg2 was? No.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the list.\n\nSo new positions:\n\n- Head: new position, say P\n\n- Body[0]: old head position\n\n- Body[1]: old body[0] position\n\n- ...\n\n- Tail: old body last position\n\nSo for this snake, indices: let's say positions list: index 0: head, 1: body1, 2: body2, ..., 9: tail.\n\nAfter move:\n\n- New head: the new cell\n\n- New pos[0] = new head\n\n- New pos[1] = old pos[0]  // which was head\n\n- New pos[2] = old pos[1]\n\n- ...\n\n- New pos[9] = old pos[8]  // tail moves to where the second last was\n\nOld positions:\n\npos[0]: (5,3) head\n\npos[1]: (4,3)\n\npos[2]: (4,4)\n\npos[3]: (5,4)\n\npos[4]: (5,5)\n\npos[5]: (4,5)\n\npos[6]: (3,5)\n\npos[7]: (2,5)\n\npos[8]: (2,6)\n\npos[9]: (1,6) tail\n\nAfter moving head to (6,3):\n\nNew positions:\n\n- Head: (6,3)\n\n- pos[1]: old head (5,3)\n\n- pos[2]: old pos[1] (4,3)\n\n- pos[3]: old pos[2] (4,4)\n\n- pos[4]: old pos[3] (5,4)\n\n- pos[5]: old pos[4] (5,5)\n\n- pos[6]: old pos[5] (4,5)\n\n- pos[7]: old pos[6] (3,5)\n\n- pos[8]: old pos[7] (2,5)\n\n- pos[9]: old pos[8] (2,6)  // tail at (2,6), old tail (1,6) is now empty.\n\nSo the cell (1,6) is now free, and food could be there, but not currently.\n\nNow, food at (5,1) and (6,1) still there.\n\nNow, for turn 23, head at (6,3), direction is R (since moved right).\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U: to (6,4) - is it free? New occupied: (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)\n\n(6,4) not in list, so free.\n\n- D: to (6,2) - free\n\n- L: to (5,3) - but (5,3) is now occupied by pos[1], so body, cannot.\n\n- R: to (7,3) - x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo possible: U or D.\n\nIf I go U to (6,4), or D to (6,2).\n\n(6,2) is closer to food at (6,1).\n\nSimilarly, food at (5,1) is below.\n\nBut let's think about eating (5,1) which has short life.\n\nBack to turn 22 choice.\n\nOption 1: Move D to (5,2) on turn 22.\n\nThen new head at (5,2).\n\nDirection: since moved down, new direction is D.\n\nNew positions:\n\n- Head: (5,2)\n\n- pos[1]: old head (5,3)\n\n- pos[2]: old pos[1] (4,3)\n\n- pos[3]: old pos[2] (4,4)\n\n- pos[4]: old pos[3] (5,4)\n\n- pos[5]: old pos[4] (5,5)\n\n- pos[6]: old pos[5] (4,5)\n\n- pos[7]: old pos[6] (3,5)\n\n- pos[8]: old pos[7] (2,5)\n\n- pos[9]: old pos[8] (2,6)  // tail at (2,6), old (1,6) free.\n\nNow, from (5,2), I can go down to (5,1) to eat the food on turn 23.\n\nBut is (5,1) available? Yes, and it's positive food.\n\nIf I eat it, snake grows, so length increases by 1.\n\nWhen you eat food, on the turn you move to the food cell, you eat it, and the tail doesn't move that turn, so the snake grows.\n\nOtherwise, tail moves.\n\nIn this case, if on turn 23 I move to (5,1), I eat the food, so new head at (5,1), and the tail doesn't move, so the body segments shift, but tail stays, so new segment added at the end.\n\nBut first, from (5,2) on turn 23, move D to (5,1).\n\nBut before that, on turn 22, I moved to (5,2), which is not food, so no eat, tail moved.\n\nNow turn 23: head at (5,2), move to (5,1), which is food.\n\nEat food: new head at (5,1), and since ate, tail does not move, so the body positions: new head (5,1), then new pos[1] = old head (5,2), pos[2] = old pos[1] (5,3), and so on, up to pos[10] = old pos[9] (2,6)? Let's see.\n\nAfter turn 22 move to (5,2), positions:\n\n- Head: (5,2)\n\n- Body: (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)  // 10 segments? No.\n\nTurn 22 after move: positions list:\n\n- Index 0: (5,2) head\n\n- Index 1: (5,3)  // old head\n\n- Index 2: (4,3)  // old index 1\n\n- Index 3: (4,4)  // old index 2\n\n- Index 4: (5,4)  // old index 3\n\n- Index 5: (5,5)  // old index 4\n\n- Index 6: (4,5)  // old index 5\n\n- Index 7: (3,5)  // old index 6\n\n- Index 8: (2,5)  // old index 7\n\n- Index 9: (2,6)  // old index 8, tail\n\nOld index 9 (1,6) is gone.\n\nNow turn 23: move to (5,1) and eat food.\n\nNew positions:\n\n- Head: (5,1)\n\n- Then, since ate, the tail doesn't move, so we add a new segment at the end. So positions: new head (5,1), then all previous segments except tail stays.\n\nAfter eating, the body segments are: the new head at food cell, then the old head, then old body, and the tail remains in place, so the snake grows by one segment.\n\nSo:\n\n- New head: (5,1)\n\n- New pos[1]: old head (5,2)\n\n- New pos[2]: old pos[1] (5,3)\n\n- New pos[3]: old pos[2] (4,3)\n\n- New pos[4]: old pos[3] (4,4)\n\n- New pos[5]: old pos[4] (5,4)\n\n- New pos[6]: old pos[5] (5,5)\n\n- New pos[7]: old pos[6] (4,5)\n\n- New pos[8]: old pos[7] (3,5)\n\n- New pos[9]: old pos[8] (2,5)\n\n- New pos[10]: old pos[9] (2,6)  // new tail, since tail didn't move.\n\nOld tail was (2,6), and since not moved, it becomes part of the body, and new tail is added? No.\n\nStandard: when you eat, the tail doesn't move, so the segment that was tail remains, and a new segment is added where the tail was, but the positions shift.\n\nIn terms of list: the new position list has the new head, then the entire old position list except the tail is kept, but since tail didn't move, the last position is the same as old tail.\n\nIn this case, old positions before move: head (5,2), body (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), tail (2,6)\n\nAfter moving to (5,1) and eating:\n\n- Head: (5,1)\n\n- Then the rest: (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), and tail still (2,6) since not moved, so we have 11 segments.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, is there any danger? (5,1) is not under body, so fine.\n\nBut after eating, the snake is longer.\n\nNow, back to turn 22, if I go down, I can eat (5,1) on turn 23.\n\nBut let's see the other option.\n\nIf on turn 22 I go right to (6,3).\n\nThen turn 23, head at (6,3), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,4) or D to (6,2).\n\n(6,2) is closer to food (6,1).\n\nIf I go D to (6,2) on turn 23, then from there, I can go to (6,1) on turn 24 to eat it.\n\n(6,1) has longer life, so no rush.\n\nBut (5,1) has only 4 turns life, from turn 22, so if I don't eat it soon, it disappears.\n\nOn turn 22, if I go to (6,3), then on turn 23, if I go to (6,2), then turn 24 to (6,1), I eat (6,1).\n\nBut (5,1) might still be there, but I need to go to (5,1) from (6,1) or something.\n\nFrom (6,1), I can go left to (5,1), but (5,1) might be gone by turn 25 or so.\n\nLet's see the timing.\n\nTurn 22: I move to (6,3)\n\nThen turn 23: say I move D to (6,2)\n\nThen turn 24: move to (6,1) and eat (6,1)\n\nNow, (5,1) life span 4 at turn 22: available turn 22,23,24,25; disappears after turn 25, so not available turn 26.\n\nOn turn 24, I eat (6,1), head at (6,1).\n\nThen on turn 25, I can move to, say, (5,1) if I want to eat it.\n\nFrom (6,1), possible moves: U to (6,2), but (6,2) might be occupied? Let's simulate.\n\nAfter turn 24: ate (6,1), so positions:\n\nFirst, after turn 22 move to (6,3): positions: head (6,3), body (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)\n\nTurn 23 move D to (6,2): not food, so tail moves.\n\nNew positions: head (6,2), body (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)  // tail now (2,5), old tail (2,6) free.\n\nTurn 24 move to (6,1) and eat (6,1): so new head (6,1), then since ate, tail doesn't move, so positions: head (6,1), body (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), tail (2,5)  // 11 segments.\n\nNow on turn 25, head at (6,1), direction D (since last move down).\n\nPossible moves: L to (5,1), U to (6,2), R invalid (x=7 wall), D invalid (y=0 wall? y=1, D to (6,0) wall, invalid).\n\ny=1, down to (6,0) which is y=0, wall.\n\nU to (6,2): but (6,2) is now a body segment, occupied.\n\nL to (5,1): (5,1) is food, but is it available? Turn 25, (5,1) life span 4 from turn 22, so on turn 25, countdown: turn 22:4, 23:3, 24:2, 25:1, so still available, turn 26 it disappears.\n\nSo (5,1) is available on turn 25.\n\nIf I move L to (5,1), I can eat it.\n\nBut is (5,1) safe? Currently, from above positions, (5,1) is free, not occupied.\n\nBut I need to check if moving there causes collision.\n\nHead at (6,1), move left to (5,1).\n\n(5,1) is not in current positions: positions are (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), etc., not (5,1), so should be fine.\n\nEat (5,1), then snake grows again.\n\nBut is there a risk? The special case: tail reward danger.\n\nIf head is adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, but here (5,1) is not the tail, tail is at (2,5), far away.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nThus, I could eat both foods.\n\nBut in this path, I eat (6,1) on turn 24 and (5,1) on turn 25, both before (5,1) disappears.\n\n(5,1) disappears after turn 25, so eating on turn 25 is the last chance.\n\nIn this sequence, it works.\n\nBut let's confirm the turns.\n\nTurn 22: move R to (6,3)\n\nTurn 23: move D to (6,2)\n\nTurn 24: move D to (6,1) eat\n\nTurn 25: move L to (5,1) eat\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the first option: on turn 22 move D to (5,2), then turn 23 move D to (5,1) eat, then I have (5,1) eaten earlier, and (6,1) still there for later.\n\nBut I need to think about survival and risks.\n\nIn the first path, when I go to (6,3) on turn 22, then (6,2) on 23, (6,1) on 24, then (5,1) on 25.\n\nBut after eating (5,1) on turn 25, head at (5,1), and direction L (since moved left).\n\nThen what? I need to move somewhere.\n\nPossible moves from (5,1): U to (5,2), D invalid (y=0), L to (4,1), R to (6,1) but (6,1) was eaten, no food there now? After turn 24, (6,1) eaten, so no food, and positions: after turn 25 eat (5,1), let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, after turn 25 eat (5,1), positions: head (5,1), then previous head (6,1), etc., but let's see the area.\n\n(5,1) is bottom row, y=1.\n\nMoves: U to (5,2), L to (4,1), R to (6,1).\n\n(6,1) might be occupied? After turn 24, positions include (6,1) as head, but after move to (5,1) and eat, new positions:\n\nBefore turn 25 move: after turn 24, positions: head (6,1), body (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), tail (2,5)\n\nMove L to (5,1) and eat: so new head (5,1), then old head (6,1), old body (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), and tail (2,5) since not moved, so 12 segments.\n\nNow head at (5,1), direction L.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- U to (5,2): is (5,2) free? Current positions: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\n(5,2) not listed, so free.\n\n- L to (4,1): not occupied, should be free.\n\n- R to (6,1): but (6,1) is occupied by the first body segment, so collision.\n\nD invalid.\n\nSo possible U or L.\n\nIf I go U to (5,2), or L to (4,1).\n\nSimilarly, in the other path.\n\nBut there might be risks later.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (5,6), which is top-right, but currently snake is around bottom.\n\nNow, back to turn 22 decision.\n\nIf I go down to (5,2) on turn 22, I can eat (5,1) on turn 23, then I have head at (5,1) on turn 23.\n\nThen from there, I can go to eat (6,1) or other places.\n\nBut (6,1) is to the right.\n\nFrom (5,1) after eating, on turn 23, head at (5,1), direction D (since moved down to get there).\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,2), L to (4,1), R to (6,1).\n\n(6,1) is free, not occupied.\n\nSo I can go R to (6,1) to eat it on turn 24? Turn 23: at (5,1), move to (6,1) if possible.\n\nDirection: last move was down to (5,1), so direction D.\n\nMoving right to (6,1) is not reverse; reverse would be up, but up is opposite to down? Directions: U and D are opposites, L and R are opposites.\n\nCurrent direction D, so cannot move U.\n\nMoving R is allowed.\n\nSo from (5,1), move R to (6,1), which is food, eat it.\n\nThen positions: head (6,1), then old head (5,1), and so on, snake grows.\n\nBut let's sequence.\n\nTurn 22: move D to (5,2) -- not food, so positions: head (5,2), body (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)\n\nTurn 23: move D to (5,1) and eat (5,1): new head (5,1), body (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), tail (2,6)  // 11 segments, direction D.\n\nThen turn 24: from (5,1), move R to (6,1) and eat (6,1): new head (6,1), body (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), tail (2,6)  // 12 segments, direction R.\n\nThen head at (6,1), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,2), L to (5,1), D invalid, R invalid.\n\nL to (5,1): (5,1) is body segment, occupied, so collision if move there.\n\nU to (6,2): may be free or not.\n\nCurrent positions: (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)\n\n(6,2) not listed, so free.\n\nSo can go U to (6,2).\n\nSimilarly, in both cases, I can eat both foods by turn 24 or 25.\n\nBut in the first sequence (going right first), I eat them on turn 24 and 25, in second (down first) on turn 23 and 24.\n\nNow, which is better for long-term survival?\n\nI need to think about the future board state.\n\nAlso, there might be risks with the body.\n\nIn the down-first path, after eating both, head at (6,1) on turn 24, then I go U to (6,2).\n\nBut let's see the area around.\n\nThere is an internal obstacle at (5,6), which might be relevant if I go up.\n\nBut currently, the snake body is in the bottom-left to center.\n\nPositions after turn 24 in down-first: head (6,1), body (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), tail (2,6)\n\nSo the body occupies (5,3), (4,3), etc., and (5,4), (5,5), so the area around (5,5) to (3,5) is body.\n\n(6,2) is free, so moving up is ok.\n\nThen from there, I can go further.\n\nBut I need to plan 5+ turns ahead.\n\nTurn 22 to turn 26 or so.\n\nAlso, prioritize survival, so avoid getting trapped.\n\nIn the right-first path, after eating both, head at (5,1) on turn 25, then I can go U or L.\n\nFor example, go to (5,2) or (4,1).\n\n(4,1) might be free.\n\nBut let's think about the tail or openings.\n\nNotice that in the snake body, there is a loop or something.\n\nInitial positions: from (5,3) to (4,3) to (4,4) to (5,4) to (5,5) to (4,5) to (3,5) etc., so there is a 2x2 block from (4,3) to (4,4) to (5,4) to (5,3) but (5,3) is head, moving.\n\nPerhaps not a problem.\n\nAnother thing: the food (5,1) might be under the body? But in this case, it's not; (5,1) is free.\n\nIn the state, food is at (5,1), which is not occupied by snake, so fine.\n\nNow, for long-term, I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nThe grid has walls and an obstacle at (5,6).\n\nPlayable area: rows 1-6, columns 1-6, except (5,6) blocked.\n\nAvailable cells: 36 total, minus 1 obstacle, 35 cells, snake has 10 segments, so 25 free cells.\n\nAfter eating two foods, snake will be 12 segments.\n\nBut I need to survive.\n\nIn both sequences, I can eat both foods.\n\nBut in the down-first, I eat (5,1) on turn 23 and (6,1) on turn 24.\n\nIn right-first, I eat (6,1) on turn 24 and (5,1) on turn 25.\n\nSince (5,1) has short life, eating it earlier might be safer, but both work.\n\nBut let's see if there is a risk in going right first.\n\nIf on turn 22 I go right to (6,3), then turn 23 I go down to (6,2), turn 24 to (6,1), all fine.\n\nThen turn 25 to (5,1) eat.\n\nBut on turn 25, when I move from (6,1) to (5,1), is there any issue?\n\nAs above, it should be fine.\n\nHowever, there is a special case mentioned: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves on.\"\n\nBut here, (5,1) is not under body, so no issue.\n\nAlso, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills.\n\nBut in this case, tail is at (2,5) or wherever, not adjacent to head.\n\nHead at (6,1), tail at (2,5) in some cases, far away.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps for survival, going down first is better because I eat the short-life food earlier, reducing risk of missing it if something happens.\n\nBut both seem possible.\n\nAnother point: after eating, the snake is longer, might be harder to maneuever.\n\nBut in this grid, with obstacle, it might be tight.\n\nLet's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid rows y=1 to 6, columns x=1 to 6.\n\nObstacle at (5,6) blocked.\n\nInitial snake: head (5,3), then (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6)\n\nSo the snake is like: from (5,3) right? Head (5,3), then left to (4,3), then up to (4,4), then right to (5,4), then up to (5,5), then left to (4,5), then left to (3,5), then down to (2,5)? (2,5) to (2,6) down? y increase or decrease.\n\ny=0 bottom, y=7 top? No, walls y=0 and y=7, so y=0 is bottom, y=6 is top? Let's define.\n\nTypically in grids, y=0 bottom, y increasing up, or y=0 top.\n\nIn the problem, walls y=0 and y=7, and snake positions, e.g., (5,3) to (5,4) to (5,5), so y increasing is up, I think.\n\nFrom (5,3) to (5,4) to (5,5), y increasing, so y=5 is above y=4, etc.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) to (2,6), y=6 above y=5.\n\nAnd (1,6) is top-left? x=1,y=6.\n\nFood at (5,1) and (6,1), bottom row.\n\nSo grid: bottom row y=1, top y=6.\n\nLeft x=1, right x=6.\n\nObstacle at (5,6), which is top-right, but x=5,y=6.\n\nNow, after eating both foods, in down-first path, head at (6,1), with body around.\n\nThe free areas are left and up.\n\nFor example, from (6,1), I can go U to (6,2), then to (6,3), etc.\n\nBut (6,3) might be occupied later.\n\nIn the sequence, when I go to (6,2), it might be free.\n\nSimilarly, I can go left to (5,1) but occupied, or from (6,2) to (6,3) or (5,2), etc.\n\nTo avoid getting stuck, I should move towards the center or open areas.\n\nCurrently, the top-right has obstacle, so (5,6) blocked.\n\nThe tail is at (2,6) or moving.\n\nIn down-first after turn 24: positions include (2,6) as tail, but after moves, it changes.\n\nPerhaps for now, both options are ok, but let's see the head direction.\n\nOn turn 22, if I go down, I eat (5,1) on turn 23, then on turn 24 I eat (6,1), then on turn 25 from (6,1) I can go U to (6,2), then from there to (6,3) or (5,2), etc.\n\n(5,2) might be occupied; in the positions, after turn 24, (5,2) is body.\n\nIn down-first after turn 24: head (6,1), body (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), tail (2,6)\n\nSo (5,2) is occupied.\n\nFrom (6,1) to (6,2) on turn 25: (6,2) is free, so move U to (6,2).\n\nThen new positions: not eating, so tail moves, head (6,2), body (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), tail (2,5)  // (2,6) gone.\n\nThen from (6,2), I can go U to (6,3), or L to (5,2), but (5,2) occupied, or R invalid.\n\nU to (6,3): (6,3) free? Not occupied, so ok.\n\nThen to (6,4), etc.\n\nSimilarly, in the right-first path, after turn 25, head at (5,1), I can go U to (5,2) or L to (4,1).\n\n(4,1) might be free.\n\nThen to (3,1) or (4,2), etc.\n\nBoth seem viable.\n\nBut let's think about the internal obstacle.\n\n(5,6) blocked, so the cell (5,6) is not accessible.\n\nThe snake has a segment at (5,5) in initial, which is below (5,6).\n\nIf I go up, I might be blocked.\n\nFor example, from (5,5), I can go to (5,6) but it's blocked, so I cannot.\n\nIn the body, it's not head.\n\nBut for head movement, later.\n\nTo maximize score, I should eat both foods, which I can in both cases.\n\nBut there might be other foods later, but no other foods given, so only these two for now.\n\nI need to survive, so after eating, I should have space to move.\n\nIn the current state, with snake occupying many cells, the free cells are scattered.\n\nFor example, top-left: (1,1) to (1,5), (1,6) is tail but moving.\n\n(1,6) is tail, so when snake moves, it frees up.\n\nAlso, (3,6), (4,6), etc., but (5,6) blocked.\n\n(6,6) is free, but might be hard to reach.\n\nPerhaps it's better to go towards the left where there is more space.\n\nFor instance, in the snake, the tail is at (1,6), and body from (2,6) to (2,5) to (3,5) etc.\n\nAs the snake moves, the tail moves, freeing cells.\n\nIf I move in a way that I can loop or something.\n\nBut with the obstacle, it might be tricky.\n\nSince I need to think 5 turns ahead, let's plan the sequence.\n\nFirst, let's list the actions for each turn.\n\nOption A: Turn 22 move D to (5,2)\n\nThen turn 23 move D to (5,1) eat\n\nThen turn 24 move R to (6,1) eat\n\nThen turn 25: from (6,1), move U to (6,2)  (since L and R invalid or occupied, D invalid)\n\nThen turn 26: from (6,2), move U to (6,3)  (if possible)\n\n(6,3) should be free.\n\nThen turn 27: from (6,3), move U to (6,4) or L to (5,3), etc.\n\nBut (5,3) might be occupied.\n\nAfter turn 24: positions with 12 segments, as above.\n\nAfter turn 25 move U to (6,2): not eat, so tail moves.\n\nPositions: head (6,2), body (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), tail (2,5)  // (2,6) gone\n\n(2,5) tail.\n\nThen turn 26 move U to (6,3): (6,3) free, so head to (6,3), body follows: new head (6,3), body (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), tail (3,5)  // (2,5) gone? Old tail (2,5), new tail old body last, (3,5)\n\nPositions: new head (6,3), new pos[1] = old head (6,2), new pos[2] = old pos[1] (6,1), new pos[3] = old pos[2] (5,1), ..., new pos[11] = old pos[10] (3,5), and tail is new pos[11], which is (3,5)\n\nOld positions had 12 segments, after move no eat, so still 12, tail moves from (2,5) to where? Old tail (2,5), but in the list, old pos[11] was (2,5)? Let's index.\n\nAfter turn 25: positions: index 0: (6,2) head, index 1: (6,1), index 2: (5,1), index 3: (5,2), index 4: (5,3), index 5: (4,3), index 6: (4,4), index 7: (5,4), index 8: (5,5), index 9: (4,5), index 10: (3,5), index 11: (2,5) tail\n\nMove to (6,3): new head (6,3), new pos[1] = old pos[0] (6,2), new pos[2] = old pos[1] (6,1), new pos[3] = old pos[2] (5,1), new pos[4] = old pos[3] (5,2), new pos[5] = old pos[4] (5,3), new pos[6] = old pos[5] (4,3), new pos[7] = old pos[6] (4,4), new pos[8] = old pos[7] (5,4), new pos[9] = old pos[8] (5,5), new pos[10] = old pos[9] (4,5), new pos[11] = old pos[10] (3,5)  // tail at (3,5)\n\nOld tail (2,5) is gone.\n\n(6,3) was free, so ok.\n\nThen from (6,3), I can go U to (6,4), L to (5,3), or D to (6,2) but occupied.\n\n(5,3) is occupied by new pos[5] (5,3), so cannot go L.\n\nU to (6,4) or D to (6,2) occupied.\n\nD to (6,2) is body, so only U to (6,4) if free.\n\n(6,4) not occupied, so can go U.\n\nSimilarly, I can continue up.\n\nBut at (6,4), then (6,5), but (6,5) might be free, then (6,6), but y=6 is top, (6,6) is corner, then I might be trapped if not careful.\n\n(6,6) is free, but from there, only down or left, but left to (5,6) is blocked, so only down to (6,5), but (6,5) might be body.\n\nFor example, after moving to (6,4), then to (6,5), then to (6,6), then from (6,6), can go D to (6,5) but occupied, or L to (5,6) blocked, so stuck, death.\n\nOh, problem.\n\nIn this path, if I go up to (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), I get trapped.\n\nTherefore, I need to turn left earlier.\n\nFor example, from (6,3), instead of U, I could go L to (5,3) but occupied, so only U possible.\n\nFrom (6,3), after turn 26, positions have (5,3) occupied, so I must go U to (6,4).\n\nThen from (6,4), similar issue.\n\nFrom (6,4), after moving there, positions: head (6,4), body (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), tail (4,5) or something.\n\nThen from (6,4), I can go U to (6,5), L to (5,4), or D to (6,3) occupied.\n\nL to (5,4): (5,4) is occupied, as body.\n\nU to (6,5) free, probably.\n\nThen to (6,5), then to (6,6), stuck.\n\nSo indeed, in this path, I will be forced to go to (6,6) and die.\n\nTherefore, the down-first option with going up leads to death.\n\nI need to avoid that.\n\nIn the sequence, after eating at (6,1), I should not go up, but go left or something.\n\nBut from (6,1), on turn 25, I can only go U, since L and R not possible, D not.\n\nIn down-first, on turn 24 I am at (6,1), after eating (6,1), so on turn 25, only U possible to (6,2).\n\nThen from (6,2), on turn 25, I can only go U to (6,3) or L to (5,2), but (5,2) occupied, so only U to (6,3).\n\nThen from (6,3), only U to (6,4), and so on, inevitably to (6,6) and death.\n\nSo this path is fatal.\n\nTherefore, the option to go down first on turn 22 leads to a dead end.\n\nI must choose the other option: on turn 22 go right to (6,3).\n\nThen from there, I can go down to (6,2) on turn 23, then to (6,1) on turn 24, then to (5,1) on turn 25.\n\nNow, after turn 25, head at (5,1), direction L (since moved left).\n\nPositions: as earlier, after eating (5,1) on turn 25, positions: head (5,1), body (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), tail (2,5)\n\nNow on turn 26, head at (5,1), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,2), L to (4,1), R to (6,1) occupied.\n\nD invalid.\n\n(5,2) not occupied, (4,1) not occupied.\n\nSo I can go U or L.\n\nIf I go L to (4,1), for example.\n\nThen to (3,1), etc., towards left.\n\nOr U to (5,2).\n\n(5,2) is free, so I can go there.\n\nThen from (5,2), I can go to other places.\n\nFor instance, go U to (5,3), but (5,3) is occupied in the body.\n\nAfter moving to (4,1) or (5,2), the body moves, freeing some cells.\n\nThis seems better for survival.\n\nSo let's plan.\n\nTurn 22: move R to (6,3)\n\nTurn 23: move D to (6,2)  // not food\n\nTurn 24: move D to (6,1) and eat (6,1)\n\nTurn 25: move L to (5,1) and eat (5,1)\n\nNow on turn 26, head at (5,1), direction L.\n\nI need to choose move.\n\nTo avoid the right column, I should go left or up.\n\nSay, move L to (4,1)\n\nThen new head (4,1), not food, so tail moves.\n\nNew positions: head (4,1), body (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), tail (3,5)  // (2,5) gone\n\nThen from (4,1), I can go U to (4,2), L to (3,1), or R to (5,1) occupied.\n\n(4,2) and (3,1) should be free.\n\nGo to (3,1), for example.\n\nThen to (2,1), etc.\n\nOr up.\n\nSince the top has the obstacle, but bottom-left is open.\n\nI could go towards the tail area to free space.\n\nBut this seems survivable.\n\nIf on turn 26 I go U to (5,2), then head at (5,2), then I can go U to (5,3) but occupied, or L to (4,2), or R to (6,2) occupied.\n\nL to (4,2) if free.\n\n(4,2) not occupied, so ok.\n\nThen continue.\n\nBut going left to (4,1) might be better to explore left side.\n\nIn any case, no immediate dead end.\n\nTherefore, for turn 22, I should move right to (6,3).\n\nThen for subsequent turns.\n\nThe answer should include multiple turns.\n\nThink 5+ turns ahead, so at least up to turn 27.\n\nTurn 22: R\n\nTurn 23: D (to (6,2))\n\nTurn 24: D (to (6,1) eat)\n\nTurn 25: L (to (5,1) eat)\n\nThen turn 26: say L to (4,1)\n\nTurn 27: from (4,1), I can go U or L, say U to (4,2) or L to (3,1).\n\nBut I need to specify.\n\nSince the food is eaten, and no other food, I just need to survive.\n\nBut for the answer, I should provide actions for a few turns.\n\nThe format is to list actions starting from turn 22.\n\nAnd since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should list about 5 turns.\n\nTurn 22 to 26 or 27.\n\nNow, on turn 26, from (5,1), after turn 25, I move L to (4,1).\n\nThen turn 27 from (4,1), I can move L to (3,1) or U to (4,2).\n\nTo keep options open, say U to (4,2).\n\nThen turn 28 to (4,3) but might be occupied, etc.\n\nBut I don't need to specify all, just the immediate actions.\n\nFor the answer, list turns from 22 onwards for a few steps.\n\nSince the critical part is to eat both foods and avoid the dead end.\n\nSo for turn 22: R\n\nTurn 23: D\n\nTurn 24: D\n\nTurn 25: L\n\nThen for turn 26, I can add, say L to (4,1)\n\nBut to be precise.\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 23, when I move to (6,2), it might not be necessary, but it is.\n\nAnother thing: in turn 23, from (6,3), I could go U to (6,4) instead of D to (6,2).\n\nBut if I go U, then I might not reach the food in time or something.\n\nFor example, if turn 23 go U to (6,4), then from there, I can go to (6,5) or (5,4), but (5,4) might be occupied.\n\nThen to reach (6,1), it takes longer.\n\n(6,1) has long life, but (5,1) might expire.\n\nTurn 23: at (6,3), go U to (6,4)\n\nThen positions: head (6,4), body (6,3), (5,3), etc.\n\nThen turn 24, from (6,4), go U to (6,5) or L to (5,4), etc.\n\nBut to go down to (6,3) occupied, so hard to reach (6,1) quickly.\n\nThen (5,1) disappears after turn 25, so if I don't eat by turn 25, I miss it.\n\nOn turn 24, if I am at (6,4), I can go D to (6,3) but occupied, or other, cannot go down directly.\n\nSo I might not be able to reach (6,1) or (5,1) in time for (5,1).\n\nTherefore, better to go down on turn 23 to (6,2) to be closer to food.\n\nThus, the sequence is fixed.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 22: R\n\nTurn 23: D\n\nTurn 24: D\n\nTurn 25: L\n\nThen for turn 26, I need to move, say to (4,1) or (5,2).\n\nBut since the answer should include actions, and think ahead, but for the box, I can list up to where I have.\n\nPerhaps list 5 turns: 22 to 26.\n\nTurn 26: from (5,1), move L to (4,1)\n\nThen turn 27: from (4,1), move say U to (4,2) or L to (3,1).\n\nTo be specific, I can choose L to (3,1) to go left.\n\nBut let's not overcomplicate.\n\nSince the problem says \"maximize score\", and I ate two foods, score increased by 2, and I survived.\n\nFor the answer format, I should list the actions starting from turn 22.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 22: R\n\nTurn 23: D\n\nTurn 24: D\n\nTurn 25: L\n\nAnd since 5 turns, add turn 26: L (to (4,1))\n\nBut direction: on turn 25 I moved L to (5,1), so direction L, so on turn 26, I can move L to (4,1) or U to (5,2), not R.\n\nMove L to (4,1).\n\nThen turn 27: from (4,1), direction L, so can move U, D, L (not R).\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,2), D invalid (y=1, down to y=0 wall), L to (3,1), R to (5,1) occupied.\n\nSo U or L.\n\nI can move L to (3,1).\n\nBut for the answer, list up to turn 26 or 27.\n\nI think listing 5 actions is fine: turns 22 to 26.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 22: R\n\nTurn 23: D\n\nTurn 24: D\n\nTurn 25: L\n\nTurn 26: L  // to (4,1)\n\nIn the box.\n\nTo confirm, on turn 22, moving R to (6,3) is safe, as (6,3) not occupied.\n\nThen turn 23 D to (6,2) safe.\n\nTurn 24 D to (6,1) eat.\n\nTurn 25 L to (5,1) eat.\n\nAll good.\n\nThen turn 26 L to (4,1) safe.\n\nYes.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating both positive foods while ensuring long-term survival, the actions must prioritize reaching the short-life food at (5,1) before it disappears after turn 25. The food at (6,1) has a longer life span, allowing more flexibility. After analysis, moving right (R) on turn 22 positions the snake to efficiently eat both foods by turn 25 while avoiding the dead end that occurs if moving down first. Subsequent actions focus on survival by moving towards open areas to prevent trapping.\n\n- **Turn 22**: Move R to (6,3) – This avoids immediate collision and positions the snake closer to both foods. Moving down (D) would lead to a dead end later.\n- **Turn 23**: Move D to (6,2) – Continues toward (6,1) and avoids the risk of missing (5,1) by keeping a path open.\n- **Turn 24**: Move D to (6,1) – Eats the positive food at (6,1), increasing length by 1. Life span allows this, and it sets up for the next move.\n- **Turn 25**: Move L to (5,1) – Eats the positive food at (5,1) just before it disappears after turn 25, increasing length by 1 again. Both foods are now consumed.\n- **Turn 26**: Move L to (4,1) – After eating, move left to explore the open bottom-left area, avoiding the right column which could lead to a dead end at (6,6). This ensures survival by freeing space as the tail moves.\n\nThis sequence eats both foods for a +2 score increase and maintains a safe path. Beyond turn 26, continue moving left or up to avoid collisions, as the grid has more space in the left region.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 22: R \\\\\nTurn 23: D \\\\\nTurn 24: D \\\\\nTurn 25: L \\\\\nTurn 26: L\n}",

That's 10 segments.\n\nSnake head direction is R, which is right, so moving towards increasing x.\n\nFood: two items:\n\n- (5,1) with life span 3, value +1 (since it says value1=1, and it's positive food)\n\n- (6,1) with life span 9, value +1\n\nBoth are positive food, no negative food mentioned.\n\nI need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders, so (0,y) for y=0-7, (7,y) for y=0-7, (x,0) for x=0-7, (x,7) for x=0-7. And internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nSnake: head (6,3), direction R. So current position:\n\nList all snake segments:\n\nIndex 0: (6,3) head\n\n1: (5,3)\n\n2: (4,3)\n\n3: (4,4)\n\n4: (5,4)\n\n5: (5,5)\n\n6: (4,5)\n\n7: (3,5)\n\n8: (2,5)\n\n9: (2,6) tail\n\nNow, food at (5,1) and (6,1).\n\nLife span: for (5,1) is 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn. Since current turn is 23, it will disappear after turn 25? Let's see.\n\nLife span N: disappears after N turns, countdown decreases every turn including current. So at turn 23, life span 3, so after turn 23, it has 2 turns left? Countdown decreases each turn.\n\nThe description: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at the start of turn when it's present, countdown is N. After each turn, countdown decreases by 1. When countdown reaches 0, it disappears after that turn? Or at the end?\n\nTypically, if countdown is K at turn t, after turn t it decreases to K-1. If K=1, after turn t it disappears.\n\nFor (5,1): life span 3 at turn 23. So at turn 23, countdown=3. After turn 23, countdown=2. After turn 24, countdown=1. After turn 25, countdown=0, so it disappears after turn 25, meaning it's not available on turn 26.\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) life span 9, so it will be around for a while.\n\nNow, I need to move the snake. Current head direction is R, so from (6,3), possible moves: U, D, L, R. But no instant reverse, so since current direction is R, I cannot move L (left) immediately, because that would be opposite direction.\n\nOpposite of R is L, so cannot move L.\n\nAlso, cannot move into walls or body, except tail is ok if it moves away.\n\nFirst, let's see possible moves from current position (6,3).\n\nPossible actions: U, D, R (since L is reverse, not allowed)\n\nNow, check each:\n\n- U: to (6,4)\n\n- D: to (6,2)\n\n- R: to (7,3)\n\nBut x=7 is a wall, since border cells x=7 are walls. So moving R to (7,3) is invalid, wall collision.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 and y=7 are walls, but (6,4) y=4, not border; (6,2) y=2, not border.\n\nAlso, need to check if these cells are occupied by body or obstacles.\n\nFirst, U to (6,4): is (6,4) occupied?\n\nSnake positions: (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)\n\n(6,4) is not in this list. Obstacles: (5,6) is internal, not (6,4). So (6,4) should be free.\n\nD to (6,2): (6,2) not in snake positions, not wall, not obstacle.\n\nR to (7,3): x=7 is wall, so invalid.\n\nSo possible moves: U or D.\n\nNow, I need to think about food and long-term.\n\nFood at (5,1) and (6,1), both below, since head at y=3, food at y=1.\n\n(5,1) and (6,1) are both at y=1, x=5 and x=6.\n\nBut (6,1) is directly below (6,3), since same x.\n\n(6,3) to (6,1) is down, but not adjacent, need to move down twice.\n\nCurrent position (6,3), food at (6,1) is two steps down.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1) is at x=5,y=1, which is left and down from (6,3).\n\nBut I need to eat food by moving head onto it.\n\nAlso, life span of (5,1) is short, only 3 turns including current, so it might disappear soon.\n\nAt turn 23, countdown=3 for (5,1). After turn 23, countdown=2; after turn 24, countdown=1; after turn 25, countdown=0, gone. So it can be eaten on turn 23, 24, or 25. If not eaten by turn 25, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) has life span 9, so plenty of time.\n\nNow, to eat (6,1), I need to go down to (6,2) and then to (6,1), but I have to survive.\n\nFirst, let's see if moving D to (6,2) is safe.\n\n(6,2): not occupied now, but after move, snake will move.\n\nWhen I move, the head moves to new position, and the tail moves forward, so the cell that was tail is vacated, unless I eat food.\n\nIf I don't eat food, length same, tail moves, so the end segment is removed.\n\nIf eat food, length increases, tail stays, so new segment added.\n\nBut for collision, when head moves to a cell, it should not be occupied by any body segment except possibly the tail, but if it's tail and I don't eat, it might be ok, but I need to be careful with tail reward danger.\n\nTail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut in this case, tail is at (2,6), head at (6,3), not adjacent. Far away.\n\nSo for now, not an issue.\n\nBack to moves.\n\nOption 1: Move D to (6,2) on turn 23.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (6,1) on next turn to eat the food, since (6,1) has food.\n\nBut (6,1) has food, value +1.\n\nLife span long, so I can eat it later, but since it's close, why not.\n\nBut (5,1) has short life, only 2 more turns after this? Let's clarify the turn counting.\n\nTurn 23: current turn.\n\nAfter action on turn 23, the state updates.\n\nWhen we perform action on turn t, we move, then food countdown decreases.\n\nAlso, if head moves to food cell, it eats it.\n\nFor (5,1), at turn 23, life span 3, so if not eaten, after turn 23, life span decreases to 2, and so on.\n\nTo eat (5,1), I need to be at (5,1) by turn 25 at latest.\n\nSimilarly for (6,1), by turn 31 or so, but it's easy.\n\nNow, current position (6,3), to reach (5,1), I need to go left and down.\n\nFrom (6,3), possible moves U to (6,4) or D to (6,2).\n\nIf I go U to (6,4), that's away from both foods.\n\nIf I go D to (6,2), closer to (6,1).\n\nFrom (6,2), I can go to (6,1) on next turn to eat it.\n\nBut let's see the grid and snake body to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's simulate moving D to (6,2) on turn 23.\n\nAction turn 23: D\n\nHead moves to (6,2), and since no food there, length same, tail moves from (2,6) to... the snake moves: new head at (6,2), then the body: previous head (6,3) becomes segment 1, (5,3) segment 2, and so on, up to segment 9: (2,5) becomes tail? Let's list new positions after move.\n\nCurrent positions before move: head (6,3), then (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,6)\n\nAfter move down to (6,2):\n\nNew head: (6,2)\n\nThen the body: the first body segment moves to previous head position: (6,3)\n\nThen (5,3) moves to (5,3)? No.\n\nStandard snake movement: when head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo segment 0 (head) to new position (6,2)\n\nSegment 1 (was (5,3)) moves to where segment 0 was, which is (6,3)\n\nSegment 2 (was (4,3)) moves to where segment 1 was, (5,3)\n\nSegment 3 (was (4,4)) moves to where segment 2 was, (4,3)\n\nSegment 4 (was (5,4)) moves to where segment 3 was, (4,4)\n\nSegment 5 (was (5,5)) moves to where segment 4 was, (5,4)\n\nSegment 6 (was (4,5)) moves to where segment 5 was, (5,5)\n\nSegment 7 (was (3,5)) moves to where segment 6 was, (4,5)\n\nSegment 8 (was (2,5)) moves to where segment 7 was, (3,5)\n\nSegment 9 (tail, was (2,6)) moves to where segment 8 was, (2,5)\n\nAnd since no food eaten, length same, tail is removed, so the last segment (was (2,6)) is gone, and new tail is (2,5)? Let's see the new segments:\n\nNew positions:\n\n- Head: (6,2)\n\n- Seg1: (6,3)  // previous head\n\n- Seg2: (5,3)  // previous seg1\n\n- Seg3: (4,3)  // previous seg2\n\n- Seg4: (4,4)  // previous seg3\n\n- Seg5: (5,4)  // previous seg4\n\n- Seg6: (5,5)  // previous seg5\n\n- Seg7: (4,5)  // previous seg6\n\n- Seg8: (3,5)  // previous seg7\n\n- Seg9: (2,5)  // previous seg8, and tail since length 10, segments 0 to 9.\n\nOriginal snake had 10 segments: indices 0 to 9.\n\nAfter move without eating, new snake: head at new position, and segments 1 to 9 of previous become segments 1 to 9, but shifted: segment 1 is now at position of old segment 0, segment 2 at old segment 1, ..., segment 9 at old segment 8, and old segment 9 (tail) is vacated.\n\nSo new segments:\n\n- New segment 0 (head): (6,2)\n\n- New segment 1: old seg0 position (6,3)\n\n- New segment 2: old seg1 position (5,3)\n\n- New segment 3: old seg2 position (4,3)\n\n- New segment 4: old seg3 position (4,4)\n\n- New segment 5: old seg4 position (5,4)\n\n- New segment 6: old seg5 position (5,5)\n\n- New segment 7: old seg6 position (4,5)\n\n- New segment 8: old seg7 position (3,5)\n\n- New segment 9: old seg8 position (2,5)  // since old seg9 was (2,6), but it moves to old seg8 position? No.\n\nLet's think: the body segments follow the head.\n\nWhen head moves, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment in the chain.\n\nSo for segment i, it moves to where segment i-1 was before the move.\n\nBefore move:\n\nSeg0: (6,3)\n\nSeg1: (5,3)\n\nSeg2: (4,3)\n\nSeg3: (4,4)\n\nSeg4: (5,4)\n\nSeg5: (5,5)\n\nSeg6: (4,5)\n\nSeg7: (3,5)\n\nSeg8: (2,5)\n\nSeg9: (2,6)\n\nAfter head moves to (6,2):\n\nNew seg0: (6,2)\n\nNew seg1: position of old seg0, (6,3)\n\nNew seg2: position of old seg1, (5,3)\n\nNew seg3: position of old seg2, (4,3)\n\nNew seg4: position of old seg3, (4,4)\n\nNew seg5: position of old seg4, (5,4)\n\nNew seg6: position of old seg5, (5,5)\n\nNew seg7: position of old seg6, (4,5)\n\nNew seg8: position of old seg7, (3,5)\n\nNew seg9: position of old seg8, (2,5)\n\nAnd old seg9 position (2,6) is vacated.\n\nSo new snake: [(6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nTail at (2,5).\n\nNow, on turn 24, from here, I can move to (6,1) to eat the food at (6,1).\n\nAction: D to (6,1)\n\n(6,1) has food, so I eat it.\n\nHead moves to (6,1), which is food, so length increases.\n\nNew head: (6,1)\n\nThen body: new seg1: old head (6,2)\n\nNew seg2: old seg1 (6,3)\n\n...\n\nUp to new seg10: old seg9 (2,5), but since I eat food, length increases, so tail doesn't move, new segment added at the end.\n\nAfter eating:\n\nNew head: (6,1)\n\nNew seg1: (6,2)  // previous head\n\nNew seg2: (6,3)  // previous seg1\n\nNew seg3: (5,3)  // previous seg2\n\nNew seg4: (4,3)  // previous seg3\n\nNew seg5: (4,4)  // previous seg4\n\nNew seg6: (5,4)  // previous seg5\n\nNew seg7: (5,5)  // previous seg6\n\nNew seg8: (4,5)  // previous seg7\n\nNew seg9: (3,5)  // previous seg8\n\nNew seg10: (2,5)  // previous seg9, now tail\n\nLength 11 now.\n\nFood at (6,1) is removed.\n\n(5,1) is still there, life span decreasing.\n\nBut I ate (6,1), got +1.\n\nNow, what about (5,1)? It has short life.\n\nAfter this, on turn 24, I'm at (6,1), head direction is D, since I moved down.\n\nFrom (6,1), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut no instant reverse, so since I just moved D, I cannot move U (up) immediately, because opposite.\n\nAlso, D to (6,0), but y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n\nR to (7,1), x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nL to (5,1), which has food.\n\n(5,1) is adjacent left.\n\nAnd it has food, so I can move L to (5,1) on turn 25? Turn 24 I just moved to (6,1), so on turn 25.\n\nBut (5,1) life span: at turn 23, countdown=3.\n\nAfter turn 23 action, countdown decreases to 2.\n\nAfter turn 24 action, if I eat on turn 25, countdown should be 1 or 0?\n\nLet's clarify food life span timing.\n\nAt turn t, when we perform action, after moving, if head on food, eat it.\n\nThen, after that, for all food, life span decreases by 1.\n\nThe description: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nI think after the turn, countdown decreases.\n\nAssume: at the start of turn, food has countdown C.\n\nAfter action, if head moves to food, it is eaten and removed.\n\nThen, for remaining food, countdown decreases by 1.\n\nIf countdown reaches 0, it is removed.\n\nFor (5,1) at turn 23: countdown=3.\n\nAfter turn 23 action: if not eaten, countdown decreases to 2.\n\nSimilarly, after turn 24 action: if not eaten, countdown to 1.\n\nAfter turn 25 action: if not eaten, countdown to 0, removed.\n\nIt can be eaten on turn 23, 24, or 25.\n\nIn my plan, on turn 23 I move to (6,2), not eating (5,1), so after turn 23, (5,1) countdown=2.\n\nThen on turn 24, I move to (6,1), eat (6,1), so (6,1) eaten, removed. (5,1) not eaten, so after turn 24, (5,1) countdown decreases to 1.\n\nThen on turn 25, I can move from (6,1) to (5,1) to eat it.\n\nBut from (6,1), after moving down to it, head direction is D.\n\nOn turn 25, possible moves: since last move was D (down), I cannot move U (up), opposite.\n\nD to (6,0) is wall, invalid.\n\nR to (7,1) wall, invalid.\n\nL to (5,1) is possible, and it has food.\n\nSo yes, I can move L to (5,1) on turn 25.\n\nThen eat it, get another +1.\n\nThen after that, (5,1) eaten.\n\nBut is (5,1) still available? After turn 24, countdown=1, so on turn 25, I move to it and eat before countdown decrease? Or after.\n\nTypically, when head moves to food, it eats it during the move, before countdown decrease.\n\nSo on turn 25, I move to (5,1), eat it, then after that, for other food, countdown decreases, but (5,1) is eaten, so removed.\n\nSo I can eat both foods by turn 25.\n\nBut in this sequence, I ate (6,1) on turn 24 and (5,1) on turn 25.\n\nNow, what about risks? When I move to (6,2) on turn 23, is it safe?\n\n(6,2) is free, as we saw.\n\nThen to (6,1), which is free before move, and I eat it.\n\nThen to (5,1), which should be free.\n\nBut is (5,1) occupied? Currently, snake positions after turn 24: after eating (6,1), snake is at [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\n(5,1) is not in this list, and no obstacle, so it should be free.\n\nThen moving to (5,1) on turn 25: head from (6,1) to (5,1), which is left.\n\nThen after eating, new head (5,1), body adds new segment, etc.\n\nNow, are there any body parts near? After moving to (5,1), the body is at (6,1), (6,2), etc., all above, not adjacent except (6,1) which is right, but since I move left, it should be fine.\n\n(5,1) and (6,1) are adjacent, but when I move to (5,1), the head is at (5,1), and (6,1) is the first body segment, so they are adjacent, but that's normal, not a collision, because the body follows.\n\nCollision is when head moves to a cell occupied by body, but in this case, when moving to (5,1), it was not occupied before, and after move, the body is behind, but since the head moves first, the cell is free, so no collision.\n\nOnly if the cell was occupied by body before move.\n\nHere, (5,1) was free, so ok.\n\nSo this seems safe and I get both foods.\n\nBut is there a better way? For example, can I eat (5,1) first since it has shorter life?\n\nBut (5,1) is at (5,1), from (6,3), I can't go directly to (5,1) because I can only move to adjacent cells.\n\nFrom (6,3), to reach (5,1), I need to go left and down, but in one move I can only go to (6,4), (6,2), or (7,3) invalid.\n\n(6,4) is up, (6,2) down.\n\nIf I go down to (6,2), then to (5,2) or something, but not directly to (5,1).\n\nFrom (6,2), I can go to (5,2) or (6,1) or (6,3) but (6,3) is body.\n\nAfter moving to (6,2) on turn 23, positions: [(6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nFrom (6,2), possible moves on turn 24: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut last move was D, so cannot move U (reverse).\n\nD to (6,1) as before.\n\nL to (5,2)\n\nR to (7,2) wall, invalid.\n\nSo U not allowed, D to (6,1), L to (5,2)\n\nIf I go L to (5,2) on turn 24.\n\nThen (5,2) is free? Let's see.\n\nCurrent positions: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), etc. (5,2) not occupied.\n\nNo obstacle at (5,2).\n\nSo move to (5,2).\n\nThen new positions: head to (5,2), body: seg1 to (6,2), seg2 to (6,3), seg3 to (5,3), ..., up to seg9 to (2,5), tail.\n\nNo food at (5,2), so length same, tail (2,5) removed, new tail at old seg8 position, which was (3,5) I think.\n\nAfter move to (5,2): new head (5,2), seg1 (6,2), seg2 (6,3), seg3 (5,3), seg4 (4,3), seg5 (4,4), seg6 (5,4), seg7 (5,5), seg8 (4,5), seg9 (3,5) // old seg8 was (3,5) in previous, old seg9 (2,5) vacated.\n\nPositions after turn 23: [(6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\nAfter move L to (5,2) on turn 24:\n\nNew head: (5,2)\n\nNew seg1: (6,2)  // old head\n\nNew seg2: (6,3)  // old seg1\n\nNew seg3: (5,3)  // old seg2\n\nNew seg4: (4,3)  // old seg3\n\nNew seg5: (4,4)  // old seg4\n\nNew seg6: (5,4)  // old seg5\n\nNew seg7: (5,5)  // old seg6\n\nNew seg8: (4,5)  // old seg7\n\nNew seg9: (3,5)  // old seg8, tail\n\n(2,5) vacated.\n\nNow, from (5,2), I can go to (5,1) to eat the food.\n\n(5,1) is below.\n\nHead at (5,2), direction L (since moved left).\n\nOn turn 25, possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nLast move L, so cannot move R (reverse).\n\nU to (5,3): but (5,3) is body segment, currently seg3 at (5,3), so if I move U to (5,3), it is occupied, collision.\n\nD to (5,1), which is down, and has food.\n\nL to (4,2), or R not allowed.\n\nSo I can move D to (5,1) to eat it.\n\nThen I eat (5,1) on turn 25.\n\nBut I missed (6,1), which is still there, life span 9, I can eat it later.\n\nBut in this case, I ate (5,1) on turn 25, but not (6,1) yet.\n\nCompared to first plan, I ate both by turn 25.\n\nIn first plan, I ate (6,1) on turn 24 and (5,1) on turn 25.\n\nIn this alternative, if I go to (5,2) on turn 24, then to (5,1) on turn 25, I eat (5,1) but not (6,1) immediately.\n\n(6,1) is still available, but I might not eat it directly.\n\nBut since life span long, I can get it later.\n\nBut first plan gets both quickly.\n\nMoreover, in first plan, after eating both, I have options to go elsewhere.\n\nBut let's see if there are risks.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (5,1) might be under body or something? But currently, snake is not on (5,1), and it's free.\n\nIn the state, food positions are given, and snake positions, so (5,1) is not occupied, so it can be eaten by moving to it.\n\nNow, back to the initial choice: on turn 23, I have to choose between U and D.\n\nIf I go U to (6,4), that might be away, and (5,1) might expire before I can eat it.\n\nFor example, if I go U to (6,4) on turn 23.\n\nThen positions: head to (6,4), which is free? Currently (6,4) not occupied, no obstacle.\n\nAfter move: new head (6,4), seg1 (6,3), seg2 (5,3), etc., similar to before.\n\nThen from (6,4), I can move in various directions.\n\nBut to reach (5,1), I need to go down and left, but (5,1) has only until turn 25 to be eaten.\n\nFrom (6,4), on turn 24, I can go D to (6,3), but (6,3) is body? After turn 23 move to (6,4), positions: [(6,4), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)]\n\n(6,3) is seg1, so if I move D to (6,3), it is occupied, collision.\n\nCannot go down.\n\nOther moves: U to (6,5), L to (5,4), R to (7,4) wall.\n\nR invalid.\n\nU to (6,5): (6,5) free? Not occupied, y=5<7, no wall, no obstacle.\n\nL to (5,4): (5,4) is occupied? In positions, seg5 is (5,4)? After turn 23, positions: seg0: (6,4), seg1: (6,3), seg2: (5,3), seg3: (4,3), seg4: (4,4), seg5: (5,4), yes (5,4) is seg5.\n\nSo (5,4) occupied, cannot move to it.\n\nSo from (6,4), possible moves: U to (6,5) or L? L to (5,4) occupied, not possible.\n\nOnly U to (6,5) or R invalid, D to (6,3) occupied.\n\nSo only U to (6,5).\n\nThen on turn 24, move to (6,5).\n\nThen from there, I can go to (6,6) or other, but I'm going away from food, and (5,1) will expire soon.\n\nTo reach (5,1) from (6,5) in two moves? Turn 25 is last chance to eat (5,1).\n\nFrom (6,5) on turn 24, after moving U, head direction U.\n\nOn turn 25, possible moves: U to (6,6), D to (6,4) but last move U, so cannot D (reverse), L to (5,5), R invalid.\n\nD not allowed, so U to (6,6) or L to (5,5).\n\n(5,5) is occupied? After turn 24 move to (6,5), positions: head (6,5), seg1 (6,4), seg2 (6,3), seg3 (5,3), seg4 (4,3), seg5 (4,4), seg6 (5,4), seg7 (5,5), (5,5) is seg7, so occupied.\n\nL to (5,5) occupied, collision.\n\nSo only U to (6,6), which is border? y=6, but y=7 is wall, y=6 is not wall, but (6,6) should be free.\n\nMove to (6,6).\n\nBut now I'm at (6,6), far from (5,1), and on turn 25, I need to be at (5,1) to eat, but impossible in one move.\n\n(5,1) is at distance, cannot reach by turn 25.\n\nThus, if I go up on turn 23, I miss the chance to eat (5,1), and it disappears.\n\nWhereas if I go down, I can eat both.\n\nSo going down is better.\n\nMoreover, after eating both, I have a longer snake and can explore other areas.\n\nBut I need to think about long-term survival.\n\nCurrently, after eating both foods, snake is longer.\n\nIn the first plan, after turn 25, I'm at (5,1) with length 11 or 12? Let's see.\n\nTurn 23: move D to (6,2), no eat, length 10.\n\nTurn 24: move D to (6,1), eat, length 11.\n\nTurn 25: move L to (5,1), eat, length 12.\n\nNow at (5,1), head direction L.\n\nNow, possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut last move L, so cannot R (reverse).\n\nU to (5,2), D to (5,0) but y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nL to (4,1), R not allowed.\n\nSo only U or L.\n\n(5,2): after move to (5,1), positions: head (5,1), seg1 (6,1) // previous head, seg2 (6,2), seg3 (6,3), seg4 (5,3), seg5 (4,3), seg6 (4,4), seg7 (5,4), seg8 (5,5), seg9 (4,5), seg10 (3,5), seg11 (2,5) // since ate on turn 25.\n\nAfter turn 25 eat (5,1): head (5,1), seg1 (6,1), seg2 (6,2), seg3 (6,3), seg4 (5,3), seg5 (4,3), seg6 (4,4), seg7 (5,4), seg8 (5,5), seg9 (4,5), seg10 (3,5), seg11 (2,5)\n\nNow, (5,2) is not occupied, so I can move U to (5,2).\n\nL to (4,1), which should be free.\n\nNow, I need to think beyond to turn 26, etc.\n\nBut since the problem asks to think 5+ turns ahead, and plan multiple turns.\n\nAlso, there might be risks or opportunities.\n\nAnother thing: internal obstacle at (5,6), which is not near now.\n\nAnd walls.\n\nCurrently, after eating, I'm at bottom left, with body above.\n\nTo survive, I need to avoid trapping myself.\n\nFor example, from (5,1), if I go up to (5,2), then I can go to (5,3) but (5,3) is seg4, occupied.\n\nOr left to (4,1), or right but not allowed immediately.\n\nPerhaps I should go left to open area.\n\nThe grid: let's see free cells.\n\nBut I don't need to plan all, just for the answer, I need to output actions for several turns, but the format says \"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ... }\"\n\nIt doesn't specify how many turns, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide at least 5 turns of actions if possible.\n\nCurrent turn t1=23.\n\nSo I can plan for turns 23 to 27 or so.\n\nIn my first plan, turns 23,24,25 are set: D, D, L to eat both foods.\n\nThen for turn 26 and beyond, I need to decide.\n\nAfter turn 25, at (5,1), head direction L.\n\nOptions: U to (5,2) or L to (4,1).\n\nIf I go U to (5,2), then from (5,2), last move U, so cannot D.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,3), but (5,3) is seg4, occupied.\n\nL to (4,2), R to (6,2) but R is reverse? Last move U, so opposite is D, not R. Directions: U and D opposite, L and R opposite.\n\nLast move U, so cannot D, but L and R are ok.\n\nR to (6,2): (6,2) is seg2, occupied.\n\nIn positions: seg2 is (6,2), so occupied.\n\nL to (4,2): (4,2) may be free.\n\nU to (5,3) occupied.\n\nD not allowed.\n\nSo only L to (4,2) or R to (6,2) occupied, so only L to (4,2) possible? (4,2) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, if from (5,1) I go L to (4,1) first.\n\n(4,1) should be free.\n\nThen from there, I can go U, D, L, R.\n\nBut last move L, so cannot R.\n\nD to (4,0) wall, invalid.\n\nU to (4,2), L to (3,1), R not allowed.\n\nSo U or L.\n\nNow, to avoid dead ends, going left might be better to open area.\n\nThe snake body is mostly on the right, so left side might have space.\n\nFor example, x from 0 to 7, y 0 to 7.\n\nSnake has segments around (5,1) to (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), etc., so area x=2-6, y=1-5 roughly.\n\nLeft side x=0-3, y=0-7 might be free, except walls.\n\nBut y=0 wall, x=0 wall.\n\nFor instance, (4,1) is free, (3,1), (2,1), etc.\n\nSimilarly, up to (0,1) wall.\n\nAlso, (1,1), (1,2), etc.\n\nSince I need to survive, I should move towards open spaces.\n\nBut for now, in the short term, going down to eat the foods is good.\n\nMoreover, with the life span, (5,1) must be eaten soon.\n\nSo I think the plan to go D on turn 23 is best.\n\nThen D on turn 24 to eat (6,1).\n\nThen L on turn 25 to eat (5,1).\n\nNow for turn 26, from (5,1), head direction L (since moved left on turn 25).\n\nSo cannot move R.\n\nCan move U, D, L.\n\nD to (5,0) invalid wall.\n\nSo U to (5,2) or L to (4,1).\n\nNow, (5,2) might be free, but after moving to (5,1), positions include (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), so (5,2) is not occupied, should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,1) free.\n\nIf I go U to (5,2), then as before, from (5,2), I can only go L to (4,2) or U to (5,3) occupied, so must go L to (4,2).\n\nThen from (4,2), etc.\n\nIf I go L to (4,1) first, then to (4,2) or (3,1), etc.\n\nTo have more space, going left might be better.\n\nFor example, to (4,1), then I can go up to (4,2) or left to (3,1).\n\n(3,1) should be free, since snake is at (3,5) etc., not near.\n\nSimilarly, (2,1), (1,1), but x=0 wall.\n\nBut I can explore.\n\nSince I need to output actions, I can specify up to turn 27 or 28.\n\nBut let's see the food: only two foods, both eaten by turn 25, so no more food mentioned. But there might be new food spawning later, but not specified, so I think only these two for now.\n\nThe state only gives current food, so I have to assume no new food for the planning, or that I need to survive.\n\nBut to maximize score, since no more food, I just need to survive, but score is from eating food, so if no food, no score, but I should avoid dying.\n\nBut in this case, after eating, I need to move safely.\n\nAlso, the tail is at (2,5), which might move.\n\nBut let's plan the moves.\n\nSo for turn 23: D\n\nTurn 24: D\n\nTurn 25: L\n\nNow turn 26: from (5,1), I need to choose.\n\nTo have more options, let's go L to (4,1).\n\nAction: L\n\nThen head to (4,1), no food, so length 12, tail moves.\n\nPrevious tail was (2,5), now moves.\n\nAfter turn 25: positions as above.\n\nAfter move L to (4,1) on turn 26: no eat, so new head (4,1), seg1 (5,1), seg2 (6,1), seg3 (6,2), seg4 (6,3), seg5 (5,3), seg6 (4,3), seg7 (4,4), seg8 (5,4), seg9 (5,5), seg10 (4,5), seg11 (3,5), and tail was (2,5), but since no eat, it moves to where seg11 was? Seg11 was (3,5), but in the chain.\n\nBefore move: head (5,1), seg1 (6,1), seg2 (6,2), seg3 (6,3), seg4 (5,3), seg5 (4,3), seg6 (4,4), seg7 (5,4), seg8 (5,5), seg9 (4,5), seg10 (3,5), seg11 (2,5)\n\nAfter move to (4,1): new head (4,1), new seg1 (5,1), new seg2 (6,1), new seg3 (6,2), new seg4 (6,3), new seg5 (5,3), new seg6 (4,3), new seg7 (4,4), new seg8 (5,4), new seg9 (5,5), new seg10 (4,5), new seg11 (3,5)\n\nAnd (2,5) vacated.\n\nNow at (4,1), head direction L (since moved left).\n\nTurn 27: possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nLast move L, cannot R (reverse).\n\nD to (4,0) wall, invalid.\n\nU to (4,2), L to (3,1)\n\nR not allowed.\n\nSo U to (4,2) or L to (3,1).\n\n(4,2) should be free, (3,1) free.\n\nSay I go U to (4,2).\n\nThen from there, etc.\n\nBut I need to output actions, so for the answer, since the immediate actions are clear, I can output turns 23 to 25, but the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should provide more turns.\n\nPerhaps up to turn 27 or 28.\n\nBut let's see if there is any danger.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (5,6), not near.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger, but tail is at (3,5), head at (4,1) after turn 26, not adjacent.\n\nSo safe.\n\nNow, to keep it simple, I can go towards the left.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 26: L to (4,1)\n\nThen turn 27: from (4,1), go U to (4,2) or L to (3,1).\n\n(4,2) might be better to go up.\n\nThen from (4,2), I can go to (4,3) but (4,3) is seg6, occupied, or to (3,2), etc.\n\nBut I don't need to detail.\n\nSince the food is handled, and survival is key, any safe move is fine.\n\nBut for the answer, I can specify:\n\nTurn 23: D\n\nTurn 24: D\n\nTurn 25: L\n\nThen for turn 26, say L to (4,1)\n\nTurn 27: U to (4,2)\n\nBut I need to think if this is optimal, but since no food, it should be ok.\n\nTo think 5 turns ahead, from turn 23 to 27.\n\nTurns: 23,24,25,26,27.\n\nActions: 23:D, 24:D, 25:L, 26:L, 27:U\n\nBut on turn 26, from (5,1), I could go U to (5,2) instead of L.\n\nBut (5,2) might lead to less space.\n\nFor example, if I go U to (5,2) on turn 26.\n\nThen from (5,2), last move U, so cannot D.\n\nPossible: U to (5,3) but occupied (seg5? After turn 25, seg5 is (4,3), but (5,3) is seg4, which is occupied.\n\nPositions after turn 25: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nSo (5,3) is seg4, occupied.\n\nSo from (5,2), if I move there on turn 26, but (5,2) is free, move to it.\n\nThen new positions: head (5,2), seg1 (5,1), seg2 (6,1), seg3 (6,2), seg4 (6,3), seg5 (5,3), etc., and tail (2,5) vacated or moved.\n\nAfter move to (5,2) no eat: new head (5,2), seg1 (5,1), seg2 (6,1), seg3 (6,2), seg4 (6,3), seg5 (5,3), seg6 (4,3), seg7 (4,4), seg8 (5,4), seg9 (5,5), seg10 (4,5), seg11 (3,5)\n\n(2,5) gone.\n\nNow at (5,2), direction U (since moved up).\n\nThen turn 27: moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nCannot D (reverse).\n\nU to (5,3): occupied by seg5 (5,3), collision.\n\nL to (4,2), R to (6,2) but (6,2) is seg3, occupied.\n\nSo only possible L to (4,2), if free.\n\n(4,2) should be free.\n\nSo I must go L to (4,2).\n\nThen same as before.\n\nWhereas if from (5,1) I go L to (4,1) on turn 26, then to (4,2) or (3,1), I have more options.\n\nFor example, from (4,1), I can go to (3,1) or (4,2).\n\nIf go to (3,1), then to (3,2) or (2,1), etc., more space.\n\nSo to avoid being trapped, better to go left first.\n\nThus, for turn 26: L to (4,1)\n\nThen turn 27: from (4,1), I can go U to (4,2) or L to (3,1).\n\nSay go U to (4,2) for now.\n\nThen from (4,2), I can go to (4,3) but occupied, or (3,2), or (5,2), etc.\n\nBut (4,3) is seg6, occupied after turn 26? After turn 26 move to (4,1), positions: head (4,1), seg1 (5,1), seg2 (6,1), seg3 (6,2), seg4 (6,3), seg5 (5,3), seg6 (4,3), etc.\n\nSo (4,3) is seg6, occupied.\n\nFrom (4,2) on turn 27, last move U, so cannot D.\n\nMoves: U to (4,3) occupied, D not allowed, L to (3,2), R to (5,2)\n\n(5,2) may be free or not.\n\nAfter turn 26, positions include (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), so (5,2) not occupied, should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) free.\n\nSo I can go L or R.\n\nBut R to (5,2) is towards the body, might be riskier, L to (3,2) away.\n\nSo better L to (3,2).\n\nBut I think for the answer, since no food, I can stop at turn 25 or go a bit further.\n\nPerhaps the minimal is to provide the critical actions.\n\nBut to satisfy \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should provide 5 actions: turns 23 to 27.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 23: D (down)\n\nTurn 24: D (down)\n\nTurn 25: L (left)\n\nTurn 26: L (left) to (4,1)\n\nTurn 27: U (up) to (4,2) or something, but I need to specify.\n\nTo be consistent, after turn 25 at (5,1), go L to (4,1) on turn 26.\n\nThen on turn 27, from (4,1), go U to (4,2).\n\nThen on turn 28, from (4,2), I can go L to (3,2) or U to (4,3) occupied, so L to (3,2), etc.\n\nBut for 5 turns, turns 23 to 27: 23,24,25,26,27.\n\nActions: D, D, L, L, U\n\nBut on turn 27, U from (4,1) to (4,2).\n\nYes.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I can write the actions.\n\nNow, about the tail reward danger, but not relevant now.\n\nAlso, food under body: but no food under body now.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nBut in the initial, when I move to (6,2) on turn 23, is there any risk? (6,2) is free, and after move, the body is behind.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo I think the plan is safe and gets both foods before (5,1) expires.\n\nThus, the actions should be:\n\nTurn 23: D\n\nTurn 24: D\n\nTurn 25: L\n\nFor the boxed answer, I need to write it.\n\nBut the format says \"Turn t1: action\", etc.\n\nt1=23.\n\nAlso, directions: U, D, L, R.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 23: \\text{D}, \\text{Turn } 24: \\text{D}, \\text{Turn } 25: \\text{L} }\n\nBut I need more turns? Think 5+ ahead, so perhaps up to turn 27 or 28.\n\nSince turn 23 to 25 is 3 turns, I should add two more.\n\nTurn 26: L (to (4,1))\n\nTurn 27: U (to (4,2))\n\nBut from (4,1), U to (4,2) is possible.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nAfter turn 25, at (5,1), head direction L, so on turn 26, I move L to (4,1), direction L.\n\nThen turn 27, from (4,1), last move L, so cannot R, D invalid, so U or L.\n\nI chose U.\n\nSimilarly, I can add turn 28 if needed, but 5 actions should be fine.\n\nTurns 23,24,25,26,27: that's 5 actions.\n\nSo:\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 23: \\text{D}, \\text{Turn } 24: \\text{D}, \\text{Turn } 25: \\text{L}, \\text{Turn } 26: \\text{L}, \\text{Turn } 27: \\text{U} }\n\nBut on turn 26, moving L to (4,1) is safe, and turn 27 U to (4,2) safe.\n\nYes.\n\nTo confirm, is there a better immediate move? For example, on turn 23, if I go U, I miss the food, so worse.\n\nSo this should be optimal.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating the positive food at (6,1) and (5,1) while prioritizing long-term survival, the snake must eat (5,1) before its life span expires after turn 25. The current state (turn 23) allows the snake to move down to (6,2) safely, setting up a path to eat both foods by turn 25. Moving up on turn 23 would risk missing (5,1) due to its short life span (countdown 3 at turn 23, disappearing after turn 25 if not eaten).\n\nAfter eating both foods, the snake must navigate safely to avoid collisions. Moving left from (5,1) on turn 26 and then up on turn 27 opens up space toward the left side of the grid, where fewer body segments are present, reducing collision risk and supporting long-term survival.\n\n### Planned Actions (5 turns ahead, turns 23 to 27):\n- **Turn 23**: Move down (D) to (6,2). This avoids the wall at (7,3) and the reverse move (left), positions the snake closer to (6,1), and keeps (5,1) accessible. (6,2) is free and safe.\n- **Turn 24**: Move down (D) to (6,1) to eat the positive food (+1 score, length increases to 11). (6,1) is free, and the move is valid (no reverse from down).\n- **Turn 25**: Move left (L) to (5,1) to eat the positive food (+1 score, length increases to 12). (5,1) is free, and this eats it before it expires (countdown 1 after turn 24, eaten on turn 25).\n- **Turn 26**: Move left (L) to (4,1). This moves away from the dense body area around x=5-6 and toward open space on the left. (4,1) is free and safe, with no immediate collision risk.\n- **Turn 27**: Move up (U) to (4,2). This continues exploration into open space, avoiding the wall at (4,0) and the reverse move (right). (4,2) is free and safe.\n\n### Why this plan?\n- **Scores both foods**: Eats (6,1) on turn 24 and (5,1) on turn 25, maximizing immediate score (+2 total) before (5,1) expires.\n- **Avoids risks**: \n  - No wall or body collisions during the plan.\n  - Tail reward danger is irrelevant (tail at (2,5) or (3,5) is not adjacent to head).\n  - After turn 25, moving left and up avoids trapping the snake in the bottom-left corner and leverages open space for survival.\n- **Long-term focus**: By turn 27, the snake is at (4,2) with access to cells like (3,2), (4,3), or (5,2) for future moves, maintaining flexibility. The grid has space on the left (x=0-3, y=1-6) for continued survival.\n- **Life span handling**: (5,1) life span is respected (eaten on turn 25 with countdown 1); (6,1) life span 9 allows eating on turn 24.\n\nThis plan thinks 5 turns ahead, ensuring the snake survives beyond the immediate food consumption.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{Turn } 23: \\text{D}, \\text{Turn } 24: \\text{D}, \\text{Turn } 25: \\text{L}, \\text{Turn } 26: \\text{L}, \\text{Turn } 27: \\text{U}}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game. It's turn 24, and I have to plan my moves for the next few turns, thinking at least 5 steps ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nThe grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (5,6). So the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, except for (5,6) which is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: head at (6,2), then (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5). So the snake is 10 segments long. Head direction is down, which means it was moving down to get to (6,2) from (6,3)? Let's see the positions: from head to tail: (6,2) is head, then (6,3), which is above it, so if head is at (6,2) and previous was (6,3), that means it moved down from (6,3) to (6,2), so direction down makes sense.\n\nNow, food:\n\n- (5,1) with value 1 and life span 2. Since life span decreases every turn, including current, and current turn is 24, it will disappear after turn 25? Life span 2 means it will be there for 2 more turns including this one? Let's clarify.\n\nFrom the rules: \"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for food at (5,1) with life span 2 on turn 24: it will disappear after turn 25? Countdown decreases every turn, including current. So on turn 24, life span is 2, meaning it has 2 turns left: turn 24 and turn 25. After turn 25, it disappears. Similarly, on turn 25, life span becomes 1, and after turn 25, it's gone.\n\nSimilarly, food at (6,1) with value 1 and life span 8: it will last until turn 31, since 24 + 8 - 1 = 31? Let's think carefully.\n\nIf life span is N on turn T, it will be present on turns T, T+1, ..., T+N-1, and disappear after turn T+N-1. For example, life span 2 on turn 24: present on turn 24 and 25, gone on turn 26.\n\nLife span 8 on turn 24: present on turns 24 to 31, gone on turn 32.\n\nBut we're planning from turn 24 onwards.\n\nNow, the snake head is at (6,2), direction down. Possible moves: since direction is down, I can move down, left, or right, but not up because that would be instant reverse. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\"\n\nCurrent direction is down, so opposite is up. So I cannot move up on this turn. I can move down, left, or right.\n\nNow, coordinates: let's sketch the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, but walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable area: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,6), so (5,6) is blocked.\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- Head: (6,2)\n\n- Body: (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nSo let's list all occupied cells:\n\n- (6,2) - head\n\n- (6,3) - body\n\n- (5,3) - body\n\n- (4,3) - body\n\n- (4,4) - body\n\n- (5,4) - body\n\n- (5,5) - body\n\n- (4,5) - body\n\n- (3,5) - body\n\n- (2,5) - tail\n\nFood: (5,1) and (6,1)\n\n(5,1) is at x=5, y=1, which is bottom row? y=0 is wall, y=1 is the bottom playable row.\n\ny=0 is wall, y=1 to y=6 playable, y=7 wall. So y=1 is the lowest row.\n\nSimilarly, x=0 left wall, x=7 right wall.\n\nSo (6,1) is bottom-right corner? x=6, y=1.\n\nx=6 is rightmost playable, y=1 bottom.\n\n(5,1) is left of that, x=5, y=1.\n\nSnake head at (6,2), which is above (6,1).\n\nCurrent head position: (6,2)\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Down: to (6,1) - but (6,1) has food? (6,1) is a food position with value 1.\n\n- Left: to (5,2)\n\n- Right: not possible, x=7 is wall, so right from (6,2) would be (7,2), which is wall, invalid.\n\nx=6 is max, so right is invalid.\n\nUp: but direction is down, so up is reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo only possible moves: down or left.\n\nDown to (6,1) or left to (5,2).\n\nNow, (6,1) has food, positive, value 1.\n\nBut I need to think about risks and long-term.\n\nAlso, there's food at (5,1), which is close.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving down to (6,1).\n\nIf I move down to (6,1), I eat the food there. Since it's positive food, snake length increases by 1. So after eating, snake grows, so new positions: head moves to (6,1), and the tail doesn't move yet? When you eat, the tail stays for that turn, so the snake grows immediately.\n\nRule: \"Length of snake +1\" when eating positive food.\n\nSo when head moves to a food cell, it eats it, and the snake grows, meaning that after the move, the tail doesn't move; a new segment is added at the tail position.\n\nStandard Snake mechanics: when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, and the tail doesn't move, so the snake gets longer by one cell.\n\nIn terms of positions: before move, snake has segments S0 (head), S1, S2, ..., S9 (tail) for 10 segments.\n\nAfter moving head to new position and eating, new head is the new position, and the tail remains, so new segments: new head, then S0, S1, ..., S9, so 11 segments.\n\nBut in this case, moving to (6,1) which has food.\n\n(6,1) is currently not occupied by snake body, I think. Let's check occupied cells.\n\nSnake positions: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nSo (6,1) is not in this list, and not wall, so it's free, with food.\n\nSimilarly, (5,1) is also free.\n\nFood can spawn under body, but in this case, (6,1) and (5,1) are not under snake, I think.\n\n(6,1) is empty, (5,1) empty.\n\nBut (6,1) has food.\n\nIf I move down to (6,1), I eat the food, snake grows to 11 segments.\n\nBut then, after eating, the tail position stays, so the new tail is still (2,5), I think? Let's clarify.\n\nAfter moving head to (6,1), since it ate food, the tail doesn't move, so positions become: head (6,1), then previous head (6,2) becomes segment 1, then (6,3), (5,3), etc., up to (2,5) as segment 10, and since it grew, the tail stays, so (2,5) is still there, but now it's segment 10 of 11? Let's index.\n\nBefore move: positions: [ (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) ] 10 segments, index 0 to 9.\n\nAfter moving down to (6,1) and eating:\n\n- New head: (6,1)\n\n- Then the previous segments: (6,2), (6,3), ..., (2,5) all remain, so now 11 segments: [ (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) ]\n\nTail is still (2,5).\n\nNow, direction: since I moved down, new head direction is down.\n\nBut after eating, I need to consider the next moves.\n\nNow, the other option is moving left to (5,2).\n\n(5,2) is empty? Let's see if it's occupied.\n\nSnake positions: (6,2) head, (6,3), etc. (5,2) not in list, not wall, so free, no food.\n\nIf I move left to (5,2), no food eaten, so snake moves normally: head to (5,2), then each segment moves to previous position, so tail (2,5) is removed.\n\nNew positions: [ (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) ] and (2,5) is gone, so 9 segments? Before 10 segments, after move without eating, head moves, tail moves off.\n\nPositions: old: [H: (6,2), B1: (6,3), B2: (5,3), B3: (4,3), B4: (4,4), B5: (5,4), B6: (5,5), B7: (4,5), B8: (3,5), T: (2,5)]\n\nAfter moving left to (5,2): new head (5,2), then B1 becomes (6,2) (previous head), B2 becomes (6,3), B3 becomes (5,3), B4 becomes (4,3), B5 becomes (4,4), B6 becomes (5,4), B7 becomes (5,5), B8 becomes (4,5), T becomes (3,5). (2,5) is removed.\n\nSo new positions: [ (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) ] 10 segments? Let's count: head, then 9 body, but indices: 0: (5,2), 1: (6,2), 2: (6,3), 3: (5,3), 4: (4,3), 5: (4,4), 6: (5,4), 7: (5,5), 8: (4,5), 9: (3,5) — that's 10 segments. Original was 10, after move without eating, it should be 10, but tail moved from (2,5) to (3,5), so (2,5) free now.\n\nIn this case, no food, so length unchanged.\n\nNow back to decision.\n\nIf I move down to (6,1), I eat food, get +1 score, length 11.\n\nBut there's a risk: Tail Reward Danger.\n\nRule: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nIn this case, when I eat the food at (6,1), the tail is at (2,5), which is far away, not adjacent. Head at (6,1), tail at (2,5), not adjacent. So no danger from that.\n\nAfter eating, positions as above.\n\nBut now, the food at (5,1) has life span 2, so it will disappear after turn 25. Current turn 24, so on turn 25 it's still there, but after turn 25 it's gone.\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) is eaten, so gone.\n\nNow, after moving to (6,1), head is at (6,1), direction down.\n\nFrom (6,1), possible moves: down not possible, y=0 wall. Left to (5,1), which has food. Right not possible, wall. Up to (6,2), but (6,2) is now the second segment, so it's body, collision if I move there.\n\nCurrent positions after eating: head (6,1), then (6,2), (6,3), etc.\n\nSo from (6,1), moving up to (6,2) would hit the body at (6,2), death.\n\nMoving left to (5,1): (5,1) has food, and it's free, no body there.\n\nMoving down: y=1, down to (6,0), but y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nRight: x=6, right to (7,1), x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is left to (5,1).\n\nThen I eat the food at (5,1), positive, so snake grows again.\n\nAfter eating, positions: new head (5,1), then previous head (6,1), then (6,2), (6,3), ..., up to (2,5), but since I ate, tail stays, so (2,5) still tail.\n\nLet's list: before move to (5,1), positions: [ (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) ] 11 segments.\n\nAfter moving left to (5,1) and eating: new head (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) — 12 segments, tail (2,5).\n\nNow, head at (5,1), direction left (since moved left from (6,1)).\n\nPossible moves: from (5,1), can move up, down, left, right? But no instant reverse.\n\nDirection is left, so cannot move right (opposite).\n\nDown not possible, y=1, down to (5,0) wall.\n\nUp to (5,2): (5,2) is now body? Current positions: after move, head (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), etc.\n\n(5,2) is not in the positions? Positions: (5,1) head, (6,1) segment 1, (6,2) segment 2, (6,3) segment 3, (5,3) segment 4, etc. So (5,2) is free? Let's see if (5,2) is occupied.\n\nIn the list: segments are (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5). So (5,2) not in list, so free.\n\nSimilarly, left to (4,1)? x=4,y=1.\n\nBut is there a wall? Walls only borders and (5,6), so (4,1) should be free.\n\nx=4,y=1, not wall, not in positions.\n\nRight to (6,1) but that's body, collision.\n\nSo from (5,1), possible moves: up to (5,2), or left to (4,1), or down invalid, right invalid (opposite and body).\n\nDirection left, so right is opposite, invalid.\n\nSo up or left.\n\nBut if I move up to (5,2), no food, or left to (4,1), no food.\n\nAfter eating both foods, the area is a bit cramped.\n\nBut let's think long-term.\n\nThe food at (5,1) has life span 2, meaning it disappears after turn 25. Turn 24: life span 2, present turn 24 and 25, gone turn 26.\n\nIf on turn 24 I move left to (5,2) instead of down, I don't eat (6,1) yet.\n\nThen on turn 25, I might eat (5,1) or something.\n\nBut let's plan multiple turns.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible moves from current state.\n\nCurrent turn 24, head at (6,2), direction down.\n\nPossible actions: down to (6,1) or left to (5,2).\n\nCase 1: Move down to (6,1) on turn 24.\n\n- Eat food at (6,1), score +1, length 11.\n\n- New positions: head (6,1), body: (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) tail.\n\n- Direction: down.\n\nNow turn 25: from (6,1), only possible move is left to (5,1), as other moves invalid.\n\nMove left to (5,1), eat food there (value 1, life span 2, but on turn 25, life span decreases to 1, but still there).\n\nEat, score +1, total score +2.\n\nNew positions: head (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) — 12 segments.\n\nDirection left.\n\nNow turn 26: from (5,1), possible moves:\n\n- Up to (5,2): (5,2) is free? Current positions: head (5,1), seg1 (6,1), seg2 (6,2), seg3 (6,3), seg4 (5,3), seg5 (4,3), seg6 (4,4), seg7 (5,4), seg8 (5,5), seg9 (4,5), seg10 (3,5), seg11 (2,5) tail.\n\n(5,2) not occupied, no wall, no food.\n\n- Left to (4,1): (4,1) not occupied, no wall, no food.\n\n- Down: invalid, wall.\n\n- Right: to (6,1), but (6,1) is seg1, body, collision. Also, direction left, right is opposite, invalid anyway.\n\nSo can move up or left.\n\nSuppose I move up to (5,2).\n\nNo food, so snake moves, tail moves off.\n\nNew positions: head to (5,2), then seg1 to (5,1), seg2 to (6,1), seg3 to (6,2), seg4 to (6,3), seg5 to (5,3), seg6 to (4,3), seg7 to (4,4), seg8 to (5,4), seg9 to (5,5), seg10 to (4,5), seg11 to (3,5), and tail (2,5) removed? Since no eat, tail moves.\n\nOld tail (2,5) removed, new tail is the last segment.\n\nAfter moving head to (5,2) without eating: new head (5,2), then previous head (5,1) becomes seg1, (6,1) seg2, (6,2) seg3, (6,3) seg4, (5,3) seg5, (4,3) seg6, (4,4) seg7, (5,4) seg8, (5,5) seg9, (4,5) seg10, (3,5) seg11? Positions before move: 12 segments.\n\nAfter move: head moves to (5,2), then each body segment moves to previous position, so the last segment (tail) is removed.\n\nSo new positions: [ (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5) ] and (3,5) removed? Let's list:\n\n- New head: (5,2)\n\n- Then seg1: previous head (5,1)\n\n- Seg2: previous seg1 (6,1)\n\n- Seg3: previous seg2 (6,2)\n\n- Seg4: previous seg3 (6,3)\n\n- Seg5: previous seg4 (5,3)\n\n- Seg6: previous seg5 (4,3)\n\n- Seg7: previous seg6 (4,4)\n\n- Seg8: previous seg7 (5,4)\n\n- Seg9: previous seg8 (5,5)\n\n- Seg10: previous seg9 (4,5)\n\n- Seg11: previous seg10 (3,5) — but since no eat, the tail segment is removed, so we have only up to previous seg10? Original had indices 0 to 11, 12 segments.\n\nAfter move without eating, new head position, then segments 1 to 11 become the new body, but segment 11 was the tail, and since no growth, the tail is removed, so new snake has positions: new head, then old seg0 to seg10? Standard: the snake moves, so the head goes to new cell, each segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail position is vacated.\n\nSo for segments: let S be the list.\n\nAfter move to new cell C without eating: new head C, then S[0], S[1], ..., S[n-2], so length n, but S[n-1] is removed.\n\nIn this case, before move, S = [ (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) ] head at index 0: (5,1)\n\nMove to (5,2), no eat, so new head (5,2), then new body: old S[0] to S[10], but S[10] is (3,5), S[11] is (2,5) tail.\n\nNew positions: head (5,2), then old head S[0] = (5,1) becomes new seg1, old seg1 S[1] = (6,1) becomes new seg2, old seg2 S[2] = (6,2) becomes new seg3, ..., up to old seg10 S[10] = (3,5) becomes new seg11? And old tail S[11] = (2,5) is removed.\n\nSince no growth, the new snake has one less segment? No.\n\nBefore move: 12 segments, after move without eating: 12 segments, but the last position is removed.\n\nPositions: new head at (5,2), then the first 11 positions of the old body become the new body, but the old body has 11 segments from S[1] to S[11], but S[1] to S[11] are 11 segments, plus new head, 12 segments, but the tail moves.\n\nOld: S[0] to S[11], 12 elements.\n\nAfter move to C without eating: new head C, then new seg1 = old S[0], new seg2 = old S[1], ..., new seg12 = old S[11]? But that would be 13 segments, which is wrong.\n\nI think I have a confusion.\n\nStandard: when no eat, the head moves to a new cell, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail cell is left empty. The number of segments remains the same.\n\nFor example, old positions: H, B1, B2, ..., T\n\nAfter moving head to new position N, no eat: new head N, then B1 moves to H's position, B2 to B1's position, ..., T moves to the position of the segment before it, and the old T position is vacated.\n\nSo new positions: N (new head), old H (now body), old B1, old B2, ..., old T_minus_one, and the old T is gone.\n\nThe new tail is the segment that was second last.\n\nIn terms of list: if positions are [P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk] with P0 head, Pk tail.\n\nAfter move to new cell C without eating: new positions [C, P0, P1, P2, ..., P_{k-1}], so the tail Pk is removed, and the new list has k+1 elements? No.\n\n[C, P0, P1, P2, ..., P_{k-1}] has (k+1) elements, but originally k+1 elements from P0 to Pk.\n\nP0 to Pk is k+1 segments.\n\nAfter move: new head C, then P0 becomes new body1, P1 becomes new body2, ..., P_{k-1} becomes new bodyk, and Pk is removed. So new positions: [C, P0, P1, P2, ..., P_{k-1}], which has k+1 segments, same as before.\n\nIn the example, before move to (5,2), positions: [ (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) ] 12 segments.\n\nAfter move to (5,2) no eat: new head (5,2), then old head (5,1) becomes new body1, old body1 (6,1) becomes new body2, old body2 (6,2) becomes new body3, old body3 (6,3) becomes new body4, old body4 (5,3) becomes new body5, old body5 (4,3) becomes new body6, old body6 (4,4) becomes new body7, old body7 (5,4) becomes new body8, old body8 (5,5) becomes new body9, old body9 (4,5) becomes new body10, old body10 (3,5) becomes new body11, and old tail (2,5) is removed. So new positions: [ (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) ] 12 segments, new tail at (3,5).\n\nSimilarly, if I had moved left to (4,1), similar thing.\n\nBut in this case, from (5,1) on turn 26, if I move up to (5,2), no food, positions as above.\n\nThen head at (5,2), direction up (since moved up from (5,1)).\n\nThen possible moves, etc.\n\nBut this is getting messy. I should consider the other initial choice.\n\nBack to turn 24, if I move left to (5,2) instead.\n\nTurn 24: move left to (5,2), no food eaten.\n\nNew positions: head (5,2), then old head (6,2) becomes body, old body1 (6,3) becomes next, etc., old tail (2,5) removed.\n\nOld positions: [H: (6,2), B1: (6,3), B2: (5,3), B3: (4,3), B4: (4,4), B5: (5,4), B6: (5,5), B7: (4,5), B8: (3,5), T: (2,5)]\n\nAfter move to (5,2) no eat: new head (5,2), then B1 = (6,2) (old head), B2 = (6,3) (old B1), B3 = (5,3) (old B2), B4 = (4,3) (old B3), B5 = (4,4) (old B4), B6 = (5,4) (old B5), B7 = (5,5) (old B6), B8 = (4,5) (old B7), T = (3,5) (old B8), and old T (2,5) removed.\n\nNew positions: [ (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) ] 10 segments, tail at (3,5).\n\nDirection left (since moved left from (6,2)).\n\nNow turn 25: head at (5,2), direction left.\n\nFood available: (5,1) with life span 2, on turn 25, life span decreases to 1, so it will disappear after this turn, so I must eat it now or lose it.\n\n(6,1) has life span 8, plenty of time.\n\nFrom (5,2), possible moves:\n\n- Down to (5,1): (5,1) has food, and it's free.\n\n- Up to (5,3): but (5,3) is body? Current positions: head (5,2), then (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), etc. So (5,3) is the fourth segment, body, so if I move up to (5,3), collision.\n\n- Left to (4,2): (4,2) not occupied, no wall, no food.\n\n- Right to (6,2): (6,2) is body, collision. Also, direction left, right is opposite, invalid.\n\nSo possible moves: down to (5,1) or left to (4,2).\n\nIf I move down to (5,1), I eat the food, score +1, length 11.\n\nNew positions: head (5,1), then (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) and since ate, tail stays, so (3,5) still tail, 11 segments.\n\nDirection down.\n\nThen turn 26: from (5,1), direction down? But down to (5,0) wall, invalid.\n\nPossible moves: up to (5,2), but (5,2) is now body (second segment), collision.\n\nLeft to (4,1): (4,1) not occupied, no wall, no food.\n\nRight to (6,1): (6,1) has food, and it's free, no body.\n\nAlso, direction down, so up is opposite? Current direction down, so moving up would be reverse, not allowed.\n\nDirection is down, so cannot move up.\n\nSo possible moves: left to (4,1) or right to (6,1).\n\nIf I move right to (6,1), I eat the food there, score +1, total +2.\n\nThen new positions: head (6,1), then (5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) — 12 segments, tail (3,5).\n\nDirection right.\n\nThen from there, I can move up or something.\n\nBut let's compare the two scenarios.\n\nIn the first choice (move down on turn 24), I ate both foods immediately on turn 24 and 25, score +2, but the snake is longer and in the bottom left corner, which might be risky for future moves.\n\nIn the second choice (move left on turn 24), I can eat (5,1) on turn 25 and then (6,1) on turn 26, also score +2, but with a shorter snake for one turn.\n\nBut in both cases, I get both foods, so score is the same.\n\nBut in the first case, I ate them earlier, but the snake is longer sooner, which might be a problem for maneuvering.\n\nBut let's think about the board and obstacles.\n\nThere is an internal obstacle at (5,6), which is top row, y=6.\n\nThe snake body is around (3,5) to (6,3), etc.\n\nAfter eating both foods, the snake is long, and the space is limited.\n\nFor example, in the first scenario, after eating both, head at (5,1) on turn 26, then I need to move, say, left to (4,1) or up to (5,2), but (5,2) might be occupied or not.\n\nIn turn 26 after first choice: after eating both, on turn 26 from (5,1), I can move up to (5,2) or left to (4,1).\n\nIf I move up to (5,2), no food, positions change, tail moves, etc.\n\nBut the area below is tight.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid eating both immediately to have more space.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (5,1) will disappear after turn 25, so if I don't eat it by turn 25, I lose it.\n\nIn the second choice, by moving left on turn 24, I can eat it on turn 25.\n\nIf on turn 24 I move down to (6,1), I eat it on turn 24, and then (5,1) on turn 25.\n\nSo in both cases, I can eat both, no loss.\n\nBut let's see if there is a reason not to eat one.\n\nFor example, if I eat (6,1) on turn 24, then I am forced to eat (5,1) on turn 25, because no other move.\n\nWhereas if I move left on turn 24 to (5,2), then on turn 25 I can choose to eat (5,1) or not; I can move left to (4,2) instead, but then I lose the food at (5,1) since it disappears after turn 25.\n\nOn turn 25, if I don't eat it, it's gone, and I miss the score.\n\nSo it's better to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, (6,1) has long life, so I can eat it later.\n\nBut by eating both, I get the points.\n\nNow, after eating both, the snake is long, and the tail is at (3,5) or (2,5), which is top-left, while head is bottom.\n\nI need to think about survival.\n\nPerhaps I can plan a path to loop around.\n\nLet's look at the grid.\n\nGrid: 6x6 playable area, but with obstacle at (5,6).\n\nCells: y from 1 to 6, x from 1 to 6.\n\nObstacle at (5,6), so (5,6) blocked.\n\nAvailable cells: total 36 cells minus 1 obstacle, 35 cells, but snake occupies 10, so 25 free, but with food.\n\nSnake length 10, grid 6x6=36, minus obstacle (5,6), so 35 cells, snake occupies 10, so 25 free, including two food cells.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows, so less space.\n\nBut let's not worry about that.\n\nAnother important point: the tail is at (2,5), and if I can move the tail away, I can access more areas.\n\nBut with the long snake, it might be hard to turn.\n\nLet's consider the second option where I move left on turn 24.\n\nTurn 24: move left to (5,2), no eat, positions: [ (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) ] tail at (3,5).\n\nDirection left.\n\nTurn 25: move down to (5,1), eat food at (5,1), score +1, length 11.\n\nNew positions: head (5,1), then (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) tail, since ate, tail stays.\n\nDirection down.\n\nNow turn 26: from (5,1), direction down, cannot move up (reverse), down invalid wall, so must move left or right.\n\nLeft to (4,1): (4,1) free, no food.\n\nRight to (6,1): (6,1) has food, eat it, score +1, length 12.\n\nIf I move right to (6,1), eat, new positions: head (6,1), then (5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) — 12 segments, tail (3,5).\n\nDirection right.\n\nFrom here, I can move up to (6,2), but (6,2) is body (fourth segment), collision.\n\nLeft to (5,1), but (5,1) is body (second segment), collision.\n\nDown invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is up, but up to (6,2) is body, death.\n\nProblem!\n\nAfter eating at (6,1) on turn 26, head at (6,1), positions include (6,2), which is directly above, so moving up to (6,2) hits body.\n\nNo other moves, so stuck, death.\n\nTherefore, in this path, if I eat (6,1) on turn 26, I die immediately on the next turn because no valid moves.\n\nFrom (5,1) on turn 26, I could move left to (4,1) instead of right.\n\nThen no eat, positions: move head to (4,1), no food, so new positions: head (4,1), then (5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), and (3,5) removed? Before move, positions: [ (5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) ] 11 segments.\n\nAfter move to (4,1) no eat: new head (4,1), then old head (5,1) new body1, (5,2) new body2, (6,2) new body3, (6,3) new body4, (5,3) new body5, (4,3) new body6, (4,4) new body7, (5,4) new body8, (5,5) new body9, (4,5) new body10, and old tail (3,5) removed. New positions: [ (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5) ] 11 segments, tail at (4,5).\n\nDirection left.\n\nThen head at (4,1), direction left.\n\nFrom here, I can move up, down, left, but not right (opposite).\n\nDown invalid, wall.\n\nUp to (4,2): (4,2) free, no food.\n\nLeft to (3,1): (3,1) free, no food.\n\nThen I can go to (6,1) later, but (6,1) has food, I can eat it.\n\nFor example, turn 27: from (4,1), move up to (4,2), no eat.\n\nThen positions, etc.\n\nBut I still have the food at (6,1) to eat, and it has life span 8, so many turns.\n\nBut the snake is shorter now, 11 segments instead of 12 in the other path.\n\nIn the first path where I moved down on turn 24, I had to eat (5,1) on turn 25, then on turn 26 from (5,1), I can move left to (4,1) or up to (5,2).\n\nIf I move left to (4,1), similar to above.\n\nOr move up to (5,2).\n\nLet's go back to first choice.\n\nTurn 24: move down to (6,1), eat, positions: [ (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) ] 11 segments.\n\nTurn 25: move left to (5,1), eat, positions: [ (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5) ] 12 segments.\n\nTurn 26: from (5,1), direction left, cannot move right (opposite), down invalid, so move up to (5,2) or left to (4,1).\n\nIf move up to (5,2): (5,2) free, no food, so move without eat.\n\nNew positions: head (5,2), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), and (2,5) removed? Before move, 12 segments.\n\nAfter move to (5,2) no eat: new head (5,2), then old head (5,1) new body1, (6,1) new body2, (6,2) new body3, (6,3) new body4, (5,3) new body5, (4,3) new body6, (4,4) new body7, (5,4) new body8, (5,5) new body9, (4,5) new body10, (3,5) new body11, and old tail (2,5) removed. New positions: [ (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) ] 12 segments, tail at (3,5).\n\nDirection up.\n\nNow head at (5,2), direction up.\n\nPossible moves: up to (5,3), but (5,3) is body (sixth segment), collision.\n\nDown to (5,1), but (5,1) is body (second segment), collision.\n\nLeft to (4,2): (4,2) free, no food.\n\nRight to (6,2): (6,2) is body (fourth segment), collision.\n\nSo only possible move is left to (4,2).\n\nMove to (4,2), no food, new positions, etc.\n\nThen similar situation.\n\nBut in this case, I can survive.\n\nIf on turn 26 from (5,1) I move left to (4,1) instead.\n\nThen no eat, positions: new head (4,1), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), and (2,5) removed. New positions: [ (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5) ] 11 segments, tail at (4,5).\n\nDirection left.\n\nThen from (4,1), I can move up to (4,2) or left to (3,1), etc.\n\nAnd (6,1) is still there with food, I can go back to eat it later.\n\nFor example, move up to (4,2), then right to (5,2), etc., to reach (6,1).\n\nBut (6,1) has life span 8, so I have time.\n\nIn the second initial choice, when I moved left on turn 24, and on turn 25 I ate (5,1), then on turn 26 I can move left to (4,1) instead of right to avoid death.\n\nThen I have the same situation as above.\n\nBut in that case, I didn't eat (6,1) yet.\n\nSo to maximize score, I should eat both, but in a way that I don't trap myself.\n\nSince (6,1) has long life, I can delay eating it and first eat the one with short life.\n\n(5,1) has short life, must eat by turn 25.\n\n(6,1) can be eaten later.\n\nSo on turn 24, I should not eat (6,1) immediately, but move to a position to eat (5,1) on turn 25.\n\nSo moving left to (5,2) on turn 24 is better, because then on turn 25 I can eat (5,1).\n\nIf I move down to (6,1) on turn 24, I eat it, but then I am forced to eat (5,1) on turn 25, and then I am in a tight spot.\n\nWhereas if I move left to (5,2) on turn 24, I can eat (5,1) on turn 25, and then on turn 26 I can move left to (4,1) to avoid the trap, and then later go for (6,1).\n\nAlso, by not eating (6,1) early, the snake is shorter for now, easier to maneuver.\n\nMoreover, after moving to (4,1), I can explore the left side or go up.\n\nLet's plan the moves.\n\nTurn 24: move left to (5,2)\n\nNew positions: [ (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) ] tail (3,5)\n\nDirection left.\n\nTurn 25: move down to (5,1), eat food at (5,1), score +1, length 11.\n\nNew positions: [ (5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) ] tail (3,5)\n\nDirection down.\n\nTurn 26: from (5,1), direction down, cannot move up, down invalid, so move left to (4,1) or right to (6,1).\n\nIf move right to (6,1), as before, I die because no move next turn.\n\nSo must move left to (4,1) to survive.\n\nMove left to (4,1), no food, so snake moves, tail moves.\n\nNew positions: head to (4,1), then old head (5,1) new body1, (5,2) new body2, (6,2) new body3, (6,3) new body4, (5,3) new body5, (4,3) new body6, (4,4) new body7, (5,4) new body8, (5,5) new body9, (4,5) new body10, and old tail (3,5) removed. New positions: [ (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5) ] 11 segments, tail at (4,5).\n\nDirection left.\n\nNow head at (4,1), direction left.\n\nTurn 27: possible moves: up to (4,2), down invalid, left to (3,1), right to (5,1) but (5,1) is body, collision, and direction left, right opposite invalid.\n\nSo move up or left.\n\nSuppose I move up to (4,2), no food.\n\nNew positions: head to (4,2), then (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), and (4,5) removed? Before 11 segments.\n\nAfter move no eat: new head (4,2), then old head (4,1) new body1, (5,1) new body2, (5,2) new body3, (6,2) new body4, (6,3) new body5, (5,3) new body6, (4,3) new body7, (4,4) new body8, (5,4) new body9, (5,5) new body10, and old tail (4,5) removed. New positions: [ (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5) ] 11 segments, tail at (5,5).\n\nDirection up.\n\nNow head at (4,2), direction up.\n\nI can go to (4,3), but (4,3) is body (eighth segment), collision.\n\nDown to (4,1), body, collision.\n\nLeft to (3,2), free.\n\nRight to (5,2), which is body (fourth segment), collision.\n\nSo only move left to (3,2).\n\nTurn 28: move left to (3,2), no food, etc.\n\nBut I need to eat the food at (6,1).\n\nIt's at (6,1), and I am at (4,2), I can go right and down.\n\nFor example, from (4,2), after moving to (3,2), then to (3,3), etc., but it might take time.\n\nSince (6,1) has life span 8, on turn 24, life span 8, so it lasts until turn 31, so I have until turn 31 to eat it.\n\nCurrent turn 24, after moves, on turn 27 I am at (4,2), I can plan to go to (6,1).\n\nFor example, from (4,2), if I move right to (5,2), but (5,2) is occupied in current positions.\n\nIn turn 27 positions: [ (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5) ]\n\n(5,2) is occupied, so I cannot move right.\n\nOnly left to (3,2).\n\nThen from (3,2), I can move up, down, left, right.\n\nDown to (3,1), left to (2,2), up to (3,3), right to (4,2) but body.\n\nThen I can go to (3,3), (4,3), but (4,3) is body, etc.\n\nThe body is blocking the way to (6,1).\n\nLet's list free cells.\n\nAfter turn 27, positions as above, so occupied: (4,2), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)\n\nFree cells: for example, (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,5) is tail? Tail is (5,5), but (4,5) not occupied? In positions: (5,5) is there, but (4,5) is not in list, so free.\n\nList: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6.\n\nOccupied: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,2), (6,3)\n\n(5,5) and (6,3), etc.\n\nFree: (1,1) to (6,6) minus occupied and walls and obstacle.\n\nWalls at borders, obstacle (5,6).\n\nSo free cells: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,5) not occupied, (4,6) but (5,6) obstacle, (4,6) is free? (4,6) no wall, not obstacle, not in occupied, so free.\n\n(5,6) obstacle, (6,6) wall? y=7 wall, y=6 is playable, x=7 wall.\n\ny from 1 to 6, y=6 is top row.\n\n(4,6) is x=4,y=6, should be free.\n\n(6,1) has food, free.\n\n(6,4), (6,5), (6,6) free.\n\n etc.\n\nSo from head at (4,2), I moved to (3,2) on turn 28.\n\nThen from (3,2), direction left (since moved left from (4,2)? From (4,2) to (3,2), moved left, so direction left.\n\nThen turn 28: move, say, down to (3,1) or up to (3,3) or left to (2,2) or right to (4,2) body.\n\nSay move down to (3,1), no food.\n\nThen positions change.\n\nBut to reach (6,1), I can go to (3,1), then to (2,1), then to (2,2), etc., but it might take many turns, and I might hit the body or something.\n\nSince the tail is at (5,5), as I move, the tail moves, opening up space.\n\nFor example, after some moves, the body at (6,3) might move, so (6,1) can be accessed.\n\nBut it's complicated to simulate many turns.\n\nTo avoid risk, on turn 24, I should move down to (6,1) to eat it, then on turn 25 eat (5,1), then on turn 26 move left to (4,1) to survive, and then I have the food at (6,1) eaten, so no need to go back, but in this case, I ate both, so score is achieved.\n\nIn the first choice, I ate both by turn 25, and on turn 26 I can move to (4,1) or (5,2) to continue.\n\nAnd (6,1) is already eaten, so I don't have to worry about it.\n\nIn the second choice, if I don't eat (6,1) early, I have to go back for it, which might be risky with the long snake.\n\nBut in the second choice, after turn 26, I have not eaten (6,1), so I need to eat it later.\n\nBut since I have time, I can do it.\n\nBut to maximize survival, eating both early might be better, as long as I don't die immediately.\n\nIn the first choice, after eating both, on turn 26 from (5,1), if I move left to (4,1), I am at (4,1) with a long snake, but I can move up to (4,2), etc.\n\nAnd the tail is moving, so space opens up.\n\nSimilarly, in both cases, I can survive for a while.\n\nBut let's see the initial decision.\n\nAnother thing: the Tail Reward Danger. But in this case, the tail is not adjacent when eating, so no issue.\n\nSo for turn 24, both moves seem possible, but moving down allows me to eat (6,1) immediately and then (5,1), getting both points quickly.\n\nMoving left lets me eat (5,1) on turn 25 and then I can choose to eat (6,1) or not, but if I eat it on turn 26, I die, so I must not eat it immediately, and eat it later with a path.\n\nBut eating later might be safer or riskier.\n\nSince the grid is small, and snake is long, it might be better to eat available food when possible.\n\nAlso, the food at (6,1) is at the corner, so if I don't eat it now, I might not get a chance later if the snake blocks the way.\n\nFor example, in the second choice, after moving to (4,1) on turn 26, the body is at (5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), so (6,1) is adjacent, but I can move to it only if I am at (6,2) or (5,1), but (5,1) is body, (6,2) is body, so from (4,1), I can move to (5,1) but body, or to (4,2), etc., I cannot directly go to (6,1).\n\nTo reach (6,1), I need to go to (5,1) or (6,2), but they are occupied, so I have to wait for the snake to move so that those cells are free.\n\nFor example, if I move the snake, eventually (6,2) might be free when the tail moves.\n\nBut it could take several turns.\n\nSince (6,1) has long life, it's possible.\n\nBut to be safe, perhaps eating it early is better.\n\nMoreover, in the first choice, by eating both early, I have the points, and I can focus on survival.\n\nSo for turn 24, I think moving down to (6,1) is better to secure the food.\n\nThen on turn 25, move left to (5,1) to eat the other food.\n\nThen on turn 26, move left to (4,1) to avoid being trapped.\n\nThen continue from there.\n\nAnd for the answer, I need to provide actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe output should be like:\n\nTurn 24: action\n\nTurn 25: action\n\n...\n\nAt least 5 turns ahead, but not necessarily fixed, as long as I plan.\n\nSince the state changes, I need to specify based on current state.\n\nBut for the answer, I can provide a sequence.\n\nLet's decide.\n\nTurn 24: move down to (6,1) - D\n\nTurn 25: move left to (5,1) - L\n\nTurn 26: move left to (4,1) - L\n\nThen turn 27: from (4,1), direction left, move up to (4,2) - U\n\nTurn 28: from (4,2), direction up, can move left to (3,2) - L\n\n Etc.\n\nBut I don't need to specify all, but for the box, I think a few turns.\n\nThe format says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but the answer format is to list actions for turns starting from t1.\n\n\"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action ... }\"\n\nAnd \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" means to consider future turns in decision, not necessarily list 5 moves.\n\nBut in this case, for the immediate action, I need to choose.\n\nPerhaps for turn 24, move down.\n\nTo confirm, let's see if there is any risk.\n\nAnother point: food can spawn under body, but here no, both foods are free.\n\nAlso, Tail Reward Danger not applicable.\n\nSo I think moving down is fine.\n\nPerhaps I can move left on turn 24, then on turn 25 eat (5,1), then on turn 26 move left to (4,1), and then later eat (6,1), but it might be less direct.\n\nBut both are viable, but moving down gets the food earlier.\n\nSince (6,1) is directly below, and I can eat it now.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, the AI must prioritize eating the positive food at (6,1) and (5,1) without risking immediate death. The food at (5,1) has a short life span (disappears after turn 25), so it must be eaten by turn 25. The food at (6,1) has a longer life span (disappears after turn 31), allowing flexibility. However, the snake is currently in a position where moving down to (6,1) on turn 24 secures one food immediately and sets up for eating (5,1) on turn 25. After eating both, moving left to (4,1) on turn 26 avoids a potential trap in the bottom-left corner.\n\n### Analysis of Moves (5+ Turns Ahead):\n- **Turn 24 (Current State)**:\n  - Head at (6,2), direction down.\n  - Possible moves: Down (to (6,1)) or Left (to (5,2)). Moving down eats the positive food at (6,1), gaining +1 score and increasing length to 11. Moving left avoids immediate eating but risks missing (5,1) if not timed right.\n  - **Decision: Move Down** to (6,1) to eat the food and secure points. This also positions the head to access (5,1) next turn.\n\n- **Turn 25**:\n  - Head at (6,1), direction down.\n  - Only valid move is Left to (5,1) (down and right are walls; up is body collision and reverse move invalid). This eats the positive food at (5,1), gaining another +1 score (total +2) and increasing length to 12.\n  - **Decision: Move Left** to (5,1).\n\n- **Turn 26**:\n  - Head at (5,1), direction left.\n  - Possible moves: Left to (4,1) or Up to (5,2). Moving up to (5,2) is safe but leaves the snake vulnerable in the corner; moving left to (4,1) opens space for future movement and avoids body collisions.\n  - **Decision: Move Left** to (4,1) to escape the corner and improve maneuverability.\n\n- **Turn 27**:\n  - Head at (4,1), direction left.\n  - Possible moves: Up to (4,2) or Left to (3,1) (down is wall; right is body collision and reverse move invalid). Moving up starts navigating toward the center of the grid, where more space is available for future turns.\n  - **Decision: Move Up** to (4,2) to begin moving away from walls.\n\n- **Turn 28**:\n  - Head at (4,2), direction up.\n  - Possible moves: Left to (3,2) or Up to (4,3) (down is body collision; right is body collision). (4,3) is currently occupied by body, so moving left is safer and continues opening space.\n  - **Decision: Move Left** to (3,2) to avoid body risks and head toward less congested areas.\n\nThis sequence ensures both foods are eaten by turn 25, maximizing the score (+2) while avoiding deadly positions. After turn 28, the snake can continue exploring the grid, leveraging the tail movement to open space. The food at (6,1) is already consumed, so no need to revisit it. Future moves can focus on survival and potential new food spawns.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 24: D (down) \\\\\nTurn 25: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 26: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 27: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 28: L (left)\n}",

        "score": 11,
        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 25, and I'm playing Snake on a grid. The walls are at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), so it's an 8x8 grid since x and y go from 0 to 7 inclusive. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (6,1), then body segments at (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), and tail at (2,5). The head direction is down, which is D. Since it's moving down, that means from (6,1) to (6,2) and so on.\n\nFood: there are two food items. One at (5,1) with value 1 and life span 1. Another at (2,5) with value 1 and life span 10. Both have value 1, so positive food.\n\nLife span: for (5,1), life span is 1, meaning it disappears after this turn if not eaten. Since it's turn 25, and life span decreases every turn including current, after turn 25, if not eaten, it will be gone. Similarly, (2,5) has life span 10, so it will last until turn 25 + 10 = 35, but since it decreases each turn, after 10 more turns it disappears.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current, so for food at (5,1), life span 1 at turn 25 means it will disappear after turn 25, so it must be eaten on this turn to get it. Similarly, for (2,5), life span 10, it will be there for 10 turns starting from now, so until after turn 34, I think. Let's clarify: at turn t, life span N means it will disappear after N turns, so if not eaten by turn t+N-1, it's gone. Since it decreases each turn including current, at turn t, life span is N, after turn t, it becomes N-1, and so on, until it reaches 0 and disappears.\n\nSo for (5,1): at turn 25, life span 1, so after turn 25, it disappears. To eat it, I need to move to (5,1) on turn 25.\n\nFor (2,5): life span 10, so it will be there until after turn 34, meaning it can be eaten from turn 25 to turn 34 inclusive, I think. After turn 34, life span becomes 0, and it disappears.\n\nNow, the snake head is at (6,1), direction down. Since it's moving down, from (6,1) to (6,2), but (6,2) is the next segment, so the head is at (6,1), and it was moving down to (6,2), but since it's a list of positions, head is first, so at turn 25, head is at (6,1), and it just arrived there, I assume.\n\nThe snake positions are given for the current state, so at the start of turn 25, snake is at those positions, and I need to decide the move for turn 25.\n\nHead direction is D, meaning the last move was down, so from (6,0) or something to (6,1)? Let's see the positions: snake positions: [(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), ...] so head at (6,1), next segment at (6,2), so it must have come from above, so previous position was (6,0), but y=0 is a wall, so that can't be. y=0 is the bottom wall? Let's define coordinates.\n\nThe grid: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. I assume (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? Usually in such games, (0,0) might be top-left or bottom-left. But in the positions, snake has (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), and y increases, so if y=0 is bottom, then y=1 is above it, so moving up would increase y, but head direction is D, down.\n\nDirection D: (x,y-1) as per the movement constraints. U is (x,y+1), D is (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y).\n\nSo D is down, decreasing y.\n\nBut in positions, head at (6,1), then (6,2), (6,3), so (6,2) has higher y than (6,1), so if y increases up, then (6,1) to (6,2) is moving up, not down. Contradiction.\n\nPerhaps the coordinate system has y increasing downwards. Let's check the walls: y=0 and y=7, with y=0 being top or bottom?\n\nTypically in programming, y=0 is top, y increases down. But let's see from the positions.\n\nSnake positions: head (6,1), then (6,2), (6,3). If head direction is D, down, that would mean from a higher y to lower y, but (6,1) to (6,2) is from lower y to higher y if y=0 is top.\n\nI think I need to assume the coordinate system. From the food and positions, let's list all points.\n\nPerhaps y=0 is the bottom. Let's see the walls: \"Border Cells: x=0/x=7 or y=0/y=7\" so x=0 left, x=7 right, y=0 bottom, y=7 top? Or vice versa.\n\nIn the movement constraints, U is (x,y+1), which is up if y=0 bottom, or down if y=0 top. Standard is often y=0 top, U (y-1) but here it's defined as U (x,y+1), so let's see.\n\nU: (x,y+1) — if y+1, that could be moving up or down depending on orientation.\n\nBut in the position list, snake has (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), so y-coordinates increasing: 1,2,3.\n\nHead direction is D, which is down, (x,y-1). So from (6,1) moving down would go to (6,0), but (6,0) is a wall, since y=0 is border. But the snake is at (6,1), so it must have come from above or below.\n\nPrevious position: the positions are listed with head first, so at turn 25, head at (6,1), then body at (6,2), so the head moved to (6,1) from the previous position, and the body follows.\n\nSince head direction is D, down, that means the move that brought it to (6,1) was down, so from (6,2) to (6,1)? But (6,2) is the first body segment, so that can't be, because the body is behind the head.\n\nLet's think: at turn 24, head was at some position, say P, and it moved down to (6,1) at turn 25. Then the body segments follow. So the first body segment at (6,2) was the head at turn 24, I think.\n\nPositions at turn 25: head (6,1), then (6,2) which was head at turn 24, then (6,3) head at turn 23, and so on.\n\nSo at turn 24, head was at (6,2), and it moved down to (6,1) at turn 25. So from (6,2) to (6,1), which is decreasing y, so down direction. That makes sense if y=0 is the bottom, so y decreases as we go down? Let's clarify.\n\nIf y=0 is bottom, then moving down decreases y, so from (6,2) to (6,1) is down, y from 2 to 1, decreasing.\n\nThen U (x,y+1) would be up, increasing y.\n\nD (x,y-1) down, decreasing y.\n\nL (x-1,y) left, decreasing x.\n\nR (x+1,y) right, increasing x.\n\nWalls at x=0 (left), x=7 (right), y=0 (bottom), y=7 (top), so y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top.\n\nIn positions, (6,1) is at x=6, y=1, which is near the bottom since y=0 is bottom.\n\nSimilarly, (6,2) is above (6,1), etc.\n\nFood at (5,1) and (2,5).\n\n(5,1) is left of head, same y.\n\nHead at (6,1), food at (5,1), so adjacent left.\n\nAlso, internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nNow, for turn 25, I need to choose a move: U, D, L, R.\n\nBut no instant reverse, so since last move was D (down), I cannot move U (up) next, because that would be reverse.\n\nLast move was down to (6,1), so from down, I cannot move up immediately.\n\nSo possible moves from (6,1): L (left to (5,1)), R (right to (7,1)? But x=7 is wall, so not possible), U (up to (6,2)? But (6,2) is occupied by body, but let's see collision rules.\n\nMovement constraints: I can move to a cell if it's not wall and not body, except for the tail, because tail will move.\n\nCollision rules: body collision if head touches any body segment, but it says \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, from (6,1), possible moves:\n\n- L to (5,1): is this free? (5,1) has food with value 1, but let's see if it's safe.\n\n- R to (7,1): but x=7 is wall, so invalid, collision.\n\n- U to (6,2): (6,2) is occupied by the second segment of the body. Is it the tail? Tail is at (2,5), so (6,2) is not tail, it's a body segment, so moving there would cause collision, death.\n\n- D to (6,0): but y=0 is wall, bottom, so invalid.\n\nSo only possible move is L to (5,1).\n\nIs that right?\n\nLet's list:\n\nFrom (6,1):\n\n- Left: (5,1)\n\n- Right: (7,1) - wall\n\n- Up: (6,2) - occupied by body at (6,2), which is not tail\n\n- Down: (6,0) - wall\n\nSo only L to (5,1) is possible.\n\nBut (5,1) has food with value 1 and life span 1, so if I move there, I eat it this turn.\n\nNow, what about the tail? The tail is at (2,5), far away, so no issue.\n\nBut there's a special case: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because head and newly grown tail collide.\n\nBut here, head is at (6,1), tail at (2,5), not adjacent, so no problem.\n\nAdjacent means sharing a cell or adjacent cells? \"adjacent to the tail\" – tail is a cell, so if head is next to tail cell, and tail cell has food, then if you eat it, since eating food grows the tail, but when you eat food, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nSo, if head is adjacent to tail, meaning |dx| + |dy| = 1, and the tail cell has positive food, then if you move to the tail cell to eat the food, after eating, the snake grows, so the tail stays in place, but since head moved to where tail was, and tail doesn't move, but now head is on the food cell which was tail, but after growth, there is a new segment added, so the cell that was tail now has the new segment or what?\n\nStandard snake: when you eat food, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one segment.\n\nSo if head moves to a food cell, it eats it, and the tail remains, so length increases.\n\nIn this case, if the food is under the tail, but the rule says: \"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\"\n\nFor tail specifically, if tail has food, and head moves to it, but head moving to tail cell: since tail will move if no food eaten, but if food eaten, tail doesn't move.\n\nThe danger is when head is adjacent to tail, and tail has food, so if head moves to tail cell to eat food, then after eating, head is on that cell, and since tail didn't move, but the segment that was tail is still there, but now it's not tail, it's the second last or something? Let's think positions.\n\nSuppose tail is at T, and head is adjacent, say at H, and T has food. If head moves to T, it eats the food, so the snake grows. The new head position is T, and the tail does not move, so the segment that was tail remains, but now it's part of the body, and the new tail is the segment that was before tail? Let's index.\n\nPositions: before move, head at H, body segments, tail at T.\n\nAfter moving head to T (which has food), new head at T, the body segments move, but since food eaten, the tail doesn't move, so the last segment (tail) stays, and a new segment is added at head? No.\n\nStandard snake mechanics: when you move, the head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the next position, and if no food eaten, tail moves away from its position. If food eaten, tail doesn't move, so a new segment is effectively added at the tail position? I think I have confusion.\n\nTypically: the snake moves one step: head to new cell, each body segment to the previous position of the segment in front. So the tail segment leaves its cell.\n\nIf food is eaten at the new head position, then the tail does not move, so the snake grows: the tail stays, and a new segment is added where the tail was, but since tail didn't move, it means the last position is duplicated or something? Better to think in terms of positions.\n\nLet S be the list of positions: [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nAfter moving to a new cell without food: new positions [H_new, H, B1, B2, ..., B_{n-1}] so tail was B_{n-1} or T, and it moves to the previous position of the second last, but essentially, the tail cell is vacated.\n\nIf moving to a cell with food: new positions [H_new, H, B1, B2, ..., T] so the tail T stays, and H_new is added, so length increases by one.\n\nIn this case, when head moves to a cell with food, the tail position remains occupied.\n\nNow, for Tail Reward Danger: if head is adjacent to tail, and tail has food, so if head moves to tail cell to eat food, then after move, head is at the tail cell, and tail is still at the same cell? No.\n\nBefore move: head at H, tail at T, with |H-T|=1 adjacent.\n\nHead moves to T, which has food. After move, new head is at T, the body segments: B1 moves to H, B2 to previous B1, ..., up to the tail: since food eaten, tail does not move, so it stays at T. But new head is also at T? That can't be, same cell.\n\nConflict.\n\nPerhaps: when head moves to T, since T has food, after moving, the new positions are: head at T, then the first body segment moves to the previous head position H, and so on, but the tail, since food eaten, it doesn't move, so the tail segment remains at T, but head is also at T? Impossible.\n\nI think I have a mistake.\n\nStandard implementation: when the snake eats food, after moving to the food cell, the tail does not advance, so the segment that was tail remains tail, and the new head position is added, so the cell that was tail is still occupied by the tail, and head is at a new position.\n\nBut if head moves to the tail position, it's the same cell.\n\nIn this case, when head is adjacent to tail, and tail has food, if head moves to tail cell, it would be moving to a cell occupied by tail, but according to collision, you can move to tail cell only if tail moves away, but here if food is eaten, tail doesn't move.\n\nThe rule says: \"you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\" But that is when no food is eaten; if food is eaten, tail doesn't move.\n\nSo for Tail Reward Danger: if head moves to a cell that is the tail position and has food, then after eating, the tail stays, so head and tail are on the same cell, causing collision.\n\nSimilarly, if the cell is occupied by a body segment, collision.\n\nBut for tail, only if tail doesn't move, which happens when food is eaten.\n\nSo in this case, for Tail Reward Danger, it's specifically when moving to the tail cell to eat food, it causes immediate collision because after growth, head and tail are on same cell or adjacent? The rule says \"head and newly grown tail will collide\" but I think it's on the same cell.\n\nThe rule: \"because the head and newly grown tail will collide\" – after eating, head is at the food cell, which was tail, and tail is still there, so they occupy the same cell, collision.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in this situation, head is adjacent to tail, so moving to tail cell means |dx| + |dy| =1, so it's possible.\n\nIn our case, head at (6,1), tail at (2,5), distance |6-2| + |1-5| = 4 + 4 = 8, not adjacent, so no issue.\n\nBack to turn 25.\n\nAt (6,1), only possible move is L to (5,1), which has food.\n\nSo I must move to (5,1) to eat the food, since it's the only move, and it has positive food with value 1.\n\nLife span 1, so if I don't eat it now, it disappears, but since I have to move there anyway, I might as well eat it.\n\nBut is (5,1) safe? After moving, what happens.\n\nAfter moving to (5,1), I eat the food, so snake grows. New positions: head now at (5,1), then the previous head (6,1) becomes body, so new positions: head (5,1), then (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), and tail (2,5). But since I ate food, tail doesn't move, so the tail is still at (2,5), and length increases.\n\nBefore: 11 segments? Positions: 11 positions, so length 11.\n\nAfter eating: head at (5,1), body: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), ..., up to (2,5), and since food eaten, tail remains, so 12 segments.\n\nThe food at (5,1) is eaten, so it's gone.\n\nNow, for the next turns, I need to think ahead.\n\nThe other food is at (2,5) with value 1, life span 10, so I can eat it later.\n\nBut now head is at (5,1), direction: I moved left from (6,1) to (5,1), so last move was L (left).\n\nNow, possible moves from (5,1):\n\n- U: (5,2) - is it free? Let's see current positions after move.\n\nAfter turn 25 move, positions: head (5,1), body: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), tail (2,5).\n\nSo cells occupied: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nNow, from (5,1):\n\n- U to (5,2): is (5,2) occupied? In the list, (5,2) is not in positions, so free? But let's check if it's wall or something.\n\n(5,2) x=5,y=2, not wall, and not in body positions, so should be free.\n\n- D to (5,0): but y=0 is wall, invalid.\n\n- L to (4,1): (4,1) is not in positions, so free? (4,1) not listed, so yes.\n\n- R to (6,1): but (6,1) is occupied by the first body segment, which is not tail (tail is at (2,5)), so moving there would cause collision.\n\n(6,1) is the second position, body segment, not tail.\n\nSo from (5,1), possible moves: U to (5,2), L to (4,1), and R to (6,1) but occupied, invalid; D to (5,0) wall, invalid.\n\nSo U or L.\n\nNow, last move was L (left), so I cannot move R (right) next, but R is invalid anyway.\n\nNo instant reverse: cannot move opposite to current direction.\n\nCurrent head direction: after moving left, direction is L.\n\nSo cannot move R, but R is invalid, so no issue.\n\nNow, I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, the food at (2,5) is under the tail, since tail is at (2,5) and food is there.\n\nFood can be eaten only if the body moves away and head moves on.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (2,5) with food, so to eat it, the tail must move away first, then head can move to (2,5).\n\nBut since the food is under tail, and tail will move if no food eaten, so if I don't eat food for a while, tail moves, freeing (2,5), then I can go there.\n\nLife span 10, so plenty of time.\n\nNow, for turn 25, I must move to (5,1), as it's the only choice.\n\nSo for turn 25: L to (5,1)\n\nThen for turn 26, I need to choose between U or L from (5,1).\n\nNow, let's think about the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,6), so (5,6) is blocked.\n\nSnake positions: after turn 25, head at (5,1), body: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), tail (2,5)\n\nThe body forms a sort of path.\n\nI should consider the available space and paths to the other food.\n\nAlso, since I need to maximize score, and avoid risks, I should eat the positive food when possible.\n\nBut (2,5) is under tail, so I need to free it first.\n\nCurrently, the snake is long, 12 segments after eating at turn 25.\n\nTo free (2,5), I need the tail to move, which happens when I don't eat food, so the tail advances.\n\nEach time I don't eat food, the tail moves forward, vacating cells.\n\nIf I eat food, tail stays, so (2,5) remains occupied until I don't eat for a move.\n\nBut the food is at (2,5), so when tail moves, the food is still there, but only if life span allows.\n\nLife span 10, so it will be there for 10 turns.\n\nNow, from current position (5,1), after turn 25.\n\nFor turn 26, I can go U to (5,2) or L to (4,1).\n\nIf I go U to (5,2), then head to (5,2), no food there, so tail moves: the tail (2,5) moves to the next position, which is? The positions: before move, tail is at (2,5), the segment before tail is (3,5), so when tail moves, it goes to (3,5)? Let's trace.\n\nAfter turn 25 positions: let's list with indices for clarity.\n\nAssume positions: head: (5,1)\n\nThen body segments: seg1: (6,1), seg2: (6,2), seg3: (6,3), seg4: (5,3), seg5: (4,3), seg6: (4,4), seg7: (5,4), seg8: (5,5), seg9: (4,5), seg10: (3,5), tail: (2,5) — but tail is the last, so it's seg11? Let's count positions.\n\nPositions: 1. (5,1) head, 2. (6,1), 3. (6,2), 4. (6,3), 5. (5,3), 6. (4,3), 7. (4,4), 8. (5,4), 9. (5,5), 10. (4,5), 11. (3,5), 12. (2,5) tail. Since I ate food, there are 12 segments.\n\nWhen I move, if no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the next position, tail leaves.\n\nSo for turn 26, if I move to (5,2), no food there, so new head at (5,2), then seg1 moves to (5,1) (previous head), seg2 moves to (6,1) (previous seg1), seg3 to (6,2), seg4 to (6,3), seg5 to (5,3), seg6 to (4,3), seg7 to (4,4), seg8 to (5,4), seg9 to (5,5), seg10 to (4,5), seg11 to (3,5), and tail (seg12) moves to (2,5)? No.\n\nThe segments: after move, new positions: head at (5,2), then the previous head (5,1) becomes body, so position 2: (5,1), then the previous seg1 (6,1) becomes position 3, previous seg2 (6,2) position 4, ..., up to previous seg11 (3,5) position 12, and the tail was (2,5), but since no food eaten, tail moves away, so it is not included; instead, the new tail is the previous seg11 (3,5).\n\nLet's index:\n\nBefore move turn 26: positions: P0: head (5,1), P1: (6,1), P2: (6,2), P3: (6,3), P4: (5,3), P5: (4,3), P6: (4,4), P7: (5,4), P8: (5,5), P9: (4,5), P10: (3,5), P11: tail (2,5)\n\nAfter moving head to (5,2) with no food: new head at (5,2), then P0 moves to (5,1) as body, P1 moves to (6,1), P2 to (6,2), P3 to (6,3), P4 to (5,3), P5 to (4,3), P6 to (4,4), P7 to (5,4), P8 to (5,5), P9 to (4,5), P10 to (3,5), and since no food, P11 (tail) is not included, so the new tail is P10, which is (3,5).\n\nSo positions after turn 26: head (5,2), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) — 12 segments? P10 was (3,5), and it is included, but P11 is gone.\n\nBefore: 12 positions.\n\nAfter move no food: head to new position, and all body segments shift, so the tail position is vacated, and new length is 11? No.\n\nNumber of segments: when no food eaten, length same, head moves, tail moves, so one segment added at head, one removed at tail, so length same.\n\nPositions: new head, then the previous positions from head to one before tail.\n\nIn list: new positions: [new_head, old_head, old_P1, old_P2, ..., old_P10] since old_P11 is tail and not included.\n\nOld positions: P0 to P11, 12 points.\n\nAfter move no food: new head, then old_P0, old_P1, ..., old_P10, so 12 points? old_P0 to old_P10 is 11 points, plus new head, 12 points, but old_P11 is gone.\n\nold_P0 is head, old_P1 to old_P10 are body, old_P11 tail.\n\nAfter move: new head, then old_P0 (previous head), old_P1, old_P2, ..., old_P10. old_P10 is the second last, old_P11 tail not included.\n\nSo the new list has new head, and old_P0 to old_P10, which is 11 points, but old_P0 to old_P10 is 11 points, plus new head, 12 points? Indices: new head, then old positions from P0 to P10 inclusive.\n\nP0 to P10 is 11 positions (P0, P1, ..., P10), plus new head, so 12 positions, same length.\n\nFor example, before: P0, P1, P2, ..., P11\n\nAfter move to new cell no food: [new_head, P0, P1, P2, ..., P10]  so P11 is removed, but P10 is now the tail.\n\nIn this case, P10 was (3,5), so new tail at (3,5), and (2,5) is vacated.\n\nSimilarly, if I had moved to (4,1) instead.\n\nBut for now, back to turn 26 choices.\n\nFrom (5,1), I can go U to (5,2) or L to (4,1).\n\n(5,2) is free, (4,1) is free.\n\nIf I go U to (5,2), then as above, tail moves, so (2,5) is vacated, and food at (2,5) is now accessible, since body moved away.\n\nThen I can later go to (2,5) to eat it.\n\nIf I go L to (4,1), then head to (4,1), no food there, so tail moves similarly, (2,5) vacated.\n\nBut (4,1) is closer to bottom, might be limiting.\n\nAlso, there is the internal obstacle at (5,6), but that's up.\n\nNow, I need to think about survival and multiple turns.\n\nThe grid has walls, and the snake body, so I need to avoid trapping myself.\n\nCurrent position: after turn 25, head at (5,1), which is near bottom-left.\n\nThe body is mostly on the right and up.\n\n(5,1) to (6,1) to (6,2) to (6,3) to (5,3) to (4,3) to (4,4) to (5,4) to (5,5) to (4,5) to (3,5) to (2,5)\n\nSo the snake occupies a path from (5,1) to (2,5) via the body.\n\nThe free cells: let's list all grid cells.\n\nx from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so border cells are walls, so playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=0 and x=7 cannot be moved to.\n\nSimilarly y=0 and y=7 walls.\n\nAlso internal obstacle (5,6), so (5,6) blocked.\n\nSo playable cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except (5,6) is obstacle.\n\nx=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, that's 6x6=36 cells.\n\nBut snake occupies 12 cells, so 24 free cells.\n\nAfter turn 25, snake on: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\n(5,5) is occupied, and (4,5), etc.\n\nFree cells include (1,1) to (4,1) except occupied, (5,1) occ, (6,1) occ, so (1,1),(2,1),(3,1),(4,1) but (4,1) might be free? Positions have (4,3),(4,4) but not (4,1) or (4,2), etc.\n\nList all free cells.\n\nx=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except (5,6) obstacle.\n\nOccupied by snake: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (4,4), (5,4), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (5,1)\n\n(5,1) and (6,1) occupied.\n\nSo free cells:\n\nFor y=1: x=1,2,3,4 (since x=5,6 occ)\n\n(1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1)\n\ny=2: x=1,2,3,4,5,6 but (6,2) occ, so (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2)\n\ny=3: x=1,2,3,4,5,6 but (4,3),(5,3),(6,3) occ, so (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)\n\ny=4: x=1,2,3,4,5,6 but (4,4),(5,4) occ, so (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (6,4)\n\n(6,4) is free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\ny=5: x=1,2,3,4,5,6 but (2,5),(3,5),(4,5),(5,5) occ, so (1,5), (6,5)\n\ny=6: x=1,2,3,4,5,6 but (5,6) obstacle, and walls y=7 top, but y=6 is playable? y from 1 to 6, y=6 is not wall, except (5,6) obstacle.\n\nBut y=6, x=1,2,3,4,6 free? (6,6) is not wall, x=6,y=6.\n\ny=6 cells: (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6) obstacle, (6,6)\n\nAnd none occupied by snake, so all free except (5,6).\n\nSimilarly, y=4: (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (6,4) free.\n\nNow, for turn 26, from (5,1), if I go U to (5,2), which is free.\n\nThen as before, tail moves, so (2,5) vacated, and food at (2,5) is now free to eat.\n\nThen head at (5,2), I can go to (2,5) to eat, but it's not adjacent, need path.\n\nFrom (5,2), I can go L to (4,2), or U to (5,3), but (5,3) is occupied by body? After turn 26 move to (5,2), positions: head (5,2), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) — tail at (3,5)\n\n(2,5) is free now with food.\n\nFrom (5,2), possible moves: U to (5,3), but (5,3) is occupied by body (in positions, (5,3) is there), so collision.\n\nD to (5,1), but (5,1) is occupied by body, collision.\n\nL to (4,2), which is free.\n\nR to (6,2), but (6,2) occupied, collision.\n\nSo only possible move from (5,2) is L to (4,2).\n\nThen from there, etc.\n\nIf at turn 26 I go L to (4,1) from (5,1).\n\nThen head to (4,1), no food, tail moves, (2,5) vacated.\n\nNew positions: head (4,1), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) tail.\n\nFrom (4,1), possible moves: U to (4,2), free; D to (4,0) wall invalid; L to (3,1), free; R to (5,1), occupied, invalid.\n\nLast move was L (from (5,1) to (4,1)), so cannot move R.\n\nSo U or L.\n\nNow, comparing the two options for turn 26.\n\nFirst, if I go U to (5,2) at turn 26, then I must go L to (4,2) at turn 27.\n\nThen from (4,2), I can go U to (4,3), but (4,3) is occupied? After turn 27, positions depend.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nTurn 26: move U to (5,2)\n\nPositions after turn 26: head (5,2), body: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)  // tail at (3,5), (2,5) free with food.\n\nNow turn 27: from (5,2), only possible move L to (4,2) (since U,D,R all invalid as above).\n\nMove to (4,2), no food there.\n\nThen new positions: head (4,2), then (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)  // tail at (4,5)? After move: new head (4,2), then old head (5,2), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), and old tail (3,5) not included? Before turn 27: positions P0: (5,2), P1: (5,1), P2: (6,1), P3: (6,2), P4: (6,3), P5: (5,3), P6: (4,3), P7: (4,4), P8: (5,4), P9: (5,5), P10: (4,5), P11: (3,5)\n\nAfter move to (4,2) no food: new head (4,2), then P0: (5,2), P1: (5,1), P2: (6,1), P3: (6,2), P4: (6,3), P5: (5,3), P6: (4,3), P7: (4,4), P8: (5,4), P9: (5,5), P10: (4,5)  // P11 (3,5) gone, tail at P10 (4,5)\n\nNow (2,5) is free with food.\n\nHead at (4,2), possible moves: U to (4,3), but (4,3) is occupied by body (P6: (4,3)), collision.\n\nD to (4,1), but (4,1) not in positions, but is it free? (4,1) was not occupied before, and not in new positions, so free? Let's see.\n\nNew positions: (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)\n\nSo (4,1) not occupied, and not wall, so free.\n\nSimilarly, L to (3,2), free? (3,2) not occupied.\n\nR to (5,2), occupied, invalid.\n\nSo from (4,2), possible moves: D to (4,1) or L to (3,2).\n\nU to (4,3) occupied, collision.\n\nSo D or L.\n\nLast move was L (from (5,2) to (4,2)? At turn 27, I moved from (5,2) to (4,2), which is left, so direction L.\n\nCannot move R.\n\nBut R is invalid anyway.\n\nNow, if I go D to (4,1), or L to (3,2).\n\n(4,1) is bottom, might be dead end.\n\n(3,2) is better.\n\nBut I need to get to (2,5) to eat the food.\n\nFrom (4,2), I can go L to (3,2), then to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut (4,3) is occupied, so I have to go around.\n\nFree cells near: (4,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)? (3,3) free? Not occupied.\n\nIn positions above, (3,3) not listed, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3), etc.\n\nFrom (4,2), if I go L to (3,2), then from there U to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut let's see the path to (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is at top-left, head at (4,2) bottom-left.\n\nI can go to (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), then to (2,5), but (2,4) free? y=4, x=2, (2,4) not occupied, free.\n\nThen to (2,5).\n\n(2,5) has food, so I can eat it.\n\nBut I need to move step by step.\n\nFirst, for turn 27, from (4,2), if I go L to (3,2), then turn 28 from (3,2) to (3,3), turn 29 to (3,4), turn 30 to (2,4) or (3,5) but (3,5) is occupied? After turn 27, positions have (4,5) as tail, but (3,5) was vacated earlier.\n\nAfter turn 27 positions: head (4,2), then (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5) tail.\n\nSo (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (2,5) all free.\n\n(3,5) was tail at some point but now vacated.\n\n(3,5) not occupied.\n\nSo from (3,2) I can go U to (3,3), then U to (3,4), then L to (2,4) or U to (3,5) but (3,5) is free? (3,5) not in positions, so free.\n\nThen from (3,4) to (2,4), then to (2,5).\n\nOr directly to (2,5) from (2,4) or (3,5).\n\n(2,5) adjacent to (2,4) and (3,5).\n\nSo possible.\n\nBut let's count turns.\n\nTurn 25: move L to (5,1)\n\nTurn 26: move U to (5,2)\n\nTurn 27: move L to (4,2)\n\nThen turn 28: from (4,2) to (3,2) or (4,1)? I was at (4,2) after turn 27.\n\nAfter turn 27, head at (4,2), I can move to (3,2) or (4,1).\n\nIf I move to (3,2) at turn 28.\n\nThen positions: head (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5) // tail at (5,5)? Before move: P0 (4,2), P1 (5,2), P2 (5,1), P3 (6,1), P4 (6,2), P5 (6,3), P6 (5,3), P7 (4,3), P8 (4,4), P9 (5,4), P10 (5,5), P11 (4,5)\n\nAfter move to (3,2) no food: new head (3,2), then P0 (4,2), P1 (5,2), P2 (5,1), P3 (6,1), P4 (6,2), P5 (6,3), P6 (5,3), P7 (4,3), P8 (4,4), P9 (5,4), P10 (5,5)  // P11 (4,5) gone, tail at (5,5)\n\nThen turn 29: from (3,2) to (3,3) U, or (2,2) L, or (3,1) D, or (4,2) R but occupied.\n\nPossible: U to (3,3) free, L to (2,2) free, D to (3,1) free.\n\nR to (4,2) occupied.\n\nLast move L to (3,2), so cannot move R.\n\nSo U, L, or D.\n\nIf I go U to (3,3), then turn 30 to (3,4), turn 31 to (2,4) or (3,5), etc.\n\nFrom (2,4) to (2,5) at some turn.\n\nBut (2,5) has food, so when I move to it, I eat it.\n\nLife span 10 from turn 25, so at turn 25, life span 10, so it can be eaten until turn 34.\n\nTurn 31 is fine.\n\nBut let's see the other option for turn 26.\n\nAt turn 26, from (5,1), if I go L to (4,1) instead of U.\n\nThen turn 26: move L to (4,1)\n\nPositions after: head (4,1), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) tail at (3,5), (2,5) free.\n\nFrom (4,1), possible moves: U to (4,2) free, L to (3,1) free, D invalid, R to (5,1) occupied.\n\nLast move L, cannot move R.\n\nSo U or L.\n\nIf I go U to (4,2), then similar to before.\n\nOr L to (3,1).\n\nIf I go U to (4,2), then from (4,2), same as after turn 27 in previous path.\n\nThen I can go to (3,2), etc.\n\nSlightly different, but similar.\n\nBut if I go L to (3,1) at turn 26.\n\nThen positions: head (3,1), then (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5) tail.\n\n(2,5) free.\n\nFrom (3,1), possible moves: U to (3,2), R to (4,1) occupied, D to (3,0) wall, L to (2,1).\n\nLast move L to (3,1), cannot move R.\n\nSo U or L.\n\nIf U to (3,2), then to (3,3), etc.\n\nOr L to (2,1), then to (2,2), etc.\n\nTo reach (2,5), I can go through (2,1) to (2,2) to (2,3) to (2,4) to (2,5), or through (3,3) to (3,4) to (2,4) to (2,5), etc.\n\nBut (2,3), (2,4) are free.\n\nNow, back to the first path, at turn 27, from (4,2), I had to choose between D or L.\n\nIf I go L to (3,2), I can go up.\n\nIf I go D to (4,1), I might be trapped.\n\nFor example, from (4,2) go D to (4,1), then at (4,1), possible moves: U to (4,2) but just came from, or L to (3,1), or R to (5,1) occupied.\n\nBut U might be possible, but no reverse only for immediate opposite, but U and D are opposite, so if last move was D to (4,1), then cannot move U next.\n\nLast move D, so cannot move U.\n\nSo from (4,1), after moving D, direction D, cannot move U.\n\nPossible: L to (3,1), or R to (5,1) occupied, so only L to (3,1).\n\nThen from (3,1), etc.\n\nBut (4,1) is corner, might be risky, but I can still get out.\n\nBut to maximize survival, better to go towards the center or open area.\n\nNow, for the food at (2,5), I should eat it soon, but life span 10, so no rush.\n\nBut if I don't eat it, and go elsewhere, I might have opportunities.\n\nBut in this case, the grid has limited space, and snake is long, so I need to be careful not to trap myself.\n\nAlso, there is the internal obstacle at (5,6), which might block.\n\nBut currently, from the positions, the upper right is relatively free.\n\nFor example, (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6) obstacle, so (6,6) free, (1,6), etc.\n\nBut let's think about the answer format.\n\nI need to output actions for turn 25 and beyond, but the state is at turn 25, and I need to output for turn 25, then 26, etc., but how many turns? The instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output format shows \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" but it doesn't specify how many, but since it's a sequence, I should provide a few moves, but for the decision, I need to plan.\n\nBut in the output, I need to list the actions starting from turn 25.\n\nFor turn 25, I have only one choice: L to (5,1)\n\nThen for turn 26, I can choose U or L from (5,1).\n\nNow, to prioritize long-term survival, I should avoid going to dead ends.\n\nFrom (5,1), if I go L to (4,1), I am at bottom, and with body above, it might be tight.\n\nIf I go U to (5,2), I am at (5,2), then must go L to (4,2), then from there I can go to (3,2), (3,3), etc., which is better.\n\nAlso, from (5,2) to (4,2), I am moving away from the body.\n\nThe body is at (5,1), (6,1), etc., so (4,2) is free.\n\nThen I can go to (3,2), (3,3), and to (2,5) to eat the food.\n\nSince (2,5) is free after tail moved at turn 26.\n\nIn the first move sequence, at turn 26, when I move U to (5,2), tail moves, (2,5) vacated.\n\nThen at turn 27, I move to (4,2), then turn 28 to (3,2), turn 29 to (3,3), turn 30 to (3,4), turn 31 to (2,4), turn 32 to (2,5) to eat.\n\nAt (2,5), I eat the food, value +1.\n\nLife span 10, turn 32 is turn 25+7=32, life span at turn 25 is 10, so it can be eaten until turn 34, so turn 32 is fine.\n\nI could go faster, but need to avoid body.\n\nFor example, from (3,3) I can go to (2,3) if free, then to (2,4), etc.\n\nBut (2,3) free.\n\nBut similar.\n\nNow, for turn 26, if I go L to (4,1), then I might go to (3,1), then (3,2), etc., but it takes one more turn to reach the same point.\n\nFor example, turn 26: L to (4,1), then turn 27: U to (4,2) or L to (3,1).\n\nIf U to (4,2), then same as after turn 27 in first path.\n\nIf L to (3,1), then turn 28 to (3,2), etc., slower.\n\nSo better to go U at turn 26 from (5,1).\n\nMoreover, by going to (5,2), I avoid the bottom row, which might be safer.\n\nSo for turn 25: L\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nThen turn 27: from (5,2) to (4,2) L\n\nNow for turn 28, from (4,2) to (3,2) L or to (4,1) D, but D to (4,1) is down, which might lead to corner.\n\nBetter to go L to (3,2)\n\nThen turn 29: from (3,2) to (3,3) U\n\nTurn 30: from (3,3) to (3,4) U\n\nThen turn 31: from (3,4) to (2,4) L or to (3,5) U\n\n(3,5) might be free or not.\n\nAt turn 30, positions depend.\n\nBut let's not simulate too far.\n\nSince I need to eat the food at (2,5), from (3,4) I can go directly to (2,4) then to (2,5), or if (3,5) free, to (3,5) then to (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is adjacent to (2,4) and (3,5).\n\nIn the path, (2,4) and (3,5) should be free.\n\nBut to be safe, I can go to (2,4) first.\n\nTurn 31: move to (2,4)\n\nThen turn 32: move to (2,5) and eat.\n\nAt turn 32, move to (2,5), which has food, so eat it.\n\nBut need to make sure it's not Tail Reward Danger, but tail is far away.\n\nNow, for the output, I should provide the sequence for a few turns.\n\nBut the instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output format shows multiple turns, so I'll provide for turn 25 to, say, turn 28 or so.\n\nSince at turn 25 I must do L, then at 26 U, 27 L, etc.\n\nBut for turn 26, I have a choice, but I think U is better.\n\nSimilarly, later moves.\n\nBut to confirm, is there any risk?\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (5,6), but I'm not going there yet.\n\nAlso, after eating at (2,5), the snake will be longer, and I need to find more food, but no other food now, so I need to survive.\n\nBut for now, let's output the actions.\n\nSo for turn 25: L (to (5,1))\n\nThen turn 26: U (to (5,2))\n\nThen turn 27: L (to (4,2))\n\nNow for turn 28, from (4,2), I can go L to (3,2) or D to (4,1), but D to (4,1) is down to bottom, and last move was L, so D is not opposite, so possible, but better to go L to (3,2) to go towards the food.\n\nSimilarly, turn 29 to (3,3), etc.\n\nBut since I need to specify, I'll go with this.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 25: L\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: L\n\nTurn 28: L (to (3,2))\n\nTurn 29: U (to (3,3))\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut for the answer, I can list up to 5 turns or so.\n\nSince the food at (2,5) is to be eaten later, and I have a path.\n\nBut at turn 25, I must do L, no choice.\n\nIn the state, at turn 25, head at (6,1), only L possible, so no other option.\n\nThen at turn 26, from (5,1), U or L, I chose U.\n\nBut is L better? If I go L to (4,1), then I can go to (3,1), (2,1), etc., but (2,1) to (2,2), then to (2,3), etc., to (2,5), but (2,5) might be eaten earlier? No, similar.\n\nBut from (4,1) to (3,1) to (2,1) to (2,2) to (2,3) to (2,4) to (2,5), from turn 26 to turn 32, same as before.\n\nBut going U to (5,2) gets me away from the bottom faster.\n\nSo U is fine.\n\nTherefore, for the answer:\n\nTurn 25: L\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: L\n\nAnd I can add more if needed, but the format might expect just the current and immediate, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and output multiple, so I'll provide a sequence.\n\nBut let's see how many.\n\nSince the life span of the second food is long, and I have a plan, I can stop after a few moves.\n\nSo for now:\n</think>\nBased on the current state at turn \\( t_1 = 25 \\), the snake must maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks, with a focus on long-term survival over 5+ turns. The analysis considers all movement constraints, collision risks, and food mechanics.\n\n### Key Observations for Turn 25:\n- **Snake head position**: (6, 1), with direction down (D).\n- **Possible moves from (6, 1)**:\n  - U (up) to (6, 2): Occupied by body segment (not tail), so collision and death.\n  - D (down) to (6, 0): Wall (y=0), invalid.\n  - L (left) to (5, 1): Free cell with positive food (value +1, life span 1).\n  - R (right) to (7, 1): Wall (x=7), invalid.\n- **Only valid move**: L to (5, 1) to eat the positive food, avoiding starvation risk since the food disappears after this turn. Eating it increases snake length by 1.\n- **Risks**: No Tail Reward Danger (tail at (2, 5) is not adjacent), and no immediate collision.\n\n### Long-Term Planning (5+ Turns Ahead):\n- **Primary goal**: Survive and eat the remaining positive food at (2, 5) (value +1, life span 10, can be eaten until turn 34). To eat this, the tail must move away first, freeing the cell.\n- **Strategy after eating at (5, 1)**:\n  - Move upwards to open areas (e.g., (5, 2), (4, 2)) to avoid the bottom row, which has limited space and risks trapping.\n  - Navigate towards (2, 5) via a safe path: (5, 1) → (5, 2) → (4, 2) → (3, 2) → (3, 3) → (3, 4) → (2, 4) → (2, 5). This path is free of obstacles and body segments after the tail moves.\n  - **Why this path?** \n    - Avoids dead ends (e.g., bottom row) and body collisions.\n    - Eats (2, 5) around turn 32, within life span (turn 34).\n    - Prioritizes open space for future movement; after eating (2, 5), the snake can explore upper-left areas.\n- **Risks mitigated**:\n  - Internal obstacle at (5, 6) is avoided in the near term.\n  - Tail Reward Danger is irrelevant until head approaches tail; currently, tail is distant.\n  - No instant reverse issues are triggered in the planned moves.\n- **Contingency**: If blocked, adjust to alternative paths (e.g., via (3, 1) or (4, 1)), but the chosen path minimizes risks.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence for turns 25 to 29 ensures the snake eats the immediate food, frees the tail cell, and progresses safely toward the second food. Moves are chosen to avoid collisions and traps.\n\n- **Turn 25**: Move L (left) to (5, 1) – eats positive food, increases length to 12.\n- **Turn 26**: Move U (up) to (5, 2) – moves to open area; tail moves, freeing (2, 5) for future eating.\n- **Turn 27**: Move L (left) to (4, 2) – continues toward (2, 5) path.\n- **Turn 28**: Move L (left) to (3, 2) – avoids bottom row and stays on safe path.\n- **Turn 29**: Move U (up) to (3, 3) – progresses toward (3, 4) and (2, 5).\n\n### Next Steps (Beyond Turn 29):\n- Turn 30: Move U to (3, 4).\n- Turn 31: Move L to (2, 4).\n- Turn 32: Move U to (2, 5) to eat the second positive food.\n\nThis plan scores +2 (both foods eaten) with minimal risk, ensuring survival beyond turn 34.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 25: L (left)  \nTurn 26: U (up)  \nTurn 27: L (left)  \nTurn 28: L (left)  \nTurn 29: U (up)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid since the walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. That means the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7). There's also an internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nCurrent turn is 26.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (5,1), and the body segments follow: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5). So the tail is at (2,5).\n\nHead direction is L, which means left. So the snake is currently moving left.\n\nFood: There's one food item at (2,5) with value 1 and life span 9. But (2,5) is also the tail position of the snake. According to the rules, food can spawn under the snake's body, and it can only be eaten if the body moves away and the head moves onto it.\n\nIn this case, (2,5) is occupied by the tail. So to eat this food, the tail must move away, and then the head must move to (2,5). But there's a special case: Tail Reward Danger. If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake because after eating, the snake grows, so the new tail would be where the head was, but since the head moves to the tail position, and the tail moves away, it might cause a collision.\n\nLet me read that carefully: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nIn this state, the head is at (5,1) and tail at (2,5). Are they adjacent? Let's see the positions: (5,1) and (2,5). The difference in x is 3, y is 4, so not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so up, down, left, right, not diagonal.\n\nDistance: |5-2|=3, |1-5|=4, so not adjacent. So the Tail Reward Danger doesn't apply here because the head is not adjacent to the tail.\n\nBut the food is on the tail cell, (2,5). To eat it, we need the tail to move away first, then head to move there.\n\nSince the snake moves one step at a time, and the tail moves each turn, we need to plan a path to get to (2,5) after the tail has moved.\n\nFirst, let's list all the positions:\n\nHead: (5,1)\n\nBody: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)  // that's 12 segments? Let's count:\n\nPositions: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)] — that's 12 positions, so snake length is 12.\n\nFood at (2,5) with value 1 and life span 9. Since life span decreases every turn, including current, it will disappear after 9 turns, so by turn 26 + 9 - 1 = 34? Let's calculate: on turn 26, life span is 9, so it decreases to 8 on turn 27, 7 on 28, ..., down to 0 on turn 35? Better to think: at turn t, life span L, it will be gone after L turns, so on turn t + L, it disappears. Since it decreases on the current turn, after turn 26, life span becomes 8, so after 9 decreases, it's gone. Initial life span 9 at turn 26, after one turn (turn 27), life span 8, ..., after k turns, life span 9-k. So when 9-k = 0, k=9, so on turn 26 + 9 = 35, it disappears. On turn 35, before any action, life span would be 0, so it's gone. But we can eat it on turns when life span >0, so up to turn 34.\n\nTurn 26: life span 9\n\nTurn 27: life span 8\n\n...\n\nTurn 34: life span 1\n\nTurn 35: life span 0, food gone.\n\nSo we can eat it from turn 26 to 34, but since it's under the tail, we need to access it when it's free.\n\nNow, current head position: (5,1), moving left. Last move was left, so from where? Positions: head (5,1), then (6,1), so it came from right, moving left to (5,1). Head direction is L, so it's facing left.\n\nPossible moves: since head direction is L (left), we can move L, U, D, but not R, because reverse is not allowed. Reverse would be right, but since we're moving left, right is opposite, so we cannot move right on next turn. Directions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1).\n\nCurrent head: (5,1)\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Left (L): to (4,1) — but x=4, y=1\n\n- Up (U): to (5,2) — y+1, so (5,1+1)=(5,2)\n\n- Down (D): to (5,0) — but y=0 is a wall, since border y=0 is wall. Walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are borders. Also internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nSo down to (5,0): y=0, which is wall, so invalid, collision.\n\nLeft to (4,1): is this free? Let's see if occupied by body or wall.\n\nBody positions: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5). (4,1) is not in this list, and not a wall? Walls are borders and (5,6). (4,1) x=4, y=1, which is within 0 to 7, not border, not obstacle, so should be free.\n\nGrid: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. (4,1) is inside, no wall there.\n\nUp to (5,2): (5,2) is not in body positions? Body has (6,2), (5,3), etc., not (5,2). (5,2) should be free.\n\nDown to (5,0): y=0, wall, invalid.\n\nRight: but reverse not allowed, since current direction left, moving right would be opposite, so not possible.\n\nSo possible moves from (5,1): Left to (4,1) or Up to (5,2).\n\nNow, we need to think multiple turns ahead to get to the food at (2,5).\n\nFood is at (2,5), which is currently occupied by tail.\n\nThe tail will move when the snake moves. Since the snake moves one step, the tail moves forward.\n\nCurrent tail is at (2,5). When the snake moves, the head moves to a new position, and the tail moves to the next segment? No, in snake, when the snake moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail end is removed, unless it eats food.\n\nNormally, without eating, head moves to new cell, tail is removed from the end.\n\nBut if it eats food, head moves to food cell, tail doesn't remove, so snake grows by one.\n\nBut here, food is under tail, so we need to move so that the tail moves away, freeing (2,5), and then head moves to (2,5) to eat it.\n\nBut Tail Reward Danger only if head adjacent to tail when eating.\n\nCurrently, head (5,1) and tail (2,5) are not adjacent.\n\nTo eat the food at (2,5), we need to have the head at (2,5) when it is free and has food.\n\nSince the food is under tail, after the tail moves, (2,5) becomes free and has food, but only if life span is still there.\n\nBut when the tail moves, the cell (2,5) is vacated, and since food is there, it should be available to eat, but only if head moves onto it later.\n\nThe food can be eaten only if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\n\nIn this case, when the tail moves away from (2,5), the food is exposed, and then if head moves to (2,5), it can eat it.\n\nBut we need to time it so that when head moves to (2,5), the food is still there.\n\nAlso, after moving, the snake body changes.\n\nLet me sketch the grid.\n\nGrid 8x8, x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders and (5,6).\n\nSnake positions: head (5,1), then:\n\n- (6,1)  // body\n\n- (6,2)\n\n- (6,3)\n\n- (5,3)\n\n- (4,3)\n\n- (4,4)\n\n- (5,4)\n\n- (5,5)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (3,5)\n\n- (2,5)  // tail\n\nNow, the snake is moving, so let's see the path. From (5,1) to (6,1) to (6,2) to (6,3) to (5,3) to (4,3) to (4,4) to (5,4) to (5,5) to (4,5) to (3,5) to (2,5). It seems like the snake has a bend.\n\nCurrent head at (5,1), moving left, so to (4,1) or up to (5,2).\n\nFood at (2,5), which is tail.\n\nWe need to get to (2,5) to eat the food when it's free.\n\nFirst, how to free (2,5)? When the snake moves, the tail moves to the next segment, which is (3,5), so (2,5) is vacated.\n\nCurrent tail is (2,5), and the segment before tail is (3,5), so when snake moves without eating, tail moves to (3,5), and (2,5) is free.\n\nThen, if head moves to (2,5) later, it can eat the food there.\n\nBut after moving, the new tail is (3,5), and (2,5) is free with food.\n\nNow, the head is at (5,1), which is far from (2,5). We need to navigate to (2,5) without dying.\n\nAlso, the food has life span 9, so we have until turn 34 to eat it.\n\nBut we should do it as soon as possible to avoid risks, but since it's positive food, we want to eat it, but we have to plan the path.\n\nMoreover, after eating, the snake grows, so we need to avoid colliding with itself.\n\nFirst, let's think about the immediate move.\n\nPossible moves: from (5,1) to (4,1) or (5,2).\n\nIf we go left to (4,1): then head at (4,1), and tail moves to (3,5), so (2,5) is free with food.\n\nNew positions: head (4,1), then body: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) — tail is (3,5).\n\n(2,5) is free with food.\n\nIf we go up to (5,2): head at (5,2), body: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), tail (2,5) — but after move, tail moves to (3,5), so (2,5) free.\n\nIn both cases, after one move, (2,5) is free with food.\n\nBut the head is not at (2,5); it's at either (4,1) or (5,2).\n\nNow, we need to get from there to (2,5).\n\nDistance: from (4,1) to (2,5): delta x = -2, delta y = +4, so Manhattan distance 6.\n\nFrom (5,2) to (2,5): delta x = -3, delta y = +3, distance 6.\n\nBut we have to move through the grid, avoiding walls and body.\n\nAlso, after moving, the body changes as the snake moves.\n\nMoreover, we need to consider that when we move to eat the food, we should not be adjacent to the tail if the food is on tail cell, but in this case, when we eat at (2,5), it won't be the tail anymore; it will be a free cell with food.\n\nThe Tail Reward Danger is only if we eat when the food is on the tail cell and head adjacent to tail.\n\nBut when we move to (2,5) to eat, if it was the tail, but by the time we move there, tail has moved, so it's not tail anymore.\n\nIn this case, after first move, (2,5) is free, not occupied, so no issue.\n\nThe danger is only if at the moment of eating, the food is on the tail cell and head is adjacent to it, which causes collision after growth.\n\nBut here, when we eat at (2,5), it is not the tail; it's a food cell.\n\nSo no Tail Reward Danger for this food.\n\nNow, to eat the food, we need to get to (2,5) before turn 35.\n\nBut we should plan a path.\n\nAlso, there might be other food, but in this state, only one food is given, at (2,5).\n\nThe food list has only one: (2,5,9,1)\n\nSo only one food on the board.\n\nWe need to eat it to grow and score.\n\nBut we have to avoid risks, so we need a safe path.\n\nFirst, let's list the current occupied cells after one move, but it depends on the move.\n\nAlso, walls: borders, so (0,y), (7,y), (x,0), (x,7) are walls, and (5,6) is obstacle.\n\nInternal obstacle (5,6) is a wall cell.\n\nNow, let's consider the two options for turn 26.\n\nOption 1: Move Left to (4,1)\n\nThen new head at (4,1), direction now L (since we moved left).\n\nBody: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) — tail at (3,5).\n\n(2,5) is free with food.\n\nOption 2: Move Up to (5,2)\n\nNew head at (5,2), direction U (up).\n\nBody: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) — tail at (3,5), (2,5) free.\n\nNow, from here, we need to go to (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is at x=2,y=5.\n\nFrom (4,1) or (5,2), we need to move towards (2,5).\n\nBut there might be body in the way.\n\nFirst, let's see the grid state after one move.\n\nAssume we move left to (4,1) on turn 26.\n\nThen on turn 27, head at (4,1), direction L.\n\nPossible moves from (4,1):\n\n- Left (L) to (3,1)\n\n- Up (U) to (4,2)\n\n- Down (D) to (4,0) — but y=0 wall, invalid\n\n- Right (R) — but current direction L, right is reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo can go to (3,1) or (4,2).\n\n(3,1): is it free? Body positions: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5). (3,1) not in list, so free.\n\n(4,2) not in body, free.\n\nSimilarly, if we had gone up to (5,2), on turn 27 head at (5,2), dir U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (5,3), but (5,3) is body? Current body after move: positions include (5,3)? After moving up to (5,2), body is (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), etc.\n\n(5,3) is a body segment, so cannot move there.\n\nBody: after head to (5,2), the segments are: head (5,2), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)\n\n(6,2) is body, but when head moves to (5,2), the body shifts: the new body starts from the old head position.\n\nOld positions: head (5,1), body (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\nAfter moving head to new position, say (5,2), then the new body is: the previous head (5,1) becomes the first body segment, then (6,1), then (6,2), then (6,3), then (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), and tail (2,5) is removed, so new tail is (3,5).\n\nPositions: new head (5,2), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) — 12 segments, tail (3,5).\n\n(2,5) vacated.\n\nNow, from (5,2), possible moves:\n\n- U to (5,3): but (5,3) is occupied by body, as above, (5,3) is in the body list.\n\n- D to (5,1): (5,1) is also body, occupied.\n\n- L to (4,2): (4,2) is not in body positions, so free.\n\n- R to (6,2): (6,2) is body, occupied.\n\nAlso, direction: current head direction is U (since we moved up), so reverse is D, which is down, but we can move U, L, R, but U and R are invalid because occupied, D is reverse and also occupied, but D is invalid because reverse and occupied, but the reverse rule is separate.\n\nCannot move reverse, so from current dir U, cannot move D.\n\nAnd U to (5,3) occupied, R to (6,2) occupied, so only possible move is L to (4,2).\n\nIs that right? Moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nU: (5,3) occupied\n\nD: reverse, not allowed, and also (5,1) occupied\n\nL: (4,2) free\n\nR: (6,2) occupied\n\nSo only left to (4,2) is possible.\n\nTherefore, if we move up on turn 26, on turn 27 we must move left to (4,2), no choice.\n\nThen from there, we can continue.\n\nBut let's compare to moving left first.\n\nFirst, let's aim for the food.\n\nThe food is at (2,5), and it's safe to eat there once we can reach it.\n\nBut we need to avoid getting trapped.\n\nAlso, after eating, the snake grows, so we need space.\n\nBut first, let's find a path to (2,5).\n\nFrom current position (5,1), if we move left to (4,1), then to (3,1), then to (2,1), then to (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5).\n\nBut let's check if these cells are free.\n\nFirst, after moving to (4,1) on turn 26.\n\nTurn 26: move L to (4,1)\n\nNew state: head (4,1), dir L\n\nBody: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)  // tail (3,5)\n\n(2,5) free with food.\n\nNow turn 27: from (4,1), can move L to (3,1) or U to (4,2)\n\n(3,1) and (4,2) should be free.\n\nSay we move L to (3,1)\n\nThen head (3,1), dir L\n\nBody: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)  // tail? After move, new body: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), and previous tail (3,5) removed, so new tail is (4,5)? Positions: head (3,1), then previous head (4,1), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5) — so tail is (4,5)\n\n(3,5) was tail, removed, so (4,5) is new tail? Let's list indices.\n\nAfter turn 26: positions: head (4,1), body segments: 1:(5,1), 2:(6,1), 3:(6,2), 4:(6,3), 5:(5,3), 6:(4,3), 7:(4,4), 8:(5,4), 9:(5,5), 10:(4,5), 11:(3,5) — so 11 body segments, but with head, 12 cells.\n\nAfter move to (3,1) on turn 27: new head (3,1), new body: the old head becomes first body, so (4,1), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), and the last tail (3,5) is removed, so no (3,5), tail is (4,5).\n\n(4,5) is the last.\n\nNow (2,5) is still free with food.\n\nFrom (3,1), we can move L to (2,1), or U to (3,2), or D to (3,0) but y=0 wall, or R to (4,1) but occupied.\n\nCurrent dir L, so cannot move R (reverse).\n\nPossible: L to (2,1), U to (3,2), D invalid.\n\n(2,1) and (3,2) should be free.\n\nMove L to (2,1) on turn 27? Turn 27 is from (4,1) to (3,1), then turn 28 from (3,1).\n\nLet's sequence.\n\nTurn 26: move to (4,1)\n\nTurn 27: move to (3,1) or (4,2)\n\nSuppose turn 27: move to (3,1)\n\nThen turn 28: head at (3,1), dir L (since moved left)\n\nCan move L to (2,1), U to (3,2), D invalid.\n\n(2,1) free? No body there, yes.\n\nMove L to (2,1) on turn 28.\n\nHead (2,1), dir L\n\nBody: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)  // tail? After move, new body: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), and tail was (4,5), removed? Previous positions after turn 27: head (3,1), body (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5) — tail (4,5)\n\nAfter move to (2,1): new head (2,1), body (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5) — and (4,5) removed, so tail (5,5)\n\n(5,5) is tail.\n\nNow head at (2,1), we need to go to (2,5).\n\nSo move up repeatedly.\n\nFrom (2,1), can move U to (2,2), or since dir L, can also move D, but y=0 invalid, or R to (3,1) occupied, or U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,2), or L to (1,1), but x=1, or R not allowed reverse.\n\nDir L, so can move L, U, D.\n\nD invalid, so U to (2,2) or L to (1,1).\n\n(2,2) should be free, (1,1) is within grid, not wall.\n\nBut we want to go up to (2,5), so move U.\n\nTurn 29: move U to (2,2)\n\nHead (2,2), dir U (up)\n\nBody: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)  // tail? After move, body: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), and (5,5) removed, tail (5,4)? Positions: head (2,2), body (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4) — tail (5,4)\n\n(2,5) still free.\n\nFrom (2,2), move U to (2,3)\n\nTurn 30: move U to (2,3)\n\nHead (2,3), dir U\n\nBody: (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)  // tail? After move: body (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), and (5,4) removed, tail (4,4)\n\n(2,3) is head, but is (2,3) free? Before move, (2,3) was not occupied? In previous state, positions had (4,3), (4,4), etc., not (2,3), so yes free.\n\nNow, (2,3) to (2,4) or (2,5), but need to check.\n\nMove U to (2,4) on turn 31.\n\nHead (2,4), dir U\n\nBody: (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)  // tail (4,3)? After move: body (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), and (4,4) removed, tail (4,3)\n\n(2,4) to (2,5): (2,5) has food, we can move there.\n\nTurn 32: move U to (2,5)\n\nNow, (2,5) has food, so we eat it, snake grows.\n\nHead moves to (2,5), eats food, so tail does not move, snake length increases.\n\nNew head at (2,5), and the body includes the previous head (2,4), so positions: head (2,5), then (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) — and since we ate, no removal, so length 13 now.\n\nPrevious tail was (4,3), but since ate, it stays.\n\nBefore move: head at (2,4), body (2,3), (2,2), ..., up to (4,3) as tail.\n\nAfter eating at (2,5): head (2,5), then (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) — all segments, no removal.\n\nNow, what about the food? It was eaten, so gone.\n\nNow, is this safe? We need to check if we collide.\n\nHead at (2,5), body has (2,4), (2,3), etc., so (2,5) is not occupied by body before move, and after move, head is there, but body is behind.\n\nNo collision.\n\nAlso, walls: (2,5) is not wall.\n\nSo we ate the food on turn 32.\n\nBut life span was 9 at turn 26, so on turn 32, how many turns passed? From 26 to 32 is 6 turns, so life span decreased by 6, from 9 to 3, still >0, so ok.\n\nTurn 26: life span 9\n\nAfter turn 26, before turn 27, life span 8? The rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo on turn 26, when we start, life span is 9.\n\nAfter turn 26 action, before turn 27, life span decreases to 8.\n\nSimilarly, after turn 27, to 7, and so on.\n\nAfter turn k, life span decreases by k - 26 +1? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 26, before action, life span=9.\n\nAfter action, life span decreases to 8 (for the next state).\n\nThen after turn 27 action, to 7, etc.\n\nAfter turn 31 action, before turn 32, life span = 9 - (32 - 26) = 9 - 6 = 3? Turns from 26 to 31: 6 actions? Turn 26,27,28,29,30,31: that's 6 turns, so after turn 31, life span = 9 - 6 = 3.\n\nThen on turn 32, we move to (2,5) and eat, before action, life span=3>0, so we can eat.\n\nAfter eating, food gone.\n\nIn this path, we ate on turn 32.\n\nNow, but we need to think if this path is safe.\n\nIn the moves, we went to (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5).\n\nAll these cells were free at the time of move.\n\nBut when we move to (2,1) on turn 28, for example, what is the body?\n\nAfter turn 27: head (3,1), body (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5) — tail (4,5)\n\n(2,1) not in body.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2) not in body, etc.\n\nNow, after eating at (2,5), the snake is at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)\n\nHead at (2,5), direction U (since last move up).\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,6), D to (2,4) but reverse? Current dir U, reverse D not allowed.\n\nL to (1,5), R to (3,5), or U to (2,6)\n\n(2,4) is body, so D invalid anyway.\n\nU to (2,6): y=6, within 0-7, not wall? Walls y=7 is border, y=6 is ok.\n\nBut (2,6) is free? Not occupied yet.\n\nL to (1,5): x=1, free.\n\nR to (3,5): (3,5) was body? In current positions, (3,5) is not there; positions are up to (4,3), so (3,5) might be free.\n\nList: head (2,5), then (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)\n\nSo (3,5) not occupied, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) free, (2,6) free.\n\nSo we can move.\n\nBut we need to survive after that.\n\nNow, what about the other option: moving up first.\n\nIf on turn 26 we move up to (5,2)\n\nThen as before, on turn 27 we must move left to (4,2), because only possible move.\n\nTurn 26: move U to (5,2), dir U\n\nThen turn 27: from (5,2), only possible move L to (4,2)\n\nHead (4,2), dir L (since moved left)\n\nBody: after turn 26 move: head (5,2), body (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) — tail (3,5)\n\nAfter move to (4,2): new head (4,2), body (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5) — and (3,5) removed, tail (4,5)\n\n(2,5) free with food.\n\nFrom (4,2), we need to go to (2,5).\n\nPossible moves: from (4,2), dir L, so can move L to (3,2), U to (4,3), D to (4,1), or R not allowed reverse.\n\n(4,3) is body, occupied.\n\n(4,1) is free? Not in body, yes.\n\n(3,2) free.\n\nSo can move L to (3,2) or D to (4,1).\n\nTo go to (2,5), better to go left or up.\n\nSay move L to (3,2) on turn 28.\n\nHead (3,2), dir L\n\nBody: (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)  // tail? After move: body (4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), and (4,5) removed, tail (5,5)\n\nThen from (3,2), move L to (2,2) on turn 29? But (2,2) should be free.\n\nThen to (2,3), (2,4), (2,5).\n\nSimilar to before.\n\nBut from (3,2) to (2,2) to (2,3) etc., might take more turns.\n\nTurn 29: move L to (2,2)\n\nHead (2,2), dir L\n\nThen turn 30: move U to (2,3)\n\nTurn 31: U to (2,4)\n\nTurn 32: U to (2,5) eat.\n\nSame as before, eat on turn 32.\n\nBut in the first path, by moving left first, we can reach (2,1) earlier, but we still go up to (2,5) on turn 32.\n\nIn both cases, we can eat on turn 32.\n\nBut in the first path, when we go to (4,1) then (3,1) then (2,1), we are going down and left, which might be safer or not.\n\nIn the second path, by going up first to (5,2), then left to (4,2), then to (3,2), (2,2), etc., we are at y=2, which is closer to y=5.\n\nBut in terms of turns, same.\n\nNow, is there a faster way? For example, from (5,1) move left to (4,1), then on turn 27 move up to (4,2), then to (4,3)? But (4,3) is body.\n\nAfter turn 26 move to (4,1), body has (4,3), which is occupied.\n\nOn turn 27, from (4,1), we can move to (4,2), which is free.\n\nThen head (4,2), dir U (if we moved up? From (4,1) to (4,2) is up, so dir U.\n\nThen body: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)  // tail (4,5)\n\n(4,3) is occupied.\n\nFrom (4,2), can move U to (4,3), but (4,3) occupied, cannot.\n\nL to (3,2), R not allowed (reverse? dir U, reverse D not allowed), D to (4,1) occupied.\n\nSo only possible moves: U, L, D, but U occupied, D occupied, so only L to (3,2).\n\nThen same as before.\n\nSo no direct way.\n\nThus, the path to (2,5) takes about 6 moves: from turn 26 to 32.\n\nTurn 26: start at (5,1)\n\nAfter move, to new position.\n\nThen after 6 moves, on turn 32, we can be at (2,5) to eat.\n\nIn the sequence above, we ate on turn 32.\n\nBut we need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe answer should be for turns starting from t1=26.\n\nBut we need to think 5+ turns ahead, and prioritize survival.\n\nIn this path, we are going to (2,1) which is near the wall, but since we go up to (2,5), it might be ok.\n\nBut after eating at (2,5), the snake is vertical from (2,1) to (2,5), and then we need to move, say, right or left.\n\nBut there might be risks.\n\nSince we have to maximize score, and only one food, we should eat it.\n\nBut is there negative food? No, only this one positive food.\n\nSo we should go for it.\n\nNow, but in the initial move, if we move up first, we might have a problem because from (5,2), we are forced to move left, and then to (4,2), etc.\n\nBut in both cases, we can reach.\n\nBut let's see if moving left first is better for survival.\n\nMoving left to (4,1) might be safer because we are moving away from the body cluster.\n\nThe body is mostly on the right and upper rows.\n\nAt (5,1), moving left to (4,1) goes towards left wall, but since we turn up, it might be fine.\n\nMoving up to (5,2) brings us closer to the body, like (5,3) is body, so we have to move left immediately.\n\nIn terms of space, going left might open more space.\n\nAfter eating, the snake will be long, and we need to find a way out.\n\nFor example, from (2,5), we can move right to (3,5), which should be free after eating.\n\nIn the state after eating, positions: (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)\n\n(3,5) is free, as before.\n\nSo we can move to (3,5), then to (4,5), etc.\n\nBut there might be other food later, but for now, only one.\n\nNow, back to turn 26 decision.\n\nIf we move left to (4,1), we can proceed as above.\n\nIf we move up to (5,2), we must move left to (4,2) on turn 27, then to (3,2), (2,2), etc.\n\nIn the up-first path, on turn 32 we eat at (2,5), same as left-first.\n\nBut in left-first, we went through (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), then up.\n\nIn up-first, we go to (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), then up to (2,5).\n\nBoth take 6 moves to eat.\n\nBut in left-first, when we go to (2,1), it might be closer to the wall, but since we move up, it should be ok.\n\nTo avoid the corner, perhaps moving up first is better, but (5,2) is higher.\n\nBut I think both are viable.\n\nNow, the problem is to output actions for multiple turns, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and output for several turns.\n\nAnswer format: boxed with actions for turn t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nBut how many turns? It doesn't specify, but since we are to think ahead, probably output a sequence until we eat or something.\n\nBut in this case, we can plan to eat on turn 32.\n\nBut turn 32 is 6 turns from now, so t1=26 to t1+6=32.\n\nBut we might not need to output all, but let's see.\n\nPerhaps we can output until the action that eats the food.\n\nBut the format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so we should output a sequence.\n\nSince the food life span is long, we could take a different path, but the direct path seems fine.\n\nAnother thing: when we move to (2,5) to eat, we need to ensure we don't have Tail Reward Danger, but as we discussed, it's not the case.\n\nIn this path, when we eat at (2,5), the tail is at (4,3), not adjacent.\n\n|2-4|=2, |5-3|=2, not adjacent.\n\nSo safe.\n\nNow, for the sequence, let's write it for the left-first option.\n\nTurn 26: move L to (4,1)\n\nThen turn 27: from (4,1), we can move L to (3,1) or U to (4,2)\n\nIn the path to food, we moved L to (3,1), but we could move U to (4,2) to go directly, but from (4,2), we can go to (3,2), etc., similar.\n\nBut to minimize time, going L to (3,1) then to (2,1) is direct left.\n\nFrom (4,1) to (3,1) to (2,1) is efficient.\n\nThen up.\n\nSo let's do that.\n\nSo for turn 26: L\n\nThen turn 27: L to (3,1)\n\nTurn 28: L to (2,1)\n\nTurn 29: U to (2,2)  // now dir U\n\nTurn 30: U to (2,3)\n\nTurn 31: U to (2,4)\n\nTurn 32: U to (2,5) and eat.\n\nIn the sequence, on turn 32 we eat.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to output actions starting from turn 26.\n\nBut we might not need all, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", output 5 or 6 actions.\n\nTurn 26 to turn 31 is 6 turns, or up to 32.\n\nBut let's confirm the directions.\n\nAt turn 26: head at (5,1), dir L, move L to (4,1), so after move, dir is L.\n\nTurn 27: head at (4,1), dir L, move L to (3,1), so after move, dir L.\n\nTurn 28: head at (3,1), dir L, move L to (2,1), after move, dir L.\n\nNow at (2,1), dir L, but we want to move up, so move U to (2,2), which is allowed since not reverse.\n\nAfter move, dir U.\n\nTurn 29: head (2,2), dir U, move U to (2,3), dir U.\n\nTurn 30: head (2,3), dir U, move U to (2,4), dir U.\n\nTurn 31: head (2,4), dir U, move U to (2,5), eat.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 26: L\n\nTurn 27: L\n\nTurn 28: L\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U  // to (2,4)\n\nThen on turn 32: U to (2,5), but if we output up to turn 31, that might be enough, or include turn 32.\n\nSince eating is on turn 32 action, we can include it.\n\nBut the output should be for the actions we decide now.\n\nSince we think ahead, we can output the sequence to achieve the goal.\n\nPerhaps for 5 turns: turn 26 to 30.\n\nBut on turn 30 we are at (2,3), not yet eaten.\n\nTo be complete, let's output until turn 31 or 32.\n\nThe format doesn't specify how many, but in the example, it might be implied.\n\nSince food life span is 9, we have time, but the direct path is fine.\n\nAnother thing: in the grid, there is an internal obstacle at (5,6), which is not in our path, so no issue.\n\nAlso, after eating, we need to survive, but for now, we focus on getting the food.\n\nI think moving left first is a good choice.\n\nIf we move up first, we have only one choice on turn 27, which is L to (4,2), then we can go to (3,2), (2,2), etc., but it might be slightly slower or same.\n\nFor example, turn 26: U to (5,2)\n\nTurn 27: L to (4,2)\n\nTurn 28: L to (3,2)  // from (4,2) to (3,2), dir L\n\nTurn 29: L to (2,2)\n\nTurn 30: U to (2,3)\n\nTurn 31: U to (2,4)\n\nTurn 32: U to (2,5) eat.\n\nSame number of turns.\n\nBut in this case, on turn 28, we move to (3,2), which is higher than (2,1), but similar.\n\nI think left-first is fine.\n\nTo output the actions.\n\nSo for turn 26: L\n\nThen we need to specify the sequence.\n\nBut in the sequence above, for left-first, turns 26 to 32.\n\nBut perhaps output for 5+ turns, so up to turn 31.\n\nThen on turn 31, we are at (2,4), and we move to (2,5) on turn 32.\n\nBut since the answer format is to list actions, we can list from turn 26 to, say, turn 30 or 31.\n\nI think it's reasonable to output until the point we eat, but turn 32 is t1+6.\n\nSince t1=26, output up to t1+5=31.\n\nThen on turn 31, we move to (2,4), and on turn 32 we eat, but not in the sequence.\n\nTo be safe, let's output the actions that lead to eating.\n\nPerhaps the AI should output the planned actions for the next few turns.\n\nI think for this, we can output:\n\nTurn 26: L\n\nTurn 27: L\n\nTurn 28: L\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U  // to (2,4)\n\nThen implicitly, on turn 32: U to eat.\n\nBut since we output up to turn 31, it's fine.\n\nTo include eating, but turn 32 is extra.\n\nI think it's ok.\n\nNow, in the move to (2,1), at (2,1), we are near x=0 wall, but x=2>0, and we move up, so no problem.\n\nAnother thing: when we move to (2,1) on turn 28, what is the body? Earlier, it should be free.\n\nTo confirm safety, let's simulate quickly.\n\nAfter turn 26 move L to (4,1): positions head (4,1), body (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) tail.\n\n(2,5) free.\n\nTurn 27 move L to (3,1): head (3,1), body (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5) tail. (3,5) removed.\n\n(2,5) still free.\n\nTurn 28 move L to (2,1): head (2,1), body (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5) tail. (4,5) removed.\n\n(2,1) is free, no issue.\n\nThen move U to (2,2): head (2,2), body (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4) tail.\n\n(2,2) free.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nAll safe.\n\nTherefore, the sequence can be:\n\nTurn 26: L\n\nTurn 27: L\n\nTurn 28: L\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nAnd then turn 32: U to eat, but not listed.\n\nFor the box, we can list these.\n\nSince we are to think 5 turns ahead, output 5 actions: turn 26 to 30.\n\nThen on turn 30, we are at (2,3), and we need to go to (2,4) and (2,5).\n\nBut with 5 actions, it's turn 26 to 30: L,L,L,U,U\n\nThen on turn 30, head at (2,3), dir U, then we can go U to (2,4), etc.\n\nBut not complete to eating.\n\nI think outputting 6 actions to include up to turn 31 is fine.\n\nTurn 31: U to (2,4)\n\nThen eating on next turn.\n\nPerhaps it's acceptable.\n\nTo match the \"5+ turns\", 6 is plus.\n\nI think we should go with this.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating the positive food at (2,5) while ensuring long-term survival, a sequence of moves is planned to reach the food by turn 32. The food has a life span of 9, decreasing to 3 by turn 32, allowing it to be eaten safely. The path avoids collisions with walls, obstacles, and the snake's body, and leverages the fact that the tail will move away from (2,5) after the first move, freeing the cell for the head to eat the food later. Tail Reward Danger does not apply here, as the head is not adjacent to the tail when eating.\n\nThe planned moves:\n- **Turn 26**: Move left (L) to (4,1). This moves away from the body cluster and towards the left wall, freeing (2,5) for future access.\n- **Turn 27**: Move left (L) to (3,1). Continues the path leftward, maintaining distance from the body.\n- **Turn 28**: Move left (L) to (2,1). Positions the snake near the left wall for an upward turn.\n- **Turn 29**: Move up (U) to (2,2). Begins the ascent toward y=5.\n- **Turn 30**: Move up (U) to (2,3). Progresses upward, avoiding the body.\n- **Turn 31**: Move up (U) to (2,4). Final position before eating the food.\n\nOn turn 32, moving up (U) to (2,5) will eat the food, growing the snake by one segment. This sequence ensures the food is eaten with minimal risk, as all moves are to free cells and avoid reverse direction violations. After eating, the snake can navigate to open areas (e.g., moving right to (3,5)) for continued survival.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 26: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 27: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 28: L (left) \\\\\nTurn 29: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 30: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 31: U (up)\n}",

That means the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), so it's 8 units wide and high, with coordinates from 0 to 7 inclusive.\n\nInternal obstacle: (5,6)\n\nSnake positions: head is (4,1), then (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5). That's 12 segments. Let me list them in order:\n\n1. Head: (4,1)\n\n2. (5,1)\n\n3. (6,1)\n\n4. (6,2)\n\n5. (6,3)\n\n6. (5,3)\n\n7. (4,3)\n\n8. (4,4)\n\n9. (5,4)\n\n10. (5,5)\n\n11. (4,5)\n\n12. (3,5)  // tail\n\nSnake head direction is L, which means left, so it was moving left when it was at (4,1). But on turn t1=27, I need to decide the next move.\n\nFood: only one food given: (2,5) with value 1 and life span 8. So it's positive food, +1, and it disappears after 8 turns, including the current turn. Since current turn is 27, it will disappear after turn 34? Life span decreases every turn, including current, so if life span is 8 at turn 27, after turn 27, it becomes 7, and so on, until turn 27 + 7 = 34, after which it disappears. At turn 27, life span is 8, so it will be present for turns 27,28,29,30,31,32,33, and disappear before turn 34. So last chance to eat is turn 33.\n\nNow, the food is at (2,5). Looking at snake positions, (3,5) is the tail, and (4,5) is the 11th segment? Positions: ... (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) tail. So (3,5) is tail, and food is at (2,5), which is adjacent to tail.\n\nBut food is at (2,5), and tail is at (3,5), so they are adjacent horizontally.\n\nHead is at (4,1), which is far from (2,5). Current head position is (4,1), food at (2,5).\n\nI need to move the snake to eat this food if possible, but I have to avoid risks and think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: border cells x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So cannot move to those.\n\nInternal obstacle: (5,6), so that cell is blocked.\n\nSnake body: let's list all occupied cells by snake:\n\n(4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)\n\nNow, food at (2,5) with value 1, life span 8.\n\nHead direction is L, meaning it was moving left to reach (4,1) from previous position. Since head is at (4,1) and direction is L, previous head was probably at (5,1) or something, but let's see the positions: positions are given as list, head first, so before moving, head was at some position, moved left to (4,1). But for movement, I need to choose next direction.\n\nMovement constraints: I can move U, D, L, R, but no instant reverse. Since current head direction is L, I cannot move R (right) immediately, because that would be opposite direction.\n\nCurrent head direction is L, so last move was left. Therefore, I cannot move right on this turn because it would be instant reverse.\n\nAllowed moves: since direction is L, I can move U (up), D (down), or continue L (left), but not R (right).\n\nNow, head position (4,1). Possible moves:\n\n- U: to (4,2)\n\n- D: to (4,0) but y=0 is wall, so invalid.\n\n- L: to (3,1)\n\n- R: to (5,1) but (5,1) is occupied by snake body, the second segment. Also, moving right is opposite to current left direction, so not allowed anyway.\n\nD to (4,0): y=0 is wall, so cannot move there.\n\nSo possible moves from (4,1):\n\n- U: (4,2) – is this free? Let's see occupied cells.\n\nSnake body: (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5)\n\nSo (4,2) is not in this list, so it might be free. Also, not a wall.\n\n- L: (3,1) – not in snake positions, and x=3, y=1 should be within bounds? x=3, y=1, min x=0, y=0, but y=0 is wall, but (3,1) is not wall, walls only at borders. x=0 and x=7 are walls, y=0 and y=7 are walls. (3,1): x=3 not 0 or 7, y=1 not 0 or 7, so valid. Not occupied, so free.\n\n- D: (4,0) is y=0, wall, invalid.\n\n- R: (5,1) is occupied by snake, and also opposite direction, invalid.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (4,2) or L to (3,1).\n\nNow, I need to think about getting to the food at (2,5).\n\nFood is at (2,5), head at (4,1), so I need to move towards there.\n\nBut there are obstacles and the snake body.\n\nAlso, the food is near the tail at (3,5).\n\nTail is at (3,5), food at (2,5), so if I can get the head to (2,5) when the tail has moved away, but it's complicated.\n\nI should plan a path to (2,5).\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid.\n\nI'll make a grid representation.\n\nRows y from 0 to 7, columns x from 0 to 7.\n\ny=0 and y=7 are walls.\n\nx=0 and x=7 are walls.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nSnake:\n\nHead: (4,1)\n\nThen: (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5) tail.\n\nSo let's list occupied cells:\n\n- (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)  // bottom row\n\n- (6,2), (6,3)        // right side\n\n- (5,3), (4,3)        // middle\n\n- (4,4), (5,4)        //\n\n- (5,5), (4,5)        //\n\n- (3,5) tail\n\nFood at (2,5)\n\nFree cells: for example, (4,2) is free, (3,1) is free, etc.\n\nNow, from (4,1), I can go U to (4,2) or L to (3,1).\n\nI need to think multiple moves ahead.\n\nAlso, the food has life span 8, so I have until turn 33 to eat it, since at turn 27, life=8, decreases each turn, so after 8 turns, it's gone. Turn 27: life=8, after turn 27, life=7 (turn 28), ..., after turn 33: life=1? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn t, food has life span N, it means it will disappear after N more turns, including the current one.\n\nSo at turn 27, life span=8, so it is present on turns 27,28,29,30,31,32,33. After turn 33, before turn 34, it disappears. So I can eat it on any turn from 27 to 33 inclusive.\n\nNow, current turn is 27, head at (4,1), food at (2,5).\n\nManhattan distance: |4-2| + |1-5| = 2 + 4 = 6, so at least 6 moves away, but with obstacles, might be more.\n\nBut I have up to turn 33, which is 6 turns from now? Turn 27 to 33 is 7 turns: 27,28,29,30,31,32,33. So 7 opportunities, but I need to reach by turn 33.\n\nFrom turn 27 to turn 33, there are 6 moves: after turn 27 move, position at turn 28, and so on, up to after turn 33 move, but eating happens when head moves to food cell.\n\nIf I move to food on turn t, I eat it at that turn.\n\nSo to eat by turn 33, I need to be able to reach (2,5) by move on turn 33.\n\nFrom turn 27, I can make moves on turn 27,28,29,30,31,32,33 — that's 7 moves.\n\nCurrent position (4,1), target (2,5), difference dx= -2, dy= +4, so I need to move left and up.\n\nBut there might be shorter paths.\n\nNow, the issue is the tail is at (3,5), and food at (2,5), so if I eat (2,5), the snake grows, so new tail will be added, but since I eat, the segment is added at head, so tail doesn't move immediately, but after move.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat, you grow, so after moving to food, the tail doesn't advance that turn, so snake length increases.\n\nIn this case, if head moves to (2,5) when food is there, it eats, and snake grows, so the tail stays in place for that turn, meaning the new segment is added at head position, so tail position remains the same until next move.\n\nBut here, tail is at (3,5), adjacent to (2,5).\n\nThere's a special rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nThe food is at (2,5), not at the tail cell. Tail cell is (3,5), which has no food. Food is at (2,5), separate cell.\n\nSo eating (2,5) should be fine, as long as head doesn't collide.\n\nBut (2,5) is adjacent to tail (3,5), but the food is not on the tail cell, it's on a different cell.\n\nThe rule says: \"if the tail cell has positive food\", meaning food on the same cell as tail.\n\nBut here, food is at (2,5), tail is at (3,5), different cells, so no problem.\n\nThe danger is only if food is on the tail cell itself, which isn't the case.\n\nSo I can safely eat (2,5) as long as I don't collide with body or walls.\n\nNow, to reach (2,5) from (4,1).\n\nPossible path: for example, go up to (4,2), then (4,3) but (4,3) is occupied by snake body.\n\n(4,3) is the 7th segment? Positions: (4,3) is part of body, so cannot go there.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3), (6,3) etc occupied.\n\nSo from (4,1), if I go U to (4,2), that is free.\n\nThen from (4,2), I can go U to (4,3) but occupied, or L to (3,2), or R to (5,2), or D to (4,1) but that's previous, not good.\n\n(4,2) to (3,2) or (5,2) or (4,3) but (4,3) occupied.\n\n(5,2) might be free? Let's see, snake positions: no (5,2), so probably free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2) free.\n\nFrom (4,1), if I go L to (3,1), then from there.\n\nBut let's think about the area near (2,5).\n\n(2,5) has food. Cells around: (2,4), (2,6), (1,5), (3,5). (3,5) is tail, (2,4), (2,6), (1,5) might be free or not.\n\n(1,5): x=1, y=5, not wall, not in snake positions, so free.\n\n(2,4): not in snake, free.\n\n(2,6): y=6, x=2, not wall, not in snake, free.\n\n(3,5) is tail.\n\nAlso, (4,5) is snake body, (5,5) etc.\n\nTo eat (2,5), I need to move head to (2,5) when it's free, which it is.\n\nBut when I move to (2,5), the tail might be at different position depending on when I arrive.\n\nSince the snake moves, the tail will move over time.\n\nI need to simulate the snake movement.\n\nFirst, let's decide on turn 27 move.\n\nPossible actions: U to (4,2) or L to (3,1).\n\nIf I go U to (4,2), then head at (4,2).\n\nThen body follows: new head at (4,2), then previous head (4,1) becomes second segment, and so on, tail (3,5) will move to the next position when the snake moves, but only if not eating.\n\nSince no food eaten, when I move to (4,2), the head moves to (4,2), the tail moves away from (3,5) to whatever the next segment is, but the tail segment is removed, so (3,5) becomes free after the move.\n\nSnake movement: when snake moves without eating, head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, so the tail segment is left, and a new cell is occupied at head.\n\nSpecifically, when moving, the head moves to a new cell, then each body segment shifts to the position of the previous segment, so the last segment (tail) is vacated.\n\nFor example, current positions: let's index them: S0: (4,1), S1: (5,1), S2: (6,1), S3: (6,2), S4: (6,3), S5: (5,3), S6: (4,3), S7: (4,4), S8: (5,4), S9: (5,5), S10: (4,5), S11: (3,5)\n\nAfter move, if head moves to new position, say (4,2), then new positions:\n\nNew S0: (4,2)  // head\n\nThen S1: old S0 = (4,1)\n\nS2: old S1 = (5,1)\n\nS3: old S2 = (6,1)\n\nS4: old S3 = (6,2)\n\nS5: old S4 = (6,3)\n\nS6: old S5 = (5,3)\n\nS7: old S6 = (4,3)\n\nS8: old S7 = (4,4)\n\nS9: old S8 = (5,4)\n\nS10: old S9 = (5,5)\n\nS11: old S10 = (4,5)  // new tail\n\nOld tail (3,5) is no longer occupied; it's free now.\n\nSimilarly, if I move left to (3,1), new head (3,1), then S1: (4,1), S2: (5,1), ..., S11: (4,5) or something.\n\nLet's not get ahead.\n\nFor turn 27, I need to choose move.\n\nBut I have to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score and survive.\n\nThere's only one food now, but more might spawn later, but the state doesn't say, so I think for now, only this food is present.\n\nThe food positions are given, and only one is listed, so I assume only this food for now.\n\nI should try to eat this food since it's positive.\n\nBut I need to avoid risks.\n\nFirst, let's see if I can reach (2,5) safely.\n\nFrom (4,1) to (2,5), I need to go left and up.\n\nBut directly up is blocked because (4,2) is free, but (4,3) is occupied, so I cannot go up to (4,3).\n\nSimilarly, left to (3,1) is free, then from (3,1), I can go U to (3,2), or L to (2,1), or R to (4,1) but (4,1) will be body after move, so occupied.\n\nAfter moving to (3,1), if I go from (4,1) to (3,1), then new positions: head (3,1), S1: (4,1), S2: (5,1), etc, up to S11: (4,5), tail at (4,5)? Old tail (3,5) is gone.\n\nOld positions: S0:(4,1), S1:(5,1), S2:(6,1), S3:(6,2), S4:(6,3), S5:(5,3), S6:(4,3), S7:(4,4), S8:(5,4), S9:(5,5), S10:(4,5), S11:(3,5)\n\nAfter move to (3,1):\n\nNew S0: (3,1)\n\nS1: old S0 = (4,1)\n\nS2: old S1 = (5,1)\n\nS3: old S2 = (6,1)\n\nS4: old S3 = (6,2)\n\nS5: old S4 = (6,3)\n\nS6: old S5 = (5,3)\n\nS7: old S6 = (4,3)\n\nS8: old S7 = (4,4)\n\nS9: old S8 = (5,4)\n\nS10: old S9 = (5,5)\n\nS11: old S10 = (4,5)  // new tail, so (3,5) is free now.\n\nSimilarly, if I go U to (4,2), new head (4,2), S1: (4,1), S2: (5,1), ..., S11: (4,5), tail at (4,5), and (3,5) free.\n\nIn both cases, (3,5) becomes free after this move.\n\nNow, food at (2,5) is still there.\n\nI need to get to (2,5).\n\nLet's consider moving left first to (3,1).\n\nFrom (3,1), I can go U to (3,2), or L to (2,1), or R to (4,1) but (4,1) is now S1, occupied, so not possible. D to (3,0) but y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nSo from (3,1), possible moves: U to (3,2), L to (2,1)\n\n(2,1) should be free, not wall.\n\nThen from (3,1), if I go U to (3,2), then head at (3,2), and so on.\n\nBut I need to go up to reach y=5.\n\nSimilarly, if I go U from (4,1) to (4,2), then from (4,2), I can go U to (4,3) but occupied, or L to (3,2), or R to (5,2), or D to (4,1) occupied.\n\nSo possible: L to (3,2) or R to (5,2)\n\n(5,2) might be free.\n\nLet's list free cells around.\n\nI am considering the path to (2,5).\n\nOne way: from (4,1) go L to (3,1), then U to (3,2), then U to (3,3)? (3,3) free? Snake positions: (4,3), (5,3), etc, but not (3,3), so probably free.\n\nThen U to (3,4), then U to (3,5), but (3,5) is tail now, but after first move, (3,5) is free, as we saw.\n\nAfter turn 27 move, (3,5) is free.\n\nSo from (3,1) to (3,2) to (3,3) to (3,4) to (3,5) but (3,5) is where tail was, but it's free after turn 27.\n\nThen from (3,5) I can go L to (2,5) to eat food.\n\nBut when I go to (3,5), it might be free, but I need to see when.\n\nLet's timeline.\n\nTurn 27: start at (4,1), move to, say, (3,1) by going L.\n\nAfter move, new head (3,1), tail is at (4,5), and (3,5) is free.\n\nFood at (2,5), life span now 7 (after turn 27).\n\nTurn 28: from (3,1), I can move U to (3,2)\n\nNew head (3,2), body shifts, tail at (5,5) or something.\n\nOld tail was (4,5), after move, new tail is old S10, which was (5,5)? Let's not detail, as long as no collision.\n\n(3,2) should be free.\n\nThen turn 29: from (3,2) move U to (3,3)\n\n(3,3) free.\n\nTurn 30: from (3,3) move U to (3,4)\n\n(3,4) free? Snake has (4,4) but not (3,4), so yes.\n\nTurn 31: from (3,4) move U to (3,5)\n\nNow (3,5): at turn 31, is it free? After previous moves, the snake body has moved, so (3,5) should be free since it was vacated at turn 27 and not reoccupied yet.\n\nThen from (3,5), I can move L to (2,5) on turn 32 to eat food.\n\nBut on turn 32, move to (2,5), eat food.\n\nNow, when I eat, the snake grows, so tail doesn't move, new segment added.\n\nBut (2,5) is adjacent to (3,5), but not the same cell, so no tail reward danger.\n\nAlso, (2,5) should be free to move to.\n\nNow, is this path safe?\n\nI need to check for collisions at each step.\n\nFirst, turn 27: move L to (3,1) - no wall, not occupied, good.\n\nAfter move, positions: head (3,1), then (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5) tail.\n\nTurn 28: move U to (3,2) - (3,2) free, no issue.\n\nNew positions: head (3,2), then (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5) tail.\n\n(4,5) is gone? S11 was (4,5), now tail is (5,5), since S11: old S10 = (5,5)\n\nIn turn 28 positions: after moving to (3,2), S0: (3,2), S1: old S0 = (3,1), S2: old S1 = (4,1), S3: old S2 = (5,1), S4: old S3 = (6,1), S5: old S4 = (6,2), S6: old S5 = (6,3), S7: old S6 = (5,3), S8: old S7 = (4,3), S9: old S8 = (4,4), S10: old S9 = (5,4), S11: old S10 = (5,5) // tail\n\nYes.\n\nTurn 29: move U to (3,3) - (3,3) free.\n\nNew head (3,3), S1: (3,2), S2: (3,1), S3: (4,1), S4: (5,1), S5: (6,1), S6: (6,2), S7: (6,3), S8: (5,3), S9: (4,3), S10: (4,4), S11: (5,4) tail.\n\n(5,5) is gone? S11 was (5,5), now tail at (5,4)\n\nTurn 30: move U to (3,4) - (3,4) free.\n\nNew head (3,4), S1: (3,3), S2: (3,2), S3: (3,1), S4: (4,1), S5: (5,1), S6: (6,1), S7: (6,2), S8: (6,3), S9: (5,3), S10: (4,3), S11: (4,4) tail.\n\nTurn 31: move U to (3,5) - (3,5) should be free. At this point, (3,5) was last occupied at turn 27, and since then, the snake has been moving, so it should be free. Also, no new food or anything, so yes, free.\n\nMove to (3,5), no problem.\n\nNew positions: head (3,5), S1: (3,4), S2: (3,3), S3: (3,2), S4: (3,1), S5: (4,1), S6: (5,1), S7: (6,1), S8: (6,2), S9: (6,3), S10: (5,3), S11: (4,3) tail.\n\nTurn 32: now move L to (2,5) to eat food.\n\n(2,5) has food, so move to (2,5), eat it, snake grows.\n\nSo after move, head at (2,5), and since eaten, tail does not advance, so the body is: S0: (2,5), then S1: old S0 = (3,5), but since growth, the tail stays, so segments: new head (2,5), then the previous body: (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), and tail remains (4,3)? No.\n\nStandard: when you eat, you add a new segment at head, so the length increases by one, and tail position stays the same for that turn.\n\nSo positions after eating: head moves to (2,5), then the body segments shift, but since eating, the tail is not removed; instead, a new segment is added at the head position after move.\n\nSequence: head moves to new cell (2,5), which has food, so the snake grows. Therefore, the new head is at (2,5), and each body segment moves to the previous position, but since growing, the last segment (tail) is not removed, so the tail position from before move is kept as part of body.\n\nBefore move at turn 32: head at (3,5), body: (3,4), (3,3), ..., down to tail (4,3) as above.\n\nAfter moving head to (2,5):\n\n- New head: (2,5)\n\n- Then new S1: old head position (3,5)\n\n- New S2: old S1 position (3,4)\n\n- ...\n\n- New S12: old S11 position (4,3)  // since length increased, tail is now (4,3), but (4,3) was S11 before, now it's S12.\n\nOld positions before move: S0: (3,5), S1: (3,4), S2: (3,3), S3: (3,2), S4: (3,1), S5: (4,1), S6: (5,1), S7: (6,1), S8: (6,2), S9: (6,3), S10: (5,3), S11: (4,3)\n\nAfter move to (2,5) and eat:\n\nNew S0: (2,5)  // head\n\nNew S1: old S0 = (3,5)\n\nNew S2: old S1 = (3,4)\n\nNew S3: old S2 = (3,3)\n\nNew S4: old S3 = (3,2)\n\nNew S5: old S4 = (3,1)\n\nNew S6: old S5 = (4,1)\n\nNew S7: old S6 = (5,1)\n\nNew S8: old S7 = (6,1)\n\nNew S9: old S8 = (6,2)\n\nNew S10: old S9 = (6,3)\n\nNew S11: old S10 = (5,3)\n\nNew S12: old S11 = (4,3)  // tail\n\nSo tail is at (4,3), and head at (2,5), no collision.\n\nAnd I ate the food, score +1, length increased.\n\nNow, this was by turn 32, within life span.\n\nBut life span was 8 at turn 27, so at turn 32, how many turns passed?\n\nTurn 27: life=8\n\nAfter turn 27: life=7\n\nTurn 28: life=6\n\n...\n\nTurn 32: when moving, life span decreases at start of turn or after?\n\nThe rule: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn t, before action, the life span is current.\n\nThen after turn, it decreases.\n\nFor food: at turn 27, life span=8, so it is present.\n\nAfter turn 27, life span decreases to 7, so at turn 28, life span=7.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 32, life span = 8 - (32-27) = ? From turn 27 to 32, 5 turns passed? Turns: turn 27 to turn 32 is 5 steps? Let's see:\n\n- Start of turn 27: life=8\n\n- After turn 27: life=7\n\n- Start of turn 28: life=7\n\n- After turn 28: life=6\n\n- ...\n\n- Start of turn 32: life=8 - (32-27) but 32-27=5, so life=8-5=3? Since decreases each turn including current.\n\nAt start of turn t, life span is L.\n\nAfter the turn, it decreases by 1.\n\nSo for turn 27: start, life=8, after turn, life=7\n\nTurn 28: start, life=7, after turn, life=6\n\n...\n\nTurn 32: start, life=8 - (32-27) = 8-5=3, so life=3, present.\n\nAfter turn 32, life=2, still present for next.\n\nI eat on turn 32, so fine.\n\nIn my plan, I eat on turn 32.\n\nBut I could eat earlier.\n\nIn this path, I used 5 moves to reach: from turn 27 to 32.\n\nTurn 27: move to (3,1)\n\nTurn 28: to (3,2)\n\nTurn 29: to (3,3)\n\nTurn 30: to (3,4)\n\nTurn 31: to (3,5)\n\nTurn 32: to (2,5) eat.\n\nSo 6 moves to eat, starting from turn 27 action.\n\nPosition at turn 27 after move: (3,1)\n\nThen turn 28: (3,2)\n\nTurn 29: (3,3)\n\nTurn 30: (3,4)\n\nTurn 31: (3,5)\n\nTurn 32: (2,5) eat.\n\nYes, 5 moves after turn 27 move, but turn 27 move is the first action.\n\nNow, what about the other option? Going up first.\n\nIf I go U from (4,1) to (4,2) on turn 27.\n\nThen after move, head at (4,2), tail at (4,5)? Positions: new head (4,2), S1: (4,1), S2: (5,1), ..., S11: (4,5) tail.\n\n(3,5) free.\n\nNow, from (4,2), I can go L to (3,2) or R to (5,2) or U to (4,3) occupied, invalid.\n\n(3,2) free, (5,2) free.\n\nTo go to (2,5), better to go left, so go to (3,2).\n\nTurn 28: move to (3,2)\n\nThen from there, similar to before: to (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), then (2,5).\n\nBut from (3,2) on turn 28, to (3,3) turn 29, (3,4) turn 30, (3,5) turn 31, (2,5) turn 32, same as before.\n\nBut in this case, I started at (4,2) after turn 27.\n\nCompared to first path, where after turn 27 I was at (3,1), then to (3,2) on turn 28, etc.\n\nIn first path: turn 27: to (3,1), turn 28: to (3,2), turn 29: to (3,3), etc.\n\nIn second: turn 27: to (4,2), turn 28: to (3,2), turn 29: to (3,3), etc.\n\nSo in second path, on turn 28 I reach (3,2), whereas in first, I reach (3,2) on turn 28 as well? First path: turn 27 to (3,1), turn 28 to (3,2) — same as second path turn 28 to (3,2).\n\nIn second path, from turn 27 (4,2) to turn 28 (3,2), then same as first path from (3,2) onwards.\n\nBut in first path, I was at (3,1) on turn 27, which is closer to left, but for going up, it doesn't matter.\n\nIn both cases, I can reach (3,5) by turn 31 and eat on turn 32.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nFor example, from (4,1), if I go U to (4,2), then on turn 28, instead of going left, I could go up, but (4,3) is occupied, so I have to go left or right.\n\nGo to (5,2)? But (5,2) is free, but then I'm going right, away from (2,5).\n\nNot good.\n\nSo going left is better.\n\nFrom (3,1) after turn 27, I could go directly to (2,1) on turn 28, then to (2,2), etc, but that might take longer to go up.\n\n(2,1) to (2,2) to (2,3) etc, but (2,3), (2,4) might be free.\n\nBut to reach y=5, I need to go up 4 cells from y=1, same as before.\n\nFrom (3,1) to (2,1) on turn 28, then (2,2) turn 29, (2,3) turn 30, (2,4) turn 31, (2,5) turn 32? (2,5) is food, so on turn 31 to (2,4), then turn 32 to (2,5) eat.\n\nTurn 27: to (3,1)\n\nTurn 28: to (2,1)  // L from (3,1)\n\nTurn 29: to (2,2)  // U, since from (2,1) to (2,2)\n\nTurn 30: to (2,3)  // U\n\nTurn 31: to (2,4)  // U\n\nTurn 32: to (2,5) eat // U? (2,4) to (2,5) is U, yes.\n\nBut (2,4) to (2,5) is up, y increases.\n\nNow, check if cells are free.\n\n(2,1): after turn 28 move, should be free.\n\n(2,2): free\n\n(2,3): free? Snake has no (2,3), yes.\n\n(2,4): free, no.\n\nThen (2,5) food.\n\nBut on turn 32, I eat.\n\nSame number of moves.\n\nBut in this path, I go to (2,1) then up, whereas in first path I went up to (3,5) then left.\n\nBut both take same time.\n\nNow, but in the first path, when I go to (3,5) on turn 31, (3,5) might be adjacent to something, but in the simulation, it was free.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (5,6), which is not on the path, so no issue.\n\nBut I need to think about after eating, or other risks.\n\nIn both cases, I can eat by turn 32.\n\nBut is there a risk in going left first?\n\nAt (3,1), it might be close to left wall, but x=0 is wall, (3,1) is x=3, fine.\n\nSimilarly, going up to (4,2) is also fine.\n\nBut I need to choose for turn 27.\n\nThe problem is to output actions for multiple turns, but the answer format is to list actions for turns starting from t1=27.\n\nIt says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions for the coming turns.\n\nThe answer format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ... }\n\nBut it doesn't specify how many turns to output. Probably, since I need to think ahead, I should output a sequence, but perhaps until I eat or something.\n\nBut to be safe, I should output a few turns.\n\nSince I have a plan to eat on turn 32, I can output from turn 27 to 32.\n\nBut turn 32 action is to eat, but I need to specify the moves.\n\nIn the first plan, with going left first.\n\nBut let's confirm the direction.\n\nCurrent head direction is L, so moving left to (3,1) is continuing left, which is fine.\n\nMoving up to (4,2) is changing direction, but allowed, since not reverse.\n\nNo reverse issue.\n\nNow, another consideration: after eating, the snake is longer, and I need to survive.\n\nBut no immediate danger.\n\nIn the path via (3,1), on turn 28, when I move to (2,1), from (3,1) to (2,1), that is left, but current direction after turn 27 is L, since I moved left to (3,1), so direction now L.\n\nThen moving left to (2,1) is same direction, fine.\n\nIf I go up, it would be changing.\n\nBut no problem.\n\nI think both paths are viable.\n\nBut perhaps I should avoid the tail area, but in this case, the tail is moving away.\n\nIn the initial state, tail is at (3,5), and I'm moving to (3,1), so not close.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (2,5) is only one, and I might need to plan beyond.\n\nBut since only one food, after eating, I can explore or wait for new food.\n\nBut the state doesn't say about new food spawning, so I think for now, I should eat this food.\n\nPerhaps there is negative food, but not mentioned, so only this positive food.\n\nThe food list has only one entry.\n\nSo I think eating it is good.\n\nNow, for turn 27, I can choose to go left or up.\n\nBut going left to (3,1) gets me closer to the food in x-direction.\n\nGoing up to (4,2) keeps me at x=4.\n\nBut since I need to go to x=2, going left is better.\n\nIn terms of moves, from (4,1) to (3,1) is decreasing x, closer to (2,5).\n\nFrom (4,1) to (4,2) is same x, not closer.\n\nSo going left is more direct.\n\nThen from (3,1), I can go up or left, but to (2,1) or (3,2).\n\nIf I go to (2,1) first, then up, or (3,2) then up.\n\nBut (2,1) is closer to (2,5) in x, but same y.\n\nNo big difference.\n\nBut in (2,1), I might be near left wall, but x=2, not 0 or 1, so fine.\n\nx=0 is wall, so (2,y) is safe.\n\nSimilarly, (1,y) is safe, but not necessary.\n\nIn my first path, I went to (3,2) etc.\n\nBut let's stick with the plan.\n\nSince I need to output actions, I should decide.\n\nAnother thing: the head direction.\n\nWhen I move, I need to set the direction for next no reverse.\n\nFor example, on turn 27, if I move L to (3,1), then direction is L, so on turn 28, I cannot move R.\n\nSimilarly, if I move U, direction U.\n\nIn the path to (3,5) then to (2,5), when I move to (2,5) from (3,5), I move left, which is fine.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, when I am at (3,5) on turn 31, and move to (2,5) on turn 32, that is left, so direction L.\n\nBut before that, when moving up to (3,5), from (3,4) to (3,5) is up, so direction U.\n\nThen from (3,5) to (2,5) is left, which is not reverse of U? Reverse of U is D, left is perpendicular, so allowed.\n\nNo problem.\n\nSimilarly, in the beginning.\n\nNow, but I need to think about after eating, but since no other food, I can just move safely.\n\nBut for now, let's output the actions.\n\nPerhaps I should output from turn 27 to say turn 32 or so.\n\nBut the answer might expect only the next action, but the format shows multiple turns.\n\nIt says \"action on turn t1, action on turn t1+1, ...\" so I think I need to provide a sequence.\n\nSince I have a plan, I can provide up to eating.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nAnother consideration: in the state, there is an internal obstacle at (5,6), which is not relevant for this path.\n\nAlso, walls.\n\nBut in this path, all moves are safe.\n\nBut let's confirm the cells.\n\nIn turn 31, moving to (3,5), is it free?\n\nAt that time, based on earlier simulation, yes.\n\nTo be thorough, let's list positions after each turn up to turn 31.\n\nBut I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I can eat earlier.\n\nFor example, if I can go directly, but from (4,1), I can't.\n\nSuppose on turn 27, I go U to (4,2)\n\nThen turn 28, go L to (3,2)\n\nThen turn 29, go U to (3,3) — but from (3,2) to (3,3) is U.\n\nThen turn 30, U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 31, U to (3,5)\n\nTurn 32, L to (2,5) same as before.\n\nIf from (3,2) I go to (2,2) on turn 29? But (2,2) might be free.\n\nTurn 28: from (3,2) I can go L to (2,2) instead of U.\n\nThen from (2,2), go U to (2,3) turn 30, U to (2,4) turn 31, U to (2,5) turn 32, same.\n\nBut (2,3), (2,4) should be free.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nSo six moves including turn 27.\n\nBut turn 27 action is first.\n\nNow, for turn 27, I think going left is better to start.\n\nBut let's see the other move: if I go up to (4,2), then I have option to go right to (5,2), but that might lead to dead end or something.\n\nFor example, (5,2) to (5,3) but (5,3) is occupied? At turn 27 after move to (4,2), positions: head (4,2), S1: (4,1), S2: (5,1), ..., S11: (4,5) tail.\n\n(5,3) is occupied by, in positions, S6: (5,3)? After turn 27: S0:(4,2), S1:(4,1), S2:(5,1), S3:(6,1), S4:(6,2), S5:(6,3), S6:(5,3), S7:(4,3), S8:(4,4), S9:(5,4), S10:(5,5), S11:(4,5)\n\nSo (5,3) is S6, occupied.\n\n(5,2) is free? Not in positions, so free.\n\nFrom (4,2), if I go R to (5,2) on turn 28.\n\nThen from (5,2), I can go U to (5,3) but occupied, or R to (6,2) occupied, or D to (5,1) occupied, or L to (4,2) occupied.\n\nAll adjacent cells: U (5,3) occupied, D (5,1) occupied, L (4,2) occupied, R (6,2) occupied.\n\n(6,2) is S4, occupied.\n\nSo from (5,2), no possible moves! Dead end.\n\nIf I go to (5,2) on turn 28, I would be stuck and die on next turn.\n\nTherefore, I must not go to (5,2); I must go left to (3,2) from (4,2).\n\nSimilarly, from (3,1), if I go to (3,2), fine, or to (2,1).\n\nBut going to (5,2) is dangerous.\n\nSo in the up-first option, if I go U on turn 27, then I must go L on turn 28 to avoid danger.\n\nBut in left-first, I go directly to (3,1), then I can choose.\n\nBut to be consistent, I think the left-first path is safer and direct.\n\nMoreover, in left-first, I am at (3,1) which is closer to food.\n\nNow, for the sequence.\n\nTurn 27: move L to (3,1)\n\nThen turn 28: I can move U to (3,2) or L to (2,1)\n\nIn my first plan, I moved U to (3,2), but I could move L to (2,1) for potentially same.\n\nBut let's assume I go U to (3,2) as per first plan.\n\nThen turn 29: U to (3,3)\n\nTurn 30: U to (3,4)\n\nTurn 31: U to (3,5)\n\nTurn 32: L to (2,5) eat\n\nNow, after eating, I need to move on, but the food is eaten, so no immediate goal.\n\nI can continue moving, but since no food, I should avoid walls and body.\n\nFor example, at turn 32, after eating, head at (2,5), body: (3,5), (3,4), etc as before.\n\nNow, from (2,5), I can move U to (2,6), D to (2,4), L to (1,5), or R to (3,5) but (3,5) is body, occupied.\n\nSo possible: U, D, L.\n\n(2,6): y=6, not wall, free? Not occupied.\n\n(2,4): free, (1,5) free.\n\nBut I don't need to specify beyond, but for the sequence, since the answer might expect multiple turns, I can output up to turn 32 or so.\n\nBut turn 32 is when I eat, so I can include that.\n\nTo think 5 turns ahead, from turn 27 to 31 or 32.\n\nTurn 27 to 32 is 6 turns.\n\nPerhaps output until the eat turn.\n\nBut I think for turn 27, action is L.\n\nBut let's confirm the direction no reverse.\n\nCurrent head direction is L, so moving L is allowed.\n\nMoving U is also allowed.\n\nBut moving L is consistent.\n\nNow, in the state, snake head direction is given as L, meaning it was moving left to reach (4,1), so for next move, I can move U, D, L, not R.\n\nL is fine.\n\nSo I think go L on turn 27.\n\nThen for subsequent turns.\n\nBut in the answer, I need to list actions.\n\nPerhaps I should output:\n\nTurn 27: L\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: L\n\nBut on turn 31, I move to (3,5), which is U from (3,4), and on turn 32, L to (2,5).\n\nBut after turn 32, I can stop or continue.\n\nSince the food is eaten, and no other food, I can just move safely, but not specified.\n\nTo be complete, I can output until turn 32.\n\nBut turn 32 action is included.\n\nNow, but in turn 31, when I move to (3,5), is it safe? Yes.\n\nAnother thing: the life span is 8, I eat on turn 32, which is fine.\n\nIf I go faster, but I don't think so.\n\nFrom (3,1) on turn 27, if I go directly to (2,1) on turn 28, then to (2,2) on turn 29, etc, same.\n\nBut going to (3,2) might be better to avoid the left edge, but not necessary.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo I'll go with the sequence.\n\nBut in the answer format, I need to box it.\n\nAlso, for turn 27, action is L.\n\nBut let's make sure about the grid.\n\nInternal obstacle (5,6), not on path.\n\nWalls, all borders.\n\nNow, another point: in the initial state, when I move, the tail moves, freeing (3,5), which is good for later.\n\nIn my plan, I use that.\n\nIf I had gone up, same thing.\n\nSo I think it's good.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating the positive food at (2,5) while ensuring long-term survival, a sequence of moves is planned 5+ turns ahead. The food has a life span of 8 at turn 27, decreasing to 1 by turn 33, so it must be eaten by turn 33. The snake starts at (4,1) with direction L (left). The path to (2,5) requires moving left and up, avoiding the snake body and walls. Moving left on turn 27 is prioritized to decrease the x-distance to the food efficiently. The chosen path is: (4,1) → (3,1) → (3,2) → (3,3) → (3,4) → (3,5) → (2,5), reaching the food on turn 32. This path is safe, with no collisions or dead ends, and eats the food within the life span. After eating, the snake grows by one segment. The moves consider the no-instant-reverse rule and prioritize survival by avoiding risky cells like (5,2), which could lead to a dead end.\n\n- **Turn 27**: Move L to (3,1) – Decreases x-distance to food, allowed since current direction is L (not reverse).  \n- **Turn 28**: Move U to (3,2) – Continues upward, freeing space and avoiding the body.  \n- **Turn 29**: Move U to (3,3) – Safe upward move toward y=5.  \n- **Turn 30**: Move U to (3,4) – Positions for the final approach to (3,5).  \n- **Turn 31**: Move U to (3,5) – (3,5) is free (vacated since turn 27), preparing to eat.  \n- **Turn 32**: Move L to (2,5) – Eats the food (life span 3 at turn 32 start), no tail reward danger (food not on tail cell), and snake grows.\n\nThis sequence eats the food on turn 32, within the life span, and ensures survival. After turn 32, the snake can move safely (e.g., U, D, or L from (2,5)), but no further actions are specified as the primary goal is achieved.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 27: \\text{L} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 28: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 29: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 30: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 31: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 32: \\text{L}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 28, and I'm playing Snake on an 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7), and (0,0) is probably the bottom-left or top-left? I should assume (0,0) is bottom-left or top-left? In grid terms, it's common to have (0,0) as top-left, but in this context, since y increases upwards? Let's see the movement: U is (x,y+1), which might imply y increases upwards, but typically in coordinates, y increases downwards. I need to clarify.\n\nThe movement definitions: U (x,y+1), D (x,y-1), L (x-1,y), R (x+1,y). If U is (x,y+1), that suggests that y increases as you go up, so (0,0) might be bottom-left. For example, moving up from (x,y) to (x,y+1) means higher y is up. Similarly, D to (x,y-1) means lower y is down. So yes, (0,0) is bottom-left, (7,7) is top-right. Walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so borders are included and cannot be moved to.\n\nAlso, there's an internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nSnake positions: head is at (3,1), and it's moving left, since head direction is L. So the snake is: [(3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)]\n\nLet me list these positions to visualize:\n\n- Head: (3,1)\n\n- Then (4,1)\n\n- (5,1)\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (6,2)\n\n- (6,3)\n\n- (5,3)\n\n- (4,3)\n\n- (4,4)\n\n- (5,4)\n\n- (5,5)\n\n- (4,5) — this is the tail, I assume, since it's the last one.\n\nThe snake has 12 segments.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (2,5) with life span 7, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (6,4) with life span 10, value 1 (positive)\n\nBoth are positive food, no negative food here.\n\nLife span: for (2,5), life span 7, meaning it disappears after 7 turns, including the current turn? The rule says: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\", so at turn 28, life span 7, so it will disappear after turn 28 + 7 - 1? Let's see.\n\n\"Disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn including current\". So if at turn t, life span is L, it will disappear after turn t + L - 1? For example, if L=1, it disappears at the end of this turn, so it can be eaten this turn but not next. If L=2, it can be eaten this turn or next, and disappears after turn t+1.\n\nStandard: at turn t, with life span L, the food is present for turns t to t + L - 1 inclusive. So it disappears at turn t + L.\n\nRule: \"disappears after N turns\", meaning after N turns from now, it's gone. So if N=7 at turn 28, it disappears after 7 turns, so at turn 35 it's gone. It can be eaten from turn 28 to 34 inclusive.\n\nSimilarly, for (6,4), life span 10, so disappears after turn 28 + 10 = 38, so can be eaten from turn 28 to 37.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns, to maximize score while avoiding risks.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid to understand positions.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders, so cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- (3,1) head\n\n- (4,1)\n\n- (5,1)\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (6,2)\n\n- (6,3)\n\n- (5,3)\n\n- (4,3)\n\n- (4,4)\n\n- (5,4)\n\n- (5,5)\n\n- (4,5) tail\n\nCurrent head direction is L, so moving left, from (4,1) to (3,1)? Snake positions are head first: [(3,1), (4,1), ...] so at turn 28, head is at (3,1), and it just moved there from (4,1) by going left. So previous position was (4,1), now at (3,1) facing left.\n\nNow, possible moves: since head direction is L, I can move L (continue left), U (up), D (down), but not R, because R is opposite to L, and no instant reverse.\n\nRule: \"No instant reverse\": Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nSo current direction is L, so cannot move R on this turn.\n\nAvailable moves: L (left to (2,1)), U (up to (3,2)), D (down to (3,0)) but (3,0) is y=0, which is wall, so D is invalid.\n\nD to (3,0), y=0 is wall, so cannot move there.\n\nL to (2,1): what is (2,1)? Is it occupied? Snake positions: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), etc. (2,1) is not in the list, and not wall, so should be free.\n\nU to (3,2): not in snake positions, not wall, so free.\n\nNow, food at (2,5) and (6,4).\n\n(2,5) is at x=2,y=5.\n\n(6,4) is at x=6,y=4.\n\nCurrent head at (3,1).\n\nI need to think about paths to food while avoiding collisions and considering future moves.\n\nAlso, \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nTail is at (4,5), and it has food? No, food is at (2,5) and (6,4), not on tail. Tail is at (4,5), no food there. So no issue for now.\n\nFirst, let's find possible moves from (3,1):\n\n- L to (2,1)\n\n- U to (3,2)\n\nD to (3,0) is wall, invalid.\n\nR is opposite, not allowed.\n\nSo only L or U.\n\nNow, I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nGoal: maximize score, so eat positive food, but prioritize survival.\n\nFood at (2,5) is closer in x, but y is higher; head at y=1, food at y=5.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) is at x=6,y=4.\n\nFrom (3,1), to reach (2,5), I need to go up and left.\n\nTo reach (6,4), I need to go right and up, but current direction is L, so moving R might not be immediate.\n\nBut R is not possible this turn anyway.\n\nAlso, internal obstacle at (5,6), which is above, might affect paths.\n\nFirst, let's list all occupied cells to avoid.\n\nSnake body: all positions except the head? No, for collision, head cannot touch body except the tail under certain conditions.\n\nCollision rule: head touches any body segment except that it can move to the tail cell because tail will move.\n\nSpecifically: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, when moving, if head moves to a cell that is occupied by a body segment except the tail, it collides. If it moves to the tail cell, it's ok, because after move, tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (4,5), so if head moves to (4,5), it might be ok if tail moves.\n\nBut in this position, (4,5) is not adjacent to head; head is at (3,1), tail at (4,5), not adjacent.\n\nNow, for current turn, from (3,1), moving to:\n\n- (2,1): not occupied, not wall.\n\n- (3,2): not occupied, not wall.\n\nBoth safe for now.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, food at (6,4): (6,4) is currently occupied? Snake positions: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), etc. (6,4) is not listed, but food is at (6,4), so it must be free? Food positions are given separately, so (6,4) has food, meaning it's not occupied by snake or wall, I assume.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) has food.\n\nBut (6,4) might be under snake body? Rule says food can spawn under body, but can only be eaten if body moves away and head moves on.\n\nLet's check if (6,4) is occupied by snake.\n\nSnake positions: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5)\n\n(6,4) is not in this list, so it's free, and food is there.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) not in list, free.\n\nBut (5,4) is part of snake, but food is at (6,4), different cell.\n\n(5,4) is snake, (6,4) is food.\n\nNow, for (6,4), it might be that the snake body is near it.\n\nSpecifically, (6,3) is snake, (6,4) is adjacent above it.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) is snake to the left, but (5,4) is at (5,4), (6,4) is right of it.\n\n(5,4) is snake, which is left and down from (6,4)? (6,4) is x=6,y=4, (5,4) is x=5,y=4, so adjacent left.\n\n(6,3) is below at (6,3).\n\nSo (6,4) has snake at (6,3) below and (5,4) left, but not occupied, so head can move there if possible.\n\nBut to eat it, head needs to move to (6,4).\n\nSimilarly for (2,5).\n\nNow, life span: (2,5) has life 7, so must be eaten by turn 34 (since turn 28 + 6 = 34, disappears after 7 turns, so last chance turn 34).\n\nTurn t=28, life span 7, disappears after N turns, N=7, so disappears at turn 28+7=35, so can be eaten up to turn 34.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) life 10, disappears at turn 38, can be eaten up to turn 37.\n\nPlenty of time.\n\nBut I need to plan path.\n\nAlso, the snake is long, 12 segments, so when it eats food, it grows by one, so length increases.\n\nPositive food, length +1.\n\nNow, from current position (3,1), I can go L to (2,1) or U to (3,2).\n\nIf I go L to (2,1), then from there, I can go L, U, D, but D to (2,0) is y=0 wall, invalid, so L to (1,1) or U to (2,2) or possibly R to (3,1) but (3,1) was head, now it's body? After move, head moves to (2,1), so body segments shift.\n\nAfter moving to (2,1), snake becomes: head (2,1), then (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (4,5) — tail is still (4,5), but when head moves, tail stays? No, when snake moves, all segments shift, so the tail moves away from current position.\n\nStandard snake: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the last segment (tail) is removed from its position, and new head position added.\n\nBut if no food eaten, tail moves away, so the cell it was on becomes free.\n\nIf food eaten, tail doesn't move, so snake grows.\n\nIn this case, since we're moving and not eating yet, tail will move.\n\nFrom turn 28, head at (3,1), moving to say (2,1), then new head (2,1), body: (3,1), (4,1), ..., up to (4,5), but the segment that was at (4,5) will be removed, so tail moves to the previous position of the second last, which is (5,5)? Let's see the list.\n\nCurrent positions: index 0: (3,1) head, 1: (4,1), 2: (5,1), 3: (6,1), 4: (6,2), 5: (6,3), 6: (5,3), 7: (4,3), 8: (4,4), 9: (5,4), 10: (5,5), 11: (4,5) tail.\n\nAfter moving head to new position, the new head is at new cell, and each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous one, so segment 1 moves to where head was (3,1), segment 2 to where segment 1 was (4,1), and so on, up to segment 11 (tail) moves to where segment 10 was (5,5), and the old tail position (4,5) is vacated.\n\nSo new snake: head at (2,1) if moved left, then body: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5) — and tail at (5,5), since segment 11 moves to (5,5), and (4,5) is free.\n\nSimilarly, if move up to (3,2), new head (3,2), body (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5) — tail at (5,5).\n\nNow, back to choices.\n\nI need to get to food.\n\nFirst, food at (2,5): from (3,1), I can go up to (3,2), then to (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), then left to (2,5). Or from (3,1) left to (2,1), then up to (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5).\n\nSimilarly, food at (6,4): from (3,1), I need to go right and up. But currently at (3,1), to go to (6,4), I can go up first to (3,2), then right to (4,2), but (4,2) is free? Current positions: (4,1) is snake, (4,2) not occupied, I think.\n\nList free cells.\n\nGrid: x 0-7, y 0-7, walls at borders and (5,6).\n\nCells occupied by snake: the positions listed.\n\nOthers are free, except walls.\n\n(2,1) free, (3,2) free, etc.\n\nTo reach (6,4), from (3,1), one path: U to (3,2), then R to (4,2), then R to (5,2), but (5,2) is free? (5,1) is snake, (5,2) not listed, should be free. Then from (5,2) to (6,2), but (6,2) is snake? Current: (6,2) is position, occupied. After moves, it changes.\n\nI need to simulate multiple turns.\n\nAlso, the internal obstacle at (5,6) might block some paths.\n\n(5,6) is wall, so cannot go there.\n\nNow, (6,4) is food, and it's at (6,4), which is above (6,3) which is snake.\n\nBut (6,3) is body, so if I move to (6,4), I can eat, but I need to approach it.\n\nFirst, let's consider the two options for turn 28.\n\nOption 1: Move L to (2,1)\n\nThen snake: head (2,1), body (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5) tail at (5,5)\n\nNow, from (2,1), head direction now L (since moved left), so can move L, U, D. D to (2,0) wall, invalid. So L to (1,1) or U to (2,2).\n\n(1,1) is free, not wall, not occupied. (2,2) free.\n\nIf I go U to (2,2), then I'm going towards (2,5).\n\nFrom (2,2), I can go U to (2,3), U to (2,4), U to (2,5) to eat food at (2,5).\n\n(2,5) is food, so when I move to (2,5), I eat it, snake grows.\n\nSimilarly, from (2,1), if I go L to (1,1), then I might go up later, but (2,5) is at y=5, x=2, so going to (1,1) is away, might not be efficient.\n\nSo probably from (2,1), better to go U to (2,2) to approach food.\n\nBut let's see the other option.\n\nOption 2: Move U to (3,2) at turn 28.\n\nThen snake: head (3,2), body (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5) tail at (5,5)\n\nFrom (3,2), head direction U (since moved up), so can move U, L, R. Not D (down).\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,3), L to (2,2), R to (4,2).\n\nAll should be free.\n\n(3,3) free, (2,2) free, (4,2) free.\n\nIf I go U to (3,3), then to (3,4), (3,5), then I can go to (2,5) or (4,5), but (4,5) is not food, food at (2,5).\n\n(3,5) to (2,5) left.\n\nFrom (3,2) if I go L to (2,2), similar as before.\n\nOr R to (4,2), then I can go towards (6,4).\n\n(6,4) is at (6,4), from (4,2), I can go R to (5,2), then to (6,2), but (6,2) might be occupied later.\n\nLet's think about the food at (6,4).\n\n(6,4) is food, and it's near the snake's body.\n\nCurrent snake has segments at (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), etc.\n\nIf I want to eat (6,4), I need to move the head there.\n\nBut from current position (3,1), it's a bit far.\n\nI could go up to (3,2), then right to (4,2), (5,2), then to (6,2).\n\nAt (6,2), what is around? (6,2) is currently part of snake, but after moves, it might be free or not.\n\nLet's simulate a path to (6,4).\n\nSuppose at turn 28, I move U to (3,2).\n\nThen turn 29, from (3,2), I move R to (4,2). Head direction U, so moving R is allowed, not opposite.\n\nThen snake: head (4,2), body (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4) tail at (5,4)? Let's list: after move to (4,2), body: (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4) — and tail is (5,4) or (4,4)? Positions: index 0: (4,2), 1: (3,2), 2: (3,1), 3: (4,1), 4: (5,1), 5: (6,1), 6: (6,2), 7: (6,3), 8: (5,3), 9: (4,3), 10: (4,4), 11: (5,4) — tail (5,4).\n\n(5,5) was tail, but it moved to where segment 10 was, (5,4) in previous, but in this new list, segment 11 is at (5,4), which was food? No, food is at (6,4), not (5,4).\n\n(5,4) is snake body.\n\nFrom (4,2), I can move to (5,2)? (5,2) is free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\nMove R to (5,2), head direction now R (since moved right from (4,2) to (5,2)).\n\nThen snake: head (5,2), body (4,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) tail at (4,4)? List: after move to (5,2), body: (4,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) — and tail at (4,4), since segment 11 moves to where 10 was, (4,4).\n\n(5,4) is still there? Segment 10 was (4,4) in previous, but now it's shifted.\n\nPrevious head (4,2), body (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)\n\nAfter moving to (5,2), new head (5,2), body: (4,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) — tail at (4,4). (5,4) is gone, vacated.\n\nNow, from (5,2), I can move to (6,2), since (6,2) is free? (6,2) was occupied, but in this new snake, (6,2) is still body? In the list, position 6 is (6,2), which is body, so (6,2) is occupied by body segment.\n\nAt turn after moving to (5,2), positions: (5,2) head, (4,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) tail.\n\nSo (6,2) is occupied, so I cannot move to (6,2) because it's body.\n\nFrom (5,2), possible moves: U to (5,3), D to (5,1), L to (4,2), R to (6,2) but (6,2) occupied, invalid.\n\nHead direction is R, so can move U, D, R, but R to (6,2) occupied, so only U or D or L.\n\nL to (4,2) is body? (4,2) is body segment, position 1, so occupied, cannot move there.\n\nU to (5,3): (5,3) is in the list, position 9: (5,3), occupied, invalid.\n\nD to (5,1): (5,1) is position 5, occupied, invalid.\n\nOh no! From (5,2), all directions are invalid?\n\nU to (5,3): (5,3) is body, occupied.\n\nD to (5,1): (5,1) body, occupied.\n\nL to (4,2): (4,2) body, occupied.\n\nR to (6,2): (6,2) body, occupied.\n\nSo (5,2) is surrounded by body on all sides? But (5,2) itself is free, but adjacent cells all occupied.\n\n(5,2) north: (5,3) occupied\n\nSouth: (5,1) occupied\n\nWest: (4,2) occupied\n\nEast: (6,2) occupied\n\nYes, all adjacent cells are occupied by body, so from (5,2), no possible move, death!\n\nBut in this path, I moved to (5,2) at some point, but at that time, the cells were occupied.\n\nIn this simulation, after moving to (5,2), the snake body occupies all adjacent cells, so head cannot move anywhere, collision.\n\nBut that means moving to (5,2) is deadly.\n\nIn the sequence: from (3,1) move U to (3,2), then from (3,2) move R to (4,2), then from (4,2) move R to (5,2), but at that point, when at (4,2), moving to (5,2), (5,2) was free before, but after moving, the body positions make it surrounded.\n\nAt the time of move from (4,2) to (5,2), what is the state?\n\nAt turn start, head at (4,2), body: (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4) tail at (5,4)\n\nNow, moving to (5,2): (5,2) is not in this list, so it's free, no wall, so I can move there.\n\nBut after moving, the new body includes (4,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), and head at (5,2), so (5,2) is head, body at (4,2), which is adjacent, but when I move to (5,2), the cell (5,2) was free, so no collision on move.\n\nBut after the move, for the next turn, when I need to move from (5,2), the adjacent cells are:\n\n- North (5,3): occupied by body (in the list, (5,3) is there)\n\n- South (5,1): occupied\n\n- West (4,2): occupied\n\n- East (6,2): occupied\n\nAll are body segments, so I have no valid move, and since I must move, I collide and die.\n\nTherefore, moving to (5,2) in this way leads to death on the next turn.\n\nSo this path is dangerous.\n\nTherefore, I should avoid going to (5,2) when the body is like this.\n\nIn this case, for the first move at turn 28, moving U to (3,2) and then planning to go right might lead to a trap.\n\nBetter to go left first.\n\nNow, option: move L to (2,1) at turn 28.\n\nThen snake: head (2,1), body (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5) tail at (5,5)\n\nHead direction L.\n\nPossible moves: L to (1,1), U to (2,2), D to (2,0) invalid.\n\nSo L or U.\n\n(1,1) free, (2,2) free.\n\nNow, to reach food at (2,5), I can go U from here.\n\nMove U to (2,2) at turn 29.\n\nThen head at (2,2), direction U.\n\nBody: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4) tail at (5,4)? After move: head (2,2), body (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4) — tail (5,4)\n\n(5,5) moved to (5,4).\n\nFrom (2,2), move U to (2,3) at turn 30.\n\n(2,3) free? Assume yes.\n\nHead (2,3), body (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) tail at (4,4)\n\nThen move U to (2,4) at turn 31.\n\nHead (2,4), body (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) tail at (4,3)\n\n(4,4) moved to (4,3).\n\nThen move U to (2,5) at turn 32.\n\n(2,5) is food, so move to (2,5), eat food, snake grows, so tail does not move.\n\nNew head (2,5), body: (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) and the tail stays, so length increases by one, tail at (4,3).\n\nAfter eating, new positions: head at (2,5), then the body segments: since food eaten, tail doesn't move, so the body includes all previous segments plus the new head, but the segments are: previous head position was (2,4), so body: (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) — and tail is still (4,3), no, when head moves to new cell, and eats, the tail doesn't move, so the new snake has the new head and all previous body segments.\n\nPrevious before move: head at (2,4), body (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) tail (4,3)\n\nMove to (2,5), eat food, so new head (2,5), body: (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) — 12 body segments, tail at (4,3).\n\nLength was 12, now 13.\n\nNow, head at (2,5), direction U (since moved up).\n\nNow, from here, I can consider going to (6,4) or other.\n\nBut (6,4) is still there.\n\nLife span of (2,5) was 7 at turn 28, so at turn 32, it has been 4 turns, life span decreases each turn, so at turn 28:7, turn29:6, t30:5, t31:4, t32:3? Countdown decreases every turn.\n\nAt turn t, life span L, after each turn, L decreases by 1.\n\nAt turn 28, L=7 for (2,5)\n\nAfter turn 28, L=6 for turn 29\n\nAfter turn 29, L=5 for turn 30\n\nAfter turn 30, L=4 for turn 31\n\nAfter turn 31, L=3 for turn 32\n\nAt turn 32, when I move to (2,5), L=3, so I eat it.\n\nSimilarly, for (6,4), at turn 28 L=10, turn29:9, t30:8, t31:7, t32:6, etc.\n\nNow back to the choice.\n\nIf at turn 28 I move L to (2,1), then go up to (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) by turn 32, eat food.\n\nSafe path, no issues.\n\nIf at turn 28 I move U to (3,2), then from there, to reach (2,5), I can go to (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), then to (2,5).\n\nBut at (3,5), I can move L to (2,5).\n\nSimilarly, from (3,2), move U to (3,3) turn29, U to (3,4) turn30, U to (3,5) turn31, then L to (2,5) turn32.\n\nAlso possible.\n\nBut in this case, when I go to (3,5), (2,5) is adjacent, but no problem.\n\nBut earlier, if I go right, I might get trapped.\n\nMoreover, (6,4) is another food.\n\nBut (6,4) might be riskier because of the body around.\n\nFor example, to reach (6,4), from current, I need to go to the right side.\n\nBut after eating (2,5), I can go to (6,4).\n\nBut let's see if I can reach (6,4) directly or later.\n\nSince (2,5) has shorter life span? Both have long life, (2,5) disappears after 7 turns from 28, so by turn 34, (6,4) by turn 37.\n\nBut (2,5) is closer to current position.\n\nDistance: from (3,1) to (2,5) is |3-2| + |1-5| =1 +4=5 Manhattan, to (6,4) is |3-6| + |1-4|=3+3=6, so (2,5) slightly closer.\n\nBut with the body configuration, going left and up seems safer.\n\nMoreover, if I go U first to (3,2), and then if I go right, I might get stuck, as in the earlier simulation.\n\nTherefore, better to go left to (2,1) first.\n\nThen proceed up to eat (2,5).\n\nNow, after that, I can go for (6,4).\n\nBut I need to output multiple turns, at least 5 turns ahead.\n\nTurn 28: action\n\nTurn 29: action\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 32 or so.\n\nSince at turn 28, I need to choose action for turn 28, then predict actions for future turns.\n\nBut the actions depend on the state, so I need to plan a sequence.\n\nSince the grid might change, but no other snakes, only me, so I can plan.\n\nAlso, food life span decreases, but no new food mentioned, so only these two.\n\nIn this state, only two food items.\n\nSo for turn 28, move L to (2,1)\n\nThen turn 29, from (2,1), move U to (2,2) (since going up towards food)\n\nThen turn 30, from (2,2), move U to (2,3)\n\nTurn 31, from (2,3), move U to (2,4)\n\nTurn 32, from (2,4), move U to (2,5) to eat food.\n\nNow, at turn 32, head at (2,5), after eating.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions from turn 28 to at least turn 28+5=33, but since I have up to turn 32, and turn 33 is after.\n\nBut turn 33 action I can plan or not necessary, but since I need 5+ turns, from t28 to t33 is 6 turns, including t28.\n\n\"Think 5+ turns ahead\" and \"answer format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nSo for t1=28, I need actions for turn 28,29,30,31,32,... at least up to 32 or 33.\n\nIn my plan, up to turn 32 I have specific moves.\n\nFor turn 33, I can plan based on state.\n\nBut to output, I can include turn 33.\n\nAfter turn 32, head at (2,5), direction U.\n\nNow, possible moves: U to (2,6), but y=6, not wall, y=7 is wall, so (2,6) free? Not occupied, probably.\n\nL to (1,5), R to (3,5), D to (2,4) but (2,4) is body, occupied.\n\nAfter eating at turn 32, snake positions: head (2,5), body (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)\n\nTail at (4,3).\n\nNow, from (2,5), can move:\n\n- U to (2,6): should be free, not wall, not occupied.\n\n- L to (1,5): free, not wall.\n\n- R to (3,5): (3,5) not in list, free.\n\n- D to (2,4): occupied by body, invalid.\n\nHead direction U, so cannot move D (down) anyway, since opposite? No, current direction is U, so cannot move D only if it's opposite, but D is opposite to U, so cannot move down.\n\nRule: \"no instant reverse\", cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn.\n\nCurrent direction after moving to (2,5) is U, so next turn, cannot move D.\n\nSo possible moves: U to (2,6), L to (1,5), R to (3,5).\n\nAll should be valid.\n\nNow, I need to go to (6,4) eventually.\n\n(6,4) is at (6,4), which is near the tail area.\n\nCurrent tail at (4,3), but after moves, it will change.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can move R to (3,5), then to (4,5), etc.\n\nBut (4,5) might be occupied or not.\n\nSince I have time, I can go up or left first, but (6,4) is to the right and down a bit.\n\ny=4 vs y=5.\n\nSo moving right towards x=6.\n\nBut let's not specify too far.\n\nFor the answer, I can output the actions to get to the food.\n\nNow, another thing: the internal obstacle at (5,6), which might affect if I go up.\n\nBut for now, in the path to (2,5), it's fine.\n\nNow, back to turn 28.\n\nIf I move U to (3,2) first, it might be possible to go to (2,5) via (3,3),(3,4),(3,5), but it takes the same number of moves, and going left first seems safer to avoid the potential trap on the right.\n\nMoreover, with the body on the right, it might be congested.\n\nTherefore, better to go left and up to eat (2,5) quickly.\n\nThen for the sequence:\n\nTurn 28: L (to (2,1))\n\nTurn 29: U (to (2,2))\n\nTurn 30: U (to (2,3))\n\nTurn 31: U (to (2,4))\n\nTurn 32: U (to (2,5) eat food)\n\nNow, for turn 33, I need an action. Since I need to output multiple turns, I can plan one more.\n\nAt turn 32, head at (2,5), direction U.\n\nThen turn 33, I can move, say, R to (3,5) to start moving towards (6,4).\n\nSince (6,4) is at (6,4), from (3,5), I can go down to (3,4), then right, etc.\n\nBut I should think about the path.\n\nSince I have to output actions, and for survival, after eating, I need to find open space.\n\nBut for now, output the sequence.\n\nTo be complete, for turn 33, I can move R to (3,5).\n\nBut let's confirm if all moves are valid.\n\nFirst, turn 28: move L from (3,1) to (2,1). Valid, not wall, not occupied.\n\nAfter move: head (2,1), direction L.\n\nBody: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5) tail (5,5)\n\nTurn 29: move U to (2,2). Valid, (2,2) free.\n\nHead now (2,2), direction U (since moved up).\n\nBody: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4) tail (5,4)\n\n(5,5) moved to (5,4).\n\nTurn 30: move U to (2,3). (2,3) free.\n\nHead (2,3), direction U.\n\nBody: (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) tail (4,4)\n\nTurn 31: move U to (2,4). (2,4) free.\n\nHead (2,4), direction U.\n\nBody: (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) tail (4,3)\n\n(4,4) moved to (4,3).\n\nTurn 32: move U to (2,5). (2,5) has food, so eat it, snake grows.\n\nHead (2,5), direction U.\n\nBody: (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) tail (4,3) — length 13.\n\nNow turn 33: from (2,5), direction U, can move U, L, R (not D).\n\nU to (2,6): free? Not wall, not occupied, yes.\n\nL to (1,5): free.\n\nR to (3,5): free.\n\nI can move R to (3,5) to go towards the other food.\n\n(3,5) should be free.\n\nThen after that, I can go to (4,5), but (4,5) might be free or not.\n\nCurrently, positions: (4,3) is tail, (4,4) not occupied, etc.\n\nBut I don't need to specify beyond.\n\nFor the answer, since I need at least 5 actions, from turn 28 to 32 is 5 actions: t28,29,30,31,32.\n\nt28 to t32 is 5 turns: 28,29,30,31,32.\n\nt28: first action, t29: second, ..., up to t32: fifth action.\n\nAnd I have them.\n\nI can add turn 33 if needed, but 5+ turns, so 5 is minimum.\n\nIn the plan, I have a safe path to eat the food.\n\nIf I go U first at t28, I might still go to (2,5) but via different path, but it might take similar turns and risk going near the congested area.\n\nFor example, at t28 move U to (3,2), then t29 move U to (3,3), t30 U to (3,4), t31 U to (3,5), t32 L to (2,5) eat.\n\nAlso 5 turns to eat.\n\nBut at (3,2), if I accidentally go right, danger, but I can choose to go up.\n\nHowever, going left first keeps me away from the body cluster.\n\nMoreover, after eating, if I go to (3,5), I can go to (6,4) from there, but (6,4) is at y=4, so I need to go down.\n\nBut not necessary.\n\nI think the left path is fine.\n\nSo for the answer, actions:\n\nTurn 28: L\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nAnd for turn 33, I can say R or something, but not needed for now.\n\nIn the answer format, I need to output for multiple turns, but it doesn't specify how many, but at least 5 actions.\n\nSince after turn 32 I eat, and turn 33 is extra.\n\nBut in the box, I can put up to turn 32.\n\nTo be safe, I can include turn 33.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (6,4), and the tail danger, but not relevant now.\n\nAlso, at (6,4), since (6,3) is body, but when I approach, if the body moves away, it might be ok.\n\nBut for now, I think the plan is good.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 28: L (left)\n\nTurn 29: U (up)\n\nTurn 30: U (up)\n\nTurn 31: U (up)\n\nTurn 32: U (up) to eat food at (2,5)\n\nThen for turn 33, say, move R to (3,5)\n\nBut since not specified, I can stop at turn 32.\n\nIn the answer, I should output the sequence for the actions I take.\n\nPerhaps output 5 actions.\n\nBut the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but for output, it can be the actions for the next turns.\n\nI think outputting turns 28 to 32 is fine.\n\nTo be precise.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, the plan prioritizes eating the positive food at (2,5) due to its closer proximity to the current snake head position (3,1) and the congested body configuration on the right side of the grid, which poses a collision risk. The food at (2,5) has a remaining life span of 7 turns (disappears after turn 34), allowing time for a safe approach. The food at (6,4) has a longer life span (disappears after turn 38) and can be targeted after securing the first food item.\n\nThe chosen path moves the snake left to (2,1) and then directly upward to (2,5) over the next 4 turns, eating the food on turn 32. This avoids the high-risk area near (5,2) and (6,y) where the snake's body could trap the head. After eating, the snake grows to length 13, and the head is at (2,5) facing up. From there, moving right to (3,5) on turn 33 begins the approach toward the second food at (6,4), leveraging the open space.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Risk Avoidance**: Moving left first (turn 28) avoids the body cluster near (6,1)-(6,3) and (5,y). Attempting to move right immediately could lead to a trap, as seen in simulation where moving to (5,2) results in no valid moves and death.\n- **Food Priority**: (2,5) is eaten first due to shorter Manhattan distance (5 vs. 6 to (6,4)) and lower risk. Both foods are positive (+1 score, +1 length), so eating either is beneficial, but (2,5) is safer and faster to reach.\n- **Movement Constraints**: \n  - Turn 28: Head direction is left, so reverse move (right) is invalid. Down to (3,0) is a wall, leaving only left or up as options.\n  - Subsequent turns adhere to \"no instant reverse\" (e.g., after moving up, down is invalid).\n- **Collision Safety**: \n  - The path to (2,5) stays clear of walls, obstacles, and body segments.\n  - Tail reward danger is irrelevant as no food is on the tail.\n- **5+ Turn Plan**: The sequence covers 6 turns (turns 28–33), ensuring the first food is eaten and positioning for future moves. After turn 33, the snake can continue toward (6,4) via (4,5), (5,5), etc., monitoring body movements and food life spans.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 28**: Move left (L) to (2,1). *Rationale: Avoids body cluster; positions for upward path to food.*\n- **Turn 29**: Move up (U) to (2,2). *Rationale: Continues safe ascent toward (2,5); no immediate risks.*\n- **Turn 30**: Move up (U) to (2,3). *Rationale: Maintains upward momentum; all adjacent cells free.*\n- **Turn 31**: Move up (U) to (2,4). *Rationale: Prepares for food capture; cell (2,4) is free.*\n- **Turn 32**: Move up (U) to (2,5) to eat food (+1 score, snake length 13). *Rationale: Secures immediate reward; head now at (2,5) facing up.*\n- **Turn 33**: Move right (R) to (3,5). *Rationale: Starts approach to (6,4); avoids congestion and uses open space.*\n\nThis plan safely achieves one food capture by turn 32, with turn 33 initiating the next phase. After turn 33, the snake should head downward and right toward (6,4), adjusting for body movements and obstacles.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 28: L \\\\\nTurn 29: U \\\\\nTurn 30: U \\\\\nTurn 31: U \\\\\nTurn 32: U \\\\\nTurn 33: R\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 29. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (5,6). So the playable area is from (1,1) to (6,6), but with (5,6) blocked.\n\nSnake positions: head at (2,1), then (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5). That's 12 segments. Head direction is left, meaning it was moving left to (2,1) from (3,1) I assume, since positions are head first.\n\nHead direction is L, so current movement is left. But since it's at (2,1), and previous was (3,1), yes, moving left.\n\nFood: two items.\n\n- (2,5) with life span 6, value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (6,4) with life span 9, value 1 (positive food)\n\nBoth are positive food, no negative food here.\n\nLife span: for (2,5), it disappears after 6 turns, including current turn, so it will vanish after turn 29+6-1? Let's clarify life span.\n\nLife span N: disappears after N turns, and countdown decreases every turn including current. So for food at turn t, it will disappear at turn t + N - 1? Let's think.\n\nIf life span is N at turn t, after turn t, life span becomes N-1, and so on, until it reaches 0, then disappears. So it can be eaten only when life span >0.\n\nFor example, at turn t, life span N, it exists. After turn t, life span N-1, still exists until life span 1. After being at life span 1 for one turn, it disappears before the next turn? The rule says \"disappears after N turns\", and \"countdown decreases every turn (including current)\".\n\nI think it's better to interpret: at the start of turn t, food has life span L. If L >0, it can be eaten during turn t. After the turn, L decreases by 1. If L becomes 0 after decrease, it disappears.\n\nBut the rule says \"disappears after N turns\", meaning it exists for N turns starting from when it spawned.\n\nIn the input, it's given with life_span at current turn. So for (2,5), at turn 29, life_span=6, so it will exist for 6 more turns? Let's see.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn t, if life_span is N, it means after N turns, it will disappear. Countdown decreases each turn, so after turn t, countdown is N-1, after turn t+1, N-2, ..., after turn t + N -1, countdown=1, then after that turn, countdown=0 and it disappears. So it can be eaten from turn t to turn t + N -1.\n\nFor (2,5), life_span=6 at turn 29, so it can be eaten from turn 29 to 34 inclusive? Turn 29: L=6, after turn 29, L=5; turn 30: L=5, after decrease L=4; ... turn 34: L=1, after decrease L=0, disappears. So it exists during turns 29 to 34, and can be eaten in those turns.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) life_span=9 at turn 29, so exists until turn 37.\n\nBoth are positive food, value +1 each.\n\nNow, snake head at (2,1), direction L, so moving left.\n\nPossible moves: since head direction is L, I can move L (left), U (up), D (down), but not R (right) because that would be instant reverse, which is not allowed. Rule: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nCurrent direction is L, so opposite is R, so I cannot move right. Possible moves: L, U, D.\n\nNow, let's see the grid to avoid walls and body.\n\nGrid size: walls at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so playable area x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, but internal obstacle at (5,6), so (5,6) is blocked.\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (2,1)\n\nBody: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)\n\nTail: (5,5)\n\nNow, food at (2,5) and (6,4)\n\n(6,4) is a food position, but let's see if it's occupied.\n\nSnake positions: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)\n\n(6,4) is not listed in snake positions, so it should be free, but let's list all occupied cells.\n\nFrom snake: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)\n\nAlso walls: borders and (5,6)\n\nFood at (2,5) and (6,4)\n\n(2,5): not occupied, since snake is at (2,1) and others, y=5 not in positions except (4,4), (5,4), (5,5) which are y=4 and y=5 but x different.\n\n(2,5) is free.\n\n(6,4): snake has (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), but not (6,4), so (6,4) should be free? (6,4) is listed as food, and not in snake positions, so yes, free.\n\nBut snake has (5,4) and (5,5), but (6,4) is different.\n\n(6,4) is x=6,y=4.\n\nSnake positions: (6,3) is at (6,3), then (5,3), so (6,4) is not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) is x=2,y=5, not occupied.\n\nNow, for (6,4), it's food, but let's see if it's under snake body? No, it's not occupied, so it can be eaten directly if head moves there.\n\nBut there's a special case: food can spawn under body, but here it's not under body, so no issue.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nTail is at (5,5), which has no food, I assume. Food is at (2,5) and (6,4), not at tail.\n\nSo no immediate danger there.\n\nNow, current position: head (2,1), direction L.\n\nPossible moves from (2,1):\n\n- Left (L): to (1,1). But x=1,y=1, is it wall? Walls are x=0 and x=7 borders, so x=0 is wall, x=1 should be ok, since border is x=0. Similarly y=0 and y=7.\n\nPlayable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6, except obstacles.\n\n(1,1): x=1, y=1, should be within bounds, no wall mentioned except borders, so x=1 is not border wall? Border walls are x=0 and x=7, meaning cells with x=0 or x=7 are walls, similarly y=0 and y=7.\n\nInternal obstacle (5,6).\n\nSo (1,1) is x=1,y=1, both not 0 or 7, so it's free, but is it occupied by snake? Snake positions: (2,1), (3,1), etc., (1,1) not listed, so should be free.\n\nBut let's confirm: snake is at (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) on y=1, so (1,1) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, up (U): to (2,2), y=2, x=2.\n\n(2,2): not in snake positions, snake has (2,1), (3,1), etc., no (2,2), so free.\n\nDown (D): to (2,0), but y=0 is wall, since border y=0. So down to (2,0) is invalid, wall collision.\n\nLeft (L) to (1,1): valid, empty.\n\nUp (U) to (2,2): valid, empty.\n\nRight (R) to (3,1): but (3,1) is occupied by body, and since it's not the tail, moving there would cause collision.\n\nBody collision: head touches any body segment except the tail, because when moving to tail, the tail moves away.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, from (2,1), moving right to (3,1): (3,1) is the second segment, not tail, so it would collide.\n\nSimilarly, moving down to (2,0) is wall.\n\nSo possible actions: L to (1,1), or U to (2,2).\n\nCannot D or R.\n\nNow, I need to think ahead 5+ turns to maximize score and survival.\n\nFood available: (2,5) and (6,4), both positive.\n\n(2,5) has shorter life, only 6 turns left, so it might be a priority to get it soon.\n\nBut I need to plan a path.\n\nAlso, after moving, the snake grows only if it eats positive food.\n\nCurrent length: 12 segments.\n\nIf I eat (2,5), length becomes 13, and I get +1 score.\n\nSimilarly for (6,4).\n\nNow, let's see the grid to plan.\n\nI should sketch the grid mentally.\n\nGrid 6x6: x 1 to 6, y 1 to 6.\n\nWalls: borders (x=0,7; y=0,7) and (5,6) obstacle.\n\nSo cells: (1,1) to (6,6) except (5,6) blocked.\n\nSnake: head (2,1), body: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), tail (5,5)\n\nSo the snake is mostly on the bottom row, then up to (6,3), then left to (5,3), then up? (5,3) to (4,3), then to (4,4), then to (5,4), then to (5,5).\n\n(4,3) to (4,4) is up, then (4,4) to (5,4) right, then (5,4) to (5,5) up.\n\nTail at (5,5).\n\nFood at (2,5) and (6,4).\n\n(2,5) is top-left, y=5, x=2.\n\n(6,4) is bottom-right, x=6,y=4.\n\nNow, from head (2,1), I can go left to (1,1) or up to (2,2).\n\nI need to think which way to go to reach food safely.\n\nFirst, (2,5) is at (2,5), which is same column, different row.\n\nFrom (2,1) to (2,5), vertical distance.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) is far.\n\nBut (2,5) has shorter life span, only 6 turns, so I should try to get it within 6 turns.\n\nTurn 29 to 34 inclusive.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nCurrent possible moves:\n\nOption 1: Move Left to (1,1)\n\nThen head at (1,1), direction L (since moved left).\n\nThen from (1,1), possible moves: U to (1,2), D to (1,0) invalid, L to (0,1) invalid (wall), R to (2,1) but (2,1) is now body? After moving to (1,1), the snake moves, so positions change.\n\nWhen snake moves, the head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment before it, so tail is removed unless food eaten.\n\nSince no food eaten yet, when I move, tail moves away.\n\nSo if I move left to (1,1) at turn 29:\n\nNew positions: head (1,1), then body: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), and tail (5,5) is removed? Since no food, so snake grows only if eat positive food.\n\nAfter move, head at new position, body follows: segment 1 (after head) goes to old head position, segment 2 to old segment 1, etc., last segment (tail) is removed.\n\nSo from positions: before move: [(2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)]\n\nAfter move left to (1,1): head to (1,1), then body: first segment to old head (2,1), then (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4) — and tail (5,5) is gone, so 11 segments now? Original 12 segments, after move without eating, length same, but tail removed.\n\nPositions: 12 segments, after move, head new position, then 11 segments from old positions except tail removed.\n\nSo new positions: head (1,1), then (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), and (5,4) — (5,4) is the last? Let's index.\n\nOld positions: index 0: (2,1) head, 1: (3,1), 2: (4,1), 3: (5,1), 4: (6,1), 5: (6,2), 6: (6,3), 7: (5,3), 8: (4,3), 9: (4,4), 10: (5,4), 11: (5,5) tail.\n\nAfter move left: new head at (1,1), then segment 1 at old head (2,1), segment 2 at old segment 1 (3,1), ..., segment 11 at old segment 10 (5,4), and old tail (5,5) removed.\n\nSo new positions: [(1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)] — 12 segments? (5,4) is included, but old segment 10 was (5,4), which is now segment 11, and we have 12 positions.\n\nNumber of segments: from 0 to 11, 12 segments. After move without eating, the snake moves forward, so the last position is removed, so new snake has same length, positions from new head to the second last old segment? Standard snake movement.\n\nWhen no food eaten, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail cell is vacated.\n\nSo for positions list: new head position, then the old head position, then old segment 1 position, ..., up to old segment n-2 position, where n is length.\n\nLength 12, positions 0 to 11.\n\nAfter move, new head, then old position 0, then old position 1, ..., old position 10, and old position 11 (tail) is removed.\n\nSo new positions: [new_head, old_0, old_1, ..., old_10]\n\nHere old_0 is (2,1), old_1 is (3,1), ..., old_10 is (5,4), old_11 is (5,5) removed.\n\nSo new: head (1,1), then (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4) — (5,4) is old_10, so last is (5,4), which was the second last.\n\nPositions: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)\n\nSo tail at (5,4) now.\n\nSimilarly, if I move up to (2,2): new head (2,2), then body: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), and tail (5,5) removed, so tail at (5,4).\n\nBack to decision.\n\nOption 1: Move L to (1,1) at turn 29.\n\nThen head at (1,1), direction L.\n\nFrom (1,1), possible moves: U to (1,2), D invalid (y=0), L invalid (x=0), R to (2,1) but (2,1) is now body (second position), so collision if move there.\n\nSo only possible move is U to (1,2).\n\nThen at (1,2), direction U (since moved up).\n\nThen from (1,2), possible moves: U to (1,3), D to (1,1) but (1,1) is body now, collision, L invalid, R to (2,2) which may be free or not.\n\nAfter turn 29 move to (1,1), positions as above.\n\nAt turn 30, from (1,1), move U to (1,2).\n\nNew positions: head (1,2), then old head (1,1), then (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) — and (5,4) removed, tail at (4,4)? Let's not get into details unless necessary.\n\n(2,2) is free at that point, I think.\n\nFrom (1,2), can go U to (1,3), R to (2,2), D invalid, L invalid.\n\n(1,1) is body, so D invalid.\n\nSo U or R.\n\nIf I go to (1,2), then I can go to (1,3) or (2,2).\n\nBut I need to reach (2,5) or (6,4).\n\n(2,5) is at (2,5), so from (1,2), I can go up to (1,3), (1,4), etc. to (1,5), then right to (2,5), but (2,5) is food.\n\nSimilarly, from (2,2) if I go right first.\n\nBut let's see the other option.\n\nOption 2: Move U to (2,2) at turn 29.\n\nThen head at (2,2), direction U (since moved up).\n\nFrom (2,2), possible moves: U to (2,3), D to (2,1) but (2,1) is body, collision, L to (1,2), R to (3,2) which may be free.\n\nFirst, after turn 29 move U to (2,2): new positions head (2,2), then (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4) — tail at (5,4).\n\n(2,1) is now body, so D invalid.\n\nL to (1,2): should be free, since no snake or wall.\n\nR to (3,2): is it free? Snake positions: (3,1) is body, but (3,2) not listed, so should be free.\n\nU to (2,3): free.\n\nSo from (2,2), can go U, L, or R.\n\nNow, to reach (2,5), which is above, at (2,5).\n\nFrom (2,2), going up directly: (2,3), (2,4), (2,5).\n\nBut (2,3) and (2,4) are they free?\n\nCurrently, after turn 29 move to (2,2), positions: head (2,2), body (2,1), (3,1), etc.\n\n(2,3) not occupied, (2,4) not, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5) is food.\n\nSo I can go directly up to (2,5) in three moves: turn 30 to (2,3), turn 31 to (2,4), turn 32 to (2,5).\n\nThen eat at turn 32.\n\nLife span of (2,5) is 6 at turn 29, so at turn 30 it will be 5, turn 31:4, turn 32:3, so still available.\n\nTurn 32: when I move to (2,5), I eat it, so length increases.\n\nBut is there any risk?\n\n(2,4) to (2,5): when I move to (2,5), the food is eaten, so new tail grows, but need to check if I collide with anything.\n\n(2,5) is free, no issue.\n\nAfter eating, length 13.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nFrom current turn 29, if I move up to (2,2), then turn 30 move U to (2,3), turn 31 U to (2,4), turn 32 U to (2,5) eat.\n\nThen I have eaten (2,5) at turn 32.\n\nNow, what about (6,4)? It has longer life, until turn 37.\n\nAfter eating (2,5), I am at (2,5), need to go somewhere.\n\nBut I need to think beyond.\n\nFirst, compare to moving left.\n\nIf I move left to (1,1) at turn 29, then turn 30 must move U to (1,2) (only choice), then from (1,2), I can go to (1,3) or (2,2).\n\nTo reach (2,5), from (1,2), go U to (1,3), U to (1,4), U to (1,5), then R to (2,5).\n\nThat takes more turns: turn 30 to (1,2), turn 31 to (1,3), turn 32 to (1,4), turn 33 to (1,5), turn 34 to (2,5) eat at turn 34.\n\nLife span: at turn 29, L=6, turn 30 L=5, turn 31 L=4, turn 32 L=3, turn 33 L=2, turn 34 L=1, so at turn 34, I can still eat it before it disappears.\n\nBut it takes until turn 34, whereas if I go up directly, I eat at turn 32.\n\nSo going up is faster to get (2,5).\n\nMoreover, going left might be riskier because I am in corner.\n\nFor example, at (1,1), only one move up, then at (1,2), I have choices, but if I go to (1,5), it's a bit confined.\n\nWhereas from (2,2), I have more space.\n\nAlso, after eating (2,5), I need to go to (6,4) or other places.\n\nBut there might be other foods later, but currently only two.\n\nNow, let's consider (6,4).\n\n(6,4) is at (6,4), which is where? Snake has (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), and (5,4), etc.\n\nAfter some moves, it might be accessible.\n\nFor example, from current position, if I go to (2,5) via up, then I can go right or down to reach (6,4).\n\nBut (6,4) has life span 9, so plenty of time.\n\nNow, another thing: tail reward danger.\n\nCurrently tail is at (5,5), but after moves, it changes.\n\nBut when I eat (2,5), the tail will grow, but since I eat at head position, it should be fine.\n\nNow, let's think about the internal obstacle (5,6), which is blocked.\n\nAlso, (5,5) is tail, but after moves, it moves.\n\nPerhaps I should simulate the path to (2,5) via up.\n\nBut first, let's decide the action for turn 29.\n\nOption: move U to (2,2) seems better to reach (2,5) faster.\n\nMove L to (1,1) is slower and riskier.\n\nBut I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nAfter eating (2,5), I am at (2,5), then where to go?\n\nPossible moves from (2,5): after eating, head at (2,5), and since I ate, the tail doesn't move, so new positions: head (2,5), then the previous head position, etc., but let's not detail.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can move U, D, L, R, but direction is U since last move up to (2,5).\n\nLast move to (2,5) was up, so direction U.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (2,6), but y=6, is it wall? y=7 is border, y=6 should be playable? y from 1 to 6, y=6 is top, not wall, since walls y=0 and y=7.\n\ny=7 is wall, so y=6 is ok.\n\n(2,6) should be free, no snake or obstacle.\n\nThen D to (2,4), but (2,4) might be body or not.\n\nAfter eating at (2,5), let's see positions.\n\nBefore eating at turn 32: suppose turn 32 move to (2,5) from (2,4).\n\nAt turn 31, I am at (2,4), positions: let's trace.\n\nTurn 29: move U to (2,2)\n\nNew positions: head (2,2), body (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4) tail\n\nTurn 30: move U to (2,3)\n\nNew head (2,3), then (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) — and (5,4) removed, tail at (4,4)\n\n(5,4) was tail, removed.\n\nTurn 31: move U to (2,4)\n\nNew head (2,4), then (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) — and (4,4) removed? Old tail was (4,4) at turn 30? After turn 30, tail at (4,4)\n\nAfter turn 30: positions head (2,3), then (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) — (4,4) is last, tail.\n\nTurn 31 move U to (2,4): new head (2,4), then (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) — and (4,4) removed, so tail at (4,3)\n\nNow (2,4) is head.\n\nTurn 32: move U to (2,5) and eat food.\n\nSince eat positive food, snake grows, so new positions: head (2,5), then the previous head position (2,4) becomes new body, and tail not removed, so positions: head (2,5), then (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) — and since ate, the old tail (4,3) is not removed, so now 13 segments.\n\nLength increases by one.\n\nNow head at (2,5), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,6), D to (2,4) but (2,4) is body (second segment), so collision if move down, L to (1,5), R to (3,5).\n\n(2,4) is directly below, occupied by body, so D invalid.\n\nL to (1,5): should be free, R to (3,5) free, U to (2,6) free.\n\n(1,5) and (3,5) not occupied, (2,6) not.\n\nSo can go U, L, or R.\n\nNow, to reach (6,4), which is at bottom right.\n\nI need to move right and down.\n\nBut there is the internal obstacle at (5,6), and snake body.\n\nAlso, (6,4) is food, but let's see if I can reach it.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can go right to (3,5), then (4,5), but (4,5) might be free or not.\n\nCurrently, positions: (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)\n\nSo (4,5) not occupied, should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5) not occupied.\n\n(5,6) is obstacle.\n\nSo from (2,5), go R to (3,5), then R to (4,5), then? To go down, but (4,4) is occupied? (4,4) is not in positions, after eating, positions include (4,3), but (4,4) is free now? After turn 32, positions: head (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)\n\nSo (4,4) is not occupied, free.\n\n(4,4) was occupied earlier but not now.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) free, etc.\n\nSo from (4,5), I can go D to (4,4), then to (5,4), etc. to (6,4).\n\nBut (6,4) is at (6,4), and snake has (6,3), which is occupied.\n\n(6,3) is in positions, so (6,4) might be adjacent.\n\nBut let's plan the path to (6,4).\n\nFrom (2,5) at turn 32, after eating.\n\nTurn 32: head at (2,5), direction U.\n\nI need to go towards (6,4).\n\nFor example, move R to (3,5).\n\nThen direction R.\n\nTurn 33: from (3,5), can move R to (4,5), or U to (3,6), or D to (3,4), etc.\n\n(3,6) is y=6, ok.\n\nBut to go to (6,4), better to go right.\n\nSay move R to (4,5).\n\nThen turn 34: at (4,5), can move D to (4,4), or R to (5,5), or U to (4,6), or L to (3,5) but reverse? Direction is R, so opposite L not allowed? Last move to (4,5) was right, so direction R.\n\nCannot move L to (3,5), can move R, U, D.\n\n(5,5) is free, (4,4) free, (4,6) free.\n\nMove D to (4,4).\n\nThen turn 35: at (4,4), direction D (since moved down).\n\nCan move D to (4,3), but (4,3) is occupied by body? Positions at turn 34: let's not track all, but (4,3) is a body segment, so if I move to (4,3), collision.\n\nAt turn 32, positions include (4,3), and as time passes, the snake moves, but (4,3) might move away.\n\nAfter turn 32, positions: let's assume I move right each time for simplicity.\n\nBut to reach (6,4), from (4,4), I can move R to (5,4), then to (6,4).\n\nBut (6,4) might be available.\n\nLife span until turn 37, so time enough.\n\nBut let's see if (4,3) is still occupied.\n\nAt turn 32, positions: (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)\n\nEach turn, if no eat, tail moves.\n\nSuppose from turn 32, I move R to (3,5) at turn 32? Turn 32 is when I move to (2,5) and eat, so the move is at turn 32 to (2,5).\n\nThen for turn 33, I move from (2,5) to new position.\n\nSay move R to (3,5).\n\nNew positions: head (3,5), then (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) — and (4,3) removed since no eat, tail at (5,3)\n\nTurn 34: move R to (4,5)\n\nNew head (4,5), then (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) — tail at (6,3)\n\n(5,3) removed.\n\nTurn 35: move D to (4,4) — from (4,5) move down to (4,4)\n\nNew head (4,4), then (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) — tail at (6,2)\n\n(6,3) removed.\n\nNow at (4,4), I can move to (5,4), for example.\n\nTurn 36: move R to (5,4) — direction? Last move down to (4,4), so direction D.\n\nCan move R to (5,4), or U to (4,5) but (4,5) is body, collision, D to (4,3) but (4,3) may be free now? Positions: after turn 35, (4,3) not occupied, free.\n\nBut moving D to (4,3) is down, possible.\n\nBut to go to (6,4), better move R to (5,4).\n\nMove R to (5,4).\n\nNew head (5,4), then (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) — tail at (6,1)\n\n(6,2) removed.\n\nTurn 37: move R to (6,4)? From (5,4) to (6,4) is right, but (6,4) is adjacent to current head.\n\n(5,4) to (6,4) is +x, so right.\n\nBut (6,4) is the food position, so moving to (6,4) would eat it.\n\nBut is (6,4) occupied? No, it should be free.\n\nHowever, when I move to (6,4), I need to check if it causes collision.\n\nCurrent positions: head (5,4), body (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), etc.\n\n(6,4) is free.\n\nBut let's see what is at (6,4).\n\nAlso, the tail is at (6,1), not adjacent.\n\nSo move to (6,4) should be fine, eat at turn 37.\n\nLife span of (6,4) at turn 29 is 9, so turn 37: turn 29 L=9, turn 30 L=8, ..., turn 37 L=2, so available.\n\nEat at turn 37.\n\nNow, back to the beginning, if I go directly up at turn 29, I can eat (2,5) by turn 32, then (6,4) by turn 37, both eaten.\n\nBut what about the other option of moving left first?\n\nIf I move left to (1,1) at turn 29, then turn 30 must move U to (1,2), then I can go to (1,5) and eat (2,5) at turn 34, as I thought earlier.\n\nBut at turn 34, (2,5) life span L=1, still available, but later than turn 32.\n\nThen to eat (6,4), I start from (2,5) at turn 34, similar path but with less time, but (6,4) until turn 37, so turn 34 to 37: 4 turns, from (2,5) to (6,4) can be done in 4 moves? (2,5) to (3,5), (4,5), (5,4), (6,4) for example, 4 moves, so eat at turn 38, but turn 38: (6,4) life span at turn 29 L=9, turn 38 L=1? Turn 29: L=9, turn 30:8, ..., turn 37:2, turn 38:1, so at turn 38, L=1, can be eaten before decrease.\n\nTurn 38 move to (6,4), eat.\n\nBut turn 38 is after turn 37, so I might miss it if something, but L=1 at turn 38, so can eat.\n\nBut compared to first approach, I eat (2,5) later and (6,4) later or same? In first approach eat (6,4) at 37, here at 38.\n\nBut with moving left, I eat (2,5) at 34 instead of 32, so worse.\n\nMoreover, moving left might get me stuck.\n\nFor example, after (1,2), if I go to (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), then to (2,5), but at (1,5), I might have limited moves.\n\nWhereas with up move, I have more flexibility.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (6,4) is currently free, but is there any risk?\n\nIn the positions, (6,4) is near the snake body.\n\nBut in the path above, it should be fine.\n\nBut let's check if (6,4) is under body or something.\n\nCurrently at turn 29, food at (6,4), but snake has (6,3) and (5,4), adjacent, but not occupied.\n\nSpecial case: food can spawn under body, but here not, so ok.\n\nWhen I move to (6,4), as long as it's not colliding.\n\nIn the plan above, when I move to (6,4) from (5,4), it should be fine.\n\nBut in turn 37, when I move to (6,4), what is the cell behind?\n\nIn turn 36, head at (5,4), positions: let's not.\n\nI think it's safe.\n\nBut there is another point: tail reward danger.\n\nFor example, when I eat (6,4), if the tail is adjacent and has food, but here no food on tail, so ok.\n\nNow, back to turn 29 decision.\n\nMoving up seems better.\n\nBut I have to output multiple turns, not just one.\n\nThe answer format is to output actions for several turns, starting from t1.\n\n\"Answer Format: Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nAnd think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nSo for turn 29, I should choose move U.\n\nThen for subsequent turns, I can plan to go to (2,5) directly.\n\nThen after that, to (6,4).\n\nBut since the state might change, I need to output fixed actions, but I can plan a sequence.\n\nSince food might be eaten, but here only two.\n\nPerhaps I should output a sequence for 5 turns or so.\n\nTurn 29 to 33 or more.\n\nFirst, at turn 29: move U to (2,2)\n\nThen turn 30: move U to (2,3)\n\nTurn 31: move U to (2,4)\n\nTurn 32: move U to (2,5) eat\n\nNow at turn 32, head at (2,5), direction U.\n\nThen I need to go towards (6,4).\n\nPossible to move right.\n\nTurn 33: move R to (3,5)\n\nThen turn 34: move R to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 35: move D to (4,4)  // from (4,5) down to (4,4)\n\nThen turn 36: move R to (5,4)\n\nThen turn 37: move R to (6,4) eat\n\nBut at turn 35, when I move to (4,4), from (4,5), direction D.\n\nThen at (4,4), can I move to (5,4)? (5,4) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, to (6,4).\n\nBut when moving to (6,4) at turn 37, it might be close, but life span allows.\n\nI could go directly from (4,5) to (5,5) or something.\n\nBut (5,5) is free.\n\nAnother path: from (2,5) go to (3,5), (4,5), then to (5,5), but (5,6) is obstacle, so from (5,5) I can go down to (5,4), then to (6,4).\n\n(5,5) to (5,4) is down, then to (6,4) right.\n\nBut (5,4) might be occupied later? In the sequence above, it should be fine.\n\nTo save turns, from (4,5) go down to (4,4), then to (5,4), etc.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, for turn 33 to 37, it depends on the position after eating.\n\nBut I think the sequence is feasible.\n\nNow, what about the internal obstacle (5,6)? I avoided it.\n\nAlso, at (5,5), it's fine.\n\nNow, but in turn 29, if I move left, it's worse.\n\nBut is there a reason to move left? For example, to avoid something, but I don't see.\n\nAnother thing: the head is near the bottom, and moving up might be better for long-term, since (2,5) is there.\n\nMoreover, moving left gets me to corner.\n\nSo I think move U at turn 29 is best.\n\nThen for the answer, I need to output actions for several turns.\n\nLet's say from turn 29 to, say, turn 33 or more.\n\nBut turn 32 I eat (2,5), then I can continue.\n\nSince the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", and output the actions.\n\nPerhaps I can output up to when I eat both or something.\n\nBut let's see the format.\n\n\"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ... }\"\n\nAnd it should be a sequence.\n\nNow, for turn 29, action U.\n\nThen turn 30, to go to (2,3), must move U, assuming no other choices or better.\n\nAfter turn 29 move U to (2,2), at turn 30, from (2,2), I can move U to (2,3), or L to (1,2), or R to (3,2).\n\nBut to reach (2,5), moving U directly is best.\n\nSimilarly, at (2,2), if I move L or R, it delays reaching (2,5).\n\nSo I should move U at turn 30.\n\nSimilarly, turn 31 U to (2,4), turn 32 U to (2,5).\n\nThen at turn 32, after eating, I need to move away.\n\nPossible moves: U to (2,6), L to (1,5), R to (3,5).\n\nIf I go to (2,6), then I am at top, might be dead end if not careful.\n\n(2,6) is corner, but I can move left or right.\n\nBut to reach (6,4), better to go right directly.\n\nSo move R to (3,5) at turn 33.\n\nThen turn 34 R to (4,5), turn 35 D to (4,4), turn 36 R to (5,4), turn 37 R to (6,4).\n\nNow, at turn 35, from (4,5) to (4,4), is down.\n\nThen to (5,4), which is right from (4,4).\n\nBut at (4,4), direction is D (since moved down to (4,4)).\n\nThen moving R to (5,4) is not opposite, so ok.\n\nSimilarly, to (6,4).\n\nBut (6,4) might be eaten at turn 37.\n\nLife span ok.\n\nI could go from (4,5) directly to (5,5) at turn 35.\n\nMove R to (5,5) from (4,5).\n\nThen at (5,5), direction R.\n\nThen move D to (5,4) turn 36, then R to (6,4) turn 37.\n\nSame thing.\n\n(5,5) to (5,4) is down, then to (6,4) right.\n\nIn terms of distance, similar.\n\nBut with (5,6) obstacle, going to (5,5) is fine.\n\nIn the first path, going to (4,4) then (5,4) might be shorter if (4,4) is free.\n\nIn both cases, I reach (6,4) by turn 37.\n\nNow for the sequence, I can output actions up to turn 33 or so, but since I need to think ahead, perhaps output until I eat or something.\n\nThe answer should include the actions for the turns.\n\nSince the state changes, I should output a fixed sequence based on current knowledge.\n\nAssume no other foods, and I go for (2,5) then (6,4).\n\nSo for turn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U (to (2,3))\n\nTurn 31: U (to (2,4))\n\nTurn 32: U (to (2,5) eat)\n\nThen turn 33: R (to (3,5))\n\nTurn 34: R (to (4,5))\n\nNow at turn 34, I am at (4,5), then I need to go down to (4,4) or to (5,5).\n\nBut to output, I can continue.\n\nTurn 35: D (to (4,4)) or R (to (5,5)), say D to (4,4)\n\nThen turn 36: R (to (5,4))\n\nTurn 37: R (to (6,4) eat)\n\nBut I don't need to output all, since the problem might expect only a few turns, but it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", so at least 5 actions.\n\nFrom turn 29, 5 turns ahead: turn 29,30,31,32,33.\n\nActions: U,U,U,U,R for turns 29 to 33.\n\nAt turn 33, I move to (3,5).\n\nThen later to (4,5), etc.\n\nI think that's fine.\n\nBut in turn 32, I eat (2,5), so I need to specify.\n\nBut the actions are for movement.\n\nNow, what if I move left at turn 29? I think it's inferior.\n\nAnother consideration: the food at (6,4) is currently at (6,4), and in the snake positions, (6,3) is occupied, but not (6,4), so it's fine.\n\nBut there is a special case: if food is under body, but not here.\n\nAlso, tail reward danger not applicable.\n\nSo I think moving up is best.\n\nTherefore, for turn 29: action U.\n\nThen for the sequence, I can output:\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: U  // to (2,5)\n\nTurn 33: R  // to (3,5)\n\nAnd so on, but since it says \"...\" I can stop after a few.\n\nBut to be complete, I'll do up to turn 33.\n\nNow, in the boxed answer.\n\nAlso, confirm the directions.\n\nCurrent head direction L, I move U, which is not opposite, so ok.\n\nThen after that, directions change.\n\nBut I think it's fine.\n\nSo the actions:\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, the strategy involves eating the positive food at (2,5) first due to its shorter life span (6 turns remaining, disappearing after turn 34). This food can be reached safely by moving upward for four consecutive turns (turns 29 to 32). After eating at (2,5), the snake will then head toward the food at (6,4), which has a longer life span (9 turns remaining, disappearing after turn 37), by moving right for the next turns. This path avoids collisions and dead ends, leveraging the grid layout and snake positions.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Turn 29 Movement Options**: \n  - Current head position: (2,1), direction: L (left).\n  - Possible moves: \n    - L (left) to (1,1): Leads to a corner with limited escape routes, delaying access to (2,5) and risking dead ends.\n    - U (up) to (2,2): Directly advances toward (2,5) and provides more flexibility.\n    - D (down) to (2,0): Invalid (wall collision).\n    - R (right) to (3,1): Invalid (body collision with (3,1)).\n  - Moving up (U) is optimal to reach (2,5) quickly and avoid risks.\n- **Path to (2,5)**:\n  - From (2,1), moving up for three turns (turns 29-31) reaches (2,4) by turn 31.\n  - On turn 32, moving up to (2,5) eats the food, increasing length to 13. This is within the food's life span (available until turn 34).\n- **Path to (6,4)**:\n  - After eating at (2,5), moving right for two turns (turns 33-34) reaches (4,5) by turn 34.\n  - Then moving down to (4,4) on turn 35 and right to (5,4) on turn 36 sets up for eating (6,4) on turn 37 (within life span).\n- **Collision and Risk Avoidance**:\n  - The path avoids walls, the internal obstacle at (5,6), and body segments. For example:\n    - Moving up from (2,1) to (2,2) on turn 29 is safe as (2,2) is unoccupied.\n    - Moving to (2,5) on turn 32 is safe; no tail reward danger as the tail (at (4,3) after turn 31) is not adjacent and has no food.\n    - The sequence to (6,4) ensures no collisions; e.g., (6,4) is unoccupied when targeted.\n  - Instant reverse is prevented by direction management (e.g., after moving up, down is not immediately possible if occupied).\n- **5+ Turns Ahead Planning**:\n  - Turns 29-32: Focus on eating (2,5) efficiently to secure +1 score before it expires.\n  - Turns 33-37: Transition to (6,4) for another +1 score, using the grid's right side to avoid the snake's body cluster.\n  - Survival priority: The path maintains open space (e.g., after turn 32, moving right avoids the top-left corner) and allows future food access.\n\n### Action Sequence (Turns 29 to 33)\n- **Turn 29**: Move U (up) to (2,2) — Advances toward (2,5), avoids corner risk.\n- **Turn 30**: Move U (up) to (2,3) — Continues direct path to (2,5).\n- **Turn 31**: Move U (up) to (2,4) — Positions for eating (2,5) on next turn.\n- **Turn 32**: Move U (up) to (2,5) — Eats positive food (+1 score, length 13).\n- **Turn 33**: Move R (right) to (3,5) — Starts path toward (6,4), avoids reverse.\n\nThis sequence eats (2,5) by turn 32 and positions the snake to reach (6,4) by turn 37, maximizing score while ensuring survival. Beyond turn 33, the snake should continue right/down to (6,4).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 29: U \\\\\nTurn 30: U \\\\\nTurn 31: U \\\\\nTurn 32: U \\\\\nTurn 33: R\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm the AI playing Snake. I need to maximize my score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I must think at least 5 turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nHere's the current state:\n\n- Turn: 30\n- Walls: Border cells are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,6).\n- Snake positions: Head is at (2,2), and the body segments are: (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4). So the head is at (2,2), and the tail is at (5,4). I should list them in order: [(2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)]. That's 12 segments, so the snake length is 12.\n- Head direction: Up (U), which means it was moving upwards to (2,2) from (2,1), since positions are head first. From (2,1) to (2,2) is up, so direction U is correct.\n- Food:\n  - (2,5) with life span 5, value 1 (positive)\n  - (6,4) with life span 8, value 1 (positive)\n\nBoth foods are positive, so eating either gives +1 score and increases length by 1.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for the next few turns, starting from turn 30. The answer should include actions for turn 30, 31, 32, etc., but since it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead,\" I should plan a sequence, but the output is for multiple turns, like \"Turn 30: action, Turn 31: action, ...\" but it doesn't specify how many turns to output. Probably, I should output for as many as I can reasonably plan, but since the state might change, I should focus on the immediate action with a plan.\n\nThe answer format is to box the actions for several turns, like Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, etc. But in practice, for each move, I might only commit to one, but here I need to think ahead and show a sequence.\n\nRe-reading: \"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t1: action on turn t1, Turn t1+1: action on turn t1+1, ... }\"\n\nAnd it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should provide a sequence of at least 5 moves.\n\nBut the food life spans are short, 5 and 8 turns, so I need to consider that.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid. The grid is from x=0 to x=7 and y=0 to y=7, but walls are at borders, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also, internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- Head: (2,2)\n- Body: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)\n\nSo, let's sketch a grid:\n\nRows y=7 to y=0 (top to bottom? Usually in coordinates, y increases up or down? In grid, often y=0 bottom, but here it doesn't specify, but since head direction is U, moving to (2,2) from (2,1), so (2,1) to (2,2) is increasing y, so probably y increases upwards. Let's confirm.\n\nSnake positions: from head (2,2) to (2,1) — (2,1) has lower y, so if y=1 is below y=2, then moving from (2,1) to (2,2) is up, so y increases as we go up. Standard math coordinates.\n\nSet up grid:\n\n- x from 0 to 7, left to right.\n\n- y from 0 to 7, bottom to top? No: if (2,1) to (2,2) is up, and (2,1) has y=1, (2,2) has y=2, so higher y is up. So y=0 is bottom, y=7 is top.\n\nSimilarly, x=0 left, x=7 right.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. So the playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6? No.\n\nBorder cells are walls: so any cell with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7 is a wall. So the grid has walls on the borders.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nNow, cells: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6 are playable, except where walls or obstacles.\n\n(5,6) is an obstacle, so not accessible.\n\nNow, snake: head at (2,2), direction U (up).\n\nPossible moves: Since head direction is U, I can move U, L, or R, but not D because that would be instant reverse. Rules: \"No instant reverse: Cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn\"\n\nCurrent direction is U, so opposite is D, so I cannot move down on this turn.\n\nAllowed moves: U (same direction), L (left), R (right).\n\nNow, let's see the current position:\n\nGrid with snake:\n\nList cells:\n\n- (2,2): head\n\n- (2,1): body\n\n- (3,1): body\n\n- (4,1): body\n\n- (5,1): body\n\n- (6,1): body\n\n- (6,2): body\n\n- (6,3): body\n\n- (5,3): body\n\n- (4,3): body\n\n- (4,4): body\n\n- (5,4): tail\n\nFood at (2,5) and (6,4)\n\n(2,5): x=2,y=5\n\n(6,4): x=6,y=4\n\nLife span: (2,5) has life 5, meaning it disappears after 5 turns, including this turn? \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn 30, life span 5, so it will disappear after turn 34? Let's see.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn t, if life_span is L, it will be there for L more turns, including turn t. So after L turns, it disappears.\n\nFor (2,5): life span 5 at turn 30, so it exists on turns 30,31,32,33,34. Disappears after turn 34, meaning not there on turn 35.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) life span 8, exists until turn 37.\n\nNow, I need to think about eating food.\n\nFirst, check if head can eat food now.\n\nHead at (2,2), food at (2,5) and (6,4). Neither is adjacent to head.\n\nAdjacent cells to head (2,2): up (2,3), down (2,1), left (1,2), right (3,2).\n\nBut down (2,1) is occupied by body, so moving there would cause collision.\n\nAlso, walls: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so left to (1,2): x=1 is not wall, since walls are only borders, x=1 is playable. Similarly, y=1 is playable, but (2,1) has body.\n\nAvailable moves from (2,2) with direction U:\n\n- U: to (2,3)\n\n- L: to (1,2)\n\n- R: to (3,2)\n\nCannot D, opposite direction.\n\nNow, check what cells are safe.\n\nFirst, (2,3): is it free? From snake positions, (2,3) not listed, so should be free, but let's confirm all positions.\n\nSnake positions: (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)\n\nSo (2,3) not occupied, and not wall, so free.\n\n(1,2): x=1, y=2, not border wall, and not in snake, so free.\n\n(3,2): similarly, free.\n\nBut (3,2) might be close to body? Body has (3,1), which is below, but (3,2) is not occupied.\n\nNow, also, food at (2,5) and (6,4), not adjacent.\n\nI need to plan to eat food while avoiding risks.\n\nFirst, let's think about the tail. Tail is at (5,4), and it will move when the snake moves, unless it eats food.\n\nIf I eat food, the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows.\n\nBut there's a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nCurrently, tail is at (5,4), and there's no food there, so no issue.\n\nFood is at (2,5) and (6,4), not on tail.\n\n(6,4) is a food position, but snake has (6,3), (6,2), etc., but (6,4) is not occupied by snake, it's food.\n\nSnake positions don't include (6,4), so it's free for food.\n\nNow, let's think about paths.\n\nI should consider going towards (2,5) or towards (6,4).\n\n(2,5) has shorter life, only 5 turns, so I might prioritize it if possible.\n\nBut I need to survive.\n\nFirst, let's simulate possible moves.\n\nCurrent head at (2,2), direction U.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (2,3)\n\nThen head to (2,3), direction now U.\n\nFrom there, possible moves: U, L, R (since direction U, can't D)\n\nU to (2,4), then to (2,5) which has food.\n\nBut (2,4) is free? Let's see.\n\nCurrent cells: (2,4) not occupied, so yes.\n\nBut when I move to (2,3), the snake moves: head to (2,3), and tail? Since no food eaten, tail moves from (5,4) to... the body: when snake moves without eating, the tail segment is removed, so new tail is (4,3)? Let's see the body.\n\nAfter move U to (2,3):\n\nNew positions: head at (2,3), then body: previous positions except tail removed? Snake movement: when moving, the head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo positions: current: [(2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4)]\n\nAfter moving head to (2,3), the body segments shift: the first body segment (2,1) moves to where head was, (2,2), but no: the segment that was at index 1 moves to index 0's old position? Standard snake: the head moves to new position, and each subsequent segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo after move to (2,3):\n\n- New head: (2,3)\n\n- Segment 1 (was at (2,1)) moves to (2,2) — where head was\n\n- Segment 2 (was at (3,1)) moves to (2,1) — where segment 1 was\n\n- Segment 3 (was at (4,1)) moves to (3,1) — where segment 2 was\n\nAnd so on.\n\nList new positions:\n\n- Head: (2,3)\n\n- Body: (2,2) [previous head]\n\n- Then (2,1) [previous segment 1]\n\n- (3,1) [previous segment 2]\n\n- (4,1) [prev seg3]\n\n- (5,1) [prev seg4]\n\n- (6,1) [prev seg5]\n\n- (6,2) [prev seg6]\n\n- (6,3) [prev seg7]\n\n- (5,3) [prev seg8]\n\n- (4,3) [prev seg9]\n\n- (4,4) [prev seg10] — but prev seg10 was (4,4), which was at index 10, and after move, it moves to where prev seg9 was? Let's index properly.\n\nPositions list: index 0: head (2,2), index 1: (2,1), index 2: (3,1), index 3: (4,1), index 4: (5,1), index 5: (6,1), index 6: (6,2), index 7: (6,3), index 8: (5,3), index 9: (4,3), index 10: (4,4), index 11: (5,4) tail.\n\nAfter moving head to (2,3):\n\n- New head: (2,3)\n\n- New position for index 1: old position of index 0, which is (2,2)\n\n- New for index 2: old position of index 1, which is (2,1)\n\n- New for index 3: old of index 2, (3,1)\n\n- New for index 4: old of index 3, (4,1)\n\n- New for index 5: old of index 4, (5,1)\n\n- New for index 6: old of index 5, (6,1)\n\n- New for index 7: old of index 6, (6,2)\n\n- New for index 8: old of index 7, (6,3)\n\n- New for index 9: old of index 8, (5,3)\n\n- New for index 10: old of index 9, (4,3)\n\n- New for index 11: old of index 10, (4,4)  -- but index 11 was tail at (5,4), which is not occupied anymore, so the tail segment at index 11 is removed, and index 10 becomes the new tail at (4,3)? No.\n\nWhen no food eaten, the tail is removed, so the new snake has one less segment? No, in snake, when no food, the tail moves, so the last segment is removed.\n\nPositions: after move, the new positions are: head at new position, then each body segment at the previous position of the segment before it.\n\nSo for a snake of length L, after move without eating, new positions: [new_head] + positions[0:-1]  but positions[0:-1] are the old positions from head to second last.\n\nStandard: new body segments are the old positions from index 0 to L-2, but index 0 is head, so it's confusing.\n\nBetter to think: the head moves to a new cell. Then, each body segment from neck to tail-1 moves to the position of the next segment towards head? No.\n\nTypically, in a list, snake[0] is head, snake[1] to snake[L-1] are body.\n\nAfter moving to a new cell new_pos:\n\n- New snake[0] = new_pos\n\n- New snake[1] = old snake[0]\n\n- New snake[2] = old snake[1]\n\n- ...\n\n- New snake[k] = old snake[k-1] for k from 1 to L-1\n\nThen the last segment old snake[L-1] is removed, so the new snake has the same length, but the tail is at old snake[L-2] position? No.\n\nNew snake has positions: [new_pos, old_snake[0], old_snake[1], ..., old_snake[L-2]]\n\nSo for L segments, after move, new snake has L segments: head at new_pos, then the first L-1 segments of the old snake except the tail is gone.\n\nOld snake: indices 0 to 11, 12 segments.\n\nAfter move to (2,3):\n\nNew snake[0] = (2,3)\n\nNew snake[1] = old snake[0] = (2,2)\n\nNew snake[2] = old snake[1] = (2,1)\n\nNew snake[3] = old snake[2] = (3,1)\n\nNew snake[4] = old snake[3] = (4,1)\n\nNew snake[5] = old snake[4] = (5,1)\n\nNew snake[6] = old snake[5] = (6,1)\n\nNew snake[7] = old snake[6] = (6,2)\n\nNew snake[8] = old snake[7] = (6,3)\n\nNew snake[9] = old snake[8] = (5,3)\n\nNew snake[10] = old snake[9] = (4,3)\n\nNew snake[11] = old snake[10] = (4,4)  // old snake[10] is (4,4)\n\nOld snake[11] was (5,4), not used, so removed. New tail at (4,4)\n\nOld snake positions: index 10: (4,4), index 11: (5,4)\n\nAfter move, new snake[11] = old snake[10] = (4,4), and old snake[11] is gone.\n\nSo new positions: head (2,3), then (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) — tail at (4,4)\n\nLength still 12.\n\nNow, back to choices at turn 30.\n\nFrom (2,2), move to (2,3), (1,2), or (3,2).\n\nIf I move U to (2,3), then from there, I can go U to (2,4), then U to (2,5) to eat food on turn 32? Let's see turns.\n\nTurn 30: move from (2,2) to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 31: at (2,3), move U to (2,4)\n\nTurn 32: at (2,4), move U to (2,5) — if I eat food at (2,5), which has value 1, so snake grows, length increases to 13, and tail doesn't move.\n\nBut when I move to (2,5), if it's food, I eat it, so the head moves to (2,5), and the body segments shift, but the tail stays in place, so new segment is added at the tail position.\n\nSpecifically: when eating food, head moves to food cell, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position, so snake grows by one.\n\nPositions: new head at food, then old head, then the rest, and new tail at old tail position.\n\nBut in this case, moving to (2,5) on turn 32.\n\nBut (2,5) has food with life span 5 at turn 30, so at turn 32, it should still be there, life span decreases to 3 at turn 30, 2 at 31, 1 at 32, so at turn 32, it has life 1, so if I move there, I eat it before it disappears.\n\nLife span at turn 30: 5, so turn 30: life 5, exists; turn 31: life 4; turn 32: life 3; turn 33: life 2; turn 34: life 1; disappears after turn 34, so on turn 32, life span 3, still there.\n\nI can eat it on turn 32.\n\nBut is it safe to go to (2,5)? After eating, the snake grows, so I need to avoid colliding with body.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, from (2,2), if I move U to (2,3), it seems safe.\n\nThen from (2,3), I can move U to (2,4), which is also free, no issue.\n\nThen to (2,5) to eat.\n\nBut after eating at (2,5), the snake is longer, and I need to move away.\n\nFrom (2,5), after eating, head at (2,5), direction U.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (2,6), but y=6, and y=7 is wall, so (2,6) is playable? Walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is not wall, should be free.\n\ny from 0 to 7, walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to 6 are playable, similarly x=1 to 6.\n\n(2,6) is at x=2,y=6, not wall, and not occupied, should be free.\n\nThen I can move U to (2,6), but then I'm at top, y=6, and walls at y=7, but (2,6) is ok, but from there, I can only move L or R or D, not U because y=7 is wall.\n\nBut moving to (2,6) might be ok, but I need to think further.\n\nAlternative, from (2,5), I could move L or R.\n\nBut let's see the other food at (6,4).\n\nIf I go for (2,5), I can eat it quickly.\n\nBut there's a risk? Also, the snake body is mostly at the bottom, so going up might be safer.\n\nNow, another option: move L or R from (2,2).\n\nIf move L to (1,2): (1,2) is free, not wall, not snake.\n\nThen head at (1,2), direction L (since I moved left).\n\nThen from there, possible moves: L, U, D, but not R (opposite).\n\nL to (0,2), but x=0 is wall, so cannot move L, collision.\n\nU to (1,3), D to (1,1).\n\n(1,1) might be occupied? Current positions: (2,1) is body, but (1,1) is free? Let's see, (1,1) not in snake positions, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) free.\n\nBut if I move to (1,2), I'm near the left wall.\n\nThen from (1,2), I can only go U or D, since L is wall.\n\nGo U to (1,3), then to (1,4), etc., but no food nearby, and (2,5) is at (2,5), so I can go from (1,3) to (2,3) to (2,4) to (2,5), but that might take more turns.\n\nTurn 30: move L to (1,2)\n\nThen turn 31: from (1,2) move U to (1,3)  (assuming direction L, but after move, direction is L, so I can move U or D or L, but L to (0,2) wall, so only U or D.\n\nSay move U to (1,3)\n\nThen turn 32: from (1,3) move R to (2,3)? But direction is from (1,2) to (1,3), so moving U, direction U.\n\nThen from (1,3) direction U, can move U, L, R.\n\nL to (0,3) wall, U to (1,4), R to (2,3)\n\nThen to (2,3), then turn 33 to (2,4), turn 34 to (2,5), but at turn 34, food at (2,5) has life span decreasing: turn 30:5, 31:4, 32:3, 33:2, 34:1, so on turn 34 it is there, I can eat.\n\nBut compared to moving U directly, I can eat on turn 32, here on turn 34, which is later, and life span is low, but still possible.\n\nBut moving L first might not be efficient.\n\nSimilarly, moving R from (2,2) to (3,2).\n\n(3,2) is free.\n\nThen head at (3,2), direction R (since moved right).\n\nThen from there, possible moves: R, U, D, not L.\n\nR to (4,2), U to (3,3), D to (3,1).\n\nBut (3,1) is body? Current positions, (3,1) is body, so moving to (3,1) would collide.\n\nD to (3,1) is down, but (3,1) is occupied, so cannot.\n\nSo from (3,2), I can move R to (4,2) or U to (3,3).\n\n(4,2) is free? Not in snake, yes.\n\n(3,3) free.\n\nIf I go to (3,2), then I can go towards the food at (6,4).\n\n(6,4) is at x=6,y=4.\n\nFrom (3,2), I can move R to (4,2), then R to (5,2), but (5,2) is free? Current, (5,1) is body, (5,3) body, (5,2) not listed, so free.\n\nThen to (6,2), but (6,2) is body? Current positions, (6,2) is body, but when I move, it might move.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\nFirst, at turn 30, if I move R to (3,2).\n\nThen new positions: head (3,2), body: (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) — tail at (4,4)? After move to (3,2):\n\nNew head (3,2)\n\nNew snake[1] = old head (2,2)\n\nNew snake[2] = old [1] (2,1)\n\nNew snake[3] = old [2] (3,1)\n\nNew snake[4] = old [3] (4,1)\n\nNew snake[5] = old [4] (5,1)\n\nNew snake[6] = old [5] (6,1)\n\nNew snake[7] = old [6] (6,2)\n\nNew snake[8] = old [7] (6,3)\n\nNew snake[9] = old [8] (5,3)\n\nNew snake[10] = old [9] (4,3)\n\nNew snake[11] = old [10] (4,4)  // tail\n\nOld (5,4) removed.\n\nSo tail at (4,4)\n\nNow, from (3,2), I can move to (4,2) or (3,3) or (3,1) but (3,1) is occupied by snake[3], so cannot.\n\nSay move R to (4,2)\n\nThen turn 31: head to (4,2), direction R.\n\nNew positions: head (4,2), body (3,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) — tail at (4,3)? After move to (4,2):\n\nNew head (4,2)\n\nNew [1] = old head (3,2)\n\nNew [2] = old [1] (2,2)\n\nNew [3] = old [2] (2,1)\n\nNew [4] = old [3] (3,1)\n\nNew [5] = old [4] (4,1)\n\nNew [6] = old [5] (5,1)\n\nNew [7] = old [6] (6,1)\n\nNew [8] = old [7] (6,2)\n\nNew [9] = old [8] (6,3)\n\nNew [10] = old [9] (5,3)\n\nNew [11] = old [10] (4,3)  // tail\n\nYes.\n\nThen from (4,2), move R to (5,2), which is free.\n\nTurn 32: to (5,2), direction R.\n\nThen from (5,2), move R to (6,2), but (6,2) is occupied? In new positions, (6,2) is body, but let's see when I move.\n\nAt turn 32, positions before move: head at (5,2)? No.\n\nAfter turn 31, head at (4,2)\n\nThen turn 32, move to (5,2)\n\nNew head (5,2)\n\nNew body: (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) — and tail at (5,3)? Let's:\n\nNew [1] = old head (4,2)\n\nNew [2] = old [1] (3,2)\n\nNew [3] = old [2] (2,2)\n\nNew [4] = old [3] (2,1)\n\nNew [5] = old [4] (3,1)\n\nNew [6] = old [5] (4,1)\n\nNew [7] = old [6] (5,1)\n\nNew [8] = old [7] (6,1)\n\nNew [9] = old [8] (6,2)\n\nNew [10] = old [9] (6,3)\n\nNew [11] = old [10] (5,3)  // tail\n\nSo (6,2) is occupied by new [9], so at turn 32, if I move to (5,2), then to (6,2) on turn 33? From (5,2), I can move to (6,2) on turn 33.\n\n(6,2) is the position of new [9] at that time, but when I move, the body shifts.\n\nAt turn 33, from head at (5,2), move R to (6,2)\n\nBut (6,2) is currently occupied by the body segment at index 9, which is part of the snake, so moving there would cause collision with body.\n\nTherefore, I cannot move to (6,2) because it is occupied.\n\nSimilarly, I can move U or D from (5,2).\n\nU to (5,3), but (5,3) is also occupied, by new [11] tail at (5,3), so also occupied.\n\nD to (5,1), which is occupied by new [7] (5,1), so all directions from (5,2) are blocked? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 32 after move to (5,2), positions:\n\nHead (5,2)\n\nBody: (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nSo adjacent cells to (5,2):\n\n- U: (5,3) occupied by body\n\n- D: (5,1) occupied by body\n\n- L: (4,2) occupied by body\n\n- R: (6,2) occupied by body\n\nAll adjacent cells are occupied! So from (5,2), I cannot move anywhere without colliding. That's a dead end.\n\nTherefore, moving right to (3,2) on turn 30 leads to a trap at (5,2) on turn 32, where I have no safe moves. So that's very bad.\n\nThus, moving R from (2,2) is dangerous and should be avoided.\n\nSimilarly, moving L to (1,2) might not be great, but let's see.\n\nIf move L to (1,2) on turn 30.\n\nThen head at (1,2), direction L.\n\nThen possible moves: U to (1,3), D to (1,1), or L to (0,2) wall, so only U or D.\n\nSay move U to (1,3) on turn 31.\n\nThen head at (1,3), direction U (since moved up).\n\nThen from there, can move U to (1,4), L to (0,3) wall, R to (2,3), D to (1,2) but (1,2) is now body? After turn 30 move to (1,2), positions: head (1,2), body (2,2), (2,1), etc. tail (4,4) as before.\n\nThen turn 31 move U to (1,3): new head (1,3), body: (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) tail.\n\nNow (1,2) is body, so from (1,3), D to (1,2) occupied, so cannot.\n\nCan move U to (1,4) or R to (2,3).\n\n(2,3) is free.\n\nThen I can go to (2,3), then to (2,4), etc.\n\nBut it takes time, and for (2,5) food, I might be late.\n\nMoreover, the left side has fewer options.\n\nTherefore, the best immediate move is probably U to (2,3) on turn 30.\n\nThen from there, I can go to (2,4) and eat (2,5) on turn 32.\n\nNow, I need to think beyond that.\n\nAlso, there is another food at (6,4) with longer life, but I should eat (2,5) first since it expires sooner.\n\nNow, after eating at (2,5), what next.\n\nFirst, plan turn 30: move U to (2,3)\n\nThen turn 31: from (2,3), I need to move towards food. Since direction is U, I can move U to (2,4)\n\nThen turn 32: move U to (2,5), eat food. Snake grows to length 13.\n\nAfter eating at (2,5) on turn 32:\n\nHead at (2,5), and since I ate, new segment added, so tail stays, positions: the head moves to (2,5), and the body is the old positions without removing tail.\n\nSpecifically: new head at (2,5), then old head at (2,4)? Let's.\n\nBefore turn 32 move, at turn 31, after moves.\n\nTurn 30: move U to (2,3), so positions: head (2,3), body (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), ..., up to tail (4,4) as earlier.\n\nTurn 31: move U to (2,4)\n\nNew positions: head (2,4), body: (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)  // tail at (4,4)\n\nLength 12.\n\nThen turn 32: move U to (2,5), which has food, so eat it.\n\nNew head at (2,5)\n\nThen new body: old head (2,4), then old body positions: (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), and since ate, add new segment at old tail position (4,4), so new tail at (4,4).\n\nOld tail was (4,4), and it stays, but new segment added there.\n\nPositions: new snake[0] = (2,5)  // head\n\nnew snake[1] = old snake[0] = (2,4)\n\nnew snake[2] = old snake[1] = (2,3)\n\nnew snake[3] = old snake[2] = (2,2)\n\nnew snake[4] = old snake[3] = (2,1)\n\nnew snake[5] = old snake[4] = (3,1)\n\n...\n\nup to new snake[11] = old snake[10] = (4,3)  // old snake[10] was (4,3) in turn 31 positions? Let's index.\n\nAt turn 31 after move: positions: [ (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4) ]? Length 12, so indices 0 to 11: index 0: (2,4), 1: (2,3), 2: (2,2), 3: (2,1), 4: (3,1), 5: (4,1), 6: (5,1), 7: (6,1), 8: (6,2), 9: (6,3), 10: (5,3), 11: (4,3)? No.\n\nEarlier for turn 31: head (2,4), snake[1] (2,3), snake[2] (2,2), snake[3] (2,1), snake[4] (3,1), snake[5] (4,1), snake[6] (5,1), snake[7] (6,1), snake[8] (6,2), snake[9] (6,3), snake[10] (5,3), snake[11] (4,3)  // tail at (4,3)? I think I confused.\n\nFrom turn 30 to turn 31:\n\nTurn 30 after move U: positions: head (2,3), body: (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)  // index 0: (2,3), 1: (2,2), 2: (2,1), 3: (3,1), 4: (4,1), 5: (5,1), 6: (6,1), 7: (6,2), 8: (6,3), 9: (5,3), 10: (4,3), 11: (4,4)\n\nTurn 31 move U to (2,4): new head (2,4), new body: old head (2,3), then old body: (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), and old tail (4,4) is removed? No, when no eat, tail removed.\n\nNew positions: [ (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) ]  // new tail at (4,3)\n\nOld (4,4) removed.\n\nLength 12.\n\nThen turn 32 move U to (2,5) and eat: new head (2,5), then body: old positions [ (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) ], and add new segment at old tail position (4,3), so new tail at (4,3)? No.\n\nWhen eating, the new body includes all old segments plus a new segment at the old tail position.\n\nSo new positions: head at (2,5), then the old head at (2,4), then old body segments, and the last segment is the new one at the position where the tail was before the move.\n\nBefore move, tail was at (4,3).\n\nAfter move to (2,5), the body is: (2,4) (old head), then (2,3) (old neck), etc., up to (4,3) (old tail, but now it's a body segment), and since we ate, we add a new segment at the position the tail was before the move, which is (4,3), but (4,3) is already occupied by the segment that was there.\n\nI think I have a mistake.\n\nStandard: when snake eats, the head moves to the food cell, the body follows as usual, but the tail does not move, so the last segment stays, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so the snake grows by one.\n\nPositions: suppose before move, positions P = [head, seg1, seg2, ..., tail]\n\nMove to new cell (food), then new positions: [new_head, head, seg1, seg2, ..., tail]  and the tail position is duplicated, so new segment added.\n\nIn list: new snake = [new_head] + P\n\nSo length increases by one.\n\nFor example: before move, positions P = [A, B, C, D] with A head, D tail.\n\nMove to E (food), new snake = [E, A, B, C, D] so now tail is D, but D was tail, now it's body, and new tail is D? No, [E, A, B, C, D] so positions E,A,B,C,D, with D tail.\n\nBut D was already there, so the cell D has the tail, but it was occupied, so it's fine.\n\nIn terms of grid, the tail stays, so the new segment is at the old tail position.\n\nIn this case, for turn 32:\n\nBefore move at turn 31: positions [ (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) ] head (2,4), tail (4,3)\n\nMove to (2,5) food: new head (2,5), new positions: [ (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) ] so tail at (4,3), length 13.\n\nThe new segment is added at (4,3), which was the tail position.\n\nNow, head at (2,5), direction U.\n\nNow, possible moves: U to (2,6), L to (1,5), R to (3,5), D to (2,4) but (2,4) is body, occupied, so cannot move D.\n\nAlso, U to (2,6): free? (2,6) not wall, not occupied, should be free.\n\nL to (1,5): free, R to (3,5): free.\n\nNow, I need to avoid the body.\n\nAlso, there is food at (6,4) with life span 8, so at turn 30, life 8, turn 31:7, turn 32:6, turn 33:5, etc., so plenty of time.\n\nAfter being at (2,5), I should move to a safe area.\n\nIf I move U to (2,6), then I'm at top row.\n\nFrom (2,6), direction U, can move L to (1,6), R to (3,6), or D to (2,5) but (2,5) is body, occupied, so only L or R.\n\nSay move L to (1,6) or R to (3,6).\n\nThen I can go along the top.\n\nBut the body is below, so I might have space.\n\nI could move directly towards (6,4).\n\nFrom (2,5), instead of U, I could move L or R.\n\nFor example, move R to (3,5) on turn 33.\n\nThen to (4,5), (5,5), but (5,5) might be ok, then to (6,5), then down to (6,4) to eat.\n\n(6,4) is at y=4, so from (6,5) to (6,4) down.\n\nBut there is an obstacle at (5,6), which is above, but (5,5) is fine.\n\nAlso, need to check if (6,4) is accessible.\n\nCurrently, at turn 32 after eating, positions include (6,3), (5,3), etc., but they will move.\n\nLet's plan a sequence.\n\nFirst, for turn 30: move U to (2,3)\n\nTurn 31: move U to (2,4)\n\nTurn 32: move U to (2,5) eat food. Now snake longer.\n\nThen turn 33: from (2,5), I need to move. To avoid being trapped, I should not go up if possible, but I can move R to (3,5), for example.\n\nAssume direction U, so after moving U to (2,5), direction U.\n\nTurn 33: from (2,5), move R to (3,5) -- is this allowed? Direction U, moving R is right, not opposite, so yes.\n\nThen head to (3,5), direction R.\n\nNow positions: after move to (3,5) on turn 33.\n\nBefore move, at turn 32: positions [ (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) ] head (2,5), tail (4,3)\n\nMove to (3,5): no food there, so just move, tail moves.\n\nNew head (3,5), new body: old head (2,5), then old body except tail removed? No eat, so new positions: [ (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) ] new tail at (5,3)\n\nOld tail (4,3) removed.\n\nNow head at (3,5), direction R.\n\nThen turn 34: move to (4,5), for example, which should be free.\n\nNew head (4,5), body: (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), etc. tail at (6,3)? After move: [ (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) ] tail (6,3)\n\n(6,3) was body, now tail.\n\nThen turn 35: move to (5,5), free.\n\nNew head (5,5), body: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), etc. tail at (6,2)? [ (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) ] tail (6,2)\n\nNow (5,5) is near the obstacle at (5,6), but (5,6) is obstacle, so cannot go there.\n\nFrom (5,5), I can move to (6,5) or (5,4) or (4,5) but (4,5) is body.\n\nDirection from moving to (5,5), say I moved R from (4,5) to (5,5), so direction R.\n\nThen turn 36: move to (6,5), since R to (6,5).\n\n(6,5) should be free.\n\nNew head (6,5), body: (5,5), (4,5), etc. tail at (6,1)? After move: [ (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) ] tail (6,1)\n\nNow head at (6,5), direction R.\n\nFood at (6,4) is below, so I need to move down.\n\nBut direction R, moving down is D, which is not opposite, so can move D to (6,4).\n\n(6,4) has food, so eat it on turn 37? Turn 36 move to (6,5), turn 37 move to (6,4).\n\nAt turn 37, (6,4) has life span: initial at turn 30:8, turn 31:7, ..., turn 37:1, so still there.\n\nEat at (6,4), snake grows to 14.\n\nBut when I move to (6,4) from (6,5), down, so I eat.\n\nBut is there any danger? The tail is at (6,1), and body includes (6,2), (6,3), but when I move to (6,4), it should be fine.\n\nAfter eating, head at (6,4), and new segment added.\n\nThen I need to move away.\n\nPossible moves: from (6,4), after moving D, direction D.\n\nCan move L, R, D, not U.\n\nL to (5,4), but (5,4) might be occupied? Need to see positions.\n\nBefore move at turn 36: positions [ (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) ] head (6,5), tail (6,1)\n\nMove to (6,4) on turn 37: eat, so new head (6,4), new positions: [ (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) ] so tail at (6,1), but (6,1) is occupied, but it's part of snake, fine.\n\nNow head at (6,4), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: D to (6,3), but (6,3) is not in positions? Positions have (6,4), (6,5), ..., down to (6,1), so (6,3) is not listed, but (6,2) and (6,4) are, (6,3) should be free? Let's see: positions: (6,4) head, (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), ..., (2,5), (2,4), ..., down to (6,1), so (6,3) is not occupied, since between (6,4) and (6,2)? (6,2) is at index? List: indices: 0: (6,4), 1: (6,5), 2: (5,5), 3: (4,5), 4: (3,5), 5: (2,5), 6: (2,4), 7: (2,3), 8: (2,2), 9: (2,1), 10: (3,1), 11: (4,1), 12: (5,1), 13: (6,1) tail.\n\nSo (6,3) not occupied, free.\n\nSimilarly, L to (5,4), free? (5,4) not in list, should be free.\n\nR: but x=6, right is x=7 wall, cannot.\n\nD to (6,3), or L to (5,4), or U to (6,5) but (6,5) is body, occupied.\n\nDirection D, so can move D, L, R, but R wall, U opposite, so only D or L.\n\nMove D to (6,3) or L to (5,4).\n\nSay move L to (5,4) to go left.\n\nThen continue.\n\nThis seems feasible.\n\nBut in this plan, I ate both foods.\n\nNow, back to turn 30, I need to start with U.\n\nBut earlier, moving R was bad, L is possible but slower for first food.\n\nSo U is best.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I need to output actions for several turns.\n\nSince I thought 5+ turns, I can output up to turn 35 or so.\n\nBut let's list the actions:\n\nTurn 30: U (to (2,3))\n\nTurn 31: U (to (2,4))\n\nTurn 32: U (to (2,5) eat)\n\nThen turn 33: from (2,5), I moved R to (3,5)\n\nIn the sequence, I need to specify.\n\nAfter turn 32, head at (2,5), direction U.\n\nThen for turn 33, I can choose to move R, as I did.\n\nSimilarly, turn 34: to (4,5)\n\nBut in the plan, from (3,5) to (4,5), which is R.\n\nTurn 35: to (5,5)\n\nTurn 36: to (6,5)\n\nTurn 37: to (6,4) eat\n\nBut I need only 5+ turns, so up to turn 34 or 35.\n\nTurn 30 to 34 is 5 turns.\n\nBut at turn 34, in the plan, after turn 33 move to (3,5), turn 34 move to (4,5)\n\nThen I can stop or continue.\n\nSince the food (6,4) is later, I can output fewer turns.\n\nBut to show the plan, I can output until after eating first food.\n\nNow, another thing: when I go to (2,5), I could move L instead of R, but R is towards the other food.\n\nIn the grid, after eating at (2,5), the body is around (2,1) to (2,4), so moving R to (3,5) is safe.\n\nI could move U to (2,6), but then I might be cornered.\n\nFor example, if turn 33 move U to (2,6), then at (2,6), direction U.\n\nThen can only move L or R, say R to (3,6), then to (4,6), but (4,6) near obstacle (5,6), then I need to go down, etc., might be more messy.\n\nWhereas going right directly towards (6,4) seems efficient.\n\nAlso, in terms of survival, the bottom right has more space? Not necessarily, but with the plan, it works.\n\nNow, about the tail reward danger: at some point, if tail has food, but in this case, no food on tail, so fine.\n\nAlso, food under body: but here, foods are not under body, so no issue.\n\nTherefore, for the answer:\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: U (eat food at (2,5))\n\nThen turn 33: R (to (3,5))\n\nTurn 34: R (to (4,5))\n\nAnd so on, but since the format is to box, and think ahead, I can provide up to turn 34 or 35.\n\nTurn 35: from (4,5) to (5,5), which is R.\n\nIn direction, when I move from (3,5) to (4,5), direction R, then to (5,5) is R again.\n\nBut (5,5) is free.\n\nNow, to be precise, I should output for turns 30 to 34, for example.\n\nt1=30, so turns 30,31,32,33,34.\n\nThat's 5 turns.\n\nAt turn 34, in the plan, head at (4,5), which is safe.\n\nThen I can continue later.\n\nSince the second food is not urgent, this is fine.\n\nI could include one more to show.\n\nBut let's see the life span: (2,5) eaten on 32, (6,4) later.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I will plan a sequence of moves starting from turn 30, thinking at least 5 turns ahead. The key objectives are:\n- Prioritize eating the positive food at (2,5) due to its shorter life span (5 turns at turn 30, so it disappears after turn 34). This food can be safely eaten by turn 32.\n- Avoid the dangerous move right (R) from (2,2) on turn 30, as it leads to a dead end at (5,2) on turn 32 with no safe moves.\n- After eating (2,5), navigate toward the other food at (6,4) with a longer life span (8 turns at turn 30), eating it around turn 37.\n- Ensure all moves avoid walls, obstacles, and body collisions, considering the snake's growth after eating.\n\n### Analysis of Current State (Turn 30)\n- **Head position**: (2,2), direction U (up).\n- **Available moves**: \n  - U to (2,3): Safe, free cell.\n  - L to (1,2): Safe but leads to a less efficient path for reaching food.\n  - R to (3,2): Unsafe, as it traps the snake at (5,2) on turn 32 with all adjacent cells occupied.\n- **Food priorities**: \n  - (2,5): Life span 5, must be eaten by turn 34. Best path: move U for 3 turns (turns 30-32).\n  - (6,4): Life span 8, can be eaten later (e.g., turn 37).\n\n### Planned Sequence (Turns 30-35)\n1. **Turn 30: Move U** to (2,3). This starts the path toward (2,5) and avoids risks. Direction becomes U.\n2. **Turn 31: Move U** to (2,4). Continues toward (2,5). Direction remains U.\n3. **Turn 32: Move U** to (2,5) and eat the food. Snake length increases to 13. Direction remains U.\n4. **Turn 33: Move R** to (3,5). This avoids moving up to (2,6), which could corner the snake, and instead heads toward (6,4). Direction changes to R.\n5. **Turn 34: Move R** to (4,5). Continues the path east toward (6,4). Direction remains R.\n\n### Reasoning for 5+ Turns Ahead\n- **Turns 30-32**: Eating (2,5) by turn 32 is optimal as it expires soon. The path is safe, with no body or wall risks.\n- **Turns 33-34**: After eating, moving right (R) opens space and avoids the body concentration around (2,1)-(2,4). (3,5) and (4,5) are free, and this sets up a path to (6,4) via (5,5) and (6,5) in later turns.\n- **Beyond turn 34**: \n  - Turn 35: Move R to (5,5) (safe, free cell).\n  - Turn 36: Move R to (6,5) (safe, free cell).\n  - Turn 37: Move D to (6,4) to eat the food (life span 1 at turn 37, still available).\n- **Risks avoided**: \n  - No instant reverse (e.g., no D from U direction).\n  - Body collisions: All moves are to free cells; after eating, body positions are tracked to ensure safety (e.g., on turn 33, (3,5) is free).\n  - Wall/obstacles: All moves stay within x=1-6, y=1-6, avoiding (5,6).\n  - Tail reward danger: No food on tail, so no issue.\n\nThis sequence scores +1 by turn 32, sets up for another +1 by turn 37, and ensures the snake has room to maneuver for long-term survival.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: R\nTurn 34: R\n}",

It's turn 31, and I'm playing Snake on a 8x8 grid since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, meaning the grid goes from (0,0) to (7,7). There's an internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nThe snake positions are: head at (2,3), then body segments at (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), and tail at (4,4). Let me list them in order:\n\n- Head: (2,3)\n\n- Segment 1: (2,2)\n\n- Segment 2: (2,1)\n\n- Segment 3: (3,1)\n\n- Segment 4: (4,1)\n\n- Segment 5: (5,1)\n\n- Segment 6: (6,1)\n\n- Segment 7: (6,2)\n\n- Segment 8: (6,3)\n\n- Segment 9: (5,3)\n\n- Segment 10: (4,3)\n\n- Segment 11: (4,4)  // this should be the tail\n\nThere are 12 segments? Let me count: positions given are from (2,3) to (4,4), that's 12 positions. Indices: 0 to 11, so 12 segments. Snake length is 12.\n\nHead direction is U, which is up. So current movement is upwards.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (2,5) with value 1, life span 4\n\n- (6,4) with value 1, life span 7\n\n- (6,5) with value 1, life span 10\n\nAll food has value +1, so all are positive food. No negative food here.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls at borders, so cells with x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also, obstacle at (5,6).\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- Head: (2,3)\n\n- Body: (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nTail is at (4,4).\n\nFood at:\n\n- (2,5): up from head, since head is at (2,3), moving up would go to (2,4), then (2,5) is food.\n\n- (6,4): which is near the body, let's see, (6,3) and (6,2) are body, (6,4) is above (6,3)\n\n- (6,5): above (6,4)\n\nCurrent head direction is U, so moving up.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n\nCannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is U, so opposite is D. So I cannot move down on this turn.\n\nAlso, no instant reverse, meaning from U, I cannot go D immediately.\n\nSo possible moves: U, L, R. Down is not allowed.\n\nNow, let's check what each move does.\n\nIf I move U (up): from (2,3) to (2,4)\n\nThen, the snake moves: head to (2,4), and body follows: the tail at (4,4) will move away, but since we're moving, the segment at (2,2) goes to (2,3)? Let's think how snake movement works.\n\nWhen snake moves, head goes to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So:\n\n- New head: (2,4) if I move U\n\n- Then body: segment that was at (2,3) becomes the neck or something, but positions: the first body segment moves to where head was, which is (2,3), then (2,2) moves to (2,2)? No.\n\nStandard snake movement:\n\n- Head moves to new cell.\n\n- Each subsequent body segment moves to the cell where the previous segment was.\n\nSo, after move U:\n\n- Head: from (2,3) to (2,4)\n\n- Body segment 1: from (2,2) to where head was, (2,3)\n\n- Body segment 2: from (2,1) to where segment 1 was, (2,2)\n\n- Body segment 3: from (3,1) to where segment 2 was, (2,1)\n\n- Body segment 4: from (4,1) to where segment 3 was, (3,1)\n\n- Body segment 5: from (5,1) to (4,1)\n\n- Body segment 6: from (6,1) to (5,1)\n\n- Body segment 7: from (6,2) to (6,1)\n\n- Body segment 8: from (6,3) to (6,2)\n\n- Body segment 9: from (5,3) to (6,3)\n\n- Body segment 10: from (4,3) to (5,3)\n\n- Body segment 11 (tail): from (4,4) to where segment 10 was, (4,3)\n\nThe tail was at (4,4), which is segment 11. After move, tail moves to (4,3).\n\nNow, food at (2,5). If I move to (2,4), I'm not eating yet. Then next turn, if I move up to (2,5), I can eat the food there.\n\nBut food at (2,5) has life span 4, meaning it disappears after 4 turns including current, so on turn 31,32,33,34 it exists, gone on turn 35.\n\nCurrent turn 31, so after turn 34 it disappears.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current.\n\nSo at turn t, food has life span N, it will disappear after N turns, meaning it can be eaten until turn t + N - 1 or something? Let's clarify.\n\nRule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn t, food has life_span L, it will be gone at the start of turn t + L? Or end of turn?\n\nTypically, it might be that after L turns, it disappears.\n\nBut let's read: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so at turn t, it has countdown L, meaning after this turn, countdown becomes L-1, and when countdown 0, it disappears.\n\nStandard way: at the beginning of turn, if countdown is 1, it can be eaten that turn, then disappears.\n\nBut to be precise: \"Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\" so for food present at turn t with life_span L:\n\n- At turn t, countdown = L\n\n- After turn t, countdown = L-1\n\n- ...\n\n- After turn t + L - 1, countdown = 1\n\n- After turn t + L - 1, during that turn, if snake eats it, fine, then after turn, countdown becomes 0 and disappears.\n\nI think it's safer to assume that food can be eaten on any turn as long as countdown >0, and after the turn countdown decreases, and if it reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nFor this food at (2,5) with life span 4 at turn 31:\n\n- Turn 31: countdown=4, can be eaten\n\n- Turn 32: countdown=3, can be eaten\n\n- Turn 33: countdown=2, can be eaten\n\n- Turn 34: countdown=1, can be eaten\n\n- After turn 34, countdown=0, disappears, so not available on turn 35.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow back to moves.\n\nPossible actions on turn 31: U, L, R (since D not allowed)\n\nLet's evaluate each:\n\n1. Move U to (2,4)\n\n   - Position: (2,4) is empty? Check if wall or body.\n\n     Walls: borders, so x=0,7 y=0,7 are walls. (2,4) is within 1 to 6? x=2, y=4, grid from 0 to 7, so (2,4) is not border, not wall. Internal obstacle at (5,6), not here.\n\n     Body positions: current body cells: (2,2),(2,1),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(5,3),(4,3),(4,4). (2,4) is not in this list, so empty. Head is at (2,3), moving to (2,4), which is free.\n\n     So moving to (2,4) is safe.\n\n     After moving, head at (2,4), body follows as above.\n\n     No food at (2,4), so no eat, snake length same.\n\n     Then on next turn, I can consider moving to (2,5) to eat food, but need to think ahead.\n\n2. Move L to (1,3)\n\n   - (1,3): x=1, y=3, not border, not obstacle. Is it occupied? Body positions: none at (1,3), so free.\n\n     Moving left to (1,3).\n\n     Then head at (1,3), body follows.\n\n     No food there.\n\n3. Move R to (3,3)\n\n   - (3,3): not border, not obstacle. Is it occupied? Current body: (3,1) is there, but (3,1) is below, not (3,3). Positions: (2,3) head, (2,2), (2,1), (3,1) etc. (3,3) not in list, so free.\n\n     But (5,3) and (4,3) are body, but (3,3) is different. So yes, free.\n\n     Move right to (3,3).\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nAlso, there's a risk with tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (4,4). Head at (2,3), not adjacent. Adjacent would be one step away: up, down, left, right.\n\nHead (2,3) to tail (4,4): delta x=2, delta y=1, not adjacent. So no issue now.\n\nFood at (2,5) is close, and I can eat it soon.\n\nBut let's see the grid layout.\n\nList all occupied cells after move or something.\n\nSince I need to plan multiple turns, I should simulate paths.\n\nFirst, the food at (2,5) is tempting, life span 4, so I have until turn 34 to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, food at (6,4) life span 7, until turn 37, and (6,5) life span 10, until turn 40.\n\nNow, snake is long, 12 segments, so space might be tight.\n\nLet me sketch grid:\n\ny=7 top, y=0 bottom, x=0 left, x=7 right. Standard coordinate.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n\nObstacle at (5,6)\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (2,3)\n\nThen down: (2,2), (2,1)\n\nThen right: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\nThen up: (6,2), (6,3)\n\nThen left: (5,3), (4,3)\n\nThen down? (4,4) is tail, from (4,3) to (4,4) up? y increasing up, so (4,3) to (4,4) is up.\n\ny=4 is above y=3.\n\nSo from (4,3) to (4,4), so it was moving up to the tail.\n\nNow, the snake body occupies: let's list cells:\n\n- Row y=1: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\n- Row y=2: (2,2), (6,2)\n\n- Row y=3: (2,3) head, (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)\n\n- Row y=4: (4,4) tail\n\nAlso, food at (2,5), (6,4), (6,5)\n\n(2,5) is above head at (2,3), so (2,4) is empty.\n\n(6,4) is above (6,3), which is a body segment.\n\n(6,5) above that.\n\nNow, possible moves from (2,3): U, L, R.\n\nIf I move U to (2,4), then head at (2,4), and body: the segment at (2,2) moves to (2,3), etc. Tail at (4,4) moves to (4,3).\n\nThen on turn 32, from (2,4), I can move U to (2,5) to eat food.\n\nIf I eat at (2,5), then snake grows, so new tail added, length becomes 13.\n\nAfter eating, when head moves to food, it consumes, and snake grows, so the tail doesn't move that turn.\n\nRule: when eating positive food, length +1, so after moving head to food, the tail stays, so new segment is added at tail position or something.\n\nStandard: when snake eats, head moves to food, and a new segment is added at the tail position, so tail doesn't move, length increases.\n\nIn movement: if not eating, head moves, tail moves, length same.\n\nIf eating, head moves to food, tail doesn't move, new segment added at old tail position.\n\nThen next turn, tail is at old position.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (2,5) on turn 32 from (2,4), and eat, then:\n\n- Head was at (2,4), moves to (2,5)\n\n- Body: segment that was at (2,3) moves to (2,4)? Let's sequence.\n\nTurn 31: move U to (2,4), no eat.\n\nAfter turn 31: head at (2,4), body: (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) and tail was at (4,4) but moved to (4,3)? After move U on turn 31:\n\n- Head to (2,4)\n\n- Body segments: the first body segment moves to where head was, (2,3)\n\n- Then the segment that was at (2,2) moves to (2,2)? No:\n\nPositions after move:\n\n- New head: (2,4)\n\n- New body segment 1: at (2,3)  // old head position\n\n- New body segment 2: at (2,2)  // where segment 1 was\n\n- New body segment 3: at (2,1)  // where segment 2 was\n\n- New body segment 4: at (3,1)  // where segment 3 was\n\n- New body segment 5: at (4,1)  // where segment 4 was\n\n- New body segment 6: at (5,1)  // where segment 5 was\n\n- New body segment 7: at (6,1)  // where segment 6 was\n\n- New body segment 8: at (6,2)  // where segment 7 was\n\n- New body segment 9: at (6,3)  // where segment 8 was\n\n- New body segment 10: at (5,3)  // where segment 9 was\n\n- New body segment 11: at (4,3)  // where segment 10 was\n\n- And the tail: the segment that was at (4,4) moves to where the previous tail segment was, but since it was tail, and no growth, it moves to where the second last segment was.\n\nIn general, when no eat, the tail moves away from its position.\n\nAfter moving to (2,4), the tail is now at (4,3), which was previously occupied by segment 10.\n\nThe cell (4,4) is now empty.\n\nFood at (2,5) is still there.\n\nThen turn 32: from head at (2,4), I can move U to (2,5).\n\n(2,5) has food, so I eat it.\n\nThen, head moves to (2,5), and since I eat, the tail does not move, so the body: the segment that was at (2,3) moves to (2,4)? Let's see:\n\n- Head moves to (2,5)\n\n- Body segments move: segment at (2,3) moves to where head was, (2,4)\n\n- Segment at (2,2) moves to (2,3)\n\n- Segment at (2,1) moves to (2,2)\n\n- Segment at (3,1) moves to (2,1)\n\n- And so on, up to segment at (4,3) moves to where it should.\n\n- But since I eat, tail does not move, so the last segment stays, and a new segment is added at the old tail position, so length increases.\n\nAfter eating:\n\n- Head at (2,5)\n\n- Body: all segments move to the position of the previous segment, but since tail doesn't move, the segment that was at (4,3) remains at (4,3), and it is now the second last, with the new tail at (4,3)? No.\n\nPositions before move: head at (2,4), body at (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), ..., up to (4,3) and tail at (4,3)? After turn 31, tail is at (4,3).\n\nAfter turn 31 move U: head at (2,4), body: (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)  // 12 segments, tail at (4,3)\n\nThen on turn 32, move U to (2,5) and eat.\n\nSo head moves to (2,5), food consumed.\n\nThen body: each segment moves to previous position:\n\n- Segment that was at (2,3) moves to (2,4)  // new position of first body segment\n\n- Segment at (2,2) moves to (2,3)\n\n- Segment at (2,1) moves to (2,2)\n\n- Segment at (3,1) moves to (2,1)\n\n- Segment at (4,1) moves to (3,1)\n\n- Segment at (5,1) moves to (4,1)\n\n- Segment at (6,1) moves to (5,1)\n\n- Segment at (6,2) moves to (6,1)\n\n- Segment at (6,3) moves to (6,2)\n\n- Segment at (5,3) moves to (6,3)\n\n- Segment at (4,3) moves to (5,3)  // this was the tail, but it moves to (5,3)\n\nSince I ate, the tail does not move, so the segment that was at (4,3) should stay, but it moves to (5,3), and a new segment is added at the old tail position, which is (4,3).\n\nSo after eating:\n\n- Head at (2,5)\n\n- New body segment 1 at (2,4)  // moved from (2,3)\n\n- New body segment 2 at (2,3)  // from (2,2)\n\n- New body segment 3 at (2,2)  // from (2,1)\n\n- New body segment 4 at (2,1)  // from (3,1)\n\n- New body segment 5 at (3,1)  // from (4,1)\n\n- New body segment 6 at (4,1)  // from (5,1)\n\n- New body segment 7 at (5,1)  // from (6,1)\n\n- New body segment 8 at (6,1)  // from (6,2)\n\n- New body segment 9 at (6,2)  // from (6,3)\n\n- New body segment 10 at (6,3)  // from (5,3)\n\n- New body segment 11 at (5,3)  // from (4,3)\n\n- And new tail at (4,3)  // added because of growth\n\nSo now snake has 13 segments, tail at (4,3).\n\nThe cell (4,4) is now empty, and (4,3) is tail.\n\nBut (4,3) was occupied before, but now it's tail.\n\nAnyway, eating (2,5) seems possible and safe.\n\nBut is it risky? I need to think long-term.\n\nAfter eating, head is at (2,5), and I have to move from there.\n\nPossible directions: from (2,5), I can go U, D, L, R, but walls: y=7 is top, so U to (2,6) is possible, y=6<7, so ok. D to (2,4), L to (1,5), R to (3,5).\n\nBut after eating, the body is below, so moving down to (2,4) might be body, but after move, (2,4) has a body segment, so I cannot move there.\n\nAfter eating, positions: head at (2,5), body at (2,4), (2,3), etc.\n\nSo from (2,5), moving D to (2,4) would hit body, collision.\n\nSimilarly, moving L or R or U.\n\nU to (2,6) should be free, L to (1,5) free, R to (3,5) free.\n\nBut moving down to (2,4) is impossible, occupied.\n\nSo from (2,5), possible moves: U, L, R.\n\nNow, the grid has walls at top y=7, so (2,6) is ok, (2,7) is wall.\n\nBut I need to survive.\n\nThere is food at (6,4) and (6,5), but they are on the right.\n\nNow, another option: if I don't go for (2,5) immediately, I might go elsewhere.\n\nBut (2,5) has short life, only 4 turns, so if I don't eat it soon, it disappears.\n\nTurn 31 to 34, so I can eat on turn 32 as above.\n\nBut let's see other moves on turn 31.\n\nIf I move L to (1,3) on turn 31.\n\nThen head to (1,3), which is left.\n\n(1,3) is free, not wall, not body.\n\nThen body follows: head to (1,3), body: segment at (2,2) moves to (2,3)? Positions:\n\nAfter move L: head to (1,3)\n\nBody: segment that was at (2,2) moves to old head (2,3)\n\nSegment at (2,1) moves to (2,2)\n\nSegment at (3,1) moves to (2,1)\n\n Etc., similar to before, tail moves to (4,3) from (4,4).\n\nThen from (1,3), I can move U, D, L, R.\n\nBut current direction after move is L, so next turn cannot move R (opposite).\n\nFrom (1,3), move U to (1,4), L to (0,3) but x=0 is wall, cannot, so L not possible. D to (1,2), R to (2,3) but (2,3) is now body, occupied after move, so cannot.\n\nAfter move to (1,3), positions: head at (1,3), body at (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), ..., (4,3) tail.\n\nSo from (1,3), adjacent cells:\n\n- U: (1,4) - should be free\n\n- D: (1,2) - should be free\n\n- L: (0,3) - wall, cannot\n\n- R: (2,3) - occupied by body, cannot\n\nSo possible moves: U or D.\n\nIf I move U to (1,4), or D to (1,2).\n\nBut (1,2) might be free, but let's see.\n\nThis seems less promising because I'm going left, away from the food at (2,5).\n\nSimilarly, if I move R on turn 31 to (3,3).\n\nThen head to (3,3), which is free.\n\nBody: segment at (2,2) moves to (2,3), etc.\n\nPositions after move R: head at (3,3), body at (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) tail at (4,3) after move.\n\nThen from (3,3), I can move U, D, L, R.\n\nBut current direction R, so cannot move L next.\n\nCells:\n\n- U: (3,4) - free?\n\n- D: (3,2) - free? (3,2) not occupied, probably free.\n\n- L: (2,3) - occupied by body\n\n- R: (4,3) - occupied by body, since tail is at (4,3) but after move, it's occupied.\n\nAfter move, (2,3) has body, (4,3) has body.\n\nSo from (3,3), possible moves: U to (3,4) or D to (3,2).\n\nL and R blocked.\n\nNow, (3,4) might be free, or (3,2).\n\nBut food is at (2,5) which is up-left, or (6,4) right.\n\nTo reach (2,5) from here, it's not direct.\n\nFor example, from (3,3), if I go U to (3,4), then I can go L to (2,4) or R to (4,4), etc.\n\nBut (2,4) might be free at that time.\n\nBut it's getting complicated.\n\nPerhaps going for the food at (2,5) is the best immediate action, but I need to think long-term survival.\n\nAfter eating (2,5), head at (2,5), and I have to maneuever.\n\nThe snake body is mostly on the bottom and right, so the top-left is relatively free.\n\nFrom (2,5), after eating, I can move U to (2,6), for example.\n\n(2,6) is free, not wall, not body.\n\nThen from there, I can go to other areas.\n\nBut there is an obstacle at (5,6), and food at (6,4) and (6,5).\n\n(6,4) and (6,5) are near the body.\n\n(6,3) is a body segment, (6,4) is food above it.\n\nBut to eat (6,4), I need to move head there when it's free.\n\nCurrently, (6,3) is body, so if the body moves away, and head comes.\n\nFor example, after some moves, the snake might move, freeing up (6,4) if the body leaves.\n\nBut it's occupied now.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) is also food.\n\nLife span of (6,4) is 7, so until turn 37, (6,5) until turn 40.\n\nNow, tail reward danger: if head adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it causes collision.\n\nBut currently no food on tail.\n\nTail is at (4,4), no food there.\n\nFood is at (2,5), (6,4), (6,5), not on tail.\n\nBut after moves, it might be.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (5,6), which is top-right.\n\nNow, let's consider the path to the other food.\n\nPerhaps I should avoid going up to (2,5) because it might lead to a dead end or something.\n\nFrom (2,5), I can go left or right or up.\n\ny=6 is row below top, so (2,6) is free, then (2,7) wall, so from (2,6) I can only go L, R, D, not U.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (1,5) or (3,5).\n\nThe bottom area has many body segments, so it might be risky to go down.\n\nFor example, if I go down from (2,5), but I can't immediately because (2,4) is body after eating.\n\nAfter eating at (2,5), (2,4) is body, so I can only go U, L, R from (2,5).\n\nU to (2,6), L to (1,5), R to (3,5).\n\n(1,5) might be free, (3,5) free.\n\nThen from there, I can explore.\n\nBut to reach the food at (6,4), I need to go right and down.\n\nBut the body is there, so I need to wait for it to move.\n\nSince the snake is moving, cells are freed as the tail moves.\n\nFor example, the tail is at (4,3) after eating (2,5), as in my earlier calculation.\n\nThen as I move, the tail moves, freeing cells.\n\nBut the food at (6,4) is currently occupied? No, food is at (6,4), but is there body? Current body at (6,3), (6,2), etc., but (6,4) is food, not body, so it's free but has food.\n\nTo eat it, I need to move head to (6,4) when it's not occupied by body, which it isn't, but I need a path.\n\nThe issue is that (6,4) is adjacent to (6,3) which is body, but as long as I move directly to (6,4) from a free cell, it's ok, but I need to be careful not to collide.\n\nAlso, after eating, I grow, so space decreases.\n\nPerhaps for long-term, it's better to eat the food with shorter life first, but all have value 1, so same reward.\n\nBut (2,5) has short life, so if I don't eat it, I lose it.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) life 7, longer, (6,5) life 10, longer.\n\nSo eating (2,5) soon is good.\n\nBut let's see if there are risks.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (2,5) is at (2,5), and head is at (2,3), moving up to (2,4) then (2,5).\n\nBut is there any danger at (2,5)? No, it's free.\n\nAfter eating, I'm at (2,5), with body below.\n\nI can move to (1,5) or (3,5) or (2,6).\n\n(2,6) is closer to the top, but y=6, I can go left or right along the top.\n\nFor example, from (2,6), I can go L to (1,6), then (0,6) wall, or R to (3,6), (4,6), etc., but there is obstacle at (5,6), so (5,6) is blocked.\n\n(5,6) is obstacle, so I cannot go there.\n\nSo the top row has a gap.\n\ny=6, cells from x=0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 walls, y=6 not wall, but (5,6) obstacle.\n\nSo from (2,6), I can go R to (3,6), (4,6), then to (4,5) or something, but (5,6) blocked, so I can go to (4,6), then down to (4,5) or left/right.\n\n(4,5) might be free.\n\nThen from there, I can reach the right side.\n\nBut the food at (6,4) and (6,5) are below.\n\n(6,4) is at y=4, x=6.\n\nTo eat (6,4), I need to approach from above or below or sides.\n\nBut (6,3) is body, so if I move to (6,4) from (6,5) or from (5,4) or (7,4) but x=7 wall, so only from left or below or above.\n\n(6,5) is above, which is also food.\n\nBut (6,5) has longer life.\n\nPerhaps I can plan to eat both (6,4) and (6,5) later.\n\nBut let's think 5 turns ahead.\n\nTurn 31: I need to decide action.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (2,4) on turn 31.\n\nThen turn 32: move U to (2,5) to eat, length 13.\n\nThen turn 33: from (2,5), move say U to (2,6) for example. (or L or R)\n\nSay I move U to (2,6).\n\nThen head at (2,6), body follows, tail moves.\n\nThen from (2,6), I can move L to (1,6) or R to (3,6).\n\nSay I move R to (3,6) to go towards right.\n\nThen to (4,6), etc.\n\nBut at (4,6), I can move down to (4,5), then to (4,4), etc.\n\nBut (4,4) might be free or not.\n\nAfter previous moves, let's simulate.\n\nTurn 31: move U to (2,4) - no eat\n\nPositions: head (2,4), body: (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) tail\n\nTurn 32: move U to (2,5) - eat, so head to (2,5), body moves: (2,3) to (2,4), (2,2) to (2,3), (2,1) to (2,2), (3,1) to (2,1), (4,1) to (3,1), (5,1) to (4,1), (6,1) to (5,1), (6,2) to (6,1), (6,3) to (6,2), (5,3) to (6,3), (4,3) to (5,3), and new tail at (4,3) since growth.\n\nAfter growth, tail is at (4,3), but it's the new segment.\n\nPositions after turn 32 eat: head (2,5), body: (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)  // 13 segments, tail at (4,3)\n\n(4,3) is tail, and (5,3) is body.\n\nNow turn 33: from (2,5), move U to (2,6)\n\nNo food at (2,6), so head to (2,6), body moves: segment at (2,4) moves to (2,5), etc., tail moves from (4,3) to (5,3)? Let's see:\n\nHead to (2,6)\n\nBody: segment that was at (2,4) moves to old head (2,5)\n\nSegment at (2,3) moves to (2,4)\n\nSegment at (2,2) moves to (2,3)\n\nSegment at (2,1) moves to (2,2)\n\nSegment at (3,1) moves to (2,1)\n\nSegment at (4,1) moves to (3,1)\n\nSegment at (5,1) moves to (4,1)\n\nSegment at (6,1) moves to (5,1)\n\nSegment at (6,2) moves to (6,1)\n\nSegment at (6,3) moves to (6,2)\n\nSegment at (5,3) moves to (6,3)\n\nSegment at (4,3) moves to (5,3)  // tail moves to (5,3)\n\nSo positions: head (2,6), body: (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) tail at (5,3)\n\nNow turn 34: from (2,6), I can move, say, R to (3,6)\n\n(3,6) should be free.\n\nHead to (3,6), body moves: segment at (2,5) to (2,6), segment at (2,4) to (2,5), ..., up to segment at (5,3) to (6,3)? Tail at (5,3) moves to where? Last segment moves to position of previous last, which is (6,3).\n\nPositions before move: head (2,6), body (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) tail\n\nAfter move R to (3,6):\n\nHead to (3,6)\n\nBody: segment at (2,5) moves to (2,6)\n\nSegment at (2,4) moves to (2,5)\n\nSegment at (2,3) moves to (2,4)\n\nSegment at (2,2) moves to (2,3)\n\nSegment at (2,1) moves to (2,2)\n\nSegment at (3,1) moves to (2,1)\n\nSegment at (4,1) moves to (3,1)\n\nSegment at (5,1) moves to (4,1)\n\nSegment at (6,1) moves to (5,1)\n\nSegment at (6,2) moves to (6,1)\n\nSegment at (6,3) moves to (6,2)\n\nSegment at (5,3) moves to (6,3)  // tail moves to (6,3)\n\nSo tail at (6,3)\n\nNow, food at (6,4) is above (6,3), which is now tail? (6,3) is body, tail is at (6,3) after move.\n\n(6,4) is food, adjacent to (6,3).\n\nIf I can move to (6,4) from head at (3,6), it's far.\n\nHead at (3,6), I need to go to (6,4).\n\nFrom (3,6), I can move D to (3,5), for example.\n\nBut let's not plan too far.\n\nThe point is, by moving U on turn 31, I can eat the food at (2,5) on turn 32, and then I have options to move to the top row.\n\nIf I don't go U, for example, if I move R on turn 31 to (3,3).\n\nThen turn 31: move R to (3,3), no eat.\n\nPositions: head (3,3), body: (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) tail at (4,3)\n\nThen from (3,3), I can move U to (3,4) or D to (3,2).\n\nSay move U to (3,4).\n\nThen head to (3,4), body moves, tail to (4,3) or something.\n\nThen I can try to go to (2,4) or (2,5).\n\nBut (2,5) food, life span 4, at turn 31 countdown 4, turn 32 countdown 3, turn 33 countdown 2, etc.\n\nOn turn 32, if I am at (3,4), I can move L to (2,4), then on turn 33 move U to (2,5) to eat, but turn 33 is within life, countdown 2 on turn 33.\n\nTurn 31: food countdown 4\n\nTurn 32: countdown 3\n\nTurn 33: countdown 2\n\nTurn 34: countdown 1\n\nSo on turn 33, I can eat at (2,5).\n\nBut in this case, I eat on turn 33 instead of turn 32.\n\nBut with move U on turn 31, I eat on turn 32, earlier.\n\nAlso, on the way, I might have risks.\n\nFor example, when moving to (3,3), then to (3,4), then to (2,4), all should be free.\n\nBut (2,4) might be occupied? In the first scenario, after turn 31 move U, (2,4) is head, but in this scenario, when I move R on turn 31, (2,4) is free initially.\n\nAt turn 31 start, positions: head (2,3), so (2,4) free.\n\nAfter move R to (3,3), (2,4) still free.\n\nThen turn 32: move U to (3,4), (2,4) still free.\n\nThen turn 33: from (3,4) move L to (2,4), then turn 34 move U to (2,5) to eat.\n\nBut on turn 34, countdown is 1, so I can eat, but it's later.\n\nWhereas with immediate U, I eat on turn 32.\n\nAlso, by turn 34, the food might be riskier, but not really.\n\nBut in terms of score, eating sooner is fine, but since all food +1, eating any time before disappearance is same.\n\nBut for long-term, eating (2,5) early might be better to free up space or something.\n\nAnother risk: the tail reward danger.\n\nSuppose after eating (2,5), and I move around, if the tail has food and head is adjacent, but currently no food on tail.\n\nBut food can spawn under body, but in this state, food is given, no new food mentioned, so only existing food.\n\nThe state has only these three food, no new food spawning, I think; the state is given, so only these food to consider.\n\nSo no new food.\n\nNow, back to turn 31 move.\n\nIf I move L to (1,3), I go left, away from food, and (2,5) might disappear before I can eat it, since I need to go back.\n\nFor example, from (1,3), I can move U to (1,4), then to (1,5), then to (2,5) on turn 34, for example, but turn 34 is possible, but it's tight.\n\nTurn 31: move L to (1,3)\n\nTurn 32: from (1,3) move U to (1,4) (assume)\n\nTurn 33: move U to (1,5)\n\nTurn 34: move R to (2,5) to eat.\n\nOn turn 34, countdown 1, ok.\n\nBut I need to ensure the path is free.\n\nFor example, on turn 34, (2,5) must be free to move to, which it should be.\n\nBut in this case, I eat on turn 34, same as the previous late eat.\n\nWith immediate U, I eat on turn 32.\n\nSo better to eat early to have more time for other things.\n\nMoreover, after eating, I have a longer snake, but I can manage.\n\nNow, the food at (6,4) and (6,5) are on the right.\n\n(6,4) is at (6,4), which is currently free, but to eat it, I need to move head there.\n\nBut the body is around, (6,3) is body, so if I move to (6,4) from above or side.\n\nBut (6,5) is above, so I can eat (6,5) first or (6,4).\n\nBut (6,5) has longer life.\n\nAlso, the obstacle at (5,6) might block access.\n\nFor example, from the top, I can go to (6,6) but (6,6) is not wall? y=6, x=6, not border, but (5,6) obstacle, (6,6) should be free.\n\nx=6, y=6, x=6 is not wall? Walls are x=0 and x=7, so x=6 is not wall, y=6 not wall.\n\nInternal obstacle only at (5,6), so (6,6) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (7,6) is wall, x=7.\n\nSo I can go to (6,6) from (6,5) or something.\n\nBut to eat (6,5), I need to be there.\n\nLet's think about the best long-term path.\n\nPerhaps I should head towards the right to eat the other food.\n\nBut (2,5) is closer and short life, so I should eat it first.\n\nThen after that, go to the right.\n\nFor example, from (2,5) after eating, I can move R to (3,5), then to (4,5), etc.\n\nBut (4,5) might be free.\n\nIn the first scenario, after eating at (2,5) on turn 32, head at (2,5), I can move R to (3,5) on turn 33.\n\nThen from (3,5) move R to (4,5), and so on.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach (6,4) or (6,5).\n\n(6,4) is at y=4, x=6.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can move down to (4,4), but (4,4) might be occupied or not.\n\nAfter turn 32, positions: head (2,5), body (2,4), (2,3), etc., as before.\n\nIf on turn 33 I move R to (3,5), then head to (3,5), body moves: segment at (2,4) to (2,5), segment at (2,3) to (2,4), ..., tail from (4,3) to (5,3) or something.\n\nPositions before turn 33: after turn 32 eat, head (2,5), body (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) tail\n\nTurn 33: move R to (3,5), no food, so head to (3,5), body moves:\n\nSegment at (2,4) moves to (2,5)\n\nSegment at (2,3) moves to (2,4)\n\nSegment at (2,2) moves to (2,3)\n\nSegment at (2,1) moves to (2,2)\n\nSegment at (3,1) moves to (2,1)\n\nSegment at (4,1) moves to (3,1)\n\nSegment at (5,1) moves to (4,1)\n\nSegment at (6,1) moves to (5,1)\n\nSegment at (6,2) moves to (6,1)\n\nSegment at (6,3) moves to (6,2)\n\nSegment at (5,3) moves to (6,3)\n\nSegment at (4,3) moves to (5,3)  // tail moves to (5,3)\n\nSo positions: head (3,5), body (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) tail at (5,3)\n\nNow (6,4) is food, free, but not adjacent to head.\n\nFrom (3,5), I can move D to (3,4) or U to (3,6) or L to (2,5) but (2,5) is body, occupied, so cannot. R to (4,5).\n\n(4,5) should be free.\n\nMove R to (4,5) on turn 34.\n\nThen head to (4,5), body moves, tail to (6,3) or something.\n\nThen from (4,5), I can move D to (4,4) or R to (5,5) or U to (4,6).\n\n(5,5) is free, not obstacle.\n\nThen to (5,5), then I can move R to (6,5) to eat (6,5) food.\n\n(6,5) has food.\n\nOn turn 34 or 35.\n\nTurn 34: from (4,5) move R to (5,5)\n\nThen turn 35: from (5,5) move R to (6,5) to eat.\n\n(6,5) life span 10, countdown at turn 31 is 10, turn 35 is turn 31+4, countdown 10-4=6, still available.\n\nThen eat (6,5), grow.\n\nThen from (6,5), I can move D to (6,4) to eat (6,4) next turn, if possible.\n\n(6,4) is below, and if not occupied.\n\nAfter eating (6,5), head at (6,5), body below.\n\n(6,4) might be body or not.\n\nBut (6,4) is food, so it should be free, but after moves, it might be occupied.\n\nIn this sequence, on turn 35, before moving to (6,5), positions: let's not simulate fully.\n\nThe key point is that by going for (2,5) first, I can still reach the other food later.\n\nIf I don't go for (2,5), I might lose it, and only have two food left.\n\nBut all food is +1, so eating all three is best.\n\n(2,5) is easy to eat with low risk.\n\nNow, what about the tail reward danger for the other food.\n\nFor example, food at (6,4), and if the tail is at (6,3), and head at (6,4), but when I eat (6,4), if tail is at (6,3), which is adjacent, and I eat, then after eating, head at (6,4), and since I grow, new tail added at old tail position, which is (6,3), so head at (6,4) and new tail at (6,3), which are adjacent, but not overlapping, so no collision. Collision only if head touches body, but tail is not body at that moment? After growth, the new tail is at (6,3), and head at (6,4), they are adjacent but not same cell, so no collision.\n\nThe rule: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn this case, if tail cell has food, meaning the cell where tail is has food, and head moves to that cell? No.\n\nLet's read: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake\"\n\n\"the tail cell has positive food\" – so the cell occupied by the tail has food on it.\n\nBut food can be under body, as per rule.\n\n\"Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves on.\"\n\nBut in this case, for the tail cell, if it has food under it, and head is adjacent, then if I move head to the tail cell to eat the food, but when I move head to the tail cell, the tail will have moved or not.\n\nThe danger is: suppose head is adjacent to tail, and the tail cell has food (under it), then if I move head to the tail cell to eat the food, at that moment, the tail moves away, but since I eat, the tail doesn't move, and a new tail is added at the old position, which is where head is now, so head and new tail at same cell, collision.\n\nYes.\n\nIn this state, no food under tail, so no issue.\n\nFor (6,4), it is food, not under body.\n\n(6,4) is a food cell, not occupied by body.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo no tail reward danger now.\n\nTherefore, I think moving U on turn 31 to (2,4) is the best move, to set up eating (2,5) on turn 32.\n\nThen for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the instruction is to output actions starting from turn t1, for several turns, but it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output format is to list actions for turns t1, t1+1, etc., but I don't have to specify all, just the sequence for the current decision.\n\nThe answer format is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn \\(t_1\\): action on turn t_1\nTurn \\(t_1 + 1\\): action on turn t_1 + 1\n...\n}\n\nAnd it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" to prioritize long-term, but I need to output a sequence starting from t1.\n\nBut I don't know how many turns to output; it might be for the immediate actions.\n\nPerhaps I should output the actions for the next few turns based on the plan.\n\nSince it says \"maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks\" and \"think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan a sequence.\n\nBut the food positions might change, but in this case, only existing food.\n\nLife span decreases, so I need to eat before expiration.\n\nFor now, on turn 31, move U to (2,4).\n\nThen on turn 32, move U to (2,5) to eat.\n\nThen on turn 33, from (2,5), I need to move, say U to (2,6) or R to (3,5), etc.\n\nTo go towards the other food, I should move right.\n\nSo on turn 33, move R to (3,5).\n\nThen turn 34, move R to (4,5), and so on.\n\nBut let's define a sequence for 5 turns or so.\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: U (eat at (2,5))\n\nThen turn 33: from (2,5), move R to (3,5)\n\nTurn 34: from (3,5), move R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 35: from (4,5), move to (5,5) or something.\n\n(5,5) is free.\n\nThen to (6,5) to eat.\n\nBut (6,5) can be eaten later.\n\nSince (6,4) has shorter life, life span 7, so at turn 31, countdown 7, turn 38 disappear.\n\nI can eat (6,4) first if possible.\n\nBut from the left, it might be easier to go to (6,5).\n\nI think U on turn 31 is fine.\n\nNow, for the answer, I'll output actions for turn 31 to, say, turn 35 or so.\n\nBut I need to specify the actions.\n\nSince the head direction changes, I need to be careful with no reverse.\n\nAfter turn 32, head at (2,5), direction U (since last move U).\n\nThen on turn 33, I can move R, which is not opposite, so ok.\n\nThen direction R.\n\nThen move R again to (4,5), etc.\n\nNow, to avoid the internal obstacle, I can go around.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n\nPerhaps there is a better move.\n\nAnother option: if I move R on turn 31 to (3,3), then I can go up to (3,4), then to (2,4), then to (2,5) on turn 34, as I thought earlier, but I eat later, and I might not be able to eat both (6,4) and (6,5) easily.\n\nBut with U first, I eat (2,5) early.\n\nI think U is best.\n\nSo for turn 31, action U.\n\nThen for the sequence, I'll plan.\n\nBut in the output, I need to list multiple turns.\n\nLet me define:\n\nTurn 31: U (to (2,4))\n\nTurn 32: U (to (2,5), eat)\n\nThen from (2,5), move R to (3,5) on turn 33.\n\nThen from (3,5), move R to (4,5) on turn 34.\n\nThen from (4,5), move U to (4,6) on turn 35? (4,6) might be free.\n\nThen from (4,6), move R to (5,6) but (5,6) is obstacle, cannot.\n\n(5,6) obstacle, so cannot move there.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can move R to (5,5) on turn 35.\n\nThen from (5,5), move R to (6,5) on turn 36 to eat (6,5).\n\nThen from (6,5), move D to (6,4) on turn 37 to eat (6,4), if life span allows.\n\n(6,4) life span 7, turn 31 countdown 7, turn 37 countdown 1, so can eat on turn 37.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) life span 10, turn 36 countdown 5, ok.\n\nSo this sequence allows eating all three food.\n\nAfter eating (6,4) on turn 37, I can continue.\n\nBut for now, on turn 31, I should move U.\n\nThe answer should include the actions.\n\nBut the user might expect only the immediate action, but the format says to list for turns.\n\nI think I'll output for turns 31 to 35 or so.\n\nIn the box.\n\nFirst, turn 31: U\n\nThen turn 32: U\n\nThen turn 33: R\n\nThen turn 34: R\n\nThen turn 35: R to (5,5) from (4,5), but in turn 34 I am at (4,5), so turn 35 move R to (5,5)\n\nIn sequence:\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: U  // eat at (2,5)\n\nTurn 33: R  // to (3,5)\n\nTurn 34: R  // to (4,5)\n\nTurn 35: R  // to (5,5)\n\nThen later to (6,5)\n\nBut I think for the answer, listing up to turn 35 is fine.\n\nSince the grid might have issues, but I think it's ok.\n\nTo be safe, on turn 33 from (2,5) I could move U to (2,6) to explore, but going right is towards other food.\n\nI think R is fine.\n\nSo for the output.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score and ensure long-term survival, I will think 5+ turns ahead, prioritizing eating available positive food while avoiding collisions and considering the life spans of the food. The current state (turn 31) has three positive food items: (2,5) with life span 4 (disappears after turn 34), (6,4) with life span 7 (disappears after turn 37), and (6,5) with life span 10 (disappears after turn 40). The snake head is at (2,3) with direction U (up), and the possible moves are U, L, or R (down is invalid due to no instant reverse).\n\n### Key Considerations for the Plan:\n- **Immediate Action (Turn 31)**: Move towards (2,5) to eat it before it disappears. Moving up (U) to (2,4) is safe and sets up for eating on turn 32.\n- **Eating (2,5)**: On turn 32, moving up again to (2,5) eats the food, increasing length to 13. This must be done by turn 34, but earlier is better to free up space.\n- **Long-Term Path**: After eating (2,5), head to the right to target (6,5) and (6,4). The path avoids the internal obstacle at (5,6) and leverages the longer life spans of the right-side food.\n- **Risk Avoidance**: \n  - No tail reward danger: The tail is at (4,4), not adjacent to head, and no food is under the tail.\n  - Collision checks: All moves avoid walls, obstacles, and body segments.\n  - Direction constraints: After each move, the new direction is considered to prevent illegal reverses.\n- **Sequence for 5 Turns**: Plan covers turns 31–35, ensuring (2,5) is eaten and the snake positions for future food. Beyond turn 35, the snake can continue to (6,5) for eating around turn 36.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 31 (current)**: Move U to (2,4).  \n  - Why: Sets up to eat (2,5) next turn. (2,4) is safe (empty, no wall/body). Direction becomes U.\n- **Turn 32**: Move U to (2,5) and eat.  \n  - Why: Eats (2,5) before it disappears (life span 4, countdown 1 on turn 32). Length increases to 13. Direction remains U.\n- **Turn 33**: Move R to (3,5).  \n  - Why: Heads right toward (6,5). (3,5) is safe. Direction changes to R (not opposite to U).\n- **Turn 34**: Move R to (4,5).  \n  - Why: Continues path to the right. (4,5) is safe. Direction remains R.\n- **Turn 35**: Move R to (5,5).  \n  - Why: Positions near (6,5) for future eating. (5,5) is safe (not wall/body/obstacle). Direction remains R.\n\n### Next Steps Beyond Turn 35:\n- Turn 36: Move R to (6,5) to eat (life span allows until turn 40).\n- Turn 37: Move D to (6,4) to eat (life span allows until turn 37, countdown 1).\n- This sequence eats all food safely and avoids dead ends. After turn 35, the snake can adapt based on new states.\n\n### Verification:\n- **Turn 31 U**: From (2,3) to (2,4). Valid moves: U allowed (not opposite). Safe: No collision.\n- **Turn 32 U**: From (2,4) to (2,5). Eats food: Yes. Growth: Tail stays, new segment added. Safe.\n- **Turn 33 R**: From (2,5) to (3,5). Valid: R not opposite to U (previous direction). Safe: (3,5) empty.\n- **Turn 34 R**: From (3,5) to (4,5). Valid: R not opposite to R. Safe: (4,5) empty.\n- **Turn 35 R**: From (4,5) to (5,5). Valid: R not opposite. Safe: (5,5) empty, obstacle at (5,6) not affected.\n\nThis plan maximizes score by eating all food, avoids risks, and ensures survival for 5+ turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 31: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 32: U (up) \\\\\nTurn 33: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 34: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 35: R (right)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I'm the AI playing Snake. The goal is to maximize score by eating positive food while avoiding risks. I need to think at least 5 turns ahead and prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nCurrent turn is t1 = 32.\n\nThe grid has walls:\n- Border cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So it's an 8x8 grid from (0,0) to (7,7), with borders being walls.\n- Internal obstacle: (5,6)\n\nSnake positions: head at (2,4), then body: (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3). So the snake has 12 segments. Head is at (2,4) and direction is Up, which makes sense since it's moving from (2,3) to (2,4) – wait no, positions are listed head first, so from head to tail: (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), etc. Since direction is U, and previous position was (2,3), which is below (2,4), so moving up to (2,4). Current head direction is U, so it just moved up to (2,4).\n\nFood:\n- (2,5) with life span 3, value 1 (positive)\n- (6,4) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n- (6,5) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food mentioned. Value is 1 for all, and life span decreases each turn.\n\nLife span: for (2,5), life span 3, meaning it disappears after 3 turns, including current turn? Let me check the rules.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for food at (2,5) with life_span 3 on turn 32: on turn 32, life_span becomes 2; turn 33, it becomes 1; turn 34, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turns 32, 33, or 34, but not after.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) life_span 6: from turn 32 to 37, disappears on turn 38? Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nOn turn t, life_span = L, then:\n- On turn t, it can be eaten, and after movement, life_span decreases to L-1 for the next state.\n- It exists as long as life_span > 0. When life_span reaches 0, it disappears.\n\nFor (2,5): life_span=3 on turn 32. So:\n- Turn 32: life_span=3, can be eaten\n- After turn 32, if not eaten, life_span=2 for turn 33\n- Turn 33: life_span=2, can be eaten\n- After turn 33, if not eaten, life_span=1 for turn 34\n- Turn 34: life_span=1, can be eaten\n- After turn 34, if not eaten, life_span=0, disappears, not available on turn 35.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, snake head at (2,4), direction U. Possible moves: U, D, L, R, but with constraints.\n\nMovement constraints: Cannot move opposite to current direction immediately. Current direction is U, so cannot move D (down) next, because that would be reverse.\n\nAllowed moves: U (up), L (left), R (right). D is not allowed because it's opposite to U.\n\nAlso, need to avoid collisions: walls and body.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid.\n\nGrid size: from (0,0) to (7,7). Walls at borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also internal wall at (5,6).\n\nSnake positions:\nHead: (2,4)\nBody: (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)\n\nList all occupied cells by snake:\n- (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)\n\nNow, food:\n- (2,5): this is directly above head, since head at (2,4), so (2,5) is one cell up.\n- (6,4): which is right of (6,3) and below (6,5)? (6,4) is at x=6,y=4.\n- (6,5) at x=6,y=5.\n\n(6,4) and (6,5) are both at x=6, y=4 and y=5.\n\nSnake has a segment at (6,3), which is tail or body? Positions: head (2,4), then to tail: (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), then (5,3), (4,3). So tail is (4,3).\n\n(6,3) is a body segment, not tail.\n\nNow, possible moves from head (2,4):\n\n- Up (U): to (2,5). But (2,5) has food with value 1. But we need to check if it's safe.\n\n- Down (D): but cannot, because opposite direction. Current direction U, so D is not allowed.\n\n- Left (L): to (1,4). Is this within bounds? x=1, y=4. Borders are x=0 and x=7, y=0 and y=7, so (1,4) should be free, but need to check walls and obstacles.\n\nWalls: borders x=0,7 y=0,7, and internal (5,6). (1,4) is not a wall, so it might be free, but could be occupied by snake or food?\n\nSnake positions: let's list all snake cells to avoid.\n\nSnake: (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)\n\n(1,4) is not in this list, and no food there, so it should be empty.\n\n- Right (R): to (3,4). (3,4) not in snake positions, no wall, no food mentioned, so empty.\n\nNow, (2,5) has food, so moving U would eat it.\n\nBut we have to consider the rules about food under body or tail danger.\n\nFirst, (2,5) is not under snake body, because snake is at (2,4), (2,3), etc., but (2,5) is above, not occupied by snake currently.\n\nSnake is at (2,4) head, then (2,3), so (2,5) is free.\n\nAlso, tail is at (4,3), not adjacent to head.\n\nHead at (2,4), tail at (4,3), which is not adjacent; adjacent would be same row or column, one cell away.\n\n(2,4) to (4,3): delta x=2, delta y=-1, not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing edge, so |dx| + |dy| =1.\n\nSo (2,4) adjacent cells: (2,5) U, (2,3) D but occupied, (1,4) L, (3,4) R.\n\n(2,3) is occupied by body, so moving D not allowed and also occupied.\n\nBut tail is at (4,3), far away.\n\nNow, about (2,5): if I move U to (2,5), I eat the food, snake grows, so new head at (2,5), and tail stays, but since I eat, length increases, so new tail will be added after moving.\n\nStandard snake: when you eat, the head moves to food, food is consumed, and a new segment is added at the tail, so tail doesn't move that turn.\n\nBut in terms of position after move.\n\nIf I move to (2,5), I eat food, so snake becomes: head at (2,5), then previous head (2,4) becomes body, and so on, with tail still at (4,3), but since I ate, after movement, the tail doesn't move, so the new positions: from head to tail: (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) and then a new segment is added where the tail was? No.\n\nIn snake, when you eat, the head moves to the food cell, the food is removed, and the tail does not move, so the snake grows by one segment. So the new tail position is the same as the old tail, because it didn't move.\n\nPositions: before move, snake is S = [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nAfter moving without eating: new head at new position, new body starts from old head, and tail is removed, so new snake [new_head, H, B1, ..., B_{n-1}] where B_{n-1} was the segment before tail.\n\nAfter moving and eating: new head at food position, new body starts from old head, and tail remains, so new snake [new_head, H, B1, B2, ..., T] with one more segment.\n\nIn this case, if I move U to (2,5), which has food, I eat it, so new snake: head (2,5), then (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) and since I ate, I add a new segment at the end, so tail becomes new position? No.\n\nThe tail doesn't move when you eat. So the segment that was tail remains, and a new segment is added after it? I think I'm confusing.\n\nStandard: when snake moves without eating, the head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the next position, tail is removed from its cell.\n\nWhen eating, head moves to food, body segments move as usual, but tail does not move, so the cell that was tail is still occupied, and a new segment is effectively added there.\n\nSo positions: after eating, the snake has all previous segments plus one new at the tail position.\n\nFor example, before move: positions P0, P1, P2, ..., Pk where P0 head, Pk tail.\n\nAfter moving to food: new head at food position, say F, then new body: P0 (old head), P1, P2, ..., Pk (old tail), and since eating, Pk remains as the last segment, so new snake [F, P0, P1, ..., Pk] with k+2 segments? No.\n\nNumber of segments: originally, say n segments.\n\nAfter move without eating: head moves to new position, body segments shift, so tail position is removed, still n segments.\n\nAfter move with eating: head moves to food, body segments shift, but tail does not move, so the tail segment stays, and we add a new segment at the tail position? No.\n\nI think it's: the tail cell is not vacated, so the snake gains one cell.\n\nPositions: let S be the list [H, B1, B2, ..., T] with len L.\n\nAfter moving to a free cell: new head at new_pos, new body [H, B1, B2, ..., B_{L-2}], and tail is gone, so new list [new_pos, H, B1, ..., B_{L-2}], length L.\n\nAfter moving to food: new head at food_pos, new body [H, B1, B2, ..., T], and since eating, T remains, so new list [food_pos, H, B1, B2, ..., T], length L+1.\n\nIn this case, T is included, so the tail position is the same.\n\nFor example, here, before: positions: (2,4)H, (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)T\n\nIf I move U to (2,5) which has food, after move: head at (2,5), then body: (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) and since ate, tail (4,3) stays, so new tail is still (4,3), and length is 13 now.\n\nPositions: [ (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) ] same as before but with (2,5) added at head, and tail (4,3) remains.\n\nLength increases by one.\n\nNow, back to the move.\n\nIf I move U to (2,5), I eat the food, get +1 score, and snake grows.\n\nBut is it safe? After moving, head at (2,5), body at (2,4), which is directly below, so no immediate collision.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, there's a rule about \"Tail Reward Danger\": if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut in this case, tail is at (4,3), not adjacent to head (2,4), so no issue.\n\nHead at (2,4), tail at (4,3), not adjacent.\n\nSo moving U to eat (2,5) seems possible.\n\nBut life span of (2,5) is 3, so it will disappear after turn 34, so I have until turn 34 to eat it, but on turn 32, I can eat it now.\n\nSimilarly, other food.\n\nBut I need to think multiple turns ahead.\n\nAlso, possible moves: U, L, or R.\n\nU: to (2,5) with food.\n\nL: to (1,4), empty.\n\nR: to (3,4), empty.\n\nD not allowed.\n\nNow, let's think about the grid and snake path.\n\nThe snake is currently going up at (2,4), but above at (2,5) is food, which is good.\n\nBut the snake body is below and to the right.\n\nAlso, there's food at (6,4) and (6,5).\n\n(6,4) is at x=6,y=4, which is on the right column.\n\nSnake has segments at (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), and (5,3), etc.\n\n(6,4) is free, but (6,3) is snake body, so (6,4) is adjacent to snake body? (6,3) is a body segment.\n\nBut (6,4) has food, so if I go there, I can eat.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) has food.\n\nBut to reach (6,4), I need to move right multiple times.\n\nFrom (2,4), if I go R to (3,4), then I can continue.\n\nBut let's plan a path.\n\nFirst, I need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nAlso, consider the walls and obstacles.\n\nInternal wall at (5,6), which is near (6,5) food.\n\n(5,6) is a wall, so cannot go there.\n\nNow, let's list all free cells or something.\n\nPerhaps I should simulate the next few turns.\n\nBut I need to choose actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe output should be actions for turn 32, 33, 34, etc., but at least 5 turns, so up to turn 37 or more.\n\nBut since food life span, (2,5) must be eaten by turn 34.\n\nTurn 32: life_span=3, can be eaten on 32,33,34.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) life_span=6, so until turn 37 (since turn 32:6, 33:5, 34:4, 35:3, 36:2, 37:1, 38:0 gone).\n\nTurn 32: L=6, can be eaten on 32 to 37.\n\nTurn 37: L=1, eaten or gone on 38.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) L=9, so many turns.\n\nNow, priorities: (2,5) is close and will disappear soon, so I should eat it soon to not miss it.\n\nBut is it risky?\n\nIf I eat (2,5), head at (2,5), then I can go U, L, R, but not D (since direction would be U, so no D).\n\nAfter moving U to (2,5), direction is U, so on next turn, cannot move D.\n\nPossible moves from (2,5):\n- U to (2,6)\n- L to (1,5)\n- R to (3,5)\n- D to (2,4) but (2,4) is now body, occupied, and also D is opposite to U, not allowed.\n\n(2,4) is body, so cannot move there.\n\nSo only U, L, R.\n\nNow, (2,6): is it wall? y=6, border y=7 is wall, y=6 is not border, but y=7 is wall, so (2,6) is within bounds, not wall.\n\nIs it occupied? Snake: after eating (2,5), positions include (2,4) body, so (2,6) is free, no food, so empty.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) and (3,5) should be free.\n\n(3,5): not in snake, no wall, no food.\n\nFood is at (6,4) and (6,5), not here.\n\nSo from (2,5), I can go U, L, or R.\n\nIf I go U to (2,6), then I am near top border, y=7 is wall, so y=6, I can only go L or R, not U to (2,7) which is wall.\n\n(2,7) is border, wall, cannot go.\n\nSo from (2,6), if I go U, invalid.\n\nBut let's not get ahead.\n\nFirst, for turn 32, I need to decide action.\n\nOption 1: Move U to (2,5) to eat food.\n\nPros: get +1 score now, food will disappear soon.\n\nCons: might lead to dead end or something.\n\nBut let's see the area.\n\nThe snake is long, 12 segments, and it's coiled, with body at bottom and right.\n\nFrom (2,4), if I go U to (2,5), then I am at (2,5), with body below at (2,4), (2,3), etc.\n\nThen I need to go somewhere.\n\nI could go left or right to explore.\n\nBut there's food at (6,4) and (6,5), which are on the right.\n\n(6,4) is at same y as current head, but x=6.\n\nFrom (2,4) to (6,4) is 4 cells right, but there might be obstacles.\n\nCells: (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4).\n\n(3,4) is free, (4,4) free, (5,4) free, (6,4) has food.\n\nBut (5,4) is below the wall at (5,6), but (5,4) is free.\n\nInternal wall at (5,6), which is above.\n\nAlso, snake body: for example, (4,3) is tail, (5,3) body, etc.\n\n(4,4) is free, (5,4) free.\n\n(6,4) has food.\n\nIf I want to eat (6,4), I can go right multiple times.\n\nFrom (2,4), if I go R to (3,4), then on next turn, from (3,4), direction R, so can go R to (4,4), then R to (5,4), then R to (6,4) to eat.\n\nBut when I reach (6,4), I eat the food.\n\nBut life span of (6,4) is 6, so I have time.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) is above, but (6,4) first.\n\nBut if I go for (2,5) now, I might miss the direct path to (6,4), but I can still go later.\n\n(2,5) is only available for 3 turns, so if I don't eat it now, I might not get it.\n\nIf I go right to (3,4) on turn 32, then on turn 33, I can go to (4,4), turn 34 to (5,4), turn 35 to (6,4) to eat.\n\nBut on turn 34, (2,5) disappears? Let's see turns.\n\nTurn 32: t=32\n\n(2,5) life_span=3, so can be eaten on turn 32,33, or 34. After turn 34, gone.\n\nIf I don't eat on turn 32, and I go right, on turn 32 I move to (3,4), not eating (2,5).\n\nThen turn 33: I am at (3,4), direction R (if I moved R).\n\nFrom (3,4), I can move U, D, L, R, but not opposite, which would be L, since direction R, so cannot move L to (2,4).\n\nPossible moves: U to (3,5), D to (3,3), R to (4,4), L not allowed.\n\n(2,5) is at (2,5), which is adjacent to (3,4)? (3,4) to (2,5) is not adjacent; adjacent are (3,5) U, (3,3) D, (2,4) L, (4,4) R.\n\n(2,5) is not directly accessible from (3,4); it's diagonal.\n\nTo reach (2,5) from (3,4), I need to go to (2,4) or (2,5) directly, but (2,4) is now occupied by snake body.\n\nAfter turn 32, if I moved to (3,4), the snake positions: head at (3,4), then body: (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), and tail (4,3) but since no eat, tail moves? Let's clarify.\n\nOn turn 32, if I move R to (3,4), no food there, so snake moves: new head at (3,4), new body starts from old head (2,4), then (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), and the old tail (4,3) is removed, so new tail is (5,3) or something.\n\nPositions before move: [ (2,4)H, (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)T ]\n\nMove R to (3,4), empty, no eat, so new head at (3,4), new body: [ (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) ] and tail (4,3) is removed, so new snake: [ (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) ] with 12 segments, tail at (5,3).\n\n(4,3) is gone, tail is now (5,3).\n\n(5,3) was body, now tail.\n\nSo positions: head (3,4), then (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)T\n\n(6,3) is still there, then (5,3) tail.\n\nNow, (2,5) is still there, but to eat it, I need to move to (2,5).\n\nFrom current head (3,4), (2,5) is not adjacent; adjacent are (3,5), (3,3), (2,4), (4,4).\n\n(2,4) is body, occupied, so I cannot move to (2,4).\n\n(2,5) is at (2,5), which is not adjacent to (3,4), so I cannot move directly to (2,5) from (3,4).\n\nTo reach (2,5), I would need to go to (2,4) first, but (2,4) is occupied, or go to (1,4) or (1,5), etc., which might not be efficient.\n\nFor example, from (3,4), I could go U to (3,5), then L to (2,5), but on turn 33, from (3,4), I can go U to (3,5), assuming it's free.\n\n(3,5) is free, no issue.\n\nThen on turn 34, from (3,5), I can go L to (2,5) to eat, if (2,5) still exists.\n\nTurn 34 is the last turn for (2,5), since after turn 34 it disappears.\n\nOn turn 33, if I am at (3,4), and I go U to (3,5), then on turn 34, I can go L to (2,5) to eat.\n\nBut on turn 34, (2,5) has life_span=1, can be eaten.\n\nIf on turn 33 I go somewhere else, I might miss it.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nFirst, back to turn 32.\n\nIf on turn 32 I move R to (3,4), then on turn 33 I can move U to (3,5), then on turn 34 move L to (2,5) to eat.\n\nBut when I move to (2,5) on turn 34, I eat it.\n\nIf on turn 32 I move U to (2,5) directly, I eat it on turn 32.\n\nSo both ways I can eat (2,5), but one is earlier.\n\nNow, if I eat on turn 32, I have the score now, and snake is longer.\n\nIf I eat on turn 34, same score, but later.\n\nBut in terms of survival, eating earlier might be better to have more space or something.\n\nBut let's see the other food.\n\nThere's food at (6,4) and (6,5).\n\nIf I go for (2,5) first, I am at (2,5) or (2,6) after, which is top-left, while the other food is bottom-right.\n\nFrom there, I need to go right and down to reach (6,4).\n\nFor example, from (2,5) after eating, head at (2,5), I can go R to (3,5), then R to (4,5), etc.\n\nBut there's an internal wall at (5,6), so (5,5), (5,4) might be affected.\n\n(5,6) is wall, so (5,5) is free, etc.\n\nAlso, snake body is below.\n\nAnother thing: the tail is at (4,3) or moving.\n\nBut tail will move as snake moves.\n\nLet's consider the risk.\n\nIf I move U to (2,5) on turn 32, I eat, head at (2,5), direction U.\n\nThen turn 33: from (2,5), I can go U, L, or R.\n\nIf I go U to (2,6), then I am at (2,6), near top wall.\n\nThen from (2,6), I can go L to (1,6) or R to (3,6), not D (opposite).\n\nBut going U to (2,7) is wall, impossible.\n\nSo I have to go left or right.\n\nIf I go left to (1,6), then I might be cornered.\n\nSimilarly, if I go right to (3,6), etc.\n\nBut I can go R to (3,5) from (2,5) on turn 33.\n\nLet's plan to go for the other food.\n\nSince (2,5) is urgent, I should eat it soon.\n\nOn turn 32, move U to (2,5) to eat.\n\nThen turn 33: from (2,5), I move R to (3,5) to start heading right.\n\nThen turn 34: from (3,5), direction R, so can go U, D, R, not L.\n\nPossible: U to (3,6), D to (3,4), R to (4,5).\n\n(3,4) might be occupied or not.\n\nAfter turn 32: ate at (2,5), so snake: head (2,5), body (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)T, and new segment, so positions: [ (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) ] with 13 segments, tail at (4,3).\n\nOn turn 33, move R to (3,5), which is empty, no food, so snake moves: new head at (3,5), new body: [ (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) ] and tail (4,3) removed, so new snake: [ (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) ] tail at (5,3).\n\n(4,3) is gone.\n\nNow head at (3,5), direction R.\n\nTurn 34: from (3,5), can move U, D, R (not L).\n\nU to (3,6), D to (3,4), R to (4,5).\n\n(3,4) is free? Let's see, in the snake positions above, (3,4) is not listed, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,5) free, (3,6) free.\n\nI can go R to (4,5) to continue right.\n\nOr D to (3,4) to go down.\n\nBut I want to go to (6,4), so going R to (4,5) is better.\n\n(6,4) is at y=4, so I need to go down eventually.\n\nBut (4,5) is at y=5.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can go D to (4,4) or R to (5,5), etc.\n\nBut let's see the food at (6,4) and (6,5).\n\n(6,5) is at y=5, so if I go to (4,5), then to (5,5), then to (6,5) to eat (6,5).\n\n(6,5) has life span 9, so plenty of time.\n\n(6,4) at y=4.\n\nBut there's also the internal wall at (5,6), which is above, so for y=5 and y=6.\n\n(5,6) is wall, so (5,5) is below it.\n\nNow, another option: on turn 32, I move L to (1,4) instead.\n\nBut (1,4) is left, away from the food, and (2,5) might be missed.\n\nIf I move L to (1,4) on turn 32, then I am at (1,4), direction L.\n\nThen turn 33: from (1,4), can move U, D, L (not R).\n\nL to (0,4) but x=0 is wall, cannot move to wall, so invalid.\n\nU to (1,5), D to (1,3), or R but not allowed.\n\nR is opposite to L, not allowed.\n\nSo only U or D.\n\nIf U to (1,5), then from there, etc., but (2,5) is at (2,5), which is adjacent to (1,5)? (1,5) to (2,5) is adjacent, right.\n\nBut on turn 33, if I am at (1,5), I can go R to (2,5) to eat on turn 33.\n\nTurn 32: move L to (1,4), no eat, so snake moves: new head (1,4), body: (2,4), (2,3), etc., tail removed, so (4,3) gone, new tail (5,3) or something.\n\nPositions: before turn 32 move: [ (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) ]\n\nMove L to (1,4), empty, no eat, new head (1,4), new body [ (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) ] and tail (4,3) removed, so new snake: [ (1,4), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) ] tail (5,3).\n\n(5,3) is tail.\n\nNow head at (1,4), direction L.\n\nTurn 33: move U to (1,5), for example, empty.\n\nThen head at (1,5), direction U.\n\nThen turn 34: from (1,5), can move U to (1,6), L to (0,5) wall, R to (2,5), D not allowed.\n\nSo can move U or R.\n\nIf move R to (2,5), which has food, eat it.\n\nBut on turn 34, (2,5) life_span=1, can be eaten.\n\nSo I can eat it on turn 34.\n\nBut I had to go left and up, which might not be efficient.\n\nAnd snake is at (1,5), which is corner, x=1,y=5, near left wall.\n\nThen after eating (2,5), I need to go back, etc.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nSo better to eat (2,5) directly on turn 32 or via the right move.\n\nThe safest and most direct is to eat on turn 32 by moving U.\n\nThen I can head right.\n\nNow, about the other food.\n\n(6,4) and (6,5) are both at x=6.\n\n(6,4) life_span=6, so can be eaten until turn 37.\n\n(6,5) life_span=9, longer.\n\nBut (6,4) might be easier to reach first.\n\nAlso, note that (6,3) is a body segment, but when snake moves, it might vacate.\n\nCurrently, snake has segment at (6,3).\n\nIn the positions, (6,3) is occupied.\n\nIf I move, it might move away.\n\nFor example, if I go right from current position.\n\nOn turn 32, if I move U to (2,5), eat.\n\nThen turn 33, move R to (3,5).\n\nThen turn 34, from (3,5), I can move R to (4,5).\n\nThen turn 35, from (4,5), direction R, can move U, D, R.\n\nU to (4,6), D to (4,4), R to (5,5).\n\nI can go D to (4,4) to go down to y=4.\n\nThen from (4,4), go R to (5,4), then R to (6,4) to eat on turn 36 or 37.\n\nLet's count turns.\n\nTurn 32: U to (2,5) eat\n\nTurn 33: R to (3,5)\n\nTurn 34: R to (4,5)\n\nNow from (4,5), on turn 35, I can move D to (4,4)\n\nThen turn 36: from (4,4), direction D? After moving to (4,4) from (4,5), direction down, so can move U, D, L, R but not opposite, which would be U.\n\nDirection: from (4,5) to (4,4) is down, so direction D.\n\nThen on turn 36, from (4,4), can move D to (4,3), L to (3,4), R to (5,4), not U.\n\nNow, (4,3) might be occupied? Let's see positions.\n\nAfter turn 34: head at (4,5), but let's track.\n\nAfter turn 32: snake [ (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3) ] 13 seg, tail (4,3)\n\nTurn 33: move R to (3,5), no food, so new head (3,5), body [ (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) ] tail (4,3) removed, so new snake [ (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) ] tail (5,3)\n\n(5,3) tail.\n\nTurn 34: move R to (4,5), no food, new head (4,5), body [ (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) ] tail (5,3) removed? Body from old: [ (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), ..., up to (6,3) ], but old snake had 13 seg, after move no eat, so 12 seg.\n\nOld positions: [ (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) ]\n\nMove to (4,5), new head (4,5), new body [ (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) ] and tail (5,3) removed, so new snake: [ (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) ] tail (6,3)\n\n(6,3) is tail.\n\nNow turn 35: from (4,5), I want to go to (4,4) or something.\n\nMove D to (4,4), for example.\n\n(4,4) should be free.\n\nNew head (4,4), direction D.\n\nBody [ (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), ... up to (6,2) ], tail (6,3) removed? After move, new positions: [ (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) ] and tail (6,3) removed, so new tail (6,2)\n\nThen turn 36: from (4,4), direction D, so can move L, R, D (not U).\n\nMove R to (5,4)\n\n(5,4) free.\n\nThen new head (5,4), body [ (4,4), (4,5), ... ], etc.\n\nThen turn 37: from (5,4), can move R to (6,4) to eat food at (6,4), if still there.\n\n(6,4) life_span: on turn 32:6, 33:5, 34:4, 35:3, 36:2, 37:1, so on turn 37, life_span=1, can be eaten.\n\nSo I can eat on turn 37.\n\nSimilarly, if I go directly to (6,4) earlier.\n\nBut in this path, I ate (2,5) on turn 32, and heading to (6,4).\n\nNow, what about (6,5)? I can eat that later.\n\nBut there might be a risk with the internal wall.\n\nAnother thing: when I reach (6,4), the head is at (6,4), and (6,5) is above, but (5,6) is wall, so I can go U to (6,5) to eat if I want.\n\nBut life_span long.\n\nNow, back to turn 32 decision.\n\nIf I don't eat (2,5) on turn 32, and go directly to (6,4).\n\nFor example, turn 32: move R to (3,4)\n\nThen turn 33: move R to (4,4)\n\nTurn 34: move R to (5,4)\n\nTurn 35: move R to (6,4) eat.\n\nOn turn 35, (6,4) life_span: start 6 on 32, 33:5, 34:4, 35:3, so can eat on turn 35.\n\nBut (2,5) disappears after turn 34, so on turn 34, if I am at (5,4), I can't eat (2,5), so I miss it.\n\nBy going directly right, I miss the (2,5) food.\n\nIf I go to eat (2,5) on turn 34 as earlier, but I have to detour.\n\nIn terms of score, if I miss (2,5), I lose one point.\n\nSince all food is +1, I should try to eat all if possible.\n\nBut survival first.\n\nNow, eating (2,5) might not be risky, so I should eat it.\n\nMoreover, in the first plan, I can eat both.\n\nNow, another consideration: the \"Tail Reward Danger\".\n\nBut in this case, no issue.\n\nAlso, food under body: but (2,5) is not under body.\n\nNow, let's think about the grid space.\n\nThe snake is 12 segments, grid 8x8, but with walls and obstacles, free cells: total cells 64, walls: borders minus corners? Borders: x=0 or 7, y=0 or 7, so top and bottom rows, left and right columns, but corners shared.\n\nNumber of wall cells: top row y=7: 8 cells, bottom y=0: 8 cells, left x=0, y=1 to 6: 6 cells, right x=7, y=1 to 6: 6 cells, but corners (0,0),(0,7),(7,0),(7,7) included in rows, so total border walls: 8*2 + 6*2 = 16 + 12 = 28? Let's calculate.\n\nGrid 8x8 = 64 cells.\n\nBorder walls: all cells with x=0 or x=7 or y=0 or y=7.\n\nNumber: for x=0, y=0 to 7: 8 cells\n\nx=7, y=0 to 7: 8 cells\n\ny=0, x=1 to 6: 6 cells (since x=0,y=0 and x=7,y=0 already counted)\n\nSimilarly, y=7, x=1 to 6: 6 cells\n\nSo total border walls: 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28 cells.\n\nInternal obstacle: (5,6), so 1 cell.\n\nTotal wall cells: 29.\n\nFree cells: 64 - 29 = 35.\n\nSnake occupies 12 cells, so free space: 35 - 12 = 23 cells, but food is on free cells, so free space minus food.\n\nFood: 3 cells, so empty free cells: 20.\n\nBut as snake moves, it vacates cells.\n\nWith 12 segments, moving, it can be tight, but should be ok if I don't trap myself.\n\nNow, in the current position, if I go up to (2,5), I am near the top, and the body is below, so I might have space to manuever.\n\nIf I go right, I am moving towards the other food.\n\nBut since (2,5) is time-sensitive, I think eating it on turn 32 is best.\n\nThen I can plan to go to (6,4).\n\nNow for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe format is to output actions for turn 32, 33, 34, etc., at least 5 turns.\n\nSo let's define a sequence.\n\nTurn 32: move U to (2,5) to eat food.\n\nThen turn 33: move R to (3,5) to go right.\n\nTurn 34: move R to (4,5) to continue right.\n\nNow from (4,5), on turn 35, I can move D to (4,4) to go down to y=4.\n\nThen turn 36: from (4,4), move R to (5,4)\n\nThen turn 37: move R to (6,4) to eat (6,4) if life_span allows.\n\nOn turn 37, (6,4) life_span=1, can be eaten.\n\nBut I need to think if this is safe.\n\nAfter turn 34, head at (4,5), as before.\n\nThen turn 35: move D to (4,4)\n\nAs above.\n\nAfter moving to (4,4), positions: head (4,4), body [ (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) ] tail (6,2) or something, from earlier simulation.\n\nThen turn 36: from (4,4), direction D, move R to (5,4)\n\n(5,4) should be free.\n\nNew head (5,4), body [ (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), ... ] \n\nThen turn 37: from (5,4), direction R (since moved from (4,4) to (5,4)? From (4,4) to (5,4) is right, so direction R.\n\nThen can move U, D, R (not L).\n\nU to (5,5), D to (5,3), R to (6,4).\n\n(6,4) has food, so move R to (6,4) to eat.\n\nNow, (5,3) might be occupied or not.\n\nIn positions, after turn 36: head at (5,4), body [ (4,4), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) ] tail (6,1) or something.\n\nLet's not track all, but (5,3) is not in snake, so should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) is free except for food.\n\nSo moving to (6,4) should be fine.\n\nThen I eat (6,4) on turn 37.\n\nNow, for (6,5), I can go up later.\n\nBut for the sequence, I need to output up to say turn 37 or so.\n\nSince the food at (6,5) has long life, I can plan separately.\n\nBut for now, let's output 5 turns: turn 32 to 36, and action for 37 if possible.\n\nThe answer should include actions starting from turn 32.\n\nAlso, in turn 34, when I move to (4,5), it might be close to the wall at (5,6), but (4,5) is fine.\n\nAnother thing: on turn 33, when I move R to (3,5), from (2,5), is (3,5) safe? Yes.\n\nBut let's confirm if moving U on turn 32 causes any issue.\n\nHead at (2,4), move U to (2,5), which is food, eat.\n\nThen direction U.\n\nThen turn 33, move R to (3,5), now moving right, direction R.\n\nThen turn 34, move R to (4,5), direction R.\n\nThen turn 35, move D to (4,4), now direction D.\n\nThen turn 36, from (4,4), move R to (5,4), direction R.\n\nThen turn 37, move R to (6,4), eat.\n\nBut turn 37 is beyond 5 turns from 32; 32 to 36 is 5 turns? Turn 32,33,34,35,36: that's 5 actions.\n\nTurn 32: action\n\nTurn 33: action\n\nTurn 34: action\n\nTurn 35: action\n\nTurn 36: action\n\nThat's 5 turns.\n\nThen I can stop or continue.\n\nBut for (6,4), eating on turn 37, which is outside.\n\nI could adjust to eat earlier.\n\nFor example, after eating (2,5) on turn 32, on turn 33 instead of going to (3,5), go directly down or something.\n\nFrom (2,5), turn 33: move R to (3,5) as before.\n\nI could go D to (2,4), but (2,4) is body, occupied, and D is opposite to U, not allowed.\n\nSo cannot.\n\nOr L to (1,5), but that might lead to corner.\n\nSo going right is better.\n\nAnother idea: on turn 33, from (2,5), move R to (3,5)\n\nThen turn 34, from (3,5), instead of R to (4,5), move D to (3,4) to go down.\n\nThen from (3,4), go R to (4,4), then to (5,4), then to (6,4).\n\nBut (3,4) might be free.\n\nOn turn 34: from (3,5), move D to (3,4)\n\nThen new head (3,4), body [ (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), ... ] etc.\n\nThen turn 35: from (3,4), can move R to (4,4)\n\nTurn 36: to (5,4)\n\nTurn 37: to (6,4) eat.\n\nSame as before, no gain.\n\nAnd I might be later.\n\nIn the first path, on turn 35 I am at (4,4), which is closer to (6,4) in x, but same y.\n\n(4,4) to (6,4) is two steps right, so turn 36 and 37.\n\nWhereas from (3,4) to (6,4) is three steps.\n\nBut in the first path, on turn 34 I am at (4,5), then turn 35 at (4,4), turn 36 at (5,4), turn 37 at (6,4).\n\nIf on turn 34 I go to (3,4), then turn 35 to (4,4), turn 36 to (5,4), turn 37 to (6,4), same.\n\nBut in first path, on turn 34 I am at (4,5), which is higher y.\n\nNot better.\n\nI think the sequence is fine.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions.\n\nAlso, ensure no collision.\n\nIn the sequence: turn 32: U to (2,5)\n\nThen turn 33: R to (3,5)\n\nThen turn 34: R to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 35: D to (4,4)  // to go down\n\nAfter (4,5), move D to (4,4), which is down.\n\nThen turn 36: from (4,4), move R to (5,4)\n\nThen turn 37: R to (6,4) to eat, but turn 37 not in the 5 turns.\n\nFor 5 turns, up to turn 36.\n\nBut at turn 36, I am at (5,4), and (6,4) is next.\n\nBut I need to think survival.\n\nAnother thing: the internal wall at (5,6), but it's at y=6, so for y=4 and y=5, no issue.\n\nAlso, on the way, cells should be free.\n\nTo be thorough, let's list the actions:\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nTurn 33: R\n\nTurn 34: R\n\nTurn 35: D\n\nTurn 36: R  // to (5,4)\n\nThen for turn 37, I can add if needed, but the output can be multiple lines.\n\nThe format says: \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\"\n\nAnd \"at least 5 turns ahead\", so I should provide 5 actions: for turn 32 to 36.\n\nBut turn 36 is t1+4, since t1=32, t1+1=33, t1+2=34, t1+3=35, t1+4=36, that's 5 turns.\n\nActions: 32,33,34,35,36.\n\nThen on turn 37, I can go to (6,4).\n\nBut in the sequence, on turn 35 I go D to (4,4), then turn 36 R to (5,4).\n\nFrom (5,4), on turn 37, move R to (6,4) to eat.\n\nIs (6,4) still there? Life span: on turn 37, (6,4) life_span=1, can be eaten.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd (6,4) is not under body or anything.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows, and I can go to (6,5) or other.\n\nBut for now, the plan seems good.\n\nTo maximize, I could also eat (6,5) later.\n\nBut I think this is fine.\n\nAnother path: if I go directly to (6,4) without eating (2,5), but I miss the food, so worse.\n\nTherefore, I think moving U on turn 32 is best.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nTurn 33: R\n\nTurn 34: R\n\nTurn 35: D\n\nTurn 36: R\n\nIn turn 35, I move D to (4,4), but from where? On turn 34, head at (4,5), move D to (4,4).\n\nThen turn 36 from (4,4) move R to (5,4).\n\nNow, after that, on turn 37, I can move R to (6,4) to eat.\n\nBut since the output is for 5 turns, I don't need to include turn 37.\n\nBut I can add it for completeness.\n\nThe problem says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", but the output should be the actions for the turns.\n\nI think 5 actions are sufficient.\n\nTo include the eating of (6,4), but it's after.\n\nI think it's ok.\n\nPerhaps on turn 35, from (4,5), I can move directly to (5,5) or something, but (5,5) is not towards (6,4).\n\n(6,4) is at y=4, so going down to (4,4) is better.\n\n(4,5) to (5,5) is right, same y=5, then I need to go down later.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nSo I think the sequence is good.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I analyzed the current state and planned a sequence of moves considering the food life spans, snake path, and potential risks. The key points from the analysis are:\n\n- **Immediate action on turn 32**: The food at (2,5) has a short life span (disappears after turn 34) and is adjacent to the head. Eating it now secures +1 score and increases snake length, which is beneficial for future flexibility. Moving Up (U) to (2,5) is safe and efficient.\n- **Subsequent moves**: After eating (2,5), the snake should head toward (6,4) to eat it before it disappears (life span 6, last chance on turn 37). The path involves moving right to (3,5) and (4,5), then down to (4,4) to align with y=4, and right to (5,4) to approach (6,4).\n- **Risk avoidance**: \n  - Moving Up on turn 32 avoids the risk of missing (2,5), which could cost a point.\n  - The path avoids walls, obstacles, and body collisions. For example, moving Down is never considered due to direction constraints or occupancy.\n  - After turn 36, the snake will be at (5,4), ready to eat (6,4) on turn 37 (life span 1), but this turn is beyond the 5-turn plan.\n- **5+ turns ahead**: The sequence ensures the snake survives and positions itself to eat both (2,5) and (6,4) within their life spans. (6,5) has a long life span (9), so it can be targeted later after securing the urgent food.\n\n**Action Sequence (Turns 32 to 36)**:\n- **Turn 32**: Move U (to (2,5)) to eat the positive food (+1 score, snake length increases to 13). This is safe as (2,5) is not under the body, and the tail is not adjacent.\n- **Turn 33**: Move R (to (3,5)) to head toward (6,4). Direction is now Right, so Left is not allowed next.\n- **Turn 34**: Move R (to (4,5)) to continue right. Direction remains Right.\n- **Turn 35**: Move D (to (4,4)) to descend toward y=4 for easier access to (6,4). Direction is now Down, so Up is not allowed next.\n- **Turn 36**: Move R (to (5,4)) to position for eating (6,4) on turn 37.\n\nThis sequence eats (2,5) immediately, avoids dead ends, and sets up for (6,4) consumption. Beyond turn 36, the snake can move R to (6,4) on turn 37 to eat it (life span 1) and then consider (6,5).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 32: U \\\\\nTurn 33: R \\\\\nTurn 34: R \\\\\nTurn 35: D \\\\\nTurn 36: R\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 33. The grid has walls at the borders, so x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are all walls. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nThe snake positions are: head at (2,5), then (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3). So the head is at (2,5), and the tail is at (4,3). The snake is currently moving upwards, as per the head direction \"U\".\n\nThere are two food items:\n\n- (6,4) with life span 5 and value 1 (positive food)\n\n- (6,5) with life span 8 and value 1 (positive food)\n\nBoth are positive food, so eating them increases the snake's length by 1 and gives +1 score.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead to maximize score while avoiding risks. Prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nFirst, let's sketch the grid to visualize this. The grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), with walls on the borders. Internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nSnake positions:\n\n- Head: (2,5)\n\n- Body: (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)\n\nSo the snake body forms a sort of \"L\" shape or something. From (2,5) down to (2,1), then right to (6,1), then up to (6,3), then left to (5,3), then to (4,3).\n\nCurrent head direction is up, so from (2,5), moving up would go to (2,6). But y=7 is a wall, so y=6 is within bounds since walls are at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is okay? Grid coordinates: let's assume (0,0) is bottom-left, (7,7) top-right? But in the positions, y values go from 1 to 5, and walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=0 and y=7 are walls, so valid y from 1 to 6? Let's clarify.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=1 to 6 are valid. Similarly y=1 to 6 valid, since y=0 and y=7 are walls.\n\nIn the snake positions, we have (2,1), (2,2), etc., up to (2,5), and (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), so y=1 to 5 are occupied, and (6,5) is a food, so y=5 must be valid? y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 to 6 are valid cells. Similarly x=1 to 6.\n\n(6,5) is a food, which is valid since x=6, y=5.\n\nNow, head at (2,5), moving up. Possible moves: U, D, L, R. But cannot move opposite to current direction instantly. Current direction is U, so cannot move D (down) on next turn. So possible moves from (2,5) are U, L, R.\n\n- U: to (2,6)\n\n- D: not possible, since opposite\n\n- L: to (1,5) or (2-1,5) = (1,5)\n\n- R: to (3,5)\n\nNow, check for collisions:\n\n- (2,6): is it occupied? Snake positions: (2,5) head, (2,4) is body, so (2,6) is not in snake positions. Walls: y=7 is wall, but (2,6) is y=6, which is not wall. x=2 is fine. So (2,6) is empty? But there might be food or something. Food is at (6,4) and (6,5), not at (2,6). So (2,6) should be free.\n\n- (1,5): x=1, y=5. Walls: x=0 is wall, but x=1 is valid. Snake positions: (2,5), (2,4), etc., no (1,5), so free.\n\n- (3,5): similarly, x=3,y=5, not in snake positions, not wall, so free.\n\nBut I need to think about future moves.\n\nAlso, food: (6,4) and (6,5) both positive, life span 5 and 8, meaning they disappear after 5 and 8 turns from now? Life span decreases every turn, including current.\n\nTurn t1=33, so food at (6,4) has life span 5, so it will disappear after turn 33+5=38? Let's see: life span decreases every turn including current, so if we are at turn 33, and life span is 5, it means after 5 more turns it disappears. So on turn 34, life span becomes 4, then turn 35:3, ..., turn 38:0, so disappears after turn 38, meaning it can be eaten up to turn 38? Or on turn 38 it is still there but after that gone.\n\nTypically, if life span is N at turn t, it decreases to N-1 at turn t+1, and when it reaches 0, it disappears. So at turn t, if life span is L, it can be eaten on turns t to t+L-1, and disappears at turn t+L.\n\nFor (6,4): life span 5 at turn 33, so it can be eaten on turns 33,34,35,36,37. After that, on turn 38, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5): life span 8, can be eaten from turn 33 to 40, disappears on turn 41.\n\nNow, snake head at (2,5). I need to plan multiple moves ahead.\n\nPossible immediate actions: U to (2,6), L to (1,5), or R to (3,5).\n\nBut I should consider the food positions. Food is at (6,4) and (6,5), which are both on the right side.\n\nAlso, the snake has a long body, so I need to be careful not to trap myself.\n\nCurrent snake length: let's count positions: (2,5),(2,4),(2,3),(2,2),(2,1),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(5,3),(4,3) — that's 13 segments.\n\nAfter eating food, length increases by 1.\n\nNow, the tail is at (4,3). When the snake moves, the tail moves, so the cell that was tail might become free.\n\nAlso, about food under body: in this case, no food is under snake body, I think. Food at (6,4) and (6,5), snake has (6,3) and (6,2), etc., but (6,4) is not occupied by snake? Snake positions: (6,1),(6,2),(6,3) are occupied, so (6,4) is free, has food. Similarly (6,5) is free.\n\n(6,4) is occupied? Snake has (6,3), but (6,4) is not listed, so it should be empty with food.\n\nPositions: ... (6,2), (6,3), then (5,3), so (6,4) is not occupied, yes.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) not occupied.\n\nNow, to reach (6,4) or (6,5), from (2,5), it's 4 steps right and then down or up, but need to go to x=6.\n\nPath to (6,4): from (2,5) to (6,4) is delta x=+4, delta y=-1.\n\nSimilarly to (6,5): delta x=+4, delta y=0.\n\nBut I need to move the snake step by step.\n\nAlso, there's an internal obstacle at (5,6), which might block paths.\n\n(5,6) is a wall, so cannot go there.\n\nNow, let's think about possible moves for multiple turns.\n\nFirst, I should consider the risk of moving towards the food but colliding or getting trapped.\n\nSince the food is on the right, moving right might be good, but let's see the body.\n\nCurrent position: head at (2,5), body going down to (2,1), then right to (6,1), up to (6,3), then left to (5,3) and (4,3).\n\nSo the area around (2,5) to (3,5) might be safe, but (4,5) and above could be free or not.\n\nList all occupied cells to see free cells.\n\nGrid: x 1 to 6, y 1 to 6.\n\nOccupied:\n\n- Row y=1: (2,1),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1)\n\n- Row y=2: (2,2)\n\n- Row y=3: (2,3), (6,3), (5,3), (4,3)\n\n- Row y=4: (2,4)\n\n- Row y=5: (2,5) head\n\n- Row y=6: nothing? (5,6) is wall, so not occupiable.\n\nFree cells: for example, (1,1) to (1,6) except walls, but x=1,y=1 to6 should be free except if occupied.\n\n(1,1): not in snake, not wall, free\n\n(1,2): free\n\n(1,3): free\n\n(1,4): free\n\n(1,5): free\n\n(1,6): free? y=6 is valid, x=1 valid.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2): not occupied\n\n(3,3): not occupied, since snake has (2,3) but not (3,3)\n\nSnake: (2,3) at y=3,x=2, then (2,2) at y=2,x=2, so (3,3) is free.\n\n(3,4): free\n\n(3,5): free\n\n(4,4): free? not occupied\n\n(4,5): free\n\n(4,6): free, but (5,6) wall, so (4,6) is valid? x=4,y=6, walls x=0,7 y=0,7, so (4,6) should be free.\n\n(5,4): free\n\n(5,5): free\n\n(6,4): food\n\n(6,5): food\n\n(6,6): free? not wall, not occupied, since snake up to (6,3), so (6,4) food, (6,5) food, (6,6) free.\n\n(3,6), (4,6), etc.\n\nAlso (5,2), (5,4), etc.\n\nNow, back to immediate move from (2,5).\n\nOptions:\n\n- U to (2,6): y=6, which is one below wall y=7, so safe. Then from (2,6), I can go U, L, R, but U would be to (2,7) which is wall, so not possible. So from (2,6), possible L to (1,6), R to (3,6), or D to (2,5), but (2,5) is where body was, but after move, when head moves to (2,6), the body shifts, so tail moves, so (2,5) becomes the new segment after head? Let's think snake movement.\n\nWhen snake moves, head goes to new position, each segment moves to the next position, so the tail position is vacated.\n\nSo from current: head at (2,5), move to (2,6). Then new positions: head (2,6), then body: (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), etc. down to (4,3) but the tail (4,3) will be removed, so the snake shortens temporarily? No, when moving without eating, length same, so tail moves forward.\n\nStandard snake: when moving to a new cell, if not eating, head goes to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position, tail is removed.\n\nSo after move to (2,6): head (2,6), body: (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) — and (4,3) is gone, since tail moved.\n\nOriginal positions 13 segments. After move, head to new, so 12 segments move to the next, tail removed, so 12 segments? No: the list has 13 positions. After move, the head is at new position, and the body from segment 1 to 12 are at positions that were segment 0 to 11, but segment 12 (tail) is gone.\n\nIndices: let's say positions: index 0: head (2,5), index 1: (2,4), index 2: (2,3), index 3: (2,2), index 4: (2,1), index 5: (3,1), index 6: (4,1), index 7: (5,1), index 8: (6,1), index 9: (6,2), index 10: (6,3), index 11: (5,3), index 12: (4,3) tail.\n\nAfter moving head to (2,6), new head at (2,6). Then body: segment 1 moves to where head was (2,5), segment 2 to where seg1 was (2,4), ..., segment 12 to where seg11 was (5,3), and seg12 (4,3) is vacated. So new positions: head (2,6), then (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3). So tail is now (5,3), and (4,3) is free.\n\nSimilarly for other moves.\n\nBut in this case, for move to (2,6), it's safe, no collision.\n\nThen from (2,6), I can go L to (1,6), R to (3,6), or D to (2,5). But (2,5) is now body, so if I go D to (2,5), head collides with body, death. So cannot go back to (2,5) immediately after.\n\nFrom (2,6), moving D to (2,5) would collide with the body segment there.\n\nSimilarly, U not possible, so only L or R.\n\nL to (1,6) or R to (3,6).\n\n(1,6) is free, (3,6) is free.\n\nBut let's think about the food.\n\nFood at (6,4) and (6,5) are to the right.\n\nIf I go to (2,6), I'm going away from the food, and y=6 is top row, which might be risky if I get trapped.\n\nSimilarly, moving L to (1,5): from (2,5) to (1,5). Then new head (1,5), body (2,5), (2,4), etc., tail (4,3) gone, new tail (5,3)? After move to (1,5): head (1,5), body: (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) — tail (5,3).\n\n(1,5) is free, so safe.\n\nThen from (1,5), possible moves: U to (1,6), D to (1,4), L not possible since x=0 wall, R to (2,5) but (2,5) is body, so collide if go R.\n\nCurrent direction after move to (1,5): since moved L from (2,5), new direction L, so cannot move R (opposite) on next turn.\n\nSo from (1,5), can go U, D, or L but L is wall, so only U or D.\n\nU to (1,6), D to (1,4).\n\n(1,4) is free, I think.\n\nBut again, moving left might not help reach food.\n\nNow, moving R to (3,5) from (2,5): to (3,5), which is free. Then new head (3,5), body (2,5), (2,4), etc., tail gone, new tail (5,3).\n\nFrom (3,5), can go U, D, R (since moved R, new direction R, so cannot move L opposite).\n\nU to (3,6), D to (3,4), R to (4,5).\n\n(3,6) free, (3,4) free, (4,5) free.\n\n(4,5) is closer to the food area.\n\nTo reach (6,4) or (6,5), I need to go right.\n\nFrom (2,5), moving R to (3,5) seems better than U or L for approaching food.\n\nBut let's think 5 turns ahead.\n\nAlso, there's a danger with tail reward: if head adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because after eating, tail doesn't move, so head and new tail collide.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (4,3). Head at (2,5), not adjacent; (4,3) is two away, so not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing a side, so (2,5) adjacent to (2,4), (2,6), (1,5), (3,5) — not to (4,3). So no issue now.\n\nBut when moving, it might become adjacent later.\n\nNow, food life span: (6,4) disappears after turn 37, so we have until turn 37 to eat it. (6,5) until turn 40.\n\nTurn 33 now, so 5 turns to eat (6,4), which is tight.\n\nDistance to (6,4): from (2,5) to (6,4) is |2-6| + |5-4| = 4 + 1 = 5 Manhattan distance, but since snake moves one per turn, minimum 5 moves to reach, but need to path around.\n\nDirectly: right 4 times, then down, but from (2,5) to (6,5) is 4 right, then to (6,4) down, but (6,5) has food, so if I go to (6,5) first, I eat it.\n\nSimilarly, to (6,4) directly.\n\nBut the path might be blocked or have obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,6), which is above, so for (6,5), it might be accessible.\n\nLet's find a path to the food.\n\nFirst, from (2,5), move to (3,5) - R.\n\nThen from (3,5), I can go to (4,5) - R again.\n\nThen from (4,5) to (5,5) - R.\n\nThen from (5,5) to (6,5) - R, eat food at (6,5).\n\nThat's 4 moves: R, R, R, R to (6,5) on turn 37? Let's see turns.\n\nTurn 33: at (2,5), move R to (3,5)\n\nTurn 34: at (3,5), move R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 35: at (4,5), move R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 36: at (5,5), move R to (6,5) — eat food, since (6,5) has food, so on turn 36, head moves to (6,5), eats food, length increases, tail does not move, so new position: head (6,5), body adds, so the body includes the previous head position, but since ate, tail stays.\n\nAfter eating, when head moves to food cell, snake grows, so tail remains, new segment added.\n\nSo after move to (6,5), head (6,5), body: previous positions, but since ate, the tail doesn't shorten, so all segments remain, plus new head, so length increases.\n\nSpecifically: before move, positions: let's say at turn 36 start, head at (5,5), body behind.\n\nAfter move to (6,5), head (6,5), body: the previous head to tail, all kept, so snake longer.\n\nIn this case, on turn 36, move to (6,5), eat food, so length increases by 1.\n\nSimilarly, for (6,4).\n\nBut in the path above, I can reach (6,5) in 4 moves, by turn 36, which is before it disappears on turn 41.\n\n(6,4) disappears earlier, on turn 38, so can be eaten up to turn 37.\n\nIn the path to (6,5), I pass through (4,5), (5,5), which are free, and (6,5) is food.\n\nIs there any risk?\n\nFirst, from (2,5) to (3,5): is (3,5) safe? Yes, not occupied, not wall.\n\nThen to (4,5): (4,5) free.\n\nTo (5,5): (5,5) free? Not occupied, not wall. But (5,6) is wall, but (5,5) is fine.\n\nTo (6,5): (6,5) has food, so eat.\n\nBut when I move to (6,5), the cell might be safe.\n\nNow, after eating, the snake grows, and tail is still there.\n\nBut I need to check if I can do this without colliding.\n\nAnother thing: the body positions. When I move from (2,5) to (3,5), the body shifts, so (2,5) becomes body, etc., but (3,5) was free, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut after moving to (3,5) on turn 33, the snake positions change.\n\nTurn 33: start head (2,5), move R to (3,5)\n\nNew positions: head (3,5), body: (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3) — tail (5,3), since (4,3) gone.\n\nOriginal tail was (4,3), after move, it's removed.\n\nNow, (5,3) is the new tail.\n\nTurn 34: from (3,5) move R to (4,5)\n\nNew head (4,5), body: (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) — and (5,3) gone? Let's see: positions before move: head (3,5), body (2,5) to (5,3) but (5,3) is tail.\n\nAfter move to (4,5): head (4,5), then body: (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), ..., up to (6,3)? The segments: previous head (3,5) becomes first body, then (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) — and (5,3) was tail, not included, so new tail is (6,3) or something.\n\nList indices before turn 34 move: positions after turn 33: index 0: (3,5) head, index 1: (2,5), index 2: (2,4), index 3: (2,3), index 4: (2,2), index 5: (2,1), index 6: (3,1), index 7: (4,1), index 8: (5,1), index 9: (6,1), index 10: (6,2), index 11: (6,3) — 12 segments? Original 13, after one move without eating, should be 12 segments.\n\nAfter turn 33 move: head to (3,5), body: the first body is where head was (2,5), then (2,4), ..., down to (6,3), and (5,3) is gone. Original positions 13, after move no eat, 12 positions.\n\nIn the list: (3,5) head, (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) — that's 12 positions, tail at (6,3).\n\n(5,3) is gone.\n\nTurn 34: move R to (4,5)\n\nNew head (4,5), body: (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) — and (6,3) gone, so tail (6,2)? Positions: head (4,5), then (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) — tail (6,2).\n\n(6,3) was tail, removed.\n\nNow turn 35: from (4,5) move R to (5,5)\n\nNew head (5,5), body: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) — tail (6,1), since (6,2) gone.\n\n(6,2) was tail, removed.\n\nTurn 36: from (5,5) move R to (6,5)\n\n(6,5) has food, so eat it. Head to (6,5), and since eating, the body stays, so positions: head (6,5), body: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) — and new segment, but since ate, the tail doesn't move, so (6,1) remains, and we add a new segment where? When eating, head moves to food, the tail doesn't advance, so the body is the same as before plus the new head position, so length increases by one.\n\nSpecifically, before move, positions: head (5,5), body (4,5) to (6,1), 12 positions? After turn 35, positions: head (5,5), body (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) — that's 12 segments including head? No, head and 11 body, total 12.\n\nStandard: N positions, after move no eat, N positions; after move and eat, N+1 positions.\n\nBefore move to (6,5), at turn 36 start, positions: 12 segments.\n\nMove head to (6,5), which has food, so eat, grow. New positions: head (6,5), then the previous positions: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) — all kept, so 13 segments now.\n\nTail at (6,1).\n\nNow, after eating at (6,5), there is still food at (6,4), which can be eaten until turn 37.\n\nNow, on turn 36, we are at (6,5), head direction R.\n\nFrom (6,5), possible moves: U, D, L, but cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is R (since we moved R to get here), so cannot move L (left) on next turn.\n\nSo can move U to (6,6), D to (6,4), or R but x=7 wall, so R not possible.\n\nU to (6,6): y=6, not wall, free? (6,6) is not occupied, not wall, so free.\n\nD to (6,4): (6,4) has food, so if move there, eat it.\n\nBut we need to check if it's safe.\n\nFirst, if we move D to (6,4) on turn 37, we eat it, but let's see the positions.\n\nTurn 37: from (6,5), move D to (6,4)\n\n(6,4) has food, so eat. New head (6,4), body: previous positions, but since ate, tail doesn't move, so body includes (6,5), (5,5), etc.\n\nSpecifically: before move, head (6,5), body (5,5) to (6,1).\n\nAfter move to (6,4), head (6,4), body: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) — all kept, tail (6,1), length 14 now.\n\nIs there any collision? Moving to (6,4), which was not occupied before, and no wall, so safe.\n\nBut after this, we are at (6,4), with body around.\n\nBut we have eaten both foods by turn 37.\n\n(6,4) eaten on turn 37, which is within life span (up to turn 37).\n\n(6,5) eaten on turn 36.\n\nNow, after that, we need to survive.\n\nBut in this plan, we eat both foods, but let's see if we can do it earlier.\n\n(6,4) can be eaten earlier, but from (2,5), going directly to (6,4) might be faster? But to (6,4), we need to go right and down.\n\nFor example, from (2,5) to (3,5) R, then to (4,5) R, then to (5,5) R, then to (5,4) D? (5,4) is free, then to (6,4) R.\n\nBut (5,4) to (6,4) is R, but (6,4) has food.\n\nTurn 33: R to (3,5)\n\nTurn 34: R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 35: D to (4,4)? From (4,5), move D to (4,4)\n\n(4,4) free? Not occupied, yes.\n\nThen turn 36: R to (5,4)? (5,4) free.\n\nTurn 37: R to (6,4) eat.\n\nBut this takes until turn 37, same as before, but we miss (6,5) or eat it later? In this path, we go to (4,4) then (5,4) then (6,4), but (6,5) is not eaten, we could eat it after.\n\nBut in the first path, we eat (6,5) on turn 36 and (6,4) on turn 37.\n\nIn this alternative, we eat (6,4) on turn 37, but (6,5) is still there, we can eat it later.\n\nBut since (6,5) has longer life, we can prioritize (6,4) which disappears sooner.\n\nIn the first plan, by going to (6,5) first, we eat it on turn 36, then (6,4) on turn 37.\n\nIn the second, we eat (6,4) on turn 37 directly.\n\nBut eating (6,5) first is fine since life span longer.\n\nNow, in the first plan, when we move to (6,5) on turn 36, we are at (6,5), then on turn 37 move to (6,4) to eat the other food.\n\nIs moving to (6,4) from (6,5) safe? Yes, as above.\n\nBut after eating both, we are at (6,4) with a long snake, and the area might be congested.\n\nFor example, after turn 37, head at (6,4), body (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\nNow, from (6,4), we can move, say, U to (6,5) but (6,5) is body now, so collide.\n\nD to (6,3): (6,3) might be occupied or not.\n\nIn the positions, (6,3) was part of body earlier, but after moves, let's see.\n\nAfter turn 37, positions: head (6,4), body (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) — so (6,3) is not occupied? (6,3) was occupied at some point, but now not in positions. Specifically, in the list, we have (6,1), but not (6,2) or (6,3). (6,2) and (6,3) were vacated.\n\nAfter turn 37, occupied: (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), ..., down to (6,1). (6,1) is occupied, but (6,2) and (6,3) are free? Let's list y for x=6: (6,5), (6,4), (6,1) — so (6,2) and (6,3) are free.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) is free.\n\nFrom (6,4), head, can move U to (6,5) but (6,5) is body, collision.\n\nD to (6,3): (6,3) free, so possible.\n\nL to (5,4): (5,4) free? Not occupied, yes.\n\nR not possible, wall.\n\nCurrent direction: on turn 37, we moved D to (6,4), so new direction D.\n\nSo cannot move U (opposite) on next turn.\n\nSo from (6,4), can move D to (6,3), L to (5,4), or R not possible.\n\n(6,3) is free, (5,4) is free.\n\nSo we can move, say, to (6,3) or (5,4).\n\nBut we have eaten both foods, so now focus on survival.\n\nIn the first plan, we can eat both foods by turn 37.\n\nBut is this the only way? We could go for (6,4) first.\n\nBut (6,4) life span shorter, so better to eat it soon.\n\nAnother option: from (2,5), move U to (2,6), but that might delay reaching food.\n\n(2,6) is top-left, food is bottom-right, so far away.\n\nSimilarly, moving L to (1,5) is left, also far.\n\nSo moving R seems best to approach food.\n\nBut we need to consider risks.\n\nFor example, when we move to (3,5), is there any immediate danger?\n\n(3,5) is free, and after move, the body is below, so not trapped.\n\nSimilarly, proceeding right.\n\nBut what about the internal obstacle at (5,6)? It might affect if we go up, but in this path, we stay at y=5, so no issue.\n\n(5,6) is wall, so we cannot go there, but we are at (5,5), which is fine.\n\nNow, another food: (6,4) and (6,5), both positive.\n\nBut in the state, only two foods.\n\nNow, after eating both, we need to find a way to survive long-term.\n\nBut since we are to think 5+ turns ahead, and prioritize survival.\n\nIn this case, by turn 37, we have eaten both, and we are at (6,4) with head direction down.\n\nThen we can move, say, to (6,3) or (5,4).\n\n(6,3) is free, so move D to (6,3).\n\nThen from there, we can go left or down, etc.\n\nBut the snake body is long, and the grid has free space on the left.\n\nFor example, cells like (1,1) to (1,6), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), etc., are free, so we can navigate to open areas.\n\nBut for now, since we need to output actions for multiple turns, but the answer format is to output actions starting from turn t1=33.\n\nThe format is to list actions for several turns, but it doesn't specify how many, but since it says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", probably output at least 5 moves.\n\nIn the boxed answer, it should be like:\n\nTurn 33: action\n\nTurn 34: action\n\n...\n\nUp to, say, when we reach the food or a few more.\n\nBut since we have a clear path to the food, we can plan to go directly.\n\nBut we need to consider if there are risks with the tail or something.\n\nAnother thing: tail reward danger. But in this case, when we approach the food, the tail is not adjacent to head when eating.\n\nFor example, when we eat (6,5) on turn 36, head at (6,5), tail is at (6,1), not adjacent.\n\nSimilarly for (6,4), head at (6,4), tail at (6,1) or something, not adjacent.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nNow, what about moving to (2,6) or other directions? It might be safer to avoid the crowded area, but since we can reach the food quickly and eat both, it seems efficient.\n\nBut let's check the life span: (6,4) life span 5, disappears after turn 37, so we must eat it by turn 37.\n\nFrom (2,5), if we go to (2,6), then we are at (2,6), which is farther, and to reach (6,4) we need at least 4 moves right and one down, but from (2,6) to (6,4) is |2-6|=4 in x, |6-4|=2 in y, so min 6 moves, but we have only 5 turns to eat (6,4) by turn 37.\n\nTurn 33 to 37 inclusive? Turns to eat: on turn 33, if we move to (6,4), but we are at (2,5).\n\nEarliest we can be at (6,4) is turn 37 with the path above.\n\nIf we go to (2,6) on turn 33, then on turn 34 we can go to (3,6), turn 35 to (4,6), but (5,6) is wall, so cannot go to (5,6), so from (4,6) we need to go down or something.\n\nFrom (4,6) to (4,5), then to (5,5), then to (6,5), then to (6,4), but that takes more turns.\n\nTurn 33: U to (2,6)\n\nTurn 34: from (2,6), can go R to (3,6) (since cannot go D or L? Direction: moved U to (2,6), so direction U, so can go U not possible, L to (1,6), R to (3,6), D to (2,5) but body, collide.\n\nSo go R to (3,6)\n\nTurn 35: from (3,6) to (4,6) R\n\nTurn 36: from (4,6), move D to (4,5) (since U not possible? Direction R, so can go U, D, R, but U to (4,7) wall, R to (5,6) wall, so only D to (4,5)\n\nTurn 37: from (4,5) to (5,5) R\n\nTurn 38: from (5,5) to (6,5) R, eat (6,5)\n\nBut (6,4) disappears after turn 37? On turn 38, (6,4) is gone if life span 5 at turn 33.\n\nLife span decreases every turn, including current.\n\nAt turn 33, life span 5, so:\n\nTurn 33: L=5\n\nTurn 34: L=4\n\nTurn 35: L=3\n\nTurn 36: L=2\n\nTurn 37: L=1, can be eaten\n\nTurn 38: L=0, disappears, cannot be eaten.\n\nSimilarly for (6,5), L=8 at turn 33, disappears on turn 41.\n\nSo to eat (6,4), must be on or before turn 37.\n\nIn the above path, we reach (6,5) on turn 38, but (6,4) is gone.\n\nIf we go directly to (6,4) from (4,5), but on turn 37 we are at (4,5), to (6,4) in one move? No, need two moves: to (5,5) or (5,4), then to (6,4).\n\nBut on turn 37, from (4,5), we can move to (5,5), but (6,4) not reached.\n\nTo (4,4) then to (5,4), but (5,4) to (6,4) on turn 38, too late.\n\nSo if we go up to (2,6), we cannot reach (6,4) in time to eat it before it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, moving left to (1,5) is even worse.\n\nTherefore, moving right to (3,5) is necessary to reach the food in time.\n\nMoreover, by going right, we can eat both foods.\n\nNow, about the internal obstacle (5,6), it doesn't affect this path since we are at y=5.\n\nBut if we need to go up later, it might block, but for now, fine.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions starting from turn 33.\n\nWith the plan: turn 33: R to (3,5)\n\nThen turn 34: R to (4,5)\n\nTurn 35: R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 36: R to (6,5) eat first food\n\nThen turn 37: D to (6,4) eat second food\n\nNow, after that, we need to move away to survive.\n\nBut since the answer format might not require all moves, but to show the plan, we can output up to turn 37 or a bit more.\n\nThe instruction says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", and output in the format.\n\nCurrent turn 33, so think ahead to turn 38 or so.\n\nBut we can output actions for turns 33 to 37.\n\nTurn 33,34,35,36,37: that's 5 turns.\n\nThen for turn 37, we eat the food.\n\nBut on turn 37, we are moving to (6,4).\n\nAfter that, we need to decide further, but perhaps for the answer, we can stop or continue.\n\nSince it says \"maximize score\", and after eating both, we can try to find more food, but no more food given, so probably just survive.\n\nBut food might spawn later, but not specified, so assume only existing food.\n\nIn the state, only two foods, both will be eaten by turn 37.\n\nNow, to be safe, after turn 37, from (6,4), we can move to (6,3) or (5,4).\n\nSay, move D to (6,3) on turn 38.\n\nBut we don't need to output beyond, or we can.\n\nThe format is to list actions for several turns, but not specified how many.\n\nPerhaps output for 5 turns: turn 33 to 37.\n\nBut turn 37 is included.\n\nTurn 33 to 37: 5 actions.\n\nNow, in the sequence, on turn 36, we move R to (6,5), which is eating, and on turn 37, D to (6,4), eating again.\n\nIs there any risk in moving to (6,5) on turn 36?\n\nAt that point, (6,5) is free, no issue.\n\nBut after moving to (6,5), the body includes (5,5), etc., but (6,4) is below, free.\n\nWhen we move down to (6,4), it should be fine.\n\nAnother thing: the wall at (5,6) might be irrelevant here.\n\nPerhaps we can eat (6,4) first if possible, but from (2,5), it takes the same time.\n\nFor example, go to (3,5), (4,5), then (4,4), (5,4), (6,4) but that might be slower or same.\n\nTurn 33: R to (3,5)\n\nTurn 34: D to (3,4)? But from (3,5), move D to (3,4)\n\n(3,4) free? Not occupied, yes.\n\nThen turn 35: R to (4,4)\n\nTurn 36: R to (5,4)\n\nTurn 37: R to (6,4) eat.\n\nBut we miss (6,5), and on turn 37 we eat (6,4), then (6,5) is still there, we can eat it later.\n\nBut (6,5) has life span until turn 40, so we can go to (6,5) after.\n\nFor example, on turn 38, from (6,4) move U to (6,5) but if we move to (6,4) on turn 37, head at (6,4), direction R (since moved R to get there).\n\nThen from (6,4), can move U to (6,5), which has food, so eat it on turn 38.\n\nBut when moving U to (6,5), is it safe? On turn 38, (6,5) might be free or not.\n\nAfter turn 37: ate at (6,4), so head (6,4), body: (6,5)? When we move to (6,4) on turn 37, from where?\n\nIn this path: turn 37: from (5,4) move R to (6,4), eat.\n\nBefore move, at turn 37 start, head at (5,4), body behind.\n\nAfter move to (6,4), head (6,4), body: (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), etc., and since ate, tail stays.\n\nWhat was the position before? Turn 36: head at (5,4), after move to (5,4) from (4,4) on turn 36? Let's not confuse.\n\nIn this alternative: turn 33: R to (3,5)\n\nTurn 34: D to (3,4)  // down\n\nTurn 35: R to (4,4)\n\nTurn 36: R to (5,4)\n\nTurn 37: R to (6,4) eat\n\nNow, after turn 37, head at (6,4), body: (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), and previous. Specifically, positions: head (6,4), body (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5)? After turn 36: when moved to (5,4) on turn 36, head (5,4), body (4,4), (3,4), (3,5)? Let's track.\n\nAfter turn 34: moved to (3,4), head (3,4), body (3,5)? From turn 34: start head (3,5) after turn 33, move D to (3,4), so new head (3,4), body: (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), etc. down to tail.\n\nThen turn 35: move R to (4,4), head (4,4), body (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), etc.\n\nTurn 36: move R to (5,4), head (5,4), body (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), etc.\n\nTurn 37: move R to (6,4), eat, so head (6,4), body (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), ... down to (6,1) or whatever.\n\nNow (6,5) is still there, free.\n\nOn turn 38, from (6,4), direction R, so can move U, D, or R not possible.\n\nU to (6,5): (6,5) has food, so move there and eat.\n\nBut (6,5) is adjacent and has food, but is the tail adjacent? Head at (6,4), tail is somewhere, say (6,1) or earlier, not adjacent.\n\nSo move U to (6,5) eat on turn 38.\n\nBut in the first plan, we eat both by turn 37, one turn earlier, so better to eat (6,5) first then (6,4), since we get the score earlier and both within time.\n\nIn first plan, eat (6,5) on 36, (6,4) on 37.\n\nIn second, eat (6,4) on 37, (6,5) on 38.\n\nBut (6,5) can be eaten later, no issue, but since we can eat earlier, why not.\n\nMoreover, in the first plan, after eating (6,5) on 36, we are at (6,5), then move down to (6,4) to eat, which is efficient.\n\nIn the alternative, we go to (3,4) etc., which might be closer to body, but no collision.\n\nBut I think the first path is fine.\n\nNow, back to the immediate move.\n\nAnother consideration: the snake has a segment at (5,3) or something, but in the path, it should be okay.\n\nPerhaps moving up or left could explore other areas, but with the food time limit, we should go right.\n\nMoreover, the grid has free space on the left, but food is on right.\n\nSo I think moving right is best.\n\nTherefore, for turn 33: move R to (3,5)\n\nThen subsequent moves as above.\n\nNow for the answer, output actions for turn 33 to 37.\n\nTurn 33: R\n\nTurn 34: R (to (4,5))\n\nTurn 35: R (to (5,5))\n\nTurn 36: R (to (6,5), eat)\n\nTurn 37: D (to (6,4), eat)\n\nAfter that, on turn 38, we can move to (6,3) or something, but not necessary to output.\n\nSince we thought 5 turns ahead, this should be fine.\n\nBut to be precise, in the sequence, on turn 35, we move to (5,5), which is adjacent to the wall at (5,6), but (5,6) is obstacle, but (5,5) is fine.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSo the actions:\n\nTurn 33: R\n\nTurn 34: R\n\nTurn 35: R\n\nTurn 36: R\n\nTurn 37: D\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut we need to specify the action for each turn starting from t1.\n\nAlso, in the box.\n\nSo for the current state.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score by eating both positive food items while avoiding risks, the plan prioritizes reaching the food at (6,5) and (6,4) efficiently within their life spans, as both provide +1 score and increase snake length. The food at (6,4) has a life span of 5, disappearing after turn 38 (can be eaten up to turn 37), and the food at (6,5) has a life span of 8, disappearing after turn 41 (can be eaten up to turn 40). Starting from turn 33 with the snake head at (2,5) and direction \"U\", moving right (R) immediately allows the snake to approach the food in the minimum number of moves.\n\n### Key Considerations for 5+ Turns Ahead:\n- **Path to Food**: The Manhattan distance from (2,5) to (6,5) is 4, achievable in 4 moves by moving right each turn. Eating (6,5) on turn 36 is safe and within life span. Then, moving down (D) to (6,4) on turn 37 eats the second food before it disappears.\n- **Collision Avoidance**: \n  - Moving right from (2,5) to (3,5) is safe, as (3,5) is unoccupied and not a wall.\n  - Subsequent moves to (4,5), (5,5), and (6,5) are collision-free, as these cells are free and body segments shift away.\n  - After eating at (6,5), moving down to (6,4) is safe because (6,4) is unoccupied before the move, and no body collision occurs.\n- **Tail Reward Danger**: At no point is the head adjacent to the tail when food is eaten, so this risk is avoided.\n- **Life Span Management**: \n  - (6,4) must be eaten by turn 37; this plan achieves it on turn 37.\n  - (6,5) is eaten on turn 36, well within its life span.\n- **Long-Term Survival**: After eating both foods, the snake is at (6,4) with direction \"D\" on turn 37. From there, moving down to (6,3) or left to (5,4) on subsequent turns avoids walls and body collisions, allowing navigation to open areas (e.g., left side of grid) for survival. The grid has ample free space (e.g., (1,1)-(1,6), (3,2)-(3,4), (4,4), (5,4)), ensuring the snake can maneuver safely beyond the 5-turn horizon.\n- **Risks of Alternatives**: \n  - Moving up (U) to (2,6) or left (L) to (1,5) delays reaching the food, risking that (6,4) disappears before it can be eaten (as it requires 6+ moves from (2,6)).\n  - Moving down (D) is impossible due to the \"no instant reverse\" rule (current direction is \"U\").\n\n### Planned Actions (Turns 33 to 37):\n- **Turn 33**: Move R (right) to (3,5). This starts the approach to the food, avoiding the body and walls. Direction becomes \"R\".\n- **Turn 34**: Move R (right) to (4,5). Continues the efficient path right; (4,5) is free. Direction remains \"R\".\n- **Turn 35**: Move R (right) to (5,5). (5,5) is free and not blocked by the obstacle at (5,6). Direction remains \"R\".\n- **Turn 36**: Move R (right) to (6,5). Eats positive food (+1 score, length +1). Direction remains \"R\".\n- **Turn 37**: Move D (down) to (6,4). Eats positive food (+1 score, length +1). Direction becomes \"D\".\n\nThis sequence eats both foods by turn 37, maximizing immediate score gain. For survival beyond turn 37, moving D to (6,3) or L to (5,4) is recommended to access open areas, but these are not included in the 5-turn output.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 33: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 34: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 35: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 36: R (right) \\\\\nTurn 37: D (down)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 34. The grid has walls: borders at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and an internal obstacle at (5,6). So the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls block those cells.\n\nSnake positions: head at (3,5), then body segments: (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3). So the snake has 13 segments. Head is at (3,5), and the tail is at (5,3).\n\nSnake head direction is R, which is right, so it's moving towards increasing x.\n\nFood positions:\n\n- (6,4) with value 1 and life span 4\n\n- (6,5) with value 1 and life span 7\n\n- (5,4) with value 1 and life span 10\n\nAll food has value +1, so they're all positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n\nLife span: (6,4) disappears after 4 turns, including current turn, so it has 4 turns left. Since current turn is 34, it will disappear after turn 37? Let's clarify life span.\n\nThe problem says: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo for food at (6,4), life_span=4, meaning it will disappear after 4 more turns, including turn 34. So after turn 34, life span decreases to 3; after turn 35, to 2; after turn 36, to 1; after turn 37, it disappears. So it can be eaten until turn 37, but on turn 38 it's gone. Similarly for others.\n\n(6,5): life span 7, disappears after turn 40 (34+6? Let's calculate: from turn 34, after 7 turns including current, so after turn 40? Turn 34: countdown 7, turn 35:6, ..., turn 40:1, turn 41: gone? No.\n\nBetter to think: at turn t, life span L, it will disappear after turn t + L - 1? Let's see:\n\n- At turn t, life span L, it can be eaten on this turn.\n\n- After turn t, life span becomes L-1 for turn t+1.\n\n- It disappears when life span reaches 0, so on turn t + L, it is gone.\n\nFor (6,4) at turn 34, life span 4: available on turns 34,35,36,37; gone on turn 38.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5): life span 7, available turns 34 to 40, gone on 41.\n\n(5,4): life span 10, available turns 34 to 43, gone on 44.\n\nNow, I need to plan actions for multiple turns ahead, at least 5 turns. But the answer format is to list actions starting from turn 34 onwards for several turns. Since it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", I should plan a sequence of moves considering the food and risks.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders and (5,6).\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (3,5)\n\nBody: (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nTail is (5,3).\n\nNow, food at: (6,4), (6,5), (5,4)\n\nCurrent head direction is R (right), so from (3,5), moving right would go to (4,5).\n\nPossible moves from (3,5): since direction is R, I can go U, D, R, but not L (left) because that would be instant reverse. Current direction R, so opposite is L, so I cannot move L on next turn. So allowed moves: U, D, R.\n\nNow, let's see the positions around head:\n\n- Right: (4,5) – is this free? Snake body: let's list all occupied cells.\n\nSnake: (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nSo (4,5) is not in the list, so it should be free, unless wall or something. Walls are borders and (5,6), so (4,5) is within bounds, no wall, so free.\n\n- Up: (3,6) – y=6, but y=7 is wall, but (3,6) is not wall? Walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (3,6) is y=6, which is not y=0 or y=7, so it's free. Also not in snake positions.\n\n- Down: (3,4) – y=4, not wall, not in snake positions? Snake has (2,4), (2,3), etc., but (3,4) not listed, so free.\n\n(3,4) is not in the snake positions, so it's empty.\n\nAlso, cannot move left to (2,5) because it's occupied by body and instant reverse is not allowed anyway.\n\nSo from (3,5), possible moves: U to (3,6), D to (3,4), R to (4,5).\n\nNow, I need to think about eating food. Food is at (6,4), (6,5), (5,4).\n\n(6,5) is food, but let's see distances.\n\nAlso, there's a risk: tail reward danger. If head is adjacent to tail and tail has food, eating it kills.\n\nTail is at (5,3). What is adjacent? (5,3) has neighbors: (5,4), (5,2), (6,3), (4,3).\n\n(6,3) is part of snake body, (4,3) might be free? Not listed in snake.\n\nSnake positions: (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (5,3)\n\nSo (4,3) not listed, so free.\n\n(5,4) is food, not snake.\n\n(5,2) not listed, free.\n\nNow, tail is at (5,3), so if head moves to a cell adjacent to (5,3) and that cell has food, but the food is on the tail cell? Tail reward danger is when the food is on the tail cell and head moves there when adjacent.\n\nFrom the rule: \"If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nSo, if tail has food on it, and head is adjacent to tail, then if head moves to tail position to eat the food, after eating, the snake grows, so the tail doesn't move, but since head was adjacent and moves to tail, now the new tail is where the old tail was, but head is on it, so collision.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (5,3), and is there food on (5,3)? Food is at (6,4), (6,5), (5,4), not at (5,3). So no food on tail currently, so no immediate danger.\n\nBut I need to be careful if food spawns there or something, but currently not.\n\nNow, back to possible moves.\n\nI need to plan to eat food while avoiding collisions.\n\nFirst, the food at (6,4) has short life, only 4 turns left, so I might want to eat it soon.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) has 7 turns, (5,4) has 10, so (6,4) is urgent.\n\nFrom head (3,5), how to get to (6,4).\n\n(6,4) is at x=6,y=4.\n\nHead at (3,5), so need to go right and down.\n\nBut there might be obstacles.\n\nLet me sketch the grid mentally.\n\nx from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: borders, and internal at (5,6).\n\nSnake: let's list positions row by row for y from 7 to 0, but since walls at y=0 and y=7, cells from y=1 to 6 are playable, I think. y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y=1 to y=6 are free except borders.\n\nSimilarly x=0 and x=7 walls, so x=1 to x=6 free except internal obstacles.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,6), which is x=5,y=6.\n\nNow snake positions:\n\ny=5: (3,5) head, (2,5)\n\ny=4: (2,4)\n\ny=3: (2,3), (6,3), (5,3) tail? (5,3) is at y=3.\n\nList:\n\n- (3,5) head\n\n- (2,5) body\n\n- (2,4) body\n\n- (2,3) body\n\n- (2,2) body\n\n- (2,1) body\n\n- (3,1) body\n\n- (4,1) body\n\n- (5,1) body\n\n- (6,1) body\n\n- (6,2) body\n\n- (6,3) body\n\n- (5,3) body (tail)\n\nAlso, (5,3) is the tail, but in the list it's last, so when snake moves, tail moves away.\n\nNow food: (6,4), (6,5), (5,4)\n\n(6,4) is at x=6,y=4, but snake has (6,3) and (6,2), etc., but (6,4) is not occupied by snake? Snake positions: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), so (6,4) is free, has food.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) is at x=6,y=5, which is not in snake, so free with food.\n\n(5,4) at x=5,y=4, not in snake, free with food.\n\nNow, internal wall at (5,6), so (5,6) is blocked.\n\nFrom head (3,5), possible moves:\n\n- U: to (3,6). (3,6) is y=6, which is not wall (y=7 is wall, so y=6 is free), no snake, so safe.\n\n- D: to (3,4). (3,4) is free, no snake, no wall.\n\n- R: to (4,5). (4,5) free, no snake, no wall.\n\nI need to think about the path to food.\n\nFirst, to eat (6,4): it's at (6,4). From (3,5), I can go right to (4,5), then to (5,5), then to (6,5), but (6,5) has food, but I want (6,4). From (6,5) I can go down to (6,4), but (6,5) is food, so if I go to (6,5), I eat that food first.\n\n(6,5) is also food, with longer life span.\n\nBut (6,4) has shorter life, so I should prioritize that.\n\nFrom (3,5) to (6,4):\n\nOne path: right to (4,5), then right to (5,5), then down to (5,4), but (5,4) has food, so I might eat it or not, but I want (6,4), so from (5,4) I can go right to (6,4).\n\nBut (5,4) is food, so if I go there, I eat it.\n\nAnother path: from (3,5) down to (3,4), then right to (4,4), then to (5,4), then to (6,4), but again, (5,4) might be eaten.\n\nSince I need to eat (6,4) soon, and it's only 4 turns left, I should head towards it directly.\n\nBut let's see the turns.\n\nCurrent turn 34, (6,4) available until turn 37, so I have 4 turns to eat it: 34,35,36,37.\n\nI can eat it on turn 34 if I can reach it in one move, but from (3,5) to (6,4) is not adjacent; it's diagonal, not possible. Moves are only horizontal/vertical adjacent.\n\nDistance: |dx|=3, |dy|=1, so min moves: 3 moves, e.g., right, right, down or down, right, right, etc.\n\nBut from (3,5), to (6,4), I need to go east then south or south then east.\n\nBut with obstacles.\n\nFirst, what cells are occupied.\n\nAlso, when I move, the snake body moves, so the tail moves, freeing up cells.\n\nI need to simulate the snake movement.\n\nSince I need to think 5+ turns ahead, I should consider possible paths.\n\nFirst, let's list the free cells around.\n\nI can consider the grid state.\n\nBut it might change.\n\nSince the food at (6,4) is urgent, I should aim to eat it within the next few turns.\n\nFrom (3,5), if I go right to (4,5), then on turn 35, head at (4,5).\n\nFrom (4,5), possible moves: U to (4,6), D to (4,4), L to (3,5) but (3,5) is now body? After moving to (4,5), the new head is (4,5), body includes (3,5), (2,5), etc., but tail moves.\n\nWhen snake moves, the head moves to new position, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment ahead, tail is removed.\n\nSo after move from (3,5) to new position, the segment that was at (3,5) becomes body, but the tail (5,3) is removed, and new tail is where the second last was? Let's think.\n\nSnake positions: [head, seg1, seg2, ..., tail]\n\nAfter move, new head is the new position, then the old head becomes seg1, old seg1 becomes seg2, ..., old tail is removed.\n\nSo the snake shortens temporarily if no food eaten, but since we eat food, it grows.\n\nBut when moving without eating, the tail moves away.\n\nFor path planning, I need to consider the free cells.\n\nFrom (3,5), if I go R to (4,5) on turn 34.\n\nThen new snake positions: head (4,5), body: (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) — tail is (6,3)? Original positions had 13 segments, after move without eating, new snake has 12 segments? No.\n\nOriginal: 13 positions.\n\nAfter moving head to new cell, if no food eaten, the tail is removed, so new snake has head at new position, then the first 12 positions of old snake minus tail? Standard snake: when head moves to new cell, if no food, tail is removed, so the body segments shift, new tail is the previous second last.\n\nIn this case, old snake: positions P0=(3,5), P1=(2,5), P2=(2,4), P3=(2,3), P4=(2,2), P5=(2,1), P6=(3,1), P7=(4,1), P8=(5,1), P9=(6,1), P10=(6,2), P11=(6,3), P12=(5,3) — P12 is tail.\n\nAfter moving head to (4,5), new head is (4,5), then the body becomes: old P0 which is (3,5) as first body segment, then old P1 (2,5), old P2 (2,4), ..., up to old P11 (6,3) as the new tail? Old P11 is (6,3), and old P12 (5,3) is removed.\n\nSo new snake: head (4,5), body: (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) — so tail is (6,3).\n\nLength 13, but since no food eaten, it should be length 12 now? I think I confused.\n\nNumber of segments: if no food eaten, when head moves, tail is removed, so length decreases by 1? No.\n\nInitial length L.\n\nAfter move to new cell with no food: new head position, and the body from segment 1 to L-1, so length L-1? That can't be right.\n\nI think I have a mistake.\n\nStandard snake: the snake has a fixed length unless it eats food.\n\nWhen it moves, the head goes to a new cell, and the tail cell is vacated, so the snake effectively moves forward, length remains the same if no food.\n\nPositions: let's say at time t, snake is [H, B1, B2, ..., T] with H head, T tail.\n\nAfter moving to a new cell N:\n\n- If N has no food, new snake is [N, H, B1, B2, ..., B_{k-1}] where B_{k-1} is the new tail, and T is removed. So length same, but positions shifted.\n\nIn this case, from [P0, P1, P2, ..., P12] with P0 head, P12 tail.\n\nAfter move to new cell Q:\n\nNew head Q, then P0 becomes first body, P1 second body, ..., P11 becomes the last body (new tail), P12 is removed.\n\nSo the new snake has positions: [Q, P0, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, P10, P11] and P12 is free now.\n\nIn this case, P0=(3,5), P1=(2,5), P2=(2,4), P3=(2,3), P4=(2,2), P5=(2,1), P6=(3,1), P7=(4,1), P8=(5,1), P9=(6,1), P10=(6,2), P11=(6,3), P12=(5,3)\n\nAfter moving head to (4,5), new head (4,5), new body: P0=(3,5), P1=(2,5), P2=(2,4), P3=(2,3), P4=(2,2), P5=(2,1), P6=(3,1), P7=(4,1), P8=(5,1), P9=(6,1), P10=(6,2), P11=(6,3) — so new tail is (6,3).\n\nP12=(5,3) is removed, so (5,3) is free now.\n\nSimilarly, if food eaten, length increases, tail not removed.\n\nBack to turn 34.\n\nFrom head (3,5), I want to go to (6,4).\n\nOne way: go right to (4,5) on turn 34.\n\nThen on turn 35, head at (4,5).\n\nFrom (4,5), possible moves: U to (4,6), D to (4,4), L to (3,5) but (3,5) is now body, so cannot move there, and also instant reverse? Current direction: after moving R to (4,5), the new head direction is R, so moving L would be reverse, not allowed. So cannot go L.\n\nCan go U, D, R.\n\nR to (5,5): (5,5) is free? No snake, no wall. Walls: (5,6) is wall, but (5,5) is y=5, free.\n\nSo can go R to (5,5).\n\nD to (4,4), free.\n\nU to (4,6), free.\n\nNow, to reach (6,4), from (4,5), I can go D to (4,4), then on turn 36 to (5,4) or (4,3), etc.\n\n(5,4) has food, so if I go to (5,4), I eat it, but I might want to save it or eat (6,4) first.\n\n(6,4) is more urgent.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can go R to (5,5), then on turn 36 to (6,5) or (5,6) or (5,4).\n\n(5,6) is wall, so cannot.\n\n(6,5) has food, (5,4) has food.\n\nIf I go to (6,5) on turn 36, I eat that food.\n\nThen from (6,5), I can go D to (6,4) on turn 37 to eat it.\n\nSimilarly, if I go directly to (4,4) on turn 35, then to (5,4) on turn 36, eat (5,4), then to (6,4) on turn 37.\n\nBut (5,4) has longer life, so I can eat it later.\n\nSince (6,4) disappears after turn 37, I need to eat it by turn 37.\n\nTurn 37 is the last chance.\n\nSo I need to be at (6,4) on or before turn 37.\n\nFrom current turn 34, I have turns 34,35,36,37 to move to it.\n\nBut I can only move one step per turn.\n\nSo the head must be at (6,4) on one of these turns.\n\nNow, distance: from (3,5) to (6,4), dx=3, dy=1, so Manhattan distance 4, so I can reach it in 3 or 4 moves.\n\nFor example, in 3 moves: e.g., right, right, down; or down, right, right; etc.\n\nBut with the body moving, it might be blocked.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nOption 1: Turn 34: R to (4,5)\n\nThen turn 35: from (4,5), R to (5,5)  (since direction R, can go R)\n\nThen turn 36: from (5,5), D to (5,4) or R to (6,5)\n\nIf I go R to (6,5), I eat food at (6,5) on turn 36.\n\nThen on turn 37, from (6,5), I can go D to (6,4) to eat (6,4).\n\nSimilarly, if on turn 36 from (5,5) I go D to (5,4), eat (5,4), then on turn 37 to (6,4) if possible.\n\nBut (6,4) from (5,4) is adjacent right, so yes.\n\nBut in this case, I eat either (6,5) or (5,4) on the way.\n\nSince all food is positive, eating is good, but I need to avoid risks.\n\nAnother option: from (3,5) on turn 34 go D to (3,4)\n\nThen turn 35: head at (3,4), direction D (since moved down).\n\nFrom (3,4), possible moves: L, R, D (not U, reverse).\n\nL to (2,4): (2,4) is body? After turn 34 move to (3,4), new snake: head (3,4), body (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), ..., tail.\n\nOld head (3,5) is now body, so (2,4) is still body? Let's compute.\n\nAfter turn 34 move D to (3,4):\n\nNew head (3,4), new body: old head (3,5), then old P1 (2,5), old P2 (2,4), old P3 (2,3), old P4 (2,2), old P5 (2,1), old P6 (3,1), old P7 (4,1), old P8 (5,1), old P9 (6,1), old P10 (6,2), old P11 (6,3) — tail is (6,3)? Old tail was P12=(5,3), removed.\n\nNew body: [ (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) ] so tail (6,3)\n\n(2,4) is occupied by body.\n\nFrom (3,4), moves:\n\n- L to (2,4): but (2,4) is body, so collision, cannot.\n\n- R to (4,4): (4,4) is free? Not in snake, no wall, so free.\n\n- D to (3,3): (3,3) free? Not in snake positions above, so free.\n\n- U to (3,5): but (3,5) is body, and instant reverse? Current direction after move to (3,4) is D, so U is reverse, not allowed.\n\nSo possible: R to (4,4) or D to (3,3).\n\nTo reach (6,4), from (3,4), go R to (4,4) on turn 35.\n\nThen from (4,4), on turn 36, can go R to (5,4) or U to (4,5) or D to (4,3), etc.\n\nIf go R to (5,4), eat food at (5,4).\n\nThen on turn 37 to (6,4).\n\nSimilarly, I can reach (6,4) by turn 37.\n\nNow, the issue is the tail reward danger or other risks.\n\nFor example, when I move to (6,4), what is the state.\n\nBut first, I need to choose the first move.\n\nAlso, there is food at (6,5) which I might eat or not.\n\nBut (6,4) is urgent, so I should go for it.\n\nMoreover, after eating, the snake grows, so I need to be careful of space.\n\nAnother thing: the internal wall at (5,6) might block some paths.\n\nBut for now, let's assume I go for the path to eat (6,4) by turn 37.\n\nNow, which path is safer?\n\nFrom (3,5), if I go R to (4,5) on turn 34.\n\nThen turn 35: from (4,5), I can go R to (5,5) to avoid eating food yet, or D to (4,4), or U to (4,6).\n\nIf I go R to (5,5), then turn 36: from (5,5), can go R to (6,5) or D to (5,4).\n\nIf I go R to (6,5) on turn 36, eat (6,5), then snake grows, so after eating, tail not removed.\n\nThen on turn 37, from (6,5), go D to (6,4) to eat it.\n\nWhen I go to (6,4), is there risk?\n\nFirst, on turn 36, head at (6,5), after eating (6,5), the snake grows, so the tail does not move, so the body is longer.\n\nBut let's simulate positions.\n\nStart turn 34: head (3,5)\n\nMove R to (4,5), no eat, so new snake: head (4,5), body (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) tail (6,3)\n\nP12 (5,3) removed, so (5,3) free.\n\nTurn 35: move R to (5,5), no food at (5,5)? Food at (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), not (5,5), so no eat.\n\nNew head (5,5), new body: old head (4,5), then (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) — tail (6,2)? New body: [ (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) ] and old tail (6,3) removed? Old tail was (6,3), so removed, new tail is last of new body, which is (6,2)? Positions: new body segments: first body (4,5), second (3,5), third (2,5), fourth (2,4), fifth (2,3), sixth (2,2), seventh (2,1), eighth (3,1), ninth (4,1), tenth (5,1), eleventh (6,1), twelfth (6,2) — so tail is (6,2).\n\n(6,3) removed.\n\nTurn 36: move R to (6,5). (6,5) has food, value 1, so eat it.\n\nNew head (6,5), since food eaten, tail not removed, so new body is [old head (5,5), then the entire old body: (4,5), (3,5), ..., (6,2) ]\n\nAfter move to (6,5) with eat, new snake: head (6,5), then the old head (5,5) as first body, then the old body segments: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) — and since ate, no removal, so tail is (6,2), but now length increased to 14 segments.\n\nOld snake had 13 segments, after move with eat, head to new position, and all old positions remain, so length L+1.\n\nSo positions: new head (6,5), then old positions: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) — so tail is (6,2).\n\n(6,3) was removed earlier, not part of body.\n\nNow, food at (6,5) eaten, so removed.\n\nTurn 37: from (6,5), I want to go D to (6,4) to eat the food there.\n\n(6,4) has food, value 1.\n\nNow, move D to (6,4).\n\nFirst, is it possible? Current position (6,5), direction down? After moving R to (6,5), direction is R, so moving D is not reverse, allowed.\n\n(6,4) is free? Currently, snake has (6,1), (6,2), (6,5), but not (6,4), so free.\n\nAlso, walls: x=6 is border wall? x=7 is wall, x=6 is not wall, y=4 not wall.\n\nSo (6,4) is free.\n\nMove to (6,4), eat food.\n\nNew head (6,4), with eat, so new body: old head (6,5), then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) — tail (6,2).\n\nNow, I ate both (6,5) and (6,4), good.\n\nBut is there any risk?\n\nOn turn 37, when moving to (6,4), the tail is at (6,2), not adjacent, so no tail reward danger.\n\n(6,2) is tail, head at (6,5), moving to (6,4), which is not adjacent to tail (6,2), so fine.\n\nNow, but I have food at (5,4) still, with life span 10, so I can eat it later.\n\nNow, what about the first move: I need to output actions.\n\nIn this sequence, I moved R on turn 34, R on 35, R on 36 to (6,5), D on 37 to (6,4).\n\nBut on turn 35, from (4,5), I went R to (5,5), but I could go D to (4,4) instead.\n\nBut in this case, I reached (6,4) on turn 37.\n\nFrom (3,5), if I go D first to (3,4) on turn 34.\n\nThen turn 35: from (3,4), go R to (4,4) (since cannot go L to (2,4) body, and U reverse not allowed).\n\nThen turn 36: from (4,4), go R to (5,4), eat (5,4).\n\nThen turn 37: from (5,4), go R to (6,4), eat (6,4).\n\nAlso reaches on turn 37.\n\nBut in this case, I eat (5,4) on turn 36, which has longer life, but I eat it earlier, which is fine, since it's positive.\n\nBut perhaps the first path is shorter or something.\n\nIn terms of risk, both seem ok.\n\nBut let's check the area around (5,4).\n\nIn the first path, when I go to (5,5) on turn 35, (5,5) is free, no issue.\n\nBut (5,5) is close to wall at (5,6), but since (5,6) is wall, I cannot go there, but from (5,5), I can go to (6,5) or (5,4).\n\n(5,4) has food, but I didn't go there in that sequence.\n\nNow, another thing: after eating, the snake is longer, so I need to avoid trapping myself.\n\nFor example, after turn 37, in first sequence, snake has head at (6,4), body including (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), ..., down to (6,2).\n\nThe grid has walls, and internal obstacle.\n\nFree cells: for example, from (6,4), I can go L to (5,4) but (5,4) has food, but I might not want to eat immediately, or U to (6,5) but (6,5) is body now, or D to (6,3), but (6,3) might be free or not.\n\nIn current state after turn 37 eat, positions: head (6,4), body: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) — tail (6,2).\n\nSo (6,3) is free? Not occupied, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4) is free with food.\n\n(4,4) free, etc.\n\nFrom (6,4), possible moves: U to (6,5) but body, collision; D to (6,3), free; L to (5,4), free with food; R to (7,4) but x=7 wall, cannot.\n\nSo can go D or L.\n\nIf go L to (5,4), eat food, grow.\n\nOr go D to (6,3), no eat.\n\nBut I need to think beyond.\n\nSince the question is to output actions for several turns, starting from turn 34.\n\nBut I need to specify multiple turns.\n\nThe answer format is to list actions for turn 34, 35, 36, etc.\n\nBut how many? At least 5 turns ahead? Or as needed.\n\nSince I have a plan to eat (6,4) by turn 37, I can output up to turn 37.\n\nBut let's see the life span of other food.\n\n(6,5) I ate on turn 36, good.\n\n(5,4) still there, life span 10, so I have time.\n\nNow, for the first move, I should choose.\n\nBut there might be a risk with the tail or something.\n\nAnother point: in the initial position, the tail is at (5,3), and there is food at (5,4), which is adjacent to tail.\n\nBut head is not adjacent to tail, so no danger.\n\nIf I move such that head becomes adjacent to tail when tail has food, but tail has no food now.\n\nAfter moves, tail moves.\n\nFor example, in the sequence where I go to (5,4), on turn 36, if I eat (5,4), and tail is somewhere.\n\nIn the second path: turn 34 D to (3,4)\n\nNew head (3,4), body (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), ..., (6,3) tail? Similar to before, tail (6,3) after move.\n\nTurn 35: R to (4,4), no eat? (4,4) no food, so new head (4,4), body (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) tail (6,2)? Let's not simulate all.\n\nThen turn 36: R to (5,4), eat food.\n\nNew head (5,4), with eat, so new body: old head (4,4), then all old body, so (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) — and tail (6,2)? Length increased.\n\nThen turn 37: from (5,4), go R to (6,4), eat.\n\nNew head (6,4), with eat, body: (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) — tail (6,2).\n\n(6,3) was free earlier, not occupied.\n\nNow, when moving to (6,4) on turn 37, tail is at (6,2), head at (5,4), distance not adjacent, so fine.\n\nBoth sequences work to eat (6,4) by turn 37.\n\nNow, which one to choose? Perhaps the first one where I go right initially, so I can eat (6,5) as well, which has shorter life than (5,4)? (6,5) life span 7, (5,4) life span 10, so (6,5) disappears earlier if not eaten, but I ate it.\n\nIn first sequence, I ate (6,5) on turn 36, which is fine.\n\nIn second sequence, I ate (5,4) on turn 36, which has longer life, but eating it earlier is ok.\n\nBut in terms of score, all +1, same.\n\nNow, risk: in the first sequence, when I was at (5,5) on turn 35, (5,5) is surrounded? (5,6) is wall, so from (5,5), I can only go to (6,5), (5,4), or (4,5) but (4,5) is body, cannot, or (5,6) wall.\n\nSo only two choices: R or D.\n\nI went R to (6,5).\n\nSimilarly, in the second sequence, no such issue.\n\nBut both seem fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the grid after eating.\n\nAnother food: (5,4) is still there, I can eat it later.\n\nBut let's think about survival.\n\nAfter eating both, the snake is longer, and the area might be cramped.\n\nFor example, in first sequence after turn 37, head at (6,4), body down to (6,2), and left to (2,1), etc.\n\nFree cells: for example, (1,5), (1,4), etc., but also (4,4), (3,4), (5,3), etc.\n\nFrom (6,4), I can go L to (5,4) to eat the food, or D to (6,3).\n\n(6,3) is free, as in earlier simulation.\n\nIf I go to (6,3), no eat, then I can go to other places.\n\nBut I need to maximize score, so I should eat the food when possible, but not if risky.\n\n(5,4) is safe to eat.\n\nBut let's see tail reward danger.\n\nSuppose I go to (5,4) from (6,4).\n\nBut tail is at (6,2), not adjacent to (5,4).\n\n(5,4) and (6,2) are not adjacent, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, other positions.\n\nPerhaps I should output the actions.\n\nBut I need to decide the first move.\n\nSince the head direction is R, moving R might be natural.\n\nAlso, going down to (3,4) might lead to the left area, which has the body, but it can be navigated.\n\nBut to save time, I'll go with the first plan.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 34: R (right to (4,5))\n\nThen turn 35: R (right to (5,5))\n\nThen turn 36: R (right to (6,5), eat food)\n\nThen turn 37: D (down to (6,4), eat food)\n\nNow, for turn 38, I need to think, but since the answer might not require all, but to think ahead.\n\nAfter turn 37, I have food at (5,4) still, with life span decreasing, but 10 turns, so I can go to eat it.\n\nFor example, from (6,4) on turn 37, after moving to (6,4), head at (6,4), direction D.\n\nThen possible moves: L to (5,4) or D to (6,3) or U to (6,5) but body, cannot; R to wall, cannot.\n\nSo L or D.\n\nIf I go L to (5,4), I eat the food immediately.\n\nThen snake grows further.\n\nBut is it safe? Tail is at (6,2), head moves to (5,4), not adjacent, so no collision.\n\nAfter eating, new head (5,4), body includes (6,4), (6,5), etc.\n\nThen I can move to other free cells, like (5,3) or (4,4), etc.\n\n(5,3) might be free, or not.\n\nIn the state, after turn 37, positions include (6,2), (6,1), etc., but (5,3) not occupied, so free.\n\nSimilarly, (4,4) free.\n\nSo I can go to (5,3) or (4,4).\n\nBut to avoid risks, moving to (5,4) is fine.\n\nSince the problem is to think 5+ turns ahead, and current turn 34, I should plan up to turn 39 or so.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have up to turn 37, which is 4 turns from 34? Turn 34 action, then 35,36,37, so 4 actions.\n\nTurn 34: action for turn 34, then turn 35, etc.\n\nFrom turn 34 to 37 is 4 turns: actions on t34, t35, t36, t37.\n\nBut thinking ahead, I should consider what to do after.\n\nBut for answer, I can list these.\n\nI need to output the actions.\n\nPerhaps for turn 34, I should go R.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is a better move.\n\nAnother option: from (3,5), go U to (3,6) on turn 34.\n\nBut (3,6) is away from the food, and (6,4) might expire, so not good.\n\nSimilarly, go D to (3,4), then as before.\n\nBut going R directly towards the food seems better.\n\nMoreover, in the R path, I eat (6,5) which has medium life span.\n\n(6,5) life span 7, at turn 34, if not eaten, it disappears at turn 41, but I eat it on turn 36, fine.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think R on turn 34 is good.\n\nThen for the sequence.\n\nBut in turn 35, from (4,5), I have choices, but in the plan I go R to (5,5).\n\nI could go D to (4,4), but that might not be necessary.\n\nFor example, if I go D to (4,4) on turn 35, then from (4,4), I can go R to (5,4) on turn 36, eat, then to (6,4) on turn 37.\n\nBut then I eat (5,4) earlier, which has longer life, but I can eat it later if I want.\n\nBut since all are +1, no difference.\n\nBut in terms of space, after eating (5,4), the snake is longer earlier, might be tighter.\n\nBut in the first sequence, I eat (6,5) and (6,4) first, then (5,4) later.\n\n(5,4) is at (5,4), which is closer to the body.\n\nIn the state after turn 37 in first sequence, head at (6,4), (5,4) is adjacent and free, so I can eat it immediately on turn 38.\n\nThen move away.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with:\n\nTurn 34: R\n\nTurn 35: R\n\nTurn 36: R\n\nTurn 37: D\n\nFor turn 38, if I want to continue, but perhaps not necessary.\n\nTo think ahead, after turn 37, head at (6,4), direction D, so on turn 38, I can go L to (5,4) to eat the food, or D to (6,3).\n\nSince (5,4) is food and I can eat it safely, I should, to gain score.\n\nThen after eating, head at (5,4), then I can go to (5,3) or (4,4), etc.\n\nBut for the answer, I can stop at turn 37 or add turn 38.\n\nThe problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but output format is to list actions starting from current turn.\n\nSince current turn is 34, and I think 4 turns to 37, but 37 is 3 turns ahead? Let's see.\n\nTurn 34: action for this turn.\n\nAfter action, turn 35, etc.\n\nSo from turn 34 to turn 37, there are 4 actions: t34, t35, t36, t37.\n\nt34 to t37 is 4 turns.\n\nI can add one more to make 5.\n\nFor example, on turn 38, from (6,4), go L to (5,4).\n\nBut in the sequence, after turn 37, head at (6,4), so turn 38: L to (5,4).\n\nBut I need to specify.\n\nSince the food at (5,4) has long life, I could avoid eating it now to have space, but since it's positive, eating gives score, so I should eat when possible.\n\nBut to avoid potential trap, but here seems fine.\n\nSo for completeness, I can add.\n\nBut in the answer, I think listing up to turn 37 is ok, as I have a plan for the urgent food.\n\nBut to be safe, let's output 5 turns.\n\nTurn 34: R\n\nTurn 35: R\n\nTurn 36: R\n\nTurn 37: D\n\nThen turn 38: L (to (5,4))\n\nBut on turn 37, after moving D to (6,4), head at (6,4), direction D.\n\nThen on turn 38, moving L to (5,4) is allowed, since not reverse; reverse of D would be U, but L is perpendicular.\n\nCurrent direction D, so moving L (left) is not opposite, opposite is U.\n\nSo allowed.\n\nThen eat (5,4).\n\nNow, all food eaten.\n\nThen the snake can move to other areas.\n\nBut I think for the answer, I'll list the actions.\n\nIn the initial, when I go to (5,5) on turn 35, (5,5) is below the internal wall at (5,6), but no issue.\n\nAnother point: in the body, when I move, the tail moves, freeing cells.\n\nBut in this case, no problem.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, the strategy prioritizes eating the positive food at (6,4) due to its short remaining life span (4 turns, including turn 34). This food must be eaten by turn 37 to avoid loss. The plan involves moving right immediately to position the snake for efficient access to (6,4), while also considering the other food items at (6,5) and (5,4) with longer life spans. The sequence below ensures the snake eats (6,4) by turn 37 and (6,5) by turn 36, with (5,4) eaten on turn 38 for additional score. Risks, such as collisions with walls, body segments, or tail reward danger, are avoided by choosing safe paths and considering the snake's growth.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n- **Food Urgency**: (6,4) has only 4 turns of life left (disappears after turn 37), making it the top priority. (6,5) has 7 turns (disappears after turn 40) and (5,4) has 10 turns (disappears after turn 43), allowing more flexibility.\n- **Movement Safety**: \n  - Current head direction is right (R), so instant reverse (left, L) is forbidden on turn 34.\n  - Wall collisions are avoided by staying within bounds (x=1-6, y=1-6 except internal obstacle at (5,6)).\n  - Body collisions are checked at each step based on simulated snake positions.\n  - Tail reward danger is irrelevant here, as no food is on the tail initially or during the sequence.\n- **Path Efficiency**: \n  - From (3,5), moving right (R) on turn 34 positions the snake closer to (6,4) and (6,5).\n  - Eating (6,5) on turn 36 provides score and does not block access to (6,4).\n  - Eating (5,4) on turn 38 is safe after (6,4) is consumed, with ample life span remaining.\n- **5+ Turn Lookahead**: The plan covers 5 turns (turns 34-38) to ensure (6,4) is eaten safely, (6,5) is utilized, and (5,4) is addressed. After turn 38, the snake can explore other areas for additional food or survival.\n\n### Simulated Sequence:\n- **Turn 34 (current turn)**: \n  - Move R to (4,5). \n  - Reason: Moves toward (6,4) efficiently, avoids instant reverse, and keeps options open. No food eaten; snake length unchanged. New head direction: R.\n- **Turn 35**: \n  - Move R to (5,5). \n  - Reason: Continues path to (6,5) and (6,4). (5,5) is free (no wall or body). No food at (5,5), so no eat. New head direction: R.\n- **Turn 36**: \n  - Move R to (6,5). \n  - Reason: Eats food at (6,5) (value +1), increasing snake length by 1. (6,5) is free and safe. New head direction: R.\n- **Turn 37**: \n  - Move D to (6,4). \n  - Reason: Eats food at (6,4) (value +1) just before it disappears, increasing length. (6,4) is free; moving down from (6,5) is allowed (not reverse). New head direction: D.\n- **Turn 38**: \n  - Move L to (5,4). \n  - Reason: Eats food at (5,4) (value +1) for additional score. (5,4) is free and safe; moving left from (6,4) is allowed (perpendicular, not reverse). New head direction: L.\n\n### Verification:\n- **Risk Avoidance**:\n  - No wall collisions: All moves stay within x=1-6, y=1-6, avoiding (5,6).\n  - No body collisions: Simulated positions show no head-body contact (e.g., on turn 37, body includes (6,5) and (5,5), but head moves to (6,4), not adjacent to body except the previous head, which moves away).\n  - No tail reward danger: Tail is never adjacent to head when food is eaten (e.g., on turn 36, tail is at (6,2) when eating at (6,5); on turn 37, tail at (6,2) when eating at (6,4); on turn 38, tail at (6,1) or similar when eating at (5,4)).\n- **Food Consumption**: \n  - (6,5) eaten on turn 36 (life span sufficient).\n  - (6,4) eaten on turn 37 (within 4-turn window).\n  - (5,4) eaten on turn 38 (life span ample, no rush).\n- **Long-Term Survival**: After turn 38, the snake is longer but has space to maneuver (e.g., move to (5,3), (4,4), or other free cells). The sequence avoids dead ends and maintains flexibility.\n\nThis plan scores +3 (all positive food) by turn 38 with minimal risk. Beyond this, the snake should navigate open areas (e.g., left or down from (5,4)) to find more food or avoid traps.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 34: R (right)  \nTurn 35: R (right)  \nTurn 36: R (right)  \nTurn 37: D (down)  \nTurn 38: L (left)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 35. The grid has walls at the borders: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. Also, there's an internal obstacle at (5,6). So, the playable area is from x=1 to x=6 and y=1 to y=6, except for the obstacle at (5,6).\n\nSnake positions: Head is at (4,5), and the body segments follow: (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). The head direction is R (right), meaning it was moving to the right to reach (4,5) from (3,5)? Let's see the positions: from head to tail: (4,5) is head, then (3,5), (2,5), etc. Since head direction is R, and it's at (4,5), that means it came from (3,5) to (4,5) by moving right. So current head position is (4,5), and it's facing right.\n\nFood items:\n\n- (6,4) with life span 3, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (6,5) with life span 6, value 1 (positive)\n\n- (5,4) with life span 9, value 1 (positive)\n\nAll food is positive, no negative food here. Value is 1 for all, and life span decreases each turn.\n\nLife span: for (6,4), life span 3, meaning it will disappear after 3 more turns, including the current turn? Let me check the rules.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for food at (6,4), life_span=3, so after turn 35, 36, 37, it will disappear before turn 38. Countdown decreases every turn, including current, so at turn 35, life_span=3, meaning it has 3 turns left including this one. After turn 35, it will have 2 left, and so on, until after turn 37, it has 0 and disappears.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) has life_span=6, so it will last until after turn 40 (35+5=40? Let's calculate: turn 35: life=6, turn 36:5, ..., turn 40:1, turn 41:0 gone? Life span N, disappears after N turns, meaning it exists for N turns including the current one if we start counting from now.\n\nBetter to think: at turn t, life_span = L means it will disappear after L more turns, so it can be eaten on turns t to t+L-1 inclusive. For example, L=3 at t=35: can be eaten on turns 35,36,37. Gone by turn 38.\n\nSimilarly, L=6 at t=35: can be eaten on turns 35 to 40. Gone turn 41.\n\nL=9 at t=35: can be eaten turns 35 to 43. Gone turn 44.\n\nNow, snake head at (4,5), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U (up, to (4,6)), D (down, to (4,4)), L (left, to (3,5)), R (right, to (5,5)).\n\nBut cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is R, so opposite is L (left). So cannot move left to (3,5) because that's where the body is, and also opposite direction.\n\nNo instant reverse rule: cannot move opposite to current direction on next turn. Current direction is R, so cannot move L (left).\n\nSo possible moves: U, D, R.\n\nNow, moving to these cells:\n\n- U to (4,6): is this within bounds? Walls: border x=0/x=7, y=0/y=7, so y=6 is the top row? y=0 and y=7 are walls, so y from 1 to 6 is playable. y=6 is the top row, not wall. Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=1 to y=6 are free, except obstacles.\n\n(4,6): x=4, y=6. Not a wall, and no internal obstacle mentioned except (5,6), so (4,6) should be free.\n\nBut is it occupied? Snake positions: let's list all occupied cells.\n\nSnake: (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\nSo (4,6) is not in this list, so empty.\n\nSimilarly, D to (4,4): (4,4) not in snake positions, so empty.\n\nR to (5,5): (5,5) not in snake positions? Positions: head (4,5), then (3,5), etc. (5,5) is not listed, so should be empty.\n\nBut there is an obstacle at (5,6), but (5,5) is different.\n\nNow, food is at (6,4), (6,5), (5,4).\n\n(5,4) is food, (6,4) food, (6,5) food.\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nFirst, let's see the grid layout.\n\nGrid size: walls at x=0,7 and y=0,7, so playable area: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6. But internal obstacle at (5,6), so (5,6) is blocked.\n\nSo available cells: all except walls and (5,6).\n\nNow snake body: from (4,5) to (6,3), as listed.\n\nTail is at (6,3), I think. Positions: index 0: head (4,5), 1: (3,5), 2: (2,5), 3: (2,4), 4: (2,3), 5: (2,2), 6: (2,1), 7: (3,1), 8: (4,1), 9: (5,1), 10: (6,1), 11: (6,2), 12: (6,3). So 13 segments, tail at (6,3).\n\nIf snake eats food, it grows, so length increases by 1 for positive food.\n\nNow, possible moves from (4,5):\n\n- U to (4,6)\n\n- D to (4,4)\n\n- R to (5,5)\n\nCannot L to (3,5) because it's occupied by body and also opposite direction.\n\n(3,5) is the first body segment, so moving there would cause collision, since head touches body immediately. But according to rules, body collision is deadly, except for the tail, because tail moves.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, if head moves to a cell that is currently occupied by tail, it's ok because tail moves away.\n\nBut in this case, (3,5) is not tail; tail is at (6,3). So moving to (3,5) would be body collision.\n\nSimilarly, (2,5), etc., all body except tail.\n\nTail is at (6,3), which is not adjacent to head directly.\n\nHead at (4,5), adjacent cells: up (4,6), down (4,4), left (3,5), right (5,5).\n\n(3,5) is body, so moving left is invalid due to collision and also opposite direction.\n\n(5,5) is empty, (4,6) empty, (4,4) empty.\n\nNow, food at (5,4), (6,4), (6,5).\n\n(5,4) is down-right from head? Head at (4,5), (5,4) is down and right, not adjacent directly.\n\nAdjacent cells are only U, D, L, R, not diagonal.\n\nSo from (4,5), to reach (5,4), need to go right then down, or down then right, etc.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) is further right, (6,5) up-right.\n\nSince I need to think ahead, let's consider the options.\n\nFirst, if I move right to (5,5), what happens?\n\nTurn 35: move R to (5,5). Head now at (5,5), snake grows? No, because no food there. Food is at (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), not at (5,5). So just move, tail moves to (6,2)? Let's see new positions.\n\nAfter move R to (5,5): head moves to (5,5), body: the segment that was at (3,5) moves to where? Snake movement: when head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo positions: old head (4,5) becomes body, new head (5,5). Then the segment that was at (3,5) moves to (4,5), and so on, down to tail.\n\nOld positions: indices: 0:(4,5), 1:(3,5), 2:(2,5), 3:(2,4), 4:(2,3), 5:(2,2), 6:(2,1), 7:(3,1), 8:(4,1), 9:(5,1), 10:(6,1), 11:(6,2), 12:(6,3)\n\nAfter moving R to (5,5): new head at (5,5), then body: position 0 was (4,5), now becomes body segment 1 at (4,5)? No.\n\nTypically: new head is (5,5). Then the old head (4,5) is now the first body segment. Then the segment that was at index 1, (3,5), moves to where the head was, (4,5). Then segment that was at (2,5) moves to (3,5), and so on. The tail segment moves to where the previous tail was, but since no growth, the last segment is removed? No.\n\nWhen no food eaten, the snake moves forward: head to new position, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail position is vacated.\n\nSo new positions: head: (5,5)\n\nThen body: segment 1: (4,5)  // old head position\n\nSegment 2: (3,5)  // where segment 1 was\n\nSegment 3: (2,5)  // where segment 2 was\n\nSegment 4: (2,4)  // where segment 3 was\n\nSegment 5: (2,3)  // where segment 4 was\n\nSegment 6: (2,2)  // where segment 5 was\n\nSegment 7: (2,1)  // where segment 6 was? Old position 6 is (2,1), which moves to where position 5 was? Let's think indices.\n\nOld positions: let's number them from head to tail: S0: (4,5), S1: (3,5), S2: (2,5), S3: (2,4), S4: (2,3), S5: (2,2), S6: (2,1), S7: (3,1), S8: (4,1), S9: (5,1), S10: (6,1), S11: (6,2), S12: (6,3)\n\nAfter move to (5,5) with no eat:\n\nNew S0: (5,5)  // new head\n\nNew S1: old S0 = (4,5)  // now body\n\nNew S2: old S1 = (3,5)\n\nNew S3: old S2 = (2,5)\n\nNew S4: old S3 = (2,4)\n\nNew S5: old S4 = (2,3)\n\nNew S6: old S5 = (2,2)\n\nNew S7: old S6 = (2,1)  // (2,1) moved to where? When the snake moves, each segment from head to tail updates.\n\nS1 moves to where S0 was, which is (4,5)\n\nS2 moves to where S1 was, which is (3,5)\n\n...\n\nS7 moves to where S6 was? S6 was at (2,1), and S7 was at (3,1), so S7 moves to where S6 was, which is (2,1).\n\nThen S8 moves to where S7 was, (3,1)\n\nS9 to where S8 was, (4,1)\n\nS10 to where S9 was, (5,1)\n\nS11 to where S10 was, (6,1)\n\nS12 to where S11 was, (6,2)\n\nAnd the old tail position (6,3) is vacated, since no growth.\n\nSo new positions: head (5,5), then (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nTail at (6,2)\n\nNow, head at (5,5), direction was R, so now facing right.\n\nPossible moves from (5,5): U to (5,6), D to (5,4), L to (4,5), R to (6,5)\n\nBut (5,6) is obstacle? Internal obstacle at (5,6), so (5,6) is wall, cannot move there.\n\n(4,5) is now occupied by body? In new positions, (4,5) is S1, the first body segment. So moving left to (4,5) would be body collision.\n\n(6,5) is a food position? Food at (6,5), but is it occupied? Currently, snake is not there, so (6,5) is free except for food.\n\n(6,5) has food, but snake can move there to eat it.\n\nFirst, let's see possible moves from (5,5):\n\n- U to (5,6): but (5,6) is obstacle, wall, cannot move.\n\n- D to (5,4): (5,4) has food? Food at (5,4), so moving there would eat the food.\n\n- L to (4,5): but (4,5) is occupied by body (S1), so collision, invalid.\n\n- R to (6,5): (6,5) has food, so move and eat.\n\nAlso, cannot move opposite to current direction. Current direction is R, so opposite is L, which is invalid anyway.\n\nSo possible moves: D or R.\n\nIf move D to (5,4), eat food at (5,4), so snake grows: head moves to (5,4), and tail does not move, so new segment added.\n\nAfter eating, head to new position, body follows, but since food eaten, the tail stays, so snake grows by one segment.\n\nNew head at (5,4), then the old head (5,5) becomes body, and so on, down to tail, which remains, so new tail is where the old tail was, but since grown, the segment that was tail stays, and a new segment is added at the tail? No.\n\nStandard snake: when food eaten, head moves to food cell, the body segments move as usual, but the tail does not move, so the snake gains a new segment at the position where the tail was before moving.\n\nAfter move to (5,4) with eat:\n\nNew head: (5,4)\n\nThen new S1: old head (5,5)\n\nThen S2: old S1 (4,5)\n\nS3: old S2 (3,5)\n\nS4: old S3 (2,5)\n\nS5: old S4 (2,4)\n\nS6: old S5 (2,3)\n\nS7: old S6 (2,2)\n\nS8: old S7 (2,1)  // but old S7 was at (3,1)? Let's list old positions after first move.\n\nAfter turn 35 move to (5,5), positions were: S0:(5,5), S1:(4,5), S2:(3,5), S3:(2,5), S4:(2,4), S5:(2,3), S6:(2,2), S7:(2,1), S8:(3,1), S9:(4,1), S10:(5,1), S11:(6,1), S12:(6,2)\n\nTail at (6,2)\n\nNow from here, at turn 36, if move D to (5,4), which has food.\n\nSo eat food: head moves to (5,4), new segment added, so the body: new S0: (5,4)\n\nNew S1: old S0 (5,5)\n\nNew S2: old S1 (4,5)\n\nNew S3: old S2 (3,5)\n\nNew S4: old S3 (2,5)\n\nNew S5: old S4 (2,4)\n\nNew S6: old S5 (2,3)\n\nNew S7: old S6 (2,2)\n\nNew S8: old S7 (2,1)\n\nNew S9: old S8 (3,1)\n\nNew S10: old S9 (4,1)\n\nNew S11: old S10 (5,1)\n\nNew S12: old S11 (6,1)\n\nNew S13: old S12 (6,2)  // new tail, since grown, old tail position is kept.\n\nSo tail at (6,2) still, but now it's S13.\n\nAnd the cell (6,2) was occupied, but since tail moved from there? In this case, old S12 was at (6,2), and it moves to new position, but when growing, the tail doesn't move, so new segment at old tail position.\n\nIn the sequence, new S13 is at old S12 position (6,2), and the segments before move to their next positions.\n\nBut (6,2) is now occupied by S13, and it was vacated when tail moved? I think I'm confusing.\n\nAfter eating, the snake length increases, so the position where the tail was remains occupied, and the new tail is the old tail position.\n\nIn this case, from positions after turn 35 move: S0:(5,5), S1:(4,5), ..., S12:(6,2)\n\nMove to (5,4) with eat: new head at (5,4)\n\nThen S1: old S0 (5,5)\n\nS2: old S1 (4,5)\n\n...\nS12: old S11 (6,1)  // old S11 was at (6,1), moves to where S10 was or what? No.\n\nWhen head moves to new cell with eat, each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the last segment (tail) does not move, so it stays and a new segment is added there.\n\nSo the body segments shift: new S1 = position of old S0\n\nNew S2 = position of old S1\n\n...\nNew S12 = position of old S11\n\nThen new S13 = position of old S12  // since grown, tail stays\n\nIn terms of positions: new S0: (5,4)\n\nNew S1: old S0 position, which is (5,5)\n\nNew S2: old S1 position, (4,5)\n\nNew S3: old S2 position, (3,5)\n\nNew S4: old S3 position, (2,5)\n\nNew S5: old S4 position, (2,4)\n\nNew S6: old S5 position, (2,3)\n\nNew S7: old S6 position, (2,2)\n\nNew S8: old S7 position, (2,1)\n\nNew S9: old S8 position, (3,1)\n\nNew S10: old S9 position, (4,1)\n\nNew S11: old S10 position, (5,1)\n\nNew S12: old S11 position, (6,1)\n\nNew S13: old S12 position, (6,2)  // new tail\n\nSo now tail at (6,2)\n\nAnd the old position (6,2) is still occupied, but by the new tail.\n\nSimilarly, if move R to (6,5) from (5,5), it has food, so eat and grow similarly.\n\nBut let's not get ahead; this is for turn 36.\n\nBack to turn 35.\n\nAt turn 35, from (4,5), options:\n\n- Move U to (4,6)\n\n- Move D to (4,4)\n\n- Move R to (5,5)\n\nI need to think 5+ turns ahead.\n\nAlso, food life spans: (6,4) life 3, so can be eaten on turns 35,36,37\n\n(6,5) life 6, turns 35 to 40\n\n(5,4) life 9, turns 35 to 43\n\nNow, the snake is in the top-right area. Head at (4,5), which is near the center top.\n\nGrid: x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to6.\n\nObstacle at (5,6), so row y=6 has cells (1,6) to (6,6) except (5,6) blocked.\n\ny=6: x=1,2,3,4,6 available, x=5 blocked.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\nSnake body occupies a lot of the left and bottom: from (2,1) to (2,5), then (3,5), (4,5) head, and the tail is from (3,1) to (6,3), so the bottom row y=1 has (2,1) to (6,1), but (2,1) is part of snake, etc.\n\nLet's list free cells or something.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the short-term goals.\n\nOption 1: Move right to (5,5) at turn 35.\n\nThen at (5,5), as above, can move D to (5,4) or R to (6,5), both have food.\n\n(5,4) has food, (6,5) has food.\n\nIf move to (5,4), eat food, grow, head at (5,4), then from there can move to adjacent.\n\nSimilarly, if move to (6,5), eat food, head at (6,5).\n\nBut let's see the situation.\n\nFirst, if at turn 35 move R to (5,5), no eat, positions as above.\n\nThen turn 36, from (5,5), if move D to (5,4), eat food at (5,4), so +1 score, snake grows to 14 segments.\n\nHead at (5,4), direction D (since moved down).\n\nPossible moves from (5,4): U to (5,5), but (5,5) is now body segment, occupied, so cannot move up.\n\nD to (5,3)? Is (5,3) free? Not wall, not obstacle, not in snake positions? After eating, positions include (5,4) head, (5,5) S1, (4,5) S2, etc., down to (6,2) tail.\n\n(5,3) not listed, so free.\n\nL to (4,4)? (4,4) not occupied, should be free.\n\nR to (6,4)? (6,4) has food, and not occupied.\n\n(6,4) is food, and not in snake positions, so free.\n\nAlso, current direction is D, so opposite is U, which is invalid anyway.\n\nSo from (5,4), can move D, L, or R.\n\nR to (6,4) has food, so can eat.\n\nBut let's see the tail reward danger.\n\nTail is at (6,2), head at (5,4), not adjacent.\n\n(5,4) to (6,2) is not adjacent; adjacent are (5,5), (5,3), (4,4), (6,4).\n\n(6,2) is down-right, not adjacent.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nIf at turn 36 from (5,5) move R to (6,5), eat food there.\n\nHead at (6,5), direction R.\n\nThen from there, possible moves.\n\nBut let's consider other options at turn 35.\n\nOption 2: at turn 35 move U to (4,6)\n\n(4,6) is at y=6, which is the top row.\n\nMove to (4,6), no food there, so just move.\n\nNew positions: head to (4,6), then body: S1: old head (4,5), S2: old S1 (3,5), S3: old S2 (2,5), S4: old S3 (2,4), S5: old S4 (2,3), S6: old S5 (2,2), S7: old S6 (2,1), S8: old S7 (3,1), S9: old S8 (4,1), S10: old S9 (5,1), S11: old S10 (6,1), S12: old S11 (6,2), tail at (6,3) vacated? No, after move no eat, tail moves.\n\nOld positions: S0:(4,5), S1:(3,5), S2:(2,5), S3:(2,4), S4:(2,3), S5:(2,2), S6:(2,1), S7:(3,1), S8:(4,1), S9:(5,1), S10:(6,1), S11:(6,2), S12:(6,3)\n\nMove U to (4,6): new head (4,6)\n\nS1: old S0 (4,5)\n\nS2: old S1 (3,5)\n\nS3: old S2 (2,5)\n\nS4: old S3 (2,4)\n\nS5: old S4 (2,3)\n\nS6: old S5 (2,2)\n\nS7: old S6 (2,1)\n\nS8: old S7 (3,1)\n\nS9: old S8 (4,1)\n\nS10: old S9 (5,1)\n\nS11: old S10 (6,1)\n\nS12: old S11 (6,2)  // tail, old (6,3) vacated\n\nSo tail at (6,2)\n\nHead at (4,6), direction U.\n\nNow from (4,6), possible moves: U to (4,7), but y=7 is wall, cannot.\n\nD to (4,5), but (4,5) is now occupied by S1, body, so collision.\n\nL to (3,6)? (3,6) is free? Not wall, not obstacle, not occupied, so free.\n\nR to (5,6), but (5,6) is obstacle, wall, cannot move.\n\nSo only possible move is L to (3,6).\n\nCannot move D or R, only L.\n\nMove to (3,6), no food there, so positions update.\n\nHead to (3,6), S1 to (4,6), S2 to (4,5), etc., tail moves to (6,1) or something.\n\nBut then the snake is going left, and food is at (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), which are right and down.\n\nBy moving up, it might be risky because it's cornering itself.\n\nAt (3,6), then can move L to (2,6) or D to (3,5), but (3,5) is body, etc.\n\nSeems less promising for getting food.\n\nSimilarly, option 3: at turn 35 move D to (4,4)\n\n(4,4) is empty, no food, so move down.\n\nNew positions: head to (4,4), S1 to (4,5), S2 to (3,5), S3 to (2,5), S4 to (2,4), S5 to (2,3), S6 to (2,2), S7 to (2,1), S8 to (3,1), S9 to (4,1), S10 to (5,1), S11 to (6,1), S12 to (6,2), tail at (6,3) vacated? S12 was (6,3), but after move, new S12 is old S11 (6,2), so tail at (6,2)\n\nHead at (4,4), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: U to (4,5), but (4,5) is S1, body, collision.\n\nD to (4,3)? (4,3) free? Not occupied, not wall, so free.\n\nL to (3,4)? (3,4) free.\n\nR to (5,4)? (5,4) has food.\n\nAlso, current direction D, opposite U invalid.\n\nSo can move D, L, or R to (5,4) with food.\n\nIf move R to (5,4), eat food, grow.\n\nHead at (5,4), etc.\n\nNow, comparing the options.\n\nAt turn 35, moving R to (5,5) seems good because it gets closer to food.\n\nMoving D to (4,4) also gets closer to (5,4) food.\n\nMoving U to (4,6) seems to lead to a dead end.\n\nSo probably avoid U.\n\nNow, between R and D.\n\nIf move R to (5,5) at t35, then at t36, I can move D to (5,4) to eat, or R to (6,5) to eat.\n\n(6,4) food has life 3, so must be eaten soon.\n\nAt t35, (6,4) can be eaten on 35,36,37.\n\nIf I go to (5,5) at t35, I can eat (5,4) or (6,5) at t36.\n\n(5,4) has longer life, so less urgent.\n\nSimilarly, (6,5) has life 6, so can wait.\n\nBut (6,4) might expire soon.\n\nFrom (5,5), if I move to (6,5) at t36, I eat (6,5), then head at (6,5), and (6,4) is below, I can move down to (6,4) to eat it at t37.\n\nBut let's see if I can reach it.\n\nFirst, prioritize long-term survival.\n\nThe snake body is taking a lot of space on the left and bottom.\n\nAfter eating, it grows, so more body.\n\nBut there is space on the right and top.\n\nFood at (6,4), (6,5), (5,4).\n\n(6,5) is at top-right, but (5,6) is blocked, so (6,5) is cornered.\n\n(6,5): adjacent cells: U to (6,6), but y=6 is top, x=6, (6,6) is not wall? Walls at y=0 and y=7, so y=6 is not wall, x=6 not wall, so (6,6) is free? Borders: x=0 and x=7 are walls, so x=6 is not wall, y=6 not wall.\n\nBut internal obstacle only at (5,6), so (6,6) should be free.\n\nSimilarly, (6,4) is at (6,4), D to (6,3), but (6,3) might be tail or something.\n\nAt current state, (6,3) is tail, but it will move.\n\nLet's plan a sequence.\n\nSuppose at t35, move R to (5,5) (no eat).\n\nThen at t36, I have two choices: move D to (5,4) to eat (5,4), or move R to (6,5) to eat (6,5).\n\nIf I eat (5,4) at t36, head at (5,4), then I can move to (6,4) to eat (6,4) at t37, since (6,4) is adjacent right.\n\nFrom (5,4), move R to (6,4), eat (6,4), since life 3, on t37 it can be eaten.\n\nThen head at (6,4), direction R.\n\nThen from there, I can move U to (6,5) to eat (6,5) if still there, but (6,5) has life 6, so at t37 it can be eaten, life span decreases.\n\nAt t35, (6,5) life=6, so can be eaten t35 to t40.\n\nAt t37, life=4 left? t35:6, t36:5, t37:4, so yes, can be eaten.\n\nSo from (6,4) at t37 after eating (6,4), move U to (6,5) to eat (6,5) at t37? (6,5) is above (6,4), so from (6,4) move U to (6,5).\n\nBut at that point, (6,5) might be occupied or not.\n\nAfter moving to (6,4) at t37, positions: let's simulate.\n\nStart from t35 move R to (5,5): positions as before: head (5,5), body (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) tail.\n\nt36 move D to (5,4): eat food at (5,4), grow.\n\nNew head (5,4), S1 (5,5), S2 (4,5), S3 (3,5), S4 (2,5), S5 (2,4), S6 (2,3), S7 (2,2), S8 (2,1), S9 (3,1), S10 (4,1), S11 (5,1), S12 (6,1), S13 (6,2) tail.  // S13 at (6,2)\n\nHead at (5,4), direction D (since moved down from (5,5)).\n\nt37, move R to (6,4): (6,4) has food, so eat, grow.\n\nNew head (6,4), S1 (5,4), S2 (5,5), S3 (4,5), S4 (3,5), S5 (2,5), S6 (2,4), S7 (2,3), S8 (2,2), S9 (2,1), S10 (3,1), S11 (4,1), S12 (5,1), S13 (6,1), S14 (6,2) tail.  // new tail at (6,2)\n\nHead at (6,4), direction R (moved right from (5,4)? From (5,4) to (6,4) is right, so direction R.\n\nNow, (6,5) is above, so move U to (6,5), which has food, life span at t37: original life 6 at t35, t36:5, t37:4, so can be eaten.\n\nMove U to (6,5), eat, grow.\n\nNew head (6,5), S1 (6,4), S2 (5,4), S3 (5,5), S4 (4,5), etc., down to S14 (6,1), S15 (6,2) tail? After move: new head (6,5), S1 old head (6,4), S2 old S1 (5,4), S3 old S2 (5,5), S4 old S3 (4,5), ..., S14 old S13 (6,1), S15 old S14 (6,2) tail.\n\nNow head at (6,5), which is top-right corner.\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,6)? (6,6) is not wall, free? Yes.\n\nD to (6,4), but (6,4) is now S1, body, occupied, cannot move down.\n\nL to (5,5), but (5,5) is S3? Positions: S1 (6,4), S2 (5,4), S3 (5,5), so (5,5) is occupied, cannot move left.\n\nR to (7,5), but x=7 is wall, cannot.\n\nSo only possible move is U to (6,6).\n\nMove to (6,6), no food, so head to (6,6), body shifts, tail moves from (6,2) to (6,1)? Positions: after eat at (6,5), positions as above with head (6,5), etc.\n\nAfter moving to (6,6) at t38: new head (6,6), S1 (6,5), S2 (6,4), S3 (5,4), S4 (5,5), ..., and so on, tail at old S14 position or something, but since no eat, tail moves.\n\nCurrent positions before move: head (6,5), S1 (6,4), S2 (5,4), S3 (5,5), S4 (4,5), S5 (3,5), S6 (2,5), S7 (2,4), S8 (2,3), S9 (2,2), S10 (2,1), S11 (3,1), S12 (4,1), S13 (5,1), S14 (6,1), S15 (6,2) tail? S15 at (6,2)\n\nMove to (6,6) no eat: new head (6,6), S1 (6,5), S2 (6,4), S3 (5,4), S4 (5,5), S5 (4,5), S6 (3,5), S7 (2,5), S8 (2,4), S9 (2,3), S10 (2,2), S11 (2,1), S12 (3,1), S13 (4,1), S14 (5,1), S15 (6,1) tail.  // old tail (6,2) vacated, S15 moves to (6,1)\n\nHead at (6,6), direction U.\n\nNow, from (6,6), possible moves: U to (6,7), y=7 wall, cannot.\n\nD to (6,5), but (6,5) is S1, body, occupied.\n\nL to (5,6), but (5,6) is obstacle, wall.\n\nR to (7,6), x=7 wall, cannot.\n\nNo possible moves! Snake is trapped and will die next turn.\n\nOh, big problem.\n\nAt (6,6), surrounded, cannot move anywhere. Game over.\n\nSo this path leads to death at turn 39 or so.\n\nAfter eating (6,5) at t37, head at (6,5), only can move to (6,6), then stuck.\n\nBut at t37, after eating (6,4), head at (6,4), instead of moving to (6,5), I could move elsewhere.\n\nFrom (6,4) at t37, head at (6,4), direction R.\n\nPossible moves: U to (6,5), D to (6,3), L to (5,4), R to (7,4) but x=7 wall, invalid.\n\n(6,3) might be free or not.\n\nIn positions after eating (6,4) at t37: head (6,4), S1 (5,4), S2 (5,5), S3 (4,5), S4 (3,5), S5 (2,5), S6 (2,4), S7 (2,3), S8 (2,2), S9 (2,1), S10 (3,1), S11 (4,1), S12 (5,1), S13 (6,1), S14 (6,2) tail.\n\nSo (6,3) is not occupied, free.\n\nD to (6,3) is possible.\n\nL to (5,4) is S1, occupied, cannot.\n\nSo from (6,4), can move U to (6,5) or D to (6,3).\n\nIf move D to (6,3), no food there, so move.\n\nHead to (6,3), S1 to (6,4), etc., tail moves to (6,1) or something.\n\nThen head at (6,3), can move to other places, like left or down.\n\nBut (6,5) food is still there, life until t40, so can eat later.\n\nBut the snake is long, and space is limited.\n\nBack to turn 35.\n\nIf at t35 move R to (5,5), then at t36 move R to (6,5) instead of D to (5,4).\n\nt35 move R to (5,5): positions head (5,5), body as before.\n\nt36 move R to (6,5): (6,5) has food, eat, grow.\n\nNew head (6,5), S1 (5,5), S2 (4,5), S3 (3,5), S4 (2,5), S5 (2,4), S6 (2,3), S7 (2,2), S8 (2,1), S9 (3,1), S10 (4,1), S11 (5,1), S12 (6,1), S13 (6,2) tail? Old tail was (6,3), but after move with eat, new positions: head (6,5), S1 old head (5,5), S2 old S1 (4,5), S3 old S2 (3,5), S4 old S3 (2,5), S5 old S4 (2,4), S6 old S5 (2,3), S7 old S6 (2,2), S8 old S7 (2,1), S9 old S8 (3,1), S10 old S9 (4,1), S11 old S10 (5,1), S12 old S11 (6,1), S13 old S12 (6,2), S14 old S13 (6,3) tail? Let's see: old S12 was (6,2)? After t35 move, positions: S0:(5,5), S1:(4,5), S2:(3,5), S3:(2,5), S4:(2,4), S5:(2,3), S6:(2,2), S7:(2,1), S8:(3,1), S9:(4,1), S10:(5,1), S11:(6,1), S12:(6,2)  // tail at (6,2)\n\nOld tail (6,3) vacated at t35 move.\n\nAt t36 move to (6,5) with eat: new head (6,5), S1 (5,5), S2 (4,5), S3 (3,5), S4 (2,5), S5 (2,4), S6 (2,3), S7 (2,2), S8 (2,1), S9 (3,1), S10 (4,1), S11 (5,1), S12 (6,1), S13 (6,2)  // and new S14 at old S12 position (6,2)? No.\n\nNew S1 = old S0 position (5,5)\n\nNew S2 = old S1 position (4,5)\n\n...\nNew S13 = old S12 position (6,2)\n\nThen new S14 = old S13 position, but there was no S13, since no growth before. Old snake had 13 segments, after eat, 14 segments.\n\nOld positions: 13 segments, S0 to S12.\n\nAfter move with eat: new S0: (6,5)\n\nNew S1: old S0 position (5,5)\n\nNew S2: old S1 position (4,5)\n\nNew S3: old S2 position (3,5)\n\nNew S4: old S3 position (2,5)\n\nNew S5: old S4 position (2,4)\n\nNew S6: old S5 position (2,3)\n\nNew S7: old S6 position (2,2)\n\nNew S8: old S7 position (2,1)\n\nNew S9: old S8 position (3,1)\n\nNew S10: old S9 position (4,1)\n\nNew S11: old S10 position (5,1)\n\nNew S12: old S11 position (6,1)\n\nNew S13: old S12 position (6,2)  // new tail\n\nSo tail at (6,2)\n\nHead at (6,5), direction R.\n\nNow from (6,5), possible moves: U to (6,6), D to (6,4), L to (5,5), R to (7,5) wall.\n\nL to (5,5) is S1, occupied, cannot.\n\nU to (6,6), free, no food.\n\nD to (6,4), has food.\n\nSo can move U or D.\n\nIf move D to (6,4), eat food at (6,4), grow.\n\nHead to (6,4), etc.\n\nThen similar to before, head at (6,4), then can move to (6,3) or something.\n\nBut (6,4) life span 3, at t36 it can be eaten, life=2 left? t35:3, t36:2, t37:1, gone t38.\n\nAt t36, eating (6,4) is possible.\n\nBut after eating, head at (6,4), then moves.\n\nBut it might get stuck in the corner.\n\nFor example, from (6,4), move D to (6,3), then to (6,2), but (6,2) might be tail or something.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (6,2), but moving to (6,2) when tail is there might be ok if tail moves.\n\nBut let's see tail reward danger.\n\nRule: \"Tail Reward Danger: If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\"\n\nBut here, the food is not on tail, it's on separate cells.\n\nIn this case, no issue.\n\nBut the problem is the snake is long and the space is small, with walls.\n\nThe grid is 6x6 minus one cell, so 35 cells, snake has 13 segments, after eating two food, 15 segments, less space.\n\nBut there are free cells.\n\nLet's list all free cells at current state to see space.\n\nGrid cells: x 1-6, y 1-6, except (5,6) obstacle.\n\nTotal cells: 6*6=36 minus 1 = 35 cells.\n\nSnake occupies 13 cells, so 22 free.\n\nFood at (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), so 3 food cells, but they are not occupied, so free cells include these.\n\nFree cells: all except walls, obstacle, and snake.\n\nWalls are borders, not part of grid, so playable cells are 35.\n\nSnake: 13 cells occupied.\n\nFood: 3 cells, but they are free to move to, but occupied by food, so when moving there, eat.\n\nFor free space, the cells not occupied by snake or walls or obstacle.\n\nSo free cells: 35 total playable - 13 snake = 22 cells, which include the 3 food cells.\n\nAfter eating, snake grows, free cells decrease.\n\nBut for now, there is space.\n\nBut in the corner, it can be tight.\n\nBack to turn 35.\n\nAnother option: move D to (4,4) at t35.\n\nThen from there, can move to (5,4) to eat at t36.\n\nt35 move D to (4,4): no food, so positions: head (4,4), S1 (4,5), S2 (3,5), S3 (2,5), S4 (2,4), S5 (2,3), S6 (2,2), S7 (2,1), S8 (3,1), S9 (4,1), S10 (5,1), S11 (6,1), S12 (6,2) tail.  // old tail (6,3) vacated\n\nHead at (4,4), direction D.\n\nt36, move R to (5,4): (5,4) has food, eat, grow.\n\nNew head (5,4), S1 (4,4), S2 (4,5), S3 (3,5), S4 (2,5), S5 (2,4), S6 (2,3), S7 (2,2), S8 (2,1), S9 (3,1), S10 (4,1), S11 (5,1), S12 (6,1), S13 (6,2) tail.\n\nHead at (5,4), direction R (moved right from (4,4)?

After t35 move to (4,6), positions: head (4,6), S1 (4,5), S2 (3,5), S3 (2,5), S4 (2,4), S5 (2,3), S6 (2,2), S7 (2,1), S8 (3,1), S9 (4,1), S10 (5,1), S11 (6,1), S12 (6,2) tail.\n\nt36 move L to (3,6): new head (3,6), S1 (4,6), S2 (4,5), S3 (3,5), S4 (2,5), S5 (2,4), S6 (2,3), S7 (2,2), S8 (2,1), S9 (3,1), S10 (4,1), S11 (5,1), S12 (6,1) tail.  // old tail (6,2) vacated\n\nHead at (3,6), direction L.\n\nNow moves: U to (3,7) wall, D to (3,5), but (3,5) is S3, body, occupied, cannot.\n\nL to (2,6), free.\n\nR to (4,6), but (4,6) is S1, occupied, cannot.\n\nSo only L to (2,6).\n\nMove to (2,6), no food, head to (2,6), etc.\n\nThen the snake is going to the left top, and the food at (5,4), (6,4), (6,5) are far, and (6,4) may expire soon.\n\nNot efficient for eating.\n\nSo better to go for the food.\n\nBut to avoid the corner, when at (6,4) or (6,5), don't go to (6,6).\n\nInstead, from (5,5) or (5,4), go down or left.\n\nAt turn 35, move R to (5,5), then at t36, instead of eating, move to a safe place.\n\nFrom (5,5), at t36, I can move D to (5,4) to eat, or R to (6,5) to eat, or if I don't eat, but there is no other move, only D or R, both have food or lead to food.\n\n(5,4) has food, (6,5) has food, so moving to them eats.\n\nI have to move to one of them.\n\nAt (5,5), only D or R, both result in eating food at t36.\n\nThen after that, I need to avoid the corner.\n\nFor example, at t36, from (5,5) move D to (5,4) eat, head at (5,4).\n\nThen at t37, instead of moving R to (6,4), move D to (5,3) or L to (4,4), etc.\n\nFrom (5,4), can move U to (5,5) but occupied, D to (5,3), L to (4,4), R to (6,4).\n\n(4,4) is free, no food.\n\n(5,3) free.\n\n(6,4) has food.\n\nIf I move L to (4,4) or D to (5,3), I avoid the right side.\n\nThen I can go down or left.\n\nFor example, move D to (5,3) at t37.\n\nHead to (5,3), no food, so positions shift, tail moves.\n\nHead at (5,3), then can move to other cells.\n\nBut (6,4) food has life span 3, at t37 it has 1 turn left, so must be eaten at t37 or gone.\n\nAt t35, (6,4) life=3, can be eaten t35,36,37.\n\nAt t37, it can be eaten, but if I don't eat it, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, at t37, if I am at (5,4), and I move to (6,4) to eat it, or not.\n\nIf I don't eat it, I miss the food.\n\nBut to survive long-term, missing one food might be ok, since there are others.\n\n(6,4) is only +1, not critical.\n\nBut let's see the score.\n\nAll food is +1, so eating all is good, but survival first.\n\nIf I eat (6,4) at t37, I might get stuck, as before.\n\nBut in the earlier sequence, when I went to (6,4) then to (6,5), I got stuck at (6,6).\n\nBut if from (6,4) I move D to (6,3), I can avoid (6,5) for now.\n\nThen from (6,3), I can move to the bottom.\n\nFor example, at t37 from (5,4) move R to (6,4) eat, head at (6,4), direction R.\n\nt38 move D to (6,3), no food, so head to (6,3), S1 to (6,4), etc., tail moves to (6,1) or something.\n\nHead at (6,3), then can move L to (5,3), D to (6,2), but (6,2) might be tail.\n\nIn positions: after eating (6,4) at t37, positions: head (6,4), S1 (5,4), S2 (5,5), S3 (4,5), S4 (3,5), S5 (2,5), S6 (2,4), S7 (2,3), S8 (2,2), S9 (2,1), S10 (3,1), S11 (4,1), S12 (5,1), S13 (6,1), S14 (6,2) tail.\n\nt38 move D to (6,3): no food, so new head (6,3), S1 (6,4), S2 (5,4), S3 (5,5), S4 (4,5), S5 (3,5), S6 (2,5), S7 (2,4), S8 (2,3), S9 (2,2), S10 (2,1), S11 (3,1), S12 (4,1), S13 (5,1), S14 (6,1) tail.  // old tail (6,2) vacated, S14 to (6,1)\n\nHead at (6,3), direction D.\n\nThen can move U to (6,4) but occupied, D to (6,2), but (6,2) is not occupied now, free, or L to (5,3), R to (7,3) wall.\n\n(6,2) is free, so can move D or L.\n\nMove L to (5,3), then to (5,2), etc.\n\nOr move D to (6,2), then to (6,1), but (6,1) is S14, occupied? S14 is at (6,1), so moving to (6,2) is fine, but (6,1) is body.\n\nFrom (6,3), move L to (5,3), no food, head to (5,3), etc.\n\nThen the snake is safer, and (6,5) food can be eaten later.\n\n(6,5) at t38 has life 3 left? t35:6, t36:5, t37:4, t38:3, so can be eaten until t40.\n\nSo possible.\n\nBut to maximize score, eat all food.\n\nBut long-term survival is priority.\n\nNow, another option at turn 35: move D to (4,4).\n\nThen at t36, move R to (5,4) eat, head at (5,4).\n\nThen same as above.\n\nOr from (4,4), at t36 move L to (3,4) or D to (4,3), but not towards food.\n\nBut food is there, so probably move to eat.\n\nI think moving R at t35 is reasonable.\n\nThen to avoid corner, from (5,4) at t37, move down or left instead of right.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 35: move R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 36: move D to (5,4) eat (5,4)  // score +1\n\nNow head at (5,4), direction D\n\nTurn 37: move D to (5,3)  // down, to (5,3), no food\n\nHead to (5,3), S1 to (5,4), S2 to (5,5), etc.\n\nPositions: after t36 eat at (5,4): head (5,4), S1 (5,5), S2 (4,5), S3 (3,5), S4 (2,5), S5 (2,4), S6 (2,3), S7 (2,2), S8 (2,1), S9 (3,1), S10 (4,1), S11 (5,1), S12 (6,1), S13 (6,2) tail.\n\nt37 move D to (5,3): no food, so new head (5,3), S1 (5,4), S2 (5,5), S3 (4,5), S4 (3,5), S5 (2,5), S6 (2,4), S7 (2,3), S8 (2,2), S9 (2,1), S10 (3,1), S11 (4,1), S12 (5,1), S13 (6,1) tail.  // old tail (6,2) vacated, S13 to (6,1)\n\nHead at (5,3), direction D.\n\nNow, (6,4) food is still there, life at t37: life=1, can be eaten this turn or gone next.\n\nBut head at (5,3), not adjacent to (6,4), so cannot eat this turn.\n\n(6,4) is at (6,4), adjacent to (6,3), (6,5), (5,4), (7,4) wall.\n\n(5,4) is S1, occupied, so no, cannot be eaten at t37.\n\nAt t37, life=1, so after this turn, it disappears, so missed.\n\nBut there is (6,5) with more life.\n\nFrom (5,3), can move to (6,3) or (5,2), etc.\n\nFor example, move R to (6,3) at t37.\n\nHead to (6,3), no food, S1 to (5,3), etc., tail to (6,1) or something.\n\nThen head at (6,3), can move U to (6,4) but (6,4) food gone by t38, or to (6,2), etc.\n\nBut (6,5) is at (6,5), can be eaten later.\n\nSo possible.\n\nBut to eat (6,4), I need to be there by t37.\n\nAt turn 35, if I move directly towards it.\n\nFor example, at t35, move R to (5,5), t36 move R to (6,5) eat (6,5), then at t37 move D to (6,4) eat (6,4).\n\nThen head at (6,4), then move D to (6,3) or L to (5,4), etc.\n\nFrom (6,4), if I move D to (6,3), as before, I can escape the corner.\n\nThen not stuck.\n\nSo let's plan that.\n\nTurn 35: move R to (5,5)  // no eat\n\nTurn 36: move R to (6,5) eat (6,5)  // score +1\n\nPositions: head (6,5), S1 (5,5), S2 (4,5), S3 (3,5), S4 (2,5), S5 (2,4), S6 (2,3), S7 (2,2), S8 (2,1), S9 (3,1), S10 (4,1), S11 (5,1), S12 (6,1), S13 (6,2) tail.  // 14 segments\n\nHead at (6,5), direction R.\n\nTurn 37: move D to (6,4) eat (6,4)  // score +1, life of (6,4) at t37 is 1, so just in time.\n\nNew head (6,4), S1 (6,5), S2 (5,5), S3 (4,5), S4 (3,5), S5 (2,5), S6 (2,4), S7 (2,3), S8 (2,2), S9 (2,1), S10 (3,1), S11 (4,1), S12 (5,1), S13 (6,1), S14 (6,2) tail.  // 15 segments\n\nHead at (6,4), direction D (moved down from (6,5)).\n\nNow turn 38: move D to (6,3)  // down, no food\n\nNew head (6,3), S1 (6,4), S2 (6,5), S3 (5,5), S4 (4,5), S5 (3,5), S6 (2,5), S7 (2,4), S8 (2,3), S9 (2,2), S10 (2,1), S11 (3,1), S12 (4,1), S13 (5,1), S14 (6,1) tail.  // old tail (6,2) vacated, S14 to (6,1)\n\nHead at (6,3), direction D.\n\nNow can move L to (5,3), or D to (6,2), but (6,2) is not occupied, free, or U to (6,4) occupied, R wall.\n\n(6,2) is free, so can move D to (6,2) or L to (5,3).\n\nSay move L to (5,3) at t38.\n\nHead to (5,3), S1 to (6,3), etc.\n\nThen the snake is moving left, and there is space.\n\nAlso, (5,4) food is still there, life 9, can be eaten later.\n\nFor example, from (5,3), can move to (5,4) or (4,3), etc.\n\nSo this seems safer.\n\nIf at turn 38 from (6,3) move D to (6,2), then to (6,1), but (6,1) is S14, occupied, so moving to (6,2) is fine, but then at (6,2), can move L to (5,2) or U to (6,3) occupied, so only L or possibly D to (6,1) but occupied.\n\nAt (6,2), if I move there, it might be tight.\n\nBetter to move away from the wall.\n\nSo moving L to (5,3) is better.\n\nThen I can go to the center or bottom.\n\nSo for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nThe format is to output for turn t1, t1+1, etc., but since future depends on choices, I can output a sequence based on current state.\n\nProbably for the next few turns.\n\nSince I need to think ahead, but output for the immediate action and suggest future.\n\nThe answer format is to box the actions for several turns.\n\n\"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn \\(t_1\\): action ... Turn \\(t_1 + 1\\): action ... }\"\n\nAnd it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", so I should provide a sequence for 5 turns or so.\n\nBut the state might change with food disappearance, so I need to plan based on current.\n\nFood life span decreases, so I can predict when they disappear.\n\nAt turn 35, (6,4) disappears after turn 37, so gone at turn 38.\n\n(6,5) disappears after turn 40, gone turn 41.\n\n(5,4) after turn 43, gone turn 44.\n\nSnake positions will change.\n\nFor the sequence, I can do:\n\nTurn 35: move R to (5,5)\n\nTurn 36: move R to (6,5) eat (6,5)\n\nTurn 37: move D to (6,4) eat (6,4)\n\nTurn 38: move D to (6,3)\n\nTurn 39: move L to (5,3)\n\nThen from there, depending on situation.\n\nBut at turn 39, from (6,3) move L to (5,3), no food.\n\nThen head at (5,3), can move to (5,4) to eat if possible, but (5,4) is not adjacent directly; from (5,3), adjacent are U(5,4), D(5,2), L(4,3), R(6,3) but (6,3) is body now.\n\nAfter turn 38 move to (6,3), positions: head (6,3), S1 (6,4), S2 (6,5), S3 (5,5), S4 (4,5), S5 (3,5), S6 (2,5), S7 (2,4), S8 (2,3), S9 (2,2), S10 (2,1), S11 (3,1), S12 (4,1), S13 (5,1), S14 (6,1) tail.\n\nTurn 39 move L to (5,3): (5,3) is free? Not occupied, so yes. No food, so move.\n\nNew head (5,3), S1 (6,3), S2 (6,4), S3 (6,5), S4 (5,5), S5 (4,5), S6 (3,5), S7 (2,5), S8 (2,4), S9 (2,3), S10 (2,2), S11 (2,1), S12 (3,1), S13 (4,1), S14 (5,1) tail.  // S14 to (5,1), old tail (6,1) vacated\n\nHead at (5,3), direction L.\n\nThen turn 40, can move U to (5,4) which has food? (5,4) has food, and not occupied, so move U to (5,4) eat.\n\nThen score again.\n\nSo this sequence eats all three food and avoids the corner.\n\nPerfect.\n\nAt turn 35, if I move D to (4,4), I can also reach the food.\n\nBut moving R directly is fine.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output actions starting from turn 35.\n\nAlso, the head direction changes, but I don't need to track it for output, just the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, I have:\n\nTurn 35: R (to (5,5))\n\nTurn 36: R (to (6,5) eat)\n\nTurn 37: D (to (6,4) eat)\n\nTurn 38: D (to (6,3))\n\nTurn 39: L (to (5,3))\n\nThen beyond, but for 5 turns, up to turn 39 or 40.\n\nTurn t1=35, so turns 35 to 39 is 5 turns.\n\n35,36,37,38,39.\n\nAt turn 39, move L to (5,3), as above.\n\nThen turn 40, move U to (5,4) to eat, but that's optional for the sequence.\n\nSince the food at (5,4) has long life, I can include or not.\n\nBut for the answer, I think up to 5 turns is fine.\n\nNow, to confirm, at turn 35, move R: possible, no issue.\n\nThen turn 36, from (5,5) move R to (6,5): possible, and eat.\n\nTurn 37, from (6,5) move D to (6,4): possible, eat.\n\nTurn 38, from (6,4) move D to (6,3): possible.\n\nTurn 39, from (6,3) move L to (5,3): possible.\n\nAll safe, no collision.\n\nAnd I eat two food, with (5,4) still available for later.\n\nSo this should be good.\n</think>\nTo maximize the snake's score while prioritizing long-term survival, the strategy involves eating the high-urgency food at (6,4) (life span 3, expiring after turn 37) and (6,5) (life span 6, less urgent) while avoiding the dangerous top-right corner near (6,6). The food at (5,4) has a long life span (9 turns) and can be eaten later. The sequence starts by moving right to (5,5) to access both (6,5) and (6,4), then eats them in sequence while escaping the corner by moving down and left to open space.\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n- **Turn 35:** Head at (4,5) with direction R. Possible moves: U (to (4,6)), D (to (4,4)), R (to (5,5)). L is invalid (opposite direction and body collision). Moving R to (5,5) positions the snake to reach (6,4) and (6,5) efficiently.\n- **Turn 36:** From (5,5), moves: D (to (5,4) with food) or R (to (6,5) with food). Moving R to (6,5) eats the food and avoids immediate corner risk.\n- **Turn 37:** From (6,5), moves: U (to (6,6)), D (to (6,4) with food). Moving D to (6,4) eats the expiring food and starts escaping the corner.\n- **Turn 38:** From (6,4), moves: U (to (6,5), occupied), D (to (6,3)), L (to (5,4), occupied), R (invalid, wall). Moving D to (6,3) opens paths downward.\n- **Turn 39:** From (6,3), moves: U (to (6,4), occupied), D (to (6,2)), L (to (5,3)), R (invalid, wall). Moving L to (5,3) accesses the center and avoids dead ends.\n- **Long-term:** After turn 39, the snake can eat (5,4) from (5,3) by moving up, then navigate to open areas (e.g., left or down) for survival. The body is concentrated on the left and bottom, so the right-center has space.\n\n**Action Sequence (5 turns ahead):**\n- Turn 35: R (right to (5,5)) – Positions head near food and maintains options.\n- Turn 36: R (right to (6,5)) – Eats (6,5) (+1 score), avoids cornering early.\n- Turn 37: D (down to (6,4)) – Eats (6,4) (+1 score) before it expires.\n- Turn 38: D (down to (6,3)) – Escapes top-right corner toward open space.\n- Turn 39: L (left to (5,3)) – Moves to center, setting up to eat (5,4) next.\n\nThis sequence eats two food items, gains +2 score, and ensures survival by avoiding the trapped state at (6,6). The remaining food at (5,4) can be eaten on turn 40 or later with no risk.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 35: R (right)\nTurn 36: R (right)\nTurn 37: D (down)\nTurn 38: D (down)\nTurn 39: L (left)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state of the Snake game on this 2D grid. The grid has walls and obstacles, and the snake has a specific position and direction. There are food items with values and life spans that I need to consider for maximizing score while avoiding risks.\n\nCurrent Turn: 37\n\nWalls:\n\n- Border cells: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the grid is from (0,0) to (7,7), and moving to any cell with x=0, x=7, y=0, or y=7 is a wall collision.\n\n- Internal obstacle: (5,6)\n\nSnake Positions: The snake's body segments are listed from head to tail. Head is at (6,5), then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2). So that's 14 segments.\n\nI should list out the positions to visualize:\n\n- Head: (6,5)\n\n- Body: (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\n- Then it turns down: (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1)\n\n- Then right: (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\n- Then up: (6,2)\n\nTail is at (6,2)\n\nSnake Head Direction: R (right). So it's moving to the right.\n\nFood Items:\n\n1. (6,4) with value 1 and life span 1. Since life span is 1, it disappears after this turn or next? Life span decreases every turn including current. On turn 37, life span is 1, so after this turn, it should disappear. Let me read carefully.\n\n\"Life-span: Disappears after N turns (N = life_span). Countdown decreases every turn (including current).\"\n\nSo for food at (6,4), life_span=1 on turn 37. That means on turn 37, if not eaten, it will disappear after turn 37. Since countdown decreases every turn including current, on turn 37, life_span=1, after turn 37, it becomes 0 and disappears. So it can be eaten on turn 37 if the snake moves there.\n\nSimilarly, other food:\n\n2. (5,4) with value 1 and life span 7. So it has 7 turns left including turn 37.\n\n3. (1,3) with value 1 and life span 10. Value 10? No, let's see: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - (6, 4, 1, 1) - (5, 4, 7, 1) - (1, 3, 10, 1)\"\n\nFormat is (x, y, value, life_span) I think. But for (6,4,1,1), that's x=6,y=4,value=1,life_span=1.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4,7,1) – value=7? But it says value and life span, and all are positive food since value is positive? But in the description, negative food has value -1, but here all values are positive? (6,4,1,1) value=1, (5,4,7,1) value=7, (1,3,10,1) value=10? That seems odd, but in the food list, it says \"Value and Life Span\", and for (5,4,7,1), it might be value=7, life_span=1? But life_span=1 for (5,4) but it has 7? Let's parse:\n\n\"Food Positions, Life Span and Value:\n- (6, 4, 1, 1)\n- (5, 4, 7, 1)\n- (1, 3, 10, 1)\"\n\nI think it's (x,y, life_span, value) or (x,y, value, life_span)? The text says \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span\", but in the list, it's written as (x,y, something, something).\n\nLook: \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) \" in the input format.\n\nIn the state, it's given as: (6, 4, 1, 1) – probably (x,y, value, life_span). Similarly, (5,4,7,1) – value=7, life_span=1? But life_span=1, but it has 7? That can't be right.\n\nPerhaps it's (x,y, life_span, value). But the text says \"Value and Life Span\".\n\nCheck the core rules: \"Food Positions, Value and Life Span: - ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 )\"\n\nIn the state, it's listed as: (6, 4, 1, 1) – I think it's (x,y, value, life_span) so for (6,4), value=1, life_span=1.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4,7,1) – value=7, life_span=1.\n\n(1,3,10,1) – value=10, life_span=1.\n\nBut life_span=1 for all? That seems suspicious. For (5,4,7,1), if life_span=1, it should disappear after turn 37, but it has value=7, which is high.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3,10,1) value=10, life_span=1.\n\nAnd (6,4,1,1) value=1, life_span=1.\n\nAll food has life_span=1? But (5,4,7,1) has value=7, not 1.\n\nIn the list, it's (5,4,7,1), so value=7, life_span=1.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3,10,1) value=10, life_span=1.\n\n(6,4,1,1) value=1, life_span=1.\n\nSo all food will disappear after this turn if not eaten on turn 37.\n\nLife_span N, disappears after N turns. Countdown decreases every turn including current.\n\nOn turn 37, life_span=1 for all, so after turn 37, life_span=0, so they disappear. So they can only be eaten on turn 37; if not, they're gone.\n\nBut the snake is at (6,5), and food is at (6,4), which is directly below the head.\n\nAlso, food at (5,4) and (1,3).\n\nBut (6,4) is adjacent, down from head.\n\nCurrent head position: (6,5)\n\nFood at (6,4) – directly down.\n\nAlso, (5,4) is left and down from head? Head at (6,5), (5,4) is x-1, y-1, so diagonal, not adjacent directly. Snake can only move up, down, left, right, not diagonal. So adjacent cells are (6,6), (6,4), (5,5), (7,5).\n\nBut (7,5) is x=7, which is a wall, so not accessible.\n\n(6,6) is y=6, but y=7 is border, so (6,6) is within bounds? Grid from x=0 to 7, y=0 to 7, so (6,6) is valid, but is it occupied?\n\nLet's list possible moves from current position.\n\nCurrent head: (6,5), direction R (right).\n\nPossible moves: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), L (left, x-1), R (right, x+1)\n\nBut cannot move opposite to current direction immediately. Current direction is R, so cannot move L (left) next turn. So opposite of R is L, so cannot move left on turn 37.\n\nAlso, walls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls.\n\nSo for (6,5):\n\n- U: (6,6) – is this a wall? y=6, y=7 is border, so y=6 is not wall, unless specified. Walls are x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, so (6,6) is within bounds.\n\n- D: (6,4) – y=4, not wall.\n\n- L: (5,5) – x=5, not wall.\n\n- R: (7,5) – x=7, which is wall, so cannot move right.\n\nAlso, internal obstacle at (5,6), but that's not relevant for immediate moves.\n\nNow, snake body positions: need to avoid colliding with body.\n\nCurrent body segments: from head to tail: (6,5) head, then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nSo cells occupied: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nFor move to (6,6): (6,6) is not in the body list, and not wall, so possible.\n\n(6,4): not in body list? Body has (6,5), (6,1), (6,2), not (6,4). So (6,4) is empty? But food is there.\n\n(6,4) has food, but for movement, if snake moves to (6,4), it eats the food if it's positive and not tail danger.\n\nSimilarly, (5,5): (5,5) is the first body segment, so if snake moves left to (5,5), it would collide with body, since (5,5) is occupied and not the tail.\n\nWhen snake moves, the tail moves, so only cells that will be occupied after move matter.\n\nStandard snake: when head moves to a new cell, if it's food, snake grows, so tail doesn't move. If not food, tail moves forward.\n\nBut here, food can be positive or negative.\n\nAlso, collision: head touches any body segment except that it can move into the tail cell because tail moves away, so no collision.\n\nIn this case, possible moves from (6,5):\n\n- U: to (6,6)\n\n- D: to (6,4)\n\n- L: to (5,5)\n\n- R: to (7,5) but wall, invalid.\n\nNow, (5,5) is currently occupied by the second segment. After move, if snake moves to (5,5), since (5,5) is not the tail, and tail is at (6,2), moving to (5,5) would cause collision because the body segment is there.\n\nBut when head moves to a cell, if that cell is occupied by a body part that is not the tail, it collides. If it is the tail, and tail moves, it might be ok, but only if no food is eaten or something.\n\nRule: \"Body collision (head touches any body segment). But note you can still move into the cell occupied by the tail segment, since the tail will also move forward.\"\n\nSo, moving to tail cell is safe if the tail moves away.\n\nIn this case, for move to (5,5): (5,5) is occupied by the second segment, not the tail. Tail is at (6,2). So moving to (5,5) would collide with body, since it's not the tail.\n\nSimilarly, (6,6) is empty, so no collision.\n\n(6,4) has food, but for movement, moving to (6,4) is fine, as long as not colliding.\n\nNow, food at (6,4): value=1, life_span=1, so if eaten on turn 37, snake grows by +1 segment, score +1.\n\nBut there is a danger: \"Tail Reward Danger\": If the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills the snake, because the head and newly grown tail will collide.\n\nIn this case, tail is at (6,2). Head at (6,5). Are they adjacent? (6,5) and (6,2) are not adjacent; they are 3 cells apart vertically. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (6,5) and (6,4) are adjacent, or (5,5) and (6,5), etc. (6,5) and (6,2) are not adjacent; distance in y is 3, so not adjacent. So no tail reward danger for (6,4) food.\n\nSimilarly, for other food.\n\nNow, back to moves: possible actions on turn 37:\n\n- U: to (6,6)\n\n- D: to (6,4) and eat food (6,4) with value 1\n\n- L: to (5,5) but (5,5) is body, not tail, so collision, invalid.\n\n- R: to (7,5) wall, invalid.\n\nSo only possible moves are U or D.\n\nNow, D to (6,4) eats the food, but it has low value 1, and life_span=1, so if not eaten now, it disappears.\n\nBut there is other food with higher value: (5,4) with value 7, and (1,3) with value 10, but both have life_span=1, so they also disappear after this turn if not eaten.\n\n(5,4) is at (5,4), which is not adjacent to head. Head at (6,5), (5,4) is one left and one down, so not reachable in one move.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) is far away.\n\nSo on turn 37, the only food I can possibly eat is (6,4) by moving down.\n\nIf I move down, I eat (6,4), value 1, snake grows, so length increases by 1.\n\nIf I move up to (6,6), I don't eat anything, and all food disappears, so I miss this food.\n\nBut moving down seems safe, and I get +1 score.\n\nBut I need to think ahead 5+ turns for long-term survival.\n\nAlso, after eating, snake grows, so tail doesn't move.\n\nCurrent snake positions: 14 segments.\n\nIf I eat (6,4), new head at (6,4), and tail stays where it is, so the body adds a new segment at (6,4) or something.\n\nAfter eating, head moves to new position, and a new segment is added at the head position, so the tail doesn't move. So the snake becomes longer.\n\nPositions: from (6,5) move down to (6,4), eat food, so new head at (6,4), and the previous head (6,5) becomes body, so new positions: head (6,4), then (6,5), then (5,5), (4,5), ..., up to tail (6,2). Length 15.\n\nIf I move up to (6,6), no food, so head moves to (6,6), tail moves to the next position. Tail is at (6,2), after move, tail moves to (6,1)? Let's see the positions.\n\nCurrent positions: [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)] tail at (6,2).\n\nIf no food eaten, head moves to new position, tail moves one step.\n\nSo if move U to (6,6), new head (6,6), then body: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), and tail was (6,2), but since tail moves, (6,2) is no longer part of snake, so positions: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)] and (6,2) is free now.\n\nLength remains 14.\n\nNow, all food disappears after turn 37 since life_span=1 for all, so no food left after turn 37? But new food might spawn, but the state doesn't say anything about new food spawning. I think we assume that food is only given, and no new food spawns unless specified, but the problem doesn't mention food spawning rules. In the input, only current food is given, so probably no new food, or we have to work with what's given.\n\nBut food has life span, and after disappearing, no food, so the only way to score is to eat the existing food before it disappears.\n\nHere, all food has life_span=1, so after turn 37, all food gone, no score possible later.\n\nTherefore, I must eat one of them on turn 37 to get any score.\n\nThe only one I can reach is (6,4) by moving down.\n\nMoving to (5,4) or (1,3) is impossible in one move.\n\nSo on turn 37, I should move down to eat (6,4) and get +1 score.\n\nBut (5,4) has value 7, and (1,3) has value 10, but I can't reach them this turn, so I miss them.\n\nPerhaps I can plan to eat them, but they disappear after this turn, so no chance.\n\nUnless life_span decreases after the turn, but as per rule, countdown decreases every turn including current, so on turn 37, life_span=1, after turn 37, it becomes 0 and disappears. So only on turn 37 I can eat it.\n\nSo for (5,4) and (1,3), I can't eat them because they are not adjacent to head.\n\nHead at (6,5), adjacent cells: (6,6), (6,4), (5,5), (7,5)\n\n(7,5) wall, (5,5) body, (6,4) food, (6,6) empty.\n\n(5,4) is not adjacent; it's (5,4), which is not directly reachable.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) is far.\n\nSo only option is to eat (6,4) or not.\n\nIf I don't eat, I get 0, but I can survive, but no score.\n\nSince the goal is to maximize score, I should eat it.\n\nBut let's confirm the tail danger.\n\nTail at (6,2), head moving to (6,4), after eating, head at (6,4), body includes (6,5) and (5,5), etc., tail at (6,2). (6,4) and (6,2) not adjacent, so no danger.\n\nAlso, (6,4) is not under body; it's empty now, I think.\n\nCurrent positions: (6,4) has food, not occupied by snake, so moving there is fine.\n\nSo moving D to (6,4) is safe and gets +1.\n\nBut is there a reason not to? Perhaps for future moves.\n\nAfter moving to (6,4), head at (6,4), direction was R, but I moved D, so new direction is D.\n\nThen on next turn, I can move from there.\n\nBut since no food left after turn 37, the game might be over, or I need to survive, but with no food, I can just move around safely.\n\nBut the snake is long, 14 or 15 segments, and grid is 8x8, with walls and obstacles.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, so 8 cells wide, y from 0 to 7, 8 cells high.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nAfter turn 37, if I eat (6,4), snake at: head (6,4), then (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) — 15 positions, but when I eat, new head at (6,4), and the body is previous positions minus tail movement? No.\n\nWhen snake eats food, head moves to new cell, and a new segment is added at the head position, so tail does not move. So the snake grows by one segment.\n\nCurrent positions: 14 segments.\n\nAfter eating at (6,4): new positions: head at (6,4), then the previous head (6,5) becomes neck, and so on, up to tail (6,2), so now 15 segments: [(6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)]\n\nIf I didn't eat, and moved up, positions: [(6,6), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)] and tail moved from (6,2), so (6,2) free.\n\nBut with no food, I can survive by moving safely.\n\nBut since no food, score doesn't increase.\n\nSo for scoring, eating (6,4) gives +1, not eating gives 0, so I should eat it.\n\nBut there might be a risk. Let's see the grid.\n\nInternal obstacle at (5,6), which might affect movement.\n\nAlso, walls.\n\nAfter moving to (6,4), head at (6,4), direction D.\n\nThen possible moves: from (6,4), can go U to (6,5), but (6,5) is now body, since after move, (6,5) is the second segment.\n\nAfter move to (6,4), positions: head (6,4), body (6,5), (5,5), etc.\n\nSo from (6,4), possible moves:\n\n- U to (6,5): but (6,5) is occupied by body, not tail. Tail is at (6,2), so moving to (6,5) would collide.\n\n- D to (6,3): is (6,3) free? Current positions don't have (6,3), and no wall, so possible.\n\n- L to (5,4): (5,4) has food? Food at (5,4) but it should disappear after turn 37, so on turn 38, no food, so (5,4) is empty? But food disappears after turn 37, so on turn 38, no food.\n\n- R to (7,4): x=7 wall, invalid.\n\nAlso, direction: previous move was D, so cannot move opposite, which is U, but U is to (6,5) which is body anyway, so invalid.\n\nOpposite of D is U, so cannot move U.\n\nSo possible moves from (6,4) after eating:\n\n- D to (6,3)\n\n- L to (5,4)\n\n(5,4) is empty now, since food disappeared.\n\nSimilarly, (6,3) empty.\n\nBut (5,4) might be occupied? No, after turn 37, food gone, and snake positions, (5,4) not occupied.\n\nCurrent positions after move: head (6,4), body (6,5), (5,5), etc., not (5,4) or (6,3).\n\nSo both (6,3) and (5,4) are free.\n\nBut since no food, no score, just moving to survive.\n\nSimilarly, if I had moved up to (6,6) on turn 37, head at (6,6), then can move, etc.\n\nBut since no food, it doesn't matter for score.\n\nTherefore, on turn 37, moving down to eat (6,4) is the only way to gain any score, +1.\n\nNot eating gives 0.\n\nSo I should do that.\n\nBut the food at (5,4) and (1,3) have high value but I can't reach them, so they are wasted.\n\nPerhaps I can think if there's a way to reach them, but no, not on this turn.\n\nMaybe the life span is wrong.\n\nFor (5,4,7,1), it says value=7, life_span=1, so life_span=1 on turn 37.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nPerhaps it's a typo, but I have to go with the state.\n\nAnother thing: \"Special Cases: Food can spawn under the snake's body but can only be eaten if the body moves away and head moves onto it.\"\n\nBut in this case, (6,4) is not under body; it's free, with food.\n\nSimilarly, others are not under body.\n\n(5,4) is at (5,4), is it under snake? Current snake positions: (6,5), (5,5), etc., not (5,4), so not under.\n\n(1,3) not under.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, for turn 37, action should be D (down).\n\nBut the answer needs to be for multiple turns, 5+ turns ahead.\n\nCurrent turn 37, so I need to output actions for turn 37, 38, 39, etc., up to say 5 turns.\n\nBut after turn 37, no food, so no score, and I just need to survive.\n\nBut survival might be tricky with the snake body.\n\nAlso, internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nGrid is small, 8x8, snake is 14 or 15 long, so it occupies many cells.\n\nAvailable space: 64 cells minus walls, but walls are borders, so all cells except borders are accessible except internal obstacle.\n\nBorders: x=0,7 and y=0,7 are walls, so the playable area is x from 1 to 6, y from 1 to 6? x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so cells with x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6 are playable? x=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7; x=0 and x=7 walls, so x=1 to 6 are ok, similarly y=1 to 6.\n\ny=0 and y=7 walls, so y=1 to 6.\n\nBut (5,6) is an internal obstacle, so (5,6) is blocked.\n\nSo playable cells: rows y=1 to 6, columns x=1 to 6, except (5,6) obstacle.\n\nSo total cells: 6x6 = 36, minus one obstacle, 35 cells.\n\nSnake is 14 segments long, so 14 occupied, 21 free before turn 37.\n\nAfter turn 37, if I eat, snake 15, 20 free; if not, 14, 21 free.\n\nBut with no food, I can move around without growing, so it's possible to survive indefinitely if there is space, but with snake length 15 and 35 cells, it might be tight, but possible to loop or something.\n\nBut since no food, no score, so for the purpose of this, after eating the food on turn 37, I can just move safely for the next few turns to survive.\n\nSimilarly, if I didn't eat, same thing.\n\nBut since I can get +1 by eating, I should.\n\nNow, for the answer format, I need to output actions for multiple turns.\n\nTurn 37: action\n\nThen turn 38, 39, etc.\n\nSince no food, actions can be arbitrary as long as safe.\n\nBut I need to think ahead to avoid dead ends.\n\nFor example, after moving to (6,4) on turn 37, head at (6,4), direction D.\n\nThen on turn 38, from (6,4), I can move D to (6,3) or L to (5,4).\n\nSince no food, both are fine, but I need to choose.\n\nSimilarly, future moves.\n\nTo maximize survival, I should move to open areas.\n\nCurrent snake: after eating (6,4), positions: head (6,4), then (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nThe body is mostly on the bottom and left.\n\nFree areas: for example, top right or something.\n\n(6,3) is free, (5,4) free, (4,4), etc.\n\nI should move down to (6,3) to go towards the bottom, but bottom has walls.\n\ny=0 wall, so y=1 is the bottom row.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 top.\n\nx=1 left, x=6 right.\n\nAfter turn 37, head at (6,4).\n\nIf I move D to (6,3) on turn 38, head to (6,3), tail moves? No, since no food eaten, tail moves.\n\nAfter turn 37, I ate food, so on turn 38, no food to eat, so when I move, head moves to new position, tail moves one step.\n\nSo positions: after turn 37: head (6,4), body (6,5), (5,5), ..., (6,2) — 15 segments.\n\nOn turn 38, move, say, D to (6,3), no food, so new head (6,3), and tail moves from (6,2) to? The tail was (6,2), but it moves to the previous position of the second last, but in the list, the tail is (6,2), and the segment before tail is (6,1).\n\nPositions: let's index: index 0: (6,4) head, 1: (6,5), 2: (5,5), 3: (4,5), 4: (3,5), 5: (2,5), 6: (2,4), 7: (2,3), 8: (2,2), 9: (2,1), 10: (3,1), 11: (4,1), 12: (5,1), 13: (6,1), 14: (6,2) tail.\n\nWhen no food, head moves to new cell, say (6,3), so new head (6,3), then the body segments shift: segment 0 moves to (6,3), segment 1 was (6,5) becomes the new position of segment 1, but it should be the previous segment 1 becomes segment 2, etc.\n\nStandard: new positions: head to new cell, then each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment.\n\nSo after move to (6,3): new head (6,3), then segment 1: (6,4) (previous head), segment 2: (6,5), segment 3: (5,5), ..., up to segment 14: (6,1) (which was segment 13), and segment 14 (tail) was (6,2), but since tail moves, (6,2) is vacated, and the new tail is (6,1)? Let's list:\n\nNew positions: [ (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) ]\n\nTail is now (6,1).\n\nSimilarly, if I moved L to (5,4) on turn 38, new head (5,4), then (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), etc., down to (6,1), but tail moves so (6,2) gone, new tail (6,1) or something.\n\nBut since no food, it doesn't matter.\n\nTo survive long-term, I need to avoid boxing myself in.\n\nFor example, if I go to (6,3), then from there, I can move to (6,2) or (5,3) or (6,4) but (6,4) is body.\n\nHead at (6,3), direction D (since moved down).\n\nCan move U (opposite, not allowed), D to (6,2), L to (5,3), R to (7,3) wall.\n\n(6,2): is it free? After move, positions have (6,1) and (6,3), not (6,2), so (6,2) free? In the new positions above, after move to (6,3), positions: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), etc., no (6,2), and y=2 is within bounds, so (6,2) free.\n\nSimilarly, (5,3) free.\n\nSo from (6,3), can move D to (6,2) or L to (5,3).\n\nIf move D to (6,2), then head to (6,2), which is above tail? Tail is at (6,1), so (6,2) and (6,1) are adjacent vertically.\n\nBut moving to (6,2) is fine, as long as not colliding.\n\nAfter move, new head (6,2), tail moves, etc.\n\nBut (6,1) is tail, so if I move to (6,2), it might be ok, but let's see.\n\nPerhaps it's safe.\n\nBut to think 5 turns ahead, I need a plan.\n\nSince all food is gone after turn 37, and no new food, the score is fixed after turn 37, so for turns 38 onwards, I just need to survive, and actions can be chosen to avoid death.\n\nFor the answer, I can output turn 37: D, then for subsequent turns, any safe move, but I need to specify.\n\nPerhaps I should output a sequence.\n\nBut the food at (5,4) has value 7, but I can't eat it, so it's gone.\n\nUnless... is there a way it can be eaten later? No, life_span=1, disappears.\n\nSimilarly for (1,3).\n\nSo I think for turn 37, I must move D to eat (6,4) for +1.\n\nThen for turn 38, say move D to (6,3), then turn 39, move L to (5,3), etc.\n\nBut let's make a plan.\n\nFirst, on turn 37: move D to (6,4), eat food, score +1.\n\nNew head direction: down.\n\nPositions: head (6,4), body as above.\n\nTurn 38: from (6,4), possible moves: U not allowed (opposite), D to (6,3), L to (5,4), R wall.\n\nBoth (6,3) and (5,4) are free and safe.\n\nSay I move D to (6,3) for consistency.\n\nNew direction down.\n\nPositions: head (6,3), then (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), ..., (6,1) as before.\n\nTail was (6,2), moved away, so (6,2) free.\n\nTurn 39: from (6,3), move D to (6,2)? (6,2) is free, as above.\n\nMove to (6,2), no food, so head to (6,2), tail moves to (5,1) or something.\n\nCurrent positions before move: head (6,3), body (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1)\n\nTail at (6,1).\n\nMove D to (6,2): (6,2) is free? Yes, not in positions.\n\nSo new head (6,2), then body (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), ..., (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) and tail was (6,1), so when tail moves, it is removed, new tail is the previous second last, which is (5,1)? List: positions after move: head (6,2), then previous head (6,3), then (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) — and (6,1) is gone, new tail (5,1).\n\nPositions: [ (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) ]\n\nTail at (5,1).\n\nDirection down.\n\nTurn 40: from (6,2), can move D to (6,1)? But (6,1) is not free; in positions, (5,1) is tail, but (6,1) is not occupied now? Positions have (6,2), (6,3), etc., and (5,1), not (6,1), so (6,1) is free? y=1, x=6.\n\n(6,1) is free, but is it wall? x=6, y=1, x=6 is not wall, x=7 wall, so (6,1) is playable.\n\nMove D to (6,1): (6,1) free, so possible.\n\nThen new head (6,1), etc.\n\nOr move L to (5,2) or something.\n\nBut (6,1) is adjacent down.\n\nSince direction down, can move D or L or R, but R to (7,2) wall, so D to (6,1) or L to (5,2).\n\n(5,2) free.\n\nBut let's say move D to (6,1).\n\nThen head at (6,1), which was previously occupied, but now free.\n\nNew positions: head (6,1), then (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), ..., (4,1), (5,1) and tail moves from (5,1), so new tail is (4,1)? Positions: [ (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) ] tail at (4,1).\n\nAnd (5,1) is gone.\n\nNow, head at (6,1), direction down.\n\nBut y=1, below is y=0 wall, so cannot move down.\n\nAlso, left to (5,1) but (5,1) is not occupied now, but after move, (5,1) is free? In positions above, (5,1) not there, so (5,1) free.\n\nFrom (6,1), possible moves:\n\nU to (6,2): but (6,2) is body, second segment.\n\nD to (6,0): y=0 wall, invalid.\n\nL to (5,1): (5,1) free, so possible.\n\nR to (7,1) wall, invalid.\n\nDirection previous was D, so cannot move U (opposite).\n\nSo only possible move is L to (5,1).\n\nMust move left to (5,1).\n\nThen on turn 41, head at (5,1), direction L (since moved left).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI can continue, but it's safe.\n\nSimilarly, other paths.\n\nSo for the answer, I can output:\n\nTurn 37: D\n\nThen for turn 38, say D to (6,3)\n\nTurn 39: D to (6,2)\n\nTurn 40: D to (6,1)\n\nTurn 41: L to (5,1)\n\nBut after turn 41, head at (5,1), etc.\n\nBut since no food, it doesn't matter.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if there is negative food, but all food is positive here.\n\nIn the food list, all have positive value, so no negative food.\n\nSo for turn 37, moving D is the best.\n\nBut earlier I thought about the high-value food, but I can't reach it.\n\nPerhaps the life span is for how many turns it will last, but for (5,4,7,1), it might be value=7, life_span=1, or perhaps it's misparsed.\n\nAnother idea: in the input, for (5,4,7,1), it might be x=5,y=4, life_span=7, value=1? But the text says \"Value and Life Span\", and in the core rules, it's value and life span.\n\nBut in the state, it's listed as (6,4,1,1) which is likely (x,y,value,life_span) since (6,4) value 1 life 1.\n\nSimilarly, (5,4,7,1) value 7 life 1? Or (x,y,life_span,value)?\n\nBut the input format says: \" ( (x1,y1), value1, life_span1 ) \"\n\nIn the state, it's written as (6,4,1,1) without commas, but it's (x,y,value,life_span).\n\nSimilarly, (5,4,7,1) value=7, life_span=1.\n\n(1,3,10,1) value=10, life_span=1.\n\nSo all disappear after turn 37.\n\nSo I have to accept that.\n\nTherefore, for turn 37: D\n\nThen for the next turns, I need to provide actions.\n\nSince the problem says \"think 5+ turns ahead\", but for survival, I can just plan a safe path.\n\nTo be thorough, let's output 5 turns: 37 to 41.\n\nBut turn 37 is the current turn, so actions for t=37,38,39,40,41.\n\nFor t=37: D to (6,4)\n\nThen t=38: from (6,4), I can move to (6,3) or (5,4). Say move D to (6,3)\n\nt=39: from (6,3), move D to (6,2) or L to (5,3). Say D to (6,2)\n\nt=40: from (6,2), move to (6,1) or (5,2). But (6,1) is free, move D to (6,1)\n\nt=41: from (6,1), must move L to (5,1) as only choice.\n\nThen from there, I can continue.\n\nBut for the answer, I think up to t=41 is fine.\n\nSince after t=37 no score, actions don't affect score, so any safe sequence is ok.\n\nBut to prioritize survival, moving to open areas.\n\nFor example, on t=38, from (6,4), instead of down, move left to (5,4) to go left.\n\n(5,4) is free after food gone.\n\nMove L to (5,4), then head at (5,4), direction L.\n\nThen from there, I can move to (5,3) or (4,4) or (5,5) but (5,5) body, etc.\n\nBut similar.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo I'll go with moving down for now.\n\nAnother thing: the internal obstacle at (5,6), which might be relevant if I go up.\n\nBut in this path, I'm going down, so not affected.\n\nSo for the answer:\n\nTurn 37: D\n\nTurn 38: D\n\nTurn 39: D\n\nTurn 40: D\n\nTurn 41: L\n\nBut on turn 40, if head at (6,2), moving to (6,1) is down, then on turn 41, must move left to (5,1).\n\nThen turn 42, from (5,1), direction L, can move L to (4,1) or U to (5,2) or D to (5,0) wall, etc.\n\nBut I don't need to output beyond.\n\nFor the box, I think output 5 actions is sufficient.\n\nSince turn 37 is given, actions for turn 37 to, say, 41.\n\nBut the answer format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so for multiple turns.\n\nI think I should start with turn 37.\n\nSo for turn 37: D\n\nThen since I need to think ahead, I'll provide a sequence.\n\nPerhaps I can consider not eating the food to keep the snake shorter, but since no more food, shorter snake might be easier to maneuver, but I lose the +1 score, and the goal is to maximize score, so I should take the +1.\n\nFor example, if I move U on turn 37 to (6,6), no eat, then snake shorter, 14 segments, and I can move around.\n\nBut I get 0 score instead of +1, so worse.\n\nSo definitely eat.\n\nTherefore, final decision.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan for Turn 37 and Beyond\n\n**Current State Summary (Turn 37):**\n- **Grid Size**: 8x8, with walls at borders (x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7) and one internal obstacle at (5,6).\n- **Snake**: \n  - Head at (6,5), moving right (direction R).\n  - Body segments: [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)] (14 segments total).\n  - Tail at (6,2).\n- **Food** (all with life_span=1, disappearing after Turn 37 if not eaten):\n  - (6,4): value=1, life_span=1 (directly below head).\n  - (5,4): value=7, life_span=1 (not reachable in 1 turn).\n  - (1,3): value=10, life_span=1 (not reachable in 1 turn).\n\n**Immediate Decision (Turn 37):**\n- Only reachable food is at (6,4) by moving down (D). Eating it gives +1 score and increases snake length to 15.\n- Moving up (U) to (6,6) avoids eating but scores 0 and misses the only scoring opportunity, as all food disappears after Turn 37.\n- Moving left (L) to (5,5) causes body collision (not the tail). Moving right (R) to (7,5) causes wall collision. Both are invalid.\n- **Tail Reward Danger Check**: Head at (6,5) and tail at (6,2) are not adjacent (distance 3 in y), so eating (6,4) is safe.\n- **Conclusion for Turn 37**: Move down (D) to eat (6,4) for +1 score.\n\n**Post-Turn 37 Situation (No Food):**\n- All food disappears after Turn 37. No new food is indicated, so the score is fixed at +1. The priority shifts to long-term survival by avoiding collisions and dead ends.\n- Snake length is 15 after eating (6,4). The grid has limited space (35 playable cells minus snake occupancy), so movements must avoid boxing the snake in.\n- After Turn 37, head is at (6,4) with direction D. Possible safe paths are evaluated for 5+ turns ahead.\n\n**5-Turn Survival Plan (Turns 38-41):**\n- **Goal**: Navigate to open areas (e.g., center-left grid) to maximize space and avoid walls/obstacles. The snake's body forms a \"U\" shape, so moving downward then left avoids tight spaces.\n- **Turn 38**: From (6,4), direction D. Options: down (D) to (6,3) or left (L) to (5,4). Moving down is chosen to continue away from the dense body area near (6,5)-(6,1) and toward the bottom, where more space exists. (6,3) is free and safe.\n- **Turn 39**: From (6,3), direction D. Options: down (D) to (6,2) or left (L) to (5,3). Moving down to (6,2) is safe and progresses toward the bottom row, aligning with the current direction to minimize turns.\n- **Turn 40**: From (6,2), direction D. Options: down (D) to (6,1) or left (L) to (5,2). (6,1) is free and moving down is consistent, but y=1 is the bottom row (y=0 is wall). This is safe as (6,1) is vacant.\n- **Turn 41**: From (6,1), direction D. Down to (6,0) is invalid (wall). Opposite move (U) is not allowed. Only safe move is left (L) to (5,1), which is free and avoids collision.\n\n**Long-Term Survival Consideration (Beyond 5 Turns):**\n- After Turn 41, head at (5,1) with direction L. Future moves (e.g., left to (4,1) or up to (5,2)) can continue navigating the bottom-left area, which has fewer body segments. The snake can loop or follow the perimeter to survive indefinitely, as no food means no growth and tail movement creates space.\n\n**Risks Mitigated in Plan:**\n- **Collisions Avoided**: All moves are to free cells, with no body or wall collisions.\n- **Direction Reversals Prevented**: No opposite moves (e.g., no U after D).\n- **Dead Ends Prevented**: Moving downward then left avoids the obstacle at (5,6) and the crowded top-right area.\n\n**Action Sequence (Turns 37-41):**\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 37: D (down)  \nTurn 38: D (down)  \nTurn 39: D (down)  \nTurn 40: D (down)  \nTurn 41: L (left)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 38, and I'm playing Snake on a grid from (0,0) to (7,7), since walls are at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. There's also an internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nThe snake positions are given as a list: head is at (6,4), and the body follows: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2). So the tail is at (6,2).\n\nThe head direction is down, which is D, meaning the snake was moving downward to get to (6,4) from (6,5)? Let me think about the movement. Since positions are listed with head first, and the snake was moving down to (6,4), that means before moving, the head was at (6,5), and it moved down to (6,4). But (6,5) is the second position, which is the first body segment.\n\nSnake positions: index 0: head (6,4), index 1: (6,5), index 2: (5,5), and so on. Head direction is D, meaning the current direction of movement is down. So from the previous position, it moved down to (6,4). But the previous head position would have been above (6,4), but since it moved down to (6,4), the previous head was at (6,5), which is now the first body segment.\n\nNow, food positions: there are two food items. One at (5,4) with value 1 and life span 6. That means it will disappear after 6 turns, including this turn, so it has 6 turns left including turn 38. Life span decreases every turn, starting from turn 38.\n\nThe food is given as: (5,4,6,1) – I think this means (x,y, life_span, value). Similarly, (1,3,9,1) is at (1,3) with life span 9, value 1.\n\nBoth are positive food since value is +1.\n\nNow, I need to plan at least 5 turns ahead. So for turns 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, and possibly more if needed, but the answer should show actions for each turn starting from t1.\n\nThe answer format is to box the actions for each turn.\n\nFirst, let's visualize the grid.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7. Walls at borders, so cells where x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nSnake positions: head (6,4), body: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2). Tail is (6,2).\n\nLet me list all snake cells to avoid:\n\n- (6,4) head\n\n- (6,5)\n\n- (5,5)\n\n- (4,5)\n\n- (3,5)\n\n- (2,5)\n\n- (2,4)\n\n- (2,3)\n\n- (2,2)\n\n- (2,1)\n\n- (3,1)\n\n- (4,1)\n\n- (5,1)\n\n- (6,1)\n\n- (6,2) tail\n\nAlso, walls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 cells. And (5,6).\n\nFood at (5,4) and (1,3).\n\nCurrent head direction is D, down. So from (6,4), moving down would go to (6,3), but let's see what's possible.\n\nPossible moves from (6,4):\n\n- Up (U): (6,5) but (6,5) is occupied by the snake body, so collision if I go there.\n\n- Down (D): (6,3) – is this free? Let's check: x=6, y=3. Is it a wall? y=3 is not border, x=6 is not border since border is x=7? Walls: x=0 or x=7, y=0 or y=7. x=6 is not 0 or 7, y=3 not 0 or 7, so not wall. Internal obstacle at (5,6), not (6,3). Snake positions: (6,3) not in list, so (6,3) is empty and safe to move to? But let's confirm the snake body: positions are (6,4), (6,5), etc., no (6,3). So down to (6,3) should be possible.\n\n- Left (L): (5,4) – (5,4) has food, but is it occupied? (5,4) is not in snake positions; snake has (5,5), (4,5), etc., but not (5,4). And (5,4) is a food position, so it should be free except for the food, but the snake can move there to eat it.\n\n- Right (R): (7,4) – but x=7 is a wall, since border x=7, so cannot move right.\n\nx=7 is wall, so (7,4) is invalid.\n\nSo possible moves: U, D, L.\n\nU: to (6,5) – but (6,5) is occupied by snake body, segment 1, so if I move there, head collides with body, dead.\n\nD: to (6,3) – seems free.\n\nL: to (5,4) – has food, but should be free to move to, and eating the food.\n\nBut I need to consider the movement constraints. Head direction is D, down, so I cannot instantly reverse to up, but up is not possible anyway since occupied.\n\nInstant reverse: if current direction is D, I cannot move U on the next turn. But since U is not possible, that's fine.\n\nFrom (6,4), with direction D, I can move L, D, or R, but R is wall, so only L or D possible? U is body, R is wall.\n\nL to (5,4), D to (6,3).\n\nNow, if I move L to (5,4), I eat the food there, since it's positive food, value +1, snake length increases by 1.\n\nFood at (5,4) has life span 6, value 1.\n\nAlso, there's a tail reward danger: if head is adjacent to tail and tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nBut here, tail is at (6,2), head at (6,4), not adjacent. Adjacent means sharing an edge, so (6,4) and (6,2) are not adjacent; they are two cells apart vertically. Adjacent would be same x, y±1 or same y, x±1.\n\nSo (6,4) and (6,2) have |dy|=2, not adjacent.\n\nSimilarly, other body parts.\n\nNow, the tail is at (6,2), and no food there, so no issue.\n\nIf I eat food at (5,4), snake grows, so when I move to (5,4), head is there, and the body extends; the tail doesn't move that turn, I think.\n\nStandard snake mechanics: when you eat food, you grow, so the head moves to the food cell, and a new segment is added where the tail was, but since the tail doesn't move, the snake gets longer.\n\nBut in terms of positions: after moving to (5,4), the new head is (5,4), and the previous positions: the body was from (6,5) to (6,2), but since I ate food, the tail stays, so positions become: head (5,4), then (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), ..., down to (6,2), and a new segment at the old tail position? No.\n\nTypically in snake, when you eat, the head moves to the new cell, and the tail doesn't move, so the snake grows by one cell at the tail end.\n\nSo positions: after move without eating, head moves to new cell, tail moves off the last cell.\n\nAfter move with eating: head moves to new cell (food), tail does not move, so the last segment stays, and a new segment is added at the previous tail position? No.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nAt turn start, snake positions: S = [H, B1, B2, ..., T]\n\nWhen you move to a new cell without food: new head at new position, body shifts, tail is removed, so new positions: [new_head, H, B1, B2, ..., second_last], so tail moves.\n\nWith food: new head at food position, body shifts, but tail is not removed, so new positions: [new_head, H, B1, B2, ..., T], so length increases by one, and the new tail is T, which was the old tail.\n\nIn this case, if I move to (5,4), which has food, so new head at (5,4), previous head (6,4) becomes new body, then (6,5), (5,5), ..., down to (6,2) which is now the tail, but since I ate, the tail stays, so positions: head (5,4), then (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) — same as before but with new head at (5,4) and (6,4) added as body? No.\n\nPrevious positions: [ (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), ..., (6,2) ] — 15 segments.\n\nAfter moving left to (5,4) and eating: new positions: head (5,4), then previous head (6,4) becomes first body segment, then the rest: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2). So now the snake has 16 segments, with tail at (6,2).\n\nSimilarly, if I move down to (6,3), no food there, so new positions: head (6,3), then (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), ..., and tail (6,1) or something? After move without eating, tail moves off.\n\nPrevious tail is (6,2), after move down to (6,3): head to (6,3), then (6,4) as body, then (6,5), (5,5), ..., down to (6,1)? Let's index.\n\nPositions: index 0: (6,4), 1: (6,5), 2: (5,5), 3: (4,5), 4: (3,5), 5: (2,5), 6: (2,4), 7: (2,3), 8: (2,2), 9: (2,1), 10: (3,1), 11: (4,1), 12: (5,1), 13: (6,1), 14: (6,2) tail.\n\nAfter move down to (6,3): new head at (6,3), then the body is the previous head and segments except tail: so [ (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) ] — tail is now (6,1), since (6,2) is gone.\n\nLength same.\n\nBack to turn 38 choices.\n\nI can move L to (5,4) and eat food, or D to (6,3) no food.\n\nBut I need to think ahead 5 turns.\n\nAlso, there's another food at (1,3) with life span 9, so it has more time.\n\nFood at (5,4) has life span 6, meaning it will disappear after turn 38 + 5 = 43? Life span decreases every turn including current, so at turn 38, life span 6, so it will be there for turns 38,39,40,41,42,43? Let's calculate.\n\nLife span N: it disappears after N turns, meaning on turn t + N, it is gone, or after N decreases?\n\nThe rule: \"Disappears after N turns (N = life_span) | Countdown decreases every turn (including current)\"\n\nSo at turn t, life span L, it decreases to L-1 on next turn, and when L=0 after decrease, it disappears.\n\nTypically, at turn t, if life span is L, it will be present for L more turns, including turn t.\n\nSo at turn t, it has life span L, meaning it will disappear after turn t + L - 1 or something.\n\nExample: at turn t, life span N, so on turn t, it is present, life span N.\n\nOn turn t+1, if not eaten, life span becomes N-1.\n\n...\n\nOn turn t + N - 1, life span 1.\n\nOn turn t + N, it disappears, so not present on turn t+N.\n\nFor food at (5,4) at turn 38, life span 6: present on turns 38,39,40,41,42,43? Turn 38: L=6, turn 39: L=5, ..., turn 43: L=1, turn 44: L=0, disappears, so not present on turn 44.\n\nSo it is present from turn 38 to 43 inclusive, 6 turns.\n\nSimilarly, food at (1,3) life span 9, present from turn 38 to 46 inclusive.\n\nNow, I need to plan multiple moves.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid.\n\nI'll sketch a grid from (0,0) to (7,7).\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7. So the playable area is x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6, except internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\n(5,6) is wall, so not accessible.\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead (6,4)\n\nBody: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nSo the snake is mostly on the bottom and left side.\n\nFood: (5,4) and (1,3)\n\n(5,4) is just left of head (6,4), so adjacent.\n\n(1,3) is far left.\n\nNow, current turn 38, head at (6,4), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: L to (5,4) or D to (6,3). U and R not possible.\n\nIf I move L to (5,4), I eat the food, snake grows to 16 segments.\n\nThen new head at (5,4), direction L (since I moved left).\n\nThen from there, possible moves: U, D, L, R, but cannot reverse to right instantly.\n\nNew head position (5,4), direction L.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nU: (5,5) - but (5,5) is occupied by snake body (third segment, index 2: (5,5)), so collision.\n\nD: (5,3) - let's see if free. (5,3) not in snake positions? Snake has (5,5), (5,1), but no (5,3) or (5,4) now head, (5,5) body. (5,3) should be free. Not wall.\n\nL: (4,4) - free? Not in snake positions, snake has (4,5), (4,1), no (4,4). Walls? x=4,y=4 not border.\n\nR: (6,4) - but (6,4) is now the first body segment, since head moved to (5,4), and (6,4) is second position, so occupied, collision.\n\nAlso, cannot move R because reverse, but it's occupied anyway.\n\nSo from (5,4) after moving left, possible moves: D to (5,3) or L to (4,4).\n\nU and R not possible.\n\nIf I move D to (5,3), no food, or L to (4,4), no food there.\n\nBut I need to think about the other food and survival.\n\nIf at turn 38 I move down to (6,3) instead.\n\nThen new head at (6,3), direction D.\n\nThen possible moves from (6,3): U, D, L, R.\n\nU: (6,4) - but (6,4) is now the first body segment (after move, positions: head (6,3), body (6,4), (6,5), etc.), so (6,4) occupied, collision if move up.\n\nD: (6,2) - (6,2) is the tail, but after move to (6,3) without eating, tail moves off, so positions: head (6,3), then (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), ..., down to (6,1) or let's list.\n\nAfter move down to (6,3) no eat: new positions: head (6,3), then previous head (6,4) as body, then (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) — and (6,2) is gone, so tail at (6,1).\n\n(6,2) was tail, but since no eat, it moved off, so new tail is (6,1).\n\nSo (6,2) is free now.\n\nThus from (6,3), direction D.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nU: (6,4) - occupied by body, collision.\n\nD: (6,2) - now free, since tail moved, so can move down to (6,2).\n\nL: (5,3) - free, not occupied.\n\nR: (7,3) - wall, x=7, invalid.\n\nSo possible: D to (6,2) or L to (5,3).\n\n(5,3) might be empty or have food? Food at (5,4) is there, but (5,3) no food.\n\nFood at (5,4) and (1,3), so (5,3) empty.\n\nNow, compare the two choices at turn 38.\n\nOption 1: Move L to (5,4) at turn 38, eat food.\n\nThen at turn 39, from (5,4), I can move D to (5,3) or L to (4,4).\n\nIf I move D to (5,3), then head at (5,3), direction D.\n\nThen possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nU: (5,4) - but (5,4) is previous head, now body, occupied.\n\nD: (5,2) - free? Not occupied, not wall.\n\nL: (4,3) - free.\n\nR: (6,3) - free? Not occupied, or snake? Snake positions after turn 39 move: let's track.\n\nAfter turn 38: moved L to (5,4) ate, so positions: head (5,4), body (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) tail.\n\nThen turn 39, move D to (5,3): head to (5,3), eat? (5,3) no food, so no eat. New positions: head (5,3), then (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) — tail (6,2) moved off, so new tail (6,1).\n\n(6,2) is gone.\n\nNow head at (5,3), direction D.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nU: (5,4) - occupied, body.\n\nD: (5,2) - free, not wall, not snake.\n\nL: (4,3) - free.\n\nR: (6,3) - free, not occupied.\n\nSo can move D, L, or R.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 39 from (5,4) I move L to (4,4), then head at (4,4), direction L.\n\nThen possible moves from (4,4): U, D, L, R.\n\nU: (4,5) - but (4,5) is body segment (index 3 or something, after positions: head (4,4), then (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), etc. (4,5) is body, occupied.\n\nD: (4,3) - free.\n\nL: (3,4) - free.\n\nR: (5,4) - occupied, body.\n\nCannot reverse to R.\n\nSo possible D or L.\n\nBut let's think about the food at (5,4) which has limited life. If I don't eat it now, it might be eaten later or disappear.\n\nBut at turn 38, if I don't eat it, it will be there for a few more turns.\n\nAlso, there's food at (1,3) which is farther.\n\nI need to survive and eat both if possible.\n\nAnother thing: the snake is long, 15 segments, and the grid is 6x6 playable? x1-6, y1-6, but with obstacle at (5,6), so 35 cells? 6x6=36 minus one obstacle, 35 cells, snake has 15, so 20 free, but with food.\n\nAfter eating, 16 segments, less space.\n\nBut I need to avoid dead ends.\n\nLet me see the current map.\n\nList all occupied cells.\n\nWalls: all x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and (5,6).\n\nSnake: (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2)\n\nFree cells: for example, (1,1) to (1,6) except (1,3) has food? (1,3) food, so not free but can be moved to.\n\n(1,1), (1,2), (1,3) food, (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)\n\n(2,6), (3,6), (4,6), but (5,6) wall, (6,6) wall? y=6 is border? y=7 is wall, y=0 wall, so y=6 is not wall, x=6 not wall.\n\nGrid: x from 0 to 7, but x=0 and x=7 are walls, so playable x=1 to 6.\n\nSimilarly y=1 to 6.\n\ny=0 and y=7 walls.\n\nSo cells: x=1 to 6, y=1 to 6.\n\nExcept internal wall at (5,6).\n\nSo (5,6) is wall.\n\nNow, snake occupies:\n\nRow y=5: (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5) all occupied\n\ny=4: (2,4), (6,4) head, but (6,4) is head, occupied.\n\nList all:\n\n(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n\n(3,1), (3,5)\n\n(4,1), (4,5)\n\n(5,1), (5,5)\n\n(6,1), (6,2), (6,4), (6,5)\n\nAnd (6,3) is free if not moved.\n\nFree cells: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) food, (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)\n\n(2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (4,6) not wall, but (5,6) wall, so (4,6) free, (3,6) free, (2,6) free\n\n(3,2), (3,3), (3,4) free\n\n(4,2), (4,3), (4,4) free\n\n(5,2), (5,3), (5,4) food\n\n(6,3) free\n\n(3,2) etc.\n\nFood at (5,4) and (1,3).\n\nIf I eat (5,4) at turn 38, I get +1, but then I might be in a position where it's hard to reach the other food or avoid starvation.\n\nIf I don't eat it, I can go down to (6,3), then to (6,2) or (5,3), and perhaps eat (5,4) later from below or something.\n\nBut (5,4) has only 6 turns life, from 38 to 43, so I have time.\n\nAt turn 38, after move to (6,3), (5,4) is still there.\n\nThen from (6,3), I can move L to (5,3) at turn 39.\n\nThen at (5,3), I can move U to (5,4) to eat it, or other directions.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nFirst, let's consider not eating at turn 38.\n\nTurn 38: move D to (6,3)\n\nNew positions: head (6,3), body (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) tail at (6,1)\n\nDirection D.\n\nTurn 39: from (6,3), can move D to (6,2) or L to (5,3)\n\n(6,2) is free now.\n\nIf move D to (6,2), then head at (6,2), direction D.\n\nThen positions: head (6,2), body (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), etc. down to (5,1), (6,1)? Previous tail (6,1) moved off, so body: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) — tail at (5,1)\n\n(6,1) is gone.\n\nFrom (6,2), possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nU: (6,3) occupied, body.\n\nD: (6,1) but (6,1) is now free? After move to (6,2), positions have (6,1) not occupied, but (6,1) is below, y=1, not wall.\n\n(6,1) was tail, but moved off, so free.\n\nD: (6,1) free.\n\nL: (5,2) free? Not occupied.\n\nR: (7,2) wall, invalid.\n\nSo can move D or L.\n\nBut moving D to (6,1) is corner, might be risky.\n\nIf at turn 39 from (6,3) I move L to (5,3)\n\nThen head at (5,3), direction L (since moved left from (6,3)).\n\nPositions: head (5,3), body (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), etc. down to (5,1) tail.\n\n(6,1) is gone, tail at (5,1).\n\nFrom (5,3), direction L.\n\nPossible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nU: (5,4) - has food, and not occupied? (5,4) is free except food, so can move to eat.\n\nD: (5,2) free.\n\nL: (4,3) free.\n\nR: (6,3) occupied, body, collision.\n\nCannot reverse to R.\n\nSo can move U, D, or L.\n\nIf I move U to (5,4), I eat the food at turn 39.\n\nThen new positions: head (5,4), then (5,3)? After move to (5,3) at turn 39 without eat, positions: head (5,3), body (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) tail.\n\nThen move U to (5,4) and eat, so new head (5,4), then body (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) and tail stays, so new tail at (5,1), but since ate, tail doesn't move, so positions: [ (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) ] 16 segments.\n\nThen from there, head at (5,4), direction U (since moved up).\n\nThen possible moves.\n\nBut I also have the food at (1,3) to consider.\n\nIf at turn 38 I eat (5,4), I get the point now, but then I'm at (5,4) with a long snake, and I need to go to (1,3).\n\nFrom (5,4), after eating, at turn 39 I can move to (4,4) or (5,3).\n\nLet's say I move to (4,4) at turn 39.\n\nThen head at (4,4), direction L (if I moved left from (5,4), but at turn 38 I moved L to (5,4), so direction L.\n\nThen at turn 39, from (5,4) I move L to (4,4), so direction L.\n\nHead at (4,4), direction L.\n\nThen possible moves: U, D, L, R.\n\nU: (4,5) - occupied by body (index 4 or something, in positions after turn 38 eat: [ (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), ... ] so (4,5) is body, occupied.\n\nD: (4,3) - free.\n\nL: (3,4) - free.\n\nR: (5,4) - occupied, body.\n\nCannot reverse.\n\nSo can move D or L.\n\nIf move L to (3,4), then to (2,4) or (3,3), etc.\n\nBut (2,4) is body, occupied.\n\nFrom (3,4), can move down to (3,3) or left to (2,4) but (2,4) occupied.\n\nPositions after turn 39 move to (4,4): head (4,4), body (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) and (6,2) tail? After turn 38 eat, tail at (6,2), then turn 39 move to (4,4) no eat, so tail moves off.\n\nAfter turn 38: positions with 16 segments: head (5,4), body (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) tail.\n\nTurn 39 move L to (4,4) no food, so new head (4,4), body (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) — tail (6,2) moved off, so new tail (5,1).\n\nHead at (4,4), direction L.\n\nPossible moves:\nU: (4,5) occupied (body)\nD: (4,3) free\nL: (3,4) free\nR: (5,4) occupied\n\nSo D or L.\n\nIf move L to (3,4), then head at (3,4), direction L.\n\nThen from there, U: (3,5) occupied (body), D: (3,3) free, L: (2,4) occupied (body), R: (4,4) occupied, so only D to (3,3) possible.\n\nThen at (3,3), can move to (3,2) or (4,3) etc.\n\nBut this is getting messy.\n\nI need to think about the food at (1,3).\n\n(1,3) has life span 9, so I have until turn 46 to eat it.\n\nThe snake is currently on the right and bottom, so I need to move left to reach (1,3).\n\nIf I eat the food at (5,4) now, I grow, which might make it harder to maneuver in the tight spaces on the left.\n\nIf I don't eat it, I can go down and left, then come back for (5,4) later or go directly to (1,3).\n\nBut (5,4) will disappear soon if not eaten.\n\nLife span 6, so it will be gone by turn 44.\n\nTurn 38 to 43 present.\n\nAt turn 38, if I move down to (6,3), then at turn 39 I can move to (5,3), then at turn 40 to (5,4) to eat it.\n\nThat way, I eat it at turn 40, which is fine, and I have more space.\n\nAt turn 38, move D to (6,3) no eat.\n\nThen turn 39, from (6,3) move L to (5,3) no eat.\n\nPositions after turn 39: head (5,3), body (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) tail.\n\nThen turn 40, from (5,3) move U to (5,4) and eat.\n\nNew head (5,4), then body (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) and tail stays, so positions: [ (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) ] 16 segments.\n\nHead direction U.\n\nThen from there, I can move to access the left side.\n\nFor example, from (5,4), I can move L to (4,4) or D to (5,2) etc., but (5,3) is body now.\n\nPossible moves from (5,4) after turn 40: U: (5,5) occupied (body), D: (5,3) occupied (body), L: (4,4) free, R: (6,4) occupied (body), so only L to (4,4) possible.\n\nThen move to (4,4), then from there to (4,3) or (3,4), etc.\n\nNow, to reach (1,3), I need to go left.\n\nThe area around (1,3) has some free cells: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), and (2,6), (3,6), etc.\n\nBut the snake body is at (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), so row y=2 is mostly occupied except (2,6) free.\n\n(2,3) is body, so I can't go to (2,3) from head.\n\nFrom the left area, I can approach from above or below.\n\nFor example, from (3,3) or (3,4), but (3,4) might be free.\n\nAfter turn 40, positions have (3,5), (2,5), etc.\n\nIf I am at (4,4) after turn 41, say.\n\nTurn 40: head at (5,4) after eating.\n\nTurn 41: move L to (4,4) no food, so new head (4,4), body (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), etc. down to (5,1) tail.\n\nTail was (5,1), but no eat, so it moves off? After turn 40 eat, positions have tail at (5,1), then turn 41 move to (4,4) no eat, so tail moves, new positions: head (4,4), body (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) — tail (5,1) moved off, so new tail (4,1).\n\n(5,1) gone.\n\nHead at (4,4), direction L (moved left from (5,4)).\n\nPossible moves: U: (4,5) occupied (body), D: (4,3) free, L: (3,4) free, R: (5,4) occupied.\n\nSo D or L.\n\nIf move L to (3,4), head at (3,4), direction L.\n\nThen U: (3,5) occupied, D: (3,3) free, L: (2,4) occupied, R: (4,4) occupied, so only D to (3,3).\n\nMove to (3,3), then from (3,3), U: (3,4) occupied, D: (3,2) free, L: (2,3) occupied, R: (4,3) free, so can move D or R.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nTo reach (1,3), I can go to (3,3), then (3,2), then (3,1) but (3,1) is body, or (2,2) occupied.\n\nFrom (3,3), move D to (3,2), which is free.\n\nThen head at (3,2), direction D.\n\nThen U: (3,3) occupied, D: (3,1) but (3,1) is body, occupied, L: (2,2) occupied, R: (4,2) free.\n\nSo only R to (4,2).\n\nThen to (4,2), then to (4,1) but (4,1) body, or (4,3), etc.\n\nIt seems difficult to reach (1,3) because the left side is blocked by the snake body.\n\nThe body is at (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), and (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), so the bottom row is mostly occupied except (1,1) and (1,2).\n\n(1,1) and (1,2) are free.\n\n(1,3) has food.\n\nTo eat (1,3), I need to approach from (1,2), (1,4), or (2,3), but (2,3) is occupied, so only (1,2) or (1,4).\n\n(1,4) is free.\n\nSo I can go to (1,4) or (1,2) first.\n\nBut how to get there?\n\nFrom the current position, if I go down to (6,3) at turn 38, then to (5,3) at turn 39, then to (5,4) at turn 40 to eat, then I'm at (5,4), then to (4,4), then to (3,4), but (3,4) is free, then to (3,3), then to (3,2), then to (4,2), etc., not directly to left.\n\nI can go up.\n\nFor example, after eating at (5,4) at turn 40, I am at (5,4), only move L to (4,4) at turn 41.\n\nThen from (4,4), I can move D to (4,3) or L to (3,4).\n\nIf I move L to (3,4) at turn 41, then only move D to (3,3) at turn 42.\n\nThen from (3,3), I can move D to (3,2) or R to (4,3).\n\nIf I move to (3,2) at turn 42, then only move R to (4,2) at turn 43.\n\nThen from (4,2), I can move U to (4,3) or R to (5,2) or D to (4,1) but (4,1) body, occupied.\n\n(4,1) is body, so not.\n\nU to (4,3) free, R to (5,2) free, D to (4,1) occupied.\n\nSo U or R.\n\nIf I move U to (4,3), then from (4,3), I can move to (4,4) but occupied, or (4,2) just left, or (3,3) or (5,3).\n\nBut I need to go to (1,3).\n\nIt's taking many turns, and (1,3) life span is long, but I might run out of space or hit myself.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 38, instead of moving down or left, but only those are possible.\n\nOr, I can move down at turn 38 to (6,3), then at turn 39 move down to (6,2), then at turn 40 move left to (5,2), etc.\n\nBut similar issue.\n\nPerhaps I should not eat the food at (5,4) at all, and go directly for (1,3), but (5,4) is close and positive, so it's good to eat it if possible.\n\nBut if I eat it, I grow, making it harder to move in the confined space.\n\nIf I don't eat it, I can have more flexibility.\n\nAt turn 38, move D to (6,3) no eat.\n\nThen turn 39, from (6,3) move L to (5,3) no eat.\n\nThen turn 40, from (5,3) I can move U to (5,4) to eat, or move D to (5,2) or L to (4,3).\n\nIf I move U to (5,4), I eat as before.\n\nIf I move D to (5,2), no eat, then head at (5,2), direction D.\n\nThen positions: head (5,2), body (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), etc.\n\nThen from there, I can move to (5,1) but (5,1) is body, occupied, or (4,2), or (6,2), or (5,3) occupied.\n\nU: (5,3) occupied, D: (5,1) occupied, L: (4,2) free, R: (6,2) free? (6,2) might be free.\n\nAfter turn 40 move to (5,2): previous positions at turn 39: head (5,3), body (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) tail.\n\nMove to (5,2) no eat, so new head (5,2), body (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) — tail (5,1) moved off, so new tail (4,1).\n\n(5,1) gone.\n\nHead at (5,2), direction D.\n\nPossible moves:\nU: (5,3) occupied\nD: (5,1) but (5,1) is gone, free? Not occupied, but (5,1) was tail, moved off, so free.\nL: (4,2) free\nR: (6,2) free\n\nSo can move D, L, or R.\n\nIf I move L to (4,2), then I can start going left.\n\nBut I still have the food at (5,4) which will disappear soon.\n\nAt turn 40, if I don't eat it, it has life span decreasing, at turn 40, life span 4 left? At turn 38, L=6, turn 39 L=5, turn 40 L=4, so still present until turn 43.\n\nBut I can eat it later.\n\nBut from (5,2), I can go to (4,2), then to (3,2), etc.\n\n(3,2) is free.\n\nThen to (2,2) but (2,2) is body, occupied.\n\nPositions have (2,2) body.\n\nSo from (4,2), I can move U to (4,3) or L to (3,2) or D to (4,1) occupied or R to (5,2) occupied.\n\nD to (4,1) occupied, so U, L, or R, but R is previous.\n\nAfter move to (4,2), direction L.\n\nU: (4,3) free, L: (3,2) free, D: (4,1) occupied, R: (5,2) occupied.\n\nSo U or L.\n\nIf move L to (3,2), then head at (3,2), direction L.\n\nThen U: (3,3) free, D: (3,1) occupied (body), L: (2,2) occupied, R: (4,2) occupied, so only U to (3,3).\n\nThen at (3,3), U: (3,4) free, D: (3,2) occupied, L: (2,3) occupied, R: (4,3) free.\n\nSo U or R.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nTo reach (1,3), I can go to (1,4) or (1,2).\n\nFor example, from (3,4) I can move L to (2,4) but (2,4) occupied, or U to (3,5) occupied, or R to (4,4), or D to (3,3).\n\nNot direct.\n\nI can go to the top row.\n\nFor example, (1,6), (2,6), etc. are free.\n\nSo if I go up to y=6.\n\nFor example, from current position, at turn 38 move D to (6,3), then turn 39 move L to (5,3), then turn 40 move U to (5,4) eat, then turn 41 move L to (4,4), then turn 42 move L to (3,4), then turn 43 move U to (3,5) but (3,5) occupied, not possible.\n\nFrom (3,4) after turn 42, only move D to (3,3) as before.\n\nFrom (4,4) at turn 41, I can move D to (4,3) instead of L.\n\nThen at (4,3), I can move U to (4,4) occupied, D to (4,2) free, L to (3,3) free, R to (5,3) free.\n\nThen to (3,3), etc.\n\nStill not reaching (1,3).\n\nPerhaps I need to avoid eating the food at (5,4) to keep the snake shorter for now.\n\nAt turn 38, move D to (6,3) no eat.\n\nTurn 39, move L to (5,3) no eat.\n\nTurn 40, instead of moving U to (5,4), move D to (5,2) no eat.\n\nThen head at (5,2), as above.\n\nThen from (5,2), move L to (4,2) no eat.\n\nThen head at (4,2), direction L.\n\nThen move L to (3,2) no eat.\n\nHead at (3,2), direction L.\n\nThen move U to (3,3) no eat.\n\nHead at (3,3), direction U.\n\nThen move U to (3,4) no eat.\n\nHead at (3,4), direction U.\n\nThen move L? (2,4) occupied, not possible.\n\nFrom (3,4), can move R to (4,4) or D to (3,3) occupied.\n\nOnly R to (4,4) or if available U to (3,5) occupied, so only R.\n\nNot progress.\n\nFrom (3,3), after moving U from (3,2), at (3,3), I can move R to (4,3) instead of U.\n\nThen to (4,3), then to (4,4) or (4,2) or (3,3) occupied, or (5,3).\n\nThen to (4,4), etc.\n\nStill not to left.\n\nPerhaps I need to go to (2,6) or something.\n\nLet's list a path to (1,3).\n\nFor example, from current, go to (6,3), then (5,3), then (5,2), then (4,2), then (3,2), then (3,3), then (3,4), then (4,4), but not left.\n\nFrom (3,2), I can move U to (3,3), then from (3,3) move U to (3,4), then from (3,4) I can only move R to (4,4) since L and U occupied.\n\nThen from (4,4) move U to (4,5) but (4,5) occupied, or D to (4,3), etc.\n\nDead end.\n\nThe only way to (1,3) is via (1,2) or (1,4), and (1,2) and (1,4) are free, but I need to reach them.\n\nFor example, from (2,6) I can go down to (2,5) but occupied, or to (1,6) to (1,5) to (1,4) to (1,3).\n\nSo if I can reach (2,6) or (1,6).\n\n(2,6) is free, (1,6) free, (1,5) free, (1,4) free, (1,3) food, (1,2) free, (1,1) free.\n\nSo I can go to (1,6) then down to (1,5), (1,4), then to (1,3).\n\nBut how to get to (1,6).\n\nFrom the current position, I can go up.\n\nBut the snake is blocking the bottom.\n\nAt turn 38, if I move down to (6,3), then turn 39 move down to (6,2), then turn 40 move left to (5,2), then turn 41 move left to (4,2), then turn 42 move up to (4,3), then turn 43 move left to (3,3), then turn 44 move up to (3,4), then turn 45 move left to (2,4) but occupied, not possible.\n\nFrom (3,3) at turn 44, move up to (3,4), then from (3,4) move right? Not left.\n\nI think it's impossible to reach (1,3) with the current snake position because the body is blocking the left side, and the snake is long, so I can't go around.\n\nUnless I move the tail away.\n\nThe tail is at (6,1) or something, but as I move, the tail moves, freeing space.\n\nFor example, at turn 38, if I move D to (6,3), then positions: head (6,3), body (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) tail.\n\nTail at (6,1).\n\nIf I move down to (6,2) at turn 39, then head (6,2), body (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) tail.\n\nThen at turn 40, move L to (5,2), head (5,2), body (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) tail.\n\nThen turn 41, move L to (4,2), head (4,2), body (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1) tail.\n\nThen turn 42, move U to (4,3), head (4,3), body (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1) and since no eat, tail (3,1) moved off, so new positions: head (4,3), body (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1) — tail at (2,1).\n\n(3,1) gone.\n\nHead at (4,3), direction U.\n\nPossible moves: U: (4,4) free, D: (4,2) occupied, L: (3,3) free, R: (5,3) free.\n\nSo U, L, or R.\n\nThen I can move L to (3,3), then U to (3,4), then L to (2,4) but (2,4) occupied, not possible.\n\nMove U to (4,4) from (4,3), then to (3,4) or (4,5) occupied.\n\nFrom (4,4), U: (4,5) occupied, D: (4,3) occupied, L: (3,4) free, R: (5,4) free.\n\nSo L or R.\n\nIf move L to (3,4), then only D to (3,3) or U to (3,5) occupied, so D to (3,3).\n\nThen same as before.\n\nI think the snake is trapped in the right-bottom area, and it's hard to reach the left-top because the body blocks the way.\n\nPerhaps at turn 38, I should move L to (5,4) and eat the food, then I have to deal with the growth, but maybe I can use the food to grow and then move.\n\nBut the problem is the same.\n\nAnother idea: the food at (5,4) can be eaten later, but I have to eat it within its life.\n\nBut since I'm having trouble reaching (1,3), maybe I should focus on survival and eat available food.\n\nBut both foods are positive, so I should try to eat both.\n\nLet's calculate the distance.\n\nFrom head (6,4) to (1,3): |dx|=5, |dy|=1, so Manhattan distance 6.\n\nWith the body, it might take more turns.\n\nFood at (1,3) life span 9, so I have 9 turns to eat it, from turn 38 to 46.\n\nAt turn 38, I can start moving left.\n\nBut from (6,4), I can only move L or D.\n\nIf I move L to (5,4) and eat, then I'm at (5,4), and I can only move L to (4,4) next turn.\n\nThen from (4,4) move L to (3,4), then D to (3,3), then to (3,2), etc., as before.\n\nIf at turn 38 I move D to (6,3), then to (5,3), then to (5,4) at turn 40, then to (4,4) at turn 41, then to (3,4) at turn 42, then to (3,3) at turn 43, then to (3,2) at turn 44, then to (4,2) at turn 45, then to (4,3) at turn 46, but (1,3) is at (1,3), still far, and at turn 46, if I don't eat, it disappears on turn 47, so I have until turn 46 to eat it.\n\nBut at turn 45, I am at (4,2), then to (4,3), not to (1,3).\n\nFrom (3,2) at turn 44, I can move to (3,1) but occupied, or to (2,2) occupied, or to (4,2), so no.\n\nI think it's impossible to reach (1,3) within the time with the current snake position.\n\nPerhaps I can go via the top.\n\nFor example, from (6,4), move D to (6,3), then to (6,2), then to (5,2), then to (4,2), then to (3,2), then to (3,3), then to (3,4), then to (4,4), but not up.\n\nFrom (3,2) move U to (3,3), then U to (3,4), then from (3,4) move R to (4,4), then U to (4,5) occupied, not possible.\n\nSo I cannot reach y=6 or x=1 easily.\n\nThe only free cells on left are (1,1) to (1,6), but I can't reach them because the body blocks at x=2, y=1 to 5.\n\nTo free the left side, I need to move the snake away, but with the tail at the bottom, as I move, the tail moves, but the body is fixed for now.\n\nFor example, if I move down and right, but right is wall.\n\nAt turn 38, move D to (6,3), then turn 39 move D to (6,2), then turn 40 move D to (6,1), but (6,1) is tail or free.\n\nAfter turn 39 move to (6,2), positions head (6,2), body (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) tail.\n\nThen move D to (6,1), (6,1) is free, so move to (6,1), head at (6,1), direction D.\n\nThen positions: head (6,1), body (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) — tail (5,1) moved off, new tail (4,1).\n\nHead at (6,1), direction D.\n\nPossible moves: U: (6,2) occupied, D: (6,0) but y=0 wall, invalid, L: (5,1) free, R: (7,1) wall, so only L to (5,1).\n\nMove to (5,1), then from (5,1), U: (5,2) free, D: wall or invalid, L: (4,1) occupied, R: (6,1) occupied, so only U to (5,2).\n\nThen to (5,2), then to (5,3), etc., similar to before.\n\nNot helping.\n\nI think for long-term survival, I should eat the available food at (5,4) now to gain score, and then try to man  \"maneuver\" to avoid starvation.\n\nBut the grid is small, and snake is long, so I might hit myself soon.\n\nPerhaps there is a way to create space by moving in a circle, but with the obstacle, it's tight.\n\nLet's count free cells.\n\nGrid: 6x6 = 36 cells, minus one obstacle (5,6), so 35 cells.\n\nSnake has 15 segments, so 20 free cells including food.\n\nFood at (5,4) and (1,3), so 18 empty cells.\n\nAfter eating one food, snake 16, free 19 minus one food, 18 empty, etc.\n\nBut with the body positions, the free cells are scattered.\n\nFor example, the top-left area (1,1) to (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), etc.\n\nFrom head, if I move to (5,4) and eat, then to (4,4), then to (4,3), then to (4,2), then to (5,2), then to (5,3), then to (5,4) but occupied, or to (6,3), etc.\n\nBut I can circle around the bottom-right.\n\nFor example, after eating at (5,4), at turn 39 move to (4,4), turn 40 move to (4,3), turn 41 move to (4,2), turn 42 move to (5,2), turn 43 move to (5,3), turn 44 move to (6,3), turn 45 move to (6,2), turn 46 move to (6,1), turn 47 move to (5,1), but (5,1) might be body or free.\n\nBut this is just surviving, not eating the other food.\n\nAnd (1,3) will disappear at turn 47, so I can't eat it.\n\nLife span 9 from turn 38, so at turn 46 it is present, turn 47 gone.\n\nSo I have until turn 46 to eat it.\n\nBut with the above path, I'm not going left.\n\nI think for this state, it's better to eat the close food at (5,4) to gain the point, and then try to survive as long as possible, since reaching (1,3) seems infeasible.\n\nPerhaps the AI can find a way, but from the simulation, it looks difficult.\n\nAnother thought: at turn 38, move L to (5,4) and eat.\n\nThen at turn 39, move D to (5,3) (since from (5,4) U and R occupied, L and D possible, move D to (5,3)).\n\nThen at (5,3), move L to (4,3) or D to (5,2) or R to (6,3).\n\n etc.\n\nBut still not to left.\n\nI think I should accept that (1,3) is not reachable in time, so eat the available food.\n\nSo at turn 38, move L to (5,4) and eat the food.\n\nThen for turn 39, from (5,4), I can move D to (5,3) or L to (4,4).\n\nTo go left, move L to (4,4).\n\nThen turn 40, from (4,4) move D to (4,3) or L to (3,4).\n\nMove L to (3,4).\n\nThen turn 41, from (3,4) move D to (3,3).\n\nThen turn 42, from (3,3) move D to (3,2) or R to (4,3).\n\nMove D to (3,2).\n\nThen turn 43, from (3,2) move R to (4,2) (only choice).\n\nThen turn 44, from (4,2) move U to (4,3) or R to (5,2) or D to (4,1) occupied, so U or R.\n\n etc.\n\nBut I need to output 5 turns.\n\nAlso, for the food at (1,3), I can try to go to (3,6) or something, but it's far.\n\nAt turn 38, move L to (5,4) eat.\n\nTurn 39, move D to (5,3) no eat.\n\nTurn 40, move L to (4,3) no eat.\n\nTurn 41, move U to (4,4) but occupied or not.\n\nAfter turn 40: at turn 39 moved to (5,3), positions head (5,3), body (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), etc. down to (6,2) tail.\n\nThen move L to (4,3), head (4,3), body (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) but after move no eat, tail moved off, so new positions: head (4,3), body (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) — tail (6,2) gone, new tail (6,1).\n\nHead at (4,3), direction L.\n\nThen move U to (4,4) free, D to (4,2) free, L to (3,3) free, R to (5,3) occupied.\n\nSo U, D, or L.\n\nIf I move U to (4,4), then from there, I can move to (3,4) or (4,5) occupied, etc.\n\nBut for the answer, I need to provide actions for turn 38 to at least 42.\n\nSince the instruction says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", and \"prioritize long-term survival\", I should avoid risks.\n\nAt turn 38, moving L to (5,4) is safe, and I get the food.\n\nMoving D to (6,3) is also safe, and I can eat the food later.\n\nBut moving D might be better for short term flexibility.\n\nBut both are safe for now.\n\nLet's see if there is a risk.\n\nIf I move D to (6,3), then at turn 39 I can move to (6,2) or (5,3), both safe.\n\nThen at turn 40, from (5,3) I can move to (5,4) to eat.\n\nSo I can eat at turn 40.\n\nSimilarly, if I move L at 38, I eat at 38.\n\nFor long-term, eating at 40 might give me more space to move for the other food, but as we saw, it's hard.\n\nPerhaps I should check if (5,4) can be eaten from below later.\n\nAt turn 38, move D to (6,3).\n\nTurn 39, move L to (5,3).\n\nTurn 40, move U to (5,4) eat.\n\nThen the same as eating at 38.\n\nSo no difference.\n\nAt turn 38, move D to (6,3), then turn 39 move D to (6,2), then turn 40 move L to (5,2), then turn 41 move U to (5,3), then turn 42 move U to (5,4) eat.\n\nBut at turn 42, the food at (5,4) has life span 6-4=2 at turn 40? Turn 38 L=6, turn 39 L=5, turn 40 L=4, turn 41 L=3, turn 42 L=2, so still there, turn 43 L=1, turn 44 gone.\n\nSo I can eat at turn 42.\n\nBut I delayed eating, but the snake is shorter for two turns, so more space to move.\n\nFor example, from turn 38 to 40, snake length 15, after eating at 40, 16.\n\nWhereas if eat at 38, length 16 from turn 39 on.\n\nSo for reaching (1,3), shorter snake might help.\n\nAt turn 40 after eating at (5,4), I am at (5,4), then I can move L to (4,4) at turn 41, then L to (3,4) at turn 42, then D to (3,3) at turn 43, then to (3,2) at turn 44, then to (4,2) at turn 45, then to (4,3) at turn 46.\n\nAt turn 46, I am at (4,3), and (1,3) is still there if I can reach it, but I can't in one move.\n\nFrom (4,3) at turn 46, I can move L to (3,3), but (3,3) might be occupied or not, but in the path, at turn 43 I was at (3,3), then moved to (3,2), so at turn 46 (3,3) might be free.\n\nBut from (4,3) at turn 46, move L to (3,3), then at turn 47 (1,3) gone, so I can't eat it.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nTherefore, the best is to eat the close food at (5,4) and forget about (1,3) for now.\n\nSo for turn 38, move L to (5,4) to eat.\n\nThen for the next turns, move to stay alive.\n\nFor example, turn 39: from (5,4) move L to (4,4) (since D and L possible, move L to go left or D to down.\n\nMove L to (4,4).\n\nTurn 40: from (4,4) move D to (4,3) or L to (3,4).\n\nMove D to (4,3).\n\nTurn 41: from (4,3) move D to (4,2) or L to (3,3) or R to (5,3).\n\nMove D to (4,2).\n\nTurn 42: from (4,2) move U to (4,3) occupied or R to (5,2) or L to (3,2) or D to (4,1) occupied.\n\nU to (4,3) may be occupied depending on previous, but in path, at turn 41 I moved to (4,3)? Turn 40 at (4,4) move D to (4,3), so at turn 40 head at (4,3), then turn 41 move D to (4,2), so at turn 41 head (4,2), body (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), etc.\n\nThen at turn 42, from (4,2), U: (4,3) occupied, D: (4,1) occupied (body), L: (3,2) free, R: (5,2) free.\n\nSo move L to (3,2) or R to (5,2).\n\nSay move L to (3,2).\n\nThen turn 43: from (3,2) move U to (3,3) or R to (4,2) occupied, or D to (3,1) occupied, so only U to (3,3).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nFor the answer, I need to provide actions for turn 38 to at least 42.\n\nSince the food at (5,4) is valuable and close, I think move L at turn 38.\n\nThen for the next moves, I can choose a safe path.\n\nBut to maximize score, since I can't reach the other food, eating this one is good.\n\nPerhaps at turn 38, move D to (6,3), then turn 39 move L to (5,3), turn 40 move U to (5,4) eat, then turn 41 move L to (4,4), turn 42 move D to (4,3), etc.\n\nBut similar.\n\nI think I'll go with eating at turn 38.\n\nSo action turn 38: L\n\nThen for turn 39, from (5,4) move L to (4,4)\n\nTurn 40, from (4,4) move D to (4,3) (since U occupied)\n\nTurn 41, from (4,3) move L to (3,3) or D to (4,2), say move L to (3,3)\n\nTurn 42, from (3,3) move D to (3,2) or U to (3,4), say move D to (3,2)\n\nBut I need to output the actions.\n\nThe answer should be in the box.\n\nAlso, the head direction changes.\n\nFor turn 38: move L, so new direction L.\n\nTurn 39: move L, direction L.\n\nTurn 40: move D, direction D.\n\nTurn 41: move L, but from (4,3), moving L to (3,3) is left, so direction L.\n\nBut previous direction at turn 40 was D, so moving L is not reverse, ok.\n\nTurn 42: move D to (3,2), direction D.\n\nBut let's see if safe.\n\nAt turn 41, from (4,3) move L to (3,3), then at (3,3), U: (3,4) free, D: (3,2) free, L: (2,3) occupied, R: (4,3) occupied, so U or D.\n\nMove D to (3,2) is safe.\n\nSimilarly, all moves are safe for now.\n\nSo for the answer, I can do:\n\nTurn 38: L\n\nTurn 39: L\n\nTurn 40: D\n\nTurn 41: L\n\nTurn 42: D\n\nBut at turn 41, from (4,3), moving L to (3,3) is possible, yes.\n\nTo make it longer, but 5 turns is minimum.\n\nThe state is turn 38, so actions for 38,39,40,41,42.\n\nI think this is fine.\n</think>\nTo maximize the score while ensuring long-term survival, the AI must prioritize eating the positive food at (5,4) immediately, as it has a limited life span (6 turns, disappearing after turn 43). Delaying consumption risks losing this +1 score opportunity. However, the snake must avoid the body and walls, and plan multiple turns ahead to prevent dead ends or collisions, especially given the snake's length (15 segments) and the confined grid with obstacles.\n\nAfter eating the food at (5,4) on turn 38, the snake grows to 16 segments. The subsequent moves focus on navigating toward the left side of the grid to eventually access the other positive food at (1,3) (life span 9 turns, disappearing after turn 46), but this must be done cautiously to avoid collisions. The chosen path moves left and down to create space and avoid immediate risks, with a 5-turn plan as follows:\n\n- **Turn 38 (current turn)**: Move left (L) to (5,4) to eat the positive food (+1 score, length increases to 16). This is safe as (5,4) is adjacent and not under the tail, so no tail reward danger. Head direction was down (D), moving left is valid (no instant reverse issue).\n\n- **Turn 39**: From (5,4), move left (L) to (4,4). This avoids moving up (to occupied (5,5)) or down (to (5,3), which is safe but less strategic for long-term pathing). Moving left begins navigation toward the left side for potential access to (1,3). New head direction is left (L).\n\n- **Turn 40**: From (4,4), move down (D) to (4,3). Moving up is blocked by body at (4,5), and moving left to (3,4) is possible but moving down creates space and avoids potential traps. New head direction is down (D).\n\n- **Turn 41**: From (4,3), move left (L) to (3,3). Moving down to (4,2) is safe but moving left progresses toward the left side. Moving right to (5,3) is also safe but less optimal for reaching (1,3). New head direction is left (L).\n\n- **Turn 42**: From (3,3), move down (D) to (3,2). Moving up to (3,4) is safe, but moving down avoids the body at (2,3) and (3,1) and opens options for future moves. New head direction is down (D).\n\nThis 5-turn plan ensures the snake eats the high-priority food at (5,4) immediately, then maneuvers safely with no collision risks. Beyond turn 42, the snake can continue toward (1,3) by moving to (3,2), then (3,1) if freed, or (4,2), but this requires monitoring body positions and food life spans. Given the grid constraints, reaching (1,3) may not be feasible within its life span, so survival and scoring the immediate food are prioritized.\n\n**Actions for turns 38 to 42:**\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 38: L (left)  \nTurn 39: L (left)  \nTurn 40: D (down)  \nTurn 41: L (left)  \nTurn 42: D (down)\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to understand the current state. It's turn 40, and I'm the AI controlling the snake. The grid has walls: border cells at x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7, and one internal obstacle at (5,6). So, the grid is 8x8, from (0,0) to (7,7), but walls are at the borders and (5,6), meaning I can't move into those cells.\n\nSnake positions: head is at (5,3), and the body segments follow: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1). That's 15 segments, so the snake is quite long.\n\nHead direction is left (L), meaning it was moving left last turn. Since I can't instantly reverse, I can't move right on this turn. So possible moves are up (U), down (D), or continue left (L), but not right (R).\n\nNow, food positions:\n\n- (5,4) with value 1 and life span 4. That means it disappears after 4 turns, including this turn. So it has 4 turns left, but since it decreases every turn, after this turn, it will have 3 left, then 2, then 1, then gone.\n\nLife span: disappears after N turns, and countdown decreases every turn including current. So for this food, at turn 40, life span 4 means it will be there for turns 40,41,42,43, and gone at turn 44.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) with value 1 and life span 7. So present from turn 40 to 46.\n\n(3,4) with value 1 and life span 10. Present from turn 40 to 49.\n\nAll food has value 1, so all are positive food. No negative food mentioned.\n\nNow, I need to think 5+ turns ahead, prioritize long-term survival over immediate rewards.\n\nFirst, let's map the grid. I'll sketch a small grid to visualize.\n\nGrid size: x from 0 to 7, y from 0 to 7.\n\nWalls: x=0, x=7, y=0, y=7 are walls. Also internal obstacle at (5,6).\n\nSo cells like (0,0) to (0,7), (7,0) to (7,7), (0,0) to (7,0), (0,7) to (7,7) are walls. And (5,6) is blocked.\n\nSnake positions:\n\nHead: (5,3)\n\nBody: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)\n\nNow, food at:\n\n- (5,4) - which is directly above the head? Head is at (5,3), so (5,4) is one cell up.\n\n(5,4) is north of (5,3).\n\nAlso, (1,3) and (3,4).\n\n(1,3) is left, but x=1, y=3.\n\n(3,4) is left and up from head.\n\nHead is at (5,3), so:\n\n- (5,4) is adjacent up.\n\n- (3,4) is two left and one up? x from 5 to 3 is left two, y from 3 to 4 is up one.\n\n- (1,3) is four left, same y.\n\nBut snake is long, so I need to consider paths.\n\nAlso, tail is at (5,1), which is south of head? Head (5,3), tail (5,1) is two down, but there are body segments in between.\n\nList all occupied cells by snake:\n\nFrom positions:\n\n(5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)\n\nSo, let's plot:\n\nRow y=5: (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5)\n\ny=4: (6,4), (2,4)\n\ny=3: (5,3), (6,3), (2,3)  head at (5,3), and (6,3) and (2,3)\n\n(6,3) is body, (2,3) is body.\n\ny=2: (2,2)\n\ny=1: (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)\n\nNow, food at (5,4), (1,3), (3,4)\n\n(5,4) is not occupied by snake? Let's see: snake has (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), etc. (5,4) is not in the list. Positions are (5,3), then (6,3), so (5,4) is free? But it might be under body or something.\n\nSnake positions: head (5,3), then next is (6,3), which is east, then (6,4) north, then (6,5) north, then (5,5) west, etc. So (5,4) is not occupied; it's empty.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) and (1,3) are empty.\n\nBut (5,4) has food, and it's adjacent to head. Head at (5,3), so moving up to (5,4) would eat the food, since it's positive food.\n\nBut I need to check the tail reward danger.\n\nTail reward danger: if head is adjacent to the tail and the tail cell has positive food, eating it kills because head and new tail collide.\n\nFirst, where is the tail? Tail is at (5,1). Head is at (5,3), so not adjacent; (5,3) and (5,1) are two apart vertically, with (5,2) free? Snake has (2,1) to (5,1), but y=1: (2,1),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1), and y=2: (2,2), y=3: (5,3),(6,3),(2,3), so (5,2) is not occupied, I think.\n\nCells: for example, (5,2) not listed, so free.\n\nSimilarly, head (5,3) to tail (5,1) not adjacent; they are separated.\n\nAdjacent cells to head: (5,3) has neighbors: up (5,4), down (5,2), left (4,3), right (6,3) but (6,3) is occupied by body, so cannot move there.\n\nCurrent head position: (5,3)\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Up (U) to (5,4): is this cell free? (5,4) has food, but is it occupied? Snake positions don't include (5,4), so it's free. And it has food.\n\n- Down (D) to (5,2): (5,2) not in snake positions, and not wall, so should be free.\n\n- Left (L) to (4,3): (4,3) not in positions? Positions: (5,3), (6,3), etc. (4,3) not listed, so free? But let's see: snake has (4,5), (3,5), etc., but not (4,3). Also, walls not there, so free.\n\n- Right (R) to (6,3): but (6,3) is the second segment, occupied, so cannot move right. Also, head direction is left, so moving right is reverse, which is not allowed instantly. But since (6,3) is occupied, definitely cannot move there.\n\nSo possible moves: U, D, L.\n\nNow, moving U to (5,4) would eat the food at (5,4), since head moves onto it. Food is there, value +1, snake length increases by 1.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nAlso, life span: (5,4) has life span 4, meaning it disappears after turn 43, so if I don't eat it now, it might be available for a few turns.\n\nSimilarly, other food.\n\nBut since it's adjacent, I could eat it now.\n\nBut let's consider the consequences.\n\nIf I eat (5,4), snake grows, so after move, head to (5,4), and tail doesn't move off because we ate, so new segment added, so positions become: new head (5,4), then previous head (5,3) now second, then (6,3), (6,4), etc., and tail still at (5,1), but since we ate, tail doesn't move, so snake length 16 now.\n\nBut after eating, the tail stays, so positions: head (5,4), then (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) — that's 16 positions, yes.\n\nNow, is there any immediate danger? For example, after moving to (5,4), what are possible next moves.\n\nHead at (5,4), direction from (5,3) to (5,4) is up, so last direction U.\n\nPossible moves from (5,4):\n\n- Up (U) to (5,5): but (5,5) is occupied by body; positions show (5,5) is part of body. Currently, before move, (5,5) is occupied, and after move, if head to (5,4), (5,5) is still occupied by the segment that was there, which is now the third segment or something.\n\nAfter move: segments: [ (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), ... ] so (5,5) is the sixth segment, but still occupied. So moving up to (5,5) would collide with body.\n\n- Down (D) to (5,3): but (5,3) is now the second segment, occupied, so collision.\n\n- Left (L) to (4,4): is (4,4) free? Not in positions, and not wall, so probably free.\n\n- Right (R) to (6,4): (6,4) is in positions, currently before move it's occupied, after move it would be the fourth segment or so. Positions: after move, head (5,4), then (5,3), then (6,3), then (6,4), so (6,4) is the fourth segment, occupied. So cannot move right.\n\nSo from (5,4), only possible move is left to (4,4), if I move U now.\n\nIf I move U to (5,4), then next turn I can only move L to (4,4), no other choice.\n\nThen from (4,4), where can I go?\n\nBut let's not get ahead; I need to think multiple turns.\n\nFirst, moving U now might be risky because after that, I'm forced to move L, and then what.\n\n(4,4) is free now, but after moving there, head at (4,4), last direction L (since from (5,4) to (4,4) is left).\n\nThen from (4,4), possible moves:\n\n- Up to (4,5): (4,5) is occupied; in current positions, (4,5) is body, and after previous moves, it would still be occupied. If I moved U to (5,4) then L to (4,4), now at turn 42, head (4,4).\n\nSegments: after turn 40 move U: head (5,4), body (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), etc.\n\nThen turn 41 move L to (4,4): so head to (4,4), then body: (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), ... (4,5) is now the seventh segment, still occupied.\n\nSo from (4,4), move U to (4,5): occupied, collision.\n\nDown to (4,3): (4,3) not occupied, should be free.\n\nLeft to (3,4): (3,4) has food, but is it free? Not occupied by snake, so yes.\n\nRight to (5,4): but (5,4) is now the second segment, occupied, collision.\n\nSo possible moves from (4,4): D to (4,3) or L to (3,4).\n\nIf I go to (3,4), I eat the food there, since (3,4) has food.\n\nBut let's see the big picture.\n\nI have other options now at turn 40.\n\nInstead of U, I could move D or L.\n\nMove D to (5,2): (5,2) is free, no food.\n\nThen head at (5,2), last direction D.\n\nPossible moves from (5,2):\n\n- Down to (5,1): but (5,1) is tail, but when I move, the tail moves, so if I move to (5,2), the tail at (5,1) moves off, so (5,1) becomes free after the move, but when I move to (5,2), the head moves to (5,2), and the tail moves from (5,1) to wherever, but in this case, since I didn't eat, tail moves.\n\nGeneral movement: if not eating, head moves to new cell, each segment moves to the next position, tail leaves its cell.\n\nIf eating, head moves to food cell, new segment added, tail stays.\n\nHere, moving to (5,2) no food, so no eat, tail moves.\n\nSo after move D to (5,2): head at (5,2), then body: (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), etc., down to (5,1) moves off, so tail is now (4,1) or something.\n\nPositions: before move, tail is (5,1), but after move, head to (5,2), then previous head (5,3) becomes second, (6,3) third, ..., and the last segment (5,1) is removed, so tail is now (4,1), I think.\n\nList: current positions: index 0: (5,3), 1: (6,3), 2: (6,4), 3: (6,5), 4: (5,5), 5: (4,5), 6: (3,5), 7: (2,5), 8: (2,4), 9: (2,3), 10: (2,2), 11: (2,1), 12: (3,1), 13: (4,1), 14: (5,1)\n\nAfter move D to (5,2): head to (5,2), then body: (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) — and (5,1) is gone, so tail at (4,1), length 14 now? No, 15 segments, removed one, so 14 segments.\n\nOriginal 15 segments, move without eating, so head moves to new cell, all segments shift, tail cell vacated, so snake has 14 segments now.\n\nBut positions: head (5,2), then 1: (5,3), 2: (6,3), 3: (6,4), 4: (6,5), 5: (5,5), 6: (4,5), 7: (3,5), 8: (2,5), 9: (2,4), 10: (2,3), 11: (2,2), 12: (2,1), 13: (3,1), 14: (4,1) — so 15 positions? Head (5,2), plus 14 from previous, but previous had 14 bodies? Let's count: original 15 positions, after move, we add head to (5,2), and remove tail (5,1), so positions: (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) — that's 15 segments still? No: when we move, the snake moves one cell, so the new head is at (5,2), and the tail is removed, so the body segments are from index 1 to 14 of original, but shifted.\n\nStandard: the segment that was at index i moves to index i+1, except head new position.\n\nSo: new head: (5,2)\n\nThen segment 0 (old head) becomes body at index 1: (5,3)\n\nSegment 1 becomes index 2: (6,3)\n\n...\nUp to segment 13: (4,1) becomes index 14\n\nSegment 14: (5,1) is removed.\n\nSo positions: (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) — 15 positions? (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) — that's 15 cells, but (4,1) is the last, and (5,1) is gone, so tail at (4,1), and length is 15, same as before? No, when not eating, the length remains the same, but the snake moves forward, so tail is removed, head new cell, so number of segments same, but position changed.\n\nIn this case, from 15 segments, after move without eating, still 15 segments, but tail moved.\n\nHere, tail was (5,1), now tail is (4,1), and (5,1) is free.\n\nBack to moves.\n\nIf I move D to (5,2) at turn 40, head at (5,2), last direction D.\n\nThen from (5,2), possible moves:\n\n- Down to (5,1): but (5,1) is now free, since tail moved, but (5,1) was tail, now after move, it's free. But (5,1) has no food, so I can move there, but it's south.\n\n(5,1) is at y=1, which is above wall y=0, but y=0 is wall, so (5,1) is not wall, it's valid.\n\nMoving to (5,1): no food, so tail moves again.\n\nBut then I'm near the bottom.\n\n- Up to (5,3): but (5,3) is now the second segment, occupied, cannot move there.\n\n- Left to (4,2): (4,2) not occupied, free.\n\n- Right to (6,2): (6,2) not occupied, free? Walls: x=0 and x=7 walls, so (6,2) should be free.\n\nBut (6,2) is not wall, not in snake positions, so free.\n\nSo from (5,2), I can move D, L, or R.\n\nSimilarly, move L at turn 40 to (4,3).\n\n(4,3) is free, no food there.\n\nHead to (4,3), last direction L.\n\nThen possible moves from (4,3):\n\n- Up to (4,4): free\n\n- Down to (4,2): free\n\n- Left to (3,3): free? (3,3) not occupied\n\n- Right to (5,3): occupied, cannot\n\nSo I can go U, D, L.\n\nNow, back to the food.\n\nFood at (5,4) is close, but if I eat it, I'm forced to move left immediately after, and I might eat (3,4) food soon after.\n\nBut let's think about the grid and available space.\n\nThe snake is coiled around, especially on the left side.\n\nFor example, from x=2 to x=6, y from 1 to 5, many cells occupied.\n\nFree cells: for instance, (1,1) to (1,7) but walls, y=0 and y=7 walls, so y from 1 to 6.\n\nx from 1 to 6, but internal walls.\n\nList all free cells.\n\nGrid cells: x from 1 to 6 (since x=0 and x=7 walls), y from 1 to 6 (y=0 and y=7 walls), except internal obstacle (5,6).\n\nBut (5,6) is wall, so not accessible.\n\nAlso, snake occupies: (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)\n\nFood at (5,4), (1,3), (3,4)\n\nFree cells: for example, (1,1) but x=1,y=1: not wall, not snake? Snake has (2,1), (3,1), etc., but (1,1) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2), (1,3) has food, (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) but y=6, not wall? y=0 and y=7 walls, so y=6 is valid.\n\nBut (5,6) is wall, so (1,6) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) has food, (3,6) but (5,6) wall, (3,6) free.\n\n(4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,6)\n\n(5,2), (5,4) has food, but (5,4) is food, not free for movement unless eating.\n\n(6,2), (6,6) but (5,6) wall, (6,6) free? y=6, x=6.\n\n(7,2) to (7,6) but x=7 wall, so invalid.\n\nAlso (3,1) to (5,1) occupied, but (1,1) free.\n\nNow, the area near (1,3) might be accessible.\n\nBut the snake is long, and the head is at (5,3), with body around.\n\nIf I move left to (4,3), I can then go to (3,3) or (4,4), etc.\n\nBut let's think about the food life span.\n\nFood at (5,4) has life span 4, so if not eaten by turn 43, it disappears.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) life span 7, until turn 46.\n\n(3,4) life span 10, until turn 49.\n\nTurn 40 now, so (5,4) has few turns left.\n\nIf I don't eat it now, I might not get another chance, or it might be risky.\n\nBut eating it now forces me into a corner.\n\nAfter eating (5,4), I must move left to (4,4), then from there, I can move down to (4,3) or left to (3,4).\n\nIf I move to (3,4), I eat that food too, since (3,4) has food.\n\nThen snake grows more.\n\nBut let's see the space.\n\nAfter eating both, snake is longer, and I'm near the top-left area.\n\nFrom (3,4), I could move to other places.\n\nBut there might be a risk of trapping myself.\n\nFor example, after moving to (3,4), head at (3,4), last direction from (4,4) to (3,4) is left.\n\nThen possible moves:\n\n- Up to (3,5): but (3,5) is occupied; in current positions, (3,5) is body, and after previous moves, it would be occupied.\n\nAfter eating (5,4) and then (3,4), let's simulate.\n\nTurn 40: move U to (5,4), eat food, snake grows to 16 segments.\n\nPositions: head (5,4), then (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)\n\nTurn 41: only possible move L to (4,4), no eat, so move to (4,4), tail moves off (5,1), so new positions: head (4,4), then (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) — tail at (4,1)\n\nLength 16.\n\nNow at (4,4), I can move to (3,4) to eat the food there.\n\n(3,4) has food, so move L to (3,4), eat food, grow to 17.\n\nHead to (3,4), then body: (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), etc., tail stays, so positions: head (3,4), then (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) — 17 segments.\n\nNow at (3,4), last direction L.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Up to (3,5): (3,5) is occupied; it's the tenth segment or so, still body.\n\n- Down to (3,3): free? (3,3) not occupied.\n\n- Left to (2,4): (2,4) is occupied; in positions, (2,4) is body.\n\n- Right to (4,4): but (4,4) is second segment, occupied.\n\nSo only possible move is down to (3,3).\n\nThen from (3,3), I can go to (3,2) or (2,3) or (4,3), etc.\n\nBut (2,3) is occupied, so from (3,3), moves: U to (3,4) occupied, D to (3,2) free, L to (2,3) occupied, R to (4,3) free.\n\nSo to (3,2) or (4,3).\n\nIf I go to (3,2), then to (3,1) but (3,1) is body, or to (2,2) or (4,2).\n\nThis might be getting tight with a long snake.\n\nMoreover, the food at (1,3) is available, but I'm far.\n\nIf I don't eat (5,4) now, I could go for other food.\n\nFor example, move L to (4,3) at turn 40.\n\nThen head at (4,3), last direction L.\n\nThen I can move U to (4,4), which is free, or D to (4,2), free, or L to (3,3), free.\n\nIf I move U to (4,4), then I can move to (3,4) to eat the food at (3,4), since it's there.\n\n(3,4) has food.\n\nSo at turn 40 move L to (4,3)\n\nTurn 41 move U to (4,4)\n\nThen at (4,4), I can move L to (3,4) to eat food.\n\nThen similar to before.\n\nBut I avoided eating (5,4) first.\n\nAfter eating (3,4), I can go to (3,3) or other places.\n\nBut still, the area is crowded.\n\nPerhaps I should go down to open space.\n\nFor example, at turn 40, move D to (5,2).\n\nThen head at (5,2), last direction D.\n\nThen I can move to (5,1), or (4,2), or (6,2).\n\n(5,1) is now free, as we saw earlier.\n\nMove to (5,1): no food, so tail moves.\n\nThen from there, I can go left or right, but (4,1) or (6,1), but (6,1) might be free.\n\nBut y=1 is near wall.\n\nNot much space.\n\nMove to (4,2) or (6,2) instead.\n\nLet's think about the tail reward danger.\n\nFor example, if the head is adjacent to the tail and the tail has food, eating it kills.\n\nBut here, tail is at (5,1), head at (5,3), not adjacent. After moves, it might be different.\n\nBut for now, no issue.\n\nPrioritize long-term survival.\n\nThe grid has limited space, and the snake is long, 15 segments.\n\nTotal cells: 8x8 = 64, minus walls: borders are walls, so playable area is x1 to x6, y1 to y6, 6x6=36 cells, minus internal wall (5,6), so 35 cells.\n\nSnake occupies 15, so 20 free cells, including food positions.\n\nBut some free cells are isolated.\n\nFor example, the left side has some free cells like (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) food, (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)\n\nAlso (3,3), (3,4) food, (3,6)\n\n(4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,6)\n\n(5,2), (5,4) food\n\n(6,2), (6,6)\n\n etc.\n\nBut (5,4) is food, so if not eaten, it's occupied by food until gone.\n\nFood cells can be moved onto to eat.\n\nTo maximize score, I should eat food, but avoid risks.\n\nEating (5,4) now might not be best because it forces me into a position where I have few choices next.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) is also in a somewhat crowded area.\n\n(1,3) is in the corner with more space.\n\nBut to reach (1,3), I need to go left.\n\nFor example, at turn 40, move L to (4,3).\n\nThen from (4,3), I can move L to (3,3), then to (3,4) or (2,3) but (2,3) occupied, so to (3,4) to eat or to (3,2).\n\nIf I move to (3,3), then to (3,4) to eat.\n\nBut let's plan a path to (1,3).\n\nFrom head (5,3), move L to (4,3)\n\nThen from (4,3), move L to (3,3)\n\nThen from (3,3), I can move L to (2,3) but (2,3) occupied, so cannot.\n\n(2,3) is body, so blocked.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can move D to (3,2), which is free.\n\n(3,2) not occupied.\n\nThen from (3,2), I can move L to (2,2) but (2,2) occupied, or D to (3,1) occupied, or R to (4,2), or U to (3,3) occupied.\n\nSo only to (4,2) or to (3,1) but (3,1) occupied, so only to (4,2).\n\nThen from (4,2), etc.\n\nNot direct to (1,3).\n\nTo reach (1,3), I need to go around.\n\nFor example, from (5,3), move D to (5,2), then L to (4,2), then L to (3,2), then U to (3,3), then L to (2,3) but (2,3) occupied, still blocked.\n\nThe body is blocking the left side.\n\nCurrent snake: from (2,1) to (2,5) and down to (5,1), so the column x=2 is mostly occupied from y=1 to y=5, except (2,6) but y=6, (2,6) free.\n\ny=6 is playable.\n\nFor example, (2,6) is free.\n\nSimilarly, (1,6), etc.\n\nSo to reach (1,3), I might need to go up to y=6 then left.\n\nFor instance, from head (5,3), move U to (5,4) but if I do that, I eat food and am forced left.\n\nMove L to (4,3), then U to (4,4), then U to (4,5) but (4,5) occupied, cannot.\n\nFrom (4,4), I can move to (4,5) occupied, or to (3,4) or (4,3).\n\nOnly to (3,4).\n\nThen from (3,4), to (3,3) or (3,5) occupied.\n\nTo (3,3).\n\nThen from (3,3), to (3,2) or (4,3).\n\nThen to (3,2), then to (3,1) occupied or (4,2) or (2,2) occupied.\n\nTo (4,2).\n\nThen from (4,2), to (4,1) occupied or (4,3) or (5,2) or (3,2).\n\n etc.\n\nTo go up, from (4,4), I can only go to (3,4) or down, not up because (4,5) occupied.\n\nUnless the body moves.\n\nBut the body moves when I move.\n\nFor example, if I move away, some cells become free.\n\nAt turn 40, if I move D to (5,2), then the tail moves, (5,1) free, and the body shifts.\n\nHead to (5,2), body (5,3), (6,3), etc., tail (4,1).\n\nNow, (2,3) is still occupied, but if I continue moving, it might free up.\n\nBut to reach (1,3), I can move from (5,2) to (4,2), then to (3,2), then to (3,1) but (3,1) occupied, or to (3,3), or to (2,2) occupied.\n\n(2,2) is body, occupied.\n\nMove to (3,3), then from there to (3,4) if possible.\n\nBut (3,4) has food, I can eat it.\n\nThen from (3,4) to (3,3) or (3,5) occupied, so to (3,3), etc.\n\nStill not to (1,3).\n\nPerhaps I need to go to the top row.\n\nFor example, from head (5,3), move U to (5,4) but then forced left.\n\nAfter moving left to (4,4), I can only go down or left to (3,4).\n\nThen from (3,4) to (3,3), then to (3,2), then to (3,1) occupied or (4,2).\n\nFrom (3,2), I can go to (2,2) but (2,2) occupied, or to (4,2), or to (3,1) occupied, so only (4,2).\n\nThen from (4,2), to (4,1) occupied or (4,3) or (5,2) or (3,2).\n\nIf I go to (4,3), etc.\n\nTo reach the left, I can go to (1,6) or something.\n\nBut (1,3) is at y=3, x=1.\n\nThe cell (2,3) is occupied, so I cannot move directly to (1,3) from (2,3) because it's occupied.\n\nI need to approach from above or below when it's free.\n\nFor example, if I move the snake, the body at (2,3) will eventually move when the snake moves.\n\nSuppose at turn 40, I move D to (5,2).\n\nThen positions: head (5,2), body (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) tail at (4,1)\n\nNow, (2,3) is still occupied, at index 10.\n\nIf I move L to (4,2), for example.\n\nTurn 41: move from (5,2) to (4,2), no food, so head to (4,2), body: (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), etc., tail (3,1) or something.\n\nPositions: head (4,2), then (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1) — tail at (3,1)\n\nNow (2,3) is still occupied.\n\nThen from (4,2), I can move to (3,2) or (4,3) or (4,1) but (4,1) occupied or (5,2) occupied.\n\nMove to (3,2): (3,2) free, no food.\n\nHead to (3,2), last direction L.\n\nThen from (3,2), move to (3,1) but (3,1) occupied, or (3,3) free, or (2,2) occupied, or (4,2) occupied.\n\nSo only to (3,3).\n\nHead to (3,3), then body: (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), etc., tail moves off (3,1), so new tail at (2,1).\n\nPositions: head (3,3), then (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1) — tail at (2,1)\n\nNow (2,3) is still occupied, at index 13.\n\nBut (3,4) is free and has food.\n\nFrom (3,3), I can move U to (3,4) to eat food.\n\nThen head to (3,4), eat, grow to 16 segments.\n\nThen positions: head (3,4), then (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1) — 17 positions? 16 after growth.\n\nAfter eating, tail doesn't move, so segments: head (3,4), then (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), and (2,1) tail, so 17 segments.\n\nNow at (3,4), last direction U.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- Up to (3,5): (3,5) occupied, body\n\n- Down to (3,3): occupied, second segment\n\n- Left to (2,4): (2,4) occupied, body\n\n- Right to (4,4): free? (4,4) not occupied, free.\n\nSo only move right to (4,4).\n\nThen from (4,4), I can move to (4,3), (4,5), or (3,4) occupied, or (5,4) if free.\n\n(4,5) occupied, (3,4) occupied, (5,4) may have food, but life span.\n\n(5,4) food is still there, but after turn 40, if not eaten, life span decreases.\n\nIn this scenario, I moved D at turn 40, so (5,4) not eaten, at turn 41, life span 3, etc.\n\nBut in this path, at turn 42, I'm at (4,4), and (5,4) is free with food if not eaten.\n\nFrom (4,4), I can move R to (5,4) to eat, or D to (4,3), or U to (4,5) occupied, L to (3,4) occupied.\n\nSo to (5,4) or (4,3).\n\nIf I move to (5,4), eat food, grow more.\n\nBut then I might be trapped.\n\nFor example, after eating (5,4), head at (5,4), last direction R.\n\nThen possible moves:\n\n- Up to (5,5): occupied\n\n- Down to (5,3): occupied\n\n- Left to (4,4): occupied, second segment\n\n- Right to (6,4): occupied\n\nAll directions blocked? (5,5) occupied, (5,3) occupied, (4,4) occupied, (6,4) occupied.\n\nIn positions, after moving to (5,4), head (5,4), then (4,4), (3,4), (3,3), etc., so (4,4) is second, occupied; (5,3) is fifth or something, but (5,3) is occupied; (5,5) occupied; (6,4) occupied.\n\nSo no possible move, snake dies.\n\nThat's bad.\n\nIn this sequence, if I go to (5,4) after being at (4,4), it's suicide.\n\nSo I should not do that.\n\nFrom (4,4), I should move D to (4,3) instead.\n\nThen to (4,2) or (3,3), etc.\n\nBut the snake is long, and space is limited.\n\nTo avoid this, perhaps at the beginning, I should not eat (5,4) immediately if it leads to dead ends.\n\nSimilarly, for the first option, if I eat (5,4) at turn 40, then move to (4,4) at turn 41, then to (3,4) at turn 42 to eat, then to (3,3) at turn 43, then to (3,2) or (4,3), etc., which might be safer than the above dead end.\n\nIn the first path: after eating (3,4) at turn 42, head at (3,4), then only move to (3,3), then from (3,3) to (3,2) or (4,3).\n\nSay move to (3,2), then to (4,2) or (3,1) occupied, so to (4,2), then to (4,1) occupied or (4,3) or (5,2) or (3,2) occupied.\n\nTo (4,3) or (5,2).\n\nThen from (4,3), to (4,4) or (4,2) or (3,3) or (5,3) occupied, etc.\n\nIt might be possible to man the snake out.\n\nBut with 17 segments, and only 35-17=18 free cells, but some are food or will be free.\n\nBut it's tight.\n\nPerhaps I should go for the food with longer life span and more space.\n\n(1,3) has life span 7, so I have time, and it's in the left corner with more free cells around.\n\nTo reach it, I need to free the left side.\n\nFor example, if I move down or right to allow the body to move.\n\nAt turn 40, move R is not possible because of body and reverse.\n\nOnly U, D, L.\n\nMove D to (5,2).\n\nThen at turn 41, move L to (4,2).\n\nThen at turn 42, move L to (3,2).\n\nThen at turn 43, move U to (3,3).\n\nThen at turn 44, move U to (3,4) to eat food if still there.\n\n(3,4) life span 10, so at turn 44, it has life span 10 - (44-40) = 10-4=6 turns left, so available.\n\nThen after eating, I can go to (3,5) but occupied, or to (4,4) or (2,4) occupied, so to (4,4).\n\nThen from (4,4) to (4,3) or (4,5) occupied, to (4,3).\n\n etc.\n\nBut still not to (1,3).\n\nTo reach (1,3), I need to go to (1,2) or (1,4) or (2,3) when free.\n\n(2,3) is occupied, but as the snake moves, it will become free eventually.\n\nFor example, if I keep moving, the tail will move, and the body will shift.\n\nSuppose I move down and left to free the left column.\n\nAt turn 40, move D to (5,2).\n\nTurn 41, move L to (4,2).\n\nTurn 42, move D to (4,1) but (4,1) is tail or body? At turn 42, positions depend.\n\nAfter turn 40 move D to (5,2): head (5,2), body (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1)\n\nTurn 41 move L to (4,2): head (4,2), body (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1) tail at (3,1)\n\nTurn 42, move from (4,2) to where? Possible moves: U to (4,3), D to (4,1) but (4,1) occupied? (4,1) is not in positions, but (3,1) is tail, (4,1) is free? Positions: head (4,2), body (5,2), (5,3), ..., (3,1), so (4,1) is free.\n\n(4,1) not occupied, so I can move D to (4,1), no food.\n\nThen head to (4,1), last direction D.\n\nThen body: (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), etc., tail moves off (3,1), so new tail at (2,1).\n\nPositions: head (4,1), then (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1) tail at (2,1)\n\nNow (2,3) is still occupied, but at index 12.\n\nIf I move L to (3,1), but (3,1) is not occupied now? Positions have (2,1) tail, (3,1) not listed, so free? From above, positions: head (4,1), body (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1)\n\nSo (3,1) is free.\n\nMove L from (4,1) to (3,1), no food.\n\nHead to (3,1), last direction L.\n\nThen body: (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), etc., tail moves off (2,1), so new tail at (2,2) or something.\n\nPositions: head (3,1), then (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2) tail at (2,2)\n\nNow (2,3) is occupied, at index 13.\n\nBut (2,4) is also occupied.\n\nTo free (2,3), I need to move the snake further.\n\nFor example, move U to (3,2) from (3,1), but (3,2) free? Not occupied, yes.\n\nHead to (3,2), then body: (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), etc., tail moves off (2,2), so positions: head (3,2), then (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) tail at (2,3)\n\nNow (2,3) is tail, so if I move to (2,3), I can, but no food, so it moves.\n\nBut to reach (1,3), from (3,2), I can move L to (2,2) but (2,2) occupied, or U to (3,3), or D to (3,1) occupied, or R to (4,2) occupied.\n\nSo only to (3,3).\n\nThen from (3,3) to (3,4) etc.\n\nStill not to (1,3).\n\nIt will take many turns to free the left side.\n\nPerhaps it's not efficient, and I might miss the food at (5,4) which has short life.\n\nSo for short-term gain, eating (5,4) now might be better, and then I can eat (3,4) soon after.\n\nAnd with careful movement, I can survive.\n\nFor example, at turn 40 move U to (5,4) eat food.\n\nTurn 41 move L to (4,4) no eat.\n\nTurn 42 move L to (3,4) eat food.\n\nTurn 43 move D to (3,3) no eat.\n\nTurn 44 move D to (3,2) no eat.\n\nTurn 45 move R to (4,2) or something.\n\nFrom (3,2), move to (4,2), then to (4,3), then to (4,4) occupied, so to (5,3) or (3,3) occupied, or (4,1) if free.\n\n(4,1) may be free.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nAlso, the food at (1,3) is there for 7 turns, so I can go for it later.\n\nSimilarly, after eating the two foods, I have more length, but also more score.\n\nSince all food is +1, eating sooner is better for score, but with risk.\n\nBut in this case, eating (5,4) and then (3,4) seems possible without immediate death.\n\nIn the turn 43 at (3,3), I can move D to (3,2), then to (4,2), etc., as above.\n\nOr from (3,3), I can move R to (4,3), then to (4,2) or (4,4) occupied, so to (4,2) or (5,3).\n\n(5,3) is occupied after previous moves.\n\nAfter turn 42 at (3,4), move to (3,3) at turn 43.\n\nPositions at turn 42 after eating (3,4): head (3,4), body (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) — 17 segments.\n\nTurn 43 move D to (3,3): no eat, so head to (3,3), body: (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (3,1) tail at (3,1)\n\nLength 17.\n\nAt (3,3), move to (3,2) or (4,3) or (2,3) occupied, or (3,4) occupied.\n\nSo to (3,2) or (4,3).\n\nSay move to (3,2) at turn 44.\n\nHead to (3,2), body: (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), etc., tail moves off (3,1), so new tail at (2,1).\n\nPositions: head (3,2), then (3,3), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1) tail at (2,1)\n\nNow from (3,2), move to (4,2) or (3,1) but (3,1) free? Not occupied, yes.\n\nOr (2,2) occupied.\n\nSo to (4,2) or (3,1).\n\nIf move to (4,2), then to (4,1) or (4,3) or (5,2) or (3,2) occupied.\n\n(4,1) may be free, (4,3) free, etc.\n\nI can navigate to the bottom or right.\n\nSo it seems survivable.\n\nIf I don't eat (5,4), it might disappear, and I lose the opportunity.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) has longer life.\n\nBut since (5,4) is close and short-lived, I should eat it.\n\nThen for the answer, I need to output actions for multiple turns, but the format says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\" but output the actions for the current turn and future turns as per the state.\n\nThe answer format is to output from turn t1 to some turns, but it doesn't specify how many, but since it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", I should output at least 5 turns of actions.\n\nThe boxed answer should have Turn 40: action, Turn 41: action, etc.\n\nBut I need to decide the actions.\n\nPerhaps for turn 40, move U to eat (5,4).\n\nThen turn 41 move L to (4,4)\n\nTurn 42 move L to (3,4) to eat that food.\n\nThen turn 43 move D to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 44 move D to (3,2)\n\nThen turn 45 move to (4,2) or (3,1), say to (4,2) for example.\n\nBut I need to specify.\n\nSince the food at (1,3) is available, after turn 44 or so, I can head towards it.\n\nBut let's see the actions.\n\nFirst, at turn 40, move U.\n\nThen turn 41, only choice is L to (4,4)\n\nTurn 42, from (4,4), I can move L to (3,4) to eat, or D to (4,3)\n\nIf I move D to (4,3), I avoid eating for now, but (3,4) food is there, and I can eat it later.\n\nBut moving to (4,3) might give more flexibility.\n\nFor example, from (4,4), move D to (4,3), then from (4,3), I can move to (4,2), (3,3), (4,4) occupied, (5,3) occupied.\n\nTo (4,2) or (3,3).\n\nThen to (3,3), then to (3,4) to eat.\n\nBut similar.\n\nBut eating (3,4) at turn 42 or 43 is fine.\n\nTo maximize, eating soon is good.\n\nI think moving U at turn 40 is reasonable.\n\nThen for the actions:\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: L (only choice)\n\nTurn 42: L to (3,4) to eat food\n\nThen from there, as above.\n\nBut after turn 42 at (3,4), I must move D to (3,3) or other, but only D possible, as U, L, R blocked.\n\nIn positions after turn 42 head at (3,4), (3,5) occupied, (2,4) occupied, (4,4) occupied, so only (3,3) down.\n\nSo move D to (3,3)\n\nThen turn 43 at (3,3), I can move D to (3,2) or R to (4,3)\n\nSay move D to (3,2) to go down.\n\nThen turn 44 at (3,2), move to (4,2) or (3,1)\n\nSay move to (4,2) to go right.\n\nThen turn 45 at (4,2), move to (4,1) or (4,3) or (5,2) or (3,2) occupied.\n\n(4,1) may be free, (4,3) free, (5,2) free.\n\nI can choose.\n\nBut for the output, I need to specify the actions.\n\nSince the food at (1,3) is there, I can plan to go left.\n\nBut from (3,2), if I move to (3,1) at turn 44.\n\nAt turn 43 at (3,3), move D to (3,2) or R to (4,3).\n\nIf I move R to (4,3) at turn 43.\n\nThen head to (4,3), last direction R.\n\nThen from (4,3), move to (4,2), (4,4) occupied, (3,3) occupied, (5,3) occupied.\n\nSo only to (4,2).\n\nThen turn 44 move to (4,2), then from there similar.\n\nNot much difference.\n\nI think for simplicity, I'll go with eating the food.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: L\n\nTurn 42: L (to eat (3,4))\n\nTurn 43: D (to (3,3))\n\nTurn 44: D (to (3,2))\n\nThen for turn 45, I can move to (4,2) or (3,1), but since I need to output, perhaps stop at 5 turns.\n\nThe format says \"Turn t1: action, Turn t1+1: action, ...\" so I should output for a few turns.\n\nSince it says \"Think 5+ turns ahead\", outputting 5 actions might be good.\n\nBut for turn 45, it depends.\n\nPerhaps I can output up to turn 44.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nAnother thing: the food at (5,4) life span 4, so at turn 40, if not eaten, turn 41 life 3, etc.\n\nBut I eat it at turn 40, so fine.\n\n(3,4) eaten at turn 42.\n\nThen (1,3) still there.\n\nAfter turn 44 at (3,2), I can move to (4,2) or (3,1).\n\nMove to (4,2) to go towards the center.\n\nThen from (4,2) to (4,1) or (4,3) or (5,2).\n\nSay to (5,2) to go right.\n\nThen to (6,2), etc.\n\nBut I think for the answer, I'll output 5 turns.\n\nSo for turn 40 to 44.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: L\n\nTurn 42: L\n\nTurn 43: D\n\nTurn 44: D\n\nBut turn 43 and 44 are down, from (3,3) to (3,2), then (3,2) to (3,1) or (4,2), but I said D to (3,2), then D to (3,1) or something.\n\nAt turn 43: at (3,3), move D to (3,2)\n\nTurn 44: at (3,2), move D to (3,1) if possible, but (3,1) may be occupied or not.\n\nIn the positions after turn 43 move to (3,2), let's not assume.\n\nSince the state changes, but for planning, it's ok.\n\nI think it's fine.\n</think>\n### Analysis and Plan\n\nTo maximize the score while prioritizing long-term survival, I have analyzed the current state and planned 5+ turns ahead. The key considerations are:\n- **Immediate Risks**: Moving up (U) to (5,4) eats the positive food (+1 score, length increases) but forces a left (L) move on the next turn due to body constraints. This is acceptable as it secures a short-lived food (life span 4, disappears after turn 43).\n- **Food Prioritization**: \n  - (5,4) must be eaten soon due to short life span (only 4 turns left, including turn 40). \n  - (3,4) has a longer life span (10 turns) and can be eaten shortly after. \n  - (1,3) has a long life span (7 turns) and will be targeted later for safety.\n- **Survival Focus**: After eating (5,4) and (3,4), the snake must navigate downward to avoid dead ends. Moving down (D) from (3,3) and (3,2) opens up space near the bottom, where fewer body segments exist. This prevents trapping and maintains flexibility.\n- **Collision Avoidance**: \n  - No tail reward danger here, as the tail (initially at (5,1)) is not adjacent to the head. \n  - Wall and body collisions are avoided by not moving into occupied cells or walls.\n- **5-Turn Plan**: \n  1. **Turn 40**: Move U to eat (5,4) (immediate reward, avoids missing short-lived food).\n  2. **Turn 41**: Move L to (4,4) (only safe move after U; avoids body collisions).\n  3. **Turn 42**: Move L to eat (3,4) (secures another reward; from (4,4), L is safe and eats food).\n  4. **Turn 43**: Move D to (3,3) (only safe move after eating (3,4); avoids body collisions).\n  5. **Turn 44**: Move D to (3,2) (opens path to less crowded areas; sets up for future movement toward (1,3) or other food).\n\n**Beyond Turn 44**: \n- From (3,2), possible moves include right (R) to (4,2) or down (D) to (3,1) if free, aiming to navigate toward the bottom-left where (1,3) is located. The snake has room to maneuver, and (1,3) can be targeted around turns 45-47 if feasible.\n\nThis plan scores +2 in 3 turns while ensuring survival for at least 5 turns. It prioritizes eating high-urgency food first and avoids risky paths that could lead to dead ends.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 40: U \\\\\nTurn 41: L \\\\\nTurn 42: L \\\\\nTurn 43: D \\\\\nTurn 44: D\n}",
