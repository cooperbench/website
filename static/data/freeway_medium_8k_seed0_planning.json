        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0,0) at turn t1 = 0, and I need to get to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The actions are U (up), D (down), or S (stay), which change the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but y is clamped between 0 and 9.\n\nThe collision condition is that at turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The span changes over time based on the car's direction and speed.\n\nImportantly, when you move to a new freeway, you're not on that freeway until the next turn. So if at turn T you're on y_T and you move to y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, then at turn T, you're still on y_T, and you only check for cars on y_T at that turn. At turn T+1, you're on y_{T+1}, so you check for cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9, which is the top, and since y=9 has no cars (freeways are y=1 to 8), once I'm on y=9, I don't have to worry about cars. But I need to get there safely.\n\nNow, let's list the car states for each freeway at turn t1=0.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, (head=48, tail=37, direction=right, speed=3). Since it's right-moving, the span at time T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]? Let me check the rule.\n\nFor right-moving: Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nHead and tail: the head is the front, tail is the back. For right-moving, as time increases, the car moves to the right, so positions increase.\n\nAt t1, span is [τ, h] for right-moving, so [37,48] since head=48, tail=37, so tail to head is from 37 to 48.\n\nThen at time T, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [37 + 3(T-0), 48 + 3(T-0)] for freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut collision is when 0 is in the span at turn T for the freeway y_T.\n\n0 is the x-position where the player is, since player is at (0,y), so we care if x=0 is occupied by a car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nNow, freeway 2,3,4 have multiple cars. Let's see:\n\nFreeway 2: three cars:\n\n1. (-48, -59, right, 12) — but head=-48, tail=-59? That seems odd because usually head should be greater than tail for right-moving, but here tail=-59, head=-48, so from -59 to -48, which is increasing, so it's right-moving. Span at T: [τ + sT, h + sT] = [-59 + 12T, -48 + 12T]\n\n2. (-12, -23, right, 12): tail=-23, head=-12, so [-23 + 12T, -12 + 12T]\n\n3. (24, 13, right, 12): tail=13, head=24, so [13 + 12T, 24 + 12T]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 3 and 4, they have the same cars? The table shows the same for 2,3,4.\n\nFreeway 3: same as 2: (-48,-59,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12), (24,13,right,12)\n\nFreeway 4: same\n\nFreeway 5: (48,37,right,6) — tail=37, head=48, speed=6, so [37 + 6T, 48 + 6T]\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5: (48,37,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7: (-48,-59,right,4) — tail=-59, head=-48, speed=4, so [-59 + 4T, -48 + 4T]\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7: (-48,-59,right,4)\n\nAnd freeway 1 is different: (48,37,right,3) so [37 + 3T, 48 + 3T]\n\nNow, the player starts at y=0 at T=0. y=0 has no cars, so it's safe.\n\nI need to go to y=9, moving through y=1 to y=8, but avoiding when a car is at x=0.\n\nSince the actions change y, and I need to minimize turns, probably I want to move up as much as possible, but I have to avoid the cars.\n\nThe minimal H would be if I can go directly up, but y=9 is 9 steps away, so H at least 9, but I might have to wait or detour if there are cars blocking.\n\nBut since I can only move one step at a time, and S to stay, I might need to wait on a freeway if it's safe.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, when x=0 is occupied, i.e., when 0 is in the car span for that freeway.\n\nFor a given freeway k, and time T, we need to solve for T such that 0 is in one of the car spans on that freeway.\n\nSince multiple cars, I need to find if any car covers x=0 at time T.\n\nLet me define the times when it's unsafe for each freeway.\n\nStart with freeway 1: one car, span [37 + 3T, 48 + 3T]\n\n0 in [37+3T, 48+3T] when 37+3T ≤ 0 ≤ 48+3T\n\nSince 37+3T ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 48+3T, but 37+3T ≤ 0 implies T ≤ -37/3 ≈ -12.333, and 0 ≤ 48+3T implies T ≥ -16, but T is time from t1=0, so T≥0, so 37+3T >0 for T≥0, so 0 is never in [37+3T,48+3T] for T≥0 because 37+3T ≥37>0. So freeway 1 is always safe? [37+3T,48+3T], min is 37 at T=0, which is >0, and increases, so yes, 0 is always left of the car, never covered. So freeway 1 has no car at x=0 for any T≥0.\n\nNow freeway 2: three cars.\n\nFirst car: [-59 + 12T, -48 + 12T]\n\n0 in this when -59+12T ≤ 0 ≤ -48+12T\n\nSo -59+12T ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -48+12T\n\nFirst: -59+12T ≤ 0 => 12T ≤ 59 => T ≤ 59/12 ≈ 4.916\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48+12T => 12T ≥ 48 => T ≥ 4\n\nSo for T in [4, 4.916], approximately [4, 59/12]\n\nBut T integer, so T=4? 59/12=4.916, so T=4 and T=5? Let's see.\n\nAt T=4: -59+12*4 = -59+48= -11, -48+12*4= -48+48=0, so span [-11,0], and 0 is included? [ -11, 0 ] includes 0, since tail and head, inclusive I assume.\n\nThe span is closed interval I think, since it says \"span\" and collision if 0 in span.\n\nSo at T=4, span is [-11,0], 0 is included, so unsafe.\n\nAt T=5: -59+12*5= -59+60=1, -48+60=12, span [1,12], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nNow second car on freeway 2: [-23 +12T, -12 +12T]\n\n0 in this when -23+12T ≤ 0 ≤ -12+12T\n\nSo -23+12T ≤ 0 => 12T ≤ 23 => T ≤ 23/12 ≈ 1.916\n\n0 ≤ -12+12T => 12T ≥12 => T ≥1\n\nSo T from 1 to 1.916, integer T=1? T=1: -23+12= -11, -12+12=0, span [-11,0], 0 included, unsafe.\n\nT=2: -23+24=1, -12+24=12, [1,12], safe.\n\nThird car: [13+12T, 24+12T], min 13>0, so never covers 0, safe always.\n\nSo for freeway 2, unsafe when T=1 (from second car) and T=4 (from first car).\n\nT=1 and T=4.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2, since same cars, so unsafe at T=1 and T=4.\n\nSimilarly freeway 4: same, unsafe at T=1 and T=4.\n\nNow freeway 5: one car [37+6T, 48+6T], min 37>0, never covers 0, so always safe.\n\nSimilarly freeway 6: same, always safe.\n\nFreeway 7: one car, [-59 +4T, -48 +4T]\n\n0 in this when -59+4T ≤ 0 ≤ -48+4T\n\n-59+4T ≤ 0 => 4T ≤59 => T ≤ 59/4 = 14.75\n\n0 ≤ -48+4T => 4T ≥48 => T ≥12\n\nSo T from 12 to 14.75, integer T=12,13,14.\n\nAt T=12: -59+48= -11, -48+48=0, span [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nT=13: -59+52= -7, -48+52=4, span [-7,4], includes 0.\n\nT=14: -59+56= -3, -48+56=8, span [-3,8], includes 0.\n\nT=15: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, [1,12], not include 0.\n\nSo unsafe at T=12,13,14.\n\nSimilarly freeway 8: same as 7, unsafe at T=12,13,14.\n\nNow freeway 1 was always safe, freeway 5 and 6 always safe.\n\ny=1: freeway 1, always safe.\n\ny=2: freeway 2, unsafe at T=1,4\n\ny=3: freeway 3, unsafe at T=1,4\n\ny=4: freeway 4, unsafe at T=1,4\n\ny=5: freeway 5, always safe\n\ny=6: freeway 6, always safe\n\ny=7: freeway 7, unsafe at T=12,13,14\n\ny=8: freeway 8, unsafe at T=12,13,14\n\nThe player starts at y=0, T=0. y=0 has no cars, so safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9, which is safe always.\n\nSince I move one y-step per turn, but I can stay, so I might spend multiple turns on a freeway if safe.\n\nThe minimal H is at least 9, if I go up every turn.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on unsafe freeways at unsafe times.\n\nLet me denote the time when I arrive at each y-level.\n\nSet T=0 at start, position y=0.\n\nAt turn T, I am at position y_T.\n\nAfter action, at turn T+1, I am at y_{T+1}.\n\nThe collision is checked at each turn T for the freeway y_T.\n\nSo when I am at y=k at turn T, I need that for freeway k, at time T, it is safe, i.e., no car at x=0.\n\nThen I perform action to go to next y.\n\nI start at T=0, y=0.\n\nAfter action at T=0, I go to y_1 at T=1.\n\nAt T=0, y=0, safe.\n\nAt T=1, I am at y_1, which could be 0 or 1, depending on action at T=0.\n\nIf I go up, y_1=1, then at T=1, I am on y=1, freeway 1, which is always safe, so ok.\n\nThen at T=1, I can choose next action.\n\nBut I need to plan the sequence.\n\nSince the unsafe times are only for y=2,3,4 at T=1 and T=4, and y=7,8 at T=12,13,14.\n\ny=1,5,6 are always safe.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe critical points are to avoid y=2,3,4 when T=1 or T=4, and avoid y=7,8 when T=12,13,14.\n\nSince T=1 is early, and I start at T=0, I might not be on y=2,3,4 at T=1 if I don't move too fast.\n\nSimilarly, T=4 is later.\n\nAlso, T=12,13,14 are late, so if I go fast, I might be past y=8 before T=12.\n\nMinimal time: if I go up every turn, I can be at y=9 at T=9.\n\nNow, check for each step if safe.\n\nAt T=0, y=0, safe.\n\nAction at T=0: U, to y=1 at T=1.\n\nAt T=1, y=1, freeway 1, always safe, so ok.\n\nAction at T=1: U, to y=2 at T=2.\n\nNow at T=2, y=2, freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2 unsafe at T=1 and T=4.\n\nAt T=2, is it safe? Earlier we said for freeway 2, unsafe only at T=1 and T=4.\n\nAt T=2, all cars: first car at T=2: [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35, -24]? -59+12*2= -59+24= -35, -48+24= -24, so [-35,-24], not include 0.\n\nSecond car: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], not include 0.\n\nThird: [13+24,24+24]=[37,48], not.\n\nSo safe at T=2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3 and 4 same at T=2, should be safe since unsafe only at T=1,4.\n\nSo at T=2, y=2 safe.\n\nAction U to y=3 at T=3.\n\nAt T=3, y=3, freeway 3.\n\nUnsafe at T=1 and T=4? T=3 not 1 or 4, so should be safe.\n\nCheck: similar to above, at T=3, freeway 3 cars:\n\nFirst car: [-59+36, -48+36] = [-23,-12], not 0.\n\nSecond: [-23+36, -12+36]? For freeway 3 same as 2.\n\n-23+12*3= -23+36=13, -12+36=24, so [13,24], not 0? Earlier at T=1 it was unsafe, but at T=3.\n\nSecond car: tail=-23, head=-12, at T: [-23+12T, -12+12T]\n\nAt T=3: -23+36=13, -12+36=24, [13,24], 0 not in.\n\nFirst car: [-59+12T, -48+12T] at T=3: -59+36= -23, -48+36= -12, [-23,-12], not 0.\n\nThird: [13+36,24+36]=[49,60], not.\n\nSo safe at T=3.\n\nAction U to y=4 at T=4.\n\nAt T=4, y=4, freeway 4.\n\nBut freeway 4 unsafe at T=4! As we said earlier.\n\nAt T=4, for freeway 4, first car: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0], 0 included, unsafe.\n\nSo collision if I am on y=4 at T=4.\n\nBut in this path, I would be at y=4 at T=4, so unsafe.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be on y=4 at T=4.\n\nSimilarly, I cannot be on y=2 or y=3 at T=4 either? Freeway 2 and 3 are also unsafe at T=4.\n\nBut at T=4, if I am on y=4, it's unsafe.\n\nIn the direct path, I arrive at y=4 at T=4, which is bad.\n\nI need to avoid that.\n\nOptions:\n\n- Delay arriving at y=4, so not at T=4.\n\n- Or be on a different freeway at T=4.\n\nSince y=1,5,6 are safe, I could be on one of them at T=4.\n\nBut I need to go to y=4 eventually.\n\nSince I am at y=3 at T=3, which is safe, instead of going up to y=4 at T=4, I could stay on y=3 or go down, but going down might not help.\n\nAt T=3, y=3, safe.\n\nI could do S (stay) at T=3, so at T=4, I am still at y=3.\n\nBut y=3 at T=4 is unsafe! Because freeway 3 unsafe at T=4.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 at T=4 unsafe, y=4 at T=4 unsafe.\n\nOnly y=1,5,6 are safe at T=4.\n\nBut I am at y=3 at T=3, I can go to y=2, y=3, or y=4.\n\nBut y=4 at T=4 unsafe, y=3 at T=4 unsafe, y=2 at T=4 unsafe.\n\nSo if I stay or go down to y=2 at T=4, I am on unsafe freeway.\n\nIf I go up to y=4, unsafe.\n\nSo from y=3 at T=3, no matter what I do for action at T=3, at T=4 I will be on y=2,3, or4, all unsafe at T=4.\n\nProblem.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be at y=3 at T=3? But at T=3, y=3 is safe, but the issue is the next turn.\n\nI need to not be on levels 2,3,4 at time T=4.\n\nSimilarly, for T=1, but T=1 is early.\n\nIn this case, at T=3, I need to be on a safe level at T=4, but from y=3, I can only go to y=2,3,4, all unsafe at T=4.\n\nSo I must not be on y=3 at T=3, because I would be forced to be unsafe at T=4.\n\nSimilarly, if I were on y=2 at T=3, same issue.\n\nAt T=2, I was at y=2, safe.\n\nFrom there, I could have gone to y=1, y=2, or y=3.\n\nIf I go to y=3 at T=3, as above, stuck.\n\nIf I stay at y=2 at T=3, then at T=3, y=2: freeway 2 at T=3.\n\nIs it safe? Earlier at T=3, freeway 2: as above, cars not at 0, so safe.\n\nThen at T=4, if I am still at y=2, unsafe.\n\nIf I go down to y=1 at T=3? Action at T=2: D, to y=1 at T=3.\n\nThen at T=3, y=1, freeway 1, always safe.\n\nThen at T=3, I am at y=1.\n\nNow action at T=3: I can go to y=0, y=1, or y=2.\n\nAt T=4, I need to be on a safe freeway.\n\ny=0 is safe (no cars), y=1 safe, y=2 unsafe at T=4, y=3 unsafe, etc.\n\nSo I can stay at y=1 or go to y=0 or y=2, but y=2 unsafe at T=4.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nSince y=1 is safe at T=4, I can stay at y=1 for T=4.\n\nBut that might take extra turns.\n\nI could go to y=5 or something, but I'm at y=1.\n\nAnother idea: at T=2, instead of going to y=3, I could go directly to a safe freeway.\n\nBut from y=2, I can only go to y=1,2,3.\n\nAll except y=1 are problematic at T=4.\n\nBut y=1 is safe.\n\nSo let's backtrack.\n\nStart from beginning.\n\nT=0, y=0, safe.\n\nAction: U to y=1 at T=1.\n\nT=1, y=1, safe (freeway 1 always safe).\n\nNow at T=1, action: I could go U to y=2, but at T=2, y=2 is safe, as we saw.\n\nBut if I go U to y=2 at T=2, then I have the problem at T=4.\n\nTo avoid being on y=2,3,4 at T=4, I need to either be below or above at T=4.\n\nSince y=1 is safe at T=4, I could stay on y=1 until after T=4.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 is safe, but I'm at y=1.\n\nAt T=1, y=1, I could do S (stay) or D (down) or U.\n\nIf I do S at T=1, then at T=2, I am at y=1.\n\nThen at T=2, y=1, safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can stay or move.\n\nBut I need to go up.\n\nSince T=4 is the problem, I can delay moving up so that I am not on y=2,3,4 at T=4.\n\nFor example, I can stay on y=0 or y=1 until T=5 or something.\n\nBut let's think about the timing.\n\nI start at T=0, y=0.\n\nSuppose I stay at y=0 for some turns, but y=0 has no cars, so safe, but I need to move up eventually.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 is always safe.\n\nSo I can stay on y=1 during T=4.\n\nThen after T=4, I can move up.\n\nBut T=4 is only for y=2,3,4, other times are safe except the late times for y=7,8.\n\nFirst, let's handle the T=4 issue.\n\nMinimal time might be more than 9.\n\nList the unsafe times:\n\nFor y=2: unsafe at T=1,4\n\ny=3: unsafe at T=1,4\n\ny=4: unsafe at T=1,4\n\ny=7: unsafe at T=12,13,14\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=12,13,14\n\nOther freeways always safe.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, I need to pass through each y from 0 to 9.\n\nBut I can skip some or stay, but I have to be on each y at some point, but not necessarily, I can go directly, but since I move one step, I must visit each integer y in sequence if I go up, but I can stay or go down, so I might not visit all, but to go from 0 to 9, I must reach each y from 0 to 9 at some point, but not necessarily in order if I go down, but that would be inefficient, so probably go up directly with possible waits.\n\nBut in this case, since only specific times are unsafe, I can plan the timing.\n\nI need to be at y=k at time T, such that for that k and T, it is safe.\n\nThen the actions are determined by the path.\n\nStart from T=0, y=0.\n\nI need to choose the time to move to each level.\n\nSince y=1 is always safe, I can go to y=1 at T=1.\n\nThen at y=1, I can stay for multiple turns if needed.\n\nThen when I go to y=2, I need to be at a time when y=2 is safe, i.e., not T=1 or T=4.\n\nSimilarly for y=3 and y=4.\n\ny=2,3,4 all have the same unsafe times: T=1 and T=4.\n\nSo I need to be on y=2, y=3, y=4 at times not 1 or 4.\n\nFor example, T=2,3,5,6,... etc.\n\nSimilarly for later.\n\nFirst, from y=1, I can go to y=2 at a safe time.\n\nFor instance, at T=2, y=2 is safe, as we saw.\n\nThen from y=2, I can go to y=3 at T=3, which is safe for y=3.\n\nThen from y=3, if I go to y=4 at T=4, it is unsafe.\n\nSo I cannot go to y=4 at T=4.\n\nTherefore, at T=3, I should not go to y=4; instead, I can stay at y=3 or go back to y=2.\n\nBut at T=4, both y=3 and y=2 are unsafe.\n\nSo I must not be on y=2,3,4 at T=4.\n\nTherefore, at T=4, I need to be on y=1 or y=5 or y=6 or y=0 or y=7,8,9 but y=7,8 might be unsafe later, but at T=4, y=7 and y=8 are safe since their unsafe times are later.\n\nAt T=4, y=7: freeway 7, unsafe only at T=12,13,14, so at T=4, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=8 safe at T=4.\n\nBut I am at y=3 at T=3, I can't jump to y=5 or something; I can only move to adjacent y.\n\nSo from y=3 at T=3, I can only be at y=2,3,4 at T=4, all unsafe.\n\nTherefore, the only way is to not be at y=3 at T=3.\n\nSimilarly, not at y=2 at T=3 if I plan to be there at T=4, but since T=4 is bad, I need to be elsewhere at T=4.\n\nSo let's go back to T=2.\n\nAt T=2, I am at y=2, safe.\n\nInstead of going to y=3, I can go down to y=1 or stay at y=2.\n\nIf I stay at y=2 at T=3, then at T=3, y=2 is safe (since not T=1 or T=4), but then at T=4, if I am still at y=2, unsafe.\n\nIf at T=3 I go down to y=1, then at T=3, y=1, safe.\n\nThen at T=4, I am at y=1, which is safe.\n\nThen I can proceed from there.\n\nSo that works, but it takes an extra turn.\n\nSimilarly, I could have stayed at y=1 longer.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nStart:\n\nT=0, y=0, action U to y=1 at T=1.\n\nT=1, y=1, action U to y=2 at T=2.  // since at T=1, y=1 safe, and I go to y=2 at T=2.\n\nT=2, y=2, safe.\n\nNow at T=2, instead of U, I do D to y=1 at T=3.  // to avoid being on y=2,3,4 at T=4.\n\nAction at T=2: D, so y_{T=3} = y_2 + Δy = 2 + (-1) =1.\n\nAt T=3, I am at y=1, safe.\n\nThen at T=3, action: I can do S or U or D.\n\nBut I need to go up, so U to y=2 at T=4.\n\nBut at T=4, y=2 is unsafe! Because freeway 2 unsafe at T=4.\n\nIf I do S at T=3, stay at y=1, then at T=4, y=1, safe.\n\nThen at T=4, I can go to y=2.\n\nBut at T=4, y=2 is unsafe, so I cannot go to y=2 at T=4.\n\nAt T=4, if I go to y=2, I arrive at T=4, so at T=4, I am on y=2, which is unsafe.\n\nSo I should not go to y=2 at T=4.\n\nSimilarly, not to y=3 or y=4 at T=4.\n\nSo at T=3, at y=1, I can do S to stay at y=1 for T=4.\n\nThen at T=4, y=1, safe.\n\nThen at T=4, I can go to y=2, but only if T=4 is safe for y=2, which it is not.\n\nSo I need to go to y=2 at a different time.\n\nThe next safe time for y=2 is T=5, for example.\n\nAt T=4, y=1, I can do U to go to y=2 at T=5.\n\nThen at T=5, y=2.\n\nNow, is y=2 safe at T=5?\n\nFreeway 2 at T=5: first car [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12], not 0.\n\nSecond car [-23+60, -12+60] = [37,48], not 0? -23+60=37, -12+60=48, [37,48].\n\nThird [13+60,24+60]=[73,84], not 0.\n\nSo safe at T=5.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 and y=4 safe at T=5.\n\nAlso, T=5 not 1 or 4, so safe.\n\nThen I can proceed.\n\nSimilarly for later.\n\nNow, about the late times, T=12,13,14 for y=7,8.\n\nIf I go at normal speed, I might be at y=7 or 8 around T=7 or 8, which is before T=12, so safe, as long as I don't delay too much.\n\nFirst, let's plan the early part.\n\nSequence:\n\nT=0: y=0, action U to y=1 at T=1\n\nT=1: y=1, action U to y=2 at T=2  // since I can, and T=2 safe for y=2\n\nT=2: y=2, but now I need to avoid being on y=2,3,4 at T=4.\n\nSince T=4 is coming, I can go down to y=1.\n\nAction at T=2: D to y=1 at T=3\n\nT=3: y=1, action S to stay at y=1 for T=4  // since at T=4, I want to be on y=1\n\nAt T=4, y=1, safe.\n\nThen at T=4, I can do U to go to y=2 at T=5.\n\nT=5: y=2, now safe (as above)\n\nThen action U to y=3 at T=6\n\nT=6: y=3, should be safe? Freeway 3 at T=6.\n\nCars: first [-59+72, -48+72] = [13,24], not 0\n\nSecond [-23+72, -12+72] = [49,60], not 0\n\nThird [13+72,24+72]=[85,96], not 0. Safe.\n\nAction U to y=4 at T=7\n\nT=7: y=4, similarly, at T=7, freeway 4 cars:\n\nFirst [-59+84, -48+84] = [25,36], not 0? -59+12*7= -59+84=25, -48+84=36, [25,36]\n\nSecond [-23+84, -12+84] = [61,72], not\n\nThird [13+84,24+84]=[97,108], not. Safe.\n\nAction U to y=5 at T=8\n\nT=8: y=5, freeway 5, always safe, so ok.\n\nAction U to y=6 at T=9\n\nT=9: y=6, freeway 6, always safe, ok.\n\nAction U to y=7 at T=10\n\nNow y=7, freeway 7, unsafe at T=12,13,14.\n\nAt T=10, is it safe? Freeway 7 car: [-59 +4T, -48 +4T]\n\nAt T=10: -59+40= -19, -48+40= -8, span [-19,-8], not include 0, so safe.\n\nAction U to y=8 at T=11\n\nT=11: y=8, freeway 8, similar car, at T=11: [-59+44, -48+44] = [-15,-4], not 0, safe.\n\nAction U to y=9 at T=12\n\nT=12: y=9, which is not a freeway, no cars, so safe. And I reached y=9.\n\nBut at T=12, I arrive at y=9, so at T=12, I am on y=9, safe.\n\nNow, check if at any point I was on unsafe freeway.\n\nT=0: y=0, safe\n\nT=1: y=1, safe\n\nT=2: y=2, safe\n\nT=3: y=1, safe (after moving down)\n\nT=4: y=1, safe\n\nT=5: y=2, safe\n\nT=6: y=3, safe\n\nT=7: y=4, safe\n\nT=8: y=5, safe\n\nT=9: y=6, safe\n\nT=10: y=7, safe\n\nT=11: y=8, safe\n\nT=12: y=9, safe\n\nAll good.\n\nI reached at T=12, so H=13? Let's see.\n\nThe turns: from T=0 to T=12, that's 13 turns? No.\n\nThe sequence of actions.\n\nAt turn t, I perform action, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nIn the state, at turn t, position is (0, y_t)\n\nThen I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at (0, y_{t+1})\n\nCollision at turn t if on freeway y_t and 0 in car span at time t.\n\nIn this case, t from t1=0.\n\nAt turn t=0: position y=0, not freeway, safe. Action a_0 = U, so y_1 = 0 +1 =1\n\nAt turn t=1: position y=1, freeway 1, at time t=1, safe. Action a_1 = U, so y_2 =1+1=2\n\nAt turn t=2: position y=2, freeway 2, time t=2, safe (as before). Action a_2 = D, so y_3 =2 + (-1) =1\n\nAt turn t=3: position y=1, freeway 1, time t=3, safe. Action a_3 = S, so y_4 =1 +0 =1\n\nAt turn t=4: position y=1, freeway 1, time t=4, safe. Action a_4 = U, so y_5 =1+1=2\n\nAt turn t=5: position y=2, freeway 2, time t=5, safe. Action a_5 = U, so y_6=2+1=3\n\nAt turn t=6: position y=3, freeway 3, time t=6, safe. Action a_6 = U, so y_7=3+1=4\n\nAt turn t=7: position y=4, freeway 4, time t=7, safe. Action a_7 = U, so y_8=4+1=5\n\nAt turn t=8: position y=5, freeway 5, time t=8, safe. Action a_8 = U, so y_9=5+1=6\n\nAt turn t=9: position y=6, freeway 6, time t=9, safe. Action a_9 = U, so y_10=6+1=7\n\nAt turn t=10: position y=7, freeway 7, time t=10, span: [-59+4*10, -48+4*10] = [-59+40, -48+40] = [-19,-8], not include 0, safe. Action a_10 = U, so y_11=7+1=8\n\nAt turn t=11: position y=8, freeway 8, time t=11, similar, [-59+44, -48+44]=[-15,-4], not 0, safe. Action a_11 = U, so y_12=8+1=9\n\nAt turn t=12: position y=9, not freeway, safe. And y=9 reached.\n\nNow, I performed actions from t=0 to t=11, that's 12 actions, and at t=12, I am at y=9.\n\nThe number of turns H: I need to reach at some turn, and H is the number of actions.\n\nThe sequence is from t=0 to t=H-1, and after H actions, I am at y=9 at turn t_1 + H.\n\nt_1=0, so after H actions, at turn H, position (0,9).\n\nIn this case, at turn 12, y=9, so H=12, since actions from t=0 to t=11.\n\nt from 0 to 11, 12 actions, H=12.\n\nMinimal H: since 9 steps up, but I took an extra down and stay, so 12 actions.\n\nBut is there a way with fewer?\n\nFor example, without going down.\n\nSuppose at T=0, y=0, U to y=1 at T=1\n\nT=1, y=1, instead of U, I do S to stay at y=1 for T=2.\n\nBut at T=2, y=1, safe, but I need to go to y=2.\n\nIf I go to y=2 at T=3? But T=3 is safe for y=2.\n\nThen at T=3, y=2, safe.\n\nThen I can go to y=3 at T=4, but T=4 unsafe for y=3.\n\nProblem.\n\nFrom y=2 at T=3, I cannot go to y=3 at T=4 because T=4 unsafe.\n\nIf I go to y=3 at T=5, but from y=2 at T=3, I can stay at y=2 or go down or up.\n\nIf I stay at y=2 at T=4, unsafe.\n\nIf I go down to y=1 at T=4, then at T=4, y=1 safe.\n\nBut then I have to go back up.\n\nSimilarly inefficient.\n\nAfter being at y=1 for T=1, I can stay longer.\n\nFor example:\n\nT=0: y=0, U to y=1 at T=1\n\nT=1: y=1, S to stay at y=1 for T=2\n\nT=2: y=1, S to stay at y=1 for T=3\n\nT=3: y=1, U to y=2 at T=4? But at T=4, if I go to y=2, arrive at T=4, unsafe.\n\nCannot.\n\nAt T=3, y=1, S to stay for T=4.\n\nT=4: y=1, safe, then U to y=2 at T=5.\n\nThen proceed as before.\n\nBut I spent more time staying at y=1.\n\nIn previous sequence, I went to y=2 at T=2, then down to y=1 at T=3, stay at T=4, then up at T=5.\n\nSame number of actions as going directly to y=1 and staying multiple times, but with the down, I used one extra action.\n\nIn the sequence I have, from start to y=1 at T=1, then to y=2 at T=2, then down to y=1 at T=3, stay at T=4 (y=1), then up to y=2 at T=5, etc.\n\nCompared to going to y=1 and staying: T=0 to y=1, T=1 y=1, T=2 y=1 (stay), T=3 y=1 (stay), T=4 y=1 (stay), then U to y=2 at T=5.\n\nBut I can go earlier: at T=1, I am at y=1, I can go to y=2 at T=2 or later.\n\nEarliest I can go to y=2 is T=2, safe.\n\nThen I need to leave before T=4 or something, but I have to go to y=3 and y=4.\n\nThe critical point is that I must not be on y=2,3,4 at T=4.\n\nSo I can be on y=2 at T=2 and T=3, both safe, but then at T=4 I need to be not there.\n\nBut from y=2 at T=3, I can only go to y=1,2,3, all bad at T=4.\n\nSo I must leave y=2 before T=4, meaning at T=3 I go down to y=1.\n\nThen at T=4, I can be on y=1.\n\nThen go up after T=4.\n\nI think 12 is minimal for this part.\n\nNow for the later part, in my sequence, I reached y=9 at T=12, and since T=12,13,14 are unsafe for y=7,8, but I was on y=7 at T=10, y=8 at T=11, both before T=12, so safe.\n\nIf I go faster, I might be at y=7 or 8 later, but since I started early, I'm fine.\n\nBut in this sequence, H=12 actions.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions:\n\nTurn t=0: a_0 = U\n\nt=1: a_1 = U\n\nt=2: a_2 = D\n\nt=3: a_3 = S\n\nt=4: a_4 = U\n\nt=5: a_5 = U\n\nt=6: a_6 = U\n\nt=7: a_7 = U\n\nt=8: a_8 = U\n\nt=9: a_9 = U\n\nt=10: a_10 = U\n\nt=11: a_11 = U\n\nAnd at turn t=12, y=9.\n\nNow, is there a sequence with H=11 or less?\n\nSuppose I go directly but avoid T=4.\n\nFor example, from y=1 at T=1, I stay until T=5, but that takes more stays.\n\nT=0: U to y=1\n\nT=1: S (y=1)\n\nT=2: S (y=1)\n\nT=3: S (y=1)\n\nT=4: S (y=1) // at T=4, y=1 safe\n\nT=5: U to y=2\n\nThen T=5: y=2, U to y=3 at T=6\n\nT=6: y=3, U to y=4 at T=7\n\nT=7: y=4, U to y=5 at T=8\n\nT=8: y=5, U to y=6 at T=9\n\nT=9: y=6, U to y=7 at T=10\n\nT=10: y=7, U to y=8 at T=11\n\nT=11: y=8, U to y=9 at T=12\n\nSame as before, but I stayed at y=1 from T=1 to T=4, so actions: t=0:U, t=1:S, t=2:S, t=3:S, t=4:S? At turn t, action determines next y.\n\nAt t=0: U, to y=1 at t=1\n\nt=1: position y=1, action S, to y=1 at t=2 (since Δy=0)\n\nt=2: position y=1, action S, to y=1 at t=3\n\nt=3: position y=1, action S, to y=1 at t=4\n\nt=4: position y=1, action U, to y=2 at t=5\n\nt=5: position y=2, action U, to y=3 at t=6\n\n...\n\nUp to t=11: at y=8, U to y=9 at t=12.\n\nSo actions from t=0 to t=11, H=12, same as before.\n\nIn the first sequence, I went up to y=2 and back, which also took 12 actions.\n\nNow, for the late times, in this sequence, I am at y=7 at t=10, y=8 at t=11, both before t=12, so safe.\n\nIf I could be faster, but I have the delay at the beginning.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=5 or 6 quickly, since they are always safe.\n\nFor example, from start:\n\nT=0: U to y=1\n\nT=1: U to y=2\n\nT=2: U to y=3? But at T=3, y=3 safe, but then at T=3, if I U to y=4 at T=4, unsafe.\n\nCannot.\n\nAt T=2, y=2, I can go U to y=3 at T=3, safe, but then stuck.\n\nNo, I think I have to have the extra actions.\n\nPerhaps go to y=4 after T=4.\n\nBut earliest to y=4 is T=4, but unsafe, so T=5 or later.\n\nIn my sequence, I go to y=4 at T=7, which is fine.\n\nBut in the sequence, I reached y=9 at T=12.\n\nNow, about y=7 and y=8, since I am at T=10 and T=11, which is before T=12, safe.\n\nIf I were slower, I might hit the unsafe times, but here I'm fine.\n\nIn this case, H=12.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can do with H=11.\n\nSuppose I reach y=9 at T=11.\n\nThen I must have y_11=9.\n\nSince I start at y=0 at T=0, to be at y=9 at T=11, I need 9 up moves and possibly some stays or downs, but downs would require more ups, so probably 9 ups and 2 stays or something, but net +9 in y.\n\nThe number of U minus number of D must be 9, and number of S can be some.\n\nTime from T=0 to T=11 is 11 turns, but positions from y=0 to y=9.\n\nLet N_U be number of U, N_D number of D, N_S number of S.\n\nThen N_U - N_D = 9\n\nAnd total actions H = N_U + N_D + N_S\n\nSince N_U = 9 + N_D, so H = (9 + N_D) + N_D + N_S = 9 + 2 N_D + N_S\n\nMinimal H when N_D=0 and N_S=0, H=9, but we saw not possible due to collision.\n\nWith N_D=0, H=9 + N_S, so to minimize H, minimize N_S, but we need N_S to avoid collisions.\n\nWith N_D=1, H=9 + 2(1) + N_S = 11 + N_S\n\nSo minimal H=11 if N_D=1 and N_S=0.\n\nSimilarly, if N_D=0, H=9 + N_S, min 10 if N_S=1, but earlier we saw H=9 not possible, H=10 might be possible?\n\nLet's try.\n\nH=10 actions, reach at T=10.\n\nSequence: actions from t=0 to t=9, position at t=10 is y=9.\n\ny from 0 to 9 in 10 steps, so net +9, so N_U - N_D =9, and N_U + N_D + N_S=10.\n\nSince N_U - N_D=9, and N_U + N_D + N_S=10, add them: 2 N_U + N_S =19, subtract: 2 N_D + N_S=1.\n\nSo possible if N_D=0, N_S=1, then N_U=9.\n\nOr N_D=1, N_S=0, but 2(1) +0=2>1, not integer, impossible.\n\n2 N_D + N_S=1, so N_D=0, N_S=1, N_U=9.\n\nOr N_D=1, N_S=-1, impossible.\n\nSo only possibility: N_D=0, N_S=1, N_U=9.\n\nOne stay, no down moves.\n\nNow, can I reach with one stay?\n\nI need to be at y=9 at T=10.\n\nBut I have to avoid being on y=2,3,4 at T=4.\n\nSince no down, I can only go up or stay once.\n\nStart:\n\nT=0: y=0, action? If U, to y=1 at T=1\n\nT=1: y=1, action: if U, to y=2 at T=2\n\nT=2: y=2, action: if U, to y=3 at T=3\n\nT=3: y=3, action: if U, to y=4 at T=4, but unsafe.\n\nIf at T=3 I do S, then at T=4, y=3, but y=3 at T=4 unsafe, collision.\n\nIf at T=2, I do S, stay at y=2 for T=3.\n\nAt T=3, y=2, safe? Yes, but then at T=3, if I U to y=3 at T=4, unsafe.\n\nIf I stay again, but I have only one S to use.\n\nIf at T=1, I do S, stay at y=1 for T=2.\n\nThen at T=2, y=1, action U to y=2 at T=3\n\nT=3: y=2, action U to y=3 at T=4, but at T=4 y=3 unsafe.\n\nIf at T=3 I do S, then at T=4 y=2 unsafe? y=2 at T=4 unsafe.\n\nNo way.\n\nIf I go slower at start.\n\nT=0: S, stay at y=0 for T=1\n\nBut y=0 safe, no issue.\n\nThen at T=1, y=0? At turn t=0, position y=0, action S, so y_1=0, position at t=1 is y=0.\n\nThen action at t=1: U to y=1 at t=2\n\nThen t=2: y=1, I can U to y=2 at t=3\n\nt=3: y=2, U to y=3 at t=4, unsafe.\n\nOr at t=2, S to stay y=1 for t=3, but I have only one S, if I used at t=0.\n\nIf I use S at t=2.\n\nt=0: U to y=1 at t=1\n\nt=1: y=1, S to y=1 at t=2  // used S\n\nt=2: y=1, U to y=2 at t=3\n\nt=3: y=2, U to y=3 at t=4, unsafe.\n\nIf at t=3, I do S, but no S left, and I must go up.\n\nCannot.\n\nSo it seems impossible to avoid with only one stay; I need to either stay multiple times or go down, but with down, I need extra up.\n\nThus H=12 is minimal.\n\nNow for the late times, in my sequence, I am at y=7 at t=10, y=8 at t=11, both before t=12, so no issue with the late unsafe times.\n\nIf I were to be at y=7 at t=12, it would be unsafe, but I'm at t=10, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo the sequence I have should work.\n\nNow, to write the actions.\n\nt_1 = 0, so turn 0 to turn 11.\n\nAnswer format:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} which is a_0\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_1\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + H-1, which is turn 11.\n\nH=12 actions.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 0: U\n\nTurn 1: U\n\nTurn 2: D\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's list the turns with t_1.\n\nt_1 = 0.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 0: a_{0} = U\n\nTurn 1: a_{1} = U\n\nTurn 2: a_{2} = D\n\nTurn 3: a_{3} = S\n\nTurn 4: a_{4} = U\n\nTurn 5: a_{5} = U\n\nTurn 6: a_{6} = U\n\nTurn 7: a_{7} = U\n\nTurn 8: a_{8} = U\n\nTurn 9: a_{9} = U\n\nTurn 10: a_{10} = U\n\nTurn 11: a_{11} = U\n\nAnd that should be it.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 2, I go down, but since y=2 to y=1, and freeway 1 is safe, no issue.\n\nAnd I avoid the T=4 problem.\n\nNow, just to be thorough, let's check the late part quickly.\n\nAt t=9: position y=6, freeway 6, always safe.\n\nAction U to y=7 at t=10.\n\nAt t=10: position y=7, freeway 7, time t=10, car span: as before, [-59 + 4*10, -48 + 4*10] = [-19,-8], not 0, safe.\n\nAction U to y=8 at t=11.\n\nAt t=11: position y=8, freeway 8, time t=11, car: [-59 + 4*11, -48 + 4*11] = [-59+44, -48+44] = [-15,-4], not 0, safe.\n\nAction U to y=9 at t=12.\n\nAt t=12: y=9, safe.\n\nPerfect.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 0\\) is 12, with the sequence of actions avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe unsafe times for each freeway are:\n- Freeway 1: Always safe (no car covers \\(x = 0\\)).\n- Freeway 2: Unsafe at turns 1 and 4.\n- Freeway 3: Unsafe at turns 1 and 4.\n- Freeway 4: Unsafe at turns 1 and 4.\n- Freeway 5: Always safe.\n- Freeway 6: Always safe.\n- Freeway 7: Unsafe at turns 12, 13, and 14.\n- Freeway 8: Unsafe at turns 12, 13, and 14.\n\nThe sequence ensures:\n- At turn 4, the player is on \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1, always safe), avoiding the unsafe freeways 2, 3, and 4 at turn 4.\n- The player reaches \\(y = 7\\) at turn 10 and \\(y = 8\\) at turn 11, before the unsafe turns 12–14 for freeways 7 and 8.\n- \\(y = 9\\) is reached at turn 12 with no cars to avoid.\n\nThe action sequence is:\n- Turn 0: Move up to \\(y = 1\\) (safe on freeway 1).\n- Turn 1: Move up to \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2 safe at turn 2).\n- Turn 2: Move down to \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1 safe) to avoid being on freeways 2, 3, or 4 at turn 4.\n- Turn 3: Stay at \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1 safe at turn 4).\n- Turn 4: Move up to \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2 safe at turn 5).\n- Turn 5: Move up to \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3 safe at turn 6).\n- Turn 6: Move up to \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4 safe at turn 7).\n- Turn 7: Move up to \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5 always safe).\n- Turn 8: Move up to \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6 always safe).\n- Turn 9: Move up to \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7 safe at turn 10).\n- Turn 10: Move up to \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8 safe at turn 11).\n- Turn 11: Move up to \\(y = 9\\) (safe, no cars).\n\nThis sequence minimizes \\(H = 12\\) as it is not possible to reach \\(y = 9\\) in fewer turns while avoiding collisions, due to the constraint at turn 4 requiring an extra move (down and stay) to avoid unsafe freeways.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 0: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 1: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,2) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0. The cars move left or right at constant speeds, and I have to avoid being on a freeway when a car spans x=0 at that turn.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car positions over time. The current turn is t_1 = 2, so at turn t, the time elapsed is t - 2 turns.\n\nFor each freeway, there are cars with head, tail, direction, and speed. The direction is given as \"right\" or \"left\", but in the update, for left-moving, the span decreases, and for right-moving, it increases. Let me confirm the notation.\n\nFor left-moving cars: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ]\" and at T, it's [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]. Since it's left-moving, h should be the front, so if it's moving left, decreasing x, so head at smaller x? Let's see the example.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (54, 43, right, 3). Direction right, so it's moving right, so at t_1=2, head is at 54, tail at 43? But if it's moving right, head should be the leading part, so if direction right, head should be at higher x? The span is given as (head, tail), and for right-moving, span becomes [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], which suggests that at initial, head is larger than tail since τ + sΔT to h + sΔT, so head h > tail τ for right-moving.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so if h is head, for left-moving, head should be smaller x, but in the span, it's [h, τ] with h and τ, and after moving left, it decreases, so if h < τ, then [h, τ] moving left to smaller x.\n\nIn the car state table, for freeway 1: (54, 43, right, 3). Direction right, so head 54, tail 43, since 54 > 43, so head at higher x. At time T, position is [43 + 3(T-2), 54 + 3(T-2)]? No.\n\nThe update: for right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nGiven that at t_1, Span(t_1) = [τ, h]? No, in the state, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nBut in the update rule, for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nRight-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed) = (54, 43, right, 3)\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t_1) is [τ, h], so here τ=43, h=54, so [43,54] at t_1=2.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be [h, τ] with h < τ.\n\nBut in this case, all cars are right-moving, I think. Let's check the table.\n\nFreeway 1: (54,43,right,3) — right-moving\n\nFreeway 2: (-24,-35,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (48,37,right,12) — all right-moving\n\nSimilarly freeway 3,4 same as 2? No, freeway 3 is listed the same as 2, but let's see:\n\n\"3 | (-24, -35, right, 12), (12, 1, right, 12), (48, 37, right, 12)\"\n\nSimilarly for 4,5,6,7,8.\n\nFreeway 5: (60,49,right,6)\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5? \"6 | (60, 49, right, 6)\" yes\n\nFreeway 7: (-40,-51,right,4)\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7\n\nAnd freeway 1 is different.\n\nBut freeways 2,3,4 have the same cars? No, freeway 2 has three cars, freeway 3 has the same three, etc. But they are on different freeways, so I need to consider each freeway separately.\n\nFreeway 1: one car\n\nFreeway 2: three cars\n\nFreeway 3: three cars same as freeway 2? But on different y.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 same cars as 2 and 3? The table shows for each freeway the cars, and for k=2,3,4, it's the same set of cars, meaning same configurations but on different y levels.\n\nSimilarly, k=5 and 6 same, k=7 and 8 same.\n\nBut since they are on different y, I need to consider the cars on each y separately.\n\nNow, for each car, I need to find when it occupies x=0, because collision happens only if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, some car has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nThe collision condition: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the row the player is on at turn T.\n\nAlso, note that when you move to a new row, at turn T, you are on y_T, and you will be on y_{T+1} at turn T+1, so at turn T, you are on y_T, so you check cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1)\"\n\nSo, at turn T, you are always on y_T, and you check for cars on that freeway at that turn.\n\nIf you move, at turn T you are on y_T, and at turn T+1 you are on y_{T+1}.\n\nNow, to find a path from y=2 to y=9.\n\nSince the grid is only y=0 to 9, and freeways are y=1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, no cars.\n\nThe player starts at (0,2), which is on freeway y=2? y=2 is a freeway with cars.\n\ny=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9; freeways with cars are y=1 to 8.\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no cars, so safe.\n\nPlayer at (0,2) at turn t_1=2.\n\nWe need to reach (0,9), so y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, we just need to be on y=9 at some turn.\n\nBut we need to minimize turns, so probably go up as fast as possible, but avoiding collisions on the way.\n\nNow, the cars move, so I need to find times when it is safe to be on each freeway.\n\nFor each freeway and each turn, I can compute if there is a car covering x=0 at that turn.\n\nIf not, then it's safe to be on that freeway at that turn.\n\nSince the cars move continuously in x, but we only care about discrete turns.\n\nt is integer, I assume.\n\nNow, current turn t_1=2.\n\nLet Δt = t - 2, so at turn t, time since start.\n\nFor a car on freeway i, at time t, the span for a right-moving car is [τ + s(t-2), h + s(t-2)] where (h,τ) are from the state.\n\nIn the state, for right-moving, at t_1=2, span is [τ, h] as per update rule.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: car (head=54, tail=43, right, speed=3)\n\nSince right-moving, at t_1=2, span is [τ, h] = [43, 54]\n\nAt time t, span is [43 + 3(t-2), 54 + 3(t-2)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, it would be different, but all cars here are right-moving.\n\nNow, 0 is in span if 43 + 3(t-2) ≤ 0 ≤ 54 + 3(t-2)\n\nSimilarly for other cars.\n\nBut since the span might be large, or multiple cars.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway the cars and their span functions.\n\nStart with freeway 1: y=1\n\nCar: at t, span [43 + 3(t-2), 54 + 3(t-2)]\n\n0 in span: lower ≤ 0 ≤ upper\n\n43 + 3(t-2) ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 54 + 3(t-2)\n\nBut 43 + 3(t-2) ≤ 0 implies 3(t-2) ≤ -43, t-2 ≤ -43/3 ≈ -14.333, so t ≤ 2 - 14.333 = negative, impossible since t≥2? t starts from 2, but at t=2, 43 +0 =43 >0, so lower bound 43>0, so 0 < lower, so 0 not in span, similarly upper is 54>0, but since lower>0, 0 < lower ≤ x ≤ upper, so 0 not in [lower,upper] since lower>0.\n\nAt t=2, [43,54], 0 not in.\n\nAs t increases, lower and upper increase, so always positive, never covers 0. So for freeway 1, at all times, no car covers x=0. So it's always safe to be on y=1.\n\nIs that right?\n\n43 + 3(t-2) for t≥2, min at t=2 is 43, which is >0, and increases, so yes, x=0 is always left of the car, never covered. So freeway y=1 is always safe.\n\nNow freeway 2: y=2\n\nThree cars:\n\n1. (-24, -35, right, 12) — head=-24? tail=-35? Since right-moving, span at t_1=2 is [τ, h] = [-35, -24]\n\nAt t, [-35 + 12(t-2), -24 + 12(t-2)]\n\n2. (12, 1, right, 12) — span at t_1=2: [τ, h] = [1,12]\n\nAt t, [1 + 12(t-2), 12 + 12(t-2)]\n\n3. (48, 37, right, 12) — [37,48] at t_1=2, at t [37 + 12(t-2), 48 + 12(t-2)]\n\nNow, 0 in span for any car.\n\nFirst car: [-35 + 12(t-2), -24 + 12(t-2)]\n\n0 in this if -35 + 12(t-2) ≤ 0 ≤ -24 + 12(t-2)\n\nWhich is -35 + 12(t-2) ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ -24 + 12(t-2)\n\nFirst inequality: -35 + 12(t-2) ≤ 0 => 12(t-2) ≤ 35 => t-2 ≤ 35/12 ≈ 2.9167 => t ≤ 4.9167\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -24 + 12(t-2) => 24 ≤ 12(t-2) => 2 ≤ t-2 => t ≥ 4\n\nSo for t from 4 to 4.9167, i.e., t=4, and t=5? t integer, so t=4: check\n\nAt t=4, Δt=2, lower = -35 + 12*2 = -35+24= -11 ≤0\n\nUpper = -24 +24=0 ≤0, so 0≤0, yes, 0 in [-11,0]? -11 to 0, 0 included, yes.\n\nAt t=5, Δt=3, lower= -35+36=1, upper= -24+36=12, 1 to 12, 0 not in.\n\nt=4: lower=-35+12*2= -35+24=-11, upper=-24+24=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nt=5: lower=-35+36=1, upper=-24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nt=3: Δt=1, lower=-35+12= -23, upper=-24+12= -12, [-23,-12], all negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo only at t=4, for first car, 0 is covered? At t=4, span is [-11,0], so x=0 is covered.\n\nNow second car: [1 + 12(t-2), 12 + 12(t-2)]\n\nAt t=2: [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nAs t increases, lower and upper increase, min lower at t=2 is 1>0, so always positive, never covers 0.\n\nThird car: [37 + 12(t-2), 48 + 12(t-2)], min at t=2 is 37>0, always positive, never covers 0.\n\nSo for freeway 2, only the first car covers x=0 at t=4.\n\nSpecifically, at t=4, 0 in span.\n\nAt other times, no car covers x=0.\n\nt=4 is the only time when unsafe on y=2.\n\nNow freeway 3: y=3, same cars as freeway 2? The table says for freeway 3: same as freeway 2, three cars with same parameters.\n\nSo similarly, only at t=4, the first car covers x=0, so unsafe at t=4.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 4: y=4, same, unsafe only at t=4.\n\nNow freeway 5: y=5\n\nCar: (60,49,right,6) so span at t_1=2: [τ,h] = [49,60]? head=60, tail=49, so [49,60] at t=2.\n\nAt t, [49 + 6(t-2), 60 + 6(t-2)]\n\nMin lower at t=2 is 49>0, always positive, never covers 0. So always safe.\n\nSimilarly freeway 6: y=6, same car, always safe.\n\nNow freeway 7: y=7\n\nCar: (-40,-51,right,4) head=-40, tail=-51, right-moving.\n\nSpan at t_1=2: [τ,h] = [-51,-40]\n\nAt t, [-51 + 4(t-2), -40 + 4(t-2)]\n\n0 in span if -51 + 4(t-2) ≤ 0 ≤ -40 + 4(t-2)\n\nFirst inequality: -51 + 4(t-2) ≤ 0 => 4(t-2) ≤ 51 => t-2 ≤ 51/4 = 12.75 => t ≤ 14.75\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -40 + 4(t-2) => 40 ≤ 4(t-2) => 10 ≤ t-2 => t ≥ 12\n\nSo for t from 12 to 14.75, i.e., t=12,13,14.\n\nAt t=12: Δt=10, lower= -51 + 4*10 = -51+40= -11 ≤0, upper= -40+40=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nt=13: Δt=11, lower= -51+44= -7, upper= -40+44=4, [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nt=14: Δt=12, lower= -51+48= -3, upper= -40+48=8, [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nt=15: Δt=13, lower= -51+52=1, upper= -40+52=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe on y=7 at t=12,13,14.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 8: y=8, same car, unsafe at t=12,13,14.\n\nNow, summarize safe times for each freeway:\n\ny=1: always safe\n\ny=2: unsafe at t=4, safe otherwise\n\ny=3: unsafe at t=4, safe otherwise (since same as y=2)\n\ny=4: unsafe at t=4, safe otherwise\n\ny=5: always safe\n\ny=6: always safe\n\ny=7: unsafe at t=12,13,14; safe otherwise\n\ny=8: unsafe at t=12,13,14; safe otherwise\n\ny=0 and y=9: no cars, always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at y=2 at t=2.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nActions: U (up), D (down), S (stay)\n\nEach action changes y by +1, -1, 0.\n\ny must be between 0 and 9.\n\nWe start at t=2, y=2.\n\nWe need to get to y=9 asap.\n\nThe minimal H would be at least 7, since from y=2 to y=9, difference 7, so if we go up every turn, 7 turns to reach y=9 at t=9.\n\nBut we need to check if we can do that without collision.\n\nNow, at each turn, we are on a certain y, and we need that at that turn, y is safe.\n\nFor example, if we go straight up:\n\nt=2: y=2, safe? At t=2, y=2 is safe, since unsafe only at t=4.\n\nt=2: y=2, we are on it, and safe.\n\nThen action: suppose we do U, to y=3 at t=3.\n\nt=3: y=3, is it safe? y=3 unsafe only at t=4, so at t=3, safe.\n\nDo U to y=4 at t=4.\n\nt=4: y=4, but at t=4, y=4 is unsafe! Because freeway 4 unsafe at t=4.\n\nCollision.\n\nIf we do U at t=2 to y=3 at t=3.\n\nt=3: y=3 safe.\n\nThen at t=3, if we do U to y=4 at t=4.\n\nt=4: y=4, unsafe.\n\nIf at t=3 we do S, stay at y=3.\n\nt=3: y=3 safe.\n\nThen at t=4, if we are on y=3, and t=4, unsafe for y=3.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=4 at t=4, unsafe.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=2,3,4 at t=4.\n\ny=2,3,4 all unsafe at t=4.\n\ny=1,5,6 safe at t=4.\n\nBut we start at y=2, t=2.\n\nt=2: y=2 safe.\n\nWe need to be not on y=2,3,4 at t=4.\n\nOptions:\n\n- Move up to y=3 at t=3, but then at t=3 we are on y=3, which is safe since only unsafe at t=4.\n\nThen at t=3, we need to go to a safe row for t=4.\n\nSafe rows at t=4: y=1,5,6,0,9, etc.\n\nBut we can move to y=4? But y=4 unsafe at t=4.\n\nFrom y=3, actions: U to y=4, D to y=2, or S to y=3.\n\nBut at t=4, all these are unsafe: y=2,3,4 all unsafe.\n\nIf we go to y=1 or y=5, but from y=3, we can only go to y=2,3,4 in one step.\n\nWe cannot jump to y=1 or y=5 directly; only adjacent y changes.\n\ny changes by at most 1 per turn.\n\nSo from y=3 at t=3, possible y at t=4: 2,3,4 all unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=3 at t=3, because whatever we do, at t=4 we will be on an unsafe row.\n\nSimilarly, if we stay at y=2 at t=3.\n\nt=2: start, we can choose action.\n\nAt t=2, y=2.\n\nWe can do:\n\n- U: to y=3 at t=3\n\n- D: to y=1 at t=3\n\n- S: stay at y=2 at t=3\n\nNow, at t=3, if we are on y=2 or y=3, then at t=4 we are stuck with unsafe rows.\n\nBut if at t=2 we go down to y=1 at t=3.\n\ny=1 is always safe.\n\nt=3: on y=1, safe.\n\nThen at t=3, we can choose action for t=4.\n\nt=4: safe rows are y=1,5,6,0,9,7? y=7 unsafe at t=12-14, but t=4 is early, so safe.\n\ny=7 unsafe only at t=12-14, so at t=4 safe.\n\nSimilarly all except y=2,3,4.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=3, we can go to y=0, y=1, or y=2.\n\nBut y=2 at t=4 is unsafe.\n\ny=0 is safe, y=1 safe.\n\nSo we can go to y=0 or y=1 at t=4.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\ny=0 is safe, but it's at the bottom.\n\nWe could go to y=5 or something, but from y=1, we can only go to y=0,1,2.\n\nCannot go directly to y=5.\n\nWe need to wait or something.\n\nSince y=5 and y=6 are always safe, we can go there.\n\nBut we start from y=2.\n\nAt t=2, y=2.\n\nInstead of going down, we might stay or go up, but we saw going up to y=3 at t=3 leads to problem.\n\nAt t=2, go down to y=1 at t=3.\n\nt=3: y=1, safe.\n\nThen at t=3, we can go up to y=2? But at t=4, y=2 unsafe, so not good.\n\nGo to y=0: down to y=0 at t=4.\n\nt=4: y=0, safe, no cars.\n\nThen from there, we can go up.\n\nBut y=0 to y=9, 9 steps, but we lost time.\n\nSince we need to avoid t=4 on rows 2-4.\n\nt=4 is the only critical point early on.\n\nLater t=12-14 for y=7,8, but that might be far.\n\nMinimal H is 7, but we cannot achieve in 7 turns because of t=4.\n\nWith detour, H will be larger.\n\nWe need to be not on y=2,3,4 at turn t=4.\n\nAt t=4, we should be on y=1, or y=5, or y=0, etc.\n\nBut from start, we are at y=2 t=2.\n\nIf we go down to y=1 at t=3, then at t=3 y=1.\n\nNow from y=1, to reach y=5, for example, but we need to go through y=2,3,4, but at t=4, those are unsafe.\n\nAt t=4, if we could be on y=5, but from y=1 at t=3, we can only be at y=0,1,2 at t=4.\n\nNone is y=5.\n\nSo impossible to be on y=5 at t=4 from start in 2 steps? From t=2 to t=4 is 2 turns.\n\nAt t=2, y=2.\n\nAfter one action: t=3, y=1,2, or3.\n\nAfter second action: t=4, y from min y=0 (if from y=1 down) to max y=4 (if from y=3 up).\n\nSo y at t=4 can be 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nBut y=2,3,4 unsafe, y=0 and y=1 safe.\n\nSo we can be at y=0 or y=1 at t=4.\n\nThen from there, we can proceed up.\n\nBut to reach y=9, it will take more turns.\n\nFor example, at t=4, y=1 (safe).\n\nThen we can go up to y=2 at t=5.\n\nt=5: y=2, is it safe? Earlier, y=2 unsafe only at t=4, so at t=5 safe.\n\nSimilarly, go to y=3 at t=6, safe.\n\ny=4 at t=7, safe.\n\nThen to y=5 at t=8, safe.\n\ny=6 at t=9, safe.\n\nThen to y=7 at t=10.\n\nBut y=7 unsafe at t=12,13,14, but t=10 is before, so safe? t=10 <12, so safe.\n\ny=7 unsafe only t=12,13,14.\n\nt=10: safe.\n\nGo to y=8 at t=11.\n\nt=11: y=8, unsafe only t=12,13,14, t=11<12, safe.\n\nThen to y=9 at t=12.\n\nt=12: if we go to y=9 at t=12, but at t=12, we are on y=9? Let's see.\n\nAt t=11, we are on y=8.\n\nAction at t=11: if we do U, to y=9 at t=12.\n\nAt turn t=12, player position y_{12} =9.\n\nNow, is there collision? Collision only if on freeway y=9, but y=9 has no cars, so safe.\n\nBut at t=12, we are on y=9, which is safe.\n\nWe need to check if during the path we are safe.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nStart t=2, y=2.\n\nTo avoid t=4 on unsafe rows, we go down to y=1 at t=3.\n\nt=2: action D? D is down, so from y=2 to y=1.\n\nt=2: y=2, action D, so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, Δy = -1 for D.\n\nSo at turn t, after action, position for next turn.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t, player is at position (0, y_t)\n\nThen we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nThen at turn t+1, player is at (0, y_{t+1})\n\nCollision at turn T if when at position (0, y_T), and y_T is freeway (1-8), and 0 in span of some car on y_T at turn T.\n\nIn this case, at turn T, we are on y_T.\n\nNow for the sequence:\n\nt=2: player at y=2. We choose action.\n\nSuppose we choose a_{t_1} = a_2 = D, so down to y=1 at next turn.\n\nAfter action a_2, y_{3} = y_2 + (-1) = 1\n\nNow at turn t=3: player at y=3? No.\n\nAt turn t=2: position y_2=2\n\nAfter action a_2, y_{3} =1\n\nThen at turn t=3: player position is y_3=1\n\nNow we check collision at t=3: on y=1, which is freeway 1, always safe, no collision.\n\nThen at t=3, we choose action. We want to be safe at t=4.\n\nAt t=4, we need y_4 such that it is safe.\n\ny_4=0 or y_4=1, since y=2,3,4 unsafe.\n\nFrom y_3=1, actions:\n\n- U: to y=2, so y_4=2\n\n- D: to y=0, y_4=0\n\n- S: to y=1, y_4=1\n\ny_4=2 unsafe, so we cannot choose U.\n\nWe can choose D or S.\n\nIf S, y_4=1, safe.\n\nIf D, y_4=0, also safe.\n\nSay we choose S, stay at t=3, so a_3=S, then y_4=1\n\nAt turn t=4: y=1, safe.\n\nThen we can start going up.\n\nAt t=4, y=1, choose action U, so a_4=U, then y_5=2\n\nt=5: y=2, now is it safe? y=2 unsafe only at t=4, t=5>4, safe.\n\nThen a_5=U, to y=3 at t=6\n\nt=6: y=3, safe (unsafe only t=4)\n\na_6=U, to y=4 at t=7\n\nt=7: y=4, safe (unsafe only t=4)\n\na_7=U, to y=5 at t=8\n\nt=8: y=5, always safe\n\na_8=U, to y=6 at t=9\n\nt=9: y=6, safe\n\na_9=U, to y=7 at t=10\n\nt=10: y=7, unsafe at t=12,13,14; t=10<12, safe\n\na_10=U, to y=8 at t=11\n\nt=11: y=8, unsafe at t=12,13,14; t=11<12, safe\n\na_11=U, to y=9 at t=12\n\nt=12: y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nNow, we reached y=9 at t=12.\n\nNumber of turns: from t=2 to t=12, we used actions from t=2 to t=11, H=10 actions? Let's see.\n\nWe started at t=2 with position.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H -1? Let's see the definition.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nIn this case, t_1=2, we want y_{2 + H -1} =9\n\nAt t=12, y=9, so 2 + H -1 =12, so 1 + H =12, H=11.\n\nActions: we applied actions at t=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11? That's 10 actions.\n\nt from 2 to 11 inclusive: 10 turns? Turns are discrete.\n\nList the turns:\n\n- At turn t=2: position y=2\n\n- After a_2: to y=1 at t=3\n\n- At t=3: y=1\n\n- After a_3: say S, to y=1 at t=4? If a_3=S, y_{t+1} = y_t, so from t=3, a_3=S, y_4 = y_3 =1\n\nBetter to list per turn.\n\nTurn t: position y_t, then action a_t, then next position y_{t+1}\n\nWe reach when y_t =9 for some t.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nt=2: y=2, action a_2 = D (down to y=1)\n\nt=3: y=1, action a_3 = S (stay, so y=1 next)\n\nt=4: y=1, action a_4 = U (up to y=2)\n\nt=5: y=2, action a_5 = U (to y=3)\n\nt=6: y=3, action a_6 = U (to y=4)\n\nt=7: y=4, action a_7 = U (to y=5)\n\nt=8: y=5, action a_8 = U (to y=6)\n\nt=9: y=6, action a_9 = U (to y=7)\n\nt=10: y=7, action a_10 = U (to y=8)\n\nt=11: y=8, action a_11 = U (to y=9)\n\nt=12: y=9, done.\n\nWe reached y=9 at t=12.\n\nThe actions were applied from t=2 to t=11, that is, H=10 actions.\n\nt from t_1=2 to t_1 + H -1 =2 + H -1 = t where y=9.\n\ny_{2+H-1} =9, and at t=12, so 2+H-1=12, H-1=10, H=11.\n\n2 + H -1 =12, so H+1=12, H=11.\n\nActions: {a_t for t=2 to t=11}, 10 actions? t from 2 to 11 inclusive is 10 values: t=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, so sequence has H actions.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{2 + H -1} =9\n\nSet 2 + H -1 =12, so H-1=10, H=11.\n\nThe sequence is a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, so a_2 to a_{2+11-1} = a_2 to a_{12}? No.\n\nt_1 + H -1 is the turn when we reach, so actions from t=t_1 to t=t_1 + H -2? Let's see.\n\nStandard: we start at turn t_1, after 0 actions, at position.\n\nAfter first action, at turn t_1+1, and so on, after k actions, at turn t_1 + k.\n\nWe want at turn T, y_T=9, with T = t_1 + H -1.\n\nNumber of actions H, then T = t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn this case, T=12, t_1=2, so 2 + H -1 =12, H=11.\n\nActions at t = t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H -1 = t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =12, t_1=2, so H-1=10, H=11, actions at t=2 to t=11.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the sequence above, we have actions from t=2 to t=11, 11 actions? t=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11: that's 10 actions? Let's count: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11: 10 values.\n\nt from 2 to 11 inclusive: number of integers: 11-2+1=10.\n\nBut H=11, actions from t=2 to t=12? No.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =12, actions from t=t_1 to t=t_1 + H -1? t_1 + H -1 =12, so t=2 to 12? But at t=12, we don't need action if we are already at y=9.\n\nI think I confused.\n\nAt turn t, we are at position, then we choose action a_t to go to next position at t+1.\n\nSo to reach position at turn T, we need actions from t=t_1 to t=T-1.\n\nIn this case, to be at y=9 at turn T=12, we need actions from t=2 to t=11.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=2 to t=11, that's 10 actions? t=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11: 10 actions.\n\nBut H should be such that after H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H.\n\nPerhaps the turn index.\n\nDefine: at turn t_1, position given.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, we go to turn t_1+1 with new position.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + k} for k=0 to H-1, we reach position at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut we want to reach (0,9) at some turn, which is turn t_1 + H -1? The problem says:\n\n\"reach (0,9)\" and \"y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nSo at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nThe actions are from t= t_1 to t= t_1 + H -2? Let's see the sequence index.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1\n\nSo for t=0, a_{t_1 +0} = a_{t_1}\n\nt=1, a_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nt=H-1, a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nThen after these H actions, at turn (t_1 + (H-1)) +1 = t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, so the position at turn t_1 + H -1 is 9, which is before the last action or after?\n\nInconsistency.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think that after applying a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, the position at turn t_1 + H is set, but we want position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nThe actions are applied at times t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H -1.\n\nAfter applying a_{t_1}, at turn t_1+1, position y_{t_1+1}\n\nAfter applying a_{t_1 + k} at turn t_1 + k, we go to position at turn t_1 + k +1.\n\nSo after applying the last action a_{t_1 + H -1} at turn t_1 + H -1, we go to position at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut we want the position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, before applying action, position is y_{t_1 + H -1}, and we want this to be 9.\n\nThen we apply action a_{t_1 + H -1}, which may change it, but we don't care, as long as at that turn it is 9.\n\nThe collision is checked at each turn when we are on that position.\n\nFor the sequence, we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn the action sequence, for each action a_t applied at turn t, it affects the next position.\n\nBut at turn t, we are at y_t, then apply a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nFor turn t_1 + H -1, we are at y_{t_1 + H -1}, and we want this to be 9.\n\nThe actions up to a_{t_1 + H -2} determine y_{t_1 + H -1}, and a_{t_1 + H -1} is applied at that turn to go to y_{t_1 + H}, but since we reached at t_1 + H -1, we may not need to specify a_{t_1 + H -1} if we are already at 9, but we can choose S or something.\n\nIn the sequence, we include a_{t_1 + H -1} as well, I think.\n\nBut in the answer format, we list actions until we reach.\n\nIn my earlier sequence, at t=12, y=9, so for t_1=2, t=12, so t_1 + H -1 =12, so 2 + H -1 =12, H-1=10, H=11.\n\nThen actions from t=2 to t=11, which is a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1} = a_2 to a_{12}? t_1 + H -1 =2+11-1=12.\n\nActions at t= t_1 to t_1 + H -1 =2 to 12.\n\nBut at t=12, if we are at y=9, we might not need to move, but we can apply a_{12}, which could be S or U, but y=9, U would not change, since y=9 max, so y_{13}=9 if U or S, or D to 8, but we want to be at 9 at t=12.\n\nThe position at t=12 is y=9, so for the action at t=12, it doesn't affect the position at t=12, only at t=13.\n\nBut since we care about position at t=12, the action at t=12 is not necessary for reaching, but the sequence includes it up to H-1.\n\nIn the sequence, for t from 0 to H-1, a_{t_1 + t}, so for t=0, a_{t_1}, t=1, a_{t_1+1}, ..., t=H-1, a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nThen after these, at turn t_1 + H, position.\n\nBut we want position at t_1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nSo to have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, the actions a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -2} determine y_{t_1 + H -1}, and a_{t_1 + H -1} is applied at turn t_1 + H -1 to go to next, but it doesn't affect y_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nIn the sequence, we include a_{t_1 + H -1} as well, which can be chosen arbitrarily since it doesn't affect the reaching at t_1 + H -1.\n\nBut for safety, at turn t_1 + H -1, when we are at y=9, it is safe, no issue.\n\nIn my sequence, at t=12, y=9, so t_1 + H -1 =12, t_1=2, so H-1=10, H=11.\n\nActions from t=2 to t=11: a2 to a11.\n\nAt t=12, we are at y=9, so for action a12, it is not needed, but in the sequence up to a_{t_1 + H -1} = a_{12}, but H=11, t_1 + H -1 =2+11-1=12, so a12 is included.\n\nBut at t=12, we are already at y=9, so a12 can be S, for example.\n\nSimilarly, in the path, we have actions from t=2 to t=11 to reach y=9 at t=12.\n\nNumber of actions H=11.\n\nBut in terms of turns from start, we used 10 actions to go from t=2 to t=12, but t=2 to t=12 is 11 turns? Turns: t=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12: 11 turns, but at t=2 we start, after 0 actions, then after 1 action at t=2, at t=3, and so on, after 10 actions at t=12.\n\nFrom t=2 to t=12, there are 10 intervals, 10 actions.\n\nBut position at t=2 is given, after 10 actions, position at t=12.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the sequence, actions a2 to a11 for 10 actions? a2 to a11 is t=2 to t=11, that's 10 actions, leading to position at t=12.\n\ny_{12} =9.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{2 + H -1} =9.\n\nSet 2 + H -1 =12, so H-1=10, H=11.\n\nThen the actions are for t=0 to H-1 of the sequence index, so a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to 10, since H-1=10.\n\nt from 0 to 10, that's 11 values: a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + 10} = a2 to a12.\n\nAt t=12, we apply a12, but position at t=12 is already 9, so a12 can be S.\n\nIn the collision, at turn t=12, we are at y=9, safe, no issue.\n\nBut in the sequence, for the path to reach, a12 is not necessary, but it is included in the sequence.\n\nTo avoid confusion, in my sequence, I can set at t=11, we go to y=9 at t=12, so a11=U from y=8 to y=9.\n\nThen at t=12, y=9, we can have a12=S, but since we reached at t=12, and H=11, the sequence includes a2 to a12, but a12 is after reaching.\n\nPerhaps it's fine.\n\nFor the path, we can stop at a11.\n\nBut let's see the minimal H.\n\nIn this path, we used 10 actions to go from t=2 to t=12, with H=11 for the definition.\n\nBut we might do better.\n\nFor example, at t=4, instead of being at y=1, we could be at y=5 or something, but we can't reach directly.\n\nAnother idea: since y=5 and y=6 are always safe, we can go there directly, but from y=2, we need to go through y=3 and y=4, but at t=4, it is unsafe.\n\nBut t=4 is only one turn.\n\nWe can delay or advance the movement.\n\nFor example, at t=2, go up to y=3 at t=3.\n\nt=3: y=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=3, instead of going up, go down to y=2 at t=4, but y=2 at t=4 unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nOr at t=3, stay, y=3 at t=4 unsafe.\n\nNo, from y=3 at t=3, we must go to y=2,3, or4 at t=4, all unsafe.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=3 at t=3.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=2, stay at y=2 at t=3, then at t=3 y=2, then at t=3, go to y=1,2, or3 at t=4.\n\ny=1 safe, y=2 and3 unsafe.\n\nSo we can go down to y=1 at t=4.\n\nBut at t=4, y=1 safe.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nWe could go up to y=3 at t=3, but then we are stuck for t=4.\n\nUnless we can skip t=4 on the critical rows, but we can't.\n\nAnother possibility: go down to y=1 at t=3, then at t=3, go up to y=2? But at t=4, y=2 unsafe, so not.\n\nSo the only safe choices at t=4 are y=0 or y=1.\n\nThen from there, we go up.\n\nBut y=1 to y=9, 8 steps, from t=4 to t=12, 8 actions? From t=4 y=1 to t=12 y=9, 8 steps: y=1 to2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, 8 actions, from t=4 to t=11 actions, to reach at t=12.\n\nBut we started from t=2.\n\nIn the sequence with down at t=2 to y=1 at t=3, then stay or down at t=3 to y=1 or y=0 at t=4.\n\nIf we go to y=1 at t=4, then from t=4 y=1 to t=12 y=9, that's 8 actions: a4 to a11.\n\nBut we have actions before: a2 and a3.\n\nIn total, actions a2 to a11, 10 actions, H=11.\n\nIf at t=3 we go down to y=0 at t=4.\n\nt=4: y=0, safe.\n\nThen from y=0, we can go up faster, but y=0 to y=1, etc., same as before, but y=0 to y=1 at t=5, then to y=2 at t=6, and so on, to y=9 at t=13 or later, worse.\n\nFor example: t=4 y=0, a4=U to y=1 t=5\n\nt=5 y=1, a5=U to y=2 t=6\n\nt=6 y=2 safe (t=6>4), a6=U to y=3 t=7\n\nt=7 y=3 safe, a7=U to y=4 t=8\n\nt=8 y=4 safe, a8=U to y=5 t=9\n\netc., to y=9 at t=13, later.\n\nSo worse.\n\nThus the first path is better: be at y=1 at t=4, then go up directly.\n\nBut in that path, we have to pass y=7 and y=8 before t=12, since unsafe at t=12,13,14.\n\nIn my sequence, we are at y=7 at t=10, y=8 at t=11, y=9 at t=12, all before t=12, so t=10,11 <12, safe.\n\nt=12 we are at y=9.\n\nBut at t=12, y=9 safe.\n\nNow, can we reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if we can be higher at t=4.\n\nBut we cannot.\n\nPerhaps go up to y=4 at t=3, but t=3 y=4? From t=2 y=2, a2=U to y=3 at t=3.\n\nThen at t=3, y=3, cannot go to y=4 at t=4 because unsafe.\n\nUnless we go to y=5 directly, but impossible.\n\nAnother idea: since y=5 is always safe, if we can reach y=5 earlier.\n\nBut from y=2, min time to y=5 is 3 steps: to y=3 at t=3, y=4 at t=4, but t=4 y=4 unsafe, or to y=5 at t=5: from y=2 at t=2, U to y=3 t=3, U to y=4 t=4, but t=4 y=4 unsafe, collision.\n\nIf we go faster, but we can only move one step per turn.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=5 before t=5, and at t=5, y=5 safe, but to be at y=5 at t=5, we need to be at y=4 at t=4 or something.\n\nTo be at y=5 at t=5: at t=4, we must be at y=4 or y=5 or y=6, but from below, y=4.\n\nBut at t=4, y=4 unsafe.\n\nIf we are at y=5 at t=4, but how? From y=2 at t=2, to y=5 at t=4: impossible in two steps, max to y=4.\n\ny=4 at t=4 unsafe.\n\nSo cannot be at y=5 at t=4.\n\nEarliest at y=5 is t=5: for example, from y=2 at t=2, but we need to avoid y=4 at t=4.\n\nSo from start, go down to y=1 at t=3, then at t=3, go up to y=2? But at t=4, y=2 unsafe if we go to y=2.\n\nFrom y=1 at t=3, if we go up to y=2 at t=4, unsafe.\n\nIf we go to y=1 or y=0 at t=4, safe, but then at t=4 y=1, then to y=2 at t=5, y=3 at t=6, y=4 at t=7, y=5 at t=8, later than before.\n\nIn my first path, at t=4 y=1, then t=5 y=2, t=6 y=3, t=7 y=4, t=8 y=5, t=9 y=6, t=10 y=7, t=11 y=8, t=12 y=9.\n\nAt t=8 y=5, which is later than t=5.\n\nBut we cannot reach y=5 at t=5 because of the t=4 issue.\n\nUnless we do something else.\n\nPerhaps stay at low y until after t=4.\n\nBut we need to go up.\n\nSince y=7 and y=8 have unsafe times later, but we can pass them before t=12.\n\nIn the current path, we pass at t=10 and t=11, which is fine.\n\nBut can we reach y=9 before t=12?\n\nFor example, if we can be at higher y at start.\n\nStart at y=2.\n\nMinimal turns to y=9 is 7, to be at y=9 at t=9.\n\nBut to be at y=9 at t=9, we need to be at y=8 at t=8, y=7 at t=7, etc.\n\nBut at t=4, we need to be on y=4 or something.\n\nSpecifically, to be at y=4 at t=4 for the direct path, but unsafe.\n\nOther paths: for example, from y=2 at t=2, go up to y=3 at t=3, then at t=3, go down to y=2 at t=4, unsafe.\n\nOr go to y=4 at t=4, unsafe.\n\nNo.\n\nGo down to y=1 at t=3, then at t=3, go down to y=0 at t=4.\n\nThen at t=4 y=0, then go up: a4=U to y=1 t=5, a5=U to y=2 t=6, a6=U to y=3 t=7, a7=U to y=4 t=8, a8=U to y=5 t=9, a9=U to y=6 t=10, a10=U to y=7 t=11, a11=U to y=8 t=12, a12=U to y=9 t=13? Then later.\n\nWorse.\n\nFrom y=0 at t=4, but we can go faster? No, same.\n\nSo the first path with y=1 at t=4 is better.\n\nBut in that path, at t=10 y=7 and t=11 y=8, which are before unsafe times.\n\nNow, can we reduce the time by not staying at y=1 at t=4?\n\nIn the first path, at t=3, we did S to stay at y=1 for t=4.\n\nBut we could go down to y=0 at t=4, but that delays.\n\nOr, from y=1 at t=3, we go up to y=2 at t=4, but unsafe, not possible.\n\nSo must stay or go down at t=3.\n\nThus, minimal H is 11 for this path.\n\nBut let's confirm the sequence.\n\nt_1=2\n\nActions:\n\nAt t=2: action D, to y=1 at t=3\n\nAt t=3: action S, to y=1 at t=4? a3=S, y4 = y3 +0 =1\n\nThen at t=4: action U, to y=2 at t=5\n\nt=5: action U, to y=3 at t=6\n\nt=6: action U, to y=4 at t=7\n\nt=7: action U, to y=5 at t=8\n\nt=8: action U, to y=6 at t=9\n\nt=9: action U, to y=7 at t=10\n\nt=10: action U, to y=8 at t=11\n\nt=11: action U, to y=9 at t=12\n\nNow, we are at y=9 at t=12.\n\nThe actions are a2 to a11.\n\nFor the sequence, {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}\n\nt_1 + H -1 =12, so H-1=10, H=11.\n\nt from 0 to 10: a_{2+0} to a_{2+10} = a2 to a12.\n\nBut in above, we have a2 to a11.\n\na11 is at t=11, which goes to y=12? No.\n\nAt t=11, we apply a11, from y=8 to y=9 at t=12.\n\nThen at t=12, we are at y=9.\n\nTo have y_{12}=9, we need actions up to a11.\n\nFor a12, if we include, we can set a12=S, for example.\n\nIn the sequence, since we reached at t=12, a12 can be anything, but we need to specify.\n\nIn the answer, we list actions until we reach, but the sequence should include all actions for the turns until the reaching turn.\n\nTo be precise, for H=11, actions a2 to a12, with a12 applied at t=12 when y=9.\n\nBut at t=12, y=9, so a12 can be S.\n\nIn the collision, at t=12, we are on y=9, safe.\n\nSimilarly, for the path, no issue.\n\nWe can have H smaller by not staying at y=1.\n\nAnother idea: at t=2, instead of going down, go up to y=3 at t=3.\n\nThen at t=3, y=3, safe.\n\nNow, we cannot stay or move to safe row for t=4, but what if we move to a row that is safe at t=4, but from y=3, we can only go to y=2,3,4, all unsafe at t=4.\n\nUnless we can be on a different row, but impossible.\n\nPerhaps the cars move, and at some turns it might be safe, but in this case, only t=4 is unsafe for y=2,3,4.\n\nNo other times.\n\nSo I think the detour is necessary.\n\nBut in the detour, we used 10 actions to go from y=2 to y=9, but with initial position, from t=2 to t=12, 10 actions.\n\nMinimal is 7, but not achievable.\n\nPerhaps we can go directly after t=4.\n\nFor example, at t=2, stay at y=2 for t=3.\n\nt=2: a2=S, to y=2 at t=3\n\nThen at t=3, y=2, now we can go down to y=1 at t=4.\n\na3=D, to y=1 at t=4\n\nt=4: y=1, safe.\n\nThen same as before: a4=U to y=2 t=5, etc.\n\nSimilar to first path, but we stayed at y=2 for one extra turn, but in this case, at t=3 y=2, which is safe, since unsafe only t=4.\n\nThen at t=4, we go to y=1, safe.\n\nThen from t=4 y=1, same as before.\n\nBut in this case, we reached y=9 at same t=12.\n\nActions: a2=S, a3=D, a4=U, ..., same as before but a2=S instead of D.\n\nIn first path a2=D, here a2=S, a3=D.\n\nThen from t=4 same.\n\nBut number of actions same.\n\nWith a2=S, we stayed at y=2 for t=3, then down to y=1 at t=4.\n\nt=3 y=2 safe, t=4 y=1 safe.\n\nThen proceed up.\n\nSame H.\n\nBut we can go up faster from there? No.\n\nNow, about the later part, y=7 and y=8 unsafe at t=12,13,14.\n\nIn the path, we are at y=7 t=10, y=8 t=11, both before t=12, so safe.\n\nBut can we be at y=9 earlier than t=12?\n\nFor example, if we start from y=2 at t=2, and go directly, but stuck at t=4.\n\nAfter t=4, from y=1 at t=4, we go to y=2 at t=5, but y=2 to y=3 at t=6, etc., up to y=9 at t=12, as before.\n\nIf we could be at y=4 at t=5, for example.\n\nBut to be at y=4 at t=5: from y=1 at t=4, we can go to y=2 at t=5, not y=4.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let's list the sequence for the first plan.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn t_1 =2: action a2 = D  (down to y=1)\n\nTurn t_1+1=3: action a3 = S  (stay at y=1)\n\nTurn t_1+2=4: action a4 = U  (up to y=2)\n\nTurn t_1+3=5: action a5 = U  (up to y=3)\n\nTurn t_1+4=6: action a6 = U  (up to y=4)\n\nTurn t_1+5=7: action a7 = U  (up to y=5)\n\nTurn t_1+6=8: action a8 = U  (up to y=6)\n\nTurn t_1+7=9: action a9 = U  (up to y=7)\n\nTurn t_1+8=10: action a10 = U  (up to y=8)\n\nTurn t_1+9=11: action a11 = U  (up to y=9)\n\nThen at turn t_1 +10 =12, y=9.\n\nNow, H=11, since y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{2+11-1}=y12=9.\n\nActions from t=0 to H-1=10 for the sequence index: a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to 10.\n\nt=0: a2\n\nt=1: a3\n\nt=2: a4\n\n...\n\nt=10: a12? t_1 + t for t=10 is 2+10=12, a12.\n\nBut in above, we have up to a11.\n\na11 is at t=11, which is t_1 +9.\n\nFor H=11, t from 0 to 10, a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to 10: a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9, a10, a11, a12.\n\na2 to a12, that's 11 actions.\n\nAt t=12, we need a12.\n\nIn the path, at t=12, we are at y=9, so we can set a12 = S.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence above, at t=11, we have a11=U to y=9 at t=12.\n\nThen at t=12, a12=S, stay.\n\nBut a12 doesn't affect the position at t=12.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nIn this sequence, at t=10, we go to y=7, which is safe since t=10<12.\n\nt=11 to y=8, t=11<12 safe.\n\nt=12 to y=9.\n\nBut we have y=7 at t=10, which is before unsafe period.\n\nNow, is there a way to have fewer actions?\n\nSuppose we go down at t=2 to y=1, then at t=3, instead of staying, we go down to y=0 at t=4.\n\nThen at t=4 y=0, then go up: a4=U to y=1 t=5, a5=U to y=2 t=6, ..., to y=9 at t=13, later, H larger.\n\nNot better.\n\nAt t=2, go up to y=3 at t=3, but then we cannot avoid t=4 unsafe.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's check if we can reach at t=11.\n\ny_{11}=9.\n\nThen from start y=2 at t=2, to y=9 at t=11, 9 steps? y from 2 to 9, difference 7, but from t=2 to t=11, 9 turns? Positions at t=2 to t=11, 10 positions, 9 intervals.\n\ny at t=2:2, after actions, y at t=11:9, so 9 actions? Actions from t=2 to t=10, to reach at t=11.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{2 + H -1} =9.\n\nSet 2 + H -1 =11, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nThen actions from t=2 to t=11? Let's see.\n\nIf y_{11}=9, then actions a2 to a10 applied from t=2 to t=10, to set y at t=11.\n\nFor example, at t=2 y=2, a2=U to y=3 t=3\n\na3=U to y=4 t=4 but t=4 y=4 unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\na2=D to y=1 t=3\n\na3=U to y=2 t=4 but t=4 y=2 unsafe.\n\na3=S to y=1 t=4, safe, but y=1 at t=4.\n\nThen from there, to y=9 at t=11: from t=4 y=1 to t=11 y=9, that's 7 steps: y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 positions at t=4 to t=11, 8 positions, 7 actions: a4 to a10.\n\nBut we have a2 and a3 before.\n\nSo actions a2 to a10, 9 actions? t=2 to t=10 inclusive: 9 actions.\n\nThen y at t=11=9.\n\nBut with a2 and a3, we have y at t=4=1.\n\nThen a4=U to y=2 t=5\n\na5=U to y=3 t=6\n\na6=U to y=4 t=7\n\na7=U to y=5 t=8\n\na8=U to y=6 t=9\n\na9=U to y=7 t=10\n\na10=U to y=8 t=11? a10 at t=10, to y=11.\n\ny at t=11: from a10 applied at t=10, from y=7? Let's list:\n\nt=4: y=1 (after a3)\n\na4=U: to y=2 at t=5\n\nt=5: y=2\n\na5=U: to y=3 at t=6\n\nt=6: y=3\n\na6=U: to y=4 at t=7\n\nt=7: y=4\n\na7=U: to y=5 at t=8\n\nt=8: y=5\n\na8=U: to y=6 at t=9\n\nt=9: y=6\n\na9=U: to y=7 at t=10\n\nt=10: y=7\n\nNow, to be at y=9 at t=11, we need at t=10, from y=7, to go to y=9, but we can only go to y=6,7,8.\n\nMax to y=8 with U.\n\nSo y=8 at t=11.\n\nThen a10=U to y=8? From y=7 at t=10, a10=U to y=8 at t=11.\n\nThen at t=11 y=8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=11, we need y=8 at t=10 or y=9 at t=10 or y=10, but max y=9.\n\nIf at t=10 y=8, then a10=U to y=9 at t=11.\n\nBut in the sequence above, at t=10, we are at y=7, so we can only go to y=8 at t=11.\n\nThus, from y=1 at t=4, to y=7 at t=10, that's after 6 actions (a4 to a9), to y=7 at t=10.\n\nThen a10=U to y=8 at t=11.\n\nThen to y=9 at t=12.\n\nCannot reach y=9 before t=12 from this start.\n\nIf we start going up earlier, but cannot due to t=4.\n\nThus, minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we need to output.\n\nIn the sequence, for freeway 7 and 8, we passed before t=12, safe.\n\nBut is there a shorter path by using y=5 or 6 longer? But y=5 and 6 are safe, but we need to go to 9, so must go through 7 and 8.\n\nNo bypass.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nNow, in the action sequence, at t=3, we did S, but we could do D to y=0, but worse.\n\nIn this case, with a3=S.\n\nWe could at t=2, do S to y=2 at t=3, then D to y=1 at t=4, same effect.\n\nBut in the sequence, let's write.\n\nAnswer format.\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nSo for t_1=2.\n\nAnd H=11.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 2: D\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nThen for Turn 12: since H=11, we need up to a_{t_1 + H -1} = a_{12}\n\nAt Turn 12, we are at y=9, so action can be S.\n\nIn the sequence, Turn 12: S\n\nBut in the action, at Turn 12, we apply a12, which can be S.\n\nNow, to write in box.\n\nBut let's confirm the freeways at the times.\n\nt=2: y=2, action D, to y=1 at t=3\n\nt=3: y=1, action S, to y=1 at t=4\n\nt=4: y=1, action U, to y=2 at t=5\n\nt=5: y=2, action U, to y=3 at t=6\n\nt=6: y=3, action U, to y=4 at t=7\n\nt=7: y=4, action U, to y=5 at t=8\n\nt=8: y=5, action U, to y=6 at t=9\n\nt=9: y=6, action U, to y=7 at t=10\n\nt=10: y=7, action U, to y=8 at t=11\n\nt=11: y=8, action U, to y=9 at t=12\n\nt=12: y=9, action S (if needed)\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nt=2: y=2, safe (not t=4)\n\nt=3: y=1, safe\n\nt=4: y=1, safe\n\nt=5: y=2, safe (t=5>4)\n\nt=6: y=3, safe\n\nt=7: y=4, safe\n\nt=8: y=5, safe\n\nt=9: y=6, safe\n\nt=10: y=7, t=10<12, safe\n\nt=11: y=8, t=11<12, safe\n\nt=12: y=9, safe\n\nAll good.\n\nThe minimal H is 11.\n\nBut in the sequence, for the answer, we list actions for Turn 2 to Turn 12? But Turn 12 is included.\n\nSince we reach at t=12, and action at t=12 is not necessary, but to follow the format.\n\nIn the box, we can list from Turn 2 to Turn 11? But H=11 requires up to a12.\n\nPerhaps list the actions until the turn before reaching, but the definition includes a_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nI think it's fine to include.\n\nNow, for the car on freeway 7 and 8, we have unsafe at t=12,13,14, but we are at y=7 at t=10, which is fine.\n\nBut at t=12, if we were on y=7, it would be unsafe, but we are not.\n\nIn this path, we are on y=8 at t=11, which is before.\n\nt=11<12.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn 2: D\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: S  (since at y=9)\n\nBut for Turn 12, action S.\n\nIn the sequence, Turn 11: U to y=9 at t=12.\n\nThen Turn 12: S to stay, but y=9.\n\nNow, to write in box.\n\nPerhaps we can omit Turn 12 action, but I think we should include for completeness.\n\nSince the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", and after that, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn this case, for H=11, t from 0 to 10, actions a2 to a12.\n\nAfter applying, at turn t_1 + H =2+11=13, but we want y_{t_1 + H -1}=y_{12}=9.\n\nAfter applying a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, the position at turn t_1 + H is set, but we want position at turn t_1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\nTo have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, the actions a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -2} determine y_{t_1 + H -1}, and a_{t_1 + H -1} is applied at turn t_1 + H -1 to go to y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut for the sequence, we include a_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nIn practice, for the last action, it can be chosen to not move or something.\n\nIn this case, for y_{12}=9, we need actions up to a11 to set it, since a11 at t=11 sets y12.\n\nThen a12 is extra.\n\nBut in the sequence for H=11, it includes a12.\n\nPerhaps for H, it is the number of actions to reach, so y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nThe problem says: \"y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nSo it's fixed.\n\nI think we should proceed with the sequence.\n\nIn the answer, we can list:\n\nFor H=11, actions:\n\nTurn 2: D\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: S\n\nBut at Turn 12, we set S, but it is after reaching.\n\nSince at Turn 11, with U, we go to y=9 at Turn 12.\n\nThen for Turn 12, we can set S.\n\nNow, for the box.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on rows \\(y = 2, 3, 4\\) at turn \\(t = 4\\) (when these rows are unsafe) and not on rows \\(y = 7, 8\\) at turns \\(t = 12, 13, 14\\) (when these rows are unsafe). The player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn \\(t = 12\\).\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n- At turn \\(t = 2\\), move down (D) to avoid being on \\(y = 2\\) at \\(t = 4\\) and go to \\(y = 1\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 3\\), stay (S) to remain on \\(y = 1\\), which is safe at \\(t = 4\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 4\\), move up (U) to \\(y = 2\\), now safe since \\(t > 4\\).\n- From turns \\(t = 5\\) to \\(t = 11\\), move up (U) each turn to progress toward \\(y = 9\\), passing through all rows safely:\n  - \\(y = 7\\) at \\(t = 10\\) and \\(y = 8\\) at \\(t = 11\\) are safe because \\(t < 12\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 12\\), the player is at \\(y = 9\\), so the action is stay (S) to remain at the goal.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in \\(H = 11\\) turns, with \\(y_{t_1 + H - 1} = y_{12} = 9\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 2: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: S \\\\ \\end{array} }",

The player moves up, down, or stays, changing y-position each turn. Cars move left or right at constant speeds, and I collide if at turn T, I'm on a freeway where a car occupies x=0 at that turn.\n\nFirst, I should figure out for each freeway and each turn, whether x=0 is occupied by any car on that freeway at that turn. Since the cars move linearly, I can compute for each car when it occupies x=0.\n\nThe collision condition is that at turn T, if I'm on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, at turn T, there is a car where x=0 is within its span. So I need to know for each freeway and each turn, if x=0 is covered by any car on that row.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t_1 = 5. So turns are from t=5 onwards.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions for t=5,6,7,... up to some H where I reach y=9.\n\ny starts at 2, and I need to get to 9, so I must move up at least 7 times. But I might move down or stay to avoid cars, so H could be more than 7.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0, or +1, so net change must be +7 to go from 2 to 9.\n\nNow, let's list all the cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\nSince it's right-moving, span at time T is [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFor right-moving: at time t_1, span is [τ, h], then at time T, it's [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but here all cars seem right-moving except possibly, but in the table, all are right, I think.\n\nLet me check:\n\nFreeway 1: (-48, -59, right, 3)\n\n-48 and -59, with direction right. Since it's right-moving, head is larger than tail? Typically, head is the front.\n\nIn the span, for right-moving, at t_1, [τ, h] with h > τ, I assume.\n\nHere, h = -48, τ = -59, so τ = -59, h = -48, so since right-moving, h > τ, -48 > -59, yes.\n\nSo at t_1=5, span is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nThen at time T, span is [τ + s(T-5), h + s(T-5)] = [-59 + 3(T-5), -48 + 3(T-5)]\n\nx=0 is occupied if 0 is between -59 + 3(T-5) and -48 + 3(T-5), inclusive? Since it's a span, probably inclusive.\n\nSo inequality: -59 + 3(T-5) ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 3(T-5)\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut since the car is moving right, and positions are increasing.\n\nSo let's solve for T when 0 is in the span.\n\nLeft end: L(T) = -59 + 3(T-5)\n\nRight end: R(T) = -48 + 3(T-5)\n\n0 in [L(T), R(T)] iff L(T) ≤ 0 ≤ R(T)\n\nNow L(T) ≤ 0: -59 + 3(T-5) ≤ 0 => 3(T-5) ≤ 59 => T-5 ≤ 59/3 = 19.666, so T ≤ 5 + 19.666 = 24.666, so T ≤ 24 since T integer? Turns are integers, I assume.\n\nT is turn number, so integer.\n\nSimilarly, 0 ≤ R(T): 0 ≤ -48 + 3(T-5) => 48 ≤ 3(T-5) => 16 ≤ T-5 => T ≥ 21\n\nSo for freeway 1, occupied when T ≥ 21 and T ≤ 24\n\nL(T) ≤ 0: -59 + 3(T-5) ≤ 0 => 3(T-5) ≤ 59 => T-5 ≤ 19 + 2/3, since 59/3=19.666, so T-5 ≤ 19 because integer? T-5 integer, so 3(k) ≤ 59 where k=T-5, so k ≤ floor(59/3) = 19? 3*19=57<59, 3*20=60>59, so for k=19, L= -59+3*19= -59+57= -2 ≤0, yes\n\nk=20, L= -59+60=1 >0?

Let's see:\n\nt=5: y=2\n\nAfter action at t=5: y_{t=6} = y5 + Δy, with action at t.\n\nNotation: at turn t, I take action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nPosition is given at turn t_1=5 as (0, y5) = (0,2)\n\nThen for turn t=5, I take action a_5, which sets y_6 = y5 + Δy_5\n\nThen at turn t=6, I am at (0, y6), and take action a_6, and so on.\n\nCollision at turn t occurs if at that turn, I am on y_t, and freeway y_t is occupied at turn t.\n\nFor example, at turn t=5, I am on y=2, and freeway 2 is not occupied at t=5 (only at t=8), so safe.\n\nSimilarly, at turn t=6, I am on y=6? No.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\n- At turn t=5: position y=2, freeway 2 not occupied at t=5, safe.\n\nAction a_5 = U, so y_6 = 2 +1 =3\n\n- Turn t=6: position y=3, freeway 3 occupied? Freeway 3 occupied at t=8 only? Freeway 3: from above, occupied at T=8.\n\nAt t=6, not occupied, since only t=8.\n\nFreeway 3: cars same as freeway 2, occupied only at t=8.\n\nSo at t=6, y=3, not occupied, safe.\n\nAction a_6 = U, y_7 =4\n\n- Turn t=7: position y=4, freeway 4 occupied? Only at t=8, not t=7, so safe.\n\nAction a_7 = U, y_8 =5\n\n- Turn t=8: position y=5, freeway 5 occupied? Freeway 5 occupied at t=11 and 12, not at t=8. So not occupied, safe.\n\nAction a_8 = U, y_9 =6\n\n- Turn t=9: position y=6, freeway 6 occupied? At t=11 and 12, not t=9, safe.\n\nAction a_9 = U, y_10 =7\n\n- Turn t=10: position y=7, freeway 7 occupied? At t=12,13,14, not t=10, safe.\n\nAction a_10 = U, y_11 =8\n\n- Turn t=11: position y=8, freeway 8 occupied? At t=12,13,14, not t=11, so safe? Freeway 8 occupied t=12,13,14, t=11 not, so safe.\n\nAction a_11 = U, y_12 =9\n\n- Turn t=12: position y=9, but y=9 is not a freeway, it's the top, no cars, so safe. And we reached y=9 at turn t=12.\n\nt=12: y=9, which is the target.\n\nStarted at t=5, y=2.\n\nAfter actions from t=5 to t=11, 7 actions: U,U,U,U,U,U,U to go from 2 to 9 in 7 steps.\n\ny_6=3, y_7=4, y_8=5, y_9=6, y_10=7, y_11=8, y_12=9.\n\nAt which turns was I on freeways?\n\nt=5: y=2, freeway 2 not occ t=5\n\nt=6: y=3, freeway 3 not occ except t=8, safe\n\nt=7: y=4, freeway 4 not occ except t=8, safe\n\nt=8: y=5, freeway 5 occ at t=11,12, not t=8, safe\n\nt=9: y=6, freeway 6 occ at t=11,12, not t=9, safe\n\nt=10: y=7, freeway 7 occ at t=12,13,14, not t=10, safe\n\nt=11: y=8, freeway 8 occ at t=12,13,14, not t=11, safe\n\nt=12: y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nSo all safe, and I reached in 7 turns, from t=5 to t=11 actions, H=7 turns? Number of actions.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t=5 to t=11, that's 7 actions, and at turn t=12, I am at y=9.\n\nThe minimal H such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9? Let's see the notation.\n\n\"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nSo actions for t from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position is y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nSet t_1 + H = time when y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, after action a_{t} at turn t, we go to y_{t+1}.\n\nSo to be at y=9 at turn T, that means after the action at turn T-1, we have y_T =9.\n\nThe position at turn T is y_T.\n\nWe start at turn t_1 with y_{t_1} =2.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1} at turn t_1, we go to y_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + H -1} at turn t_1 + H -1, we go to y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nSo H actions, and we reach at turn t_1 + H.\n\nIn this case, t_1=5, y_5=2.\n\nAfter a_5, y_6\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{5+H-1}, y_{5+H} =9.\n\nIn my earlier, I have y_12=9, so 5+H=12, H=7.\n\nActions from t=5 to t=11, which is t_1 + t for t=0 to 6? Let's index.\n\nt from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor H=7, actions at t=5,6,7,8,9,10,11.\n\nIn my sequence, all U, and no collisions.\n\nBut in t=8, I was on y=5, which is freeway 5, but occupied at t=11,12, not t=8, so fine.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut is there a problem? Freeway 2,3,4 occupied at t=8.\n\nIn my sequence, at t=8, I was on y=5, not on y=2,3,4.\n\ny=5 is freeway 5, not occupied at t=8.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut let me confirm freeway 5 at t=8.\n\nFreeway 5: occupied t=11,12, not t=8.\n\nSimilarly, at t=11, I was on y=8, freeway 8 occupied t=12,13,14, not t=11, so fine.\n\nAnd at t=12, I am on y=9, not a freeway.\n\nSo with H=7, all U actions, I can reach.\n\nBut the problem is to minimize H, and 7 is minimum possible since 7 steps up.\n\nBut is there any issue?\n\nIn freeway 2,3,4, at t=8, they are occupied, but in my path, I am not on those at t=8; at t=8 I am on y=5.\n\nSimilarly, no conflict.\n\nPerhaps I should list the occupation again to be sure.\n\nFreeway 1: occ t=21-24, irrelevant for us.\n\nFreeway 2: occ only t=8\n\nFreeway 3: occ only t=8\n\nFreeway 4: occ only t=8\n\nFreeway 5: occ t=11,12\n\nFreeway 6: occ t=11,12\n\nFreeway 7: occ t=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 8: occ t=12,13,14\n\nIn the sequence:\n\n- t=5: y=2, freeway 2 occ? No, only t=8, so safe.\n\n- t=6: y=3, freeway 3 occ? Only t=8, no.\n\n- t=7: y=4, freeway 4 occ? Only t=8, no.\n\n- t=8: y=5, freeway 5 occ? t=11,12, not t=8, no.\n\n- t=9: y=6, freeway 6 occ? t=11,12, not t=9, no.\n\n- t=10: y=7, freeway 7 occ? t=12,13,14, not t=10, no.\n\n- t=11: y=8, freeway 8 occ? t=12,13,14, not t=11, no.\n\n- t=12: y=9, safe.\n\nAll clear.\n\nBut at t=12, y=9, reached.\n\nAnd actions: all U from t=5 to t=11.\n\nt=5 to t=11 inclusive, that's 7 actions.\n\nNow, the answer should be the sequence.\n\nBut let me see if I can do in fewer? H=7 is minimum, since need +7 in y.\n\nUnless I go down and up, but that would increase H, so no, min H=7.\n\nBut is there a reason I need to wait? In this case, no.\n\nBut let me check freeway 7 and 8 at t=12.\n\nAt t=12, freeway 7 is occupied, but if I were on y=7 at t=12, I would collide, but in my sequence, at t=12 I am on y=9, not y=7.\n\nSimilarly, at t=11, I am on y=8, not occupied.\n\nAll fine.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if I stay or something, but not necessary.\n\nAnother thing: at turn t=8, freeway 2,3,4 are occupied, so if I were on y=2,3, or 4 at t=8, I would collide, but I am on y=5.\n\nSimilarly, at t=11,12, freeway 5 and 6 occupied, but at t=11, I am on y=8, not 5 or 6; at t=12, I am on y=9.\n\nAt t=12, freeway 5,6,7,8 are occupied, but I am on y=9, safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=7 with all U actions.\n\nBut the sequence should be given.\n\nAnswer format:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} etc.\n\nt_1=5.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nAnd after that, at turn 12, y=9.\n\nBut the actions are up to t=11, which is t_1 + H -1 =5+7-1=11, yes.\n\nt from 5 to 11.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me make sure about the car on freeway 1, but it's at high turns, not relevant.\n\nPerhaps I miscomputed for freeway 5.\n\nFreeway 5: car (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nAt t_1=5, k=0, span [-47,-36]\n\nAt T, [ -47 +6k, -36 +6k]\n\n0 in: -47+6k <=0 and 0<= -36+6k\n\n-47+6k <=0 => k<=47/6=7.833, k<=7\n\n0<= -36+6k => k>=6\n\nk=6: -47+36= -11 <=0, -36+36=0, so 0<=0 true\n\nk=7: -47+42= -5 <=0, -36+42=6>=0, true\n\nk=8: -47+48=1>0, not <=0, so not.\n\nSo T=5+6=11, 5+7=12.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn sequence, at t=11, I am on y=8, not freeway 5 or 6.\n\nFreeway 6 same.\n\nAt t=12, freeway 7 and 8 occupied, but I am on y=9.\n\nSo all good.\n\nPerhaps I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nIn this case H=7.\n\nBut is there a way with H=6? No, because from y=2 to y=9, min 7 steps, each action changes y by at most 1, so must have at least 7 actions.\n\nThus H=7 is minimal.\n\nAnd with all U, it works.\n\nBut just to be thorough, suppose at some point I need to avoid, but here not necessary.\n\nFor example, if I were to be on y=5 at t=11, but in my path, at t=11 I am on y=8, not y=5.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U from turn 5 to turn 11.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\end{array} }\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n\nIn the format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1} etc.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nAnd H=7.\n\nBut the box should contain only the actions, I think, with the turns.\n\nThe answer says: \"Answer Format: \\boxed{ Turn t_1: a_{t_1} Turn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1} ... }\"\n\nSo I need to list them.\n\nSince H=7, actions at t=5 to 11.\n\nPerhaps I should write the turns.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be clear.\n\nAnother thing: in the car state, for freeway 2,3,4, there are multiple cars, but I think I covered, since only the third one covers x=0 at t=8.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nI think it's correct.\n\nSo minimal H is 7 with all up actions.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 5\\) is 7. The sequence of actions consists of moving up (\"U\") at every turn from turn 5 to turn 11, inclusive. This sequence avoids all collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) because:\n\n- At turn 5, the player is on freeway 2, which is not occupied at turn 5 (only occupied at turn 8).\n- At turn 6, the player is on freeway 3, which is not occupied at turn 6 (only occupied at turn 8).\n- At turn 7, the player is on freeway 4, which is not occupied at turn 7 (only occupied at turn 8).\n- At turn 8, the player is on freeway 5, which is not occupied at turn 8 (occupied at turns 11 and 12).\n- At turn 9, the player is on freeway 6, which is not occupied at turn 9 (occupied at turns 11 and 12).\n- At turn 10, the player is on freeway 7, which is not occupied at turn 10 (occupied at turns 12, 13, and 14).\n- At turn 11, the player is on freeway 8, which is not occupied at turn 11 (occupied at turns 12, 13, and 14).\n- At turn 12, the player reaches \\(y = 9\\), which is not a freeway and has no cars, so it is safe.\n\nThe sequence of actions achieves \\(y = 9\\) at turn 12 (after the action at turn 11) with the minimum possible \\(H = 7\\), as at least 7 up moves are required to increase the y-coordinate from 2 to 9.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,3) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 6, and I start at y=3.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. Each car has a head, tail, direction, and speed. For right-moving cars, the span moves right as time increases, meaning the positions increase. For left-moving, it decreases. But in this case, all cars are right-moving, according to the table. Let me check.\n\nLooking at the car states:\n\n- Freeway 1: (-45, -56, right, 3) — head is -45, tail is -56? That seems odd because usually head is the front, so for right-moving, head should be greater than tail if it's moving right. But here head is -45 and tail is -56, which means head is larger since -45 > -56, so it is right-moving, and the span is from tail to head: [-56, -45]? No.\n\nThe notation says: for left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ], and for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h]. Let me read carefully.\n\nFrom the car update rules:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → moves left: h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)\n\n- Right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → moves right: τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)\n\nIn the table, for each car, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s).\n\nFor freeway 1: (-45, -56, right, 3)\n\nSince direction is right, the span is [τ, h] = [-56, -45] at t1=6.\n\nSimilarly, for others.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y at turn T, and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nAlso, when moving, if I move at turn T, I am on y_T during turn T, and I move to y_{T+1} at the end of the turn or something? The player update: at turn t, I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nLet's see: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\" based on a_t.\n\nAnd \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\ny_T is the position at turn T, I think.\n\nAt turn T, player is at position (0, y_T), and if y_T is between 1 and 8, and there is a car on that freeway with 0 in its span at time T, collision.\n\nAlso, the note: if I move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, I am not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so only the freeway I'm currently on matters for collision.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=3 at t=6 to y=9 at some turn, with min H.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and there are no cars on y=9, since freeways are y=1 to 8, so once I reach y=9, I'm safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars, but I start at y=3 and need to reach y=9.\n\ny=0 might be safe, but I need to go up.\n\nActions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), S (stay, y same).\n\ny must be between 0 and 9, so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nNow, the cars: I need to find when they are at x=0 for each freeway.\n\nSince the player is always at x=0, collision when car span includes 0 at that turn.\n\nFor each freeway and each turn, I need to see if there is a car covering x=0.\n\nBut turns are discrete, I think.\n\nTime is in turns, so T is integer.\n\nt1 = 6, current turn.\n\nI need to compute for each freeway, the times when a car has 0 in its span.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: only one car: (h, τ, d, s) = (-45, -56, right, 3)\n\nSince right-moving, span at t: [τ + s(t - t1), h + s(t - t1)] with t1=6.\n\nSpan at time t: [τ + s(t - 6), h + s(t - 6)] for this car.\n\nτ = -56, h = -45, s=3.\n\nSo span at t: [-56 + 3(t-6), -45 + 3(t-6)]\n\nSimplify: [-56 + 3t - 18, -45 + 3t - 18] = [3t - 74, 3t - 63]\n\n0 in span if 3t - 74 <= 0 <= 3t - 63\n\nSo 3t - 74 <= 0 and 0 <= 3t - 63\n\nFrom 0 <= 3t - 63 => 3t >= 63 => t >= 21\n\nFrom 3t - 74 <= 0 => 3t <= 74 => t <= 74/3 ≈ 24.666, so t <= 24 since integer.\n\nt >=21 and t <=24.\n\nSo on freeway 1, collision at t=21,22,23,24.\n\nNow freeway 2: multiple cars.\n\nCars: (24,13,right,12), (60,49,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFirst car: (h=24, τ=13, d=right, s=12)\n\nSpan at t: [τ + s(t-6), h + s(t-6)] = [13 + 12(t-6), 24 + 12(t-6)] = [13 +12t -72, 24 +12t -72] = [12t -59, 12t -48]\n\n0 in span if 12t -59 <= 0 <= 12t -48\n\nSo 12t -59 <= 0 => t <= 59/12 ≈ 4.916, so t <=4? But t starts from t=6, current is t=6, and t increases.\n\nt is turn, current t=6, we care about t>=6.\n\n12t -59 <=0 => t <= 59/12 ≈4.916, since t>=6 >4.916, this is always false for t>=6? 12t -59 for t=6: 72-59=13>0, so 12t-59 >=13>0 for t>=6, so 12t-59 <=0 false. Thus 0 not in span for t>=6. Similarly, 12t-48 >= 72-48=24>0 for t=6, so 0 <= 12t-48 false since 12t-48>0. So 0 not in span for any t>=6 for this car.\n\n0 in span requires 12t-59 <=0 and 0<=12t-48.\n\nBut 12t-59 <=0 only for t<=4.916, and for t>=6, 12t-59 >=13>0, so inequality 12t-59 <=0 false. Similarly, 0<=12t-48 is true for t>=4 since 12*4-48=0, but t>=6, so true, but since first inequality false, no.\n\nSo no collision from this car on freeway 2 for t>=6.\n\nSecond car on freeway 2: (60,49,right,12)\n\nτ=49, h=60? Head and tail.\n\nGiven as (head h, tail τ), so for right, span [τ, h] at t1.\n\nτ=49, h=60, s=12.\n\nSpan at t: [49 +12(t-6), 60 +12(t-6)] = [49 +12t -72, 60 +12t -72] = [12t -23, 12t -12]\n\n0 in span if 12t-23 <=0 <=12t-12\n\n12t-23 <=0 => t <= 23/12 ≈1.916\n\n12t-12 >=0 => t>=1\n\nBut t>=6, both not satisfied, 12t-23 >= 72-23=49>0 for t=6, so false. Similarly, 12t-12>0. So no.\n\nThird car on freeway 2: (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nτ=-35, h=-24, s=12\n\nSpan at t: [-35 +12(t-6), -24 +12(t-6)] = [-35 +12t -72, -24 +12t -72] = [12t -107, 12t -96]\n\n0 in span if 12t-107 <=0 <=12t-96\n\n12t-107 <=0 => t <= 107/12 ≈8.916, so t<=8\n\n12t-96 >=0 => t>=8\n\nSo t>=8 and t<=8, so t=8.\n\n12t-96 >=0 => t>=96/12=8\n\n12t-107 <=0 => t<=107/12=8.916, so t<=8 since integer? t=8.\n\nt<=8 and t>=8, so only t=8.\n\nFor t=8: 12*8 -107 = 96-107= -11 <=0, and 0 <= 96-96=0, yes 0<=0.\n\nFor t=9: 12*9-107=108-107=1>0, so 1<=0 false? 12t-107 <=0 for t=9: 1 <=0 false.\n\nAnd 12t-96=108-96=12>0, 0<=12 true, but first false.\n\nSo only t=8.\n\nBut freeway 2 has multiple cars, so collision if any car has 0 in span.\n\nFor freeway 2, at t=8, the third car has 0 in span.\n\nNow, other cars on freeway 2 don't have for t>=6, so only t=8 is collision on freeway 2.\n\nt=8.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? Cars listed: (24,13,right,12), (60,49,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12) — identical to freeway 2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same cars.\n\nIn the table:\n\n| Freeway k | Cars |\n\n| 1 | (-45,-56,right,3) |\n\n| 2 | (24,13,right,12), (60,49,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12) |\n\n| 3 | same as 2: (24,13,right,12), (60,49,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12) |\n\n| 4 | same |\n\n| 5 | (-30,-41,right,6) |\n\n| 6 | (-30,-41,right,6) |\n\n| 7 | (-24,-35,right,4) |\n\n| 8 | (-24,-35,right,4) |\n\nFreeways 2,3,4 all have the same set of cars? So same collision times.\n\nFor freeway 3, cars same as freeway 2, so collision at t=8 only, from the third car.\n\nSimilarly freeway 4 same.\n\nNow freeway 5: (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nτ=-41, h=-30, s=6, right-moving.\n\nSpan at t: [-41 +6(t-6), -30 +6(t-6)] = [-41 +6t -36, -30 +6t -36] = [6t -77, 6t -66]\n\n0 in span if 6t-77 <=0 <=6t-66\n\n6t-77 <=0 => t <= 77/6 ≈12.833, t<=12\n\n6t-66 >=0 => t >=11\n\nSo t>=11 and t<=12, so t=11,12.\n\nFor t=11: 6*11-77=66-77=-11<=0, 0<=66-66=0, true.\n\nt=12: 72-77=-5<=0, 0<=72-66=6, true.\n\nt=13: 78-77=1>0, false; 78-66=12>0, true but first false.\n\nSo t=11,12.\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5, (-30,-41,right,6), so same, collision at t=11,12.\n\nNow freeway 7: (-24,-35,right,4)\n\nτ=-35, h=-24, s=4\n\nSpan at t: [-35 +4(t-6), -24 +4(t-6)] = [-35 +4t -24, -24 +4t -24]? -24 +4(t-6) = -24 +4t -24 = 4t -48? Let's compute:\n\nτ + s(t-6) = -35 +4(t-6) = -35 +4t -24 = 4t -59\n\nh + s(t-6) = -24 +4(t-6) = -24 +4t -24 = 4t -48? -24 -24 = -48, yes.\n\nSo span: [4t -59, 4t -48]\n\n0 in span if 4t-59 <=0 <=4t-48\n\n4t-59 <=0 => t <= 59/4 = 14.75, t<=14\n\n4t-48 >=0 => t >=12\n\nSo t>=12 and t<=14, so t=12,13,14.\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7, (-24,-35,right,4), so collision at t=12,13,14.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, times when collision occurs (0 in span):\n\n- y=1: t=21,22,23,24\n\n- y=2: t=8 (from the third car)\n\n- y=3: same as y=2, t=8\n\n- y=4: same, t=8\n\n- y=5: t=11,12\n\n- y=6: t=11,12\n\n- y=7: t=12,13,14\n\n- y=8: t=12,13,14\n\nAlso, for freeways with no cars or no collision times, safe.\n\nBut all have cars except y=9, but y=9 no freeway, safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe always.\n\nNow, player starts at y=3 at t=6.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nThe minimal H might be from t=6 to some T when I reach y=9.\n\nSince I start at y=3, and y=9 is 6 units up, I need at least 6 turns if I go up every time, but I might need to avoid collisions, so possibly more.\n\nBut I can stay or go down to avoid, but going down might take more time.\n\nSince the goal is to minimize turns, I should go up as much as possible, but avoid being on a freeway when collision happens.\n\nAt each turn, I choose action to change y.\n\nLet me denote the turn sequence starting from t=6.\n\nLet t be absolute turn.\n\nAt t=6, y=3.\n\nNow, I need to see for each freeway at each time if it is occupied.\n\nBut collision only if I am on that freeway at that time.\n\nFor example, at t=6, what is the state?\n\nFirst, for y=3, freeway 3, at t=6.\n\nIs there collision at t=6 on y=3?\n\nFrom above, for y=3, collision only at t=8, not at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, other times.\n\nAt t=6, y=3 is safe, since collision only at t=8.\n\nNow, I need to plan the path.\n\nThe minimal H: since from y=3 to y=9, I need to increase by 6, each U action increases y by 1, S or D don't, so to minimize turns, I should use U as much as possible, but might need to S or D to avoid being on a bad freeway at bad time.\n\nBut D down might be counterproductive, but sometimes necessary to wait.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, and no cars above, I should go up.\n\nBut let's see the collision times.\n\nFirst, list all dangerous times per freeway:\n\ny=1: dangerous at t=21-24, but y=1 is low, and I start at y=3, going up, so probably not relevant, since I won't be there.\n\nSimilarly, y=2,3,4 dangerous at t=8.\n\ny=5 and 6 dangerous at t=11,12.\n\ny=7 and 8 dangerous at t=12,13,14.\n\nI start at y=3 at t=6.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe fastest way is to go up every turn: actions U,U,U,U,U,U to go from 3 to 9 in 6 turns: t=6 to t=11? Let's see.\n\nAt t=6, y=3, action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn t=6: action a_6, then y_7 = y_6 + Δy based on a_6.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nStart: t=6, y=3.\n\nIf I do U at t=6, then y_7 = 4\n\nt=7, if U, y_8=5\n\nt=8, if U, y_9=6\n\nt=9, if U, y_10=7\n\nt=10, if U, y_11=8\n\nt=11, if U, y_12=9\n\nThen at t=12, I am at y=9, but I need to be at y=9 at some turn, and H is the number of actions, from t=6 to t=6+H-1.\n\nLet me define the turn when I arrive.\n\nAfter H actions, I reach y=9 at turn t=6 + H.\n\nt=6: after 0 actions, y=3\n\nAfter first action at t=6, y_{7} set.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t=6 + H, I have y_{6+H}.\n\nI need y_{6+H} =9.\n\nAnd H minimal.\n\nIn the sequence above, if I do U each turn from t=6 to t=11, that's 6 actions: a6 to a11.\n\nThen y12=9.\n\nNow, check for collision during the path.\n\nAt each turn t, when I am at y_t, if y_t between 1 and 8, check if collision at that turn.\n\nt=6: y=3, on freeway 3. Collision at t=8 only, not t=6, so safe.\n\nt=7: after a6=U, y7=4, on freeway 4. Collision on y=4 at t=8 only, not t=7, so safe.\n\nt=8: now y8, depending on action.\n\nIf at t=7, I did U, y8=5.\n\nOn freeway 5. Collision on y=5 at t=11,12? t=8 is not 11 or 12, so safe? y=5 dangerous at t=11,12, t=8 is earlier, so no car at x=0, safe.\n\nBut let's confirm.\n\nAt t=8, y=5.\n\nFreeway 5 cars: dangerous only at t=11,12, so at t=8, no collision.\n\nSimilarly, t=9: y9, if I continue, y9=6 (after U at t=8)\n\nOn freeway 6, dangerous at t=11,12, t=9 not, safe.\n\nt=10: y10=7 (after U at t=9), on freeway 7, dangerous at t=12,13,14, t=10 not, safe.\n\nt=11: y11=8 (after U at t=10), on freeway 8, dangerous at t=12,13,14, t=11 not, safe? t=11 is before 12.\n\ny=8 dangerous t=12,13,14, so t=11 safe.\n\nThen t=12: y12=9, which is safe, no freeway.\n\nIn this path, I reach y=9 at t=12, with H=6 actions: a6 to a11 all U.\n\nBut at no point was I on a freeway during collision time.\n\nFor example, at t=8, I was on y=5, which is safe at t=8.\n\ny=5 dangerous only t=11,12.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut I need to check if at any turn I would be collided.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\n- t=6: y=3, safe\n\n- t=7: y=4, safe\n\n- t=8: y=5, safe (since y=5 collision only t=11,12)\n\n- t=9: y=6, safe (y=6 collision t=11,12)\n\n- t=10: y=7, safe (y=7 collision t=12,13,14, t=10 not)\n\n- t=11: y=8, safe (y=8 collision t=12,13,14, t=11 not)\n\n- t=12: y=9, safe\n\nSo all good, and I reach at t=12.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, from t=6 to t=6+H-1, with y at t=6+H-1 being 9? Let's clarify the indexing.\n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so t from 0 to H-1, so actions at time t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nThen after these actions, position at time t_1 + H should be (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence: actions at t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H -1, and after that, at time t_1 + H, y =9.\n\nIn this case, t_1=6.\n\nAfter H actions, at time 6+H, y=9.\n\nIn my sequence, with H=6, actions at t=6,7,8,9,10,11 (t=0 to 5, since t=0: a_{6+0}=a6, t=1: a7, ..., t=5: a11)\n\nThen at time 6+6=12, y=9.\n\nAnd all intermediate positions safe.\n\nBut is there a problem at t=8?\n\nt=8 is when I am at y=5, but y=5 collision at t=11,12, not t=8, so fine.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut let's confirm the car positions at t=8 for example.\n\nFor instance, on y=2,3,4, there is collision at t=8.\n\nBut at t=8, in my path, I am on y=5, not on y=2,3,4, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, other times.\n\nSo with 6 actions, I can reach.\n\nBut is it possible in less?\n\nFrom y=3 to y=9, minimum 6 steps up, so H=6 is minimum possible, since each U increases by 1, and S or D would require more actions to compensate.\n\nFor example, if I do S or D, I stay or go down, so I need extra U later, so H would be larger than 6.\n\nThus, H=6 is the minimum possible.\n\nAnd in this case, it seems achievable without collision.\n\nBut in the sequence, at t=11, I am on y=8, which is safe since collision at t=12,13,14.\n\nt=11 y=8 safe, t=12 y=9 safe.\n\nBut let me double-check the collision times.\n\nFor y=8, freeway 8, collision at t=12,13,14.\n\nAt t=12, if I were on y=8, collision, but in the path, at t=12, I am at y=9, not on freeway.\n\nSimilarly, at t=11, I am on y=8, but t=11 not collision time for y=8.\n\ny=8 collision times: from freeway 7 and 8 both have t=12,13,14? Freeway 8 is y=8.\n\ny=8 collision at t=12,13,14.\n\nt=11 is before, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 at t=11 and 12 collision, but in the path, at t=11, I am on y=8, not y=5.\n\nAt t=11, y=8, and y=5 has collision, but I am not on y=5.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is all U for 6 turns.\n\nBut the actions are from t=6 to t=11.\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nH=6.\n\nSequence: a6=U, a7=U, a8=U, a9=U, a10=U, a11=U.\n\nThen at t=12, y=9.\n\nBut is there any constraint I missed?\n\nThe note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\"\n\nIn this case, when I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I move to y_{T+1} at the end, so for collision, only y_T matters at turn T.\n\nIn my path, no problem.\n\nBut let me see if at some point I need to avoid.\n\nFor example, at t=8, y=2,3,4 are dangerous, but I am at y=5, fine.\n\nSimilarly, at t=11, y=5 and 6 dangerous, but I am at y=8.\n\ny=5 and 6 dangerous at t=11,12.\n\nAt t=11, y=5 and y=6 have collision, but I am at y=8, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly at t=12, y=5,6,7,8 all have collision? y=5 at t=12 collision, y=6 t=12 collision, y=7 t=12 collision, y=8 t=12 collision.\n\nBut at t=12, I am at y=9, safe.\n\nSo all good.\n\nThus, minimal H=6 with all U.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 2,3,4, I have collision at t=8, but I was not there.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's list the positions.\n\nFor example, at t=6: I am at y=3, safe.\n\nAfter U, y7=4 at t=7, safe.\n\nAfter U, y8=5 at t=8, on y=5.\n\ny=5: freeway 5, cars with s=6, at t=8.\n\nSpan for y=5 car: [6t-77, 6t-66] at time t.\n\nAt t=8: 6*8 -77=48-77=-29, 6*8-66=48-66=-18, so [-29,-18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nt=9: y=6, on freeway 6, same as y=5, [6t-77,6t-66], at t=9: 54-77=-23, 54-66=-12, [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nt=10: y=7, freeway 7, car span [4t-59,4t-48], at t=10: 40-59=-19, 40-48=-8, [-19,-8], 0 not in.\n\nt=11: y=8, freeway 8, same as y=7, [4t-59,4t-48], at t=11: 44-59=-15, 44-48=-4, [-15,-4], 0 not in.\n\nt=12: y=9, safe.\n\nPerfect.\n\nNow, but in the car list, for freeway 2,3,4, at t=8, collision, but I wasn't there.\n\nFor example, freeway 3 at t=8: the third car, span [12t-107,12t-96], at t=8: 96-107=-11, 96-96=0, so [-11,0], 0 included, so if I were on y=3 at t=8, collision, but I am at y=5.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 6, with all actions U.\n\nBut the answer should be in the box.\n\nBut let me see if H can be less? No, because I need 6 steps up.\n\nUnless I start from y=3, to y=9, delta 6, so min 6 actions, all U.\n\nIf I do D or S, it takes more turns.\n\nSo H=6 is minimum.\n\nAnd achievable.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions from t=6 to t=11.\n\nIn the format.\n\nAlso, the current turn is t_1=6.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nAnd H=6.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nSo for H=6, actions at t=6,7,8,9,10,11.\n\nIn the output, it should be like:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}  (which is U)\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 +1}  (U)\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 + 5: a_{t_1 +5}  (since t from 0 to 5, H-1=5)\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nWith H=6, t_1=6, so actions at 6,7,8,9,10,11.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut I recall that for freeway 1, there is collision at t=21-24, but that is late, not relevant.\n\nAlso, y=9 is safe.\n\nSo I think that's it.\n\nBut the problem has multiple cars on some freeways, but I think I covered.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster, but no.\n\nAnother thing: the player position is (0,y), and cars are on the freeways, but when I move, I change y immediately.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps at some point, if I stay, but in this case, no need.\n\nSo I think the answer is H=6 with all U.\n\nBut let me write the sequence.\n\nAnswer Format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n}\n\nIn the box, it should be with t_1, but since t_1=6, it's fine.\n\nIn the text, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so I should use the variable.\n\nIn the output, it should be with the turn numbers.\n\nLooking at the format: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" so for example, \"Turn 6: U\" since t_1=6.\n\nSimilarly, \"Turn 7: U\" etc.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut H is 6.\n\nThe problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H\", but in the answer format, it doesn't say to state H, only the sequence, but I think H is implied.\n\nRead: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", so I need to state H? But in the answer format, it shows only the sequence.\n\nLook:\n\n\"Answer Format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\"\n\nIt doesn't show H, but since the sequence has H lines, H is the number of actions.\n\nAnd from the last turn, it should reach y=9.\n\nIn this case, with 6 actions.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm if at t=12, y=9, but after last action at t=11, y_{12}=9.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I think that's the answer.\n\nBut in the beginning, I thought about the cars, but in this path, no collision.\n\nPerhaps there is a shorter path? No.\n\nAnother thing: the initial position is (0,3), and I need to reach (0,9), so vertical movement only.\n\nAnd actions affect only y.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is all U for 6 turns.\n\nSo the output.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) is 6. This is achieved by moving up (U) at every turn, increasing the y-coordinate by 1 each time, resulting in reaching y=9 at turn 12.\n\nThe sequence of actions avoids collisions because:\n- At turn 6, y=3: Freeway 3 has a collision only at turn 8, so it is safe at turn 6.\n- At turn 7, y=4: Freeway 4 has a collision only at turn 8, so it is safe at turn 7.\n- At turn 8, y=5: Freeway 5 has collisions at turns 11 and 12, so it is safe at turn 8.\n- At turn 9, y=6: Freeway 6 has collisions at turns 11 and 12, so it is safe at turn 9.\n- At turn 10, y=7: Freeway 7 has collisions at turns 12, 13, and 14, so it is safe at turn 10.\n- At turn 11, y=8: Freeway 8 has collisions at turns 12, 13, and 14, so it is safe at turn 11.\n- At turn 12, y=9: This is the goal and has no cars, so it is safe.\n\nSince each U action increases y by 1 and no S or D actions are used, \\(H=6\\) is the minimum possible, as any deviation would require additional turns to compensate.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,4) at turn t1=7 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8. The player moves vertically: U for up (y+1), D for down (y-1), S for stay (y same). y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each car, I'm given head, tail, direction, and speed. Direction right means it's moving to the right, so position increases over time. Left-moving would decrease, but in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving based on the data.\n\nLet me list out the cars for each freeway since it's a bit messy:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car: head -42, tail -53, direction right, speed 3. Since direction is right, head should be greater than tail? But here head is -42 and tail is -53, which is less, so tail is at -53, head at -42, so the car spans from -53 to -42? But for right-moving, it should be from lower to higher, so tail is the left end, head is the right end.\n\nThe span is given as (head, tail), but for right-moving, head is the front, so if moving right, head should be on the right. In the update rule, for right-moving, span at time T is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)], which implies that at t1, the span is [τ, h] with τ < h for right-moving.\n\nBut looking at the data: for freeway 1, head = -42, tail = -53. Since tail = -53 and head = -42, and -53 < -42, so τ = -53, h = -42, so [τ, h] = [-53, -42]. Since direction right, it moves right, so at time T, position is [ -53 + s(T-t1), -42 + s(T-t1) ].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on freeway y at that turn, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at time T. That is, if min(span) <= 0 <= max(span).\n\nAlso, note: if the player moves to a different freeway at turn T, they are not on that new freeway until the next turn. Specifically: at turn T, player is on y_T. If action a_T makes y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, then at turn T, player is on y_T, so collision check is for cars on y_T at time T. Then at turn T+1, player is on y_{T+1}, so collision check for cars on y_{T+1} at time T+1.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so even if cars on y_{T+1} have 0 in span at T, it doesn't matter because you're not there yet. You only care about the freeway you're currently on at each turn.\n\nStart at turn t1=7, position y=4.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 are the edges, and no cars on y=0 or y=9, I assume, since freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which is on the top row, probably no cars there, so once at y=9, no collision issues.\n\nNow, the minimal H: since we start at y=4, need to go to y=9, that's 5 steps up if we only go up, but we might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 5.\n\nBut with cars, I might need to delay or change path.\n\nFirst, I need to simulate the car positions over time to see when it's safe to be on each freeway.\n\nTime is in turns, and we start at turn t1=7.\n\nI need to find for each future turn T >=7, for each freeway k, if there is a car such that 0 is in its span at time T.\n\nBecause collision happens only if player is on that freeway at time T and 0 is in some car's span on that freeway at time T.\n\nSo for each k and T, I need to compute if position x=0 is occupied by a car on freeway k at time T.\n\nThat is, for each car, given its state at t1=7, compute its span at time T, and see if 0 is between min and max of that span.\n\nSince multiple cars per freeway, I need to check all cars on that freeway.\n\nLet me list all cars per freeway.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head h = -42, tail τ = -53, direction d = right, speed s = 3.\n\nSince right-moving, at time t, span is [τ + s(t - t1), h + s(t - t1)] = [-53 + 3(t-7), -42 + 3(t-7)]\n\nt1=7, so [ -53 + 3(t-7), -42 + 3(t-7) ]\n\n0 is in span if min <= 0 <= max, so:\n\n-53 + 3(t-7) <= 0 <= -42 + 3(t-7)\n\nLet u = t-7, time offset.\n\nSo -53 + 3u <= 0 <= -42 + 3u\n\nFirst inequality: -53 + 3u <= 0 => 3u <= 53 => u <= 53/3 ≈ 17.666, so u <= 17 since u integer? t is integer, u integer.\n\nu = t - 7, integer.\n\n-53 + 3u <= 0 => 3u <= 53 => u <= 17 since 3*17=51<53, 3*18=54>53? 3u <=53, u integer, u <= floor(53/3)=17? 53/3=17.666, so u <=17 for <=, but let's see.\n\n-53 + 3u <= 0 => 3u <= 53 => u <= 53/3 ≈17.666, so for u<=17, 3u<=51<53? 51<=53 true, but -53+51= -2 <=0 true; u=18, 3*18=54, -53+54=1>0, so -53+3u <=0 only if u <=17? u=17: -53+51= -2 <=0 true; u=18: -53+54=1>0, not <=0.\n\nThe inequality is min <=0, min = -53 +3u\n\n-53 +3u <=0 when 3u <=53, u <= 17 since u integer, 3*17=51<=53, 51<53? 51<53, -53+51=-2<=0 true; 3*18=54>53, -53+54=1>0, so not <=0. So for u<=17, min <=0.\n\nBut min <=0 is always true if min <0, but here min could be negative or positive.\n\nThe condition for 0 in [min,max] is min <=0 and max >=0.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 0 <= -42 +3u => 42 <= 3u => u >= 14 since 3*14=42.\n\nSo for freeway 1 car, 0 in span when u >=14 and u <=17.\n\nThat is, t-7 >=14 and t-7 <=17, so t >=21 and t <=24.\n\nt-7 = u, u>=14 and u<=17, so t >=7+14=21, t<=7+17=24.\n\nSo on freeway 1, at times t=21,22,23,24, there is a car covering x=0.\n\nNow, freeway 2: multiple cars.\n\nCars: (36,25,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nFirst car: head=36, tail=25, direction right, speed=12.\n\nSince right, span at t: [τ + s(t-7), h + s(t-7)] = [25 + 12(t-7), 36 + 12(t-7)]\n\n0 in span if min <=0 <= max\n\nmin = 25 +12u <=0? 25+12u <=0 only if u negative, but u=t-7>=0, so min=25+12u >=25>0, so min>0, thus 0 not <= min since min>0, so 0 cannot be in [min,max] if min>0. Similarly, if max<0, not possible. Here min=25+12u >=25>0, so max> min>0, so 0 not in span. So this car never covers x=0.\n\nSecond car: head=-48? tail=-59? direction right.\n\nHead=-48, tail=-59? So τ=-59, h=-48, since -59<-48.\n\nSpan at t: [τ + s(t-7), h + s(t-7)] = [-59 +12u, -48 +12u] where u=t-7\n\n0 in span if min <=0 <= max\n\nmin = -59 +12u <=0 => 12u <=59 => u <= 59/12 ≈4.916, so u<=4\n\nmax = -48 +12u >=0 => 12u >=48 => u>=4\n\nSo u<=4 and u>=4, so u=4\n\nThus t-7=4, t=11\n\nOnly at t=11, 0 in span for this car.\n\nThird car on freeway 2: head=-12, tail=-23, right, speed=12\n\nτ=-23, h=-12\n\nSpan: [-23 +12u, -12 +12u]\n\n0 in span: min <=0 <= max\n\nmin = -23+12u <=0 => 12u <=23 => u <= 23/12 ≈1.916, u<=1\n\nmax = -12+12u >=0 => 12u >=12 => u>=1\n\nSo u<=1 and u>=1, u=1\n\nt-7=1, t=8\n\nNow, freeway 2 has three cars, but we need if any car covers 0 at time t.\n\nSo for freeway 2:\n\n- At t=8, third car covers 0? u=1, t=8\n\n- At t=11, second car covers 0\n\n- First car never\n\nSo freeway 2 has collision at x=0 when t=8 and t=11.\n\nt=8 and t=11.\n\nNow freeway 3: same as freeway 2? \"3 | (36, 25, right, 12), (-48, -59, right, 12), (-12, -23, right, 12)\" identical to freeway 2.\n\nIn the table, for freeway 2,3,4 all have the same cars? Let me see.\n\nFreeway 2: cars listed as (36,25,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nFreeway 3: same: (36,25,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nFreeway 4: same again.\n\nBut freeway 3 and 4 have same as freeway 2? In the table:\n\n\"2 | (36, 25, right, 12), (-48, -59, right, 12), (-12, -23, right, 12)\"\n\n\"3 | (36, 25, right, 12), (-48, -59, right, 12), (-12, -23, right, 12)\" yes same.\n\n\"4 | (36, 25, right, 12), (-48, -59, right, 12), (-12, -23, right, 12)\" same.\n\nBut that can't be right? Or is it? Perhaps multiple freeways have same car configurations.\n\nIn terms of collision, since we care per freeway, for each freeway, we need to check its cars.\n\nBut for freeway 3, since cars are same as freeway 2, so collision times same: t=8 and t=11.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 4: t=8 and t=11.\n\nNow freeway 5: one car: head=-24, tail=-35, right, speed=6\n\nτ=-35, h=-24\n\nSpan: [-35 +6u, -24 +6u] with u=t-7\n\n0 in span: min <=0 <= max\n\n-35 +6u <=0 => 6u <=35 => u <= 35/6 ≈5.833, u<=5\n\n-24 +6u >=0 => 6u >=24 => u>=4\n\nSo u>=4 and u<=5, thus u=4 or 5\n\nt=7+4=11 or t=7+5=12\n\nSo freeway 5: collision at t=11,12\n\nFreeway 6: same as freeway 5? \"6 | (-24, -35, right, 6)\" yes, identical to freeway 5.\n\nSo freeway 6: collision at t=11,12\n\nFreeway 7: head=-20, tail=-31, right, speed=4\n\nτ=-31, h=-20\n\nSpan: [-31 +4u, -20 +4u]\n\n0 in span: min <=0 <= max\n\n-31 +4u <=0 => 4u <=31 => u <= 31/4=7.75, u<=7\n\n-20 +4u >=0 => 4u >=20 => u>=5\n\nSo u>=5 and u<=7, u=5,6,7\n\nt=7+5=12, 7+6=13, 7+7=14\n\nt=12,13,14\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7? \"8 | (-20, -31, right, 4)\" yes.\n\nSo freeway 8: collision at t=12,13,14\n\nNow, freeway 1 we did: collision at t=21,22,23,24? Earlier.\n\nFreeway 1: t=21,22,23,24\n\nBut we start from t=7, and we want to go to y=9 quickly, so t=21 is far, might not be relevant if we can reach earlier.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway and time when collision at x=0:\n\n- Freeway 1: t=21,22,23,24\n\n- Freeway 2: t=8,11\n\n- Freeway 3: t=8,11 (same as 2)\n\n- Freeway 4: t=8,11 (same)\n\n- Freeway 5: t=11,12\n\n- Freeway 6: t=11,12\n\n- Freeway 7: t=12,13,14\n\n- Freeway 8: t=12,13,14\n\nNow, player starts at y=4 at t=7.\n\nWe need to move to y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nEach turn, we choose action, y changes by +1, -1, or 0.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway when collision happens at that time.\n\nSpecifically, for each turn T, if player is on freeway k at turn T, then k must not have collision at T.\n\nSince freeways y=1 to 8, and y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so no collision there.\n\nAt turn T, player position y_T determines which freeway we're on, except y=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\ny=0: not a freeway, no cars, safe. Similarly y=9.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to 8 with cars.\n\nSo if player at y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nNow, start at t=7, y=4.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nMinimal turns: from y=4 to y=9, need at least 5 U actions, but we might need to wait or go down to avoid bad times.\n\nH is the number of turns from t1, so actions from t=7 to t=7+H-1, and at turn t=7+H-1, y=9.\n\nLet’s denote turn index starting from t=7.\n\nSet τ = 0 at t=7, so time offset.\n\nAt τ=0 (t=7), y=4.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of actions for τ=0 to τ=H-1, such that at step τ=H-1, y=9.\n\ny at step τ is y_{7+τ}.\n\nThe turn when we finish is T = 7 + (H-1), and y_T =9.\n\nSince we start at τ=0, y=4.\n\nAfter H-1 actions, we reach y=9.\n\nThe number of actions is H, from a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, and position after H actions? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t, we perform action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe position is given at turn t, then we choose action a_t, which sets y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nIn the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy based on a_t.\n\nAt turn t, position is (0, y_t).\n\nThen we choose a_t, which sets y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision at turn t is based on y_t and the cars at time t.\n\nIn the collision rule: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, player is at (0, y_T), so on freeway y_T.\n\nThen we check cars on that freeway at time T.\n\nAfter action, we move to new position for next turn.\n\nNow for the sequence: we start at turn t=7, y=4.\n\nWe choose a_7, which sets y_8.\n\nThen at turn t=8, we are at y_8, and so on.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn T, and T should be minimized, so H minimized.\n\nSince we start at t=7, and we want to reach at turn T, then H = T - 7 + 1? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t=7, we are at position.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at t=7, y=4.\n\nAfter 1 action, at t=8, y=8 or whatever.\n\nGenerally, after k actions, we are at turn t=7+k.\n\nPosition at turn t=7+k is after k actions from start.\n\nWe need position at turn t=7 + (H-1) to be y=9, because the sequence has H actions: from t=7 to t=7+H-1.\n\nThe actions are {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nThen the position after these actions, at turn (t1 + H -1) + something? After performing a_{t}, we get y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, we have y_t, then we perform a_t, setting y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at the start, turn t1=7, we have y_{7} =4.\n\nThen we perform a_7, setting y_8.\n\nThen at turn t=8, we have y_8, perform a_8, set y_9, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, we have set y_{t1 + H}.\n\nThe last action is a_{t1 + H -1}, which sets y_{t1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} =9? But the position at turn t_{t1 + H} is (0, y_{t1 + H}).\n\nBut the goal is to reach (0,9), which should be at some turn.\n\nIn the task: \"reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\".\n\nFrom the answer format, we have actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}, and y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAt turn t = t1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nAnd we perform H actions: from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1.\n\nFor example, if H=1, we perform a_{t1}, and at turn t1, position is given, but we set y_{t1+1}, so if H=1, we perform one action a_{t1}, setting y_{t1+1}, but at turn t1+1, position is (0,y_{t1+1}), so to have (0,9) at some turn, with H actions.\n\nIn this case, with H actions, we start at turn t1, and after H actions, we are at turn t1 + H, with position y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut the task says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\".\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\"\n\nIn the sequence: for t from 0 to H-1, a_{t1 + t}, so a_{t1 + 0} to a_{t1 + H-1}, that is a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nThen y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} is the position at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nAt turn t = t1 + H -1, we have y_t =9.\n\nAnd we have performed actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -2} to get to this point, and at this turn, we might perform an action, but the position is already 9.\n\nFor example, start at t=t1, y=4.\n\nAfter first action a_{t1}, we set y_{t1+1}.\n\nAt turn t=t1+1, position is y_{t1+1}.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t=t1+k, position is y_{t1+k}.\n\nWe want at some turn T, y_T=9, with T as small as possible.\n\nThe actions are from a_{t1} to a_{T-1}, because a_{T-1} sets y_T.\n\nThen the number of actions H = T - t1.\n\nBecause from t=t1 to t=T-1, we perform H actions, setting y_{t1+1} to y_T.\n\nAt turn T, we have y_T=9 without performing an action at that turn? At turn T, position is given, we don't perform action for that position.\n\nIn the sequence, actions are performed to set the next position.\n\nSo to reach y_T=9, we need actions from a_{t1} to a_{T-1}, which are H = T - t1 actions.\n\nThen the last action is a_{T-1}, which sets y_T=9.\n\nAnd the position at turn T is (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence given, it should be up to a_{T-1}.\n\nIn the answer format, actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}, and y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSet t1 + H -1 = T, so T = t1 + H -1, thus H = T - t1 +1.\n\nFor example, if we start at t1, and at t1, y=4. If we want to be at y=9 at turn t1, but y=4≠9, so not possible at t1.\n\nIf at turn t1+1, y=9, then we need to set it with a_{t1}, so one action, H=1, T=t1+1.\n\nThen y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{t1 +1 -1} = y_{t1}, but we want y_{t1} =9? No, we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nWith H=1, y_{t1 +1 -1} = y_{t1} =4 ≠9.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nIf we reach at turn T, with y_T=9, then the actions are a_{t1} to a_{T-1}, so the last action is a_{T-1}.\n\nThe number of actions is (T-1) - t1 +1 = T - t1.\n\nIndices from t1 to T-1 inclusive, number is (T-1) - t1 +1 = T - t1.\n\nThen in the sequence, it should be a_{t1} to a_{T-1}, for H = T - t1 actions.\n\nBut in the task, it says {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so for t=0 to H-1, a_{t1 + t}, so a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nAnd y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo y at turn t1 + H -1 is 9.\n\nBut to have y_{t1 + H -1} =9, we need to set it with action a_{t1 + H -2}, for example.\n\nFor turn S = t1 + H -1, y_S =9.\n\nThen the action that sets y_S is a_{S-1}.\n\nS = t1 + H -1, so S-1 = t1 + H -2.\n\nThe actions are from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1} = a_{S}, but a_S sets y_{S+1}, which is after S.\n\nI think there's confusion.\n\nLet me define the turn when we first reach y=9.\n\nSay at turn T, y_T =9.\n\nThen T >= t1 + something.\n\nAt turn t1, y=4.\n\nTo have y_T=9, we need actions a_{t1} to a_{T-1} that change y from 4 to 9.\n\nThe number of actions is K = T - t1.\n\nThen the sequence of actions is a_{t1} to a_{T-1}, which is K actions.\n\nIn the answer, it should be H = K = T - t1, and actions a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1} = a_{t1} to a_{t1 + (T- t1) -1 + t1} no.\n\na_{t1 + H -1} = a_{t1 + (T - t1) -1} = a_{T-1}, which is correct, the last action.\n\nAnd y at turn t1 + H -1 = t1 + (T - t1) -1 +1? t1 + H -1 = t1 + (T - t1) -1 = T -1, but we want y_T=9, not y_{T-1}.\n\nProblem.\n\nt1 + H -1 = t1 + (T - t1) -1 = T -1, and y_{T-1} may not be 9.\n\nBut we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9, so with H = T - t1, t1 + H -1 = T -1, so y_{T-1} =9, but we want to reach at turn T, so at turn T-1, we are already at 9, then at turn T, we might be at 9 or move, but we want to reach at turn T.\n\nI think the task specifies that at turn t1 + H -1, position is (0,9), so we have reached at that turn.\n\nSo for example, if at turn t1, we are at 4, not 9.\n\nIf at turn t1+1, we are at 9, then H should be such that t1 + H -1 = t1+1, so H-1=1, H=2.\n\nThen actions: a_{t1} and a_{t1+1}? But a_{t1} sets y_{t1+1}, a_{t1+1} sets y_{t1+2}, so with H=2 actions, we have a_{t1} and a_{t1+1}, setting y_{t1+1} and y_{t1+2}.\n\nAt turn t1 + H -1 = t1 +2-1 = t1+1, y_{t1+1} is set by a_{t1}, so if we want y_{t1+1}=9, we set it with a_{t1}.\n\nThen at turn t1+1, position is (0,9), and we have performed action a_{t1} (first action), and for the sequence, it includes a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1} = a_{t1} to a_{t1+1}, so two actions, but a_{t1+1} sets y_{t1+2}, which is after we have reached.\n\nBut the position at turn t1+H-1 = t1+1 is already 9.\n\nSimilarly, if we reach at turn T, then set t1 + H -1 = T, so H-1 = T - t1, H = T - t1 +1.\n\nThen actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1} = a_{t1} to a_{T}, since t1 + H -1 = T.\n\na_{T} sets y_{T+1}, which is not needed.\n\nFor example, start at t1, y=4.\n\nTo reach at turn T, y_T=9.\n\nThen we need actions a_{t1} to a_{T-1} to set y_{t1+1} to y_T.\n\nNumber of actions: (T-1) - t1 +1 = T - t1.\n\nThen the turn when we are at 9 is T.\n\nIn the sequence, actions should be a_{t1} to a_{T-1}, H = T - t1 actions.\n\nBut in the format, it has actions up to a_{t1 + H -1} = a_{t1 + (T - t1) -1} = a_{T-1}, and y at t1 + H -1 = t1 + (T - t1) -1 = T-1, but we want y_T=9, not y_{T-1}.\n\nUnless we are at y=9 at turn T-1, but that might not be the case.\n\nI think there's a mistake in the task or my understanding.\n\nPerhaps \"reach (0,9)\" means that at the turn when we perform the last action, we arrive at 9.\n\nBut the position is after the action.\n\nLet's look back at the task.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9), avoiding collisions... such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\"\n\nAnd \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\"\n\nSo it is specified that at turn t1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nFor example, at turn S = t1 + H -1, y_S =9.\n\nThen to have that, we must have reached y=9 at or before turn S.\n\nSince we start at t1, y=4, we need to change y from 4 to 9 over the turns.\n\nThe actions a_{t1} to a_{S-1} set the position from t1 to S.\n\nAt turn t1, position y_t1.\n\nAction a_t1 sets y_{t1+1}.\n\nAt turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1}, and so on.\n\nAt turn S, position y_S.\n\nTo have y_S =9, we need the actions before to have set it.\n\nThe actions in the sequence are a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1} = a_S, since S = t1 + H -1, so a_S sets y_{S+1}, which is not related to y_S.\n\nI think it's inconsistent.\n\nPerhaps the actions are for the current turn position.\n\nIn the game dynamics, at each turn t, we are at position, then we choose action a_t, which determines the next position, and collision is checked at current position.\n\nFor the sequence, we provide actions for turns from t1 to t1+H-1, and at turn t1+H-1, position is 9.\n\nFor turn t1+H-1, we are at position 9, so we have already arrived.\n\nThe action at that turn might be S or something, but we are already there.\n\nTo reach at turn T, with y_T=9, then we need to have that at turn T, we are at 9, and the actions to get there are from a_{t1} to a_{T-1}, for H = T - t1 actions.\n\nThen for the sequence, it should be a_{t1} to a_{T-1}, and H = T - t1.\n\nBut in the format, a_{t1 + H -1} = a_{t1 + (T - t1) -1} = a_{T-1}, which is correct, and y at t1 + H -1 = t1 + (T - t1) -1 = T-1, but we want y_T=9, not y_{T-1}.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} = y_{T-1}, which should be 9 only if we reach at T-1.\n\nI think there's a misalignment.\n\nPerhaps for the turn t1 + H -1, position is 9, so we reach at that turn.\n\nSo let's set S = t1 + H -1, y_S =9.\n\nThen for example, if we reach at turn t1+1, y=9, then S = t1+1, so t1 + H -1 = t1+1, thus H-1=1, H=2.\n\nThen actions: a_{t1} and a_{t1+1}.\n\na_{t1} sets y_{t1+1} =9, so at turn t1+1, position is 9.\n\nThen a_{t1+1} sets y_{t1+2}, which could be 9 or something else, but we don't care, as long as at turn S=t1+1, we are at 9.\n\nSimilarly, if we reach at turn T, then S=T, so t1 + H -1 = T, H = T - t1 +1.\n\nThen actions from a_{t1} to a_{T}, which sets y_{T+1}, but at turn T, we are at y_T=9, set by a_{T-1}.\n\nThe action a_T is performed at turn T, but it sets y_{T+1}, not affecting y_T.\n\nFor collision, at turn T, we are at y_T=9, no collision.\n\nThen a_T could be U, D, S, but since we are at 9, U would go to 10, but y max 9, so probably not allowed, or capped, but in the move, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with y in [0,9], so if at 9, U might be invalid or capped to 9, but I think it's capped, so U or S both keep y=9 or set to 9 if at 8, etc.\n\nBut in this case, for reaching, at turn S, y_S=9, and we perform action a_S, which sets y_{S+1}, but that's after.\n\nFor the sequence, it includes a_S, which is not necessary for reaching, but it is part of the sequence for that turn.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to reach as soon as possible, so we can assume that once at 9, we stay or something, but we need to provide actions for H turns.\n\nBut H includes turns after reaching, which might not be minimal.\n\nFor example, to reach at turn T, with H = T - t1 +1 actions, we have one extra action at turn T.\n\nBut since we can choose S at that turn, it doesn't change position, so it's fine, but H is larger than necessary.\n\nTo have minimal H, we should reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nSo for example, to reach at turn T, set T = t1 + H -1, so H = T - t1 +1.\n\nThen at turn T, y_T=9.\n\nWith actions from a_{t1} to a_{T-1} setting the path, and a_T is also in the sequence, but a_T sets y_{T+1}, which is after.\n\nBut for the position at T, it's set by previous actions.\n\nIn terms of collision, at turn T, we are at y_T=9, safe.\n\nThen a_T can be S to stay or whatever.\n\nBut for minimal H, since H = T - t1 +1, and T is the turn we reach, to minimize H, we need to minimize T, the reach turn.\n\nBecause H = T - t1 +1, so min H means min T.\n\nSimilarly, if we reach later, T larger, H larger.\n\nSo minimizing H is the same as minimizing the turn when we first reach y=9.\n\nWe need to find the earliest turn T such that we can be at y=9 at turn T, with no collision on the way.\n\nStart from t=7, y=4.\n\nWe need to go to y=9, net +5 in y.\n\nEach U increases y by 1, D decreases, S same.\n\nWe need the number of U minus number of D to be 5.\n\nThe path must avoid being on a freeway when it has collision at that turn.\n\nNow, from the collision times:\n\nFreeway 2,3,4 have collision at t=8 and t=11.\n\nFreeway 5,6 at t=11,12.\n\nFreeway 7,8 at t=12,13,14.\n\nFreeway 1 at t=21-24, far away.\n\nt=7 is current turn.\n\nAt t=7, we are at y=4.\n\nFreeway 4 has cars, but at t=7, is there collision on y=4?\n\nWe need to check for each turn and freeway if collision at that time.\n\nFirst, for t=7, u=0.\n\nFreeway 1: u=0, min = -53 +0 = -53, max = -42 +0 = -42, both negative, 0 not in span, no collision.\n\nFreeway 2: cars, at u=0, t=7.\n\nFirst car: min=25+0=25>0, no.\n\nSecond car: min=-59+0=-59, max=-48+0=-48, both negative, 0 not in, no.\n\nThird car: min=-23+0=-23, max=-12+0=-12, both negative, no. So no collision on freeway 2 at t=7.\n\nSimilarly freeway 3 and 4 same as 2, no collision at t=7.\n\nFreeway 5: min=-35+0=-35, max=-24+0=-24, both negative, no.\n\nFreeway 6 same.\n\nFreeway 7: min=-31+0=-31, max=-20+0=-20, both negative, no.\n\nFreeway 8 same.\n\nSo at t=7, on y=4, no collision.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\nPossible to go directly up, but we need to check the freeways at the times we are on them.\n\nLet's list the critical times.\n\nCollision times per freeway:\n\ny=1: collision at t=21,22,23,24 (far)\n\ny=2: t=8,11\n\ny=3: t=8,11\n\ny=4: t=8,11\n\ny=5: t=11,12\n\ny=6: t=11,12\n\ny=7: t=12,13,14\n\ny=8: t=12,13,14\n\nWe start at t=7, y=4.\n\nTo reach y=9, we need to pass through y=5,6,7,8 or go directly.\n\nBut we can stay or move down, but that might increase time.\n\nSince we want min time, probably go up as much as possible, but avoid being on a freeway at bad times.\n\nFor example, at t=7, we are on y=4, safe.\n\nNow, we choose action for t=7.\n\nIf we go up, to y=5 at t=8.\n\nAt t=8, y=5.\n\nBut on freeway y=5, collision at t=11 and 12, not at t=8? t=8 is not in {11,12} for y=5, so safe? y=5 collision at t=11,12, so at t=8, no collision on y=5.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down to y=3 at t=8, but y=3 has collision at t=8 and 11, so at t=8, on y=3, collision.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 at t=8 has collision because y=4 collision at t=8.\n\ny=4 freeway collision at t=8 and 11.\n\nSo at t=8, if on y=4, collision; on y=3, collision; on y=5, no collision.\n\ny=2 also collision at t=8.\n\nSo at t=8, only safe freeways are y=1,5,6,7,8? Let's list which freeways have collision at t=8.\n\nt=8: u=1\n\ny=2: collision yes\n\ny=3: yes\n\ny=4: yes\n\ny=1: no, t=8 not 21-24\n\ny=5: collision at t=11,12, not 8, no\n\ny=6: no\n\ny=7: collision at t=12,13,14, not 8, no\n\ny=8: no\n\nSo at t=8, freeways with collision: y=2,3,4\n\nSafe: y=1,5,6,7,8\n\nSimilarly, at other times.\n\nNow back to t=7, y=4.\n\nWe choose a_7.\n\nOptions: U, D, S.\n\nIf S, stay at y=4 for t=8, but at t=8, y=4 has collision, so not safe.\n\nIf D, go down to y=3 at t=8, but y=3 has collision at t=8, also not safe.\n\nIf U, go up to y=5 at t=8, and y=5 is safe at t=8, as above.\n\nSo only choice is to go up to y=5 at t=8.\n\nSo a_7 = U.\n\nThen at t=8, y=5.\n\nNow, at t=8, we are on y=5, safe.\n\nNow choose action for t=8.\n\nOptions: U to y=6, D to y=4, S stay y=5.\n\nFirst, if S, stay at y=5 for t=9.\n\nAt t=9, what about y=5? Collision on y=5 at t=11,12, not at t=9, so safe? Need to check if collision at t=9 for y=5.\n\nFrom earlier, y=5 collision only at t=11,12, so at t=9, no collision, safe.\n\nSimilarly, if U to y=6 at t=9.\n\ny=6 collision at t=11,12, not t=9, safe.\n\nIf D to y=4 at t=9.\n\nAt t=9, y=4: collision at t=8 and 11, t=9 not collision? t=8 and t=11, so at t=9, no collision on y=4.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut we want to go up, so probably U or S.\n\nBut S might delay.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9, so from y=5, we need to go up.\n\nNow, future times: t=9,10,11,etc.\n\nAt t=11, y=5 and y=6 have collision.\n\ny=5 at t=11,12; y=6 at t=11,12.\n\nAlso y=2,3,4 at t=11.\n\nBut we are at y=5 at t=8.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=5 or y=6 at t=11 and t=12.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 and y=8 at t=12,13,14.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nFrom t=8, y=5.\n\nIf we go up to y=6 at t=9, then to y=7 at t=10, then to y=8 at t=11, but at t=11, if on y=8, y=8 collision at t=12,13,14, not at t=11, so at t=11, on y=8 is safe.\n\ny=8 collision at t=12,13,14, so at t=11, no collision.\n\nSimilarly, at t=10, etc.\n\nLet's plan the path.\n\nOption 1: go up as fast as possible.\n\nStart t=7, y=4, a=U, to y=5 at t=8.\n\nt=8, y=5, a=U, to y=6 at t=9.\n\nt=9, y=6, a=U, to y=7 at t=10.\n\nt=10, y=7, a=U, to y=8 at t=11.\n\nNow at t=11, y=8.\n\ny=8 at t=11: collision? y=8 collision at t=12,13,14, not t=11, so safe.\n\nThen t=11, a=U, to y=9 at t=12.\n\nAt t=12, y=9, which is safe, no cars.\n\nBut we reach at t=12, y=9.\n\nNow, check for collision during the path.\n\nt=7: y=4, safe as before.\n\nt=8: y=5, safe, no collision at t=8.\n\nt=9: y=6, need to check if collision at t=9 on y=6.\n\ny=6 collision at t=11,12, not t=9, so safe.\n\nt=10: y=7, y=7 collision at t=12,13,14, not t=10, safe.\n\nt=11: y=8, safe as above.\n\nt=12: y=9, safe.\n\nSo with this, we reach y=9 at t=12.\n\nH: we start at t=7, actions from a7 to a?.\n\nAt turn t=12, y=9.\n\nSo we reached at turn T=12.\n\nThen number of actions: from a7 to a11, since a11 sets y12=9.\n\nActions: a7, a8, a9, a10, a11: 5 actions.\n\nH: number of turns? In the sequence, from t=0 to H-1 for the index, but here t from 7 to 11, that's 5 actions.\n\nH such that actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, and y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nHere t1=7, y at turn S=12 should be 9.\n\nS = t1 + H -1 =12\n\n7 + H -1 =12, so H-1=5, H=6.\n\nThen actions from a7 to a_{7+6-1}=a12? a_{t1 + H -1} = a_{7+5} = a12? H=6, a_{7+6-1}=a12.\n\nBut a12 sets y13, not y12.\n\nPosition at t1+H-1=7+6-1=12, y12 should be 9, set by a11.\n\nSo actions should include a7 to a11 for H=5 actions? But H=5, t1+H-1=7+5-1=11, y11 should be 9.\n\nBut in this case, at t=11, y=8, not 9.\n\nAt t=12, y=9.\n\nSo for y_{t1+H-1} to be 9, with H=5, t1+H-1=11, y11=8≠9.\n\nWith H=6, t1+H-1=12, y12=9, good.\n\nBut actions from a7 to a12, a12 sets y13, which is not needed, but we can set a12=S or something.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to provide actions up to a_{t1+H-1}, which for H=6, up to a12.\n\nBut to reach at t=12, we only need actions up to a11.\n\na12 is extra.\n\nBut since we are at y=9 at t=12, we can do a12=S to stay, so y13=9, but we don't care.\n\nSimilarly, in general, to reach at turn T, we set H = T - t1 +1, and actions from a_{t1} to a_{T}, with a_{T} being S or something to not move, but since y_T=9, a_T=S is fine.\n\nThen y_{t1+H-1} = y_{t1 + (T - t1 +1) -1} = y_T =9, good.\n\nAnd actions include a_{t1} to a_{T}.\n\nFor T=12, H=12-7+1=6 actions: a7 to a12.\n\nIn the sequence, a7 to a12, with a7 to a11 setting the path to y12=9, and a12=S to stay or whatever.\n\nBut in the action list, we need to specify.\n\nNow back to the path.\n\nIn the direct up path: we go U at t=7 to y5 at t=8\n\nU at t=8 to y6 at t=9\n\nU at t=9 to y7 at t=10\n\nU at t=10 to y8 at t=11\n\nU at t=11 to y9 at t=12\n\nThen at t=12, y9, we need to provide action for t=12, say S.\n\nBut we reach at t=12.\n\nH=6.\n\nBut can we reach earlier?\n\nFrom y=4 at t=7, we went to y5 at t=8.\n\nAt t=8, we are at y5.\n\nIf at t=8, we go U to y6 at t=9.\n\nBut is there a way to be at y9 before t=12?\n\nFor example, if we could be at higher y earlier, but we start at y4, min turns to y9 is 5, but with constraints.\n\nAt t=7, only choice is U to y5 at t=8, as D or S lead to collision at t=8 on y4 or y3.\n\nAt t=8, y5, we can go U to y6 at t=9.\n\nThen at t=9, y6, we can go U to y7 at t=10.\n\nAt t=10, y7, we can go U to y8 at t=11.\n\nAt t=11, y8, we go U to y9 at t=12.\n\nNo way to go faster, since each step takes one turn.\n\nBut at t=11, we are at y8, and we go to y9 at t=12.\n\nBut at t=11, on y8, is it safe? Yes, as collision at t=12,13,14, not 11.\n\nBut we could consider staying or something, but it doesn't help to go faster.\n\nPerhaps go down to avoid, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if at some point we go down, it increases the number of turns.\n\nSo minimal should be reach at t=12.\n\nBut let's check if we can be at y9 earlier.\n\nSuppose at t=7, we go U to y5 at t=8.\n\nAt t=8, instead of U, we go S, stay at y5 for t=9.\n\nThen at t=9, y5, we go U to y6 at t=10.\n\nThen U to y7 at t=11.\n\nAt t=11, on y7, but y7 collision at t=12,13,14, not t=11, so safe.\n\nThen U to y8 at t=12.\n\nBut at t=12, on y8, collision! y8 collision at t=12,13,14, so at t=12, on y8, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nIn this case, if we stay at t=8, then at t=12, we are on y8, which has collision.\n\nIf we go U from t=8 to y6 at t=9, then to y7 at t=10, to y8 at t=11 (safe), to y9 at t=12.\n\nAt t=12, y9 safe.\n\nIf we go faster, but we can't.\n\nAnother option: from t=8 y5, go U to y6 t=9.\n\nThen at t=9, go U to y7 t=10.\n\nThen at t=10, go U to y8 t=11.\n\nThen U to y9 t=12.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAt t=10, y7, if we go U to y8 t=11.\n\nBut at t=11, y8 safe.\n\nCould we go directly to y9 from y7? No, must go through y8.\n\nUnless we can jump, but no, only ±1 or 0.\n\nSo min reach at t=12.\n\nBut earlier I thought about t=11.\n\nAt t=11, we are at y8 in this path, not y9.\n\nCan we be at y9 at t=11?\n\nFrom start: t=7 y4.\n\nAfter one action, t=8, y5 max.\n\nt=9, y6 max.\n\nt=10, y7 max.\n\nt=11, y8 max. Cannot reach y9 before t=12.\n\nt=7: y4\n\nt=8: after a7, y5\n\nt=9: after a8, y6\n\nt=10: after a9, y7\n\nt=11: after a10, y8\n\nt=12: after a11, y9\n\nSo earliest at t=12.\n\nNow, in the path, we need to make sure no collision.\n\nIn the sequence: t=7 y4: safe\n\na7=U, to y5 at t=8\n\nt=8 y5: safe, as collision only at t=11,12\n\na8=U, to y6 at t=9\n\nt=9 y6: safe, collision at t=11,12, not 9\n\na9=U, to y7 at t=10\n\nt=10 y7: safe, collision at t=12,13,14, not 10\n\na10=U, to y8 at t=11\n\nt=11 y8: safe, collision at t=12,13,14, not 11\n\na11=U, to y9 at t=12\n\nt=12 y9: safe\n\nNow, for H, we reach at t=12, so T=12, t1=7, H= T - t1 +1 =12-7+1=6 actions.\n\nActions from a7 to a12? a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1} = a_{7} to a_{7+6-1} = a_{12}\n\na12 sets y13, but at turn t=12, we are at y12=9, set by a11.\n\na12 is for turn t=12, which sets y13.\n\nSince we are at y12=9, we can set a12=S, so y13=9, but we don't care.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to provide a12.\n\nSimilarly, for the answer.\n\nBut in the actions, a7 to a11 are U, and a12 can be S.\n\nBut we can set a12 to anything, but S is fine.\n\nNow, but at t=11, we are at y8, which is safe, but y8 has collision at t=12, so if we stayed on y8 at t=12, collision, but we move to y9 at t=12, so at t=12, we are on y9, not y8.\n\nAt turn t=12, position is y12=9, so on y9, no collision.\n\nThen a12=S to stay.\n\nNow, but in the sequence for H=6.\n\nPerhaps we can have a shorter H if we reach earlier, but we can't.\n\nAnother thing: at t=7, we must go U, but what if we go down? But that would be worse.\n\nFor example, at t=7, go D to y3 at t=8, but at t=8, y3 has collision, not possible.\n\nS to y4 at t=8, collision, not possible.\n\nSo only U.\n\nThen proceed as above.\n\nBut at t=11, we go to y9 at t=12.\n\nBut let's confirm the collision at t=11 for other freeways.\n\nFor example, at t=11, freeways with collision: y=2,3,4,5,6 all have collision at t=11.\n\ny=2,3,4 at t=8 and 11, y=5,6 at t=11,12.\n\nBut we are on y=8 at t=11, which is safe.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSimilarly, earlier times.\n\nSo path is fine.\n\nBut we need to output the actions.\n\nH=6, actions: a7=U, a8=U, a9=U, a10=U, a11=U, a12=S\n\nBut a12=S to stay at y9.\n\nIn the sequence, it should be for turns from t=7 to t=12.\n\nBut t=12 is turn 12, which is t1 + H -1 =7+6-1=12.\n\ny at turn 12 is 9.\n\nNow, but in the action list.\n\nPerhaps we can have H smaller if we reach at t=11, but impossible.\n\nUnless we start from higher, but no.\n\nAnother point: at t=10, we are at y7.\n\ny7 has collision at t=12,13,14.\n\nAt t=10, safe.\n\nIf we could go directly to y9, but no.\n\nPerhaps go down to avoid, but not necessary.\n\nFor example, suppose at t=9, y6, instead of going to y7 at t=10, we go down to y5 at t=10, but then at t=10, y5, safe? t=10 not 11 or 12, so safe, but then we are lower, need to go up later, which might hit bad times.\n\nFor example, if at t=9 y6, go D to y5 at t=10.\n\nt=10 y5, safe.\n\nThen at t=10, go U to y6 at t=11.\n\nBut at t=11, y6, collision! y6 collision at t=11,12, so at t=11 on y6, collision.\n\nNot safe.\n\nIf at t=10 y5, go S to y5 at t=11, collision at t=11.\n\nGo U to y6 at t=11, collision.\n\nSo not possible to be on y5 or y6 at t=11.\n\nTherefore, from t=10, we need to be at y7 or higher to avoid t=11 collision on lower freeways.\n\nIn the direct path, we are at y7 at t=10, then y8 at t=11, both safe.\n\ny7 at t=10 safe, y8 at t=11 safe.\n\nThen to y9 at t=12.\n\nAt t=12, y9 safe.\n\nIf we go to y7 at t=10, then stay at y7 for t=11, but at t=11, y7: collision? y7 collision at t=12,13,14, not t=11, so safe.\n\nThen at t=11, go U to y8 at t=12.\n\nBut at t=12, on y8, collision! y8 collision at t=12.\n\nSo if we are on y8 at t=12, collision.\n\nTherefore, we must not be on y8 at t=12.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be on y7 at t=12, etc.\n\nIn the path, we move from y8 at t=11 to y9 at t=12, so at t=12, on y9, not y8.\n\nIf we stay at y7 at t=11, then at t=12, if we go to y8, on y8 at t=12, collision.\n\nIf we go directly to y9 from y7, but cannot, must go to y8 first.\n\nSo the only way is to be on y8 at a time when no collision, like t=11, and then move to y9 at t=12.\n\nCannot be on y8 at t=12.\n\nSimilarly for other.\n\nTherefore, the path I have is fine.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn t=7: U\n\nTurn t=8: U\n\nTurn t=9: U\n\nTurn t=10: U\n\nTurn t=11: U\n\nThen for t=12, since we need action, and we are at y9, so S or U, but U might go to 10, capped? The move: y_{t+1} = min(max(y_t + Δy, 0),9), I assume, so at y=9, U or D or S all keep y=9 or set to 9.\n\nSo we can set a12=S.\n\nThen H=6.\n\nBut in the sequence, for H=6, actions from a7 to a12.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 1 has cars, but we didn't use it, and times are late.\n\nNow, but let's confirm if we can reach with H=5.\n\nIf H=5, then t1+H-1=7+5-1=11, so y at turn 11 should be 9.\n\nBut from start, at t=7 y4, after actions, at t=11, y11.\n\nMinimal y at t=11: if all U, from t=8 to t=11: t=8 y5, t=9 y6, t=10 y7, t=11 y8, cannot be y9 at t=11.\n\nMax at t=11 is y8.\n\nSo impossible to have y11=9.\n\nThus minimal H is 6, reaching at t=12.\n\nNow, for the actions: a7=U, a8=U, a9=U, a10=U, a11=U, a12=S\n\nBut a12=S is for staying, but since we are at y9, it's fine.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to specify.\n\nPerhaps we can have a11=U to go to y9 at t=12, and no a12, but H=6 requires a12.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be clear.\n\nNow, but let's list the turns.\n\nCurrent turn is t1=7.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: S  (to stay at y9)\n\nThen y at turn 12 is 9.\n\nNow, for freeway 8, we have cars, but at t=11, we are on y8, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 7 and 8 have cars, but we are not on them at collision times for us.\n\nAnother thing: the note about moving to different freeway.\n\nIn this case, we move each turn except last.\n\nBut no issue.\n\nSo I think this is minimal.\n\nBut earlier I thought about freeway 1, but not relevant.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=1 or something, but that would take more turns to go up from there, worse.\n\nFor example, at t=7, if we could go to y=1, but we are at y=4, going down to y=1 takes 3 down actions, then up to 9, more turns.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo minimal H=6.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nH=6\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn t_1: U  (t1=7)\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: U  (t=8)\n\nTurn t_1 + 2: U  (t=9)\n\nTurn t_1 + 3: U  (t=10)\n\nTurn t_1 + 4: U  (t=11)\n\nTurn t_1 + 5: S  (t=12)  // since t_1 + H -1 = t1 +5? H=6, t from 0 to 5, t_1 + t for t=0 to 5.\n\nt_1 + t for t=0: t1, t=1: t1+1, ..., t=5: t1+5.\n\nt1+5 =7+5=12.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd action at t1+5: S\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's write the actions.\n\nAlso, in the car state, freeway 2,3,4 have multiple cars, but we handled.\n\nNow, but for freeway 4 at t=8, we were not on it, since we moved to y=5.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think fine.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 4)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 7\\) is 6, with the sequence of actions achieving this in the fewest turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\).\n\n### Collision Analysis and Path Justification\n- **Initial Position (Turn 7, y=4)**: Safe, as no collision occurs on freeway 4 at turn 7.\n- **Action at Turn 7 (U)**: Move to y=5 at turn 8. Freeway 5 has no collision at turn 8 (collision only at turns 11 and 12), so safe.\n- **Action at Turn 8 (U)**: Move to y=6 at turn 9. Freeway 6 has no collision at turn 9 (collision only at turns 11 and 12), so safe.\n- **Action at Turn 9 (U)**: Move to y=7 at turn 10. Freeway 7 has no collision at turn 10 (collision only at turns 12, 13, and 14), so safe.\n- **Action at Turn 10 (U)**: Move to y=8 at turn 11. Freeway 8 has no collision at turn 11 (collision only at turns 12, 13, and 14), so safe.\n- **Action at Turn 11 (U)**: Move to y=9 at turn 12. Position (0,9) is reached, and y=9 has no cars, so safe.\n- **Action at Turn 12 (S)**: Stay at y=9 (required for the sequence length \\(H=6\\); no collision as y=9 is safe.\n\nReaching y=9 earlier (e.g., by turn 11) is impossible because:\n- From y=4 at turn 7, the maximum achievable y by turn 11 is y=8 (with all U actions: y=5 at t=8, y=6 at t=9, y=7 at t=10, y=8 at t=11).\n- Being on freeways 5 or 6 at turn 11 causes collision (as both have collision at turn 11), so deviating (e.g., moving down) would require more turns or cause collision.\n\nThus, the sequence minimizes \\(H\\) and avoids all collisions.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe actions are for turns \\(t_1 + t\\) where \\(t = 0\\) to \\(H-1 = 5\\), so turns 7 to 12.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U \\\\\nTurn 12: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,6) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 through 8. The current turn is t1 = 9, but I think that's a typo; it says t0=9, but I'll use t=9 as the starting turn.\n\nThe player moves vertically: up (U) increases y by 1, down (D) decreases y by 1, or stay (S) keeps y the same. y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars are on each freeway y=1 to 8, and they move horizontally. For collision, it happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 (the x-position) is within the car's span at that turn.\n\nImportant point: when you move to a new y, you're not on that new y until the next turn. So if at turn T, you decide to move to y_{T+1}, you are still on y_T during turn T, and only on y_{T+1} starting turn T+1. So for collision at turn T, it only considers the freeway y_T, and whether 0 is in the car span for that freeway at turn T.\n\nThe car spans move left or right based on their direction and speed. Left-moving: span decreases in x, right-moving: span increases in x.\n\nFor example, a right-moving car with span [τ, h] at t1, at time T, it's [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but in this case, all cars seem to be right-moving? Let me check the car states.\n\nFreeway 1: (-36, -47, right, 3) — head and tail, but for right-moving, head should be greater than tail? -36 > -47? -36 is greater than -47, yes, since -36 is to the right. So head h = -36, tail τ = -47, direction right, speed 3.\n\nIn the notation, for right-moving, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), and head is the front, so for right-moving, head > tail.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2: (60,49,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12), (12,1,right,12) — all right-moving.\n\nSimilarly for 3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nFreeway 5: (-12,-23,right,6) — head -12, tail -23, both negative, but -12 > -23, so right-moving.\n\nSimilarly for others. All cars are right-moving.\n\nAlso, for freeways 2,3,4, there are multiple cars, but for collision, we care if 0 is in any car's span on the freeway we're on at that turn.\n\nNow, I need to get from y=6 to y=9 in min turns.\n\nSince we start at y=6, and want to go to y=9, we need to move up at least 3 times. But we might need to stay or move down to avoid collisions, so H could be more than 3.\n\nBut min H should be as small as possible, so ideally H=3 if no collisions, but we have to check for collisions on the way.\n\nWe start at turn t=9, position y=6.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn T, meaning after H-1 actions? Let's see.\n\nDefine: at turn t, we are at position (0, y_t)\n\nAfter action a_t, we move to y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and that happens for t from t1 to t1+H-1? The sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so actions at times t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nThen after H actions, we have y_{t1+H}, and we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9? Let's read carefully.\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\"\n\nThe player position at turn t is (0, y_t)\n\nAfter actions from t1 to t1+H-1, we have positions from y_{t1} to y_{t1+H}\n\nWe want y_{t1+H-1} = 9? No.\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\"\n\nLet's parse the indices.\n\nThe actions are for turns t1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter these actions, the position is updated: after a_{t1}, we have y_{t1+1}, after a_{t1+1}, y_{t1+2}, ..., after a_{t1+H-1}, we have y_{t1+H}.\n\nAnd we want to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1? That doesn't make sense.\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\"\n\nBut at turn t1 + H - 1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}, and after action a_{t1+H-1}, we go to y_{t1+H}, but we want to be at (0,9) at some turn.\n\nI think there's confusion in the indexing.\n\nLet me read the problem again.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nBut in the action sequence, after H actions, we have H new positions, from y_{t1+1} to y_{t1+H}.\n\nLet t_start = t1 = 9.\n\nAt turn t_start, position y_{t_start} = 6.\n\nWe apply actions a_{t_start}, a_{t_start+1}, ..., a_{t_start+H-1}\n\nThen the position after k actions is y_{t_start + k} for k=1 to H.\n\nWe want that at some turn, we are at y=9.\n\nSpecifically, at turn t_start + H - 1, we are at (0,9).\n\nturn t_start + H - 1 is the turn when we are at position, and after action at that turn, we might move, but the position at that turn is what matters for collision, and we want to be at y=9 at that turn.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nAt each turn t, we are at position (0, y_t), and we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision is checked at turn t based on y_t and the cars on freeway y_t at time t.\n\nThen, we want that at turn t = t_start + H - 1, y_t = 9.\n\nFor t from t_start to t_start + H - 2, we are not at y=9, but at t_start + H - 1, we are at y=9.\n\nAnd during all turns from t_start to t_start + H - 1, we must not collide, meaning for each turn t in [t_start, t_start + H - 1], at position y_t, for freeway k = y_t, at time t, 0 is not in any car span on that freeway.\n\nThen for the action sequence, we have actions from t_start to t_start + H - 2? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe actions are for t = t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1, so H actions.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at t1, position y_{t1}.\n\nAfter 1 action, at t1+1, y_{t1+1}.\n\n...\nAfter H actions, at t1+H, y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo the position at turn t1+H-1 is 9, which is set by the action at t1+H-2? Let's think of the turns.\n\nList the turns and positions:\n\n- Turn t: position y_t, choose action a_t\n\n- Then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy from a_t\n\nFor turn t, collision depends on y_t and cars at time t.\n\nWe start at turn t1, y_{t1} = 6.\n\nWe want at some turn T, y_T = 9, with T = t1 + H - 1.\n\nThe actions are from turn t1 to turn t1 + H - 1, but at turn t1 + H - 1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}, and we choose a_{t1+H-1}, which moves us to y_{t1+H}, but we don't care about y_{t1+H} as long as at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nAlso, for collision, at turn t1+H-1, we need to be safe at y=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1+H-1, but the position at turn t1+H-1 is before the action a_{t1+H-1} is applied? No.\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t, then we choose a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nFor collision at turn t, it depends on y_t and the cars at time t.\n\nSo for each turn from t1 to T, where T is when we reach y=9, we need no collision at that turn.\n\nIn this case, T = t1 + H - 1.\n\nThe actions are from t1 to T, so H actions, but from t1 to t1+H-1, that's H turns for actions, but the positions are from y_{t1} to y_{t1+H}, with y_{t1+H-1} = 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nThe turns with positions are t1 to t1+H-1, and actions at those turns affect the next position.\n\nFor collision, we care about turns t1 to t1+H-1, each with y_t.\n\nThe action at turn t affects y_{t+1}, but for collision at turn t, it depends on y_t, not on the action.\n\nSo for the period from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1, we have positions y_t for t from t1 to t1+H-1, and we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9, and for each t in [t1, t1+H-1], no collision at (y_t, t).\n\nActions a_t for t from t1 to t1+H-2 determine the moves from y_t to y_{t+1} for t from t1 to t1+H-2, and a_{t1+H-1} is chosen but since we are at y=9 at turn t1+H-1, and we might stay or move, but since we are already at 9, moving up or down would take us away, so probably we should stay or something, but we can move, but for reaching, we just need to be at 9 at that turn, and we can take action to go elsewhere, but the problem is to reach at that turn, so after that, it doesn't matter.\n\nBut for min H, we want to reach as soon as possible, so H min means we reach at turn t1+H-1 with min H.\n\nH is the number of turns from start to reach, including the start or not?\n\nt1+H-1 - t1 + 1 = H turns from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nNumber of turns elapsed is (t1+H-1) - t1 + 1 = H turns.\n\nBut at turn t1, we are at y=6, not 9, so we need to move to y=9 in fewer than H turns.\n\nSince we start at t1, y=6, and we want to be at y=9 at turn T = t1 + H - 1.\n\nThe number of actions taken is H, from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nEach action changes the position, except stay.\n\nThe net displacement must be +3, from 6 to 9.\n\nMin H is at least 3, if we can move up three times without collision.\n\nBut we need to check if at each step, when we are on a freeway, there is no car covering x=0 at that turn.\n\nNow, the freeways are from y=1 to 8, and y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I assume no cars there, so no collision possible at y=0 or y=9.\n\nThe problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\", so at y=0 and y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nWe start at y=6, which is a freeway, so we need to check collision at turn t1=9 for y=6.\n\nSimilarly, when moving, if we go to y=7,8, etc.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, which is safe.\n\nSince we need to go up from 6 to 9, we will pass through y=7 and y=8, or stay, but min time, we go directly if possible.\n\nBut we might need to stay or move down to avoid cars.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars for each freeway at time t.\n\nCurrent turn t1 = 9.\n\nFor each freeway k, and car, we have the span at t=9.\n\nThen at time T, the span is moved based on speed and direction.\n\nAll cars right-moving, so for a car with head h, tail τ at t=9, at time T, head is h + s*(T-9), tail is τ + s*(T-9), and span is [τ + s*(T-9), h + s*(T-9)] since right-moving, head > tail.\n\nThen collision on freeway k at time T if y_T = k and 0 is in [τ + s*(T-9), h + s*(T-9)] for some car on k.\n\nSince the car is on freeway k, and we are on k at time T.\n\nNow, let's list for each freeway the cars at t=9.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: h = -36, τ = -47, s = 3, right\n\nAt time T, span: [ -47 + 3*(T-9) , -36 + 3*(T-9) ]\n\nCollision if 0 in this interval, so -47 + 3(T-9) <= 0 <= -36 + 3(T-9)\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2: three cars:\n\nFirst car: (60,49,right,12) so h=60, τ=49, s=12\n\nAt T: [49 + 12(T-9), 60 + 12(T-9)]\n\nSecond car: (-24,-35,right,12) h=-24, τ=-35, s=12\n\nAt T: [-35 + 12(T-9), -24 + 12(T-9)]\n\nThird car: (12,1,right,12) h=12, τ=1, s=12\n\nAt T: [1 + 12(T-9), 12 + 12(T-9)]\n\nFreeway 3: same as freeway 2? Let's see:\n\nFreeway 3: (60,49,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12), (12,1,right,12) — identical to freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 4: same: (60,49,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12), (12,1,right,12) — all same.\n\nFreeway 5: one car: (-12,-23,right,6) h=-12, τ=-23, s=6\n\nAt T: [-23 + 6(T-9), -12 + 6(T-9)]\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5? (-12,-23,right,6) — yes, identical.\n\nFreeway 7: (-12,-23,right,4) h=-12, τ=-23, s=4\n\nAt T: [-23 + 4(T-9), -12 + 4(T-9)]\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7: (-12,-23,right,4)\n\nNow, freeways 2,3,4 have identical cars, and 5 and 6 identical, 7 and 8 identical.\n\nWe start at y=6 at t=9.\n\nFirst, check if at t=9, on y=6, is there collision?\n\nFreeway 6: cars: one car with span at T=9: since T=9, T-9=0, so span [-23 +0, -12 +0] = [-23,-12]\n\n0 is not in [-23,-12] since -23 <= -12 < 0, so 0 not in, so no collision at t=9 for y=6.\n\nGood.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nBut we need to pass through y=7 and y=8 or other paths, but since we go up, likely y=7 and y=8.\n\ny=6 to y=7 to y=8 to y=9.\n\nEach move up takes one turn, but we might stay or move down to avoid.\n\nMin H, so we want to reach as soon as possible.\n\nThe earliest we can be at y=9 is if we move up at t=9, t=10, t=11, then at t=12, y=9? Let's see the turns.\n\nAt t=9, y=6\n\nAfter a_9, y_10 = y9 + Δy\n\nIf a9 = U, y10 =7\n\nThen at t=10, position y=7\n\nThen a10, y11 = y10 + Δy\n\nIf a10=U, y11=8\n\na11=U, y12=9\n\nThen at turn t=11, y11=8, and after a11, y12=9.\n\nBut we want to be at y=9 at turn T, so for T= t1 + H -1 =9 + H -1\n\nIf we are at y=9 at t=11, then T=11, so 9 + H -1 =11, so H-1=2, H=3.\n\nT= t1 + H -1 =11, t1=9, so 9 + H -1 =11, 8 + H =11, H=3.\n\nYes.\n\nWith actions at t=9,10,11: U,U,U, positions: t=9 y=6, t=10 y=7, t=11 y=8? After actions:\n\nAt t=9, y9=6, action a9=U, then y10=7\n\nAt t=10, position y10=7, action a10=U, y11=8\n\nAt t=11, position y11=8, action a11=U, y12=9\n\nBut at turn t=11, we are at y=8, not 9. We reach y=9 at turn t=12.\n\nI think I confused.\n\nPosition at turn t: y_t\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn T, means at that turn, position is 9.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=9, y=6\n\nt=10, y=7\n\nt=11, y=8\n\nt=12, y=9\n\nSo to be at y=9 at t=12, so T=12.\n\nThen T = t1 + H -1 =12, t1=9, so 9 + H -1 =12, H-1=3, H=4.\n\nActions from t=9 to t=12? t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nt1=9, H=4, actions at t=9,10,11.\n\nWith three actions: U at t=9 to go to y=7 at t=10, U at t=10 to go to y=8 at t=11, U at t=11 to go to y=9 at t=12.\n\nBut at turn t=12, we are at y=9, which is the goal.\n\nAnd the turn when we reach is t=12, which is t1 + H -1? t1=9, H=4, 9+4-1=12, yes.\n\nThe actions are for t=9,10,11, three actions, H=4? H is the number of turns? Let's see the definition.\n\n\"minimal number of turns H\" and \"sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so for t from 0 to H-1, that's H actions.\n\nThen reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nWith H actions, we have positions from t1 to t1+H, with y_{t1+H} after last action.\n\nBut we want y_{t1+H-1} =9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nIn the example, with actions at t=9,10,11 (H=3 actions), we have:\n\nAfter a9, y10=7 (turn t=10)\n\nAfter a10, y11=8 (turn t=11)\n\nAfter a11, y12=9 (turn t=12)\n\nBut the position at turn t=11 is y11=8, not 9. We reach y=9 at turn t=12.\n\nTo have y_T=9 at turn T, with T=t1+H-1.\n\nFor T=12, t1=9, 9+H-1=12, H-1=3, H=4.\n\nThen actions at t=9,10,11,12? But at t=12, if we are at y=9, and we take action, it might move away, but for reaching, we just need to be at 9 at turn t=12, so we can take any action, but to stay, we can choose S.\n\nBut in the sequence, with H=4 actions: a9, a10, a11, a12.\n\nBut with a9=U, a10=U, a11=U, then at t=12, y12=9, and we are at turn t=12, position y12=9.\n\nThen a12 can be S or whatever, but since we are already at 9, and we reach at t=12.\n\nThe actions include a12, but we don't need to move further, but it's part of the sequence to reach at that turn.\n\nWe can have a12=S to stay.\n\nBut for min H, we want the smallest H such that we reach at turn t1+H-1.\n\nThe earliest turn we can be at y=9 is t=12, with three up moves starting from t=9.\n\nAt t=9 y=6, after U, at t=10 y=7, after U, at t=11 y=8, after U, at t=12 y=9.\n\nSo at turn t=12, y=9.\n\nWith H=4, since actions at t=9,10,11,12, but we only need actions to move, but the sequence has H actions, including the last one.\n\nBut with a9=U, a10=U, a11=U, and a12, but at t=12 we are already at 9, so a12 can be S, but it's necessary to have the action at the reach turn? Let's see the reach turn.\n\nAt turn t=12, we are at y=9, and we take action a12, which might be S to stay, or U to go to 10 but y=10 not exist, y max 9, so U or D not possible, or S.\n\nBut the collision is only up to the turn we are at, I think.\n\nFor the sequence, we need to specify actions from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nWith H=4, actions at t=9,10,11,12.\n\nWith a9=U, a10=U, a11=U, a12=S, for example.\n\nThen positions: t=9 y=6, t=10 y=7, t=11 y=8, t=12 y=9.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut we need to check for collision at each turn when on freeway.\n\nAt t=9, y=6, freeway 6, car span at T=9: [-23,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAt t=10, y=7, freeway 7.\n\nFreeway 7: car at T=10.\n\nt=10, T=10, T-9=1\n\nCar: h=-12, τ=-23, s=4\n\nSpan at T=10: [-23 + 4*(10-9), -12 + 4*(1)] = [-23+4, -12+4] = [-19, -8]\n\n0 not in [-19,-8], safe.\n\nAt t=11, y=8, freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8: same as 7, car (-12,-23,right,4)\n\nAt T=11, T-9=2\n\nSpan: [-23 + 4*2, -12 + 4*2] = [-23+8, -12+8] = [-15, -4]\n\n0 not in [-15,-4], safe.\n\nAt t=12, y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nSo with this sequence, we can reach at t=12 with no collision.\n\nH=4, actions: a9=U, a10=U, a11=U, a12=S? But a12 is at turn t=12, when we are at y=9, and we take action, but since we reach at turn t=12, and action a12 is taken, but for collision, at t=12 we are safe.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to output actions from t9 to t12 for H=4.\n\nBut min H? Is there a way to reach earlier?\n\nThe earliest possible is at t=12, since from y=6, it takes at least 3 moves to y=9, so minimum 3 actions, reaching at t=12 with H=4.\n\nWith 3 actions: if we start at t=9 y=6, after first action U at t=9, to y=7 at t=10; after second U at t=10, to y=8 at t=11; after third U at t=11, to y=9 at t=12. So we are at y=9 at t=12, not earlier.\n\nAt t=9 we are at y=6, so we cannot be at y=9 before t=12.\n\nSo min H=4, reaching at turn 12.\n\nAnd with the actions above, it seems collision-free.\n\nBut let's confirm the car spans.\n\nAt t=10, y=7: freeway 7 car span at t=10: T=10, T-9=1, s=4, span [-23 +4*1, -12 +4*1] = [-19,-8], yes 0 not in.\n\nAt t=11, y=8: freeway 8 same car, span at t=11: T=11, T-9=2, [-23 +4*2, -12 +8] = [-15,-4], 0 not in.\n\nAnd at t=9 y=6 safe, t=12 y=9 safe.\n\nBut is there a problem with other freeways? No, because we are only on y=6,7,8 during the turns, and we checked those.\n\nBut when we are on y=7 at t=10, freeway 7 has only one car, we checked.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut freeway 7 has car at (-12,-23,right,4), but at different times.\n\nIn the sequence, we only care about when we are on that freeway.\n\nPerhaps for y=7 and y=8, at earlier or later times, but since we are only there at t=10 and t=11, and it's safe.\n\nBut is it possible to reach faster? No, as above.\n\nPerhaps by moving down or staying, but that would take more turns, so H larger, not min.\n\nSo min H=4.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut let's make sure about the car on freeway 6 at t=9.\n\nFreeway 6: car (-12,-23,right,6) at t=9, span [-23,-12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nBut at other times, for example, if we were to stay on y=6, we need to check if later it is unsafe.\n\nBut in this case, we move away immediately.\n\nSimilarly, for y=7, at t=10, span [-19,-8], safe.\n\nBut let's see when the car on y=7 covers x=0.\n\nFor freeway 7, car span [ -23 +4(T-9), -12 +4(T-9) ]\n\nSet -23 +4(T-9) <= 0 <= -12 +4(T-9)\n\nFirst inequality: -23 +4(T-9) <=0 => 4(T-9) <=23 => T-9 <= 23/4 = 5.75, so T <= 14.75, so T<=14 since integer.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -12 +4(T-9) => 12 <= 4(T-9) => 3 <= T-9 => T >=12\n\nSo for T from 12 to 14 inclusive, 0 in span.\n\nT=12: -23 +4(3) = -23+12= -11? T-9=3 for T=12? T=12, T-9=3\n\n-23 +4*3 = -23+12= -11\n\n-12 +12=0\n\nSpan [-11, 0] , so at T=12, span includes 0, since right-moving, tail at -11, head at 0, so x=0 is covered.\n\nSimilarly, T=13: -23+4*4= -23+16= -7, -12+16=4, span [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nT=14: -23+20= -3, -12+20=8, span [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nT=15: -23+24=1, -12+24=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, for T=11: T-9=2, -23+8= -15, -12+8= -4, span [-15,-4], 0 not in, as before.\n\nNow, in our plan, at t=10, we are on y=7, T=10, which is before 12, safe.\n\nAt t=11, we are on y=8, not y=7.\n\nNow for y=8, freeway 8, same as y=7 car, but separate freeway.\n\nFreeway 8: car (-12,-23,right,4), same as 7.\n\nAt T, span [ -23 +4(T-9), -12 +4(T-9) ]\n\nCollision when T from 12 to 14, as above.\n\nAt t=11, T=11, span [-15,-4], safe, as before.\n\nIn our sequence, at t=11 we are on y=8, safe.\n\nBut we need to go to y=9 at t=12.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nBut is there any issue?\n\nPerhaps at t=12, if we were on y=7 or y=8, it would be collision, but we are on y=9.\n\nIn the sequence with U,U,U and then S at t=12, but at t=12 we are on y=9, safe.\n\nBut the action at t=12 is S, but we don't need to move.\n\nBut in the sequence, it's fine.\n\nBut can we reach earlier? No.\n\nPerhaps we can move faster, but no.\n\nAnother thing: the player can move down or stay to avoid, but that would delay, so not better.\n\nBut let's check if at t=9, if we stay, then at t=10 y=6, but then we need to move later, so we reach later, worse.\n\nSimilarly, if we move down to y=5, but y=5 is freeway, might have cars, and it's away from 9, so takes more turns.\n\nSo not better.\n\nThus, min H=4 with actions U at t9, U at t10, U at t11, and S at t12? But at t12, we are at y=9, and we take action, but to stay, S.\n\nBut the reach turn is t=12, with y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions at t9, t10, t11, t12.\n\nWith a9=U, a10=U, a11=U, a12=S.\n\nThen positions: t9 y=6, t10 y=7, t11 y=8, t12 y=9.\n\nAll safe.\n\nBut do we need a12? Since we reach at t12, and we take action a12, but after that, y13 might be different, but we don't care, as long as at t12 we are at 9.\n\nAnd for collision, at t12 we are safe.\n\nPerhaps we can have only three actions: but with three actions, we can be at y=9 at t=12, but the position at t=12 is after the third action, but at turn t=12, we are at y=12? No.\n\nWith actions at t9, t10, t11: a9=U, a10=U, a11=U.\n\nThen after a9, y10=7 (at t=10)\n\nAfter a10, y11=8 (at t=11)\n\nAfter a11, y12=9 (at t=12)\n\nBut at turn t=11, we are at y=8, not 9. We reach y=9 at turn t=12.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn T, we need T such that y_T=9.\n\nIn this case, y12=9 at t=12.\n\nThe turn when we are at 9 is t=12.\n\nFor that, we need actions up to t=11 to set y12=9.\n\nThen at turn t=12, we are at 9, and we may take an action, but for the sequence to reach at t=12, we need to include the action at t=12 or not?\n\nAccording to the problem: \"sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nIn this case, t1=9, set T= t1 + H -1 =12, so H-1=3, H=4.\n\nThen actions at t1 to t1+H-1 = t9 to t12, four actions.\n\nWith a9=U, a10=U, a11=U, a12=S.\n\na12 can be S to stay, or since y=9, we can only S, as U or D would go out of bound, but the rule says y in [0,9], so if at y=9, U would try to go to 10, but not allowed, probably it stays or error, but to be safe, choose S.\n\nSimilarly for y=0.\n\nSo in this case, it should be fine.\n\nBut in the action sequence for t12, we put S.\n\nNow, but in the output, it should be for turns from t1 to the end.\n\nBut let's confirm if at t=10 on y=7, is it safe? We have span at t=10: [-19,-8], 0 not in, yes.\n\nBut freeway 7 has only one car? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 at t=11: span [-15,-4], 0 not in.\n\nBut freeway 2,3,4 have cars, but we are not on them.\n\nAnother thing: when we move from y=6 to y=7 at t=10, at turn t=9 we are on y=6, action U, so at turn t=10 we are on y=7.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nBut let's check if at some point, if we stay, it might be unsafe later, but in this case we move immediately.\n\nPerhaps for y=7, at t=10 it is safe, but if we were there later, unsafe, but we are not.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut is there a car on y=7 that we missed? Freeway 7 has only one car, as per table.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut freeway 2,3,4 have multiple cars, but we are not on them.\n\nFor example, on freeway 2, at time t, when does collision happen.\n\nBut we don't care since we won't be there.\n\nTo be thorough, let's see if we can go directly without issue.\n\nPerhaps we can reach in fewer turns by being at y=9 earlier, but impossible.\n\nAnother idea: start at t=9 y=6, if we move up to y=7 at t=10, then at t=10 on y=7, if we move up to y=8 at t=11, then to y=9 at t=12.\n\nBut at t=11, if we are on y=8, it is safe, as above.\n\nBut suppose at t=11, y=8 is unsafe, but in this case it is safe.\n\nIn our calculation, at t=11, y=8 span [-15,-4], safe.\n\nBut let's check for y=8 car: same as y=7, collision at T=12,13,14.\n\nAt t=11, T=11, safe.\n\nAt t=12, if we were on y=8, it would be collision, but we are on y=9.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut in the sequence, with a12=S, but since we reach at t=12, and we take action, but it's fine.\n\nPerhaps for min H, we don't need to take action after reaching, but according to the definition, we need to specify actions until the reach turn.\n\nThe sequence includes actions from t1 to t1+H-1, and at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9.\n\nSo we must include the action at that turn.\n\nIn this case, a12 can be S.\n\nBut in the output, we need to write the actions.\n\nBut let's see the answer format.\n\n\"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\"\n\netc.\n\nFor t1=9.\n\nSo actions: Turn 9: U, Turn 10: U, Turn 11: U, Turn 12: S\n\nH=4.\n\nBut is H=4 the minimal? Yes.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach at an earlier turn with different moves.\n\nFor example, at t=9, if we do nothing, stay, then at t=10 y=6, then we need to move up three times, reaching at t=13, worse.\n\nOr move down to y=5, but y=5 has cars? Freeway 5: at t=9, car (-12,-23,right,6), span [-23,-12], 0 not in, but if we go to y=5, at some turn, it might be unsafe.\n\nFor example, at t=9, if we move down, a9=D, then y10=5, at turn t=10, on y=5.\n\nFreeway 5: car at T=10, T-9=1, s=6, span [-23+6(1), -12+6(1)] = [-17,-6], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen we can move up later, but it takes more turns to reach y=9.\n\nFor example, from y=5 to y=9, need +4, min 4 moves, reaching at t=14 or later, worse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nThus, the direct path seems best.\n\nBut let's check for freeway 7 and 8 at other times to be sure.\n\nPerhaps there is a constraint I missed.\n\nAnother thing: the cars on freeway 2,3,4, for example, if we were on them, but we are not.\n\nBut let's see if on y=7 at t=10, is there any car? Only one, safe.\n\nBut freeway 7 has only one car, as per table.\n\nSimilarly for 8.\n\nIn the table, freeway 7: (-12,-23,right,4), one car.\n\nSimilarly for all.\n\nFreeway 1: at t=9, span [-47,-36]? h=-36, τ=-47, so span [-47,-36], 0 not in.\n\nCollision when? -47 +3(T-9) <=0 <= -36 +3(T-9)\n\nFirst: -47+3(T-9) <=0 => 3(T-9) <=47 => T-9 <=47/3≈15.666, T<=24\n\nSecond: 0 <= -36 +3(T-9) => 36 <=3(T-9) => 12 <= T-9 => T>=21\n\nSo collision T=21 to 24.\n\nNot relevant for us.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 cars: for example, first car (60,49,right,12) at T=9 span [49,60], 0 not in.\n\nCollision: 49+12(T-9) <=0? 49+12(T-9) <=0 => 12(T-9) <= -49, impossible since left side non-neg for T>=9? T-9>=0, so 49+12(T-9) >=49>0, so 0 never <= left, so no collision for this car.\n\nSimilarly, second car (-24,-35,right,12), at T=9 span [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nCollision: -35+12(T-9) <=0 <= -24+12(T-9)\n\nFirst: -35+12(T-9) <=0 => 12(T-9) <=35 => T-9 <= 35/12≈2.916, so T<=11.916, T<=11\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24+12(T-9) => 24 <=12(T-9) => 2 <= T-9 => T>=11\n\nSo for T=11, collision.\n\nAt T=11, span: -35+12(2)= -35+24= -11, -24+24=0, span [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nSimilarly, T=10: -35+12(1)= -23, -24+12= -12, span [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nT=12: -35+36=1, -24+36=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nThird car (12,1,right,12), at T=9 span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nCollision: 1+12(T-9) <=0? impossible, or 0 <=12+12(T-9) always, but 1+12(T-9) <=0 <=12+12(T-9) only if 1+12(T-9) <=0, impossible, so no collision ever.\n\nSo for freeway 2, collision only at T=11 from the second car.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 3 and 4, same.\n\nBut we are not on freeway 2,3,4 in our path.\n\nIn our path, at t=10 we are on y=7, not 2.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow for freeway 5 and 6: freeway 5 car (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nCollision: -23+6(T-9) <=0 <= -12+6(T-9)\n\nFirst: -23+6(T-9) <=0 => 6(T-9) <=23 => T-9 <= 23/6≈3.833, T<=12.833, T<=12\n\nSecond: 0 <= -12+6(T-9) => 12 <=6(T-9) => 2 <= T-9 => T>=11\n\nSo collision T=11,12.\n\nAt T=11: -23+6(2)= -23+12= -11, -12+12=0, span [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nT=12: -23+18= -5, -12+18=6, span [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nT=10: -23+6= -17, -12+6= -6, span [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 6, same car.\n\nIn our path, at t=9, we are on y=6, freeway 6, at T=9, span [-23,-12], safe.\n\nAt t=11, we are on y=8, not y=6.\n\nIf we stayed on y=6 at t=11, it would be collision, but we move away.\n\nSimilarly, for y=5, if we were there at t=11, unsafe, but we are not.\n\nSo in the direct path, no issue.\n\nTherefore, we can go with U,U,U,S for t=9,10,11,12.\n\nBut in the sequence, for H=4, actions at t=9,10,11,12.\n\na12=S.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n\nBut the current turn is t1=9, but in the problem it says \"current turn is \\{t_1\\}\" and \"t_0 = 9\", I think t1=9.\n\nIn the output, it should be:\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: S\n\nBut for turn 12, since we reach at turn 12, and we put S, but actually, we don't need to move, but it's fine.\n\nPerhaps we can have only three actions, but then we reach at turn 12, but the position at turn 12 is after the third action, but for turn t=12, we need to be at y=9, which requires the action at t=11 to be U when at y=8.\n\nAnd at turn t=11, we are at y=8, which must be safe, and it is.\n\nBut the sequence must include the actions up to the reach turn? I think with H=4, it includes the action at the reach turn.\n\nAnother way: suppose we want to reach at turn T=12 with y=9.\n\nThen the actions before that determine how we get there.\n\nActions at t=9,10,11 determine y10,y11,y12.\n\ny12=9 requires that at t=11, y11=8 and a11=U.\n\nSimilarly, y11=8 requires at t=10, y10=7 and a10=U, etc.\n\nAnd for collision, we need safety at t=9,10,11,12.\n\nAt t=12, y=9, safe.\n\nAt t=11, y=8, need safe, which it is.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the sequence with three actions: a9=U, a10=U, a11=U, then at t=12, y=9.\n\nBut the turn when we are at y=9 is t=12.\n\nFor that, the actions are from t=9 to t=11, three actions.\n\nThen H=3? Let's see.\n\nt1=9, H=3, then t1 + H -1 =9+3-1=11, but we want y_{11}=9? But at t=11, y=8, not 9.\n\ny_{t1+H-1} = y_{11}, which is 8, not 9.\n\nWe need y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nWith H=3, t1+H-1=11, y11=8 ≠9.\n\nTo have y11=9, we need to be at y=9 at turn 11.\n\nBut from y=6 at t=9, to y=9 at t=11, that means in two turns: from t=9 to t=10, and t=10 to t=11.\n\nAt t=9 y=6, after a9, y10=?\n\nIf a9=U, y10=7\n\nThen at t=10, y10=7, after a10, y11=?\n\nTo be at y=9 at t=11, y11=9, so a10 must be U, but from y=7, U to y=8, not 9.\n\nCannot reach y=9 in one move from y=7.\n\nMax y increase per move is +1, so from y=6, min turns to reach y=9 is 3 moves, reaching at t=12.\n\nThus, cannot reach before t=12.\n\nTherefore, min H=4, with actions at t=9,10,11,12: U,U,U,S.\n\na12=S to stay at 9.\n\nIn the sequence, we can put a12=S.\n\nPerhaps a12 can be anything, but S is fine.\n\nNow, but in the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, at t=10 and t=11, safe, but let's confirm the values.\n\nt=10, y=7: T=10, freeway 7 car: span [-23 +4*(10-9), -12 +4*1] = [-23+4, -12+4] = [-19,-8], 0 not in.\n\nt=11, y=8: T=11, freeway 8 car: span [-23 +4*(11-9), -12 +4*2] = [-23+8, -12+8] = [-15,-4], 0 not in.\n\nt=9, y=6: freeway 6 car: at T=9, [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nt=12, y=9: safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 2,3,4, there are multiple cars, but we are not on them.\n\nFor example, freeway 2 has a car that causes collision at t=11, but we are not on freeway 2 at t=11.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=4.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: S\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nIt should be in a box.\n\nBut let's write it.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 6)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 9\\) is 4. The sequence of actions is designed to move the player directly upward while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n- At turn 9, the player is at \\(y = 6\\). Freeway 6 has a car with span \\([-23, -12]\\) at turn 9, and 0 is not in this span, so no collision occurs. The action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 7\\) for turn 10.\n- At turn 10, the player is at \\(y = 7\\). Freeway 7 has a car with span \\([-19, -8]\\) at turn 10 (calculated as \\([-23 + 4 \\times (10-9), -12 + 4 \\times (10-9)] = [-19, -8]\\)), and 0 is not in this span, so no collision occurs. The action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 8\\) for turn 11.\n- At turn 11, the player is at \\(y = 8\\). Freeway 8 has a car with span \\([-15, -4]\\) at turn 11 (calculated as \\([-23 + 4 \\times (11-9), -12 + 4 \\times (11-9)] = [-15, -4]\\)), and 0 is not in this span, so no collision occurs. The action \\(U\\) moves the player to \\(y = 9\\) for turn 12.\n- At turn 12, the player is at \\(y = 9\\), which has no cars and is safe. The action \\(S\\) keeps the player at \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThis sequence reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 12 (\\(t_1 + H - 1 = 9 + 4 - 1 = 12\\)) with no collisions. Any fewer than 4 turns is impossible, as moving from \\(y = 6\\) to \\(y = 9\\) requires at least three upward moves, and the earliest arrival turn is 12.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 9: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: \\, S \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,8) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars. The player starts at y=8 at turn t=11. I need to reach y=9. Since y=9 is the goal, and I'm already at y=8, I might be able to just move up once, but I have to make sure I don't collide with any cars on the way.\n\nThe collision rule says that at turn T, if I'm on freeway y_T, and for any car on that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at that turn, then I collide. Also, when I move, I'm only on the new row at the next turn. Let me read that carefully.\n\nIt says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, when I take an action at turn T, I move to the new position at turn T+1. At turn T, I'm still on the previous row.\n\nLet me denote the turn when I take action.\n\nAt the start of turn t_1 = 11, I'm at (0,8).\n\nI take action a_{11}, which determines y_{12}.\n\nThen at turn 12, I'm at y_{12}, and I might collide if on that row, 0 is in some car's span at turn 12.\n\nSimilarly for subsequent turns.\n\nI need to reach y_{t} = 9 for some t, and at that turn, when I arrive, I should not collide, meaning that at that turn, on y_t=9, there should be no car where 0 is in span at that turn.\n\nThe goal is to be at (0,9), so at some turn T, I am at position (0,9), and at that turn, for freeway y_T=9, no car should have 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nAlso, during the moves, when I'm on intermediate rows, I shouldn't collide.\n\nBut y=9 is the top row, and there are no cars on y=9 because cars are only on freeways y=1 to 8. The vertical axis is y=0 to 9, with freeways y=1 to 8 having cars. y=0 and y=9 are the edges, I think, with no cars.\n\nLet me check.\n\n\"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,…,8.\"\n\nAnd the grid is y=0,1,…,9.\n\nSo y=0 and y=9 should be safe, with no cars, I assume.\n\nSimilarly, the player starts at (0,8), which is on row y=8, and there are cars on y=8.\n\nThe goal is (0,9), which is row y=9, no cars, so once I reach y=9, I should be safe.\n\nBut I need to get there without colliding on the way.\n\nSince I'm at y=8, and I want to go to y=9, I need to move up, but I have to do it at a time when moving to y=9 is safe, meaning that at the turn when I arrive at y=9, there should be no car on y=8 or something? No.\n\nWhen I move from y=8 to y=9, at the turn when I take the action, say turn T, I am at y=8. I take action U, so at turn T+1, I am at y=9.\n\nAt turn T, I am on y=8, so I need that at turn T, on y=8, 0 is not in any car's span for that row.\n\nThen at turn T+1, I am on y=9, and since y=9 has no cars, I should be safe.\n\nBut the collision is checked at the turn when I am on the row.\n\nSo for turn T, when I am on row y_T, I need that for that row, at that turn, no car has 0 in span.\n\nNow, when I arrive at y=9 at turn T+1, at that turn, I am on y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nBut during the move, I might be on other rows.\n\nIn this case, since I start at y=8 and want to go directly to y=9, I only need to be on y=8 at some turn when it's safe, then move up.\n\nBut I might need to wait or something if it's not safe.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the state of the cars at turn t_1=11 and future turns.\n\nThe car positions are given at turn t_1=11.\n\nFor each car, we have (head, tail, direction, speed) at turn 11.\n\nThen for future turns, we can compute the span.\n\nSince all cars are moving right, based on the table.\n\nLet me list all cars per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-30, -41, right, 3)\n\nSince direction is right, head is at -30, tail at -41? That doesn't make sense because tail should be left of head if moving right.\n\nLet's see the update rule.\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIt says: for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] meaning tail τ, head h, so if moving right, head is greater than tail.\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor freeway 1: (-30, -41, right, 3)\n\n-30 and -41, but -30 > -41? -30 is greater than -41, since -30 is to the right if x increases to the right.\n\nAssuming x-axis, with 0 being the player's x-position.\n\nSo, for a right-moving car, head should be at higher x than tail.\n\nHere, head = -30, tail = -41, since -30 > -41, so head is at -30, tail at -41, so the car spans from -41 to -30 at t_1=11.\n\nDirection right, speed 3.\n\nSimilarly, for other cars.\n\nIn the update, for right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSince τ and h are positions at t_1.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, but all here are right-moving, I think.\n\nFreeway 1 has one car.\n\nFreeway 2: three cars: (-36, -47, right, 12), (0, -11, right, 12), (36, 25, right, 12)\n\n36, 25? 36 and 25, but if moving right, head should be greater, 36 > 25, so head=36, tail=25? But in the tuple it's (head, tail), so (36,25) means head=36, tail=25? But tail=25, head=36, that would be from 25 to 36, which is right-moving, yes.\n\nSimilarly, (0, -11) head=0, tail=-11, so from -11 to 0.\n\n(-36, -47) head=-36, tail=-47, from -47 to -36.\n\nAll with speed 12.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 3 and 4, same as freeway 2? No.\n\nFreeway 3: (-36, -47, right, 12), (0, -11, right, 12), (36, 25, right, 12) — same as freeway 2?\n\nLet me copy:\n\nFreeway 2: (-36, -47, right, 12), (0, -11, right, 12), (36, 25, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 3: (-36, -47, right, 12), (0, -11, right, 12), (36, 25, right, 12) — identical to freeway 2?\n\nThat can't be right, or maybe it is, but let's see.\n\nFreeway 4: same: (-36, -47, right, 12), (0, -11, right, 12), (36, 25, right, 12)\n\nAll freeways 2,3,4 have identical cars? But they are on different rows, so it's possible.\n\nFreeway 5: (0, -11, right, 6) — one car, head=0, tail=-11, speed 6\n\nFreeway 6: (0, -11, right, 6) — same as freeway 5\n\nFreeway 7: (-4, -15, right, 4) — head=-4, tail=-15, speed 4\n\nFreeway 8: (-4, -15, right, 4) — same as freeway 7\n\nAnd freeway 1: (-30, -41, right, 3)\n\nNow, I am at y=8 at turn 11.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nTo move up, I need to be at y=8 at some turn T, take action U, so at T+1 I am at y=9.\n\nAt turn T, when I am at y=8, I need that on row y=8, at turn T, no car has 0 in its span.\n\nThen at T+1, I am at y=9, safe.\n\nI could also move down or stay, but since I want minimal turns, and y=9 is above, moving down would take more time, so probably not useful. Similarly, staying might be needed if not safe to move.\n\nBut I start at turn 11, position y=8.\n\nAt turn 11, I am on y=8, so I need to check if at turn 11, on y=8, is 0 in any car's span.\n\nFreeway 8 has cars: (-4, -15, right, 4)\n\nAt turn 11, span is from tail to head: [-15, -4]? Tail is -15, head is -4, so the car occupies x from -15 to -4.\n\n0 is not in this span, since -15 to -4, all negative, 0 is not included.\n\n0 is greater than -4? -4 is less than 0, so the car is from x=-15 to x=-4, so x=0 is not covered, so 0 not in span.\n\nSo at turn 11, on y=8, no car has 0 in span, so I am safe at turn 11.\n\nI can take action U at turn 11, so at turn 12, I move to y=9.\n\nAt turn 12, I am at y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nAnd I reached y=9 at turn 12, which is turn t_1 +1, since t_1=11, t_1 +1=12.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t=0 to H-1, so actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nI need the sequence of actions.\n\nStart at turn 11, position y=8.\n\nAt turn 11, I take action a_{11}.\n\nAfter action, at turn 12, new position.\n\nThe sequence should be for t from 0 to H-1, but relative to t_1.\n\nThe answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, Turn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}, etc.\n\nAnd H is the number of actions.\n\nIn this case, if I take one action: at turn 11, action U, then at turn 12, I am at y=9.\n\nSo H=1, since only one action.\n\nt from t=0 to H-1, so for H=1, t=0 only, action at t_1 +0 = t_1.\n\nThen position at t_1 + H = t_1 +1.\n\nIn general, after H actions, I am at turn t_1 + H.\n\nAnd I need to be at (0,9) at that turn.\n\nHere, at turn t_1 + H = 11 + H, y=9.\n\nWith H=1, at turn 12, y=9.\n\nBut I need to confirm that at turn 11, when I am at y=8, it is safe, which it is, as above.\n\nThen at turn 12, y=9, safe.\n\nBut is there any issue?\n\nThe car on y=8 at turn 11: span [-15,-4], 0 not in.\n\nBut when I move, at turn 11, I take action U, so at turn 12, I arrive at y=9.\n\nDuring turn 11, I am on y=8, and I take action, but the position change happens at the next turn.\n\nIn terms of collision, only at the turn when I am on the row.\n\nAt turn 11, I am on y=8, no collision.\n\nAt turn 12, I am on y=9, no cars.\n\nSo it should be fine.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on y=8.\n\nFreeway 8: car (-4, -15, right, 4)\n\nAt turn 11: head = -4, tail = -15, so the car is from x=-15 to x=-4.\n\n0 is at x=0, which is greater than -4, so not covered.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways don't matter for now.\n\nBut at turn 11, I am on y=8, so only y=8 cars matter.\n\nFreeway 8 has one car, as above.\n\nSo safe.\n\nTherefore, I can just move up immediately at turn 11.\n\nSo action: Turn 11: U\n\nThen at turn 12, y=9.\n\nH=1.\n\nBut the sequence should be from t=0 to H-1, so only one action: at t_1.\n\nAnswer: Turn 11: U\n\nBut let me confirm the turn numbering.\n\nt_1 = 11, current turn.\n\nI need to output the actions starting from turn t_1.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nHere a_{11} = U\n\nAnd that's it, since H=1.\n\nBut is y=9 really safe? The grid has y=0 to 9, and cars only on 1-8, so y=9 has no cars, so yes.\n\nBut let me make sure about the collision condition.\n\n\"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAt turn T, for the row y_T I am on.\n\nWhen I am at y=9, no cars, so no collision possible.\n\nSimilarly, at y=0, no cars.\n\nIn this case, it seems straightforward.\n\nBut why are there other freeways? Maybe for if I need to go through them, but I don't, since I start at y=8 and go directly to y=9.\n\nPerhaps at turn 11, it is safe, but let me see if for other turns, but I only need one move.\n\nBut the player is at (0,8), and I need to reach (0,9), so moving up once should do it.\n\nBut let me check if at turn 11, on y=8, it is indeed safe.\n\nFreeway 8: car at [-15,-4], 0 not in.\n\nBut is there only one car? Freeway 8 has only one car: (-4, -15, right, 4)\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I should compute the position for other turns to be thorough.\n\nMaybe for moving up, I need to be on y=8 at a safe turn.\n\nAt turn 11, it is safe.\n\nBut let me see the future positions of the car on y=8.\n\nThe car moves right at speed 4.\n\nAt turn T, span is [τ + s(T-11), h + s(T-11)] for right-moving.\n\nHere τ = -15, h = -4, s=4.\n\nSo at turn T, span: [ -15 + 4(T-11), -4 + 4(T-11) ]\n\n0 in span when min <= 0 <= max.\n\nSince head is at higher x, so when -15 + 4(T-11) <= 0 <= -4 + 4(T-11)\n\nOr since it's a closed interval, I assume.\n\n0 ∈ [L, U] where L = τ + s(T-11), U = h + s(T-11)\n\nSo L <= 0 <= U.\n\nFor freeway 8, L = -15 + 4(T-11), U = -4 + 4(T-11)\n\nSet L <= 0 <= U\n\n-15 + 4(T-11) <= 0 and 0 <= -4 + 4(T-11)\n\nFirst inequality: -15 + 4(T-11) <= 0 => 4(T-11) <= 15 => T-11 <= 15/4 = 3.75, so T-11 <= 3 since T integer? T-11 <= floor(3.75) but inequality.\n\n4(T-11) <= 15, T-11 <= 3.75, so for integer T, T-11 <= 3, so T <= 14\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -4 + 4(T-11) => 4 <= 4(T-11) => 1 <= T-11 => T-11 >=1, so T >=12\n\nSo 0 in span when T >=12 and T <=14.\n\nFor T=12,13,14.\n\nAt turn 12: L = -15 +4(1) = -11, U= -4 +4(1) =0? T-11=1 for T=12\n\nL = -15 +4(1) = -15+4= -11\n\nU = -4 +4(1) =0\n\nSo span [-11, 0], so 0 is included, since U=0.\n\nSimilarly, T=13: L=-15+4(2)= -15+8=-7, U=-4+8=4, span [-7,4], 0 in.\n\nT=14: L=-15+12=-3, U=-4+12=8, span [-3,8], 0 in.\n\nT=15: L=-15+16=1, U=-4+16=12, span [1,12], 0 not in since 0<1.\n\nSimilarly, T=11: L=-15+0=-15, U=-4, span [-15,-4], 0 not in.\n\nSo at turn 11, safe; turns 12,13,14 not safe on y=8.\n\nBut for me, at turn 11, I am on y=8, safe, and I move up to y=9 at turn 12.\n\nAt turn 12, I am on y=9, not on y=8, so I don't care about y=8 cars at turn 12.\n\nOnly at turn 12, I am on y=9, which is safe.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nIf I stayed on y=8 at turn 11, I would be safe, but if I stay, at turn 12, I am still on y=8, and at turn 12, it is not safe, so I would collide if I stay.\n\nBut I don't stay; I move up.\n\nSo with one action U at turn 11, I reach y=9 at turn 12.\n\nMinimal H=1.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and I do at turn 12.\n\nBut let me check if there are any constraints I missed.\n\nThe player position is (0,y), and cars are on the freeways, but when moving, I only care about the row I am on at each turn.\n\nAlso, for other rows, but since I am only on y=8 and then y=9, no issue.\n\nBut y=9 is not a freeway with cars, so fine.\n\nPerhaps I should look at the other cars to see if there is any reason I need to wait.\n\nFor example, if I were on a lower row, but here I am already at y=8.\n\nAnother thing: when I move to y=9, is there any car on y=9? No, as per the problem.\n\nSo I think H=1 is possible.\n\nBut let me see the car states again.\n\nFreeway 8 has car at turn 11: [-15,-4], 0 not in.\n\nFreeway 7 also has car, but I am not on y=7.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nBut in the list, freeway 8 has only one car, and at turn 11, it is safe.\n\nPerhaps I misread the freeway.\n\nFreeway 8: (-4, -15, right, 4) so head=-4, tail=-15, so at turn 11, from x=-15 to x=-4.\n\n0 is at x=0, which is to the right, not covered.\n\nYes.\n\nTo be thorough, let's list all cars that might affect, but only when I am on their row.\n\nSince I am only on y=8 at turn 11, and then y=9 at turn 12, no other rows involved.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 1, with action U at turn 11.\n\nSo the sequence is just one action.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U\n}\n\nBut let me confirm the turn.\n\nCurrent turn is t_1=11.\n\nSo Turn 11: U\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nBut the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", for H=1, t=0 only, a_{t_1 +0} = a_{11}\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I need to output multiple lines, but only one.\n\nMaybe I should check if at turn 12, when I arrive at y=9, but y=9 has no cars, so fine.\n\nAnother thing: the vertical axis, y=0 to 9, and freeways y=1 to 8 have cars, y=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\nAlso, the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with actions at t.\n\nAt t, action affects y_{t+1}.\n\nIn this case, at t=11, action U, y_{12} = 8 +1 =9.\n\nPosition at turn 12 is (0,9).\n\nAnd at turn 12, on y=9, no collision.\n\nAt turn 11, on y=8, no collision.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut why are there multiple cars on other rows? For example, on y=2,3,4, there are cars at (0,-11,right,12), so at turn 11, on y=2, for example, the car (0,-11,right,12) has head=0, tail=-11, so span [-11,0] at turn 11, so 0 is included, so if I were on y=2 at turn 11, I would collide, but I am not.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows.\n\nBut for me, not relevant.\n\nSo I think for this specific case, since I start at y=8 and it's safe to move up immediately, H=1.\n\nBut let me see the initial position: (0,8), and turn 11.\n\nCar on y=8: (-4,-15,right,4), at turn 11, -15 to -4, 0 not in.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps the head and tail are defined differently.\n\nIn the car state, it says (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor right-moving, head should be the front, so higher x.\n\nIn freeway 8, (-4,-15), -4 > -15, so head at -4, tail at -15, so from -15 to -4.\n\nYes.\n\nIf it were left-moving, but all are right.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of turns is H=1, with action U at turn 11.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U\n}\n\nBut the format says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and for multiple, but here only one.\n\nPerhaps I need to write it as such.\n\nBut let me make sure that at turn 11, I can take action.\n\nThe player is at (0,8) at turn 11, which is the start of turn.\n\nI take action, then move.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps for y=9, since it's the top, moving up might not be possible, but the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, and y must be in [0,9], so from y=8, U to 9 is allowed, and at 9, I can stay or move down, but I don't need to, since I reached.\n\nIn this case, I reach at turn 12.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps the problem is that at turn 11, if I move up, I need to be sure that at turn 12, y=9 is safe, which it is.\n\nNo issue.\n\nSo I believe this is correct.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) at turn \\(t_1 = 11\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) without colliding with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\).\n\nAt turn 11, the player is on freeway \\(y = 8\\). The car on freeway 8 at turn 11 has a span of \\([-15, -4]\\) (from tail to head, since it is right-moving). Since \\(0\\) is not in the interval \\([-15, -4]\\), no collision occurs at turn 11. Therefore, the player can safely take action \\(U\\) (up) at turn 11, moving to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 12.\n\nAt turn 12, the player is on \\(y = 9\\). Since there are no cars on \\(y = 9\\) (as cars only exist on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\)), the position (0, 9) is reached without collision.\n\nThus, only one action is needed, and \\(H = 1\\). The sequence of actions consists of a single action at turn 11.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: U\n}",
