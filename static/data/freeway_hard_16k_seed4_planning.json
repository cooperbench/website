        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The cars are moving, and I have to make sure that when I'm on a particular row at a particular turn, I'm not where a car is at that exact turn.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. For left-moving cars, the span decreases over time because they're moving left, so the head and tail both decrease by s*(T-t1) for time T after t1. Similarly, for right-moving cars, both head and tail increase by s*(T-t1).\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1 and 2, it's (48, 83, left, 36). Since it's left-moving, and head is 48, tail is 83? That seems odd because if it's moving left, the head should be smaller than the tail, I think. Let me read the span definition.\n\nFor left-moving, span is [h, τ], and it becomes [h - s dt, τ - s dt]. But if h and τ are positions, for left-moving, if head is at smaller x, tail at larger x, then as it moves left, both decrease. But here for freeway 1, head=48, tail=83, which would mean head is at 48, tail at 83, so it's from 48 to 83, and moving left, so positions decrease.\n\nBut typically, we think of head as the front, so for left-moving, front should be left, so smaller x. Here head=48, tail=83, so if x increases to the right, head at 48, tail at 83, so it's facing left, moving left, so head is left, tail is right. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, head should be larger. For example, freeway 3: (48,37,right,6) — head=48, tail=37, so head is at 48, tail at 37, so since it's right-moving, head is right, tail is left, so positions increase over time.\n\nNow, collision occurs only if at turn T, when I'm on freeway y_T, and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at time T. Meaning, if the car covers x=0 at that time.\n\nAlso, note that when I move, I'm not on the new row until the next turn. So if at turn T I move from y to y+1, at turn T I'm still on y, and at T+1 I'm on y+1. So for collision check at turn T, I'm on y_T, and I check cars on that row at time T.\n\nThe player position at turn T is (0, y_T), and for that turn, we check if there's a car on freeway y_T that has 0 in its span at time T.\n\nIf I'm moving, at the turn when I decide to move, I'm still on the current row, and only next turn I'm on the new row.\n\nNow, the goal is to reach y=9 from y=0 with min turns.\n\ny=0 to y=9, so I need to go up 9 units. Each U action moves me up by 1, D down by 1, S stays. But since I start at 0 and need to go to 9, I probably need at least 9 U actions, and possibly some S or D if I have to wait, but D might not be useful since I need to go up.\n\nD could be used to avoid something, but since cars are only on y=1 to 8, and y=0 and y=9 have no cars, I think, so I can stay on 0 or 9 safely.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I assume, since freeways are y=1 to 8. The vertical axis is y=0 to 9, but cars are on freeways y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars.\n\nSo I can stay on y=0 or y=9 without problem.\n\nNow, to go from 0 to 9, min actions: if no cars, I could just do U 9 times, but with cars, I might need to wait or go around, but since it's a straight path up, I can only go up, down, or stay, so I have to go through each row.\n\nEach move changes y by +1, -1, or 0, so to go from 0 to 9, net +9, so number of U minus number of D must be 9, and H turns, let U be number of U, D number of D, S number of S, then U + D + S = H, and U - D = 9.\n\nSo H = U + D + S = (U - D) + 2D + S = 9 + 2D + S.\n\nSince D and S are non-negative, min H is 9 when D=0 and S=0, meaning all U, no down or stay.\n\nBut with cars, I might have to wait or go down to avoid collisions, which would increase H.\n\nSo I need to check if it's possible to go straight up without colliding, and if not, find a way with minimal extra steps.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their positions over time.\n\nCurrent turn is t1=0, I think. \"current turn is {t_1}\", but in the task it says \"Turn t_0 = 0\", and \"Current Turn: t_0 = 0\", so t1=0.\n\nPlayer position (0,0) at turn 0.\n\nNow, I need to reach (0,9) at some turn H, so y_{t1 + H} or? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, and after H actions, at turn t1 + H, position should be (0,9).\n\nActions from t=0 to H-1, so after t=0 to H-1, we have turns from t1 to t1 + H -1? Let's clarify.\n\nThe sequence is actions at times t1, t1+1, ..., t1 + H -1.\n\nAfter applying a_{t1}, position at t1+1, and so on, up to after a_{t1 + H -1}, position at t1 + H.\n\nAnd we want y_{t1 + H} = 9.\n\nAnd collision at turn T if at that turn, y_T is between 1 and 8, and 0 is in the span of some car on freeway y_T at time T.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to know when a car covers x=0.\n\nSince the cars are moving, I can compute for each freeway, at what times the car spans include 0.\n\nThen for each row, I can find times when it's unsafe to be there.\n\nBut since I move step by step, I need to simulate the path.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, (48,83,left,36)\n\nSince left-moving, span at time T: [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] = [48 - 36(T-0), 83 - 36(T-0)] for T >=0.\n\nt1=0, so at time T, span [48 - 36T, 83 - 36T]\n\nCollision if 0 in [48-36T, 83-36T], so 48-36T <= 0 <= 83-36T\n\nSo 48-36T <= 0 => 36T >= 48 => T >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333\n\nAnd 0 <= 83-36T => 36T <= 83 => T <= 83/36 ≈2.305\n\nSo for T from ceil(4/3) to floor(83/36)? Since T integer, T=2 only? Let's see:\n\nT min: 48-36T <=0 => T >= 48/36 = 4/3 = 1.333, so T>=2 since T integer.\n\nT max: 0 <= 83-36T => 36T <=83 => T <= 83/36 ≈2.305, so T<=2.\n\nThus T=2, 48-72 = -24? At T=2: [48-72, 83-72] = [-24, 11], and 0 is between -24 and 11, yes.\n\nAt T=1: [48-36, 83-36] = [12,47], 0 not in.\n\nT=3: [48-108, 83-108] = [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=2, on freeway 1, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, (48,83,left,36), so also only unsafe at T=2.\n\nNow freeway 3: multiple cars? Cars listed: (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nAll right-moving, so for each, span at time T: [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] since right-moving, span [τ, h] to [τ + sT, h + sT]\n\nFor first car: (48,37,right,6), head=48, tail=37? But for right-moving, head should be larger, tail smaller, so span [τ, h] = [37,48] at T=0.\n\nThen at T, [37 + 6T, 48 + 6T]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12,1,right,6), so [1,12] at T=0, at T [1+6T, 12+6T]\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,6), [-35,-24] at T=0, at T [-35+6T, -24+6T]\n\nNow, collision if 0 in any span.\n\nFirst car: 0 in [37+6T, 48+6T]? 37+6T <=0 <=48+6T\n\n37+6T <=0 => 6T <= -37, impossible since T>=0, so never for first car.\n\nSecond car: 0 in [1+6T, 12+6T]\n\n1+6T <=0 <=12+6T\n\n1+6T <=0 => 6T <= -1, impossible.\n\n12+6T >=0 always for T>=0.\n\nBut 1+6T <=0 never, so 0 not in [1+6T,12+6T] for any T.\n\nThird car: 0 in [-35+6T, -24+6T]\n\n-35+6T <=0 <= -24+6T\n\nFirst inequality: -35+6T <=0 => 6T <=35 => T <= 35/6 ≈5.833\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24+6T => 6T >=24 => T>=4\n\nSo T from 4 to 5, since T integer.\n\nT=4: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], 0 is in, yes.\n\nT=5: [-35+30, -24+30] = [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nT=3: [-35+18, -24+18] = [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nT=6: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe for third car at T=4 and T=5.\n\nNow, are there other cars? Freeway 3 has three cars, but we have spans, and 0 covered only by third car at T=4,5.\n\nFirst and second cars never cover 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same as freeway 3? \" (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6) \" same as freeway 3, so unsafe at T=4 and T=5.\n\nFreeway 5: only (48,37,right,6), which we saw for freeway 3, first car, never covers 0, so always safe? At T=0, [37,48], not 0; as T increases, [37+6T,48+6T] all positive, so never covers 0. Similarly, freeway 6,7,8 all have only (48,37,right,6), same thing, always safe.\n\nFreeway 5: (48,37,right,6), which is head=48, tail=37, right-moving, so span [37,48] at T=0, [37+6T,48+6T], min is 37>0, so never <=0, so 0 never in span, safe always.\n\nSimilarly freeway 6,7,8 same, only that car, so always safe.\n\nNow freeway 1 and 2 unsafe only at T=2.\n\nFreeway 3 and 4 unsafe at T=4 and T=5.\n\nFreeway 5-8 always safe.\n\ny=9 no cars, safe.\n\ny=0 safe.\n\nNow, I start at turn 0, y=0.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nEach action changes y or not.\n\nI must avoid being on a freeway when it is unsafe at that time.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nFor row 1: unsafe only at T=2\n\nRow 2: unsafe only at T=2\n\nRow 3: unsafe at T=4 and T=5\n\nRow 4: unsafe at T=4 and T=5\n\nRow 5: always safe\n\nRow 6: always safe\n\nRow 7: always safe\n\nRow 8: always safe\n\nRow 3 and 4 are unsafe at T=4 and T=5.\n\nNow, since rows 5-8 are always safe, I can be on them any time without issue.\n\nSimilarly, rows 1 and 2 are safe except at T=2.\n\nNow, the problem is to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nMinimal turns would be to go up as fast as possible, but I have to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, if I go straight up with all U, starting at T=0, y=0.\n\nAfter first U, at T=1, y=1.\n\nAt T=1, y=1, row 1 is safe at T=1? Row 1 unsafe only at T=2, so at T=1, safe.\n\nThen after second U, at T=2, y=2.\n\nBut at T=2, y=2, row 2 is unsafe at T=2, since row 2 unsafe at T=2.\n\nCollision!\n\nAt turn T=2, I am on y=2, and row 2 is unsafe at that time.\n\nIf I go U at T=0: from y=0, after action, at T=1, y=1.\n\nAt T=1, on y=1, which is safe since only unsafe at T=2.\n\nThen U at T=1: at T=2, y=2, but on y=2 at T=2, unsafe.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf I do S at some point to delay.\n\nFor example, at T=0, I could do S, stay at y=0, then at T=1, still y=0.\n\nThen at T=1, I could go U to y=1 at T=2.\n\nAt T=2, y=1, row 1 is unsafe at T=2? Row 1 unsafe at T=2, yes.\n\nRow 1 and 2 both unsafe at T=2.\n\nSo at T=2, if I'm on y=1 or y=2, collision.\n\ny=1 at T=2: row 1 unsafe.\n\ny=2 at T=2: row 2 unsafe.\n\nNow, what about other times? Only at T=2 for rows 1-2.\n\nAt T=0, I'm on y=0, safe.\n\nIf I do S at T=0: at T=1, still y=0, safe.\n\nThen if I do U at T=1: at T=2, y=1, but row 1 unsafe at T=2, collision.\n\nIf I do D at T=0? But y=0, D would go to y=-1? But y must be in [0,9], so y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y, with y in [0,9], so if y=0 and D, y_{t+1} = max(0, -1)? The update says y_{t+1} in [0,9], so probably it clamps, but the equation says y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y, and y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if y=0 and D, y_{t+1} = 0, I think, since it can't go below 0.\n\nSimilarly for y=9 and U.\n\nSo at y=0, D is same as S, y stays 0.\n\nSimilarly at y=9, U same as S.\n\nSo D at y=0 is useless.\n\nSimilarly, only U and S matter at boundaries.\n\nBack to path.\n\nAt T=0, y=0.\n\nI need to avoid being on row 1 or 2 at T=2.\n\nAlso, for rows 3 and 4, avoid at T=4 and T=5.\n\nBut rows 3-4 unsafe at T=4,5, which is later.\n\nFirst, let's handle rows 1-2.\n\nThe only problem time is T=2 for rows 1 and 2.\n\nSo I need not to be on row 1 or 2 at turn T=2.\n\nSince row 1 and 2 are adjacent, and I have to pass through them, I need to be either below or above at T=2.\n\nFor example, at T=2, if I am on y=0, or y=3 or above, or below, but below is not possible since y=0 min.\n\ny=0, or y>=3.\n\nNow, from start, at T=0, y=0.\n\nIf I go U at T=0, to y=1 at T=1.\n\nThen at T=1, I can choose.\n\nIf I go U at T=1, to y=2 at T=2, but unsafe.\n\nIf I go S at T=1, stay at y=1, then at T=2, y=1, unsafe.\n\nIf I go D at T=1, but y=1, D to y=0 at T=2.\n\nThen at T=2, y=0, safe.\n\nBut y=0 is safe.\n\nThen at T=2, I'm at y=0.\n\nThen I can go up later.\n\nBut this takes extra turns.\n\nSince rows 5-8 are always safe, I could go up quickly to there, but I have to pass through 1-4.\n\nAnother idea: delay going up so that at T=2, I am still on y=0.\n\nFor example, at T=0, S, stay at y=0, T=1 y=0.\n\nThen at T=1, S again? But I need to go up.\n\nAt T=1, if I go U, to y=1 at T=2, unsafe.\n\nBut if I go U at T=1, to y=1 at T=2, unsafe.\n\nThe only way to avoid row 1 or 2 at T=2 is to be on y=0 at T=2.\n\nBecause if I am on y=1 or 2 at T=2, unsafe.\n\ny=0 is safe.\n\ny=3 or above, but at T=2, can I be on y=3?\n\nAt T=0, y=0.\n\nIf I go U at T=0, to y=1 at T=1.\n\nAt T=1, y=1.\n\nTo be at y=3 at T=2, I need to go U from y=1 to y=2 at T=2? But at T=2 y=2 is unsafe.\n\nFrom y=1 at T=1, if I go U, to y=2 at T=2, unsafe.\n\nIf I go S, y=1 at T=2, unsafe.\n\nIf I go D, to y=0 at T=2, safe.\n\nBut y=0.\n\nSo at T=2, I must be on y=0 to be safe.\n\nThen from there, I can start going up.\n\nBut now I have rows 3-4 unsafe at T=4 and T=5.\n\nFirst, let's get past rows 1-2.\n\nSo, one way: at T=0, S or D (same), stay at y=0, so at T=1, y=0.\n\nAt T=1, if I go U, to y=1 at T=2, unsafe.\n\nSo I cannot go U at T=1 if I want to be safe at T=2.\n\nAt T=1, I need to be at y=0 at T=2, so at T=1, from y=0, I can only S or D, stay at y=0, so at T=2, y=0.\n\nThen at T=2, I am at y=0, safe.\n\nNow, I can start moving up.\n\nAt T=2, y=0, I can go U to y=1 at T=3.\n\nNow, at T=3, y=1, row 1: is row 1 unsafe at T=3? Row 1 only unsafe at T=2, so at T=3, safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 2 unsafe only at T=2, so safe at T=3.\n\nThen I can go U to y=2 at T=4.\n\nAt T=4, y=2, row 2: safe? Row 2 unsafe only at T=2, so at T=4, safe.\n\nNow, from y=2 at T=4, I can go U to y=3 at T=5.\n\nBut now, row 3 is unsafe at T=4 and T=5.\n\nAt T=5, y=3, row 3 unsafe at T=5, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt T=4, I am on y=2.\n\nIf I go U to y=3 at T=5.\n\nAt T=5, y=3, row 3 unsafe.\n\nIf I stay at T=4, S, then at T=5, y=2, row 2 is safe at T=5? Only unsafe at T=2, so safe.\n\nBut I need to go to y=3 eventually.\n\nBut row 3 unsafe at T=4 and T=5.\n\nSo at T=4, if I am on y=2, I can go U to y=3 at T=5, but unsafe at T=5.\n\nOr stay at y=2 at T=5, safe, but then at T=5, y=2, I need to go to y=3 later.\n\nBut row 3 unsafe only at T=4 and T=5, so after T=5, it should be safe.\n\nAt T=6, row 3: for freeway 3, cars: we have the third car, at T=6, span [-35+36, -24+36]=[1,12], not including 0, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, T>5 safe for row 3.\n\nSimilarly row 4 same.\n\nSo at T=5, if I am on y=2, safe, since row 2 safe except T=2.\n\nThen at T=5, I can go U to y=3 at T=6.\n\nAt T=6, y=3, row 3 safe now.\n\nSimilarly, I can continue up.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nFirst, to avoid row 1-2 at T=2, I stayed at y=0 until T=2.\n\nAt T=0: S, so at T=1, y=0\n\nAt T=1: S or D, stay, at T=2, y=0\n\nNow at T=2: I go U, to y=1 at T=3\n\nAt T=3: go U, to y=2 at T=4\n\nAt T=4: now, if I go U to y=3 at T=5, but row 3 unsafe at T=5.\n\nIf I stay, S at T=4, to y=2 at T=5\n\nAt T=5: go U to y=3 at T=6\n\nThen at T=6: y=3, safe, since row 3 safe for T>=6 except we said safe after T=5.\n\nT=6>5, safe.\n\nThen from y=3, I can go up to y=4, etc.\n\nBut row 4 also unsafe at T=4 and T=5, but I'm not on row 4 yet.\n\nAt T=6, y=3, go U to y=4 at T=7\n\nAt T=7, y=4, row 4: unsafe at T=4,5, but T=7>5, safe.\n\nThen I can go up through 5,6,7,8 to 9.\n\nRows 5-8 always safe.\n\nSo let's list the actions and positions.\n\nTurn: actions at turn t, position after action, at time t+1? Let's clarify timing.\n\nDefine: at turn t, I perform action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nPosition at time t is y_t.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position (0, y_t), and I choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at (0, y_{t+1}), and so on.\n\nCollision at turn T if at that turn, when I am at y_T, if y_T between 1 and 8, and 0 in car span on row y_T at time T.\n\nStart: turn t=0, y_0 = 0.\n\nI need to reach y_T =9 for some T.\n\nSequence of actions a_0 to a_{H-1}, then after H actions, y_H =9.\n\nNow, for min H.\n\nIn my earlier plan:\n\nAt t=0: action a_0, to set y_1.\n\nI need to avoid y=1 or 2 at t=2? Turn t=2, position y_2.\n\nUnsafe if y_2=1 or 2 and t=2.\n\nSimilarly, for t=4 and t=5, if y_t=3 or 4, unsafe.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nStart t=0, y_0=0.\n\nI want y_2 not 1 or 2.\n\nSo y_2 =0 or >=3.\n\nBut from y_0=0, at t=0, I can choose a_0.\n\nIf a_0 = S or D, y_1 =0.\n\nThen at t=1, y_1=0.\n\nThen a_1, if a_1 = S or D, y_2=0.\n\nIf a_1 = U, y_2=1.\n\nBut y_2=1 at t=2 unsafe.\n\nSo to have y_2=0, I must do a_0 such that y_1=0, and a_1 such that y_2=0.\n\nSo at t=0 and t=1, I do S or D, but at y=0, D same as S, so I can do S both times.\n\na_0 = S, then y_1 = y_0 +0 =0\n\na_1 = S, y_2 = y_1 +0 =0\n\nAt t=2, y_2=0, safe.\n\nNow at t=2, I am at y_2=0, choose a_2.\n\nI can go U, so a_2 = U, then y_3 = y_2 +1 =1\n\nAt t=3, y_3=1, safe, since row 1 unsafe only at t=2.\n\nThen at t=3, a_3 = U, y_4 = y_3 +1 =2\n\nAt t=4, y_4=2, now row 2 unsafe only at t=2, so at t=4 safe.\n\nBut now, I need to go to y=3.\n\nIf I go U at t=4, a_4=U, y_5 = y_4 +1 =3\n\nBut at t=5, y_5=3, and row 3 unsafe at t=5, collision.\n\nIf I do S at t=4, a_4=S, y_5 = y_4 +0 =2\n\nAt t=5, y_5=2, row 2 safe.\n\nThen at t=5, a_5=U, y_6 = y_5 +1 =3\n\nAt t=6, y_6=3, now row 3: unsafe at t=4 and t=5, but t=6>5, safe.\n\nThen I can go up.\n\na_6 = U, y_7 = y_6 +1 =4\n\nAt t=7, y_7=4, row 4: unsafe at t=4,5, but t=7>5, safe.\n\nThen a_7 = U, y_8 =5\n\nAt t=8, y_8=5, row 5 always safe.\n\na_8 = U, y_9 =6\n\nt=9, y_9=6, safe.\n\na_9 = U, y_10 =7\n\nt=10, y_10=7, safe.\n\na_10 = U, y_11 =8\n\nt=11, y_11=8, safe.\n\na_11 = U, y_12 =9\n\nAt t=12, y_12=9, which is the goal.\n\nH is the number of actions, from a_0 to a_11, that's 12 actions, reaching y_12=9.\n\nBut min H should be less? With no cars, H=9, but here I have extra S actions.\n\nIn this sequence, I have:\n\nActions: t=0: S, t=1: S, t=2: U, t=3: U, t=4: S? In above, at t=4 I did S? Let's list:\n\nt=0: a_0=S, y_1=0\n\nt=1: a_1=S, y_2=0\n\nt=2: a_2=U, y_3=1\n\nt=3: a_3=U, y_4=2\n\nt=4: a_4=S, y_5=2  (stayed at y=2)\n\nt=5: a_5=U, y_6=3\n\nt=6: a_6=U, y_7=4\n\nt=7: a_7=U, y_8=5\n\nt=8: a_8=U, y_9=6\n\nt=9: a_9=U, y_10=7\n\nt=10: a_10=U, y_11=8\n\nt=11: a_11=U, y_12=9\n\nSo H=12 actions, from a_0 to a_11.\n\nBut at t=4, I did S to stay at y=2 to avoid being on y=3 at t=5.\n\nBut I could go directly to y=3 at a later time.\n\nAnother idea: instead of staying at y=0 for two turns, I could go up to y=2 before t=2 or after, but before not possible.\n\nt=2 is the only problem.\n\nSince rows 3-4 have later problems, I could go faster to higher rows.\n\nFor example, at t=0, go U, to y_1=1 at t=1.\n\nAt t=1, y_1=1, now if I go U, to y_2=2 at t=2, unsafe.\n\nBut I can go D at t=1, to y_2=0 at t=2, safe.\n\nThen at t=2, y_2=0.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nBut I have one U and one D, net no progress, and I used two actions to stay at 0.\n\nIn terms of net, I did U and D, back to 0, so wasted.\n\nIn the first approach, I did two S, also wasted.\n\nBut in the sequence above, I have to wait at y=2 for one turn.\n\nTotal actions: from y=0 to y=9, min 9 moves, but I have two S at start and one S at y=2, so 3 extra, H=12.\n\nBut perhaps I can avoid one S.\n\nFor rows 3-4, unsafe at t=4 and t=5.\n\nAt t=4, I was at y=2, which is safe.\n\nIf I could be at y=4 or above at t=4 or t=5, but from start, it might be tight.\n\nStart t=0 y=0.\n\nIf I go all U as fast as possible:\n\na_0=U, y1=1 at t=1\n\na_1=U, y2=2 at t=2, unsafe, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\na_0=S, y1=0\n\na_1=U, y2=1 at t=2, unsafe.\n\na_0=U, y1=1\n\na_1=S, y2=1 at t=2, unsafe.\n\na_0=U, y1=1\n\na_1=D, y2=0 at t=2, safe.\n\nThen at t=2, y2=0.\n\nNow from here, I can go up.\n\na_2=U, y3=1 at t=3, safe\n\na_3=U, y4=2 at t=4, safe since row 2 safe at t=4.\n\nNow at t=4, y4=2.\n\nI need to go to y=3.\n\nBut if a_4=U, y5=3 at t=5, unsafe.\n\na_4=S, y5=2 at t=5\n\nThen a_5=U, y6=3 at t=6, safe.\n\nThen continue up.\n\na_6=U, y7=4 at t=7, safe (row4 safe after t=5)\n\na_7=U, y8=5\n\na_8=U, y9=6\n\na_9=U, y10=7\n\na_10=U, y11=8\n\na_11=U, y12=9\n\nSame as before, 12 actions.\n\nIn this case, actions: a_0=U, a_1=D (net zero), a_2=U, a_3=U, a_4=S, a_5=U, a_6=U, a_7=U, a_8=U, a_9=U, a_10=U, a_11=U? Let's count.\n\nt=0: a_0=U, y1=1\n\nt=1: a_1=D, y2=0\n\nt=2: a_2=U, y3=1\n\nt=3: a_3=U, y4=2\n\nt=4: a_4=S, y5=2\n\nt=5: a_5=U, y6=3\n\nt=6: a_6=U, y7=4\n\nt=7: a_7=U, y8=5\n\nt=8: a_8=U, y9=6\n\nt=9: a_9=U, y10=7\n\nt=10: a_10=U, y11=8\n\nt=11: a_11=U, y12=9\n\nSo actions from a_0 to a_11, 12 actions.\n\nBut at t=6: y7=4, t=7: y8=5, etc.\n\ny from 3 to 4 at t=6 to t=7, etc.\n\nBut I have one D and one S, so extra.\n\nNow, back to rows 3-4, unsafe at t=4 and t=5.\n\nAt t=4, if I can be on y=3 or y=4 only if not unsafe, but y=3 unsafe at t=4 and t=5, y=4 unsafe at t=4 and t=5.\n\nSo at t=4 and t=5, I must not be on y=3 or 4.\n\nSo at t=4, I must be on y<=2 or y>=5.\n\nSimilarly at t=5, y<=2 or y>=5.\n\nNow, from start, how to reach y>=5 by t=4.\n\nt=4 is early.\n\nAt t=0, y0=0\n\nAfter one action, y1 <=1\n\nAfter two, y2 <=2\n\nAfter three, y3 <=3\n\nAfter four, y4 <=4\n\ny4 <=4, so y4 cannot be 5 or above.\n\nMax y at t=4 is 4, if all U.\n\nBut y=4 at t=4 is unsafe, since row 4 unsafe at t=4.\n\ny=3 at t=4 unsafe.\n\ny=2 at t=4 is safe, as we had.\n\ny=1 at t=4: row 1 unsafe only at t=2, so safe at t=4.\n\ny=0 safe.\n\nSimilarly at t=5, y<=5, min y=0.\n\ny=5 at t=5: row 5 always safe, so ok.\n\nBut at t=4, since y4 <=4, and y=3 or 4 unsafe, so I must be y4 <=2 or y=4 but unsafe, so only y4 <=2 is safe at t=4.\n\nSimilarly at t=5, I must not be on y=3 or 4, so y5 <=2 or y5 >=5.\n\nNow y5 can be up to 5.\n\nBut at t=4, I must have y4 <=2.\n\nThen from y4 <=2 at t=4, to y5 at t=5.\n\nIf y4 <=2, then at t=4, action a_4.\n\nIf I go U, y5 = y4 +1 <=3\n\nIf y5=3, and at t=5, unsafe if y5=3.\n\nIf y4 <=1, y5 <=2, which is <=2, safe at t=5 since y=0,1,2 safe except row1 and2 at t=2, but t=5 not t=2.\n\nRow 1 and 2 only unsafe at t=2, so at t=5, y=1 or 2 is safe.\n\ny=0 safe.\n\nIf y4=2, and I go U, y5=3, unsafe at t=5.\n\nIf I stay, y5=2, safe.\n\nIf I go D, y5=1, safe.\n\nThen later go up.\n\nBut to reach y=9, I need to go up.\n\nIn the sequence, with y4 <=2, and at t=5, y5 <=2 or if y5=5, but from y4<=2, y5 <=3, so y5 cannot be 5, so y5 <=3.\n\nThus at t=5, y5 <=3, so to be safe, y5 must be <=2, since y=3 unsafe.\n\nSo if y4 <=2, and I do not go U to y=3, but stay or go down, so y5 <=2.\n\nThen at t=5, y5 <=2, safe.\n\nThen after t=5, I can go up freely since rows 3-4 safe after t=5, and 5-8 always safe.\n\nNow, in terms of min time, I need to reach y=9 asap.\n\nBut I have to have y4 <=2 and y5 <=2.\n\nIn the earlier sequence, I had y4=2 and y5=2, by staying.\n\nI could have y4 lower.\n\nBut to minimize H, I should go up as fast as possible except when forced to wait.\n\nNow, for rows 1-2, I need to avoid t=2.\n\nSo I must have y2=0.\n\nBecause if y2=1 or 2, unsafe.\n\ny2=0.\n\nThen from there, go up.\n\ny2=0 at t=2.\n\nThen y3, at t=3, I can go to y3=1 or more.\n\nBut y3 <=3? From y2=0, a_2=U, y3=1; or S, y3=0; D, y3=0.\n\nSo y3 <=1 at t=3.\n\nThen a_3=U, y4=2 (if y3=1) or less.\n\ny4 <=2.\n\nAt t=4, y4 <=2, as required.\n\nThen at t=4, I need to set y5 <=2.\n\nSo if y4 <=2, I can do S or D to stay or decrease, so y5 <= y4 <=2.\n\nThen at t=5, y5 <=2, safe.\n\nThen from t=5, I can go all U to 9.\n\ny5 <=2.\n\nThen from y5, I need to go to y=9, which is 7 steps up (y5 to y6, ..., y12=9 if y5=2? y5=2, y6=3, y7=4, y8=5, y9=6, y10=7, y11=8, y12=9, so 7 U actions from t=5 to t=11.\n\nBut y5 at t=5, actions from t=5 to t=11 for 7 steps? Let's see.\n\nAt t=5, y5 <=2.\n\nSet y5 = k <=2.\n\nThen I need to increase to 9, so (9 - k) U actions, no S or D, so from t=5 to t=5 + (9-k) -1? Actions.\n\nAfter m U actions, y increases by m.\n\nFrom y5, to reach y_{t} =9.\n\nLet say at turn t, y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta.\n\nSo from y_t, to reach y_{t+H} =9 with H actions.\n\nBut I need min time to reach.\n\nSince from t=5, y5 <=2, and I can go all U, each U increases y by 1, so to reach y=9, I need (9 - y5) U actions.\n\nStarting from t=5, after first U at t=5, y6 = y5 +1\n\nAfter second, y7 = y5 +2\n\n...\n\nAfter m-th U, y_{5+m} = y5 + m\n\nSet y5 + m =9, so m =9 - y5\n\nThus at time t=5 + m =5 + (9 - y5)\n\nSince y5 <=2, min time when y5=2, then m=7, reach at t=5+7=12.\n\nIf y5=1, m=8, reach at t=13, worse.\n\ny5=0, m=9, t=14, worse.\n\nSo best to have y5=2 at t=5, then reach at t=12 with y12=9.\n\nHow to get to y5=2.\n\nAt t=2, y2=0.\n\nThen from t=2 to t=5, three actions: a_2, a_3, a_4, to set y5.\n\ny5 = y2 + (number U - number D) from t=2 to t=4 actions? Actions at t=2,3,4 affect y3,y4,y5.\n\nAt t=2, action a_2, sets y3\n\na_3 sets y4\n\na_4 sets y5\n\ny3 = y2 + Delta a_2\n\nSince y2=0, y3 = 0 + Delta a_2\n\nSimilarly y4 = y3 + Delta a_3\n\ny5 = y4 + Delta a_4\n\nI want y5=2.\n\nAlso, during this, I need to be safe at each turn.\n\nAt t=3, y3 must be safe.\n\ny3: since rows 1-2 safe except t=2, and t=3>2, so y=1 or 2 safe at t=3.\n\nSimilarly at t=4, y4 must be safe; y4 <=2 as before, and rows 1-2 safe at t=4, row 3 unsafe but y4<=2, so not row 3, so safe.\n\nSimilarly at t=5, y5<=2, safe as above.\n\nNow, to have y5=2.\n\ny2=0\n\ny3 = Delta a_2, which can be -1,0,1, but y in [0,9], so Delta a_2: if U, y3=1; S or D, y3=0\n\nSimilarly, y4 = y3 + Delta a_3\n\ny5 = y4 + Delta a_4\n\nI want y5=2.\n\nPossible sequences:\n\nFor example, a_2=U, then y3=1\n\nThen a_3=U, y4=2\n\nThen a_4=S or D, y5=2? If a_4=S, y5=y4=2; if a_4=D, y5=1 if y4=2, but I want y5=2, so a_4=S.\n\ny4=2, a_4=S, y5=2.\n\na_4=D, y5=1.\n\nBut I want y5=2, so a_4=S.\n\na_2=U, y3=1\n\na_3=S, y4=1\n\nThen a_4=U, y5=2\n\nAlso possible.\n\na_2=U, y3=1\n\na_3=D, y4=0? Then a_4=U, y5=1, not 2.\n\nWorse.\n\na_2=S, y3=0\n\nThen a_3=U, y4=1\n\na_4=U, y5=2\n\nAlso possible.\n\na_2=S, y3=0\n\na_3=S, y4=0\n\na_4=U, y5=1, not 2.\n\nOr a_4=U, y5=1.\n\nTo get y5=2, I need to have two U in the three actions, or something.\n\ny5 = y2 + (U from t=2,3,4) - (D from t=2,3,4)\n\nSince S no change.\n\ny2=0, so y5 = number U - number D in actions at t=2,3,4.\n\nAnd since y3 and y4 must be between 0 and 9, but with y5=2, and U and D, it should be fine.\n\nNow, number U minus number D = y5 - y2 =2 -0=2.\n\nSince y5=2, y2=0.\n\nAnd number of actions is 3, so U - D =2, and U + D + S =3.\n\nPossible: two U and one S, then U - D =2, D=0.\n\nOr three U, U - D =3 if D=0, but U - D = U if D=0, so if three U, U - D=3, y5=3, but we want y5=2, so not.\n\nIf two U and one D, U - D =2 -1=1, y5=1, not 2.\n\nIf one U and two S, U - D=1, y5=1.\n\nSo only possibility: two U and one S, with D=0, so U - D =2.\n\nThus actions: two U and one S in some order.\n\nNow, positions:\n\nFor example:\n\nOption 1: a_2=U, y3=1\n\na_3=U, y4=2\n\na_4=S, y5=2\n\nAt t=3, y3=1, safe\n\nt=4, y4=2, safe\n\nt=5, y5=2, safe\n\nOption 2: a_2=U, y3=1\n\na_3=S, y4=1\n\na_4=U, y5=2\n\nt=3, y3=1, safe\n\nt=4, y4=1, safe (row1 safe at t=4)\n\nt=5, y5=2, safe\n\nOption 3: a_2=S, y3=0\n\na_3=U, y4=1\n\na_4=U, y5=2\n\nt=3, y3=0, safe\n\nt=4, y4=1, safe\n\nt=5, y5=2, safe\n\nAll fine.\n\nThen from here, at t=5, y5=2\n\nThen a_5=U, y6=3\n\nAt t=6, y6=3, safe (t=6>5)\n\na_6=U, y7=4\n\nt=7, y7=4, safe (t=7>5)\n\na_7=U, y8=5\n\nt=8, y8=5, safe\n\na_8=U, y9=6\n\nt=9, y9=6, safe\n\na_9=U, y10=7\n\nt=10, y10=7, safe\n\na_10=U, y11=8\n\nt=11, y11=8, safe\n\na_11=U, y12=9\n\nt=12, y12=9, reached.\n\nNow, earlier at t=0 and t=1, I had to set y2=0.\n\nAt t=0: to have y2=0, since y0=0, I need y1=0 and a_1 such that y2=0.\n\ny1 = y0 + Delta a_0\n\nIf a_0 = S or D, y1=0\n\nThen a_1 must be S or D, so y2=0.\n\nIf a_0=U, y1=1, then a_1 must be D, so y2=0.\n\nIn the case where a_0=U and a_1=D, I have an extra D, but in the end, when I go from y5=2 to y12=9, I have 7 U, but net from start.\n\nBut in terms of actions, same number.\n\nTo have y2=0 with min actions.\n\nFrom y0=0, to y2=0.\n\nActions at t=0 and t=1.\n\nIf both S: y1=0, y2=0\n\nOr a_0=U, a_1=D: y1=1, y2=0\n\nIn both cases, two actions, net zero.\n\nNo saving.\n\nIn the sequence, I can choose.\n\nFor example, take option for the later part.\n\nTo have fewer S or D.\n\nIn the sequence to y5=2, I need two U and one S in t=2,3,4.\n\nIn the up part, all U.\n\nNow for the beginning, to set y2=0.\n\nI can do a_0=S, a_1=S, then a_2=U, etc.\n\nOr a_0=U, a_1=D, then a_2=U, etc.\n\nIn the second case, I have a D action, which might be similar to S.\n\nBut in terms of the sequence, I can avoid D if I want, but not necessary.\n\nNow, for min H, H=12.\n\nBut is it possible with H=11?\n\nSuppose H=11, then y_{11}=9.\n\nSince start y0=0, end y11=9, so U - D =9, and U + D + S =11.\n\nSo 9 + 2D + S =11, so 2D + S =2.\n\nThus either D=1 and S=0, or D=0 and S=2, or D=0 S=2, or D=1 S=0, etc.\n\nNow, I need to reach without collision.\n\nNow, y2 must be 0 to avoid t=2.\n\ny2=0.\n\nThen y5 must be <=2, but to reach y11=9, from y2=0, after 9 actions? From y2 to y11.\n\nActions from t=2 to t=10, 9 actions, to set y11.\n\ny11 = y2 + (U - D) from t=2 to t=10.\n\ny2=0, y11=9, so U - D =9.\n\nActions from t=2 to t=10 inclusive? Actions at t=2 to t=10, that's 9 actions: a_2 to a_10, which set y3 to y11.\n\ny3 = y2 + Delta a_2\n\n...\n\ny11 = y10 + Delta a_10\n\nSo y11 = y2 + sum_{k=2 to 10} Delta a_k\n\nSince each Delta is -1,0,1.\n\ny11 - y2 = sum Delta from t=2 to t=10, 9 terms.\n\ny11=9, y2=0, so sum Delta =9.\n\nSince each |Delta|<=1, all Delta must be +1, so all U from t=2 to t=10.\n\nThus a_2 to a_10 all U.\n\nThen y3=1, y4=2, y5=3, y6=4, y7=5, y8=6, y9=7, y10=8, y11=9.\n\nNow, check collisions.\n\nAt t=2: y2=0, safe.\n\nBut y2=0, and we are checking at turn t, position y_t.\n\nAt t=2, y2=0, safe.\n\nAt t=3, y3=1, row 1: unsafe only at t=2, so safe at t=3.\n\nAt t=4, y4=2, row 2: unsafe only at t=2, so safe at t=4.\n\nAt t=5, y5=3, row 3: unsafe at t=4 and t=5, so at t=5, y5=3, row 3 unsafe, collision.\n\nThus not possible.\n\nIf I have S or D somewhere, but with all U from t=2, I must have y5=3 at t=5, unsafe.\n\nTo avoid, I need y5 not 3 at t=5, but with all U, y5=3.\n\nIf I have S or D, but in H=11, with y2=0 and all U to t=10, I have y5=3 at t=5.\n\nBut I must have y5 <=2 to be safe at t=5, but here y5=3, unsafe.\n\nIf I don't have all U, but with sum Delta=9 in 9 actions, must all be U.\n\nThus impossible for H=11.\n\nSimilarly, for H=10, even worse.\n\ny11=9 with 11 actions.\n\nWith H=10 actions, y10=9.\n\nThen from y0=0 to y10=9, U - D =9, U+D+S=10, so 9 + 2D + S =10, 2D+S=1, so either D=0 S=1 or D=1 S=0.\n\nBut y2 must be 0.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=9, 10 actions.\n\ny10=9.\n\ny2=0.\n\nThen from t=2 to t=9, 8 actions to go from y2=0 to y10=9? y10 = y2 + sum_{k=2 to 9} Delta a_k\n\ny10=9, y2=0, so sum_{k=2 to9} Delta =9, but only 8 actions, impossible since each Delta <=1, sum <=8 <9.\n\nContradiction.\n\nThus H=10 impossible.\n\nSimilarly H=11 impossible as above.\n\nH=12 is possible, as we have sequence.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I need to output the actions.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be for turn t1, which is 0.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I have different options.\n\nFor example, beginning: I can do a0 and a1 both S, or a0=U and a1=D.\n\nSimilarly, for the middle, I can choose how to get to y5=2.\n\nTo minimize something, but since all lead to H=12, I can choose one.\n\nPerhaps with fewer S or D, but not necessary.\n\nNow, the car state has freeway 3 and 4 with multiple cars, but we considered.\n\nFreeway 5-8 no issue.\n\nIn the sequence, let's write one.\n\nFor example:\n\nStart at t=0, y0=0\n\na0 = S  (stay)\n\ny1=0\n\na1 = S  (stay)\n\ny2=0\n\na2 = U  (up)\n\ny3=1\n\na3 = U  (up)\n\ny4=2\n\na4 = S  (stay)  // to keep y5=2\n\ny5=2\n\na5 = U  (up)\n\ny6=3\n\na6 = U  (up)\n\ny7=4\n\na7 = U  (up)\n\ny8=5\n\na8 = U  (up)\n\ny9=6\n\na9 = U  (up)\n\ny10=7\n\na10 = U  (up)\n\ny11=8\n\na11 = U  (up)\n\ny12=9\n\nReached at t=12.\n\nActions from a0 to a11.\n\nIn the sequence, a4 is S.\n\nI could do a4 differently, but in this case, to have y5=2 with y4=2, I did S.\n\nAnother option: at a2=U, y3=1\n\na3=S, y4=1\n\na4=U, y5=2\n\nThen same from there.\n\na5=U, etc.\n\nBut in this case, at a3=S, I stayed at y=1 for one turn.\n\nBut similar.\n\nI could have a2=S, y3=0\n\na3=U, y4=1\n\na4=U, y5=2\n\nThen a5=U, y6=3, etc.\n\nBut again, H same.\n\nNow, in the output, I need to list the actions for each turn.\n\nAlso, for the cars, freeway 3 and 4 have multiple cars, but we only cared about the one that covers 0, which is the third car at T=4,5.\n\nSimilarly for row 4.\n\nBut in row 3, at T=4 and 5, unsafe, which we avoided.\n\nNow, I think H=12 is minimal.\n\nBut let me confirm the car positions.\n\nFor example, on row 3 at T=4: car spans.\n\nThird car: at T=4, [-35 + 6*4, -24 + 6*4] = [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11, 0], so 0 included.\n\nSimilarly T=5: [-35+30, -24+30] = [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nOther cars not covering 0.\n\nSimilarly for row 4 same.\n\nOther rows fine.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I have at t=4, y4=2, not on row 3 or 4.\n\nt=5, y5=2, not on 3 or 4.\n\nt=6, y6=3, row 3 at t=6: car span [-35+36, -24+36]=[1,12], 0 not included, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo all good.\n\nNow for the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nSince t1=0, turns from t=0 to t=11.\n\nAnswer format:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nUp to the last action.\n\nt1=0, so Turn 0: a_0\n\nTurn 1: a_1\n\n...\n\nTurn 11: a_11\n\nIn my sequence, I have a0=S, a1=S, a2=U, a3=U, a4=S, a5=U, a6=U, a7=U, a8=U, a9=U, a10=U, a11=U\n\nBut a10 and a11 are for y10 and y11.\n\nIn the sequence above, a11=U, y12=9.\n\nNow, I can write the actions.\n\nTo avoid S, I could use the alternative with D, but D is fine.\n\nSince in the beginning, I can do a0=U, a1=D, which has a D, but same.\n\nBut I think S is fine.\n\nNow, for the middle, I can avoid S at a4 by doing different.\n\nFor example, in the option where a2=U, a3=S, a4=U, so a4=U, no S.\n\nThen sequence:\n\na0=S, a1=S, a2=U, a3=S, a4=U, a5=U, a6=U, a7=U, a8=U, a9=U, a10=U, a11=U\n\nNow, positions:\n\nt=0: a0=S, y1=0\n\nt=1: a1=S, y2=0\n\nt=2: a2=U, y3=1\n\nt=3: a3=S, y4=1\n\nt=4: a4=U, y5=2\n\nt=5: a5=U, y6=3\n\nt=6: a6=U, y7=4\n\nt=7: a7=U, y8=5\n\nt=8: a8=U, y9=6\n\nt=9: a9=U, y10=7\n\nt=10: a10=U, y11=8\n\nt=11: a11=U, y12=9\n\nAt t=3, a3=S, y4=1, which is row 1, but at t=4, row 1 safe, since only unsafe at t=2.\n\nAt t=4, y4=1, row 1 safe.\n\nThen a4=U, to y5=2 at t=5, row 2 safe at t=5.\n\nThen a5=U to y6=3 at t=6, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nAnd I have one S at a3, but no S later except that.\n\nIn previous I had S at a4.\n\nBut here a4=U.\n\nNow, actions: a0=S, a1=S, a2=U, a3=S, a4=U, then all U to a11.\n\na5 to a11 are U, that's 7 U.\n\nFrom a4=U at t=4, to a11 at t=11, but a4 sets y5=2, a5 sets y6=3, ..., a11 sets y12=9, so a4 to a11 is 8 actions? t=4 to t=11, 8 actions: a4 to a11.\n\ny after a4: y5=2\n\na5: y6=3\n\na6: y7=4\n\na7: y8=5\n\na8: y9=6\n\na9: y10=7\n\na10: y11=8\n\na11: y12=9\n\nYes, 8 actions from a4 to a11, but y from 2 to 9, 7 steps, but with 8 actions? y5=2 to y12=9, that's 7 increases, but 8 actions? Let's see: after a4, y5=2; after a5, y6=3; ... after a11, y12=9. So from y5=2 to y12=9, it took 7 U actions: a5 to a11? a5 sets y6=3, which is first increase; a6 sets y7=4, second; ... a11 sets y12=9, that's from y6=3 to y12=9, 6 increases? Messy.\n\nBetter not to count.\n\nAt t=4, after a4, y5=2.\n\nThen to reach y=9, I need y_{t} =9 for some t.\n\nAfter k U actions, y increases by k.\n\nSo from y5=2, after m U actions, y_{5+m} = 2 + m\n\nSet 2 + m =9, m=7.\n\nThus at time t=5 + m =5+7=12, y12=9.\n\nActions from a5 to a11, that's 7 actions: a5 to a11 set y6 to y12.\n\na5 sets y6, a6 sets y7, ..., a11 sets y12.\n\nYes, 7 actions to go from y5=2 to y12=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions a0 to a11: 12 actions.\n\nIn the list: a0=S, a1=S, a2=U, a3=S, a4=U, a5=U, a6=U, a7=U, a8=U, a9=U, a10=U, a11=U\n\nNow, I can output this.\n\nBut a3=S is a stay.\n\nSince y=0 to y=9, min 9 actions, but with 3 extra: two S at start and one S at t=3.\n\nBut necessary.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 0: S\n\nTurn 1: S\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 3: S, which is fine.\n\nTo have fewer S, but in the beginning I could do a0=U, a1=D.\n\nThen:\n\na0=U, y1=1\n\na1=D, y2=0\n\nThen a2=U, y3=1\n\na3=U, y4=2\n\na4=S, y5=2 // or other\n\nBut then a4=S.\n\nIf I do a2=U, y3=1\n\na3=S, y4=1\n\na4=U, y5=2\n\nThen no S at a4, but S at a3.\n\nSame as before.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n\nNow, in the car state, freeway 5-8 have cars but they never cover 0, so safe.\n\nAlso, in the output, I need to box the answer.\n\nSo I'll go with the sequence above.\n\nBut let's write it properly.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 0\\) is 12, with the sequence of actions avoiding all collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Collision Analysis:\n- **Freeways 1 and 2**: Unsafe only at turn \\(t = 2\\) due to cars covering \\(x = 0\\).\n- **Freeways 3 and 4**: Unsafe at turns \\(t = 4\\) and \\(t = 5\\) due to the third car covering \\(x = 0\\).\n- **Freeways 5 to 8**: Always safe, as no car covers \\(x = 0\\) at any turn.\n- \\(y = 0\\) and \\(y = 9\\) are safe, with no cars present.\n\nTo minimize \\(H\\), the player must:\n- Avoid being on freeways 1 or 2 at \\(t = 2\\) by staying at \\(y = 0\\) until after \\(t = 2\\).\n- Avoid being on freeways 3 or 4 at \\(t = 4\\) and \\(t = 5\\) by ensuring \\(y \\leq 2\\) at these turns.\n- After \\(t = 5\\), all freeways are safe, so the player can move directly upward to \\(y = 9\\) with all \"U\" actions.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence ensures:\n- At \\(t = 2\\), \\(y = 0\\) (safe).\n- At \\(t = 4\\), \\(y = 1\\) (safe, as freeway 1 is only unsafe at \\(t = 2\\)).\n- At \\(t = 5\\), \\(y = 2\\) (safe, as freeway 2 is only unsafe at \\(t = 2\\) and \\(y = 2 \\leq 2\\) avoids freeways 3/4).\n- From \\(t = 6\\) onward, the player moves upward safely to \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThe actions are:\n- Turn 0: S (stay at \\(y = 0\\) to avoid moving to \\(y = 1\\) at \\(t = 1\\) prematurely).\n- Turn 1: S (stay at \\(y = 0\\) to ensure \\(y = 0\\) at \\(t = 2\\), avoiding freeways 1/2).\n- Turn 2: U (move to \\(y = 1\\) at \\(t = 3\\), safe as freeway 1 is unsafe only at \\(t = 2\\)).\n- Turn 3: S (stay at \\(y = 1\\) to avoid moving to \\(y = 2\\) at \\(t = 4\\) prematurely; freeway 1 is safe at \\(t = 4\\)).\n- Turn 4: U (move to \\(y = 2\\) at \\(t = 5\\), safe as freeway 2 is unsafe only at \\(t = 2\\) and \\(y = 2 \\leq 2\\) avoids freeways 3/4 at \\(t = 5\\)).\n- Turns 5 to 11: U (move upward directly to \\(y = 9\\), as all freeways are safe after \\(t = 5\\)).\n\nThis sequence has \\(H = 12\\) actions, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 12.\n\n### Output in Required Format:\n\\boxed{\nTurn 0: S \\\\\nTurn 1: S \\\\\nTurn 2: U \\\\\nTurn 3: S \\\\\nTurn 4: U \\\\\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: U \\\\\nTurn 10: U \\\\\nTurn 11: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 0) at turn t_1, which is turn 1. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. Each turn, the player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision happens if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The note says that when you move to a new row, you're not considered on that row until the next turn. So if you move to y_{T+1} at turn T, you're on y_T at turn T, and on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe car states are given for each freeway k (which I assume corresponds to y=k). Let me list out the cars for each row:\n\n- Freeway 1 (y=1): one car: (head=12, tail=47, direction=left, speed=36)\n\nDirection left means it's moving left, so span decreases over time.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, (12,47,left,36)\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: (54,43,right,6), (18,7,right,6), (-18,-29,right,6)\n\nDirection right means moving right, so span increases.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 4: same as freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 5: one car: (54,43,right,6)\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (54,43,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7: one car: (54,43,right,6)\n\nFreeway 8: one car: (54,43,right,6)\n\nI need to find when these cars have 0 in their span at different turns.\n\nFirst, let's define the span at turn T relative to turn t_1.\n\nLet Δt = T - t_1\n\nFor a car at time t_1, span is [h, τ] for left-moving, or [τ, h] for right-moving? The notation is a bit messy.\n\nLooking back:\n\nFor left-moving: at t_1, span is [h, τ], and at T, it becomes [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt]\n\nIn the example, for left: (12,47,left,36), so h=12, τ=47. Since it's left-moving, head is at 12, tail at 47? That seems odd because if it's moving left, the head should be the leading part, but 12 to 47, if moving left, decreasing, head at 47 might make more sense? I think there's inconsistency.\n\nLook: \"left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 1: (12,47,left,36), so h=12, τ=47. If moving left, decreasing positions, so at t_1, from 12 to 47? But 12 to 47 is increasing, so if moving left, it should be from higher to lower.\n\nPerhaps h and τ are positions, but for left-moving, h is the head (front) and τ is tail, so if moving left, head should be on the left, so h > τ.\n\nIn this case, for freeway 1: h=12, τ=47, but 12 < 47, so if moving left, head at 12, tail at 47 doesn't make sense because 12 is left of 47? I think I need to assume the coordinate system.\n\nThe freeway is a number line, and cars occupy a segment. For left-moving, the car is moving to decreasing x, so head has smaller x if we assume x increases right.\n\nDefine x-axis: let's say x=0 is the point we care about for collision. Cars are on the freeway, and we need to know if x=0 is occupied at turn T.\n\nFor a car, span at T is the interval it occupies.\n\nFor left-moving car: at t_1, span [h, τ] with h and τ such that if moving left, the head is at min position? The update is [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt], so the positions decrease.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1: (12,47,left,36), so at t_1, span is [12,47], meaning from x=12 to x=47. Since moving left, at time T, span is [12 - 36Δt, 47 - 36Δt].\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: (54,43,right,6), but h=54, τ=43, and it says [τ, h] for right-moving? Let's see the text.\n\n\"Right-moving: [Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), but for right-moving, head and tail might be defined differently.\n\nFor freeway 3: (54,43,right,6), and it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h] for right-moving, so here h=54, τ=43, so [τ, h] = [43,54], so at t_1, from 43 to 54.\n\nThen at T, [43 + 6Δt, 54 + 6Δt]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAlso, for the car (-18,-29,right,6), [τ, h] = [-29,-18]? τ=-29, h=-18, so [τ, h] = [-29,-18], then at T, [-29 + 6Δt, -18 + 6Δt]\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in the span of that car at turn T.\n\nSince the player is at x=0 always, I think, but the position is (0, y), so x=0, y varies. So for collision, when on row y at turn T, if there is a car on that row with 0 in its span at T.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when 0 is not occupied, i.e., for which turns T, 0 is not in any car's span on that row.\n\nBut since multiple cars per row, I need the union of their spans.\n\nAlso, the player starts at y=0, and needs to go to y=9. y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, no cars, since cars are only on y=1 to 8.\n\nThe problem says \"freeways y=1,…,8\", so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars.\n\nSo at turn t_1=1, player at (0,0).\n\nI need to go to (0,9) as fast as possible.\n\nActions: U, D, S.\n\nSince we need to go up, probably mostly U, but need to avoid rows when they are occupied at x=0.\n\nNow, let's analyze for each row, the times when x=0 is occupied.\n\nFirst, for freeway y=1: one car: (12,47,left,36)\n\nAt t_1=1, span [12,47]\n\nAt turn T, span [12 - 36(T-1), 47 - 36(T-1)]\n\n0 in span when min ≤ 0 ≤ max, so 12 - 36(T-1) ≤ 0 ≤ 47 - 36(T-1)\n\nSimilarly for other inequalities.\n\nSet Δt = T - t_1 = T - 1\n\nSo for y=1 car: 0 in span if 12 - 36 Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 47 - 36 Δt\n\nThat is, 12 - 36 Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 47 - 36 Δt\n\nFirst inequality: 12 - 36 Δt ≤ 0 => 12 ≤ 36 Δt => Δt ≥ 12/36 = 1/3\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ 47 - 36 Δt => 36 Δt ≤ 47 => Δt ≤ 47/36 ≈ 1.3056\n\nSo for Δt from 1/3 to 47/36, approximately 0.333 to 1.3056\n\nSince Δt = T-1, T from 1 + 0.333 = 1.333 to 1 + 1.3056 = 2.3056\n\nBut turns are integers, so at which integer T is 0 occupied?\n\nT must be integer, so for T=2: Δt=1, 12-36(1) = 12-36= -24 ≤0, and 0 ≤47-36=11, yes 0≤11 true, so occupied at T=2.\n\nT=1: Δt=0, 12-0=12>0? 12 -0 =12, 12 ≤0? 12 ≤0 false, so not occupied at T=1.\n\nT=2: Δt=1, min=12-36=-24≤0, max=47-36=11≥0, yes.\n\nT=3: Δt=2, min=12-72=-60≤0, max=47-72=-25<0, so 0 not ≤ -25? 0 ≤ -25 false, so not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, T=1 not occupied, T=2 occupied, T=3 not, etc.\n\nSo for y=1, occupied at T=2 only? T=2 is occupied.\n\nΔt from 1/3 to 47/36≈1.305, so for integer T, only T=2 has Δt=1 within [1/3, 1.305], T=1 Δt=0 not in, T=2 Δt=1 in, T=3 Δt=2=2>1.305 not in.\n\nSo y=1 is occupied only at turn T=2.\n\nNow freeway y=2: same as y=1, car (12,47,left,36), so same as above, occupied only at T=2.\n\nNow freeway y=3: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (54,43,right,6)\n\nFor right-moving, span at t_1: [τ,h] = [43,54] since τ=43, h=54? Earlier: (54,43,right,6), and for right, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], τ=43, h=54, so [43,54]\n\nAt T, [43 + 6 Δt, 54 + 6 Δt]\n\n0 in span if 43 + 6 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 54 + 6 Δt? No.\n\nSpan [a,b] with a=43+6Δt, b=54+6Δt, a<b since moving right.\n\n0 in [a,b] if a ≤ 0 ≤ b.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo for this car: a = 43 + 6 Δt, b=54 + 6 Δt\n\n0 in span if 43 + 6 Δt ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 54 + 6 Δt\n\nFirst: 43 + 6 Δt ≤ 0 => 6 Δt ≤ -43 => Δt ≤ -43/6 ≈ -7.166, but Δt = T-1 ≥0 since T≥1, so impossible. Thus this car never has 0 in span because at t_1, min is 43>0, and increasing, so always positive, never reaches 0.\n\nSimilarly, second car on y=3: (18,7,right,6)\n\nτ=18? Head and tail: (18,7,right,6), so τ=7, h=18? Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [7,18] for right-moving.\n\nAt T, [7 + 6 Δt, 18 + 6 Δt]\n\n0 in span if 7 + 6 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 18 + 6 Δt\n\nFirst: 7 + 6 Δt ≤ 0 => 6 Δt ≤ -7 => Δt ≤ -7/6 ≈ -1.166, impossible for Δt≥0.\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ 18 + 6 Δt always true since Δt≥0.\n\nBut first inequality false, so never occupied by this car.\n\nThird car on y=3: (-18,-29,right,6)\n\n(-18,-29,right,6), so h=-18, τ=-29? Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [-29,-18]\n\nAt T, [-29 + 6 Δt, -18 + 6 Δt]\n\n0 in span if -29 + 6 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -18 + 6 Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -29 + 6 Δt ≤ 0 => 6 Δt ≤ 29 => Δt ≤ 29/6 ≈ 4.833\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -18 + 6 Δt => 18 ≤ 6 Δt => Δt ≥ 18/6 = 3\n\nSo for Δt from 3 to 4.833, so integer Δt: 3,4\n\nΔt=3: T-1=3, T=4\n\nΔt=4: T-1=4, T=5\n\nT=4 and T=5\n\nNow, for other cars on y=3, first two never cover 0, so only this third car matters.\n\nThus for y=3, occupied at T=4 and T=5.\n\nNow freeway y=4: same as y=3, three cars, same as above, so occupied at T=4 and T=5.\n\nNow freeway y=5: one car: (54,43,right,6)\n\nSimilar to first car on y=3, span [43,54] at t_1, moving right, min 43>0, increasing, so 0 never in span. So y=5 is always safe, no car covers 0 at any time.\n\nSimilarly, freeway y=6: one car (54,43,right,6), same as above, always safe.\n\ny=7: same, (54,43,right,6), always safe.\n\ny=8: same, (54,43,right,6), always safe.\n\ny=5,6,7,8 all have the same car (54,43,right,6), which never covers 0, so these rows are always safe to be on.\n\ny=1 occupied only at T=2\n\ny=2 occupied only at T=2\n\ny=3 occupied at T=4 and T=5\n\ny=4 occupied at T=4 and T=5\n\ny=5,6,7,8 always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at t=1, y=0.\n\nGoal: reach y=9.\n\nNeed to move from y=0 to y=9, but can only change y by at most 1 per turn.\n\nMinimal turns: since from 0 to 9, at least 9 moves up, but we can stay or move down, but to minimize turns, probably only move up, but we might need to stay or move down to avoid being on a row when it's occupied.\n\nBut in this case, the dangerous rows are y=1 and y=2 at t=2, and y=3 and y=4 at t=4 and t=5.\n\ny=1 and y=2 are only dangerous at t=2, and safe at other times.\n\nSimilarly y=3 and y=4 dangerous at t=4 and t=5.\n\nNow, since we need to go through all rows, but we can time when we are on each row.\n\nPlayer position at turn T: y_T\n\nStart at t=1, y=0.\n\nAt each turn, we choose action, which determines y_{T+1} based on y_T and action.\n\nLet’s denote the turn and y.\n\nt=1: y=0, which is safe.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\nThe critical points:\n\n- If we are on y=1 at t=2, collision, since occupied.\n\nSimilarly, on y=2 at t=2, collision.\n\nOn y=3 at t=4 or t=5, collision.\n\nOn y=4 at t=4 or t=5, collision.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nNow, since y=5 to y=8 are always safe, no issue.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nNow, to minimize H, we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on bad row at bad time.\n\nStart at t=1, y=0.\n\nAfter one action, at t=2, we can be at y=0,1, or -1 but y=0 min, so y=0 or 1.\n\nBut if we move to y=1 at t=2, collision, since y=1 occupied at t=2.\n\nIf we stay at y=0 at t=2, safe.\n\nSimilarly, from t=1 to t=2:\n\nAction at t=1: if U, then y=1 at t=2, but collision.\n\nIf S, y=0 at t=2, safe.\n\nIf D, y= -1 not allowed, so y stays 0, same as S.\n\nSo at t=1, we must do S or D, but D same as S since y min 0, so effectively, we must stay at t=1, so at t=2, y=0.\n\nt=1: action, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nAt turn t, we choose a_t, which affects y_{t+1}.\n\nFor example, at turn t=1, choose a_1, then y_2 = y_1 + Δy_1\n\ny_1 = 0\n\nIf a_1 = U, y_2 = 0 +1 =1\n\nBut at t=2, on y=1, which is occupied, collision.\n\nIf a_1 = S, y_2 = 0 +0 =0, safe.\n\nIf a_1 = D, y_2 = 0 -1 = -1, but y must be in [0,9], so probably clamped to 0, or invalid? The game dynamics say y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so I think it stays at 0 if would go below.\n\nSimilarly for above 9.\n\nSo for a_1 = D, y_2 = max(0, -1) =0, same as S.\n\nSo at t=1, we must not go up; we must do S or D, resulting in y_2=0.\n\nNow at t=2, y=0, safe.\n\nNow we need to go up.\n\nBut y=1 and y=2 are only dangerous at t=2, which has passed. At t=2, we are on y=0, not on y=1 or 2.\n\nNow at t=2, we can choose to go to y=1 at t=3.\n\nt=2: choose a_2, then y_3 = y_2 + Δy_2\n\ny_2=0\n\nIf U, y_3=1\n\nIf S, y_3=0\n\nIf D, y_3=0\n\nNow, if we go to y=1 at t=3, is it safe?\n\ny=1 occupied only at t=2, not at other times. At t=3, y=1 should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 occupied only at t=2, so at other times safe.\n\nSo at t=2, we can go up to y=1 at t=3.\n\ny_3=1\n\nThen at t=3, we are on y=1, which is safe since not t=2.\n\nNow from here, we can go up to y=2 at t=4.\n\nt=3: choose a_3, then y_4 = y_3 + Δy_3\n\ny_3=1\n\nIf U, y_4=2\n\nIf S, y_4=1\n\nIf D, y_4=0\n\nNow, if we go to y=2 at t=4, is it safe?\n\ny=2 is dangerous only at t=2, not at t=4, so should be safe.\n\nBut y=3 is dangerous at t=4 and t=5.\n\nIf we go to y=2 at t=4, then we are on y=2 at t=4, safe.\n\nBut then from y=2, we might go to y=3 at t=5.\n\ny_4=2, then y_5 = y_4 + Δy_4\n\nIf we go to y=3 at t=5, but y=3 is occupied at t=5, so if on y=3 at t=5, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt t=4, if we are on y=2, and we go up to y=3 at t=5, then at t=5, on y=3, occupied, collision.\n\nWe could stay on y=2 at t=5, but y=2 is safe at t=5, since only dangerous at t=2.\n\nBut we need to go up eventually.\n\ny=3 dangerous at t=4 and t=5.\n\nSo we need to be on y=3 not at t=4 or t=5.\n\nSimilarly for y=4.\n\nNow, back to sequence.\n\nStart:\n\nt=1: y=0, must do S or D, say S, so y_2=0\n\nt=2: y=0, we can do U, so y_3=1\n\nt=3: y=1, we can do U, so y_4=2\n\nNow at t=4, y=2, which is safe.\n\nBut if we do U at t=4, y_5=3, but at t=5, on y=3, which is occupied, collision.\n\nIf we do S at t=4, y_5=2, still on y=2, safe, but not progress.\n\nThen at t=5, y=2, we can do U to y_6=3.\n\nBut at t=6, on y=3, which is safe? y=3 occupied at t=4 and t=5, not at t=6.\n\nt=6, Δt = T - t_1 = T - 1, for y=3, occupied at T=4 and T=5, so at T=6, not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 occupied at T=4 and T=5, not at T=6.\n\nSo at t=5, from y=2, if we do U, y_6=3, safe.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nBut let's see the time.\n\nt=1: y=0\n\na1=S: y2=0\n\nt=2: a2=U: y3=1\n\nt=3: a3=U: y4=2\n\nt=4: now y4=2, if we do S: a4=S, y5=2\n\nt=5: a5=U, y6=3\n\nNow at t=6, y=3, safe.\n\nThen we can go up to y=4 at t=7.\n\nt=6: a6=U, y7=4\n\nBut y=4 is dangerous at t=4 and t=5, but t=7 is fine.\n\ny7=4 at t=7, safe.\n\nThen t=7: a7=U, y8=5\n\ny=5 always safe.\n\nt=8: a8=U, y9=6\n\nt=9: a9=U, y10=7\n\nt=10: a10=U, y11=8\n\nt=11: a11=U, y12=9\n\nReached y=9 at t=12.\n\nBut is this minimal? We used 11 turns from start? Let's count.\n\nStart at t=1, y=0.\n\nAfter actions, at turn t, y_t.\n\nWe reach y=9 at t=12.\n\nBut the number of actions: from t=1 to t=11, we have actions a1 to a11, and at t=12, y=9.\n\nThe sequence is {a_t for t=t1 to t1+H-1}, and y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nt1=1, so at turn t1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nIn this case, at t=12, y=9, so t1 + H -1 =12, t1=1, so 1 + H -1 =12, H=12.\n\nH is the number of turns, I think.\n\nThe player takes H actions, from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1, and after H actions, at turn t1+H, position should be (0,9)? Let's see.\n\nThe position after actions.\n\nAt turn t, before action, position is given, then we choose action, which determines next position.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, but in the answer format, it's Turn t: a_t\n\nAnd we need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nt1 + H -1 is the turn when we have position y=9.\n\nFor example, at turn t, after action a_t, we have y_{t+1}.\n\nStandard: at turn t, we are at position y_t, then we choose a_t, which sets y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nStart: turn t1=1, y1=0.\n\nAfter action a1, y2 = y1 + Δy1\n\nThen at turn 2, y2.\n\nAfter a2, y3, and so on.\n\nWe want at some turn T, y_T =9.\n\nAnd T = t1 + H -1.\n\nSince t1=1, T= H.\n\ny_T=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=1 to t=H-1, and at turn H, y_H=9.\n\nFor example, if no moves, at t=1, y=0, not 9.\n\nIf we go up every turn: t=1, a1=U, y2=1\n\nt=2, a2=U, y3=2\n\n...\n\nAfter k up moves, at turn k+1, y= k.\n\nTo have y=9 at turn T, we need to have done 9 up moves, but since we start at t=1 y=0, after 9 up actions, at turn 10, y=9? Let's see.\n\nt=1: y1=0\n\na1=U: y2=1\n\na2=U: y3=2\n\n...\n\na9=U: y10=9\n\nSo at turn 10, y=9.\n\nWith 9 actions from t=1 to t=9, and at turn 10, y=10? No.\n\ny10=9.\n\nTurn when y=9 is turn 10.\n\nt1 + H -1 =10, t1=1, so 1 + H -1 =10, H=10.\n\nIn general, to go from y=0 to y=9, min H=10 turns, with 9 up actions, reaching at turn 10.\n\nBut in this case, we have obstacles.\n\nIn my earlier sequence, I had to wait, so H=12.\n\nBut perhaps we can do better.\n\nBack to obstacles.\n\ny=1 and y=2 only dangerous at t=2.\n\ny=3 and y=4 dangerous at t=4 and t=5.\n\nIn the direct path, if we go up every turn:\n\nt=1: a1=U, y2=1 → but at t=2, on y=1, occupied, collision. Not possible.\n\nt=1: must not go up, so do S or D, y2=0.\n\nThen t=2: y2=0, if go U, y3=1, at t=3, on y=1, safe.\n\nThen t=3: a3=U, y4=2, at t=4, on y=2, safe? y=2 dangerous only t=2, t=4 is fine.\n\nThen t=4: a4=U, y5=3, at t=5, on y=3, but y=3 occupied at t=5, collision.\n\nSo we need to avoid that.\n\nAt t=4, instead of going up, we can stay or go down.\n\nBut going down not useful.\n\nSo at t=4, on y=2, do S, so y5=2.\n\nThen t=5: on y=2, safe, then a5=U, y6=3, at t=6, on y=3, safe since not t=4 or t=5.\n\nThen continue up.\n\nBut as before, reach y=9 at t=12.\n\nCan we reach earlier?\n\nFor example, after t=3, y=1, instead of going to y=2 at t=4, we could go directly to y=3? No, can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nUnless we stay, but staying doesn't help to go faster.\n\nAnother idea: at t=2, instead of going to y=1, we stay at y=0 longer? But that would delay more.\n\nt=2: y=0, we could do S again, y3=0, then later go up, but that seems worse.\n\nSo better to go up as soon as possible except when blocked.\n\nNow, y=3 and y=4 are dangerous at t=4 and t=5.\n\nWe need to be on y=3 not at t=4 or t=5, similarly for y=4.\n\nSince y=3 and y=4 must be traversed, and we can be on them only at safe times.\n\nSafe times for y=3: all times except t=4 and t=5.\n\nSimilarly for y=4.\n\nBut since we move one step at a time, we need to enter y=3 at some turn.\n\nFor example, we can be on y=3 at t=3, but t=3: y=3.\n\nAt t=3, if we are on y=3.\n\nBut how? From t=2, if we are on y=1 or something.\n\nt=1: y=0, a1=S, y2=0\n\nt=2: a2=U, y3=1  // at t=3, y=1\n\nTo be on y=3 at t=3, we need y3=3, but from y2=0, we can only go to y3=1, not to 3. Impossible.\n\nSimilarly, earliest to be on y=3 is t=4: if y3=2, then a3=U, y4=3.\n\nBut at t=4, y=3 is dangerous.\n\nOr later, like t=6.\n\nSimilarly, to be on y=4, earliest t=5: if y4=3, a4=U, y5=4, but at t=5, y=4 dangerous.\n\nOr later.\n\nBut since y=5 to 8 safe, we can go fast there.\n\nNow, another point: we can be on y=4 without being on y=3? No, must go through sequentially, since only change by 1.\n\nSo we must go y=2 to y=3 to y=4, etc.\n\nNow, the critical part is between y=2 and y=3 to y=4.\n\nWe need to cross y=3 and y=4 when not dangerous.\n\nDangerous at t=4 and t=5.\n\nSo we should not be on y=3 at t=4 or t=5.\n\nSimilarly not on y=4 at t=4 or t=5.\n\nNow, possible to be on y=3 at t=3? Impossible as above.\n\nAt t=6 or later.\n\nSimilarly for y=4.\n\nBut if we go to y=3 at t=6, then y=4 at t=7, etc.\n\nBut we are at y=2 at some point.\n\nFrom start:\n\nt=1: a1=S, y2=0  // must\n\nt=2: a2=U, y3=1\n\nNow at t=3, y=1\n\nWe can go to y=2 at t=4: a3=U, y4=2\n\nBut y4=2 at t=4 is safe, since y=2 dangerous only t=2.\n\nThen at t=4, y=2, we need to go to y=3, but if we go at t=5, y5=3, but t=5 y=3 dangerous.\n\nIf we go at t=6: but from t=4 y=2, if we do S at t=4, y5=2, then a5=U, y6=3.\n\nThen at t=6, y=3, safe.\n\nThen a6=U, y7=4, at t=7, y=4, safe.\n\nThen a7=U, y8=5\n\na8=U, y9=6\n\na9=U, y10=7\n\na10=U, y11=8\n\na11=U, y12=9\n\nReach at t=12.\n\nAfter being on y=1 at t=3, we could stay on y=1 longer.\n\nFor example, t=3: y=1, a3=S, y4=1\n\nThen at t=4, on y=1, safe.\n\nThen t=4: a4=U, y5=2, at t=5, on y=2, safe.\n\nThen t=5: a5=U, y6=3, at t=6, on y=3, safe.\n\nThen same as before, reach y=9 at t=12 or later.\n\nWorse.\n\nFrom t=3 y=1, go up to y=2 at t=4, as before.\n\nBut at t=4 y=2, instead of staying, can we go down? But going down to y=1 at t=5, then back up, but that might take more turns.\n\nFor example, t=4: a4=D, y5=1, but y=1 safe at t=5, then t=5: a5=U, y6=2, then t=6: a6=U, y7=3, etc., even slower.\n\nSo not better.\n\nThus, minimal seems H=12, reaching at t=12.\n\nBut can we be on y=3 earlier than t=6?\n\nFor example, if we can be on y=3 at t=3, but impossible from y=0.\n\nUnless we start moving earlier, but t=1 is fixed.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=2 earlier.\n\nBut y=2 dangerous at t=2, so we cannot be on y=2 at t=2.\n\nAt t=1, we are at y=0, cannot go to y=1 at t=2 because collision.\n\nSo we must be at y=0 at t=2.\n\nThen at t=2, go to y=1 at t=3.\n\nThen at t=3, go to y=2 at t=4.\n\nThen we are stuck because we cannot go to y=3 at t=5 without collision, so we must wait at y=2 until t=5, then go to y=3 at t=6.\n\nNo choice.\n\nPerhaps we can go directly from y=1 to y=3? No, only one step.\n\nSo I think 12 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on y=3 and y=4.\n\ny=3 occupied at t=4 and t=5.\n\nt=4: T=4, t1=1, Δt=3\n\nFor y=3, third car: -29 +6*3 = -29+18= -11, -18+18=0, so span [-11,0] at T=4, so 0 in span, yes occupied.\n\nT=5: Δt=4, -29+24= -5, -18+24=6, span [-5,6], 0 in it.\n\nT=6: Δt=5, -29+30=1, -18+30=12, span [1,12], 0 not in, min=1>0.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 same.\n\nNow for y=5 to 8, no issue.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nIn the sequence, we reach y=9 at t=12.\n\nBut in terms of H: t1 + H -1 =12, t1=1, so 1 + H -1 =12, H=12.\n\nThe actions: from t=1 to t=11, 11 actions.\n\na1 to a11.\n\nIn the sequence: a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}\n\nt1=1, so actions at turn 1 to turn 1+H-1.\n\nAnd y at turn 1+H-1 is 9? No.\n\nAfter last action, at turn t, y_t is the position before action, but we need y_T=9 at some turn T.\n\nIn the game, at turn T, we are at position y_T, then we choose action a_T.\n\nAfter that, at turn T+1, we are at y_{T+1}.\n\nWe want y_T =9 for some T.\n\nIn the sequence, we specify actions for turns from t1 to t1+H-1, and after these actions, at turn t1+H, position should be such that... but the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" and \"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nLet me read.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nAlso in answer format: Turn t1: a_{t1}, Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}, ..., up to Turn t1 + H -1: a_{t1 + H -1}\n\nAnd at turn t1 + H -1, after this action, we have y_{t1 + H -1}, no.\n\nAt turn t, we perform action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nFor example, at turn t, position y_t, do a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nWe want for some T, y_T =9.\n\nT = t1 + H -1.\n\nSo at turn t1 + H -1, we have y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn terms of actions, we have actions from t=t1 to t=t1 + H -2, which set y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor instance, to have y_T=9 with T=10, we need actions from t=1 to t=9, and y_{10} = y_9 + Δy_9, but y_10=9.\n\ny_T =9 means at turn T, we are at position 9.\n\nIn the sequence, we specify actions for turns t1 to t1 + H -1, and after the last action, at turn t1 + H, we have y_{t1 + H}, but we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nPerhaps it's inconsistent.\n\nI think I need to clarify the indexing.\n\nAssume: at turn t, state is defined, including position y_t.\n\nThen we choose action a_t, which affects the next state.\n\nAfter choosing a_t, the position for the next turn is set: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, we have y_{t+1}.\n\nWe want y_T =9 for some T.\n\nT = t1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, min without obstacles: to have y_10=9, we need to go from y1=0 to y10=9, which requires 9 up actions from t=1 to t=9.\n\nActions a1 to a9, each U, then y2=1, y3=2, ..., y10=9.\n\nSo T=10, t1=1, T = t1 + H -1 => 10 = 1 + H -1 => H=10.\n\nActions at t=1 to t=9.\n\nIn general, H actions to reach in H turns from start? T = t1 + H -1.\n\nt1 + H -1 is the turn number when we are at y=9.\n\nWith H actions? From t1 to t1 + H -1, that's H actions.\n\nIn the sequence, {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so indices from t1 to t1+H-1, total H actions.\n\nAnd after these actions, at turn t1 + H, we have y_{t1 + H}, but we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn the min case, at turn t1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, the last action is at t1 + H -1, which sets y_{t1 + H}, but we need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} is the position at the beginning of turn t1 + H -1, before action a_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nThen after a_{t1 + H -1}, we get y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut we want the position to be 9 at some turn, before action.\n\nThe problem says \"reach (0,9)\" and \"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\", so it means at turn t1 + H -1, before action, we are at (0,9).\n\nIn that case, for min without obstacles, at turn 10, y=9, so t1 + H -1 =10, t1=1, H=10.\n\nActions from t=1 to t=9, which set y2 to y10.\n\nAt turn 1, y1=0, before action.\n\nAfter a1, y2 set.\n\nAt turn 10, y10=9, before action at turn 10.\n\nBut we don't need to act at turn 10 if we are already at 9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t1 to t1+H-1, but when y_{t1+H-1}=9, we may not need action at t1+H-1, but the sequence includes it? Inconsistency.\n\nPerhaps the sequence is up to the action that gets us to y=9.\n\nAssume that we stop when we reach.\n\nBut in the answer, we specify actions until we reach.\n\nFor example, to reach at turn T, we have actions from t1 to T-1.\n\nThen y_T = y_{t1} + sum of Δy from t1 to T-1.\n\nAnd T = t1 + H -1.\n\nIn min case, T=10, H=10, actions from t=1 to 9.\n\nAt turn 10, y10=9.\n\nIn our case with obstacles, we reach at turn 12, y12=9, so T=12, H=12, actions from t=1 to 11.\n\nNow, back to the sequence.\n\nWith the waiting, we have:\n\nt=1: a1=S (or D, same), so y2=0\n\nt=2: a2=U, y3=1\n\nt=3: a3=U, y4=2  // at t=4, y=2\n\nt=4: a4=S, y5=2  // stay, so at t=5, y=2\n\nt=5: a5=U, y6=3  // at t=6, y=3\n\nt=6: a6=U, y7=4  // at t=7, y=4\n\nt=7: a7=U, y8=5  // y=5 safe\n\nt=8: a8=U, y9=6\n\nt=9: a9=U, y10=7\n\nt=10: a10=U, y11=8\n\nt=11: a11=U, y12=9\n\nAt turn 12, y=9.\n\nSo actions: from t=1 to t=11.\n\nH=11? t1 + H -1 =12, t1=1, 1 + H -1 =12, H=12.\n\nNumber of actions: 11 actions (t=1 to 11), but H is the number of turns, I think H=12.\n\nThe minimal H is 12.\n\nBut can we do better?\n\nFor example, if we can be on y=4 at t=3 or something, impossible.\n\nAnother thought: since y=3 and y=4 are only dangerous at t=4 and t=5, we could be on y=3 at t=3, but cannot.\n\nOr at t=6, as above.\n\nBut t=6 is after.\n\nWe could go to y=3 before t=4.\n\nBut from start, we can only be on y=3 at earliest t=4: if a1=U, but cannot because collision at t=2.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nPerhaps use down move to delay, but down from y=0 not possible.\n\nSo I think 12 is minimal.\n\nBut let's list the safe times for each row.\n\ny=0: always safe, no cars.\n\ny=1: safe except t=2\n\ny=2: safe except t=2\n\ny=3: safe except t=4,5\n\ny=4: safe except t=4,5\n\ny=5-8: always safe\n\ny=9: safe\n\nTo go from y=0 to y=9, min 9 steps up.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on bad row at bad time.\n\nThe conflicts: at t=2, we cannot be on y=1 or y=2.\n\nAt t=4 and t=5, we cannot be on y=3 or y=4.\n\nIn the timeline:\n\nWe start at t=1, y=0.\n\nt=1: must not go to y=1, so stay y=0.\n\nAt t=2, y=0 (since we stayed).\n\nt=2: we can go to y=1 at t=3.\n\nAt t=3, y=1, safe.\n\nFrom here, we can go to y=2 at t=4.\n\nAt t=4, y=2, safe (since y=2 only bad at t=2).\n\nBut at t=4, if we go to y=3, then at t=5, y=3, which is bad.\n\nIf we stay at y=2 at t=4, then at t=5, y=2, safe.\n\nThen at t=5, we can go to y=3 at t=6.\n\nAt t=6, y=3, safe.\n\nThen go to y=4 at t=7, safe.\n\nThen up to y=9 at t=12.\n\nIf at t=3, y=1, we stay at y=1 at t=4: a3=S, y4=1.\n\nAt t=4, y=1, safe.\n\nThen at t=4, go to y=2 at t=5: a4=U, y5=2.\n\nAt t=5, y=2, safe.\n\nThen at t=5, go to y=3 at t=6: a5=U, y6=3, safe.\n\nSame as before.\n\nNo better.\n\nThus minimal H is 12.\n\nNow, for the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to output the actions from t=t1 onwards.\n\nt1=1.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 1: S (or D, but S is fine)\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: S (stay at y=2)\n\nTurn 5: U (to y=3)\n\nIn the sequence above, t=4: a4=S, so y5=2\n\nThen t=5: a5=U, y6=3\n\nThen t=6: a6=U, y7=4\n\n...\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=12.\n\nIn the action list, we have actions up to t=11.\n\nFor the answer.\n\nBut in the freeways, y=5 to 8 are safe, so we can go up continuously.\n\nIn the sequence, from t=6 to t=11, all U.\n\nt=6: a6=U to y7=4? y7=4 at t=7.\n\nt=6: at t=6, y6=3, a6=U, y7=4\n\nThen t=7: a7=U, y8=5\n\nt=8: a8=U, y9=6\n\ny9=6 at t=9\n\nt=9: a9=U, y10=7\n\nt=10: a10=U, y11=8\n\nt=11: a11=U, y12=9\n\nYes.\n\nNow, for the collision note: when we move to a new row, we are not on that row until the next turn.\n\nFor example, at t=5, we are on y=2, action U, so we move to y=3 at t=6, so at turn t=5, we are on y=2, not on y=3, so no issue with y=3 cars at t=5.\n\nSimilarly, at t=6, on y=3, but t=6 not dangerous for y=3.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo all good.\n\nNow, the action at t=4 is S, staying at y=2.\n\nWe could do D, but same, since y=2, D would go to y=1, but then we need to come back, worse.\n\nSo S is fine.\n\nNow, in the car state for y=3 and y=4, there are multiple cars, but only the third one affects, as we saw.\n\nAlso, for y=1 and y=2, only one car.\n\nNow, output the sequence.\n\nH=12.\n\nActions from t=1 to t=11.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 1: S\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: S\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\n}\n\nIn this, at t=5: U, from y=2 to y=3 at t=6.\n\nThen t=6: U to y=4 at t=7.\n\nt=7: U to y=5 at t=8.\n\n...\n\nUp to t=11: U to y=9 at t=12.\n\nYes.\n\nSince from t=7 onwards, all U, but we need to specify all.\n\nIn the sequence, t=4 is S, and t=5 is U.\n\nBut at t=5, we do U to go to y=3 at t=6.\n\nCould we do something else? No.\n\nPerhaps we can combine, but I think this is minimal.\n\nAnother path: suppose we go to y=1 later.\n\nFor example, at t=2, instead of going up, we stay at y=0.\n\nt=2: a2=S, y3=0\n\nThen t=3: a3=U, y4=1\n\nAt t=4, y=1, safe.\n\nThen t=4: a4=U, y5=2, at t=5, y=2, safe.\n\nThen t=5: a5=U, y6=3, at t=6, y=3, safe.\n\nThen same as before, but now we started later, so y6=3, then to y=9 at t=12? t=6 y=3, t=7 y=4, t=8 y=5, ..., t=12 y=9, same turn.\n\nBut we wasted a turn at t=2 staying, so we might reach later? In this case: t=1: S, y2=0\n\nt=2: S, y3=0\n\nt=3: U, y4=1\n\nt=4: U, y5=2\n\nt=5: U, y6=3\n\nt=6: U, y7=4\n\nt=7: U, y8=5\n\n...\n\nt=11: U, y12=9? Let's see:\n\nAfter a5=U at t=5, y6=3\n\na6=U, y7=4\n\na7=U, y8=5\n\na8=U, y9=6\n\na9=U, y10=7\n\na10=U, y11=8\n\na11=U, y12=9\n\nSame as before, but we have an extra S at t=2, so we need one more action? In this sequence, actions from t=1 to t=11, but we have a2=S, whereas previously a2=U.\n\nIn this, at t=1: S, y2=0\n\nt=2: S, y3=0 (extra stay)\n\nt=3: U, y4=1\n\n...\n\nThen to reach y12=9, we still have 11 actions? t=1 to t=11 actions, y12=9.\n\nBut compared to first sequence, in first sequence we had t=1:S, t=2:U, t=3:U, t=4:S, t=5:U, ..., t=11:U\n\nIn this new, t=1:S, t=2:S, t=3:U, t=4:U, t=5:U, t=6:U, ..., t=11:U\n\nBut with t=2:S, we have y3=0, then we go to y4=1, so we are one step behind, so to reach y=9, it would be later? In first sequence, at t=3, y=1; in this, at t=4, y=1, so we are one turn behind, so we reach y=9 at t=13 or something.\n\nt=1: S, y2=0\n\nt=2: S, y3=0\n\nt=3: U, y4=1\n\nt=4: U, y5=2\n\nt=5: U, y6=3\n\nt=6: U, y7=4\n\nt=7: U, y8=5\n\nt=8: U, y9=6\n\nt=9: U, y10=7\n\nt=10: U, y11=8\n\nt=11: U, y12=9\n\nSame turn t=12, but with 11 actions, same as before.\n\nBut we used an extra stay at t=2, but we reached at same time because we didn't have to wait later? In this sequence, from t=5 to t=11 all U, no stay, but we started later.\n\nAt t=6, y=3, which is after t=5, safe, and we go directly.\n\nBut in terms of reaching y=9, both at t=12.\n\nBut in the first sequence, we had a stay at t=4, here we have a stay at t=2, but same number of actions and same arrival time.\n\nBut in this sequence, at t=4, we are on y=1, not y=2, and we go to y=2 at t=5, which is safe, and to y=3 at t=6, safe.\n\nBut y=3 is safe at t=6, yes.\n\nBut we have the same H=12.\n\nIn this case, we avoided the need to stay at y=2 by staying earlier at y=0.\n\nBut arrival time same.\n\nSo both sequences work, but H same.\n\nIn this sequence, we don't have the S at t=4, but we have S at t=2.\n\nBut for min H, same.\n\nNow, in this sequence: actions: t=1:S, t=2:S, t=3:U, t=4:U, t=5:U, t=6:U, t=7:U, t=8:U, t=9:U, t=10:U, t=11:U\n\nAnd y12=9.\n\nBut we can check if at any point collision.\n\nt=2: y=0, safe\n\nt=3: y=0? At turn t=3, y3=0 (before action), then a3=U, y4=1\n\nAt turn t=3, we are on y=0, not on freeway, so no collision.\n\nThen at t=4: y4=1, before action. On y=1, which is safe at t=4? y=1 occupied only at t=2, not t=4, so safe.\n\nThen a4=U, y5=2\n\nAt t=5: y5=2, on y=2, safe at t=5.\n\na5=U, y6=3\n\nAt t=6: y6=3, on y=3, safe, as before.\n\nThen continue.\n\nSo this also works with H=12.\n\nBut in this case, we have two stays at the beginning, but same H.\n\nTo have fewer actions or earlier arrival, but we still arrive at t=12.\n\nSo min H is 12.\n\nNow for the answer, we can choose either sequence.\n\nI think the first one is fine.\n\nIn the output, it should be from t1=1.\n\nNow, in the car state, for freeway 3 and 4, there are multiple cars, but we considered only the one that matters.\n\nAlso, for y=5-8, no cars, so safe.\n\ny=9 safe.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nThus minimal H=12.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 1: S\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut H=12, and actions up to turn 11.\n\nIn the sequence, we have 11 actions, but H=12 turns.\n\nThe answer should include only necessary actions, but since we reach at turn 12, and action at turn 11 gets us to y=9 at turn 12, so we stop.\n\nIf we include action at turn 12, but not needed.\n\nIn the format, it says sequence to reach, so up to when we reach.\n\nIn this case, turn 11 action is the last one.\n\nSo for the box.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 1\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).

The current turn is t₁ = 2, and I start at y=0.\n\nFirst, understand the car movements. Cars move left or right at constant speeds. Collision happens only if at turn T, I'm on freeway y_T and 0 is within the span of a car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nAlso, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, I arrive at y+1 at turn T+1, and I only check for collision on y+1 at turn T+1.\n\nThe player position update is: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on action U (+1), D (-1), S (0). y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nNow, the car states at turn t₁=2:\n\nFor each freeway, there are cars listed with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nI need to find where these cars are at future turns relative to t₁=2.\n\nLet τ = T - t₁ = T - 2, so τ is the number of turns after the current turn.\n\nFor a car, at time T, the span is:\n\nIf left-moving: [h - s*(T-2), τ - s*(T-2)]? Wait, tail is τ, but in the notation, it's head h and tail τ.\n\nLook: for left-moving car: initial span at t₁=2 is [h, τ], and since left, it moves decreasing, so at time T, span is [h - s*(T-2), τ - s*(T-2)].\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: initial [τ, h]? Let's see the notation.\n\nIt says: for left-moving: Span(t₁) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t₁), τ - s*(T-t₁)]\n\nBut h and τ, which is head and tail? In the initial, for left, it says (-24,11,left,36), so h=-24, τ=11? But -24 to 11, that seems odd because -24 < 11, so [h,τ] with h=-24, τ=11 would be from -24 to 11, which is increasing, but it's left-moving? That doesn't make sense.\n\nI think I have a confusion in the notation.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\nIt says: for car k on freeway i, head at h, tail at τ at turn t₁.\n\nAnd for left-moving: Span(t₁) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t₁), τ - s(T-t₁)]\n\nIn the example for freeway 1: (-24,11,left,36), so h=-24, τ=11. Now, [h,τ] = [-24,11], which is from -24 to 11, and since it's left-moving, moving left means decreasing x, so at later time, both decrease.\n\nBut [-24,11] with s=36, at T=t₁, it's at x from -24 to 11.\n\nSince left-moving, as time increases, x decreases.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: it says Span(t₁) = [τ, h]? No.\n\nIt says: \"Span(t₁) = [τ, h] for right-moving? Let's see:\n\n\"Right-moving: [Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\"\n\nIn the table, for freeway 3: (60,49,right,6), so τ=60, h=49? But it says (head h, tail τ), but in the notation, it's listed as (h, τ, d, s), but for right-moving, Span(t₁) = [τ, h], which for (60,49,right,6) would be [60,49]? But 60>49, so [60,49] is empty or what? That can't be.\n\nI think there's inconsistency in the head and tail definition.\n\nLet me read the car update rules again.\n\n\"Car update rules: For car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail is at τ at turn t₁\"\n\nThen for left-moving: \"Span(t₁) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t₁), τ - s (T-t₁)]\"\n\nFor ( -24,11,left,36), h=-24, τ=11, so [h,τ] = [-24,11], and at T, [ -24 -36(T-2), 11 -36(T-2) ]\n\nSince left-moving, head is at smaller x, I assume, but here h=-24 < τ=11, so head is at left, tail at right, so moving left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: \"Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t₁), h + s (T-t₁)]\"\n\nFor (60,49,right,6), if τ=60, h=49, then [τ,h] = [60,49], which is from 60 to 49, which is decreasing, but it's right-moving, which should be increasing. Contradiction.\n\nPerhaps I have head and tail confused.\n\nIn the initial state, for left-moving, (h,τ) = (-24,11), with h=-24, τ=11, and since left-moving, head is at left, so h < τ.\n\nFor right-moving, (60,49,right,6), if it's right-moving, head should be at larger x, but 60>49, so if head is at 60, tail at 49, then [τ,h] with τ=49, h=60? But the notation says (head h, tail τ), so for right-moving, it's (h,τ) = (60,49), but Span(t₁) = [τ, h] = [49,60]? Let's see the rule.\n\nThe rule says for right-moving: Span(t₁) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t₁), h + s(T-t₁)]\n\nFor (60,49,right,6), if h=60, τ=49, then [τ,h] = [49,60], which is from 49 to 60, and at T, [49 +6(T-2), 60 +6(T-2)], so it moves right, increasing.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, (h,τ) = (-24,11), Span(t₁) = [h,τ] = [-24,11], at T, [-24 -36(T-2), 11 -36(T-2)], moves left.\n\nIn the table, it's listed as (head h, tail τ), so for left-moving, head at left (smaller x), tail at right; for right-moving, head at right (larger x), tail at left.\n\nBut in the Span, for left-moving, it's [h,τ] with h<τ, for right-moving, it's [τ,h] with τ<h? In the Span definition, for right-moving, it says [τ,h], and since τ and h, for (60,49), τ=49, h=60, so [49,60], which is fine.\n\nLet's clarify the notation in the table.\n\nThe table says: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor freeway 1: (-24, 11, left, 36) so h = -24, τ = 11, d = left, s = 36\n\nSpan at t₁=2: [h, τ] = [-24, 11]\n\nFor freeway 3: (60, 49, right, 6) so h = 60, τ = 49, d = right, s = 6\n\nSpan at t₁=2: [τ, h] = [49, 60] because for right-moving, it's [τ, h]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if y_T = k for some freeway k=1 to 8, and 0 is in the span of any car on freeway k at time T.\n\nAlso, I am at position (0, y_t) at each turn.\n\nI start at turn t=2, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn, say T, so that y_T = 9.\n\nH is the number of turns, including the starting turn? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is from t = t₁ to t = t₁ + H - 1, so at turn t₁, I take action a_{t₁}, which determines y_{t₁+1}, and so on, up to a_{t₁+H-1}, which determines y_{t₁+H}, and we want y_{t₁+H} = 9? No.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t₁ + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t₁ + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1 relative to t₁, so actions at times t₁, t₁+1, ..., t₁+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, at time t₁ + H, the position is y_{t₁+H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t₁ + H - 1} = 9.\n\nLet's see the indices.\n\nAt turn t, I am at (0, y_t), I take action a_t, then I move to y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo after taking action at turn t, I am at y_{t+1} at turn t+1.\n\nI start at turn t₁=2, y=0.\n\nI take action a_2, which determines y_3.\n\nThen at turn 3, I am at y_3, take a_3, go to y_4, and so on.\n\nI want to be at y=9 at some turn T, so y_T = 9 for T = t₁ + H - 1.\n\nFor example, if H=1, actions from t=2 to 2, so one action a_2, then at turn t=3, y_3 should be 9? But y_3 = y_2 + Δy_2, and y_2=0, so y_3 = 0,1, or -1, but y in [0,9], so y_3=1 if U, or 0 if S, or 0 if D (since y>=0, D from 0 goes to 0? y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy U:+1, D:-1, S:0, and y in [0,9], so if y_t=0, D gives y_{t+1}= max(0, -1) =0, similarly U to min(9,1)=1, etc.\n\nBut from y=0, I can only go to y=1 or stay at 0, not directly to 9 in one step.\n\ny_T =9 at turn T.\n\nTurn T = t₁ + H - 1 = 2 + H -1 = H +1.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T.\n\nFor y_T=9, T = t₁ + H -1 = H +1 since t₁=2.\n\nAlso, the actions are from time t= t₁ to t₁ + H -1, which is from 2 to (2 + H -1) = H+1? Let's set τ = t - t₁, so at τ=0, turn t=t₁=2, y=0.\n\nI take action a_{t₁ + τ} for τ=0 to H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, I have taken actions at times t=2,3,4,..., up to t=2+H-1.\n\nThen at time t=2+H, I am at y_{2+H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t₁ + H -1} = y_{2 + H -1} =9.\n\nSo at turn t = 2 + H -1, y_t =9.\n\nFor example, if I start at turn 2, y=0, after 0 actions, I am at turn 2, y=0, not 9.\n\nAfter 1 action at turn 2, I go to y_3 at turn 3.\n\nWe want y_{2+H-1} =9.\n\nFor H=1, y_{2+1-1} = y_2=0 ≠9.\n\nH=2, y_{2+2-1} = y_3=9? But from y_2=0, y_3 can be 0 or 1, not 9.\n\nH=3, y_{2+3-1} = y_4=9? Possible if I go up twice, but from 0 to 1 to 2, not 9.\n\nI think I have a off-by-one error.\n\nLet me define the turn when I am at position.\n\nAt turn t, I am at (0, y_t), and I take action a_t, then at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}.\n\nI start at turn t=2, y=0.\n\nI want to be at y=9 at some turn T.\n\nThe sequence of actions is from t=2 to some t, such that after actions, I reach y=9 at turn T.\n\nThe number of turns H is the number of actions taken.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t₁ + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} means actions at time t₁, t₁+1, ..., t₁+H-1.\n\nAfter taking these H actions, the position at time t₁ + H is y_{t₁+H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t₁ + H -1} =9.\n\nFor example, suppose I take no action, H=0, but at turn t₁=2, y=0, not 9.\n\nH=1, actions at t=2, then at t=3, y_3, which could be 1 if U, but not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9, I need at least 9 steps up from 0, so minimum H=9 actions, from y=0 to y=9 in 9 steps, each U, so at turn t=2+9=11, y_11=9.\n\nThen y_{t₁ + H -1} = y_{2+9-1} = y_10? Let's calculate.\n\nt₁ + H -1 = 2 + H -1\n\nWe want this to be the turn when y=9.\n\nAt that turn, I am at y=9 before taking action, but since I reach y=9 at that turn, and I may not take action there if it's the last turn.\n\nIn the sequence, actions are taken from t=2 to t=2+H-1, and at turn t=2+H-1, I am at y=9.\n\nFor example, to reach y=9 at turn T, I need to have taken actions from turn 2 to T-1, so that at turn T, y_T=9.\n\nThe number of actions is from t=2 to T-1, so H = (T-1) - 2 +1 = T -2.\n\nThen t₁ + H -1 = 2 + (T-2) -1 = T-1.\n\nBut we want y_{t₁ + H -1} = y_{T-1} =9, but at turn T-1, y_{T-1} is not necessarily 9, y_T=9.\n\nI'm confused.\n\nLet's read the problem:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t₁ + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\n\" such that y_{t₁ + H -1} = 9\"\n\nAnd \"the sequence of actions for t from 0 to H-1 relative to t₁, so actions at times t₁, t₁+1, ..., t₁+H-1.\"\n\nAt time t, after taking action, I am at y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t, take action a_t, then at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at the start, turn t=2, I am at y_2=0.\n\nAfter taking action a_2, at turn 3, I am at y_3.\n\nAfter taking action a_3, at turn 4, y_4, and so on.\n\nAfter taking action at turn t= t₁ + H -1, at turn (t₁ + H -1) +1 = t₁ + H, I am at y_{t₁+H}.\n\nBut we want y_{t₁ + H -1} =9, which is the position at turn t= t₁ + H -1, before taking action that turn.\n\nFor example, to have y_T =9 at turn T, I need to be at y=9 at turn T.\n\nThe actions taken to get there are at turns before T, from 2 to T-1.\n\nThe last action is at turn T-1, which sets y_T = y_{T-1} + Δy_{T-1}.\n\nIf y_{T-1} =8, and U, then y_T=9.\n\nOr if y_{T-1}=9, S, then y_T=9, but we are already at 9.\n\nBut to reach 9, we can arrive at turn T with y_T=9.\n\nThen the turn when we are at 9 is T.\n\nIn terms of H, the number of actions.\n\nActions are from turn 2 to T-1 inclusive, so number of actions H = (T-1) - 2 +1 = T -2.\n\nThen t₁ + H -1 = 2 + (T-2) -1 = T-1.\n\nAnd y_{t₁ + H -1} = y_{T-1}, which is not necessarily 9; for example, if I go from 8 to 9 at turn T, y_{T-1}=8.\n\nBut the problem says \"y_{t₁ + H -1} =9\", so it must be that at turn t= t₁ + H -1, I am at y=9, and I may take an action or not, but since it's part of the sequence, I take action at that turn.\n\nIf at turn T I am at y_T=9, and I take no further action, but in the sequence, for H, if I include the action at turn T, but if I take action at turn T, it changes y_{T+1}, but we want to be at 9 at turn T, so I should not take action at turn T if I am already at 9.\n\nBut the sequence includes actions up to when I reach 9.\n\nThe key is that y_{t₁ + H -1} =9, so at turn t= t₁ + H -1, I am at position y_t =9.\n\nAnd I take action a_t at that turn, which might keep me at 9 or move, but since I reach 9 at that turn, and for the sequence, I need to specify the action at that turn.\n\nBut to minimize H, I should reach as soon as possible, so I likely move up each time until I reach 9.\n\nFrom y=0 to y=9, minimum 9 steps up, so at turn 2, y2=0, take U, turn 3 y3=1, U, ..., at turn 11, y11=9.\n\nSo at turn 11, I am at y=9.\n\nThe turn when I am at 9 is T=11.\n\nThen the actions to get there are at turns 2 to 10, which are 9 actions.\n\nH = number of actions = 9.\n\nThen t₁ + H -1 = 2 + 9 -1 =10, and y_{10} should be 9? But at turn 10, if I took action at turn 10, y11 is set, but y10 is position at turn 10.\n\nIn this case, to have y11=9, I must have y10=8 and action U at turn 10.\n\nSo at turn 10, y10=8, not 9.\n\nThen y_{t₁ + H -1} = y_{2+9-1} =y10=8, but we want it to be 9.\n\nContradiction.\n\nIf I reach y9=9 at turn 9, but from y2=0, I can only reach y3=1, y4=2, ..., y11=9 after 9 actions.\n\nAt turn t, y_t.\n\nAt turn 2, y2=0.\n\nAfter first action at turn 2, y3 = y2 + Δy2.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn 2+k, y_{2+k} = y2 + sum of Δy from t=2 to 2+k-1.\n\nTo have y_T =9 at turn T, with T>2.\n\nThe number of actions to reach turn T is from turn 2 to T-1, so H = T-2 actions.\n\nThen at turn T, y_T=9.\n\nBut the condition is y_{t₁ + H -1} =9.\n\nt₁ + H -1 = 2 + (T-2) -1 = T-1.\n\ny_{T-1} =8 if I go up, or 9 if I stay, but I start from 0, so y_{T-1} is at most 8 if T-1=10 for T=11.\n\nBut we need y_{T-1} =9, which means I must be at 9 at turn T-1, so I reached earlier.\n\nFor example, if I reach y9=9 at turn 9, then from turn 2 to 8, I need to go from 0 to 9 in 7 steps? But each step I can increase by at most 1, so from turn 2 to turn 9, there are 7 actions (turns 2 to 8), y9 = y2 + sum Δy from 2 to 8.\n\ny2=0, y9 = sum of 7 Δy, each at most 1, so y9 <=7, cannot be 9.\n\nTurn 2 to turn 9 is 7 steps: actions at 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 determine y3 to y9.\n\ny3 to y9 are 7 positions, but y2 is given, so after 7 actions, I have y9.\n\ny2=0, after 7 actions, y9 <=7 <9, impossible to reach y=9 by turn 9.\n\nMinimum turn to reach y=9 is turn 11, with y11=9, after 9 actions from turn 2 to 10.\n\nAt turn 10, y10=8.\n\nThen y_{t₁ + H -1} with H=9, t₁+ H-1 =2+9-1=10, y10=8, not 9.\n\nBut the problem requires y_{t₁ + H-1} =9, so for H=9, it should be y10=9, but it's 8.\n\nSo to have y10=9, I need to reach earlier, but I can't.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 at turn 10.\n\nHow? From y2=0, after 8 actions (turns 2 to 9), y10 is determined.\n\ny10 = 0 + sum Δy from t=2 to 9, 8 terms, each at most 1, so y10 <=8, can be 8 if all U, but not 9.\n\ny10 <=8, so impossible to have y10=9.\n\nSimilarly, y11=9 possible with 9 actions.\n\nBut y_{t₁ + H-1} for H=9 is y10, which is at most 8.\n\nSo how can y_{t1+H-1} =9?\n\nUnless H is such that t1+H-1 is the turn when I am at 9.\n\nFor that, I need to be at y=9 at turn T, with T = t1 + H -1.\n\nFrom above, T = t1 + H -1.\n\nBut to reach y=9, T >=11 since y2=0.\n\nT >=11.\n\nThen T = 2 + H -1 = H+1.\n\nSo H+1 >=11, H>=10.\n\nWith H=10, T = H+1 =11.\n\ny11=9.\n\nThen y_{t1+H-1} = y_{2+10-1} =y11=9.\n\nYes!\n\nWith H=10, t1+H-1 =2+10-1=11, y11=9.\n\nActions from t=2 to t=2+10-1=11, so actions at turn 2 to 11.\n\nAction at turn 11 determines y12, but at turn 11, I am at y11=9, and I take action a11, which sets y12.\n\nBut we don't care about y12, as long as at turn 11, I am at 9.\n\nIn the sequence, I take actions from turn 2 to turn 11, 10 actions.\n\nAt turn 11, I am at y11=9, and I take some action, say S, to stay, or U to go to 10, but y=10 is invalid, so I must do S or D, but since I want to reach and stop, probably S.\n\nBut the position at turn t=11 is (0,9), which is what we want.\n\nSimilarly, for minimum, with all U, I can reach in 9 steps to y11=9, but with 9 actions, from turn 2 to 10, at turn 11 y11=9, but y_{t1+H-1} with H=9 is y_{2+9-1}=y10, which is 8, not 9.\n\nWith H=10, I can have y11=9.\n\nBut with H=10, I can reach earlier? No, because from y2=0, to y11=9, it takes 9 steps up, so I must have at least 9 up actions, and possibly one stay or down, but that would take more turns, so minimum H is 10 to have y11=9 with actions including a11=S at turn 11.\n\nI could reach y11=9 with actions from 2 to 10: 9 actions, but then for the sequence, to have y_{t1+H-1}=9, I need H such that t1+H-1=11, so 2+H-1=11, H=10.\n\nThen the actions include a11 at turn 11, which can be S to stay at 9.\n\nSo effectively, I take 9 U actions from turn 2 to 10, then at turn 11 a11=S.\n\nBut that takes 10 turns to be at 9.\n\nI could have reached at turn 11 with 9 actions, but the output requires to include the action when I am at 9.\n\nSo for the purpose of this problem, H=10 is the minimum to satisfy the condition.\n\nSimilarly, in general, to reach y=9 from y=0, it takes at least 9 up moves, so at turn 11, I am at 9 with 9 actions from 2 to 10.\n\nTo have y_T=9 at turn T, with T=11, and H such that t1+H-1=T, so 2+H-1=11, H=10.\n\nSo I must have H=10 actions: 9 U and one S at the end, or something.\n\nBut I can have fewer if I move faster, but I can only move +1 per turn, so no, minimum 9 up actions.\n\nSo H=10 is minimum for the sequence to include the arrival turn.\n\nIn this case, with cars, I may need to wait or go down, so H may be larger, but minimum without cars is 10.\n\nBut with cars, it might take more.\n\nFor now, back to the car avoidance.\n\nFirst, let's list the cars and their positions over time.\n\nt1=2, τ = T - 2, so at time T, τ = T-2.\n\nFor each freeway, I need to know when 0 is occupied, so that I cannot be on that freeway at that turn.\n\nCollision if at turn T, I am on freeway k, and 0 is in the span of a car on k at T.\n\nI start at y=0 at turn 2, but y=0 is not a freeway, freeways are y=1 to 8, so at y=0 or y=9, no cars, so no collision possible. I can be at y=0 or y=9 safely.\n\nThe problem says \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\", so when I am on y=1 to 8, I need to avoid collision.\n\nAt y=0 or 9, no issue.\n\nNow, for each freeway, find for which turns T, 0 is in some car's span on that freeway.\n\nThen, when I am on that freeway at that turn, collision.\n\nSince I move one step at a time, I can plan the path.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-24,11,left,36) so at t1=2, span [h,τ] = [-24,11]\n\nAt time T, span [ -24 -36(T-2), 11 -36(T-2) ]\n\n0 is in span if -24 -36(τ) <= 0 <= 11 -36(τ) where τ=T-2.\n\nSince the car is long, from -24 to 11, length 35, speed 36, so it moves fast.\n\nFind τ such that min( -24-36τ, 11-36τ) <= 0 <= max( -24-36τ, 11-36τ)\n\nSince left-moving, and h<τ, so the left end is decreasing faster? -24-36τ, right end 11-36τ.\n\nSince the span is [left, right] with left <= right, and both decreasing.\n\n0 in [left, right] if left <= 0 <= right.\n\nSo -24 -36τ <= 0 and 0 <= 11 -36τ\n\nFirst inequality: -24 -36τ <= 0 => -36τ <= 24 => τ >= -24/36 = -2/3, but τ=T-2 >=0 since T>=2, so always true for T>=2.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 11 -36τ => 36τ <=11 => τ <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305\n\nSince τ integer, τ <= 0, so τ=0.\n\nτ = T-2, so for T=2, τ=0, 0 <= 11 -0 =11, true.\n\nFor T=3, τ=1, 0 <=11-36= -25? 0 <= -25 false, so not.\n\nSimilarly for T>2, not.\n\nSo only at T=2, 0 is in the span for freeway 1.\n\nAt T=2, span [-24,11], 0 is between -24 and 11, yes.\n\nAt T=3, span [-24-36,11-36] = [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly later.\n\nSo freeway 1 has car at x=0 only at turn T=2.\n\nBut at turn T=2, I am at y=0, not on freeway 1, so no collision possible. I am on freeway only when y_t from 1 to 8.\n\nAt turn T=2, I am at y=0, so not on any freeway.\n\nFor freeway 1, only at T=2, 0 is occupied, but at that time, I am not on y=1, so no issue.\n\nFor other T, no car at x=0, so freeway 1 is always safe except at T=2, but since I am not on it, it's fine.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, (-24,11,left,36), so identical, only at T=2, 0 occupied, but I am not on it, so safe.\n\nNow freeway 3: cars: (60,49,right,6), (24,13,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nFirst, for each car, find when 0 is in span.\n\nFirst car: (60,49,right,6), head h=60, tail τ=49, direction right, so span at t1=2: [τ,h] = [49,60]\n\nAt time T, span [49 +6(T-2), 60 +6(T-2)]\n\n0 in span if 49 +6τ <= 0 <= 60 +6τ, but 49+6τ >=49>0 for τ>=0, so 0 <= 49+6τ is true, but 0 >= 60+6τ? 0 >=60+6τ false since 60+6τ>0, so 0 < left end, never in span. So this car never at x=0.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (24,13,right,6), h=24, τ=13, span at t1=2: [13,24]\n\nAt T, [13+6τ, 24+6τ]\n\n0 in [13+6τ,24+6τ]? 13+6τ >=13>0, so left end >0, 0 not in.\n\nThird car: (-12,-23,right,6), h=-12, τ=-23, span at t1=2: [τ,h] = [-23,-12]\n\nAt T, [-23 +6τ, -12 +6τ]\n\n0 in span if -23+6τ <= 0 <= -12+6τ\n\nFirst, 0 <= -12+6τ => 6τ >=12 => τ >=2\n\nSecond, -23+6τ <= 0 => 6τ <=23 => τ <= 23/6 ≈3.833, so τ <=3\n\nThus τ=2 or 3.\n\nτ=2: T-2=2, T=4, span [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], 0 is included? [left,right], left=-11, right=0, so 0 <= right, and left <=0, so yes, 0 in [-11,0].\n\nSimilarly τ=3: T=5, span [-23+18, -12+18] = [-5,6], 0 in [-5,6].\n\nτ=4: T=6, span [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 3, third car at x=0 at T=4 and T=5.\n\nAt T=4, span [-11,0], x=0 is the right end, included.\n\nAt T=5, span [-5,6], 0 inside.\n\nNow, other cars on freeway 3: first and second never at 0, so only third car causes issue at T=4 and T=5.\n\nSo freeway 3 occupied at x=0 at turns T=4 and T=5.\n\nFreeway 4: same cars as freeway 3: (60,49,right,6), (24,13,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nSo identical to freeway 3, occupied at T=4 and T=5.\n\nNow freeway 5: only one car (60,49,right,6), as before, never at x=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6: (60,49,right,6), never at 0.\n\nFreeway 7: (60,49,right,6), never at 0.\n\nFreeway 8: (60,49,right,6), never at 0.\n\nNow, are there other cars? Freeway 5 to 8 only have one car each, all (60,49,right,6), which never at 0.\n\nBut for freeway 3 and 4, we have the third car that is at 0 at T=4,5.\n\nAlso freeway 1 and 2 only at T=2, but not occupied when I might be there.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nStart at turn 2, y=0.\n\nI can move up, down, or stay.\n\nBut to go up, I need to avoid being on a freeway when it is occupied at x=0.\n\nThe occupied times:\n\nFor each freeway, when it is dangerous to be there.\n\nFreeway 1: dangerous only at T=2, but at T=2 I am at y=0, not on it.\n\nFreeway 2: same, dangerous only at T=2, not an issue.\n\nFreeway 3: dangerous at T=4 and T=5 (occupied at x=0)\n\nFreeway 4: dangerous at T=4 and T=5\n\nFreeway 5 to 8: never dangerous, since no car at x=0 ever.\n\nSo only freeway 3 and 4 are problematic at turns 4 and 5.\n\nI need to not be on freeway 3 or 4 at turns 4 and 5.\n\nThat is, at turn T=4, I should not be at y=3 or y=4.\n\nSimilarly at turn T=5, not at y=3 or y=4.\n\nNow, at other times, all freeways are safe.\n\nI start at turn 2, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimum path is to go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on y=3 or 4 at turns 4 and 5.\n\nTurns: let's list the turns from 2 onwards.\n\nAt turn 2: position y=0 (safe)\n\nAction a2: can be U or S (D to 0, same as S)\n\nIf U, go to y=1 at turn 3.\n\nIf S, stay at y=0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI need to be at y=9 by some turn.\n\nSince freeways 5-8 are always safe, and 1-2 only dangerous at T=2 which I avoid, 3-4 dangerous at T=4,5.\n\nI can go directly up, but need to skip y=3 and 4 at turns 4 and 5.\n\nAt turn 4, if I am not on y=3 or 4, safe.\n\nSimilarly turn 5.\n\nPossible to be on other y or not on freeway.\n\ny=0 or 9 are safe.\n\nNow, let's plan the sequence.\n\nI start at turn 2, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimum time: if no cars, I can go up each turn: turn 2: U, to y=3? Let's see:\n\nTurn 2: y=0, take a2, go to y_{3}\n\nAfter action at turn t, position at turn t+1.\n\nTurn t: position y_t, take action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nAt turn 2: y=0, take a2, then y3 = 0 + Δy2\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTo have y11=9, as before.\n\nBut with cars, I need to avoid being on y=3 or 4 at turn 4 and turn 5.\n\nThat is, at turn 4, y4 should not be 3 or 4.\n\nAt turn 5, y5 not 3 or 4.\n\nNow, turns: let's list the position at each turn.\n\nTurn 2: y2=0\n\nTurn 3: y3 = y2 + Δy2\n\nTurn 4: y4 = y3 + Δy3\n\nTurn 5: y5 = y4 + Δy4\n\nTurn 6: y6 = y5 + Δy5\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI need y4 ≠ 3 and y4 ≠ 4\n\ny5 ≠ 3 and y5 ≠ 4\n\nAlso, to minimize H, I want to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nEarliest possible: if I go up every turn, y3=1, y4=2, y5=3, y6=4, y7=5, y8=6, y9=7, y10=8, y11=9.\n\nAt turn 4, y4=2, which is not 3 or 4, so safe.\n\nAt turn 5, y5=3, which is 3, and at turn 5, freeway 3 is occupied, so if I am at y=3 at turn 5, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nIn this path, at turn 5, y5=3, and freeway 3 occupied at x=0, so collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 4, y4=2, which is freeway 2, but freeway 2 is safe at turn 4, since only dangerous at T=2.\n\nFreeway 2: only at T=2 occupied, at T=4 not occupied, so safe.\n\nBut at turn 5, y5=3, freeway 3 occupied, collision.\n\nSo I need to avoid that.\n\nPossible ways:\n\n1. At turn 5, be not at y=3 or 4.\n\nSince y5=3 in the min path, I need to be different.\n\nFor example, at some point, go slower or faster.\n\nStart at turn 2, y=0.\n\nOption: take U at turn 2, go to y=1 at turn 3.\n\nThen at turn 3, y=1.\n\nIf U, go to y=2 at turn 4.\n\ny4=2.\n\nThen at turn 4, y=2, which is freeway 2, safe (not occupied).\n\nThen action at turn 4: if U, go to y=3 at turn 5.\n\nBut at turn 5, y5=3, which is dangerous.\n\nIf at turn 4, I take S, stay at y=2, then at turn 5, y5=2.\n\nThen at turn 5, y=2, freeway 2, which is safe (no car at x=0).\n\nThen I can proceed up.\n\nBut at turn 5, y5=2, not 3 or 4, safe.\n\nThen later go up.\n\nBut I am delayed.\n\nFrom turn 2: U, to y3=1\n\nTurn 3: S, stay? y3=1, take S, then y4=1\n\nThen at turn 4, y4=1, freeway 1, safe.\n\nThen action at turn 4: U, to y5=2 at turn 5.\n\ny5=2, freeway 2, safe.\n\nThen continue up.\n\nBut slower.\n\nTo avoid y=3 at turn 5, I can be at y=2 or y=1 or y=0 or y=5+, etc. at turn 5.\n\nBut y=0 or 1 might be too low.\n\nSince freeways 5-8 are always safe, I can go faster to higher y.\n\nBut I start from low.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 4, if I am at y=4, but at turn 4, freeway 4 is occupied, so if y4=4, collision.\n\nIn the min path, y4=2, not 4.\n\nBut y5=3 problem.\n\nI can go up faster? No, only +1 per turn.\n\nUnless I start later, but I have to start from turn 2.\n\nTurn 2: instead of U, stay at y=0.\n\nBut that delays.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nSo to avoid y=3 at turn 5, in the sequence, I need that at turn 5, y5 ≠3.\n\nSimilarly, y4 can be 2, as before.\n\nIn the min path, y5=3, which is bad.\n\nSo I can, for example, at turn 3, instead of U to y=2, take S or D, but D to y=1 or S to y=1, but y3=1, if S, y4=1, then U to y5=2.\n\nThen y5=2, safe.\n\nBut now at turn 5, y=2, whereas in min path it was 3, so I am behind.\n\nThen from there, I need to go to 9, so it takes longer.\n\nSimilarly, I can be at higher y at turn 5.\n\nFor example, from turn 2: U to y3=1\n\nTurn 3: U to y4=2 (if I go up, but y4=2)\n\nThen at turn 4, instead of U, I can take U to go to y5=3, but dangerous, or take S to y5=2, or D to y5=1.\n\nThen y5=2 or 1.\n\nThen from there, I need to catch up.\n\nBut since I have to reach y=9, and I am slower, it takes more turns.\n\nAnother possibility: since freeways 3 and 4 are dangerous only at turns 4 and 5, I can be on them at other times.\n\nFor example, at turn 3, I can be on y=3 or 4, but at turn 3, freeway 3 and 4 are safe, since only dangerous at T=4,5.\n\nAt turn 3, T=3, for freeway 3, at T=3, is there car?\n\nEarlier for freeway 3, car at x=0 only at T=4 and 5.\n\nAt T=3, τ=1, for third car, span [-23+6(1), -12+6(1)] = [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nOther cars not at 0, so freeway 3 safe at T=3.\n\nSimilarly freeway 4 same.\n\nAt turn 6, T=6, τ=4, span for third car [ -23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSo freeway 3 and 4 are safe except at T=4 and T=5.\n\nTherefore, I can be on y=3 or 4 at other turns.\n\nTo minimize time, I should go up as fast as possible except avoid being on y=3 or 4 at turns 4 and 5.\n\nThat means, at turn 4, I should not be on y=3 or 4, so y4 ≠3 and y4 ≠4.\n\nSimilarly at turn 5, y5 ≠3 and y5 ≠4.\n\nNow, y4 depends on previous actions.\n\nStart: turn 2, y=0.\n\nAfter a2, y3 = 0 + Δy2\n\nAfter a3, y4 = y3 + Δy3\n\nAfter a4, y5 = y4 + Δy4\n\nI need y4 not 3 or 4, and y5 not 3 or 4.\n\nAlso, to reach y=9 fast.\n\ny4 must be between 0 and 9.\n\nSimilarly y5.\n\nPossible values for y4: since from y2=0, after two actions (a2 and a3), y4 can be from 0 to 2? y3 = Δy2 (since y2=0), so y3=0 or 1.\n\nThen y4 = y3 + Δy3, so if y3=0, y4=0,1; if y3=1, y4=0,1,2.\n\nSo y4 can be 0,1,2.\n\nSimilarly, y5 = y4 + Δy4, can be from y4-1 to y4+1, but y4 <=2, so y5 <=3.\n\nNow, y4 cannot be 3 or 4, but since max y4=2, it cannot be 3 or 4 anyway. y4 <=2, so y4=0,1,2, all not 3 or 4, so the constraint y4 ≠3,4 is automatically satisfied.\n\nSimilarly, y5: since y4 <=2, y5 = y4 + Δy4 <= 2 +1 =3, or min 2-1=1 if y4=2 and D, but y5 <=3.\n\nNow y5 cannot be 3 or 4, so y5 must not be 3.\n\nSince y5 <=3, y5 cannot be 4 anyway, so the only constraint is y5 ≠3.\n\nBecause if y5=3, and at turn 5, on freeway 3, occupied, collision.\n\nSo I need y5 ≠3.\n\ny5 can be 0,1,2,3, but must not be 3.\n\nSo y5 <=2.\n\nSince y4 <=2, and y5 = y4 + Δy4, to have y5 <=2, I need that if y4=2, then I cannot take U, must take S or D, so y5=2 or 1.\n\nIf y4=1, y5=0,1,2\n\nIf y4=0, y5=0,1\n\nIn all cases, I can choose Δy4 to make y5 <=2.\n\nBut to minimize time, I want to be as high as possible.\n\nNow, let's list the turns.\n\nTurn 2: y=0, take action a2\n\nGo to y3 = Δy2, which is 0 or 1.\n\nIf I take U, y3=1, better.\n\nAssume take U, so a2=U, y3=1\n\nTurn 3: y=1, take action a3\n\nThen y4 = y3 + Δy3 = 1 + Δy3, so y4=0,1,2\n\nSince I want to go up, probably take U, so y4=2\n\nThen turn 4: y=2, take action a4\n\nThen y5 = y4 + Δy4 = 2 + Δy4\n\nNow y5 must not be 3, so if I take U, y5=3, which is bad.\n\nSo I must not take U at turn 4 if y4=2.\n\nInstead, take S or D.\n\nIf take S, y5=2\n\nIf take D, y5=1\n\nThen at turn 5, y=2 or 1.\n\nThen from there, I need to go up to 9.\n\nBut at turn 5, y5=2 or 1, whereas in min path it was 3, so I am behind by one or two.\n\nThen to reach y=9, I need more turns.\n\nFor example, after y5=2, I can go up each turn.\n\nTurn 5: y=2, take U, to y6=3\n\nBut at turn 6, T=6, freeway 3 is safe, so ok.\n\nThen y7=4, y8=5, y9=6, y10=7, y11=8, y12=9.\n\nSo at turn 12, y12=9.\n\nCompared to min 11, it takes one extra turn.\n\nIf at turn 4 I take D, y5=1, then even worse.\n\nTo be higher at turn 5.\n\nBut from turn 2, with two actions, I can be at y4=2 max, then at turn 4, if I take S, y5=2, or if I could be higher, but I cannot, since only +1 per turn.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 3, instead of going to y4=2, I could stay or go down, but that makes y4 lower, not better.\n\nFor example, at turn 3, y=1, take S, then y4=1\n\nThen turn 4, take U, y5=2\n\nSame as before, y5=2.\n\nThen same as above.\n\nOr turn 3, take D, y4=0, then turn 4 U, y5=1, worse.\n\nSo best I can do is y5=2.\n\nThen from turn 5 y=2, go up: a5=U, y6=3\n\na6=U, y7=4\n\na7=U, y8=5\n\na8=U, y9=6\n\na9=U, y10=7\n\na10=U, y11=8\n\na11=U, y12=9\n\nSo at turn 12, y12=9.\n\nBut I need to be at y=9 at turn t with t = t1 + H -1 = 2 + H -1 = H+1\n\nSet y_t =9 at turn t.\n\nHere t=12.\n\nThen H such that t = H+1, so 12=H+1, H=11.\n\nActions from turn 2 to 2+H-1 = 2+11-1=12? t1 + H -1 =12.\n\nActions at t=2 to t1+H-1=12.\n\nNumber of actions H=11.\n\nSequence: a2 to a12.\n\nAt turn 12, y12=9, and I take action a12, which can be S to stay.\n\nBut in the sequence above, I have a11=U to go from y11=8 to y12=9.\n\nThen at turn 12, y12=9, take a12=S, say.\n\nBut to reach y12=9, actions from 2 to 11.\n\na2 to a11: 10 actions? Turns: actions at t=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11: that's 10 actions, to set y3 to y12.\n\ny3 from a2, y4 from a3, ..., y12 from a11.\n\nWith y12=9.\n\nThen for the sequence, to have y_{t1+H-1}=9, here t1+H-1=12, so y12=9.\n\nH such that t1+H-1=12, 2+H-1=12, H=11.\n\nThen actions from t=2 to 2+11-1=12.\n\nSo actions at turn 2 to 12, 11 actions.\n\nBut at turn 12, I am already at y12=9, and I take action a12, which sets y13, but we don't care.\n\nIn the action sequence, a12 can be S.\n\nBut in terms of reaching, with the above, I used 10 actions to reach y12=9 at turn 12, but with H=11, I have an extra action at turn 12.\n\nBut since I need H=11 to satisfy the index, it's fine.\n\nBut I can reach faster if I don't have the delay.\n\nIn the min path without cars, I reach at turn 11 with 9 actions.\n\nBut with cars, I have to delay because of the conflict at turn 5.\n\nBut can I avoid the conflict without delaying?\n\nFor example, at turn 4, instead of being at y=2, can I be at y=4 or something? No, impossible.\n\nAnother idea: since at turn 4 and 5, I need to not be on y=3 or 4, but I can be on y=5 or higher, but at turn 4, from start, y4 max 2, so I cannot be higher than 2 at turn 4.\n\nSimilarly at turn 5, y5 max 3 if I go up, but I cannot have y5=3.\n\nSo I must have y5 <=2.\n\nTherefore, at turn 5, I am at most y=2.\n\nThen from there, to go to y=9, I need at least 7 more up moves, so reach y=9 at turn 12.\n\nTurn 5 y=2, turn 6 y=3, turn 7 y=4, ..., turn 12 y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nIf I could be at y=3 at turn 6, but turn 6 is safe.\n\nBut at turn 5 I am low.\n\nPerhaps I can go down briefly to avoid, but that seems worse.\n\nAnother thought: at turn 5, if I am at y=5, but I cannot, since y4 max 2, y5 max 3.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo I think the minimal is to reach at turn 12.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can be on y=3 or 4 at other times.\n\nFor example, at turn 3, if I can be at y=3.\n\nHow? From turn 2, y=0, take U, to y3=1.\n\nThen at turn 3, take U, to y4=2? Cannot reach y=3 at turn 3.\n\ny3 is after one action, max 1.\n\nSo impossible to be on y=3 or 4 before turn 4 or after turn 5 with less delay.\n\nTherefore, the path I have is fine.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I have a choice at turn 4.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 2: U, to y3=1\n\nTurn 3: U, to y4=2\n\nTurn 4: now, to avoid y5=3, I must not take U. So take S or D.\n\nIf take S, y5=2\n\nThen turn 5: U, to y6=3\n\nTurn 6: U, to y7=4\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 11: U, to y12=9? Let's list positions.\n\nTurn t | y_t | action a_t | next y\n\nStart: turn 2, y=0\n\na2: U → y3=1\n\nTurn 3, y=1, a3: U → y4=2\n\nTurn 4, y=2, a4: S (for example) → y5=2\n\nTurn 5, y=2, a5: U → y6=3\n\nTurn 6, y=3, a6: U → y7=4\n\nTurn 7, y=4, a7: U → y8=5\n\nTurn 8, y=5, a8: U → y9=6\n\nTurn 9, y=6, a9: U → y10=7\n\nTurn 10, y=7, a10: U → y11=8\n\nTurn 11, y=8, a11: U → y12=9\n\nNow, at turn 12, y=9.\n\nBut we need to be at y=9 at some turn, here turn 12.\n\nFor the sequence, with H=11 actions? From turn 2 to turn 11, that's 10 actions: a2 to a11.\n\nTurns 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11: 10 actions.\n\ny12=9 at turn 12.\n\nTo have y_{t1+H-1} =9, set t1+H-1=12, 2+H-1=12, H=11.\n\nThen actions from t=2 to t1+H-1=12.\n\nSo a2 to a12.\n\nNow at turn 12, y12=9, I need to take action a12.\n\na12 can be S, to stay at y=9.\n\nThen y13=9, but we don't care.\n\nIn the sequence above, I have actions up to a11, which sets y12=9.\n\nThen a12=S at turn 12.\n\nBut in the position, at turn 12, I am at y12=9 before taking a12.\n\nAfter taking a12, y13=9.\n\nBut for collision, at turn 12, I am on y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, in this path, I used a4=S at turn 4.\n\nI could have taken D at turn 4.\n\nBut S is better, since I stay at y=2.\n\nD would go to y=1, then need to come back, worse.\n\nAt turn 3, I could take S instead of U, but then y4=1, then turn 4 U to y5=2, same as before, but at turn 4 I was lower.\n\nIn the above, with a3=U, y4=2.\n\nIf a3=S, y4=1, then a4=U, y5=2, same y5=2, but y4=1 <2, so at turn 4 I am lower, but since no issue, it might be fine, but in terms of reaching, I reach y=9 later? In this case, turn 5 y=2 same, so same as above.\n\nBut with a3=S, y4=1, then from there, same.\n\nBut to minimize, better to be higher earlier.\n\nIn the first way, with a3=U, y4=2, better.\n\nNow, back to the car: at turn 6, y6=3, but turn 6 T=6, freeway 3 safe, no car at x=0.\n\nSimilarly turn 7 y7=4, T=7, freeway 4 safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, H=11 actions: a2 to a12.\n\nBut a2 to a12 is 11 actions: t=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12.\n\nYes.\n\nSequence: a2=U, a3=U, a4=S, a5=U, a6=U, a7=U, a8=U, a9=U, a10=U, a11=U, a12=S\n\na12=S to stay.\n\nBut at turn 12, I am at y12=9, and I take S.\n\nNow, for freeway 4, at turn 5, I am at y=2, not 4, so safe.\n\nIn the sequence, I have to output for turns starting from t1=2.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t1: a_{t1}, etc.\n\nNow, but I need to confirm if there is a faster way.\n\nSuppose at turn 4, I take D instead of S, but then y5=1, then I need more steps to go up, so y12=9 still, but at turn 12, but I was lower at turn 5, but since I go up from there, same arrival time.\n\nBut with y5=1, turn 5: U to y6=2, then U to y7=3, ..., up to y12=7? Turn 5 y=1, a5=U y6=2, a6=U y7=3, ..., a11=U y12=8, then need another U to y13=9, later.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo better to stay at y=2 at turn 4 with S.\n\nAt turn 3, if I take U to y4=2, then at turn 4 S to y5=2.\n\nCan I be on y=4 at turn 4? No.\n\nAnother idea: since freeways 5-8 are safe, if I can reach higher y faster, but I start from low, no.\n\nPerhaps I can go down to y=0 and stay, but that delays more.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nBut with no cars, min is H=10 to reach at turn 11 with 9 actions and one S, but with cars, I have to take 11 actions to reach at turn 12.\n\nIn no cars, with H=10, I can reach at turn 11: actions a2 to a11 with all U except a11=S? Let's see.\n\nWith no cars: turn 2: U to y3=1\n\na3:U y4=2\n\na4:U y5=3\n\na5:U y6=4\n\na6:U y7=5\n\na7:U y8=6\n\na8:U y9=7\n\na9:U y10=8\n\na10:U y11=9\n\nThen at turn 11, y11=9.\n\nActions from a2 to a10, 9 actions? a2 to a10: 9 actions, set y3 to y11.\n\ny11=9 at turn 11.\n\nThen for sequence, to have y_{t1+H-1}=11, so 2+H-1=11, H=10.\n\nActions a2 to a10, and at turn 11, y11=9, but no action at turn 11 in this sequence? With H=10, actions from t=2 to t1+H-1=2+10-1=11.\n\nSo a2 to a11.\n\nThen a11 can be S at turn 11.\n\nBut in the min path, with a2 to a10 all U, y11=9, then a11=S.\n\nBut with cars, at turn 5, y5=3, which is bad.\n\nSo I cannot do that.\n\nHence, with the delay, I reach at turn 12.\n\nBut in my earlier path, I reach at turn 12.\n\nNow, for freeway 4, at turn 4, if I were on y=4, collision, but I am on y=2, safe.\n\nAt turn 5, y=2, safe.\n\nNow, another thing: in the car list, for freeway 3 and 4, multiple cars, but I think I covered.\n\nFreeway 5 to 8 no issue.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I have a4=S.\n\nI could go to y=3 at a later time.\n\nBut I think it's fine.\n\nNow, to write the sequence.\n\nH=11, since y12=9 at turn 12, t1+H-1=12, 2+H-1=12, H=11.\n\nActions from turn 2 to 12.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: S  (to stay at y=2 for turn 5)\n\nTurn 5: U  (to y=3 at turn 6)\n\nBut at turn 5, I take U, so y6=3.\n\nPosition at turn t.\n\nAfter action.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nTurn 2: a2=U → y3=1\n\nTurn 3: a3=U → y4=2\n\nTurn 4: a4=S → y5=2\n\nTurn 5: a5=U → y6=3\n\nTurn 6: a6=U → y7=4\n\nTurn 7: a7=U → y8=5\n\nTurn 8: a8=U → y9=6\n\nTurn 9: a9=U → y10=7\n\nTurn 10: a10=U → y11=8\n\nTurn 11: a11=U → y12=9\n\nNow, for H=11, I need action at turn 12.\n\nTurn 12: a12=S → y13=9, but we don't care.\n\nIn the output, it should be up to turn 12.\n\nBut at turn 12, I am at y=9.\n\nNow, in the sequence, a11=U to go to y12=9, then a12=S.\n\nBut I can set a11=S if y11=9, but here y11=8.\n\nIn this sequence, y11=8, so I need a11=U to go to 9.\n\nThen a12=S.\n\nTo minimize actions, but H is fixed by the arrival turn.\n\nSince I have to take action at turn 12, I do a12=S.\n\nNow, but in the answer, I need to output the actions.\n\nNow, but let's confirm the collision points.\n\nAt turn 4: I am at y4=2, freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2: at T=4, is it occupied? Earlier, freeway 2 only occupied at T=2, at T=4 not, so safe.\n\nAt turn 5: y5=2, freeway 2, not occupied, safe.\n\nAt turn 6: y6=3, freeway 3, T=6, not occupied, safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nCould I have taken a4=D? Then y5=1, then a5=U to y6=2, then a6=U to y7=3, etc., then y12=9 still, but at turn 12, but I was lower at turn 6, but same arrival.\n\nBut worse because I go down and up, unnecessary.\n\nSo better to take S at turn 4.\n\nNow, about freeway 4: at turn 5, I am not on it, but freeway 4 is dangerous only at T=4 and 5, and at T=5 I am on y=2, not 4.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nNow, another thing: in freeway 3, there are multiple cars, but I think only the third one matters, and I covered.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 4.\n\nNow, I think this is the minimal H.\n\nBut is there a way with H=10?\n\nWith H=10, t1+H-1=2+10-1=11, so y11=9.\n\nBut to have y11=9, I need to go from y2=0 to y11=9 in 9 steps, so all actions U except possibly the last.\n\nBut at some point, I need to be at y=3 or 4, but at turn 5, if y5=3, collision.\n\ny5 must not be 3.\n\nNow, with all U: y3=1, y4=2, y5=3, y6=4, ..., y11=9.\n\ny5=3, which is bad.\n\nIf I skip y=3 at turn 5, but I have to be at y=3 at some turn, say turn 6.\n\nBut at turn 6, T=6, safe.\n\nBut to have y5 not 3, I need to alter the actions.\n\nFor example, turn 2: U to y3=1\n\nTurn 3: instead of U, take S, so y4=1\n\nThen turn 4: U to y5=2\n\nThen turn 5: U to y6=3\n\nTurn 6: U to y7=4\n\n...\n\nTurn 10: U to y11=8? Let's compute:\n\ny3=1\n\ny4=1 (after a3=S)\n\ny5=2 (after a4=U)\n\ny6=3 (a5=U)\n\ny7=4 (a6=U)\n\ny8=5 (a7=U)\n\ny9=6 (a8=U)\n\ny10=7 (a9=U)\n\ny11=8 (a10=U)\n\ny11=8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y11=9, I need y11=9.\n\nFrom above, with y10=7, if a10=U, y11=8.\n\nI need to be at y10=8 to go to y11=9.\n\nBut in this path, y10=7, so y11=8.\n\nThen I need another action to go to y12=9.\n\nBut with H=10, I can only have up to turn 11 action, but y11=8, not 9.\n\nIf I go faster: but I can't.\n\nTurn 2: U y3=1\n\nTurn 3: U y4=2\n\nThen at turn 4, if I take U, y5=3, bad, but I have to avoid.\n\nIf I take S at turn 4, y5=2, then y6=3, y7=4, y8=5, y9=6, y10=7, y11=8, y11=8 not 9.\n\nSame.\n\nTo reach y11=9, I must have y10=8 and a10=U.\n\nBut y10=8 requires that I was at y9=7 or 8 or 9, but from start, with all U, y10=8 at turn 10.\n\nBut in that case, y5=3 at turn 5, which is bad.\n\nIf I want y10=8 without y5=3, but from the sequence, if I go up but slower at the beginning, I am lower at turn 10.\n\nFor example, with delay, y10=7 as above.\n\nCannot reach y11=9 with H=10 under the constraint.\n\nThus minimal H is 11.\n\nSo sequence:\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: S  (to avoid going to y=3 at turn 5)\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: S\n\nIn the sequence, from turn 6 to 11, all U to go up.\n\ny from turn 6 to 12: y6=3,7,8,9,10,11,12 with values 3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nIn actions: a5=U to y6=3, a6=U to y7=4, ..., a11=U to y12=9.\n\nThen a12=S.\n\nNow, to write in the answer.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 4, it has the same cars, so same as freeway 3.\n\nBut in my path, I am not on y=4 at turn 4 or 5.\n\nAt turn 4, I am on y=2, turn 5 y=2.\n\nAll good.\n\nI think this is the plan.\n\nSo minimal H=11.\n\nSequence of actions:\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nTurn 12: S\n\nBut for turn 12, a12=S.\n\nIn the output, it should be from turn t1=2 to turn 12.\n\nNow, the answer format.\n\nAlso, in the box.\n\nBut let's write it.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 11. This sequence ensures that the player is not on freeway 3 or 4 at turns 4 and 5, when cars occupy \\(x = 0\\) on those freeways.\n\n- At turn 4, freeway 3 and 4 are occupied at \\(x = 0\\), so the player must not be on \\(y = 3\\) or \\(y = 4\\).\n- At turn 5, freeway 3 and 4 are occupied at \\(x = 0\\), so the player must not be on \\(y = 3\\) or \\(y = 4\\).\n\nThe sequence starts at turn 2 with \\(y = 0\\). By taking actions to move up (U) as much as possible but staying at \\(y = 2\\) at turn 4 (using S) to avoid reaching \\(y = 3\\) at turn 5, the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 12. The action at turn 12 (S) maintains the position at \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n- Turn 2: U (moves to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 3)\n- Turn 3: U (moves to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 4)\n- Turn 4: S (stays at \\(y = 2\\) for turn 5, avoiding collision on freeway 3 or 4 at turn 5)\n- Turn 5: U (moves to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 6)\n- Turn 6: U (moves to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 7)\n- Turn 7: U (moves to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 8)\n- Turn 8: U (moves to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 9)\n- Turn 9: U (moves to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 10)\n- Turn 10: U (moves to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 11)\n- Turn 11: U (moves to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 12)\n- Turn 12: S (stays at \\(y = 9\\))\n\nThis sequence achieves \\(y = 9\\) at turn 12 with \\(H = 11\\) turns. No shorter sequence is possible due to the need to avoid collisions at turns 4 and 5, which requires a delay in progression.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 2: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ S} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,2) at turn t1=4 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically: U for up (y+1), D for down (y-1), S for stay (y same). y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each car, I have its position at turn t1=4, and I need to know where it will be at future turns to avoid collisions. Collision happens if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn T. The span changes over time based on speed and direction.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so you only care about the car on your current freeway at each turn.\n\nAlso, for the car movement: left-moving cars have head h and tail τ, with h > τ I assume, since it's moving left, so the span decreases. Similarly for right-moving, head and tail, with head > tail for right-moving? Let me check the notation.\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ], but if it's moving left, and h is head, τ tail, probably h < τ? No, let's see the update.\n\nIt says: left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, the positions decrease, so if at t1 it's [h, τ], with h and τ, but typically for a car, head and tail, if moving left, head is on the left, so h should be larger than τ? But in the span [h, τ], if h > τ, it would be decreasing, but [h, τ] might imply h < τ if we think of it as an interval.\n\nI think there's ambiguity in how the span is defined. Let me read carefully.\n\nIt says: \"head is at h, tail is at τ\" and for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and then Span(T) = [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nFor left-moving, Span(t1) is given as [h, τ], and for right-moving, it's [τ, h]. That seems inconsistent.\n\nIn the car state table, for example, freeway 1: (48, 83, left, 36). But 48 and 83, 48 < 83, so if span is [48, 83], and moving left, so at t1, it's from 48 to 83, but moving left means decreasing x, so head should be at larger x? I think I need to interpret the coordinates.\n\nProbably, x=0 is the point we care about for collision. The car spans are given with their positions at t1.\n\nFor collision, we care if 0 is in the span at time T.\n\nFor a left-moving car, as time increases, the span shifts left, so both h and τ decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, both increase.\n\nIn the span notation, for left-moving, [h, τ] might have h and τ such that h < τ or h > τ? In the example, freeway 1: (48, 83, left, 36), 48 < 83, so [48, 83] is from 48 to 83, and moving left, so at time T, it's [48 - sΔT, 83 - sΔT].\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, like freeway 3: (-42, -53, right, 6), but it says (head, tail, dir, speed), and for right-moving, span is given as [τ, h], so in this case, head h = -42, tail τ = -53? But -42 > -53, so τ = -53, h = -42, so span [τ, h] = [-53, -42] at t1? Let's see the table.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 3: \"(-42, -53, right, 6), (36, 25, right, 6), (0, -11, right, 6)\"\n\nFor the first car: head h = -42, tail τ = -53, direction right, speed 6.\n\nFor right-moving, span is [τ, h] at t1, so [ -53, -42 ]? But -53 to -42, that's from left to right, since -53 < -42? No, -53 is less than -42, so if x increases to the right, -53 is left, -42 is right, so [ -53, -42 ] with τ = -53, h = -42.\n\nBut in the notation, it says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, head is on the right, tail on left, so τ should be left end, h right end.\n\nIn the span for right-moving, it's given as [τ, h], so if τ < h, it's [τ, h], which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, span is [h, τ], but if head is left end, tail right end, so for left-moving, head h should be less than τ if x increases right.\n\nIn freeway 1: (48, 83, left, 36), 48 and 83, 48 < 83, so if [h, τ] = [48,83], and moving left, so head at 48, tail at 83? But moving left, head should be at higher x? I think there's confusion.\n\nLet's assume x-axis increases to the right.\n\nFor a car moving left: it has head at the left end, tail at the right end. So at t1, head position is h, tail position is τ, with h < τ, since head is left. Then span [h, τ], and as time goes, both decrease: [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT].\n\nFor car moving right: head at right end, tail at left end. So at t1, head h, tail τ, with τ < h, span [τ, h], and increases: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT].\n\nIn the given data:\n\nFreeway 1: (48, 83, left, 36) — so for left-moving, head h=48, tail τ=83, so span [48,83] at t1. Since moving left, positions decrease.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 same.\n\nFor freeway 3: cars like (-42, -53, right, 6) — right-moving, so head h=-42, tail τ=-53. Since τ = -53, h = -42, so τ < h, span [τ, h] = [-53, -42] at t1. Moving right, positions increase.\n\nSimilarly, (36, 25, right, 6) — head 36, tail 25, so τ=25, h=36, τ < h, span [25,36] at t1.\n\nAnd (0, -11, right, 6) — head 0, tail -11, τ=-11, h=0, span [-11,0] at t1.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nNow, the player is at (0,2) at t1=4, and we need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is the top, and cars are on y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), so once at y=9, we can stop.\n\nNow, to minimize H, the number of turns, from y=2 to y=9, the minimum moves are 7 up actions, but we might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so it could take more turns.\n\nBut since we can stay or move down, H could be more than 7.\n\nNow, I need to simulate for each freeway, when cars will have 0 in their span, so that if the player is on that freeway at that turn, collision occurs.\n\nLet t be the turn number, with t1=4.\n\nFor a future turn T, ΔT = T - t1 = T - 4.\n\nFor each freeway and each car, I need when 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nThen, for the player to be on freeway y at turn T, it must be that no car on freeway y has 0 in span at T.\n\nThe player position: at turn T, y_T, and we need to choose actions for t from 4 to 4+H-1, to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nLet me denote the turns: start at turn 4, position y=2.\n\nAfter each action, we move to next turn.\n\nAt turn T, we are at position y_T, and we choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn T based on y_T and the cars on freeway y_T at that turn.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find the times when it is occupied, meaning that for that y, at turn T, there is a car such that 0 is in its span.\n\nThen, the player must not be on y at those times when it is occupied.\n\nSince multiple cars per freeway, I need for each y, the set of T where at least one car has 0 in span.\n\nFirst, let's list all freeways and their cars.\n\nFreeways y=1 to 8.\n\ny=1: one car: left-moving, h=48, τ=83, s=36, at t1=4.\n\nSpan at T: [48 - 36*(T-4), 83 - 36*(T-4)]\n\n0 in span when 48 - 36ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 83 - 36ΔT, where ΔT = T-4\n\nSimilarly, y=2: same as y=1, one car: (48,83,left,36), so same as above.\n\ny=3: three cars:\n\nCar A: (-42,-53,right,6) → span at T: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-53 + 6ΔT, -42 + 6ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -53 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -42 + 6ΔT\n\nCar B: (36,25,right,6) → head 36, tail 25, so for right-moving, span [τ,h] = [25,36] at t1? No.\n\nCar B: (36,25,right,6), head h=36, tail τ=25, so τ=25, h=36, span [τ,h] = [25,36] at t1.\n\nAt T: [25 + 6ΔT, 36 + 6ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 25 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 36 + 6ΔT\n\nBut 25 + 6ΔT > 0 for ΔT ≥ 0, since min at ΔT=0 is 25>0, so 0 is never ≤ 36+6ΔT, but the inequality is lower ≤ 0 ≤ upper, so 0 ≤ upper is always true if upper >=0, but lower <=0 <= upper.\n\nHere lower = 25+6ΔT >0 for all ΔT≥0, so 0 < lower, so 0 not in [lower, upper] since lower >0. So never occupied by this car.\n\nSimilarly, car C: (0,-11,right,6) → head 0, tail -11, τ=-11, h=0, span [τ,h] = [-11,0] at t1.\n\nAt T: [-11 + 6ΔT, 0 + 6ΔT] = [-11 + 6ΔT, 6ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -11 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 6ΔT\n\nSince 0 ≤ 6ΔT is true for ΔT ≥ 0, and -11 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 when 6ΔT ≤ 11, ΔT ≤ 11/6 ≈ 1.833, so for ΔT = 0,1 since ΔT integer.\n\nΔT = T-4, integer.\n\nSo for car C on y=3: 0 in span when -11 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 6ΔT, but 0 ≤ 6ΔT always for ΔT≥0, and -11 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 when 6ΔT ≤ 11, ΔT ≤ 11/6 ≈1.833, so ΔT=0,1\n\nAt ΔT=0 (T=4), span [-11,0], 0 is included? -11 ≤ 0 ≤ 0, yes 0 is the upper bound.\n\nSimilarly, ΔT=1 (T=5), span [-11+6, 6] = [-5,6], 0 in it.\n\nΔT=2 (T=6), span [-11+12,12] = [1,12], 1>0, 0 not in [1,12].\n\nSo only for ΔT=0 and 1, i.e., T=4 and T=5.\n\nNow car A: (-42,-53,right,6), span at T: [-53 + 6ΔT, -42 + 6ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -53 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -42 + 6ΔT\n\nLeft: -53 + 6ΔT ≤ 0 → 6ΔT ≤ 53 → ΔT ≤ 53/6 ≈ 8.833\n\nRight: 0 ≤ -42 + 6ΔT → 42 ≤ 6ΔT → ΔT ≥ 42/6 = 7\n\nSo both: ΔT ≥7 and ΔT ≤8.833, so ΔT=7,8\n\nT=4+7=11, T=4+8=12\n\nCar B we saw never, since lower bound always positive.\n\nSo for y=3, occupied when:\n\n- From car C: T=4,5\n\n- From car A: T=11,12\n\nSo overall for y=3, occupied at T=4,5,11,12\n\nT=4 and 5 from car C, T=11 and 12 from car A.\n\nNow y=4: same cars as y=3?

Similarly, for y=2, car only at T=6.\n\ny=2 has car only at T=6, so at T=4, it is free.\n\nPlayer at (0,2) at T=4, and y=2 is not occupied at T=4, so no collision now.\n\nWe need to choose action at T=4: U, D, or S.\n\nIf we go up, to y=3 at T=5.\n\nIf down, to y=1 at T=5.\n\nIf stay, y=2 at T=5.\n\nNow, let's see the occupied times for each y.\n\nSummarize occupation:\n\ny=1: occupied only at T=6\n\ny=2: occupied only at T=6\n\ny=3: occupied at T=4,5,11,12\n\ny=4: occupied at T=4,5,11,12\n\ny=5: occupied at T=11,12\n\ny=6: occupied at T=11,12\n\ny=7: occupied at T=11,12\n\ny=8: occupied at T=11,12\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nNow, at T=4, player at y=2, which is safe at T=4.\n\nWe want to reach y=9 asap.\n\nFrom y=2, if we go up immediately, at T=4 action U, so at T=5, y=3.\n\nBut y=3 is occupied at T=5? Yes, from above, y=3 occupied at T=4 and T=5.\n\nAt T=5, if player is on y=3, it will collide.\n\nAt T=4, player is on y=2, not on y=3 yet.\n\nAfter action at T=4, at turn T=5, player is at new position.\n\nAt turn T=4: position y=2, choose action a_4.\n\nIf a_4 = U, then y_5 = 3.\n\nThen at turn T=5, position y=3, and we check collision on y=3 at T=5.\n\nSince y=3 occupied at T=5, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if a_4 = S, y_5 =2, then at T=5, y=2, which is not occupied at T=5 (only at T=6), so safe.\n\nIf a_4 = D, y_5 =1, then at T=5, y=1, not occupied at T=5 (only T=6), safe.\n\nSo at T=4, we cannot go up to y=3 because at T=5 we would be on y=3 which is occupied.\n\nWe can stay or go down.\n\nBut going down might not be efficient.\n\nWe could stay at y=2 for a while.\n\ny=2 is only occupied at T=6, so at T=5, y=2 is safe, but at T=6, if we are on y=2, collision.\n\nSo we need to not be on y=2 at T=6.\n\nSimilarly for y=1.\n\nNow, let's think about the path.\n\nWe need to go from y=2 to y=9.\n\ny=3 and y=4 are occupied at early times T=4,5 and late T=11,12.\n\nBut since we start at T=4, and T=4,5 are occupied for y=3,4, we cannot be there at those times.\n\ny=5 to 8 are only occupied at T=11,12, which might be later.\n\nBut we want to reach quickly, so probably before T=11.\n\nT=11 is 7 turns after t1=4, since ΔT=7.\n\nt1=4, T=11 is turn 11.\n\nNow, from y=2 to y=9, minimum 7 moves, so if we go up every turn, we could be at y=9 at T=4+7=11? Let's see.\n\nStart T=4, y=2.\n\nAfter 1st action (T=4), to y=3 at T=5\n\nBut y=3 occupied at T=5, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf we start by staying or going down.\n\nFor example, at T=4, we can do S or D.\n\nSuppose we do S at T=4, then at T=5, y=2.\n\nT=5, y=2 is safe, since not occupied.\n\nThen at T=5, we need to choose action.\n\nIf we go up, to y=3 at T=6.\n\nBut y=3 at T=6: is it occupied? y=3 occupied at T=4,5,11,12, not at T=6, so should be safe.\n\nAt T=6, y=3 not occupied, yes.\n\nThen from there, we can go up.\n\nBut at T=6, y=2 is occupied, but we are not on y=2.\n\nLet's sequence.\n\nOption: at T=4, since we cannot go up immediately, we can stay or go down.\n\nGoing down might delay, so let's stay.\n\nT=4: action S, then y_5 =2 at T=5.\n\nT=5: position y=2, safe. Now, we can go up: action U, then y_6=3 at T=6.\n\nAt T=6, y=3 is not occupied (only at T=4,5,11,12), so safe.\n\nThen at T=6, we are at y=3, and we can go up to y=4.\n\nNow, at T=6, y=4: is it occupied? y=4 occupied at T=4,5,11,12, not at T=6, so safe to be there.\n\nAction at T=6: U, to y=4 at T=7.\n\nT=7: position y=4, now check y=4 at T=7: not occupied, safe.\n\nThen go up to y=5 at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 at T=8: y=5 occupied only at T=11,12, so at T=8 safe.\n\nGo up to y=6 at T=9.\n\ny=6 at T=9: occupied only at T=11,12, safe.\n\nGo up to y=7 at T=10.\n\ny=7 at T=10: safe.\n\nGo up to y=8 at T=11.\n\nNow, at T=11, y=8.\n\nBut y=8 is occupied at T=11? Yes, from above, y=5 to 8 occupied at T=11,12.\n\nSpecifically, y=8 occupied at T=11, so if at T=11, player is on y=8, collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nAt T=11, if we are on y=8, and y=8 is occupied, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=9 earlier.\n\nIn this sequence, we are at y=8 at T=11.\n\nBut we can go to y=9 at T=11 if we move up, but let's see the turn.\n\nAt T=10, position y=7.\n\nAction at T=10: if U, then y_11=8 at T=11.\n\nBut at T=11, y=8 occupied, collision.\n\nIf at T=10 we do something else.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe always.\n\nFrom y=7 at T=10, if we go up to y=8 at T=11, but y=8 occupied at T=11.\n\nIf we stay at y=7, then at T=11, y=7, which is also occupied at T=11 (y=5-8 all occupied T=11,12), so collision too.\n\nIf we go down, but that delays.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=5-8 at T=11 and T=12.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 and y=4 at T=11,12 also occupied, but we are past that.\n\nIn the sequence above, we are moving up slowly.\n\nFrom T=4: S, to y=2 at T=5\n\nT=5: U, to y=3 at T=6\n\nT=6: U, to y=4 at T=7\n\nT=7: U, to y=5 at T=8\n\nT=8: U, to y=6 at T=9\n\nT=9: U, to y=7 at T=10\n\nT=10: now at y=7, need to go to y=8 or something.\n\nIf U, to y=8 at T=11, but T=11 y=8 occupied.\n\nIf S, to y=7 at T=11, occupied.\n\nIf D, to y=6 at T=11, occupied.\n\nAll bad because T=11 y=5-8 occupied.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 before T=11 or after T=12, but after T=12 might be late.\n\nT=11 is 7 turns after start? t1=4, T=11 is turn 11, ΔT=7.\n\nMinimum moves: from y=2 to y=9, 7 steps, so earliest possible arrival at y=9 is at turn T=4+7=11, if we go up every turn from start.\n\nBut we couldn't go up at T=4 because of y=3 at T=5.\n\nIn the sequence we have, we started moving at T=5, so we are at y=7 at T=10, then to y=8 at T=11, but stuck.\n\nWe could go faster or slower.\n\nAnother idea: go down to y=1 or y=0 to wait.\n\nFor example, at T=4, instead of stay, go down to y=1.\n\ny=1 is safe at T=5? y=1 occupied only at T=6.\n\nAt T=4: action D, then y_5=1 at T=5.\n\nT=5: position y=1, not occupied (only T=6), safe.\n\nThen at T=5, we can stay or go down to y=0 or up to y=2.\n\nBut we need to avoid y=1 at T=6.\n\nAt T=5, if we go up to y=2, then at T=6, y=2, which is occupied at T=6, collision.\n\nIf we go down to y=0 at T=6, then at T=6, y=0, safe.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nBut y=0 to y=9 takes 9 moves, longer.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nAt T=5, at y=1, we can stay: action S, then at T=6, y=1, but occupied at T=6, collision.\n\nSo at T=5, at y=1, we must move: either U to y=2 or D to y=0.\n\nBut U to y=2 at T=6: y=2 occupied, collision.\n\nD to y=0 at T=6: safe.\n\nSo only choice is to go to y=0 at T=6.\n\nThen from y=0 at T=6, we can start going up.\n\nBut it will take more turns.\n\nFor example, T=6: at y=0, action U to y=1 at T=7.\n\nNow at T=7, y=1: is it occupied? y=1 only occupied at T=6, not before or after, so at T=7 safe.\n\nThen U to y=2 at T=8, safe.\n\nU to y=3 at T=9.\n\ny=3 at T=9: occupied only at T=4,5,11,12, not at T=9, safe.\n\nSimilarly, U to y=4 at T=10, safe.\n\nU to y=5 at T=11, but y=5 occupied at T=11, collision if we go to y=5 at T=11.\n\nAt T=10, y=4, if U to y=5 at T=11, occupied.\n\nIf at T=10, we stay at y=4, then at T=11, y=4 occupied (since y=4 occupied at T=11), collision.\n\nIf go down, worse.\n\nSo stuck again at T=11.\n\nWe need to be not on y=5-8 at T=11 and T=12.\n\nSimilarly for y=3,4 at T=11,12 but we can be before or after.\n\nSince T=11 and 12 are problematic, we can either reach y=9 before T=11 or after T=12.\n\nReaching before T=11: earliest possible is turn 11, as min 7 moves from y=2.\n\nBut to reach at turn 11, we need to be at y=9 at turn 11.\n\nThat means, at turn 10, we are at y=8 or y=9? To be at y=9 at turn T, we need to arrive there at some turn.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nIf at turn T, y_T =9, we are done.\n\nTo have y_T=9, at turn T-1, we were at y_{T-1} and action U if y_{T-1}=8, or S if y_{T-1}=9, etc.\n\nBut since we start from y=2, we need to increase y.\n\nTo reach y=9 at turn 11, we need to be at y=8 at turn 10, and action U at turn 10 to y=9 at turn 11.\n\nOr at turn 10 y=9 with S, but we are not there yet.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=8 at turn 10, we need to be at y=7 or 8 or 9 at turn 9, etc.\n\nNow, turn 11 is when y=5-8 are occupied.\n\nSo if we are at y=8 at turn 10, and go to y=9 at turn 11, at turn 11 we are at y=9, which is safe, no cars.\n\nBut at turn 10, when we are at y=8, is y=8 occupied at turn 10? y=8 occupied only at T=11,12, not at T=10, so at turn 10, y=8 is safe.\n\nThen at turn 10, action U, to y=9 at turn 11, and at turn 11, y=9 safe.\n\nSimilarly, we need to be at y=8 at turn 10.\n\nFrom start, we need to go from y=2 at turn 4 to y=8 at turn 10.\n\nThat takes 6 moves up, in 6 turns? From turn 4 to turn 10 is 6 actions: actions at turn 4,5,6,7,8,9 to reach position at turn 10.\n\nLet's list the turns:\n\nTurn 4: position y=2\n\nAfter action at turn 4, position at turn 5\n\n...\n\nAfter action at turn 9, position at turn 10.\n\nTo be at y=8 at turn 10, we need to have moved up 6 times from y=2, in some of these 6 actions (turns 4 to 9).\n\nThe number of actions from turn 4 to 9 is 6 actions, but we start at y=2, to reach y=8, we need net +6 in y, so we must have 6 up moves and no down or stay, because if we stay or down, we need more moves.\n\nSince we need to go from 2 to 8, delta y=+6, so we need exactly 6 up moves, and no down moves, and stays would require more turns, but we have exactly 6 actions to go from turn 4 to turn 10 position.\n\nStart: after 0 actions, at turn 4, y=2.\n\nAfter 1 action (turn 4), at turn 5\n\nAfter 2 actions (turn 5), at turn 6\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at turn 4+k.\n\nAfter 6 actions (turns 4 to 9), at turn 10.\n\ny at turn 10 = y_10 = initial y_4 + sum of Δy from actions at t=4 to t=9.\n\nΔy = +1 for U, -1 for D, 0 for S.\n\ny_10 = y_4 + sum_{t=4 to 9} Δy_t\n\ny_4 = 2\n\nWe want y_10 = 8\n\nSo 2 + sum Δy = 8, so sum Δy from t=4 to 9 must be +6.\n\nSince each Δy <=1, and we have 6 actions, sum Δy = +6 only if all actions are U, no S or D.\n\nThus, to be at y=8 at turn 10, we must have all actions from turn 4 to 9 being U.\n\nBut at turn 4, if we do U, we go to y=3 at turn 5, which is occupied at turn 5, collision.\n\nSo impossible to have all U from turn 4 to 9.\n\nTherefore, we cannot reach y=8 at turn 10 with only up moves because of the early occupation.\n\nWe need to have some waiting or slower movement.\n\nPerhaps reach y=9 after turn 12.\n\nFor example, after T=12, y=5-8 are free again.\n\nBut later.\n\nFirst, let's see if we can reach earlier.\n\nAnother idea: since y=3 and y=4 are free after T=5 until T=11.\n\nT=6 to T=10 are free for y=3 and y=4.\n\ny=5-8 free until T=11.\n\nSo from T=6 to T=10, all y=3 to 8 are free, except that at T=6, y=1 and y=2 are occupied, but we are not there.\n\nWe can move up during T=6 to T=10.\n\nBut we need to be at y=2 or something at T=6.\n\nStart at T=4, y=2.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=2 at T=6, since occupied.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 at T=6 occupied.\n\nAt T=4, we can go down to y=1 or stay or up, but up not possible.\n\nSuppose at T=4, we do S: to y=2 at T=5.\n\nAt T=5, y=2 safe.\n\nThen at T=5, we need to not be on y=2 at T=6, so we must move: either U or D.\n\nIf U to y=3 at T=6.\n\nAt T=6, y=3 is safe, as not occupied.\n\nThen from T=6, we can go up to y=4 at T=7, safe.\n\ny=5 at T=8, safe.\n\ny=6 at T=9, safe.\n\ny=7 at T=10, safe.\n\nNow at T=10, y=7, safe.\n\nThen we want to go to y=8 and y=9.\n\nBut at T=11, if we go to y=8, occupied.\n\nSo at T=10, we can go to y=8 at T=11, but T=11 occupied.\n\nOr stay at y=7 at T=11, occupied.\n\nOr go down, not good.\n\nSo we need to delay the move to y=8 until after T=12.\n\nFor example, at T=10, at y=7, we can stay for one or two turns, but at T=11 and T=12, y=7 is occupied, so we cannot stay on y=7 during T=11 and T=12.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot be on y=5-8 at T=11 and T=12.\n\nSo at T=10, we are at y=7, which is safe at T=10.\n\nBut at T=11, if we are on y=7,8, or 5,6, all occupied.\n\nThe only safe y at T=11 are y=0,1,2,3,4,9.\n\nBut y=3 and y=4 are occupied at T=11? From above, y=3 and y=4 occupied at T=11,12 as well.\n\ny=3: occupied T=4,5,11,12\n\ny=4: same\n\ny=1 and y=2: occupied only at T=6, so at T=11 safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nSo at T=11, safe y are: y=0,1,2,9\n\ny=3 and y=4 occupied, y=5-8 occupied.\n\nSo only y=0,1,2,9 are safe at T=11.\n\nSimilarly at T=12, same thing.\n\nAt T=10, we are at y=7, which is not safe for the next turns.\n\nWe need to move to a safe y by T=11.\n\nFrom y=7 at T=10, we can go down to y=6, but at T=11 y=6 occupied.\n\nOr to y=8, occupied.\n\nOr stay, occupied.\n\nOr go down multiple steps, but we have only one action.\n\nFrom y=7 at T=10, action D, to y=6 at T=11, occupied.\n\nAction U, to y=8 at T=11, occupied.\n\nAction S, to y=7 at T=11, occupied.\n\nAll lead to collision at T=11.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at y=7 at T=10; we need to be at a lower y or higher earlier.\n\nPerhaps we should not reach y=7 so early.\n\nOr go to y=9 before T=11.\n\nBut to reach y=9 before T=11, we need to be at y=9 at turn 10 or earlier.\n\nTurn 10: to be at y=9 at turn 10, we need to be at y=8 at turn 9, etc.\n\nFrom turn 4 to turn 10, 6 actions, to go from y=2 to y=9, delta y=+7, so sum Δy =+7 with 6 actions, impossible since each Δy <=1, max y_10 = 2+6=8, cannot reach y=9 at turn 10.\n\ny_10 <= y_4 + 6 = 2+6=8, so at turn 10, maximum y is 8, with all U.\n\nCannot be at y=9 at turn 10.\n\nEarliest to be at y=9 is turn 11, with y_10=8 and action U at turn 10 to y_11=9.\n\nAt turn 11, y=9 safe.\n\nBut to have y_10=8, with all U from turn 4 to 9, but as before, at turn 4 U leads to collision at turn 5.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nTherefore, we must reach y=9 after turn 12.\n\nFor example, at turn 12 or later.\n\nBut at turn 12, y=5-8 occupied, so we need to be at y=9 at turn 12 or later.\n\nTurn 12: to be at y=9 at turn 12, we can have y_11=8 or 9, and action.\n\nBut at turn 12, if we are on y=9, safe, but if we are on y=8, occupied.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn 12, we need to arrive there at turn 12.\n\nAt turn 11, we can be at y=8 or y=9.\n\nIf at turn 11, y=9, then action S or U to stay, but at turn 11, y=9 is safe.\n\nIf at turn 11, y=8, and action U to y=9 at turn 12.\n\nBut at turn 11, if we are on y=8, it is occupied, collision.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 12, if on y=8, occupied.\n\nSo to be at y=9 at turn 12, we must be at y=9 at turn 11 or at turn 12 with action from y=8 at turn 11, but y=8 at turn 11 occupied, so impossible to be on y=8 at turn 11.\n\nTherefore, the only way to be at y=9 at turn 12 is to be at y=9 at turn 11 and stay, or at turn 11 y=9 and action S to turn 12 y=9.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=9 at turn 11, we need to be at y=8 at turn 10 and action U at turn 10 to y=11=9.\n\nBut at turn 10, y=8 is safe, as not occupied.\n\nThen at turn 10, action U to y=9 at turn 11, safe.\n\nThen at turn 11, y=9, safe.\n\nThen we can stay or whatever, but we reached at turn 11.\n\nBut to have y=8 at turn 10, we need to get there without being on occupied lanes at wrong times.\n\nNow, from start, to be at y=8 at turn 10.\n\ny at turn 10: from y=2 at turn 4, after 6 actions (turns 4 to 9), y_10 = 2 + sum_{t=4 to 9} Δy_t\n\nWant y_10 = 8, so sum Δy = +6, so all 6 actions must be U.\n\nBut at turn 4, if we do U, we go to y=3 at turn 5, occupied, collision.\n\nSo still not possible.\n\nIf we have some stays or down, then sum Δy <6, y_10 <8, not 8.\n\nFor example, if we have one stay, y_10 <=7, not 8.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=8 at turn 10.\n\nThus, we cannot reach y=9 at turn 11.\n\nSimilarly, for later turns.\n\nSo we must reach after turn 12.\n\nLet's aim for turn 13 or later.\n\nAt turn 12, y=5-8 occupied, so we cannot be on them.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn 13, for example.\n\nThen at turn 13, y=9 safe.\n\nWe can be at y=8 at turn 12 or turn 13, but at turn 12, y=8 occupied, so we cannot be on y=8 at turn 12.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn 13, we must be at y=9 at turn 12 or at y=8 at turn 12 with action U, but y=8 at turn 12 occupied, collision.\n\nSo impossible to be on y=8 at turn 12.\n\nTherefore, to be at y=9 at turn 13, we must be at y=9 at turn 12, and action S to turn 13.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=9 at turn 12, we need to be at y=8 at turn 11 with action U at turn 11 to y=12=9.\n\nBut at turn 11, y=8 occupied, so cannot be on y=8 at turn 11.\n\nThus, the earliest we can be at y=9 is after the occupation period.\n\nSince y=5-8 are occupied at T=11 and 12, we can be at y=9 at T=11 or T=12 or later, but to be at y=9, it's safe.\n\nBut to arrive at y=9, we need to come from y=8 at some turn before.\n\nBut at T=11 and 12, y=8 is occupied, so we cannot be on y=8 at those turns.\n\nSo we must be on y=8 at a turn when it is not occupied, and then go up.\n\nY=8 is only occupied at T=11 and 12, so at T=10, it is safe, as we saw.\n\nAt T=13, it should be safe, since after T=12.\n\nLet's check the occupation for y=8.\n\ny=8 has car at T=11 and 12 only, so at T=10, safe; at T=13, safe.\n\nSimilarly for other.\n\nSo we can be on y=8 at T=10 or at T=13, etc.\n\nThen from there go up to y=9.\n\nSimilarly, to reach y=8.\n\nNow, from start, we can go up to y=8 by T=10, but as before, we can't with all up because of early issue.\n\nOr later, at T=13.\n\nBut let's first handle the early part.\n\nAt T=4, y=2.\n\nWe need to avoid y=2 at T=6.\n\nAlso, we can go down to y=1 or y=0.\n\nBut let's find a sequence that avoids the occupied times.\n\nList the safe times for each y.\n\ny=1: safe except T=6\n\ny=2: safe except T=6\n\ny=3: safe except T=4,5,11,12\n\ny=4: safe except T=4,5,11,12\n\ny=5: safe except T=11,12\n\ny=6: safe except T=11,12\n\ny=7: safe except T=11,12\n\ny=8: safe except T=11,12\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nPlayer at T=4, y=2, which is safe at T=4.\n\nTo avoid being on y=2 at T=6, we must leave y=2 by T=5 action.\n\nSimilarly for y=1 at T=6.\n\nAt T=4, actions:\n\n- If U, to y=3 at T=5, but y=3 occupied at T=5, collision.\n\n- If S, to y=2 at T=5\n\n- If D, to y=1 at T=5\n\nS and D are safe for T=5.\n\nThen at T=5, position:\n\nIf S at T=4, then y_5=2\n\nIf D at T=4, then y_5=1\n\nAt T=5, we need to choose action.\n\nFirst, suppose we did S at T=4, so at T=5, y=2.\n\nThen at T=5, we must not be on y=2 at T=6, so action must be U or D.\n\nIf U, to y=3 at T=6.\n\ny=3 at T=6 is safe, as not occupied.\n\nIf D, to y=1 at T=6, but y=1 occupied at T=6, collision, so cannot do D.\n\nSo only U: to y=3 at T=6.\n\nSimilarly, if we did D at T=4, to y=1 at T=5.\n\nAt T=5, y=1, must not be on y=1 at T=6, so action U or D.\n\nIf U to y=2 at T=6, y=2 occupied, collision.\n\nIf D to y=0 at T=6, safe.\n\nSo we have two possible paths so far:\n\nPath A: T=4 S, T=5 U, to y=3 at T=6\n\nPath B: T=4 D, T=5 D, to y=0 at T=6\n\nPath B is slower, so let's take path A for faster.\n\nSo T=4 S, T=5 U, to y=3 at T=6.\n\nNow at T=6, y=3, safe.\n\nWe can start going up.\n\nT=6 action U, to y=4 at T=7\n\nT=7 U to y=5 at T=8\n\nT=8 U to y=6 at T=9\n\nT=9 U to y=7 at T=10\n\nNow at T=10, y=7, safe.\n\nWe need to go to y=8 and y=9, but cannot at T=11 because occupied.\n\nSo at T=10, we can stay at y=7 or go down or up, but up to y=8 at T=11 occupied, not good.\n\nSince y=7 is safe at T=10, but at T=11 it will be occupied, so we must leave y=7 before T=11.\n\nSimilarly for other levels.\n\nFrom T=10, at y=7, we can go down to a safe y for T=11.\n\nSafe y at T=11 are y=0,1,2,9\n\ny=9 is far, we are at y=7.\n\nGo down to y=6, but at T=11 y=6 occupied.\n\nSimilarly, to y=5, occupied.\n\nTo y=4, but y=4 occupied at T=11.\n\ny=3 occupied.\n\ny=2 is safe at T=11, since only occupied at T=6.\n\nSimilarly y=1 safe, y=0 safe.\n\nSo from y=7 at T=10, we can go down to y=6 at T=11, but occupied, or to y=8 occupied, or stay occupied.\n\nWith one action, we can only change by 1, so to y=6 or y=8 or y=7, all occupied at T=11.\n\nCannot reach y=2 or y=1 or y=0 in one step from y=7.\n\nSo impossible to be safe at T=11 from y=7 at T=10.\n\nTherefore, we must not be at y=7 at T=10; we need to be at a lower y earlier.\n\nFor example, at T=9, we are at y=6 if we went up continuously.\n\nIn the sequence, at T=9, position y=6 (from T=8 U to y=6 at T=9).\n\nAt T=9, y=6, safe.\n\nThen at T=9, we can choose action.\n\nIf we go U to y=7 at T=10, then at T=10 y=7, same problem.\n\nIf we go D to y=5 at T=10, then at T=10 y=5, which is safe at T=10 (occupied only T=11,12), so safe.\n\nThen at T=10, y=5, we need to go somewhere safe for T=11.\n\nSafe y at T=11: y=0,1,2,9\n\nFrom y=5, we can go down to y=4, but y=4 occupied at T=11.\n\ny=3 occupied.\n\ny=2 is safe, but from y=5 to y=2 in one step? No, only to y=4 or y=6 or stay.\n\nAll not safe at T=11.\n\ny=6 at T=11 occupied.\n\nSo from y=5 at T=10, action to y=4,5,6 all occupied at T=11.\n\nCannot reach safe y in one step.\n\nIf at T=9, we go down to y=5 at T=10, same as above.\n\nOr stay at y=6 at T=10, then at T=10 y=6 safe, but at T=11 if we go to y=6 or 5 or 7, all occupied.\n\nNo.\n\nSo we need to be at a safe y at T=9 or earlier.\n\nLet's list the position at T=9.\n\nFrom start, using path A:\n\nT=4 S, to y=2 at T=5\n\nT=5 U, to y=3 at T=6\n\nT=6 U, to y=4 at T=7\n\nT=7 U, to y=5 at T=8\n\nT=8 U, to y=6 at T=9\n\nAt T=9, y=6.\n\nNow, safe y at T=11 are y=0,1,2,9\n\nFrom y=6 at T=9, we have two actions to T=11: action at T=9 and T=10.\n\nAfter action at T=9, position at T=10.\n\nAfter action at T=10, position at T=11.\n\nWe need y_11 to be in {0,1,2,9}\n\ny_11 = y_9 + Δy_9 + Δy_10\n\ny_9 =6\n\nΔy_9 and Δy_10 each in {-1,0,1}\n\nSo y_11 = 6 + d9 + d10, where d9, d10 in {-1,0,1}\n\nSo y_11 between 4 and 8.\n\nBut safe y at T=11 are 0,1,2,9.\n\n4 to 8 are all occupied at T=11, and 3 is also occupied.\n\ny=3 occupied, y=4 occupied, etc.\n\ny_11 between 4 and 8, all of which are unsafe at T=11.\n\n0,1,2,9 are safe, but y_11 cannot be 0,1,2,9 from y=6 in two moves; min y_11=4, max 8.\n\nSo impossible to be safe at T=11 if we are at y=6 at T=9.\n\nSimilarly, if we are at lower y, it might be possible.\n\nFor example, at T=9, if we are at y=2 or lower.\n\nBut in our path, we are at y=6 at T=9.\n\nWe need to be at a lower y at T=9.\n\nFor that, we need to go down earlier or stay.\n\nFor example, at some point, we can stay or go down to be at lower y at T=9.\n\nThen from there, go to safe y at T=11.\n\nBut we want to minimize turns, so we should not go down too much.\n\nLet's define the turn when we reach high y.\n\nSince the problem is at T=11,12, we can be at y=3 or 4 before T=11, but they are occupied at T=11,12, so we need to be below or above.\n\ny=3 and y=4 are safe from T=6 to T=10, for example.\n\nFrom T=6 to T=10, y=3 to 8 are all safe, except that y=3 and y=4 are occupied at T=11,12, but T=6 to 10 are safe.\n\nT=6 to 10 inclusive.\n\nAt T=6, y=3 safe, T=7 y=4 safe, etc.\n\nAt T=10, y=7 safe, but then T=11 problem.\n\nSo during T=6 to T=10, we can be on y=3 to 8.\n\nBut at T=11, we need to be on y=0,1,2,9.\n\nSince y=9 is far, we can go to y=2 or 1 or 0.\n\nFor example, at T=10, we can be at y=2, then at T=11 safe.\n\nOr at y=1, etc.\n\nFrom the high position, we can go down to y=2 by T=10.\n\nThen at T=10, y=2, safe.\n\nThen at T=10, we can go up or stay, but we need to go to y=9 eventually.\n\nBut at T=10, y=2, we can start going up again.\n\nBut it will take more turns.\n\nLet's calculate the minimal H.\n\nFirst, from start to T=6, we are at y=3.\n\nThen from T=6 to T=10, we can go up to y=7, as before.\n\nBut at T=10, y=7, we can go down to y=6 at T=11, but occupied, not good.\n\nInstead, at some earlier turn, we go down to lower y.\n\nFor example, at T=8, we are at y=5 (from T=7 U to y=5 at T=8).\n\nAt T=8, y=5, safe.\n\nInstead of going up, we can go down to y=4 at T=9.\n\nThen at T=9, y=4, safe (not occupied at T=9).\n\nThen at T=9, we can go down to y=3 at T=10.\n\nThen at T=10, y=3, but y=3 is safe at T=10? y=3 occupied only at T=4,5,11,12, so at T=10 safe.\n\nThen at T=10, y=3, we can go down to y=2 at T=11.\n\nAt T=11, y=2, which is safe, as not occupied.\n\nThen from there, we can go up to y=3 at T=12, but y=3 occupied at T=12, collision.\n\nAt T=11, y=2, action U to y=3 at T=12, but y=3 occupied at T=12, collision.\n\nAction D to y=1 at T=12, y=1 safe at T=12 (only occupied T=6), so safe.\n\nAction S to y=2 at T=12, safe.\n\nBut we need to go up.\n\nSo from y=2 at T=11, we can go down to y=1 at T=12, safe, then up from there.\n\nBut slow.\n\nAt T=10, from y=3, instead of down, we can go down to y=2 directly if possible, but from y=3 to y=2 in one step.\n\nAt T=10, y=3, action D to y=2 at T=11.\n\nThen at T=11, y=2, safe.\n\nThen at T=11, we can go up to y=3 at T=12, but y=3 occupied at T=12, collision.\n\nGo down to y=1 at T=12, safe.\n\nThen from y=1 at T=12, we can go up.\n\nBut to reach y=9, it will take many turns.\n\nFor example, from T=12, y=1, go up to y=2 at T=13, safe.\n\nU to y=3 at T=14, but y=3 occupied at T=11,12, but T=14 is after, so safe if not occupied.\n\ny=3 occupied only at T=4,5,11,12, so at T=14 safe.\n\nSimilarly, U to y=4 at T=15, safe.\n\nU to y=5 at T=16, safe (occupied only T=11,12)\n\nU to y=6 at T=17, safe\n\nU to y=7 at T=18, safe\n\nU to y=8 at T=19, safe\n\nU to y=9 at T=20.\n\nThen at T=20, y=9, reached.\n\nBut this is at turn 20, which is late, H=17 turns from t1=4 to t=20, actions from t=4 to t=19, 16 actions? Let's count.\n\nStart at T=4, position.\n\nActions at T=4 to T=19 for 16 actions, to reach at T=20.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nSince at T=11, we can be at y=2, safe.\n\nThen at T=11, we can go up, but y=3 occupied at T=12, so we need to wait until T=13.\n\nAt T=11, y=2, action S, to y=2 at T=12, safe.\n\nThen at T=12, y=2, action U to y=3 at T=13.\n\nAt T=13, y=3, safe (not occupied).\n\nThen U to y=4 at T=14, safe.\n\nU to y=5 at T=15, safe\n\nU to y=6 at T=16\n\nU to y=7 at T=17\n\nU to y=8 at T=18\n\nU to y=9 at T=19\n\nReached at T=19.\n\nStill 15 actions from T=4 to T=18, position at T=19.\n\nActions at T=4 to T=18 for 15 actions, to be at y=9 at T=19.\n\nBut earlier we were at y=3 at T=6, so from T=6 to T=19, we used many turns.\n\nWe can be at higher y at T=10.\n\nFor example, at T=10, if we are at y=2, then we can go up from there.\n\nHow to be at y=2 at T=10.\n\nFrom start, at T=4, y=2.\n\nT=4 action S, to y=2 at T=5\n\nT=5 action, to not be at y=2 at T=6, so U to y=3 at T=6\n\nThen at T=6, y=3, we can go down or stay or up.\n\nBut we want to be at y=2 at T=10.\n\nFrom T=6 y=3, to T=10 y=2, that requires net down, not efficient.\n\nAt T=4, we can go down to y=1 at T=5, then to y=0 at T=6, then stay or up.\n\nBut low y.\n\nLet's accept that we need to be at a safe y at T=11, like y=2.\n\nFrom the beginning, with path A: T=4 S, T=5 U, to y=3 at T=6.\n\nThen at T=6, y=3, we can go down to y=2 at T=7.\n\nAt T=7, y=2, safe.\n\nThen at T=7, we can stay or move.\n\nBut we need to be at y=2 at T=11 or something.\n\nAt T=7, y=2, safe.\n\nWe can go up to y=3 at T=8, safe.\n\nBut then we are at y=3 at T=8, which is safe, but we need to avoid high y at T=11.\n\nSince y=3 is safe until T=10, we can go up to y=4 at T=9, etc., but then at T=10 we are high, and we need to go down to y=2 for T=11.\n\nFrom high y, going down takes time.\n\nFor example, at T=8, if we are at y=3, we can go to y=4 at T=9, y=5 at T=10, but then at T=10 y=5, we need to go to safe y at T=11, but from y=5 to y=2 in one step impossible.\n\nSo at T=10, we need to be at y=2 or 1 or 0.\n\nSo from earlier, at T=6, y=3, instead of going up, we go down to y=2 at T=7.\n\nThen at T=7, y=2, we can stay at y=2 for several turns, since y=2 safe except T=6, so at T=7,8,9,10,11,12 all safe except T=6 which is past.\n\ny=2 only occupied at T=6, so for T>6, safe.\n\nSimilarly for y=1.\n\nSo at T=7, y=2, we can stay there until we want to move up.\n\nBut we need to move up eventually.\n\nAt T=7, y=2, action S, to y=2 at T=8\n\nT=8 S, to y=2 at T=9\n\nT=9 S, to y=2 at T=10\n\nT=10 at y=2, safe.\n\nThen at T=10, we can start going up.\n\nBut at T=11, we are at y=3 if we go U at T=10, but y=3 occupied at T=11, collision.\n\nAt T=10, y=2, action U to y=3 at T=11, occupied, collision.\n\nAction S to y=2 at T=11, safe.\n\nAction D to y=1 at T=11, safe.\n\nBut if we stay or down, we don't progress.\n\nSo at T=10, we can only stay or down to be safe at T=11, then at T=11, we can go up.\n\nAt T=11, y=2, action U to y=3 at T=12, but y=3 occupied at T=12, collision.\n\nSo again, we need to wait until T=13 to go up.\n\nAt T=10, y=2, action S to y=2 at T=11, safe.\n\nThen at T=11, y=2, action S to y=2 at T=12, safe.\n\nThen at T=12, y=2, action U to y=3 at T=13, safe (not occupied).\n\nThen U to y=4 at T=14, safe\n\nU to y=5 at T=15\n\nU to y=6 at T=16\n\nU to y=7 at T=17\n\nU to y=8 at T18\n\nU to y=9 at T19\n\nReached at T19.\n\nH is large.\n\nTo reduce, we can be at higher y when possible.\n\nFor example, at T=6, we are at y=3.\n\nInstead of going down, we go up to y=4 at T=7, y=5 at T=8, y=6 at T=9.\n\nAt T=9, y=6, we can go down to y=5 at T=10.\n\nAt T=10, y=5, safe.\n\nBut at T=11, y=5 occupied, so we need to go down further.\n\nFrom y=5 at T=10, action D to y=4 at T=11, but y=4 occupied at T=11, collision.\n\nAction to y=6, occupied.\n\nNo.\n\nSo from T=9, y=6, action D to y=5 at T=10, then from there, we can only go to occupied y at T=11.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt T=9, y=6, action D to y=5 at T=10, but same.\n\nOr at T=9, go down twice? But we have only one action per turn.\n\nSo we need to start going down earlier.\n\nFor example, at T=8, we are at y=5 (from T=7 U to y=5 at T=8).\n\nAt T=8, y=5, action D to y=4 at T=9.\n\nAt T=9, y=4, safe.\n\nThen at T=9, action D to y=3 at T=10.\n\nAt T=10, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at T=10, action D to y=2 at T=11.\n\nAt T=11, y=2, safe.\n\nThen from there, as before, we can go up after T=12.\n\nAt T=11, y=2, action S to T=12 y=2, safe.\n\nT=12 U to y=3 at T=13, safe.\n\nThen U to y=4 at T=14, U to y=5 at T=15, U to y=6 at T=16, U to y=7 at T=17, U to y=8 at T18, U to y=9 at T19.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut from T=8 to T=9 we went down, etc.\n\nTo save time, at T=11, y=2, we can go directly up at T=12 to y=3, but occupied, so must wait.\n\nSince y=1 is also safe, we can go to y=1 at some point.\n\nBut similar.\n\nThe minimal H might be 15 or so.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach at turn 13.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn 13.\n\nThen at turn 12, we must be at y=8 or y=9.\n\nBut at turn 12, y=8 occupied, so cannot be on y=8.\n\nIf at turn 12, y=9, then action S to turn 13 y=9.\n\nOr if at turn 12, y=8, action U to y=9 at turn 13, but at turn 12, y=8 occupied, collision.\n\nSo only way is to be at y=9 at turn 12.\n\nThen to be at y=9 at turn 12, at turn 11, we must be at y=8 or y=9.\n\nAt turn 11, y=8 occupied, so cannot be on y=8.\n\nIf at turn 11, y=9, then action S to turn 12 y=9.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn 11, at turn 10, we must be at y=8 and action U at turn 10 to y=11=9.\n\nAt turn 10, y=8 is safe.\n\nSo we need to be at y=8 at turn 10.\n\nBut as before, from start, we cannot reach y=8 at turn 10 with all up because of the first move.\n\nUnless we can be at y=2 at turn 4, then go up at turn 4 to y=3, but occupied at turn 5.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo the earliest is turn 19 or we can optimize.\n\nAnother idea: at the beginning, go down to y=0 quickly, then go up from there, avoiding the occupied times.\n\nFor example:\n\nT=4: D to y=1 at T=5\n\nT=5: D to y=0 at T=6  (since at T=5, y=1, must move to avoid T=6, so D to y=0)\n\nT=6: at y=0, safe. Action U to y=1 at T=7\n\nT=7: U to y=2 at T=8\n\nT=8: U to y=3 at T=9\n\nT=9: U to y=4 at T=10\n\nT=10: U to y=5 at T=11, but y=5 occupied at T=11, collision.\n\nSame issue.\n\nAt T=10, from y=4, we can go down to y=3 at T=11, but y=3 occupied at T=11, collision.\n\nOr to y=5, occupied.\n\nSo not good.\n\nAt T=9, y=4, we can go down to y=3 at T=10, then to y=2 at T=11.\n\nAt T=10: from y=4 at T=9, action D to y=3 at T=10\n\nAt T=10, y=3, safe.\n\nAction D to y=2 at T=11\n\nAt T=11, y=2, safe.\n\nThen from there, after T=12, go up.\n\nBut to reach y=9, from y=2 at T=11, it takes 7 moves, so at turn 18 or 19.\n\nT=11 y=2, action U to y=3 at T=12, but y=3 occupied at T=12, collision.\n\nSo must wait.\n\nT=11 y=2, action S to y=2 at T=12, safe.\n\nT=12 U to y=3 at T=13, safe.\n\nThen U to y=4 at T=14, U to y=5 at T=15, U to y=6 at T=16, U to y=7 at T=17, U to y=8 at T18, U to y=9 at T19.\n\nReached at T19.\n\nH = 15 actions from T=4 to T=18.\n\nPosition at T=19.\n\nBut we can start going up earlier in the sequence.\n\nFor example, in the first part, after reaching y=3 at T=6, instead of going down, we go up to as high as possible before T=10, then go down to y=2 for T=11.\n\nFor example:\n\nT=4 S to T=5 y=2\n\nT=5 U to T=6 y=3\n\nT6 U to T7 y=4\n\nT7 U to T8 y=5\n\nT8 U to T9 y=6\n\nT9 U to T10 y=7\n\nAt T10 y=7, we need to go to y=2 for T11, but from y=7 to y=2 in one step impossible.\n\nWith actions at T10, we can only go to y=6,7,8 at T11, all occupied.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nTherefore, the only way is to be at y=2 at T11 by going down before.\n\nBut going down takes turns, so it delays the ascent.\n\nMinimal H is when we go up as much as possible before T10, then go down to y=2 at T11, but since we can only change by 1 per turn, from y=7 at T10 to y=6 at T11, occupied, not to y=2.\n\nSo we must be at low y at T10 to be at safe y at T11.\n\nFor example, at T10, we must be at y=2 to be at y=2 at T11 or go to y=1 or 0, but y=2 is safe at T11.\n\nSo at T10, be at y=2.\n\nThen from start, we need to be at y=2 at T10.\n\nFrom T4 y=2, to T10 y=2, that means no net move, so we can have stays or down and up, but net zero.\n\nBut we can have actions that keep us around y=2.\n\nFor example:\n\nT4 S to T5 y=2\n\nT5 U to T6 y=3\n\nT6 U to T7 y=4\n\nThen at T7, we can go down to y=3 at T8\n\nT8 D to y=2 at T9? Let's see.\n\nT7 at y=4, action D to y=3 at T8\n\nT8 at y=3, action D to y=2 at T9\n\nT9 at y=2, action S to y=2 at T10\n\nThen at T10 y=2, action S to y=2 at T11, safe.\n\nThen T11 S to y=2 at T12, safe.\n\nT12 U to y=3 at T13, safe.\n\nThen U to y=4 at T14, U to y=5 at T15, U to y=6 at T16, U to y=7 at T17, U to y=8 at T18, U to y=9 at T19.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAt T10, y=2, we can go U to y=3 at T11, but occupied, not good.\n\nSo we must wait.\n\nTo save one turn, at T12, after the occupation, we can go up faster, but from y=2 to y=9, 7 moves, so from T12 y=2 to T19 y=9, 7 moves in 7 turns.\n\nActions from T12 to T18 to reach at T19.\n\nBut we can be at higher y at T12.\n\nFor example, at T11 y=2, we can go U at T12 to y=3 at T13, but T12 action to T13 position.\n\nAt T12, we are at y=2 (from T11 S or something), action U to y=3 at T13.\n\nThen U to y=4 at T14, etc., to y=9 at T19.\n\nNo better.\n\nUnless we can be at y=3 at T13 directly, but same.\n\nSo minimal H is 15, with the sequence above.\n\nBut let's confirm with the car positions.\n\nPerhaps for y=5-8, the occupation at T=11,12 is for the cars, but at T=11, the span for y=5: car at [-53 +6*7, -42+6*7] = [-53+42, -42+42] = [-11,0] at T=11? Let's calculate.\n\nt1=4, ΔT = T-4\n\nAt T=11, ΔT=7\n\nFor y=5 car: (-42,-53,right,6), head -42, tail -53, span at T: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-53 +6*7, -42+6*7] = [-53+42, -42+42] = [-11,0]\n\n0 in span, yes.\n\nSimilarly at T=12, ΔT=8, [-53+48, -42+48] = [-5,6], 0 in it.\n\nBut for the player, if at T=11 on y=5, collision.\n\nSimilarly for other.\n\nSo I think the sequence is as above.\n\nBut in the answer, we need the minimal H and the sequence.\n\nPerhaps there is a faster way.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=9 directly from lower, but no.\n\nOr, since at T=4, we can go down to y=1, then to y=0, then from y=0, we can go up to y=1 at T=7, etc., but similar timing.\n\nLet's calculate the number.\n\nFrom T=4 to T=19, 15 turns, actions from T=4 to T=18.\n\nH=15 turns.\n\nBut H is the number of turns in the sequence, from t=0 to H-1 for the actions, but in the context, the sequence is for turns from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nThe player position at turn t1 is given, then actions at turn t1, t1+1, ..., up to turn t1+H-1, such that after H actions, at turn t1+H, position is (0,9).\n\nIn the task: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1\" and \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\"?\n\nLet's read.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nIn the player update: after action at turn t, position at turn t+1.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t, action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nSo at turn t1, position given, action a_{t1}, then position at t1+1, and so on, up to action at turn t1+H-1, then position at turn (t1+H-1) +1 = t1+H.\n\nBut we want position at turn t1+H-1 to be 9? No.\n\nThe reach condition: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\"\n\nFrom the task: \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nYes.\n\nSo after actions from t1 to t1+H-2, position at t1+H-1 is 9? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1+H-1, total H actions.\n\nAfter action at turn t, position at turn t+1.\n\nSo after action at turn t1+H-1, position at turn (t1+H-1)+1 = t1+H.\n\nBut we want position at turn t1+H-1 to be 9.\n\nThat means, at the turn when we take the last action, the position is already 9, or we reach after the action.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nSuppose at turn T, position y_T.\n\nThen we choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThe position at turn T is before the action or after? In the collision, it's at turn T, position y_T, and we check based on y_T.\n\nTo have y_T =9 for some T.\n\nFor T = t1 + H - 1, we want y_{t1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nThat means, at turn t1 + H - 1, position is 9.\n\nNow, this position is after the action of previous turn or before?\n\nAt turn t1, position given, then we take action a_{t1}, which affects y_{t1+1}.\n\nSo the position at turn t1 is given, no action yet.\n\nThen after action a_{t1} at turn t1, we have position at turn t1+1.\n\nSimilarly, after action at turn t1+k, position at turn t1+k+1.\n\nTo have position at turn t1 + H - 1 be 9, that means that after H-1 actions, from t1 to t1+H-2, position at t1+H-1 is 9.\n\nThen the last action a_{t1+H-1} might be at turn t1+H-1, but position at that turn is already 9, so action could be S or something.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t1 to t1+H-1, but the position at t1+H-1 is set by actions up to t1+H-2.\n\nLet k = H-1, so after k actions, position at t1+k is 9.\n\nThen the sequence has k+1 actions? I'm confused.\n\nFrom the answer format, it says \"Turn t1: a_{t1}\" up to \"Turn t1 + H - 1: a_{t1 + H - 1}\"\n\nAnd \"y_{t1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nBut y_{t1 + H - 1} is the position at turn t1+H-1.\n\nThis position is determined by the previous actions.\n\nSpecifically, y_{t1} is given.\n\nThen after action a_{t1} at turn t1, y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{a_{t1}}\n\nSimilarly, y_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} + Δy_{a_{t1+1}} and so on.\n\nSo y_{t1 + H - 1} depends on the actions from t1 to t1+H-2.\n\nThe last action a_{t1 + H - 1} is at turn t1+H-1, which affects y_{t1+H}, but we don't care about that.\n\nFor y_{t1 + H - 1} to be 9, it is set by actions from t1 to t1+H-2, and the action at t1+H-1 is not used for position, but we have to specify it, but it could be anything since we reached.\n\nBut in the sequence, we include it.\n\nTo minimize H, we want the smallest H such that with H actions, but the position is at turn t1+H-1.\n\nWith fewer actions, we can reach earlier turn.\n\nFor example, if we go up continuously, we can reach y=9 at turn t1+7 =4+7=11.\n\nBut as we saw, not possible.\n\nIn our case, with the sequence, we can reach at turn 19 with H actions.\n\nLet's define T_reach = turn when y=9.\n\nThen T_reach = t1 + H - 1 = 4 + H - 1\n\nWe want to minimize H, so minimize T_reach.\n\nMin T_reach is 11, but not achievable, so next is 12, but to be at y=9 at T=12, we need to be at y=9 at T=11 or arrive from y=8 at T=11, but y=8 occupied at T=11, so impossible.\n\nT=13: to be at y=9 at T=13, we can be at y=9 at T=12 or at y=8 at T=12 with action U at T=12 to y=13=9, but at T=12, y=8 occupied, so cannot.\n\nOr at y=9 at T=12 with action S to T=13 y=9.\n\nSo must be at y=9 at T=12.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=9 at T=12, must be at y=9 at T=11 or at y=8 at T=11 with U, but y=8 occupied at T=11.\n\nSo must be at y=9 at T=11.\n\nTo be at y=9 at T=11, must be at y=8 at T=10 with action U at T=10 to y=11=9.\n\nAt T=10, y=8 safe.\n\nSo need to be at y=8 at T=10.\n\nFrom start, at T=4 y=2, to T=10 y=8, with 6 actions (t=4 to 9), all U, but first U at T=4 leads to collision at T=5.\n\nSo impossible for T_reach=11.\n\nSimilarly for T=12, impossible as above.\n\nT=13: to be at y=9 at T=13, must be at y=9 at T=12 or at y=8 at T=12 with U, but y=8 occupied at T=12, so must be at y=9 at T=12.\n\nThen must be at y=9 at T=11, as above, impossible.\n\nT=14: to be at y=9 at T=14, can be at y=9 at T=13 or at y=8 at T=13 with U to y=14=9.\n\nAt T=13, y=8 safe, as not occupied.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=8 at T=13, we can arrive from lower.\n\nSo possible.\n\nT_reach=14, then H-1 = T_reach - t1 =14-4=10, so H=11.\n\nT_reach = t1 + H - 1, so 4 + H -1 =14, so H-1=10, H=11.\n\nActions from t=4 to t=4+11-1= t=14? Actions from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nt1=4, actions at 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 for H=10 actions? Let's calculate.\n\nT_reach = turn when y=9 = t1 + H - 1\n\nFor T_reach=14, 4 + H -1 =14, so 3+H=14, H=11.\n\nThen actions at turns t=4 to t=4+11-1= t=4 to 14, that's 11 actions.\n\nPosition at t=14 is y=9.\n\nTo have y=9 at t=14, it can be that at t=13, y=8 or 9, and action.\n\nIf at t=13 y=8, action U to y=14=9.\n\nIf at t=13 y=9, action S to y=14=9.\n\nAt t=13, y=8 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=8 at t=13.\n\nWe need to get to y=8 at t=13 from start.\n\nStart at t=4 y=2.\n\nNumber of actions from t=4 to t=12 to reach position at t=13? After actions at t=4 to t=12, position at t=13.\n\nActions at t=4 to t=12, 9 actions.\n\ny at t=13 = y_13 = y_4 + sum_{t=4 to 12} Δy_t\n\ny_4=2, want y_13=8, so sum Δy from t=4 to 12 must be +6.\n\n9 actions, so possible with 6 U, 3 S, for example.\n\nWe can have stays.\n\nNow, we need to avoid collisions.\n\nAt t=4, we cannot go U because of t=5 y=3 occupied.\n\nSo at t=4, action S or D.\n\nLet's take S at t=4, to y=2 at t=5.\n\nt=5 action U to y=3 at t=6 (since at t=5 y=2, U to y=3 at t=6)\n\nt=6 action U to y=4 at t=7\n\nt=7 U to y=5 at t=8\n\nt=8 U to y=6 at t=9\n\nt=9 U to y=7 at t=10\n\nt=10 U to y=8 at t=11, but at t=11, y=8 occupied, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt t=10, from y=7, we can do something else.\n\nBut we need to be at y=8 at t=13.\n\nAt t=10, we are at y=7, if we go U to y=8 at t=11, occupied.\n\nS to y=7 at t=11, occupied.\n\nD to y=6 at t=11, occupied.\n\nSo not good.\n\nInstead, at t=9, we are at y=6 (from t=8 U to y=6 at t=9)\n\nAt t=9, action S to y=6 at t=10\n\nThen at t=10, y=6, action S to y=6 at t=11, occupied, collision.\n\nOr action U to y=7 at t=11, occupied.\n\nD to y=5 at t=11, occupied.\n\nNo.\n\nAt t=9, action D to y=5 at t=10\n\nThen at t=10, y=5, action S to y=5 at t=11, occupied.\n\nOr U to y=6, occupied.\n\nD to y=4 at t=11, but y=4 occupied at t=11.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo we need to be at a safe place at t=11.\n\nFor example, at t=11, be at y=2.\n\nThen from there go to y=8 at t=13.\n\nBut to be at y=2 at t=11, from earlier.\n\nFor example, at t=10, be at y=2, then at t=10 action S to y=2 at t=11, safe.\n\nThen at t=11, y=2, action U to y=3 at t=12, but y=3 occupied at t=12, collision.\n\nSo must go to y=3 at t=13.\n\nAt t=11, y=2, action S to y=2 at t=12, safe.\n\nThen at t=12, y=2, action U to y=3 at t=13, safe.\n\nThen from t=13 y=3, we need to go to y=8 at t=13 for the position? No, for T_reach=14, we need y=9 at t=14, so at t=13, we can be at y=8 or 9.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=13, to y=8 at t=13 is impossible; position at t=13 is y=3.\n\nTo have y=8 at t=13, we need to be there at that turn.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=13, it takes 5 moves to y=8, so at t=18.\n\nNot for t=14.\n\nSo for T_reach=14, we need to be at high y at t=13.\n\nBut from the start, with the constraints, the earliest T_reach is 19.\n\nI think I should accept that and provide the sequence.\n\nMinimal H is 15 with T_reach=18? Let's define.\n\nSet t1=4.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 4: S  (y=2 at t=5)\n\nTurn 5: U  (y=3 at t=6)\n\nTurn 6: U  (y=4 at t=7)\n\nTurn 7: U  (y=5 at t=8)\n\nTurn 8: U  (y=6 at t=9)\n\nTurn 9: D  (y=5 at t=10)  // go down to avoid high y\n\nTurn 10: D  (y=4 at t=11) but at t=11, y=4 occupied, collision!\n\nMistake.\n\ny=4 occupied at t=11.\n\nTurn 9: at t=9 y=6, action D to y=5 at t=10\n\nTurn 10: at t=10 y=5, action D to y=4 at t=11, but y=4 occupied at t=11.\n\nNot good.\n\nTurn 10 action D to y=4, but occupied.\n\nSo not.\n\nTurn 9: at t=9 y=6, action D to y=5 at t=10\n\nThen turn 10: action D to y=4 at t=11, occupied.\n\nOr turn 10 action U to y=6 at t=11, occupied.\n\nNo.\n\nSo only way is to go down to y=2 at t=11.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 4: S  (y=2 at t=5)\n\nTurn 5: U  (y=3 at t=6)\n\nTurn 6: D  (y=2 at t=7)  // go down to y=2\n\nTurn 7: S  (y=2 at t=8)\n\nTurn 8: S  (y=2 at t=9)\n\nTurn 9: S  (y=2 at t=10)\n\nTurn 10: S  (y=2 at t=11)  // safe at t=11\n\nTurn 11: S  (y=2 at t=12)  // safe at t=12\n\nTurn 12: U  (y=3 at t=13)  // after occupation\n\nTurn 13: U  (y=4 at t=14)\n\nTurn 14: U  (y=5 at t=15)\n\nTurn 15: U  (y=6 at t=16)\n\nTurn 16: U  (y=7 at t=17)\n\nTurn 17: U  (y=8 at t=18)\n\nTurn 18: U  (y=9 at t=19)\n\nPosition at t=19 is y=9, so T_reach=19.\n\nH is the number of actions, from turn 4 to turn 18, 15 actions.\n\nt1 + H - 1 = 4 + H -1 =19, so H-1=15, H=16? Let's calculate.\n\nT_reach = t1 + H - 1 =19\n\n4 + H -1 =19, so 3 + H =19, H=16.\n\nActions at turn 4 to turn 4+16-1= turn 19? Actions from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nt1=4, H=16, actions at t=4 to t=4+15= t=19? t1+H-1=4+16-1=19.\n\nPosition at turn t1+H-1=19 is y=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, actions at turn 4 to turn 18 for 15 actions, position at turn 19.\n\nActions from turn 4 to turn 18 inclusive is 15 actions ( turns 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18)\n\nThen position at turn 19 is y=9.\n\nSo number of actions H=15.\n\nThen t1+H-1=4+15-1=18, but position at turn 18 is y=8, not 9.\n\nMistake.\n\nIn the sequence, after action at turn 18, position at turn 19.\n\nAt turn 18, position y=8 (from previous), action U, so y_19=9.\n\nBut we want position at turn t1+H-1 to be 9.\n\nt1+H-1 =4+15-1=18, but at turn 18, position is y=8, not 9.\n\nSo we need position at turn 18 to be 9.\n\nSo in the sequence, after action at turn 17, position at turn 18 should be 9.\n\nSo action at turn 17 should be from y=8 to y=9 or stay at y=9.\n\nIn the above, at turn 17, position y=8 ( from action at turn 17? Let's list positions.\n\nTurn 4: start y=2\n\nAction a4: S, then y5=2\n\na5: U, y6=3\n\na6: D, y7=2\n\na7: S, y8=2\n\na8: S, y9=2\n\na9: S, y10=2\n\na10: S, y11=2\n\na11: S, y12=2\n\na12: U, y13=3\n\na13: U, y14=4\n\na14: U, y15=5\n\na15: U, y16=6\n\na16: U, y17=7\n\na17: U, y18=8\n\na18: U, y19=9\n\nPosition at turn 18 is y=8, not 9.\n\nTo have position at turn 18 be 9, we need y18=9.\n\nThat means after action at turn 17, y18=9.\n\nSo at turn 17, position y17, action such that y18=9, so y17=8 and action U, or y17=9 and action S.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 17, we have y17=7, action U to y18=8.\n\nNot 9.\n\nSo to have y18=9, we need to be at y=8 or 9 at turn 17.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 17, y=7.\n\nSo we need to reach y=8 earlier.\n\nFor example, at turn 17, y=8.\n\nThen action U to y18=9.\n\nOr if y=9, action S.\n\nBut to be at y=8 at turn 17, from start.\n\nWith more up actions.\n\nBut we have stays in the early part.\n\nFor example, in the sequence, from turn 12 to turn 17, we have actions U from y=2 to y=7 in 5 moves?

No, at turn 16 action U to y=7 at t=17.\n\ny17=7.\n\nThen turn 17 U to y18=8.\n\nSo y18=8.\n\nTo have y18=9, we can have at turn 17 action U from y=8, but we are at y=7.\n\nSo we need to be at y=8 at turn 17.\n\nThat means at turn 16, y16=7 or 8, and action.\n\nBut from turn 12 U to y=3 at t=13, then U at turn 13 to y=4 at t=14, U at turn 14 to y=5 at t=15, U at turn 15 to y=6 at t=16, U at turn 16 to y=7 at t=17, then at turn 17 U to y=8 at t=18.\n\nTo have y17=8, we need at turn 16 y16=7 and action U, or y16=8 action S.\n\nBut in the sequence, y16=6, so at turn 16 action U to y17=7, not 8.\n\nSo to have y17=8, we need to start going up earlier or have less stays.\n\nFor example, at turn 12, instead of U to y=3, we can be at higher y, but we are at y=2 at turn 12.\n\nSo we can remove some stays in the early part.\n\nFor example, at turn 6, instead of staying, go up.\n\nBut let's list a sequence with fewer stays.\n\nTurn 4: S (y5=2)\n\nTurn 5: U (y6=3)\n\nTurn 6: U (y7=4)  // instead of D or S\n\nTurn 7: U (y8=5)\n\nTurn 8: U (y9=6)\n\nTurn 9: U (y10=7)\n\nAt t=10 y=7, we need to go to y=2 for t=11, impossible.\n\nTurn 9: at t=9 y=6, action D to y5 at t=10\n\nThen at t=10 y=5, action D to y4 at t=11, but y4 occupied.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo I think it's not possible to reach before t=19.\n\nPerhaps at t=19, y=9 with H=16 actions.\n\nBut for the sequence, we can have:\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: D  // to go down to y=2\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nTurn 10: S\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U  // position at turn 19 y=9, but we want at turn 18.\n\nTo have position at turn 18 y=9, we need to be at y=8 or 9 at turn 17.\n\nBut with the above, at turn 17 y=7.\n\nSo add one more U earlier.\n\nFor example, at turn 6, instead of D, do U to y=4 at t=7, then U to y=5 at t=8, but then at t=10 we are high, and we go down to y=2 at t=11, but from y=5 at t=10 to y=2 at t=11 impossible.\n\nSo not.\n\nTherefore, the minimal is to reach at turn 19 with the sequence above, and for the action at turn 18, we do U to reach y=9 at turn 19.\n\nThen for the answer, H=16, with actions from turn 4 to turn 19, but position at turn 19 is 9, which is t1+H-1=4+16-1=19.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: D\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nTurn 10: S\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nThen position at turn 19 y=9.\n\nBut in the sequence, turn 18 action U, which is fine.\n\nTo make H smaller, we can reduce the number of stays.\n\nFor example, at turn 6, after U to y=3 at t=6, we can stay at y=3 for fewer turns.\n\nTurn 4: S (y5=2)\n\nTurn 5: U (y6=3)\n\nTurn 6: S (y7=3)\n\nTurn 7: S (y8=3)\n\nTurn 8: S (y9=3)\n\nTurn 9: S (y10=3)\n\nTurn 10: D (y11=2)  // go down to y=2 at t=11\n\nTurn 11: S (y12=2)\n\nTurn 12: U (y13=3)\n\nTurn 13: U (y14=4)\n\nTurn 14: U (y15=5)\n\nTurn 15: U (y16=6)\n\nTurn 16: U (y17=7)\n\nTurn 17: U (y18=8)\n\nTurn 18: U (y19=9)\n\nSame as before.\n\nAt turn 12, we are at y=2, U to y=3 at t=13, etc.\n\nTo have y18=8, then action at turn 18 U to y19=9, but we want y18=9.\n\nSo to have y18=9, in this sequence, at turn 17 y=7, U to y18=8.\n\nNot 9.\n\nSo we need an additional U somewhere.\n\nBut we can't.\n\nTherefore, for the purpose, I think this is the minimal.\n\nSo H=16, sequence as above.\n\nBut let's confirm the collision avoidance.\n\nAt t=4, y=2, safe\n\nt=5, y=2, safe\n\nt=6, y=3, safe (not occupied)\n\nt=7, y=3, safe\n\nt=8, y=3, safe\n\nt=9, y=3, safe\n\nt=10, y=3, safe\n\nt=11, y=2, safe\n\nt=12, y=2, safe\n\nt=13, y=3, safe\n\nt=14, y=4, safe\n\nt=15, y=5, safe\n\nt=16, y=6, safe\n\nt=17, y=7, safe\n\nt=18, y=8, safe (not occupied at t=18)\n\nt=19, y=9, reached.\n\nActions as above.\n\nFor the answer, H=16.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: S  // I changed from D to S to stay at y=3\n\nIn the sequence above, turn 6: S to y=3 at t=7\n\nThen stays until turn 9: S to y=3 at t=10\n\nTurn 10: D to y=2 at t=11\n\netc.\n\nYes.\n\nTo make it shorter, but I think it's minimal.\n\nSo for the box.\n\nBut the player starts at (0,2) at t=4, and we need to reach (0,9).\n\nWith this, it works.\n\nMinimal H might be less, but I think not.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 4\\) is 16. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by staying at safe positions during occupied turns and moving vertically when possible.\n\n### Occupied Times for Freeways:\n- **y=1 and y=2**: Occupied only at turn 6.\n- **y=3 and y=4**: Occupied at turns 4, 5, 11, and 12.\n- **y=5 to y=8**: Occupied at turns 11 and 12.\n- **y=0 and y=9**: Always safe (no cars).\n\n### Strategy:\n- From turn 4 to turn 5: Stay at \\(y=2\\) (safe, as \\(y=2\\) is not occupied at turn 5).\n- Turn 5: Move up to \\(y=3\\) (safe at turn 6, as \\(y=3\\) is not occupied).\n- Turns 6 to 9: Stay at \\(y=3\\) to avoid moving into occupied areas early and wait out the occupation at \\(y=3\\) and \\(y=4\\) until after turn 5. \\(y=3\\) is safe from turns 6 to 10.\n- Turn 10: Move down to \\(y=2\\) to avoid being on \\(y=3\\) to \\(y=8\\) during turns 11 and 12 when they are occupied. \\(y=2\\) is safe at turn 11.\n- Turn 11: Stay at \\(y=2\\) (safe, as \\(y=2\\) is not occupied).\n- Turn 12: Move up to \\(y=3\\) (safe at turn 13, as occupation at \\(y=3\\) ended after turn 12).\n- Turns 13 to 18: Move up continuously to reach \\(y=9\\) by turn 19. All intermediate freeways are safe during these turns.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions for turns \\(t_1 + t\\) from \\(t = 0\\) to \\(H-1 = 15\\) (i.e., turns 4 to 19) is as follows. Each action determines the position at the next turn, and collisions are avoided at each turn based on the car positions.\n\n- Turn 4: \\(S\\) (stay) → Position at turn 5: \\(y=2\\) (safe, not occupied)\n- Turn 5: \\(U\\) (up) → Position at turn 6: \\(y=3\\) (safe, not occupied)\n- Turn 6: \\(S\\) (stay) → Position at turn 7: \\(y=3\\) (safe, not occupied)\n- Turn 7: \\(S\\) (stay) → Position at turn 8: \\(y=3\\) (safe, not occupied)\n- Turn 8: \\(S\\) (stay) → Position at turn 9: \\(y=3\\) (safe, not occupied)\n- Turn 9: \\(S\\) (stay) → Position at turn 10: \\(y=3\\) (safe, not occupied)\n- Turn 10: \\(D\\) (down) → Position at turn 11: \\(y=2\\) (safe, not occupied)\n- Turn 11: \\(S\\) (stay) → Position at turn 12: \\(y=2\\) (safe, not occupied)\n- Turn 12: \\(U\\) (up) → Position at turn 13: \\(y=3\\) (safe, not occupied)\n- Turn 13: \\(U\\) (up) → Position at turn 14: \\(y=4\\) (safe, not occupied)\n- Turn 14: \\(U\\) (up) → Position at turn 15: \\(y=5\\) (safe, not occupied)\n- Turn 15: \\(U\\) (up) → Position at turn 16: \\(y=6\\) (safe, not occupied)\n- Turn 16: \\(U\\) (up) → Position at turn 17: \\(y=7\\) (safe, not occupied)\n- Turn 17: \\(U\\) (up) → Position at turn 18: \\(y=8\\) (safe, not occupied)\n- Turn 18: \\(U\\) (up) → Position at turn 19: \\(y=9\\) (reached goal)\n\nPosition at turn 19 (\\(t_1 + H - 1 = 4 + 16 - 1 = 19\\)) is \\((0, 9)\\), satisfying the goal. \\(H = 16\\) is minimal because reaching \\(y=9\\) earlier (e.g., by turn 11) is impossible due to collisions on intermediate freeways during occupied turns (e.g., \\(y=3\\) at turn 5 or \\(y=8\\) at turn 11), and alternative paths with fewer turns lead to collisions or require more delays.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 4: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 3) at turn t_1 = 6. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-coordinate by +1, -1, or 0 respectively, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T where for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn T. The note says that when you move to a new freeway, you are not on that freeway until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T you are still on y, and you arrive at y+1 at turn T+1.\n\nThe car spans are given at turn t_1=6, and we need to compute their positions at future turns based on their speed and direction.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars for each freeway at t_1=6:\n\n- Freeway 1: one car: head h=-24, tail τ=11, direction left, speed s=36. Since it's left-moving, the span moves left over time.\n\nFor left-moving cars: at time T, span is [h - s(T - t_1), τ - s(T - t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]\n\nt_1=6.\n\nAlso, collision only if 0 is in the span at turn T for the freeway the player is on at that turn.\n\nPlayer starts at y=3.\n\nI need to get to y=9, so I need to move up. But I have to avoid the cars on y=1 to 8.\n\nSince y=9 is the goal, and there are no cars on y=9, I think, because freeways are y=1 to 8. y=0 and y=9 might be safe, but the player is on y=3 now, and needs to reach y=9.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think, so no cars there. But the player can be on y=0 or y=9 without collision, I assume.\n\nThe freeways are specified as y=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe zones.\n\nThe collision is only with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nSo when player is on y=0 or y=9, no collision possible.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,3), which is on freeway y=3, I think? Position is (x,y), but x is always 0? The grid is 2D, but the player is always at x=0, I believe, since it says \"on a 2D grid\" but the position is given as (0, y), and cars are on freeways, which are rows, I think.\n\nThe player moves vertically, changing y, while x is fixed at 0. Cars are on horizontal freeways at different y levels, moving left or right.\n\nSo for the player, at each turn, y_t determines which freeway they are on, and collision if on that freeway, 0 is in some car's span at that turn.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when 0 is occupied by a car at different turns.\n\nFirst, let's compute for each freeway the times when 0 is covered by a car.\n\nStart with freeway 1: y=1\n\nCars: only one car: h=-24, τ=11, d=left, s=36\n\nAt time T, span: [h - s(T-6), τ - s(T-6)] = [-24 -36(T-6), 11 -36(T-6)]\n\nSince left-moving.\n\nNow, 0 is in span if min <= 0 <= max, but since it's a span, [start, end], and for left-moving, head is left, so h is smaller? Let's see.\n\nHead h=-24, tail τ=11, but for left-moving, head is at the left end, I think, so the car extends from h to τ, with h < τ since it's moving left? In the description, for left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ], and since moving left, h decreases.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1: (-24, 11, left, 36), so h=-24, τ=11, and since left-moving, at t1, the car is from x=-24 to x=11.\n\nAs time increases, both decrease, so the car moves left.\n\n0 is in span at T if:\n\n-24 -36(T-6) <= 0 <= 11 -36(T-6)\n\nLet k = T - 6, so time offset from t1.\n\nSo inequality:\n\n-24 -36k <= 0 <= 11 -36k\n\nNow, left part: -24 -36k <= 0 => -36k <= 24 => multiply by -1, reverse inequality: 36k >= -24, so k >= -24/36 = -2/3, but k >=0 since T>=t1, so always true for k>=0? -24 -36k <=0 for all k>=0, since both negative.\n\n-24 -36k is always negative for k>=0, so <=0 is always true.\n\nRight part: 0 <= 11 -36k => 11 -36k >=0 => 11 >= 36k => k <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305\n\nSo for k <= 11/36, approximately k<=0.305\n\nSince k integer (turns), k=0,1,...\n\nk<=0.305, so only k=0.\n\nk=0: T=6\n\nAt T=6, k=0, -24 <=0<=11, yes 0 is between -24 and 11.\n\nAt k=1, T=7, -24 -36(1) = -60, 11-36= -25, so span [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for higher k.\n\nSo for freeway 1, 0 is occupied only at T=6.\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1? Cars: (-24,11,left,36), identical to freeway 1.\n\nSo similarly, only at T=6, 0 occupied.\n\nNow freeway 3: y=3\n\nCars: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-30, -41, right, 6) ? Head h, tail τ, direction.\n\n(-30, -41, right, 6)\n\nBut for right-moving, the span is given with head and tail, but in the description, for right-moving, it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" and then moves right.\n\nIn the car state, it's listed as (head, tail, direction, speed), but for direction, it specifies how to interpret.\n\nFor freeway 3: cars are: (-30, -41, right, 6), (48, 37, right, 6), (12, 1, right, 6)\n\nNow for right-moving, at t1, span is [τ, h], I think? Let's see the update rule.\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (h, τ, d, s), so for right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h]? But in the list, for first car: (-30, -41, right, 6)\n\nh=-30, τ=-41? But if right-moving, span should be [τ, h], so τ should be left end, h right end.\n\nBut here h=-30, τ=-41, and since -41 < -30, if [τ, h] = [-41, -30], which is from left to right.\n\nThen moving right, so positions increase.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (48,37,right,6), h=48, τ=37, but 37<48, so [τ,h] = [37,48]\n\nThird car: (12,1,right,6), h=12, τ=1, [1,12]\n\nAll right-moving.\n\nAt time T, for each car, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\ns=6 for all.\n\nk = T-6\n\nFirst car: τ=-41, h=-30, so span at T: [-41 + 6k, -30 + 6k]\n\n0 in span if -41 +6k <= 0 <= -30 +6k\n\nBut -41 +6k <=0 and 0<= -30 +6k\n\nFirst inequality: -41 +6k <=0 => 6k <=41 => k <= 41/6 ≈6.833\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -30 +6k => 30 <=6k => k >=5\n\nSo for k>=5 and k<=6.833, so k=5,6\n\nSimilarly, second car: τ=37, h=48, span at T: [37+6k, 48+6k]\n\n0 in span: 37+6k <=0 <=48+6k\n\nBut 37+6k >=37>0 for k>=0, so left part 37+6k <=0 false always, so 0 never in span for this car.\n\nSimilarly, third car: τ=1, h=12, span [1+6k, 12+6k]\n\n0 in span: 1+6k <=0 <=12+6k\n\n1+6k <=0 => 6k <= -1, impossible for k>=0, so never.\n\nSo for freeway 3, only first car can cover 0, at k=5 and k=6, i.e., T=11 and T=12.\n\nk=5: T=11, k=6: T=12.\n\nNow freeway 4: cars same as freeway 3? (-30,-41,right,6), (48,37,right,6), (12,1,right,6)\n\nIdentical to freeway 3, so same: 0 occupied at T=11 and T=12.\n\nNow freeway 5: only one car: (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nSimilar to first car on freeway 3.\n\nτ=-41, h=-30, right-moving, span at T: [-41 +6k, -30 +6k]\n\n0 in span: -41+6k <=0 <= -30+6k\n\nk >= ceil(30/6)=5? 0 <= -30+6k => 6k >=30 => k>=5\n\n-41+6k <=0 => 6k<=41 => k<=6.833, so k=5,6\n\nT=11,12\n\nSimilarly freeway 6: same car (-30,-41,right,6), so T=11,12 occupied.\n\nFreeway 7: same, (-30,-41,right,6), T=11,12\n\nFreeway 8: same, (-30,-41,right,6), T=11,12\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway when 0 is occupied:\n\n- y=1: only at T=6\n\n- y=2: only at T=6\n\n- y=3: at T=11 and T=12\n\n- y=4: at T=11 and T=12\n\n- y=5: at T=11 and T=12\n\n- y=6: at T=11 and T=12\n\n- y=7: at T=11 and T=12\n\n- y=8: at T=11 and T=12\n\ny=3 has cars, and at T=11,12 occupied, similarly for others.\n\nPlayer starts at T=6, y=3.\n\nAt T=6, on y=3, but y=3 is occupied at T=6? For y=3, we have occupation at T=11 and 12, but not at T=6.\n\nFor y=3, at T=6, k=0, span of cars: first car [-41, -30], which is negative, so 0 not in. Second [37,48], not 0. Third [1,12], which includes 0? At T=6, k=0, for third car, span [1+0,12+0]=[1,12], and 0 is not in [1,12], since 1>0? 1 to 12, 0 is less than 1, so not included.\n\nSimilarly, first car [-41,-30], 0 not in. Second [37,48], not. So at T=6, on y=3, no car has 0 in span, so safe.\n\nBut for y=1 and y=2, at T=6, occupied.\n\nPlayer is at y=3 at T=6, which is safe.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nEach action changes y by +1, -1, 0, but y capped at 0 and 9.\n\nSince I need to go up to 9, and from 3, I need at least 6 steps up, but I might need to wait or something to avoid collisions.\n\nThe dangerous times are when I am on a freeway that has 0 occupied at that turn.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- For y=1 and y=2, only dangerous at T=6, but T=6 is now, and player is not on y=1 or 2 now, so as long as I don't stay on y=1 or 2 at T=6, but since it's only at T=6, and T=6 is past when I move, I think.\n\nT=6 is the current turn, but for collision, at each turn including future.\n\nBut for y=1 and y=2, 0 is occupied only at T=6, not at other times.\n\nSimilarly, for y=3 to y=8, occupied only at T=11 and T=12.\n\ny=3 to 8 all occupied at T=11 and 12.\n\nNow, y=9 has no cars, safe.\n\ny=0 also safe.\n\nPlayer starts at T=6, y=3.\n\nI need to get to y=9 as fast as possible.\n\nMinimal H: since from 3 to 9, difference 6, so if I move up every turn, I can reach in 6 turns: at T=6, y=3; after action, at T=7, y=4 if U; let's define the turns.\n\nTurn t: at the beginning of turn t, player is at position, then chooses action, then after action, at turn t+1, position updates.\n\nThe sequence: at turn t, player is at y_t, chooses action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nAnd at turn t, the player is on freeway y_t, and we check collision for that turn based on cars at turn t.\n\nIn the collision rule: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\"\n\ny_T is the player's y at turn T.\n\nAnd the note: when you move, at turn T, you are on y_T, and if you move to a new y, you arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nSo for example, at turn T, you are on y_T, you choose action, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nNow, for the path to be safe, for each turn T from start to end, when player is on y_T, it must not be that 0 is occupied on that freeway at turn T.\n\nIn this case, start at T=6, y=3.\n\nAt T=6, y=3, which is safe, as we saw.\n\nNow, I want to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nIf I go up every turn:\n\nStart T=6, y=3\n\nAfter a_6, y_7 = y_6 + Δy_6\n\nIf a_t = U, then y_{t+1} = y_t + 1\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo if I do U every turn:\n\nT=6: y=3, safe\n\na_6=U, so y_7=4\n\nT=7: y=4, now need to check if y=4 occupied at T=7.\n\nFrom above, y=4 occupied only at T=11,12, not at T=7, so safe.\n\na_7=U, y_8=5\n\nT=8: y=5, occupied only at T=11,12, safe\n\na_8=U, y_9=6\n\nT=9: y=6, occupied only at T=11,12? T=9 not 11 or 12, safe\n\na_9=U, y_10=7\n\nT=10: y=7, safe (not 11 or 12)\n\na_10=U, y_11=8\n\nT=11: y=8, now y=8 is occupied at T=11, since for y=8, at T=11, 0 is covered.\n\nFor y=8, same as others, occupied at T=11 and 12.\n\nSo at T=11, if player is on y=8, collision.\n\nIn this path, at T=11, y=8, which is occupied, so collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I continue:\n\na_10=U, y_11=8, so at T=11, on y=8, occupied, collision.\n\nIf I go up to y=9 earlier.\n\nAfter T=10, y=7, if I do U, to y=8 at T=11.\n\nBut at T=11, on y=8, collision.\n\nIf I do something else.\n\nPerhaps I need to avoid being on y=3 to y=8 at T=11 and T=12.\n\nSpecifically, for any y from 3 to 8, if I am on it at T=11 or T=12, collision.\n\ny=1 and y=2 are only dangerous at T=6, which is past.\n\nSo the critical times are T=11 and T=12.\n\nI need to not be on any freeway from 3 to 8 at T=11 and T=12.\n\nBut y=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\ny=9 is the goal, so if I can be on y=9 at or before T=11, or on y=0.\n\nBut y=0 is bottom, I need to go up.\n\nSince I start at y=3, and need to go to y=9, I have to pass through y=4 to y=8.\n\nBut I should not be on these when T=11 or 12.\n\nThe turns are discrete.\n\nList the turns from T=6 onwards.\n\nPlayer position at turn T:\n\nT=6: y=3\n\nThen after actions.\n\nI need to reach y=9 by some turn, with minimal H, meaning minimal number of actions to reach.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, and at turn t_1 + H - 1, position is (0,9).\n\nStart at turn t_1=6, position (0,3).\n\nAfter H turns, at turn 6 + H - 1? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t= t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, so H actions, and after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position is updated to (0,9), but the position at turn t is before action or after?\n\nClarify.\n\nAt turn t, player is at position y_t.\n\nThen chooses action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, we check collision based on y_t and cars at turn t.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, the position is y_{t_1 + H}, and we want this to be 9.\n\nThe last action is at turn t_1 + H - 1, which sets y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nAnd at turn t_1 + H, we are at (0,9), so we don't need to check collision there, I think, since it's the goal, or we do? The goal is to reach (0,9), and collision is only with cars on freeways, but y=9 has no freeway, so safe. Similarly, when we arrive at y=9, no collision.\n\nBut at the turn when we are at y=9, it should be fine.\n\nNow, for the path to be safe, for each turn from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, when we are at y_t, no collision.\n\nt from 6 to (6 + H - 1), y_t must be safe.\n\nAt turn 6 + H, we are at y=9, which is safe.\n\nNow, back to the plan.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=3 to y=8 at T=11 and T=12.\n\nPossible ways:\n\n- Be on y=9 or y=0 at T=11 and T=12.\n\nBut y=0 is down, I need to go up, so y=9 is better.\n\n- Or, be on y=3 to y=8, but only when it's not T=11 or 12. But for each y, it might be safe at other times, but in this case, for y=3 to 8, only dangerous at T=11,12, and safe at other times.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 and 2 only dangerous at T=6.\n\nBut since I start at T=6, y=3, which is not y=1 or 2, and T=6 is only dangerous for y=1 and 2, not for y=3.\n\nSo for y=3 to 8, safe except at T=11 and 12.\n\nTherefore, to avoid collision, I must not be on any y from 3 to 8 at turn T=11 or T=12.\n\nThat means at T=11, I must be on y=0, y=9, or y=1 or y=2, but y=1 and y=2 are only dangerous at T=6, and since T=11>6, they are safe at T=11, because no occupation except T=6.\n\nFor y=1, occupation only at T=6, so at T=7,8,etc, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=2.\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nSo at T=11, I can be on y=0,1,2,9.\n\nSimilarly at T=12, same thing.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nNow, since I start at T=6, y=3.\n\nI need to get to y=9 as fast as possible, but I have to handle T=11 and T=12.\n\nThe critical turns are T=11 and 12.\n\nNow, from T=6 to T=11, there are 5 turns: T=6,7,8,9,10.\n\nAt T=6, I am at y=3.\n\nI need to be at some safe y at T=11 and T=12.\n\nBut since T=12 is after, I can be at different positions.\n\nFirst, let's think about where I can be at T=11.\n\nI must be on y<=2 or y=9 at T=11.\n\nSimilarly for T=12.\n\nBut y=9 is the goal, so if I can reach y=9 before T=11, that would be good.\n\nCan I reach y=9 by T=10 or earlier?\n\nFrom T=6, y=3, to y=9, min 6 steps up.\n\nIf I go up every turn:\n\nT=6: y=3\n\na6=U, y7=4\n\nT=7: y=4\n\na7=U, y8=5\n\nT=8: y=5\n\na8=U, y9=6\n\nT=9: y=6\n\na9=U, y10=7\n\nT=10: y=7\n\na10=U, y11=8\n\nAt T=11, y=8, which is not safe, as it will be occupied.\n\nIf I go up faster, but I can only move one step per turn, so I can't reach faster than 6 turns.\n\nTo reach y=9, from y=3, need at least 6 up moves, so the earliest I can be at y=9 is at T=12: if I start at T=6 y=3, after 6 U moves:\n\nAfter a6=U, T=7 y=4\n\n...\n\nAfter a10=U, T=11 y=8? Let's count the turns.\n\nAt turn T=6, y=3\n\nAfter a6=U, at T=7, y=4\n\nAfter a7=U, T=8, y=5\n\na8=U, T=9, y=6\n\na9=U, T=10, y=7\n\na10=U, T=11, y=8\n\na11=U, T=12, y=9\n\nSo at T=12, y=9.\n\nBut at T=11, I am at y=8, which is occupied, collision.\n\nAt T=12, I am at y=9, safe.\n\nBut at T=11, collision on y=8.\n\nSo this path has collision at T=11.\n\nI need to not be on y=8 at T=11.\n\nOne way is to reach y=9 earlier, but I can't, because min 6 moves.\n\nI could stay on some y or move down to avoid being on dangerous y at critical times.\n\nFor example, I could go up to y=9, but delay so that at T=11, I am not on y=3-8.\n\nSince I have to pass through, I might need to be on y=0,1,2 at T=11.\n\ny=1 and y=2 are safe except at T=6, which is past.\n\nSo I could go down to y=2 or y=1 or y=0 at T=11.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nLet me consider the turns.\n\nT=6: y=3, safe\n\nI need to choose actions for t=6 to t=11 or so.\n\nAt T=11, I must be on y<=2 or y=9.\n\nSimilarly at T=12, must be on y<=2 or y=9.\n\nBut if I am on y=9 at T=11, that's good, but I can't reach by T=11 with 6 up moves from y=3 at T=6.\n\nTo be at y=9 at T=11: that would require y at T=6 to be higher, but it's 3.\n\nThe position at T=11 depends on actions from T=6 to T=10.\n\nActions a6 to a10 determine y11.\n\nSimilarly, y at T=6 is fixed.\n\ny11 = y6 + sum_{t=6 to 10} Δy_t\n\nΔy_t is -1,0,+1 depending on action.\n\ny6=3.\n\nTo have y11=9, need sum of Δy from t=6 to 10 to be +6, since y11 = y6 + Δy6 + ... + Δy10\n\ny_t for t>6: y_t = y6 + sum_{i=6}^{t-1} Δy_i\n\nFor example, y7 = y6 + Δy6\n\ny8 = y6 + Δy6 + Δy7\n\n...\n\ny11 = y6 + Δy6 + Δy7 + Δy8 + Δy9 + Δy10\n\nSince y6=3, to have y11=9, need Δy6 + ... + Δy10 = 6\n\nEach Δy <=1, so min 6 up moves, but there are 5 actions: t=6,7,8,9,10, that affect y11.\n\nActions from t=6 to t=10, 5 actions, each can contribute at most +1, so max y11 can be is y6 +5 = 3+5=8.\n\nSimilarly, min 3-5= -2, but y>=0.\n\nSo with actions at t=6 to t=10, y11 <= 8.\n\nCannot reach y=9 by T=11.\n\nSimilarly, y11 can be at most 8.\n\nSo at T=11, I must be on y<=8, but to avoid collision, I must be on y<=2 or y=9, but y=9 impossible, so must be on y<=2 at T=11.\n\nSimilarly, at T=12, must be on y<=2 or y=9.\n\nNow, y<=2 means y=0,1,2.\n\nAll are safe at T=11 and T=12, since only y=1,2 dangerous at T=6.\n\nSo I need to be at y<=2 at T=11.\n\nThen, from there, I can go up to y=9 later.\n\nBut that might take more turns.\n\nFirst, I need to get to y<=2 by T=11.\n\nFrom y=3 at T=6, with actions from t=6 to t=10.\n\ny11 = y6 + sum_{t=6 to 10} Δy_t = 3 + sum of 5 Δy's.\n\nEach Δy in {-1,0,1}\n\nTo have y11 <=2, since y6=3, need the sum of Δy from t=6 to t=10 to be <= -1.\n\nThat is, at least one down move or stay, but since we start at 3, to be <=2, we need net decrease.\n\nFor example, if I do one down and four stays, y11=2.\n\nOr one down, one stay, three up, etc., but need the sum <= -1.\n\nThen, after that, I need to go to y=9.\n\nBut y=9 is 7 steps up from y=2, or 9 from y=0, etc.\n\nNow, the minimal H.\n\nFirst, let's see how to be at y<=2 at T=11.\n\nEarliest I can be at y<=2.\n\nFor example, at T=6, y=3.\n\nIf I do D at t=6, then y7=2.\n\nBut T=7 is not critical.\n\nI need to be at low y at T=11.\n\nSince T=11 is fixed, I need to arrive at low y at that turn.\n\nI can choose to go down early or late.\n\nBut to minimize time, I should go down as late as possible or something.\n\nFirst, I need to reach y=9 eventually.\n\nThe critical point is T=11 and 12.\n\nI must not be on y=3-8 at T=11 and T=12.\n\nSince I have to be on some y, I must be on y=0,1,2,9 at those turns.\n\nBut y=9 not reachable by T=11, so must be on y=0,1,2 at T=11.\n\nSimilarly for T=12, but if I am on y<=2 at T=11, I can stay or move, but need to avoid being on y=3-8 at T=12.\n\nNow, let's plan the actions.\n\nFirst, from T=6 to T=10, I need to control where I am.\n\nAt T=11, I must have y11 <=2.\n\ny11 depends on actions from t=6 to t=10.\n\ny11 = 3 + Δy6 + Δy7 + Δy8 + Δy9 + Δy10\n\nSet S = Δy6 + ... + Δy10\n\nS <= -1 to have y11 <=2.\n\nS can be from -5 to +5.\n\ny11 = 3 + S, so for y11 <=2, 3+S <=2, so S <= -1.\n\nSimilarly, y11 >=0.\n\nAfter T=11, I need to go to y=9.\n\nNow, at T=11, if y11 <=2, safe.\n\nThen I need to reach y=9.\n\nThe distance to y=9 is 9 - y11.\n\nSince y11 <=2, distance at least 7.\n\nEach up move takes one turn.\n\nNow, also, at T=12, I need to be safe, so if at T=11 I am on y<=2, I can choose to stay, move up, or move down, but moving down might not help.\n\nAt T=12, I also need to be on y<=2 or y=9.\n\nBut if at T=11 I am on y=2, I can go up to y=3 at T=12, but y=3 is dangerous at T=12, since occupied.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=1 or something.\n\nTo be safe at T=12, if I am on y<=2 at T=11, I can:\n\n- Stay on same y, so at T=12, still y<=2, safe.\n\n- Move up to y+1, but if y+1 <=2, then y<=1, so if y=0 or1, move up to y=1 or2, still <=2, safe.\n\nIf at y=2, move up to y=3, but at T=12, y=3 occupied, collision.\n\n- Move down, to y-1, which could be lower, still <=2 if y<=2 and down, y-1<=1<=2, safe.\n\nSo to avoid collision at T=12, if at T=11 I am on y<=2, I should not move up if y=2, because I would go to y=3 at T=12, dangerous.\n\nI can stay or move down.\n\nBut I need to go up eventually.\n\nSimilarly, if I am on y=1 or 0, I can move up safely.\n\nNow, back to minimizing H.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn T.\n\nLet T_reach be the turn when I reach y=9.\n\nAt that turn, y_T_reach =9.\n\nBefore that, I need to be safe at all turns.\n\nThe constraining turns are T=11 and 12.\n\nTo minimize T_reach.\n\nSince I have to be low at T=11, T_reach cannot be before T=11, because I can't reach y=9 by T=10 or earlier? Earliest possible T_reach.\n\nFrom T=6 y=3, with all up: after 6 up moves, at T=12 y=9, but at T=11 y=8 collision.\n\nIf I go all up, I arrive at T=12 y=9, but collision at T=11.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nNext, if I go to y<=2 at T=11, then from there go up to y=9.\n\nHow many turns to go from y=3 to y<=2 at T=11.\n\ny11 <=2.\n\nWith actions from t=6 to t=10, 5 actions.\n\ny11 = 3 + S, S = sum Δy t=6 to10.\n\nS <= -1.\n\nTo minimize time to reach y=9, I should minimize the time spent going down, so I should go down as little as possible, but to have S <= -1, I need at least one net down.\n\nFor example, I can do four up and one down, but S = sum, if I do four U and one D, S = 4*(+1) + (-1) = +3, so y11=3+3=6, which is >2, not <=2.\n\nTo have S <= -1, I need more down than up, or stays.\n\nFor example, if I do one down and four stays, S = -1 +0+0+0+0 = -1, y11=3-1=2.\n\nIf I do two down and three stays, S=-2, y11=1, etc.\n\nOr one down, one up, three stays, S= -1+1+0+0+0=0, y11=3, not <=2.\n\ny11=3, which is dangerous at T=11.\n\nSo to have y11 <=2, S <= -1.\n\nMinimal |S| to achieve S<= -1 is S= -1, with y11=2.\n\nI can achieve that with, for example, one down move and four stay moves in the five actions.\n\nOr, one down, one up, and three stays, but S= -1+1+0+0+0=0, y11=3, not <=2.\n\nSo I need at least one down and no up, or more down.\n\nFor S= -1: possible with one down and four stays.\n\nOr three downs, one up, one stay, S= -3+1+0= -2, etc., but S= -2 is worse, y lower, takes more to go up.\n\nSo best to have S= -1, y11=2.\n\nWith one down and four stays.\n\nNow, the down move can be at any of the five turns.\n\nSimilarly, the stays.\n\nNow, at T=11, y=2, safe.\n\nThen I need to go from y=2 to y=9, which requires 7 up moves.\n\nAfter a11, y12, etc.\n\nLet me define the turns.\n\nAt T=11, y=2.\n\nThen I choose actions to go up.\n\nBut at T=12, I need to be safe.\n\nAt T=12, if I am still on y=2, safe.\n\nOr if I move up to y=3, but y=3 occupied at T=12, collision.\n\nSo I cannot move up from y=2 at T=11, because a11=U would set y12=3, and at T=12, on y=3, occupied, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay, a11=S, y12=2, safe.\n\nOr move down, a11=D, y12=1, safe.\n\nBut I need to go up.\n\nSo at T=11, since I am at y=2, I should not move up to avoid T=12 collision.\n\nI can stay or move down, but moving down is worse.\n\nSo best to stay at T=11, so at T=12, y=2, safe.\n\nThen at T=12, I can start moving up.\n\nBut T=12 is still critical, but if I am on y=2, safe.\n\nThen after T=12, I can move up freely, since no more dangerous times.\n\nAfter T=12, for T>=13, all freeways are safe, because occupation only at T=11 and 12.\n\nFor example, at T=13, for y=3, the car that was at k=5,6, T=11,12, at T=13, k=7, span for first car on y=3: [-41+6*7, -30+6*7] = [-41+42, -30+42] = [1,12], which does not include 0, similarly others, so safe.\n\nSimilarly for all y, after T=12, no occupation at 0.\n\nSo after T=12, I can move up without problem.\n\nNow, back to the plan.\n\nSo to have y11=2, with one down and four stays in actions t=6 to t=10.\n\ny11=2.\n\nAt T=11, I do S (stay), so y12=2.\n\nAt T=12, y=2, safe.\n\nThen from T=12 onwards, I need to go to y=9.\n\nAt T=12, y=2.\n\nI can start moving up.\n\nAfter a12=U, y13=3\n\na13=U, y14=4\n\n...\n\nup to y=9.\n\nFrom y=2 to y=9, 7 up moves.\n\nAfter a12=U, T=13 y=3\n\na13=U, T=14 y=4\n\na14=U, T=15 y=5\n\na15=U, T=16 y=6\n\na16=U, T=17 y=7\n\na17=U, T=18 y=8\n\na18=U, T=19 y=9\n\nSo at T=19, y=9.\n\nNow, check if all turns are safe.\n\nT=6: y=3, safe (not 11 or 12)\n\nT=7: depending on actions, but in this case, during t=6 to10, I have one down and four stays, so y at T=7 to T=10 could be 3 or 2 or something, but since not T=11 or 12, all safe, as only dangerous at T=11,12 for y=3-8.\n\nFor example, suppose at t=6 I do D, then y7=2\n\nT=7: y=2, which is safe, since y=2 only dangerous at T=6, past.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay at some point, y=3 or 2, safe except at T=11,12 but not those turns.\n\nT=7 to T=10 are not 11 or 12, so all y are safe at those times.\n\nT=11: y=2, safe\n\nT=12: y=2, safe\n\nThen T=13 to T=18: y from 3 to 8, but T=13 to 18 >12, so no occupation, safe.\n\nT=19: y=9, safe.\n\nSo this works, but H is large, from t=6 to t=18? Let's see the turns.\n\nActions from t=6 to t=18, I think.\n\nStart at t_1=6.\n\nActions: a6 to a18, that's 13 actions? Let's count.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=6 to t=18 inclusive? t=6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18: that's 13 turns.\n\nAt turn t, after action, position at t+1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position is set.\n\nWe want at turn t_1 + H - 1? Earlier I had confusion.\n\nIn the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H - 1\"\n\nLet's read:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nAnd at each turn, no collision.\n\nt_1=6.\n\nSo actions for t from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, i.e., actions at turn 6,7, ..., up to 6 + H - 1.\n\nThen at turn (t_1 + H - 1), position is 9.\n\nThe actions are applied from turn t_1 to t_1 + H - 1.\n\nAfter action at turn t, position at turn t+1.\n\nSo at turn t_1 + H - 1, after action, position at turn (t_1 + H - 1) + 1 = t_1 + H.\n\nBut we want at turn t_1 + H - 1, position to be 9.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nStandard: at turn t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nWe want at some turn T, y_T =9.\n\nAnd T = t_1 + H - 1.\n\nFor example, if H=1, actions at t= t_1 only, then after a_t1, y_{t1+1} is set, and we want y_{t1+1} =9? But at turn t1, y_t1 is current, not necessarily 9.\n\nThe position at turn t1 + H - 1 should be 9.\n\nSo at turn T = t1 + H - 1, y_T =9.\n\nAnd actions from t=t1 to t=t1 + H - 2? Let's see.\n\nActions a_t for t = t1 to t1 + H - 2 determine the moves to reach y_{t1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=t1 to t=t1 + H - 2, that's H-1 actions? Messy.\n\nBetter to think: to be at position at turn T, it is determined by actions from start to T-1.\n\nStart at turn t1, y_t1 given.\n\nTo have y_T =9 for some T, we need to apply actions from t=t1 to t=T-1, that is T - t1 actions.\n\nThen after T - t1 actions, we are at turn T with y_T=9.\n\nAnd T = t1 + H - 1? From the problem.\n\nH is the number of turns, meaning the sequence has H actions, from t=0 to H-1 offset, but with t1.\n\nSet τ = t - t1, so relative turn.\n\nAt relative turn 0, turn t1, position y.\n\nActions a_{t1 + τ} for τ=0 to H-1.\n\nThen at turn t1 + H - 1, position should be 9.\n\nFor τ from 0 to H-1, action at turn t1 + τ.\n\nAfter action at turn t1 + τ, position at turn t1 + τ +1.\n\nAt turn t1 + H - 1, after action, position at (t1 + H - 1) +1 = t1 + H.\n\nBut we want position at turn t1 + H - 1 to be 9.\n\nSo at turn t1 + H - 1, before action, y_{t1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nThen we don't need to act, but the action sequence includes up to that turn or not.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so actions at turns t1 to t1 + H - 1.\n\nAt turn t1 + H - 1, we perform action a_{t1 + H - 1}, which sets y_{t1 + H}, but we want y_{t1 + H - 1} =9 before action.\n\nSo the position at turn t1 + H - 1 must be 9 before the action is taken at that turn.\n\nIn other words, for the last turn, we are already at position, and we may not need to move, but the action is still taken.\n\nBut if we are at 9, we can stay.\n\nIn the sequence, actions include all from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nFor the position to be 9 at turn t1 + H - 1, it means that after the actions up to t1 + H - 2, we are at 9 at turn t1 + H - 1.\n\nThen at turn t1 + H - 1, we can do S or something.\n\nBut the key is that at turn t1 + H - 1, position is 9.\n\nActions from t=t1 to t=t1 + H - 2 are used to reach y_{t1 + H - 1} =9.\n\nAction at t=t1 + H - 1 is also performed, but since position is already 9, it might be S or whatever, but it doesn't change position if S.\n\nTo minimize H, we need to reach as early as possible.\n\nBack to our case.\n\nt1=6.\n\nI want to reach y=9 at some turn T.\n\nT must be at least 6 + 6 =12, since from y=3, 6 steps up, earliest at T=12.\n\nAt T=12, y=12, but with collision at T=11 if I go directly.\n\nIn our earlier plan, we had to go down to y=2 at T=11, then up, reaching at T=19, which is late.\n\nBut perhaps I can reach earlier.\n\nSince the dangerous times are only T=11 and 12, and I have to be off the middle freeways at those times, but I can be on y=9 at T=11 or later.\n\nBut I can't reach y=9 by T=11.\n\nAnother idea: I can be on y=0 at T=11, for example, then go up.\n\nBut y=0 is farther.\n\nWorse.\n\nOr, I can pass through the dangerous zones quickly when it's safe.\n\nFor example, from T=6 to T=10, I can be on y=3 to y=8, all safe, since not T=11 or 12.\n\nThen at T=11, I need to be on y<=2 or 9, but 9 impossible, so y<=2.\n\nThen at T=12, similarly.\n\nBut if at T=11 I am on y=2, and I stay, on y=2 at T=12, safe.\n\nThen after T=12, I can go up to y=9 in 7 turns, as before.\n\nBut can I start going up before T=12?\n\nFor example, at T=10, I could be at high y, but at T=11 I need to be low.\n\nLet's see the positions.\n\nSuppose at T=10, I want to be at some y, so that at T=11 I can be low.\n\nBut at T=11, y11 is determined by y10 and a10.\n\ny11 = y10 + Δy10.\n\nTo have y11 <=2, and y10 could be high.\n\nFor example, at T=10, if I am at y=3, I can do D, then y11=2.\n\nSimilarly, if at y=4, I can do D, y11=3, but y11=3 is not <=2, and dangerous.\n\nTo have y11<=2, if at T=10 y10=2, then I can do S or D, y11=2 or 1.\n\nIf y10=3, do D, y11=2.\n\nIf y10=4, do D, y11=3, which is bad.\n\nSo to have y11<=2, I need y10 <=3, and if y10=3, must do D; if y10=2, can do S or D; if y10=1 or 0, can do U, S, D to stay low or go lower.\n\nBut since I want to go up eventually, better to be high at T=10.\n\nMax y at T=10.\n\nFrom start, at T=6 y=3.\n\nWith 4 actions: t=6,7,8,9 to set y10.\n\ny10 = y6 + Δy6 + Δy7 + Δy8 + Δy9 = 3 + sum of 4 Δy's.\n\nMax y10 = 3 +4 =7, if all U.\n\nThen at T=10, y=7.\n\nThen to have y11<=2, I need to go down, but y11 = y10 + Δy10 <=2.\n\nIf y10=7, Δy10 >= -1, so y11 >=6, which is >2, cannot be <=2.\n\nIf y10=6, y11>=5>2.\n\nSimilarly, only if y10<=3, I can have y11<=2.\n\nSpecifically, if y10=3, do D, y11=2.\n\nIf y10=2, do S, y11=2 or D y11=1.\n\nIf y10=1, do S y11=1 or U y11=2 or D y11=0.\n\nEtc.\n\nBut y10<=3.\n\nWith actions from t=6 to t=9, 4 actions, to set y10.\n\ny10 = 3 + Δy6 + Δy7 + Δy8 + Δy9\n\nTo have y10 <=3, so the sum of 4 Δy's <=0.\n\nThat is, I cannot have net increase.\n\nFor example, if I do all S, y10=3.\n\nOr one D, three S, y10=2, etc.\n\nBut to be able to go up later, I should not go down too much.\n\nSo best to have y10=3, with all stay from t=6 to t=9.\n\nThen at T=10, y=3.\n\nThen a10=D, so y11=2.\n\nThen at T=11, y=2, safe.\n\nThen a11=S, so y12=2 (stay to avoid moving to y=3 at T=12)\n\nThen from T=12, go up.\n\nAt T=12, y=2.\n\na12=U, y13=3\n\na13=U, y14=4\n\na14=U, y15=5\n\na15=U, y16=6\n\na16=U, y17=7\n\na17=U, y18=8\n\na18=U, y19=9\n\nAt T=19, y=9.\n\nNow, to reach at turn t1 + H -1 =19.\n\nt1=6, so 6 + H -1 =19, so H-1=13, H=14.\n\nActions from t=6 to t=19? Let's see.\n\nPosition at turn T=19 should be 9.\n\nT= t1 + H -1 =19, t1=6, so 6 + H -1 =19, thus H-1=13, H=14.\n\nActions from τ=0 to 13, t=6 to 19? t from t1 to t1 + H -1 =6 to 6+13=19, actions at 14 turns: t=6 to 19 inclusive.\n\nBut at turn t=19, we do action, but position at t=19 is 9 before action.\n\nIn the sequence, actions at t=6 to t=18 determine y at t=7 to t=19.\n\nAt turn t=19, y=9.\n\nThen we perform a19, but it doesn't matter.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions up to t=18 are needed to reach y=9 at t=19.\n\nLet's list the actions for this plan:\n\nFrom t=6 to t=9: all S, so y stays at 3.\n\nT=6: y=3, safe\n\na6=S, y7=3\n\nT=7: y=3, safe\n\na7=S, y8=3\n\nT=8: y=3, safe\n\na8=S, y9=3\n\nT=9: y=3, safe\n\na9=S, y10=3\n\nT=10: y=3, safe\n\na10=D, so y11=2\n\nT=11: y=2, safe\n\na11=S, y12=2\n\nT=12: y=2, safe\n\na12=U, y13=3\n\nT=13: y=3, safe (T=13>12)\n\na13=U, y14=4\n\nT=14: y=4, safe\n\na14=U, y15=5\n\nT=15: y=5, safe\n\na15=U, y16=6\n\nT=16: y=6, safe\n\na16=U, y17=7\n\nT=17: y=7, safe\n\na17=U, y18=8\n\nT=18: y=8, safe\n\na18=U, y19=9\n\nAt T=19, y=9.\n\nWe reached at T=19.\n\nBut H=14? t1 + H -1 =19, t1=6, so 6 + H -1 =19, H-1=13, H=14.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=6 to t=18, that's 13 actions to reach y at t=19.\n\nActions at t=6 to t=18, 13 actions, H=14 turns? I'm confused with indexing.\n\nAccording to problem: actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1}\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so H actions.\n\nThen at turn t1 + H -1, position is 9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, action at t1, then at turn t1, before action, position should be 9? But not necessarily.\n\nAt turn t1 + H -1, position is 9.\n\nWith actions from t1 to t1 + H -2, we set y_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nAction at t1 + H -1 is also performed, but since position is already 9, it might be redundant.\n\nTo reach y=9 at T=19, with t1=6, T=19= t1 +13, so t1 + H -1 =19, 6 + H -1 =19, H-1=13, H=14.\n\nActions at t=6,7,8,..., up to t=6+13=19? t from 0 to 13 for relative, so t=6 to 19, 14 actions.\n\nBut the last action at t=19 is after position is reached.\n\nIn the sequence, for t=19, a19 can be S, but y at t=19 is 9 before a19.\n\nPerhaps it's fine.\n\nBut we can save one turn.\n\nIn this plan, I stayed from t=6 to t=9, but I could have gone up during t=6 to t=10, but at T=11 I need to be low.\n\nFor example, suppose from t=6 to t=9, I go up as much as possible, but y10 must be <=3 to allow y11<=2.\n\ny10 <=3.\n\nWith 4 actions from t=6 to t=9, max y10=7 if all U, but we need y10<=3, so I cannot go up; I have to stay or go down to keep y10<=3.\n\nFor example, if I do all S, y10=3.\n\nOr if I do one U, then I need one D to compensate, but y10=3 +1 -1 +0+0=3, for example.\n\nBut then at T=10, y=3, same as before.\n\nThen a10=D, y11=2.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf I go down earlier, I might reach lower, but then need more up moves.\n\nFor example, at t=6, do D, y7=2.\n\nThen I can go up from there, but at T=11 I need to be <=2, so I might be at y=2 or less.\n\nBut from y=2, to y=9, 7 up, same as before.\n\nBut let's see the timing.\n\nStart T=6 y=3\n\na6=D, y7=2\n\nT=7 y=2, safe\n\na7=U, y8=3\n\nT=8 y=3, safe\n\na8=U, y9=4\n\nT=9 y=4, safe\n\na9=D, y10=3  // to have y10=3\n\nT=10 y=3, safe\n\na10=D, y11=2\n\nT=11 y=2, safe\n\na11=S, y12=2\n\nT=12 y=2, safe\n\nThen a12=U, y13=3\n\n... up to a18=U, y19=9 same as before.\n\nStill T=19.\n\nIf at T=10 I am at y=3, a10=D to y11=2.\n\nBut I could be at y=2 at T=10, then at T=10, a10=S, y11=2.\n\nBut to be at y=2 at T=10, I need to go down earlier.\n\nFor example, a6=D, y7=2, then from T=7 to T=9, I can stay or move, but at T=10, y=2, then a10=S, y11=2.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nNo gain.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 at T=12 if I can avoid collision at T=11.\n\nBut at T=11, if I am not on y=3-8, but on y=9, impossible.\n\nOr on y=0,1,2.\n\nBut if I am on y=2 at T=11, I can go to y=3 at T=12, but at T=12, y=3 occupied, collision.\n\nIf I go to y=9 from y=2 at T=11, but from y=2 to y=9, min 7 turns, so at T=18 or later.\n\nNot by T=12.\n\nAnother idea: since at T=11 and 12, the freeways are occupied, but I can be on the same freeway at other times.\n\nBut I have to be there when not occupied.\n\nBut the problem is that at T=11 and 12, I must not be on them.\n\nSo I need to be on y=9 before T=11 or after T=12, but after T=12 I can be.\n\nBut before T=11, I can't reach.\n\nT=11 is turn 11, from T=6, only 5 turns to T=10, can reach at most y=8.\n\nAt T=10, y=8, safe, but at T=11, if I go to y=9, a10=U, from y=8? At T=10, if y=8, a10=U, then y11=9.\n\nAt T=11, y=9, which is safe, no cars.\n\nThen I reach at T=11.\n\nBut can I reach y=8 at T=10?\n\nFrom y=3 at T=6, to y=8 at T=10, need +5 in 4 actions: t=6 to t=9.\n\ny10 = y6 + Δy6 + Δy7 + Δy8 + Δy9 = 3 + sum 4 Δy.\n\nTo have y10=8, need sum = +5, but max per action +1, so max y10=7, cannot reach 8.\n\nMax at T=10 is y=7, with all U: a6=U, y7=4; a7=U, y8=5; a8=U, y9=6; a9=U, y10=7.\n\nAt T=10, y=7, safe.\n\nThen a10=U, y11=8.\n\nBut at T=11, y=8, which is occupied, collision.\n\nIf I do not go up at a10, but something else.\n\nBut I want to reach y=9.\n\nAt T=10, y=7, if I do U, to y=8 at T=11, collision.\n\nIf I do S, y11=7, at T=11, y=7 occupied, collision.\n\nIf I do D, y11=6, occupied, collision.\n\nSo whatever I do, at T=11, if I am on y=7, it is occupied, collision.\n\nSimilarly for any y from 3 to 8 at T=11, collision.\n\nSo the only way is to not be on y=3-8 at T=11 and T=12.\n\nThus, the earlier plan is necessary.\n\nBut perhaps I can reach y=9 faster by going down less.\n\nIn the first plan, I used 5 turns to go from y=3 to y=2 at T=11 with one down and four stays, but I could use some up moves during safe times and down only when needed.\n\nFor example, from T=6 to T=9, I can go up to y=7 at T=10, but then at T=10, I need to go down to low y for T=11, but from y=7, I can only go to y=6 at T=11, which is dangerous.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSuppose I go down immediately to y=0 or something, but that takes more down moves, then more up moves, worse.\n\nSo the minimal H is with the plan where I stay at y=3 until T=10, then down to y=2 at T=11, stay at T=11, then from T=12 up to y=9 at T=19.\n\nH=14.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can reach earlier by being on y=1 or 0 at T=11.\n\nFor example, if I go to y=1 at T=11, then from there to y=9, 8 up moves, reach at T=19 or later, worse.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=9 at T=12.\n\nTo reach y=9 at T=12, from y=3 at T=6, need +6 in 6 actions: t=6 to t=11.\n\nBut with all U, at T=12 y=9, but at T=11 y=8 collision.\n\nAnd I cannot avoid that because to reach y=9 at T=12, I must be at y=8 at T=11, which is collision.\n\nIf I am at y=8 at T=10, then a10=S, y11=8, collision at T=11.\n\na10=U, y11=9, but from y=8 at T=10, a10=U, y11=9.\n\nBut can I be at y=8 at T=10?\n\nFrom y=3 at T=6, to y=8 at T=10, need +5 in 4 actions, impossible, max y=7 at T=10.\n\nSo no way to reach before T=19 except if I can be on safe low y at critical times with less delay.\n\nAnother thought: at T=12, if I am on y=2, I can go up to y=3 at T=13, which is safe, since T=13>12.\n\nBut at T=12, I need to be safe, so if on y=2, I can go up, a12=U, then y13=3, at T=13 y=3, safe.\n\nThen I can reach y=9 faster.\n\nIn the earlier plan, at T=12, I did S to stay on y=2, but I can move up.\n\nLet's see.\n\nFrom previous: at T=11, y=2.\n\nThen a11=U, so y12=3.\n\nBut at T=12, y=3, which is occupied, collision.\n\nCannot.\n\na11=S, y12=2, safe at T=12.\n\nThen a12=U, y13=3, at T=13 y=3, safe.\n\nThen I can go up.\n\nSo from T=13 y=3, to T=19 y=9, 6 up moves, but T=13 to T=19 is 7 turns? Positions:\n\nT=13 y=3\n\na13=U, y14=4\n\nT=14 y=4\n\na14=U, y15=5\n\n...\n\nup to a18=U, y19=9\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf at T=11 y=2, I do a11=U, but collision at T=12.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo I think T=19 is the earliest.\n\nBut let's list the actions to minimize H.\n\nH is the number of turns in the sequence.\n\nTo reach at T=19, with t1=6, T= t1 + H -1 =19, so 6 + H -1 =19, H=14.\n\nActions at t=6 to t=19? t from 0 to 13 for relative, so 14 actions.\n\nBut the position is reached at turn 19 with actions up to t=18.\n\nPerhaps I can start going up earlier.\n\nFor example, instead of staying from t=6 to t=9, I can go up to y=6 at T=9, but then at T=10, I need to go down to y=3 or less to have y11=2.\n\nFor example:\n\nT=6 y=3, a6=U, y7=4\n\nT=7 y=4, a7=U, y8=5\n\nT=8 y=5, a8=U, y9=6\n\nT=9 y=6, a9=D, y10=5  // but I need y10 <=3 for y11<=2 easily\n\ny10=5, then to have y11<=2, need a10=D, y11=4, but y11=4 >2, and dangerous.\n\ny11=4 at T=11, occupied, collision.\n\nIf a10=D, y11=4.\n\nNot <=2.\n\nTo have y11<=2 from y10=5, impossible, since min y11=4 if a10=D.\n\nSo I must have y10 <=3.\n\nSo I cannot be above y=3 at T=10.\n\nThus, the only way is to keep y<=3 from T=6 to T=10, then down to y=2 at T=11, etc.\n\nSo minimal H is 14.\n\nBut let's confirm the answer format.\n\nPerhaps for the down move, I can do it later.\n\nFor example, at T=10, y=3, a10=D, y11=2.\n\nSame as before.\n\nOr, I can do the down at t=6, then go up to y=3 or something.\n\nBut still, from y=2 at T=7 to y=9, 7 moves, reach T=14? Let's calculate.\n\nSuppose:\n\nT=6 y=3, a6=D, y7=2\n\nThen from T=7, I can go up: a7=U, y8=3\n\na8=U, y9=4\n\na9=U, y10=5\n\nBut at T=10 y=5, then to have y11<=2, impossible, since y11 >=4 if a10=D.\n\ny11=4 or 5 or 6.\n\nAll dangerous at T=11.\n\nSo I need to be low at T=10.\n\nThus, I must keep y low from the beginning or stay.\n\nSo the first plan is optimal: stay at y=3 for turns t=6 to t=9 (4 turns), then at t=10 down to y=2 at T=11, then stay at t=11 to remain at y=2 for T=12, then up from t=12 to t=18 to reach y=9 at T=19.\n\nActions:\n\nt=6: S\n\nt=7: S\n\nt=8: S\n\nt=9: S\n\nt=10: D\n\nt=11: S\n\nt=12: U\n\nt=13: U\n\nt=14: U\n\nt=15: U\n\nt=16: U\n\nt=17: U\n\nt=18: U\n\nThen at T=19, y=9.\n\nNow, number of actions: from t=6 to t=18, that's 13 actions? t=6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18: 13 actions.\n\nBut for the sequence, {a_t for t=t1 to t1+H-1}, with H such that at turn t1+H-1, position is 9.\n\nHere position at T=19 is 9, t1=6, so t1+H-1=19, 6+H-1=19, H-1=13, H=14.\n\nSo actions from t=6 to t=19? But at t=19, action is not needed for reaching, but we have to include it.\n\nIn the sequence, for t=19, we can set a19=S or whatever.\n\nBut in the output, we need to list actions from t=6 to t=6+H-1.\n\nWith H=14, actions at t=6 to t=19.\n\nBut at t=19, position is already 9, so a19 can be S.\n\nIn the plan above, with actions up to t=18, we reach y=9 at t=19.\n\nSo for the sequence, actions at t=6 to t=18 are set, and at t=19, we can add a19=S.\n\nThen H=14 actions.\n\nTurn t=6 to t=19.\n\nIn the answer, list actions from t=6 to t=19.\n\nBut at t=19, it is after position is reached.\n\nTo save one action, but since we have to be at position at turn t1+H-1, and with actions, it's fine.\n\nPerhaps we can reach at turn 18.\n\nIs it possible to reach y=9 at T=18?\n\nFrom y=3 at T=6, to y=9 at T=18, need +6 in 12 turns? Actions from t=6 to t=17 determine y18.\n\ny18 = y6 + sum_{t=6 to 17} Δy_t\n\n12 actions, min 12 up moves, but y from 3 to 9, need +6, so possible with 6 up and 6 other.\n\nBut we have the constraint at T=11 and 12.\n\nAt T=11, must be y<=2.\n\nAt T=12, must be y<=2 or y=9.\n\nIf I can be at y=9 at T=12, but impossible as before.\n\nOr at T=12 y<=2.\n\nThen from there to y=9 at T=18, need +7 from y<=2, so at least 7 up moves, but from T=12 to T=17, 6 actions, max +6, so can reach y=8 at T=18 if start from y=2 at T=12.\n\ny at T=12, then actions to T=17, set y18.\n\nIf y12=2, then y18 = 2 + sum Δy t=12 to17, max 2+6=8, cannot reach 9.\n\nSo cannot reach y=9 at T=18.\n\nSimilarly, earliest at T=19.\n\nThus, minimal H=14.\n\nNow for the actions, in the list, we have to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the down move, I did at t=10, but I could do it earlier, but it doesn't change H.\n\nFor example, I could do down at t=6, but then I need to come back, same time.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn t=6: S\n\nTurn t=7: S\n\nTurn t=8: S\n\nTurn t=9: S\n\nTurn t=10: D\n\nTurn t=11: S\n\nTurn t=12: U\n\nTurn t=13: U\n\nTurn t=14: U\n\nTurn t=15: U\n\nTurn t=16: U\n\nTurn t=17: U\n\nTurn t=18: U\n\nThen at T=19 y=9.\n\nBut for the action at t=19, we need to include for H=14.\n\nSince at t=19 position is 9, we can set a19=S.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=6 to t=19.\n\nFor t=19: S\n\nBut it's redundant.\n\nNow, in the output, list for each turn.\n\nBut let's write the answer.\n\nFirst, minimal H=14.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 6: S\n\nTurn 7: S\n\nTurn 8: S\n\nTurn 9: S\n\nTurn 10: D\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: S  // since at position\n\nBut turn 19 is included.\n\nIn the sequence, turn t=6 to t=19.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's confirm the car states quickly.\n\nFor example, at T=10, y=3, which is safe, no issue.\n\nAt T=11, y=2, safe.\n\nT=12, y=2, safe.\n\nThen up to T=19 y=9.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps I can go up during the early turns when possible, but I need y10<=3.\n\nFor example, if I do a6=U, y7=4\n\nThen I need to go down later, but to have y10<=3, I need to decrease.\n\nFor instance, a6=U, y7=4\n\na7=D, y8=3\n\na8=S, y9=3\n\na9=S, y10=3\n\nThen a10=D, y11=2\n\na11=S, y12=2\n\nThen same as before, but I used one U and one D, which cancel, same position at T=10.\n\nThen the up moves from T=12, same.\n\nNo gain in time.\n\nThus, the sequence with all stay then down then up is fine.\n\nNow for the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) is 14. This sequence avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on any freeway from \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at turns \\(T = 11\\) and \\(T = 12\\), when collisions would occur due to car positions.\n\n- At turns \\(T = 11\\) and \\(T = 12\\), freeways \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 8\\) are occupied at position \\(x = 0\\), so the player must be on \\(y \\leq 2\\) or \\(y = 9\\) to avoid collision. Since \\(y = 9\\) cannot be reached by \\(T = 11\\) from \\(y = 3\\) at \\(T = 6\\) (minimum 6 up moves required, but only 5 actions from \\(T = 6\\) to \\(T = 10\\) can achieve at most \\(y = 8\\)), the player must be on \\(y \\leq 2\\) at \\(T = 11\\) and \\(T = 12\\).\n- To be at \\(y = 2\\) at \\(T = 11\\), the player stays at \\(y = 3\\) from turns \\(T = 6\\) to \\(T = 10\\) except for one down move. Specifically, from \\(T = 6\\) to \\(T = 9\\), the player stays (actions S), keeping \\(y = 3\\). At \\(T = 10\\), the player moves down (D) to reach \\(y = 2\\) at \\(T = 11\\).\n- At \\(T = 11\\), the player stays (S) to remain at \\(y = 2\\) for \\(T = 12\\), avoiding collision.\n- After \\(T = 12\\), all freeways are safe (no occupation at \\(x = 0\\) for \\(T \\geq 13\\)), so the player moves up (U) for 7 turns to reach \\(y = 9\\) at \\(T = 19\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions from turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) to turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 19\\) (14 turns) is:\n\n- Actions at turns 6 to 9: Stay (S) to maintain \\(y = 3\\), safe as \\(T \\neq 11, 12\\).\n- Action at turn 10: Down (D) to reach \\(y = 2\\) at \\(T = 11\\).\n- Action at turn 11: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 2\\) for \\(T = 12\\).\n- Actions at turns 12 to 18: Up (U) to increase \\(y\\) from 2 to 9 over 7 turns.\n- Action at turn 19: Stay (S), as position is already \\((0, 9)\\).\n\nThis sequence ensures:\n- No collision at any turn: \\(y_t \\leq 2\\) or safe at critical turns \\(T = 11\\) and \\(T = 12\\), and all other turns are safe.\n- Minimal \\(H = 14\\): Reaching \\(y = 9\\) at \\(T = 19\\) is the earliest possible given the constraints.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 6: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: S \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 8, and the player is at (0,3). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to 8).\n\nThe car update rules:\n- Left-moving: span moves left (decreasing x) at speed s per turn.\n- Right-moving: span moves right (increasing x) at speed s per turn.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway y (which must be between 1 and 8) and the x-coordinate 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at that same turn T.\n\nImportant note: when moving vertically at turn T, the player is only considered to be on the freeway of the starting y at that turn. For example, if at turn T the player is at y and moves to y+1, then at turn T the player is on freeway y (if y is between 1 and 8) and at turn T+1 the player will be on freeway y+1.\n\nWe are to output a sequence of actions starting at turn t1 (turn 8) until we reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H is the minimal number of actions (turns) to go from y=3 to y=9 without colliding. The minimal vertical moves would be 6 steps upward (if we could go straight up). But we have to avoid collisions on freeways 3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nWe are at turn 8, and we are at y=3. We are going to simulate each turn.\n\nFirst, let's note the car configurations for each freeway at the current turn (t1=8). The cars are given at turn 8.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway and for each future turn T (>=8) the set of x-coordinates that are occupied by cars on that freeway at turn T.\n\nBut note: collision only happens if at turn T the player is on freeway k (i.e., y_T = k) and the car span on freeway k at turn T contains 0.\n\nSo we need to check for each freeway k (from 1 to 8) and for each turn T whether the point 0 is covered by any car on freeway k at turn T.\n\nLet's define the car spans at turn T for a car that was at turn 8 (t1) with [head, tail] and direction and speed.\n\nFor a left-moving car (d = left):\n  At turn T, the span is [h - s*(T-8), tau - s*(T-8)]\nBut note: the given head and tail at turn 8. For left-moving, the head is the rightmost? Actually, the problem says:\n  Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\nBut note: if the car is moving left, then the head (which was at h at turn 8) will be at h - s*(T-8) at turn T, and the tail at tau - s*(T-8). Since the car is moving left, the entire span shifts left.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: [tau, head] -> [tau + s*(T-8), head + s*(T-8)]? Actually, the problem says for right-moving: \n  [Span(t1) = [tau, head] -> becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]\nBut note: the representation for right-moving is given as (head, tail) but in the table it's written as (h, tau) and then direction. So we must interpret the given (h, tau) for right-moving as: the head is the rightmost? Actually, the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, head]\" meaning that the tail is at tau and the head at head? But then it says the car moves right, so the entire span shifts right.\n\nHowever, looking at the table for freeway 3,4,5,6,7,8, we see cars with negative numbers and positive. Let's interpret the given data.\n\nFor freeway 1: one car: (48, 83, left, 36)\n  This is left-moving. At turn 8: span is [48, 83]. But 48 < 83? Then as it moves left, the numbers decrease.\n\nBut note: the problem says for left-moving: [h, tau] -> [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\nIf h=48 and tau=83, then the span at turn 8 is [48,83]. But that would be a car of length 35 (from 48 to 83) and moving left. Then at turn T, it becomes [48-36*(T-8), 83-36*(T-8)].\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 3: three cars: \n  (-18, -29, right, 6) -> for a right-moving car, the span at turn 8 is [tau, head] = [-29, -18] (because tail is -29 and head is -18). Then at turn T: [-29+6*(T-8), -18+6*(T-8)]\n  (60,49,right,6) -> this one: head=60, tail=49? Then the span at turn 8 is [49,60] (because tail is 49 and head is 60) -> [49+6*(T-8), 60+6*(T-8)]\n  (24,13,right,6) -> [13,24] -> [13+6*(T-8), 24+6*(T-8)]\n\nBut wait, for the car (60,49,right,6): the head is 60 and tail 49? Then the car is from 49 to 60? That's 12 units? But the problem says: for right-moving, the head is the front? So the car extends from the tail (49) to the head (60). Similarly, the car (-18,-29,right,6) is from -29 to -18? That's 11 units.\n\nNow, we are concerned with when the x-coordinate 0 is in the span of a car on the freeway we are on at a particular turn.\n\nWe are at y=3 at turn 8. We can move up, down, or stay. But our goal is to get to y=9 as fast as possible, so we want to move up when safe.\n\nWe need to simulate the path from turn 8 until we get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal H would be 6 if we could go straight up without any collision. Let's check:\n\nWe start at y=3 at turn 8.\n\nWe plan to go: U, U, U, U, U, U -> that would take 6 moves.\n\nBut we must check for each turn T (from 8 onward) and for the y we are on at that turn, whether there is a car on that freeway at turn T that covers x=0.\n\nAt turn 8: we are at y=3. So we check freeway 3 at turn 8.\n\nFreeway 3 has three cars:\n  car1: [-29, -18] at turn 8 -> does 0 lie in [-29, -18]? No.\n  car2: [49,60] -> no\n  car3: [13,24] -> no\n\nSo at turn 8, we are safe.\n\nNow, we take an action at turn 8. We want to move up, so a_{8}=U.\n\nThen at turn 9: we will be at y=4. But note: during turn 8, we were at y=3. Then we moved to y=4 at the end of the turn? Actually, the update is: at turn t, we are at y_t. Then we choose a_t, and then y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nSo at turn 9, we are at y=4.\n\nBut we must check at each turn the freeway we are on at that turn.\n\nAt turn 9: we are on freeway 4? Yes, because we are at y=4.\n\nCheck freeway 4 at turn 9:\n\nFreeway 4 has the same three cars as freeway 3? According to the table:\n  Freeway 4: same as freeway 3: (-18,-29,right,6) -> same as above: [-29, -18] at turn 8? Then at turn 9 (T=9, so T-8=1): \n      car1: [-29+6*1, -18+6*1] = [-23, -12] -> 0 is not in [-23,-12]\n      car2: [49+6,60+6] = [55,66] -> no\n      car3: [13+6,24+6] = [19,30] -> no\n\nSo safe at turn 9. Then we take U again: a_{9}=U.\n\nTurn 10: we are at y=5. Check freeway 5 at turn 10:\n\nFreeway 5 has only one car: (-18,-29,right,6) -> same as above: at turn 10 (T=10, T-8=2): \n      [-29+12, -18+12] = [-17, -6] -> 0 is not in [-17,-6] -> safe.\n\nThen a_{10}=U -> turn 11: y=6.\n\nCheck freeway 6 at turn 11: \n  Only car: (-18,-29,right,6) -> T=11, T-8=3: [-29+18, -18+18] = [-11, 0]. \n  Now, 0 is in [-11,0]? The span is [-11,0]. Since 0 is included? Yes. So if we are on freeway 6 at turn 11, we collide.\n\nBut wait, at turn 11 we are going to be at y=6? Then we are on freeway 6 at turn 11 -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=6 at turn 11.\n\nTherefore, the straight up path would collide at turn 11.\n\nWe need to adjust.\n\nWhat if we delay the move to y=6? Or maybe move down? But we want to go up.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to stay at a freeway for a turn to avoid the collision.\n\nWe are at turn 10: we are at y=5. At turn 10, we could choose to not go up but stay? Then at turn 11 we would be at y=5 (still) and then go up at turn 12.\n\nBut let's check:\n\nAt turn 10: we are at y=5 (safe as above). Then we choose S (stay) at turn 10.\n\nThen at turn 11: we are at y=5. Check freeway 5 at turn 11: \n  T=11, T-8=3: the car on freeway 5: [-29+6*3, -18+6*3] = [-29+18, -18+18] = [-11,0]. \n  Does 0 lie in [-11,0]? Yes. But wait, we are at freeway 5 at turn 11? The car is on freeway 5? Yes. So we collide.\n\nSo staying at y=5 at turn 11 is not safe.\n\nThen what about moving down at turn 10? That would put us at y=4 at turn 11.\n\nCheck freeway 4 at turn 11: \n  T=11, T-8=3: \n    car1: [-29+18, -18+18] = [-11,0] -> 0 is in this span? Yes.\n    car2: [49+18,60+18] = [67,78] -> no\n    car3: [13+18,24+18] = [31,42] -> no\n  So freeway 4 at turn 11 has a car covering 0. So if we are at y=4 at turn 11, we collide.\n\nSo both staying and moving down at turn 10 lead to collision at turn 11? Then what can we do?\n\nWe must avoid being on freeways 4,5,6 at turn 11? Because:\n\nFreeway 4 at turn 11: car1 covers 0.\nFreeway 5 at turn 11: car covers 0.\nFreeway 6 at turn 11: car covers 0.\n\nWhat about freeway 3 at turn 11?\n  Freeway 3: \n    car1: [-29+18, -18+18] = [-11,0] -> covers 0 -> unsafe.\n    car2: [49+18,60+18] = [67,78] -> safe\n    car3: [13+18,24+18] = [31,42] -> safe\n\nSo freeway 3 at turn 11 also has a car covering 0.\n\nFreeway 2 at turn 11?\n  Freeway 2: at turn 8: one car (48,83,left,36). Then at turn 11 (T=11, T-8=3): \n      [48 - 36*3, 83 - 36*3] = [48-108, 83-108] = [-60, -25] -> 0 not in [-60,-25] -> safe.\n\nFreeway 1 at turn 11?\n  Freeway 1: same car: [48-108,83-108] = [-60,-25] -> safe.\n\nFreeway 7 at turn 11?\n  Freeway 7: one car: (-18,-29,right,6) -> same as others: [-29+18, -18+18] = [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n\nFreeway 8 at turn 11?\n  Freeway 8: same car: [-29+18, -18+18] = [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n\nSo at turn 11, the safe freeways are only freeways 1 and 2.\n\nTherefore, at turn 11 we must be at either y=1 or y=2 to avoid collision.\n\nBut we are at turn 10: we are at y=5. We need to get to y=1 or y=2 at turn 11? That means we must move down at least 3 steps in one turn? But we can only move one step per turn.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=1 or y=2 at turn 11 starting from y=5 at turn 10.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being on any freeway (from 1 to 8) at turn 11? But we have to be on one of them unless we are at y=0 or y=9. However, we are at y=5 at turn 10 and we cannot jump to y=0 or y=9 in one move.\n\nAt turn 10, we are at y=5. We can only go to y=4,5,6 at turn 11. But all of these freeways (4,5,6) are unsafe at turn 11.\n\nSo we have a problem: we cannot be at any of the freeways 3,4,5,6,7,8 at turn 11? But we are forced to be in one of them if we are at y between 1 and 8.\n\nTherefore, we must not be on any freeway at turn 11? That means we must be at y=0 or y=9 at turn 11.\n\nBut we are at y=5 at turn 10. We can only get to y=4,5,6 at turn 11. None of which are 0 or 9.\n\nSo we must avoid being at turn 11? That is, we must have reached y=9 by turn 10? But we started at turn 8 at y=3. To get to y=9 by turn 10, we would need to go up 6 steps in 2 turns: that's impossible (max we can do is 2 steps: two U moves: 3->4->5 at turn 9, then 5->6 at turn 10).\n\nSo we cannot be at y=9 by turn 10.\n\nTherefore, we must not be on the grid at freeways 1-8 at turn 11? But we have to be. So we must avoid turn 11? That is, we must have finished earlier? But we started at turn 8 and we need at least 6 moves to go from 3 to 9.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to be at y=0 at turn 11? But that would require going down from 5 to 0 in one turn? Impossible.\n\nSo what can we do? We must have a path that avoids being on the unsafe freeways at turn 11.\n\nBut we see that the problem at turn 11 is that freeways 3,4,5,6,7,8 are all unsafe. And we cannot get to freeways 1 or 2 from y=5 in one move.\n\nTherefore, we must be at a freeway that is safe at turn 11. But the only safe ones are 1 and 2. So we need to be at y=1 or 2 at turn 11.\n\nBut we are at turn 8 at y=3. How to get to y=1 or 2 by turn 11? That's 3 turns: turn8, turn9, turn10, and then at turn11 we are at y=1 or 2.\n\nSo we have to move down.\n\nBut moving down means we are getting away from the goal (9). Then we have to come back up.\n\nLet's plan:\n\nAt turn8: we are at y=3. We want to go down to y=1 or 2 by turn11.\n\nOption 1: go down to y=2 at turn11.\n\nSteps:\n  turn8: at y=3. We can choose D: then turn9: y=2.\n  Then at turn9: we are at y=2. Then we can stay or move? But we need to be at y=2 at turn11? Or we can be at y=1 at turn11? But we need to avoid being at freeways 3-8 at turn11.\n\nBut at turn9: we are at y=2. Then at turn10: we can choose to stay at y=2? Then at turn11: we are at y=2 -> safe (freeway2 is safe at turn11).\n\nSo:\n  turn8: D -> y=4? No: D would be from 3 to 2? \n      Actually: D: y_{t+1} = y_t - 1 -> so from 3 to 2.\n\n  Then turn8: action D -> at turn9: y=2.\n\n  Then at turn9: we are at freeway2. Check freeway2 at turn9:\n      T=9, T-8=1: freeway2 car: [48-36*1, 83-36*1] = [12,47] -> 0 not in [12,47] -> safe.\n\n  Then at turn9: we choose S (stay) -> turn10: y=2.\n\n  Then at turn10: we are at freeway2. Check freeway2 at turn10:\n      T=10, T-8=2: [48-72, 83-72] = [-24, 11] -> 0 is in [-24,11]? Yes! So unsafe.\n\nOh no! So at turn10, freeway2 becomes unsafe? \n\nWe must check freeway2 at turn10: \n  The car: [48 - 36*(10-8), 83 - 36*(10-8)] = [48-72, 83-72] = [-24,11]. \n  Since 0 is between -24 and 11, we have a collision.\n\nSo we cannot stay at y=2 at turn10.\n\nThen at turn9 (at y=2) we must move? We can move up or down.\n\nIf we move down at turn9: then at turn10: y=1.\n\nCheck freeway1 at turn10:\n  T=10, T-8=2: freeway1 car: [48-72,83-72] = [-24,11] -> 0 is in this span -> unsafe.\n\nSo moving down to y=1 at turn10 is unsafe.\n\nThen move up at turn9? From y=2 to y=3 at turn10.\n\nCheck freeway3 at turn10:\n  T=10, T-8=2: \n    car1: [-29+12, -18+12] = [-17,-6] -> safe.\n    car2: [49+12,60+12] = [61,72] -> safe.\n    car3: [13+12,24+12] = [25,36] -> safe.\n  So freeway3 at turn10 is safe.\n\nThen at turn10: we are at y=3 (safe). Then at turn11: we must avoid being on freeways 3-8? So we need to be at y=1 or 2 at turn11.\n\nFrom y=3 at turn10, we can move down to y=2 at turn11? Then check freeway2 at turn11.\n\nFreeway2 at turn11: T=11, T-8=3: [48-108,83-108] = [-60,-25] -> 0 not in [-60,-25] -> safe.\n\nSo that works.\n\nSo the plan for the first few turns:\n\nturn8: start at y=3 -> we choose D (to get down to y=2 at turn9)\nturn9: at y=2 -> we choose U? But wait, we want to be at y=3 at turn10? Then at turn9 we choose U -> then at turn10: y=3.\nturn10: at y=3 -> we choose D? Then at turn11: y=2.\n\nBut we are at turn11 at y=2, which is safe.\n\nBut we are at y=2 at turn11 and we want to get to y=9. That's 7 steps away. And we have used 3 turns (turn8,9,10) to get to turn11 at y=2.\n\nNow, after turn11, we can start moving up.\n\nBut we must check the future collisions.\n\nNote that the car configurations change with time.\n\nWe need to simulate the entire path.\n\nLet me write down the plan so far:\n\nTurn8: D -> y=2 at turn9\nTurn9: U -> y=3 at turn10\nTurn10: D -> y=2 at turn11\n\nAt turn11: we are at y=2 (safe, as freeway2 at turn11: [-60,-25] does not contain 0).\n\nNow, we want to move up as much as possible.\n\nBut we must check the next turns.\n\nWe are at turn11 at y=2. We want to go up.\n\nFirst, we can try to go up at turn11: then at turn12: y=3.\n\nCheck freeway3 at turn12: T=12, T-8=4:\n  car1: [-29+24, -18+24] = [-5,6] -> 0 is in this span? Yes, because -5<=0<=6 -> unsafe.\n  car2: [49+24,60+24] = [73,84] -> safe.\n  car3: [13+24,24+24] = [37,48] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway3 at turn12 is unsafe.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at y=3 at turn12.\n\nThen at turn11: we cannot move up? We could stay or move down.\n\nIf we stay at turn11: then at turn12: we are at y=2. Check freeway2 at turn12: T=12, T-8=4: \n  [48-36*4, 83-36*4] = [48-144, 83-144] = [-96,-61] -> 0 not in there -> safe.\n\nSo we can stay at turn11: then at turn12: y=2.\n\nThen at turn12: we are at y=2. Now we can try to move up at turn12: then at turn13: y=3.\n\nCheck freeway3 at turn13: T=13, T-8=5:\n  car1: [-29+30, -18+30] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe? \n      But wait: the span is [1,12] -> 0 is less than 1 -> not included.\n  car2: [49+30,60+30] = [79,90] -> safe.\n  car3: [13+30,24+30] = [43,54] -> safe.\n\nSo freeway3 at turn13 is safe.\n\nSo we can do:\n\nTurn11: S -> stay at y=2 (safe at turn12: freeway2 at turn12 is safe as above)\nTurn12: U -> y=3 at turn13 (safe as above)\n\nNow we are at turn13 at y=3.\n\nThen we want to go up: turn13: U -> y=4 at turn14.\n\nCheck freeway4 at turn14: T=14, T-8=6:\n  car1: [-29+36, -18+36] = [7,18] -> safe (0 not in [7,18])\n  car2: [49+36,60+36] = [85,96] -> safe\n  car3: [13+36,24+36] = [49,60] -> safe\n\nSo safe.\n\nTurn14: U -> y=5 at turn15.\n\nCheck freeway5 at turn15: T=15, T-8=7:\n  Only car: [-29+42, -18+42] = [13,24] -> safe.\n\nTurn15: U -> y=6 at turn16.\n\nCheck freeway6 at turn16: T=16, T-8=8:\n  Only car: [-29+48, -18+48] = [19,30] -> safe.\n\nTurn16: U -> y=7 at turn17.\n\nCheck freeway7 at turn17: T=17, T-8=9:\n  Only car: [-29+54, -18+54] = [25,36] -> safe.\n\nTurn17: U -> y=8 at turn18.\n\nCheck freeway8 at turn18: T=18, T-8=10:\n  Only car: [-29+60, -18+60] = [31,42] -> safe.\n\nTurn18: U -> y=9 at turn19.\n\nAt y=9, we are not on any freeway (since freeways are y=1..8). So we are safe and we reached the goal.\n\nNow, count the turns: we started at turn8 and we ended at turn19? The sequence of actions starts at turn8 and goes to turn18? Because at turn18 we do U and then at turn19 we are at y=9.\n\nThe number of actions: from turn8 to turn18 inclusive is 11 actions? But we can do better?\n\nWait, let me list:\n\nTurn8: D -> done at turn8, then state at turn9: y=2\nTurn9: U -> state at turn10: y=3\nTurn10: D -> state at turn11: y=2\nTurn11: S -> state at turn12: y=2\nTurn12: U -> state at turn13: y=3\nTurn13: U -> state at turn14: y=4\nTurn14: U -> state at turn15: y=5\nTurn15: U -> state at turn16: y=6\nTurn16: U -> state at turn17: y=7\nTurn17: U -> state at turn18: y=8\nTurn18: U -> state at turn19: y=9\n\nSo we used 11 actions (from turn8 to turn18) to get to y=9 at turn19.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nEarlier we had a problem at turn11. We avoided it by going down and then up. But maybe we can avoid the collision at turn11 by being at a safe freeway without going down so much.\n\nAlternatively, we could try to go up slowly.\n\nAnother idea: at turn8: we are at y=3. Instead of going down, we go up to y=4 at turn9.\n\nAt turn9: we are at y=4 (safe as we checked earlier: freeway4 at turn9: cars: [-23,-12], [55,66], [19,30] -> no 0).\n\nThen at turn9: we can stay? Then at turn10: y=4. Check freeway4 at turn10: T=10, T-8=2:\n  car1: [-29+12, -18+12] = [-17,-6] -> safe.\n  car2: [49+12,60+12]=[61,72] -> safe.\n  car3: [13+12,24+12]=[25,36] -> safe.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen at turn10: we are at y=4. Then we need to avoid being at y=4 at turn11? Because freeway4 at turn11: T=11: car1: [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n\nSo at turn10: we must move either up or down.\n\nIf we move up at turn10: then at turn11: y=5 -> unsafe (freeway5 at turn11: [-11,0] -> unsafe).\n\nIf we move down at turn10: then at turn11: y=3 -> unsafe (freeway3 at turn11: car1: [-11,0] -> unsafe).\n\nSo we are stuck again.\n\nThen we must not be at y=3,4,5 at turn11. So we need to be at y=1,2,6,7,8? But we saw that y=6,7,8 are unsafe at turn11. And y=1 and 2: we can try to get to y=2 by turn11 from y=4 at turn10? But we can only move one step per turn: so at turn10 we are at y=4, then we move down to y=3 at turn11 -> unsafe. Or to y=5 at turn11 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot get to y=1 or 2 from y=4 in one move.\n\nTherefore, the only option is to be at y=1 or 2 at turn11 by starting to move down earlier.\n\nBut we already have one path that takes 11 moves.\n\nIs there a way to get to y=9 faster than 11 moves?\n\nNote: the minimal without obstacles is 6 moves. With obstacles, we had to detour.\n\nBut maybe we can avoid the detour by timing differently.\n\nWhat if we stay at y=3 for an extra turn? \n\nAt turn8: we are at y=3 -> safe. Then we choose S (stay) at turn8: then turn9: y=3.\n\nCheck freeway3 at turn9: T=9, T-8=1:\n  car1: [-29+6, -18+6] = [-23,-12] -> safe.\n  car2: [49+6,60+6]=[55,66] -> safe.\n  car3: [13+6,24+6]=[19,30] -> safe.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen at turn9: we are at y=3. Then we can choose to move down to y=2 at turn10.\n\nAt turn10: we are at y=2. Check freeway2 at turn10: T=10, T-8=2: \n  [48-72,83-72] = [-24,11] -> 0 is in there -> unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot move down to y=2 at turn10? Because it's unsafe.\n\nThen at turn9: we move up to y=4? Then at turn10: y=4 (safe as above). Then we are stuck as before at turn10: we cannot avoid turn11 collision.\n\nSo that doesn't help.\n\nWhat if at turn8 we go up to y=4? Then at turn9: y=4. Then at turn9 we go up to y=5? Then at turn10: y=5.\n\nCheck freeway5 at turn10: T=10, T-8=2: \n  car: [-29+12, -18+12] = [-17,-6] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn10: we are at y=5. Then we need to avoid being at y=5 at turn11? Because freeway5 at turn11: T=11: [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n\nSo at turn10: we can move up to y=6? Then at turn11: y=6 -> unsafe (freeway6: [-11,0] at turn11).\n\nOr move down to y=4? Then unsafe at turn11 (freeway4: [-11,0]).\n\nOr stay? Then unsafe.\n\nSo again stuck.\n\nTherefore, the detour we had (going down to y=2 and then up and then down again) seems necessary.\n\nBut we used 11 moves. Can we shorten it?\n\nNotice that after turn11, we had to wait at y=2 for one extra turn (turn11: we did S) to avoid freeway3 at turn12. But is there a way to avoid that?\n\nIn the path we had:\n\nAt turn11: we are at y=2. We did S to avoid going to y=3 at turn12 (which was unsafe). Then at turn12: we moved up to y=3 at turn13 (which was safe).\n\nBut what if we moved up at turn11? Then we would be at y=3 at turn12 -> unsafe. So we had to wait.\n\nBut is freeway3 safe at any turn after turn11? We saw at turn13 it is safe.\n\nBut we cannot go from y=2 to y=3 in one move at turn12? We did that at turn12: from y=2 at turn12 to y=3 at turn13.\n\nBut we did it at turn12: we did U at turn12 -> then at turn13 we are at y=3.\n\nBut we had to spend an extra turn at y=2 (turn11: S).\n\nWhat if we go up at turn11 to y=3? Then at turn12: we are at y=3 -> unsafe. So we cannot.\n\nAlternatively, we could go up at turn11 to y=3 and then immediately at turn12 move up again to y=4? But at turn12 we are at y=3 and then we move to y=4 at turn13. But at turn12 we are at y=3 and that is unsafe.\n\nSo we must avoid being at y=3 at turn12.\n\nTherefore, we have to wait until turn13 to be at y=3.\n\nSo the detour is necessary.\n\nBut is there a way to get to y=9 in fewer than 11 moves?\n\nNote that we are at y=2 at turn11. Then we go up 7 times: from turn11 to turn18: 7 moves? But we did 7 moves from turn12 to turn18? Actually, from turn12 to turn18 we did 7 moves? But we started at turn12 at y=2, then:\n\nturn12: U -> y=3 at turn13\nturn13: U -> y=4 at turn14\nturn14: U -> y=5 at turn15\nturn15: U -> y=6 at turn16\nturn16: U -> y=7 at turn17\nturn17: U -> y=8 at turn18\nturn18: U -> y=9 at turn19\n\nThat's 7 moves. And we had 3 moves to get to turn11 (turn8: D, turn9: U, turn10: D) and then one move at turn11: S. So total 3+1+7 = 11.\n\nBut we can combine: after turn11, we are at y=2. We need to go up 7 times. The minimal moves from y=2 to y=9 is 7 moves. So we cannot do less than 7 upward moves from there.\n\nAnd the detour took 3 moves to get from y=3 to y=2 at turn11, but we had to go back and forth: we went down, then up, then down again? Actually:\n\nAt turn8: D -> from 3 to 2 (one down)\nAt turn9: U -> from 2 to 3 (one up)\nAt turn10: D -> from 3 to 2 (one down)\n\nSo that's 3 moves and we end up at the same y as we started? But we advanced 3 turns. And then we had to stay one turn at turn11: S.\n\nSo total 4 turns to get to turn11 at y=2.\n\nBut we started at turn8 and we are at y=2 at turn11: that's 3 moves (turn8,9,10) and then we are at turn11.\n\nThen we have 7 moves to go up. Total 10 moves? But wait: we have to account for the stay at turn11.\n\nThe actions:\n\nTurn8: D\nTurn9: U\nTurn10: D\nTurn11: S\nTurn12: U\nTurn13: U\nTurn14: U\nTurn15: U\nTurn16: U\nTurn17: U\nTurn18: U\n\nThat's 11 actions. And then at turn19 we are at y=9.\n\nBut the minimal without obstacles is 6, and we used 11. However, we had to avoid turn11 entirely for freeways 3-8.\n\nIs there a path that gets to y=9 earlier? For example, at turn18? Then we would need to be at y=9 at turn18. That means the last action (at turn17) must bring us to y=9.\n\nBut we are at y=3 at turn8. The minimal moves is 6, so the earliest we can be at y=9 is turn14: \n  turn8: U (y4), turn9: U (y5), turn10: U (y6), turn11: U (y7), turn12: U (y8), turn13: U (y9) -> then at turn14 we are at y=9.\n\nBut we saw that at turn11 we are forced to be at a freeway that is unsafe (unless we are at y=1 or 2). And we cannot be at y=1 or 2 at turn11 if we are going straight up.\n\nSo we must avoid being at any freeway in 3-8 at turn11. Therefore, we cannot be at y=3,4,5,6,7,8 at turn11. But in the straight up path, at turn11 we are at y=6 (if we started at turn8: 8->9: y4, 9->10: y5, 10->11: y6). And y=6 is unsafe at turn11.\n\nSo we must be at y=1 or 2 at turn11. Therefore, the earliest we can be at y=9 is after we have done the detour and then the 7 upward moves. The detour takes 3 moves to get to y=2 at turn11 (from turn8 to turn10: 3 moves) and then we must wait at turn11 (if we do S) or move? But if we move at turn11, we can only go to y=1,2, or 3. And we cannot go to y=3 because at turn12 it is unsafe. So we have to wait at turn11 (S) and then start going up at turn12.\n\nSo the total moves are 3 (detour) + 1 (wait) + 7 (up) = 11.\n\nBut note: we are at turn11 at y=2. Then if we could go up 7 times without waiting, that would be 7 moves: turn11:U (y3 at turn12), turn12:U (y4 at turn13), ... turn17:U (y9 at turn18). But we saw that at turn12 if we are at y=3 it is unsafe. So we have to wait at turn11 (S) and then at turn12 we go up to y=3 at turn13 (which is safe).\n\nSo we cannot skip the wait.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, we must write the sequence of actions for turns from 8 to 18 (inclusive).\n\nThe actions are:\n\nTurn 8: D\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: D\nTurn 11: S\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\n\nBut let me verify the entire path:\n\nTurn8: start at (0,3) -> action D -> then at turn9: (0,2)\n  Check turn8: we are at y=3 -> freeway3: safe (as before)\n  After action D, we are at y=2 at turn9.\n\nTurn9: at (0,2) -> freeway2: T=9, T-8=1: [48-36,83-36]=[12,47] -> safe.\n  Then action U -> at turn10: y=3.\n\nTurn10: at (0,3) -> freeway3: T=10, T-8=2: \n      car1: [-29+12, -18+12] = [-17,-6] -> safe\n      car2: [49+12,60+12]=[61,72] -> safe\n      car3: [13+12,24+12]=[25,36] -> safe.\n  Then action D -> at turn11: y=2.\n\nTurn11: at (0,2) -> freeway2: T=11, T-8=3: [48-108,83-108]=[-60,-25] -> safe.\n  Then action S -> at turn12: y=2.\n\nTurn12: at (0,2) -> freeway2: T=12, T-8=4: [48-144,83-144]=[-96,-61] -> safe.\n  Then action U -> at turn13: y=3.\n\nTurn13: at (0,3) -> freeway3: T=13, T-8=5: \n      car1: [-29+30, -18+30]=[1,12] -> safe (0 not in [1,12])\n      car2: [49+30,60+30]=[79,90] -> safe\n      car3: [13+30,24+30]=[43,54] -> safe.\n  Then action U -> at turn14: y=4.\n\nTurn14: at (0,4) -> freeway4: T=14, T-8=6:\n      car1: [-29+36, -18+36]=[7,18] -> safe\n      car2: [49+36,60+36]=[85,96] -> safe\n      car3: [13+36,24+36]=[49,60] -> safe.\n  Then action U -> at turn15: y=5.\n\nTurn15: at (0,5) -> freeway5: T=15, T-8=7: \n      car: [-29+42, -18+42]=[13,24] -> safe.\n  Then action U -> at turn16: y=6.\n\nTurn16: at (0,6) -> freeway6: T=16, T-8=8: \n      car: [-29+48, -18+48]=[19,30] -> safe.\n  Then action U -> at turn17: y=7.\n\nTurn17: at (0,7) -> freeway7: T=17, T-8=9: \n      car: [-29+54, -18+54]=[25,36] -> safe.\n  Then action U -> at turn18: y=8.\n\nTurn18: at (0,8) -> freeway8: T=18, T-8=10: \n      car: [-29+60, -18+60]=[31,42] -> safe.\n  Then action U -> at turn19: y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo the sequence is 11 actions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 8: D\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: D\nTurn 11: S\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\n}\n\nNote: The problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning from t=0 to H-1, so H=11 actions? Yes, from turn8 to turn18 is 11 turns.\n\nBut note: the first action is at t_1 (turn8) and the last action is at turn8+10? Because we have t=0 to t=10? That's 11 actions.\n\nWe start at turn8 and do 11 actions to end at turn18, and then at turn19 we are at the goal.\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence ... to reach (0,9)\". And we reach at turn19. But the sequence of actions is for turns t_1 to t_1+H-1, and after the last action we are at (0,9)? \n\nActually, the player update: after an action at turn t, we are at the new state at turn t+1.\n\nSo after the last action (at turn18), we are at (0,9) at turn19.\n\nBut the problem says \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t_1+H-1? Or at the state after the last action? \n\nLooking at the task: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nSo at turn t_1 + H - 1, we have y = 9.\n\nIn our case, we want y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nWe start at turn8: t_1=8.\n\nAfter H actions, the last action is at turn8 + H - 1.\n\nAnd then the state at turn8 + H (which is the next turn) would be the result of the last action? But the problem says at turn t_1+H-1 we are at y=9.\n\nActually, the state after the last action (at turn t_1+H-1) is the state at the end of that turn? \n\nThe player update: at turn t, we are at state (0, y_t), then we choose a_t, and then we move to y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nSo at the end of turn t, we are at y_{t+1}? \n\nBut the problem defines: \"y_{t+1}\" is the position at the next turn.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn t, we are at y_t. Then we do a_t, and then we are at y_{t+1} at the beginning of turn t+1.\n\nTherefore, we want at the beginning of turn t_1 + H, we are at y=9? \n\nBut the problem says: \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nLet me parse:\n\nThe sequence of actions: a_{t_1} (t=0), a_{t_1+1} (t=1), ..., a_{t_1+H-1} (t=H-1).\n\nAfter taking action a_{t_1+H-1} at turn t_1+H-1, we update to y_{t_1+H} = y_{t_1+H-1} + Delta y_{a_{t_1+H-1}}.\n\nBut the problem requires y_{t_1+H-1} = 9? \n\nThat would mean we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn t_1+H-1? Then we take an action at that turn? But then we would move to y_{t_1+H} which might be 10 or 8? But we are constrained to [0,9]. \n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9)\", meaning we are at (0,9). And it says: \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\".\n\nSo we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn t_1+H-1? Then we don't need to take an action at that turn? But the sequence includes actions until a_{t_1+H-1}.\n\nBut note: the sequence has H actions, starting at t_1 and ending at t_1+H-1. Then at the beginning of turn t_1+H-1, we are at y=9? Then we take an action? But we are already at the goal.\n\nThis seems inconsistent.\n\nLooking at the update: we are at (0, y_t) at turn t. Then we take an action a_t, and then we are at (0, y_{t+1}) at turn t+1.\n\nSo to be at (0,9) at turn T, we must have that at the beginning of turn T, we are at (0,9). \n\nThe last action we take is at some turn t, and then at turn t+1 we are at (0,9).\n\nSo we want turn t+1 = T to be the turn at which we are at (0,9).\n\nThe problem says: after the sequence of H actions (from turn t_1 to turn t_1+H-1), we are at y=9 at turn t_1+H? \n\nBut the condition is: \"y_{t_1+H-1} = 9\" -> that would mean at the beginning of turn t_1+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nBut then we still take an action at turn t_1+H-1? And then we move to y_{t_1+H} which might be 8,9, or 10 (but 10 is invalid). \n\nThat doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that at the end of the last action we are at (0,9). \n\nBut the state at the end of an action at turn t is at turn t+1.\n\nSo if we take H actions, the last action is at turn t_1+H-1, and then at turn t_1+H we are at y=9.\n\nTherefore, we want y_{t_1+H} = 9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\".\n\nThis is a discrepancy.\n\nLooking back at the problem: \n  \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd then in the condition: \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nThis implies that at the beginning of turn t_1+H-1, we are at y=9. But then we take an action at that turn? And then we move to a new state. \n\nBut we are already at the goal. So we should not need to take an action at the goal.\n\nPerhaps the sequence of actions does not include an action at the turn when we are already at the goal? \n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\". Typically, the actions are taken until we reach the goal.\n\nIn our simulation, we took actions until we moved to y=9. The last action (at turn18) moved us to y=9 at turn19.\n\nBut according to the problem, we should be at y=9 at turn t_1+H-1.\n\nIn our case, t_1=8, we want to be at y=9 at turn 8+H-1 = 7+H.\n\nWe ended at turn19: so 7+H = 19 -> H=12? But we took 11 actions.\n\nAlternatively, if we are to be at y=9 at the turn immediately after the last action, then we want y_{t_1+H} = 9.\n\nBut the problem says y_{t_1+H-1}=9.\n\nI think there might be a misunderstanding.\n\nLooking at the answer format: it lists actions for turn t_1, t_1+1, ..., up to some turn.\n\nIn our solution, we have 11 actions: from turn8 to turn18.\n\nAnd we are at y=9 at turn19.\n\nBut the problem says: we must have y_{t_1+H-1}=9.\n\nSo at turn t_1+H-1 = 8+H-1 = 7+H, we must be at y=9.\n\nSet 7+H = 19 -> H=12.\n\nBut we only have 11 actions. That would mean we need to include an extra action? Or we are not at y=9 at turn19? We are.\n\nAlternatively, the problem counts the state after the actions? \n\nI think the problem might have a off-by-one.\n\nBut let me read carefully: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning the actions are for turns t_1+0, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1.\n\nThen the next state after action a_{t_1+H-1} is y_{t_1+H}.\n\nBut the condition is: y_{t_1+H-1} = 9. This would be the state before taking the action at turn t_1+H-1.\n\nThat doesn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps it's a typo and it should be y_{t_1+H} = 9.\n\nGiven that in the initial state at turn t_1, we are at y_{t_1}=3, and we take actions to move to y=9.\n\nIn our simulation, we are at y=9 at turn19 = t_1+11.\n\nSo H should be 11.\n\nBut the condition says y_{t_1+H-1}=9 -> at turn 8+11-1=18, we are at y=9.\n\nIn our simulation, at turn18 (before the last action) we are at y=8. Then we take U and go to y=9 at turn19.\n\nSo to have y_{18}=9, we would need to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn18.\n\nHow can we be at y=9 at turn18? \n\nWe start at turn8 at y=3. We need to be at y=9 at turn18. That's 10 turns later? But we have 10 actions: from turn8 to turn17.\n\nThen the minimal actions would be 6, but we have 10 actions, so we can do it in 6 moves and 4 waits? But we have the turn11 obstacle.\n\nWe can try to be at y=9 by turn18.\n\nAt turn18, we are at y=9 (at the beginning of the turn). Then we don't take any action? But the sequence must include actions until we are at the goal.\n\nBut the problem requires the sequence of actions that leads to the goal, and we are at the goal at the beginning of turn18. Then the last action was at turn17.\n\nSo we need to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn18.\n\nWe start at turn8: y=3.\n\nThen we have 10 turns to act: turn8 to turn17.\n\nWe need to go from y=3 to y=9 in 10 actions? That's possible.\n\nBut we have to avoid the collision at turn11.\n\nWe can try to be at y=1 or 2 at turn11, and then go up to y=9 by turn18.\n\nFrom turn8 to turn11: 4 actions (turn8,9,10,11) to get to y=2 at turn11 (as before).\n\nThen from turn11 to turn18: 7 actions (turn11 to turn17) to go from y=2 to y=9: that requires 7 moves up.\n\nBut we have only 7 actions for 7 moves, so no extra waits.\n\nBut at turn11: we are at y=2. Then if we go up at turn11: then at turn12: y=3. But freeway3 at turn12 is unsafe. So we cannot.\n\nWe must be at y=3 at turn13 (which is safe), not at turn12.\n\nSo we need to wait at turn11: then at turn12: we are at y=2. Then at turn12: we go up to y=3 at turn13.\n\nThen we go up 6 more times: to y=9 at turn19.\n\nBut we want to be at y=9 at turn18.\n\nHow? We are at y=2 at turn12. Then we go up 7 times: \n  turn12: U -> y3 at turn13\n  turn13: U -> y4 at turn14\n  turn14: U -> y5 at turn15\n  turn15: U -> y6 at turn16\n  turn16: U -> y7 at turn17\n  turn17: U -> y8 at turn18\n  turn18: U -> y9 at turn19\n\nSo at turn18, we are at y=8, not 9.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn18, we need to have taken an action at turn17 that moves us to y=9. But we are at y=8 at turn17, then we do U and become y=9 at turn18.\n\nBut then at the beginning of turn18, we are at y=9? No: at the beginning of turn17, we are at y=8. Then we take U at turn17, and then at turn18 we are at y=9.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn18, we are at y=9.\n\nTherefore, to have y_{18}=9, we need to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn18.\n\nThat means the last action was at turn17, and it moved us to y=9 at turn18.\n\nIn our simulation, we are at y=8 at turn17, then we do U at turn17 -> then at turn18 we are at y=9.\n\nSo we are at y=9 at turn18.\n\nTherefore, we want y_{t_1+H-1} = y_{8+H-1} = 9.\n\nSet 8+H-1 = 18 -> H-1=10 -> H=11.\n\nAnd the last action is at turn t_1+H-1 = 8+10 = 18? No: t_1+H-1 = 8 + 11 - 1 = 18.\n\nAnd at turn18, we are at y=9? But no: at turn18, we take an action? \n\nAt the beginning of turn18, we are at y=8. Then we take U, and then at turn19 we are at y=9.\n\nBut the problem says we must be at y=9 at the beginning of turn t_1+H-1=18.\n\nWe are at y=8 at turn18.\n\nSo this does not satisfy.\n\nBut if we want to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn18, then we must have arrived there by the action at turn17.\n\nSo the last action is at turn17. Then the sequence of actions is from turn8 to turn17: 10 actions.\n\nThen H=10.\n\nAnd we want y_{t_1+H-1}=y_{8+10-1}=y_{17}=9.\n\nSo at turn17, we are at y=9.\n\nHow to achieve that?\n\nWe start at turn8: y=3.\n\nWe have 10 actions? No, we have 10 actions: from turn8 to turn17.\n\nBut we need to be at y=9 at turn17 (the beginning of turn17).\n\nThat means the action at turn16 must have moved us to y=9 at turn17.\n\nSo we need to be at y=8 at turn16, then do U at turn16 -> turn17: y=9.\n\nSo we need to be at y=8 at turn16.\n\nThe minimal upward moves is 5 (from 3 to 8) but we have to avoid the obstacles and do the detour.\n\nBut we have 8 actions from turn8 to turn15 to get to y=8 at turn16? \n\nBut we have the turn11 obstacle.\n\nLet me try to plan to be at y=1 or 2 at turn11 and then go up to y=8 by turn16.\n\nFrom turn8 to turn11: we need 4 actions to get to y=2 at turn11? \n\nWe did: \n  turn8: D -> y2 at turn9\n  turn9: U -> y3 at turn10\n  turn10: D -> y2 at turn11\n\nSo at turn11: y=2.\n\nThen we have turn11,12,13,14,15: 5 actions to go from y=2 to y=8? That requires 6 moves up, but we have 5 actions: not enough.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to be at y=2 at turn11 with fewer actions? \n\nWe start at y=3 at turn8.\n\nWe can do:\n  turn8: D -> y2 at turn9\n  turn9: S -> y2 at turn10\n  turn10: S -> y2 at turn11\n\nBut at turn10: freeway2: T=10, T-8=2: [-24,11] -> unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot stay at y=2 at turn10.\n\nOr:\n  turn8: D -> y2 at turn9\n  turn9: D -> y1 at turn10\n  turn10: ? \n\nAt turn10: at y1 -> freeway1: T=10, T-8=2: [-24,11] -> unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=1 at turn10.\n\nTherefore, we cannot avoid the up and down.\n\nWe have to use the 3 actions to be at y=2 at turn11.\n\nThen we need 6 upward moves to get from y=2 to y=8: \n  turn11: U -> y3 at turn12 -> unsafe (freeway3 at turn12: [-5,6] covers 0)\n  so we cannot.\n\nWe have to wait at turn11: S -> y2 at turn12.\nThen turn12: U -> y3 at turn13 (safe)\nThen turn13: U -> y4 at turn14\nturn14: U -> y5 at turn15\nturn15: U -> y6 at turn16\nturn16: U -> y7 at turn17\nturn17: U -> y8 at turn18\n\nThen at turn18, we are at y=8. Then we need one more U to get to y=9 at turn19.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=8 at turn16.\n\nThe earliest we can be at y=8 is turn18.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at y=9 by turn17.\n\nSo the minimal is to be at y=9 at turn19, and we took 11 actions.\n\nBut the problem requires y_{t_1+H-1}=9.\n\nWith t_1=8, and H=11, then t_1+H-1=8+11-1=18.\n\nWe are at y=9 at turn19, not at turn18.\n\nSo to satisfy the condition, we must be at y=9 at turn18.\n\nBut we cannot.\n\nUnless we change the path.\n\nWhat if we go faster? For example, from turn11 at y=2, we do two moves up in a row at some point? But we are blocked at turn12 for freeway3.\n\nAfter turn12, freeway3 is safe at turn13.\n\nSo the earliest we can be at y=3 is turn13.\n\nThen y=4 at turn14, y=5 at turn15, y=6 at turn16, y=7 at turn17, y=8 at turn18, y=9 at turn19.\n\nNo way to compress.\n\nTherefore, the only way is to have the goal at turn19.\n\nBut the problem says y_{t_1+H-1}=9, which would be turn18 for H=11.\n\nSo either the problem has a typo, or I have a mistake.\n\nPerhaps the turn numbering is such that after the action at turn t, the state is for turn t+1, and the condition is on the state after the last action.\n\nBut the problem explicitly says \"y_{t_1+H-1}=9\".\n\nGiven the confusion, and since in our simulation we have a valid path that reaches the goal at turn19, and we took 11 actions, and it's the minimal we found, we output the sequence for turns 8 to 18.\n\nAnd the condition \"y_{t_1+H-1}=9\" might be a mistake and should be \"y_{t_1+H}=9\".\n\nIn many similar problems, the state after the last action is the goal.\n\nSo I think it's safe to output the sequence we have.\n\nSo the answer is as above.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 8\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) by detouring downward to avoid unsafe conditions at turn 11, where freeways 3 to 8 are occupied by cars covering \\(x = 0\\). After turn 11, the path moves upward safely.\n\nThe actions are as follows:\n\n- **Turn 8**: Move down (D) to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 9. Freeway 3 at turn 8 is safe: cars at \\([-17, -6]\\), \\([61, 72]\\), \\([25, 36]\\) do not cover 0.\n- **Turn 9**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 10. Freeway 2 at turn 9 is safe: car at \\([12, 47]\\) does not cover 0.\n- **Turn 10**: Move down (D) to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 11. Freeway 3 at turn 10 is safe: cars at \\([-17, -6]\\), \\([61, 72]\\), \\([25, 36]\\) do not cover 0.\n- **Turn 11**: Stay (S) at \\(y = 2\\) for turn 12. Freeway 2 at turn 11 is safe: car at \\([-60, -25]\\) does not cover 0.\n- **Turn 12**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 13. Freeway 2 at turn 12 is safe: car at \\([-96, -61]\\) does not cover 0.\n- **Turn 13**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 14. Freeway 3 at turn 13 is safe: cars at \\([1, 12]\\), \\([79, 90]\\), \\([43, 54]\\) do not cover 0.\n- **Turn 14**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 15. Freeway 4 at turn 14 is safe: cars at \\([7, 18]\\), \\([85, 96]\\), \\([49, 60]\\) do not cover 0.\n- **Turn 15**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 16. Freeway 5 at turn 15 is safe: car at \\([13, 24]\\) does not cover 0.\n- **Turn 16**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 17. Freeway 6 at turn 16 is safe: car at \\([19, 30]\\) does not cover 0.\n- **Turn 17**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 18. Freeway 7 at turn 17 is safe: car at \\([25, 36]\\) does not cover 0.\n- **Turn 18**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19. Freeway 8 at turn 18 is safe: car at \\([31, 42]\\) does not cover 0.\n\nAfter the last action at turn 18, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 19.

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 9, and the player is at (0,2). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to 8). We can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). Note that we are only at risk of collision when we are on a freeway row (y=1 to 8) and only for the car on that same freeway at the same turn.\n\nImportant note: Collision occurs at turn T if at that turn the player is on a freeway row k (so y_T = k) and the car on freeway k at turn T has its span covering the x-coordinate 0.\n\nAlso note: The player's x-coordinate is always 0, so we only care about whether 0 is in the car's span at the turn we are on that freeway.\n\nThe car update:\n- For a left-moving car (d = left): at turn T, the span is [h - s*(T - t1), tau - s*(T - t1)]? But note the given state is at turn t1=9.\n  Actually, the rule says: for left-moving, the car moves to the left as time increases. So at time T, the head (which was at h at t1) becomes h - s*(T-t1), and the tail becomes tau - s*(T-t1). But note: the head is the front? For left-moving, if the car is moving left, then the head (leading part) would be the rightmost part? Actually, the problem defines:\n    Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n  But note: if the car is moving left, then the entire car shifts left. So the head (which was at h) moves to h - s*(T-t1) and the tail (which was at tau) moves to tau - s*(T-t1). However, we must note that the span might be given such that h > tau? Actually, the problem says for left-moving: Span(t1)=[h, tau]. But if the car is moving left, and the head is at a larger x than the tail? That doesn't make sense. Let me check the example.\n\n  Looking at freeway 1: (12,47,left,36) -> wait, head=12, tail=47? That would imply the tail is at 47 and head at 12? But then the car would be from 12 to 47? and moving left? Then at T, the car would be [12 - 36*(T-9), 47 - 36*(T-9)]. But note: 12 < 47, so the car is from 12 to 47? Then moving left, the entire segment moves left.\n\n  However, for freeway 3: we have three cars. The first is (-12,-23,right,6). For right-moving: the span is given as [tau, head]? The problem says: for right-moving, Span(t1)=[tau, head] -> becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]. So in this case, tau=-23, head=-12? Then the car is from -23 to -12? and moving right.\n\n  So the representation for a car is:\n    - Left-moving: [h, tau] with h and tau being the coordinates at t1. The car is from min(h,tau) to max(h,tau)? But note: the problem says \"head\" and \"tail\". For left-moving, if the car is moving left, the head is the front (which is the leftmost part? or the rightmost part?).\n\n  Actually, the update rule clarifies: for left-moving, the entire car moves left. So the head (which is the front of the car in the direction of travel) is moving left. Therefore, if the car is moving left, the head should be the rightmost point? Because when it moves left, the head becomes the leftmost? Not necessarily. The update rule does not specify which is larger. We have to consider the span as an interval.\n\n  The key is: the car at time T on freeway k will cause a collision at (0, k) at time T if 0 is in the interval of the car at time T.\n\n  For left-moving car: at time T, the car is [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. Since the car is contiguous, we need to consider the interval from min(h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)) to max(h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)).\n\n  Similarly for right-moving: [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)] -> then the interval is from min(tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)) to max(tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)).\n\n  But note: the problem says for right-moving: the initial span is [tau, head]. So if tau < head, then the car is from tau to head. If tau > head, then the car is from head to tau? Actually, the update rule shifts both by the same amount. So the relative order of head and tail doesn't change? Actually, the problem does not specify which is the left and which is the right. We must interpret the span as an interval that is contiguous.\n\n  Therefore, to check if 0 is in the car's span at time T, we can define:\n      left_moving: \n          low = min(h, tau) - s*(T-t1)\n          high = max(h, tau) - s*(T-t1)\n      right_moving:\n          low = min(tau, head) + s*(T-t1)\n          high = max(tau, head) + s*(T-t1)\n\n  However, wait: the problem defines the update as:\n      Left: [h, tau] -> [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n      Right: [tau, head] -> [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]\n\n  But note that the initial representation might have h and tau in any order? Actually, the problem does not specify that h is the front. It just says \"head\" and \"tail\". For left-moving, the head is the leading part? Then if moving left, the head would be the leftmost? Then the tail would be to the right? So the car would be from head (left) to tail (right). Then at time T, the head moves to head - s*(T-t1) and the tail moves to tail - s*(T-t1). So the entire interval shifts left.\n\n  Similarly, for right-moving: the head is the leading part (rightmost) and the tail is the leftmost? Then the initial span is [tail, head]? But the problem says [tau, head] for right-moving. So if tau is the tail (leftmost) and head is the head (rightmost), then the car is from tau to head. Then when moving right, the car becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)].\n\n  Therefore, we can assume:\n      Left-moving: car at t1 is [head, tail] meaning from head to tail, and note that head <= tail? But in freeway1: head=12, tail=47 -> so head=12, tail=47 -> the car is from 12 to 47? Then moving left: at time T, it becomes [12-36*(T-9), 47-36*(T-9)]. So the entire segment moves left.\n\n      Right-moving: car at t1 is [tau, head] meaning from tau to head. For freeway3: first car: tau=-23, head=-12 -> so from -23 to -12. Then at time T, becomes [-23+6*(T-9), -12+6*(T-9)].\n\n  But wait: the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1)=[tau, head]\". So the representation for the car is given as [tau, head] and then updated by adding s*(T-t1) to both.\n\n  So to compute the interval at time T for a car:\n      If left-moving: \n          interval = [head - s*(T-t1), tail - s*(T-t1)]   but note: we don't know if head<tail? \n          Actually, the problem doesn't specify, but from the examples: \n            freeway1: head=12, tail=47 -> so head < tail -> the car is [12,47] at t1.\n            freeway3: the right-moving cars: first car: tau=-23, head=-12 -> tau=-23 < head=-12? No, -23 < -12 is true? Actually, -23 is less than -12. So the car is from -23 to -12? Then moving right: at T, from -23+6*(T-9) to -12+6*(T-9).\n\n  Therefore, we can always represent the car at time T as:\n      left_moving: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]   -> then the interval is from min(h, tau) - s*(T-t1) to max(h, tau) - s*(T-t1) ? \n      Actually, no: because the update is applied to both endpoints. So the relative order remains. So if at t1, the car is from h to tau (which might be in any order), then at T, the two endpoints are h - s*(T-t1) and tau - s*(T-t1). The interval is the set of points between the two. So we can compute:\n          low = min( h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1) )\n          high = max( h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1) )\n\n      Similarly for right_moving:\n          low = min( tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1) )\n          high = max( tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1) )\n\n  But note: the problem states the representation at t1: for left-moving it's [h, tau] and for right-moving it's [tau, head]. However, the update rule is linear so the min and max can be computed accordingly.\n\n  However, we can avoid confusion by noting: the car is a contiguous segment. So we can compute:\n      For any car, at time T, the car occupies an interval [A, B] where:\n        if left-moving: \n            A = min(h, tau) - s*(T-t1)\n            B = max(h, tau) - s*(T-t1)\n        if right-moving:\n            A = min(tau, head) + s*(T-t1)\n            B = max(tau, head) + s*(T-t1)\n\n  But wait: the problem says for right-moving, the initial representation is [tau, head] meaning the car is from tau to head? Then if tau < head, the car is [tau, head]. If tau > head, then the car is [head, tau]? Actually, the problem does not specify, but the update rule adds the same amount to both. So the interval at T is [min(tau,head)+s*(T-t1), max(tau,head)+s*(T-t1)].\n\n  However, looking at the data: \n      freeway3: (-12, -23, right, 6) -> here tau = -12, head = -23? Then min(tau,head)=min(-12,-23)=-23, max=-12. So the car is from -23 to -12? But the representation [tau, head] = [-12, -23] would be interpreted as from -12 to -23? That is backwards. \n\n  This suggests that the representation [tau, head] for right-moving might be given in the order of the endpoints, but the update rule adds the same amount to both. So the car is actually the segment between the two points. Therefore, the interval at time T is [min(tau, head) + s*(T-t1), max(tau, head) + s*(T-t1)].\n\n  Similarly, for left-moving: the representation [h, tau] might not be ordered? Then we take min and max.\n\n  Therefore, we can define for every car:\n      Let A0 = min(endpoint1, endpoint2) at t1\n      Let B0 = max(endpoint1, endpoint2) at t1\n      Then at time T:\n          if left-moving: [A0 - s*(T-t1), B0 - s*(T-t1)]\n          if right-moving: [A0 + s*(T-t1), B0 + s*(T-t1)]\n\n  But note: the problem gives for left-moving: (head, tail) and for right-moving: (tail, head)? Actually, the representation is:\n      Left: (head, tail, direction, speed)\n      Right: (tail, head, direction, speed) -> but wait, the freeway3 is given as: (-12, -23, right, 6). So the first number is tail? the second is head? \n\n  The problem says for right-moving: \"Cars: (head, tail, direction, speed)\" -> no, the table says: \"Cars (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s)\". Then for freeway3: the first car is (h=-12, tau=-23, right, 6). But then for right-moving, the problem says the span is [tau, head] = [-23, -12]? That would be the correct order (from -23 to -12). \n\n  So actually, the representation in the input is:\n      For a car: (h, tau, d, s)\n      Then:\n          if d = left: the car at t1 is [h, tau] -> meaning from h to tau? but we don't know which is smaller? \n          if d = right: the car at t1 is [tau, head]? -> but the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1)=[tau, head]\". \n\n  However, in the input for freeway3: the car is (-12, -23, right, 6). Then the span is [tau, head] = [-23, -12]? That makes sense: from -23 to -12. \n\n  For freeway1: (12,47,left,36): the span is [12,47]? Then moving left.\n\n  Therefore, we can compute the interval at time T for a car as:\n      if d == \"left\":\n          A = min(h, tau) - s*(T - t1)\n          B = max(h, tau) - s*(T - t1)\n      if d == \"right\":\n          A = min(tau, h) + s*(T - t1)   # because the representation [tau, head] and we want the min and max of the two endpoints\n          B = max(tau, h) + s*(T - t1)\n\n  But wait: in the right-moving representation, the problem says [tau, head]. So we are given tau and head. The min and max of tau and head? Then we shift by s*(T-t1). \n\n  However, note that in the right-moving example: tau=-23, head=-12 -> min=-23, max=-12. Then at T, the car is [-23 + 6*(T-9), -12 + 6*(T-9)].\n\n  So the formula holds.\n\n  Therefore, for each car on a freeway, at a given turn T, we can compute the interval [A, B] and then check if 0 is between A and B (inclusive).\n\n  Now, the player is at (0, y) at turn T. Collision occurs if at turn T, the player is on a freeway row k (so y=k, and k between 1 and 8) and there is at least one car on freeway k at turn T that has A <= 0 <= B.\n\n  We are starting at turn t1=9 at y=2. We want to get to y=9. We can only change y by at most 1 per turn. So the minimal number of turns in the absence of cars is 7 (because 9-2=7, so 7 moves up). But we have to avoid cars.\n\n  We are going to simulate the moves. We need to find the minimal H and a sequence of actions.\n\n  Since H is minimal, we want to go up as much as possible. But we have to avoid collisions.\n\n  The plan: we can try to simulate from turn 9 onward, and for each turn, we can choose U, D, or S. We are at y=2 at turn9.\n\n  We note that the goal is to reach y=9. We cannot go above 9, and if we go to 9 we are safe (since freeways are only 1-8).\n\n  Steps:\n      We'll try to do a BFS in the state space: state = (turn, y). The turn starts at 9 and increases. We want to find the minimal H such that at turn t1+H-1 we are at y=9.\n\n      The actions: U, D, S. Then the next state: \n          turn' = turn + 1\n          y' = y + (1 if U, -1 if D, 0 if S) and clamped between 0 and 9.\n\n      But note: we must check for collisions at the new state? Actually, at the current turn we are at (0,y) and we choose an action that leads to (0,y') at the next turn? \n\n      Important: the problem says: \n          \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\n      And note: when we are at turn T, we are at y_T. Then we choose an action that will move us to y_{T+1}. But during turn T, we are on freeway y_T (if y_T is between 1 and 8) and we must not collide at that turn.\n\n      Also note: at the next turn (T+1), we will be at y_{T+1}, and then we check for collision at turn T+1.\n\n      So when we simulate:\n          Start at turn9: we are at y=2. We must check: is there a collision at turn9 at freeway2? \n          Then we choose an action (U, D, S) and then at turn10 we are at y' (which is 3 if U, 1 if D, 2 if S). Then we check collision at turn10 at the new y'.\n\n      We are not concerned with the intermediate positions? Only at the turn we are at that freeway.\n\n  Therefore, the BFS state: (t, y) where t is the current turn (starting at 9) and y is the current vertical position.\n\n      Goal: when y=9, we stop.\n\n      We avoid states that have been visited at the same (t,y) if we found a shorter path? Actually, we are doing BFS by the number of steps, so the first time we reach (t, y) we have the minimal steps to that state. But note: we might have the same (t,y) by different paths? But we can mark visited states by (t,y) because the future car positions are deterministic and depend only on t (the turn number).\n\n      However, note that the car positions depend on t (the absolute turn number). So at a given turn t, the car positions are fixed. Therefore, the state (t,y) is sufficient.\n\n  Algorithm:\n\n      Let t0 = 9, y0 = 2.\n\n      We'll use a queue for BFS: each element = (t, y, path_actions) \n          where path_actions is the sequence of actions taken from the start until the current state.\n\n      We mark visited: (t,y) to avoid revisiting.\n\n      Steps:\n        Initialize: \n            queue = [(9, 2, [])]   # at turn9, y=2, no actions taken so far (but note: we are about to choose the first action for turn9)\n            visited = set((9,2))\n\n        While queue not empty:\n            pop state (t, y, path)\n\n            If y == 9: we have a solution with H = len(path) (because we are at the state after taking len(path) actions, and we are at y=9 at turn = 9 + len(path)). But note: we are at turn t, and we started at turn9. The number of actions we've taken is (t - 9). And we are at state (t,y). \n\n            Actually, our state: at the beginning of turn t, we are at y. Then we choose an action a_t, and then we move to turn t+1 and y_{t+1}=y+delta.\n\n            How we model:\n                We are at (t, y) and we have not yet chosen the action for turn t. Then we choose an action, and then we end up at (t+1, y') and then we check collision at turn t? Actually, we must check collision at turn t: because we are at (0,y) at turn t. \n\n            Therefore, when we are at state (t,y) (at the start of turn t, we are at y), we must first check if we are on a freeway (y between 1 and 8) and if there is a collision at turn t. If there is, then we cannot be at this state? \n\n            But wait: how did we get to this state? The previous action brought us to (t,y). Then we must check collision at turn t. \n\n            However, at the start: at turn9, we are at (0,2). We are about to choose an action for turn9. But we are already at turn9? So we must check collision at turn9 at freeway2.\n\n            Therefore, when we pop a state (t,y), we must check if that state is safe? \n\n            Actually, we check at the time we are at that state: at turn t, we are at (0,y). If y is in [1,8] (freeway) and there is a car on freeway y at turn t that covers 0, then we cannot be at this state -> skip.\n\n            But note: if y=0 or y=9, then we are not on a freeway -> safe.\n\n            Then, if the state is safe, we can then choose the next action.\n\n            Then, for each action in [U, D, S]:\n                next_y = y + (1 if U, -1 if D, 0 if S)\n                next_y = max(0, min(9, next_y))\n                next_t = t + 1\n\n                Then we don't check collision at next_t yet, because we haven't arrived at next_t? We will check when we pop (next_t, next_y).\n\n            But note: the action we choose is for the current turn t. Then at turn t, we are at (0,y) and then we move to (0,next_y) at turn t+1. The collision at turn t has already been checked (when we popped (t,y)).\n\n            So we only check collision at the state (t,y) when we are about to process it.\n\n            Then, if we haven't visited (next_t, next_y), we push it.\n\n      However, we are starting at (9,2). We check collision at (9,2): freeway2.\n\n      Freeway2: at turn9, cars: (12,47,left,36) -> but wait, the table says freeway2 has the same car as freeway1: (12,47,left,36). \n\n      How many cars per freeway? The table lists one car for freeway2? Actually, the table says \"Cars\" and then a list. For freeway2: only one car: (12,47,left,36). \n\n      We need to check if at turn9, freeway2: car (12,47,left,36) -> \n          left-moving: \n             A = min(12,47) - 36*(9-9) = 12\n             B = max(12,47) - 0 = 47\n          The interval at turn9 is [12,47]. Is 0 in [12,47]? No. So safe.\n\n      Therefore, we start.\n\n      Then we consider actions: U, D, S.\n\n        U: next_y = 3 -> state (10,3)\n        D: next_y = 1 -> state (10,1)\n        S: next_y = 2 -> state (10,2)\n\n      Then we push these states.\n\n      But note: we must check at the next state when we pop it: at turn10, at freeway3? for (10,3): freeway3.\n\n      Freeway3 at turn10: \n          Cars: three cars: \n             car1: (-12,-23,right,6) -> right-moving: \n                 A = min(tau, head) + 6*(10-9) = min(-12,-23) + 6 = -23+6 = -17\n                 B = max(-12,-23) + 6 = -12+6 = -6\n                 Interval: [-17, -6] -> 0 not in there -> safe for car1?\n                 But wait: we have three cars? We must check each.\n\n          car2: (-48,-59,right,6) -> \n                 A = min(-48,-59) + 6 = -59+6 = -53\n                 B = max(-48,-59) + 6 = -48+6 = -42 -> [-53,-42] -> no 0.\n\n          car3: (30,19,right,6) -> \n                 This one: min(30,19)=19, max=30 -> then A=19+6=25, B=30+6=36 -> [25,36] -> no 0.\n\n          So freeway3 at turn10 is safe.\n\n      Similarly, check (10,1): freeway1 at turn10:\n          Car: (12,47,left,36) -> \n                A = min(12,47) - 36*(10-9) = 12-36 = -24\n                B = 47-36 = 11\n                Interval: [-24,11] -> 0 is in there? yes, because -24<=0<=11 -> collision!\n\n          Therefore, if we go to (10,1) we would be in a collision. So we skip that state.\n\n      (10,2): freeway2 at turn10:\n          Car: (12,47,left,36) -> \n                A = min(12,47)-36*(10-9)=12-36=-24\n                B = 47-36=11\n                Interval: [-24,11] -> 0 in there -> collision! so skip.\n\n      Therefore, only (10,3) is safe.\n\n      Then from (10,3): we can choose U, D, S -> next_y: 4,2,3 -> states (11,4), (11,2), (11,3)\n\n      Now check each at turn11:\n\n        (11,4): freeway4 at turn11: \n            Cars: three cars (same as freeway3 at t1? but freeway4 has the same cars: (-12,-23,right,6), (-48,-59,right,6), (30,19,right,6)\n            car1: A = min(-12,-23) + 6*(11-9) = -23 + 12 = -11, B = -12+12=0 -> interval: [-11,0] -> 0 is included? yes -> collision.\n\n            Actually: 0 is at the endpoint. The problem says \"if 0 in Span(T)\" -> so if the interval is inclusive, then 0 is in [-11,0] -> collision.\n\n            Therefore, (11,4) is unsafe.\n\n        (11,2): freeway2 at turn11: \n            Car: (12,47,left,36) -> \n                  A = min(12,47) - 36*(11-9)=12-72=-60, B=47-72=-25 -> interval [-60,-25] -> 0 not in -> safe? \n            But wait: the car moves left, so at turn11, the car is from -60 to -25? Then 0 is not in that interval. So safe.\n\n            Therefore, (11,2) is safe.\n\n        (11,3): freeway3 at turn11:\n            car1: min(-12,-23)+6*(11-9)= -23+12=-11, max(-12,-23)+12=-12+12=0 -> [-11,0] -> 0 is included -> collision.\n\n            So unsafe.\n\n      Then we have only (11,2) from (10,3) by choosing D? \n\n        How did we get to (11,2)? \n          At turn10: we were at (10,3). Then we chose D -> next_y=3-1=2 -> then at turn11, we are at (11,2).\n\n      Then we push (11,2) with the path: initially at (9,2) we chose U to go to (10,3), then at (10,3) we chose D to go to (11,2).\n\n      Now, from (11,2): we can choose U, D, S -> next_y: 3,1,2 -> states (12,3), (12,1), (12,2)\n\n      Check each at turn12:\n\n        (12,3): freeway3 at turn12:\n            car1: min(-12,-23)+6*(12-9)= -23+18=-5, max(-12,-23)+18=-12+18=6 -> [-5,6] -> 0 in? yes -> collision.\n\n        (12,1): freeway1 at turn12:\n            car: (12,47,left,36) -> \n                  A = min(12,47)-36*(12-9)=12-108=-96, B=47-108=-61 -> [-96,-61] -> no 0 -> safe.\n\n        (12,2): freeway2 at turn12:\n            car: (12,47,left,36) -> \n                  A=12-36*3=12-108=-96, B=47-108=-61 -> same as above -> safe.\n\n      So we have (12,1) and (12,2) safe.\n\n      Then we push both.\n\n      We continue until we reach y=9.\n\n  However, we are looking for minimal H. Since we are doing BFS, the first time we reach y=9 we have the minimal H.\n\n  But note: we started at turn9 and we are at (9,2). Then after H actions, we are at turn9+H and y=9.\n\n  We want to output the actions for turns: t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1.\n\n  We'll break when we first reach a state (t,9) that is safe (and then we don't need to go further from that state).\n\n  Let's code the BFS with the collision checks.\n\n  We'll precompute for each freeway k (1..8) and for each turn T (starting from 9 and going up) the set of cars? Actually, we can compute for a given freeway k and turn T: check all cars on that freeway at the initial state (given) at turn T.\n\n  The initial state for cars is at turn9. For a freeway k, we have a list of cars: each car is (h, tau, d, s). \n\n  Then for a given (k, T), we can compute for each car on k:\n        if d==\"left\": \n            A = min(h,tau) - s*(T-9)\n            B = max(h,tau) - s*(T-9)\n        if d==\"right\":\n            A = min(tau, h) + s*(T-9)   # note: for right-moving, the representation is (h, tau) but the problem says the initial span is [tau, head] -> so we use min(tau,h) and max(tau,h)\n            B = max(tau, h) + s*(T-9)\n\n        Then check if 0 is in [A, B] (i.e., A<=0<=B). If at least one car has that, then freeway k at turn T is unsafe.\n\n  We can cache this per (k,T) to avoid recomputation.\n\n  Steps for BFS:\n\n      Let queue = deque([(9, 2, [])])   # (t, y, path_actions)\n      visited = set() -> store (t,y)\n\n      while queue:\n          pop state (t, y, path)\n\n          if y == 9: \n              then we output the path and break.\n\n          # Check if current state (t,y) is safe?\n          if y in [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]:   # freeway\n              # Check freeway y at turn t: \n              if there is any car on freeway y that at turn t has 0 in its span -> then collision -> skip this state.\n          else: # y=0 or y=9 -> safe\n              pass\n\n          If safe, then for each action in ['U','D','S']:\n              next_y = y + (1 if 'U', -1 if 'D', 0 if 'S')\n              next_y = max(0, min(9, next_y))\n              next_t = t+1\n\n              If (next_t, next_y) not in visited:\n                  visited.add((next_t, next_y))\n                  new_path = path + [action]   # the action taken at turn t\n                  push (next_t, next_y, new_path)\n\n      If we break at the goal, then H = len(new_path) and the actions are for turns 9, 10, ... 9+H-1.\n\n  But note: when we are at the goal state (y=9) we don't need to check for collision? because y=9 is not a freeway. So we break.\n\n  However, we check the goal state when we pop it: if it's safe? and then we break. But since y=9 is safe, we break.\n\n  Now, we need to compute the collision for a given freeway k and turn t.\n\n  We are given the initial cars at turn9 for each freeway:\n\n      freeway1: [ (12,47,left,36) ]\n      freeway2: [ (12,47,left,36) ]\n      freeway3: [ (-12,-23,right,6), (-48,-59,right,6), (30,19,right,6) ]\n      freeway4: [ (-12,-23,right,6), (-48,-59,right,6), (30,19,right,6) ]\n      freeway5: [ (-12,-23,right,6) ]\n      freeway6: [ (-12,-23,right,6) ]\n      freeway7: [ (-12,-23,right,6) ]\n      freeway8: [ (-12,-23,right,6) ]\n\n  We'll write a helper function: is_safe(k, t) -> bool: returns True if at freeway k at turn t, there is no collision at (0,k) (i.e., no car covers 0).\n\n      For each car on freeway k (from the initial list at turn9):\n          (h, tau, d, s) = car\n          if d==\"left\":\n              A = min(h, tau) - s*(t-9)\n              B = max(h, tau) - s*(t-9)\n          else: # right\n              A = min(tau, h) + s*(t-9)   # note: the representation for right: the initial span is [tau, head] -> so we use min(tau,h) and max(tau,h) for the endpoints?\n              B = max(tau, h) + s*(t-9)\n\n          But wait: the representation for the car is given as (h, tau) for both? The problem says the cars are given as (head, tail, direction, speed). Then for left: we use head and tail? and for right: we use tail and head? \n\n          Actually, the problem states the initial representation for the car as (head, tail, ...). Then for left: the span is [head, tail]? and for right: the span is [tail, head]? \n\n          Therefore, we should use:\n\n            if d==\"left\":\n                A = min(head, tail) - s*(t-9)\n                B = max(head, tail) - s*(t-9)\n            if d==\"right\":\n                # the initial span is [tail, head] -> so we use:\n                A = min(tail, head) + s*(t-9)\n                B = max(tail, head) + s*(t-9)\n\n          However, in the input for a right-moving car, the first number is head? and the second is tail? \n\n          The table: freeway3: (-12,-23,right,6) -> so head=-12, tail=-23? Then for right-moving: the span is [tail, head] = [-23,-12]. Then we use:\n                A = min(-23,-12) = -23, B = -12, then add s*(t-9): so A = -23+6*(t-9), B=-12+6*(t-9)\n\n          This matches the example.\n\n          Therefore, we use:\n            if d==\"left\":\n                A = min(h, tau) - s*(t-9)\n                B = max(h, tau) - s*(t-9)\n            if d==\"right\":\n                A = min(tau, h) + s*(t-9)   # but note: the given h is head and tau is tail? \n                # Actually, the input gives (head, tail) for the car. Then for right, we use tail and head? \n                # The problem says for right: the span is [tau, head] -> which is [tail, head]. \n                # So we use:\n                #   A = min(tail, head) + s*(t-9)\n                #   B = max(tail, head) + s*(t-9)\n\n          But note: in the input, the car is represented as (head, tail, ...). So for a right-moving car, we have head and tail, and then we know the span is [tail, head]. Therefore, we can compute:\n                A = min(tail, head) + s*(t-9)\n                B = max(tail, head) + s*(t-9)\n\n          Similarly for left: [head, tail] -> then A = min(head, tail) - s*(t-9), B = max(head, tail) - s*(t-9).\n\n      Then, if A <= 0 <= B -> collision -> return False.\n\n      If we check all cars and none covers 0, then return True.\n\n  However, note: the problem says the car state at turn9. And we are given the cars for each freeway.\n\n  We'll pre-store the cars per freeway:\n\n      cars = {\n          1: [ (12, 47, 'left', 36) ],\n          2: [ (12, 47, 'left', 36) ],\n          3: [ (-12, -23, 'right', 6), (-48, -59, 'right', 6), (30, 19, 'right', 6) ],\n          4: [ (-12, -23, 'right', 6), (-48, -59, 'right', 6), (30, 19, 'right', 6) ],\n          5: [ (-12, -23, 'right', 6) ],\n          6: [ (-12, -23, 'right', 6) ],\n          7: [ (-12, -23, 'right', 6) ],\n          8: [ (-12, -23, 'right', 6) ]\n      }\n\n  Then is_safe(k, t):\n      if k not in [1,2,...,8]: # not a freeway? but k should be 1..8\n          return True   # but the function is called for freeway k, so k in 1..8\n      for car in cars[k]:\n          head = car[0]\n          tail = car[1]\n          d = car[2]\n          s = car[3]\n          if d == 'left':\n              A = min(head, tail) - s*(t-9)\n              B = max(head, tail) - s*(t-9)\n          else: # right\n              A = min(tail, head) + s*(t-9)\n              B = max(tail, head) + s*(t-9)\n          if A <= 0 <= B:\n              return False\n      return True\n\n  However, note: the problem says the car state is at turn9. So for turn t, we use (t-9) as the time difference.\n\n  Now, we run the BFS.\n\n  We start at (9,2,[]). We check safety at (9,2): freeway2 -> is_safe(2,9) -> \n        car: (12,47,left,36): \n            A = min(12,47) - 36*0 = 12\n            B = 47 -> [12,47] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n  Then we generate next states: (10,3), (10,1), (10,2) -> and mark visited.\n\n  Then we pop (10,3, ['U']): \n        check (10,3): freeway3 -> is_safe(3,10) -> \n            car1: (-12,-23,right,6): \n                A = min(-23,-12) + 6*(1) = -23+6 = -17\n                B = -12+6 = -6 -> [-17,-6] -> 0 not in -> safe for this car.\n            car2: (-48,-59,right,6): \n                A = min(-59,-48) + 6 = -59+6=-53\n                B = -48+6 = -42 -> [-53,-42] -> safe.\n            car3: (30,19,right,6): \n                A = min(19,30)+6 = 19+6=25\n                B = 30+6=36 -> safe.\n            -> safe.\n\n        Then generate next states: (11,4), (11,2), (11,3)\n\n  Then we pop (10,1, ['D']): \n        check (10,1): freeway1 -> \n            car: (12,47,left,36): \n                A = min(12,47)-36 = 12-36=-24\n                B = 47-36=11 -> 0 in [-24,11] -> unsafe -> skip.\n\n  Then pop (10,2,['S']): \n        check (10,2): freeway2 -> \n            car: (12,47,left,36): \n                A = min(12,47)-36=-24, B=11 -> 0 in -> unsafe -> skip.\n\n  Then we have only (10,3,['U']) in the queue? Then we pop it and then we generate (11,4), (11,2), (11,3).\n\n  Then we check:\n        (11,4): freeway4 at turn11 -> \n            cars: same as freeway3 at turn11? \n            car1: (-12,-23,right,6): \n                A = min(-23,-12) + 6*(11-9)= -23+12=-11\n                B = -12+12=0 -> [-11,0] -> 0 is included -> unsafe.\n            so skip.\n\n        (11,2): freeway2 at turn11 -> \n            car: (12,47,left,36): \n                A = min(12,47)-36*(11-9)=12-72=-60\n                B=47-72=-25 -> [-60,-25] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n            so we push (11,2, ['U','D'])\n\n        (11,3): freeway3 at turn11 -> \n            car1: (-12,-23,right,6): \n                A = min(-23,-12)+12 = -23+12=-11\n                B = -12+12=0 -> 0 in -> unsafe -> skip.\n\n  Then we have (11,2,['U','D']).\n\n  Then from (11,2): \n        actions: U->3, D->1, S->2 -> states (12,3), (12,1), (12,2)\n\n        Check (12,3): freeway3 at turn12 -> \n            car1: (-12,-23,right,6): \n                A = min(-23,-12)+6*(12-9)= -23+18=-5\n                B = -12+18=6 -> [-5,6] -> 0 in -> unsafe.\n\n        (12,1): freeway1 at turn12 -> \n            car: (12,47,left,36): \n                A = 12-36*3=12-108=-96\n                B=47-108=-61 -> [-96,-61] -> safe.\n\n        (12,2): freeway2 at turn12 -> \n            car: (12,47,left,36): \n                A=12-108=-96, B=47-108=-61 -> safe.\n\n        So we push (12,1, ['U','D','D']) and (12,2, ['U','D','S'])\n\n        But wait: from (11,2) by U: next_y=3 -> (12,3) -> unsafe.\n                   by D: next_y=1 -> (12,1) -> safe -> so action sequence: ['U','D','D'] -> then at turn12 we are at y=1.\n                   by S: next_y=2 -> (12,2) -> safe -> action sequence: ['U','D','S'] -> at turn12 at y=2.\n\n  Then we continue.\n\n  We want to get to 9. We have a long way. We might need to wait sometimes.\n\n  Since we are doing BFS, we will eventually find the shortest path.\n\n  However, the state space is infinite? because t can go to infinity. But we are only moving in y from 0 to 9, and we have a goal. The minimal H is at least 7. We can set a limit? but we don't know how long. Alternatively, we can use Dijkstra? but the cost is the number of steps. BFS by steps (each step is 1) is optimal.\n\n  We'll run until we find the goal.\n\n  We'll simulate until we find a path.\n\n  But note: we might get stuck in a loop? We need to avoid revisiting (t,y) with the same t and y? We mark visited by (t,y). So we won't visit the same (t,y) twice.\n\n  However, t increases, so the state space is infinite? But note that the car positions are periodic? \n\n  Let's check the cars:\n\n      For freeway1: left-moving at speed 36: \n          The car moves 36 per turn. The initial span is [12,47]. Then at turn9: [12,47]\n          turn10: [12-36,47-36] = [-24,11]\n          turn11: [-60,-25]\n          turn12: [-96,-61]\n          turn13: [-132,-97] ... so the car moves left and never comes back? \n\n      For freeway3: the right-moving cars at speed 6: \n          car1: at turn9: [-23,-12]\n          turn10: [-23+6, -12+6] = [-17,-6]\n          turn11: [-11,0]\n          turn12: [-5,6]\n          turn13: [1,12]\n          turn14: [7,18] ... and so on.\n\n      But note: car3: (30,19,right,6) -> \n          turn9: [19,30] -> then at turn12: [19+18, 30+18] = [37,48] -> not near 0.\n\n      The car2: (-48,-59,right,6) -> \n          turn9: [-59,-48] -> turn12: [-59+18, -48+18] = [-41,-30] -> not near 0.\n\n      The car1 on freeway3: at turn13: [1,12] -> 0 not in -> then safe again.\n\n      So the cars move and then eventually leave the 0 position.\n\n  Therefore, the freeways become safe again after some turns.\n\n  We'll run the BFS until we find the goal. The minimal steps might be around 10 or 20? \n\n  We'll write the code and simulate.\n\n  However, we are doing this by hand? The problem is to do it by hand? \n\n  We are at turn9, y=2. We want minimal H.\n\n  Let me try to plan:\n\n      We need to go up 7 steps. But we might have to wait sometimes.\n\n      The main issue: freeway3 and freeway4 are dangerous at turns 11 and 12? \n\n      We saw that at turn11: freeway3 and freeway4 are unsafe (because of the car1: [-11,0] at turn11). \n\n      Similarly, freeway3 at turn12: [-5,6] -> unsafe.\n\n      freeway3 at turn13: [1,12] -> safe.\n\n      freeway4: same as freeway3? \n\n      So we might need to avoid freeway3 and freeway4 at turns 11 and 12.\n\n      How about we wait at y=2? \n\n        At turn9: y=2 -> safe.\n        turn10: if we stay at y=2 -> unsafe? because at turn10: freeway2: [-24,11] -> 0 in -> unsafe. So we cannot stay at y=2 at turn10.\n\n        We had to move: we went to y=3 at turn10.\n\n        Then at turn10: y=3 -> safe.\n\n        Then at turn11: if we go up to y=4 -> unsafe (freeway4 at turn11: unsafe). \n        if we go down to y=2 -> safe (as we saw: freeway2 at turn11: safe).\n\n        Then at turn11: we go down to y=2.\n\n        Then at turn12: we can choose: \n            up to y=3: freeway3 at turn12: unsafe? \n            down to y=1: safe? freeway1 at turn12: safe? \n            stay at y=2: safe? \n\n        Then we can go down to y=1 at turn12? or stay? \n\n        Then from y=2 at turn12, we can go up? \n\n        But we want to go to 9. \n\n        Alternatively, at turn12: we go down to y=1? Then at turn13: we can go up to y=2? but then at turn13: freeway2? \n            freeway2 at turn13: \n                car: (12,47,left,36) -> \n                    A = min(12,47)-36*(13-9)=12-144=-132\n                    B=47-144=-97 -> safe.\n\n        Then at turn13: we can go up to y=3? freeway3 at turn13: \n            car1: min(-23,-12)+6*(13-9)= -23+24=1, max(-23,-12)+24=-12+24=12 -> [1,12] -> safe.\n\n        Then we can go: \n            turn9: y=2 -> U to y=3\n            turn10: y=3 -> D to y=2\n            turn11: y=2 -> D to y=1   (then at turn12: y=1) \n            turn12: y=1 -> U to y=2\n            turn13: y=2 -> U to y=3\n            turn14: y=3 -> U to y=4 -> freeway4 at turn14: \n                freeway4: cars: \n                    car1: (-12,-23,right,6): \n                         turn14: A = min(-23,-12)+6*(14-9)= -23+30=7, B=-12+30=18 -> safe.\n                    car2: (-48,-59,right,6): \n                         A = min(-59,-48)+30 = -59+30=-29, B=-48+30=-18 -> safe.\n                    car3: (30,19,right,6): \n                         A = min(19,30)+30=19+30=49, B=30+30=60 -> safe.\n                so safe.\n\n            then turn14: y=4 -> U to y=5 -> freeway5 at turn15: \n                freeway5: car: (-12,-23,right,6) -> \n                    turn15: A = min(-23,-12)+6*(15-9)= -23+36=13, B=-12+36=24 -> safe.\n\n            then turn15: y=5 -> U to y=6 -> freeway6 at turn16: \n                freeway6: car: (-12,-23,right,6) -> \n                    turn16: A = min(-23,-12)+6*(16-9)= -23+42=19, B=-12+42=30 -> safe.\n\n            then turn16: y=6 -> U to y=7 -> freeway7 at turn17: \n                freeway7: car: (-12,-23,right,6) -> \n                    turn17: A = -23+6*8 = -23+48=25, B=-12+48=36 -> safe.\n\n            then turn17: y=7 -> U to y=8 -> freeway8 at turn18: \n                freeway8: car: (-12,-23,right,6) -> \n                    turn18: A = -23+54=31, B=-12+54=42 -> safe.\n\n            then turn18: y=8 -> U to y=9 -> goal.\n\n        Total turns: from turn9 to turn18: 9 actions? \n            actions: \n                turn9: U\n                turn10: D\n                turn11: D\n                turn12: U\n                turn13: U\n                turn14: U\n                turn15: U\n                turn16: U\n                turn18: U   -> 9 actions? but we are at turn18: that is 9 turns? \n\n        But wait: the actions are for turns: 9,10,...,17 -> 9 actions? \n\n        However, we started at turn9 and then we took 9 actions to get to turn18? \n\n        But the goal is reached at turn18: and we are at y=9. So H=9.\n\n        But is there a shorter path?\n\n        Minimal without obstacles: 7 moves (all U). \n\n        But we had to detour? \n\n        Alternatively, we could try to go up as soon as possible:\n\n          turn9: U -> y=3 (safe at turn10: freeway3 safe at turn10)\n          turn10: U -> y=4: at turn11: freeway4 -> unsafe? because freeway4 at turn11: car1: [-11,0] -> unsafe.\n\n          So we cannot go up at turn10.\n\n          Then we must avoid freeway4 at turn11. How about wait at y=3 until freeway4 is safe? \n\n          But at turn11: if we are at y=3: freeway3 at turn11: unsafe (car1: [-11,0] at turn11) -> so we cannot stay at y=3 either.\n\n          Therefore, at turn11 we must leave y=3 and y=4? \n\n          The only safe place at turn11 we found was y=2 (freeway2) and y=0 or y=9? but we are at y=3 at turn10, then at turn11 we can go to y=2,3,4.\n\n          y=2: safe, y=3: unsafe, y=4: unsafe.\n\n          So we must go to y=2 at turn11.\n\n          Then we are at the same state as before.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal path might be 9.\n\n        But wait: is there a way to avoid going down to y=1? \n\n        From turn11: at y=2 (safe), then at turn12: \n            if we go up to y=3: freeway3 at turn12: unsafe (car1: [-5,6] -> 0 in) -> unsafe.\n            if we stay at y=2: safe? \n            if we go down to y=1: safe.\n\n        Then we could stay at y=2 at turn12? \n\n        Then at turn12: y=2 -> safe (freeway2: [-96,-61] -> no 0).\n\n        Then at turn13: \n            we can go up to y=3: freeway3 at turn13: safe? \n                freeway3 at turn13: \n                    car1: min(-23,-12)+6*(13-9)= -23+24=1, max(-23,-12)+24=12 -> [1,12] -> safe.\n            so we go up to y=3.\n\n        Then:\n            turn9: U\n            turn10: D -> but wait: we were at turn9: y=2 -> U to y=3 at turn10.\n            turn11: D to y=2 at turn11.\n            turn12: S at y=2 at turn12.\n            turn13: U to y=3 at turn13.\n            turn14: U to y=4 -> safe? freeway4 at turn14: \n                car1: min(-23,-12)+6*(14-9)= -23+30=7, B= -12+30=18 -> safe.\n            then we can go up: \n                turn14: U to y=5\n                turn15: U to y=6\n                turn16: U to y=7\n                turn17: U to y=8\n                turn18: U to y=9\n\n        Total actions: 9 actions? \n            turns: 9->10: U\n                   10->11: D\n                   11->12: S\n                   12->13: U\n                   13->14: U\n                   14->15: U\n                   15->16: U\n                   16->17: U\n                   17->18: U -> 9 actions.\n\n        Same length.\n\n        But we saved one move?

That is the last action. Then at turn19 we are at y=9. \n\n  And we have 10 actions: for turns 9 to 18.\n\n  This matches.\n\n  We'll confirm one more safety: at turn18: we are at y=8 at turn18? \n      freeway8 at turn18: \n          car: (-12,-23,right,6) -> \n              A = min(-23,-12) + 6*(18-9) = -23 + 54 = 31\n              B = -12 + 54 = 42 -> [31,42] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\n  And then we move to y=9 at turn19, which is not a freeway.\n\n  So it is safe.\n\n  Therefore, this is a valid solution.\n\n  We output the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 9\\) is 10.

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 11 and player at (0,2). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nImportant: \n- The player moves vertically (y changes by +1, -1, or 0 per turn) and must be within [0,9].\n- Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway y_T (which is the row) at that turn and if there is a car on that freeway that covers the x-coordinate 0 at that same turn T.\n\nNote: When the player moves, they are on the new freeway only at the next turn. Specifically, at turn T:\n  - The player is at y_T (the row) during the entire turn T.\n  - If at turn T the action is U (or D), then at turn T+1 the player will be at y_T+1 (or y_T-1). But during turn T, the player is still at y_T.\n\nTherefore, when moving from y_T to y_T+1 at turn T (by action U), then at turn T the player is on freeway y_T and at turn T+1 on freeway y_T+1.\n\nWe must avoid collisions at every turn T from t1 (turn 11) until the turn we reach 9.\n\nThe car update:\n- Left-moving: span at time T is [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)] \n  (since t1 is the starting turn, and the car moves left, so x decreases)\n- Right-moving: span at time T is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n  (because for right-moving, the head is the rightmost? But note the input format: for right-moving, the initial span is given as (head, tail) but in the example it's (0, -11) for right? \n  Actually, the update rule for right-moving says: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So the initial head and tail are given, but note that for right-moving, the head should be the rightmost? However, the example for freeway 3: \n      (0, -11, right, 6) -> at time T, the car is [ -11 + 6*(T-t1), 0 + 6*(T-t1) ] = [ -11 + 6*(T-11), 6*(T-11) ]\n\nBut note: the car at freeway 3 at turn t1=11: \n   The car (0, -11, right, 6) at t1: the head is 0 and tail is -11? Then the car covers [-11,0] at t1? \n  Actually, the update rule for right-moving: \n      initial: [tau, h] -> [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n  So if at t1, the car is represented as (head, tail) = (0, -11) and direction right, then the initial span is [tail, head] = [-11, 0]. \n  Then at time T: [ -11 + 6*(T-11), 0 + 6*(T-11) ]\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: \n   initial (head, tail) = (-60, -25) for freeway 1: \n      initial span: [head, tail]? But the rule says: [h, tau] -> [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n      so at t1: the car is at [-60, -25]? Actually, note the rule: \"Span(t1) = [h, tau]\" for left-moving. \n      So for freeway1: [h, tau] = [-60, -25] -> then at T: [-60 - 36*(T-11), -25 - 36*(T-11)]\n\nBut note: the player is at x=0 at every turn. So we care when 0 is in the span at turn T for the freeway the player is on at T.\n\nWe are to compute for each freeway and each car, and for each turn T (>= t1) whether at turn T the car on that freeway (if present) covers x=0.\n\nWe are starting at turn 11 at y=2. We need to get to y=9.\n\nThe freeways that matter are y=1 to 8. But note: the player starts at y=2, so at turn 11 we are on freeway 2. We avoid freeway 0 and 9? Actually, the freeways with cars are 1 to 8, and the player must avoid being on a freeway that has a car at x=0 at the same turn.\n\nWe are allowed to move up, down, or stay. We must plan a sequence of actions until we reach y=9.\n\nGoal: minimal H (number of turns) and the action sequence.\n\nApproach:\nWe can use BFS (breadth-first search) over states (turn, y) and check for collisions at each step. But note: the turn numbers can be large? However, the cars move continuously, and we are only concerned with the moment when the car covers x=0. But note: the cars are moving at constant speed, so for a given car and freeway, the time intervals when x=0 is covered are periodic? Actually, we can compute for each freeway and each car the exact turns when x=0 is covered.\n\nHowever, note that the problem is over a relatively short time: we are going from y=2 to y=9, which is 7 steps up. But we might have to wait (by moving down or staying) to avoid cars. So the total turns H might be around 7 to 10? So we can simulate for a bounded horizon.\n\nBut note: the cars are moving at high speeds (like 36 and 6). The left-moving cars on freeways 1 and 2 have speed 36. The right-moving cars on freeways 3 to 8 have speed 6.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway k (1 to 8) and for each car on that freeway, the set of turns T (>= t1=11) for which 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nFor a left-moving car (d='left') on freeway k: \n   The car at time T: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n   We require: h - s*(T-t1) <= 0 <= tau - s*(T-t1)   ??? \n   But note: the car span is [head, tail] for left-moving? Actually, the rule says: \n        initial: [h, tau] and then moves left, so the entire car moves left. \n        So the span at T is [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\n   However, note that h and tau are the positions at t1. For freeway1: h=-60, tau=-25 -> so the car at t1 is at [-60, -25] (which is from -60 to -25). Since -60 < -25, the head is at -25? Actually, the representation says \"head\" and \"tail\". For left-moving, the head is the rightmost? Because as the car moves left, the head (front) is the rightmost? \n\n   But the update rule: \n        Left-moving: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n        We are told that at t1: the car is from h to tau. Since it's left-moving, the head (front) is at the right? So if h = -60 and tau = -25, then the car is from -60 (left) to -25 (right)? Then the head (front) is at -25? \n\n   However, the collision condition: we require that 0 is in [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. \n        => h - s*(T-t1) <= 0 <= tau - s*(T-t1)\n\n   But note: h = -60, tau = -25, so h < tau. So the interval [h, tau] is increasing? \n        So the condition: \n            h - s*(T-t1) <= 0 <= tau - s*(T-t1)\n        => -60 - 36*(T-11) <= 0 <= -25 - 36*(T-11)\n\n   Rearranged:\n        -60 - 36*(T-11) <= 0  -> -36*(T-11) <= 60 -> 36*(T-11) >= -60 -> which is always true for T>=11? \n        and 0 <= -25 - 36*(T-11) -> 36*(T-11) <= -25 -> which is never true for T>=11.\n\n   So this car on freeway1 never covers 0? \n\n   But wait: let me check at T=11: \n        The car is at [-60, -25] -> does it cover 0? No, because 0 is not between -60 and -25? \n\n   Similarly, for the car on freeway1: (-60, -25, left, 36) -> never covers 0 at any T>=11.\n\n   Let me check the other left-moving car on freeway2: same parameters -> also never covers 0.\n\nNow the right-moving cars: \n   Example: freeway3: (0, -11, right, 6) -> \n        At time T: [ -11 + 6*(T-11), 0 + 6*(T-11) ] = [ -11 + 6*(T-11), 6*(T-11) ]\n\n        We require: -11 + 6*(T-11) <= 0 <= 6*(T-11)\n\n        The second part: 0 <= 6*(T-11) -> T>=11 -> always true for T>=11.\n\n        The first part: -11 + 6*(T-11) <= 0 -> 6*(T-11) <= 11 -> T-11 <= 11/6 -> T-11 <= 1.833 -> so T<=12.833.\n\n        Therefore, T can be 11, 12.\n\n        At T=11: [ -11 + 0, 0 ] = [-11,0] -> covers 0? Actually, the interval is [-11,0], so it covers 0? Yes, because the car is from -11 to 0 (so 0 is included).\n\n        At T=12: [ -11 + 6, 6 ] = [-5,6] -> covers 0? Yes.\n\n        At T=13: [ -11 + 12, 12] = [1,12] -> does not cover 0.\n\n   Similarly, the other cars on freeway3 and 4: \n        (-36,-47,right,6) -> wait, the initial representation: head=-36, tail=-47? \n        But for right-moving, the initial span is [tail, head] = [-47, -36]? \n        Then at T: [ -47 + 6*(T-11), -36 + 6*(T-11) ]\n\n        Condition: -47 + 6*(T-11) <= 0 <= -36 + 6*(T-11)\n\n        The second part: 0 <= -36 + 6*(T-11) -> 6*(T-11) >= 36 -> T-11>=6 -> T>=17.\n        The first part: -47 + 6*(T-11) <= 0 -> 6*(T-11) <=47 -> T-11<=47/6≈7.83 -> T<=18.83.\n\n        So T in [17,18] (since T is integer: T=17,18).\n\n        At T=17: [-47+6*6, -36+6*6] = [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0] -> covers 0.\n        At T=18: [-47+42, -36+42] = [-5,6] -> covers 0.\n\n        The third car on freeway3 and 4: (42,31,right,6) -> \n            initial span: [tail, head] = [31,42]? But the update rule says: for right-moving, the initial span is [tau, head]? \n            The input says: (head, tail) = (42,31) -> so tau=31, head=42? Then initial span [31,42].\n            Then at T: [31+6*(T-11), 42+6*(T-11)]\n\n            Condition: 31+6*(T-11) <= 0 <= 42+6*(T-11)\n\n            The first part: 31+6*(T-11)<=0 -> 6*(T-11) <= -31 -> which is impossible for T>=11.\n\n            So this car never covers 0.\n\n   For freeway5,6,7,8: only one car: (0,-11,right,6) -> same as the first car on freeway3: it covers 0 at T=11 and T=12.\n\nTherefore, we can build a collision table for freeways and turns:\n\nFreeway 1: no collision at any turn (from the two left-moving cars? Actually, we computed the first car never covers 0, and there are two cars? But we computed both left-moving cars? Actually, freeway1 has one car: (-60,-25,left,36) -> we computed never. Similarly freeway2: same.\n\nFreeway 3: \n   car1: (0,-11,right,6): covers T=11,12.\n   car2: (-36,-47,right,6): covers T=17,18.\n   car3: (42,31,right,6): never.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway3? (same cars) -> covers T=11,12 and T=17,18.\n\nFreeway 5: only car (0,-11,right,6): covers T=11,12.\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5: T=11,12.\n\nFreeway 7: same: T=11,12.\n\nFreeway 8: same: T=11,12.\n\nBut note: freeway2 has only one car: (-60,-25,left,36) -> which we determined never covers 0? \n  Let me double-check: \n      Condition: h - s*(T-11) <= 0 <= tau - s*(T-11)\n      with h=-60, tau=-25, s=36.\n      => -60 -36*(T-11) <= 0  -> always true for T>=11? \n      and 0 <= -25 -36*(T-11) -> 36*(T-11) <= -25 -> which is impossible? \n  So freeway2 is safe.\n\nSimilarly freeway1: safe.\n\nSo summary:\n\nFreeway | Dangerous turns (T, at which x=0 is covered by at least one car)\n1: none\n2: none\n3: T=11,12,17,18\n4: T=11,12,17,18\n5: T=11,12\n6: T=11,12\n7: T=11,12\n8: T=11,12\n\nNow, we start at turn 11 at y=2.\n\nWe are at turn 11: \n   We are on freeway 2 -> which is safe (no collision at any turn). So we are safe at turn 11.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. We can move up, down, or stay.\n\nWe want minimal H. The minimal steps without waiting is 7 moves up: \n   from y=2 to y=9: 7 steps.\n\nBut we have to avoid collisions on freeways 3 to 8 at dangerous turns.\n\nPlan:\n\nWe can simulate the moves. We start at (turn=11, y=2). We are safe at turn11 because we are on freeway2 (safe).\n\nOur goal: y=9.\n\nWe consider the moves:\n\nWe are going to consider the next turns. Note that at each turn, we choose an action (U, D, S) and then the next state is (turn+1, y+1, y, or y-1) and we check if at that next turn the new y (if we moved) is safe? Actually, we must check at every turn the current freeway at that turn.\n\nSpecifically, at turn T, we are at y_T. We must check that if the freeway y_T is dangerous at turn T, then we cannot be there? But note: if the freeway is dangerous at turn T, then if we are on that freeway at turn T we collide.\n\nSo at turn T, we must be at a freeway that is not dangerous at turn T.\n\nWe are at turn11: T=11, y=2 -> freeway2 (safe) -> ok.\n\nNext turn: T=12, we choose an action at turn11 that will determine y12.\n\nWe can choose:\n  U: then y12 = 2+1 = 3 -> freeway3 at turn12 -> dangerous? freeway3 at turn12 is dangerous (because T=12 is dangerous for freeway3) -> collision.\n  D: then y12 = 1 -> freeway1: safe (no danger) -> ok.\n  S: then y12=2 -> freeway2: safe -> ok.\n\nBut we want to go up. So we must avoid freeway3 at turn12.\n\nOne option: at turn11, we do not go up. We either go down to 1 or stay at 2.\n\nBut if we go down to 1 at turn12, then at turn12 we are on freeway1 (safe). Then at turn12 we can choose to go up to 2 (freeway2 at turn13) or even to freeway2? \n\nBut note: we are at turn12: \n   Action at turn12: \n      If we are at y=1 (freeway1) at turn12, then we can choose U: then at turn13 we will be at y=2 (freeway2 at turn13) -> freeway2 is safe at any turn, so safe.\n\nBut we need to get to 9. Alternatively, we can wait until the dangerous period for freeway3 is over? But freeway3 is dangerous at T=11,12 and then again at 17,18. So at T=13, freeway3 is safe? \n\nYes, because for freeway3 the dangerous turns are 11,12,17,18. So at T=13,14,15,16,19,... freeway3 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway4: same dangerous turns: 11,12,17,18.\n\nFreeways 5-8: only dangerous at 11,12. So at T=13 and beyond, freeways 5-8 are safe.\n\nTherefore, we can try:\n\nOption 1: wait at freeway2 until T=13? \n   Turn11: S -> at turn12: y=2 (freeway2, safe at T=12) \n   Turn12: U -> at turn13: y=3 (freeway3 at turn13: safe because T=13 is not dangerous for freeway3) -> then we can proceed.\n\nThen from y=3 at turn13, we can go up: \n   Turn13: U -> y=4 at turn14: freeway4 at turn14: safe? freeway4 dangerous at 11,12,17,18 -> turn14 is safe.\n   Turn14: U -> y=5 at turn15: freeway5 at turn15: safe (since freeway5 only dangerous at 11,12) -> safe.\n   Turn15: U -> y=6 at turn16: freeway6 at turn16: safe.\n   Turn16: U -> y=7 at turn17: freeway7 at turn17: dangerous? freeway7 only dangerous at 11,12 -> safe at 17? \n        But wait: freeway7: dangerous at T=11,12 -> so at T=17: safe. \n        However, note that freeway7 has the same car as freeway5: (0,-11,right,6) -> which we computed only at T=11,12. So yes, safe.\n   Turn17: U -> y=8 at turn18: freeway8 at turn18: dangerous? freeway8 dangerous at T=11,12 -> safe at 18? \n        But wait: freeway8: same as freeway5: dangerous at 11,12 -> so safe at 18.\n   Turn18: U -> y=9 at turn19: goal.\n\nBut note: when we reach y=9 at turn19, we are done? The condition is that at the last turn (turn19) we are at (0,9). And we do not care about cars at freeway9? There are no freeways above 8? And the goal is freeway9? But the cars are only on freeways 1-8. So freeway9 is safe.\n\nSo the sequence: \n   Turn11: S  (stay at y=2)\n   Turn12: U  (to y=3 at turn13)\n   Turn13: U  (to y=4 at turn14)\n   Turn14: U  (to y=5 at turn15)\n   Turn15: U  (to y=6 at turn16)\n   Turn16: U  (to y=7 at turn17)\n   Turn17: U  (to y=8 at turn18)\n   Turn18: U  (to y=9 at turn19)\n\nTotal turns: 8 (from turn11 to turn18, then at turn19 we are at 9). But note: we start at turn11 at y=2. Then we take 7 actions (from turn11 to turn17) to get to y=9 at turn18? \n\nWait: \n   At turn11: we do action S -> at the beginning of turn12 we are still at y=2? \n   Actually, the update: \n        At turn t, we do action a_t, then at the next turn (t+1) we update the position.\n\n   So: \n        Turn11: action S -> then at turn12, y12 = y11 + 0 = 2.\n        Turn12: action U -> then at turn13, y13 = 2+1 = 3.\n        ...\n        Turn18: action U -> then at turn19, y19 = 8+1 = 9.\n\n   So we use 8 actions (from turn11 to turn18) and at turn19 we are at y=9. Therefore, H=8? \n\n   But note: the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then we reach at turn t1+H-1 the goal? \n\n        We start at turn t1 = 11.\n        We take actions at t=0 to t=H-1: \n            t=0: turn11\n            t=1: turn12\n            ...\n            t=H-1: turn11+H-1\n\n        And we require that at turn t1+H-1, the player is at (0,9).\n\n        At the last action (at turn11+H-1) we do an action that results in y=9 at the next turn? But the problem says: \n            y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta\n            and we are at (0,9) at the turn after the last action? \n\n        Actually, the sequence of actions is from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1. Then after the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we are at the next turn (turn t1+H) at position (0,9). \n\n        But the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"? \n\n        Let me read: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\". And then the player update: \n            y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\n        So after the last action (at turn t1+H-1), the next state is at turn t1+H. But the problem says \"reach (0,9)\" at the turn after the last action? \n\n        Actually, the problem states: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence ... such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\n        Wait: it says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\n        So the player is at (0,9) at the turn t1+H-1.\n\n        How does that work?\n\n        We start at turn t1: y_{t1}=2.\n        Then we do action a_{t1}: then at turn t1+1: y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Delta.\n        We do actions until we have done H actions? \n\n        The sequence is from t=0 to H-1: that is, we do actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then the state at turn t1+H is determined by the last action? \n\n        But the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\n        That means: at the turn when we take the last action (turn t1+H-1) we are already at y=9? \n\n        But note: the action at turn t1+H-1 is taken at state (turn t1+H-1, y_{t1+H-1}). Then we update to y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Delta.\n\n        However, the problem says we must be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\n        Actually, rereading: \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\" and the player update is defined for the next turn. \n\n        But the condition is: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\n        So we must be at y=9 at the turn when we take the last action? \n\n        Then the last action is taken at a state where y is already 9? That doesn't make sense because then we would have reached at the previous turn.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem might mean that after the last action, we are at y=9 at the next turn? \n\n        But the problem explicitly says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\n        Let me check the problem statement: \n            \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\n        So it is: at the turn t1+H-1, the player is at y=9.\n\n        How do we achieve that? \n\n        We start at turn t1: y_{t1} = 2.\n\n        Then we do H-1 actions? Actually, the sequence has H actions: t from 0 to H-1 -> H actions.\n\n        But the state at turn t1 is before any action? Then we do action at turn t1: that updates the state to turn t1+1? \n\n        Actually, the player update: \n            at turn t: we are at y_t, then we choose a_t, then we get y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta.\n\n        Therefore, the state at turn t1 is given (y_{t1}=2). \n        Then we do an action a_{t1} -> then we get y_{t1+1}.\n        Then we do a_{t1+1} at turn t1+1 -> then we get y_{t1+2}.\n        ... until we do a_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1 -> then we get y_{t1+H}.\n\n        But the condition is that at turn t1+H-1 we are at y=9? \n\n        That would be the state before the last action? Then we don't care about the state after the last action? \n\n        Actually, the condition is: we must have y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n        So we must be at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? Then we can choose an arbitrary action at that turn? But the goal is to be at (0,9) at that turn. \n\n        However, note: the collision condition: we must avoid collisions at every turn from t1 to t1+H-1? \n\n        Because the problem says: \"avoid collisions with cars ... during the sequence\".\n\n        So at turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9? And freeway9 has no cars? So safe.\n\n        How do we get to y=9 at turn t1+H-1? \n\n        We have 7 steps to go: from 2 to 9: 7 moves up. \n\n        So we need 7 actions? Then H=7? \n\n        Then the sequence: \n            Turn11: U -> at turn12: y=3\n            Turn12: U -> at turn13: y=4\n            Turn13: U -> at turn14: y=5\n            Turn14: U -> at turn15: y=6\n            Turn15: U -> at turn16: y=7\n            Turn16: U -> at turn17: y=8\n            Turn17: U -> at turn18: y=9\n\n        Then at turn18 (which is t1+7-1 = 11+7-1 = 17? Wait: \n            H=7: \n                t from 0 to 6: \n                    t=0: turn11 -> action U -> at turn12: y=3\n                    t=1: turn12 -> action U -> at turn13: y=4\n                    ...\n                    t=6: turn16 -> action U -> at turn17: y=9? \n                Then at turn17 (which is t1+6) we are at y=9? But we require at turn t1+H-1 = 11+7-1 = 17 to be at y=9 -> yes.\n\n        So the last action is at turn16 (t1+6) and we get to y=9 at turn17.\n\n        But wait: we started at turn11: y=2.\n        Then at turn11: we do U -> so at turn12: y=3 -> but we must check collision at turn12: we are at freeway3? -> dangerous at turn12 -> collision.\n\n        So we cannot do the direct 7-step plan.\n\n        Therefore, we need to avoid freeway3 at turn12.\n\n        How about if we wait one turn? \n\n        Plan with H=8? \n          Then we require at turn t1+8-1 = 18 to be at y=9.\n\n          We can do:\n            Turn11: S -> then at turn12: y=2 (safe at freeway2)\n            Turn12: U -> then at turn13: y=3 (freeway3 at turn13: safe)\n            Turn13: U -> turn14: y=4 (freeway4 at turn14: safe)\n            Turn14: U -> turn15: y=5 (freeway5 at turn15: safe)\n            Turn15: U -> turn16: y=6 (freeway6 at turn16: safe)\n            Turn16: U -> turn17: y=7 (freeway7 at turn17: safe)\n            Turn17: U -> turn18: y=8 (freeway8 at turn18: safe? freeway8 dangerous at 11,12 only -> safe)\n            Turn18: U -> then at turn19: y=9 -> but we don't need to be at y=9 at turn19? \n\n          But we require at turn18 (t1+7) to be at y=9? We are at y=8 at turn18.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n            ... \n            Turn17: U -> then at turn18: y=8 -> then we are at y=8 at turn18, not 9.\n\n          How to get to 9 at turn18? \n\n          We must be at y=9 at the beginning of turn18? \n\n          So we must have arrived at y=9 by the action at turn17? \n\n          That is: \n            At turn17: we are at y=8? Then we do U -> then at turn18: y=9 -> so at turn18 we are at y=9. \n\n          But the condition is that at turn18 (which is t1+7) we are at y=9? \n\n          Actually, the state at turn18 is after the action at turn17. \n\n          How the state evolves:\n\n          We have:\n            Turn t: state is (y_t) -> then we do action a_t -> then we get y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta.\n\n          Therefore, the state at turn t is the state before the action at turn t.\n\n          And the condition is: at turn t1+H-1, we have y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n          So at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9? Then we don't have to do any action that turn? \n\n          But the sequence of actions includes an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\n          The sequence: t from 0 to H-1: \n             t=0: turn t1\n             t=1: turn t1+1\n             ...\n             t=H-1: turn t1+H-1\n\n          So we do an action at turn t1+H-1. \n\n          Then we get y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Delta.\n\n          But we don't care about that? We only care that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at y=9? \n\n          However, note: at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}. Then we do an action. \n\n          The collision condition: at turn t1+H-1, we are at freeway y_{t1+H-1}. We must be safe at that turn.\n\n          So if we are at y=9 at turn t1+H-1, then we are safe (since freeway9 has no cars). Then we can do any action? But the goal is to be at (0,9) at that turn? \n\n          The problem: \"reach (0,9)\" -> meaning the position is (0,9) at that turn.\n\n          So we must be at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\n          How do we get there? \n\n          We must have arrived at y=9 by the action at turn t1+H-2? \n\n          Example: \n            To be at y=9 at turn18: \n                We must have been at y=8 at turn17, and then at turn17 we do U -> then at turn18 we become y=9. \n                But at the beginning of turn18, we are at y=9? \n\n          Actually, no: \n            At the beginning of turn17: we are at y=8.\n            Then we do U at turn17 -> then we set y18 = 8+1 = 9.\n\n          Then at the beginning of turn18: we are at y=9.\n\n          So the state at the beginning of turn18 is y=9.\n\n          Therefore, we require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at y=9.\n\n          So we need to plan so that the last action (at turn t1+H-2) brings us to y=9 at the next state (which is the beginning of turn t1+H-1).\n\n          And then we do an action at turn t1+H-1? But we are already at the goal? \n\n          The problem requires a sequence of H actions? \n\n          And we must avoid collisions at every turn from t1 to t1+H-1? \n\n          At turn t1+H-1: we are at y=9 -> safe. Then we can do any action? But it doesn't matter as long as we are at the goal at the beginning of that turn.\n\n          However, the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1. So we are at (0,9) at the beginning of that turn. Then we do an action? \n\n          But note: the goal condition is satisfied at the beginning of the turn. The action we do at that turn might move us away? But the problem doesn't require to stay? It only requires to reach at turn t1+H-1.\n\n          So we can do any action at the last turn? \n\n          But to minimize H, we don't want to do an extra action? \n\n          Actually, we can stop at the moment we reach. However, the problem requires a sequence of exactly H actions? \n\n          And H is the minimal number of turns? \n\n          Let me see: \n            We start at turn t1 (11) at y=2.\n            We want to be at y=9 at the beginning of some turn T.\n\n            The minimal T is turn 18? Because we need 7 moves up, and we have to avoid the first two turns on freeway3.\n\n          How? \n            We can do:\n                Turn11: S -> then at turn12: y=2 (safe)\n                Turn12: U -> then at turn13: y=3 (safe)\n                Turn13: U -> then at turn14: y=4 (safe)\n                Turn14: U -> then at turn15: y=5 (safe)\n                Turn15: U -> then at turn16: y=6 (safe)\n                Turn16: U -> then at turn17: y=7 (safe)\n                Turn17: U -> then at turn18: y=8 -> at the beginning of turn18: y=8 -> not 9.\n\n          We need one more up: \n                Turn18: U -> then at turn19: y=9 -> then at the beginning of turn19: y=9.\n\n          Then we require T = turn19 to be at y=9.\n\n          Then H: we did actions at turn11,12,...,18: that's 8 actions? \n          Then H=8, and we require at turn t1+H-1 = 11+8-1 = 18 -> but at turn18 we are at y=8, not 9.\n\n          Actually, we require to be at y=9 at turn t1+H-1 = 18? -> we are not.\n\n          How do we relate H and the turn number? \n\n          We do H actions: at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\n          Then the state at the beginning of turn t1 is given.\n          After the first action (at turn t1) we get to turn t1+1: state y_{t1+1}.\n          ...\n          After the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we get to turn t1+H: state y_{t1+H}.\n\n          But the problem says: we must have y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n          That is: the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 must be 9.\n\n          How do we achieve that? \n\n          We must have by the action at turn t1+H-2 we set y_{t1+H-1} = 9? \n\n          Actually, the action at turn t1+H-2 updates the state from the beginning of turn t1+H-2 to the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\n          So: \n            y_{t1+H-1} = y_{t1+H-2} + Delta_{t1+H-2}\n\n          Therefore, to have y_{t1+H-1}=9, we must have at the beginning of turn t1+H-2 been at y_{t1+H-2} and then we choose an action that gives Delta such that y_{t1+H-2} + Delta = 9.\n\n          And then at turn t1+H-1, we are at 9.\n\n          Then we also do an action at turn t1+H-1? But that action might change the state? \n\n          However, the condition only requires that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. The action at that turn is taken after, and then we go to y_{t1+H} = 9 + Delta, but we don't care as long as we have been at 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\n          So we must do H actions? \n\n          How many actions to get from y=2 to y=9? \n            We need 7 net up moves. But we might have to move down or stay to avoid.\n\n          The minimal H: the minimal number of turns (actions) to achieve being at y=9 at the beginning of some turn.\n\n          We start at turn11: y=2.\n\n          We want to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn T.\n\n          The earliest T: \n             If we go up every time: \n                 Turn11: U -> turn12: y=3\n                 Turn12: U -> turn13: y=4\n                 Turn13: U -> turn14: y=5\n                 Turn14: U -> turn15: y=6\n                 Turn15: U -> turn16: y=7\n                 Turn16: U -> turn17: y=8\n                 Turn17: U -> turn18: y=9\n\n          So at the beginning of turn18: y=9.\n\n          How many actions? from turn11 to turn17: 7 actions.\n\n          Then H=7, and we require y_{t1+H-1}=y_{11+7-1}=y_{17}=9? -> yes.\n\n          But at turn12: we are at y=3 -> freeway3 at turn12: dangerous -> collision.\n\n          So we cannot do 7 actions.\n\n          Next: we try to avoid by waiting one turn at the beginning:\n\n             Turn11: S -> turn12: y=2 (safe)\n             Turn12: U -> turn13: y=3 (safe, because freeway3 at turn13 is safe)\n             Turn13: U -> turn14: y=4 (freeway4 at turn14: safe)\n             Turn14: U -> turn15: y=5 (safe)\n             Turn15: U -> turn16: y=6 (safe)\n             Turn16: U -> turn17: y=7 (safe)\n             Turn17: U -> turn18: y=8 -> not 9.\n\n          We need one more:\n\n             Turn18: U -> turn19: y=9.\n\n          Then at turn19: y=9.\n\n          How many actions? 8 actions: at turns11,12,...,18.\n\n          Then H=8, and we require y_{t1+H-1}=y_{11+8-1}=y_{18}=? \n             At the beginning of turn18: y=8 -> not 9.\n\n          What's the state at turn19? That's the state after the last action (at turn18). \n\n          We require the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 = turn18 to be 9 -> but it's 8.\n\n          How to have y=9 at the beginning of turn18? \n             We must have been at y=8 at the beginning of turn17, and then done U at turn17 to get to y=9 at turn18.\n\n          But then the last action is at turn17? \n\n          And we would have done 7 actions: \n               turns: 11,12,13,14,15,16,17 -> 7 actions.\n\n          Then H=7, and we require y_{17}=9? \n\n          How do we get to y=9 at turn17 (the beginning of turn17) with 7 actions? \n             The actions are at turn11 to turn16? \n             Then the state after the last action (at turn16) is turn17: y_17 = ... \n\n          Let me simulate:\n\n             Start: turn11: y11=2.\n             Action at turn11: ? \n             ...\n             Action at turn16: ... -> then we get y17.\n\n          We need y17=9.\n\n          The moves: \n             We need 7 moves up? \n                But from turn11 to turn16: 6 actions.\n\n          So we cannot get 7 moves in 6 actions.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n             We need to gain 7 in y. Each U gives +1, D gives -1, S gives 0.\n\n          Let the number of U, D, S be such that: U - D = 7, and U+D+S = H-1? \n\n          Actually, we do H actions? \n\n          But the state at turn t1+H-1 is after H-1 state updates? \n\n          We start at turn11: state y11=2.\n          After action at turn11: state at turn12: y12 = 2 + Delta11.\n          ...\n          After action at turn11+H-2: state at turn11+H-1: y_{11+H-1} = 2 + (number of U - number of D) from the H-1 actions.\n\n          We require y_{11+H-1}=9 -> 2 + (U - D) = 9 -> U - D = 7.\n\n          And the total actions: U+D+S = H.\n\n          But note: we are doing H actions? Or H-1 actions? \n\n          The sequence is for t=0 to H-1: H actions. And they are applied at turns t1 to t1+H-1, and they update the state to turns t1+1 to t1+H.\n\n          But we care about the state at turn t1+H-1, which is before the last action? \n\n          Actually, turn t1+H-1: before the last action, the state is y_{t1+H-1}. Then we do the last action to get to y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Delta.\n\n          But the condition is y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\n          So the last action is not used to get to 9, but we are already at 9 at the beginning of that turn.\n\n          Therefore, the net moves from the first H-1 actions must be 7: \n               2 + (U' - D') = 9, where U' and D' are the counts from the first H-1 actions.\n\n          And then the last action can be anything? But we have to do it? \n\n          And we require that during the first H-1 actions, we never had a collision? \n\n          Also, during the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we are at freeway9 (safe) so no collision.\n\n          So the minimal H: \n             We need at least 7 net up moves, so the first H-1 actions must include at least 7 U and at least 0 D? But we can have D if we compensate with more U? \n\n          The minimal number of actions to achieve 7 net up moves is 7 actions: all U. But we saw that we cannot do that because of collision at turn12.\n\n          Next: we can do 8 actions: then the first 7 actions must achieve a net of 7? \n             U' - D' = 7, and we have 7 actions -> then U'=7, D'=0, S'=0 -> the same as the 7 U's.\n\n          Or 9 actions: then the first 8 actions must achieve net 7: then we can have 7 U and 1 S, or 8 U and 1 D? \n\n          But we want minimal H.\n\n          Alternatively, we can try to use a detour? \n\n          But note: freeways 1 and 2 are safe at all turns. So we can go down to freeway1 and then up.\n\n          How about:\n\n            Turn11: D -> then at turn12: y=1 (freeway1: safe)\n            Turn12: U -> then at turn13: y=2 (freeway2: safe)\n            Turn13: U -> then at turn14: y=3 (freeway3: safe at turn14)\n            Turn14: U -> y=4 (freeway4: safe at turn14)\n            Turn15: U -> y=5 (safe)\n            Turn16: U -> y=6 (safe)\n            Turn17: U -> y=7 (safe)\n            Turn18: U -> y=8 (safe)\n            Turn19: U -> y=9 -> then at turn19: y=9.\n\n          But we require at turn t1+H-1 to be at y=9. \n\n          We did 8 actions: from turn11 to turn18? \n             Then turn t1+H-1 = 11+8-1 = 18: we are at y=8 at the beginning of turn18, then we do U to get to y=9 at turn19.\n\n          But we are not at y=9 at turn18.\n\n          How to be at y=9 at turn18? \n             We would have to been at y=8 at turn17, and then done U at turn17 to get to y=9 at turn18.\n\n          Then the actions would be: \n             Turn11: D -> turn12: y=1\n             Turn12: U -> turn13: y=2\n             Turn13: U -> turn14: y=3\n             Turn14: U -> turn15: y=4\n             Turn15: U -> turn16: y=5\n             Turn16: U -> turn17: y=6 -> then at turn17: we are at y=6, and we do U -> turn18: y=7 -> not 9.\n\n          This is not enough.\n\n          We need two more U's.\n\n          So with this detour, we use 2 extra actions (the down and then up) and then we need 7 ups: total actions=9.\n\n          Then H=9: \n                actions at turn11 to turn19-1 = turn19? -> not.\n\n          Let me count: \n            actions: turn11,12,..., turn19-1+1? \n\n          We do 9 actions: turns 11 to 19? \n\n          Then turn t1+H-1 = 11+9-1 = 19: we require y_{19}=9.\n\n          How to achieve y_{19}=9 with 9 actions (the first 8 actions must give net 7 ups) -> then the 8 actions: net 7 ups means 7 ups and 1 down, or 8 ups and 1 down? net=7.\n\n          In the above, we did: \n             D, U, U, U, U, U, U, U -> net: -1+7 = 6 -> not 7.\n\n          We need an extra up somewhere.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n             Turn11: D (y12=1)\n             Turn12: U (y13=2)\n             Turn13: U (y14=3)\n             Turn14: U (y15=4)\n             Turn15: U (y16=5)\n             Turn16: U (y17=6)\n             Turn17: U (y18=7)\n             Turn18: U (y19=8)\n             Turn19: U (y20=9) -> then at turn20: y=9.\n\n          Then to have y19=9, we would have to been at y=8 at turn18 and then done U at turn18 to get to y=9 at turn19.\n\n          So the first 8 actions (turn11 to turn18) must get us to y=8 at turn19? -> no, they get us to y=8 at turn19? \n\n          Actually, we are at y=8 at turn19 (beginning of turn19) -> then we do U at turn19 to get to y=9 at turn20.\n\n          So to have y19=9, we need the first 8 actions to have net 7: so that at turn19 (which is after 8 actions) we have y19=2+7=9.\n\n          How? \n             We start at 2.\n             We do 8 actions: net = U - D = 7.\n             So we need 7 more ups than downs.\n\n          For example: 7 ups and 0 downs and 1 stay: net=7.\n          or 8 ups and 1 down: net=7.\n\n          But we have to avoid collisions.\n\n          Let me try with 7 ups and 1 stay:\n\n             We need to distribute the actions.\n\n          We know that at turn12, we cannot be on freeway3.\n\n          One plan:\n\n             Turn11: S (y12=2) -> safe (freeway2)\n             Turn12: S (y13=2) -> safe\n             Turn13: U (y14=3) -> freeway3 at turn14? -> turn14: freeway3: dangerous? freeway3 dangerous at turn14? -> no, only 11,12,17,18. safe.\n             Turn14: U (y15=4) -> freeway4 at turn15? -> turn15: freeway4: dangerous at 17,18? turn15 is safe.\n             Turn15: U (y16=5) -> safe\n             Turn16: U (y17=6) -> safe\n             Turn17: ? \n\n          But at turn17: freeway7 is safe? yes. freeway6 at turn17: safe.\n\n          We need to get to 9 by turn19 (beginning of turn19) -> so after 8 actions we should be at 9.\n\n          Currently after turn16: y17=6.\n\n          We need: \n             Turn17: must gain 3 -> but we have two actions left: turn17 and turn18.\n\n          So turn17: U (y18=7)\n          Turn18: U (y19=8) -> not 9.\n\n          We are at 8 at turn19.\n\n          So not enough.\n\n          Try with an extra up somewhere:\n\n             Turn11: U (y12=3) -> collision at turn12: freeway3 at turn12 is dangerous -> not allowed.\n\n          Try:\n\n             Turn11: S (y12=2)\n             Turn12: U (y13=3) -> safe (turn13: freeway3 safe)\n             Turn13: U (y14=4)\n             Turn14: U (y15=5)\n             Turn15: U (y16=6)\n             Turn16: U (y17=7)\n             Turn17: U (y18=8)\n             Turn18: U (y19=9) -> then at turn19: we are at 9.\n\n          This is 8 actions: \n             actions at turn11 to turn18.\n\n          Then H=8, and we require y_{t1+H-1}=y_{11+8-1}=y_{18}=9? \n             At the beginning of turn18: we are at y=8 (because the action at turn18 hasn't been done yet) -> then we do U at turn18 and then at turn19 we are at 9.\n\n          But the state at the beginning of turn18 is 8, not 9.\n\n          How to be at 9 at the beginning of turn18? \n             We must have been at 8 at turn17 and then done U at turn17 to get to 9 at turn18.\n\n          Then the actions would be:\n\n             Turn11: S (y12=2)\n             Turn12: U (y13=3)\n             Turn13: U (y14=4)\n             Turn14: U (y15=5)\n             Turn15: U (y16=6)\n             Turn16: U (y17=7)\n             Turn17: U (y18=9) -> wait, from 7 to 9 in one action? not possible.\n\n          So we need to be at 8 at turn17.\n\n          then:\n             Turn11: S (y12=2)\n             Turn12: U (y13=3)\n             Turn13: U (y14=4)\n             Turn14: U (y15=5)\n             Turn15: U (y16=6)\n             Turn16: U (y17=7)\n             Turn17: cannot do U because that would make y18=8, not 9.\n\n          We must have more moves earlier.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do a down move somewhere to allow more ups later? \n\n          But that would require more actions.\n\n          Given the constraints, the earliest we can be at y=9 is at turn18 if we do:\n\n             Turn11: S (y12=2)\n             Turn12: U (y13=3)\n             Turn13: U (y14=4)\n             Turn14: U (y15=5)\n             Turn15: U (y16=6)\n             Turn16: U (y17=7)\n             Turn17: U (y18=8)\n             Turn18: we are at y=8 at the beginning, then we do U to get to y=9 at turn19.\n\n          To have y18=9, we would need to have done 7 net ups in the first 7 actions (turn11 to turn17) -> \n             net = 7, so in 7 actions: let the net be 7, so no down, only ups and possibly stays? \n                 but we have to do 7 ups in 7 actions -> that's the direct path, which collides at turn12.\n\n          So we must have at least one extra action to avoid.\n\n          Therefore, the earliest we can be at y=9 is turn19.\n\n          Then we require: at turn19: y=9.\n          This is at the beginning of turn19.\n\n          How many actions? from turn11 to turn18: 8 actions.\n\n          Then H=8, and we require at turn t1+H-1 = 11+8-1 = 18: y_{18}=9? -> no, we are at y=8 at turn18, and then we do U at turn18 to get to y=9 at turn19.\n\n          So we are at y=8 at turn18.\n\n          Therefore, to have y_{18}=9, we must achieve it in 7 actions: \n\n          We must have a path that in 7 actions (first 7 actions) nets 7 ups, and avoids collisions.\n\n          But we see that the direct path has a collision at turn12.\n\n          Is there a path that in 7 actions nets 7 ups and avoids all collisions? \n             actions: turn11 to turn17.\n             states: \n                 turn11: y=2.\n                 turn12: must be safe: cannot be on freeway3 or freeway4 or freeway5,6,7,8 at turn12? freeway3,4,5,6,7,8 are dangerous at turn12.\n\n          The only safe freeways at turn12 are 1 and 2.\n\n          So at turn12, we must be at y=1 or y=2.\n\n          How to be at y=1 or y=2 at turn12? \n             from y=2 at turn11: \n                 if we do S: then turn12: y=2 (safe)\n                 if we do D: then turn12: y=1 (safe)\n                 if we do U: then turn12: y=3 (unsafe) -> not allowed.\n\n          Then at turn12, we are at 1 or 2.\n\n          Then we need to get to 9 in 5 more actions (actions at turn12 to turn17) -> net 7-0 = 7, but we are behind: \n             if we are at 2 at turn12, then we need 7 ups in 5 actions -> net 5 (if we do 5 ups) -> then we get to 2+5=7 at turn17.\n             if we are at 1 at turn12, then we need 8 ups in 5 actions -> net 5 -> 1+5=6.\n\n          We cannot.\n\n          Therefore, we must use more than 7 actions.\n\n          Minimal H is 8, and we will be at y=9 at turn19.\n\n          Then we require: at turn18 ( the turn t1+8-1=18) we are at y=9? -> no, we are at y=8.\n\n          But the problem requires at turn18 to be at 9? \n\n          We must therefore be at 9 at the beginning of turn18.\n\n          To be at 9 at turn18, we must have been at 8 at turn17 and done U at turn17.\n\n          So with 8 actions, the first 7 actions must net 7 ups? \n\n          We do 7 actions ( turn11 to turn17) and then the state at turn18 is 9.\n\n          How to net 7 ups in 7 actions while avoiding? \n\n          We have to avoid being on freeway3,4,5,6,7,8 at turn12 ( because turn12 is dangerous for these) and also avoid freeway3,4 at turn17 and turn18 ( because they are dangerous at 17,18) and freeway3,4 are dangerous at 17 and 18.\n\n          freeway3 and 4 are dangerous at T=17,18.\n\n          So at turn17, we cannot be on freeway3 or 4.\n          at turn18, we cannot be on freeway3 or 4.\n\n          But note: at turn17: if we are on freeway3 or 4 and do U, then at turn18 we would be on freeway4 or 5. \n\n          But at the beginning of turn17, we are on freeway y17, and then we do an action.\n\n          To achieve 7 net ups in 7 actions, we must do exactly 7 ups and 0 downs.\n\n          Let's try to avoid the collisions by taking a different route.\n\n          We must be at turn12 on a safe freeway: 1 or 2.\n\n          then at turn12: \n             if we are at 1: then we can do U ( to 2) at turn12.\n             if we are at 2: then we can do U ( to 3) at turn12? -> but turn13: we would be on freeway3 at turn13: safe, because freeway3 dangerous only at 11,12,17,18.\n\n          So from turn12 at 2: we can do U to 3 at turn13.\n\n          then:\n             turn11: to avoid being at 3 at turn12, we must do S or D.\n             turn11: S -> turn12: 2.\n             turn12: U -> turn13: 3 (safe, because turn13 is safe for freeway3)\n             turn13: U -> turn14: 4 ( freeway4 at turn14: safe)\n             turn14: U -> turn15: 5 (safe)\n             turn15: U -> turn16: 6 (safe)\n             turn16: U -> turn17: 7 (safe)\n             turn17: U -> turn18: 8.\n\n          Then at turn18: we are at 8, not 9.\n\n          We need to be at 9 at turn18.\n\n          So we must do an extra U somewhere.\n\n          But we are at 2 at turn12, and we do 6 Ups from turn12 to turn17: then we get to 2+6=8 at turn18.\n\n          To get to 9, we need to do 7 Ups in the 7 actions? \n\n          How about if we do a double up somewhere? not possible.\n\n          then we must have been at a higher value at turn12.\n\n          The only safe freeway at turn12 is 1 or 2.\n\n          So we cannot be at 3 at turn12.\n\n          Therefore, it's impossible to net 7 ups in 7 actions without being at an unsafe freeway at turn12.\n\n          So we must use 8 actions for the net 7 ups, meaning we will have one extra action (probably a stay) and we will reach at turn19.\n\n          Then we require at turn18 to be at 9? but we will be at 9 at turn19.\n\n          The problem: we must be at 9 at turn t1+H-1 = 11+8-1=18.\n\n          So we must find a way to be at 9 at turn18.\n\n          How? \n\n          We must have in the first 7 actions (at turns11 to turn17) net 7 ups.\n\n          We can try to for example be at safe freeways at all turns and net 7 ups in 7 actions.\n\n          The only problem is turn12.\n\n          What if we do at turn11: D ( to 1 at turn12) -> safe.\n          then at turn12: we must do U ( to 2 at turn13) \n          then at turn13: U ( to 3 at turn14) \n          then at turn14: U ( to 4 at turn15) \n          then at turn15: U ( to 5 at turn16) \n          then at turn16: U ( to 6 at turn17) \n          then at turn17: U ( to 7 at turn18) \n\n          net: from 2 to 7: only 5 ups, not 7.\n\n          We need to insert two more ups somewhere, but then we would have to do more than 7 actions.\n\n          Therefore, we must use 8 actions and forgo the requirement to be at 9 at turn18. \n\n          But the problem requires it.\n\n          I see the confusion: the problem says: \" the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\n          So if we cannot do it in 7 actions, and we found that in 8 actions we can be at 9 at turn19, then we would require to be at 9 at turn18 ( which is t1+7) -> but we are at 8.\n\n          What if we do 8 actions and are at 9 at turn19, then we would require a different H.\n\n          Let me calculate for the safe sequence we have:\n\n          Sequence: \n            turn11: S\n            turn12: U\n            turn13: U\n            turn14: U\n            turn15: U\n            turn16: U\n            turn17: U\n            turn18: U\n\n          Then states:\n             turn11: y=2 ( given)\n             turn12: y=2 ( after action S at turn11)\n             turn13: y=3 ( after action U at turn12)\n             turn14: y=4\n             turn15: y=5\n             turn16: y=6\n             turn17: y=7\n             turn18: y=8\n             turn19: y=9 ( after action U at turn18)\n\n          So at turn19: we are at y=9.\n\n          The last action is at turn18.\n\n          How many actions? 8.\n\n          Then H=8, and we require at turn t1+H-1 = 11+8-1 = 18 to be at y=9 -> but at turn18 we are at y=8.\n\n          So it does not satisfy.\n\n          Unless we consider that the state at turn18 is after the action at turn17? and before the action at turn18.\n\n          But the action at turn18 is the last action (indexed by t=7 in the sequence).\n\n          then the state at turn18 ( before the action) is 8, and then we do U and then we are at 9 at turn19.\n\n          So to have the state at turn18 being 9, we need a different sequence.\n\n          How about if we do an extra U earlier? \n\n          We can try to do two U's in a row at some safe point to catch up.\n\n          For example, at turn11: we cannot do U because of turn12.\n\n          turn12: we can only do from safe freeways 1 or 2.\n\n          turn13: we can do from 2 or 3.\n\n          We are at turn12: y=2 ( if we did S at turn11) or 1 ( if we did D at turn11).\n\n          Then at turn12: if we are at 2, we can do U to 3 at turn13.\n          Then at turn13: we are at 3, and we can do U to 4 at turn14.\n          ...\n\n          We are one behind.\n\n          to catch up, we need to be at 3 at turn12, but we can't because turn12: freeway3 is dangerous.\n\n          Therefore, we must be at 2 at turn12, and then at turn13: 3, and then continue.\n\n          and we will be at 8 at turn18.\n\n          Then we need to be at 9 at turn18, so we must have done 7 ups in the first 7 actions, but we only did 6 ups from turn11 to turn17.\n\n          So we need to do an additional up somewhere, but that would require an action at turn18, and then we are at 9 at turn19.\n\n          Given the above, it seems impossible to be at 9 at turn18.\n\n          What if we\nWe are allowed to move down and then up later. \n\n          For example, at turn14: we are at 4, and we move down to 3 at turn15, then up at turn15 to 4, but that doesn't help.\n\n          or at turn14: we move down to 3 at turn15, then at turn15: move up to 4 at turn16, then we are behind.\n\n          So the only safe way is to wait at the beginning and then move up, and then we are at 9 at turn19.\n\n          Then the condition for the problem: \n             We have to be at 9 at turn19.\n             We did 8 actions: turns11 to 18.\n             Then turn t1+H-1 = 11+8-1 = 18: but we are not at 9 at turn18.\n\n          So the only way is to have H=9, and then we are at turn19 at the beginning at 9.\n\n          How? \n             We do 8 actions to get to 8 at turn19, and then we do a stay or something at turn19? but then we are at 8 at turn19 and then we would need to do U at turn19 to get to 9 at turn20, but then we are at 9 at turn20.\n\n          then for H=9: we require at turn11+9-1=19 to be at 9.\n          So we must be at 9 at the beginning of turn19.\n\n          To be at 9 at turn19, we must have done a net of 7 ups in the first 8 actions.\n\n          for example: \n             turn11: S (y12=2)\n             turn12: U (y13=3)\n             turn13: U (y14=4)\n             turn14: U (y15=5)\n             turn15: U (y16=6)\n             turn16: U (y17=7)\n             turn17: U (y18=8)\n             turn18: U (y19=9) \n             then at the beginning of turn19: y=9.\n\n          Then the action at turn18 is the last action? \n\n          But we have 8 actions: turn11 to turn18.\n\n          then H=8, not 9.\n\n          because we've done 8 actions.\n\n          then turn19: we are at 9, and we are at turn19, which is after the last action.\n\n          the condition is that at turn18 (t1+8-1=18) we are at 9? -> no, we are at 8 at turn18 (beginning) and then we do U to get to 9 at turn19.\n\n          So to be at 9 at turn18, we would have to have been at 8 at turn17 and then done U at turn17 to get to 9 at turn18.\n\n          then the actions would be:\n             turn11: S (y12=2)\n             turn12: U (y13=3)\n             turn13: U (y14=4)\n             turn14: U (y15=5)\n             turn15: U (y16=6)\n             turn16: U (y17=7)\n             turn17: U (y18=9) -> wait, from 7 to 9? not possible.\n\n          So we must have been at 8 at turn17.\n\n          then the net after 7 actions ( turn11 to turn17) must be 6 Ups? because from 2 to 8: requires 6 net ups.\n\n          then: \n             turn11: must be S or D to avoid being at 3 at turn12.\n             turn12: then we are at 2 or 1.\n             then we need to net 6 ups in 6 actions ( turn12 to turn17) -> \n                 if we are at 2: then 2+6=8.\n                 if we are at 1: then 1+6=7.\n\n          not enough.\n\n          if we are at 2 at turn12, and we do 7 ups in the next 6 actions? not possible.\n\n          Therefore, the only safe way to 9 is to arrive at turn19, and we need to output a sequence for H=8 that gets us to 9 at turn19.\n\n          But the problem requires that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9.\n\n          So we must output H=8 and the sequence as above, and then at turn18 we are at 8, not 9.\n\n          This is a ( very) \nWe must output a sequence for which at turn18 we are at 9.\n\n after more thought, we can try to use the safe freeways 1 and 2 at the beginning and then later when freeways 3-8 are safe (after turn12) we can move up quickly.\n\n but to net 7 ups in 7 actions, we need to do a up on every action from turn11 to turn17, which is not possible because of turn12.\n\n So we must have H>7.\n\n for H=8, we need the net over the first 7 actions to be 7 ups, which is impossible because of the turn12 constraint.\n\n Therefore, the minimal H is 8, and we are at 9 at turn19, and we must output the sequence for 8 actions, and the condition is that at turn19 ( which is after the last action) we are at 9, but the problem requires at turn18 ( which is before the last action) we are at 9.\n\n This indicates a misunderstanding.\n\n Let me read the problem again: \" a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) \"\n\n and \" avoid collisions with cars on freeways\"\n\n and \" determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\n and \" such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\n So to satisfy: we must have a sequence of H actions ( applied at turns t1 to t1+H-1) and then at turn t1+H-1, the player is at y=9.\n\n In our safe sequence, we have:\n\n   actions: \n      a11, a12, a13, a14, a15, a16, a17, a18   (H=8)\n   then the state at turn18 ( which is t1+7) is given by the action at turn17: \n        y18 = y17 + a17.\n   but we want y18=9.\n\n   in our sequence: \n        a11 = S -> y12 =2\n        a12 = U -> y13=3\n        a13 = U -> y14=4\n        a14 = U -> y15=5\n        a15 = U -> y16=6\n        a16 = U -> y17=7\n        a17 = U -> y18=8\n        a18 = ? -> but we are at y18=8 at the beginning of turn18, then we do a18 to get y19.\n\n   so we are not at 9 at turn18.\n\n   to be at 9 at turn18, we would need y18=9, which means after the action at turn17 we have y18=9.\n\n   then we would have done 7 actions: from turn11 to turn17, and then at turn18 we are at 9, and we would not need the action at turn18.\n\n   so the sequence would be for H=7: but we know we cannot in 7 actions because of the collision.\n\n   for H=8, we must include the action at turn18, and then we are at y19, not y18.\n\n   unless the last action is at turn17, and then we have done 7 actions, and then at turn18 we are at 9.\n\n   then H=7.\n\n Given the above, I think the only way is to output the sequence for H=8 and state that we are at 9 at turn19, and if the problem absolutely requires at turn18, then we must find a way.\n\n or to output a sequence for H=9.\n\n for H=9, we require at turn19 (t1+9-1=19) to be at 9.\n\n then we can do the safe sequence of 8 actions to get to 9 at turn19, and then we do an extra action ( say S) at turn19.\n\n but then at turn19: we are at 9, safe, and then we do S -> then at turn20: we are still at 9, but we don't care.\n\n and the state at turn19 is 9, so it satisfies.\n\n then the sequence for 9 actions:\n\n   turn11: S\n   turn12: U\n   turn13: U\n   turn14: U\n   turn15: U\n   turn16: U\n   turn17: U\n   turn18: U   # at turn19: y=9\n   turn19: S   # any action, say S\n\n then at the beginning of turn19: y=9, so condition for turn19 ( which is t1+9-1=19) is met.\n\n and we avoid collisions.\n\n so H=9.\n\n is there a sequence with H=8 that has y18=9? \n\n   to have y18=9, we must have in the first 7 actions net 7 ups.\n\n   and avoid collision at turn12.\n\n   the only way to avoid collision at turn12 is to be at safe freeway (1 or 2) at turn12.\n\n   then from there, we need to net 7 - (0 or -1) = 7 or 8 ups in 6 actions ( from turn12 to turn17) -> impossible.\n\n Therefore, the minimal H is 9.\n\n But is there a faster way? \n\n   for example, on turn16, freeway6 is safe, and we can do a double up? not possible.\n\n   or on turn11: we do U ( which is unsafe) -> not allowed.\n\n   or we\nWe might use the safe haven of freeway1 for more than one turn.\n\n   turn11: D ( to 1 at turn12) -> safe.\n   turn12: D ( to 0 at turn13) -> safe (freeway0 has no cars? The freeways with cars are 1-8, so freeway0 is safe)\n   turn13: we can then do U to 1 at turn14.\n   turn14: U to 2 at turn15.\n   turn15: U to 3 at turn16: freeway3 at turn16: safe.\n   turn16: U to 4 at turn17: safe.\n   turn17: U to 5 at turn18: safe.\n   turn18: U to 6 at turn19: \n   then we are at 6 at turn19, and we need to do more.\n\n not efficient.\n\n Given the above, the safe sequence with waiting at the beginning and then moving up (8 ups in 8 actions) gets us to 9 at turn19, and then we can do one extra action (H=9) to satisfy being at 9 at turn19.\n\n so the sequence is:\n\n   turn11: S\n   turn12: U\n   turn13: U\n   turn14: U\n   turn15: U\n   turn16: U\n   turn17: U\n   turn18: U\n   turn19: S   # any action, for example.\n\n and we are at 9 at the beginning of turn19.\n\n so the answer is H=9 and the sequence as above.\n\n but the problem asks for the minimal H.\n\n is there a sequence with H=8 that gets us to 9 at turn18? \n\n   we would need to be at 9 at turn18.\n\n   to be at 9 at turn18, we must have done 7 net ups in the first 7 actions.\n\n   then the only issue is turn12.\n\n   on turn12, we must be at a safe freeway (1 or 2).\n\n   then at turn12, we are at y= either 1 or 2.\n\n   then from there, we need to net 7 or 6 ups in the next 6 actions ( to get to 8 or 9) at turn18.\n\n   to net 6 ups in 6 actions: then at turn18: if we start at 2, then 2+6=8.\n                          if we start at 1, then 1+6=7.\n\n   not 9.\n\n   to net 7 ups in 6 actions: impossible.\n\n therefore, H=9 is the minimal.\n\n So the sequence is for actions at turn11 to turn19 (9 actions).\n\n But note: the sequence should be only from turn11 to turn11+9-1 = turn19, so 9 actions.\n\n in the answer format:\n\n   \\boxed{\n   Turn 11: S\n   Turn 12: U\n   Turn 13: U\n   Turn 14: U\n   Turn 15: U\n   Turn 16: U\n   Turn 17: U\n   Turn 18: U\n   Turn 19: S\n   }\n\n But note, at turn19: we are already at 9, and we do S, which is safe.\n\n and we avoid collisions at every turn:\n\n   turn11: freeway2 -> safe.\n   turn12: freeway2 -> safe.\n   turn13: freeway3 -> safe ( because turn13 is not 11,12,17,18) -> safe.\n   turn14: freeway4 -> safe ( turn14 not in {11,12,17,18})\n   turn15: freeway5 -> safe ( only dangerous at 11,12)\n   turn16: freeway6 -> safe.\n   turn17: freeway7 -> safe.\n   turn18: freeway8 -> safe.\n   turn19: freeway9 -> safe.\n\n and at turn19, after the action, we are still at 9.\n\n So this works.\n\n Is there a sequence with H=8? \n\n   we would need to be at 9 at turn18 ( for H=8, then turn18 = 11+8-1=18) \n\n   and we have 8 actions: turn11 to turn18.\n\n   then the state at turn18 is after the action at turn18: but the state at the beginning of turn18 is before the action.\n\n   to have the state at the beginning of turn18 as 9, we must have had the action at turn17 set it to 9.\n\n   then we only use 7 actions: from turn11 to turn17.\n\n   and then at turn18: we are at 9, and then we do the last action (at turn18) -> then the state at turn19 will be 9 or 10, but we don't care.\n\n   so the first 7 actions must net 7 ups and avoid collisions.\n\n   we cannot.\n\n therefore, minimal H is 9.\n\n So the answer is the sequence above.\n\n But note: at turn19, we could do U or D as well, but we are at 9, so we cannot do U ( because then we would go to 10, which is invalid) or D to 8, but then we are not at 9.\n\n so we must do S at turn19.\n\n Therefore, the sequence is:\n\n   Turn11: S\n   Turn12: U\n   Turn13: U\n   Turn14: U\n   Turn15: U\n   Turn16: U\n   Turn17: U\n   Turn18: U\n   Turn19: S\n\n This achieves the goal at turn19.\n\n So we output this.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 11\\) is 9. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) by waiting at \\(y = 2\\) during turn 11 to avoid the dangerous freeways at turn 12, then moving up one freeway per turn. The dangerous turns for each freeway are:\n- Freeways 3 and 4: dangerous at turns 11, 12, 17, 18\n- Freeways 5, 6, 7, 8: dangerous at turns 11, 12\n- Freeways 1 and 2: safe at all turns\n\nThe sequence ensures the player is on safe freeways at each turn:\n- Turn 11: Stay at \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2, safe)\n- Turn 12: Move up to \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3 at turn 13, safe since turn 13 is not dangerous)\n- Turn 13: Move up to \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4 at turn 14, safe)\n- Turn 14: Move up to \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5 at turn 15, safe)\n- Turn 15: Move up to \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6 at turn 16, safe)\n- Turn 16: Move up to \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7 at turn 17, safe)\n- Turn 17: Move up to \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8 at turn 18, safe)\n- Turn 18: Move up to \\(y = 9\\) (freeway 9 at turn 19, safe as no cars on freeway 9)\n- Turn 19: Stay at \\(y = 9\\) (goal reached and maintained)\n\nAt turn 19 (which is \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 11 + 9 - 1 = 19\\)), the player is at \\((0, 9)\\).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 11: S \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: U \\\\\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U \\\\\nTurn 19: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 13, and the player is at (0,3). We need to get to (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nImportant note: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y_T (which is between 1 and 8) and at that turn T, the car on that freeway has its span including 0 (the x-coordinate where the player is). Also note that when moving, at turn T we are on y_T and then we move to y_{T+1} at the next turn. So at turn T, we are on y_T and we check the car on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nThe car update:\n- Left-moving: span at T = [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]   (note: head and tail are given at t1, and we subtract s*(T-t1) because moving left decreases the x-coordinate)\n- Right-moving: span at T = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] (because the head is the larger x? Actually, the table says for right: Span(t1)=[τ, h] -> at T: [τ+s*(T-t1), h+s*(T-t1)]. So for right-moving, the head is the larger x, and tail is the smaller.\n\nBut note: the description for right-moving says: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" meaning that at time t1, the car goes from τ to h (with τ < h, because it's [τ, h] and moving right). Then at time T, it becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: Span(t1)=[h, τ] -> meaning h is the head (larger x) and τ is the tail (smaller x)? But note: the update says [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. So if the car is moving left, the entire car shifts left. Therefore, at time t1, the car occupies [h, τ] (but note: if h > τ, then it's from τ to h? Actually, the notation [h, τ] might be confusing. Let me reinterpret:\n\nThe problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]. If the car is moving left, then the head (front) is at a larger x at t1, and as time goes by, both head and tail decrease. But the notation [h, τ] might imply that h is the leftmost? Actually, no: because if the car is moving left, then at t1, the head is at h (which is the rightmost point) and the tail at τ (leftmost). Then the span is from τ to h? But they write [h, τ] which is backwards? Or is it [min, max]?\n\nLooking at the example for right: they write [τ, h] meaning [left_end, right_end]. So for left, they write [h, τ] meaning [right_end, left_end]? That would be inconsistent. Alternatively, they might be writing the head and tail without specifying order? But the update rule clarifies.\n\nActually, the update rule for left: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]: this interval will be from (h - s*(T-t1)) to (τ - s*(T-t1)). Since the car is moving left, we expect the entire interval to shift left. But if h and τ are such that h > τ, then the interval [h, τ] doesn't make sense? So I think the notation [h, τ] for left-moving is actually [head, tail] with head being the front (which for left-moving is the rightmost point) and tail the leftmost. So the span is from tail to head? But the interval is written as [head, tail] which would be [right, left] and that is decreasing? So the interval is from min to max? Or is it just the two endpoints?\n\nThe collision condition: at turn T, we are at (0, y_T) and we require that 0 is in the span of the car on freeway y_T. The span is a contiguous interval. So for a left-moving car at time T, the span is [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)] and we assume that h and τ are such that h > τ? Because the car moves left and the head is the right end? Similarly, for right-moving: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] and we assume τ < h.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\nFor freeway 1: (12, 47, left, 36) -> but 12 and 47: if it's [h, τ] then h=12, τ=47? But that would imply the head is 12 and tail is 47? That doesn't make sense because 12<47. So I think the notation in the table is (head, tail, direction, speed). For left-moving, the head should be the right end, so if the car is moving left, the head should be greater than the tail. But here head=12, tail=47? 12<47, so that would be backwards.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3: (12,1,right,6): for right-moving, head should be the front (the larger x) and tail the smaller? But here head=12, tail=1 -> that makes sense: so the car at t1 on freeway 3 is from 1 to 12? But wait: the span for right-moving at t1 is [τ, h] = [1, 12]? So that's consistent.\n\nBut for freeway 1: left-moving: (12,47,left,36): if head=12 and tail=47, then since it's left-moving, the head (front) should be the right end? But 12 < 47, so that would mean the head is at 12 and the tail at 47? But then the car would be from 12 to 47? Then moving left: the head moves left and the tail moves left. So at time t1, the car occupies [12,47] (from 12 to 47). Then at time T, the car occupies [12 - 36*(T-13), 47 - 36*(T-13)].\n\nBut wait: the problem says for left: \"Span(t1)=[h, τ]\" and then at T: [h-s*(T-t1), τ-s*(T-t1)]. If h=12 and τ=47, then at T: [12-36*(T-13), 47-36*(T-13)]. Since 12-36*(T-13) < 47-36*(T-13) for any T? Actually, no: because 12<47, and subtracting the same amount, the lower bound is 12-... and the upper bound is 47-... so the interval is [12-36d, 47-36d] where d=T-13.\n\nSimilarly, for right: (head, tail) = (12,1) for right: then at t1, the span is [1,12] (because [τ, h] = [1,12]). Then at T: [1+6*(T-13), 12+6*(T-13)].\n\nBut in the table, freeway 1: (12,47,left,36) -> so the car is long: 35 units? (from 12 to 47 is 35 units). And freeway 3 has three cars: (12,1,right,6), (-24,-35,right,6), (54,43,right,6). Note: the second car: (-24,-35) -> tail=-35, head=-24? Then at t1, the span is [tail, head] = [-35, -24]. Then at T: [-35+6d, -24+6d]. Similarly, the third car: (54,43,right,6) -> tail=43, head=54? Then [43,54] at t1? But wait: the table says (54,43) -> so head=54, tail=43? Then the span at t1 is [43,54]. Then at T: [43+6d, 54+6d].\n\nNow, the player is at (0,3) at turn 13. We need to go to y=9. The player moves in the y-direction only: U (up: y+1), D (down: y-1), S (stay: y same). And we must avoid y=0? Actually, y in [0,9] and we start at y=3 and goal is y=9. So we must go up.\n\nBut note: we cannot go above 9, so we have to stop at 9.\n\nThe challenge: avoid the cars on freeways 1 to 8 when we are on that freeway at a particular turn.\n\nImportant: when we are at turn T, we are on freeway y_T. We check the car(s) on freeway y_T at turn T. If at turn T, we are on a freeway k (where k from 1 to 8) and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at that turn, then collision.\n\nNote: if we are at y=0 or y=9, there are no cars (since cars are on freeways 1-8). So we are safe at y=0 and y=9.\n\nOur goal is to be at (0,9). So at the turn when we first reach y=9, we are done. And we are not on any freeway that has cars when we are at y=9.\n\nPlan: we need to move from y=3 to y=9. The minimal steps in terms of moves is 6 steps (each U) if there were no cars. But we have to avoid the cars on the freeways we step on.\n\nWe are at turn 13 at y=3. We can choose actions: U, D, S.\n\nWe need to simulate the future turns and check for collisions.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t0 = 13.\n\nWe are going to simulate for turns T = 13, 14, 15, ... until we reach y=9.\n\nAt each turn T, we are at y_T. We need to check if y_T is between 1 and 8, then we must check the cars on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nNote: the state of the cars at turn T (relative to t0=13) is determined by d = T - 13.\n\nWe are going to try to find the minimal H such that we can go from y=3 to y=9 in H-1 moves? Actually, H is the number of turns we take actions. We start at turn t1=13 and we take actions until we reach y=9 at turn t1+H-1. Actually, the sequence is from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1, so the turns are t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. And at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). So we take H actions: at turn t1 (the first action) to turn t1+H-1 (the last action).\n\nWe start at y_13 = 3. After H turns, we are at y_{13+H} = 9. So we need to have y_{13+H} = 9.\n\nThe path: we start at 3, and then after each action we update y.\n\nWe need to avoid, for each turn T in [13, 13+H-1], if y_T is between 1 and 8, then we must check that 0 is not in the span of any car on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nNote: at the turn T when we are at y_T, we are on that freeway at that exact turn. When we move from y_T to y_{T+1}, at turn T we are still on y_T. Then at turn T+1, we are on y_{T+1}.\n\nSo the plan is to simulate the movement and check the freeways we step on.\n\nWe are going to try to go as fast as possible: 6 steps upward. But we must avoid the freeways at the times we are on them.\n\nLet me compute the car positions at future turns.\n\nDefine d = T - 13.\n\nFor each freeway, the cars:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: left-moving, head=12, tail=47, speed=36. \n  At T: [12 - 36d, 47 - 36d]\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: [12-36d, 47-36d]\n\nFreeway 3: three cars:\n  Car1: right-moving, head=12, tail=1, speed=6 -> [1+6d, 12+6d]\n  Car2: right-moving, head=-24, tail=-35, speed=6 -> [-35+6d, -24+6d]\n  Car3: right-moving, head=54, tail=43, speed=6 -> [43+6d, 54+6d]\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3: same three cars.\n\nFreeway 5: one car: right-moving, head=12, tail=1 -> [1+6d, 12+6d]\n\nFreeway 6: same as 5: [1+6d, 12+6d]\n\nFreeway 7: same as 5: [1+6d, 12+6d]\n\nFreeway 8: same as 5: [1+6d, 12+6d]\n\nNow, we are at turn 13 (d=0) at y=3. We don't need to check y=3 at turn 13? Actually, we do: because we are on freeway 3 at turn 13? But the problem says: collision occurs at turn T only if we are on a freeway (1-8) and 0 is in the span. So at turn 13, we are at freeway 3. We must check freeway 3 at d=0.\n\nFor freeway 3 at d=0:\n  Car1: [1,12] -> 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe for this car.\n  Car2: [-35,-24] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n  Car3: [43,54] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nSo we are safe at turn 13.\n\nNow, we can take an action at turn 13: U, D, or S.\n\nWe want to go up, so ideally U. But we have to check the next freeway we step on.\n\nIf we go up at turn 13: then at turn 14, we are at y=4. Then we are on freeway 4 at turn 14 (d=1).\n\nCheck freeway 4 at d=1:\n  Car1: [1+6*1, 12+6*1] = [7,18] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n  Car2: [-35+6, -24+6] = [-29,-18] -> safe.\n  Car3: [43+6,54+6] = [49,60] -> safe.\n\nThen we can go up again: at turn 14: U -> at turn 15: y=5 (freeway 5) at d=2.\n\nFreeway 5 at d=2: only one car: [1+6*2, 12+12] = [13,24] -> safe (0 not in).\n\nThen turn 15: U -> turn 16: y=6 (freeway6) at d=3: [1+18,12+18]=[19,30] -> safe.\n\nThen turn 16: U -> turn 17: y=7 (freeway7) at d=4: [1+24,12+24]=[25,36] -> safe.\n\nThen turn 17: U -> turn 18: y=8 (freeway8) at d=5: [1+30,12+30]=[31,42] -> safe.\n\nThen turn 18: U -> turn 19: y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo in 6 moves (from turn13 to turn18, 6 actions) we are at y=9 at turn19.\n\nBut wait: we started at turn13 at y=3. Then:\n\nTurn13: action U -> turn14: y=4\nTurn14: U -> turn15: y=5\nTurn15: U -> turn16: y=6\nTurn16: U -> turn17: y=7\nTurn17: U -> turn18: y=8\nTurn18: U -> turn19: y=9.\n\nSo we need 6 actions: at turns13,14,15,16,17,18.\n\nBut we must check every step:\n\nAt turn13: we are at y=3 (freeway3) at d=0 -> safe (as above).\n\nAt turn14: at y=4 (freeway4) at d=1: safe (as above).\n\nAt turn15: at y=5 (freeway5) at d=2: [1+12, 12+12]? Wait, d=2: [1+6*2, 12+6*2] = [13,24] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nAt turn16: at y=6 (freeway6) at d=3: [1+18,12+18]=[19,30] -> safe.\n\nAt turn17: at y=7 (freeway7) at d=4: [25,36] -> safe.\n\nAt turn18: at y=8 (freeway8) at d=5: [31,42] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn19: we are at y=9 -> goal, and no car check.\n\nSo this path seems safe. And it takes 6 moves.\n\nBut is there any freeway that we step on that might be dangerous? We didn't check freeways 1 and 2 because we are going from 3 to 4 to ... to 8 to 9.\n\nBut what about freeway 1 and 2? They are below us. We never step on them again? We started at 3 and only went up.\n\nSo minimal H is 6? Then the sequence is 6 U's.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 1 and 2 at the turns we are on the freeways above 2: we never go to freeway 1 or 2 after turn13? At turn13 we are at 3, then we go to 4,5,...,9. So we avoid freeways 1 and 2.\n\nBut what about the cars on freeway 1 and 2? They are moving and might be at 0 at some turn? But we are not on freeway 1 or 2 at any turn after 13, so no collision.\n\nHowever, note that at turn13 we were at freeway3, but we didn't go to freeway1 or 2 again.\n\nSo the plan: 6 consecutive U moves.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y = 1, ..., 8\". And we are only on freeways 3,4,5,6,7,8 at turns 13,14,15,16,17,18 respectively. And we checked all: they are safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 6.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=6? Actually, the sequence is from t=0 to H-1 relative to t1, so H is the number of actions. And we have 6 actions.\n\nBut let me check the goal: after 6 actions, we are at turn 13+6 = 19, and y_19 = 3 + 6 = 9. So correct.\n\nBut is there a possibility that we can do it in fewer? From 3 to 9: we need to go up 6 steps. So minimal is 6.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\nTurn t_1: U\nTurn t_1 + 1: U\nTurn t_1 + 2: U\nTurn t_1 + 3: U\nTurn t_1 + 4: U\nTurn t_1 + 5: U\n\nBut the answer format: the turns are labeled as \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". So for t=0 to H-1: that is t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nSo we have 6 actions: from t1 to t1+5.\n\nBut in the boxed answer, we write:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: U\nTurn t_1 + 1: U\nTurn t_1 + 2: U\nTurn t_1 + 3: U\nTurn t_1 + 4: U\nTurn t_1 + 5: U\n}\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 3 at d=0: we are at turn13, freeway3: we checked: safe.\n\nBut wait: at turn13, we are at freeway3. The cars on freeway3: three cars. We checked: [1,12], [-35,-24], [43,54] -> none contains 0.\n\nBut what about the car on freeway1? We are not on freeway1 at turn13, so we don't care.\n\nBut is there any chance that at a later turn we are forced to go down? Why? We can go straight up.\n\nBut wait: the problem says that we must avoid collisions. And we did.\n\nBut let me check freeway 8 at d=5: [1+6*5, 12+6*5] = [1+30,12+30]=[31,42] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nBut what if we try to go faster? We cannot: we need 6 moves.\n\nAlternatively, we could wait (S) at some turn to avoid a collision? But in this case, we don't need to.\n\nBut wait: what about freeway 1? The car on freeway1: at d=0: [12,47] -> but we are not on freeway1 at any turn? We are at y=3 at turn13, then y=4 at turn14, etc.\n\nBut what if the car on freeway1 at some turn has 0 in its span? But we are not on freeway1 at that turn, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, freeway2: same.\n\nSo the direct path is safe.\n\nBut wait: I just noticed that the car on freeway1 and freeway2 are the same: [12-36d, 47-36d]. When will this car cover 0?\n\nWe require: 12-36d <= 0 <= 47-36d.\n\nSolve: \n12-36d <= 0 -> 12 <= 36d -> d>= 12/36 = 1/3 -> so d>=1 (since d integer) then 12-36d <= 0 is true for d>=1.\n\nAnd 0<=47-36d -> 36d<=47 -> d<=47/36≈1.305 -> so d=1.\n\nAt d=1: [12-36, 47-36] = [-24,11] -> 0 is in [-24,11]? Yes, 0 is between -24 and 11.\n\nSo at d=1 (turn14), the car on freeway1 and freeway2 (both) has 0 in its span.\n\nBut at turn14, we are at y=4 (if we took U at turn13). We are not on freeway1 or 2. We are on freeway4. And freeway4 at d=1: we checked: safe. So we are safe.\n\nBut if we had been on freeway1 or 2 at turn14, we would have collided. But we are not.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway2: same as freeway1.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nBut what if we had to go through freeway1? We don't.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nBut wait: what if we start at turn13 at y=3, and we go down? That would be bad because we are moving away from 9. So we don't.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 6.\n\nBut let me check if there is a path with H<6? Impossible: we need 6 moves upward.\n\nSo the answer is 6 consecutive U's.\n\nBut the problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\". We have H=6.\n\nBut the answer format only asks for the sequence of actions.\n\nSo we write:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: U\nTurn t_1 + 1: U\nTurn t_1 + 2: U\nTurn t_1 + 3: U\nTurn t_1 + 4: U\nTurn t_1 + 5: U\n}\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\". So t=0 to 5: that's 6 actions.\n\nBut let me confirm the indices:\n\nAt t_1 (turn13): we take U -> then at turn14 we are at y=4.\n...\nAt t_1+5 (turn18): we take U -> then at turn19 we are at y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut note: at turn19, we are at y=9, and we don't take an action after that? The sequence is for t=0 to H-1, which are the actions taken at turns t_1 to t_1+H-1. Then at turn t_1+H, we are at the next state. But we require that at turn t_1+H-1 we are at (0,9). Actually, the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t_1+H-1? Let me read:\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1\"\n\nThe problem says: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence ... to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd: \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nSo after H actions (from t_1 to t_1+H-1), at the next state (which is turn t_1+H) we are at y_{t_1+H}? But note:\n\nThe action a_t is taken at turn t, and then the next state is at turn t+1.\n\nSo:\n\nAt turn t_1: we are at y_{t_1} = 3.\nAfter action a_{t_1}, at turn t_1+1: y_{t_1+1} = y_{t_1} + Delta.\n\nSo the position after the action is at the next turn.\n\nWe require that at turn t_1+H-1, we have y_{t_1+H-1}=9? But that would be after H-1 actions? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"y_{t_1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nBut:\n\n- At turn t_1 (after 0 actions) we are at y_{t_1}=3.\n- After 1 action (at turn t_1): we are at turn t_1+1: y_{t_1+1}=3+1=4 (if U).\n- After 2 actions: at turn t_1+2: y=5.\n- ...\n- After k actions: at turn t_1+k: y=3+k.\n\nWe require: y_{t_1+H-1}=9.\n\nSo 3 + (H-1) = 9 -> H-1=6 -> H=7.\n\nThis is a critical point.\n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning actions at turns: t_1+0, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1.\n\nAnd then \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1\".\n\nBut after the last action (at turn t_1+H-1), the next state is at turn t_1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t_1+H-1} = 9\". That means that at the turn when we take the last action, we are already at 9? \n\nLet me re-read the problem:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd then: \"y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nSo at turn t_1+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nBut note: at turn t_1, we start at y=3. Then:\n\n- At turn t_1: we are at y=3.\n- We take action a_{t_1} at turn t_1, which moves us to y_{t_1+1} at turn t_1+1.\n\nSo the state y_t is at the beginning of turn t? Or after the action?\n\nThe problem says: \"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\"\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t, we take action a_t, then we move to y_{t+1}.\n\nSo the position at turn t is y_t.\n\nWe require that at turn t_1+H-1, we are at y_{t_1+H-1}=9.\n\nHow many actions have been taken by then?\n\nFrom turn t_1 to turn t_1+H-1: we take actions at turns t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-2? \n\nBecause the last action we take at turn t_1+H-2 leads to y_{t_1+H-1}.\n\nBut the problem says we take actions at turns t_1 to t_1+H-1: that's H actions.\n\nBut then the state after the last action (at turn t_1+H-1) is y_{t_1+H}.\n\nBut we require y_{t_1+H-1}=9.\n\nSo there is a mismatch.\n\nLet me see the problem again:\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" -> this means we take actions at turns: t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1+H-1.\n\nThen the state after these actions: after the action at turn t_1+H-1, we get y_{t_1+H}.\n\nBut the requirement is: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1\".\n\nThat means we must have y_{t_1+H-1}=9.\n\nBut at turn t_1+H-1, we are about to take an action? And we take an action at that turn? Then that action would change y.\n\nSo if we are at y_{t_1+H-1}=9, and we take an action at that turn, then we move to y_{t_1+H} which might be 10 (if we go U) or 8 (if D) or 9 (if S). But we want to be at 9 at that turn? And then we take an action? But the requirement is to be at (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1.\n\nSo we must be at 9 at the beginning of turn t_1+H-1.\n\nBut the actions we take at turns t_1 to t_1+H-1: that includes an action at turn t_1+H-1.\n\nSo if we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t_1+H-1, and we take an action, then we leave 9? But we want to be at 9 at that turn? Actually, we are at 9 at the start of the turn, and then we take an action. The problem doesn't say we have to stay at 9, but we are required to be at (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1. So we are at 9 at the start of the turn. Then we take an action? But if we take an action at that turn, we move away? But the requirement is only to be at 9 at that turn. Then we can take any action? But then we are not at 9 anymore? But the goal is to reach (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1, and then we are done? \n\nThe problem says: \"to reach (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1\". So we must be at (0,9) at that turn. And then we stop? But the sequence of actions includes an action at that turn. So we must take an action that leaves us at 9? Only S would work.\n\nTherefore, if we are at 9 at the start of turn t_1+H-1, we must take S to stay at 9.\n\nBut in our plan, we are at y=9 at turn t_1+6? Let's see:\n\nWe start at turn13: y13=3.\n\nAfter action at turn13: y14 = 4.\n...\nAfter action at turn18: y19=9.\n\nSo at turn19, we are at y=9. But we require to be at y=9 at turn t_1+H-1.\n\nSo we want y_{t_1+H-1}=9.\n\nIn our case, we are at y=9 at turn19. So t_1+H-1=19 -> 13+H-1=19 -> H=7.\n\nBut we took 6 actions: from turn13 to turn18. Then at turn19 we are at 9. But the requirement is that at turn t_1+H-1 we are at 9, and we take H actions? \n\nThe sequence of actions is for t=0 to H-1: so turns t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nWe have:\n\nAction at turn13: a13\nAction at turn14: a14\n...\nAction at turn13+H-1: a_{13+H-1}\n\nAnd after the last action, we are at y_{13+H}.\n\nBut we require y_{13+H-1}=9.\n\nSo we are at 9 at the beginning of turn 13+H-1.\n\nThen we take an action at turn 13+H-1. That action must not move us away? But we can take S. Then we stay at 9, so at the next state y_{13+H} is still 9, but we don't care about that state? We only care that at turn 13+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nBut note: we are at 9 at the start of turn 13+H-1, so we are at 9 at that turn. Then we take an action at that turn? But the problem doesn't say we have to stop; it just says we must be at 9 at that turn. And we can take any action? But if we take U or D, we move away. But the requirement is only to be at 9 at turn 13+H-1. So we can take any action? However, if we move away, then we are not at 9 at the next turn, but that's after.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1+H-1\". So we must be at 9 at turn t_1+H-1. What we do after that action is not specified.\n\nBut in our case, we can be at 9 at turn t_1+H-1 by arriving at the start of that turn. How do we arrive? By an action at the previous turn.\n\nIn our original plan, we arrived at turn19 (which is y19=9) by an action at turn18. So at the start of turn19, we are at 9. So if we set t_1+H-1=19, then H-1=19-13=6, so H=7.\n\nThen the sequence of actions has 7 actions: from turn13 to turn19? But turn19 is the last action? But then we take an action at turn19? But we are already at 9 at the start of turn19, so if we take an action, we might move away.\n\nBut we can take S at turn19 to stay.\n\nSo the minimal H would be 7: we take 6 U's to get to 9 at turn19, and then at turn19 we take S to stay at 9. But wait, at turn19 we are at 9, and we take S: then we stay at 9. But the requirement is to be at 9 at turn19 (t_1+H-1=19). So we are at 9 at the start of turn19, and then we take S and we are still at 9 for the next state? But the turn19 is the turn we are required to be at 9. So we are at 9 at that turn.\n\nBut is it necessary to take an action at turn19? Yes, because the sequence includes turn19.\n\nSo with H=7:\n\nActions at turns: 13,14,15,16,17,18,19.\n\nWe want to be at y=9 at turn19 (the start of turn19).\n\nSo:\n\nAt turn13: we are at y13=3. We take U -> y14=4.\nAt turn14: U -> y15=5.\nAt turn15: U -> y16=6.\nAt turn16: U -> y17=7.\nAt turn17: U -> y18=8.\nAt turn18: U -> y19=9.\nAt turn19: we are at y19=9. Then we take S -> y20=9.\n\nBut we require y_{t_1+H-1}=y_{13+7-1}=y_{19}=9. So we are at 9 at turn19. And we take an action at turn19 (S) to stay.\n\nBut is that necessary? The requirement is to be at 9 at turn19. We are at 9 at turn19. We don't need to take an action after? But the sequence includes an action at turn19.\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\". So as long as at turn19 we are at (0,9), then we have reached. The action at turn19 doesn't change the fact that we are at (0,9) at turn19.\n\nBut the action at turn19 will move us to turn20, but that's beyond the requirement.\n\nSo we can take any action at turn19? But we are required to avoid collisions only at the turns we are on freeways 1-8. At turn19, we are at y=9, so no car to avoid. Then we can take any action? But if we take U, we go to 10, which is invalid? The player update says y in [0,9]. So if we are at 9 and take U, it should stay? Or is it clamped? The problem says: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\" and then \"y_{t+1} in [0,9]\". So it must be clamped? But it doesn't specify. Let me check:\n\n\"y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\", and then \"y_{t+1} \\in [0,9]\". So if we are at 9 and take U, we try to go to 10, but then it must be clamped to 9? Or is it not allowed? The problem doesn't specify clamping, but it says y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So probably we are not allowed to go outside. But the problem says \"where Delta y_t is defined and then y_{t+1} in [0,9]\". So if we are at 9 and take U, we remain at 9? Similarly for 0 and D.\n\nTo be safe, we can take S at turn19.\n\nBut note: we don't care about turn20. So we can take S, U, or D? But if we take U, we might go to 10 which is invalid? But the problem says y in [0,9], so it must be that we are clamped. I think we can assume that if we try to go above 9, we stay at 9. Similarly for below 0.\n\nSo at turn19, we are at 9, and if we take U, we stay at 9. Similarly, D would go to 8? But we don't want that. So we can take U or S.\n\nBut to be safe, we take S.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn13: U\nTurn14: U\nTurn15: U\nTurn16: U\nTurn17: U\nTurn18: U\nTurn19: S\n\nBut is this minimal? We have H=7.\n\nBut we could be at 9 at an earlier turn? For example, at turn18.\n\nTo be at 9 at turn18: then y18=9.\n\nWe start at y13=3. So we need to gain 6 in 5 moves: from turn13 to turn17 (actions at 13,14,15,16,17) and then at turn18 we are at 9.\n\nSo we need 6 gains in 5 moves: impossible because each U gives +1. So we cannot be at 9 at turn18.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot be at 9 earlier.\n\nSo minimal H is 7.\n\nBut in the sequence above, we are at 9 at turn19, and we take an action at turn19. But the requirement is to be at 9 at turn19. So we are there.\n\nBut do we need to take an action at turn19? The problem requires a sequence of H actions that result in being at 9 at turn t_1+H-1.\n\nWith H=7, t_1+H-1=13+7-1=19, so we are at 9 at turn19.\n\nThe actions: 6 U's and then one S at the end.\n\nBut we could also take U at turn19: then we stay at 9.\n\nBut S is also fine.\n\nNow, we must check the entire path for collisions.\n\nThe path:\n\nTurn13: y13=3 -> freeway3 at d=0: safe (as before).\n\nTurn14: y14=4 -> freeway4 at d=1: \n  Car1: [1+6*1,12+6]=[7,18] -> safe.\n  Car2: [-35+6,-24+6]=[-29,-18] -> safe.\n  Car3: [43+6,54+6]=[49,60] -> safe.\n\nTurn15: y15=5 -> freeway5 at d=2: [1+12,12+12]=[13,24] -> safe.\n\nTurn16: y16=6 -> freeway6 at d=3: [1+18,12+18]=[19,30] -> safe.\n\nTurn17: y17=7 -> freeway7 at d=4: [1+24,12+24]=[25,36] -> safe.\n\nTurn18: y18=8 -> freeway8 at d=5: [1+30,12+30]=[31,42] -> safe.\n\nTurn19: y19=9 -> no freeway, safe.\n\nAnd at turn19, we are at 9, so we don't care about the action's effect on the next state for collision (since we only care up to turn19).\n\nBut note: at turn19, we are at y=9, so no car to avoid.\n\nSo the path is safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 7, and the sequence is 6 U's and then one S at the end.\n\nBut we could also take U at turn19? Then we stay at 9. So that's also safe.\n\nBut to be explicit, we can write:\n\nTurn13: U\nTurn14: U\nTurn15: U\nTurn16: U\nTurn17: U\nTurn18: U\nTurn19: S\n\nBut we could do:\n\nTurn19: U -> also stays at 9.\n\nBut S is more natural.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". We have H=7.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in H=6? That would require being at 9 at turn t_1+6-1 = 13+5=18.\n\nSo y18=9.\n\nBut we start at y13=3. We need to go from 3 to 9 in 5 moves (actions at turns13 to17). Each move U gives +1, so 5 moves: 3+5=8. So we can be at 8 at turn18, but not 9.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 7.\n\nBut what if we move faster? We cannot: only +1 per U.\n\nUnless we can move more than one step? But no, only one step per action.\n\nSo we must have at least 6 U's to gain 6. And then we must have an extra action to be at 9 at the last turn? Actually, with 6 U's, we are at 9 at turn19. So to be at 9 at turn19, we need to have an action at turn19? But the sequence for H=6 would be actions from turn13 to turn18, and then at turn19 we are at 9. But the requirement is to be at 9 at turn t_1+H-1=13+6-1=18. But at turn18, we are at y18=8 (if we took 5 U's) or if we took 6 U's we would be at 9 at turn19, not turn18.\n\nSo we must have H=7.\n\nSo the sequence is 6 U's and one S at the end.\n\nBut we can put the S in the middle? No, because we need to move up.\n\nAlternatively, we could wait at some freeway? But that would take more turns. We want minimal H.\n\nSo the fastest is to go straight up and then S at the last turn.\n\nBut we must check if there is any collision if we go straight up. We already did: safe.\n\nSo the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: U\nTurn t_1 + 1: U\nTurn t_1 + 2: U\nTurn t_1 + 3: U\nTurn t_1 + 4: U\nTurn t_1 + 5: U\nTurn t_1 + 6: S\n}\n\nBut the last turn is t_1+6, which is turn19, and we take S.\n\nBut we could also take U at the last step? Since it would stay at 9. But S is explicit.\n\nBut the problem allows U, D, S. And at y=9, U is allowed and would keep us at 9 (assuming clamping).\n\nSo we can do:\n\nTurn t_1+6: U\n\nBut to be safe, I'll do S.\n\nBut let me check the problem: it doesn't specify clamping, but it says y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if we are at 9 and take U, we must set y_{t+1}=9. So it's allowed.\n\nBut both are acceptable.\n\nHowever, the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=7 regardless.\n\nSo I'll write with S.\n\nBut note: we don't have to wait until the last turn to take S. We could take S earlier? But that would increase H. We want minimal H.\n\nSo the sequence above is minimal.\n\nBut is there a path that gets us to 9 at an earlier turn? We saw that we cannot be at 9 before turn19.\n\nTurn19 is the earliest we can be at 9: 13 (start) -> 14:4, 15:5, 16:6, 17:7, 18:8, 19:9.\n\nSo we need to be at turn19.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 7.\n\nSo the answer is as above.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 3) at turn \\(t_1 = 13\\) and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nThe minimal path requires moving upward 6 times to increase the y-coordinate from 3 to 9. However, after 6 upward moves, the player reaches y = 9 at turn 19 (since each move advances the turn by 1). The requirement is to be at (0, 9) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 19\\), which implies \\(H = 7\\) (as \\(13 + H - 1 = 19\\)).\n\n- Actions at turns 13 to 18: Move upward (U) to increase y from 3 to 9 by turn 19.\n- Action at turn 19: Stay (S) to remain at y = 9, satisfying the condition at turn 19.\n\nThe path is collision-free:\n- Turn 13 (y=3, d=0): Freeway 3 cars at [1,12], [-35,-24], [43,54] — 0 not in spans.\n- Turn 14 (y=4, d=1): Freeway 4 cars at [7,18], [-29,-18], [49,60] — 0 not in spans.\n- Turn 15 (y=5, d=2): Freeway 5 car at [13,24] — 0 not in span.\n- Turn 16 (y=6, d=3): Freeway 6 car at [19,30] — 0 not in span.\n- Turn 17 (y=7, d=4): Freeway 7 car at [25,36] — 0 not in span.\n- Turn 18 (y=8, d=5): Freeway 8 car at [31,42] — 0 not in span.\n- Turn 19 (y=9): No freeway, safe.\n\nThus, the minimal \\(H = 7\\) with the sequence:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 1: U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 2: U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 3: U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 4: U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 5: U \\\\\nTurn t_1 + 6: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,4) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t1 = 14, and I start at y=4.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movements. Cars move left or right at their speeds, and I collide only if I'm on a freeway y at turn T when 0 is in the car's span for that freeway at that turn.\n\nThe player position updates based on actions: U for up (y increases by 1), D for down (y decreases by 1), S for stay (y stays same). y is clamped between 0 and 9.\n\nThe key point is that when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1. So for collision, at turn T, I'm on y_T, so I check cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay, I'm on the same y.\n\nNow, the car spans are given at t1=14, and for future turns T, I can compute where the cars are.\n\nLet me list all the cars and their positions at t=14.\n\nFor each freeway, there are cars with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: left means moving left, so head decreases; right means moving right, head increases.\n\nIn the span, for left-moving, head is the right end, tail is left end? Let's see the update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, h and τ both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h]? It says: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nIn the table, for left-moving, it's given as (h, τ, left, s), and for right-moving, it's (h, τ, right, s), but in the update, for right-moving, it says Span(t1) = [τ, h], which might be inconsistent.\n\nLook:\n\nFor freeway 1: (-24, 11, left, 36)\n\nBut (-24, 11), if left-moving, and span is [h, τ] = [-24, 11]? But -24 to 11, that would be from left to right if x increases right, but moving left, so head should be the front when moving.\n\nI need to interpret the coordinates.\n\nAssume x=0 is the point we care about, and cars move horizontally.\n\nFor left-moving cars, direction left, so as time increases, x decreases.\n\nAt t1, span is given as (head, tail). From the update, for left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ], and it moves to [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so h and τ both decrease, meaning h is the right end (higher x) and τ is the left end (lower x) for a left-moving car? No.\n\nIf a car is moving left, its front is decreasing x, so at time t, the front is at some x, back at x - L or something.\n\nIn the span definition, for left-moving, it says Span(t1) = [h, τ], and after time, [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so since both decrease, and h and τ are positions, if the car is moving left, h should be the position of the front when moving left, so front has higher x if x increases right, but here h and τ, for freeway 1: (h, τ) = (-24, 11), but -24 < 11, so if [h, τ] = [-24, 11], that's from x=-24 to x=11, which is a large car, but moving left.\n\nThen at T, it becomes [ -24 - sΔT, 11 - sΔT ], so the whole thing shifts left.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, it says Span(t1) = [τ, h] for some, but in the table it's listed as (h, τ, dir, s), so for right-moving, (h, τ) and Span(t1) = [τ, h]? Let's see the text.\n\n\"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\"\n\n\"Right-moving: [Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\"\n\nBut in the car state table, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), so for both, it's (head, tail), but the span is defined differently based on direction.\n\nFor left-moving, head is h, tail is τ, and span is [h, τ] with h and τ such that for moving left, h is the right end? In the example, freeway 1: (-24, 11, left, 36), so h = -24, τ = 11, and [h, τ] = [-24, 11], which is from x=-24 to x=11, length 35, moving left.\n\nAt T, span is [ -24 -36ΔT, 11-36ΔT], so it moves left at 36 units per turn.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, e.g. freeway 3: (18,7,right,6), but for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h], so τ is tail, h is head? In the text it says for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nIn the table, it's (head, tail), so for right-moving, head h is the front, tail τ is the back, so span should be from τ to h if moving right, so [τ, h], yes.\n\nSo for (18,7,right,6), head=18, tail=7, so span at t1 is [τ, h] = [7,18], moving right.\n\nSimilarly, for ( -18,-29,right,6), head= -18, tail= -29, so span [τ, h] = [-29, -18], moving right.\n\nAnd (60,49,right,6), span [49,60].\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if I am on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nI need to be at (0,9), which is freeway y=9, but freeways are from y=1 to y=8, so y=9 is above, no cars, so once I reach y=9, I'm safe, and since it's vertical position, at (0,9), I'm on y=9, no freeway below, so no collision possible.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are boundaries, I think y=0 is the bottom, y=9 top, freeways y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\nAt y=0 and y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nNow, I start at y=4 at t=14.\n\nI need to go to y=9, so I need to move up 5 steps, but I have to avoid the cars on the way.\n\nSince I can move up, down, or stay, but I want minimal turns, so I should move up as much as possible, but I have to avoid being on a freeway when a car covers x=0.\n\nAlso, I can stay or move down to wait, but that would increase H, so probably not optimal unless necessary.\n\nH is the number of turns, so I want to reach y=9 in min steps.\n\nEach move up increases y by 1, so minimum 5 moves up, but I might need to stay or move down to avoid collision, which adds turns.\n\nThe minimal H is at least 5, but could be more.\n\nNow, let's list the cars for each freeway at t=14.\n\nFreeway y=1: one car: (-24,11,left,36) so span at t=14: [-24,11]\n\nSince moving left at speed 36, at time T, span: [-24 -36(T-14), 11-36(T-14)]\n\nCollision if I am on y=1 at T and 0 in span, so -24 -36ΔT <= 0 <= 11-36ΔT for some ΔT = T-14.\n\nSimilarly, freeway y=2: same as y=1? (-24,11,left,36), identical.\n\ny=2: (-24,11,left,36), same as y=1.\n\nNow y=3: three cars: (18,7,right,6), (-18,-29,right,6), (60,49,right,6)\n\nFor each, at t=14:\n\nFirst car: head=18, tail=7, right, so span [7,18]\n\nAt T: [7 +6ΔT, 18+6ΔT]\n\nSecond car: head=-18, tail=-29, right, span [-29,-18]\n\nAt T: [-29+6ΔT, -18+6ΔT]\n\nThird car: head=60, tail=49, right, span [49,60]\n\nAt T: [49+6ΔT, 60+6ΔT]\n\nSimilarly, y=4: same as y=3: (18,7,right,6), (-18,-29,right,6), (60,49,right,6)\n\ny=5: only one car: (18,7,right,6)\n\ny=6: (18,7,right,6)\n\ny=7: (18,7,right,6)\n\ny=8: (18,7,right,6)\n\nAll freeways from y=3 to y=8 have cars, but y=3 and y=4 have three cars each, y=5 to y=8 have one car each.\n\ny=1 and y=2 have one car each, but it's a big fast left-moving car.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=4 to y=9.\n\nSince y=9 has no cars, I just need to reach it.\n\nBut to move up, I need to pass through y=5,6,7,8, each of which has cars that might cover x=0 at some times.\n\nSimilarly, I could stay or move down to avoid bad times.\n\nBut let's find when each freeway is dangerous, i.e., when 0 is covered by a car on that freeway.\n\nFor a given freeway k, at time T, if 0 is in some car's span on k.\n\nThen, if I am on k at T, collision.\n\nI need to be on k only when 0 is not in any span for k at that time.\n\nNow, since the cars move, I need to compute for each k, the times when it is occupied at x=0.\n\nFirst, let's handle the freeways one by one.\n\nStart with y=1.\n\nCar: left, speed 36, span at t=14: [-24,11]\n\nAt T, span: [-24 -36ΔT, 11-36ΔT] where ΔT = T-14\n\n0 in span if -24 -36ΔT <= 0 <= 11-36ΔT\n\nLeft inequality: -24 -36ΔT <= 0 => -36ΔT <= 24 => multiply by -1, reverse inequality: 36ΔT >= -24 => ΔT >= -24/36 = -2/3, but since ΔT >=0, this is always true for T>=14.\n\n-24 -36ΔT <= 0 => -36ΔT <= 24 => divide by -36, reverse: ΔT >= 24/36? Let's solve:\n\n-24 -36ΔT <= 0 => -36ΔT <= 24 => now divide both sides by -36, inequality reverses: ΔT >= 24/36? 24/36 = 2/3.\n\n-36ΔT <= 24, divide by -36, so ΔT >= 24/36? No:\n\n-36ΔT <= 24\n\nDivide both sides by -36, which is negative, so inequality flips: ΔT >= 24/36? 24/36 is 2/3, but:\n\n-36ΔT <= 24\n\nDivide by -36: ΔT >= 24 / (-36) ? No:\n\nWhen dividing inequality by negative number, flip.\n\nSo -36ΔT <= 24\n\nDivide both sides by -36: ΔT >= 24 / (-36) ? 24 / (-36) = -24/36 = -2/3\n\nBut ΔT = T-14 >=0, so ΔT >= -2/3 is always true since ΔT >=0.\n\nSimilarly, right inequality: 0 <= 11 -36ΔT => 36ΔT <= 11 => ΔT <= 11/36\n\nSo 0 in span only if ΔT <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305, so for T such that T-14 <= 11/36, so T <= 14 + 11/36 ≈ 14.305\n\nSince turns are integer, T=14 or less, but T=14 is current turn, and I am at y=4, not on y=1, so at T=14, for y=1, 0 in span? At T=14, ΔT=0, span [-24,11], 0 between -24 and 11, yes, so at T=14, if I were on y=1, collision, but I am not.\n\nFor T>14, ΔT >=1, ΔT <=11/36 <1, so for T>=15, ΔT >=1 > 11/36, so 0 <= 11-36ΔT is false, so 0 not in span for T>=15.\n\nSimilarly, from left inequality, it was always true for T>=14.\n\nSo for y=1, 0 in span only at T=14, and since I am not on y=1 at T=14, it is safe for all T>=15. So after t=14, y=1 is always safe, no car at x=0.\n\nAt T=14, it is occupied, but I am not there.\n\nFor T=15, ΔT=1, span [-24-36, 11-36] = [-60,-25], 0 not in [-60,-25], so yes, safe.\n\nSimilarly for higher T.\n\nSo y=1 is safe for all future turns after t=14.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 has the same car, same situation: occupied only at T=14, safe for T>=15.\n\nSo freeways y=1 and y=2 are safe to be on for any turn T>=15.\n\nNow, y=3 to y=8.\n\nFirst, y=3: three cars.\n\nCar1: (18,7,right,6) span at t=14: [7,18] since right, span [τ,h] = [7,18]\n\nAt T: [7+6ΔT, 18+6ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 7+6ΔT <= 0 <= 18+6ΔT\n\nBut 7+6ΔT >=7 >0 for ΔT>=0, so 0 <= 18+6ΔT always true, but 7+6ΔT <=0? 7+6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <= -7, impossible since ΔT>=0. So never true. So car1 never covers x=0.\n\nSimilarly, car2: (-18,-29,right,6) span at t=14: [τ,h] = [-29,-18] since tail=-29, head=-18\n\nAt T: [-29+6ΔT, -18+6ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -29+6ΔT <= 0 <= -18+6ΔT\n\nLeft: -29+6ΔT <= 0 => 6ΔT <= 29 => ΔT <= 29/6 ≈ 4.833\n\nRight: 0 <= -18+6ΔT => 6ΔT >= 18 => ΔT >= 3\n\nSo for ΔT from 3 to 4.833, so T=17,18,19? ΔT=3,4,5? Let's see:\n\nΔT >=3 and ΔT <=29/6≈4.833, so ΔT=3,4 since 5>4.833.\n\nΔT=3: T=14+3=17\n\nΔT=4: T=18\n\nΔT=5: 6*5=30>29, so -29+30=1, -18+30=12, span [1,12], 0 not <=1? 0 <=1 is true? 0 <=1 and 1<=0? No.\n\n0 in [a,b] if a<=0<=b.\n\nAt ΔT=3: [-29+18, -18+18] = [-11,0], so -11<=0<=0? 0<=0 is true, so yes.\n\nAt ΔT=4: [-29+24, -18+24] = [-5,6], -5<=0<=6, yes.\n\nAt ΔT=5: [-29+30, -18+30] = [1,12], 1<=0<=12? 0>=1 false, so no.\n\nSimilarly, ΔT=2: [-29+12, -18+12] = [-17,-6], -17<=0<=-6? 0 <= -6 false.\n\nSo car2 covers x=0 at T=17 and T=18.\n\nNow car3: (60,49,right,6) span [49,60] at t=14\n\nAt T: [49+6ΔT, 60+6ΔT], both positive, min 49>0, so 0 never in span.\n\nSo for y=3, only car2 can cause issue at T=17 and T=18.\n\nAt other times, no car covers x=0.\n\nSimilarly, for y=4, same cars as y=3, so same situation: occupied at T=17 and T=18.\n\ny=4 has the same three cars, so yes, same as y=3.\n\nNow y=5: only one car: (18,7,right,6) same as car1 on y=3, which never covers x=0, as we saw.\n\nSpan [7,18] at t=14, at T [7+6ΔT,18+6ΔT], always positive, so never covers x=0.\n\nSo y=5 is always safe, no car at x=0 ever.\n\nSimilarly, y=6: same car (18,7,right,6), always safe.\n\ny=7: same, always safe.\n\ny=8: same, always safe.\n\ny=8 has (18,7,right,6), which is always away from 0.\n\nBut y=3 and y=4 are only dangerous at T=17 and 18.\n\ny=1 and y=2 are safe after t=14.\n\ny=5 to y=8 are always safe.\n\nBut I start at y=4 at t=14.\n\nAt t=14, I am on y=4.\n\nNow, for y=4, at t=14, is it occupied?\n\nAt t=14, for y=4, cars: car1 [7,18], car2 [-29,-18], car3 [49,60], none includes 0, since -29 to -18, 7 to18, etc., 0 not in any, so at t=14, y=4 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways.\n\nBut at t=17 and 18, y=3 and y=4 are occupied.\n\nNow, I need to get to y=9.\n\nSince y=5 to y=8 are always safe, I can move up directly, but I have to be careful not to be on y=3 or y=4 at t=17 or 18.\n\ny=3 and y=4 are dangerous only at t=17 and t=18.\n\nAt other times, they are safe.\n\nNow, I start at t=14, y=4.\n\nI can move up to y=5, y=6, etc., but if I stay on y=4 or go to y=3, I need to avoid t=17,18.\n\nBut since I want to go up, probably better to move up quickly.\n\nMinimal steps: I need to go from y=4 to y=9, difference 5, so at least 5 up moves.\n\nEach move takes one turn, but I can do multiple actions.\n\nThe sequence of actions: at each turn, I choose U, D, or S, which changes y for next turn.\n\nLet me denote the turn and y position.\n\nStart: turn t=14, y=4.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn, say at turn T, y_T =9.\n\nThen H = T - 14 + 1? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is from t=14 to t=14+H-1, and after H turns, at turn t=14+H-1, y=9.\n\nAfter H actions, from t=14 to t=14+H-1, y at turn t=14+H-1 is 9.\n\nAnd actions from a_{14} to a_{14+H-1}.\n\nAt turn t, I perform action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\ny_{t+1} is set at turn t.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position (0, y_t), and I choose a_t, then y_{t+1} is computed, and at turn t+1, I am at (0, y_{t+1}).\n\nCollision at turn t if y_t is between 1 and 8, and 0 in some car span on y_t at time t.\n\nFor turn t, I am on freeway y_t, and check cars on y_t at time t.\n\nIn this case, at t=14, y=4, and as above, no collision, safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is safe always.\n\nNow, the dangerous times are for y=3 and y=4 at t=17 and t=18.\n\nThat is, if I am on y=3 or y=4 at turn 17 or 18, collision.\n\nOther freeways are safe.\n\ny=5 to y=8 are always safe, y=1 and y=2 safe after t=14.\n\nBut since I start at y=4 and go up, I won't go to y=1 or 2.\n\nSo I only need to worry about being on y=3 or y=4 at t=17 or t=18.\n\nI should avoid being on y=3 or y=4 at turns 17 and 18.\n\nNow, at t=14, I am at y=4.\n\nI can choose to move up, down, or stay.\n\nIf I move up at t=14, then at t=15, I am at y=5.\n\nThen from y=5, I can keep moving up.\n\ny=5 is safe always, so I can go to y=6 at t=16, y=7 at t=17, y=8 at t=18, y=9 at t=19.\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt t=15, y=5, safe.\n\nt=16, y=6, safe.\n\nt=17, y=7, which is safe, since y=7 no car at x=0.\n\nt=18, y=8, safe.\n\nt=19, y=9, safe.\n\nAnd I reach y=9 at t=19.\n\nH: from t=14 to t=18, that's 5 actions: a14 to a18, and at t=19, y=9? Let's see the turns.\n\nt=14: start, y=4\n\nAfter a14, y15 = y14 + Δy\n\nIf a14=U, y15=5\n\na15=U, y16=6\n\na16=U, y17=7\n\na17=U, y18=8\n\na18=U, y19=9\n\nSo at turn t=19, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=14 to t=18, that's 5 actions (t=14,15,16,17,18), and after last action, at t=19, y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns for actions, so {a_t for t=14 to 14+H-1}, and at turn 14+H-1, y=9? No.\n\nAfter H actions, the position is at turn t=14 + H.\n\nAt turn t, before action, y_t is current.\n\nAfter choosing a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nAfter H actions, we have y_{14+H}.\n\nWe want y_{14+H} =9.\n\nThe actions are from t=14 to t=14+H-1, so H actions.\n\nAfter that, at turn 14+H, y=9.\n\nIn this case, with 5 up moves, H=5, actions at t=14,15,16,17,18, y19=9.\n\nt=19 = 14 + 5.\n\nNow, at no point was I on y=3 or y=4 at t=17 or 18.\n\nAt t=17, I was on y=7, safe.\n\nt=18, y=8, safe.\n\nAnd earlier turns, no issue.\n\nBut y=3 and y=4 are dangerous only at t=17,18, but I left y=4 at t=14, so at t=15, I am at y=5, etc., not on y=4 at later turns except if I go back.\n\nSo this seems fine.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nMinimal H=5, since I need 5 up moves.\n\nCan I do it in less than 5? No, because I start at y=4, need to reach y=9, each up move increases y by 1, so min 5 moves, H min 5.\n\nH is number of actions, each action can change y by at most 1, so yes, min H=5.\n\nIn this sequence, with all U, I reach in 5 turns.\n\nBut do I collide? At t=14, I am on y=4, and it's safe, as we saw.\n\nThen I move up each turn.\n\nNow, at t=17, I am on y=7, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly t=18, y=8 safe.\n\nBut let me confirm the car positions.\n\nFor example, at t=17, for y=7, car is (18,7,right,6), at t=14, span [7,18], at t=17, ΔT=3, [7+18,18+18]= [25,36]? ΔT=T-14, at T=17, ΔT=3, span [7+6*3, 18+6*3] = [7+18,18+18]=[25,36], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 same.\n\nAnd y=3 and y=4 are occupied at t=17, but I am not there.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nSimilarly, I can reach in 5 turns.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nIn this case, all actions U from t=14 to t=18.\n\nBut t=14 to t=18 inclusive? Actions a14 to a18.\n\na14: U, to y15=5\n\na15: U, y16=6\n\na16: U, y17=7\n\na17: U, y18=8\n\na18: U, y19=9\n\nAnd y19=9.\n\nNow, but let me check if I can be faster? No, min 5.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier, but I start at t=14, y=4, after one action at t=14, y15 could be 3,4,5.\n\nIf I go to y15=5, then at t=15, y=5, then I can go to y=6 at t=16, y=7 at t=17, y=8 at t=18, y=9 at t=19, same as above.\n\nIf at t=14 I go down to y=3, but y=3 might be safe at t=14, but then I need to go up later, which might take more turns.\n\nFor example, if I go down to y=3 at t=14, then y15=3.\n\nThen at t=15, I am on y=3.\n\nNow, at t=15, for y=3, is it occupied?\n\nEarlier, for y=3, occupied only at t=17 and 18.\n\nAt t=15, ΔT=1, car2 span: at T=15, ΔT=1, [-29+6(1), -18+6(1)] = [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\ncar1 and car3 not, so safe.\n\nThen I can go up to y=4 at t=16? From y=3, if I go up at t=15, y16=4.\n\nThen at t=16, on y=4.\n\nt=16, ΔT=2, y=4 car2 span: [-29+12, -18+12] = [-17,-6], 0 not in, safe.\n\nBut now at t=17, if I am on y=4, occupied, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay or something.\n\nBut in this case, if I go down to y=3 at t=14, then at t=15 on y=3, safe, then I need to avoid y=3 and y=4 at t=17,18.\n\nSo I could go up to y=4 at t=15? At t=15, from y=3, if a15=U, y16=4.\n\nThen at t=16 on y=4.\n\nBut at t=17, if I am on y=4, collision.\n\nSo I need to leave y=4 before t=17.\n\nFor example, at t=16, I could go up to y=5, so at t=16, action a16=U, then y17=5.\n\nThen at t=17, I am on y=5, which is safe.\n\nThen continue up.\n\nBut let's see the sequence:\n\nt=14: a14=D, y15=3 (since down)\n\nt=15: a15=U, y16=4\n\nt=16: a16=U, y17=5\n\nThen t=17: a17=U, y18=6\n\nt=18: a18=U, y19=7, not 9.\n\ny19=7, I need to go to y=9, so I need more actions.\n\na19=U, y20=8\n\na20=U, y21=9\n\nSo at t=21, y=9, H=7 actions from t=14 to 20, worse than before.\n\nIf at t=16 I go up, y17=5, then at t=17 on y=5, safe, but I need to reach y=9.\n\ny17=5, then to y=9, need 4 more up, so t=21 y=9.\n\nEven worse.\n\nAfter being on y=3 at t=15, I could stay or something, but to avoid t=17,18 on y=3 or 4.\n\nFor example, at t=15, on y=3, instead of going up, I go down to y=2? But y=2 is safe after t=14.\n\ny15=3, a15=D, y16=2\n\nThen at t=16 on y=2, safe.\n\nThen at t=16, I can go up, but to y=3, but at t=17, y=3 occupied, so I need to not be on y=3 at t=17.\n\nSo at t=16, from y=2, if a16=U, y17=3, then at t=17 on y=3, collision.\n\nIf a16=S, y17=2, then at t=17 on y=2, safe, but not progressing.\n\nThen later I need to go up.\n\nBut all this takes more turns.\n\nSo the direct up is better.\n\nPerhaps I can stay at y=4 for some turns, but since y=4 is dangerous at t=17,18, I need to leave before.\n\nFor example, at t=14, I stay, a14=S, y15=4\n\nThen at t=15 on y=4, which is safe since t=15 not 17 or 18.\n\nThen at t=15, I can go up to y=5, a15=U, y16=5\n\nThen at t=16 on y=5, safe.\n\nThen a16=U, y17=6, safe, and so on, to y19=9 with a18=U.\n\nBut same as first sequence, H=5.\n\nIf I stay at t=14, y15=4, then at t=15, I go up, etc., same as if I moved up at t=14.\n\nIn first sequence, I moved up at t=14 to y=5 at t=15.\n\nIf I stay at t=14, I am at y=4 at t=15, then move up at t=15 to y=5 at t=16, so I reach y=9 later.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=14: a14=S, y15=4\n\nt=15: a15=U, y16=5\n\nt=16: a16=U, y17=6\n\nt=17: a17=U, y18=7\n\nt=18: a18=U, y19=8\n\nt=19: a19=U, y20=9\n\nSo at t=20, y=9, H=6 actions, worse.\n\nIf I move up immediately.\n\nSo best is to move up each turn starting from t=14.\n\nBut in the first plan, with a14=U, y15=5; a15=U, y16=6; a16=U, y17=7; a17=U, y18=8; a18=U, y19=9. H=5.\n\nNow, but at t=17 and t=18, I am on y=7 and y=8, safe.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier? For example, if I could be at y=9 at t=18 or something, but from y=4, min 5 steps, so at t=19 is earliest.\n\nt=14 start y=4, after 0 actions, y=4.\n\nAfter 1 action, y=3,4, or5 at t=15.\n\nAfter 2 actions, y=2,3,4,5,6 at t=16.\n\nAfter 3 actions, y=1 to7 at t=17.\n\nAfter 4 actions, y=0 to8 at t=18.\n\nAfter 5 actions, y=0 to9 at t=19.\n\nSo earliest to be at y=9 is t=19, with exactly 5 up moves, no down or stay.\n\nSo H=5 is minimal.\n\nNow, in this sequence, I need to ensure that during the path, no collision.\n\nAt t=14, y=4, safe.\n\nt=15, y=5, safe as we said.\n\nt=16, y=6, safe.\n\nt=17, y=7, safe.\n\nt=18, y=8, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut y=7 and y=8 have cars, but they never cover x=0, as per earlier.\n\nFor example, y=7 car: (18,7,right,6), at any T, span min at T=14 [7,18], all positive, so never covers 0.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\ny=6 same.\n\ny=5 same.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the sequence should be all U for 5 turns.\n\nBut let me write the actions.\n\nTurn t=14: a_{14} = U\n\nTurn t=15: a_{15} = U\n\nTurn t=16: a_{16} = U\n\nTurn t=17: a_{17} = U\n\nTurn t=18: a_{18} = U\n\nThen at turn t=19, y=9.\n\nIn the answer format, it should be from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nt_1 =14, H=5, so actions from t=14 to t=18.\n\nAnd each action U.\n\nBut in the collision note, it says: if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will not be considered on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nIn this case, when I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, not on y_{T+1}.\n\nIn my sequence, for example, at t=17, I am on y=7, and I perform U, so y_{18}=8, but at turn t=17, I am on y=7, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=18, I am on y=8, perform U, y_{19}=9.\n\nNo issue.\n\nPerhaps I should confirm if at any point I might be on a freeway when occupied.\n\nBut as above, no.\n\nAnother thing: for y=3 and y=4, occupied at t=17 and 18, but I am not there at those times.\n\nAt t=16, y=6, not on y=3 or 4.\n\nt=17, y=7.\n\nSo fine.\n\nBut in the car state, for y=3 and y=4, there is a car that covers at t=17 and 18, but since I am not on that freeway, no collision.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nSo for turn t_1=14, actions:\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nIn the answer, it should be written as:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} which is U for t=14\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 +1} = U for t=15\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + 4: a_{t_1 +4} = U for t=18\n\nSince H=5, t from 0 to H-1=4, so t_1 to t_1+4.\n\nIn the sequence, t from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nSo for H=5, actions at t_1, t_1+1, t_1+2, t_1+3, t_1+4.\n\nThen position at t_1 + H = t_1 +5 =19, y=9.\n\nNow, but let me make sure about the car on y=3 and y=4 at t=17.\n\nFor example, at t=17, for y=4, car2: at T=17, ΔT=3, span [-29+18, -18+18] = [-11,0], so [ -11, 0], and 0 is included, since a<=0<=b with a=-11, b=0, so 0<=0 true, so yes, occupied.\n\nSimilarly, if I were on y=4 at t=17, collision.\n\nBut I am not.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 same.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 5 with all up actions.\n\nBut in the output, it should be in the box.\n\nBut the initial position is (0,4), and I need to reach (0,9), which I do.\n\nPerhaps I can consider if staying or down could help, but it only delays.\n\nFor example, if I stay at t=14, then I am at y=4 at t=15, which is safe, then I can move up, but as before, it takes one extra turn to reach y=9.\n\nSimilarly, not better.\n\nSo I think this is optimal.\n\nBut let me check the cars again.\n\nFor y=5 to 8, only one car each, (18,7,right,6), which is always away.\n\nBut for y=3 and 4, there is car2 which comes to 0.\n\nBut I avoid it.\n\nAnother thing: at t=14, I am at y=4, and I move immediately up.\n\nBut in the sequence, I start moving at t=14.\n\nNow, the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\end{array} } \n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., and t_1=14.\n\nSo in the box.\n\nBut let me write it properly.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 4) at turn \\(t_1 = 14\\) and aims to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The minimum number of turns \\(H\\) required to move from \\(y = 4\\) to \\(y = 9\\) is 5, as each \"up\" action increases \\(y\\) by 1, and no fewer actions can achieve the necessary vertical displacement.\n- Freeways \\(y = 1\\) and \\(y = 2\\) are safe for all turns after \\(t = 14\\) (i.e., \\(t \\geq 15\\)), as the cars on these freeways only cover \\(x = 0\\) at \\(t = 14\\), and the player is not on these freeways at that time.\n- Freeways \\(y = 3\\) and \\(y = 4\\) are dangerous at turns \\(t = 17\\) and \\(t = 18\\) due to car spans covering \\(x = 0\\) at these times.

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 5) on turn t_1 = 15. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays with actions U, D, S, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. Importantly, when moving to a new y, at turn T, the player is only on y_T, not y_{T+1}, so we don't care about cars on the target row until the next turn.\n\nNow, the car states are given for each freeway. Freeways are y=1 to 8, and for each, there are cars with (head, tail, direction, speed). Direction: left or right, which determines how the span moves.\n\nLet me list out the cars for each freeway clearly:\n\n- Freeway 1 (y=1): one car: head=-60, tail=-25, direction=left, speed=36\n\n- Freeway 2 (y=2): similarly, one car: head=-60, tail=-25, direction=left, speed=36\n\n- Freeway 3 (y=3): three cars: (24,13,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6), (-48,-59,right,6)\n\n- Freeway 4 (y=4): same as y=3: (24,13,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6), (-48,-59,right,6)\n\n- Freeway 5 (y=5): one car: (24,13,right,6)\n\n- Freeway 6 (y=6): one car: (24,13,right,6)\n\n- Freeway 7 (y=7): one car: (24,13,right,6)\n\n- Freeway 8 (y=8): one car: (24,13,right,6)\n\nFor freeways 3 and 4, there are three cars each, but for 5,6,7,8 only one each with the same parameters.\n\nNow, the car spans move over time. Since we're starting at turn t_1=15, and we need to find actions for turns starting from t_1.\n\nThe car positions at any future turn T can be calculated based on the initial state at t_1.\n\nFor a car, at turn T, the span is:\n\nIf direction left: [h - s*(T - t_1), τ - s*(T - t_1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, head and tail decrease.\n\nIn the notation, for left-moving, span(t_1) = [h, τ], and since it's left, head is larger, tail smaller? Let's see the example.\n\nFor freeway 1: head=-60, tail=-25, direction left.\n\nAt t_1=15, span is [h, τ] = [-60, -25]. Since direction left, as time increases, both head and tail decrease, so at time T, span is [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h]? In the car update:\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn the table, for freeway 3, cars are given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For the first car: (24,13,right,6)\n\nBut in the span notation, for right-moving, it says \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" which might be confusing.\n\nLet's read carefully:\n\n\"Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nAnd for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, ...), so for consistency, I think \"head\" and \"tail\" are defined such that for left-moving, head is the front when moving left, so higher number? But in coordinates, moving left means decreasing x.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think in terms of the position.\n\nFor a left-moving car, at t_1, the span covers from left to right, but since it's moving left, the head is on the right, tail on left? I'm getting confused.\n\nLet's look at freeway 1: head=-60, tail=-25, direction left.\n\nAt t_1, span [h, τ] = [-60, -25]. Since it's left-moving, as time goes, both decrease, so the car is moving to more negative x.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, like freeway 3 car: (24,13,right,6), and span(t_1) = [τ, h] for right? But in the input, it's (head, tail), so for right-moving, head is the front when moving right, so lower number? Head=24, tail=13, but 24 > 13, so if moving right, head should be smaller? I think there's inconsistency.\n\nIn the car update for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" and then moves to higher numbers.\n\nFor the car (24,13,right,6), at t_1, span is [τ, h] = [13, 24]? But it says (head, tail) = (24,13), so head=24, tail=13.\n\nBut in the span notation for right-moving, it uses [τ, h], which would be [tail, head] = [13,24] for this car.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, span [h, τ] = [-60,-25] for freeway 1.\n\nSo, to avoid confusion, I should think of the span as an interval [min, max] at each time.\n\nFor collision, we care if 0 is in the span at turn T for the freeway we are on.\n\nAlso, the player is at x=0 always, since moving vertically only.\n\nNow, for the player, at turn T, if we are on freeway y, we collide if for that y, there is a car with 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nWhen we move, at turn T, after action, we are on y_{T}, so we check collision for y_T at turn T.\n\nIf we change y, at turn T, we are on old y, not new y.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nSo, collision only depends on the current row at the current turn.\n\nNow, we start at y=5 on turn 15.\n\nGoal is to reach y=9.\n\nSince we can only change y by at most 1 per turn, the minimum number of turns to go from y=5 to y=9 is 4 turns, if we go up each time: U,U,U,U, to 6,7,8,9.\n\nBut we need to check if this is possible without collision, considering the cars on rows 5,6,7,8.\n\nWe start on row 5 at turn 15, so we need to check row 5 at turn 15 for collision.\n\nThen if we move to row 6 at turn 16, we check row 6 at turn 16, and so on.\n\nBut we also need to consider if staying or moving down is necessary to avoid cars.\n\nFirst, let's list the car spans for each freeway at different turns.\n\nDefine t = T - t_1, so at t=0, current turn.\n\nt_1=15, so for turn T, t = T - 15.\n\nThen for a car, span at time t (relative) is:\n\nFor left-moving: [h - s*t, τ - s*t]\n\nFor right-moving: [τ + s*t, h + s*t]  because for right, Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)] = [τ + s*t, h + s*t]\n\nAnd collision if 0 in [min, max] for that freeway at that turn.\n\nNow, for each freeway, cars:\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): one car, left, s=36, h=-60, τ=-25 at t=0.\n\nSo span at time t: [ -60 - 36t, -25 - 36t ]\n\n0 in span if -60 -36t <= 0 <= -25 -36t\n\nBut since -60-36t <= -25-36t < 0 for all t>=0, because both negative and decreasing, so 0 never in span. So no collision possible on freeway 1 at any time.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 (y=2): same car, left, s=36, h=-60, τ=-25, same as above, span [ -60-36t, -25-36t ] always negative, so 0 never in span, no collision.\n\nNow freeway 3 (y=3): three cars, all right-moving, s=6.\n\nFirst car: (head=24, tail=13, right, s=6) at t=0.\n\nFor right-moving, span at t: [τ + s*t, h + s*t] = [13 + 6t, 24 + 6t]\n\nSecond car: (head=-12, tail=-23? Wait, tail=-23? In the table: (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nhead=-12, tail=-23? But tail should be less than head for right-moving? head=-12, tail=-23, so since moving right, head is front, so if head=-12, tail=-23, that means tail is left of head, so span from τ to h is [-23, -12] at t=0.\n\nThen at time t, [τ + s*t, h + s*t] = [-23 + 6t, -12 + 6t]\n\nSimilarly, third car: (-48,-59,right,6), head=-48, tail=-59, so span at t: [-59 + 6t, -48 + 6t]\n\nNow, for freeway 3, we need to check if 0 in any of these spans at a given t.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 4 (y=4): same as y=3, three cars with same parameters.\n\nFirst car: [13 + 6t, 24 + 6t]\n\nSecond car: [-23 + 6t, -12 + 6t]\n\nThird car: [-59 + 6t, -48 + 6t]\n\n0 in first span: 13+6t <= 0 <= 24+6t ? Since 13+6t >0 for t>=0, 0 < lower bound, so never.\n\n13+6t >=13>0, so min>0, 0 not in [min,max] since min>0.\n\nSimilarly, third car: [-59+6t, -48+6t], min=-59+6t, max=-48+6t.\n\nAt t=0, [-59,-48], both negative, so min<0<max? max=-48<0? -48 is negative, so max<0, so min<max<0, so 0 not in span.\n\nAs t increases, min and max increase, but when does max>=0? -48+6t >=0 when 6t>=48, t>=8.\n\nSimilarly, min<=0 when -59+6t<=0, t<=59/6≈9.833.\n\nBut for 0 to be in span, need min<=0 and max>=0.\n\nmin = -59+6t <=0 for t<=9.833, max=-48+6t>=0 for t>=8.\n\nSo for t=8,9,10? t integer.\n\nt=8: min=-59+48= -11, max=-48+48=0, so span [-11,0], 0 is included? max=0, so 0 in span.\n\n[ min, max] = [-11,0], so 0 is the upper bound, so yes, 0 in span.\n\nSimilarly t=9: min=-59+54= -5, max=-48+54=6, so [-5,6], 0 in span.\n\nt=10: min=-59+60=1, max=-48+60=12, min=1>0, so not.\n\nSo for third car, 0 in span when t=8,9.\n\nBut for freeway 3, we have multiple cars.\n\nFirst car: [13+6t,24+6t], min=13+6t >=13>0, so never 0 in span.\n\nSecond car: [-23+6t, -12+6t]\n\nmin=-23+6t, max=-12+6t\n\nmin<=0 when -23+6t<=0, t<=23/6≈3.833\n\nmax>=0 when -12+6t>=0, t>=2\n\nSo for t=2,3,4? t integer.\n\nt=2: min=-23+12= -11, max=-12+12=0, span [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nt=3: min=-23+18= -5, max=-12+18=6, [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nt=4: min=-23+24=1, max=-12+24=12, min=1>0, not.\n\nSo second car: 0 in span at t=2,3.\n\nThird car: at t=8,9 as above.\n\nNow for freeway 3, collision if at any turn, for y=3, 0 in any car span.\n\nSo at t=2,3 (relative to t1=15, so turns 17,18), and t=8,9 (turns 23,24), there might be collision if player is on y=3 at those turns.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 4, same cars, same situation.\n\nNow freeway 5 (y=5): one car (24,13,right,6)\n\nSo at t=0, head=24, tail=13, right, s=6\n\nSpan at t: [τ + s t, h + s t] = [13 + 6t, 24 + 6t]\n\nmin=13+6t >=13>0, so never 0 in span, so no collision on freeway 5 at any time.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6 (y=6): same, one car (24,13,right,6), span [13+6t,24+6t] >0, no collision.\n\nFreeway 7 (y=7): same, no collision.\n\nFreeway 8 (y=8): same, no collision.\n\nFreeways 5,6,7,8 all have only one car each, with head=24, tail=13, right, s=6, so span [13+6t,24+6t] always positive and increasing, min>0, so 0 never in span, no collision possible on rows 5,6,7,8.\n\nIs that right? At t=0, [13,24], both positive, and increases, so yes, 0 not in span ever.\n\nBut the player is starting on row 5 at turn 15, which is t=0.\n\nAt t=0, for row 5, car span [13,24], 0 not in it, so no collision at start.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nBut rows 3 and 4 have possible collisions at certain times.\n\nNow, the player needs to go from y=5 to y=9.\n\nSince rows 5,6,7,8 have no cars that can cause collision (as spans never include 0), and row 1 and 2 also no collision, only rows 3 and 4 have potential collisions.\n\nBut the player starts on 5, and needs to reach 9, so must pass through 6,7,8, but since no danger on 5,6,7,8, we can just go up directly.\n\nBut row 3 and 4 are below, and we are starting from 5, going up, so we might not need to go to row 3 or 4, unless we move down.\n\nThe minimal path is to go up: from 5 to 6 to 7 to 8 to 9.\n\nEach step, we move up at each turn.\n\nStart at turn 15, y=5.\n\nAction at turn 15: U, then at turn 16, y=6.\n\nThen turn 16: U, turn 17 y=7.\n\nTurn 17: U, turn 18 y=8.\n\nTurn 18: U, turn 19 y=9. Reached in 4 turns.\n\nNow, need to check for collision at each step.\n\nAt turn 15: we are on y=5. Row 5 has car with span at t=0: [13+6*0,24+6*0]=[13,24], 0 not in, no collision.\n\nAt turn 16: we are on y=6 (after moving up from turn 15 action). At turn 16, t=1 relative to t1=15? Turn T=16, t=T-15=1.\n\nOn y=6, row 6 car span at t=1: [13+6*1,24+6*1]=[19,30], 0 not in, no collision.\n\nAt turn 17: on y=7, t=2, row 7 car span [13+12,24+12]=[25,36], no collision.\n\nAt turn 18: on y=8, t=3, row 8 car span [13+18,24+18]=[31,42], no collision.\n\nAt turn 19: on y=9, but y=9 is not a freeway, it's the goal, and no cars on y=9, so no collision. We reach at turn 19.\n\nBut the sequence: actions from turn 15 to turn 18.\n\nLet's list:\n\nAt turn 15: action U, move to y=6 at turn 16? No.\n\nPlayer position: at turn T, after action, we are at y_T.\n\nStart turn 15, position (0,5).\n\nAfter action at turn 15, we move to new position for turn 16.\n\nThe update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nSo at turn t, we perform action, which determines Δy_t, so y_{t+1} is set.\n\nBut the position at turn t is given before action? The state is at turn t_1=15, position (0,5), so at turn 15, before action, we are at (0,5).\n\nThen we choose action a_{t_1} = a_{15}, which determines y_{16}.\n\nThen at turn 16, we are at y_{16}, and so on.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn T based on y_T.\n\nFor turn 15: we are on y=5, check collision for row 5 at turn 15 (t=0), which is safe, as above.\n\nThen action a_{15}: say U, so y_{16} = 5 +1 =6.\n\nNow at turn 16: we are on y=6, check collision for row 6 at turn 16 (t=1), span [19,30], 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction a_{16}: U, y_{17} =6+1=7.\n\nTurn 17: on y=7, check row 7 at turn 17 (t=2), span [25,36], safe.\n\nAction a_{17}: U, y_{18} =7+1=8.\n\nTurn 18: on y=8, check row 8 at turn 18 (t=3), span [31,42], safe.\n\nAction a_{18}: U, y_{19} =8+1=9.\n\nNow at turn 19: on y=9, which is not a freeway, so no cars, and we reached (0,9), so done.\n\nH=4 turns, from turn 15 to 18, actions at t=15,16,17,18.\n\nSequence: turn 15: U, turn 16: U, turn 17: U, turn 18: U.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H-1, with y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nHere t_1=15, H=4, so actions at turn 15,16,17,18, and at turn 18, after action, y_{19}=9, so position at turn 19 is (0,9).\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a_{15} to a_{18}.\n\nAnd we reached at turn 19.\n\nBut is turn 19 considered? The player reaches at turn 19, but the last action is at turn 18.\n\nIn the position, after H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H.\n\nBut the turn when we first reach y=9 is turn 19.\n\nIn the task: \"reach (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1\"? Let's see.\n\n\"determine minimal H and sequence {a_{t_1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nHere t_1=15, y_{15 + H -1} =9.\n\nIf H=4, y_{15+4-1}=y_{18}=9? But in my sequence, y_{18}=8, y_{19}=9.\n\ny_{18} is at turn 18, after action a_{17}, y_{18} is set.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn T, before action, position is (0, y_T).\n\nThen we choose action a_T, which sets y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nAfter action, for the next turn.\n\nIn the state, at turn t_1=15, we are given y_{t_1} =5.\n\nThen we choose a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., up to a_{t_1 + H -1}, such that after all actions, y_{t_1 + H} =9? No.\n\nAfter H actions, we have y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut the condition is y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} is the position at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nFor example, if H=1, y_{t_1 +1 -1} = y_{t_1} =9, but we start at 5, not 9, so H>1.\n\nGenerally, we need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAt turn t_1 + H -1, position is (0,9).\n\nIn terms of actions, we perform actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H -2? Let's think.\n\nAt turn t_1, position y_{t_1}.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, we go to y_{t_1 +1}.\n\nSimilarly, after a_{t_1 + k}, we go to y_{t_1 + k +1}.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} is set by the previous action.\n\nSpecifically, y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{t_1 + H -2} + Δy_{t_1 + H -2} from action a_{t_1 + H -2}.\n\nThe sequence of actions is a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, and y_{t_1 + H} is set after a_{t_1 + H -1}, but we don't care about y_{t_1 + H}, we care that at turn t_1 + H -1, position is 9.\n\nAt turn T, position is y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, we move to y_{T+1} for turn T+1.\n\nSo at turn T, position y_T.\n\nWe want for some T, y_T =9.\n\nSpecifically, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor example, to have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThe actions affect the next position.\n\nThe last action that sets y_{t_1 + H -1} is a_{t_1 + H -2}, because y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{t_1 + H -2} + Δy_{t_1 + H -2}.\n\nBut the sequence includes a_{t_1 + H -1}, which would set y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut we don't need to go beyond, since we reach at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nThe sequence has H actions: a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, and after these H actions, we have y_{t_1 + H}, but the position y_{t_1 + H -1} is achieved before the last action or after?\n\nI think I have confusion.\n\nLet me define:\n\n- At the beginning of turn T, position is (0, y_T)\n\n- We choose action a_T, which determines Δy_T, so y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T\n\n- Then for the next turn T+1, position is (0, y_{T+1})\n\nCollision is checked at turn T based on y_T and the car spans at turn T.\n\nWe start at turn t_1, position given.\n\nWe perform actions for turns t_1, t_1+1, ..., up to some point.\n\nWe want that at turn t_1 + H -1, y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nAnd we have performed H actions: from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}.\n\nFor example, to go from y_t1=5 to 9, minimum H such that after H-1 moves? Let's see.\n\nIf we do nothing, y stays, but we need to increase.\n\nThe number of up moves needed: from 5 to 9, difference 4, so we need at least 4 up actions.\n\nEach up action increases y by 1, so after k up actions, y increases by k.\n\nBut y is set after the action.\n\nStart at turn t_1: y_{t_1} =5\n\nAfter a_{t_1}, y_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{t_1} + sum_{k=0}^{H-2} Δy_{t_1 + k}  because y_{t_1 + m} for m=1 to H-1 is set by actions from t_1 to t_1 + m -1.\n\nSet m = H-1, so y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{t_1} + sum_{k=0}^{H-2} Δy_{t_1 + k}\n\nAnd this equals 9.\n\nSince y_{t_1} =5, so sum_{k=0}^{H-2} Δy_{t_1 + k} =4.\n\nEach Δy is +1,0,-1, so to have sum=4, we need at least 4 steps where Δy=+1, and no down, but we can have stay or down, but that would require more actions.\n\nMinimal H when we have exactly 4 up actions and no other actions, so H-1 actions? The sum is from k=0 to H-2, that's H-1 terms? k from 0 to H-2 inclusive is (H-2)-0+1 = H-1 terms.\n\nIndices: k=0 to H-2, number of terms: (H-2) - 0 + 1 = H-1 terms.\n\nEach Δy can be -1,0,1.\n\nWe need sum of H-1 terms to be 4.\n\nSo minimal when all +1, so H-1 =4, thus H=5.\n\nThen sum of 4 terms each +1, sum=4.\n\nThen y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{t_1} + sum =5 +4=9.\n\nWith H=5, actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 +4}, and y_{t_1 +4} =9? Let's see.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = t_1 +5-1 = t_1 +4.\n\ny_{t_1 +4} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1+1} + Δy_{t_1+2} + Δy_{t_1+3}  because y_{t_1+1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}\n\ny_{t_1+2} = y_{t_1+1} + Δy_{t_1+1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1+1}\n\n...\n\ny_{t_1+m} = y_{t_1} + sum_{k=0}^{m-1} Δy_{t_1+k}\n\nFor m=4, y_{t_1+4} = y_{t_1} + sum_{k=0}^{3} Δy_{t_1+k}\n\nAnd we want y_{t_1+4} =9, so 5 + sum_{k=0}^{3} Δy_{t_1+k} =9, thus sum_{k=0}^{3} Δy_{t_1+k} =4.\n\nSince each |Δy|<=1, we need exactly 4 up actions in the 4 actions a_{t_1} to a_{t_1+3}, so all U.\n\nThen y_{t_1+4} =5 +1+1+1+1=9.\n\nH=5, actions at t_1 to t_1+4, and y_{t_1+4} =9 at turn t_1+4.\n\nIn the sequence, actions for t=0 to H-1: a_{t_1} to a_{t_1+H-1}, with H=5, so a_{15} to a_{19}? t_1+ H-1 =15+5-1=19.\n\nBut y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{19} =9.\n\nThe actions are a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, so for H=5, actions at turn 15,16,17,18,19.\n\nBut at turn 19, we perform a_{19}, which sets y_{20}, but we don't care, since we already have y_{19}=9.\n\nIn this case, with all U: a_{15}=U, y_{16}=6\n\na_{16}=U, y_{17}=7\n\na_{17}=U, y_{18}=8\n\na_{18}=U, y_{19}=9\n\nThen at turn 19, we are at y=9, so we can stop, but the sequence includes a_{19}, which we can set to S or U, but since we reached, it doesn't matter, but to minimize H, we should not have extra actions.\n\nIn the minimal H, we should have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9 with the actions up to a_{t_1 + H -2} setting it, but the sequence includes a_{t_1 + H -1}, which might be redundant.\n\nFor example, with H=4: actions a_{15}, a_{16}, a_{17}, a_{18}\n\nThen y_{t_1 + H -1} = y_{15 +4 -1} = y_{18}\n\ny_{18} = y_{15} + Δy_{15} + Δy_{16} + Δy_{17}  because y_{16} = y_{15} + Δy_{15}, y_{17} = y_{16} + Δy_{16} = y_{15} + Δy_{15} + Δy_{16}, y_{18} = y_{17} + Δy_{17} = y_{15} + Δy_{15} + Δy_{16} + Δy_{17}\n\nSo y_{18} = 5 + sum of three Δy's from a15,a16,a17.\n\nWe need y_{18} =9, so 5 + sum_{k=15,16,17} Δy_k =9, sum of three Δy =4, but each <=1, impossible, since max sum=3.\n\nThus H=4 is impossible.\n\nMinimal H=5, with four U actions in the first four, but actions are a15 to a18 for H=4? With H=5, actions a15 to a19.\n\ny_{t1 + H -1} = y_{15+5-1} = y_{19}\n\nSet by y_{19} = y_{15} + Δy_{15} + Δy_{16} + Δy_{17} + Δy_{18} =5 + sum of four Δy from a15 to a18.\n\nSet to 9, so sum=4, thus all four U: a15=U, a16=U, a17=U, a18=U.\n\nThen y_{19} =9.\n\nAnd a19 is not needed, but in the sequence for H=5, we have to include a_{t1 + H-1} = a_{19}, which we can set to S, for example.\n\nSimilarly, in the collision check, at turn 19, we are on y=9, no cars, safe.\n\nBut let's confirm the turns.\n\nIn this case, from start:\n\nTurn 15: position y=5, no collision (as before). Action a15=U, so y_{16}=6.\n\nTurn 16: position y=6, check row 6 at turn 16 (t=1), safe. Action a16=U, y_{17}=7.\n\nTurn 17: position y=7, check row 7 at turn 17 (t=2), safe. Action a17=U, y_{18}=8.\n\nTurn 18: position y=8, check row 8 at turn 18 (t=3), safe. Action a18=U, y_{19}=9.\n\nNow turn 19: position y=9, reached, and since y=9, no freeway, no collision.\n\nBut for the sequence, with H=5, we need actions up to a_{19}.\n\nAt turn 19, we can choose a19, but since we are already at y=9, and we don't need to move, we can set a19=S, so y_{20}=9, but we don't care.\n\nTo have minimal H, H=5 with the above.\n\nBut earlier I thought H=4, but that was incorrect because of the indexing.\n\nIn my first thought, I had actions at 15,16,17,18 to reach at 19, which requires H=5 for the sequence.\n\nNow, back to collision: in this path, we are on rows 5,6,7,8 at turns 15 to 18, all of which have no collision, as established.\n\nRows 3 and 4 have collisions at certain times, but we never go there, so no issue.\n\nTherefore, with H=5, sequence: a15=U, a16=U, a17=U, a18=U, and a19=S (or U, but S is fine).\n\nBut since we reach at turn 19, and action at turn 19 can be anything, but to be precise.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to specify all actions from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nNow, is there a way with fewer actions? H=5 is minimal, since we need 4 up moves.\n\nIf we move faster, but we can only change by 1 per turn, so no, H=5 is minimal.\n\nBut what about rows 1-4? We don't need to go there, so no problem.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see if on row 5 at turn 15, is there any car? No, as before.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nPerhaps we can go down to avoid something, but since we need to go up, and no obstacles above, no need.\n\nIn this case, the direct up is fine.\n\nBut the problem is to avoid collisions, but since no collision possible on the path, it should be ok.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 3 and 4, but we are not on them.\n\nFor example, at turn 17, relative t=2, on row 3, there is a car that could cause collision, but we are on row 7, not row 3.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 5.\n\nSequence: actions at turn 15 to 19.\n\na15: U\n\na16: U\n\na17: U\n\na18: U\n\na19: S (since we are at y=9, stay)\n\nBut a19 can be S, or even U, but y=9, U would try to go to 10, but y=9 is max, so probably y stays 9 if U or S, but according to the dynamics, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y in [0,9], so if at y=9 and U, it should stay 9, I assume, since out of bound.\n\nSimilarly for D at 0.\n\nSo action U at y=9 is same as S.\n\nSo we can set a19=S.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nBut the turn numbers.\n\nt1=15, so:\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: S\n\nBut in the box.\n\nBut is H=5 minimal? Yes.\n\nPerhaps we can reach faster with different path, but no, since we need to cover 4 steps up.\n\nUnless we start moving earlier, but we start at turn 15.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 15, we are at y=5, and we can act immediately.\n\nIn the sequence above, we reach at turn 19.\n\nBut let me confirm if at any point there is collision.\n\nTurn 15: y=5, t=0, row 5 car: [13,24], 0 not in.\n\nTurn 16: y=6, t=1, row 6 car: [13+6=19, 24+6=30], 0 not in.\n\nTurn 17: y=7, t=2, row 7 car: [13+12=25,24+12=36], 0 not in.\n\nTurn 18: y=8, t=3, row 8 car: [13+18=31,24+18=42], 0 not in.\n\nTurn 19: y=9, no car, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut for freeway 3 and 4, at certain times, but we are not on them.\n\nFor example, at turn 17 (t=2), on row 3, second car span [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], so 0 in span, collision if on row 3 at turn 17.\n\nBut we are on row 7, not affected.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 5 with the sequence above.\n\nBut in the sequence, for turn 19, we set S, but since we reached, it's fine.\n\nPerhaps we can have H=4 if we can reach earlier, but as calculated, impossible because we need to increase y by 4, which takes at least 4 actions, so minimal H=5.\n\nAnother way: suppose we do nothing at first, but that would increase H, not decrease.\n\nOr move down, but that would require more up later, so worse.\n\nSo H=5 is minimal.\n\nThus, the sequence should be:\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: S\n\nBut in the action, for turn 19, since we are at y=9, and we need to specify action, S is fine.\n\nTo be precise.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nBut let me write it.\n\nSo, minimal H=5.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: S\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut the turn numbers: t1=15, so.\n\nIn the car states, for freeway 5,6,7,8, all have cars, but their spans never include 0, as min x is 13 or more.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 5) on turn 15 and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\n### Analysis of Car Spans and Collision Risks\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1)**: Car at (-60, -25, left, 36). The span at time \\(t\\) (relative to turn 15) is \\([-60 - 36t, -25 - 36t]\\). Since both endpoints are negative and decreasing, 0 is never in the span. No collision risk at any turn.\n- **Freeway 2 (y=2)**: Car at (-60, -25, left, 36). Same as above, no collision risk.\n- **Freeway 3 (y=3)**: Three cars:\n  - (24, 13, right, 6): Span at \\(t\\) is \\([13 + 6t, 24 + 6t]\\). Minimum is at least 13, so 0 never in span.\n  - (-12, -23, right, 6): Span at \\(t\\) is \\([-23 + 6t, -12 + 6t]\\). 0 is in span when \\(t = 2\\) (turn 17) and \\(t = 3\\) (turn 18).\n  - (-48, -59, right, 6): Span at \\(t\\) is \\([-59 + 6t, -48 + 6t]\\). 0 is in span when \\(t = 8\\) (turn 23) and \\(t = 9\\) (turn 24).\n- **Freeway 4 (y=4)**: Same cars as freeway 3, so collision risks at turns 17, 18, 23, and 24.\n- **Freeway 5 (y=5)**: Car at (24, 13, right, 6). Span at \\(t\\) is \\([13 + 6t, 24 + 6t]\\). Minimum is at least 13, so 0 never in span. No collision risk.\n- **Freeway 6 (y=6)**: Car at (24, 13, right, 6). Same as above, no collision risk.\n- **Freeway 7 (y=7)**: Car at (24, 13, right, 6). Same as above, no collision risk.\n- **Freeway 8 (y=8)**: Car at (24, 13, right, 6). Same as above, no collision risk.\n\nThe player must move from y=5 to y=9, requiring a net increase of 4 in y-coordinate. Since each \"U\" action increases y by 1 (and y is clamped to [0,9]), at least 4 \"U\" actions are needed. The minimal sequence length \\(H\\) to achieve \\(y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\\) is \\(H = 5\\), with actions at turns 15 to 19.\n\n### Collision-Free Path\n- **Turn 15**: Start at y=5. Row 5 car span at t=0: [13, 24], 0 not in span. Safe. Action: U → y=6 for turn 16.\n- **Turn 16**: Position y=6. Row 6 car span at t=1: [19, 30], 0 not in span. Safe. Action: U → y=7 for turn 17.\n- **Turn 17**: Position y=7. Row 7 car span at t=2: [25, 36], 0 not in span. Safe. Action: U → y=8 for turn 18.\n- **Turn 18**: Position y=8. Row 8 car span at t=3: [31, 42], 0 not in span. Safe. Action: U → y=9 for turn 19.\n- **Turn 19**: Position y=9. y=9 is not a freeway (no cars), so no collision. Goal reached. Action: S (stay, as y=9 is the target).\n\nThis sequence reaches (0,9) at turn 19 (\\(t_1 + H - 1 = 15 + 5 - 1 = 19\\)) with no collisions. \\(H = 5\\) is minimal, as fewer turns (e.g., \\(H=4\\)) cannot achieve a net increase of 4 in y-coordinate.\n\n### Answer\n\\boxed{\nTurn 15: U \\\\\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U \\\\\nTurn 19: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,6) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 16, and I'm at y=6.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. For left-moving cars, the span decreases over time because they're moving left, so the head and tail both decrease by s per turn. For right-moving cars, both increase by s per turn.\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, I'm on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. Also, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn, so I only care about the freeway I'm currently on for collision.\n\nI start at turn 16, position y=6. I need to reach y=9.\n\nThe actions are U (up, y increases by 1), D (down, y decreases by 1), or S (stay, y same). y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nSince I need to go up from 6 to 9, that's 3 steps up, so minimum H should be 3 if I can go straight up without hitting any cars. But I need to check if at any point, when I'm on y=6,7,8, there is a car that covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nThe collision is only for the freeway I'm on at that turn. So for each turn, depending on my y position, I need to ensure that for that freeway, no car has 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nThe cars are given for each freeway k, which I assume is y=k, since freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nLet me list the cars for each freeway at turn 16.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (48, 83, left, 36)\n\nSince it's left-moving, span at time T: [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)] but t_1 is 16, so for turn T, span is [48 - 36(T-16), 83 - 36(T-16)]? Head and tail.\n\nThe notation says for left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nAt t_1=16, for freeway 1, car is (48, 83, left, 36), so h=48, τ=83? But 48 to 83, since left-moving, head is left, I think? The span is given as (head, tail), but for left-moving, if it's moving left, the head should be the left end, I assume.\n\nIn the update: left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ], and h to τ, with h=48, τ=83, but 48 to 83 is increasing, but moving left? I think I need to interpret the coordinates.\n\nProbably x-coordinate, with left being smaller x, right larger x.\n\nSo for left-moving car, it's moving towards decreasing x.\n\nAt t_1=16, span is [h, τ] = [48, 83], which from 48 to 83, so if x increases to the right, then left end is 48, right end is 83, and moving left, so both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, span [τ, h]? Let's see the notation.\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor freeway 1: (48, 83, left, 36). Since direction left, head should be the front when moving left, so I think head is the left end.\n\nIn left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ] with h=48, τ=83, so [48,83], meaning from x=48 to x=83.\n\nMoving left, so at time T, span is [48 - 36(T-16), 83 - 36(T-16)]\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], for example freeway 3: (30,19,right,6), but (head, tail), so head=30, tail=19, direction right, so for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [19,30], I think, because it says [τ, h] for right-moving.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nFor right-moving car: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_t)]\"\n\nIn the car state, it's listed as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor freeway 3, one car is (30,19,right,6). So head=30, tail=19.\n\nSince direction right, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [19,30], so from x=19 to x=30, moving right.\n\nAt time T, span [19 + 6(T-16), 30 + 6(T-16)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, collision: at turn T, if I am on freeway y, then for that freeway, if there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn, I collide.\n\nSince I'm at x=0 always, I think, player position is (0,y_t), so x=0 fixed.\n\nSo I need that for the freeway I'm on at turn T, no car has min_span <= 0 <= max_span at that turn.\n\nAlso, when I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I decide action to go to y_{T+1}, but at turn T, I am on y_T, so I care about cars on y_T at turn T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}, care about cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nNow, I start at turn 16, y=6.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nMin turns: if I go U,U,U, that's three actions, to y=7 at turn 17, y=8 at turn 18, y=9 at turn 19. So at turn 19, I reach y=9, so H=3? Turns: from t=16 to t=19, actions at t=16,17,18, so H=3 turns.\n\nBut I need to check for collisions at each position.\n\nAt turn 16, I am on y=6. Freeway 6 has cars.\n\nFreeway 6: from table, freeway 6 has one car: (30,19,right,6)\n\nDirection right, so at t_1=16, span is [τ, h] = [19,30] for this car? Head=30, tail=19, direction right, so Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [19,30]\n\nYes.\n\nNow, at turn T, for freeway 6, car span is [19 + 6(T-16), 30 + 6(T-16)]\n\nAt turn 16, T=16, span [19,30], 0 is not between 19 and 30, so no collision at turn 16 on y=6.\n\nNow, if I go up, at turn 17, I will be on y=7, assuming I do U at turn 16.\n\nAction at turn t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, I am at y_t, I choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at turn 16, I am at y=6, I choose a_16, then y_17 = y_16 + Δy_16.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 17, I am at y_17, choose a_17, etc.\n\nTo reach y=9, let's say at turn H, I have y_H =9.\n\nSince I start at t=16 y=6, after k actions, at time t=16+k, y=6 + net up.\n\nEach U increases y by 1, D decreases, S same.\n\nI need to go from 6 to 9, so net +3, so min actions if no delays.\n\nBut may need to wait or something to avoid cars.\n\nNow, for turn 17, if I go to y=7.\n\nFreeway 7 has cars: from table, freeway 7: (30,19,right,6)\n\nSimilar to freeway 6.\n\nAt turn T, car on y=7: span [19 + 6(T-16), 30 + 6(T-16)] for this car.\n\nAt turn 17, T=17, span [19 + 6(1), 30 + 6(1)] = [25,36], 0 not in [25,36], so no collision.\n\nThen at turn 18, if I go to y=8.\n\nFreeway 8: (30,19,right,6), same as above.\n\nAt turn 18, T=18, span [19 + 6(2), 30 + 6(2)] = [19+12,30+12] = [31,42], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at turn 19, I go to y=9, but y=9 is not a freeway, freeways are y=1 to 8, so no cars on y=9, I assume. The collision is only for freeways y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe.\n\nThe problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1, ..., 8\" and \"reach (0,9)\", so at y=9, no freeway, no cars, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 might have no cars, but we start from y=6.\n\nSo in this case, if I go U at 16, U at 17, U at 18, then at turn 19, y=9, reached.\n\nAnd no collisions: at turn 16 on y=6, car span [19,30] not cover 0.\n\nTurn 17 on y=7, span [25,36] not cover 0.\n\nTurn 18 on y=8, span [31,42] not cover 0.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut is freeway 6 only one car? Freeway 6 has one car: (30,19,right,6), yes.\n\nSimilarly for 7 and 8.\n\nBut let's check freeway 3 and 4, they have multiple cars, but since I'm on y=6,7,8, I don't care about other freeways.\n\nIn this path, I only visit y=6,7,8.\n\ny=6 at turn 16, y=7 at turn 17, y=8 at turn 18, y=9 at turn 19.\n\nFor y=6,7,8, each has one car, all with same (30,19,right,6), so spans as above, all away from 0.\n\nBut at turn 16, on y=6, span [19,30], 0 not in.\n\nTurn 17, y=7, [25,36], not.\n\nTurn 18, y=8, [31,42], not.\n\nSo should be fine.\n\nBut the car on freeway 6, at turn 16, span [19,30], but 19 to 30, x=0 not in, yes.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nBut freeway 5,6,7,8 all have similar cars? Let's see the table.\n\nFreeway 1: (48,83,left,36)\n\nFreeway 2: (48,83,left,36)\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: (30,19,right,6), (-6,-17,right,6), (-42,-53,right,6)\n\nFreeway 4: same as 3: (30,19,right,6), (-6,-17,right,6), (-42,-53,right,6)\n\nFreeway 5: only one: (30,19,right,6)\n\nFreeway 6: only one: (30,19,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7: only one: (30,19,right,6)\n\nFreeway 8: only one: (30,19,right,6)\n\nFor freeway 3 and 4, there are three cars each.\n\nBut since I'm not on y=3 or 4, it doesn't matter for this path.\n\nIn my path, I'm only on y=6,7,8 at turns 16,17,18.\n\nFor y=6: at turn 16, car span [19,30] for the one car, not covering 0.\n\nSimilarly y=7 at turn 17: [25,36]\n\ny=8 at turn 18: [31,42]\n\nAll not covering 0.\n\nSo I can go straight up in three turns.\n\nBut is there any issue?\n\nThe player update: at turn t, I am at y_t, choose action, go to y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, I am on y_t, so I need to check collision for y_t at turn t.\n\nIn this case, all fine.\n\nPerhaps for some freeways, the cars might cover 0 at some turns.\n\nFor example, on freeway 1, car (48,83,left,36), left-moving.\n\nAt turn T, span [48 - 36(T-16), 83 - 36(T-16)]\n\nSet min <= 0 <= max.\n\nMin: 48 - 36(T-16) <= 0 and max: 83 - 36(T-16) >=0? For 0 to be in [min,max].\n\nSo min <= 0 <= max.\n\nmin = 48 - 36(T-16)\n\nmax = 83 - 36(T-16)\n\nmin <= 0: 48 - 36(T-16) <=0 => 48 <= 36(T-16) => T-16 >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so T-16 >= 2 since integer, T>=18\n\nmax >=0: 83 - 36(T-16) >=0 => 83 >= 36(T-16) => T-16 <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so T-16 <=2, T<=18\n\nmin <=0 and max >=0.\n\nmin <=0: 48 - 36Δ <=0, Δ = T-16, so 48 <= 36Δ, Δ >= 48/36 = 4/3, so Δ >= 2 since Δ integer? Δ = T-16, integer.\n\nT-16 >= ceil(4/3) = 2? 4/3=1.333, ceil is 2? No, ceil(1.333)=2? Ceil is smallest integer greater, so ceil(1.333)=2.\n\nBut Δ must be at least 2 for min <=0.\n\nmin <=0 when 48 -36Δ <=0, 36Δ >=48, Δ >= 48/36=4/3≈1.333, so since Δ integer, Δ >=2.\n\nmax >=0 when 83-36Δ >=0, 36Δ <=83, Δ <=83/36≈2.305, so Δ <=2.\n\nThus, min <=0 and max >=0 only when Δ=2, i.e., T=18.\n\nAt T=18, min=48-36*2=48-72=-24 <=0\n\nmax=83-72=11 >=0, so 0 in [-24,11], yes.\n\nAt T=17, min=48-36=12>0, max=83-36=47>0, so [12,47], 0 not in.\n\nT=16, [48,83], not.\n\nT=19, min=48-108=-60, max=83-108=-25, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo on freeway 1, collision only at T=18 if on y=1.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2, same car, same thing.\n\nBut I'm not on y=1.\n\nNow for freeway 3, multiple cars.\n\nFirst car: (30,19,right,6), right-moving, span at T: [τ + sΔ, h + sΔ] with τ=19? For this car, head=30, tail=19, direction right, so Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [19,30]\n\nThen Span(T) = [19 + 6Δ, 30 + 6Δ] with Δ=T-16\n\nNow, 0 in [19+6Δ, 30+6Δ] when min <=0<=max.\n\nmin=19+6Δ <=0? 19+6Δ <=0 only if Δ negative, but Δ>=0, min always positive, so never <=0, thus 0 not in span for this car, since min=19+6Δ >=19>0.\n\nSimilarly, max=30+6Δ>0, but min>0, so 0 not in [min,max] since min>0.\n\nSimilarly for other cars on freeway 3.\n\nSecond car: (-6,-17,right,6)\n\nHead=-6, tail=-17, direction right.\n\nSpan(t1) = [τ, h] = [-17, -6] since τ=tail? For right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h]\n\nτ is tail, h is head.\n\nIn this case, tail=-17, head=-6, so [τ, h] = [-17, -6]\n\nThen Span(T) = [τ + sΔ, h + sΔ] = [-17 + 6Δ, -6 + 6Δ]\n\n0 in this span if min <=0<=max.\n\nmin = -17 +6Δ <=0? -17+6Δ <=0 => 6Δ <=17 => Δ <=17/6≈2.833, so Δ<=2 since integer? Δ<=2.833, so Δ<=2.\n\nmax = -6 +6Δ >=0? -6+6Δ >=0 => 6Δ>=6 => Δ>=1\n\nAlso min <=0: -17+6Δ <=0 => 6Δ<=17 => Δ<=2.833, so Δ<=2\n\nmax >=0: -6+6Δ >=0 => Δ>=1\n\nSo 0 in span when Δ=1 or Δ=2.\n\nAt Δ=1, T=17, span [-17+6, -6+6] = [-11, 0]\n\n-11 <=0<=0, yes, 0 is included.\n\nAt Δ=2, T=18, span [-17+12, -6+12] = [-5,6], min=-5<=0, max=6>=0, so 0 in.\n\nAt Δ=0, T=16, span [-17,-6], min=-17<0, max=-6<0? max=-6<0, so 0 not in [-17,-6] since both negative.\n\nSimilarly, Δ=3, [-17+18, -6+18]=[1,12], min=1>0, 0 not in.\n\nSo for this car, collision at T=17 and T=18 if on freeway 3.\n\nThird car on freeway 3: (-42,-53,right,6)\n\nHead=-42, tail=-53, direction right.\n\nSpan(t1) = [τ, h] = [-53, -42]\n\nSpan(T) = [-53 +6Δ, -42 +6Δ]\n\nmin = -53+6Δ <=0? -53+6Δ <=0 => 6Δ<=53 => Δ<=53/6≈8.833, so always for small Δ? But we care about near future.\n\nmax = -42+6Δ >=0? -42+6Δ >=0 => 6Δ>=42 => Δ>=7\n\nmin <=0: -53+6Δ <=0 => 6Δ<=53 => Δ<=8.833\n\nmax >=0: -42+6Δ >=0 => Δ>=7\n\nSo 0 in span when Δ=7,8.\n\nAt T=16+7=23, Δ=7, span [-53+42, -42+42] = [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nT=24, Δ=8, [-53+48, -42+48]=[-5,6], 0 in.\n\nBut later, not relevant for min turns.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nBut back to my path: I'm on y=6,7,8, not on y=3, so no issue.\n\nIn my plan, at turn 18, I would be on y=8, which has a car: for freeway 8, car (30,19,right,6), span at T=18: [19+6*2,30+6*2]=[31,42], not covering 0.\n\nBut on freeway 3, at T=18, if I were there, it would be collision, but I'm not.\n\nSo for U,U,U sequence:\n\nTurn 16: at y=6, action U, go to y=7 next turn.\n\nAt turn 16, on y=6: car span [19,30] not cover 0, safe.\n\nTurn 17: now at y=7, action U, go to y=8.\n\nAt y=7: car (30,19,right,6), span at T=17: [19+6*1,30+6*1]=[25,36] not cover 0, safe.\n\nTurn 18: at y=8, action U, go to y=9.\n\nAt y=8: car span at T=18: [19+12,30+12]=[31,42] not cover 0, safe.\n\nThen at turn 19, y=9, reached.\n\nSo actions: Turn 16: U, Turn 17: U, Turn 18: U.\n\nH=3.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), so at turn 19, y=9.\n\nBut let's confirm if freeway 6 has only one car? Yes.\n\nIn the table, freeway 6: \"(30,19,right,6)\" only one.\n\nSimilarly for 7 and 8.\n\nBut freeway 3 and 4 have multiple, but not relevant.\n\nPerhaps for y=5, but I don't go there.\n\nAnother thing: at turn 18, on freeway 1, there is a collision, but I'm not on y=1.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut let's see the answer format, it should be minimal H.\n\nBut is there a reason I need more turns? For example, if at some point it was unsafe.\n\nBut in this case, seems safe.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that cars move, but since I'm moving up, and the cars on my path are moving away, it should be ok.\n\nMaybe for freeway 5, but I'm not on it.\n\nFreeway 5 has a car (30,19,right,6), same as others.\n\nBut at turn 16, if I were on y=5, span [19,30] not cover 0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut I start at y=6.\n\nPerhaps I should check if I can go faster, but min is 3 turns.\n\nOr maybe I can go in 2 turns? No, from y=6 to y=9, need at least 3 steps, since each U only +1, so min 3 actions.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with |Δy| <=1, so from 6 to 9, min 3 steps.\n\nSo H=3 should be achievable.\n\nBut let's double-check freeway 6 at turn 16.\n\nFreeway 6: car (30,19,right,6), span at T=16: since right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [19,30], yes [19,30], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps the multiple cars on other lanes, but not on my lane.\n\nAnother thing: the car on freeway 3 at T=17 and T=18 has collision, but y=3 not relevant.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut let's see the initial position: (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,6), and t_1=16.\n\nNow, the sequence: actions at t=16,17,18.\n\nSo in answer: Turn 16: U, Turn 17: U, Turn 18: U.\n\nThen at turn 19, y=9.\n\nBut the sequence is for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so H=3, actions at t=16,17,18.\n\nAnswer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nSo Turn 16: U, Turn 17: U, Turn 18: U.\n\nBut let's confirm if at any point I might be on a freeway where car covers 0.\n\nFor example, if I stay or something, but I'm not.\n\nPerhaps for y=8 at turn 18, but as above, safe.\n\nBut freeway 8 car at T=18: [19+12,30+12]=[31,42], 0 not in.\n\nBut earlier I thought about freeway 1 at T=18, but y=1 not my position.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nBut the problem says \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\", and I only care when I'm on those freeways.\n\nSo in this case, no issue.\n\nBut let's check freeway 4, for example, but not needed.\n\nPerhaps I should see if there is a car that might affect later, but since I'm done by turn 18, no.\n\nAt turn 18, I'm on y=8, action U to y=9, so at turn 18, I'm on y=8, which is freeway, but car not covering 0.\n\nThen at turn 19, I'm on y=9, not a freeway, no collision.\n\nSo done.\n\nBut the car state has freeway 3 and 4 with multiple cars, but again, not on those y.\n\nFor instance, on freeway 3 at T=17, car (-6,-17,right,6) has span [-11,0], which includes 0, so if I were on y=3 at T=17, collision, but I'm not.\n\nSimilarly, no issue.\n\nSo I think U,U,U is fine.\n\nBut perhaps for freeway 5 or something, but no.\n\nFreeway 5 has one car, same as 6,7,8.\n\nBut at turn 16, if I were on y=5, span [19,30], not cover 0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think minimal H=3 with three U actions.\n\nBut let's see if H can be less, but no.\n\nPerhaps I can reach faster by going down or something, but from 6 to 9, down would be worse, so up is direct.\n\nSo I think that's the answer.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", so H=3.\n\nBut in the sequence, it should be actions.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nSo \\boxed{ Turn 16: U \\\\ Turn 17: U \\\\ Turn 18: U }\n\nBut let's write it properly.\n\n\"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nt_1=16.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nAnd H=3.\n\nBut in the box.\n\nPerhaps I need to include that it reaches at turn 19, but the sequence is actions up to turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nSince y_{t_1 + H} =9 or something.\n\nLet's see.\n\nAt turn t_1, I am at y_{t_1}, after H actions, at time t_1 + H, I am at y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nThe actions are from t= t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn this case, t_1=16, H=3, actions at t=16,17,18, and at t=19, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nIf I start at t=16, after 0 actions, at t=16, y=6.\n\nAfter 1 action, at t=17, y=7 or etc.\n\nAfter 3 actions, at t=19, y=9.\n\nSo sequence of H actions.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nBut why do I feel like I missed something? Because the car states have multiple cars on some freeways, but for the freeways I use, only one car each, all moving away from 0.\n\nFor example, on freeway 6, the car is moving right, so at each turn, the span is shifting right, away from 0, so always safe for x=0.\n\nSimilarly for 7 and 8.\n\nWhereas on freeway 1 and 2, cars moving left, so they approach 0 and cover at T=18, but I'm not there.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nPerhaps for y=4 or something, but not in path.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 6) at turn \\(t_1 = 16\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- The player starts at \\(y = 6\\) at turn 16.\n- To reach \\(y = 9\\), a net increase of +3 in the y-coordinate is required.\n- The minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 3, achieved by moving up (U) in each turn: from \\(y = 6\\) to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 17, \\(y = 7\\) to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 18, and \\(y = 8\\) to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19.\n- Collision must be checked for each freeway \\(y\\) occupied at each turn \\(T\\):\n  - At turn 16, on freeway \\(y = 6\\):\n    - Car: \\((30, 19, \\text{right}, 6)\\)\n    - Span at \\(T = 16\\): \\([19 + 6(0), 30 + 6(0)] = [19, 30]\\) (since \\(\\Delta = T - 16 = 0\\))\n    - 0 not in \\([19, 30]\\), so no collision.\n  - At turn 17, on freeway \\(y = 7\\):\n    - Car: \\((30, 19, \\text{right}, 6)\\)\n    - Span at \\(T = 17\\): \\([19 + 6(1), 30 + 6(1)] = [25, 36]\\) (since \\(\\Delta = 1\\))\n    - 0 not in \\([25, 36]\\), so no collision.\n  - At turn 18, on freeway \\(y = 8\\):\n    - Car: \\((30, 19, \\text{right}, 6)\\)\n    - Span at \\(T = 18\\): \\([19 + 6(2), 30 + 6(2)] = [31, 42]\\) (since \\(\\Delta = 2\\))\n    - 0 not in \\([31, 42]\\), so no collision.\n- At turn 19, the player reaches \\(y = 9\\), which is not a freeway, so no collision check is needed.\n\nThe sequence of actions \\(U, U, U\\) achieves the goal in \\(H = 3\\) turns with no collisions.

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 17, and the player is at (0,7). The goal is to reach (0,9) in the minimal number of turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nThe player can move up (U: y increases by 1), down (D: y decreases by 1), or stay (S: y unchanged). Note that y is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at that turn, and there is a car on that freeway such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is within the car's span at turn T.\n\nImportant: when the player moves from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, at the moment of turn T, the player is still on y_T and will be on y_{T+1} only at the next turn. Therefore, at turn T, we only check the freeway y_T for collision.\n\nWe are given the state of cars at turn t1=17. For each car, we are given (head, tail, direction, speed). Note that for left-moving cars, the head is at a higher x than the tail? Actually, the update rule specifies:\n\n- Left-moving: at turn t1, span [h, τ] (which implies h >= τ). Then at turn T>t1, the span becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)].\n\n- Right-moving: at turn t1, span [τ, h] (which implies τ <= h). Then at T>t1, [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut note: the representation for the cars on freeways 3,4,5,6,7,8 has multiple cars. We must consider each car on each freeway.\n\nOur plan:\n1. We need to simulate the player's actions from turn 17 onward, and for each turn, we must check if the player would be in collision on the freeway they are currently on.\n\n2. The goal is to get to y=9. Note that at y=9, there is no freeway (freeways are from 1 to 8) so we are safe at y=9. Also, we start at y=7 and want to get to y=9. The minimal number of turns would be 2 if we can move up twice without collision. But we must check the cars on freeway 7 and 8 (since we are at y=7 at turn 17, then at turn 18 we would be at y=8, and then at turn 19 at y=9).\n\nHowever, we must check for collisions at each turn:\n\n- At turn 17: we are at y=7. We check freeway 7 for cars that have 0 in their span at turn 17.\n- At turn 18: we are at y=8 (if we moved up) and check freeway 8 for cars that have 0 in their span at turn 18.\n- Then at turn 19: we are at y=9 (safe).\n\nBut if at turn 17 we are at y=7 and there is a car on freeway 7 at turn 17 that covers x=0, then we must avoid. Similarly for turn 18 at y=8.\n\nLet's compute the car positions at turn 17 and then at future turns.\n\nFirst, note that the time difference is T - t1 = T - 17.\n\nWe are given the state at turn 17.\n\nFor freeway 7 and 8, we have:\n\nFreeway 7: one car: (36, 25, right, 6) -> but wait, the table says for freeway 7: (36,25,right,6). However, note that for right-moving cars, the span at turn 17 is [τ, h] = [25, 36]? Actually the representation is (head, tail, direction, speed). The problem says for right-moving: the span at t1 is [τ, h]. But the input gives (head, tail). We need to interpret: in the input, for a right-moving car, the head is the front? The update rule for right-moving: [τ, h] becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So at turn 17, the car is at [τ, h] meaning from τ to h. In the input, we have (head, tail). The head is the front? Then for a right-moving car, the head is the rightmost, so the span is [tail, head]. Therefore, the input (head, tail) for a right-moving car means: head = right end, tail = left end? Then the span is [tail, head].\n\nBut look at the update: for right-moving: [τ, h] -> [τ + s*dt, h + s*dt]. So τ is the left end and h the right end? Then the input (head, tail) for a right-moving car: head is the right end (h) and tail is the left end (τ). Similarly, for left-moving: [h, τ] -> [h - s*dt, τ - s*dt]. Then the input (head, tail) for left-moving: head is the left end? Actually, the problem says for left-moving: span [h, τ] and then moves left. So h is the leftmost? But wait: at t1, the car is at [h, τ]. Then as it moves left, both h and τ decrease. So the head (h) is the left end? But the problem says \"head\" and \"tail\". Typically, the head is the front. For a left-moving car, the front is the left end? Then yes: head is the left end, tail is the right end? But that would mean the car extends from h (left) to τ (right) and h <= τ? But the update rule writes [h, τ] and then h - s*dt and τ - s*dt. So if h is the left and τ the right, then as the car moves left, both decrease. However, in the input for freeway 1 and 2, we have (12,47,left,36). If h=12 and τ=47, then the car spans from 12 to 47? Then that is a long car. But then when moving left, at turn 17: [12,47]. Then at turn 18: [12-36, 47-36] = [-24, 11]. Then at turn 17, if the player is at x=0, then 0 is not in [12,47] -> safe? But wait, 0 is less than 12 so not in the span. So at turn 17, freeway 1 and 2 are safe.\n\nBut for freeway 7: we have a right-moving car: (36,25,right,6). For a right-moving car, the input is (head, tail) and the span at t1 is [tail, head] = [25,36]. Then at turn 17, the car is at [25,36]. The player is at x=0, which is not in [25,36] -> safe.\n\nBut we are at freeway 7 at turn 17? The player is at y=7, so we are on freeway 7 at turn 17. The car on freeway 7 at turn 17: [25,36] does not contain 0 -> safe.\n\nNow, if we move up at turn 17, then at turn 18 we will be at y=8. We then check freeway 8 at turn 18.\n\nFreeway 8: same as freeway 7? The table says for freeway 8: (36,25,right,6). So same as freeway 7? Then at turn 18, we need the car on freeway 8 at turn 18.\n\nFor freeway 8, the car is right-moving, so at turn 17: [25,36]. Then at turn 18 (dt=1): [25+6*1, 36+6*1] = [31,42]. 0 is not in [31,42] -> safe.\n\nThen we can move up again at turn 18 to y=9 at turn 19. Then we are done in 2 moves.\n\nBut wait, what about the other cars? Freeway 7 and 8 have only one car each? Actually, freeway 3 and 4 have multiple cars. But we are not on those freeways.\n\nHowever, let me check freeway 8 again: the table says for freeway 8: (36,25,right,6) — but that's one car? Actually, the table for freeway 3 and 4 has three cars. For freeway 5,6,7,8: only one car? The table:\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: (36,25,right,6), (0,-11,right,6), (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same.\n\nFreeway 5: only (36,25,right,6)\n\nFreeway 6: only (36,25,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7: only (36,25,right,6)\n\nFreeway 8: only (36,25,right,6)\n\nSo for freeway 8 at turn 17: one car: [25,36] (since right-moving: [tail, head] = [25,36]). Then at turn 18: [31,42] -> 0 not in there.\n\nBut what about freeway 7 at turn 17: [25,36] -> safe.\n\nSo the plan: \nTurn 17: U (to y=8 at turn 18)\nTurn 18: U (to y=9 at turn 19)\n\nBut wait, what about the player at turn 17: we are at y=7. Then after U, at the next state (turn 18) we are at y=8. Then at turn 18, we are on freeway 8 and check for collision at turn 18.\n\nHowever, we must also consider if we are forced to wait? But in this case, it seems safe.\n\nBut let me double-check the car on freeway 8: the car is (36,25,right,6). The span at turn 17: [25,36]. Then at turn 18: [25+6, 36+6] = [31,42] -> safe.\n\nBut what if we stay at turn 17? Then we remain at y=7 for turn 18? Then at turn 18, we are still at y=7 and we check freeway 7 at turn 18.\n\nFor freeway 7: the car is right-moving: at turn 17: [25,36]. At turn 18: [31,42]. 0 is not in [31,42] -> safe. Then we can move up at turn 18 to y=8 at turn 19, and then at turn 19 we are at y=8 and check freeway 8 at turn 19.\n\nAt turn 19, freeway 8: [25+6*(19-17)=25+12=37, 36+12=48] -> [37,48] -> safe. Then at turn 20 we move to y=9. That would take 3 moves. But we can do it in 2.\n\nSo the minimal H is 2.\n\nBut wait, what about the other freeways? We are only concerned with the freeway we are on at each turn.\n\nBut what if we move down? That would be away from the goal and take more steps, so not minimal.\n\nSo the minimal is 2.\n\nBut let me check the car on freeway 7: is there only one car? The table says freeway 7 has one car: (36,25,right,6). But wait, the representation for freeway 3 has three cars. Similarly, freeway 4 has three. But freeway 7 only one.\n\nBut what about freeway 8? Only one.\n\nHowever, I notice that freeway 3 and 4 have three cars. But we are not on those.\n\nBut wait, at turn 17, we are at y=7. Then if we move up at turn 17, we go to y=8 at turn 18. Then at turn 18, we are at y=8. Then we move up to y=9 at turn 19.\n\nBut is there any car on freeway 8 at turn 18? Only one car: [31,42] -> safe.\n\nBut wait, the table for freeway 8 only lists one car. So we are safe.\n\nBut let me check the initial state of freeway 8: the car is (36,25,right,6). For a right-moving car, the span at turn 17 is [tail, head] = [25,36]. So that's correct.\n\nBut what about the other freeways? For example, freeway 3: \nCars: \n1. (36,25,right,6) -> [25,36] at turn 17.\n2. (0,-11,right,6) -> [tail, head] = [-11,0] at turn 17? \n   Wait, the input is (head, tail) = (0, -11). For a right-moving car, the head is the right end? Then the span is [tail, head] = [-11, 0]. So at turn 17, this car covers from -11 to 0. Therefore, if the player were on freeway 3 at turn 17, then at x=0, it is in the span? But we are at y=7, not freeway 3.\n\nSimilarly, the third car: (-36,-47,right,6) -> span [-47,-36] at turn 17.\n\nSo freeway 3 at turn 17: \n- Car1: [25,36] -> doesn't cover 0.\n- Car2: [-11,0] -> covers 0? So if the player were on freeway 3 at turn 17, they would collide? But we are not.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 has the same cars.\n\nBut we are at freeway 7 and 8.\n\nHowever, what if we had to pass through freeway 6? We don't because we are starting at 7 and going to 8 and then 9.\n\nBut wait, what if we try to go down? That would be inefficient.\n\nBut is there any reason we cannot do two ups?\n\nAnother point: at turn 17, we are at y=7. Then we do U: at turn 18 we are at y=8. Then at turn 18, we check freeway 8: safe. Then at turn 18 we do U: at turn 19 we are at y=9.\n\nBut what about the car on freeway 7? We only care when we are on that freeway. At turn 17, we are on freeway 7: safe. Then we leave and never come back.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8: we are only on it at turn 18: safe.\n\nSo the sequence:\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\n\nBut wait, the answer format: \nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1+1: a_{t_1+1}\n\nHere t_1 = 17.\n\nSo:\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\n\nBut note: the sequence length is 2, so H=2? But the player at turn 17 (current) is at y=7. After first action (at turn 17) we move to y=8 at turn 18. Then at turn 18 we do the second action and move to y=9 at turn 19. So we reach at turn 19, which is after 2 actions (t=17 and t=18). The problem says: a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that at the end of H actions, we are at (0,9). So the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and after that action we are at (0,9). So at turn t1+H we are at (0,9). But the problem says: \"at turn t1+H-1\" we are at (0,9). Let me check:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd then: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nSo the last action is applied at turn t1+H-1, and then the position becomes y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nSo for H=2:\n- At turn 17 (t1+0): we apply a_17 -> then at the next state (turn 18) we are at y_18 = 7 + 1 = 8? \nBut then we need to apply the next action at turn 18 (t1+1) to get to 9 at turn 18? Wait, no.\n\nThe state is updated after the action. So:\n- At turn 17: we are at y17=7. We apply a17=U. Then the next state: turn 18, y18=8.\n- Then at turn 18: we apply a18=U. Then the next state: turn 19, y19=9.\n\nBut the problem says: after the sequence of H actions, at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. Here, after 2 actions, the last state update is at turn 19? But t1+H-1 = 17+2-1=18. But at turn 18 we are at y=8, not 9.\n\nI see the confusion.\n\nThe problem says: the sequence of actions is for turns from t1 to t1+H-1. And after applying these H actions, the position at turn t1+H-1 becomes 9.\n\nBut note: the position after the action at turn t is the position at turn t+1? Actually, the update: \ny_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nSo after applying a_t at turn t, we get y_{t+1}.\n\nTherefore, if we apply an action at turn t, the effect is seen at turn t+1.\n\nWe are starting at turn t1=17: we are at (0,7) at the beginning of turn 17. Then we choose an action for turn 17. After applying, we get y18.\n\nThen we choose an action for turn 18, and after applying we get y19.\n\nSo to have y19=9, we need two actions: a17 and a18.\n\nThen H=2, and the last action is at turn 18 = t1+1 = 17+2-1? t1+H-1 = 17+2-1=18. So at turn 18 (the last action) we are applying the action that leads to y19=9. But the problem says: at turn t1+H-1 (which is turn 18) we are at 9? But actually at turn 18 we are at y18=8, and we are applying the action that will set y19=9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nThis implies that at the state of turn t1+H-1, we are at 9. But in the update, the state at turn t is the state at the beginning of the turn? Then after the action at turn t, we get the state at turn t+1.\n\nSo the state at turn t is the position at the beginning of turn t. Then we apply action a_t, and then the state for turn t+1 is set.\n\nTherefore, we are given the state at turn t1 (17). We apply a17 and get state at turn 18. Then apply a18 and get state at turn 19.\n\nWe want the state at turn t1+H-1 to be (0,9). So if H=2, then we want at turn t1+1 (turn 18) to be at (0,9)? But that would require we get to 9 in one action? But we start at 7: one action only gets to 8.\n\nAlternatively, if H=3, then we want at turn t1+2 (turn 19) to be at 9.\n\nSo let me re-read the problem: \n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\" and \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\nSo the index: at turn t1+H-1, the y is 9.\n\nIn our update:\n- After 0 actions: turn t1: y_{t1} = 7.\n- After 1 action (applied at turn t1): we have y_{t1+1} at the next turn.\n- After H actions: we have y_{t1+H}.\n\nBut the problem says: after applying the sequence of H actions, the position at turn t1+H-1 is 9? That doesn't match because after H actions, the last state we set is y_{t1+H}.\n\nI think there is a misunderstanding.\n\nLooking at the problem: \n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nand then: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nBut note: the actions are applied at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. After applying the action at turn t1+H-1, the next state is y_{t1+H}. But the problem says y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nThis implies that the position at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 is 9? But then we don't need to apply an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the state update is such that the action at turn t determines the state at turn t? But the update rule says: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nSo the action at turn t determines the state at turn t+1.\n\nTherefore, if we apply an action at turn t, we are affecting the state at turn t+1.\n\nSo to have the state at turn T be 9, we need to have applied an action at turn T-1.\n\nWe are given the state at turn t1 (17). We want the state at turn T to be 9. Then T must be at least t1+? \n\nIf we do nothing, we stay at 7. But we need to get to 9.\n\nThe minimal T is t1+2: because at turn 17 we can apply U to get to 8 at turn 18, then at turn 18 we apply U to get to 9 at turn 19. So the state at turn 19 is 9.\n\nBut the problem requires that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. So if H is the number of turns (actions), then we require the state at turn (t1+H-1) to be 9.\n\nIn this case, we want the state at turn 19 to be 9. Then 19 = t1+H-1 = 17+H-1 => 17+H-1=19 => H=3.\n\nBut that would mean 3 actions? But we only need two actions: at turn 17 and 18.\n\nAlternatively, H is the number of actions, and we require after H actions, the state at turn t1+H is 9. But the problem says y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nI see the problem: the index of the turn when we are at 9 is t1+H-1. But in our update, after H actions, we are at turn t1+H.\n\nSo if we start at turn t1, after 0 actions we are at turn t1, after 1 action we are at turn t1+1, after H actions we are at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem requires that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. That would mean we are at 9 before the last action? \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me look at the answer format: it shows actions for turn t1, t1+1, ... up to t1+H-1.\n\nAnd then the position at turn t1+H-1 is 9.\n\nBut in the update, the position at turn t1+H-1 is determined by the action at turn t1+H-2.\n\nSo to have y_{t1+H-1}=9, we need to have applied actions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-2.\n\nThen the sequence of actions would be for t=t1 to t1+H-2, which is H-1 actions.\n\nBut the problem says the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, meaning H actions.\n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nPerhaps the problem means that we are at 9 at the turn after the last action. But then the last action is at turn t1+H-1, and then the state at turn t1+H is 9. But the problem says y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nAlternatively, the state is updated immediately at the same turn? But the update rule says y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nI think there might be a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nLet me read carefully: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\" and \"Collision occurs at turn T only if ... for any car on freeway y_T\".\n\nSo at turn T, the player is at y_T. Then we apply action a_T, and then the next state is y_{T+1} and we move to turn T+1.\n\nSo the player is at y_T at the beginning of turn T.\n\nWe apply action a_T, then we are at y_{T+1} at the beginning of turn T+1.\n\nThe goal is to be at y=9 at some turn. The problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" and specifically \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\nSo we require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, the player is at y=9.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t1, we are at y=7.\n\nWe apply actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., up to turn t1+H-2 to influence the state at turn t1+1, t1+2, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nTo have the state at turn t1+H-1 be 9, we need to have applied H-1 actions: from turn t1 to turn t1+H-2.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" which is H actions: from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nThen after applying these H actions, the last action is at turn t1+H-1, which will set the state at turn t1+H.\n\nBut we require the state at turn t1+H-1 to be 9, which would be set by the action at turn t1+H-2.\n\nSo the last action (at turn t1+H-1) is not needed for setting y_{t1+H-1}, but for setting y_{t1+H}. But we don't care about y_{t1+H} if we are already at 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nPerhaps the problem means that we stop when we are at 9, and we don't apply an action at the turn when we are at 9.\n\nSo the actions are applied only until we are at 9. The last action is applied at the turn when we are not yet at 9, and after that action we become at 9 at the next turn.\n\nSo the number of actions H is the number of moves we make. We start at turn t1 at y=7. We make H actions, and then after the last action, at the next turn we are at 9.\n\nSo the turn when we are at 9 is t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\nIt's conflicting.\n\nLet me try to reconcile with a small example.\n\nSuppose we are at y=8 at turn t1, and we want to get to 9. Then we can do one action U at turn t1, and then at turn t1+1 we are at 9. So H=1 action. Then the sequence is one action: a_{t1} = U. And we require y_{t1+1-1}=y_{t1}=9? But at turn t1 we are at 8, not 9.\n\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nIf we require y_{t1} to be 9, then we don't need any action. But that's not the case.\n\nPerhaps the problem means that after H actions, we are at 9 at the turn t1+H.\n\nBut then the problem should say y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nAnd the sequence is for turns t1 to t1+H-1, which is H actions, and then at turn t1+H we are at 9.\n\nAnd the minimal H such that we can be at 9 at turn t1+H.\n\nIn that case, for our example: \n- With 0 actions: at turn 17, we are at 7 (not 9).\n- With 1 action: at turn 18, we would be at 8 or 6 or 7.\n- With 2 actions: at turn 19, we can be at 9.\n\nSo H=2.\n\nAnd the sequence: \nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\n\nThen at turn 19, we are at 9.\n\nBut the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\", which would be y_{17+2-1}=y_18=8, not 9.\n\nSo it's likely a typo and they mean y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nOtherwise, if they require y_{t1+H-1}=9, then we would have to be at 9 at turn 18. How? If we start at 7, we cannot be at 9 in one action. We can only get to 8 at turn 18.\n\nSo the only way is if we are already at 9 at turn 17, but we are not.\n\nTherefore, I suspect the problem has a typo, and it should be y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nIn many path-finding problems, H is the number of moves and the state after H moves is at time t0+H.\n\nGiven the answer format, it lists actions for turn t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAnd then the final position is at turn t1+H.\n\nAnd they say \"minimal number of turns H\", but then the sequence has H actions, and the final state is at turn t1+H.\n\nSo perhaps \"turns\" here means the number of actions taken.\n\nWe'll assume that after H actions, the player is at (0,9) at turn t1+H.\n\nSo for our case, H=2, and the final state is at turn 19.\n\nNow, we must check for collisions during the journey.\n\nAt turn 17: we are at y=7. Check freeway 7 at turn 17.\n\nFreeway 7: one car: (36,25,right,6) -> span at turn 17: [25,36] (because for right-moving, [tail, head] = [25,36]). 0 not in [25,36] -> safe.\n\nAction: U -> then at turn 18, we will be at y=8.\n\nAt turn 18: we are at y=8. Check freeway 8 at turn 18.\n\nFreeway 8: car (36,25,right,6). At turn 18: dt=1, so new span: [25+6*1, 36+6*1] = [31,42]. 0 not in [31,42] -> safe.\n\nAction: U -> then at turn 19, we are at y=9, which is safe.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 2.\n\nThe actions are:\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\n\nBut what if there was a car on freeway 8 at turn 18 that covers 0? Then we would have to wait or move differently.\n\nFor example, if we had done:\nTurn 17: S (stay at y=7)\nThen at turn 18, we are still at y=7. Check freeway 7 at turn 18.\n\nFreeway 7 car at turn 18: [25+6, 36+6] = [31,42] -> safe.\nThen we can do U at turn 18 to go to y=8 at turn 19.\nThen at turn 19, we are at y=8, check freeway 8 at turn 19: [25+6*2, 36+6*2] = [37,48] -> safe.\nThen at turn 20, we can do U to go to y=9.\n\nBut that would be H=3.\n\nOr at turn 17: U to y=8 at turn 18. But if at turn 18 freeway 8 is not safe, then we might do D at turn 18 to go back to y=7 at turn 19, but that would be worse.\n\nBut in this case, it's safe.\n\nWhat about the other freeway cars? For example, freeway 6 has a car: (36,25,right,6). At turn 17: [25,36]. But we are not on freeway 6.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5, etc.\n\nBut is there a car on freeway 8 that might cover 0 at some turn? In this case, no.\n\nBut let me check the car on freeway 3 and 4, but we are not going there.\n\nOne more thing: the car on freeway 3 has a car that at turn 17 is at [-11,0]. That car is on freeway 3, and it is right-moving. At turn 18: [-11+6, 0+6] = [-5,6]. Then at turn 19: [1,12], etc. But we are at freeway 7 and 8, so no issue.\n\nSo the minimal is 2.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's check if we can do it in 2 moves without collision.\n\nTurn 17: \n- We are at y=7. \n- Freeway 7: cars: only one, [25,36] -> safe. \n- Action: U -> new y=8 at turn 18.\n\nTurn 18:\n- We are at y=8.\n- Freeway 8: cars: only one, [25+6*(18-17)=31, 36+6=42] -> [31,42] -> safe.\n- Action: U -> new y=9 at turn 19.\n\nSo done.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=2 actions.\n\nAnd the format is:\n\nTurn 17: a_{17}\nTurn 18: a_{18}\n\nSo we write:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\n}\n\nBut what if there is a car on freeway 7 at turn 17 that we missed? Let me check freeway 7 again.\n\nFreeway 7: only one car: (36,25,right,6). The span is [25,36] at turn 17. 0 is not in there.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 at turn 18: [31,42].\n\nBut wait, is there any other car on freeway 7 or 8? The table says only one for each.\n\nBut for freeway 4, there are three cars, but we are not on freeway 4.\n\nOne more point: the player is at x=0 always, and the cars are defined by their span on the x-axis.\n\nAlso, the collision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T (which is between 1 and 8) and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nFor freeway 7 at turn 17: we are on it, and 0 is not in any span -> safe.\n\nFor freeway 8 at turn 18: we are on it, and 0 is not in the span -> safe.\n\nSo we are good.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 7) at turn 17 in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1 to 8.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Initial Position (turn 17):** The player is at (0, 7). The target is (0, 9), which is 2 units above. Since moving up (U) increases y by 1, the minimal number of actions required is 2, provided the path is collision-free.\n- **Collision Check:**\n  - **At turn 17 (y = 7):** Check freeway 7 for collisions. The car on freeway 7 is given as (36, 25, right, 6). For a right-moving car, the span at turn 17 is [tail, head] = [25, 36]. The player's x-coordinate is 0, which is not in [25, 36]. Thus, no collision occurs. Action U can be taken, moving to y = 8 at turn 18.\n  - **At turn 18 (y = 8):** Check freeway 8 for collisions. The car on freeway 8 is (36, 25, right, 6). At turn 18 (T = 18, dt = T - 17 = 1), the span updates to [25 + 6*1, 36 + 6*1] = [31, 42]. The player's x-coordinate 0 is not in [31, 42]. Thus, no collision occurs. Action U can be taken, moving to y = 9 at turn 19.\n- **Final Position (turn 19):** After two actions (U at turn 17 and U at turn 18), the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 19. Since y = 9 is not a freeway (freeways are y = 1 to 8), no collision checks are needed at y = 9.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe minimal number of turns (actions) \\(H\\) is 2. The sequence of actions is:\n- Turn 17: U (move up to y = 8)\n- Turn 18: U (move up to y = 9)\n\nThis sequence avoids all collisions and reaches (0, 9) in the fewest turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 18, player is at (0,8). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nNote: Collision occurs at turn T only if at that turn the player is on a freeway k (which is y=k) and the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at turn T.\n\nImportant: The player updates position at the next turn. So at turn t, the player is at y_t and takes action a_t to move to y_{t+1}. The collision check is at the turn when the player is on the freeway. Specifically:\n\n- At turn T, if the player is on freeway k (i.e., y_T = k, which is between 1 and 8) and the car(s) on freeway k have a span that includes 0 at that exact turn T, then collision.\n\nBut note: if at turn T the player moves from y_T to y_{T+1} (so at turn T they are at y_T, and then they move to y_{T+1} at the next turn), then at turn T they are on freeway y_T. They are not on freeway y_{T+1} until turn T+1.\n\nOur goal: from y=8 at turn 18 to y=9 (which is the goal, and note y=9 is not a freeway so no cars to worry about) in minimal turns.\n\nHowever, we cannot pass through freeways 1 to 8 when there is a car at x=0 at that turn.\n\nWe are starting at y=8. The goal is to get to y=9. The only action that can get us to 9 is to move up (U) from 8. But we must check that at the turn we are on freeway 8 (which we are at turn 18) and when we move, we will be at 9 at the next turn.\n\nBut note: we are already at y=8 at turn 18. We are going to take actions starting at turn 18.\n\nWe need to reach (0,9). So we can consider:\n\nOption 1: Move up at turn 18: then at turn 19 we are at y=9. That would take 1 turn.\n\nBut we must check if at turn 18, when we are on freeway 8, is there a car on freeway 8 at x=0?\n\nGiven the car state for freeway 8: (42,31,right,6). But note: the representation is (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving, the car moves to the right. The initial span at turn 18 is [tau, h] for right? Actually, the representation says:\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t1) = [tau, h] -> at T, [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut in the table, for freeway 8: (42,31,right,6). This is a bit confusing because 42>31, but for a right-moving car, the head should be the front, which is the larger x? Actually, the representation says for right: [tau, h] meaning the tail is at tau and head at h? But then the span at t1 is [tau, h] and then moves by adding s*(T-t1) to both.\n\nBut in the given: (42,31,right,6). So if the head is 42 and tail is 31? That would be a car that is from 31 to 42? But then at t1 (turn 18) the span is [31,42]? But the representation says for right: [tau, h] so if they wrote (42,31) then is h=42 and tau=31? Then the span is [31,42] at turn 18.\n\nBut then at turn 18, the car on freeway 8 is at [31,42]. Does it include 0? 0 is not between 31 and 42 -> no collision at turn 18.\n\nSo if we move up at turn 18, then at turn 18 we are at y=8: no collision because the car on freeway 8 is at [31,42] (which doesn't include 0). Then at turn 19 we are at y=9 and we are done.\n\nBut wait, what about the next turns? We only need to get to (0,9) and we are done. So we don't need to worry about staying at 9.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 1, with action at turn 18: U.\n\nBut let me double-check the car update: at turn 18, the car on freeway 8 is at [31,42]. At turn 18, we are at y=8, so we check the car on freeway 8: 0 is not in [31,42] -> safe.\n\nThen we take U, so at turn 19 we are at y=9, and we stop.\n\nHowever, the problem says \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". At turn 19 we are at y=9, which is not a freeway, so no check needed.\n\nBut wait: the collision condition is only when we are on the freeway. So at turn 18 we are on freeway 8 and we checked: safe. Then at turn 19 we are at 9, which is safe.\n\nSo H=1, action: U at turn 18.\n\nBut why are there other freeways? We didn't use them because we started at 8 and only one move.\n\nBut let me check the car on freeway 8: is the representation correct? The table says for freeway 8: (42,31,right,6). The representation says for right: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" and then moves by adding s*(T-t1). So at T=18, the span is [31,42]? Then 0 is not in [31,42].\n\nBut note: the car might have been moving. The state is given at turn 18. So we don't need to compute the movement for the current turn because we are given the state at turn 18.\n\nSo the car on freeway 8 at turn 18 is at [31,42]. So 0 is not in that interval.\n\nTherefore, we can move up immediately.\n\nBut why are there multiple cars on some freeways? For example, freeway 3 has three cars. But we are only concerned with freeway 8 because we are at y=8 at turn 18.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nBut wait, the player is at (0,8) at turn 18. After action U, at turn 19 the player will be at (0,9). And we are done.\n\nBut let me check the next freeway? We are going to 9, so we don't step on any other freeway.\n\nBut what if we had to go through other freeways? In this case, we don't.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". Since we are only at freeway 8 at turn 18 and then leave, we are safe.\n\nBut wait: what if the car on freeway 8 at turn 18 is going to cover 0 at turn 19? But note the collision condition: it only checks at the turn when the player is on the freeway. At turn 19, the player is at y=9, so no check for freeway 8 at turn 19.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nBut let me verify the car update for freeway 8 at turn 18 and turn 19? Actually, we don't need for turn 19 because we are not on freeway 8 at turn 19.\n\nBut for completeness: at turn 19 (T=19, so T-t1=1), the car on freeway 8 would be: [31+6*1, 42+6*1] = [37,48] -> even farther from 0.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut what if we had to wait? Then we would have to check at turn 18 and then at turn 19 if we stay. But we are not staying.\n\nSo minimal H is 1.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions\". So H=1, and the sequence is one action: at turn 18: U.\n\nBut note: the sequence is from t=0 to H-1, so H=1 means we take one action at t=0 (which is turn 18) and then we are done.\n\nBut let me read the answer format: we have to write the actions for each turn starting from turn 18.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nBut wait, the player is at (0,8) at turn 18. After U, at turn 19 we are at (0,9). And we are done at turn 19. But the problem says \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1. So if H=1, then turn t1+H-1 = 18+1-1=18? That would be the same turn? That doesn't make sense.\n\nLet me check: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then we reach at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo if H=1, then we take one action at t=0 (which is turn 18) and then at turn t1+H-1 = 18+1-1=18, we are at the new position? But that would mean we are at (0,9) at turn 18? But we start at (0,8) at turn 18. How can we be at (0,9) at the same turn? That doesn't work.\n\nI think I misinterpreted the timing.\n\nLet me reexamine the update:\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, where Delta y_t depends on action a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t. We take action a_t, and then at turn t+1 we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nTherefore, if we start at turn t1 (18) at y=8, then:\n\n- If we take action at turn 18 (a_18), then at turn 19 we are at y_19 = y_18 + Delta y_18.\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at some turn. The problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo we require that at turn t1+H-1, the player is at (0,9).\n\nIf H=1, then we require at turn 18+1-1 = turn 18, we are at (0,9). But at turn 18 we start at (0,8). So we cannot be at (0,9) at turn 18 without taking an action? But the action we take at turn 18 will only affect the position at turn 19.\n\nTherefore, H must be at least 2? Because we start at turn 18 at (0,8), and the earliest we can be at (0,9) is turn 19.\n\nBut let me see the definition: the sequence of actions is from t=0 to H-1, meaning we take H actions starting at turn t1 (18) up to turn t1+H-1.\n\nThen the state after these actions is at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nThat seems inconsistent.\n\nLook: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nBut according to the update, after taking the first action a_{t1} (at turn t1), we are at turn t1+1 at position y_{t1+1}. Then after H actions, we are at turn t1+H at position y_{t1+H}.\n\nSo to have the position at turn t1+H-1 be (0,9), that would be after H-1 actions? Then we would take H-1 actions from t1 to t1+H-2, and then at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9).\n\nBut the problem says the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, which is H actions.\n\nI think there is a confusion.\n\nLet me parse:\n\nThe sequence of actions: t from 0 to H-1, so the actions are at turns: t1+0, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. That's H actions.\n\nThen after these actions, the player has moved H steps, and is at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nThis would imply that we are at (0,9) at the turn before the last action? Or is it a typo?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequence of actions is taken and then the position is updated so that at the turn after the last action, we are at the goal. But the problem explicitly says \"at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nLet me see the example: if H=1, then we take one action at turn t1 (18). Then the position at turn t1+H-1 = 18+1-1=18 is the position after the action? But the action taken at turn 18 only changes the position at turn 19.\n\nSo I suspect there might be a misunderstanding.\n\nAnother possibility: the turn index might include the starting turn. But the problem says \"current turn is t1\" and we are at (0, y_{t1}). Then we take actions starting at t1.\n\nThe goal is to be at (0,9) at some turn. The minimal number of turns H might be the number of turns from t1 until the goal turn, inclusive.\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence of actions for H turns (from t=0 to H-1).\n\nBut in the update, after k actions, we are at turn t1+k.\n\nSo to be at (0,9) at turn t1+k, we need k actions? Then H would be k+1? (including the starting turn) but the problem says \"turns\" and then the actions are for H turns.\n\nI think the problem means: we are going to simulate from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1, and at the end of this simulation (at turn t1+H-1) we are at (0,9). And we take actions at each turn from t1 to t1+H-2? But the action sequence is for t=0 to H-1, which is H actions, at turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nBut then after taking the last action at turn t1+H-1, the position at turn t1+H is updated. So to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, we must be there before the last action? That doesn't make sense.\n\nI think there is a mistake in the problem statement. Let me read carefully:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\"\n\nBut by the game dynamics, the position at turn t is determined by the actions up to turn t-1.\n\nSo to be at (0,9) at turn T, we must have taken an action at turn T-1 that moved us to y=9 at turn T.\n\nTherefore, if we want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, then we must have taken an action at turn t1+H-2 that moved us to 9.\n\nThe actions are from t1 to t1+H-1: which are turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nThe last action is at turn t1+H-1, which would affect the position at turn t1+H.\n\nSo to have the position at turn t1+H-1 be 9, we must have been moved there by the action at turn t1+H-2.\n\nTherefore, the actions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-2 are what matter for reaching 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut the action sequence includes one extra action at turn t1+H-1? That doesn't make sense.\n\nUnless H is the number of actions, and the goal is reached at turn t1+H.\n\nBecause after H actions, we are at turn t1+H.\n\nSo I suspect a typo in the problem: it should be \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H\".\n\nLet me check the problem again: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\".\n\nBut then if H=1, we want to be at turn t1, but we start at y=8, not 9.\n\nIf H=2, then we want to be at turn t1+1 = 19. That makes sense: we take one action at turn 18, and then at turn 19 we are at y=9.\n\nAnd the sequence of actions is for t=0 to H-1=1, so only one action: at turn 18.\n\nAnd H=2 turns: meaning from turn 18 to turn 19, so two turns, but we only take one action.\n\nThe problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". If H is the number of turns from the start until the goal, inclusive, then from turn 18 to turn 19 is two turns: turn 18 and turn 19.\n\nBut then we only take one action.\n\nIn the answer format, we list the actions for the turns we take actions.\n\nSo for this case: H=2, and we take one action at turn 18.\n\nThen the answer would be:\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nAnd that's it? But the sequence is for t=0 to H-1=1, so t=0: turn 18.\n\nThen we don't have an action for turn 19 because we are done.\n\nSo the minimal H is 2, and the action is at turn 18: U.\n\nBut why does the problem say \"sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and H=2, so t=0 and t=1? But we only have one action.\n\nNo: H=2, then t from 0 to 1? That would be two actions.\n\nThat doesn't match.\n\nUnless H is the number of actions.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", not actions.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAnother way: perhaps \"turns\" here means the number of game turns that pass, including the starting turn.\n\nSo from turn 18 (start) to turn 18+H-1 (goal).\n\nAnd we are at (0,9) at turn 18+H-1.\n\nWe start at turn 18 at (0,8). We want to be at (0,9) at turn T = 18+H-1.\n\nThe number of turns that pass is H, which includes turn 18, 18+1, ..., 18+H-1.\n\nSo for example, if we are at (0,9) at turn 19, then T=19, so 18+H-1=19 -> H=2.\n\nThe number of turns is 2: turn 18 and turn 19.\n\nThe actions are taken at turns 18, 19, ..., 18+H-2? Because to move at turn 18, we affect turn 19; to move at turn 19, we affect turn 20, etc.\n\nTo be at (0,9) at turn T=18+H-1, we must have taken an action at turn T-1 = 18+H-2.\n\nThe actions are taken at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2.\n\nBut the problem says the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, which is H actions.\n\nSo if H=2, then we need two actions? But we only need one action to move from 8 to 9.\n\nThis is not matching.\n\nI think the only logical way is that the goal is at turn t1+H, after H actions.\n\nAnd the problem likely has a typo.\n\nGiven that, in many such problems, after k actions, you are at turn t1+k.\n\nAnd you want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H.\n\nThen the minimal H such that we can be at (0,9) at turn t1+H.\n\nIn this case, with one action (H=1), we can be at (0,9) at turn 19.\n\nSo H=1 for the number of actions, but the problem asks for \"turns\".\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the actions for H turns.\n\nPerhaps H is the number of turns from the start until and including the goal turn.\n\nSo if we start at turn 18 and reach at turn 19, then H=2 (turns 18 and 19).\n\nThen the number of actions is H-1.\n\nIn the action sequence, we have actions for the turns we are allowed to act: turns 18,19,..., up to the turn before we reach.\n\nSo for H=2, we have actions at turns 18 and 19? But we only need to act at turn 18.\n\nBut the sequence is for t=0 to H-1, which for H=2, would be two actions.\n\nBut we only need one.\n\nSo for the turn we reach, we don't take an action.\n\nTherefore, the action sequence should be for the turns from t1 to t1+H-2, so that after the last action at turn t1+H-2, we are at turn t1+H-1 at the goal.\n\nThen the number of actions is H-1.\n\nAnd the sequence is indexed from t=0 to H-2, which is H-1 actions.\n\nBut the problem says from t=0 to H-1.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nGiven the confusion, let me assume that the intended meaning is: we are to be at (0,9) at turn t1 + H, after taking H actions (at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1).\n\nBecause that is the standard in many games.\n\nThen for our case, with H=1, we take action at turn 18: U, and at turn 19 we are at (0,9).\n\nAnd H=1.\n\nBut the problem says \"turns\", not \"actions\".\n\nBut in the answer format, we are to list the actions for each turn from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nSo for H=1, only turn 18.\n\nAnd we reach at turn 19.\n\nBut the problem says \"at turn t1+H-1\", which would be turn 18 for H=1, but we are at 8 at turn 18.\n\nSo it must be at turn t1+H.\n\nI think it's a typo, and it should be t1+H.\n\nGiven that, and that with one action we can do it, and it's safe, then we should do that.\n\nBut to be safe, let's check if we can wait? But we don't need to wait.\n\nBut what if at turn 18 on freeway 8 it is safe, but at turn 19 if we were to be on freeway 8 it would be safe too, but we are leaving.\n\nSo there's no issue.\n\nPerhaps the problem requires that we don't collide during the entire sequence, but at the goal we are at 9, so no issue.\n\nSo I think H=1 action, and we move up at turn 18.\n\nBut then the minimal number of turns (as in game turns) that pass is 1 action turn, and then the next turn we are there, so 2 turns total.\n\nBut the problem asks for H, the minimal number of turns, which might be the number of turns from start to finish inclusive.\n\nIn that case, from turn 18 to turn 19 is 2 turns.\n\nAnd then the action sequence would be for the turns we act: only turn 18.\n\nBut the sequence is for t=0 to H-1. If H=2, then t=0 and t=1. So two actions.\n\nThen what is the second action? We don't need it.\n\nWe can put S (stay) at turn 19, but then we would be at y=9 at turn 20, and H would be 3 turns (18,19,20), which is worse.\n\nOr after moving to 9 at turn 19, we don't need to do anything, but the sequence must have H actions.\n\nThis is problematic.\n\nPerhaps for the turn we reach, we don't take an action, but the problem says the sequence is from t=0 to H-1, for H turns.\n\nAnother idea: \"turns\" in H might refer to the number of actions, i.e., the number of turns we take actions.\n\nThen H=1, and we have one action.\n\nAnd the goal is at turn t1+H = 18+1=19.\n\nAnd the problem should have said \"at turn t1+H\".\n\nGiven that the car update rules use \"at turn T\", and the player position at turn T is after actions up to T-1, it makes sense to have the goal at turn t1+H.\n\nI think that's the case.\n\nSo I will assume that the goal is to be at (0,9) at turn 18+H.\n\nThen with H=1, at turn 19.\n\nAnd the action is at turn 18: U.\n\nAnd we have to output only that action.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 18: U\n}\n\nBut to be thorough, let's check if there is any reason we cannot do that.\n\nFreeway 8 at turn 18: car is at [31,42] for freeway 8? For right-moving car: given as (head, tail) = (42,31), and for right-moving, the span is [tau, h] = [31,42] at turn 18. 0 is not in [31,42], so safe.\n\nThen we move to y=9 at turn 19.\n\nAt turn 19, we are not on any freeway (since y=9 is not a freeway), so no collision check.\n\nTherefore, it is safe.\n\nBut what about the other freeways? We never step on them, so no need to check.\n\nSo it should be safe.\n\nBut let me look at the other freeways out of curiosity. For example, freeway 7: also has a car (42,31,right,6) -> [31,42] at turn 18, safe. Similarly for 5,6.\n\nFreeway 3 and 4 have multiple cars: for example, freeway 3: three cars: (42,31,right,6), (6,-5,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6). At turn 18, the spans are:\n\n- Car1: [31,42]\n- Car2: [-5,6] -> wait, tail is -5, head is 6? So span for right-moving is [tau, h] = [-5,6]. Does it include 0? -5<=0<=6 -> yes! So at turn 18, freeway 3 has a car at [-5,6] which includes 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 has the same cars, so also has a car covering 0 at turn 18.\n\nBut we are at y=8 at turn 18, not on y=3 or y=4, so no collision.\n\nIf we were to move to y=7 or something, we would have to check, but we are not.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 1 (action), and the action is U at turn 18.\n\nBut to match the problem's \"turns\", if they mean the number of game turns including start and finish, then we need to set H=2, and then the action sequence would be for two turns, but we only need to act on the first.\n\nBut the problem says \"sequence of actions\", and if H=2, we need two actions.\n\nThen what should the second action be? We are at y=9 at turn 19, and we can do S (stay) at turn 19, but then we are still at 9 at turn 20, and we reach at turn 20, which is later.\n\nBut the minimal H in terms of game turns should be 2 turns (from turn 18 to turn 19), but then we only have one action.\n\nThis is a problem in the problem statement.\n\nPerhaps the action sequence is only for the turns we are not at the goal, but the problem specifies the length.\n\nGiven the answer format, and that the minimal number of actions is 1, and the minimal number of game turns from start to finish is 2, but the problem likely means the number of actions is H.\n\nBecause it says \"minimal number of turns H\", but in the context, \"turns\" might mean actions.\n\nIn many games, a \"turn\" is an action opportunity.\n\nSo I think H=1.\n\nAnd the sequence is one action.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n\nIf the problem intended H to be the number of game turns including start, then for H=2, we need to have two actions, but we only need one, so we can put a dummy action at turn 19, but that increases H to 2 actions, which is worse.\n\nOr if we do nothing at turn 18, then at turn 19 we are still at 8, and then we move at turn 19 to 9, reaching at turn 20, which is H=3 game turns.\n\nSo that's not minimal.\n\nTherefore, the only minimal way is to move at turn 18 with U, and then we are done with one action.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 18: U\n}\n\nTo be safe, let's check if there is any constraint that we cannot move up from 8? The player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y, with Delta y = +1 for U, and y_{t+1} in [0,9]. 8+1=9, which is valid.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 8) at turn 18. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1 to 8.\n\n### Analysis:\n- The only action required to reach y = 9 from y = 8 is to move up (U) at turn 18. This will update the player's position to (0, 9) at turn 19.\n- Collision is checked only when the player is on a freeway (y = 1 to 8) at a given turn. At turn 18, the player is on freeway y = 8.\n- For freeway 8 at turn 18, the car state is given as (42, 31, right, 6). For a right-moving car, the span at turn 18 is [tail, head] = [31, 42]. Since 0 is not in the interval [31, 42], no collision occurs at turn 18.\n- After moving to y = 9 at turn 19, the player is no longer on any freeway (y = 9 is not a freeway), so no collision check is needed at turn 19 or beyond.\n\n### Minimal Turns:\n- The sequence involves one action (H = 1) to reach the goal at turn 19 (i.e., turn \\( t_1 + H = 18 + 1 = 19 \\)).\n- The minimal number of turns \\( H \\) for the action sequence is 1, as only one action is required.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- At turn 18, the action is U (move up).\n\n### Verification for Other Freeways:\n- The player only occupies freeway 8 at turn 18 and does not occupy any other freeways during the sequence. Therefore, cars on other freeways (y = 1 to 7) do not affect the player, as collision is only checked when the player is on the freeway at the exact turn.\n\nThus, the minimal sequence is a single action at turn 18.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 18: U\n}",
