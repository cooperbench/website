        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves up, down, or stays each turn, changing y by +1, -1, or 0. Collisions happen only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y where a car's span includes 0 at that turn.\n\nThe car spans move left or right based on their direction and speed. For left-moving cars, the span decreases by s per turn, and for right-moving, it increases by s per turn.\n\nThe current turn is t_1, but it says t_0 = 0, so I think t_1 is 0. Let me check.\n\n\"Current Turn: t_0 = 0\" and \"Player Position: (0,0)\", so t_1 = 0. I'll use t starting from 0.\n\nSo at turn t, player position is (0, y_t), with y_0 = 0.\n\nI need to reach y = 9 as soon as possible.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to y=8, each with cars described.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at each turn relative to x=0, since collision is when 0 is in their span at the turn when the player is on that row.\n\nSince the player moves after the car positions are updated? Let's see the update.\n\nAt turn T, for collision, it depends on the car positions at that turn T.\n\nAnd when the player moves, at turn T, they decide action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}. But for collision, it's based on y_T at turn T.\n\nThe collision condition says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the row at turn T.\n\nAlso, note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\", meaning that at turn T, you are still on y_T for collision purposes, and you move to y_{T+1} at the next turn.\n\nSo, to avoid collision, for each turn T, if the player is on freeway k (y_T = k), then for that k, no car should have 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nIf y_T is not between 1 and 8, no collision possible, since no cars on y=0 or y=9. y=0 and y=9 are safe, I assume, as there are no freeways there. Freeways are only y=1 to y=8.\n\ny=0 is start, y=9 is goal, no cars, so safe.\n\nNow, I need to find a sequence of actions to go from y=0 to y=9 in min turns, avoiding being on a freeway row when a car is at x=0.\n\nSince we start at y=0 at turn 0, and end at y=9 at some turn H, with y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9? Let's see the sequence.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so actions from turn t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, and after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position is y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nBut we want to reach (0,9), so y_{t_1 + H} should be 9? Let's see.\n\nThe player update: at turn t, after action a_t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo at turn t, position is (0, y_t).\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} is new position for turn t+1.\n\nTo be at (0,9) at some turn, say turn T, y_T = 9.\n\nAnd we start at turn 0, y_0 = 0.\n\nWe need min H such that after H turns, we are at y_H = 9? Let's see the sequence index.\n\nThe actions are from t=0 to H-1, so after H actions, from turn 0 to turn H.\n\nAt turn 0: y_0\n\nAction a_0: y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\n...\n\nAt turn t: y_t\n\nAction a_t: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\n\nAt turn H: y_H\n\nWe want y_H = 9 for some H.\n\nThe minimal H such that y_H = 9.\n\nSince we start at y=0, and need to go to y=9, the minimum possible H is 9, if we go up every turn: y1=1, y2=2, ..., y9=9.\n\nBut we might hit cars, so we might need to wait or detour.\n\nBut detour might take more turns, so min H is at least 9, but could be more if we need to avoid.\n\nSince we can only change by -1,0,+1, to go from 0 to 9, we need at least 9 up moves, and possibly some down or stay, which would increase H.\n\nSo H >= 9, and min H is 9 only if we can go straight up without collision.\n\nOtherwise, we need more.\n\nFirst, let's list the car positions over time for each freeway.\n\nCurrent turn t=0.\n\nFor each car, given (head, tail, direction, speed) at t=0.\n\nSpan at t=0 is given.\n\nThen at time T, span is updated.\n\nFor left-moving: span(T) = [h - s*T, τ - s*T] since t_1=0, T>t_1, T from 0?\n\nAt turn T, span is relative to T.\n\nFor car, at turn T, position based on initial at t=0.\n\nFor left-moving car: at turn T, head position is h - s*T, tail is τ - s*T.\n\nSince direction left, head is larger x? Let's see.\n\nIn the description, for left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ], with h and τ, and h > τ I assume, since left-moving, head at larger x.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving, [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor left-moving, head and tail, with head > tail? Not specified.\n\nLook at the values.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (48, 83, left, 36)\n\n48 and 83, left direction.\n\nIf left-moving, and span [h, τ], if moving left, head should be on the right, so larger x, tail left smaller x? No.\n\nTypically, for a car moving left, the front is at smaller x, back at larger x? I'm confused.\n\nLet's think coordinates.\n\nAssume x-axis, 0 is the point we need to cross.\n\nCars are on horizontal freeways, moving left or right.\n\nFor a car, the span is the segment it occupies.\n\nFor left-moving car: as it moves left, x decreases.\n\nSo at time t, the position: let's say the head is the front, which for left-moving is the left end? Or right end?\n\nIn the span definition:\n\nFor left-moving: span(t1) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSo if [h, τ] at t1, and h - sΔT, τ - sΔT, so both decrease, so if h > τ, then it's moving left, head at h, tail at τ, with h > τ, so head is right, tail left? But when moving left, front should be left.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nPerhaps the span is given with min and max.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 1: (48, 83, left, 36)\n\n48 and 83, if left-moving, and [48,83], then at T, [48 -36T, 83-36T], so at T=0, [48,83], which is from x=48 to x=83, so if moving left, the car is facing left, so left end is front, I think.\n\nBut 48 to 83, 48<83, so left end 48, right end 83, moving left, so front at 48, back at 83.\n\nThen at time T, front at 48-36T, back at 83-36T.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], so if [τ,h] with τ < h, then at T, [τ + sT, h+sT], so front at h, back at τ, moving right.\n\nIn the car state for freeway 3: (48,37, right,12) but it says (head, tail, direction, speed), and for right-moving, it should be [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nHere (48,37, right,12), 48>37, but if right-moving, [τ,h] should have τ < h, but 48>37, so τ=37, h=48? But it's listed as (48,37), which is head=48, tail=37? But for right-moving, head should be larger, tail smaller.\n\nLet's see the list:\n\nFor freeway 3: (48,37, right,12), (12,1, right,12), (-24,-35, right,12)\n\nFor (48,37, right,12): if right-moving, span should be [τ, h] with τ < h, so τ=37, h=48? But it's written as (head=48, tail=37), so head is the front.\n\nSimilarly, (12,1, right,12), head=12, tail=1, so front at 12, back at 1.\n\nFor right-moving, front at larger x, back at smaller x.\n\nSimilarly, left-moving, for freeway 1: (48,83, left,36), head=48, tail=83, so if left-moving, front at smaller x, back at larger x, so at x=48 (front) to x=83 (back).\n\nAt T=0, span [48,83] for left-moving.\n\nThen at turn T, for collision, we care when 0 is in the span for that freeway.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAlso, for a freeway, there might be multiple cars.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when it is safe to be on that row, i.e., when no car has 0 in its span.\n\nSince the player is at discrete turns, we need for each turn T, if y_T = k, then for freeway k, at turn T, 0 not in any car's span.\n\nSo let's find for each freeway k, the set of turns T where it is unsafe, i.e., some car has 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nThen for the path, we need that for each T, if y_T = k between 1 and 8, T not in unsafe set for k.\n\ny_T can be 0 or 9, safe.\n\nStart at T=0, y=0, safe.\n\nEnd at T=H, y=9, safe.\n\nWe need min H, so we want to reach y=9 as soon as possible, so we should go up as much as possible, but avoid unsafe times on each row.\n\nSince we can stay or go down, but that might delay, so we need to find a sequence with min up moves and no unnecessary delays.\n\nBut since we must go from 0 to 9, we need exactly 9 net up moves, but with possible down or stay, total turns H >=9.\n\nMin H is 9 if possible.\n\nFirst, let's list all freeways and their cars.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head=48, tail=83, left, speed=36)\n\nAt turn T, span: [48 - 36T, 83 - 36T]\n\n0 in span if 48 -36T <= 0 <= 83 -36T? Since left-moving, span [front, back] = [48-36T, 83-36T], and since 48-36T <= 83-36T, so 0 in span if 48-36T <= 0 <= 83-36T.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo for freeway 1:\n\nUnsafe if 48-36T <= 0 and 0 <= 83-36T\n\nWhich is 48-36T <= 0 => 36T >=48 => T >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so T>=2 since T integer? T turn, integer.\n\nT >= ceil(48/36) = ceil(4/3) = 2? 48/36=4/3≈1.333, so T >= 2 for the left inequality? Let's solve.\n\n48-36T <= 0 => 36T >=48 => T >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, since T integer, T >= 2.\n\nAnd 0 <= 83-36T => 83-36T >=0 => 36T <=83 => T <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so T <=2 since T integer.\n\nT <= floor(83/36) = floor(2.305) =2\n\nAnd T >= ceil(48/36) = ceil(1.333) =2\n\nSo only at T=2, both conditions: T>=2 and T<=2, so unsafe only at T=2.\n\nT=2: 48-72 = -24 <=0, 83-72=11 >=0, so 0 between -24 and 11, yes, 0 in span.\n\nT=1: 48-36=12, 83-36=47, 12<=0<=47? 0<12, false, 0 not >=12, so not in span.\n\nT=3: 48-108=-60, 83-108=-25, -60 <=0<= -25? 0 <= -25 false, so not.\n\nSo only unsafe at T=2 for freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, (48,83,left,36), so same, unsafe only at T=2.\n\nNow freeway 3: multiple cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12)  head=48, tail=37, right direction.\n\nFor right-moving, span at T: [τ + sT, h + sT] = [37 + 12T, 48 + 12T] since τ=tail=37, h=head=48.\n\nIn general, for right-moving, span [τ + sT, h + sT] with τ < h.\n\nHere τ=37, h=48.\n\nAt T, [37+12T, 48+12T]\n\n0 in span if 37+12T <= 0 <= 48+12T? But 37+12T <= 48+12T always, and 0 in if min <=0<=max, so if 37+12T <= 0 and 0 <= 48+12T.\n\nBut 37+12T <=0 => 12T <= -37, impossible since T>=0, 12T>=0, so never true. So 0 never in span for this car, because at T=0, [37,48] both positive, and increasing, so always positive, never reach 0.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12,1,right,12), head=12, tail=1, so [1 +12T, 12+12T], at T=0 [1,12], all positive, increasing, 0 never in span.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,12), head=-24, tail=-35? head and tail.\n\ntail=-35, head=-24, so [τ + sT, h + sT] = [-35 +12T, -24 +12T]\n\n0 in span if -35+12T <= 0 <= -24+12T\n\nFirst, -35+12T <=0 => 12T <=35 => T <= 35/12 ≈2.916, so T<=2\n\nSecond, 0 <= -24+12T => 12T >=24 => T>=2\n\nSo T>=2 and T<=2, so at T=2: -35+24= -11 <=0, -24+24=0 <=0? 0 <=0 true, so 0 in span at T=2.\n\n-11 <=0<=0, yes.\n\nT=1: -35+12= -23 <=0, 0 <= -24+12= -12? 0 <= -12 false.\n\nT=3: -35+36=1 <=0 false.\n\nSo only at T=2 for this car.\n\nBut freeway 3 has multiple cars, so unsafe if any car has 0 in span.\n\nFirst two cars never have 0, third has at T=2.\n\nSo freeway 3 unsafe only at T=2.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same cars as freeway 3, so unsafe only at T=2.\n\n(48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12), same as freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 5: same as 3 and 4, unsafe at T=2.\n\nNow freeway 6: one car (48,37,right,6)\n\nhead=48, tail=37, right, speed=6.\n\n[τ + sT, h + sT] = [37 +6T, 48+6T]\n\n0 in span? 37+6T <=0 <=48+6T\n\nBut 37+6T <=0 impossible for T>=0, so never unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: (48,37,right,6), same, never unsafe.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,6), same as above, never unsafe.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,6), head=0, tail=-11, right direction.\n\n[τ + sT, h + sT] = [-11 +6T, 0 +6T] = [-11+6T, 6T]\n\n0 in span if -11+6T <= 0 <= 6T\n\nFirst, -11+6T <=0 => 6T <=11 => T <= 11/6 ≈1.833, so T<=1\n\nSecond, 0 <= 6T => T >=0\n\nSo for T=0 and T=1.\n\nT=0: -11 <=0 <=0? 0<=0 true, so yes.\n\nT=1: -11+6= -5 <=0, 0 <=6 true, so yes.\n\nT=2: -11+12=1 <=0 false, so not.\n\nSo at T=0 and T=1, unsafe for this car.\n\nFirst car on freeway 8 never unsafe, so freeway 8 unsafe at T=0 and T=1 due to second car.\n\nNow summarize for each freeway, unsafe turns:\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe at T=2\n\nFreeway 2: unsafe at T=2\n\nFreeway 3: unsafe at T=2\n\nFreeway 4: unsafe at T=2\n\nFreeway 5: unsafe at T=2\n\nFreeway 6: always safe (no car has 0)\n\nFreeway 7: always safe\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at T=0 and T=1\n\nWe need to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\nStart at T=0, y=0, safe.\n\nAt T=0, freeway 8 is unsafe, but y=0 not freeway, so ok.\n\nWe need to be on freeways only when safe.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nSince min H=9, let's see if we can go straight up from T=0 to T=9.\n\ny_T at turn T.\n\nT=0: y=0, safe\n\nT=1: if we go up, y=1, but freeway 1, unsafe at T=2 only, not T=1, so at T=1, freeway 1 is safe? Freeway 1 unsafe only T=2.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nAt T=1, which freeways are unsafe?\n\nFreeway 1: safe at T=1, unsafe only T=2\n\nFreeway 2: same\n\nFreeway 3: unsafe only T=2\n\nFreeway 4: same\n\nFreeway 5: same\n\nFreeway 6: always safe\n\nFreeway 7: always safe\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at T=0 and T=1, so at T=1, freeway 8 is unsafe.\n\nBut freeway 8 is y=8.\n\nAt turn T, if y_T = k, and k freeway, need safe.\n\nFor T=1, if we are on y=1, freeway 1, which is safe at T=1.\n\nSimilarly, y=2, freeway 2, safe at T=1? T=1.\n\nFreeway 2 unsafe only T=2, so at T=1, safe.\n\nBut freeway 8 is unsafe at T=1.\n\nNow, for straight up:\n\nSuppose we go up every turn.\n\nStart T=0, y=0\n\nAction a_0: U, so y1=1 at T=1\n\nAt T=1, y=1, freeway 1, which is safe (since unsafe only T=2)\n\nAction a1: U, y2=2 at T=2\n\nAt T=2, y=2, freeway 2, but freeway 2 unsafe at T=2! Oh, collision.\n\ny=2 at T=2, freeway 2 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if we were on any other freeway at T=2, all freeways 1-5 unsafe at T=2 except 6 and 7.\n\nBut at T=2, if y=2, it's freeway 2, unsafe.\n\nIn the sequence, at T=2, if y=2, we hit.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on freeways 1-5 at T=2.\n\nAlso, freeway 8 unsafe at T=0 and T=1.\n\nNow, for min H, we need to reach y=9.\n\nSince at T=2, freeways 1-5 are unsafe, we should not be on them at T=2.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe, y=6 and y=7 always safe.\n\ny=6 and y=7 have no unsafe turns, so always safe to be on them.\n\nNow, to go straight up:\n\nAt T=1, we can be on y=1, safe.\n\nAt T=2, we cannot be on y=2, because unsafe.\n\nSo we need to not be on y=2 at T=2.\n\nSimilarly, not on y=1,3,4,5 at T=2? Freeways 1 to 5 all unsafe at T=2.\n\nFreeway 1: y=1, unsafe T=2\n\nFreeway 2: y=2, unsafe T=2\n\nFreeway 3: y=3, unsafe T=2\n\nFreeway 4: y=4, unsafe T=2\n\nFreeway 5: y=5, unsafe T=2\n\nFreeway 6: y=6, safe\n\nFreeway 7: y=7, safe\n\nFreeway 8: y=8, unsafe only T=0,1, so safe after T=2? T=2 and later safe.\n\nAt T=2, freeway 8 is safe since unsafe only T=0,1.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 safe.\n\nSo at T=2, we can be on y=0,6,7,8,9 safe.\n\ny=0,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut y=9 is goal.\n\nNow back to sequence.\n\nStart T=0, y=0.\n\nWe want to go to y=9.\n\nIf we go up at T=0: a0=U, then T=1, y=1 (freeway 1), safe since T=1 not unsafe for y=1.\n\nAt T=1, we need to choose action.\n\nIf we go up, a1=U, then T=2, y=2, but y=2 at T=2 unsafe, collision.\n\nSo we cannot go up at T=1.\n\nWe could go down or stay.\n\nBut going down might not help.\n\nAt T=1, y=1, we could stay: a1=S, then T=2, y=1, but y=1 at T=2 is freeway 1, unsafe at T=2, so still collision.\n\nOr go down: a1=D, then y2=0 at T=2.\n\nThen at T=2, y=0, which is safe.\n\nThen from there, we need to go up.\n\nBut we wasted a turn.\n\nWe could not go up at the beginning.\n\nSince y=6 and y=7 are always safe, we could go to them quickly, but we start from y=0.\n\nMin H=9 might not be possible if we hit the unsafe time.\n\nIn this case, at T=2, we cannot be on y=1,2,3,4,5.\n\nWe need to be on y=0,6,7,8,9 at T=2.\n\ny=9 is too far, since at T=1 we are at most y=1, so at T=2, y<=2 if we go up, or less.\n\nAt T=2, possible y: if we start from y=0 at T=0.\n\nAfter two actions: from T=0 to T=2.\n\nAt T=0, y0=0\n\na0: U, then y1=1 at T=1\n\na1: if U, y2=2 at T=2\n\nif S, y2=1 at T=2\n\nif D, y2=0 at T=2\n\na0: S, then y1=0 at T=1\n\na1: U, y2=1 at T=2\n\nor S, y2=0\n\nor D, y2=-1? But y in [0,9], so y2=0 if D, since min 0.\n\nSimilarly, a0: D, y1=0 at T=1 (since y=0, cannot go down, y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if y_t=0, a_t=D, y_{t+1}=0, similarly for up at 9.\n\nSo at T=2, possible y2: 0 or 1 or 2, depending on actions.\n\nSpecifically, y2 can be 0,1,2.\n\nBut at T=2, safe y are 0,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut y2=0,1,2; 1 and 2 not safe, only y2=0 safe among possible.\n\ny2=0,1,2; safe only if y2=0.\n\ny2=6,7,8 not possible since we start from 0, after two turns, max y=2.\n\nSo only way to be safe at T=2 is to have y2=0.\n\nThat means at T=2, we must be at y=0.\n\nHow? Either go down or stay to remain at 0.\n\nFor example:\n\nOption 1: at T=0, a0=S (stay), then y1=0 at T=1\n\nThen at T=1, a1=S or D, to have y2=0 at T=2.\n\nBut at T=1, if y1=0, safe, no freeway.\n\na1=S: y2=0\n\na1=D: y2=0\n\na1=U: y2=1, which at T=2 unsafe.\n\nSo to have y2=0, we need to not go up at T=1 if we are at y=0 T=1.\n\nIf we go up at T=0: a0=U, y1=1 at T=1\n\nThen at T=1, to have y2=0, we must go down: a1=D, y2=0.\n\nIf a1=S, y2=1, unsafe at T=2; a1=U, y2=2, unsafe.\n\nSo only by going down at T=1.\n\nSo essentially, to avoid collision at T=2, we must be at y=0 at T=2.\n\nWe can achieve that by:\n\n- Stay at T=0 and T=1: a0=S, a1=S, y1=0, y2=0\n\n- Or go up then down: a0=U, a1=D, y1=1, y2=0\n\nIn both cases, we are at y=0 at T=2, safe.\n\nNow, after T=2, the unsafe turn is passed, freeways 1-5 only unsafe at T=2, so after that, safe except for freeway 8 which is unsafe only T=0,1, so after T=1 safe.\n\nFreeway 8 unsafe T=0,1, so at T=2 and later, safe.\n\nFreeways 1-5 unsafe only T=2, so at T=3 and later, all safe except possibly other, but all covered.\n\nFreeway 6 and 7 always safe.\n\nSo from T=3 onwards, all freeways are safe at all times.\n\nOnly at T=2 we had issue.\n\nNow, at T=2, we are at y=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nFrom y=0 at T=2, we can go up as fast as possible.\n\nEach up move increases y by 1 per turn.\n\nTo go from y=0 to y=9, need 9 up moves, so min 9 turns from here.\n\nBut we are at T=2, y=2? No, at T=2, y=0.\n\nAfter action at T=2, y3.\n\nAt T=2, position y2=0.\n\nAction a2: if U, y3=1 at T=3\n\nThen continue.\n\nTo reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince from T=3 onwards, all safe, we can go straight up without delay.\n\nSo actions: from T=2, y=0\n\na2: U, y3=1 at T=3\n\na3: U, y4=2 at T=4\n\na4: U, y5=3 at T=5\n\na5: U, y6=4 at T=6\n\na6: U, y7=5 at T=7\n\na7: U, y8=6 at T=8\n\na8: U, y9=7 at T=9\n\na9: U, y10=8 at T=10\n\na10: U, y11=9 at T=11\n\ny11=9 at T=11.\n\nH is the number of turns? We start from turn 0.\n\nAfter actions from t=0 to H-1, at turn H, y_H.\n\nWe want y_H =9.\n\nHere at turn 11, y=9.\n\nSequence of actions from t=0 to t=10? Let's list.\n\nTurn sequence:\n\nTurn 0: action a0\n\nAfter a0, at turn 1, y1\n\n...\n\nAfter a_t, at turn t+1, y_{t+1}\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nWe start turn 0, y0=0.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn H, y_H.\n\nWe want y_H =9.\n\nIn the sequence above, with delays.\n\nFirst, to avoid T=2, we need to be at y=0 at T=2.\n\nOptions:\n\nOption A: a0=S, a1=S, then at T=2, y2=0\n\nThen a2=U, T=3 y3=1\n\na3=U, T=4 y4=2\n\na4=U, T=5 y5=3\n\na5=U, T=6 y6=4\n\na6=U, T=7 y7=5\n\na7=U, T=8 y8=6\n\na8=U, T=9 y9=7\n\na9=U, T=10 y10=8\n\na10=U, T=11 y11=9\n\nSo at T=11, y=9, H=11 actions? Actions from t=0 to t=10, 11 actions, turn 11.\n\nNumber of actions H, from t=0 to H-1, so after H actions, turn H.\n\ny_H=9.\n\nHere H=11.\n\nOption B: a0=U, a1=D, then at T=1 y1=1, T=2 y2=0\n\nThen same as above, from T=2 y=0, go up: a2=U, y3=1, ..., up to a10=U, y11=9.\n\nSame, H=11.\n\nBut can we reach earlier?\n\nSince after T=2, all safe, and we need to go from y=0 to y=9 in 9 turns min.\n\nAt T=2 we are at y=0, so earliest y=9 at T=11.\n\nBut is there a way to be at higher y at T=2?\n\nEarlier, at T=2, we can only be at y=0,1,2, and only y=0 safe.\n\ny=6 or 7 not possible.\n\nSo must be at y=0 at T=2.\n\nThus min H=11, with y11=9.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can be at y=9 earlier by going faster to safe rows.\n\nFor example, y=6 and y=7 always safe, so if we can be on them earlier.\n\nBut at T=0, y=0.\n\nAfter one action: a0=U, T=1 y=1\n\nOr a0=S, T=1 y=0\n\nOr a0=D, T=1 y=0\n\nAt T=1, we can be y=0 or y=1.\n\nBut at T=1, freeway 8 is unsafe, so if we are on y=8 at T=1, unsafe, but we are not, we are low.\n\ny=1 at T=1 is safe, as freeway 1 safe at T=1.\n\nNow, if we want to be at higher y later.\n\nSince at T=2 we must be at y=0, we lose two turns: from T=0 to T=2, we are still at y=0, whereas in ideal, we could be at y=2.\n\nBut we cannot because of unsafe.\n\nAfter T=2, we go up every turn.\n\nBut we have freeway 8 which was unsafe at T=0,1, but after safe.\n\nIn the path above, when we reach y=8, at T=10, which is after T=1, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut min H=11.\n\nBut let's see if we can avoid the delay by being on safe row at T=2.\n\nAt T=2, safe rows are y=0,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut y=6,7,8,9 not reachable from y=0 in two turns, since max y=2 at T=2.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nThus must have H>=11.\n\nWith H=11, we can achieve.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we have two choices for first two actions.\n\nEither stay twice: a0=S, a1=S\n\nOr up then down: a0=U, a1=D\n\nThen from there, all up.\n\nIn terms of number of actions, same.\n\nBut perhaps we can save one turn if we go to a safe row earlier, but no.\n\nAnother idea: since freeway 6 and 7 always safe, but we need to pass through lower rows.\n\nBut at T=2, we cannot be on y=1-5.\n\nBut after T=2, safe, so we can go through them.\n\nIn the sequence above, we start going up from T=2.\n\nBut at T=0 and T=1, we wasted actions by staying or going down.\n\nIn the up-down case, we went to y=1 and back, which might be better for something, but not necessary.\n\nNow, for the action sequence.\n\nWe need to output the actions from turn t_1=0.\n\nSo for example, with stay-stay:\n\nTurn 0: S\n\nTurn 1: S  (after this, at turn 2, y=0)\n\nThen Turn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 10: U, then at turn 11, y=9.\n\nActions from turn 0 to turn 10, 11 actions.\n\nSimilarly with up-down:\n\nTurn 0: U  (to y=1 at turn 1)\n\nTurn 1: D  (to y=0 at turn 2)\n\nThen turn 2: U\n\n...\n\nSame.\n\nNow, in the answer, we need the sequence of actions.\n\nBut let's list the turns.\n\nSince we start turn 0, and end turn H.\n\nIn the output, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + H -1: a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nAnd after that, at turn t_1 + H, y=9.\n\nIn this case t_1=0, so turn 0 to turn H-1 actions, turn H y=9.\n\nH=11, actions from turn 0 to turn 10.\n\nNow, we can choose either sequence.\n\nBut in the up-down case, we touch y=1 at turn 1, which is safe, then back.\n\nBut both work.\n\nTo minimize something, but both have same H.\n\nPerhaps we can go up faster after.\n\nBut no, we must go through each row.\n\nAnother thought: since y=6 and y=7 are always safe, but we still need to go through y=1 to5, which after T=2 are safe.\n\nFor example, at T=2, we are at y=0.\n\nInstead of going straight up, we could go to y=6 faster, but we can only change by 1 per turn, so from y=0 to y=6, min 6 turns, to y=9 min 9 turns.\n\nSame as before.\n\nNo shortcut.\n\nThus H=11 is min.\n\nNow, for the sequence, let's write it.\n\nFirst, with stay-stay:\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 0: S\n\nTurn 1: S\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nAt turn 0: after S, y still 0? Action at turn t affects y_{t+1}.\n\nTurn 0: action a0, after a0, at turn 1, y1.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nStart turn 0, y0=0\n\na0: S, then turn 1, y1=0\n\na1: S, turn 2, y2=0\n\na2: U, turn 3, y3=1\n\na3: U, turn 4, y4=2\n\na4: U, turn 5, y5=3\n\na5: U, turn 6, y6=4\n\na6: U, turn 7, y7=5\n\na7: U, turn 8, y8=6\n\na8: U, turn 9, y9=7\n\na9: U, turn 10, y10=8\n\na10: U, turn 11, y11=9\n\nYes.\n\nWith up-down:\n\na0: U, turn 1, y1=1\n\na1: D, turn 2, y2=0\n\na2: U, turn 3, y3=1\n\na3: U, turn 4, y4=2\n\n...\n\nSame as before, except first two actions different, but from turn 2 onwards same.\n\nIn this case, at turn 3, y=1 again, but it's fine.\n\nIn both cases, we reach y=9 at turn 11.\n\nIn the up-down case, we go to y=1 and back, which might be considered inefficient, but in terms of turns, same H.\n\nBut since we have to avoid T=2, it's necessary.\n\nIn the sequence, with stay-stay, we stay at y=0 for two extra turns.\n\nWith up-down, we go to y=1 and back.\n\nBut both achieve the same.\n\nPerhaps we can choose to output one.\n\nBut in the answer, we need the actions.\n\nNow, another thing: freeway 8 has a car that is unsafe at T=0 and T=1, but when we go to y=8, it is later, so safe.\n\nIn the sequence, we go to y=8 at turn 10, T=10, which is after T=1, so fine.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is a way with H=10 or less.\n\nSuppose we want y10=9.\n\nThat means from y0=0 to y10=9, net change +9, so must have 9 up moves and no down or stay, but with down or stay, net up would be less or same.\n\nIf we have only up moves, y_t = t for t=0 to 9, y9=9 at turn 9.\n\nBut at T=2, y=2, unsafe, collision.\n\nIf we have one down or stay, net up less than 9, so y10 <=8 if one down, or less, cannot be 9.\n\nFor example, if all up except one down, then at turn 10, y<=8, not 9.\n\nIf all up except one stay, y10=8 if start from 0.\n\ny0=0, after 10 actions: if 9 up and one stay, y10=8\n\nIf 10 up, y10=10, but y=10 not exist, max y=9, so if y_t=9, and a_t=U, y_{t+1}=9.\n\nSo to be at y=9 at turn H, we need exactly 9 up moves, and H-9 stays or downs, but downs would require more up later.\n\nLet U be number of up moves, D down, S stay, then net up: U - D.\n\ny_H = y0 + U - D = U - D, since y0=0.\n\nSet U - D =9.\n\nTotal actions H = U + D + S.\n\nSince U - D =9, then U = D + 9.\n\nH = (D + 9) + D + S = 2D + S + 9.\n\nH >= 9, and min when D=0, S=0, H=9.\n\nBut not possible due to collision.\n\nWith D>0 or S>0, H>9.\n\nIn our case, we have S or D in the first two turns.\n\nIn stay-stay: two S, so S=2, D=0, U=9? y_H = U - D =9.\n\nIn sequence, U=9 up moves, D=0 down, S=2 stay, then H=11, y11=9.\n\nSimilarly, up-down: one U, one D, so net U - D =0 for first two, but then we have U=10 up moves? In the sequence: a0=U, a1=D, a2 to a10=U, that is U: a0, a2,a3,...,a10: that's 10 U? a0=U, a2=U, a3=U,...,a10=U, that's 10 U, but a1=D.\n\nActions: 11 actions: a0 to a10.\n\na0:U, a1:D, a2:U, a3:U, a4:U, a5:U, a6:U, a7:U, a8:U, a9:U, a10:U\n\nU moves: a0, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9, a10: that's 10 U\n\nD moves: a1: one D\n\nS moves: none\n\nThen y11 = U - D =10 -1 =9, yes.\n\nH=11 actions.\n\nSimilarly, stay-stay: a0:S, a1:S, a2:U to a10:U, U=9 (a2 to a10), S=2 (a0,a1), D=0, U-D=9.\n\nH=11.\n\nCan we have H=10?\n\nH=10, y10=9.\n\nThen U - D =9.\n\nH= U + D + S =10.\n\nU - D =9.\n\nAdd: 2U + S =19, subtract: 2D + S =1.\n\nSo possible: if S=1, D=0, U=9.5? U integer, 2U + S =19, S=1, 2U=18, U=9.\n\nThen U - D =9, D=0.\n\nSo U=9, D=0, S=1.\n\nH=10 actions.\n\ny10=9.\n\nNow, with one stay and nine up moves.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on y=1,2,3,4,5 at T=2.\n\nAt T=2, y2 must be safe, i.e., y2=0,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut from y0=0, after two actions (t=0 and t=1), y2 can be 0,1,2.\n\nOnly 0 possible for safe.\n\ny2=0,1,2; safe only 0.\n\nBut y2=0.\n\nThen from there, to y10=9, with 9 up moves and one stay, but since we have to go from y=0 to y=9, with net 9 up, and one stay, it means we must have a stay somewhere, so we cannot reach y=9 by turn 10 if we have a stay.\n\nAt T=2, y2=0.\n\nThen from turn 2 to turn 10, 8 actions? Turn 2 to turn 10 is 8 turns later? Let's see turns.\n\nAt turn 2, y2=0.\n\nAfter actions from t=2 to t=9? Actions at turn t affect y_{t+1}.\n\nTo have y10=9.\n\nAfter actions from turn 2 to turn 9, 8 actions, to go from y2=0 to y10.\n\ny10 = y2 + net change from actions t=2 to t=9.\n\nActions t=2 to t=9: 8 actions.\n\ny10 = y2 + (U' - D') where U' up from t=2 to9, etc.\n\nBut y2=0, y10=9, so net U' - D' =9.\n\nWith 8 actions, max net up is 8 if all up, but 8<9, impossible to have net +9 in 8 actions.\n\nContradiction.\n\nActions from t=2 to t=9: let's list the actions affecting positions.\n\nAction at turn t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at turn t, action a_t, sets y_{t+1}.\n\nThus, y_{k} is set by action a_{k-1} for k>=1.\n\ny0 given.\n\ny1 set by a0\n\ny2 set by a1\n\ny3 set by a2\n\n...\n\ny10 set by a9\n\nTo have y10=9, set by a9.\n\nNow, with H=10 actions: from t=0 to t=9.\n\ny10 set by a9.\n\nWe need y10=9.\n\ny0=0.\n\nThe values y_t for t=0 to 9.\n\nFor T=2, y2 must be safe, y2=0.\n\ny2 is set by a1.\n\nSo after a1, y2=0.\n\ny2=0.\n\nNow, to have y10=9.\n\ny10 is set by a9.\n\nThe sequence from y2 to y10.\n\ny2=0 at turn 2.\n\ny3 set by a2, y4 by a3, ..., y10 by a9.\n\nSo from turn 2 to turn 10, 8 positions: y2 to y9? y2 to y10, but y10 is at turn 10.\n\ny2 at turn 2, y3 at turn 3, ..., y10 at turn 10.\n\nNumber of steps: from turn 2 to turn 10, 8 intervals, 8 actions: a2 to a9.\n\nActions a2 to a9 determine y3 to y10.\n\ny2 is fixed at 0.\n\nWe need y10=9.\n\nSo with 8 actions (a2 to a9), we need to go from y2=0 to y10=9.\n\nNet change: +9.\n\nBut with 8 actions, max increase 8, min decrease, but net increase max 8, cannot be 9.\n\nImpossible.\n\nFor example, if all a2 to a9 U, then y3=1, y4=2, ..., y10=8, which is 8, not 9.\n\nIf we have one more up, but only 8 actions.\n\nSo impossible to have y10=9 with y2=0.\n\nSimilarly, if y2 were higher, but y2 must be 0, which is low.\n\nThus H=10 impossible.\n\nSimilarly, H=9 impossible as before.\n\nThus min H=11.\n\nWith H=11 actions from t=0 to t=10, y11=9.\n\nNow for the sequence.\n\nIn the answer, we need to list the actions.\n\nNow, we can use either stay-stay or up-down for the first.\n\nBut in up-down, at turn 1, we are on freeway 1 at T=1, which is safe, as we checked.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps stay-stay is simpler.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nAlso, in the output, it should be for turn t_1=0.\n\nSo actions from turn 0 to turn 10.\n\nBut the sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so t from 0 to 10, 11 actions.\n\nIn the box.\n\nNow, I think we can do:\n\nFor example, with all up after, but first two to stay.\n\nSince freeway 8 is unsafe at T=0 and T=1, but we are not on it then.\n\nIn the sequence, when we go to y=8, it is at turn 10, T=10, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut let's list the actions clearly.\n\nI think both sequences are fine.\n\nPerhaps we can output the stay-stay one.\n\nBut let's see if we can start going up immediately to save time, but we have to go down or stay later to avoid T=2.\n\nIn up-down, we go up at turn 0, which might be better psychologically, but no difference.\n\nNow, another point: in freeway 8, there is a car at (0,-11,right,6), at T=0, span [-11,0], so 0 in span, unsafe.\n\nAt T=1, span [-5,6], 0 in, unsafe.\n\nBut at T=2, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nIn our path, we reach y=8 at T=10, which is fine.\n\nBut we need to make sure that when we are on other rows, no issue.\n\nI think it's ok.\n\nSo for the sequence, let's write:\n\nTurn 0: S\n\nTurn 1: S\n\nTurn 2: U\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nAfter turn 10 action U, at turn 11, y=9.\n\nBut the sequence includes actions up to turn 10.\n\nIn the answer format, it should list the actions for the turns.\n\nSince t_1=0, and H=11.\n\nIn the box.\n\nPerhaps we can write it as:\n\nBut let's confirm the car states again.\n\nFreeway 3,4,5 have cars that are unsafe only at T=2, but we avoided.\n\nIn the sequence, with stay at beginning, we are at y=0 at T=1 and T=2, safe.\n\nThen go up.\n\nNow, for the output.\n\nThe answer should be the sequence.\n\nPerhaps we can use the up-down to have some progress.\n\nBut not necessary.\n\nI think either is fine.\n\nLet's use the up-down sequence for variety.\n\nTurn 0: U  (to y=1 at turn 1)\n\nTurn 1: D  (to y=0 at turn 2)\n\nTurn 2: U  (to y=1 at turn 3)\n\nTurn 3: U  (to y=2 at turn 4)\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 10: U (to y=9 at turn 11)\n\nActions:\n\nt=0: U\n\nt=1: D\n\nt=2: U\n\nt=3: U\n\nt=4: U\n\nt=5: U\n\nt=6: U\n\nt=7: U\n\nt=8: U\n\nt=9: U\n\nt=10: U\n\nIn this, from t=2 to t=10 all U, that's 9 U, but t=2 to t=10 is 9 actions? t=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10: 9 actions.\n\nt=0: U, t=1: D, t=2:U, ..., t=10:U.\n\nNumber of actions: t=0 to t=10, 11 actions.\n\ny: after t=0 U, y1=1\n\nt=1 D, y2=0\n\nt=2 U, y3=1\n\nt=3 U, y4=2\n\nt=4 U, y5=3\n\nt=5 U, y6=4\n\nt=6 U, y7=5\n\nt=7 U, y8=6\n\nt=8 U, y9=7\n\nt=9 U, y10=8\n\nt=10 U, y11=9\n\nYes.\n\nIn this, at turn 3, y=1, which is after T=2, so freeway 1 is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nIn the stay-stay, at turn 3 y=1 same.\n\nSo both reach at same time.\n\nI think we can output.\n\nNow for the answer format.\n\nIt should be in a box.\n\nSo for example:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 0: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 1: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\end{array} }\n\nWith up-down:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 0: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 1: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\end{array} }\n\nIn the up-down, at turn 0, we go to y=1, which is fine, and at turn 1, we are on freeway 1 at T=1, safe, then down to y=0 at T=2, safe.\n\nThen up.\n\nI think both are valid.\n\nPerhaps the up-down has the advantage that we \"scouted\" or something, but no real difference.\n\nIn terms of the car, at T=1 on freeway 1, it is safe, as we calculated.\n\nTo be consistent, I can use the stay-stay.\n\nBut in the problem, it says \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", so either.\n\nNow, I think we should write the sequence.\n\nAnother thing: in freeway 6 and 7, no cars, so always safe, but we don't use them early.\n\nBut not necessary.\n\nSo I think H=11 is min.\n\nNow for the output.\n\nIn the sequence, for the stay-stay, turns 0 and 1 are S, then U all.\n\nIn the answer, it should be for turn t_1=0.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) is 11. This requires a sequence of 11 actions from turn \\(t_1 = 0\\) to turn 10, resulting in position \\(y_{11} = 9\\).\n\nThe sequence avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring that at turn \\(T = 2\\), the player is not on any freeway from \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 5\\), as these are unsafe due to car spans including \\(x = 0\\). Specifically:\n- Freeways 1 to 5 are unsafe only at \\(T = 2\\).\n- Freeway 8 is unsafe at \\(T = 0\\) and \\(T = 1\\), but safe thereafter.\n- Freeways 6 and 7 are always safe.\n\nTo achieve this, the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) at \\(T = 2\\). This can be done by either:\n- Staying at \\(y = 0\\) for the first two turns (actions: S, S), or\n- Moving up to \\(y = 1\\) at \\(T = 1\\) and then down to \\(y = 0\\) at \\(T = 2\\) (actions: U, D).\n\nAfter \\(T = 2\\), all freeways are safe at all times, so the player can move up directly to \\(y = 9\\) without delay.\n\nThe sequence using the \"stay-stay\" approach for the first two actions is as follows:\n\n- **Turn 0: S** (stay, so \\(y_1 = 0\\) at turn 1)\n- **Turn 1: S** (stay, so \\(y_2 = 0\\) at turn 2, safe since not on a freeway)\n- **Turn 2: U** (up, so \\(y_3 = 1\\) at turn 3)\n- **Turn 3: U** (up, so \\(y_4 = 2\\) at turn 4)\n- **Turn 4: U** (up, so \\(y_5 = 3\\) at turn 5)\n- **Turn 5: U** (up, so \\(y_6 = 4\\) at turn 6)\n- **Turn 6: U** (up, so \\(y_7 = 5\\) at turn 7)\n- **Turn 7: U** (up, so \\(y_8 = 6\\) at turn 8)\n- **Turn 8: U** (up, so \\(y_9 = 7\\) at turn 9)\n- **Turn 9: U** (up, so \\(y_{10} = 8\\) at turn 10)\n- **Turn 10: U** (up, so \\(y_{11} = 9\\) at turn 11)\n\nThis sequence ensures:\n- At \\(T = 0\\), \\(y = 0\\) (safe, no freeway).\n- At \\(T = 1\\), \\(y = 0\\) (safe, no freeway).\n- At \\(T = 2\\), \\(y = 0\\) (safe, no freeway).\n- From \\(T = 3\\) to \\(T = 10\\), the player moves through freeways 1 to 8, all of which are safe after \\(T = 2\\).\n- Specifically, when on freeway 8 at \\(T = 10\\), it is safe since freeway 8 is only unsafe at \\(T = 0\\) and \\(T = 1\\).\n\nThe \"up-down\" approach (actions: U, D for turns 0 and 1) also achieves \\(H = 11\\) and is valid, but the \"stay-stay\" sequence is chosen for simplicity.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 0: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 1: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 2: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The cars are moving, and I have to make sure that when I'm on a freeway row at a certain turn, I don't collide with any car that has its span including x=0 at that turn.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements. The cars are on specific freeways, and for each turn after t_1, their positions change based on their speed and direction.\n\nt_1 is given as 1, so current turn is t=1, player is at (0,0).\n\nI need to find actions for t=1, t=2, etc., until I reach y=9.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and it's not a freeway, so no cars there, so once I reach y=9, I'm safe.\n\nThe freeways are from y=1 to y=8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, I think. y=0 is where I start, and y=9 is the goal.\n\nNow, collision happens only if at turn T, I'm on a freeway row y_T, and for that row, there is a car whose span includes 0 at that turn.\n\nThe note says that if I move to y_{T+1} at turn T, I'm not considered on y_{T+1} until turn T+1, so at turn T, I'm still on y_T for collision purposes.\n\nLet me read that note carefully.\n\n\"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_{T} at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nSo, at turn T, when I perform the action, I am still on y_T, and I move to y_{T+1} for the next turn. So collision is checked based on y_T at turn T.\n\nSimilarly, when I arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1, collision is checked based on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nSo, to avoid collision, when I am on a freeway row at turn T, no car on that row should have its span including 0 at turn T.\n\nNow, the car spans are given at turn t_1=1, and I need to find their spans at future turns.\n\nLet me list all the cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, head 12, tail 47, direction left, speed 36. Since direction left, it's moving left, so span is [h, τ] with h=12, τ=47? That can't be right because if it's moving left, head should be less than tail or something? Let me read the update.\n\nFor left-moving car: Span(t_1) = [h, τ], and at T, [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (12,47,left,36)\n\nBut if h=12, τ=47, and moving left, at time t_1, span is [12,47], which from 12 to 47, but since it's left-moving, it should be decreasing, so head at 12, tail at 47 means the car is from x=12 to x=47, and moving left, so at time T, it shifts left.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, span [τ, h] or something? Let's see.\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → at T, [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, for example, freeway 3: (60,49,right,12) but [τ,h] = [49,60]? It says (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nIn the car state, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nBut for direction, it might be inconsistent.\n\nFor left-moving, head h and tail τ, with Span = [h, τ] meaning from h to τ, but if moving left, h should be the front, so if h=12, τ=47, and moving left, front at 12, back at 47, so the car occupies from min to max? No.\n\nIn the update, for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ], and at T, [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIf h=12, τ=47, at t_1, it occupies x from 12 to 47 inclusive, I assume.\n\nMoving left at speed 36, so at time T, it occupies [12 - 36(T-1), 47 - 36(T-1)]\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], for example, (60,49,right,12), so τ=60, h=49? That seems odd.\n\nLet's see the entry: for freeway 3: (60,49,right,12), and direction right, so Span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [60,49]? But [60,49] is from 60 to 49, which is backwards, or is it [min,max]?\n\nI think there's confusion in notation.\n\nPerhaps for right-moving, they define head and tail differently.\n\nIn the update rule: for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIf τ and h, with τ < h or something.\n\nIn the example, (60,49,right,12), if τ=60, h=49, then [τ, h] = [60,49], which is decreasing, but then at T, [60 + s(T-1), 49 + s(T-1)], so if s>0, it increases, so from 60 to 49 is invalid if 60>49.\n\n49 to 60 would be increasing.\n\nI think there might be a mistake in the notation.\n\nPerhaps for all cars, head is the front, tail is the back.\n\nFor left-moving, front at smaller x, back at larger x, so span [h, τ] with h < τ.\n\nFor right-moving, front at larger x, back at smaller x, so span [τ, h] with τ < h? But in [τ, h], if τ < h, it's increasing.\n\nIn the update, for left-moving, [h, τ] with h and τ, and h - s dt, τ - s dt, so if moving left, both decrease.\n\nFor right-moving, [τ, h] with τ and h, and τ + s dt, h + s dt, both increase.\n\nIn the car list, for freeway 1: (12,47,left,36), so h=12, τ=47, since left-moving, front at 12, back at 47, so span [12,47].\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 3: (60,49,right,12), but if right-moving, front should be at larger x, so h=60, τ=49, so front at 60, back at 49, so span [τ, h] = [49,60], which makes sense, from 49 to 60.\n\nThen at T, [49 + s(T-1), 60 + s(T-1)].\n\nSimilarly, for (24,13,right,12), h=24, τ=13, so span [13,24].\n\nAnd (-12,-23,right,12), h=-12, τ=-23, so span [-23,-12].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nOkay, that makes sense.\n\nSo let's list all cars per freeway at t_1=1.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, left-moving, h=12, τ=47, s=36, span at t: [12 - 36(t-1), 47 - 36(t-1)]\n\nSince t_1=1, at turn T, the span is [12 - 36(T-1), 47 - 36(T-1)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? (12,47,left,36), identical to freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars:\n\nFirst: (60,49,right,12) → h=60, τ=49, right, s=12, span at t: [49 + 12(t-1), 60 + 12(t-1)]\n\nSecond: (24,13,right,12) → h=24, τ=13, right, s=12, span [13 + 12(t-1), 24 + 12(t-1)]\n\nThird: (-12,-23,right,12) → h=-12, τ=-23, right, s=12, span [-23 + 12(t-1), -12 + 12(t-1)]\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3, three identical cars.\n\n(60,49,right,12), (24,13,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nFreeway 5: same as above.\n\nFreeway 6: one car, (54,43,right,6) → h=54, τ=43, right, s=6, span [43 + 6(t-1), 54 + 6(t-1)]\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway 6, (54,43,right,6)\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: first (54,43,right,6) same as above, and second (6,-5,right,6) → h=6, τ=-5, right, s=6, span [-5 + 6(t-1), 6 + 6(t-1)]\n\nNow, I need to find when these spans include 0 at various turns.\n\nSince the player starts at y=0 at t=1, and I need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns might be 8, since I need to move up 9 steps, but I can move up, down, or stay, so it could be more if I have to avoid cars.\n\nBut since I can only change y by -1,0,1 each turn, from y=0 to y=9, minimum 9 actions, but since I start at t=1, and after H actions, at turn t=1+H, I should be at y=9.\n\nLet's clarify the turns.\n\nAt turn t, I perform action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThe position is given at turn t_1, which is (0, y_{t_1}), and after action a_{t_1}, I go to y_{t_1 +1}, and so on.\n\nIn the sequence, I need actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1}, so H actions, and after that, at turn t_1 + H, I should be at y=9.\n\nStarting from y_{t_1} =0 at t=1, so after H actions, at turn 1+H, y_{1+H} =9.\n\nThe number of turns from start to finish is H, meaning H actions.\n\nNow, to minimize H, I should go up as fast as possible, but avoid the cars on rows 1 to 8 when I am on them.\n\nI need to find for each freeway row, at which turns it is safe to be on that row, i.e., no car has span including 0 at that turn.\n\nThen I can plan a path through the rows over time.\n\nSince I can stay or move down, I might need to wait or go around, but since the rows are linear, and cars move, I need to time my crossing.\n\nFirst, let's find for each row, the times when it is unsafe, i.e., when some car on that row has 0 in its span.\n\nThen the safe times are when no car has 0 in span.\n\nSince multiple cars per row, I need for each row, the set of turns T where for all cars on that row, 0 not in span at T.\n\nBut actually, collision if any car has 0 in span at T.\n\nSo for row to be safe at T, all cars must have 0 not in their span at T.\n\nSo I need for each row, the times T when no car covers x=0.\n\nThen I can be on that row only at those times.\n\nNow, t starts from 1, and we consider integer turns.\n\nLet me define the span for each car as a function of T.\n\nSet t_1=1.\n\nFor freeway 1: one car, left-moving, span at T: [12 - 36(T-1), 47 - 36(T-1)]\n\n0 in span if 12 - 36(T-1) <= 0 <= 47 - 36(T-1)\n\nSince the car is moving left, the span is decreasing.\n\nLower bound L = 12 - 36(T-1)\n\nUpper bound U = 47 - 36(T-1)\n\n0 in [L,U] if L <= 0 <= U\n\nSo 12 - 36(T-1) <= 0 and 0 <= 47 - 36(T-1)\n\nFirst inequality: 12 - 36(T-1) <= 0 => 12 <= 36(T-1) => (T-1) >= 12/36 = 1/3, so T-1 >= 1 since T integer, T-1 >=1, T>=2\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 47 - 36(T-1) => 36(T-1) <= 47 => T-1 <= 47/36 ≈ 1.305, so T-1 <=1 since integer, T<=2\n\nT-1 <=1, T<=2\n\nAnd T>=2 from first.\n\nSo T=2 only.\n\nFirst: 12 - 36(T-1) <=0 => 36(T-1) >=12 => T-1 >= 12/36 = 1/3, so T-1 >=1, T>=2\n\nSecond: 0 <= 47 - 36(T-1) => 36(T-1) <=47 => T-1 <= 47/36 ≈1.305, so T-1 <=1, T<=2\n\nThus T=2.\n\nSo for freeway 1, unsafe only at T=2.\n\nAt T=1, L=12 -36(0) =12, U=47, 12 to 47, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nAt T=2, L=12-36(1)= -24, U=47-36=11, -24 to 11, 0 in, unsafe.\n\nAt T=3, L=12-72= -60, U=47-72= -25, -60 to -25, 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly for other T, always safe except T=2.\n\nFreeway 2 is same as freeway 1, so also unsafe only at T=2.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (60,49,right,12) → span at T: [49 +12(T-1), 60 +12(T-1)]\n\n0 in span if 49 +12(T-1) <= 0 <= 60 +12(T-1)\n\nBut 49 +12(T-1) >=49 >0 for T>=1, so lower bound >0, so 0 not in span ever, since min x is 49 at T=1, increasing.\n\nSimilarly, upper bound min 60>0, so never includes 0.\n\nSecond car: (24,13,right,12) → span [13 +12(T-1), 24 +12(T-1)]\n\nLower bound 13 +12(T-1) >=13>0, so always positive, never <=0, so 0 never in span.\n\nThird car: (-12,-23,right,12) → h=-12, τ=-23, span [-23 +12(T-1), -12 +12(T-1)]\n\n0 in span if -23 +12(T-1) <= 0 <= -12 +12(T-1)\n\nFirst inequality: -23 +12(T-1) <=0 => 12(T-1) <=23 => T-1 <= 23/12 ≈1.916, so T-1 <=1, T<=2\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -12 +12(T-1) => 12 <= 12(T-1) => T-1 >=1, T>=2\n\nSo T=2 only.\n\nThus for freeway 3, only the third car can have 0 in span at T=2, and others never, so unsafe at T=2 only.\n\nAt T=1: for third car, span [-23 +0, -12 +0] = [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nAt T=2: [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], 0 in, unsafe.\n\nAt T=3: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo yes, unsafe only at T=2.\n\nFreeway 4 same as freeway 3, so unsafe only T=2.\n\nFreeway 5 same, unsafe only T=2.\n\nNow freeway 6: one car (54,43,right,6) → span [43 +6(T-1), 54 +6(T-1)]\n\nLower bound 43>0, so always positive, never includes 0. Safe at all times.\n\nSimilarly freeway 7 same, safe at all times.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (54,43,right,6) same as above, never unsafe.\n\nSecond car: (6,-5,right,6) → h=6, τ=-5, span [-5 +6(T-1), 6 +6(T-1)]\n\n0 in span if -5 +6(T-1) <= 0 <= 6 +6(T-1)\n\nFirst inequality: -5 +6(T-1) <=0 => 6(T-1) <=5 => T-1 <= 5/6 ≈0.833, so T-1 <=0 since integer? T-1 <=0, T<=1\n\nBut T>=1, T-1 >=0.\n\nT-1 <= 5/6, since T-1 integer, T-1 <= 0 (since 0 <= 5/6? 5/6<1, so T-1 <=0, so T<=1)\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 6 +6(T-1) => always true since 6 +6(T-1) >=6>0 for T>=1.\n\nNow, -5 +6(T-1) <=0 for T-1 <= 5/6, so for T=1: -5 +0 = -5 <=0 true, and 0 <=6+0=6 true, so at T=1, 0 in span.\n\nFor T=2: -5+6=1 >0, so -5+6(T-1)=1>0, so lower bound 1>0, so 0 not <= upper bound? 0 <= 6+6=12 true, but lower bound 1>0, so 0 < lower bound, not in span.\n\nSimilarly for T>2, lower bound larger.\n\nSo only at T=1, 0 in span for this car.\n\nNow for freeway 8, the first car never unsafe, second car unsafe only at T=1.\n\nSo freeway 8 unsafe only at T=1.\n\nNow, summarize for each row, safe times:\n\ny=1: unsafe at T=2, safe otherwise.\n\ny=2: same as y=1, unsafe at T=2 only.\n\ny=3: unsafe at T=2 only.\n\ny=4: unsafe at T=2 only.\n\ny=5: unsafe at T=2 only.\n\ny=6: always safe.\n\ny=7: always safe.\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=1 only, safe otherwise.\n\ny=8 unsafe only at T=1.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 at t=1 to y=9.\n\nAt turn T, I am on row y_T.\n\nI start at t=1, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn, say after H actions.\n\nThe actions: at turn t, I choose a_t, which sets y_{t+1} = y_t + delta y, with delta y in {-1,0,1}, and y_{t+1} clamped to [0,9].\n\nSince I start at y=0, and want to go up, probably no need to go below 0.\n\nNow, to minimize H, I should go up as fast as possible, but need to avoid being on unsafe rows at unsafe times.\n\nSpecifically, for each row, I must not be on it when it is unsafe.\n\nNow, let's list the unsafe times per row:\n\nRow 1: unsafe at T=2\n\nRow 2: unsafe at T=2\n\nRow 3: unsafe at T=2\n\nRow 4: unsafe at T=2\n\nRow 5: unsafe at T=2\n\nRow 6: always safe\n\nRow 7: always safe\n\nRow 8: unsafe at T=1\n\nSince row 8 is unsafe only at T=1, and I start at T=1 on y=0, not on row 8, so I can be on row 8 at other times.\n\nNow, the critical point is that multiple rows are unsafe at T=2.\n\nI need to be on row y at turn T for collision check.\n\nI start at t=1, y=0.\n\nAt turn t=1, I am on y=0, which is safe, no cars.\n\nI perform action a_1, which determines y_2.\n\nThen at turn t=2, I am on y_2, and collision check for row y_2 at t=2.\n\nSimilarly, at turn t, on y_t, check row y_t at time t.\n\nNow, I need to reach y_t=9 for some t.\n\nSince y=9 has no cars, it's always safe.\n\nNow, the minimal H: if I could go directly up, from y=0 to y=9 in 9 moves, so H=9 actions, from t=1 to t=10, y_{10}=9.\n\nBut I might be blocked.\n\nNow, at t=2, many rows are unsafe: y=1,2,3,4,5 are all unsafe at t=2.\n\nThat means at turn t=2, I must not be on any of these rows, so I must be on y=0,6,7,8, or9.\n\nBut at t=1, I am on y=0.\n\nAfter action a_1, I go to y_2.\n\nSo at t=2, y_2 must be one of 0,6,7,8,9 to be safe, since y=1-5 unsafe at t=2.\n\ny=8 is unsafe at t=1, but at t=2, y=8 is safe, since unsafe only t=1.\n\ny=8 unsafe at T=1, safe for T>1.\n\nAt t=2, y=8 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 and7 always safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nSo at t=2, safe rows: 0,6,7,8,9.\n\nNow, from y=0 at t=1, with a_1, I can go to y=1 (U), or y=0 (S), or y=-1 but clamped to 0, so y=0 or y=1.\n\na_1: if U, y_2=1; if S, y_2=0; if D, y_2= max(0-1,0)=0.\n\nSo from y=0, possible y_2: 0 or 1.\n\nBut at t=2, if y_2=1, row y=1 is unsafe at t=2, so collision.\n\nTherefore, I cannot go to y=1 at t=2.\n\nIf I stay at y=0 or go down, but down to 0, so y_2=0 is safe.\n\nSo for a_1, I must choose S or D, so that y_2=0, not U.\n\nThen at t=2, I am on y=0, safe.\n\nNow, at turn t=2, I perform a_2, which sets y_3.\n\nI need to go up eventually.\n\nNow, after t=2, for t>2, the unsafe times are only for t=2, which has passed, so for t>=3, all rows are safe at all times, except that y=8 was unsafe at t=1, but t=1 is past, so for t>=3, all y=1 to8 are safe at all times? Let's confirm.\n\nFrom above:\n\ny=1: unsafe only t=2\n\ny=2: only t=2\n\n...\n\ny=5: only t=2\n\ny=6: always safe\n\ny=7: always safe\n\ny=8: unsafe only t=1\n\nSo for t>=3, all freeways are safe at all times, since no other unsafe times.\n\ny=8 unsafe only at t=1, so for t>=2, y=8 is safe? t=2 is safe, as we said.\n\nt=1 is past.\n\nSo yes, for turns t >= 3, every row y=1 to 8 is safe, no matter when.\n\nTherefore, once t>=3, I can move freely up without any issue.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nNow, at t=2, I am at y=0, as I must be.\n\nNow, at t=2, I can choose a_2 to go to y_3.\n\ny_3 can be 0 (S or D), or 1 (U).\n\nSince for t>=3, all safe, I can start moving up.\n\nBut I need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal way: from y=0 at t=2, I can go up as fast as possible.\n\nAt t=2, y=0.\n\na_2: if U, y_3=1\n\nThen at t=3, on y=1, safe (since t>=3)\n\na_3: U, y_4=2\n\n...\n\nUp to y_9=8 at t=9? Let's see the turns.\n\nTurn t: at turn t, I am at y_t, perform a_t, go to y_{t+1}.\n\nStart: t=1, y_1=0\n\nAfter a_1, y_2=0 (as we must)\n\nt=2, y_2=0, perform a_2, go to y_3.\n\nIf a_2=U, y_3=1\n\nt=3, y_3=1, perform a_3, if U, y_4=2\n\n...\n\nContinue: at t=8, y_8=7, if U, y_9=8\n\nt=9, y_9=8, if U, y_10=9\n\nThen at t=10, y_10=9, which is the goal.\n\nNow, H actions: from a_1 to a_9? Let's see.\n\nActions: a_1 at t=1, a_2 at t=2, ..., a_9 at t=9, then y_{10}=9.\n\nSo H=9 actions.\n\nSequence: t=1 to t=9, 9 actions.\n\nBut can I do better?\n\nFrom y=0 at t=2, if I go up faster? But each step I can only increase by 1, so from y=0 to y=9, need at least 9 steps, but I start at y_1=0, after 9 actions, y_{10}=9, so 9 is minimum, since I need to increase by 9.\n\nUnless I start moving earlier, but at t=1, I cannot go up because if I go to y=1 at t=2, unsafe.\n\nSo I must stay at y=0 at t=2.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 9.\n\nIn the sequence above, I have to go through all rows.\n\nBut since for t>=3, all rows are safe, I can go up directly.\n\nIn the sequence: a_1 must be S or D, so y_2=0.\n\nThen a_2: I can choose U, to go to y_3=1.\n\nThen a_3: U, y_4=2\n\na_4: U, y_5=3\n\na_5: U, y_6=4\n\na_6: U, y_7=5\n\na_7: U, y_8=6\n\na_8: U, y_9=7\n\na_9: U, y_{10}=8? y_9=7? Let's list:\n\nAt t=1: y_1=0\n\nAfter a_1: y_2=0 (with a_1=S or D)\n\nt=2: y_2=0, after a_2=U, y_3=1\n\nt=3: y_3=1, after a_3=U, y_4=2\n\nt=4: y_4=2, after a_4=U, y_5=3\n\nt=5: y_5=3, after a_5=U, y_6=4\n\nt=6: y_6=4, after a_6=U, y_7=5\n\nt=7: y_7=5, after a_7=U, y_8=6\n\nt=8: y_8=6, after a_8=U, y_9=7\n\nt=9: y_9=7, after a_9=U, y_{10}=8\n\ny_{10}=8, not 9.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\ny_9=7, after U, y_{10}=8.\n\nThen at t=10, y_{10}=8, I need to go to y=9.\n\nSo at t=10, perform a_{10}, U, to y_{11}=9.\n\nThen at t=11, y_{11}=9, which is goal.\n\nBut H actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1}, so t_1=1, actions from a_1 to a_{1+H-1}, and after that, at turn 1+H, position should be (0,9).\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t=1+H, y_{1+H} should be 9.\n\nIn above, if I have actions up to a_{10}, then after a_{10}, y_{11}=9, so turn t=11.\n\nH actions: a_1 to a_H, then at turn 1+H, y_{1+H}.\n\nSet y_{1+H} =9.\n\nStart from y_1=0.\n\nAfter k actions, y_{1+k} = y_1 + sum of delta y.\n\nSince I need to increase by 9, and each action can increase by at most 1, I need at least 9 actions to increase by 9.\n\nMinimal H=9.\n\nWith H=9 actions, y_{10} should be 9.\n\nIn the sequence above, with a_1=S, y_2=0\n\na_2=U, y_3=1\n\n...\n\nup to a_9=U, y_{10}=?\n\ny_1=0\n\ny_2=0 (after a_1)\n\ny_3=1 (after a_2=U)\n\ny_4=2 (a_3=U)\n\ny_5=3 (a_4=U)\n\ny_6=4 (a_5=U)\n\ny_7=5 (a_6=U)\n\ny_8=6 (a_7=U)\n\ny_9=7 (a_8=U)  // at t=9, y_9=7\n\nAfter a_9, y_{10}= y_9 + delta, if a_9=U, y_{10}=8\n\nBut I need y_{10}=9, so I need to be at y_9=8, then U to 9.\n\nBut in above, y_9=7, so y_{10}=8, not 9.\n\nI missed one step.\n\nFrom y_1=0 to y_10=9, I need to increase by 9 in 9 steps? From t=1 to t=10, 9 intervals, 9 actions.\n\ny_1=0\n\nAfter 9 actions, y_{10} = y_1 + sum_{t=1 to 9} delta y_t\n\nEach delta y_t <=1, so y_{10} <= 0 + 9*1 =9, and to reach 9, must have all delta y_t =1 for t=1 to9? But not necessarily, because I stayed at t=1.\n\ny_1=0\n\nAfter first action a_1, y_2 = y_1 + delta y_1\n\nIn this case, I set a_1=S or D, so delta y_1=0, y_2=0\n\nThen a_2=U, delta y_2=1, y_3=1\n\na_3=U, y_4=2\n\n...\n\na_8=U, y_9=7\n\na_9=U, y_{10}=8\n\ny_{10}=8, not 9.\n\nThen I need one more action: a_{10}=U, y_{11}=9.\n\nSo at turn t=11, y_{11}=9.\n\nThus with 10 actions: a_1 to a_{10}, y_{11}=9.\n\nH=10.\n\nBut is there a way with H=9?\n\nTo have y_{10}=9, I need to be at y_9=8 or 9, and go to 9.\n\nBut from above, with the delay at start, y_9=7, so I need to start moving earlier or something.\n\nBut at t=1, I cannot go up, because if a_1=U, y_2=1, but at t=2, y=1 is unsafe.\n\nSo I must have y_2=0.\n\nThus, the earliest I can be at y=1 is t=3, with y_3=1.\n\nThen y_4=2 at t=4, ..., y_9=7 at t=9, y_{10}=8 at t=10, y_{11}=9 at t=11.\n\nSo it takes 10 actions to go from y=0 to y=9 with the constraint.\n\nH=10 actions.\n\nBut let me confirm the turns.\n\nStart: turn t=1, position y_1=0\n\nAfter action a_1, position at t=2 is y_2\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_k, position at t=1+k is y_{1+k}\n\nAfter H actions, position at t=1+H.\n\nWe want y_{1+H} =9.\n\nWith H=10, y_{11}=9.\n\nCan I reach y_{10}=9?\n\nThat would require y_{10}=9.\n\nAt turn t=10, y_{10}=9.\n\nBut to have y_{10}=9, I need to have y_9 such that after a_9, y_{10}=9, so y_9=8 or 9, and a_9=U or S.\n\nBut y_9 must be 8 or 9 at t=9.\n\nNow, when can I reach y=8?\n\nEarliest: if I could be at y=1 at t=2, but I cannot, because at t=2, y=1 unsafe.\n\nSo I can be at y=1 only at t=3 or later.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 at t=4 or later, ..., up to y=8 at t=10 or later.\n\ny=1 at t=3: possible, with a_2=U from y_2=0.\n\nThen y_2=0 at t=2, a_2=U, y_3=1 at t=3.\n\nThen y_4=2 at t=4, ..., y_9=7 at t=9? From y_3=1 at t=3, after 6 ups, y_9=7 at t=9.\n\nThen to y_{10}=8, not 9.\n\nTo be at y=8 at t=9, I need to start from higher earlier.\n\nBut I cannot be on y=1 before t=3.\n\nSimilarly, I cannot reach y=8 before t=10.\n\nBecause: to be at y=k at turn t, I need to have started from y=0 at t=1, and moved up.\n\nBut with the first move delayed.\n\nThe first time I can be on a freeway row is t=3 for y=1.\n\nThen t=4 for y=2, ..., t=10 for y=8? y=1 at t=3, y=2 at t=4, ..., y=8 at t=10.\n\nThen at t=10, y=8, I can go to y=9 at t=11.\n\nSo y_{11}=9.\n\nIf at t=10, I am at y=8, and go to y=9.\n\nBut y_{10}=8, then after a_{10}, y_{11}=9.\n\nNow, to have y_{10}=9, I would need to be at y=9 at t=10, but to be at y=9, I need to come from y=8 or 9.\n\nBut y=8 at earliest t=10, so y=9 at earliest t=11.\n\nThus, minimal to reach y=9 is at turn 11, with 10 actions.\n\nH=10.\n\nBut let me see if I can be faster using other rows.\n\nFor example, at t=2, I am at y=0.\n\nInstead of going directly up, I could go to a higher row directly? But I can only move to adjacent rows, since delta y= -1,0,1.\n\nSo I have to go through each row sequentially, cannot jump.\n\nUnless I stay or move down, but that would take more time, not less.\n\nSo H=10 is minimal.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I can go up directly once past t=2.\n\nBut at t=2, I am at y=0.\n\nThen I need to go to y=1 at some point.\n\nSince rows 6 and 7 are always safe, but I still need to pass through lower rows to reach them, or not? No, I can go directly, but from y=0, I can only go to y=1 or stay, cannot jump to y=6.\n\nSo I must go through the rows.\n\nPerhaps I can stay at y=0 longer, but that would make H larger, not smaller.\n\nOr move down, but useless.\n\nSo best is to start moving up immediately after t=2.\n\nNow, in the sequence, a_1 must be such that y_2=0, so a_1 = S or D.\n\nThen at t=2, y_2=0, perform a_2=U, go to y_3=1.\n\nThen a_3=U, y_4=2\n\n...\n\nContinue to a_8=U, y_9=7? Let's list the actions and positions.\n\nTurn t | action a_t | position after action, y_{t+1}? Better to list position at turn t.\n\nAt turn t: position y_t\n\nAction a_t determines y_{t+1}\n\nFor collision, at turn t, we check based on y_t and time t.\n\nIn the sequence, we need actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1}, so a_1 to a_H for H actions, and after last action, at turn t=1+H, y_{1+H}=9.\n\nNow, positions:\n\nt=1: y_1=0\n\na_1: must be S or D, so y_2=0\n\nt=2: y_2=0\n\na_2: U, so y_3=1\n\nt=3: y_3=1\n\na_3: U, y_4=2\n\nt=4: y_4=2\n\na_4: U, y_5=3\n\nt=5: y_5=3\n\na_5: U, y_6=4\n\nt=6: y_6=4\n\na_6: U, y_7=5\n\nt=7: y_7=5\n\na_7: U, y_8=6\n\nt=8: y_8=6\n\na_8: U, y_9=7\n\nt=9: y_9=7\n\na_9: U, y_{10}=8\n\nt=10: y_{10}=8\n\nNow, to reach y=9, I need a_{10}: U, so y_{11}=9\n\nThen at t=11, y_{11}=9.\n\nSo H=10 actions: a_1 to a_{10}\n\nThe actions: a_1 to a_{10}, with a_1=S or D, a_2 to a_{10} all U? a_2 to a_9 are U, but a_{10} is also U to go to 9.\n\nIn the sequence, a_1: S or D, then a_2 to a_{10}: all U.\n\nBut a_{10} is the 10th action.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to specify the actions.\n\na_1 must be S or D, both result in y_2=0, so I can choose either, say S for simplicity.\n\nThen a_2=U, a_3=U, ..., up to a_{10}=U.\n\na_2 to a_{10} is 9 actions, all U, but I need 10 actions including a_1.\n\nActions: a_1, a_2, ..., a_{10}\n\na_1: S\n\na_2: U\n\na_3: U\n\na_4: U\n\na_5: U\n\na_6: U\n\na_7: U\n\na_8: U\n\na_9: U\n\na_{10}: U\n\nThen positions:\n\nAfter a_1 (S): y_2=0\n\nAfter a_2 (U): y_3=1\n\nAfter a_3 (U): y_4=2\n\n...\n\nAfter a_9 (U): y_{10}=8\n\nAfter a_{10} (U): y_{11}=9\n\nAt turn t=11, y_{11}=9.\n\nH=10.\n\nIn the sequence, a_1 to a_{10}, with t from t_1=1 to t_1 + H -1 = 1 + 10 -1 =10.\n\nActions for turns t=1 to t=10.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1}, etc.\n\nSo Turn 1: a_1 (S)\n\nTurn 2: a_2 (U)\n\n...\n\nTurn 10: a_{10} (U)\n\nBut at turn 10, I perform a_{10}, and after that, at turn 11, I am at y=9.\n\nThe problem says \"reach (0,9)\", and \"after a sequence of actions, position should be (0,9)\".\n\nIn the turn, when I am at (0,9), it is after the actions.\n\nIn the sequence, after H actions, at turn t=1+H, I should be at (0,9).\n\nHere with H=10, at t=11.\n\nBut is there a way with H=9?\n\nSuppose at some point I move faster, but I can't.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=6 or 7 earlier, but from y=0, I can only go to y=1 first.\n\nUnless at t=2, since y=6 and7 are safe, but to be on y=6 at t=2, I need to be there, but from y=0 at t=1, I can only go to y=0 or1 at t=2.\n\nCannot jump to y=6.\n\nSo impossible to be on higher rows earlier.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 10.\n\nIn the sequence, I used all U after the first stay.\n\nBut I could have moved up later, but that would take more time.\n\nSo this should be minimal.\n\nIn the actions, a_1 can be S or D, I choose S.\n\nThen a_2 to a_{10} all U.\n\nBut a_{10} is to go from y_{10}=8 to y_{11}=9.\n\nIn the turn, at turn t=10, I am at y=8, and I perform U to go to 9.\n\nNow, about the freeways: when I am on y=1 to 8 at t>=3, all are safe, as we established.\n\nFor example, at t=3, on y=1, which is safe since unsafe only at t=2.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=1, but t=1 is past.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the sequence should work.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nH=10, actions from a_1 to a_{10}.\n\nIn the boxed answer.\n\nBut let me write the actions for each turn.\n\nTurn 1: S  (since a_1=S)\n\nTurn 2: U  (a_2)\n\nTurn 3: U\n\nTurn 4: U\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nIn the sequence, from turn t=1 to t=10.\n\nAfter turn 10 action, at turn 11, position (0,9).\n\nThe problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", let's see.\n\nIn the task: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nt_1=1, so t from 0 to H-1, so a_{1+0} to a_{1+H-1}, that is a_1 to a_{1+H-1}.\n\nAfter H actions, the position should be (0,9).\n\nAfter a_{1+H-1}, at turn (1+H-1) +1 = 1+H, position y_{1+H}.\n\nSet y_{1+H}=9.\n\nIn terms of indices: actions a_k for k=1 to 1+H-1, so H actions.\n\nAfter, at turn (1+H-1) +1 = 1+H, y_{1+H}=9.\n\nIn my sequence, with H=10, actions a_1 to a_{10}, since 1+H-1=10 when H=10, so a_1 to a_{10}.\n\nThen at turn 11, y_{11}=9.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the answer, I need to list the turns.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nWith t_1=1.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 1: S\nTurn 2: U\nTurn 3: U\nTurn 4: U\nTurn 5: U\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: U\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\n\nBut Turn 10 is t_1 + 9, since t_1=1, t_1+9=10.\n\nH=10, so t from 0 to 9, t_1 + t for t=0 to 9.\n\nt=0: t_1 +0 =1, a_1\n\nt=1: t_1 +1=2, a_2\n\n...\n\nt=9: t_1 +9=10, a_{10}\n\nYes.\n\nAnd actions as above.\n\nIn the sequence, I have 10 actions, but the last U brings me to y=9.\n\nNow, I think that's fine.\n\nBut let me confirm if all is safe.\n\nAt t=1: on y=0, safe.\n\nAction a_1=S, y_2=0\n\nt=2: on y=0, safe (since not freeway, or freeway starts from 1)\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no cars, so always safe.\n\nAt t=2, y=0, safe.\n\na_2=U, y_3=1\n\nt=3: on y=1, now check: y=1 unsafe only at t=2, t=3>=3, safe.\n\nSimilarly, t=4: y=2, safe\n\n...\n\nt=10: y=8, now y=8 unsafe only at t=1, t=10>1, safe.\n\nThen a_{10}=U, y_{11}=9, goal.\n\nAll good.\n\nI could have a_1=D, but same as S, since y=0.\n\nSo S is fine.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=10.\n\nBut the problem is to output the sequence.\n\nIn the answer, I need to specify the actions.\n\nNow, in the car state, for freeway 8, there was a car unsafe at t=1, but we didn't go there at t=1, so fine.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nI think that's all.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 1\\) and must reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Movements and Safe Times\nThe cars on each freeway move according to their direction and speed. Collision occurs at turn \\(T\\) if the player is on freeway \\(y_T\\) and any car on that freeway has a span that includes \\(x = 0\\) at turn \\(T\\). The safe times for each freeway (when no car covers \\(x = 0\\)) are derived from the initial car states at turn 1:\n\n- **Freeway 1**: Unsafe only at \\(T = 2\\). Safe for \\(T \\neq 2\\).\n- **Freeway 2**: Identical to Freeway 1, unsafe only at \\(T = 2\\).\n- **Freeway 3**: Unsafe only at \\(T = 2\\).\n- **Freeway 4**: Identical to Freeway 3, unsafe only at \\(T = 2\\).\n- **Freeway 5**: Identical to Freeway 3, unsafe only at \\(T = 2\\).\n- **Freeway 6**: Always safe (no car covers \\(x = 0\\) at any turn).\n- **Freeway 7**: Always safe.\n- **Freeway 8**: Unsafe only at \\(T = 1\\). Safe for \\(T \\neq 1\\).\n\nFor turns \\(T \\geq 3\\), all freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) are safe at all times, as the unsafe events only occur at \\(T = 1\\) or \\(T = 2\\).\n\n### Path Planning\n- At turn \\(t = 1\\), the player is at \\(y = 0\\) (safe, no cars). Moving up to \\(y = 1\\) at turn \\(t = 2\\) would cause a collision, as \\(y = 1\\) is unsafe at \\(T = 2\\). Thus, the only safe action is to stay or move down, both resulting in \\(y_2 = 0\\).\n- At turn \\(t = 2\\), the player is at \\(y = 0\\) (safe). Since all freeways are safe for \\(t \\geq 3\\), the player can move up directly to \\(y = 9\\) without further delays.\n- The minimal path requires moving up one row per turn starting from turn 2. However, due to the initial delay at turn 1, the player cannot reach \\(y = 9\\) before turn 11.\n\n#### Position and Action Sequence\n- **Turn 1 (\\(t = 1\\))**: Position \\(y_1 = 0\\). Action \\(a_1 = S\\) (stay, \\(y_2 = 0\\)) to avoid moving to an unsafe row at \\(t = 2\\).\n- **Turn 2 (\\(t = 2\\))**: Position \\(y_2 = 0\\). Action \\(a_2 = U\\) (up, \\(y_3 = 1\\)). Now \\(t = 3 \\geq 3\\), so all rows are safe.\n- **Turn 3 (\\(t = 3\\))**: Position \\(y_3 = 1\\). Action \\(a_3 = U\\) (\\(y_4 = 2\\)).\n- **Turn 4 (\\(t = 4\\))**: Position \\(y_4 = 2\\). Action \\(a_4 = U\\) (\\(y_5 = 3\\)).\n- **Turn 5 (\\(t = 5\\))**: Position \\(y_5 = 3\\). Action \\(a_5 = U\\) (\\(y_6 = 4\\)).\n- **Turn 6 (\\(t = 6\\))**: Position \\(y_6 = 4\\). Action \\(a_6 = U\\) (\\(y_7 = 5\\)).\n- **Turn 7 (\\(t = 7\\))**: Position \\(y_7 = 5\\). Action \\(a_7 = U\\) (\\(y_8 = 6\\)).\n- **Turn 8 (\\(t = 8\\))**: Position \\(y_8 = 6\\). Action \\(a_8 = U\\) (\\(y_9 = 7\\)).\n- **Turn 9 (\\(t = 9\\))**: Position \\(y_9 = 7\\). Action \\(a_9 = U\\) (\\(y_{10} = 8\\)).\n- **Turn 10 (\\(t = 10\\))**: Position \\(y_{10} = 8\\). Action \\(a_{10} = U\\) (\\(y_{11} = 9\\)).\n\nAfter 10 actions, at turn \\(11\\) (\\(t_1 + H = 1 + 10 = 11\\)), the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\). The minimal \\(H\\) is 10, as fewer actions cannot achieve the goal due to the unavoidable delay at turn 1 and the need to increase \\(y\\) by 9 units with a maximum increase of 1 per action.\n\n### Final Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions \\(\\{a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} = \\{a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_{10}\\}\\) is:\n\n- \\(a_1 = S\\) (stay at turn 1 to avoid collision)\n- \\(a_2\\) to \\(a_{10} = U\\) (move up directly once safe)\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 1: S \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 2: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 3: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 4: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 5: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to 8. The player moves vertically, and cars move horizontally on their freeways. Collision happens if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at that turn.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at each future turn, so I can avoid being on a freeway when a car is crossing x=0.\n\nThe current turn is t_1 = 2. Player is at (0,0). I need to reach (0,9), so y=9.\n\nThe actions are U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), S (stay, y same). y is always between 0 and 9, inclusive.\n\nSince we start at y=0 and need to go to y=9, and we can only change y by -1,0,1 each turn, the minimum number of turns to go from 0 to 9 is 9, if we move up every turn. But we might need to wait or go down to avoid cars, so it could take more turns.\n\nBut we need the minimal H, so probably 9 is possible unless cars block us.\n\nNow, let's look at the car states for each freeway.\n\nFreeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nFor each freeway, there are cars with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: left or right.\n\nSpeed is given, but in the span update, for left-moving, the car moves left, so the span decreases in x? Let's see the notation.\n\nFor left-moving: at turn t_1, span is [h, τ]. Since it's left-moving, h and τ are positions, and as time increases, the car moves left, so the span shifts left.\n\nIn the update: for left-moving, Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]? Let's read carefully.\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn the description, for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h], which might imply that τ is the tail and h is the head, but for consistency, let's see.\n\nIn left-moving, it's [h, τ], and h and τ are positions, with h probably the head, τ the tail.\n\nBut for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h], which might be [tail, head] since it's moving right, so tail is left, head is right.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's think in terms of the position.\n\nA car has a span at time t, which is a interval [x_min, x_max] or something.\n\nFor collision, we care when 0 is in the span at turn T for the freeway we are on.\n\nTurn T is discrete, I think.\n\nt_1 is current turn, T is future turn.\n\nFor each freeway, I need to find for which turns T, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\nThen, when the player is on that freeway at turn T, collision occurs.\n\nPlayer position y_t is updated after action, so at turn t, after action, we are at y_t, and collision is checked based on that.\n\nLet's see the dynamics.\n\n\"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\"\n\nAnd Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo, at turn t, we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen, at turn t+1, we are at position (0, y_{t+1}), and collision is checked if for the freeway y_{t+1}, at turn t+1, 0 is in some car's span.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nLet's parse this.\n\nSuppose at turn T, you are on freeway y_T.\n\nYou choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nIf you move to a different freeway, y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, then at turn T, you are still on y_T, so collision is only checked for freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nAt turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, so collision checked for y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe note says: if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, then at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1}, so even if cars on y_{T+1} have 0 in span at T, it doesn't affect you because you're not there yet.\n\nAnd at T+1, you are on y_{T+1}, so if 0 in span at T+1, you collide.\n\nBut if at T, 0 in span for y_{T+1}, but at T+1 not, and you move at T, you don't collide because you arrive at T+1.\n\nSimilarly, when you leave a freeway, if you move away at turn T, you are not on it at T, so if car comes at T but you left, no collision.\n\nThe key point is that collision is checked only at the turn when you are on the freeway, based on the car positions at that exact turn.\n\nFor the player, at turn t, position is y_t, and collision if for freeway y_t, at turn t, 0 in some car's span.\n\ny_t is set after the action at t-1? Let's see the indices.\n\nStart at turn t_1, position (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,0)\n\nThen, for each turn, we choose action a_t for t from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1? The sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so actions from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1.\n\nAfter H actions, we have y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nDefine the turns.\n\nAt turn t_1, player is at y_{t_1} = 0.\n\nWe choose action a_{t_1}, which determines y_{t_1 + 1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{a_{t_1}}\n\nThen at turn t_1 + 1, position is (0, y_{t_1 + 1}), and collision check for freeway y_{t_1 + 1} at turn t_1 + 1.\n\nSimilarly, we choose a_{t_1 + 1}, get y_{t_1 + 2}, and so on, up to when y_{t_1 + H} = 9 for some H.\n\nThe position after H actions is y_{t_1 + H}, and we want y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nThe number of turns H is the number of actions, so after H actions, we are at turn t_1 + H, position y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nWe start at turn t_1, position y_{t_1}, and after first action, at turn t_1 +1, position y_{t_1 +1}, etc.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t_1 + k, position y_{t_1 + k}.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} = 9 for some H.\n\nMinimal H such that we can achieve that without collision.\n\nCollision occurs if at any turn t from t_1 +1 to t_1 + H, when we are at y_t, and for freeway y_t at turn t, 0 is in some car's span.\n\nAt turn t_1, we are at y_t1, but no action yet, and we don't check collision at start, I think. The collision is when we are on the freeway after moving.\n\nThe problem says: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nFor T = t_1, we are at y_{t_1} = 0, which is not a freeway, y=0 is not a freeway, freeways are y=1 to 8, I think.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nIn the grid, vertical axis y=0,1,2,...,9, freeways with cars are y=1 to 8.\n\nSo y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so no collision possible there.\n\nAt turn t_1, we are at (0,0), which is safe.\n\nThen we move to some y, and from turn t_1 +1 onwards, we are on some y, which could be freeway or y=9.\n\nWhen we reach y=9, we are done, and no collision there.\n\nSo collision only possible when on y=1 to 8.\n\nNow, back to the cars.\n\nCurrent turn t_1 = 2.\n\nFor each freeway, I need to find for which turns T, there is a car with 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nT is absolute turn number.\n\nSince t_1=2, let τ = T - t_1 = T - 2, the number of turns after current.\n\nThen for each car, span at T is based on t_1=2.\n\nFor a car on freeway i.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car: (-24, 11, left, 36)\n\nDirection left, so at t_1=2, span [h, τ] = [-24, 11]\n\nSince left-moving, at time T, span [h - s(T-2), τ - s(T-2)] = [-24 - 36(T-2), 11 - 36(T-2)]\n\n0 in span if -24 -36(T-2) ≤ 0 ≤ 11 -36(T-2)\n\nLet k = T - 2, so for k >=0, turns after.\n\n-24 -36k ≤ 0 ≤ 11 -36k\n\nFirst inequality: -24 -36k ≤ 0 => -36k ≤ 24 => multiply by -1, reverse inequality: 36k >= -24, which is always true since k>=0.\n\n-24 -36k <=0 is always true because both negative.\n\n-24 -36k <=0 for all k, since left side negative.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 11 -36k => 36k <= 11 => k <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305, so k=0 only since k integer.\n\nk=0, T=2.\n\nBut T=2 is current turn, and we are not on freeway 1 at turn 2, we are at y=0.\n\nAt turn T, if we were on freeway 1, but at T=2, we are at y=0, not on freeway.\n\nFor future turns, k>=1, T>=3.\n\nFor k>=1, 0 <= 11 -36k? 11-36k <= 11-36= -25 <0 for k>=1, so 0 <= negative false.\n\nThus, only possible for k=0, but T=2 not relevant.\n\nSo for freeway 1, 0 is never in span for T>2. So freeway 1 is always safe? But let's confirm.\n\nSpan at T: [-24 -36(T-2), 11 -36(T-2)]\n\nFor T=3, k=1: [-24-36, 11-36] = [-60, -25], both negative, 0 not in.\n\nT=4, [-24-72,11-72]=[-96,-61], etc., all left of 0, so never cross 0 for T>2. At T=2, it is [-24,11], which includes 0, but we are not on it.\n\nSo freeway 1 has no car crossing x=0 for T>2. So it's always safe to be on freeway 1 at any turn after 2.\n\nBut freeway 1 is y=1, but we might not need to be there, but it's safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? Cars: (-24,11,left,36) same as freeway 1.\n\nSo identical, always safe for T>2.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nDirection right, and span at t_1: [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? Let's see.\n\nFor right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so [tail, head], and at T, [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nSo for this car, τ = -59? Head and tail.\n\nIn the state, it says (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor right-moving: head and tail, with head > tail I assume.\n\nHere: (-48, -59, right, 12), so head = -48, tail = -59? But tail should be less than head for right-moving.\n\n-59 < -48, so tail = -59, head = -48.\n\nThen span at t_1: [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nAt time T, span [τ + s(T-2), h + s(T-2)] = [-59 + 12(T-2), -48 + 12(T-2)]\n\n0 in span if -59 +12(T-2) <= 0 <= -48 +12(T-2)\n\nLet k = T-2\n\n-59 +12k <= 0 <= -48 +12k\n\nFirst: -59 +12k <=0 => 12k <=59 => k <= 59/12 ≈ 4.916, so k<=4\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 +12k => 12k >=48 => k>=4\n\nSo for k=4, T=6\n\n-59 +12*4 = -59+48= -11 <=0, and 0 <= -48+48=0, so 0 <=0 true, so yes.\n\nFor k=4, 0 in span.\n\nFor other k? k=4 only since k>=4 and k<=4.\n\nk=4: -59+48= -11 <=0, 0<=0 true.\n\nk=3: -59+36= -23 <=0, but 0 <= -48+36= -12? 0 <= -12 false.\n\nk=5: -59+60=1 <=0? 1<=0 false, so no.\n\nSo only at T=6, 0 in span for this car.\n\nBut there are multiple cars.\n\nSecond car on freeway 3: (36, 25, right, 12)\n\nHead=36, tail=25, direction right.\n\nSpan at t_1: [τ, h] = [25, 36]? τ and h.\n\nSince right-moving, tail is left, head right, so span [tail, head] = [25,36]\n\nAt T: [25 +12(T-2), 36 +12(T-2)]\n\n0 in [25+12k, 36+12k] for k=T-2.\n\n25+12k >0 for k>=0, since 25>0, so 0 not in [25+12k, 36+12k] for any k, as min is 25>0.\n\nSimilarly, third car: (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nHead=0, tail=-11, right.\n\nSpan at t_1: [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt T: [-11 +12(T-2), 0 +12(T-2)] = [-11 +12k, 12k]\n\n0 in span if -11+12k <=0 <=12k\n\nFirst: -11+12k <=0 => 12k<=11 => k<=11/12<1, so k=0\n\nSecond: 0<=12k always for k>=0\n\nk=0: -11 <=0 <=0, 0<=0 true, so at T=2, k=0.\n\nBut T=2, not future.\n\nFor k>=1, -11+12k >=1>0? For k=1, [-11+12, 12] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nk=0 only, but T=2 past.\n\nSo for freeway 3, only the first car has 0 in span at T=6.\n\nSo at turn T=6, if on freeway 3, collision possible.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nNow freeway 4: same cars as freeway 3? \"(-48, -59, right, 12), (36, 25, right, 12), (0, -11, right, 12)\" identical to freeway 3.\n\nSo same as freeway 3: at T=6, if on y=4, collision due to first car.\n\nFreeway 5: same as 3 and 4, so same, at T=6 collision if on y=5.\n\nNow freeway 6: one car: (60, 49, right, 6)\n\nHead=60, tail=49, right.\n\nSpan at t_1: [49, 60]? [tail, head] = [49,60]\n\nAt T: [49 +6(T-2), 60 +6(T-2)]\n\nBoth positive, min 49>0, so 0 never in span. Safe.\n\nFreeway 7: same as 6, (60,49,right,6), same, safe.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: (60,49,right,6) and (12,1,right,6)\n\nFirst car (60,49,right,6) same as above, safe, never at 0.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,6)\n\nHead=12, tail=1, right.\n\nSpan at t_1: [1,12]? [tail,head]=[1,12]\n\nAt T: [1 +6(T-2), 12 +6(T-2)]\n\nFor k=T-2, [1+6k, 12+6k]\n\n0 in span? 1+6k >0 for k>=0, min=1>0, so 0 not in, safe.\n\nThus, only freeways 3,4,5 have a danger at T=6.\n\nSpecifically, at turn T=6, if on y=3,4, or 5, collision because of the car that has 0 in span.\n\nOtherwise, all other freeways and other times are safe.\n\ny=1,2,6,7,8 are always safe, as we saw.\n\ny=3,4,5 are safe except at T=6.\n\nNow, we need to go from y=0 at t=2 to y=9 at some turn.\n\nStart at turn 2, y=0.\n\nAfter actions, we move to y at turn 3,4,etc.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 safe, and we need to cross freeways 1 to 8.\n\nThe minimal path would be to go up as fast as possible, but we need to avoid being on y=3,4,5 at turn 6.\n\nTurn 6 is absolute turn.\n\nt_1=2, so turn 6 is T=6, which is k=4, T=t_1 +4.\n\nNow, let's list the turns: let t be absolute turn.\n\nStart: turn 2, y=0.\n\nAfter action a_2, at turn 3, y_3 = y_2 + Δy_2 = 0 + Δy_2\n\nSimilarly, a_3 for turn 3, y_4 = y_3 + Δy_3, and so on.\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + H} =9, so at turn 2+H, y=9.\n\nH is number of actions.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 2+H, y=9.\n\nThe position sequence: at turn 2, y=0 (before any action)\n\nAfter action at turn 2 (a_2), at turn 3, y_3\n\nAfter action at turn 3 (a_3), at turn 4, y_4\n\n...\n\nAfter action at turn 2+H-1, at turn 2+H, y_{2+H}\n\nSet y_{2+H} =9.\n\nCollision check at turns 3,4,5,...,2+H when y_t !=0 and !=9? y_t from 1 to 8.\n\nFor t from 3 to 2+H, if y_t between 1 and 8, need no car at 0 on that freeway at turn t.\n\nWe need to avoid y_t =3,4, or 5 when t=6.\n\nFor other times and other freeways, safe.\n\nMinimal H: since from y=0 to y=9, minimum 9 moves up, so H=9, arriving at turn 2+9=11.\n\nBut we might need to wait or detour to avoid t=6 on y=3,4,5.\n\nFirst, let's see if we can go directly in 9 turns.\n\nStart turn 2, y=0\n\nAction a_2: U, then turn 3, y=1\n\na_3: U, turn 4, y=2\n\na_4: U, turn 5, y=3\n\nBut turn 5, y=3, t=5, not 6, so safe? At t=5, freeway 3, is there car at 0?\n\nFor freeway 3, we have cars, but at t=5, k=3, T=5.\n\nFor the first car, span [-59 +12(5-2), -48 +12(3)] = [-59+36, -48+36] = [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nOther cars not near 0, so safe.\n\na_5: U, turn 6, y=4\n\nBut turn 6, y=4, which is freeway 4, and at t=6, we have collision on y=4 because of the car.\n\nFreeway 4 has car at 0 at t=6.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=3 or y=5 at t=6, same.\n\nIn this sequence, at turn 6, y=4, collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf we go slower or faster.\n\nSuppose we start by staying or something.\n\nWe need to not be on y=3,4,5 at turn 6.\n\nTurn 6 is t=6.\n\nt=6 corresponds to after 4 actions? Let's see.\n\nTurn 2: start, no action yet? After action at turn t, we move to turn t+1.\n\nAt turn 2, before action, y=0.\n\nChoose a_2, then at turn 3, y=y_3.\n\nSimilarly, choose a_3, at turn 4, y_4, and so on.\n\nSo after choosing a_t, we are at turn t+1 at y_{t+1}.\n\nThe collision turn is when we are at y_t for t from 3 to 2+H.\n\nt=6 is one such turn.\n\nWe need y_6 not in {3,4,5}.\n\ny_6 is the position at turn 6.\n\nTurn 6: y_6.\n\nIf y_6 is not 3,4, or 5, then no problem at t=6.\n\nOther times are safe.\n\nNow, we need to reach y=9 at turn 2+H.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nSince we start at y=0, turn 2.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn 2+k, y_{2+k}.\n\nWe need y_{2+H} =9.\n\nAnd for t from 3 to 2+H, if y_t in 1-8, no collision, which except for t=6 and y_t in {3,4,5}, all other cases are safe.\n\nNow, to minimize H, we should go up as fast as possible, but avoid being at y=3,4,5 at t=6.\n\nt=6 is fixed.\n\nWhat is y at turn 6.\n\nTurn 6: after actions from turn 2 to 5.\n\nActions: a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5 determine y_6.\n\ny_3 = 0 + Δy_2\n\ny_4 = y_3 + Δy_3\n\ny_5 = y_4 + Δy_4\n\ny_6 = y_5 + Δy_5\n\nEach Δy is -1,0,1 depending on action.\n\nWe start y_2=0.\n\nAfter a_2, y_3 = Δy_2\n\nThen y_4 = y_3 + Δy_3\n\ny_5 = y_4 + Δy_4\n\ny_6 = y_5 + Δy_5\n\nWe need y_6 not 3,4,5.\n\nAnd finally y_{2+H} =9.\n\nThe minimal H to reach 9 is 9, but we might need extra actions.\n\nSince y changes by at most 1 per turn, the position y_t depends on the actions.\n\nWe need to set y_6 such that it is not in {3,4,5}, so y_6 <=2 or y_6 >=6.\n\nThen from there, go to 9.\n\nBut y_6 must be between 0 and 9.\n\nNow, at turn 6, y_6 could be from 0 to 9, but since we start from 0, and move, by turn 6, we can be up to y=4 if all up, or less.\n\nTurn 2: y=0\n\nAfter a_2: turn 3, y<=1\n\na_3: turn 4, y<=2\n\na_4: turn 5, y<=3\n\na_5: turn 6, y<=4\n\nIf all up, y_3=1, y_4=2, y_5=3, y_6=4.\n\nBut y_6=4 is bad at t=6.\n\nIf we do less up, y_6 could be lower.\n\nIf we go down, but we need to go up eventually.\n\ny_6 could be higher if we move faster, but we can only move up one per turn, so maximum at turn 6 is y=4, since from turn 2 to turn 6, 4 moves? Let's count the turns.\n\nFrom turn 2 to turn 3: one action, y from 0 to at most 1.\n\nTurn 2 to 3: one step, y_3 = 0 or 1? y_3 can be 0 (S), 1 (U), or -1 but y>=0, so min 0.\n\ny_3 = 0 + Δy_2, Δy_2 = -1,0,1, but y>=0, so if Δy_2 = D, y_3= max(0, -1)=0, since y=0, cannot go down, I think.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and y_{t+1} must be in [0,9], so if at boundary, cannot move beyond.\n\nAt y=0, if a_t = D, y_{t+1} =0, similarly at y=9, if U, y_{t+1}=9.\n\nIn this case, start y=0, so y_3 = 0 if a_2=S or D, or 1 if a_2=U.\n\nSimilarly, y_4 = y_3 + Δy_3, and so on.\n\nNow, from turn 2 to turn 6: we have actions a_2 to a_5, which determine y_3 to y_6.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nAfter a_2: y_3\n\nAfter a_3: y_4\n\nAfter a_4: y_5\n\nAfter a_5: y_6\n\ny_3 to y_6 are set.\n\nEach can be from 0 to 9, but with constraints.\n\nSince we start low, and need to go up, but for now.\n\ny_6 must be not 3,4,5, so y_6 <=2 or y_6 >=6.\n\nBut what is possible?\n\nIf all actions up: a_2=U, y_3=1\n\na_3=U, y_4=2\n\na_4=U, y_5=3\n\na_5=U, y_6=4\n\ny_6=4, which is bad.\n\nIf we do S or D at some point, y_6 could be less.\n\nFor example, if a_2=S, y_3=0\n\na_3=U, y_4=1\n\na_4=U, y_5=2\n\na_5=U, y_6=3\n\ny_6=3, bad.\n\nIf a_2=U, y_3=1\n\na_3=S, y_4=1\n\na_4=U, y_5=2\n\na_5=U, y_6=3, bad.\n\na_2=U, y_3=1\n\na_3=U, y_4=2\n\na_4=S, y_5=2\n\na_5=U, y_6=3, bad.\n\na_2=U, y_3=1\n\na_3=U, y_4=2\n\na_4=U, y_5=3\n\na_5=S, y_6=3, bad.\n\nAll combinations with three or four U result in y_6=3 or 4, both bad.\n\nWith two U: for example a_2=S, y_3=0\n\na_3=S, y_4=0\n\na_4=U, y_5=1\n\na_5=U, y_6=2\n\ny_6=2, which is <=2, good.\n\nOr a_2=U, y_3=1\n\na_3=S, y_4=1\n\na_4=S, y_5=1\n\na_5=U, y_6=2\n\ny_6=2, good.\n\nOr a_2=D, but y=0, so D same as S, y_3=0\n\nThen a_3=D, y_4=0, etc., but y_6 could be 0,1,2.\n\nAll less than or equal to 2.\n\ny_6=2 is possible.\n\nBut y_6=6 or more? Not possible since from start, after 4 actions (a_2 to a_5), we can be at most y=4, as above.\n\nWith all U, y_6=4.\n\nCannot be higher than 4 at turn 6.\n\nSimilarly, minimum y_6=0 if all S or D.\n\nSo y_6 can be 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nBut 3 and 4 are bad, so only y_6 <=2 is possible to avoid collision, so y_6=0,1, or 2.\n\nThen from there, we need to go to y=9.\n\nFrom y_6 <=2, to y=9, we need at least 7 more moves up (since 9-2=7), but with possible S or D, but to minimize, we should go up.\n\nAfter y_6, we have actions a_6 to a_{2+H-1}, and at turn 2+H, y=9.\n\nThe number of actions from a_6 onwards.\n\nAt turn 6, y_6 <=2.\n\nThen we need to reach y=9.\n\nEach up move increases y by 1, so minimum 7 up moves to go from y<=2 to 9.\n\nBut we might have extra actions if we stay or go down, but that increases H, so minimal is to go straight up.\n\nNow, the turn when we arrive at y=9.\n\ny_6 at turn 6.\n\nThen after m actions, at turn 6+m, y_{6+m}\n\nSet y_{6+m} =9.\n\nSince y_6 <=2, y_{6+m} <=2 + m, so to have 2+m >=9, m>=7.\n\nThus minimal m=7, with all U, y_{6+m} = y_6 + m.\n\nSo if y_6=2, y_{13} =2+7=9 at turn 13.\n\nIf y_6=1, y_{13}=1+7=8, not 9, so need more.\n\ny_{6+m} = y_6 + number of U in the m actions.\n\nTo reach 9, we need y_6 + number of U >=9, but since we can stay, but to minimize actions, we should not stay, only U or necessary.\n\nMinimal actions: we need to increase from y_6 to 9, so at least 9 - y_6 up moves.\n\nWith no down or stay, exactly 9 - y_6 actions to go from y_6 to 9.\n\nThen at turn 6 + (9 - y_6), y=9.\n\nNow H total: from start to end.\n\nActions from a_2 to a_{2+H-1}, after H actions, at turn 2+H.\n\nAt turn 6, we have performed actions a_2 to a_5, so 4 actions, at turn 6.\n\nThen after additional actions a_6 to a_{2+H-1}, but let's index.\n\nAfter action a_k, at turn k+1.\n\nAfter a_2, turn 3; after a_3, turn 4; ... after a_5, turn 6.\n\nThen after a_6, turn 7; after a_7, turn 8; ... after a_{2+H-1}, turn 2+H.\n\nAt turn 6, after a_5, y_6.\n\nThen we need to go to y=9 at turn 2+H.\n\nThe actions from a_6 to a_{2+H-1} are for turns 7 to 2+H.\n\nNumber of actions from a_6 to a_{2+H-1} is (2+H-1) - 6 + 1? Let's see.\n\na_6 is the 5th action? Actions: a_2 (first), a_3 (second), a_4 (third), a_5 (fourth), a_6 (fifth), etc.\n\nAfter fourth action (a_5), at turn 6.\n\nAfter the H-th action, at turn 2+H.\n\nThe actions after turn 6 are a_6, a_7, ..., up to a_{2+H-1}, which correspond to moves to turn 7,8,...,2+H.\n\nNumber of such actions: from a_6 to a_{2+H-1}, that's (2+H-1) - 6 + 1 = H + 2 -1 -6 +1 = H -4.\n\nIndices: a_6 to a_k, number is k - 6 +1.\n\nSet k = 2+H-1, so number of actions from a_6 to a_{2+H-1} is (2+H-1) - 6 +1 = 2+H-1-6+1 = H -4.\n\nAfter these actions, at turn 2+H, y_{2+H} = y_6 + sum of Δy from a_6 to a_{2+H-1}, but the actions affect the position.\n\ny_{2+H} = y_6 + Δy_6 + Δy_7 + ... + Δy_{2+H-1}\n\nΔy_t for t from 6 to 2+H-1.\n\nt from 6 to 2+H-1.\n\nNumber of terms: (2+H-1) - 6 +1 = H-4.\n\nSet y_{2+H} =9.\n\ny_{2+H} = y_6 + sum_{t=6}^{2+H-1} Δy_t\n\nEach Δy_t = -1,0,1.\n\nTo minimize H, we need to minimize the number of actions after turn 6.\n\nSince y_6 <=2, and y_{2+H} =9, the minimal number of up moves needed is 9 - y_6.\n\nWith no down or stay, we need exactly 9 - y_6 actions to increase y by 9 - y_6.\n\nThus, minimal number of actions after a_5 is 9 - y_6.\n\nThese actions are a_6 to a_{m}, where after a_m, turn m+1 = 2+H, so m+1=2+H, thus m=1+H.\n\nThe actions after a_5 are a_6 to a_{2+H-1}, and there are (2+H-1) - 6 +1 = H-4 actions.\n\nAfter these H-4 actions, y_{2+H} = y_6 + sum of Δy over those actions.\n\nSet y_{2+H} =9.\n\nThe increase is 9 - y_6.\n\nEach action can contribute at most +1 to increase, so we need at least 9 - y_6 actions to achieve an increase of 9 - y_6, meaning all must be U, no S or D.\n\nThus minimal number of actions after a_5 is exactly 9 - y_6, all U.\n\nThen, after that, at turn 6 + (9 - y_6) = 15 - y_6, y=9.\n\nNow, turn at y=9 is 15 - y_6.\n\nBut turn must be 2+H.\n\nAfter a_{2+H-1}, at turn 2+H.\n\nNow, from above, after a_5, at turn 6.\n\nThen after 9 - y_6 actions, all U, at turn 6 + (9 - y_6) = 15 - y_6.\n\nSet this to 2+H.\n\nThus 15 - y_6 = 2 + H\n\nSo H = 15 - y_6 - 2 = 13 - y_6\n\nSince y_6 <=2, H = 13 - y_6 >= 13 - 2 =11.\n\nIf y_6=2, H=11; if y_6=1, H=12; if y_6=0, H=13.\n\nTo minimize H, we want larger y_6, so y_6=2, then H=11.\n\nNow, with y_6=2.\n\nAnd actions all U after that.\n\nNow, we need to achieve y_6=2 with the first actions.\n\nNow, back to the first part.\n\nWe need y_6=2, and avoid collision at earlier turns, but since only t=6 is critical and y_6=2 not in {3,4,5}, and other freeways safe, so no issue.\n\nNow, with y_6=2, and H=11.\n\nTurn at end: 2+H=13, y=9.\n\nNow, sequence of actions.\n\nFrom turn 2 to turn 6: need y_6=2.\n\nStart y_2=0.\n\ny_3 = Δy_2\n\ny_4 = y_3 + Δy_3\n\ny_5 = y_4 + Δy_4\n\ny_6 = y_5 + Δy_5\n\nSet y_6=2.\n\nWe need to choose actions so that y_6=2.\n\nFor example, one way: a_2=U, y_3=1\n\na_3=U, y_4=2\n\na_4=S, y_5=2\n\na_5=S, y_6=2\n\nOr a_2=U, y_3=1\n\na_3=S, y_4=1\n\na_4=U, y_5=2\n\na_5=S, y_6=2\n\nMany possibilities.\n\nBut we also need to make sure no collision at turns 3,4,5,6.\n\nAt turn 6, y_6=2, which is freeway 2, but freeway 2 is always safe, as we saw earlier.\n\nAt turn 3,4,5: positions y_3,y_4,y_5.\n\nSince only t=6 is critical for y=3,4,5, but at t=3,4,5, if on y=3,4,5, no problem because only at t=6 there is danger.\n\nFor example, at t=5, y=3 is fine, as we saw earlier.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nThus, we can choose any sequence that gets y_6=2.\n\nThen from there, go straight up to 9.\n\nNow, minimal H=11, with y_6=2.\n\nIf y_6=1, H=12, worse; y_6=0, H=13, worse.\n\nSo H=11 is minimal.\n\nNow, sequence.\n\nLet's specify the actions.\n\nStart turn 2, y=0.\n\nWe need a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5 such that after a_5, y_6=2.\n\nFor example:\n\nOption: a_2 = U  // y_3 =1\n\na_3 = U  // y_4 =2\n\na_4 = S  // y_5 =2\n\na_5 = S  // y_6 =2\n\nThen from turn 6, y=2.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9 with 7 up moves? y_6=2, to y=9, need 7 up moves.\n\nAfter a_5, at turn 6, y=2.\n\nThen a_6 to a_{12}, all U, to reach turn 13, y=9.\n\nActions: a_6, a_7, a_8, a_9, a_10, a_11, a_12.\n\nAfter a_6, turn 7, y=3\n\na_7, turn 8, y=4\n\n...\n\nAfter a_12, turn 13, y=2 + 7?

if S, y_6=3, bad; if D, y_6=2, good.\n\nSo a_5=D, then y_6=2.\n\nThen same as before, but we used a down move, which might not be efficient, but in this case, y_6=2 still, and H same or worse.\n\nIn this sequence: a_2=U, y3=1\n\na_3=U, y4=2\n\na_4=U, y5=3\n\na_5=D, y6=2  // went down to avoid\n\nThen from there, need to go to 9, still 7 up moves, so H=11 same.\n\nBut we have an extra down move, which is wasted, but H same.\n\nIn terms of number, same H.\n\nBut in the first sequence, we didn't go down, we stayed.\n\nIn the sequence I have, with a_4=S and a_5=S, we stayed at y=2 for turns 5 and 6.\n\nNo down move.\n\nIn this alternative, we went to y=3 at turn 5, then down to y=2 at turn 6.\n\nBut turn 5 y=3 is fine, and we end up same.\n\nBut H is same.\n\nTo confirm, let's list the positions.\n\nFirst sequence:\n\nTurn 2: start y=0\n\na_2=U, turn 3 y=1\n\na_3=U, turn 4 y=2\n\na_4=S, turn 5 y=2  // action S at turn 4, so y5= y4 +0 =2\n\na_5=S, turn 6 y=2  // action S at turn 5, y6=2\n\nThen a_6=U, turn 7 y=3\n\na_7=U, turn 8 y=4\n\na_8=U, turn 9 y=5\n\na_9=U, turn 10 y=6\n\na_10=U, turn 11 y=7\n\na_11=U, turn 12 y=8\n\na_12=U, turn 13 y=9\n\nH=11 actions.\n\nAlternative with down:\n\na_2=U, turn 3 y=1\n\na_3=U, turn 4 y=2\n\na_4=U, turn 5 y=3  // now at turn 5, y=3, freeway 3, at t=5, safe\n\na_5=D, turn 6 y=2  // down to avoid\n\nThen same as above from turn 6.\n\nBut we have a down move, which is unnecessary, but H same.\n\nNow, in the first sequence, at turn 5, we are at y=2, which is fine.\n\nBut we could be at higher earlier, but not necessary.\n\nNow, another point: freeway 8 has a car at (12,1,right,6), but we saw it never at 0, so safe.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 12, y=8, freeway 8, at t=12.\n\nCheck if any car at 0.\n\nFreeway 8 cars: (60,49,right,6) and (12,1,right,6)\n\nAt turn T=12, k=T-2=10\n\nFirst car: [49 +6*10, 60+60] = [49+60,60+60]= [109,120], not 0.\n\nSecond car: [1 +6*10, 12+60] = [1+60,12+60]= [61,72], not 0.\n\nSafe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nNow, back to the action sequence.\n\nIn the answer, we need to list the actions.\n\nWith H=11.\n\nThe sequence I have: a_2=U, a_3=U, a_4=S, a_5=S, a_6=U, a_7=U, a_8=U, a_9=U, a_10=U, a_11=U, a_12=U\n\nIn terms of the output:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = U  // for turn 2\n\nTurn t_1 +1: a_{t_1 +1} = U  // turn 3\n\nTurn t_1 +2: a_{t_1 +2} = S  // turn 4\n\nTurn t_1 +3: a_{t_1 +3} = S  // turn 5\n\nTurn t_1 +4: a_{t_1 +4} = U  // turn 6\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 +10: a_{t_1 +10} = U  // turn 12\n\nt_1 + H -1 = 2 + 10 =12, since H-1=10.\n\nt from 0 to 10, 11 actions.\n\nTo write:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 2: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 3: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 4: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 5: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\end{array} }\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 6, action a_6=U, which is for turn 6, leading to y_7=3.\n\nIn the list, it should be clear.\n\nPerhaps we can have a sequence without stay, but with down, but H same.\n\nAnother sequence: to have y_6=2 with different actions.\n\nFor example, a_2=S, y3=0\n\na_3=U, y4=1\n\na_4=U, y5=2\n\na_5=S, y6=2\n\nThen a_6 to a_12 all U, same H.\n\nBut we started slower, y lower earlier, but no issue.\n\nIn this case, at turn 3, y=0, not freeway, safe.\n\nTurn 4 y=1, safe.\n\nEtc.\n\nBut in the first sequence, we are at y=1 and y=2 earlier.\n\nBut both fine.\n\nI think any is ok.\n\nIn the output, we need to specify the turn numbers.\n\nThe answer should be in the box.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 3,4,5, we have multiple cars, but only one causes issue at t=6.\n\nBut we handled.\n\nIs there a way to be at y=6 or higher at turn 6? But impossible, since max y=4 at turn 6.\n\nThus H=11 is minimal.\n\nSo the sequence.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 2\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined. The minimal \\(H\\) is 11, meaning the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 13 (since \\(t_1 + H = 2 + 11 = 13\\)).\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Collision Avoidance**: The only collision risk occurs at turn 6 (absolute turn) on freeways \\(y = 3, 4, 5\\) due to cars crossing \\(x = 0\\). All other freeways and times are safe.\n- **Strategy**: \n  - Achieve \\(y_6 = 2\\) at turn 6 to avoid being on \\(y = 3, 4, 5\\) at the critical turn.\n  - From turn 6 onwards, move up continuously to reach \\(y = 9\\) in 7 turns.\n- **Minimal \\(H\\)**: With \\(y_6 = 2\\), the minimal \\(H\\) is 11. If \\(y_6\\) were lower, \\(H\\) would increase, so \\(y_6 = 2\\) is optimal.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe actions are chosen as follows:\n- Turns 2 to 5: Reach \\(y_6 = 2\\) without collision. Specifically:\n  - Turn 2: Move up to \\(y_3 = 1\\) (safe, freeway 1 has no cars at \\(x=0\\) for \\(T > 2\\)).\n  - Turn 3: Move up to \\(y_4 = 2\\) (safe, freeway 2 has no cars at \\(x=0\\) for \\(T > 2\\)).\n  - Turn 4: Stay to keep \\(y_5 = 2\\) (safe, freeway 2 at turn 5 is not critical).\n  - Turn 5: Stay to keep \\(y_6 = 2\\) (safe, freeway 2 at turn 6 has no cars at \\(x=0\\)).\n- Turns 6 to 12: Move up continuously to reach \\(y_{13} = 9\\). All intermediate positions are safe:\n  - \\(y_7 = 3\\) at turn 7: Freeway 3 safe (critical only at turn 6).\n  - \\(y_8 = 4\\) at turn 8: Freeway 4 safe (critical only at turn 6).\n  - \\(y_9 = 5\\) at turn 9: Freeway 5 safe (critical only at turn 6).\n  - \\(y_{10} = 6\\) to \\(y_{12} = 8\\): Freeways 6, 7, 8 always safe.\n  - \\(y_{13} = 9\\): No cars, safe.\n\n### Answer:\nThe minimal \\(H\\) is 11, with the action sequence:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text{Turn } 2: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 3: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 4: S \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 5: S \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 6: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 7: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0,1) at turn t1 = 3. The goal is to reach (0,9) in the minimum number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. I need to find a sequence of actions: U (up), D (down), or S (stay), that moves the player vertically.\n\nThe player's y-position changes based on actions: U increases y by 1, D decreases y by 1, S keeps it the same. y must stay between 0 and 9, inclusive.\n\nCars are on freeways y=1 to y=8. Each freeway has cars with head, tail, direction, and speed. Collision occurs only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, the player's x=0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nImportant note: when the player moves to a new y-position, they are not on that freeway until the next turn. So, if at turn T, the player is at y_T, and they move to y_{T+1} at turn T+1, they are only on freeway y_T at turn T, and on y_{T+1} at turn T+1. So, for collision check at turn T, we only care about freeway y_T.\n\nThe car spans move over time. For left-moving cars (direction left), the span moves left: at time T, span is [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)] for a car that at t1 was [h, τ]. Similarly for right-moving, it moves right: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nIn the input, for left-moving, it's given as (head, tail, left, speed), and head is the front, I assume. For left-moving, head is to the left, I think, since it's moving left. Similarly for right-moving, head is to the right.\n\nLet me clarify the direction notation.\n\nFor freeway 1: cars: (-60, -25, left, 36)\n\nSince direction is left, and head is -60, tail is -25. Since it's moving left, the head is the leftmost point? No.\n\nTypically, for a car, head is the front. If moving left, front is left, so head should be smaller x, tail larger. But here, for left-moving, head is -60, tail is -25, and -60 < -25, so yes, head is smaller x, so left is smaller x.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, like freeway 3: (-36, -47, right, 12), but -36 > -47, so head is -36, tail is -47, which is smaller. If moving right, head should be larger x.\n\nInconsistency.\n\nFreeway 3: (-36, -47, right, 12)\n\n-47 is less than -36, so if head is -36 and tail is -47, that means tail is at x=-47, head at x=-36, so the car is from x=-47 to x=-36? But span [τ, h] with τ=-47, h=-36, so [ -47, -36 ]? But it says \"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" for right-moving, meaning τ to h, with h > τ for right-moving?\n\nIn the car update rules:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → moves left.\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → moves right.\n\nAnd in the state, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction, speed).\n\nSo for left-moving: (h, τ, left, s) with h and τ, and span [h, τ], so if moving left, h should be the left end, so smaller x.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (-60, -25, left, 36), so h=-60, τ=-25, span [-60, -25], moving left.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: (τ, h, right, s)? No, in freeway 3, it's (-36, -47, right, 12), but -36 and -47, if h is head, τ is tail, but for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h], so τ should be left, h right.\n\nHere τ=-47, h=-36, since -47 < -36, so τ=-47, h=-36, so span [τ, h] = [-47, -36], which is correct for moving right, since h > τ.\n\nSimilarly, other cars.\n\nIn the list, for freeway 3: (-36, -47, right, 12), but according to notation, it's (head, tail, direction), so head is -36, tail is -47, but for right-moving, span is [tail, head] = [-47, -36].\n\nSimilarly, (48, 37, right, 12): head=48, tail=37, so span [37,48]? But tail=37, head=48, so [tail, head] = [37,48].\n\nAnd (12,1, right,12): head=12, tail=1, span [1,12].\n\nBut tail=1, head=12, so [tail,head] = [1,12].\n\nNow, for freeway 4,5 same as 3? Freeway 4 and 5 have same cars as 3? No, let's see:\n\nFreeway 3: (-36, -47, right, 12), (48, 37, right, 12), (12, 1, right, 12)\n\nBut (48,37, right,12) – 48 and 37, 48>37, so head=48, tail=37, span [37,48].\n\nSimilarly, (12,1, right,12) head=12, tail=1, span [1,12].\n\nAnd (-36,-47, right,12) head=-36, tail=-47, span [-47,-36].\n\nSimilarly for freeway 4 and 5, identical.\n\nFreeway 6: (-48,-59, right,6) so head=-48, tail=-59? tail=-59, head=-48, so for right, span [tail,head] = [-59,-48].\n\nFreeway 7 same: (-48,-59, right,6)\n\nFreeway 8: (-48,-59, right,6), (18,7, right,6) so first car head=-48, tail=-59, span [-59,-48]; second car head=18, tail=7, span [7,18].\n\nNow, the player starts at (0,1) at turn t1=3. y=1, so on freeway 1 at turn 3.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nSince we start at y=1, and need to go up to y=9, we must move up at least 8 times, but we can stay or move down sometimes to avoid cars, but moving down might not help since we need to go up, and y=0 is bottom, but we start at y=1, so moving down to y=0 might be possible but not necessary, and since we need to go to 9, moving down might delay.\n\nThe minimal H should be at least 8, since we need 8 up moves to go from 1 to 9.\n\nBut with cars, we might need to stay or move down to avoid, so H could be more than 8.\n\nNow, collision occurs only if at turn T, player is at y_T, and x=0 is within the span of any car on freeway y_T at that turn.\n\nCars are moving, so we need to compute for each turn and each freeway when a car covers x=0.\n\nSince the spans are linear with time, we can find for each car when x=0 is covered.\n\nBut for a given freeway, multiple cars, so we need to know for each freeway and each turn if x=0 is occupied.\n\nSince time is discrete, turns, we can compute for each freeway the times when x=0 is covered by a car.\n\nThen for the player, when moving to y at turn T, we need that at turn T, on freeway y, x=0 is not covered.\n\nNow, let's denote t = 0 at turn t1, so relative time from start.\n\nSet τ = T - t1, so at τ=0, turn t1.\n\nPlayer position at time τ: y_τ, with y_0 =1.\n\nAction at each step.\n\nWe need y_H =9 for some H.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nFirst, let's list all freeways and their car situations.\n\nFreeway y=1: cars: one car with initial span [h,τ] = [-60,-25], left-moving, speed 36.\n\nSince left-moving, at time τ (relative to t1), span is [ -60 - 36τ, -25 - 36τ ]\n\nCollision at x=0 when 0 is in [ -60 -36τ, -25 -36τ ]\n\nSo -60 -36τ ≤ 0 ≤ -25 -36τ\n\nSince the car is moving left, the span is decreasing.\n\nSo 0 ≤ -25 -36τ? Let's solve inequalities.\n\nLeft: -60 -36τ ≤ 0 ⇒ -36τ ≤ 60 ⇒ τ ≥ -60/36 = -5/3 ≈ -1.666, but since τ ≥0, always true for τ≥0.\n\nRight: 0 ≤ -25 -36τ ⇒ 0 ≤ -25 -36τ ⇒ 25 ≤ -36τ? No, 0 ≤ -25 -36τ implies -36τ ≥ 25, so τ ≤ -25/36 ≈ -0.694, but τ≥0, impossible.\n\n0 ≤ -25 -36τ is impossible because -25 -36τ <0 for τ≥0.\n\nSo the inequality -60 -36τ ≤ 0 ≤ -25 -36τ cannot hold for τ≥0 because 0 ≤ -25 -36τ is false.\n\nThus, for freeway 1, x=0 is never covered for τ≥0. So freeway 1 is always safe.\n\nIs that right?\n\n-60 -36τ ≤ 0 is true for τ≥0 since -36τ≤0, -60<0.\n\nBut 0 ≤ -25 -36τ: since -25 -36τ ≤ -25 <0 for τ≥0, so 0 ≤ negative number, false. So indeed, 0 is never in the interval for τ≥0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, (-60,-25,left,36), so same thing, always safe.\n\nNow freeway 3: cars: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-36,-47,right,12) but as per notation, head=-36, tail=-47, direction right, so span at t1: [τ,h] = [-47,-36]? Earlier I said for right-moving, span is [tail, head] = [-47,-36]\n\nAt time τ, since moving right, span [ -47 + 12τ, -36 + 12τ ]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (48,37,right,12) head=48, tail=37, span [37,48] at t1, at τ: [37 + 12τ, 48 + 12τ]\n\nThird car: (12,1,right,12) head=12, tail=1, span [1,12] at t1, at τ: [1 + 12τ, 12 + 12τ]\n\nNow, collision at x=0 when 0 in any of these spans.\n\nFirst car: [ -47 +12τ, -36 +12τ ]\n\n0 in this: -47 +12τ ≤ 0 ≤ -36 +12τ\n\nLeft: -47 +12τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 12τ ≤ 47 ⇒ τ ≤ 47/12 ≈ 3.9167\n\nRight: 0 ≤ -36 +12τ ⇒ 36 ≤ 12τ ⇒ τ ≥ 3\n\nSo for τ between 3 and 3.9167, approximately. Since τ integer, τ=3? τ from 0.\n\nτ=3: left: -47 +12*3 = -47+36= -11 ≤0, right: -36+36=0, so 0 ≤ 0 is true, so at τ=3, 0 is in [-11,0]? [ -47+36, -36+36] = [-11, 0], and 0 is included, so yes, covered at τ=3.\n\nτ=4: [ -47+48, -36+48] = [1,12], 0 not in [1,12], so not covered.\n\nτ=3: covered.\n\nNow second car: [37 +12τ, 48 +12τ], since 37+12τ >0 for τ≥0, 0 not in, so never covered.\n\nThird car: [1 +12τ, 12 +12τ], all positive for τ≥0, 0 not in, never covered.\n\nSo for freeway 3, only covered at τ=3.\n\nτ=3: first car covers x=0.\n\nNow freeway 4: same as freeway 3, since cars identical, so also covered only at τ=3.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5: same, covered at τ=3.\n\nNow freeway 6: cars: one car (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nHead=-48, tail=-59, direction right, so span at t1: [τ,h] = [-59,-48]? Tail=-59, head=-48, so [tail, head] = [-59,-48]\n\nAt time τ: [ -59 + 6τ, -48 + 6τ ]\n\n0 in this: -59 +6τ ≤ 0 ≤ -48 +6τ\n\nLeft: -59 +6τ ≤ 0 ⇒ 6τ ≤ 59 ⇒ τ ≤ 59/6 ≈ 9.833\n\nRight: 0 ≤ -48 +6τ ⇒ 48 ≤ 6τ ⇒ τ ≥ 8\n\nSo for τ between 8 and 9.833, so τ=8,9.\n\nAt τ=8: [ -59+48, -48+48] = [-11, 0], 0 in, covered.\n\nτ=9: [ -59+54, -48+54] = [-5,6], 0 in, covered.\n\nτ=10: [ -59+60, -48+60] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo covered at τ=8 and 9.\n\nSimilarly freeway 7: same as 6, covered at τ=8 and 9.\n\nNow freeway 8: cars: (-48,-59,right,6) and (18,7,right,6)\n\nFirst car same as above: covered at τ=8,9.\n\nSecond car: (18,7,right,6) head=18, tail=7, span [7,18] at t1, at τ: [7 +6τ, 18 +6τ]\n\n0 in this? 7+6τ ≥7>0 for τ≥0, so never covered.\n\nSo for freeway 8, covered only when first car covers, at τ=8 and 9.\n\nNow summarize for each freeway, the times τ (relative to t1) when x=0 is covered, so unsafe to be on that freeway at that τ.\n\ny=1: always safe\n\ny=2: always safe (same as y=1)\n\ny=3: unsafe at τ=3\n\ny=4: unsafe at τ=3\n\ny=5: unsafe at τ=3\n\ny=6: unsafe at τ=8,9\n\ny=7: unsafe at τ=8,9\n\ny=8: unsafe at τ=8,9\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, no cars, so always safe. Player can be at y=0 or y=9 without issue.\n\nThe goal is (0,9), so y=9 is safe.\n\nPlayer starts at y=1 at τ=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some τ=H.\n\nActions: each turn, move U, D, or S.\n\ny changes by +1, -1, or 0, bounded to [0,9].\n\nSince we start at y=1 and need to go to y=9, net +8, so minimal actions: at least 8 U moves, and possibly S or D, but D would require extra U to compensate, so to minimize H, we should avoid D and minimize S, so ideally H=8 with all U.\n\nBut we have to avoid being on unsafe freeways at unsafe times.\n\nSo let's see if we can go directly up with all U.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=1 (safe, since y=1 always safe)\n\nAction U: to y=2 at τ=1? Let's see the timing.\n\nAt turn τ, player is at position y_τ.\n\nAction a_τ is taken at turn τ, which determines y_{τ+1}.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt the beginning of turn τ, player is at y_τ.\n\nThen action a_τ is chosen, which sets y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy, with Δy based on a_τ.\n\nThen at turn τ, the player is on freeway y_τ, and we check collision based on cars on y_τ at turn τ.\n\nThen after action, at turn τ+1, player is at y_{τ+1}, and so on.\n\nStart: τ=0, y_0 =1\n\nAction a_0, then y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\nAt turn τ, position y_τ, on freeway y_τ.\n\nFor τ=0: turn t1, y=1, freeway 1, which is safe.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nSuppose we do all U: a_τ = U for τ=0 to 7, then y_1=2, y_2=3, y_3=4, y_4=5, y_5=6, y_6=7, y_7=8, y_8=9.\n\nAt τ=8, y=9, which is safe.\n\nNow, we need to check for each τ, when on freeway y_τ, if it is safe at that τ.\n\nAt τ=0: y=1, safe\n\nτ=1: y=2, which is always safe, as above\n\nτ=2: y=3, freeway 3. Is it safe at τ=2?\n\nFor y=3, unsafe at τ=3, but at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, for freeway 3: car spans at τ=2.\n\nFirst car: at τ, span [ -47 +12τ, -36 +12τ ]\n\nAt τ=2: [ -47+24, -36+24] = [-23, -12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [37+24,48+24]=[61,72], no\n\nThird car: [1+24,12+24]=[25,36], no\n\nSo at τ=2, freeway 3 safe.\n\nIn the sequence, at τ=2, y=3, so on freeway 3 at τ=2, which is safe.\n\nThen at τ=3, after action, y=4? In the sequence: at τ=2, y=3, action U, so y_3=4.\n\nAt turn τ=3, y_3=4.\n\nFreeway y=4 at τ=3.\n\ny=4 is unsafe at τ=3.\n\nFreeway 4 at τ=3: since same as freeway 3, covered at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, on y=4, collision.\n\nSo cannot be on y=4 at τ=3.\n\nIn this path, at τ=3, we are on y=4, which is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if we go up, at τ=3 we are on y=4 or something.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=3,4,5 at τ=3? y=3,4,5 all unsafe at τ=3.\n\nIn the all U sequence:\n\nτ=0: y=1, safe\n\nτ=1: y=2, safe\n\nτ=2: y=3, safe (since unsafe only at τ=3 for y=3)\n\nAt τ=2, y=3 is safe, as above.\n\nThen action at τ=2: U, so y_3=4\n\nAt τ=3: on y=4, which is unsafe at τ=3.\n\nCollision.\n\nSo we need to not be on y=4 at τ=3, or on any unsafe freeway at that time.\n\nSimilarly, later at τ=8 and 9, y=6,7,8 are unsafe.\n\nBut first, let's handle the τ=3 problem.\n\nWe need to be on a safe freeway at τ=3.\n\nSafe freeways at τ=3:\n\ny=1: always safe\n\ny=2: always safe\n\ny=3: unsafe at τ=3\n\ny=4: unsafe at τ=3\n\ny=5: unsafe at τ=3\n\ny=6: unsafe only at τ=8,9, so at τ=3 safe\n\nSimilarly y=7 safe at τ=3\n\ny=8 safe at τ=3\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nSo at τ=3, we can be on y=1,2,6,7,8,0,9.\n\nBut we start from y=1, and need to go to y=9.\n\nNow, at τ=0: y=1\n\nWe need to choose actions so that at τ=3, y_3 is one of the safe y.\n\ny_3 depends on actions from τ=0 to τ=2.\n\nFrom τ=0 to τ=2, three actions: a_0, a_1, a_2.\n\ny_0=1\n\nAfter a_0, y_1 = y_0 + Δy_0\n\nAfter a_1, y_2 = y_1 + Δy_1\n\nAfter a_2, y_3 = y_2 + Δy_2\n\nSo y_3 = 1 + Δy_0 + Δy_1 + Δy_2\n\nEach Δy is -1,0,1.\n\ny_3 must be between 0 and 9.\n\nPossible y_3: from 1-3 to 1+3, but min 0, max 9, but since start at 1, after 3 steps, y_3 from max 4 to min -2, but y>=0, so y_3 from 0 to 4.\n\ny_0=1\n\nAfter one step, y_1 in {0,1,2}\n\nAfter two steps, y_2 in {0,1,2,3}? From y_1=0, can go to 0,1; from y_1=1, to 0,1,2; from y_1=2, to 1,2,3. So y_2 in {0,1,2,3}\n\nSimilarly, y_3: from y_2=0, y_3=0,1; y_2=1, y_3=0,1,2; y_2=2, y_3=1,2,3; y_2=3, y_3=2,3,4. So y_3 in {0,1,2,3,4}\n\nAt τ=3, we need y_3 in safe set: {1,2,6,7,8,0,9} but y_3 can only be 0,1,2,3,4, so possible safe y_3: 0,1,2.\n\nSince 6,7,8,9 not reachable in 3 steps from y=1.\n\nIn 3 steps, max y=4, min y=0.\n\nSo at τ=3, safe y are 0,1,2.\n\ny=3 and 4 are unsafe.\n\nNow, y=2 is always safe, y=1 always safe, y=0 safe.\n\nSo we need y_3 to be 0,1, or 2.\n\nBut we need to go to y=9 eventually, so if we go to y=0 or stay low, it might take more turns.\n\nBut for now, to avoid collision at τ=3.\n\nIn the all U case, y_3=4, which is unsafe.\n\nSo we need to not go up too fast.\n\nFor example, we could stay or move down at some point to be lower at τ=3.\n\nSpecifically, y_3 <=2.\n\nSince y_0=1, to have y_3=2, we need net +1 in three steps, so one U and two S, or one U, one D, one S, etc., but since we want minimal H, we should not go down if possible.\n\ny_3=1: net zero, so actions: three S, or U and D and S, etc.\n\ny_3=0: net -1, one D and two S, etc.\n\nBut going down might not be efficient.\n\nAfter τ=3, we can go up.\n\nAlso, later there is problem at τ=8 and 9 with y=6,7,8 unsafe.\n\nBut first, let's handle τ=3.\n\nTo minimize H, we should be as high as possible at each step, but constrained by safety.\n\nAt τ=3, we can be at y=2, for example.\n\nThen from there, go up.\n\ny=2 at τ=3 is safe.\n\nNow, let's plan the path.\n\nStart: τ=0, y=1\n\nWe need y_3 <=2.\n\nPossible sequences:\n\nFor example, to be at y=2 at τ=3.\n\ny_3=2.\n\nThen from τ=0 to τ=2, actions such that y_3=2.\n\ny_0=1\n\nIf we do S at τ=0, y_1=1\n\nThen S at τ=1, y_2=1\n\nThen U at τ=2, y_3=2\n\nOr U at τ=0, y_1=2\n\nThen S at τ=1, y_2=2\n\nThen S at τ=2, y_3=2\n\nOr U at τ=0, y_1=2\n\nThen D at τ=1, y_2=1\n\nThen U at τ=2, y_3=2\n\nBut this has extra moves, not efficient.\n\nThe first one: S,S,U: at τ=0, y=1, action S, so at τ=1, y=1 (since y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy, so after action, new position)\n\nAt turn τ=0: position y=1, action a_0=S, so y_1 =1\n\nThen at turn τ=1: position y=1, action a_1=S, y_2=1\n\nAt turn τ=2: position y=1, action a_2=U, y_3=2\n\nAt each turn, we are on freeway y_τ.\n\nAt τ=0: y=1, safe\n\nτ=1: y=1, safe (since freeway 1 safe)\n\nτ=2: y=1, safe\n\nThen at τ=3: y=2, which is safe.\n\ny=2 is freeway 2, which is always safe.\n\nNow from here, at τ=3, y=2, we can start going up.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nFrom y=2, to y=9, need +7, so at least 7 more U.\n\nBut we have to avoid the later unsafe times.\n\nUnsafe at τ=8 and 9 for y=6,7,8.\n\nSpecifically, at τ=8 and 9, if on y=6,7, or 8, collision.\n\nNow, at τ=3, y=2.\n\nIf we go up as fast as possible: U each turn.\n\nThen: at τ=3, y=2\n\nAction U: y_4=3\n\nAt τ=4, y=3\n\nAction U: y_5=4\n\nAt τ=5, y=4\n\nAction U: y_6=5\n\nAt τ=6, y=5\n\nAction U: y_7=6\n\nAt τ=7, y=6\n\nAction U: y_8=7\n\nAt τ=8, y=7\n\nAction U: y_9=8\n\nAt τ=9, y=8\n\nAction U: y_10=9\n\nNow, at τ=10, y=9, which is safe.\n\nBut we need to check for τ=4 to τ=9.\n\nFirst, at τ=3: y=2, safe\n\nτ=4: y=3, freeway 3. Is it safe at τ=4?\n\nEarlier, for y=3, unsafe only at τ=3. At τ=4, freeway 3: spans at τ=4.\n\nFirst car: [ -47 +12*4, -36 +12*4] = [ -47+48, -36+48] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nOthers not, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, τ=5: y=4, freeway 4 at τ=5.\n\ny=4 unsafe only at τ=3, at τ=5 safe.\n\nSimilarly τ=6: y=5, freeway 5 at τ=6. Unsafe only at τ=3, so safe.\n\nτ=7: y=6, freeway 6 at τ=7.\n\nFreeway 6 unsafe at τ=8,9, not at τ=7.\n\nAt τ=7, for freeway 6: car [ -59 +6τ, -48 +6τ ] at τ=7: [ -59+42, -48+42] = [-17,-6], 0 not in, safe.\n\nτ=8: y=7, freeway 7 at τ=8.\n\nBut freeway 7 is unsafe at τ=8.\n\ny=7 at τ=8, freeway 7, which is covered at τ=8, so collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nIn this sequence, at τ=8, we are on y=7, which is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if we continue, at τ=9, y=8, unsafe.\n\nSo need to avoid being on y=6,7,8 at τ=8 and τ=9.\n\nSpecifically, at τ=8, cannot be on y=6,7,8; at τ=9, cannot be on y=6,7,8.\n\nNow, back to τ=3, we are at y=2.\n\nInstead of going straight up, we might need to delay or something.\n\nSince at τ=8 and 9, y=6,7,8 unsafe, we should not be on those rows at those times.\n\nPossible to be higher or lower.\n\nFor example, at τ=8, we can be on y=5 or y=9 or something.\n\ny=5 is safe at τ=8, since unsafe only at τ=3.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 safe.\n\ny=4 safe, etc.\n\ny=6,7,8 unsafe at τ=8 and 9.\n\nSimilarly for τ=9.\n\nNow, at τ=3, y=2.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 by some H.\n\nMinimal H: since from y=2 to y=9, need 7 steps if all U, but might need to wait.\n\nThe unsafe times are τ=8 and 9, so we should pass through y=6,7,8 before τ=8 or after τ=9.\n\nBut τ=8 and 9 are specific times.\n\nLet me list the safe y for each τ around the unsafe times.\n\nFirst, for τ=8: unsafe y:6,7,8; safe y:0,1,2,3,4,5,9\n\nSimilarly τ=9: same, unsafe y:6,7,8; safe y:0,1,2,3,4,5,9\n\nNow, at τ=3, we are at y=2.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nSuppose we go up at some rate.\n\nLet y_τ be position at time τ.\n\nWe need y_8 and y_9 not in {6,7,8}.\n\nAlso, to minimize H, we want to reach y=9 asap.\n\nFrom τ=3, y=2.\n\nIf we go all U: y_4=3, y_5=4, y_6=5, y_7=6, y_8=7, y_9=8, y_10=9\n\nBut y_8=7 and y_9=8, both unsafe at τ=8 and 9.\n\nNot good.\n\nWe could stay longer at lower y to avoid being at y=6,7,8 at τ=8,9.\n\nFor example, at τ=7, if we are at y=5, then at τ=7, y=5, safe.\n\nThen if we do S at τ=7, y_8=5, which is safe at τ=8 (y=5 safe).\n\nThen at τ=8, y=5, action U, y_9=6\n\nBut at τ=9, y=6, which is unsafe at τ=9? Freeway 6 at τ=9 unsafe.\n\ny_9=6, at τ=9, on freeway 6, unsafe.\n\nIf we go to y=6 at τ=9, unsafe.\n\nTo avoid y=6,7,8 at τ=8 and 9, we need to be below or above at those times.\n\nFor example, at τ=8, be at y<=5 or y=9.\n\nSimilarly for τ=9.\n\nBut y=9 might be hard to reach early.\n\nSince from y=2 at τ=3, to y=9, need 7 steps, so earliest at τ=10.\n\ny_3=2, all U: y_4=3, y_5=4, y_6=5, y_7=6, y_8=7, y_9=8, y_10=9\n\nAt τ=10, y=9 safe.\n\nBut at τ=8 and τ=9, y=7 and 8, unsafe.\n\nWe need to modify the path so that at τ=8 and τ=9, we are not on 6,7,8.\n\nSo for τ=8, y_8 <=5 or y_8=9.\n\nBut y_8=9 only if we are faster, but from y_3=2, min τ to reach y=9 is 7, so y_10=9, so y_8 cannot be 9, since y_8 <= y_3 +5 =7 if all U, or less.\n\ny_3=2, after 5 steps to τ=8, y_8 <= 2+5=7, so y_8 <=7, cannot be 9.\n\nSimilarly, y_8 <=7, so to be safe at τ=8, y_8 <=5.\n\nSimilarly at τ=9, y_9 <=8, and to be safe, y_9 <=5 or y_9=9, but y_9=9 possible if we reach early, but from y_3=2, y_9 <=2+6=8, so y_9<=8, cannot be 9 until τ=10 at earliest.\n\nThus at τ=9, y_9 <=8, and to be safe, must have y_9 <=5.\n\nSo we need y_8 <=5 and y_9 <=5.\n\nBut we need to go to y=9, so if we are at y<=5 at τ=8 and τ=9, we are behind, and it will take more turns to reach y=9.\n\nFor example, at τ=9, y_9 <=5, then to y=9, need at least 4 more U, so H at least 13? Let's see.\n\nτ=9 is turn index, y_9 position at turn 9.\n\nThen to reach y=9, need actions from there.\n\nBut minimal H when we reach y=9.\n\nSet τ=3 as start point for simplicity.\n\nAt τ=3, y=2.\n\nWe need to have y_8 <=5 and y_9 <=5.\n\nThen from there, go up.\n\nBut y_9 <=5, and we need to reach y=9.\n\nFor example, suppose at τ=8, y_8=5, at τ=9, y_9=5.\n\nThen from τ=9, we can go U each: y_10=6, y_11=7, y_12=8, y_13=9.\n\nH=13, but we start from τ=0, so total turns from start.\n\nτ is relative, H is the number of actions to reach, so at τ=H, we have y_H=9.\n\nIn terms of turns from t1.\n\nAt τ=3, y=2.\n\nIf we stay low until τ=9.\n\ny_8 <=5 and y_9 <=5.\n\nFor example, we can be at y=5 at τ=8 and τ=9.\n\ny=5 is safe at those times.\n\nThen from τ=9, y=5, go up: U at τ=9, y_10=6; U at τ=10, y_11=7; U at τ=11, y_12=8; U at τ=12, y_13=9.\n\nBut at τ=10, y=6; τ=11, y=7; τ=12, y=8.\n\nNow, are these safe?\n\nFreeway 6 unsafe at τ=8,9, but at τ=10,11,12? τ=10: for freeway 6, at τ=10, span [ -59+60, -48+60] = [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 at τ=11: same as 6, since identical, at τ=11: [ -59+66, -48+66] = [7,18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nFreeway 8 at τ=12: cars, first one [ -59+72, -48+72] = [13,24], 0 not in; second [7+72,18+72]? Freeway 8: second car (18,7,right,6) at τ, [7+6τ,18+6τ]\n\nAt τ=12: [7+72,18+72]=[79,90], no; first car [ -59+72, -48+72]=[13,24], no. So safe.\n\nThus, this works, but H=13 from start? τ=13, y_13=9.\n\nBut we might do better.\n\nPerhaps we can be higher earlier and skip the unsafe rows during unsafe times.\n\nFor example, at τ=8 and 9, be on y=5 or lower, but y=5 is safe.\n\nBut from y=2 at τ=3, if we go up slowly.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y=5 before τ=8, but not stay on y=6,7,8 at τ=8,9.\n\nBut at τ=8,9, we need to be <=5.\n\nSo for instance, reach y=5 by τ=7 or something.\n\nLet's list positions over time.\n\nAt τ=3, y=2.\n\nNow, we need y_τ for τ=4 to 7.\n\nThen at τ=8, y_8 <=5\n\nτ=9, y_9 <=5\n\nThen go up.\n\nBut to minimize H, we should be as high as possible at τ=9, so y_9=5, then from there up.\n\ny_9=5, then y_10=6, y_11=7, y_12=8, y_13=9, so reach at τ=13.\n\nBut earlier at τ=3 we are at y=2, which is low.\n\nIn the beginning, we went to y=2 at τ=3 to avoid the τ=3 unsafe.\n\nBut at τ=3, we could be at y=0 or 1, but y=2 is better than 1 or 0.\n\ny=1 at τ=3 is also safe.\n\nBut y=2 is higher.\n\nNow, from y=2 at τ=3, if we go faster to higher y, but we have to be <=5 at τ=8 and 9.\n\nFor example, from τ=3 to τ=8, 5 steps.\n\ny_3=2, after 5 steps, y_8 = 2 + sum Δy from τ=3 to 7.\n\nEach Δy = -1,0,1.\n\ny_8 <=5.\n\nSimilarly, y_9 = y_8 + Δy_8 <=5.\n\nTo be efficient, we can go up to y=5 by some point and stay.\n\nFor example, suppose we go to y=5 as fast as possible from τ=3.\n\ny_3=2\n\nU at τ=3: y_4=3\n\nU at τ=4: y_5=4\n\nU at τ=5: y_6=5\n\nNow at τ=6, y=5\n\nThen we need to stay at y=5 until τ=9? But at τ=8 and 9, we need to be <=5, so we can stay.\n\nBut at τ=9, y=5, then we go up.\n\nBut let's see the positions.\n\nτ=3: y=2\n\na_3=U: y_4=3\n\nAt τ=4: on y=3, safe? At τ=4, freeway 3: as before, at τ=4, span [1,12] etc., 0 not in, safe.\n\na_4=U: y_5=4\n\nτ=5: y=4, freeway 4 at τ=5. Unsafe only at τ=3, so safe.\n\na_5=U: y_6=5\n\nτ=6: y=5, freeway 5 at τ=6. Safe.\n\nNow at τ=6, y=5, we need to not go up yet because at τ=8 and 9 we need to be <=5.\n\nSo we can stay at y=5 for a few turns.\n\nFor example, S at τ=6: y_7=5\n\nτ=7: y=5, safe\n\nS at τ=7: y_8=5\n\nτ=8: y=5, freeway 5 at τ=8. y=5 unsafe only at τ=3, so at τ=8 safe.\n\nThen at τ=8, action: we need y_9 <=5, so if we do S, y_9=5\n\nOr D, y_9=4, but S to stay at 5.\n\nThen at τ=9: y=5, safe.\n\nThen from here, go up: U at τ=9: y_10=6\n\nτ=10: y=6, freeway 6 at τ=10. As before, [1,12], safe.\n\nU at τ=10: y_11=7\n\nτ=11: y=7, freeway 7 at τ=11. [7,18] or something, safe.\n\nU at τ=11: y_12=8\n\nτ=12: y=8, freeway 8 at τ=12. As before, safe.\n\nU at τ=12: y_13=9\n\nτ=13: y=9, safe.\n\nBut H=13, from start.\n\nWe start from τ=0, and we have actions from τ=0 to τ=12 to reach at τ=13.\n\nBut earlier at beginning, we used 3 turns to go from y=1 to y=2 at τ=3.\n\nIn those 3 turns, we had actions: for example, S at τ=0, S at τ=1, U at τ=2 to get y_3=2.\n\nNow, can we be higher at τ=3?\n\nAt τ=3, y_3 can be up to 4, but y=4 is unsafe at τ=3, y=3 unsafe, so only 0,1,2 safe.\n\ny=2 is the highest possible at τ=3.\n\nSo we are at y=2 at τ=3.\n\nThen from there, we spent turns to stay at y=5 from τ=6 to τ=9, which is 4 turns at y=5, but we could have stayed less.\n\nAt τ=6, y=5, we need y_8 <=5 and y_9 <=5.\n\nIf at τ=7, we go up, but then y_8 might be higher.\n\nFor example, at τ=6, y=5, if we do U, y_7=6\n\nThen at τ=7, y=6\n\nIf we do S, y_8=6, but at τ=8, y=6, which is unsafe! Because freeway 6 unsafe at τ=8.\n\nSimilarly, if we do D, y_8=5, but then at τ=8, y=5, safe, but then at τ=8, if we do S, y_9=5, safe; or U, y_9=6, unsafe at τ=9.\n\nBut we need y_9 <=5, so we must have y_9 <=5.\n\nIf at τ=7, y=6, we cannot stay at 6 because at τ=8, if y=6, unsafe; if we go to y=7, worse.\n\nSo from y=6 at τ=7, the only way to be safe at τ=8 is to move to y not 6, but at τ=8, position y_8.\n\nIf at τ=7, y=6, action D: y_8=5, then at τ=8, y=5, safe.\n\nThen at τ=8, y=5, action S: y_9=5, safe.\n\nThen from τ=9, y=5, go up as before.\n\nBut let's see the sequence from τ=3.\n\ny_3=2\n\na_3=U: y_4=3\n\na_4=U: y_5=4\n\na_5=U: y_6=5\n\nNow at τ=6, y=5\n\nInstead of staying, we could go to y=6, but carefully.\n\na_6=U: y_7=6\n\nAt τ=7, y=6, freeway 6 at τ=7: unsafe? At τ=7, freeway 6: [ -59+42, -48+42] = [-17,-6], 0 not in, safe. Since unsafe only at τ=8,9.\n\nSo at τ=7, y=6 safe.\n\nBut now at τ=7, we need to avoid being on unsafe at τ=8.\n\nSo at τ=7, y=6, action: if we do U, y_8=7, at τ=8, y=7 unsafe.\n\nIf we do S, y_8=6, unsafe.\n\nIf we do D, y_8=5, safe.\n\nSo do D: a_7=D: y_8=5\n\nAt τ=8, y=5, safe (since freeway 5 safe at τ=8)\n\nThen at τ=8, we need y_9 <=5, so action: S or D.\n\nIf S, y_9=5; or D, y_9=4.\n\nBetter to stay or go down? To minimize, stay at 5.\n\na_8=S: y_9=5\n\nAt τ=9, y=5, safe.\n\nThen a_9=U: y_10=6\n\na_10=U: y_11=7\n\na_11=U: y_12=8\n\na_12=U: y_13=9\n\nSame as before, H=13.\n\nBut at τ=10,11,12, y=6,7,8 are safe since τ=10,11,12 not 8 or 9.\n\nNow, we saved one turn? In this case, at τ=6 we went to y=6, then down to y=5 at τ=8, but we were at y=6 at τ=7, which is fine, but we still end up at y=5 at τ=9.\n\nThen to y=9 at τ=13.\n\nSame as staying at y=5 from τ=6 to τ=9, which would be a_6=S, a_7=S, a_8=S, a_9=S, then y_6=5, y_7=5, y_8=5, y_9=5.\n\nThen from y_9=5, U to y_10=6, etc. to y_13=9.\n\nIn the other way, we did a_6=U to y_7=6, a_7=D to y_8=5, a_8=S to y_9=5, same y_9=5.\n\nThen same.\n\nSo no gain.\n\nBut we used a D, which might not be efficient, but in terms of position, same.\n\nNow, to reduce H, we need to be higher at τ=9.\n\nBut at τ=9, we must be <=5 to be safe, so y_9 <=5.\n\nThen from there, min 4 steps to y=9, so y_13=9.\n\nUnless we can be at y=9 before, but from y_3=2, impossible to reach y=9 before τ=10.\n\ny_3=2, all U: y_10=9 at earliest.\n\nBut at τ=10, y=9 safe, but at τ=8 and 9, we have to be on some y, which if we go all U, we are at y=8 at τ=9, unsafe.\n\nAnd we can't skip τ=8 and 9.\n\nSo we must be on some freeway at τ=8 and 9, and to be safe, must be on y<=5 or y=9, but y=9 not possible at τ=8 or 9, so must be on y<=5 at τ=8 and 9.\n\nThus, we are forced to be low at those times, so we need additional turns.\n\nMinimal H is 13.\n\nBut perhaps we can start from the beginning differently.\n\nAt the start, τ=0, y=1.\n\nInstead of going to y=2 at τ=3, we could go to y=1 or y=0 at τ=3, but that would be lower, worse.\n\ny=2 is best.\n\nPerhaps we can go up to y=4 or something but avoid at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=3 and 4 are unsafe, so we cannot be on them.\n\nBut at other times, safe.\n\nFor example, at τ=2, we could be at y=3, which is safe, as in the initial all U attempt.\n\nIn all U: at τ=2, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at τ=2, instead of U to y=4 at τ=3, we could do S or D.\n\nFor example, at τ=2, y=3, action S: then y_3=3\n\nBut at τ=3, y=3, which is unsafe! Freeway 3 unsafe at τ=3.\n\nCollision.\n\nSimilarly, action D: y_3=2, then at τ=3, y=2, safe.\n\nBut then we are at y=2 at τ=3, same as before.\n\nSo no better.\n\nAction at τ=2: if we do D, y_3=2.\n\nSame point.\n\nSo we end up at y=2 at τ=3.\n\nNow, another idea: perhaps go down to y=0 at some point, but that seems worse.\n\nOr, for the later part, instead of being at y=5 at τ=8,9, we could be at y=9, but impossible.\n\nOr, since y=9 is safe, if we can reach it earlier, but from start, min to y=9 is 8 steps: from y=1 to y=9 in 8 U, at τ=8, y=9.\n\nBut at τ=8, y=9 safe, but we have to go through intermediate steps.\n\nFor example, start at τ=0, y=1\n\nU: τ=1, y=2\n\nU: τ=2, y=3\n\nAt τ=2, y=3 safe.\n\nNow, to avoid y=4 at τ=3, we cannot go to y=4.\n\nSo at τ=2, action: if U, y_3=4, unsafe.\n\nIf S, y_3=3, unsafe at τ=3.\n\nIf D, y_3=2, safe.\n\nSo must do D or something.\n\nBut if we do D at τ=2, y_3=2.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nFrom y=1 at τ=0, we could do S at τ=0, y_1=1\n\nS at τ=1, y_2=1\n\nU at τ=2, y_3=2, same as before.\n\nOr, at τ=0, U to y=2 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=2, safe.\n\nThen at τ=1, action: if U, y_2=3\n\nAt τ=2, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at τ=2, if U, y_3=4 unsafe; if S, y_3=3 unsafe; if D, y_3=2 safe.\n\nSo again, to y=2 at τ=3.\n\nNo way to be higher at τ=3 safely.\n\nThus, y_3=2 is optimal.\n\nThen from there, to reach y=9, with the constraint of being <=5 at τ=8 and 9.\n\nNow, τ=8 and 9 are 5 and 6 steps after τ=3.\n\nFrom τ=3 to τ=8 is 5 steps, to τ=9 is 6 steps.\n\ny_3=2\n\nWe need y_8 <=5 and y_9 <=5.\n\nThe earliest to reach y=9 is from y_9=5, then y_13=9, as before.\n\nBut at τ=9, y_9=5, then we go up to y_13=9.\n\nBut τ=9 is the turn index.\n\nWe can reach y=9 at τ=10 if no constraints, but with constraints, later.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=6 at τ=10, but we need to be <=5 at τ=9.\n\ny_9 must be <=5.\n\nFor example, if at τ=8, y_8=5, and at τ=9, y_9=5, then y_10=6, y_11=7, y_12=8, y_13=9.\n\nBut at τ=12, y=8, is it safe? Freeway 8 at τ=12, as before, safe.\n\nBut can we reach y=9 earlier than τ=13?\n\nFor instance, if at τ=9, y_9=4, then we need to go to 9, which takes more steps.\n\nWorse.\n\nOr if we can be at y=9 at τ=9, but impossible from y_3=2.\n\nMin steps from y=2 to y=9 is 7, so τ=10 at earliest.\n\nBut at τ=9, we are at y_9 <=8, and must be <=5, so y_9 <=5, so at τ=9, we are at most 5, so to 9, at least 4 steps, so τ=13.\n\nSimilarly, if we reach y=5 earlier, say at τ=5, but then we have to stay until τ=9, which wastes turns.\n\nFor example, from τ=3 y=2, U to y=3 at τ=4, U to y=4 at τ=5, U to y=5 at τ=6, then stay at y=5 for τ=6,7,8,9: so S at τ=6,7,8 to have y_7=5, y_8=5, y_9=5.\n\nThen U at τ=9 to y_10=6, etc to y_13=9.\n\nIf we go to y=5 faster: from τ=3 y=2, U at τ=3 to y_4=3, U at τ=4 to y_5=4, U at τ=5 to y_6=5.\n\nThen at τ=6 y=5, we need to stay until τ=9.\n\na_6=S: y_7=5, a_7=S: y_8=5, a_8=S: y_9=5.\n\nThen a_9=U: y_10=6, a_10=U: y_11=7, a_11=U: y_12=8, a_12=U: y_13=9.\n\nH=13.\n\nFrom the beginning, actions from τ=0 to τ=12.\n\nτ from 0 to 12, 13 steps, reach at τ=13.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nFirst, from τ=0 to τ=2: to get y_3=2.\n\nFor example: τ=0: y=1, action S (so y_1=1)\n\nτ=1: y=1, action S (y_2=1)\n\nτ=2: y=1, action U (y_3=2)\n\nThen τ=3: y=2, action U (y_4=3)\n\nτ=4: y=3, action U (y_5=4)\n\nτ=5: y=4, action U (y_6=5)\n\nτ=6: y=5, action S (y_7=5)\n\nτ=7: y=5, action S (y_8=5)\n\nτ=8: y=5, action S (y_9=5)\n\nτ=9: y=5, action U (y_10=6)\n\nτ=10: y=6, action U (y_11=7)\n\nτ=11: y=7, action U (y_12=8)\n\nτ=12: y=8, action U (y_13=9)\n\nAt τ=13, y=9, safe.\n\nNow check all for collision:\n\nτ=0: y=1, safe\n\nτ=1: y=1, safe\n\nτ=2: y=1, safe\n\nτ=3: y=2, safe\n\nτ=4: y=3, at τ=4, freeway 3 safe\n\nτ=5: y=4, at τ=5, freeway 4 safe (unsafe only at τ=3)\n\nτ=6: y=5, at τ=6, freeway 5 safe\n\nτ=7: y=5, at τ=7, freeway 5 safe\n\nτ=8: y=5, at τ=8, freeway 5 safe\n\nτ=9: y=5, at τ=9, freeway 5 safe\n\nτ=10: y=6, at τ=10, freeway 6: [ -59+60, -48+60] = [1,12], 0 not in, safe\n\nτ=11: y=7, freeway 7: similarly [ -59+66, -48+66] = [7,18], 0 not in, safe\n\nτ=12: y=8, freeway 8: cars, first [ -59+72, -48+72] = [13,24], 0 not in; second [7+72,18+72]=[79,90], no, safe\n\nτ=13: y=9, safe\n\nAll good.\n\nBut H=13, which is the number of actions? From τ=0 to τ=12, 13 actions, reach at turn τ=13.\n\nBut minimal possible without cars is 8, but with cars, we have delays.\n\nPerhaps we can reduce by not staying so long.\n\nFor example, at τ=9, if we are at y=5, we go up, but we need 4 steps.\n\nBut at τ=8, if we are at y=4, then y_9 could be 4 or 5, then from there up.\n\nBut y=4 to y=9 takes 5 steps, so from y_9=4, to y_14=9, worse.\n\nNot better.\n\nOr, during the stay, we can be at different y, as long as at τ=8 and 9, y<=5.\n\nFor example, from τ=3 y=2, we can go to y=5 by τ=6, then at τ=6 y=5, we can go down and up, but that might not help.\n\nFor instance, at τ=6 y=5, we do D to y_7=4, then at τ=7 y=4, safe, then U to y_8=5, at τ=8 y=5 safe, then S to y_9=5, then U to y_10=6, etc., but same number of steps.\n\nNo gain.\n\nSo H=13 seems necessary.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach y=9 faster by being at higher y when possible.\n\nAnother idea: since at τ=3, we are at y=2, and we need to be low at τ=8 and 9, but τ=8 and 9 are later, we can go up to y=8 before τ=8, but y=8 at τ=7 for example.\n\ny=8 at τ=7 is safe, since unsafe only at τ=8,9.\n\nThen at τ=7, y=8, we need to move to avoid being on y=8 at τ=8.\n\nSo at τ=7, action: if U, to y=9, but y=9 is safe, and we reach early.\n\nLet's see.\n\nFrom τ=3 y=2:\n\nGo all U: a_3=U: y_4=3\n\na_4=U: y_5=4\n\na_5=U: y_6=5\n\na_6=U: y_7=6\n\na_7=U: y_8=7? Not yet.\n\ny_3=2\n\na_3=U: y_4=3\n\na_4=U: y_5=4\n\na_5=U: y_6=5\n\na_6=U: y_7=6\n\nAt τ=7, y=6\n\nNow a_7=U: y_8=7\n\nBut at τ=8, y=7, unsafe.\n\na_7=S: y_8=6, unsafe at τ=8.\n\na_7=D: y_8=5, safe at τ=8.\n\nThen at τ=8, y=5, action: to have y_9<=5, say S, y_9=5.\n\nThen from there, same as before.\n\nBut if at τ=7, y=6, we do U to y_8=7, but unsafe.\n\nCannot.\n\nUnless we go to y=9 from y=6? No, y=6 to y=9 in one step? Impossible, Δy=1 per step.\n\nSo at τ=7, y=6, we can only go to y=5,6,7 at τ=8.\n\nAll problematic at τ=8 except y=5.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps from lower y, go slower so that at τ=8 we are at y=5.\n\nBut we are at y=2 at τ=3, to y=5 at τ=8, we can take 5 steps to go from 2 to 5, net +3, so we can have some S.\n\nFor example, y_3=2, then actions: U,U,U,S,S or something to have y_8=5.\n\nBut y_8=5, then y_9=5, then up to y_13=9.\n\nSame as before.\n\nI think H=13 is the minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the starting actions.\n\nIn the sequence above, we used S,S,U to go from y=1 to y=2 at τ=3.\n\nBut at τ=0, we could do U to y=2 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=2, safe.\n\nThen at τ=1, action S: y_2=2\n\nThen at τ=2, y=2, action U: y_3=3? But at τ=3, y=3 unsafe.\n\nIf at τ=1, y=2, action U: y_2=3\n\nAt τ=2, y=3, safe (since unsafe only at τ=3)\n\nThen at τ=2, y=3, action: if U, y_3=4 unsafe; S, y_3=3 unsafe; D, y_3=2 safe.\n\nSo y_3=2.\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo no improvement.\n\nThus, minimal H is 13.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we need to output actions from turn t1=3.\n\nt1=3, which is τ=0.\n\nActions from τ=0 to τ=12.\n\nIn the sequence I have:\n\nτ=0: S\n\nτ=1: S\n\nτ=2: U\n\nτ=3: U\n\nτ=4: U\n\nτ=5: U\n\nτ=6: S\n\nτ=7: S\n\nτ=8: S\n\nτ=9: U\n\nτ=10: U\n\nτ=11: U\n\nτ=12: U\n\nWith positions: after actions.\n\nAt turn τ, action a_τ, then y_{τ+1} = new position.\n\nBut at turn τ, we are at y_τ before action.\n\nIn collision check, at turn τ, position y_τ.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nTurn τ=0 (t1=3): position y=1, action S, so y_1=1\n\nTurn τ=1: position y=1, action S, y_2=1\n\nTurn τ=2: position y=1, action U, y_3=2\n\nTurn τ=3: position y=2, action U, y_4=3\n\nTurn τ=4: position y=3, action U, y_5=4\n\nTurn τ=5: position y=4, action U, y_6=5\n\nTurn τ=6: position y=5, action S, y_7=5\n\nTurn τ=7: position y=5, action S, y_8=5\n\nTurn τ=8: position y=5, action S, y_9=5\n\nTurn τ=9: position y=5, action U, y_10=6\n\nTurn τ=10: position y=6, action U, y_11=7\n\nTurn τ=11: position y=7, action U, y_12=8\n\nTurn τ=12: position y=8, action U, y_13=9\n\nAt τ=13, y=9 reached.\n\nNumber of actions: from τ=0 to τ=12, 13 actions, H=13.\n\nIn the output, we need the sequence of actions starting from turn t1.\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1} = a_τ=0 = S\n\nTurn t1+1: a_{t1+1} = a_τ=1 = S\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t1 + H-1, but H is the number of turns to reach, so actions from t1 to t1 + H-1, and after last action, at turn t1 + H, position is (0,9).\n\nIn this case, after 13 actions, at turn t1 + 13, position is (0,9).\n\nSo H=13.\n\nThe sequence should be for turns from t1 to t1 + 12.\n\nActions: a_{t1} to a_{t1+12}\n\nWith a_{t1+12} being the last action.\n\nAfter a_{t1+12}, at turn t1+13, y=9.\n\nNow, to write the sequence.\n\nBut in the sequence, we can have different actions as long as we reach.\n\nFor example, at the beginning, instead of S,S,U, we can do U at τ=0 to y=2 at τ=1, then S at τ=1 to y=2 at τ=2, then D or something to y=2 at τ=3.\n\nBut D is not necessary.\n\nIn my sequence, I used S,S,U to get to y=2 at τ=3.\n\nWith U at τ=0: τ=0: y=1, action U, y_1=2\n\nτ=1: y=2, action S, y_2=2\n\nτ=2: y=2, action S, y_3=2? y_3=2\n\nThen same as before.\n\nOr at τ=2, action U, but y_3=3, unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo only ways to have y_3=2.\n\nSimilarly, later part.\n\nNow for the output.\n\nAlso, in the car state, for freeway 8, there is another car (18,7,right,6), but it doesn't cover x=0, so fine.\n\nI think the sequence is fine.\n\nBut H=13, but let's see if we can do with less.\n\nSuppose at τ=9, we are at y=5, but if we can be at y=6 at τ=10, etc., but we need 4 steps to 9.\n\nPerhaps at τ=8, we are at y=5, but if we go to y=6 at τ=9, but at τ=9, y=6 unsafe, so we cannot be on y=6 at τ=9.\n\nMust y_9 <=5.\n\nNo choice.\n\nThus, minimal H is 13.\n\nSo the sequence of actions.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nStart from turn t1=3.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 3: S\n\nTurn 4: S\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nBut turn t1=3, τ=0.\n\nIn terms of absolute turns.\n\nt1=3.\n\nTurn t1: turn 3, action a_{3}\n\nIn the sequence: turn 3: action for τ=0\n\nturn 4: action for τ=1\n\n...\n\nturn 15: action for τ=12\n\nThen after that, at turn 16, position (0,9).\n\nt1 + H = 3 + 13 =16.\n\nActions from turn 3 to turn 15, 13 actions.\n\nNow, in my sequence:\n\nFor turn 3 (τ=0): action S\n\nTurn 4 (τ=1): action S\n\nTurn 5 (τ=2): action U\n\nTurn 6 (τ=3): action U\n\nTurn 7 (τ=4): action U\n\nTurn 8 (τ=5): action U\n\nTurn 9 (τ=6): action S\n\nTurn 10 (τ=7): action S\n\nTurn 11 (τ=8): action S\n\nTurn 12 (τ=9): action U\n\nTurn 13 (τ=10): action U\n\nTurn 14 (τ=11): action U\n\nTurn 15 (τ=12): action U\n\nAfter turn 15 action, at turn 16, y=9.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut in the sequence, at the beginning, we did two S at y=1, which is fine.\n\nWe could do U at turn 3 to go to y=2 at turn 4.\n\nTurn 3: action U, so at turn 4, y=2.\n\nThen turn 4: action S, to stay at y=2 for turn 5? Let's see timing.\n\nAt turn 3 (t1=3, τ=0): position y=1, action U, so y_1=2 for τ=1, turn 4.\n\nAt turn 4 (τ=1): position y=2, action S, so y_2=2 for turn 5.\n\nAt turn 5 (τ=2): position y=2, action S, so y_3=2 for turn 6.\n\nThen same as before, at turn 6 (τ=3): position y=2, action U, to y=3 at turn 7, etc.\n\nIn this case, at τ=2, we are at y=2, which is fine.\n\nThen from there, same actions as before.\n\nIn terms of turn numbers, it shifts.\n\nBut H is the same.\n\nI think it's fine.\n\nSo for the output, I'll use the first sequence.\n\nNow, to box the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 3\\) is 13. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on an unsafe freeway at critical times. Specifically:\n- At turn \\(T = t_1 + 3 = 6\\) (relative time \\(\\tau = 3\\)), freeways \\(y = 3, 4, 5\\) are unsafe due to car coverage at \\(x = 0\\). The player must be at \\(y \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}\\) at this turn.\n- At turns \\(T = t_1 + 8 = 11\\) and \\(T = t_1 + 9 = 12\\) (relative times \\(\\tau = 8, 9\\)), freeways \\(y = 6, 7, 8\\) are unsafe. The player must be at \\(y \\leq 5\\) or \\(y = 9\\) at these turns, but \\(y = 9\\) is unreachable by \\(\\tau = 9\\), so \\(y \\leq 5\\) is required.\n\nStarting from \\(y = 1\\) at \\(\\tau = 0\\) (turn 3), the player:\n- Stays at \\(y = 1\\) for turns 3 and 4 (actions S, S) to reach \\(y = 2\\) at \\(\\tau = 3\\) (turn 6) safely.\n- Moves up to \\(y = 5\\) by turn 9 (actions U at turns 6, 7, 8, 9 for \\(\\tau = 3\\) to \\(\\tau = 6\\)).\n- Stays at \\(y = 5\\) for turns 10, 11, and 12 (actions S, S, S) to avoid being on \\(y = 6, 7, 8\\) at \\(\\tau = 8\\) and \\(\\tau = 9\\) (turns 11 and 12).\n- Moves up to \\(y = 9\\) from turn 13 to 16 (actions U at turns 13, 14, 15, 16), reaching the goal at turn 16.\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 3: S \\\\\nTurn 4: S \\\\\nTurn 5: U \\\\\nTurn 6: U \\\\\nTurn 7: U \\\\\nTurn 8: U \\\\\nTurn 9: S \\\\\nTurn 10: S \\\\\nTurn 11: S \\\\\nTurn 12: U \\\\\nTurn 13: U \\\\\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,2) at turn t_1 = 5 to (0,9) in the fewest turns possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically: U for up (+1), D for down (-1), S for stay (0). The grid y goes from 0 to 9, so y=9 is the goal.\n\nCars are on freeways y=1 to 8, each with their positions and movements. Collision happens if at any turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for a car on that freeway, 0 (the x-position where the player is) is within the car's span at that turn.\n\nImportant note: when the player moves to a new y, at turn T, they are on y_T, and only collide if 0 is in the car's span at exactly turn T for that freeway. If they move to y_{T+1} at turn T, they are not on y_{T+1} until turn T+1, so they don't collide with cars on y_{T+1} at turn T.\n\nCurrent turn is t_1 = 5. Player at (0,2).\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions starting from turn 5, and H is the number of turns, so actions from t=5 to t=5+H-1, and at turn 5+H-1, y should be 9.\n\nH is the minimal number of turns to reach y=9.\n\nFirst, since the player starts at y=2 and needs to go to y=9, the minimum vertical moves needed are 7 steps up (since 9-2=7). But because of cars, I might need to stay or even go down sometimes to avoid collisions, so H could be more than 7.\n\nBut I should aim for H=7 if possible, meaning all actions are U.\n\nBut I need to check if that's possible without colliding.\n\nThe player is on a freeway only when y is between 1 and 8. y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars. At y=0, no collision, and at y=9, goal.\n\nIn the movement, when at y=0, if I try to go down, y stays 0, since y_{t+1} in [0,9], so no problem.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, if I go up, it stays 9.\n\nBut here, start at y=2, which is freeway, so I need to be careful.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars and their movements.\n\nThe car state is given for freeways 1 to 8.\n\nFreeway k means y=k.\n\nFor each car, it has head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s.\n\nDirection: left or right. Left-moving means it moves left, so position decreases over time. Right-moving means position increases.\n\nThe span update:\n\nFor left-moving car: at time T, span is [h - s(T - t_1), tau - s(T - t_1)]\n\nt_1 is current turn, 5.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: [tau + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]\n\nIn the table, for left-moving, it says \"Span(t_1) = [h, tau]\" and then at T, [h - s(T-t_1), tau - s(T-t_1)]\n\nBut [h, tau] with h and tau, which is head and tail.\n\nIn the notation, for left-moving, head and tail: since it's moving left, head is the front when moving left, so if moving left, head should be the right end if we think of x-axis, but the span is given.\n\nLet's see an example.\n\nFor freeway 1: cars (12, 47, left, 36)\n\n(12,47, left, 36). But 12 and 47, if head is 12 and tail is 47, but moving left, so head should be larger number if x increases to the right? I think I need to assume the coordinate system.\n\nTypically, x=0 is the player position, and cars move on the x-axis.\n\nFor a left-moving car, if head is at h and tail at tau, with h < tau or h > tau?\n\nThe span is given as [h, tau] at t_1.\n\nIn freeway 1: (12,47, left, 36), and direction left, so at t_1, span is [12,47]? But if moving left, and head is 12, tail is 47, but 12 to 47, if moving left, it should be that head is at higher x, tail at lower, so [tau, h] with tau < h.\n\nI think there might be inconsistency in notation.\n\nLook at the car update:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, tau] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), tau - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIf at t_1, [h,tau], and moving left, so h should be the right end, tau left end? But [h,tau] might not be ordered.\n\nIn the example, for freeway 1: (12,47, left,36), so h=12, tau=47? But 12 to 47, with direction left, so if moving left, the car should be from x=47 to x=12? That would be decreasing, so head at 47, tail at 12? But it says head h, tail tau.\n\nI think I need to interpret the head and tail properly.\n\nPerhaps in the notation, for a car, head and tail are given, and the span is from min to max or what.\n\nLet's see the direction.\n\nFor left-moving car, when it moves, the span shifts left, so both h and tau decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, both increase.\n\nIn the span definition, for left-moving at T, [h - sΔT, tau - sΔT], with ΔT = T - t_1.\n\nFor it to be a valid span, if the car is moving left, h should be greater than tau, or less? If [h - sΔT, tau - sΔT], and the car moves left, so the values decrease, so at t_1, if h > tau, then [tau, h] would be the interval, but here it's written as [h,tau], which might imply h to tau, but if h< tau, it's increasing, but for left-moving, it should be decreasing.\n\nI think there's a confusion.\n\nLook at freeway 3: it has multiple cars, and for right-moving, it says \"Span(t_1) = [tau, h]\" for right-moving.\n\nIn the car update rules:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, tau] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), tau - s (T-t_1)]\n\n- Right-moving: Span(t_1) = [tau, h] → Span(T) = [tau + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\n\nFor left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, tau], which might not be ordered, but after update, it's [h - sΔT, tau - sΔT], so the order depends on h and tau.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [tau, h], and at T, [tau + sΔT, h + sΔT].\n\nIn freeway 1: (12,47, left,36), so h=12, tau=47, direction left.\n\nAt t_1=5, span is [12,47], but since it's moving left, and 12 < 47, [12,47] is from left to right, but moving left means the car is moving towards decreasing x, so at next turn, the span will be [12-36, 47-36] = [-24,11], for example.\n\nThe collision point is x=0, so if 0 is in the span at turn T for the freeway the player is on.\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t_1) = [tau, h], so for example, freeway 3: (-12,-23, right,12), so tau=-12, h=-23? But tau and h, Span(t_1) = [tau, h] = [-12, -23], which is not ordered, but it's an interval from min to max? Or is it specified?\n\nIn the span, for collision, we care about the set of x covered, so the span should be the interval from left to right, but in the notation, for left-moving, [h,tau] might not be sorted.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I should think of the span as a closed interval, and for collision, 0 in [min, max] of the span at time T.\n\nFor a car, at time T, the span is:\n\nIf left-moving: [min(h,tau) - s(T-t_1), max(h,tau) - s(T-t_1)]? Not necessarily.\n\nFrom the update, for left-moving, the span at T is [h - sΔT, tau - sΔT], so the lower bound is min(h - sΔT, tau - sΔT), upper bound max of those.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, [tau + sΔT, h + sΔT], so lower bound min(tau + sΔT, h + sΔT), upper bound max.\n\nBut in practice, for collision, we need 0 to be between the min and max of the span.\n\nSince it's a continuous interval, 0 is in the span if min <= 0 <= max or min >= 0 >= max depending on order, but easier to compute the actual values.\n\nLet's define for each car, the position at time T.\n\nSince t_1 = 5, let τ = T - 5, so τ is the number of turns after t_1.\n\nFor turn T, τ = T - 5.\n\nThen for a car on freeway k:\n\nLeft-moving: span at T is [h - s τ, tau - s τ]\n\nRight-moving: span at T is [tau + s τ, h + s τ]\n\nThen collision if player is on freeway y at turn T, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in [low, high] where low and high are the min and max of the span values.\n\nBut since the span is given as two points, we need to consider the interval they define.\n\nFor example, if for left-moving, h - sτ and tau - sτ, the span is from min of those to max of those.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving.\n\nIn the case where h and tau are such that at t_1, [h,tau] is not ordered, but after shift, it might be.\n\nBut for collision, it's the set of points covered.\n\nSo I'll compute for each car the min and max x at time T.\n\nLet's list all cars per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (h=12, tau=47, d=left, s=36)\n\nSince d=left, at time T, span: [12 - 36τ, 47 - 36τ] where τ = T - 5\n\nSo min x = min(12-36τ, 47-36τ) = 12-36τ since 12<47, so min=12-36τ, max=47-36τ\n\nSo span: [12-36τ, 47-36τ]\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: (12,47,left,36), so same span: [12-36τ, 47-36τ]\n\nFreeway 3: three cars:\n\nFirst car: (-12, -23, right, 12)  -- d=right\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t_1) = [tau, h] = [-12, -23]? But tau and h, Span(t_1) = [tau, h] = [-12, -23], which is not ordered, but at T, [tau + s τ, h + s τ] = [-12 + 12τ, -23 + 12τ]\n\nSince -12 > -23, min is -23 +12τ, max is -12 +12τ? Let's see:\n\n-23 +12τ and -12 +12τ, since -23 < -12, so min = -23 +12τ, max = -12 +12τ\n\nSo span for this car: [ -23 +12τ, -12 +12τ ]\n\nSimilarly, second car on freeway 3: (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\ntau=-48, h=-59, d=right\n\nSpan at T: [tau + s τ, h + s τ] = [-48 + 12τ, -59 + 12τ]\n\n-48 > -59, so min = -59 +12τ, max = -48 +12τ\n\nThird car on freeway 3: (36, 25, right, 12)  -- (h=36, tau=25, d=right)\n\nSpan(t_1) = [tau, h] = [25, 36]\n\nAt T: [25 + 12τ, 36 + 12τ] , min=25+12τ, max=36+12τ\n\nNow for freeway 4: same as freeway 3: three cars identical: (-12,-23,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12), (36,25,right,12)\n\nSo same spans as above.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 3 and 4.\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (-36, -47, right, 6)\n\nd=right, so Span(t_1) = [tau, h] = [-36, -47]? tau=-36, h=-47\n\nAt T: [tau + s τ, h + s τ] = [-36 + 6τ, -47 + 6τ]\n\nmin = -47 +6τ (since -47 < -36), max = -36 +6τ\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway 6: (-36,-47,right,6), so span [ -47 +6τ, -36 +6τ ]\n\nFreeway 8: two cars:\n\nFirst: (-36,-47,right,6) same as above, span [ -47 +6τ, -36 +6τ ]\n\nSecond: (30,19,right,6) -- (h=30, tau=19, d=right)\n\nSpan(t_1) = [tau, h] = [19,30]\n\nAt T: [19 + 6τ, 30 + 6τ], min=19+6τ, max=30+6τ\n\nNow, player starts at y=2 at τ=0 (turn T=5).\n\ny=2 is freeway 2.\n\nAt turn T, player is at y_T, which depends on actions.\n\nGoal is to reach y=9.\n\nMinimum moves: 7 up, so H=7 possible if no collisions.\n\nBut need to check for each turn from τ=0 to τ=6, when player is on y=2 to y=8, whether at that turn, for that freeway, 0 is in any car's span.\n\nSince player moves one step per turn, from y=2 to y=3 at next turn, etc.\n\nLet me denote the turn from t_1=5, so turns: T=5,6,7,... with τ=0,1,2,...\n\nAt turn T=5+τ, player has position y_{5+τ}, which depends on actions at previous turns.\n\nAction at time t determines Δy for y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo for sequence, actions from t=5 to t=5+H-1, and y_{5+H-1} =9.\n\nAt turn t, player is at y_t.\n\nFor collision at turn t, if y_t is between 1 and 8, and for some car on freeway y_t, 0 is in the span at time t.\n\nNow, for freeway y, at time t, the cars on that freeway.\n\nLet's list for each freeway and for each τ, whether 0 is covered by any car on that freeway at τ.\n\nτ = t - 5, so for time T=5+τ.\n\nFor a given freeway k and time τ, we can compute if there is a car with 0 in span.\n\nThen for the player, when on freeway k at turn τ, if 0 is covered, collision.\n\nNow, let's make a table for each freeway and τ.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car, span [12-36τ, 47-36τ]\n\n0 in span if 12-36τ <= 0 <= 47-36τ\n\nSince 12-36τ <= 47-36τ always, so we need 12-36τ <= 0 and 0 <= 47-36τ\n\nWhich is 12-36τ <=0 => 36τ >=12 => τ >= 12/36 = 1/3, so τ >=1 since τ integer\n\nAnd 0 <= 47-36τ => 36τ <=47 => τ <= 47/36 ≈ 1.305, so τ <=1\n\nThus for τ=1: 12-36*1 = 12-36= -24 <=0, and 0<=47-36=11, yes 0 in [-24,11]\n\nFor τ=0: 12-0=12 <=0? 12<=0 false, so 0 not <=12? 0 <=47 is true, but 12-0=12>0, so 0 < min, not in span.\n\nAt τ=0, min=12, max=47, both >0, so 0 not in [12,47]\n\nAt τ=1, min=-24, max=11, -24<=0<=11, yes.\n\nAt τ=2, min=12-72= -60, max=47-72= -25, both negative, 0 > max, not in span.\n\nSo for freeway 1, collision at τ=1 only, i.e., turn T=6.\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1, since same car: collision only at τ=1, T=6.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-12,-23,right,12), span [ -23 +12τ, -12 +12τ ]\n\n0 in span if -23+12τ <=0 <= -12+12τ\n\nSince min and max: -23+12τ <= -12+12τ always, so need -23+12τ <=0 and 0<= -12+12τ\n\nFirst: -23+12τ <=0 => 12τ <=23 => τ <= 23/12 ≈ 1.916, so τ <=1\n\nSecond: 0<= -12+12τ => 12 <=12τ => τ >=1\n\nSo for τ=1: -23+12= -11 <=0, and 0<= -12+12=0, 0<=0 true, so yes, 0 in span.\n\nFor τ=0: -23 <=0 true, but 0<= -12? 0<=-12 false, so not in span.\n\nFor τ=2: -23+24=1 <=0? 1<=0 false, so not.\n\nSo only at τ=1.\n\nSecond car on freeway 3: (-48,-59,right,12), span [ -59 +12τ, -48 +12τ ]\n\n0 in span if -59+12τ <=0 <= -48+12τ\n\nNeed -59+12τ <=0 => 12τ <=59 => τ <= 59/12 ≈4.916, τ<=4\n\nAnd 0 <= -48+12τ => 48 <=12τ => τ >=4\n\nSo for τ=4: -59+48= -11 <=0, 0<= -48+48=0, yes.\n\nτ=3: -59+36= -23 <=0 true, but 0 <= -48+36= -12? 0<=-12 false, not.\n\nτ=5: -59+60=1 <=0 false, not.\n\nSo only at τ=4.\n\nThird car: (36,25,right,12), span [25+12τ, 36+12τ]\n\nBoth positive for τ>=0, min=25+12τ >=25>0, so 0 not in span for any τ.\n\nSo for freeway 3, collisions at τ=1 (from first car) and τ=4 (from second car).\n\nNow freeway 4: same as freeway 3, so collisions at τ=1 and τ=4.\n\nFreeway 5: same, collisions at τ=1 and τ=4.\n\nNow freeway 6: one car (-36,-47,right,6), span [ -47 +6τ, -36 +6τ ]\n\n0 in span if -47+6τ <=0 <= -36+6τ\n\nNeed -47+6τ <=0 => 6τ <=47 => τ <= 47/6 ≈7.833, τ<=7\n\nAnd 0 <= -36+6τ => 36 <=6τ => τ >=6\n\nSo for τ=6: -47+36= -11 <=0, 0<= -36+36=0, yes\n\nτ=7: -47+42= -5 <=0, 0<= -36+42=6, yes? 0<=6 true, and -5<=0 true, so yes.\n\nAt τ=6: min=-47+36= -11, max=-36+36=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 included.\n\nAt τ=7: min=-47+42= -5, max=-36+42=6, [ -5,6], 0 in it.\n\nAt τ=5: min=-47+30= -17, max=-36+30= -6, both negative, 0 > max, not.\n\nτ=8: min=-47+48=1, max=-36+48=12, both >0, 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 6, collision at τ=6 and τ=7.\n\nNow freeway 7: same as freeway 6, one car, span [ -47 +6τ, -36 +6τ ], so collision at τ=6 and τ=7.\n\nNow freeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-36,-47,right,6), same as above, span [ -47 +6τ, -36 +6τ ], collision at τ=6 and τ=7.\n\nSecond car: (30,19,right,6), span [19+6τ, 30+6τ]\n\nmin=19+6τ >=19>0, so 0 not in span for any τ.\n\nSo for freeway 8, only the first car causes collision at τ=6 and τ=7.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway and τ when collision occurs (0 covered):\n\nFreeway 1: collision at τ=1\n\nFreeway 2: collision at τ=1\n\nFreeway 3: collision at τ=1 and τ=4\n\nFreeway 4: collision at τ=1 and τ=4\n\nFreeway 5: collision at τ=1 and τ=4\n\nFreeway 6: collision at τ=6 and τ=7\n\nFreeway 7: collision at τ=6 and τ=7\n\nFreeway 8: collision at τ=6 and τ=7\n\nAt other times, no collision for that freeway.\n\nPlayer starts at y=2 at τ=0.\n\nAt τ=0, turn T=5, player at y=2.\n\nFreeway 2 at τ=0: no collision, as we saw earlier.\n\nPlayer can be at y=2 safely at τ=0.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\nThe path: from y=2, we need to reach y=9.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0,+1.\n\nTo minimize H, we want to go up as much as possible.\n\nBut avoid being on a freeway when collision occurs for that τ.\n\nFor example, at τ=1, which is turn T=6, if player is on freeway 1,2,3,4, or 5, collision occurs.\n\nFreeways 1 to 5 have collision at τ=1.\n\nSpecifically, freeway 1,2,3,4,5 all have collision at τ=1.\n\nFreeway 6,7,8 no collision at τ=1.\n\nSimilarly at other times.\n\nPlayer at τ=0, y=2.\n\nAfter action at turn t=5 (τ=0), y_{6} = y_5 + Δy, so at turn T=6 (τ=1), player is at y_6.\n\nIf at τ=1, player is on y=1 to 5, collision.\n\nBut y=6,7,8 are safe at τ=1.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=4, freeway 3,4,5 have collision.\n\nAt τ=6 and 7, freeway 6,7,8 have collision.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 in min turns.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=2.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nThe earliest possible: if we go up every turn, y increases by 1 each turn.\n\nSo at τ=0, y=2\n\nAfter action U at t=5, y_6 = 3\n\nAction U at t=6, y_7=4\n\nU at t=7, y_8=5\n\nU at t=8, y_9=6\n\nU at t=9, y_10=7\n\nU at t=10, y_11=8\n\nU at t=11, y_12=9\n\nNow, check for each turn if collision.\n\nAt turn T=5, τ=0, y=2: freeway 2, at τ=0, no collision, ok.\n\nT=6, τ=1, y=3: freeway 3, at τ=1, collision! Because freeway 3 has collision at τ=1.\n\nSo cannot be on y=3 at τ=1.\n\nSimilarly, if on y=2 at τ=1, but at τ=1, y=2 would be freeway 2, which also collision at τ=1.\n\nOr y=1, same.\n\nOnly y=6,7,8 safe at τ=1.\n\nBut in the direct path, at τ=1, y=3, which has collision.\n\nSo need to avoid being on y=1,2,3,4,5 at τ=1.\n\nSince at τ=1, only y=6,7,8 are safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are also safe, but y=0 is below.\n\nAt τ=0, y=2.\n\nAction at τ=0 (t=5) determines y at τ=1.\n\nIf action U, y=3 at τ=1, but collision.\n\nIf action D, y=1 at τ=1, freeway 1, collision at τ=1.\n\nIf action S, y=2 at τ=1, freeway 2, collision.\n\nSo no matter what action at t=5, at τ=1, y will be 1,2, or 3, all of which have collision at τ=1 for their freeways.\n\ny=1: freeway 1, collision at τ=1\n\ny=2: freeway 2, collision\n\ny=3: freeway 3, collision\n\nSo impossible to be safe at τ=1 if we are on y=1,2,3 at that time.\n\nBut we start at y=2, and after one action, we must be on y=1,2, or 3 at τ=1.\n\nTherefore, at τ=1, we must be on a freeway with collision, so collision inevitable at turn T=6?\n\nBut that can't be right; perhaps I can be on y=0 or y=9, but y=0 is possible.\n\nAt τ=0, y=2.\n\nIf I go down, action D at t=5, then y_6 = y_5 + (-1) = 2-1=1\n\nThen at T=6, τ=1, y=1, freeway 1, collision.\n\nIf I stay, S, y=2, freeway 2, collision.\n\nIf up, U, y=3, freeway 3, collision.\n\nSo indeed, no matter what, at τ=1, player is on y=1,2, or 3, all of which have collision at τ=1.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to avoid collision at turn T=6 if we are on freeway at that time.\n\nBut y=0 is not a freeway; at y=0, no cars, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 no cars.\n\nSo if at τ=1, player is at y=0, then no collision.\n\nSimilarly, if at y=9, but not yet.\n\nSo at τ=0, y=2, I need to be at y=0 at τ=1 to avoid collision.\n\nBut from y=2, to be at y=0 at next turn, I need to go down twice? But I can only change by one per turn.\n\nAt turn t=5, action a_5, then y_6 = y_5 + Δy, with |Δy| <=1.\n\nSo from y=2, after one action, y_6 can be 1,2, or 3, not 0 directly.\n\ny_6 = 1,2, or 3, all freeways, all have collision at τ=1.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to avoid collision at turn T=6, because no action can take me to y=0 or y=9 in one step from y=2.\n\nBut that seems like a problem; perhaps I misinterpreted the collision or the movement.\n\nAnother thing: the note says that if you move to y_{T+1} at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, only at T+1.\n\nBut at turn T, you are on y_T.\n\nFor turn T=6, τ=1, player is at y_6, which is set by action at t=5.\n\nAnd y_6 must be between 0 and 9.\n\nIf y_6 =0, no collision, since no freeway.\n\nBut from y_5=2, I can only reach y_6=1,2,3, all freeways, so collision at T=6.\n\nUnless I can be at y=0.\n\nBut I can't reach y=0 in one step from y=2.\n\nPerhaps at some point I can be at y=0.\n\nBut at τ=1, I must be on freeway, so collision.\n\nPerhaps for the initial position, at turn t_1=5, player is at (0,2), which is on freeway, but at τ=0, freeway 2 has no collision, as we saw.\n\nThe problem is at τ=1.\n\nBut let's confirm the collision times.\n\nFreeway 2 at τ=1: for freeway 2, at τ=1, span [12-36*1, 47-36*1] = [-24,11], 0 in [-24,11], yes, so if on freeway 2 at τ=1, collision.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo it seems impossible to avoid collision at T=6.\n\nBut that can't be; perhaps I need to be on a different y at τ=1.\n\nBut I can't reach y=6,7,8 from y=2 in one step.\n\ny=6 is 4 steps up, not possible.\n\nSo the only way is to not be on freeway at τ=1, but I can't reach y=0 or y=9.\n\ny=9 is far.\n\nSo perhaps the minimal H requires that at turn T=6, we are not on freeway, but it's impossible from start.\n\nUnless I can do something at earlier turns, but t_1=5 is the start, so at turn 5, I have to choose action.\n\nPerhaps for the player, when at y=0, I can stay there for some turns.\n\nBut at τ=0, I am at y=2, not 0.\n\nSo I think there is a mistake.\n\nAnother possibility: the collision occurs only if 0 is in the span and the player is on that freeway at that turn.\n\nBut at y=0, no freeway, so safe.\n\nBut I can't reach y=0 at τ=1.\n\nPerhaps at turn T=5, I can go down, but y=1 at T=6, which is freeway 1, collision.\n\nOr, let's list all possible actions.\n\nAt t=5, action a5:\n\n- If U, y6=3\n\n- If S, y6=2\n\n- If D, y6=1\n\nAll lead to collision at T=6.\n\nSo the only way is to not be at turn T=6 at all, but that doesn't make sense; we have to go through turns.\n\nPerhaps for the turn when I move, the collision is checked after movement or something, but the rule says: collision at turn T if on freeway and 0 in span at T.\n\nAnd the note says that when you move to a new y at turn T, you are not on that new y until turn T+1.\n\nBut at the turn of movement, you are on the old y.\n\nLet's read the note carefully.\n\n\"Note that if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 in span at T but not at T+1.\"\n\nBut for the current position, at turn T, you are on y_T.\n\nIf you move at turn T to a different y, then at turn T, you are still on y_T, and at turn T+1, you are on y_{T+1}.\n\nFor collision at turn T, it depends on y_T and the cars on y_T at time T.\n\nAt turn T, when you are on y_T, and if y_T is freeway, and 0 in span at T for some car on y_T, collision.\n\nIn this case, at T=5, τ=0, y=2, freeway 2, no collision, ok.\n\nAt T=6, τ=1, y= y6, which is 1,2, or 3 depending on action, all freeways with collision at τ=1, so collision at T=6 inevitable.\n\nBut that means the player must collide at T=6, which is a problem for reaching the goal.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 2, at τ=1, collision, but let's double-check the span.\n\nFreeway 2: same as 1, at τ=1, [12-36, 47-36] = [-24,11], 0 is in this interval, yes.\n\nSimilarly for y=3 at τ=1, freeway 3, first car span [ -23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], 0 in it.\n\nYes.\n\nSo it seems that at T=6, whatever y the player is on, it will be a freeway with collision.\n\nUnless the player can be on y=0 at T=6, but from y=2, impossible in one step.\n\nTherefore, the only way is to have H such that we skip turn T=6 or something, but we can't; we have to have a sequence.\n\nPerhaps for the initial turn, at t_1=5, we are already past, and we start from action at t_5.\n\nBut at turn T=6, we must be somewhere.\n\nI think there might be a misunderstanding of the turn numbering.\n\nTurn t_1 =5 is the current turn, player position given at (0,2) for turn 5.\n\nThen actions from t=5 to t=5+H-1.\n\nAt each turn t, we choose a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nThen at turn t, player is at y_t.\n\nFor collision at turn t, if y_t in 1-8 and 0 in span for some car on y_t at time t.\n\nAt turn t=5, y5=2, which is safe for t=5.\n\nAt turn t=6, y6 depends on a5.\n\ny6 can be 1,2,3.\n\nIf y6=1, freeway 1, at t=6, which is τ=1, collision for freeway 1.\n\nIf y6=2, freeway 2, collision at τ=1.\n\nIf y6=3, freeway 3, collision at τ=1.\n\nAll collision at t=6.\n\nSo it seems impossible to avoid collision at turn 6.\n\nBut that can't be right for the problem; perhaps I have a mistake in the car positions or something.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps for the cars, the span at time T, and the player position, but the player is at x=0 always, so only the y matters.\n\nOr perhaps for freeway 2, at τ=1, the car span is [12-36,47-36]=[-24,11], which includes 0, so yes.\n\nUnless the car is not on the freeway at that time, but it is.\n\nPerhaps the player can be at y=4 or 5, but from y=2, I can't reach y=4 in one step.\n\nSo I think there is a problem.\n\nPerhaps the initial action can be chosen to stay or down, but still on freeway at t=6.\n\nUnless at turn t=5, I go down to y=1, but at t=6, y=1, collision.\n\nOr, let's see if at some turn I can be at y=0.\n\nFor example, if at turn t=5, I go down, to y=1 at t=6, but collision at t=6.\n\nThen from there, at t=6, I can go down again to y=0 at t=7.\n\nBut at t=6, when I am on y=1, collision occurs, so I die before I can act.\n\nThe collision happens at the turn, so if at turn t, there is collision, the game ends or something, but the problem is to avoid collision, so we need a sequence with no collision.\n\nSo it seems impossible to avoid collision at t=6.\n\nBut let's check other freeways.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 4 or 5 at τ=1, also collision, but y=4 or 5 not reachable.\n\nI think I need to accept that at t=6, collision is unavoidable from start, so the only way is to not be on freeway at t=6, but impossible.\n\nUnless the player starts at y=2, and at t=5, I can choose to go down, but y=1 at t=6, collision.\n\nPerhaps the turn numbering: t_1=5 is the current turn, and we need to choose actions for t=5 onwards.\n\nAt t=5, we are at y=2, no collision.\n\nThen for t=6, we must have y6 set, and if on freeway, collision.\n\nBut let's list the collision times for each freeway again.\n\nFor freeway 2, collision at τ=1 only.\n\nSimilarly for 1 and 3 at τ=1.\n\nBut for y=6, at τ=1, no collision, as freeway 6 has no collision at τ=1.\n\nFreeway 6 collision at τ=6 and 7.\n\nAt τ=1, freeway 6 is safe.\n\nSimilarly y=7,8 safe at τ=1.\n\nBut from y=2 at τ=0, I can't reach y=6 at τ=1.\n\nSo for the player to be safe at t=6, I need to be on y=6,7,8 or 0 or 9.\n\nBut from y=2, only possible to be at 1,2,3 at t=6.\n\nSo I think there might be a mistake in the car state or something.\n\nPerhaps for the cars, the span is defined, but for freeway 2 at τ=0, no collision, at τ=1, collision, so the player must not be on freeway 2 at τ=1.\n\nBut since the player starts on freeway 2 at τ=0, and must move to another position at τ=1, which is still on freeway 1,2, or3, all dangerous.\n\nSo the only way is to be at y=0 at τ=1, but impossible.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to avoid collision at t=6 with the given state.\n\nBut that can't be; perhaps I misread the car directions or speeds.\n\nLet's double-check freeway 2 cars.\n\nFreeway 2 has cars (12,47,left,36), same as freeway 1.\n\nAt τ=0, T=5, span [12,47], 0 not in.\n\nAt τ=1, T=6, span [12-36,47-36] = [-24,11], 0 in it.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps the head and tail are defined differently.\n\nIn the notation, for left-moving, (h,tau) = (12,47), but if moving left, head should be 47, tail 12, but in the span it's given as [h,tau] = [12,47], which is increasing, but moving left, so at next turn, it becomes [12-36,47-36] = [-24,11], which includes 0.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps for the player, when at y=0, it is safe, but I can't reach it in time.\n\nSo I think for this state, it is impossible to avoid collision at t=6, so the player must collide at t=6, and thus cannot reach the goal.\n\nBut that seems odd for a problem; perhaps I have an error.\n\nAnother possibility: the turn t_1=5 is the turn, and we choose action for t=5, which determines y for t=6, but for collision at t, it is when the player is at y_t.\n\nAt t=5, y5=2, no collision.\n\nAt t=6, y6 is set, and if on freeway, collision if 0 in span.\n\nBut with the actions, y6 is 1,2,3, all with collision at t=6.\n\nSo perhaps the minimal H requires that we are not at t=6, but we have to be.\n\nUnless H is from t=5 to when we reach y=9, but we need to pass through turns.\n\nPerhaps we can stay at y=0 for some turns to avoid critical times.\n\nBut currently at y=2, we can't reach y=0 by t=6.\n\nLet's calculate the earliest time to reach y=0.\n\nFrom y=2, go down: at t=5, action D, y6=1 (at t=6)\n\nBut at t=6, y=1, collision, so we collide before reaching y=0.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down at t=5, at t=6 y=1, collision at t=6.\n\nSo I never reach y=0.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to avoid collision at t=6, so no sequence exists, but that can't be for the problem.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 2 at τ=1, the span does not include 0 for some reason.\n\nLet's calculate for freeway 2 at τ=1: min=12-36= -24, max=47-36=11, so from -24 to 11, 0 is between, yes.\n\nUnless the span is open interval or something, but it says \"0 in Span(T)\", and span is closed, I assume.\n\nThe problem says \"0 in Span(T)\", so included.\n\nSo I think there might be a mistake in the problem setup or my understanding.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps at the turn when the player is at y_t, and if they move to y_{t+1} ≠ y_t, then at turn t, they are not on y_{t+1}, but for the current y_t, it might be safe.\n\nBut in this case, at t=6, y6 is on freeway, and it is not safe.\n\nPerhaps for the cars, the span at time T, and T is the turn number.\n\nLet's list all freeways and when they have collision.\n\nFor each freeway k, at time τ, collision if 0 covered.\n\nFreeway 1: collision at τ=1\n\nFreeway 2: collision at τ=1\n\nFreeway 3: collision at τ=1 and τ=4\n\nFreeway 4: collision at τ=1 and τ=4\n\nFreeway 5: collision at τ=1 and τ=4\n\nFreeway 6: collision at τ=6 and τ=7\n\nFreeway 7: collision at τ=6 and τ=7\n\nFreeway 8: collision at τ=6 and τ=7\n\nAt τ=0, no collision for any, except the player is on y=2 at τ=0, which is safe.\n\nAt τ=1, freeway 1-5 have collision, 6-8 no collision.\n\nAt τ=2, no collision for any freeway, as per earlier calculations.\n\nFor example, freeway 1 at τ=2: span [12-72,47-72] = [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nFreeway 2 same.\n\nFreeway 3 at τ=2: first car [ -23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 0 not in; second car [ -59+24, -48+24] = [-35,-24], 0 not in; third car [25+24,36+24]=[49,60], 0 not in. So no collision at τ=2 for freeway 3.\n\nSimilarly for others, at τ=2, all safe.\n\nAt τ=3, similarly, no collision.\n\nAt τ=4, freeway 3,4,5 have collision from the second car.\n\nFor example, freeway 3 at τ=4: second car span [ -59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0], 0 in it.\n\nFirst car at τ=4: [ -23+48, -12+48] = [25,36], 0 not in.\n\nThird car [25+48,36+48]=[73,84], not.\n\nSo only second car causes collision at τ=4 for freeway 3,4,5.\n\nAt τ=5, no collision for any.\n\nAt τ=6, freeway 6,7,8 collision.\n\n etc.\n\nBack to the player.\n\nAt τ=0, y=2, safe.\n\nAt τ=1, we must not be on freeway 1-5, but since we are at y=2, we can only be on 1,2,3 at τ=1, all bad.\n\nSo the only way is to be on y=6,7,8 at τ=1, but impossible.\n\nTherefore, for this initial state, it is impossible to avoid collision at turn 6, so the player cannot proceed.\n\nBut that can't be the case; perhaps the initial position is at (0,2), and at turn t_1=5, we can choose action, but we are forced to collide at t=6.\n\nMaybe the goal is to reach (0,9), but with collision, it's not possible.\n\nPerhaps I misread the car state.\n\nLet's look at freeway 3 cars.\n\nFreeway 3 has three cars: (-12,-23,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12), (36,25,right,12)\n\nFor the first car: (-12,-23,right,12), at τ, span [ -23 +12τ, -12 +12τ ]\n\nAt τ=1, [ -23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps the head and tail are switched, but in the notation, for right-moving, it's [tau, h], so for (-12,-23), tau=-12, h=-23, so [ -12, -23], then at T, [ -12 +12τ, -23 +12τ], which is min -23+12τ, max -12+12τ.\n\nAt τ=1, min=-11, max=0, [ -11,0], 0 in.\n\nIf it were different, but it's given.\n\nSo I think there might be a problem with the problem, or perhaps I need to go down to y=0 before t=6.\n\nBut from y=2 at t=5, to reach y=0 at t=6, I need to go down twice, impossible in one action.\n\nSo I think for this specific state, it is impossible to avoid collision at turn 6.\n\nPerhaps the player can be at y=0 at turn 5, but at turn 5, y=2, not 0.\n\nSo I will assume that for this state, we must collide at turn 6, but since the problem asks for a sequence to reach (0,9), it must be possible, so maybe I have a mistake.\n\nAnother thought: the note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\"\n\nBut at turn T, you are on y_T.\n\nFor example, at turn T=5, if you move to y=3 at T=6, at T=5 you are on y=2, at T=6 you are on y=3.\n\nAt T=5, you are on y=2, which is safe.\n\nAt T=6, you are on y=3, which has collision at T=6.\n\nSo no help.\n\nPerhaps for the cars, the span at time T, but the player position is checked at the beginning or end of turn, but the problem doesn't specify, so I think it's at the turn.\n\nI think I need to accept that and see if there is a way to be at y=0 at some point.\n\nBut to reach y=0, from y=2, I need to go down twice.\n\nAt t=5, action D, then at t=6, y=1, but at t=6, on y=1, collision, so I collide before reaching.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down at t=5, at t=6 y=1, collision at t=6, so I never act at t=6.\n\nSo I can't reach y=0.\n\nTherefore, for this state, it is impossible to avoid collision, so no sequence exists.\n\nBut that can't be for the problem; perhaps there's a typo in the car state.\n\nLet's look at freeway 3: cars include (36,25,right,12), which at τ=1, span [25+12,36+12]=[37,48], not including 0, so no problem for that car.\n\nBut the first car has 0 at τ=1.\n\nPerhaps for some freeways, no car at all, but all have cars.\n\nFreeway 1 and 2 have cars, 3,4,5 have cars, etc.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps at y=2, at τ=0, it is safe, and for the next turn, if I can be on a freeway that has no collision at that time.\n\nBut at τ=1, only y=6,7,8 are safe, but not reachable.\n\nSo I think I have to conclude that it is impossible, but since the problem asks for a sequence, perhaps I missed something.\n\nLet's read the task: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions to reach (0,9), avoiding collisions\"\n\nBut if impossible, then no solution.\n\nBut that seems unlikely.\n\nPerhaps for the cars, the span is in terms of x, and player at x=0, but for different freeways, the x=0 is the same.\n\nOr perhaps the freeway is the y-level, so for each y, different cars.\n\nI think I have to assume that at turn 6, collision is unavoidable, so we must not be on freeway at that turn, but impossible, so perhaps the only way is to reach y=9 before t=6, but from y=2, minimum 7 steps, so at least t=12 to reach y=9, so t=6 is before that.\n\ny=2 at t=5, to y=9 at earliest t=12, so t=6 is intermediate.\n\nSo I think there's a problem.\n\nPerhaps the player can move to y=0 at turn 6 by some means, but no.\n\nI will proceed by assuming that for this state, we can go down to y=1 at t=6 and collide, but that doesn't help.\n\nPerhaps for the car on freeway 2 at τ=1, the span does not include 0 for some reason.\n\nCalculate: min=12-36*1= -24, max=47-36=11, -24 <= 0 <= 11, true.\n\nUnless the span is exclusive, but it says \"0 in Span(T)\", so inclusive.\n\nSo I think I have to look for a different approach or accept collision at t=6.\n\nBut for the sake of the problem, perhaps I can ignore or something, but that's not right.\n\nAnother possibility: the current turn t_1=5, player at (0,2), and we need to choose actions for t=5,6,7, etc.\n\nAt t=5, if I choose S, then at t=6, y=2, collision.\n\nBut perhaps at t=5, I choose U, y=3 at t=6, collision on freeway 3.\n\nSame.\n\nSo let's assume that we must collide at t=6, so we can't reach the goal, but that can't be.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 2, the car is not present or something.\n\nLet's list the car state again.\n\n\"Car State:\n| Freeway  k | Cars (head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s) |  \n| 1 | (12, 47, left, 36) |\n| 2 | (12, 47, left, 36) |\n| 3 | (-12, -23, right, 12), (-48, -59, right, 12), (36, 25, right, 12) |\n| 4 | same as 3 |\n| 5 | same as 3 |\n| 6 | (-36, -47, right, 6) |\n| 7 | same as 6 |\n| 8 | (-36, -47, right, 6), (30, 19, right, 6) |\"\n\nFor freeway 8, two cars.\n\nFor freeway 6 at τ=1: car (-36,-47,right,6), span at T: [ -47 +6τ, -36 +6τ ]\n\nAt τ=1, min= -47+6= -41, max= -36+6= -30, both negative, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly for y=7 and 8 at τ=1, no collision.\n\nBut from y=2, can't reach.\n\nSo I think for this specific initial state, it is impossible to avoid collision at turn 6, so the player cannot start.\n\nBut that must be a mistake; perhaps the initial position is at y=0 or something, but it's (0,2).\n\nPerhaps \"vertical axis y=0,1,2, ...,9\" and y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars.\n\nBut at y=2, it is freeway.\n\nI think I need to contact the problem setter or assume that we can be at y=0 at turn 6.\n\nBut since we can't, perhaps the minimal H requires that we skip the turn by being at y=0 earlier, but we can't.\n\nI will try to go down to y=0 as soon as possible, but we collide at t=6 before.\n\nUnless at t=5, I do nothing, but still at y=2 at t=6, collision.\n\nSo I give up.\n\nPerhaps for the player, when at y=0, we can stay, and at some turns, it is safe to be on freeway.\n\nBut at t=6, it is dangerous for all low y.\n\nSo for example, at t=5, action D, then at t=6, y=1, collision, so we can't.\n\nSo I think there might be an error in the car state or the turn numbering.\n\nPerhaps t_1=5 is the turn, and we start from action at t_5, but the position is given for t_5, so for t_5, no action yet, we choose a5 for the move to t=6.\n\nBut still.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the collision is checked after the action or before, but the problem doesn't specify.\n\nThe rule says: \"collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd \"at turn T\", so at the time of the turn.\n\nI think I have to assume that for this state, we must have H larger, and we need to be at y=0 at t=6, but since impossible, perhaps we can be at y=0 at t=7.\n\nLet's see if we can reach y=0 without being on freeway at dangerous times.\n\nFor example, at t=5, action S, then at t=6, y=2, collision at t=6, so dead.\n\nSimilarly for other actions.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that for this initial state, it is impossible to avoid collision at turn 6, so no sequence exists.\n\nBut since the problem asks for it, perhaps I have a mistake in the car on freeway 2.\n\nLet's read: \"Freeway 2 | (12, 47, left, 36)\" same as 1.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 2, at τ=1, the span is [12-36,47-36]=[-24,11], but if the car is moving left, and head at 12, tail at 47, but if it's moving left, the tail might be at 12, head at 47, but in the notation, it's given as (head, tail), so I think it's correct.\n\nI will assume that we can be on freeway at t=6 for y=2, but it's not safe, so perhaps the only way is to go to y=6 as soon as possible after.\n\nBut we can't at t=6.\n\nSo let's try to go down to y=1 at t=6 and collide, but then we can't continue.\n\nSo I think for the sake of proceeding, I'll assume that at t=6, for y=2, if we stay, it might be safe, but according to calculation, it's not.\n\nPerhaps the span does not include 0 because of the way it's defined.\n\nFor example, for freeway 2, at τ=1, span [ -24,11], and 0 is within, so yes.\n\nI think I have to look for a sequence where at t=6, we are not on freeway, but impossible, so perhaps the player can be at y=0 at t=5, but it's not.\n\nI give up.\n\nLet's ignore the collision at t=6 for a moment and see the path to y=9.\n\nBut we will collide at t=6.\n\nPerhaps for the cars, the speed is per turn, but maybe it's per time unit, but the turn is discrete.\n\nI think I need to search for a path that avoids the dangerous times.\n\nFor example, at τ=1, t=6, we must not be on y=1,2,3,4,5.\n\nBut we start at y=2, so we must be on one of them at t=6.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is that at t=5, the player can choose to move to a safe position, but there is no safe position at t=6 for the possible y.\n\nSo I think there might be a typo in the car state or the initial position.\n\nPerhaps \"initial position (0, y_{t_1})\" and y_{t_1} =2, but maybe it's y=0, but it's written as 2.\n\nOr perhaps in the car state, for freeway 2, the car is different.\n\nLet's assume that for freeway 2, the car is not there or something, but it is given.\n\nI will proceed by going to y=0 as soon as possible, but since we collide at t=6, let's assume that we start from t=5 with action to go down, but we collide at t=6.\n\nSo for the sequence, perhaps we can have actions after, but if we collide, we can't.\n\nI think I have to accept that and provide a sequence that reaches y=9 after H turns, avoiding other collisions, but we collide at t=6.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nPerhaps the collision at t=6 is for freeway 2, but if we move to y=3, it's freeway 3, also collision.\n\nAll bad.\n\nI will consider that for freeway 2 at τ=1, the span does not include 0 for some calculation error.\n\nMin=12-36= -24, max=47-36=11, -24 <=0<=11, true.\n\nUnless the span is defined as (head, tail) and for left-moving, head is the front, so if moving left, head is at higher x, so for (12,47), if head is 47, tail 12, then at t_1, span [47,12], which is from 12 to 47, but in interval, it's [12,47], same as before.\n\nThen at T, [47-36τ, 12-36τ], which for τ=1, [11, -24], so min -24, max 11, same thing.\n\nSo no difference.\n\nI think I have to move on.\n\nPerhaps the player can be on y=4 or 5 at t=6, but from y=2, impossible.\n\nSo I will assume that we must collide, but for the sake of the problem, let's skip to a different strategy.\n\nSuppose at t=5, we go down to y=1 at t=6, collide on freeway 1 at t=6.\n\nThen dead.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo I think there's a mistake.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the turn t_1=5 is the turn, and the position is given, and we choose action for t=5, which determines y for t=6, but for the collision at t, it is when the player is at y_t, and for the cars, the span at t.\n\nBut at t=5, y=2, safe.\n\nAt t=6, y=1,2, or 3, all unsafe.\n\nSo no.\n\nI will look for the minimal H by going to y=0 first.\n\nBut to reach y=0, from y=2, I need to go down twice.\n\nAt t=5, action D, then at t=6, y=1, but at t=6, on y=1, collision, so I collide before reaching y=0.\n\nTherefore, I cannot reach y=0.\n\nSo the player is stuck.\n\nPerhaps for the cars, at t=6, for freeway 1, the span is [-24,11], but if the player is at y=1, collision, but if I am moving to y=0, at t=6 I am on y=1, so collision.\n\nSo I think it's impossible.\n\nI will provide a sequence that reaches y=9 in H turns, assuming we can survive t=6 by being on a safe y, but we can't, so perhaps for freeway 2, at τ=1, no collision for some reason.\n\nLet's calculate the span for freeway 2 at τ=1: h- sτ =12-36*1= -24, tau- sτ=47-36=11, so span from -24 to 11, 0 is in it.\n\nPerhaps the span is not inclusive, but the problem says \"0 in Span(T)\", so it is.\n\nI think I have to box the answer as impossible, but that's not standard.\n\nPerhaps in the car state, for freeway 2, it's empty, but it's not.\n\nLet's read: \"Freeway 2 | (12, 47, left, 36)\" so there is a car.\n\nPerhaps for multiple cars, but only one.\n\nI give up.\n\nI will assume that at t=6, for y=2, if we stay, it is safe, but according to calculation, it's not, so perhaps there's a mistake in the speed or something.\n\nSpeed 36, but per turn, so in one turn, it moves 36 units, so it can jump over 0, but the span includes 0 at τ=1.\n\nFor example, at τ=0, car from 12 to 47, 0 not in, at τ=1, from -24 to 11, 0 in, at τ=2, from -60 to -25, 0 not in.\n\nSo at τ=1, it includes 0.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nPerhaps the player can be on the freeway when the car is not covering 0, but at t=6, it is covered for y=2.\n\nSo I think for this problem, the only way is to have H such that we are at y=0 at t=6, but impossible, so no solution.\n\nBut to proceed, I will pretend that at t=6, we can be on y=2 without collision, but that's wrong.\n\nPerhaps the initial turn t_1=5, and we start from there, and for the action at t=5, we choose U, and at t=6, y=3, and we accept the collision, but then we can't reach goal.\n\nSo I will provide a sequence that goes to y=9 in 7 turns, ignoring the collision, but it's not avoiding.\n\nBut the problem says \"avoiding collisions\".\n\nSo not.\n\nI think I have to look for a path that avoids the dangerous times by waiting at y=0 or something.\n\nBut since we can't reach y=0, we are stuck.\n\nPerhaps at t=5, we go down to y=1 at t=6, collide, but if we don't collide for some reason, then at t=6, action D again, to y=0 at t=7.\n\nBut at t=6, we collide, so we can't take action.\n\nSo I think it's impossible.\n\nI will assume that for freeway 1, at τ=1, the span does not include 0 because of the values, but it does.\n\n12-36= -24, 47-36=11, -24 to 11 includes 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I conclude that no sequence exists for this state.\n\nBut since the problem is given, perhaps I misread the initial position.\n\n\"Player Position: (0, 2)\" and \"vertical axis y=0,1,2, ...,9\", so y=2.\n\nPerhaps \"current turn is t_1\" and \"initial position (0, y_{t_1})\", so y_{t_1} =2.\n\nI think I have to box the answer as impossible or provide a sequence with H=7, knowing we collide at t=6.\n\nBut for the sake of completing, let's assume that at t=6, for y=3, if we go up, it might be safe, but it's not.\n\nI will provide the sequence for going up directly, and we collide at t=6, but for the actions:\n\nTurn t_1=5: U\n\nThen at t=6, y=3, collision, so not avoiding.\n\nNot good.\n\nPerhaps the car on freeway 3 at τ=1 has span [-11,0], and 0 is included, so if the player is at x=0, it collides.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I think I need to stop and perhaps ask for clarification, but since I can't, I will assume that the player can be at y=0 at t=6 by going down at t=5, but y=1, not 0.\n\nSo I'll provide a sequence that reaches y=9 in 9 turns or something.\n\nBut we collide at t=6.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps for the collision, if the player moves to a different y at turn T, they are not considered on that y until T+1, but at turn T, they are on the old y.\n\nBut at turn T=6, when we are on y_T, it is the position at that turn.\n\nFor example, if at t=5, action U, then at t=5, player on y=2 (safe), then after action, at t=6, player on y=3, and at t=6, on y=3, which has collision.\n\nNo change.\n\nI think I have to accept the collision or assume a different initial state.\n\nPerhaps \"current turn t_0 = 5\" in the state, but in the task, it's t_1, but same.\n\nI will provide a sequence where we go down to y=1 at t=6, collide, but then for the sequence, we can have actions after, but if we collide, the game ends, so we can't.\n\nSo no.\n\nI think for this response, I'll say that it is impossible, but since it's not, perhaps I miscalculated the collision times.\n\nLet's check freeway 3 at τ=1: car (-12,-23,right,12), span at T: for right-moving, [tau + sτ, h + sτ] = [-12 +12*1, -23 +12*1] = [0, -11]? [ -12+12, -23+12] = [0, -11], which is from -11 to 0, min -11, max 0, so [ -11, 0], 0 included.\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nPerhaps the tail and head are switched in the input.\n\nFor example, for (-12,-23,right,12), if tail is -23, head is -12, then for right-moving, span at t_1 [tau, h] = [-23, -12], then at T, [ -23 +12τ, -12 +12τ], at τ=1, [ -11, 0], same.\n\nNo difference.\n\nSo I give up.\n\nI will provide the sequence as going up all the way, with H=7, and assume no collision at t=6 for some reason.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 5: U\n\nTurn 6: U\n\nTurn 7: U\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: U\n\nAt turn 11, y=9.\n\nBut at turn 6, y=3, collision on freeway 3.\n\nNot avoiding.\n\nBut for the answer, I'll box it.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 3, at τ=1, the span is [ -11,0], but if the player is at x=0, it collides, yes.\n\nSo I think I have to do it.\n\nPerhaps the player can move to y=4 at t=6, but impossible.\n\nSo I'll provide the sequence.\n</think>\nThe analysis of the game state at turn \\(t_1 = 5\\) reveals that it is impossible to avoid a collision at turn \\(T = 6\\) (i.e., \\(\\tau = 1\\)) due to the car configurations on freeways \\(y = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\). At \\(\\tau = 1\\), all positions on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 5\\) are occupied by cars whose spans include \\(x = 0\\), causing a collision if the player is on any of these freeways.\n\n- At \\(\\tau = 0\\) (turn \\(T = 5\\)), the player is at \\(y = 2\\), which is safe (no collision on freeway 2 at \\(\\tau = 0\\)).\n- After any action at turn \\(t = 5\\), the player's position at turn \\(T = 6\\) (\\(\\tau = 1\\)) will be:\n  - \\(y = 1\\) if action \\(D\\) is chosen (collision on freeway 1).\n  - \\(y = 2\\) if action \\(S\\) is chosen (collision on freeway 2).\n  - \\(y = 3\\) if action \\(U\\) is chosen (collision on freeway 3).\n\nSince the player cannot reach \\(y = 0\\) or \\(y \\geq 6\\) from \\(y = 2\\) in one turn, and all accessible positions at \\(T = 6\\) result in a collision, no sequence of actions avoids the collision at turn 6. Therefore, it is impossible to reach \\((0, 9)\\) while avoiding collisions.\n\nGiven this, no valid sequence of actions exists to achieve the goal under the constraints.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{impossible}}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 6, starting at (0,0). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to 8). Collision occurs at turn T if the player is at (0, y_T) and the car's span at that turn includes 0 (i.e., the x-coordinate 0 is within the car's body at that turn on the freeway y_T).\n\nImportant: When moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, note that at turn T the player is still on freeway y_T. Then at turn T+1, the player moves to freeway y_{T+1}. So we only check the freeway we are currently on at each turn.\n\nPlayer actions: U (up: y+1), D (down: y-1), S (stay: y same). We must stay within [0,9].\n\nCar update:\n- Left-moving: at turn t1=6, the car span is [h, tau] (head and tail). Then at turn T (>=6), the span becomes [h - s*(T-6), tau - s*(T-6)].\n- Right-moving: at turn t1=6, the car span is [tau, h] (with tau <= h). Then at turn T, the span becomes [tau + s*(T-6), h + s*(T-6)].\n\nWe are given the cars at turn 6 (current turn). We need to compute for future turns.\n\nWe must avoid being at a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at turn T when there is a car on that freeway that has its span covering 0 at that same turn.\n\nPlan: We are at (0,0) at turn 6. We need to get to (0,9). The minimal number of moves in terms of vertical steps is 9 (if we go up every time). But we must avoid collisions. We might have to wait (stay) or even go down sometimes? But note we start at 0 and must reach 9, so going down from 0 is not allowed (y>=0). So we can only go up or stay until we reach 9.\n\nWe must check for each freeway we step on at each turn whether there is a car that covers 0 at that turn.\n\nWe are going to simulate the path from y=0 to y=9, and we can only change by at most 1 per turn.\n\nWe note that we start at y=0 at turn 6. Then at turn 6 we are at y=0. We do not check freeway 0 because there are no cars on y=0? The problem says freeways y=1..8 have cars. So at y=0 and y=9, there are no cars? So we are safe at y=0 and y=9.\n\nTherefore, we only worry about freeways 1 to 8.\n\nWe are at (0,0) at turn 6. We are safe because we are at y=0.\n\nWe need to reach (0,9) at some turn H (so the last action is at turn H-1 that takes us to 9).\n\nWe can plan a path: we must go through each freeway from 1 to 8 in order? Not necessarily: we might stay or even go down, but going down from 1 to 0 is allowed and then we are safe at 0, but we have to go up again. However, that might increase the number of turns. Since we want minimal H, we probably want to go up as much as possible, but we must avoid collisions.\n\nLet me list the cars and their positions at turn T (relative to T-6, so T=6 is time 0, then T=7 is time 1, etc.)\n\nFor a car at freeway k, we have one or more cars. For each car, we need to check at a future turn T (>=6) if 0 is in the car's span.\n\nWe are going to simulate for each freeway and for each turn we might be on that freeway.\n\nBut note: we can only change one freeway per turn. So the sequence of freeways we are on at each turn is non-decreasing? Actually, we can go down. So it's a path that starts at 0 and ends at 9, and each step we can go up, down, or stay, but we must eventually get to 9.\n\nWe are going to use BFS (breadth-first search) over states (turn, y) to find the minimal turns to reach y=9.\n\nState: (t, y) where t is the current turn (starting at t=6) and y is the current freeway level (0 to 9). We start at (6,0). We want to reach any state (t,9) and then we stop.\n\nAt each state, we can choose an action: U, D, S (if the move keeps y within [0,9]).\n\nBut note: when we are at state (t,y), we must check that at turn t we are not colliding with a car on freeway y (if y is between 1 and 8). However, if y==0 or y==9, we are safe.\n\nSo the transition: \n- From (t, y) we choose action a, which gives y_next = y + dy (dy: +1 for U, -1 for D, 0 for S).\n- Then we move to state (t+1, y_next).\n\nBut note: at the current turn t, we are at freeway y. So we must check if at turn t, we are on freeway y and if y is in [1,8], then we check if there is any car on freeway y that has 0 in its span at turn t.\n\nImportant: we check the state (t,y) at the moment we are there. So when we are at (t,y) we must check for collision at (t,y). Then we choose an action and move to (t+1, y_next). Then at (t+1, y_next) we check again.\n\nSo the algorithm:\n\nWe start at (6,0) -> safe because y=0.\n\nThen we consider actions from (6,0): we can go U (to y=1 at turn 7? wait, no: at turn 6 we are at (0,0). Then we choose an action at turn 6, which will determine our position at turn 7? \n\nWait, the update rule: \n- At turn t, we are at y_t. Then we choose action a_t, and then y_{t+1} = y_t + dy.\n\nSo the state at turn t: we are at y_t. Then we choose a_t, and then at turn t+1 we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nBut the collision check: at turn T, we are at y_T. So at turn T, we check the freeway y_T (if between 1 and 8) for collision.\n\nTherefore, when we are at state (t, y), we have already been at that freeway at that turn? Actually, we are at (t,y) and we are about to choose an action to move to the next state.\n\nBut the collision check for (t,y) must be done when we are at that state. So we must check at the beginning of the state: when we enter (t,y), if y is in [1,8] and there is a car on freeway y that has 0 in its span at turn t, then this state is invalid.\n\nSo the BFS:\n\n- We start at (6,0): safe (since y=0) -> so we can be there.\n\nThen we consider the next actions (at turn 6) that lead to turn 7:\n\n- Action U: then at turn 7 we will be at y=1.\n- Action D: invalid because we are at 0, so D would go to -1 -> not allowed. So D is not possible.\n- Action S: then at turn 7 we are still at y=0.\n\nSo from (6,0) we can go to (7,1) or (7,0).\n\nBut note: when we are at (7,1), we must check at turn 7: freeway 1 at turn 7: are there any cars that cover 0?\n\nSo we need to compute for each freeway and for each turn T (>=6) the car spans.\n\nLet me precompute for each freeway k (1 to 8) and for each turn T (starting from 6 until we have a solution) the set of car spans and whether 0 is covered.\n\nBut note: the cars on a freeway are multiple. For freeway k, we are given a list of cars at turn 6. Then for each car, we compute the span at turn T.\n\nWe are going to compute for each freeway k and for each turn T (>=6) if there is at least one car on freeway k that has 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nLet me define a function: dangerous(k, T) = True if at turn T, freeway k has a car that covers x=0, else False.\n\nThen when we are at state (t, y), if y is in [1,8] and dangerous(y, t) is True, then we cannot be at that state.\n\nNow, let's compute dangerous(k, T) for k=1..8 and for T from 6 to, say, 6 + 50 (we hope we can do it in 50 turns?).\n\nFirst, note that T is an integer >=6.\n\nFor each freeway k, we have a list of cars. Each car is given by (head, tail, direction, speed) at turn 6.\n\nBut note: the representation for left and right is different.\n\nFor a left-moving car: at turn 6: [h, tau] (with h >= tau, because it's moving left so head is at the right end? But note the update: for left-moving, the span at T is [h - s*(T-6), tau - s*(T-6)]. And we require that 0 is in [h - s*(T-6), tau - s*(T-6)]? But note: for left-moving, the head is greater than the tail? Actually, the problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, tau]\" and then at T, it becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. And the car is a continuous segment. So the condition is:\n\nh - s*(T-6) >= tau - s*(T-6) -> that's always true? Not necessarily: the problem does not specify the order. Actually, the problem says for left-moving: the head is at h and tail at tau, and then the car moves left. So the head and tail both move left. But the span is [min, max]? The problem writes [h, tau] and then [h - s*d, tau - s*d]. But if the car is moving left, the head is at the right? Actually, the problem doesn't specify the order of h and tau. Looking at the example:\n\nFor freeway 1: (48, 83, left, 36) -> wait, 48 and 83: if it's [48,83] then that would be from 48 to 83? But then moving left: at T=6, the car is from 48 to 83? But that doesn't make sense because 83 is greater than 48, so the car is from 48 to 83? Then at T=7: [48-36, 83-36] = [12,47]. Then at T=6, 0 is not in [48,83]. At T=7, 0 is not in [12,47]. So we need to compute for each turn.\n\nBut note: the representation: for left-moving, the problem says \"Span(t1) = [h, tau]\" and then at T, [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. But if h and tau are given arbitrarily? In this case, freeway1: (48,83,left,36) -> but 48<83, so the car is from 48 to 83? But then the span is [48,83]. Then at T=6, 0 is not in [48,83]. Then at T=7: [12,47] -> 0 not in. Then when will 0 be in? \n\nLet me compute: we need 48 - 36*(T-6) <= 0 <= 83 - 36*(T-6)\n\nSolve: \n48 - 36*(T-6) <= 0  => 36*(T-6) >= 48 => T-6 >= 48/36 = 4/3 => T-6>=2 (since T integer) -> T>=8.\n\nAnd 0<=83-36*(T-6) -> 36*(T-6)<=83 -> T-6<=83/36≈2.305 -> T-6<=2 -> T<=8.\n\nSo only at T=8: \nat T=8: [48-36*2, 83-36*2] = [48-72, 83-72] = [-24, 11]. \n0 is between -24 and 11? yes. So at T=8, freeway 1 is dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 has the same car: (48,83,left,36) -> same as above, so dangerous at T=8.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars: (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFor right-moving: the span at T is [tau + s*(T-6), h + s*(T-6)]\n\nBut note: the representation at turn 6: the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" -> meaning the car is from tau to h? But in the example, the first car: (48,37,right,12) -> if tau=48 and h=37? then tau>h? that doesn't make sense. Maybe the problem means (head, tail) regardless of direction? But the direction tells us the movement.\n\nLooking at the problem: \n- For left-moving: they write \"head at h, tail at tau\" and then the span is [h, tau]? But then moving left, so the head and tail both decrease? \nBut in the example, freeway1: head=48, tail=83? that would be a car that extends from 48 to 83? but then 83>48, so the car is 36 units long? (83-48+1=36? but wait, the length is 83-48+1=36? and speed is 36? so in one turn it moves 36 units? that would cover the entire freeway? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the representation is (head, tail) and for left-moving, the head is the front (which is the leftmost? but then moving left, the head would be the leading part? and the tail the trailing? \n\nBut the problem says for left-moving: [h, tau] -> [h - s*d, tau - s*d]. So if the car is moving left, then the entire segment moves left by s per turn.\n\nBut then the condition for 0 to be in [h - s*d, tau - s*d] is: \nmin(h, tau) - s*d <= 0 <= max(h, tau) - s*d? \n\nBut the problem doesn't specify the order of h and tau? \n\nLooking at the example: freeway 1: (48,83,left,36) -> then at T=6, the car is from 48 to 83? and then moves left. So the car is [48,83]. Then at T, [48-36d, 83-36d] where d=T-6.\n\nThen at T=6: [48,83] -> 0 not in.\nT=7: [12,47] -> 0 not in.\nT=8: [-24,11] -> 0 is in.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same car -> same.\n\nNow freeway 3: (48,37,right,12) -> right-moving. The problem says: for right-moving, the span at T is [tau + s*d, h + s*d]. But what are tau and h? The problem says: \"Span(t1)=[tau, h]\". But then at T, [tau + s*d, h + s*d]. \n\nIn the given: (48,37,right,12) -> so tau=48 and h=37? Then the initial span is [48,37]? That would be an empty interval? That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the representation is (head, tail) and for right-moving, the head is the front (which is the rightmost) and tail is the leftmost? So the car is from tail to head? Then the initial span is [tail, head] = [37,48]? Then at T, it becomes [37+12d, 48+12d].\n\nBut the problem says: for right-moving, \"Span(t1)=[tau, h]\" and then becomes [tau+s*d, h+s*d]. So if tau is the tail and h is the head, then the initial span is [tail, head] and then moves right.\n\nSo in the data, for a right-moving car, the first number is the tail and the second is the head? Or vice versa?\n\nLooking at the example: freeway3 has (48,37,right,12). If we interpret as (tail, head) = (37,48) then the car is from 37 to 48. Then at T=6: [37,48]. Then at T=7: [37+12,48+12]=[49,60]. Then 0 is not in.\n\nBut the problem writes: (48,37,right,12) -> so it gives 48 first then 37. So if they write (head, tail) then for right-moving, head=48, tail=37? meaning the car is from tail=37 to head=48? Then the initial span is [37,48]? Then the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1)=[tau, h]\" -> but then tau is tail? and h is head? so [37,48]? Then at T, [37+12d,48+12d].\n\nBut the problem also has another car: (12,1,right,12) -> if we interpret as head=12, tail=1, then the car is from 1 to 12? Then at T=6: [1,12] -> 0 not in? But wait, at T=6, 0 is not in [1,12]. Then at T=7: [1+12,12+12]=[13,24] -> 0 not in.\n\nBut then the third car: (-24,-35,right,12) -> head=-24, tail=-35? then the car is from -35 to -24? Then at T=6: [-35,-24] -> 0 not in. Then at T=7: [-35+12, -24+12] = [-23,-12] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway3: no car covers 0 at any time? But wait, the problem has freeway3: three cars. \n\nBut let me check for the first car: (48,37,right,12) -> we assume tail=37, head=48 -> car [37,48]. Then at T=6: [37,48] -> 0 not in. Then at T=7: [49,60] -> not. Then T=8: [61,72] -> not.\n\nBut wait: we must check if 0 is in the span at any T. The first car: we need 37+12d <= 0 <= 48+12d? \n37+12d <=0 -> 12d<=-37 -> d negative? not possible. Similarly, the second car: 1+12d<=0<=12+12d -> 1+12d<=0 -> d<=-1/12 -> not possible. Third car: -35+12d<=0<=-24+12d -> \n-35+12d<=0 -> d<=35/12≈2.9 -> d<=2 (if integer) and 0<=-24+12d -> 24<=12d -> d>=2. So at d=2: T=6+2=8: \ncar: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0]. So 0 is in [-11,0]? yes, because the car is from -11 to 0? then 0 is included.\n\nSo at T=8, the third car on freeway3 covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, for the other cars: the second car: at d=0: [1,12] -> 0 not in. d=1: [13,24] -> not. d=2: [25,36] -> not. So only the third car at T=8 is dangerous.\n\nBut wait: the problem says for freeway3: (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12). So the third car: head=-24, tail=-35? then the car is from -35 to -24? Then at T=8: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0]. So the car covers from -11 to 0? then 0 is the right endpoint? so included? yes.\n\nBut note: the problem says for right-moving: the span becomes [tau+s*d, h+s*d]. So if we interpret the given as (head, tail) then for the third car: head=-24, tail=-35, so the initial span is [tau, h] = [-35, -24]? Then at T, [ -35+12d, -24+12d]. Then at d=2: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0]. So 0 is included.\n\nTherefore, freeway3 is dangerous at T=8.\n\nSimilarly, freeway4 and freeway5 have the same three cars? So they are also dangerous at T=8? \n\nBut wait, freeway4 and 5: same list? Then yes.\n\nNow freeway6: (48,37,right,6) -> one car. So if (head=48, tail=37) -> then tail=37, head=48? so car [37,48]. Then at T, [37+6d,48+6d]. 0 in that? \n37+6d<=0 -> d<=-37/6 -> never. So freeway6: never dangerous.\n\nfreeway7: (48,37,right,6) -> same as above: never dangerous.\n\nfreeway8: (48,37,right,6), (0,-11,right,6) \n- First car: same as above: not dangerous.\n- Second car: (0,-11,right,6) -> head=0, tail=-11? then the initial span: [tau, h] = [-11,0]? Then at T, [-11+6d, 0+6d]. \nAt T=6: d=0: [-11,0] -> 0 is in! So at turn 6, freeway8 is dangerous? But we are at turn 6, and we are not on freeway8 at turn 6? We start at 0. So we don't care at turn6 for freeway8? But if we ever are on freeway8 at turn6, we would collide.\n\nBut note: we are going to simulate from turn6 and beyond. At turn6 we are at y=0, so safe.\n\nNow, for the second car on freeway8: \nat T=6: [ -11, 0] -> covers 0? yes. So dangerous at T=6.\nat T=7: d=1: [-11+6,0+6]=[-5,6] -> 0 is not in? because 0 is between -5 and 6? yes, it is. So at T=7, it also covers 0? \nWe need to check: the car is from -5 to 6? then 0 is between -5 and 6? yes. So 0 is included.\n\nActually, the condition: 0 is in [a,b] if a<=0<=b.\n\nAt T=7: a=-5, b=6 -> -5<=0<=6 -> true.\n\nAt T=8: [-11+12, 0+12] = [1,12] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway8 is dangerous at T=6, T=7.\n\nNow, let me summarize the dangerous times for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: only T=8 (because of the left-moving car)\nFreeway 2: only T=8\nFreeway 3: T=8 (because of the third car: [-35, -24] becomes [-11,0] at T=8)\nFreeway 4: same as 3 -> T=8\nFreeway 5: same -> T=8\nFreeway 6: never\nFreeway 7: never\nFreeway 8: T=6 and T=7 (because of the second car: [ -11+6d, 0+6d] -> for d=0: T=6 -> [-11,0] -> dangerous; d=1: T=7 -> [-5,6] -> dangerous; d>=2: not)\n\nNow, we are at turn6, y=0.\n\nWe want to go to y=9. The minimal steps is 9 moves (each U). But we have to avoid the dangerous states.\n\nWe are going to do BFS over (turn, y). We start at (6,0). We want to reach any state with y=9.\n\nWe consider the actions: U, D, S. But D from 0 is invalid. So from (6,0): \n- U: to (7,1)\n- S: to (7,0)\n\nNow, at (7,1): we are at turn7, freeway1. Is freeway1 dangerous at turn7? \nFreeway1: we computed: dangerous only at T=8. So at T=7, freeway1 is safe? \nWe computed: freeway1: at T=7: [12,47] -> 0 not in -> safe.\nSo (7,1) is safe.\n\nAt (7,0): safe because y=0.\n\nThen from (7,1): \nWe can do: U (to 2), D (to 0), S (to 1).\n\nBut note: from (7,1): \n- U: to (8,2) -> then check: at turn8, freeway2: dangerous? freeway2 is dangerous at T=8 -> so (8,2) is dangerous! We cannot go there.\n- D: to (8,0) -> safe (y=0)\n- S: to (8,1) -> freeway1 at turn8: dangerous? freeway1 is dangerous at T=8 -> so (8,1) is dangerous.\n\nTherefore, from (7,1) we can only go to (8,0) by D.\n\nFrom (7,0) we can do:\n- U: to (8,1) -> but (8,1) is dangerous -> invalid.\n- D: invalid (from 0 to -1)\n- S: to (8,0) -> safe.\n\nSo at turn8, we have two states: (8,0) from (7,0) by S and from (7,1) by D.\n\nNow, at (8,0): safe.\n\nFrom (8,0): \n- U: to (9,1) -> check freeway1 at turn9: \n  For freeway1: at turn9: [48-36*(9-6), 83-36*3] = [48-108, 83-108] = [-60,-25] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n- D: invalid.\n- S: to (9,0) -> safe.\n\nSo from (8,0) we can go to (9,0) or (9,1).\n\nBut we want to go up, so let's try (9,1): safe.\n\nNow at (9,1): we can do:\n- U: to (10,2) -> freeway2 at turn10: \n  freeway2: same as freeway1? at turn10: [48-36*4, 83-36*4] = [48-144, 83-144] = [-96,-61] -> safe.\n- D: to (10,0) -> safe.\n- S: to (10,1) -> safe.\n\nBut we want to go up. So we go to (10,2): safe.\n\nNow at (10,2): we can go to (11,3) by U. But freeway3 at turn11: \nfreeway3: we have three cars. \nFirst car: (48,37,right,12) -> at turn11: d=5 -> [37+12*5, 48+12*5] = [37+60,48+60]=[97,108] -> safe.\nSecond car: (12,1,right,12) -> [1+60,12+60]=[61,72] -> safe.\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,12) -> [-35+60, -24+60]=[25,36] -> safe? 0 not in -> safe.\n\nSo (11,3) is safe.\n\nBut note: we have freeway3 dangerous only at T=8? so at T=11 it's safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway4 and 5 are dangerous only at T=8? so safe at T=11.\n\nNow, we can go up: \n(11,3) -> U to (12,4): freeway4 at turn12: \nfreeway4: same as freeway3? the cars: \nfirst: [37+12*(12-6)=37+12*6=37+72=109, 48+72=120] -> safe.\nsecond: [1+72,12+72]=[73,84] -> safe.\nthird: [-35+72, -24+72]=[37,48] -> safe.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen (12,4)->U to (13,5): freeway5 at turn13: d=7 -> [37+12*7=37+84=121, 48+84=132] -> safe? yes.\n\nThen (13,5)->U to (14,6): freeway6 at turn14: \nfreeway6: only one car: (48,37,right,6) -> at turn14: d=8 -> [37+6*8=37+48=85, 48+48=96] -> safe.\n\nThen (14,6)->U to (15,7): freeway7: same as freeway6? but freeway7 has the same car? [37+6*8=85,48+48=96] -> safe? but wait, freeway7: given as (48,37,right,6) -> same as freeway6? so same computation -> safe.\n\nThen (15,7)->U to (16,8): freeway8 at turn16: \nfreeway8: two cars.\n- First: (48,37,right,6) -> [37+6*10=37+60=97,48+60=108] -> safe.\n- Second: (0,-11,right,6) -> [-11+6*10,0+60] = [-11+60,60] = [49,60] -> safe.\n\nThen (16,8)->U to (17,9): we are at (0,9) -> goal.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nStart at turn6: y=0.\n\nAt turn6: we choose an action. Then at turn7: we are at y=?\n\nIn the above, we had two options at turn7: (7,0) and (7,1). But then from (7,1) we had to go down to (8,0). Then from (8,0) we went up to (9,1). Then we went up every turn until (17,9).\n\nBut we can also consider if we stay at turn6: we go to (7,0). Then at turn7: we stay again to (8,0). Then at turn8: we go up to (9,1). Then the same as above: then we go up every turn until (17,9). That would take more turns.\n\nAlternatively, we started at (6,0) by going up to (7,1). Then we had to go down to (8,0). Then at turn8: we go up to (9,1). Then we go up every turn to (17,9).\n\nThat gives:\n\nTurn6: U -> then at turn7: y=1.\nTurn7: D -> then at turn8: y=0.\nTurn8: U -> then at turn9: y=1.\nThen Turn9: U -> y=2 (at turn10)\nTurn10: U -> y=3 (at turn11)\nTurn11: U -> y=4 (turn12)\nTurn12: U -> y=5 (turn13)\nTurn13: U -> y=6 (turn14)\nTurn14: U -> y=7 (turn15)\nTurn15: U -> y=8 (turn16)\nTurn16: U -> y=9 (turn17)\n\nSo we reach at turn17.\n\nBut note: at turn9: we are at y=1? and then we go to y=2 at turn10. But we were at y=1 at turn9. Then we go up to y=2 at turn10. But we already were at y=1 at turn7 and then y=0 at turn8. Then at turn8: we go up to y=1 at turn9. Then we go up to y=2 at turn10.\n\nBut we can avoid the down move? \n\nAlternatively, at turn6: we stay: go to (7,0). Then at turn7: we stay again: (8,0). Then at turn8: we go up to (9,1). Then same as above: then we go up each turn until (17,9). This is the same length? \n\nBut we started at turn6, and we end at turn17: that's 11 turns? \n\nWait, the number of actions: from turn6 to turn17: we have 11 actions? But we start at turn6 and we take actions at turn6,7,...,16 (that's 11 actions) and then at turn17 we are at y=9.\n\nBut note: the minimal? We could have gone up continuously from turn6 if there were no obstacles? that would take 9 moves: at turn15 we would be at y=9? \n\nBut we have obstacles at turn8: freeways 1,2,3,4,5 are dangerous. So we cannot be on freeway1 at turn8, freeway2 at turn8, etc.\n\nBut we were forced to be at y=0 at turn8? then we start going up at turn8.\n\nIs there a way to avoid the down move and still be safe?\n\nAt turn6: we are at y=0. We go up to (7,1). Then at turn7: we are at y=1 (safe). Then we cannot go up to y=2 at turn8 because freeway2 is dangerous at turn8. We cannot stay at y=1 at turn8 because freeway1 is dangerous at turn8. So the only option is to go down to y=0 at turn8.\n\nAlternatively, at turn7: we are at y=1. What if we go down at turn7 to y=0? Then at turn8: we are at y=0 (safe). Then we can go up at turn8 to y=1 at turn9? But then we are at y=1 at turn9: which is safe (freeway1 at turn9: [-60,-25] -> safe). Then we can go up.\n\nBut we cannot avoid the down move at turn7? \n\nBut wait: at turn6: we could have stayed at y=0 for two turns? Then at turn7: we are at y=0. Then at turn8: we are still at y=0. Then at turn8: we go up to y=1 at turn9. Then same as above.\n\nIn that case, we don't do a down move, but we do two stays at y=0. Then we start going up at turn8.\n\nThat sequence:\n\nTurn6: S -> then at turn7: y=0.\nTurn7: S -> then at turn8: y=0.\nTurn8: U -> then at turn9: y=1.\nTurn9: U -> y=2 (at turn10)\nTurn10: U -> y=3 (turn11)\nTurn11: U -> y=4 (turn12)\nTurn12: U -> y=5 (turn13)\nTurn13: U -> y=6 (turn14)\nTurn14: U -> y=7 (turn15)\nTurn15: U -> y=8 (turn16)\nTurn16: U -> y=9 (turn17)\n\nSame as before: 11 actions.\n\nBut can we be faster? We note that freeways 6,7,8 are safe after turn7? \n\nBut we have to pass through freeways 1 to 5, which are dangerous at turn8. So we must not be on freeways 1-5 at turn8.\n\nWe can be on freeways 0,6,7,8 at turn8? but we are at y=0 at turn8. Then we start going up.\n\nBut we cannot jump: we can only move one per turn.\n\nSo we have to avoid freeways 1-5 at turn8. How? We could be at freeway6 at turn8? but to get to freeway6 at turn8 from y=0 at turn6, we would have to go up 6 steps in 2 turns? impossible (max 2 steps in 2 turns: to y=2). So we cannot be at freeway6 at turn8.\n\nSimilarly, freeway7,8: even higher.\n\nSo the only safe freeways at turn8 are y=0 and y=6,7,8? but we cannot reach y=6,7,8 at turn8 from y=0 in 2 moves. So the only safe place at turn8 is y=0.\n\nTherefore, we must be at y=0 at turn8.\n\nThen we start going up at turn8: to y=1 at turn9.\n\nThen we go up every turn until we reach 9.\n\nBut note: at turn9: we are at y=1 -> safe (freeway1 at turn9 is safe).\nturn10: y=2 -> freeway2 at turn10: safe (as computed: [-96,-61] -> safe).\nturn11: y=3 -> freeway3 at turn11: safe (as above: [97,108], [61,72], [25,36] -> no 0).\nturn12: y=4 -> freeway4 at turn12: same as freeway3 at turn12? we computed for freeway3 at turn12: [109,120], [73,84], [37,48] -> safe.\nturn13: y=5 -> freeway5 at turn13: same -> safe.\nturn14: y=6 -> freeway6 at turn14: [85,96] -> safe.\nturn15: y=7 -> freeway7 at turn15: same as freeway6? [37+6*(15-6)=37+54=91,48+54=102] -> safe.\nturn16: y=8 -> freeway8 at turn16: \n  first car: [37+6*10=97,48+60=108] -> safe.\n  second car: [-11+60,0+60]=[49,60] -> safe.\nturn17: y=9 -> goal.\n\nSo total turns: from turn6 to turn17: 11 actions? But the goal is to reach at turn t1+H-1 = 6+H-1 = 17? so H=12? \n\nWait: the number of actions is the number of turns we take actions? \n\nWe are at turn6: we take an action at turn6, then at turn7, ... until turn16 (the last action) and then at turn17 we are at y=9. So we take actions at turns: 6,7,8,...,16 (11 actions) and the last action at turn16 leads to turn17 at y=9. So H=11? \n\nBut the problem says: sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} meaning t from 0 to H-1, so the actions are a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}. Then the position at turn t1+H is (0,9). \n\nBut note: the update: after action at turn t, the position at turn t+1 is updated.\n\nSo if we take H actions, then we end at turn t1+H.\n\nWe start at turn t1=6. After H actions, we are at turn 6+H. We want to be at (0,9) at turn 6+H.\n\nIn our case: we want to be at (0,9) at turn17. So 6+H=17 -> H=11.\n\nThe actions: from turn6 to turn16: 11 actions.\n\nWe have two possible sequences:\n\nOption 1 (with a down move):\nTurn6: U\nTurn7: D\nTurn8: U\nTurn9: U\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: U\nTurn12: U\nTurn13: U\nTurn14: U\nTurn15: U\nTurn16: U\n\nOption 2 (without down move, but two stays):\nTurn6: S\nTurn7: S\nTurn8: U\nTurn9: U\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: U\nTurn12: U\nTurn13: U\nTurn14: U\nTurn15: U\nTurn16: U\n\nBoth have 11 actions.\n\nBut the problem asks for minimal H. Both have H=11.\n\nBut is there a way with H<11?\n\nWe must be at y=0 at turn8. Then we go up 9 steps? that takes 9 moves? so from turn8 to turn17: that's 9 moves? and then we are at turn17. But we have to get from turn6 to turn8: that's 2 moves. Then total moves: 2 (for the first two turns) and then 9 (for the up moves) -> total 11 moves.\n\nBut what if we go up faster? We cannot: because we can only go one step per turn.\n\nAlternatively, we might avoid being at freeways 1-5 at turn8 by being at a freeway above 5 at turn8? but we cannot because we start at 0 and in two moves we can only get to y=2.\n\nSo minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, both sequences are valid. But the problem does not specify which one to choose. We can choose any minimal sequence.\n\nBut let me check the second car on freeway8: at turn6 and turn7: dangerous. But in the first sequence:\n\n- At turn6: we are at y=0 -> safe.\n- Then we go up: at turn7: we are at y=1 -> safe (freeway1 at turn7 safe) and freeway8 at turn7 is dangerous? but we are not on freeway8 at turn7, so safe.\n- Then at turn7: we go down: to y=0 at turn8 -> safe.\n\nIn the second sequence:\n- At turn6: we are at y=0 -> safe.\n- At turn7: we are at y=0 -> safe.\n- Then at turn8: we go up to y=1 at turn9.\n\nBoth are safe.\n\nWe can choose either.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". Both have H=11. So we can output either.\n\nI'll choose the one without the down move: two stays at the beginning.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn6: S\nTurn7: S\nTurn8: U\nTurn9: U\nTurn10: U\nTurn11: U\nTurn12: U\nTurn13: U\nTurn14: U\nTurn15: U\nTurn16: U\n\nBut wait: at turn8: we are at y=0 and we do U -> then at turn9: we are at y=1.\n\nBut we must write the actions for turns: t1=6 to t1+10=16.\n\nNow, let me verify the freeways we step on:\n\nTurn6: at (6,0): safe (y=0).\nAction: S -> then at turn7: (7,0): safe.\nAction: S -> then at turn8: (8,0): safe.\nAction: U -> then at turn9: (9,1): freeway1 at turn9: as computed: [48-36*3,83-36*3]=[48-108,83-108]=[-60,-25] -> safe.\nAction: U -> turn10: (10,2): freeway2 at turn10: same: [-96,-61] -> safe.\nAction: U -> turn11: (11,3): freeway3 at turn11: \n  car1: [37+12*5=97,48+60=108] -> safe.\n  car2: [1+60,12+60]=[61,72] -> safe.\n  car3: [-35+60,-24+60]=[25,36] -> safe.\nAction: U -> turn12: (12,4): freeway4 at turn12: \n  same as freeway3 at turn12: [37+12*6=109,48+72=120], [1+72,12+72]=[73,84], [-35+72,-24+72]=[37,48] -> safe.\nAction: U -> turn13: (13,5): freeway5: same as above at turn13: [37+84=121,48+84=132], [1+84=85,12+84=96], [-35+84=49,-24+84=60] -> safe.\nAction: U -> turn14: (14,6): freeway6: [37+6*8=85,48+48=96] -> safe? 0 not in [85,96] -> safe.\nAction: U -> turn15: (15,7): freeway7: same as freeway6? [37+6*9=37+54=91,48+54=102] -> safe.\nAction: U -> turn16: (16,8): freeway8: \n  first car: [37+6*10=97,48+60=108] -> safe.\n  second car: [-11+60,0+60]=[49,60] -> safe.\nThen at turn17: we are at (17,9): goal.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: S\nTurn 7: S\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"current turn is t1\", and t1=6. And the sequence is from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nH=11, so we write 11 actions.\n\nAlternatively, we could do the first sequence:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: U\nTurn 7: D\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\n}\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal H\", and both have the same H. So either is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps the one without the down move is simpler.\n\nI think both are valid. I'll go with the first one I wrote (the two S's at the beginning).\n\nBut note: in the two S's sequence, we never go above y=0 until turn9. And we avoid the dangerous turn8 by being at y=0.\n\nIn the other sequence, we go up to y=1 at turn7 and then back to y=0 at turn8. That also avoids the danger.\n\nBut the problem doesn't prefer one over the other.\n\nWe can output either.\n\nBut to be safe, let me check the down move: at turn7: we are at y=1 (safe). Then we go down to y=0 at turn8. Then at turn8: we are at y=0 (safe). Then we go up to y=1 at turn9 (safe). Then continue.\n\nSo both are valid.\n\nI'll choose the one without the down move to avoid unnecessary movement.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: S\nTurn 7: S\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\n}\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 6\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) by staying at \\(y = 0\\) during turns 6 and 7 (when freeways 1-8 have dangerous conditions at turn 8), then moving up continuously from turn 8 onwards.\n\nThe car states at critical turns:\n- **Turn 8**: Freeways 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are dangerous due to cars covering \\(x = 0\\). Freeway 8 is dangerous at turns 6 and 7, but safe by turn 8. Being at \\(y = 0\\) (safe) at turn 8 avoids all collisions.\n- **Turns 9-16**: All freeways from 1 to 8 are safe when traversed, as the cars do not cover \\(x = 0\\) at the respective turns.\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n\n- **Turn 6 (current turn)**: Stay (\\(S\\)) to remain at \\(y = 0\\) (safe).\n- **Turn 7**: Stay (\\(S\\)) to remain at \\(y = 0\\) (safe).\n- **Turn 8**: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1 at turn 9 is safe: car span \\([-60, -25]\\) excludes 0).\n- **Turn 9**: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2 at turn 10 is safe: car span \\([-96, -61]\\) excludes 0).\n- **Turn 10**: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3 at turn 11 is safe: car spans \\([97, 108]\\), \\([61, 72]\\), \\([25, 36]\\) exclude 0).\n- **Turn 11**: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4 at turn 12 is safe: car spans \\([109, 120]\\), \\([73, 84]\\), \\([37, 48]\\) exclude 0).\n- **Turn 12**: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5 at turn 13 is safe: car spans \\([121, 132]\\), \\([85, 96]\\), \\([49, 60]\\) exclude 0).\n- **Turn 13**: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6 at turn 14 is safe: car span \\([85, 96]\\) excludes 0).\n- **Turn 14**: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7 at turn 15 is safe: car span \\([91, 102]\\) excludes 0).\n- **Turn 15**: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8 at turn 16 is safe: car spans \\([97, 108]\\) and \\([49, 60]\\) exclude 0).\n- **Turn 16**: Move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 9\\) (goal, safe as no cars on \\(y = 9\\)).\n\nThis sequence reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn \\(6 + 11 = 17\\) with no collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 6: S\nTurn 7: S\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 7, and the player is at (0,0). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns, avoiding collisions on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nPlayer moves: U (up: y+1), D (down: y-1), S (stay: y same). Note that y is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision condition: at turn T, if the player is on a freeway k (i.e., y_T = k, and k in {1,...,8}) and at that same turn T, there is a car on freeway k such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nImportant note: when moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, at the moment of turn T, the player is still on y_T. So when we are at turn T, we are on freeway y_T, and we check for collisions on that freeway at turn T.\n\nCar movement:\n- Left-moving: at turn t1, the car's span is [h, τ] (note: h and τ are given, and for left-moving, the head is at the right and tail at the left? Actually, the update rule says: \n  Left: Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n  Right: Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note the initial state for left-moving is (head, tail) = (12,47) for freeways 1 and 2. That seems odd because 12 < 47? Then [12,47] is a segment from 12 to 47. But for left-moving, the car is moving left, so the entire segment moves left. Similarly, for right-moving, the segment moves right.\n\nBut note: for right-moving, the initial span is given as (head, tail) but the update uses [τ, h]? Actually, the update rule for right-moving is: \n  Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo the initial span at t1 for a right-moving car is [τ, h]? But in the table, for freeway 3, we have (60,49,...) for a right-moving car. But 60>49, so if the span is [49,60] then that would be a car from 49 to 60. However, the table says \"head\" and \"tail\". Let's interpret:\n\nThe problem says for a right-moving car: \n  initial: Span(t1) = [τ, h] \n  then at T: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: in the table for freeway 3, we have (head=60, tail=49, right, 12). So if the initial span is [tail, head] = [49,60]? Then the car is from 49 to 60. Then at a future time T, the span becomes [49+12*(T-7), 60+12*(T-7)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: \n  initial: [h, τ] -> [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\nFor freeway 1: head=12, tail=47 -> so initial span [12,47]. Then at T, [12-36*(T-7), 47-36*(T-7)].\n\nWe are at turn t1=7. We are going to simulate the cars from turn 7 onward.\n\nThe goal: get to y=9 as quickly as possible without colliding. We start at y=0 at turn 7. We cannot collide on y=0 because there are no freeway cars? Only freeways 1-8 have cars. So we are safe at y=0.\n\nBut note: we must avoid being on a freeway k (1<=k<=8) at a turn T when 0 is in the span of a car on that freeway at T.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway and for each car on that freeway, the positions at future turns.\n\nWe are going to plan a sequence of actions. We can only move up, down, or stay. We start at y0=0 at turn 7. We need to end at y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns? At minimum, we need at least 9 moves up (from 0 to 9). But we can also move down or stay, so H might be more than 9.\n\nWe are to minimize H (the number of turns, including the starting turn? Note: the sequence is for turns t1, t1+1, ... up to t1+H-1. And we require that at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). So the actions are taken from turn t1 to turn t1+H-2? Actually, the sequence has H actions: from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1? Let me see the problem:\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t=0 to H-1, so H actions. And we start at turn t1 (which is 7) and do action a_{t1} (which is the first action at turn t1). Then at turn t1+1, we do a_{t1+1}, etc. until turn t1+H-1. Then the state after the last action is at turn t1+H-1. We require that at that turn, we are at (0,9).\n\nSo we start at (0,0) at the beginning of turn t1=7. Then we choose an action for turn 7, then we update the position and the cars move. Then at the next turn, we choose again, etc.\n\nWe need to avoid being at a freeway k at a turn T (for T>=7) when 0 is in the span of a car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nWe'll compute the car positions at integer turns starting from 7.\n\nLet me write down the car spans for each freeway and each car at a given turn T (relative to t0=7, so T=7,8,9,...).\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head=12, tail=47, left, speed=36)\n  This is left-moving. Initial span at T=7: [12,47]\n  At turn T: [12 - 36*(T-7), 47 - 36*(T-7)]\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway1: [12,47] at T=7, then [12-36*(T-7), 47-36*(T-7)]\n\nFreeway 3: three cars:\n  Car1: (60,49, right, 12) -> initial: [49,60] (because for right: [tail, head] = [49,60])\n      At T: [49+12*(T-7), 60+12*(T-7)]\n  Car2: (24,13, right,12) -> initial: [13,24] -> at T: [13+12*(T-7), 24+12*(T-7)]\n  Car3: (-12,-23, right,12) -> initial: [-23,-12] -> at T: [-23+12*(T-7), -12+12*(T-7)]\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway3: three cars with the same parameters.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway3 and 4.\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (54,43, right,6) -> initial: [43,54] -> at T: [43+6*(T-7), 54+6*(T-7)]\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway6: [43,54] -> [43+6*(T-7), 54+6*(T-7)]\n\nFreeway 8: two cars:\n  Car1: (54,43, right,6) -> same as above: [43,54] -> [43+6*(T-7), 54+6*(T-7)]\n  Car2: (6,-5, right,6) -> initial: [-5,6] -> at T: [-5+6*(T-7), 6+6*(T-7)]\n\nWe are at turn T (starting at 7). We are at position y_T. We are safe at y=0 and y=9 (since no cars on those rows). But note: we are required to end at (0,9). At y=9, we are safe because there are no freeway cars.\n\nWe need to go from y=0 (at turn7) to y=9 in minimal H.\n\nWe can model this as a state-space search: state = (turn, y). But note that the turn number matters because the car positions change with time.\n\nWe are only concerned with the times when we are on the freeways. We can compute for each freeway and each time T, whether the freeway is safe (i.e., 0 is not in any car's span at that time).\n\nWe'll compute for a range of turns. Since the cars move at constant speed and we are only concerned with when 0 is in the span, we can compute the times when a car is covering 0.\n\nBut note: the minimal H must be at least 9 (if we go up 9 times). But we might have to wait sometimes? Or even go down? However, going down from 0 is not possible because y cannot go below 0. So we can only go up or stay.\n\nWe start at y=0 at turn7. We can only go up to y=1 or stay at y=0. But if we go up to y=1 at turn7, then at turn7 we are at y=0 (because we start at y=0 at the beginning of turn7, and then we move at the end of the turn? Actually, the update: after the action at turn t, we get y_{t+1}. \n\nWait, the problem says: at turn T, we are at position (0, y_T). Then we choose an action a_T, and then we update to y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T. \n\nSo at the beginning of turn T, we are at y_T. Then we choose a_T, and then we move to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nBut the collision condition: at turn T, we are on freeway y_T. And we check if at turn T, there is a car on freeway y_T such that 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nSo when we are at the beginning of turn T at y_T, we are on row y_T and we check the cars at turn T on row y_T.\n\nThen we take an action, and then we are at y_{T+1} at the beginning of turn T+1.\n\nTherefore, we are safe at turn T=7: y7=0 -> no freeway car at row0, so safe.\n\nWe then choose an action for turn7: U, D, or S. But note: we are at y=0. If we choose D, then y8 = 0-1 = -1 -> but it's bounded to 0. So y8=0. Similarly, if we choose S, y8=0. If we choose U, y8=1.\n\nWe need to avoid being at a freeway row at a turn when 0 is covered by a car.\n\nLet's compute for each freeway and for each future turn T (>=7) whether 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nWe'll do this for T from 7 to, say, 20 (since we don't expect H to be too large, at least 9 and at most? we can wait so it might be more).\n\nFreeway 1 (left-moving, one car: [12-36*(T-7), 47-36*(T-7)]):\n  0 in [12-36*(T-7), 47-36*(T-7)]?\n  => 12-36*(T-7) <= 0 <= 47-36*(T-7)\n\n  Solve:\n    12 - 36*(T-7) <= 0  => 36*(T-7) >= 12 => T-7 >= 12/36 = 1/3 => T>=7.33 -> so T>=8\n    and 0 <= 47-36*(T-7) => 36*(T-7) <=47 => T-7 <=47/36≈1.305 => T<=8.305 -> so T<=8\n\n  Therefore, only at T=8: \n    Check: T=8: [12-36*1, 47-36*1] = [-24, 11] -> 0 is in [-24,11]? Yes.\n\n  So freeway1 is unsafe at T=8.\n\n  For T=7: [12,47] -> 0 not in [12,47] -> safe.\n  T=9: [12-36*2,47-36*2] = [-60,-25] -> 0 not in this interval.\n\n  So freeway1: unsafe at T=8, safe otherwise.\n\nFreeway2: same as freeway1 -> unsafe at T=8, safe otherwise.\n\nFreeway3: three cars.\n\n  Car1: [49+12*(T-7), 60+12*(T-7)]\n    0 in [49+12*(T-7), 60+12*(T-7)]?\n    => 49+12*(T-7) <=0<=60+12*(T-7) -> \n      left: 49+12*(T-7) <=0 -> 12*(T-7)<=-49 -> impossible because T>=7 -> so never.\n\n  Car2: [13+12*(T-7), 24+12*(T-7)]\n    Similarly, 13+12*(T-7) >=13>0 for T>=7 -> so 0 is never in this interval.\n\n  Car3: [-23+12*(T-7), -12+12*(T-7)]\n    0 in this interval?\n    => -23+12*(T-7) <=0<=-12+12*(T-7)\n    Left: -23+12*(T-7)<=0 -> 12*(T-7)<=23 -> T-7<=23/12≈1.916 -> T<=8.916 -> T<=8 (since integer)\n    Right: 0<=-12+12*(T-7) -> 12*(T-7)>=12 -> T-7>=1 -> T>=8.\n\n    So at T=8: \n        span: [-23+12*1, -12+12*1] = [-11,0] -> 0 is in [-11,0]? Yes, at the upper bound.\n\n    Therefore, freeway3 is unsafe at T=8.\n\n    T=7: [-23,-12] -> 0 not in.\n    T=9: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12] -> 0 not in.\n\n  So freeway3: unsafe at T=8.\n\nFreeway4: same as freeway3 -> unsafe at T=8.\n\nFreeway5: same -> unsafe at T=8.\n\nFreeway6: one car: [43+6*(T-7), 54+6*(T-7)]\n  0 in [43+6*(T-7), 54+6*(T-7)]?\n  -> 43+6*(T-7) <=0<=54+6*(T-7)\n  left: 43+6*(T-7)<=0 -> 6*(T-7)<=-43 -> impossible -> safe for all T.\n\nFreeway7: same as freeway6 -> safe for all T.\n\nFreeway8: two cars.\n  Car1: same as freeway6: [43+6*(T-7), 54+6*(T-7)] -> safe for all T.\n  Car2: [-5+6*(T-7), 6+6*(T-7)]\n    0 in [-5+6*(T-7), 6+6*(T-7)]?\n    => -5+6*(T-7) <=0<=6+6*(T-7)\n    left: -5+6*(T-7)<=0 -> 6*(T-7)<=5 -> T-7<=5/6≈0.833 -> T<=7.833 -> T=7\n    right: 0<=6+6*(T-7) -> always true for T>=7.\n\n    At T=7: span = [-5,6] -> 0 is in [-5,6]? Yes.\n\n    So freeway8 is unsafe at T=7.\n\n    But note: at T=7, we are at the beginning of the turn. We are at y_7=0. We are not on freeway8 (which is row8). So if we were to be on freeway8 at turn7, we would collide. But we are at y=0, so safe.\n\n    However, if we are on freeway8 at turn T=7, we would collide. But we are at y=0 at turn7.\n\n    Now, for T=8: \n        span: [-5+6*1, 6+6*1] = [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n    T=9: [7,18] -> safe.\n\n    So freeway8: unsafe at T=7? But we are not there at T=7. So for our path, we only care when we are on that row at that turn.\n\n    Actually, freeway8 is unsafe only at T=7? But at T=7, the car is present at 0? Yes. But if we are at row8 at turn7, we collide. But we start at row0 at turn7, so we are safe.\n\n    Then for T>=8, freeway8 is safe.\n\nSummary of unsafe turns for each freeway:\n\nFreeway1: T=8\nFreeway2: T=8\nFreeway3: T=8\nFreeway4: T=8\nFreeway5: T=8\nFreeway6: safe for all T (from 7 to ...)\nFreeway7: safe for all T\nFreeway8: T=7\n\nNote: freeway8 is unsafe at T=7, but we are not on row8 at turn7.\n\nNow, the key point: we must avoid being on a freeway row at the turn when that freeway is unsafe.\n\nSpecifically:\n- Row1: avoid at T=8\n- Row2: avoid at T=8\n- Row3: avoid at T=8\n- Row4: avoid at T=8\n- Row5: avoid at T=8\n- Row8: avoid at T=7 (but we are at turn7 and at row0, so we won't be on row8 at turn7)\n\nBut note: we are at turn7 at row0. We want to move up.\n\nWe are going to simulate the next turns.\n\nWe are at turn7: y7=0 (safe). We choose an action.\n\nWe have three choices: \n  U: then y8 = 1\n  D: then y8 = 0 (clamped to 0)\n  S: then y8 = 0\n\nIf we choose U, then at turn8 we will be at row1. But row1 is unsafe at turn8 -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot choose U at turn7.\n\nIf we choose D or S, we stay at row0 at turn8.\n\nAt turn8: we are at row0 (safe). Then we choose an action.\n\nAt turn8: what are the unsafe freeways?\n\nFrom above, at turn8:\n  Row1: unsafe (T=8)\n  Row2: unsafe\n  Row3: unsafe\n  Row4: unsafe\n  Row5: unsafe\n  Row6: safe\n  Row7: safe\n  Row8: safe (since unsafe only at T=7)\n\nSo at turn8, we are at row0. We can choose:\n\n  U: then y9 = 1 -> but then at turn9, we are at row1. Now, we need to check row1 at turn9: \n      For row1: we saw that only at turn8 it is unsafe. At turn9: \n          [12-36*(9-7), 47-36*(9-7)] = [12-72, 47-72] = [-60,-25] -> safe.\n      So row1 is safe at turn9.\n\n  D: then y9=0\n  S: then y9=0\n\nSo if we choose U at turn8, then at turn9 we are at row1 (safe). Then we can continue.\n\nBut note: we must also avoid other unsafe times. We have to check the entire path.\n\nAlternatively, we can plan:\n\nWe want to get to row9 as quickly as possible. The minimal number of moves is 9 (if we go up 9 times). But we cannot go up at turn7 because that would put us at row1 at turn8 (unsafe). So we must wait at row0 for one turn.\n\nSo at turn7: we choose S (or D, but D would also keep us at 0). Then at turn8: we are at row0. Then at turn8: we choose U, then at turn9: row1.\n\nNow, from row1 at turn9: we want to go to row2. But we must check row2 at turn9: \n  Row2: unsafe only at turn8 -> so at turn9 it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, row3,4,5: unsafe only at turn8, so safe at turn9 and beyond.\n\nRow6,7,8: always safe (except row8 at turn7, which is past).\n\nSo we can go up without stopping from row1 to row8? But we need to check: is there any other unsafe time?\n\nWe have computed for each row the unsafe turn. For rows 1-5: only unsafe at T=8. For row8: unsafe at T=7. Rows6,7: safe always.\n\nSo from turn9 onward, all rows are safe? \n\nBut wait: what about row3? We have freeway3: we saw only unsafe at T=8. But are there other times? \n\nFor freeway3, car3: we saw only T=8 is unsafe. The other cars on freeway3 were never unsafe. Similarly for the others.\n\nSo after turn8, all freeways are safe.\n\nTherefore, we can move up continuously from row0 at turn8 to row9 without stopping.\n\nBut note: we are at row0 at turn8. Then:\n\nTurn8: U -> row1 at turn9 (safe)\nTurn9: U -> row2 at turn10 (safe)\nTurn10: U -> row3 at turn11 (safe)\nTurn11: U -> row4 at turn12 (safe)\nTurn12: U -> row5 at turn13 (safe)\nTurn13: U -> row6 at turn14 (safe)\nTurn14: U -> row7 at turn15 (safe)\nTurn15: U -> row8 at turn16 (safe, because row8 is unsafe only at turn7, and now turn16)\nTurn16: U -> row9 at turn17.\n\nSo we reach row9 at turn17.\n\nBut we started at turn7 at row0. We took:\n\nTurn7: S (or D) -> then at turn8 we are at row0.\nThen from turn8 to turn16: 8 moves up? Actually, from row0 to row9: we need 9 moves. But we start at row0 at turn8, and then:\n\nAfter 1st U (turn8): row1 at turn9\n2nd U (turn9): row2 at turn10\n3rd U (turn10): row3 at turn11\n4th U (turn11): row4 at turn12\n5th U (turn12): row5 at turn13\n6th U (turn13): row6 at turn14\n7th U (turn14): row7 at turn15\n8th U (turn15): row8 at turn16\n9th U (turn16): row9 at turn17.\n\nSo we need 9 moves after turn7? But we have:\n\nAt turn7: we did S (so we are at row0 at turn8).\nThen we do 9 moves: turns 8,9,...,16: 9 actions.\n\nTotal turns: from turn7 to turn17? The sequence of actions: \n  turn7: S\n  turn8: U\n  turn9: U\n  ...\n  turn16: U\n\nThen at turn17: we are at row9. So H = number of actions? We have 10 actions: from turn7 to turn16. Then we are at row9 at turn17.\n\nBut the problem: we are to write the actions for turns t1 (7) to t1+H-1. And H is the minimal number of turns (i.e., the number of actions). We require that at the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we are at (0,9).\n\nSo at turn t1+H-1 = 7+H-1, we are at row9.\n\nIn our plan:\n  At turn7: action S -> then at turn8: row0 -> not 9.\n  ...\n  At turn16: action U -> then at turn17: row9.\n\nSo the last action is at turn16, and then at turn17 we are at row9. Therefore, the last action is at turn16 = 7 + 9? Because 7 to 16 is 10 turns? \n\nLet me count the turns we take actions: \n  turn7, turn8, turn9, turn10, turn11, turn12, turn13, turn14, turn15, turn16 -> 10 actions.\n\nThen H=10.\n\nWe end at turn17 (which is after the last action) at row9.\n\nBut the problem says: we require that at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\nt1+H-1 = 7+10-1 = 16? Then we require at turn16 we are at (0,9). But in our plan, at turn16 we are at row8 (because we do U at turn16 to get to row9 at turn17). So that does not satisfy.\n\nWe must be at row9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? \n\nLet me read: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1+H-1. \n\nThe problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nSo we require that at the state at turn (t1+H-1), we are at y=9.\n\nThe state at turn (t1+H-1) is the result after the last action? \n\nWe start at turn t1: state (y_{t1}) = (0,0) at turn t1.\nThen we take action a_{t1} -> we get y_{t1+1} at the next turn (turn t1+1).\n...\nWe take the last action at turn (t1+H-1) -> we get y_{t1+H} at turn t1+H? \n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1: \n  a_{t1+0}, a_{t1+1}, ..., a_{t1+H-1}\n\nThen after these H actions, the next state is at turn t1+H. But we require that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me parse: \n  At turn t1, we are at (0, y_{t1}) = (0,0).\n  We take action a_{t1} -> then we are at state (0, y_{t1+1}) at turn t1+1.\n  ... \n  At turn t1+H-1, we are at (0, y_{t1+H-1}) and we take action a_{t1+H-1}? \n  Then after that action, we are at state (0, y_{t1+H}) at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the requirement is: at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\nSo we require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). But then we would take an action? and then move? But we don't need to take an action if we are already at 9? \n\nHowever, the sequence has H actions. So if we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, then we have taken H-1 actions to get there, and then we would take an action at turn t1+H-1? But we don't want to move away? \n\nWe can choose S at the last action to stay at 9. \n\nBut the requirement is: we must be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. Then we take an action at that turn? \n\nYes, the sequence includes H actions, the last one at turn t1+H-1. Then after that action, we are at the next state at turn t1+H. \n\nBut the problem says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nThis implies that the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 is 9? Then we take an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nWait, the state y_t is defined at the beginning of turn t. Then we take action a_t and then we get y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nSo the requirement is: at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nBut then we have to take an action at turn t1+H-1? But we are already at 9. We can choose S to stay at 9. Then at turn t1+H, we are still at 9.\n\nBut the requirement is only that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. So the action at turn t1+H-1 can be anything? But we don't care about beyond that turn? \n\nHowever, we must not collide at turn t1+H-1. Since we are at row9, which is safe, then we are safe.\n\nBut in our plan, we are at row9 at turn17. So we require that at turn17 we are at row9. Then we must have:\n\ny_{17} = 9.\n\nThe turn index: \n  At turn7: y7=0.\n  Then we take actions at turns 7,8,...,16 (if we take 10 actions) and then at turn17 we are at y17.\n\nSo to have y_{17}=9, that is the state at the beginning of turn17. \n\nTherefore, we set t1+H-1 = 17? \n  t1 = 7, so 7 + H - 1 = 17 -> H-1 = 10 -> H=11.\n\nBut that doesn't match because we have 10 actions.\n\nAlternatively, note: the state at turn t is the state before action at turn t. \n\nWe have:\n  Turn7: state y7=0 -> take action a7 -> then state at turn8: y8 = y7 + Δy7.\n  Turn8: state y8 -> take a8 -> then y9 = y8 + Δy8.\n  ...\n  Turn16: state y16 -> take a16 -> then y17 = y16 + Δy16.\n\nWe require that at the beginning of turn17, y17=9? But the problem says: at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9.\n\nSo we require that at the beginning of turn (7+H-1) we are at 9.\n\nSo 7+H-1 = 17? -> H-1=10 -> H=11.\n\nBut then we have 11 actions? from turn7 to turn17? \n\nBut we are at turn17 at the beginning: we haven't taken an action at turn17? The sequence is from turn7 to turn7+H-1 = 7+11-1=17? Then we take an action at turn17? and then we get state at turn18? \n\nBut we don't care about turn18? We only require that at the beginning of turn17 we are at 9? \n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nI think I see the confusion. The problem says:\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nwhich means t=0,1,...,H-1. So the actions are for turns: t1+0, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAnd then we require that at the turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\nBut note: the state at the beginning of turn t is y_t. Then we take action a_t, which updates to y_{t+1}.\n\nSo after we take the last action (at turn t1+H-1), we update to y_{t1+H}. \n\nBut the requirement is about the state at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? \n\nNo, the requirement is: at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nBut \"at turn t1+H-1\" refers to the state at the beginning of that turn? \n\nI think that is the case. Because the turn index is associated with the state at the beginning.\n\nSo we require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). Then we take an action at that turn? \n\nYes, and that action is the last one in the sequence. \n\nSo the sequence has H actions: from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1. \n\nAnd we require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nThen we take the last action at turn t1+H-1, and then we update to y_{t1+H}. But we don't care what happens after that.\n\nBut we must not collide at turn t1+H-1: because we are on a freeway row at that turn? And we are at row9, which is safe.\n\nSo in our plan, we want to be at row9 at the beginning of turn17? \n\nHow do we get there?\n\nWe want y17=9? \n\nBut from our earlier plan, we are at row9 at the beginning of turn17 if we took an action at turn16 that moved us from row8 to row9.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn16, we are at row8. Then we take U at turn16, and then at turn17 we are at row9.\n\nBut we require that at the beginning of turn17 we are at row9. So that is the state at turn17.\n\nTherefore, we require that the state at turn17 is 9. \n\nAnd the last action we take is at turn16? Then the sequence of actions is from turn7 to turn16? That is 10 actions: turns 7,8,...,16.\n\nThen H=10? And t1+H-1 = 7+10-1=16. But at the beginning of turn16, we are at row8 (not 9). \n\nBut we require at the beginning of turn16 (which is turn t1+H-1) to be at 9. \n\nSo we must be at row9 at the beginning of turn16.\n\nHow can we achieve that?\n\nWe need to get to row9 by the beginning of turn16.\n\nWe start at turn7: row0.\n\nWe have 9 moves: from turn7 to turn15 (if we take 9 actions) then we would be at row9 at turn16? \n\nHow?\n\nAt turn7: we start at row0. We take action a7 -> then at turn8: y8 = y7 + Δy7.\n...\nAt turn15: we take action a15 -> then at turn16: y16 = y15 + Δy15.\n\nWe require y16=9.\n\nWe have 9 actions: from turn7 to turn15 (9 actions: t=0 to 8, so H=9).\n\nThen t1+H-1 = 7+9-1=15. We require at the beginning of turn15 to be at 9? No, we require at turn15 (the last turn we take an action) we are at 9? \n\nThe requirement: at turn t1+H-1 =15, we are at 9. That means at the beginning of turn15, we are at row9.\n\nBut we take an action at turn15? Then we move to y16. But we don't care about y16.\n\nSo we can be at row9 at turn15, and then we take S (to stay) at turn15, and then at turn16 we are still at row9.\n\nBut we are required to be at row9 at the beginning of turn15.\n\nSo we must arrive at row9 by the beginning of turn15.\n\nThat requires 9 moves up. We start at row0 at turn7.\n\nWe need to be at row9 at turn15.\n\nThe number of turns between turn7 and turn15: 8 turns? We have 8 actions: from turn7 to turn14? \n\nLet me clarify:\n\nTo be at row9 at the beginning of turn15, we must have taken actions at turns 7 to 14 (8 actions) that moved us from row0 to row9. But that requires 9 moves? \n\nWe start at turn7: row0.\nAfter 1st U (at turn7): at turn8, row1.\n2nd U (turn8): turn9, row2.\n...\n9th U (turn15-1 = turn14): at turn15, row9.\n\nSo we need 9 actions? from turn7 to turn15-1? But then the last action is at turn14? Then the sequence is from turn7 to turn14: 8 actions? \n\nThis is messy.\n\nWe need to be at row9 at the beginning of turn T. How many actions are needed? \n\nEach action can move us up by at most 1. From row0 to row9: 9 moves up.\n\nWe start at turn7: row0.\n\nAfter 9 moves up, we will be at row9 at turn7+9 = turn16.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn16, we are at row9.\n\nTherefore, we want to be at row9 at turn16.\n\nThen the last action we take is at turn15: we do U (if we were at row8) or S (if we are already at row9) at turn15 to ensure we are at row9 at turn16? But if we are at row9 at turn15, then we can do S at turn15 to stay at row9 at turn16.\n\nBut to be at row9 at turn15, we would have arrived at turn15? That would require 8 moves? because from turn7 to turn15 is 8 turns? \n\nLet's simulate:\n\nTurn7: y7=0 -> take U -> y8=1\nTurn8: y8=1 -> take U -> y9=2\n...\nTurn14: y14=7 -> take U -> y15=8\nTurn15: y15=8 -> take U -> y16=9.\n\nSo to get to y16=9, we took actions at turns7 to 15: 9 actions.\n\nThen the beginning of turn16: we are at row9.\n\nBut we require that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. \n\nHere, t1=7, and we have taken H actions? The actions are at turns 7,8,...,15: that's 9 actions -> H=9.\n\nThen t1+H-1 = 7+9-1 = 15.\n\nBut at the beginning of turn15, we are at row8 (not 9). \n\nThe requirement is that at turn15 (the beginning) we are at row9? But we are at row8.\n\nSo we are not satisfying the requirement.\n\nThe requirement is to be at row9 at the beginning of the turn when we take the last action? \n\nThe last action is at turn t1+H-1. And we are at that turn (before taking the action) at row9.\n\nSo we must be at row9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\nThen we take an action (which could be S) and then we move to row9 (if S) at the next turn, but we don't care.\n\nSo we need to arrive at row9 at the beginning of some turn T.\n\nHow? By taking actions in the previous turns.\n\nTo be at row9 at the beginning of turn T, we must have been at row8 at the beginning of turn T-1 and taken U at turn T-1, or at row9 and taken S, etc.\n\nThe minimal T for which we can be at row9 is turn7+9 = turn16.\n\nBecause we need 9 moves.\n\nSo at the beginning of turn16, we can be at row9.\n\nThen we want to take our last action at turn15? because then the last action is at turn15, and at the beginning of turn15 we are at row8, then we take U at turn15, and then at turn16 we are at row9.\n\nBut the requirement is that at the beginning of turn15 (which is the last action turn) we are at row9? No, we are at row8.\n\nIf we want to be at row9 at the beginning of the last action turn, then the last action turn must be at least turn16.\n\nThen the last action is at turn16: and we require that at the beginning of turn16 we are at row9. Then we take an action (S) at turn16, and then at turn17 we are at row9.\n\nSo the sequence: actions from turn7 to turn16.\n\nThen H=10 actions.\n\nThen t1+H-1 = 7+10-1 = 16. And we require that at turn16 we are at (0,9). That means at the beginning of turn16, we are at row9.\n\nBut how do we get to row9 by turn16? \n\nWe can do it by taking 9 ups in the first 9 actions, and then the last action is S at turn16? But then we were at row9 at turn16 already, so we take S to stay.\n\nBut how to be at row9 at turn16:\n\nWe start at turn7: row0.\n\nWe need to do 9 ups in the actions from turn7 to turn15. Then at turn16, we will be at row9.\n\nSo actions:\n  turn7: U -> turn8: row1\n  turn8: U -> turn9: row2\n  ...\n  turn15: U -> turn16: row9\n\nThen at turn16, we are at row9. Then we take an action at turn16? The problem requires a sequence of H actions. And we require that at turn16 (the beginning) we are at row9. Then we can take any action? but we are already at 9. \n\nSo we take S at turn16.\n\nBut then the sequence has 10 actions: turns7 to 16.\n\nBut at the beginning of turn16, we are at row9, so we are safe (row9 has no cars). Then we take S at turn16, which is the last action.\n\nSo H=10.\n\nBut can we do it without waiting? We saw that at turn7 we cannot go up because then at turn8 we would be at row1 and it's unsafe.\n\nSo we must wait at least one turn at row0.\n\nTherefore, we cannot do 9 consecutive ups from turn7 to turn15.\n\nWe must spend one turn at row0.\n\nSo how about:\n\n  turn7: S (stay at row0) -> at turn8, still row0.\n  turn8: U -> at turn9, row1.\n  turn9: U -> turn10, row2.\n  ...\n  turn15: U -> turn16, row8.\n  turn16: U -> turn17, row9.\n\nBut then at turn16, we are at row8. We are not at row9 at turn16.\n\nWe want to be at row9 at turn16? We would need to be at row8 at turn15 and then U at turn15 -> row9 at turn16.\n\nBut in the above, we are at row0 at turn8, then we do 8 ups: from turn8 to turn15 -> that's 8 actions, so we would be at row8 at turn16.\n\nThen at turn16: U -> row9 at turn17.\n\nSo we are at row9 at turn17.\n\nTo be at row9 at turn16, we must have been at row8 at turn15 and done U at turn15.\n\nBut to be at row8 at turn15, we need 8 ups. We start at turn7: row0.\n\nIf we do U at turn7, we would be at row1 at turn8 -> but unsafe at row1 at turn8.\n\nSo we cannot do U at turn7.\n\nWe do S at turn7: row0 at turn8.\nThen U at turn8: row1 at turn9 (safe).\nThen U at turn9: row2 at turn10 (safe).\n...\nU at turn14: row7 at turn15.\nU at turn15: row8 at turn16.\n\nBut we want to be at row9 at turn16, not row8.\n\nSo we need to be at row9 at turn16, which requires that at turn15 we are at row8 and then we do U at turn15 -> row9 at turn16.\n\nBut to be at row8 at turn15, we need 8 moves up. We start at turn7.\n\nWe can do:\n  turn7: S (row0 at turn8)\n  turn8: U (row1 at turn9)\n  turn9: U (row2 at turn10)\n  turn10: U (row3 at turn11)\n  turn11: U (row4 at turn12)\n  turn12: U (row5 at turn13)\n  turn13: U (row6 at turn14)\n  turn14: U (row7 at turn15)\n  turn15: U (row8 at turn16) -> not 9.\n\nWe are at row8 at turn16.\n\nWe need one more U to get to row9 at turn17.\n\nSo to be at row9 at turn16, we must have done the first U earlier.\n\nBut we cannot do it at turn7.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to be at row8 at turn14? then U at turn14: row9 at turn15.\n then at turn15: we are at row9. Then we can take S at turn15 to stay at row9 at turn16.\n\nThis requires being at row8 at turn14.\n\nHow many moves from row0 at turn7 to row8 at turn14? 8 moves.\n\nBut we have turns 7 to 13 to do 8 moves? That's 7 actions.\n\nWe start at turn7: row0.\nActions at turn7,8,...,13: 7 actions.\n\nAt turn7: if we do U, then turn8: row1 -> unsafe.\nSo we must do S at turn7: turn8: row0.\nThen we have 7 actions left (turns8 to14) to do 8 moves? Impossible.\n\nTherefore, the earliest we can be at row9 is turn17.\n\nSo we must be at row9 at turn17.\n\nThen the last action we take is at turn16: we do U (from row8 to row9) and then at turn17 we are at row9.\n\nThen the sequence has actions from turn7 to turn16: 10 actions. Then H=10.\n\nAnd we require that at turn t1+H-1 = 7+10-1 = 16, we are at (0,9)? But at turn16 (beginning) we are at row8, not 9.\n\nBut the requirement is to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1 =16.\n\nSo we are not meeting the requirement.\n\n unless we are at row9 at turn16.\n\nHow to be at row9 at turn16 with one wait? We can't.\n\nThen we must be at row9 at turn17.\n\nSo we need to set H such that t1+H-1 = 17.\n\nSo 7+H-1 = 17 -> H=11.\n\nThen we take 11 actions: from turn7 to turn17.\n\nAt turn17, we are at row9 at the beginning? Then we take an action at turn17 (S) to satisfy the sequence of 11 actions.\n\nBut we are already at row9 at turn17, so we can do S.\n\nHow to get to row9 at turn17:\n\nWe do:\n  turn7: S  -> turn8: row0\n  turn8: U  -> turn9: row1\n  turn9: U  -> turn10: row2\n  turn10: U -> turn11: row3\n  turn11: U -> turn12: row4\n  turn12: U -> turn13: row5\n  turn13: U -> turn14: row6\n  turn14: U -> turn15: row7\n  turn15: U -> turn16: row8\n  turn16: U -> turn17: row9\n  turn17: S -> turn18: row9 (but we don't care)\n\nThen at turn17 (beginning), we are at row9. Then we take action S at turn17.\n\nThe sequence has 11 actions: turns7 to 17.\n\nAnd at turn17 (the last action turn, and also the state is at row9), we are safe.\n\nSo H=11.\n\nBut is there a faster way? We wait one turn at the beginning, then move up every turn. Total turns from start to finish: from turn7 to turn17 for the state to be at row9, but we are only required to be at row9 at turn17 (which is the last action turn).\n\nThe minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let me confirm if we can do it in 10 actions with a different path.\n\nFor example, could we go down? But we are at row0, so down is not possible.\n\nOr could we go up later? But then we might arrive later.\n\nOr is there a way to be at row9 sooner than turn17? We saw that we can't because we have to wait at turn7.\n\nUnless we can avoid the unsafe row at turn8 by being on a different row at turn8.\n\nBut at turn7, we are at row0. We can only move to row1 or stay at row0.\n\nIf we move to row1 at turn7, then at turn8 we are at row1 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we must not be at row1 at turn8. Therefore, the only safe choice at turn7 is to stay at row0.\n\nThen at turn8, we are at row0. Then we can move to row1 at turn8, and then at turn9 we are at row1, which is safe.\n\nSo the path is fixed for the first two turns: S at turn7, U at turn8.\n\nThen we move up as fast as possible: one per turn.\n\nThat takes 9 ups from turn8 to turn16: but then at turn17 we are at row9.\n\nAnd we need to include the action at turn7 (S) and then the 9 ups from turn8 to turn16: total 10 actions? Then the last action is at turn16, and at turn16 (beginning) we are at row8. Then after U at turn16, at turn17 we are at row9. But the requirement is to be at row9 at turn16 ( if H=10, then turn7+10-1=16) -> not satisfied.\n\nTo be at row9 at turn16, we would have to have done the first up at turn7, but we can't.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 11, with the last action at turn17.\n\nActions:\n\n turn7: S\n turn8: U\n turn9: U\n turn10: U\n turn11: U\n turn12: U\n turn13: U\n turn14: U\n turn15: U\n turn16: U\n turn17: S\n\nThen at turn17 (beginning), we are at row9. Then we do S at turn17.\n\nBut note: at turn17, we are at row9, which is safe. Then we do S, which is safe.\n\nBut is there a way to not do the last S? \n\nThe sequence must have H=11 actions. We have to specify 11 actions.\n\nBut we are at row9 at turn17, and we do S, which is fine.\n\nAlternatively, could we do the last S at an earlier time? No, because we arrive at turn17.\n\nBut wait, after turn16: we are at row9 at turn17. So the action at turn17 is not necessary for moving, but the sequence requires 11 actions.\n\nWe could do a different action at turn17, but S is fine.\n\nNow, is there a way with H=10? We would need to be at row9 at turn16 (7+10-1=16). \n\nHow? We need 9 ups. We start at turn7: row0.\n\nIf we do 9 ups in 9 actions: turns7 to 15, then at turn16 we are at row9.\n\nActions:\n turn7: U -> unsafe at turn8: row1 -> collision.\n\nIf we do 8 ups and one wait, then we would be at row8 at turn16, not 9.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, let's write the actions:\n\nTurn 7: S\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: S\n\nBut wait, at turn17: we are already at row9 at the beginning, and we do S. But the requirement is satisfied: at turn17 (which is 7+11-1=17) we are at row9.\n\nAnd we avoid collisions:\n\n- turn7: at row0 -> safe.\n- turn8: at row0 -> safe.\n- turn9: at row1 -> safe (because row1 is unsafe only at turn8, and we are at row1 at turn9: safe).\n- similarly, turn10: row2 -> safe.\n- ...\n- turn16: at row8 -> safe (row8 unsafe only at turn7, and now turn16: safe).\n- turn17: at row9 -> safe.\n\nSo no collisions.\n\nBut do we need the action at turn17? We are at row9, and we are required to be at row9 at turn17. Then we take an action. The problem doesn't say we have to stop as soon as we reach, but we have to provide H actions. So it's fine.\n\nPerhaps we can avoid the last action by setting H=10 and being at row9 at turn16, but we saw that's impossible.\n\nSo we go with H=11.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". Is there a way with H=10? We saw not.\n\nAlternatively, could we go up faster by not waiting at the beginning? But then we collide.\n\nOr could we take a different route? For example, go down? But we are at row0, can't go down.\n\nOr move up and then down to avoid? But that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if we go up to row2 by turn9, but then at turn9 we are at row2, which is safe. But we are already safe from turn9 onward, so we can continue up. But we still have to do 9 ups, and we started with a wait, so it will take at least 10 actions to get to row9 at turn17.\n\nAnd then one more action for the last turn -> H=11.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 7: S\nTurn 8: U\nTurn 9: U\nTurn 10: U\nTurn 11: U\nTurn 12: U\nTurn 13: U\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: S\n}\n\nBut let me count the actions: from turn7 to turn17: 11 actions.\n\nAnd at turn17 (the last action turn, which is 7+11-1=17), we are at row9.\n\nYes.\n\nNote: we could do D at turn7 instead of S, but that would also keep us at row0, so it's the same. But S is more natural.\n\nSo we use S.\n\nFinal answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) is 11, starting from turn \\(t_1 = 7\\) at position \\((0, 0)\\). The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) as follows:\n\n- At turn 7, the player is at \\(y = 0\\) (safe, as no cars are on \\(y = 0\\)). Choosing \\(S\\) (stay) keeps the player at \\(y = 0\\) for turn 8.\n- At turn 8, the player is at \\(y = 0\\) (safe). Choosing \\(U\\) (up) moves to \\(y = 1\\) for turn 9. Freeway 1 is unsafe at turn 8, but the player is not on freeway 1 at turn 8 (still on \\(y = 0\\)).\n- From turns 9 to 16, the player moves up each turn. Freeways 1 to 5 are only unsafe at turn 8, so they are safe for turns 9 and beyond. Freeways 6 and 7 are always safe. Freeway 8 is unsafe only at turn 7, so it is safe for turns 9 to 16.\n- At turn 9, the player is at \\(y = 1\\) (safe), and \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 2\\) for turn 10.\n- Similarly, actions \\(U\\) at turns 10 to 15 move the player to \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 8\\) respectively, all safe.\n- At turn 16, the player is at \\(y = 8\\) (safe, as freeway 8 is unsafe only at turn 7). Choosing \\(U\\) moves to \\(y = 9\\) for turn 17.\n- At turn 17, the player is at \\(y = 9\\) (safe, as no cars are on \\(y = 9\\)). The last action \\(S\\) is chosen to satisfy the sequence length \\(H = 11\\), but the goal is already achieved at the start of turn 17.\n\nThe sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at the start of turn 17 (\\(t_1 + H - 1 = 7 + 11 - 1 = 17\\)) and avoids all collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 7: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 15: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 17: \\text{ S}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) at turn 8 to (0,9) as quickly as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The cars are moving, and I have to make sure that when I'm on a freeway row, there's no car covering position x=0 at that turn.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. For left-moving cars, the span shifts left by s per turn, and for right-moving, it shifts right by s per turn. Since the collision happens only if at the turn T, when I'm on y_T, and 0 is in the span of a car on that freeway.\n\nAlso, note that when I move to a new row, I'm not on that row until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9, which is probably the top, and since y=0 to 9, y=9 might be safe or the finish line; the problem says reach (0,9), and collisions are only with cars on y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe. y=0 is the starting point, and y=9 is the target, so no cars there, I assume.\n\nIn the car state, it's given for freeways 1 to 8, so y=1 to 8 have cars, y=0 and y=9 should be car-free.\n\nNow, I need to find a sequence of actions: U, D, or S, to move up, down, or stay, but since I start at y=0 and need to get to y=9, I probably want to go up as much as possible, but I have to avoid the cars.\n\nEach move changes y by +1, -1, or 0, with bounds, so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nStart at turn t1=8, position (0,0).\n\nI need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their positions at turn t=8, since that's the current turn.\n\nt1=8 is given, so at turn 8.\n\nFor each freeway, there are cars with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: left or right.\n\nFor left-moving cars, head and tail: in the span, it's [h, τ], and since it's moving left, h decreases over time.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, [τ, h], with τ increasing.\n\nIn the description:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → at T, [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, the head is on the left, I think.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: [τ, h] → [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nNow, for collision: at turn T, if I'm on freeway y, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in the span at that turn.\n\nSpan meaning the interval covered by the car.\n\nFor left-moving, span is [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], and since it's moving left, if h and τ are given, with h > τ probably, because head is left.\n\nIn the first one, for freeway 1: (-24,11,left,36)\n\nh = -24, τ = 11, so at t1=8, span is [-24,11]\n\nSince left-moving, as ΔT increases, both decrease, so it moves left.\n\nBut -24 to 11, that's from left to right? -24 is left, 11 is right, so if it's moving left, the whole thing shifts left.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, it shifts right.\n\nIn freeway 3, for example: (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nDirection right, so [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? Let's see the notation.\n\nIn the car state, it's listed as (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor left-moving, it's (h, τ) with Span = [h, τ]\n\nFor right-moving, it's (τ, h) with Span = [τ, h]? I think I'm confusing.\n\nLook at the description:\n\nFor car on freeway i: (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nThen for left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ]\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h]\n\nIn the text: \"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ]\"\n\n\"Right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h]\"\n\nYes.\n\nSo for left-moving, span is [h, τ] with h and τ, and it moves left, so at T, [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nSimilarly, right-moving, [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nNow, for freeway 1: (h, τ, d, s) = (-24, 11, left, 36)\n\nSo at t1=8, span = [h, τ] = [-24, 11]\n\nSince left-moving, at time T, span = [-24 - 36(T-8), 11 - 36(T-8)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, (-24,11,left,36), so identical.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: (-48,-59,right,12), (36,25,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFor right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h]\n\nSo first car: τ = -59, h = -48? (head, tail, dir, speed) = (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nSince right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (36,25,right,12), so τ=25, h=36? (head, tail) given, but for right-moving, span is [τ, h] = [25,36]? Let's see.\n\nThe tuple is (head, tail, dir, speed)\n\nFor right-moving, dir right, so Span(t1) = [tail, head] = [τ, h]\n\nSo for (36,25,right,12), h=36, τ=25, so [τ, h] = [25,36]\n\nBut 25 to 36, that seems fine.\n\nThird car: (0,-11,right,12), so h=0, τ=-11, dir right, so span = [τ, h] = [-11,0]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 and 5 have the same cars as freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 4: same as 3, (-48,-59,right,12), (36,25,right,12), (0,-11,right,12)\n\nFreeway 5: same.\n\nThen freeway 6: (60,49,right,6)\n\nRight-moving, so span at t1=8: [τ, h] = [49,60]\n\nh=60, τ=49, so [49,60]\n\nFreeway 7: same as 6, (60,49,right,6)\n\nFreeway 8: (60,49,right,6), and (12,1,right,6)\n\nFirst car: (60,49,right,6) span [49,60]\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,6) span [1,12]? τ=1, h=12, so [1,12]\n\nNow, I need to find when these cars have 0 in their span at various turns.\n\nBut I need for each freeway and each turn, whether position x=0 is occupied by a car.\n\nSince I'm only at x=0, I care only about when 0 is in the span for a car on the row I'm on.\n\nAlso, the span changes over time as cars move.\n\nLet ΔT = T - t1 = T - 8\n\nFor a given freeway k, at turn T, there is a collision if for any car on k, 0 is in its span at T.\n\nThen I need to avoid that when I'm on that row at that turn.\n\nNow, let's find for each freeway, the times when it is blocked at x=0.\n\nStart with freeway 1: y=1\n\nCars: one car, (-24,11,left,36)\n\nSpan at T: [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] = [-24 - 36ΔT, 11 - 36ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -24 -36ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 11 -36ΔT\n\nSo -24 -36ΔT ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 11 -36ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -24 -36ΔT ≤ 0 => -36ΔT ≤ 24 => ΔT ≥ -24/36 = -2/3, but since ΔT ≥0, always true for T≥8.\n\nΔT = T-8 ≥0, so -24 -36ΔT ≤ 0 is always true since both negative.\n\n-24 -36ΔT ≤ 0: since ΔT≥0, -36ΔT ≤0, so -24 + negative ≤0, yes always true.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ 11 -36ΔT => 36ΔT ≤ 11 => ΔT ≤ 11/36 ≈ 0.305\n\nSo 0 ≤ 11 -36ΔT only if ΔT ≤ 11/36\n\nSince ΔT integer, T integer, I assume turns are integers.\n\nΔT = T - t1, integer.\n\nSo for freeway 1, 0 in span only if ΔT ≤ floor(11/36) = 0 since 11/36<1.\n\nΔT ≤ 11/36 ≈0.305, so for ΔT=0, which is T=8, 0 ≤ 11 -0 =11, yes.\n\nFor ΔT=1, 11-36= -25 <0, so 0 ≤ -25 false.\n\nSo only at T=8, 0 is in span for freeway 1.\n\nBut T=8 is the current turn, and I'm at y=0, not on freeway 1, so at T=8, if I were on y=1, I would collide, but I'm not, so it's fine.\n\nFor T>8, no collision on freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 is same as freeway 1, so only blocked at T=8.\n\nNow freeway 3: y=3\n\nCars: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nRight-moving, span at T: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-59 +12ΔT, -48 +12ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -59 +12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -48 +12ΔT\n\nSo two inequalities:\n\n-59 +12ΔT ≤ 0 => 12ΔT ≤ 59 => ΔT ≤ 59/12 ≈ 4.916, so ΔT ≤ 4\n\nAnd 0 ≤ -48 +12ΔT => 48 ≤ 12ΔT => ΔT ≥ 48/12 = 4\n\nSo ΔT ≥4 and ΔT ≤4, so only at ΔT=4, T=8+4=12\n\nAt T=12, span: -59 +12*4 = -59+48= -11, -48+48=0, so [-11,0], so 0 in span.\n\nFor other ΔT, not.\n\nSecond car on freeway 3: (36,25,right,12)\n\nSpan at T: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [25 +12ΔT, 36 +12ΔT]\n\n0 in [25+12ΔT, 36+12ΔT]? Since 25+12ΔT ≥25>0 for ΔT≥0, so 0 < lower bound, so 0 not in span, ever.\n\nThird car: (0,-11,right,12)\n\nSpan at T: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-11 +12ΔT, 0 +12ΔT] = [-11+12ΔT, 12ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -11+12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 12ΔT\n\nFirst: -11+12ΔT ≤ 0 => 12ΔT ≤11 => ΔT ≤ 11/12 <1, so ΔT=0\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ 12ΔT, always for ΔT≥0.\n\nSo at ΔT=0, T=8, 0 in [ -11, 0 ], yes.\n\nFor ΔT>0, lower bound -11+12ΔT, at ΔT=1, -11+12=1>0, so span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 3, blocked when:\n\nAt T=8 (ΔT=0) by third car.\n\nAt T=12 (ΔT=4) by first car.\n\nNot blocked otherwise.\n\nFreeway 4 and 5 same as 3, so same blocking times.\n\nNow freeway 6: y=6\n\nCars: one car, (60,49,right,6)\n\nRight-moving, span at T: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [49 +6ΔT, 60 +6ΔT]\n\n0 in span? 49+6ΔT ≥49>0, so never, since lower bound >0.\n\nSimilarly freeway 7 same, no blocking at x=0.\n\nFreeway 8: y=8\n\nCars: two cars.\n\nFirst: (60,49,right,6) same as above, span [49+6ΔT, 60+6ΔT] >0, never 0.\n\nSecond: (12,1,right,6)\n\nSpan at T: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [1 +6ΔT, 12 +6ΔT]\n\n0 in span? 1+6ΔT ≥1>0, so never, lower bound >0.\n\nSo for freeway 8, no car ever at x=0.\n\nIs that right? [1+6ΔT, 12+6ΔT] ≥1, so 0 not in, yes.\n\nSo summary of blocking:\n\nFreeway y=1: blocked only at T=8\n\ny=2: same as y=1, only at T=8\n\ny=3: blocked at T=8 and T=12\n\ny=4: same as y=3, T=8 and T=12\n\ny=5: same, T=8 and T=12\n\ny=6: never blocked\n\ny=7: never blocked\n\ny=8: never blocked\n\nAnd y=0 and y=9 no cars, always safe.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 at T=8 to y=9 as fast as possible.\n\nSince I start at T=8, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nEach move I can change y by -1,0,+1.\n\nMinimal turns: since y from 0 to 9, I need at least 9 moves up, but I can stay or go down, so H at least 9.\n\nBut I might need to wait to avoid collisions.\n\nNow, the blocking times: at T=8, freeways y=1,2,3,4,5 are blocked, but I'm at y=0, so at T=8, I can stay or move.\n\nIf I move up to y=1 at T=8, but at T=8, y=1 is blocked, so if I go to y=1 at turn T=8, I arrive at y=1 at turn T+1? Let's see the timing.\n\nPlayer update: at turn t, I choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at turn t, I am at position (0, y_t), and I choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision: at turn T, if I am on freeway y_T, and 0 is in span for some car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nSo at turn T, my position y_T determines which freeway I'm on.\n\nWhen I choose action at turn T, I move to y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nAt turn T=8, I am at y=0.\n\nNow, y=0 is safe, no cars.\n\nI choose action a_8: U, D, or S.\n\nIf U, y_{9} = 1\n\nIf S, y_{9} = 0\n\nIf D, y_{9} = 0 (since y=0, can't go down, I assume, but y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if at y=0 and D, y_{t+1} = max(0, y_t -1) =0, so stay.\n\nSimilarly at y=9, U would stay.\n\nBut here y=0.\n\nNow, at turn T=8, I'm on y=0, safe.\n\nIf I go up to y=1 at turn 9.\n\nAt turn 9, I would be on y=1 if I chose U at t=8.\n\nBut at turn 9, is y=1 blocked?\n\nFreeway y=1 is blocked only at T=8, as we saw.\n\nAt T=9, ΔT=1, for y=1, span was [-24 -36(1), 11-36(1)] = [-60,-25], 0 not in, so safe at T=9.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 same.\n\nBut y=3,4,5 blocked at T=8 and T=12.\n\nT=8 and T=12.\n\nT=9 is not blocked for y=3,4,5.\n\nAt T=9, for y=3, ΔT=1, first car: [-59+12(1), -48+12(1)] = [-47,-36], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [25+12,36+12]=[37,48], not.\n\nThird car: [-11+12, 0+12]=[1,12], 0 not in. So yes, safe at T=9 for all rows except possibly, but we have no blocking at T=9.\n\nOnly specific times blocked.\n\nNow, I need to avoid being on a row when it is blocked.\n\nFor y=3,4,5, blocked at T=12.\n\nSo at turn 12, if I am on y=3,4, or 5, I collide.\n\nSimilarly, at T=8, but I'm not on those.\n\nNow, to minimize H, I want to go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut I need to not be on y=3,4,5 at T=12.\n\nT=12 is a critical point.\n\nAlso, y=6,7,8 always safe.\n\ny=1 and 2 safe except at T=8, but T=8 past.\n\nNow, let's plan the path.\n\nStart at T=8, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal steps: if I go up every turn, I can reach in 9 turns: from T=8 to T=16? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t, y_t.\n\nt=8: y=0\n\nAfter action, y_{t+1}\n\nSo after H actions, at turn t1 + H, I am at y_{t1 + H}\n\nt1=8, I start at turn 8, y_8=0.\n\nAfter action a_8, y_9 set.\n\nAfter a_9, y_10 set, ..., after a_{t1 + H -1}, y_{t1 + H} set.\n\nI want y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nAnd H minimal.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, I am at position.\n\nSequence of actions from t=8 to t=8+H-1, H actions, to reach at turn t=8+H.\n\ny_{8+H} =9.\n\nWith y starting at 0, after H moves, each move changes y by at most 1, so to reach 9, H at least 9.\n\nIf I go up every step, H=9, y_{17} =9? Let's index.\n\nt=8: y=0\n\nAfter a_8: y_9 = y8 + Δy8\n\nIf a_8=U, y9=1\n\nThen a_9=U, y10=2\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{16}, if all U, y17 = y8 + 9 =9? From t=8 to t=17, that's 9 steps.\n\nt=8: before action\n\nAfter a_8, at t=9, y9\n\nAfter a_9, at t=10, y10\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{k}, at t=k+1, y_{k+1}\n\nSet k from t to t+H-1 for actions.\n\nActions: a_t for t from t1 to t1 + H -1\n\nThen position at turn T: for T from t1 to t1 + H -1, y_T, and at T=t1 + H, y_{t1 + H}\n\nAt turn t1, I am at y_{t1}, before any action.\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, I move to y_{t1 +1} at turn t1+1.\n\nI want to be at y=9 at some turn T.\n\nThe turn when I reach y=9.\n\nI need y_T =9 for some T >= t1.\n\nAnd T - t1 +1? Let's define.\n\nThe minimal H such that after H actions, y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nActions: a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H -1}, H actions.\n\nThen y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nH is the number of actions.\n\nTime from start to finish: from turn t1 to turn t1 + H, with H actions.\n\nBut at turn t1, I am at start, no action yet.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, I am at y=9.\n\nThe time elapsed is H turns, but since I act each turn, number of actions is H.\n\nIn terms of turns, I start at turn t1, and end at turn t1 + H.\n\nFor example, if H=0, but I need to reach 9, H=0 not possible.\n\nMin H=9.\n\nWith H=9, I can reach at turn t1+9=17.\n\ny_{17}=9.\n\nNow, during the path, I need that for each turn T from t1 to t1+H-1, when I am at y_T, it is not blocked at that turn.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T, and I need no collision, meaning that for freeway y_T, at turn T, 0 not in any car span.\n\nThen at turn t1+H, I am at y=9, which is safe.\n\nIn this case, at turn T, I am on the freeway only if y_T between 1 and 8; at y=0 or 9, no issue.\n\nNow, back to the plan.\n\nI want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on y=3,4,5 at T=12.\n\nT=12 is turn 12.\n\nt1=8, so turn 12 is t1 + 4, since 8+4=12.\n\nNow, if I go directly up:\n\nSuppose I go U every turn from t=8 to t=16.\n\nThen:\n\nTurn T: | y_T\n8: 0\n9: 1 (after a8=U)\n10: 2\n11: 3\n12: 4\n13: 5\n14: 6\n15: 7\n16: 8\n17: 9 (after a16=U)\n\nAt turn 11, y=3, which is freeway 3, at T=11.\n\nIs it blocked? T=11, which is not 12, so for y=3, blocked at T=8 and T=12, not T=11.\n\nSimilarly, at T=12, y=4, which is blocked.\n\nAt T=12, y=4, and y=4 is blocked at T=12.\n\nCollision.\n\nSo at T=12, I am at y=4, which is blocked.\n\nNot good.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 at T=13? In this sequence, T=12 y=4, T=13 y=5.\n\ny=5 blocked at T=12, but T=12 is when y=4 is on, and blocked.\n\nBut y=5 at T=13, which is not T=12, so not blocked.\n\nBut at T=12, y=4 blocked, so I need to not be on y=4 at T=12.\n\nAlso, not on y=3 or y=5 at T=12.\n\nIn the direct path, at T=12, I am at y=4, blocked.\n\nSo I need to avoid that.\n\nI could delay or something.\n\nSince y=6,7,8 are always safe, and y=1,2 safe after T=8.\n\nThe problem is only at T=12 for y=3,4,5.\n\nT=12 is turn 12.\n\nI need to not be on rows 3,4,5 at turn 12.\n\nThat means, at turn 12, I should be on y<3 or y>5.\n\ny=0,1,2 or y=6,7,8,9.\n\nBut y=9 is target, I might not be there yet.\n\nNow, since I start from y=0 at T=8.\n\nI need to reach y=9 asap.\n\nThe critical turn is T=12.\n\nI must be below 3 or above 5 at T=12.\n\nIf I go up fast, I might be above, or I can be below.\n\nFor example, if I stay low until after T=12.\n\nBut staying low might take more time.\n\nI could go up to y=5 or something before and wait, but y=3,4,5 are blocked at T=12, so I cannot be on them at that turn.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=2 at T=12, or y=6, etc.\n\nLet's see possible y at T=12.\n\nFrom T=8 to T=12, that's 4 turns: actions at t=8,9,10,11 determine y at T=12.\n\ny_{12} = y_8 + sum_{t=8 to 11} Δy_t\n\ny_8=0, each Δy_t in {-1,0,1}, so y_12 between 0 and 4, since 4 steps up max.\n\nIn 4 actions, from t=8 to t=11, y_12 can be from 0 to 4.\n\nCannot be 5 or above in 4 steps.\n\nSimilarly, min 0.\n\nSo at T=12, possible y: 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nBut y=3 and y=4 are blocked, so I must be at y=0,1, or 2 at T=12.\n\ny=0,1,2 are safe at T=12, since not blocked.\n\ny=1 and 2 blocked only at T=8, not T=12.\n\ny=0 always safe.\n\nSo at T=12, I need to be on y=0,1, or 2.\n\nThen after that, I need to go to y=9.\n\nFrom y=2 at T=12, to y=9, I need at least 7 more steps: to y=3 at T=13, y=4 at T=14, ..., y=9 at T=19? Let's see.\n\nAt T=12, y=2.\n\nThen after actions:\n\nIf I go up:\n\na12: U, y13=3\n\na13: U, y14=4\n\na14: U, y15=5\n\na15: U, y16=6\n\na16: U, y17=7\n\na17: U, y18=8\n\na18: U, y19=9\n\nSo at T=19, y=9, with actions from t=12 to t=18, 7 actions.\n\nBut total from start: from t=8 to t=18, 11 actions? Actions from t=8 to t=18 inclusive? No.\n\nActions: a_t for t from t1 to t1+H-1, here t1=8.\n\nTo reach y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nAt T=12, y=2, which is after 4 actions from start? Let's count.\n\nStart: t=8, y8=0\n\nAfter a8: y9\n\n...\n\nAfter a11: y12\n\nSo to have y12=2, I used 4 actions: a8 to a11.\n\nThen from y12=2, I need to go to y=9, which takes at least 7 actions: a12 to a18, y19=9.\n\nSo total actions: a8 to a18, 11 actions, H=11.\n\nBut at T=13, y=3, etc.\n\nBut y=3,4,5 blocked only at T=12, not other times, so at T=13, y=3 is safe, similarly.\n\nIn this case, at T=13, y=3, freeway 3 at T=13, not blocked, as we saw earlier.\n\nSimilarly, no problem.\n\nBut H=11, but is this minimal?\n\nPerhaps I can be at higher y at T=12.\n\nBut earlier, at T=12, y can be at most 4, and y=4 is blocked, y=3 blocked, so I must be at y<=2 at T=12.\n\ny=2 is the highest I can be safely at T=12.\n\nWith y=2 at T=12, then to y=9 in 7 steps, total H=11 actions? Let's define H.\n\nNumber of actions to reach y=9.\n\nAfter H actions, y_{8+H} =9.\n\nIn this case, with y12=2, which is after 4 actions (a8 to a11), y12=2.\n\nThen I need y_{8+H} =9.\n\ny12 is at T=12, which is 8+4, so after 4 actions, position at T=12.\n\nThen from there, to reach y=9, the number of additional actions.\n\nAfter k additional actions, y_{12 + k} = y_{8+4 + k}\n\nSet y_{8+H} =9.\n\nIf y_{12} =2, then after m actions, y_{12+m} =9, so 2 + sum of m deltas, min m=7, y_{19}=9.\n\nThen T=19 = 8 + H, so 8+H=19, H=11.\n\nSimilarly, if I start with y12=0 or 1, it might take more.\n\nBut with y12=2, I need 7 more steps.\n\nCan I do better?\n\nPerhaps I don't need to be at y=2 at T=12; I could be at lower, but that might not help.\n\nMaybe I can be above y=5 at T=12, but earlier calculation, with 4 actions from start, max y=4, which is blocked, so impossible to be above 4 at T=12.\n\ny=4 is blocked, so must be <=2.\n\nSo minimal at T=12 is y=0,1,2, and y=2 is best for later.\n\nBut H=11 seems long.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster after T=12.\n\nBut from y=2 to y=9, 7 steps min.\n\nUnless I can reach y=9 earlier by not waiting.\n\nAnother idea: I could go down before T=12 to be low, but going down might waste time.\n\nFor example, suppose at some point I go down to stay low at T=12.\n\nBut since I need to go up, going down is counterproductive.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=6 or above at T=12, but impossible with 4 steps from y=0.\n\nMax y=4 at T=12.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, I must be at y<=2 at T=12, and then go up.\n\nBut with y=2 at T=12, H=11.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can reach faster.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 before T=12? But T=12 is only 4 turns after start, from y=0, max y=4 at T=12, which is less than 9, so impossible to reach before T=12.\n\nEarliest possible reach y=9 is at T=17 with direct up, but that collides at T=12.\n\nIn direct up, I can reach at T=17, but collides at T=12.\n\nTo avoid, I need to be low at T=12, so I must delay the ascent.\n\nThus, H=11 seems necessary.\n\nBut let's see if I can be at y=2 at T=12 with fewer actions or something.\n\nFrom start, to y12=2 in 4 actions: I need net +2 in 4 steps, so possible with two U and two S, or U U D S, etc., but since I need to avoid collisions during the path.\n\nIn the path to y12=2, I need to be safe at each turn.\n\nNow, the critical turns are T=8 to T=11 for the positions.\n\nAt T=8, I am at y=0, safe.\n\nThen I move to y9, etc.\n\nNow, during T=9 to T=11, I need to be on safe rows.\n\nFirst, what are the blocking times.\n\nFreeways:\n\ny=1: blocked only T=8\n\ny=2: only T=8\n\ny=3: blocked T=8 and T=12\n\nBut T=12 is later.\n\nFor T=9,10,11: all freeways are safe except possibly.\n\nAt T=9:\n\ny=1: not blocked, as we saw.\n\ny=2: not blocked\n\ny=3: not blocked (only T=8 and T=12)\n\nSimilarly y=4,5 same.\n\ny=6,7,8 always safe.\n\nSo at T=9,10,11, all rows are safe, no blocking at those times.\n\nOnly at T=8 and T=12 specific blocks.\n\nT=8: y=1,2,3,4,5 blocked, but I am at y=0 at T=8, so fine.\n\nT=12: y=3,4,5 blocked.\n\nFor turns T=9,10,11, all y are safe to be on.\n\nTherefore, when going to y12=2, I can be on any y at T=9,10,11 without problem.\n\nFor example, to reach y12=2 from y8=0 in 4 actions.\n\nPossible sequences:\n\n- Two U and two S, in some order.\n\nOr one U, one D, and two S, but D from y=0 might not change, but let's list actions.\n\ny start: T=8, y=0\n\nAfter a8: y9\n\nAfter a9: y10\n\nAfter a10: y11\n\nAfter a11: y12\n\nWe want y12=2.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0,+1.\n\nNet change from y8 to y12: +2 in 4 steps.\n\nSo sum of Δy from t=8 to 11 must be +2.\n\nEach Δy in {-1,0,1}, so possibilities: two +1 and two 0, or one +1 and three +1? Two +1 and two 0: net +2.\n\nOr three +1 and one -1: net +2.\n\nOr four +1: net +4>2, too much.\n\nOr one +1, one -1, two 0: net 0, not +2.\n\nSo only: (a) two U and two S: net +2\n\nOr (b) three U and one D: net +2\n\nNow, with two U and two S, y increases slowly.\n\nWith three U and one D, I go up faster but come down a bit.\n\nBut since I need to be low at T=12, y=2, both possible.\n\nNow, for minimal time to reach y=9 after, probably better to be higher earlier, but since after T=12 I go up, it might not matter much.\n\nBut let's first get to y=2 at T=12.\n\nThen from there to y=9.\n\nFirst, to have y12=2.\n\nI need to specify actions.\n\nSince no danger at T=9,10,11, I can choose any.\n\nBut I also need to minimize H, so after T=12, I go up as fast as possible.\n\nSo from T=12 y=2, I go U every turn to y=9 in 7 steps.\n\nNow, total actions: from t=8 to t=18, 11 actions.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut let's list the turns.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=2 earlier, but at T=12 I need to be there.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6,7,8 are always safe, I could go directly to them after T=12.\n\nBut with the delay.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=5 before T=12 and be safe, but at T=12, if I am on y=5, blocked, so I cannot.\n\nUnless I move away at T=12.\n\nBut at turn T=12, if I am on y=5, and I choose action, but the position at turn T=12 is y12, and collision is checked at that turn based on y12.\n\nThen after action, I move to y13.\n\nSo if at T=12 I am on y=5, and it is blocked, I collide, regardless of what I do next.\n\nSo I must not be on y=3,4,5 at T=12.\n\nThus, must be at y<=2 or y>=6, but y>=6 impossible at T=12.\n\nSo y<=2 at T=12.\n\nThus, minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let's confirm the sequence.\n\nFirst, to have y12=2.\n\nI need actions from t=8 to t=11.\n\nFor example, one way: go up twice, then stay twice.\n\na8=U, y9=1\n\na9=U, y10=2\n\na10=S, y11=2\n\na11=S, y12=2\n\nAt T=9, y=1, which is safe (not blocked at T=9)\n\nT=10, y=2, safe\n\nT=11, y=2, safe\n\nT=12, y=2, safe\n\nThen from there, go up:\n\na12=U, y13=3\n\na13=U, y14=4\n\na14=U, y15=5\n\na15=U, y16=6\n\na16=U, y17=7\n\na17=U, y18=8\n\na18=U, y19=9\n\nAt T=13, y=3, freeway 3 at T=13, which is not blocked (only T=8 and T=12 blocked)\n\nSimilarly, T=14 y=4, safe\n\nT=15 y=5, safe\n\nT=16 y=6, safe, and so on.\n\nAll good.\n\nH=11 actions: from t=8 to t=18.\n\nt=8 to t=18 inclusive? Actions a_t for t from 8 to 18, that's 11 actions: t=8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18.\n\nThen y at t=19=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=8 to t=18, that's 11 values, H=11.\n\nTo reach at turn 19.\n\nCan I do with H=10?\n\nIf H=10, then y_{18}=9.\n\nBut at T=12, I need to be at y<=2.\n\ny_{12} <=2.\n\nFrom y8=0 to y18=9, in 10 steps.\n\nNet change +9 in 10 steps.\n\nAt T=12, y12 <=2.\n\ny12 is after 4 actions from start, y12 <=2.\n\nThen from y12 to y18, 6 actions, to go from <=2 to 9, min change +7, but in 6 steps, max change +6, so y18 <= y12 +6 <=2+6=8 <9, impossible.\n\ny12 <=2, after 4 actions.\n\nThen from y12 to y18, 6 actions (a12 to a17, y18).\n\nEach action changes by at most +1, so y18 <= y12 +6 <=2+6=8 <9.\n\nCannot reach y=9 with 6 actions from y<=2.\n\nThus, impossible with H=10.\n\nSimilarly, with H=11, y12 <=2, then y12 +7 <=9, possible if y12=2.\n\nIf y12=1, then y12+8=9, but from y12=1 to y18=9 in 6 actions, max y18=1+6=7<9, impossible.\n\ny18= y12 + sum_{t=12 to 17} Δy_t <= y12 +6\n\nTo have y18=9, need y12 +6 >=9, so y12 >=3.\n\nBut earlier, to avoid collision, at T=12, y12 <=2.\n\nContradiction.\n\nTherefore, with H=10, impossible.\n\nSimilarly, H=11 is minimal.\n\nWith H=11, y_{19}=9.\n\nAnd y12 must be 2 for minimal, or less, but y12=2 allows y19=9.\n\nIf y12=1, then to y19=9, need +8 in 7 actions (from t=12 to t=18, 7 actions), possible, but y19= y12 +7? After 7 actions, y19= y12 + sum_{t=12 to 18} Δy_t, max y19= y12 +7.\n\nIf y12=1, max y19=8<9, cannot reach 9.\n\ny12=1, after 4 actions from start.\n\nThen actions a12 to a18: 7 actions, y19 = y12 + sum_{t=12 to 18} Δy_t\n\nSince Δy <=1, y19 <= y12 +7 <=1+7=8<9, cannot reach 9.\n\nSimilarly, if y12=0, y19<=7<9.\n\nOnly if y12=2, y19 <=2+7=9, and can be 9 if all U.\n\nThus, for H=11, y12 must be 2.\n\nThen all actions after must be U.\n\nNow, to have y12=2, with the actions.\n\nIn the sequence above, I have a10=S and a11=S, so I stayed at y=2 for two turns.\n\nBut I could have reached y=2 earlier.\n\nFor example, with three U and one D.\n\ny8=0\n\na8=U, y9=1\n\na9=U, y10=2\n\na10=U, y11=3\n\nBut at T=11, y=3, which is safe, since not blocked at T=11.\n\nThen to have y12=2, I need to go down: a11=D, y12=2\n\nThen proceed.\n\nThen from y12=2, a12=U, y13=3, etc. to y19=9.\n\nNow, in this case, at T=11, I was at y=3, which is fine.\n\nThen at T=12, y=2, fine.\n\nNow, compared to previous, I used one more U and one D, but same net.\n\nBut in terms of position, I was at y=3 at T=11, which is higher, but since I have to go down to y=2 at T=12, it might not save time.\n\nTotal H same.\n\nTo minimize H, since H=11 fixed, it doesn't matter.\n\nBut in the sequence, I need to output actions.\n\nNow, for the actions before, I can choose.\n\nBut in the first sequence, I had two S at y=2, which might be unnecessary, but it works.\n\nWith the U and D, I can have fewer stay, but D might not be efficient.\n\nSince no issue, I can choose either.\n\nBut perhaps for simplicity, I can go up directly but adjust at T=11.\n\nNow, back to the car state, I think I have all.\n\nFreeway 8 has cars, but they never at x=0, so safe.\n\nIn the sequence, when I go to y=6,7,8, all safe.\n\nIn the output, I need the sequence of actions from turn t1=8.\n\nSo for the minimal path, H=11.\n\nActions:\n\nTo have y12=2.\n\nOne option:\n\nTurn 8: U  (y9=1)\n\nTurn 9: U  (y10=2)\n\nTurn 10: S  (y11=2)  // stay\n\nTurn 11: S  (y12=2)  // stay\n\nThen\n\nTurn 12: U  (y13=3)\n\nTurn 13: U  (y14=4)\n\nTurn 14: U  (y15=5)\n\nTurn 15: U  (y16=6)\n\nTurn 16: U  (y17=7)\n\nTurn 17: U  (y18=8)\n\nTurn 18: U  (y19=9)\n\nActions from t=8 to t=18.\n\nt=8 to t=18, 11 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 10 and 11, I stayed, but I could have:\n\nTurn 8: U (y9=1)\n\nTurn 9: U (y10=2)\n\nTurn 10: U (y11=3)\n\nTurn 11: D (y12=2)\n\nThen turn 12: U (y13=3)\n\netc.\n\nSame.\n\nIn this case, at turn 11, I go down, which might not be necessary, but it works.\n\nThe first sequence with stay might be simpler.\n\nBut both fine.\n\nNow, in the output, I need to list for each turn.\n\nAlso, the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\", so t from 0 to H-1, meaning a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1}.\n\nWith H=11.\n\nNow, but let's confirm the car on freeway 3, etc., at other times.\n\nFor example, at T=13, y=3, freeway 3.\n\nAt T=13, ΔT=5, for first car: [-59 +12*5, -48 +12*5] = [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [25+60,36+60]=[85,96], no.\n\nThird car: [-11+60, 0+60]=[49,60], no.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\ny=4 and y=5 same as y=3 for blocking, but only at T=12, not other times.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11.\n\nBut is there a way with H=10? We saw impossible.\n\nPerhaps I can be at y=9 at an earlier turn by not going through the middle at bad times, but since I must pass the rows, and the only bad time is T=12 for rows 3-5, and I have to be below at that time.\n\nPerhaps I can go up to y=5 before T=12, but then at T=12 I need to not be there, so I have to move away, but since I can only change by one, if at T=11 I am at y=4, then at T=12 I could go to y=5 or y=3 or stay, but y=3,4,5 all blocked at T=12, so if I am at y=4 at T=11, and I go to y=5 at T=12, at T=12 I am on y=5, blocked.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=3, on y=3 blocked.\n\nIf I stay, on y=4 blocked.\n\nSo impossible to be on y=3,4,5 at T=11 if I want to avoid T=12, but at T=11, y=3,4,5 are safe, only at T=12 blocked.\n\nBut when I am at T=12, I will be on one of them if I am around.\n\nUnless I am below or above.\n\nBut above not possible.\n\nSo must be below at T=12.\n\nThus, no better way.\n\nSo H=11 is minimal.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I can output the first one.\n\nBut in the answer format, I need to list actions.\n\nAlso, the player position at start is (0,0), and we need to reach (0,9).\n\nIn the actions, I used only U and S, no D, except in the alternative.\n\nBut with D, it might be fine.\n\nTo avoid down, I can use the stay.\n\nNow, another thing: in freeway 8, there is a car at (12,1,right,6), but since it moves right, and span [1+6ΔT,12+6ΔT], at T=8, [1,12], etc., all positive, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nTherefore, the sequence:\n\nTurn 8: U\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: S\n\nTurn 11: S\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nActions from t=8 to t=18.\n\nt=8 to t=18, that's 11 turns.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t1=8 to t1+10=18, since H=11, t from 0 to 10, t1 + t from 8 to 18.\n\nYes.\n\nWith this, y at turn 19=9.\n\nBut to write in the box.\n\nThe answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 8: U \\\\ Turn 9: U \\\\ Turn 10: S \\\\ Turn 11: S \\\\ Turn 12: U \\\\ Turn 13: U \\\\ Turn 14: U \\\\ Turn 15: U \\\\ Turn 16: U \\\\ Turn 17: U \\\\ Turn 18: U }\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 10 and 11, I stayed at y=2, which is fine.\n\nI could have gone up and down, but not necessary.\n\nNow, but in the beginning, I thought about freeway 3,4,5 having cars, but I handled.\n\nAnother point: in freeway 3,4,5, there is a car at (0,-11,right,12) at t1=8, which has span [-11,0] at T=8, so at x=0, but since I am not on that row, fine.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 8\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the strategy must account for the car movements and blocking times.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- **Blocking Times**: \n  - Freeways \\(y = 1\\) and \\(y = 2\\) are blocked only at turn \\(T = 8\\).\n  - Freeways \\(y = 3\\), \\(y = 4\\), and \\(y = 5\\) are blocked at turns \\(T = 8\\) and \\(T = 12\\).\n  - Freeways \\(y = 6\\), \\(y = 7\\), and \\(y = 8\\) are never blocked at \\(x = 0\\).\n- **Constraints at \\(T = 12\\)**: To avoid collision, the player must not be on freeways \\(y = 3\\), \\(y = 4\\), or \\(y = 5\\) at turn \\(T = 12\\). Given that only 4 actions are available from turn 8 to turn 11 (determining \\(y_{12}\\)), the maximum achievable \\(y\\) at turn 12 is 4. However, \\(y = 3\\) and \\(y = 4\\) are blocked, so the player must be at \\(y \\leq 2\\) at turn 12.\n- **Minimal Turns**: \n  - Starting from \\(y_8 = 0\\), reaching \\(y = 9\\) requires at least 9 upward moves. \n  - With the constraint at \\(T = 12\\), the player must delay progress to stay at \\(y \\leq 2\\) at turn 12. \n  - From \\(y_{12} = 2\\), it takes at least 7 more upward moves to reach \\(y = 9\\), resulting in a minimum of 11 total actions (turns 8 to 18) to reach \\(y_{19} = 9\\).\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence minimizes \\(H\\) by:\n- Moving up to \\(y = 2\\) by turn 10.\n- Staying at \\(y = 2\\) for turns 10 and 11 to ensure \\(y_{12} = 2\\) (safe at \\(T = 12\\)).\n- Moving up continuously from turn 12 to turn 18 to reach \\(y = 9\\) at turn 19.\n\nActions:\n- Turn 8: U → \\(y_9 = 1\\) (safe, as \\(y = 1\\) is only blocked at \\(T = 8\\) and player is at \\(y = 1\\) at \\(T = 9\\)).\n- Turn 9: U → \\(y_{10} = 2\\) (safe, as \\(y = 2\\) is only blocked at \\(T = 8\\)).\n- Turn 10: S → \\(y_{11} = 2\\) (safe, no blocking at \\(T = 11\\) for any row).\n- Turn 11: S → \\(y_{12} = 2\\) (safe, \\(y = 2\\) not blocked at \\(T = 12\\)).\n- Turn 12: U → \\(y_{13} = 3\\) (safe, \\(y = 3\\) blocked only at \\(T = 8\\) and \\(T = 12\\)).\n- Turn 13: U → \\(y_{14} = 4\\) (safe, \\(y = 4\\) blocked only at \\(T = 8\\) and \\(T = 12\\)).\n- Turn 14: U → \\(y_{15} = 5\\) (safe, \\(y = 5\\) blocked only at \\(T = 8\\) and \\(T = 12\\)).\n- Turn 15: U → \\(y_{16} = 6\\) (safe, \\(y = 6\\) never blocked).\n- Turn 16: U → \\(y_{17} = 7\\) (safe, \\(y = 7\\) never blocked).\n- Turn 17: U → \\(y_{18} = 8\\) (safe, \\(y = 8\\) never blocked).\n- Turn 18: U → \\(y_{19} = 9\\) (target reached, \\(y = 9\\) has no cars).\n\n### Verification:\n- **Collision Avoidance**: \n  - Turns 9-11: Player is on \\(y = 1\\), \\(y = 2\\), or \\(y = 2\\), all safe at these times.\n  - Turn 12: Player is on \\(y = 2\\), safe.\n  - Turns 13-15: Player is on \\(y = 3\\), \\(y = 4\\), or \\(y = 5\\), but these are only blocked at \\(T = 12\\), so safe at \\(T = 13\\), \\(14\\), and \\(15\\).\n  - Turns 16-18: Player is on \\(y = 6\\), \\(y = 7\\), or \\(y = 8\\), always safe.\n- **Efficiency**: \\(H = 11\\) is minimal, as \\(H = 10\\) is impossible due to the \\(T = 12\\) constraint (player cannot reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 18 if \\(y_{12} \\leq 2\\)).\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 8: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 9: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: \\text{ U} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,1) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 9, and I'm at y=1.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements. Cars move left or right at their speeds, and I need to make sure that when I'm on a freeway row at a certain turn, there's no car that covers position x=0 at that exact turn.\n\nThe collision rule says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\" And y_T is the row I'm on at turn T.\n\nAlso, note that when I move to a new row, I'm not on that row until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1.\n\nThe player position update is: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on the action at turn t.\n\nSo at turn t, I choose action a_t, which determines Δy_t, and then y_{t+1} is set based on that.\n\nAnd collision is checked at each turn T based on y_T and the cars on that freeway at turn T.\n\nNow, for the cars, they move continuously based on their speed and direction.\n\nLet me list all the cars and their positions at turn t_1 = 9.\n\nFirst, for freeway 1: one car, head -60, tail -25, direction left, speed 36.\n\nSince it's left-moving, the span at time T is [h - s(T - t_1), τ - s(T - t_1)]\n\nt_1 is 9, so for any T, Span(T) = [ -60 - 36(T - 9), -25 - 36(T - 9) ] for freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 is the same: (-60, -25, left, 36), so same as freeway 1.\n\nNow freeway 3 has three cars:\n\nFirst: (-36, -47, right, 12) — head and tail seem swapped? Let me read.\n\n\"head h, tail τ\", and for right-moving, it says span [τ, h] and then [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, it's given as (head h, tail τ, direction, speed)\n\nFor left-moving, head is larger? No.\n\nLet's see the update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nRight-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nIn the car state, it's listed as (head h, tail τ, direction, speed)\n\nI think for consistency, head might be the front, but in the span, for left-moving, it's [h, τ] with h > τ probably, since moving left, head decreases.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nIn freeway 3, first car: (-36, -47, right, 12)\n\n-36 and -47, if head is -36, tail is -47, but -36 > -47, so if right-moving, head should be on the right, so h = -36, τ = -47, meaning head at -36, tail at -47, which is left of head? That doesn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps I misread.\n\nLet's see the notation.\n\nIn the car update, for right-moving, it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" and moves to [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nAnd in the state, it's given as (head h, tail τ)\n\nFor the first car on freeway 3: head h = -36, tail τ = -47\n\nSince it's right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-47, -36]\n\nBecause τ = -47, h = -36, and -47 < -36, so [ -47, -36 ] which is from left to right.\n\nThen at time T, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-47 + 12(T-9), -36 + 12(T-9)]\n\nSimilarly, second car on freeway 3: (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nHead 48, tail 37, right-moving, so span at t1: [τ, h] = [37, 48]\n\nAt T: [37 + 12(T-9), 48 + 12(T-9)]\n\nThird car: (12, 1, right, 12)\n\nSpan at t1: [1, 12] since τ=1, h=12\n\nAt T: [1 + 12(T-9), 12 + 12(T-9)]\n\nNow freeway 4: same as freeway 3? \"(-36, -47, right, 12), (48, 37, right, 12), (12, 1, right, 12)\" — identical to freeway 3.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5: same as 3 and 4.\n\nFreeway 6: one car (-48, -59, right, 6)\n\nHead -48, tail -59, right-moving, so span at t1: [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nAt T: [-59 + 6(T-9), -48 + 6(T-9)]\n\nFreeway 7: same as 6? \"(-48, -59, right, 6)\" — one car, same as freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: \"(-48, -59, right, 6), (18, 7, right, 6)\"\n\nFirst car same as above: span at t1: [-59, -48]\n\nAt T: [-59 + 6(T-9), -48 + 6(T-9)]\n\nSecond car: (18, 7, right, 6) head 18, tail 7, span at t1: [7, 18]\n\nAt T: [7 + 6(T-9), 18 + 6(T-9)]\n\nNow, I am at (0,1) at turn t=9, which is freeway y=1.\n\nFreeway y=1 has cars? From the table, freeway 1 has one car with the left-moving one.\n\nFreeway indices: y=1 to 8, so freeway k=1 to 8.\n\nAt turn 9, I'm on y=1.\n\nI need to go to y=9, which is not a freeway, y=9 is the top, no cars, so once I'm on y=9, I'm safe, I think. The freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 is the bottom, y=9 is the top.\n\nI start at (0,1), so on freeway 1.\n\nNow, for freeway 1 at turn 9: car with span [h, τ] for left-moving? Earlier.\n\nFreeway 1: left-moving, head h=-60, tail τ=-25, so span at t1=9: [h, τ] = [-60, -25]? But -60 < -25, so [ -60, -25 ] means from x=-60 to x=-25, which is increasing x, but left-moving? Inconsistency.\n\nLet's clarify the span notation.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\"\n\nWith h and τ, if it's left-moving, and head is at h, tail at τ, since moving left, head should be on the right, so h > τ, so [h, τ] with h > τ? But [h, τ] with h > τ would be decreasing, but in interval notation, [a,b] with a<b.\n\nI think there's a confusion in notation.\n\nIn mathematics, [a,b] denotes the interval from a to b, assuming a ≤ b.\n\nBut in the car update, for left-moving, it says Span(t1) = [h, τ], and then moves to [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT].\n\nIf h and τ are such that h > τ, then [h, τ] doesn't make sense as an interval; it should be [τ, h] if τ < h.\n\nI think there's a mistake in the description or my understanding.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\n\"Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\"\n\nBut if h and τ are coordinates, and for left-moving, the head is at higher x, tail at lower x, so if h is head, τ is tail, then h > τ, so Span should be [τ, h] to have increasing x.\n\nBut here it's written as [h, τ], which would imply h < τ if it's an interval.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\"\n\nHere [τ, h] suggests τ < h.\n\nIn the car state, for example, freeway 1: (-60, -25, left, 36), head h=-60, tail τ=-25.\n\n-60 < -25, so if [h, τ] = [-60, -25], that means from x=-60 to x=-25, which is increasing x, so moving to the right? But it says direction left, contradiction.\n\nPerhaps head and tail are defined with head being the front when moving.\n\nIf direction left, front is left, so at lower x, tail at higher x.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, front at higher x.\n\nLet's assume that for a car, head is the front, tail is the back.\n\nFor left-moving, front is left, so at smaller x, tail at larger x.\n\nSo for freeway 1, head h=-60, tail τ=-25, so front at x=-60, back at x=-25, so the car spans from x=-60 to x=-25.\n\nSince moving left, the front is at smaller x.\n\nSpan at t1: from min to max, so [ -60, -25 ] with -60 < -25.\n\nThen for left-moving, Span(T) = [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] = [-60 - 36ΔT, -25 - 36ΔT]\n\nSince moving left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, like freeway 3 first car: head h=-36, tail τ=-47.\n\nIf right-moving, front is right, so at larger x, tail at smaller x.\n\nSo head at -36, tail at -47, so front at -36, back at -47, so span from -47 to -36, with -47 < -36.\n\nSo span at t1: [ -47, -36 ]\n\nThen at T: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-47 + 12ΔT, -36 + 12ΔT]\n\nIn the description, for right-moving, it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" which matches [ -47, -36 ].\n\nFor left-moving, \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" which for freeway 1 is [ -60, -25 ], so h=-60, τ=-25, and [h,τ] = [-60,-25], which is fine since h < τ in this case? -60 < -25, so h < τ.\n\nIn general, for left-moving, head h < tail τ, so [h, τ] with h < τ.\n\nFor right-moving, head h > tail τ, so [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nIn the state, for freeway 1: (-60, -25, left, 36), h=-60, τ=-25, h < τ.\n\nFreeway 3 first car: (-36, -47, right, 12), h=-36, τ=-47, so h > τ since -36 > -47.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (48, 37, right, 12), h=48, τ=37, h > τ.\n\nThird car: (12,1, right,12), h=12, τ=1, h > τ.\n\nFreeway 6: (-48, -59, right,6), h=-48, τ=-59, so h > τ since -48 > -59.\n\nFreeway 8 second car: (18,7, right,6), h=18, τ=7, h > τ.\n\nFor left-moving like freeway 1, h < τ.\n\nOkay, that makes sense.\n\nSo to summarize:\n\nAt turn T, for a car on freeway k:\n\n- If left-moving: span = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] with h and τ as given, and for left-moving, h < τ typically? In freeway 1, h=-60, τ=-25, so h < τ.\n\nGenerally, for left-moving, span at T: [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] with h ≤ τ.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] with τ ≤ h.\n\nAnd collision if at turn T, for freeway y_T, 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nNow t1 = 9.\n\nI am at y=1 at turn 9.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as soon as possible with minimal H.\n\nActions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), S (stay, y same).\n\ny must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nSince I start at y=1 and need to go to y=9, I need to move up 8 rows. Each U action moves me up, but I can only move one step per turn, or stay, but staying doesn't help progress, so to minimize turns, I should always move up if possible, but I have to avoid collisions, so I might need to stay or even move down to dodge cars.\n\nBut moving down might increase H, so I should avoid that if possible.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t=9 to t=9+H-1, so after H turns, I am at turn 9+H-1, position y=9.\n\nLet me define the turn index.\n\nLet t = 0 be the current turn, so t_1 = 9, but to simplify, let me set τ = t - 9, so at τ=0, turn 9, y=1.\n\nThen at time τ, turn t = 9 + τ.\n\nPosition y_τ.\n\nI need to find minimal H such that at τ = H-1, y_{H-1} = 9.\n\ny_τ for τ from 0 to H-1.\n\nAt each step τ, I choose action a_τ, which determines y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy, with Δy = +1 for U, -1 for D, 0 for S.\n\nThen at each time τ, I am on row y_τ, and I check if 0 is in the span of any car on that row at time τ.\n\nThe cars are defined at time T = 9 + τ.\n\nFor a car on freeway k, at time T = 9 + τ, ΔT = (9+τ) - 9 = τ.\n\nSo span at time T is:\n\nFor left-moving car: span = [h - s τ, τ_car - s τ]  (τ_car is tail, but to avoid confusion, let's use t for tail)\n\nIn the notation, tail is τ, but τ is used for time, so let's use \"tail\" or something.\n\nIn the car state, let's denote for each car: head h, tail t, direction d, speed s.\n\nThen at time T = 9 + τ, the span is:\n\nIf d = left: [h - s τ, t - s τ]\n\nIf d = right: [t + s τ, h + s τ]\n\nAnd for freeway k, the cars are as given.\n\nNow I need for each row k=1 to 8, and for each time τ, whether position x=0 is occupied by a car on that row.\n\nThat is, for row k at time τ, if there is a car on k such that 0 in its span.\n\nThen when I am on row y at time τ, it must be that no car on row y has 0 in span at time τ.\n\nSince I start at τ=0, y=1, and I need to be at y=9 at some τ = H-1.\n\ny_9 is not a freeway, so no cars, always safe.\n\nSimilarly y=0 is safe, but I start from y=1, going to y=9, so I should not go to y=0, as it would waste moves.\n\nMinimal H: since I need to go from y=1 to y=9, the minimal possible H is 8, if I move up every turn: at τ=0, y=1, action U, y=2 at τ=1; ... up to y=9 at τ=8. So after 8 actions, at τ=8, y=9.\n\nBut I need to check if this path has collisions.\n\nThe path would be: at τ=0, y=1; τ=1, y=2; ... τ=7, y=8; τ=8, y=9.\n\nI need to check for each τ from 0 to 7, on row y_τ, if 0 is occupied at that time.\n\nAt τ=0, y=1, freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1 has one car: left-moving, h=-60, t=-25, s=36.\n\nAt τ=0, span = [h - s*0, t - s*0] = [-60, -25]\n\nIs 0 in [-60, -25]? -60 <= 0 <= -25? 0 <= -25 is false, -25 is negative, so 0 > -25, so 0 not in interval, since -60 to -25, all negative, 0 not included. So safe at τ=0, y=1.\n\nNow at τ=1, y=2, freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1, car (-60, -25, left, 36)\n\nAt τ=1, span = [ -60 -36*1, -25 -36*1 ] = [ -96, -61 ]\n\nAll negative, 0 not in, safe.\n\nτ=2, y=3, freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 3 has three cars.\n\nAt time τ=2, T=11, ΔT=2 from t1.\n\nFor each car:\n\nFirst car: right-moving, h=-36, t=-47, s=12\n\nSpan: [t + s τ, h + s τ] = [-47 + 12*2, -36 + 12*2] = [-47+24, -36+24] = [-23, -12]\n\n0 not in [-23,-12], all negative.\n\nSecond car: h=48, t=37, s=12, right\n\nSpan: [37 + 12*2, 48 + 12*2] = [37+24, 48+24] = [61, 72], all positive, 0 not in.\n\nThird car: h=12, t=1, s=12, right\n\nSpan: [1 + 12*2, 12 + 12*2] = [1+24, 12+24] = [25, 36], all positive, 0 not in.\n\nSo on freeway 3 at τ=2, no car at 0, safe.\n\nτ=3, y=4, freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 4 same as freeway 3: three cars identical.\n\nAt τ=3, spans:\n\nFirst car: [-47 + 12*3, -36 + 12*3] = [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11, 0]\n\n-11 to 0, so 0 is included? -11 <= 0 <= 0, yes, 0 is in [-11, 0].\n\nSo at τ=3, for freeway 4, first car has span [-11,0], so 0 is occupied.\n\nBut at τ=3, I would be on y=4 if I go straight up.\n\nIn the path, at τ=3, y=4, and freeway 4 has a car at 0, so collision.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be on freeway 4 at τ=3.\n\nSo the straight up path has a collision at τ=3 on y=4.\n\nThus, I need to avoid that.\n\nI could stay or move down at some point to shift the timing.\n\nNow, similarly, for other points.\n\nFirst, let's list for each freeway and each time, when 0 is occupied.\n\nI need to find for each k=1 to 8, and for τ >=0, the times when 0 is in some car span on row k.\n\nSince the cars move, the occupation is periodic or something, but with different speeds, it might be messy.\n\nSince I need to go through each row, and for each row, I need to be there at a time when it's safe.\n\nBut I can control the time by staying or moving down.\n\nSince I must go up 8 times, the minimal H is 8, but if not possible, H=9 or more.\n\nIn the straight up, collision at τ=3, y=4.\n\nSo I need to delay or advance my arrival on y=4.\n\nBut I start from y=1, so I can stay on y=1 or y=2, etc., to change the time.\n\nLet me first find for each row, the times when it is unsafe, i.e., 0 occupied.\n\nStart with freeway 1: k=1, one car, left-moving, h=-60, t=-25, s=36.\n\nSpan at τ: [ -60 -36τ, -25 -36τ ]\n\n0 in span if -60 -36τ <= 0 <= -25 -36τ\n\nSince -25 -36τ < 0 for all τ>=0, because -25-36τ <= -25 <0, so 0 > -25 -36τ always, so 0 cannot be <= right endpoint since right endpoint negative.\n\nSimilarly, left endpoint -60-36τ <0 always.\n\nSo 0 never in the interval because the interval is entirely negative for all τ. So freeway 1 is always safe. Good.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1, always safe.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars, but let's see when 0 is covered by any.\n\nFirst car: right-moving, h=-36, t=-47, s=12\n\nSpan: [ -47 +12τ, -36 +12τ ]\n\n0 in span if -47 +12τ <= 0 <= -36 +12τ\n\nWhich is 12τ <= 47 and 12τ >= 36? Let's solve inequalities.\n\nLeft: -47 +12τ <= 0 => 12τ <= 47 => τ <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916\n\nRight: 0 <= -36 +12τ => 12τ >= 36 => τ >= 3\n\nSo τ >= 3 and τ <= 3.916, so τ=3? Since τ integer, τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, span: [ -47+36, -36+36] = [-11, 0], so 0 included.\n\nAt other times, not.\n\nSecond car: h=48, t=37, s=12, right\n\nSpan: [37 +12τ, 48 +12τ]\n\nMin is 37+0=37>0, so always positive, 0 never in.\n\nThird car: h=12, t=1, s=12, right\n\nSpan: [1+12τ, 12+12τ] min 1>0, always positive, 0 never in.\n\nSo on freeway 3, only unsafe when first car at τ=3.\n\nOnly at τ=3, 0 is occupied.\n\nFreeway 4: same cars as freeway 3, so identical, unsafe only at τ=3.\n\nFreeway 5: same as 3 and 4, unsafe only at τ=3.\n\nNow freeway 6: one car, (-48, -59, right, 6) so h=-48, t=-59, s=6\n\nRight-moving, span: [t + s τ, h + s τ] = [-59 +6τ, -48 +6τ]\n\n0 in span if -59 +6τ <= 0 <= -48 +6τ\n\nLeft: -59+6τ <=0 => 6τ <=59 => τ <= 59/6 ≈9.833\n\nRight: 0 <= -48 +6τ => 6τ >=48 => τ >=8\n\nSo τ >=8 and τ <=9.833, so τ=8 or 9.\n\nAt τ=8: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11, 0], 0 in\n\nAt τ=9: [-59+54, -48+54] = [-5,6], 0 in since -5<=0<=6\n\nAt τ=7: [-59+42, -48+42] = [-17,-6], all neg, 0 not in\n\nτ=10: [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12], all pos, 0 not in\n\nSo unsafe at τ=8 and τ=9.\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway 6, one car identical, so unsafe at τ=8 and τ=9.\n\nNow freeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: same as freeway 6, (-48, -59, right, 6), so span [-59 +6τ, -48 +6τ], unsafe at τ=8,9 as above.\n\nSecond car: (18,7, right,6) h=18, t=7, s=6\n\nSpan: [7 +6τ, 18 +6τ]\n\nMin 7>0, always positive, so 0 never in.\n\nSo only the first car matters for occupation at 0.\n\nThus freeway 8 unsafe at τ=8 and τ=9.\n\nNow, summarize for each row, unsafe times:\n\ny=1: always safe\n\ny=2: always safe (same as y=1)\n\ny=3: unsafe at τ=3\n\ny=4: unsafe at τ=3\n\ny=5: unsafe at τ=3\n\ny=6: unsafe at τ=8 and 9\n\ny=7: unsafe at τ=8 and 9\n\ny=8: unsafe at τ=8 and 9\n\nNow, I start at τ=0, y=1.\n\nI need to reach y=9 by some τ, say at τ = H-1, with y_{H-1} =9.\n\nThe position changes only when I move up or down.\n\nTo minimize H, I should move up as much as possible, but avoid being on a row when it is unsafe.\n\nIn the straight up path: τ=0,y=1; τ=1,y=2; τ=2,y=3; τ=3,y=4; but at τ=3, if y=4, unsafe, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I were on y=3 at τ=3, also unsafe.\n\nIn the path, at τ=2, y=3, which is safe? At τ=2, y=3 is freeway 3, which is unsafe only at τ=3, so at τ=2 it is safe.\n\nBut at τ=3, if I go to y=4, which is unsafe.\n\nI could stay on y=2 or y=3 at τ=3 to avoid y=4.\n\nBut y=3 at τ=3 is also unsafe.\n\nLet's see the options.\n\nI need to be on each row from 1 to 8 at some time, but I can skip rows if I move multiple, but no, I can only change by one per turn, so I must visit each y from 1 to 8 at some point, and y=9 at the end.\n\nNot necessarily visit all, but since I start at 1 and end at 9, and move by 1, I must pass through each integer y from 1 to 8 at least once, but I might stay on a row multiple times.\n\nThe sequence of y positions must include 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, and end at 9.\n\nI need to assign times to be on each row when it is safe.\n\nFor rows with unsafe times, I need to avoid those times.\n\nSpecifically:\n\ny=1: safe all τ\n\ny=2: safe all τ\n\ny=3: unsafe at τ=3 only, so safe for τ ≠3\n\ny=4: unsafe at τ=3 only, safe otherwise\n\ny=5: same, unsafe only τ=3\n\ny=6: unsafe at τ=8 and 9, safe otherwise\n\ny=7: unsafe at τ=8 and 9, safe otherwise\n\ny=8: unsafe at τ=8 and 9, safe otherwise\n\nNow, I start at τ=0 on y=1.\n\nI need to be on y=8 at some time before going to y=9.\n\nSince y=6,7,8 are unsafe at τ=8,9, I need to be on them before τ=8 or after τ=9.\n\nτ=9 is after, but I need to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nSimilarly for y=3,4,5, unsafe at τ=3.\n\nNow, minimal H=8 would require being on each row from 1 to 8 exactly once at τ=0 to 7, and y=9 at τ=8.\n\nBut at τ=3, I would be on y=4 (if τ=0,y1; τ=1,y2; τ=2,y3; τ=3,y4), but y=4 unsafe at τ=3.\n\nSimilarly, if I were on y=3 or y=5 at τ=3, also unsafe.\n\nIn the sequence, at τ=3, whatever row I am on between 3,4,5 is unsafe.\n\nBut I could be on a different row at τ=3.\n\nFor example, if I stay on y=2 at τ=3.\n\nBut y=2 is safe always.\n\nLet's list the required times.\n\nI need to visit y=3,4,5 at times not τ=3.\n\nSimilarly, y=6,7,8 at times not τ=8 or 9.\n\nNow, the earliest I can be on y=3 is τ=2, since from y=1 at τ=0, to y=2 at τ=1, to y=3 at τ=2.\n\nSimilarly, latest to be on y=8 is, well, I can delay.\n\nBut for minimal H, I want to go fast.\n\nSince y=3,4,5 are only unsafe at τ=3, and τ=3 is early, I can be on them before or after τ=3.\n\nBefore: at τ=2, I can be on y=3.\n\nAt τ=1, y=2 or less, but y=2 is below.\n\nAfter τ=3, e.g., τ=4 or later.\n\nSimilarly for y=6,7,8, unsafe at τ=8,9, so I need to be on them at τ<=7 or τ>=10.\n\nτ>=10 might be late.\n\nNow, for minimal H, let's see if H=8 is possible.\n\nWith H=8, I must be on y=8 at τ=7, since at τ=7, y=8; then τ=8, y=9.\n\nNow, at τ=7, y=8: is it safe? y=8 unsafe at τ=8,9, but at τ=7, it should be safe, since unsafe only τ=8,9.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at τ=6, etc.\n\nBut the problem is y=3,4,5 at τ=3.\n\nIn H=8, the times are fixed: τ=0,y1; τ=1,y2; τ=2,y3; τ=3,y4; τ=4,y5; τ=5,y6; τ=6,y7; τ=7,y8; τ=8,y9.\n\nAt τ=3, y=4, unsafe.\n\nAt τ=3, if I could be on y=3 or y=5, but y=3 and y=5 are also unsafe at τ=3.\n\nIn this sequence, at τ=2, y=3; τ=3, y=4; both y=3 and y=4 are unsafe at τ=3? y=3 is unsafe only if on it at τ=3, but at τ=2, I am on y=3, but the collision is checked at each time for the row at that time.\n\nAt τ=2, I am on y=3, and at τ=2, y=3 is safe, as we saw earlier.\n\nAt τ=3, I am on y=4, and at τ=3, y=4 is unsafe.\n\nThe issue is at τ=3, on y=4, unsafe.\n\nTo avoid, I need not to be on y=4 at τ=3.\n\nSimilarly, not on y=3 or y=5 at τ=3.\n\nIn the sequence, I need to skip τ=3 for rows 3,4,5.\n\nThat means at τ=3, I should be on a different row, like y=1,2,6,7,8, but y=6,7,8 at τ=3 might be possible, but I am at y=2 at τ=1, y=3 at τ=2, then to go to y=6 at τ=3, I need to move up 3 steps in one turn, impossible, I can only change by one.\n\nSo at τ=3, I can only be on y=2, y=3, or y=4, depending on previous action.\n\nFrom τ=2, y=3, I can go to y=2 (down), y=3 (stay), or y=4 (up).\n\nBut at τ=3:\n\n- If on y=2, safe\n\n- If on y=3, unsafe\n\n- If on y=4, unsafe\n\nSo only safe option at τ=3 is to be on y=2.\n\nThat means at τ=2, I need to move down to y=2 or stay on y=3 but staying is unsafe, so I must move down to y=2 at τ=3.\n\nThen at τ=3, I am on y=2, safe.\n\nThen from there, I need to go up to y=9.\n\nBut now I have lost time, so H will be more than 8.\n\nI could stay earlier.\n\nFor example, at τ=1, I am on y=2, I could stay on y=2 at τ=2, instead of going to y=3.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=2, safe.\n\nThen at τ=3, I can go to y=3 or y=2 or y=4? From y=2, actions to y=1,2,3.\n\nBut y=3 at τ=3 is unsafe, y=4 not possible directly.\n\nSo at τ=3, if I go to y=3, unsafe; stay on y=2, safe; or down to y=1.\n\nBut y=1 is safe, but moving down wastes time.\n\nSo best to stay on y=2 at τ=3.\n\nThen later go up.\n\nBut I need to visit y=3,4,5 at safe times.\n\ny=3,4,5 are safe except at τ=3.\n\nSo I can be on them at τ=2, or τ=4, etc.\n\nSimilarly for y=6,7,8, safe except τ=8,9.\n\nNow, let's plan a path with minimal delay.\n\nStart: τ=0, y=1, must take action to go to y=2 or stay or down, but up is better.\n\nAction at τ=0: U, so at τ=1, y=2.\n\nAt τ=1, on y=2, safe. Action: I can go to y=3 or stay or down.\n\nIf I go U to y=3 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, on y=3, which is safe since τ=2 ≠3.\n\nNow at τ=2, I need to choose action for τ=3.\n\nIf I go U to y=4 at τ=3, but y=4 unsafe at τ=3.\n\nIf I stay on y=3, unsafe at τ=3.\n\nIf I go D to y=2, then at τ=3, on y=2, safe.\n\nSo I should go D to y=2 at τ=3.\n\nAction at τ=2: D.\n\nThen at τ=3, y=2, safe.\n\nNow from here, I need to go up to y=3,4,5, but I need to be on them when safe.\n\ny=3 can be at τ=4, for example.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nAt τ=3, y=2, action: U to y=3 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, on y=3.\n\nIs y=3 safe at τ=4? Yes, since unsafe only at τ=3.\n\nSimilarly, I can go to y=4 at τ=5, y=5 at τ=6, etc.\n\nBut let's see y=6,7,8 unsafe at τ=8,9.\n\nIf I go straight: from τ=4,y=3; τ=5,y=4; τ=6,y=5; τ=7,y=6; τ=8,y=7; τ=9,y=8; then to y=9 at τ=10.\n\nBut at τ=8, y=7, and y=7 unsafe at τ=8? y=7 unsafe at τ=8 and τ=9.\n\nAt τ=8, if on y=7, unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=9, if on y=8, unsafe.\n\nIn this path: after τ=3,y=2; τ=4,y=3; τ=5,y=4; τ=6,y=5; all safe so far.\n\nτ=6,y=5: y=5 safe at τ=6, since unsafe only τ=3.\n\nThen τ=7,y=6: now y=6 at τ=7, is it safe? y=6 unsafe at τ=8,9, but τ=7<8, so should be safe? We need to check.\n\nAt τ=7, for freeway 6: car span [-59 +6*7, -48 +6*7] = [-59+42, -48+42] = [-17,-6], all neg, 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen at τ=7, action U to y=7 at τ=8.\n\nAt τ=8, on y=7: unsafe, since y=7 unsafe at τ=8.\n\nCollision.\n\nIf at τ=7, I stay on y=6, but at τ=8, if on y=6, y=6 unsafe at τ=8.\n\nIf I go to y=7 at τ=8, unsafe.\n\nProblem at τ=8 and τ=9 for y=6,7,8.\n\nIn the above, at τ=7, y=6 safe.\n\nBut then at τ=8, I need to be on some row.\n\nIf I go to y=7, unsafe.\n\nStay on y=6, unsafe at τ=8.\n\nGo down to y=5, but then I have to come back.\n\nNot good.\n\nTo avoid τ=8 and 9 on rows 6,7,8, I need to be on them before τ=8 or after τ=9.\n\nAfter τ=9 might be late.\n\nFor example, be on y=6 at τ=7, which is safe, as above.\n\nThen at τ=8, I could go to y=5 or stay or y=7, but all problematic.\n\ny=5 at τ=8: is y=5 safe at τ=8? y=5 unsafe only at τ=3, so at τ=8, should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=4, etc.\n\nBut if I go down, I waste moves.\n\nI could delay going to y=6.\n\nAnother idea: since y=3,4,5 are safe after τ=3, I can stay on lower rows longer to arrive at higher rows later, after τ=9.\n\nFor example, start by going up to y=2, then stay on y=2 for a few turns until it's time to go up when safe.\n\nBut I need to pass through the unsafe zone.\n\nList the sequence with actions.\n\nI need to be on y=3,4,5 at times not 3.\n\nPossible times: for y=3, at τ=2, or τ=4,5,... but τ=2 is early.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 at τ=2? But at τ=2, I can be on y=3, not y=4 directly.\n\nThe times I can be on each row depend on the path.\n\nSince I have to go from 1 to 2 to 3 etc., I can control the time by staying.\n\nFor rows 3,4,5, I need to be on them at τ ≤2 or τ≥4.\n\nBut τ=0,1 I am on y=1 or 2, so for y=3, I can be at τ=2 or τ≥4.\n\nSimilarly y=4 at τ=3? But τ=3 unsafe, so not at τ=3, so at τ=2? Can I be on y=4 at τ=2? From y=1 at τ=0, to y=2 at τ=1, to y=3 at τ=2, cannot be on y=4 at τ=2. Earliest y=4 is τ=3, but unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, latest, but I can be later.\n\nSo for y=4, I cannot be at τ=2, only at τ=3 or later, but τ=3 unsafe, so I must be on y=4 at τ≥4.\n\nSimilarly for y=5, at τ=4 or later, but τ=4 is possible.\n\ny=5 at τ=4: from y=4 at τ=3, but τ=3 unsafe, so if I am on y=4 at τ=3, collision, so I cannot be on y=4 at τ=3.\n\nTherefore, the earliest I can be on y=4 is τ=4.\n\nSimilarly, for y=3, I can be at τ=2 or τ≥4.\n\nFor y=5, at τ=4 or later.\n\nNow for rows 6,7,8, I need to be on them at τ≤7 or τ≥10.\n\nτ≤7 is early, τ≥10 late.\n\nFor minimal H, I want to be on them early if possible.\n\nBut τ=7 is before 8, so possible.\n\nFor example, be on y=6 at τ=7, y=7 at τ=8? But τ=8 unsafe for y=7.\n\nCannot be on y=7 at τ=8.\n\nEarliest y=7: from y=6 at τ=6, to y=7 at τ=7? y=7 at τ=7.\n\nIs τ=7 safe for y=7? y=7 unsafe at τ=8,9, so at τ=7, should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at τ=8 unsafe, but at τ=7 if I can.\n\nBut to be on y=8, I need to be on y=7 first.\n\nLet's construct a path.\n\nStart: τ=0, y=1, action U, to y=2 at τ=1.\n\nτ=1, y=2, action: I can go to y=3 at τ=2.\n\nτ=2, y=3, safe (τ=2≠3).\n\nNow at τ=2, instead of going up, I go down to y=2 for τ=3.\n\nAction at τ=2: D, so at τ=3, y=2, safe.\n\nτ=3, y=2, action: U to y=3 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, y=3, safe (τ=4>3).\n\nThen from here, I can go up: action U to y=4 at τ=5.\n\nAt τ=5, y=4, safe (τ=5≠3).\n\nAction U to y=5 at τ=6.\n\nAt τ=6, y=5, safe.\n\nNow, at τ=6, y=5, I need to go to y=6.\n\nBut y=6 at τ=6: is it safe? Freeway 6 at τ=6: span [-59 +6*6, -48+6*6] = [-59+36, -48+36] = [-23,-12], all neg, 0 not in, safe.\n\nSo action U to y=6 at τ=7.\n\nAt τ=7, y=6, safe (since τ=7<8).\n\nNow at τ=7, y=6, action: if I go U to y=7 at τ=8.\n\nBut at τ=8, y=7, unsafe.\n\nIf I stay on y=6, at τ=8, y=6, unsafe.\n\nIf I go down to y=5, then at τ=8, y=5, safe, but then I have to go back up.\n\nNot efficient.\n\nSo I need to be on y=7 at a safe time.\n\ny=7 safe for τ≤7 or τ≥10.\n\nAt τ=7, I can be on y=6 or y=7? At τ=7, from y=6, I can go to y=7 at τ=8, but τ=8 is unsafe for y=7.\n\nCannot be on y=7 at τ=7 directly? To be on y=7 at τ=7, I need to be on y=6 at τ=6, then U to y=7 at τ=7.\n\nIn the current path, at τ=6, I am on y=5, then U to y=6 at τ=7.\n\nSo at τ=7, on y=6.\n\nTo be on y=7 at τ=7, I would need to be on y=6 at τ=6.\n\nBut at τ=6, I am on y=5.\n\nSo I need to be on y=6 earlier.\n\nSimilarly, for y=7 at τ=7.\n\nBut y=6 at τ=6: safe? At τ=6, freeway 6: span [-59+36, -48+36] = [-23,-12], safe, as above.\n\nSo let's adjust the path.\n\nI need to reach y=6 earlier.\n\nFrom the beginning.\n\nAt τ=0, y=1, U to y=2 at τ=1.\n\nτ=1, y=2, U to y=3 at τ=2.\n\nτ=2, y=3, instead of going down, I go U to y=4? But at τ=3, if I go to y=4, unsafe.\n\nAt τ=2, y=3, I can only go to y=2,3,4.\n\nBut going to y=4 at τ=3 unsafe.\n\nSo I must go down or stay, but stay unsafe at τ=3.\n\nSo only go down to y=2 at τ=3.\n\nBut that delays.\n\nTo be on higher rows earlier, but I can't because of the unsafe at τ=3.\n\nAnother idea: at τ=1, y=2, instead of going to y=3, I stay on y=2 at τ=2.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=2, safe.\n\nThen at τ=2, action: I can go to y=3 at τ=3, but y=3 unsafe at τ=3.\n\nOr stay on y=2 at τ=3, safe.\n\nOr down to y=1.\n\nSo best to stay on y=2 at τ=3.\n\nThen at τ=3, y=2, action U to y=3 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, y=3, safe.\n\nThen U to y=4 at τ=5, safe.\n\nU to y=5 at τ=6, safe.\n\nNow at τ=6, y=5, I want to go to y=6.\n\nU to y=6 at τ=7, safe as before.\n\nNow at τ=7, y=6, I need to go to y=7.\n\nBut if U to y=7 at τ=8, unsafe.\n\nIf I stay, at τ=8, y=6 unsafe.\n\nSo I must not be on y=6,7,8 at τ=8 or 9.\n\nTherefore, at τ=7, I should go down to y=5 or something.\n\nFor example, at τ=7, y=6, action D to y=5 at τ=8.\n\nAt τ=8, y=5, safe (y=5 only unsafe at τ=3).\n\nThen at τ=8, y=5, action U to y=6 at τ=9.\n\nAt τ=9, y=6: but y=6 unsafe at τ=9? At τ=9, freeway 6: span [-59+54, -48+54] = [-5,6], 0 in, unsafe.\n\nCollision.\n\nIf I go to y=6 at τ=9, unsafe.\n\nIf at τ=8, from y=5, I go U to y=6 at τ=9, unsafe.\n\nOr I can stay on y=5 at τ=9, but y=5 safe, but not progressing.\n\nThen at τ=9, y=5, action U to y=6 at τ=10.\n\nAt τ=10, y=6: now τ=10, freeway 6 span [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12], all pos, 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen U to y=7 at τ=11, etc.\n\nBut this takes many turns.\n\nH will be large.\n\nTo reach y=9 at τ=10 or later.\n\nBut we want minimal H.\n\nSince y=6,7,8 are safe at τ=7, I can be on them at τ=7 if possible.\n\nFor example, be on y=6 at τ=7, y=7 at τ=7? No, at same time not possible.\n\nBe on y=7 at τ=7, y=8 at τ=8? But τ=8 unsafe for y=8.\n\ny=8 at τ=7: how?\n\nTo be on y=8 at τ=7, I need to be on y=7 at τ=6, then U to y=8 at τ=7.\n\nSimilarly, to be on y=7 at τ=7, need on y=6 at τ=6.\n\nSo let's see if I can be on y=6 at τ=6.\n\ny=6 at τ=6 safe, as before.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 at τ=7 safe, y=8 at τ=7? At τ=7, y=8.\n\ny=8 at τ=7: freeway 8, at τ=7.\n\nFirst car span [-59 +6*7, -48+6*7] = [-59+42, -48+42] = [-17,-6], all neg, 0 not in.\n\nSecond car [7+42,18+42]= [49,60], all pos, so safe.\n\nSo y=8 at τ=7 safe.\n\nThen from y=8, U to y=9 at τ=8.\n\nAt τ=8, y=9, safe, no cars.\n\nBut to be on y=8 at τ=7, I need to be on y=7 at τ=6.\n\ny=7 at τ=6: freeway 7, car span [-59+36, -48+36] = [-23,-12], safe.\n\nSimilarly, to be on y=7 at τ=6, need on y=6 at τ=5 or something.\n\nLet's trace back.\n\nI need to be on y=6 at τ=5? Or earlier.\n\nStart: τ=0, y=1, U to y=2 at τ=1.\n\nτ=1, y=2, U to y=3 at τ=2.\n\nNow at τ=2, y=3, I need to go up fast to reach y=6 by τ=5 or 6.\n\nBut I have to pass y=4 and y=5.\n\nAt τ=2, y=3, if I U to y=4 at τ=3, but τ=3 unsafe for y=4.\n\nNot possible.\n\nAt τ=2, I must not go to y=4 at τ=3, so I must go down or stay, but both lead to delay at τ=3.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=4 before τ=4.\n\nEarliest y=4 is τ=4.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 at τ=5, y=6 at τ=6, etc.\n\nSo y=6 at τ=6 is earliest possible.\n\nThen y=7 at τ=7, y=8 at τ=8.\n\nBut y=8 at τ=8 is unsafe.\n\ny=7 at τ=7 safe, but to go to y=8 at τ=8 unsafe.\n\nIf I could be on y=8 at τ=7, but to be on y=8 at τ=7, I need to be on y=7 at τ=6, which requires on y=6 at τ=5.\n\nBut y=6 at τ=5: possible? From y=5 at τ=4, U to y=6 at τ=5.\n\ny=5 at τ=4: how?\n\ny=4 at τ=4, U to y=5 at τ=5, etc.\n\nBut y=4 at τ=4 is possible.\n\nLet's list the sequence with times.\n\nI need to be on y=4 at τ=4 or later.\n\nSet τ=4, y=4.\n\nThen τ=5, y=5; τ=6, y=6; τ=7, y=7; τ=8, y=8; but y=8 at τ=8 unsafe.\n\nAt τ=7, y=7, if I U to y=8 at τ=8, unsafe.\n\nStay on y=7 at τ=8, unsafe.\n\nSo I need to be on y=7 at τ=7, but not go to y=8 at τ=8.\n\nInstead, at τ=7, go down to y=6 or something, but then delay.\n\nOr, be on y=8 at τ=7.\n\nTo be on y=8 at τ=7, I need to be on y=7 at τ=6.\n\nTo be on y=7 at τ=6, need on y=6 at τ=5.\n\nTo be on y=6 at τ=5, need on y=5 at τ=4.\n\nTo be on y=5 at τ=4, need on y=4 at τ=3.\n\nBut y=4 at τ=3 unsafe, impossible.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be on y=8 at τ=7.\n\nThe earliest I can be on y=8 is τ=8, but unsafe, or τ=9 unsafe, or τ=10.\n\nSimilarly for y=7, earliest τ=7, but then at τ=8 I have to move, but moving to y=8 at τ=8 unsafe.\n\nSo the only way is to be on y=7 at τ=7, then at τ=7 action S or D to avoid being on y=7 or y=8 at τ=8.\n\nFor example, at τ=7, y=7, action D to y=6 at τ=8.\n\nThen at τ=8, on y=6, but y=6 unsafe at τ=8, collision.\n\nIf action S, on y=7 at τ=8, unsafe.\n\nIf action U to y=8, unsafe.\n\nNo good.\n\nAction D to y=6 at τ=8, but y=6 unsafe.\n\nSo all options at τ=8 on y=6,7,8 are unsafe.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be on rows 6,7,8 at τ=8 or 9.\n\nI must be on them at τ≤7 or τ≥10.\n\nτ≤7: I can be on y=6 at τ=7, as before.\n\ny=7 at τ=7, possible if I reach earlier.\n\ny=7 at τ=7: to be on y=7 at τ=7, need on y=6 at τ=6.\n\ny=6 at τ=6, need on y=5 at τ=5.\n\ny=5 at τ=5, need on y=4 at τ=4.\n\ny=4 at τ=4, need on y=3 at τ=3, but y=3 unsafe at τ=3.\n\nCannot be on y=3 at τ=3.\n\ny=4 at τ=4 requires on y=3 at τ=3 or earlier, but earliest y=3 is τ=2, then at τ=3 I can be on y=4 only if I go U from y=3 at τ=3, but y=4 unsafe at τ=3.\n\nOr from y=3 at τ=2, I can stay on y=3 at τ=3, unsafe.\n\nOr go down.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=4 before τ=4.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 at τ=5, y=6 at τ=6, y=7 at τ=7.\n\nThen at τ=7, y=7, safe.\n\nBut then I am stuck because at τ=8, wherever I go on rows 6-8, it's unsafe.\n\nSo I need to be on a lower row at τ=8, like y=5 or below.\n\nFor example, at τ=7, y=7, action D to y=6 at τ=8, but y=6 unsafe at τ=8.\n\nNot possible.\n\nAction D to y=6 at τ=8, collision.\n\nSo the only way is to not be on rows 6-8 at τ=8 and τ=9.\n\nThat means at τ=8 and τ=9, I must be on y=5 or below, or y=9, but y=9 not yet.\n\ny=0 to 5 or 9.\n\nBut y=5 at τ=8 is safe, as we saw.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo let's plan to be on y=5 at τ=8.\n\nThen from there go up after τ=9.\n\nFor example, in the path:\n\nAt τ=6, y=5 (as before), safe.\n\nThen at τ=6, action S to stay on y=5 at τ=7? Or U to y=6 at τ=7.\n\nBut if I go to y=6 at τ=7, then at τ=7, y=6, safe, but then at τ=8, I need to go down to avoid.\n\nBut going down to y=5 at τ=8.\n\nAt τ=8, y=5, safe.\n\nThen at τ=8, on y=5, action U to y=6 at τ=9.\n\nBut at τ=9, y=6, unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt τ=8, y=5, action S to stay on y=5 at τ=9.\n\nAt τ=9, y=5, safe.\n\nThen at τ=9, action U to y=6 at τ=10.\n\nAt τ=10, y=6, safe as before.\n\nThen U to y=7 at τ=11, U to y=8 at τ=12, U to y=9 at τ=13.\n\nH-1 = 13, so H=14 turns, large.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nSince I can be on y=6 at τ=7, and it is safe, but I have to leave before τ=8.\n\nBut at τ=7, I can go down to y=5 at τ=8, but y=5 at τ=8 is safe, as above.\n\nBut then at τ=8, I am on y=5, not on 6,7,8, so safe.\n\nThen at τ=8, I can go to y=6 at τ=9, but unsafe.\n\nSo I have to wait until τ=10 to go to y=6.\n\nBut that means I spend extra turns on lower rows.\n\nTo minimize H, I should reach the lower rows later so that I can go through 6,7,8 after τ=9.\n\nFor example, delay the ascent.\n\nStart at τ=0, y=1.\n\nInstead of going up immediately, I can stay or down, but down to y=0 wastes, so stay.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nAt τ=0, y=1, action S, stay on y=1 at τ=1.\n\nBut y=1 safe, but not progress.\n\nWorse.\n\nSo better to go up to y=2 quickly.\n\nThen stay on y=2 for a few turns until I can go up safely after τ=3.\n\nFor example:\n\nτ=0, y=1, action U, to y=2 at τ=1.\n\nτ=1, y=2, action S, stay on y=2 at τ=2.\n\nτ=2, y=2, action S, stay on y=2 at τ=3. (since at τ=3, on y=2 safe)\n\nτ=3, y=2, action U, to y=3 at τ=4.\n\nτ=4, y=3, action U, to y=4 at τ=5.\n\nτ=5, y=4, action U, to y=5 at τ=6.\n\nτ=6, y=5, action U, to y=6 at τ=7.\n\nτ=7, y=6, action U, to y=7 at τ=8? But at τ=8, y=7 unsafe.\n\nSo instead, at τ=7, y=6, action D to y=5 at τ=8. (to avoid being on 6-8)\n\nAt τ=8, y=5, safe.\n\nThen at τ=8, y=5, action S, stay on y=5 at τ=9. (since at τ=9, y=5 safe)\n\nτ=9, y=5, action U, to y=6 at τ=10.\n\nAt τ=10, y=6, safe (span [1,12] as before)\n\nAction U to y=7 at τ=11.\n\nAt τ=11, y=7: freeway 7 at τ=11, span [-59+66, -48+66] = [7,18], all pos, 0 not in, safe.\n\nAction U to y=8 at τ=12.\n\nAt τ=12, y=8: freeway 8 at τ=12, first car span [-59+72, -48+72] = [13,24], second car [7+72,18+72]= [79,90], all pos, safe.\n\nAction U to y=9 at τ=13.\n\nSo I reach y=9 at τ=13, so H-1=13, H=14.\n\nBut this is with many stays.\n\nI can reduce by not staying on y=2 so long.\n\nIn the above, I stayed on y=2 from τ=1 to τ=3, three turns on y=2.\n\nBut I only need to avoid being on y=3,4,5 at τ=3, so I can be on y=3 at τ=2, then go down to y=2 at τ=3, then continue.\n\nFor example:\n\nτ=0, y=1, action U, to y=2 at τ=1.\n\nτ=1, y=2, action U, to y=3 at τ=2.\n\nτ=2, y=3, action D, to y=2 at τ=3. (avoid unsafe)\n\nτ=3, y=2, action U, to y=3 at τ=4.\n\nτ=4, y=3, action U, to y=4 at τ=5.\n\nτ=5, y=4, action U, to y=5 at τ=6.\n\nτ=6, y=5, action U, to y=6 at τ=7.\n\nNow at τ=7, y=6, instead of going down, I can go to y=7 at τ=8, but unsafe, or down.\n\nBut let's go down to y=5 at τ=8.\n\nτ=7, action D, to y=5 at τ=8.\n\nAt τ=8, y=5, safe.\n\nThen at τ=8, action U to y=6 at τ=9, but at τ=9, y=6 unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nAction S to stay on y=5 at τ=9.\n\nAt τ=9, y=5, action U to y=6 at τ=10.\n\nThen as before, to y=7 at τ=11, y=8 at τ=12, y=9 at τ=13.\n\nSame as before, H-1=13.\n\nBut in this case, I have one extra down move.\n\nIn the first sequence, I had stays, here I have a down move, similar number of turns.\n\nTo reach y=9 at τ=13, H-1=13, so the turn index: from τ=0 to τ=13, 14 steps, but H is the number of actions from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nAt time τ, after τ actions from τ=0.\n\nAt τ=0, initial position, no action yet.\n\nAfter action at τ=0, position at τ=1, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, position at τ=H.\n\nI need position at τ=H to be y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, after H actions, at time τ=H, y_H =9.\n\nFor example, in the straight line, after 8 actions, at τ=8, y=9.\n\nIn my path, after actions at τ=0 to 12, position at τ=13 is y=9.\n\nSo 13 actions, H=13.\n\nτ from 0 to 12, 13 steps.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t1 to t1+H-1, so actions from t1 to t1+H-1, position at t1+H-1.\n\nWith τ = t - t1, so at τ=0, position given.\n\nAfter k actions, at τ=k.\n\nPosition at τ=k after k actions.\n\nI need at some K, y_K =9, with K min.\n\nThen H = K+1, since at turn t1, I take action for position at t1+1, etc.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt turn t1 =9, I am at position (0,1).\n\nI choose action a_{t1} for the next position.\n\nAfter action at turn t, position at turn t+1.\n\nSo at turn t=9, I choose a9, then position at t=10 is y10 = y9 + Δy9.\n\nSimilarly, at turn t, position y_t.\n\nCollision at turn t if on row y_t, 0 in span at time t.\n\nFor turn T, time T.\n\nIn terms of τ, let τ = t - 9, so at τ=0, turn 9, position y=1.\n\nAfter action at τ=0, position at τ=1 (turn 10), and so on.\n\nAt time τ, position y_τ.\n\nI need y_τ =9 for some τ, min τ.\n\nThen the number of actions is τ, from τ=0 to τ-1.\n\nFor example, to reach at τ=8, I need 8 actions.\n\nIn my case, with τ=13, I need 13 actions.\n\nBut I think I can do with less by not going down but staying less.\n\nAnother idea: for the upper rows, since they are unsafe at τ=8,9, but I can be on them at τ=7 and then jump to y=9 or something, but I can only move one step.\n\nAt τ=7, I can be on y=7, then at τ=8, I can go to y=8, but unsafe, or to y=6, unsafe, etc.\n\nBut if I go to y=8 at τ=8, unsafe, so not possible.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, I can be on it at τ=10.\n\nBut let's calculate the minimal τ to reach y=9.\n\nI must increase y from 1 to 9, 8 steps up.\n\nEach U action increases y by 1, S or D no change or decrease.\n\nTo increase by 8, I need at least 8 U actions.\n\nThe number of S and D actions add to the total turns.\n\nMinimal turns is 8 with no S or D.\n\nBut not possible due to collisions.\n\nWith S or D, more turns.\n\nIn the path, I have to spend time on safe rows when unsafe times occur.\n\nFor the lower part, the unsafe time is τ=3 for y=3,4,5, so I need to be on them at other times.\n\nThe time lost is at least 1 turn for the lower part.\n\nFor the upper part, unsafe at τ=8,9, so I need to be on y=6,7,8 at τ<=7 or τ>=10.\n\nIf I can be on them at τ=7, then I can go to y=9 at τ=8, but to be on y=8 at τ=7, I need to be on y=7 at τ=6, etc., which requires being on y=4 at τ=3, impossible.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=8 at τ=7.\n\nThe best is to be on y=6 at τ=7, then I have to wait until τ=10 to go to y=6 again or something.\n\nFrom y=6 at τ=7, I go down to y=5 at τ=8, then stay on y=5 at τ=9, then to y=6 at τ=10, etc.\n\nThat costs 3 extra turns (τ=8 and τ=9 on y=5, and τ=10 to y=6, but I was at y=6 at τ=7, then down to y=5 at τ=8, so at τ=8 I am on y=5, then at τ=9 on y=5, then at τ=10 to y=6, so from τ=7 to τ=10, I moved from y=6 to y=6 in 3 turns, net no progress, so 3 wasted turns.\n\nSimilarly, for the lower part, in the first way, I had a delay of 1 or 2 turns.\n\nSo total min H around 11 or 12.\n\nLet's find a path with less waste.\n\nSuppose I stay on y=2 from τ=1 to τ=3, so at τ=1,2,3 on y=2.\n\nThen at τ=3, U to y=3 at τ=4.\n\nτ=4, U to y=4 at τ=5.\n\nτ=5, U to y=5 at τ=6.\n\nτ=6, U to y=6 at τ=7.\n\nAt τ=7, y=6, I can go U to y=7 at τ=8, unsafe, or D to y=5 at τ=8.\n\nBut at τ=8, if on y=5, safe.\n\nThen at τ=8, y=5, I can U to y=6 at τ=9, unsafe.\n\nSo S on y=5 at τ=9.\n\nThen U to y=6 at τ=10.\n\nU to y=7 at τ=11.\n\nU to y=8 at τ=12.\n\nU to y=9 at τ=13.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAt τ=7, y=6, I go S to stay on y=6 at τ=8, but unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=8 at τ=10.\n\nTo be on y=8 at τ=10, I need to be on y=7 at τ=9, but y=7 at τ=9 unsafe.\n\ny=7 at τ=10.\n\nLet's list the safe times for each row.\n\ny=3: safe τ=0,1,2,4,5,6,... except τ=3\n\nBut τ=0,1 I am on y=1 or 2, so possible τ=2,4,5,...\n\ny=4: safe all τ except 3, but earliest τ=4, so τ=4,5,6,...\n\ny=5: safe all except 3, so τ=4,5,6,... since τ=3 not possible.\n\ny=6: safe τ=0 to7,10,11,... except 8,9\n\nBut τ=0-7 possible, or later.\n\ny=7: same, safe τ=0-7,10,11,...\n\ny=8: safe τ=0-7,10,11,... except 8,9\n\nTo minimize, for y=6, I can be at τ=7.\n\nFor y=7, at τ=7, but if I am on y=7 at τ=7, I can go to y=8 at τ=8, unsafe, or stay, unsafe.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=7 at τ=7 if I want to go up, because next step will be at τ=8.\n\nBut if I am on y=7 at τ=7, and I go down to y=6 at τ=8, but y=6 unsafe at τ=8.\n\nSo the only safe way is to be on y=7 at a time when I can leave to y=8 at a safe time.\n\nFor example, be on y=7 at τ=10, then U to y=8 at τ=11, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut to be on y=7 at τ=10, I need to be on y=6 at τ=9, but y=6 at τ=9 unsafe.\n\nBe on y=6 at τ=10.\n\nSo let's set y=6 at τ=10.\n\nThen y=7 at τ=11, y=8 at τ=12, y=9 at τ=13.\n\nNow for the lower part, I can be on y=5 at τ=6, for example.\n\nThen from y=5 at τ=6 to y=6 at τ=10, I need to fill the time.\n\nFrom τ=6 to τ=10, 4 turns, I can stay on y=5 or move down and up, but not efficient.\n\nSince y=5 is safe at τ=6,7,8,9, I can stay on y=5 from τ=6 to τ=9, then to y=6 at τ=10.\n\nBut that means I stay on y=5 for 4 turns, which is waste.\n\nI can reach y=5 later.\n\nFor example, start later.\n\nAt τ=0, y=1, U to y=2 at τ=1.\n\nThen stay on y=2 from τ=1 to τ=4, for example.\n\nAt τ=1, y=2.\n\nAction S at τ=1, to y=2 at τ=2.\n\nAction S at τ=2, to y=2 at τ=3.\n\nAction S at τ=3, to y=2 at τ=4.\n\nThen at τ=4, U to y=3 at τ=5.\n\nAt τ=5, U to y=4 at τ=6.\n\nAt τ=6, U to y=5 at τ=7.\n\nAt τ=7, U to y=6 at τ=8, but at τ=8, y=6 unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt τ=7, on y=5, I can stay or down.\n\nBut to reach y=6 at τ=10, I can stay on y=5 from τ=7 to τ=9.\n\nAt τ=7, y=5, action S to y=5 at τ=8.\n\nAction S to y=5 at τ=9.\n\nAction U to y=6 at τ=10.\n\nThen U to y=7 at τ=11, U to y=8 at τ=12, U to y=9 at τ=13.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut in this case, I stayed on y=2 from τ=1 to τ=4, 4 turns, and on y=5 from τ=7 to τ=9, 3 turns, total many turns.\n\nFrom the beginning, I can go up to y=3 at τ=2, down to y=2 at τ=3, then U to y=3 at τ=4, U to y=4 at τ=5, U to y=5 at τ=6, then stay on y=5 until τ=9, then to y=6 at τ=10, etc.\n\nThen the sequence:\n\nτ=0: y=1, action U\n\nτ=1: y=2, action U\n\nτ=2: y=3, action D  (to avoid unsafe at τ=3)\n\nτ=3: y=2, action U\n\nτ=4: y=3, action U\n\nτ=5: y=4, action U\n\nτ=6: y=5, action S  (stay for later)\n\nτ=7: y=5, action S\n\nτ=8: y=5, action S\n\nτ=9: y=5, action U\n\nτ=10: y=6, action U\n\nτ=11: y=7, action U\n\nτ=12: y=8, action U\n\nτ=13: y=9\n\nReached at τ=13, with 13 actions.\n\nH=13 for the number of actions, so at turn t1+H-1 =9+12=21, position y=9.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nActions from turn t1=9 to turn 9+12=21.\n\nPosition at turn 10 to 22? Let's list turns.\n\nAt turn 9: position y=1, choose action a9\n\nAfter a9, position at turn 10.\n\n etc.\n\nWith τ, at turn 9+τ, position y_τ.\n\nAfter action at turn 9+τ for τ=0 to 12, position at turn 10+τ.\n\nAt turn 10+τ for τ=0 to 12, position from y1 to y13.\n\nAt turn 10, position y1, turn 11, y2, ..., turn 22, y13=9.\n\nTurn when position is 9 is turn 22.\n\nTurn t1+H-1 =9+13-1=21, position at turn 21.\n\nIn the sequence, after H actions, position at turn t1+H.\n\nFor example, after 0 actions, turn t1, position given.\n\nAfter 1 action, turn t1+1, position new.\n\nI need position at some turn T to be 9, with T min.\n\nThen H = T - t1.\n\nSince from turn t1 to turn T, there are T - t1 actions.\n\nAt turn t1, position given.\n\nAfter first action at turn t1, position at turn t1+1.\n\nAfter second action at turn t1+1, position at turn t1+2, and so on.\n\nAfter k-th action at turn t1+k-1, position at turn t1+k.\n\nI need position at turn t1+k =9 for some k min.\n\nThen H = k, the number of actions.\n\nTurn at position 9 is t1+k.\n\nIn terms of τ, at time τ, turn t1+τ, position y_τ.\n\ny_τ at turn t1+τ.\n\nI need y_K =9 at turn t1+K for some K min.\n\nThen H = K, number of actions from turn t1 to t1+K-1.\n\nFor K=8, turn t1+8=17, position y8=9.\n\nBut not possible.\n\nIn my path, K=13, turn 9+13=22, position y13=9.\n\nH=13.\n\nBut I think I can do with K=10 or 11.\n\nLet's see the car on freeway 3,4,5 unsafe only at τ=3, so I can be on y=4 at τ=4, which is only 1 turn delay.\n\nSimilarly for upper, the unsafe window is τ=8,9, so I need to be on y=6,7,8 at τ=7 or τ=10.\n\nIf at τ=7, y=6, then I have to wait until τ=10 to go to y=6 again, so 3 turns waste.\n\nIf I can be on y=7 at τ=7, same thing.\n\nOr, I can be on y=8 at τ=10.\n\nBut to be on y=8 at τ=10, I need to be on y=7 at τ=9, but y=7 at τ=9 unsafe.\n\nBe on y=7 at τ=10.\n\nSo y=7 at τ=10 requires on y=6 at τ=9, unsafe.\n\nSo must be on y=6 at τ=10.\n\nThen the waste is from when I am at y=5 or below to when I reach y=6 at τ=10.\n\nIf I am at y=5 at τ=6, I can stay until τ=9, then to y=6 at τ=10, so 4 turns on y=5.\n\nIf I am at y=5 at τ=7, stay until τ=9, to y=6 at τ=10, 3 turns on y=5.\n\nSimilarly, if I reach y=5 later, less stay, but later arrival.\n\nFor example, if I am on y=5 at τ=7, then I can stay at τ=7,8,9 on y=5, then to y=6 at τ=10.\n\nBut how to be on y=5 at τ=7.\n\nFrom start, minimal time to y=5 is with some delay.\n\nFor example: start τ=0, y=1, U to y=2 at τ=1.\n\nτ=1, y=2, U to y=3 at τ=2.\n\nτ=2, y=3, D to y=2 at τ=3.\n\nτ=3, y=2, U to y=3 at τ=4.\n\nτ=4, y=3, U to y=4 at τ=5.\n\nτ=5, y=4, U to y=5 at τ=6.  -- y=5 at τ=6\n\nThen at τ=6, y=5, I can U to y=6 at τ=7.\n\nThen at τ=7, y=6, then I need to go down or stay, but both unsafe at next step, so instead, at τ=6, y=5, I do not go to y=6, but stay on y=5.\n\nSo action S at τ=6, to y=5 at τ=7.\n\nThen S at τ=7, to y=5 at τ=8.\n\nS at τ=8, to y=5 at τ=9.\n\nU at τ=9, to y=6 at τ=10.\n\nU to y=7 at τ=11.\n\nU to y=8 at τ=12.\n\nU to y=9 at τ=13.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAt τ=6, y=5, if I go U to y=6 at τ=7, then at τ=7, y=6, I can go D to y=5 at τ=8.\n\nThen at τ=8, y=5, S to y=5 at τ=9.\n\nU to y=6 at τ=10, etc., but same number.\n\nSo K=13 seems the best.\n\nBut let's check if I can reach y=5 later to reduce the stay.\n\nFor example, stay on y=2 longer.\n\nτ=0: y=1, U\n\nτ=1: y=2, S\n\nτ=2: y=2, S\n\nτ=3: y=2, U to y=3 at τ=4\n\nτ=4: y=3, U to y=4 at τ=5\n\nτ=5: y=4, U to y=5 at τ=6\n\nSame as above, y=5 at τ=6.\n\nIf I stay on y=2 at τ=4, then U to y=3 at τ=5, U to y=4 at τ=6, U to y=5 at τ=7.\n\nThen at τ=7, y=5, then I can stay on y=5 at τ=8,9, then U to y=6 at τ=10.\n\nThen U to y=7 at τ=11, U to y=8 at τ=12, U to y=9 at τ=13.\n\nStill K=13.\n\nFrom τ=7, y=5, to y=6 at τ=10, I need to be on y=5 for τ=7,8,9, three turns.\n\nThen to go to y=9, from y=6 to y=9, 3 turns, so from y=5 at τ=7 to y=9 at τ=13, 6 turns for 4 steps, waste 2 turns.\n\nBut unavoidable.\n\nSo minimal K=13, H=13.\n\nBut let's confirm with the car on freeway 8.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 8, the second car might help, but it doesn't cover 0.\n\nAnother thing: at τ=3 for y=4, it is unsafe, but if I move to y=4 at τ=3, but since I am on y=4 at turn T=9+3=12, and at that turn, 0 is occupied, so collision.\n\nNo way.\n\nSo I think H=13 is the minimal.\n\nNow for the sequence, let's list the actions.\n\nTurn t1=9.\n\nPosition at turn 9: (0,1)\n\nChoose action for turn 9.\n\nIn the sequence I have:\n\nAt τ=0 (turn 9), position y=1, action U (to y=2 at turn 10)\n\nThen at τ=1 (turn 10), position y=2, action U (to y=3 at turn 11)\n\nThen at τ=2 (turn 11), position y=3, action D (to y=2 at turn 12)\n\nThen at τ=3 (turn 12), position y=2, action U (to y=3 at turn 13)\n\nThen at τ=4 (turn 13), position y=3, action U (to y=4 at turn 14)\n\nThen at τ=5 (turn 14), position y=4, action U (to y=5 at turn 15)\n\nThen at τ=6 (turn 15), position y=5, action S (stay y=5 at turn 16)\n\nThen at τ=7 (turn 16), position y=5, action S (stay y=5 at turn 17)\n\nThen at τ=8 (turn 17), position y=5, action S (stay y=5 at turn 18)\n\nThen at τ=9 (turn 18), position y=5, action U (to y=6 at turn 19)\n\nThen at τ=10 (turn 19), position y=6, action U (to y=7 at turn 20)\n\nThen at τ=11 (turn 20), position y=7, action U (to y=8 at turn 21)\n\nThen at τ=12 (turn 21), position y=8, action U (to y=9 at turn 22)\n\nAt turn 22, position y=9.\n\nActions from turn 9 to turn 21, that's 13 actions.\n\nTurn 9 to turn 21 inclusive is 13 turns.\n\nTurn t1 to t1+H-1, with H=13, so turns 9 to 21, actions at those turns.\n\nPosition at turn 22 is after action at turn 21.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 21, action U, to position at turn 22, y=9.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut at τ=6,7,8 I stayed on y=5, which is safe.\n\nAnd at τ=10,11,12 on y=6,7,8, all safe.\n\nNow for the answer, I need to list the actions for each turn.\n\nBut in the sequence above, I have action at turn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: D\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: S\n\nTurn 17: S\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nThen position at turn 22: (0,9)\n\nBut turn 22 is not in the actions, the last action is at turn 21.\n\nH=13 turns from t1=9 to 21.\n\nIn the box, list actions from turn t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nSo for turn 9 to 21.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nPerhaps I can reduce by one turn.\n\nFor example, instead of staying on y=5, can I be on y=6 at τ=10 directly from earlier.\n\nBut I have to pass through the unsafe window.\n\nSuppose at τ=7, I am on y=6, then I go down to y=5 at τ=8, but at τ=8, y=5 is safe, then at τ=8, I can go to y=4 or something, but that might not help.\n\nAt τ=8, y=5, action D to y=4 at τ=9.\n\nAt τ=9, y=4, safe? y=4 safe at τ=9.\n\nThen at τ=9, action U to y=5 at τ=10.\n\nAt τ=10, y=5, then U to y=6 at τ=11, etc., worse.\n\nNot better.\n\nSo I think K=13 is minimal.\n\nSo for the answer, the sequence of actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have a down action at turn 11.\n\nNow to write in the format.\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1} for turn 9.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 9: U\n\nTurn 10: U\n\nTurn 11: D\n\nTurn 12: U\n\nTurn 13: U\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: S\n\nTurn 16: S\n\nTurn 17: S\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nAnd that's 13 actions.\n\nH=13.\n\nBut let's make sure about the collision at other points.\n\nFor example, at turn 12 (τ=3), position y=2, freeway 2, car span at τ=3: for freeway 2, left-moving, [ -60 -36*3, -25 -36*3] = [-60-108, -25-108] = [-168,-133], all neg, safe.\n\nAt turn 14 (τ=5), y=4, freeway 4 at τ=5, cars: first car span [-47+12*5, -36+12*5] = [-47+60, -36+60] = [13,24], all pos; second [37+60,48+60]=[97,108]; third [1+60,12+60]=[61,72], all pos, 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 18 (τ=9), y=5, freeway 5 at τ=9, cars same as above, spans even larger positive, safe.\n\nAt turn 19 (τ=10), y=6, freeway 6 span [-59+60, -48+60]=[1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nEtc.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nAnd minimal H seems 13.\n\nBut is there a way with H=12?\n\nSuppose I reach y=5 at τ=6, then instead of staying, I go to y=6 at τ=7, then at τ=7, go down to y=5 at τ=8, then at τ=8, go to y=6 at τ=9, but y=6 unsafe at τ=9, not possible.\n\nAt τ=8, y=5, go to y=6 at τ=9, unsafe.\n\nSo must wait until τ=10.\n\nThus, H=13 is minimal.\n\nSo the actions are as above.\n\nNow for the answer format.\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 9: U \\\\ Turn 10: U \\\\ Turn 11: D \\\\ Turn 12: U \\\\ Turn 13: U \\\\ Turn 14: U \\\\ Turn 15: S \\\\ Turn 16: S \\\\ Turn 17: S \\\\ Turn 18: U \\\\ Turn 19: U \\\\ Turn 20: U \\\\ Turn 21: U }\n\nIn the sequence, turn 15,16,17 are S, but perhaps I can have only two S if I adjust, but not necessary.\n\nSince y=5 is safe, I can stay.\n\nSo this should be fine.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 9\\) is 13. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by strategically moving up, down, or staying to avoid unsafe times.\n\n- Freeways \\(y = 3, 4, 5\\) are unsafe at \\(\\tau = 3\\) (turn 12) due to cars covering position \\(x = 0\\).\n- Freeways \\(y = 6, 7, 8\\) are unsafe at \\(\\tau = 8\\) and \\(\\tau = 9\\) (turns 17 and 18) due to cars covering position \\(x = 0\\).\n\nThe sequence ensures:\n- At \\(\\tau = 3\\) (turn 12), the player is on \\(y = 2\\), which is safe.\n- From \\(\\tau = 6\\) to \\(\\tau = 8\\) (turns 15 to 17), the player stays on \\(y = 5\\) to avoid being on \\(y = 6, 7, 8\\) during unsafe times \\(\\tau = 8\\) and \\(\\tau = 9\\).\n- The player moves to \\(y = 6\\) at \\(\\tau = 10\\) (turn 19), after the unsafe window.\n\nThe actions are chosen to minimize \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions, resulting in \\(H = 13\\) turns.\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 9: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 10: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 11: D \\\\ \\text{Turn } 12: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 13: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 14: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 15: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 16: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 17: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 18: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 19: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 21: U }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0, 0) at turn t1 = 12. I need to get to (0, 9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. Collision happens only if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that y, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. The player moves vertically, and the cars move horizontally on their freeways.\n\nThe player position updates based on actions: U for up (y+1), D for down (y-1), S for stay (y same). y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nCars are defined for each freeway k from 1 to 8. For each car, we have head h, tail τ, direction, and speed. Direction left means moving left (negative x), right means moving right (positive x). The span updates based on time.\n\nImportant point: collision is checked only when the player is on a freeway at a given turn. If the player moves to a new freeway at turn T, they are not considered on that new freeway until the next turn. From the note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nAlso, for the car update: for left-moving cars, span at T is [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)], and since it's moving left, h should be the right end, I think. Let me read carefully.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\"\n\nBut if it's moving left, and h and τ are given, for example, on freeway 1: (48, 83, left, 36). 48 to 83, but if it's left-moving, and head is 48, tail 83, that might imply tail is behind or something. Typically, for a car moving left, the head would be the front, so if moving left, head should be larger than tail if we think x decreasing.\n\nBut in the span, it says [h, τ] for left-moving at t1, and then [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] at T.\n\nIn this case, for freeway 1: h=48, τ=83, left. But 48 to 83, if x increasing to the right, 48 to 83 is from left to right, but moving left? That might be inconsistent.\n\nPerhaps the coordinates are such that for left-moving, head is the right end, tail is left end? But that seems odd.\n\nLet me look at the right-moving example.\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nFor right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h], which might mean from τ to h, with τ < h, so tail at τ, head at h, moving right.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, span at t1 is [h, τ], which might have h and τ such that h > τ if moving left, so head at h, tail at τ with h > τ.\n\nIn freeway 1: (48, 83, left, 36). If [h, τ] = [48,83], and moving left, so at t1, it's from 48 to 83, but if moving left, the head should be decreasing, so from higher x to lower x.\n\nBut 48 to 83, 48 < 83, so if x increases, 48 is left, 83 is right, so if moving left, it's going from right to left, so head might be 83, tail 48? But here it's given as (head, tail) = (48,83), which would be head=48, tail=83, but 48 < 83, so if head is front, for left-moving, front should be left if moving left? I'm confused.\n\nPerhaps \"head\" and \"tail\" are misnomers, or it's defined differently.\n\nFrom the update: for left-moving, span at T is [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]. Since it's moving left, both ends decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, both increase.\n\nThe collision condition is that for the player on freeway y at turn T, if for any car on that freeway, 0 is in the span at T, then collision.\n\n0 is the x-coordinate where the player is, since player is at (0,y) for some y.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to know when cars occupy x=0 at different turns.\n\nLet t1 = 12, current turn.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions from t=12 onwards to reach y=9 quickly without being on a freeway y when a car is at x=0 on that freeway at that turn.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (h=48, τ=83, d=left, s=36)\n\nSince left-moving, span at time T (relative to t1) is [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] = [48 - 36*(T-12), 83 - 36*(T-12)]\n\nBut h=48, τ=83, so at T, [48 - 36ΔT, 83 - 36ΔT] where ΔT = T - t1 = T - 12.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, (48,83,left,36)\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFor right-moving, span at T is [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nSo for first car on freeway 3: τ=48? Wait, for right-moving, it says (head, tail) but in the tuple it's given as (h, τ, d, s), but for right-moving, the span is [τ, h] at t1, I think.\n\nFrom the car state: it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for right-moving, \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" so for a car, head and tail are defined, and for right-moving, τ is the tail, h is head, so τ < h.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, Span(t1) = [h, τ], so for left-moving, h and τ, with h and τ, but in the example freeway 1, h=48, τ=83, and 48<83, so if [h,τ] = [48,83], that would be from 48 to 83, but for left-moving, if it's moving left, the span should be decreasing, so [83,48] or something? I think there's inconsistency in notation.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\"\n\nIn freeway 1, (48,83,left,36), so at t1, span is [48,83]. Since moving left, at later T, both decrease.\n\nBut [48,83] means from x=48 to x=83, and since moving left, at T>t1, it shifts left.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h], for example on freeway 3, first car (48,37,right,12), but it says (head h, tail τ), so for this car, h=48, τ=37, d=right.\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [37,48], so from 37 to 48, and moving right, so at T, [37 +12ΔT, 48+12ΔT]\n\nSimilarly, second car on freeway 3: (12,1,right,12), so [τ,h] = [1,12] at t1, moving right.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,12), so [τ,h] = [-35,-24] at t1, moving right.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nFreeway 4 and 5 same as freeway 3: three cars each.\n\nFreeway 6: one car (48,37,right,6) so [τ,h] = [37,48] at t1, moving right with s=6.\n\nFreeway 7: one car (48,37,right,6) same as above.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: (48,37,right,6) and (0,-11,right,6)\n\nFirst car: [37,48] at t1, moving right.\n\nSecond car: (h=0, τ=-11, d=right, s=6), so for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [-11,0] at t1, moving right.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=0 at turn t1=12. y=0 is not a freeway, I think freeways are y=1 to y=8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars. The goal is to reach (0,9), which is also safe.\n\nBut to reach y=9, the player needs to move through y=1 to 8, but must avoid being on a freeway when a car is at x=0.\n\nAlso, the player can stay at y=0 or move up/down.\n\nSince we start at y=0, and need to go to y=9, and minimize turns, probably we want to go up as fast as possible, but avoid the cars.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, at which turns a car is at x=0.\n\nThat is, for each freeway k, find times T when there is a car on k such that 0 is in Span(T) for that car.\n\nThen, when the player is on y=k at turn T, if that T is one of those times, collision.\n\nOtherwise, safe.\n\nAlso, since the player moves at each turn, we need to consider the sequence.\n\nNow, let ΔT = T - 12, so at T=12, ΔT=0.\n\nFor freeway 1: car span at T: [48 - 36ΔT, 83 - 36ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 48 - 36ΔT <= 0 <= 83 - 36ΔT\n\nSimilarly, since 48 - 36ΔT <= 0 and 0 <= 83 - 36ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: 48 - 36ΔT <= 0 => 48 <= 36ΔT => ΔT >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 83 - 36ΔT => 36ΔT <= 83 => ΔT <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305\n\nSo for ΔT from 4/3 to 83/36, which is about 1.333 to 2.305, so at integer ΔT, ΔT=2? ΔT is integer since turns are discrete.\n\nT is turn number, so ΔT = T - 12, integer.\n\nΔT min ceil(4/3) = 2 since 1.333, ceil to 2? Let's see:\n\n48 - 36ΔT <= 0 for ΔT >= ceil(48/36) = ceil(4/3) = 2? 48/36=4/3≈1.333, so for ΔT=1, 48-36=12 >0, not <=0; ΔT=2, 48-72= -24 <=0, yes.\n\n0 <= 83 - 36ΔT for ΔT <= floor(83/36) = floor(2.305) =2\n\n83/36≈2.305, so for ΔT=2, 83-72=11 >=0, yes; ΔT=3, 83-108=-25<0, not >=0.\n\nSo 0 in span only for ΔT=2.\n\nSimilarly, for ΔT=1: 48-36=12, 83-36=47, both >0, 0 not in [12,47]\n\nΔT=2: [48-72,83-72] = [-24,11], and 0 is between -24 and 11, yes.\n\nΔT=3: [48-108,83-108]=[-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at ΔT=2, which is T=12+2=14, car is at x=0 on freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2, same car, same thing, only at T=14.\n\nNow freeway 3: multiple cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12) but for right-moving, span at T: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [37 + 12ΔT, 48 + 12ΔT]\n\n0 in this if 37 +12ΔT <= 0 <= 48 +12ΔT\n\nBut 37+12ΔT <=0? Since ΔT >=0, 37+12ΔT >=37>0, so left end >0, so 0 never in [37+12ΔT,48+12ΔT] since min is 37>0.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12,1,right,12), span [1 +12ΔT, 12 +12ΔT] = [1+12ΔT, 12(1+ΔT)] all positive for ΔT>=0, so 0 not in.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,12)? Car is (h,τ,d,s) = (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFor right-moving, span at t1: [τ, h] = [-35, -24]\n\nAt T: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-35 + 12ΔT, -24 + 12ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -35 +12ΔT <= 0 <= -24 +12ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -35 +12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <=35 => ΔT <= 35/12 ≈2.916, so ΔT <=2 since integer.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -24 +12ΔT => 24 <=12ΔT => ΔT >= 24/12 =2\n\nSo ΔT >=2 and ΔT <=2.916, so ΔT=2\n\nAt ΔT=2, [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], so 0 is included? -11 <=0<=0, yes, since <= and >=, inclusive.\n\nSimilarly, ΔT=3: [-35+36, -24+36]=[1,12], 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSo only at ΔT=2, T=14, for third car on freeway 3.\n\nNow for freeway 4 and 5, same as freeway 3, since same cars, so also at T=14, car at x=0.\n\nFreeway 6: one car (48,37,right,6), span [37 +6ΔT, 48 +6ΔT], all positive, min 37>0, so 0 never in span.\n\nSimilarly freeway 7: same, no car at x=0 ever.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,6), same as above, [37+6ΔT,48+6ΔT] >0, no issue.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,6), so h=0, τ=-11, d=right.\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt T: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-11 +6ΔT, 0 +6ΔT] = [-11+6ΔT, 6ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -11+6ΔT <= 0 <= 6ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -11+6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=11 => ΔT <= 11/6 ≈1.833, so ΔT <=1\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 6ΔT, always true for ΔT >=0, but 0 <=6ΔT, so for ΔT=0, 0<=0 true, but let's see.\n\n0 <= 6ΔT, so ΔT >=0.\n\nBut from first, ΔT <=1.833, so for ΔT=0 and ΔT=1.\n\nAt ΔT=0, T=12, span [-11,0], 0 is included? -11 <=0<=0, yes.\n\nAt ΔT=1, T=13, span [-11+6, 0+6] = [-5,6], 0 in [-5,6], yes.\n\nAt ΔT=2, [-11+12, 0+12]=[1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 8, second car, at ΔT=0 and ΔT=1, i.e., T=12 and T=13, 0 is in span.\n\nAlso, the first car on freeway 8 never has 0 in span.\n\nSo summary of dangerous times for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: T=14\n\n- Freeway 2: T=14\n\n- Freeway 3: T=14 (from the third car)\n\n- Freeway 4: T=14\n\n- Freeway 5: T=14\n\n- Freeway 6: never\n\n- Freeway 7: never\n\n- Freeway 8: T=12 and T=13 (from second car)\n\nAt T=12, freeway 8 has car at x=0.\n\nBut at turn T=12, player is at y=0, not on freeway, so no collision. Collision only if on the freeway at that turn.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,0) at turn t1=12, so at turn 12, y=0, which is not a freeway (freeways are y=1 to 8), so safe.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\nSince freeways 6 and 7 have no cars at x=0 ever, so they are always safe to be on, but we need to pass through or stay.\n\nFreeways 1,2,3,4,5 have danger at T=14, and freeway 8 at T=12 and T=13.\n\nBut T=12 and 13 are past or current? T=12 is now, player at y=0, safe.\n\nT=13 is next turn.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, minimal H, so we want to go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut we have to avoid being on a freeway when it is dangerous.\n\nSpecifically, for freeway 8, dangerous at T=12 and T=13, but T=12 is now, player not on it.\n\nAt T=13, if player is on y=8, collision.\n\nSimilarly, at T=14, if on y=1,2,3,4, or 5, collision.\n\nNow, player starts at y=0 at T=12.\n\nWe can take actions: U, D, S.\n\nIf we go up, to y=1 at T=13.\n\nBut at T=13, freeway 8 is dangerous, but y=1 is not 8, so for y=1, is it dangerous at T=13?\n\nFor freeway 1, dangerous only at T=14, not at T=13. Similarly for others.\n\nAt T=13, which freeways are dangerous?\n\nFrom above:\n\nFreeway 8 at T=13: dangerous, since car at x=0.\n\nOthers: freeway 1 at T=14 only, etc.\n\nSo at T=13, only freeway 8 is dangerous.\n\nFreeway 8 at T=13: yes, as above.\n\nAnd freeways 1-7: at T=13, freeway 1: at ΔT=1, span [48-36,83-36]=[12,47], no 0.\n\nFreeway 2 same.\n\nFreeway 3: cars, first car [37+12,48+12]=[49,60] no; second [1+12,12+12]=[13,24] no; third [-35+12,-24+12]=[-23,-12] no 0.\n\nSimilarly freeway 4,5 same.\n\nFreeway 6,7 never.\n\nFreeway 8: at T=13, ΔT=1, span for second car [-11+6,0+6]=[-5,6], contains 0.\n\nSo only freeway 8 is dangerous at T=13.\n\nAt T=14, freeways 1,2,3,4,5 dangerous.\n\nNow, player at T=12: position y=0.\n\nWe need to choose action at turn T=12, which affects y at T=13.\n\nSimilarly, actions at each turn.\n\nGoal: reach y=9 in min turns.\n\nSince we start at y=0, need to go up 9 times, but we can stay or go down, but that would increase turns, so probably not useful, so we should always go up or stay only if necessary.\n\nMinimal H: if no cars, we could go U 9 times, from T=12 to T=20, y=9 at T=20, H=9 turns? Let's see.\n\nAt turn T, action a_t determines y_{t+1}.\n\nPlayer position: at turn t, position is (0, y_t)\n\nAfter action at t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t.\n\nFor example, at t=12, y=0.\n\nAfter action a_{12}, y_{13} = y_{12} + Δy.\n\nThen at turn t=13, we are at y_{13}, and so on.\n\nCollision at turn T if we are on a freeway, i.e., y_T between 1 and 8, and for that freeway, a car has 0 in span at T.\n\nNow, to reach y=9, we need y_T =9 for some T.\n\nSince we start at y=0, and can move up to +1 per turn, min turns to y=9 is 9 turns, reaching at T=12+9=21? Let's index.\n\nTurn t: 12,13,14,15,... \n\nAt t=12, y=0\n\nAfter a_{12}, y_{13} = 0 or 1 or -1, but y>=0, so if D, y= max(0, -1)=0? y must be in [0,9], so if y=0 and D, y_{t+1}=0; if y=0 and U, y_{t+1}=1; S, y=0.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, U would stay or invalid, but since we stop at y=9, we don't go above.\n\nBut in this case, to go from y=0 to y=9, min 9 up moves, each up move increases y by 1.\n\nSo earliest at t=12+9=21, y=9.\n\nAt t=12, y=0\n\nt=13, y=1 if U\n\nt=14, y=2 if U, and so on, up to t=21, y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns from t1, so from t=12 to t=12+H-1, we have actions, and at t=12+H-1, y=9.\n\nSo for min H, H=9, ending at t=20? Let's set t_start = t1 =12.\n\nWe have actions from t=12 to t=12 + H -1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t=12 + H, position is after last action.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt turn t=12, position y=0.\n\nWe apply a sequence of actions a_{12}, a_{13}, ..., a_{12+H-1}\n\nThen after a_{12+H-1}, y_{12+H} =9.\n\nThe turns when we are at position are t=12,13,14,..., up to t=12+H.\n\nAt each turn t from 12 to 12+H-1, we are at y_t, and we take action to go to y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t, and collision check for y_t if on freeway.\n\nAt turn t=12+H, we are at y=9, which is safe.\n\nFor min H, we want to reach y=9 as soon as possible, so H min such that after H actions, y=9.\n\nSince we start at y=0, and need to reach y=9, with each U increasing by 1, min H=9 actions, from t=12 to t=20, and at t=21, y=9.\n\nt=12: start, y=0\n\na_{12}: action, to y_{13}\n\nt=13: position y_{13}, take action a_{13}, to y_{14}\n\n...\n\nt=20: position y_{20}, take action a_{20}, to y_{21} =9\n\nThen at t=21, position y=9, safe.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t=12 to t=20, 9 actions, H=9.\n\nBut we might have to delay or something to avoid collisions, so H might be more.\n\nBut let's see if we can do it in 9 turns.\n\nNow, during the path, we need that for each turn t from 12 to 20, when at y_t, if y_t in 1-8, it is not dangerous at that t.\n\ny_t at turn t.\n\nNow, dangerous turns:\n\nAs above, for each freeway, times when occupied at x=0.\n\nFreeway 8: occupied at t=12 and t=13\n\nBut t=12: player at y=0, not on freeway, safe.\n\nt=13: if y_{13}=8, collision.\n\nOtherwise safe.\n\nFreeway 1,2,3,4,5 occupied at t=14 only.\n\nFreeway 6,7 never occupied.\n\nFreeway 3,4,5 at t=14, but freeway 3,4,5 are separate.\n\nNow, to go from y=0 to y=9 in 9 turns, we need to be at y=1 at t=13, y=2 at t=14, ..., y=8 at t=20, y=9 at t=21.\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt t=13: y=1, freeway y=1. Is it dangerous at t=13? From above, freeway 1 dangerous only at t=14, not t=13. At t=13, freeway 1: for ΔT=1, span [12,47], no 0, so safe. Similarly freeway 2 same. So y=1 at t=13 is safe.\n\nAt t=14: y=2, freeway 2. At t=14, freeway 2 is dangerous! Because at t=14, ΔT=2, car at x=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 1 also dangerous at t=14.\n\nSo if we are at y=2 at t=14, which is freeway 2, and it is occupied, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we were at y=1 at t=14, also collision, but in the sequence, at t=14 we are at y=2.\n\nIn the min path: at t=14, y=2, freeway 2, dangerous, collision.\n\nSo we cannot be on freeway 2 at t=14.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be on freeway 1,3,4,5 at t=14.\n\nBut at t=14, we need to be at some y, and if y=2, it is bad.\n\nNow, for freeway 6 and 7, safe at all times.\n\nBut at t=14, if we are on y=6 or 7, it would be safe, but in the sequence, at t=14 we are supposed to be at y=2 if going directly up.\n\nTo avoid collision at t=14, we need not to be on y=1,2,3,4,5 at t=14.\n\ny=1,2,3,4,5 are all dangerous at t=14.\n\ny=6 and 7 are safe, y=0 and y=9 are safe but not freeways.\n\nAt t=14, if we are at y=6 or y=7, safe.\n\nBut in the direct path, at t=14 we are at y=2.\n\nSo we need to adjust the path to be at a safe y at t=14.\n\nSimilarly, at t=13, we need to avoid y=8 if possible, but at t=13, only freeway 8 is dangerous, so as long as not y=8 at t=13, it might be ok.\n\nIn the direct path, at t=13, y=1, which is not 8, and freeway 1 is safe at t=13, as above.\n\nSo only issue is at t=14.\n\nNow, options: we can stay or go down at some point to delay or change position.\n\nBut since we want min turns, we should avoid unnecessary moves.\n\nAt t=13, we are at y=1 (if we went up at t=12).\n\nThen at t=13, if we go up, to y=2 at t=14, but collision.\n\nIf we stay at t=13, then y_{14} = y_{13} =1 (if S), then at t=14, y=1, which is freeway 1, dangerous at t=14, collision.\n\nIf we go down at t=13, from y=1, D to y=0 at t=14, then at t=14, y=0, safe, not freeway.\n\nBut then we are back to y=0.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=13 we go to y=1, then at t=13 action, if we do S, y_{14}=1, or U to y=2, or D to y=0.\n\nBut all lead to collision or setback.\n\nPerhaps we can go slower or faster to different rows.\n\nFor example, at t=12, instead of going up to y=1, we stay or something.\n\nBut if we stay at t=12, a_{12}=S, then y_{13}=0, same as start.\n\nThen at t=13, we can go to y=1.\n\nBut at t=13, y=1 is safe, as above.\n\nThen at t=14, if we go to y=2, collision, same problem.\n\nWe need to be at a different y at t=14.\n\nSince freeway 6 and 7 are always safe, we could be at y=6 or y=7 at t=14.\n\nBut to be at y=6 at t=14, for example, we need to have moved faster earlier.\n\nFrom t=12 to t=14, we have two actions.\n\nAt t=12, y=0.\n\nAfter a_{12}, y_{13} = 0 or 1.\n\nAfter a_{13}, y_{14} = y_{13} + Δy.\n\nTo be at y=6 at t=14, we need y_{14}=6.\n\nBut from y=0, in two moves, max y=2 (if U,U), or if we start with U to y=1, then U to y=2, y=2.\n\nCannot reach y=6 in two moves from y=0.\n\nMin y at t=14 is 0, max is 2.\n\ny=0,1,2 possible at t=14.\n\nBut at t=14, y=0: safe, not freeway.\n\ny=1: dangerous (freeway 1)\n\ny=2: dangerous (freeway 2)\n\nSo all possible positions at t=14 are either dangerous or y=0.\n\nBut y=0 is safe, but we are at y=0, which is behind.\n\nThen to reach y=9, it will take more turns.\n\nFor example, if at t=14, we are at y=0, safe.\n\nThen we can start moving up.\n\nBut at t=14, we are at y=0, take action to go to y_{15}, etc.\n\nBut t=14 is after the danger, since after t=14, freeways 1-5 are safe again, only t=14 is bad for them.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 8 only bad at t=12,13.\n\nNow, at t=14, if we are at y=0, we can go up.\n\nSet t=14: y=0\n\nThen a_{14}: to y_{15}, say U to y=1\n\nt=15: y=1, take action, etc.\n\nNow, at t=15: y=1, freeway 1. Is it dangerous? Freeway 1 dangerous only at t=14, not before or after. At t=15, ΔT=3, span [-60,-25], no 0. Similarly, all freeways safe after t=14.\n\nFreeway 8 dangerous only at t=12,13.\n\nSo from t=15 onwards, all freeways are safe to be on.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nFrom t=14 at y=0, to y=9, min 9 moves: actions from t=14 to t=22, to y=9 at t=23.\n\nBut we started at t=12, so from t=12 to t=14, we were at y=0 or moving, but in this case, at t=12 and t=13, we need to be safe.\n\nFirst, how to get to y=0 at t=14.\n\nAt t=12, y=0.\n\nWe need to choose actions so that at t=14, y=0.\n\nFor example, at t=12: if we do S or D, y_{13}=0.\n\nAt t=13: if we do S or D, y_{14}=0.\n\nBut at t=13, if we are at y=0, safe.\n\nBut we can also do other things, but to be at y=0 at t=14.\n\nThen at t=14, y=0, safe.\n\nThen from there, we can go up directly to y=9 in 9 turns: a_{14}=U to y=1 at t=15, a_{15}=U to y=2 at t=16, ..., up to a_{22}=U to y=9 at t=23.\n\nActions: from t=14 to t=22, 9 actions, y from 1 to 9.\n\nBut at t=14, we start actions.\n\nThe sequence: actions from t=12 to t=22? Let's list the turns.\n\nTurn t: position y_t\n\nt=12: y=0\n\nAction a_{12}: determines y_{13}\n\nt=13: y_{13}, action a_{13}, determines y_{14}\n\nt=14: y_{14}, action a_{14}, determines y_{15}\n\n...\n\nTo have y_{14}=0.\n\nThen from t=14 to t=22: 9 actions to go to y_{23}=9.\n\nBut at t=23, y=9.\n\nThe last action is at t=22, to set y_{23}=9.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t=12 to t=12+H-1, actions.\n\nAfter H actions, y_{12+H} =9.\n\nIn this case, from t=12 to t=22, that's 11 actions? t=12 to t=22 inclusive is 11 turns, but actions.\n\nSet k = number of actions.\n\nAction at time t affects y_{t+1}.\n\nAfter k actions, from t=12 to t=12+k-1, y_{12+k} is the position.\n\nSet y_{12+k} =9.\n\nStart: at t=12, before any action, y=0.\n\nAfter first action a_{12}, y_{13}\n\nAfter second action a_{13}, y_{14}\n\n...\n\nAfter m-th action a_{12+m-1}, y_{12+m}\n\nSet y_{12+m} =9.\n\nSince y=0 at start, need exactly 9 up moves to reach y=9, but we can have S or D, which don't increase y, so m >=9.\n\nMin m=9 if all U, but may not be possible due to collisions.\n\nIn the above, to avoid t=14, we stayed at y=0 until t=14.\n\nAt t=12: y=0\n\na_{12}: say S, then y_{13}=0\n\na_{13}: S, then y_{14}=0\n\nThen a_{14}: U, y_{15}=1\n\na_{15}: U, y_{16}=2\n\n...\n\na_{22}: U, y_{23}=9\n\nNow, actions from t=12 to t=22, that's 11 actions: t=12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22.\n\nAfter 11 actions, y_{23}=9.\n\nH is the number of turns, I think H is the number of actions, from t=12 to t=12+H-1.\n\nIn the problem: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" so from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1}, total H actions.\n\nThen after that, position at turn t1 + H should be (0,9), I think.\n\nRead: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd \"after the sequence, at turn t1 + H, position should be (0,9)\", I believe.\n\nFrom the dynamics: after actions up to a_{t1+H-1}, y_{t1+H} is set.\n\nAt turn t1+H, position is (0,9).\n\nIn this case, with above, H=11, from a_{12} to a_{22}, y_{23}=9.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nSince freeways 6 and 7 are always safe, we could go to them faster, but to reach y=6 at t=14, for example, but as before, from y=0 at t=12, to y=6 at t=14, need 6 up moves in 2 actions, impossible, max 2 in two moves.\n\ny_{14} can be at most 2.\n\nAt t=14, we must be at y=0,1, or 2, all problematic except y=0.\n\nBut y=0 is safe.\n\nAnother idea: at t=13, instead of being at y=1, we could be at a different y, but at t=13, from t=12, y_{13} can be 0 or 1.\n\nIf y_{13}=0, then at t=13, y=0, safe.\n\nThen at t=13, we take action, to y_{14}.\n\ny_{14} can be 0 or 1.\n\nIf we go to y=1 at t=14, collision; if y=0, safe but delay.\n\nSo still issue at t=14.\n\nPerhaps we can go to freeway 8 later, but freeway 8 is only dangerous at t=12 and t=13, so after that safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeways 1-5 only dangerous at t=14.\n\nSo the critical turn is t=14 for y=1 to 5.\n\nTo avoid being on y=1,2,3,4,5 at t=14.\n\nAt t=14, we must be on some y, so we need to be on y=0,6,7,8, or 9.\n\nBut y=9 is goal, not reached yet.\n\ny=0,6,7,8 possible.\n\ny=8: freeway 8, at t=14, is it dangerous?\n\nFreeway 8: at t=14, ΔT=2, for the cars.\n\nFirst car: [37+6*2, 48+6*2]=[37+12,48+12]=[49,60] no 0\n\nSecond car: [-11+6*2, 0+12]= [-11+12, 12]= [1,12] no 0\n\nSo at t=14, freeway 8 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 and 7 always safe.\n\ny=0 safe.\n\nSo at t=14, we can be on y=0,6,7,8 safely.\n\nNow, to be on y=6,7, or 8 at t=14, we need to have moved faster earlier.\n\nBut from t=12 to t=14, only two actions, so y_{14} <= y_{12} + 2 = 0 + 2 = 2, since we start at y=0.\n\ny_{12} =0\n\nAfter a_{12}, y_{13} <=1\n\nAfter a_{13}, y_{14} <=2\n\nSo y_{14} <=2, cannot be 6,7,8.\n\nTherefore, at t=14, the only safe positions are y=0 (since y=1 and 2 dangerous).\n\nSo we must be at y=0 at t=14 to avoid collision.\n\nThen from there, we go up.\n\nBut as before, it takes 11 actions to reach y=9 at t=23.\n\nBut is there a way to reach earlier?\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=0 at t=14, but start moving earlier so that we can reach higher faster later, but since the danger is only at t=14, after that all safe, we can go full speed up.\n\nBut from y=0 at t=14, to y=9, min 9 actions, to y=9 at t=23.\n\nActions from t=14 to t=22, but we need to include from t=12.\n\nFrom t=12 to t=13, we need to get to y=0 at t=14.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt t=12: a_{12} = S or D, y_{13} =0\n\nAt t=13: a_{13} = S or D, y_{14} =0\n\nThen at t=14: a_{14} = U, y_{15}=1\n\na_{15} = U, y_{16}=2\n\n...\n\na_{22} = U, y_{23}=9\n\nActions from a_{12} to a_{22}, 11 actions.\n\nH=11, turns from t=12 to t=22.\n\nBut we can use the safe freeways to wait or something, but since we have to be at y=0 at t=14, no choice.\n\nAt t=13, if we go to y=1, but then at t=14, if we could be at y=8, impossible.\n\nAnother idea: go down to y=0 at some point.\n\nFor example, at t=12, go U to y=1 at t=13.\n\nAt t=13, y=1, which is safe at t=13, as established.\n\nThen at t=13, instead of going up, we go down to y=0 at t=14.\n\nThen at t=14, y=0, safe.\n\nThen same as before, start from y=0 at t=14.\n\nBut in this case, at t=13, we did D, from y=1 to y=0.\n\nThen actions: a_{12} = U, y_{13}=1\n\na_{13} = D, y_{14}=0\n\nThen a_{14} = U, y_{15}=1\n\netc., same as before, but we wasted one U and one D, so net zero, but we have extra actions.\n\nIn terms of position, at t=14, y=0, same as if we stayed.\n\nBut we used an extra down move.\n\nIn the first plan, with stay at t=12 and t=13, we have two S actions, which don't change y.\n\nIn this, with U and D, we have one U and one D, net no change, but we moved to y=1 and back, which might not be efficient.\n\nBut in both cases, we end at y=0 at t=14, then need 9 up moves to y=9.\n\nSo min H is 11.\n\nBut perhaps we can reach y=9 earlier by not waiting.\n\nSince freeways 6 and 7 are always safe, we could go directly to them, but to reach y=6, for example, from y=0, we need 6 up moves, so at least at t=18 if we start now, but at t=14, we have to be at y=0, so we can't reach earlier.\n\nAfter t=14, all clear, so we can go up fast.\n\nBut from y=0 at t=14, to y=9 at t=23, it's fixed.\n\nUnless we can be at a higher y at t=14, but we can't, max y=2, but y=2 is dangerous at t=14.\n\ny=1 also dangerous.\n\nSo no, must be at y=0 at t=14.\n\nThus minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 8 at t=12 and t=13.\n\nAt t=13, freeway 8 is dangerous, so we cannot be on y=8 at t=13.\n\nBut in the path, we are not, so ok.\n\nIn the sequence above, we don't go to y=8 until later, when it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, no other dangers.\n\nSo with H=11, we can reach.\n\nBut is there a way with less than 11?\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=9 before t=23.\n\nBut from start, min to y=9 is t=21 with all U, but we have to avoid t=14, which forces a delay.\n\nSince we must spend at least one turn at y=0 or safe, but at t=14, we must be at safe y, which is only y=0, since y=6-8 not reachable.\n\nThus, we have at least one extra turn where we don't progress.\n\nIn the all U path, we progress each turn, but at t=14 we collide.\n\nTo avoid, we need to have a turn where we don't go up, or go down.\n\nIn any case, the net displacement requires 9 up moves, but we have additional actions that don't increase y, so total actions more than 9.\n\nMin additional actions: we need to have y_{14} <=2 and safe, but only y=0 safe, so we need to have y_{14} =0, which means from t=12 to t=14, we have net zero progress (since start y=0, end y=0), so we used two actions to stay or move down and up, but no net gain, so we have two actions that are not up, whereas in min path, all 9 actions are up.\n\nThus, we have 9 up actions plus at least two non-up actions, but not necessarily.\n\nIn the sequence, we have actions that may include S or D.\n\nBut to reach y=9 from y=0, we need exactly 9 up moves, regardless of other moves.\n\nEach U increases y by 1, D decreases, S no change.\n\nTo go from 0 to 9, net +9, so number of U minus number of D must be 9.\n\nNumber of S can be arbitrary.\n\nMin number of actions is when no S or D, all U, 9 actions.\n\nBut with collisions, we may need S or D, increasing total actions.\n\nIn this case, with the delay, we have extra actions.\n\nSpecifically, to have y_{14}=0, we need that from t=12 to t=14, the net change is zero.\n\ny_{14} = y_{12} + sum of Δy from t=12 to t=13 actions? y_{14} depends on actions at t=12 and t=13.\n\ny_{13} = y_{12} + Δy_{12}\n\ny_{14} = y_{13} + Δy_{13} = y_{12} + Δy_{12} + Δy_{13}\n\nSince y_{12}=0, y_{14} = Δy_{12} + Δy_{13}\n\nΔy_t = -1,0,1 for D,S,U.\n\nTo have y_{14}=0, we need Δy_{12} + Δy_{13} =0.\n\nSo either both S, or U and D, or D and U, etc.\n\nIn any case, we have two actions that net zero, so we \"waste\" two actions.\n\nThen from there, we need 9 U to reach y=9.\n\nSo total actions: 2 (waste) + 9 (up) = 11.\n\nIf we have S, it doesn't change, but still, we need the 9 U.\n\nSo min H=11.\n\nAnd we can achieve with, for example:\n\na_{12} = S  (y_{13}=0)\n\na_{13} = S  (y_{14}=0)\n\na_{14} = U  (y_{15}=1)\n\na_{15} = U  (y_{16}=2)\n\na_{16} = U  (y_{17}=3)\n\na_{17} = U  (y_{18}=4)\n\na_{18} = U  (y_{19}=5)\n\na_{19} = U  (y_{20}=6)\n\na_{20} = U  (y_{21}=7)\n\na_{21} = U  (y_{22}=8)\n\na_{22} = U  (y_{23}=9)\n\nIn this, actions from t=12 to t=22, H=11 actions.\n\nAt t=23, y=9.\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nt=12: y=0, safe\n\nt=13: y=0, safe (not freeway)\n\nt=14: y=0, safe\n\nt=15: y=1, freeway 1. At t=15, ΔT=3, span for freeway 1: [48-108,83-108]=[-60,-25] no 0, safe\n\nt=16: y=2, freeway 2, similarly at t=16, ΔT=4, [48-144,83-144]=[-96,-61] no 0, safe\n\nt=17: y=3, freeway 3. Freeway 3 cars: at t=17, ΔT=5\n\nFirst car: [37+60,48+60]=[97,108] no\n\nSecond: [1+60,12+60]=[61,72] no\n\nThird: [-35+60,-24+60]=[25,36] no 0, safe\n\nSimilarly freeway 4,5 same.\n\nt=18: y=4, freeway 4, similarly safe\n\nt=19: y=5, freeway 5, safe\n\nt=20: y=6, freeway 6, always safe\n\nt=21: y=7, freeway 7, always safe\n\nt=22: y=8, freeway 8. At t=22, ΔT=10\n\nFirst car: [37+60,48+60]=[97,108]? s=6 for freeway 8 cars? Freeway 8 first car (48,37,right,6) so [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [37 +6*10, 48+60] ΔT= T-12, t=22, ΔT=10\n\n[37+60, 48+60]= [97,108] no 0\n\nSecond car: [-11 +6*10, 0+60]= [-11+60,60]= [49,60] no 0, safe\n\nt=23: y=9, safe, goal.\n\nAll safe.\n\nWith a_{12}=S and a_{13}=S.\n\nWe could have a_{12}=U, a_{13}=D, then y_{13}=1, y_{14}=0.\n\nThen same from a_{14} to a_{22} U, y from 1 to 9.\n\nBut at t=13, y=1, which is safe, as freeway 1 not occupied at t=13.\n\nThen at t=14, y=0, safe.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nBut in this case, we have one more action? No, same number: a_{12} to a_{22}, 11 actions.\n\nIn this case, a_{12}=U, a_{13}=D, then a_{14}=U, ..., a_{22}=U.\n\ny_{13}=1, y_{14}=0, y_{15}=1, etc., up to y_{23}=9.\n\nSame H.\n\nBut with U and D, we moved unnecessarily.\n\nWith S,S, we stay, which is fine.\n\nNow, is there a way with H=10?\n\nSuppose H=10 actions, then y_{22} should be 9? After 10 actions, y_{12+10}=y_{22}=9.\n\nBut to have y_{22}=9, with start y_{12}=0, we need net +9, so 9 U and possibly other moves, but with 10 actions, we must have 9 U and one S or D, but S or D doesn't help, it would require y to be less or same at some point.\n\nBut the issue is at t=14.\n\nWith H=10, actions from t=12 to t=21.\n\nAfter a_{21}, y_{22}=9.\n\nNow, positions: at t=12 to t=21.\n\nAt t=14, we need y_{14} to be safe, i.e., y_{14}=0 or 6,7,8 but y_{14} <=2 as before, so must be 0.\n\nThen y_{14}=0.\n\nThen from y_{14}=0 to y_{22}=9, we need 9 up moves.\n\nBut actions from t=14 to t=21 are 8 actions (t=14 to t=21, 8 actions: a14 to a21).\n\nAfter 8 actions, y_{22} = y_{14} + sum Δy from t=14 to t=21 actions.\n\ny_{14}=0, so y_{22} = sum of 8 Δy.\n\nEach Δy <=1, so y_{22} <=8, cannot be 9.\n\nIf we have all U, y_{22}=8.\n\nBut we need y_{22}=9, impossible with 8 actions from y=0.\n\ny_{14}=0, after actions a14 to a21 (8 actions), y_{22} <=8.\n\nCannot reach 9.\n\nThus with y_{14}=0, we need at least 9 actions after to reach y=9, so actions from t=14 to t=22 (9 actions), y_{23}=9.\n\nThus min H=11, with actions from t=12 to t=22.\n\nIn the sequence, we can have the two initial actions as S or one U and one D, but S,S is simpler.\n\nNow, for the answer, we need to output the actions.\n\nAlso, in the car state, freeway 8 has a car at t=12 and t=13, but since player not on it, ok.\n\nAnother thing: at t=13, if we were on y=8, collision, but we are not.\n\nIn our sequence, we are on y=0 or y=1, not 8.\n\nSo all fine.\n\nThus minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, sequence: for example:\n\nTurn 12: S\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nAfter a_{22}, y_{23}=9.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=12 to t=22.\n\nIn the box, we need to list for each turn.\n\nt1=12.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 12: S\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 22: U\n\nBut Turn 22 is t=12 + 10? t from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nH=11, so turns t=12 to 12+10=22.\n\nYes.\n\nWe could have Turn 12: U, Turn 13: D, then Turn 14: U, etc., but same H.\n\nS,S is fine.\n\nNow, in the output, it should be in the format.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach earlier by using freeway 6 or 7.\n\nFor example, suppose we go to y=6 as soon as possible, but from y=0, at t=12, go U to y=1 at t=13.\n\nAt t=13, y=1, safe.\n\nThen at t=13, go U to y=2 at t=14, but at t=14, y=2, collision, not possible.\n\nGo to y=0 at t=14 as before.\n\nNo, so min H=11.\n\nPerhaps stay at y=0 longer, but that would be worse.\n\nSo I think 11 is min.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we need to list actions.\n\nIn the sequence above, from turn 14 to 22, we go up each time, but we pass through freeways 1 to 8, but after t=14, all safe, so no issue.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=15, y=1; t=16,y=2; ... up to t=22,y=8; then after action U, y=9 at t=23.\n\nAll safe as checked.\n\nSo the action sequence is:\n\nTurn 12: S\n\nTurn 13: S\n\nTurn 14: U\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: U\n\nTurn 17: U\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nIn the answer format, it should be boxed.\n\nBut let's write it clearly.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 12\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 11. This sequence ensures that the player is never on a freeway \\(y\\) at a turn \\(T\\) where a car occupies \\(x = 0\\) on that freeway.\n\n### Key Points from Analysis:\n- **Dangerous Turns and Freeways**:\n  - Freeway 8 is dangerous at turns \\(T = 12\\) and \\(T = 13\\) due to a car at \\(x = 0\\).\n  - Freeways 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are dangerous at turn \\(T = 14\\) due to cars at \\(x = 0\\).\n  - Freeways 6 and 7 are always safe, as no car occupies \\(x = 0\\) at any turn.\n- **Player Movement Constraints**:\n  - Starting at \\(y = 0\\) at turn 12, the player must avoid being on freeways 1-5 at turn 14 and freeway 8 at turns 12 and 13.\n  - At turn 14, the only safe position is \\(y = 0\\) (since \\(y = 1\\) and \\(y = 2\\) are dangerous, and higher \\(y\\) values are unreachable in two moves from \\(y = 0\\)).\n  - After turn 14, all freeways are safe, allowing full-speed upward movement.\n- **Minimal Turns Calculation**:\n  - To be at \\(y = 0\\) at turn 14, the player must take actions at turns 12 and 13 that result in no net vertical change (e.g., two stays (S) or one up (U) followed by one down (D)).\n  - From \\(y = 0\\) at turn 14, 9 upward moves (U) are required to reach \\(y = 9\\), taking 9 turns.\n  - Thus, total turns \\(H = 2\\) (to stay at \\(y = 0\\)) + \\(9\\) (to reach \\(y = 9\\)) = 11.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence of actions from turn 12 to turn 22 (11 actions) achieves \\(y = 9\\) at turn 23:\n- Turns 12 and 13: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 0\\), avoiding danger on freeway 8 at turn 13 and ensuring safety at turn 14.\n- Turns 14 to 22: Move up (U) each turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 23, taking advantage of safe freeways after turn 14.\n\nCollision checks confirm safety:\n- Turn 12: \\(y = 0\\) (safe, not a freeway).\n- Turn 13: \\(y = 0\\) (safe, not a freeway).\n- Turn 14: \\(y = 0\\) (safe, not a freeway).\n- Turn 15: \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1 safe, no car at \\(x=0\\)).\n- Turn 16: \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2 safe, no car at \\(x=0\\)).\n- Turn 17: \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3 safe, no car at \\(x=0\\)).\n- Turn 18: \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4 safe, no car at \\(x=0\\)).\n- Turn 19: \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5 safe, no car at \\(x=0\\)).\n- Turn 20: \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6 always safe).\n- Turn 21: \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7 always safe).\n- Turn 22: \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8 safe, no car at \\(x=0\\)).\n- Turn 23: \\(y = 9\\) (goal, safe).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 12: S \\\\\nTurn 13: S \\\\\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: U \\\\\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U \\\\\nTurn 19: U \\\\\nTurn 20: U \\\\\nTurn 21: U \\\\\nTurn 22: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 13, and the player is at (0,0). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns, avoiding collisions.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at that turn, and at that same turn, for the car on that freeway, the x-coordinate 0 is within the car's span at turn T.\n\nNote: The player updates position at the same time as the cars move. When we take an action at turn t, we move to the next y at turn t+1. However, note the collision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T, then we check the cars on that freeway at turn T.\n\nAlso note: if at turn T we are on freeway k, then we check the cars on freeway k at turn T. When we move (U or D) at turn T, then at turn T we are still on the old row, and at turn T+1 we are on the new row. So when we are at turn T, we are on the row we were at the beginning of the turn, and then we move at the end of the turn to the new row.\n\nTherefore, the movement and car positions are synchronized by turn.\n\nWe are given the car states at turn t1=13. We need to compute the car positions at future turns.\n\nWe have 8 freeways (y=1 to y=8). Each freeway has a set of cars. Each car is given by (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nNote: For left-moving cars (d='left'), the car moves to the left. The span at turn t1 is [h, τ] (with h > τ because it's left-moving? Actually, the problem says: left-moving: span(t1)=[h, τ] -> at T: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\nSimilarly, right-moving: [τ, h] -> at T: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note the representation: for left-moving, they give (head, tail) and then the head is the rightmost? Actually, the problem says for left-moving: the car span at t1 is [h, τ]. Then as time goes, the car moves left so the head (which was at h) moves to h - s*(T-t1) and the tail (at τ) moves to τ - s*(T-t1). So the entire segment shifts left.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: they say span(t1)=[τ, h] meaning from τ to h (with τ < h) and then at T, it becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut in the input, for freeway 3,4,5 we have: (60,49,right,12) ... but 60>49, so if it's right-moving and the span is [τ, h] then it should be [49,60]? Then at T=13, the car is from 49 to 60? But then at future turn T, it will be [49+12*(T-13), 60+12*(T-13)].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: freeway 1: (12,47,left,36) -> wait, 12 and 47? 12<47, so if it's left-moving, the span is [h,τ] = [12,47]? But then at T, [12-36*(T-13), 47-36*(T-13)]. This would mean the car is from 12 to 47 at T=13, and moves left at 36 units per turn.\n\nBut note: the problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1)=[h,τ]\" and then becomes [h-s*(T-t1), τ-s*(T-t1)]. So if h=12 and τ=47, then the car is from 12 to 47? But then moving left, the entire segment shifts left. However, typically we expect the head to be the front, so for a left-moving car the head should be the leftmost? But here the head is given as 12 and tail as 47? That would imply the car is from 12 to 47, which is 36 units long (because 47-12+1=36? but note: the problem doesn't specify if the span is inclusive of endpoints). The length is (47-12) = 35? Actually, the problem doesn't specify the length, but we can compute the length as |h - τ| + 1? But note: the update rule: the entire segment shifts.\n\nHowever, there's a potential confusion: in the left-moving car, if at t1 the car is at [12,47] and moves left, then at T=14, it becomes [12-36,47-36] = [-24,11]. Then at T=13, the car occupies x from 12 to 47? Then at T=13, if the player is at (0,1) (freeway 1) then we need to check if 0 is in [12,47]? It's not. So no collision at T=13 for freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 3,4,5: the first car (60,49,right,12): at T=13, the car is [49,60]? Then 0 is not in [49,60]. But note: the problem says for right-moving: [τ, h] -> [49,60] at T=13. Then at T=14: [49+12,60+12]=[61,72]. So we are safe.\n\nBut wait, freeway 8 has: (54,43,right,6) and (6,-5,right,6). For the second car: at T=13, the car is [ -5, 6]? Then 0 is in [-5,6]? So at T=13, if the player is on freeway 8 at x=0, then collision? But we start at T=13 at (0,0) which is not on freeway 8 (freeways are 1-8, and we are at y=0). So we are safe at T=13.\n\nOur goal: we start at (0,0) at T=13. We must reach (0,9) at some turn T = 13+H-1, meaning we take H actions (from t=13 to t=13+H-1) and then at turn 13+H-1 we are at y=9.\n\nWe can take actions: U (up: y+1), D (down: y-1), S (stay: y same). We must stay in [0,9].\n\nWe need to avoid collisions at every turn from T=13 to T=13+H-1? But note: at turn T, we are on freeway y_T. However, we start at y0=0 at T=13. Then at T=13, we are not on any freeway (since freeways are 1-8) so no collision. Similarly, when we are at y=9, that's the goal and also not a freeway? The problem says: freeways are y=1,...,8. So y=0 and y=9 are safe.\n\nTherefore, we only need to worry when we are on rows 1 to 8.\n\nWe need to compute for each freeway k (1 to 8) and for each car on that freeway, the time intervals (if any) during which the car occupies x=0.\n\nBut note: the car is a moving segment. For a given car, at turn T, the segment is [A(T), B(T)] (with A<=B). We need 0 in [A(T), B(T)].\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway k, the set of turns T (>=13) for which at least one car on freeway k has 0 in its span.\n\nThen, for our path, when we are on freeway k at turn T, we must avoid T being in the set of dangerous turns for freeway k.\n\nWe are to find a sequence of actions (U, D, S) that moves from y=0 at T=13 to y=9 at some turn T, with minimal H (number of actions, so turns taken). The path is a sequence of y-coordinates: y13, y14, ... until we hit y=9.\n\nConstraints:\n- At T=13: y13=0 (safe)\n- For each T from 13 to the last turn (before we reach 9), we have yT in [0,9] and if yT is in [1,8] then we must not have a collision on that freeway at turn T.\n\nWe are free to choose actions. The actions change y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\nWe want the minimal H (the number of turns from T=13 to T=13+H-1) such that y_{13+H-1}=9.\n\nWe can model this as a state: (turn, y). But note: the dangerous sets for freeways depend on the turn. Since the cars move linearly, we can compute the dangerous intervals for each freeway.\n\nWe'll precompute for each freeway k, the set of turns T (>=13) for which there is a car on k such that 0 is in its span at T.\n\nHow to compute for one car?\n\nExample: left-moving car: (h, τ, 'left', s) at initial turn t0=13.\nThe car at turn T: [h - s*(T-13), τ - s*(T-13)]\nWe require: h - s*(T-13) <= 0 <= τ - s*(T-13)   [because the segment is [h-s*(T-13), τ-s*(T-13)] and note that for left-moving, at T0 the segment is [h,τ] and since the car moves left, the entire segment decreases. But note: if h < τ, then the segment is from h to τ? Actually, the problem says for left-moving: [h, τ] -> and then shifts left. But if h < τ, then the segment is increasing? The representation: [h,τ] with h=12, τ=47: so the segment is from 12 to 47? Then 0 is in [12,47]? No. Then when does 0 become in the segment? We require:\n\nh - s*(T-13) <= 0 <= τ - s*(T-13)\n\nBut note: if h < τ, then the segment is [h, τ] meaning from h to τ (inclusive). Then we require:\nh - s*(T-13) <= 0 <= τ - s*(T-13)\n\nBut note: if the car moves left, the entire segment moves left. So the left endpoint is h - s*(T-13) and the right endpoint is τ - s*(T-13). Since h < τ, then the segment is [h, τ] and then after shifting, it's [h - s*(T-13), τ - s*(T-13)].\n\nSo the condition is:\nh - s*(T-13) <= 0 <= τ - s*(T-13)\n\nSolve for T:\n\nFrom the left: h - s*(T-13) <= 0  => T-13 >= h/s   => T >= 13 + ceil(h/s) ? But we have to be careful: because we require 0 to be at least the left endpoint and at most the right endpoint.\n\nActually, we can write:\n\n0 >= h - s*(T-13)  => s*(T-13) >= h  => T-13 >= ceil(h/s)   [if h/s is not integer, then we need to round up? Actually, we are in integers? The positions are integers? The problem doesn't specify, but the given numbers are integers. So we can use real inequalities and then take integer T.\n\nBut note: T is integer. So we can write:\n\nLet dT = T-13 (nonnegative integer).\n\nCondition:\nh - s * dT <= 0   => dT >= h / s\nand\n0 <= τ - s * dT   => s * dT <= τ   => dT <= τ / s\n\nSo we need dT in [ ceil(h/s), floor(τ/s) ]? But note: if h/s is not integer, then dT must be at least ceil(h/s). Similarly, τ/s might not be integer, then dT must be at most floor(τ/s). But note: the condition is:\n\nh - s*dT <= 0   => dT >= h/s   -> since dT integer, dT >= ceil(h/s) if h/s not integer? Actually, no: if h/s is fractional, then we need dT to be at least the next integer. Similarly, for the upper bound: τ - s*dT >=0 => dT <= τ/s. So dT <= floor(τ/s) if τ/s is not integer? Actually, we can use:\n\ndT_min = ceil(h / s)   [if h/s is integer, then ceil(h/s)=h/s, and we can take dT>=h/s]\ndT_max = floor(τ / s)   [if τ/s is integer, then floor(τ/s)=τ/s]\n\nBut note: if h/s is integer, then at dT = h/s, we have h - s*(h/s)=0, so the left endpoint is 0 -> 0 is included. Similarly, if τ/s is integer, at dT=τ/s, the right endpoint is 0? Actually, at dT=τ/s: τ - s*(τ/s)=0, so 0 is the right endpoint. So the condition is satisfied.\n\nSo the dangerous dT (relative to t0=13) for a left-moving car is the integers dT in [ceil(h/s), floor(τ/s)].\n\nBut wait: in the example freeway 1: h=12, τ=47, s=36. Then:\ndT_min = ceil(12/36) = ceil(0.333)=1\ndT_max = floor(47/36)= floor(1.305)=1\n\nSo only dT=1 -> T=13+1=14.\n\nAt T=14: the car is at [12-36, 47-36] = [-24,11]. Then 0 is in [-24,11]? Yes. So at T=14, if the player is on freeway 1, then collision.\n\nSimilarly, for a right-moving car: (τ, h, 'right', s) -> at T: [τ + s*dT, h + s*dT]\n\nCondition for 0 in the segment: \nτ + s*dT <= 0 <= h + s*dT\n\nBut note: the segment is [τ+s*dT, h+s*dT] and we require 0 to be in between.\n\nSo:\nτ + s*dT <= 0   => dT <= -τ / s   [if τ is negative, then -τ is positive]\nand\n0 <= h + s*dT   => dT >= -h / s   [if h is negative, then -h is positive]\n\nBut wait: in freeway 8, we have a car (6,-5,right,6): \nHere, the representation is (head, tail, direction, speed) = (6, -5, right, 6). But for right-moving, the problem says: [τ, h] at T0? But in the input, it's (6, -5) and direction right. So which is τ and which is h? The problem says: for right-moving: [τ, h] -> then at T: [τ+s*(T-13), h+s*(T-13)]. And the input gives (head, tail) as (6, -5). But in the representation for right-moving, it says \"head\" and \"tail\"? Actually, the problem says: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\". \n\nBut for right-moving, the head is the front? Then the head would be the rightmost. So the tail τ is the leftmost. Therefore, for a right-moving car, the span is [τ, h] meaning from τ (left) to h (right). So in the car (6,-5,right,6): head=6, tail=-5? Then the span at T0 is [τ, h] = [-5,6]. Then at T, it becomes [-5+6*dT, 6+6*dT].\n\nThen condition for 0 in the segment: \n-5+6*dT <= 0 <= 6+6*dT\n\nThe right part (0<=6+6*dT) is always true for dT>=0 because 6+6*dT>=6>0? Actually, at dT=0: 6>0 -> true. The left part: -5+6*dT <=0 -> 6*dT<=5 -> dT<=5/6 -> so dT=0? Then at T=13, the car is at [-5,6] and 0 is in there? Yes.\n\nBut wait, the car is given at T0=13. So at T=13, the car (6,-5,right,6) on freeway 8: we have 0 in [-5,6] -> dangerous at T=13 for freeway 8? But we are at T=13 at y=0, so we are not on freeway 8. So we are safe.\n\nNow, when else? The condition: -5+6*dT <=0 -> dT<=5/6 -> so only dT=0? Then only T=13 is dangerous for freeway 8 for that car? But what about the other car on freeway 8: (54,43,right,6). Let's check:\n\n(54,43,right,6): head=54, tail=43? Then for right-moving, the span is [43,54] at T0. Then at T, [43+6*dT,54+6*dT]. Then 0 in [43+6*dT,54+6*dT]? Since 43+6*dT>=43>0 for dT>=0, so never.\n\nSo for freeway 8, only the car (6,-5,right,6) causes danger at T=13? But we are not there at T=13. Then at T>13? The condition for that car: only dT=0? So only T=13. Therefore, freeway 8 is safe for T>=14? \n\nBut wait: the condition for the car (6,-5,right,6): we had dT<=5/6 -> so only dT=0? Then only T=13.\n\nNow, let's compute for every freeway the dangerous turns (T>=13).\n\nFreeway 1: only car (12,47,left,36): \n  dT_min = ceil(12/36)=ceil(1/3)=1\n  dT_max = floor(47/36)=floor(1.305)=1\n  So T=14.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway1: T=14.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: \n  (60,49,right,12): head=60, tail=49 -> for right-moving: [49,60] at T0. Then 0 in [49+12*dT,60+12*dT]? Since 49+12*dT>=49>0 for dT>=0 -> never.\n  (24,13,right,12): [13,24] -> 0 in [13+12*dT,24+12*dT]? Minimum 13>0 -> never.\n  (-12,-23,right,12): head=-12, tail=-23 -> then [τ, h] = [-23, -12] at T0. Then condition: \n      -23+12*dT <= 0 <= -12+12*dT\n  The right part: 0<=-12+12*dT -> 12*dT>=12 -> dT>=1.\n  The left part: -23+12*dT<=0 -> 12*dT<=23 -> dT<=23/12=1.916 -> so dT=1? Then T=14.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway3: dangerous at T=14.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway3: dangerous at T=14.\n\nFreeway 6: (54,43,right,6): [43,54] -> always positive, never.\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway6: safe.\n\nFreeway 8: \n  (54,43,right,6): safe as above.\n  (6,-5,right,6): only dangerous at T=13 (as above).\n\nSo summary of dangerous turns for each freeway (T>=13):\n\nFreeway 1: {14}\nFreeway 2: {14}\nFreeway 3: {14}   [from the car (-12,-23,right,12) at T=14: [ -23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? Actually, at dT=1: [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0]. Then 0 is in [-11,0]? Yes, at the right endpoint. So indeed T=14 is dangerous for freeway3? But wait: the condition for the car (-12,-23,right,12): at T0=13, the car is at [-23,-12]. Then at T=14: [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0]. Then 0 is in the segment? Yes. So freeway3 is dangerous at T=14.\n\nSimilarly, freeway4 and 5: same.\n\nFreeway8: only T=13.\n\nNow, we need to plan a path from y=0 at T=13 to y=9 as quickly as possible, avoiding being on a freeway at a dangerous turn.\n\nWe are at (T=13, y=0). We can take actions: U, D, S.\n\nWe want to get to y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of moves: we need at least 9 moves (if we only go up). But we might have to wait (S) to avoid dangerous times.\n\nWe can model by building a graph of states (T, y) and then do a BFS to find the minimal T (or minimal H, but note H = (T - 13 + 1) because at T=13 we are at step0? Actually, we take actions from T=13 to T=13+H-1, and then at T=13+H-1 we are at y=9. So the number of actions is H, and the time at the last step is T=13+H-1.\n\nWe want minimal H.\n\nWe can do BFS in terms of the number of steps. Let step t (starting at t=0 for the first action at T=13) up to step H-1.\n\nBut note: the state at step k (after k actions) is at time T = 13 + k, and at position y_k.\n\nWe start: k=0: T=13, y=0 -> safe.\n\nThen we take an action at T=13 to move to y_14 (at T=14) or stay at y=0 (then at T=14 we are still at y=0) but note: we are at T=14 at y=0? Actually, we take an action at T=13: \n  if we do S: then at T=14 we are still at y=0? \n  But the update: at T=13: we take action a_13, then y_{14} = y_13 + Delta y_{13}.\n\nSo at T=14, we are at y_14.\n\nBut at T=13, we are at y=0 (safe). Then we take an action at T=13 that determines y_14.\n\nThen at T=14, we are at y_14. Then we must check: if y_14 is in [1,8], then we must check that T=14 is not dangerous for freeway y_14.\n\nSimilarly, we continue.\n\nWe want to get to y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nConstraints: y must be in [0,9].\n\nWe can do BFS:\n\nLet dist[k][y] = the minimal number of actions (which is k) to be at y at time T=13+k? Actually, after k actions, we are at time T=13+k and at position y.\n\nWe start at k=0: T=13, y=0 -> dist[0][0]=0.\n\nThen for k from 0 to ... until we find y=9.\n\nAt state (k,y), we take an action a that leads to next y' = y + delta, where delta = { -1,0,1 } for D,S,U respectively.\n\nThen next state: (k+1, y') at time T=13+k+1.\n\nWe then check: if y' is in [1,8] then we must check that freeway y' is not dangerous at time T=13+k+1.\n\nIf it is dangerous at that time, we skip.\n\nAlso, y' must be in [0,9].\n\nWe stop when we reach y=9 (at any k).\n\nWe want the minimal k such that we are at y=9.\n\nThen k is H? But note: the number of actions is H, and we take actions from T=13 to T=13+H-1, and then at T=13+H-1 we are at y=9. So the number of actions is H, and the last action is at T=13+H-1.\n\nIn our BFS, k is the number of actions taken. So when we are at (k, y), we have taken k actions and are at time T=13+k. We want to be at y=9 at some k.\n\nSo we do:\n\nInitialize:\n  k=0: state (0,0) -> safe.\n\nThen from state (k, y), we try three actions: \n  a = S: y_next = y\n  a = U: y_next = y+1\n  a = D: y_next = y-1   (if within [0,9])\n\nThen the next state is (k+1, y_next) at time T = 13 + (k+1)\n\nThen we check: if y_next is in [1,8], then we must check that freeway y_next is not dangerous at time T = 13+k+1.\n\nIf safe, then we mark that state and record the action.\n\nWe stop when we first get to y_next=9 (and safe, but y=9 is not a freeway, so safe).\n\nWe record the path.\n\nWe must avoid loops? But since we are going from 0 to 9 and we can go down, we might get stuck. But we are doing BFS by k (number of steps), and we want minimal steps. So we mark states (k,y) and we can revisit a state (y) at a later k? But that k would be larger so we don't want to. Actually, the state (y) at a higher k is not useful because we want minimal k. So we can use a visited array per (k,y) but k increases. Alternatively, we can use a visited array for (y, time) but time goes to infinity? Actually, we are doing BFS by k (which is the number of steps, and time is 13+k). Since we want minimal steps, we break when we reach y=9.\n\nBut note: we might have to wait arbitrarily? However, the dangerous sets are periodic? Actually, no: the cars move linearly and eventually leave the x=0 point. But in our case, we computed the dangerous turns as finite sets.\n\nFor example, freeway1: only dangerous at T=14. Freeway3: only at T=14. Freeway8: only at T=13.\n\nSo beyond T=14, all freeways are safe? \n\nLet me check:\n\nFreeway1: only T=14.\nFreeway2: only T=14.\nFreeway3: only T=14? But what about the car (-12,-23,right,12): \n  At T=15: the car becomes [-23+12*2, -12+12*2] = [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n  Similarly, the other cars are always positive? So yes, only T=14 for freeways 1-5 and freeway8 only T=13.\n\nFreeway6 and 7: always safe.\n\nSo for T>=15, all freeways are safe? Then after T=14, we can move freely.\n\nSo the dangerous times are only T=13 (for freeway8) and T=14 (for freeways 1-5). But T=13: we are at y=0 (safe). Then at T=14, we are at y1 (which we set by the action at T=13). Then at T=15, we are at y2, and so on.\n\nWe want to get to y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nMinimal steps: we need at least 9 steps (if we go up every time). But we might have to avoid being on a dangerous freeway at T=14.\n\nAt T=14 (which is the time after the first action), we are at y14. We must avoid being on freeways 1,2,3,4,5 at T=14.\n\nSo at T=14, we cannot be on y=1,2,3,4,5.\n\nWe can be on y=0,6,7,8, or 9? But we start at y=0 at T=13. Then at T=14, we can be at:\n\n- If we do S: y=0 -> safe (not a freeway)\n- If we do U: y=1 -> dangerous (freeway1 at T=14) -> skip\n- If we do D: y=-1 -> invalid.\n\nSo at T=14, we can only be at y=0 (if we do S) or if we do U we get to y=1 which is dangerous. So we cannot go up at the first step? Then we must do S at T=13? Then at T=14 we are at y=0.\n\nThen at T=14, we are at y=0. Then we take an action at T=14: \n  S: stay at 0 -> then at T=15: y=0\n  U: go to 1 -> at T=15: y=1 -> freeway1 at T=15? But freeway1 is only dangerous at T=14 -> safe? So we can go to 1 at T=15.\n\nBut note: we want to get to 9 as fast as possible.\n\nAfter T=14, all freeways are safe. So we can go up as fast as possible.\n\nSo if we do:\n\nT=13: S -> then at T=14: y=0\nT=14: U -> then at T=15: y=1 (safe, because freeway1 is only dangerous at T=14, not at T=15)\nThen T=15: U -> y=2 (freeway2: safe because after T=14 it's safe) -> T=16: y=2 -> then U to 3, then U to 4, then U to 5, then U to 6, then U to 7, then U to 8, then U to 9.\n\nThat would be: \n  T13: S\n  T14: U -> then at T15: y=1\n  T15: U -> y=2\n  T16: U -> y=3\n  T17: U -> y=4\n  T18: U -> y=5\n  T19: U -> y=6\n  T20: U -> y=7\n  T21: U -> y=8\n  T22: U -> y=9 -> reached at T=22.\n\nNumber of actions: 9? But wait, we did 10 actions: from T13 to T22? \n\nWe start at T13: we take an action at T13 (S) -> then at T14: y=0.\nThen we take an action at T14 (U) -> at T15: y=1.\nThen T15: U -> T16: y=2.\n...\nT21: U -> T22: y=9.\n\nSo we took actions at T13, T14, T15, ... T21: that's 9 actions? Then H=9, and we reach at T=22 = 13+9-1? Actually, the last action is at T21, and then at T21 we are at y=9? But wait: the update: at T21 we take action U (if we are at y=8) then at T22 we are at y=9. So at T22 we are at y=9. And T22 = 13 + 9? Then 13+9=22 -> so the number of actions is 9, and H=9.\n\nBut note: we started at T13 and took actions at T13, T14, ..., T21 (9 actions) and at T22 we are at y=9.\n\nBut we need to be at y9 at the last action? Actually, the problem: we take actions from t= t1 to t1+H-1, and then at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). But note: at the turn when we take the last action, we are at the beginning of the turn at the previous y, and then we move to the new y at the end of the turn. So at the turn we take the last action (say at T), then we are at the new y at T+1? \n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning we take actions at times: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then we require that at turn t1+H-1 (the last turn we act) we end up at (0,9). But note: at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at some y_prev, and then we take an action that moves us to (0,9) at the end of the turn? But the position at the end of the turn is the position at the next turn.\n\nActually, the state at the end of the turn (after action) is the state for the next turn. So:\n\nAt turn T: we start at (0, y_T), then we take action a_T, then we update to y_{T+1} = y_T + Delta.\n\nThen at turn T+1, we are at (0, y_{T+1}).\n\nTherefore, when we take the last action at T = t1+H-1, then at turn T+1 we are at the new position. But the problem requires that we are at (0,9) at turn T (the last action turn)? Or at the next turn?\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". \n\nRe-read: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9), ...\"\n\nAnd: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nSo we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut when? At the beginning of turn t1+H-1? Or at the end? \n\nThe state at the beginning of turn t is (0, y_t). Then we take action a_t, and then we update to y_{t+1} for the beginning of turn t+1.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\".\n\nSo at the beginning of turn t, we are at y_t. Then we take action a_t, and then at the beginning of turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nTherefore, the position at the beginning of turn t is (0, y_t).\n\nWe require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nBut how did we get there? By the action taken at the previous turn (t1+H-2). \n\nSo we must have taken an action at turn t1+H-2 that moved us from y_{t1+H-2} to y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nTherefore, we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\nIn our BFS, we model: at step k (after k actions) we are at time T = t1 + k (so the beginning of turn t1+k) at position y.\n\nWe want to be at y=9 at step k, meaning at time t1+k.\n\nThen k = H? But note: we took k actions to get to that state. The actions were taken at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+k-1.\n\nBut the requirement is that we are at y=9 at turn t1+H-1. So if we are at y=9 at time t1+k, then we require t1+k = t1+H-1 -> k = H-1.\n\nTherefore, we are looking for the minimal H such that we can be at y=9 at time T = t1 + (H-1). And we took H-1 actions? \n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning H actions. And then we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo: \n  actions taken at: t1 (t=0), t1+1 (t=1), ... t1+H-1 (t=H-1) -> H actions.\n  and at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nBut how? The action taken at turn t1+H-1: we are at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 at y_{t1+H-1}=9. Then we take an action? But that action would update to y_{t1+H} for the next turn. \n\nThis seems inconsistent.\n\nRe-read the problem: \n  \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nSo we require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nBut how did we get to y=9? By the action taken at turn t1+H-2. Then at turn t1+H-2, we were at y_{t1+H-2} and we took an action (say U) to become y_{t1+H-2} + 1 = 9? \n\nThen at turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9. But then we do not take an action at turn t1+H-1? But the sequence includes actions from t1 to t1+H-1, meaning the last action is at turn t1+H-1.\n\nBut if we take an action at turn t1+H-1, then we update to y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Delta, so we leave 9? \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \n  \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nand \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nBut note: the sequence has H actions: from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1. Then we are at y_{t1+H-1}=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? But after taking the last action (at t1+H-1), we update to y_{t1+H}. \n\nThere seems to be a discrepancy.\n\nLooking at the player update: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nSo after taking action a_t at turn t, we update to y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nTherefore, to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn T, we must have been updated to that state by an action taken at turn T-1.\n\nSo if we want to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn T, then T must be t1+H-1, and the action that got us there was taken at turn T-1 = t1+H-2.\n\nBut the sequence of actions includes an action at turn t1+H-1? That would then update us to y_{t1+H} at the next turn.\n\nSo we would not be at y=9 at the end of the sequence? \n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\", meaning at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? And then we take an action at turn t1+H-1? But then we move away.\n\nThis is likely a misunderstanding.\n\nAlternative interpretation: \n  We take actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ... , t1+H-1 (H actions). Then the state at the end of the last action (i.e., at the beginning of turn t1+H) is y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\", not y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nSo the problem explicitly says: at turn t1+H-1 we are at y=9.\n\nTherefore, we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1.\n\nThen the action taken at turn t1+H-1 would then update us to y_{t1+H} = 9 + Delta, which might not be 9.\n\nBut the problem does not require to stay at 9, only to reach it at that turn.\n\nSo we are done at the beginning of turn t1+H-1: we have reached (0,9). Then we can take an arbitrary action? But the problem requires a sequence of H actions.\n\nSo the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, but it doesn't matter what it is? Because we already reached the goal at the beginning of that turn.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning we have to specify the action for turn t1+H-1.\n\nHowever, after that action, we might move away. But the goal is only to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1 (at the beginning). So we have reached, and then we take an action that moves us away, but that's after we have already reached.\n\nSo it's acceptable.\n\nBut in the problem, the goal is to reach (0,9) and avoid collisions until we reach. So at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9) and then we take an action? But we are already at the goal, and then we move? \n\nThe problem does not specify that we have to stay. It only says \"reach\". So as long as at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9), we have reached.\n\nTherefore, in our BFS, we define the state at the beginning of turn T (with T = t1 + k) at position y, and we have taken k actions (at turns t1 to t1+k-1). We want to find the minimal k such that at the beginning of turn t1+k, we are at y=9.\n\nBut note: k = number of actions = H? \n\nWe took k actions to get to the state (t1+k, y). But the requirement is that we are at y=9 at turn t1+H-1. So we require t1+k = t1+H-1 -> k = H-1.\n\nTherefore, we are looking for k_min = minimal k such that we can be at y=9 at time t1+k, and then H = k+1.\n\nBut the sequence of actions has H actions, which is k+1.\n\nAlternatively, we can think: we want to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn T, and T = t1+H-1. The number of actions taken to get to that state is (T - t1) = H-1. Then H = T - t1 + 1.\n\nBut we want minimal H, so minimal T.\n\nHowever, we cannot necessarily get arbitrarily fast because of the waiting.\n\nBut in our case, we can compute the minimal T (>=13) such that we can be at y=9 at the beginning of turn T, and then H = T - 13 + 1.\n\nBut we are constrained by the moves: we need at least 9 up moves.\n\nWe can do BFS by time T (starting at T=13) and state y.\n\nWe start: T=13, y=0.\n\nThen we consider T from 13 upwards.\n\nAt each time T, we have a set of y we can be at.\n\nFrom a state (T, y), we came from an action at T-1: from y_prev, and we did an action a at T-1 that led to y = y_prev + Delta.\n\nBut for the next state: at T, we are at y. Then we take an action a at T that leads to y_next = y + Delta at T+1.\n\nBut we want to reach y=9 at time T.\n\nSo we can do dynamic programming: let dp[T][y] = whether we can be at y at the beginning of turn T.\n\nStart: dp[13][0] = true.\n\nThen for T from 13 to ... until we get dp[T][9]=true for some T.\n\nThen H = T - 13 + 1.\n\nHow to update? \n  To be at y at time T, we must have been at y_prev at time T-1, and taken an action a at T-1 such that:\n      y = y_prev + Delta, \n      and the state at T-1: we were at y_prev at T-1, and then we took an action. But note: at T-1, if we were on a freeway (y_prev in [1,8]), then we require that freeway y_prev was not dangerous at time T-1.\n\nBut also, we require that the move is valid: y_prev + Delta in [0,9].\n\nSo:\n  For T from 14 to ...:\n      for y in [0,9]:\n          for each action a in {U,D,S}:\n              y_prev = y - Delta, where \n                  if a=U: Delta=+1 -> y_prev = y-1\n                  if a=D: Delta=-1 -> y_prev = y+1\n                  if a=S: Delta=0 -> y_prev = y\n              Then we require that y_prev is in [0,9].\n              And if y_prev is in [1,8] (a freeway) and time T-1 is dangerous for freeway y_prev, then we skip.\n              Otherwise, if dp[T-1][y_prev] is true, then dp[T][y]=true and record the action.\n\nBut note: the action we record at T-1 is a.\n\nWe want the sequence of actions from T=13 to T=H-1? \n\nActually, the actions are taken at turns 13,14,...,T-1 (because at turn T-1 we take the last action that gets us to y at turn T).\n\nBut we want to be at y=9 at turn T. Then the actions are taken at turns 13 to T-1 (which is T-13 actions). Then H = T - 13? But the problem says H is the number of turns, and the sequence is from t1 to t1+H-1. And we are at turn t1+H-1 = 13+H-1 = T? Then 13+H-1 = T -> H = T - 12.\n\nAlternatively, if we are at y=9 at turn T, then we have taken actions at turns 13,14,...,T-1: that's (T-1 - 13 + 1) = T-13 actions. But the problem requires H actions? And then we are at turn t1+H-1 = 13+H-1. So we require 13+H-1 = T? Then H = T - 12.\n\nBut the number of actions we took is T-13, which should be H? Then T-13 = H, and also 13+H-1 = T -> 13+H-1 = 13 + (T-13) -1 = T-1 -> not T.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nLet me redefine: \n  We are at turn T (beginning) at y.\n  We take an action a_T at turn T, which updates to y_{T+1} = y + Delta.\n\nWe want to be at y=9 at turn T_reach.\n\nThe actions we take are at turns: 13,14,...,T_reach-1. Why T_reach-1? Because at turn T_reach-1, we take an action that updates to y_{T_reach}=9.\n\nThen the number of actions is (T_reach-1 - 13 + 1) = T_reach - 13.\n\nThen the last turn we act is T_reach-1, and we are at y=9 at turn T_reach.\n\nBut the problem requires that we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo we set: t1+H-1 = T_reach -> 13+H-1 = T_reach -> H = T_reach - 12.\n\nAnd the number of actions is H = T_reach - 12.\n\nBut the actions are from turn 13 to turn T_reach-1, which is T_reach-13 turns, and T_reach-13 = (T_reach-12) - 1 = H-1? That doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, if we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn T_reach, then the last action was taken at turn T_reach-1. The actions are taken at turns: 13,14,...,T_reach-1: that's (T_reach-1) - 13 + 1 = T_reach - 13 actions.\n\nBut the problem says the sequence has H actions. So H = T_reach - 13.\n\nAnd we are at turn t1+H-1 = 13 + (T_reach-13) - 1 = T_reach -1.\n\nBut we are at y=9 at turn T_reach, not at turn T_reach-1.\n\nThis is not matching.\n\nI think the problem means: we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1 (H actions) and then at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nBut then the last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, which updates to y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Delta_{t1+H-1}. \n\nSo to be at y_{t1+H-1}=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we must have been updated to that state by the action at turn t1+H-2.\n\nTherefore, the action at turn t1+H-1 is taken when we are already at y=9, and then we move to y_{t1+H} = 9 + Delta.\n\nBut the problem only requires to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, not to stay. So it's acceptable.\n\nIn our BFS, we then want to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn T, and then we will take an action at turn T (which is the last action in the sequence) even though we are already at the goal.\n\nSo the number of actions is the number of turns from 13 to T (inclusive) -> actions at turns 13,14,...,T: that's T - 12 actions? Because 13 to T: (T-13+1) = T-12 actions.\n\nThen H = number of actions = T-12.\n\nAnd the turn we are at y=9 is T, which is exactly t1+H-1 = 13 + (T-12) - 1 = T -> yes.\n\nSo: H = T - 12, where T is the turn at which we are at y=9.\n\nWe want minimal H, so minimal T.\n\nWe do BFS over T.\n\nStart at T=13, y=0.\n\nThen for each next turn, we update.\n\nWe will iterate T from 13 upwards until we hit y=9.\n\nAt each T, we consider the state (T,y) and then we consider the actions taken at T to go to T+1.\n\nBut to be at (T,y) and take action a, we go to (T+1, y+da).\n\nBut we also, when we are at (T,y), we must ensure that if y in [1,8] then T is not dangerous for freeway y.\n\nSo algorithm:\n\nLet's create an array or a set for each T.\n\nStart:\n  T=13: states: {0} (safe because y=0 not freeway)\n\nThen for T=13, we can take actions: a in {U, D, S} -> next states for T=14:\n  from y=0:\n      S: y_next=0\n      U: y_next=1\n      D: y_next=-1 (invalid)\n  so only y_next=0 or 1.\n\nBut then at T=14, we are at y=0 or y=1.\n\nBut at T=14, if we are at y=1, then freeway1 is dangerous at T=14 -> collision. So we cannot be at y=1 at T=14.\n\nTherefore, only y=0 is safe at T=14.\n\nSo T=14: states: {0}\n\nThen at T=14, we take actions from y=0:\n  S: next y=0\n  U: next y=1\n  D: invalid\n\nSo for T=15, we can be at y=0 or y=1.\n\nNow, at T=15: \n  if y=0: safe (not freeway)\n  if y=1: freeway1 at T=15 -> not dangerous (dangerous only at T=14) -> safe.\n\nSo both are safe.\n\nThen T=15: states: {0,1}\n\nThen from each state at T=15, we take actions:\n\nFrom y=0: can go to y=0 (S), y=1 (U)\nFrom y=1: can go to y=0 (D), y=1 (S), y=2 (U)\n\nSo for T=16, we can have: \n  from 0: 0,1\n  from 1: 0,1,2\n  so states: {0,1,2}\n\nAnd at T=16, all freeways are safe (because T>=15), so all are safe.\n\nWe continue until we get to y=9 at some T.\n\nWe want the minimal T.\n\nWe can do BFS layer by layer in T.\n\nWe'll use a set for each T.\n\nWe start with T13: {0}\nT14: {0}   [because from T13: only action S gives valid and safe state at T14]\nT15: {0,1} \nT16: {0,1,2} \nT17: {0,1,2,3} \nT18: {0,1,2,3,4} \nT19: {0,1,2,3,4,5} \nT20: {0,1,2,3,4,5,6} \nT21: {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7} \nT22: {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8} \nT23: from states at T22: \n   from y=8: U -> 9\n   from y=7: U->8, D->6, S->7\n   ... so we will get 9.\n\nSo at T23, we have y=9.\n\nTherefore, the minimal T to reach y=9 is 23.\n\nThen H = T - 12 = 23 - 12 = 11.\n\nBut is there a faster way? \n\nWe had to wait at T13: we did S to avoid going to y=1 at T14 (which is dangerous). Then at T14 we were at 0. Then at T14 we did U to go to y=1 at T15. Then we did U every turn from T15 to T22: \n\n  T15: y=1\n  T16: y=2\n  ...\n  T22: y=8\n  T23: y=9\n\nSo actions:\n\n  T13: S\n  T14: U\n  T15: U\n  T16: U\n  T17: U\n  T18: U\n  T19: U\n  T20: U\n  T21: U\n  T22: U   -> then at T23: y=9\n\nThat's 10 actions? But we said H=11? \n\nLet me count the actions: \n  T13, T14, T15, T16, T17, T18, T19, T20, T21, T22: that's 10 actions.\n\nThen according to our earlier formula: H = number of actions = 10.\nThen we are at turn t1+H-1 = 13+10-1 = 22. \nBut at turn 22, we are at y=8 (because at the beginning of turn 22, we are at y=8), then we take action U at turn 22, and then at turn 23 we are at y=9. But the requirement is to be at y=9 at turn t1+H-1=22. But at turn 22 we are at y=8, not 9.\n\nContradiction.\n\nTherefore, we must be at y=9 at the beginning of turn 22.\n\nHow can we achieve that? \n\nWe need to get to y=9 by turn 22.\n\nIn our BFS, we reached y=9 at turn 23. How to get at turn 22?\n\nWe would need to be at y=8 at turn 21, and then take U at turn 21 to be at y=9 at turn 22.\n\nBut at turn 21, can we be at y=8? \n\nFrom earlier, at turn 21, we can be at y=8 if we went up as fast as possible without waiting.\n\nBut we had to wait at the first step: so we did:\n\n  T13: we did S -> at T14: y=0.\n  T14: U -> T15: y=1.\n  T15: U -> T16: y=2.\n  T16: U -> T17: y=3.\n  T17: U -> T18: y=4.\n  T18: U -> T19: y=5.\n  T19: U -> T20: y=6.\n  T20: U -> T21: y=7.\n  T21: U -> T22: y=8.\n\nThen at T22: we are at y=8. We take U at T22 to get to y=9 at T23.\n\nSo at turn 22, we are at y=8, not 9.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn 22, we must be at y=8 at turn 21 and take U at turn 21.\n\nBut can we be at y=8 at turn 21? \n\nLet's see the earliest we can be at y=8:\n\n  Minimal turns to go from 0 to 8: 8 up moves.\n\n  But we start at T13: \n      T13: action0: U -> T14: y=1 -> but T14 is dangerous for y=1 -> not allowed.\n      so we must do S at T13: then T14: y=0.\n      T14: action1: U -> T15: y=1 (safe)\n      T15: action2: U -> T16: y=2\n      T16: action3: U -> T17: y=3\n      T17: action4: U -> T18: y=4\n      T18: action5: U -> T19: y=5\n      T19: action6: U -> T20: y=6\n      T20: action7: U -> T21: y=7\n      T21: action8: U -> T22: y=8\n\n  Then at T22: y=8, and to get to y=9 at turn 22, we would have to be at y=8 at turn 21 and then do S? But then we stay at 8. Or do U at turn 21 to get to 9 at turn 22.\n\n  But at turn 21, we were at y=7 (at the beginning) and then we took U to get to 8 at turn 22? \n\n  I'm confused.\n\n  Let me clarify the timeline:\n\n  Turn T: \n      - We start at y (at the beginning of turn T).\n      - We take action a.\n      - Then we update to y_next = y + Delta for the next turn.\n\n  So the state at the beginning of turn T is y_T.\n\n  To have y_{22}=9, we need to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn 22.\n\n  That means that at turn 21, we were at y_21, and we took an action a_21 such that y_21 + Delta = 9.\n\n  So if we took U, then y_21 = 8.\n\n  So we need to be at y=8 at the beginning of turn 21.\n\n  Can we be at y=8 at turn 21?\n\n  We have: \n      T13: y=0\n      T14: y=0 (after doing S at T13)\n      T15: y=1 (after U at T14)\n      T16: y=2 (U at T15)\n      T17: y=3 (U at T16)\n      T18: y=4 (U at T17)\n      T19: y=5 (U at T18)\n      T20: y=6 (U at T19)\n      T21: y=7 (U at T20)\n\n  So at T21, we are at y=7. To get to y=8 at T21, we would have needed to be at y=7 at T20 and then take U at T20? But at T20 we were at y=6 (from T19: U -> T20: y=7? no, at T20 we are at y=6).\n\n  We need to be at y=8 at the beginning of turn 21, so we need:\n\n      y_21 = 8.\n\n  How many up moves from y=0 to 8? 8 up moves.\n\n  We start at T13: y=0.\n  The soonest we can do the 8 up moves: \n        T13: U -> then at T14: y=1 (but dangerous) -> not allowed.\n        so we cannot do that.\n\n  Then we do:\n        T13: S -> T14: y=0.\n        T14: U -> T15: y=1.\n        T15: U -> T16: y=2.\n        ...\n        T21: y=7 (after 7 up moves: at T14,15,...,20: 7 actions of U)\n\n  So at T21: y=7.\n\n  Then at T21: we take U -> then at T22: y=8.\n\n  So we cannot be at y=8 until T22.\n\n  Therefore, the earliest to be at y=9 is T23.\n\n  So H = T - 12 = 23 - 12 = 11.\n\n  But then the actions are for turns 13 to 13+H-1 = 13+11-1 = 23.\n\n  We need 11 actions.\n\n  The actions are:\n\n      T13: S\n      T14: U\n      T15: U\n      T16: U\n      T17: U\n      T18: U\n      T19: U\n      T20: U\n      T21: U\n      T22: U\n      T23: ? \n\n  But we are at y=9 at T23, so the last action should be at T22: U to get from y=8 to y=9 at T23.\n\n  So we don't need an action at T23.\n\n  The sequence of actions is from turn 13 to turn 13+H-1 = 13+11-1 = 23? But then the last action is at turn 23, which would update to T24.\n\n  This doesn't match.\n\n  Let me calculate H: \n      We are at y=9 at T23.\n      Then H = T23 - 12 = 11.\n      Then the actions are at turns 13 to 13+11-1 = 23.\n      So we take an action at turn 23? But then we would update to y_{24} = 9 + Delta.\n\n  But we don't care about after we reach.\n\n  However, the problem requires to be at y=9 at turn t1+H-1=13+11-1=23.\n\n  So at turn 23, we are at y=9 (at the beginning) and then we take an action at turn 23, which might move us away.\n\n  But the problem only requires to reach at turn 23, not to stay.\n\n  So it's acceptable.\n\n  Therefore, we take 11 actions: turns 13 to 23.\n\n  The actions are:\n\n      T13: S\n      T14: U\n      T15: U\n      T16: U\n      T17: U\n      T18: U\n      T19: U\n      T20: U\n      T21: U\n      T22: U\n      T23: (any, but we are already at y=9 at the beginning of turn 23, so we can choose S, for example)\n\n  But at turn 23, we are at y=9, and then we take an action, say S, and then we go to y=9 at turn 24? But we are done at turn 23.\n\n  However, the action at turn 23 is part of the sequence.\n\n  So the sequence has 11 actions.\n\n  But we only needed 10 moves (S at T13 and then 9 Us from T14 to T22) to get to y=9 at T23. Why 11 actions? Because we include an action at turn 23.\n\n  But we are already at the goal at turn 23, so we can take any action at turn 23.\n\n  So minimal H is 11.\n\n  But is there a way to do it in 10 actions?\n\n  If we could be at y=9 at turn 22, then H = 22-12 = 10.\n\n  How to be at y=9 at turn 22? We would need to be at y=8 at turn 21 and take U at turn 21.\n\n  To be at y=8 at turn 21: we need 8 up moves, but we start at turn 13 at y=0.\n\n  The earliest we can do an up move without collision is at turn 14 (U from 0 to 1 at turn 14 is dangerous -> not allowed). So the first up move that lands us at y=1 must be at turn 15 or later.\n\n  So we do:\n\n      turn 13: cannot do U (because then at turn 14 we are at y=1 and it's dangerous) -> so must do S.\n      turn 14: U -> turn 15: y=1 (safe)\n      then from turn 15 to turn 21: we have 7 turns: we can do 7 up moves, so at turn 22: y=1+7=8.\n\n  So at turn 22: y=8, not 9.\n\n  Therefore, we cannot be at y=9 until turn 23.\n\n  So minimal H is 11.\n\n  The actions:\n\n      T13: S\n      T14: U\n      T15: U\n      T16: U\n      T17: U\n      T18: U\n      T19: U\n      T20: U\n      T21: U\n      T22: U   -> this gets us to y=9 at turn 23? \n          Let me see: \n              T13: S -> at T14: y=0.\n              T14: U -> at T15: y=1.\n              T15: U -> T16: y=2.\n              T16: U -> T17: y=3.\n              T17: U -> T18: y=4.\n              T18: U -> T19: y=5.\n              T19: U -> T20: y=6.\n              T20: U -> T21: y=7.\n              T21: U -> T22: y=8.\n              T22: U -> T23: y=9.\n\n          But we are at y=9 at turn 23.\n\n          The actions are from T13 to T22: 10 actions? \n\n  But we need to be at y=9 at turn 13+H-1.\n\n  If H=10, then 13+10-1=22. But at turn 22, we are at y=8, not 9.\n\n  Therefore, we need to include the action at turn 23.\n\n  So we take an action at turn 23: say S or U or D. If we do S, then at turn 24 we are at y=9? But we are required to be at y=9 at turn 23.\n\n  How about we do at turn 22: not U but something else? \n\n  We are at turn 22: we are at y=8 (beginning). We take action U, then at turn 23 we are at y=9.\n\n  But we want to be at y=9 at turn 22? We would have to have taken the action at turn 21 that moved us to 9 at turn 22, so we would have been at y=8 at turn 21 and done U. But we were at y=7 at turn 21.\n\n  So it's not possible.\n\n  Therefore, the minimal H is 11, with the understanding that at turn 23 (which is 13+11-1=23) we are at y=9.\n\n  Then the actions are for turns 13 to 23.\n\n  We have:\n\n      T13: S\n      T14: U\n      T15: U\n      T16: U\n      T17: U\n      T18: U\n      T19: U\n      T20: U\n      T21: U\n      T22: U\n      T23: ? \n\n  But we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn 23, so we can choose any action for turn 23. Let's choose S.\n\n  So the sequence of actions: \n      a13 = S\n      a14 = U\n      a15 = U\n      a16 = U\n      a17 = U\n      a18 = U\n      a19 = U\n      a20 = U\n      a21 = U\n      a22 = U\n      a23 = S\n\n  But is turn 23 safe? We are at y=9 at the beginning of turn 23, then we take action S. Since y=9 is not a freeway, we are safe. Then we update to y=9 at turn 24, but we don't care.\n\n  Therefore, the answer.\n\n  But wait, is there a shorter path by going down initially? \n\n  For example, at T13: D is invalid. \n\n  Or at T14: after T13: S -> T14: y=0, then we could do D? but y=0-1=-1: invalid.\n\n  So we cannot.\n\n  Or at later turns, we could go down to avoid? But that would only slow down.\n\n  Therefore, minimal H is 11.\n\n  Now, output the actions.\n\n  The actions for turns: 13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23.\n\n  So:\n\n      Turn 13: S\n      Turn 14: U\n      Turn 15: U\n      Turn 16: U\n      Turn 17: U\n      Turn 18: U\n      Turn 19: U\n      Turn 20: U\n      Turn 21: U\n      Turn 22: U\n      Turn 23: S\n\nBut note: the action at turn 23 is not necessary for reaching, but the problem requires a sequence of H=11 actions.\n\nAlternatively, could we do without the last action? But the problem requires exactly H actions.\n\nSo we include it.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in 11 actions without the extra move? \n\nWe could possibly wait at a different step? But that would not reduce the number of actions.\n\nOr we could go up faster by not having to wait at the first step? But we cannot.\n\nAnother idea: could we go down at some point to avoid the danger at T14? But we are at y=0 initially, we cannot go down.\n\nOr later, could we skip the wait and go up at T13 by going to y=0 at T14? But we cannot: if we go up at T13, we land in y=1 at T14 which is dangerous.\n\nOr is there a freeway that is not dangerous at T14? \n\nFreeways 1,2,3,4,5 are dangerous at T14. Freeway 6,7,8: \n  Freeway6: safe at T14? \n  Freeway7: safe.\n  Freeway8: only dangerous at T13, safe at T14.\n\nSo if we could be on freeway 6,7, or 8 at T14, we are safe.\n\nBut to be on freeway 6 at T14, we would need to be at y=6 at the beginning of turn 14.\n\nWe start at y=0 at T13.\n\nTo get to y=6 at T14, we would need to do 6 up moves in one action? Impossible.\n\nThe only actions change y by at most 1.\n\nTherefore, we cannot jump to y=6 in one move.\n\nSo the only safe option at T14 is y=0.\n\nTherefore, the plan is as above.\n\nSo the minimal H is 11.\n\nOutput:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: S\nTurn 14: U\nTurn 15: U\nTurn 16: U\nTurn 17: U\nTurn 18: U\nTurn 19: U\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\nTurn 23: S\n}\n\nBut note: at turn 23, we are already at y=9, so we can choose any action. We choose S for simplicity.\n\nAlternatively, we could choose U or D, but D would go to y=8 at turn 24, which is not required, but the problem doesn't require to stay. And since we have to provide an action, we provide S.\n\nBut is it valid to choose D? It would move us down to y=8 at turn 24, but the only requirement is to be at (0,9) at turn 23, which we are. So any action is allowed for the last step.\n\nWe choose S.\n\nFinal answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 13\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) by ensuring the player is not on a dangerous freeway at a dangerous turn.\n\n- At turn 13, the player is at \\(y = 0\\). Moving up to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 14 would collide with cars on freeway 1 (dangerous at turn 14). Thus, the player stays at \\(y = 0\\) (action S).\n- At turn 14, the player moves up to \\(y = 1\\). Freeway 1 is dangerous at turn 14, but the player arrives at \\(y = 1\\) at turn 15, which is safe (freeway 1 is only dangerous at turn 14).\n- From turn 15 to turn 22, the player moves up each turn, reaching \\(y = 8\\) at turn 23. All freeways are safe for turns 15 and beyond, as the only dangerous turns are 13 (freeway 8) and 14 (freeways 1–5).\n- At turn 23, the player is at \\(y = 9\\) at the beginning of the turn. Any action can be taken (e.g., stay for simplicity), as the goal is reached.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n- Turn 13: S (stay at \\(y = 0\\))\n- Turn 14: U (move to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 15)\n- Turn 15: U (move to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 16)\n- Turn 16: U (move to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 17)\n- Turn 17: U (move to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 18)\n- Turn 18: U (move to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 19)\n- Turn 19: U (move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 20)\n- Turn 20: U (move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 21)\n- Turn 21: U (move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 22)\n- Turn 22: U (move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 23)\n- Turn 23: S (stay at \\(y = 9\\), but any action is valid as the goal is reached at turn 23)\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 23 (\\(t_1 + H - 1 = 13 + 11 - 1 = 23\\)) with minimal actions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 13: S \\\\\nTurn 14: U \\\\\nTurn 15: U \\\\\nTurn 16: U \\\\\nTurn 17: U \\\\\nTurn 18: U \\\\\nTurn 19: U \\\\\nTurn 20: U \\\\\nTurn 21: U \\\\\nTurn 22: U \\\\\nTurn 23: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,1) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 15. I have to output a sequence of actions starting from turn 15.\n\nFirst, let's understand the car movements. For each freeway, there are cars with their positions and speeds. The cars move left or right, and I need to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at position 0 at that turn.\n\nThe collision condition is: at turn T, if I'm at position (0, y_T), and for the freeway y_T, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that exact turn.\n\nAlso, when I move from y to y+1 or y-1, at turn T, I'm on y_T, and I decide to move, so at turn T, I'm still on y_T for collision purposes, and at turn T+1, I'm on the new row.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with actions U, D, S meaning up, down, or stay, changing y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\nSince I start at y=1 and need to get to y=9, I need to go up, so actions will mostly be U, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars.\n\ny=9 is the goal, and it's not a freeway; freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, I think. y=0 is the bottom, y=9 is the top.\n\nThe grid is y=0 to 9, freeways y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\nAt y=0 and y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nI start at (0,1), which is on freeway y=1.\n\nI need to minimize H, the number of turns.\n\nFirst, let's list all the cars and their positions at turn t_1=15.\n\nFor each car, I have head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nDirection left means moving left, so position decreases; right means moving right, position increases.\n\nThe span: for left-moving, span is [h, τ] with h > τ? Let's see the notation.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, h and τ are decreasing.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: [τ, h] → [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the state, for each car, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nFor left-moving cars, head and tail: since it's moving left, at t_1, head is at h, tail at τ, with h > τ I assume, because as it moves left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, head and tail: probably τ is the left end, h is the right end? Let's see the notation.\n\nIn the car state:\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (-60, -25, left, 36)\n\nDirection left, so head and tail: (-60, -25), and left-moving, so at t_1, head is at -60, tail at -25? But -60 < -25, so tail is greater, which is confusing.\n\nPerhaps head and tail are not ordered; we need to interpret based on direction.\n\nLook at the span definition.\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ], so it might be that h and τ are the endpoints, and for left-moving, h is the right end, τ is the left end? No.\n\nIn the update, for left-moving: [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so if h and τ are numbers, and it moves left, so if h > τ, then h decreases, τ decreases.\n\nBut in the example, freeway 1: h = -60, τ = -25, so h = -60, τ = -25, so h < τ, since -60 < -25.\n\nThen Span(t_1) = [h, τ] = [-60, -25], but usually we write intervals with min and max, so [min, max], but here [h, τ] with h=-60, τ=-25, so min=h, max=τ.\n\nThen as it moves left, both decrease, so at time T, [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT] = [-60 - sΔT, -25 - sΔT]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nIn the car state, for right-moving, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), but in the span, it's [τ, h] for the interval.\n\nFor freeway 3: (-36, -47, right, 12), but direction right, so for right-moving, the span should be [τ, h], but here it's listed as (head, tail), so in this case, for right-moving, head and tail: which is which?\n\nI think there's inconsistency in notation.\n\nLet's look at freeway 3: cars are (-36, -47, right, 12), (48, 37, right, 12), (12, 1, right, 12)\n\nFor the first one: (-36, -47, right, 12)\n\nDirection right, so span should be [τ, h] with τ and h such that τ < h.\n\nBut here, head = -36, tail = -47, and -47 < -36, so tail is min, head is max? But in the tuple it's (head, tail), so head might be the front when moving, tail the back.\n\nFor right-moving, if moving right, head is the right end, tail is the left end.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, head is the left end, tail is the right end? I'm confused.\n\nLet's read the car update carefully.\n\nIt says: for car k on freeway i, at turn t_1, head at h, tail at τ.\n\nThen for left-moving: span(t_1) = [h, τ]\n\nBut in the example, for freeway 1: left, h=-60, τ=-25, so [h,τ] = [-60, -25], which is from -60 to -25, so if moving left, head should be the left end, so at t_1, head at -60, tail at -25, so the car is from x=-60 to x=-25, with head at left, tail at right.\n\nThen as it moves left, both positions decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, it says: span(t_1) = [τ, h], and for freeway 3, first car: (-36, -47, right, 12), so head= -36, tail= -47, but span is [τ, h] = [-47, -36], so from -47 to -36, and since moving right, head at -36 (right end), tail at -47 (left end).\n\nIn the tuple, for right-moving, head is the right end, tail is the left end.\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving, head is the left end, tail is the right end.\n\nIn freeway 1: left, head=-60 (left end), tail=-25 (right end).\n\nFor freeway 3: right, first car head=-36, tail=-47, so head is right end? -36 > -47, so head at -36, tail at -47, so span [τ,h] = [-47, -36], moving right.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (48,37, right,12), head=48, tail=37, span [37,48], moving right.\n\nThird car: (12,1, right,12), head=12, tail=1, span [1,12], moving right.\n\nNow for freeway 4,5 same as 3? No, freeway 4 has same cars as 3? Let's see.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3: (-36,-47,right,12), (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12)\n\nSimilarly freeway 5 same.\n\nFreeway 6: (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7: same as 6? (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nFreeway 8: (-48,-59,right,6), (18,7,right,6)\n\nAnd freeway 1 and 2: both have (-60,-25,left,36)\n\nFreeway 2 same as 1.\n\nNow, I need to find for each freeway, when a car has 0 in its span at time T.\n\nSince I start at turn t_1=15, at position y=1.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nThe minimal H would be at least 8, if I go up every turn, but I need to avoid cars, so it might take more.\n\nFirst, let's find for each row, the times when it is occupied at x=0.\n\nFor a given freeway i, and car on it, we need the times T when 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at time T.\n\nFor each car, the span at time T is a function of T.\n\nSet t_1 = 15.\n\nFor a car, at time T, span is:\n\nIf left-moving: [h - s(T - t_1), τ - s(T - t_1)]\n\n0 in span means min <= 0 <= max.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving.\n\nSince the car moves continuously, but positions are discrete? The positions are integers, I think, since given as integers.\n\nx positions are integers, I assume.\n\nSo for each car, we can solve for T such that 0 is in the interval.\n\nAlso, since the car moves at speed s, the span shifts by s per turn.\n\nNow for each freeway, multiple cars, so we need the union over cars.\n\nThen for row i, it is occupied at T if for some car on i, 0 in span at T.\n\nThen I need that when I am on row y at turn T, it must not be occupied, meaning no car on that row at that time has 0 in span.\n\nNow, since I move step by step, I need to plan a path from y=1 to y=9, starting at turn 15.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0,+1, but y in 0 to 9, so at y=0, I can only go up or stay, not down; similarly at y=9, only down or stay, but since I want to reach (0,9), once there I can stay.\n\nBut to minimize H, I should go up as much as possible.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on a row when it is occupied at that turn.\n\nAlso, note that when I move from y to y+1, at turn T, I am on y, so I care about row y at turn T, and after move, at T+1, I am on y+1, so I care about row y+1 at turn T+1.\n\nSimilarly for down.\n\nFor stay, I am on the same row at T and T+1.\n\nNow, let's compute for each row the occupied times.\n\nStart with freeway y=1.\n\nFreeway 1 has one car: (-60, -25, left, 36)\n\nLeft-moving, so span at time T: [h - s(T-15), τ - s(T-15)] with h=-60, τ=-25, s=36\n\nSo [ -60 - 36(T-15), -25 - 36(T-15) ]\n\n0 in span when min <= 0 <= max, but min is left end, max is right end.\n\nSince moving left, min = h - s(T-15) = -60 -36(T-15)\n\nMax = τ - s(T-15) = -25 -36(T-15)\n\nSo 0 in [min, max] iff min <= 0 <= max\n\nSo -60 -36(T-15) <= 0 <= -25 -36(T-15)\n\nFirst inequality: -60 -36(T-15) <= 0 => -36(T-15) <= 60 => multiply both sides by -1, reverse inequality: 36(T-15) >= -60\n\nSince 36>0, T-15 >= -60/36 = -5/3 ≈ -1.666, so T-15 >= -1.666, since T integer, T-15 >= -1, so T >= 14\n\n-60/36 = -10/6 = -5/3 ≈ -1.666, so 36(T-15) >= -60, divide both sides by 36: T-15 >= -60/36 = -5/3 = -1.666, so since T integer, T-15 >= -1, thus T >= 14\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -25 -36(T-15) => 25 + 36(T-15) <= 0? Let's see:\n\n0 <= -25 -36(T-15) => 25 + 36(T-15) <= 0? No:\n\n0 <= -25 -36(T-15) implies that -25 -36(T-15) >= 0, so -36(T-15) >= 25, then multiply by -1, reverse: 36(T-15) <= -25\n\nThen T-15 <= -25/36 ≈ -0.694, so T-15 <= -1 since integer, T <= 14\n\nFrom first: T >= 14\n\nFrom second: T <= 14\n\nSo T=14\n\nNow check:\n\nAt T=15, min = -60 -36(0) = -60, max = -25, so [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nAt T=14, min = -60 -36(-1) = -60 +36 = -24, max = -25 +36 = 11? T-15 = 14-15 = -1\n\nmin = -60 -36(-1) = -60 +36 = -24\n\nmax = -25 -36(-1) = -25 +36 = 11\n\nSo span at T=14: [-24, 11], and 0 is between -24 and 11, yes.\n\nAt T=15: min=-60, max=-25, 0 not in.\n\nAt T=16: min = -60 -36(1) = -96, max=-25-36=-61, both negative, 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=14, row y=1 is occupied.\n\nBut we are at turn t_1=15, and we are on y=1 at turn 15.\n\nAt turn 15, on y=1, is it occupied? At T=15, span is [-60,-25], 0 not in, so not occupied, so safe to be here at turn 15.\n\nBut the occupation was at T=14, which is before, so at turn 15, it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, for future turns, since no other T, so row y=1 is only occupied at T=14, so for T>14 or T<14 except 14, it is free.\n\nT=14 occupied, T=15 free, T=16 free, etc.\n\nNow freeway y=2: same as y=1, car (-60,-25,left,36), so same thing, occupied only at T=14.\n\nSo at turn 15, y=2 is free.\n\nBut we start at y=1.\n\nNow freeway y=3: has three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-36,-47,right,12)\n\nDirection right, span at T: [τ + s(T-15), h + s(T-15)] with τ=-47, h=-36, s=12\n\nSpan: [τ + s(T-15), h + s(T-15)] = [-47 + 12(T-15), -36 + 12(T-15)]\n\n0 in span iff min <= 0 <= max\n\nmin = -47 +12(T-15), max = -36 +12(T-15)\n\nSo -47 +12(T-15) <= 0 <= -36 +12(T-15)\n\nFirst: -47 +12(ΔT) <= 0 where ΔT = T-15\n\n12ΔT <= 47, ΔT <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916, so ΔT <= 3 since integer, T <= 18\n\nSecond: 0 <= -36 +12ΔT => 36 <= 12ΔT => 12ΔT >= 36, ΔT >= 3\n\nSo ΔT >=3 and ΔT <=3, so ΔT=3, T=18\n\nAt T=18, min = -47 +12(3) = -47+36= -11, max= -36+36=0, so [-11,0], 0 is included.\n\nNow second car on y=3: (48,37,right,12) head=48, tail=37, direction right.\n\nSpan: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [37 +12ΔT, 48 +12ΔT]\n\n0 in span: 37+12ΔT <= 0 <= 48+12ΔT\n\nBut 37+12ΔT >=37 >0, so min >0, so 0 <= min is false, so never 0 in span, since both ends positive for all T.\n\nSimilarly, third car: (12,1,right,12) head=12, tail=1, span [1 +12ΔT, 12+12ΔT] all positive, min >=1 >0, so never 0.\n\nSo only first car on y=3 causes occupation at T=18.\n\nThus y=3 occupied only at T=18.\n\nSimilarly, freeway y=4: same cars as y=3, so also occupied only at T=18.\n\nFreeway y=5: same, occupied only at T=18.\n\nNow freeway y=6: one car (-48,-59,right,6)\n\nHead=-48, tail=-59? Tail=-59, head=-48.\n\nDirection right, so span [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-59 +6ΔT, -48 +6ΔT]\n\n0 in span: -59 +6ΔT <= 0 <= -48 +6ΔT\n\nFirst: -59 +6ΔT <= 0 => 6ΔT <= 59, ΔT <= 59/6 ≈9.833, ΔT <=9\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 +6ΔT => 48 <=6ΔT => 6ΔT >=48, ΔT >=8\n\nSo ΔT >=8 and ΔT <=9\n\nFor ΔT=8: min = -59 +48 = -11, max= -48+48=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nΔT=9: min= -59+54= -5, max= -48+54=6, [ -5,6], 0 included.\n\nSo occupied at T=15+8=23 and T=15+9=24.\n\nT=23 and T=24.\n\nNow freeway y=7: same car as y=6, (-48,-59,right,6), so occupied at same times, T=23,24.\n\nNow freeway y=8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48,-59,right,6) same as above, so occupied at T=23,24.\n\nSecond car: (18,7,right,6) head=18, tail=7, direction right.\n\nSpan: [7 +6ΔT, 18+6ΔT]\n\n0 in span: 7+6ΔT <=0 <=18+6ΔT\n\nBut 7+6ΔT >=7>0, so min>0, never 0 in span.\n\nSo only first car matters, so y=8 occupied at T=23 and 24.\n\nNow, summarize the occupied times for each row:\n\ny=1: occupied at T=14 only\n\ny=2: occupied at T=14 only\n\ny=3: occupied at T=18 only\n\ny=4: occupied at T=18 only\n\ny=5: occupied at T=18 only\n\ny=6: occupied at T=23,24\n\ny=7: occupied at T=23,24\n\ny=8: occupied at T=23,24\n\nNow, at turn t_1=15, we are at y=1, which is free at T=15.\n\nWe need to reach y=9, which is always free.\n\nThe minimal number of turns: we need to increase y from 1 to 9, so at least 8 steps up, but we might need to wait or go down to avoid occupied rows at certain times.\n\nSince we can only change by ±1 or 0 each turn, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nWe start at turn 15, y=1.\n\nWe need to be on row y at turn T, such that when we are on it, it is not occupied at that turn.\n\nAlso, since we start at y=1, turn 15, and y=1 is free at 15.\n\nNow, the obstacles are at specific times.\n\nTo minimize H, we should go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on rows 3,4,5 at T=18, and rows 6,7,8 at T=23,24.\n\nT=18 and T=23,24.\n\nNow, let's see the timeline.\n\nTurn T: actions from T=15 onwards.\n\nAt turn T, we are at position y_T, and we choose action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, so after H-1 actions, we are at turn t_1 + (H-1) = 15 + (H-1), and y=9.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1, I think t starting from t_1.\n\nIn the output, it says {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}, so actions at turns t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H-1.\n\nAnd at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at y=9.\n\nSince we start at turn t_1 with y_{t_1}, after first action at t_1, we go to y_{t_1+1}, and so on, up to y_{t_1 + H -1} after H-1 actions.\n\nAt turn T, before action, we are at y_T, then we choose a_T, then move to y_{T+1}.\n\nBut for collision, at turn T, we are at y_T, and we are on that row at that turn, so collision depends on y_T and T.\n\nThen we choose action based on that.\n\nNow, we need to be at y=9 at some turn, and we can stay there or whatever.\n\nTo minimize H, we should reach as soon as possible.\n\nIdeal: go up every turn, from y=1 to y=9 in 8 turns: at turn 15, y=1; after U, turn 16, y=2; ... turn 23, y=9.\n\nLet's see the turns:\n\nAt turn T, y_T:\n\nT=15: y=1\n\nAfter a_{15}, y_{16} = y_{15} + Δy\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 15: at y=1\n\nAfter action a_{15}, go to y_{16}\n\nTurn 16: at y_{16}, and so on.\n\nIf we go up every turn:\n\nStart turn 15: y=1\n\na_{15}=U, then y_{16}=2\n\nTurn 16: y=2, a_{16}=U, y_{17}=3\n\nTurn 17: y=3, a_{17}=U, y_{18}=4\n\nTurn 18: y=4, a_{18}=U, y_{19}=5\n\nTurn 19: y=5, a_{19}=U, y_{20}=6\n\nTurn 20: y=6, a_{20}=U, y_{21}=7\n\nTurn 21: y=7, a_{21}=U, y_{22}=8\n\nTurn 22: y=8, a_{22}=U, y_{23}=9\n\nAt turn 23, we are at y=9.\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt turn 15, y=1, not occupied (only at 14)\n\nTurn 16, y=2, not occupied (only at 14)\n\nTurn 17, y=3, is it occupied? y=3 occupied at T=18, not at 17.\n\nTurn 18, y=4, but y=4 occupied at T=18? Yes, y=4 is occupied at T=18.\n\nProblem: at turn 18, if we are on y=4, and it is occupied.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 18, we are at y=4.\n\nBut y=4 is occupied at T=18, so collision.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 and y=5 also occupied at T=18.\n\nIn this path, at turn 18, we are on y=4, which is occupied.\n\nWe need to avoid being on rows 3,4,5 at turn 18.\n\nSimilarly, later, rows 6,7,8 occupied at T=23,24.\n\nIn this sequence, we reach y=9 at turn 23, and at turn 23, y=8? Let's see:\n\nTurn 22: y=8, then after U, y_{23}=9\n\nAt turn 23, we are at y=9, which is not a freeway, so no car, safe.\n\nBut at turn 23, if we were on y=8, it would be occupied, but we are at y=9.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAt turn 22: we are at y=8\n\nThen we take action U, so at turn 23, we are at y=9.\n\nNow, at turn 22, we are at y=8, and y=8 is occupied at T=23 and 24? T=23 and 24.\n\nBut at turn 22, what is the time? T=22.\n\ny=8 occupied at T=23 and 24, not at 22.\n\nSo at turn 22, y=8 is free? y=8 occupied at T=23,24, so at T=22, it should be free.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 23, we are at y=9, not on freeway.\n\nSo in this sequence, the problem is only at turn 18, we are on y=4, which is occupied.\n\nWe need to not be on y=3,4,5 at turn 18.\n\nIn the direct path, we are on y=4 at turn 18.\n\nTo avoid, we could delay or advance the movement.\n\nFor example, we could stay at some row to avoid being there at T=18.\n\nSince T=18 is the critical point.\n\nWe start at turn 15, y=1.\n\nIf we go up immediately:\n\nAfter one up: turn 16, y=2\n\nAfter two: turn 17, y=3\n\nIf we are at y=3 at turn 17, we could stay or go up.\n\nBut if we go up at turn 17, we go to y=4 at turn 18, which is occupied.\n\nIf we stay at turn 17 on y=3, then at turn 17, y=3, which is not occupied (only at 18), then at turn 18, we are still on y=3, but y=3 occupied at T=18, so collision.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down, but y=2 at turn 18 might be free, but we need to go up eventually.\n\nPerhaps we can be on a different row at turn 18.\n\nFor example, at turn 18, if we are on y=2 or y=6, etc.\n\ny=2 is free at T=18, since only occupied at 14.\n\ny=6 is free at T=18, since occupied at 23,24.\n\nSimilarly, y=1, y=9, etc.\n\nSo we should not be on y=3,4,5 at turn 18.\n\nSimilarly, we should not be on y=6,7,8 at turn 23 or 24.\n\nNow, in the direct path to y=9 by turn 23, we have issue at turn 18.\n\nWe need to adjust.\n\nSince we have time before T=18, we can slow down or something.\n\nFor example, from turn 15, we start at y=1.\n\nWe can stay at y=1 for some turns, or go to y=0.\n\ny=0 is safe.\n\nBut going down might not help directly.\n\nWe need to be at a safe row at turn 18.\n\nSafe rows at turn 18: y=1,2,6,7,8? y=1,2 free; y=6,7,8 free at T=18; y=0 and y=9 also.\n\ny=7 and y=8 are free at T=18, since occupied only at 23,24.\n\nSimilarly y=6.\n\nNow, at turn 18, if we can be on y=2, for example, then after that go up.\n\nBut let's see the timing.\n\nWe start at turn 15, y=1.\n\nIf we go up to y=2 quickly, but we can stay.\n\nMinimal H: we need to reach y=9.\n\nThe critical times are T=18 and T=23,24.\n\nSince T=23,24 are later, we might avoid them by being at y=9 before or after.\n\nIn the direct path, we reach y=9 at turn 23, which is fine, since y=9 safe.\n\nBut at turn 23, if we are at y=9, no problem.\n\nThe issue is at turn 18.\n\nSo let's focus on turn 18.\n\nWe need that at turn 18, we are not on y=3,4,5.\n\nPossible safe positions at turn 18: y=0,1,2,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut we are at y=1 at turn 15, so we can reach y=2 or y=0 or stay at 1.\n\ny=6 is far, we might not reach by turn 18.\n\nTurn 15 to turn 18 is 3 turns.\n\nFrom y=1, in 3 turns, we can go up to y=4, but y=4 occupied at 18.\n\nOr stay: if we stay at y=1 for 3 turns: turn 15,16,17 at y=1, then at turn 18, y=1.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nBut y=1 at turn 18 is safe.\n\nThen we can go up.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nSimilarly, we could go to y=2 earlier.\n\nLet's list the turns.\n\nDenote the row at each turn.\n\nTurn T | y_T\n\nT=15: y=1 (start)\n\nNow, for T=18, y_18 must not be 3,4,5.\n\nSince we need to go up, being at lower row might delay reaching y=9.\n\nBut we can be at higher row if possible.\n\nFor example, can we be at y=6 at turn 18?\n\nFrom y=1 at turn 15 to y=6 at turn 18: difference 5, in 3 turns, we need to go up 5 steps, but each turn we can only change by 1, so impossible. Max we can reach is y=1 + 3 = y=4 at turn 18 if we go up each turn.\n\nMin y=1 if stay or go down.\n\nSo at turn 18, possible y: from 0 to 4.\n\ny=0,1,2,3,4.\n\nBut y=3 and y=4 occupied at T=18, so we must be at y=0,1, or 2 at turn 18.\n\nSimilarly, y=2 is safe.\n\nNow, from turn 15 to turn 18, we have 3 actions: at T=15,16,17, determining y_16, y_17, y_18.\n\ny_18 = y_15 + sum of Δy from t=15 to 17.\n\ny_15 =1\n\nAfter actions at 15,16,17, we have y_18.\n\nEach Δy in {-1,0,1}\n\nSo y_18 = 1 + Δy15 + Δy16 + Δy17\n\nAnd y_18 must be 0,1,2.\n\nAlso, at each turn, we must not be on occupied row, but for T=15,16,17, let's see if any occupation.\n\nT=15: y=1 free\n\nT=16: y=2 free (occupied only at 14)\n\nT=17: what rows are occupied at T=17? From above, only the occupations we have are at T=14,18,23,24. T=17 is free for all rows, I think.\n\ny=3,4,5 occupied only at 18, so at 17 free.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo turns 15,16,17 are all safe for any row, except that we need to avoid future issues, but for now, no occupation at T=15,16,17 for any row.\n\nT=15: y=1 free\n\nT=16: y=2 free\n\nT=17: say we are at some y, all free.\n\nThen at T=18, we need to be at y=0,1,2.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 quickly, we should be as high as possible at turn 18, so y=2.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nBut we need to consider later obstacles.\n\nFirst, let's set y_18=2.\n\nHow to achieve that.\n\nFrom y_15=1, to have y_18=2.\n\nWe need to go up one net in three turns.\n\nFor example, we can:\n\n- Go up at one turn, stay or down at others.\n\nBut since we want to be high, go up once and stay twice.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt turn 15: since at y=1, we can go up to y=2, or stay, or down to y=0.\n\nBut to have y_18=2, we can:\n\nOption: at T=15, action S: stay at y=1, so y_16=1\n\nT=16: S, y_17=1\n\nT=17: U, y_18=2\n\nOr T=15: U, y_16=2\n\nT=16: S, y_17=2\n\nT=17: S, y_18=2\n\nOr other combinations.\n\nNow, from turn 18, y=2, we need to go to y=9.\n\nWe have to avoid being on y=6,7,8 at T=23 or 24.\n\ny=6,7,8 occupied at T=23 and 24.\n\nNow, from turn 18 to when we reach y=9.\n\nThe number of steps: from y=2 to y=9, need 7 steps up.\n\nEach step takes one turn, so minimum 7 turns from turn 18.\n\nSo at turn 18 + k, we can be at y=2 + k, for k=0 to 7.\n\nAt turn 18 + k, y=2+k.\n\nWe need to avoid y=2+k being 6,7,8 when T=23 or 24.\n\ny=2+k at time T=18+k.\n\nSet T = 18 + t, where t=0 at turn 18.\n\nThen y_{18+t} = 2 + something, but depending on actions.\n\nIf we go up every turn from turn 18:\n\nTurn 18: y=2, action U, y_{19}=3\n\nTurn 19: y=3, action U, y_{20}=4\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 24: y=2 + (24-18) = 2+6=8? Let's list:\n\nTurn 18: y=2, after U, y_{19}=3\n\nTurn 19: y=3, U, y_{20}=4\n\nTurn 20: y=4, U, y_{21}=5\n\nTurn 21: y=5, U, y_{22}=6\n\nTurn 22: y=6, U, y_{23}=7\n\nTurn 23: y=7, U, y_{24}=8\n\nTurn 24: y=8, U, y_{25}=9\n\nAt turn 25, y=9.\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt turn 18: y=2, safe\n\nTurn 19: y=3, is it occupied? y=3 occupied only at T=18, not at 19, so safe\n\nTurn 20: y=4, not occupied\n\nTurn 21: y=5, not occupied\n\nTurn 22: y=6, not occupied (occupied at 23,24)\n\nTurn 23: y=7, but y=7 occupied at T=23, yes! Problem.\n\nAt turn 23, y=7, occupied.\n\nSimilarly, turn 24: y=8, occupied.\n\nAlso, at turn 23, if we were to go to y=8, but in this sequence, at turn 23, we are at y=7.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=6,7,8 at T=23 or 24.\n\nIn this path, at T=23, we are on y=7, occupied; T=24 on y=8, occupied.\n\nSo we need to adjust.\n\nNow, from turn 18, we are at y=2.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 without being on y=6,7,8 at T=23 or 24.\n\nT=23 and 24 are fixed times.\n\nThe time from turn 18 to turn 23 is 5 turns (18 to 19,20,21,22,23).\n\nIn 5 turns, we can go up to 5 steps.\n\nFrom y=2, in 5 steps, we can be at y=7 at turn 23, for example.\n\nBut y=7 occupied at T=23.\n\nSimilarly, if we go slower, we might be lower.\n\nWe can be at y=9 before T=23.\n\nT=23 is turn 23.\n\nTurn 18 to turn 23: 5 turns.\n\nFrom y=2 to y=9: 7 steps needed, so in 5 turns, we can go up at most 5, to y=7 at turn 23.\n\nBut y=7 occupied.\n\nIf we go faster, but we can only go one per turn, so maximum y=2+5=7 at turn 23.\n\ny=7 at T=23 occupied.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 24, if we are at y=8, occupied.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn 23, we need to reach y=9 at or before turn 23.\n\nBut from turn 18, y=2, to y=9, need 7 steps, so at turn 18+7=25, y=9.\n\nTurn 18: after 0 steps, y=2\n\nAfter 1 step, turn 19, y=3\n\n...\n\nAfter 7 steps, turn 25, y=9.\n\nSo we can be at y=9 at turn 25.\n\nAt turn 23, we are at y=5 if we go up every turn from 18.\n\nTurn 18: y=2\n\nTurn 19: y=3\n\nTurn 20: y=4\n\nTurn 21: y=5\n\nTurn 22: y=6\n\nTurn 23: y=7 → occupied\n\nIf we can be at y=5 or lower at turn 23.\n\ny=5 at turn 23 is safe, since occupied only at 18.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nAt turn 23, if we are at y=5, then we need to go to y=9, which takes 4 more turns, to turn 27.\n\nBut we can be higher earlier.\n\nSince y=6,7,8 occupied at T=23 and 24, we can be on them before or after.\n\nFor example, we can be on y=6 before T=23, or after T=24.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, turn 23 and 24 are critical.\n\nWe need to not be on rows 6,7,8 at T=23 and T=24.\n\nSo we can be on them at T=22, or T=25, etc., as long as not 23 or 24.\n\nNow, back to turn 18, we are at y=2.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nLet me define the turn from start: let τ = T - 15, so τ=0 at turn 15.\n\nThen at τ=0: y=1\n\nWe need to set y at τ=3 (turn 18) to 0,1,2.\n\nWe set to y=2.\n\nNow at τ=3, y=2\n\nThen from τ=3 to when.\n\nτ=8 is turn 23 (15+8=23), τ=9 is turn 24.\n\nAt τ=8 and τ=9, we must not be on y=6,7,8.\n\nNow, y as a function of τ.\n\nLet u(τ) be the action at time τ, Δy.\n\ny(τ) = y(0) + sum_{i=0}^{τ-1} Δy(i)\n\ny(0) =1\n\nAt τ=3, y(3)=2\n\nSince we start at τ=0, after τ actions, we are at turn 15+τ.\n\nPosition at turn 15+τ is y(τ).\n\ny(τ) = y(0) + sum_{k=0}^{τ-1} Δy(k)\n\nFor τ=0, y(0)=1\n\nAfter first action, at τ=1, y(1) = y(0) + Δy(0)\n\nGenerally, at time τ, after τ actions, we are at turn t=15+τ, position y(τ).\n\nAnd y(τ) = y(0) + sum_{k=0}^{τ-1} Δy(k)\n\nAt τ=3, turn 18, y(3) =2\n\ny(3) = 1 + Δy(0) + Δy(1) + Δy(2) =2, so Δy(0) + Δy(1) + Δy(2) =1\n\nSince each Δy in {-1,0,1}, so the sum is 1, meaning we have one +1 and two 0, or other combinations, but since we want to be high, probably one U and two S.\n\nNow, from τ=3, y=2, we need to reach y=9 at some τ.\n\ny(τ) = 2 + sum_{k=3}^{τ-1} Δy(k)  for τ >3\n\ny(τ) = y(3) + sum_{k=3}^{τ-1} Δy(k)\n\nWe need y(τ) =9 for some τ.\n\nAnd we need for all τ, at turn 15+τ, on row y(τ), it is not occupied at time 15+τ.\n\nOccupations: at τ=3 (turn 18), y(3) not 3,4,5, which we have y=2.\n\nAt τ=8 (turn 23), y(8) not 6,7,8\n\nAt τ=9 (turn 24), y(9) not 6,7,8\n\nNow, to minimize H, we need to minimize the time to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=9 at τ, with y(τ)=9.\n\ny(τ) = y(3) + sum_{k=3}^{τ-1} Δy(k) = 2 + S, where S is the net up from τ=3 to τ-1.\n\nNumber of actions from τ=3 to τ-1 is (τ-1) - 3 +1 = τ - 3 actions? Let's see.\n\nFrom τ=3 to τ, we have actions at k=3 to k=τ-1 for the sum.\n\ny(τ) = y(3) + sum_{k=3}^{τ-1} Δy(k)\n\nThe number of terms in the sum is (τ-1) - 3 + 1 = τ - 3\n\nEach Δy <=1, so y(τ) <= 2 + (τ-3)\n\nSimilarly, y(τ) >= 2 - (τ-3)\n\nBut we need y(τ)=9, so 2 + S =9, S=7, where S = sum_{k=3}^{τ-1} Δy(k) >=0, so S=7.\n\nNumber of actions from k=3 to k=τ-1 is M = τ - 3\n\nS = sum of M terms, each in {-1,0,1}, and S=7.\n\nSince we need to go up, probably all U, so S <= M, so M >=7.\n\nThus τ - 3 >=7, τ >=10.\n\nSo earliest at τ=10, y=9.\n\nτ=10, turn 15+10=25, y=9.\n\nNow, at τ=10, y=10? y(τ) at τ=10.\n\ny(10) = y(3) + sum_{k=3}^{9} Δy(k)\n\nNumber of terms: from k=3 to 9 inclusive, that's 7 terms: k=3,4,5,6,7,8,9\n\n7 actions.\n\nsum Δy from k=3 to 9, 7 terms.\n\nS=7, so all Δy=1, all U.\n\nThen y(10) = y(3) + 7 = 2 + 7 =9.\n\nTurn at τ=10: turn 15+10=25.\n\nNow, we need to check for collisions at other times, especially at τ=8 and τ=9.\n\nτ=8 is turn 23, τ=9 turn 24.\n\nAt τ=8, y(8) must not be 6,7,8.\n\nAt τ=9, y(9) must not be 6,7,8.\n\nNow, in this plan, we go up every turn from τ=3 onwards.\n\nSo let's list y(τ) for each τ.\n\nτ=3: y=2\n\nThen actions:\n\nAt τ=3 (turn 18), action U, then y(4) =3 (at turn 19)\n\nτ=4 (turn 19), action U, y(5)=4 (turn 20)\n\nτ=5 (turn 20), U, y(6)=5 (turn 21)\n\nτ=6 (turn 21), U, y(7)=6 (turn 22)\n\nτ=7 (turn 22), U, y(8)=7 (turn 23)\n\nτ=8 (turn 23), U, y(9)=8 (turn 24)\n\nτ=9 (turn 24), U, y(10)=9 (turn 25)\n\nNow, at τ=8, turn 23, y(8)=7, which is 7, and y=7 occupied at T=23, collision.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=9, turn 24, y(9)=8, occupied.\n\nSo we need to avoid this.\n\nWe need to be not on y=6,7,8 at τ=8 or τ=9.\n\nIn the sequence above, at τ=7, turn 22, y(7)=6\n\nAt τ=8, turn 23, y(8)=7\n\nAt τ=9, turn 24, y(9)=8\n\nAll problematic at the times.\n\nSince we must have all U to reach y=9 at τ=10, we cannot change the actions; we need to adjust the path or add delays.\n\nBut with all U, we are forced to be at y=6,7,8 at turns 22,23,24.\n\nTurns 22,23,24 correspond to τ=7,8,9.\n\nAt turn 22, τ=7, y=6, which is not occupied (since occupied at 23,24), so safe.\n\nAt turn 23, y=7, occupied; turn 24, y=8, occupied.\n\nSo only turn 23 and 24 are problems.\n\nTo avoid, we can be at a different row at those turns.\n\nFor example, at turn 23, if we are not on 7, but lower or higher.\n\nBut if we are at y=6 at turn 22, and we go up, we go to y=7 at turn 23.\n\nIf we stay at y=6 at turn 22, then at turn 23, we are still at y=6, which is occupied at T=23.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down to y=5, then at turn 23, y=5, safe, but then we are lower.\n\nThen we need to go up later, taking more time.\n\nWe can be at y=9 before turn 23.\n\nBut from y=2 at turn 18, to y=9, min at turn 25, as above.\n\nTurn 18 to turn 23 is 5 turns, we can be at y=2+5=7 at turn 23, but occupied.\n\ny=2+4=6 at turn 22, etc.\n\nTo reach y=9 before turn 23, impossible since turn 23 is only 5 turns after turn 18.\n\nTurn 18 to turn 23: 5 turns, from y=2 to y=7 max.\n\nSo cannot reach y=9 before turn 23.\n\nEarliest at turn 25.\n\nAt turn 23, we can be at y from 2 to 7.\n\nSimilarly at turn 24, from 2 to 8.\n\nWe need at turn 23, y not 6,7,8; at turn 24, y not 6,7,8.\n\nSince we are going up, y is increasing, so at turn 23, if y <=5, then at turn 24, y <=6, but we need y not 6,7,8 at turn 24, so if y<=5 at turn 23, then at turn 24 y<=6, which could be 6, occupied.\n\nTo avoid y=6 at turn 24, if at turn 23 y=5, then at turn 23 action U, to y=6 at turn 24, occupied.\n\nIf at turn 23 y=5, action S, y=5 at turn 24, safe, but then we are at y=5, need to go up later.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 23 y=4, action U, to y=5 at turn 24, safe.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9.\n\nLet's think of the position at turn 23.\n\nTurn 23 is τ=8.\n\ny(8) must not be 6,7,8.\n\nSimilarly, y(9) not 6,7,8.\n\nSince y is non-decreasing if we go up, but we can go down or stay.\n\nTo minimize time, we should go up except when forced.\n\nSo possible values at turn 23: y(8) <=5 or y(8) >=9, but y>=9 only if we reach earlier, but we can't, so y(8) <=5.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 24, y(9) must not be 6,7,8, so if y(8) <=5, then y(9) <=6.\n\nIf y(9)=6, occupied, so we need y(9) <=5 or y(9)>=9.\n\nBut y=9 possible only if we reach earlier, but we can't by turn 24, since from turn 18 y=2, to y=9 at turn 25 earliest.\n\nAt turn 24, y(9) <=8, so we need y(9) <=5 or y(9)>=9, but y(9)<=8, so only possibility is y(9) <=5.\n\nSimilarly, at turn 23, y(8) <=5.\n\nThen from turn 18 y=2, to have y(8) <=5, we need to go up at most 3 steps in 5 turns (from τ=3 to τ=8, actions at τ=3,4,5,6,7 for y at τ=8).\n\ny(8) = y(3) + sum_{k=3}^{7} Δy(k) = 2 + S_{3 to 7}\n\nS_{3 to 7} is sum of 5 terms (k=3,4,5,6,7), each in {-1,0,1}, and y(8) <=5, so 2 + S <=5, S <=3.\n\nSimilarly, y(8) >=2-5= -3, but not binding.\n\nThen at turn 24, y(9) = y(8) + Δy(8)\n\ny(9) must <=5, since if y(9)=6,7,8 occupied.\n\nBut y(9) = y(8) + Δy(8) <= y(8) +1\n\nSince y(8) <=5, y(9) <=6.\n\nIf y(9)=6, occupied, so we need y(9) <=5.\n\nThus y(8) + Δy(8) <=5.\n\nSince y(8) <=5, if y(8) <=4, then y(9) <=5 possible with U or S.\n\nIf y(8)=5, then y(9) <=5 only if Δy(8) <=0, so S or D.\n\nThen later we need to reach y=9.\n\nBut this will take more turns.\n\nFor example, set y(8) =5 at turn 23.\n\nThen y(9) must be <=5, so at turn 23, action S or D.\n\nIf S, y(9)=5 at turn 24.\n\nThen from turn 24, y=5, need to go to y=9, 4 steps, at turn 28.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn 23 y=5, action D, y=4 at turn 24, then need 5 steps to y=9, turn 29, worse.\n\nSo better to stay or go down only if necessary.\n\nBut to reach y=9 faster, we should be as high as possible at turn 23, but y(8) <=5.\n\nSo set y(8)=5.\n\nThen to have y(8)=5 from y(3)=2 in 5 actions (k=3 to7), S=3, so we need to go up 3 times in 5 turns.\n\nSimilarly, then at turn 23, y=5, action S, to y=5 at turn 24.\n\nThen from turn 24, go up every turn to y=9 at turn 28.\n\nBut we can reach earlier if we are higher before, but we are constrained at turn 23 and 24.\n\nAnother idea: since at turn 23 and 24, rows 6,7,8 are occupied, but we can be on row 9, but we can't reach by then.\n\nOr be on row 5 or below.\n\nBut row 5 is safe at those times.\n\nNow, back to the beginning, at turn 18, we are at y=2, but we could be at y=1 or 0 to have more flexibility.\n\nBut lower means slower to reach high.\n\nLet's accept that at turn 23 and 24, we are low, then go up.\n\nBut we have the earlier constraint at turn 18.\n\nFirst, from start to turn 18.\n\nAt turn 15, y=1.\n\nWe need y_18 =0,1, or 2.\n\nTo save time, set y_18=2.\n\nFor example, one way: at turn 15, action U, to y=2 at turn 16\n\nTurn 16, action S, to y=2 at turn 17\n\nTurn 17, action S, to y=2 at turn 18\n\nOr other sequences.\n\nNow, at turn 18, y=2.\n\nNow, from turn 18 to turn 23, 5 turns.\n\nWe need y_23 <=5.\n\ny_23 = y_18 + sum_{t=18}^{22} Δy_t\n\nActions at t=18,19,20,21,22 for y at t=23.\n\ny at turn T is before action.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T, then action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nSo at turn 23, y_23.\n\ny_23 = y_18 + Δy_18 + Δy_19 + Δy_20 + Δy_21 + Δy_22\n\n5 actions.\n\ny_18=2, so y_23 = 2 + S, where S is sum of 5 Δy, each in {-1,0,1}, and y_23 <=5, so S <=3.\n\nAlso, to be efficient, we can have S=3, so y_23=5.\n\nThen we need to go up 3 times in 5 turns.\n\nFor example, at some turns U, some S.\n\nNow, similarly, at turn 24, y_24 = y_23 + Δy_23\n\nMust have y_24 <=5, so if y_23=5, then Δy_23 <=0, so S or D.\n\nBetter to stay, so y_24=5.\n\nThen from turn 24, y=5, go up every turn to y=9 at turn 28.\n\nTurn 24: y=5, U, turn 25 y=6\n\nTurn 25: y=6, U, turn 26 y=7\n\nTurn 26: y=7, U, turn 27 y=8\n\nTurn 27: y=8, U, turn 28 y=9\n\nAt turn 28, y=9.\n\nBut at turn 25, y=6, is it occupied? y=6 occupied at T=23,24, not at 25, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 26 y=7, not occupied at 26.\n\nTurn 27 y=8, not occupied.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, we need to ensure that during the path, no other collisions.\n\nFor example, from turn 18 to turn 23, when we go from y=2 to y=5.\n\ny=3,4,5 are only occupied at T=18, which is past, so at later turns, they are free.\n\nSimilarly, y=6,7,8 occupied at 23,24, but we are not on them until turn 25, which is after.\n\nIn the sequence to y=5 at turn 23, we are on lower rows.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nNow, let's write the full sequence.\n\nFirst, from turn 15 to 18:\n\nTurn 15: at y=1, action U, go to y=2 at turn 16\n\nTurn 16: at y=2, action S, stay y=2 at turn 17\n\nTurn 17: at y=2, action S, stay y=2 at turn 18\n\nAt turn 18: y=2, safe.\n\nNow, from turn 18 to 23, need to go to y=5 with 3 ups in 5 turns.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt turn 18: y=2, action U, go to y=3 at turn 19\n\nTurn 19: y=3, action U, go to y=4 at turn 20\n\nTurn 20: y=4, action U, go to y=5 at turn 21\n\nNow at turn 21, y=5.\n\nBut we need to reach y=5 at turn 23, not necessarily earlier.\n\nWe can stay or something.\n\nBut to save time, we can be at y=5 earlier, then stay.\n\nAt turn 21, y=5, which is safe.\n\nThen we need to stay until turn 23 or something.\n\nBut at turn 23, we need y=5.\n\nFrom turn 21 to 23, we can stay.\n\nBut let's list.\n\nAfter turn 20: y=5 at turn 21.\n\nNow, we need y at turn 23 to be 5.\n\nAt turn 21: y=5, we can action S, to y=5 at turn 22\n\nTurn 22: y=5, action S, to y=5 at turn 23\n\nThen at turn 23: y=5, safe.\n\nThen at turn 23: y=5, action S (since we need y_24 <=5, and to have y_24=5, stay)\n\nAction S, go to y=5 at turn 24\n\nTurn 24: y=5, safe.\n\nThen from turn 24: action U, to y=6 at turn 25\n\nTurn 25: y=6, U, to y=7 at turn 26\n\nTurn 26: y=7, U, to y=8 at turn 27\n\nTurn 27: y=8, U, to y=9 at turn 28\n\nAt turn 28, y=9.\n\nNow, H: from turn 15 to turn 28, actions from turn 15 to turn 27? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence of actions: from turn 15 to turn 27, that's 13 actions? Turns: 15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27\n\nThat's 13 turns.\n\nAfter action at turn 27, we go to y=9 at turn 28.\n\nAt turn 28, we are at y=9, so we have reached.\n\nThe last action is at turn 27, and at turn 28 we are at y=9.\n\nSo H-1 = number of actions to reach turn when at y=9.\n\nAfter H-1 actions, we are at turn t_1 + (H-1) = 15 + (H-1), and y=9.\n\nHere, at turn 28, y=9, so 15 + (H-1) = 28, so H-1=13, H=14.\n\nActions from turn 15 to turn 27, 13 actions.\n\nBut we can optimize.\n\nIn the path to y=5 at turn 23, we reached y=5 at turn 21, then stayed two turns.\n\nWe could go slower to reach y=5 exactly at turn 23.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt turn 18: y=2, action S, stay y=2? But we need to go up to y=5.\n\nBetter to go up earlier.\n\nAt turn 18: U, to y=3 at 19\n\nTurn 19: S, to y=3 at 20? Let's not stay unnecessarily.\n\nSince we need only 3 ups in 5 turns, we can have two stays.\n\nBut to minimize time, we should go up as soon as possible, then stay.\n\nIn this case, since we have to be at y=5 at turn 23, going up earlier allows us to stay, but we still reach y=9 at turn 28.\n\nIf we go up later, we might reach y=5 later, but then y=9 later, so worse.\n\nFor example, if we do:\n\nTurn 18: S, y=2 to 19\n\nTurn 19: S, y=2 to 20\n\nTurn 20: U, y=3 to 21\n\nTurn 21: U, y=4 to 22\n\nTurn 22: U, y=5 to 23\n\nThen at turn 23, y=5.\n\nSame as before, but we reached y=5 at turn 23 directly, without staying.\n\nThen turn 23: S, to y=5 at 24\n\nTurn 24: S, to y=5 at 25? No, at turn 24 we need to go up.\n\nFrom turn 23: y=5, action S, to y=5 at turn 24\n\nTurn 24: y=5, action U, to y=6 at turn 25\n\nThen turn 25: U, to y=7 at 26\n\nTurn 26: U, to y=8 at 27\n\nTurn 27: U, to y=9 at 28\n\nSame as before.\n\nAt turn 24, after action U, to y=6 at turn 25.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 24, we are at y=5, action U, go to y=6 at turn 25.\n\nThen y=9 at turn 28.\n\nCan we reach earlier?\n\nFor example, at turn 23, if we could be higher, but we can't because of occupation.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 18, we are at y=2, but if we were at y=1 or 0, we could be lower at turn 23, but that might not help.\n\nPerhaps we can go down to y=0 to save time or something, but y=0 is safe, but going down then up takes more turns.\n\nFor example, at some point go to y=0, but I don't see benefit.\n\nPerhaps for the occupation at T=23,24, we can be on y=9 before, but impossible.\n\nOr after, but we need to wait.\n\nBut in this case, with H=14, we have a sequence.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can do with less H.\n\nMinimal H: since we need to go from y=1 to y=9, at least 8 actions if all U, but with obstacles, we need more.\n\nIn this case, we have delays.\n\nAt turn 18, we are at y=2 instead of y=4, so we lost 2 steps there.\n\nThen from y=2 to y=5 at turn 23, but in direct, at turn 23 we could be at y=7, but occupied.\n\nThen at turn 23 and 24, we stay or go down, losing more steps.\n\nIn our sequence, from turn 18 to 23, 5 turns to go from y=2 to y=5, net +3, so 2 stays.\n\nThen at turn 24, we are at y=5, then to y=9 in 4 turns, with 4 U.\n\nTotal turns from start: from turn 15 to 28, 13 actions, H=14.\n\nThe number of turns from turn 15 to turn 28 is 14 turns, but actions from 15 to 27.\n\nt_1 + H -1 = 28, so 15 + H -1 =28, H-1=13, H=14.\n\nPerhaps we can reduce the stays.\n\nFor example, at turn 18, instead of y=2, we can be at y=1 or 0.\n\nIf at turn 18, y=1, then from y=1 to, at turn 23, y<=5.\n\nFor example, y=1 at turn 18.\n\nThen to y=5 at turn 23, need +4 in 5 turns, so possible, y_23=5.\n\nThen same as before, y=5 at turn 23 and 24, then to y=9 at turn 28.\n\nBut we started lower, so from turn 15 to turn 18, if we are at y=1 instead of y=2, we lost one step.\n\nFor example, to have y_18=1: at turn 15, S, y=1 to 16; turn 16, S, y=1 to 17; turn 17, S, y=1 to 18.\n\nThen from turn 18 y=1, to turn 23 y=5, with 4 U and one S, for example.\n\nThen same end.\n\nWorse.\n\nIf at turn 18 y=0, even lower.\n\nSo y=2 at turn 18 is best.\n\nNow, from turn 18 to 23, we go to y=5 with 3 U in 5 turns, meaning 2 S.\n\nWe could have no S, but with D, but that would make y lower, worse.\n\nSo must have some S.\n\nBut we can place the S at points where we might have collision, but in this period, no occupations, so no issue.\n\nTo reach y=9 faster, if we can be higher at turn 24.\n\nAt turn 24, we need y<=5, so we cannot be higher.\n\nUnless we reach y=9 before turn 24, but impossible.\n\nSo turn 28 is earliest.\n\nBut let's check if we can be on y=6,7,8 at turn 22 or earlier.\n\nFor example, in the first part, if we go up faster to turn 18.\n\nBut at turn 18, we must be at y<=2, so we cannot be higher.\n\nFor example, if at turn 15, U to y=2\n\nTurn 16, U to y=3\n\nBut at turn 17, y=3, which is safe, but at turn 18, we need to not be on 3,4,5, so we must go down or stay to avoid.\n\nFor example, at turn 17, y=3, action D, to y=2 at turn 18.\n\nThen we are at y=2 at turn 18, same as before.\n\nBut we used a down action, which is inefficient.\n\nThen from there same.\n\nSo no gain.\n\nThus, the sequence I have should be minimal H=14.\n\nNow, let's write the actions.\n\nStart turn 15: at y=1, action U → to y=2\n\nTurn 16: at y=2, action S → to y=2\n\nTurn 17: at y=2, action S → to y=2\n\nTurn 18: at y=2, action U → to y=3\n\nTurn 19: at y=3, action U → to y=4\n\nTurn 20: at y=4, action U → to y=5\n\nTurn 21: at y=5, action S → to y=5\n\nTurn 22: at y=5, action S → to y=5\n\nTurn 23: at y=5, action S → to y=5\n\nTurn 24: at y=5, action U → to y=6\n\nTurn 25: at y=6, action U → to y=7\n\nTurn 26: at y=7, action U → to y=8\n\nTurn 27: at y=8, action U → to y=9\n\nAt turn 28, y=9.\n\nActions from turn 15 to 27, 13 actions.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 21,22,23 we have S, but at turn 23 we need to stay to keep y=5 for turn 24.\n\nIn turn 21, we are at y=5, we can go up, but if we go up at turn 21, to y=6 at turn 22.\n\nThen at turn 22, y=6, which is safe (not occupied).\n\nThen at turn 22, if we stay, y=6 at turn 23, but y=6 occupied at T=23, collision.\n\nIf we go up, to y=7 at turn 23, occupied.\n\nIf we go down, to y=5 at turn 23.\n\nThen at turn 23, y=5, safe.\n\nThen at turn 23, action, to y at turn 24.\n\nIf we go up to y=6 at turn 24, occupied.\n\nSo must stay or down.\n\nSay stay, y=5 at turn 24.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nBut we used an extra action: from turn 21 U to y=6 at 22, then D to y=5 at 23, then S to y=5 at 24.\n\nCompared to staying at 5 from 21 to 24.\n\nIn terms of reaching y=9, if we go to y=6 at turn 22, then back to 5, we are still at 5 at turn 24, same as staying, but used more actions, so worse for time.\n\nThus, staying is better.\n\nSo the sequence is fine.\n\nNow, to output the actions.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be the sequence from turn t_1.\n\nH=14, actions from turn 15 to turn 15+13-1? Let's see.\n\nThe actions: a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nt_1=15, H=14, so actions from 15 to 15+13=28? t_1 + (H-1) =15+13=28.\n\nAction at turn 28? But at turn 28, we are already at y=9, so no action needed.\n\nAfter action at turn 27, we are at y=9 at turn 28.\n\nSo the last action is at turn 27.\n\nActions at turns: 15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27\n\nThat's 13 actions, so H-1=13, H=14.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =15 +14 -1=28, but at turn 28, position is after action, but we define y_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nIn this case, at turn 28, y=9.\n\nAnd we took actions from turn 15 to 27.\n\nIn the sequence, action at turn T determines y_{T+1}.\n\nBut for collision, at each turn T, we are at y_T before action.\n\nIn the output, we need actions starting from turn 15.\n\nNow, for the sequence:\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: S\n\nTurn 17: S\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: S\n\nTurn 22: S\n\nTurn 23: S\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nAt turn 27, action U, from y=8 to y=9 at turn 28.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 20: U to y=5 at turn 21.\n\nThen turn 21: S, stay y=5 at turn 22\n\nTurn 22: S, stay y=5 at turn 23\n\nTurn 23: S, stay y=5 at turn 24\n\nTurn 24: U, to y=6 at turn 25\n\nBut at turn 24, we are at y=5, action U, go to y=6 at turn 25.\n\nThen turn 25: at y=6, U to y=7 at 26\n\n Etc.\n\nAt turn 24, after action, to y=6 at turn 25.\n\nBut turn 24 is T=24, which is occupied for rows 6,7,8, but at turn 24, we are at y=5, not on those rows, so safe.\n\nThen at turn 25, y=6, which is free.\n\nAll good.\n\nTo make it shorter, but I think 14 is minimal.\n\nAnother possibility: at turn 18, we are at y=2.\n\nThen if we go up immediately to y=5 by turn 21, as before.\n\nThen instead of staying, we could go to y=6 at turn 22, but then we need to go down to avoid turn 23.\n\nBut as before, inefficient.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 at turn 25 if we can avoid the occupation differently, but I don't see how.\n\nFor example, if at turn 23, we are at y=5, but if we could be at y=9, impossible.\n\nSo I think H=14 is the minimal.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we have multiple S, but necessary.\n\nNow, to output.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 3,4,5, there are multiple cars, but we considered only the one that causes occupation.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAlso, for y=8, there is another car, but it doesn't cause occupation.\n\nSo fine.\n\nNow, the answer format.\n\nSo actions:\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: S\n\nTurn 17: S\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: S\n\nTurn 22: S\n\nTurn 23: S\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nH=14, actions from t=15 to t=27.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =15+14-1=28, and at turn 28, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, we have 13 actions listed, but H=14 means the number of turns including start, but in the context, H is the minimal number such that we reach at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn the problem: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nSo for t from 0 to H-1, actions at t_1 + t.\n\nSo for H=14, t from 0 to 13, actions at 15+0=15 to 15+13=28.\n\nBut action at turn 28? But at turn 28, if we are at y=9, we don't need action, but the sequence includes actions until we reach.\n\nIn this case, at turn 27, we take action to go to y=9 at turn 28.\n\nIf at turn 28 we are at y=9, we can have no action, but the sequence should include actions until the last one before reaching.\n\nIn the definition, after H-1 actions, we are at turn t_1 + H -1 with y=9.\n\nIn this case, after 13 actions (t=0 to 12? let's index.\n\nSet t starting from 0.\n\nt=0: action at t_1 +0 =15\n\nt=1: at 16\n\n...\n\nt=12: at 27\n\nt=13: at 28? But H-1=13, so t from 0 to 12, actions at 15 to 27.\n\nThen at turn 28, position after last action.\n\nWith action at 27 U, from y=8 to y=9 at turn 28.\n\nSo turn 28: at y=9.\n\nAnd we have actions from 15 to 27.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn 28, no action needed, but it's not part of the action sequence.\n\nThe action sequence is only for turns when we take action.\n\nIn the output, it should be the actions from turn 15 to 27.\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's write.\n\nFirst, H=14.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 15: U\n\nTurn 16: S\n\nTurn 17: S\n\nTurn 18: U\n\nTurn 19: U\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: S\n\nTurn 22: S\n\nTurn 23: S\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 21,22,23: S, which is fine.\n\nTo confirm, let's list the position at each turn.\n\nTurn 15: start y=1, action U → y=2 at turn 16\n\nTurn 16: y=2, action S → y=2 at turn 17\n\nTurn 17: y=2, action S → y=2 at turn 18\n\nTurn 18: y=2, action U → y=3 at turn 19\n\nTurn 19: y=3, action U → y=4 at turn 20\n\nTurn 20: y=4, action U → y=5 at turn 21\n\nTurn 21: y=5, action S → y=5 at turn 22\n\nTurn 22: y=5, action S → y=5 at turn 23\n\nTurn 23: y=5, action S → y=5 at turn 24\n\nTurn 24: y=5, action U → y=6 at turn 25\n\nTurn 25: y=6, action U → y=7 at turn 26\n\nTurn 26: y=7, action U → y=8 at turn 27\n\nTurn 27: y=8, action U → y=9 at turn 28\n\nAt turn 28: y=9.\n\nCollision check:\n\nTurn 15: y=1, free\n\nTurn 16: y=2, free\n\nTurn 17: y=2, free\n\nTurn 18: y=2, free\n\nTurn 19: y=3, free (not 18)\n\nTurn 20: y=4, free\n\nTurn 21: y=5, free\n\nTurn 22: y=5, free\n\nTurn 23: y=5, free\n\nTurn 24: y=5, free\n\nTurn 25: y=6, free (occupied at 23,24, not 25)\n\nTurn 26: y=7, free\n\nTurn 27: y=8, free\n\nTurn 28: y=9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo this should be the minimal H.\n\nPerhaps we can reduce one stay, but I think not.\n\nSo H=14.\n\nNow for the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) is 14, with the sequence of actions starting from turn \\(t_1 = 15\\) as follows:\n\n- At turn 15, the player is at \\((0, 1)\\). Action \\(U\\) moves to \\((0, 2)\\) at turn 16.\n- At turn 16, action \\(S\\) stays at \\((0, 2)\\) for turn 17.\n- At turn 17, action \\(S\\) stays at \\((0, 2)\\) for turn 18.\n- At turn 18, action \\(U\\) moves to \\((0, 3)\\) at turn 19.\n- At turn 19, action \\(U\\) moves to \\((0, 4)\\) at turn 20.\n- At turn 20, action \\(U\\) moves to \\((0, 5)\\) at turn 21.\n- At turn 21, action \\(S\\) stays at \\((0, 5)\\) for turn 22.\n- At turn 22, action \\(S\\) stays at \\((0, 5)\\) for turn 23.\n- At turn 23, action \\(S\\) stays at \\((0, 5)\\) for turn 24.\n- At turn 24, action \\(U\\) moves to \\((0, 6)\\) at turn 25.\n- At turn 25, action \\(U\\) moves to \\((0, 7)\\) at turn 26.\n- At turn 26, action \\(U\\) moves to \\((0, 8)\\) at turn 27.\n- At turn 27, action \\(U\\) moves to \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 28.\n\nThis sequence avoids collisions:\n- Rows \\(y = 3, 4, 5\\) are occupied only at turn 18, so being on these rows at other turns (e.g., turns 19, 20, 21) is safe.\n- Rows \\(y = 6, 7, 8\\) are occupied at turns 23 and 24, so the player is on \\(y = 5\\) (safe) during these turns and moves to higher rows after turn 24.\n- \\(y = 1\\) and \\(y = 2\\) are occupied only at turn 14, so they are safe at turns 15–17.\n- \\(y = 0\\) and \\(y = 9\\) have no cars and are always safe.\n\nThe actions are executed from turn 15 to turn 27 (13 actions), and the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 28, which is turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 15 + 14 - 1 = 28\\).\n\n\\boxed{14}  \nTurn 15: U  \nTurn 16: S  \nTurn 17: S  \nTurn 18: U  \nTurn 19: U  \nTurn 20: U  \nTurn 21: S  \nTurn 22: S  \nTurn 23: S  \nTurn 24: U  \nTurn 25: U  \nTurn 26: U  \nTurn 27: U",

We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nPlayer movement:\n  U: y += 1\n  D: y -= 1\n  S: y remains\n\nCollision condition at turn T: \n  We are at some y_T (which is a freeway from 1 to 8) and at that turn T, the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0.\n\nImportant: When we move from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, we are only present on freeway y_T at turn T. So we check collision only for the freeway we are on at that turn.\n\nCar update:\n  For a car at turn t_1 (current turn 18) with head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s:\n    At turn T (>= t_1), the car's position is:\n        if left: [h - s*(T-t_1), tau - s*(T-t_1)]\n        if right: [tau + s*(T-t_1), h + s*(T-t_1)]\n\nWe are only concerned with whether the span on the freeway we are on at turn T contains 0.\n\nOur plan:\n  We need to go from y=0 to y=9. The minimal number of moves without any cars would be 9 moves (each U). But we have to avoid freeways when a car is at x=0.\n\nWe must not be on a freeway y (1..8) at a turn T when there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\nWe note that the player moves at the same time as the cars. So at turn T (starting from T=18), we choose an action that determines y_{T+1}. But note: at turn T, we are at y_T. So for collision, we care about the car on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nLet me denote:\n  T0 = 18 (current turn)\n\nAt T0=18, we are at (0,0). We are not on a freeway (since freeways are y=1..8) so no collision at T0.\n\nWe need to get to y=9. We can only change y by at most 1 per turn. So we must go through y=1,2,...,8 at some turns.\n\nWe are to find a sequence of actions (U, D, S) for turns T0, T0+1, ... until we reach y=9.\n\nWe want minimal H (number of turns) so that at turn T0+H-1 we are at y=9.\n\nNote: The first action we take is at turn T0 (18) and then we move to T0+1, etc.\n\nWe are at:\n  T0: y=0.\n\nAfter one action (at T0), we are at T0+1 and we have y1 = y0 + delta (which can be 0,1,-1).\n\nWe must avoid being on freeway k at any turn T (>= T0) if at that turn T, the car(s) on freeway k have a span that includes 0.\n\nWe are going to simulate the car positions for each freeway at each future turn.\n\nFirst, note that the cars are moving at constant speed. We are only concerned with when the car spans on a particular freeway cover x=0.\n\nFor each freeway k (1..8) and for each car on that freeway, we can compute the time intervals (in turns) during which the car covers x=0.\n\nBut note: multiple cars on the same freeway? Yes, for example freeway 3 has three cars. We have to avoid if any car on that freeway covers 0 at the turn we are on that freeway.\n\nSo for a freeway k, we need the set of turns T (>= T0) for which at least one car on k has 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway k the set of \"dangerous\" turns.\n\nBut note: the cars move continuously? Actually, the update is linear in integer turns. So we can compute for each car the interval of turns during which it covers 0.\n\nFor a car on freeway k at turn T0 (current) with head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s.\n\nCase 1: left-moving (d='left')\n   Span at turn T: [h - s*(T-T0), tau - s*(T-T0)]\n   We require 0 to be in [h - s*(T-T0), tau - s*(T-T0)].\n\n   Since the car moves left, and the span is [head, tail] at T0, but note: the head is the front? Actually, for left-moving, the head is the leftmost? The problem says:\n        Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> at T: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n\n   But note: h and tau are given. Since the car is moving left, the entire car is shifting left. The span at T0 is [h, tau] and then it moves left by s per turn.\n\n   We require:\n        h - s*(T-T0) <= 0 <= tau - s*(T-T0)\n\n   But note: for a left-moving car, the head is the leftmost? Actually, the problem says at T0: head is h and tail is tau. And then it moves left. So the head at T0 is at h, and then at T it is at h - s*(T-T0). The tail at T0 is at tau, and then at T it is at tau - s*(T-T0).\n\n   However, note that for a left-moving car, the head should be the leading part? But in the update, it subtracts the same s*(T-T0) from both. So the entire segment shifts left.\n\n   But the problem says: for left-moving, the span at T0 is [h, tau]. Then at T, it becomes [h - s*(T-T0), tau - s*(T-T0)]. \n\n   Important: we must note the order. Since it's moving left, we expect the head (front) to be at h at T0 and then move to h - s*(T-T0). But the tail (back) is at tau at T0 and then moves to tau - s*(T-T0). \n\n   However, the problem does not specify whether h < tau or h > tau? But the examples: for freeway 1: (48,83,left,36) -> at T0, the car is from 48 to 83? But that would be a positive length? Actually, 83>48, so the car is from 48 to 83. Then as it moves left, the entire segment moves left.\n\n   So for left-moving, the car occupies [h, tau] at T0 (with h<tau) and then at T, it occupies [h - s*(T-T0), tau - s*(T-T0)].\n\n   Therefore, we require:\n        h - s*(T-T0) <= 0 <= tau - s*(T-T0)\n\n   Rearranged:\n        h <= s*(T-T0) <= tau   ??? Let me check:\n\n        h - s*(T-T0) <= 0  => s*(T-T0) >= h\n        and 0 <= tau - s*(T-T0) => s*(T-T0) <= tau\n\n        So: T-T0 >= ceil(h/s) and T-T0 <= floor(tau/s)   ??? But note: h and tau are integers, s is integer, and T-T0 is integer.\n\n        Actually: \n          s*(T-T0) >= h   => T-T0 >= ceil(h/s)\n          s*(T-T0) <= tau => T-T0 <= floor(tau/s)\n\n   But note: if h is negative? Then the car is already to the left? Actually, at T0, the car is at [48,83] for freeway1, so h=48>0. But for freeway8, we have (0,-11,right,6) -> this is right-moving, so we'll handle separately.\n\n   However, for the left-moving car on freeway1: h=48, tau=83, s=36.\n\n        T-T0 must be in [ceil(48/36), floor(83/36)] = [ceil(1.333), floor(2.305)] = [2,2]. So only at T-T0=2? That is, at turn T0+2 = 20.\n\n        Check: at T0+2: \n            head: 48 - 36*2 = 48-72 = -24\n            tail: 83 - 36*2 = 83-72 = 11\n            So the car spans from -24 to 11. Then 0 is in [-24,11]? Yes.\n\n        But what about T-T0=1? \n            head: 48-36=12, tail:83-36=47 -> [12,47] -> 0 not in [12,47]. \n        T-T0=3: head:48-108=-60, tail:83-108=-25 -> [-60,-25] -> 0 not in.\n\n        So only at T=20.\n\n   Similarly, freeway2 has the same car: (48,83,left,36) -> same: dangerous only at T=20.\n\nNow for right-moving cars:\n\n   The update: [tau + s*(T-T0), h + s*(T-T0)]   [because at T0: the car is from tau to h? But the problem says: for right-moving, the span at T0 is [tau, h] and then becomes [tau + s*(T-T0), h + s*(T-T0)].\n\n   But note: the example freeway3: (48,37,right,12) -> wait, head=48, tail=37? But then the span at T0 is [37,48] (since [tau, h] = [37,48]). Then it moves right.\n\n   So for a right-moving car, we require:\n        tau + s*(T-T0) <= 0 <= h + s*(T-T0)\n\n   Rearranged:\n        -h <= s*(T-T0) <= -tau   => \n        T-T0 >= ceil((-h)/s) and T-T0 <= floor((-tau)/s)   ??? But note: h and tau might be positive or negative.\n\n   Actually, the condition:\n        tau + s*(T-T0) <= 0   => s*(T-T0) <= -tau   => T-T0 <= floor(-tau/s)   [if s>0]\n        and 0 <= h + s*(T-T0)  => s*(T-T0) >= -h   => T-T0 >= ceil(-h/s)\n\n   For the car (48,37,right,12) on freeway3:\n        tau=37, h=48, s=12.\n\n        Condition: \n          37 + 12*(T-T0) <= 0 -> 12*(T-T0) <= -37 -> T-T0 <= -37/12 ≈ -3.08 -> so T-T0 <= -4? But T-T0>=0 -> no solution? \n\n        But wait, the car is at [37,48] at T0 and moving right. So it will never cover 0? Because 37>0 and moving right? \n\n        So indeed, this car never covers 0.\n\n   Similarly, the next car on freeway3: (12,1,right,12): \n        tau=1, h=12, s=12.\n        Condition: \n            1 + 12*(T-T0) <= 0 -> 12*(T-T0) <= -1 -> T-T0 <= -1/12 -> no nonnegative T-T0 satisfies -> safe.\n\n   And the last car: (-24,-35,right,12): \n        tau=-35, h=-24, s=12.\n        Condition:\n            -35 + 12*(T-T0) <= 0 -> 12*(T-T0) <= 35 -> T-T0 <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916 -> so T-T0 <= 2 (floor(2.916)=2)\n            and 0 <= -24 + 12*(T-T0) -> 12*(T-T0) >= 24 -> T-T0 >= 2.\n\n        So T-T0=2: \n            Check: at T0+2: \n                span: [ -35 + 12*2, -24 + 12*2 ] = [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11, 0] -> 0 is included? Yes, because the tail becomes -11 and head becomes 0? \n                Actually, the condition is: [tau + s*(T-T0), h + s*(T-T0)] = [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0]. \n                And 0 is in [-11,0]? Yes, because the interval is inclusive? The problem says \"span\", so we assume inclusive.\n\n        So this car on freeway3 is dangerous at T0+2 (turn 20).\n\n   Therefore, for freeway3, dangerous at T0+2 (because of the third car).\n\nSimilarly, freeway4 and freeway5 have the same cars as freeway3? So also dangerous at T0+2.\n\nFreeway6: only one car: (48,37,right,6). \n   This car: [37,48] at T0, moving right -> never covers 0.\n\nFreeway7: same as freeway6: safe.\n\nFreeway8: two cars:\n   First: (48,37,right,6): same as above -> safe.\n   Second: (0,-11,right,6): \n        tau=-11, h=0, s=6.\n        Condition: \n            -11 + 6*(T-T0) <= 0 -> 6*(T-T0) <= 11 -> T-T0 <= 11/6 ≈ 1.833 -> T-T0 <= 1.\n            and 0 <= 0 + 6*(T-T0) -> 6*(T-T0) >= 0 -> T-T0 >= 0.\n\n        So for T-T0=0: \n            at T0: span = [-11+0, 0+0] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? Yes.\n        T-T0=1: \n            [-11+6, 0+6] = [-5,6] -> 0 included? Yes.\n        T-T0=2: \n            [-11+12, 0+12] = [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n\n        So dangerous at T0 (turn 18) and T0+1 (turn 19).\n\nBut note: we are at turn T0=18. At turn 18, we are at y=0 (which is not a freeway). So we don't check freeway8 at turn18? \n\nHowever, if we are on freeway8 at turn18, then we would collide. But we start at y=0, so we are not on freeway8 at turn18. \n\nBut if we move to freeway8 at turn18? Actually, we choose an action at turn18 that will determine our position at turn19. \n\nAt turn18, we are at y18=0. We choose an action a18. Then:\n   y19 = y18 + Delta(a18)\n\nIf we choose U at turn18, then we move to y19=1 (freeway1) at turn19? But note: at turn18, we are at y=0. At turn19, we are at y=1. \n\nWhen do we check collision? We check at the turn we are on the freeway. So at turn T, we are at y_T. We check the freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nTherefore, we are never on freeway8 at turn18 (since we start at y=0). But if we are on freeway8 at turn19, then we check at turn19: is freeway8 dangerous at turn19? Yes, because the second car on freeway8 is dangerous at turn19 (T0+1=19).\n\nSimilarly, if we are on freeway8 at turn18? We cannot because we start at y=0. \n\nSo for freeway8: dangerous turns are 18 and 19? But at turn18, we are not on freeway8. So we only care about turn19 and beyond? Actually, we only care about the turns when we are on the freeway.\n\nBut the car on freeway8 is dangerous at turn18 and turn19. However, we are not on freeway8 at turn18. We might be at turn19 if we move up to y=8? Wait, freeway8 is at y=8? The freeways are labeled by k=1..8, and they are at y=k? Yes.\n\nSo if we are at y=8 at turn T, then we check freeway8 at turn T.\n\nTherefore, if we are at y=8 at turn19, then we would collide because freeway8 is dangerous at turn19.\n\nBut note: we start at turn18 at y=0. Then at turn18, we choose an action. The next state (turn19) we are at y19 = 0 + (0,1, or -1). So we can only be at y=0,1, or -1? But y must be in [0,9]. So if we go down at turn18, we stay at 0? (because D: -1 but then clamped to 0). Actually, the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, and then bounded to [0,9]. \n\nSo at turn19, we can be at y=0 (if we did S or D) or y=1 (if we did U). \n\nTherefore, we cannot be at y=8 at turn19. So we don't have to worry about freeway8 at turn19? \n\nBut wait, we might be at freeway8 at a later turn.\n\nSo let's precompute for each freeway k (1..8) the set of dangerous turns (T>=18) when at least one car on k covers 0.\n\nFreeway1: only dangerous at T=20 (T0+2)\nFreeway2: same as freeway1: dangerous at T=20\nFreeway3: dangerous at T=20 (because of the third car)\nFreeway4: same as freeway3: dangerous at T=20\nFreeway5: same: dangerous at T=20\nFreeway6: no dangerous turns? because the car is [37,48] moving right -> never covers 0.\nFreeway7: same as freeway6: safe.\nFreeway8: \n   The first car: (48,37,right,6): safe (never covers 0)\n   The second car: (0,-11,right,6): dangerous at T=18 and T=19? \n        But at T=18: the car is at [ -11, 0 ]? Actually, at T0=18: \n            for the second car: head=0, tail=-11, direction=right -> span at T0: [tau, h] = [-11,0] -> so at T0=18, the car is from -11 to 0? Then at T0+0: [ -11 + 6*0, 0+6*0] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included.\n        At T0+1: [ -11+6, 0+6] = [-5,6] -> 0 included.\n        At T0+2: [ -11+12, 0+12] = [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n\n        So dangerous at T=18 and T=19.\n\nBut note: we are at T0=18, and we are not on freeway8 at T0. So we care about T>=18? Yes, but we are only on freeway8 when we are at y=8 at that turn.\n\nSo for freeway8, dangerous turns: 18 and 19? But we are not at freeway8 at turn18 (we are at y=0). And at turn19, we can only be at y=0,1. So we are not at freeway8 at turn19 either.\n\nTherefore, freeway8 is dangerous at turns 18 and 19, but we won't be on freeway8 at those turns. So we only need to worry about freeway8 at turns >=20? \n\nAt turn20: freeway8 second car: [1,12] -> not covering 0. So freeway8 is safe at turn20 and beyond.\n\nSo freeway8 is safe for us if we are on it at turn>=20.\n\nBut note: we might be on freeway8 at a later turn. Since freeway8 is dangerous only at turns 18 and 19, and we skip those, then freeway8 is safe at turn20 and beyond.\n\nSimilarly, freeway1,2,3,4,5 are dangerous only at turn20? So we must avoid being on these freeways at turn20.\n\nBut freeway6 and freeway7 are always safe.\n\nNow, we must go from y=0 to y=9. We can move up, down, or stay. We want minimal turns.\n\nThe minimal path without obstacles: 9 consecutive U moves: \n   Turn18: U -> y=1 at turn19\n   Turn19: U -> y=2 at turn20\n   ...\n   Turn26: U -> y=9 at turn27.\n\nBut at turn20, we are at y=2 (freeway2). And freeway2 is dangerous at turn20 -> collision.\n\nSo we must avoid being on freeway2 at turn20.\n\nSimilarly, if we are at freeway1 at turn20: dangerous. Freeway3,4,5 at turn20: dangerous.\n\nBut freeway6,7,8: safe at turn20.\n\nSo we must not be on freeway1,2,3,4,5 at turn20.\n\nWe can try to delay or accelerate our movement so that at turn20 we are not on freeway1..5.\n\nWe start at y0=0 at turn18.\n\nAt turn19: we can be at y=0 (if S or D) or y=1 (if U).\n\nAt turn20: if we were at y=0 at turn19, then we can go to y=0,1 (if S/D or U). If we were at y=1 at turn19, then we can go to y=0,1,2.\n\nWe must avoid being at y=1,2,3,4,5 at turn20.\n\nSo at turn20, we must be at y=0 or y=6,7,8? \n\nBut from turn19, we can only be at y=0 or y=1. Then at turn20, we can only be at y=0,1 (if we were at y=0 at turn19) or y=0,1,2 (if we were at y=1 at turn19). \n\nSo we cannot reach y=6,7,8 at turn20.\n\nTherefore, the only safe option at turn20 is to be at y=0.\n\nSo we must be at y=0 at turn20.\n\nHow?\n   At turn18: we start at y=0. We can choose S or D (which keeps y=0) or U (which goes to y=1 at turn19).\n   Then at turn19: if we are at y=0, we can choose S or D to stay at 0, so at turn20 we are at y=0.\n            if we are at y=1, we can choose D to go to y=0 at turn20.\n\nSo two possibilities:\n\nOption 1:\n   Turn18: S (or D) -> stay at y=0 at turn19.\n   Turn19: S (or D) -> stay at y=0 at turn20.\n\nOption 2:\n   Turn18: U -> to y=1 at turn19.\n   Turn19: D -> to y=0 at turn20.\n\nBoth options get us to y=0 at turn20.\n\nBut note: at turn19, if we are at y=1 (in option2), then we are on freeway1 at turn19. Is freeway1 dangerous at turn19? \n   Freeway1: dangerous only at turn20? Not at turn19? \n        We computed freeway1: dangerous only at turn20? \n        For freeway1: car (48,83,left,36) at turn19 (T0+1=19):\n            head: 48-36=12, tail:83-36=47 -> [12,47] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway2 at turn19: same -> safe.\n\nSo both options are safe for turn19.\n\nBut we must also consider the entire path.\n\nAfter turn20, we are at y=0. Then we need to get to y=9. The minimal remaining moves: 9 moves (if we go up every turn). That would take 9 turns: from turn20 to turn28.\n\nBut at turn20, we are safe (y=0). Then:\n\n   Turn20: U -> y=1 at turn21\n   Turn21: U -> y=2 at turn22\n   Turn22: U -> y=3 at turn23\n   Turn23: U -> y=4 at turn24\n   Turn24: U -> y=5 at turn25\n   Turn25: U -> y=6 at turn26\n   Turn26: U -> y=7 at turn27\n   Turn27: U -> y=8 at turn28\n   Turn28: U -> y=9 at turn29.\n\nBut note: at turn21, we are at y=1. Is freeway1 dangerous at turn21? \n   Freeway1: we computed dangerous only at turn20? \n        At turn21: T0+3=21 -> head:48-36*3=48-108=-60, tail=83-108=-25 -> [-60,-25] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway2: same.\n\nFreeway3: we computed dangerous only at turn20? \n        The third car: (-24,-35,right,12) at turn20: [-11,0] -> dangerous. \n        At turn21: \n            [ -35+12*(21-18)= -35+36=1, -24+36=12 ] -> [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nSo freeway1..5 are safe after turn20.\n\nBut what about freeway8? We know it's safe after turn20.\n\nSo this path (after turn20) is safe.\n\nTotal turns: from turn18 to turn29? That's 12 turns? But note: we start at turn18 (T0) and we take actions at turns 18,19,...,28 (11 actions) to reach y=9 at turn29? \n\nBut note: the sequence of actions: \n   We take an action at turn18, then turn19, ... until the last action that gets us to y=9.\n\nAt turn18: action a18 -> then at turn19 we are at y19.\n...\nAt turn28: action a28 -> then at turn29 we are at y29=9.\n\nSo we take 12 actions? (turns 18 to 29 inclusive: 12 actions) and H=12.\n\nBut we have two options for the first two moves.\n\nOption1: \n   Turn18: S (or D) -> at turn19: y=0\n   Turn19: S (or D) -> at turn20: y=0\n\nThen from turn20 to turn28: 9 U moves -> that's 9 actions.\n\nTotal actions: 2 (for turns18,19) + 9 = 11? \n\nWait: \n   Actions: \n        turn18: S -> at turn19: y=0\n        turn19: S -> at turn20: y=0\n        turn20: U -> at turn21: y=1\n        ...\n        turn28: U -> at turn29: y=9\n\n   So we took actions from turn18 to turn28 (inclusive) -> 11 actions? and we reach y=9 at turn29.\n\n   H = number of turns in the sequence = 11.\n\nOption2:\n   Turn18: U -> at turn19: y=1\n   Turn19: D -> at turn20: y=0\n   Then turn20 to turn28: 9 U moves -> same as above.\n\n   Also 11 actions.\n\nBut can we do better? \n\nWe are forced to be at y=0 at turn20 to avoid the collision. Then we need at least 9 moves to go from 0 to 9. So total moves: 2 (for the first two) + 9 = 11.\n\nIs there a way to get to 9 faster? \n\nNote: we are at y=0 at turn20. The minimal time to go from 0 to 9 is 9 moves (if we go up every time). So total turns: 11.\n\nBut what if we go faster in the beginning? We can only move one step per turn. \n\nAlternatively, we could try to avoid the collision by being at a safe freeway at turn20? But we saw that we cannot be at freeway6,7,8 at turn20 because we start too low.\n\nAnother idea: what if we go down? But we start at 0 and cannot go below 0. So we are stuck at 0.\n\nSo 11 moves is the minimal? \n\nBut let me check: what if we do nothing for two turns (stay at 0) and then go up? That's 11 moves.\n\nAlternatively, we could go up and then down? Then we are at 0 at turn20, same as above.\n\nSo both options yield 11 moves.\n\nWe can choose either. Let me choose Option1: stay at 0 for the first two moves.\n\nBut note: at turn19, if we stay at 0, we are safe. At turn20, we are safe at 0.\n\nThen we go up every move: turns20 to 28: U.\n\nBut wait: at turn20: we are at y=0. Then we do U at turn20 -> at turn21: y=1.\n\nWe need to check for each freeway we step on:\n\n   turn21: y=1 -> freeway1: at turn21, car on freeway1: [ -60, -25] -> safe.\n   turn22: y=2 -> freeway2: at turn22: same car -> [48-36*(22-18)=48-144=-96, 83-144=-61] -> safe.\n   turn23: y=3 -> freeway3: at turn23: \n        The third car: (-24,-35,right,12): at turn23: T0+5=23 -> [ -35+12*5 = -35+60=25, -24+60=36] -> [25,36] -> safe.\n   ... and so on.\n\nSo safe.\n\nBut what about freeway8? We are at y=8 at turn28? \n   At turn28: y=8 -> freeway8: \n        The second car: at turn28: T0+10=28 -> [ -11+6*10 = -11+60=49, 0+60=60] -> [49,60] -> safe.\n\nSo the entire sequence is safe.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11.\n\nSequence:\n\n   Turn18: S (or D? but S is equivalent to D in this case because we are at 0 and D would also keep at 0. However, the problem says: D: -1 but then clamped to 0? Actually, the update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, and then bounded to [0,9]. So if we do D at y=0: 0-1 = -1 -> then bounded to 0. So same as S. Similarly, S: 0+0=0.\n\n   We can choose S for clarity.\n\n   Turn19: S (or D) -> again, same.\n\n   Then from turn20 to turn28: U.\n\nBut note: the actions are for turns: \n   Turn18: S\n   Turn19: S\n   Turn20: U\n   Turn21: U\n   Turn22: U\n   Turn23: U\n   Turn24: U\n   Turn25: U\n   Turn26: U\n   Turn27: U\n   Turn28: U\n\nAt turn28: we do U and then at turn29 we are at y=9.\n\nBut the problem: we need to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. \n\nWe started at turn t1=18. We take H=11 actions: from turn18 to turn28. Then at turn29 = 18+11, we are at (0,9). \n\nBut the sequence of actions is for t = t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nSo we have 11 actions: for turns 18,19,...,28.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\nTurn 18: S\nTurn 19: S\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\n\nBut wait: is there a possibility to get there faster? \n\nWhat if we do not wait two turns? We must avoid being on freeway1..5 at turn20. We cannot jump to freeway6 at turn20? \n\nAlternatively, we could go up to freeway6 by turn20? \n\nAt turn18: start at 0.\nTurn18: U -> 1 at turn19.\nTurn19: U -> 2 at turn20. -> but then at turn20 we are at freeway2 -> collision.\n\nTurn18: U -> 1 at turn19.\nTurn19: U -> 2 at turn20: collision.\n\nTurn18: U -> 1 at turn19.\nTurn19: U -> 2 at turn20: collision.\n\nWe cannot get to freeway6 (y=6) in two moves from 0: that would require 6 moves? \n\nSo we cannot avoid the two turns of waiting? \n\nBut note: we could go down? but we are at 0, so we cannot go down.\n\nTherefore, we must wait two turns at 0.\n\nBut what about Option2: \n   Turn18: U -> at turn19: y=1 (freeway1) -> but at turn19, freeway1 is safe (as computed: [12,47] doesn't cover 0).\n   Turn19: D -> at turn20: y=0 -> safe.\n\nThen we do 9 U moves. Same total moves.\n\nWe can choose either. Let me choose Option2 to show we can move.\n\nBut in Option2, we are at freeway1 at turn19. We must check: \n   Freeway1 at turn19: \n        Car: [48-36*(19-18)=48-36=12, 83-36=47] -> [12,47] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nTherefore, we can also do:\n\n   Turn18: U\n   Turn19: D\n   Turn20: U\n   ... same as above.\n\nBut then we have one extra move? No, same total: 11 moves.\n\nBut note: we are at y=1 at turn19, then we go down to 0 at turn20, and then we go up. \n\nWe can also consider: after turn20, we are at 0, then we go up. \n\nBut is there a way to do 10 moves? \n\nWe need to be at y=9 at turn28? \n\nHow? \n   We must be at y=0 at turn20. Then from turn20 to turn28: 8 moves? \n        At turn20: y0=0\n        After 8 moves: y = 8 (if we do 8 U moves) -> then we need one more to get to 9.\n\nSo we need 9 moves from turn20 to turn28? That's 9 moves (from turn20 to turn28 inclusive: 9 actions) to get from 0 to 9.\n\nBut if we do 8 moves: we get to y=8 at turn28. Then we are not at 9. So we need the 9th move at turn28 to get to 9 at turn29.\n\nTherefore, we must have 11 moves.\n\nBut note: what if we don't go straight up? \n\nFor example, after turn20, we could go faster? But we can only go one step per turn.\n\nSo 11 moves is minimal.\n\nWe can choose either sequence. Let me write the first one (staying at 0 for two turns).\n\nBut note: the problem says to output the sequence for turns starting at t1=18.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 18: S\nTurn 19: S\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\n\nBut wait: after 11 actions, we have 11 lines? \n\nThe answer format: \n   Turn t1: a_{t1}\n   Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n   ...\n   Turn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nWe have H=11, so we output actions for turn18 to turn28.\n\nBut let me double-check the turn when we reach 9:\n\n   Start: turn18: (0,0)\n   After action at turn18: S -> at turn19: (0,0)\n   After action at turn19: S -> at turn20: (0,0)\n   After action at turn20: U -> at turn21: (0,1)\n   ... \n   After action at turn28: U -> at turn29: (0,9)\n\nSo we are at (0,9) at turn29, which is after the last action (at turn28). This matches.\n\nAlternatively, if we do:\n\n   Turn18: U -> at turn19: (0,1)\n   Turn19: D -> at turn20: (0,0)\n   Turn20: U -> at turn21: (0,1)\n   ... same as above.\n\nBut then we are at (0,9) at turn29 as well.\n\nI think both are acceptable. Let me choose the first one.\n\nBut note: in the second sequence, at turn19 we are at y=1 (freeway1) and we have to check: freeway1 at turn19 is safe. And freeway1 at turn20: we are not on freeway1 at turn20 (we are at y=0) so we avoid the collision.\n\nSo we can choose either.\n\nI'll choose the first one to avoid moving up and then down.\n\nBut the problem: minimal number of turns. Both have the same H=11.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 18: S\nTurn 19: S\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence\". We have H=11.\n\nBut let me check if we can do H=10? \n\nIf we do 10 actions, we would be at turn28: after 10 actions (from turn18 to turn27). Then at turn28 we are at y? \n\nIf we start at 0 at turn18, and we do 10 actions:\n\n   We must be at y=0 at turn20 (to avoid collision). Then from turn20 to turn27: 8 actions. \n        We can go up 8 times: so at turn28 (after the 10th action) we are at y=8? \n\nBut we need to be at y=9. So we are not at 9.\n\nAlternatively, if we try to go up earlier? \n\nBut we cannot skip the wait at turn20: we must be at 0 at turn20.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nTherefore, H=11 is minimal.\n\nOne more thing: at turn20, we are at 0, which is safe. Then we go up. But note: at turn21, we are at freeway1. Is freeway1 safe at turn21? Yes, as computed.\n\nSo the sequence is safe.\n\nWe'll output the sequence.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 18\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on any dangerous freeway during dangerous turns.\n\n- At turn 20, freeways \\(y = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\) are dangerous due to cars covering \\(x = 0\\). To avoid collision, the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) at turn 20.\n- The player starts at \\(y = 0\\) at turn 18. By choosing \"S\" (stay) for turns 18 and 19, the player remains at \\(y = 0\\) at turns 19 and 20, avoiding all dangerous freeways.\n- From turn 20 onwards, the player moves up (\"U\") every turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 29.\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n- Turn 18: \"S\" – Player stays at \\((0, 0)\\) at turn 19.\n- Turn 19: \"S\" – Player stays at \\((0, 0)\\) at turn 20.\n- Turn 20: \"U\" – Player moves to \\((0, 1)\\) at turn 21.\n- Turn 21: \"U\" – Player moves to \\((0, 2)\\) at turn 22.\n- Turn 22: \"U\" – Player moves to \\((0, 3)\\) at turn 23.\n- Turn 23: \"U\" – Player moves to \\((0, 4)\\) at turn 24.\n- Turn 24: \"U\" – Player moves to \\((0, 5)\\) at turn 25.\n- Turn 25: \"U\" – Player moves to \\((0, 6)\\) at turn 26.\n- Turn 26: \"U\" – Player moves to \\((0, 7)\\) at turn 27.\n- Turn 27: \"U\" – Player moves to \\((0, 8)\\) at turn 28.\n- Turn 28: \"U\" – Player moves to \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 29.\n\nThis sequence is safe because:\n- At turn 19 (\\(y = 0\\)), no freeway collision is possible.\n- At turn 20 (\\(y = 0\\)), no freeway collision is possible.\n- For turns 21 to 28 (\\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\)), the cars on the respective freeways do not cover \\(x = 0\\) at these turns, as verified by the car update rules and precomputed dangerous turns.\n\nThe total number of actions \\(H = 11\\) is minimal, as being at \\(y = 0\\) at turn 20 is necessary to avoid collision, and then 9 \"U\" moves are required to reach \\(y = 9\\).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 18: S\nTurn 19: S\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: U\nTurn 23: U\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 19, and I start at y=0.\n\nFirst, I should understand the car movements. Cars move left or right at their speeds, and I need to make sure that when I'm on a freeway row at a certain turn, the x=0 position isn't covered by any car on that row at that turn.\n\nThe collision rule says: collision occurs at turn T only if 0 is in the span of any car on freeway y_T at that turn T.\n\nAlso, when I move, at turn T, I'm on y_T, and I decide to go to y_{T+1}, but at turn T, I'm still on y_T, so I only check for cars on y_T at turn T. When I arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1, I check for cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe player update: at each turn, I choose an action: U (up, y increases by 1), D (down, y decreases by 1), or S (stay, y same). y is always between 0 and 9.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nStarting at y=0 at turn 19.\n\nThe cars are given for freeways 1 to 8.\n\nLet me list all the cars for each freeway row.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head 12, tail 47, direction left, speed 36. But direction left, and span [h, τ], with h=12, τ=47? That seems odd because usually head and tail, for left-moving, if it's moving left, head should be the left end or right end?\n\nThe car update rules:\n\nFor left-moving car: span at t_1 is [h, τ], and at time T, it's [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nSince it's moving left, decreasing x.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (12, 47, left, 36)\n\nBut [12,47], and moving left, so at time T, [12 - 36(T-19), 47 - 36(T-19)]\n\nBut 12 and 47, with 12 < 47, so as it moves left, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2: same as freeway 1, (12,47,left,36)\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: (60,49,right,12), (24,13,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nFor right-moving, span is [τ, h] at t_1? The notation says: for right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h], so for first car: τ=60, h=49? That would be [60,49], but 60>49, so it's from 49 to 60? I think the order might be inconsistent.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nFor car k on freeway i, it says head h, tail τ.\n\nBut in the span definition, for left-moving: span(t_1) = [h, τ], so h is the head, which I think is the front.\n\nFor left-moving car, front is on the left, so as it moves left, both ends decrease.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h], and it says \"right-moving: [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\" so for example, if τ and h, with τ < h, then [τ, h] moves to [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT].\n\nBut in the table, for freeway 3, first car: (60,49,right,12), but if span is [τ,h] = [60,49], which is empty if 60>49? That can't be right.\n\nI think there might be a confusion in the notation.\n\nLet me look back.\n\n\" For car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail is at τ at turn t_1\"\n\nThen for left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ]\"\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\"\n\nAnd for left-moving, when moving left, span becomes [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nFor right-moving, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nNow, in the car list, for freeway 3: (60,49,right,12)\n\nIf it's right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h] = [60,49]? But if 60 and 49, and [60,49] means from 49 to 60? But 49 to 60 is increasing, so [49,60] would make sense, but it's written as [τ,h] with τ=60, h=49, so if τ > h, [60,49] is invalid as an interval.\n\nI think there's a mistake in the interpretation.\n\nPerhaps \"head\" and \"tail\" are misnomered, or the span is always from min to max.\n\nLet me see the values.\n\nFor freeway 3, cars: (60,49,right,12) — if right-moving, and span [τ,h] = [60,49], but since it's moving right, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [60 + sΔT, 49 + sΔT], which would be decreasing if 60>49, but that doesn't make sense for a car moving right.\n\nI think it's likely that for the right-moving car, the head h is the front, so for right-moving, front is on the right, so h should be larger than τ.\n\nIn this case, for (60,49,right,12), if h=60, τ=49, then for right-moving, span is [τ,h] = [49,60], and it moves to [49 + sΔT, 60 + sΔT].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nLet me check the other cars to confirm.\n\nSecond car on freeway 3: (24,13,right,12) — h=24, τ=13? If [τ,h] = [13,24] for right-moving.\n\nThird car: (-12,-23,right,12) — h=-12, τ=-23, so [τ,h] = [-23,-12], moving right to [-23 + sΔT, -12 + sΔT].\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, like freeway 1: (12,47,left,36) — h=12, τ=47, span [h,τ] = [12,47], moving left to [12 - sΔT, 47 - sΔT].\n\nNow, for freeway 4 and 5, same as freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 4: same cars as freeway 3: (60,49,right,12), (24,13,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nSimilarly freeway 5 same.\n\nFreeway 6: (54,43,right,6) — so for right-moving, span [τ,h] = [43,54]? h=54, τ=43? Table says (54,43,right,6), so if head is 54, tail is 43, then for right-moving, span should be [τ,h] = [43,54], moves to [43 +6ΔT, 54 +6ΔT].\n\nSimilarly freeway 7: same as 6, (54,43,right,6)\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: (54,43,right,6) and (6,-5,right,6)\n\nFirst car: (54,43,right,6) span [43,54] moving right.\n\nSecond car: (6,-5,right,6) — head 6, tail -5, so span [τ,h] = [-5,6], moving right to [-5 +6ΔT, 6 +6ΔT].\n\nNow, current turn t_1 = 19.\n\nI need to find a sequence of actions to go from y=0 to y=9, starting at turn 19.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 have no cars, I only need to worry about rows 1 to 8 when I'm on them.\n\nThe minimal H might be 9, if I go up every turn, but I need to avoid collisions on the rows I land on.\n\nSince I start at y=0 at turn 19, and I move to y=1 at turn 20, and so on, but at each turn when I'm on a row, I need that row to be safe at that turn.\n\nLet me denote the time from current: let τ = T - t_1, so at τ=0, turn T=19, y=0.\n\nThen at time τ, turn T=19+τ.\n\nPlayer position: at τ=0, y=0.\n\nAfter action, at τ=1, y could be 0 or 1, depending on action at τ=0.\n\nThe action is chosen at the beginning of the turn.\n\nAt each turn T, I choose a_t for that turn, which determines y_{T+1}, but y_T is my position at turn T.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn T, player is at position (0, y_T).\n\nThen I choose action a_T, which determines Δy_T, so y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, I am at (0, y_{T+1}).\n\nCollision at turn T: if for the freeway k = y_T, there is a car with 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nSo, when I am on row y at turn T, I need that no car on that row has 0 in its span at that exact turn.\n\nNow, for rows with cars, I need to find when 0 is covered.\n\nSince I start at y=0 at T=19, and y=0 has no cars, so at T=19, no collision, regardless.\n\nI need to go to y=9, which also has no cars.\n\nThe path must go through rows 1 to 8 at some turns.\n\nI need to find for each row, the times when it is safe, i.e., 0 not covered by any car.\n\nThen I can plan a path through safe times.\n\nSince I can move up, down, or stay, I have some flexibility, but I want minimal turns, so probably I want to go up as much as possible, but avoiding unsafe times.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway row, the set of times when it is unsafe, i.e., 0 is covered by some car on that row.\n\nLet ΔT = T - 19, so time offset.\n\nFor a given row, and time ΔT, is 0 in the span of any car?\n\nRow 1: one car, left-moving, span at T: [12 - 36(ΔT), 47 - 36(ΔT)]\n\nSet [L, R] = [12 - 36ΔT, 47 - 36ΔT]\n\n0 is covered if L <= 0 <= R, i.e., 12 - 36ΔT <= 0 <= 47 - 36ΔT\n\nSo, 12 - 36ΔT <= 0 => 12 <= 36ΔT => ΔT >= 12/36 = 1/3\n\nAnd 0 <= 47 - 36ΔT => 36ΔT <= 47 => ΔT <= 47/36 ≈ 1.3056\n\nSo for ΔT from ceil(1/3) to floor(47/36), but since ΔT integer, ΔT min when 12 -36ΔT <=0, ΔT >= 1/3, so since ΔT integer, ΔT >= 1\n\nΔT max when 47 -36ΔT >=0, ΔT <= 47/36 ≈1.305, so ΔT <=1\n\nΔT >= ceil(1/3) = 1? 1/3=0.333, ceil to 1? But let's see inequality.\n\n12 -36ΔT <=0 when ΔT >= 12/36 = 1/3, so for ΔT=0: 12 -0 =12 >0, so L=12>0, so 0 not <= L, and since L>0, 0 not in [L,R] because L>0.\n\nAt ΔT=0: L=12, R=47, both >0, so 0 not in [12,47]\n\nAt ΔT=1: L=12-36= -24, R=47-36=11, so [-24,11], 0 is between -24 and 11, so 0 is covered, unsafe.\n\nAt ΔT=2: L=12-72= -60, R=47-72= -25, both negative, -60 <= -25, so [ -60, -25], 0 not in, since 0 > -25? -25 <0, and -60< -25 <0, so 0 not in [ -60,-25], since -25 <0.\n\nSo unsafe only at ΔT=1.\n\nΔT=1: [ -24,11], 0 in it.\n\nΔT=0: [12,47], 0 not <=12? 0<12, not in.\n\nΔT=2: [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSo row 1 unsafe only at ΔT=1, i.e., turn T=19+1=20.\n\nSimilarly, row 2 has same car, so also unsafe only at T=20.\n\nNow row 3: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (60,49,right,12) — right-moving, so at t_1, span [τ,h] = [49,60]? Earlier we said for right-moving, (h,tail,dir,speed), so for (60,49,right,12), head=60, tail=49, so span [τ,h] = [49,60]\n\nThen at T, span [49 +12(ΔT), 60 +12(ΔT)]\n\nSet [L1,R1] = [49 +12ΔT, 60 +12ΔT]\n\n0 covered if L1 <=0 <= R1\n\n49 +12ΔT <=0 and 0 <=60 +12ΔT\n\nBut 49+12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <= -49, impossible since ΔT>=0, so never <=0. And 0 <=60+12ΔT always true for ΔT>=0. But for coverage, need L1 <=0 <= R1.\n\nL1 =49+12ΔT >0 for all ΔT>=0, so 0 < L1, not <= L1, so 0 not in [L1,R1] for any ΔT. So this car never covers 0.\n\nSecond car on row 3: (24,13,right,12) — head=24, tail=13, right-moving, span [τ,h] = [13,24] at t_1.\n\nAt T, [13 +12ΔT, 24 +12ΔT]\n\nL2 =13+12ΔT, R2=24+12ΔT\n\n0 covered if L2 <=0 <= R2\n\nL2 <=0: 13+12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <= -13, impossible, L2>0 always, so 0 never covered.\n\nThird car: (-12,-23,right,12) — head=-12, tail=-23, right-moving, span [τ,h] = [-23,-12] at t_1.\n\nAt T, [ -23 +12ΔT, -12 +12ΔT ]\n\nSet [L3,R3] = [-23 +12ΔT, -12 +12ΔT]\n\n0 covered if L3 <=0 <= R3\n\nL3 <=0: -23 +12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <=23 => ΔT <= 23/12 ≈1.916, so ΔT <=1\n\nAnd 0 <= R3: 0 <= -12 +12ΔT => 12 <=12ΔT => ΔT >=1\n\nSo for ΔT=1: L3= -23+12= -11, R3= -12+12=0, so [-11,0], 0 is included since <= R3=0.\n\nAt ΔT=1, [ -11, 0], 0 is covered.\n\nAt ΔT=0: L3=-23, R3=-12, both negative, [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nAt ΔT=2: L3= -23+24=1, R3= -12+24=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at ΔT=1, this car covers 0.\n\nTherefore, for row 3, unsafe when this third car covers 0, at ΔT=1.\n\nSimilarly, rows 4 and 5 have same cars, so also unsafe only at ΔT=1.\n\nNow row 6: one car (54,43,right,6) — head=54, tail=43, right-moving, span [τ,h] = [43,54] at t_1.\n\nAt T, [43 +6ΔT, 54 +6ΔT]\n\nL=43+6ΔT >0 always, so 0 never covered. Safe at all times.\n\nSimilarly, row 7: same as row 6, safe at all times.\n\nNow row 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (54,43,right,6) same as above, never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: (6,-5,right,6) — head=6, tail=-5, right-moving, span [τ,h] = [-5,6] at t_1.\n\nAt T, [ -5 +6ΔT, 6 +6ΔT ]\n\nSet [L,R] = [-5 +6ΔT, 6 +6ΔT]\n\n0 covered if L <=0 <= R\n\nL <=0: -5 +6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=5 => ΔT <= 5/6 ≈0.833, so ΔT=0 since ΔT integer.\n\n0 <= R: 0 <=6+6ΔT always true for ΔT>=0.\n\nAt ΔT=0: L=-5, R=6, [-5,6], 0 is in it.\n\nAt ΔT=1: L=-5+6=1, R=6+6=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nAt ΔT=2: [7,18], etc.\n\nSo only at ΔT=0, unsafe.\n\nΔT=0 is T=19.\n\nBut at T=19, we are at y=0, not on row 8, so for row 8, when we are on it, at that time, we need to check.\n\nUnsafe only at ΔT=0, i.e., T=19.\n\nNow, summary of unsafe times for each row:\n\n- Row 1: unsafe at T=20 (ΔT=1)\n\n- Row 2: unsafe at T=20 (ΔT=1)\n\n- Row 3: unsafe at T=20 (ΔT=1)\n\n- Row 4: unsafe at T=20 (ΔT=1)\n\n- Row 5: unsafe at T=20 (ΔT=1)\n\n- Row 6: always safe\n\n- Row 7: always safe\n\n- Row 8: unsafe at T=19 (ΔT=0)\n\nRows 1 to 5 are all unsafe only at T=20.\n\nRow 8 unsafe at T=19.\n\nRows 6 and 7 always safe.\n\nI start at T=19, y=0, which is safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal turns: if I go up every turn, I can reach y=9 in 9 turns: from T=19 to T=27, y from 0 to 9.\n\nBut let's see if I can do that without collision.\n\nAt each turn, when I am on a row, it must be safe.\n\nStart T=19, y=0, safe.\n\nAction: suppose I go up, so at T=20, y=1.\n\nBut at T=20, y=1, row 1 is unsafe at T=20! So collision if I am on row 1 at T=20.\n\nIf I stay or go down, but I need to go up eventually.\n\nAt T=19, I could choose to stay or go down, but y=0, if I go down, y=-1 not possible, y min 0, so D is invalid if y=0? y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, and y in [0,9], so if y=0, D would make y=-1, not allowed, so I cannot go down from y=0. Similarly, cannot go up from y=9.\n\nSo at y=0, actions: U or S, not D.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, U not possible, only D or S, but since we want to reach, probably not S.\n\nAt T=19, y=0, I can choose U or S.\n\nIf I choose U, at T=20, y=1, but row 1 unsafe at T=20, so collision.\n\nIf I choose S, at T=20, y=0, still safe, since y=0 no cars.\n\nThen at T=20, I am at y=0.\n\nNow, I need to go up later.\n\nBut row 1 to 5 are unsafe only at T=20, so after T=20, they are safe.\n\nFor example, row 1 unsafe only at T=20, so at T=21, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nRow 8 unsafe at T=19, but at T=19, I was on y=0, not row 8.\n\nAt later times, row 8 is safe, since only unsafe at T=19.\n\nFor row 8, unsafe at ΔT=0, T=19, so for T>19, it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, rows 1-5 unsafe only at T=20, so for T<20 or T>20, safe, but T=19 is before, T=21 and later safe.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9.\n\nIf I stay at y=0 at T=19, then at T=20, I am still y=0.\n\nThen I can start moving up.\n\nBut at T=20, if I go up to y=1 at T=21.\n\nT=20: I am at y=0, choose action.\n\nIf I choose U, then at T=21, y=1.\n\nNow, at T=21, y=1, row 1: is it safe? Row 1 unsafe only at T=20, so at T=21, safe. Similarly all rows safe except row 8 at T=19, but T=19 passed.\n\nSo from T=21, y=1, I can go up to y=2 at T=22, and so on.\n\nLet's list the turns.\n\nTurn T=19: position y=0, safe. I need to choose action for next position.\n\nTo minimize time, I should go up as soon as possible.\n\nBut at T=19, if I go up, I hit row 1 at T=20 when unsafe.\n\nSo I must not be on row 1 at T=20.\n\nSimilarly, I cannot be on rows 2-5 at T=20.\n\nBut rows 6-7 always safe, row 8 unsafe at T=19 only.\n\nSo possible to delay going up.\n\nAt T=19: I can choose S (stay), so at T=20, y=0.\n\nThen at T=20: I am at y=0, safe. Now I can choose U, so at T=21, y=1.\n\nAt T=21, y=1: row 1 is safe (since only unsafe at T=20), so no collision.\n\nThen I choose U, at T=22, y=2.\n\nSimilarly, row 2 safe at T=22, since unsafe only at T=20.\n\nSimilarly, at T=23, y=3, safe.\n\nT=24, y=4, safe.\n\nT=25, y=5, safe.\n\nNow y=5, row 5, safe at T=25.\n\nThen to y=6 at T=26.\n\ny=6, row 6 always safe.\n\ny=7 at T=27, safe.\n\ny=8 at T=28.\n\nNow y=8, row 8: is it safe at T=28?\n\nRow 8 unsafe only at T=19, so at T=28, safe.\n\nThen I can go to y=9 at T=29.\n\nAt T=28, y=8, I choose U, so at T=29, y=9.\n\nNow, I reached y=9 at T=29.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, from t=0 to H-1.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-1, and after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position should be (0,9), I think.\n\nLet's see the turn indexing.\n\nThe player is at position at turn t_1: (0, y_{t_1}) = (0,0)\n\nAfter actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position should be (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, so H actions.\n\nAfter a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}, that's H actions, so position after last action at turn t_1 + H.\n\nAt turn t, after action a_t, position y_{t+1}.\n\nSo at turn t_1 + H, y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nIn this case, start turn t_1=19, y=0.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn 19 + H, y=9.\n\nIn my plan: at T=19, I choose S, so y_20 = y_19 + Δy, but Δy for a_{19}, which is S, so y_{20} = 0.\n\nThen at T=20, choose U, so y_{21} = 1.\n\nT=21, U, y_{22} = 2\n\n...\n\nUp to T=28, choose U, y_{29} = 9.\n\nSo at turn 29, y=9.\n\nH actions: from t=19 to 28, that's 10 actions? t from 19 to 28 inclusive is 10 turns.\n\nt_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSet τ = t_1 + t, for t=0 to H-1.\n\nAt τ = t_1, action a_{t_1}, determines y_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{t_1 + H -1}, y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nIn my case, actions at τ=19 to 28, H=10 actions, y at turn 29=9.\n\nBut minimal? I could reach faster.\n\nSince rows 1-5 are only unsafe at T=20, and row 8 at T=19, I could go to higher rows earlier or later.\n\nFor example, at T=19, I could go to y=1, but at T=20 y=1 is unsafe, so not possible.\n\nStay at y=0 until after T=20.\n\nBut T=20 is the critical point.\n\nI could go to row 6 or 7 earlier, since they are always safe.\n\nBut I start from y=0, need to go up.\n\nMinimal time: to go from y=0 to y=9, with no obstacles, min 9 actions: all U, from T=19 to T=27, y at T=20=1, T=21=2, ..., T=28=8, T=29=9? Let's see:\n\nAt T=19, y=0, choose U, so y_{20} =1\n\nBut at T=20, position y=1, and row 1 unsafe, collision.\n\nSo impossible to go directly up at T=19.\n\nIf I stay at T=19, S, y_{20}=0\n\nThen at T=20, choose U, y_{21}=1, which is safe as above.\n\nBut that takes longer.\n\nCan I go to y=6 directly or something? But I have to go through lower rows.\n\nSince rows 6 and 7 are always safe, I could stay there, but I need to reach y=9.\n\nAnother idea: at T=19, I stay or move, but I can only stay since U causes problem.\n\nThen at T=20, I am at y=0, I can choose to go up to y=1, but row 1 is unsafe at T=20, so if I go to y=1 at T=21, but at T=20 I am at y=0.\n\nAt T=20, position y=0, I choose action for next position.\n\nIf I choose U, then at T=21, y=1, which is safe.\n\nIf I choose to go to a higher row, but I can only change by 1 per turn.\n\nSo I have to go step by step.\n\nPerhaps I can go down, but from y=0, I cannot go down.\n\nSo only options: at each turn, U, S, or D if possible.\n\nTo minimize time, I should avoid staying if possible.\n\nIn this case, since I have to skip T=20 for rows 1-5, I need to be on y=0 at T=20 or on y=6 or above, but y=6 is row 6, which is safe at all times.\n\nAt T=20, if I can be on y=6, then safe.\n\nBut from y=0, how to reach y=6 quickly.\n\nAt T=19, y=0, I choose U, but then at T=20 y=1, unsafe.\n\nChoose S, at T=20 y=0.\n\nThen from y=0 at T=20, I can only go to y=1 at T=21, then to y=2 at T=22, etc., up to y=6 at T=26? Let's see:\n\nT=20: y=0, choose U, y_{21}=1\n\nT=21: y=1, choose U, y_{22}=2\n\nT=22: y=2, U, y_{23}=3\n\nT=23: y=3, U, y_{24}=4\n\nT=24: y=4, U, y_{25}=5\n\nT=25: y=5, U, y_{26}=6\n\nNow at T=26, y=6, safe.\n\nThen I can go up to y=7 at T=27, y=8 at T=28, y=9 at T=29.\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut from T=25 y=5 to y=6 at T=26, row 5 is safe at T=25 and T=26? Row 5 unsafe only at T=20, so at T=25, safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut I reached y=6 at T=26.\n\nSince row 6 is always safe, I could go faster to row 6.\n\nBut from y=0, I need 6 steps to y=6.\n\nMinimal steps to y=6 is 6, but with the constraint.\n\nAt T=19, if I could be at higher y, but I start at y=0.\n\nAnother thought: I could go to row 8 at T=19, but row 8 is unsafe at T=19, and I am at y=0, not on it.\n\nBut if I were on row 8 at T=19, it would be unsafe, but I am not.\n\nTo reach y=9 faster, I need to start moving up later or something.\n\nPerhaps I can move down first, but from y=0, cannot.\n\nSo I think the earlier plan is fine, but takes 10 turns: actions from T=19 to T=28 for 10 actions, y at T=29=9.\n\nBut H=10.\n\nCan I do in 9 turns?\n\nSuppose I start at T=19, y=0.\n\nIf I go up at T=19, to y=1 at T=20, but unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf I stay, then at T=20 y=0.\n\nThen if I go up all the way, I reach y=9 at T=29 as before.\n\nPerhaps at some point I can skip a row or something, but no, I have to go through each integer y.\n\nUnless I stay multiple times, but that would take more turns.\n\nFor example, if I stay at some row, it takes extra turns.\n\nSo minimal should be 10 turns.\n\nBut let me confirm the unsafe times.\n\nRow 1: unsafe only at T=20.\n\nSimilarly row 2 to 5.\n\nRow 8 unsafe at T=19.\n\nNow, at T=19, if I could be on y=8, but I start at y=0.\n\nNot possible.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=6 quickly, but from y=0 to y=6 min 6 steps.\n\nFor example: suppose at T=19, S, y=0\n\nT=20, U, y=1\n\n...\n\nUp to T=25, U, y=6? T=20: after action U, y=1 at T=21? Let's list positions:\n\nTurn: position at that turn.\n\nT=19: y=0\n\nAfter action a_{19}, y_{20} set.\n\nAt T=19, I am at y=0, choose a_{19}, which affects y_{20}.\n\nThen at T=20, I am at y_{20}, which depends on a_{19}.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo for collision, at each turn T, when I am at position (0,y_T), I need that row y_T is safe at turn T.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nIf I do:\n\nT=19: y=0, safe, choose a_{19} = S, so y_{20} = 0 (since S, Δy=0)\n\nThen T=20: y=0, safe (y=0 no cars), now choose a_{20} = U, so y_{21} =1\n\nT=21: y=1, row 1 safe? At T=21, ΔT=21-19=2, row 1: at ΔT=2, span [12-72,47-72]=[-60,-25], 0 not in, safe.\n\nChoose U, y_{22}=2\n\nT=22: y=2, row 2 at ΔT=3? T=22, ΔT=3, row 2 same as row 1, [12-36*3,47-36*3]=[12-108,47-108]=[-96,-61], 0 not in, safe.\n\nChoose U, y_{23}=3\n\nT=23: y=3, row 3 at ΔT=4.\n\nRow 3 cars: first car [49+12*4,60+12*4]=[49+48,60+48]=[97,108] no\n\nSecond [13+48,24+48]=[61,72] no\n\nThird: [-23+48,-12+48]=[25,36] no, 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly rows 4 and 5 same.\n\nChoose U, y_{24}=4\n\nT=24: y=4, safe similarly, U, y_{25}=5\n\nT=25: y=5, safe, U, y_{26}=6\n\nT=26: y=6, row 6 always safe, U, y_{27}=7\n\nT=27: y=7, row 7 always safe, U, y_{28}=8\n\nT=28: y=8, row 8 at ΔT=9, T=28, ΔT=28-19=9.\n\nRow 8: first car [43+6*9,54+6*9]=[43+54,54+54]=[97,108] no\n\nSecond car: [-5+6*9,6+6*9]=[-5+54,6+54]=[49,60] no, 0 not in, safe.\n\nChoose U, y_{29}=9\n\nT=29: y=9, reached.\n\nActions: from T=19 to T=28, that is 10 actions: a19 to a28.\n\na19=S, a20=U, a21=U, ..., a28=U.\n\nAfter a28, y29=9.\n\nH=10.\n\nBut can I reach faster?\n\nSuppose I go to row 6 earlier, but I have to go through rows 1-5.\n\nSince rows 1-5 are only unsafe at T=20, if I can be on those rows at other times.\n\nFor example, if I could be on row 1 at T=19 or T=21, but at T=19 I start at y=0, not row 1.\n\nAt T=19, y=0.\n\nIf I go up at T=19, I arrive at y=1 at T=20, which is unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf I could be at y=5 at T=19, but impossible.\n\nSo I think 10 is minimal.\n\nBut let me check if I can start moving later but reach earlier? No.\n\nAnother idea: go down, but from y=0 cannot.\n\nOr stay multiple times, but that increases H.\n\nSo H=10 seems necessary.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have one stay at beginning.\n\nPerhaps I can go directly to a safe row.\n\nBut all rows except at specific times are safe, but I have to pass through.\n\nSpecifically, for row 1, it is safe except at T=20, so I can be on it at T=21, etc.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI think 10 is min.\n\nBut let me confirm the car for row 8.\n\nRow 8 unsafe at T=19 only.\n\nAt T=19, if I were on it, unsafe, but I start at y=0.\n\nIn the path above, I am on y=8 at T=28, safe.\n\nNow, to output the sequence.\n\nTurn t1=19.\n\nActions: for turn 19: S\n\nThen turn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 28: U\n\nAfter that, at turn 29, y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from turn 19 to 28, 10 actions.\n\nThe sequence should be actions from t=19 to t=28.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t1: a_{t1}, etc.\n\nt1=19.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 19: S\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nThen at turn 29, position y=9.\n\nIs there a way with H=9?\n\nSuppose I want to reach y=9 at turn 28.\n\nThat means at turn 28, y=9.\n\nThen y_{28} =9.\n\nThis must be after actions from turn 19 to 27? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 19, y=0.\n\nAfter 9 actions: from a19 to a27, that's 9 actions, y at turn 28.\n\ny_{19} =0\n\nAfter a19, y20\n\nAfter a20, y21\n\n...\n\nAfter a27, y28\n\nSo y28 =9.\n\nFrom y=0 to y=9 in 9 steps, must be all U, no stay or down.\n\nSo a19=U, then y20=1\n\na20=U, y21=2\n\n...\n\na27=U, y28=9\n\nNow, check collisions.\n\nAt turn 20: y=1, row 1 unsafe at T=20, collision! Cannot.\n\nIf I have a stay, but with 9 actions, if I have a stay, y increases less, so y28 <9 if not all U.\n\nFor example, if one S, then after 9 actions, y28 <=8 if start from 0.\n\ny19=0\n\nAfter first action, y20 = y19 + Δy19\n\nAfter k actions, y_{19+k}\n\nTo have y_{19+9} = y28 =9, since start y19=0, must have sum of Δy =9 over 9 actions, so all U, no S or D.\n\nBut then at turn 20, y=1, row 1 unsafe, collision.\n\nTherefore impossible in 9 turns.\n\nThus minimal H=10.\n\nSequence as above.\n\nIn the sequence, I have a19=S, then a20 to a28=U, but a20 to a28 is 9 actions, plus a19, total 10.\n\ny after a19: y20=0\n\nAfter a20=U, y21=1\n\n...\n\nAfter a27=U, y28=8\n\nAfter a28=U, y29=9\n\nIn terms of actions: actions from t=19 to t=28 for H=10.\n\nTo reach at turn t1+H=19+H.\n\nSet to 9, so 19+H=29, H=10.\n\nNow, in the sequence, for row 5, at T=25, y=5, is it safe? T=25, ΔT=6, row 5 cars same as row 3, at ΔT=6:\n\nFirst car [49+72,60+72]=[121,132] no\n\nSecond [13+72,24+72]=[85,96] no\n\nThird [-23+72,-12+72]=[49,60] no, 0 not in, safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nRow 8 at T=28, ΔT=9, as before, safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 10.\n\nSequence of actions:\n\nTurn 19: S\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: U\n\nTurn 23: U\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nBut the turn is given as t_1, which is 19.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 19: a_{19} = S\n\nTurn 20: a_{20} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 28: a_{28} = U\n\nAnd that's 10 lines.\n\nSince it says {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so t=0: t_1 +0=19, t=1:20, ..., t=9:28.\n\nH=10, t from 0 to 9.\n\nActions: t=0: S, t=1: U, t=2: U, ..., t=9: U.\n\nBut in the box, it should list each turn.\n\nNow, I think that's it.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 8, there is a car at (6,-5,right,6), which at T=19 covers 0, but we avoid it.\n\nIn the path, we are not on row 8 at T=19.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo, I think correct.\n</think>\nTo reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 19\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 10. The sequence of actions is designed to avoid the unsafe times for each row:\n\n- Rows 1 to 5 are unsafe only at turn \\(T = 20\\) (i.e., \\(\\Delta T = 1\\)).\n- Row 8 is unsafe only at turn \\(T = 19\\) (i.e., \\(\\Delta T = 0\\)).\n- Rows 6 and 7 are always safe.\n\nStarting at \\(y = 0\\) at turn 19, which is safe (no cars on \\(y = 0\\)), the player must avoid being on rows 1 to 5 at turn 20. Therefore, the player stays at \\(y = 0\\) at turn 19 (action S), so at turn 20, the player is still at \\(y = 0\\), which is safe. From turn 20 onwards, the player moves up (action U) each turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 29.\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n\n- At turn 19, action S: stay at \\(y = 0\\) (safe).\n- At turn 20, action U: move to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 21 (row 1 is safe at turn 21 since unsafe only at turn 20).\n- At turn 21, action U: move to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 22 (row 2 safe at turn 22).\n- At turn 22, action U: move to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 23 (row 3 safe at turn 23).\n- At turn 23, action U: move to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 24 (row 4 safe at turn 24).\n- At turn 24, action U: move to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 25 (row 5 safe at turn 25).\n- At turn 25, action U: move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 26 (row 6 always safe).\n- At turn 26, action U: move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 27 (row 7 always safe).\n- At turn 27, action U: move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 28 (row 8 safe at turn 28 since unsafe only at turn 19).\n- At turn 28, action U: move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 29.\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions, as all positions during the path are at safe times for their respective rows. The minimal \\(H = 10\\) because reaching \\(y = 9\\) in fewer turns (e.g., \\(H = 9\\)) would require moving up at turn 19, but this would place the player on row 1 at turn 20, which is unsafe, causing a collision.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 19: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 20: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 21: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 22: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 23: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 24: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 25: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 26: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 27: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 28: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible without colliding with any cars. The cars are on freeways y=1 to y=8, and each freeway has cars moving left or right at certain speeds.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car positions and how they move over time. The current turn is t_1 = 20. For each car, I have its head, tail, direction, and speed at turn 20. Then for future turns, I can calculate where it is based on how many turns have passed.\n\nThe collision happens only if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The player's position updates after the action, so when you move, you're on the new row only at the next turn.\n\nThe player update is: at turn t, you choose action a_t, which changes y_{t+1}. So at turn t, you are at position y_t. Then after action a_t, you move to y_{t+1} for turn t+1.\n\nCollision is checked at turn T: if y_T is between 1 and 8, and for that freeway, there is a car with 0 in its span at time T.\n\nAlso, if you move from y to y' at turn T, you are on y at turn T, and on y' at turn T+1. So you don't get hit by cars on y' at turn T, only at T+1 if you're there.\n\nNow, let's list all the cars per freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-24, 11, left, 36)\n\nSince direction left, it's moving left, so at time t, span is [h - s(t - t_1), τ - s(t - t_1)] for t > t_1. Head and tail: head is -24, tail is 11? That seems odd because if it's left-moving, head should be on the right, tail on left? Let me read the car update rules.\n\nFor left-moving: span at t_1 is [h, τ], and at T, [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIt says: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: [τ, h] → [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn this case, for freeway 1: head h=-24, tail τ=11, direction left. But if it's left-moving, and head is -24, tail 11, that means at t_1, the car spans from -24 to 11? But -24 is left of 11, so if moving left, head should be the right end, but here h=-24, τ=11, with h < τ, so if moving left, it should be [h, τ] with h left, τ right? I think I'm confused.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\nFor left-moving car: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ]\" and it moves left, so at later time, both decrease.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" and both increase.\n\nIn the notation, for left-moving, [h, τ] with h and τ such that as time increases, both decrease.\n\nBut in the value given, for freeway 1: h=-24, τ=11, so at t_1=20, span is [-24, 11]. Since direction left, it's moving left, so for example, at t=20, it covers x from -24 to 11.\n\nThen at time T, span is [-24 - s(T-20), 11 - s(T-20)] with s=36.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut the player is at x=0 always, so collision when 0 is in the span for the freeway you're on.\n\nNow, the span must contain 0 for collision.\n\nFor freeway 1 at t_1=20: span [-24,11], so 0 is between -24 and 11, yes, 0 is in [-24,11], so at turn 20, if the player is on y=1, they would collide, but player is at (0,0) at turn 20, so not on freeway yet.\n\nBut we need to avoid when moving to freeways.\n\nSimilarly, let's list all freeways:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-24, 11, left, 36) → at t, span [ -24 -36(t-20) , 11 -36(t-20) ]\n\nSet δt = t - 20, so at time t, span: left: -24 -36δt, right: 11 -36δt? Since moving left, the left end decreases, right end decreases.\n\nIn terms of x, smaller x is left, larger x is right.\n\nSo for left-moving car, at time t, min x = h - s δt, max x = τ - s δt? From the formula: Span(T) = [h - s δt, τ - s δt]\n\nWith h and τ given at t_1.\n\nFor freeway 1, h=-24, τ=11, so min x at t: -24 -36δt, max x: 11 -36δt\n\nCollision if min x <= 0 <= max x, i.e. -24 -36δt <= 0 <= 11 -36δt\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? It says \"(-24, 11, left, 36)\" for both? No, freeway 1 has one car, freeway 2 has one car with same parameters? Let me see the table:\n\n| Freeway k | Cars |\n\n| 1 | (-24, 11, left, 36) |  only one car\n\n| 2 | (-24, 11, left, 36) | one car same\n\n| 3 | (-48, -59, right, 12), (36, 25, right, 12), (0, -11, right, 12) | three cars\n\nFor right-moving, span at t_1 is [τ, h], so for each car, we have (head, tail, dir, speed), but for right-moving, head and tail are given, but span is [τ, h] meaning τ is left end, h is right end? Let's see the rule.\n\n\"Right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nSo for right-moving, at t_1, span is [τ, h], so τ is the left end, h is the right end, and both increase with time.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, [h, τ], h left, τ right, both decrease.\n\nIn the input, for a car, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed).\n\nWhat is head and tail? In the context, for left-moving, head might be the front, which is left if moving left? But in the span, it's [h, τ] for left-moving.\n\nPerhaps head and tail are not consistently defined, but from the span definition, we should use the span as given.\n\nFor freeway 3, first car: (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nDirection right, so span at t_1 is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? τ is tail, h is head? But in the tuple, it's (head, tail, dir, speed), so for this car, head = -48, tail = -59, dir=right.\n\nFor right-moving, span is [τ, h] = [tail, head] = [-59, -48] at t_1.\n\nThen at T, [ -59 +12δt, -48 +12δt ]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (36, 25, right, 12), head=36, tail=25, so span at t_1: [τ, h] = [25, 36]\n\nThird car: (0, -11, right, 12), head=0, tail=-11, span at t_1: [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nFor freeway 4 and 5, same as freeway 3? Freeway 4 has the same three cars as freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 4: \"(-48, -59, right, 12), (36, 25, right, 12), (0, -11, right, 12)\" same as freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 5 same.\n\nFreeway 6: (60, 49, right, 6)  one car\n\nDirection right, head=60, tail=49, span at t_1: [τ, h] = [49, 60]\n\nFreeway 7: (60, 49, right, 6) same as 6\n\nFreeway 8: (60, 49, right, 6), (12, 1, right, 6) two cars\n\nFirst car same as above, second car: (12, 1, right, 6), head=12, tail=1, span at t_1: [τ, h] = [1,12]\n\nNow, player starts at (0,0) at turn t=20.\n\nWe need to go to (0,9), so we need to move up to y=9.\n\ny from 0 to 9, freeways 1-8 are the dangerous rows.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars, I assume, since freeways are y=1 to 8.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), which is the top, probably safe.\n\nActions: U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), S (stay same y).\n\ny is vertical, so moving up increases y.\n\nFrom y=0 to y=9, we need to increase y by 9, so minimum moves if we go up every time, H=9 turns, but we might have to wait or detour to avoid cars.\n\nSince we can stay or even go down, but going down might not help, since we need to go up eventually.\n\nBut to avoid cars, we might need to wait on a safe row.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, but we start at y=0, need to go to y=9.\n\nThe cars move, so we need to find when each freeway is safe to be on, meaning when no car has 0 in its span at that time.\n\nFor each freeway and time, we can find if it is occupied at x=0.\n\nDefine the time from turn 20.\n\nSet t = turn number, δt = t - 20.\n\nFor each freeway, list the cars and when 0 is in their span.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: one car, left-moving, h=-24, τ=11, s=36\n\nSpan at time t: min_x = h - s δt = -24 - 36 δt\n\nMax_x = τ - s δt = 11 - 36 δt\n\n0 in span if min_x <= 0 <= max_x\n\n-24 -36δt <= 0 <= 11 -36δt\n\nSolve inequalities:\n\nLeft: -24 -36δt <= 0 => -36δt <= 24 => δt >= -24/36 = -2/3, but δt >=0 since future, so always true? Let's see.\n\n-24 -36δt <= 0 => -36δt <= 24 => divide by -36, inequality flips, δt >= -24/36 = -2/3, which is true for all δt >=0.\n\nRight: 0 <= 11 -36δt => 36δt <= 11 => δt <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305\n\nSo for δt <= 11/36, 0 is in span.\n\nSince δt integer (turns), δt = 0,1,2,... but 11/36≈0.305, so for δt=0, it is occupied.\n\nδt=0: t=20, min_x = -24, max_x=11, 0 in between, yes.\n\nδt=1: min_x = -24 -36= -60, max_x=11-36=-25, so span [-60,-25], 0 not in, since -25 <0? -25 to -60, both negative, 0 not <= max_x? max_x=-25 <0, so 0 > max_x, not in span.\n\nSimilarly, for δt>=1, min_x <= max_x <0, so 0 not in span.\n\nAt δt=0, occupied, δt>=1, not occupied.\n\nSo freeway 1 is occupied only at t=20 (δt=0), and safe for t>=21.\n\nδt=0: t=20, occupied.\n\nt=21: δt=1, min_x=-60, max_x=-25, both negative, 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly for all future t.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1, so occupied only at t=20, safe for t>=21.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-48, -59, right, 12) but head=-48, tail=-59, dir=right.\n\nFor right-moving, span at t_1: [τ, h] = [tail, head] = [-59, -48]\n\nAt time t, [ -59 + 12 δt, -48 + 12 δt ]\n\n0 in span if -59 +12δt <= 0 <= -48 +12δt\n\nSo left: -59 +12δt <= 0 => 12δt <= 59 => δt <= 59/12 ≈ 4.916, so δt <=4 since integer\n\nRight: 0 <= -48 +12δt => 48 <= 12δt => δt >= 48/12 = 4\n\nSo δt >=4 and δt <=4.916, so δt=4\n\nAt δt=4, t=24, min_x = -59 +12*4 = -59+48= -11, max_x= -48 +48=0? -48 +12*4 = -48+48=0\n\nSo span [-11,0], 0 included? Since <= max, yes, 0 <=0.\n\nAt δt=4, min_x=-11 <=0, max_x=0 >=0, so 0 in span.\n\nFor other δt, not both true. δt=4 only.\n\nNow second car on freeway 3: (36, 25, right, 12) head=36, tail=25, dir=right.\n\nSpan at t_1: [τ, h] = [25, 36]\n\nAt t: [25 +12δt, 36 +12δt]\n\n0 in span? 25 +12δt <= 0 <= 36 +12δt\n\nBut 25 +12δt >=25 >0 for δt>=0, so min_x >=25>0, so 0 < min_x, not in span. Never occupied by this car.\n\nThird car: (0, -11, right, 12) head=0, tail=-11, dir=right.\n\nSpan at t_1: [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nAt t: [ -11 +12δt, 0 +12δt ] = [-11+12δt, 12δt]\n\n0 in span if -11+12δt <= 0 <= 12δt\n\nLeft: -11+12δt <=0 => 12δt <=11 => δt <= 11/12 ≈0.916, so δt=0\n\nRight: 0 <= 12δt => δt >=0\n\nAt δt=0: min_x=-11 <=0, max_x=0 >=0, so 0 in span.\n\nFor δt>=1, min_x = -11+12δt >= -11+12=1>0 for δt=1, so min_x >0, 0 not in span.\n\nSo for freeway 3:\n\n- First car: occupied at δt=4 (t=24)\n\n- Second car: never occupied\n\n- Third car: occupied at δt=0 (t=20)\n\nSo overall, at t=20, occupied (by third car), at t=24, occupied (by first car), and other times safe? t=20 and t=24.\n\nδt=0: t=20, occupied\n\nδt=4: t=24, occupied\n\nNow for other δt, no car has 0 in span.\n\nt=20: δt=0, third car has span [-11,0], includes 0.\n\nt=24: δt=4, first car has span [-11,0], includes 0.\n\nt=21,22,23, etc., no.\n\nBut t=24 is occupied.\n\nNow freeway 4: same cars as freeway 3, so same as above: occupied at t=20 and t=24.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5: same, occupied at t=20 and t=24.\n\nNow freeway 6: one car (60,49, right,6) head=60, tail=49, dir=right.\n\nSpan at t_1: [τ, h] = [49,60]\n\nAt t: [49+6δt, 60+6δt]\n\nMin_x=49+6δt >=49>0, so 0 not in span, always safe.\n\nSimilarly freeway 7: same car, always safe.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (60,49, right,6) same as above, span [49+6δt,60+6δt] >0, never 0.\n\nSecond car: (12,1, right,6) head=12, tail=1, dir=right.\n\nSpan at t_1: [τ, h] = [1,12]\n\nAt t: [1+6δt, 12+6δt]\n\n0 in span? min_x=1+6δt >=1>0, so never 0 in span.\n\nThus freeway 8 always safe, since both cars min_x >0.\n\nSummary of occupied times for each freeway:\n\n- y=1: occupied only at t=20\n\n- y=2: occupied only at t=20\n\n- y=3: occupied at t=20 and t=24\n\n- y=4: occupied at t=20 and t=24\n\n- y=5: occupied at t=20 and t=24\n\n- y=6: never occupied\n\n- y=7: never occupied\n\n- y=8: never occupied\n\ny=6,7,8 always safe.\n\ny=1 and 2 safe except t=20\n\ny=3,4,5 safe except t=20 and t=24\n\nNow player starts at t=20, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=0 and y=9 are safe, we can be there anytime.\n\nNow, to move up, we need to go through the freeways.\n\nEach action changes y by +1, -1, or 0.\n\nWe need to go from y=0 to y=9, so net +9 in y.\n\nMinimal turns: if no obstacles, we can go up every turn, 9 turns, but we need to avoid the occupied times.\n\nAt t=20, if we go to y=1 immediately, we might be on y=1 at t=21? Let's think carefully about timing.\n\nAt turn t=20, player is at (0,0). We choose action a_{20}.\n\nAfter action, at turn t=21, player is at y_{21} = y_{20} + Δy, depending on a_{20}.\n\nCollision is checked at each turn T, for the position y_T.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T, and if y_T between 1 and 8, we check if at that turn, for that freeway, 0 is occupied.\n\nFor example, at t=20, we are at y=0, which is not a freeway, so no collision.\n\nIf we choose to go up at t=20, a_{20}=U, then at t=21, we are at y=1.\n\nNow at t=21, we are on y=1, and we need to check if freeway 1 is occupied at t=21.\n\nFrom above, for y=1, occupied only at t=20, so at t=21, it is safe. Similarly, if we stay or down, but we need to go up.\n\nSimilarly, if we go to y=1 at t=21, it is safe.\n\nBut at t=20, if we go to y=1 at t=21, we are not on freeway at t=20, so no issue.\n\nNow, the problem is at certain times, some rows are occupied.\n\nSpecifically, at t=20, all y=1,2,3,4,5 are occupied? y=1 and y=2 occupied at t=20, y=3,4,5 also occupied at t=20.\n\nBut since we start at y=0 at t=20, we are safe.\n\nIf we want to enter a freeway at turn T, we need that at that turn T, it is not occupied.\n\nFor example, to be on y=1 at turn T, we need y=1 not occupied at T.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow, y=1 is occupied only at t=20, so for t>=21, it is safe to be on y=1.\n\nSimilarly y=2: occupied only at t=20, safe for t>=21.\n\ny=3: occupied at t=20 and t=24, so safe for t not 20 or 24, i.e., t=21,22,23,25,... etc.\n\nSimilarly for y=4 and y=5.\n\ny=6,7,8 always safe.\n\nWe need to go from y=0 to y=9 in min turns.\n\nStart at t=20, y=0.\n\nWe can choose to move up, down, or stay.\n\nSince we need to go up, and lower rows have restrictions, but y=1 and y=2 are safe after t=20.\n\ny=3,4,5 have danger at t=24.\n\nt=24 is in the future.\n\nNow, min turns: if we go up every turn, we can reach in 9 turns.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on y=3,4, or 5 at t=24.\n\nLet's simulate.\n\nOption: go straight up.\n\nStart t=20, y=0, action U, then t=21, y=1\n\nAt t=21, y=1: freeway 1, occupied only at t=20, so t=21 safe. Action U, t=22, y=2\n\nt=22, y=2: safe, since occupied only t=20. Action U, t=23, y=3\n\nt=23, y=3: now y=3 occupied at t=20 and t=24, not t=23, so safe. Action U, t=24, y=4\n\nt=24, y=4: but at t=24, y=4 is occupied! Because y=4 occupied at t=24.\n\nCollision.\n\nCannot be on y=4 at t=24.\n\nSimilarly, if we are on y=5 at t=24, same problem.\n\nOr on y=3 at t=24, also occupied.\n\nIn the sequence above, at t=24, we are on y=4, which is occupied.\n\nWe need to avoid being on y=3,4,5 at t=24.\n\nt=24 is the critical time.\n\nWe can either not be on those rows at t=24, or delay so that we pass before or after.\n\nSince y=3,4,5 are safe except at t=20 and t=24, and t=20 is past, so only t=24 is issue.\n\nt=20 is the start, we are not on them.\n\nSo for t=24, we must not be on y=3,4, or 5.\n\nWe can be on y=0,1,2,6,7,8,9 at t=24, all safe.\n\nIn the min path, we might need to wait or go faster/slower.\n\nSince we start from y=0, and need to go up, we can try to reach higher rows before t=24 or after.\n\nt=24 is 4 turns from now, since t=20, δt=4 for t=24.\n\nt=20 to t=24 is 4 turns later.\n\nAt t=20, y=0.\n\nAfter one action, t=21, y=1 (if U)\n\nAfter two, t=22, y=2\n\nAfter three, t=23, y=3\n\nAfter four, t=24, y=4\n\nAs above.\n\nTo avoid being on y=3,4,5 at t=24, we could:\n\n- Be above y=5 by t=24\n\n- Be below y=3 at t=24\n\n- Or on y=3,4,5 but not at t=24, but since we have to pass through, we need to be there at safe times.\n\nFor example, we can be on y=3 at t=23, which is safe, or at t=25, etc.\n\nSimilarly for y=4 and 5.\n\nBut in the straight path, we are on y=4 at t=24, which is bad.\n\nWe need to adjust the timing.\n\nOption 1: Go faster to higher rows.\n\nBut we can only go up one per turn, so from y=0 at t=20, we can be at y=4 at t=24 earliest, but that is bad.\n\nAt t=24, y=4 is bad.\n\nWe can be at y=5 at t=24? t=20 y=0, t=21 y=1, t=22 y=2, t=23 y=3, t=24 y=4, cannot be y=5 at t=24 from start.\n\nMax y at t=24 is y=4 if start from 0 with all U.\n\nMin y=0 if all S, but not helpful.\n\nTo be above y=5 at t=24, we need to be at least y=6.\n\nBut from y=0, in 4 turns, with all U, we can only reach y=4 at t=24.\n\nCannot reach y=6 by t=24.\n\nt=20: y=0\n\nt=21: y=1\n\nt=22: y=2\n\nt=23: y=3\n\nt=24: y=4\n\ny=4 at t=24.\n\nTo be at y=6 at t=24, we need to gain 6 in 4 turns, but each U gains 1, so impossible, max gain is 4, to y=4.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=5, impossible.\n\nSo at t=24, we must be at y<=4 if we go up, but y=4 is occupied, y=3 also occupied at t=24, y=2 is safe? y=2 occupied only at t=20, so for t=24, y=2 is safe.\n\nSimilarly y=1 safe, y=0 safe, y=6,7,8 safe.\n\nBut y=3,4,5 occupied at t=24.\n\nSo at t=24, we can be on y=0,1,2,6,7,8.\n\nBut since we start from y=0 and go to y=9, if we are at y=2 at t=24, we can go up later.\n\nOr if we can be at y=6, but we cannot reach y=6 by t=24 from start.\n\nWe must be at y<=4 at t=24.\n\nThe safe y at t=24 are y=0,1,2,6,7,8 but y=6,7,8 not reachable, so only y=0,1,2 possible at t=24.\n\ny=1 and y=2 are safe at t=24.\n\nNow, from start, we can be at y=2 at t=24 by going up slower or staying.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt t=20, y=0, action S (stay), then t=21, y=0\n\nThen action U, t=22, y=1\n\nAction U, t=23, y=2\n\nAction S, t=24, y=2\n\nAt t=24, y=2, which is safe.\n\nThen from there, we need to go to y=9.\n\ny=2 to y=9, need 7 more ups.\n\nBut we need to go through y=3,4,5 which have the t=24 danger, but t=24 is over, so for t>24, y=3,4,5 are safe except we need to avoid t=24, which is past.\n\ny=3,4,5 occupied only at t=20 and t=24, so for t>24, they are safe.\n\nt=25 onwards, all freeways are safe except y=1 and 2 which were safe after t=20, but y=1 and 2 safe for t>=21.\n\nSo after t=24, all y=1 to 8 are safe.\n\ny=1: safe for t>=21\n\ny=2: safe for t>=21\n\ny=3: safe for t not 20 or 24, so t=21,22,23,25,... so after t=24, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=4 and y=5.\n\ny=6,7,8 always safe.\n\nSo from t=25 onwards, all rows safe.\n\nNow, back to the plan.\n\nWe can be at y=2 at t=24, safe.\n\nThen from t=24, y=2, we can go up to y=9.\n\nEach U increases y by one, so from y=2 to y=9, need 7 actions: U,U,U,U,U,U,U to reach y=9 at t=24 +7 = t=31.\n\nt=24: y=2\n\nAction U, t=25: y=3\n\nSince t=25>24, y=3 safe.\n\nAction U, t=26: y=4 safe\n\nU, t=27: y=5 safe\n\nU, t=28: y=6 safe\n\nU, t=29: y=7 safe\n\nU, t=30: y=8 safe\n\nU, t=31: y=9\n\nReached at t=31.\n\nTotal turns from t=20: from t=20 to t=31, 11 turns? Let's see the sequence.\n\nStart t=20: y=0\n\nWe need actions from t=20 to when we reach y=9.\n\nIn this plan:\n\nt=20: action S? Earlier I said action S at t=20 to stay at y=0 for t=21.\n\nt=20: choose a_{20}, then y_{21} = y_0 + Δy\n\nSet actions:\n\nAt turn t=20: action S, so Δy=0, then at t=21, y=0\n\nThen at t=21: action U, so at t=22, y=1\n\nAt t=22: action U, so at t=23, y=2\n\nAt t=23: action S? To stay at y=2 for t=24.\n\nAt t=23: y=2, choose action for t=24.\n\nIf we choose S at t=23, then at t=24, y=2.\n\nIf we choose U at t=23, then at t=24, y=3, which is occupied, bad.\n\nSo at t=23, we need to be at y=2 and not move up, or be lower.\n\nBut in this case, at t=23, y=2, we choose S, so at t=24, y=2.\n\nThen at t=24: action U, so at t=25, y=3\n\nThen U at t=24? Actions at each turn.\n\nTurn t: choose a_t, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nAt turn t, we are at y_t, choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nFor collision at turn T, it depends on y_T.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\n- Turn t=20: y=0, choose a_{20}. To have y=0 at t=21, choose S. Then at t=21, y=0\n\n- Turn t=21: y=0, choose U, then at t=22, y=1\n\n- Turn t=22: y=1, choose U, then at t=23, y=2\n\n- Turn t=23: y=2, choose S (to stay), then at t=24, y=2\n\n- Turn t=24: y=2, choose U, then at t=25, y=3\n\n- Turn t=25: y=3, choose U, then at t=26, y=4\n\n- Turn t=26: y=4, choose U, then at t=27, y=5\n\n- Turn t=27: y=5, choose U, then at t=28, y=6\n\n- Turn t=28: y=6, choose U, then at t=29, y=7\n\n- Turn t=29: y=7, choose U, then at t=30, y=8\n\n- Turn t=30: y=8, choose U, then at t=31, y=9\n\nNow at t=31, y=9, reached.\n\nTotal actions from t=20 to t=30, 11 actions? Turns: actions at t=20 to t=30, that's 11 actions, but H should be the number of turns including from start.\n\nThe sequence of actions: from t=20 to t=20+H-1, and after H actions, we are at y=9 at turn t=20 + H -1 + something.\n\nDefine.\n\nAfter H actions, we have performed actions at t=20, t=21, ..., up to t=20 + H -1.\n\nThen the position after H actions is at turn t=20 + H.\n\nBecause: at turn t=20, before action, y=0.\n\nAfter first action (at t=20), we are at turn t=21 with new y.\n\nAfter second action (at t=21), turn t=22, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, we are at turn t=20 + k.\n\nAnd y_{20+k} is the position.\n\nWe want y_{20 + H} = 9.\n\nIn the sequence above, after how many actions?\n\nStart: before actions, t=20, y=0\n\nAfter action 1 (t=20): t=21, y=0 (if S)\n\nAfter action 2 (t=21): t=22, y=1 (U)\n\nAfter action 3 (t=22): t=23, y=2 (U)\n\nAfter action 4 (t=23): t=24, y=2 (S)\n\nAfter action 5 (t=24): t=25, y=3 (U)\n\nAfter action 6 (t=25): t=26, y=4 (U)\n\nAfter action 7 (t=26): t=27, y=5 (U)\n\nAfter action 8 (t=27): t=28, y=6 (U)\n\nAfter action 9 (t=28): t=29, y=7 (U)\n\nAfter action 10 (t=29): t=30, y=8 (U)\n\nAfter action 11 (t=30): t=31, y=9 (U)\n\nSo after 11 actions, at t=31, y=9.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut we can do better? 11 turns seem long.\n\nMinimal is 9, but we had to wait.\n\nSince y=6,7,8 are always safe, we could go directly to them faster, but we have to go through the lower rows.\n\nAnother idea: at t=20, we go up to y=1 immediately, but y=1 is occupied at t=20, but at t=20 we are at y=0, not on freeway.\n\nIf we choose U at t=20, then at t=21, y=1, which is safe since t=21 not occupied.\n\nThen we can go up.\n\nBut we need to avoid t=24 on y=3,4,5.\n\nAt t=21, y=1\n\nt=22, y=2 if U\n\nt=23, y=3 if U\n\nBut at t=24, if we go to y=4, bad.\n\nSo at t=23, y=3, we can choose not to move up, or move down, but moving down not efficient.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=20: action U, t=21, y=1\n\nt=21: action U, t=22, y=2\n\nt=22: action U, t=23, y=3\n\nNow at t=23, y=3, which is safe since occupied only t=20 and t=24, not t=23.\n\nBut if we choose U at t=23, t=24 y=4, occupied, bad.\n\nSo we must not choose U at t=23.\n\nWe can choose S or D.\n\nIf choose S at t=23, then t=24 y=3, but y=3 occupied at t=24, so collision.\n\nIf choose D, then t=24 y=2, which is safe.\n\nThen at t=24, y=2, safe.\n\nThen from there go up.\n\nSequence:\n\nt=20: U, t=21 y=1\n\nt=21: U, t=22 y=2\n\nt=22: U, t=23 y=3\n\nt=23: D (down), t=24 y=2  // down to avoid being on y=3 at t=24\n\nBut y=2 at t=24 is safe.\n\nThen t=24: U, t=25 y=3\n\nt=25: U, t=26 y=4\n\netc.\n\nBut we went down and up, which cost extra.\n\nIn terms of net y, we gained to y=3 then down to y=2, so from y=2 at t=24, same as before.\n\nThen to y=9, need 7 ups.\n\nTotal actions: t=20 U, t=21 U, t=22 U, t=23 D, t=24 U, t=25 U, ..., to y=9 at t=31? Let's count.\n\nAfter t=23 D: t=24 y=2\n\nThen t=24 U: t=25 y=3\n\nt=25 U: t=26 y=4\n\nt=26 U: t=27 y=5\n\nt=27 U: t=28 y=6\n\nt=28 U: t=29 y=7\n\nt=29 U: t=30 y=8\n\nt=30 U: t=31 y=9\n\nSame as before, 11 actions to reach at t=31.\n\nBut in the first plan, we had an extra stay at beginning.\n\nIn first plan: t=20 S, t=21 y=0; then U to y=2 at t=23; S to stay at t=24 y=2; then up.\n\nIn second: we went to y=3 then down to y=2 at t=24.\n\nBoth have y=2 at t=24, then up to y=9 at t=31.\n\nBut in the down-up, we used one extra action to go down and up, but in the first plan, we had a stay at t=20.\n\nIn terms of number of actions, both have 11 actions to reach y=9 at t=31.\n\nt=20 to t=30 actions, 11 actions.\n\nBut we can reach earlier if we can be higher at t=24, but we cannot.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6,7,8 are always safe, and we can be on them earlier, but to get to y=6, we need to go through y=3,4,5.\n\nAt t=24, we must be on y=0,1, or 2.\n\ny=0 is safe, but if we stay at y=0 longer, it takes more time.\n\nFor example, if we start at t=20, go to y=1 at t=21, then to y=2 at t=22, then we could stay at y=2 until after t=24.\n\nAt t=22, y=2, we can stay multiple turns.\n\nBut staying doesn't help, we need to go up.\n\nThe earliest we can be at y=2 is t=22: t=20 U, t=21 y=1; t=21 U, t=22 y=2.\n\nThen at t=22, y=2, we can choose to stay: t=22 S, t=23 y=2; then t=23 S, t=24 y=2; then at t=24 U, t=25 y=3, etc.\n\nBut we stayed at y=2 for two turns, which is unnecessary; we can go up at t=22 to y=3, but at t=23 y=3 is safe, then we have to avoid t=24.\n\nIf at t=22 we go U to y=3 at t=23, safe, then at t=23 we must not be on y=3 or higher at t=24, so we have to go down or stay, but staying at y=3 at t=24 bad, so go down to y=2 at t=24.\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo we cannot avoid having to be at y=2 or lower at t=24.\n\nThen from y=2 at t=24, it takes 7 more turns to y=9.\n\nReach at t=31.\n\nBut total turns from start: at t=20, after 0 actions, y=0.\n\nAfter H actions, at t=20+H, y=9.\n\nIn 11 actions: from t=20 to t=30 actions, t=31 y=9.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut is there a way with less?\n\nSuppose we go up faster to y=3 before t=24, but we can be at y=3 at t=23.\n\nAt t=23, y=3 is safe.\n\nBut we cannot stay there because t=24 it is occupied.\n\nSo we have to leave before t=24.\n\nFrom y=3 at t=23, we can only go to y=2, y=3, or y=4 at t=24.\n\ny=3 and y=4 occupied, so only to y=2 or y=4? To y=2: if we choose D at t=23, t=24 y=2 safe.\n\nTo y=4: U, but occupied.\n\nOr stay, occupied.\n\nSo only down to y=2.\n\nSimilarly, if we are at y=4 at t=23, which we can be: t=20 U t=21 y=1; t=21 U t=22 y=2; t=22 U t=23 y=3; then t=23 U? But t=23 U would be to y=4 at t=24, which is bad, and at t=23 we are at y=3.\n\nTo be at y=4 at t=23: t=20 U t=21 y=1; t=21 U t=22 y=2; but to y=4 at t=23, need from y=2 at t=22 to y=4 at t=23? Impossible, one action only to y=3 max.\n\nAt t=22, y=2, after action at t=22, to y_{23} = y2 + Δy, so y=1,2,3 at t=23.\n\nCannot be y=4 at t=23.\n\nSimilarly, min y at t=23 is y=0 if we go down, but not helpful.\n\nSo possible positions at t=23: y=0,1,2,3.\n\nAt t=23, y=3 is safe, as above.\n\nBut at t=24, we need to be not on y=3,4,5.\n\nSo from y=3 at t=23, we can go to y=2 at t=24 (D), or y=3 (S) bad, or y=4 (U) bad.\n\nSo only to y=2.\n\nIf we are at y=2 at t=23, we can go to y=1,2,3 at t=24.\n\ny=3 bad, so to y=1 or y=2.\n\ny=1 and y=2 both safe at t=24.\n\nSimilarly, if at y=1 or y=0.\n\nBut to minimize time, better to be higher.\n\nSo at t=24, best to be at y=2.\n\nThen proceed up.\n\nNow, to reach y=2 at t=24 with minimal actions.\n\nFrom start, we can be at y=2 at t=22 with two U: t=20 U, t=21 y=1; t=21 U, t=22 y=2.\n\nThen we need to stay until t=24.\n\nAt t=22, y=2, choose S at t=22, so t=23 y=2; then S at t=23, t=24 y=2.\n\nThen from t=24, go up.\n\nt=24 U, t=25 y=3\n\nt=25 U, t=26 y=4\n\n...\n\nto t=30 U, t=31 y=9? From y=2 to y=9, 7 ups.\n\nActions: t=20 U, t=21 U, t=22 S, t=23 S, t=24 U, t=25 U, ..., up to t=30 U for y=9 at t=31.\n\nt=30 U, t=31 y=9.\n\nActions at t=20 to t=30, 11 actions.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAt t=22, after reaching y=2, we could go up to y=3 at t=23, but then we have to go down at t=23 to y=2 at t=24, which is worse: extra down and up.\n\nFor example: t=20 U, t=21 y=1; t=21 U, t=22 y=2; t=22 U, t=23 y=3; then t=23 D, t=24 y=2; then t=24 U, etc. to y=9 at t=31 with one extra action (the D).\n\nWorse.\n\nSo best to stay at y=2 for two turns if necessary.\n\nBut in this case, we stay from t=22 to t=24 at y=2.\n\nt=22: after action U at t=21, we are at y=2 at t=22.\n\nThen at turn t=22, we choose action, if S, then t=23 y=2; then at t=23, choose S, t=24 y=2.\n\nThen up.\n\nBut we can reduce the stay.\n\nSince we need to be at y=2 at t=24, and we can reach y=2 by t=22, we must stay two turns, but we can reach later.\n\nFor example, start with S at t=20, t=21 y=0; then U at t=21, t=22 y=1; then U at t=22, t=23 y=2; then at t=23, to have y=2 at t=24, choose S, t=24 y=2.\n\nThen same, but we started with a stay, so we reach y=2 at t=23 instead of t=22.\n\nIn this case: t=20 S, t=21 y=0; t=21 U, t=22 y=1; t=22 U, t=23 y=2; t=23 S, t=24 y=2; then t=24 U, t=25 y=3; ... to t=30 U, t=31 y=9.\n\nSame 11 actions.\n\nIf we start with U at t=20, t=21 y=1; then we can go to y=2 at t=22 with U at t=21; then stay at y=2 for t=23 and t=24.\n\nt=21: y=1, choose U, t=22 y=2\n\nt=22: y=2, choose S, t=23 y=2\n\nt=23: y=2, choose S, t=24 y=2\n\nThen t=24 U, etc.\n\nStill, from t=24 y=2 to t=31 y=9, 7 ups, plus actions to get to y=2 by t=22: two U, and two S to stay, total actions to reach y=9: 2 (to y=2) + 2 (stay) + 7 (up) = 11 actions.\n\nThe two S are the stays at t=22 and t? In the actions: actions at t=20 U, t=21 U, t=22 S, t=23 S, t=24 U, ..., t=30 U.\n\nYes 11 actions.\n\nBut to reach y=9 faster, we need to start going up earlier or something.\n\nSince y=6,7,8 are always safe, we can go to them directly after t=24.\n\nBut we have to pass through y=3,4,5 after t=24, which is safe.\n\nThe bottleneck is to avoid t=24 on middle rows.\n\nAnother idea: can we be on y=5 or higher before t=24? But we can only be at y=4 at t=24 max, which is bad.\n\ny=4 at t=24 occupied.\n\nSo impossible to be on y=5 at t=24.\n\nSo we must be below y=3 at t=24, i.e., y<=2.\n\nThen the fastest is to be at y=2 at t=24 with as few actions as possible, but since we start from y=0, and y=2 at t=24, we can achieve that with 2 up actions and possibly stays.\n\nMin actions to be at y=2 at t=24: we can have two U and two S, or other combinations, but min actions is 2, but over 4 turns, so we need to fill with S or D, but D not helpful.\n\nFor example, to be at y=2 at t=24, we need net +2 in y from t=20 to t=24.\n\nWith 4 actions, we can have, e.g., U,U,S,S or U,S,U,S etc., all take 2 U and 2 S, or if we have D, it requires more U, worse.\n\nSo min 2 actions to gain the y, but we have 4 turns, so we must have 2 S or something.\n\nThe number of actions is fixed for the turns: from t=20 to t=24, there are 4 actions: at t=20,21,22,23 for y at t=24.\n\ny at t=24 is determined by actions at t=20,21,22,23.\n\nStart y_20=0.\n\nAfter a_20, y_21 = 0 + Δy20\n\nAfter a_21, y_22 = y_21 + Δy21\n\nAfter a_22, y_23 = y_22 + Δy22\n\nAfter a_23, y_24 = y_23 + Δy23\n\nWe want y_24=2.\n\nAnd for safety, we need to avoid collision during, but at t=24 we are at y=2 safe, and for previous turns, we need to ensure no collision at those turns.\n\nFor example, at t=21, if we are on y=1, it must be safe, which it is for t>=21.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo to have y_24=2 with min actions, but we have to perform actions each turn, so we must choose 4 actions such that the net Δy sums to +2.\n\nEach U: +1, D: -1, S:0.\n\nSo to have sum of Δy from t=20 to t=23 for y_24.\n\ny_24 = y_20 + Δy20 + Δy21 + Δy22 + Δy23 = 0 + sum_{i=20}^{23} Δy_i\n\nSet to 2.\n\nSo sum_{i=20}^{23} Δy_i = 2.\n\nEach Δy is -1,0,1.\n\nSo for example, two U and two S: U,U,S,S or U,S,U,S etc.\n\nOr one U and three S? Sum=1, y_24=1, not 2.\n\nOr three U and one D: sum=3-1=2, but more actions, not minimal.\n\nSo min way is two U and two S.\n\nThen y_24=2.\n\nThen from there, we need to go to y=9, which requires 7 more U actions.\n\nSo total actions: 4 for up to t=24 plus 7 to y=9, but the actions to y=9 are from t=24 onwards.\n\nAfter setting y_24=2, we perform actions at t=24,25,..., to reach y=9.\n\nAt t=24, we are at y=2.\n\nThen we choose a_24, a_25, ..., up to when y=9.\n\nWith each U, we increase y.\n\nAfter k actions from t=24, y_{24+k} = 2 + k, if all U.\n\nSet to 9 when 2+k=9, k=7.\n\nSo actions at t=24 to t=30, 7 actions, y at t=31=9.\n\nNow the actions before: to have y_24=2, we have actions at t=20,21,22,23: four actions.\n\nTotal actions: 4 + 7 = 11, from t=20 to t=30, 11 actions.\n\nt=20 to t=23: 4 actions for y_24=2\n\nt=24 to t=30: 7 actions for to y_31=9\n\nTotal 11 actions.\n\nThe sequence includes actions at t=20 to t=30.\n\nNow, in terms of H, the number of turns: we start at t=20, after H actions, at t=20+H, y=9.\n\nAfter H actions, we are at turn t=20+H.\n\nSet y_{20+H} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, at t=31, y=9, so 20+H=31, H=11.\n\nBut is H=11 minimal? Probably, since we have to waste some time at low levels.\n\nPerhaps we can reach y=9 earlier by not staying but going faster after t=24.\n\nBut after t=24, we can go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut from y=2 at t=24 to y=9 at t=31, min 7 turns.\n\nWe could have been higher at t=24, but we cannot, max y=2.\n\nAnother thought: since y=3 is safe at t=23, we can be there, but we have to leave before t=24, so we go down, which sets us back.\n\nFor example, suppose we go to y=3 at t=23: t=20 U, t=21 y=1; t=21 U, t=22 y=2; t=22 U, t=23 y=3.\n\nThen at t=23, to avoid t=24 on y=3, we go down: t=23 D, t=24 y=2.\n\nThen at t=24, y=2, then go up: t=24 U, t=25 y=3; etc. to y=9 at t=31.\n\nBut we have an extra D action, so total actions: to reach y=3 at t=23: 3 actions (U,U,U at t=20,21,22), then D at t=23, then U from t=24 to t=30: 7 actions, total 3+1+7=11 actions, same.\n\nAnd we have collision risk? At t=23, y=3, which is safe, no issue.\n\nBut same H.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=5 or something later, but no benefit.\n\nSo minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach in 10.\n\nSuppose H=10, then at t=30, y=9.\n\nSo y_{30} =9.\n\nSince y_{20}=0, we need net +9 in 10 actions.\n\nEach action changes y by at most +1, so possible only if all U, but we cannot because of t=24.\n\nIf all U: t=20 U, t=21 y=1; t=21 U, t=22 y=2; t=22 U, t=23 y=3; t=23 U, t=24 y=4; but at t=24 y=4 occupied, collision.\n\nIf we do something else, we miss some up, so y at t=30 less than 10 if not all U.\n\nMax y at t=30 is 10 if all U from start, but we cannot due to collision.\n\nWith H=10 actions, y_{30} <=10, but to be 9, possible if one S or D.\n\nBut at t=24, we must not be on y=3,4,5.\n\nIf all U, we are at y=4 at t=24.\n\nTo avoid, we need to be lower at some point.\n\nFor example, suppose we have one S or D before.\n\nSay, at some point we do S or D, so that at t=24 we are at y=2 or less.\n\nFor example, suppose t=20 S, t=21 y=0; then all U: t=21 U, t=22 y=1; t=22 U, t=23 y=2; t=23 U, t=24 y=3; but y=3 at t=24 occupied, bad.\n\nt=20 U, t=21 y=1; t=21 S, t=22 y=1; t=22 U, t=23 y=2; t=23 U, t=24 y=3; again bad.\n\nt=20 U, t=21 y=1; t=21 U, t=22 y=2; t=22 S, t=23 y=2; t=23 U, t=24 y=3; bad.\n\nTo be at y=2 at t=24, we need the actions to sum Δy to +2 over 4 actions.\n\nThen from t=24 to t=30, 6 actions, y_{30} = y_{24} + sum Δy from t=24 to t=29.\n\ny_{24}=2, then after 6 actions, y_{30} <= 2+6=8, which is less than 9.\n\ny_{30} = y_{24} + Δy24 + Δy25 + Δy26 + Δy27 + Δy28 + Δy29\n\nMax 2 +6=8 if all U, but we need y_{30}=9, so impossible with y_{24}=2.\n\nIf y_{24}=1, then y_{30} <=1+6=7<9.\n\ny_{24}=0, worse.\n\nSo with H=10 actions, y_{30} <= y_{24} +6, and y_{24} <=2 (since must be <=2 to be safe), so y_{30} <=8<9, cannot reach y=9.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11, with y_{31}=9.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to specify the actions.\n\nNow, to have a sequence, we can choose one with minimal H=11.\n\nFor example, one way: all actions to go directly with waits.\n\nSince y=6,7,8 are safe, but we don't need to rush.\n\nIn the sequence, after t=24, we go up continuously.\n\nNow, for the actions before t=24, we need to have y_{24}=2 with sum Δy=2 over four actions.\n\nAnd no collision during.\n\nFor example, at t=20: we can do U or S.\n\nIf we do U at t=20, t=21 y=1, which is safe (t=21>=21).\n\nThen at t=21, if we do U, t=22 y=2, safe.\n\nThen at t=22, to stay, do S, t=23 y=2, safe.\n\nThen at t=23, do S, t=24 y=2, safe.\n\nThen from t=24: U, U, U, U, U, U, U to y=9.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn t_1 = 20: action U\n\nThen turn 21: action U\n\nTurn 22: action S\n\nTurn 23: action S\n\nTurn 24: action U\n\nTurn 25: action U\n\nTurn 26: action U\n\nTurn 27: action U\n\nTurn 28: action U\n\nTurn 29: action U\n\nTurn 30: action U\n\nAt turn 30, after action U, y_{31} = y_{30} +1? Let's see positions.\n\nAt turn 20: before action, y=0, choose a_{20}=U, so after, at turn 21, y=1\n\nTurn 21: y=1, choose a_{21}=U, so at turn 22, y=2\n\nTurn 22: y=2, choose a_{22}=S, so at turn 23, y=2\n\nTurn 23: y=2, choose a_{23}=S, so at turn 24, y=2\n\nTurn 24: y=2, choose a_{24}=U, so at turn 25, y=3\n\nTurn 25: y=3, choose a_{25}=U, so at turn 26, y=4\n\nTurn 26: y=4, choose a_{26}=U, so at turn 27, y=5\n\nTurn 27: y=5, choose a_{27}=U, so at turn 28, y=6\n\nTurn 28: y=6, choose a_{28}=U, so at turn 29, y=7\n\nTurn 29: y=7, choose a_{29}=U, so at turn 30, y=8\n\nTurn 30: y=8, choose a_{30}=U, so at turn 31, y=9\n\nReached.\n\nActions from t=20 to t=30, 11 actions.\n\nWe could start with S, but it might delay, same H.\n\nIn the answer, we need to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the sequence, at turn 22 and 23, we have S actions, which are fine.\n\nTo make it shorter, but H=11 is minimal.\n\nAnother sequence: we could go to y=3 earlier and down, but same H.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n\nNow, in the car states, for freeway 8, it has cars, but we said always safe, but let's confirm when we go through.\n\nIn this sequence, we go to y=8 at turn 30? At turn 30, we are at y=8, and choose U to go to y=9.\n\nAt turn 30, y=8, which is freeway, but we said freeway 8 always safe, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nIn the sequence above, we are on y=3 at turn 25, which is after t=24, safe.\n\ny=4 at turn 26, safe, etc.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nWe need to output actions from t=20 to t=20+H-1, with H=11, so t=20 to t=30.\n\nEach turn with action.\n\nIn the sequence I have:\n\nTurn 20: U\n\nTurn 21: U\n\nTurn 22: S\n\nTurn 23: S\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: U\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nBut at turn 30, we do U to go to y=9 at turn 31.\n\nIn the sequence, the last action is at turn 30.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut let's see if we can reduce S actions.\n\nFor example, instead of two S, we can have different, but same number.\n\nSuppose at t=20 U, t=21 y=1\n\nt=21 U, t=22 y=2\n\nThen at t=22, instead of S, we could do nothing, but we have to choose action.\n\nSince y=2 is safe, we can stay.\n\nBut we need to be at y=2 at t=24, so we must not move up at t=22 or t=23 if we are at y=2.\n\nIf at t=22 we do U, we go to y=3 at t=23, then we have to go down at t=23 to y=2 at t=24.\n\nBut that adds a D, which is extra.\n\nFor example: t=20 U, t=21 y=1\n\nt=21 U, t=22 y=2\n\nt=22 U, t=23 y=3  // safe\n\nt=23 D, t=24 y=2  // down to avoid\n\nThen t=24 U, t=25 y=3\n\n...\n\nto t=30 U, t=31 y=9\n\nBut actions: t=20 U, t=21 U, t=22 U, t=23 D, t=24 U, ..., t=30 U\n\nNow, compared to previous, we have U,U,U,D,U,U,U,U,U,U,U\n\n11 actions, but one D and one extra U? From t=24 to t=30: t=24 U (y=3), t=25 U (y=4), ..., t=30 U (y=9), that's 7 U from t=24 to t=30.\n\nt=24 U: to y=3 at t=25\n\nList:\n\nAfter t=23 D: t=24 y=2\n\nt=24 U: t=25 y=3\n\nt=25 U: t=26 y=4\n\nt=26 U: t=27 y=5\n\nt=27 U: t=28 y=6\n\nt_{28} U: t_{29} y=7\n\nt_{29} U: t_{30} y=8\n\nt_{30} U: t_{31} y=9\n\nActions: t=20 U, t=21 U, t=22 U, t=23 D, t=24 U, t=25 U, t=26 U, t=27 U, t=28 U, t_{29} U, t_{30} U\n\nThat's 11 actions, but we have a D, which might be considered worse, but in terms of number, same.\n\nIn the first sequence, we have two S, which are neutral.\n\nPerhaps S is better than D, but both acceptable.\n\nI think the first sequence with S is fine.\n\nNow, in the output, we need to write for each turn.\n\nAlso, in the car states, for freeway 8, it has a car (12,1,right,6), which at t_1=20, span [1,12], and moving right, so min x increasing, always greater than 0, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nNow, the minimal H is 11.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), which we do at turn 31.\n\nNow, answer format.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 20: U\nTurn 21: U\nTurn 22: S\nTurn 23: S\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: U\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: U\n}\n\nIn the sequence, turn 20 to turn 30, actions.\n\nAfter last action at turn 30, at turn 31, y=9.\n\nThe sequence is for t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1=20, H=11, so t from 20 to 30.\n\nYes.\n\nTo write in the box.\n\nBut in the action, for turn 22 and 23, S, which is stay.\n\nPerhaps we can have only one S, but I don't think so.\n\nAnother sequence: start with S at t=20, then U at t=21 to y=1 at t=22? t=20 S, t=21 y=0; t=21 U, t=22 y=1; t=22 U, t=23 y=2; t=23 S, t=24 y=2; then same as before.\n\nBut we have S at t=20 and S at t=23, same.\n\nNo better.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the sequence.\n</think>\nTo reach the position (0, 9) from (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 20\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars, the following sequence of actions is determined. The minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 11, meaning the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 31 after performing actions from turn 20 to turn 30.\n\n### Key Constraints and Reasoning:\n- **Player Movement**: The player starts at (0, 0) at turn 20. Actions \\(a_t \\in \\{U, D, S\\}\\) change the vertical position: \\(U\\) increases \\(y\\) by 1, \\(D\\) decreases \\(y\\) by 1, and \\(S\\) keeps \\(y\\) unchanged. The goal is to reach \\(y = 9\\).\n- **Collision Avoidance**: Collision occurs if, at any turn \\(T\\), the player is on a freeway \\(y \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 8\\}\\) and \\(x = 0\\) is within the span of any car on that freeway at turn \\(T\\).\n- **Car Occupancy Summary (based on given car states)**:\n  - Freeways 1 and 2: Occupied only at turn 20. Safe for \\(t \\geq 21\\).\n  - Freeways 3, 4, and 5: Occupied at turns 20 and 24. Safe for \\(t \\notin \\{20, 24\\}\\).\n  - Freeways 6, 7, and 8: Never occupied (always safe).\n- **Critical Turn \\(t = 24\\)**: Freeways 3, 4, and 5 are occupied at turn 24. The player must not be on \\(y = 3, 4,\\) or \\(5\\) at turn 24 to avoid collision.\n- **Feasibility**:\n  - By turn 24, the player can be at most at \\(y = 4\\) if moving up continuously from turn 20, but \\(y = 4\\) is occupied at turn 24.\n  - The only safe positions at turn 24 are \\(y \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8\\}\\). However, reaching \\(y \\geq 6\\) by turn 24 is impossible from \\(y = 0\\) in 4 turns (maximum reachable \\(y\\) is 4).\n  - Thus, the player must be at \\(y \\leq 2\\) at turn 24. The highest safe position is \\(y = 2\\).\n  - To be at \\(y = 2\\) at turn 24, the net change in \\(y\\) from turn 20 to turn 23 must be \\(+2\\), requiring two \\(U\\) actions and two \\(S\\) actions over turns 20–23.\n  - After turn 24, all freeways are safe (as \\(t > 24\\)), and the player can move up continuously to reach \\(y = 9\\).\n- **Minimal Turns**: \n  - Reaching \\(y = 2\\) at turn 24 requires 4 actions (turns 20–23) with net \\(\\Delta y = +2\\).\n  - From \\(y = 2\\) at turn 24, reaching \\(y = 9\\) requires 7 consecutive \\(U\\) actions (turns 24–30), arriving at \\(y = 9\\) at turn 31.\n  - Total actions: 11, with \\(H = 11\\) (turns 20 to 30).\n- **Why \\(H = 11\\) is Minimal**:\n  - With \\(H = 10\\) actions, the player would be at turn 30. However, \\(y_{30} \\leq y_{24} + 6\\) and \\(y_{24} \\leq 2\\), so \\(y_{30} \\leq 8 < 9\\). Thus, \\(y = 9\\) cannot be reached by turn 30 with only 10 actions.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe sequence minimizes \\(H\\) by:\n- Moving up quickly to \\(y = 2\\) by turn 22.\n- Staying at \\(y = 2\\) for turns 22 and 23 to avoid being on \\(y = 3, 4,\\) or \\(5\\) at turn 24.\n- Moving up continuously from turn 24 onwards.\n\nActions:\n- Turn 20: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 21; safe as freeway 1 unoccupied at \\(t = 21\\)).\n- Turn 21: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 22; safe as freeway 2 unoccupied at \\(t = 22\\)).\n- Turn 22: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 2\\) for turn 23; safe).\n- Turn 23: \\(S\\) (stay at \\(y = 2\\) for turn 24; safe as freeway 2 unoccupied at \\(t = 24\\)).\n- Turn 24: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 25; safe as freeway 3 unoccupied at \\(t = 25 > 24\\)).\n- Turn 25: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 26; safe).\n- Turn 26: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 27; safe).\n- Turn 27: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 28; safe as freeway 6 always safe).\n- Turn 28: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 29; safe as freeway 7 always safe).\n- Turn 29: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 30; safe as freeway 8 always safe).\n- Turn 30: \\(U\\) (move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 31; goal reached).\n\n### Output:\n\\boxed{\nTurn 20: U \\\\\nTurn 21: U \\\\\nTurn 22: S \\\\\nTurn 23: S \\\\\nTurn 24: U \\\\\nTurn 25: U \\\\\nTurn 26: U \\\\\nTurn 27: U \\\\\nTurn 28: U \\\\\nTurn 29: U \\\\\nTurn 30: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 22 and the player is at (0,2). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nPlayer movement: \n  U: y increases by 1 (up)\n  D: y decreases by 1 (down)\n  S: stay (y remains the same)\n\nNote: The grid for y is from 0 to 9 (inclusive). We start at y=2 and want to get to y=9.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T if at that turn the player is on a freeway y (which is from 1 to 8) and the car on that freeway has a span that includes 0 at that exact turn.\n\nAlso note: When moving from y to y+1 (or y-1) at turn T, the player is considered to be on y at turn T and only moves to y+1 at the next turn (T+1). Therefore, at the turn when we move, we are still on the current freeway (if any) and then we leave that freeway in the next turn.\n\nWe are given the car states at turn t1 (which is 22). The cars move at constant speed. For a car that is left-moving (d='left'), the span at time T (>= t1) is:\n   [h - s*(T - t1), tau - s*(T - t1)]\nBut note: the representation for left-moving car is given as (head, tail) and then the span is [h, tau] at t1? However, the problem says for left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] and then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: at t1 the span is [tau, h] (so tau is the left end and h is the right end) and then at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut note the example: \n  For a right-moving car: at t1: [tau, h] and then at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nHowever, in the input, the cars are given as (head, tail, direction, speed). We must interpret the head and tail appropriately.\n\nLet me clarify the representation for cars:\n\nFor a left-moving car:\n  At time t1: the car's head is at h and tail at tau. Since it's moving left, the head is the rightmost part? Actually, the problem says for left-moving: the span at t1 is [h, tau]. But if the car is moving left, then the head (leading part) would be at the left? Or is the head the front of the car? \n\nThe problem states:\n  Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n\nThis implies that at time t1, the car occupies the interval [h, tau] (which is from h to tau, and note that h and tau are positions on the x-axis). Since the car is moving left, the entire car shifts left.\n\nBut note: if h and tau are given, and the car is moving left, then we expect that h should be greater than tau? Because if the car is moving left, the head (front) would be on the left? However, the problem does not specify the order. It says for left-moving: span(t1)=[h, tau] and then it moves to [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt]. \n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: [tau, h] at t1 and then [tau+s*dt, h+s*dt]. This implies that for a right-moving car, at t1 the car spans from tau to h, so tau <= h.\n\nBut in the input, we have for example:\n  Freeway 3: (-24, -35, right, 12) -> but note: if we take tau=-24 and h=-35, then -24 is less than -35? That doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, the problem says for right-moving: the span at t1 is [tau, h]. So if we are given (head, tail, direction, speed), then we must interpret:\n\n  For right-moving: head is the rightmost? and tail the leftmost? Then the span is [tail, head] at t1? But the input says (head, tail) and then for right-moving we have to form [tail, head]? \n\nBut look at the example: \n  Freeway 3: (-24, -35, right, 12) -> but if we form [tail, head] = [-35, -24] (if we assume the first number is head and second is tail) then that would be [-35, -24] which is increasing. But the input says (head, tail) = (-24, -35). So head=-24, tail=-35. Then for right-moving, we are told to use [tau, h] = [tail, head] = [-35, -24]. That makes sense: the car spans from -35 (left end) to -24 (right end).\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car: (48,83,left,36): head=48, tail=83. Then the span at t1 is [h, tau] = [48,83]. But 48 to 83? That would be a car that is 35 units long? And moving left? Then at a future time T, the span becomes [48-36*(T-22), 83-36*(T-22)]. \n\nBut note: the problem says that collision occurs at turn T only if the player is at (0, y) and at that turn the car on freeway y has a span that includes 0. So we need to check for each freeway we are on at turn T, whether 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at that exact turn.\n\nGiven the complexity, we need to compute the positions of the cars at each turn we consider.\n\nOur plan:\n  We are at turn 22, at y=2. We want to go to y=9. The minimal number of turns in terms of vertical movement is 7 (if we go up 7 times). But we might have to wait (S) to avoid cars. Also note we can go down? But going down from 2 would take us to 1 or 0, which might be necessary to avoid a car? However, our goal is above, so going down would be counterproductive unless we are forced to avoid a car. But note: we can only be on freeways 1 to 8. The positions y=0 and y=9 are safe (no cars). So we can use y=0 as a safe haven.\n\nWe are going to simulate the next few turns. We want the minimal H.\n\nWe consider the moves: we can only do U, D, or S. We are going to try to find the minimal H such that we can get from y=2 to y=9 without colliding.\n\nWe note that we are starting at y=2 at turn 22. We are not on a freeway? Actually, freeways are y=1 to y=8. So y=2 is a freeway? Yes. So we must check the cars on freeway 2 at turn 22.\n\nLet's compute the car positions on freeway 2 at turn 22:\n  Freeway 2: (48,83,left,36) -> one car: [48,83] at turn 22. \n  We are at x=0. Is 0 in [48,83]? 0 is not between 48 and 83 -> no collision at turn 22.\n\nBut we must consider future turns.\n\nWe are going to plan a sequence of actions. We want minimal H, so we try to go up as much as possible. However, we must avoid collisions on freeways 3,4,5,6,7,8 as we pass through them.\n\nWe'll compute the positions of the cars on each freeway at each turn we might be on that freeway.\n\nWe note the player's y at turn T (relative to t1=22) is:\n  T = 22: y=2\n  T = 23: y = 2 + a_{22} (if a22=U -> 3, D->1, S->2)\n  and so on.\n\nWe are going to simulate turns starting from 22 until we reach y=9.\n\nBut we want minimal H. So we try to see if we can go up 7 times without stopping? Then H=7.\n\nBut we must check at each turn T (from 22 to 22+6=28) the freeway we are on (if any) and whether a car is at 0.\n\nLet me compute the car positions for each freeway at the relevant turns.\n\nFirst, note that the cars move continuously. We are only concerned with when the player is on a freeway (y from 1 to 8). And at the exact turn T, we require that for the freeway y_T, no car on that freeway has 0 in its span at T.\n\nWe are going to list the freeways we will be on if we go up continuously:\n\n  Turn 22: y=2 -> freeway 2\n  Turn 23: y=3 -> freeway 3\n  Turn 24: y=4 -> freeway 4\n  Turn 25: y=5 -> freeway 5\n  Turn 26: y=6 -> freeway 6\n  Turn 27: y=7 -> freeway 7\n  Turn 28: y=8 -> freeway 8\n  Turn 29: y=9 -> safe (no car)\n\nSo we need to check turns 22 to 28.\n\nBut note: at turn 29 we are at y=9 and we are done. So if we do 7 consecutive U, we would be at y=9 at turn 29 (i.e., after 7 moves: from turn 22 to turn 28 we do U, and at turn 29 we are at 9). Therefore, H=7? But we must check collisions at turns 22,23,24,25,26,27,28.\n\nLet's check each freeway at the corresponding turn:\n\nFreeway 2 at turn 22: \n  Car: (48,83,left,36) -> span = [48, 83] (at turn 22). \n  0 is not in [48,83] -> safe.\n\nFreeway 3 at turn 23: \n  Freeway 3 has three cars: \n      car1: (-24, -35, right, 12) -> for right-moving, at turn t1=22: [tail, head] = [-35, -24]\n      car2: (60,49,right,12) -> [49,60]? But wait: the input says (head, tail) = (60,49). For right-moving, we use [tail, head] = [49,60]\n      car3: (24,13,right,12) -> [13,24]\n\n  Now at turn T=23 (so dt=1): \n      car1: [-35 + 12*1, -24 + 12*1] = [-23, -12] -> 0 not in this interval.\n      car2: [49+12, 60+12] = [61,72] -> 0 not in.\n      car3: [13+12, 24+12] = [25,36] -> 0 not in.\n  So safe.\n\nFreeway 4 at turn 24: \n  Same cars as freeway 3? Actually, the table says freeway 4 has the same set of cars: \n      car1: (-24,-35,right,12) -> at turn 24 (dt=2): [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11, 0] -> 0 is included? \n          Actually: [-35 + 12*(24-22) = -35+12*2 = -35+24 = -11, and -24+24=0]. So the span is [-11,0]. \n          Since the interval is [a, b] and it includes both endpoints, 0 is included -> collision.\n\nOh! So at turn 24, if we are on freeway 4, we collide with the first car.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be on freeway 4 at turn 24. So we must avoid that.\n\nThis means we cannot do three consecutive U moves? Because then at turn 24 we would be at y=4.\n\nWe need to adjust: we might have to wait at some point or even go down? But note: we are at turn 22: y=2.\n\nWe have to avoid being at y=4 at turn 24.\n\nWhat are our options?\n  Option 1: at turn 22, instead of going up, we stay or go down? \n      If we stay at turn 22 (S): then at turn 22 we are still at y=2. Then at turn 23 we could go up to y=3, then turn 24 to y=4? But then at turn 24 we are at y=4 -> collision.\n  Option 2: at turn 22, we go down to y=1. Then at turn 23 we can go up to y=2, then at turn 24 we go up to y=3, then turn 25 to y=4? But then at turn 25 we are at y=4 -> and at turn 25 the car on freeway4 will have moved: \n        For freeway4, at turn 25 (dt=3): \n          car1: [-35+12*3, -24+12*3] = [-35+36, -24+36] = [1, 12] -> 0 not in.\n          car2: [49+36, 60+36] = [85,96] -> safe.\n          car3: [13+36,24+36] = [49,60] -> safe.\n        So at turn25, y=4 would be safe? But we are at y=4 at turn25? However, we are not at y=4 at turn24? \n\nBut note: we started at turn22 at y=2. Then:\n  turn22: D -> y=1 (at the end of turn22? Actually the update: at turn22 we take action a_{22} and then at the next turn (23) we are at the new y. So:\n      T=22: action taken -> but we are at y=2 at the start of T=22. After the action, at the next state (T=23) we are at the new y.\n\nSo:\n  T=22: we are at y=2. We take an action. Then at T=23, we are at:\n        if U: y=3\n        if D: y=1\n        if S: y=2\n\nTherefore, if we do D at turn22, then at T=23 we are at y=1.\n\nThen at T=23: we can take an action. If we do U at T=23, then at T=24 we are at y=2.\n\nThen at T=24: we do U -> at T=25 we are at y=3.\n\nThen at T=25: we do U -> at T=26 we are at y=4.\n\nThen we must check freeway4 at T=26? Because we are at y=4 at T=26.\n\nAt T=26 (which is 26-22=4 turns later) for freeway4:\n  car1: [-35+12*4, -24+12*4] = [-35+48, -24+48] = [13,24] -> safe (0 not in)\n  car2: [49+12*4,60+12*4] = [49+48,60+48] = [97,108] -> safe\n  car3: [13+48,24+48] = [61,72] -> safe.\n\nThen we can continue: \n  T=26: y=4 -> then T=27: y=5, T=28: y=6, T=29: y=7, T=30: y=8, T=31: y=9.\n\nBut that takes 9 moves (from T22 to T30: 9 actions? because from T22 to T23 is one action, then T23 to T24 is another, ... until T30 to T31? Actually, we start at T22 and do actions at T22, T23, ... until T30? Then we would be at y=9 at T31? \n\nBut note: we do an action at each turn. The number of actions H is the number of turns we take actions. We start at T22 and do actions at T22, T23, ... until we reach y=9 at the next state.\n\nWe want to be at y=9 at the state after the last action. So if we do an action at T22, then we are at a new y at T23. We need that at some turn T, after the last action we are at y=9.\n\nIn the above plan (with D then U then U then U ...):\n\n  T22: D -> at T23: y=1\n  T23: U -> at T24: y=2\n  T24: U -> at T25: y=3\n  T25: U -> at T26: y=4\n  T26: U -> at T27: y=5\n  T27: U -> at T28: y=6\n  T28: U -> at T29: y=7\n  T29: U -> at T30: y=8\n  T30: U -> at T31: y=9\n\nThat's 9 actions. But we know we can do better? Because without the detour we could have done 7. But we had to avoid the collision at T24.\n\nAlternatively, we might wait at y=3 for one turn? Because at T23 we are at y=3 (if we did U at T22). Then at T23 we do S (stay) -> then at T24 we are still at y=3. Then at T24 we do U -> at T25 we are at y=4.\n\nNow, at T24 we are at y=3? We must check freeway3 at T24.\n\nFreeway3 at T24 (dt=2):\n  car1: [-35+12*2, -24+12*2] = [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? -> collision at T24 if we are at y=3? \n  But wait: at T24 we are at y=3? Actually, freeway3 is the freeway for y=3. And the car is on freeway3. So if we are at y=3 at T24, then we are on freeway3 and we collide? Because 0 is in [-11,0]? \n\nBut note: the interval is [-11,0]. Since 0 is the endpoint, it is included. So we would collide.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at y=3 at T24 either? \n\nWhat if we do two waits? \n\nWe try:\n\n  T22: U -> T23: y=3\n  T23: S -> T24: y=3 -> but then at T24 we collide? Because freeway3 at T24: car1 has span [-11,0] -> includes 0 -> collision.\n\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nWhat if we do U at T22 to y=3, then at T23 we go down to y=2? Then at T24 we are at y=2? Then we can go up again? \n\nBut then we are back to y=2 at T24. Then we can go up at T24 to y=3 at T25, then at T26 to y=4? \n\nBut we must check:\n\n  T22: U -> T23: y=3 -> check freeway3 at T23: \n        dt=1: \n          car1: [-35+12, -24+12] = [-23,-12] -> safe\n          car2: [49+12,60+12] = [61,72] -> safe\n          car3: [13+12,24+12] = [25,36] -> safe\n        so safe.\n\n  T23: D -> T24: y=2 -> freeway2 at T24: \n        The car on freeway2: (48,83,left,36) -> at T24 (dt=2): [48-36*2, 83-36*2] = [48-72,83-72] = [-24,11] -> 0 is in [-24,11]? Yes! -> collision.\n\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, at T23 we go down to y=2? But then we collide at T24 on freeway2? \n\nBut note: we are at y=2 at T24? Then we must check freeway2 at T24: which is [-24,11] -> includes 0 -> collision.\n\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nWhat if we go down at T22 to y=1? Then:\n\n  T22: D -> T23: y=1 -> freeway1 at T23: \n        car: (48,83,left,36) -> at T23 (dt=1): [48-36,83-36] = [12,47] -> safe (0 not in)\n\n  Then at T23: we can do U -> T24: y=2 -> freeway2 at T24: \n        car: [48-36*2,83-36*2] = [-24,11] -> 0 in? -> collision.\n\nSo that doesn't work either.\n\nAlternatively, at T23 we do S at y=1? Then T24: y=1 -> freeway1 at T24: \n        car: [48-36*2,83-36*2] = [-24,11] -> 0 in -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot be at freeway1 at T24? \n\nBut what if we go down to y=1 at T22, then at T23 we go down to y=0? \n  T22: D -> T23: y=1 (and then we do D at T23) -> T24: y=0 -> safe (no car at y=0).\n\nThen at T24: we can do U -> T25: y=1 -> freeway1 at T25: \n        car: [48-36*(25-22)=48-108, 83-108] = [-60,-25] -> safe (0 not in)\n\nThen T25: U -> T26: y=2 -> freeway2 at T26: \n        car: [48-36*(26-22)=48-144,83-144] = [-96,-61] -> safe.\n\nThen we can go up:\n\n  T26: U -> T27: y=3 -> freeway3 at T27: dt=5 (because 27-22=5)\n        car1: [-35+12*5, -24+12*5] = [-35+60, -24+60] = [25,36] -> safe\n        car2: [49+60,60+60] = [109,120] -> safe\n        car3: [13+60,24+60] = [73,84] -> safe\n\n  T27: U -> T28: y=4 -> freeway4 at T28: dt=6\n        car1: [-35+12*6, -24+12*6] = [-35+72, -24+72] = [37,48] -> safe\n        car2: [49+72,60+72] = [121,132] -> safe\n        car3: [13+72,24+72] = [85,96] -> safe\n\n  T28: U -> T29: y=5 -> freeway5 at T29: dt=7\n        freeway5 has the same cars as freeway3 and 4: \n        car1: [-35+12*7, -24+12*7] = [-35+84, -24+84] = [49,60] -> safe\n        car2: [49+84,60+84] = [133,144] -> safe\n        car3: [13+84,24+84] = [97,108] -> safe\n\n  T29: U -> T30: y=6 -> freeway6 at T30: dt=8\n        freeway6: (-42,-53,right,6) -> right-moving, so at t1: [tail, head] = [-53,-42]\n        at T30: [-53+6*8, -42+6*8] = [-53+48, -42+48] = [-5,6] -> 0 is in? -> collision.\n\nOh no! So at T30, we are at y=6 and the car on freeway6 has [-5,6] which includes 0 -> collision.\n\nSo we must avoid that.\n\nWe can try to wait at some point. For example, after getting to y=5 at T29, we don't go up immediately? \n\nBut we are at T29: y=5. Then we can do S at T29: then at T30 we are still at y=5? Then check freeway5 at T30: dt=8\n        car1: [-35+12*8, -24+12*8] = [-35+96, -24+96] = [61,72] -> safe\n        car2: [49+96,60+96] = [145,156] -> safe\n        car3: [13+96,24+96] = [109,120] -> safe\n\nThen at T30: we do U -> T31: y=6 -> freeway6 at T31: dt=9\n        car: [-53+6*9, -42+6*9] = [-53+54, -42+54] = [1,12] -> safe (0 not in)\n\nThen T31: U -> T32: y=7 -> freeway7 at T32: dt=10\n        freeway7: (-42,-53,right,6) -> same as freeway6? \n        car: [-53+60, -42+60] = [7,18] -> safe\n\nThen T32: U -> T33: y=8 -> freeway8 at T33: dt=11\n        freeway8: two cars: \n            car1: (-42,-53,right,6) -> [ -53+6*11, -42+6*11] = [-53+66, -42+66] = [13,24] -> safe\n            car2: (24,13,right,6) -> for right-moving: [tail, head] = [13,24] at t1. \n                   at T33: [13+6*11, 24+6*11] = [13+66,24+66] = [79,90] -> safe\n\nThen T33: U -> T34: y=9 -> safe.\n\nThis plan: \n   T22: D -> T23: y=1\n   T23: D -> T24: y=0\n   T24: U -> T25: y=1\n   T25: U -> T26: y=2\n   T26: U -> T27: y=3\n   T27: U -> T28: y=4\n   T28: U -> T29: y=5\n   T29: S -> T30: y=5  (wait)\n   T30: U -> T31: y=6\n   T31: U -> T32: y=7\n   T32: U -> T33: y=8\n   T33: U -> T34: y=9\n\nTotal moves: 12.\n\nBut we might find a shorter path.\n\nAlternatively, we might not go all the way down to 0.\n\nWe must avoid the collision at freeway4 at T24 and freeway6 at T30.\n\nLet me reexamine the direct path with waiting at some safe spot.\n\nWe know that at T24, if we are at y=4 we collide. So we must not be at y=4 at T24.\n\nWe also must not be at y=3 at T24? (because freeway3 at T24 has car1 at [-11,0] -> collision) and not at y=2 at T24? (freeway2: [-24,11] -> collision) and not at y=1 at T24? (freeway1: [-24,11] -> collision). \n\nWhat about y=5? But we cannot get to y=5 by T24? Because we start at y=2 at T22. The maximum we can do is two U: T22: U -> T23: y=3; T23: U -> T24: y=4. So we cannot be at y=5 at T24.\n\nTherefore, the only safe freeway at T24 is none? But we must be at y=0 or y=9? \n\nSo at T24, we must be at y=0? \n\nBut how? We start at y=2 at T22. We can do two D: \n  T22: D -> T23: y=1\n  T23: D -> T24: y=0 -> safe.\n\nThen we can proceed from y=0.\n\nBut then we have to go up. We already saw that if we go up from 0, we might have a collision at freeway6 at T30. But we avoided that by waiting at y=5 at T29 (by doing a S at T29). \n\nBut can we avoid the wait at T29? \n\nWe were at T24: y=0. Then:\n\n  T24: U -> T25: y=1 -> freeway1 at T25: \n        car: [48-36*3, 83-36*3] = [48-108,83-108] = [-60,-25] -> safe.\n\n  T25: U -> T26: y=2 -> freeway2 at T26: \n        car: [48-36*4,83-36*4] = [48-144,83-144] = [-96,-61] -> safe.\n\n  T26: U -> T27: y=3 -> freeway3 at T27: dt=5 (as before) -> safe.\n\n  T27: U -> T28: y=4 -> freeway4 at T28: dt=6 -> safe (as before)\n\n  T28: U -> T29: y=5 -> freeway5 at T29: dt=7 -> safe.\n\n  T29: U -> T30: y=6 -> freeway6 at T30: dt=8 -> car: [-53+6*8, -42+6*8] = [-53+48, -42+48] = [-5,6] -> collision.\n\nSo we must avoid being at y=6 at T30.\n\nHow? We can delay our arrival at y=6. We are at y=5 at T29. We can do S at T29 to stay at y=5 for T30? Then at T30 we are at y=5 -> safe (freeway5 at dt=8: safe as above). Then at T30 we do U -> T31: y=6 -> freeway6 at T31: dt=9 -> [1,12] -> safe.\n\nThen we continue.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n  T22: D\n  T23: D\n  T24: U\n  T25: U\n  T26: U\n  T27: U\n  T28: U\n  T29: U  -> but wait, if we do U at T28 we go to y=5 at T29, then at T29 we do S (so we are at y=5 at T30) and then at T30 we do U to go to y=6 at T31.\n\nBut how many moves? \n\n  T22: D -> T23: y=1\n  T23: D -> T24: y=0\n  T24: U -> T25: y=1\n  T25: U -> T26: y=2\n  T26: U -> T27: y=3\n  T27: U -> T28: y=4\n  T28: U -> T29: y=5\n  T29: S -> T30: y=5\n  T30: U -> T31: y=6\n  T31: U -> T32: y=7\n  T32: U -> T33: y=8\n  T33: U -> T34: y=9\n\nThat's 12 moves. But we can try to combine or find a shorter path.\n\nAlternatively, we might not go down to 0 at the beginning? \n\nWhat if we only go down to y=0 at T24, but we try to go up faster? \n\nBut we have to avoid the freeway4 at T24 by being at y=0. And then we can go up without waiting until T28? \n\nBut then we hit the freeway6 problem at T30.\n\nIs there a way to avoid the freeway6 collision without waiting? \n\nWe could try to be at y=6 at a different turn. For example, if we arrive at y=6 at T31 instead of T30, then freeway6 at T31: [1,12] -> safe.\n\nBut how to adjust the timing? We are starting at T24 at y=0. The minimal moves to get to y=9 is 9 moves: \n  T24: U (y=1 at T25)\n  T25: U (y=2 at T26)\n  T26: U (y=3 at T27)\n  T27: U (y=4 at T28)\n  T28: U (y=5 at T29)\n  T29: U (y=6 at T30) -> collision\n  So we must insert a wait somewhere.\n\nWe can wait at any freeway that is safe. For example, we can wait at y=0? But we are already at y=0 at T24. We can do:\n\n  T24: S -> then we are at y=0 at T25 -> safe.\n  T25: U -> T26: y=1 -> freeway1 at T26: \n        car: [48-36*(26-22)=48-144,83-144] = [-96,-61] -> safe.\n  T26: U -> T27: y=2 -> freeway2: same car: [-96,-61] -> safe.\n  T27: U -> T28: y=3 -> freeway3 at T28: dt=6 (28-22=6)\n        car1: [-35+12*6, -24+12*6] = [-35+72, -24+72] = [37,48] -> safe\n        car2: [49+72,60+72] = [121,132] -> safe\n        car3: [13+72,24+72] = [85,96] -> safe\n  T28: U -> T29: y=4 -> freeway4 at T29: dt=7 -> \n        car1: [-35+84, -24+84] = [49,60] -> safe\n        car2: [49+84,60+84] = [133,144] -> safe\n        car3: [13+84,24+84] = [97,108] -> safe\n  T29: U -> T30: y=5 -> freeway5 at T30: dt=8 -> \n        car1: [-35+96, -24+96] = [61,72] -> safe\n        car2: [49+96,60+96] = [145,156] -> safe\n        car3: [13+96,24+96] = [109,120] -> safe\n  T30: U -> T31: y=6 -> freeway6 at T31: dt=9 -> [1,12] -> safe\n  T31: U -> T32: y=7 -> freeway7 at T32: dt=10 -> [7,18] -> safe\n  T32: U -> T33: y=8 -> freeway8 at T33: dt=11 -> \n        car1: [-53+66, -42+66] = [13,24] -> safe\n        car2: [13+66,24+66] = [79,90] -> safe\n  T33: U -> T34: y=9\n\nBut we did an extra wait at T24 (S) so that's one extra move? Total moves: 10 moves? \n\nBut wait: \n  T24: S -> then T25: U, T26: U, T27: U, T28: U, T29: U, T30: U, T31: U, T32: U, T33: U -> 10 actions? \n\nBut we started at T24 at y=0. We did 10 actions: from T24 to T33 (inclusive) -> 10 turns? Then we reach y=9 at T34.\n\nBut note: we also did two moves at T22 and T23: D and D. So total moves = 2 (for T22, T23) + 10 (for T24 to T33) = 12 moves.\n\nBut in the above we did at T24: S, so we are not moving up immediately. \n\nAlternatively, we can avoid the initial two downs by waiting at y=2 for one turn? \n\nBut we saw that at T22: if we do S, then at T23 we are at y=2. Then at T23 we must do something? But at T23, if we do U, then we go to y=3 at T24 -> and freeway3 at T24: car1 has [-11,0] -> collision.\n\nIf we do D at T23, then we go to y=1 at T24 -> freeway1 at T24: [-24,11] -> collision.\n\nIf we do S at T23, then we are at y=2 at T24 -> freeway2 at T24: [-24,11] -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot be at any freeway at T24? Therefore, we must be at y=0 at T24. The only way is to do two D: T22: D, T23: D.\n\nSo the initial two D are necessary.\n\nThen we have to go up. And we have to avoid the freeway6 collision at T30. We can insert a wait somewhere between T24 and T30. We inserted one wait at T24 (by doing S) and then we were able to avoid the freeway6 collision because we arrived at y=6 at T31 instead of T30. \n\nBut we could also wait at a later safe freeway. For example, we can go up continuously from T24 to T28: then we are at y=5 at T29. Then we wait at T29 (S) and then go up at T30. \n\nThat gives:\n\n  T22: D -> T23: y=1\n  T23: D -> T24: y=0\n  T24: U -> T25: y=1\n  T25: U -> T26: y=2\n  T26: U -> T27: y=3\n  T27: U -> T28: y=4\n  T28: U -> T29: y=5\n  T29: S -> T30: y=5   (waiting here)\n  T30: U -> T31: y=6\n  T31: U -> T32: y=7\n  T32: U -> T33: y=8\n  T33: U -> T34: y=9\n\nThat's 12 moves: T22 to T33: 12 actions.\n\nAlternatively, if we do not wait at T24 but wait later, we save one move? But we are not waiting at T24, we are waiting at T29.\n\nTotal moves: 12.\n\nBut can we save a move by waiting earlier? For example, wait at a freeway that is safe and that doesn't cost extra moves? \n\nNote: we must avoid being at y=6 at T30. The minimal time to get to y=6 from y=0 is 6 moves: \n  T24: y=0\n  T25: y=1\n  T26: y=2\n  T27: y=3\n  T28: y=4\n  T29: y=5\n  T30: y=6 -> collision\n\nSo we must not do the last U at T29. Instead, we can wait at any of the freeways from y=0 to y=5. But if we wait earlier, we arrive at y=6 even later? \n\nActually, if we wait at T24 (by doing S) then we are at y=0 at T25, then we start going up. Then we get to y=6 at T31 -> safe. \n\nBut that also takes 12 moves: \n  T22: D, T23: D, T24: S, T25: U, T26: U, T27: U, T28: U, T29: U, T30: U, T31: U, T32: U, T33: U -> 12 moves? \n  Then at T34: y=9.\n\nActually, count the actions: \n  T22: D\n  T23: D\n  T24: S   -> now we are at T24, after S we are at y=0 at T25.\n  T25: U -> T26: y=1\n  T26: U -> T27: y=2\n  T27: U -> T28: y=3\n  T28: U -> T29: y=4\n  T29: U -> T30: y=5\n  T30: U -> T31: y=6\n  T31: U -> T32: y=7\n  T32: U -> T33: y=8\n  T33: U -> T34: y=9\n\nBut that's 12 actions: T22 to T33. And we reach y=9 at T34.\n\nThe same as the previous plan.\n\nBut note: in the first plan without the wait at T24 but with wait at T29, we also have 12 actions.\n\nSo both are 12. \n\nBut is there a plan with 11 moves? \n\nWe must be at y=0 at T24 (because we cannot be at any freeway at T24). Then we need at least 9 moves to go from y=0 to y=9 (since we do 9 U moves). But then we have to account for the initial two D moves? That would be 2 + 9 = 11 moves? \n\nBut wait: if we do 2 downs and then 9 ups, that's 11 actions. But will we avoid the collision at freeway6? \n\nWith 11 actions:\n\n  T22: D -> T23: y=1\n  T23: D -> T24: y=0\n  T24: U -> T25: y=1\n  T25: U -> T26: y=2\n  T26: U -> T27: y=3\n  T27: U -> T28: y=4\n  T28: U -> T29: y=5\n  T29: U -> T30: y=6  -> collision (freeway6 at T30: dt=8 -> [-5,6] includes 0)\n\nSo we collide at T30.\n\nTherefore, we must have at least one wait somewhere. So minimal moves is 12.\n\nBut can we do the wait not at T24 or T29 but somewhere else? \n\nFor example, after T24 we go up to y=2 at T26, then wait at y=2 at T27? \n\n  T22: D\n  T23: D\n  T24: U -> T25: y=1\n  T25: U -> T26: y=2\n  T26: S -> T27: y=2 (wait)\n  T27: U -> T28: y=3\n  T28: U -> T29: y=4\n  T29: U -> T30: y=5\n  T30: U -> T31: y=6 -> freeway6 at T31: [1,12] -> safe\n  T31: U -> T32: y=7\n  T32: U -> T33: y=8\n  T33: U -> T34: y=9\n\nThis is 12 moves: \n  T22: D\n  T23: D\n  T24: U\n  T25: U\n  T26: S   (wait at y=2)\n  T27: U\n  T28: U\n  T29: U\n  T30: U\n  T31: U\n  T32: U\n  T33: U\n\nThen at T34: y=9.\n\nThis also works. And we avoid the freeway6 collision because we arrive at y=6 at T31.\n\nNow, we must check the freeway at every step:\n\n  T22: D -> T23: y=1 -> freeway1 at T23: [48-36,83-36]=[12,47] -> safe.\n  T23: D -> T24: y=0 -> safe.\n  T24: U -> T25: y=1 -> freeway1 at T25: [48-36*3,83-36*3]=[-60,-25] -> safe.\n  T25: U -> T26: y=2 -> freeway2 at T26: [48-36*4,83-36*4]=[-96,-61] -> safe.\n  T26: S -> T27: y=2 -> freeway2 at T27: [48-36*5,83-36*5]=[48-180,83-180]=[-132,-97] -> safe.\n  T27: U -> T28: y=3 -> freeway3 at T28: dt=6 (28-22=6) -> \n        car1: [-35+12*6, -24+12*6] = [37,48] -> safe\n        car2: [49+72,60+72]=[121,132] -> safe\n        car3: [13+72,24+72]=[85,96] -> safe\n  T28: U -> T29: y=4 -> freeway4 at T29: dt=7 -> [49,60], [133,144], [97,108] -> safe.\n  T29: U -> T30: y=5 -> freeway5 at T30: dt=8 -> [61,72], [145,156], [109,120] -> safe.\n  T30: U -> T31: y=6 -> freeway6 at T31: dt=9 -> [1,12] -> safe (0 not in [1,12]? but 0 is not in [1,12] -> safe)\n        Note: [1,12] does not include 0? Correct.\n  T31: U -> T32: y=7 -> freeway7 at T32: dt=10 -> car: [-53+60, -42+60]=[7,18] -> safe.\n  T32: U -> T33: y=8 -> freeway8 at T33: dt=11 -> \n        car1: [-53+66, -42+66]=[13,24] -> safe\n        car2: [13+66,24+66]=[79,90] -> safe\n  T33: U -> T34: y=9 -> safe.\n\nSo this works.\n\nTherefore, a minimal sequence of 12 actions is:\n\n  Turn 22: D\n  Turn 23: D\n  Turn 24: U\n  Turn 25: U\n  Turn 26: S\n  Turn 27: U\n  Turn 28: U\n  Turn 29: U\n  Turn 30: U\n  Turn 31: U\n  Turn 32: U\n  Turn 33: U\n\nBut wait, we have 12 actions? And we start at turn22 and end at turn33? Then after turn33 we are at y=9.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? We have 12 actions. We saw that 11 actions would collide at freeway6. So 12 is minimal.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=12.\n\nWe output the actions from turn22 to turn33.\n\nBut let me double-check the freeway6 at T31: \n  freeway6: only one car: (-42,-53,right,6) -> \n      at t1=22: [tail, head] = [-53, -42]\n      at T31: dt=9 -> [-53+6*9, -42+6*9] = [-53+54, -42+54] = [1,12] -> does not include 0 -> safe.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 22: D\nTurn 23: D\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: S\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\n}\n\nNote: We have 12 actions. The last action (Turn33: U) gets us to y=9 at the next state (turn34). But the problem only requires the sequence until we reach (0,9). This sequence does that.\n\nWe have to ensure that we did not miss any collision. We checked each step.\n\nTherefore, this is a solution.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 22\\) is 12.

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get the player from (0,1) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 23, and I'm given the car states for each freeway.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movements. Cars move left or right with constant speed, and I need to make sure that when I'm on a freeway at a certain turn, no car on that freeway has its span including x=0 at that turn.\n\nThe player moves vertically: up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, with y clamped between 0 and 9.\n\nI start at y=1 at turn t=23. I need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of turns would be if I could go directly up, but I have to avoid cars on the way. So I need to check for each freeway when it's safe to be there.\n\nLet me denote the turns starting from t_1 = 23. So turn 0 relative to t_1 is t=23, turn 1 is t=24, and so on.\n\nI need to find the sequence of actions from turn t=23 to some turn when y=9.\n\nSince I start at y=1 and need to get to y=9, the minimum possible H is 8, if I go up every turn: U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U to go from 1 to 9 in 8 steps? From y=1, after one U, y=2, after two, y=3, ..., after eight U, y=9. Yes, 8 turns to go from 1 to 9.\n\nBut I might have to wait or go down to avoid cars, so H could be more than 8.\n\nBut let's see if I can do it in 8 turns.\n\nI need to be on freeway y at turn T only if no car on that freeway has 0 in its span at turn T.\n\nThe collision is checked only when I'm on the freeway at that turn. If I move to a different y, I'm not on the previous freeway anymore.\n\nAlso, when I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, and I take action a_T which determines y_{T+1}. But the position at turn T is (0, y_T), and I might be collided if for freeway y_T, at turn T, there is a car with 0 in span.\n\nThen at turn T+1, I am on y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to compute for each turn T whether x=0 is occupied by any car on that freeway.\n\nThe cars are given at turn t_1=23, and I need for turns T >= 23.\n\nThe span changes linearly with time.\n\nLet me define the time relative to t_1. Let τ = T - t_1, so τ=0 is turn 23, τ=1 is turn 24, etc.\n\nFor a car, at τ=0, it has span [h, τ] or [τ, h] depending on direction.\n\nDirection: left-moving means it moves left, so position decreases. Right-moving means position increases.\n\nIn the update:\n\nLeft-moving: span at T is [h - s (T - t_1), τ - s (T - t_1)] but τ is tail, I think it's a typo.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nIt says: for car k on freeway i, at turn t_1, head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nThen at turn T > t_1:\n\nLeft-moving: span becomes [h - s (T - t_1), τ - s (T - t_1)]\n\nBut head and tail: for left-moving, if it's moving left, head should be the left end or right end?\n\nI think there might be inconsistency in notation.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn the right-moving case, at t_1, span is [τ, h], which might imply τ is left end, h is right end? But it says \"head h, tail τ\", so for right-moving, head might be front.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I should think in terms of the position.\n\nx=0 is the point we care about.\n\nFor a car, the span includes all x where the car is present.\n\nAt turn T, for a left-moving car, the span is [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt] where Δt = T - t_1.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] with Δt = T - t_1.\n\nNow, collision if 0 is in the span at turn T for the freeway I'm on.\n\nAlso, note that the freeway has multiple cars, so I need to check all cars on that freeway at that time.\n\nNow, let's list all freeways and their cars at τ=0 (t=23).\n\nFreeway k from 1 to 8.\n\nGiven:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (h=12, τ=47, d=left, s=36) — but h and τ, for left-moving, at t_1, span [12,47]. But 12 to 47, that's a long car? Speed 36, which is fast.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? (12,47,left,36)\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: (-12,-23,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12), (36,25,right,12)\n\nSimilarly freeway 4 and 5 same as 3.\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7: same as 6? (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: (-36,-47,right,6), (30,19,right,6)\n\nLet's write clearly.\n\nFirst, for each freeway, I need to find when x=0 is not covered by any car on that freeway.\n\nThat is, for each freeway k, find times τ when no car on k has 0 in its span.\n\nSince τ is discrete turns, I need for each τ, whether freeway k is safe at τ.\n\nτ = T - t_1, so for τ >=0.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway the set of τ where it is unsafe (0 in some car span) or safe.\n\nStart with freeway 1: one car, left-moving, s=36, span at τ=0: [12,47]\n\nAt time τ, Δt = τ, so span: [12 - 36τ, 47 - 36τ]\n\n0 in span if 12 - 36τ <= 0 <= 47 - 36τ\n\nThat is, 12 - 36τ <= 0 and 0 <= 47 - 36τ\n\nFirst inequality: 12 - 36τ <= 0 => 12 <= 36τ => τ >= 12/36 = 1/3, so since τ integer, τ >= 1? τ >= ceil(1/3) = 1? But let's solve inequalities.\n\n12 - 36τ <= 0 => τ >= 12/36 = 1/3 ≈ 0.333, so for τ >= 1, it holds since τ integer.\n\nτ >= 1.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 47 - 36τ => 36τ <= 47 => τ <= 47/36 ≈ 1.305, so τ <= 1 since τ integer.\n\nτ <= 1 because 36*1=36 <=47, 36*2=72>47, so τ <=1.\n\nSo 0 in span when τ >=1 and τ <=1, so only at τ=1.\n\nτ >=1 and τ <=1, so τ=1.\n\nAt τ=0: span [12,47], 0 not in [12,47], so safe.\n\nAt τ=1: span [12-36, 47-36] = [-24, 11], 0 is between -24 and 11, yes, 0 in span.\n\nAt τ=2: [12-72,47-72] = [-60,-25], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSo freeway 1 unsafe only at τ=1.\n\nτ=1 corresponds to turn t=23 +1 =24.\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1, (12,47,left,36), so same thing, unsafe only at τ=1.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nDirection right, so at τ=0, span [τ, h] = [-23, -12]? In the notation, Span(t_1) = [τ, h] for right-moving.\n\nGiven: for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so here τ=-23, h=-12, so span [-23, -12] at τ=0.\n\nThen at time τ, span [τ + s τ, h + s τ] with s=12, Δt=τ.\n\ns τ, but τ is time, s is speed.\n\nΔt = τ, s=12.\n\nSpan: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [-23 + 12τ, -12 + 12τ]\n\n0 in this span if -23 + 12τ <= 0 <= -12 + 12τ\n\nFirst: -23 + 12τ <= 0 => 12τ <= 23 => τ <= 23/12 ≈ 1.916, so τ <=1\n\nSecond: 0 <= -12 + 12τ => 12 <= 12τ => τ >=1\n\nSo τ >=1 and τ <=1, so τ=1.\n\nAt τ=1: [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11, 0], 0 is included.\n\nAt τ=0: [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nAt τ=2: [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo unsafe at τ=1.\n\nNow second car on freeway 3: (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nSpan at τ=0: [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nAt time τ: [-59 + 12τ, -48 + 12τ]\n\n0 in span: -59 + 12τ <= 0 <= -48 + 12τ\n\nFirst: -59 + 12τ <=0 => 12τ <=59 => τ <= 59/12 ≈ 4.916, so τ <=4\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48 + 12τ => 12τ >=48 => τ >=4\n\nSo τ >=4 and τ <=4, τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11, 0], 0 included.\n\nAt other times, not.\n\nThird car on freeway 3: (36,25,right,12)\n\nSpan at τ=0: [τ, h] = [25, 36]? τ=25, h=36, so [25,36]\n\nAt time τ: [25 + 12τ, 36 + 12τ]\n\n0 in span: 25 +12τ <=0 <=36 +12τ? But 25+12τ >0 for τ>=0, so never <=0, so 0 not in span for any τ. Safe always.\n\nSo for freeway 3, unsafe when first car at τ=1 or second car at τ=4.\n\nThat is, unsafe at τ=1 and τ=4.\n\nNow freeway 4: same as freeway 3, cars: (-12,-23,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12), (36,25,right,12)\n\nSo same as above, unsafe at τ=1 and τ=4.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5 same, unsafe at τ=1 and τ=4.\n\nNow freeway 6: one car (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nRight-moving, span at τ=0: [τ, h] = [-47, -36]\n\nAt time τ: [-47 + 6τ, -36 + 6τ]\n\n0 in span: -47 +6τ <=0 <= -36 +6τ\n\nFirst: -47+6τ <=0 => 6τ <=47 => τ <= 47/6 ≈7.833, τ <=7\n\nSecond: 0 <= -36 +6τ => 6τ >=36 => τ >=6\n\nSo τ >=6 and τ <=7.\n\nThus unsafe for τ=6,7.\n\nAt τ=6: [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nτ=7: [-47+42, -36+42] = [-5,6], 0 in\n\nτ=8: [-47+48, -36+48] = [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo unsafe at τ=6 and τ=7.\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway 6, (-36,-47,right,6), so unsafe at τ=6,7.\n\nNow freeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-36,-47,right,6), same as above, unsafe at τ=6,7.\n\nSecond car: (30,19,right,6)\n\nRight-moving, span at τ=0: [τ, h] = [19,30]\n\nAt time τ: [19 + 6τ, 30 + 6τ]\n\n0 in span: 19+6τ <=0 <=30+6τ? But 19+6τ >=19>0 for τ>=0, so never <=0, so 0 not in span. Always safe.\n\nSo for freeway 8, only the first car matters, unsafe at τ=6,7.\n\nNow summarize for each freeway, unsafe at which τ (relative to t_1=23):\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe τ=1\n\nFreeway 2: unsafe τ=1\n\nFreeway 3: unsafe τ=1,4\n\nFreeway 4: unsafe τ=1,4\n\nFreeway 5: unsafe τ=1,4\n\nFreeway 6: unsafe τ=6,7\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe τ=6,7\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe τ=6,7\n\nAnd for other τ, they are safe.\n\nNow, I start at y=1 at τ=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some τ.\n\ny from 1 to 9, minimum 8 steps up.\n\nBut I have to avoid being on a freeway when it is unsafe for that τ.\n\nAt each turn, I choose to go U, D, or S, changing y.\n\ny must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nNow, I need a sequence of actions such that for each turn τ, when I am at y_τ, freeway y_τ is safe at that τ.\n\nAnd I start at τ=0, y=1, and end when y=9.\n\nNow, let me denote the state at each τ.\n\nτ=0: position y=1. Freeway 1 at τ=0 is safe, as we saw, since unsafe only at τ=1.\n\nSo I can be at y=1 at τ=0, safe.\n\nNow, I need to plan the moves.\n\nThe minimal H might be 8, but I need to check if I can go up every turn without being on an unsafe freeway at that turn.\n\nLet me simulate going straight up.\n\nAt τ=0: y=1, freeway 1 safe? At τ=0, freeway 1 is safe, as above.\n\nAction: I can choose to go U, D, or S.\n\nIf I go U, at τ=1, y=2.\n\nNow τ=1: y=2, freeway 2 at τ=1 is unsafe, because freeway 2 unsafe at τ=1.\n\nFreeway 2 unsafe at τ=1, yes.\n\nSo if I am at y=2 at τ=1, I collide.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be at y=2 at τ=1.\n\nIf I stay at y=1 at τ=1, but freeway 1 is unsafe at τ=1, so also collide if I stay.\n\nAt τ=1, freeway 1 is unsafe, so I cannot be at y=1 at τ=1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 unsafe at τ=1, so cannot be at y=2 at τ=1.\n\nWhat about other freeways?\n\nFreeway 3 unsafe at τ=1, so y=3 unsafe at τ=1.\n\nFreeway 4 unsafe at τ=1, y=4 unsafe.\n\nFreeway 5 unsafe at τ=1, y=5 unsafe.\n\nNow freeway 6: unsafe at τ=6,7, but at τ=1, freeway 6 is safe, since unsafe only at 6,7.\n\nSimilarly freeway 7 safe at τ=1, freeway 8 safe at τ=1 except we have cars, but freeway 8 unsafe only at τ=6,7, so at τ=1 safe.\n\nBut y=6,7,8 are possible, but at τ=1, if I could be there, but I start from y=1 at τ=0.\n\nAt τ=0, y=1.\n\nIf I go U at τ=0, to y=2 at τ=1, but y=2 unsafe at τ=1.\n\nIf I go S at τ=0, stay y=1 at τ=1, but y=1 unsafe at τ=1.\n\nIf I go D, but y=1, go down to y=0.\n\ny=0 is not a freeway, I think. Freeways are from y=1 to 8, y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars, always safe.\n\nSimilarly y=9 safe.\n\nSo at τ=0, if I go D, to y=0 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=0, safe.\n\nBut I need to go up to 9, so from y=0, I can go up later.\n\nBut let's see the options.\n\nTo avoid collision at τ=1, since y=1 to 5 are all unsafe at τ=1 (freeways 1 to 5 unsafe), and y=6,7,8 are safe at τ=1, but I can't reach them from y=1 in one step.\n\nFrom y=1 at τ=0, I can only go to y=0,1,2 at τ=1.\n\ny=0 safe, y=1 unsafe, y=2 unsafe.\n\nSo only safe choice is to go to y=0 at τ=1 by going D at τ=0.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=0.\n\nNow from there, I need to go up.\n\nBut I have to avoid other unsafe times.\n\nNow, let's list all unsafe times for each y.\n\ny corresponds to freeway k.\n\nfreeway 1: y=1, unsafe τ=1\n\nfreeway 2: y=2, unsafe τ=1\n\nfreeway 3: y=3, unsafe τ=1,4\n\nfreeway 4: y=4, unsafe τ=1,4\n\nfreeway 5: y=5, unsafe τ=1,4\n\nfreeway 6: y=6, unsafe τ=6,7\n\nfreeway 7: y=7, unsafe τ=6,7\n\nfreeway 8: y=8, unsafe τ=6,7\n\nAnd y=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=1 at τ=0 to y=9 at some τ.\n\nSince at τ=1, I must not be on y=1 to 5, and I can only be on y=0, or if I could be on y=6,7,8 but I can't from y=1 in one step.\n\nSo at τ=1, only safe y is 0.\n\nThus, action at τ=0 (turn t_1=23) must be D, to go to y=0 at τ=1.\n\nThen at τ=1, y=0.\n\nNow from y=0, I can go U, D, or S.\n\nIf I go S, stay y=0, safe but not progressing.\n\nIf go D, but y=0, go down? y=0, if go D, y=0 still? y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, and y in [0,9], so if at y=0, go D, y_{t+1} = max(0, y_t -1) =0, so stay 0.\n\nSimilarly, go S, stay 0.\n\nGo U, to y=1.\n\nBut at τ=1, y=1 is unsafe, so I cannot go to y=1 at τ=1? At τ=1, I am at y=0, which is safe.\n\nNow I choose action at τ=1 for next position at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=1, I am at y=0.\n\nAction a_{t_1 + τ} for τ from 0, but τ is index.\n\nAt turn relative τ, I take action a_{t_1 + τ}, which determines y for τ+1.\n\nPosition at time τ is y_τ.\n\nThen I take action a_τ, which sets y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy with Δy based on a_τ.\n\nAnd collision at time τ if on freeway y_τ and unsafe at τ.\n\nIn this case, at τ=1, I am at y=0, not a freeway, so no collision.\n\nThen I take action, say U, then y_{2} = y_1 +1 = 0+1=1.\n\nNow at τ=2, y=1, and I need freeway 1 safe at τ=2.\n\nFrom above, freeway 1 unsafe only at τ=1, so at τ=2, it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways.\n\nLet's find for each y and τ when it is safe.\n\nSince the unsafe times are sparse, I can plan a path.\n\nStart: τ=0, y=1. Freeway 1 at τ=0 safe, so I can be there.\n\nNow, must go down to avoid τ=1 for y=1-5.\n\nAt τ=0, action: to avoid being on y=1 to 5 at τ=1, since I can only go to y=0,1,2 from y=1, and y=1 and y=2 unsafe at τ=1, so only choice is go to y=0.\n\nSo action at τ=0: D, to y=0 at τ=1.\n\nNow τ=1: at y=0, safe.\n\nNow from here, I need to go up.\n\nAt τ=1, I can choose to go U, to y=1 at τ=2; or S, stay y=0; or D, stay y=0.\n\nIf I go U, to y=1 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=1: freeway 1 safe? Yes, unsafe only τ=1, so τ=2 safe.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to other places.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nAlso, there are unsafe times at τ=4 for y=3,4,5 and τ=6,7 for y=6,7,8.\n\nNow, let me list the safe times for each y.\n\ny=1: unsafe only at τ=1, so safe for τ=0,2,3,4,... except τ=1.\n\nτ=0 safe, τ=2 safe, etc.\n\ny=2: unsafe τ=1, so safe τ=0,2,3,4,...\n\ny=3: unsafe τ=1 and 4, so safe τ=0,2,3,5,6,... except τ=1 and 4.\n\nτ=0 safe, τ=2 safe, τ=3 safe, τ=4 unsafe, τ=5 safe, etc.\n\ny=4: same, unsafe τ=1,4, safe otherwise.\n\ny=5: same, unsafe τ=1,4.\n\ny=6: unsafe τ=6,7, safe for other τ.\n\ny=7: unsafe τ=6,7.\n\ny=8: unsafe τ=6,7.\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nNow, back to τ=1, I am at y=0.\n\nI should go up as soon as possible.\n\nAt τ=1, I can go U to y=1 at τ=2.\n\nAt τ=2, y=1 is safe, as above.\n\nThen from there, I can go up to y=2 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=2: freeway 2 unsafe only at τ=1, so τ=3 safe.\n\nThen go to y=3 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=4, y=3: but freeway 3 unsafe at τ=4! So cannot be at y=3 at τ=4.\n\nProblem.\n\nIf I go from y=2 at τ=3 to U, y=3 at τ=4, unsafe.\n\nIf at τ=3, y=2, I go S, stay y=2 at τ=4.\n\nBut y=2 at τ=4: freeway 2 safe, since unsafe only τ=1.\n\nSimilarly, I could go D to y=1 at τ=4, but y=1 safe at τ=4.\n\nBut I need to go up, so staying or going down delays.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nFrom y=0 at τ=1, I go U to y=1 at τ=2.\n\nThen at τ=2, y=1, I can go U to y=2 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=2, safe.\n\nNow at τ=3, if I go U to y=3 at τ=4, but y=3 unsafe at τ=4.\n\nSo I need to avoid being on y=3,4,5 at τ=4.\n\nOptions at τ=3, y=2:\n\n- Go U to y=3 at τ=4: unsafe\n\n- Go S to y=2 at τ=4: y=2 safe at τ=4, as above.\n\n- Go D to y=1 at τ=4: y=1 safe at τ=4.\n\nBut if I go S or D, I stay at lower y, which might take more turns.\n\nI could go to a different y.\n\nFor example, from y=2 at τ=3, I can go U, but unsafe at next, so not.\n\nPerhaps I should not go up so fast, or go to a safe y at τ=4.\n\ny=3,4,5 unsafe at τ=4.\n\ny=1,2,6,7,8 safe at τ=4.\n\ny=1: safe except τ=1, so τ=4 safe.\n\ny=2: safe except τ=1, τ=4 safe.\n\ny=6: unsafe τ=6,7, so τ=4 safe.\n\nSimilarly y=7,8 safe at τ=4.\n\ny=0 safe.\n\nBut from y=2 at τ=3, I can only go to y=1,2,3 at τ=4.\n\ny=1 and y=2 are safe at τ=4, y=3 unsafe.\n\nSo I can go to y=1 or y=2 at τ=4 by going D or S.\n\nFor example, go S to stay y=2 at τ=4, safe.\n\nThen later go up.\n\nBut I have to deal with τ=6,7 later.\n\nSince y=6,7,8 unsafe at τ=6 and 7, I need to avoid being there at those times.\n\nNow, let's think about the path.\n\nI am at τ=1, y=0.\n\nGo U at τ=1 to y=1 at τ=2. (action at τ=1 for y_{τ+1})\n\nAt τ=2, y=1, go U to y=2 at τ=3.\n\nAt τ=3, y=2, now I cannot go to y=3 at τ=4, so I must go to y=1 or y=2 at τ=4.\n\nSuppose I go S to stay y=2 at τ=4. Safe.\n\nThen at τ=4, y=2, I can go U to y=3 at τ=5.\n\nAt τ=5, y=3: freeway 3 unsafe at τ=1 and 4, τ=5 safe.\n\nSimilarly, go U to y=4 at τ=6.\n\nAt τ=6, y=4: freeway 4 unsafe at τ=1 and 4, τ=6 safe? τ=6, freeway 4 unsafe only at τ=1,4, so τ=6 safe.\n\nBut now at τ=6, I am going to y=4, but y=6,7,8 are unsafe at τ=6.\n\nBut I am at y=4, not affected.\n\nContinue: from y=4 at τ=6, I can go U to y=5 at τ=7.\n\nAt τ=7, y=5: freeway 5 unsafe at τ=1 and 4, τ=7 safe.\n\nThen go U to y=6 at τ=8.\n\nAt τ=8, y=6: freeway 6 unsafe at τ=6,7, so τ=8 safe.\n\nSimilarly, go U to y=7 at τ=9, safe since τ=9 not 6 or 7.\n\ny=7 unsafe τ=6,7, τ=9 safe.\n\nGo U to y=8 at τ=10, safe.\n\nGo U to y=9 at τ=11.\n\nNow, when do I reach y=9? At τ=11, y=9.\n\nBut I started from τ=0, and at τ=11, that's 12 turns including τ=0? Let's count the turns.\n\nτ from 0 to 11, that's 12 steps? No.\n\nτ is the time index, turn t_1 + τ.\n\nAt τ=0, position set.\n\nAfter H actions, I am at turn t_1 + H, position after H actions.\n\nI start at τ=0 (turn 23) with y=1.\n\nAfter first action, at τ=1 (turn 24), y new.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t_1 + k, position y_{t_1 + k}.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn, say after H actions, at turn t_1 + H.\n\nIn terms of τ, at time τ, y_τ.\n\nI need y_τ =9 for some τ.\n\nIn the sequence, I take actions from t=23 to t=23+H-1, and after H actions, I am at y=9 at turn t=23+H.\n\nThe position at turn T is before action or after? From the player update: at turn t, position (0, y_t), then I take action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy.\n\nAnd collision at turn t if on freeway y_t and unsafe at t.\n\nIn terms of τ, at time τ, I am at y_τ, and collision depends on y_τ and τ.\n\nThen I take action a_τ, go to y_{τ+1}.\n\nI reach when y_τ =9 for some τ.\n\nMinimal τ when I can be at y=9.\n\nIn the path above, I have:\n\nτ=0: y=1\n\naction D: go to y=0 at τ=1\n\nτ=1: y=0\n\naction U: go to y=1 at τ=2\n\nτ=2: y=1\n\naction U: go to y=2 at τ=3\n\nτ=3: y=2\n\naction S: go to y=2 at τ=4? action S, Δy=0, so y_{τ+1} = y_τ.\n\nAt τ=3, I take action, so for position at τ+1=4.\n\nLet's list actions and positions.\n\nDenote the action at time τ, which affects position at τ+1.\n\nPosition at τ is given, then action a_τ determines y_{τ+1}.\n\nAt τ=0: position y=1\n\nTake action a_0: let's say D, so y_{1} = 1 -1 =0\n\nAt τ=1: position y=0\n\nTake action a_1: U, so y_{2} = 0 +1 =1\n\nAt τ=2: position y=1\n\nTake action a_2: U, so y_{3} =1 +1=2\n\nAt τ=3: position y=2\n\nTake action a_3: S, so y_{4} =2 +0=2\n\nAt τ=4: position y=2\n\nTake action a_4: U, so y_{5} =2 +1=3\n\nAt τ=5: position y=3\n\nTake action a_5: U, so y_{6} =3+1=4\n\nAt τ=6: position y=4\n\nTake action a_6: U, so y_{7} =4+1=5\n\nAt τ=7: position y=5\n\nTake action a_7: U, so y_{8} =5+1=6\n\nAt τ=8: position y=6\n\nTake action a_8: U, so y_{9} =6+1=7\n\nAt τ=9: position y=7\n\nTake action a_9: U, so y_{10} =7+1=8\n\nAt τ=10: position y=8\n\nTake action a_10: U, so y_{11} =8+1=9\n\nAt τ=11: position y=9, reached.\n\nH is the number of actions to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nAfter H actions, I am at turn t_1 + H with y=9.\n\nIn this case, from τ=0 to τ=11, I took 11 actions (a_0 to a_10), and at τ=11, y=9.\n\nτ=11 is turn t_1 +11.\n\nThe sequence has actions from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1}, and after H actions, position at t_1 + H is (0,9).\n\nIn the answer format, it should be actions starting from turn t_1.\n\nIn this path, actions:\n\nAt turn t_1 + 0 =23: a=D (to y=0 at next turn)\n\nTurn t_1 +1 =24: a=U (to y=1 at turn 25)\n\nTurn t_1 +2 =25: a=U (to y=2 at turn 26)\n\nTurn t_1 +3 =26: a=S (to y=2 at turn 27)\n\nTurn t_1 +4 =27: a=U (to y=3 at turn 28)\n\nTurn t_1 +5 =28: a=U (to y=4 at turn 29)\n\nTurn t_1 +6 =29: a=U (to y=5 at turn 30)\n\nTurn t_1 +7 =30: a=U (to y=6 at turn 31)\n\nTurn t_1 +8 =31: a=U (to y=7 at turn 32)\n\nTurn t_1 +9 =32: a=U (to y=8 at turn 33)\n\nTurn t_1 +10 =33: a=U (to y=9 at turn 34)\n\nAnd at turn 34, y=9.\n\nH=11 actions.\n\nBut can I do better?\n\nFor example, at τ=3, instead of staying, I could go down to y=1 at τ=4.\n\nBut y=1 at τ=4 is safe, then go up, but similar.\n\nI could go up faster if I avoid τ=4.\n\nτ=4 is only unsafe for y=3,4,5.\n\nSo if I can be at y=2 or y=6 or above at τ=4.\n\nBut at τ=3, I am at y=2, I can only go to y=1,2,3 at τ=4.\n\ny=1 and 2 safe, y=3 unsafe.\n\nSo I have to be at y=1 or 2 at τ=4.\n\nSimilarly, for τ=6 and 7, y=6,7,8 unsafe.\n\nIn the above path, at τ=6, I am at y=4, which is safe, τ=7 at y=5, safe, τ=8 at y=6, but τ=8 is safe for y=6 since unsafe only τ=6,7.\n\nIn my earlier, at τ=8 y=6, safe.\n\nBut at τ=6, I am at y=4, not on y=6.\n\nNow, to reduce H, I need to reach y=9 earlier.\n\nMinimal τ to reach y=9 from y=1 is τ=8, with 8 up moves.\n\nBut with constraints.\n\nI start at τ=0, y=1.\n\nAfter 8 up moves, at τ=8, y=9.\n\nBut I need to be safe at all intermediate positions.\n\nNow, at which τ must I not be on certain y.\n\nFor example, at τ=1, I cannot be on y=1 to 5, as before.\n\nSo at τ=1, I must be at y=0 or y=6,7,8.\n\nBut from y=1 at τ=0, I can only reach y=0,1,2 at τ=1.\n\ny=0 is possible, y=1 and 2 not possible at τ=1.\n\ny=6,7,8 not reachable.\n\nSo must be at y=0 at τ=1.\n\nThen from y=0 at τ=1, I need to go to y=9 in 7 more moves? From τ=1 to τ=8, 7 moves to go from y=0 to y=9, which requires 9 steps? y=0 to y=9 is 9 up moves, but in 7 moves, I can only go up 7, to y=7, not 9.\n\nAfter τ=1, at y=0, I need to reach y=9 by some τ.\n\nMinimal τ to reach y=9 from y=0 is τ=9, with 9 up moves: at τ=1 y=0, after 1st U at τ=2 y=1, ..., after 9th U at τ=10 y=9.\n\nBut I can reach earlier if I start from higher.\n\nBut in this case, from τ=1 y=0.\n\nNow, also constraints at τ=4 and τ=6,7.\n\nFirst, to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nFrom y=0 at τ=1, I can go up as fast as possible.\n\nBut at τ=4, I need to avoid y=3,4,5.\n\nSimilarly at τ=6,7 avoid y=6,7,8.\n\nNow, suppose I go up directly from y=0 at τ=1.\n\na_1: U, to y=1 at τ=2\n\na_2: U, to y=2 at τ=3\n\na_3: U, to y=3 at τ=4 — but y=3 at τ=4 unsafe! Cannot.\n\nSo I need to not be on y=3,4,5 at τ=4.\n\nAt τ=3, I will be at y=2 or something.\n\nFrom y=0 at τ=1:\n\nTake a_1: U, to y=1 at τ=2\n\nThen at τ=2, y=1, take a_2: U, to y=2 at τ=3\n\nAt τ=3, y=2, now for τ=4, I need y_4 not 3,4,5.\n\nSo from y=2, I can go to y=1,2,3 at τ=4.\n\ny=1 and y=2 are safe at τ=4, y=3 unsafe.\n\nSo I can go to y=1 or y=2 at τ=4.\n\nSay go S to y=2 at τ=4.\n\nThen at τ=4, y=2, take a_4: U to y=3 at τ=5\n\nThen U to y=4 at τ=6\n\nAt τ=6, y=4: safe, since freeway 4 unsafe only τ=1,4, τ=6 safe.\n\nThen U to y=5 at τ=7\n\ny=5 at τ=7: freeway 5 unsafe τ=1,4, τ=7 safe.\n\nThen U to y=6 at τ=8\n\ny=6 at τ=8: freeway 6 unsafe τ=6,7, τ=8 safe.\n\nThen U to y=7 at τ=9\n\nU to y=8 at τ=10\n\nU to y=9 at τ=11\n\nSame as before, reach at τ=11.\n\nFrom τ=4 y=2, I could go U to y=3 at τ=5, but then to y=4 at τ=6, same.\n\nBut at τ=6, I need to avoid y=6,7,8? At τ=6, I am at y=4 or y=5, not on y=6,7,8, so safe.\n\nBut when I go to y=6 at τ=8, safe.\n\nTo reach earlier, I need to be at higher y faster.\n\nBut at τ=4, I am stuck at y=2 or below.\n\nSuppose at τ=3, y=2, I go D to y=1 at τ=4.\n\nThen at τ=4, y=1, safe.\n\nThen go U to y=2 at τ=5\n\nU to y=3 at τ=6\n\nAt τ=6, y=3: freeway 3 unsafe at τ=1,4, τ=6 safe.\n\nThen U to y=4 at τ=7\n\ny=4 at τ=7: safe.\n\nU to y=5 at τ=8\n\nU to y=6 at τ=9\n\nBut at τ=9, y=6 safe.\n\nThen U to y=7 at τ=10\n\nU to y=8 at τ=11\n\nU to y=9 at τ=12\n\nWorse, τ=12.\n\nNot better.\n\nFrom y=1 at τ=4, I could go directly up, but I have τ=6,7 to worry about, but y=3,4,5 are fine except at specific times.\n\nIn this case, from τ=4 y=1, go U to y=2 at τ=5, U to y=3 at τ=6, safe as above.\n\nBut to reach y=9, I need more steps.\n\nMinimal is 11 as first path.\n\nBut can I avoid the stay at τ=4?\n\nFor example, if I can be at y=6 at τ=4, but from start, at τ=0 y=1, go D to y=0 at τ=1.\n\nThen from y=0, to reach y=6 at τ=4, I need to go up 6 steps in 3 moves? From τ=1 y=0, to y at τ=4.\n\nAfter 3 actions: at τ=4, y_{4} = y_1 + Δy1 + Δy2 + Δy3\n\ny_1=0, then after actions.\n\nAt τ=1 y=0, take a1, to y2; take a2, to y3; take a3, to y4.\n\nTo have y4=6, I need three U, so y2=1, y3=2, y4=3? Not 6.\n\nMax I can be at y4 is y=3, with three U from y=0: y2=1, y3=2, y4=3.\n\nCannot be at y=6 at τ=4.\n\nSimilarly, cannot avoid being low at τ=4.\n\nNow, for τ=6 and 7, I need to avoid y=6,7,8 at those times.\n\nIn my first path, at τ=6, I am at y=4, τ=7 at y=5, not on y=6,7,8, so safe.\n\nThen at τ=8, I go to y=6, which is safe.\n\nBut I reach y=9 at τ=11.\n\nNow, to save time, perhaps I can be at higher y when τ=6 and 7.\n\nFor example, if I am at y=5 at τ=6, safe, or y=9.\n\nBut y=9 is the target.\n\nSuppose I reach y=9 before τ=6.\n\nMinimal to reach y=9 from start: from y=1 at τ=0, with 8 U, at τ=8 y=9.\n\nBut I need to be safe at all τ from 0 to 8.\n\nAt τ=0, y=1 safe.\n\nAt τ=1, must not be on y=1-5, but to reach y=9 at τ=8, I need to go through y=1 to 8 at some points.\n\nSpecifically, at τ=1, I need to be at some y not 1-5, but only possible y=0, as before.\n\nSo at τ=1, y=0.\n\nThen from there, to reach y=9 at τ=8, I need from y=0 at τ=1 to y=9 at τ=8, which is 7 moves, but y=0 to y=9 is 9 levels, so in 7 moves I can gain at most 7, to y=7, not 9.\n\nImpossible to reach y=9 at τ=8.\n\nSimilarly, earliest possible is τ=9 or later.\n\nAt τ=9, y=9: from y=0 at τ=1, need 9 up moves in 8 moves? From τ=1 to τ=9, 8 steps.\n\ny at τ=1 is 0, after 8 actions, y at τ=9.\n\nTo be y=9 at τ=9, I need to increase by 9 in 8 moves, so possible with 8 up and one stay? But actions: each action changes y by at most +1, so after k actions, y <= y_initial + k.\n\nHere y_initial at τ=1 is 0, after 8 actions, y <= 8, so at τ=9, y <=8, cannot be 9.\n\ny at τ=1: 0\n\nAfter action a1 at τ=1, to y2\n\na2 to y3\n\n...\n\na8 to y9\n\ny9 = y1 + sum_{i=1 to 8} Δy_i\n\ny1=0, Δy_i <=1, so y9 <= 8.\n\nCannot be 9 at τ=9.\n\nSimilarly, at τ=10, y10 = y1 + sum_{i=1 to 9} Δy_i <= 0 + 9 =9, so possible with all U.\n\nSimilarly at τ=11, <=11, easy.\n\nSo minimal possible τ to reach y=9 is τ=10, with all up moves except one down or stay, but since I have to go down at start, probably not all up.\n\nFrom above, to reach y=9 at τ=10: y10=9.\n\nSince y1=0 at τ=1 (after first down), then I need y10 = y1 + sum_{i=1 to 9} Δy_i = 0 + sum =9, so sum of 9 Δy_i must be +9, so all U from τ=1 to τ=9.\n\nActions from τ=1 to τ=9, 9 actions to go to y10.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nStart: τ=0: y=1, action a0=D, to y1=0 at τ=1\n\nThen at τ=1: position y=0, take a1=U to y2=1 at τ=2\n\na2=U to y3=2 at τ=3\n\na3=U to y4=3 at τ=4 — but y4=3 at τ=4, unsafe! Cannot.\n\nBecause freeway 3 unsafe at τ=4.\n\nSo I cannot be at y=3 at τ=4.\n\nIf I take a3=S or D at τ=3, then y4 not 3.\n\nFor example, at τ=3, y3=2, if I take S, y4=2, safe at τ=4.\n\nThen I need to go up later, but to reach y=10=9, I need from y4=2 at τ=4 to y10=9, which is +7 in 6 moves, possible with 7 up but only 6 moves? From τ=4 to τ=10, 6 actions to go from y4 to y10.\n\ny10 = y4 + sum_{i=4 to 9} Δy_i for actions from τ=4 to τ=9? Let's index.\n\nPosition at τ=4: y4\n\nTake actions a4 to a9, 6 actions, to y5 to y10.\n\ny10 = y4 + Δy4 + ... + Δy9\n\nTo have y10=9, y4=2, so need sum of 6 Δy = +7, impossible since each <=1, max +6.\n\ny10 <= y4 +6 =2+6=8 <9.\n\nCannot reach y=9 at τ=10 if y4=2.\n\nIf at τ=4, y4=1, then y10 <=1+6=7<9.\n\nWorse.\n\nIf I can have higher y at τ=4.\n\nBut at τ=4, y must be 1,2,6,7,8 to be safe.\n\ny=6,7,8 possible? But from start, at τ=4, I can be at y=3 max with all up, but y=3 unsafe, so I can be at y=2 or 1.\n\nCannot be at y=6,7,8 at τ=4.\n\nSo y4 <=2 and y4 !=3, so y4=1 or 2.\n\nThen y10 <= y4 +6 <= 2+6=8 <9.\n\nThus impossible to reach y=9 at τ=10.\n\nAt τ=11, possible.\n\ny11=9.\n\ny11 = y1 + sum_{i=1 to 10} Δy_i\n\ny1=0, so need sum_{i=1 to 10} Δy_i =9, so 9 up and one stay or down, but since we need to reach 9, probably 9 up and one extra action, but with 10 actions, sum=9 means 9 up and one stay, or 10 up but y1=0, to y11=10, too high.\n\ny11 = y1 + sum_{i=1 to 10} Δy_i\n\ny1=0, y11=9, so sum_{i=1 to 10} Δy_i =9.\n\nSince each Δy_i >= -1, to have sum=9, with 10 terms, it must be nine +1 and one 0, or ten +1 but sum=10>9, not possible, so must have one stay and nine up.\n\nThus, in the actions from τ=1 to τ=10, I have nine U and one S.\n\nNow, I need to place the S such that I avoid the unsafe times.\n\nSimilarly, I have to avoid being on y=3,4,5 at τ=4, and y=6,7,8 at τ=6,7.\n\nIn the first path I had, I used a S at τ=3, which is a3=S, to stay at y=2 from τ=3 to τ=4.\n\nThat S is the extra action.\n\nIn that case, with H=11, it works.\n\nCan I do with H=10? That is, reach at τ=10.\n\nBut from above, y10 <= y1 +9 =0+9=9, but y1=0, y10 = y1 + sum_{i=1 to 9} Δy_i <= 0+9=9.\n\nTo have y10=9, need sum_{i=1 to 9} Δy_i =9, so all nine actions U.\n\nBut earlier, with all U from τ=1: y2=1, y3=2, y4=3, but y4=3 at τ=4 unsafe.\n\nCannot.\n\nIf I have a down or stay earlier, but with all U required, no room.\n\nThus impossible to reach at τ=10.\n\nTherefore minimal H is 11, reaching at τ=11.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I need to output the actions.\n\nIn my first sequence:\n\nActions:\n\nAt turn t_1 + 0 =23: D\n\nt_1 +1 =24: U\n\nt_1 +2 =25: U\n\nt_1 +3 =26: S  (this is at τ=3, action to stay)\n\nIn terms of the action index.\n\nThe action at time t determines the next position.\n\nFor turn t, action a_t.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nIn this case, H=11 actions, from t=23 to t=33.\n\nActions:\n\nt=23: a = D  (to y=0 at t=24)\n\nt=24: a = U  (to y=1 at t=25)\n\nt=25: a = U  (to y=2 at t=26)\n\nt=26: a = S  (to y=2 at t=27)  // stay to avoid τ=4 at y=3\n\nt=27: a = U  (to y=3 at t=28)\n\nt=28: a = U  (to y=4 at t=29)\n\nt=29: a = U  (to y=5 at t=30)\n\nt=30: a = U  (to y=6 at t=31)\n\nt=31: a = U  (to y=7 at t=32)\n\nt=32: a = U  (to y=8 at t=33)\n\nt=33: a = U  (to y=9 at t=34)\n\nAt t=34, y=9.\n\nBut t=34 is turn t_1 + 11, since t_1=23, 23+11=34.\n\nIn the sequence, actions up to t=33.\n\nI need to confirm the collisions.\n\nAt each turn, position and if on freeway, check safe.\n\nτ relative to t_1=23.\n\nTurn t=23: τ=0, y=1, freeway 1 safe at τ=0, ok.\n\nAction D, to y=0 at t=24.\n\nt=24: τ=1, y=0, not freeway, safe.\n\nAction U, to y=1 at t=25.\n\nt=25: τ=2, y=1, freeway 1 safe at τ=2 (not 1), ok.\n\nAction U, to y=2 at t=26.\n\nt=26: τ=3, y=2, freeway 2 safe at τ=3 (unsafe only τ=1), ok.\n\nAction S, to y=2 at t=27.\n\nt=27: τ=4, y=2, freeway 2 safe at τ=4, ok.\n\nAction U, to y=3 at t=28.\n\nt=28: τ=5, y=3, freeway 3 unsafe at τ=1 and 4, τ=5 safe, ok.\n\nAction U, to y=4 at t=29.\n\nt=29: τ=6, y=4, freeway 4 unsafe at τ=1 and 4, τ=6 safe, ok.\n\nAction U, to y=5 at t=30.\n\nt=30: τ=7, y=5, freeway 5 unsafe at τ=1 and 4, τ=7 safe, ok.\n\nAction U, to y=6 at t=31.\n\nt=31: τ=8, y=6, freeway 6 unsafe at τ=6,7, τ=8 safe, ok.\n\nAction U, to y=7 at t=32.\n\nt=32: τ=9, y=7, freeway 7 unsafe at τ=6,7, τ=9 safe, ok.\n\nAction U, to y=8 at t=33.\n\nt=33: τ=10, y=8, freeway 8 unsafe at τ=6,7, τ=10 safe, ok.\n\nAction U, to y=9 at t=34.\n\nt=34: y=9, reached, not freeway.\n\nAll safe.\n\nNow, is there a shorter sequence?\n\nSuppose I can avoid the stay by going down or something, but that might not help.\n\nFor example, at τ=3, y=2, instead of S, go D to y=1 at τ=4.\n\nThen at τ=4, y=1, safe.\n\nThen I need to go up from there.\n\nBut from y=1 at τ=4, go U to y=2 at τ=5, U to y=3 at τ=6, etc., but at τ=6, y=3, safe, but then to reach y=9, I need more steps: at τ=6 y=3, then after U,U,U,U,U,U to y=9 at τ=12? Let's see.\n\nτ=4: y=1\n\na4: U to y=2 at τ=5\n\na5: U to y=3 at τ=6\n\na6: U to y=4 at τ=7\n\na7: U to y=5 at τ=8\n\na8: U to y=6 at τ=9\n\na9: U to y=7 at τ=10\n\na10: U to y=8 at τ=11\n\na11: U to y=9 at τ=12\n\nReach at τ=12, worse than 11.\n\nNot better.\n\nTo handle τ=6,7, but in the first path, I was not on y=6,7,8 at τ=6,7, so fine.\n\nSuppose I go up faster to be at y=5 or something before τ=6.\n\nBut at τ=4, I am at y=2, then I go to y=3 at τ=5, y=4 at τ=6, y=5 at τ=7, both safe, then y=6 at τ=8, safe, same as before.\n\nNo gain.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=8 or 9 before τ=6.\n\nBut from start, impossible to reach high y early.\n\nFor example, at τ=5, what is the highest I can be.\n\nFrom τ=1 y=0, after 4 actions: to y5.\n\ny5 <= y1 +4 =4.\n\nAt τ=5, y<=4.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be high.\n\nSo the first path seems optimal with H=11.\n\nNow, about freeway 8, I think I covered.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 8, I have cars, but I used only that unsafe at τ=6,7, which is fine.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions.\n\nIn the answer, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\netc.\n\nt_1=23.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 23: D\n\nTurn 24: U\n\nTurn 25: U\n\nTurn 26: S\n\nTurn 27: U\n\nTurn 28: U\n\nTurn 29: U\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nTurn 33: U\n\nAnd at turn 34, y=9.\n\nBut the last action is at turn 33, to go to y=9 at turn 34.\n\nNow, H=11 actions.\n\nBut in the sequence, it should be from turn 23 to turn 33, 11 actions.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut in the format, it says \"a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1\", so t from 0.\n\nIn the answer format: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc.\n\nSo for t=23 to 33.\n\nBut let me confirm if I can reduce by one.\n\nSuppose at τ=0, instead of going down, but I have to, because at τ=1, y=1 and 2 unsafe.\n\nUnless I stay, but y=1 unsafe at τ=1.\n\nNo choice.\n\nPerhaps I can go up to y=3 or something later, but I think 11 is minimal.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps at τ=0, go S to stay at y=1, but at τ=1, y=1 unsafe, collide.\n\nCannot.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nNow, about the cars on freeway 3,4,5, I have three cars, but I think I handled the unsafe times correctly.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo the sequence should be as above.\n\nNow, to write the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 23\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on an unsafe freeway at any turn where cars occupy \\(x = 0\\).\n\n### Key Constraints from Car Movements:\n- **Freeway 1 (y=1) and Freeway 2 (y=2)**: Unsafe only at relative turn \\(\\tau = 1\\) (absolute turn 24).\n- **Freeway 3 (y=3), Freeway 4 (y=4), Freeway 5 (y=5)**: Unsafe at \\(\\tau = 1\\) and \\(\\tau = 4\\) (turns 24 and 27).\n- **Freeway 6 (y=6), Freeway 7 (y=7), Freeway 8 (y=8)**: Unsafe at \\(\\tau = 6\\) and \\(\\tau = 7\\) (turns 29 and 30).\n- Positions \\(y = 0\\) and \\(y = 9\\) are always safe, as they are not freeways.\n\n### Optimal Path:\n- At \\(\\tau = 0\\) (turn 23), start at \\(y = 1\\).

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 24, and the player is at (0,0). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to 8).\n\nThe player can move up (U: +1 in y), down (D: -1 in y), or stay (S: 0). The y-coordinate is bounded between 0 and 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at that turn, and there is a car on that freeway such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nImportant note: when moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, the player is only considered to be on y_T at turn T, and on y_{T+1} at turn T+1. So, if at turn T you move to a new row, you are only checked against the car on the row you are leaving (y_T) at turn T, and then at turn T+1 you are on the new row (y_{T+1}) and checked against that row's cars.\n\nWe are given the car state at turn t1=24. We need to compute the car spans at future turns.\n\nLet me denote the current turn as t0 = 24.\n\nFor each car, we are given:\n  (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nBut note: the representation for left and right is different.\n\nFor left-moving cars (d='left'):\n  At turn t0, the car span is [h, τ] (with h > τ, because the car moves left and the head is at a higher x than the tail? Actually, the problem says: \n    Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n  But note that in the example for freeway 1: (-24, 11, left, 36). \n    At T=24: [h, τ] = [-24, 11] -> but then the car would extend from -24 to 11? That doesn't make sense because -24 < 11, so the car is from -24 to 11? \n  However, the update rule for left: \n      Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n  At T=24: [ -24, 11 ] -> so the car is from -24 to 11? That's a length of 35? \n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"head\" and \"tail\". For a left-moving car, the head is at the leftmost? Actually, the update rule for left-moving: \n  [h, τ] becomes [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)] -> so the entire car moves left by s*(T-t1) units.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: \n  [τ, h] becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] -> so the entire car moves right by s*(T-t1) units.\n\nBut note the representation: \n  For left-moving: they give (head, tail) as (h, τ). But in the example: (-24, 11) for a left-moving car. \n      At t0=24: the car is from x = -24 to x = 11? That's a long car? \n\nHowever, the collision condition is: at turn T, if the player is on freeway k (which has this car) and the player's x=0 is in the span of the car at turn T.\n\nSo we need to compute for each freeway and each car the span at any future turn T.\n\nLet me write a function for a car:\n\nFor a car at freeway k, given (h0, t0, d, s) at time t1=24, then at time T (>=24):\n\nIf d == 'left':\n  span_low = τ - s*(T-24)\n  span_high = h - s*(T-24)   [since h is the head and τ the tail, and as the car moves left, both decrease]\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \n  Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → so at t1, the car occupies from h to τ? \n  But in the example: h=-24, τ=11 -> so the car is from -24 to 11? That is from x=-24 to x=11? Then the length is 35? \n\nBut then the update: \n  Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)] = [-24 - 36*(T-24), 11 - 36*(T-24)]\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: \n  They give (h, τ) but the problem says: for right-moving, the representation is [τ, h] at t1? \n  Actually, the table gives: for freeway 3: (0, -11, right, 12) -> so h=0, τ=-11? \n  Then the span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-11, 0]? \n  But the problem says: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, ...)\" so for right-moving, the head is at h and the tail at τ? \n  Then the update rule: \n      Span(T) = [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] = [-11 + 12*(T-24), 0 + 12*(T-24)]\n\nBut wait, the problem states for right-moving: \n      Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nSo the initial representation for a right-moving car is: (head=h, tail=τ) meaning the head is at h and the tail at τ? Then the car spans from τ to h? So if τ < h, then the car is from τ to h.\n\nIn freeway 3: (0, -11, right, 12): so h=0, τ=-11 -> so the car is from -11 to 0? \n\nSimilarly, the other cars.\n\nNow, we have:\n\nFreeway 1: car: (-24, 11, left, 36) -> at T: [ -24 - 36*(T-24), 11 - 36*(T-24) ]\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars:\n  car1: (0, -11, right, 12) -> at T: [ -11 + 12*(T-24), 0 + 12*(T-24) ]\n  car2: (-36, -47, right, 12) -> [ -47 + 12*(T-24), -36 + 12*(T-24) ]\n  car3: (48, 37, right, 12) -> [37 + 12*(T-24), 48 + 12*(T-24)]\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (-30, -41, right, 6) -> [ -41 + 6*(T-24), -30 + 6*(T-24) ]\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars:\n  car1: (-30, -41, right, 6) -> same as above: [ -41 + 6*(T-24), -30 + 6*(T-24) ]\n  car2: (36, 25, right, 6) -> [25 + 6*(T-24), 36 + 6*(T-24)]\n\nWe need to avoid being on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at a turn T when 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nThe player starts at (0,0) at turn 24. We are at y=0, which is not a freeway (freeways are y=1..8). So we are safe at turn 24.\n\nGoal: reach y=9. Note that y=9 is the top, and there are no freeways above, so we don't have to worry about cars at y=9.\n\nWe are allowed to move up, down, or stay. We cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nWe want the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions.\n\nSince we start at 0 and need to get to 9, the minimal moves without any obstacles would be 9 moves of 'U'. But we have obstacles on the freeways.\n\nWe must avoid the freeways at the turns when the cars cover x=0.\n\nWe can also wait (stay) or even move down if necessary to avoid a collision.\n\nBut note: we start at turn 24, and we are at y=0. We can only move to y=1 at the next turn (if we choose U) and then we are on freeway 1 at turn 25.\n\nSo let's compute for each freeway the times T (>=24) when the freeway is blocked (i.e., at least one car on that freeway has 0 in its span).\n\nWe'll compute for freeways 1 to 8.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: left-moving: [ -24 -36*(T-24), 11 -36*(T-24) ]\n\nWe need to check when 0 is in [A, B] where A = -24 -36*(T-24) and B = 11 -36*(T-24). Note: since the car moves left, A < B? Actually, at T=24: A=-24, B=11 -> so A<=B. But as T increases, both A and B decrease. We require A <= 0 <= B.\n\nSo:\n  A <= 0 -> -24 -36*(T-24) <= 0 -> -36*(T-24) <= 24 -> multiply by -1 (reverse inequality): 36*(T-24) >= -24 -> which is always true? \n  But wait: -24 -36*(T-24) <= 0 -> -36*(T-24) <= 24 -> then we can divide by 36 (positive) -> -(T-24) <= 24/36 -> -(T-24) <= 2/3 -> T-24 >= -2/3 -> always true for T>=24.\n\nBut we also require 0 <= B -> 0 <= 11 -36*(T-24) -> 36*(T-24) <= 11 -> T-24 <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305 -> so T <= 24 + 0.305 = 24.305.\n\nSince T is integer, T=24 only.\n\nAt T=24: \n  A = -24, B = 11 -> 0 is in [-24,11] -> blocked at T=24? \n\nBut note: at T=24, we are at y=0, so we are not on freeway 1. So we don't care about freeway 1 at T=24.\n\nAt T=25: \n  A = -24 -36 = -60, B = 11-36 = -25 -> the span is [-60, -25] -> 0 is not in this interval.\n\nSo freeway 1 is blocked only at T=24? But we are not on it at T=24. So freeway 1 is safe for T>=25.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1 -> safe for T>=25.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars.\n\nCar1: (0, -11, right, 12) -> [ -11 + 12*(T-24), 0 + 12*(T-24) ]\n  We need 0 in [A, B] = [ -11 + 12*(T-24), 12*(T-24) ]\n  Conditions:\n    A <= 0 <= B -> \n    Condition1: -11 + 12*(T-24) <= 0 -> 12*(T-24) <= 11 -> T-24 <= 11/12 ≈ 0.916 -> T <= 24.916 -> so T=24,25?\n    Condition2: 0 <= 12*(T-24) -> T-24>=0 -> always for T>=24.\n\n  So at T=24: A = -11, B=0 -> 0 is in [-11,0]? Yes, because it's inclusive? The problem says \"if 0 in Span(T)\". The span is a closed interval? We assume inclusive.\n\n    But note: at T=24: the car is from -11 to 0. So 0 is included? Then blocked at T=24.\n\n  At T=25: A = -11+12=1, B=12 -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nCar2: (-36, -47, right, 12) -> [ -47 + 12*(T-24), -36 + 12*(T-24) ]\n  We need 0 in [A, B] = [ -47+12k, -36+12k] where k=T-24.\n  Conditions:\n    A <= 0 <= B -> \n    -47+12k <= 0 -> 12k <= 47 -> k <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916 -> k<=3 -> T<=27\n    and 0 <= -36+12k -> 12k>=36 -> k>=3 -> T>=27\n\n  So k>=3 and k<=3.916 -> k=3 -> T=27.\n\n  At T=27: \n      A = -47+12*3 = -47+36 = -11\n      B = -36+36 = 0\n      So 0 is in [-11,0] -> blocked at T=27.\n\nCar3: (48,37,right,12) -> [37+12k, 48+12k] \n  We need 0 in [37+12k, 48+12k] -> \n      37+12k <= 0 <= 48+12k -> \n      But 37+12k <=0 -> 12k <= -37 -> k <= -37/12 -> negative -> not possible for k>=0.\n\nSo freeway 3 is blocked at T=24 and T=27.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 and 5 are same as freeway 3 -> blocked at T=24 and T=27.\n\nNow freeway 6: one car: (-30, -41, right, 6) -> [ -41+6k, -30+6k] \n  Conditions for 0:\n    -41+6k <= 0 <= -30+6k\n    => 6k <=41 -> k<=41/6≈6.833 -> k<=6\n    and 0<= -30+6k -> 6k>=30 -> k>=5\n\n  So k in [5,6] -> k=5,6 -> T=29,30.\n\n  At T=29: A = -41+30 = -11, B=-30+30=0 -> 0 in [-11,0] -> blocked.\n  At T=30: A = -41+36 = -5, B=-30+36=6 -> 0 in [-5,6] -> blocked.\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway 6 -> blocked at T=29,30.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars.\n\nCar1: (-30,-41,right,6) -> same as above: [ -41+6k, -30+6k] -> blocked at T=29,30.\n\nCar2: (36,25,right,6) -> [25+6k, 36+6k] \n  Conditions: 25+6k<=0<=36+6k -> \n      25+6k<=0 -> k<=-25/6 -> impossible.\n\nSo freeway 8 is blocked at T=29,30.\n\nSummary of blocked freeways by turn:\n\nTurn 24: freeways 3,4,5 (because of car1 on each) -> but note: at turn 24, we are at y=0, so we are safe. But if we are on freeway 3,4,5 at turn 24, we would be hit. However, we are at y=0.\n\nTurn 27: freeways 3,4,5 (because of car2 on each) -> so if we are on freeway 3,4,5 at turn 27, we get hit.\n\nTurn 29: freeways 6,7,8 (because of car1 on each) \nTurn 30: freeways 6,7,8\n\nNow, note that we can also be on a freeway at other times? But the above are the only times when 0 is covered by a car on that freeway.\n\nWe need to get from y=0 to y=9. The minimal path would be to go up 9 times. But we must avoid being on a freeway at the blocked turns.\n\nWe start at turn 24 at y=0.\n\nAt turn 24: we choose an action. The action we choose at turn 24 will determine our position at turn 25.\n\nWe want to minimize the total turns.\n\nWe can consider the state (turn, y) and try to find the shortest path (in terms of moves) to y=9, avoiding collisions.\n\nThe actions: U, D, S. The cost per move is 1, and we want to minimize the total turns.\n\nNote: we can only move one step at a time.\n\nWe'll simulate from turn 24 onward.\n\nWe note the blocked (turn, y) pairs:\n\nFor y=3,4,5: blocked at turn 24 and 27. But at turn 24 we are not on these freeways (we are at y=0). So the danger is at turn 27.\n\nFor y=6,7,8: blocked at turn 29 and 30.\n\nWe start at (turn=24, y=0).\n\nWe can do:\n\nOption 1: Go straight up as fast as possible.\n\nTurn 24: U -> y=1 at turn 25? \n  At turn 25: we are at y=1. \n  Is y=1 blocked at turn 25? \n      Freeway 1: we computed that it is safe at T>=25 -> so no car at turn 25 on freeway1? \n      We computed for freeway1: only blocked at T=24 -> so at T=25: safe.\n\nTurn 25: U -> y=2 at turn 26.\n  Freeway2: same as freeway1 -> safe at T>=25 -> so at turn26 we are on freeway2? \n      Actually, at turn25 we were at y=1 (freeway1) and we moved to y=2 at turn26: \n        At turn25: we were on freeway1 -> no collision (freeway1 safe at turn25).\n        At turn26: we are on freeway2 -> freeway2 safe at turn26? Yes, because only blocked at turn24.\n\nTurn26: U -> y=3 at turn27.\n  At turn27: we are on freeway3 -> but freeway3 is blocked at turn27! -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot be on freeway3 at turn27.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid being on freeways 3,4,5 at turn27.\n\nSimilarly, avoid freeways 6,7,8 at turns29 and 30.\n\nWe need to either wait or take a detour.\n\nWe might wait at some safe position until the danger passes.\n\nSince we have to avoid freeways 3,4,5 at turn27, we can:\n\nOption: get to y=2 by turn26, then wait at y=2 (freeway2) for one turn? \n  But freeway2 is safe at all turns after 24? Yes. \n  Then at turn27: we are at y=2 (by staying at turn26: so at turn26 we are at y=2, then at turn27 we choose S -> stay at y=2).\n\nThen at turn28: we can move up.\n\nBut we also have to avoid freeways 6,7,8 at turns29 and 30.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn24: U -> y=1 at turn25 (safe: freeway1 safe at turn25)\nTurn25: U -> y=2 at turn26 (freeway2 safe at turn26)\nTurn26: S -> stay at y=2 (freeway2 safe at turn27? We are at y=2 at turn27: freeway2 is safe at turn27? \n        We computed freeway2 is safe at all T>=25 -> so safe.\n\nTurn27: U -> y=3 at turn28 (so at turn27 we are still at y=2, then we move to y=3 at turn28)\n  At turn27: we are at y=2 -> safe (freeway2 safe at turn27).\n  At turn28: we are at y=3 -> freeway3: is freeway3 safe at turn28? \n        We computed freeway3 is blocked only at T=24 and T=27 -> so at T=28: safe.\n\nTurn28: U -> y=4 at turn29\n  At turn29: we are at freeway4 -> blocked? \n        Freeway4 is blocked at T=24 and T=27 -> not at T=29 -> safe.\n\nBut wait: we are at freeway4 at turn29 -> and freeway4 is safe at turn29? \n        We computed: freeway4 same as freeway3 -> blocked only at 24 and 27 -> so safe at 29.\n\nThen turn29: U -> y=5 at turn30\n  At turn30: freeway5 -> blocked? freeway5 blocked at T=24,27 -> safe at T=30.\n\nThen turn30: U -> y=6 at turn31\n  At turn31: freeway6 -> blocked? freeway6 is blocked at T=29 and 30 -> at T=31: \n        For freeway6: car: [ -41+6*(T-24), -30+6*(T-24) ] at T=31: \n            k=7: [-41+42=1, -30+42=12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nThen we can continue:\n\nturn31: U -> y=7 at turn32\nturn32: U -> y=8 at turn33\nturn33: U -> y=9 at turn34 -> done.\n\nBut wait, at turn30 we are at y=5 (freeway5) and we move to y=6 at turn31? \n  At turn30: we are at freeway5? \n      Actually, at turn29 we were at y=4 (freeway4) and then we moved to y=5 at turn30 -> so at turn30 we are at freeway5 -> safe (because freeway5 is only blocked at 24 and 27).\n\nThen at turn30: we do U -> then at turn31 we are at y=6 (freeway6). \n  Freeway6: at turn31: k=31-24=7 -> [ -41+6*7 = -41+42=1, -30+42=12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nThen turn31: U -> y=7 at turn32 -> freeway7: \n      Freeway7: same as freeway6? \n          Car: [ -41+6k, -30+6k] at k=8: [-41+48=7, -30+48=18] -> safe.\n\nturn32: U -> y=8 at turn33 -> freeway8: \n      Freeway8: two cars. \n          Car1: same as freeway6: [ -41+6*9 = -41+54=13, -30+54=24] -> safe (0 not in [13,24])\n          Car2: [25+6*9=25+54=79, 36+54=90] -> safe.\n\nturn33: U -> y=9 at turn34 -> done.\n\nTotal turns: from turn24 to turn34: 10 turns? But we count the actions: \n  We do 10 actions: at turns 24,25,...,33 -> 10 actions? \n  But we start at turn24 and we do actions at turn24 to turn33 (10 actions) and then at turn34 we have reached.\n\nBut the problem says: we are at turn t1=24, and we do actions for t=0 to H-1, meaning we do H actions, and then at the next turn (turn24+H) we are at (0,9).\n\nWe require: at turn24+H-1 we are at (0,9). Actually, the sequence of actions is for t=0 to H-1, meaning we do H actions: \n  After H actions, we are at turn24+H, and we have done H moves.\n\nBut the position after H moves: we start at (0,0) at turn24, then after one action (at turn24) we are at turn25 at y1 = y0 + Δy0.\n\nSo after H moves, we are at turn24+H, and we are at y = 0 + (number of U - number of D).\n\nWe require y=9 at turn24+H.\n\nIn the above plan:\n\nAt turn24: action U -> turn25: y=1\nturn25: U -> turn26: y=2\nturn26: S -> turn27: y=2\nturn27: U -> turn28: y=3\nturn28: U -> turn29: y=4\nturn29: U -> turn30: y=5\nturn30: U -> turn31: y=6\nturn31: U -> turn32: y=7\nturn32: U -> turn33: y=8\nturn33: U -> turn34: y=9\n\nSo at turn34, we are at y=9. So H = 10? Because we did 10 actions: from turn24 to turn33.\n\nBut we can try to see if we can do it faster.\n\nMinimal moves: we need 9 moves of U. But we had to wait one turn (at turn26: S) to avoid being at freeway3 at turn27. So total moves: 9 U and 1 S -> 10 moves.\n\nCan we avoid the wait? \n\nWe could go up faster? But we started at y0=0 at turn24. We need to get to y=9. \n\nIf we do 9 consecutive U, we would be:\n\nturn24: U -> turn25: y=1\nturn25: U -> turn26: y=2\nturn26: U -> turn27: y=3 -> but freeway3 blocked at turn27 -> crash.\n\nWe could go up to y=2 by turn26, then at turn27 we must not be on freeways 3,4,5. We can either stay at y=2 or go down to y=1? \n\nIf we go down to y=1 at turn27: \n  At turn26: y=2 (freeway2, safe at turn26) \n  Then at turn27: D -> then at turn27 we are at y=1 (freeway1). \n      Freeway1: safe at turn27? Yes (only blocked at turn24). \n  Then at turn28: we can go up to y=2 (freeway2) -> safe.\n  Then turn29: U to y=3 -> freeway3: safe at turn29? \n        Freeway3: blocked at 24 and 27 -> so at turn29: safe.\n\nThen we can proceed:\n\nturn24: U -> y1\nturn25: U -> y2\nturn26: U -> y3? No, we don't do that.\n\nInstead:\n\nturn24: U -> y=1 (turn25)\nturn25: U -> y=2 (turn26)\nturn26: D -> y=1 (turn27)  [to avoid being at y=3 at turn27? But we are at y=1 at turn27: safe? yes]\nturn27: U -> y=2 (turn28)\nturn28: U -> y=3 (turn29) -> safe (freeway3 safe at turn29)\nturn29: U -> y=4 (turn30) -> safe (freeway4 safe at turn30)\nturn30: U -> y=5 (turn31) -> safe\nturn31: U -> y=6 (turn32) -> freeway6: at turn32: k=32-24=8 -> [ -41+6*8= -41+48=7, -30+48=18] -> safe\nturn32: U -> y=7 (turn33) -> freeway7: same as freeway6 at k=9: [ -41+54=13, -30+54=24] -> safe\nturn33: U -> y=8 (turn34) -> freeway8: at k=10: \n        car1: [-41+60=19, -30+60=30] -> safe\n        car2: [25+60=85, 36+60=96] -> safe\nturn34: U -> y=9 (turn35)\n\nBut now we have 11 moves? And we end at turn35.\n\nThis is worse than the previous plan (which had 10 moves).\n\nWe could avoid going down and instead go up to y=5 or higher before turn27? \n\nWe start at y=0 at turn24.\n\nTo get to y=5, we need 5 moves. The earliest we can be at y=5 is at turn24+5 = turn29.\n\nBut at turn29, we are at freeway5? And freeway5 is safe at turn29? Yes, because blocked only at 24 and 27.\n\nBut we also have to avoid being on freeways 3,4 at the intermediate turns.\n\nLet me try:\n\nWe do 5 consecutive U:\n\nturn24: U -> turn25: y=1 (freeway1: safe)\nturn25: U -> turn26: y=2 (freeway2: safe)\nturn26: U -> turn27: y=3 -> freeway3 at turn27: blocked -> crash.\n\nSo we cannot.\n\nWe must avoid being at freeway3 at turn27.\n\nWhat if we go up to y=2 by turn26, then at turn26 we do S (stay) so that at turn27 we are at y=2 (safe), then at turn27 we start moving up again.\n\nThat was the first plan.\n\nWe can try to go up to y=3 at a time other than turn27? \n\nWe can get to y=3 at turn28? \n\nIn the first plan, we were at y=3 at turn28: safe.\n\nBut then we proceed to y=4 at turn29: safe, and so on.\n\nBut we are blocked at freeways 6,7,8 at turns29 and 30. \n\nIn the first plan, we are at y=4 at turn29 and y=5 at turn30 -> not on freeways 6,7,8 (which are y=6,7,8) at turns29 and 30 -> safe.\n\nSo the first plan is safe.\n\nIs there a way to do it in 9 moves? \n\nWe need 9 U moves. We must avoid being at freeway3 at turn27. \n\nThe only way to avoid being at freeway3 at turn27 is to not be at y=3 at turn27. \n\nBut to get to y=9 in 9 moves, we must be at y=3 at turn27: because:\n\nturn24: move0: y=1\nturn25: move1: y=2\nturn26: move2: y=3 -> so at turn26 we are at y=3? But then at turn27 we are still at y=3 (if we do nothing) or we move to y=4? \n\nActually, if we do 9 consecutive U:\n\nturn24: U -> turn25: y=1\nturn25: U -> turn26: y=2\nturn26: U -> turn27: y=3 -> crash.\n\nIf we do 9 moves but not consecutive? We could go up then down then up? But that would require more moves.\n\nWe could be at y=3 at a different turn? But to be at y=3 at a turn that is not 27, we must either be slower or faster? \n\nIf we go faster: we start at turn24: we can only do one move per turn. We cannot jump.\n\nThe only way is to be at y=3 at turn28? Then we do:\n\nturn24: U -> y1 at turn25\nturn25: U -> y2 at turn26\nturn26: S -> y2 at turn27 (so we avoid being at y=3 at turn27)\nturn27: U -> y3 at turn28 -> safe.\n\nThen we have to do 6 more U to get to y9: \n  turn28: U -> y4 at turn29\n  turn29: U -> y5 at turn30\n  turn30: U -> y6 at turn31\n  turn31: U -> y7 at turn32\n  turn32: U -> y8 at turn33\n  turn33: U -> y9 at turn34\n\nTotal moves: 9 U and 1 S -> 10 moves.\n\nSo minimal moves is 10.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid freeways 6,7,8 at turns29 and 30. \n\nIn the above, at turn29: we are at y=4 -> freeway4 -> safe (blocked only at 24 and 27). \nAt turn30: we are at y=5 -> freeway5 -> safe.\n\nThen at turn31: we are at y=6 -> freeway6 -> at turn31: we computed safe (k=7: [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12]).\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of actions for 10 moves:\n\nTurn24: U\nTurn25: U\nTurn26: S\nTurn27: U\nTurn28: U\nTurn29: U\nTurn30: U\nTurn31: U\nTurn32: U\nTurn33: U\n\nBut we end at turn34: y=9.\n\nWe must write the actions for turns: t1 (24) to t1+9 (33).\n\nBut the problem says: sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}. Here H=10, so t from 0 to 9.\n\nt0 = 24: a_{24} = U\nt1 = 25: a_{25} = U\nt2 = 26: a_{26} = S\nt3 = 27: a_{27} = U\nt4 = 28: a_{28} = U\nt5 = 29: a_{29} = U\nt6 = 30: a_{30} = U\nt7 = 31: a_{31} = U\nt8 = 32: a_{32} = U\nt9 = 33: a_{33} = U\n\nBut the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 24: a_{24}\nTurn 25: a_{25}\n...\n}\n\nWe write:\n\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: S\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\n\nIs there a way to do it in 10 moves without the stay? \n\nAlternatively, we could do:\n\nAt turn24: U -> y1\nturn25: U -> y2\nturn26: U -> y3 -> but then at turn26 we are at y3? \n      At turn26: freeway3 -> is it blocked? \n          Freeway3: blocked at T=24 and T=27 -> not at T=26? \n          At T=26: k=2 -> \n              car1: [ -11+12*2= -11+24=13, 0+24=24] -> 0 not in [13,24]\n              car2: [-47+24=-23, -36+24=-12] -> 0 not in [-23,-12]? \n              car3: [37+24=61,48+24=72] -> safe.\n          So freeway3 is safe at turn26.\n\nThen at turn26: we are at y3 (freeway3) and safe? Then at turn27: we must leave freeway3? Because at turn27 freeway3 is blocked.\n\nSo we can move to y4 at turn27? \n  Then at turn27: we are at freeway4 -> blocked? \n        Freeway4: same as freeway3 -> blocked at T=27 -> crash.\n\nSo we cannot be at freeway4 at turn27.\n\nWe can move to y2 at turn27? \n  At turn26: we are at y3 -> then at turn27: D -> to y2 (freeway2) -> freeway2 safe at turn27? yes.\n\nThen we have:\n\nturn24: U -> y1 (25)\nturn25: U -> y2 (26)\nturn26: U -> y3 (27) -> wait, no: at turn26 we do U -> so at turn26 we are at y3? \n        But at turn26: we are at freeway3 -> safe (as above) -> then at turn27 we do D -> so at turn27 we are at y2.\n\nThen we have:\n\nturn27: D -> y2 (so at turn27: freeway2 safe)\n\nThen we have to go up again: \n  turn28: U -> y3 (freeway3: safe at turn28? yes, because blocked only at 24 and 27)\n  turn29: U -> y4 (freeway4: safe at turn29)\n  ... same as before.\n\nBut now we did an extra D? So we have 9 U and 1 D -> 10 moves? But we also did an extra move? \n\nActually, the moves:\n\n1. turn24: U -> y1\n2. turn25: U -> y2\n3. turn26: U -> y3\n4. turn27: D -> y2\n5. turn28: U -> y3\n6. turn29: U -> y4\n7. turn30: U -> y5\n8. turn31: U -> y6\n9. turn32: U -> y7\n10. turn33: U -> y8\n11. turn34: U -> y9 -> 11 moves.\n\nThat's worse.\n\nWe could go up to y=5 by turn28? \n\nHow? \n  turn24: U -> y1 (25)\n  turn25: U -> y2 (26)\n  turn26: U -> y3 (27) -> crash? because at turn27 we are at freeway3 -> blocked? \n          But wait, at turn26 we are at freeway3 at turn26 -> safe? and then at turn27 we are still at freeway3? \n          Actually, after the move at turn26, we are at y3 at turn26. Then at turn27, we are still at y3? unless we move.\n\nBut we have to do an action at turn27. If we do S at turn27, then we stay at y3 -> and at turn27 freeway3 is blocked -> crash.\n\nIf we do U at turn27: then we go to y4 at turn27? \n      But at turn27 we are then on freeway4 -> blocked? freeway4 blocked at turn27 -> crash.\n\nSo we cannot be on freeway3,4,5 at turn27.\n\nTherefore, the first plan is the best: 10 moves with one stay.\n\nBut note: we have freeways 6,7,8 blocked at turns29 and 30. In the first plan we are at y=4 and y=5 at those turns -> safe.\n\nIs there a way to be at y=9 earlier? \n\nWe start at turn24. The minimal time to get to y=9 is 9 moves: turn24 to turn33. But we cannot because of the block at turn27.\n\nSo 10 moves is minimal.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: S\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\n\nBut let me double-check the freeways at the times we are on them:\n\nAt turn25: y=1 (freeway1) -> T=25: freeway1: car1: [ -24-36*(1)= -60, 11-36=-25] -> 0 not in [-60,-25] -> safe.\n\nAt turn26: y=2 (freeway2) -> same as freeway1: safe.\n\nAt turn27: we are at y=2 (freeway2) -> T=27: freeway2: [ -24-36*3 = -24-108=-132, 11-108=-97] -> safe.\n\nAt turn28: y=3 (freeway3) -> T=28: \n      car1: [ -11+12*4 = -11+48=37, 0+48=48] -> 0 not in [37,48]\n      car2: [-47+48=1, -36+48=12] -> 0 not in [1,12]\n      car3: [37+48=85,48+48=96] -> safe.\n\nAt turn29: y=4 (freeway4) -> same as freeway3 at T=29: \n      car1: [-11+12*5=49, 0+60=60] -> safe\n      car2: [-47+60=13, -36+60=24] -> safe\n      car3: [37+60=97,48+60=108] -> safe.\n\nAt turn30: y=5 (freeway5) -> same at T=30: safe.\n\nAt turn31: y=6 (freeway6) -> T=31: \n      car: [ -41+6*7= -41+42=1, -30+42=12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nAt turn32: y=7 (freeway7) -> same as freeway6 at T=32: k=8 -> [-41+48=7, -30+48=18] -> safe.\n\nAt turn33: y=8 (freeway8) -> T=33: \n      car1: [-41+6*9= -41+54=13, -30+54=24] -> safe\n      car2: [25+54=79,36+54=90] -> safe.\n\nThen at turn34: we are at y=9 -> no freeway.\n\nAll safe.\n\nSo the answer is the sequence above.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning from t=0 to t=H-1, so for t1=24, we write for turns 24 to 24+H-1.\n\nWe have H=10, so we write for turns 24 to 24+9 = 33.\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 24: U\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: S\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\n}\n\nBut wait, the player starts at (0,0) at turn24. The first action is at turn24.\n\nWe do:\n\nAt turn24: action U -> then at turn25: position (0,1) -> freeway1 -> safe.\n\nThen turn25: U -> turn26: (0,2) -> freeway2 -> safe.\n\nThen turn26: S -> turn27: (0,2) -> freeway2 -> safe.\n\nThen turn27: U -> turn28: (0,3) -> freeway3 -> safe (as computed for T=28).\n\netc.\n\nAll safe.\n\nSo this is correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 24\\) is 10. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\) by staying at \\(y = 2\\) during turn 27, when freeways 3, 4, and 5 are blocked, and progressing through higher freeways after the danger periods for freeways 6, 7, and 8 (turns 29 and 30) have passed.\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n- At turn 24, move up to \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1 is safe at turn 25).\n- At turn 25, move up to \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2 is safe at turn 26).\n- At turn 26, stay at \\(y = 2\\) to avoid being on freeway 3 at turn 27 (freeway 2 is safe at turn 27).\n- At turn 27, move up to \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3 is safe at turn 28).\n- At turn 28, move up to \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4 is safe at turn 29).\n- At turn 29, move up to \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5 is safe at turn 30).\n- At turn 30, move up to \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6 is safe at turn 31).\n- At turn 31, move up to \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7 is safe at turn 32).\n- At turn 32, move up to \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8 is safe at turn 33).\n- At turn 33, move up to \\(y = 9\\), reaching the goal.\n\nThis sequence ensures the player is not on any blocked freeway at the critical turns:\n- Freeways 3, 4, 5 are blocked at turn 27; the player is at \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2, safe).\n- Freeways 6, 7, 8 are blocked at turns 29 and 30; the player is at \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4, safe) at turn 29 and \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5, safe) at turn 30.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 24: U \\\\\nTurn 25: U \\\\\nTurn 26: S \\\\\nTurn 27: U \\\\\nTurn 28: U \\\\\nTurn 29: U \\\\\nTurn 30: U \\\\\nTurn 31: U \\\\\nTurn 32: U \\\\\nTurn 33: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 25, and the player is at (0,1). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to y=8).\n\nPlayer actions: U (up: y+1), D (down: y-1), S (stay: y same). The y-axis is from 0 to 9.\n\nCollision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y (which is between 1 and 8) and at that turn T, there is a car on that freeway such that the car's span at turn T includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player), then collision occurs.\n\nImportant note: when moving from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, the player is considered to be on y_T at turn T (so we check the car on freeway y_T at turn T) and then moves to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nGiven car states at turn t1=25:\n\nWe have freeways 1 to 8. Each car is given by (head, tail, direction, speed). Note the representation:\n\n- For left-moving (direction 'left'): the car moves left, so the head is at the right end? Actually, note the update:\n  - Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → at T: [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)]\n  - Right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → at T: [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note the initial span representation:\n\nFor freeway 1: only one car: (-60, -25, left, 36). \n  This is left-moving, so at turn t1=25, the car spans from -60 to -25? But wait, the update rule for left-moving: \n      Span(t1) = [h, τ] = [-60, -25] -> which is from -60 (left) to -25 (right)? But typically we think of head as the front.\n\nHowever, the update rule for left-moving: the entire car moves left by s per turn. So at time T, the span is [h - s*(T-t1), τ - s*(T-t1)].\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: [τ, h] at t1, then at T: [τ+s*(T-t1), h+s*(T-t1)].\n\nWe are interested in when the car spans include 0 (the player's x-coordinate) at the turn when the player is on that freeway.\n\nWe need to plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) starting from y=1 at turn 25, to reach y=9 in minimal turns, avoiding collisions.\n\nFirst, note that we start at y=1 at turn 25. The goal is to be at y=9.\n\nThe minimal number of moves without cars would be 8 moves (each U) to go from 1 to 9. But we have to avoid cars.\n\nWe must not be on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at a turn when there is a car on that freeway that covers 0 at that turn.\n\nLet me compute the positions of the cars at any turn T (relative to t1=25, so T = 25, 26, ...).\n\nDefine Δt = T - 25.\n\nSo for a car at freeway k:\n\nFor left-moving car (d='left'):\n  head_T = h - s * Δt\n  tail_T = τ - s * Δt\n  The span is [min(head_T, tail_T), max(head_T, tail_T)]? Actually, note the update: \n      [h - s*Δt, τ - s*Δt]\n  But in the initial representation for left: [h, τ] -> and since h and τ might be in any order? The example: (-60, -25) -> so h=-60, τ=-25. Then the span at T is:\n      [ -60 - 36*Δt, -25 - 36*Δt ]\n\nBut note: -60 - 36*Δt is less than -25 - 36*Δt, so the car is from ( -60 - 36*Δt ) to ( -25 - 36*Δt ). We need to check if 0 is in that interval.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt] -> and the example (12,1) for right: wait, the representation is (head, tail) or (τ, h)? \n\nThe table says for freeway 3: (12, 1, right, 12) -> so it's (head, tail) and direction? But the update rule for right uses [τ, h] -> so τ is the tail and h is the head? \n\nActually, the update rule for right says: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" and then becomes [τ + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. \n\nBut in the table, the car is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). So for a right-moving car, the head is the front (which is the right end) and tail is the back (left end). Therefore, the initial span at t1 for a right car is [tail, head]. \n\nBut in the table, the car is given as (head, tail, ...). So for the car (12, 1, right, 12): \n  head = 12, tail = 1 -> so the initial span is [tail, head] = [1,12]. Then at time T, the span is [1 + 12*Δt, 12 + 12*Δt].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: the car (-60, -25, left, 36): \n  head = -60, tail = -25 -> but for left-moving, the update rule uses [h, τ]? The rule says: \"Span(t1)=[h, τ]\" and then becomes [h - s*Δt, τ - s*Δt]. \n  However, note that in the left-moving case, the head is the front (which is the left end) and tail is the back? But here h=-60 and τ=-25, and since the car is moving left, the front (head) should be the leftmost? Actually, when moving left, the head is at the left. So the car spans from h (left) to τ (right)? But that would be [-60, -25] meaning from -60 to -25 (so -60 is left and -25 is right). Then when it moves left, both decrease. So the update is correct.\n\nBut note: the update rule for left uses [h, τ] and then subtracts s*Δt. The interval [h - s*Δt, τ - s*Δt] is the span at T.\n\nNow, we need to check for each freeway and each car, for which Δt the car covers 0.\n\nWe are going to compute for each freeway k (from 1 to 8) the set of Δt (nonnegative integers) for which there is a car on freeway k that has 0 in its span at turn T = 25 + Δt.\n\nFreeway 1: only one car: (-60, -25, left, 36)\n  Span at Δt: [ -60 - 36*Δt, -25 - 36*Δt ]\n  Condition: -60 - 36*Δt <= 0 <= -25 - 36*Δt\n  But note: as Δt increases, the entire interval moves left. Let's solve:\n    -60 - 36*Δt <= 0  => -36*Δt <= 60 => Δt >= -60/36 -> which is always true for Δt>=0? Actually, the interval is negative and becomes more negative. So 0 is never in the interval? Because the upper bound is -25 - 36*Δt which is negative for Δt>=0. So no collision on freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: (-60, -25, left, 36) -> same, no collision.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars:\n  Car1: (12, 1, right, 12) -> initial span [1,12] -> at Δt: [1+12*Δt, 12+12*Δt]\n  Condition: 1+12*Δt <= 0 <= 12+12*Δt -> \n      First: 1+12*Δt <= 0 -> 12*Δt <= -1 -> impossible for Δt>=0. So no.\n  Car2: (-24, -35, right, 12) -> note: head=-24, tail=-35 -> so initial span [tail, head] = [-35, -24] -> at Δt: [-35+12*Δt, -24+12*Δt]\n      Condition: -35+12*Δt <= 0 <= -24+12*Δt\n        Left: -35+12*Δt <= 0 -> 12*Δt <= 35 -> Δt <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916 -> so Δt=0,1,2\n        Right: 0 <= -24+12*Δt -> 24 <= 12*Δt -> Δt >= 2.\n        So Δt must be 2.\n        At Δt=2: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? Yes, at the right endpoint? But note: the interval is [-11,0] -> so 0 is included.\n        So at Δt=2, this car covers 0 on freeway 3.\n\n  Car3: (60,49,right,12) -> initial span [49,60] -> at Δt: [49+12*Δt,60+12*Δt] -> always positive? So 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 3: collision at Δt=2 (i.e., turn T=25+2=27).\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3? \n  The table says: | 4 | (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12), (60,49,right,12) |\n  So same as freeway 3: collision at Δt=2.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 3: collision at Δt=2.\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (-24, -35, right, 6)\n  head=-24, tail=-35 -> right-moving -> initial span [tail, head] = [-35, -24]\n  at Δt: [-35+6*Δt, -24+6*Δt]\n  Condition: -35+6*Δt <= 0 <= -24+6*Δt\n    Left: -35+6*Δt <=0 -> 6*Δt <=35 -> Δt <= 35/6 ≈5.83 -> Δt=0,1,...,5\n    Right: 0<=-24+6*Δt -> 6*Δt>=24 -> Δt>=4.\n    So Δt in {4,5}.\n    So collisions at Δt=4 (turn 29) and Δt=5 (turn 30).\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway 6: one car (-24,-35,right,6) -> collisions at Δt=4 and 5.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars:\n  Car1: (-24,-35,right,6) -> same as above: collisions at Δt=4 and 5.\n  Car2: (42,31,right,6) -> initial span [31,42] -> at Δt: [31+6*Δt,42+6*Δt] -> always positive -> no collision.\n\nSo freeway 8: collisions at Δt=4 and 5.\n\nSummary of collisions:\n\nFreeway 3,4,5: collision at Δt=2 (turn 27)\nFreeway 6,7,8: collisions at Δt=4 (turn 29) and Δt=5 (turn 30)\n\nWe start at turn 25 (Δt=0) at y=1.\n\nWe need to avoid:\n\n- At turn 27 (Δt=2): we must not be on freeways 3,4,5 at that turn.\n- At turn 29 (Δt=4): we must not be on freeways 6,7,8.\n- At turn 30 (Δt=5): we must not be on freeways 6,7,8.\n\nWe are going from y=1 to y=9. The minimal steps without obstacles is 8 steps (8 Ups). But we have obstacles at specific turns.\n\nWe need to plan a path that avoids being on the bad freeways at the bad times.\n\nWe can use U, D, S. Note that we can also move down to y=0 (which is safe, because cars are only on freeways 1-8) and then come back up.\n\nWe are at:\n  Turn 25: y=1.\n\nWe must avoid:\n\n  Turn 27: not on y=3,4,5 (because freeways 3,4,5 have collision at turn 27)\n  Turn 29: not on y=6,7,8\n  Turn 30: not on y=6,7,8\n\nBut note: we are at turn 25. We have turns 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, ...\n\nWe need to get to y=9.\n\nLet me denote the state (turn, y). The turn is t1 + Δt = 25 + Δt.\n\nWe can try to go up as fast as possible, but we have to avoid:\n\nAt turn 27 (Δt=2): we must not be at y=3,4,5.\n\nWhat are the possible positions at turn 27?\n\nAt turn 25: y=1.\n\nWe have two moves: from turn25 to turn26, then turn26 to turn27.\n\nLet me denote the actions at turn25 and turn26.\n\nWe can simulate:\n\nOption 1: go up both times.\n  Turn25: U -> y becomes 2 at turn26.\n  Turn26: U -> y becomes 3 at turn27.\n\nBut at turn27, we are at y=3 -> which is freeway3 -> collision! So not allowed.\n\nOption 2: first U, then S.\n  Turn25: U -> y=2 at turn26.\n  Turn26: S -> y=2 at turn27 -> which is freeway2 -> but freeway2 has no collision at any time? We saw freeway2 only had a left-moving car that never covers 0. So safe.\n\nThen at turn27: we are at y=2. Then we can continue.\n\nBut we also have to avoid the later collisions at turn29 and 30.\n\nOption 3: first S, then U.\n  Turn25: S -> y=1 at turn26.\n  Turn26: U -> y=2 at turn27 -> safe (freeway2, no collision).\n\nSame as above: at turn27 we are at y=2.\n\nOption 4: first U, then D -> but that would be y=1 at turn27 -> freeway1: safe.\n\nBut then we haven't made progress.\n\nWe want minimal turns, so we prefer to go up.\n\nSo at turn27, we can be at y=2 (if we did U then S, or S then U) or y=1 (if U then D) or even y=0 (if we did D at some point) but that might be slower.\n\nNow, from y=2 at turn27 (which is safe), we have to avoid:\n\n  turn29 (Δt=4) -> which is 2 turns after turn27: so at turn27 (Δt=2), then turn28 (Δt=3), turn29 (Δt=4).\n  Similarly, turn30 (Δt=5) is 3 turns after turn27.\n\nWe need to go from y=2 at turn27 to y=9, avoiding:\n\n  At turn29 (which is 2 turns from turn27): we must not be at y=6,7,8.\n  At turn30: we must not be at y=6,7,8.\n\nHow many moves to get from y=2 to y=9? 7 moves (if we do 7 Ups). But we have only 2 moves until turn29? \n\nAt turn27: we are at y=2.\n\nThen:\n  Turn27 (action): we can do U, D, S -> leads to y at turn28.\n  Turn28 (action): leads to y at turn29.\n\nSo at turn29, we can be at:\n  If we do two U: y=4 -> safe (since freeway4 is bad at turn29? wait, no: the bad freeways at turn29 are 6,7,8 -> so y=4 is safe).\n  Then at turn29, we are at y=4.\n\nBut we are not done: we need to get to y=9.\n\nBut we have to avoid turn30: we must not be at y=6,7,8 at turn30.\n\nAt turn29: we are at y=4.\n\nThen at turn29, we do an action -> leads to y at turn30.\n\nWe want at turn30 to not be at y=6,7,8. But from y=4, we can do:\n\n  U: y=5 -> safe (freeway5: but note freeway5 only had a collision at turn27, not at turn30? So safe).\n  D: y=3 -> safe.\n  S: y=4 -> safe.\n\nSo we are safe at turn30.\n\nBut we are only at y=5 (if we did U) at turn30. Then we need 4 more Ups to get to y=9.\n\nSo total turns from start:\n\n  Turn25: action? (we are at y=1)\n  Turn26: action? (we need to get to y=2 at turn27)\n  Turn27: at y=2 -> then we did two Ups to get to y=4 at turn29? Actually, from turn27 to turn29: two moves.\n\nBut let me write the sequence:\n\n  Option: \n    Turn25: U -> y=2 (turn26)\n    Turn26: S -> y=2 (turn27)  [safe at turn27]\n    Turn27: U -> y=3 (turn28)\n    Turn28: U -> y=4 (turn29)  [safe at turn29: y=4 not in {6,7,8}]\n    Turn29: U -> y=5 (turn30)  [safe at turn30: y=5 not in {6,7,8}]\n    Then we need to go from y=5 to y=9: 4 Ups: \n        Turn30: U -> y6 (turn31) -> but wait, at turn31, we are at freeway6: is there a collision? \n        We have to check freeway6 at turn31 (Δt=6). \n\nRecall freeway6: one car (-24,-35,right,6). At Δt=6: \n   span = [-35+6*6, -24+6*6] = [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12] -> which includes 0? No, 0 is not in [1,12]. So safe.\n\nBut then we continue:\n    Turn31: U -> y7 (turn32): freeway7 at turn32 (Δt=7): \n        freeway7 car: (-24,-35,right,6) -> at Δt=7: [-35+42, -24+42] = [7,18] -> 0 not included -> safe.\n    Turn32: U -> y8 (turn33): freeway8 at turn33 (Δt=8): \n        freeway8 has two cars:\n          car1: (-24,-35,right,6) -> at Δt=8: [-35+48, -24+48] = [13,24] -> safe.\n          car2: (42,31,right,6) -> [31+48,42+48] = [79,90] -> safe.\n    Turn33: U -> y9 (turn34) -> we are at y=9, which is the goal? Note the goal is (0,9) and freeways are from 1 to 8, so y=9 is safe.\n\nSo total turns: from turn25 to turn33: that's 9 turns? But wait, the actions are taken at turn25,26,...,33? and the last action (turn33) gets us to y9 at turn34? \n\nBut note: we are at (0,1) at turn25. Then:\n\n  After action at turn25, we are at y_{26} = y25 + Δy25.\n  We want y_{t1+H-1} = 9, meaning that after H-1 actions (starting from t1) we are at y=9.\n\nSo the sequence of actions: a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}. Then the player position at turn t1+H is y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nWe start at turn25: initial state is (0,1) at the beginning of turn25. Then we take action a25 -> then at turn26, we are at y26 = y25 + a25.\n\nWe want to have y_{25 + H} = 9? Actually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nBut note: the actions are applied at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. So:\n\n  At turn t1: we start at initial position (0, y_{t1}) -> then take a_{t1} -> then at turn t1+1, we are at y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{a_{t1}}.\n  ...\n  At turn t1+H-1: we take a_{t1+H-1} -> then at turn t1+H, we are at y_{t1+H} = ... but the problem says we require y_{t1+H-1} = 9? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". But note the indexing:\n\n  - At the beginning of turn t1, we are at (0, y_{t1}) = (0,1).\n  - Then we choose an action a_{t1} (for turn t1) -> then the player updates to y_{t1+1} at the next turn.\n\nSo the position at the beginning of turn t1+1 is y_{t1+1}.\n\nTherefore, the position at the beginning of turn t1+H is y_{t1+H}. But the problem says we want to reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nLet me re-read: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\nBut note: the action a_{t1} is taken at turn t1, and then the next state is at turn t1+1. So after k actions, we are at turn t1+k.\n\nWe want after H-1 actions? Then we are at turn t1 + (H-1). And we want the position at that turn to be 9? But the position at turn t is the position at the beginning of the turn? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at the turn after the last action? Or at the same turn?\n\nNote the update: after taking action at turn t, we get the position at turn t+1.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\n  turn t1: action a_{t1} -> then at turn t1+1: position y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δa_{t1}\n  ...\n  turn t1+k: action a_{t1+k} -> then at turn t1+k+1: position y_{t1+k+1} = y_{t1+k} + Δa_{t1+k}\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at the beginning of some turn? But the collision condition is checked at the turn when we are on the freeway, meaning at the beginning of the turn? Actually, the problem says:\n\n  \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\"\n\nAnd note: at turn T, we are at position (0, y_T) at the beginning of the turn? Then we take an action and move.\n\nSo we are concerned with the position at the beginning of the turn.\n\nTherefore, we want at the beginning of turn t1+H, we are at (0,9)? But the problem says \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me read carefully:\n\nThe problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd then: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nBut note: the actions are applied at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then the position at the beginning of turn t1+H is y_{t1+H} = ...? \n\nBut the problem says we want y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nSo let me see: \n\n  At the beginning of turn t1: y = 1.\n  Then we take action a_{t1} at turn t1 -> then at the beginning of turn t1+1: y_{t1+1} = 1 + Δa_{t1}.\n\n  Then we take action a_{t1+1} at turn t1+1 -> then at the beginning of turn t1+2: y_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} + Δa_{t1+1}.\n\n  ...\n\n  After H-1 actions: we have taken actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-2? \n\nBut the sequence is t=0 to H-1: so the actions are at t1+0, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. That's H actions.\n\nBut then the position after these H actions would be at turn t1+H: y_{t1+H} = ... \n\nBut the problem says we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9. \n\nThis implies that we are at y=9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, and then we take an action at that turn? But that action might change the position? \n\nThe problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\" meaning at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at y=9. Then we don't need to take an action at that turn? But the sequence of actions includes an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nLooking back: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nBut if we take an action at turn t1+H-1, then we move to y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Δa_{t1+H-1}. \n\nSo to have y_{t1+H-1}=9, we must not take an action that moves us away? Or we must take S? \n\nThe problem does not say that we stop when we reach (0,9). It says we must reach (0,9). And the minimal H such that after the sequence of H actions (from t1 to t1+H-1) we have y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nBut note: the action at turn t1+H-1 is taken at the beginning of that turn? Then we update to the next turn. But we require that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1 we are at 9? That would be before taking the action.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nI think there might be a misunderstanding. Let me reexamine the problem statement:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nAnd then the answer format lists actions for turn t1, t1+1, ... until the last action.\n\nAnd the goal is to have the player at (0,9) at the end of the sequence.\n\nBut note the update: the action a_t is taken at turn t, and then the position at turn t+1 is updated.\n\nSo if we take the last action at turn t1+H-1, then the next state is at turn t1+H. But we want the player to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H? \n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nThis suggests that at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are already at 9. Then we take an action at that turn? And then we move to y_{t1+H} which might not be 9.\n\nBut we want to be at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? Then we don't need to take an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut the sequence requires H actions? \n\nAlternatively, the minimal H might be the number of actions, and we are done when we are at 9 at the beginning of a turn. Then the last action we take is at turn t1+H-1, which should leave us at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H? \n\nBut then the condition is y_{t1+H}=9, not y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nI think there is a discrepancy.\n\nLooking at the problem: \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\". \n\nBut note the indexing: \n  - At the start of turn t1, we are at y_{t1}=1.\n  - After action a_{t1} (taken at turn t1), we are at y_{t1+1} = 1 + Δa_{t1}.\n  - Similarly, after action a_{t1+k} at turn t1+k, we are at y_{t1+k+1}.\n\nWe want y_{t1+H-1} = 9. This means that we are at 9 at the beginning of turn t1+H-1. How did we get there? \n\nThe action taken at turn t1+H-2 would have led to y_{t1+H-1}. Then at turn t1+H-1, we take an action a_{t1+H-1} (which is the last action) and then we go to y_{t1+H} = 9 + Δa_{t1+H-1}. \n\nBut we don't care about y_{t1+H} as long as we have y_{t1+H-1}=9? \n\nBut the goal is to be at (0,9). So if we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then we have reached the goal. Then why take an extra action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nThe problem says \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\", meaning that after the actions we are at (0,9). So if we are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, then we don't need to take an action at that turn? \n\nBut the sequence is defined for t=0 to H-1, so it includes H actions. \n\nThis suggests that the last action is taken at the turn when we are already at the goal? And then we might move away? \n\nThat doesn't make sense.\n\nI think there might be an off-by-one. \n\nLet me assume that we want to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H. Then we need H actions: at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1, and then at turn t1+H we are at y=9.\n\nThis is the usual interpretation.\n\nBut the problem explicitly says \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nPerhaps the indexing of the turns is such that the state y_t is defined at the end of turn t? \n\nBut the problem says: \"current turn is t1\" and \"initial position (0, y_{t1})\" -> so at the start of turn t1, we are at y_{t1}.\n\nThen when we take an action a_t at turn t, we update to y_{t+1} at the start of turn t+1.\n\nTherefore, we want y_{t1+H} = 9. This requires H actions (at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1) to reach from y_{t1} to y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBut the problem states: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nThis is a puzzle.\n\nAnother possibility: the minimal H is defined as the number of turns we use, and we are done when we are at 9 at the beginning of a turn. Then if we are at 9 at the beginning of turn T, then we used T - t1 turns? But the actions are taken at each turn from t1 to T-1, so the number of actions is T - t1.\n\nAnd the sequence is for the actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., T-1. Then the number of actions is H = T - t1.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence has H actions. \n\nAnd then it requires y_{t1+H-1}=9? \n\nIf H = T - t1, then t1+H-1 = T-1. So we want to be at 9 at the beginning of turn T-1? \n\nThat doesn't make sense.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nIt says \"minimal number of turns H\", not minimal number of actions. And then the sequence has H actions? \n\nBut then what is a \"turn\" in this context? \n\nThe problem also says: \"avoiding collisions with cars on freeways at each turn\".\n\nI think the intended meaning is: we start at turn t1, and we want to be at (0,9) at the beginning of some turn T, and we minimize the number of turns we go through, i.e., T - t1? \n\nBut then we would minimize the time steps, not the number of actions? \n\nAnd the number of actions is T - t1, because we take one action per turn from turn t1 to turn T-1.\n\nThen the sequence of actions is for turns t1 to T-1, and we want y_T = 9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nIf we let H = T - t1, then t1+H-1 = t1 + (T - t1) - 1 = T-1. So we want y_{T-1}=9? \n\nBut we want to be at 9 at turn T, not turn T-1.\n\nThis is very confusing.\n\nPerhaps the problem has a typo. In many such problems, we want to be at the goal at the turn after the last action.\n\nGiven the answer format and the fact that we are to list actions for turns starting at t1, I think the intended meaning is that we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1, and then at the beginning of turn t1+H, we are at y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nThen the number of actions is H, and the number of turns we simulate is H+1 (from turn t1 to turn t1+H) but the goal is at turn t1+H.\n\nThe problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", but then the sequence has H actions, which would cover H turns (from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1) and then the next turn is turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem also says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\" -> which is not matching.\n\nI found a similar problem in the history: in some problems, the state after the last action is the goal state.\n\nGiven the confusion, I will assume the standard interpretation: we want to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H, and we take actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1. Then the number of actions is H, and we call H the number of turns (which is a bit misleading) or perhaps they mean the number of actions as turns.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and then we list H actions.\n\n To resolve, I will look at the answer format: we list actions for turn t1, t1+1, ... until turn t1+H-1.\n\n And the condition is that after these actions, we are at (0,9).\n\n In terms of state: after action a_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1, we are at y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\n Therefore, we require y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\n The number of actions is H, and we minimize H.\n\n This is the typical setup.\n\n So in our case, we start at turn25: y25=1.\n We take actions at turn25, turn26, ..., turn25+H-1.\n Then at turn25+H, we are at y=9.\n\n And we minimize H.\n\n So the goal is to have y_{25+H} = 9.\n\n The number of actions is H.\n\n Now, back to our plan.\n\n We are at y25=1.\n\n We need to get to y_{25+H}=9.\n\n The minimal H is at least 8 (because 1+8=9).\n\n But we have to avoid collisions at the turns when we are on freeways 1-8.\n\n The collision is checked at the beginning of each turn for the freeway we are on at that turn.\n\n So at turn t, if we are at y_t in {1,2,...,8}, then we check the cars on freeway y_t at turn t.\n\n We start at turn25: y25=1 -> freeway1: safe (as we saw).\n\n We then take an action at turn25, which will determine y26.\n\n We need to avoid:\n\n   turn27: not on freeways 3,4,5 -> so not on y=3,4,5 at turn27.\n   turn29: not on freeways 6,7,8.\n   turn30: not on freeways 6,7,8.\n\n But note: turn27 is at Δt=2, which is turn25+2 = turn27.\n turn29 = turn25+4, turn30 = turn25+5.\n\n We want to minimize H.\n\n We considered a plan that takes 9 actions (H=9) to get to y34=9.\n\n But is there a faster plan?\n\n Minimal H=8: so we want y25+8 = y33=9.\n\n We need to go from y25=1 to y33=9 in 8 actions: net change of +8, so exactly 8 Ups.\n\n But we have to avoid the collision at turn27 (y27 must not be 3,4,5) and at turn29 and 30 (y29 and y30 not in {6,7,8}).\n\n Let's simulate the positions for 8 consecutive Ups:\n\n   turn25: y25=1\n   a25=U -> y26=2\n   a26=U -> y27=3 -> COLLISION (because freeway3 at turn27 has a car covering 0) -> not allowed.\n\n So we cannot do 8 Ups in a row.\n\n We must delay or avoid being at y=3,4,5 at turn27.\n\n How about we do not go up at turn25? \n\n Option: \n   a25=S -> y26=1\n   a26=U -> y27=2 -> safe (freeway2: no collision)\n   then we can continue with Ups.\n\n But now we are at y27=2.\n\n We need to get to y33=9: from 2 to 9 in 6 steps (actions at turn27 to turn32) -> 6 Ups would get us to 8, then we need one more to 9 -> but wait, 2+6=8, then one more to 9 -> total actions from turn25 to turn32: 8 actions? \n\n Let's count:\n\n   turn25: S -> y26=1\n   turn26: U -> y27=2\n   turn27: U -> y28=3\n   turn28: U -> y29=4\n   turn29: U -> y30=5\n   turn30: U -> y31=6\n   turn31: U -> y32=7\n   turn32: U -> y33=8 -> not 9.\n\n We need 7 Ups from turn27 to turn33? Then total actions would be 9.\n\n Alternatively, from y27=2, we do 7 Ups:\n\n   turn27: U -> y28=3\n   turn28: U -> y29=4\n   turn29: U -> y30=5\n   turn30: U -> y31=6\n   turn31: U -> y32=7\n   turn32: U -> y33=8\n   turn33: U -> y34=9 -> then H=9 actions.\n\n But we want to do it in 8 actions.\n\n How about we go up faster? We are at y27=2. We need to gain 7 in 6 actions? That means we need to do 7 Ups and maybe a down? But that would not help.\n\n Or can we avoid the later constraints?\n\n We have to avoid y=6,7,8 at turn29 and turn30.\n\n turn29: must not be at y=6,7,8 -> so we must be at y<=5 or y>=9 (but y>=9 only if we are at goal) at the beginning of turn29.\n turn30: same.\n\n In the above plan, at turn29 we are at y=4 -> safe, at turn30 we are at y=5 -> safe.\n\n But the problem is we only get to y33=8 with 8 actions.\n\n So we need at least 8+1=9 actions.\n\n Is there a way to gain an extra step? \n\n How about we do an extra Up somewhere? But we are already doing as many Ups as possible.\n\n Or we can go down to y=0 to avoid a collision and then come back, but that might add steps.\n\n Let me try to achieve y33=9.\n\n We need to have a net change of +8 in 8 actions.\n\n The actions are U (+1), D (-1), S (0). Let u be the number of U, d the number of D, s the number of S. Then u - d = 8, and u+d+s=8.\n\n This implies: u = 8 + d, and then 8+d + d + s = 8 -> 2d + s = 0 -> d=0, s=0, u=8.\n\n So the only way to achieve net +8 in 8 actions is to do exactly 8 Ups.\n\n But we cannot do 8 Ups in a row because then we would be at y=3 at turn27 -> collision.\n\n Therefore, it is impossible in 8 actions.\n\n So minimal H is 9.\n\n Now, we must find a sequence of 9 actions.\n\n We have two options from the start:\n\n  Option A: \n      a25 = U -> y26=2\n      a26 = S -> y27=2 (safe)\n      then we need to go from y27=2 to y34=9 in 7 actions: net +7. \n        u - d = 7, u+d+s=7 -> then 2u+s=7? Actually, u+d+s=7, u-d=7 -> add: 2u+s=14? -> then u>=7, but u-d=7 -> so u=7, d=0, s=0.\n        So we need exactly 7 Ups.\n\n      Then:\n        a27=U -> y28=3\n        a28=U -> y29=4\n        a29=U -> y30=5\n        a30=U -> y31=6\n        a31=U -> y32=7\n        a32=U -> y33=8\n        a33=U -> y34=9\n\n      But we must check collisions at each freeway we are on.\n\n      We already have:\n        turn27: y27=2 (freeway2) -> safe.\n\n      Now:\n        turn28: y28=3 (freeway3) -> we need to check freeway3 at turn28 (Δt=3).\n            freeway3 cars:\n                car1: (12,1,right,12): at Δt=3: [1+12*3,12+12*3]=[37,48] -> no.\n                car2: (-24,-35,right,12): at Δt=3: [-35+36, -24+36]=[1,12] -> includes 0? no, 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n                car3: (60,49,right,12): [49+36,60+36]=[85,96] -> safe.\n            So safe.\n\n        turn29: y29=4 (freeway4) -> at Δt=4:\n            freeway4 cars: same as freeway3 -> \n                car2: [-35+48, -24+48] = [13,24] -> safe.\n            others are safe.\n\n        turn30: y30=5 (freeway5) -> at Δt=5:\n            freeway5 cars: \n                car2: [-35+60, -24+60] = [25,36] -> safe.\n\n        turn31: y31=6 (freeway6) -> at Δt=6:\n            freeway6 car: (-24,-35,right,6) -> [ -35+6*6, -24+6*6] = [1,12] -> safe (0 not in [1,12]).\n\n        turn32: y32=7 (freeway7) -> at Δt=7:\n            freeway7 car: same -> [ -35+42, -24+42] = [7,18] -> safe.\n\n        turn33: y33=8 (freeway8) -> at Δt=8:\n            freeway8 cars: \n                car1: [-35+48, -24+48]=[13,24] -> safe.\n                car2: [31+48,42+48]=[79,90] -> safe.\n\n        turn34: y34=9 -> goal, safe.\n\n      So this works.\n\n  Option B: \n      a25 = S -> y26=1\n      a26 = U -> y27=2 (safe)\n      then same as above: 7 Ups from turn27 to turn33 -> y34=9.\n\n      This also works.\n\n  Option C: \n      a25 = U -> y26=2\n      a26 = D -> y27=1 (safe) \n      then we are at y27=1, and we need to get to y34=9: net +8 in 7 actions -> which would require u-d=8, u+d+s=7 -> then 2u+s=15 -> but u<=7 -> impossible.\n\n      So we need more actions.\n\n  Option D: \n      a25 = D -> y26=0 (safe, because freeways are 1-8, and y=0 is not a freeway) \n      then a26=U -> y27=1\n      a27=U -> y28=2\n      then we need to get to y34=9: from 2 to 9 in 6 actions: net +7 -> same as before, 7 actions? Actually, we have actions from turn25 to turn33: 9 actions, but we are at y27=1, then we need 8 more to 9? That would be 10 actions? Not minimal.\n\nSo the minimal H is 9, and we have two options: \n\n  Sequence 1:\n    Turn25: U\n    Turn26: S\n    Turn27: U\n    Turn28: U\n    Turn29: U\n    Turn30: U\n    Turn31: U\n    Turn32: U\n    Turn33: U\n\n  Then at turn34: y=9.\n\n  Sequence 2:\n    Turn25: S\n    Turn26: U\n    Turn27: U\n    Turn28: U\n    Turn29: U\n    Turn30: U\n    Turn31: U\n    Turn32: U\n    Turn33: U\n\n  Then at turn34: y=9.\n\nBut in sequence 2, at turn27 we do U and go to y=3 at turn28? \n\nWait, in sequence 2:\n\n  Turn25: S -> y26=1\n  Turn26: U -> y27=2\n  Turn27: U -> y28=3\n  ... same as sequence 1 from turn27.\n\nBut in sequence 1, we had:\n\n  Turn25: U -> y26=2\n  Turn26: S -> y27=2\n  Turn27: U -> y28=3\n\nIn sequence 2:\n\n  Turn25: S -> y26=1\n  Turn26: U -> y27=2\n  Turn27: U -> y28=3\n\nSo both end up with y28=3.\n\nBut in sequence 1, at turn27 we are at y=2, and then we go to y=3 at turn28.\n\nIn sequence 2, at turn27 we are at y=2, and then we go to y=3 at turn28.\n\nThey are the same from turn27 onwards.\n\nNow, which one is better? They have the same number of actions.\n\nBut we must check collisions at every turn.\n\nIn sequence 1:\n\n  turn25: y25=1 -> freeway1: safe.\n  turn26: y26=2 -> freeway2: safe.\n  turn27: y27=2 -> freeway2: safe.\n\nIn sequence 2:\n\n  turn25: y25=1 -> safe.\n  turn26: y26=1 -> freeway1: safe.\n  turn27: y27=2 -> freeway2: safe.\n\nBoth are safe.\n\nSo we can choose either.\n\nBut note: in sequence 1, at turn26 we are at y=2, and we do S. In sequence 2, at turn26 we are at y=1 and we do U.\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nWe can choose the first one.\n\nBut is there a reason to prefer one over the other? \n\nLet me check if there is a constraint at turn26? \n\nFreeway1 at turn26 (Δt=1): \n  freeway1: car (-60,-25,left,36) -> [ -60-36, -25-36] = [-96,-61] -> safe.\n\nFreeway2: same -> safe.\n\nSo both are safe.\n\nWe can choose:\n\n  Turn25: U\n  Turn26: S\n  Turn27: U\n  Turn28: U\n  Turn29: U\n  Turn30: U\n  Turn31: U\n  Turn32: U\n  Turn33: U\n\nBut wait, we have 9 actions: from turn25 to turn33. \n\nThen the player's position at turn34 is 9.\n\nWe need to write the sequence for turns 25 to 33.\n\nBut the answer format is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 25: a_{25}\nTurn 26: a_{26}\n...\n}\n\nSo for this sequence:\n\n  Turn25: U\n  Turn26: S\n  Turn27: U\n  Turn28: U\n  Turn29: U\n  Turn30: U\n  Turn31: U\n  Turn32: U\n  Turn33: U\n\nBut is there a way to do it in 9 actions that might be more optimal? We think 9 is minimal.\n\nWe must ensure that at turn28 (y28=3) is safe: freeway3 at turn28 (Δt=3) we already checked: safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn29: y29=4 -> freeway4 at Δt=4: \n  freeway4 car2: [-35+12*4, -24+12*4] = [-35+48, -24+48] = [13,24] -> safe.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 9, and one possible sequence is:\n\n  Turn25: U\n  Turn26: S\n  Turn27: U\n  Turn28: U\n  Turn29: U\n  Turn30: U\n  Turn31: U\n  Turn32: U\n  Turn33: U\n\nBut note: we have 9 actions, and we end at y34=9.\n\nBut the problem says to list the actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1, which is turn25 to turn33.\n\nSo we write:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: S\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\n}\n\nWe could also do the other sequence:\n\n  Turn25: S\n  Turn26: U\n  Turn27: U\n  ... same as above from turn27.\n\nBut then we have:\n\n  Turn25: S\n  Turn26: U\n  Turn27: U\n  ...\n\nWhich is also 9 actions.\n\nBut the first sequence has an 'S' at turn26, the second has a 'S' at turn25. \n\nBoth are minimal and valid.\n\nWe choose the first one arbitrarily.\n\nBut note: in the first sequence, we are at y=2 at turn26 and turn27, which is freeway2, and we know freeway2 is safe at all times.\n\nIn the second sequence, we are at y=1 at turn26, freeway1, which is also safe.\n\nSo either is fine.\n\nBut to be consistent, I'll output the first one.\n\nHowever, there is an alternative: what if we avoid the freeways 3,4,5 at turn27 by going down? \n\nFor example:\n\n  a25: U -> y26=2\n  a26: D -> y27=1 (safe)\n\nBut then we are at y27=1, and we need to go to 9 in 6 more actions (from turn27 to turn32) to get to y33=9? \n  Net change: from 1 to 9: +8 in 6 actions -> which requires u-d=8, u+d+s=6 -> 2u+s=14 -> u=7, s=0, d=-1 -> impossible.\n\nSo we cannot.\n\nTherefore, the above sequence is valid.\n\nBut note: in the sequence we have 9 actions, but we can also consider if we can reach earlier? \n\nWe ruled out 8 actions.\n\nWhat about 9 actions that might use a down move to avoid something? But we need net +8, so we must have 8 more Ups than Downs. In 9 actions, we can have 8 Ups and 1 Down and 0 S? Then net +7, which is not enough. Or 9 Ups and 1 Down? But we only have 9 actions. So we must have at least 8 Ups. The extra action can be a Down or a Stay. But if we do a Down, then we need an extra Up to compensate, so total Ups would be 9 and Downs 1: net +8, and that's 9 actions.\n\nFor example:\n\n  a25: U -> y26=2\n  a26: D -> y27=1\n  then we need 9 more Ups? But we only have 7 actions left? \n\n  Total actions: 9 -> so after a25 and a26, we have 7 actions to go from y27=1 to y34=?. We need to get to y34=9: net +8 from y27=1 -> so we need to gain 8 in 7 actions: \n      u - d = 8, u+d+s=7 -> 2u+s=15 -> u>=7.5 -> u=8, then d=0, s=-1 -> impossible.\n\nAlternatively, we do 8 Ups and 1 Down somewhere: net +7, which is not enough.\n\nSo we must have at least one Stay (or extra Ups with no downs) to get net +8 in 9 actions: as in the first solution.\n\nTherefore, the sequence we have is minimal.\n\nSo we output:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: S\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and we have H=9.\n\nAnd the sequence has 9 actions.\n\nWe are done.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 25\\) is 9. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) as follows:\n\n- At turn 25, the player is at \\(y = 1\\) (freeway 1). The car on freeway 1 at turn 25 has a span of \\([-60 - 36 \\times 0, -25 - 36 \\times 0] = [-60, -25]\\), which does not contain 0, so it is safe to move up to \\(y = 2\\).\n- At turn 26, the player is at \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2). The car on freeway 2 at turn 26 has a span of \\([-60 - 36 \\times 1, -25 - 36 \\times 1] = [-96, -61]\\), which does not contain 0. Staying at \\(y = 2\\) is safe and avoids being at \\(y = 3, 4,\\) or \\(5\\) at turn 27, where collisions would occur (freeways 3, 4, and 5 have cars covering 0 at turn 27).\n- At turn 27, the player is at \\(y = 2\\) (freeway 2), which is safe. Moving up to \\(y = 3\\) is safe because the cars on freeway 3 at turn 27 (for \\(\\Delta t = 2\\)) do not cover 0: the car \\((-24, -35, \\text{right}, 12)\\) has a span of \\([-35 + 12 \\times 2, -24 + 12 \\times 2] = [-11, 0]\\), which contains 0 only at the endpoint (considered a collision), but at \\(\\Delta t = 3\\) (turn 28), this car's span is \\([-35 + 12 \\times 3, -24 + 12 \\times 3] = [1, 12]\\), not containing 0.\n- From turns 28 to 33, moving up each turn progresses the player safely:\n  - Turn 28: \\(y = 3\\) (freeway 3) is safe (spans do not contain 0 at \\(\\Delta t = 3\\)).\n  - Turn 29: \\(y = 4\\) (freeway 4) is safe (spans do not contain 0 at \\(\\Delta t = 4\\)), and avoids \\(y = 6, 7, 8\\) at turn 29 (where collisions would occur).\n  - Turn 30: \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5) is safe (spans do not contain 0 at \\(\\Delta t = 5\\)), and avoids \\(y = 6, 7, 8\\) at turn 30.\n  - Turn 31: \\(y = 6\\) (freeway 6) is safe (car spans \\([ -35 + 6 \\times 6, -24 + 6 \\times 6] = [1, 12]\\), not containing 0).\n  - Turn 32: \\(y = 7\\) (freeway 7) is safe (car spans \\([ -35 + 6 \\times 7, -24 + 6 \\times 7] = [7, 18]\\), not containing 0).\n  - Turn 33: \\(y = 8\\) (freeway 8) is safe (cars: \\([ -35 + 6 \\times 8, -24 + 6 \\times 8] = [13, 24]\\) and \\([31 + 6 \\times 8, 42 + 6 \\times 8] = [79, 90]\\), not containing 0).\n- After the action at turn 33, the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at turn 34, which is the goal and not a freeway, so no collision check is needed.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal in 9 actions, and it is minimal because 8 actions (requiring 8 consecutive ups) would place the player at \\(y = 3\\) at turn 27, causing a collision with a car on freeway 3.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 25: U\nTurn 26: S\nTurn 27: U\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\n}",

We start at y=2 and need to reach y=9 (which is the top, note that y=0 is the bottom and y=9 is the top).\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The movement is:\n  U: y = y + 1\n  D: y = y - 1\n  S: y remains the same\n\nBut note: the player cannot go below 0 or above 9. So we are bounded.\n\nCollision: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y (which is between 1 and 8) and at that same turn, there is a car on that freeway that has a span that includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player is always 0) at turn T.\n\nImportant note: when you move from y_T to y_{T+1} at turn T, then at turn T you are still on y_T. So at turn T, you check the car on freeway y_T. Then at the next turn, you will be on y_{T+1} (if you moved) and then check the car on freeway y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nWe are given the car states at turn t1=26 for each freeway (1 to 8). We need to compute the car positions at future turns.\n\nCar update:\n  For a car given at turn t1 with (head, tail, direction, speed):\n    If direction is 'left', then at turn T (>=t1), the car's span is:\n        [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n    If direction is 'right', then:\n        [tau + s*(T-t1), head + s*(T-t1)]   [Note: in the table, for right-moving cars, the head is the rightmost? But the table lists (head, tail) and then says for right: [tau, head] becomes [tau+s*dt, head+s*dt]. So in the given, for a right car, head is the larger coordinate?]\n\nBut note: the table entry for freeway 3,4,5: \n  (24,13,right,12) -> so head=24, tail=13? But then the span at t1=26 is [13,24]? Actually, the problem says for right: \"Span(t1)= [tau, head]\" -> so [13,24] at t1=26.\n\nBut then at a future turn T, it becomes [13 + 12*(T-26), 24 + 12*(T-26)].\n\nSimilarly, left cars: at t1=26, (48,83,left,36) -> note: 48 and 83? But 48 < 83? Then the span is [48,83] at t1=26? Then for left, it becomes [48 - 36*(T-26), 83 - 36*(T-26)].\n\nBut note: the problem says for left: \"Span(t1) = [h, tau]\" and then becomes [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt]. So if h=48 and tau=83, then the car is from 48 to 83? That is a long car (36 units long) and moving left at 36 per turn? Then at T=26, it's [48,83]. At T=27: [48-36=12, 83-36=47]. At T=28: [12-36=-24, 47-36=11]. And so on.\n\nHowever, we are only concerned when the car's span covers 0? So we need to check at each turn T, for the freeway we are on, if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nBut note: each freeway has multiple cars? Yes, for example freeway 3 has three cars.\n\nSo we have to check all cars on the freeway we are on at turn T.\n\nOur plan: we are at turn 26 at y=2. We want to go to y=9. We can only move one step at a time. We must avoid being on a freeway y (1..8) at a turn T when 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nWe are allowed to stay at a freeway for multiple turns? But if we stay, then we check the same freeway every turn.\n\nWe can also move up or down to change freeways.\n\nWe need the minimal H (number of turns) and the sequence of actions.\n\nNote: the starting turn is t1=26, and we are at y=2. We are about to take an action at turn 26 to determine y_27? \n\nWait: the update rule: at turn t, we choose a_t, then we get y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t.\n\nSo at turn t1=26, we choose a_26, which will lead to y_27 = y_26 + Delta y_26.\n\nBut note: at turn 26, we are at y_26=2. Then we choose an action for turn 26. Then at turn 26, we are on freeway 2? And we must check if at turn 26, on freeway 2, there is a car that has 0 in its span? \n\nBut wait: the collision condition is: at turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T (which is between 1 and 8) and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nSo at the starting turn t1=26, we are at y=2 (which is freeway 2). We must check if at turn 26, on freeway 2, there is a car that covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, after we take an action at turn 26, we get y_27, and then at turn 27 we will be on freeway y_27 (if we moved) and we check the cars at turn 27 on that freeway.\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\". So at turn T, you are on y_T. \n\nSo the starting state: at turn 26, we are at y=2. So we must check freeway 2 at turn 26.\n\nFreeway 2: \n  Cars: (48,83,left,36) -> one car? \n  Span at turn 26: [48,83] (since left: [h, tau] = [48,83]). \n  Does 0 fall in [48,83]? No, because 48>0.\n\nSo we are safe at turn 26 on freeway 2.\n\nNow we can choose an action at turn 26: U, D, or S.\n\nWe want to get to y=9. The minimal number of moves without cars would be 7 moves (since 2 to 9: 7 steps up). But we have to avoid collisions.\n\nWe must compute the positions of the cars for each freeway at each future turn.\n\nWe'll let dt = T - 26. So at turn T = 26 + dt, the car positions are:\n\nFreeway 1: one car (left): \n  Span(T) = [48 - 36*dt, 83 - 36*dt]\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: [48 - 36*dt, 83 - 36*dt]\n\nFreeway 3,4,5: each has three cars (all right-moving, speed 12):\n  Car1: (24,13,right,12) -> [13 + 12*dt, 24 + 12*dt]\n  Car2: (-12,-23,right,12) -> [-23 + 12*dt, -12 + 12*dt]\n  Car3: (-48,-59,right,12) -> [-59 + 12*dt, -48 + 12*dt]\n\nFreeway 6,7: one car (right, speed 6):\n  (-18,-29,right,6) -> [-29 + 6*dt, -18 + 6*dt]\n\nFreeway 8: two cars:\n  First: (-18,-29,right,6) -> same as above: [-29 + 6*dt, -18 + 6*dt]\n  Second: (48,37,right,6) -> [37 + 6*dt, 48 + 6*dt]   [Note: the table says (48,37,right,6) -> so head=48, tail=37? Then for right: span at t1 is [37,48] and then [37+6*dt,48+6*dt]\n\nWe need to check for each freeway and each turn T (>=26) whether 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nWe are going to simulate the path from y=2 at turn26 to y=9 at some turn T. We want the minimal T-26 (so minimal H = number of actions? Note: we take H actions from turn26 to turn26+H-1, and then at turn26+H we are at y=9? But note: we take actions at turn26, turn27, ... turn26+H-1, and then at turn26+H we have the position. But we require that at turn26+H-1 we are at (0,9). Actually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then at the end we have y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nSo we take H actions: at turns t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. Then at turn t1+H, we are at the new position? But the problem says: the sequence of actions is taken for t from 0 to H-1, meaning at turn t1+0, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. Then after H actions, the turn is t1+H, but we don't take an action at turn t1+H? And the position at turn t1+H is the result of the last action.\n\nBut the goal is to have y_{t1+H-1} = 9? Actually, the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nWait: the sequence of actions is from t=0 to t=H-1, so the last action is at turn t1+H-1. Then the position after that action is y_{t1+H}? But the problem states: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\", so after the action at turn t, we get the next position at turn t+1.\n\nBut the goal is: at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). That is, the position at turn t1+H-1 is (0,9). \n\nThis is confusing. Let me read: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1\". But note that we start at turn t1 at (0,2). Then we take an action at turn t1 to get to y_{t1+1}. But the problem says: \"the current turn is t1\", and we are at (0, y_{t1}) = (0,2). Then we take actions at t1, t1+1, ... until we are at (0,9) at some turn. The minimal H such that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nBut when? After H-1 moves? \n\nLet me define:\n  Turn t1: position = (0,2)  [we are about to take action a_{t1}]\n  After action a_{t1} at turn t1: we get position at turn t1+1.\n\nWe want to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nThat would imply that we take H-1 actions? \n\nBut the sequence is {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} -> that's H actions: t=0 to t=H-1, so actions at t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1.\n\nThen the position at turn t1+H is the result of the last action? And we are not at turn t1+H? \n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nSo at turn t1+H-1, we are at position (0,9). \n\nBut note: at turn t1, we are at (0,2). Then we take an action at turn t1 to move to y_{t1+1}. Then at turn t1+1, we are at that new y. \n\nWe require that at turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nThat means we take actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-2 to get to y=9 at turn t1+H-1. \n\nBut then the sequence of actions is for turns: t1 to t1+H-1? That would be H actions, but the last action at t1+H-1 would then determine the position at turn t1+H? \n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nLooking back: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nBut the action at time t1+t is taken at turn t1+t, and then the position at turn t1+t+1 is updated.\n\nSo the position at the end of the sequence (after the last action) is at turn t1+H (because the last action is at t1+H-1, and then we get y_{t1+H}).\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nThis suggests that we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. That means that we are already at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? Then we don't take an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut the sequence includes actions from t1 to t1+H-1. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that after H actions, we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H. But then the goal would be y_{t1+H} = 9, not y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nBut the problem states: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nI think there is a confusion. Let me re-read the problem statement:\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nand then in the answer format, we list actions for turn t1, t1+1, ... until the last action.\n\nBut the position at turn t1+H-1 must be 9? \n\nConsider: \n  At turn t1: we are at y2 (given). \n  Then we take action at turn t1: a_{t1} -> then at turn t1+1, we are at y3 = y2 + Delta.\n  Then we take action at turn t1+1: a_{t1+1} -> then at turn t1+2, we are at y4.\n\nWe want to be at y=9 at some turn. The turn index when we are at y=9 is the turn at which we have arrived.\n\nBut the problem says: at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\nThat would mean that we are at (0,9) at the start of turn t1+H-1? Then we take an action at turn t1+H-1? But the goal is to reach (0,9), so we don't need to take an action after that? \n\nBut the sequence includes the action at turn t1+H-1? Then after that action we would move? \n\nThis is ambiguous.\n\nLooking at the example in the problem: \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and then \"Turn t_1+1: ...\" until the last action.\n\nBut if we are at y=9 at turn t1+H-1, then we don't need to take an action at that turn? Or do we? \n\nNote: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". And the sequence is H actions? \n\nAlternatively, H is the number of actions taken. We start at turn t1 at y=2. We take H actions and then we are at y=9. The last action is taken at turn t1+H-1, and then at turn t1+H we are at y=9. But the problem says the goal is at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nI think there is a mistake. Let me check the problem again:\n\n\"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\"\n\nBut in the update rule, the position at turn t1+H-1 is determined by the action at turn t1+H-2? \n\nActually, the update is: \n  y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t   [action at turn t]\n\nSo:\n  y_{t1} = 2 (given)\n  Then we choose a_{t1}: this gives y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Delta\n  Then a_{t1+1} gives y_{t1+2} = y_{t1+1} + Delta\n  ...\n  After H actions, we have taken actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1, and we have:\n      y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Delta_{t1+H-1}\n\nBut the goal is to have y_{t1+H-1} = 9? \n\nThat would mean that at the beginning of the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we are at y=9. Then we take an action at turn t1+H-1? But then we might move away? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we are at (0,9) after the last action, which is at turn t1+H-1, and then the next state is at turn t1+H, but we don't care as long as at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9? \n\nBut note: the collision condition is checked at every turn T when we are on a freeway. So at turn t1+H-1, if we are at y=9, then we are not on any freeway (because freeways are 1..8, and 9 is the top). So we don't check collision at y=9. \n\nBut the problem says \"reach (0,9)\", so we are done when we are at (0,9). \n\nSo if we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1, then we don't need to take an action at that turn? But the sequence includes actions from t1 to t1+H-1, so if we are at 9 at turn t1+H-1, then we don't take an action at turn t1+H-1? \n\nBut the sequence is defined for t=0 to H-1, so that includes H actions. \n\nI think there is a misunderstanding. Let me try to clarify with an example without cars:\n\nStart at y=2 at turn26. We want to get to y=9. Without cars, we can do:\n\n  Turn26: U -> y27=3\n  Turn27: U -> y28=4\n  ...\n  Turn33: U -> y34=9\n\nThen we are at y=9 at turn34. How many actions? From turn26 to turn33: 8 actions? Then H=8? But then the position at turn26+8-1 = turn33 is 9? Yes. \n\nSo the sequence has 8 actions: from turn26 to turn33. And at turn33, we are at y=9.\n\nTherefore, we take an action at turn33 (U) to go from y8 to y9? Then at turn34 we are at y9? But the problem says at turn t1+H-1 = 26+8-1 = 33, we are at y=9? \n\nBut at turn33, we are at y8 (if we took 7 actions: from turn26 to turn32, then we would be at y9 at turn33? \n\nLet me count:\n\n  Turn26: start at y2 -> take U -> turn27: y3\n  Turn27: at y3 -> take U -> turn28: y4\n  ...\n  Turn32: at y8 -> take U -> turn33: y9\n\nSo at turn33, we are at y9. But the action that got us to y9 was taken at turn32. Then at turn33, we are at y9. Then the last action in the sequence is at turn32? \n\nBut the sequence would be from turn26 to turn32: that's 7 actions? Then H=7. Then the position at turn26+7-1 = turn32 is y8? But we want to be at y9 at turn32? \n\nNo, we are at y9 at turn33. \n\nSo to be at y9 at turn t1+H-1, we need to be at y9 at turn26+H-1.\n\nIn the example, if we want to be at y9 at turn26+H-1, then we set 26+H-1 = 33? -> H-1=7 -> H=8. Then the sequence has 8 actions: from turn26 to turn33? But then at turn33, we take an action? But we are already at y9? \n\nThat doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that we are at y9 at the turn after the last action. \n\nI think the problem has a typo. Looking at the update: \n  \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t\"\n\nSo the position at turn t+1 is determined by the action at turn t.\n\nWe start at turn t1: y_{t1} = 2.\n\nWe want to be at y_{t} = 9 for some t. \n\nThe minimal H is the number of actions taken until we first reach y=9. \n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nLet me assume that the problem means: \n  We take H actions (from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1) and then the position at turn t1+H is 9? \nBut then the condition is y_{t1+H}=9, not y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nBut the problem states y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nAnother possibility: the turn index when we are at y=9 is t1+H-1. That means we have taken H-1 actions? Then the sequence would have H-1 actions? But the problem says the sequence has H actions.\n\nI think the only logical interpretation is:\n\n  We are at turn t1 at y2.\n  We take an action at turn t1: this gives y_{t1+1}\n  ...\n  We take an action at turn t1+H-1: this gives y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nBut then the position at turn t1+H is 9. The sequence has H actions: from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nThen the minimal H such that we can get to y9 in H actions.\n\nAnd then the condition for the goal is y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nBut the problem states: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\nHowever, in the answer format, we list actions for turn t1, t1+1, ... t1+H-1.\n\nAnd then at turn t1+H, we are at y9.\n\nBut then we are not at y9 at turn t1+H-1? \n\nTo resolve, I will look at the collision note: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} != y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\".\n\nThis suggests that at turn T, you are on y_T. \n\nSo at the turn when we are at y=9, we are on the goal and not on any freeway. \n\nWe want to be on y=9 at some turn. The turn when we are at y=9 is the turn after the last action that moved us to y9.\n\nFor example, if we are at y8 at turn T, and we take U at turn T, then at turn T+1 we are at y9. Then at turn T+1, we are on y9 and safe.\n\nBut the problem requires the sequence of actions until we reach y9. The last action is the one that moves us to y9.\n\nSo the sequence includes that last action.\n\nTherefore, the condition should be: after the last action (at turn t1+H-1), we are at y9 at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nThis is a contradiction.\n\nGiven the confusion, I will assume that the problem means we are to be at (0,9) at the turn after the last action, i.e., at turn t1+H. But then the problem should say y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nHowever, the problem explicitly says y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nAnother possibility: the actions are taken and then we are at the position at the same turn? That doesn't fit the update rule.\n\nI think there might be a indexing issue. Let me redefine the turns:\n\n  Turn t1: we are at y_{t1} = 2.\n  We take action a_{t1} -> this immediately updates the position to y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Delta, but that new position is effective at turn t1+1.\n\n  So at turn t1, we are at y2, and we take an action, but during turn t1, we are still at y2. The move happens at the end of turn t1, so at the start of turn t1+1, we are at the new position.\n\n  Collision check at turn t1: we are at y2, so we check freeway2 at turn t1.\n\n  Then at turn t1+1, we are at the new y, and we check that freeway at turn t1+1.\n\nSo the goal is to have at the start of turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9? But then we haven't taken the action at turn t1+H-1 yet. But the sequence includes actions from turn t1 to turn t1+H-1.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nGiven the time, I will assume that the problem means:\n\n  We take actions at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n  The position at turn t1 is given as 2.\n  After action at turn t1, we have y_{t1+1} = 2 + Delta.\n  ...\n  After action at turn t1+H-1, we have y_{t1+H} = y_{t1+H-1} + Delta_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nSo we require y_{t1+H} = 9.\n\nThen the minimal H such that we can achieve that.\n\nAnd the condition for the goal is y_{t1+H}=9.\n\nThis matches the update rule and the sequence of actions.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\n However, in the answer format, we are to list actions for turn t1 to turn t1+H-1, which is H actions, and then after the last action we are at y9 at turn t1+H.\n\n And the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", but then in the condition it says y_{t1+H-1}=9, which is not consistent.\n\nGiven the urgency, and that the problem might have a typo, I will proceed with the logical interpretation: we must arrive at y9 at turn t1+H, after H actions taken at turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAnd then at turn t1+H, we are at y9 and not on any freeway (so no collision check needed for freeway).\n\nBut note: during the journey, we might be on freeways 1..8 and must avoid collision at every turn from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nBecause at turn T (>=t1 and < t1+H), we are on freeway y_T (which is between 1 and 8) and must avoid having 0 in any car's span on that freeway at turn T.\n\nAt turn t1+H, we are at y=9, so no freeway, no collision check.\n\nSo our goal: minimize H, and then the actions.\n\nWe start at y2 at turn26.\n\nWe must go to y9, so we need at least 7 ups.\n\nBut we can also move down or stay to avoid cars.\n\nWe will simulate the future car positions and find a path.\n\nLet me compute for each freeway the times when 0 is in the span of any car. We call this an unsafe time for that freeway.\n\nFreeway 1 and 2: one car (left, speed 36)\n  Span at time T: [48 - 36*(T-26), 83 - 36*(T-26)]\n  0 in [48-36*dt, 83-36*dt]  (dt = T-26)\n  => 48 - 36*dt <= 0 <= 83 - 36*dt\n  => 48 <= 36*dt <= 83\n  => dt in [48/36, 83/36] = [4/3, 83/36] ~ [1.333, 2.305]\n  So for dt = 2?

(because freeway1 is unsafe at T=28)\n        S: stay at y2 -> unsafe at T=28.\n\n    So at T=27, we must go up.\n\n        T=27: U -> y28=3\n\n    Then at T=28: at y3, and T=28: freeway3 is safe (as per summary).\n\n    Now at T=28: we are at y3. \n        We can go U to y4 at T=29.\n            T=29: freeway4: unsafe? because freeways 3,4,5 are not unsafe at T=29? \n            But our summary: at T=29, unsafe freeways are 6,7,8 -> so freeway4 is safe.\n        So we can go U: to y4 at T=29.\n\n    T=28: U -> y29=4\n\n    Then at T=29: at y4, safe (since freeway4 is safe at T=29).\n\n    Now at T=29: \n        We can go U to y5 at T=30.\n            T=30: freeway5: unsafe! (because freeway5 is unsafe at T=30)\n        Or stay at y4: then at T=30, we are at y4 -> freeway4 at T=30 is unsafe.\n        Or go down to y3: then at T=30, we are at y3 -> freeway3 at T=30 is unsafe.\n\n    So we cannot be at y3,4,5 at T=30.\n\n    Alternatively, we can try to go up to y5 at T=30? but unsafe.\n\n    Or at T=29, we can go up twice? but we can only do one action per turn.\n\n    Or we can go to a freeway that is safe at T=30? Only freeways 1 and 2 are safe at T=30.\n\n    So we need to get to y1 or y2 by T=30.\n\n    From y4 at T=29, we can go down:\n        D: to y3 at T=30 -> unsafe (freeway3 unsafe)\n        Or two downs? but we only have one action at T=29.\n\n    So we cannot avoid being at y3,4,5,6,7,8 at T=30? \n\n    But wait, we are at y4 at T=29. We need to be at y1 or y2 at T=30.\n\n    How? We need to go down twice? But we have only one move at T=29.\n\n    So we cannot get to y1 or y2 in one move from y4.\n\n    Therefore, this path fails at T=30.\n\n  So the stay option at T=26 leads to a dead end.\n\nNow try down at T=26:\n\n  T=26: D -> y27=1 (freeway1 at T=27: safe, as above)\n\n  Then at T=27: at y1, safe.\n\n  Now at T=27: \n        We can go U: to y2 at T=28 -> but freeway2 at T=28 is unsafe.\n        Stay: at y1 at T=28 -> freeway1 at T=28: unsafe.\n        Down: to y0 at T=28. \n            y0 is not a freeway? freeways are 1..8, so y0 is safe (no collision check).\n\n  So go down: D -> y28=0.\n\n  At T=28: at y0, safe.\n\n  Then at T=28: \n        We can only go up (since we cannot go below 0) -> to y1 at T=29.\n        Or stay? but then we are at y0.\n\n        If we go up: to y1 at T=29.\n            Freeway1 at T=29: safe (because freeway1 is unsafe only at T=28, and at T=29 we computed safe: [48-108=-60,83-108=-25] -> doesn't cover 0).\n\n        So go U: y29=1.\n\n  At T=29: at y1, safe.\n\n  Then at T=29: \n        We can go U to y2 at T=30.\n            Freeway2 at T=30: safe? \n                T=30: freeway2: [48-36*4=48-144=-96,83-144=-61] -> safe.\n        So U: y30=2.\n\n  At T=30: at y2, safe.\n\n  Then we need to go to y9: we are at y2 at T=30. We need 7 moves up. But we can start going up.\n\n  However, we must check the future unsafe turns. We know that for T>=31, all freeways are safe.\n\n  So from T=30: we can go up every move.\n\n    T=30: U -> y31=3 (freeway3 at T=31: safe)\n    T=31: U -> y32=4\n    T=32: U -> y33=5\n    T=33: U -> y34=6\n    T=34: U -> y35=7\n    T=35: U -> y36=8\n    T=36: U -> y37=9\n\n  So we reach y9 at T=37.\n\n  Total actions: from T=26 to T=36: 11 actions.\n\n  But is there a shorter path?\n\n  We spent a few moves going down and then up. Let me count the moves:\n\n    T=26: D (1)\n    T=27: D (2)\n    T=28: U (3)  [from y0 to y1]\n    T=29: U (4)  [from y1 to y2]\n    T=30: U (5)  [from y2 to y3]\n    T=31: U (6)  [y3->4]\n    T=32: U (7)  [4->5]\n    T=33: U (8)  [5->6]\n    T=34: U (9)  [6->7]\n    T=35: U (10) [7->8]\n    T=36: U (11) [8->9]\n\n  So 11 actions.\n\nBut we might do better.\n\nAt T=26, we did D, then D at T=27, then U at T=28, then U at T=29, then U at T=30 to y3, then 6 more to y9: total 11.\n\nAlternatively, after reaching y1 at T=29, we could go more than one up? But we can only do one per turn.\n\nIs there a way to avoid going to y0 and then back?\n\nLet me try a different move at T=27:\n\n  At T=26: D -> y27=1 (safe)\n\n  At T=27: we cannot go to y2 at T=28 (unsafe) or stay at y1 (unsafe). So we must go to y0.\n\n  So we have to go down.\n\nThen at T=28: we are at y0. We can only go up. So we go to y1 at T=29.\n\nThen we can go to y2 at T=30.\n\nSo this seems fixed.\n\nBut wait, at T=29, we are at y1. Can we go to y2 at T=30? yes, and it is safe.\n\nThen from y2 at T=30, we go up to y3 at T=31, etc.\n\nBut is there a shortcut? \n\nNotice that at T=31, all are safe. So if we can be at a higher y at T=30, then we might save moves.\n\nBut at T=30, the only safe freeways are y1 and y2.\n\nSo we cannot be above y2 at T=30.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of moves is 11.\n\nBut let me see if we can start with a different move.\n\nWhat if at T=26 we stay? we tried and got stuck at T=29.\n\nWhat if at T=26 we stay, then at T=27 we don't go up? \n\n  T=26: S -> y27=2 (safe)\n  T=27: we must avoid being at y2 at T=28 (unsafe). \n        So we can go down to y1 at T=28? \n            But freeway1 at T=28 is unsafe -> cannot.\n        Or go up to y3 at T=28? \n            freeway3 at T=28 is safe -> allowed.\n\n  So we go up: y28=3.\n\n  Then at T=28: at y3, safe.\n\n  Then at T=28: \n        We can go up to y4 at T=29 -> safe (freeway4 safe at T=29) -> y29=4.\n        Or go down to y2? but then at T=29, y2: freeway2 at T=29: safe? yes (freeway2 safe at T=29: [48-36*3=48-108=-60,83-108=-25] -> safe). \n        Or stay: y3 at T=29 -> freeway3 at T=29: safe? (freeway3 not unsafe at T=29) -> yes.\n\n  But we know at T=30, freeway3,4,5 are unsafe. So we must not be at y3,4,5 at T=30.\n\n  So at T=29, we need to get to y1 or y2.\n\n  From y4 (if we went up at T=28) -> then at T=29, we are at y4. \n        To get to y1 or y2 at T=30, we need to go down 2 or 3 steps? but only one move: \n          down: to y3 at T=30 -> unsafe.\n          or down twice? not possible.\n\n  So if we went to y4 at T=28, we are stuck.\n\n  Alternatively, at T=28: we are at y3. \n        We can go down to y2 at T=29 -> safe (freeway2 safe at T=29).\n        Then at T=29: at y2, safe.\n\n        Then at T=29: \n            We can go down to y1 at T=30 -> safe (freeway1 safe at T=30).\n            Or stay: to y2 at T=30 -> safe (freeway2 safe).\n            Or up: to y3 at T=30 -> unsafe.\n\n        So we can do: down to y1 or stay at y2.\n\n        Let's go down: T=29: D -> y30=1 (safe).\n\n        Then at T=30: at y1, safe.\n\n        Then we need to go up to y9: 8 moves: \n            T=30: U -> y31=2\n            T=31: U -> y32=3\n            ... \n            T=37: U -> y38=9\n\n        Total actions: \n            T=26: S (1)\n            T=27: U (2)\n            T=28: D (3)  [from y3 to y2? actually: at T=28 we are at y3, then D: y29=2]\n            T=29: D (4)  [y29=2 -> y30=1]\n            T=30: U (5)  [y30=1->y31=2]\n            T=31: U (6)  [2->3]\n            T=32: U (7)  [3->4]\n            T=33: U (8)  [4->5]\n            T=34: U (9)  [5->6]\n            T=35: U (10) [6->7]\n            T=36: U (11) [7->8]\n            T=37: U (12) [8->9]\n\n        So 12 actions, which is worse than 11.\n\n  Alternatively, at T=29: stay at y2 (if we went down to y2 at T=28? but we are at y3 at T=28, then down to y2 at T=29).\n\n        Then at T=29: stay -> y30=2, which is safe.\n\n        Then from T=30: at y2, we can start going up:\n\n            T=30: U -> y31=3\n            T=31: U -> y32=4\n            ... \n            T=36: U -> y37=8\n            T=37: U -> y38=9\n\n        Actions: \n            T=26: S (1)\n            T=27: U (2)\n            T=28: D (3) [y28=3 -> y29=2]\n            T=29: S (4) [stay at y2]\n            T=30: U (5) [y30=2->y31=3]\n            ... until T=37: U (12th action) -> 12 actions.\n\n  Or at T=29: we go down to y1: then we do:\n\n        T=29: D -> y30=1\n        T=30: U -> y31=2\n        T=31: U -> y32=3\n        ... \n        T=37: U -> y38=9\n\n        Still 12 actions.\n\nSo the down path at T=26 gives 11 actions.\n\nWhat if at T=26 we go down, and then at T=27 we go down to y0, then at T=28 we go up to y1, then at T=29 we go up to y2, then at T=30 we go up to y3, and then we continue.\n\nBut then we have:\n\n  T=26: D (1) -> y27=1\n  T=27: D (2) -> y28=0\n  T=28: U (3) -> y29=1\n  T=29: U (4) -> y30=2\n  T=30: U (5) -> y31=3\n  T=31: U (6) -> y32=4\n  T=32: U (7) -> y33=5\n  T=33: U (8) -> y34=6\n  T=34: U (9) -> y35=7\n  T=35: U (10) -> y36=8\n  T=36: U (11) -> y37=9\n\nSo 11 actions.\n\nBut note: at T=30, we are at y2, then we go to y3 at T=31. But at T=30, we are at y2 (safe) and then we take U to go to y3 at T=31. At T=31, freeway3 is safe.\n\nSo that works.\n\nIs there a way to do it in 10 or less? \n\nThe minimal without obstacles is 7. But we have to detour. We spent 4 moves (D,D,U,U) to go from y2 to y2 (at T=30) and then 7 moves to go to y9, but that's 11. \n\nNotice that after T=30, we are safe to go up. But we are at y2 at T=30. We need 7 ups to get to y9. So the earliest we can be at y9 is T=30+7 = 37, and we take 7 actions from T=30 to T=36, and then we are at y9 at T=37.\n\nPlus the moves to get to y2 at T=30: we started at T=26 at y2, and then we did 4 moves (D,D,U,U) to be at y2 at T=30. So total 4+7=11.\n\nIf we can get to a higher y by T=30, but we cannot because the safe freeways at T=30 are only y1 and y2.\n\nSo 11 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the sequence:\n\n  Turn 26: D\n  Turn 27: D\n  Turn 28: U\n  Turn 29: U\n  Turn 30: U\n  Turn 31: U\n  Turn 32: U\n  Turn 33: U\n  Turn 34: U\n  Turn 35: U\n  Turn 36: U\n\nBut wait, after Turn36: we are at y37=9? \n\nLet me trace:\n\n  T=26: start y=2, do D -> y27=1\n  T=27: at y1, do D -> y28=0\n  T=28: at y0, do U -> y29=1\n  T=29: at y1, do U -> y30=2\n  T=30: at y2, do U -> y31=3\n  T=31: at y3, do U -> y32=4\n  T=32: at y4, do U -> y33=5\n  T=33: at y5, do U -> y34=6\n  T=34: at y6, do U -> y35=7\n  T=35: at y7, do U -> y36=8\n  T=36: at y8, do U -> y37=9\n\nSo at T=37, we are at y9. But the last action is at T=36. Then the sequence has 11 actions? \n\nBut we require that at turn t1+H-1 = 26+H-1, we are at y=9. \n\nIf we are at y9 at T=37, then 26+H-1=37 -> H-1=11 -> H=12.\n\nBut we took 11 actions: from T=26 to T=36.\n\nThis indicates that the problem's condition might be that we are at y9 at turn t1+H.\n\nThen H=11, and we are at y9 at T=26+11=37.\n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1}=9\". \n\nIf H=11, then t1+H-1=26+10=36. But at T=36, we are at y8, not y9.\n\nSo we are not at y9 until T=37.\n\nTherefore, we need one more action: at T=36 we take U to get to y9 at T=37.\n\nSo the condition y_{t1+H-1}=9 would be satisfied at T=26+H-1 = 36 only if we were at y9 at T=36. But we are not.\n\nTo be at y9 at T=36, we would have to be at y8 at T=35 and then take U at T=35 to get to y9 at T=36.\n\nBut then the action at T=35 would be the last one? Then the sequence would have 10 actions? But we are at y9 at T=36.\n\nHow can we be at y9 at T=36? \n\nWe start at T=26 at y2. We need to cover 7 units up. So minimal 7 actions of U. But we also have to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nWe know we have to detour. The detour we did took 4 moves to get to y2 at T=30. Then 7 moves to get to y9 at T=37.\n\nBut if we can be at y2 at an earlier turn, then we can start the climb earlier.\n\nThe earliest we can be at y2 after the detour is T=30.\n\nWe are at T=30 at y2. Then we need 7 ups: T30:U->y3 at T31, T31:U->y4 at T32, ... T36:U->y9 at T37.\n\nSo we cannot be at y9 before T37.\n\nTherefore, we must be at y9 at T37.\n\nTo have y_{t1+H-1}=9 at T=26+H-1=37, then H-1=11 -> H=12.\n\nBut then the sequence has 12 actions? \n\nBut we only took 11 actions in the above. \n\nWait, if we require to be at y9 at turn t1+H-1, then we must be at y9 at turn 26+H-1.\n\nSet 26+H-1=37 -> H=12.\n\nThen we must take 12 actions? \n\nBut in the above, we took 11 actions and reached y9 at T=37. So if we take 12 actions, then the last action would be at T=26+11=37? But then we would move to y_{38}? \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might consider that we are at the position at the same turn as the action.\n\nBut the update rule says the position changes at the next turn.\n\nGiven the time, I will output the 11 actions that get us to y9 at T=37, and set H=11, and hope that the condition y_{t1+H}=9 is accepted.\n\nBut the problem says y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nIf we set H=12, then we would need to be at y9 at turn 26+11=37. But then the last action is at turn37? But we are already at y9 at turn37, so we don't need to move. But the sequence must have 12 actions? \n\nWe could add a stay at the end? \n\nFor example, after arriving at y9 at T=37, we do an action at T=37: say S, then at T=38 we are still at y9. But then the sequence would have 12 actions, and at turn26+12-1=37, we are at y9? \n\nYes: because the action at turn37 is the 12th action (since t=0 to 11). Then at turn37, we are at y9. And then we do a stay at turn37: but that doesn't change the position. \n\nSo we can do:\n\n  ... \n  Turn36: U -> y37=9\n  Turn37: S\n\nThen we are at y9 at turn37 and turn38.\n\nThen H=12, and at turn26+12-1=37, we are at y9.\n\nAnd the action at turn37 is S.\n\nBut is that allowed? The problem doesn't require that we don't take extra actions, but it says minimal H. \n\nBut with H=12, we have 12 actions. But we can also do it in 11 actions and be at y9 at turn37, but then we are not at y9 at turn36 (which would be 26+11-1=36) -> so if we take 11 actions, then we are at y9 at turn37, which is after the last action.\n\nTherefore, to satisfy the condition of being at y9 at the last action's turn (which is turn26+H-1), we must be at y9 at that turn.\n\nSo in our path, we are at y9 at turn37, so we need to have the last action at turn37? but then we would have taken 12 actions.\n\nAnd the position at turn37 (before the action) is y9? or after?\n\nLet me clarify the timing:\n\n  At turn t, we are at position y_t.\n  We take action a_t, and then we are at y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta.\n\n  So at the start of turn t, we are at y_t.\n\n  We want to be at y9 at the start of turn26+H-1.\n\n  So for turn26+H-1, we have y_{26+H-1} = 9.\n\n  How is that achieved? \n      y_{26} = 2 (given)\n      then by actions, we update to y_{27}, y_{28}, etc.\n\n  We need y_{26+H-1} = 9.\n\n  The actions taken are at turns: 26, 27, ..., 26+H-2.\n\n  Because the action at turn26+H-2 will determine y_{26+H-1}.\n\n  So the sequence of actions is from turn26 to turn26+H-2, which is (H-1) actions? \n\n  But the problem says: the sequence is {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} -> that's H actions: for t=0: turn26, t=1: turn27, ... t=H-1: turn26+H-1.\n\n  Then the action at turn26+H-1 is included, and then the position after that action is y_{26+H} = y_{26+H-1} + Delta_{26+H-1}.\n\n  But we want y_{26+H-1}=9.\n\n  This means that at the start of turn26+H-1, we are at 9. Then we take an action at that turn, which might move us away? \n\n  To keep at 9, we would have to choose S.\n\n  So in our case, we want to be at y9 at turn37.\n\n  So 26+H-1=37 -> H-1=11 -> H=12.\n\n  Then the actions are from turn26 to turn37 (12 actions).\n\n  The last action (at turn37) should be S to stay at 9.\n\n  And the position at turn37 is 9 (at the start), and then we do S, so we remain at 9 at turn38.\n\n  But the condition is met: at turn26+H-1=26+12-1=37, we are at y9.\n\n  So we need to include an extra stay at the end.\n\n  Therefore, the sequence has 12 actions.\n\n  The first 11 actions are as before, and the 12th action is S at turn37.\n\n  But wait, in our earlier plan, we reached y9 at turn37 (at the start of turn37) from the action at turn36. \n\n  So at turn37, we are at y9. Then we take action S at turn37 to stay.\n\n  So the actions are:\n\n      Turn26: D\n      Turn27: D\n      Turn28: U\n      Turn29: U\n      Turn30: U\n      Turn31: U\n      Turn32: U\n      Turn33: U\n      Turn34: U\n      Turn35: U\n      Turn36: U   [this gets us to y9 at turn37]\n      Turn37: S   [we stay at y9]\n\n  Then at turn37, we are at y9 (at the start), and then we do S, and we are still at y9 at turn38.\n\n  So the condition is satisfied: at turn26+H-1=26+12-1=37, we are at y9.\n\n  And we took 12 actions.\n\n  Is there a way with H=11? \n      We would need to be at y9 at turn26+11-1=36.\n      So y_{36}=9.\n      How can we achieve that? \n          We start at y2 at turn26.\n          We need to go up 7 units, but also avoid the unsafe times.\n          The earliest we can be at y2 after the detour is turn30.\n          Then from turn30 to turn36: 6 actions. \n          In 6 actions, we can go up 6 units (from y2 to y8). \n          Then at turn36, we are at y8, not y9.\n\n      To be at y9 at turn36, we would have to be at y8 at turn35 and then take U at turn35.\n      But to be at y8 at turn35, we would have to start the climb at turn29: \n          turn29: y2\n          turn30: y3\n          turn31: y4\n          turn32: y5\n          turn33: y6\n          turn34: y7\n          turn35: y8\n          turn36: y9\n\n      But we are at y2 at turn30, not turn29.\n\n      Can we be at y2 at turn29? \n          We are at y2 at turn26.\n          From turn26 to turn29: 3 actions.\n          We need to get to y2 at turn29.\n\n          We have to avoid:\n              turn27: cannot be at y3,4,5\n              turn28: cannot be at y1,2\n              turn29: cannot be at y6,7,8\n\n          We start at y2 at turn26 (safe).\n          turn26: we can do:\n                S: y27=2 (safe at turn27: freeway2 safe)\n                D: y27=1 (safe)\n                U: unsafe (y3 at turn27: unsafe)\n\n          If we do S: then at turn27: y2.\n          turn27: then we must avoid being at y2 at turn28 (unsafe). \n                So we can go U to y3 at turn28: safe (freeway3 safe at turn28).\n                Or D to y1 at turn28: unsafe.\n                Or S: unsafe.\n\n          So go U: turn27: U -> y28=3.\n          turn28: at y3, safe.\n          turn28: then we can go to y2, y3, or y4.\n                But at turn29, we cannot be at y6,7,8 -> but we are at y2,y3,y4 -> safe.\n                We want to be at y2 at turn29.\n                So we can go down: D -> y29=2.\n\n          So we can be at y2 at turn29.\n\n          Then the moves:\n              turn26: S\n              turn27: U\n              turn28: D\n              turn29: we are at y2.\n\n          Then from turn29: \n                turn29: U -> y30=3\n                turn30: U -> y31=4\n                turn31: U -> y32=5\n                turn32: U -> y33=6\n                turn33: U -> y34=7\n                turn34: U -> y35=8\n                turn35: U -> y36=9\n\n          Then we are at y9 at turn36.\n\n          And we took actions from turn26 to turn35: 10 actions.\n\n          Then H=10, and at turn26+10-1=35, we are at y9? \n             turn35: action U is taken, then y36=9.\n             So at turn36, we are at y9.\n             But we want at turn35 to be at y9? \n                turn35: at the start of turn35, we are at y8 (because the action at turn34: U got us to y8 at turn35).\n                Then at turn35, we take U, and then at turn36 we are at y9.\n\n          So at turn35, we are at y8, not y9.\n\n          Therefore, to be at y9 at turn35, we would have to be at y9 at the start of turn35.\n\n          How? \n             We would have to reach y9 by turn34: \n                 turn34: at y9.\n             Then from y2 at turn29, we need to go up 7 units in 5 actions (turn29 to turn33) -> impossible (minimal 7 ups).\n\n          So we cannot be at y9 before turn36.\n\n          Therefore, with this path, we are at y9 at turn36.\n\n          Then to have y_{26+H-1}=9 at turn36, we set 26+H-1=36 -> H=11.\n\n          Then the sequence has 11 actions: from turn26 to turn35.\n\n          The last action is at turn35: U, which gets us to y9 at turn36.\n\n          And at turn36, we are at y9, but the condition is for turn35? \n\n          The condition is for turn26+H-1=26+11-1=36: we want y36=9.\n\n          But the action at turn35: U, gives y36 = y35 + 1 = 8+1=9.\n\n          So at turn36, we are at y9.\n\n          How do we know y35? \n             In this path: \n                 turn29: y29=2\n                 turn29: action U -> y30=3\n                 turn30: U -> y31=4\n                 turn31: U -> y32=5\n                 turn32: U -> y33=6\n                 turn33: U -> y34=7\n                 turn34: U -> y35=8\n                 turn35: U -> y36=9\n\n          So at turn35, we are at y8. The action at turn35 (U) is taken, and then at turn36 we are at y9.\n\n          Therefore, at the start of turn35, we are at y8, and at the start of turn36, we are at y9.\n\n          So for turn35 (which is turn26+10), we are at y8, not y9.\n\n          But we want at turn26+H-1=36 to be at y9.\n\n          And we are.\n\n          So the condition is met at turn36.\n\n          Therefore, this path works with H=11.\n\n          Let me verify the collisions:\n\n          turn26: at y2, safe.\n          turn26: S -> y27=2.\n          turn27: at y2, safe (freeway2 at T=27: safe).\n          turn27: U -> y28=3.\n          turn28: at y3, safe (freeway3 at T=28: safe).\n          turn28: D -> y29=2.\n          turn29: at y2, safe (freeway2 at T=29: safe).\n          turn29: U -> y30=3.\n          turn30: at y3, safe? freeway3 at T=30: unsafe! \n                T=30: freeway3: car3: [-59+12*4=-59+48=-11, -48+48=0] -> covers 0 -> unsafe.\n\n          Oh no! at turn30, we are at y3, and freeway3 is unsafe.\n\n          So we cannot be at y3 at T=30.\n\n          This path is invalid.\n\nHow about if at turn29, we do not go to y3 at turn30? \n\n          turn29: at y2, we can do:\n                U: to y3 at turn30 -> unsafe.\n                D: to y1 at turn30 -> safe (freeway1 safe at T=30).\n                S: to y2 at turn30 -> safe.\n\n          If we do D: \n                turn29: D -> y30=1.\n          Then at turn30: safe.\n          Then we can go up from there, but then we are at y1 at turn30, and we need 8 ups to get to y9, which would take to turn38.\n\n          If we do S: \n                turn29: S -> y30=2.\n          Then at turn30: safe.\n          Then we can go up starting turn30.\n\n          But then we are at y2 at turn30, and we do:\n\n                turn30: U -> y31=3 (safe, because T=31: all safe)\n                turn31: U -> y32=4\n                ...\n                turn37: U -> y38=9\n\n          Then we are at y9 at turn38.\n\n          Actions: 12 actions? \n             turn26: S\n             turn27: U\n             turn28: D\n             turn29: S\n             turn30: U\n             turn31: U\n             turn32: U\n             turn33: U\n             turn34: U\n             turn35: U\n             turn36: U\n             turn37: U\n\n          Then at turn38, we are at y9.\n\n          And we need to be at y9 at turn26+H-1. \n             Set 26+H-1=38 -> H=13.\n\n          Which is worse than the first path.\n\nTherefore, the first path (with down at the beginning) and then up, and then an extra stay, with H=12, is valid and has 12 actions.\n\nBut we can try to optimize the second approach to avoid the unsafe freeway at turn30.\n\n After turn29: we are at y2. \n   turn29: we can go down to y1 at turn30: safe.\n   then at turn30: y1, safe.\n   then we go up:\n\n        turn30: U -> y31=2\n        turn31: U -> y32=3\n        ... \n        turn37: U -> y38=9\n\n   actions: \n        turn26: S (1)\n        turn27: U (2)\n        turn28: D (3)\n        turn29: D (4)  [y29=2 -> y30=1]\n        turn30: U (5)  [1->2]\n        turn31: U (6)  [2->3]\n        turn32: U (7)\n        turn33: U (8)\n        turn34: U (9)\n        turn35: U (10)\n        turn36: U (11)\n        turn37: U (12)\n\n   then at turn38: y9.\n\n   To be at y9 at turn26+H-1=38, then H-1=12 -> H=13.\n\n   Then we need to add a stay at turn38? \n        turn38: S -> y39=9\n\n   then at turn38 (start) we are at y9, then we do S.\n\n   Then the action at turn38 is the 13th action.\n\n   So H=13.\n\n   This is worse.\n\nGiven the above, the first path (starting with down) with a final stay has 12 actions and is valid.\n\nBut in the first path, after 11 actions we are at y9 at turn37, and then we do a stay at turn37 to ensure we are at y9 at turn37 (at the start) for the condition? \n   In the first path, we are at y9 at the start of turn37 because of the action at turn36.\n   Then at turn37, we are at y9. \n   The condition for turn26+H-1=26+12-1=37: we are at y9.\n\n   So we do not need to move. We can choose to not take an action? but the sequence requires H actions.\n\n   We take action S at turn37 to satisfy the sequence length.\n\n   It is safe because we are at y9 and not on freeway.\n\nSo the first path is valid and has 12 actions.\n\nBut can we do better? \n\n In the first path, after the detour we are at y2 at turn30. \n   Then we do 7 ups: turn30 to turn36: 7 actions, arriving at y9 at turn37.\n   Plus the detour actions: turn26:D, turn27:D, turn28:U, turn29:U -> 4 actions.\n   Plus the final stay at turn37: 1 action -> total 12.\n\n   But the 7 ups from turn30 to turn36: that's actions at turn30,31,32,33,34,35,36 -> 7 actions.\n\n   So 4 (detour) + 7 (ascent) + 1 (stay) = 12.\n\n Alternatively, we might avoid the final stay if we are at y9 at turn36.\n\n But we cannot because we need 7 ups from y2.\n\n   turn30: y2\n   turn31: y3\n   turn32: y4\n   turn33: y5\n   turn34: y6\n   turn35: y7\n   turn36: y8\n   turn37: y9\n\n So to be at y9 at turn36, we would need to be at y2 at turn29, then do 7 ups from turn29 to turn35, arriving at y9 at turn36.\n\n But we are at y2 at turn30, not turn29.\n\n We can try to be at y2 at turn29.\n\n Earlier we had a way: \n   turn26: S -> y27=2\n   turn27: U -> y28=3\n   turn28: D -> y29=2\n\n   Then at turn29: y2.\n\n   Then from turn29 to turn35: 7 ups.\n\n   turn29: U -> y30=3 (unsafe! freeway3 at T=30 unsafe)\n   -> fails.\n\n   turn29: we cannot go up to y3 at turn30 because unsafe.\n\n   turn29: we can go down to y1 or stay at y2.\n\n   If we go down to y1 at turn30: safe.\n   then we are at y1 at turn30.\n   then we need 8 ups: from turn30 to turn37: 8 actions, arrive at y9 at turn37.\n\n   actions: \n        turn26: S\n        turn27: U\n        turn28: D\n        turn29: D  [ to y1 at turn30]\n        turn30: U  [ to y2 at turn31]\n        turn31: U  [ to y3 at turn32]\n        ...\n        turn37: U  [ to y9 at turn38]\n\n   then we need to be at y9 at turn38, so H=13.\n\n   plus a stay at turn38? then H=14.\n\n   not better.\n\nTherefore, the first path with 12 actions is the best we have.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\n  Turn26: D\n  Turn27: D\n  Turn28: U\n  Turn29: U\n  Turn30: U\n  Turn31: U\n  Turn32: U\n  Turn33: U\n  Turn34: U\n  Turn35: U\n  Turn36: U\n  Turn37: S\n\nBut wait, at Turn36: U -> from y8 at turn36 (start) to y9 at turn37.\nThen at turn37: we are at y9, then we do S.\n\nAnd for collision:\n\n  Let me verify the entire path:\n\n    T=26: y=2 (given), action: D -> will become y=1 at T=27.\n        Collision at T=26: freeway2 safe.\n\n    T=27: y=1, action: D -> will become y=0 at T=28.\n        Collision at T=27: freeway1: [48-36=12,83-36=47] -> safe.\n\n    T=28: y=0, action: U -> will become y=1 at T=29.\n        Collision: y0, no freeway -> safe.\n\n    T=29: y=1, action: U -> will become y=2 at T=30.\n        Collision at T=29: freeway1: [48-36*3=48-108=-60,83-108=-25] -> safe.\n\n    T=30: y=2, action: U -> will become y=3 at T=31.\n        Collision at T=30: freeway2: [48-36*4=48-144=-96,83-144=-61] -> safe.\n\n    T=31: y=3, action: U -> y=4 at T=32.\n        Collision at T=31: freeway3: safe (car3: [-59+12*5=1, -48+60=12] -> doesn't cover 0; car1, car2 are positive) -> safe.\n\n    T=32: y=4, action: U -> y=5 at T=33.\n        freeway4: safe (cars moving right, positive) -> safe.\n\n    T=33: y=5, action: U -> y=6 at T=34.\n        freeway5: safe.\n\n    T=34: y=6, action: U -> y=7 at T=35.\n        freeway6: safe.\n\n    T=35: y=7, action: U -> y=8 at T=36.\n        freeway7: safe.\n\n    T=36: y=8, action: U -> y=9 at T=37.\n        freeway8: at T=36: \n             car1: [-29+6*10=-29+60=31, -18+60=42] -> safe.\n             car2: [37+60=97,48+60=108] -> safe.\n        So safe.\n\n    T=37: y=9, action: S -> y=9 at T=38.\n        not on freeway, safe.\n\n  So no collision.\n\n  Therefore, the minimal H is 12.\n\n  The sequence of actions for turns 26 to 37.\n\nAnswer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 26: D\nTurn 27: D\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: U\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: S\n}\n\nBut the problem asks for the minimal number of turns H.

The sequence of actions is designed to navigate around unsafe freeways at specific turns, as determined by the car positions and movements.\n\n### Collision Avoidance Summary:\n- **Turn 26 (dt=0):** All freeways safe. Start at \\(y = 2\\).\n- **Turn 27 (dt=1):** Freeways 3, 4, 5 unsafe (due to cars covering position 0). Avoid \\(y = 3, 4, 5\\).\n- **Turn 28 (dt=2):** Freeways 1, 2 unsafe.

The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nPlayer movement:\n- U: y increases by 1 (unless at 9, then stays)\n- D: y decreases by 1 (unless at 0, then stays)\n- S: stay at same y\n\nCollision condition: \nAt turn T, if the player is at (0, y_T) and y_T is between 1 and 8, then we check the cars on freeway y_T. \nCollision occurs if 0 (the x-coordinate) is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nNote: When moving, at turn T we are at y_T. Then we choose an action that determines y_{T+1}. \nImportantly, at turn T we are only on freeway y_T. So if we move to a new freeway at turn T+1, we are not on the new freeway until the next turn.\n\nCar movement:\nFor a car at turn t1 (current turn) with head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s:\n- Left-moving (d='left'): the car moves left. At turn T (>=t1), the span is [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n- Right-moving (d='right'): the car moves right. At turn T, the span is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nNote: For a left-moving car, the head is at the right end (so h > tau). As the car moves left, both head and tail decrease.\nFor a right-moving car, the head is at the left end (so h < tau? Actually, the table says for right-moving: (head, tail) but then in the update it uses [tau, h] initially? \n\nLooking at the update:\n- Left: initial span [h, tau] -> becomes [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt]\n- Right: initial span [tau, h] -> becomes [tau + s*dt, h + s*dt]\n\nBut in the table for freeway 3,4,5: we have (48,37,right,12) meaning head=48, tail=37? But then the initial span is [37,48]? That would be a car from 37 to 48, and moving right: so at time T, it becomes [37+12*(T-t1), 48+12*(T-t1)].\n\nBut note: the description says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" meaning the car occupies from tau to h? But if tau=37 and h=48, then the car is from 37 to 48? Then moving right, it shifts right.\n\nHowever, in the table for freeway 8, we have (0,-11,right,6): that would be [ -11, 0 ]? But then moving right, at time T: [-11+6*(T-28), 0+6*(T-28)].\n\nWe have to avoid being at x=0 on a freeway y at turn T if there is a car on that freeway that covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nGoal: start at y=0 at turn 28, and we want to get to y=9 as fast as possible.\n\nThe minimal number of moves in terms of vertical steps: we need to go from 0 to 9 -> 9 steps up. But we can also move down or stay, so the minimal H would be at least 9. However, we might have to wait because of cars.\n\nWe are going to simulate the movement of the player and the cars for each turn.\n\nWe are to output a sequence of actions for turns starting at turn 28 (t=0 in our index) for H turns until we reach y=9.\n\nWe are at turn 28: y=0. We are safe at y=0 because cars are only on freeways 1-8.\n\nWe can only move up (U) to y=1, or stay (S) at y=0, or move down (D) but that would stay at 0 (since at 0, D has no effect). So at turn 28, we must do either S or U.\n\nBut if we do U at turn 28, then at turn 28 we are at y=0, then at turn 29 we will be at y=1. So at turn 29 we are at y=1 and we check the cars on freeway 1.\n\nWe need to check for each freeway and each car, at each turn T, whether if we are on that freeway (i.e., if we are at y=k at turn T) then 0 is not in the span of any car on freeway k at turn T.\n\nLet's compute the car positions at each turn relative to t1=28.\n\nFor a car, let dt = T - 28.\n\nFor freeway 1: one car: (48,83,left,36)\nThis is left-moving. The initial span at t1=28 is [48,83] (but note: for left-moving, the head is 48? and tail 83? That seems backwards because typically head is the front? But the update rule says: left-moving: initial span [h, tau] and then moves left.\n\nBut if h=48 and tau=83, then the car is from 48 to 83? That's a long car? And it moves left.\n\nAt turn T, the span becomes [48 - 36*dt, 83 - 36*dt].\n\nWe need to check if 0 is in [48-36*dt, 83-36*dt] for any T.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1: (48,83,left,36) -> same movement.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: \n(48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nFor right-moving cars: initial span [tau, h] -> becomes [tau + 12*dt, h + 12*dt]\n\nSo:\nCar1: initial [37,48] -> [37+12*dt, 48+12*dt]\nCar2: [1,12] -> [1+12*dt, 12+12*dt]\nCar3: [-35,-24] -> [-35+12*dt, -24+12*dt]\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3.\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (48,37,right,6) -> [37+6*dt, 48+6*dt]\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: \n(48,37,right,6) -> [37+6*dt, 48+6*dt]\n(0,-11,right,6) -> [-11+6*dt, 0+6*dt] = [ -11+6*dt, 6*dt ]\n\nWe are going to simulate turn by turn.\n\nWe want to minimize H. The minimal H without any obstacles would be 9 (all U). Let's check if we can do that.\n\nTurn 28: start at y=0.\n\nTurn 28: action U -> then at turn 29, y=1.\n\nAt turn 29: we are at y=1 -> check freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1 at turn 29 (dt=1): \ncar: [48-36*1, 83-36*1] = [12, 47]. 0 is not in [12,47] -> safe.\n\nTurn 29: action U -> at turn 30, y=2.\n\nAt turn 30: check freeway 2.\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: [48-36*2, 83-36*2] = [48-72, 83-72] = [-24, 11]. \nIs 0 in [-24,11]? Yes. -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot go to freeway 2 at turn 30. Therefore, we must avoid being at y=2 at turn 30.\n\nSo the naive all-U fails at turn 30.\n\nWe need to adjust.\n\nWe can try to wait at some point. For example, at turn 29 we are at y=1. Instead of going up at turn 29, we could stay at y=1 for one turn? Then at turn 30 we are still at y=1. Then at turn 31 we go to y=2.\n\nBut at turn 30, we are at y=1: check freeway 1 at turn 30 (dt=2): \n[48-36*2, 83-36*2] = [48-72, 83-72] = [-24,11]. 0 is in [-24,11] -> collision! So we cannot stay at y=1 at turn 30 either.\n\nTherefore, we must leave y=1 before turn 30? But at turn 29 we are at y=1 and then we have to move at turn 29 to avoid being at y=1 at turn 30? \n\nAt turn 28: we are at y=0. We have two choices: U or S.\n\nIf we do S at turn 28: then at turn 29 we are still at y=0 (safe). Then at turn 29 we can do U -> to y=1 at turn 30.\n\nBut at turn 30: we are at y=1 -> freeway 1: [48-36*2, 83-36*2]=[-24,11] -> collision.\n\nAlternatively, at turn 28: we do U -> to y=1 at turn 29 (safe as we saw). Then at turn 29, instead of U, we do S? Then at turn 30 we are at y=1 -> collision.\n\nOr at turn 29, we do D? Then we go back to y=0 at turn 30. Then we are safe at y=0. But that doesn't help.\n\nSo we must avoid being at y=1 at turn 30? Then what about being at y=2 at a different time? \n\nWe need to see when freeway 1 is safe. The car on freeway 1: [48-36*dt, 83-36*dt]\n\nWe want 0 not in [48-36*dt, 83-36*dt] -> so either 0 < 48-36*dt or 0 > 83-36*dt.\n\nCase 1: 0 < 48-36*dt -> 36*dt > 48 -> dt > 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.33 -> so dt>=2? But at dt=2, we have 48-72=-24, which is negative, but 0 is greater than -24? Actually, the interval is [48-36*dt, 83-36*dt]. At dt=2: [-24,11] -> 0 is in it.\n\nWe require 0 < 48-36*dt OR 0 > 83-36*dt.\n\n0 < 48-36*dt -> 36*dt < 48 -> dt < 48/36 = 4/3 -> so dt=1: then 48-36=12>0 -> so 0 is less than 12? But the interval is [12,47] and 0 is not in it -> safe at dt=1.\n\nBut for dt>=2: 48-36*dt <= 48-72 = -24 <=0, and 83-36*dt >= 83-72=11? Actually at dt=2: [-24,11] -> 0 is in it.\n\nAt dt=3: [48-108, 83-108] = [-60,-25] -> 0 is not in it? because -60<=0<=-25? no, 0 is greater than -25 -> so 0 is not in [-60,-25]. So at dt=3, freeway1 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway2: same car, so same pattern: safe at dt=1 and dt>=3? and unsafe at dt=0? but we are not at freeway2 at dt=0. Actually, we are at turn 28: freeway2 at dt=0: [48,83] -> 0 is not in [48,83]? so safe? But we don't go to freeway2 at turn28 because we start at y=0.\n\nBut we are concerned about when we are at that freeway.\n\nSo freeway1: unsafe at dt=2? Actually, we saw at dt=1: safe, dt=2: unsafe, dt=3: safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway2: same.\n\nNow freeway3,4,5: three cars.\n\nCar1: [37+12*dt, 48+12*dt] -> 0 in interval when 37+12*dt <=0<=48+12*dt? \nBut 37+12*dt is always positive for dt>=0 -> so 0 is never in this interval? Because the car is entirely in the positive x.\n\nCar2: [1+12*dt, 12+12*dt] -> always positive? so 0 not in.\n\nCar3: [-35+12*dt, -24+12*dt] -> 0 in this interval when -35+12*dt <=0<= -24+12*dt?\n-> 12*dt <=35 and 12*dt>=24 -> 24<=12*dt<=35 -> 2<=dt<=35/12≈2.916 -> so dt=2 and 3? \nAt dt=2: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0] -> 0 is in it? \nAt dt=3: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12] -> 0 is not in it? \nWait: at dt=2: [-11,0] -> 0 is the right endpoint? included? -> collision.\nAt dt=3: [1,12] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway3,4,5: \n- Car1 and Car2 are always in positive x -> safe.\n- Car3: unsafe at dt=2? and dt= ? only dt=2? because at dt=0: [-35,-24] -> 0 not in; dt=1: [-23,-12] -> not; dt=2: [-11,0] -> yes; dt=3: [1,12] -> no.\n\nSo freeway3,4,5: unsafe at dt=2? (which is turn 28+2=30)\n\nSimilarly, freeway6: one car: [37+6*dt,48+6*dt] -> always positive -> safe always.\n\nFreeway7: same.\n\nFreeway8: two cars:\nCar1: [37+6*dt,48+6*dt] -> always positive -> safe.\nCar2: [-11+6*dt, 6*dt] -> 0 in the interval when -11+6*dt <=0<=6*dt?\nThis is always true for dt>=0? because 6*dt>=0 and -11+6*dt <=0 when 6*dt<=11 -> dt<=11/6≈1.83 -> so for dt=0,1? \nAt dt=0: [-11,0] -> 0 included -> unsafe.\nAt dt=1: [-5,6] -> 0 in it? yes.\nAt dt=2: [1,12] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway8: unsafe at dt=0 and dt=1? (turns 28 and 29) and safe for dt>=2.\n\nNow, we are at turn 28: we are at y=0 (safe, because we are not on freeway). We want to go to y=9.\n\nWe must avoid:\n- Being at y=1 at dt=2 (turn30) because freeway1 is unsafe at dt=2.\n- Being at y=2 at dt=2 (turn30) because freeway2 is unsafe at dt=2? Actually, we saw freeway2 has the same car as freeway1 -> unsafe at dt=2.\n- Being at y=3,4,5 at dt=2 (turn30) because freeway3,4,5 are unsafe at dt=2? \n  Actually, we saw freeway3,4,5 have a car (the third one) that causes collision at dt=2? so yes, unsafe at turn30 for freeways 3,4,5.\n- Freeway6,7: safe at all times? \n- Freeway8: unsafe at dt=0 and dt=1? but at turn28 (dt=0) we are not at freeway8? and at turn29 (dt=1) we are at freeway8 only if we are at y=8 at turn29.\n\nBut note: we are at y=0 at turn28. We cannot be at y=8 at turn29? because we can only move one step per turn.\n\nSo the problem at turn30 (dt=2) is that freeways 1,2,3,4,5 are all unsafe? \n- Freeway1: unsafe at dt=2 -> turn30\n- Freeway2: same -> unsafe at dt=2\n- Freeway3: unsafe at dt=2 -> turn30\n- Freeway4: same\n- Freeway5: same\n- Freeway6: safe\n- Freeway7: safe\n- Freeway8: safe at dt=2 (since dt=2>=2)\n\nTherefore, at turn30 (dt=2), the only safe freeways are 6,7,8? and 0? and 9? (but we are not at 0 or 9 then).\n\nBut we are at y=0 at turn28. We can only move one step per turn. \n\nAt turn28: we are at y=0. We do U -> turn29: y=1.\nAt turn29: we are at y=1. Now we can do U to y=2, D to y=0, or S at y=1.\n\nBut if we do U at turn29: then at turn30 we are at y=2 -> freeway2 at turn30: unsafe.\nIf we do S at turn29: then at turn30 we are at y=1 -> freeway1: unsafe.\nIf we do D at turn29: then at turn30 we are at y=0 -> safe.\n\nSo at turn29 we must do D? Then we go back to y=0 at turn30.\n\nBut then we are back to start? and we have to start over.\n\nAlternatively, we might try to go to a safe freeway at turn30? The safe freeways at turn30 are 6,7,8. But we are at y=1 at turn29. How can we be at y=6,7, or 8 at turn30? We can only move one step per turn -> from y=1 we can only go to y=0,1,2. So we cannot get to y=6,7,8 at turn30.\n\nTherefore, the only safe option at turn30 is to be at y=0 or y=9? or y=6,7,8? but we cannot reach 6,7,8 from 1 in one move.\n\nSo we must avoid being at freeways 1-5 at turn30? and we can't be at 6,7,8 at turn30 from y=1? so the only safe place at turn30 is y=0 or y=9? but we can't get to y=9 from y=1 in one move.\n\nTherefore, we must be at y=0 at turn30? which means at turn29 we must go down to 0.\n\nBut then we are at turn30 at y=0. Then we can try again.\n\nBut we lost a turn.\n\nThen at turn30: we are at y=0. Then we can go up at turn30 to y=1 at turn31.\n\nNow at turn31: dt=3 (because T=31, t1=28 -> dt=3). \n\nCheck freeway1 at dt=3: [48-36*3, 83-36*3] = [48-108,83-108] = [-60,-25] -> safe (0 not in).\nFreeway2: same -> safe.\n\nFreeway3,4,5: at dt=3: \nCar3: [-35+12*3, -24+12*3] = [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\nFreeway6,7: always safe.\nFreeway8: at dt=3: safe (since dt>=2).\n\nSo at turn31, all freeways are safe? \n\nSo we can then proceed? \n\nBut we are at turn30: y=0 -> safe. Then at turn30 we do U -> turn31: y=1 (freeway1: safe at dt=3).\n\nThen we can do U at turn31: to y=2 at turn32? \nAt turn32: dt=4 (T=32, t1=28 -> dt=4). \nFreeway2: [48-36*4,83-36*4]=[48-144,83-144]=[-96,-61] -> safe.\n\nThen U at turn32: to y=3 at turn33 (dt=5). \nFreeway3: at dt=5: \nCar3: [-35+12*5, -24+12*5]=[-35+60,-24+60]=[25,36] -> safe? 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, freeway4,5 same.\n\nThen we can go up: \nturn33: y=3 -> then at turn33 we do U -> turn34: y=4 -> freeway4: same as freeway3? safe at dt=6? \ndt=6: freeway4: Car3: [-35+12*6, -24+12*6]=[-35+72,-24+72]=[37,48] -> safe.\n\nThen turn34: U -> turn35: y=5 -> freeway5: same, safe.\n\nThen turn35: U -> turn36: y=6 -> freeway6: [37+6*dt,48+6*dt] at dt=8 (since T=36, dt=8): [37+48,48+48]=[85,96] -> safe.\n\nThen turn36: U -> turn37: y=7 -> freeway7: same car? [37+6*dt,48+6*dt] at dt=9: [37+54,48+54]=[91,102] -> safe.\n\nThen turn37: U -> turn38: y=8 -> freeway8: \nCar1: [37+6*dt,48+6*dt] at dt=10: [37+60,48+60]=[97,108] -> safe.\nCar2: [-11+6*dt,6*dt] at dt=10: [-11+60,60]=[49,60] -> safe.\n\nThen turn38: U -> turn39: y=9 -> goal.\n\nTotal turns: from turn28 to turn39: that's 12 turns? \nWe did 11 actions? \n\nLet's list the turns:\n\nTurn28: start at y0=0.\nAction at turn28: U -> turn29: y=1.\nAt turn29: D? -> turn30: y=0.   [But wait, we changed plan: we are going to do D at turn29 to avoid collision at turn30?]\n\nBut in the above plan, we did:\n\nAt turn28: we did U -> turn29: y=1.\nAt turn29: we did D -> turn30: y=0. \nThen at turn30: we do U -> turn31: y=1. \nThen U at turn31: y2 at turn32: y=2.\nThen U at turn32: y3 at turn33: y=3.\nThen U at turn33: y4 at turn34: y=4.\nThen U at turn34: y5 at turn35: y=5.\nThen U at turn35: y6 at turn36: y=6.\nThen U at turn36: y7 at turn37: y=7.\nThen U at turn37: y8 at turn38: y=8.\nThen U at turn38: y9 at turn39: y=9.\n\nSo the actions from turn28 to turn38 (11 actions) and we reach at turn39? \n\nBut we started at turn28: that's the first turn. We do 11 actions: \nactions at: turn28,29,30,...,38 (11 actions) and then at turn39 we are at y=9.\n\nBut note: we are to output actions for turns starting at t1=28 for H turns, and we reach at turn t1+H-1? \n\nThe sequence: \nWe have H actions: a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}. \nThen the player position at turn t1+H is (0,9). \n\nIn our sequence: \n- After 0 actions: at turn28: y=0.\n- After 1 action (turn28): we are at turn29: y=1.\n- After 2 actions (turn28,29): at turn30: y=0.\n- ...\n- After 11 actions (turn28 to 38): at turn39: y=9.\n\nSo we need H=11 actions.\n\nBut we might do better? \n\nWe avoided the unsafe turn30 by going back to 0. But is there a way to avoid going back?\n\nWe could try to be at a safe freeway at turn30. The safe freeways at turn30 (dt=2) are 6,7,8? but we are at y=1 at turn29. We cannot jump to y=6,7,8 in one move.\n\nAlternatively, we could stay at y=0 at turn28? Then at turn29: we are still at y=0? Then at turn29 we do U: to y=1 at turn30 -> but at turn30: y=1 is unsafe.\n\nSo we must not be at y=1 at turn30? \n\nAnother idea: at turn28, we do S (stay). Then at turn29: still at y=0. Then at turn29: we do U: to y=1 at turn30 -> unsafe.\n\nAlternatively, at turn28: we do U to y=1 at turn29. Then at turn29: we do nothing? Then at turn30: y=1 -> unsafe.\n\nOr at turn28: we do U to y=1 at turn29, then at turn29: we do D to y=0 at turn30 -> safe. This is what we did.\n\nIs there a way to skip the freeways 1-5 without having to go back? \n\nNote that we can only move one step per turn. We have to pass through freeways 1 to 8.\n\nWe could try to go up to y=1 at turn29, then at turn29 we do nothing? but then at turn30 we are at y=1 -> unsafe.\n\nOr we could go up to y=1 at turn29, then at turn29 we go up to y=2 at turn30? -> unsafe at freeway2.\n\nSo we have to avoid freeways 1-5 at turn30? \n\nBut what if we go up very quickly? We start at turn28: y=0. If we could go up two steps in one turn, we can't. \n\nAlternatively, we could wait at y=0 until the unsafe period is over? \n\nBut at turn30: freeways1-5 are unsafe. But at turn31: they become safe.\n\nSo if we start at turn28: \nOption: \nturn28: S (stay at y=0) \nturn29: S (stay at y=0) \nThen at turn30: we are at y=0 -> safe. \nThen at turn30: we do U -> turn31: y=1 (freeway1: dt=3 -> safe) \nThen we can go up without stopping? \n\nBut we spent two turns at y=0? \n\nThen the sequence would be:\n\nturn28: S\nturn29: S\nturn30: U -> to y=1 at turn31.\nturn31: U -> y=2 at turn32.\nturn32: U -> y=3 at turn33.\nturn33: U -> y=4 at turn34.\nturn34: U -> y=5 at turn35.\nturn35: U -> y=6 at turn36.\nturn36: U -> y=7 at turn37.\nturn37: U -> y=8 at turn38.\nturn38: U -> y=9 at turn39.\n\nThat's 11 actions? \nActions: turn28: S, turn29: S, turn30: U, ... turn38: U -> 11 actions? same as before.\n\nBut we reached at turn39 in both cases.\n\nBut note: in the first plan we did:\nturn28: U\nturn29: D\nturn30: U\nturn31: U\n... up to turn38: U -> 11 actions.\n\nSame length.\n\nBut we might do better? \n\nWhat if we go up to y=1 at turn29 (by U at turn28), then at turn29 we don't go down? but we must avoid being at y=1 at turn30? \n\nAlternatively, we could go to y=1 at turn29, and then at turn29 we go up to y=2 at turn30? but that's unsafe.\n\nOr we could try to go to a freeway that is safe at turn30? The only safe freeways at turn30 are 6,7,8? but we cannot reach them from y=1 in one move.\n\nSo the minimal H is 11? \n\nBut wait: we must get from 0 to 9: 9 moves up. But we have two extra moves: one down (in the first plan) or two stays (in the second plan). So both are 11 moves.\n\nBut is there a way without the extra moves?\n\nWe need to avoid being at freeways 1-5 at turn30. But we are forced to be at one of them at turn30 if we start moving up at turn28? \n\nUnless we start moving later? \n\nWe start at turn28: we can choose to move at turn28 or not.\n\nIf we do nothing at turn28 and turn29: then at turn30 we are at y=0. Then we start moving at turn30. Then we can go up 9 moves: from turn30 to turn38: 9 moves? Then we are at y=9 at turn39? That's 10 moves? \n\nLet me count:\n\nTurn28: action? We are at y=0 at the beginning of turn28. We choose an action for turn28.\n\nOption: \nturn28: S -> then at turn29: we are at y=0.\nturn29: S -> then at turn30: we are at y=0.\nThen we start moving:\nturn30: U -> turn31: y=1 (dt=3: safe)\nturn31: U -> turn32: y=2 (dt=4: safe)\nturn32: U -> turn33: y=3 (dt=5: safe)\nturn33: U -> turn34: y=4 (dt=6: safe)\nturn34: U -> turn35: y=5 (dt=7: safe)\nturn35: U -> turn36: y=6 (dt=8: safe)\nturn36: U -> turn37: y=7 (dt=9: safe)\nturn37: U -> turn38: y=8 (dt=10: safe)\nturn38: U -> turn39: y=9.\n\nSo we did 11 actions: S (t28), S (t29), U (t30), U (t31), ... U (t38) -> 11 actions? \n\nBut we have 11 actions: t28 to t38, and we reach at turn39.\n\nAlternatively, if we do:\n\nturn28: S\nturn29: U -> then at turn30: we are at y=1? -> unsafe? because at turn30: freeway1: unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot do that.\n\nSo the two options are either:\nOption1: \nturn28: U -> y=1 at t29\nturn29: D -> y=0 at t30 (safe)\nthen turn30: U -> y=1 at t31 (safe)\n... then up to turn38: U -> y=9 at t39.\n\nOption2:\nturn28: S -> y=0 at t29\nturn29: S -> y=0 at t30\nturn30: U -> y=1 at t31\n... same.\n\nBoth 11 actions.\n\nBut note: in option1, we did an extra move: up then down. That might be acceptable.\n\nBut is there a shorter path? H=10? \n\nWe need to reach y=9 at turn t1+H-1 = 28+H-1.\n\nWe want to minimize H.\n\nWe must have at least 9 moves up. And we cannot avoid having at least two extra moves? because of the obstacle at turn30.\n\nBut let me see: we start at turn28: y0=0.\n\nWe want to be at y=9 at turn T.\n\nThe moves: we need 9 up moves. But we can interleave with down or stay.\n\nBut every down move or stay move adds one extra turn.\n\nSo minimal H is 9? but we saw we cannot do 9 because we get stuck at turn30.\n\nSo minimal is 10? \n\nBut in 10 actions, we can have 10 moves: 9 up and one extra? \n\nWe need 9 net up moves. So if we do 10 moves: 9 up and one down? then we end at y=8? not 9.\n\nOr 10 moves: 10 up? but we cannot because we start at 0: we can only go to 9 in 9 moves? but we can go beyond? no, because the update: if at 9 and do U, stays at 9. So we can only get to 9 in 9 moves? but we have to avoid the obstacles.\n\nBut we cannot do 9 moves because of the obstacle at turn30.\n\nSo we must have at least 10 moves? \n\nLet me count: \nWe need to be at y=9 at turn T. The earliest turn we can be at y=9 is turn28+9 = turn37? \nBecause: \nturn28: start at 0.\nturn29: y=1\nturn30: y=2\n...\nturn37: y=9.\n\nBut at turn30: we are at y=2 -> freeway2: unsafe? as we saw.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=2 at turn30? \n\nTherefore, we must avoid being at y=2 at turn30. \n\nWe can be at y=2 at a later turn? \n\nBut at turn37 we want to be at y=9. \n\nWe can delay the move to freeway2? \n\nFor example: \nturn28: S -> turn29: y=0\nturn29: U -> turn30: y=1 -> unsafe? because freeway1 at turn30: unsafe.\n\nOr:\nturn28: U -> turn29: y=1 (safe)\nturn29: S -> turn30: y=1 -> unsafe.\n\nOr:\nturn28: U -> turn29: y=1 (safe)\nturn29: U -> turn30: y=2 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be at freeway1 or freeway2 at turn30? \n\nWhat if we are at freeway3 at turn30? then unsafe too? because freeway3 is unsafe at turn30.\n\nSimilarly, freeway4,5: unsafe.\n\nSo we must be at y=0, or y=6,7,8 at turn30? \n\nBut we start at y=0 at turn28. How to be at y=6,7,8 at turn30? \n\nAt turn28: we do U -> turn29: y=1.\nAt turn29: we do U -> turn30: y=2 -> not 6,7,8.\n\nWe cannot jump.\n\nSo the only safe y at turn30 is 0? \n\nTherefore, we must be at y=0 at turn30.\n\nSo we have two ways:\n\nWay1: \nturn28: U -> y=1 at turn29\nturn29: D -> y=0 at turn30\n\nWay2:\nturn28: S -> y=0 at turn29\nturn29: S -> y=0 at turn30\n\nIn both, we are at y=0 at turn30.\n\nThen from turn30, we start going up: \nturn30: U -> y=1 at turn31 (safe, dt=3)\nturn31: U -> y=2 at turn32 (safe, dt=4)\nturn32: U -> y=3 at turn33 (safe, dt=5)\nturn33: U -> y=4 at turn34 (safe, dt=6)\nturn34: U -> y=5 at turn35 (safe, dt=7)\nturn35: U -> y=6 at turn36 (safe, dt=8)\nturn36: U -> y=7 at turn37 (safe, dt=9)\nturn37: U -> y=8 at turn38 (safe, dt=10)\nturn38: U -> y=9 at turn39.\n\nSo we have 11 actions? \n\nBut in way1: \nactions: \nt28: U\nt29: D\nt30: U\nt31: U\n...\nt38: U -> 11 actions? \n\nIn way2: \nt28: S\nt29: S\nt30: U\nt31: U\n...\nt38: U -> 11 actions.\n\nBut note: in way1, we did 11 actions and reached at turn39? \nThe actions are from t28 to t38: 11 actions -> the last action at t38 leads to y=9 at t39.\n\nIs there a way to do 10 actions? \n\nSuppose we do 10 actions: then we are at turn38? and we want to be at y=9 at turn38? \n\nBut from turn28 to turn38: 10 turns? \n\nIf we do 10 actions: \nAfter 10 actions, we are at turn38.\n\nWe start at turn28: y0=0.\n\nAfter 10 actions, we are at turn38: we want y=9.\n\nThe net displacement: we need 9 up moves. \n\nBut we have 10 moves: so we can have 9 up and one down? then net 8 up -> y=8? not 9.\n\nOr 10 up? then we would be at y= min(10,9)=9? \n\nBut we can do 10 up moves: \nturn28: U -> y=1 at t29\nturn29: U -> y=2 at t30 -> unsafe? \n\nBut if we avoid the unsafe turn by not being at y=2 at t30? \n\nBut we must be at y=2 at some turn? \n\nWe can do:\n\nWe need to be at y=0 at turn30? \n\nThen from turn30 to turn38: 8 moves? we need 9 up moves to go from 0 to 9? \n\nSo we cannot.\n\nIf we do 10 moves: \nWe have to have at least 9 up moves to get to 9. And we have one extra move that must be either down or stay? then we end at 8 or 9? but we need 9.\n\nIf we do 10 up moves: \nBut then we are at y=9 at turn38? \nBut we have to pass through the freeways.\n\nStart:\nt28: U -> t29: y=1 (safe)\nt29: U -> t30: y=2 (unsafe) -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, which sequence to choose? \n\nWe can choose either way1 or way2. \n\nBut note: we might have to check if there are other obstacles? \n\nIn the way1: \nWe go up at t28: to y=1 at t29 -> safe (dt=1: freeway1: [12,47] safe).\nThen down at t29: to y=0 at t30 -> safe (y=0).\n\nThen up at t30: to y=1 at t31 -> freeway1 at dt=3: [-60,-25] safe.\nThen up at t31: to y=2 at t32 -> freeway2 at dt=4: [-96,-61] safe.\nThen up at t32: to y=3 at t33 -> freeway3 at dt=5: \n   Car3: [25,36] -> safe.\nThen up at t33: to y=4 at t34 -> freeway4 at dt=6: Car3: [37,48] -> safe.\nThen up at t34: to y=5 at t35 -> freeway5 at dt=7: Car3: [49,60] -> safe.\nThen up at t35: to y=6 at t36 -> freeway6: [37+6*8,48+6*8]=[37+48,48+48]=[85,96] -> safe.\nThen up at t36: to y=7 at t37 -> freeway7: same as freeway6? [37+6*9,48+6*9]=[37+54,48+54]=[91,102] -> safe.\nThen up at t37: to y=8 at t38 -> freeway8 at dt=10:\n   Car1: [37+60,48+60]=[97,108] -> safe.\n   Car2: [-11+60,60]=[49,60] -> safe.\nThen up at t38: to y=9 at t39.\n\nSo no collisions.\n\nIn way2: \nt28: S -> t29: y=0\nt29: S -> t30: y=0\nt30: U -> t31: y=1 (freeway1: safe as above)\n... same as above.\n\nBut in way2, we did two S at the beginning? \n\nWe can output either. But we want minimal H? both H=11.\n\nBut we can also consider if we can be at y=9 earlier? \n\nWe saw we cannot.\n\nTherefore, we choose one.\n\nI'll choose way1: because we make progress earlier? \n\nSo the sequence of actions:\n\nTurn28: U\nTurn29: D\nTurn30: U\nTurn31: U\nTurn32: U\nTurn33: U\nTurn34: U\nTurn35: U\nTurn36: U\nTurn37: U\nTurn38: U\n\nBut wait, we have 11 actions? \nFrom turn28 to turn38: 11 turns? \n\nBut the answer format: we list from turn28 to turn28+10? \n\nH=11, so t from 0 to 10: 11 actions.\n\nWe list:\n\nTurn t_1 (28): a_{28} = U\nTurn t_1+1 (29): a_{29} = D\nTurn t_1+2 (30): a_{30} = U\nTurn t_1+3 (31): a_{31} = U\nTurn t_1+4 (32): a_{32} = U\nTurn t_1+5 (33): a_{33} = U\nTurn t_1+6 (34): a_{34} = U\nTurn t_1+7 (35): a_{35} = U\nTurn t_1+8 (36): a_{36} = U\nTurn t_1+9 (37): a_{37} = U\nTurn t_1+10 (38): a_{38} = U\n\nBut we don't have to list beyond when we reach? but we reach at turn39, so the last action is at turn38.\n\nAlternatively, we could do:\n\nTurn28: S\nTurn29: S\nTurn30: U\nTurn31: U\n... same as above until turn38: U.\n\nBut that's also 11 actions.\n\nI think the first one is acceptable.\n\nBut note: in the first one, at turn29 we are at y=1 and we do D: that's moving down? but we are at y=1: moving down to y=0 is allowed.\n\nSo we'll output the first sequence.\n\nBut let me double-check the freeway8 at turn38? \n\nAt turn38: we are at y=8? \nThe turn is T=38, dt=38-28=10.\nFreeway8: \nCar1: [37+6*10,48+6*10]=[37+60,48+60]=[97,108] -> safe.\nCar2: [-11+6*10, 0+6*10] = [-11+60,60] = [49,60] -> safe.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd then at turn38 we do U: to y=9 at turn39.\n\nSo we are done.\n\nBut the problem says: we must reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nt1=28, H=11, so we reach at turn 28+11-1 = 38+? \n\nt1+H-1 = 28+11-1 = 38? \n\nBut we are at y=9 at turn39? \n\nLet me clarify:\n\nAt the start of turn28: we are at (0,0).\nWe choose an action a28 for turn28.\nAfter applying a28, at the start of turn29, we are at a new position.\n\nThe position at the start of turn T is (0, y_T).\n\nWe are to find a sequence of actions for H turns: a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1} such that at the start of turn t1+H, we are at (0,9).\n\nSo: \nAfter H actions (from turn t1 to t1+H-1), we are at turn t1+H.\n\nWe want at turn t1+H: y = 9.\n\nIn our sequence:\nWe do 11 actions: from turn28 to turn38 (inclusive) -> so the last action is at turn38, and then at turn39 we are at y=9? \n\nBut turn39 = 28 + 11? -> 28+11=39? yes.\n\nSo turn t1+H = 28+11 = 39 -> we are at (0,9). Correct.\n\nTherefore, H=11.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: D\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: U\nTurn 38: U\n}\n\nBut wait, we have 11 lines? \n\nTurn28 to Turn38: 11 turns? \n\nYes.\n\nWe can write:\n\nTurn 28: U\nTurn 29: D\nTurn 30: U\nTurn 31: U\nTurn 32: U\nTurn 33: U\nTurn 34: U\nTurn 35: U\nTurn 36: U\nTurn 37: U\nTurn 38: U\n\nThis is the sequence.\n</think>\nTo reach the goal position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn 28 in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1 to 8, the following sequence of actions is determined. The minimal number of turns required is 11, as the player must avoid being on freeways 1 to 5 at turn 30 (relative turn difference dt = 2 from turn 28), where collisions would occur due to car positions covering x = 0. The sequence involves moving up to y = 1 at turn 29, then moving down to y = 0 at turn 30 to avoid the unsafe freeways, followed by consecutive up moves to reach y = 9 by turn 39.\n\nThe actions are as follows:\n\n- At turn 28, move up (U) to reach y = 1 at turn 29. Freeway 1 is safe at dt = 1 (turn 29), as the car span [48 - 36(1), 83 - 36(1)] = [12, 47] does not contain 0.\n- At turn 29, move down (D) to return to y = 0 at turn 30. This avoids being on any freeway (y = 1 to 8) at turn 30 (dt = 2), where freeways 1 to 5 are unsafe (e.g., freeway 1: [48 - 36(2), 83 - 36(2)] = [-24, 11] contains 0).\n- From turn 30 onward, move up (U) consecutively:\n  - At turn 30, move up to y = 1 at turn 31. Freeway 1 is safe at dt = 3 (turn 31), as [48 - 36(3), 83 - 36(3)] = [-60, -25] does not contain 0.\n  - At turn 31, move up to y = 2 at turn 32. Freeway 2 is safe at dt = 4 (turn 32), as [48 - 36(4), 83 - 36(4)] = [-96, -61] does not contain 0.\n  - At turn 32, move up to y = 3 at turn 33. Freeway 3 is safe at dt = 5 (turn 33), as the car spans (e.g., the third car: [-35 + 12(5), -24 + 12(5)] = [25, 36]) do not contain 0.\n  - At turn 33, move up to y = 4 at turn 34. Freeway 4 is safe at dt = 6 (turn 34), as car spans (e.g., third car: [-35 + 12(6), -24 + 12(6)] = [37, 48]) do not contain 0.\n  - At turn 34, move up to y = 5 at turn 35. Freeway 5 is safe at dt = 7 (turn 35), as car spans (e.g., third car: [-35 + 12(7), -24 + 12(7)] = [49, 60]) do not contain 0.\n  - At turn 35, move up to y = 6 at turn 36. Freeway 6 is safe at dt = 8 (turn 36), as the car span [37 + 6(8), 48 + 6(8)] = [85, 96] does not contain 0.\n  - At turn 36, move up to y = 7 at turn 37. Freeway 7 is safe at dt = 9 (turn 37), as the car span [37 + 6(9), 48 + 6(9)] = [91, 102] does not contain 0.\n  - At turn 37, move up to y = 8 at turn 38. Freeway 8 is safe at dt = 10 (turn 38), as both cars (first: [37 + 6(10), 48 + 6(10)] = [97, 108]; second: [-11 + 6(10), 0 + 6(10)] = [49, 60]) do not contain 0.\n  - At turn 38, move up to y = 9 at turn 39, reaching the goal.\n\nThis sequence of 11 actions ensures the player reaches (0, 9) at turn 39 (28 + 11 - 1 = 39, as the position is updated at the start of the next turn) without any collisions.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 28: U \\\\\nTurn 29: D \\\\\nTurn 30: U \\\\\nTurn 31: U \\\\\nTurn 32: U \\\\\nTurn 33: U \\\\\nTurn 34: U \\\\\nTurn 35: U \\\\\nTurn 36: U \\\\\nTurn 37: U \\\\\nTurn 38: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,1) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 29, and I start at y=1.\n\nFirst, I should understand how the cars move. For left-moving cars, the span shifts left by speed times time, and for right-moving, it shifts right. Collision happens if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T and 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nThe note says that if I move to a different y at turn T, I'm not considered on that new y until the next turn, so I only care about the cars on my current y at each turn.\n\nSince I start at y=1 at turn 29, and I need to reach y=9, which is the top, and y=0 to y=9 are the rows, with y=9 being the goal.\n\nThe vertical axis is y=0 to 9, so y=9 is the target row.\n\nNow, the actions: U for up (increase y by 1), D for down (decrease y by 1), S for stay (y unchanged). And y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nI need to minimize H, the number of turns, so I probably want to go up as fast as possible, but I have to avoid the cars on the rows I'm on when they are at x=0.\n\nx=0 is the player's x-position, always 0, and cars are on different y-levels, and I need to not be on a row when a car covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nThe collision condition: at turn T, if y_T is the row I'm on, and for any car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at turn T.\n\nThe freeway is the y-level, so for each row, there are cars moving horizontally.\n\nIn the car state table, for each freeway k (which is y=k), there are cars with head, tail, direction, speed.\n\nDirection: left or right.\n\nFor left-moving, head and tail: it says for left-moving, span is [h, τ], and for right-moving, it's [τ, h], so in the table, for left, h and τ, with h probably the right end or something? Let's see the update.\n\nFor left-moving car: at t_1, span is [h, τ], and at T, it becomes [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: span at t_1 is [τ, h], at T, [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the collision, we care if 0 is in the span at turn T.\n\nNow, for freeway k=1: cars: (12,47,left,36)\n\nk=1 is y=1 row.\n\nAt turn t_1=29, car on y=1: head=12, tail=47, left, speed=36.\n\nDirection left, so span at t_1 is [h, τ] = [12,47]? But that would be from 12 to 47, which is increasing, but left-moving should be decreasing x, I think there's confusion.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ]\" and it shifts left.\n\nBut if h and τ are positions, and it's moving left, so if [h, τ] with h < τ, then shifting left means both decrease, so the interval moves left.\n\nBut typically, for a car, head might be the front.\n\nIn this case, for left-moving, head=12, tail=47, but 12 to 47, if it's left-moving, and span [12,47], that would be from x=12 to x=47, but moving left, so at later time, it shifts to smaller x.\n\nBut for collision at x=0, we care when the span covers 0.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, span [τ,h] and shifts right.\n\nIn the table for k=3,4,5, there are multiple cars.\n\nLet's list all cars at t_1=29.\n\nFreeway y=1: one car: (12,47,left,36) so direction left, span at t_1=29: [h,τ] = [12,47], so from x=12 to x=47.\n\nSince left-moving, speed 36, so at time T, span is [12 - 36*(T-29), 47 - 36*(T-29)]\n\nSimilarly, y=2: same as y=1: (12,47,left,36) so identical car.\n\ny=3: three cars: (60,49,right,12), (24,13,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nDirection right, so for each, span at t_1 is [τ,h] since right-moving.\n\nFirst car: τ=60, h=49? But τ and h, if right-moving, span [τ,h], but if τ=60, h=49, that would be [60,49], which is empty if 60>49, or if we consider min max.\n\nI think there might be a notation issue.\n\nFor right-moving, it says \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" and it moves right.\n\nBut if τ and h are given, and for example (60,49,right,12), if τ=60, h=49, then [τ,h] = [60,49], which is invalid if we assume τ < h or something.\n\nPerhaps h is always the head, and for left-moving, head is on the left, for right-moving, head on the right.\n\nLet's infer from the update.\n\nFor left-moving: span [h, τ] -> [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt]\n\nFor right-moving: span [τ, h] -> [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt]\n\nSo for the span to be valid, for left-moving, we need h <= τ, so that [h,τ] is from smaller to larger x.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, [τ,h] with τ <= h.\n\nIn the data, for y=1: (12,47,left,36), so h=12, τ=47, so since left-moving, span [12,47], which is from x=12 to x=47.\n\nFor y=3: (60,49,right,12), but direction right, span [τ,h] = [60,49]? But 60>49, so if [60,49], it's from 60 to 49, which is backwards, or should it be [min,max]?\n\nI think there's a mistake in my interpretation.\n\nPerhaps for right-moving, τ is the tail, h is the head, and tail is left, head is right, so span should be [tail, head] for both, but the notation differs.\n\nLet's read the text: \"For car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail is at τ\"\n\nIt says head at h, tail at τ for both directions.\n\nThen for left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ]\" and it shifts left.\n\nBut if head is at h, and it's left-moving, the head should be the front, so for left-moving, head is smaller x, tail is larger x, so span [h,τ] with h < τ.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, head is larger x, tail is smaller x, so span [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nIn the data, for y=1: (12,47,left,36), head=12, tail=47, so h=12, τ=47, and since left-moving, head is left, tail is right, so span [12,47], yes.\n\nFor y=3: (60,49,right,12), head=60, tail=49, but for right-moving, head should be larger x, tail smaller x, but here head=60, tail=49, so tail=49, head=60, so span [τ,h] = [49,60]? No.\n\nThe text says: for right-moving, \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" and it moves right.\n\nBut with head and tail: if head is at h, tail at τ, for right-moving, head is right, so h > τ, so span [τ, h] with τ < h.\n\nIn (60,49,right,12), it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed), so for this, head=60, tail=49, but tail=49, head=60, so for right-moving, tail should be left, head right, so τ=49, h=60, so span [τ,h] = [49,60].\n\nSimilarly, the next car (24,13,right,12), head=24, tail=13, so for right-moving, head=24 > tail=13, so span [13,24].\n\nAnd (-12,-23,right,12), head=-12, tail=-23, head=-12 > tail=-23, so span [-23,-12].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn the table, it's listed as (head, tail, direction, speed), and for right-moving, head > tail, for left-moving, head < tail, from the examples.\n\ny=1: head=12, tail=47, 12<47, left-moving.\n\ny=3: (60,49,right,12) 60>49, so head>tail for right.\n\n(24,13,right,12) 24>13, head>tail.\n\n(-12,-23,right,12) -12 > -23, yes.\n\ny=6: (54,43,right,6) 54>43, head>tail.\n\ny=8: (54,43,right,6) and (6,-5,right,6) 6>-5.\n\nAll consistent.\n\nSo back to collision: at turn T, if I am on freeway k, and for any car on k, 0 is in its span at T.\n\nSpan for left-moving car at T: [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)] for given h,τ at t_1.\n\nSimilarly for right: [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nNow t_1=29.\n\nI start at y=1 at t=29.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince I can only change y by at most 1 per turn, minimum turns to go from y=1 to y=9 is 8 turns, if I go up every turn.\n\nBut I need to avoid the cars on each row at the times I'm there.\n\nI might have to stay or move down sometimes to avoid, but since I want min turns, I should go up as much as possible, only deviate if necessary.\n\nBut moving down might cost extra turns, so I need to see if I can go straight up in 8 turns without collision.\n\nLet's check for each row from y=1 to y=8, what times are safe to be on that row, i.e., when no car covers x=0.\n\ny=9 has no cars, since freeways are y=1 to 8, so once I reach y=9, I'm safe, no collision.\n\nThe goal is to reach (0,9), and I can be there at turn T, and since no cars on y=9, it's fine.\n\nNow, for each row, I need the times when it is safe to be there, meaning that at that turn, for all cars on that row, 0 is not in their span.\n\nSince multiple cars, I need for each car, 0 not in span.\n\nLet's define the time from t_1=29.\n\nSet Δt = T - 29, so T = 29 + Δt.\n\nThen for each car, span at T.\n\nFirst, for y=1: one car, left-moving, h=12, τ=47, s=36.\n\nSpan at T: [12 - 36 Δt, 47 - 36 Δt]\n\n0 in span if 12 - 36 Δt <= 0 <= 47 - 36 Δt\n\nSince left-moving, the span is moving left, so 0 is covered when the left end is <=0 and right end >=0.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo for y=1 car: 12 - 36 Δt <= 0 and 47 - 36 Δt >= 0\n\nWhich is: 12 - 36 Δt <= 0 => 12 <= 36 Δt => Δt >= 12/36 = 1/3\n\nAnd 47 - 36 Δt >= 0 => 47 >= 36 Δt => Δt <= 47/36 ≈ 1.3056\n\nSo 0 in span for Δt from ceil(1/3) to floor(47/36), but Δt integer since turns.\n\nΔt is integer, T integer.\n\nSo 12 - 36 Δt <= 0 => Δt >= 12/36 = 1/3, so since Δt integer, Δt >= 1\n\nAnd 47 - 36 Δt >= 0 => Δt <= 47/36 ≈ 1.305, so Δt <= 1\n\nΔt <= 1 and Δt >=1, so Δt=1\n\nFor Δt=1: 12 - 36*1 = 12-36= -24 <=0, 47-36=11 >=0, yes 0 in [-24,11].\n\nFor Δt=0: 12-0=12>0, 47>0, 0 not <=12? 0 <12, so 0 not in [12,47], since 12>0.\n\nSimilarly Δt=2: 12-72= -60 <=0, 47-72= -25 <0? 47-72=-25, which is less than 0, and -60 <=0 but -25<0, so 0 not <= -25? The span is [-60,-25], which is negative, 0 not in it.\n\nSo only at Δt=1, i.e., T=29+1=30, the car covers x=0.\n\nFor other times, no collision on y=1.\n\nAt T=30, if I am on y=1, collision.\n\nBut at t=29, I am on y=1, and at T=29, Δt=0, not covered, as above.\n\nNow y=2: same car, (12,47,left,36), so identical to y=1, so only unsafe at T=30.\n\ny=2 has same car, so same behavior.\n\nNow y=3: three cars, all right-moving, speed 12.\n\nFirst car: (60,49,right,12), head=60, tail=49, direction right.\n\nSpan at t_1: [τ, h] = [49,60] since right-moving.\n\nAt T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [49 + 12 Δt, 60 + 12 Δt]\n\n0 in span if 49 + 12 Δt <= 0 <= 60 + 12 Δt\n\nBut 49 +12 Δt >=49 >0 for all Δt>=0, so 0 <= 49 +12 Δt false, since left side 0, right side >0, so 0 < 49+12Δt, so not <=, so 0 not in [49+12Δt, 60+12Δt] for any Δt, since min is 49>0.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (24,13,right,12), head=24, tail=13, span at t_1: [τ,h] = [13,24]\n\nAt T: [13 +12 Δt, 24 +12 Δt]\n\n0 in span: 13+12Δt <=0 <=24+12Δt\n\n13+12Δt >=13>0, so <=0 false, so never.\n\nThird car: (-12,-23,right,12), head=-12, tail=-23, so for right-moving, τ=tail=-23, h=head=-12, span [τ,h] = [-23,-12]\n\nAt T: [ -23 +12 Δt, -12 +12 Δt ]\n\n0 in span: -23 +12 Δt <= 0 <= -12 +12 Δt\n\nWhich is:\n\n-23 +12 Δt <= 0 => 12 Δt <= 23 => Δt <= 23/12 ≈ 1.916, so Δt <= 1 since integer? Δt <= floor(23/12)=1? 23/12=1.916, so Δt <=1\n\nAnd 0 <= -12 +12 Δt => 12 <= 12 Δt => Δt >=1\n\nSo Δt >=1 and Δt <=1, so Δt=1\n\nFor Δt=1: -23+12= -11 <=0, -12+12=0 <=0, so 0 in [-11,0], yes.\n\nAt other times, not.\n\nSo for y=3, only unsafe at T=30.\n\nNow y=4: same as y=3, three cars, all same, so only unsafe at T=30.\n\ny=5: same as y=3 and 4, only unsafe at T=30.\n\nNow y=6: one car, (54,43,right,6), head=54, tail=43, direction right.\n\nSpan at t_1: [τ,h] = [43,54]\n\nAt T: [43 +6 Δt, 54 +6 Δt]\n\n0 in span: 43+6Δt <=0 <=54+6Δt\n\n43+6Δt >=43>0, so <=0 false, never covered, since min 43>0.\n\nSo y=6 is always safe, no car covers x=0 at any time.\n\nSimilarly, y=7: same car, (54,43,right,6), identical to y=6, so always safe.\n\nNow y=8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (54,43,right,6), same as above, never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: (6,-5,right,6), head=6, tail=-5, direction right.\n\nSpan at t_1: [τ,h] = [-5,6] since τ=tail=-5, h=head=6.\n\nAt T: [ -5 +6 Δt, 6 +6 Δt ]\n\n0 in span: -5 +6 Δt <= 0 <= 6 +6 Δt\n\nNow, 6+6 Δt >=6>0, so 0 <=6+6Δt always true for Δt>=0.\n\nAnd -5 +6 Δt <=0 => 6 Δt <=5 => Δt <= 5/6 ≈0.833, so Δt <=0 since integer.\n\nFor Δt=0: -5 <=0 <=6, true, 0 in [-5,6]\n\nFor Δt=1: -5+6=1 <=0? 1<=0 false, and 0<=6+6=12 true, but 1<=0 false, so not both.\n\n0 in span iff left <=0 and right >=0.\n\nAt Δt=0: left=-5<=0, right=6>=0, yes.\n\nAt Δt=1: left=1 >0, not <=0, so 0 not in [1,12]\n\nSimilarly, for Δt>=1, left = -5+6Δt, at Δt=0: -5, Δt=1:1, etc, all >=1 for Δt>=1, >0.\n\nSo only at Δt=0, T=29, unsafe.\n\nFor other Δt, safe.\n\nSo for y=8, unsafe only at T=29.\n\nSummary of unsafe times for each row:\n\ny=1: unsafe at T=30\n\ny=2: unsafe at T=30 (same as y=1)\n\ny=3: unsafe at T=30\n\ny=4: unsafe at T=30\n\ny=5: unsafe at T=30\n\ny=6: always safe\n\ny=7: always safe\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=29, safe otherwise.\n\ny=8 unsafe only at T=29.\n\nNow, I start at t=29, y=1.\n\nAt t=29, I am on y=1, which is safe at t=29, as we saw earlier.\n\ny=8 is unsafe at t=29.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nI want to minimize turns, so go up.\n\nBut I have to be careful at certain times.\n\nSince multiple rows are unsafe only at T=30, and I start at t=29 y=1.\n\nIf I go up at t=29, then at t=30 I would be at y=2.\n\nBut y=2 is unsafe at t=30, so if I am on y=2 at t=30, collision.\n\nIf I stay at t=29, I remain on y=1 at t=30, but y=1 is unsafe at t=30, also collision.\n\nIf I go down to y=0 at t=30, but y=0 might be safe, but I need to go up eventually.\n\ny=0 has no cars? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so always safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 safe.\n\nSo at t=29, I am at y=1, safe.\n\nNow, if I do U: at t=30, I move to y=2, but at t=30, y=2 is unsafe, so collision.\n\nIf I do S: at t=30, I am still on y=1, which is unsafe at t=30, collision.\n\nIf I do D: at t=30, I go to y=0, which is safe, since no cars.\n\nSo at t=29, I must do D to avoid collision at t=30, because staying or going up both put me on a row that is unsafe at t=30.\n\nBut going down to y=0 is safe.\n\nThen at t=30, I am at y=0.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9 from here.\n\nBut y=0 is safe, but I need to go up.\n\nNow, at t=30, if I go up, to y=1, but at t=30, y=1 is unsafe, so if I go to y=1 at t=30, I am on y=1 at t=30, which is unsafe, collision.\n\nIf I stay at y=0, safe, but not progressing.\n\nOr go down, but y=0, if I go down, y= min 0, so if I do D at y=0, I stay at y=0, since y cannot go below 0.\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, with Δy from action, and y in [0,9], so if at y=0 and do D, Δy=-1, but y=0-1=-1 not in [0,9], so probably y_{t+1} = max(0, min(9, y_t + Δy)), so at y=0, D keeps at 0, similarly at y=9, U keeps at 9.\n\nSo at t=30, I am at y=0.\n\nActions: U: to y=1, but at t=31? Let's see.\n\nAt turn T, I am on y_T, and collision depends on cars at T.\n\nAt t=30, I am on y=0 (if I came from t=29 D).\n\ny=0 has no cars, so safe.\n\nIf I do U at t=30, then at t=31, I will be on y=1? No.\n\nTurn-based: at turn t, I choose action a_t, then y_{t+1} is determined.\n\nPosition at turn t is (0, y_t).\n\nAfter action, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nAnd at turn t, I am on freeway y_t, and collision if for that freeway, 0 in span at t.\n\nSimilarly at t+1, on y_{t+1}, etc.\n\nIn this case, at t=29, I am on y=1, safe.\n\nI choose action a_{29}.\n\nIf a_{29} = D, then y_{30} = y_{29} + (-1) = 1 -1 =0.\n\nAt t=30, I am on y=0, no cars, safe.\n\nNow at t=30, I choose action a_{30}.\n\nIf I do U, then y_{31} = y_{30} +1 =0+1=1.\n\nAt t=31, I am on y=1.\n\nNow, is y=1 safe at t=31?\n\nFrom earlier, for y=1, unsafe only at t=30, which is past, so at t=31, Δt=31-29=2, span [12-36*2,47-36*2]=[12-72,47-72]=[-60,-25], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, other rows.\n\nAfter t=30, T=30 is past, so all rows are safe except y=8 at t=29, but t=29 is also past.\n\nUnsafe times were only at specific turns.\n\ny=1 only unsafe at t=30\n\ny=2 at t=30\n\ny=3 at t=30\n\ny=4 at t=30\n\ny=5 at t=30\n\ny=8 at t=29\n\ny=6 and y=7 always safe.\n\nFor t>30, all should be safe, since no other unsafe times.\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=29, which is before, so for t>=30, all rows safe? y=8 at t=31, etc.\n\nFor y=8, unsafe only at t=29, so for t=30 and after, safe.\n\nSimilarly for others, only unsafe at t=30 or before, so for t>=31, all rows y=1 to 8 are safe.\n\nIs that true?\n\ny=1: unsafe only t=30, so t=31 safe.\n\ny=2 same.\n\ny=3: unsafe only t=30, t=31 safe.\n\nSimilarly y=4,5.\n\ny=6,7 always safe.\n\ny=8: unsafe only t=29, so t=30 and after safe.\n\nYes.\n\nSo from t=31 onwards, all rows are safe to be on.\n\nBut at t=30, if I am on y=0, safe, or on other rows, unsafe except y=6,7.\n\ny=6 and y=7 always safe, so at t=30, I could be on y=6 or y=7, safe.\n\nBut I start at y=1 at t=29.\n\nBack to the situation.\n\nAt t=29, I must do something to avoid being on y=1,2,3,4,5 at t=30, since all unsafe at t=30.\n\nOptions:\n\n- Do D at t=29: go to y=0 at t=30, safe.\n\n- Or, go up to y=2? But if I do U at t=29, I go to y=2 at t=30, but y=2 unsafe at t=30, collision.\n\nSimilarly, S to y=1 at t=30, collision.\n\nSo only safe action at t=29 is D, to y=0 at t=30.\n\nThen at t=30, I am at y=0.\n\nNow, at t=30, I can choose action.\n\nI want to go up.\n\nIf I do U at t=30, I go to y=1 at t=31.\n\nAt t=31, y=1 is safe, as above.\n\nThen I can continue up.\n\nBut let's see the minimal path.\n\nFrom y=0 at t=30, I need to reach y=9.\n\ny=0 to y=9, min 9 steps? From y=0 to y=9, difference 9, so min 9 actions to go up each time.\n\nBut I can do it in 9 turns from t=30.\n\nt=30 to t=38, for example.\n\nSince from t=31 onwards all safe, I can go straight up.\n\nBut let's confirm.\n\nAt t=30, y=0.\n\nDo U: at t=31, y=1 (safe)\n\nDo U: at t=32, y=2 (safe)\n\n...\n\nUp to y=9 at t=39? Let's count.\n\nStart: t=30, y=0\n\nAfter first U: t=31, y=1\n\nt=32, y=2\n\nt=33, y=3\n\nt=34, y=4\n\nt=35, y=5\n\nt=36, y=6\n\nt=37, y=7\n\nt=38, y=8\n\nt=39, y=9\n\ny=9 at t=39.\n\nBut at t=39, I reach y=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=30 to t=39, that's 10 turns? Let's see the sequence.\n\nActions at t=30 to t=38, 9 actions, to go from y=0 to y=9.\n\ny_{t+1} after action.\n\nAt time t, position y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1}.\n\nSo to change y, need actions.\n\nFrom y=0 at t=30, after 9 actions (U each), at t=31 y=1, t=32 y=2, ..., t=39 y=9.\n\nSo H = number of actions, from t=30 to t=38, actions at t=30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38, that's 9 actions, reach y=9 at t=39.\n\nBut we started from t=29.\n\nAt t=29, we did one action D, to be at y=0 at t=30.\n\nThen actions from t=30 to t=38: 9 actions.\n\nTotal turns: from t=29 to t=39, but the actions are from t=29 to t=38, 10 actions? Let's clarify.\n\nThe sequence of actions: we need actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, such that after H actions, at turn t_1 + H, position is (0,9).\n\nStart at turn t_1 =29, position (0,1).\n\nAfter first action at t=29, position at t=30.\n\nAfter second action at t=30, position at t=31, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, position at turn t_1 + H.\n\nAnd we want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nIn this case, if we do nothing, we need to go from y=1 to y=9, min 8 actions if all up.\n\nBut we have the issue at t=30.\n\nWith the down, we go to y=0, then up 9 times, total 10 actions.\n\nBut perhaps we can do better.\n\nAt t=29, instead of going down, can we go to a safe row at t=30?\n\nAt t=30, which rows are safe?\n\ny=1,2,3,4,5 unsafe at t=30.\n\ny=6 and y=7 always safe, so safe at t=30.\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=29, but at t=30 safe.\n\ny=0 safe.\n\nBut I am at y=1 at t=29.\n\nCan I reach y=6 or y=7 at t=30?\n\nFrom y=1 to y=6 in one step? No, I can only change by +1, -1, or 0 per turn.\n\nSo from y=1 at t=29, after one action, at t=30, I can be at y=0, y=1, or y=2.\n\ny=0: safe\n\ny=1: unsafe\n\ny=2: unsafe\n\ny=6 or y=7 not reachable in one step.\n\nSo only possible to go to y=0 at t=30 by doing D at t=29.\n\nNo other choice.\n\nThen from there, as above.\n\nBut total actions: at t=29: D\n\nThen from t=30 to t=38: U each, 9 actions.\n\nActions at t=29, t=30, t=31, ..., t=38.\n\nThat's 10 actions: t=29 to t=38 inclusive? t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1 =29, actions at times t=29,30,31,..., up to t=29 + H -1.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H.\n\nSet position at turn T.\n\nAt T=29, y=1.\n\nAfter action at T=29, position at T=30.\n\nAfter action at T=30, position at T=31, etc.\n\nAfter H actions, position at T=29 + H.\n\nWe want y_{29+H} =9.\n\nNow, y starts at 1.\n\nEach U increases y by 1, D decreases by 1, S keeps.\n\nNet change must be +8 to go from 1 to 9.\n\nBut with constraints.\n\nIn the above plan: action at T=29: D, so y_{30} = 1 + (-1) =0\n\nThen actions: a_{30} to a_{38}: all U, so y_{31}=1, y_{32}=2, ..., y_{39}=9\n\nSo at T=39, y=9.\n\nH actions: from t=29 to t=38, that's 10 actions (29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38).\n\nH=10, since t=29 to t=38 is 10 actions.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =38, t_1=29, so 29 + H -1 =38, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nAnd y_{29+10}=y_{39}=9.\n\nCan I do with fewer actions?\n\nMinimal H: since I need to increase y by 8, min H=8 if all up, but not possible because at t=30 I must not be on y=1-5.\n\nWith H=8, actions from t=29 to t=36.\n\nAfter 8 actions, position at t=37.\n\ny_{37} must be 9.\n\nStart y_{29}=1.\n\nIf all U, y_{37} =1 +8 =9, but at t=30, I would be at y=2 if I do U at t=29, but y=2 unsafe at t=30.\n\nIf I do S or D at some point to avoid.\n\nBut at t=30, if I am not on y=1-5, but from y=1 at t=29, at t=30 I can only be at y=0,1,2.\n\ny=0 safe, but if I go to y=0 at t=30, then to reach y=9 at t=37, I need to go from y=0 to y=9 in 7 actions? From t=30 to t=37.\n\nAt t=30 position, after actions at t=30 to t=36, 7 actions, to y_{37}.\n\ny_{30} to y_{37}, 7 steps, max increase 7, from y_{30}=0 to y_{37}=7 at best, not 9.\n\ny_{30} is position after action at t=29? Let's set.\n\nAt t=29, y=1.\n\nAfter a_{29}, y_{30}.\n\nThen after a_{30}, y_{31}, ..., after a_{29+H-1}, y_{29+H}.\n\nWe want y_{29+H} =9.\n\nFor H=8, y_{29+8}=y_{37}=9.\n\ny_{29}=1.\n\nNet change over 8 actions: +8, so must be all U actions, no S or D, because S or D would decrease net change.\n\nEach U: +1, D: -1, S:0.\n\nNet change must be +8 for y to increase from 1 to 9 in 8 actions.\n\nSo all actions must be U.\n\nThen sequence: a_{29}=U, y_{30}=2\n\na_{30}=U, y_{31}=3\n\n...\n\na_{36}=U, y_{37}=9\n\nBut at t=30, y_{30}=2, which is on freeway y=2 at turn t=30, and y=2 unsafe at t=30, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nIf I do not do U all, but to have net +8, must all U.\n\nSo impossible with H=8.\n\nSimilarly H=9: actions from t=29 to t=37, y_{38}=9.\n\ny_{29}=1, to y_{38}=9, net +8, so 8 U actions and one other, but net +8 requires exactly 8 U and 0 S or D? With 9 actions, if I have 8 U and one S, net +8, y from 1 to 9.\n\nOr 8 U and one D, net +7, y=1+7=8<9.\n\nSo must be 8 U and one S, or all 9 U but that would be y=10>9, not allowed.\n\ny in [0,9], so if at y=9, U keeps at 9.\n\nBut to reach exactly 9.\n\nWith 9 actions, from y=1 to y=9, net +8, so must have 8 U and one S or something.\n\nActions: let k_U be number of U, k_D number of D, k_S number of S.\n\nThen k_U + k_D + k_S = H\n\nNet y change: k_U - k_D = 8\n\nSince start y=1, end y=9.\n\nAlso, y must stay in [0,9].\n\nNow for H=9: k_U + k_D + k_S =9\n\nk_U - k_D =8\n\nAdd: 2 k_U + k_S =17, so k_U <=8 since 2*8=16, +k_S=17, so k_S=1, k_U=8, k_D=0.\n\nSimilarly, from k_U - k_D=8, and k_U + k_D + k_S=9, subtract: (k_U + k_D + k_S) - (k_U - k_D) =9-8 => 2 k_D + k_S=1, so since k_D and k_S nonneg int, possibilities: k_D=0, k_S=1 or k_D=1, k_S=-1 impossible, so only k_D=0, k_S=1, k_U=8.\n\nSo must have 8 U and 1 S.\n\nNow, the S action must be at a time when I am on a row that is safe, but since all rows are safe except at specific times, and I need to avoid being on y=1-5 at t=30.\n\nIn this sequence, with 9 actions, I start at t=29 y=1.\n\nAfter actions, at t=38 y=9.\n\nThe position at intermediate turns.\n\nAt t=30, y_{30} must be such that it is not on unsafe row at t=30.\n\nUnsafe rows at t=30: y=1,2,3,4,5.\n\nSo y_{30} must be 0,6,7, or 8.\n\nBut y_{30} depends on a_{29}.\n\ny_{30} = y_{29} + Δy_{29} = 1 + Δy_{29}\n\nΔy_{29} from a_{29}: U: +1, so y=2; D: -1, y=0; S:0, y=1.\n\nSo y_{30} can be 2,0, or 1.\n\nNow, 2 is unsafe, 1 unsafe, 0 safe.\n\nSo only possible y_{30}=0, by doing D at t=29.\n\nThen y_{30}=0.\n\nNow, from here, I need to reach y_{38}=9 with 8 more actions? Actions from t=30 to t=37, 8 actions.\n\ny_{38} = y_{30} + net change from actions t=30 to t=37.\n\ny_{30}=0, y_{38}=9, net +9, but with 8 actions? Each action can change y by at most 1, so max increase 8, to y=8, not 9.\n\ny_{38} is after 8 actions from t=30 to t=37.\n\ny_{30} to y_{38} with actions at t=30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37: 8 actions.\n\nStart y_{30}=0, end y_{38}=9, but 9-0=9, so need +9 with 8 actions, impossible, since max +8.\n\ny_{38} = y_{30} + sum_{t=30 to 37} Δy_t\n\nΔy_t <=1, so y_{38} <= 0 + 8 =8 <9.\n\nCannot reach y=9 with only 8 actions from y=0.\n\nIf I do U at y=8, I can go to 9, but with 8 actions from y=0, max y=8.\n\nThen at t=38, y=8, I need another action to go to y=9 at t=39.\n\nBut for H=9, we want to reach at t=29+9=38.\n\nWith actions t=29 to t=37, position at t=38.\n\nIf at t=38 y=8, not 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at t=38, I need y_{38}=9.\n\nBut from above, with a_{29}=D, y_{30}=0, then with 8 actions to y_{38}, max y=8.\n\nIf I don't do S, but in H=9, I must have one S, but S doesn't help increasing.\n\nPerhaps I do the S later.\n\nBut from y=0, with 8 actions, I can at best be at y=8 at t=38.\n\nThen not 9.\n\nIf I start with U at t=29, but then y_{30}=2, unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo H=9 impossible.\n\nSimilarly, H=10 is possible as before.\n\nBut earlier with H=10, we reach at t=39.\n\nPerhaps I can reach faster by using the safe rows.\n\nFor example, at t=29, I do D to y=0 at t=30.\n\nThen at t=30, instead of going up immediately, I could go to a row that is closer, but y=6 and y=7 are safe, but from y=0, I need to go up step by step.\n\nI have to pass through all rows.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6 and y=7 are always safe, I could go directly to them if possible, but I can only move one step per turn.\n\nAt t=30, I am at y=0.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nMin turns from here: 9 actions to y=9.\n\nBut if I go to y=6 or y=7 faster? No, min 6 steps to y=6 from y=0, etc.\n\nBut I still need to go to y=9.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid the unsafe rows by timing.\n\nBut in this case, after t=30, all rows are safe at all times, so I can go straight up.\n\nNo need to detour.\n\nIn the H=10 plan, I go from y=0 to y=9 in 9 up actions, but at t=30 y=0, t=31 y=1, ..., t=39 y=9.\n\nBut at t=31, y=1 is safe, since t=31>30.\n\nSimilarly all.\n\nBut the first action at t=29 is D.\n\nNow, is there a way with H=9? Seems not, as above.\n\nPerhaps I can do S at some point, but not helpful.\n\nAnother thought: at t=29, I do nothing, but I have to take action.\n\nOr, can I be on y=8 at t=30? But from y=1, not possible.\n\ny=8 is safe at t=30, but I can't reach it.\n\nSo I think H=10 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm the sequence.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn t_1 =29: a_{29} = D  (to avoid collision at t=30)\n\nThen at t=30, position y=0.\n\nNow, from here, I can go up.\n\nBut at t=30, I am on y=0, safe.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nSince all future times safe, I can do U repeatedly.\n\nBut let's list the actions.\n\nTurn 29: D\n\nThen turn 30: U  (to y=1 at t=31)\n\nTurn 31: U  (y=2 at t=32)\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 38: U  (y=9 at t=39)\n\nActions from turn 29 to turn 38: that's 10 actions.\n\nTurn 29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38.\n\nAfter last action at turn 38, position at turn 39 is (0,9).\n\nYes.\n\nNow, in the sequence, when am I on each row?\n\nAt t=29: y=1, safe\n\nt=30: y=0, safe\n\nt=31: y=1, safe (since t=31>30)\n\nt=32: y=2, safe\n\nt=33: y=3, safe\n\nt=34: y=4, safe\n\nt=35: y=5, safe\n\nt=36: y=6, safe\n\nt=37: y=7, safe\n\nt=38: y=8, safe (since t=38>29, and y=8 unsafe only at t=29)\n\nt=39: y=9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nCan I start going up later? But that might take more turns.\n\nFor example, if at t=30 I stay at y=0, then I need more actions.\n\nBut not necessary.\n\nPerhaps I can go directly to y=6 or something, but from y=0, it takes multiple steps, and since all safe, no benefit.\n\nSo this should be minimal H=10.\n\nBut H is the number of turns, meaning number of actions.\n\nIn the answer, I need to output the sequence.\n\nBut in the sequence above, I have actions from turn 29 to 38.\n\nBut turn 29 is t_1, so a_{t_1}, a_{t_1+1}, ..., a_{t_1 + H-1}\n\nWith H=10, so a_{29} to a_{38}.\n\nIn the output, it should be:\n\nTurn 29: D\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 38: U\n\nBut for turns 31 to 38, all U.\n\nNow, to write it in the box.\n\nBut let's make sure about the car on y=8.\n\nAt t=38, I am on y=8, is it safe?\n\ny=8 unsafe only at t=29.\n\nt=38, Δt = t - 29 = 9, for the cars.\n\nFor y=8, first car (54,43,right,6), span at t: [43 +6 Δt, 54 +6 Δt], at Δt=9: [43+54,54+54]= [97,108], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car (6,-5,right,6), span at t: [-5 +6 Δt, 6 +6 Δt], at Δt=9: [-5+54,6+54]= [49,60], 0 not in.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 faster by going to y=6 or y=7 earlier, but since I have to go through lower rows anyway, and they are safe after t=30, no need.\n\nFor example, from y=0 at t=30, if I could jump to y=6, but I can't.\n\nSo I think H=10 is minimal.\n\nBut let's see if I can do with H=9 by a different sequence.\n\nSuppose at t=29, I do D, y=0 at t=30.\n\nThen at t=30, I do U to y=1 at t=31.\n\nBut with H=9, I need to reach at t=38.\n\nFrom t=30 y=0, with actions t=30 to t=37, 8 actions, to y_{38}, max y=8.\n\nThen not 9.\n\nIf I do multiple U per turn, but no, only one step.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nThus, minimal H=10.\n\nNow, the sequence of actions.\n\na_{29} = D\n\na_{30} = U\n\na_{31} = U\n\na_{32} = U\n\na_{33} = U\n\na_{34} = U\n\na_{35} = U\n\na_{36} = U\n\na_{37} = U\n\na_{38} = U\n\nBut a_{38} is the last action, to go from y=8 to y=9 at t=39.\n\nIn terms of the sequence, it's fine.\n\nTo write in the answer format.\n\nBut in the sequence, from a_{31} to a_{38} all U, but I need to list each turn.\n\nSince H=10, turns from t_1 to t_1+9.\n\nt_1=29, so turns 29 to 38.\n\nNow, output:\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 29: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 30: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 31: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 32: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 33: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 34: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 35: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 36: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 37: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 38: \\text{ U} }\n\nBut in the text, it should be with the turn numbers as given.\n\nIn the answer format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so since t_1=29, it should be Turn 29: D, etc.\n\nBut in the box.\n\nPerhaps I can write it compactly, but I think list all.\n\nSince most are U, but better to list.\n\nAnother thing: at t=38, I do U to go to y=9.\n\nBut is there a way to be on y=9 earlier?\n\nFor example, if I could be on y=8 at some point and go up, but with the down at start, I lose one step.\n\nWithout the down, I can't avoid the collision.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=0 and stay, but that delays.\n\nOr, another idea: since y=6 and y=7 are safe at t=30, if I could be there at t=30.\n\nBut from y=1 at t=29, I can't.\n\nUnless I start from earlier, but I start at t=29.\n\nPerhaps I can move down multiple times, but that increases H.\n\nNo benefit.\n\nSo I think H=10 is the minimum.\n\nThus, the sequence is as above.\n\nIn the sequence, after a_{29}=D, then a_{30} to a_{38} all U, but a_{30} to a_{38} is 9 actions? t=30 to 38 inclusive is 9 turns.\n\nt=30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38: 9 actions.\n\nWith a_{29}, total 10.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the list, Turn 29 to Turn 38.\n\nNow, to write in the box.\n\nBut in the car state, for y=3,4,5 there are multiple cars, but we analyzed, only unsafe at t=30.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nI think that's all.\n\nSo the minimal H is 10.\n\nThe sequence:\n\nTurn 29: D\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nTurn 33: U\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nFor the output, since t_1=29, it should be fine.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 1) at turn \\(t_1 = 29\\). The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Unsafe Times\n- **y = 1**: Unsafe only at turn \\(T = 30\\) (due to car collision at x=0).\n- **y = 2**: Unsafe only at turn \\(T = 30\\) (same car as y=1).\n- **y = 3**: Unsafe only at turn \\(T = 30\\) (due to one car covering x=0).\n- **y = 4**: Unsafe only at turn \\(T = 30\\) (same cars as y=3).\n- **y = 5**: Unsafe only at turn \\(T = 30\\) (same cars as y=3).\n- **y = 6**: Always safe (no car covers x=0 at any turn).\n- **y = 7**: Always safe (same car as y=6).\n- **y = 8**: Unsafe only at turn \\(T = 29\\) (due to one car covering x=0), safe for \\(T \\geq 30\\).\n- **y = 0 and y = 9**: Always safe (no cars).\n\nAt turn \\(T = 29\\), the player is on y=1, which is safe. However, at \\(T = 30\\), y=1 to y=5 are unsafe. From \\(T = 31\\) onwards, all rows y=1 to y=8 are safe.\n\n### Strategy\n- At \\(T = 29\\), moving up (U) or staying (S) would place the player on y=2 or y=1 at \\(T = 30\\), both unsafe. Moving down (D) to y=0 is the only safe action, avoiding collision.\n- At \\(T = 30\\), the player is on y=0 (safe). From here, moving up repeatedly to y=9 is optimal since all rows are safe for \\(T \\geq 31\\).\n- The sequence requires 10 actions (H=10) to reach y=9:\n  - Action at \\(T = 29\\): D (to y=0 at \\(T = 30\\)).\n  - Actions at \\(T = 30\\) to \\(T = 38\\): U each (reaching y=1 at \\(T = 31\\), y=2 at \\(T = 32\\), ..., y=9 at \\(T = 39\\)).\n\n### Minimal Turns\n- A path with H=8 or H=9 is impossible:\n  - H=8 requires all U actions, but at \\(T = 30\\) the player would be on y=2 (unsafe).\n  - H=9 requires 8 U and 1 S, but starting with D at \\(T = 29\\) leads to y=0 at \\(T = 30\\), and 8 actions can only reach y=8 at \\(T = 38\\), not y=9.\n- Thus, H=10 is minimal.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions from turn \\(t_1 = 29\\) to turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 29 + 10 - 1 = 38\\) is:\n\n- Turn 29: D (move down to y=0 at T=30)\n- Turn 30: U (move up to y=1 at T=31)\n- Turn 31: U (move up to y=2 at T=32)\n- Turn 32: U (move up to y=3 at T=33)\n- Turn 33: U (move up to y=4 at T=34)\n- Turn 34: U (move up to y=5 at T=35)\n- Turn 35: U (move up to y=6 at T=36)\n- Turn 36: U (move up to y=7 at T=37)\n- Turn 37: U (move up to y=8 at T=38)\n- Turn 38: U (move up to y=9 at T=39)\n\nThe player reaches (0, 9) at turn \\(T = 39\\) (after 10 actions).\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 29: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 30: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 31: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 32: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 33: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 34: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 35: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 36: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 37: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 38: \\text{ U} }",

So at turn T, I'm on row y_T, and I might move to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nThe car spans are given at turn t1=30, and I need to compute their positions at future turns based on their speed and direction.\n\nList the cars for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1 (y=1): one car: head h=-24, tail τ=11, direction left, speed s=36. Since it's left-moving, the span moves left as time increases. At turn T, span is [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] = [-24 - 36(T-30), 11 - 36(T-30)]\n\n- Freeway 2 (y=2): same as freeway 1: [-24 - 36(T-30), 11 - 36(T-30)]\n\n- Freeway 3 (y=3): three cars:\n  - First car: h=-48, τ=-59, direction right, speed 12. For right-moving, span is [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [-59 + 12(T-30), -48 + 12(T-30)]\n  - Second car: h=36, τ=25, right, speed 12: [25 + 12(T-30), 36 + 12(T-30)]\n  - Third car: h=0, τ=-11, right, speed 12: [-11 + 12(T-30), 0 + 12(T-30)] = [-11 + 12(T-30), 12(T-30)]\n\nh and τ: for the third car, h=0, τ=-11. Since it's right-moving, the head is at the right, so span from τ to h, which is from -11 to 0 at t1.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\n- Freeway 4 (y=4): same as freeway 3: three cars with same parameters.\n\n- Freeway 5 (y=5): same as freeway 3.\n\n- Freeway 6 (y=6): one car: h=60, τ=49, right, speed 6. Span: [49 + 6(T-30), 60 + 6(T-30)] for right-moving.\n\n- Freeway 7 (y=7): same as freeway 6: [49 + 6(T-30), 60 + 6(T-30)]\n\n- Freeway 8 (y=8): two cars:\n  - First: h=60, τ=49, right, speed 6: same as above [49 + 6(T-30), 60 + 6(T-30)]\n  - Second: h=12, τ=1, right, speed 6: [1 + 6(T-30), 12 + 6(T-30)]\n\nI need to reach y=9, which is not a freeway, so no cars there. I start at y=0, which is also not a freeway, so no issue at y=0 or y=9. But when I'm on y=1 to 8, I need to avoid collisions.\n\nThe goal is to be at (0,9) at some turn, so y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nI need the minimal H, so probably I want to go up as fast as possible, but I have to avoid the cars.\n\nSince I start at y=0 and need to go to y=9, I need to cross all rows from 1 to 8. But I might stay on some rows or skip some by moving up or down, but since I need to go up, down might not be useful unless to avoid something.\n\nBut in this case, since the cars are moving, I need to time my crossing so that when I'm on a row, no car is covering x=0 at that turn.\n\nThe collision is checked only at the turn when I'm on that row. For example, if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1. So I need to ensure that at each turn T when I'm on a freeway row (1-8), for that row, at that turn T, no car has 0 in its span.\n\nSince the rows are independent, I can consider for each row, when it is safe to be on it, i.e., when no car on that row has span covering 0 at that turn.\n\nThen I need to find a path from y=0 to y=9, moving up or down or stay, but since I want to minimize turns, I should minimize staying and go up as much as possible, but I have to wait if necessary.\n\nEach move, I can change y by -1,0,+1, so to go from 0 to 9, minimum moves would be 9 up moves, but I might need to stay or move down to avoid cars, which would increase H.\n\nH is the number of turns, including the actions.\n\nAt turn t1, I start at y=0, and after H actions, I should be at y=9.\n\nAfter t actions, I am at position after t actions.\n\nLet’s say at time t (turn), I am at y_t.\n\nt1 = 30, y_{30} = 0.\n\nI choose a_{30}, then y_{31} = y_{30} + Δy_{30}, and so on, until y_{30 + H} = 9? Let's see the indexing.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so actions at times t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter action at t1, I move to y_{t1+1}, no.\n\nThe player update: at turn t, I am at y_t, I choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo after action at t, I am at y_{t+1} at turn t+1.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t1, I choose a_{t1}, which determines y_{t1+1}.\n\nThen at turn t1+1, I am at y_{t1+1}, choose a_{t1+1}, which determines y_{t1+2}, and so on, until at some turn, I am at y=9.\n\nThe turn when I reach y=9 is when y_{t1 + H} = 9, I think.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nAt turn t1, position is (0, y_{t1}) = (0,0)\n\nAfter action a_{t1}, I go to y_{t1+1} at turn t1+1.\n\nSimilarly, after action a_{t1 + t} for t from 0 to H-1, I will be at y_{t1 + H} at turn t1+H.\n\nAnd I need y_{t1 + H} = 9.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" at turn t1 + H - 1? Let's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\", and \"y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nIn the task section: \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nLet me see:\n\n\"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} which minimizes H such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nSo actions from t1 to t1+H-1, and after these H actions, at turn (t1+H-1) + something? After H actions, I have moved H times.\n\nStart: at turn t1, position y_{t1} = 0\n\nAfter action a_{t1} at turn t1, I go to y_{t1+1} at turn t1+1\n\nAfter action a_{t1+1} at turn t1+1, I go to y_{t1+2} at turn t1+2\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + k} at turn t1+k, I go to y_{t1+k+1} at turn t1+k+1\n\nAfter H actions, I have executed a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, and I am at y_{t1+H} at turn t1+H.\n\nBut the condition is y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\ny_{t1 + H - 1} is the position at turn t1 + H - 1.\n\nAt turn t1 + H - 1, I am at y_{t1 + H - 1}, and I choose a_{t1 + H - 1}, which determines y_{t1 + H}.\n\nBut the goal is to have y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9, meaning at turn t1 + H - 1, I am already at (0,9), and I don't care what action I take then, but since I'm already at 9, I might just stay or something, but the position is reached at that turn.\n\nFor the sequence, I need to specify actions from t1 to t1+H-1, but for the position at turn t1+H-1, it is determined by actions up to a_{t1+H-2}, I think.\n\nLet's define the turns.\n\nLet T = t1 + t for t=0,1,2,...\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T.\n\nI choose a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T based on a_T.\n\nThe position at turn T is y_T.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for T from t1 to t1+H-1, so actions at turns t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nAfter these actions, at turn (t1+H-1), I am at y_{t1+H-1}, and I need this to be 9.\n\nThe action at t1+H-1 is chosen, but it affects y_{t1+H}, not y_{t1+H-1}. y_{t1+H-1} is the position before or at the start of turn t1+H-1.\n\nAt the beginning of turn T, I am at y_T, then I choose a_T, which determines where I go for turn T+1.\n\nSo at turn T, I am at y_T during that turn, so for collision, at turn T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, I need no car on that row covering 0 at turn T.\n\nThe position y_T is where I am during turn T.\n\nAfter choosing a_T, I move to y_{T+1} for the next turn.\n\nSo for the goal, at some turn T, y_T = 9, and I need to reach that state with minimal T - t1 or something, but H is the number of actions.\n\nH is defined as the number of turns in the sequence, from t1 to t1+H-1, so H actions, and I reach y_{t1+H-1} = 9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nThe time from start to reach is (t1+H-1) - t1 = H-1 turns later? Let's think of the number of steps.\n\nFrom turn t1 to turn t1+H-1, there are H actions taken: at t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1.\n\nThe position at turn t1+H-1 is y_{t1+H-1}, which is the result after H-1 actions? Let's index properly.\n\nSet t = 0 at t1 for simplicity.\n\nLet τ = T - t1, so at τ=0, turn t1, y=0.\n\nI choose a_0 for turn τ=0, which determines y_1 at τ=1.\n\nSimilarly, choose a_1 at τ=1, determines y_2 at τ=2, and so on.\n\nAfter k actions, I am at y_k at turn τ=k.\n\nI need to be at y_k = 9 for some k, and k should be minimized since H is such that at turn τ=H-1, y_{H-1} =9.\n\nFrom above, at τ=0, y_0 =0\n\nAfter action a_0 at τ=0, y_1 at τ=1\n\n...\nAfter action a_{m} at τ=m, y_{m+1} at τ=m+1\n\nAt turn τ, I am at y_τ.\n\nI need y_τ =9 for some τ, and the actions are from τ=0 to τ=H-1, so for τ from 0 to H-1, I choose a_τ, and at τ=H-1, I have y_{H-1} =9.\n\nThe number of actions is H, from τ=0 to H-1.\n\nThe turn when I reach y=9 is τ=H-1.\n\nThe minimal H means minimal number of actions to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince I start at y=0 at τ=0, to reach y=9, I need at least 9 up moves, so H-1 >=9, so H >=10, because at τ=H-1, y=9, so from τ=0 to τ=H-1, I have H-1 steps to move from 0 to 9.\n\nAt τ=0, y=0\n\nAt τ=1, y=y1 after one action\n\n...\nAt τ=k, y=k after k actions.\n\ny_k is the position after k actions, at turn τ=k.\n\nTo have y_k =9, k must be at least 9, with all up moves.\n\nThen H-1 =k, so k=H-1, so H-1 >=9, H>=10.\n\nWith down or stay, k could be larger.\n\nBut minimal H when no down or stay, just up, but may collide with cars.\n\nSo I need to find when it is safe to be on each row.\n\nFirst, for each freeway row, I need to find the times when it is safe to be on that row, i.e., when no car covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nSince the cars are moving, I need for each row, the set of turns T (absolute or relative) where for that T, on that row, no car has 0 in its span.\n\nThen I need to go from y=0 to y=9, with y changing by -1,0,+1 each turn, and when on row 1-8, it must be safe at that turn.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are always safe, no cars.\n\nSo the path must have for each position where 1<=y<=8 at turn T, it is safe for that row at that turn.\n\nTo minimize H, I want to reach y=9 as soon as possible, so I should go up as fast as possible, but may need to wait or detour if unsafe.\n\nFirst, let's find for each row the safe times.\n\nDefine τ = T - t1, so relative turn, with τ=0 at t1=30.\n\nFor a given row, at turn τ (absolute turn T = t1 + τ = 30 + τ), it is safe if no car on that row has 0 in its span at T.\n\nLet's do for each freeway.\n\nStart with freeway 1, y=1.\n\nCar: one car, left-moving, span at T: [h - s(T-30), τ - s(T-30)] with h=-24, τ=11, s=36\n\nSpan: [ -24 - 36(τ), 11 - 36(τ) ] since T-30=τ\n\nSet δ = τ, for simplicity.\n\nSpan at δ: [ -24 -36δ, 11 -36δ ]\n\n0 in span if -24 -36δ <= 0 <= 11 -36δ\n\nThat is, lower bound L = -24 -36δ <=0 and upper bound U=11-36δ >=0\n\nAnd since the car is present, but we need 0 not in [L,U], so either 0 < L or 0 > U.\n\n0 in [L,U] if L <=0 and U>=0.\n\nSo not in if U <0 or L >0.\n\nU <0: 11 -36δ <0 => 11 < 36δ => δ > 11/36 ≈ 0.305, so δ >=1 since integer.\n\nL >0: -24 -36δ >0? -24 -36δ >0 => -36δ >24 => δ < -24/36 = -2/3, but δ >=0, so impossible.\n\nL = -24 -36δ <=0 always since both negative.\n\nU =11-36δ, which for δ=0, U=11>0, L=-24<0, so 0 in span.\n\nδ=1, U=11-36= -25<0, L= -24-36= -60<0, U<0 so 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly for δ>1, U more negative, L more negative, so U<0, so 0 not in span.\n\nFor δ=0, U=11>0, L=-24<0, so 0 in span.\n\nFor δ>=1, U<0, so 0 not in span.\n\nThus for freeway 1, at δ=0, unsafe; for δ>=1, safe.\n\nδ=τ relative.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2, y=2: same car parameters, so exactly the same: unsafe at δ=0, safe for δ>=1.\n\nNow freeway 3, y=3: three cars.\n\nFirst car: h=-48, τ=-59, right-moving, s=12\n\nSpan at T: for right-moving, [τ + s(T-30), h + s(T-30)] = [-59 + 12δ, -48 + 12δ]\n\n0 in this span if -59 +12δ <=0 <= -48 +12δ\n\nThat is, L = -59+12δ <=0 and U= -48+12δ >=0\n\nL<=0: -59+12δ <=0 => 12δ <=59 => δ <= 59/12 ≈4.916, so δ<=4\n\nU>=0: -48+12δ >=0 => 12δ >=48 => δ>=4\n\nSo for δ=4, L= -59+48= -11<=0, U= -48+48=0>=0, so 0 in span.\n\nFor δ<4, U<0? U= -48+12δ, for δ=3, U= -48+36= -12<0, L= -59+36= -23<0, U<0 so 0 not in span? L<=0 and U>=0 only when both, but U<0 means 0 > U, so not in [L,U] since U<0.\n\nSimilarly, for δ>4, L>0? L= -59+12δ, for δ=5, L= -59+60=1>0, U= -48+60=12>0, L>0 so 0 not in span.\n\nNow, δ=4: L= -59+48= -11 <=0, U=0 >=0, so 0 in span.\n\nSo for first car, 0 in span only at δ=4.\n\nNow second car on y=3: h=36, τ=25, right, s=12\n\nSpan: [25 +12δ, 36 +12δ]\n\nL=25+12δ >0 for all δ>=0, so 0 not in span since L>0.\n\nSimilarly, third car: h=0, τ=-11, right, s=12\n\nSpan: [-11 +12δ, 0 +12δ] = [-11+12δ, 12δ]\n\n0 in span if -11+12δ <=0 <= 12δ\n\nSince 12δ >=0 for δ>=0, and -11+12δ <=0 when 12δ <=11, δ<=11/12≈0.916, so δ=0\n\nAt δ=0, L=-11<=0, U=0>=0, so 0 in span.\n\nFor δ>=1, L= -11+12δ, for δ=1, L=1>0, U=12>0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSo for freeway 3:\n\n- First car: unsafe only at δ=4\n\n- Second car: always safe, since span positive\n\n- Third car: unsafe at δ=0, safe for δ>=1\n\nNow, for the row to be unsafe, if any car has 0 in span, so at δ=0, third car has 0, so unsafe.\n\nAt δ=4, first car has 0, so unsafe.\n\nAt other δ, all cars safe? For example δ=1: first car L=-59+12=-47<0, U=-48+12=-36<0, U<0 so not in; second car L>0; third car L=1>0, U=12>0, not in. So safe.\n\nδ=2: first car L=-59+24=-35<0,U=-48+24=-24<0; second car L>0; third car L=-11+24=13>0,U=24>0; all safe.\n\nδ=3: first car L=-59+36=-23<0,U=-48+36=-12<0; others safe.\n\nδ=5: first car L=-59+60=1>0,U=12>0; others safe.\n\nSo freeway 3 unsafe at δ=0 and δ=4, safe otherwise.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 and 5 have same cars, so same as freeway 3: unsafe at δ=0 and δ=4, safe otherwise.\n\nNow freeway 6, y=6: one car, h=60, τ=49, right, s=6\n\nSpan: [49 +6δ, 60 +6δ]\n\nL=49+6δ >0 for all δ, so always safe, 0 not in span.\n\nSimilarly freeway 7, y=7: same, always safe.\n\nNow freeway 8, y=8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: same as freeway 6, h=60, τ=49, right, s=6, span [49+6δ, 60+6δ], always safe.\n\nSecond car: h=12, τ=1, right, s=6, span [1 +6δ, 12 +6δ]\n\nL=1+6δ >0 for all δ>=0, so always safe.\n\nThus for freeway 8, both cars always have positive spans, so always safe.\n\nSummary of safe times for each row (relative turn δ):\n\n- y=1: safe for δ >=1, unsafe at δ=0\n\n- y=2: safe for δ >=1, unsafe at δ=0\n\n- y=3: unsafe at δ=0 and δ=4, safe otherwise\n\n- y=4: same as y=3, unsafe at δ=0 and δ=4\n\n- y=5: same, unsafe at δ=0 and δ=4\n\n- y=6: always safe\n\n- y=7: always safe\n\n- y=8: always safe\n\ny=6,7,8 always safe, good.\n\nNow, I start at y=0 at δ=0.\n\ny=0 is safe, no freeway.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some δ, and minimize H such that at τ=H-1, y_{H-1}=9.\n\nτ from 0 to H-1.\n\nAt each step, I can move up, down, or stay.\n\nBut since I need to go up, down might not be helpful, except to avoid being on unsafe row at wrong time.\n\nNow, the unsafe times are only at δ=0 for y=1,2,3,4,5 and at δ=4 for y=3,4,5.\n\nBut y=1 and 2 are only unsafe at δ=0, safe for δ>=1.\n\ny=3,4,5 unsafe at δ=0 and δ=4.\n\ny=6,7,8 always safe.\n\nI start at δ=0, y=0.\n\nAt δ=0, if I go to y=1, it is unsafe, since y=1 unsafe at δ=0.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay at y=0, or go down, but y=0 is bottom, so I can only stay or go up, but going up to y=1 at δ=0 is unsafe.\n\ny_t is position at turn t.\n\nAt turn δ=0, I am at y=0.\n\nI choose action a_0: if I choose U, then y_{1} =1 at turn δ=1.\n\nIf I choose S, y_{1}=0 at turn δ=1.\n\nIf D, y_{1}= -1? But y must be in [0,9], so y_{t+1} = clamp(y_t + Δy, 0,9), I think, but the player update says y_{t+1} in [0,9], so if y_t=0 and D, y_{t+1}=0, similarly at y=9 and U, y_{t+1}=9.\n\nIn this case, at y=0, D or S both go to y=0.\n\nOnly U can increase y.\n\nSimilarly at y=9, only D or S decrease or stay, but here we go to 9.\n\nNow, at δ=0, y=0.\n\nIf I choose U, then at turn δ=1, I go to y=1.\n\nBut at turn δ=1, y=1, which is freeway 1, and for y=1, at δ=1, it is safe, since δ>=1.\n\nSimilarly, if I choose S, at δ=1, I am still at y=0.\n\nBut y=0 is safe.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal path with no delays: if I go up every turn, from y=0 to y=9 in 9 steps: at δ=1, y=1; δ=2, y=2; ... δ=9, y=9.\n\nBut I need to check if at each turn when on y=1 to 8, it is safe.\n\nAt δ=1, y=1: safe for y=1 since δ=1>=1.\n\nδ=2, y=2: safe, similarly.\n\nδ=3, y=3: now y=3 at δ=3.\n\nFor y=3, unsafe at δ=0 and δ=4.\n\nδ=3 is not 0 or 4, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, δ=4, y=4: if I go up, at δ=4, y=4.\n\nBut y=4 is unsafe at δ=4, since for y=4, unsafe at δ=4.\n\nProblem.\n\nIn the direct up path: suppose I start at δ=0, y=0.\n\nAction U: go to y=1 at δ=1\n\nAt δ=1, y=1, action U: go to y=2 at δ=2\n\nAt δ=2, y=2, action U: go to y=3 at δ=3\n\nAt δ=3, y=3, now action U: go to y=4 at δ=4\n\nBut at δ=4, y=4, which is unsafe because for y=4, at δ=4, it is unsafe.\n\nCollision at turn δ=4 when on y=4.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=4 at δ=4.\n\nSimilarly, I could be on y=3 or y=5 at δ=4, but in this path, at δ=4 I am on y=4.\n\nNow, at δ=3, I am on y=3, which is safe since δ=3 not 0 or 4.\n\nBut if I go up to y=4 at δ=4, unsafe.\n\nI could stay or go down, but going down to y=2 at δ=4 might be safe, but I need to go up eventually.\n\nSince y=6,7,8 are always safe, I could go faster or slower to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nThe only unsafe points are at δ=0 for y=1,2,3,4,5 and at δ=4 for y=3,4,5.\n\nδ=0 is only the start, and I start at y=0, so if I don't go to y=1 at δ=0, I avoid that.\n\nFor δ=4, I need to not be on y=3,4,5 at turn δ=4.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nMinimal H: since I need to go from 0 to 9, with 9 net up moves, and possibly some stays or downs, but downs would require more moves, so better to avoid downs.\n\nStays might be needed to wait.\n\nIn the direct path, at δ=4 I would be on y=4 if I go up all the way, but unsafe.\n\nI can be on a different row at δ=4.\n\nFor example, at δ=3, instead of going to y=4, I could stay at y=3 or go down to y=2.\n\nBut y=2 at δ=4: for y=2, it is safe at δ=4 since only unsafe at δ=0, safe for δ>=1.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down to y=2 at δ=4, safe.\n\nBut then I need to go up later.\n\nI could be on y=6 or higher at δ=4, but let's see the timing.\n\nSince y=6,7,8 are always safe, I might go faster to those rows.\n\nBut I have to pass through lower rows.\n\nList the positions over time.\n\nStart at δ=0, y=0.\n\nI need to choose actions.\n\nIf I go up immediately at δ=0, to y=1 at δ=1, but at δ=1, y=1 is safe as we said.\n\nThen I can go up to y=2 at δ=2, safe.\n\nAt δ=2, y=2, go up to y=3 at δ=3, safe.\n\nNow at δ=3, y=3, I need to avoid being on y=4 at δ=4.\n\nSo I cannot go up to y=4 at δ=4.\n\nOptions:\n\n- Stay at y=3: then at δ=4, y=3, but y=3 is unsafe at δ=4, since for y=3, unsafe at δ=4. Oh, problem.\n\nAt δ=4, if I am on y=3, it is unsafe because for y=3, at δ=4, it is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down to y=2 at δ=4, y=2 is safe at δ=4.\n\nBut y=3 at δ=4 is unsafe.\n\nSo at δ=3, if I stay, at δ=4 I am still at y=3, unsafe.\n\nIf I go down, to y=2 at δ=4, safe.\n\nIf I go up, to y=4 at δ=4, unsafe.\n\nSo the only safe choice at δ=3 from y=3 is to go down to y=2 at δ=4.\n\nThen at δ=4, y=2, which is safe.\n\nThen I need to go up from there.\n\nBut I was at y=3 at δ=3, I go down to y=2 at δ=4.\n\nThen at δ=4, y=2, I can go up to y=3 at δ=5.\n\nAt δ=5, y=3, which is safe since δ=5 not 0 or 4.\n\nThen go up to y=4 at δ=6, and so on.\n\nBut let's see the path.\n\nδ=0: y=0, action? I need to specify.\n\nFirst, at δ=0, y=0, I must choose action.\n\nIf I choose U, go to y=1 at δ=1.\n\nOr S, stay at y=0 at δ=1.\n\nIf I stay at δ=0, at δ=1 y=0, then I can go up later.\n\nBut to save time, better to go up as soon as possible, but with constraints.\n\nSince at δ=4, I need to not be on y=3,4,5, I could be on lower or higher.\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=5 or above by δ=4, but y=5 at δ=4 is also unsafe.\n\ny=5 unsafe at δ=4.\n\ny=6 is always safe, so if I can reach y=6 by δ=4.\n\nFrom y=0 at δ=0 to y=6 at δ=4.\n\nThat requires 6 up moves in 4 steps? From δ=0 to δ=4, I have 4 actions: at δ=0,1,2,3 to go to positions at δ=1,2,3,4.\n\nAt δ=0, y=0, after action at δ=0, y at δ=1.\n\nAfter action at δ=1, y at δ=2, and so on, up to after action at δ=3, y at δ=4.\n\nSo to have y at δ=4 as high as possible.\n\nStart: δ=0, y=0\n\nAfter a_0: y_1 at δ=1\n\nAfter a_1: y_2 at δ=2\n\nAfter a_2: y_3 at δ=3\n\nAfter a_3: y_4 at δ=4\n\nI need y_4 =? But I care about position at each turn.\n\nAt turn δ=4, position y_4.\n\nI want y_4 to be 6 or something.\n\nBut to go from y=0 to y=6 in 4 steps, I need 6 net up moves, but only 4 actions, so I can increase by at most 4, so y_4 <=4.\n\nAt δ=0, y=0\n\nAfter first action, y_1 <=1\n\nAfter second, y_2 <=2\n\nAfter third, y_3 <=3\n\nAfter fourth action, y_4 <=4\n\nSo at δ=4, y <=4.\n\nSimilarly, cannot be higher than 4 at δ=4.\n\nTherefore, at δ=4, y must be between 0 and 4.\n\nBut y=3 and y=4 are unsafe at δ=4 if on freeway.\n\ny=0,1,2,3,4,5 are freeways for y=1-5, but y=0 and y=5? y=0 not freeway, y=5 is freeway.\n\nAt δ=4, if y=3,4, or 5, but y<=4, so y=3 or 4 possible, both unsafe for their rows.\n\ny=2 is safe, y=1 is safe, y=0 safe.\n\nBut y=2 at δ=4 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 safe, y=0 safe.\n\nSo at δ=4, I can be on y=0,1,2 safely.\n\ny=3 and 4 unsafe.\n\nNow, in the path, I need to be on one of y=0,1,2 at δ=4 to avoid collision.\n\nThen after that, I can proceed up.\n\nNow, back to the beginning.\n\nAt δ=0, y=0.\n\nIf I go up at δ=0: to y=1 at δ=1\n\nAt δ=1, y=1, safe (since δ=1>=1)\n\nI can go up to y=2 at δ=2\n\nAt δ=2, y=2, safe\n\nNow go up to y=3 at δ=3\n\nAt δ=3, y=3, safe (δ=3 not 0 or 4)\n\nNow, at δ=3, I need to choose action such that at δ=4, I am not on y=3 or y=4.\n\nIf I go up, to y=4 at δ=4, unsafe.\n\nIf I stay, to y=3 at δ=4, unsafe.\n\nSo only choice is go down to y=2 at δ=4.\n\nThen at δ=4, y=2, safe.\n\nThen at δ=4, y=2, I can go up to y=3 at δ=5\n\nAt δ=5, y=3, which is safe since δ=5 not 0 or 4.\n\nThen go up to y=4 at δ=6\n\nAt δ=6, y=4, now for y=4, unsafe only at δ=0 and δ=4, δ=6 not those, so safe.\n\nThen go up to y=5 at δ=7\n\ny=5 at δ=7, unsafe only at δ=0 and δ=4, δ=7 safe.\n\nThen to y=6 at δ=8, y=6 always safe.\n\ny=7 at δ=9\n\ny=8 at δ=10\n\ny=9 at δ=11\n\nAt δ=11, y=9.\n\nNow, the turn: at τ=H-1 =11, y=9.\n\nτ=H-1, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nActions from τ=0 to τ=11? τ from 0 to H-1, with H actions.\n\nAt τ=H-1, y=9.\n\nIn this case, at τ=11, y=9, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nNow, the actions:\n\nStart at τ=0 (δ=0), y=0\n\nAction: U, go to y=1 at τ=1\n\nAt τ=1, y=1, action U, go to y=2 at τ=2\n\nAt τ=2, y=2, action U, go to y=3 at τ=3\n\nAt τ=3, y=3, action D, go to y=2 at τ=4  (since down)\n\nAt τ=4, y=2, action U, go to y=3 at τ=5\n\nAt τ=5, y=3, action U, go to y=4 at τ=6\n\nAt τ=6, y=4, action U, go to y=5 at τ=7\n\nAt τ=7, y=5, action U, go to y=6 at τ=8\n\nAt τ=8, y=6, action U, go to y=7 at τ=9\n\nAt τ=9, y=7, action U, go to y=8 at τ=10\n\nAt τ=10, y=8, action U, go to y=9 at τ=11\n\nYes, at τ=11, y=9.\n\nH-1=11, so H=12 actions from τ=0 to τ=11.\n\nBut τ=11 is the last action? Actions from τ=0 to τ=H-1=11, so τ=0 to 11 inclusive, that's 12 actions.\n\nAt τ=11, I choose action to go to y=9 at τ=12? No.\n\nPosition: at turn τ, y_τ.\n\nAfter action at τ, y_{τ+1}.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nAt τ=0, y=0, choose U, so y_{1} =1\n\nAt τ=1, y=1, choose U, y_{2}=2\n\n...\n\nAt τ=3, y=3, choose D, y_{4}=2\n\nAt τ=4, y=2, choose U, y_{5}=3\n\nAt τ=5, y=3, choose U, y_{6}=4\n\n...\n\nAt τ=10, y=8, choose U, y_{11}=9\n\nNow at turn τ=11, y_{11}=9, which is the goal.\n\nThe actions were chosen from τ=0 to τ=10? At τ=10, I choose U to go to y=9 at τ=11.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for τ from 0 to H-1.\n\nAt τ=H-1, I choose an action, but y_{H-1} is already set, and I need y_{H-1}=9.\n\nIn this case, at τ=10, I choose action to set y_{11}, but I need y_{τ} at τ=H-1 to be 9.\n\nHere at τ=11, y_{11}=9, so τ=H-1=11, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nActions from τ=0 to τ=11.\n\nIn the action list, at τ=0 to τ=10, I set y_{1} to y_{11}, and at τ=11, I choose an action, but since I'm already at y=9, I can choose S or something, but y_{11}=9, and I need to be at y=9 at τ=H-1=11.\n\nThe action at τ=11 determines y_{12}, but y_{12} doesn't matter, as long as at τ=11, I am at y=9.\n\nIn the action sequence, for τ=11, I can choose any action, but since y=9, if I choose U, y_{12}=9 (since can't go above), similarly D or S stay at 9.\n\nBut to minimize actions, I should not have extra actions, but since I reach at τ=11, I need to include the action at τ=11? No.\n\nThe sequence has H actions, from t=0 to H-1 relative.\n\nIn this case, to reach at τ=11, I have actions from τ=0 to τ=10 to move there, and at τ=11, I am at y=9, so the last action could be at τ=10 to arrive at τ=11.\n\nLet's count the actions in the path.\n\nI have:\n\n- At τ=0: action U, go to y1=1\n\n- τ=1: action U, go to y2=2\n\n- τ=2: action U, go to y3=3\n\n- τ=3: action D, go to y4=2\n\n- τ=4: action U, go to y5=3\n\n- τ=5: action U, go to y6=4\n\n- τ=6: action U, go to y7=5\n\n- τ=7: action U, go to y8=6\n\n- τ=8: action U, go to y9=7\n\n- τ=9: action U, go to y10=8\n\n- τ=10: action U, go to y11=9\n\nNow at τ=11, y11=9.\n\nI have actions from τ=0 to τ=10, that's 11 actions.\n\nAfter 11 actions, I am at y11 at τ=11.\n\nτ=H-1=11, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nBut I have only 11 actions listed? τ from 0 to 10 inclusive is 11 actions.\n\nτ=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10: that's 11 actions.\n\nAfter these, at τ=11, y11=9.\n\nThe position at τ=11 is after 11 actions from start.\n\nAt τ=0, before any action, y0=0.\n\nAfter first action (τ=0), y1 at τ=1\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, y_k at τ=k.\n\nAfter 11 actions, y11 at τ=11.\n\nWe need y_{H-1} at τ=H-1 to be 9.\n\nSo here τ=H-1=11, y11=9, so H-1=11, H=12.\n\nBut with 11 actions, I reached y11=9 at τ=11.\n\nThe sequence has H actions: from τ=0 to τ=H-1.\n\nFor H=12, actions from τ=0 to τ=11.\n\nAt τ=11, I need to choose an action, but since y11=9, I can choose S, for example, to stay at y=9, so y12=9, but that is after.\n\nBut the position at τ=11 is y11=9, which is fine.\n\nIn the action at τ=11, I choose S, for instance.\n\nBut in the sequence above, I have actions up to τ=10 to reach y11=9 at τ=11.\n\nThen at τ=11, I need to include an action, say S.\n\nBut since I'm already at 9, it doesn't matter.\n\nNow, in terms of the path, at τ=11, y=9, so I don't need to do anything, but I have to specify the action for turn τ=11.\n\nSimilarly, in the minimal H, with this path, I reach at τ=11 with 11 actions? Let's see the number.\n\nI used 11 actions to go from y0=0 to y11=9.\n\nThe actions: from τ=0 to τ=10: 11 actions, reach y11=9 at τ=11.\n\nThen for H, τ=H-1=11, so H=12, so I need actions from τ=0 to τ=11.\n\nAt τ=11, since y=9, I choose S, so y12=9, but we don't care.\n\nThe position at τ=11 is y11=9, which is the goal.\n\nNow, can I do better?\n\nIn this path, I had to go down at τ=3, which cost an extra move.\n\nWithout that, I might be faster.\n\nFor example, if I delay the start.\n\nAt δ=0, y=0, instead of going up, I stay or something.\n\nSuppose at δ=0, I choose S, so at δ=1, y=0.\n\nThen at δ=1, y=0, choose U, go to y=1 at δ=2.\n\nBut at δ=1, y=1 is safe, but I started later.\n\nAt δ=1, y=1; δ=2, y=2; δ=3, y=3; now at δ=3, y=3, same as before, I need to go down or something to avoid δ=4 on y=3,4,5.\n\nBut at δ=4, if I can be on y=2, for example.\n\nFrom above: at δ=3, y=3, go down to y=2 at δ=4.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nBut I started later, so it might take more turns.\n\nFor example: δ=0: S, y1=0 at δ=1\n\nδ=1: U, y2=1 at δ=2\n\nδ=2: U, y3=2 at δ=3\n\nδ=3: U, y4=3 at δ=4? But at δ=4, y=3 unsafe.\n\nAt δ=3, from y=2, if I go up to y=3 at δ=4, unsafe.\n\nSo need to stay or down.\n\nAt δ=3, y=2, I can stay: y4=2 at δ=4, safe.\n\nThen at δ=4, y=2, go up to y=3 at δ=5, etc.\n\nBut now I reach later.\n\nFor instance:\n\nδ=0: S, y1=0\n\nδ=1: U, y2=1\n\nδ=2: U, y3=2\n\nδ=3: S, y4=2  (stay at y=2)\n\nδ=4: U, y5=3\n\nδ=5: U, y6=4\n\nδ=6: U, y7=5\n\nδ=7: U, y8=6\n\nδ=8: U, y9=7\n\nδ=9: U, y10=8\n\nδ=10: U, y11=9\n\nAt τ=10, y11=9? y at τ=11.\n\nAfter action at δ=10, y11 at τ=11.\n\nτ=H-1=11, H=12 same as before.\n\nBut I have one stay at δ=3, instead of down and up.\n\nIn the first path, I had a down and up, which also took two extra actions effectively.\n\nIn first path: from δ=3 y=3 down to δ=4 y=2, then up to δ=5 y=3, so from y=3 to y=3 in two steps, whereas direct would be one step to y=4 but unsafe.\n\nSimilarly here, from y=2 at δ=3 to y=2 at δ=4 (stay), then to y=3 at δ=5.\n\nSo same delay.\n\nBut in the first path, I started earlier.\n\nIn first path, I reached y=9 at τ=11 with actions from τ=0 to 10.\n\nIn the stay version, I also reach at τ=11.\n\nBut in the stay version, I used a stay at δ=3, whereas in down version, I used a down and up.\n\nBut both result in reaching at same time.\n\nNow, can I reach earlier?\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=6 or above by δ=4, but impossible since max y at δ=4 is 4.\n\nAt δ=4, y<=4.\n\nSince y=6,7,8 safe always, but I have to go through y=3,4,5, which have restrictions.\n\nThe critical point is δ=4 for y=3,4,5.\n\nI need to be on y=0,1,2 at δ=4.\n\nIn the first path, I was on y=2 at δ=4.\n\nThen I went up to y=3 at δ=5, etc.\n\nNow, from y=2 at δ=4, to y=9.\n\ny=2 to y=9, difference 7, so at least 7 up moves, no down, so min 7 actions to go from y=2 to y=9.\n\nStarting from δ=4 y=2, after k actions, y at δ=4+k.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at δ=4, y=2\n\nAfter first action, y at δ=5, and so on.\n\nTo reach y=9 at some δ.\n\nSet m = δ - 4, so at m=0, δ=4, y=2\n\nThen after actions, at step m, y at δ=4+m.\n\nWe need y at some point =9.\n\nMin m such that y_{4+m} =9.\n\nSince from y=2 to y=9, need 7 up moves, so min m=7, at δ=4+7=11, y=9.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf I start from y=0 at δ=0, and go directly except avoid δ=4 on middle rows.\n\nBut I have to spend at least one extra turn to avoid being on y=3,4,5 at δ=4.\n\nIn the path, I used one extra turn (the down or stay).\n\nCan I be on a safe row at δ=4 with less delay?\n\nFor example, if I go faster to y=2 or something.\n\nAt δ=0, y=0, go U to y=1 at δ=1\n\nThen at δ=1, y=1, go U to y=2 at δ=2\n\nNow at δ=2, y=2, instead of going to y=3 at δ=3, I could stay at y=2 for one turn.\n\nAt δ=2, y=2, choose S, so at δ=3, y=2\n\nThen at δ=3, y=2, choose U to y=3 at δ=4? At δ=4, y=3, but y=3 unsafe at δ=4.\n\nIf at δ=3, y=2, I go to y=3 at δ=4, unsafe.\n\nSo I need to not go to y=3 at δ=4.\n\nAt δ=3, y=2, I can stay: at δ=4, y=2, safe.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nGo down to y=1, but worse.\n\nSo I think I cannot avoid spending an extra turn around δ=4.\n\nSince y=6,7,8 safe, but I can't reach them earlier.\n\nAnother idea: after δ=4, I can go faster through y=3,4,5 since only unsafe at specific times, but after δ=4, for y=3,4,5, they are safe except at δ=0 and δ=4, but δ>4, so safe.\n\nIn the path from δ=5 onwards, I can go up directly.\n\nIn the first path, from δ=5 to δ=11, I went up directly, no issue.\n\ny=5 to y=6 at δ=8? In the sequence: at δ=5 y=3, δ=6 y=4, δ=7 y=5, δ=8 y=6, etc.\n\nFrom δ=5 y=3 to δ=8 y=6, that's 3 steps for 3 levels, fine.\n\nBut I have the down at δ=3.\n\nPerhaps I can start later to avoid the δ=0 unsafe, but since I start at y=0, I don't go to y=1 at δ=0, so no issue.\n\nIn this case, with the path I have, H=12 seems necessary.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can reach earlier with different sequence.\n\nSuppose at δ=0, I go U to y=1 at δ=1\n\nδ=1, U to y=2 at δ=2\n\nδ=2, now instead of U, I stay: S, so at δ=3, y=2\n\nThen at δ=3, I can go U to y=3 at δ=4, but unsafe.\n\nSo must stay or down.\n\nIf stay at δ=3, y=2, to δ=4, y=2\n\nThen δ=4, U to y=3 at δ=5\n\nδ=5, U to y=4 at δ=6\n\n...\n\nUp to y=9 at δ=11 same.\n\nIf at δ=2, I go down? But y=2 to y=1 at δ=3, then I need to go up later, worse.\n\nSo no.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=3 earlier and leave before δ=4.\n\nFor example, at δ=0, S, stay at y=0 at δ=1\n\nBut delayed.\n\nOr at δ=0, U to y=1 at δ=1\n\nδ=1, U to y=2 at δ=2\n\nδ=2, U to y=3 at δ=3\n\nNow at δ=3, y=3, which is safe.\n\nI need to not be on y=3 at δ=4.\n\nBut I am at y=3 at δ=3, and if I go up or stay, I am on y=3 or y=4 at δ=4, unsafe.\n\nOnly down to y=2 at δ=4.\n\nNo other choice.\n\nThus, the minimal H is 12.\n\nIn the action sequence, for τ from 0 to 11.\n\nWith actions as I had.\n\nBut in the sequence, at τ=11, since y=9, I need to specify an action, but it can be S, for example.\n\nIn the output, I need to list the actions for each turn.\n\nNow, relative to t1=30.\n\nSo turns: t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nWith H=12.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 30: U  (to go to y=1 at turn 31)\n\nIn the answer, it should be for turn t.\n\nAt turn t, action a_t.\n\nIn this case:\n\nAt turn 30 (τ=0), action U\n\nTurn 31 (τ=1), action U\n\nTurn 32 (τ=2), action U\n\nTurn 33 (τ=3), action D\n\nTurn 34 (τ=4), action U\n\nTurn 35 (τ=5), action U\n\nTurn 36 (τ=6), action U\n\nTurn 37 (τ=7), action U\n\nTurn 38 (τ=8), action U\n\nTurn 39 (τ=9), action U\n\nTurn 40 (τ=10), action U\n\nNow, at turn 40 (τ=10), action U, go to y=9 at turn 41.\n\nBut at turn 41, y=9, which is τ=11.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I need to reach at turn t1 + H -1 =30 + H -1.\n\nWith H=12, 30+11=41, y at turn 41 should be 9.\n\nIn actions, I have actions from turn 30 to turn 40? That's 11 actions.\n\nTurn 30 to 40 inclusive: 11 turns.\n\nAfter action at turn 40, y at turn 41 is 9.\n\nSo I need to include action at turn 41? But at turn 41, I am at y=9, so I can choose action, say S.\n\nThe sequence must have H actions, from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nt1+H-1 =30 +12 -1=41.\n\nSo actions at turn 30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41.\n\nAt turn 41, I need to specify an action, since y=9, I can choose S.\n\nIn the position, at turn 41, y=9, which is fine.\n\nIn the earlier actions, I have up to turn 40 to reach y=9 at turn 41.\n\nThen at turn 41, action S to stay, but y remains 9.\n\nNow, to write the sequence.\n\nIn the output format, it should be like:\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1}\n\nTurn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t1+H-1.\n\nWith H=12.\n\nSo for turn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nTurn 33: D\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: S (or any, but S is fine)\n\nAt turn 40, I have action U, which from y=8 at turn 40 to y=9 at turn 41.\n\nThen at turn 41, y=9, action S, to y=9 at turn 42, but we don't care.\n\nThe position at turn 41 is y=9, which is the goal.\n\nNow, is there a way with H=11?\n\nSuppose H=11, then at τ=H-1=10, y must be 9.\n\nSo y at turn 10 relative must be 9.\n\nFrom y=0 at τ=0, to y=9 at τ=10, with 10 steps.\n\nMinimal with all up: from τ=0 to τ=10, y from 0 to 10? Positions: at τ=0, y=0; after 10 actions, at τ=10, y=10, but y max 9, so at τ=10, y<=9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at τ=10, I need exactly the right moves.\n\nBut with the constraint, at δ=4, which is τ=4, I need to not be on y=3,4,5.\n\nAt τ=4, y position.\n\nIn a direct up path: if all up, at τ=0 y=0, τ=1 y=1, τ=2 y=2, τ=3 y=3, τ=4 y=4, but y=4 at τ=4 unsafe.\n\nIf I go slower, at τ=4 y=3 or less, but to reach y=9 at τ=10, if at τ=4 y=3, then from y=3 to y=9 in 6 steps, possible with 6 up, but τ from 4 to 10 is 6 actions, y from 3 to 9, yes.\n\nBut at τ=4, if y=3, it is unsafe, since y=3 unsafe at τ=4.\n\nSimilarly, if y=4 at τ=4, unsafe.\n\nIf y=2 at τ=4, safe, then from y=2 to y=9 in 7 steps, but from τ=4 to τ=10, only 6 actions: after action at τ=4, y at τ=5; ... after action at τ=10, y at τ=11.\n\nTo have y at τ=10.\n\nAt τ=10, y must be 9.\n\nAfter action at τ=9, y at τ=10.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nAt turn τ, y_τ.\n\nAfter action at τ, y_{τ+1}.\n\nI need y_τ at τ=10 to be 9.\n\nSo after action at τ=9, y_{10} is set to 9.\n\ny_{10} depends on action at τ=9.\n\nTo have y_{10}=9, and y_{10} = y_9 + Δy_9.\n\nNow, at τ=4, y_4 must be safe if on freeway.\n\ny_4 must not be 3,4,5 because unsafe at τ=4.\n\nSo y_4 must be 0,1,2.\n\nNow, from start: at τ=0, y=0.\n\nAfter actions, y at τ=4.\n\nSince y changes slowly, y_4 <=4.\n\nAnd y_4 must be <=2 to be safe at τ=4.\n\nThen from there, to y_{10}=9.\n\ny_{10} = y_4 + net moves from τ=4 to τ=9.\n\nActions from τ=4 to τ=9, that's 5 actions: τ=4,5,6,7,8,9? Actions at τ=4,5,6,7,8,9 to set y at τ=5,6,7,8,9,10.\n\nSpecifically, action at τ=k sets y_{k+1}.\n\nTo set y_{10}, it is set by action at τ=9.\n\ny_{10} = y_9 + Δy_9.\n\nBut y_9 depends on previous.\n\nThe net from τ=4 to τ=10.\n\nAt τ=4, y_4\n\nAfter action at τ=4, y_5\n\n...\n\nAfter action at τ=9, y_{10}\n\nSo from y_4 to y_{10} in 6 steps (actions τ=4 to τ=9).\n\ny_{10} = y_4 + sum of Δy from τ=4 to τ=9.\n\nEach Δy in {-1,0,1}, so y_{10} - y_4 <= 6.\n\nSince y_{10}=9, y_4 >= 9-6=3.\n\nSimilarly, y_4 <= y_{10} + something, but since going up, y_4 <=9.\n\nBut from above, y_4 >=3 and y_4 <=2 to be safe at τ=4? Contradiction.\n\ny_4 >=3 and y_4 <=2 impossible.\n\nTherefore, cannot have y_{10}=9 with y_4 <=2 and y_4 >=3.\n\nThus impossible to reach y=9 at τ=10 with the constraint.\n\nTherefore, minimal is at τ=11, H=12.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, to write with absolute turns.\n\nt1=30\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 30: U\n\nTurn 31: U\n\nTurn 32: U\n\nTurn 33: D\n\nTurn 34: U\n\nTurn 35: U\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: S\n\nIn the output, it should be in the box.\n\nBut let's confirm the car at freeway 8, but since always safe, no issue.\n\nAnd I didn't go to y=9 earlier.\n\nAnother thing: at the end, when I go to y=9, it is not a freeway, so no car.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 40, y=8, I go up to y=9 at turn 41.\n\nThen at turn 41, I am at y=9, and I choose S.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn \\(t_1 = 30\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined. The minimal \\(H\\) is 12, meaning the player reaches (0, 9) at turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 30 + 11 = 41\\).\n\nThe sequence avoids collisions as follows:\n- At turns when the player is on a freeway row (y = 1 to 8), no car covers x = 0 at that turn.\n- Freeways y = 1 and y = 2 are unsafe only at relative turn \\(\\delta = 0\\) (absolute turn 30), but the player is not on these rows at \\(\\delta = 0\\).\n- Freeways y = 3, y = 4, and y = 5 are unsafe at \\(\\delta = 0\\) and \\(\\delta = 4\\) (absolute turns 30 and 34). The player avoids being on these rows at \\(\\delta = 4\\) by being on y = 2 at turn 34.\n- Freeways y = 6, y = 7, and y = 8 are always safe, so no restrictions apply when on these rows.\n\nThe action sequence ensures the player moves up efficiently, with one down move (at turn 33) to avoid being on an unsafe row at turn 34, and one stay move (at turn 41) after reaching y = 9.\n\n**Action Sequence (minimal H = 12):**\n\n- Turn 30: U (moves to y = 1 at turn 31; safe as y = 1 is safe for \\(\\delta \\geq 1\\))\n- Turn 31: U (moves to y = 2 at turn 32; safe as y = 2 is safe for \\(\\delta \\geq 1\\))\n- Turn 32: U (moves to y = 3 at turn 33; safe as y = 3 is safe at \\(\\delta = 3\\))\n- Turn 33: D (moves to y = 2 at turn 34; avoids being on y = 3 or y = 4 at \\(\\delta = 4\\), and y = 2 is safe at \\(\\delta = 4\\))\n- Turn 34: U (moves to y = 3 at turn 35; safe as y = 3 is safe for \\(\\delta \\neq 0, 4\\))\n- Turn 35: U (moves to y = 4 at turn 36; safe as y = 4 is safe for \\(\\delta \\neq 0, 4\\))\n- Turn 36: U (moves to y = 5 at turn 37; safe as y = 5 is safe for \\(\\delta \\neq 0, 4\\))\n- Turn 37: U (moves to y = 6 at turn 38; safe as y = 6 is always safe)\n- Turn 38: U (moves to y = 7 at turn 39; safe as y = 7 is always safe)\n- Turn 39: U (moves to y = 8 at turn 40; safe as y = 8 is always safe)\n- Turn 40: U (moves to y = 9 at turn 41; y = 9 has no cars)\n- Turn 41: S (stays at y = 9; no action needed but included to complete the sequence)\n\nAt turn 41, the player is at (0, 9), satisfying the goal. No sequence with H < 12 is possible due to the need to avoid the unsafe state at \\(\\delta = 4\\) on rows y = 3, 4, or 5.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn 30: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn 31: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn 32: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn 33: } D \\\\ \\text{Turn 34: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn 35: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn 36: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn 37: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn 38: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn 39: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn 40: } U \\\\ \\text{Turn 41: } S \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 31, and the player is at (0,1). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions.\n\nThe player can move up (U: y+1), down (D: y-1), or stay (S: y unchanged). Note that the grid has y in [0,9]. We start at y=1 and want to get to y=9.\n\nThe cars are on freeways y=1 to y=8 (each row is a freeway). We must avoid being on a freeway at a turn T if there is a car on that freeway at T such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the car's span at that turn.\n\nImportant: At turn T, if we move to a different freeway, we are only considered to be on the freeway of the starting y at that turn. So when we move from y to y' at turn T, at that exact turn T we are on y (so we only check the cars on freeway y at turn T). Then at turn T+1, we are on y'.\n\nWe are going to simulate the movement and check for collisions.\n\nWe are given the state at turn t1=31. The cars are defined at turn t1, and we can compute their positions at any future turn T by:\n  For a left-moving car: Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n  For a right-moving car: Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nNote: The description for right-moving car says:\n  Initially: Span(t1) = [tau, h] (so head is h, tail is tau, and h > tau because it's moving right? Actually, the representation in the table might be given as (head, tail, direction, speed). Let me clarify:\n\nIn the table for freeway 3, we have: (-36, -47, right, 12). But note that -36 > -47, so if it's moving right, the head should be the rightmost? But here the head is -36 and tail is -47? That would imply that the car is from -47 to -36? Then moving right: at turn T, the car would be at [ -47 + s*(T-31), -36 + s*(T-31) ].\n\nSimilarly, for a left-moving car: (head, tail) = (-60, -25) for freeway 1: so the car is from -60 to -25? Then moving left: [ -60 - s*(T-31), -25 - s*(T-31) ].\n\nBut note: the description says for left-moving: Span(t1)=[h, tau] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. So if at t1 the car is [h, tau] and h is the head (so h>tau for left-moving? Actually, for a left-moving car, the head is the leftmost? That might be the case. But in the given data, for freeway 1: head=-60, tail=-25. Since the car is moving left, the head (front) is at -60 and tail at -25? That would be a car of length 35, and moving left, the entire car moves left.\n\nSimilarly, for a right-moving car: head is the front (rightmost) and tail is the leftmost? But in the data for freeway 3: one car is (-36, -47, right, 12). Here head=-36, tail=-47. Since -36 > -47, that makes sense: the car extends from -47 (tail) to -36 (head). When moving right, the head becomes -36 + s*(T-31) and the tail becomes -47 + s*(T-31).\n\nSo to summarize:\n  For a car (h, tau, d, s) at turn t1:\n    If d == 'left': the car at turn T is [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)] (and note that h < tau? Actually, in the example for freeway1: h=-60, tau=-25, so h<tau. Then the car at T is [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)] and since h<tau, we have h - s*(T-t1) < tau - s*(T-t1). So the car spans from h - s*(T-t1) to tau - s*(T-t1). But wait, that would be a negative length? Actually, the car should have positive length. \n\nLet me check the example: freeway1: h=-60, tau=-25 -> the length is (-25) - (-60) = 35, so positive. So the representation is: the car is from h (the leftmost) to tau (the rightmost) for a left-moving car? But then moving left, both endpoints decrease. Similarly, for right-moving: the car is from tau (leftmost) to h (rightmost) and moving right, both increase.\n\nBut the problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, tau]\" and then becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. So if h and tau are given such that h<tau, then the interval [h, tau] becomes [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt]. Similarly, for right-moving: \"Span(t1)=[tau, h]\" becomes [tau + s*dt, h + s*dt]? But note: in the right-moving example, the table gives (head, tail) as (h, tau) = (-36, -47). Then according to the rule, the initial span is [tau, h] = [-47, -36]. Then at T: [ -47 + s*(T-t1), -36 + s*(T-t1) ].\n\nSo the representation in the table for a car is (head, tail, direction, speed) where:\n  - For left-moving: head is the leftmost, tail is the rightmost? But that doesn't match because then the car is from head to tail (head <= tail) and moving left, both decrease.\n  - For right-moving: head is the rightmost, tail is the leftmost? Then the car is from tail to head (tail <= head) and moving right, both increase.\n\nIn the data for freeway 3, we have three cars: \n  (-36, -47, right, 12): so tail=-47, head=-36 -> car from -47 to -36 (length 11)\n  (48, 37, right, 12): tail=37, head=48 -> car from 37 to 48 (length 11) -> but wait, 37 to 48 is 11, but the head is 48 and tail is 37? Then the car is [37,48]. But the problem says for right-moving: the initial span is [tau, head] -> [37,48]. Then at T: [37+12*(T-31), 48+12*(T-31)].\n  (12, 1, right, 12): tail=1, head=12 -> car [1,12].\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 8: \n  (-48, -59, right, 6): tail=-59, head=-48 -> car from -59 to -48 (length 11)\n  (18,7,right,6): tail=7, head=18 -> car from 7 to 18 (length 11)\n\nNow, collision condition: at turn T, if we are on freeway y (which must be between 1 and 8) and if there is a car on freeway y at T such that 0 is in [left_end, right_end] of the car? Note: the car spans an interval, and we are at x=0.\n\nBut note: the car spans are given as [a, b] where a is the left end and b the right end? \n  For left-moving: the car at T is [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt] and since h<=tau, then h-s*dt <= tau-s*dt, so the interval is from h-s*dt to tau-s*dt. So we need 0 in [h-s*dt, tau-s*dt].\n  For right-moving: the car at T is [tau+s*dt, head+s*dt] and tau<=head, so the interval is from tau+s*dt to head+s*dt. So we need 0 in [tau+s*dt, head+s*dt].\n\nWe are at turn 31, and we are at y=1. We need to move to y=9. The minimal number of moves without any cars would be 8 moves (each U) to go from 1 to 9. But we must avoid the cars.\n\nWe are going to consider a BFS in the state (turn, y) but note that the turn can be large and the y is only 10 states. However, the cars move over time, so we have to compute the car positions at each turn. But note that the cars move linearly and the grid is periodic? Actually, no, the cars just move infinitely. But we are only concerned with when they cover x=0.\n\nWe can precompute for each freeway (y=1 to 8) and for each car on that freeway, the time intervals (if any) during which the car covers x=0.\n\nBut note: we are at turn 31, and we are planning for future turns T>=31.\n\nLet me define dt = T - 31.\n\nFor a car on freeway k (which is a fixed freeway) with parameters (h, tau, d, s):\n\nCase 1: left-moving (d='left')\n  The car covers 0 at T if:\n      h - s*dt <= 0 <= tau - s*dt\n  => h <= s*dt <= tau   [by rearranging: 0>=h-s*dt => s*dt>=h, and 0<=tau-s*dt => s*dt<=tau]\n  But note: h and tau are fixed. Since the car is moving left, the condition is that at T, the car must be covering 0.\n\n  Actually, rearranging:\n      h - s*dt <= 0  => s*dt >= h\n      tau - s*dt >= 0  => s*dt <= tau\n\n  But note: h and tau are negative? In our example for freeway1: h=-60, tau=-25. Then:\n      s*dt >= -60 and s*dt <= -25 -> but s*dt is nonnegative? (dt>=0, s>0) -> then s*dt>=0, so 0>= -60 (always true) and 0<=-25? false. So this car never covers 0? \n\n  Actually, let me check: \n      The car is at [ -60 -36*dt, -25 -36*dt ]. We need:\n          -60 -36*dt <= 0 <= -25 -36*dt\n      The second inequality: 0 <= -25 -36*dt -> which is always false because -25 -36*dt is negative. So indeed, this car never covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway2 is the same.\n\nNow freeway3: \n  Car1: (-36,-47,right,12): \n      Condition: 0 in [ -47 + 12*dt, -36 + 12*dt ]\n      => -47 + 12*dt <= 0 <= -36 + 12*dt\n      => 12*dt <= 47 and 12*dt >= 36\n      => 36 <= 12*dt <= 47\n      => 3 <= dt <= 3.916... -> so only at dt=3? (since dt integer) -> at dt=3: \n          lower = -47+36 = -11, upper = -36+36=0 -> then 0 is in [-11,0]? yes, because 0 is the upper bound? The interval is inclusive? The problem says \"0 in Span(T)\", so if the span is [a,b] then 0 is in if a<=0<=b.\n\n      At dt=3: T=31+3=34, the car is at [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0]. So 0 is included.\n\n      At dt=4: [-47+48, -36+48] = [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n\n  So at T=34, freeway3 is dangerous because of this car.\n\n  Car2: (48,37,right,12): \n      Condition: 0 in [37+12*dt, 48+12*dt] -> \n          37+12*dt <= 0 <= 48+12*dt -> but 37+12*dt>=37>0, so no solution.\n\n  Car3: (12,1,right,12): \n      Condition: 0 in [1+12*dt, 12+12*dt] -> again, 1+12*dt>=1>0, so no solution.\n\nSo freeway3 has a dangerous car only at T=34 (dt=3).\n\nSimilarly, freeway4 and 5 have the same cars? So same as freeway3: only dangerous at T=34.\n\nFreeway6: (-48,-59,right,6) -> \n  Condition: 0 in [-59+6*dt, -48+6*dt]\n  => -59+6*dt <= 0 <= -48+6*dt\n  => 6*dt <= 59 and 6*dt>=48\n  => 48<=6*dt<=59 -> 8<=dt<=9.83 -> dt=8,9\n      dt=8: [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0] -> 0 included.\n      dt=9: [-59+54, -48+54] = [-5,6] -> 0 included? -5<=0<=6 -> yes.\n\n  So freeway6 is dangerous at T=31+8=39 and T=31+9=40.\n\nFreeway7: same car as freeway6? Then dangerous at T=39,40.\n\nFreeway8: \n  Car1: (-48,-59,right,6): same as above -> dangerous at T=39,40.\n  Car2: (18,7,right,6): \n        Condition: 0 in [7+6*dt, 18+6*dt] -> all positive, so no solution.\n\nSo freeway8 dangerous at T=39,40.\n\nNow, we also note that freeway1,2: no danger at any time.\n\nBut wait, what about freeway1: the car is moving left: [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt] = [-60-36*dt, -25-36*dt]. We need:\n    -60-36*dt <= 0 <= -25-36*dt\nThe second inequality: 0 <= -25-36*dt -> false for all dt>=0. So safe.\n\nSimilarly freeway2: same.\n\nSo summary of dangerous times for each freeway:\n\nFreeway1: never\nFreeway2: never\nFreeway3: at T=34 (only)\nFreeway4: at T=34\nFreeway5: at T=34\nFreeway6: at T=39,40\nFreeway7: at T=39,40\nFreeway8: at T=39,40\n\nNow, we are at turn 31, at y=1. We want to get to y=9. We cannot be on freeways 3,4,5 at turn 34, and freeways 6,7,8 at turns 39 and 40.\n\nWe start at y=1 at turn 31.\n\nWe must plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) to go from y=1 to y=9, avoiding:\n\n- Being on freeway 3,4, or 5 at turn 34 (exactly T=34)\n- Being on freeway 6,7, or 8 at turns 39 and 40.\n\nNote: We are not required to avoid these freeways at other times? Because the dangerous events are only at these specific turns.\n\nBut note: we must also avoid any other collisions? The above are the only times when a car covers 0? Yes, because we computed the time intervals when each freeway has a car covering 0.\n\nNow, the minimal moves would be 8 moves (all U). But we must avoid the dangerous configurations.\n\nLet's see the timeline for the minimal path:\n\nTurn 31: at y=1 -> then we are at freeway1 at turn31: safe (freeway1 is safe always). Then we choose an action.\n\nWe want to be at y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nOption 1: Go straight up.\n\nTurn 31: start at y=1.\n  Turn31: action U -> y=2 at turn32.\n  Turn32: action U -> y=3 at turn33.\n  Turn33: action U -> y=4 at turn34. -> but at turn34, we are at freeway4 -> which is dangerous at T=34 -> collision.\n\nSo we must avoid being on freeways 3,4,5 at turn34.\n\nWe need to be at a freeway not in {3,4,5} at turn34. The safe freeways at turn34 are 1,2,6,7,8, and also note that we can be at y=0 or y=9 (which are not freeways? but the freeways are from 1 to 8). The problem says: avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8. So if we are at y=0 or y=9, there are no cars? So safe.\n\nBut note: the player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t, and y_t in [0,9]. So we can be at y=0 or y=9.\n\nAt turn34, we must not be at freeway3,4,5. So we can be at y=0,1,2,6,7,8,9.\n\nSimilarly, at turns39 and40, we must not be at freeway6,7,8 -> so we must be at y=0,1,2,3,4,5,9.\n\nNow, we start at y=1 at turn31. We have 3 turns to get to turn34: turns 31,32,33 (actions) and then at turn34 we are at the position after the last action.\n\nLet me denote the state at the beginning of turn T: we are at y_T. Then we choose an action a_T, and then at turn T+1 we are at y_{T+1} = y_T + Delta.\n\nSo at turn31: we are at y=1. Then we choose a_31 -> then at turn32 we are at y32 = y31 + Delta31.\n\nSimilarly, at turn32: choose a32 -> y33 = y32 + Delta32.\nAt turn33: choose a33 -> y34 = y33 + Delta33.\n\nWe require that at turn34, we are at a safe freeway: y34 not in {3,4,5}. So y34 in {0,1,2,6,7,8,9}.\n\nSimilarly, we must avoid being at freeways6,7,8 at turn39 and turn40.\n\nNow, we also want to get to y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nWe have 3 moves to get to turn34. We start at y=1. We can move up, down, or stay.\n\nWe need to consider the state (turn, y) and the actions.\n\nWe'll do a BFS over the turns, but note that the dangerous events are at fixed turns (34,39,40) and beyond that we can move freely? Actually, beyond turn40, we don't have any dangerous events? Because the dangerous events we computed are only at 34,39,40. But note: are there any other cars that might cover 0 at other times? We computed for all the given cars, and the only times when any freeway has a car covering 0 are at 34 (freeways3,4,5) and 39,40 (freeways6,7,8). So beyond turn40, we are safe.\n\nSo the constraints are only at turns 34, 39, and 40.\n\nWe need to plan a path that:\n  - At turn34: y34 not in {3,4,5}\n  - At turn39: y39 not in {6,7,8}\n  - At turn40: y40 not in {6,7,8}\n\nAnd we start at turn31: y31=1, and we want to get to y=9 as fast as possible.\n\nWe can simulate from turn31 to turn40 and then beyond.\n\nBut note: we can get to y=9 earlier than turn40? But we have to avoid the constraints at turn39 and 40 if we are still below 9.\n\nWe'll do a BFS in the state (turn, y) for turns from 31 up to, say, 50 (but we hope to finish by 40 or so).\n\nStates: (T, y) for T starting at 31, and y in {0,1,...,9}. We start at (31,1). Goal: (T,9) for any T.\n\nWe want the minimal T such that we can reach (T,9) without violating the constraints at the dangerous turns.\n\nWe'll simulate the next states:\n\nFrom (T, y), we can go to (T+1, y') where y' = y + { -1,0,1 } (if within [0,9]).\n\nBut we must check: when we are at state (T, y), we are about to choose an action for turn T. Then we move to (T+1, y') and we are at y' at turn T+1.\n\nBut note: the collision condition is: at turn T, we are at y (the freeway) and we check if there is a car on freeway y at turn T. But we precomputed that the only dangerous turns are 34,39,40 and only for specific freeways. So:\n\n  For T not in {34,39,40}, we are safe on any freeway? Because we computed that no car covers 0 at any other turn? Yes.\n\n  For T in {34,39,40}:\n      if T=34 and y in {3,4,5} -> collision.\n      if T=39 or 40 and y in {6,7,8} -> collision.\n\nSo we can only be at (34, y) if y not in {3,4,5}; similarly for (39,y) and (40,y) must avoid y in {6,7,8}.\n\nWe can do a BFS:\n\nLet dist[T][y] = minimal number of turns from the start (turn31) to reach (T,y). But we are at turn31 at the beginning, so we start at (31,1) with 0 actions taken? Actually, we are going to take actions at turn31, turn32, etc.\n\nWe want to find the minimal T such that we can be at (T,9) without violating the constraints at any of the dangerous turns.\n\nWe start at (31,1). Then we take an action at turn31 -> leads to (32, y32). Then at turn32 we take an action -> (33,y33) -> (34,y34) and so on.\n\nWe must ensure that at every state (T,y) we are safe: meaning that if T is a dangerous turn (34,39,40) then y must not be in the forbidden set for that turn.\n\nWe'll do a BFS starting from (31,1) and consider the next states.\n\nWe'll use a queue: (T, y, actions_so_far) but we don't need to store the whole sequence, we can store the parent pointers? Or we can store the action taken at each step.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the minimal steps to reach (T,9) and then reconstruct the path.\n\nBut note: we want the minimal H (number of turns) such that we are at (t1+H-1, 9). Actually, at turn t1+H-1 we are at y=9. How do we count? \n\nWe start at turn31 (which is the current turn, we haven't taken any action yet). Then we take H actions: at turn31,32,...,31+H-1. Then at the end of turn31+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nSo the state at the beginning of turn31: (31,1). Then we take an action at turn31 -> at the beginning of turn32 we are at y32. Then ... until at the beginning of turn31+H we are at y=9? Actually, we want at the beginning of turn31+H we are at y=9? But note: we take H actions: the last action is at turn31+H-1, which moves us to y at turn31+H. So we are at (31+H,9).\n\nSo we want the minimal H such that we can be at (31+H,9) without having violated any constraint at the intermediate turns.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n  For T from 31 to ... (until we reach 9) and for each y, we compute the minimal steps (or the minimal T) to reach (T,y) without violating the constraints at the dangerous turns.\n\nWe'll do a BFS:\n\n  Let Q be a queue, initially: (31,1,0) meaning at turn31 we are at y=1, and we have taken 0 actions so far? But we haven't taken any action at turn31 yet.\n\nActually, at the start of turn31, we are at (31,1). Then we choose an action. So we are going to generate the next states: (32, y') for y' in {0,1,2} (if we move down, stay, up) but we cannot go below 0: so from y=1, we can go to 0 (D), 1 (S), 2 (U).\n\nBut note: we must check the state at the current turn? Actually, at turn31, we are at y=1 -> which is freeway1. And freeway1 is safe at turn31 (because dangerous events only at 34,39,40). So safe.\n\nThen at turn32, we are at y=0,1, or 2. Then we choose an action at turn32, and so on.\n\nWe'll do:\n\n  dist[T][y] = the minimal number of actions taken to reach (T,y) from (31,1). Or we can store the T (which is 31 + (number of actions taken)).\n\nWe'll use a 2D array: visited[T][y] = whether we have visited (T,y) and we store the previous state and action.\n\nBut T can be large? But we hope to get to 9 in about 8-12 moves. So we can set a limit, say T up to 31+20 = 51.\n\nWe want to minimize T (the turn when we first reach y=9) and then H = T - 31 (because we are at the beginning of turn T, and we have taken T-31 actions? Actually, we have taken T-31 actions: at turn31,32,...,T-1. Then at turn T we are at y=9. So the number of turns (actions) is H = T-31.\n\nWe want minimal H, so minimal T.\n\nAlgorithm:\n\n  Initialize: \n      dist[31][1] = 0, and we set parent[31][1] = None.\n\n  For T from 31 to a limit (say 50):\n      For each y in [0,9]:\n          If we have reached (T,y) and we haven't processed it, then we consider the three actions.\n\n  But actually, we do:\n\n      For T from 31 to 50:\n          For each y in 0..9:\n              If we have a state (T,y) (i.e., we are at the beginning of turn T at y) then we can take an action that will lead to (T+1, y') where y' = y-1 (if y>0), y, y+1 (if y<9). But we must check the safety at turn T: because at turn T we are at freeway y (if y in [1,8]) and we are about to move? Actually, the collision condition is that at the beginning of turn T we are at (T,y) and we are on freeway y (if y in [1,8]) and we check if T is a dangerous turn and if y is in the forbidden set for T. If so, then we cannot be at (T,y) -> so we skip.\n\n  But note: the state (T,y) means at the beginning of turn T we are at y. Then we are going to take an action. But the collision condition for being on freeway y at turn T is already checked at the beginning? Yes. So if (T,y) is a dangerous state (for example, T=34 and y=4), then we cannot be in that state. Therefore, we must not generate that state.\n\n  Therefore, when we generate a state (T,y), we must check if it is safe: if T is in {34,39,40} and if y is in the forbidden set for T, then we skip.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      Let T_min = 31, T_max = 50 (or until we reach (T,9))\n\n      We start with (31,1) -> safe? Because T=31 not in {34,39,40} -> safe.\n\n      Then for each state (T,y) that is safe and not visited, we mark it as visited and then consider the next actions.\n\n      Then for each action a in {U, D, S}:\n          y_next = \n              if a=U: y+1 (if y<9)\n              if a=D: y-1 (if y>0)\n              if a=S: y\n          Then we get (T+1, y_next). But note: we must check the safety at the new state (T+1, y_next) only if we are going to be in that state? Actually, we check when we generate (T+1, y_next): at the beginning of turn T+1, we are at y_next. Then we check: if T+1 is in {34,39,40} and y_next in the forbidden set -> then we skip.\n\n      We do not check the state at turn T again? Because we already ensured that (T,y) is safe when we processed it.\n\n      However, note: the move: when we are at (T,y) and we choose an action, we are at freeway y during turn T. But we already ensured that (T,y) is safe? Yes, because we checked at the beginning. So the action doesn't cause a collision at turn T? Actually, the collision condition only depends on being at freeway y at turn T. So if (T,y) is safe, then we are safe at turn T.\n\n      Then after the action, we move to (T+1, y_next). Then at turn T+1, we are at y_next, so we must check safety at (T+1, y_next).\n\n      Therefore, we generate (T+1, y_next) and then check if it is safe? Or we can check when we are about to push it: if (T+1, y_next) is safe (i.e., if T+1 is a dangerous turn and y_next is in the forbidden set, then we skip).\n\n      But note: if y_next is 0 or 9, then it's safe (no freeway). If y_next in [1,8], then we check the dangerous turn condition.\n\n      We want to minimize the turn when we reach y=9.\n\n      We do:\n\n          Let Q be a queue.\n          Q.push( (31,1, []) )   # state: (T,y) and the list of actions so far? Or we can store the path? But we care about minimal H, so we can store the actions.\n\n          We'll use a visited set: visited[T][y] to avoid revisiting the same state with a higher or equal T? But we want minimal T, so if we have visited (T,y) with a T that is less than or equal, then we skip? Actually, we are doing BFS by T, so we can do:\n\n          We do a BFS by increasing T. So we consider T from 31, then 32, etc. So if we have visited (T,y) at a previous step, we skip.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            Initialize:\n                dist = 2D array (for T in [31..50] and y in [0..9]) with -1 (unvisited) or a big number.\n                dist[31][1] = 0\n\n                We'll use a queue: (T, y, actions) where actions is the list of actions taken so far (from turn31 to turn T-1). Actually, the actions taken are for turn31 to T-1, and we are now at the beginning of turn T.\n\n            Then we process each T in increasing order.\n\n            For each state (T,y) that is unvisited and safe (if T in {34,39,40} then y must be safe) and we mark it visited.\n\n            Then for each action a in {U,D,S}:\n                y_next = ... as above (if valid)\n                T_next = T+1\n                If y_next is not in [0,9], skip? But we have checks.\n\n                Then we check: if T_next is a dangerous turn and y_next is in the forbidden set for T_next, then skip (because we cannot be at (T_next, y_next)).\n                Else, if we haven't visited (T_next, y_next) or we found a shorter path, then we update.\n\n            But note: we want to minimize T when we reach y=9. So if we reach (T,9) for the first time, that's the minimal T.\n\n            However, we are doing BFS by T, so the first time we reach y=9 is minimal.\n\nImplementation:\n\n  We'll use a queue that is ordered by T.\n\n  Let Q = deque()\n  Q.append( (31, 1, []) )   # at turn31, y=1, no actions taken yet (but we are about to take the first action at turn31)\n\n  Then while Q:\n        pop state (T, y, path)\n        if y == 9: then we are done: the answer is H = len(path) and the path.\n\n        But note: at state (T,y), we are at the beginning of turn T. We have taken the actions for turns 31 to T-1 (so the path has length T-31). Then we are about to take the next action at turn T? Actually, no: the path we stored is the actions taken from turn31 to T-1. Then we are at (T,y). Then we need to take an action at turn T to go to T+1.\n\n        But we haven't taken the action at turn T yet. So we need to consider the actions at turn T.\n\n        Then for each action a in {U, D, S}:\n            y_next = y + delta(a)\n            T_next = T+1\n            If y_next not in [0,9]: skip.\n\n            Check if the state (T_next, y_next) is safe: \n                if T_next in {34,39,40} and y_next in the forbidden set for T_next -> skip.\n                else: \n                    If we haven't visited (T_next, y_next) (by BFS we will first visit with minimal T), then we mark and push.\n\n        We push (T_next, y_next, path + [a]) \n\n  But note: we must avoid infinite loops? But we have a bound on T (up to 50) and y is bounded.\n\n  We must mark visited states: but note, we might reach the same y at the same T by different paths? Then we can skip if we have visited (T,y) already? Because the path to (T,y) with the same T doesn't matter for the future? Actually, if we have reached (T,y) by a shorter path (in terms of actions) but we are storing the entire path and we are doing BFS by T (which is increasing), then the first time we reach (T,y) we have the minimal T. But note: we might have multiple paths to the same (T,y). So we can mark visited for (T,y).\n\n  So we do:\n\n      visited = 2D array for T in [31..50] and y in [0..9] -> boolean.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      Initialize visited as False.\n\n      Set visited[31][1]=True.\n\n      Q = deque([ (31,1, []) ])\n\n      While Q:\n          (T,y,path) = Q.popleft()\n          if y==9: then output the path and break.\n\n          For each action in ['U','D','S']:\n              if action=='U' and y<9: new_y = y+1\n              if action=='D' and y>0: new_y = y-1\n              if action=='S': new_y = y\n\n              If the move is valid (new_y in [0,9]), then:\n                  new_T = T+1\n                  If new_T > 50: skip (or break if we haven't found a solution by then, but we hope not)\n\n                  Check if the state (new_T, new_y) is safe: \n                      If new_T in {34,39,40}:\n                          if new_T==34 and new_y in {3,4,5}: unsafe -> skip\n                          if new_T==39 and new_y in {6,7,8}: unsafe -> skip\n                          if new_T==40 and new_y in {6,7,8}: unsafe -> skip\n                          else: safe\n                      Else: safe\n\n                  If safe and not visited[new_T][new_y]:\n                      visited[new_T][new_y] = True\n                      new_path = path + [action]   # this action is for turn T\n                      Q.append( (new_T, new_y, new_path) )\n\n          End for\n\n      If we break on y==9, then we output the path.\n\nBut note: the path we stored is the actions for turn31, turn32, ... up to turn T (the last action is for turn T, which leads to new_T = T+1 and we are at new_y at the beginning of turn T+1). And when we are at (T+1,9) we break.\n\nThen the sequence of actions: for turn31: the first action in new_path, turn32: second, etc.\n\nBut note: the path we built: when we are at (T,y,path), then we take an action at turn T to go to (T+1, new_y). So the path includes the actions for turn31 to turn T (if we are at state (T+1, new_y) then we have taken actions for turns31 to T).\n\nIn our goal: we are at (T+1,9) -> so we have taken T+1-31 = T-30 actions? Actually, we started at turn31 and we took an action at turn31, then turn32, ... up to turn T. So that's T - 30 actions? \n\nBut note: we start at turn31 (state at the beginning) and then we take an action at turn31 -> then we are at turn32. Then ... at turn T we take an action and then we are at turn T+1. So the number of actions is (T+1) - 31? Yes: from turn31 to turn T (inclusive) is T - 31 + 1 = T - 30.\n\nBut in the state (T+1,9), we have taken T - 30 actions? Yes.\n\nBut the problem asks for the minimal H and the sequence of actions: H is the number of actions, and the sequence is from a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}. Here t1=31, so we want a_31, a_32, ..., a_{31+H-1}. And H = number of actions = T - 30 (since we are at turn T+1 after T-30 actions).\n\nAlternatively, we can store the action for each turn.\n\nBut in our BFS, the path we built is exactly the list of actions from turn31 to turn T (in order). And the length of the path is T - 30? Because we started at turn31 and we took an action at turn31, then at turn32, ... at turn T (so T-30 actions). Then we are at (T+1,9). So H = T - 30.\n\nBut note: we break when we are at (T+1,9). Then the actions we have stored are for turn31 to turn T. So we have H = T - 30 actions.\n\nWe want to minimize H? But we are doing BFS by T (increasing), so the first time we reach (T,9) for any T we break, and that T is minimal.\n\nBut note: we are actually breaking at (T+1,9). So we break when we are at turn T+1 and y=9. Then the number of actions is (T+1-31) = T - 30? Actually, from turn31 to turn T: that's T-31+1 = T-30? But we took an action at turn31, turn32,...,turnT -> that's T-30 actions? Then we are at turn T+1. \n\nBut the problem says: we are at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? Actually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" such that after taking these actions we are at (0,9). \n\nBut note: after taking the last action (a_{t1+H-1}) we are at the next turn: turn t1+H. So at turn t1+H we are at (0,9). \n\nIn our simulation: \n   We start at turn t1=31 at (0,1). \n   Then we take an action at turn31: a_{31} -> at turn32 we are at y32.\n   ... \n   We take an action at turn31+H-1: a_{31+H-1} -> at turn31+H we are at y=9.\n\nSo we break at state (31+H,9). Then H = (31+H) - 31? = H. So the number of actions is H, and we are at turn31+H.\n\nIn our BFS, we break at state (T,9) for T = 31+H. So the number of actions is H = T - 31.\n\nBut in the BFS, we stored the path as the actions for turn31 to turn T-1 (which are T-31 actions). Then we are at (T,9). So H = T - 31.\n\nTherefore, we break when we are at (T,9) for the first time (minimal T) and then H = T - 31, and the actions are the stored path.\n\nBut note: in our BFS, we are storing the action for turn T when we are at state (T,y) and we generate (T+1, y_next). So when we are at state (T,y) we are about to take an action for turn T. Then we generate (T+1, y_next) and we store the action for turn T.\n\nSo when we are at (T,9) -> that means we have already taken an action at turn T-1 that got us to (T,9). Then we break. But we didn't take an action at turn T? \n\nActually, we break when we are at (T,9) at the beginning of turn T. Then we haven't taken an action at turn T. But we are already at 9? Then we don't need to take any more actions. So we are done.\n\nBut the problem: we are to reach (0,9) at some turn. We are at (0,9) at the beginning of turn T. Then we don't need to take an action at turn T. \n\nSo the actions we have taken are for turns 31 to T-1. So the number of actions H = T - 31.\n\nSo we break when we are at (T,9) for any T, and then we output the actions for turns 31 to T-1.\n\nBut in our BFS, we are storing the actions that we took to get to the current state. So when we are at (T,9), the stored path is the actions for turns 31 to T-1. \n\nTherefore, we can break when we are at (T,9) and output the path.\n\nBut note: we must check that (T,9) is safe? Yes, because at turn T we are at y=9 (which is not a freeway) so safe.\n\nTherefore, we modify:\n\n      Start with (31,1, []) -> then we are at turn31 and y=1, and we have an empty path (meaning we haven't taken any action yet).\n\n      Then we consider taking actions at turn31? But we are at the beginning of turn31. Then we take an action at turn31 to go to turn32.\n\n      But when we break? We break when we are at (T,9) for any T.\n\n      So in the BFS, when we pop a state (T,y) and if y==9, we break and output the path.\n\n      But note: the path we have stored is the actions for turns31 to T-1. So when we are at (T,9), we have taken actions for turns31 to T-1. And we are done.\n\n      So we break.\n\nNow, let's run the BFS:\n\n  We start at (31,1,[])\n\n  Then we consider actions at turn31: \n        U: y_next=2 -> state (32,2, ['U'])\n        D: y_next=0 -> state (32,0, ['D'])\n        S: y_next=1 -> state (32,1, ['S'])\n\n  Then we push these.\n\n  Then we pop (32,2,['U']): \n        Then at turn32, we are at y=2. Safe? T=32 not in {34,39,40} -> safe.\n        Actions: \n            U: y_next=3 -> (33,3, ['U','U'])\n            D: y_next=1 -> (33,1, ['U','D'])\n            S: y_next=2 -> (33,2, ['U','S'])\n\n  Similarly for (32,0,['D']): \n        Actions: \n            U: y_next=1 -> (33,1,['D','U'])\n            D: not possible (0->-1 invalid)\n            S: y_next=0 -> (33,0,['D','S'])\n\n  And (32,1,['S']): \n        Actions: same as start? \n            U->2, D->0, S->1.\n\n  Now, we need to avoid being at freeways 3,4,5 at turn34. So at state (34, y) for y in {3,4,5} is unsafe.\n\n  We need to see if we can avoid that.\n\n  We have to get to turn34 at a safe y: y in {0,1,2,6,7,8,9}.\n\n  Then beyond that, we have to avoid freeways6,7,8 at turns39 and40.\n\n  We hope to get to 9 before turn39? Then we don't have to worry about 39 and40? \n\n  Minimal moves: 8 moves (U) -> then at turn39 we would be at 9? \n\n      Start: turn31: y=1\n      After 8 U's: \n          turn32:2, turn33:3, turn34:4 -> but at turn34 we are at y=4 -> unsafe.\n\n  So we need a detour.\n\n  One idea: at some point we go down to avoid being at 3,4,5 at turn34.\n\n  For example: \n      turn31: U -> y=2 at turn32.\n      turn32: D -> y=1 at turn33.\n      turn33: U -> y=2 at turn34. -> safe (y=2 not in {3,4,5})\n\n      Then we can go up: \n          turn34: U -> y=3 at turn35 -> safe? because turn35 is not dangerous? \n          turn35: U -> y=4 at turn36\n          turn36: U -> y=5 at turn37\n          turn37: U -> y=6 at turn38\n          turn38: U -> y=7 at turn39 -> but at turn39, we are at y=7 -> which is freeway7 -> and turn39 is dangerous -> unsafe.\n\n      So we must avoid being at freeway7 at turn39.\n\n      Alternatively, we can go faster: but we are at y=2 at turn34. Then we have to go 7 more steps: 2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9: 7 moves. Then we would be at y=9 at turn41. But we have to check turn39 and40: \n          At turn39: we are at y=?\n          Let's count: \n              turn34: y=2\n              turn34: U -> turn35: y=3\n              turn35: U -> turn36: y=4\n              turn36: U -> turn37: y=5\n              turn37: U -> turn38: y=6\n              turn38: U -> turn39: y=7 -> unsafe at turn39.\n\n      We can avoid by going faster? But we can only move one per turn.\n\n      Or we can wait? \n\n      We are at turn34: y=2. Instead of moving up every turn, we can sometimes stay or move down? But we want to minimize time.\n\n      We need to not be at freeway6,7,8 at turn39 and40.\n\n      We are at turn34: y=2. We have 5 turns to turn39: turns34,35,36,37,38.\n\n      We need to get from y=2 to y=9 in 5 moves? That requires 7 moves? So we cannot get to 9 by turn39? Then we must avoid being at freeways6,7,8 at turn39 and40.\n\n      So at turn39: we must be at y<=5 or y=9? But we are at y=2 and we need to get to 9: we need 7 moves. So at turn39 we will be at y=2+5 = 7? (if we move up every turn). So we are at y=7 at turn39 -> unsafe.\n\n      How to avoid? We can wait at a safe freeway until after turn40.\n\n      For example: we can go to y=0 or y=1 or y=2 and stay there until turn40 is over? Then after turn40, we can go up.\n\n      But we are at turn34: y=2. We can stay at y=2 for 5 turns? Then at turn39: y=2 -> safe (because 2 not in {6,7,8}). Then at turn40: we can move? but we must avoid being at freeways6,7,8 at turn40.\n\n      At turn40: we are still at y=2? Then safe. Then after turn40, we can move up: 7 moves: from y=2 to y=9: 7 moves. So we would be at y=9 at turn47.\n\n      But is that minimal? We might find a better path.\n\n      Alternatively, we can go to y=5 at turn34? But that is unsafe.\n\n      We can go to y=6 at turn34? But turn34: if we are at y=6 -> safe? because 6 not in {3,4,5}. Then we are at y=6 at turn34. Then we have to avoid freeways6,7,8 at turn39 and40.\n\n      How to avoid? We can go down to a safe freeway? \n\n      From y=6 at turn34:\n          We have 5 turns until turn39: \n             We can go down: to y=5, then 4, then 3, then 2, then 1 -> then at turn39: y=1 -> safe.\n          Then at turn40: we are at y=1 -> safe.\n          Then we go up: 8 moves? from 1 to 9: 8 moves -> so at turn48 we get to 9.\n\n      But that takes longer.\n\n      Another idea: go up to y=9 as fast as possible but avoid the dangerous freeways at turn39 and40 by being at y=9 before turn39? \n\n          We start at turn31: y=1.\n          We need 8 moves. \n          We must avoid being at freeway4 at turn34? So we cannot be at y=4 at turn34.\n\n          How about: \n              turn31: U -> y=2 at turn32.\n              turn32: U -> y=3 at turn33. -> but then at turn33: we are at y=3 -> safe (turn33 not dangerous). \n              Then turn33: we can stay? \n                  If we stay at turn33: then at turn34 we are at y=3 -> unsafe.\n\n              So we cannot be at y=3 at turn34.\n\n          So at turn33: we must move: either up to 4 (unsafe at turn34) or down to 2 (safe at turn34). \n\n          So:\n              turn31: U -> turn32: y=2\n              turn32: U -> turn33: y=3\n              turn33: D -> turn34: y=2 -> safe.\n\n          Then we are at y=2 at turn34.\n\n          Now, we have 5 moves until turn39: we need to get to 9? 7 moves required. So we cannot get to 9 by turn39.\n\n          Therefore, we must avoid being at freeways6,7,8 at turn39 and40.\n\n          We can go up to y=5 by turn38? and then wait at y=5 until after turn40? \n\n          Plan from turn34 (y=2) to turn39:\n\n            turn34: U -> turn35: y=3\n            turn35: U -> turn36: y=4\n            turn36: U -> turn37: y=5\n            turn37: S -> turn38: y=5\n            turn38: S -> turn39: y=5 -> safe (5 not in {6,7,8})\n            turn39: S -> turn40: y=5 -> safe (because turn40: we are at y=5, not in {6,7,8})\n\n          Then after turn40, we can move: \n            turn40: U -> turn41: y=6\n            turn41: U -> turn42: y=7\n            turn42: U -> turn43: y=8\n            turn43: U -> turn44: y=9 -> done.\n\n          Total actions: from turn31 to turn43: 13 actions? \n\n          Let me count:\n\n            turn31: U -> to y=2\n            turn32: U -> to y=3\n            turn33: D -> to y=2\n            turn34: U -> to y=3\n            turn35: U -> to y=4\n            turn36: U -> to y=5\n            turn37: S -> to y=5\n            turn38: S -> to y=5\n            turn39: S -> to y=5\n            turn40: U -> to y=6\n            turn41: U -> to y=7\n            turn42: U -> to y=8\n            turn43: U -> to y=9\n\n          Then at turn44: we are at y=9 -> so we break at turn44? \n\n          But note: in our BFS, we break when we are at (T,9) at the beginning of turn T. So at turn44, we are at y=9 -> we break. The actions we took are from turn31 to turn43: that's 13 actions.\n\n          H = 13.\n\n          But is there a shorter path?\n\n          Alternatively, we can go to y=9 faster by not waiting so long? \n\n          We are at turn38: y=5. Then we have to go 4 moves: 5->6->7->8->9: 4 moves. But we are at turn38: then we can move up at turn38,39,40,41,42? \n\n          But at turn38: we are at y=5. \n          turn38: U -> turn39: y=6 -> unsafe at turn39.\n\n          So we cannot move up at turn38? \n\n          We must not be at freeway6,7,8 at turn39 and40. \n\n          So at turn39 and40, we must be at y<=5 or y=9? \n\n          But we are at y=5 at turn38. We can only move one per turn. \n\n          To get to y=9 by turn39: we would need 4 moves: but we only have one move at turn38: then at turn39 we are at y=6 -> unsafe.\n\n          How about: \n              turn38: S -> stay at y=5 at turn39: safe.\n              turn39: S -> stay at y=5 at turn40: safe.\n              turn40: U -> turn41: y=6 -> but now turn41 is safe? because dangerous events only at 34,39,40. So turn41 is safe.\n              then we can go up: \n                  turn41: U -> y=7\n                  turn42: U -> y=8\n                  turn43: U -> y=9 -> break at turn43? \n\n          But wait, we break at the beginning of turn43: we are at y=9? \n\n          Actually, at the beginning of turn43 we are at y=9 -> so we break. Then the actions for turn31 to turn42: 12 actions.\n\n          How? \n            turn31: U\n            turn32: U\n            turn33: D\n            turn34: U\n            turn35: U\n            turn36: U\n            turn37: S   -> at turn37: we are at y=5?

Then we break? But we break when we are at y=9. \n\n          So we need one more: \n            turn43: U -> turn44:9 -> break at turn44.\n\n          Then 13 actions: as before.\n\n          But wait, at turn42: we are at y=8? Then at turn43: we take U -> to y=9 at turn44. So we break at turn44.\n\n          Total actions: 13.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            turn31: U -> 2\n            turn32: U -> 3\n            turn33: D -> 2\n            turn34: U -> 3\n            turn35: U -> 4\n            turn36: U -> 5\n            turn37: U -> 6 -> but at turn37: we are at y=6 -> safe? because turn37 not dangerous. \n            Then we can:\n                turn37: at6 -> but then we have to avoid being at 6,7,8 at turn39 and40.\n\n            How? \n                turn37: at6 -> \n                turn37: D -> turn38:5 -> then we are at 5 at turn38.\n                turn38: S -> turn39:5 (safe)\n                turn39: S -> turn40:5 (safe)\n                turn40: U -> turn41:6\n                turn41: U -> turn42:7\n                turn42: U -> turn43:8\n                turn43: U -> turn44:9 -> break.\n\n            That's also 13 actions.\n\n          Can we do 12? \n\n          We must get from y=1 to y=9: 8 moves. But we have to detour. The detour: we did 2 extra moves: at turn33: we did D (from 3 to 2) and then at turn37: we did D (from 6 to 5) -> that's 2 extra moves? So 8+2=10 moves? But we had to wait at 5 for two turns? Actually, we didn't wait in the above, we moved.\n\n          Actually, we did 13 moves: let me count the moves:\n\n            turn31: U (1 move)\n            turn32: U (2)\n            turn33: D (3)\n            turn34: U (4)\n            turn35: U (5)\n            turn36: U (6)\n            turn37: D (7)   -> so we are at y=5 at turn38? \n            turn38: S (8)   -> still at 5\n            turn39: S (9)   -> still at 5\n            turn40: U (10)\n            turn41: U (11)\n            turn42: U (12)\n            turn43: U (13) -> then at turn44: y=9.\n\n          So 13 actions.\n\n          How about a different path: go to y=0 to avoid?\n\n          turn31: D -> y=0 at turn32.\n          turn32: S -> y=0 at turn33.\n          turn33: S -> y=0 at turn34 -> safe (y=0 not in {3,4,5}).\n          Then we can go up: \n              turn34: U -> y=1 at turn35.\n              turn35: U -> y=2 at turn36.\n              turn36: U -> y=3 at turn37.\n              turn37: U -> y=4 at turn38.\n              turn38: U -> y=5 at turn39 -> safe? because 5 not in {6,7,8}? yes.\n              turn39: U -> y=6 at turn40 -> unsafe at turn40? because y=6 at turn40 is in {6,7,8} -> unsafe.\n\n          So we must avoid.\n\n          Then we do:\n              turn39: S -> y=5 at turn40 -> safe.\n              turn40: U -> y=6 at turn41.\n              turn41: U -> y=7 at turn42.\n              turn42: U -> y=8 at turn43.\n              turn43: U -> y=9 at turn44.\n\n          Then actions: \n            turn31: D\n            turn32: S\n            turn33: S\n            turn34: U\n            turn35: U\n            turn36: U\n            turn37: U\n            turn38: U\n            turn39: S\n            turn40: U\n            turn41: U\n            turn42: U\n            turn43: U\n\n          That's 13 actions.\n\n          Alternatively, we can avoid the unsafe at turn40 by not moving at turn39? But we did.\n\n          How about: after turn38: we are at y=5 at turn39? Then we don't move at turn39: then at turn40 we are still at y=5 -> safe. Then we move up: turn40: U->6, turn41:U->7, turn42:U->8, turn43:U->9 -> 12 moves? \n\n          Let me count the turns and actions:\n\n            turn31: D -> turn32:0\n            turn32: S -> turn33:0\n            turn33: S -> turn34:0\n            turn34: U -> turn35:1\n            turn35: U -> turn36:2\n            turn36: U -> turn37:3\n            turn37: U -> turn38:4\n            turn38: U -> turn39:5   (action8)\n            turn39: S -> turn40:5   (action9: we stay at turn39)\n            turn40: U -> turn41:6   (action10)\n            turn41: U -> turn42:7   (action11)\n            turn42: U -> turn43:8   (action12)\n            turn43: U -> turn44:9   (action13) -> but we break at turn44? \n\n          We break at the beginning of turn44: we are at y=9. The last action was at turn43. So 13 actions.\n\n          But note: at turn39: we did S -> so we are at y=5 at turn40? Then at turn40: we are at y=5 -> safe. Then we can move up at turn40,41,42,43: that's 4 moves: from 5 to 9. So we would be at y=9 at turn44.\n\n          But we did 13 actions.\n\n          However, we can combine: we don't need to stay at y=5 at turn39? We can move up at turn39? but then we are at y=6 at turn40 -> unsafe.\n\n          So we must stay at turn39? \n\n          How about moving up twice quickly? \n\n          We are at turn38: y=5. Then if we move up at turn38 and turn39: \n            turn38: U -> turn39: y=6 -> unsafe.\n\n          So we cannot.\n\n          Therefore, the minimal H is 13.\n\n          But wait, is there a path with 12 actions? \n\n          Let me assume we reach y=9 at turn43 (so 12 actions: from turn31 to turn42). Then we are at (43,9). \n\n          The constraints: \n            At turn34: we must not be at y in {3,4,5}. \n            At turn39: not at {6,7,8}\n            At turn40: not at {6,7,8}\n\n          The moves: 12 actions, so 12 moves? We start at y=1, and we must go to 9: 8 moves up. So we have 4 extra moves? We can use down or stay.\n\n          How to distribute? \n\n          We need to avoid y=3,4,5 at turn34: which is at the 4th state? \n            turn31: start at 1\n            turn31: action -> state at turn32: y1\n            turn32: action -> state at turn33: y2\n            turn33: action -> state at turn34: y3\n\n          So at turn34: we are at y3.\n\n          Similarly, at turn39: we are at y after 8 moves? \n            turn31: action1 -> turn32: y1\n            ...\n            turn38: action8 -> turn39: y8\n\n          And turn40: action9 -> turn40: y9 -> but we want to be at y=9 at turn43, so we have 12 actions: we are at turn43 at y=9.\n\n          The state at turn39: y8 = the position after 8 actions? \n             actions: a0 to a11 (12 actions) -> then we are at turn43.\n\n          The state at turn39: that's after 8 actions? (because from turn31 to turn38: 8 actions) -> then at turn39 we are at the state after the 8th action.\n\n          So we need: \n            At turn34 (after 3 actions): y3 not in {3,4,5}\n            At turn39 (after 8 actions): y8 not in {6,7,8}\n            At turn40 (after 9 actions): y9 not in {6,7,8}\n\n          And we start at 1 and end at 9 after 12 actions.\n\n          The net movement: we need to go up 8 times (because 1 to 9: +8). Let u be the number of U, d for D, s for S, then:\n             u - d = 8\n             u + d + s = 12\n          => 2u + s = 20 -> so u can be from 8 to 12? but u>=8.\n\n          Let u=8, then d=0, s=4.\n          Let u=9, then d=1, s=2.\n          etc.\n\n          Now, we need to assign the moves.\n\n          We must avoid y=3,4,5 at step3 (turn34) and y=6,7,8 at step8 and step9.\n\n          Let me try with u=8, d=0, s=4.\n\n          Then we have 4 stays. We start at 1.\n\n          We have to be at y3 at turn34 not in {3,4,5}. \n\n          How to be at step3 (after 3 actions) at y3? \n            We start at 1.\n            We have used 3 actions: let the number of U in first 3 moves = u3, D=d3, S=s3, with u3+d3+s3=3, and y3 = 1 + u3 - d3.\n\n          We require y3 not in {3,4,5} -> so y3 <=2 or y3>=6? but we are at step3, we cannot be at 6. So y3 in {0,1,2}.\n\n          Also, we have 5 more moves to get to step8: we need to go from y3 to y8, and we have 5 actions: with total U in the next 5 moves: u5, and total in 8 moves: u3+u5=8? but we have 8 U in total.\n\n          So u3+u5=8, and we have 5 actions for moves 4 to 8: so u5=8-u3.\n\n          Since u3 is the number of U in the first 3 moves, and we have 3 moves, u3<=3. Then u5=8-u3>=5. But we only have 5 moves, so u5<=5. Therefore, 8-u3<=5 -> u3>=3. But u3<=3, so u3=3.\n\n          Then u5=5.\n\n          Then the first 3 moves must be 3 U's: \n              turn31: U -> y=2\n              turn32: U -> y=3\n              turn33: U -> y=4 -> but at turn34 (after 3 moves) we are at y=4 -> unsafe.\n\n          So impossible.\n\n          Next: u=9, d=1, s=2.\n\n          Then y3 = 1 + u3 - d3, and u3+d3+s3=3.\n\n          Also, the net for the first 3 moves: u3-d3 = y3-1.\n\n          We require y3 in {0,1,2}.\n\n          And total: the next 9 moves (from move4 to move12) must have u_next=9-u3, d_next=1-d3, s_next=2-s3.\n\n          But also, the net movement for the whole: 9 - 1 = 8, which is correct.\n\n          Now, at step8 (after 8 actions): y8 = y3 + (u_next5) - (d_next5)  [where u_next5 is the U in the first 5 moves of the next 9 moves? actually, moves 4 to 8: 5 moves]\n\n          But we have to ensure that y8 not in {6,7,8}. And y9 = y8 + (action at move9) not in {6,7,8}? \n\n          But we have to avoid y8 in {6,7,8} and y9 in {6,7,8}. \n\n          Since we are at y8 and then we take action9 (which is one of U,D,S), then y9 = y8 + {-1,0,1}. To be safe, y8 must be not in {6,7,8} and also y9 must be not in {6,7,8}. \n\n          How? \n            If y8=5, then we can do U->6 (unsafe at y9) or S->5 (safe) or D->4 (safe). \n            If y8=6, then any move: U->7 (unsafe), S->6 (unsafe), D->5 (safe) -> but then y9=5 is safe, but y8=6 is unsafe.\n\n          So we must have y8 not in {6,7,8} and then we can choose an action that keeps y9 not in {6,7,8}. \n\n          The only safe states at step8 are y8 in {0,1,2,3,4,5,9}. And then we choose an action such that y9 in {0,1,2,3,4,5,9} and not in {6,7,8}. But if we are at y8=5, then we can do D to 4 or S to 5 -> then y9 safe. Or U to 6 -> unsafe.\n\n          So we must avoid y8 in {6,7,8}. \n\n          Therefore, we require y8<=5 or y8=9.\n\n          Now, we have:\n            y3 in {0,1,2}\n            y8 = y3 + (u_next5 - d_next5)  [for moves4..8: 5 moves]\n\n          And we have: \n            u_next5 + d_next5 + s_next5 = 5\n            and u_next5 - d_next5 = y8 - y3\n\n          Also, the entire next9 moves: \n            u_next = 9 - u3\n            d_next = 1 - d3\n            s_next = 2 - s3\n\n          But we are only concerned with the first 5 moves of the next9 for y8.\n\n          And we require y8<=5 or y8=9.\n\n          And then we have 4 more moves (moves9..12) to get to y=9.\n\n          But net movement from y8 to y12: \n            y12 = y8 + (u_next4 - d_next4) = 9\n\n          So u_next4 - d_next4 = 9 - y8.\n\n          And we have 4 moves: u_next4+d_next4+s_next4=4.\n\n          Now, we have u3, d3, s3 for the first 3 moves: \n            u3 + d3 + s3 = 3\n            y3 = 1 + u3 - d3 in {0,1,2}\n\n          So 1+u3-d3 <=2 -> u3-d3<=1.\n          and 1+u3-d3>=0 -> u3-d3>=-1.\n\n          Also, u3<=3, d3<=3.\n\n          Let me try values:\n\n          Case 1: y3=0 -> 1+u3-d3=0 -> u3-d3=-1.\n          Case 2: y3=1 -> u3-d3=0.\n          Case 3: y3=2 -> u3-d3=1.\n\n          Now, we have to have u3>=0, d3>=0.\n\n          Also, the next9 moves: u_next = 9 - u3, d_next=1-d3, s_next=2-s3.\n\n          For the first 5 moves of the next9: we need to achieve y8 = y3 + (u_next5 - d_next5) in {0,1,2,3,4,5,9}. But since y3 in {0,1,2} and we only have 5 moves, the maximum we can go up is 5, so y8<= y3+5<=7. We cannot reach 9 in 5 moves from y3<=2. So y8<=7. Then we require y8<=5.\n\n          So y3 + (u_next5 - d_next5) <=5.\n\n          And u_next5 and d_next5 are nonnegative, and u_next5<=u_next=9-u3, and d_next5<=d_next=1-d3.\n\n          This is getting complex.\n\n          Let me try a specific example with y3=2.\n\n          Then u3-d3=1.\n\n          Possibilities for (u3,d3,s3):\n            (1,0,2): then u_next=8, d_next=1, s_next=0.\n            (2,1,0): then u_next=7, d_next=0, s_next=2.\n            (3,2,0): then u_next=6, d_next=-1 -> invalid.\n\n          So only two possibilities.\n\n          Try (1,0,2): \n            First 3 moves: U, S, S? \n                turn31: U -> y=2\n                turn32: S -> y=2\n                turn33: S -> y=2 -> then at turn34: y=2, safe.\n            Then we have 9 moves: 8U and 1D and 0S.\n\n            We need to be at y8<=5 after 5 moves (moves4..8) and then in the next4 moves we go from y8 to 9.\n\n            After 5 moves (from move4 to move8): we have to use some of the U and the D. We have 8U and 1D in 9 moves, but we are doing 5 moves now.\n\n            Let the next5 moves have u5 U, d5 D, s5 S, then u5+d5+s5=5, and we have u5<=8, d5<=1.\n\n            Then y8 = 2 + u5 - d5.\n\n            We require y8<=5.\n\n            Also, after these 5 moves, we have left: U: 8-u5, D: 1-d5, S:0.\n\n            Then in the next4 moves, we do the remaining: 8-u5 U and 1-d5 D and 0S.\n\n            Then y12 = y8 + (8-u5) - (1-d5) = (2+u5-d5) + 8-u5 -1 +d5 = 9.\n\n            So it checks out.\n\n            Now, we require y8 = 2+u5-d5<=5.\n\n            And we have to avoid at step8 and step9: \n                at step8: y8 not in {6,7,8} -> we have y8<=5, so safe.\n                at step9: y9 = y8 + a9, and a9 is the first of the next4 moves.\n\n            We also have to ensure that in the moves, we don't go below0 or above9? \n\n            Now, we have flexibility in how we do the next5 moves.\n\n            We need to achieve: 2+u5-d5<=5 -> u5-d5<=3.\n\n            And u5 in [0,8] and d5 in [0,1] and u5+d5<=5.\n\n            We also have to have at step9: y9 = y8 + a9 not in {6,7,8}. But since y8<=5, if we do U then y9=y8+1<=6. We must avoid y9=6? So we cannot do U if y8=5.\n\n            So if y8=5, then a9 must be S or D. \n\n            How about we try to set y8=5? \n                then 2+u5-d5=5 -> u5-d5=3.\n\n            With d5<=1, then u5=4 or 5? \n                if d5=0, u5=3 -> no, 3-0=3 -> yes.\n                if d5=1, u5=4 -> 4-1=3.\n\n            So two options.\n\n            Option1: d5=0, u5=3. Then in the first5 of the next9: 3U and 0D and 2S.\n                y8 = 2+3-0=5.\n            Then the remaining moves: 8-3=5U, 1-0=1D, and 0S. And we have 4 moves to do 5U and 1D? -> not possible because 5+1=6>4.\n\n            Option2: d5=1, u5=4. Then in the first5: 4U, 1D, 0S -> but we have only 0S? then 4+1=5 moves.\n                y8=2+4-1=5.\n            Then remaining: 8-4=4U, 1-1=0D, 0S. Then in 4 moves: 4U -> then we can do 4U.\n\n            So the moves for the next9:\n                moves4..8: 4U and 1D -> we can do: U,U,U,D,U? or any order. \n                    y3=2 (at move3, turn34)\n                    move4: U->3\n                    move5: U->4\n                    move6: U->5\n                    move7: D->4\n                    move8: U->5 -> so at turn39: y=5 -> safe.\n\n            Then move9: U (first of the remaining) -> y=6 at turn40 -> unsafe.\n\n            Oh no! at turn40: we are at y=6 -> unsafe.\n\n            So we must not do U at move9 if we are at y8=5.\n\n            How about move9: S or D? \n                If we do S: y9=5 -> safe.\n                Then we have to do 4U in the next3 moves? \n                    move10: U->6\n                    move11: U->7\n                    move12: U->8 -> then we are at y=8 at turn43, not 9.\n\n            We need to get to 9: from 5 at move9, we need to go to 9: +4, but we only have 3 moves: move10,11,12 -> not enough.\n\n            How about: \n                move9: D -> y=4 at turn40 -> safe.\n                then move10: U->5\n                move11: U->6\n                move12: U->7 -> not 9.\n\n            Not enough.\n\n            Therefore, we cannot achieve it.\n\n            We must have y8<=4, so that we can do U at move9 and not exceed 5? But then we can do more U later.\n\n            Let me try y8=4.\n\n            Then 2+u5-d5=4 -> u5-d5=2.\n\n            With d5 in {0,1}:\n                d5=0 -> u5=2.\n                d5=1 -> u5=3.\n\n            Try d5=0, u5=2: then in moves4..8: 2U,0D,3S.\n                Then y8=2+2-0=4.\n                Remaining: 6U, 1D, 0S in 4 moves: not possible (6+1=7>4).\n\n            Try d5=1, u5=3: then in moves4..8: 3U,1D,1S.\n                y8=2+3-1=4.\n                Remaining: 5U,0D,0S in 4 moves: then 5U in 4 moves: we can do 4U and one move missing? no.\n\n            How about y8=3: then u5-d5=1.\n                d5=0: u5=1 -> then moves4..8: 1U,0D,4S. -> y8=2+1-0=3.\n                Remaining: 7U,1D,0S in 4 moves: 7+1>4 -> impossible.\n                d5=1: u5=2 -> moves4..8: 2U,1D,2S. -> y8=2+2-1=3.\n                Remaining: 6U,0D,0S in 4 moves: 6>4 -> impossible.\n\n            y8=2: then u5-d5=0.\n                d5=0: u5=0 -> moves4..8: 0U,0D,5S. -> y8=2.\n                Remaining: 8U,1D,0S in 4 moves: 9>4 -> impossible.\n                d5=1: u5=1 -> moves4..8: 1U,1D,3S. -> y8=2+1-1=2.\n                Remaining: 7U,0D,0S in 4 moves: 7>4 -> impossible.\n\n          So this branch (y3=2) fails.\n\n          Try y3=1.\n\n          Then u3-d3=0.\n\n          Possibilities: \n            (0,0,3): then u_next=9, d_next=1, s_next=-1 -> invalid.\n            (1,1,1): then u_next=8, d_next=0, s_next=1.\n            (2,2,0): then u_next=7, d_next=-1 -> invalid.\n\n          So only (1,1,1).\n          First 3 moves: to have u3=1, d3=1, s3=1: \n              turn31: U -> y=2\n              turn32: D -> y=1\n              turn33: S -> y=1 -> safe at turn34.\n\n          Then next9 moves: 8U,0D,1S.\n\n          In the first5 moves (moves4..8): we use u5 U, d5 D, s5 S, and we require y8 = 1 + u5 - d5 in {0,1,2,3,4,5} (since we cannot reach 9).\n\n          Also, u5<=8, d5<=0 (because d_next=0) -> so d5=0.\n\n          Then y8 = 1+u5.\n\n          We require 1+u5<=5 -> u5<=4.\n\n          Then the remaining moves: 8-u5 U, 0D, 1-s5 S. And we have 4 moves.\n\n          And then we need to go from y8 to 9: which requires 9 - y8 = 8 - u5.\n\n          In the next4 moves: we have to do 8-u5 U's and some S's? and no D's.\n\n          The number of U's is 8-u5, and we have 4 moves, and also we have 1-s5 S's to use? Actually, the S's can be distributed arbitrarily in the next4 moves? \n\n          But note: the entire next9 moves have only 1S. We haven't used any S in the first5 moves? \n\n          In the first5 moves: we have used s5. Then the remaining S's: 1 - s5.\n\n          The moves9..12: we have to use the remaining: (8-u5) U's and (1-s5) S's? but then the number of moves is (8-u5) + (1-s5) = 9 - u5 - s5.\n\n          But we only have 4 moves. So 9 - u5 - s5 <= 4 -> 5 <= u5+s5.\n\n          But we also have in the first5 moves: u5+s5<=5.\n\n          So 5<=u5+s5<=5 -> u5+s5=5.\n\n          And then 9 - u5 - s5 =4, which matches.\n\n          So we must use in the first5 moves: u5 (which is<=4) and s5=5-u5.\n\n          Then the first5 moves: \n              moves4..8: u5 U's and (5-u5) S's.\n\n          And we have to ensure that we stay within [0,9]? \n\n          Start at y3=1.\n          Then after 5 moves: y8 = 1 + u5.\n\n          We require u5<=4, and s5=5-u5>=1.\n\n          And then the next4 moves: (8-u5) U's and (1 - (5-u5)) = u5-4 S's? but wait, we only have 1 S in the next9 moves. And we used s5=5-u5 in the first5. So the remaining S's: 1 - (5-u5) = u5-4.\n\n          But we also have to do 8-u5 U's.\n\n          So moves9..12: \n              total actions: (8-u5) U's and (u5-4) S's? and we have 4 moves.\n\n          But the number of actions: (8-u5)+(u5-4)=4, which is correct.\n\n          Now, we require that at step9: we are at y9 = y8 + a9, and a9 is the first action in moves9..12.\n\n          But we have to avoid y9 in {6,7,8}. \n\n          y8 = 1+u5. Since u5<=4, y8<=5.\n\n          If we do U at move9: then y9 = y8+1 = 2+u5. \n             This is safe as long as 2+u5 not in {6,7,8} -> but 2+u5<=6, and we require not 6? so if 2+u5=6 -> u5=4 -> then y9=6 -> unsafe.\n\n          So if u5=4, we cannot do U first.\n\n          How about if we do S first? then y9 = y8 = 1+u5.\n\n          This is safe because 1+u5<=5.\n\n          Then we do the remaining: 8-u5-1 = 7-u5 U's and (u5-4) S's in the next3 moves.\n\n          And then we have to get to 9: \n             after move9: y9 = 1+u5.\n             then after move10,11,12: we will have y12 = 1+u5 + (7-u5) = 8 -> not 9.\n\n          We are missing one U.\n\n          Alternatively, after move9 (S) we have to do the remaining actions: 8-u5 U's and (u5-4) S's. The net movement from y9: (8-u5) - 0 = 8-u5.\n\n          So y12 = y9 + (8-u5) = (1+u5) + (8-u5) = 9.  Good.\n\n          But the number of moves: move9: S, then moves10,11,12: we need to do 8-u5 U's and (u5-4) S's, and 8-u5 + (u5-4) = 4, which is the number of moves? no, we only have 3 moves left.\n\n          We have move9,10,11,12: 4 moves. We used move9 for S. Then moves10,11,12: 3 moves for 8-u5 U's and (u5-4) S's.\n\n          The sum: 8-u5 + u5-4 = 4, which requires 4 moves, but we only have 3 moves.\n\n          Contradiction.\n\n          Therefore, the only hope is to do U first at move9, but then if u5=4, we get y9=6, unsafe.\n\n          For u5<4, we can do U first: then y9=2+u5. Since u5<=3, then y9<=5 -> safe.\n\n          Then the net from move9 to move12: we do in moves9..12: \n             move9: U -> y9=1+u5+1=2+u5\n             then moves10..12: 7-u5 U's and (u5-4) S's? \n\n          But the number of U's we have to do in the next4 moves is 8-u5. We already did 1 U, so we have to do 7-u5 U's and (u5-4) S's in 3 moves.\n\n          And 7-u5 + (u5-4) = 3, which is good.\n\n          Then the final y12 = y9 + (7-u5) = (2+u5) + (7-u5) = 9. Good.\n\n          Now, we need to check if we have enough S's: the total S's in the next9 moves is 1. We haven't used any in the first5 moves? because in the first5 moves we did u5 U's and s5=5-u5 S's. Then the remaining S's: 1 - (5-u5) = u5-4.\n\n          And we are using exactly u5-4 S's in the last3 moves.\n\n          But u5-4 must be nonnegative? only if u5>=4. But we are now in the case u5<4, then u5-4<0 -> not possible.\n\n          Therefore, no solution for y3=1.\n\n          Finally, try y3=0.\n\n          Then 1+u3-d3=0 -> u3-d3=-1.\n\n          Possibilities:\n            (0,1,2): then u_next=9, d_next=0, s_next=0.\n            (1,2,0): then u_next=8, d_next=-1 -> invalid.\n\n          So only (0,1,2).\n\n          First 3 moves: 0U,1D,2S.\n            turn31: D -> y=0\n            turn32: S -> y=0\n            turn33: S -> y=0 -> safe.\n\n          Then next9: 9U,0D,0S.\n\n          In the first5 moves (moves4..8): we use u5 U's, then y8=0+u5.\n\n          We require y8<=5 -> u5<=5.\n\n          Then the next4 moves: 9-u5 U's.\n\n          We need to go from y8 to 9: then 0+u5 + (9-u5) = 9. Good.\n\n          And we have 4 moves for 9-u5 U's: so 9-u5<=4 -> u5>=5.\n\n          And from above, u5<=5. So u5=5.\n\n          Then moves4..8: 5U -> then y8=5.\n          Then moves9..12: 4U in 4 moves: U,U,U,U -> y12=5+4=9.\n\n          Now, check dangerous turns:\n            turn39: after 8 moves (moves0 to 7? or moves1..8) -> \n               actions: \n                 move0: D (at turn31)\n                 move1: S (32)\n                 move2: S (33)\n                 move3: U (34)\n                 move4: U (35)\n                 move5: U (36)\n                 move6: U (37)\n                 move7: U (38) -> then at turn39: we are at y=5 (because move7 is at turn38, leading to turn39) -> safe.\n            turn40: after move8: \n                 move8: U (39) -> at turn40: y=6 -> unsafe.\n\n          Oh! at turn40: we are at y=6 -> unsafe.\n\n          How to avoid? \n            We are at move8: which is at turn39: we do U -> then at turn40: y=6.\n          But we cannot be at y=6 at turn40.\n\n          So we cannot do U at turn39.\n\n          But we have to do 4U's in moves9..12: which are at turns40,41,42,43. \n\n          But at move8 (turn39) we are at y=5. We have to do U eventually, but we can do S or D at turn39? \n\n          But we have to use the actions: in the next9 moves we have 9U's. We've used 5 in moves3..7? \n            moves0..2: at turn31,32,33: we did D,S,S.\n            move3: at turn34: U -> y=1\n            move4: turn35: U->2\n            move5: turn36: U->3\n            move6: turn37: U->4\n            move7: turn38: U->5\n            then move8: turn39: ? we have to do U eventually, but we have to do 4 more U's. But at turn39, if we do U: then at turn40: y=6 -> unsafe.\n\n          If we do not do U at turn39, but we have to do it later. But the moves are scheduled in the next9 moves: we must do 9U's. \n\n          We could postpone one U to after turn40? \n\n          But at turn39: we are at y=5. We can do S at turn39: then at turn40: y=5 -> safe. Then at turn40: we do U->6, but turn40 is dangerous for freeways6,7,8? -> unsafe.\n\n          Or do D at turn39: then y=4 at turn40 -> safe. Then we can do U later.

The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on freeways 3, 4, or 5 at turn 34, and not on freeways 6, 7, or 8 at turns 39 and 40.\n\nThe actions are as follows:\n\n- At turn 31, move up (U) to \\(y = 2\\).\n- At turn 32, move up (U) to \\(y = 3\\).\n- At turn 33, move down (D) to \\(y = 2\\) (avoiding \\(y = 4\\) at turn 34).\n- At turn 34, move up (U) to \\(y = 3\\).\n- At turn 35, move up (U) to \\(y = 4\\).\n- At turn 36, move up (U) to \\(y = 5\\).\n- At turn 37, stay (S) at \\(y = 5\\).\n- At turn 38, stay (S) at \\(y = 5\\).\n- At turn 39, stay (S) at \\(y = 5\\) (avoiding freeways 6-8 at turn 39).\n- At turn 40, move up (U) to \\(y = 6\\) (avoiding freeways 6-8 at turn 40).\n- At turn 41, move up (U) to \\(y = 7\\).\n- At turn 42, move up (U) to \\(y = 8\\).\n- At turn 43, move up (U) to \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThis sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 44 (after 13 actions) without colliding with any cars.\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 31: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 32: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 33: \\text{ D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 34: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 35: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 36: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 37: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 38: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 39: \\text{ S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 40: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 41: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 42: \\text{ U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 43: \\text{ U}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t1 = 34, and I start at y=0.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movements. For each car, I have its position at turn t1=34, and I need to know where it will be at future turns to avoid being on the same freeway when the car's span includes x=0.\n\nThe collision happens only if at turn T, I am on freeway y_T, and there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in its span at that exact turn.\n\nAlso, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that new y until the next turn. So if I move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T I'm still on y, and at turn T+1 I'm on y+1.\n\nThe player update is: at each turn, I choose an action: U (up, y increases by 1), D (down, y decreases by 1), or S (stay, y same). And y is clamped between 0 and 9, so I can't go below 0 or above 9.\n\nSince I start at 0 and need to get to 9, I probably need to go up most of the time, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid cars.\n\nNow, let's list all the cars and their movements.\n\nFirst, for freeway 1: one car, head 48, tail 83, direction left, speed 36.\n\nDirection left means it's moving left, so as time increases, the head and tail decrease by speed times time.\n\nAt turn t1=34, span is [h, τ] for left-moving? Let's see the notation.\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ], and at time T, Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (48, 83, left, 36)\n\nBut head and tail: for left-moving, it says Span(t1) = [h, τ], but h=48, τ=83. If it's moving left, and head is smaller than tail? That seems odd.\n\nTypically, head should be the front. Let's read carefully.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\"\n\nBut in the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor freeway 1: (48, 83, left, 36)\n\nIf direction is left, and head=48, tail=83, that means tail is larger, so the car is facing left, so head is at smaller x, tail at larger x. When moving left, both decrease.\n\nAt t1=34, span is [48, 83], meaning from x=48 to x=83? But that would be rightwards, not left.\n\nI think there might be inconsistency in notation.\n\nLet's read the car update rules.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\"\n\nAnd it says \"head is at h, tail is at τ\"\n\nBut for left-moving, if it's moving left, head should be at the left end, I think.\n\nIn the right-moving case: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\"\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h], and τ and h, with h being head.\n\nIn the table, for example, freeway 3: (48, 37, right, 12), but it says (head, tail, direction, speed), so for this, head=48, tail=37, direction right.\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [37, 48], I think, and it moves right.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, freeway 1: head=48, tail=83, direction left, so Span(t1) = [h, τ] = [48, 83], and since moving left, at time T, it becomes [48 - s(T-t1), 83 - s(T-t1)]\n\nBut [48,83] means from x=48 to x=83, which is a length of 35, since 83-48=35.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving freeway 3, (48,37,right,12), head=48, tail=37, so for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [37,48], and moves to [37 + s(T-t1), 48 + s(T-t1)]\n\nNow, collision occurs at turn T if I am on freeway y_T, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in Span(T).\n\nSpan(T) is the interval at turn T.\n\nAlso, since the grid is infinite, cars can be at any x, but we only care when 0 is in their span.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway for each turn.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars per freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (48, 83, left, 36)\n\nFreeway 2: one car: (48, 83, left, 36)  same as freeway 1\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: (48, 37, right, 12), (12, 1, right, 12), (-24, -35, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3: (48, 37, right, 12), (12, 1, right, 12), (-24, -35, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 3: (48, 37, right, 12), (12, 1, right, 12), (-24, -35, right, 12)\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (48, 37, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 7: one car: (48, 37, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: (48, 37, right, 6), (0, -11, right, 6)\n\nNow, for each, I need to find for which turns T, 0 is in some car's span on that freeway.\n\nLet t = T - t1, so t is the number of turns after t1=34.\n\nAt turn T, t = T - 34.\n\nFor a car, at time T, the span is as above.\n\nCollision if 0 in [low, high] for that car.\n\nSince multiple cars, I need for each freeway, the set of t where it is occupied at x=0.\n\n\"Occupied\" meaning some car has 0 in its span.\n\nThen, for me to be on that freeway at turn T, it must not be occupied at that turn.\n\nNow, let's compute for each freeway the times when it is occupied.\n\nStart with freeway 1: car (48,83,left,36)\n\nSpan at T: [48 - 36t, 83 - 36t] where t = T - 34\n\n0 in [48 - 36t, 83 - 36t] if 48 - 36t <= 0 <= 83 - 36t\n\nSo 48 - 36t <= 0 => 36t >= 48 => t >= 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333\n\nAnd 0 <= 83 - 36t => 36t <= 83 => t <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305\n\nSo t >= 1.333 and t <= 2.305, so since t integer, t=2? t from 1.333 to 2.305, so t=2 only? t=1: 48-36=12, 83-36=47, 0 not in [12,47]\n\nt=2: 48-72= -24, 83-72=11, 0 in [-24,11] yes\n\nt=3: 48-108= -60, 83-108= -25, 0 not in [-60,-25]\n\nSo only at t=2, which is T=34+2=36, freeway 1 is occupied.\n\nt=T-34, so for freeway 1, occupied only at T=36.\n\nt=2, T=36.\n\nNow freeway 2: same car, same thing, occupied only at T=36.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12)\n\nFor right-moving, Span(T) = [τ + s t, h + s t] where t=T-34\n\nτ=37, h=48, s=12\n\nSpan(T) = [37 + 12t, 48 + 12t]\n\n0 in [37+12t, 48+12t] if 37+12t <= 0 <= 48+12t\n\nBut 37+12t <=0? 12t <= -37, t <= -37/12 ≈ -3.083, but t>=0, so never, since 37+12t >=37>0, so 0 not in [37+12t,48+12t] for t>=0.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12,1,right,12)\n\nHead=12, tail=1, direction right.\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [1,12]? τ=tail=1, h=head=12, so [1,12]\n\nAt T: [1 + 12t, 12 + 12t]\n\n0 in [1+12t, 12+12t] if 1+12t <= 0 <= 12+12t\n\n1+12t <=0 => 12t <= -1, t <= -1/12, impossible since t>=0.\n\nAnd 0 <= 12+12t always true for t>=0, but since 1+12t >=1>0, 0 not in interval.\n\n[1+12t, 12+12t] for t=0 is [1,12], all positive, 0 not in.\n\nFor t>0, larger, so never contains 0.\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nHead=-24, tail=-35? Tail should be behind.\n\nDirection right, so head is front.\n\nSpan(t1) = [τ, h] = [-35, -24]? τ=tail=-35, h=head=-24\n\nAt T: [ -35 + 12t, -24 + 12t ]\n\n0 in [ -35+12t, -24+12t ] if -35+12t <= 0 <= -24+12t\n\nFirst, -35+12t <=0 => 12t <=35 => t <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916\n\nSecond, 0 <= -24+12t => 12t >=24 => t >=2\n\nSo t>=2 and t<=2.916, so t=2 and t=3? t=2: -35+24= -11, -24+24=0, so [ -11, 0 ], 0 is included? Since it says 0 in span, and -11 <=0<=0, yes, 0 is the endpoint.\n\nSimilarly, t=3: -35+36=1, -24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nt=2: -35+24= -11, -24+24=0, so [ -11, 0 ], and 0 <=0 is true, so 0 is in the span.\n\nAt t=2, T=36, span [ -11, 0 ], so at x=0, which is the head? Head is at -24 +12*2 = -24+24=0, so head at 0.\n\nNow, for freeway 3, the third car has 0 in span at t=2, T=36.\n\nOther cars don't have 0 in span for any t.\n\nSo freeway 3 occupied at T=36.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 and 5 are same as 3, so occupied at T=36.\n\nNow freeway 6: one car (48,37,right,6)\n\nHead=48, tail=37, direction right.\n\nSpan(T) = [τ + s t, h + s t] = [37 + 6t, 48 + 6t]\n\n0 in [37+6t, 48+6t]? 37+6t >=37>0, so never.\n\nFreeway 7: same, (48,37,right,6), same as above, never has 0 in span.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,6), same as above, never has 0.\n\nSecond car: (0,-11,right,6)\n\nHead=0, tail=-11, direction right.\n\nSpan(t1) = [τ, h] = [-11, 0]? τ=tail=-11, h=head=0\n\nAt T: [ -11 + 6t, 0 + 6t ] = [ -11 + 6t, 6t ]\n\n0 in [ -11+6t, 6t ] if -11+6t <= 0 <= 6t\n\nFirst, -11+6t <=0 => 6t <=11 => t <= 11/6 ≈1.833\n\nSecond, 0 <= 6t => t >=0, always for t>=0.\n\nSo for t=0,1? t=0: [ -11, 0 ], 0 in it.\n\nt=1: [ -11+6, 6 ] = [-5,6], 0 in it.\n\nt=2: [ -11+12, 12] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 8, at t=0 (T=34) and t=1 (T=35), it is occupied because of the second car.\n\nAt t=0, T=34, span [ -11, 0 ], includes 0.\n\nAt t=1, T=35, span [ -5, 6 ], includes 0.\n\nAt t=2, T=36, span [1,12], no.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, the turns when it is occupied (collision if I am there).\n\nFreeway 1: occupied at T=36\n\nFreeway 2: occupied at T=36\n\nFreeway 3: occupied at T=36\n\nFreeway 4: occupied at T=36\n\nFreeway 5: occupied at T=36\n\nFreeway 6: never occupied\n\nFreeway 7: never occupied\n\nFreeway 8: occupied at T=34 and T=35\n\nT=34 and T=35.\n\nNow, I start at turn t1=34, position y=0.\n\nAt turn T, I am on freeway y_T.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal H is probably 9, since I need to go from 0 to 9, at least 9 up moves, but I can stay or go down, so H >=9, but could be more if I need to wait.\n\nBut I might not need to wait if I can avoid the occupied times.\n\nNow, let me denote the turns starting from t=0, where t is offset from t1=34.\n\nSo turn relative: t=0, T=34\n\nt=1, T=35\n\nt=2, T=36\n\netc.\n\nI start at y=0 at t=0.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn, say t=H-1.\n\nMinimal H.\n\nNow, at each turn t, I choose action U, D, or S, which changes y for next turn.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on action at t.\n\nPosition at turn t is y_t.\n\nAfter action at t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nNow, collision at turn t if y_t is between 1 and 8, and freeway y_t is occupied at that turn t.\n\nAt turn t, I am on y_t, and if y_t in {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, and if freeway y_t is occupied at turn T=34+t, then collision.\n\nFor y=0 and y=9, no cars, so no collision possible.\n\nI start at y=0, t=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at turn H-1.\n\nNow, the occupied times:\n\nFor each freeway, occupied at:\n\ny=1: at t=2 (T=36)\n\ny=2: at t=2\n\ny=3: at t=2\n\ny=4: at t=2\n\ny=5: at t=2\n\ny=6: never\n\ny=7: never\n\ny=8: at t=0 and t=1 (T=34,35)\n\nt=0: T=34, y=8 occupied\n\nt=1: T=35, y=8 occupied\n\nt=2: T=36, y=1 to 5 occupied.\n\ny=6 and y=7 never occupied, so always safe.\n\ny=8 occupied only at t=0 and t=1, so for t>=2, y=8 is safe.\n\nBut t=0 and t=1, y=8 is occupied.\n\nNow, I start at t=0, y=0.\n\nAt t=0, I am on y=0, which is safe.\n\nI choose action for turn t=0, which will affect y at t=1.\n\nSimilarly, at each turn.\n\nI need to go up to y=9.\n\nSince y=6 and y=7 are always safe, I might want to go through them.\n\nBut I need to avoid being on y=1-5 at t=2, and y=8 at t=0 and t=1.\n\nt=0 and t=1 are the first two turns.\n\nSince I start at y=0, I can go up or stay.\n\nIf I go up to y=1 at t=1, but at t=1, y=1 might be safe? At t=1, T=35, which freeways occupied?\n\nAt T=35, which is t=1.\n\nFrom above:\n\ny=1 occupied only at t=2, not t=1.\n\nSimilarly y=2 to 5 only at t=2.\n\ny=8 occupied at t=0 and t=1.\n\nAt t=1, T=35, y=8 is occupied, but y=1 to 7?\n\ny=1: at t=1, T=35, not occupied, since only t=2.\n\nSimilarly y=2,3,4,5 not occupied at t=1.\n\ny=6,7 never occupied.\n\ny=8 occupied at t=1.\n\nSo at t=1, only y=8 is occupied.\n\nSimilarly, at t=0, only y=8 occupied, but y=8 is the only one with cars at t=0, but since I start at y=0, not affected.\n\nNow, at t=2, y=1,2,3,4,5 occupied.\n\ny=6,7,8 not occupied at t=2? y=8: occupied at t=0 and t=1, not at t=2.\n\nAt t=2, T=36, y=1 to 5 occupied, y=6,7,8 free.\n\ny=8 free at t=2.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9.\n\nTo minimize H, I should go up as fast as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nStart at t=0, y=0.\n\nAction at t=0: I can choose U, D, or S.\n\nIf I choose U, then y_{1} = 1\n\nThen at t=1, I am on y=1.\n\nAt t=1, y=1 is not occupied (only occupied at t=2), so safe.\n\nThen I can choose action at t=1.\n\nIf I choose U again, y_{2} = 2\n\nAt t=2, I am on y=2.\n\nBut at t=2, y=2 is occupied, so collision! Bad.\n\nSo if I go up twice, at t=2 I am on y=2, which is occupied.\n\nIf I go up once to y=1 at t=1, then at t=1 I am safe, but if I stay or go down at t=1, but I need to go up eventually.\n\nAt t=1, I am on y=1, I can choose S, then y_{2} =1, at t=2 I am on y=1, which is occupied at t=2, collision.\n\nOr choose D, y_{2}=0, then at t=2 on y=0, safe, but I went down, not progress.\n\nBut at t=0, if I choose S, y_{1}=0, stay at y=0 at t=1, then I can choose U at t=1, to y_{2}=1 at t=2? y_{t} at turn t.\n\nAt t=1, y=0 (if I stayed), choose U, then y_{2} =1.\n\nAt t=2, I am on y=1, which is occupied, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=1 at t=1, and at t=1 I choose to go to y=2 at t=2, but y=2 occupied at t=2.\n\nProblem is that at t=2, y=1 to 5 are all occupied, so I cannot be on any of them at turn t=2.\n\nI need to not be on y=1,2,3,4,5 at exactly turn t=2.\n\nAlso, for y=8, I cannot be on it at t=0 or t=1, but since I start below, it might not be immediate.\n\nNow, y=6 and y=7 are always safe, so I should aim to be on them or above during critical times.\n\nBut I start from below.\n\nSince at t=2, y=1-5 are bad, I need to be either below 1 or above 5 at t=2.\n\nBelow 1 means y=0.\n\nAbove 5 means y=6,7,8,9.\n\nBut y=8 at t=2 is safe, as we said.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nNow, at t=0, I am at y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nPossible actions.\n\nOption 1: stay at y=0 until after t=2.\n\nFor example, at t=0, choose S, then y_{1}=0, at t=1 I am on y=0.\n\nAt t=1, choose S, then y_{2}=0, at t=2 I am on y=0, safe.\n\nThen after t=2, I can start moving up.\n\nAt t=2, I am at y=0, choose action to go up.\n\nBut t=2 is past, now from t=3 onwards, no more occupied times, since only t=2 for y=1-5 and t=0,1 for y=8.\n\nAfter t=2, all freeways are safe.\n\ny=6 and y=7 always safe, y=8 safe for t>=2, y=1-5 only occupied at t=2, so for t>2, safe.\n\nSo after t=2, I can move freely.\n\nNow, from y=0 at t=2, I need to go to y=9.\n\nEach up move increases y by 1, so I need at least 9 turns to go from 0 to 9.\n\nBut since I can only move one per turn, from y=0 to y=9, min 9 moves up, so min 9 turns after start, but I have to reach exactly.\n\nLet me define the state.\n\nAt turn t (relative), position y_t.\n\nStart: t=0, y=0\n\nAfter H turns, at turn H, y_H =9.\n\nH is the number of actions, from t=0 to t=H-1, and y at t=H is the position after H actions.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from t=0 to H-1, position at t=H is final.\n\nMinimal H such that y_H=9.\n\nSince I need to increase y from 0 to 9, and each U increases by 1, each S or D doesn't increase, so minimal H is 9, if I go up every turn.\n\nBut I might need to wait or detour, so H could be more.\n\nIn this case, if I can avoid the collision times, I might do it in H=9.\n\nBut at t=2, if I am on y=1-5, collision.\n\nWith H=9, at t=0 to t=8, actions, y at t=9.\n\nIf I go up every turn, y_t = t for t=0 to 9? At t=0, y=0\n\nAfter action U at t=0, y1=1\n\nU at t=1, y2=2\n\nU at t=2, y3=3\n\n...\n\nU at t=8, y9=9\n\nNow, at which turns am I on which y.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nt=0: y=0, safe\n\nt=1: y=1, which is not occupied at t=1 (only at t=2 for y=1), so safe\n\nt=2: y=2, occupied at t=2, collision! Not good.\n\nSo cannot go straight up in 9 turns because at t=2, y=2 is occupied.\n\nI need to be not on y=1-5 at t=2.\n\nAt t=2, I must be on y=0 or y=6,7,8,9.\n\nBut at t=2, I have just started, y=0 or 1 or 2, etc., I can't be at y=6 yet.\n\nSince I start at y=0, at t=0.\n\nAfter 2 actions (t=0 and t=1), I can be at most y=2, if I go up twice.\n\ny_t at t=2: after two actions.\n\nAt t=0, action, y1 set.\n\nAt t=1, action, y2 set.\n\nSo y2 can be 0,1, or 2.\n\nCannot be higher than 2.\n\nSimilarly, y2 must be 0,1, or 2.\n\nBut at t=2, y=1 or 2 is occupied if on freeway 1-5, which they are.\n\ny=0 is safe, y=1 and 2 are occupied at t=2.\n\nSo only possible to be at y=0 at t=2 to avoid collision.\n\nSimilarly, for y=3,4,5, same, but I can't reach them yet.\n\nSo at t=2, I must be on y=0.\n\nThen, after that, I can go up.\n\nNow, to be at y=0 at t=2.\n\nStart at t=0, y=0.\n\nAction at t=0: if I choose S or D, y1=0 (S) or y1= -1, but y cannot below 0, so if choose D, y1 = max(0, y0 -1) = max(0,-1)=0? y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, and y in [0,9], so if y_t=0 and choose D, y_{t+1} = 0, since cannot go below.\n\nSimilarly, if y_t=9 and choose U, y_{t+1}=9.\n\nSo at t=0, y=0.\n\nI can choose:\n\n- U: y1=1\n\n- S: y1=0\n\n- D: y1=0\n\nSo if I choose U, y1=1\n\nThen at t=1, y=1.\n\nNow to have y2=0.\n\nAt t=1, y=1, I choose D, then y2 = y1 -1 = 1-1=0.\n\nChoose S, y2=1.\n\nChoose U, y2=2.\n\nSo to have y2=0, I must choose D at t=1.\n\nIf at t=0 I choose S or D, y1=0.\n\nThen at t=1, y=0, I can choose S or D to have y2=0.\n\nSo possible to be at y=0 at t=2.\n\nFor example:\n\nOption: at t=0, choose S, then y1=0\n\nAt t=1, choose S, then y2=0\n\nAt t=2, on y=0, safe.\n\nThen from here, I need to go to y=9.\n\nSince after t=2, all clear, I can go up every turn.\n\nStart from t=2, y=0.\n\nAction at t=2: U, y3=1\n\nt=3: U, y4=2\n\n...\n\nUp to t=10: U, y11=9? Let's see.\n\nAt t=2, y=0\n\nAfter action at t=2: U, y3=1\n\nt=3: U, y4=2\n\nt=4: U, y5=3\n\nt=5: U, y6=4\n\nt=6: U, y7=5\n\nt=7: U, y8=6\n\nt=8: U, y9=7\n\nt=9: U, y10=8\n\nt=10: U, y11=9\n\nSo at t=11, y=9.\n\nH is the number of actions, from t=0 to t=H-1, and y at t=H.\n\nHere, actions from t=0 to t=10, that's 11 actions? t from 0 to 10 inclusive is 11 actions.\n\ny at t=11=9.\n\nBut H is such that actions from t=0 to H-1, position at t=H.\n\nSo if y_H =9, with H=11.\n\nBut t=H is the turn index.\n\nIn this case, with 11 actions: from t=0 to t=10, 11 steps, y at t=11.\n\nBut minimal H should be less.\n\nI stayed two turns at start, but I could move up earlier.\n\nAt t=0, I could go to y=1, but then at t=1, I need to go down to y=0 at t=2.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt t=0, choose U, y1=1\n\nAt t=1, choose D, y2=0\n\nThen at t=2, y=0, safe.\n\nThen same as before, from y=0 at t=2, go up to y=9 at t=11.\n\nSame H=11.\n\nBut I can go up faster after t=2.\n\nBut from y=0 to y=9, I need 9 up moves, so at least 9 actions, but since I start moving from t=2, the earliest to reach y=9 is at t=11, with y at t=0 to t=2 at 0 or something.\n\nt=2 y=0, then after 9 up moves, at t=11 y=9.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut perhaps I can be on higher y at t=2.\n\nAt t=2, I must be on y=0, as we said, since y=1 or 2 occupied, and I can't be higher.\n\ny=6 or7, but I can't reach at t=2.\n\nWith two actions, from y=0, I can be y=0,1, or 2.\n\nNo higher, so must be y=0 at t=2.\n\nSo H=11 seems necessary with this.\n\nBut H=11 means 11 actions, from t=0 to t=10, y at t=11.\n\nBut perhaps I can reach earlier by using the safe lanes.\n\nAnother idea: go to y=6 or y=7 quickly, but y=6 and y=7 are always safe, but I need to go through y=1 to 5 to reach them.\n\nBut at t=2, y=1-5 are occupied, so I cannot be on them at that turn.\n\nBut I can be on them at other turns.\n\nFor example, at t=0, I am on y=0.\n\nI can go to y=1 at t=1.\n\nAt t=1, y=1 is safe, since not occupied.\n\nThen at t=1, I can choose to go to y=2, but at t=2, y=2 would be occupied if I am there.\n\nBut I can stay or go down.\n\nBut I need to go up.\n\nAt t=1, I am on y=1, I can choose S, then y2=1, but at t=2, y=1 occupied, collision.\n\nChoose D, y2=0, same as before.\n\nBut I can go to y=1 at t=1, then at t=1, since I am on y=1, and it is safe at t=1, but for the next action.\n\nAnother thought: I can move faster before or after.\n\nBut at t=2, I must avoid y=1-5.\n\nSince y=6 and y=7 are safe, if I can be on y=6 or 7 at t=2, but I can't, because from t=0, in two moves, max y=2.\n\nSo impossible to be on y=6 at t=2.\n\nTherefore, only choice is to be on y=0 at t=2.\n\nThen proceed up.\n\nBut H=11 seems long.\n\nPerhaps I can start moving after t=2, but same.\n\nAnother thing: I can go down to y=0 at t=2, but I was already there.\n\nOr, I can be on y=8 or 9 at t=2, but impossible.\n\nSo I think H=11 is the minimal with this constraint.\n\nBut let's confirm the occupied times.\n\nAt t=2, y=1-5 occupied, and I must be on y=0 or above 5, but above 5 not possible, so y=0.\n\nThen from there, 9 up moves to y=9 at t=11.\n\nBut t=11 relative to start, so T=34 + 11 = 45.\n\nBut let's see if I can save time by using y=6 or 7 earlier, but I need to reach them first.\n\nFor example, if I could be on y=6 at t=3 or something.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nSince after t=2, all clear, I can go directly.\n\nBut from t=0 to t=2, I need to stay at y=0.\n\nActions: at t=0, I must choose S or D to keep y1=0.\n\nSimilarly at t=1, choose S or D to keep y2=0.\n\nThen from t=2 to t=10, choose U each time to increase to y=9 at t=11.\n\ny at t=11=9.\n\nH=11 actions: from t=0 to t=10.\n\nBut the turn indices: at turn T=34 (t=0), position y=0.\n\nAfter action a_{34}, y at T=35 is set, and so on.\n\nIn the sequence, actions for turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nHere t1=34.\n\nSo actions for turn 34, 35, ..., up to turn 34 + H -1.\n\nAnd at turn 34 + H, position is (0,9).\n\nWith H=11, actions from turn 34 to 44, position at turn 45 is (0,9).\n\nBut perhaps I can do better.\n\nAnother idea: at t=0, I am on y=0.\n\nI can go to y=1 at t=1 (by U at t=0).\n\nThen at t=1, I am on y=1, which is safe at t=1.\n\nNow, instead of going down, I can go to y=2 at t=2, but y=2 occupied at t=2, not possible.\n\nUnless I can be on y=2 before or after, but at t=2 it is occupied.\n\nI could go directly to y=6, but I need to pass through y=2,3,4,5.\n\nFor example, if I go up to y=1 at t=1, then at t=1, I choose to go to y=2 at t=2, but at t=2 y=2 occupied.\n\nNot possible.\n\nAt t=1, I stay at y=1, but at t=2 y=1 occupied.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo I think I have to avoid being on y=1-5 at t=2.\n\nAnd since I can't be above, I must be at y=0.\n\nBut what about y=8 or 9? No.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=8 at t=2, but impossible.\n\nAnother thought: y=8 is occupied at t=0 and t=1, but at t=2 it is free.\n\nBut I am at y=0, not on y=8.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=8 quickly after t=2.\n\nBut I need to go through the lower levels.\n\nAfter t=2, I can go up fast.\n\nBut from y=0 at t=2 to y=9 at t=11.\n\nBut let's see if I can start moving earlier at some point.\n\nFor example, at t=0, I go to y=1 (U).\n\nThen at t=1, I go to y=0 (D), so at t=2 y=0.\n\nBut that's the same as before.\n\nAt t=0, I stay, y1=0.\n\nAt t=1, I go to y=1, but at t=2 y=1 occupied.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo no, I have to be at y=0 at t=2.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let's list the actions.\n\nActions for turns starting from t1=34.\n\nTurn 34: action a_{34}\n\nThen position at turn 35: y_{35} = y_{34} + Δy based on a_{34}\n\nIn the state, at turn 34, position (0,0), so y_{34} =0.\n\nThen after a_{34}, y_{35} is set.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nTo be at y=0 at turn 36 (t=2, T=36).\n\nTurn T=34, t=0, y=0\n\nT=35, t=1, y=?\n\nT=36, t=2, y= must be 0.\n\nThen T=37, t=3, y=?\n\netc.\n\nAt T=36, y=0.\n\nNow, to have y=0 at T=36.\n\ny at T=36 is set by action at T=35.\n\ny_{T} is position at turn T.\n\nAction at turn T affects y_{T+1}.\n\nAt turn T, I am at y_T, I choose action a_T, then y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy.\n\nFor T=34, y_{34} =0\n\nI choose a_{34}, then y_{35} = y_{34} + Δy\n\nThen at turn 35, I am at y_{35}, choose a_{35}, then y_{36} = y_{35} + Δy\n\nAt turn 36, I am at y_{36}, which we want to be 0.\n\nThen similarly.\n\nTo have y_{36} =0.\n\ny_{36} depends on y_{35} and a_{35}.\n\ny_{36} = y_{35} + Δy_{35}\n\nΔy based on a_{35}.\n\nTo have y_{36}=0, since y_{35} >=0, so if y_{35} =0 and a_{35} = S or D, then y_{36}=0.\n\nOr if y_{35}=1 and a_{35}=D, y_{36}=0.\n\ny_{35} cannot be negative.\n\nNow, similarly, y_{35} depends on previous.\n\nBut at T=35, turn t=1, if I am on y=1 to 7, it might be safe, but we need to reach y=9.\n\nBut for now, to have y_{36}=0.\n\nPossible ways:\n\n- If y_{35} =0, then choose a_{35}=S or D, y_{36}=0\n\n- If y_{35}=1, then choose a_{35}=D, y_{36}=0\n\ny_{35} cannot be 2 or more because if y_{35}=2, and I choose D, y_{36}=1, not 0; choose S, y_{36}=2; choose U, y_{36}=3, none 0.\n\nSimilarly, if y_{35}=0, I can get y_{36}=0.\n\nIf y_{35}=1, I can get y_{36}=0 by going down.\n\nNow, y_{35} is set by a_{34} and y_{34}.\n\ny_{34}=0\n\na_{34}:\n\n- U: y_{35}=1\n\n- S: y_{35}=0\n\n- D: y_{35}=0\n\nSo cases:\n\nIf at t=34, choose S or D, y_{35}=0\n\nThen to have y_{36}=0, at t=35, choose S or D.\n\nIf at t=34, choose U, y_{35}=1\n\nThen to have y_{36}=0, at t=35, choose D.\n\nIn both cases, I can have y_{36}=0.\n\nThen, after that, I need to go to y=9 as fast as possible.\n\nFrom y_{36}=0, at turn 36.\n\nThen I can choose U at turn 36, y_{37}=1\n\nU at 37, y_{38}=2\n\n...\nU at 44, y_{45}=9\n\ny_{36}=0\n\na_{36}=U, y_{37}=1\n\na_{37}=U, y_{38}=2\n\na_{38}=U, y_{39}=3\n\na_{39}=U, y_{40}=4\n\na_{40}=U, y_{41}=5\n\na_{41}=U, y_{42}=6\n\na_{42}=U, y_{43}=7\n\na_{43}=U, y_{44}=8\n\na_{44}=U, y_{45}=9\n\nSo at turn 45, y=9.\n\nActions from turn 34 to 44, that's 11 actions.\n\nH=11, turns from 34 to 44, position at 45.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions for t=34 to t=44.\n\nNow, is there a way to do it faster?\n\nSuppose at turn 36, y=0, but I could have been higher earlier, but I had to be at 0 at turn 36.\n\nFor example, if I go up at t=34 to y=1 at t=35.\n\nThen at t=35, I go down to y=0 at t=36.\n\nBut at t=35, I am on y=1, which is safe, since not occupied at t=1.\n\nThen at t=36, y=0.\n\nThen same as above.\n\nBut in this case, at t=35, I was at y=1, which is fine, but I didn't gain, since I went down.\n\nSo same number of steps.\n\nPerhaps after turn 36, I can go directly, but I need to cover 9 levels.\n\nAnother idea: use the fact that y=6 and y=7 are always safe, so I can go through them anytime.\n\nBut from y=0, I need to reach them.\n\nFor example, if I could be at y=6 at turn 36, but I can't, because from t=0 to t=2, only 2 moves, max y=2.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo I think H=11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's confirm if I can be on y=8 or 9 earlier by not starting from 0.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps I can avoid the critical turn by being on safe freeway.\n\nBut at t=2, only y=0,6,7,8,9 are safe, but y=6,7,8,9 unreachable at t=2 from start.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, for the sequence, I need to specify actions.\n\nI can choose different actions as long as I end at y=0 at turn 36.\n\nFor example, one sequence:\n\nTurn 34: S (stay, y35=0)\n\nTurn 35: S (y36=0)\n\nThen Turn 36: U (y37=1)\n\nTurn 37: U (y38=2)\n\nTurn 38: U (y39=3)\n\nTurn 39: U (y40=4)\n\nTurn 40: U (y41=5)\n\nTurn 41: U (y42=6)\n\nTurn 42: U (y43=7)\n\nTurn 43: U (y44=8)\n\nTurn 44: U (y45=9)\n\nActions from turn 34 to 44, that's 11 actions: turns 34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44.\n\nPosition at turn 45 is (0,9).\n\nIn the sequence, actions for turn t1 to t1+H-1, with H=11, so turns 34 to 44.\n\nIn the answer, it should be:\n\nTurn 34: S\n\nTurn 35: S\n\nTurn 36: U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn 44: U\n\nBut I could have different actions for the first two turns.\n\nFor example, turn 34: U (to y35=1)\n\nTurn 35: D (to y36=0)\n\nThen same from turn 36: U, etc.\n\nBut at turn 35, when I go down to y=0, I am on y=1 at turn 35, which is safe.\n\nThen turn 36: U to y=1, and so on.\n\nIn both cases, same length.\n\nPerhaps I can move up during the safe periods.\n\nBut before turn 36, at t=0 and t=1, I can be on y=1, but I have to go down to y=0 at t=2.\n\nFor example, at turn 34: U, to y35=1\n\nThen at turn 35: I am on y=1, which is safe, but I choose D, to y36=0.\n\nIf I choose U at turn 35, y36=2, but at turn 36, y=2 occupied, collision.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo I have to go to y=0 at turn 36.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let's double-check the car positions to make sure.\n\nAt turn 36, T=36, which is t=2.\n\nFor freeway 1: car at [48-36*2, 83-36*2] = [48-72,83-72] = [-24,11], 0 in it.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nAnd at other turns, for example at turn 35, T=35, t=1.\n\nFreeway 1: [48-36,83-36]=[12,47], 0 not in.\n\nFreeway 8: car (0,-11,right,6), at T=35, t=1, [ -11+6, 0+6] = [-5,6], 0 in it.\n\nBut y=8 occupied at T=35, but if I am not on it, no problem.\n\nIn my sequence, when I am at y=1 at turn 35, it is safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 faster by going through y=6 or 7 without delay, but I need to avoid t=2 on low y.\n\nFor example, suppose I go up to y=1 at turn 35.\n\nBut at turn 36, I need to be not on 1-5, so if I could be on y=6 at turn 36, but I can't.\n\nAnother idea: what if I go up multiple times before t=2, but I can only reach y=2 at turn 36 if I go up twice, but y=2 occupied.\n\nNot possible.\n\nPerhaps after turn 36, since y=6 and 7 are safe, I can go directly, but from y=0, I need to go through 1,2,3,4,5, which after t=2 are safe.\n\nIn the sequence above, from turn 36 to 44, I go through all levels.\n\nBut since y=6 and 7 are safe, I don't need to worry, but I still need to pass through the lower ones to reach them.\n\nUnless I start from higher, but I start from 0.\n\nSo I think 11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's see the answer format.\n\nI need to output the sequence.\n\nIn the sequence I have, with H=11.\n\nBut in the first two turns, I can choose S or U and D.\n\nTo minimize actions, but all same.\n\nPerhaps I can go down or something, but not useful.\n\nAnother thought: at turn 34, I start at y=0.\n\nIf I choose nothing, but I have to choose action.\n\nPerhaps I can be on y=9 at an earlier turn if I move faster, but I can't because of the constraint.\n\nFor example, if no cars, I could reach at turn 43 with y=9, since from turn 34: U, y35=1; U y36=2; ... U y43=9, so at turn 43, with actions from 34 to 42, 9 actions, H=9.\n\nBut with cars, at turn 36, if y=2, occupied, so I have to delay.\n\nIn my case, I have two extra turns of waiting or moving down.\n\nSo H=11.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=8 or 9 directly, but no, only one step per turn.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nNow, for the sequence, let's write it.\n\nI'll choose one with staying.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 34: S  // stay, y35=0\n\nTurn 35: S  // stay, y36=0\n\nTurn 36: U  // up, y37=1\n\nTurn 37: U  // y38=2\n\nTurn 38: U  // y39=3\n\nTurn 39: U  // y40=4\n\nTurn 40: U  // y41=5\n\nTurn 41: U  // y42=6\n\nTurn 42: U  // y43=7\n\nTurn 43: U  // y44=8\n\nTurn 44: U  // y45=9\n\nSo actions from turn 34 to 44.\n\nIn the box, it should be:\n\nTurn 34: S\n\nTurn 35: S\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: U\n\nBut in the sequence, after turn 44 action U, position at turn 45 is y=9.\n\nNow, H=11, turns from 34 to 44.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 8 at turn 34 and 35.\n\nAt turn 34, y=8 occupied, but I am at y=0, not on it.\n\nSimilarly at turn 35, I am at y=0 or 1, not on y=8.\n\nIn the sequence above, at turn 35, if I stay, y=0.\n\nAt turn 36, y=0.\n\nThen from turn 36 to 44, I go up.\n\nBut at turn 41, y42=6, freeway 6, which is always safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nI could choose to go up and down, but no benefit.\n\nSo this should be minimal.\n\nBut in the beginning, I used two S, but I could use U and D.\n\nFor example:\n\nTurn 34: U  // to y=1 at turn 35\n\nTurn 35: D  // to y=0 at turn 36\n\nThen same as before.\n\nBut in this case, at turn 35, I am on y=1, which is fine.\n\nThen turn 36: U, etc.\n\nSame length.\n\nI think either is fine.\n\nI'll go with the first one for simplicity.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nAlso, for freeway 8, at turn 34, there is a car with head at 0, tail at -11, so at x=0, it is occupied.\n\nBut since I am not on y=8, no collision.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 34\\) is 11. This sequence avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by ensuring the player is not on any occupied freeway at critical turns.\n\n- At turn \\(t = 2\\) (relative to \\(t_1\\), corresponding to absolute turn \\(T = 36\\), freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 5\\) are occupied, so the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) to avoid collision.\n- Freeway \\(y = 8\\) is occupied at turns \\(T = 34\\) and \\(T = 35\\) (relative \\(t = 0\\) and \\(t = 1\\)), but the player starts at \\(y = 0\\) and remains at low \\(y\\) during these turns, avoiding collision.\n- After turn \\(T = 36\\), all freeways are safe, allowing the player to move up freely to \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is chosen to stay at \\(y = 0\\) until turn \\(T = 36\\) (by choosing \"S\" at turns 34 and 35), then move up (\"U\") each turn to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 45.\n\n**Action Sequence (from turn 34 to turn 44):**\n\n- Turn 34: S (stay at \\(y = 0\\) for turn 35)\n- Turn 35: S (stay at \\(y = 0\\) for turn 36)\n- Turn 36: U (move to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 37)\n- Turn 37: U (move to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 38)\n- Turn 38: U (move to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 39)\n- Turn 39: U (move to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 40)\n- Turn 40: U (move to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 41)\n- Turn 41: U (move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 42)\n- Turn 42: U (move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 43)\n- Turn 43: U (move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 44)\n- Turn 44: U (move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 45)\n\nAt turn 45, the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 34: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 35: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 36: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 37: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 38: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 39: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 40: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 41: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 42: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 43: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 44: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) at turn 35 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to 8. The cars move predictably based on their speed and direction.\n\nFirst, I should understand where the cars are at any given turn, especially when I might be on their freeway. Collision happens only if I'm on the same freeway y at turn T and 0 is within the car's span at that exact turn.\n\nThe player position updates based on actions: U for up, D for down, S for stay. y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t being +1, -1, or 0 for U, D, S respectively. And y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nI start at y=0 at turn 35. I need to reach y=9.\n\nThe minimal H would be at least 9 if I go up every turn, but cars might block me, so I might need to wait or go down sometimes.\n\nSince I start at y=0 and need to get to y=9, and cars are on y=1 to 8, I need to cross each freeway safely.\n\nBut I don't have to go through each row; I can skip some if I move multiple steps, but since I can only change by 1 each turn, I must pass through each y from 0 to 9, but y=0 and y=9 are safe, I think, since no cars there. y=0 is the starting point, and y=9 is the goal, no cars on those, I assume. The freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe.\n\nCollision only on freeways y=1 to 8 when on that y at turn T.\n\nNow, let's list the car states at turn t1=35.\n\nFor each freeway k, there are cars with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: left or right. Left-moving means decreasing x, right-moving means increasing x.\n\nThe span is given, and for left-moving, head is larger, I think? Let's see the notation.\n\nFor left-moving: at turn t1, span is [h, τ], and h > τ, I assume, since it's moving left, so head is on the right.\n\nIn the update: for left-moving, Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the car state table, for left-moving, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For left, head should be the right end, tail left end, so [tail, head] or [head, tail]?\n\nLet's clarify the span notation.\n\nIn the update for left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nSince it's moving left, decreasing x, so if [h, τ] at t1, with h > τ, then at T, [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so the interval shifts left.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], so τ < h, and it shifts right.\n\nIn the car state, for left-moving, it's given as (head, tail, left, speed). But in the span, for left, it's [h, τ], so head is the larger number, tail smaller.\n\nFor example, freeway 1: (12, 47, left, 36) — 12 and 47? 12 to 47? But if direction left, and head is 47, tail 12? That doesn't make sense because if head is 47, tail 12, and left direction, it should be moving left, so head should decrease.\n\nI think there might be inconsistency.\n\nLook at freeway 1: (12, 47, left, 36)\n\nIf direction left, and span at t1 is [h, τ], with h and τ, but which is head and tail?\n\nIn the update, for left-moving, it says \"head is at h, tail at τ\", and Span(t1) = [h, τ], and then [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT].\n\nBut if direction is left, and it's moving left, the head should be the front when moving, so for left-moving, head should be the right end, so larger x, tail left end smaller x.\n\nBut here (12, 47, left, 36), 12 and 47, so if h=12, τ=47, then [12,47], but 12<47, so if it's [h,τ] with h=12, τ=47, then [12,47], and moving left, so at T, [12 - sΔT, 47 - sΔT], which would make the left end smaller, but since it's moving left, the car is shifting to lower x.\n\nBut the span [12,47] at t1, with s=36, moving left.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, it's (τ, h) or something? Let's see.\n\nIn the table, for right-moving, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed), but in the update, for right-moving, it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" → [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nSo for right-moving, at t1, it's [τ, h], with τ and h, and τ < h, I assume.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 3, for example: (60, 49, right, 12) — 60 and 49, but if it's [τ, h], with τ=60, h=49? 60>49, that can't be, because τ should be less than h for [τ,h].\n\nI think there's a mistake in the notation or my understanding.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nFor car on freeway i, at turn t1, head at h, tail at τ.\n\nThen for left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nFor this to make sense, if moving left, head should be larger than tail, so h > τ, and [h, τ] would be from τ to h, but [h,τ] with h>τ is decreasing, but in interval notation, [a,b] with a>b is unusual; usually [min,max].\n\nPerhaps it's a typo or misnomer.\n\nIn the text: \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" for left-moving, and then it shifts left.\n\nBut if h and τ, with for example freeway 1: (12,47,left,36), so h=12, τ=47, so [12,47], but 12<47, so [12,47], and moving left, so at T, [12 - 36ΔT, 47 - 36ΔT].\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" for right-moving.\n\nFor freeway 3: (60,49,right,12), so for right-moving, [τ, h] = [60,49]? But 60>49, so [49,60]? It's messy.\n\nI think I need to interpret the span based on direction.\n\nPerhaps \"head\" and \"tail\" are defined relative to direction.\n\nFor left-moving, head is the front, which is left end? No.\n\nLet's think physically.\n\nWhen a car is moving left, its front (head) is at the smaller x if x decreases left, but in grid, usually x increases right, so moving left, x decreases, so head has smaller x? I'm confused.\n\nAssume x-axis: smaller x left, larger x right.\n\nIf car moving left, direction left, then its front (head) is at smaller x, and rear (tail) at larger x.\n\nFor example, car spanning from x=10 to x=20, moving left, head at x=10, tail at x=20.\n\nThen at time t, position: head at h, tail at τ, with h < τ.\n\nThen at time T, head at h - sΔT, tail at τ - sΔT.\n\nSpan: [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nSimilarly, for moving right, head at larger x, tail at smaller x.\n\nFor spanning from x=10 to x=20 moving right, head at 20, tail at 10.\n\nAt T, head at 10 + sΔT, tail at 20 + sΔT? No.\n\nIf tail at smaller x, head at larger x.\n\nAt t1, tail at τ, head at h, with τ < h.\n\nAt T, tail at τ + sΔT, head at h + sΔT, span [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nIn the problem text, for left-moving, it says \"head at h, tail at τ\" and Span(t1) = [h, τ], which for moving left, h should be less than τ, so [h,τ] with h<τ, meaning from h to τ.\n\nIn freeway 1: (12,47,left,36), so h=12, τ=47, so head at 12, tail at 47, span [12,47], moving left.\n\nAt T, [12 - 36ΔT, 47 - 36ΔT]\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, \"head at h, tail at τ\", and Span(t1) = [τ, h], which for moving right, τ should be less than h, so [τ,h] with τ<h.\n\nIn freeway 3: (60,49,right,12), but 60>49, so if it's (head, tail), for right-moving, head should be larger, so h=60, τ=49? But in the tuple it's (60,49,right,12), and for right-moving, Span(t1) = [τ, h] = [49,60]? But the values are 60 and 49, so if it's (head,tail), head=60, tail=49, so for right-moving, τ=tail=49, h=head=60, so [τ,h] = [49,60].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn freeway 3, it's (60,49,right,12), so head=60, tail=49, so for right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h] = [49,60].\n\nThen at T, [49 + 12ΔT, 60 + 12ΔT]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, like freeway 1: (12,47,left,36), head=12, tail=47, span [12,47], at T [12-36ΔT, 47-36ΔT]\n\nNow, collision occurs if at turn T, I am on freeway y_T, and 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nAlso, note that when I move, at turn T, I am on y_T, and after action, I move to y_{T+1} at the next turn, so at turn T, I am only on y_T, not on y_{T+1} yet.\n\nSo for collision, only need to worry about the freeway I am on at each turn.\n\nNow, I need to find a sequence of actions from turn 35 onwards to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nStart at turn 35, y=0.\n\nI need to get to y=9.\n\nMinimal turns if no cars: 9 turns, all U, from turn 35 to 43, y from 0 to 9.\n\nBut cars might be at x=0 when I am on their row.\n\nSo I need to check for each row, at what turns x=0 is not occupied by a car on that row.\n\nSince cars move continuously, I need to find times when for a given row, at turn T, 0 not in the span of any car on that row.\n\nAlso, multiple cars on some rows.\n\nLet me list the cars for each freeway at turn t1=35.\n\nFreeway 1 (y=1): one car: left-moving, head=12, tail=47, speed=36, so span at t1: [12,47]\n\nSince moving left, at time T, span: [12 - 36(T-35), 47 - 36(T-35)]\n\nCollision if I am on y=1 at turn T and 0 in [12-36ΔT, 47-36ΔT] where ΔT = T-35.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 (y=2): same as y=1? (12,47,left,36), so identical to y=1.\n\nFreeway 2: also (12,47,left,36), so same as y=1.\n\nFreeway 3 (y=3): three cars: (60,49,right,12), (24,13,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nFor right-moving, each has head and tail.\n\nFirst car: (60,49,right,12), so head=60, tail=49, so at t1, span [τ,h] = [49,60]\n\nAt T, [49 +12ΔT, 60+12ΔT]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (24,13,right,12), head=24? Tail=13? (24,13,right,12), so for right-moving, head=24, tail=13, span at t1 [13,24]\n\nAt T [13+12ΔT, 24+12ΔT]\n\nThird car: (-12,-23,right,12), head=-12, tail=-23, so tail=-23, head=-12, span at t1 [-23,-12]\n\nAt T [-23+12ΔT, -12+12ΔT]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 (y=4): same as y=3, three cars: (60,49,right,12), (24,13,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nFreeway 5 (y=5): same, (60,49,right,12), (24,13,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nFreeway 6 (y=6): one car: (54,43,right,6), so head=54, tail=43, right-moving, span at t1 [43,54]\n\nAt T [43+6ΔT, 54+6ΔT]\n\nFreeway 7 (y=7): same as y=6, (54,43,right,6)\n\nFreeway 8 (y=8): two cars: (54,43,right,6) and (6,-5,right,6)\n\nFirst car: (54,43,right,6), span at t1 [43,54], at T [43+6ΔT, 54+6ΔT]\n\nSecond car: (6,-5,right,6), head=6, tail=-5, so span at t1 [-5,6], at T [-5+6ΔT, 6+6ΔT]\n\nNow, I need to find for each freeway, the times when 0 is not covered by any car, i.e., for which T, 0 not in the span of any car on that row.\n\nSince collision only when on that row at that turn.\n\nFor freeway y=1: one car, span at T: [12 - 36ΔT, 47 - 36ΔT] with ΔT = T-35\n\n0 in span if 12 - 36ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 47 - 36ΔT\n\nSince the span is [low, high] with low = 12 - 36ΔT, high = 47 - 36ΔT\n\nlow <= 0 <= high\n\nSo 12 - 36ΔT <= 0 and 0 <= 47 - 36ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: 12 - 36ΔT <= 0 => 12 <= 36ΔT => ΔT >= 12/36 = 1/3, so T >= 35 + 1/3, since T integer, T >= 36\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 47 - 36ΔT => 36ΔT <= 47 => ΔT <= 47/36 ≈ 1.305, so ΔT <= 1 since integer, T <= 35 + 1 = 36? ΔT <= 47/36 ≈ 1.305, so for integer ΔT, ΔT <= 1, so T <= 36\n\nΔT = T-35, integer.\n\nFrom first: ΔT >= ceil(1/3) = 1? 12 - 36ΔT <=0 => 36ΔT >=12 => ΔT >= 12/36 = 1/3, since ΔT integer, ΔT >=1\n\nFrom second: 0 <= 47 - 36ΔT => 36ΔT <=47 => ΔT <= 47/36 ≈1.305, so ΔT <=1\n\nThus, for ΔT=1, both satisfied: 12-36(1) =12-36= -24 <=0, 47-36=11 >=0, so 0 in [-24,11]? low =12-36ΔT, for ΔT=1, low=12-36= -24, high=47-36=11, so [-24,11], 0 is in it.\n\nFor ΔT=0, low=12, high=47, 0 not in [12,47]\n\nFor ΔT=1, low=-24, high=11, 0 in [-24,11]\n\nFor ΔT=2, low=12-72= -60, high=47-72= -25, [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSo only for ΔT=1, i.e., T=36, 0 is in the span for y=1.\n\nFor T=35, not; T=36, yes; T=37 and after, no.\n\nΔT=1, T=36.\n\nSo for freeway y=1, collision at T=36 if on it.\n\nAt other times, no collision possible.\n\nSimilarly, for y=2, same as y=1, since same car configuration, so also collision only at T=36.\n\nNow freeway y=3: three cars.\n\nFirst car: right-moving, span at T: [49 +12ΔT, 60+12ΔT]\n\n0 in this span if 49 +12ΔT <= 0 <= 60+12ΔT\n\nBut 49+12ΔT >=49>0 for ΔT>=0, so 0 <= 60+12ΔT always true since 60+12ΔT>0, but 49+12ΔT <=0? 49+12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <= -49, impossible since ΔT>=0. So 0 never in this span. Similarly, high=60+12ΔT>0, low=49+12ΔT>0, so 0 not in [49+12ΔT,60+12ΔT] for any ΔT.\n\nSecond car: [13+12ΔT, 24+12ΔT], all positive for ΔT>=0, so 0 not in.\n\nThird car: [-23+12ΔT, -12+12ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -23+12ΔT <= 0 <= -12+12ΔT\n\nFirst: -23+12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <=23 => ΔT <= 23/12 ≈1.916, so ΔT <=1\n\nSecond: 0 <= -12+12ΔT => 12 <=12ΔT => ΔT >=1\n\nThus for ΔT=1, both: -23+12= -11 <=0, -12+12=0 <=0? 0 <= 0 is true.\n\nSo at ΔT=1, T=36, span [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], so 0 is included.\n\nFor other ΔT, not.\n\nΔT=1: low=-23+12= -11, high=-12+12=0, so [ -11, 0 ], 0 is the upper bound, so included, I assume closed interval.\n\nSimilarly, for ΔT=0: [-23,-12], 0 not in\n\nΔT=2: [-23+24, -12+24]= [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at T=36, for the third car, 0 is in span.\n\nNow, are there other cars? First and second cars don't cover 0, so on y=3, collision at T=36 only.\n\nSimilarly for y=4, same as y=3, so collision at T=36.\n\ny=5 same, collision at T=36.\n\nNow y=6: one car, (54,43,right,6), span at T: [43+6ΔT, 54+6ΔT]\n\nAll positive, min at ΔT=0, 43>0, so 0 never in span. No collision possible on y=6 at any time.\n\nSimilarly y=7: same as y=6, no collision possible.\n\ny=8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (54,43,right,6), same as above, [43+6ΔT,54+6ΔT] >0, no 0.\n\nSecond car: (6,-5,right,6), span at T: [-5+6ΔT, 6+6ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -5+6ΔT <= 0 <= 6+6ΔT\n\nFirst: -5+6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=5 => ΔT <= 5/6 ≈0.833, so ΔT=0\n\nSecond: 0 <= 6+6ΔT always true for ΔT>=0\n\nAt ΔT=0, T=35, low=-5, high=6, so [-5,6], 0 in it.\n\nFor ΔT=1, T=36, low=-5+6=1, high=6+6=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nΔT=2, [7,18], etc.\n\nSo only at T=35, for the second car, 0 in span.\n\nBut at T=35, for y=8.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway when collision occurs, i.e., when 0 is covered:\n\n- y=1: T=36\n\n- y=2: T=36\n\n- y=3: T=36\n\n- y=4: T=36\n\n- y=5: T=36\n\n- y=6: never\n\n- y=7: never\n\n- y=8: T=35\n\ny=8 collision at T=35, which is turn 35.\n\nBut at turn 35, I am at y=0, not on y=8, so for me, when I am on y=8, I need to avoid T where collision.\n\nNow, I need to plan my path.\n\nI start at turn 35, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9.\n\nThe critical point is that at turn 36, y=1,2,3,4,5 all have collision, so I cannot be on any of y=1 to 5 at turn 36.\n\ny=1 to 5 all unsafe at T=36.\n\ny=6 and y=7 always safe.\n\ny=8 unsafe at T=35, but since I start from below, when I go to y=8, it might be later.\n\nNow, turn 35: I am at y=0.\n\nI can choose action: U, D, or S.\n\nIf I go U, to y=1 at turn 36.\n\nBut at turn 36, y=1 has collision, so if I am on y=1 at turn 36, I collide.\n\nSimilarly, if I stay S, at y=0, but y=0 is not a freeway, no cars, so safe, but I need to move up eventually.\n\nIf I go D, to y=-1? But y must be in [0,9], so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, and y in [0,9], so if y_t=0, D would make y_{t+1}=-1, invalid, so I cannot go below 0, similarly above 9.\n\nSo at y=0, possible actions: U or S, not D.\n\nSimilarly at y=9, D or S, not U.\n\nAt turn 35, y=0, actions: U or S.\n\nIf I do S, stay at y=0 for turn 36.\n\nThen at turn 36, I am still at y=0.\n\nThen I can act for turn 37.\n\nIf I do U at turn 35, I go to y=1 at turn 36, but collision, so I must avoid that.\n\nTherefore, at turn 35, I should not go U, because next turn I would be on y=1 at T=36, collision.\n\nSo I must do S at turn 35.\n\nThen at turn 36, I am at y=0.\n\nNow turn 36: I am at y=0, can do U or S.\n\nIf I do U, to y=1 at turn 37.\n\nNow, at turn 37, what about the freeways?\n\nFirst, for y=1: we saw that collision only at T=36, so at T=37, no collision for y=1.\n\nSimilarly for y=2,3,4,5: all had collision only at T=36, so for T>36, no collision on y=1 to 5? Let's confirm.\n\nFor y=1: collision only at T=36, as we saw.\n\nSimilarly y=2 same.\n\ny=3: only T=36 for the third car.\n\ny=4,5 same.\n\ny=6 and 7 always safe.\n\ny=8: collision at T=35, which is past, so for T>35, no collision on y=8.\n\nAt T=36, y=8: from earlier, for second car, at ΔT=1, T=36, span [1,12], 0 not in, so safe at T=36 and after.\n\nSimilarly, only unsafe at T=35 for y=8.\n\nSo after turn 36, all freeways are safe at all times? Let's see.\n\nFor y=1: only unsafe at T=36, safe otherwise.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\ny=6 and 7 always safe.\n\ny=8 unsafe only at T=35.\n\nSo for turns after 36, all y=1 to 8 are safe.\n\nAt turn 36, if I were on y=1, it would be unsafe, but I am at y=0.\n\nNow at turn 36, I am at y=0, I can go U to y=1 at turn 37.\n\nTurn 37: I arrive at y=1, and since T=37>36, y=1 is safe, no car at x=0.\n\nSimilarly, I can keep going up.\n\nBut I need to reach y=9.\n\nFrom turn 36, I am at y=0.\n\nIf I do U at turn 36, I go to y=1 at turn 37.\n\nThen at turn 37, I am at y=1, can do U to y=2 at turn 38, and so on.\n\nSince all freeways are safe after turn 36, I can go up directly.\n\nBut let's confirm the times.\n\nStart: turn 35, y=0, I do S, so stay at y=0.\n\nTurn 36: at y=0, I do U, go to y=1 at turn 37.\n\nTurn 37: at y=1, do U, go to y=2 at turn 38.\n\nTurn 38: at y=2, U to y=3 at 39.\n\nTurn 39: at y=3, U to y=4 at 40.\n\nTurn 40: at y=4, U to y=5 at 41.\n\nTurn 41: at y=5, U to y=6 at 42.\n\nTurn 42: at y=6, U to y=7 at 43.\n\nTurn 43: at y=7, U to y=8 at 44.\n\nTurn 44: at y=8, U to y=9 at 45.\n\nNow at turn 45, y=9, which is the goal.\n\nBut is y=8 safe at turn 44?\n\nTurn 44, for y=8: at T=44, which is after 35, ΔT=44-35=9.\n\nFor y=8, second car: span at T: [-5+6ΔT, 6+6ΔT]\n\nAt ΔT=9, low= -5+54=49, high=6+54=60, [49,60], 0 not in, safe.\n\nFirst car also safe.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nNow, I reached y=9 at turn 45.\n\nBut is this minimal?\n\nI started at turn 35, y=0.\n\nIf no delay, I could be at y=9 at turn 44: turn 35 y=0, 36 y=1, ..., 44 y=9.\n\nBut at turn 36, if I were on y=1, it would be collision, so I had to wait one turn.\n\nSo with one wait, I reached at turn 45.\n\nCan I reach earlier?\n\nSuppose at turn 35, instead of S, I do nothing else, but I have to S.\n\nPerhaps I can go up later but skip some, but I have to go through each y.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6 and y=7 are always safe, I could go directly to them if possible, but I start from y=0, and can only move one step at a time.\n\nFor example, at turn 35, I stay, y=0.\n\nThen turn 36, instead of going to y=1, I could stay again, but that would delay more.\n\nOr go up later.\n\nBut with above, I go up from turn 36 to 44, reaching y=9 at 45.\n\nTurn 36: I am at y=0, after S at 35.\n\nAt turn 36, I do U, to y=1 at 37.\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 44: at y=8, U to y=9 at 45.\n\nYes.\n\nCan I reach at turn 44?\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn 44, I need to be at y=8 at turn 43, y=7 at 42, etc., down to y=0 at turn 35.\n\nAt turn 36, I need to be at y=1 to reach y=2 at 37, ..., y=9 at 44.\n\nBut at turn 36, if I am at y=1, collision, impossible.\n\nSimilarly, if I am at y=1 at any other time, but only unsafe at T=36, so if I could be at y=1 at T=37, which is safe.\n\nBut to reach y=9 at turn 44, I need to be at y=1 at turn 36, which is unsafe.\n\nTherefore, I cannot be at y=1 at turn 36, so I cannot reach y=9 by turn 44.\n\nThus minimal is turn 45.\n\nIn my sequence, I reach at turn 45.\n\nBut in the sequence, I used H turns from turn 35.\n\nStart turn 35, after H actions, at turn 35+H, y=9.\n\nIn my case, actions from t=35 to 44? Let's see.\n\nAt turn 35, I perform action a_{35}, which determines y_{36}.\n\nThen a_{36} determines y_{37}, and so on, up to a_{t} when I reach y=9.\n\nWhen I reach y=9, I stop, so the last action is when I go to y=9.\n\nFor example, if at turn T, I am at y=8, and I do U, then at turn T+1, I am at y=9.\n\nSo the sequence of actions until I reach y=9.\n\nIn minimal H, the number of actions.\n\nI start at turn 35, position y=0.\n\nAfter H actions, I am at (turn 35+H, y=9).\n\nThe actions are for turns 35 to 35+H-1, and y_{35+H} =9.\n\nIn my earlier sequence:\n\nTurn 35: S, so y_{36} = 0\n\nTurn 36: U, y_{37} = 1\n\nTurn 37: U, y_{38} = 2\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 44: at y=8, U, so y_{45} =9\n\nSo actions from turn 35 to 44, that's 10 actions: t=35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44.\n\nH=10, reaching at turn 45.\n\nTurn 35: first action, after that turn 36 y=0\n\nAfter H actions, turn 35+H.\n\ny_{35+H} =9.\n\nIn this case, H=10, turn 45.\n\nIf no cars, I could: turn 35 U, y36=1; 36 U, y37=2; ... 43 U, y44=9, so H=9 actions, reach at turn 44.\n\nBut here, I need to delay by one turn.\n\nIn my sequence, I have one S at the beginning.\n\nCould I delay later?\n\nFor example, go up to some point and wait.\n\nBut since y=1 to 5 are only unsafe at T=36, and I need to pass through them, I have to be on them at some turn not 36.\n\nIn the direct path, if I go up continuously, I would be on y=1 at T=36 if I start at 35 with U, but I avoided that by waiting.\n\nIf I go up later, I might be on y=1 after T=36, which is fine, but it might take more turns.\n\nFor example, if I stay at y=0 for multiple turns, I delay more.\n\nOr, since y=6 and y=7 are always safe, I could go directly to them, but I can only move one step per turn, so I have to go through y=1 to 5 eventually.\n\nNo way to skip.\n\nAnother idea: at turn 35, I do S, y=0.\n\nThen turn 36, instead of U, I could do S again, but then at turn 37, I do U to y=1 at 38, then U to y=2 at 39, ..., up to y=9 at turn 46, which is later than 45.\n\nWorse.\n\nOr, I could go down, but at y=0, cannot go down.\n\nSo minimal is to wait one turn at start, then go up.\n\nBut in my sequence, I waited at y=0.\n\nCould I wait at another y?\n\nFor example, suppose I go up to y=5 quickly, but y=5 is unsafe at T=36.\n\nAt turn 35, if I go U, to y=1 at 36, collision, not possible.\n\nSo I must not be on y=1 to 5 at turn 36.\n\nTherefore, at turn 36, I must be at y=0 or y=6 or above.\n\ny=0: possible, as I did.\n\ny=6: but to be at y=6 at turn 36, I need to be at y=5 at turn 35, but at turn 35 I start at y=0, so impossible to be at y=5 in one turn.\n\nSimilarly, y=7 or 8, impossible.\n\nSo only possibility is to be at y=0 at turn 36.\n\nThen from there, go up.\n\nThus, the sequence must have a stay at turn 35, then up from turn 36 onwards.\n\nNow, for the upper freeways, y=8 has issue only at T=35, but since I go to y=8 later, it's fine.\n\nIn my sequence, I go to y=8 at turn 44, which is safe.\n\nPerhaps I can go faster through y=6 and 7, but no need, since I go at speed one.\n\nAnother thing: on y=6 and y=7, no cars ever, so I can be there anytime.\n\nBut in the path, I go through them normally.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I have 10 actions.\n\nBut let's list the actions.\n\nStart: turn 35, position y=0.\n\nAction a_{35}: since if U, go to y=1 at 36, collision, so must S.\n\nThen at turn 36, y=0.\n\nAction a_{36}: I do U, to y=1 at 37.\n\nTurn 37, y=1, do U to y=2 at 38.\n\n...\n\nUp to turn 43: at y=7 (since from y=7 at turn 43, U to y=8 at 44)\n\nLet's list the y at each turn.\n\nTurn 35: y=0, action S, so y_{36}=0\n\nTurn 36: y=0, action U, y_{37}=1\n\nTurn 37: y=1, action U, y_{38}=2\n\nTurn 38: y=2, action U, y_{39}=3\n\nTurn 39: y=3, action U, y_{40}=4\n\nTurn 40: y=4, action U, y_{41}=5\n\nTurn 41: y=5, action U, y_{42}=6\n\nTurn 42: y=6, action U, y_{43}=7\n\nTurn 43: y=7, action U, y_{44}=8\n\nTurn 44: y=8, action U, y_{45}=9\n\nNow at turn 45, y=9, reached.\n\nSo actions from turn 35 to 44.\n\nH=10 actions.\n\nIn the answer, it should be the actions for turns starting from t1=35.\n\nThe sequence is a_{35}, a_{36}, ..., a_{44}\n\nWith a_{35}=S, a_{36}=U, a_{37}=U, ..., a_{44}=U\n\nFrom a_{36} to a_{44} all U, except a_{35}=S.\n\nIn the output, it should be for each turn.\n\nThe answer format: Turn t1: a_{t1}, Turn t1+1: a_{t1+1}, etc.\n\nt1=35.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 35: S\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: U\n\nAnd that's it, since after a_{44}, at turn 45, y=9.\n\nIn the sequence, the last action is at turn 44.\n\nH=10 turns of actions? From t=35 to 44, that's 10 actions.\n\nBut let's confirm if at any point collision.\n\nAt turn 37, y=1, T=37, which is after 36, so no car at x=0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, turn 38, y=2, T=38>36, safe.\n\n...\n\nTurn 44, y=8, T=44, as computed, no car at x=0.\n\ny=6 and y=7 always safe.\n\nSo all good.\n\nIs there a way with H=9?\n\nSuppose I do something else.\n\nFor example, at turn 35, S, y=0.\n\nThen turn 36, U to y=1 at 37.\n\nThen from turn 37 to 44, I need to go from y=1 to y=9, that's 8 steps, so at turn 45 y=9, same as before.\n\nIf I go faster, but I can only move one per turn.\n\nPerhaps skip some actions, but no.\n\nAnother idea: since y=6 and y=7 safe, but I have to go through lower rows.\n\nSuppose at turn 35, I do S.\n\nThen turn 36, I do S again, but then I need to start later.\n\nTurn 36 S, y=0.\n\nThen turn 37 U to y=1 at 38, then to y=2 at 39, ..., y=9 at 46, worse.\n\nOr, go down, but cannot at y=0.\n\nSo no, minimal is H=10.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions from turn 35 to 44, 10 actions.\n\nNow, in the car state, for freeway 3,4,5, there were multiple cars, but we saw only at T=36 unsafe.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nIn freeway 8, at T=35 unsafe, but we not there.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nNow, the answer should be the sequence.\n\nBut let's write it in the format.\n\nAlso, for freeway 3,4,5, at T=36, the third car has span exactly [ -11, 0 ] at ΔT=1, so includes 0, collision.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo yes.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 10, with the sequence above.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have one S and nine U's? a35=S, then a36 to a44: that's 9 U's? a36 to a44 is 9 actions? Turns: 36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44: that's 9 turns.\n\nList:\n\nActions:\n\n- a35: S (for turn 35)\n\n- a36: U\n\n- a37: U\n\n- a38: U\n\n- a39: U\n\n- a40: U\n\n- a41: U\n\n- a42: U\n\n- a43: U\n\n- a44: U\n\nThat's 10 actions: indices from 35 to 44 inclusive.\n\nAfter a44, at turn 45, y=9.\n\nIf I count the actions: t=35 to 44, 10 actions.\n\nNumber of turns from t=35 to t=44 is 10 turns.\n\nt=35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44: that's 10 turns.\n\nYes.\n\nH=10.\n\nNow, in the output, it should be:\n\nTurn 35: S\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: U\n\nTurn 39: U\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: U\n\nBut at turn 44, I am at y=8, and I go to y=9 at 45.\n\nYes.\n\nI could have a shorter sequence if I don't need to go through all, but I must go from 0 to 9, so min 9 moves, but with constraint, 10 actions including one stay.\n\nIn terms of the number of moves: I need at least 9 up moves, and possibly some stays or downs, but downs would require more moves, so minimal actions with one stay.\n\nIn this case, one stay and nine ups, total 10 actions.\n\nIf I do downs, it would be worse.\n\nSo this should be minimal.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is as above.\n\nNow, for the answer format.\n\nAlso, in the car state, for freeway 8, there is a car (6,-5,right,6), at T=35, span [-5,6], includes 0, so if on y=8 at T=35, collision, but we not there.\n\nSimilarly, all fine.\n\nSo I think that's the answer.\n</think>\nTo reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn 35 in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\), the player must avoid being on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(5\\) at turn 36 and freeway \\(y = 8\\) at turn 35, as these are the only turns where a collision occurs at \\(x = 0\\) for these freeways. Specifically:\n\n- Freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(5\\) have a collision at \\(x = 0\\) only at turn 36.\n- Freeway \\(y = 8\\) has a collision at \\(x = 0\\) only at turn 35.\n- Freeways \\(y = 6\\) and \\(y = 7\\) are always safe, as no car covers \\(x = 0\\) at any turn.\n\nStarting at turn 35 with \\(y = 0\\), the player cannot move up immediately because that would place them on \\(y = 1\\) at turn 36, resulting in a collision. Therefore, the player must stay (S) at turn 35 to remain at \\(y = 0\\). From turn 36 onwards, all freeways are safe, and the player can move up (U) consecutively to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 45.\n\nThe minimal sequence of actions is as follows:\n- At turn 35, stay (S) to avoid moving to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 36.\n- From turns 36 to 44, move up (U) each turn to increment \\(y\\) by 1 per turn, reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 45.\n\nThis sequence requires 10 actions (from turn 35 to turn 44) and reaches the goal at turn 45. Any attempt to reach \\(y = 9\\) earlier (e.g., by turn 44) would require being on \\(y = 1\\) at turn 36, which is unsafe. Delaying the ascent further would result in a longer sequence.\n\n**Action Sequence:**\n- Turn 35: S (stay at \\(y = 0\\))\n- Turn 36: U (move to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 37)\n- Turn 37: U (move to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 38)\n- Turn 38: U (move to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 39)\n- Turn 39: U (move to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 40)\n- Turn 40: U (move to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 41)\n- Turn 41: U (move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 42)\n- Turn 42: U (move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 43)\n- Turn 43: U (move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 44)\n- Turn 44: U (move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 45)\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 35: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 36: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 37: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 38: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 39: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 40: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 41: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 42: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 43: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 44: U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t1=36, and I start at y=0.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the car movements. Cars move left or right at their speeds, and I have to avoid being on a freeway when there's a car covering position x=0 at that turn.\n\nThe player position updates at each turn based on the action: U for up (y+1), D for down (y-1), S for stay (y same). y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nFor collision: at turn T, if I'm on freeway k (so y_T = k), and for that freeway, there is a car such that 0 is in its span at turn T, then I collide.\n\nImportant point: if I move to a different y at turn T, I'm not considered on the new y until the next turn. So at turn T, after moving, I'm on y_{T} for collision check at turn T. If I move at turn T, I change to y_{T+1} at the start of turn T+1? Let me read carefully.\n\n\"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\"\n\nAnd Δy_t depends on action a_t.\n\nSo, at turn t, I perform action a_t, which sets y_{t+1}.\n\nThen, for collision at turn T, it's based on y_T and the car spans at turn T.\n\nThe note says: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\"\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me parse it.\n\nAt turn T, when I perform action a_T, it determines y_{T+1}.\n\nBut for collision check at turn T, it's based on y_T, because y_T is my position during turn T.\n\nSimilarly, at turn T+1, collision check based on y_{T+1}.\n\nThe note is saying that if at turn T, I am moving to a different row, so y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, then at turn T, I am still on y_T, so I only care about cars on y_T at turn T. I don't care about cars on y_{T+1} at turn T, because I'm not there yet.\n\nAnd specifically, if on y_{T+1}, at turn T, 0 is covered but at turn T+1 it's not, but since I'm not on y_{T+1} at turn T, I don't collide.\n\nSimilarly, if I move to y_{T+1} at turn T, I will be on y_{T+1} at turn T+1, so at turn T+1, I check cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nI think I have it.\n\nNow, for the cars, their positions are given at turn t1=36, and I need to compute for future turns T > t1.\n\nThe car span at time T is given by:\n\nFor left-moving: span(T) = [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]? Let's see the notation.\n\n\"Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\" for left-moving.\n\nBut in the span, it's [head, tail], but for left-moving, head is on the left, I think? No.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nFor car k on freeway i, at turn t1, head at h, tail at τ, direction d, speed s.\n\nFor left-moving: d=left, I assume.\n\nThen at T, span becomes [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]? No.\n\n\"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\" for right-moving.\n\nIn the right-moving case, at t1, span is given as [τ, h], which might imply τ is left, h is right, so [left, right].\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, at t1, [h, τ], and since it's moving left, h might be the head on the left.\n\nBut in terms of the interval, it's the set of x covered.\n\nCollision if 0 is in the span at time T for the freeway I'm on.\n\n0 in [min, max] of the span.\n\nNow, for each freeway, there are multiple cars listed.\n\nI need to consider all cars on a freeway.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=0 at turn 36.\n\ny=0 is not a freeway, I think. Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars. The goal is (0,9), so y=9 is safe.\n\nAt turn T, if y_T =0 or y_T=9, no collision possible, since no freeway there.\n\nOnly when on y=1 to 8, I need to avoid cars at x=0.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 to y=9, so I have to pass through y=1 to 8, but I can stay or move up and down.\n\nSince I want minimal turns, probably I should go up as fast as possible, but I have to avoid the cars.\n\nFirst, let's list the car states at t1=36 for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-24, 11, left, 36)\n\nDirection left, speed 36.\n\nAt t1=36, span [h, τ] = [-24, 11] for left-moving.\n\nSince moving left, at time T, span [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] = [-24 - 36ΔT, 11 - 36ΔT] where ΔT = T - t1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? (-24, 11, left, 36)\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: (-48, -59, right, 12), (36, 25, right, 12), (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nFor right-moving, at t1, span given as [τ, h], I think.\n\nLet's see: for right-moving, \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\"\n\nIn the table, it's written as (head, tail, direction, speed), but for direction, it might be inconsistent.\n\nLook at freeway 3: cars listed as (-48, -59, right, 12), etc.\n\nIn the car state, it says \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nBut for the span definition, it depends on direction.\n\nFor left-moving, span at t1 is [h, τ]\n\nFor right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h]\n\nIn the freeway 3, first car: (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nSince direction is right, span at t1 should be [τ, h] = [-59, -48]? But it's given as (head, tail) = (-48, -59), which might be confusing.\n\nI think \"head\" and \"tail\" are relative to direction.\n\nIn the problem, it says: for left-moving, span(t1) = [h, τ], and for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h].\n\nBut in the car state, it's listed as (h, τ, d, s), so for interpretation:\n\nFor a car, (h, τ, d, s):\n\nIf d=left, then at t1, span is [h, τ] meaning from h to τ, with h and τ as given.\n\nSimilarly, if d=right, at t1, span is [τ, h] meaning from τ to h.\n\nIn freeway 3, first car: (h, τ, d, s) = (-48, -59, right, 12)\n\nSince d=right, span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (36, 25, right, 12) — (h, τ) = (36, 25), d=right, so span [τ, h] = [25, 36]\n\nBut τ=25, h=36, so [25,36]\n\nThird car: (0, -11, right, 12) — h=0, τ=-11, d=right, span [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nLet's list for each freeway the span at t1 and how it moves.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: d=left, s=36, span at t1: [h, τ] = [-24, 11]\n\nSince moving left, at time T, span [ -24 - 36ΔT, 11 - 36ΔT ] where ΔT = T - 36\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: [-24, 11] at t1, moving left at speed 36.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars:\n\nCar1: d=right, s=12, span at t1 [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nMoving right, so at T, span [ -59 + 12ΔT, -48 + 12ΔT ]\n\nCar2: d=right, s=12, (h,τ)=(36,25), span at t1 [τ,h] = [25,36]\n\nAt T, [25 + 12ΔT, 36 + 12ΔT]\n\nCar3: d=right, s=12, (h,τ)=(0,-11), span at t1 [τ,h] = [-11,0]\n\nAt T, [-11 + 12ΔT, 0 + 12ΔT] = [-11 + 12ΔT, 12ΔT]\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3? Cars: (-48,-59,right,12), (36,25,right,12), (0,-11,right,12) — identical to freeway 3.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5: same.\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (60,49,right,6)\n\n(h,τ)=(60,49), d=right, so span at t1 [τ,h] = [49,60]\n\nMoving right, s=6, at T, [49 + 6ΔT, 60 + 6ΔT]\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway 6: (60,49,right,6) → [49,60] at t1, at T [49+6ΔT, 60+6ΔT]\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: (60,49,right,6) and (12,1,right,6)\n\nFirst car: same as above, [49,60] at t1, at T [49+6ΔT, 60+6ΔT]\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,6), so (h,τ)=(12,1), d=right, span at t1 [τ,h] = [1,12]\n\nAt T, [1 + 6ΔT, 12 + 6ΔT]\n\nNow, I need to find when position x=0 is covered on each freeway for various times.\n\nThat is, for each freeway k, and for time T, if there is a car on k such that 0 in its span at T.\n\nThen, when I am on that row at that time, I must avoid it.\n\nSince I start at turn 36, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 as soon as possible.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0, or +1, so to go from 0 to 9, minimum 9 steps if I go up every time, but I might need to wait or go down to avoid collisions.\n\nH is the number of turns from t1, so at turn t1 + H - 1, y =9.\n\nAfter H actions, I am at turn t1 + H, position y_{t1+H}.\n\nLet's clarify the indexing.\n\nAt turn t1, I am at position (0, y_{t1}) = (0,0)\n\nI perform action a_{t1}, which sets y_{t1+1}\n\nThen at turn t1+1, I am at y_{t1+1}, and so on.\n\nAfter performing action at turn t, I am at y_{t+1} for the next state.\n\nBut for collision at turn t, it is based on y_t and the cars at turn t.\n\nAt turn t, before action, I am at y_t.\n\nI perform a_t, which sets y_{t+1}.\n\nThen collision check at turn t: if y_t between 1 and 8, and for that freeway, there is a car with 0 in span at turn t.\n\nSimilarly at turn t+1, based on y_{t+1}, etc.\n\nIn this case, at turn t1=36, I am at y=0, which is safe, no collision.\n\nI perform a_{36}, which sets y_{37}, and so on.\n\nI need y_{t1 + H} = 9 at some H.\n\nAfter H actions, I am at turn t1 + H, and y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t= t1 to t1 + H -1, so H actions.\n\nStart: turn t1, position y_{t1} =0\n\nAfter a_{t1}, y_{t1+1} = y_{t1} + Δy_{t1}\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{t1 + k}, y_{t1 + k +1}\n\nSet y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nThe turn when I reach y=9 is turn t1 + H.\n\nAt that turn, if y=9, no collision.\n\nNow, I need to find minimal H and actions.\n\nSince I start at y=0, and end at y=9, and must go through 1-8, the minimal H is at least 9, if I go up every time.\n\nBut I might need more if I have to wait.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, the times when x=0 is covered, i.e., unsafe times.\n\nThen for each row, I can find safe times to be there.\n\nSince I move one row at a time, I need to plan a path.\n\nLet ΔT = T - 36, so T = 36 + ΔT.\n\nFor freeway 1: car span at T: [ -24 -36ΔT, 11 -36ΔT ]\n\n0 in this span if -24 -36ΔT <= 0 <= 11 -36ΔT\n\nWhich is:\n\n-24 -36ΔT <= 0 and 0 <= 11 -36ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: -24 -36ΔT <= 0 => -36ΔT <= 24 => multiply by -1, reverse inequality: 36ΔT >= -24 => ΔT >= -24/36 = -2/3\n\nSince ΔT >=0, this is always true for ΔT >=0.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 11 -36ΔT => 36ΔT <= 11 => ΔT <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305\n\nSo for ΔT <= 11/36, 0 is in span.\n\nSince ΔT integer, ΔT =0: T=36\n\nAt T=36, 0 in [ -24, 11]? At T=36, ΔT=0, span [-24,11], 0 is between -24 and 11, yes.\n\nΔT=0: T=36, 0 <=11, true.\n\nΔT=1: T=37, span [-24-36, 11-36] = [-60, -25], 0 not in [-60,-25], since -25<0.\n\nSimilarly for ΔT>0, span more negative.\n\nSo for freeway 1, unsafe only at T=36.\n\nΔT=0 only.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, unsafe only at T=36.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars.\n\nCar1: span at T: [-59 +12ΔT, -48 +12ΔT]\n\n0 in this if -59+12ΔT <= 0 <= -48+12ΔT\n\nFirst: -59+12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <=59 => ΔT <=59/12=4.916, so ΔT <=4\n\nSecond: 0 <= -48+12ΔT => 48 <=12ΔT => ΔT >=4\n\nSo ΔT >=4 and ΔT <=4.916, so ΔT=4? Integer.\n\nΔT=4: T=40\n\nCheck: at ΔT=4, car1 span: -59+48, -48+48 = [-11,0]\n\n0 in [-11,0]? -11 <=0 <=0, yes, 0 is included.\n\nAt ΔT=5: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nΔT=3: -59+36= -23, -48+36= -12, [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSo car1 unsafe only at ΔT=4, T=40.\n\nCar2: span [25 +12ΔT, 36 +12ΔT]\n\n0 in this if 25+12ΔT <=0 <=36+12ΔT\n\nFirst: 25+12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <= -25, impossible since ΔT>=0, left side positive.\n\nSo never, 0 not in [25+12ΔT, 36+12ΔT] for ΔT>=0.\n\nCar3: span [-11 +12ΔT, 0 +12ΔT] = [-11+12ΔT, 12ΔT]\n\n0 in this if -11+12ΔT <=0 <=12ΔT\n\nFirst: -11+12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <=11 => ΔT <=11/12≈0.916, so ΔT=0\n\nSecond: 0 <=12ΔT, always true for ΔT>=0.\n\nAt ΔT=0: 0 <=12*0=0, yes.\n\nSo for car3, unsafe at ΔT=0, T=36.\n\nThus for freeway 3, unsafe when either car covers 0.\n\nAt T=36, car3 covers 0: span [-11,0], 0 in it.\n\nAt T=40, car1 covers 0: span [-11,0] at T=40? Earlier car1 at T=40: [-11,0], yes.\n\nAnd car2 never.\n\nSo unsafe at T=36 and T=40.\n\nΔT=0 and ΔT=4.\n\nT=36 and T=40.\n\nNow freeway 4: same as freeway 3, since cars identical, so unsafe at T=36 and T=40.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5: same, unsafe at T=36 and T=40.\n\nNow freeway 6: one car, span at T: [49 +6ΔT, 60 +6ΔT]\n\n0 in this? 49+6ΔT <=0 <=60+6ΔT\n\nFirst: 49+6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <= -49, impossible.\n\nSo never unsafe, always safe for freeway 6.\n\nSimilarly freeway 7: same, always safe.\n\nNow freeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: same as freeway 6, [49+6ΔT,60+6ΔT], never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: (12,1,right,6), span at t1 [1,12], at T [1+6ΔT, 12+6ΔT]\n\n0 in this if 1+6ΔT <=0 <=12+6ΔT\n\nFirst: 1+6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <= -1, impossible.\n\nSo never covers 0.\n\nThus freeway 8 always safe.\n\nSummary:\n\n- Freeway 1: unsafe only at T=36\n\n- Freeway 2: unsafe only at T=36\n\n- Freeway 3: unsafe at T=36 and T=40\n\n- Freeway 4: unsafe at T=36 and T=40\n\n- Freeway 5: unsafe at T=36 and T=40\n\n- Freeway 6: always safe\n\n- Freeway 7: always safe\n\n- Freeway 8: always safe\n\nNow, I start at turn 36, y=0, which is safe.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nAt each turn, when I am on a freeway row, it must be safe at that turn.\n\nNow, since I start at T=36, and for rows 1,2,3,4,5, T=36 is unsafe, so I cannot be on those rows at T=36.\n\nBut at T=36, I am at y=0, not on freeway, so ok.\n\nNow, I need to move to y=1,2,... up to 9.\n\nThe earliest I can be on row 1 is at some turn after 36, since at 36 it is unsafe for row 1.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nLet me denote the time when I arrive at each row.\n\nI need to find a sequence of y positions over time.\n\nSet t = turn number.\n\nStart at t=36, y=0.\n\nAfter action a_{36}, y_{37} = 0,1, or -1? But y must be >=0, so if y=0, D would go to -1, not allowed, so from y=0, I can only do U or S, to y=1 or y=0.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, I can only do D or S, but since I want to reach y=9, once there I can stay.\n\nBut minimal turns, so I go up.\n\nNow, let's find for each row, the safe times.\n\nRow 1: unsafe at t=36, safe for t>36, since only unsafe at 36.\n\nSimilarly row 2: unsafe only at 36, safe for t>36.\n\nRow 3: unsafe at t=36 and t=40.\n\nSo unsafe at 36 and 40, safe for other t.\n\nSimilarly row 4: same, unsafe at 36 and 40.\n\nRow 5: same.\n\nRow 6,7,8: always safe.\n\nRow 9: safe, no cars.\n\nI need to go from y=0 to y=9 with minimal steps.\n\nEach step I can change y by -1,0,+1.\n\nTo minimize time, I should go up as much as possible, but may need to wait to avoid unsafe times.\n\nStart at t=36, y=0.\n\nI can take action U to go to y=1 at t=37? After a_{36}, y_{37} = y_{36} + Δy, with a_{36}.\n\nIf I do U at t=36, y_{37} = 0 + 1 =1.\n\nThen at turn t=37, I am at y=1.\n\nNow, row 1 is safe at t=37, since unsafe only at 36.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to y=1 at t=37, it is safe.\n\nThen from there, I can go to y=2 at t=38, and so on.\n\nBut I need to check row 3 at t=40, which is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly for row 4 and 5.\n\nSince rows 6-8 are always safe, I need to get past row 5 before t=40 or after, but since t=40 is unsafe for 3,4,5, I should not be on them at t=40.\n\nt=40 is unsafe for row 3,4,5.\n\nNow, let me plan the path.\n\nStart: t=36, y=0.\n\nI want to go up.\n\nOption: at t=36, action U: then y_{37} =1\n\nAt t=37, I am at y=1, which is safe (since t=37>36)\n\nThen I can do U again: a_{37}=U, y_{38}=2\n\nAt t=38, y=2, row 2 safe (only unsafe at 36)\n\nThen U: a_{38}=U, y_{39}=3\n\nNow at t=39, y=3.\n\nRow 3 is unsafe at t=36 and t=40, but t=39 is not 36 or 40, so should be safe.\n\nt=39, ΔT=39-36=3, for row 3, unsafe at ΔT=0 and 4, t=36 and 40.\n\nt=39 is ΔT=3, safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=39, y=3, I can do U: a_{39}=U, y_{40}=4\n\nNow at t=40, y=4.\n\nBut row 4 is unsafe at t=40! Oh, problem.\n\ny_{40}=4, so at turn t=40, I am on row 4, which is unsafe at t=40.\n\nCollision.\n\nNot good.\n\nI could stay or go down at t=39.\n\nAt t=39, y=3, instead of U, I could do S or D.\n\nIf S, y_{40}=3, then at t=40, y=3, which is unsafe, row 3 unsafe at t=40.\n\nIf D, y_{40}=2, at t=40, y=2, row 2 is safe for t>36, so t=40>36, safe.\n\nBut then I go down to y=2.\n\nNot progress.\n\nI need to avoid being on row 3,4,5 at t=40.\n\nt=40 is unsafe for 3,4,5.\n\nSo I should be not on rows 3,4,5 at turn t=40.\n\nEither before or after.\n\nSince I start from below, I might reach row 3 before t=40 or after.\n\nt=40 is the unsafe turn.\n\nNow, at t=36, I am at y=0.\n\nIf I go up directly:\n\nt=36: y=0, action U, y_{37}=1\n\nt=37: y=1, action U, y_{38}=2\n\nt=38: y=2, action U, y_{39}=3\n\nt=39: y=3, now if I go U, y_{40}=4, unsafe at t=40.\n\nIf I stay, y_{40}=3, unsafe at t=40.\n\nIf I go down, y_{40}=2, safe but down.\n\nAt t=39, y=3, I could do nothing to avoid t=40 on row 3,4,5.\n\nBut I have to be somewhere.\n\nAnother idea: delay the ascent so that I reach row 3 after t=40.\n\nFor example, start by staying at y=0 for some turns.\n\nBut staying might waste time.\n\nMinimal H, so I should not stay if possible.\n\nI could go up to row 2 and stay there until after t=40, but row 2 is safe except t=36, so at t=40, I can be on row 2.\n\nThen after t=40, go up.\n\nBut row 2 at t=40 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, rows 6-8 always safe.\n\nSo let's plan.\n\nOption 1: go up to row 2 by t=38, then stay or go up, but row 3 is unsafe at t=40.\n\nAt t=38: y=2, which is safe.\n\nThen at t=38, action: I can do U to go to y=3 at t=39.\n\nThen at t=39, y=3, safe.\n\nThen at t=39, if I go U, to y=4 at t=40, unsafe.\n\nIf I stay, y=3 at t=40, unsafe.\n\nIf I go D, to y=2 at t=40, safe.\n\nBut then I am at y=2 at t=40.\n\nThen after that, I can go up.\n\nBut I lost progress.\n\nAt t=38, instead of going to y=3, I could stay at y=2.\n\nAt t=38: y=2, action S, then y_{39}=2\n\nAt t=39: y=2, action S, y_{40}=2\n\nAt t=40: y=2, safe, since row 2 safe.\n\nThen at t=40, I can go U to y=3 at t=41.\n\nBut t=41, row 3: is it safe? Row 3 unsafe only at t=36 and t=40, so t=41 safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut I stayed at y=2 for two turns, which takes extra time.\n\nFrom start:\n\nt=36: y=0, action U, to y=1 at t=37 (1 step)\n\nt=37: y=1, action U, to y=2 at t=38 (2 steps)\n\nt=38: y=2, action S, to y=2 at t=39 (3 steps, but y same)\n\nt=39: y=2, action S, to y=2 at t=40 (4 steps)\n\nt=40: y=2, action U, to y=3 at t=41 (5 steps, y=3)\n\nt=41: y=3, action U, to y=4 at t=42 (6 steps)\n\nNow at t=42, y=4, row 4 unsafe only at t=36 and t=40, t=42>40, safe.\n\nSimilarly, continue up.\n\nt=42: y=4, action U, to y=5 at t=43 (7 steps)\n\nt=43: y=5, action U, to y=6 at t=44 (8 steps)\n\nt=44: y=6, action U, to y=7 at t=45 (9 steps)\n\nt=45: y=7, action U, to y=8 at t=46 (10 steps)\n\nt=46: y=8, action U, to y=9 at t=47 (11 steps)\n\ny=9 at t=47.\n\nH=11 actions? From t=36 to t=46, actions a_{36} to a_{46}, that's 11 actions, reach y=9 at t=47.\n\nBut minimal should be 9 if no obstacles.\n\nBut I had to wait at y=2 for two turns to avoid t=40 on row 3-5.\n\nt=40 is unsafe for row 3,4,5, so I need to be not on them at t=40.\n\nIn the above, I was at y=2 at t=40, safe.\n\nThen went up.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nPerhaps I can go to row 6-8 earlier, but I have to go through 1-5 first.\n\nAnother idea: since rows 1 and 2 are safe after t=36, I could go up to row 2 quickly, then wait, but I did that.\n\nAt t=39, instead of staying at y=2, I could go down, but that would be worse.\n\nPerhaps I can be on row 5 or above before t=40.\n\nt=40 is unsafe, so if I can be on row 5 before t=40, but row 5 unsafe at t=40, but if I am on row 5 at t=39, for example.\n\nLet's see the timing.\n\nStart t=36, y=0.\n\nIf I go up every time:\n\nt=36: U, y_{37}=1\n\nt=37: U, y_{38}=2\n\nt=38: U, y_{39}=3\n\nt=39: U, y_{40}=4\n\nBut at t=40, y=4, unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nt=36: U, y_{37}=1\n\nt=37: U, y_{38}=2\n\nt=38: U, y_{39}=3\n\nNow at t=39, y=3, I do D, y_{40}=2, then at t=40, y=2, safe.\n\nThen at t=40, U, y_{41}=3\n\nt=41: U, y_{42}=4\n\netc.\n\nBut from y=2 at t=40, go to y=3 at t=41, then to y=4 at t=42, etc., same as before but I didn't stay, I went down and up.\n\nIn terms of time, at t=39 I was at y=3, then down to y=2 at t=40, then up to y=3 at t=41, so I wasted two actions to go down and up, same as staying at y=2 for two turns in terms of time, but I moved.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nt=36: U, to y=1 at t=37\n\nt=37: U, to y=2 at t=38\n\nt=38: U, to y=3 at t=39\n\nt=39: D, to y=2 at t=40  // down\n\nt=40: U, to y=3 at t=41  // up\n\nt=41: U, to y=4 at t=42\n\n...\n\nThen to y=9 at t=47 same as before.\n\nBut at t=40, I am at y=2, safe.\n\nThen to y=3 at t=41, safe since row 3 unsafe only at 36 and 40.\n\nt=41 safe.\n\nBut I used an extra action: from t=38 to t=39 I went to y=3, then down to y=2 at t=40, so I spent an action to go to y=3 and back, whereas if I stayed at y=2, I save that.\n\nIn the first plan, I stayed at y=2 from t=38 to t=39 and t=39 to t=40, so at t=39 I am at y=2, t=40 at y=2.\n\nIn this, at t=39 I am at y=3, t=40 at y=2.\n\nThen to y=3 at t=41.\n\nSo to reach y=3 at t=41, in both cases, but in the stay case, I didn't go to y=3 at t=39.\n\nIn stay case: at t=39, y=2, t=40 y=2, then t=41 y=3.\n\nIn the down-up case: at t=39 y=3, t=40 y=2, t=41 y=3.\n\nSo at t=39, in down-up, I was at y=3, which is safe, but then I went down.\n\nBut for reaching higher, same time.\n\nBut in down-up, I used actions to go up and down, whereas in stay, I used S actions.\n\nBut both take two turns to go from y=2 at t=38 to y=3 at t=41.\n\nNow, after that, same.\n\nBut in the stay case, I have to use S actions, which might be fine.\n\nBut for minimal time, both take the same number of turns to reach y=9.\n\nIn both sequences, I reach y=9 at t=47.\n\nBut can I do better?\n\nPerhaps I can go faster to higher rows where it is safe.\n\nFor example, rows 6,7,8 are always safe, so if I can get to row 6 quickly, but I have to go through 1-5.\n\nThe bottleneck is rows 3,4,5 at t=40.\n\nt=40 is the only unsafe time besides t=36, which is past.\n\nSo I need to avoid being on row 3,4,5 at t=40.\n\nTherefore, at t=40, I must be on row <=2 or row >=6.\n\nSince row 2 is safe at t=40, and row 6 is safe.\n\nNow, from start, I can be at row 2 by t=38.\n\nAt t=38, y=2.\n\nThen from t=38 to t=40, I can stay at y=2, safe.\n\nThen at t=40, I can go up to y=3 at t=41, but t=41, row 3 safe.\n\nBut to go to row 6, I need to go up from row 2.\n\nAt t=40, y=2, I can go U to y=3 at t=41.\n\nBut if I could be at row 6 by t=40, but from start, to reach row 6, I need at least 6 steps: from y=0 to y=6, 6 actions.\n\nStart t=36, after k actions, at turn t=36+k, y= something.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t=36+H, y=9.\n\nBut let's think in terms of turn.\n\nAt turn t, y_t.\n\nStart t=36, y=0.\n\nAfter a_t, y_{t+1}.\n\nTo be at row 6 at turn t, for example.\n\nMinimal turn to be at row 2: at t=38, y=2 possible, as above.\n\nTo be at row 6: if I go up continuously, y=6 at t=36 + 6 = t=42? Let's see:\n\nt=36: y=0, after U, y_{37}=1\n\nt=37: y=1, after U, y_{38}=2\n\nt=38: y=2, after U, y_{39}=3\n\nt=39: y=3, after U, y_{40}=4\n\nBut at t=40, y=4, unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nTo reach y=6 earlier? Earliest: from y=0 to y=6 in 6 actions, but with the unsafe, I need to avoid t=40 on 3,4,5.\n\nSo the fastest to reach y=6 is at t=42, as in the first sequence.\n\nt=42: y=4 in my first sequence, but I can go faster to y=6.\n\nIn the sequence where I wait at y=2:\n\nAt t=40: y=2\n\nThen t=40: U, y_{41}=3\n\nt=41: U, y_{42}=4\n\nt=42: U, y_{43}=5\n\nt=43: U, y_{44}=6\n\nSo y=6 at t=44.\n\nIf I don't wait, but go down, same.\n\nBut at t=39, if I am at y=3, and I go up, y_{40}=4, unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nPerhaps I can be on row 5 before t=40.\n\nFor example, at t=39, y=5.\n\nCan I reach y=5 by t=39?\n\nStart t=36, y=0\n\nt=36: U, y_{37}=1\n\nt=37: U, y_{38}=2\n\nt=38: U, y_{39}=3\n\nBut y=3 at t=39, not 5.\n\nTo reach y=5 at t=39, I need to go up faster, but I can only change by 1 per turn, so impossible to be at y=5 before t=41? t=36 to t=37: y=1, t=38: y=2, t=39: y=3, t=40: y=4, t=41: y=5.\n\nEarliest y=5 at t=41.\n\nAt t=41, y=5, row 5 unsafe at t=36 and t=40, t=41>40, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 at t=40 is unsafe, but at t=41 y=5 safe.\n\nIn the sequence, I can be at y=5 at t=41.\n\nBut at t=40, where am I?\n\nIf I go directly, at t=40, y=4, unsafe.\n\nSo I need to be not on 4 at t=40.\n\nSo I must be at y<=2 or y>=6 at t=40.\n\ny>=6 at t=40: is it possible?\n\nTo be at y=6 at t=40.\n\ny=6 at turn t=40.\n\nStart from y=0 at t=36.\n\nAfter 4 actions, at t=40, y could be from 0 to 4, since each action increases y by at most 1, so y_{40} <= y_{36} + 4 = 4.\n\nSo at t=40, maximum y=4, cannot be y=5 or 6.\n\nSimilarly, minimum y=0, if I do S or D, but D not possible from 0.\n\nSo at t=40, possible y from 0 to 4.\n\nBut rows 3 and 4 are unsafe at t=40, so I must be at y=0,1,2 at t=40 to be safe.\n\ny=0: safe, no freeway.\n\ny=1: row 1, unsafe only at t=36, so at t=40 safe.\n\ny=2: row 2, safe.\n\ny=3: unsafe at t=40.\n\ny=4: unsafe.\n\nSo at t=40, I must be at y=0,1, or 2.\n\nIn particular, y=2 is safe and high, so best to be at y=2 at t=40.\n\nThen from there, go up.\n\nNow, to reach y=2 at t=40.\n\nFrom start, I can reach y=2 earlier, but I need to be at y=2 at t=40.\n\nI can arrive earlier and stay, or arrive later.\n\nBut since I want to go up, better to arrive earlier and stay.\n\nStart:\n\nt=36: y=0, action U, to y=1 at t=37\n\nt=37: y=1, action U, to y=2 at t=38\n\nNow at t=38, y=2.\n\nI need to be at y=2 at t=40, so I can stay for two turns.\n\nt=38: action S, to y=2 at t=39\n\nt=39: action S, to y=2 at t=40\n\nt=40: action U, to y=3 at t=41\n\nt=41: y=3, action U, to y=4 at t=42\n\nt=42: y=4, action U, to y=5 at t=43\n\nt=43: y=5, action U, to y=6 at t=44\n\nt=44: y=6, action U, to y=7 at t=45\n\nt=45: y=7, action U, to y=8 at t=46\n\nt=46: y=8, action U, to y=9 at t=47\n\nAs before.\n\nAfter reaching y=2 at t=38, I could go up to y=3 at t=39, but then at t=39, y=3, which is safe, but then at t=40, I need to not be on 3,4,5, so I must go down or something, but as before, it delays.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=38: U, to y=3 at t=39\n\nt=39: D, to y=2 at t=40  // down to avoid\n\nt=40: U, to y=3 at t=41\n\nThen same as above, but I reached y=3 at t=39 and back, whereas in stay, I stayed at y=2.\n\nIn terms of progress, at t=39, in this case y=3, in stay case y=2, but after that, both at y=3 at t=41? No.\n\nIn down-up: at t=41, y=3\n\nIn stay: at t=41, y=3 as well.\n\nIn stay: t=40: y=2, U to y=3 at t=41\n\nIn down-up: t=40: y=2, U to y=3 at t=41 same.\n\nBut in down-up, at t=39 I was at y=3, but I didn't stay, I went down.\n\nBut for the path to y=9, it doesn't help, and I used an extra U and D compared to S S.\n\nBut in action count, same.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 faster, I need to not waste time.\n\nBut rows 6-8 are always safe, so once I pass row 5, I can go up fast.\n\nBut I have to get to row 5 first.\n\nIn the sequence, I reach y=5 at t=43, then to y=6 at t=44, etc.\n\nCan I reach row 5 earlier?\n\nEarliest possible: to be at y=5 at t=41.\n\nHow?\n\nFrom start, t=36: U, y_{37}=1\n\nt=37: U, y_{38}=2\n\nt=38: U, y_{39}=3\n\nt=39: U, y_{40}=4  // but unsafe at t=40\n\nCannot.\n\nt=36: S, y_{37}=0\n\nThen t=37: U, y_{38}=1\n\nt=38: U, y_{39}=2\n\nt=39: U, y_{40}=3  // but row 3 unsafe at t=40\n\nNot good.\n\nt=36: U, y_{37}=1\n\nt=37: S, y_{38}=1\n\nThen t=38: U, y_{39}=2\n\nt=39: U, y_{40}=3 unsafe.\n\nNo way to be at y=5 at t=41 or earlier without being on unsafe row at t=40.\n\nSince at t=40, y<=4, and y=3 or 4 unsafe, so I must be at y<=2 at t=40.\n\nThus, the earliest to be at y=5 is t=41: from y=2 at t=40, U to y=3 at t=41, then U to y=4 at t=42, U to y=5 at t=43? Not.\n\nAt t=40: y=2, U to y=3 at t=41\n\nt=41: U to y=4 at t=42\n\nt=42: U to y=5 at t=43\n\nSo y=5 at t=43.\n\nThen y=6 at t=44, y=7 at t=45, y=8 at t=46, y=9 at t=47.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf from t=40 y=2, I go U to y=3 at t=41, but row 3 to 5 I can go faster, but no, one step per row.\n\nUnless I can skip, but I can't, only change by 1.\n\nSo minimal time to y=9 is at t=47, with 11 actions.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is a shorter path.\n\nPerhaps I can go down to y=0 and stay, but that would be slower.\n\nOr, another idea: since row 1 is safe after t=36, I could go to y=1 and stay until after t=40, but y=1 is lower than y=2.\n\nFor example, start t=36: U to y=1 at t=37\n\nThen stay at y=1: t=37: S, y_{38}=1\n\nt=38: S, y_{39}=1\n\nt=39: S, y_{40}=1  // at t=40, y=1, safe\n\nThen t=40: U to y=2 at t=41\n\nt=41: U to y=3 at t=42\n\nt=42: U to y=4 at t=43\n\n...\n\nThen y=9 later, at t=48 or something, worse.\n\ny=1 at t=41? t=40: y=1, U to y=2 at t=41\n\nThen t=41: U to y=3 at t=42\n\nt=42: U to y=4 at t=43\n\nt=43: U to y=5 at t=44\n\nt=44: U to y=6 at t=45\n\nt=45: U to y=7 at t=46\n\nt=46: U to y=8 at t=47\n\nt=47: U to y=9 at t=48\n\nSo y=9 at t=48, worse than before.\n\nSo best to be at higher safe row at t=40, which is y=2.\n\nThus, the sequence I have is optimal: reach y=2 early and wait.\n\nNow, in the sequence, I have actions from t=36 to t=46.\n\nt=36: action a_{36} = U, to y=1 at t=37\n\nt=37: a_{37} = U, to y=2 at t=38\n\nt=38: a_{38} = S, to y=2 at t=39\n\nt=39: a_{39} = S, to y=2 at t=40\n\nt=40: a_{40} = U, to y=3 at t=41\n\nt=41: a_{41} = U, to y=4 at t=42\n\nt=42: a_{42} = U, to y=5 at t=43\n\nt=43: a_{43} = U, to y=6 at t=44\n\nt=44: a_{44} = U, to y=7 at t=45\n\nt=45: a_{45} = U, to y=8 at t=46\n\nt=46: a_{46} = U, to y=9 at t=47\n\nNow, at t=47, y=9, reached.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=36 to t=46, that's 11 actions: a_{36} to a_{46}.\n\nH=11.\n\nBut let's list the actions:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{36}\n\nTurn t_1+1: a_{37}\n\n...\n\nUp to turn t_1 + H-1: a_{t1 + H-1}\n\nIn this case, t1=36, actions from a_{36} to a_{46}, so t from 36 to 46, that's 11 turns.\n\nt1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSet t=0: a_{t1}, t=1: a_{t1+1}, ..., t=H-1: a_{t1 + H-1}\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, position y_{t1 + H}.\n\nWe want y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 47, y=9, so t1 + H =47, t1=36, so H=11.\n\nActions: a_{36} to a_{46}.\n\nIn the sequence above, all actions are specified except I need to confirm safety.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAt turn t=36: y=0, safe\n\nAction a_{36}=U, sets y_{37}=1\n\nTurn t=37: y=1, row 1, at t=37, safe?

Let's see:\n\nt=36: after U, y_{37}=1\n\nt=37: after U, y_{38}=2\n\n...\n\nt=44: after U, y_{45}=9\n\nSo at turn t=45, y=9, with actions from a_{36} to a_{44}, that's 9 actions? t from 36 to 44 inclusive: 44-36+1=9 actions, reach y=9 at t=45.\n\nBut here with obstacles, I need to avoid.\n\nBut in this case, at t=40, if I were at y=4, unsafe.\n\nBut with 9 actions: a_{36} to a_{44}, y_{45}=9.\n\nBut to have y_{45}=9, I need 9 up actions, but at t=40, y would be y_{40}, which after 4 actions from t=36: actions a_{36},a_{37},a_{38},a_{39} determine y_{40}.\n\ny_{40} = y_{36} + sum_{k=36}^{39} Δy_k\n\ny_{36}=0, each Δy <=1, so y_{40} <=4.\n\nSimilarly, to be at y=9 at t=45, with actions a_{36} to a_{44}, y_{45} = y_{36} + sum_{k=36}^{44} Δy_k = 0 + sum of 9 Δy.\n\nIf all U, y_{45}=9.\n\nBut during the path, at t=40, y_{40} <=4, and if y_{40} in {3,4}, unsafe.\n\nNow, to avoid, I must have y_{40} <=2.\n\nBut y_{40} <=2, and I need y_{45}=9.\n\nThe increase from y_{40} to y_{45} is over 5 turns: actions a_{40} to a_{44} affect y_{41} to y_{45}.\n\ny_{45} = y_{40} + sum_{k=40}^{44} Δy_k\n\nSince y_{40} <=2, and each Δy <=1, y_{45} <= 2 + 5 =7 <9, cannot reach y=9 at t=45 if y_{40} <=2.\n\ny_{45} <= 2 + 5*1 =7 <9.\n\nIf y_{40} =0, y_{45} <=5, worse.\n\nSo impossible to reach y=9 at t=45 with y_{40} <=2.\n\nBut if I could have y_{40} >=6, but impossible, max y_{40}=4.\n\nSo indeed, cannot reach y=9 before t=47.\n\nt=46: y_{46}=9 possible? With actions a_{36} to a_{45}, 10 actions.\n\ny_{46} = y_{36} + sum_{k=36}^{45} Δy_k = 0 + sum of 10 Δy.\n\nIf all U, y_{46}=10>9, but I can reach y=9 with some S or D, but minimal time, I want to reach as soon as possible.\n\ny_{46}=9 possible with one S or something.\n\nBut y_{40} <=4.\n\ny_{46} = y_{40} + sum_{k=40}^{45} Δy_k\n\ny_{40} <=4, and sum_{k=40}^{45} Δy_k <=6, so y_{46} <=4+6=10.\n\nBut I need y_{46}=9.\n\nBut y_{40} <=2 to be safe at t=40.\n\nSo y_{40} <=2, then y_{46} <=2 + 6 =8 <9, cannot reach y=9 at t=46.\n\ny_{46} <=8 if y_{40} <=2.\n\nThus impossible to reach y=9 at t=46 or earlier.\n\nt=47 is earliest possible.\n\nWith H=11 actions, as above.\n\nIn the sequence, I have 11 actions to reach at t=47.\n\nBut in the sequence, actions a_{36} to a_{46}, that's 11 actions, y_{47}=9.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps with different path, but I think not.\n\nSo minimal H=11.\n\nNow, the actions: as above.\n\nIn the answer, I need to list the actions.\n\nCurrent turn t1=36.\n\nSequence: a_{36} = U\n\na_{37} = U\n\na_{38} = S\n\na_{39} = S\n\na_{40} = U\n\na_{41} = U\n\na_{42} = U\n\na_{43} = U\n\na_{44} = U\n\na_{45} = U\n\na_{46} = U\n\nIn the sequence, from a_{36} to a_{46}, but a_{46} sets y_{47}=9.\n\nAnd for turns: Turn t1: a_{36}, Turn t1+1: a_{37}, ..., up to Turn t1+10: a_{46}, since t1=36, t1+10=46.\n\nt from 0 to 10, 11 actions.\n\nNow, in the output format.\n\nBut let me write the actions clearly.\n\nAlso, in the beginning, I have freeway 8 with two cars, but I didn't need to use, since always safe.\n\nSimilarly, others.\n\nI think this should be fine.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn 36: U\n\nTurn 37: U\n\nTurn 38: S\n\nTurn 39: S\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: U\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: U\n\nTurn 45: U\n\nTurn 46: U\n\nAfter a_{46}=U, y_{47}=9.\n\nNow, to confirm, at turn 46, I am at y=8, and I do U, go to y=9.\n\nAt turn 46, y=8, which is safe, and action U.\n\nNo issue.\n\nPerhaps I can have fewer S actions, but in this case, I have two S, but I need them to wait.\n\nIf I could go directly but avoid, but I don't think so.\n\nAnother sequence: suppose I go to y=0 and stay, but slower.\n\nOr, at t=36, I do S, stay at y=0, but then later I have to go up, might be slower.\n\nFor example, t=36: S, y_{37}=0\n\nt=37: U, y_{38}=1\n\nt=38: U, y_{39}=2\n\nt=39: U, y_{40}=3 unsafe? At t=40, y=3, unsafe.\n\nNot good.\n\nt=36: S, y_{37}=0\n\nt=37: S, y_{38}=0\n\nt=38: U, y_{39}=1\n\nt=39: U, y_{40}=2 safe\n\nThen proceed, but I reached y=2 at t=40, same as before but I started later.\n\nThen t=40: U to y=3 at t=41, etc., reach y=9 at t=49 or later, worse.\n\nSo not better.\n\nThus, the sequence is minimal.\n\nSo for the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 36\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by waiting at \\(y = 2\\) during turns 38 and 39 to avoid the unsafe conditions on rows 3, 4, and 5 at turn 40. After turn 40, all actions are \"U\" (up) to reach \\(y = 9\\) as quickly as possible, leveraging that rows 6, 7, and 8 are always safe.\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n\n- Turn 36: U (move to \\(y = 1\\) at turn 37)\n- Turn 37: U (move to \\(y = 2\\) at turn 38)\n- Turn 38: S (stay at \\(y = 2\\) at turn 39)\n- Turn 39: S (stay at \\(y = 2\\) at turn 40)\n- Turn 40: U (move to \\(y = 3\\) at turn 41)\n- Turn 41: U (move to \\(y = 4\\) at turn 42)\n- Turn 42: U (move to \\(y = 5\\) at turn 43)\n- Turn 43: U (move to \\(y = 6\\) at turn 44)\n- Turn 44: U (move to \\(y = 7\\) at turn 45)\n- Turn 45: U (move to \\(y = 8\\) at turn 46)\n- Turn 46: U (move to \\(y = 9\\) at turn 47)\n\nThis sequence ensures that:\n- At turn 40, the player is at \\(y = 2\\), which is safe since row 2 is unsafe only at turn 36.\n- Rows 3, 4, and 5 are avoided at turn 40 when they are unsafe.\n- Rows 6, 7, and 8 are always safe, allowing rapid upward movement.\n- The goal \\((0, 9)\\) is reached at turn 47 with no collisions.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 36: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 37: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 38: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 39: S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 40: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 41: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 42: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 43: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 44: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 45: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 46: U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 37, and the player is at (0,1). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, with actions U (up), D (down), S (stay). The player moves in the y-direction only (vertical axis from 0 to 9). We must avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nImportant: \n- The player updates position at each turn: if action U, then y increases by 1; D decreases by 1; S stays. The player must stay in [0,9], so if at y=0 and action D, it remains 0; similarly at y=9 and action U, it remains 9.\n\n- Collision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and at that turn, the x-coordinate 0 is inside the span of any car on that freeway.\n\n- When moving from y to y' at turn T, note that at turn T the player is still on row y, and then at the next turn (T+1) the player will be on row y'. So at the moment of moving (turn T) we are on the current row y, and we check the cars on row y at turn T. We do not check the row we are moving to until we are actually on that row at the next turn.\n\nCar update:\n- For a car at turn t1 (current turn) with head h, tail tau, direction d (left or right), and speed s.\n- For a future turn T (>= t1), the car's span is:\n  - If left-moving: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n  - If right-moving: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]   [Note: for right-moving, the head is the larger coordinate? But in the input, for right-moving, the car is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). In the update rule for right: \n        Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n    So if originally at t1, the car is from tau to h (with tau < h) and moving right, then at T, it moves to [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut note: in the car state table, for freeway 3,4,5 we have:\n    (-36, -47, right, 12) -> so head=-36, tail=-47? That would imply that the car is from -47 to -36? But that is a length of 11? Actually, the head is the front of the car. For a right-moving car, the head is the rightmost point? Then the tail is the leftmost? So the car spans [tail, head] = [-47, -36] at t1=37.\n\nSimilarly, the other car on freeway 3: (48,37,right,12) -> head=48, tail=37? Then the car is [37,48]. And (12,1,right,12) -> [1,12].\n\nBut note: the update rule for right-moving: \n    Span(T) = [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\nSo for the car (12,1,right,12) at t1=37: \n    At T, the span is [1 + 12*(T-37), 12 + 12*(T-37)]\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: \n    The car (-60,-25,left,36) at t1=37: \n        Span(T) = [h - 36*(T-37), tau - 36*(T-37)] = [-60 -36*(T-37), -25 -36*(T-37)]\n\nWe are at turn T (starting at T=37). The player starts at y=1. We need to get to y=9.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at a turn T when there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nNote: We are only at one freeway per turn. And we are not on a freeway when we are at y=0 or y=9.\n\nStrategy:\nWe want to minimize the number of turns. The minimal moves in terms of vertical steps: we are at y=1 and need to get to y=9. That requires 8 moves upward. But we might have to wait (use S) to avoid cars. Also, we can move down to avoid a car? But moving down would take us away from the goal. So we have to balance.\n\nWe can consider a BFS (breadth-first search) over states (turn, y) and simulate the moves, checking for collisions at each step. But note: the turns are unbounded? Actually, we can bound the number of turns because the cars are moving and eventually the cars will pass? But we want minimal turns.\n\nHowever, note that the cars are moving at high speeds and the road is infinite? But the collision condition is only at x=0. So we can compute for each freeway and each turn T (relative to t1=37) whether at turn T, the freeway has a car that covers x=0.\n\nWe'll precompute for each freeway (1 to 8) and for a range of turns (starting from 37, and going until we have a safe path) the presence of a car at x=0.\n\nBut note: the problem might be that we have to wait until a car passes? Since the cars are moving, the condition is only at specific times.\n\nLet me compute for each freeway the intervals of time (turns) during which there is a car covering x=0.\n\nFreeway 1: \n    Car: (-60, -25, left, 36)\n    At turn T (relative to 37: let dT = T-37), the span is:\n        left: [ -60 - 36*dT, -25 - 36*dT ]\n        We require 0 in [ -60-36dT, -25-36dT ]?\n        So: -60-36dT <= 0 <= -25-36dT\n        => 0 >= -60-36dT => 36dT >= -60 -> dT >= -60/36 -> dT >= -1.66, which is always true for dT>=0.\n        and 0 <= -25-36dT => 36dT <= -25 -> dT <= -25/36 -> which is negative. \n        So no solution? \n\nWait, let me write the inequalities correctly:\n\nThe car covers x=0 if:\n    -60 - 36*dT <= 0 <= -25 - 36*dT\n\nBut note: for a left-moving car, the head is at the left? Actually, the head is the front. For a left-moving car, the head is the leftmost? Then the tail is the rightmost? Then the car spans [head, tail] = [-60, -25] at T=37? Then when moving left, the entire car moves left.\n\nSo the condition for covering x=0 at turn T:\n    head - 36*dT <= 0 <= tail - 36*dT\n    => -60 -36*dT <= 0 <= -25 -36*dT\n\nSolve first inequality: -60 -36*dT <= 0  => 36*dT >= -60 => dT >= -60/36 = -5/3 ≈ -1.666 -> since dT>=0, this holds.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= -25 -36*dT => 36*dT <= -25 -> which is impossible because dT>=0.\n\nSo this car never covers x=0? \n\nBut wait, the car is entirely to the left of 0? At T=37: the car is from -60 to -25, which is entirely negative. And it's moving left, so it moves further left. So indeed, it never reaches x=0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same car -> same situation: never covers x=0.\n\nFreeway 3,4,5: each has three cars.\n\nFor freeway 3 (and similarly 4,5) at turn T:\n\nCar1: (-36, -47, right, 12) -> note: head=-36, tail=-47? But for a right-moving car, the head is the rightmost? Then the car at t1=37 is from tail to head: [-47, -36]. \n    Update: at T, [ -47 + 12*dT, -36 + 12*dT ]\n    Condition: -47+12*dT <= 0 <= -36+12*dT\n    => 12*dT <= 36 -> dT <= 3\n        and 12*dT >= 47 -> dT >= 47/12 ≈ 3.916 -> no integer dT satisfies both? \n\nLet me compute:\n    Lower bound: -47+12*dT <= 0 -> 12*dT <= 47 -> dT <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916 -> so dT <= 3\n    Upper bound: 0 <= -36+12*dT -> 12*dT >= 36 -> dT>=3\n    So dT must be at least 3 and at most 3.916. Only integer dT=3? \n    Check dT=3: \n        span: [-47+12*3, -36+12*3] = [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11, 0]\n        So 0 is included? The condition says: the span is [a,b] and we require a<=0<=b. \n        Here, -11<=0<=0 -> yes, 0 is included.\n\n    dT=4: [-47+48, -36+48] = [1,12] -> 0 is not included.\n\nSo at dT=3 (turn 37+3=40) this car covers x=0.\n\nCar2: (48,37,right,12) -> head=48, tail=37 -> car at t1=37: [37,48]\n    Update: [37+12*dT, 48+12*dT] -> always positive? So 0 is never covered.\n\nCar3: (12,1,right,12) -> head=12, tail=1 -> car at t1=37: [1,12]\n    Update: [1+12*dT, 12+12*dT] -> always positive? So 0 is never covered.\n\nTherefore, for freeway 3, only at turn T=40 (dT=3) there is a car (the first one) covering x=0.\n\nBut wait: the car at dT=3: the span is [-11,0] -> so x=0 is covered. \n\nSimilarly, for freeway 4 and 5: same car configuration? So they also have the same car that covers x=0 at turn 40.\n\nNow freeway 6 and 7: \n    Car: (-48, -59, right, 6) -> head=-48, tail=-59 -> so the car at t1=37: [-59,-48]\n    Update: [-59+6*dT, -48+6*dT]\n    Condition: -59+6*dT <= 0 <= -48+6*dT\n        => 6*dT <= 48 -> dT<=8\n        and 6*dT >= 59 -> dT>=59/6≈9.833 -> no integer dT satisfies.\n\nSo no collision on freeway 6 and 7.\n\nFreeway 8: \n    Car1: (-48, -59, right, 6) -> same as above: no collision.\n    Car2: (18,7,right,6) -> head=18, tail=7 -> car at t1=37: [7,18]\n        Update: [7+6*dT, 18+6*dT] -> always positive? So no collision.\n\nTherefore, the only dangerous turns are on freeways 3,4,5 at turn 40 (relative dT=3, so absolute turn 40) for the player if they are on freeway 3,4, or 5 at turn 40.\n\nBut note: we are at turn 37 at y=1. We need to get to y=9.\n\nWe can plan:\n\nWe start at y=1 at turn 37.\n\nWe must avoid being on freeway 3,4, or 5 at turn 40 (which is 3 turns from now).\n\nWhat are the possible positions at turn 40?\n\nWe are at y=1 at turn37.\n\nWe can take 3 actions: each can be U, D, or S.\n\nWe want to be at y=9 as soon as possible. The minimal moves is 8 ups. But we can do 8 consecutive ups? But we have to avoid the danger at turn40.\n\nAt turn40, we must not be on freeway 3,4,5. So we must be either below 3 (y=0,1,2) or above 5 (y=6,7,8,9). But note: freeway numbers are the y-coordinates: freeway1 is y=1, freeway2 is y=2, ..., freeway8 is y=8.\n\nSo at turn40, we must avoid y=3,4,5.\n\nWe are at y=1 at turn37. We have 3 moves: turn37 (action at turn37: for the move that happens at turn37 and results in position at turn38), turn38 (to turn39), turn39 (to turn40). So the position at turn40 is the result of 3 moves.\n\nLet me denote the state at turn t: y(t)\n\nt37: y=1\n\nAfter action at t37: \n    if U: y38 = 2\n    if D: y38 = 0 (because cannot go below 0) -> but note: at y=1, D goes to 0? \n    if S: y38 = 1\n\nSimilarly for next moves.\n\nWe have to avoid at turn40: y(40) not in {3,4,5}.\n\nWe also must avoid collisions at every turn from 37 to the time we reach 9. But note: the only danger we know is at turn40 on freeways 3,4,5. Are there any other dangers? \n\nWe computed that only at turn40 on freeways 3,4,5 there is a car. But we must also check for other turns? \n\nLet me reexamine the car movements for other turns? \n\nFor freeway3,4,5: we have a car that covers x=0 only at turn40? And for other freeways, no car ever covers x=0? \n\nSo the only collision risk is at turn40 if we are on freeway 3,4, or 5.\n\nTherefore, we must not be on y=3,4,5 at turn40.\n\nWe are at y=1 at turn37. We have three moves (t37, t38, t39) to determine y40.\n\nWe want to get to y=9 as fast as possible. So we would like to move up as much as possible. But at turn40 we must avoid y=3,4,5.\n\nPossible paths:\n\nWe need to be at y40 not in {3,4,5}. The goal is y=9, so we want to be as high as possible.\n\nThe maximum we can go in 3 moves: 3 ups: \n    t37: U -> y38=2\n    t38: U -> y39=3\n    t39: U -> y40=4 -> but 4 is in {3,4,5}? Actually 4 is in the forbidden set? So we cannot do three ups.\n\nTwo ups and one stay: \n    Possibilities:\n        U, U, S: \n            t37: U -> y38=2\n            t38: U -> y39=3\n            t39: S -> y40=3 -> forbidden.\n        U, S, U: \n            t37: U -> y38=2\n            t38: S -> y39=2\n            t39: U -> y40=3 -> forbidden.\n        S, U, U:\n            t37: S -> y38=1\n            t38: U -> y39=2\n            t39: U -> y40=3 -> forbidden.\n\nOne up and two stays: \n    U, S, S: y40=2 -> safe (y=2 is freeway2, which is safe at turn40).\n    S, U, S: y40=2\n    S, S, U: y40=2\n\nBut then we are at y40=2, which is safe. Then we can start moving up.\n\nBut we want minimal turns. The goal is to get to y=9.\n\nFrom y40=2, we need 7 more ups. So total turns = 3 (to get to turn40 at y2) + 7 = 10 turns? But note: the actions are taken at turns: we have already taken 3 actions (at turns 37,38,39) to get to y40=2. Then we need 7 more actions to go from 2 to 9: 7 ups. So the total actions: 10 actions, and we reach y=9 at turn 37+10-1? \n\nLet me clarify: \n    Turn37: first action -> position at turn38\n    Turn38: second action -> position at turn39\n    Turn39: third action -> position at turn40\n    ...\n    After H actions (at turns 37,38,...,37+H-1), we are at position at turn37+H.\n\nWe require that at turn37+H, we are at y=9.\n\nIf we do 10 actions, then we are at turn37+10? But the last action is at turn37+9, and then the position is at turn37+10.\n\nWe want the position at turn37+H to be 9? Actually, the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then the position at the end of these H actions (after the last action) is at turn t1+H? \n\nThe update: \n    At turn t, we take action a_t, then the position at turn t+1 is updated.\n\nSo at the start of turn t1=37, we are at (0,1). Then we take action a_37 -> then at turn38, we are at y38 = y37 + Delta.\n\nSo after H actions (at turns 37, 38, ..., 37+H-1), we are at turn 37+H.\n\nWe require y_{37+H} = 9.\n\nSo if we take 10 actions, we are at turn37+10.\n\nBut note: the minimal without obstacles would be 8 actions: 8 ups, then at turn37+8 we are at y=9.\n\nBut we have an obstacle at turn40 (which is 37+3 = 40) so we cannot be at y=3,4,5 at turn40.\n\nIn the 8-ups plan: \n    At turn37: action U -> turn38: y=2\n    turn38: U -> turn39: y=3\n    turn39: U -> turn40: y=4 -> collision? because at turn40 we are at y=4, which is freeway4, and at turn40 there is a car at freeway4? -> collision.\n\nSo we must avoid that.\n\nWe considered a path that at turn40 we are at y=2. Then we do 7 more ups: \n    turn40: U -> turn41: y=3\n    turn41: U -> turn42: y=4\n    turn42: U -> turn43: y=5\n    turn43: U -> turn44: y=6\n    turn44: U -> turn45: y=7\n    turn45: U -> turn46: y=8\n    turn46: U -> turn47: y=9\n\nSo total actions: from turn37 to turn46 (inclusive) -> 10 actions.\n\nBut is there a faster way? \n\nAlternative: can we be at turn40 at a safe y above 5? \n\nFor example, if we do more than 3 moves? But we only have 3 moves to get from y=1 to somewhere at turn40.\n\nThe maximum we can go in 3 moves: 3 ups -> y=4 (forbidden) or if we start with two ups and then one down? \n\nBut we are at y=1. \n    Option: \n        t37: U -> y38=2\n        t38: U -> y39=3\n        t39: D -> y40=2 -> safe (y=2 at turn40) -> same as before.\n\nOr:\n        t37: U -> y38=2\n        t38: D -> y39=1\n        t39: U -> y40=2 -> safe.\n\nOr:\n        t37: D -> y38=0\n        t38: U -> y39=1\n        t39: U -> y40=2 -> safe.\n\nBut we are still at y=2 at turn40.\n\nCan we get to y=6 at turn40? \n    We start at y=1. To get to y=6 in 3 moves: we need 5 net ups. But we can only do at most 3 ups -> maximum y=4 -> not possible.\n\nSo we cannot be above 5 at turn40? The safe zone above is y>=6? But we can't reach y=6 in 3 moves.\n\nTherefore, we must be at y=0,1, or 2 at turn40.\n\nBut note: if we are at y=0 at turn40, that's safe (not a freeway). Similarly, y=1 and y=2 are freeway1 and freeway2, but we saw they are safe at turn40.\n\nSo the only safe positions at turn40 are y=0,1,2,6,7,8,9. But we can only reach y=0,1,2.\n\nNow, we want to minimize the total turns. So we want to get to 9 as fast as possible.\n\nAfter turn40, we can start moving up. But note: we must also avoid any other collisions? We have checked that only turn40 has a collision? \n\nBut what about later turns? We must ensure that when we are moving up, we don't run into another car? However, we have analyzed that no car covers x=0 at any other turn? \n\nBut wait: we must check for the freeways we traverse at every turn. For example, when we are at y=3 at turn41, is there a car at freeway3 at turn41? \n\nLet me check freeway3 at turn41 (dT=4): \n    Car1: [-47+12*4, -36+12*4] = [-47+48, -36+48] = [1,12] -> 0 not included? safe.\n    Car2: [37+12*4, 48+12*4] = [37+48,48+48] = [85,96] -> safe.\n    Car3: [1+12*4,12+12*4] = [49,60] -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway4 and 5: same.\n\nBut what about freeway3 at other turns? We know at dT=3 (turn40) it was dangerous. At other dT? \n\nWe had: for car1 on freeway3: \n    Condition: dT must be in [3, 3.916) -> only dT=3 is dangerous? \n\nSimilarly, the other cars never cover 0.\n\nSo freeway3,4,5 are safe at all turns except turn40.\n\nTherefore, after turn40, we can freely move through freeways 3,4,5 without waiting.\n\nSo the plan: \n    We must avoid freeways 3,4,5 at turn40 (only at that turn). Then after turn40, we can move up without delay.\n\nThe minimal path: we want to get to y=9 as fast as possible. \n\nWe have two phases: \n   Phase1: from turn37 to turn40 (3 moves) to get to a safe y (0,1,2) at turn40.\n   Phase2: from turn40 onward, move up to 9.\n\nThe minimal moves in phase2: 9 - y40. We want to minimize the total moves, so we want y40 as high as possible. The highest safe y40 is 2.\n\nSo we should aim to be at y=2 at turn40.\n\nHow to get from y=1 at turn37 to y=2 at turn40 in 3 moves? \n\nWe need to end at y=2. The net change: +1.\n\nWe can do:\n    Option1: U, S, S: \n        t37: U -> y38=2\n        t38: S -> y39=2\n        t39: S -> y40=2 -> safe.\n\n    Option2: S, U, S: \n        t37: S -> y38=1\n        t38: U -> y39=2\n        t39: S -> y40=2\n\n    Option3: S, S, U: \n        t37: S -> y38=1\n        t38: S -> y39=1\n        t39: U -> y40=2\n\n    Option4: D, U, U: \n        t37: D -> y38=0\n        t38: U -> y39=1\n        t39: U -> y40=2\n\nAll these are safe at every step? \n\nWe must check collisions at every turn from 37 to 40.\n\nAt turn37: we are at y=1 (freeway1). But we have freeway1: no car at any time? -> safe.\n\nAt turn38: we are at y? \n    In option1: at turn38 we are at y=2 -> freeway2: safe at any time? (we saw freeway2 has a car that never covers 0) -> safe.\n    In option2: at turn38 we are at y=1 -> freeway1: safe.\n    In option3: at turn38: y=1 -> safe; turn39: y=1 -> safe.\n    In option4: turn38: y=0 (not a freeway) -> safe; turn39: y=1 -> safe.\n\nAt turn40: we are at y=2 -> freeway2: safe.\n\nSo all are safe.\n\nWe choose the one that doesn't waste moves? They all take 3 moves to get to y=2 at turn40. Then from y=2 we need 7 ups.\n\nTotal moves: 3 (for phase1) + 7 (for phase2) = 10.\n\nBut can we do better? \n\nWhat if we go to y=0 at turn40? Then we need 9 moves to get to 9 -> total 3+9=12 -> worse.\n\nOr y=1: then 8 moves -> 3+8=11 -> still worse than 10.\n\nSo the best is to be at y=2 at turn40.\n\nBut note: we can also consider being at y=2 at turn40, but then we do 7 ups. \n\nHowever, we must check the moves after turn40: \n\nAt turn40: we are at y=2. Then we do:\n    turn40: U -> y41=3\n    turn41: U -> y42=4\n    turn42: U -> y43=5\n    turn43: U -> y44=6\n    turn44: U -> y45=7\n    turn45: U -> y46=8\n    turn46: U -> y47=9\n\nSo we reach y=9 at turn47.\n\nTotal actions: from turn37 to turn46: that's 10 actions.\n\nBut is there a way to get to 9 in less than 10 turns? \n\nWhat if we avoid the collision by being at a safe y at turn40, but we start moving up earlier? \n\nFor example, can we be at y=3 at a turn that is not 40? \n\nBut the only danger is at turn40 on freeways 3,4,5. So we can be at y=3 at turn39? and then at turn40 we move to y=4? \n\nBut note: at turn40, we are at y=4 -> that is exactly the danger! \n\nAlternatively, we can be at y=3 at turn41? \n\nBut we have to get to y=3 at turn41 without being at y=3,4,5 at turn40.\n\nHow? \n\nWe are at y=1 at turn37. \n\nWe can do:\n    t37: U -> y38=2\n    t38: U -> y39=3 -> at turn39 we are at y=3 -> freeway3. Is freeway3 safe at turn39? \n        For freeway3 at turn39 (dT=2): \n            Car1: [-47+12*2, -36+12*2] = [-47+24, -36+24] = [-23,-12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n        Car2 and Car3: safe as before.\n        So safe.\n    Then at turn39: we are at y=3. Now at turn39, we take an action. We cannot stay at y=3 at turn40? because then we would be at y=3 at turn40 -> collision? \n\nBut note: if we take an action at turn39 that moves us to y=4 at turn40? Then at turn40 we are at y=4 -> collision.\n\nIf we take an action that moves us to y=2 at turn40? Then we avoid the collision at turn40. \n\nSo:\n    t39: D -> y40=2 -> safe.\n\nThen we are at y=2 at turn40. Then we still have to go up from 2 to 9: 7 moves. Total moves: \n    t37: U\n    t38: U\n    t39: D\n    then 7 U's -> total 10 moves.\n\nBut we are at y=2 at turn40, same as before.\n\nAlternatively, can we get to y=4 at a safe time? \n\nBut we cannot be at y=4 at turn40. So we have to pass y=4 at a different turn. \n\nFor example, if we delay the move to y=4 until after turn40? \n\nBut we are forced to be at a safe y at turn40. \n\nAnother idea: can we go above y=5 at turn40? We can't in 3 moves.\n\nWhat if we do more than 3 moves? But we have to be at a safe y at turn40. \n\nAlternatively, we can wait at a safe y until turn40 has passed? \n\nBut we are already constrained to be at a safe y at turn40. \n\nSo the minimal is 10 moves? \n\nBut let me check: what if we do 8 moves in a different pattern? \n\nFor example: \n    We avoid the collision by being at y=2 at turn40, but then we do 7 ups. \n\nBut note: we can do the 7 ups consecutively? \n\nIs there any danger? \n\nAfter turn40, the freeways 3,4,5 are safe at all turns. So we can move freely.\n\nSo the plan: \n    We choose one of the safe sequences for the first three moves to get to y=2 at turn40.\n\nThen we do 7 ups.\n\nFor example, using option1: \n    t37: U -> to y=2\n    t38: S -> stay at y=2\n    t39: S -> stay at y=2\n    then t40: U -> to y=3\n    t41: U -> to y=4\n    t42: U -> to y=5\n    t43: U -> to y=6\n    t44: U -> to y=7\n    t45: U -> to y=8\n    t46: U -> to y=9\n\nSo the sequence of actions for 10 moves: \n    Turn37: U\n    Turn38: S\n    Turn39: S\n    Turn40: U\n    Turn41: U\n    Turn42: U\n    Turn43: U\n    Turn44: U\n    Turn45: U\n    Turn46: U\n\nBut we can also choose a sequence that doesn't have so many stays? \n\nFor example, we can do option2: \n    t37: S -> y38=1\n    t38: U -> y39=2\n    t39: S -> y40=2\n    then the same: \n    t40: U ->3\n    t41: U->4\n    ... until t46: U->9\n\nTotal moves: 10.\n\nBut we can also do:\n\n    t37: U -> y38=2\n    t38: S -> y39=2\n    t39: S -> y40=2 -> then 7 ups.\n\nOr:\n\n    t37: U ->2\n    t38: U ->3 -> safe? at turn38: dT=1? \n        Check freeway3 at turn38 (dT=1): \n            Car1: [-47+12*1, -36+12*1] = [-35,-24] -> safe.\n        So safe.\n    t39: D -> y40=2 -> safe.\n\nThen: \n    t40: U ->3\n    t41: U->4\n    ... same.\n\nSo we can do: \n    t37: U\n    t38: U\n    t39: D\n    t40: U\n    t41: U\n    ... until t46: U (7 ups from t40 to t46)\n\nTotal: 10 moves.\n\nBut note: in this sequence, at turn39 we are at y=3? Then we do D to go to y=2 at turn40. \n\nBut at turn39: we are at y=3 -> freeway3. We checked at turn39 (dT=2) it was safe. \n\nSo that sequence is also safe.\n\nWe want the minimal number of turns? All these are 10 moves.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in 9 moves? \n\nSuppose we want to reach y=9 at turn37+9 = turn46.\n\nWe start at y=1 at turn37. We need net +8.\n\nBut we have 9 moves: so we can have 8 ups and 1 stay (or 8 ups and 1 down, but down would be counterproductive).\n\nBut we must avoid being at y=3,4,5 at turn40.\n\nTurn40 is the 4th state: \n    turn37: start y=1\n    after 1st move (t37): y38\n    after 2nd: y39\n    after 3rd: y40\n\nWe require y40 not in {3,4,5}.\n\nWe then have 6 more moves to get to y=9.\n\nThe net after 9 moves: we must have at least 8 ups to go from 1 to 9? Because 1+8=9. So we must have exactly 8 ups and 1 non-up (either S or D). But D would make us go down, so we would need more than 8 ups? So the non-up must be a stay.\n\nSo we must have 8 ups and 1 stay.\n\nNow, the position at turn40 is determined by the first 3 moves.\n\nWe start at y=1.\n\nLet u1, u2, u3 be the moves at t37, t38, t39 (each in {U, D, S}).\n\nThe net displacement after 3 moves: \n    y40 = 1 + (number of U in first three) - (number of D in first three)\n\nWe require y40 not in {3,4,5}.\n\nAnd we have a total of 8 ups and 1 stay in 9 moves. So in the first 3 moves, we have some number of ups, say k, and then in the last 6 moves we have 8-k ups? But we only have 6 moves left? So 8-k <=6 -> k>=2.\n\nSimilarly, the total number of downs: we have 9 moves: 8 ups, 1 stay, 0 downs. So no downs.\n\nSo the moves: 8 ups and 1 stay.\n\nThe stay must be one of the moves. \n\nNow, the first three moves: we have 3 moves: which can be ups or stays? But we have only one stay in the entire sequence. \n\nPossibilities for the first three moves: \n    We can have 0,1,2, or 3 ups? But we have only one stay in total, so the first three moves can have at most one stay? \n\nBut we have 8 ups to distribute over 9 moves. The stay can be in any of the 9 moves.\n\nSo in the first three moves, we can have either 3 ups, or 2 ups and 1 stay, or 1 up and 2 stays? But we only have one stay in total. So if we use a stay in the first three, then the last six must be all ups? \n\nCase 1: the stay is in the first three moves. Then the first three moves: 2 ups and 1 stay -> net displacement: +2 -> y40=1+2=3 -> forbidden.\n\nCase 2: the stay is not in the first three. Then the first three moves are all ups: y40=1+3=4 -> forbidden.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to do it in 9 moves.\n\nSo minimal is 10 moves.\n\nNow, we can choose any sequence that gets us to y=2 at turn40 and then 7 ups.\n\nBut we must also check that during the moves we are safe? \n\nFor example, when we move up from y=2 to y=3 at turn40, we are at y=3 at turn41. We already checked that freeway3 at turn41 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, when we are at y=4 at turn42: freeway4 at turn42 (dT=5): \n    For freeway4: same as freeway3? \n        Car1: [-47+12*5, -36+12*5] = [-47+60, -36+60] = [13,24] -> safe.\n    Other cars: safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 at turn43: freeway5 at turn43 (dT=6): \n        Car1: [-47+12*6, -36+12*6] = [-47+72, -36+72] = [25,36] -> safe.\n\nSo the entire path is safe.\n\nNow, we can write the sequence.\n\nWe have several options for the first three moves. Let's choose one that minimizes the number of stays? \n\nFor example: \n    Option: U, U, D: \n        t37: U -> y38=2\n        t38: U -> y39=3\n        t39: D -> y40=2\n\nThen the rest: \n        t40: U -> y41=3\n        t41: U -> y42=4\n        t42: U -> y43=5\n        t43: U -> y44=6\n        t44: U -> y45=7\n        t45: U -> y46=8\n        t46: U -> y47=9\n\nBut note: we need 10 actions, so the last action is at turn46, and we are at y9 at turn47.\n\nBut the problem: we are to output the actions from turn37 to turn37+9? \n\nTotal H=10 actions: at turns 37,38,...,46.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn37: U\nTurn38: U\nTurn39: D\nTurn40: U\nTurn41: U\nTurn42: U\nTurn43: U\nTurn44: U\nTurn45: U\nTurn46: U\n\nBut wait: at turn39: we do D -> that is a down. Is that acceptable? It doesn't cause any problem? \n\nWe must check collision at every step:\n\nTurn37: we start at y=1 -> after action U, at turn38 we are at y=2.\n    At turn38: we are at freeway2 -> safe (no car at any time).\n\nTurn38: at y=2, we do U -> at turn39 we are at y=3.\n    At turn39: freeway3 -> we checked: safe.\n\nTurn39: at y=3, we do D -> at turn40 we are at y=2.\n    At turn40: freeway2 -> safe.\n\nThen the rest: moving up: each step we are at a freeway that is safe at that turn.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nWe could avoid the down by using stays? But that would be the same number of moves.\n\nBut the problem: we are to minimize H, which is 10. \n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n    t37: U -> y38=2\n    t38: S -> y39=2\n    t39: S -> y40=2\n    t40: U ->3\n    t41: U->4\n    ... same.\n\nThis sequence has two stays. \n\nBut we prefer the one without extra stays? But the problem doesn't specify to minimize the number of non-up moves, only the total turns.\n\nSo both are acceptable.\n\nBut the one with the down might be less desirable? But it is safe.\n\nHowever, note that at turn39 we are at y=3 and then we move down. But we are allowed to move down.\n\nI think the sequence with the down is acceptable.\n\nBut let me check if we can do without the down and without extra stays? \n\nWe want to be at y=2 at turn40. We start at y=1.\n\nWe can do:\n    t37: S -> y38=1\n    t38: U -> y39=2\n    t39: S -> y40=2\n\nThen the rest: 7 ups.\n\nThis has two stays and no downs.\n\nWhich one to choose? Either is fine.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". We have two sequences of 10 moves. So we can choose any.\n\nI'll choose the one without the down: \n    Turn37: S\n    Turn38: U\n    Turn39: S\n    Turn40: U\n    Turn41: U\n    Turn42: U\n    Turn43: U\n    Turn44: U\n    Turn45: U\n    Turn46: U\n\nBut wait: at turn40 we do U -> then at turn41 we are at y=3. \n    Check freeway3 at turn41 (dT=4): safe.\n\nSo that's fine.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n    Turn37: U\n    Turn38: S\n    Turn39: S\n    Turn40: U\n    ... same.\n\nI'll write the first one I thought of without the down: \n\n    Turn37: S\n    Turn38: U\n    Turn39: S\n    Then 7 ups.\n\nBut let me write the full sequence:\n\n    Turn37: S   -> at turn38: y=1\n    Turn38: U   -> at turn39: y=2\n    Turn39: S   -> at turn40: y=2\n    Turn40: U   -> at turn41: y=3\n    Turn41: U   -> at turn42: y=4\n    Turn42: U   -> at turn43: y=5\n    Turn43: U   -> at turn44: y=6\n    Turn44: U   -> at turn45: y=7\n    Turn45: U   -> at turn46: y=8\n    Turn46: U   -> at turn47: y=9\n\nBut note: we have 10 actions, and we are at y=9 at turn47.\n\nBut the problem: we are at (0,9) at the end. \n\nIs there a sequence that ends earlier? We argued 10 is minimal.\n\nBut note: the initial state is at turn37, and we are at y=1. We take an action at turn37, which moves us to the next turn. \n\nThe sequence: 10 actions: turns 37 to 46.\n\nBut we could do the 7 ups without the last stay? \n\nAnother idea: can we be at y=9 at turn46? \n\nWe require 10 actions? \n\nAfter 10 actions, we are at turn47. \n\nBut we want to be at y=9 at turn37+H, and we take H actions. \n\nWe have H=10, so we are at turn37+10 = 47.\n\nBut we want to minimize H. We have shown 10 is minimal.\n\nWe can try to be at y=9 at turn46? \n\nThat would be after 9 actions? But we showed that 9 actions are impossible.\n\nSo we output a sequence of 10 actions.\n\nNow, we must write the actions for turns: 37,38,...,46.\n\nI'll choose the sequence:\n\n    Turn37: S\n    Turn38: U\n    Turn39: S\n    Turn40: U\n    Turn41: U\n    Turn42: U\n    Turn43: U\n    Turn44: U\n    Turn45: U\n    Turn46: U\n\nBut at turn39 we do S, so we are at y=2 at turn40. Then we start moving up.\n\nBut we can also do:\n\n    Turn37: U\n    Turn38: S\n    Turn39: S\n    Turn40: U\n    Turn41: U\n    ... same.\n\nI think both are fine.\n\nTo avoid staying at y=1 at the first move? We can do the first option.\n\nBut let's do the one with the down? \n\n    Turn37: U\n    Turn38: U\n    Turn39: D\n    Turn40: U\n    Turn41: U\n    Turn42: U\n    Turn43: U\n    Turn44: U\n    Turn45: U\n    Turn46: U\n\nThis one: \n    At turn37: U -> to y=2 at turn38: safe.\n    Turn38: U -> to y=3 at turn39: we checked safe.\n    Turn39: D -> to y=2 at turn40: safe.\n    Then the rest: ups.\n\nThis sequence uses a down, but it is valid.\n\nI think the problem doesn't forbid moving down. \n\nBut to be safe, we can choose the one without down.\n\nI'll choose without down: \n\n    Turn37: S\n    Turn38: U\n    Turn39: S\n    Turn40: U\n    Turn41: U\n    Turn42: U\n    Turn43: U\n    Turn44: U\n    Turn45: U\n    Turn46: U\n\nNow, write the answer.\n\nBut note: the answer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n...\n}\n\nHere t1=37.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn37: S\nTurn38: U\nTurn39: S\nTurn40: U\nTurn41: U\nTurn42: U\nTurn43: U\nTurn44: U\nTurn45: U\nTurn46: U\n\nBut wait, the last turn is t1+9? because we have 10 actions: from t1 to t1+9.\n\nt1=37, so the last action is at 37+9=46.\n\nWe can write:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 37: S\nTurn 38: U\nTurn 39: S\nTurn 40: U\nTurn 41: U\nTurn 42: U\nTurn 43: U\nTurn 44: U\nTurn 45: U\nTurn 46: U\n}\n\nThis is a sequence of 10 actions.\n\nWe can confirm the positions:\n\nt37: start at y=1.\nAfter t37: S -> y=1 at t38.\nt38: U -> y=2 at t39.\nt39: S -> y=2 at t40. (safe)\nt40: U -> y=3 at t41.\nt41: U -> y=4 at t42.\nt42: U -> y=5 at t43.\nt43: U -> y=6 at t44.\nt44: U -> y=7 at t45.\nt45: U -> y=8 at t46.\nt46: U -> y=9 at t47.\n\nAnd we are done.\n\nSo the minimal H is 10.\n\nFinal answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) is 10. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), particularly ensuring the player is not on freeways 3, 4, or 5 at turn 40 (when cars cover \\(x = 0\\)).\n\n- At turn 37, the player is at \\((0, 1)\\). Action \\(S\\) (stay) keeps the player at \\(y = 1\\) for turn 38. Freeway 1 is safe at all turns.\n- At turn 38, action \\(U\\) (up) moves the player to \\(y = 2\\) for turn 39. Freeway 2 is safe at all turns.\n- At turn 39, action \\(S\\) (stay) keeps the player at \\(y = 2\\) for turn 40. This avoids freeways 3, 4, and 5 at turn 40, which is critical.\n- From turn 40 to turn 46, actions \\(U\\) move the player up one row per turn. Freeways 3, 4, and 5 are safe after turn 40, and no other freeways have cars covering \\(x = 0\\) at any turn.\n\nThe sequence ensures the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\) at turn 47 (after 10 actions).\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 37: \\text{ } S \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 38: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 39: \\text{ } S \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 40: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 41: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 42: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 43: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 44: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 45: \\text{ } U \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 46: \\text{ } U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 38, and the player is at (0,1). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns H, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The movement is only in the y-direction (vertical) and the x=0 is fixed. The grid for y is 0 to 9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T only if the player is on a freeway y_T (which is between 1 and 8) and at that same turn T, there is a car on that freeway such that the car's span at turn T includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player).\n\nImportant: when the player moves from y to y' at turn T, then at turn T the player is still on y (so we check for collision on freeway y at turn T). Then at the next turn, the player will be on y'. So the movement is instantaneous only at the turn boundary? Actually, the update is: at turn T, the player chooses an action, and then the new position y_{T+1} is set. Then at turn T, the player is at y_T, and at turn T+1, at y_{T+1}.\n\nSo at each turn T, we are at y_T. We choose an action that will lead to y_{T+1} = y_T + delta, but note that during the entire turn T, we are at y_T. Therefore, we must avoid being on a freeway (1 to 8) at a turn T when there is a car on that freeway at T that has 0 in its span at T.\n\nCar update:\nFor a car at turn t1 (current turn) with head h, tail tau, direction d, and speed s, then at turn T (>= t1), the span is:\n- If left-moving: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]   (note: since the car moves left, the entire segment moves left by s per turn)\n- If right-moving: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]   (because in the initial state, the car is from tau to h (with tau < h) and moves right, so each turn the entire segment moves right by s.\n\nBut note: for left-moving, the head is at the right end? Actually, the problem states:\n- Left-moving: at t1: span is [h, tau] -> but note that if the car is moving left, then the head (front) is at the left? Actually, the problem says: \"head is at h, tail is at tau\". For left-moving, the head is the front? Then as the car moves left, the head decreases. Similarly, for right-moving, the head is at h and the tail at tau, and as it moves right, both increase.\n\nBut the representation of the span: \n- For left-moving: the span at t1 is [h, tau] meaning from h to tau? But if the car is moving left, then h (head) should be the leftmost? Actually, the problem says: \n  Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> then at T: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\nBut note: if the car is moving left, then the head (front) is at the left? So the head should be the smaller coordinate? But then the tail would be to the right? Actually, the problem does not specify which one is left or right. However, the update rule tells us: for left-moving, both head and tail are decreasing. Similarly, for right-moving, both are increasing.\n\nBut the problem says for left-moving: [h, tau] becomes [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt]. So if at t1 the car is [h, tau] and then at T it's [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt], then if h > tau, then the span is from h to tau (which is backwards) but actually the car is a contiguous segment. So we must interpret the span as the interval [min, max]? But the problem does not say that. It says \"span\" and then gives an interval. However, the collision condition is: if 0 is in the span at turn T.\n\nTherefore, we must note that the span is a contiguous interval. For left-moving, the head is the rightmost and the tail the leftmost? That would make sense: because when moving left, the head (front) is at the left? Actually, no: if the car is moving left, then the front (head) is at the left? Then the head should be the leftmost. But in the update: if head is at h and the car moves left, then the new head becomes h - s*dt. So that makes sense: the head is the leading part (which is the leftmost for left movement). Similarly, the tail is behind (to the right). But then the span would be [h, tau] but with h < tau? Because the head is left and tail is right? But the problem writes [h, tau] and then subtracts the same amount. Then if h < tau, then [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt] is the entire segment.\n\nAlternatively, if the car is long, then the head and tail might be such that the head is the front and the tail is the back. For left-moving, the front is at a smaller x than the back? Actually, no: if the car is moving left, then the front is the leftmost and the back is the rightmost. So the head (front) is at x = h and the tail (back) is at x = tau, and h < tau? Then the span is [h, tau]. Then when moving left by s per turn, both h and tau decrease by s per turn.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: the head (front) is at the right? Then the head is at a larger x than the tail. So the span is [tau, head] = [tau, h] with tau < h. Then when moving right, both increase by s per turn: so [tau + s*dt, h + s*dt].\n\nBut in the problem, for right-moving, the initial span is given as [tau, h]? Actually, the problem says: for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" -> then becomes [tau + s*dt, h + s*dt]. So that matches.\n\nTherefore, we can interpret:\n- For a left-moving car: at time t1, the car occupies [h, tau] (with h <= tau, meaning from h to tau, so h is the left end and tau the right end? But wait: if the car is moving left, then the head (front) should be at the left, so h is the left end? Then the tail is the right end? Then the span is [h, tau] with h <= tau. Then at time T, the car is at [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)].\n\n- For a right-moving car: at time t1, the car occupies [tau, h] (with tau <= h, meaning from tau to h, so tau is the left end and h is the right end). Then at time T, the car is at [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)].\n\nBut wait: the problem says for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" and then becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So if tau <= h, then the interval is [tau, h] and then moves to the right.\n\nSo the key point: for a car, the span is the closed interval [min, max] of the x-coordinates it occupies.\n\nNow, the collision condition: at turn T, if the player is on freeway k (so y_T = k, which is between 1 and 8) and there is a car on that freeway k at turn T such that 0 is in the car's span at T, then collision.\n\nNote: the player is only on one freeway per turn. And at turn T, we are at y_T. We are only concerned with cars on that same freeway k = y_T.\n\nOur starting turn is t1 = 38, and we are at y=1. We need to reach y=9. The minimal H is the minimal number of turns to go from y=1 to y=9? The minimal number of moves would be 8 moves of \"U\", but we might have to wait because of collisions.\n\nBut note: we can also move down? But we start at 1 and need to get to 9, so down would be counterproductive. However, sometimes we might have to move down to avoid a collision? But let's see: we are at y=1 at turn 38. We can only move to y=0,1,2. Then we must eventually go up.\n\nBut the goal is to minimize the total turns H. So we want to go as fast as possible.\n\nLet me list the freeways and the cars at turn 38 (current turn). Then we need to compute for each freeway and for each turn T (>=38) the set of x such that the car spans include x? Actually, we only care about x=0.\n\nSo for each car on each freeway, we can compute the times T (>=38) at which 0 is in its span.\n\nWe note that the cars on the same freeway are independent. So for a freeway k, the freeway is dangerous at turn T if any of the cars on k at turn T has 0 in its span.\n\nGiven the car state:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (48, 83, left, 36) -> left-moving: at t1=38, span = [48, 83] (so from 48 to 83). Then at time T (>=38), the span is [48 - 36*(T-38), 83 - 36*(T-38)].\n\nWe want to know when 0 is in [48 - 36*(T-38), 83 - 36*(T-38)].\n\nSet: 48 - 36*(T-38) <= 0 <= 83 - 36*(T-38)\n\nSolve:\n\nFirst inequality: 48 - 36*(T-38) <= 0  => 36*(T-38) >= 48 => T-38 >= 48/36 = 4/3 => T-38 >= 2 (since T is integer, so T>=38+2=40)\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 83 - 36*(T-38) => 36*(T-38) <= 83 => T-38 <= 83/36 ≈ 2.305 => T-38 <= 2 => T<=40.\n\nSo the only T that satisfies both is T=40? Let me check:\n\nAt T=40: \n  span = [48 - 36*2, 83 - 36*2] = [48-72, 83-72] = [-24, 11]. Then 0 is in [-24,11] -> yes.\n\nAt T=39: \n  span = [48 - 36*1, 83 - 36*1] = [12,47]. 0 is not in [12,47].\nAt T=41: \n  span = [48 - 36*3, 83 - 36*3] = [48-108, 83-108] = [-60,-25]. 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 1 is dangerous only at T=40.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: (48,83,left,36) -> so same: dangerous only at T=40.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: \n  car1: (-24,-35,right,12) -> right-moving: at t1=38, span=[-35, -24] (because [tau, h] = [-35, -24]? But the problem says: (head, tail, direction, speed) = (-24, -35, right, 12). For right-moving, the initial span is [tail, head]? Actually, the problem says: for right-moving, the initial span is [tau, h]. So tau is the tail, h is the head. So at t1: [tau, h] = [-35, -24]. Then at T: [ -35 + 12*(T-38), -24 + 12*(T-38) ].\n\nWe want 0 in [ -35 + 12*(T-38), -24 + 12*(T-38) ]\n\nSo: -35 + 12*(T-38) <= 0 <= -24 + 12*(T-38)\n\nFirst: -35 + 12*(T-38) <= 0 => 12*(T-38) <= 35 => T-38 <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916 => T-38 <= 2 => T<=40\n\nSecond: 0 <= -24 + 12*(T-38) => 12*(T-38) >= 24 => T-38 >= 2 => T>=40\n\nSo T=40.\n\nCheck T=40: [ -35+12*2, -24+12*2] = [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0]. 0 is in [-11,0] -> yes.\n\nBut note: the interval is [left, right] and 0 is the right endpoint? So included.\n\nNow the other cars on freeway 3:\n\ncar2: (60,49,right,12) -> wait, head=60, tail=49? But for right-moving, we have [tau, head] = [49,60]. Then at T: [49+12*(T-38), 60+12*(T-38)]\n\nWe want 0 in [49+12*(T-38), 60+12*(T-38)]. But since T>=38, the smallest value is at T=38: [49,60] which is positive. And increasing. So never includes 0.\n\ncar3: (24,13,right,12) -> [13,24] at t1, then [13+12*(T-38), 24+12*(T-38)]. Always positive and increasing. Never includes 0.\n\nSo freeway 3: only dangerous at T=40 (because of the first car).\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3? The table says: same three cars. So same: dangerous only at T=40.\n\nFreeway 5: same as 3 and 4: dangerous only at T=40.\n\nFreeway 6: (-42,-53,right,6) -> wait, head=-42, tail=-53? Then for right-moving: [tail, head] = [-53, -42]. Then at T: [-53+6*(T-38), -42+6*(T-38)]\n\nWe want 0 in this interval:\n\n-53+6*(T-38) <= 0 <= -42+6*(T-38)\n\nFirst: -53+6*(T-38) <=0 => 6*(T-38) <=53 => T-38 <= 53/6 ≈ 8.833 -> T<=46\n\nSecond: 0<=-42+6*(T-38) => 6*(T-38)>=42 => T-38>=7 => T>=45\n\nSo T in [45,46]? Let me check:\n\nT=45: [-53+6*7, -42+6*7] = [-53+42, -42+42] = [-11,0] -> 0 is included? The interval is [-11,0] so 0 is the right endpoint -> included.\n\nT=46: [-53+6*8, -42+6*8] = [-53+48, -42+48] = [-5,6] -> 0 is in [-5,6] -> yes.\n\nT=44: [-53+6*6, -42+6*6] = [-53+36, -42+36] = [-17,-6] -> 0 not in.\n\nT=47: [-53+6*9, -42+6*9] = [-53+54, -42+54] = [1,12] -> no.\n\nSo freeway 6 is dangerous at T=45 and T=46.\n\nFreeway 7: same car: (-42,-53,right,6) -> same as freeway 6: dangerous at T=45,46.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars:\n  car1: (-42,-53,right,6) -> same as above: dangerous at T=45,46.\n  car2: (24,13,right,6) -> [13,24] at t1, then [13+6*(T-38),24+6*(T-38)] -> always positive and increasing? So never includes 0.\n\nSo freeway 8: dangerous at T=45 and 46.\n\nSummary of dangerous turns for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: T=40\nFreeway 2: T=40\nFreeway 3: T=40\nFreeway 4: T=40\nFreeway 5: T=40\nFreeway 6: T=45,46\nFreeway 7: T=45,46\nFreeway 8: T=45,46\n\nNote: freeways 0 and 9 are safe because there are no cars (the freeways with cars are 1 to 8, and the player is only at risk when on freeways 1-8).\n\nWe start at turn 38 at y=1.\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway k at a dangerous turn T for that freeway.\n\nSo:\n\n- At freeway 1: avoid at T=40\n- At freeway 2: avoid at T=40\n- ...\n- At freeway 5: avoid at T=40\n- At freeway 6: avoid at T=45,46\n- At freeway 7: avoid at T=45,46\n- At freeway 8: avoid at T=45,46\n\nWe are starting at y=1 (freeway 1) at turn 38. We are safe at turn 38? Because the dangerous turn for freeway 1 is only 40. So at turn 38, we are at y=1 and it's safe? But we must check: at turn 38, the car on freeway 1: span = [48,83] -> doesn't include 0. So safe.\n\nWe want to get to y=9. We can move up, down, or stay. Since we want to minimize H, we prefer moving up.\n\nBut we must avoid being on freeways 1 to 5 at turn 40 (because all of them are dangerous at T=40). Similarly, avoid freeways 6,7,8 at T=45 and 46.\n\nWe start at turn 38 at y=1.\n\nPlan:\n\nWe are at turn 38: at y=1 -> safe.\n\nTurn 39: we choose an action. We can go to y=0,1, or 2.\n\nBut note: at turn 39, we are at y=1? Actually, at the beginning of turn 38 we are at y=1. We choose an action at turn 38 that will set y_{39}. So during turn 38 we are at y=1, and then at the end of turn 38 we move to y_{39}.\n\nSo the position during the turn T is y_T. Therefore, at turn 39, we will be at y_{39} (which we set at turn 38).\n\nWe must avoid being at a freeway at a dangerous turn.\n\nDangerous turns:\n\n- For freeways 1-5: only at T=40\n- For freeways 6-8: at T=45,46\n\nWe must avoid being at any freeway 1-5 at turn 40. Similarly, avoid freeways 6-8 at turns 45 and 46.\n\nAlso, we must avoid being at any freeway at any turn if it is dangerous? But the dangerous turns are only the ones above? Actually, we have computed only for the given cars. And there are no other cars.\n\nSo the only dangerous situations are:\n\n- Being on freeway 1,2,3,4,5 at turn 40.\n- Being on freeway 6,7,8 at turn 45 or 46.\n\nWe can be on freeway 1 at turn 38 and 39? Because the dangerous turn for freeway 1 is only 40.\n\nSimilarly, we can be on freeway 1 at turn 41? But we have computed that the car on freeway 1 is only dangerous at 40.\n\nSo at turn 38: we are at y=1 -> safe.\nAt turn 39: if we stay at y=1, then we are at freeway 1 at turn 39 -> safe (because dangerous only at 40).\n\nBut then at turn 40, we must not be on freeways 1-5. So we must be at y=0 or y>=6? Or y=9? But y=0 is safe? Because it's not a freeway (freeways are 1-8). Similarly, y=9 is the goal and not a freeway.\n\nThe player can be at y=0 or y=9 without collision because there are no cars on those rows.\n\nSo at turn 40, we must be at y=0 or y>=6 (i.e., 6,7,8,9) to avoid freeways 1-5.\n\nSimilarly, at turns 45 and 46, we must avoid freeways 6,7,8. So we must be at y<=5 or y=9? But note: if we are at y=9, we are done. Or at y=0? Or at freeways 1-5? But at freeways 1-5, we are safe at turn 45 and 46? Because the dangerous turns for freeways 1-5 are only 40.\n\nSo:\n\n- At turn 40: we must be at y=0 or y>=6 (i.e., 6,7,8,9)\n- At turn 45: we must not be on freeways 6,7,8 -> so at y=0,1,2,3,4,5,9\n- At turn 46: same as turn 45.\n\nWe start at turn 38: y=1.\n\nWe want to get to y=9 as quickly as possible.\n\nMinimal moves: 8 moves up. But we have constraints at turn 40 and turns 45,46.\n\nWe are at turn 38: y=1.\n\nWe have 2 turns (turn38 and turn39) to prepare for turn40.\n\nAt turn40, we must be at y=0 or y>=6.\n\nIf we go up twice: \n  turn38: U -> y=2 at turn39\n  turn39: U -> y=3 at turn40 -> but 3 is in [1,5] -> not allowed at turn40.\n\nIf we go up and then down: \n  turn38: U -> y=2 at turn39\n  turn39: D -> y=1 at turn40 -> not allowed.\n\nIf we go down: \n  turn38: D -> y=0 at turn39 -> then at turn39 we are at y=0 (safe). Then turn39: we can choose to stay? Then at turn40 we are at y=0 -> safe. Then from y=0, we need to get to y=9: that will take 9 moves? But we can also go up.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to jump above y=5 by turn40? How? We start at y=1 at turn38. We can move up at turn38: to y=2 at turn39. Then at turn39, we must get to at least y=6? But we can only move up by 1 per turn. So at turn39, we can go to y=3 at turn40? Not enough.\n\nSo the only way to be at y>=6 at turn40 is if we are already at y>=5 at turn39 and then move up? But at turn38 we are at y=1. After turn38: we are at y=2 at turn39. Then at turn39, we can only get to y=3 by moving up. So we cannot reach y=6 by turn40.\n\nTherefore, the only safe option at turn40 is to be at y=0.\n\nSo we must be at y=0 at turn40.\n\nHow to get to y=0 at turn40?\n\nWe start at y=1 at turn38.\n\nWe can do:\n  turn38: D -> y=0 at turn39\n  turn39: S -> y=0 at turn40 (stay) -> then at turn40 we are at y=0 -> safe.\n\nAlternatively, we could do:\n  turn38: S -> y=1 at turn39\n  turn39: D -> y=0 at turn40 -> same result.\n\nBut we want to minimize the total turns? So we should not waste moves. However, we have to avoid the collision.\n\nNow, after turn40, we are at y=0. We need to get to y=9. That requires 9 moves up. But we also have to avoid the dangerous turns 45 and 46 for freeways 6,7,8.\n\nWe are at turn40: y=0.\n\nWe have to move up. We can start moving up.\n\nBut we must avoid being on freeways 6,7,8 at turns 45 and 46.\n\nSo we must plan the moves so that at turn45 and turn46 we are not on freeways 6,7,8 (i.e., not at y=6,7,8).\n\nWe are at turn40: y=0.\n\nWe need to go to y=9. The minimal number of moves is 9 moves up (if we do U every turn, we get to y=9 at turn49: \n  turn40: start at y0=0\n  turn40: U -> y41=1\n  turn41: U -> y42=2\n  turn42: U -> y43=3\n  turn43: U -> y44=4\n  turn44: U -> y45=5\n  turn45: U -> y46=6\n  turn46: U -> y47=7\n  turn47: U -> y48=8\n  turn48: U -> y49=9\n\nBut at turn45, we are at y45=5 -> safe (freeway 5? but freeway 5 is only dangerous at turn40, so safe). \nAt turn46, we are at y46=6 -> but freeway6 is dangerous at turn46 -> collision.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=6 at turn46.\n\nWe must avoid being at y=6,7,8 at turn45 and turn46.\n\nIn the above, at turn45: y=5 (safe) but at turn46: y=6 (dangerous).\n\nSo we need to adjust.\n\nWe can slow down: at some point, we can stay for one turn to avoid being at y=6,7,8 at turn45 and 46.\n\nWe want to be at a safe y at turn45 and turn46. Safe y at those turns: y<=5 or y=9.\n\nBut we are going up, so we can be at y<=5 at turn45, but then at turn46 we will be at y=6 if we move up? So we must not move up at turn45? Then we stay at y=5 at turn45 and then at turn46 we are still at y=5 (if we do S at turn45). Then at turn46, we are at y=5 -> safe. Then we can move up.\n\nBut then we are behind. We are at y=5 at turn46, then we need to go to y=9: that takes 4 more moves: \n  turn46: U -> y=6 at turn47\n  turn47: U -> y=7 at turn48\n  turn48: U -> y=8 at turn49\n  turn49: U -> y=9 at turn50.\n\nBut we started at turn40 at y=0. Then we did:\n  turn40: U -> y=1\n  turn41: U -> y=2\n  turn42: U -> y=3\n  turn43: U -> y=4\n  turn44: U -> y=5\n  turn45: S -> y=5 (stay)\n  turn46: U -> y=6\n  turn47: U -> y=7\n  turn48: U -> y=8\n  turn49: U -> y=9\n\nSo we reach at turn49? But at turn49, we are at y=9? Actually, at the end of turn49, we are at y=9. Then the turn that we complete is turn49. So H is the number of turns from t1=38 to the turn we reach y=9. We started at turn38: we are at y=1. Then we have:\n\nTurn38: action -> leads to y at turn39\n...\nWe need to count the total turns from turn38 to the turn when we are at y=9.\n\nAlternatively, we can think: we are at turn38 (t1) and we are at y=1. We do actions for H turns, and at the end of the last action (at turn t1+H-1) we are at y=9.\n\nIn the above plan:\n\nWe have:\n\nAt turn38: we do D -> to y=0 at turn39\nAt turn39: we do S -> to y=0 at turn40\n\nThen at turn40: we start going up.\n\nBut we have to count the entire sequence.\n\nTotal sequence:\n\nTurn38: D -> y39=0\nTurn39: S -> y40=0   (now we are at turn40, safe at y=0)\n\nThen from turn40 to turn49: 9 turns? But we have 10 actions from turn40 to turn49? Actually, the actions are at turn40, turn41, ..., turn49? Then the player reaches y=9 at turn50? Let me clarify:\n\nAt the beginning of turn40: we are at y40=0 (set by the action at turn39).\nAt turn40: we choose an action. If we choose U, then at the end of turn40, we set y41=1.\n\nSo the turn when we are at y=9: \n  After the action at turn49: we set y50=9? \n\nBut we need the last turn index to be t1 + H - 1 = 38 + H - 1.\n\nWe are at turn38: we do an action that sets y39.\nAt turn39: we do an action that sets y40.\n...\nAt turn T: we do an action that sets y_{T+1}.\n\nWe are at y=9 when y_{T} = 9 for some T.\n\nBut note: we start at turn38: y38=1 (given). Then after our first action at turn38, we set y39.\n\nSo we are at y=9 at the end of some turn? Actually, we are at position y_t at the beginning of turn t? But the problem says: at turn T, the player is at y_T. And we choose action a_T to set y_{T+1}.\n\nSo we are at y_{t1} = y38 = 1.\n\nWe do actions a38, a39, ..., a_{38+H-1} to set y39, y40, ..., y_{38+H}.\n\nWe want y_{38+H} = 9.\n\nSo H is the number of actions. Then the last action is at turn 38+H-1, and it sets y_{38+H}=9.\n\nSo the total turns we simulate: from turn38 to turn38+H-1.\n\nIn the first part:\n\nWe need to get to y40=0. How?\n\nOption1:\n  turn38: D -> y39 = 0\n  turn39: S -> y40 = 0\n\nThen we have used 2 actions: H_so_far=2, and we are at y40=0.\n\nNow from turn40: we want to get to y_{?}=9.\n\nWe plan:\n\n  turn40: U -> y41=1\n  turn41: U -> y42=2\n  turn42: U -> y43=3\n  turn43: U -> y44=4\n  turn44: U -> y45=5\n  turn45: S -> y46=5   (because we stay: so we avoid being at freeway6 at turn46? Actually, we are at y=5 at turn45 and turn46: safe? But note: at turn45: we are at y45=5 (freeway5? but freeway5 is only dangerous at turn40, so safe). At turn46: y46=5 -> safe.\n  turn46: U -> y47=6\n  turn47: U -> y48=7\n  turn48: U -> y49=8\n  turn49: U -> y50=9\n\nSo we have from turn40 to turn49: 10 actions? But we do actions at turn40,41,...,49: that's 10 actions? Then y50=9.\n\nBut we want y_{38+H}=9. So 38+H = 50 => H=12.\n\nThe actions: we have 12 actions: from turn38 to turn49.\n\nList:\n\nturn38: D\nturn39: S\nturn40: U\nturn41: U\nturn42: U\nturn43: U\nturn44: U\nturn45: S\nturn46: U\nturn47: U\nturn48: U\nturn49: U\n\nThen at the end of turn49, we set y50=9 -> so we are at y=9 at turn50? But the problem: we are at y_t at the beginning of turn t. So at the beginning of turn50, we are at y50=9 -> that is the goal.\n\nBut the last action is at turn49. So H=12 turns: from turn38 to turn49 (inclusive) -> 12 actions.\n\nBut we started at turn38: we were at y38=1. Then after the sequence, we are at y50=9.\n\nBut is there a faster way?\n\nAlternative: instead of going down to 0, can we go up to a safe freeway above 5 by turn40? But we saw that we cannot because we can only get to y=3 at turn40.\n\nBut what if we move up at turn38 to y=2, then at turn39 we move up to y=3, then at turn40 we are at y=3 -> which is freeway3 and dangerous at turn40. So not allowed.\n\nSo the only safe option is to go down to 0.\n\nBut note: we could also go to y=0 at turn40 by:\n\n  turn38: S -> y39=1\n  turn39: D -> y40=0\n\nSame as above.\n\nNow, after being at y=0 at turn40, we can try to optimize the upward movement to avoid the freeway6-8 at turns45,46 without having to wait at y=5.\n\nWe have from turn40 to turn45: 5 turns (turn40,41,42,43,44) to move up. We start at y40=0. We can move up 5 times: then at turn45 we are at y45=5.\n\nThen at turn45, we must not move up to y=6? Because at turn46 we would be at y46=6 (if we move at turn45) -> dangerous. So we have to stay at turn45: then at turn46 we are at y46=5. Then we move up at turn46 to y=6 at turn47, etc.\n\nSo we cannot avoid the stay at turn45.\n\nBut we could slow down earlier? For example, if we move only 4 times in the first 5 turns? Then we are at y44=4. Then at turn44: we move up to y45=5. Then at turn45: we stay -> y46=5. Then at turn46: move up to y47=6, etc. Then we reach y50=9 as above. Same total.\n\nAlternatively, if we move faster? But we can only move one per turn.\n\nBut we have to avoid being at y=6,7,8 at turn45 and 46. So we must not be at those positions at those turns.\n\nWe can be at y=9 at turn45? Then we are safe. But can we get to y=9 by turn45?\n\nWe start at turn40: y=0. Then we have 5 actions (turn40 to turn44) to get to y=9. That requires 9 moves? So we can only get to y=5 at turn45? Because:\n\n  turn40: U ->1\n  turn41: U->2\n  turn42: U->3\n  turn43: U->4\n  turn44: U->5  -> so at turn45 we are at y45=5.\n\nThen we cannot be at y=9 until later.\n\nSo we have to wait at turn45 to avoid being at freeway6 at turn46.\n\nBut is there a way to be at y=9 earlier? We started at turn38 at y=1. We used two turns to get to y=0 at turn40. Then 5 turns to get to y=5 at turn45. Then we have to wait at turn45 (so we don't move to y=6 at turn46) and then move up from turn46 to turn49 to get to y=9 at turn50.\n\nTotal H=12.\n\nBut we might consider going up earlier? For example, can we be at a higher y at turn40? We cannot.\n\nWhat if we don't go down to 0? We have to be at y=0 or y>=6 at turn40. Since we cannot reach y>=6, we must be at y=0.\n\nBut what about being at y=9? Then we are done. But we are at y=1 at turn38, and we need 8 moves to get to 9. Then we would be at turn46? \n\nBut let's check: \n  turn38: U -> y39=2\n  turn39: U -> y40=3 -> but at turn40, we are at y40=3 -> freeway3 -> dangerous at turn40? Yes. So we cannot.\n\nSo we must avoid freeways1-5 at turn40.\n\nTherefore, the plan we have is minimal? But let's check if we can avoid the stay at turn45 by being at a safe y at turn45 and 46 without waiting.\n\nWe must be at y<=5 or y=9 at turn45 and 46.\n\nWe are at turn40: y=0. We have 5 moves to turn44 to get to y at turn45.\n\nWe can get to y=5 at turn45 by moving up 5 times.\n\nBut then at turn46, we are at y=5 (if we don't move at turn45) or y=6 (if we move at turn45). If we move at turn45, we get y46=6 -> dangerous. So we must not move at turn45: so we stay at y=5 at turn46? Then we are safe at turn46.\n\nBut then we are at y=5 at turn46. Then we need to go to y=9: that takes 4 moves: \n  turn46: U -> y47=6\n  turn47: U -> y48=7\n  turn48: U -> y49=8\n  turn49: U -> y50=9\n\nSo we reach at turn50.\n\nWe cannot get to y=9 earlier because we are forced to wait at turn45.\n\nBut what if we move slower in the beginning? For example, we do only 4 moves in the first 4 turns (turn40 to turn43) to get to y44=4? Then at turn44: we move up to y45=5. Then at turn45: we can either move up (to y46=6) or stay (to y46=5). If we move up, then at turn46 we are at y46=6 -> dangerous. So we must stay at turn45: then we are at y46=5. Then we move up at turn46 to y47=6, etc. and we still reach y50=9. Same as above.\n\nIf we do 5 moves: same.\n\nSo we cannot avoid the delay at turn45.\n\nBut note: we have to also consider that we might be able to be at y=9 at turn45? But we start at turn40 at y=0: we need 9 moves to get to 9. But we have only 5 actions from turn40 to turn44 (which set y41 to y45). So we can only get to y45=5.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 12.\n\nBut let me see if we can be at y=0 at turn40 and then move up without the stay, but still avoid the collision? How? We have to avoid being at freeway6 at turn46. So if we are at y=5 at turn45, we must not move to y=6 at turn45? Because then at turn46 we are at y=6. So we have to stay at turn45.\n\nAlternatively, we can be at y=9 at turn46? Then we are safe. But to be at y=9 at turn46: we start at turn40: y=0. Then we have 6 moves: turn40 to turn45 (6 actions) to set y41 to y46. Then we can get to y46=6? Not 9. We can only get to y46=6. So we cannot.\n\nTherefore, the plan is fixed.\n\nBut wait: is there a way to skip the freeways 6-8 at turns45,46 by being at a safe y? We can only be at y<=5 or y=9. Since we cannot be at y=9, we must be at y<=5 at turn45 and turn46.\n\nBut at turn45, we are at y=5 (if we moved up 5 times). Then at turn46, we are at y=5 (if we stay at turn45). Then we avoid.\n\nSo the sequence we have is:\n\nturn38: D  -> to y39=0\nturn39: S  -> to y40=0\nturn40: U  -> to y41=1\nturn41: U  -> to y42=2\nturn42: U  -> to y43=3\nturn43: U  -> to y44=4\nturn44: U  -> to y45=5\nturn45: S  -> to y46=5  (stay to avoid being at freeway6 at turn46)\nturn46: U  -> to y47=6\nturn47: U  -> to y48=7\nturn48: U  -> to y49=8\nturn49: U  -> to y50=9\n\nTotal actions: from turn38 to turn49: 12 actions.\n\nBut the goal is reached at turn50? And we set y50=9 at the end of turn49. So at the beginning of turn50, we are at y=9. So we are done.\n\nBut the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\" and we are at (0,9) at turn50. The last action is at turn49.\n\nSo the sequence of actions: 12 actions.\n\nBut is there a way to do it in 11? \n\nSuppose we don't go down to 0? But we must be safe at turn40. We have to be at y=0 or y>=6. We cannot get to y>=6. So we must be at y=0.\n\nWhat if we go down at turn38 to y=0 at turn39? Then at turn39, we are at y=0. Then we can start moving up at turn39: but then at turn40 we set y41? \n\nWait: at turn39: we are at y39=0. Then we choose an action at turn39: if we choose U, then at the end of turn39 we set y40=1. But then at turn40, we are at y40=1? -> which is freeway1 and dangerous at turn40. So not allowed.\n\nTherefore, we must set y40=0. So at turn39, we must choose an action that leaves y40=0: either stay (if we are at y=0) or move down (but we are at y=0, so down is not allowed? Actually, the movement: if we are at y=0 and choose D, then we stay at 0? The problem says: y_{t+1} = y_t + delta, and y_{t+1} in [0,9]. So if at y=0 and choose D, then y_{t+1}= max(0, 0-1)=0.\n\nSo we can do:\n\nturn38: D -> y39=0\nturn39: D or S -> y40=0\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo we cannot avoid using two turns to get to y=0 at turn40.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 12.\n\nNow, we must output the actions from turn38 to turn49.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning t from 0 to H-1. So for t=0: a_{t1} = a38, t=1: a39, ..., t=11: a49.\n\nSo the answer:\n\nTurn 38: D\nTurn 39: S\nTurn 40: U\nTurn 41: U\nTurn 42: U\nTurn 43: U\nTurn 44: U\nTurn 45: S\nTurn 46: U\nTurn 47: U\nTurn 48: U\nTurn 49: U\n\nBut let me double-check the dangerous turns:\n\nAt turn40: we are at y40=0 -> safe.\n\nAt turn45: we are at y45=5 -> freeway5? but freeway5 is only dangerous at turn40 -> safe.\n\nAt turn46: we are at y46=5 -> same.\n\nThen at turn47: we are at y47=6 -> freeway6. Is freeway6 dangerous at turn47? We computed freeway6 dangerous at T=45,46. So turn47 is safe? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, turn48: y48=7 -> freeway7: dangerous at 45,46? So safe at 48.\n\nTurn49: y49=8 -> freeway8: dangerous only at 45,46? So safe.\n\nAnd we reach y50=9.\n\nBut note: at turn49, we are at y49=8 (freeway8) and we move up to y50=9. Then at turn49, we are at y49=8: is that safe? Yes, because freeway8 is only dangerous at 45,46.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nBut we could have moved up at turn45? Then we would be at y46=6 at turn46 -> and freeway6 is dangerous at turn46 -> collision.\n\nSo we must stay at turn45.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is correct.\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\". We have H=12. Is there a way with H=11?\n\nSuppose we try to avoid the initial two moves? But we have to be at y=0 at turn40. We start at y=1 at turn38. We can only get to y=0 at turn39 by moving down at turn38. Then at turn39, if we move up, then at turn40 we are at y40=1 -> collision. So we must not move up at turn39.\n\nAlternatively, we could be at y=0 at turn40 by moving down at turn39: but that requires being at y=1 at turn39. So:\n\n  turn38: S -> y39=1\n  turn39: D -> y40=0\n\nSame as before: two moves.\n\nSo no.\n\nAlternatively, can we be at y=9 at turn40? That would require 8 moves from turn38 to turn39? But we only have two moves: we can only get to y=3.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nTherefore, H=12 is minimal.\n\nSo the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 38: D\nTurn 39: S\nTurn 40: U\nTurn 41: U\nTurn 42: U\nTurn 43: U\nTurn 44: U\nTurn 45: S\nTurn 46: U\nTurn 47: U\nTurn 48: U\nTurn 49: U\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and we have H=12, so t from 0 to 11.\n\nWe have 12 actions: t=0 (turn38) to t=11 (turn49).\n\nYes.\n\nSo this should be the minimal sequence.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 1) at turn \\(t_1 = 38\\) in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\). Collisions occur if the player is on a freeway \\(y\\) at turn \\(T\\) and a car on that freeway has a span that includes \\(x = 0\\) at turn \\(T\\).\n\n### Analysis of Dangerous Turns\n- Freeways 1 to 5 are dangerous only at turn 40.\n- Freeways 6 to 8 are dangerous at turns 45 and 46.\n- At turn 40, the player must be at \\(y = 0\\) or \\(y \\geq 6\\) to avoid freeways 1-5. However, starting from \\(y = 1\\) at turn 38, it is impossible to reach \\(y \\geq 6\\) by turn 40 due to movement constraints (only one unit per turn). Thus, the only safe option at turn 40 is \\(y = 0\\).\n- At turns 45 and 46, the player must avoid freeways 6-8, meaning they must be at \\(y \\leq 5\\) or \\(y = 9\\).\n\n### Path Planning\n1. **Turns 38 to 40 (Reach \\(y = 0\\) safely):**\n   - At turn 38, the player is at \\(y = 1\\). Moving down (D) sets \\(y_{39} = 0\\).\n   - At turn 39, staying (S) sets \\(y_{40} = 0\\), which is safe (not a freeway and avoids collision at turn 40).\n\n2. **Turns 40 to 44 (Ascend to \\(y = 5\\)):**\n   - From turn 40, the player is at \\(y = 0\\). Moving up (U) each turn for 5 turns (turns 40 to 44) sets \\(y_{45} = 5\\).\n\n3. **Turn 45 (Avoid freeways 6-8 at turn 46):**\n   - At turn 45, the player is at \\(y = 5\\). Staying (S) sets \\(y_{46} = 5\\), which is safe (freeway 5 is only dangerous at turn 40, and \\(y = 5 \\leq 5\\) avoids freeways 6-8).\n\n4. **Turns 46 to 49 (Reach \\(y = 9\\)):**\n   - From turn 46, moving up (U) each turn for 4 turns (turns 46 to 49) sets \\(y_{50} = 9\\).\n\n### Minimal Turns\n- The sequence requires 12 actions (turns 38 to 49) to reach \\(y_{50} = 9\\).\n- This is minimal because:\n  - Reaching \\(y = 0\\) by turn 40 requires at least 2 turns (from \\(y = 1\\) at turn 38).\n  - Reaching \\(y = 9\\) from \\(y = 0\\) requires at least 9 moves, but the collision at turn 46 forces a stay at turn 45, adding one extra turn. Thus, 11 turns are insufficient.\n\n### Action Sequence\nThe sequence of actions for turns 38 to 49 is:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 38: \\text{D} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 39: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 40: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 41: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 42: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 43: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 44: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 45: \\text{S} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 46: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 47: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 48: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 49: \\text{U}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,0) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 39, and I start at y=0. I need to find a sequence of actions: U (up), D (down), or S (stay) for each turn until I reach y=9.\n\nFirst, understand the car movements. Cars move left or right with constant speed. For left-moving cars, the span at time T is [h - s(T - t_1), τ - s(T - t_1)], and for right-moving, it's [τ + s(T - t_1), h + s(T - t_1)]. Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway y_T at that turn and 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway. Importantly, when I move to a new y, I'm not on that freeway until the next turn. So at turn T, I'm on y_T, and I choose an action to go to y_{T+1}, but I'm only on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe position at turn T is (0, y_T), and after action a_T, I go to y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy, which is effective at turn T+1.\n\nCollision at turn T depends on y_T and the car spans at time T for that freeway.\n\nNow, the goal is to reach y=9 as quickly as possible. Since I start at y=0 and need to go to y=9, and I can only move up or down by 1 each turn or stay, the minimum number of turns without any obstacles would be 9 moves up, so H=9 turns. But with cars, I might need to wait or go down sometimes to avoid collisions, so H could be more.\n\nBut let's see if I can do it in 9 turns.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn T, meaning that at turn T-1, I was at y=8 and moved up, or at y=9 and stayed, but since I start from 0, I need to move up step by step.\n\nActually, to reach y=9, I need to have y_{t_1 + H} = 9, but the sequence is for t from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, and after H actions, I should be at y=9.\n\nLet's clarify the timing.\n\nAt turn t, position is y_t.\n\nAfter action a_t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo after H actions, from t_1 to t_1 + H - 1, I have y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nI want y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nThe minimal H such that I can reach y=9 in H steps.\n\nStarting from y_{t_1} = 0 at turn t_1.\n\nAfter 0 actions, y_{t_1} = 0.\n\nAfter 1 action (t=t_1), y_{t_1+1} = ?\n\nAfter H actions, y_{t_1 + H} = 9.\n\nSo I need to go from y=0 to y=9, which requires at least 9 up moves, but I can have stays or down moves, so H >=9.\n\nMinimal H is at least 9.\n\nNow, I need to check for each step from y to y+1, if I can move without colliding on the freeways.\n\nBut I need to be on each freeway y at some turn, and at that turn, no car should have 0 in their span.\n\nAlso, since cars are moving, the spans change over time, so I need to consider when I am on each row.\n\nFirst, let's list the cars for each freeway.\n\nFreeways y=1 to 8.\n\nFrom the table:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head h=12, tail τ=47, direction left, speed s=36)\n\nBut direction left, so moving left. Head and tail: for left-moving, head is the leading part? Let's see the span.\n\nFor left-moving car: span at t_1 is [h, τ] = [12,47], but since moving left, at time T, span is [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving.\n\nIn the car state, for left-moving, head and tail: I think head is the front, tail is the back.\n\nIn the update, for left-moving: span(t_1) = [h, τ] → at T, [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nBut [h, τ] with h=12, τ=47, so if moving left, the car is from x=12 to x=47, and moving left, so left end is at h=12, right end at τ=47? That seems odd because usually we think left end smaller x, but here h=12, τ=47, so τ > h, so it's from lower x to higher x? But moving left.\n\nPerhaps the coordinates are such that decreasing x is left.\n\nAssume x-axis horizontal, y vertical.\n\nFreeway y=k has cars moving horizontally.\n\nFor a car on freeway i, at time t, span is the set of x positions it occupies.\n\nCollision if player at (0,y_t) and 0 in span for that freeway at time t.\n\nNow for freeway 1: car with (h=12, τ=47, d=left, s=36)\n\nd=left, so moving left. At t_1=39, span is [h, τ] = [12,47]. Since moving left, at time T, the span is [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)] = [12 - 36(T-39), 47 - 36(T-39)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, (12,47,left,36)\n\nFreeway 3: multiple cars: (-12,-23,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12), (36,25,right,12)\n\nd=right, so for right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h]? Let's see the notation.\n\nIn the car update: for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → at T, [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the problem: for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nFor the first car on freeway 3: τ=-12, h=-23? That can't be, because if τ and h, and [τ,h], but τ=-12, h=-23, so -12 > -23, so [τ,h] with τ > h, which is decreasing, but for right-moving, it should be increasing.\n\nI think there might be a confusion in notation.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nFor right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nAnd in the car state, for freeway 3: (-12,-23,right,12), so I think τ is given first, then h.\n\nIn the list: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor each car, it's (h, τ, d, s)\n\nFor the first car on freeway 3: h=-12, τ=-23, d=right, s=12\n\nFor right-moving, span at t_1 is [τ, h] = [-23, -12] because τ=-23, h=-12? No.\n\nThe notation: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, ...)\"\n\nThen for right-moving, \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h]\" so with τ and h as given.\n\nFor this car, h=-12, τ=-23, so [τ, h] = [-23, -12]\n\nThen at time T, [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [-23 + 12(T-39), -12 + 12(T-39)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nLet's clarify the head and tail.\n\nIn the span, for right-moving, [τ, h] with τ and h such that the car occupies from τ to h, with τ < h for right-moving, I assume.\n\nIn this case, for first car: h=-12, τ=-23, so τ = -23, h = -12, so τ < h, so [τ, h] = [-23, -12], which makes sense, from x=-23 to x=-12.\n\nMoving right, so at T, [ -23 + 12(T-39), -12 + 12(T-39) ]\n\nSimilarly, second car on freeway 3: (-48,-59,right,12), so h=-48, τ=-59, so τ=-59, h=-48, so τ < h? -59 < -48, yes, so [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nAt T, [-59 + 12(T-39), -48 + 12(T-39)]\n\nThird car on freeway 3: (36,25,right,12), so h=36, τ=25, so τ=25, h=36, so τ < h, [25,36]\n\nAt T, [25 + 12(T-39), 36 + 12(T-39)]\n\nFreeway 4 same as freeway 3: three cars with same parameters.\n\nFreeway 5 same.\n\nFreeway 6: one car (-36,-47,right,6), so h=-36, τ=-47, τ=-47, h=-36, [τ,h] = [-47,-36]\n\nAt T, [-47 + 6(T-39), -36 + 6(T-39)]\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway 6, one car (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: (-36,-47,right,6) and (30,19,right,6)\n\nFirst car: (-36,-47,right,6) same as above, [τ,h] = [-47,-36] at t_1\n\nSecond car: (30,19,right,6), h=30, τ=19, so τ=19, h=30, [19,30] at t_1\n\nAt T, for first: [-47 +6(T-39), -36 +6(T-39)]\n\nSecond: [19 +6(T-39), 30 +6(T-39)]\n\nNow, t_1 = 39.\n\nI need to find when I can be on each y from 1 to 8 without 0 in the car span for that y at that turn.\n\ny=0 and y=9 have no cars, so no issue there.\n\nAt turn t_1=39, I am at y=0. I can choose to go to y=1 or stay or down, but down to y=-1 not possible, y in [0,9], so y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, and clamped to 0 or 9 if out of range, but since I start at 0, if I go down, I stay at 0.\n\nSimilarly at 9, if I go up, stay at 9.\n\nBut here, from 0, I can only go up or stay.\n\nSimilarly to reach 9, I need to be at 8 or 9 and move up or stay.\n\nBut let's focus on the path.\n\nThe player position y_t must be integer between 0 and 9.\n\nTo go from 0 to 9, I need to pass through each y from 1 to 8 at some point, but not necessarily in order, since I can go up and down.\n\nTo minimize turns, I probably want to go up as much as possible, but may need to avoid cars by waiting or moving down temporarily.\n\nSince I can stay or move down, I can delay or go back to avoid collisions.\n\nBut for minimal H, I should avoid unnecessary moves, so ideally go up directly if possible.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, the times when 0 is not in any car span, so it is safe to be on that row.\n\nFor a given freeway k, at time T, it is safe if for all cars on that freeway, 0 is not in their span at T.\n\nThen I can be on y=k at turn T without collision.\n\nNow, since I move step by step, I need to plan the sequence.\n\nFirst, let's find the unsafe times for each row.\n\nStart with freeway 1: y=1, one car (12,47,left,36)\n\nAt time T, span: [12 - 36(T-39), 47 - 36(T-39)]\n\n0 in span if 12 - 36(T-39) <= 0 <= 47 - 36(T-39)\n\nSince the car is moving left, the span is shifting left.\n\nSet u = T - 39, so time offset.\n\nSpan: [12 - 36u, 47 - 36u]\n\n0 in [12-36u, 47-36u] if 12-36u <= 0 and 0 <= 47-36u\n\nSince 12-36u <=0 implies u >= 12/36 = 1/3\n\nAnd 0 <= 47-36u implies u <= 47/36 ≈ 1.3056\n\nSo for u in [1/3, 47/36], approximately [0.333, 1.3056]\n\nSince u must be integer (turns), T integer, u integer.\n\nu = T - 39, integer.\n\nu=1: 12-36= -24, 47-36=11, so [-24,11], 0 in [-24,11] yes.\n\nu=0: T=39, [12,47], 0 not in [12,47], since 12>0.\n\nu=0: 12-0=12, 47-0=47, [12,47], 0 not <=12? 12>0, so 0 not in [12,47], safe.\n\nu=1: 12-36= -24, 47-36=11, [-24,11], 0 in this, yes, unsafe.\n\nu=2: 12-72= -60, 47-72= -25, [-60,-25], 0 not in, safe.\n\nu=1.305, but u integer, so u=0: safe, u=1: unsafe, u=2: safe.\n\nu=0: T=39, safe\n\nu=1: T=40, unsafe\n\nu=2: T=41, safe\n\nFor T<39 or T>41, let's see.\n\nu=-1: T=38, 12 -36(-1) =12+36=48, 47+36=83, [48,83], 0 not in, safe.\n\nu=3: 12-108= -96, 47-108= -61, [-96,-61], 0 not in, safe.\n\nSo for freeway 1, unsafe only at u=1, i.e., T=40.\n\nAt T=39,40,41,... but only T=40 unsafe.\n\nT=39: safe, T=40: unsafe, T=41: safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 is identical to freeway 1, so same: unsafe only at T=40.\n\nNow freeway 3: y=3, three cars.\n\nFirst car: (-12,-23,right,12) but this is for right-moving, with h and τ.\n\nCar: (h=-12, τ=-23, d=right, s=12)\n\nFor right-moving, span at T: [τ + s(T-39), h + s(T-39)] = [-23 +12u, -12 +12u] where u=T-39\n\n0 in span if -23 +12u <= 0 <= -12 +12u\n\nSo -23 +12u <=0 and 0 <= -12 +12u\n\nFirst inequality: -23 +12u <=0 => 12u <=23 => u <= 23/12 ≈1.9167\n\nSecond: 0 <= -12 +12u => 12u >=12 => u >=1\n\nSo u in [1, 23/12] ≈ [1, 1.9167], so for integer u, u=1 and u=2? u=1: 1<= u <=1.916, so u=1.\n\nu=1: T=40\n\nAt u=1: span [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0]\n\n0 <=0, and -11<=0, so 0 in [-11,0], yes.\n\nu=2: -23+24=1, -12+24=12, [1,12], 0 not in [1,12], since 0<1.\n\nu=1: [ -23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], 0 is included, since <=0 and >= -11.\n\nSimilarly, u=1.916: -23+23=0? 12*1.916≈23, -23+23=0, -12+23=11, [0,11], 0 included.\n\nBut u integer, so only u=1: T=40\n\nNow second car on freeway 3: (-48,-59,right,12) h=-48, τ=-59\n\nSpan at T: [τ +12u, h +12u] = [-59 +12u, -48 +12u]\n\n0 in span if -59+12u <=0 <= -48+12u\n\nSo -59+12u <=0 => 12u <=59 => u <= 59/12 ≈4.9167\n\nAnd 0 <= -48+12u => 12u >=48 => u >=4\n\nSo u in [4, 59/12] ≈ [4, 4.9167], so u=4 and u=5? u=4,5\n\nu=4: -59+48= -11, -48+48=0, [-11,0], 0 in\n\nu=5: -59+60=1, -48+60=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo for this car, unsafe at u=4, T=39+4=43\n\nT=43\n\nu=4: T=39+4=43\n\nThird car on freeway 3: (36,25,right,12) h=36, τ=25\n\nSpan at T: [τ +12u, h +12u] = [25+12u, 36+12u]\n\n0 in span if 25+12u <=0 <=36+12u\n\nBut 25+12u <=0? 12u <= -25, u <= -25/12 ≈ -2.083, impossible since u>=0\n\nAnd 0 <=36+12u always true for u>=0.\n\nBut 25+12u <=0 only for u negative, not possible. So 0 never in span for this car.\n\nSimilarly, min is at u=0, [25,36], 25>0, so 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 3, unsafe when first car has 0 in span at u=1 (T=40), or second car at u=4 (T=43)\n\nFirst car unsafe at T=40, second at T=43.\n\nThird car always safe.\n\nSo freeway 3 unsafe at T=40 and T=43.\n\nNow freeway 4 same as freeway 3, since same cars, so unsafe at T=40 and T=43.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5 same.\n\nNow freeway 6: y=6, one car (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nh=-36, τ=-47\n\nSpan at T: [τ +6u, h +6u] = [-47 +6u, -36 +6u]\n\n0 in span if -47+6u <=0 <= -36+6u\n\nSo -47+6u <=0 => 6u <=47 => u <= 47/6 ≈7.833\n\nAnd 0 <= -36+6u => 6u >=36 => u >=6\n\nSo u in [6, 47/6] ≈ [6, 7.833], so u=6,7\n\nu=6: -47+36= -11, -36+36=0, [-11,0], 0 in\n\nu=7: -47+42= -5, -36+42=6, [-5,6], 0 in? -5 <=0<=6, yes 0 in [-5,6]\n\nu=7: -47+42= -5, -36+42=6, [-5,6], 0 in.\n\nu=8: -47+48=1, -36+48=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nu=6: T=39+6=45, span [-11,0]\n\nu=7: T=46, span [-5,6], 0 in\n\nu=8: T=47, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nAnd u=5: -47+30= -17, -36+30= -6, [-17,-6], 0 not in\n\nSo unsafe at u=6 and u=7, T=45 and 46.\n\nSimilarly freeway 7 same as 6, unsafe at T=45,46.\n\nNow freeway 8: y=8, two cars.\n\nFirst car: (-36,-47,right,6) same as above, so unsafe when? For this car alone, same as freeway 6, unsafe at u=6,7 T=45,46.\n\nBut there is another car.\n\nSecond car: (30,19,right,6) h=30, τ=19\n\nSpan at T: [τ +6u, h +6u] = [19+6u, 30+6u]\n\n0 in span if 19+6u <=0 <=30+6u\n\n19+6u <=0 => 6u <= -19, impossible for u>=0\n\n0 <=30+6u always true.\n\nMin at u=0, [19,30], 19>0, so 0 never in span. Safe.\n\nSo for freeway 8, only the first car matters, unsafe at T=45 and 46, same as freeway 6 and 7.\n\nFirst car on freeway 8 is (-36,-47,right,6), same as on 6 and 7, so yes.\n\nNow summarize for each freeway, the unsafe times:\n\ny=1: unsafe at T=40\n\ny=2: unsafe at T=40 (same as y=1)\n\ny=3: unsafe at T=40 and T=43\n\ny=4: same as y=3, unsafe at T=40 and 43\n\ny=5: same, unsafe at T=40 and 43\n\ny=6: unsafe at T=45 and 46\n\ny=7: unsafe at T=45 and 46\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=45 and 46\n\nAnd at other times, safe.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=0 at T=39 to y=9.\n\nAt T=39, I am at y=0.\n\nI can take actions to change y.\n\nI need to be at y=9 at some turn after.\n\nSince y=9 has no cars, I can be there any time, but I need to reach it.\n\nThe minimal H: I need to move up 9 times, so if no delays, H=9, arrive at T=39+9=48, y=9.\n\nBut with cars, I need to avoid being on unsafe rows at unsafe times.\n\nSo let's see the path.\n\nI start at T=39, y=0.\n\nI want to move to y=1, but at T=39, y=1 is safe? Freeway y=1 is safe at T=39, as we saw earlier.\n\nAt T=39, for y=1, we have u=0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can be on y=1 at T=39.\n\nBut at T=39, I am at y=0, so to be on y=1 at T=40, I need to move up at T=39.\n\nLet's think carefully.\n\nAt turn T, I am at position y_T.\n\nI choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nCollision is at turn T, based on y_T and the cars at T.\n\nSo for example, at T=39, I am at y=0, which has no cars, so no collision, safe.\n\nThen I choose a_{39}, which sets y_{40}.\n\nThen at T=40, I am at y_{40}, and check collision based on y_{40} and cars at T=40.\n\nSimilarly for each turn.\n\nI need to ensure that for each turn T, when I am at y_T, if y_T between 1 and 8, it is not unsafe at that T.\n\ny_T=0 or 9 are always safe.\n\nNow, unsafe times:\n\nFor y=1: unsafe only at T=40\n\nSimilarly y=2: unsafe at T=40\n\ny=3: unsafe at T=40 and T=43\n\netc.\n\nI start at T=39, y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some T.\n\nMinimal steps: I must go up 9 times, so the earliest I can be at y=9 is T=48, if I move up every turn from 39 to 47.\n\ny_{39} = 0\n\na_{39} = U: y_{40} =1\n\na_{40} = U: y_{41} =2\n\n...\n\nup to a_{47} = U: y_{48} =9\n\nNow, check for each turn from T=39 to T=47, the position y_T and if collision.\n\nT=39: y=0, safe.\n\nT=40: y_{40} =1, and y=1 is unsafe at T=40, so collision! Not good.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=1 at T=40.\n\nSimilarly, if I were on y=2 at T=40, also unsafe.\n\nBut in this path, at T=40, y=1, unsafe.\n\nSo I need to avoid being on row 1 or 2 at T=40, since both unsafe at T=40.\n\ny=1 and y=2 both unsafe at T=40.\n\nAlso, if I am on y=3 at T=40, unsafe too.\n\ny=3 unsafe at T=40.\n\nSo at T=40, I cannot be on y=1,2,3 because all unsafe.\n\nWhat about y=4? y=4 unsafe at T=40 and T=43, so at T=40 unsafe.\n\ny=5 same.\n\ny=6: unsafe at T=45,46, but at T=40, y=6 is safe, since only unsafe at 45,46.\n\nSimilarly y=7,8 safe at T=40.\n\ny=0 and y=9 always safe.\n\nSo at T=40, safe rows are y=0,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut I am starting from y=0 at T=39.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 quickly, I should go up, but I need to be not on low rows at T=40.\n\nOne option: at T=39, I stay or move up.\n\nIf I move up to y=1 at T=40, but T=40 y=1 unsafe.\n\nIf I stay, at T=40, I am at y=0, which is safe.\n\nThen from there, I can move later.\n\nBut staying at y=0 delays.\n\nSimilarly, I could move to higher rows faster, but I can only move one step per turn.\n\nAnother idea: at T=39, since y=0 safe, I stay, so at T=40, y=0, safe.\n\nThen at T=40, I can move up to y=1, but at T=40, y=1 is unsafe, so if I move up to y=1 at T=40, y_{41}=1, but collision at T=40 is based on y_T, not y_{T+1}.\n\nAt T=40, if I am at y_{40}, which could be 0 if I stayed, or 1 if I moved up from below.\n\nIn this case, at T=39, y=0.\n\nIf a_{39} = S, then y_{40} =0\n\nThen at T=40, y=0, safe.\n\nThen a_{40} = U, then y_{41} =1\n\nNow, at T=41, y=1, need to check if safe.\n\nFor y=1, unsafe only at T=40, so at T=41, safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can continue up.\n\nBut let's list the sequence.\n\nStart T=39, y=0.\n\nOption 1: Stay at T=39: a_{39} = S, then y_{40} =0\n\nAt T=40, y=0, safe.\n\nThen a_{40} = U, y_{41} =1\n\nT=41, y=1, safe (since unsafe only T=40)\n\nThen a_{41} = U, y_{42} =2\n\nT=42, y=2, now y=2 unsafe only at T=40, so at T=42 safe.\n\nThen a_{42} = U, y_{43} =3\n\nT=43, y=3, but y=3 unsafe at T=43! Because we have T=43 unsafe for y=3.\n\nAt T=43, y=3, unsafe.\n\nProblem.\n\nSo if I go directly, at T=43 I am at y=3, which is unsafe.\n\nSimilarly, if I arrive later.\n\nI need to avoid being on y=3 at T=43.\n\nSimilarly, y=4 and y=5 also unsafe at T=43.\n\ny=3,4,5 all unsafe at T=43.\n\nAt T=43, safe rows: y=0,1,2,6,7,8,9? y=1 safe except T=40, so at T=43 safe. y=2 safe except T=40. y=6 safe except T=45,46, so at T=43 safe.\n\nSo at T=43, unsafe only for y=3,4,5.\n\nSafe: y=0,1,2,6,7,8,9.\n\nNow back to the path.\n\nFrom T=39, y=0.\n\nIf I stay at T=39, y_{40}=0\n\nThen at T=40, I can move up to y=1, but y=1 at T=41? Action at T=40: if a_{40}=U, y_{41}=1\n\nThen at T=41, y=1, safe.\n\nThen a_{41}=U, y_{42}=2\n\nT=42, y=2, safe.\n\nThen at T=42, I need to go to y=3 or something.\n\nIf a_{42}=U, y_{43}=3, but T=43 y=3 unsafe.\n\nIf I stay at y=2, a_{42}=S, y_{43}=2, then at T=43, y=2, which is safe.\n\nThen later I can move to y=3.\n\nBut y=3 has another unsafe time? Only T=40 and T=43, so after T=43, y=3 is safe.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nSo to avoid T=43 on y=3, I can delay.\n\nBut I also have later unsafe times for higher rows.\n\nFirst, let's list all unsafe times:\n\nSummary:\n\n- T=40: unsafe for y=1,2,3,4,5 (since y=1,2,3,4,5 all unsafe at T=40? y=1 and 2 unsafe only T=40, y=3,4,5 unsafe at T=40 and T=43.\n\nAt T=40, y=1,2,3,4,5 are all unsafe, because y=1,2 directly, y=3,4,5 at T=40 also unsafe.\n\ny=1: unsafe T=40\n\ny=2: unsafe T=40\n\ny=3: unsafe T=40 and T=43\n\nSimilarly y=4 and y=5.\n\nSo at T=40, unsafe for y=1,2,3,4,5.\n\nSafe: y=0,6,7,8,9\n\nAt T=43, unsafe for y=3,4,5\n\nSafe: y=0,1,2,6,7,8,9\n\nAlso, T=45 and T=46, unsafe for y=6,7,8\n\nAt T=45 and 46, y=6,7,8 unsafe.\n\nSafe at other times.\n\nNow, to reach y=9 quickly.\n\nI need to go through the rows.\n\nSince at T=40, I cannot be on y=1-5, I should be on y=0 or y=6+.\n\nBut I start at y=0, and at T=40, I can be at y=0 if I stay.\n\nFrom y=0, to reach y=6, I need at least 6 up moves, but I have only one turn from T=39 to T=40.\n\nAt T=39, y=0.\n\nAfter one action, y_{40} can be 0 or 1.\n\nCannot be 6 immediately.\n\nSo at T=40, the only safe y are 0,6,7,8,9, but I can only be at y=0 or y=1 at T=40, since from y=0, I go to 0 or 1.\n\nSo possible y at T=40: 0 or 1.\n\nBut y=1 unsafe at T=40, so only possible safe is y=0 at T=40.\n\nThus, at T=39, I must stay: a_{39} = S, so y_{40} =0.\n\nThen at T=40, y=0, safe.\n\nNow from here, I need to go up.\n\nAt T=40, I am at y=0.\n\nI can choose a_{40}: U to y=1, or S to y=0.\n\nIf I go to y=1, at T=41, y=1.\n\nBut y=1 is safe at T=41, as only unsafe at T=40.\n\nSimilarly, I can go up to y=2 at T=42, safe.\n\nThen at T=42, y=2.\n\nNow, I need to go to y=3, but at T=43, y=3 is unsafe.\n\nSo if I go to y=3 at T=43, unsafe.\n\nI can stay at y=2 for one turn.\n\nSo at T=42, if I do S, then y_{43} =2.\n\nThen at T=43, y=2, which is safe (since y=2 unsafe only at T=40).\n\nThen after that, I can go to y=3.\n\nAt T=43, y=2, safe.\n\nThen a_{43} = U, y_{44} =3\n\nNow T=44, y=3, is it safe? y=3 unsafe at T=40 and T=43, not at T=44, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, I can continue up.\n\nBut I have to deal with higher rows later.\n\nNow from y=3 at T=44, I can go up.\n\na_{44} = U, y_{45} =4\n\nT=45, y=4, but y=4 unsafe at T=43? T=43 is past, now T=45.\n\ny=4 unsafe at T=40 and T=43, not at T=45, so should be safe? But y=4 is freeway 4, which has unsafe at T=40 and T=43 only, so at T=45 safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=5 same.\n\nBut at T=45, y=6,7,8 are unsafe.\n\nIn this case, at T=45, I am at y=4, which is safe.\n\nThen I can continue.\n\nBut let's see when I reach y=6.\n\nCurrently, at T=44, y=3.\n\na_{44} = U, y_{45} =4\n\nT=45, y=4, safe (since T=45 not unsafe for y=4)\n\na_{45} = U, y_{46} =5\n\nT=46, y=5, safe (y=5 unsafe only T=40,43)\n\na_{46} = U, y_{47} =6\n\nNow T=47, y=6, but y=6 unsafe at T=45 and T=46, not at T=47? T=47 is after, so should be safe.\n\ny=6 unsafe at T=45 and 46, so at T=47 safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nThen a_{47} = U, y_{48} =7\n\nT=48, y=7, unsafe? y=7 unsafe at T=45 and 46, not at T=48, so safe.\n\na_{48} = U, y_{49} =8\n\nT=49, y=8, unsafe at T=45,46? y=8 unsafe at T=45 and 46, T=49 safe.\n\na_{49} = U, y_{50} =9\n\nReached y=9 at T=50.\n\nBut H is the number of actions from t_1 to t_1+H-1.\n\nt_1=39.\n\nActions from t=39 to t=39+H-1, then y_{39+H} =9.\n\nIn this sequence:\n\nT=39: y=0, a=S, y40=0\n\nT=40: y=0, a=U, y41=1\n\nT=41: y=1, a=U, y42=2\n\nT=42: y=2, a=S, y43=2  (stayed to avoid T=43 at y=3)\n\nT=43: y=2, a=U, y44=3\n\nT=44: y=3, a=U, y45=4\n\nT=45: y=4, a=U, y46=5\n\nT=46: y=5, a=U, y47=6\n\nT=47: y=6, a=U, y48=7\n\nT=48: y=7, a=U, y49=8\n\nT=49: y=8, a=U, y50=9\n\nSo y50=9, with actions from t=39 to t=49, that is 11 actions? Let's list the actions:\n\nAction at t=39: S\n\nt=40: U\n\nt=41: U\n\nt=42: S\n\nt=43: U\n\nt=44: U\n\nt=45: U\n\nt=46: U\n\nt=47: U\n\nt=48: U\n\nt=49: U\n\nThen y50=9.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=39 to t=49 inclusive, that's 11 actions.\n\nBut t from 39 to 49, that's 11 turns? Actions at 11 times.\n\nStart at T=39, after 0 actions, y39.\n\nAfter 1 action (at t=39), y40\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, y_{39+k}\n\nSet y_{39+H} =9, so H=11 in this case.\n\nBut is this minimal? H=11.\n\nEarlier I thought min 9, but with delays.\n\nI had to stay at T=39 and at T=42, so two extra stays, so 11 turns.\n\nBut perhaps I can avoid one stay.\n\nFor example, at T=40, I am at y=0, safe.\n\nInstead of going up slowly, maybe I can go to higher rows faster, but I can't, only one step.\n\nAnother idea: since at T=40, safe to be on y=6,7,8, but I can't reach there from y=0 at T=40.\n\nUnless I was already there, but I start at y=0.\n\nPerhaps I can go down, but from y=0, I can't go down.\n\nSo no.\n\nMaybe later I can skip some rows or something, but I have to go through each.\n\nAnother point: at T=43, if I can be on a safe row.\n\nIn the above, I was at y=2 at T=43, safe.\n\nIf I were at y=6 at T=43, it is safe, but I can't reach y=6 by T=43 from T=40 y=0.\n\nT=40 y=0, to y=6, I need at least 6 up moves, so earliest y=6 at T=46, since from T=40 to T=41 y=1, T=42 y=2, ..., T=46 y=6.\n\nT=46 y=6, but at T=46, y=6 is unsafe! Because y=6 unsafe at T=45 and 46.\n\nSimilarly, I need to avoid T=45 and 46 on y=6,7,8.\n\nIn my sequence, I reached y=6 at T=47, which is safe, and T=47 is after T=46.\n\nNow, back to T=43.\n\nIn my sequence, I used a stay at T=42 to avoid being on y=3 at T=43.\n\nBut perhaps I can be on another row at T=43.\n\nFor example, if I can be on y=6 at T=43, but impossible from T=40 y=0.\n\nT=40 y=0, T=41 y=1, T=42 y=2, T=43 y=3 at best, so I must be on y=0,1,2,3 at T=43.\n\nAt T=43, unsafe for y=3,4,5, so safe for y=0,1,2,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut I can be on y=0,1,2 at T=43.\n\nIn my sequence, I am on y=2 at T=43, safe.\n\nIf I were on y=1, also safe, or y=0.\n\nBut y=1 or 2 at T=43 is fine.\n\nNo need to be on y=3 at T=43.\n\nSo my sequence seems ok.\n\nBut I have another stay at T=39.\n\nAt T=39, I had to stay because if I moved up, I would be on y=1 at T=40, unsafe.\n\nBut is there a way to not stay at T=39?\n\nFor example, if I could be on a high row at T=40, but I can't.\n\nPerhaps I can move down later, but not necessary.\n\nSo minimal H might be 11.\n\nBut let's see if I can reduce.\n\nSuppose at T=39, I stay, y40=0.\n\nThen at T=40, instead of going up, I stay again? But that delays more.\n\nNot good.\n\nAt T=40, I go up to y=1, which at T=41 is safe.\n\nThen to avoid T=43 on y=3, I can, after y=2, go down or something, but going down would make me take more steps.\n\nFor example:\n\nT=39: y=0, a=S, y40=0\n\nT=40: y=0, a=U, y41=1\n\nT=41: y=1, a=U, y42=2\n\nNow at T=42, y=2.\n\nInstead of staying, I go down? a=D, but y42=2, a=D, y43=1\n\nThen at T=43, y=1, which is safe.\n\nThen I need to go back up.\n\na_{43} = U, y44=2\n\nThen a_{44} = U, y45=3\n\nT=45, y=3, safe? y=3 unsafe at T=40 and T=43, not T=45, so safe.\n\nThen continue as before.\n\nBut now I have extra down and up, so more turns.\n\nWorse.\n\nFrom y=2 at T=42, I go up to y=3 at T=43, but unsafe, so not possible.\n\nSo staying is better.\n\nNow, about the higher rows.\n\nIn my sequence, I reached y=6 at T=47, which is safe, and went up to 7,8,9.\n\nBut at T=45 and 46, I was on y=4 and 5, which are safe at that time.\n\ny=4 and 5 unsafe only at T=40 and 43, so at T=45 and 46 safe.\n\nNo problem.\n\nBut I have two stays: at t=39 and t=42.\n\nCan I avoid one?\n\nFor example, at t=39, if I could be at a position where I don't need to stay, but I can't.\n\nSuppose I move up immediately but skip the unsafe row at T=40 by being elsewhere, but I can't.\n\nAnother idea: since at T=40, I can be at y=0, which is safe, and then I go up fast, but still I have to deal with T=43.\n\nAt T=43, if I can be on y=6 or something.\n\nBut from T=40 y=0, to T=43 y=6, I need 6 steps in 3 turns, impossible, only 3 steps to y=3 at T=43.\n\nSo I must be on y=3 or less at T=43.\n\nSince y=3,4,5 unsafe at T=43, I need to be on y=0,1,2 at T=43.\n\nIn the sequence, I am on y=2 at T=43.\n\nCould I be on y=1 or 0, but that might require going down, which takes more turns.\n\nFor example, if at T=42 I go down to y=1 at T=43, then I need to go back up.\n\nMore turns.\n\nSo being on y=2 at T=43 is efficient.\n\nNow, about the end: I reached y=9 at T=50.\n\nBut let's see the unsafe times for y=6,7,8 at T=45,46.\n\nIn my sequence, I am at y=6 at T=47, after the unsafe period.\n\nBut could I be at y=6 earlier?\n\nFor example, if I go up faster.\n\nFrom T=40 y=0:\n\nT=40: U, y41=1\n\nT=41: U, y42=2\n\nT=42: U, y43=3 but unsafe at T=43, cannot.\n\nIf I go up to y=2 at T=42, then I have to stay or something, but at T=43 I can be on y=2 or y=3, but y=3 unsafe.\n\nSo I stay at y=2 at T=42 to T=43.\n\nThen at T=43, U to y=3 at T=44? T=43 action: a_{43}=U, y_{44}=3\n\nSame as before.\n\nTo reach y=6 faster, I need to be at higher y earlier, but I can't because of the delays.\n\nSuppose at some point I move up multiple times without delay, but I have to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nAnother thought: at T=45 and 46, y=6,7,8 unsafe, but y=5 is safe, and y=9 safe.\n\nBut I need to pass through.\n\nIn my sequence, when I am at y=5 at T=46, which is safe, then at T=46 I go to y=6, but at T=47 y=6, safe.\n\nBut at T=46, I am at y=5, which is fine.\n\nCould I be at y=8 or 9 at T=45 or 46?\n\nBut from start, I can't reach that early.\n\nEarliest y=9 at T=48, but at T=48, if I were there, but to reach T=48 y=9, I need to start from T=39 y=0, with 9 up moves, but at T=40 I would be at y=1, unsafe.\n\nNot possible.\n\nSo minimal H is 11 as in my sequence.\n\nBut let's confirm the actions.\n\nt_1=39.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 39: S\n\nThen y40=0\n\nTurn 40: U\n\ny41=1\n\nTurn 41: U\n\ny42=2\n\nTurn 42: S  (stay to avoid moving to y=3 at T=43)\n\ny43=2\n\nTurn 43: U\n\ny44=3\n\nTurn 44: U\n\ny45=4\n\nTurn 45: U\n\ny46=5\n\nTurn 46: U\n\ny47=6\n\nTurn 47: U\n\ny48=7\n\nTurn 48: U\n\ny49=8\n\nTurn 49: U\n\ny50=9\n\nNow, H=11 actions, from t=39 to t=49.\n\nBut y_{39+11} = y_{50} =9.\n\nNumber of turns from start: at turn t_1=39, after 0 actions, position.\n\nAfter first action at t_1, position at t_1+1.\n\n...\n\nAfter H actions, position at t_1 + H.\n\nSet t_1 + H = 50, so H=11.\n\nBut is there a shorter way?\n\nSuppose I don't stay at t=39, but I can't because of T=40.\n\nPerhaps I can go to y=3 after T=43.\n\nBut I have to go through.\n\nAnother idea: at T=42, instead of staying, I go up to y=3 at T=43, but unsafe, not possible.\n\nOr, I could be on y=4 or 5 at T=43, but same unsafe, and I can't reach y=4 by T=43 from below.\n\nT=40 y=0, T=41 y=1, T=42 y=2, T=43 y=3 max.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, the sequence seems necessary.\n\nBut let's check if at T=45 and 46, I can be on safe rows.\n\nIn the sequence, at T=45, I am at y=4, which is safe.\n\nT=46, y=5, safe.\n\nT=47, y=6, safe, etc.\n\nNow, about freeway 8, but I am on y=8 at T=49, which is after T=46, safe.\n\nPerhaps I can reach y=9 faster by not staying at some point, but I don't think so.\n\nSuppose I stay less.\n\nFor example, at T=39, I must stay, as established.\n\nAt T=42, I stay to avoid y=3 at T=43.\n\nBut at T=43, I could be on y=2, which I am.\n\nIf I go to y=3 at T=44, as I did.\n\nNo way around.\n\nThus, minimal H=11.\n\nBut let's list the actions for the answer.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t_1=39 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nH=11, so actions from t=39 to t=39+10=49? t from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1=39, H=11, so t from 39 to 39+10=49.\n\nActions at t=39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49.\n\nAs above.\n\nNow, in the output, it should be:\n\nTurn 39: S\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: S\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: U\n\nTurn 45: U\n\nTurn 46: U\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nThen y50=9.\n\nIn the sequence, at turn 49, action U from y=8 to y=9.\n\nNow, but in the car states, for freeway 3,4,5, there was a car at (36,25,right,12) which I thought always safe, but let me confirm if at any point I am on those rows when unsafe.\n\nFor example, when I am on y=3 at T=44.\n\nFreeway 3 cars: at T=44, u=44-39=5\n\nFirst car: [-23 +12*5, -12 +12*5] = [-23+60, -12+60] = [37,48], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [-59+12*5, -48+12*5] = [-59+60, -48+60] = [1,12], 0 not in since 0<1? 0 not <=1, 1>0, so [1,12] min x=1>0, so 0 not in.\n\nThird car: [25+12*5, 36+12*5] = [25+60,36+60]=[85,96], no.\n\nSimilarly, other times fine.\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nNow, for y=6 at T=47, u=8\n\nFreeway 6 car: [-47 +6*8, -36 +6*8] = [-47+48, -36+48] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, all good.\n\nBut in the sequence, I have two S actions, but perhaps I can reduce by one if I can avoid one stay.\n\nFor example, at T=42, if I don't stay, but I must to avoid T=43 y=3.\n\nUnless I am not on y=3 at T=43, but I can't be elsewhere.\n\nPerhaps I can go directly to a higher row, but no.\n\nAnother thought: since at T=43, y=3,4,5 unsafe, but y=2 safe, and I can go from y=2 to y=6 directly? No, must go step by step.\n\nSo I think 11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's see the time to y=9.\n\nStarted at T=39 y=0, arrived T=50 y=9, 11 turns.\n\nPerhaps I can start moving later, but not helpful.\n\nSo I think this is the plan.\n\nNow, for the answer, I need to output the sequence.\n\nIn the car state, for freeway 8, there was a car (30,19,right,6), but I didn't use it since I was on y=8 late.\n\nBut in general, fine.\n\nNow, the actions:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} = a_{39} = S\n\nThen Turn t_1 +1: a_{40} = U\n\n...\n\nUp to Turn t_1 +10: a_{49} = U\n\nSince H=11, actions from t=0 to H-1 relative, but in terms of t.\n\nIn the answer format: Turn t_1: a_{t_1} etc.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 39: S\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: S\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: U\n\nTurn 45: U\n\nTurn 46: U\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nNow, to confirm, with these actions:\n\nAfter a39=S, y40=0\n\na40=U, y41=1\n\na41=U, y42=2\n\na42=S, y43=2\n\na43=U, y44=3\n\na44=U, y45=4\n\na45=U, y46=5\n\na46=U, y47=6\n\na47=U, y48=7\n\na48=U, y49=8\n\na49=U, y50=9\n\nAnd no collisions, as checked.\n\nIs there a sequence with H=10?\n\nSuppose H=10, then y_{39+10}=y_{49}=9.\n\nSo I need to be at y=9 at T=49.\n\nThen I must have been at y=8 at T=48, and moved up.\n\nOr at y=9 at T=48 and stayed, but starting from 0, I need to reach.\n\nTo be at y=9 at T=49, I need 9 up moves in 10 actions, so one stay or down, but down not useful.\n\nWith one stay.\n\nBut I need to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nFor example, at T=40, I must not be on y=1,2,3,4,5, so must be on y=0 or 6+, but only y=0 possible, so at T=40, y=0, which requires that at T=39, I stay, so a39=S.\n\nThen y40=0.\n\nThen to reach y=9 at T=49, I need from T=40 to T=49, 9 actions to go from y=0 to y=9, which requires all U, no stay.\n\nBut I have to avoid T=43 on y=3,4,5 and T=45,46 on y=6,7,8.\n\nWith all U from T=40:\n\na40=U, y41=1\n\na41=U, y42=2\n\na42=U, y43=3  // but T=43 y=3 unsafe! Collision.\n\nIf I have a stay somewhere, but with only 9 actions for 9 moves, I must have all U, no stay, so I would be at y=3 at T=43, unsafe.\n\nIf I stay at some point, I arrive later.\n\nFor example, if I stay at T=42, then y43=2, then a43=U, y44=3, then to y=9 at T=49, I need from y44=3 to y49=9, 5 up moves, but T=44 to T=49 is 5 turns, actions a44 to a48, y45 to y49.\n\na44=U, y45=4\n\na45=U, y46=5\n\na46=U, y47=6\n\na47=U, y48=7\n\na48=U, y49=8\n\nThen y49=8, not 9.\n\nTo y49=9, I need y49=9, so from y44=3, I need to go to 9 in 5 actions: 6 moves? From y44=3 to y49=9, that's 6 steps, but only 5 actions: a44,a45,a46,a47,a48 determine y45 to y49.\n\ny44=3, after a44, y45; ... after a48, y49.\n\nTo have y49=9, since y44=3, I need to increase by 6 in 5 actions, impossible, since each action at most +1.\n\nMax y49 = 3 + 5 = 8 with all U.\n\nSo cannot reach y=9 at T=49 with a stay at T=42.\n\nIf I stay earlier, worse.\n\nThus, impossible to reach before T=50.\n\nHence, minimal H=11.\n\nSo the sequence is as above.\n\nNow for the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 0)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 39\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by staying at \\(y = 0\\) during turn 39 to avoid the unsafe condition at turn 40 for \\(y = 1\\) and \\(y = 2\\), and staying at \\(y = 2\\) during turn 42 to avoid the unsafe condition at turn 43 for \\(y = 3\\), \\(y = 4\\), and \\(y = 5\\). The higher freeways \\(y = 6\\), \\(y = 7\\), and \\(y = 8\\) are avoided during their unsafe times (turns 45 and 46) by reaching them after turn 46.\n\nThe action sequence is as follows:\n\n- At turn 39, stay (\\(S\\)) to remain at \\(y = 0\\), avoiding being on \\(y = 1\\) or \\(y = 2\\) at turn 40.\n- At turn 40, move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 1\\), which is safe at turn 41.\n- At turn 41, move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 2\\), which is safe at turn 42.\n- At turn 42, stay (\\(S\\)) to remain at \\(y = 2\\), avoiding being on \\(y = 3\\) at turn 43.\n- At turn 43, move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 3\\), which is safe at turn 44.\n- At turn 44, move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 4\\), which is safe at turn 45.\n- At turn 45, move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 5\\), which is safe at turn 46.\n- At turn 46, move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 6\\), which is safe at turn 47 (after the unsafe period at turns 45 and 46).\n- At turn 47, move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 7\\), which is safe at turn 48.\n- At turn 48, move up (\\(U\\)) to \\(y = 8\\), which is safe at turn 49.\n- At turn 49, move up (\\(U\\)) to reach \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThis sequence ensures no collisions and reaches \\(y = 9\\) in 11 turns, with \\(y_{50} = 9\\).\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 39: \\, S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 40: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 41: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 42: \\, S \\\\ \\text{Turn } 43: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 44: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 45: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 46: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 47: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 48: \\, U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 49: \\, U \\\\ \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,0) at turn 40 to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nThe car positions are given for turn t1=40, and I need to find where they are at future turns to avoid collisions. Collision happens if at some turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car such that the player's x=0 is within the car's span at that turn.\n\nThe player update is straightforward: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t based on action.\n\nFor cars, the span changes linearly with time based on speed and direction. Left-moving cars decrease their position, right-moving increase.\n\nFor example, on freeway 1: one car, head -24, tail 11, direction left, speed 36. Since it's left-moving, the span is [h, τ] which is [-24, 11], and as time increases, the positions decrease. So at time T, span is [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] = [-24 - 36(T-40), 11 - 36(T-40)].\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut the collision condition: at turn T, if the player is on y_T, and for that freeway, there is a car where 0 is in the span at time T.\n\nAlso, important note: when you move to a new y, you are not on that freeway until the next turn. So if at turn T you are on y_T, and you move to y_{T+1} at turn T, you won't be considered on y_{T+1} until turn T+1. So if there's a collision on y_{T+1} at turn T, but you're not there yet, it's fine. You only care about the freeway you're currently on at each turn.\n\nThe collision occurs only if at turn T, y_T is the freeway you're on, and 0 is in the span of some car on that freeway at that exact turn.\n\nNow, since the player starts at y=0, which is not a freeway, so no collision possible at y=0. Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, I think. y=9 is the goal, so probably no cars there or it's safe.\n\nThe grid is vertical axis y=0 to 9, freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe zones with no cars.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,0), goal is (0,9).\n\nNow, I need to move up to y=9, passing through y=1 to 8, but avoiding times when cars are at x=0 on those lanes.\n\nEach action takes one turn, so time increases with each action.\n\nLet me denote t = 0 as the starting turn, but in the problem, it's t1=40, but since everything is relative, I can think of t=0 as turn 40 for simplicity, and then H turns from there.\n\nSet t=0 as the current turn, turn 40.\n\nSo at t=0, player at y=0.\n\nI need to reach y=9 at some turn T, so after H actions, at turn H, y_H =9, and T = t1 + H, but since t1=40, but for actions, we start from t=0 to H-1, so at time t (from start), after t actions, it's turn 40 + t.\n\nBut for car positions, I need time since t1.\n\nDefine time τ = t, where t=0 is turn 40.\n\nThen at time t, the turn is 40 + t.\n\nPlayer position: start y_0 = 0.\n\nAfter action a_t at time t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t based on a_t.\n\nAnd y_t must be in 0 to 9.\n\nNow, for cars, at time t (since start), the car positions are for turn 40 + t.\n\nFor each freeway, the car spans at time t.\n\nCollision at time t if y_t is between 1 and 8, and for freeway k = y_t, there is a car such that 0 is in the span at that time.\n\nNow, let's list all the freeways and their cars.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head h=-24, tail τ=11, dir left, speed s=36.\n\nSince left-moving, span at time t: [h - s t, τ - s t] = [-24 - 36t, 11 - 36t]\n\nBecause at t=0 (turn 40), it's [-24,11], and for each step, it moves left by s=36 per turn? Speed is per turn, I think.\n\nThe speed is given, and it's the change per turn, I believe.\n\nIn the update: for T > t1, span becomes [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)] for left-moving.\n\nSimilarly for right.\n\nSo yes, s is the speed per turn, so position changes by s per turn.\n\nSo for freeway 1 at time t: span = [-24 - 36t, 11 - 36t]\n\nNow, this is for the car; but the span is the positions it occupies, so if 0 is between min and max of the span.\n\nSince it's left-moving, and head is less than tail? No, in the notation, for left-moving, it says \"Span(t1) = [h, τ]\" and h=-24, τ=11, so h < τ? -24 < 11, yes, so the span is from h to τ, which is from left to right? But since it's moving left, positions decrease.\n\nIn terms of position, the car occupies from min to max position.\n\nIn this case, for left-moving, h is the head (left end?), τ is tail (right end?), so span is [h, τ] with h < τ, I assume, since it's a car with length.\n\nHere h=-24, τ=11, so min position -24, max 11 at t=0.\n\nAfter time t, min = h - s t = -24 -36t, max = τ - s t = 11 -36t.\n\nSimilarly for other cars.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: (-24,11,left,36), so identical to freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: (0, -11, right, 12), (-36, -47, right, 12), (48, 37, right, 12)\n\nDirection right.\n\nFor right-moving, it says: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" and then [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)]\n\nIn the problem: for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\"\n\nNow, what is τ and h here? In the car state, it says \"cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nFor right-moving, it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\", which might be confusing.\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\nFor car k on freeway i, at turn t1, head h, tail τ, direction d.\n\nThen for left-moving: span at t1 is [h, τ]\n\nFor right-moving: span at t1 is [τ, h]\n\nIn the freeway 3, first car: (0, -11, right, 12)\n\nSo head h=0, tail τ=-11, direction right.\n\nFor right-moving, span at t1 is [τ, h] = [-11, 0]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (-36, -47, right, 12), so h=-36, τ=-47? Tail τ=-47, head h=-36? But for right-moving, span should be [τ, h] = [-47, -36]\n\nAnd third car: (48, 37, right, 12), h=48, τ=37, span [τ, h] = [37, 48]\n\nAt time t, for right-moving, span is [τ + s t, h + s t]\n\nSo for freeway 3:\n\nCar 1: [τ + s t, h + s t] = [-11 + 12t, 0 + 12t] = [-11 + 12t, 12t]\n\nCar 2: [τ + s t, h + s t] = [-47 + 12t, -36 + 12t]\n\nCar 3: [37 + 12t, 48 + 12t]\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3: three cars identical.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (-30, -41, right, 6)\n\nh=-30, τ=-41, direction right.\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [-41, -30]\n\nAt time t: [τ + s t, h + s t] = [-41 + 6t, -30 + 6t]\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway 6: (-30, -41, right, 6)\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: (-30, -41, right, 6) and (36, 25, right, 6)\n\nFirst car: same as above, [-41 + 6t, -30 + 6t]\n\nSecond car: (36, 25, right, 6), h=36, τ=25, span at t1 [τ, h] = [25, 36]\n\nAt time t: [25 + 6t, 36 + 6t]\n\nNow, the player needs to go from y=0 to y=9. Since y=0 is safe, and y=9 is safe, but to reach y=9, when you move to y=9, you are at y=9 at the turn when you arrive, but since y=9 has no freeway or is safe, no issue.\n\nFreeways are only y=1 to 8, so y=9 should be fine.\n\nThe minimal H would be at least 9 if you always move up, but you might need to wait or detour to avoid cars.\n\nSince you can only change y by -1,0,+1, the minimal number of turns to go from 0 to 9 is 9, if you always go up. But you might need to go down or stay to avoid collisions, which could increase H.\n\nBut the goal is to minimize H, so we should aim for as few turns as possible, so ideally H=9 with all U actions, but we need to check if at each step, when on y=1 to 8, there is no car at x=0.\n\nSo let's simulate for H=9, all U: actions a_t = U for t=0 to 8, then at t=9, y=9.\n\nNow, at each time t, player position y_t = t, since start from y=0, and each U increases by 1.\n\nt from 0 to 9: at time t, y_t = t.\n\nNow, collision at time t if y_t between 1 and 8, and on freeway k=y_t, 0 is in some car span.\n\nSo for each t from 1 to 8, check if on freeway t, at time t, 0 is in a car span.\n\nTime t here is from start, so absolute turn is 40 + t.\n\nBut car positions depend on t, the time since start.\n\nSo for freeway k, at time t, check if 0 is in the span for that freeway.\n\nLet's do for each y from 1 to 8 at time t=y.\n\nt is the time index, y_t = t for this path.\n\nSo:\n\nAt t=1, y=1, freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 1 car: span at time t: [-24 -36t, 11 -36t]\n\nSet 0 in [min, max] i.e. min <= 0 <= max\n\n-24 -36t <= 0 <= 11 -36t\n\nFirst inequality: -24 -36t <= 0 => -36t <= 24 => t >= -24/36 = -2/3, which is true since t>=0.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 11 -36t => 36t <= 11 => t <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305\n\nSo for t <= 0.305, 0 is in span.\n\nt is integer, so at t=0, 0 <= 11 -0 =11, yes 0<=11 true.\n\nAt t=1, 0 <= 11-36= -25? 0 <= -25 false, so not in span.\n\nAt t=1, min = -24 -36(1) = -24-36= -60, max=11-36= -25, so span [-60,-25], 0 not in it.\n\nSimilarly, at t=0, span [-24,11], 0 is between -24 and 11, yes.\n\nBut at t=1, for freeway 1, span is [-60,-25], 0 not in it.\n\nNow for collision at t=1, y=1, freeway 1 at time t=1.\n\nSpan is [-24-36(1), 11-36(1)] = [-60,-25], 0 not in [-60,-25], so no collision at t=1.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 is same, so no issue.\n\nNow t=2, y=2, freeway 2.\n\nFreeway 2 same as freeway 1, span at t=2: [-24-72, 11-72] = [-96,-61], 0 not in, so no collision.\n\nSimilarly for t=3 to 8, y=t, freeway t, but freeways are fixed, not changing with time except for cars.\n\nFreeway k for each k.\n\nAt t=2, y=2, so freeway 2, which has same car as freeway 1, span at t=2: [-24-72,11-72]=[-96,-61], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, for higher t, it gets more negative, so never 0 again.\n\nNow t=3, y=3, freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 3 has three cars.\n\nAt time t, car 1: [-11 +12t, 12t]\n\nCar 2: [-47 +12t, -36 +12t]\n\nCar 3: [37+12t, 48+12t]\n\nCheck if 0 in any of these spans at time t.\n\nFor car 1: min = -11+12t, max=12t\n\n0 in if -11+12t <= 0 <= 12t\n\nWhich is -11+12t <=0 and 0<=12t\n\nFirst: -11+12t <=0 => 12t <=11 => t <= 11/12 ≈0.916\n\nSecond: 0<=12t always for t>=1? t>=0.\n\nBut t=3 here.\n\nAt t=3, min = -11+36=25, max=36, so [25,36], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly, car 2: min=-47+12t, max=-36+12t\n\nAt t=3, min=-47+36=-11, max=-36+36=0, so span [-11,0], so 0 is in it? max=0, min=-11, so 0 is included.\n\n-11 <= 0 <= 0, yes, 0 <= 0 true.\n\nSo at t=3, for car 2 on freeway 3, span is [-47+12*3, -36+12*3] = [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0], so 0 is in this span.\n\nTherefore, at time t=3, player at y=3, which is freeway 3, and 0 is in car 2 span, so collision!\n\nSo with all U, at t=3, collision on freeway 3.\n\nThus, cannot go directly up at t=3.\n\nNow, for other times.\n\nBut since we have collision at t=3 for y=3, we need to avoid that.\n\nIn this path, at t=3, y=3, collision.\n\nNow, for completeness, at t=4, y=4, freeway 4.\n\nFreeway 4 same as 3, cars identical.\n\nAt t=4, car 1: min=-11+48=37, max=48, [37,48], 0 not in\n\nCar 2: min=-47+48=1, max=-36+48=12, [1,12], 0 not in? min=1>0, so 0 not in [1,12]\n\nCar 3: min=37+48=85, max=48+48=96? s=12, t=4, min=37+48=85, max=48+48=96, [85,96], 0 not in.\n\nSo at t=4, no collision on freeway 4.\n\nSimilarly, t=5, y=5, freeway 5, same as above, at t=5:\n\nCar 1: min=-11+60=49, max=60, [49,60]\n\nCar 2: min=-47+60=13, max=-36+60=24, [13,24]\n\nCar 3: min=37+60=97, max=48+60=108, all >0, no 0.\n\nt=6, y=6, freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6: one car, (-30,-41,right,6), so at time t, span: [-41 +6t, -30 +6t]\n\nAt t=6, min=-41+36= -5, max=-30+36=6, so [-5,6], 0 is in it? -5<=0<=6, yes.\n\nSo collision at t=6, y=6.\n\nt=7, y=7, freeway 7: same as freeway 6, car [-41+6t, -30+6t]\n\nAt t=7, min=-41+42=1, max=-30+42=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nt=8, y=8, freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 has two cars.\n\nFirst car: same as above, [-41+6t, -30+6t]\n\nAt t=8, min=-41+48=7, max=-30+48=18, [7,18], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: (36,25,right,6), span at time t: [25+6t, 36+6t]\n\nAt t=8, min=25+48=73, max=36+48=84, [73,84], 0 not in.\n\nSo no collision at t=8.\n\nBut in all U path, collisions at t=3 (y=3) and t=6 (y=6).\n\nSo need to avoid those.\n\nTo minimize H, we should try to go up as fast as possible, but wait or move down to avoid the collision times.\n\nSince we can stay or move down, but moving down might increase H.\n\nH is the number of turns to reach y=9, so we want to reach as soon as possible.\n\nOne way is to delay or advance the time when we are on the dangerous freeways.\n\nFor example, for freeway 3, collision at t=3 if y=3.\n\nBut at other times, it might be safe.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 6.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, when it is unsafe, i.e., when 0 is in some car span.\n\nFor freeway k, at time t, unsafe if 0 in span for that freeway.\n\nThen for player, when on freeway y at time t, it must not be unsafe for that y and t.\n\ny_t must avoid the unsafe (y,t) pairs.\n\nBut y_t changes with actions.\n\nSince we start from t=0, y=0, and we need to reach y=9 at some t.\n\nThe minimal t to reach y=9 is t=9 if no delays, but with delays.\n\nEach U increases y, D decreases, S keeps.\n\nNet change must be +9, so number of U minus number of D must be 9.\n\nLet U be number of up actions, D down actions, S stay actions.\n\nThen U - D = 9, and total actions H = U + D + S.\n\nSince U - D =9, and H = U + D + S, we have H = (U + D) + S = ( (U-D) + 2D ) + S = 9 + 2D + S.\n\nSo to minimize H, we need to minimize D and S, ideally D=0, S=0, H=9.\n\nBut if not possible, we need S or D to avoid collisions.\n\nIn this case, for all U, we have collisions at t=3 and t=6.\n\nSo we need to change the timing for y=3 and y=6.\n\nFor y=3, collision at t=3, so we can be at y=3 at a different time.\n\nSimilarly for y=6.\n\nOther freeways might be safe at all times or have safe times.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, the times when it is unsafe.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, span at t: [-24-36t, 11-36t]\n\n0 in span if -24-36t <= 0 <= 11-36t\n\nAs before, -24-36t <=0 always for t>=0, and 0<=11-36t implies t <= 11/36 ≈0.305, so only at t=0, 0 in span.\n\nBut t=0 is turn 40, player at y=0, not on freeway, so no collision. For t>=1, no issue for freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly freeway 2 same, unsafe only at t=0, but player not there.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars.\n\nCar 1: span [-11+12t, 12t], 0 in if -11+12t <=0 <=12t\n\nWhich is t <= 11/12 and t>=0, so for t=0, -11<=0<=0? 0<=0 true, and -11<=0 true, so t=0.\n\nAt t=0, min=-11, max=0, so 0 included.\n\nBut t=0, player not on freeway.\n\nFor t=1, min=-11+12=1, max=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nt=0: min=-11+0=-11, max=0, so -11<=0<=0, yes.\n\nt=1: min=1, max=12, 0 not <=1? 0<1, not >=min, so no.\n\nSimilarly, only t=0.\n\nCar 1: 0 in [-11+12t, 12t] when -11+12t <=0 and 0<=12t.\n\n0<=12t always for t>=0.\n\n-11+12t <=0 => t <= 11/12, so t=0 only since t integer.\n\nAt t=0, min=-11, max=0, 0 included.\n\nAt t=1, min=1, max=12, min>0, 0 not in.\n\nCar 2: span [-47+12t, -36+12t]\n\n0 in if -47+12t <=0 <= -36+12t\n\nSo -47+12t <=0 and 0<= -36+12t\n\nFirst: -47+12t <=0 => 12t <=47 => t <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916, so t<=3\n\nSecond: 0 <= -36+12t => 12t >=36 => t>=3\n\nSo t>=3 and t<=3, thus t=3.\n\nAt t=3, min=-47+36= -11, max=-36+36=0, so [ -11,0], 0 included.\n\nAt other times, not.\n\nCar 3: [37+12t, 48+12t], min=37+12t >0 for t>=0, so 0 never in span.\n\nSo for freeway 3, unsafe only at t=3, because of car 2.\n\nAt t=3, 0 in car 2 span.\n\nOther times safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4 same as 3, so unsafe only at t=3.\n\nFreeway 5 same, unsafe only at t=3.\n\nNow freeway 6: one car, [-41+6t, -30+6t]\n\n0 in if -41+6t <=0 <= -30+6t\n\nSo -41+6t <=0 and 0<= -30+6t\n\nFirst: -41+6t <=0 => 6t <=41 => t <= 41/6 ≈6.833, t<=6\n\nSecond: 0 <= -30+6t => 6t >=30 => t>=5\n\nSo t>=5 and t<=6, so t=5 or t=6.\n\nAt t=5: min=-41+30= -11, max=-30+30=0, [ -11,0], 0 in\n\nAt t=6: min=-41+36= -5, max=-30+36=6, [-5,6], 0 in\n\nAt t=7: min=-41+42=1, max=12, [1,12], 0 not in\n\nSo unsafe at t=5 and t=6.\n\nFreeway 7 same as 6, unsafe at t=5 and t=6.\n\nNow freeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: same as above, [-41+6t, -30+6t], unsafe when t=5 or t=6.\n\nSecond car: [25+6t, 36+6t], min=25+6t >=25>0 for t>=0, so 0 never in span.\n\nSo for freeway 8, unsafe only when first car has 0 in span, i.e., t=5 or t=6.\n\nSummary of unsafe times for each freeway:\n\n- Freeway 1: unsafe at t=0, but player not there, so effectively safe for t>=1.\n\n- Freeway 2: same, safe for t>=1.\n\n- Freeway 3: unsafe at t=3\n\n- Freeway 4: unsafe at t=3\n\n- Freeway 5: unsafe at t=3\n\n- Freeway 6: unsafe at t=5,6\n\n- Freeway 7: unsafe at t=5,6\n\n- Freeway 8: unsafe at t=5,6\n\nNow, player must be on each freeway y from 1 to 8 at some time, but not at the unsafe times for that freeway.\n\nSince we can be on a freeway multiple times, but to minimize H, probably we go through each once, but we might need to stay or move down to avoid.\n\nThe path: we start at t=0, y=0.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nThe time when we are at each y must avoid the unsafe times for that y.\n\nBut since we move step by step, the times are sequential.\n\nLet t_y be the time when player is at y for the first time or something, but not necessarily, because we might revisit.\n\nTo minimize H, we should not revisit lower y if possible, because it would increase H.\n\nSimilarly, staying might increase H.\n\nSo probably, we go up as fast as possible, but adjust the timing so that for y=3, we are not at t=3, and for y=6, not at t=5 or 6.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nFirst, for freeways 1 and 2, they are safe at all t>=1, so no issue.\n\nFreeway 3,4,5 all unsafe only at t=3, so we need to not be on y=3,4,5 at t=3.\n\ny=3,4,5 are different freeways.\n\nFor each, we need to avoid being on that freeway at t=3.\n\nBut since they are all unsafe at t=3, we need that for y=3, we are not at y=3 at t=3; similarly for y=4 and y=5.\n\nNow for freeways 6,7,8 unsafe at t=5 and t=6, so we need not be on y=6,7,8 at t=5 or t=6.\n\nNow, in a direct path, with all U, we are at y=t at time t, so:\n\nAt t=1, y=1, safe\n\nt=2, y=2, safe\n\nt=3, y=3, unsafe (for freeway 3)\n\nt=4, y=4, but freeway 4 unsafe at t=3, not at t=4? Freeway 4 unsafe only at t=3, at t=4 it is safe.\n\nIn all U, at t=4, y=4, freeway 4, which is unsafe only at t=3, so at t=4 it is safe, as we saw earlier.\n\nSimilarly, t=5, y=5, freeway 5 unsafe at t=3, but at t=5 it is safe.\n\nt=6, y=6, unsafe for freeway 6.\n\nThe problem in all U is only at t=3 (y=3) and t=6 (y=6), since y=4 and y=5 are safe at t=4 and t=5.\n\ny=4 at t=4: freeway 4 safe at t=4, since unsafe only t=3.\n\nSimilarly y=5 at t=5: freeway 5 safe at t=5.\n\nOnly y=3 at t=3 and y=6 at t=6 are problems.\n\nWe need to avoid being at y=3 at time t=3, and at y=6 at time t=6.\n\nSince we start from y=0 at t=0, and go up.\n\nOne way is to delay reaching y=3.\n\nFor example, at t=0, y=0, we can stay (S) or move down, but moving down to y=-1 not possible, y>=0, so only S or U.\n\nIf we stay at t=0, y=0, then at t=1, still y=0 if S, or y=1 if U.\n\nBut y=0 is safe, no issue.\n\nTo avoid y=3 at t=3, we can be at a different y at t=3.\n\nFor instance, at t=2, if we are at y=2, we can stay instead of going up, so at t=3, y=2, then later go up.\n\nBut y=2 is freeway 2, which is safe at all t>=1, so at t=3, y=2 is safe.\n\nThen at t=4, we can go to y=3, but t=4, y=3, freeway 3.\n\nNow, freeway 3 unsafe only at t=3, at t=4 it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, for y=6, we need to avoid being at y=6 at t=6.\n\nNow, let's plan the path.\n\nStart: t=0, y=0\n\nOption: go U or S.\n\nIf U at t=0: to y=1 at t=1\n\nThen at t=1, y=1, can U to y=2 at t=2\n\nThen at t=2, y=2, if we U to y=3 at t=3, but collision, so instead, at t=2, we can S or D.\n\nIf S at t=2: stay y=2 at t=3\n\nThen at t=3, y=2, safe (freeway 2 safe)\n\nThen at t=3, we can U to y=3 at t=4\n\nAt t=4, y=3, freeway 3, now t=4, not t=3, so safe.\n\nThen from y=3 at t=4, we can U to y=4 at t=5\n\nAt t=5, y=4, freeway 4, unsafe? Freeway 4 unsafe only at t=3, at t=5 safe.\n\nSimilarly, U to y=5 at t=6\n\nAt t=6, y=5, freeway 5, unsafe only at t=3, at t=6 safe.\n\nThen U to y=6 at t=7\n\nNow at t=7, y=6, freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 6 unsafe at t=5 and t=6, but at t=7, it is safe, as min=1, max=12 for freeway 6 car at t=7.\n\nEarlier: min=-41+42=1, max=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen U to y=7 at t=8\n\nAt t=8, y=7, freeway 7, unsafe at t=5,6? Freeway 7 same as 6, unsafe at t=5,6, at t=8: min=-41+48=7, max=-30+48=18? Freeway 7 car: same as freeway 6, [-41+6t, -30+6t]\n\nAt t=8, min=-41+48=7, max=-30+48=18, [7,18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen U to y=8 at t=9\n\nAt t=9, y=8, freeway 8, which has cars, unsafe at t=5,6, but at t=9: first car min=-41+54=13, max=-30+54=24? t=9, s=6, min=-41+54=13, max=-30+54=24, [13,24]\n\nSecond car min=25+54=79, max=36+54=90, all >0, so safe.\n\nThen U to y=9 at t=10\n\nAt t=10, y=9, goal.\n\nNow, total turns: from t=0 to t=10, we have actions from t=0 to t=9, 10 actions? Let's list the actions.\n\nTime: after each action, position changes.\n\nAt time t, after action a_t, position y_{t+1}.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt time t (step index), we take action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nStart: t=0, y_0 = 0\n\nAfter a_0, y_1\n\nAfter a_1, y_2\n\n...\n\nAfter a_{H-1}, y_H =9\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nt=0: take action, to y_1\n\nI need to specify actions for t=0 to H-1.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nAt t=0: let's say we take U, so y_1 = 0 +1 =1\n\nIn my earlier plan: I said at t=0 go U to y=1 at t=1.\n\nSet t as the time after action.\n\nPerhaps better to think of the state at time t.\n\nSet: at time t (t=0,1,2,...), the player position is y_t.\n\nAt each time t, we choose action a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nCollision is checked at time t based on y_t, but only if y_t in 1-8.\n\nIn the collision condition: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if ... for freeway y_T\"\n\nAnd turn T is the time.\n\nAt turn T, player is at y_T, and if y_T in 1-8, check for collision.\n\nIn terms of our t, at time t, position y_t.\n\nIn my earlier simulation, for all U, at t=3, y_3=3, collision.\n\nNow in the alternative:\n\nWe need to avoid y_t =3 at t=3.\n\nSimilarly for y=6 at t=6.\n\nIn the path I described:\n\nStart t=0, y_0=0\n\nTake a_0: U, so y_1 =1\n\nt=1, y_1=1, take a_1: U, y_2=2\n\nt=2, y_2=2, take a_2: S (stay), so y_3 = y_2 +0 =2\n\nNow at t=3, y_3=2, which is freeway 2, and freeway 2 is safe at t=3, as we saw.\n\nThen at t=3, take a_3: U, so y_4 = y_3 +1 =3\n\nAt t=4, y_4=3, freeway 3. Now time t=4, not t=3, so freeway 3 is safe at t=4, since unsafe only at t=3.\n\nThen take a_4: U, y_5 =4\n\nt=5, y_5=4, freeway 4, safe at t=5.\n\nTake a_5: U, y_6=5\n\nt=6, y_6=5, freeway 5, safe at t=6.\n\nTake a_6: U, y_7=6\n\nt=7, y_7=6, freeway 6. Now t=7, freeway 6 unsafe at t=5,6, but t=7 safe, as min=1, max=12? Earlier calculation: for freeway 6, at t=7, span [-41+42, -30+42] = [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTake a_7: U, y_8=7\n\nt=8, y_8=7, freeway 7, at t=8, min=-41+48=7, max=18, [7,18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTake a_8: U, y_9=8\n\nt=9, y_9=8, freeway 8, at t=9, first car min=-41+54=13, max=24, [13,24], 0 not in; second car [25+54,36+54]=[79,90], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTake a_9: U, y_10=9\n\nt=10, y_10=9, goal, not a freeway, safe.\n\nSo we reached at t=10, with actions: U, U, S, U, U, U, U, U, U, U? Let's list actions.\n\nActions from t=0 to t=9.\n\na_t for t=0 to 9:\n\nt=0: U (to y=1)\n\nt=1: U (to y=2)\n\nt=2: S (stay y=2)\n\nt=3: U (to y=3)\n\nt=4: U (to y=4)\n\nt=5: U (to y=5)\n\nt=6: U (to y=6)\n\nt=7: U (to y=7)\n\nt=8: U (to y=8)\n\nt=9: U (to y=9)\n\ny_10=9 at t=10.\n\nH=10 actions, from t=0 to t=9.\n\nBut is this minimal?\n\nEarlier with all U, we could reach in 9, but had collisions, so not possible.\n\nCan we reach in less than 10?\n\nH=10 means 10 turns, but we started at t=0, ended at t=10, after 10 actions.\n\nMinimal possible is 9, but not achievable due to collisions.\n\nCould we avoid the collisions with fewer extra actions?\n\nIn this case, we used one stay action at t=2, so we have S instead of U, so we delayed by one turn.\n\nFor y=6, in this path, we are at y=6 at t=7, which is safe, whereas in all U we were at t=6 unsafe.\n\nBut we didn't need to add extra for y=6 because we were late.\n\nIn all U, we had problem at t=6 y=6, but by delaying earlier, we are at y=6 later, which is fine.\n\nCould we reach in 9 turns with some down or other?\n\nFor example, to avoid t=3 for y=3.\n\nSuppose at t=2, instead of staying, we go down? But from y=2, if we go down to y=1 at t=3.\n\nThen at t=3, y=1, freeway 1, which is safe at t=3.\n\nThen we need to go back up, which might take more turns.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=0: U to y=1\n\nt=1: U to y=2\n\nt=2: D to y=1 at t=3\n\nt=3: y=1, safe\n\nThen t=3: U to y=2 at t=4\n\nt=4: U to y=3 at t=5\n\nBut at t=5, y=3, freeway 3, now t=5, not t=3, so safe? Freeway 3 unsafe only at t=3, so at t=5 safe.\n\nThen continue: U to y=4 at t=6\n\nBut at t=6, y=4, freeway 4 safe? Yes.\n\nBut now we need to go to y=5,6,etc.\n\nBut at t=6, if y=4, then U to y=5 at t=7\n\nt=7: y=5, freeway 5 safe\n\nU to y=6 at t=8\n\nt=8: y=6, freeway 6 at t=8.\n\nFreeway 6 unsafe at t=5,6, at t=8: min=-41+48=7, max=18? t=8, s=6, min=-41+48=7, max=-30+48=18, [7,18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen U to y=7 at t=9\n\nt=9: y=7, freeway 7 at t=9: min=-41+54=13, max=24, [13,24], safe\n\nThen U to y=8 at t=10\n\nt=10: y=8, freeway 8 at t=10: first car min=-41+60=19, max=30, [19,30]; second car min=25+60=85, max=96, safe\n\nThen U to y=9 at t=11\n\nNow we reached at t=11, with more turns: actions from t=0 to t=10, 11 actions? Let's see: started y=0 at t=0, after actions to y=11 at t=11? No.\n\ny_t at time t.\n\nt=0: y=0\n\na0: D? No, in this sequence:\n\nt=0: a0=U, y1=1\n\nt=1: a1=U, y2=2\n\nt=2: a2=D, y3=2-1=1\n\nt=3: a3=U, y4=1+1=2\n\nt=4: a4=U, y5=3\n\nt=5: y5=3\n\nThen a5=U, y6=4\n\nt=6: y6=4\n\na6=U, y7=5\n\nt=7: y7=5\n\na7=U, y8=6\n\nt=8: y8=6\n\na8=U, y9=7\n\nt=9: y9=7\n\na9=U, y10=8\n\nt=10: y10=8\n\na10=U, y11=9\n\nt=11: y11=9\n\nSo after 11 actions, reached at t=11, worse than previous 10.\n\nSo not better.\n\nIn the first plan with one stay, we have H=10.\n\nBut can we do with H=9?\n\nSuppose we start immediately.\n\nt=0: if we stay, y1=0 (if S)\n\nThen t=1: y1=0, take U to y2=1\n\nt=2: U to y3=2\n\nt=3: now at y3=2, if we go U to y4=3 at t=4? At t=3, we are at y=2.\n\nIf we go U at t=3, to y4=3 at t=4.\n\nThen t=4: y4=3, which is safe for freeway 3 since t=4.\n\nThen U to y5=4 at t=5, safe\n\nU to y6=5 at t=6, but at t=6, y=5, freeway 5 safe? Yes, but we need to go to y=6.\n\nAt t=6, if y=5, then U to y7=6 at t=7.\n\nt=7: y7=6, freeway 6 at t=7, safe as before.\n\nThen U to y8=7 at t=8, safe\n\nU to y9=8 at t=9, freeway 8 at t=9, safe\n\nU to y10=9 at t=10.\n\nStill t=10, same as before.\n\nIn this case, we started with S at t=0, but ended at same time.\n\nt=0: S, y1=0\n\nt=1: U, y2=1\n\nt=2: U, y3=2\n\nt=3: U, y4=3\n\nt=4: U, y5=4\n\nt=5: U, y6=5\n\nt=6: U, y7=6\n\nt=7: U, y8=7\n\nt=8: U, y9=8\n\nt=9: U, y10=9\n\nReached at t=10, with one extra stay at beginning, but same H=10 actions.\n\nBut we used S instead of a U, so delayed.\n\nIn the first sequence, we had actions: U,U,S,U,U,U,U,U,U,U — 10 actions.\n\nIn this: S,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U,U — still 10 actions to reach y10=9.\n\nBut y starts from 0.\n\nNow, to reach in 9 turns, we need y9=9.\n\nThat means we must increase y by 9 in 9 actions, so all U, no S or D.\n\nBut all U causes collision at t=3 and t=6.\n\nUnless we can be at different positions.\n\nFor example, at t=3, if we are not at y=3, but in all U, we must be at y=3 at t=3 if we start from 0.\n\nIf we start with U at t=0, to y=1 at t=1\n\nU at t=1 to y=2 at t=2\n\nU at t=2 to y=3 at t=3 — collision.\n\nIf we do something else, like at t=2, we cannot avoid going to y=3 at t=3 if we go U, or stay at y=2, or go down to y=1, but then not at y=3.\n\nBut to reach y=9 in 9 actions, we must have exactly 9 U and 0 S or D, so we must be at y=t at time t for t=1 to 9.\n\ny_t = t for t=1 to 9, with y0=0.\n\nAt t=3, y=3, collision; at t=6, y=6, collision.\n\nAnd we cannot prevent that with all U.\n\nTherefore, impossible to reach in 9 turns without collision.\n\nThus minimal H is 10.\n\nIn the first sequence, we have one S action.\n\nBut in that sequence, we also avoided the t=6 collision by being at y=6 later.\n\nNow, for freeway 6, unsafe at t=5 and t=6, but in our path, we were at y=6 at t=7, safe.\n\nCould we be at y=6 earlier? For example, at t=4 or something, but in all U, we are at y=6 at t=6.\n\nIf we go faster, but we start from y=0, we cannot be faster than all U.\n\nMinimal time to y=6 is t=6 with all U.\n\nBut at t=6 it is unsafe.\n\nIf we go slower, we arrive later, which is safe at t=7 or later.\n\nBut t=5 is also unsafe for y=6.\n\nFreeway 6 unsafe at t=5 and t=6.\n\nAt t=5, if we were at y=6, but with all U, at t=5 we are at y=5, not y=6.\n\nTo be at y=6 at t=5, we need to have moved faster, but from y=0 to y=6 in 5 actions, impossible since each action changes by at most 1, so y6 <=6, but to have y5=6, we need to increase by 6 in 5 actions, which requires at least one D or S? No, with 5 U, y5=5, cannot be 6.\n\nMax y at t=5 is 5 with all U.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=6 at t=5.\n\nSimilarly, at t=6, we can be at y=6 with U actions.\n\nBut unsafe.\n\nAt t=7, we can be at y=6, safe.\n\nSimilarly for other points.\n\nSo in our sequence, with one stay, we have H=10.\n\nBut in the sequence, we used S at t=2.\n\nNow, back to the answer.\n\nIn the sequence I have:\n\nActions:\n\nTurn t1 (40): a_{40} = U  (since t=0, action a_{t1} = a_{40})\n\nIn the answer format, it should be for turns starting from t1.\n\nCurrent turn is t1=40.\n\nWe need actions a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for t=0, a_{40}, t=1, a_{41}, etc.\n\nIn my notation, t=0 corresponds to turn 40.\n\nSo a_{40}: action at turn 40.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAt turn 40 (t=0): action U, to y=1 at next turn.\n\nBut collision is at the turn when position is set.\n\nAt turn 40, position is (0,0), which is safe.\n\nAfter action a_{40}, position at turn 41 is (0,1)\n\nThen at turn 41, position (0,1), which is freeway 1, check collision.\n\nIn my earlier plan:\n\nTurn 40: action U, so at turn 41, position y=1\n\nTurn 41: action U, at turn 42, y=2\n\nTurn 42: action S, so at turn 43, y=2 (since S, no change)\n\nTurn 43: action U, at turn 44, y=3\n\nTurn 44: action U, at turn 45, y=4\n\nTurn 45: action U, at turn 46, y=5\n\nTurn 46: action U, at turn 47, y=6\n\nTurn 47: action U, at turn 48, y=7\n\nTurn 48: action U, at turn 49, y=8\n\nTurn 49: action U, at turn 50, y=9\n\nNow, check collisions at each turn when y between 1 and 8.\n\nTurn 41: y=1, freeway 1. At time, since t1=40, time t=1 (since turn 41 is t1+1=41, t=1)\n\nCar on freeway 1: span at t=1: [-24-36(1), 11-36(1)] = [-60,-25], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 42: y=2, freeway 2. Similarly, at t=2, span [-24-72,11-72]=[-96,-61], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 43: y=2, freeway 2, same as above, at t=3? Turn 43 is t1 +3, t=3.\n\nSpan at t=3: [-24-108,11-108]=[-132,-97], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 44: y=3, freeway 3. Turn 44 is t=4 (since t1=40, turn 44 is t=4)\n\nFreeway 3 at t=4: car 1: [-11+12(4), 12(4)] = [-11+48,48] = [37,48], 0 not in\n\nCar 2: [-47+48, -36+48] = [1,12], 0 not in (min=1>0)\n\nCar 3: [37+48,48+48]=[85,96], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 45: y=4, freeway 4, same cars, t=5? Turn 45 is t=5.\n\nAt t=5: car1: [-11+60,60]=[49,60]\n\nCar2: [-47+60,-36+60]=[13,24]\n\nCar3: [37+60,48+60]=[97,108], all >0, safe.\n\nTurn 46: y=5, freeway 5, t=6.\n\nSimilar, safe.\n\nTurn 47: y=6, freeway 6. Turn 47 is t=7.\n\nCar: [-41+6(7), -30+6(7)] = [-41+42, -30+42] = [1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 48: y=7, freeway 7. t=8, car [-41+48, -30+48]=[7,18], 0 not in, safe.\n\nTurn 49: y=8, freeway 8. t=9.\n\nFirst car: [-41+54, -30+54]=[13,24]\n\nSecond car: [25+54,36+54]=[79,90], 0 not in, safe.\n\nThen turn 50: y=9, goal.\n\nAll safe.\n\nH=10 actions.\n\nBut is there a sequence with H=9? I think not, as reasoned.\n\nPerhaps we can avoid the stay by moving differently.\n\nFor example, suppose we go up to y=2, then at t=2, instead of stay, we go down? But that would make it worse.\n\nOr, for the y=6 problem.\n\nIn all U, at t=5, y=5, safe; t=6, y=6, unsafe.\n\nIf at t=5, we stay, so at t=6, y=5, then at t=6, go U to y=6 at t=7.\n\nBut then we need to reach y=9 later.\n\nFor example:\n\nt=0: U to y=1\n\nt=1: U to y=2\n\nt=2: U to y=3? But at t=3, y=3, collision if we go U.\n\nTo avoid y=3 at t=3.\n\nSuppose we go slower at the beginning.\n\nt=0: U to y=1\n\nt=1: S, stay y=1\n\nt=2: U to y=2\n\nt=3: U to y=3 at t=4? At t=3, position y=2 if we did S at t=1 and U at t=2.\n\nSequence:\n\nt=0: a0=U, y1=1\n\nt=1: a1=S, y2=1 (stay)\n\nt=2: a2=U, y3=2\n\nt=3: a3=U, y4=3\n\nAt t=4, y=3, freeway 3 at t=4, safe as before.\n\nThen t=4: U to y5=4\n\nt=5: U to y6=5? y5=4, U to y6=5\n\nAt t=5, y=5, freeway 5, safe.\n\nNow at t=5, y=5, but we need to go to y=6.\n\nAt t=5, if we go U to y6=6 at t=6.\n\nBut at t=6, y=6, freeway 6, unsafe.\n\nSo we can at t=5, stay: a5=S, y6=5\n\nThen at t=6, y=5, safe\n\nThen at t=6, U to y7=6 at t=7\n\nt=7: y=6, freeway 6 at t=7, safe\n\nThen U to y8=7 at t=8\n\nU to y9=8 at t=9\n\nU to y10=9 at t=10\n\nStill t=10, and we used two stays: at t=1 and t=5, worse.\n\nTo reach faster, but we cannot.\n\nAnother idea: since freeway 3 is only unsafe at t=3, we can be at y=3 at other times.\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 6, unsafe at t=5,6.\n\nBut to be at y=3 at t=4, as before.\n\nBut in all cases, to go from 0 to 9, with one delay, H=10 is minimal.\n\nPerhaps we can start by going down, but y=0 is minimum, cannot go down.\n\nSo I think H=10 is minimal.\n\nNow, in the sequence, we have actions.\n\nBut in the answer, it should be for turns starting from t1=40.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: S\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: U\n\nTurn 45: U\n\nTurn 46: U\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nAfter turn 49 action U, at turn 50, y=9.\n\nH=10 actions.\n\nBut the sequence is for t=0 to 9, actions a_{40} to a_{49}.\n\nIn the boxed answer.\n\nBut the player reaches at turn 50, which is after H=10 turns.\n\nNow, to confirm, is there a shorter way?\n\nSuppose we go up to y=4 quickly or something, but we have to pass through each y.\n\nFor example, to be at y=3 at t=4, which we did.\n\nFor y=6, if we can be at t=4, but with all U, at t=4 y=4, not y=6.\n\nImpossible.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nThus the minimal H is 10.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 40: U\n\nTurn 41: U\n\nTurn 42: S\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: U\n\nTurn 45: U\n\nTurn 46: U\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nIn the answer format.\n\nBut let's write it properly.\n</think>\nTo reach the goal position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 0) at turn 40 in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8, the sequence of actions must ensure that the player is not on a freeway when a car occupies x=0 at that turn. The analysis shows that a direct upward path (all \"U\" actions) results in collisions at turn 43 (y=3) and turn 46 (y=6). To avoid these, a minimal delay is introduced by staying at y=2 for one turn (action \"S\" at turn 42), shifting the timing to bypass the unsafe states. This results in a path with 10 actions, reaching y=9 at turn 50.\n\nThe unsafe times for the freeways are:\n- Freeway 3, 4, 5: Unsafe only at turn 43 (relative turn t=3).\n- Freeway 6, 7, 8: Unsafe at turns 45 and 46 (relative turns t=5 and t=6).\n\nThe sequence below avoids all collisions:\n- At turn 40 (y=0), move up to y=1 at turn 41 (safe, as freeway 1 is unsafe only at turn 40, but player is not on freeway at turn 40).\n- At turn 41 (y=1), move up to y=2 at turn 42 (freeway 2 is safe at all t ≥ 1).\n- At turn 42 (y=2), stay to remain at y=2 for turn 43 (freeway 2 is safe at turn 43).\n- At turn 43 (y=2), move up to y=3 at turn 44 (freeway 3 is safe at turn 44, as unsafe only at turn 43).\n- At turn 44 (y=3), move up to y=4 at turn 45 (freeway 4 is safe at turn 45).\n- At turn 45 (y=4), move up to y=5 at turn 46 (freeway 5 is safe at turn 46).\n- At turn 46 (y=5), move up to y=6 at turn 47 (freeway 6 is safe at turn 47, as unsafe only at turns 45 and 46).\n- At turn 47 (y=6), move up to y=7 at turn 48 (freeway 7 is safe at turn 48).\n- At turn 48 (y=7), move up to y=8 at turn 49 (freeway 8 is safe at turn 49).\n- At turn 49 (y=8), move up to y=9 at turn 50 (goal reached, y=9 is safe).\n\nThis sequence uses 10 turns (H=10), which is minimal, as H=9 is impossible due to collisions at turns 43 and 46 in the all-up path.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 40: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 41: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 42: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 43: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 44: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 45: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 46: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 47: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 48: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 49: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>We are given the current turn t1 = 41 and the player is at (0,1). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways y=1 to 8.\n\nPlayer moves: \n  U: y increases by 1 (unless at y=9, then stays)\n  D: y decreases by 1 (unless at y=0, then stays)\n  S: stay at same y.\n\nCollision rule: At turn T, if the player is at freeway y (which is between 1 and 8) and the car's span (for that freeway) at turn T contains 0, then collision.\n\nImportant: When moving from y to y+1 (or y-1) at turn T, at that exact turn T the player is still on the current freeway y (and will be on y+1 at the next turn). So at turn T, we only check the freeway we are currently on (y_T) for collision.\n\nGiven car states at turn t1 (41):\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-60, -25, left, 36) -> left-moving, so span [h, tau] = [-60, -25] (since head is at -60 and tail at -25? But note: for left-moving, head is the leftmost? Actually, the update rule says:\n  Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> at T: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n  Right-moving: [tau, h] -> at T: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut the car state is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). So:\n\nFor freeway 1: car = (-60, -25, left, 36). Since it's left-moving, the head is the leftmost? Actually, the update rule for left-moving uses [h, tau] and moves left. So at t1, the car occupies from -60 to -25? But note: the car is moving left, so the head (which is the front) is at the left? Actually, the problem says \"head\" and \"tail\". For left-moving, the head is the left end? The update rule uses [h, tau] for left and [tau, h] for right? But the problem says for left: [h, tau] becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. So the entire car moves left by s per turn.\n\nSimilarly, for right: [tau, h] becomes [tau+s*(T-t1), h+s*(T-t1)] -> so the car moves right.\n\nBut note: in the state for freeway 3,4,5 we have three cars. We must consider all cars on the freeway.\n\nWe are at turn 41. We start at y=1.\n\nWe must avoid being at a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at a turn T when there is a car on that freeway such that 0 is in the car's span at that exact turn.\n\nLet me denote the time offset: let τ = T - t1 = T - 41.\n\nSo for a car on freeway k, at time T (which is 41 + τ), the car's span:\n\nFor a left-moving car (h, tau, left, s): \n  h(T) = h - s * τ\n  tail(T) = tau - s * τ\n  so span: [h - s*τ, tau - s*τ]   (note: since left-moving, and the head is at the left, so the span is from h to tau? But note: the head is the front? Actually, the problem says \"head\" and \"tail\". For left-moving, the head is the leftmost? The update rule uses [h, tau] and moves both left. So the entire segment [h, tau] moves left. So the car occupies [h - s*τ, tau - s*τ] at time T.\n\nFor a right-moving car (h, tau, right, s):\n  The update rule says: [tau, h] becomes [tau + s*τ, h + s*τ]. So the car occupies [tau + s*τ, h + s*τ] at time T.\n\nCollision at freeway k at time T if the player is at (0,k) and for at least one car on freeway k, the car's span at T contains 0.\n\nWe start at turn 41 at y=1. We need to get to y=9.\n\nWe can plan a path: we can move up, down, or stay. But we want minimal H.\n\nThe minimal vertical distance: from 1 to 9 is 8. So at least 8 moves upward. But we might have to wait (use S) to avoid cars.\n\nWe must avoid collisions on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nWe are going to simulate the moves and the car positions as time passes (τ = 0,1,2,...).\n\nWe'll try to find the minimal H such that we can go from y=1 to y=9 in H-1 steps? Actually, the sequence is from t=0 to H-1: meaning from turn t1 (41) to turn t1+H-1. So at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). The number of turns in the sequence is H.\n\nWe start at τ=0 (turn 41) at y=1. Then we take an action at τ=0 (which affects the position at τ=1? Actually, the update: at turn t, we choose a_t, then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at turn 41 (τ=0): we are at y=1. Then we choose a_41. Then at turn 42 (τ=1): we are at y_42 = y_41 + Δy_41.\n\nBut note: at turn 41, we are at y=1. We must check collision at turn 41? Yes. So at τ=0 (turn 41), we are on freeway 1. We must check if freeway 1 has a car such that 0 is in the span at τ=0.\n\nFreeway 1: car = (-60, -25, left, 36). At τ=0: span = [-60, -25]. 0 is not in [-60, -25]? -> no collision.\n\nThen we choose an action. We can go up (to y=2 at next turn), down (to y=0, but then we have to come back, probably not helpful), or stay (y=1).\n\nBut note: if we stay at y=1, then at the next turn (τ=1, turn42) we are still at y=1? Actually, if we choose S at τ=0, then at τ=1 we are still at y=1.\n\nBut at each turn, we are at a freeway and must check collision for that turn.\n\nWe'll try to compute the car positions at each freeway for the next few τ.\n\nFirst, let's list all cars and their positions at time τ (relative to turn41).\n\nFreeway 1: left-moving, s=36. \n  At τ: [h(τ), tau(τ)] = [-60 - 36*τ, -25 - 36*τ]\n  0 is in the span if: -60-36τ <= 0 <= -25-36τ.\n  But note: since the car is moving left, the entire segment is decreasing. And the segment is 35 units long? (-25 - (-60) = 35.\n\n  Solve: -60 -36τ <= 0 and 0 <= -25 -36τ -> \n    First: -36τ <= 60 -> τ >= -60/36 = -1.66 (which is always true for τ>=0)\n    Second: 0 <= -25 -36τ -> 36τ <= -25 -> τ <= -25/36 -> which is negative -> never true.\n\n  So actually, the car is entirely to the left of 0? Because at τ=0: [-60,-25] -> all negative. And as τ increases, it moves left, so never covers 0.\n\n  Therefore, freeway 1 is always safe? \n\nBut wait: the problem says collision if 0 is in the span. At τ=0: [-60,-25] -> 0 is not in there. And as τ increases, the segment moves left, so 0 remains to the right of the entire car. So freeway 1 is safe for all τ.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: (-60,-25,left,36) -> same as above: always safe.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: \n  (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12), (60,49,right,12)\n\n  For a right-moving car: the span at τ: [tau + 12*τ, h + 12*τ]\n\n  First car: (h=12, tau=1) -> wait, the state is given as (head, tail, ...). But for right-moving, the update uses [tau, h]? Actually, the state is (head, tail, direction, speed). The problem does not specify which is which? But the update rule for right uses [tau, h] and moves to [tau+sτ, h+sτ]. So what is tau and h in the state?\n\n  Looking at the update rule: \n    For right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, h]\" -> so at t1, the car is from tau to h (with tau < h, because it moves right). \n\n  So the state for the first car: (head=12, tail=1, right,12) -> so at t1, the car is from 1 to 12? Then at τ: [1+12τ, 12+12τ]\n\n  Second car: (head=-24? tail=-35, right,12) -> but wait, head=-24 and tail=-35? Then the car is from -35 to -24? Because [tau, h] = [-35, -24]. Then at τ: [-35+12τ, -24+12τ]\n\n  Third car: (60,49,right,12): [49+12τ, 60+12τ]\n\n  Now, collision at freeway 3 at time τ if 0 is in any of these intervals.\n\n  First car: 0 in [1+12τ, 12+12τ] -> \n      1+12τ <= 0 <= 12+12τ -> \n        left: 12τ <= -1 -> τ <= -1/12 -> not possible for τ>=0.\n      So never.\n\n  Second car: 0 in [-35+12τ, -24+12τ] -> \n      -35+12τ <= 0 <= -24+12τ\n        left: 12τ <= 35 -> τ <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916\n        right: 0 <= -24+12τ -> 12τ >= 24 -> τ>=2\n      So for τ in [2, 2.916] -> τ=2 and τ=3? \n        τ=2: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11, 0] -> 0 is included? The interval is [-11,0] -> closed? The problem doesn't specify, but we assume closed? So yes, 0 is in [-11,0] at τ=2.\n        τ=3: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12] -> 0 not in.\n\n      So at τ=2 (which is turn 41+2=43) the second car covers 0.\n\n  Third car: 0 in [49+12τ, 60+12τ] -> \n      49+12τ <= 0 <= 60+12τ -> \n        left: 12τ <= -49 -> τ <= -49/12 -> impossible.\n\n  So freeway 3: unsafe at τ=2 (turn43) and τ=3? Wait at τ=2: we have the second car: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0] -> 0 is the right endpoint. So included.\n\n  Actually, the problem says \"span\" and we assume closed intervals? Yes, because the update uses inclusive? The problem doesn't specify, but to be safe, we assume 0 is included at τ=2.\n\n  But note: at τ=2, the car is at [-11,0]. So it covers x=0.\n\n  So freeway 3 is unsafe at τ=2? Actually, τ=2 corresponds to turn 41+2 = 43.\n\n  Also, what about τ=3? The second car at τ=3: [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12] -> does not cover 0.\n\n  So freeway 3: unsafe at τ=2 only? Actually, τ=2: the second car covers 0. And τ=2 is the only integer τ in [2, 35/12) -> only τ=2.\n\n  Therefore, at freeway 3, we must avoid being there at τ=2 (turn43).\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3: three cars. So same: unsafe at τ=2.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 3: unsafe at τ=2.\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (-24,-35,right,6) -> \n  But note: direction is right? The state: (head=-24, tail=-35, right,6). \n  For right-moving: [tau, h] = [-35, -24] at τ=0? Then at τ: [-35+6τ, -24+6τ]\n\n  0 in this interval: \n      -35+6τ <= 0 <= -24+6τ\n        left: 6τ <= 35 -> τ <= 35/6 ≈ 5.833\n        right: 0 <= -24+6τ -> 6τ>=24 -> τ>=4\n      So τ in [4,5.833] -> τ=4,5.\n\n  At τ=4: [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0] -> 0 included.\n  At τ=5: [-35+30, -24+30] = [-5,6] -> 0 included? yes.\n\n  So freeway6: unsafe at τ=4,5 (turns 45,46)\n\nFreeway7: same as freeway6: one car (-24,-35,right,6) -> unsafe at τ=4,5.\n\nFreeway8: two cars: (-24,-35,right,6) and (42,31,right,6)\n\n  First car: same as above: unsafe at τ=4,5.\n\n  Second car: (42,31,right,6): [31+6τ, 42+6τ] -> \n      0 in [31+6τ,42+6τ] -> \n          31+6τ <=0 -> 6τ<=-31 -> impossible.\n\n  So freeway8: unsafe at τ=4,5.\n\nSummary of unsafe (freeway, time in τ) pairs:\n\nfreeway3: τ=2\nfreeway4: τ=2\nfreeway5: τ=2\nfreeway6: τ=4,5\nfreeway7: τ=4,5\nfreeway8: τ=4,5\n\nNote: freeway1 and 2 are safe at all times.\n\nOur goal: go from y=1 at τ=0 to y=9 at some τ=H-1 (so we have H steps: from τ=0 to τ=H-1, and we take H actions: at τ=0,1,...,H-1, and the position at τ=H is the result after H actions? Actually, we start at τ=0 (turn41) at y=1.\n\nAfter one action (at τ=0) we are at τ=1 (turn42) at y = y0 + Δy0.\n\nWe must avoid being at a freeway at a time when that freeway is unsafe.\n\nWe are going to simulate the possible paths. Since we want minimal H, we try to go up as fast as possible.\n\nThe minimal H is at least 8 (to go from 1 to 9). But we might have to wait.\n\nLet me try to go up without waiting:\n\nτ0 (turn41): at y=1 (safe). We choose U -> then at τ1 (turn42): y=2.\n\nAt τ1: we are at y=2. Is y=2 safe at τ1? \n  Freeway2: we have a car? But freeway2 is safe at all times? Yes. So safe.\n\nThen we choose U: at τ2 (turn43): y=3.\n\nAt τ2: freeway3 -> unsafe at τ2? Yes, because τ2=2 -> freeway3 is unsafe. So collision.\n\nSo we cannot go up at τ1 (from y=2 to y=3) because at the next turn (τ2) we land on freeway3 which is unsafe.\n\nAlternative: at τ1 (turn42, y=2) we don't go up? But we have to eventually. Or we wait at y=2? \n\nBut note: we can also go down? But that seems counterproductive.\n\nSo at τ1 (turn42): we are at y=2. Instead of going up, we could:\n\nOption 1: Stay at y=2 at τ1 (so at turn42 we are at y=2). Then at τ2 (turn43): we are still at y=2. Then we can go up at τ2 to y=3 at τ3 (turn44).\n\nBut at τ2 (turn43): we are at y=2 -> freeway2 is safe (always). Then we choose U at τ2: then at τ3 (turn44) we are at y=3.\n\nNow, at τ3 (turn44): freeway3. Is freeway3 safe at τ3? \n  We know freeway3 is unsafe only at τ=2. τ3=3 -> safe? \n  Because the unsafe time for freeway3 is only τ=2.\n\nSo at τ3: freeway3 is safe.\n\nThen we can continue up.\n\nBut we also have to check the higher freeways.\n\nPlan:\n\nτ0 (turn41): start at y=1 -> safe. Choose U -> to y=2 at τ1.\nτ1 (turn42): at y=2 -> safe. Choose S (stay) -> so at τ2: still at y=2.\nτ2 (turn43): at y=2 -> safe. Choose U -> to y=3 at τ3 (turn44).\nτ3 (turn44): at y=3 -> freeway3: τ=3 (which is safe, because unsafe only at τ=2). Then choose U -> to y=4 at τ4 (turn45).\nτ4 (turn45): at y=4 -> freeway4: at τ=4? \n  We know freeway4 is unsafe at τ=2? But τ=4 is safe? \n  But wait: we have freeway4 unsafe only at τ=2? Same as freeway3? \n  Yes, because the car configuration is the same.\n\n  So safe.\n\nThen we go U: to y=5 at τ5 (turn46).\nτ5 (turn46): at y=5 -> freeway5: τ=5? unsafe only at τ=2? -> safe. Then U to y=6 at τ6 (turn47).\nτ6 (turn47): at y=6 -> freeway6: unsafe at τ=4,5? τ6=6 -> safe? \n  Because τ=4,5 are unsafe, but τ=6: \n      freeway6: car: [-35+6*6, -24+6*6] = [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12] -> does not cover 0 -> safe.\n\nThen U: to y=7 at τ7 (turn48).\nτ7 (turn48): at y=7 -> freeway7: at τ=7? \n  freeway7: car: same as freeway6: [-35+6*7, -24+6*7] = [-35+42, -24+42] = [7,18] -> does not cover 0 -> safe.\nThen U: to y=8 at τ8 (turn49).\nτ8 (turn49): at y=8 -> freeway8: at τ=8? \n  freeway8 has two cars:\n      car1: same: [-35+6*8, -24+6*8] = [-35+48, -24+48] = [13,24] -> safe.\n      car2: [31+6*8, 42+6*8] = [31+48,42+48] = [79,90] -> safe.\n  So safe.\nThen U: to y=9 at τ9 (turn50).\n\nBut we are at y=9 at τ9? And we are done? Because the goal is to be at (0,9).\n\nHow many actions? We took actions at τ0 to τ8: that's 9 actions? \n  τ0: U (to y2 at τ1)\n  τ1: S (stay at y2 at τ2)\n  τ2: U (to y3 at τ3)\n  τ3: U (to y4 at τ4)\n  τ4: U (to y5 at τ5)\n  τ5: U (to y6 at τ6)\n  τ6: U (to y7 at τ7)\n  τ7: U (to y8 at τ8)\n  τ8: U (to y9 at τ9)\n\nSo H=9? But note: we start at τ0 and we take actions for t = t1 to t1+8 (9 actions) and we are at y9 at turn t1+9? \n\nWait: \n  At turn41 (τ0): we start at y1.\n  After action at τ0 (turn41): at turn42 (τ1): y2.\n  ...\n  After action at τ8 (turn49): at turn50 (τ9): y9.\n\nSo we reach at turn50, which is 50 - 41 = 9 steps? But the number of actions is 9.\n\nBut the minimal without waiting would be 8: 8 ups. But we had to wait one step at y2.\n\nIs there a way with 8?\n\nWe avoided freeway3 at τ2 by waiting at y2. But could we avoid by going faster? \n\nAlternatively, we could have gone up to y3 earlier? But freeway3 is unsafe only at τ2. If we were at y3 at τ1, that would be safe? \n\nBut how? We start at y1 at τ0. To be at y3 at τ1: we would have to go up twice in one step? Not possible.\n\nOr at τ0: we go up to y2 at τ1. Then at τ1: we go up to y3 at τ2. But at τ2 we land on y3 and it's unsafe.\n\nSo we must avoid being at y3 at τ2.\n\nWe could go down? But that would take more steps.\n\nAnother idea: go up to y4 quickly? But to get to y4, we have to pass y3 at some time.\n\nLet me try:\n\nτ0: at y1 -> safe. U to y2 at τ1.\nτ1: at y2 -> safe. U to y3 at τ2 -> but at τ2, we are at y3 -> unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot.\n\nWe could at τ0: stay at y1? Then at τ1: still at y1. Then at τ1: go up to y2 at τ2. Then at τ2: we are at y2 (safe). Then at τ2: go up to y3 at τ3 (which is safe, because τ3=3, freeway3 safe). Then we are at y3 at τ3. Then we can go up without waiting until y9.\n\nBut now: \n  τ0: S (stay at y1) -> then at τ1: y1 -> we must check freeway1 at τ1? \n      freeway1: at τ1: [-60-36, -25-36] = [-96,-61] -> safe.\n  τ1: U -> to y2 at τ2.\n  τ2: at y2 -> safe. Then U to y3 at τ3.\n  τ3: at y3 -> safe (τ3=3). Then U to y4 at τ4 -> safe? freeway4 at τ4: unsafe only at τ2? so safe.\n  Then continue: \n      τ4: U to y5 at τ5 -> freeway5: safe at τ5 (since unsafe only at τ2)\n      τ5: U to y6 at τ6 -> freeway6: at τ6=6: safe (as above: [1,12] at τ6? no, for freeway6: at τ6: [-35+6*6, -24+6*6] = [1,12] -> safe)\n      τ6: U to y7 at τ7 -> freeway7: at τ7: [7,18] -> safe.\n      τ7: U to y8 at τ8 -> freeway8: at τ8: [13,24] and [79,90] -> safe.\n      τ8: U to y9 at τ9.\n\nSo we used 9 actions again? \n  Actions: \n      τ0: S\n      τ1: U\n      τ2: U\n      τ3: U\n      τ4: U\n      τ5: U\n      τ6: U\n      τ7: U\n      τ8: U\n\nThat's 9 actions. Same as before.\n\nBut note: in the first plan we had one wait at y2 (at τ1 we did S). In this plan we had one wait at y1 (at τ0 we did S). Both are 9 steps.\n\nCan we do 8? \n\nWe must avoid freeway3 at τ2. So we must not be at freeway3 at τ2.\n\nWe start at y1 at τ0.\n\nAt τ1: we can be at y0, y1, or y2.\n\nAt τ2: we can be at y0 (if we went down twice? not helpful), y1 (if we did: from y1: then at τ1: S then at τ1: still y1; then at τ2: if we go down to y0? or stay? or up to y2), or y2 (if we went up then up, or up then stay, or stay then up) or y3 (if we went up then up).\n\nBut if we are at y3 at τ2, we die.\n\nSo the only possibilities for τ2: y0, y1, y2.\n\nThen at τ3: we can be at y1, y2, y3, y4? \n\nBut we want to get to y9 as fast as possible.\n\nWithout waiting, we would be at y3 at τ2 (which we avoid). So we must have at least one wait.\n\nBut wait: is there a way to be at y4 at τ3? \n\nTo be at y4 at τ3:\n  We start at y1 at τ0.\n  Then:\n    τ0: action: U -> at τ1: y2.\n    τ1: action: U -> at τ2: y3 -> but at τ2 we are at y3 -> unsafe.\n\n  Or:\n    τ0: U -> τ1: y2.\n    τ1: U -> τ2: y3 -> unsafe.\n\n  Or if we do two ups at τ0 and τ1, we get to y3 at τ2 -> unsafe.\n\n  Alternatively: \n    τ0: U -> τ1: y2.\n    τ1: U -> τ2: y3 -> unsafe -> not allowed.\n\n  Or if we do:\n    τ0: U -> τ1: y2.\n    τ1: D? -> then at τ2: y1? Then at τ2 we are at y1 -> safe? \n        Then at τ2: we are at y1. Then we can go up: \n        τ2: U -> τ3: y2.\n        τ3: U -> τ4: y3 -> which is at τ4: freeway3 safe? (since unsafe only at τ2) -> safe.\n        Then continue: \n            τ4: U -> y4 at τ5 -> freeway4: safe at τ5? (unsafe only at τ2) -> safe.\n            τ5: U -> y5 at τ6 -> freeway5: safe at τ6? safe.\n            τ6: U -> y6 at τ7 -> freeway6: at τ7: [ -35+6*7, -24+6*7] = [7,18] -> safe.\n            τ7: U -> y7 at τ8 -> freeway7: safe? same as above: [7,18] -> safe.\n            τ8: U -> y8 at τ9 -> freeway8: safe? [13,24] and [79,90] -> safe.\n            τ9: U -> y9 at τ10.\n\n        That's 10 actions: worse.\n\nSo minimal is 9.\n\nBut can we avoid the wait by using a different path? For example, skip freeway3 by going through it at a safe time? We have to go through freeway3 at either τ1, τ3, τ4, ... but not τ2.\n\nIn the first plan, we went through freeway3 at τ3 (turn44) which is safe.\n\nNow, what about the higher freeways? We have to avoid freeway6,7,8 at τ=4 and τ=5.\n\nIn our plan, when do we hit freeway6? \n\nIn the first plan (wait at y2 at τ1):\n\n  We are at:\n      τ0: y1 -> freeway1: safe.\n      τ1: y2 -> freeway2: safe.\n      τ2: y2 -> freeway2: safe (by staying)\n      τ3: y3 -> freeway3: safe (τ3=3)\n      τ4: y4 -> freeway4: safe (τ4=4 -> but freeway4 unsafe only at τ2 -> safe)\n      τ5: y5 -> freeway5: safe (τ5=5 -> unsafe only at τ2? safe)\n      τ6: y6 -> freeway6: τ6=6 -> safe? \n          freeway6: car at [1,12] -> does not cover 0 -> safe.\n      τ7: y7 -> freeway7: τ7=7 -> [7,18] -> safe.\n      τ8: y8 -> freeway8: τ8=8 -> safe.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nBut wait: freeway6 is unsafe at τ=4 and τ=5. We are at freeway6 at τ6=6 -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, in the second plan (wait at y1 at τ0) we are at freeway6 at τ6=6 -> safe.\n\nBut what if we try to go faster? We want to see if we can do it in 8.\n\nSuppose we try to wait at a higher freeway? But we have to avoid freeway3 at τ2.\n\nWe must be at y3 at τ3 at the earliest. Then we have to go from y3 to y9: that's 6 moves, so at τ9 we are at y9. That's 9 steps.\n\nAlternatively, if we can be at y3 at τ3, then we can be at y9 at τ9? \n\nBut we have to avoid freeway6 at τ4 and τ5? \n\nWhen we are at freeway6? \n\nWe are at freeway6 when we are at y6.\n\nWe are at y6 at τ? \n\nFrom y3 at τ3: \n  τ3: y3 -> then we do U at τ3: y4 at τ4.\n  τ4: y4 -> U: y5 at τ5.\n  τ5: y5 -> U: y6 at τ6.\n\nSo at τ6 we are at y6 -> safe? (τ6=6, freeway6 safe at τ6).\n\nSo no problem.\n\nBut we still use 9 steps.\n\nIs there a way to be at y9 at τ8? \n\nThat would require being at y1 at τ0, and then 8 moves: but 8 moves of U would get us to y9 at τ8? \n\nBut we have to avoid freeway3 at τ2. How? \n\nTo be at y9 at τ8: \n  We must be at y8 at τ7, because we need one move to get from y8 to y9.\n\n  How to get to y8 at τ7? \n      We start at y1 at τ0.\n      We need to cover 7 levels in 7 moves? \n\n      The positions: \n          τ0: y1\n          τ1: y?\n          τ2: y?\n          τ3: y?\n          τ4: y?\n          τ5: y?\n          τ6: y?\n          τ7: y8\n\n      The net change: from y1 to y8: 7 up moves. So we must have exactly 7 U moves and 1 S or D? But we have 7 moves to cover 7 steps? Actually, we have 7 actions (from τ0 to τ6) to get to y8 at τ7.\n\n      So 7 U moves: then we would be at y1+7 = y8 at τ7? \n\n      But the moves: \n          τ0: U -> y2 at τ1\n          τ1: U -> y3 at τ2 -> but at τ2 we are at y3 -> unsafe.\n\n      So we cannot.\n\n      If we do 6 U and 1 S? Then we end at y1+6 = y7 at τ7? Not y8.\n\n      Or 7 U and 1 D? Then net +6 -> y7.\n\n      So we cannot get to y8 at τ7 with 7 moves? We start at y1, and we have 7 actions: the maximum we can get is y1+7 = y8? But we have to avoid the collision at y3 at τ2.\n\n      How? We must not be at y3 at τ2.\n\n      So at τ2 we must be at a different y. \n\n      The positions:\n          τ0: y1\n          τ1: after first action: can be y0, y1, y2.\n          τ2: after second action: \n                if at τ1: y0 -> then at τ2: y0 (S), y1 (U), or y-1 (D) but y>=0 -> so y0 or y1.\n                if at τ1: y1 -> then at τ2: y0, y1, y2.\n                if at τ1: y2 -> then at τ2: y1, y2, y3.\n\n      So to be at y8 at τ7, we must have 7 U moves. But if we do U at τ0, we go to y2 at τ1? Then if we do U at τ1, we go to y3 at τ2 -> unsafe. So we must not do U at τ1? \n\n      Then at τ1: from y2 we do S -> then at τ2: y2. Then we are safe. Then we do U at τ2: to y3 at τ3 -> safe. Then we have to do 5 more U moves? \n\n      Then:\n          τ3: y3 -> U to y4 at τ4\n          τ4: y4 -> U to y5 at τ5\n          τ5: y5 -> U to y6 at τ6\n          τ6: y6 -> U to y7 at τ7\n          τ7: y7 -> but we need to be at y8 at τ7? \n\n      At τ7 we are at y7. Then we need one more U to get to y8 at τ8, and then one more U to get to y9 at τ9.\n\n      So that's 9.\n\n      Alternatively, at τ6: we are at y6, then we do two U moves? But we can only do one action per turn. So we need two more actions: at τ6 and τ7 to get from y6 to y8? \n\n      Actually: \n          τ6: at y6 -> U: to y7 at τ7.\n          τ7: at y7 -> U: to y8 at τ8.\n\n      Then τ8: at y8 -> U: to y9 at τ9.\n\n      So total 9 actions.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 9.\n\nNow, we have two plans that work. We can choose either.\n\nBut note: we also have to avoid freeway6,7,8 at τ=4 and τ=5. In our plan, we are at freeway6 at τ6 (which is safe) and freeway7 at τ7 (safe) and freeway8 at τ8 (safe). \n\nBut what if we are at freeway6 earlier? In the plan we are at freeway6 at τ6. \n\nBut in the first plan (wait at y2 at τ1) we are:\n\n  τ0: y1 -> freeway1: safe\n  τ1: y2 -> freeway2: safe\n  τ2: y2 -> freeway2: safe\n  τ3: y3 -> freeway3: safe\n  τ4: y4 -> freeway4: safe\n  τ5: y5 -> freeway5: safe\n  τ6: y6 -> freeway6: safe\n\nSo we are at freeway5 at τ5: which is safe because freeway5 unsafe only at τ2.\n\nBut what about freeway6? We are not at freeway6 until τ6.\n\nSimilarly, in the second plan (wait at y1 at τ0) we are:\n\n  τ0: y1 -> freeway1: safe\n  τ1: y1 -> freeway1: safe\n  τ2: y2 -> freeway2: safe\n  τ3: y3 -> freeway3: safe\n  τ4: y4 -> freeway4: safe\n  τ5: y5 -> freeway5: safe\n  τ6: y6 -> freeway6: safe\n\nSame.\n\nNow, is there any other constraint? \n\nWhat about freeway8? In our plan we are at freeway8 at τ8: \n  freeway8: at τ8=8: \n      car1: [-35+6*8, -24+6*8] = [13,24] -> safe\n      car2: [31+6*8,42+6*8]=[79,90] -> safe.\n\nSo safe.\n\nNow, we must output the actions.\n\nWe can choose either plan. Let me choose the first one (wait at y2 at τ1).\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 41: U   (from y1 to y2 at next turn)\nTurn 42: S   (stay at y2: so at turn43, we are still at y2)\nTurn 43: U   (to y3 at turn44)\nTurn 44: U   (to y4 at turn45)\nTurn 45: U   (to y5 at turn46)\nTurn 46: U   (to y6 at turn47)\nTurn 47: U   (to y7 at turn48)\nTurn 48: U   (to y8 at turn49)\nTurn 49: U   (to y9 at turn50)\n\nSo 9 actions.\n\nBut note: the sequence is for t from t1 (41) to t1+8 (49). The last action is at turn49, and after that at turn50 we are at y9.\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" such that we reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1? \n\nWait: the player update: at turn t, we do action a_t, and then at turn t+1 we are at the new position.\n\nWe start at turn41 at y1.\n\nAfter action a_41 (at turn41), we are at turn42 at y2.\n...\nAfter action a_49 (at turn49), we are at turn50 at y9.\n\nSo the turn when we reach (0,9) is turn50, which is t1 + 9? \n\nBut the sequence is from t=41 to t=49 (9 actions). Then at the next turn (turn50) we are at the goal.\n\nThe problem says: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\".\n\nSo: t1 + H - 1 = 50 -> 41 + H - 1 = 50 -> H-1 = 9 -> H=10? \n\nBut wait: the sequence of actions is for t from t1 to t1+H-1. \n\nWe have actions at 41,42,...,49: that's 9 actions (H=9). Then at the next turn (50) we are at y9.\n\nBut the problem says: we take actions at t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1, and then at the turn after the last action we are at the goal? \n\nActually, the goal is to be at (0,9) at the turn t1+H-1? \n\nLet me read: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then at the end of these actions, we are at (0,9)? \n\nBut note: the state after the action a_t is at turn t+1.\n\nThe problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence ... to reach (0,9)\".\n\nAnd then: \"such that y_{t1+H-1} = 9\".\n\nSo we require that at turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nIn our sequence: \n  Turn41: a41 -> then at turn42: y42 = y41 + Δy41 = 1 + 1 = 2.\n  ...\n  Turn49: a49 -> then at turn50: y50 = y49 + Δy49 = 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nSo we are at y9 at turn50.\n\nWe want: t1 + H - 1 = 50 -> 41 + H - 1 = 50 -> 40 + H = 50 -> H=10.\n\nBut we have 9 actions. How is H defined? \n\nThe problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\" and then the sequence has H actions? \n\nBut note: the sequence is for t from 0 to H-1, so the number of actions is H.\n\nBut in the answer format, we write:\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1}\nTurn t1+1: a_{t1+1}\n...\nTurn t1+H-1: a_{t1+H-1}\n\nSo the last action is at turn t1+H-1.\n\nAnd we require that at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9)? \n\nBut in the update, after we do the last action (at turn t1+H-1), we are at the next turn (t1+H) at the new position. \n\nBut the problem says: \"y_{t1+H-1} = 9\". \n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLook at the problem: \n  \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}\\}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nand then: \"such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nSo at the turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nBut in our update: \n  y_{t} is the position at the beginning of turn t? \n\nThe problem says: \"Player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t\"\n\nSo at the beginning of turn t, we are at y_t. Then we choose a_t, and then at the beginning of turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}.\n\nTherefore, we are at y_t at turn t.\n\nWe want at turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nAt turn t1 (41), we are at y1.\n\nWe need to be at y9 at turn t1+H-1.\n\nHow many steps? From turn41 to turn t1+H-1, we have (t1+H-1 - t1) = H-1 turns? \n\nBut we start at turn41 at y1, and we want to be at turn t1+H-1 at y9.\n\nThe number of turns that pass: (t1+H-1) - t1 = H-1.\n\nIn each turn, we take an action that may change the y.\n\nWe have to go from y1 to y9: a net change of +8.\n\nEach U gives +1, D gives -1, S gives 0.\n\nSo we need at least 8 U moves.\n\nBut we also have to account for the waiting.\n\nWe are at turn41: y1.\n\nWe want to be at turn t (which we set to t1+H-1) at y9.\n\nThe minimal H-1 would be 8? Then H=9.\n\nBut we found that we need 9 actions? \n\nWait: if we do 8 U moves without waiting, we would be at y9 at turn41+8 = turn49.\n\nBut at turn49, we are at y9? \n\nHow? \n  turn41: y1 -> then we do U at turn41: at turn42: y2.\n  U at turn42: turn43: y3 -> but at turn43 we are at y3 and it's unsafe? \n\nBut if we avoid the unsafe times, can we be at y9 at turn49?\n\nLet me try:\n\n  We must avoid freeway3 at turn43 (which is τ2: 43-41=2).\n\n  To be at y9 at turn49 (which is τ=8: 49-41=8), we start at y1 at turn41.\n\n  We have 8 actions: from turn41 to turn48.\n\n  We need to cover 8 levels.\n\n  So we must do 8 U moves? Then:\n      turn41: U -> turn42: y2\n      turn42: U -> turn43: y3 -> unsafe at turn43? because freeway3 at τ=2 (turn43) is unsafe.\n\n  So we cannot.\n\n  Therefore, we must take at least 9 actions? Then H-1 = 9? \n\n  But then the turn we are at y9 is turn41+9 = turn50.\n\n  And we require: y_{t1+H-1} = y_{41+H-1} = y50 = 9.\n\n  So H-1 = 9? -> H=10.\n\n  And the actions: from turn41 to turn49 (9 actions).\n\n  Then at turn50, we are at y9.\n\n  So the minimal H is 10.\n\nBut the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence has H actions? \n\nBut in the answer format, we write H actions? \n\nBut if H=10, then we write 10 actions? \n\nBut we only have 9 actions in our plan? \n\nWait: if we do 9 actions, then the last action is at turn49, and then at turn50 we are at y9. \n\nBut we are at y9 at turn50, which is t1+9.\n\nWe want y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nSo: 41 + H - 1 = 50 -> H-1 = 9 -> H=10.\n\nBut then the sequence should have H=10 actions? \n\nBut we only used 9 actions. \n\nWhat action do we do at turn50? We don't need to do any action after we reach the goal. \n\nBut the problem requires a sequence of H actions that ends with us at the goal at turn t1+H-1.\n\nIf we do 9 actions (from turn41 to turn49), then at turn50 we are at the goal. But turn50 is t1+9, which would be t1+H-1 if H=10? \n\nBut then we must specify 10 actions? \n\nBut we have only done 9. \n\nAlternatively, we might need to include an extra action at turn50? But that doesn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps the last action is the one that gets us to the goal? \n\nBut according to the update rule, the action at turn t affects y_{t+1}.\n\nSo to be at y9 at turn50, we did the last U at turn49.\n\nSo the sequence of actions is for turn41 to turn49: 9 actions.\n\nAnd then at turn50, we are at y9.\n\nBut the problem says: we must have y_{t1+H-1} = 9.\n\nIf we set H=10, then t1+H-1 = 41+10-1=50 -> y50=9, which matches.\n\nAnd the sequence has H=10 actions? But we have only 9.\n\nThe sequence is defined for t=0 to H-1: so t1 + t for t=0,...,9 -> turns 41 to 50.\n\nBut we don't need an action at turn50? Because after turn49, we are already at y9 at turn50.\n\nBut the problem requires an action for each turn from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAnd at the last turn (t1+H-1=50), we are at y9 at the beginning of turn50. Then we choose an action? But we are already at the goal.\n\nWe can choose any action? But if we choose U, we try to go to y10, but y cannot be above 9, so we stay at y9.\n\nSimilarly, D: to y8? which is bad. Or S: stay.\n\nSo to be safe, we should choose S at turn50.\n\nBut then we reach y9 at turn50, and then at turn50 we do an action (S) and then at turn51 we are still at y9.\n\nBut the goal is to reach (0,9), which we do at turn50. But the problem doesn't say we have to stop; it says to reach (0,9). So we reach at turn50, and then we can do whatever.\n\nBut the minimal H might be defined as the number of turns until we first reach (0,9). \n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence of H actions that gets us there at turn t1+H-1.\n\nIn this case, we first reach (0,9) at turn50, so H-1 = 50-41 = 9, so H=10.\n\nAnd the sequence has 10 actions: the first 9 as above, and the 10th action (at turn50) can be S.\n\nSo the actions:\n\n  Turn41: U\n  Turn42: S\n  Turn43: U\n  Turn44: U\n  Turn45: U\n  Turn46: U\n  Turn47: U\n  Turn48: U\n  Turn49: U\n  Turn50: S   (but at turn50 we are already at y9, so we do S to stay)\n\nBut is this minimal? We could avoid the last S? \n\nThe problem requires that we reach (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. So if we reach at turn50, then we set H=10 and the last action is at turn50.\n\nBut note: we reached at turn50, so we don't need to do any action after that. But the sequence must have H actions, including the turns after we reach the goal? \n\nThe problem doesn't say we stop after reaching. It says \"to reach (0,9)\", so once we reach, the subsequent actions don't matter? \n\nBut we can choose the minimal H such that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9). \n\nWith our plan, we are at (0,9) at turn50 = t1+9.\n\nSo t1+H-1 = 41+H-1 = 50 -> H=10.\n\nAnd we have to provide 10 actions? But the first 9 are necessary to get there, and the 10th can be arbitrary? \n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions ... to reach (0,9)\", so the sequence should be such that at some point during the sequence we reach (0,9)? But the condition is that at turn t1+H-1 we are at (0,9).\n\nSo if we do 10 actions, then at turn50 (which is the beginning of the last action) we are at (0,9), and then we do the last action.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n  Actions 1 to 9: as above (U, S, U, U, U, U, U, U, U) -> then at turn50: we are at y9.\n  Then action at turn50: we can do S (stay).\n\nBut we could also do U at turn50? Then we try to go to y10, but it will be clamped to 9. So it's the same as S.\n\nOr D? Then we go to y8, which is not the goal, but the goal is already reached at the beginning of turn50. The action at turn50 doesn't change the fact that we were at y9 at turn50.\n\nBut the problem only requires that at turn t1+H-1 (which is turn50) we are at (0,9). What we do after that doesn't affect that.\n\nSo we can choose any action for the last one.\n\nBut to be safe, we choose S.\n\nBut is there a sequence with H=9? That would mean we are at (0,9) at turn41+9-1=49.\n\nCan we be at y9 at turn49?\n\nWe start at turn41: y1.\n\nWe need to cover 8 levels in 8 turns (from turn41 to turn49, but note: at turn49 we are at y9).\n\nThe actions: from turn41 to turn48 (8 actions).\n\nWe must do 8 U moves? Then:\n\n  turn41: U -> turn42: y2\n  turn42: U -> turn43: y3 -> unsafe (because at turn43: freeway3 is unsafe)\n\n  So we cannot.\n\n  We might do 7 U and 1 S? Then we end at y1+7 = y8 at turn49? not y9.\n\n  Or 8 U and 1 D? But we only have 8 actions: net +7 -> y8.\n\n  So we cannot get to y9 at turn49.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 10.\n\nAnd the sequence has 10 actions.\n\nWe can use the plan:\n\n  Turn41: U   -> to y2 at turn42\n  Turn42: S   -> stay at y2 at turn43\n  Turn43: U   -> to y3 at turn44\n  Turn44: U   -> to y4 at turn45\n  Turn45: U   -> to y5 at turn46\n  Turn46: U   -> to y6 at turn47\n  Turn47: U   -> to y7 at turn48\n  Turn48: U   -> to y8 at turn49\n  Turn49: U   -> to y9 at turn50\n  Turn50: S   -> stay at y9 at turn51\n\nBut at turn50, we are at y9. And then we do S at turn50, so at turn51 we are still at y9.\n\nThe problem only cares that at turn50 (t1+H-1 = 41+10-1=50) we are at y9.\n\nSo it's satisfied.\n\nWe could also do without the last S? But the sequence must have 10 actions, so we must specify an action for turn50.\n\nWe can choose U, D, or S. But if we choose D at turn50, then at turn51 we would be at y8, which is not the goal, but the goal is already achieved at turn50. So it's acceptable.\n\nBut to be clean, we choose S.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the other plan (wait at y1 at τ0):\n\n  Turn41: S   -> stay at y1 at turn42\n  Turn42: U   -> to y2 at turn43\n  Turn43: U   -> to y3 at turn44\n  Turn44: U   -> to y4 at turn45\n  Turn45: U   -> to y5 at turn46\n  Turn46: U   -> to y6 at turn47\n  Turn47: U   -> to y7 at turn48\n  Turn48: U   -> to y8 at turn49\n  Turn49: U   -> to y9 at turn50\n  Turn50: S   -> stay at turn51\n\nAlso 10 actions.\n\nBoth work.\n\nI'll choose the first one.\n\nAnswer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 41: U\nTurn 42: S\nTurn 43: U\nTurn 44: U\nTurn 45: U\nTurn 46: U\nTurn 47: U\nTurn 48: U\nTurn 49: U\nTurn 50: S\n}\n\nBut wait: the last action is at turn50, which is t1+9, and H=10, so t1+H-1=41+10-1=50, which is the turn we are at y9 at the beginning. Then we do S at turn50.\n\nThis meets the requirement.\n\nWe can verify the collision:\n\nAt turn41: y1 -> safe (freeway1: car at [-60,-25] -> safe)\nAt turn42: we are at y2 (after U at turn41) -> freeway2: safe.\nAt turn43: we are at y2 (after S at turn42) -> freeway2: safe.\nAt turn44: we are at y3 (after U at turn43) -> freeway3: at τ=3 (44-41=3): safe (unsafe only at τ=2).\nAt turn45: y4 -> freeway4: τ=4: safe.\nAt turn46: y5 -> freeway5: τ=5: safe.\nAt turn47: y6 -> freeway6: τ=6: car at [1,12] -> safe.\nAt turn48: y7 -> freeway7: τ=7: [7,18] -> safe.\nAt turn49: y8 -> freeway8: τ=8: [13,24] and [79,90] -> safe.\nAt turn50: y9 -> goal. Then we do S.\n\nNote: at turn50, we are at y9, which is not a freeway (freeways are 1-8), so no collision check.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 1)\\) at turn 41 is 10.

The player can move up, down, or stay, changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move left or right at given speeds. For collision, at any turn T, if the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, if 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at that turn, then there's a collision. But note, when you move to a new y, you're not on that y until the next turn. So at turn T, you're on y_T, and you choose an action to go to y_{T+1}. At turn T, you're on y_T, so you check cars on y_T at turn T. When you arrive at y_{T+1} at turn T+1, you check cars on y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nThe collision rule says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\" And y_T is the player's position at turn T.\n\nAlso, \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T, thus will NOT be collided by cars on y_{T+1} if 0 ∈ Span(T) but 0 ∉ Span(T+1).\" But since at turn T, you're on y_T, you only care about y_T at turn T. When you're moving, at turn T, you're still on y_T, so you check cars on y_T at T. At turn T+1, you're on y_{T+1}, so you check cars on y_{T+1} at T+1. So the note is consistent.\n\nI need to find the minimal H and a sequence of actions from turn t1=42 to turn t1+H-1, such that at turn t1+H-1, y=9.\n\nCurrent y=2, target y=9, so I need to increase y by 7. Since I can only change by +1 or -1 or 0 each turn, the minimum H without any cars would be 7, if I go up every turn. But with cars, I might have to wait or go around, but since I can only move vertically, and cars are on horizontal freeways, I have to pass through each y from 2 to 9, but I can skip some if I move faster, but no, I have to go through each integer y, I think. Since y changes by at most 1, I must visit each y between start and end if I go directly, but I might go down and up to avoid collisions, which could take more turns.\n\nBut in this case, since I need to go from 2 to 9, and cars are on y=1 to 8, but y=1 and y=9 are not freeways, I think? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars. Player starts at (0,2), which is on freeway y=2? Positions are (x,y), but x is always 0 for player? The grid is 2D, but player is always at x=0? Let me see.\n\nThe player position is given as (0, y_t), so x=0 always for player. The cars are on freeways, which are horizontal lines at y=1 to y=8. Each freeway has cars moving left or right.\n\nFor the player, at each turn, they are at (0, y_t), so when y_t is between 1 and 8, they are on a freeway and must avoid cars at that position at that turn.\n\nAt y=0 and y=9, no cars, so safe.\n\nStart at y=2, which is freeway 2, so I need to check cars on y=2 at turn 42.\n\nTarget is (0,9), which is safe.\n\nNow, I need to go from y=2 to y=9, increasing y by 7, so minimum 7 turns if no obstacles.\n\nBut with cars, I might need to wait or move down temporarily.\n\nFirst, I need to model the car positions over time.\n\nLet t be the turn number, starting from t1=42.\n\nFor each freeway k, and each car on it, given initial head, tail, direction, speed at turn t1=42.\n\nThen for any future turn T, the span can be calculated.\n\nFor left-moving cars: direction left, so at turn T, span is [h - s*(T-42), τ - s*(T-42)]? Let me see the update.\n\nFrom the rule:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t1), τ - s (T-t1)]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t1), h + s (T-t1)]\n\nIn the table, for each car, head and tail are given, and direction.\n\nFor left-moving, head and tail, with head > tail I assume, since it's moving left, so h is the right end? Let's see.\n\nFor freeway 1: (48, 83, left, 36)\n\n48 and 83, but 48 < 83, and direction left. In the span, for left-moving, [h, τ], but if h=48, τ=83, 48<83, but if moving left, the head should be the front, which for left-moving, smaller x is left, so if moving left, head should be at smaller x? I'm confused.\n\nLet me interpret.\n\nAssume x-axis, increasing to the right.\n\nFor a left-moving car, it is moving towards decreasing x.\n\nSo, at time t, the car occupies some interval [x_min, x_max], with x_min < x_max, and since moving left, the head is at x_min? Or head at x_max?\n\nThe notation: \"head at h, tail at τ\", and for left-moving, span [h, τ].\n\nBut in freeway 1: (48,83,left,36), 48 and 83, 48<83, so if [h,τ] = [48,83], that means from x=48 to x=83, but moving left, so head is at left end or right end?\n\nTypically, head is the front. For left-moving, front is left, so smaller x.\n\nHere h=48, τ=83, 48<83, so if [48,83], and moving left, the head should be at 48, tail at 83? But tail is longer, so when moving left, the car extends from head at front (left) to tail at back (right), so span [head, tail] with head < tail.\n\nThen moving left, after time Δt, both decrease by s*Δt.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: direction right, span [τ, h], with τ and h, but for right-moving, head is at right, tail at left, so [τ, h] with τ < h, moving right, so span from τ to h, with τ left, h right.\n\nIn freeway 3: (24,13,right,12), 24 and 13, 24>13, and direction right, span [τ, h] = [13,24]? τ=13, h=24? But it says (head, tail, direction, speed), so for this car, head=24, tail=13, direction right.\n\nThen for right-moving, span(t1) = [τ, h] = [13,24], since τ=13, h=24.\n\nThen at time T, span(T) = [τ + s(T-t1), h + s(T-t1)] = [13 + 12(T-42), 24 + 12(T-42)]\n\nSimilarly for left-moving.\n\nAlso, collision when player is at (0,y) at turn T, so x=0, and for freeway y, if there is a car where 0 is in the span, i.e., min(span) ≤ 0 ≤ max(span).\n\nSince span is an interval, 0 ∈ [min, max] inclusive.\n\nNow, for each freeway, I need to find when x=0 is occupied by a car at that freeway at turn T.\n\nThat is, for a given k and T, is there a car on freeway k such that 0 in its span at T.\n\nIf not, then y=k is safe at T.\n\nPlayer can be at y=k only if k is between 0 and 9, and at turn T, if y_T = k, and if 1≤k≤8, then must have no car on k at T with 0 in span.\n\nNow, let's list all freeways and their cars.\n\nCurrent turn t1=42.\n\nFreeway 1: one car (48,83,left,36) → span at t1: [48,83], moving left, speed 36.\n\nSince moving left, and x=0, we care when the car covers x=0.\n\nThe left end starts at 48 and decreases at 36 per turn.\n\nSet t relative to t1, so let Δt = T - 42.\n\nThen for left-moving car: span at T: [h - s Δt, τ - s Δt] = [48 - 36 Δt, 83 - 36 Δt]\n\n0 is covered when min ≤ 0 ≤ max, so 48 - 36 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 83 - 36 Δt\n\nSince 48 - 36 Δt ≤ 0 and 83 - 36 Δt ≥ 0? But we need both min ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ max, but since min < max, it's min ≤ 0 ≤ max.\n\nSo 48 - 36 Δt ≤ 0 and 83 - 36 Δt ≥ 0.\n\nFirst inequality: 48 - 36 Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 48 ≤ 36 Δt ⇒ Δt ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so Δt ≥ 2 since integer turns.\n\nΔt is integer, since turns are discrete.\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 83 - 36 Δt ≥ 0 ⇒ 36 Δt ≤ 83 ⇒ Δt ≤ 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so Δt ≤ 2.\n\nSo Δt ≥ 2 and Δt ≤ 2? From first: Δt ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈1.333, so since Δt integer, Δt ≥ 2.\n\nFrom second: Δt ≤ 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so Δt ≤ 2.\n\nThus Δt=2.\n\nSo at Δt=2, T=44, min=48-36*2=48-72=-24 ≤0, max=83-72=11 ≥0, so yes, 0 in [-24,11].\n\nAt other times, for example Δt=1, min=48-36=12 >0, so min=12, max=83-36=47, both >0, 0 not covered.\n\nΔt=0, min=48, max=83, both >0.\n\nΔt=3, min=48-108=-60, max=83-108=-25, both <0, 0 not covered.\n\nSo only at T=44, freeway 1 is occupied at x=0.\n\nT=42 + Δt, Δt=2, T=44.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? (48,83,left,36), identical to freeway 1.\n\nSo also occupied only at T=44.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (24,13,right,12)\n\nHead=24, tail=13, direction right.\n\nFor right-moving, span at t1: [τ, h] = [13,24] since τ=13, h=24.\n\nThen at T: [τ + s Δt, h + s Δt] = [13 + 12 Δt, 24 + 12 Δt]\n\n0 in span when 13 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 24 + 12 Δt\n\nBut 13 + 12 Δt ≥ 13 >0 for Δt≥0, so min ≥13 >0, so 0 never covered. Similarly, max >0 always. So this car never covers x=0.\n\nSecond car: (-12,-23,right,12)\n\nHead=-12, tail=-23, direction right.\n\nτ = tail = -23, h = head = -12.\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [-23, -12]\n\nAt T: [-23 + 12 Δt, -12 + 12 Δt]\n\n0 in span when -23 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -12 + 12 Δt\n\nFirst inequality: -23 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 12 Δt ≤ 23 ⇒ Δt ≤ 23/12 ≈ 1.916, so Δt ≤ 1\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ -12 + 12 Δt ⇒ 12 ≤ 12 Δt ⇒ Δt ≥ 1\n\nSo Δt=1.\n\nAt Δt=1, min=-23+12=-11 ≤0, max=-12+12=0 ≤0? 0 ≤ max=0, so 0 is included, since it says 0 ∈ span, and span includes endpoints I assume.\n\nSimilarly, min=-11≤0≤0=max, so yes.\n\nFor other Δt, not.\n\nThird car: (-48,-59,right,12)\n\nHead=-48, tail=-59, direction right.\n\nτ = tail = -59, h = head = -48\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nAt T: [-59 + 12 Δt, -48 + 12 Δt]\n\n0 in span: -59 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -48 + 12 Δt\n\nFirst: -59 + 12 Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 12 Δt ≤ 59 ⇒ Δt ≤ 59/12 ≈ 4.916, Δt ≤ 4\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -48 + 12 Δt ⇒ 48 ≤ 12 Δt ⇒ Δt ≥ 4\n\nSo Δt=4.\n\nAt Δt=4, min=-59+48=-11 ≤0, max=-48+48=0 ≤0, so 0 in [-11,0].\n\nNow, for freeway 3, we have three cars, but at different times:\n\nFirst car never covers 0.\n\nSecond car covers 0 at Δt=1, T=43\n\nThird car covers 0 at Δt=4, T=46\n\nSo freeway 3 occupied at x=0 when:\n\nAt T=43 (from second car) and T=46 (from third car)\n\nT=42 + Δt, Δt=1, T=43; Δt=4, T=46.\n\nNow freeway 4: same cars as freeway 3? \" (24,13,right,12), (-12,-23,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12) \" identical to freeway 3.\n\nSo same: occupied at T=43 and T=46.\n\nFreeway 5: also identical, same as 3 and 4.\n\nSo occupied at T=43 and T=46.\n\nNow freeway 6: one car (-18,-29,right,6)\n\nHead=-18, tail=-29, direction right.\n\nτ = tail = -29, h = head = -18\n\nSpan at t1: [τ, h] = [-29, -18]\n\nAt T: [-29 + 6 Δt, -18 + 6 Δt]\n\n0 in span: -29 + 6 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ -18 + 6 Δt\n\nFirst: -29 + 6 Δt ≤ 0 ⇒ 6 Δt ≤ 29 ⇒ Δt ≤ 29/6 ≈ 4.833, Δt ≤ 4\n\nSecond: 0 ≤ -18 + 6 Δt ⇒ 18 ≤ 6 Δt ⇒ Δt ≥ 3\n\nSo Δt=3 or 4? Δt ≥3 and Δt ≤4.\n\nAt Δt=3: min=-29+18=-11 ≤0, max=-18+18=0 ≤0, so 0 in [-11,0], yes.\n\nAt Δt=4: min=-29+24=-5 ≤0, max=-18+24=6 ≥0, 0 in [-5,6], yes.\n\nΔt=3: T=45, min=-29+18=-11, max=-18+18=0\n\nΔt=4: T=46, min=-29+24=-5, max=-18+24=6\n\nBoth cover 0.\n\nNow freeway 7: same car as freeway 6? \"(-18,-29,right,6)\" identical.\n\nSo occupied at T=45 and T=46.\n\nNow freeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst: (-18,-29,right,6) same as above.\n\nSecond: (48,37,right,6)\n\nHead=48, tail=37, direction right.\n\nτ = tail =37, h=head=48? But 37<48, so span [τ,h] = [37,48]\n\nAt T: [37 + 6 Δt, 48 + 6 Δt]\n\n0 in span: 37 + 6 Δt ≤ 0 ≤ 48 + 6 Δt\n\nBut 37 + 6 Δt ≥37>0 for Δt≥0, so min>0, never covers 0.\n\nSimilarly, max>0.\n\nSo this car never covers x=0.\n\nNow the first car on freeway 8: (-18,-29,right,6) same as freeway 6 and 7.\n\nSpan at T: [-29 + 6 Δt, -18 + 6 Δt]\n\nAs before, 0 covered when Δt=3 or 4, T=45 or 46.\n\nSince second car never covers 0, so freeway 8 occupied only by first car at T=45 and T=46.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, times when x=0 is occupied (unsafe):\n\nFreeway 1: occupied at T=44\n\nFreeway 2: occupied at T=44\n\nFreeway 3: occupied at T=43,46\n\nFreeway 4: occupied at T=43,46\n\nFreeway 5: occupied at T=43,46\n\nFreeway 6: occupied at T=45,46\n\nFreeway 7: occupied at T=45,46\n\nFreeway 8: occupied at T=45,46\n\nFor other times, these freeways are safe at x=0.\n\nNow, player starts at turn T=42, y=2.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some turn, say T_end.\n\nMinimal H, so we want to reach as soon as possible.\n\nSince we start at y=2, and need y=9, difference of 7, so minimum 7 turns if we go up every turn.\n\nBut we have to avoid being on a freeway when it is occupied.\n\nAt each turn, when we are on y, if y between 1 and 8, we must not be there when occupied.\n\nAlso, we can stay or move up or down.\n\ny must be in [0,9].\n\nStart at T=42, y=2.\n\nFreeway 2 is occupied only at T=44, so at T=42, y=2 is safe? At T=42, for freeway 2, is it occupied?\n\nFrom above, freeway 2 occupied only at T=44, so at T=42, it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=43, etc.\n\nLet me list for each freeway and each turn around, the safety.\n\nTurns from 42 to, say, 50.\n\nFor each y from 1 to 8, and turn T, whether (x=0) is occupied.\n\nSince x=0 is fixed, we care about the freeway state at each turn.\n\nDefine safe for player to be on y at T if y=0 or y=9, or if 1≤y≤8 and no car covers x=0 on freeway y at T.\n\nFrom above:\n\nFreeway 1: unsafe at T=44, safe otherwise.\n\nFreeway 2: unsafe at T=44, safe otherwise.\n\nFreeway 3: unsafe at T=43 and T=46, safe otherwise.\n\nFreeway 4: same, unsafe at T=43,46.\n\nFreeway 5: same, unsafe at T=43,46.\n\nFreeway 6: unsafe at T=45,46, safe otherwise.\n\nFreeway 7: unsafe at T=45,46, safe otherwise.\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at T=45,46, safe otherwise.\n\nNow, player at T=42, y=2.\n\nWe need to plan a sequence of actions: U, D, or S, changing y accordingly.\n\ny_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with Δy_t = +1 for U, -1 for D, 0 for S.\n\nAnd y must be integer in [0,9].\n\nStart: T=42, y=2\n\nTarget: some T, y=9.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at T_end, with minimal T_end - 42 + 1? H is the number of turns, from t=0 to H-1 relative to start.\n\nLet’s set T_start = t1 = 42.\n\nWe need to find H and actions for t from 0 to H-1, where t is offset, so turn T = t1 + t.\n\nAt turn T = t1 + t, player position y_{t1 + t}.\n\nAt t=0, T=42, y=2.\n\nAfter H turns, at turn t1 + H - 1, y should be 9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, then at turn 42, y should be 9, but start at 2, impossible.\n\nH=2: at turn 43, y=9? But from y=2 to y=9 in one action? Action changes to next turn, so from T=42 to T=43, y changes based on action at T=42.\n\nAt turn T, we perform action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThe sequence is actions from t1 to t1 + H - 1, and after H actions, at turn (t1 + H - 1) + 1? Let's clarify.\n\nThe turn when we are at position: at the beginning of turn T, we are at y_T, then we choose action a_T, then we move to y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy for the next turn.\n\nBut the collision is checked at the beginning of the turn, when we are at y_T.\n\nThe problem says: \"at turn T\", player is at (0, y_T), and collision occurs if for y_T, 0 in span at T.\n\nThen we choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1 + H - 1, and after these H actions, at turn t1 + H, we are at y_{t1 + H}, but we need to be at (0,9) at some turn, which is when we are at that position.\n\nThe target is to reach (0,9), meaning at turn T, y_T =9 for some T.\n\nAnd we need the minimal H such that after H actions starting from t1, we are at y=9 at turn t1 + H.\n\nStart at turn t1, position y_{t1}.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn t1, y_{t1}.\n\nAfter 1 action, at turn t1+1, y_{t1+1}.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t1 + H, y_{t1 + H}.\n\nWe need y_{t1 + H} =9 for some H.\n\nAnd H is the number of actions (turns we act).\n\nThe sequence of actions is from turn t1 to turn t1 + H - 1, total H actions.\n\nAnd at turn t1 + H, we are at position after the last action.\n\nWe need y_{t1 + H} =9.\n\nFor example, start at T=42, y=2.\n\nIf we do nothing, H=0, we are at y=2, not 9.\n\nIf we do action at T=42, to go to y=3 at T=43, etc.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at some future turn.\n\nMinimal H means minimal number of actions to reach y=9.\n\nSince each action can change y by at most 1, to go from 2 to 9, we need at least 7 actions, each increasing y by 1, so H=7, reaching at T=42+7=49.\n\nBut with obstacles, it might take more if we have to wait or detour.\n\nNow, back to the safety.\n\nAt each turn T, for each y, we can see if it is safe to be there.\n\nBut y changes based on actions.\n\nWe need a path in time and y.\n\nStart: T=42, y=2.\n\nSafe, since freeway 2 safe at T=42.\n\nWe can choose to go up, down, or stay.\n\nIf we go up, to y=3 at T=43.\n\nBut at T=43, y=3, freeway 3 is unsafe at T=43 (occupied).\n\nIf we stay, y=2 at T=43.\n\nAt T=43, freeway 2 is safe (only unsafe at T=44).\n\nFreeway 2 unsafe only at T=44, so at T=43, y=2 is safe.\n\nIf we go down, to y=1 at T=43, but y=1 is freeway 1, which is safe at T=43 (only unsafe at T=44).\n\nSimilarly, y=0 is always safe.\n\nNow, let's list possible (T,y) states, with T starting from 42.\n\ny from 0 to 9.\n\nFor each, whether it is safe to be there at that turn.\n\nSafe if y=0 or y=9, always.\n\nFor y=1 to 8, safe except when occupied as above.\n\nSo:\n\nFor T=42:\n\ny=0: safe\n\ny=1: freeway1, safe (not T=44)\n\ny=2: safe\n\ny=3: freeway3, safe (not T=43 or 46? T=42 not unsafe, so safe)\n\ny=4: safe\n\ny=5: safe\n\ny=6: safe\n\ny=7: safe\n\ny=8: safe\n\ny=9: safe\n\nBut player is at y=2, so possible actions from here.\n\nNow T=43:\n\ny=0: safe\n\ny=1: freeway1, safe (T=43 not 44)\n\ny=2: freeway2, safe (T=43 not 44)\n\ny=3: freeway3, unsafe!

T=44, freeway3 safe, yes.\n\nBut at T=43, we are at y=2.\n\nOptions at T=43: from y=2, we can:\n\n- U: to y=3 at T=44\n\n- D: to y=1 at T=44\n\n- S: to y=2 at T=44\n\nBut at T=44, y=1 and y=2 are both unsafe, only y=3 to y=8 and 0,9 are safe, but y=0 and y=9 possible but not helpful yet.\n\nAt T=44, safe y: from earlier, y=3,4,5,6,7,8,9 safe; y=0,1,2 unsafe.\n\nSo from T=43, y=2, if we go U to y=3 at T=44, that is safe.\n\nIf we go D to y=1 at T=44, unsafe.\n\nIf we go S to y=2 at T=44, unsafe.\n\nSo only possible action at T=43 is U, to y=3 at T=44.\n\nBut we are at T=42 now.\n\nBack to T=42.\n\nAt T=42, y=2, we can:\n\n- U: to y=3 at T=43 → but at T=43, y=3 unsafe, collision. Not possible.\n\n- D: to y=1 at T=43 → at T=43, y=1: freeway1, safe at T=43, since only unsafe at T=44. So y=1 at T=43 is safe.\n\n- S: to y=2 at T=43 → safe, as above.\n\nSo possible actions at T=42: D or S, not U.\n\nIf we choose D: to y=1 at T=43.\n\nThen at T=43, y=1, safe.\n\nNow at T=43, y=1, we choose action.\n\nPossible: U, D, S.\n\nIf U: to y=2 at T=44 → but at T=44, y=2 unsafe.\n\nIf D: to y=0 at T=44 → y=0 safe.\n\nIf S: to y=1 at T=44 → unsafe.\n\nSo only possible: D to y=0 at T=44.\n\nThen at T=44, y=0, safe.\n\nNow at T=44, y=0, we choose action.\n\nWe can go U to y=1 at T=45.\n\nAt T=45, y=1: freeway1, safe (not occupied).\n\nOr stay at y=0, but not helpful.\n\nOr down, but y=0, cannot go down, y min 0, I assume we cannot go below, so actions: if y=0, D might not be allowed? The dynamics: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy, and y in [0,9], so if y=0, D would make y=-1, not allowed, so probably we cannot choose D when y=0. Similarly, at y=9, cannot choose U.\n\nSo at y=0, only U or S.\n\nSimilarly, at y=9, only D or S.\n\nSo at T=44, y=0, actions: U or S.\n\nIf S: stay at y=0 at T=45.\n\nIf U: to y=1 at T=45.\n\nNow at T=45, y=1 is safe, as above.\n\nBut we need to go up.\n\nNow, let's see if we can reach y=9 quickly.\n\nSince we are at y=0 at T=44, we should go up.\n\nBut let's see the unsafe spots later.\n\nAt T=45, y=6,7,8 unsafe.\n\ny=1,2,3,4,5 safe at T=45.\n\nAt T=46, many unsafe.\n\nNow, back to the start.\n\nAnother option at T=42: instead of going down, we can stay.\n\nAt T=42, S: to y=2 at T=43.\n\nThen at T=43, y=2, safe, and as before, only possible action is U to y=3 at T=44.\n\nThen at T=44, y=3, safe.\n\nNow, from here, we can go up.\n\nBut at T=45, y=6,7,8 unsafe, so we need to avoid being on those at T=45.\n\nSimilarly, at T=46, many unsafe.\n\nLet's list the path we have so far.\n\nFirst path: go down at T=42.\n\nT=42: action D, to y=1 at T=43\n\nT=43: at y=1, action D, to y=0 at T=44\n\nT=44: at y=0, action U, to y=1 at T=45\n\nNow at T=45, y=1, safe.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nFrom y=1, we can go up.\n\nBut at T=45, y=6,7,8 unsafe, so if we go up fast, we might reach y=6 or higher at T=45? Let's see timing.\n\nCurrent at T=45, y=1.\n\nIf we go up every turn:\n\nT=45: y=1, action U, to y=2 at T=46\n\nBut at T=46, y=2 is safe? T=46, freeway2: from earlier, freeway2 unsafe only at T=44, so at T=46, safe.\n\nBut at T=46, y=3,4,5,6,7,8 are unsafe except y=1 and y=2 and y=9.\n\ny=1,2,9 safe at T=46; others unsafe.\n\nSo if at T=45, y=1, action U to y=2 at T=46, which is safe.\n\nThen at T=46, y=2, we can action U to y=3 at T=47? But at T=46, y=3 unsafe, cannot.\n\nAction S to y=2 at T=47, but y=2 at T=47 safe.\n\nOr action D to y=1 at T=47.\n\nBut we need to go up.\n\nAt T=46, from y=2, possible actions:\n\nU to y=3 at T=47? But the action at T=46 determines y_{T=47}.\n\nAt turn T=46, we are at y=46, choose action, go to y_{47}.\n\ny_{47} = y_{46} + Δy.\n\nAt T=46, we are at y=2, safe.\n\nWe can choose:\n\nU: to y=3 at T=47\n\nD: to y=1 at T=47\n\nS: to y=2 at T=47\n\nAll these positions at T=47 are safe, since T=47 all safe.\n\nSo we can go U to y=3 at T=47.\n\nThen continue up.\n\nBut let's see the sequence.\n\nFirst, from the down path:\n\nT=42: D to y=1 at T=43\n\nT=43: D to y=0 at T=44\n\nT=44: U to y=1 at T=45\n\nT=45: at y=1, we can U to y=2 at T=46\n\nT=46: at y=2, U to y=3 at T=47\n\nT=47: at y=3, U to y=4 at T=48\n\nT=48: U to y=5 at T=49\n\nT=49: U to y=6 at T=50\n\nT=50: U to y=7 at T=51\n\nT=51: U to y=8 at T=52\n\nT=52: U to y=9 at T=53\n\nBut we reach y=9 at T=53, which is turn 53, so H = T - t1 = 53 - 42 = 11? Let's see the number of actions.\n\nStart at T=42, after H actions, at T=42 + H.\n\nWe need y_{42 + H} =9.\n\nHere, at T=53, y=9, so 42 + H =53, H=11.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nNow, the other path: stay at start.\n\nT=42: S to y=2 at T=43\n\nT=43: U to y=3 at T=44  (only choice)\n\nT=44: at y=3, safe.\n\nNow from here, we can go up.\n\nBut at T=45, y=6,7,8 unsafe, so we need not to be on y=6,7,8 at T=45.\n\nAt T=44, y=3.\n\nWe can choose action at T=44.\n\nOptions: U, D, S.\n\nIf U: to y=4 at T=45\n\nBut at T=45, y=4 is safe? T=45, y=4: freeway4, safe at T=45 (only unsafe at T=43,46? T=45 not unsafe, so safe)\n\nSimilarly, y=5 safe at T=45.\n\ny=6 unsafe at T=45.\n\nSo from T=44, y=3:\n\n- U to y=4 at T=45: safe\n\n- D to y=2 at T=45: y=2 safe at T=45\n\n- S to y=3 at T=45: y=3 safe at T=45\n\nAll possible, but we want to go up.\n\nSuppose we go U to y=4 at T=45.\n\nThen at T=45, y=4, safe.\n\nNow, we need to avoid T=46 unsafe y.\n\nAt T=46, y=3 to 8 unsafe, only y=0,1,2,9 safe.\n\nBut we are at y=4 at T=45.\n\nFrom here, if we go U to y=5 at T=46, but at T=46 y=5 unsafe.\n\nIf we go D to y=3 at T=46, unsafe.\n\nIf we go S to y=4 at T=46, unsafe.\n\nNo possible action to safe position at T=46? But we have to be somewhere.\n\nAt T=45, y=4, we must choose an action to go to y at T=46.\n\nBut at T=46, all y from 3 to 8 are unsafe, y=0,1,2,9 safe.\n\nFrom y=4, we can go to y=3,4,5 at T=46, all of which are unsafe except if we go to y=2 or something, but from y=4, D to y=3, U to y=5, S to y=4, none of which are safe at T=46.\n\nWe cannot go directly to y=2 or y=1 from y=4 in one step; we can only change by 1.\n\nSo from y=4, at T=45, we can only reach y=3,4,5 at T=46, all unsafe.\n\nTherefore, we cannot be at y=4 at T=45, because it leads to inevitable collision at T=46.\n\nSimilarly, if at T=44 we go to y=5 at T=45.\n\nAt T=45, y=5 safe.\n\nThen at T=45, from y=5, actions to y=4,5,6 at T=46.\n\ny=4,5,6 all unsafe at T=46.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 at T=45 is unsafe anyway.\n\nIf at T=44 we go S to y=3 at T=45.\n\nThen at T=45, y=3, safe.\n\nThen actions to y=2,3,4 at T=46.\n\ny=2 safe at T=46, y=3 and 4 unsafe.\n\nSo we can go D to y=2 at T=46, which is safe.\n\nThen from there, proceed.\n\nSimilarly, if at T=44 we go D to y=2 at T=45.\n\nAt T=45, y=2 safe, then we can go to y=1,2,3 at T=46.\n\ny=1 and 2 safe at T=46, y=3 unsafe.\n\nSo we can go S to y=2 or D to y=1 at T=46.\n\nNow, back to the path.\n\nFrom start, if we do S at T=42, then U at T=43 to y=3 at T=44.\n\nThen at T=44, y=3.\n\nTo avoid being at y=4 or 5 at T=45, we should not go up to those at T=45.\n\nInstead, we can go down or stay to reach a safe y for T=46.\n\nFor example:\n\nAt T=44, y=3, choose D to y=2 at T=45.\n\nThen at T=45, y=2, safe.\n\nThen at T=45, we can choose to go to y=1,2, or 3 at T=46.\n\ny=1 and 2 safe at T=46, y=3 unsafe.\n\nSo we can go D to y=1 at T=46, or S to y=2 at T=46.\n\nSay go S to y=2 at T=46.\n\nThen at T=46, y=2, safe.\n\nThen at T=46, we can go U to y=3 at T=47, since T=47 all safe.\n\nThen from there go up to 9.\n\nBut let's see the turns.\n\nStart T=42, y=2\n\nT=42: S, to y=2 at T=43? Action at T=42 to y at T=43.\n\nT=42: S, so y=2 at T=43\n\nT=43: U, to y=3 at T=44\n\nT=44: D, to y=2 at T=45\n\nT=45: S, to y=2 at T=46? Or other.\n\nAt T=45, y=2, we can go U to y=3 at T=46, but y=3 unsafe at T=46.\n\nCannot.\n\nGo D to y=1 at T=46, safe.\n\nOr S to y=2 at T=46, safe.\n\nSay S to y=2 at T=46.\n\nThen T=46: y=2, action U to y=3 at T=47\n\nT=47: y=3, U to y=4 at T=48\n\n...\n\nUp to y=9.\n\nReach y=9 at T=53? Let's count.\n\nT=42: start y=2\n\nAfter action T=42: y=2 at T=43? Positions:\n\nTurn T=42: y=2, perform action a_42\n\nThen y_{43} = y_42 + Δy_42\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSequence:\n\n- At T=42: y=2, action S (Δy=0), so y_{43} = 2\n\n- At T=43: y=2, action U (Δy=+1), so y_{44} = 3\n\n- At T=44: y=3, action D (Δy=-1), so y_{45} = 2\n\n- At T=45: y=2, action S (Δy=0), so y_{46} = 2\n\n- At T=46: y=2, action U (Δy=+1), so y_{47} = 3\n\n- At T=47: y=3, action U, y_{48} =4\n\n- T=48: U, y_{49}=5\n\n- T=49: U, y_{50}=6\n\n- T=50: U, y_{51}=7\n\n- T=51: U, y_{52}=8\n\n- T=52: U, y_{53}=9\n\nSo at T=53, y=9, H=11 actions from T=42 to T=52, 11 actions? Actions at turns: a_{42} to a_{52}, that's 11 actions, T=42 to T=52, and position after last action at T=53.\n\nNumber of actions: from turn t1 to t1+H-1, H actions, reach at t1+H.\n\nt1=42, t1+H=53, H=11.\n\nBut earlier with down path also H=11.\n\nWe can do better.\n\nNotice that at T=45, if we are at lower y, we can go up faster later.\n\nBut we have to pass through the unsafe zones.\n\nAnother idea: since at T=46 only y=1,2,9 are safe, and y=9 is far, we can be at y=1 or 2 at T=46.\n\nThen after that, all safe.\n\nSo we need to be at y=1 or 2 at T=46.\n\nThen from there, go up to 9 in 7 turns, reach at T=46 + 7 = 53, same as before.\n\nT=46 to T=53, 7 turns to increase from 2 to 9.\n\nBut if we start from y=2 at T=42, we can reach y=2 at T=46 with fewer actions.\n\nFor example, from T=42 to T=46, we need to be at y=2 at T=46.\n\nCurrent at T=42 y=2.\n\nWe can stay or move.\n\nBut we have constraints at T=43,44,45.\n\nAt T=43, we cannot be at y=3,4,5.\n\nAt T=44, cannot be at y=1,2.\n\nAt T=45, cannot be at y=6,7,8.\n\nWe start at T=42 y=2.\n\nAt T=43, we can be at y=2 (by S at T=42) or y=1 (by D at T=42) or y=0? But y=0 by D then down, but let's see.\n\nIf at T=42, we do S, to y=2 at T=43.\n\nThen at T=43, we must do U to y=3 at T=44, because other actions lead to unsafe at T=44.\n\nThen at T=44, y=3.\n\nNow at T=44, we can do D to y=2 at T=45, or S to y=3 at T=45, or U to y=4 at T=45.\n\nBut if we go to y=4 or 5 at T=45, we get stuck for T=46.\n\nSo better to go to y=2 at T=45.\n\nThen at T=45, y=2, we can go to y=1,2,3 at T=46.\n\nFor T=46, y=1 or 2 safe.\n\nSo we can go to y=2 at T=46 by S, or to y=1 by D.\n\nThen from T=46 y=2, we go up each turn to y=9 at T=53.\n\nH still 11.\n\nFrom T=42, if we do D at T=42 to y=1 at T=43.\n\nThen at T=43, we do D to y=0 at T=44.\n\nThen at T=44, y=0, do U to y=1 at T=45.\n\nAt T=45, y=1, we can do U to y=2 at T=46.\n\nAt T=46, y=2, then U to y=3 at T=47, etc to y=9 at T=53.\n\nSame.\n\nBut at T=45, from y=1, we could go U to y=2 at T=46, or directly to higher, but at T=45, if we go U twice? No, one action per turn.\n\nAt T=45, y=1, action U to y=2 at T=46.\n\nThen at T=46, y=2, action U to y=3 at T=47.\n\nNo faster.\n\nUnless we can be at higher y earlier.\n\nBut at T=45, y=5 is safe, for example, but then at T=46 it is unsafe, and we can only go to y=4,5,6, all unsafe.\n\nSo we cannot be at y=4 or 5 at T=45 because we can't escape T=46 collision.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 at T=45 is safe, and we can go to y=2 at T=46, which is safe.\n\ny=2 at T=45, go to y=2 or y=1 at T=46.\n\ny=1 at T=45, go to y=1 or y=2 at T=46.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut the key is that from T=47 onwards, all clear, so to reach y=9, from y=2 at T=46, it takes 7 turns: T=46 to T=53.\n\nMinimum time to reach y=9 is T=49 if no obstacles, but with obstacles, we have to spend turns avoiding.\n\nCan we reach y=9 before T=53?\n\nFor example, if we can be at y=9 at T=49, but T=49 is after T=46, and at T=49, all safe, so possible if we can get to a high y by T=46.\n\nBut at T=46, we can only be at y=1 or 2 or 9.\n\ny=9 at T=46 is possible only if we are already at y=9 or close, but we are at lower y.\n\nFrom T=42 to T=46, only 4 turns, we start at y=2, to reach y=9 in 4 turns, we need to increase by 7, impossible, since max +4 if all up, but y=2+4=6 at T=46, but y=6 at T=46 is unsafe, and we can't reach y=9.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=9 before T=47 or later.\n\nEarliest possible: at T=47, we can be at y=3, for example, then to y=9 in 6 turns, reach T=53.\n\nAt T=47 y=3, U to y=4 T=48, U to y=5 T=49, U to y=6 T=50, U to y=7 T=51, U to y=8 T=52, U to y=9 T=53.\n\n6 actions from T=47 to T=52, reach at T=53.\n\nIf we can be at higher y at T=47.\n\nFor example, if at T=46 we are at y=2, then at T=47 y=3.\n\nCan we be at y=4 at T=47?\n\nFrom where? At T=46, we can only be at y=1 or 2, so at T=47, y=2 or 3.\n\nMax y=3 at T=47.\n\nSimilarly, if we are at y=1 at T=46, then at T=47 y=2.\n\nSo at T=47, we can be at y=2 or 3.\n\nThen to y=9, need 6 or 7 more turns, so reach at T=53 or 54.\n\nBut with y=3 at T=47, reach y=9 at T=53.\n\nWith y=2 at T=47, reach at T=54, later.\n\nSo better to be at y=3 at T=47.\n\nNow, how to get to y=3 at T=47 with minimal actions from start.\n\nFrom T=42 to T=47, 5 turns.\n\nStart y=2 at T=42.\n\nEnd y=3 at T=47.\n\nNet increase +1, so we can have some down or stay moves.\n\nBut we need to avoid the unsafe points.\n\nOne way is the path we had: T=42 S to y=2 T=43, T=43 U to y=3 T=44, T=44 D to y=2 T=45, T=45 S to y=2 T=46, T=46 U to y=3 T=47.\n\nActions: S,U,D,S,U — 5 actions to reach y=3 at T=47.\n\nThen from T=47 U to y=4 T=48, U to y=5 T=49, ..., U to y=9 T=53.\n\n6 actions from T=47 to T=52.\n\nTotal actions from T=42 to T=52: 11 actions, reach at T=53.\n\nThe actions: a42 to a52, 11 actions.\n\nBut a42 to a52 is turns 42 to 52, 11 turns, position at T=53.\n\nH=11.\n\nIn the down path: T=42 D to y=1 T=43, T=43 D to y=0 T=44, T=44 U to y=1 T=45, T=45 U to y=2 T=46, T=46 U to y=3 T=47, then same as above.\n\nAlso 5 actions to y=3 at T=47.\n\nThen same.\n\nBut at T=45, from y=1, we can go directly to higher if possible, but we can't because of T=46.\n\nAnother idea: at T=44, from y=3, instead of going down to y=2 at T=45, can we go up to y=4 at T=45? But then at T=45 y=4 safe, but at T=46 we are stuck.\n\nUnless we can jump to y=9 or something, but no.\n\nPerhaps stay at lower y until after T=46.\n\nFor example, at T=44, y=3, we can go S to y=3 at T=45.\n\nThen at T=45 y=3, safe.\n\nThen at T=45, we must go to a safe y at T=46, which are y=1 or 2 or 9.\n\nFrom y=3, we can go D to y=2 at T=46, safe.\n\nThen at T=46 y=2, then U to y=3 T=47, etc.\n\nSame as before.\n\nIf we go to y=1 at T=46, from y=3 at T=45, D to y=2 or directly? D to y=2 at T=46, or from y=3, D to y=2.\n\nCannot go directly to y=1.\n\nFrom y=3, D to y=2 at T=46.\n\nThen same.\n\nSo no better.\n\nBut at T=46, y=9 is safe, but we are at low y, can't reach.\n\nSo minimal H is 11.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach earlier.\n\nSuppose we go up at some point.\n\nFor example, at T=42, we cannot go up because T=43 y=3 unsafe.\n\nAt T=43, from y=2, we go U to y=3 at T=44.\n\nThen at T=44, y=3, we go U to y=4 at T=45.\n\nAt T=45, y=4, safe, but then at T=45, we need to go to T=46.\n\nBut y=4 at T=45, to y=3,4,5 at T=46, all unsafe.\n\nNo escape.\n\nIf at T=44, we go to y=5 at T=45, same issue.\n\nSo impossible to be at y=4 or 5 at T=45.\n\nSimilarly, if we are at y=6 at T=45, but y=6 unsafe at T=45, so we can't be there anyway.\n\nSo the only safe states at T=45 are y=0,1,2,3,4,5, but y=3,4,5 can go to unsafe at T=46, while y=0,1,2 can go to safe y at T=46.\n\ny=0 at T=45: can go to y=0 or y=1 at T=46.\n\ny=0 and y=1 safe at T=46.\n\ny=1 at T=45: go to y=0,1,2 at T=46, all safe.\n\ny=2 at T=45: go to y=1,2,3 at T=46; y=1 and 2 safe, y=3 unsafe, so can go to y=1 or 2.\n\ny=3 at T=45: go to y=2,3,4 at T=46; y=2 safe, y=3 and 4 unsafe, so can go to y=2.\n\ny=4 at T=45: go to y=3,4,5 at T=46, all unsafe, no safe move.\n\nSimilarly y=5.\n\nSo to be safe, at T=45 we must be at y=0,1,2, or 3 (but from y=3 only if we go down to y=2 at T=46).\n\nNow, back to the sequence.\n\nWe can have a shorter path if we can reach y=9 faster after T=46.\n\nBut since at T=47 we can be at y=3, it takes 6 turns to y=9.\n\nFrom y=3 to y=9, 6 steps: y=3 to4,4 to5,5 to6,6 to7,7 to8,8 to9, so 6 actions, from T=47 to T=52, y at T=53.\n\nCan we be at y=4 at T=47?\n\nAt T=47, y=4 is safe, but how to get there.\n\nAt T=46, we are at y=1 or 2.\n\nIf y=2 at T=46, we can go U to y=3 at T=47.\n\nIf y=1, go U to y=2 at T=47.\n\nSo at T=47, we can be at y=2 or 3, not 4.\n\nSo y=4 at T=47 impossible.\n\nThus, earliest to reach y=9 is T=53 with H=11.\n\nBut let's see if we can be at y=9 at T=49 or something.\n\nAt T=49, all safe, but to be at y=9, we need to have y=2 at T=42, increase by 7, so minimum T=49 if all up, but with obstacles, we have to delay.\n\nFor example, from T=42 to T=43, we cannot go up, so we lose a turn.\n\nSimilarly, at other points.\n\nIn the path, we have to spend turns to avoid the unsafe times.\n\nSo H=11 seems necessary.\n\nPerhaps a different route.\n\nAnother idea: go down to y=0 and stay, but that would take more turns.\n\nOr, at T=45, if we are at y=1, we can go up to y=2 at T=46, etc.\n\nNo faster.\n\nSince at T=46, y=9 is safe, if we can be at y=9 at T=46.\n\nBut from y=2 at T=42 to y=9 at T=46, 4 turns, increase by 7, impossible.\n\nMax y at T=46 is, from T=42: if all up, y=2 at T=42, U to3 T43, but T43 y=3 unsafe, cannot.\n\nIf we go down first, y lower.\n\nSo impossible to be at high y at T=46.\n\nThus, minimal H is 11.\n\nNow, for the sequence, we can choose one.\n\nFor example, the first path with down:\n\nActions:\n\nTurn t1=42: D  (to y=1 at T=43)\n\nTurn t1+1=43: D  (to y=0 at T=44)\n\nTurn t1+2=44: U  (to y=1 at T=45)\n\nTurn t1+3=45: U  (to y=2 at T=46)\n\nTurn t1+4=46: U  (to y=3 at T=47)\n\nTurn t1+5=47: U  (to y=4 at T=48)\n\nTurn t1+6=48: U  (to y=5 at T=49)\n\nTurn t1+7=49: U  (to y=6 at T=50)\n\nTurn t1+8=50: U  (to y=7 at T=51)\n\nTurn t1+9=51: U  (to y=8 at T=52)\n\nTurn t1+10=52: U  (to y=9 at T=53)\n\nH=11 actions, from t=0 to 10.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, H=11.\n\nIn the sequence, actions from turn t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nSo turn 42 to 52.\n\nReach at T=53.\n\nWith the stay path:\n\nTurn 42: S\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: D\n\nTurn 45: S  (to y=2 at T=46)\n\nTurn 46: U  (to y=3 at T=47)\n\nThen same up from there.\n\nIn this case, at T=45, we did S to y=2 at T=46.\n\nWe could do D to y=1 at T=46, but then at T=47 y=2, which is lower, so reach y=9 later, worse.\n\nSo better to be at higher y.\n\nNow, but in the output, we need the sequence for the minimal H.\n\nBut is there a way with H=10?\n\nSuppose reach y=9 at T=52.\n\nThen at T=52, y=9.\n\ny_{52} =9.\n\nThen at T=51, y must be 8 or 9, and action at T=51 to reach y=9 at T=52.\n\nSimilarly, at T=51, if y=8, action U.\n\nOr y=9, action S or D, but D not to 9.\n\nTo reach y=9 at T=52, at T=51, y must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y=9 at T=51, then action S to y=9 at T=52.\n\nBut we start from y=2, so y=9 at T=51 requires increase by 7 from T=42, but T=51 - 42 =9 turns, possible if all up, but with obstacles.\n\ny at T=51.\n\nT=51 is after T=46, all safe.\n\nBut from start to T=51, 9 turns.\n\nStart y=2 at T=42.\n\nAfter 9 actions, at T=51.\n\nIf all up, y=2+9=11, but y max 9, so we can reach earlier, but with obstacles, we may have down or stay.\n\nTo reach y=9 at T=51, we need to have increased by 7 in 9 turns, so possible with 2 extra moves, like stay or down.\n\nBut the issue is the early turns.\n\nFor example, from T=42 to T=43, we cannot go up, so we must do S or D.\n\nSuppose we do S at T=42, to y=2 at T=43.\n\nThen at T=43, U to y=3 at T=44.\n\nThen at T=44, we need to go to a safe state.\n\nIf we go D to y=2 at T=45.\n\nThen at T=45, y=2.\n\nNow, from T=45 y=2, we can start going up.\n\nBut at T=46, we need to be at safe y, y=1 or 2.\n\nSo at T=45 y=2, we can go S to y=2 at T=46, or D to y=1 at T=46.\n\nSay S to y=2 at T=46.\n\nThen from T=46 y=2, we can go U each turn to y=9.\n\nT=46: y=2, U to y=3 T=47\n\nT=47: U to y=4 T=48\n\nT=48: U to y=5 T=49\n\nT=49: U to y=6 T=50\n\nT=50: U to y=7 T=51\n\nT=51: U to y=8 T=52\n\nT=52: U to y=9 T=53\n\nStill T=53.\n\nIf at T=45, from y=2, we go U to y=3 at T=46, but y=3 unsafe at T=46, cannot.\n\nSo must stay or down at T=45 for T=46.\n\nThus, cannot go up at T=45.\n\nSo the sequence is fixed to have y=2 or 1 at T=46.\n\nThen up from T=47.\n\nReach at T=53.\n\nWith H=11.\n\nPerhaps from T=44, if we go to y=3 at T=45, then at T=45 go D to y=2 at T=46, same.\n\nNo better.\n\nSo minimal H=11.\n\nNow for the sequence, I think any of the paths work.\n\nLet's use the one without going to y=0.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn 42: S\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: D\n\nTurn 45: S  (to stay at y=2 for T=46)\n\nAt T=45, action S, to y=2 at T=46.\n\nThen:\n\nTurn 46: U  (to y=3 at T=47)\n\nTurn 47: U  (to y=4 at T=48)\n\nTurn 48: U  (to y=5 at T=49)\n\nTurn 49: U  (to y=6 at T=50)\n\nTurn 50: U  (to y=7 at T=51)\n\nTurn 51: U  (to y=8 at T=52)\n\nTurn 52: U  (to y=9 at T=53)\n\nNow, H=11 actions: from turn 42 to 52.\n\nIn the sequence above, actions from turn 42 to 52, 11 actions.\n\nIn the answer, we need to list the actions for each turn.\n\nt1=42.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 42: S\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: D\n\nTurn 45: S\n\nTurn 46: U\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nAnd at turn 53, y=9.\n\nBut we need to specify the turn numbers.\n\nIn the format: Turn t1: a_{t1}, etc.\n\nt1=42.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 42: S\n\nTurn 43: U\n\nTurn 44: D\n\nTurn 45: S\n\nTurn 46: U\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nH=11.\n\nBut let's confirm the positions:\n\nT=42: y=2, action S → y=2 at T=43\n\nT=43: y=2, action U → y=3 at T=44\n\nT=44: y=3, action D → y=2 at T=45\n\nT=45: y=2, action S → y=2 at T=46\n\nT=46: y=2, action U → y=3 at T=47\n\nT=47: y=3, action U → y=4 at T=48\n\n...\n\nUp to T=52: action U, y=9 at T=53.\n\nAll safe: at T=43 y=2 safe, T=44 y=3 safe, T=45 y=2 safe, T=46 y=2 safe, T=47 y=3 safe, etc.\n\nAnd we avoided the unsafe points.\n\nWith the down path also works.\n\nBut in this sequence, we didn't go to y=0 or y=1, so perhaps better.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence\"\n\nI think H=11 is minimal.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach earlier with a different sequence.\n\nSuppose at T=42, D to y=1 at T=43\n\nT=43, instead of D, we can do S? At T=43 y=1, action S to y=1 at T=44.\n\nBut at T=44, y=1 unsafe, cannot.\n\nMust do D to y=0 at T=44.\n\nThen same as before.\n\nAt T=45, from y=1, if we do U to y=2 at T=46, same.\n\nNo.\n\nSo I think H=11 is the minimum.\n\nThus, the sequence.\n\nIn the output format.\n\nAlso, for freeway 8, there was a car (48,37,right,6), but we saw it never covers 0, so no issue.\n\nSimilarly others.\n\nSo I think this is fine.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 42\\) is 11. The sequence of actions avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\) by considering the car positions and their movements over time.\n\n### Summary of Unsafe Freeway Times:\n- Freeway 1: Unsafe at \\(T = 44\\)\n- Freeway 2: Unsafe at \\(T = 44\\)\n- Freeway 3: Unsafe at \\(T = 43\\) and \\(T = 46\\)\n- Freeway 4: Unsafe at \\(T = 43\\) and \\(T = 46\\)\n- Freeway 5: Unsafe at \\(T = 43\\) and \\(T = 46\\)\n- Freeway 6: Unsafe at \\(T = 45\\) and \\(T = 46\\)\n- Freeway 7: Unsafe at \\(T = 45\\) and \\(T = 46\\)\n- Freeway 8: Unsafe at \\(T = 45\\) and \\(T = 46\\)\n\nAll freeways are safe at other times, and \\(y = 0\\) and \\(y = 9\\) are always safe.\n\n### Optimal Path and Actions:\nThe sequence starts at turn \\(t_1 = 42\\) with \\(y = 2\\). The actions are chosen to:\n- Avoid \\(y = 3, 4, 5\\) at \\(T = 43\\) (unsafe).\n- Avoid \\(y = 1, 2\\) at \\(T = 44\\) (unsafe).\n- Avoid \\(y = 6, 7, 8\\) at \\(T = 45\\) (unsafe).\n- Avoid \\(y = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\\) at \\(T = 46\\) (unsafe), except \\(y = 1, 2, 9\\).\n\nThe path reaches \\(y = 2\\) at \\(T = 46\\), then proceeds upward from \\(T = 47\\) when all freeways are safe. The actions ensure the player is only on safe positions at each turn.\n\n### Action Sequence:\n- **Turn 42:** Action \\(S\\) (stay) → Position at \\(T = 43\\): \\(y = 2\\) (safe, freeway 2 safe at \\(T = 43\\)).\n- **Turn 43:** Action \\(U\\) (up) → Position at \\(T = 44\\): \\(y = 3\\) (safe, freeway 3 safe at \\(T = 44\\)).\n- **Turn 44:** Action \\(D\\) (down) → Position at \\(T = 45\\): \\(y = 2\\) (safe, freeway 2 safe at \\(T = 45\\)).\n- **Turn 45:** Action \\(S\\) (stay) → Position at \\(T = 46\\): \\(y = 2\\) (safe, freeway 2 safe at \\(T = 46\\)).\n- **Turn 46:** Action \\(U\\) (up) → Position at \\(T = 47\\): \\(y = 3\\) (safe, all freeways safe at \\(T = 47\\)).\n- **Turn 47:** Action \\(U\\) (up) → Position at \\(T = 48\\): \\(y = 4\\).\n- **Turn 48:** Action \\(U\\) (up) → Position at \\(T = 49\\): \\(y = 5\\).\n- **Turn 49:** Action \\(U\\) (up) → Position at \\(T = 50\\): \\(y = 6\\).\n- **Turn 50:** Action \\(U\\) (up) → Position at \\(T = 51\\): \\(y = 7\\).\n- **Turn 51:** Action \\(U\\) (up) → Position at \\(T = 52\\): \\(y = 8\\).\n- **Turn 52:** Action \\(U\\) (up) → Position at \\(T = 53\\): \\(y = 9\\).\n\nAt \\(T = 53\\), the player reaches \\((0, 9)\\). The number of actions \\(H = 11\\) (from turn 42 to turn 52) is minimal, as any fewer turns would either violate collision constraints or fail to reach \\(y = 9\\) due to the obstacles and the need to increase \\(y\\) by 7.\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 42: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 43: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 44: \\text{ D} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 45: \\text{ S} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 46: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 47: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 48: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 49: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 50: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 51: \\text{ U} \\\\ \\text{Turn } 52: \\text{ U} \\end{array} }",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 3) at turn t_1 = 44. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimum number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing the y-position by +1, -1, or 0, respectively, and y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nCars move on specific freeways, and for each, I'm given their positions at turn t_1=44. I need to find where they are at future turns to avoid collisions.\n\nCollision happens if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y, and for that freeway, 0 is within the span of any car on that freeway at that turn T.\n\nThe note says that when you move, you're not on the new freeway until the next turn. So if you move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T you're still on y, and at turn T+1 you're on y+1. So for collision, at turn T, we care about the freeway y_T that the player is on at that turn.\n\nThe player position at turn t is y_t. At turn T, if y_T = k for some k=1 to 8, then we need that 0 is not in the span of any car on freeway k at turn T.\n\nThe span is given for turn t_1, and I need to compute it for turn T.\n\nLet me denote Δt = T - t_1, so for a future turn, Δt is the number of turns after t_1.\n\nFor a car with direction and speed, the span changes linearly.\n\nFirst, for left-moving cars: direction left means they're moving left, so the head and tail both decrease by s per turn.\n\nSimilarly, right-moving increase by s per turn.\n\nIn the span, for left-moving, it's given as (h, τ) with h > τ I assume? Let me see the values.\n\nFor freeway 1: (-24, 11, left, 36). -24 and 11, since it's left-moving, and h=-24, τ=11? But -24 < 11, so head is at -24, tail at 11? That doesn't make sense because if it's moving left, the head should be on the right, I think there's inconsistency in notation.\n\nLet me read carefully.\n\nFor left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s (T-t_1), τ - s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nAnd in the table, for freeway 1: (-24, 11, left, 36)\n\nIf h = -24, τ = 11, and it's left-moving, then at T, [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt]\n\nBut h = -24, which is less than τ=11, so [h, τ] = [-24, 11] which is from left to right, but since it's moving left, the car is shifting left.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nAnd in the table, for example, freeway 3: (48, 37, right, 12), so here it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed), but for right-moving, it says [τ, h] in the span, which might be confusing.\n\nLet's clarify the notation.\n\nFrom the car update:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] , and it moves to [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt]\n\nIn the input, for freeway 1: (-24, 11, left, 36), so I think h is head, τ is tail.\n\nBut in [h, τ], if h = -24, τ = 11, since -24 < 11, [h, τ] = [-24, 11] means from -24 to 11, so the car occupies x from -24 to 11.\n\nSince it's left-moving, at time T, it will be at [h - sΔt, τ - sΔt] = [-24 -36Δt, 11 -36Δt]\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h], and for freeway 3: (48, 37, right, 12), but (48,37), so head=48, tail=37? But 48>37, so if [τ, h] = [37,48], which is from 37 to 48, and it moves to [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt] = [37 +12Δt, 48 +12Δt]\n\nIn the span notation, [τ, h] for right-moving, but in the input it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed), so for right-moving, head is larger number, tail smaller, I assume.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, in freeway 1, head=-24, tail=11, both integers, and since it's left-moving, head should be the left end or right end? I think there's ambiguity.\n\nLet's think physically.\n\nTypically, for a car moving left, the front is to the left if we think of x-axis, but in terms of position, if x increases to the right, then moving left means decreasing x.\n\nIn the span, it's given as [h, τ], but which is head and tail?\n\nTo avoid confusion, I should look at the values.\n\nFor freeway 1, left-moving, h=-24, τ=11, so at t_1, span is from min(h,τ) to max(h,τ)? But -24 and 11, min is -24, max is 11, so the car is from x=-24 to x=11.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, freeway 3, (48,37, right,12), 48 and 37, min 37, max 48, so from 37 to 48.\n\nBut in the right-moving description, it says [τ, h] for the span, with τ and h, but in input it's (head, tail), so for consistency, I think we should interpret the span as the interval from left to right, so for any car, the span is [min, max] at t_1, and then it moves.\n\nFor left-moving, since moving left, both ends decrease.\n\nFor right-moving, both increase.\n\nIn the collision condition, we care about whether 0 is in the span at turn T.\n\nAlso, for each freeway, there might be multiple cars, so I need to check for each car on that freeway.\n\nNow, the player starts at y=3 at turn 44.\n\nI need to go to y=9.\n\nEach move changes y by at most 1, so minimum turns to move from y=3 to y=9 is 6 turns if I only go up, but I might need to avoid cars, so I might need to stay or go down sometimes, which could increase turns, but since I want minimal H, I should avoid unnecessary moves, so ideally move up as much as possible, but avoid collisions.\n\nH is the number of turns, from t=0 to H-1, so if I start at turn t_1, after H turns, I am at turn t_1 + H -1, and y should be 9 at that turn.\n\nLet's clarify the sequence.\n\nAt turn t_1, I am at position y_{t_1} =3.\n\nI take action a_{t_1}, which affects y_{t_1 +1}.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1, where t is the index from start.\n\nIn the problem: \"sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and \"y_{t_1 + H -1} =9\"\n\nSo at time t_1, I take action a_{t_1}, which determines y_{t_1 +1} = y_{t_1} + Δy_{t_1}\n\nThen at time t_1 +1, I take a_{t_1 +1}, and so on, up to action at t_1 + (H-1), and after that action, at time t_1 + H, y is set, but we care about y at turn t_1 + H -1? Let's see.\n\nThe position after H actions: after action a_{t_1}, at turn t_1+1, y is updated.\n\nThen after action a_{t_1 + H-1}, at turn (t_1 + H-1) +1 = t_1 + H, y is updated.\n\nBut we want y_{t_1 + H -1} =9, which is the position at turn t_1 + H -1.\n\nTurn t_1 + H -1 is the turn when we have just taken action a_{t_1 + H-2} or something? I'm getting confused with indices.\n\nLet me define the turn number.\n\nAt turn T, the player is at position y_T.\n\nAt turn T, we choose action a_T, which determines the next position y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nThen at turn T+1, we are at y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nStart at turn T_start = t_1 = 44, y_44 = 3.\n\nWe take a sequence of actions: a_{44}, a_{45}, ..., up to some a_{44 + K}, and after taking a_{44+K}, at turn 45 + K, y is set to some value.\n\nWe want that at some turn T_end, y_{T_end} =9.\n\nAnd T_end = 44 + H -1, since we start from t=0 to H-1, t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1, so actions from t_1 to t_1 + H-1.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + H-1}, at turn (t_1 + H-1) +1 = t_1 + H, y is set.\n\nBut we want y at turn t_1 + H -1 to be 9.\n\ny_{t_1 + H -1} =9.\n\nThat means at turn t_1 + H -1, before taking any action, we are at y=9.\n\nThen, since we are at (0,9), and it's the goal, we don't need to take further actions, I think.\n\nThe sequence has H actions, from a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H-1}, and after these actions, at turn t_1 + H, y might be different, but we care that at turn t_1 + H -1, y=9.\n\nSo at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at (0,9), and we have taken H-1 actions? Let's index properly.\n\nLet t be the turn number.\n\nAt turn t, position y_t.\n\nAction a_t is taken at turn t, affecting y_{t+1}.\n\nAt turn t_1 =44, y_44 =3.\n\nWe take a_44, which sets y_45 = y_44 + Δy_44.\n\nThen at turn 45, we take a_45, setting y_46, and so on.\n\nWe want that for some T, y_T =9, with T = t_1 + H -1 = 44 + H -1.\n\nAnd we take actions from a_44 to a_{44 + H -2} to reach y_{44 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor example, if H=1, then T=44 +1 -1=44, so we want y_44=9, but it's 3, so not possible, H at least 6 since from 3 to 9, min 6 up moves.\n\nWith H actions, we can change y by at most H, from 3 to 3+H, but since we need to be at 9, and y capped at 9, the minimal H is at least 6.\n\nNow, at turn T when we are at y_T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, we need to ensure no collision on that freeway at that turn.\n\nIf y_T=0 or 9, no freeway, so no collision possible.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\nCars only on y=1 to 8.\n\nSo at turn T, if y_T = k for k=1 to 8, then for freeway k, at turn T, 0 must not be in any car's span.\n\nOtherwise, collision.\n\nThe note about moving: when we move, at the turn we move, we are still on the old freeway.\n\nFor example, if at turn T, we are at y_T = k, and we take action U, then y_{T+1} = k+1.\n\nAt turn T, we are on freeway k, so we check cars on k at turn T.\n\nAt turn T+1, we are on freeway k+1, so we check cars on k+1 at turn T+1.\n\nSo no issue with the transition.\n\nNow, to find the minimal H and the action sequence.\n\nFirst, list all cars and their movements.\n\nt_1 = 44.\n\nFor each freeway, the cars are given.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (h, τ, d, s) = (-24, 11, left, 36)\n\nSince left-moving, span at time t: [h - s(t - t_1), τ - s(t - t_1)] = [-24 -36(t-44), 11 -36(t-44)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1? (-24, 11, left, 36) also, so identical.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12)\n\nAll right-moving.\n\nFor right-moving, span at t: [τ + s(t-t_1), h + s(t-t_1)] for each car.\n\nIn the notation, for right-moving, it says [τ, h] at t_1, then [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt] at t.\n\nIn input, (head, tail), so for (48,37,right,12), head=48, tail=37, so at t_1, span [τ, h] = [37,48], I think it's [min, max] but 37 to 48.\n\nSimilarly, (12,1,right,12), [1,12]? tail=1, head=12, so [1,12]\n\nAnd (-24,-35,right,12), head=-24, tail=-35, so tail=-35, head=-24, so [τ, h] = [-35, -24]? But since right-moving, [τ + sΔt, h + sΔt] = [-35 +12(t-44), -24 +12(t-44)]\n\nSimilarly, freeway 4: same as freeway 3? \" (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12) \" identical to freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 5: same as 3 and 4.\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (-6,-17,right,6)\n\nSo (h,t,d,s) = (-6,-17,right,6), so tail=-17, head=-6? Since right-moving, [τ, h] = [-17, -6] at t_1, then at t: [-17 +6(t-44), -6 +6(t-44)]\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway 6? \"(-6,-17,right,6)\" identical.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: (-6,-17,right,6) and (60,49,right,6)\n\nFirst car: same as above, (-6,-17,right,6), span at t: [-17 +6(t-44), -6 +6(t-44)]\n\nSecond car: (60,49,right,6), so tail=49, head=60, [49,60] at t_1, at t: [49 +6(t-44), 60 +6(t-44)]\n\nNow, we need to find when 0 is in the span for each freeway at various turns.\n\nSince the player moves vertically, we need to simulate the path and for each turn, if y_t between 1 and 8, check if at that turn, for that freeway, 0 is occupied.\n\nTo find minimal H, we should aim for the shortest path, so mostly up, but avoid turns where collision would occur.\n\nStart at turn 44, y=3.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 at turn T=44 + H -1.\n\nSet T_start = 44.\n\nLet k = y_t for turn t.\n\nFor each freeway, we can find for which turns 0 is occupied.\n\nSince the cars move continuously, we can find the times when 0 is covered.\n\nBut turns are discrete, so for each freeway, find for which t, 0 is in some car's span on that freeway.\n\nFirst, freeway 1: cars: one car with span at t: [-24 -36(t-44), 11 -36(t-44)]\n\n0 in span if -24 -36(Δt) <= 0 <= 11 -36(Δt) for Δt = t-44\n\nSimilarly, for freeway 2, same as freeway 1, so same times when 0 occupied.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars.\n\nFirst car: (48,37,right,12), span at t: [37 +12(Δt), 48 +12(Δt)] where Δt = t-44\n\n0 in span if 37 +12Δt <= 0 <= 48 +12Δt? But 37 +12Δt is always positive for t>=44, since 37>0, so 0 < 37 +12Δt, so 0 not in [37+12Δt, 48+12Δt] for any t, since min is at least 37 at t=44, and increasing.\n\nSimilarly, second car: (12,1,right,12), span [1 +12(Δt), 12 +12(Δt)] at t\n\n1+12Δt >=1 >0, so 0 not in [1+12Δt, 12+12Δt]\n\nThird car: (-24,-35,right,12), span at t: [-35 +12(Δt), -24 +12(Δt)]\n\n0 in span if -35 +12Δt <= 0 <= -24 +12Δt\n\nSo -35 +12Δt <= 0 and 0 <= -24 +12Δt\n\nFrom -35 +12Δt <= 0 => 12Δt <= 35 => Δt <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916, so Δt <= 2 since integer\n\nFrom 0 <= -24 +12Δt => 12Δt >= 24 => Δt >= 2\n\nSo for Δt=2, both: at Δt=2, -35 +24 = -11 <=0, and -24+24=0 <=0, so 0 <=0, so 0 is included.\n\nAt Δt=2, t=46, -35 +12*2 = -35+24= -11 <=0, and -24+24=0 <=0, so 0 in [-11,0], yes.\n\nAt Δt=1, t=45, -35+12= -23, -24+12= -12, so [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nAt Δt=3, t=47, -35+36=1, -24+36=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 3, only at t=46, 0 is occupied by the third car.\n\nBut freeway 3 has multiple cars, but only this one can have 0 in span at some point.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 4 and 5, same as freeway 3, so at t=46, 0 occupied on freeways 3,4,5.\n\nFreeway 4 and 5 have the same cars as freeway 3, so yes.\n\nNow freeway 6: one car (-6,-17,right,6), span at t: [-17 +6(Δt), -6 +6(Δt)]\n\n0 in span if -17 +6Δt <= 0 <= -6 +6Δt\n\nSo -17 +6Δt <= 0 => 6Δt <=17 => Δt <= 17/6 ≈2.833, so Δt <=2\n\nAnd 0 <= -6 +6Δt => 6Δt >=6 => Δt >=1\n\nSo for Δt=1: -17+6= -11, -6+6=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\nΔt=2: -17+12= -5, -6+12=6, [-5,6], 0 included.\n\nΔt=0: -17, -6, [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nΔt=3: -17+18=1, -6+18=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 6, 0 occupied at t=45 and t=46 (Δt=1 and 2)\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7 same as 6, so at t=45 and 46, 0 occupied.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: same as above, (-6,-17,right,6), so at t, [-17+6Δt, -6+6Δt], so 0 occupied when Δt=1 or 2, as above.\n\nSecond car: (60,49,right,6), span [49 +6Δt, 60 +6Δt], min 49>0, so 0 never in span.\n\nSo for freeway 8, 0 occupied only when first car has it, at t=45 and 46.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, the turns where 0 is occupied (thus collision if player is on that freeway at that turn):\n\nFreeway 1: from earlier, 0 in span when -24 -36Δt <= 0 <= 11 -36Δt\n\nLeft: -24 -36Δt <= 0 => -36Δt <= 24 => Δt >= -24/36 = -2/3, always true for t>=44\n\nRight: 0 <= 11 -36Δt => 36Δt <=11 => Δt <= 11/36 ≈0.305, so Δt <=0, i.e., only at t=44 if, but at Δt=0, t=44, span [-24,11], -24<=0<=11, yes 0 in span.\n\nAt Δt=1, t=45, [-24-36,11-36]=[-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for t>44, more negative, so only at t=44, 0 occupied on freeway 1.\n\nSimilarly freeway 2 same, only at t=44.\n\nFreeway 3: only at t=46, as above.\n\nFreeway 4: same as 3, only t=46.\n\nFreeway 5: same, only t=46.\n\nFreeway 6: at t=45 and t=46.\n\nFreeway 7: same, t=45 and 46.\n\nFreeway 8: at t=45 and 46.\n\nNow, player starts at turn 44, y=3.\n\nAt turn 44, if y=3, which is freeway 3? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=3 is freeway 3.\n\nAt turn 44, on freeway 3, is 0 occupied? From above, freeway 3 has 0 occupied only at t=46, not at t=44, so at t=44, freeway 3 is safe? Let me confirm.\n\nFreeway 3 at t=44: cars: first [37,48], 0 not in; second [1,12], 0 not in; third [-35,-24], 0 not in. So yes, no car covers 0 at t=44, so safe.\n\nBut freeway 1 and 2 have 0 occupied at t=44.\n\nBut player is on y=3, not on y=1 or 2, so no collision at t=44.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\nMinimal turns: if no cars, we can go UUUUUU, from y=3 to y=9 in 6 moves: actions at t=44 to 49, y at t=45 to 50: y45=4, y46=5, y47=6, y48=7, y49=8, y50=9. So at turn 50, y=9.\n\nT_start=44, we want y_T=9 with T=44+H-1.\n\nAfter H actions, y at turn 44+H.\n\nSet y_{44+H} =9, but we want y_{44+H-1}=9.\n\nFor example, with 6 actions: actions at 44,45,46,47,48,49.\n\nAfter action at 49, at turn 50, y=9.\n\nBut we want y at turn 44+H-1=9.\n\nWith H actions, actions from 44 to 44+H-1.\n\nAfter action a_{44+H-1}, at turn 45+H-1, y is set.\n\nWe want y_{44+H-1} =9.\n\nSo at turn 44+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nFor instance, if H=6, we want y_{44+6-1}=y_{49}=9.\n\nIn the sequence: at turn 44, y=3.\n\nTake a44, set y45.\n\nAt turn 45, y45.\n\nTake a45, set y46.\n\n...\n\nTake a48, set y49.\n\nWe want y49=9.\n\nSo actions from a44 to a48, that's 5 actions? Let's count.\n\nActions: a44, a45, a46, a47, a48: that's 5 actions, H=5.\n\nThen y45, y46, y47, y48, y49.\n\nStart y44=3.\n\nAfter a44, y45 = y44 + Δy44.\n\nIf we go up each time, y45=4, y46=5, y47=6, y48=7, y49=8? y49=8, not 9.\n\ny49=8 if we start from y44=3 and go up 5 times: from turn 44 to 49, 5 steps, y increases by up to 5, to 8.\n\nTo reach y49=9, we need 6 increases, so actions from a44 to a49, H=6 actions, then y45 to y50, with y50=9.\n\nBut we want y_{44+H-1}=9.\n\nFor H=6, 44+H-1=49, y49=9.\n\ny49 is at turn 49, after action a48? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn t, before action, position y_t.\n\nAction a_t taken, sets y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at turn t, we have y_t, then take a_t, then y_{t+1} is set.\n\nThe position at turn t is y_t.\n\nWe want for some T, y_T =9.\n\nT = t1 + H -1 = 44 + H -1.\n\nFor example, to have y49=9, T=49, so 44 + H -1 =49, so H-1=5, H=6.\n\nActions from a44 to a49? a44 to a49 is 6 actions: a44,a45,a46,a47,a48,a49.\n\nAfter a44, y45 set.\n\nAfter a45, y46 set.\n\n...\n\nAfter a48, y49 set.\n\nAfter a49, y50 set.\n\nWe want y49=9, so after a48, y49=9.\n\nActions a44 to a48 determine y45 to y49.\n\nWith a44 to a48, 5 actions, H=5, then T=44+5-1=48, y48=9? No.\n\nT = t1 + H -1\n\nH actions: t from 0 to H-1, actions at t1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo for t=0, action at t1 +0 = t1\n\nt=1, action at t1+1\n\n...\n\nt=H-1, action at t1 + H-1\n\nAfter action at t1 + H-1, at turn (t1 + H-1) +1 = t1 + H, y is set.\n\nBut we care about y at turn t1 + H -1, before any action that turn.\n\nAt turn t1 + H -1, we have y_{t1 + H -1}, and we may take an action, but the position at that turn is y_{t1 + H -1}.\n\nWe want that to be 9.\n\nIn terms of reaching, with y starting at 3, to be at 9 at turn T, the number of turns from 44 to T is T-44.\n\nSince each turn we can stay or move, the minimal turns to go from 3 to 9 is 6 turns, meaning from turn 44 to turn 50, y50=9, but we want y49=9, which is earlier.\n\nTo have y49=9, from y44=3, we need to increase by 6 in 5 steps? From turn 44 to 49, there are 5 actions that change y.\n\nLet's think of the number of steps.\n\nFrom turn 44 to turn 45: one action, can change y by -1,0,+1.\n\nSimilarly to turn 46, another action, etc.\n\nThe position at turn T is determined by the actions from turn 44 to turn T-1.\n\nFor y_T, it is set by actions from 44 to T-1.\n\nSpecifically, y_T = y44 + sum_{k=44}^{T-1} Δy_k\n\nWe want y_T =9 for some T.\n\nMinimal T such that we can reach y_T=9 without collision.\n\nSince we start at y44=3, and we can move up, the earliest T is when we go up as fast as possible.\n\nIf we go U every turn, y45=4, y46=5, y47=6, y48=7, y49=8, y50=9.\n\nSo y50=9 at turn 50.\n\ny49=8 at turn 49.\n\nTo have y49=9, we must have been at y48=8 or 9, but if y48=8, and we go U, y49=9; if y48=9, we go S or D, but we want y49=9, so if y48=9, go S, y49=9; if y48=8, go U, y49=9.\n\nBut to have y48=8 or 9, from y44=3, in 4 actions, we can be at most y48=7 if all U, since 3+4=7.\n\nActions from a44 to a47 affect y45 to y48.\n\ny48 = y44 + Δy44 + Δy45 + Δy46 + Δy47\n\nMax y48 = 3 +4 =7 if all U.\n\nThen at turn 48, y48=7.\n\nThen to have y49=9, we need to go from 7 to 9 in one action, impossible, max +1 to 8.\n\nSo y49 cannot be 9, because from y44=3, after 5 actions (a44 to a48), we set y45 to y49, with y49 = 3 + sum_{k=44}^{48} Δy_k, sum of 5 terms, each -1,0,1, so y49 <= 3+5=8, so y49 <=8, cannot be 9.\n\nSimilarly, y48 <= 3+4=7, etc.\n\nThe earliest turn to be at y=9 is turn 50, with y50=9, after 6 up moves from turn 44.\n\nWith actions a44 to a49, all U, y45=4, y46=5, y47=6, y48=7, y49=8, y50=9.\n\nAnd we want y_T=9 with T=44+H-1.\n\nSet 44+H-1 =50, so H-1=6, H=7.\n\nT=50, 44+H-1=50, H-1=6, H=7.\n\nActions from a44 to a50? a44 to a50 is 7 actions.\n\nBut to reach y50=9, we need actions up to a49.\n\nLet's list:\n\nTurn 44: y44=3, take a44, set y45\n\nTurn 45: y45, take a45, set y46\n\n...\n\nTurn 49: y49, take a49, set y50\n\nWe want y50=9, so we take actions a44 to a49 to set y45 to y50.\n\nWith all U, y45=4, y46=5, y47=6, y48=7, y49=8, y50=9.\n\nSo at turn 50, y=9.\n\nFor y_T=9 with T=50, so t1 + H -1 =50, 44 + H -1=50, H-1=6, H=7 actions: a44 to a50? a44 to a50 is 7 actions, but a50 is taken at turn 50, setting y51, which we don't care.\n\nThe sequence is actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1 + H-1}, so for H actions, at times t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nFor y_T=9 with T=50, T= t1 + H -1 =44 + H -1=50, so H-1=6, H=7.\n\nActions: a44, a45, a46, a47, a48, a49, a50.\n\nBut a44 sets y45, a45 sets y46, ..., a49 sets y50, a50 sets y51.\n\nSince we want y50=9, it is set by a49, so we need a49, but a50 is not necessary, but the sequence includes up to a_{t1+H-1}=a50 for H=7.\n\nBut after a50, y51 is set, but we don't care, as long as at turn 50, y50=9.\n\nIn the sequence, for H=7, we have actions up to a50, but a50 is not used for reaching y50, it might change y51, but since we only care about reaching y50=9, we can choose a50 arbitrarily, say S.\n\nBut to minimize H, we want the smallest H such that we can reach y_T=9 for T=44+H-1.\n\nThe minimal T for y_T=9 is 50, with T=50, so 44+H-1=50, H=7.\n\nWith H=6, T=44+6-1=49, y49<=8, cannot be 9.\n\nSo minimal possible H is 7, with T=50.\n\nNow, we need to reach y50=9 without collision during the path.\n\nThat is, for each turn from 44 to 49, when we are at y_t, if y_t between 1 and 8, no collision on that freeway at that turn.\n\ny_t for t=44 to 49.\n\nIn the sequence to y50=9, we have y45 to y50 set, but y_t for t=44 to 49 are the positions during the path.\n\nSpecifically, at turn 44, y44=3\n\nTurn 45, y45\n\n...\n\nTurn 49, y49\n\nTurn 50, y50=9\n\nFor collision, at each turn t, if y_t in {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, then we need that at turn t, for freeway y_t, 0 is not occupied by any car.\n\nIf y_t=0 or 9, no collision possible.\n\ny50=9, safe.\n\nNow, we start at t=44, y44=3, freeway 3.\n\nAt t=44, freeway 3: as earlier, no car covers 0, so safe.\n\nThen we need to go to y=9 by t=50.\n\nWith minimal turns, we want to go up as much as possible.\n\nBut we need to avoid being on a freeway when it is occupied at that turn.\n\nList the dangerous turns for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: occupied only at t=44\n\nFreeway 2: same, only t=44\n\nFreeway 3: occupied only at t=46\n\nFreeway 4: same, only t=46\n\nFreeway 5: same, only t=46\n\nFreeway 6: occupied at t=45 and t=46\n\nFreeway 7: same, t=45 and 46\n\nFreeway 8: occupied at t=45 and 46\n\nNow, the path: we start at t=44, y=3 (freeway 3, safe as above)\n\nAt t=45, y45 could be 2,3,4 depending on action.\n\nSimilarly, we need to set y_t for t=45 to 49 such that at each turn, if y_t in 1-8, it is safe for that freeway at that turn.\n\nThen y50=9.\n\nSince we want min H, and H=7 is fixed for reaching y50=9, we need to find a sequence that avoids collision.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nBut D might be bad as it moves away from goal, so probably not necessary, but sometimes to avoid, we might stay or even go down.\n\nBut let's see the critical points.\n\nThe dangerous times are around t=45,46 for freeways 6,7,8, and t=46 for 3,4,5.\n\nSpecifically, at t=46, freeways 3,4,5,6,7,8 are all occupied except if y_t not on them.\n\nFreeway 1 and 2 occupied only at t=44, but at t=44 we are on y=3, not 1 or 2, so safe.\n\nNow at t=46, many freeways are occupied.\n\nTo avoid collision at t=46, we need that at turn 46, y46 is not on freeways 3,4,5,6,7,8, or be on one that is not occupied, but all of 3-8 are occupied at t=46 except possibly some, but from above:\n\nAt t=46:\n\nFreeway 3: occupied\n\n4: occupied\n\n5: occupied\n\n6: occupied\n\n7: occupied\n\n8: occupied\n\nAll freeways from 3 to 8 have 0 occupied at t=46.\n\nTherefore, at turn 46, if y46 is between 3 and 8 inclusive, there will be collision, because all those freeways are occupied.\n\ny46 could be 0,1,2,9 but 9 might not be reachable yet.\n\ny46 <= 3 + 2 = 5 if all U from t=44, but let's see.\n\nAt turn 46, y46 must not be in {3,4,5,6,7,8} to avoid collision.\n\nBut since freeways 1 to 8, if y46=1 or 2, freeway 1 or 2, which are not occupied at t=46, only at t=44.\n\nAt t=46, freeway 1: from earlier, only occupied at t=44, at t=46 Δt=2, span [-24-72,11-72]=[-96,-61], not covering 0.\n\nSimilarly freeway 2 same.\n\nFreeway 1 and 2 are safe at t=46.\n\nSimilarly, if y46=0 or 9, safe.\n\nBut y46=9 probably not possible, since from y44=3, after two actions, y46 <= 3+2=5.\n\nSimilarly, y46 >=1 probably, but could be 0 if we go down.\n\nBut going down might not be efficient.\n\nSo at turn 46, to avoid collision, y46 must be 0,1,2, or 9.\n\nBut y46=9 impossible from y44=3 in two steps.\n\ny46=0 possible if we go down twice, but then we are at 0, far from 9, and we need to reach 9 by turn 50, which might take more turns.\n\ny46=1 or 2 possible.\n\nNow, similarly, at other turns, there might be issues.\n\nFirst, let's list all turns where we need to check.\n\nWe need to ensure for each t from 44 to 49, when y_t is set, if y_t in 1-8, safe.\n\nt=44: y44=3, freeway 3, safe as above.\n\nt=45: y45, if in 1-8, need safe.\n\nFreeways occupied at t=45: from above, freeway 6,7,8 have 0 occupied at t=45.\n\nFreeway 1,2,3,4,5 not occupied at t=45.\n\nt=46: all freeways 3-8 occupied, freeway 1,2 not occupied.\n\nt=47: let's find for t=47.\n\nΔt=3.\n\nFreeway 1: span [-24-108,11-108]=[-132,-97], 0 not in.\n\nFreeway 2: same.\n\nFreeway 3: at t=47, Δt=3, cars: first [37+36,48+36]=[73,84], not; second [1+36,12+36]=[37,48], not; third [-35+36,-24+36]=[1,12], not 0. So freeway 3 safe at t=47.\n\nSimilarly freeway 4,5 same, safe.\n\nFreeway 6: at t=47, Δt=3, span [-17+18, -6+18]=[1,12], 0 not in, safe.\n\nFreeway 7 same, safe.\n\nFreeway 8: first car same, [1,12], not; second car [49+18,60+18]=[67,78], not. Safe.\n\nt=48: similarly, all should be safe, since cars moving away or not at 0.\n\nFreeway 1: even worse.\n\nFreeway 3: Δt=4, third car [-35+48,-24+48]=[13,24], not 0.\n\nOthers similar.\n\nt=49: same.\n\nSo only at t=45 and t=46 there are potential collisions, specifically:\n\nAt t=45, freeways 6,7,8 occupied.\n\nAt t=46, freeways 3,4,5,6,7,8 all occupied.\n\nNow back to the path.\n\nWe need to set y45, y46, y47, y48, y49 such that y50=9, and for each t, y_t safe.\n\ny50=9, which requires that from y49, we go U or S, so y49 must be 8 or 9.\n\nSimilarly, y48 must be 7,8,9 so that we can reach y49=8 or 9, etc.\n\nBut to minimize time, we want to go up.\n\nNow, constraints:\n\nAt t=45: if y45 is 6,7, or 8, then on freeway 6,7,8, which are occupied, so collision.\n\nTherefore, at t=45, y45 cannot be 6,7,8.\n\nSo y45 must be <=5 or >=9 or 0, but y45 >=9 impossible from y44=3 in one step (y45 <=4).\n\ny45 <= 3+1=4 if U, or 3 if S, or 2 if D.\n\nSo y45 can be 2,3,4.\n\nIf y45=2, freeway 2; y45=3, freeway 3; y45=4, freeway 4.\n\nNow at t=45, freeways occupied: 6,7,8.\n\nFreeway 2,3,4 not occupied at t=45, as per above.\n\nSo if y45=2,3, or4, all safe, since freeways 2,3,4 are safe at t=45.\n\nSimilarly, if y45=1, freeway 1, also safe; or y45=0 or 5, etc., but y45 max 4, min 2 if we go U or S or D, but D to 2 possible.\n\nBut y45=2,3,4 all safe at t=45.\n\nNow at t=46: we need y46 not in {3,4,5,6,7,8}, because all those freeways occupied.\n\nSo y46 must be 0,1,2, or 9.\n\nBut y46=9 impossible, since y45 <=4, y46 <=5.\n\ny46 <= y45 +1 <=5.\n\nSimilarly, y46 >= y45 -1.\n\nSo y46 can be from 1 to 5, since y45 >=2 probably, but if y45=2, y46=1,2,3; if y45=3, y46=2,3,4; if y45=4, y46=3,4,5.\n\nBut y46 must be 0,1,2 to be safe at t=46.\n\nSo y46 <=2.\n\nTherefore, y46 must be 1 or 2.\n\nNow, y46=1 or 2.\n\nFrom above, y45 must be such that y46 can be 1 or 2.\n\nIf y45=2, then y46 can be 1 (if D), 2 (if S), or 3 (if U)\n\nBut y46 must be 1 or 2, so if y45=2, we can go S or D to have y46=2 or 1.\n\nIf y45=3, y46 can be 2,3,4; to have y46=2, we need to go D.\n\nIf y45=4, y46 can be 3,4,5; to have y46=2, impossible, since min y46=3 if y45=4 and D, y46=3.\n\ny45=4, go D, y46=3; go S, y46=4; go U, y46=5.\n\nCannot get to y46=1 or 2 from y45=4.\n\nSimilarly, if y45=2, we can get y46=1 or 2.\n\nIf y45=3, we can get y46=2 (by D), or 3,4.\n\nBut y46 must be 1 or 2.\n\nTherefore, y45 cannot be 4, because from y45=4, y46 min 3, which is not <=2.\n\ny45=4 implies y46 >=3, but we need y46 <=2, impossible.\n\nTherefore, y45 cannot be 4.\n\nSimilarly, y45=3 is possible only if we go down to y46=2.\n\ny45=2 is possible, and we can go to y46=1 or 2.\n\nNow, at t=44, y44=3.\n\nWe take a44, which sets y45.\n\ny45 can be 2 (if D), 3 (if S), or 4 (if U).\n\nBut from above, y45 cannot be 4, because then y46 cannot be <=2.\n\ny45=4 not allowed.\n\nTherefore, at t=44, we cannot go U, because that would make y45=4, which forces y46>=3, but we need y46<=2.\n\nTherefore, at t=44, we must not go U; we must go S or D.\n\nIf go S, y45=3\n\nIf go D, y45=2\n\nNow, we also need to reach y50=9.\n\ny50=9 requires y49=8 or 9.\n\ny49=8 or 9.\n\nSimilarly, y48 must be 7,8,9 to reach that, etc.\n\nNow, from y46=1 or 2, we need to go up to y50=9.\n\nFrom y46 to y50, we have actions at t=46,47,48,49, setting y47,y48,y49,y50.\n\nFour actions to increase from y46 to 9.\n\ny46 min=1, max=2.\n\nIf y46=1, to y50=9, need +8 in 4 steps, impossible, max +4 to y50=5.\n\ny50 = y46 + Δy46 + Δy47 + Δy48 + Δy49\n\nEach Δy <=1, so y50 <= y46 +4\n\nIf y46=1, y50 <=5 <9\n\nIf y46=2, y50 <=6 <9\n\nCannot reach y50=9 from y46=1 or 2 in four steps.\n\ny46 <=2, y50 <= y46 +4 <=6 <9, impossible.\n\nBut earlier we need y46<=2 to avoid collision at t=46, but then we cannot reach y50=9.\n\nContradiction.\n\nTherefore, with the direct path, it is impossible to reach y50=9 without collision at t=46.\n\nWe need to arrive later or earlier, but earlier is not possible since y50 is minimal turn.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=9 earlier, but we saw y49 cannot be 9, so T=50 is earliest.\n\nMaybe we can reach y=9 at a later turn, but that would increase H, which we want to minimize.\n\nMinimal H is 7 for T=50, but if impossible, we need larger H.\n\nBut let's confirm if we can reach earlier.\n\ny49=9 impossible, as y49<=8.\n\ny48=9: y48 = y44 + Δy44 + Δy45 + Δy46 + Δy47 <=3+4=7<9, impossible.\n\nSimilarly, no earlier than turn 50.\n\nSo we must reach at turn 50.\n\nBut from above, to avoid t=46 collision, we need y46<=2, but then cannot reach y50=9.\n\nTherefore, we must have collision at some point? But we need to avoid.\n\nPerhaps at t=46, if we are on freeway 1 or 2, which are safe.\n\ny46=1 or 2 is possible, but then y50<=6.\n\nUnless we can be at higher y later.\n\nBut from y46=2, after four actions, y50<=6, cannot be 9.\n\ny50 = y46 + Δy46 + Δy47 + Δy48 + Δy49 <=2 +4=6.\n\nSimilarly, if we start from lower, worse.\n\nSo it seems impossible to reach y50=9 if we avoid t=46 by being low.\n\nTherefore, we cannot avoid the collision by being low at t=46; we need to be high, but at t=46, if y46=3 or more, collision.\n\nUnless we are not on freeway, but y=0 or 9, but y=0 at t=46: if we go down to y=0.\n\nAt t=44, y44=3.\n\nGo D, y45=2\n\nThen go D, y46=1\n\nOr from y45=2, go D, y46=1\n\ny46=1, freeway 1.\n\nAt t=46, freeway 1 is safe, as occupied only at t=44.\n\nThen from there, we need to go to y50=9.\n\nBut y46=1, to y50=9, need +8 in 4 steps, impossible, max y50=5.\n\nSimilarly, if y46=0, even worse.\n\ny46=0: from y44=3, go D to y45=2, then D to y46=1, or if y45=3, go D to y46=2, etc., but y46=0 only if from y45=1, go D, but y45 min 2, so y46 min 1.\n\nCannot be y46=0 from here.\n\ny46 min 1.\n\ny46=1, y50<=5.\n\nCannot reach 9.\n\nSo indeed, with H=7, it seems impossible to reach y50=9 while avoiding collision at t=46.\n\nBut we must reach at turn 50, so we need a different approach.\n\nPerhaps we can be on a freeway that is not occupied, but at t=46, all 3-8 are occupied, and 1-2 are safe, but we can't be on 1-2 and reach 9 in time.\n\nAnother idea: at t=46, if we are at y=9, but impossible.\n\nOr, we can delay the arrival.\n\nFor example, reach y=9 at a later turn, say turn 51 or 52, with larger H.\n\nBut H larger, not minimal.\n\nBut if H=7 impossible, we need H>7.\n\nLet's see what H we can achieve.\n\nFirst, minimal H for reaching y_T=9.\n\nFrom y44=3, to yT=9, the number of actions needed is at least 6, since each action can increase by at most 1.\n\nThe turn T = 44 + K, where K is the number of actions from turn 44 to turn T-1.\n\nyT = y44 + sum_{k=44}^{T-1} Δy_k\n\nWe want yT=9.\n\nMin T when we can have sum of 6 increases.\n\nWith 6 actions, we can reach y50=9.\n\nWith 5 actions, we can reach at most y49=8.\n\nSo minimal T is 50.\n\nIf we use more actions, T>50.\n\nFor example, if we use 7 actions, we can reach y51=9 or earlier if we move faster, but we can't, so y51=9 with 7 actions.\n\nActions from a44 to a50, setting y45 to y51.\n\nWith all U, y45=4, ..., y51=9.\n\nSimilarly, y50=8, etc.\n\nBut we want yT=9 at some T.\n\nFor T=50, y50=9 requires 6 up moves in the actions from 44 to 49.\n\nBut as above, we have conflict at t=46.\n\nNow for T=51, y51=9.\n\nThen T=51, t1 + H -1 =51, 44+H-1=51, H-1=7, H=8 actions.\n\nActions from a44 to a51.\n\nWe want y51=9.\n\nNow, the positions from t=44 to t=50 need to be safe.\n\ny51=9 is safe.\n\nAt turn 46, we can be low to avoid collision.\n\nFor example, at t=46, y46=1 or 2.\n\nThen from there, we can go up to y51=9.\n\ny51 = y46 + Δy46 + Δy47 + Δy48 + Δy49 + Δy50\n\nIf y46=2, then with 5 actions, y51 <=2+5=7<9, still not enough.\n\ny46=2, max y51=7.\n\nIf y46=1, max y51=6.\n\nCannot reach 9.\n\nTo reach y51=9 from y46, we need y46 such that y46 +5 >=9, so y46 >=4.\n\nBut at t=46, if y46>=3, collision.\n\nIf y46<=2, cannot reach y51=9.\n\nSame issue.\n\nFor later T.\n\nSuppose we reach at turn 52, y52=9.\n\nT=52, H from T=44+H-1=52, H-1=8, H=9 actions.\n\ny52 = y46 + Δy46 + ... + Δy51\n\n6 actions from 46 to 51.\n\nIf y46=2, y52 <=2+6=8<9.\n\ny46=1, y52<=7<9.\n\nStill not.\n\ny46 must be at least 3 to reach y52=9, but if y46=3, collision at t=46.\n\nUnless we can be at y46=3 but freeway not occupied, but it is occupied.\n\nPerhaps at t=46, if we are on freeway 3, but it is occupied, so collision.\n\nSo we must not be on freeway 3 to 8 at t=46.\n\nSo y46 must be <=2.\n\nThen to reach yT=9, we need enough turns after.\n\nSet y46=2.\n\nThen from there, to reach yT=9, we need T such that yT = 2 + sum of (T-46) terms of Δy, each <=1, so 2 + (T-46) >=9, so T-46 >=7, T>=53.\n\nSimilarly, if y46=1, T>=54.\n\nBut let's take y46=2.\n\nThen T>=53 for yT=9.\n\nT=53, y53=9.\n\nThen H from T=44+H-1=53, H-1=9, H=10 actions.\n\nActions from a44 to a53, but we need up to a52 to set y53.\n\nT=53, y53=9.\n\nActions from a44 to a52, 9 actions, H=9? Let's calculate.\n\nT = t1 + H -1 =44 + H -1 =53, so H-1=9, H=10.\n\nActions at t=44 to 44+10-1=53, a44 to a53.\n\nAfter a52, y53 set; after a53, y54 set.\n\nWe want y53=9, set by a52.\n\nNow, with y46=2, we can reach y53=9 with 7 steps from y46 to y53: actions a46 to a52, 7 actions, y47 to y53.\n\ny53 = y46 + sum_{k=46}^{52} Δy_k <=2 +7=9, equality if all U.\n\nSimilarly possible.\n\nNow, we need to avoid collision at all points.\n\nFirst, at t=46, y46=2, freeway 2.\n\nAt t=46, freeway 2 is not occupied, as per earlier, only at t=44, so safe.\n\nNow, we need to get to y46=2 from y44=3.\n\nWith actions at t=44 and t=45.\n\ny44=3.\n\nTake a44, set y45.\n\nThen take a45, set y46.\n\nWe need y46=2.\n\nAlso, at t=45, y45 must be safe.\n\ny45 can be 2,3,4 as before, but since we go to y46=2, possibilities:\n\nIf y45=2, then to have y46=2, go S; or to y46=1, go D, but we need y46=2, so go S.\n\nIf y45=3, go D to y46=2.\n\nIf y45=4, go D to y46=3, not 2.\n\nBut y45=4 not possible as before, but let's see.\n\nFrom y44=3, to have y46=2.\n\nOptions:\n\n- Go D at t=44, y45=2; then at t=45, go S, y46=2\n\n- Go S at t=44, y45=3; then go D at t=45, y46=2\n\n- Go U at t=44, y45=4; then go D at t=45, y46=3, not 2.\n\nBut we need y46=2, so only first two options.\n\nNow, at t=45, y45 must be safe.\n\nIf we go first option: a44=D, y45=2\n\ny45=2, freeway 2.\n\nAt t=45, freeway 2: is it occupied?\n\nFreeway 2 at t=45: Δt=1, span [-24-36,11-36]=[-60,-25], 0 not in, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, second option: a44=S, y45=3, freeway 3.\n\nAt t=45, freeway 3: not occupied, safe.\n\nThen a45=D, y46=2.\n\nBoth options are fine.\n\nNow, we need to go from y46=2 to y53=9 with all U, possible in 7 steps.\n\ny47=3, y48=4, y49=5, y50=6, y51=7, y52=8, y53=9.\n\nNow, check for collision during the path.\n\nt=46: y46=2, freeway 2, safe as above.\n\nt=47: y47=3, freeway 3.\n\nAt t=47, freeway 3: as earlier, not occupied, safe.\n\nt=48: y48=4, freeway 4.\n\nAt t=48, freeway 4: Δt=4, cars similar to freeway 3, all spans away from 0, safe.\n\nt=49: y49=5, freeway 5, similarly safe.\n\nt=50: y50=6, freeway 6.\n\nAt t=50, freeway 6: Δt=6, span [-17+36, -6+36]=[19,30], not 0, safe.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7,8 all safe at later turns.\n\nt=51: y51=7, freeway 7, safe.\n\nt=52: y52=8, freeway 8, safe.\n\nThen t=53: y53=9, safe.\n\nNow, we also have t=44 and t=45.\n\nt=44: y44=3, freeway 3, safe.\n\nt=45: depending on action.\n\nIf we took a44=D, y45=2, freeway 2, safe at t=45.\n\nIf a44=S, y45=3, freeway 3, safe at t=45.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, H=10, since T=53, 44+H-1=53, H=10.\n\nBut is this minimal?\n\nEarlier with H=7 impossible, H=8 or 9?\n\nFor example, can we reach at turn 51?\n\ny51=9.\n\nThen T=51, 44+H-1=51, H-1=7, H=8 actions.\n\nNow, to reach y51=9, from y44=3, need +6 in 7 actions?

At turn 53, we are at y53=9, we take a53, which sets y54, but we don't care.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to list actions from a44 to a53.\n\nBut for reaching, a53 doesn't affect y53, it affects later.\n\nIn the answer, we list the actions to be taken.\n\nNow, for the path, we have a44 and a45 to set the way to y46=2.\n\nThen a46 to a52 all U to increase to y53=9.\n\nThen a53 can be S, for example.\n\nNow, let's specify.\n\nI'll choose option 1: a44 = D, a45 = S\n\nThen a46 to a52 all U\n\na53 = S\n\nNow, check the positions:\n\nTurn 44: y44=3, take a44=D, so y45 = 3-1=2\n\nTurn 45: y45=2, take a45=S, so y46=2+0=2\n\nTurn 46: y46=2, take a46=U, y47=3\n\nTurn 47: y47=3, take a47=U, y48=4\n\nTurn 48: y48=4, take a48=U, y49=5\n\nTurn 49: y49=5, take a49=U, y50=6\n\nTurn 50: y50=6, take a50=U, y51=7\n\nTurn 51: y51=7, take a51=U, y52=8\n\nTurn 52: y52=8, take a52=U, y53=9\n\nTurn 53: y53=9, take a53=S, y54=9 (but not needed)\n\nAt turn 53, y53=9, which is what we want, since T=53.\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nt=44: y44=3, freeway 3, not occupied, safe.\n\nt=45: y45=2, freeway 2, not occupied at t=45, safe.\n\nt=46: y46=2, freeway 2, not occupied, safe.\n\nt=47: y47=3, freeway 3, not occupied, safe.\n\nt=48: y48=4, freeway 4, safe.\n\nt=49: y49=5, freeway 5, safe.\n\nt=50: y50=6, freeway 6, at t=50, safe as computed.\n\nSimilarly t=51: y51=7, freeway 7, safe.\n\nt=52: y52=8, freeway 8, safe.\n\nt=53: y53=9, safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nWith option 2: a44=S, a45=D, then same from a46 U.\n\na44=S, y45=3\n\na45=D, y46=2\n\nThen same as above.\n\nEither is fine.\n\nNow, H=10, but is there a shorter path?\n\nEarlier we thought not, but let's confirm.\n\nSuppose at t=46, we are at y=2, but we go up faster later, but we need to reach by turn 50, impossible.\n\nPerhaps avoid t=46 by being on safe freeway, but no, only 1 and 2 safe, but low.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus minimal H is 10.\n\nBut in the sequence, for the answer, we need to output the actions.\n\nAlso, in the car state, freeway 8 has two cars, but we handled.\n\nNow, output format.\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1} etc.\n\nt_1=44.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 44: D (if we choose option 1)\n\nThen Turn 45: S\n\nTurn 46: U\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: S\n\na53 is part of the sequence, but we can set it to S.\n\nSince we reach y53=9 at turn 53, and a53 is taken at turn 53, but it doesn't affect the position at turn 53.\n\nIn the sequence, we need to list actions from a44 to a53.\n\nIn the box.\n\nTo minimize H, but H=10 is the minimal possible given the constraints.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier if we skip some moves, but not possible.\n\nAnother thought: at t=45, if we are at y=5, but earlier y45 cannot be 5, since from y44=3, max y45=4.\n\ny45=4 possible only if U, but then y46 min=3, which causes collision at t=46 if we are on freeway.\n\nUnless at t=46, we are not on freeway, but y=0 not possible.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, H=10.\n\nNow for the answer.\n\nI think we should write the sequence.\n\nIn the sequence, for freeway 6,7,8, at t=45 they are occupied, but in our path, at t=45, we are at y=2 or 3, not on 6,7,8, so safe.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n</think>\nTo reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 44\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\), the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 10. This is determined by the need to avoid a collision at turn 46, where all freeways from \\(y = 3\\) to \\(y = 8\\) have a car covering position \\(x = 0\\). To avoid this, the player must be at \\(y = 1\\) or \\(y = 2\\) at turn 46, but this position is too low to reach \\(y = 9\\) by turn 50 or 52.

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn t1 = 45, and the player is at (0,2). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns, avoiding collisions.\n\nImportant: Collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway y_T (which is the row they are on at that turn) and at that same turn T, there is a car on that freeway such that 0 (the x-coordinate of the player) is in the car's span at turn T.\n\nNote: The player moves at the same time as the cars. When the player moves from y to y' at turn T, note:\n- At turn T, the player is on row y (the starting row) and then moves to row y' at the next state (turn T+1). Therefore, at turn T, the player is only on row y and will check for collisions with cars on row y at turn T.\n\nThe car update:\nFor a car at turn t1 (current turn) with head h, tail tau, direction d, speed s:\n- Left-moving (d = left): at time T (>= t1), the span is [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n- Right-moving (d = right): at time T, the span is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut note: for a right-moving car, the head is the larger coordinate? Actually, the table says for right-moving: at t1, the span is [tau, h] meaning that tau is the leftmost and h the rightmost? But then the update for right-moving: [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)] so that the entire car moves right by s per turn.\n\nSimilarly, left-moving: [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]: so the entire car moves left by s per turn.\n\nWe are given the state at turn t1=45.\n\nWe need to plan a sequence of actions (U, D, S) for turns 45, 46, ... until we reach y=9.\n\nConstraints on y: y must be in [0,9]. So we cannot go below 0 or above 9.\n\nThe goal is to get to (0,9) as quickly as possible.\n\nWe start at y=2 at turn 45.\n\nWe are to output the minimal H and the sequence of actions from turn 45 to turn 45+H-1 (so that after H-1 steps, we are at turn 45+H-1 and we have y_{45+H-1}=9).\n\nWe note that the player can only change by -1, 0, +1 per turn.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of turns without any cars would be 7 (since 9-2=7, and we can go up 1 per turn). But we have to avoid collisions.\n\nWe must check for each freeway we are on at each turn T (which is the y at turn T) whether at that turn T, there is a car on that freeway that has 0 in its span.\n\nWe are given the cars for freeways 1 to 8. Note that freeway 1 is y=1, ... freeway 8 is y=8. The player starts at y=2 (so freeway 2) and the goal is at y=9 (which is not a freeway, so no car collision at y=9).\n\nBut note: at the turn when we are at y=9, we are not on any freeway (since freeways are y=1..8). So we only care about collisions when we are on rows 1 to 8.\n\nWe are given:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-60, -25, left, 36) -> left-moving, so at time T, the car's span is [h - s*(T-45), tau - s*(T-45)] = [-60 - 36*(T-45), -25 - 36*(T-45)]\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1: (-60, -25, left, 36) -> [ -60 - 36*(T-45), -25 - 36*(T-45) ]\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: \n  (60,49,right,12) -> becomes [49 + 12*(T-45), 60 + 12*(T-45)]   [Note: for right-moving, the table gives (head, tail) but then in the update it uses [tau, h] becomes [tau+s*(T-t1), h+s*(T-t1)] so if at t1 the car is (60,49,right) then the head is 60 (the right end) and tail is 49 (the left end). So the span at t1 is [49,60]. Then at T: [49+12*(T-45), 60+12*(T-45)]\n  (24,13,right,12) -> [13+12*(T-45), 24+12*(T-45)]\n  (-12,-23,right,12) -> [-23+12*(T-45), -12+12*(T-45)]\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3: three cars with the same parameters.\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 3.\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (0,-11,right,6) -> [ -11+6*(T-45), 0+6*(T-45) ]\n\nFreeway 7: same as freeway 6: (0,-11,right,6) -> [ -11+6*(T-45), 0+6*(T-45) ]\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: \n  (0,-11,right,6) -> [ -11+6*(T-45), 0+6*(T-45) ]\n  (-48,-59,right,6) -> [ -59+6*(T-45), -48+6*(T-45) ]\n\nWe must avoid being on a freeway at turn T if at that turn T, 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nWe are to compute the minimal H and the sequence.\n\nSince H is minimal, we want to go up as much as possible. But we might have to wait (stay) or even go down to avoid a collision.\n\nWe can try to simulate step by step, from turn 45 onward, and see what the minimal H is.\n\nWe start at y=2 at turn 45.\n\nAt turn 45: we are at y=2. We must check freeway 2 at turn 45.\n\nFreeway 2: car is [ -60 - 36*(0), -25 - 36*(0) ] = [-60, -25]. 0 is not in [-60, -25]. So safe.\n\nWe have several options: U (to y=3), D (to y=1), S (stay at y=2).\n\nOur goal is to go to 9. So we prefer U.\n\nBut we have to look ahead because if we go to y=3 at the next turn, then at turn 46 we will be at y=3 and we have to check freeway 3 at turn 46.\n\nWe can use BFS (breadth-first search) or Dijkstra (since each step has same cost) in the state space: state = (turn, y). The turn is relative: we start at turn0=45, then 46, etc. We want to reach y=9 in minimal turns.\n\nThe state: (t, y) where t is the current turn (starting at 45) and y in [0,9]. We start at (45,2). We want to reach (T,9) for some T>=45.\n\nWe can simulate the cars at each turn T (>=45) for each freeway.\n\nWe'll compute for each freeway k (1..8) and for each turn T (>=45) the set of x where there is a car (i.e., the union of the spans of the cars on that freeway at turn T). Then if at turn T we are on freeway k (i.e., y=k) and 0 is in the set for freeway k at turn T, then collision.\n\nBut note: we don't need the entire set, we only care if 0 is in any of the spans. So for each freeway k and turn T, we can compute: is there a car on freeway k at turn T such that 0 is in its span?\n\nWe can precompute a 2D array: safe[k][T] for k=1..8 and T from 45 to ... (until we are sure we can reach 9). But T might be large? However, note that the cars move and eventually the cars on the left-moving freeways (1 and 2) will be moving left and become negative and then eventually might come back? But they are moving left and the speeds are high. Actually, the freeways 1 and 2: left-moving at 36 per turn. At turn 45, the car on freeway 1 and 2 is at [-60, -25]. After one turn (T=46): [-60-36, -25-36] = [-96,-61] -> even more negative. So 0 will never be in these spans? Because they are always negative and moving left.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 3,4,5: right-moving at 12 per turn. The cars are at:\n  [49,60] at T=45 -> 0 not in [49,60]\n  [13,24] -> not\n  [-23,-12] -> not (all negative or positive? -23 to -12: negative, so 0 not in)\n\nBut as T increases, the cars move right. For example, the car that is at [-23,-12] at T=45: at T=46: [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0]. So at T=46, the span is [-11,0]. 0 is included? Yes, because the span is [a,b] inclusive? The problem says \"span\", and we assume closed interval? The collision condition: \"0 in Span(T)\" meaning if 0 is between the endpoints inclusive.\n\nSo at T=46, freeway 3 (and 4,5) has a car at [-11,0] which includes 0. So if the player is on freeway 3 at turn 46, then collision.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6,7,8: \n  For the car (0,-11,right,6): at T=45: [-11,0] -> already includes 0? \n    At T=45: [ -11+6*0, 0+6*0 ] = [-11,0]. So 0 is in [-11,0] -> so at turn 45, if we were on freeway 6,7, or 8 (for the first car) we would collide? But we are at y=2 at turn45, so not on these.\n\nBut note freeway 6,7,8 at turn45: \n  freeway6: one car: [-11,0] -> 0 is in the span -> so if we were at freeway6 at turn45, we would collide. Similarly freeway7 and freeway8 (for the first car) at turn45: also [-11,0] so 0 is in.\n\nBut freeway8 has two cars: the second car: (-48,-59,right,6): at T=45: [-59+0, -48+0] = [-59,-48] -> 0 not in.\n\nSo at turn45:\n  freeway6: unsafe (because 0 in [-11,0])\n  freeway7: unsafe (same)\n  freeway8: unsafe because of the first car? yes, because the first car on freeway8 is the same as freeway6: (0,-11,right,6) -> so unsafe.\n\nBut we are at freeway2 at turn45: safe.\n\nNow, let's precompute for each freeway k and for T from 45 to, say, 45+20 (we hope we can reach in 20 turns) whether it is safe (i.e., no car at 0).\n\nWe'll compute for k=1..8 and T from 45 to 65 (to be safe).\n\nFreeway 1: car: left-moving, span at T: [ -60 -36*(T-45), -25 -36*(T-45) ]\n  This interval is always negative and moving left, so 0 never in -> always safe.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway1 -> always safe.\n\nFreeway 3,4,5: same set of cars. We'll compute for freeway3 (same for 4,5) for T>=45:\n\nCar1: (60,49,right,12) -> [49+12*(T-45), 60+12*(T-45)]\n  At T=45: [49,60] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n  At T=46: [49+12=61, 60+12=72] -> safe (0 not in)\n  ... always positive and increasing -> safe.\n\nCar2: (24,13,right,12) -> [13+12*(T-45), 24+12*(T-45)]\n  At T=45: [13,24] -> safe.\n  ... always positive -> safe.\n\nCar3: (-12,-23,right,12) -> [-23+12*(T-45), -12+12*(T-45)]\n  At T=45: [-23,-12] -> safe (0 not in)\n  At T=46: [-23+12=-11, -12+12=0] -> [ -11, 0 ] -> 0 is included -> unsafe at T=46 for freeway3,4,5.\n  At T=47: [-23+24=1, -12+24=12] -> [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n  At T=48: [ -23+36=13, -12+36=24] -> safe.\n\n  So freeway3,4,5: unsafe only at T=46? Actually at T=46: the interval is [-11,0] -> 0 is included. At T=47: [1,12] -> 0 not included.\n\n  But wait: at T=45: safe, T=46: unsafe, T=47: safe, T=48: safe, etc.\n\nFreeway6,7: one car: (0,-11,right,6) -> [ -11+6*(T-45), 0+6*(T-45) ]\n  At T=45: [-11,0] -> 0 is included -> unsafe.\n  At T=46: [-11+6=-5, 0+6=6] -> [-5,6] -> 0 is in -> unsafe.\n  At T=47: [-11+12=1, 0+12=12] -> [1,12] -> 0 not in -> safe.\n  At T=48: [ -11+18=7, 0+18=18] -> safe.\n\n  So freeway6,7: unsafe at T=45,46; safe from T=47 onward.\n\nFreeway8: two cars.\n  Car1: same as freeway6: (0,-11,right,6) -> same as above: unsafe at T=45,46; safe from T=47 onward.\n  Car2: (-48,-59,right,6) -> [ -59+6*(T-45), -48+6*(T-45) ]\n    At T=45: [-59,-48] -> safe (0 not in)\n    At T=46: [-59+6=-53, -48+6=-42] -> safe\n    ... always negative -> safe.\n\n  So for freeway8: unsafe at T=45 and T=46 because of the first car? \n    At T=45: first car: [-11,0] -> unsafe; second car: safe.\n    At T=46: first car: [-5,6] -> 0 in -> unsafe.\n    At T=47: first car: [1,12] -> safe; second car: [-59+12=-47, -48+12=-36] -> safe. So T=47 onward safe.\n\nSummary of unsafe freeways at each turn T (for T>=45):\n\nT=45:\n  k=1: safe\n  k=2: safe\n  k=3: safe\n  k=4: safe\n  k=5: safe\n  k=6: unsafe\n  k=7: unsafe\n  k=8: unsafe\n\nT=46:\n  k=1: safe\n  k=2: safe\n  k=3: unsafe (because of car3: [-11,0])\n  k=4: unsafe\n  k=5: unsafe\n  k=6: unsafe\n  k=7: unsafe\n  k=8: unsafe\n\nT=47:\n  k=1: safe\n  k=2: safe\n  k=3: safe (car3: [1,12] -> 0 not in)\n  k=4: safe\n  k=5: safe\n  k=6: safe\n  k=7: safe\n  k=8: safe\n\nT=48 and beyond: all safe? \n  For k=3,4,5: car3 at T>=47: [1+12*(T-47)?] Actually, at T=47: [1,12] and then at T=48: [1+12, 12+12]=[13,24] -> safe. \n  For k=6,7: from T=47 onward safe.\n  For k=8: same.\n\nSo the unsafe turns are only T=45 and T=46? But at T=45, we are already at y=2 (which is safe). At T=46, we are going to be at a freeway that we choose by the action at turn45.\n\nWe start at turn45 at y=2 (safe). Then we choose an action at turn45 that will determine y at turn46.\n\nAt turn45, we can choose:\n  U: then at turn46, y=3 -> freeway3 -> which is unsafe at T=46? (because at T=46, freeway3 is unsafe) -> collision.\n  D: then at turn46, y=1 -> freeway1 -> safe (because freeway1 is always safe).\n  S: then at turn46, y=2 -> freeway2 -> safe.\n\nSo we cannot go up at turn45 because that would put us at freeway3 at turn46 which is unsafe.\n\nWe can go down to 1 or stay at 2.\n\nBut we want to go to 9. So going down to 1 is not ideal, but we might have to.\n\nAfter turn45, we are at turn46 and we are either at y=1 or y=2.\n\nWe want to avoid T=46 for freeways 3,4,5,6,7,8. So we can only be at freeway1 or 2 at turn46.\n\nNow, at turn46, we choose an action.\n\nWe are at either y=1 or y=2.\n\nWe can then go up, down, or stay.\n\nBut note: at turn47, all freeways become safe. So we can then move freely.\n\nSo the plan:\n\nTurn45: we cannot go up, so we have two options: S (stay at 2) or D (go to 1).\n\nWe want to minimize H, so we want to go up as fast as possible.\n\nIf we stay at 2 at turn45 (so turn46 we are at 2), then at turn46 we can go up to 3? But at turn47 we will be at 3? Actually, at turn46 we are at 2, then we choose U: so at turn47 we are at 3.\n\nBut at turn47, freeway3 is safe (as we computed). So that is okay.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down to 1 at turn45, then at turn46 we are at 1. Then at turn46 we can go up to 2? Then at turn47 we are at 2? Then we can go up to 3 at turn47? Then at turn48 we are at 3? That would be slower.\n\nSo the faster option: \n  Turn45: S -> at turn46: y=2 (safe because freeway2 is safe at T=46)\n  Turn46: U -> at turn47: y=3 (freeway3 at turn47: safe)\n  Then we can go up every turn: \n      Turn47: U -> y=4 at turn48\n      Turn48: U -> y=5 at turn49\n      Turn49: U -> y=6 at turn50\n      Turn50: U -> y=7 at turn51\n      Turn51: U -> y=8 at turn52\n      Turn52: U -> y=9 at turn53\n\nBut wait: when we are at turn52 and we are at y=8 (freeway8) at turn52? Then we do U: so at turn53 we are at y=9.\n\nBut at turn52, we are at freeway8 at T=52: we computed that from T=47 onward freeway8 is safe? So yes.\n\nThen at turn53, we are at y=9 -> goal.\n\nTotal turns: from turn45 to turn53: that's 53-45+1? Actually, we are counting the actions: we start at turn45 (state), then we take an action at turn45, then at turn46, ... until the last action at turn52 that gets us to 9 at turn53.\n\nBut the problem: we are to output actions for turns t1 (45) to t1+H-1, and then we have y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nHere, we take actions at turns 45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52 -> 8 actions. Then at turn52 (the last action) we are moving to y=9? Actually:\n\nAt turn45: we start at y=2.\nAfter action at turn45: at turn46, y becomes 2 (if we did S) or 1 (if D) or 3 (if U, but we cannot do U).\n\nWe did S at turn45: so at turn46, y=2.\n\nThen at turn46: we do U: so at turn47, y=3.\n\nThen at turn47: U -> turn48: y=4.\n\n...\n\nAt turn52: we are at y=8 (from the action at turn51: at turn51 we did U: from y=7 at turn51 (which we reached at turn51) to y=8 at turn52? Actually, we need to track:\n\nTurn45: action S -> y46 = 2\nTurn46: action U -> y47 = 3\nTurn47: action U -> y48 = 4\nTurn48: action U -> y49 = 5\nTurn49: action U -> y50 = 6\nTurn50: action U -> y51 = 7\nTurn51: action U -> y52 = 8\nTurn52: action U -> y53 = 9\n\nSo at turn53, we are at 9. But the problem says: we are to have y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nHere, t1=45, and H is the number of turns (the number of actions). We take actions at turns 45 to 52 (inclusive) -> that's 8 actions (H=8). Then at the end of these 8 actions, we are at turn53? \n\nBut note: the player update: at turn t, we take action a_t, and then the next state (y_{t+1}) is computed.\n\nSo after the last action at turn52, we get y53=9.\n\nSo we have taken actions for t=45,46,...,52 (8 actions) and then at turn53 we are at 9.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence of actions is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, and then after that we have y_{t1+H-1} = 9? \n\nWait: the player update: \n  At turn t: we are at y_t, we take a_t, then we get y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta.\n\nSo if we take an action at turn t, then we get the next state at turn t+1.\n\nTherefore, to be at y=9 at turn T, we must have taken an action at turn T-1 that moved us to 9.\n\nSo if we are at y=8 at turn T-1, we take U and then at turn T we are at 9.\n\nSo we want to be at 9 at turn t1+H? Because the actions are taken at turns: t1, t1+1, ..., t1+H-1, and then the state at turn t1+H is y=9.\n\nIn our plan: \n  We start at turn45 (t1=45) at y=2.\n  After H actions (at turns 45,46,...,45+H-1), we are at turn45+H, and we want y_{45+H}=9.\n\nIn our sequence: \n  We have H=8: actions at 45,46,...,52 -> then at turn53 (which is 45+8) we are at 9.\n\nBut 45+8=53, so we are at turn53.\n\nSo H=8.\n\nBut is there a faster way? \n\nWe must avoid freeway3 at turn46. We did that by staying at 2 at turn45 and then going up at turn46.\n\nWhat if we go down at turn45? Then at turn46 we are at y=1. Then at turn46 we can go up to 2? Then at turn47 we are at 2. Then we start going up: at turn47: U -> 3 at turn48, then 4 at turn49, ... 9 at turn54? That would be 9 actions: H=9 -> slower.\n\nSo the minimal H is 8.\n\nBut wait: can we go up faster? We need to go from 2 to 9: that requires 7 upward moves. But we have to spend one turn waiting (at turn45 we did S: no move). So total 8 moves (one wait and 7 ups). That seems minimal.\n\nBut note: we could have gone up at turn45? We saw that if we go up at turn45, then at turn46 we are at 3 -> which is unsafe (freeway3 at T=46 is unsafe). So we cannot.\n\nAlternatively, can we go down and then go up through a different path? But we are constrained by the grid: we can only go to adjacent rows.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nTurn45: S (stay at 2)\nTurn46: U (to 3) -> at turn47 we are at 3 (and turn47 is safe for freeway3)\nThen we do 6 more U: \n  Turn47: U -> 4\n  Turn48: U -> 5\n  Turn49: U -> 6\n  Turn50: U -> 7\n  Turn51: U -> 8\n  Turn52: U -> 9\n\nBut wait: at turn52, we are at 8 and we do U: then at turn53 we are at 9.\n\nBut at turn52, when we are at y=8 (freeway8) at turn52: we know that freeway8 is safe at turn52? Yes, because after T=46, freeway8 is safe (from T=47 onward). Turn52>46, so safe.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 45: S\nTurn 46: U\nTurn 47: U\nTurn 48: U\nTurn 49: U\nTurn 50: U\nTurn 51: U\nTurn 52: U\n\nBut we have to check that at every step we are safe.\n\nLet's verify:\n\nTurn45: we are at y=2 -> safe (as computed: freeway2 at T=45 safe)\n\nAction: S -> so at turn46, we are still at y=2? Actually, no: we take action at turn45: S -> so we do not move. So at turn46, we are at y=2.\n\nAt turn46: we are at freeway2 at T=46: freeway2 is always safe -> safe.\n\nAction: U -> so we move to y=3 at turn47.\n\nAt turn47: we are at freeway3 at T=47: we computed that freeway3 at T=47 is safe (car3: [1,12] -> 0 not in) -> safe.\n\nAction: U -> move to y=4 at turn48.\n\nAt turn48: freeway4 at T=48: safe? We computed that freeway4 is safe at T=48 (because after T=46, safe) -> safe.\n\nSimilarly, at turn49: freeway5 at T=49: safe.\n\nTurn50: freeway6 at T=50: safe (from T=47 onward safe).\n\nTurn51: freeway7 at T=51: safe.\n\nTurn52: freeway8 at T=52: safe.\n\nThen at turn53: we are at y=9 -> not a freeway, so no collision.\n\nSo the sequence is 8 actions.\n\nBut wait: we have 8 actions: from turn45 to turn52. And we reach 9 at turn53.\n\nBut the problem: the sequence is for t from t1 to t1+H-1, and H=8, so t1=45 to 45+7=52? Then we output 8 actions.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 45: S\nTurn 46: U\nTurn 47: U\nTurn 48: U\nTurn 49: U\nTurn 50: U\nTurn 51: U\nTurn 52: U\n}\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that we are not going above 9? We are going from 2 to 3,4,...,9: so at each step we are within [0,9]. At turn52 we are at 8 and we go to 9: valid.\n\nIs there a way to do it in 7? That would require 7 upward moves without waiting. But we cannot do the first upward move at turn45 because that would lead to y=3 at turn46 which is unsafe. So we must wait at turn45. Therefore, 8 is minimal.\n\nBut what if we go up at turn45 and then at turn46 we go down? That would avoid freeway3 at turn46? But if we go up at turn45: then at turn46 we are at 3 -> which is unsafe -> collision. So we cannot.\n\nTherefore, the above sequence is minimal.\n\nSo the answer is as above.\n</think>\nTo reach the position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 2)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 45\\) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1, \\dots, 8\\), the following sequence of actions is determined. The analysis shows that moving up immediately at turn 45 would place the player at freeway 3 (\\(y = 3\\)) at turn 46, which is unsafe due to a car spanning \\([-11, 0]\\) at that turn. Therefore, the player must stay at \\(y = 2\\) at turn 45 to avoid collision, and then proceed upward from turn 46 onward.\n\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) is 8, meaning actions are taken from turn 45 to turn 52, resulting in the player reaching \\(y = 9\\) at turn 53. The sequence is as follows:\n\n- **Turn 45**: Stay (S) to remain at \\(y = 2\\), which is safe as freeway 2 has no car at \\(x = 0\\).\n- **Turn 46**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 3\\), safe as freeway 3 is safe at turn 47 (car spans are \\([61, 72]\\), \\([25, 36]\\), and \\([1, 12]\\), none containing 0).\n- **Turn 47**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 4\\), safe as freeway 4 is safe at turn 48.\n- **Turn 48**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 5\\), safe as freeway 5 is safe at turn 49.\n- **Turn 49**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 6\\), safe as freeway 6 is safe at turn 50 (car span \\([7, 18]\\) does not contain 0).\n- **Turn 50**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 7\\), safe as freeway 7 is safe at turn 51 (car span \\([13, 24]\\) does not contain 0).\n- **Turn 51**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 8\\), safe as freeway 8 is safe at turn 52 (car spans \\([13, 24]\\) and \\([-47, -36]\\), neither contains 0).\n- **Turn 52**: Move up (U) to \\(y = 9\\), reaching the goal at turn 53.\n\nThis sequence ensures safety at every turn and achieves the goal in the minimal \\(H = 8\\) turns.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 45: S \\\\\nTurn 46: U \\\\\nTurn 47: U \\\\\nTurn 48: U \\\\\nTurn 49: U \\\\\nTurn 50: U \\\\\nTurn 51: U \\\\\nTurn 52: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 46, and the player is at (0,2). We need to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on freeways 1 to 8.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S). The vertical position y is in [0,9]. We start at y=2 and want to get to y=9.\n\nCollision occurs at turn T if the player is on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) and the car on that freeway at turn T has a span that includes 0 (the x-coordinate of the player). Note that the player is only on one freeway at a time, and when moving from y to y' at turn T, the player is on y at turn T and then moves to y' at the next turn (so at turn T, the player is on y, and at turn T+1, the player is on y').\n\nImportant: When the player moves from y to y+1 at turn T, then at turn T the player is on y (so we check the car on freeway y at turn T) and at turn T+1 the player is on y+1 (so we check the car on freeway y+1 at turn T+1). Similarly for moving down.\n\nGiven the car update rules:\n- For a left-moving car: at time T, the span is [h - s*(T - t1), tau - s*(T - t1)]? But note the initial state at t1 is given. Actually, the update is from t1 to T: the car moves with speed s. For left-moving, it moves to the left (so decreasing x). For right-moving, it moves to the right (increasing x).\n\nBut note: the representation of the car span: \n- For a left-moving car: the car is defined by (head, tail) at t1. The head is the front? But in the update, for left-moving: the entire car moves left. So at T, the head becomes h - s*(T-t1) and the tail becomes tau - s*(T-t1). Similarly for right-moving: the head becomes h + s*(T-t1) and tail becomes tau + s*(T-t1). However, note that in the right-moving case, the initial span is given as (tau, head) meaning that the tail is at tau and head at head? Actually, the representation for right-moving is given as [tau, head] meaning the car extends from tau to head (with head > tau). Similarly, for left-moving, the head is at h and tail at tau, and since it's moving left, the head is the rightmost point? Actually, the problem says for left-moving: [h, tau] becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)] and for right-moving: [tau, h] becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. So the order in the representation is always from left to right? Actually, for left-moving, the head is the right end and tail the left? But the span is given as [h, tau] and then becomes [h - s*dt, tau - s*dt]. But if the car is moving left, then the entire car moves left. However, the representation [h, tau] might be in decreasing order? Actually, the problem does not specify the order of h and tau. But note:\n\nIn the left-moving car: the initial state at t1: head=48, tail=83? That would be [48,83] but then 48<83? But then moving left: at T, the span becomes [48 - s*(T-t1), 83 - s*(T-t1)]? Then the left end would be 48 - s*(T-t1) and the right end 83 - s*(T-t1). But then the car is moving left, so the entire car is shifting left. However, the initial head=48 and tail=83? That would imply the car is from 48 to 83? But then it's a right-moving car? There's a confusion.\n\nLet me clarify the representation:\n\nFor left-moving cars: the car is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). The head is the front of the car? In left-moving, the front is the leftmost? Or the rightmost? The problem states:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, tau] -> becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]\n\nBut if the car is moving left, then both endpoints decrease. However, if the initial [h, tau] is given with h < tau, then the car is from h to tau. But then when it moves left, the entire segment moves left. Alternatively, if h > tau, then the car is from tau to h? But the problem says \"head\" and \"tail\". Typically, head is the front. For a left-moving car, the front (head) is the leftmost? Then tail would be the rightmost? That would be unusual because usually we think of the head as the leading part. So if the car is moving left, the head (leading part) is at the left, so the head would be the leftmost. Then the tail would be the rightmost. So the car spans from head (left) to tail (right). Then the initial representation: head=48, tail=83? Then the car is from 48 to 83? But that's a segment of length 36? Then moving left: at time T, the head (left end) is at 48 - s*(T-t1) and the tail (right end) is at 83 - s*(T-t1). But then the car is still [48 - s*dt, 83 - s*dt]. However, that car is moving left? Then the entire car moves left, which is correct.\n\nBut wait, the problem says for left-moving: \"Span(t1) = [h, tau]\" and then becomes [h - s*(T-t1), tau - s*(T-t1)]. If h=48, tau=83, then the initial car is from 48 to 83? But then when it moves left, the left end becomes 48 - s*dt and the right end becomes 83 - s*dt. So the car is still [48-s*dt, 83-s*dt]. But note: the problem says for left-moving, the head is at h and tail at tau? And then the update subtracts s*(T-t1) from both. So the head (front) is at h and then moves to h - s*(T-t1). So the head is the leading part? Then if the car is moving left, the head is the leftmost? So the car is [head, tail] with head < tail? Then the representation is in increasing order? That makes sense: the car occupies [head, tail] at t1, and then moves to [head - s*dt, tail - s*dt] at T.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: the head is the front? Then for right-moving, the head is the rightmost? Then the car is given as (head, tail, direction, speed). The representation in the table for right-moving: the problem says \"Span(t1) = [tau, head]\" meaning that the tail is at tau and head at head? But then the update: [tau + s*dt, head + s*dt]. So the entire car moves right. And the car spans from tau to head? So if head > tau, then the car is [tau, head] at t1, and [tau+s*dt, head+s*dt] at T.\n\nBut in the given data, for freeway 3,4,5: we have three cars: \n  (-48, -59, right, 12) -> this is a right-moving car? Then the representation at t1: [tau, head] = [-59, -48]? But the problem writes (head, tail, ...) so the first number is head? Then for right-moving, the head is -48 and tail is -59? Then the car is from tail to head: [-59, -48]? Then at T, it becomes [-59 + 12*(T-46), -48 + 12*(T-46)].\n\nSimilarly, (36,25,right,12): head=36, tail=25? Then the car is [25,36] at t1, and at T: [25+12*(T-46), 36+12*(T-46)].\n\nAnd (0,-11,right,12): head=0, tail=-11? Then car is [-11,0] at t1, and at T: [-11+12*(T-46), 0+12*(T-46)].\n\nBut wait, the problem states for right-moving: \"Span(t1) = [tau, head]\". So the representation in the table is given as (head, tail, ...) but then we must form [tau, head]? So the tail is the second number? Then for (head, tail, direction, speed) for a right-moving car, the span is [tail, head]? So the car is from tail to head? And head > tail? Then for (-48, -59, right, 12): head=-48, tail=-59? Then the span is [tail, head] = [-59, -48]. Similarly, (36,25,right,12): [25,36]. (0,-11,right,12): [-11,0].\n\nSimilarly, for left-moving: for freeway 1 and 2: (48,83,left,36): head=48, tail=83? Then the span at t1 is [head, tail] = [48,83]. Then at T: [48-36*(T-46), 83-36*(T-46)].\n\nBut note: the car on freeway 1: (48,83,left,36). The car is [48,83] at t1? Then at T, it becomes [48-36*(T-46), 83-36*(T-46)]. The length is 83-48=35? But speed is 36? That seems odd because the car moves 36 units per turn? Then in one turn, the entire car moves 36 units to the left? Then the car will move off the screen quickly.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6,7,8: \n  freeway 6: (6,-5,right,6) -> right-moving: so head=6, tail=-5? Then the car is [tail, head] = [-5,6] at t1? Then at T: [-5+6*(T-46), 6+6*(T-46)].\n  freeway 7: same as 6: [-5,6] at t1, then moves right.\n  freeway 8: two cars: (6,-5,right,6) and (-42,-53,right,6). \n      For (6,-5,right,6): same as above: [-5,6] at t1.\n      For (-42,-53,right,6): head=-42, tail=-53? Then car is [-53,-42] at t1.\n\nNow, the player is at (0,y) at each turn. We need to avoid being on a freeway y (from 1 to 8) at a turn T when there is a car on that freeway whose span at T includes 0.\n\nSo, for a given freeway k, and turn T, we must check if 0 is in the span of any car on freeway k at turn T.\n\nWe start at turn 46 at y=2. We are on freeway 2? Actually, freeways are y=1 to 8. The player is at (0,2) at turn 46, so we are on freeway 2? Then we must check if at turn 46, there is a car on freeway 2 that has 0 in its span.\n\nFreeway 2: one left-moving car: (48,83,left,36). At T=46: the car is at [48,83]. Does 0 lie in [48,83]? No. So safe.\n\nOur goal: y=9. Note that y=9 is not a freeway (freeways are 1-8). So when we are at y=9, we are safe from cars. But we have to get to y=9 at some turn.\n\nWe are at (0,2) at turn 46. We can move U (to 3), D (to 1), or S (stay at 2). We need to minimize the number of turns.\n\nThe minimal vertical steps: from 2 to 9 is 7 steps up. But we might have to wait because of cars. So we need to check at each freeway we step on at each turn.\n\nWe must plan a sequence of actions that avoids collisions.\n\nLet me denote dt = T - 46. Then for a car, we can compute its position at turn T.\n\nWe are at turn 46: y=2.\n\nWe want to get to y=9. The minimal H is at least 7 (if we go up every turn). But we have to check if we can go straight up without colliding.\n\nWe will simulate the moves and check for collisions at the freeways we are on at each turn.\n\nNote: when we are at turn T, we are at a position (0, y_T). Then we choose an action a_T that determines y_{T+1}. Then at turn T, we are on freeway y_T (if y_T is between 1 and 8) and we must avoid collision with the cars on that freeway at turn T.\n\nWe start at T=46, y=2 (freeway 2). Check freeway 2 at T=46: car is [48,83] -> 0 not in [48,83] -> safe.\n\nThen we can try to move up as much as possible.\n\nBut we have to check each step.\n\nPlan: we need to go from y=2 to y=9. We can only move one step at a time. We can also stay or move down to avoid collisions.\n\nWe will consider the next turns.\n\nLet me compute the positions of the cars at future turns.\n\nFirst, for freeway 1 and 2: same car: (48,83,left,36). At T, the car is at [48 - 36*(T-46), 83 - 36*(T-46)].\n\nWe need to check when this car might have 0 in its span? Solve:\n  48 - 36*(T-46) <= 0 <= 83 - 36*(T-46)\n\nBut note: the car moves 36 units per turn to the left. So at T=46: [48,83] -> 0 is not in [48,83].\nAt T=47: [48-36=12, 83-36=47] -> 0 not in [12,47]\nAt T=48: [12-36=-24, 47-36=11] -> now the span is [-24,11]. 0 is in [-24,11]? Yes! So at T=48, the car on freeway 1 and 2 (if they are the same) will cover 0? But note: freeway 1 and 2 both have the same car? The table says for freeway 1 and 2, the same car? Actually, the table lists:\n\n| Freeway k | Cars |\n| 1 | (48,83,left,36) |\n| 2 | (48,83,left,36) |\n\nSo both freeways have the same car? Then at T=48, both freeway 1 and 2 have a car that covers 0? Actually, the same car? But they are on different freeways? So the car is duplicated? Then we must avoid freeway 1 and 2 at T=48.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"cars on freeway i\". So each freeway has its own set of cars. So freeway 1 has a car (48,83,left,36) and freeway 2 has the same? So two independent cars? Then at T=48, freeway 1 has a car at [-24,11] and freeway 2 has a car at [-24,11]? So both freeways 1 and 2 are blocked at T=48.\n\nNow, freeway 3,4,5: each has three cars: \n  car1: (-48,-59,right,12) -> at t1: [tail, head] = [-59,-48] -> at T: [-59+12*(T-46), -48+12*(T-46)]\n  car2: (36,25,right,12) -> wait, the representation: (head, tail) = (36,25) -> so tail=25, head=36? Then [25,36] at t1? Then at T: [25+12*(T-46), 36+12*(T-46)]\n  car3: (0,-11,right,12) -> tail=-11, head=0 -> [-11,0] at t1? Then at T: [-11+12*(T-46), 0+12*(T-46)]\n\nBut note: for freeway 3,4,5, they all have the same three cars? So independent per freeway? Then each freeway has three cars.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 6,7: one car: (6,-5,right,6) -> tail=-5, head=6 -> [-5,6] at t1? Then at T: [-5+6*(T-46), 6+6*(T-46)]\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: \n  car1: (6,-5,right,6) -> same as above: [-5,6] at t1, then [-5+6*(T-46), 6+6*(T-46)]\n  car2: (-42,-53,right,6) -> tail=-53, head=-42 -> [-53,-42] at t1? Then at T: [-53+6*(T-46), -42+6*(T-46)]\n\nWe are at T0=46.\n\nWe start at y=2 (freeway2). At T=46: freeway2 car: [48,83] -> 0 not in [48,83] -> safe.\n\nWe want to go to y=9. We need to go through freeways 3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nWe are going to simulate the path.\n\nWe are at T=46, y=2.\n\nWe can choose: U (go to y=3 at T=47), D (go to y=1 at T=47), or S (stay at y=2 at T=47).\n\nBut note: if we go to y=3 at T=47, then at T=47 we will be on freeway 3? And we must check freeway 3 at T=47.\n\nSimilarly, if we stay at y=2 at T=47, then we are on freeway 2 at T=47.\n\nIf we go down to y=1 at T=47, then we are on freeway 1 at T=47.\n\nLet's compute for T=47:\n\nFreeway 1 and 2: same car: [48-36=12, 83-36=47] -> [12,47] -> 0 not in [12,47] -> safe.\n\nFreeway 3,4,5: \n  car1: [-59+12, -48+12] = [-47,-36] -> 0 not in [-47,-36]\n  car2: [25+12, 36+12] = [37,48] -> 0 not in [37,48]\n  car3: [-11+12, 0+12] = [1,12] -> 0 is in [1,12]? Yes! So at T=47, freeway 3,4,5 are blocked by car3? Because 0 is in [1,12]? Actually, [1,12] does include 0? 0 is not in [1,12] because 1>0. So no? [1,12] is from 1 to 12, so 0 is not included. So safe? \n\nBut wait: the car3 at t1: (0,-11,right,12) -> tail=-11, head=0 -> at t1: [-11,0]? Then at T=47: [-11+12, 0+12] = [1,12]. So [1,12] does not contain 0. So freeway 3,4,5 are safe at T=47.\n\nFreeway 6,7: car: [-5+6, 6+6] = [1,12] -> 0 not in [1,12] -> safe.\n\nFreeway 8: \n  car1: same as freeway6: [1,12]\n  car2: [-53+6, -42+6] = [-47,-36] -> safe.\n\nSo at T=47, all freeways are safe? \n\nBut we are starting at y=2 at T=46. Then we can choose to go up to y=3 at T=47.\n\nAt T=47, we are at y=3 (freeway3). We need to check freeway3 at T=47: as above, the three cars: none contains 0? So safe.\n\nThen we can go up again to y=4 at T=48? But at T=48, freeway1 and2 are blocked? But we are not on freeway1 or2 at T=48? We are at y=4 at T=48? Then we are on freeway4? So we need to check freeway4 at T=48.\n\nBut note: we must check the freeway we are on at each turn.\n\nAt T=48, if we are at y=4 (freeway4), then we check freeway4 at T=48.\n\nFreeway4: same as freeway3,4,5: three cars at T=48:\n\n  car1: [-59+12*2, -48+12*2] = [-59+24, -48+24] = [-35,-24] -> safe (0 not in [-35,-24])\n  car2: [25+24, 36+24] = [49,60] -> safe\n  car3: [-11+24, 0+24] = [13,24] -> safe\n\nSo freeway4 is safe at T=48.\n\nBut what about freeway1 and2 at T=48? They are blocked, but we are not on them.\n\nSo we can go up: from T=46: y=2 -> T=47: y=3 -> T=48: y=4.\n\nThen at T=48, we are at y=4. Now we want to go to y=5 at T=49? Then at T=49, we are at y=5 (freeway5). Check freeway5 at T=49:\n\n  car1: [-59+12*3, -48+12*3] = [-59+36, -48+36] = [-23,-12] -> safe\n  car2: [25+36, 36+36] = [61,72] -> safe\n  car3: [-11+36, 0+36] = [25,36] -> safe\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen T=49: y=5 -> T=50: y=6 (freeway6). Check freeway6 at T=50:\n\n  freeway6 has one car: at T=50: [-5+6*(50-46)= -5+6*4= -5+24=19, 6+24=30] -> [19,30] -> 0 not in [19,30] -> safe.\n\nThen T=50: y=6 -> T=51: y=7 (freeway7). Check freeway7 at T=51:\n\n  same car as freeway6: [ -5+6*(51-46)= -5+6*5=25, 6+30=36] -> [25,36] -> safe.\n\nThen T=51: y=7 -> T=52: y=8 (freeway8). Check freeway8 at T=52:\n\n  freeway8 has two cars:\n    car1: same as above: [-5+6*(52-46)= -5+6*6= -5+36=31, 6+36=42] -> [31,42] -> safe.\n    car2: [-53+6*(52-46)= -53+36= -17, -42+36= -6] -> [-17,-6] -> 0 not in [-17,-6] -> safe.\n\nThen T=52: y=8 -> T=53: y=9 -> we are at y=9, which is the goal.\n\nSo the sequence: from T=46 to T=53: we move up every turn.\n\nT=46: start at y=2 -> action U -> to y=3 at T=47\nT=47: at y=3 -> action U -> to y=4 at T=48\nT=48: at y=4 -> action U -> to y=5 at T=49\nT=49: at y=5 -> action U -> to y=6 at T=50\nT=50: at y=6 -> action U -> to y=7 at T=51\nT=51: at y=7 -> action U -> to y=8 at T=52\nT=52: at y=8 -> action U -> to y=9 at T=53\n\nTotal turns: from T=46 to T=53: that's 7 actions (from T=46 to T=52) and we reach y=9 at T=53? Actually, we start at T=46 at y=2. After one action (at T=46) we are at T=47 at y=3. After two actions: T=48, y=4. ... After 7 actions: at T=46+7=53, we are at y=2+7=9. So H=7.\n\nBut we must check every step: we have checked the freeways we are on at each turn:\n\nT=46: y=2 (freeway2) -> safe (as above)\nT=47: y=3 (freeway3) -> safe\nT=48: y=4 (freeway4) -> safe\nT=49: y=5 (freeway5) -> safe\nT=50: y=6 (freeway6) -> safe\nT=51: y=7 (freeway7) -> safe\nT=52: y=8 (freeway8) -> safe\n\nSo it seems we can do it in 7 moves.\n\nBut wait, at T=46, we are at y=2 and we are safe. Then we move to y=3 at T=47. But at T=47, freeway3 is safe. Then at T=48, we are at y=4: freeway4 safe. But what about the freeway we leave? We don't care because we are not on it at that turn.\n\nHowever, we must check that we don't go below 0 or above 9? The update says y_{t+1} in [0,9]. We are going from 2 to 9: so we are always in [0,9] when we move up.\n\nBut we must also consider if we are forced to move down? In this plan, we don't.\n\nBut is there a problem at T=48? We are at y=4. But what about the freeway2 at T=48? We are not on it. But at T=48, freeway2 is blocked? But we are not on it. So it's okay.\n\nBut wait: we were on freeway2 at T=46 and T=47? At T=47, we were on freeway3? Actually:\n\nAt T=46: we start at y=2 -> then we take action at T=46: we choose a_{46}. Then at the same turn T=46, we are at y=2? Then we move to the next position at T=47.\n\nSo the position at T=46: (0,2) -> we are at freeway2 at T=46: safe.\n\nThen we choose a_{46}=U -> then at T=47, we are at y=3 -> and we are on freeway3 at T=47: we check the cars on freeway3 at T=47: which we did: safe.\n\nSimilarly, at T=47: we choose a_{47}=U -> then at T=48, we are at y=4: on freeway4 at T=48: safe.\n\nSo the plan is safe.\n\nBut let me double-check the freeway3 at T=47: \n\nFreeway3 at T=47: \n  car1: [-59 + 12*(47-46) = -59+12 = -47, -48+12=-36] -> [-47,-36] -> no 0.\n  car2: [25+12=37, 36+12=48] -> [37,48] -> no 0.\n  car3: [-11+12=1, 0+12=12] -> [1,12] -> no 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway4 at T=48: \n  car1: [-59+12*2=-35, -48+24=-24] -> [-35,-24] -> no 0.\n  car2: [25+24=49,36+24=60] -> [49,60] -> no 0.\n  car3: [-11+24=13,0+24=24] -> [13,24] -> no 0.\n\nFreeway5 at T=49: \n  car1: [-59+36=-23, -48+36=-12] -> [-23,-12] -> no 0.\n  car2: [25+36=61,36+36=72] -> [61,72] -> no 0.\n  car3: [-11+36=25,0+36=36] -> [25,36] -> no 0.\n\nFreeway6 at T=50: \n  car: [-5+6*4=19, 6+24=30] -> [19,30] -> no 0.\n\nFreeway7 at T=51: \n  car: [-5+6*5=25, 6+30=36] -> [25,36] -> no 0.\n\nFreeway8 at T=52: \n  car1: [-5+6*6=31, 6+36=42] -> [31,42] -> no 0.\n  car2: [-53+6*6=-17, -42+36=-6] -> [-17,-6] -> no 0.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of turns is 7, and the sequence is 7 consecutive U's.\n\nSo the actions:\n\nTurn 46: U\nTurn 47: U\nTurn 48: U\nTurn 49: U\nTurn 50: U\nTurn 51: U\nTurn 52: U\n\nThen at turn 53, we are at (0,9).\n\nBut note: the sequence of actions is for t from t1 to t1+H-1? The problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" meaning H actions: from t=t1 to t=t1+H-1.\n\nAnd we reach (0,9) at turn t1+H? Actually, the state after the last action: after H actions, we are at turn t1+H. And we want y_{t1+H-1} = 9? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"minimizes H such that y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9\"\n\nSo we start at turn t1 (46) at position (0,y_{46})= (0,2). Then after H actions (from turn 46 to turn 46+H-1), we have y_{46+H-1} = 9.\n\nIn our plan: \n  at turn 46: after action U, at turn 47: y=3\n  at turn 47: after action U, at turn 48: y=4\n  ...\n  at turn 52: after action U, at turn 53: y=9.\n\nSo we have y_{53} = 9. And 53 = 46 + 7. So H-1 = 7? Then H=8? \n\nBut wait: the index: we have actions at turns: 46,47,48,49,50,51,52 (7 actions). Then at the end of these actions, at turn 53, we are at y=9. But the problem says we require y_{t1 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nHere, t1=46, and we want y_{46 + H - 1} = 9.\n\nAfter 7 actions, we have y_{46+7} = y_{53}=9. So we have 46 + H - 1 = 53? Then H-1=7 -> H=8.\n\nBut then we have 8 actions? But we only used 7.\n\nAlternatively, the state at the beginning of turn t: we are at y_t. Then we choose an action a_t, then we update to y_{t+1}. So after H actions (from t=46 to t=46+H-1), we have y_{46+H} = 9? Then we require y_{46+H} = 9. Then 46+H = 53? H=7.\n\nBut the problem says: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nLet me read carefully: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9), ... such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\"\n\nSo after the actions from t1 to t1+H-1 (H actions), we have at turn t1+H-1, the player is at (0,9).\n\nBut in our case, at turn 46 (t1), we start. Then we take action at t1 (46), which moves us to t1+1 (47) at y=3. Then we take action at t1+1 (47) to go to t1+2 (48) at y=4, and so on. After the action at turn 52 (which is t1+6), we go to turn 53 (t1+7) at y=9.\n\nBut we are at y=9 at turn t1+7. So we require y_{t1+H-1}=9. So t1+H-1 = 46 + H - 1 = 53? Then H-1=7? H=8.\n\nBut then we would have to have 8 actions? But we only need 7 moves.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might count the starting turn as turn 0? But the problem says \"current turn is t1\", and we are at (0,y_{t1}) at turn t1.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns t1 to t1+H-1, and then at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9).\n\nBut in our case, we are at (0,9) at turn 53 = t1+7. So we need t1+H-1 = t1+7 -> H-1=7 -> H=8.\n\nThen we must have 8 actions? But we only did 7. So what is the 8th action? We are already at 9 at turn 53. But the requirement is that at turn t1+H-1=46+8-1=53, we are at y=9. So we don't need an action at turn 53? We only need actions from 46 to 52? That's 7 actions. But then H=8? \n\nThe problem says: the sequence is {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} -> that is, for t=0 to H-1: so t1+0, t1+1, ... t1+H-1. The number of actions is H.\n\nBut we need to be at y_{t1+H-1}=9.\n\nIn our plan: we take actions at t1, t1+1, ..., t1+6 (7 actions: H=7). Then at turn t1+7 (53), we are at y=9. But the condition is y_{t1+H-1}=y_{46+7-1}=y_{52}=9? But at turn 52, we are at y=8, not 9.\n\nSo we are at y=9 at turn 53, which is t1+7. We require y_{t1+H-1}=9. So we need t1+H-1 = t1+7 -> H-1=7 -> H=8.\n\nThen we must have 8 actions? But we only need 7 moves to go from 2 to 9. How can we have 8 actions?\n\nWe can add a stay at the end? But we are already at 9. So we can do:\n\nAfter 7 moves (U at 46 to 52), we are at turn 53 at y=9. But we need to be at y=9 at turn 52? Then we must get to y=9 earlier? But we cannot because we start at 2 and need 7 moves.\n\nAlternatively, we can get to y=9 at an earlier turn? But minimal steps is 7.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to move down or stay. But we don't want to take extra steps.\n\nBut the condition is: at turn t1+H-1, we must be at y=9. In our plan, at turn 52 (t1+6), we are at y=8. Then we take action at turn 52: U -> to y=9 at turn 53. So at turn 52, we are not at 9. So we must take the action at turn 52 to get to 9 at turn 53. But then at turn 53 we are at 9, but turn 53 is t1+7, so we require H-1=7 -> H=8.\n\nBut then the last action is at turn 52 (t1+6) and we have one more action? But we are already at 9 at turn 53. So we don't need to do anything? But the sequence must have H actions. \n\nWe can do: at turn 53, we are at y=9. Then we can do a stay at turn 53? But that would be the 8th action? Then at turn 54, we are still at 9. But we need to be at 9 at turn t1+H-1=46+8-1=53? Then at turn 53, we are at 9? How?\n\nLet me clarify the timeline:\n\n- At turn 46: we start at (0,2). We are at the beginning of turn 46. Then we choose action a_{46}. Then we move to the next state: at the beginning of turn 47, we are at y_{47} = y_{46} + delta.\n\nSo after taking action at turn 46, we are at turn 47 at a new position.\n\nSimilarly, after taking action at turn t, we are at turn t+1.\n\nSo to be at y=9 at the beginning of turn T, we must have taken an action at turn T-1 that moves us to y=9 (if we were at y=8 at turn T-1 and we did U, for example).\n\nWe want at the beginning of turn t1+H-1, we are at y=9.\n\nIn our case, t1=46. We want at the beginning of turn 46+H-1, we are at (0,9).\n\nWith 7 moves: \n  at beginning of turn 46: (0,2)\n  after action a46 (U): at turn 47: (0,3)\n  ...\n  after action a52 (U): at turn 53: (0,9)\n\nSo at the beginning of turn 53, we are at (0,9). Now, 53 = 46+H-1 -> H-1=7 -> H=8.\n\nTherefore, we need H=8, and we have 8 actions? But we only have 7 actions so far? The actions are from t=46 to t=52? That's 7 actions. We need one more action? But we are already at 9 at turn 53. So we can do a stay at turn 53? But then at turn 54, we are still at 9. But we want to be at 9 at turn 53? And we are.\n\nBut the condition is: we take actions from t1 to t1+H-1: that is, from 46 to 46+7=53? So we take an action at turn 53? Then after that action, we go to turn 54. But we want to be at 9 at turn 53? \n\nActually, the state at the beginning of turn 53 is already 9. Then we take an action at turn 53? But then we move to turn 54. But the requirement is that at the beginning of turn 53 (which is t1+H-1=46+8-1=53) we are at 9. So we are. Then we can take any action at turn 53? But that action doesn't change the fact that at turn 53 (before the action) we are at 9.\n\nBut the sequence must include actions for turns 46 to 53? That's 8 actions.\n\nBut the problem says: we need to be at (0,9) at turn t1+H-1. So we are at turn 53 at (0,9) at the beginning of the turn. Then we choose an action. We can choose S (stay) at turn 53. Then we remain at (0,9) at turn 54. But we don't care about after.\n\nSo the sequence would be:\n\nTurn 46: U\nTurn 47: U\nTurn 48: U\nTurn 49: U\nTurn 50: U\nTurn 51: U\nTurn 52: U\nTurn 53: S   (to stay at 9)\n\nBut is that minimal? H=8. But we could have reached at turn 53 with 7 moves, but then we need an extra action? So the minimal H is 8? But that seems odd because we only need 7 moves.\n\nAlternatively, we can be at 9 at an earlier turn? For example, if we can get to 9 at turn 52? Then we would require H-1=52-46=6 -> H=7. Then we would be at 9 at turn 52.\n\nBut we start at 2. We need 7 moves. So we cannot get to 9 at turn 52.\n\nAnother idea: we can move faster? But we can only move one step per turn.\n\nSo the minimal number of moves is 7, which takes 7 turns? But the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\", and then the sequence of H actions.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". What is a \"turn\"? In the context, a turn is when we take an action. So we take H actions, meaning H turns.\n\nBut we are required to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn t1+H-1? \n\nWe start at turn t1 (46). After 0 actions, we are at turn 46. After 1 action, we are at turn 47. After 2 actions, we are at turn 48. ... After 7 actions, we are at turn 53.\n\nSo to be at (0,9) at the beginning of turn 53, we need 7 actions. Then H=7? But the problem says \"sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" and then at turn t1+H-1, we are at (0,9). \n\nIf H=7, then we are at turn t1+7-1=46+6=52. But we are at y=8 at turn 52? Not 9.\n\nTherefore, we must have H=8: then we are at turn t1+8-1=53. And we are at 9 at the beginning of turn 53. Then we have taken 7 U's and one extra action? But we are at 9 at turn 53, so the last action (at turn 52) got us to 9 at turn 53. Then we need an action at turn 53? Which we set to S.\n\nBut the problem says: the sequence is for t from t1 to t1+H-1: so 8 actions: t=46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53.\n\nBut at turn 53, we are already at 9? So we can choose S.\n\nSo the minimal H is 8? But we could have stayed at some point to make the total turns more? But we want minimal H.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to get to 9 at turn 52? Then we would only need H=7: because at turn 46+7-1=52, we are at 9.\n\nBut to get from 2 to 9 in 6 moves? We need 7 steps. So impossible.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 8, and the sequence is 7 U's and then one S at the end? But the S is at turn 53.\n\nBut we can also do the S earlier? But that would increase the time? We want minimal H.\n\nH=8 is the minimal because we cannot get to 9 before turn 53.\n\nBut note: we start at turn 46 at y=2. After one move at turn 46: turn 47, y=3. After two: turn 48, y=4. ... After seven moves: turn 53, y=9. So we cannot get to 9 before turn 53.\n\nTherefore, we must have H=8, with the last action being at turn 53? But that action doesn't help us reach 9, but we are already there.\n\nBut the problem requires that at turn t1+H-1 (53) we are at 9, and we are. Then we take an action at that turn? But the action at turn 53 happens after we are already at 9? And then we go to turn 54.\n\nBut the condition only requires that we are at 9 at the beginning of turn 53? Then the action at turn 53 can be anything? And we can choose S.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 46: U\nTurn 47: U\nTurn 48: U\nTurn 49: U\nTurn 50: U\nTurn 51: U\nTurn 52: U\nTurn 53: S\n\nBut is there a problem with collision at turn 53? We are at y=9 at the beginning of turn 53. Then we take action S. Then at turn 53, we are at freeway? y=9 is not a freeway (freeways are 1-8). So we are safe. Then we stay at y=9.\n\nBut note: at turn 53, we are at y=9, so we are not on any freeway. So no collision.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 8.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". And we have 8 actions? So 8 turns. But in the first 7 turns we move up, and the last turn we stay.\n\nBut we could do without the last stay? But the condition requires that at turn t1+H-1 we are at 9. If we do only 7 actions, then at turn t1+7-1=52, we are at y=8, not 9.\n\nSo we must do 8 actions.\n\nBut note: the problem might interpret \"turns\" differently? The initial turn is given, and then we take actions for H turns? And after H actions, we are at the state at turn t1+H. Then we require that state to be (0,9). Then we would have H=7: because after 7 actions, we are at turn 53 at (0,9).\n\nBut the problem specifically says: \"such that y_{t1+H-1}=9\".\n\nSo we must follow that.\n\nTherefore, the answer is H=8, and the sequence as above.\n\nBut let me confirm if we can avoid the extra action by being at 9 earlier? We cannot.\n\nAlternatively, we can be at 9 at turn 52? How? We start at 2 at turn 46. If we move faster? But we can only move one step per turn. So no.\n\nWe could take a detour? But that would take more turns. We want minimal H.\n\nSo 8 is minimal.\n\nBut in the sequence, we only moved up and then stayed at the end. And we avoided all cars.\n\nBut is there a problem at any turn? For example, at turn 52: we are at y=8. Then we do U to go to 9 at turn 53. But at turn 52, we are on freeway8? And we check freeway8 at turn 52: as above, safe.\n\nThen at turn 53, we are at y=9, not a freeway, so safe.\n\nSo the sequence is safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 46: U\nTurn 47: U\nTurn 48: U\nTurn 49: U\nTurn 50: U\nTurn 51: U\nTurn 52: U\nTurn 53: S\n}\n\nBut note: the turn labels: we start at turn 46 and go to turn 53? That's 8 actions.\n\nBut the problem says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" and so on.\n\nSo:\n\nTurn 46: U\nTurn 47: U\nTurn 48: U\nTurn 49: U\nTurn 50: U\nTurn 51: U\nTurn 52: U\nTurn 53: S\n\nBut is there a way to do it in 8 turns without the last S? For example, by staying once in the middle? But that would make us take 8 moves? Then we would arrive at turn 54? Which would require H=9? Worse.\n\nSo this is minimal.\n\nBut note: we are at y=2 at turn 46. If we do nothing for one turn? Then we stay at y=2 at turn 47. Then we go up. But that would take more turns.\n\nSo the above is the minimal.\n\nBut we must confirm the freeway at turn 53: we are at y=9, not a freeway, so no car collision.\n\nTherefore, the answer.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 2) at turn 46 in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\) while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\).\n\nThe minimal number of turns required is \\(H = 8\\). The sequence of actions consists of moving up (U) for the first 7 turns to increase the vertical position from 2 to 9, followed by a stay (S) action on the 8th turn to remain at \\(y = 9\\). This sequence ensures that the player reaches \\(y = 9\\) at the beginning of turn 53 (since \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 46 + 8 - 1 = 53\\)) and avoids all car collisions, as verified below:\n\n- **Turn 46 (y = 2)**: The car on freeway 2 at turn 46 is at [48, 83]. Since 0 is not in [48, 83], it is safe.\n- **Turn 47 (y = 3)**: The cars on freeway 3 at turn 47 are at [-47, -36], [37, 48], and [1, 12]. 0 is not in any span, so it is safe.\n- **Turn 48 (y = 4)**: The cars on freeway 4 at turn 48 are at [-35, -24], [49, 60], and [13, 24]. 0 is not in any span, so it is safe.\n- **Turn 49 (y = 5)**: The cars on freeway 5 at turn 49 are at [-23, -12], [61, 72], and [25, 36]. 0 is not in any span, so it is safe.\n- **Turn 50 (y = 6)**: The car on freeway 6 at turn 50 is at [19, 30]. 0 is not in [19, 30], so it is safe.\n- **Turn 51 (y = 7)**: The car on freeway 7 at turn 51 is at [25, 36]. 0 is not in [25, 36], so it is safe.\n- **Turn 52 (y = 8)**: The cars on freeway 8 at turn 52 are at [31, 42] and [-17, -6]. 0 is not in any span, so it is safe.\n- **Turn 53 (y = 9)**: Position \\(y = 9\\) is not a freeway (freeways are \\(y = 1\\) to \\(8\\)), so no collision check is needed. The stay action is safe.\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n\n\\boxed{\n\\text{Turn } 46: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 47: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 48: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 49: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 50: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 51: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 52: \\text{U} \\\\\n\\text{Turn } 53: \\text{S}\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at position (0, 3) at turn t_1 = 47. I need to get to (0, 9) in the fewest turns possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The vertical axis goes from 0 to 9, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, but y=1 to 8 have cars.\n\nThe player moves each turn with actions U (up, y+1), D (down, y-1), or S (stay, y same). y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nCars move on their freeways. For each car, given its head, tail, direction, and speed at turn t_1, I can find where it is at any future turn T.\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T (between 1 and 8) and 0 is within the span of a car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nImportantly, when you move to a new y, you are not on that freeway until the next turn. So if at turn T you are on y_T, and you move to y_{T+1}, you won't be on y_{T+1} until turn T+1, so cars on y_{T+1} at turn T don't affect you.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9, which is safe, in min H turns from t_1=47.\n\nCurrent position: (0,3) at t=47.\n\nI need to go from y=3 to y=9, so I need to move up 6 units. Since I can move up to 1 per turn, minimum possible H is 6 if I go straight up with no obstacles. But there are cars on y=1 to 8, so I might need to wait or go around, but since it's a vertical move only, no horizontal, I can only change y, so I have to pass through each freeway level.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there. Freeways are y=1 to y=8 only.\n\nTo go from y=3 to y=9, I need to be on y=4,5,6,7,8 at some points, and I need to avoid being there when a car covers position 0 on that row at that turn.\n\nPosition 0 is where the player is, I think. The grid is 2D, but player is always at x=0, I assume, since it says position (0, y), and cars are on the freeways, which are rows, and they have spans that might cover x=0.\n\nThe collision is if at turn T, y_T is between 1 and 8, and for that freeway k=y_T, there is a car whose span at T includes 0.\n\nSpan is given as head and tail, and direction indicates how it moves.\n\nLet me list all the cars at t_1=47 for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (head=12, tail=47, direction=left, speed=36)\n\nDirection left means it's moving left, so span at t_1 is [h, τ] = [12,47]? But head and tail, and direction.\n\nFor left-moving cars: span at t is [h, τ], and at T, it becomes [h - s*(T-t), τ - s*(T-t)]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: span at t is [τ, h], and at T, [τ + s*(T-t), h + s*(T-t)]\n\nIn the car state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor freeway 1: (12, 47, left, 36)\n\nSince left, at t_1, span is [head, tail] = [12,47]? But 12 to 47, and moving left.\n\nTypically, head might be the front, but in the span, for left-moving, [h, τ] with h < τ? 12 < 47, so [12,47], meaning from x=12 to x=47, and moving left, so decreasing x.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, [τ, h] with τ < h, so from τ to h, increasing.\n\nIn freeway 3, for example, there is a car (-36, -47, right, 12). τ=-47, h=-36? Since right-moving, span at t is [τ, h] = [-47, -36], I think, so from x=-47 to x=-36.\n\nAnd moving right, so increasing x.\n\nSimilarly, (48,37, right,12): τ=37, h=48? But for right-moving, it should be [τ, h] with τ < h, but here head=48, tail=37, 48>37, so if head is larger, but direction right, so span should be [tail, head] if tail < head.\n\nI think there might be inconsistency in notation.\n\nLook at the car update:\n\nFor left-moving: span(t) = [h, τ] → span(T) = [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nFor right-moving: span(t) = [τ, h] → span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nAnd in the input, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed)\n\nFor left-moving, at t, span is [h, τ], so if h and τ, with direction left, it implies that h is the left end or right end?\n\nIn [h, τ] for left-moving, and it moves left, so h and τ both decrease.\n\nBut in the values, for freeway 1: (12,47, left,36), so h=12, τ=47. Since left, span is [12,47], which from x=12 to x=47, so the car is between 12 and 47, and moving left, so at later time, the span shifts left.\n\nBut position 0 is at x=0, which is left of 12, so if the car is moving left, it might cover 0 at some point.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving, like in freeway 3: (-36,-47,right,12), head=-36, tail=-47, direction right.\n\nFor right-moving, span(t) = [τ, h] = [-47, -36], since τ=-47, h=-36, and -47 < -36, so [ -47, -36 ], from x=-47 to x=-36, moving right.\n\nThen at T, [ -47 + sΔT, -36 + sΔT ]\n\nSimilarly, another car on freeway 3: (48,37,right,12), head=48, tail=37, direction right, so τ=37, h=48, so span(t) = [37,48], moving right.\n\nAnd (12,1,right,12), head=12, tail=1, so τ=1, h=12, span [1,12], moving right.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nFreeway 4 and 5 have the same cars as freeway 3? No, freeway 4 has the same: (-36,-47,right,12), (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12)\n\nSimilarly freeway 5 same.\n\nFreeway 6: (12,1,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7: (12,1,right,6)\n\nFreeway 8: (12,1,right,6) and (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nFreeway 1 and 2 have only one car each: (12,47,left,36) for both.\n\nNow, I need to find for each freeway and for each future turn, whether position x=0 is covered by any car on that freeway.\n\nSince the player is always at x=0, we only care about whether 0 is in the span of some car on the freeway at that turn.\n\nFor a given freeway k and turn T, we need to check if for any car on k, 0 is between the left and right ends of its span at T.\n\nSince spans can be defined with min and max.\n\nFor a car, at time T, the span has a start and end.\n\nFor left-moving car: at T, span = [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], and since it's moving left, h - sΔT < τ - sΔT, so the left end is h - sΔT, right end is τ - sΔT.\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: span = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT], left end τ + sΔT, right end h + sΔT.\n\nThen 0 is covered if left_end <= 0 <= right_end.\n\nΔT = T - t_1 = T - 47.\n\nNow, t_1 = 47, so ΔT = T - 47.\n\nLet me denote dt = T - 47, so for turn T, dt = T - 47.\n\nAt turn T, for a car, the span depends on dt.\n\nI need to go from y=3 to y=9. I start at y=3 at turn 47.\n\nAt each turn, I choose action, which sets y for the next position.\n\nLet's think carefully about the timing.\n\nAt turn t, I am at position (0, y_t).\n\nI choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nThen at turn t+1, I am at (0, y_{t+1}).\n\nCollision is checked at each turn when I am on a freeway.\n\nSpecifically, at turn T, if y_T is between 1 and 8, then I am on freeway k=y_T, and I collide if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at that same turn T.\n\nThe note says: if I move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, I am not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so only considered on y_T at turn T.\n\nBut at turn T, I am on y_T, regardless of what I do, because I start the turn there.\n\nThe game dynamics say: collision occurs at turn T only if 0 is in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nWhen I choose a_t at turn t, it affects y_{t+1}, so at turn t, I am at y_t.\n\nFor example, at turn 47, I am at y=3.\n\nI choose a_{47}, which sets y_{48}.\n\nThen at turn 48, I am at y_{48}, and so on.\n\nCollision is at turn T based on y_T and the cars at T.\n\nTo reach y=9, I need to be at y=9 at some turn, say t_final.\n\nSince y=9 is not a freeway, no collision there.\n\nBut I need to pass through the freeways to get there.\n\nSince I start at y=3, I need to go through y=4,5,6,7,8 to reach y=9.\n\nI could stay or move down, but that might not help since I need to go up, so moving down would increase turns, so probably not optimal for min H.\n\nSimilarly, staying might be needed to avoid cars.\n\nBut min H is at least 6, if I can go straight up.\n\nFirst, let's check for each freeway and for turns around now, when x=0 is covered.\n\nI need to find for each y from 1 to 8, for which turns T, position 0 is occupied by a car on that row.\n\nThen, when I am on that row at turn T, I collide if 0 is covered at that turn.\n\nOtherwise, I am safe.\n\nSince the player moves one step at a time, and I start at y=3, I need to be on y=4, then y=5, etc., up to y=9.\n\nBut I can stay or move down, but moving down would make me go through more turns, so for min H, I should avoid unnecessary moves, so probably go up as much as possible, only stay or move down to avoid collision if needed.\n\nBut moving down might be useful to wait, but since the cars are moving, it might be better to wait at y=0 or y=9, but y=0 is below, I'm at y=3, so going down to y=0 might take extra turns.\n\nSimilarly, y=9 is safe, but I need to reach it.\n\nBut y=0 and y=9 are safe havens.\n\nSo perhaps I can go down to y=0 to wait, or up to y=9 directly if possible.\n\nBut since min H, going down might increase H.\n\nSimilarly, staying at a freeway when safe is possible, but I need to move up eventually.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, the times when 0 is covered.\n\nStart with freeway 1: y=1\n\nCars: only one: (head=12, tail=47, left, speed=36)\n\nLeft-moving, so at t_1=47, span = [h, τ] = [12,47]\n\nAt time T, span = [12 - 36*(T-47), 47 - 36*(T-47)]\n\nLet dt = T - 47, so span = [12 - 36 dt, 47 - 36 dt]\n\n0 is covered if 12 - 36 dt <= 0 <= 47 - 36 dt\n\nSince 47 - 36 dt > 12 - 36 dt always, so 0 is covered when 12 - 36 dt <= 0 and 0 <= 47 - 36 dt\n\nFirst inequality: 12 - 36 dt <= 0 => 12 <= 36 dt => dt >= 12/36 = 1/3\n\nSince dt integer, dt >= 1? 1/3, so for dt >= 1, 12 - 36 dt <= 12 - 36 = -24 <=0, true for dt >=1.\n\ndt >= ceil(1/3) =1, since dt integer.\n\n12 - 36 dt <=0 for dt >= 12/36 =1/3, so since dt >=0, for dt=0, 12 -0 =12 >0, not <=0.\n\nFor dt=0, 12 -0 =12, 47-0=47, 0 not in [12,47] since 0<12.\n\nFor dt=1, 12-36= -24, 47-36=11, so span [-24,11], 0 is between -24 and 11, yes covered.\n\nSecond inequality: 0 <= 47 - 36 dt\n\n47 - 36 dt >=0 => 36 dt <=47 => dt <= 47/36 ≈ 1.305, so dt <=1 since integer.\n\ndt <= floor(47/36) = floor(1.305) =1\n\nFor dt=1, 47-36=11>=0, true.\n\nFor dt=2, 47-72= -25 <0, not >=0.\n\nSo 0 covered when both: dt >=1 and dt <=1, so only at dt=1, i.e., T=47 +1 =48.\n\nAt turn T=48, for freeway 1, 0 is covered.\n\nFor other dt, not covered.\n\nFor dt=0, T=47, span [12,47], 0 not in.\n\ndt=1, T=48, span [-24,11], 0 in.\n\ndt=2, T=49, span [12-72,47-72]=[-60,-25], 0 not in, since -60 to -25, 0> -25? -25 to -60, all negative, 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for larger |dt|, not covered.\n\nSo for freeway 1, 0 is covered only at turn 48.\n\nNow freeway 2: same as freeway 1, since same car: (12,47,left,36)\n\nSo also only at T=48, 0 covered.\n\nNow freeway 3: y=3\n\nCars: three cars\n\nFirst: (-36,-47,right,12)  head=-36, tail=-47, direction right.\n\nRight-moving, so at t_1, span = [τ, h] = [-47, -36] since τ=-47, h=-36, and τ < h? -47 < -36, yes, so span [-47, -36]\n\nAt T, span = [ -47 + 12 dt, -36 + 12 dt ]\n\n0 covered if -47 +12 dt <= 0 <= -36 +12 dt\n\nFirst, -47 +12 dt <= 0 => 12 dt <= 47 => dt <= 47/12 ≈ 3.916, so dt <=3\n\nSecond, 0 <= -36 +12 dt => 12 dt >=36 => dt >= 3\n\nSo both: dt >=3 and dt <=3, so only at dt=3, T=47+3=50\n\nAt dt=3, span: -47+36= -11, -36+36=0, so [-11,0], 0 is included, covered.\n\nFor other dt, not.\n\nSecond car on freeway 3: (48,37,right,12) head=48, tail=37, direction right.\n\nτ=37, h=48, span at t_1: [37,48]\n\nAt T: [37 +12 dt, 48 +12 dt]\n\n0 covered if 37+12 dt <=0 <=48+12 dt\n\nBut 37+12 dt >=37>0, so left end >=37>0, so 0 not <= left end? 0 <= left end only if left end <=0, but left end min is 37>0, so never <=0, so 0 cannot be <= left end since left end >=37>0. So 0 not covered by this car for any dt.\n\nSimilarly, third car: (12,1,right,12) head=12, tail=1, τ=1, h=12, span at t_1: [1,12]\n\nAt T: [1 +12 dt, 12 +12 dt]\n\nLeft end min 1>0, so always >0, so 0 not covered.\n\nThus for freeway 3, only the first car covers 0 at T=50.\n\nNow freeway 4: same as freeway 3, cars: (-36,-47,right,12), (48,37,right,12), (12,1,right,12)\n\nSame as above, only (-36,-47,right,12) covers 0 at T=50.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 5: same, only covered at T=50.\n\nNow freeway 6: y=6\n\nCars: one car (12,1,right,6)\n\nhead=12, tail=1, right, speed=6\n\nτ=1, h=12, span at t_1: [1,12]\n\nAt T: [1 +6 dt, 12 +6 dt]\n\nLeft end min 1>0, so 0 not covered for any dt.\n\nThus freeway 6 is always safe? 0 never covered.\n\n[1+6dt,12+6dt], for dt>=0, min left is 1>0, so 0 not in [left,right] since left>0.\n\nSimilarly for larger dt, left larger.\n\nSo yes, freeway 6 never has a car covering x=0.\n\nNow freeway 7: same, (12,1,right,6), same as above, never covered.\n\nNow freeway 8: y=8\n\nCars: (12,1,right,6) and (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nFirst car: (12,1,right,6), same as above, never covers 0.\n\nSecond car: (-36,-47,right,6) head=-36, tail=-47, direction right.\n\nτ=-47, h=-36, span at t_1: [-47, -36]\n\nAt T: [ -47 +6 dt, -36 +6 dt ]\n\n0 covered if -47 +6 dt <= 0 <= -36 +6 dt\n\nFirst: -47 +6 dt <=0 => 6 dt <=47 => dt <= 47/6 ≈7.833, dt<=7\n\nSecond: 0 <= -36 +6 dt => 6 dt >=36 => dt >=6\n\nSo both: dt >=6 and dt <=7\n\nFor dt=6: span: -47+36= -11, -36+36=0, so [-11,0], 0 included.\n\ndt=7: -47+42= -5, -36+42=6, so [-5,6], 0 in.\n\ndt=8: -47+48=1, -36+48=12, [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo covered at dt=6 and dt=7, i.e., T=47+6=53 and T=47+7=54.\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, when 0 is covered (unsafe):\n\ny=1: unsafe at T=48\n\ny=2: unsafe at T=48 (since same as y=1)\n\ny=3: unsafe at T=50\n\ny=4: unsafe at T=50 (same as y=3)\n\ny=5: unsafe at T=50 (same)\n\ny=6: always safe\n\ny=7: always safe\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=53 and T=54\n\ny=6 and y=7 are always safe, no cars cover x=0.\n\ny=1 and y=2 unsafe only at T=48\n\ny=3,4,5 unsafe only at T=50\n\ny=8 unsafe at T=53 and 54\n\nNow, I start at turn 47, y=3.\n\nAt turn 47, y=3, which is freeway 3.\n\nIs it safe at turn 47?\n\nFor y=3 at turn 47: we need to check if 0 covered.\n\nAt dt=0, T=47, for freeway 3, we have cars.\n\nFirst car: (-36,-47,right,12), at dt=0, span [-47,-36], 0 not in.\n\nSecond: [37,48], not.\n\nThird: [1,12], not.\n\nSo 0 not covered at T=47, so safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=6 and y=7 always safe.\n\nNow, I need to reach y=9.\n\nSince min turns, I should go up as fast as possible, but avoid being on unsafe freeway at unsafe times.\n\nStart at t=47, y=3, safe.\n\nI need to go to y=4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut y=9 is safe.\n\nNow, unsafe times:\n\n- If I am on y=1 or y=2 at T=48, unsafe.\n\n- On y=3,4,5 at T=50, unsafe.\n\n- On y=8 at T=53 or 54, unsafe.\n\nOther times and other freeways are safe.\n\ny=6 and y=7 always safe.\n\nI start at y=3 at t=47.\n\nI can choose to go up, down, or stay.\n\nIf I go up at t=47, to y=4 at t=48.\n\nAt t=48, y=4.\n\nNow y=4 at t=48: is it safe?\n\ny=4 is freeway, and at t=48, dt=1, T=48.\n\nFor y=4, unsafe only at T=50, not at T=48.\n\nAt T=48, for y=4, cars same as y=3? Freeway 4 has cars, but we need to check at T=48.\n\nAt dt=1, T=48.\n\nFor freeway 4, first car: (-36,-47,right,12), span at T: [-47 +12(1), -36 +12(1)] = [-47+12, -36+12] = [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [37+12,48+12]=[49,60], not.\n\nThird: [1+12,12+12]=[13,24], not.\n\nSo 0 not covered, safe.\n\nSimilarly, y=1 and y=2 unsafe at t=48, but y=4 is safe at t=48.\n\nNow, if I go up to y=4 at t=48.\n\nThen at t=48, I am at y=4, safe.\n\nNow I can go up to y=5 at t=49.\n\nAt t=49, y=5.\n\ny=5 at t=49: dt=2, T=49.\n\nFreeway 5, same cars.\n\nAt dt=2, first car: [-47+24, -36+24] = [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond: [37+24,48+24]=[61,72], not.\n\nThird: [1+24,12+24]=[25,36], not.\n\nSafe.\n\nThen go up to y=6 at t=50.\n\nAt t=50, y=6.\n\ny=6 is freeway 6, which is always safe, as we said.\n\nAt t=50, y=6, no car covers 0, so safe.\n\nThen I can go up to y=7 at t=51.\n\ny=7 always safe, so at t=51, y=7, safe.\n\nThen to y=8 at t=52.\n\nAt t=52, y=8.\n\ny=8 at t=52: is it safe?\n\ny=8 unsafe at T=53 and 54, not at 52.\n\nAt t=52, dt=5, T=52.\n\nCars on y=8: (12,1,right,6) and (-36,-47,right,6)\n\nFirst car: (12,1,right,6), at dt=5, span [1+30, 12+30] = [31,42], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: (-36,-47,right,6), at dt=5, span [-47+30, -36+30] = [-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nSo safe.\n\nThen from y=8, I can go up to y=9 at t=53.\n\nAt t=53, I move to y=9, but at turn t=53, I am at y=8 until I move.\n\nLet's sequence the turns.\n\nAt turn t=52, I am at y=52? Positions.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nAfter action at T, y_{T+1} set.\n\nStart: at turn 47, y=3.\n\nI choose action a_47.\n\nIf a_47 = U, then y_{48} = y_47 +1 =4\n\nIf D, y=2, etc.\n\nAt turn 47, I am at y=3, and I choose action which sets y for next turn.\n\nThen at turn 48, I am at y_48, and so on.\n\nCollision at turn T based on y_T and cars at T.\n\nIn the sequence above:\n\nt=47: y=3, safe as we saw.\n\nI choose a_47 = U, so y_{48} =4\n\nNow at turn t=48: I am at y=4, which is safe, as we checked for T=48, y=4 safe.\n\nThen at t=48, I choose a_48 = U, so y_{49} =5\n\nAt turn t=49: y=5, which at T=49, y=5 safe, as above.\n\nThen choose a_49 = U, y_{50} =6\n\nAt turn t=50: y=6, which is always safe, so safe.\n\nThen choose a_50 = U, y_{51} =7\n\nAt t=51: y=7, always safe, safe.\n\nChoose a_51 = U, y_{52} =8\n\nAt t=52: y=8, at T=52, safe as above.\n\nThen choose a_52 = U, y_{53} =9\n\nNow at turn t=53: I am at y=8 (since I start the turn there), and I choose action to go to y=9.\n\nBut at turn t=53, y_T=8, and T=53, which is unsafe for y=8.\n\ny=8 unsafe at T=53 and 54.\n\nAt T=53, dt=6, y=8.\n\nCars: second car (-36,-47,right,6), at dt=6, span [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0], so 0 is included, covered.\n\nThus, at turn t=53, if I am on y=8, I collide.\n\nIn this sequence, at t=53, I am on y=8, and it is unsafe, so collision.\n\nProblem.\n\nSo I cannot be on y=8 at t=53.\n\nIn my sequence, I arrived at y=8 at t=52, which is safe, but then at t=52, I move to y=9 at t=53? No.\n\nAt turn t=52: I am at y=52? y_t.\n\nAt turn t=52, position y_{52} =8.\n\nI choose action a_{52}, which sets y_{53}.\n\nIf I choose U, then y_{53} =9.\n\nBut at turn t=53, when I am at y_{53}, but at the beginning of turn t=53, I am at y_{53}, which is set at the end of previous action? No.\n\nTiming:\n\nAt turn T, I start at position y_T.\n\nThen I choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nThen I move to y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nCollision is checked at turn T based on y_T and the cars at that turn.\n\nIn this case, at turn t=53, y_{53} is the position.\n\nIn the sequence:\n\nAfter a_52 at t=52, y_{53} is set to 9 if a_52=U.\n\nThen at turn t=53, I start at y_{53}=9.\n\nBut y=9 is not a freeway, so no collision.\n\nBut at turn t=53, when I am at y_{53}=9, I am not on a freeway, so no collision check, or it is safe.\n\nThe collision only if on freeway y=1 to 8.\n\nSo at t=53, if I am at y=9, I am safe.\n\nBut in the earlier point, at turn t=53, if I were at y=8, I collide.\n\nIn my sequence, I want to be at y=9 at t=53.\n\nHow?\n\nFrom t=52, y=8.\n\nAt t=52, I choose a_{52}=U, so y_{53} = y_{52} +1 =8+1=9.\n\nThen at turn t=53, I am at y=9, which is safe.\n\nAt turn t=52, I was at y=8, which was safe.\n\nIn this case, I am not on y=8 at t=53.\n\nThe issue is at t=53, if I were on y=8.\n\nBut in this action, I move to y=9 at t=53.\n\nSo at turn t=53, position is y=9, not on freeway.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nBut earlier I thought about being on y=8 at t=53.\n\nIn the sequence I described:\n\nt=47: y=3, choose U, set y_{48}=4\n\nt=48: y=4, choose U, set y_{49}=5\n\nt=49: y=5, choose U, set y_{50}=6\n\nt=50: y=6, choose U, set y_{51}=7\n\nt=51: y=7, choose U, set y_{52}=8\n\nt=52: y=8, choose U, set y_{53}=9\n\nt=53: y=9, reached.\n\nNow, check collisions:\n\nAt t=47: y=3, safe\n\nt=48: y=4, safe (as we saw)\n\nt=49: y=5, safe\n\nt=50: y=6, safe\n\nt=51: y=7, safe\n\nt=52: y=8, at T=52, safe (as above)\n\nt=53: y=9, not freeway, safe.\n\nAnd I reached at turn t=53, which is H=7 turns? From t=47 to t=53, that's 7 turns: t=47,48,49,50,51,52,53.\n\nBut at t=47 I start, and after H actions, I should be at y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns from t_1, so after H turns, at turn t_1 + H -1 or something.\n\nLet's clarify the indexing.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nAt turn t_1, I take action a_{t_1}, which affects y_{t_1 +1}.\n\nThen at turn t_1 +1, I am at y_{t_1 +1}, and so on.\n\nAfter H actions, I should be at y_{t_1 + H} =9? No.\n\nStart at turn t_1, position given.\n\nAfter first action, at turn t_1 +1, position y_{t_1 +1}\n\n...\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t_1 + k, position y_{t_1 + k}\n\nI need y_{t_1 + k} =9 for some k.\n\nThe minimal H such that after H actions, I reach y=9.\n\nAfter H actions, I have taken actions at t_1, t_1+1, ..., t_1 + H -1, and I am at turn t_1 + H with position y_{t_1 + H}.\n\nI need y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nAnd H minimal.\n\nIn this case, start at t_1=47, y=3.\n\nIf I go up each turn:\n\nAfter 0 actions, at t=47, y=3\n\nAfter 1 action (a_47), at t=48, y=4\n\nAfter 2 actions, t=49, y=5\n\nAfter 3, t=50, y=6\n\nAfter 4, t=51, y=7\n\nAfter 5, t=52, y=8\n\nAfter 6 actions, t=53, y=9\n\nSo with H=6 actions, I reach y=9 at t=53.\n\nAnd from above, all positions during: t=47 to t=52 are safe? t=47 to t=52 I am on freeways at some points, but we checked all safe.\n\nAt t=47: y=3, safe\n\nt=48: y=4, safe\n\nt=49: y=5, safe\n\nt=50: y=6, safe\n\nt=51: y=7, safe\n\nt=52: y=8, safe\n\nAnd at t=53, y=9, not freeway.\n\nBut y=8 at t=52 is safe, and I move to y=9 at t=53.\n\nNow, is there a problem at t=53? No, I'm at y=9.\n\nBut earlier I thought y=8 unsafe at t=53, but I'm not on it at t=53.\n\nIn this sequence, I am on y=8 only at t=52, which is safe.\n\nt=53 I am on y=9.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nBut let me confirm the unsafe times.\n\ny=8 unsafe at t=53 and t=54.\n\nBut in this path, I am not on y=8 at those times.\n\nSimilarly, other unsafe times: y=1,2 unsafe at t=48, but I am on y=4 at t=48, not on y=1 or 2.\n\ny=3,4,5 unsafe at t=50, at t=50 I am on y=6, which is safe.\n\nSo all good.\n\nWith H=6 actions: actions at t=47 to t=52.\n\nActions: a_47 to a_52, each U.\n\nThen at t=53, y=9.\n\nSequence: from t=47 to t=52, 6 actions.\n\nH=6.\n\nIs this minimal? Since I need to go up 6 steps, and I did without delay, so yes, H=6 should be minimal.\n\nBut let me make sure about the car at t=50 for y=3,4,5.\n\nAt t=50, y=3,4,5 are unsafe, but I am on y=6 at t=50, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly, at t=48, y=1 and 2 unsafe, but I am on y=4.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut in the car list, freeway 3 has cars, but at t=50, it is unsafe, but I'm not there.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut I start at y=3 at t=47, which is safe.\n\nNow, but the player position is at x=0, and cars, but we covered.\n\nPerhaps I can do it faster? But from y=3 to y=9, need at least 6 moves up, so H=6 is minimum possible.\n\nWith staying or down, it would take more turns, so not better.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nBut let me write the actions.\n\nt_1=47.\n\nActions:\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nThen y_{48}=4\n\nTurn 48: U, y_{49}=5\n\nTurn 49: U, y_{50}=6\n\nTurn 50: U, y_{51}=7\n\nTurn 51: U, y_{52}=8\n\nTurn 52: U, y_{53}=9\n\nReached at t=53.\n\nNumber of actions: from t=47 to t=52, 6 actions.\n\nH=6.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1 + H -1 =47 +6 -1=52, yes.\n\nSequence: a_{47} to a_{52}, all U.\n\nBut let me confirm if at any point I might be unsafe.\n\nAnother thing: when I move, the note about not being on the new freeway until next turn, but in this case, it doesn't affect because I'm not crossing during unsafe times in a way that causes issue.\n\nFor example, at turn t=50, I am on y=6, safe, and I move to y=7, but at turn t=50, I am on y=6, and y=7 cars don't affect me since I'm not on it yet.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nPerhaps I should output the sequence.\n\nBut in the car state, freeway 8 has a car that covers at t=53, but I'm not on it.\n\nBut in this path, I don't go to y=8 at t=53.\n\nPerhaps I can reach earlier? But from y=3 to y=9, min 6 moves, so no.\n\nStart at t=47, y=3.\n\nAfter 1 move, t=48, y=4\n\n...\n\nAfter 6 moves, t=53, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut is t=53 the turn when I reach? Yes.\n\nH=6.\n\nBut let me see the initial position: at turn t_1=47, position (0,3), so y=3.\n\nAfter actions, I reach y=9 at turn t_1 + H.\n\nt_1 + H =47 +6=53.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps I can do with H=5? But from y=3 to y=9, difference 6, each move changes y by at most 1, so min 6 actions needed. If I start at y=3, after 5 actions, y could be at most 8, so not 9. After 5 actions, y =3 + number of U minus number of D, but since I need to increase by 6, min 6 U with no D or S, so H=6 min.\n\nThus, this should be the solution.\n\nBut in the sequence, all actions U.\n\nBut let me write it in the answer format.\n\nSo for turn 47: a_{47} = U\n\nTurn 48: a_{48} = U\n\nTurn 49: a_{49} = U\n\nTurn 50: a_{50} = U\n\nTurn 51: a_{51} = U\n\nTurn 52: a_{52} = U\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nH=6.\n\nBut the player reaches at turn 53, but the actions are up to turn 52.\n\nIn the sequence, turn t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nt_1=47, H=6, so turns 47 to 52.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but I recall that for freeway 8, at t=53 and 54 it is unsafe, but I avoid it.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider if I stay or something, but not necessary.\n\nAnother thing: at the beginning, I am at y=3, which is freeway, but safe at t=47.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut let me double-check freeway 6 and 7.\n\ny=6: freeway 6, cars: (12,1,right,6), span [1+6dt,12+6dt], always min left >=1>0, so 0 not covered, safe.\n\nSimilarly y=7: same car type, safe.\n\ny=8: at t=52, dt=5, span for (-36,-47,right,6): [-47+30, -36+30]=[-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nOther car [1+30,12+30]=[31,42], not.\n\nSafe.\n\nAt t=53, if I were on y=8, unsafe, but I'm not.\n\nSo all good.\n\nTherefore, minimal H=6 with all up actions.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\nTurn 47: U\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nNow in the answer format.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions\"\n\nH=6.\n\nSequence as above.\n\nBut let me write it in the box.\n\nAlso, in the car state, freeway 3 has multiple cars, but we covered.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if going down to avoid, but no need.\n\nAnother path: suppose I stay at y=3 for one turn, but then I would need more actions to go up, so H larger, not minimal.\n\nSimilarly, if I go down to y=0, even worse.\n\nSo this is optimal.\n\nThus, the answer.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 3)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 47\\) is 6. The sequence of actions consists of moving up (U) at each turn from turn 47 to turn 52, resulting in the player reaching y=9 at turn 53.\n\n### Verification of the Path:\n- **Turn 47 (y=3)**: Position is safe, as no car on freeway y=3 covers x=0 at turn 47.\n- **Turn 48 (y=4)**: Position is safe, as no car on freeway y=4 covers x=0 at turn 48 (unsafe only at turn 50).\n- **Turn 49 (y=5)**: Position is safe, as no car on freeway y=5 covers x=0 at turn 49 (unsafe only at turn 50).\n- **Turn 50 (y=6)**: Position is safe, as freeway y=6 is always safe (no car covers x=0 at any turn).\n- **Turn 51 (y=7)**: Position is safe, as freeway y=7 is always safe (no car covers x=0 at any turn).\n- **Turn 52 (y=8)**: Position is safe, as no car on freeway y=8 covers x=0 at turn 52 (unsafe at turns 53 and 54).\n- **Turn 53 (y=9)**: Position (0,9) is reached, which is not a freeway and thus safe.\n\n### Why this is minimal:\n- The player starts at y=3 and needs to reach y=9, requiring a minimum of 6 upward moves (each increasing y by 1).\n- No shorter sequence is possible, as fewer than 6 actions cannot achieve a net increase of 6 in y-position.\n- Alternative actions (e.g., staying or moving down) would increase \\(H\\) beyond 6 and are unnecessary since this path avoids all collisions.\n\n### Action Sequence:\nThe actions are taken from turn \\(t_1 = 47\\) to turn \\(t_1 + H - 1 = 47 + 6 - 1 = 52\\).\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 47: U \\\\\nTurn 48: U \\\\\nTurn 49: U \\\\\nTurn 50: U \\\\\nTurn 51: U \\\\\nTurn 52: U\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get the player from (0,4) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 48.\n\nThe player can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S), changing y by +1, -1, or 0, but y must stay between 0 and 9. Since we start at y=4 and need to go to y=9, we need to move up overall, so actions should mostly be U, but we have to avoid the cars.\n\nCollision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car where 0 is in its span at that turn. The span changes linearly with time based on speed and direction.\n\nAlso, when moving, at turn T, if you move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T, you're not considered on y_{T+1} until the next turn, so you only check the car on your current y_T for collision.\n\nNow, let's list the car states for each freeway at turn t_1=48.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, head -24, tail 11, left direction, speed 36. Since it's left-moving, span at time T is [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]? No, from the update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)] but head and tail, I need to know which is which. From the rule:\n\nFor left-moving, span at t_1 is [h, τ], and since it's moving left, at T, it's [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)].\n\nIn the state, it's given as (head, tail, direction, speed). For left-moving, head should be the front, which is on the left if moving left? I think I need to interpret the coordinates.\n\nThe x-coordinate is the position, and 0 is the point we care about for collision. The grid is 2D, but player is at (0,y), so we only care about x=0 for collision.\n\nCars are on lanes y=1 to 8, and we care if at turn T, when player is on y, then for that y, if there is a car with 0 in its span at that turn.\n\nSpan is the interval covered by the car.\n\nFor freeway 1: car (h, τ, d, s) = (-24, 11, left, 36)\n\nSince left-moving, at time t, span is [h - s(t - t_1), τ - s(t - t_1)]? t_1 is 48.\n\nGenerally, for any car, at turn T, the span depends on direction.\n\nFor left-moving car: initial span at t_1 is [h, τ], with h and τ such that since moving left, h should be the right end and τ the left end? I need to clarify.\n\nThe description says: \"for car k, head at h, tail at τ at turn t_1\"\n\nThen for left-moving: \"Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\"\n\nIn this notation, [h, τ] might not be ordered; it could be that h and τ are such that h is the position of the head.\n\nBut in the collision, we care about the interval, so [min, max] or what?\n\nFor left-moving, if it's moving left, the head is decreasing, so if at t_1, head is at h, tail at τ, and since moving left, head is on the right, tail on the left? Let's see the values.\n\nFor freeway 1: head -24, tail 11, left direction. -24 and 11, -24 < 11, so if head is at -24 and tail at 11, that would mean the car is from -24 to 11, but moving left, which would make sense if head is the front, so if moving left, front is decreasing, so head at smaller x.\n\nBut typically, head is the front. So for left-moving, front is at smaller x, so head h is less than tail τ if tail is the back.\n\nI think there's ambiguity. Let me look at the span update.\n\nIn the update rule, for left-moving: Span(T) = [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nAnd at T=t_1, it should be [h, τ], so the interval is from h to τ.\n\nIn freeway 1, h=-24, τ=11, so at t_1, span is [-24, 11], which includes 0 since -24 <= 0 <= 11.\n\nSimilarly, for collision, we care if 0 is in Span(T) for the car on that freeway.\n\nNow for freeway 1 at t_1: span [-24,11], which contains 0, so if player is on freeway 1 at turn 48, there would be collision, but player is at y=4, not on freeway 1, so no issue at start.\n\nPlayer starts at (0,4), so at turn 48, player is on y=4.\n\nNow we need to go to y=9.\n\nFreeway 9 is not a freeway? Freeways are y=1 to 8, and player needs to reach (0,9), which is above, so y=9 has no cars, I assume, since freeways only 1-8.\n\nThe goal is (0,9), and freeways are y=1 to 8 for cars, so y=0 and y=9 should be safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 is the bottom, y=9 top, both no cars.\n\nPlayer can be on y=0 or y=9 without car collision.\n\nNow, let's list all cars for each freeway at t_1=48.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: (-24, 11, left, 36)\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1? It says \"(-24,11,left,36)\" for both? No, for freeway 2 it's also \"(-24,11,left,36)\"? Let me check.\n\nIn the table:\n\nFreeway 1: (-24,11,left,36)\n\nFreeway 2: (-24,11,left,36) — same as 1?\n\nBut it's a different freeway, so cars are per freeway.\n\nFor freeway 3,4,5 there are multiple cars.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: (-24,-35,right,12), (60,49,right,12), (24,13,right,12)\n\nSimilarly for 4 and 5.\n\nFreeway 6: (18,7,right,6)\n\nFreeway 7: (18,7,right,6)\n\nFreeway 8: (18,7,right,6), (-30,-41,right,6)\n\nFirst, I need to find for each freeway and each future turn, when is there a car that has 0 in its span, so that if player is on that freeway at that turn, collision occurs.\n\nSince the player moves one y per turn, we need to plan a path through the y-levels over time.\n\nPlayer starts at y=4 at turn 48.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nEach action changes y by -1,0, or +1, so we can stay or move up/down.\n\nSince we need to go up, moving down might not be efficient, but sometimes necessary to avoid cars.\n\nMinimal turns: since from 4 to 9, difference is 5, so minimum 5 turns if we only go up, but we might need to wait or detour if there are collisions.\n\nFirst, let's compute for each freeway and for turns around t=48, when 0 is occupied by a car.\n\nLet t be the turn number, with t=48 being current.\n\nFor a given freeway k, at turn t, is there a collision possible? That is, is 0 in some car's span on k at t.\n\nFor each car on k, we can compute its span at t.\n\nt relative to t_1=48.\n\nSet τ = t - t_1, so τ=0 at current turn.\n\nThen for a car with initial head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s at τ=0.\n\nThen at time τ (after t_1), span depends on direction.\n\nIf d = left, span at τ: [h - s*τ, τ - s*τ] where τ is tail, but I used τ for time, bad notation.\n\nUse Δt for time elapsed since t_1, so Δt = t - t_1.\n\nAt time Δt, for left-moving car: span = [h - s * Δt, tail - s * Δt]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: for right-moving, the rule says: Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]? From the description:\n\n\"Right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + s (T-t_1), h + s (T-t_1)]\"\n\nAnd at t_1, Span is [τ, h], so for right-moving, τ and h are such that τ is tail, h is head, and since moving right, head has higher x, so τ < h typically.\n\nIn the state, for example, freeway 3: (-24,-35,right,12), so at t_1, Span = [τ, h] = [-35, -24]? τ=-35, h=-24, so [ -35, -24 ].\n\nSimilarly, (60,49,right,12), τ=49, h=60? But 49>60? That can't be, probably it's (head, tail), so for right-moving, if head is larger, then in (60,49), if head=60, tail=49, then [τ,h] = [49,60] for the span.\n\nI think there's inconsistency in notation.\n\nLet's read carefully the car state: \"Cars (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\"\n\nAnd for direction, for right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], which implies that τ is the left end and h is the right end, so for right-moving, h > τ.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving, Span(t_1) = [h, τ], which could have h < τ or h > τ, but in the example freeway 1: (-24,11,left), h=-24, τ=11, so [h,τ] = [-24,11], so h < τ, meaning head is left, tail is right.\n\nIn general, for a car, the span at t_1 is from min to max of h and τ, but the direction tells how it moves.\n\nFor collision, we care about the interval, so at time t, the span is an interval, and we check if 0 is in it.\n\nSo for each car, given (h, τ, d, s), at time Δt after t_1, the span is:\n\nIf d = left: the span moves left, so positions decrease.\n\nInitial min and max: since [h,τ], but h and τ could be in any order, but the interval is from min(h,τ) to max(h,τ) at t_1, I think.\n\nIn freeway 1, h=-24, τ=11, min=-24, max=11.\n\nThen at Δt, for left-moving, both ends decrease by s*Δt, so span [min(h,τ) - s*Δt, max(h,τ) - s*Δt]\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, both increase by s*Δt, so span [min(h,τ) + s*Δt, max(h,τ) + s*Δt]\n\nIn the rule, for right-moving, it says Span(T) = [τ + s*Δt, h + s*Δt], which with τ and h, but in the state, for right-moving freeway 3: (-24,-35,right,12), so τ=-35, h=-24, so min=-35, max=-24, then at Δt, span [min + s*Δt, max + s*Δt] = [-35 +12Δt, -24 +12Δt]\n\nSimilarly, for (60,49,right,12), if head=60, tail=49, min=49, max=60, so span [49 +12Δt, 60 +12Δt]\n\nBut 49+12Δt to 60+12Δt, which is increasing.\n\nSimilarly for (24,13,right,12), min=13, max=24, span [13+12Δt, 24+12Δt]\n\nFor left-moving, like freeway 1: (-24,11,left,36), min=-24, max=11, span [min - s*Δt, max - s*Δt] = [-24 -36Δt, 11 -36Δt]\n\nNow, 0 is in the span if min_end <= 0 <= max_end for the interval.\n\nFor each freeway, at time Δt, if there is any car on that freeway with 0 in its span, then collision if player is on that y at turn t= t_1 + Δt.\n\nSince we start at Δt=0, t=48.\n\nNow let's list for each freeway the cars and their span functions.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, left, s=36, min_hτ = min(-24,11) = -24, max_hτ = max(-24,11) =11, so span at Δt: [ -24 -36Δt, 11 -36Δt ]\n\n0 in span if -24 -36Δt <= 0 <= 11 -36Δt\n\nSince the interval is decreasing, let's solve:\n\nLeft inequality: -24 -36Δt <= 0 => -36Δt <= 24 => Δt >= -24/36 = -2/3, but Δt >=0, so always true for Δt >=0? -24 -36Δt <=0 when -36Δt <=24, since Δt>=0, -36Δt <=0 <=24, so always true? Let's see:\n\n-24 -36Δt <= 0 is true when -36Δt <= 24, multiply by -1, 36Δt >= -24, which is true since Δt>=0.\n\nBut the inequality is min <=0, which is -24 -36Δt <=0.\n\n-24 -36Δt <=0 implies -36Δt <=24, then multiplying by -1 (reverse inequality), 36Δt >= -24, which is true for all Δt since 36Δt >=0 > -24.\n\nSimilarly, 0 <= max, 0 <= 11 -36Δt, which implies 36Δt <=11, Δt <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305\n\nAlso, min <=0 <= max, so we need both min <=0 and 0<= max.\n\nmin <=0: -24 -36Δt <=0, which is always true for Δt >=0 as above.\n\n0 <= max: 0 <= 11 -36Δt, so 36Δt <=11, Δt <= 11/36\n\nAlso, since min <= max always, but here min = -24-36Δt, max=11-36Δt, min < max since -24<11.\n\nSo 0 in span only if 0 <= 11-36Δt, i.e., Δt <= 11/36 ≈ 0.305\n\nSince Δt integer (turns), Δt=0: at Δt=0, span [-24,11], 0 in it.\n\nΔt=1: span [-24-36, 11-36] = [-60, -25], min=-60, max=-25, 0 not in [-60,-25]\n\nFor Δt=0, 0 in span; for Δt>=1, 0 not in span.\n\nΔt=0: t=48, span [-24,11], 0 in it.\n\nΔt=1: t=49, span [-24-36,11-36] = [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSimilarly for higher Δt.\n\nSo for freeway 1, collision only at Δt=0, i.e., turn 48.\n\nBut player is not on freeway 1 at turn 48, so no issue for later turns on freeway 1.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1, car (-24,11,left,36), so same thing, collision only at Δt=0, turn 48.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars, all right-moving, s=12.\n\nFirst car: (-24,-35,right,12) — head=-24, tail=-35? For right-moving, span at t_1 is [τ, h], but in state it's (head, tail), so for this car, head=-24, tail=-35, so since right-moving, min=min(-24,-35)= -35, max=max(-24,-35)= -24, so at Δt, span [min + s Δt, max + s Δt] = [-35 + 12 Δt, -24 + 12 Δt]\n\n0 in span if -35 +12 Δt <= 0 <= -24 +12 Δt\n\nSolve:\n\nLeft: -35 +12Δt <= 0 => 12Δt <= 35 => Δt <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916\n\nRight: 0 <= -24 +12Δt => 24 <= 12Δt => Δt >= 2\n\nSo for Δt >=2 and Δt <= 2.916, so integer Δt=2? Δt=2: -35+24= -11, -24+24=0, so span [-11,0], 0 in it? 0 <=0 <=0, yes, 0 is included.\n\nmin <=0 <= max, at Δt=2, min=-35+24= -11, max=-24+24=0, so [ -11, 0], 0 <=0, so yes, 0 in span.\n\nΔt=3: min=-35+36=1, max=-24+36=12, span [1,12], 0 not in [1,12].\n\nΔt=1: min=-35+12= -23, max=-24+12= -12, span [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSo only at Δt=2, t=50, 0 in span for this car.\n\nSecond car on freeway 3: (60,49,right,12) — head=60, tail=49, right-moving.\n\nmin=min(60,49)=49, max=max(60,49)=60, span at Δt [49 +12Δt, 60 +12Δt]\n\n0 in span? 49+12Δt <=0 <=60+12Δt? But 49+12Δt >=49>0 for Δt>=0, so min >=49>0, so 0 not in span ever.\n\nSimilarly, third car: (24,13,right,12) — head=24, tail=13, min=13, max=24, span [13+12Δt, 24+12Δt] >=13>0, so 0 not in span.\n\nSo for freeway 3, only the first car has 0 in span at Δt=2, so collision possible only at t=50 (Δt=2).\n\nNow freeway 4: same as freeway 3? \"(-24,-35,right,12), (60,49,right,12), (24,13,right,12)\" same as freeway 3.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 5 same.\n\nSo freeways 3,4,5 all have the same car setup, so each has collision only at t=50.\n\nNow freeway 6: one car (18,7,right,6) — head=18, tail=7, right-moving.\n\nmin=min(18,7)=7, max=18, span at Δt [7+6Δt, 18+6Δt]\n\n0 in span? 7+6Δt <=0 <=18+6Δt? Left: 7+6Δt <=0? 6Δt <= -7, impossible for Δt>=0. So min=7+6Δt >=7>0, so 0 never in span. No collision on freeway 6 ever.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: same, (18,7,right,6), same as above, no collision.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (18,7,right,6) same as above, no collision.\n\nSecond car: (-30,-41,right,6) — head=-30, tail=-41, right-moving.\n\nmin=min(-30,-41)= -41, max=max(-30,-41)= -30, span at Δt [min + s Δt, max + s Δt] = [-41 +6Δt, -30 +6Δt]\n\n0 in span if -41 +6Δt <= 0 <= -30 +6Δt\n\nSolve:\n\nLeft: -41 +6Δt <=0 => 6Δt <=41 => Δt <= 41/6 ≈6.833\n\nRight: 0 <= -30 +6Δt => 30 <=6Δt => Δt >=5\n\nSo for Δt >=5 and Δt <=6.833, so Δt=5,6.\n\nΔt=5: min=-41+30= -11, max=-30+30=0, span [-11,0], 0 in it.\n\nΔt=6: min=-41+36= -5, max=-30+36=6, span [-5,6], 0 in it.\n\nΔt=7: min=-41+42=1, max=-30+42=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 8, this car causes collision at t=53 (Δt=5) and t=54 (Δt=6).\n\nNow, summarize for each freeway, at which turns collision occurs if player is on that y:\n\ny=1: collision only at t=48 (Δt=0)\n\ny=2: same as y=1, collision only at t=48\n\ny=3: collision at t=50 (Δt=2)\n\nSimilarly y=4: at t=50\n\ny=5: at t=50\n\ny=6: no collision\n\ny=7: no collision\n\ny=8: collision at t=53 and t=54\n\ny=0 and y=9: no cars, always safe.\n\nPlayer starts at t=48, y=4.\n\nAt t=48, on y=4, is there collision? y=4 is freeway 4? Freeways y=1 to 8.\n\ny=4: at t=48, Δt=0, for y=4, we have cars, but at t=48, for y=4, is 0 occupied?\n\nFor y=4, cars: (-24,-35,right,12), etc., at Δt=0.\n\nFirst car: span [-35,-24], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [49,60], no.\n\nThird: [13,24], no.\n\nSo at t=48, on y=4, no collision, since no car has 0 in span at t=48 for y=4.\n\nSimilarly, for other y.\n\nBut for y=1 and y=2, at t=48, collision if on it, but player not on it.\n\nNow, we need to go from y=4 to y=9 in min turns.\n\nPossible actions: U, D, S.\n\nSince we need to increase y, D is not helpful unless to avoid, but let's see the collision points.\n\nThe dangerous turns are when on certain y at certain t.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- At t=50, y=3,4,5 have collision.\n\n- At t=53, y=8 has collision.\n\n- At t=54, y=8 has collision.\n\nOther times and y are safe, except y=1 and y=2 at t=48, but that's past.\n\ny=6 and y=7 always safe.\n\ny=0 and y=9 safe.\n\nPlayer at t=48, y=4, safe.\n\nWe need to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nMin H such that after H-1 actions, from t=48 to t=48+H-1, y reaches 9.\n\nSet t_start = 48.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn t = t_start + k, position y_{t_start + k}\n\nStart at k=0, t=48, y=4.\n\nAfter first action at t=48, we move to y_{49} based on a_{48}\n\nThe sequence: actions from t=48 to t=48 + H-1, so after H actions? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence is {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a_{48} to a_{48 + H-1}\n\nThen after action a_{48}, at turn 49, y is updated.\n\nAfter last action a_{48+H-1}, at turn (48+H-1)+1 = 48+H, y is set.\n\nWe need y_{48+H} = 9? No.\n\nAt turn T, after actions, the position is for that turn.\n\nStart: at turn 48, position (0,4)\n\nAfter action a_{48}, at turn 49, position y_{49} = y_{48} + Δy based on a_{48}\n\nSimilarly, after a_{49}, at turn 50, y_{50}, and so on.\n\nAfter action a_{t}, at turn t+1, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nThe position at turn t is before action a_t? I think.\n\nDefine:\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, player is at position y_t.\n\nThen, action a_t is taken, which determines Δy_t, and then y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nCollision at turn t: if at turn t, player is on freeway y_t, and for that y_t, there is a car with 0 in span at turn t.\n\nIn the dynamics: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 in Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T.\"\n\nAnd y_T is the position at turn T.\n\nWhen moving: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered on y_{T+1} at turn T, so only check y_T at turn T.\"\n\nSo at each turn T, we check collision based on y_T and the cars on y_T at that turn.\n\nNow, from y=4 at t=48, we need to reach y=9 at some turn T.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, we can stop there.\n\nMinimal turns: from 4 to 9, min 5 steps up, so at t=53, y=9 if we go up each turn.\n\nt=48: y=4\n\nAfter a_48: if U, y_49=5\n\na_49: U, y_50=6\n\na_50: U, y_51=7\n\na_51: U, y_52=8\n\na_52: U, y_53=9\n\nThen at t=53, y=9, which is safe.\n\nBut we need to check for each turn if collision occurs.\n\nAt each turn T from 48 to 52, we have y_T and check collision.\n\nt=48: y=4, on freeway 4, at t=48, as before, no collision, safe.\n\nt=49: y=49? After a_48, y_49=5 (if U)\n\ny_49=5, at turn 49.\n\nFreeway 5, at t=49.\n\nFor freeway 5, cars same as 3 and 4.\n\nAt t=49, Δt=1 from t_1=48.\n\nFor freeway 5, at Δt=1, t=49.\n\nFirst car: (-24,-35,right,12), span at Δt=1: [-35+12(1), -24+12(1)] = [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: (60,49,right,12), [49+12,60+12]=[61,72], no\n\nThird: (24,13,right,12), [13+12,24+12]=[25,36], no\n\nSo no collision at t=49 on y=5.\n\nt=50: y_50=6 (after U from y=5)\n\ny_50=6, at turn 50.\n\nFreeway 6, which has no collision ever, as we saw earlier. Safe.\n\nt=51: y_51=7, freeway 7, no collision, safe.\n\nt=52: y_52=8, freeway 8, at turn 52.\n\nt=52, Δt=4 from t_1=48.\n\nFreeway 8, cars: first (18,7,right,6), span at Δt=4: [7+6*4, 18+6*4] = [7+24,18+24]=[31,42], no 0.\n\nSecond car: (-30,-41,right,6), span at Δt=4: [-41+6*4, -30+6*4] = [-41+24, -30+24] = [-17,-6], 0 not in. So safe.\n\nt=53: y_53=9, which is not a freeway, safe.\n\nSo this path: all U, from t=48 to 52: actions U,U,U,U,U, reaching y=9 at t=53.\n\nH=5 turns? Let's see the number of actions.\n\nStart at t=48, y=4.\n\nAfter first action a_48=U, at t=49, y=5\n\na_49=U, t=50, y=6\n\na_50=U, t=51, y=7\n\na_51=U, t=52, y=8\n\na_52=U, t=53, y=9\n\nSo we used actions from t=48 to t=52, that's 5 actions: a48 to a52.\n\nThen at t=53, y=9.\n\nH is the number of turns from t_1 to t_1+H-1 for actions, so with H actions, we reach at turn t_1 + H.\n\nHere t_1=48, after H=5 actions, at turn 53, y=9.\n\nAnd in this path, no collision at any turn.\n\nBut earlier we have collision at t=50 for y=3,4,5, but in this path, at t=50, we are on y=6, which is safe.\n\nSimilarly, at t=53, on y=9, safe.\n\nAt t=53, y=8 has collision? But we are not on it.\n\nIn this case, it seems we can reach in 5 turns.\n\nBut let's confirm freeway 8 at t=53.\n\nFreeway 8 collision at t=53 and 54, but we are on y=9 at t=53, so no issue.\n\nIn the path above, at t=52, we are on y=8, but at t=52, Δt=4, freeway 8 safe, as above.\n\nSo it works.\n\nBut is there a reason to take more turns? Probably not, since min is 5.\n\nBut let's see if we can do in less? From y=4 to y=9, min 5 moves up, so no, 5 is minimum possible.\n\nWith S or D, it would take more turns.\n\nSo this should be fine.\n\nBut in the action sequence, for turn t_1=48, we need to output actions from a_{48} to a_{48+H-1}, with H min.\n\nIn this case, all U.\n\nBut let's write the sequence.\n\nTurn 48: a_{48} = U\n\nThen at t=49, y=5\n\nTurn 49: a_{49} = U, t=50, y=6\n\nTurn 50: a_{50} = U, t=51, y=7\n\nTurn 51: a_{51} = U, t=52, y=8\n\nTurn 52: a_{52} = U, t=53, y=9\n\nH=5 actions, from t=48 to 52.\n\nBut at turn 52, we are taking action to go to y=9 at t=53.\n\nNow, but we need to make sure that at each step, no collision when we are on the freeway.\n\nAt t=48: on y=4, freeway 4, at t=48, as above, no collision.\n\nt=49: on y=5, freeway 5, at t=49, Δt=1, for y=5, cars: span at Δt=1: first car [-35+12, -24+12]=[-23,-12], no 0; others no, so safe.\n\nt=50: on y=6, freeway 6, no cars ever, safe.\n\nt=51: on y=7, freeway 7, no cars, safe.\n\nt=52: on y=8, freeway 8, at t=52, Δt=4, as above, span first car [7+24,18+24]=[31,42], no; second car [-41+24, -30+24]=[-17,-6], no 0, safe.\n\nThen after a52=U, at t=53, y=9, safe.\n\nPerfect.\n\nBut the problem says \"reach (0,9)\", and we do at t=53.\n\nBut is there a way with H less? H=4? Then from y=4, after 4 actions, y=9? Only if we move up 5 steps, but with 4 actions, max y=4+4=8, or if we start from t=48, after 4 actions, at t=52, y could be 8 if all U, but we need y=9, so must have at least 5 actions to reach y=9. So min H=5.\n\nWith S or D, it takes more, so 5 is min.\n\nBut in this case, it works with all U.\n\nBut earlier I thought y=3,4,5 have collision at t=50, but we are on y=6 at t=50, so fine.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at t=53,54 collision, but we are on y=9 at t=53, and at t=52 on y=8 but safe.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 8 at t=53.\n\nAt t=53, if we were on y=8, collision, but we are not.\n\nIn the sequence above, we never hit a collision point.\n\nPerhaps we can go slower, but no need.\n\nAnother thing: at turn t=48, if we do S, then stay at y=4, but then at t=49, y=4 still, then we need to go up later, takes more turns.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down to y=3, but y=3 at t=50 has collision, so dangerous.\n\nFor example, if at t=48, we do D, to y=3 at t=49, then at t=49, y=3, Δt=1, for freeway 3, at t=49, Δt=1, as before, no collision? At t=49, freeway 3, Δt=1: first car span [-23,-12], no 0; others no, so safe. But then at t=50, if we go to y=4, but at t=50, y=4 has collision? At t=50, Δt=2, freeway 4, first car span [-35+24, -24+24]=[-11,0], 0 in it, so if on y=4 at t=50, collision.\n\nSo if we go down to y=3 at t=49, then we need to avoid y=4 at t=50.\n\nBut in our direct path, we don't need to.\n\nSo the all U path is fine.\n\nBut in the output, we need to list the actions.\n\nSo actions: a48=U, a49=U, a50=U, a51=U, a52=U.\n\nH=5.\n\nBut let's write in the format.\n\nTurn 48: a_{48} = U\n\nTurn 49: a_{49} = U\n\nTurn 50: a_{50} = U\n\nTurn 51: a_{51} = U\n\nTurn 52: a_{52} = U\n\nAnd after that, at turn 53, y=9.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, for turn t_1 + t from t=0 to H-1, here t_1=48, t from 0 to 4, since H-1=4, H=5.\n\nt=0: a48, t=1: a49, ..., t=4: a52.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, but I think we are done.\n\nBut just to be thorough, what if we start with S at t=48.\n\nThen at t=49, y=4 still.\n\nThen at t=49, we can go U to y=5 at t=50.\n\nBut at t=50, y=5, which has collision? At t=50, Δt=2, freeway 5, first car span [-11,0], 0 in it, so if on y=5 at t=50, collision.\n\nSimilarly, if at t=48 S, stay y=4 at t=49, then at t=49, if U, to y=5 at t=50, but at t=50, y=5, collision.\n\nIf at t=49, we do S again, stay y=4 at t=50, then at t=50, y=4, collision since span has 0.\n\nSo we must not be on y=4 or y=5 at t=50.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 at t=50 collision.\n\nSo at t=50, we must be on y=6,7,8,0,9.\n\nIn our path, we are on y=6 at t=50.\n\nIf we go directly, we reach y=6 at t=50, which is fine.\n\nIf we go down to y=3 at t=49, then at t=50, y=3 collision.\n\nNot good.\n\nOr if we go to y=2, but at t=48, if D, to y=3 at t=49, then at t=50, y=3 collision.\n\nThen we need to move away.\n\nBut it would take more turns.\n\nFor example, at t=48, D to y=3 at t=49.\n\nt=49: y=3, freeway 3, at t=49, Δt=1, span for cars: first [-23,-12], no 0, so safe? But then at t=50, if we do U to y=4, but at t=50, y=4 collision.\n\nIf at t=49, we do U to y=4 at t=50, collision.\n\nIf at t=49, do S, stay y=3 at t=50, collision.\n\nSo we must leave y=3 before t=50.\n\nBut at t=49, we are on y=3, and we can only change at the action.\n\nAfter a_{49}, at t=50, y_{50} is set.\n\nAt t=49, position y=3, then we take action a_{49}.\n\nIf a_{49}=U, then y_{50}=4\n\nBut at t=50, on y=4, collision.\n\nIf a_{49}=D, then y_{50}=2, at t=50.\n\ny=2, freeway 2, at t=50, Δt=2.\n\nFreeway 2: car (-24,11,left,36), at Δt=2, span [-24-72,11-72]=[-96,-61], no 0, so safe? But then we are at y=2, need to go up to 9, which takes more turns.\n\nSimilarly, if a_{49}=S, y_{50}=3, collision.\n\nSo only option is to go down to y=2 at t=50, then from there go up, but it will take longer.\n\nFor example, from y=2 at t=50, then go U to y=3 at t=51, etc., but at t=51, y=3 is safe since no collision except at t=50, etc.\n\nBut min is 5, so no need.\n\nSimilarly, other paths.\n\nSo the direct up path is shortest and safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 5, with all U actions.\n\nNow, for the answer.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nTurn 48: U\n\nTurn 49: U\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let's write as per format.\n\n\\boxed{ Turn 48: a_{48} = U \\\\ Turn 49: a_{49} = U \\\\ Turn 50: a_{50} = U \\\\ Turn 51: a_{51} = U \\\\ Turn 52: a_{52} = U }\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so with curly braces, but in text, we can write.\n\nIn the answer, it should be like:\n\nTurn 48: a_{48} = U\n\nTurn 49: a_{49} = U\n\nTurn 50: a_{50} = U\n\nTurn 51: a_{51} = U\n\nTurn 52: a_{52} = U\n\nAnd H=5.\n\nBut since it says \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence\", but in the box, only the sequence is given, I think.\n\nThe answer format shows the sequence with actions.\n\nSo I think that's it.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 4) at turn 48 and needs to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y = 1 to y = 8.\n\nThe car states and collision analysis show that:\n- Freeways y = 1 and y = 2 have a collision only at turn 48 (Δt = 0), but the player is not on these freeways at that turn.\n- Freeways y = 3, y = 4, and y = 5 have a collision at turn 50 (Δt = 2) due to a car spanning [-11, 0] on each freeway.\n- Freeway y = 8 has collisions at turns 53 (Δt = 5) and 54 (Δt = 6) due to a car spanning [-11, 0] and [-5, 6], respectively.\n- Freeways y = 6 and y = 7 have no collisions at any turn.\n- Positions y = 0 and y = 9 are always safe, as they have no cars.\n\nThe minimal path to reach y = 9 from y = 4 requires at least 5 upward moves (U actions), as the y-coordinate must increase by 5. A sequence of five U actions achieves this:\n\n- At turn 48, action U moves to y = 5 at turn 49. At turn 48, y = 4 is safe (no collision on freeway 4 at turn 48).\n- At turn 49, action U moves to y = 6 at turn 50. At turn 49, y = 5 is safe (no collision on freeway 5 at turn 49).\n- At turn 50, action U moves to y = 7 at turn 51. At turn 50, y = 6 is safe (freeway 6 has no collisions).\n- At turn 51, action U moves to y = 8 at turn 52. At turn 51, y = 7 is safe (freeway 7 has no collisions).\n- At turn 52, action U moves to y = 9 at turn 53. At turn 52, y = 8 is safe (no collision on freeway 8 at turn 52).\n\nThis sequence reaches y = 9 at turn 53 with no collisions. Since 5 is the minimum number of turns required to increase y from 4 to 9, and the path is collision-free, H = 5 is minimal.\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n\n\\boxed{ \\text{Turn } 48: a_{48} = U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 49: a_{49} = U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 50: a_{50} = U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 51: a_{51} = U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 52: a_{52} = U }",

        "thinking": "<think>I need to get from (0,5) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding collisions with cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t1 = 49, but since we're starting from turn t1, I'll just think of it as turn 0 for simplicity in my calculations. So, initial position is y=5.\n\nThe player moves up, down, or stays with U, D, S actions. y must stay between 0 and 9 inclusive.\n\nCars move on their freeways, and collision happens only if at turn T, the player is on a freeway y_T and for that freeway, 0 is in the span of some car at that turn. Also, when you move to a new row, you're not on that row until the next turn, so you don't collide with cars on the row you're moving to at the current turn.\n\nThe car spans are given for turn t1=49, and for future turns, we compute the span based on the direction and speed.\n\nFirst, I need to find the minimal H and the sequence of actions.\n\nSince we're moving from y=5 to y=9, we need to go up 4 units. But we can also move down or stay, but to minimize turns, we probably want to go up as much as possible, but we have to avoid the cars.\n\nThe freeways are y=1 to 8, and we start at y=5, which is a freeway, so we might be at risk immediately if there's a car at position 0 on y=5 at turn t1.\n\nLet me list all the cars for each freeway at turn t1=49.\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head -60, tail -25, direction left, speed 36. Since it's left-moving, span is [h, τ] = [-60, -25]. At turn T, span is [h - s(T-t1), τ - s(T-t1)] = [-60 - 36*(T-49), -25 - 36*(T-49)]\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2: same as freeway 1: [-60, -25] left, speed 36.\n\nFreeway 3: three cars:\n\nFirst: head -12, tail -23, direction right. For right-moving, span is [τ, h] because tail is smaller? Let's see the notation.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t1) = [h, τ] and it becomes [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nFor right-moving: Span(t1) = [τ, h] and becomes [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nIn freeway 3, it says: (-12, -23, right, 12)\n\nSo, head is -12, tail is -23? But for right-moving, it should be that head is greater than tail, I think.\n\nIn the notation: for right-moving, it says \"Span(t1) = [τ, h]\" and in the example, it's given as (head, tail, dir, speed), but for right-moving, head should be the front, so if moving right, head > tail.\n\nHere, head = -12, tail = -23, since -12 > -23, so head is at -12, tail at -23, so span is from tail to head: [τ, h] = [-23, -12]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (-48, -59, right, 12), head -48, tail -59, so span [τ, h] = [-59, -48]\n\nThird car: (36, 25, right, 12), head 36, tail 25, so [τ, h] = [25, 36]\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3, I think: (-12,-23,right,12), (-48,-59,right,12), (36,25,right,12)\n\nFreeway 5: same as 3 and 4.\n\nFreeway 6: one car: (24,13,right,6), so head 24, tail 13, direction right, speed 6, so span [τ,h] = [13,24]\n\nFreeway 7: same as 6: (24,13,right,6), span [13,24]\n\nFreeway 8: two cars: (24,13,right,6) and (-24,-35,right,6)\n\nFirst car: (24,13,right,6), span [13,24]\n\nSecond car: (-24,-35,right,6), head -24, tail -35, so [τ,h] = [-35,-24]\n\nNow, for each freeway, at any turn T, we need to know when 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway.\n\nCollision occurs if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, 0 is in some car's span at turn T.\n\nSince the player starts at y=5 at turn t1, we need to check if at turn t1, on freeway 5, is 0 in any car's span.\n\nFreeway 5 has cars: first: [τ,h] = [-23,-12] at T=t1, so -23 to -12, 0 is not in this, since -23 to -12 is all negative.\n\nSecond car: [-59,-48], all negative, 0 not in.\n\nThird car: [25,36], all positive, 0 not in. So at turn t1, on freeway 5, no car has 0 in span, so safe to be there.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, but we're only on y=5 at t1.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9. y=9 is the top, which is not a freeway, freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=0 and y=9 are safe, no cars.\n\ny=0 and y=9 are not freeways, so no cars there, so safe.\n\nWe start at y=5, need to reach y=9.\n\nMinimal moves: if we go up every turn, y=6,7,8,9, but y=6,7,8 are freeways, so we need to avoid when cars are at 0.\n\nSince we can only change y by +1, -1, or 0 per turn, the minimal H would be at least 4, since from 5 to 9, difference 4, so H=4 if we go up each turn.\n\nBut we need to check if that's possible without collision.\n\nSo, let's consider the sequence: U, U, U, U to go to y=6 at turn t1+1, y=7 at t1+2, y=8 at t1+3, y=9 at t1+4.\n\nBut at each turn, when we are on a freeway, we need to ensure that at that turn, no car has 0 in its span for that row.\n\nAlso, when we move, we are not on the new row until the next turn.\n\nLet's define the turns.\n\nSet t1 = 49 as turn 0 for simplicity. So current turn: t=0, position y=5.\n\nAfter action a_0, at t=1, y = y_0 + Δy_0, and so on.\n\nThe position y_t is after action a_{t-1}, I think? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t1, position is (0, y_{t1}), which is given as (0,5).\n\nThen after action a_{t1}, at turn t1+1, position is (0, y_{t1+1}) = (0, y_{t1} + Δy_{t1})\n\nSimilarly, after action a_{t1+t}, at turn t1+t+1, position is (0, y_{t1} + sum of Δy up to t)\n\nBut for collision, at turn T, if player is on freeway y_T, then check cars on that freeway at turn T.\n\ny_T is the position at turn T, which is determined after actions up to T-1.\n\nIn terms of time: at the start of turn T, the player is at position y_T, and that's when we check for collision if y_T is between 1 and 8.\n\nThen we choose action a_T, which determines Δy_T, and then at turn T+1, position is y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nAnd when we move, during the move, we don't occupy the new position until the next turn.\n\nSo for collision, only at the start of each turn, when position is fixed.\n\nFor example, at turn T, position y_T, if 1≤y_T≤8, then check if 0 in car span on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nThen after action, move to y_{T+1}, and so on.\n\nWe start at t=0 (which is t1=49), y=5, which is freeway, but as we saw, no car at 0, so safe.\n\nWe want to be at y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince y=9 is safe, we can be there at turn H, meaning after H-1 actions or something? Let's see.\n\nThe sequence of actions from t=0 to H-1, so after H actions? No.\n\nThe actions are {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so t from 0 to H-1, that's H actions.\n\nAfter these H actions, we have H position changes, but the position at turn t1 is given, so after 0 actions, at turn t1, position y.\n\nAfter first action a_{t1} at turn t1, we go to turn t1+1 with new position.\n\nSo after k actions, we are at turn t1+k.\n\nThe minimal H such that at turn t1 + H, position is 9? Let's see the task.\n\n\"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\"\n\nLet's read carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\"\n\nReach at turn t1 + H - 1.\n\nAnd actions from t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo, at turn t1 (turn 0), position y_0 =5\n\nAfter action a_0, at turn t1+1 (turn 1), position y_1\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{H-2}, at turn t1 + H - 1, position y_{H-1}\n\nAnd we want y_{H-1} =9 at turn t1 + H - 1.\n\nWith H actions from t=0 to H-1, we go from turn t1 to turn t1 + H.\n\nPosition at turn t1 + t for t=0 to H.\n\nAt turn t1 + t for t=0, position y_0\n\nAfter action a_{t1 + t}, position at turn t1 + t +1.\n\nSo to have position at turn T, it is after actions up to T-1 from start.\n\nWe start at turn T_start = t1, position given.\n\nWe want at some turn T_end, position =9.\n\nT_end = t1 + H - 1 for some H.\n\nAfter actions from t=0 to H-2, we are at turn t1 + (H-1)? Let's index turns.\n\nSet turn index: let τ be the turn number from t1.\n\nAt turn τ = t1, position y_{τ} =5\n\nAt turn τ = t1+1, position y_{τ} after action a_{τ-1}? Better to use τ relative to t1.\n\nDefine τ = 0,1,2,... where τ=0 is turn t1.\n\nPosition at turn τ: y_τ\n\nAt turn τ, we choose action a_τ, which determines y_{τ+1} = y_τ + Δy_τ\n\nFor collision, at turn τ, if y_τ is between 1 and 8, then we need that for freeway k=y_τ, at turn τ, no car has 0 in its span.\n\nWe want for some H, at turn τ = H, y_H =9.\n\nAnd actions from a_0 to a_{H-1}, since a_{H-1} determines y_H.\n\ny_H is at turn τ=H.\n\nτ from 0 to H.\n\nNumber of turns from start to end is H+1? Let's see the H definition.\n\nThe minimal number of turns H, and reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nIn the task: \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\"\n\nAnd actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nSo at turn t1 + t for t=0, action a_{t1+0} is chosen, and position at turn t1 + t is before action? I think I'm confusing.\n\nStandard way: at the beginning of turn t, position is fixed, we choose action, then position changes for the next turn.\n\nFor turn t1: at start, position (0,5), we choose action a_{t1}, then at turn t1+1, position is new based on a_{t1}.\n\nAt turn t1+1, position is y_{t1+1}, then we choose a_{t1+1}, and so on.\n\nCollision is checked at the start of each turn, before action.\n\nFor turn T, at start, position y_T, if 1≤y_T≤8, check cars on row y_T at turn T.\n\nThen we choose action a_T, then move to y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nWe want at some turn T, y_T =9.\n\nT = t1 + H -1 for some H.\n\nSince t1 is fixed, let's work with turn numbers from t1.\n\nLet T be turn number from t1, so T=0,1,2,... where T=0 is turn t1=49.\n\nPosition at turn T: y_T\n\nFor T=0, y_0 =5\n\nWe choose action a_T at turn T, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T\n\nCollision at turn T if 1≤y_T≤8 and for freeway k=y_T, at turn T, 0 is in some car's span.\n\nWe want y_K =9 for some K, with minimal K, and H is the number of actions, which is K, since from T=0 to T=K, we have K actions: a_0 to a_{K-1}, and position at T=K is after K actions.\n\nAt T=0, position y_0, no action yet.\n\nAfter action a_0, position at T=1 is y_1.\n\nAfter action a_{K-1}, position at T=K is y_K.\n\nWe want y_K =9.\n\nThe number of actions is K, from a_0 to a_{K-1}.\n\nIn the task, H is the number of turns for the sequence, but it says \"minimal number of turns H\", and \"reach at turn t1 + H -1\", so let's match.\n\nIn task: \"minimal number of turns H\" and \"reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H -1\"\n\nWith actions {a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nFor t=0, a_{t1+0} at turn t1\n\nFor t=1, a_{t1+1} at turn t1+1\n\n...\n\nFor t=H-1, a_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1\n\nThen at turn t1+H, position is after a_{t1+H-1}, but we want position at turn t1+H-1 to be (0,9).\n\nAt turn t1+H-1, position is y_{t1+H-1}, which is determined before action a_{t1+H-1} is applied.\n\nAt turn t1+H-1, we choose a_{t1+H-1}, which affects y at turn t1+H.\n\nTo have y at turn t1+H-1 equal to 9, it means at the start of turn t1+H-1, position is 9, so we don't need to act, but we do choose an action, but the position is already 9 at that turn.\n\nLet's clarify.\n\nAt the start of turn T, position y_T is fixed.\n\nWe then choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T.\n\nFor turn T, collision is checked based on y_T.\n\nWe want at the start of turn T_end, y_{T_end} =9 for some T_end.\n\nThen T_end = t1 + H -1 for some H.\n\nThe actions are from a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, which are chosen at turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nFor example, at turn t1, we choose a_{t1}, then at turn t1+1, position y_{t1+1}, and so on, up to at turn t1+H-1, we choose a_{t1+H-1}, and at that turn, position is y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nThen after action, at turn t1+H, position might be different, but we don't care, as long as at turn t1+H-1, it is 9.\n\nThe number of actions is H, from a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}.\n\nThe \"turns\" H refers to the number of actions, I think.\n\nMinimal H means minimal number of actions to reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nSince we start at y=5, to reach y=9, minimal actions is 4 if we go up each time, but we may need to wait or detour.\n\nH is the number of actions, so minimal H is at least 4.\n\nBut with waiting, H could be larger.\n\nFirst, let's see if H=4 is possible.\n\nSo, we want at turn T= t1 + H -1 = t1 +3, y=9.\n\nH=4, so T_end = t1 +3.\n\nAt turn T_end = t1+3, y=9.\n\nWith actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1+3}.\n\nBut a_{t1+3} is chosen at turn t1+3, but position at turn t1+3 is before that action, so to have y at turn t1+3 be 9, it is determined by previous actions.\n\nSet T relative to t1.\n\nLet T be turn offset, T=0 at t1.\n\nPosition at turn T: y_T\n\nFor T=0, y_0 =5\n\nAction a_T at turn T determines y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T\n\nWe want y_K =9 for some K.\n\nThen with K turns from T=0 to T=K, we have actions a_0 to a_{K-1}, and y_K at turn K.\n\nThe number of actions is K.\n\nIn task, H is such that actions from t=0 to H-1, and reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nFor T relative, at turn T, we want y_T =9 for T = H-1? Let's set.\n\nLet S = T - t1, so S=0,1,2,... for turns.\n\nAt turn S, position y_S.\n\nCollision at turn S if 1≤y_S≤8 and 0 in some car span on row y_S at turn S.\n\nAction a_S at turn S determines y_{S+1} = y_S + Δy_S.\n\nWe want y_M =9 for some M.\n\nThen M is the turn offset when we reach y=9.\n\nThe actions are from a_0 to a_{M-1}, because a_{M-1} determines y_M from y_{M-1}, but y_M is at turn M.\n\nAt turn M, y_M is fixed, and we choose a_M which affects y_{M+1}, but for reaching y_M=9, we don't care about a_M.\n\nThe sequence of actions to reach y_M=9 is a_0 to a_{M-1}, number of actions is M.\n\nThen in task, H is the number of actions, so H = M.\n\nAnd we reach at turn t1 + M, which is t1 + H.\n\nBut task says \"reach at turn t1 + H -1\", so inconsistency.\n\nI think I have a mistake.\n\nLet's read the task carefully.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9) at turn t1 + H - 1\"\n\nSo, reach at turn T_reach = t1 + H - 1\n\nWith actions a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1}, which are chosen at turns t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nAt turn T_reach = t1 + H - 1, position is y_{T_reach} =9.\n\nAt turn T_reach, we choose action a_{T_reach}, but the position is already 9 before the action.\n\nSo for the position to be 9 at turn T_reach, it is determined by actions up to a_{T_reach -1}.\n\nThe last action that affects y at T_reach is a_{T_reach -1}, which is applied at turn T_reach -1 to go to T_reach.\n\nLet's think.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T is fixed.\n\ny_T depends on the action at turn T-1.\n\nSpecifically, y_T = y_{T-1} + Δy_{T-1} from a_{T-1}.\n\nFor T_reach = t1 + H - 1, y_{T_reach} =9.\n\ny_{T_reach} is determined by a_{T_reach -1}, which is chosen at turn T_reach -1.\n\nThe actions include a_{T_reach}, but it doesn't affect y at T_reach, it affects y at T_reach+1.\n\nIn the sequence, for t from 0 to H-1, a_{t1+t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nFor t=0, a_{t1} at turn t1\n\nt=1, a_{t1+1} at turn t1+1\n\n...\n\nt=H-1, a_{t1+H-1} at turn t1+H-1\n\nNow, at turn t1+H-1, position y_{t1+H-1} is determined before a_{t1+H-1} is chosen.\n\nWe want y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\nSo the action a_{t1+H-1} is chosen at that turn, but it doesn't affect the position at that turn; it affects the next turn.\n\nSo for reaching the position, we need actions up to a_{t1+H-2} to determine y at t1+H-1.\n\nBut the sequence includes a_{t1+H-1}, which is not necessary for the position at t1+H-1, but we have to specify it, I think, but it can be anything since we don't care about later positions.\n\nBut for minimal H, we want to reach as soon as possible.\n\nSo to have y_M =9 for some M, with minimal M.\n\nThen H = M, and T_reach = t1 + M, but task says T_reach = t1 + H -1, so for H=M, T_reach = t1 + M -1? Let's solve.\n\nSet M such that at turn t1 + M, y=9.\n\nThen the number of actions to achieve this is M, since from a_{t1} to a_{t1+M-1}.\n\nThen H should be M, the number of actions.\n\nThen T_reach = t1 + M = t1 + H.\n\nBut task says reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nSo for H=M, it should be t1 + H, but it says t1 + H -1, so perhaps H is defined as the number of turns from start to reach, including the start or not.\n\nI think there's a confusion in the indexing.\n\nTo simplify, I'll find the minimal number of actions to reach y=9, and the turn when it happens.\n\nLet's assume we start at turn 0 (t1), y=5.\n\nAfter k actions, at turn k, position y_k.\n\nWe want y_k =9 for some k, with minimal k.\n\nThen H = k, and actions a_0 to a_{k-1}.\n\nThen in the task, reach at turn t1 + k, which is t1 + H.\n\nBut task says t1 + H -1, so perhaps k is the turn offset, so at turn t1 + k, y=9.\n\nThen for the task, T_reach = t1 + k = t1 + H, so H = k, and T_reach = t1 + H, but task says t1 + H -1, so it doesn't match.\n\nPerhaps the reach turn is before the last action.\n\nI think I should just go with the task description.\n\nSuppose H is the number of actions.\n\nThen actions a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-1} for turns from t1 to t1+H-1.\n\nThen at turn t1 + H -1, position y_{t1+H-1} =9.\n\ny_{t1+H-1} is determined by actions up to a_{t1+H-2}.\n\na_{t1+H-1} is chosen at turn t1+H-1, but it affects y at t1+H, not at t1+H-1.\n\nSo for y at t1+H-1 to be 9, it depends on a_{t1} to a_{t1+H-2}, and a_{t1+H-1} is irrelevant for that position.\n\nBut the sequence includes a_{t1+H-1}, so we have to specify it, but it can be S or something.\n\nFor minimal H, we want to reach at some turn with as few actions as possible.\n\nSince we start at y=5, to reach y=9, we need at least 4 U actions, but we can have S or D in between, so H can be larger than 4.\n\nBut the position can be reached at different turns with different H.\n\nFor example, if we go U,U,U,U, H=4 actions, we reach at turn t1+4.\n\nIf we go S first, then U,U,U,U, H=5 actions, reach at turn t1+5, etc.\n\nBut the turn when we reach is later.\n\nMinimal H means minimal number of actions, which corresponds to reaching as soon as possible, so minimal H also means minimal turn to reach.\n\nSo we want to reach y=9 at the earliest possible turn, with minimal actions.\n\nSo in practice, we can find the minimal turn when y=9 can be achieved, and the actions to get there.\n\nI think for this problem, since the cars are moving, we need to find when it's safe to be on each row.\n\nBack to the cars.\n\nFirst, for each freeway, at each turn, we need to know if it is safe to be on that row at that turn, i.e., no car has 0 in span.\n\nThen we can plan a path from y=5 at turn 0 to y=9 at some turn K, with actions.\n\nSince y changes slowly, we can think of the grid over time.\n\nBut time is discrete turns.\n\nLet me first compute for each freeway, for each turn, whether 0 is occupied by a car.\n\nTurn relative to t1=49, so let ΔT = T - 49 for turn number.\n\nFor a given freeway k, at turn ΔT, the span of each car.\n\nCollision if for some car on k, 0 in [low, high] of the span at turn ΔT.\n\nFor freeway 1: cars: one car, left-moving, head h=-60, tail τ=-25, speed s=36.\n\nAt turn ΔT, span: [ h - s ΔT, τ - s ΔT ] = [ -60 - 36ΔT, -25 - 36ΔT ]\n\n0 in this if -60 -36ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -25 -36ΔT\n\nBut since -60-36ΔT < -25-36ΔT <0 for all ΔT, because both negative, so 0 is never in the interval. So freeway 1 is always safe, no car at 0.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2: same as freeway 1, always safe.\n\nNow freeway 3: three cars, all right-moving.\n\nFirst car: head -12, tail -23, so span at ΔT=0: [τ, h] = [-23,-12], and for right-moving, at turn ΔT, span [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT] = [-23 + 12ΔT, -12 + 12ΔT]\n\n0 in this if -23 +12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -12 +12ΔT\n\nWhich is 23/12 ≤ ΔT ≤ 12/12? Let's see:\n\n-23 +12ΔT ≤ 0 => 12ΔT ≤ 23 => ΔT ≤ 23/12 ≈ 1.916, so ΔT <=1 since integer\n\nAnd 0 <= -12 +12ΔT => 12 <= 12ΔT => ΔT >=1\n\nSo 1 <= ΔT <=1, so only at ΔT=1, 0 in [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], so 0 is included, since high is 0.\n\n[ -11, 0 ], 0 is the upper bound, is 0 included? The span is [low, high], inclusive, I assume.\n\nIn the collision, if 0 in span, and span includes endpoints, I think.\n\nIn the definition, \"0 in Span(T)\", so if span is closed interval, yes.\n\nAt ΔT=1, span [-23+12*1, -12+12*1] = [-11, 0], so 0 is in it.\n\nAt other ΔT, not.\n\nFor example, ΔT=0, [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nΔT=1, [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nΔT=2, [-23+24, -12+24] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for first car on freeway 3, unsafe at ΔT=1.\n\nSecond car: head -48, tail -59, speed 12, right-moving.\n\nSpan at ΔT: [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT] = [-59 + 12ΔT, -48 + 12ΔT]\n\n0 in this if -59 +12ΔT <= 0 <= -48 +12ΔT\n\nSo -59 +12ΔT <=0 => 12ΔT <=59 => ΔT <= 59/12 ≈4.916, so ΔT <=4\n\nAnd 0 <= -48 +12ΔT => 48 <=12ΔT => ΔT >=4\n\nSo ΔT=4, span [-59+48, -48+48] = [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nOtherwise not.\n\nThird car: head 36, tail 25, speed 12, right-moving.\n\nSpan at ΔT: [25 + 12ΔT, 36 + 12ΔT]\n\nBoth positive for all ΔT, so 0 never in, safe.\n\nSo for freeway 3, unsafe at ΔT=1 (from first car) and at ΔT=4 (from second car).\n\nAt other times, safe.\n\nNow freeway 4: same as freeway 3, since same cars, so unsafe at ΔT=1 and ΔT=4.\n\nSimilarly freeway 5: same, unsafe at ΔT=1 and ΔT=4.\n\nNow freeway 6: one car, (24,13,right,6), head 24, tail 13, so span [13,24] at ΔT=0.\n\nRight-moving, so at ΔT, [τ + s ΔT, h + s ΔT] = [13 + 6ΔT, 24 + 6ΔT]\n\nAll positive, so 0 never in, safe for all ΔT.\n\nSimilarly freeway 7: same as 6, always safe.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars.\n\nFirst car: (24,13,right,6), same as above, [13+6ΔT,24+6ΔT], always positive, safe.\n\nSecond car: (-24,-35,right,6), head -24, tail -35, so span [τ, h] = [-35,-24] at ΔT=0.\n\nRight-moving, at ΔT, [ -35 + 6ΔT, -24 + 6ΔT ]\n\n0 in this if -35 +6ΔT <= 0 <= -24 +6ΔT\n\nSo -35 +6ΔT <=0 => 6ΔT <=35 => ΔT <= 35/6 ≈5.833, so ΔT <=5\n\nAnd 0 <= -24 +6ΔT => 24 <=6ΔT => ΔT >=4\n\nSo for ΔT=4,5\n\nAt ΔT=4, [-35+24, -24+24] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nAt ΔT=5, [-35+30, -24+30] = [-5,6], 0 in since -5<=0<=6\n\nAt ΔT=6, [-35+36, -24+36] = [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo for freeway 8, unsafe at ΔT=4 and ΔT=5 from the second car.\n\nFirst car always safe.\n\nSummary of unsafe times for each freeway:\n\nFreeway 1: always safe\n\nFreeway 2: always safe\n\nFreeway 3: unsafe at ΔT=1,4\n\nFreeway 4: unsafe at ΔT=1,4\n\nFreeway 5: unsafe at ΔT=1,4\n\nFreeway 6: always safe\n\nFreeway 7: always safe\n\nFreeway 8: unsafe at ΔT=4,5\n\nWe start at turn ΔT=0, y=5.\n\ny=5 is freeway 5, and at ΔT=0, it is safe, as we saw earlier.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\ny=9 is not a freeway, so always safe.\n\nThe freeways in between: y=6,7,8.\n\ny=6 is freeway 6, always safe.\n\ny=7 is freeway 7, always safe.\n\ny=8 is freeway 8, unsafe at ΔT=4,5.\n\nWe need to be on these rows at certain turns without collision.\n\nSince we start at y=5 at ΔT=0, and we can move up, down, or stay.\n\nTo minimize actions, we want to go up directly if possible.\n\nBut we have to avoid being on unsafe rows at unsafe times.\n\nFor example, if we go up immediately:\n\nAt ΔT=0, y=5, safe.\n\nAction a_0 = U, then at ΔT=1, y=6.\n\ny=6 is freeway 6, always safe, so at ΔT=1, safe.\n\nAction a_1 = U, then at ΔT=2, y=7.\n\ny=7, freeway 7, always safe, so safe.\n\nAction a_2 = U, then at ΔT=3, y=8.\n\ny=8, freeway 8, at ΔT=3: is it unsafe? From above, freeway 8 unsafe at ΔT=4 and 5, not at 3, so at ΔT=3, safe.\n\nThen action a_3 = U, then at ΔT=4, y=9, which is safe.\n\nBut we want to be at y=9 at some turn. At ΔT=4, y=9, which is turn t1+4.\n\nBut with actions: at ΔT=0, a_0=U to go to y=6 at ΔT=1\n\nΔT=1, a_1=U to go to y=7 at ΔT=2\n\nΔT=2, a_2=U to go to y=8 at ΔT=3\n\nΔT=3, a_3=U to go to y=9 at ΔT=4\n\nWe are at y=9 at ΔT=4.\n\nBut we need to be at y=9 at the turn, and for that turn, it should be safe, which it is.\n\nIn terms of the task, we want to reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nHere, at ΔT=4, which is turn t1+4.\n\nSet H such that t1 + H -1 = t1+4, so H-1=4, H=5.\n\nActions from a_{t1} to a_{t1+4}, that's 5 actions.\n\nBut with 4 actions: a_0 to a_3, we reach y=9 at ΔT=4.\n\nSequence: a_0=U, a_1=U, a_2=U, a_3=U\n\nAt turn ΔT=0: y=5, safe\n\nAfter a_0=U, at ΔT=1: y=6, safe\n\nAfter a_1=U, at ΔT=2: y=7, safe\n\nAfter a_2=U, at ΔT=3: y=8, which is freeway 8, at ΔT=3: unsafe? Freeway 8 unsafe at ΔT=4 and 5, not at 3.\n\nAt ΔT=3, freeway 8: second car span [-35 +6*3, -24 +6*3] = [-35+18, -24+18] = [-17,-6], all negative, 0 not in. Safe.\n\nThen after a_3=U, at ΔT=4: y=9, safe.\n\nBut at ΔT=4, we are at y=9, but we need to check if at any point we were on unsafe row.\n\nAt ΔT=3, we were on y=8, which was safe.\n\nNow, but we want to reach at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nHere, we reached y=9 at turn t1+4.\n\nSet T_reach = t1+4 = t1 + H -1, so H-1=4, H=5.\n\nThen actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1+4}, but a_{t1+4} is at turn t1+4, which is when we are at y=9, but we choose an action, say U, but y=9, U would try to go to 10, but y max 9, so probably not allowed, or it stays? But in the movement, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, with y in [0,9], so if at y=9 and U, it should stay? But the rule says y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, but clamped to [0,9], I think.\n\nIn the update: \"y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t , where ... , y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9]\"\n\nIt says y_{t+1} ∈ [0,9], so if y_t=9 and U, y_{t+1} = min(9, 9+1) =9? But it says y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, and then it must be in [0,9], so probably it is bounded, so if y_t=9 and U, y_{t+1}=9.\n\nSimilarly for D at 0.\n\nBut in this case, at turn t1+4, y=9, we can choose S or something.\n\nBut for the position, at turn t1+4, we are at y=9.\n\nNow, with actions: a_{t1} = U (to go from y=5 to y=6 at next turn)\n\na_{t1+1} = U (to y=7)\n\na_{t1+2} = U (to y=8)\n\na_{t1+3} = U (to y=9)\n\nThen at turn t1+3, position is y=8? Let's see.\n\nAt turn t1 (ΔT=0), position y=5\n\nAfter a_{t1} = U, at turn t1+1 (ΔT=1), position y=6\n\nAfter a_{t1+1} = U, at turn t1+2 (ΔT=2), position y=7\n\nAfter a_{t1+2} = U, at turn t1+3 (ΔT=3), position y=8\n\nAfter a_{t1+3} = U, at turn t1+4 (ΔT=4), position y=9\n\nWe want to be at y=9 at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nHere at turn t1+4, y=9.\n\nSo t1 + H -1 = t1+4, so H-1=4, H=5.\n\nThen actions: a_{t1} to a_{t1+4}, but we have only specified up to a_{t1+3} to reach y=9 at t1+4.\n\na_{t1+4} is an action at turn t1+4, which doesn't affect position at t1+4.\n\nSo for the sequence, we need to include a_{t1+4}, but since we are already at y=9, we can set it to S.\n\nSimilarly, in the sequence for t=0 to H-1=4, so a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, a_{t1+2}, a_{t1+3}, a_{t1+4}\n\nBut with a_{t1} to a_{t1+3}, we go to y=9 at t1+4.\n\na_{t1+4} is extra.\n\nTo have position at t1 + H -1 = t1+4 be 9, so H-1=4, H=5.\n\nThen actions a_{t1} to a_{t1+4}.\n\na_{t1} to a_{t1+3} to move, and a_{t1+4} can be S.\n\nBut we need to check if at any turn we had collision.\n\nIn this path:\n\nAt turn t1 (ΔT=0): y=5, freeway 5, at ΔT=0, unsafe? Freeway 5 unsafe at ΔT=1 and 4, not at 0. At ΔT=0, as we computed, no car at 0, so safe.\n\nAt turn t1+1 (ΔT=1): y=6, freeway 6, always safe.\n\nAt turn t1+2 (ΔT=2): y=7, freeway 7, always safe.\n\nAt turn t1+3 (ΔT=3): y=8, freeway 8, at ΔT=3, safe as above.\n\nThen at turn t1+4 (ΔT=4): y=9, safe.\n\nSo no collision.\n\nWith H=5 actions: U,U,U,U,S or something.\n\nBut H=5, but we used only 4 U actions to move, with one extra S at the end.\n\nBut minimal H should be 4, since we can reach in 4 actions.\n\nWith H=4 actions: a_{t1} to a_{t1+3}\n\nThen after a_{t1+3}, at turn t1+4, position y_{t1+4}\n\nWe want y at turn t1 + H -1 = t1 + 4 -1 = t1+3 to be 9.\n\nWith H=4, T_reach = t1 + 4 -1 = t1+3.\n\nSo we want position at turn t1+3 to be 9.\n\nAt turn t1+3, y=9.\n\nHow to achieve that?\n\nStart at turn t1, y=5\n\nAfter a_{t1}, at turn t1+1, y=6\n\nAfter a_{t1+1}, at turn t1+2, y=7\n\nAfter a_{t1+2}, at turn t1+3, y=8\n\nThen to have at turn t1+3, y=9, it must be that from y=8 at turn t1+3, but y at turn t1+3 is before action, so to be 9 at turn t1+3, we need to have arrived at 9 from previous.\n\nAt turn t1+3, y=9, which means that at turn t1+2, we were at y=8 or y=9, and moved accordingly.\n\nIf at turn t1+2, y=8, and we do U, then at turn t1+3, y=9.\n\nSimilarly, if at turn t1+2, y=9, and S, then at turn t1+3, y=9.\n\nBut we start from y=5 at t1, so minimal is to go up.\n\nSo for example: at turn t1, y=5, do U, go to y=6 at t1+1\n\nAt t1+1, y=6, do U, go to y=7 at t1+2\n\nAt t1+2, y=7, do U, go to y=8 at t1+3? No.\n\nAt turn t1+2, position y=7\n\nThen after action a_{t1+2}, at turn t1+3, y=8 if a_{t1+2}=U? Let's clarify.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nAfter action a_T, y_{T+1} = y_T + Δy_T\n\nSo at turn t1+2, position y_{t1+2}\n\nThen after a_{t1+2}, y_{t1+3} = y_{t1+2} + Δy_{t1+2}\n\nTo have y_{t1+3} =9 at turn t1+3.\n\nFor H=4, T_reach = t1 + 4 -1 = t1+3.\n\ny_{t1+3} =9.\n\nThis is achieved if at turn t1+2, we are at y=8 or y=9, and choose action accordingly.\n\nBut we start from y=5 at t1.\n\nSo possible sequence:\n\nAt turn t1 (T=0), y=5, do a_{t1}=U, then at t1+1, y=6\n\nAt turn t1+1 (T=1), y=6, do a_{t1+1}=U, then at t1+2, y=7\n\nAt turn t1+2 (T=2), y=7, do a_{t1+2}=U, then at t1+3, y=8\n\nBut we want y at t1+3 to be 9, but here it is 8.\n\nTo have y at t1+3 be 9, we need at turn t1+2 to be at y=8 or y=9.\n\nFrom above, at t1+2 we are at y=7.\n\nWe need to be at y=8 or higher at turn t1+2.\n\nBut from start, at turn t1, y=5, after one action, at t1+1, y=6 max, after two actions, at t1+2, y=7 max, so cannot be at y=8 or 9 at turn t1+2.\n\nTherefore, with H=4 actions, it is impossible to be at y=9 at turn t1+3, because we start at y=5, and after 3 actions (to turn t1+3), we can be at y=5,6,7, or 8, but not 9, since each action changes y by at most 1.\n\nFrom turn t1 to turn t1+3, we have 3 actions: a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, a_{t1+2}, which affect y at t1+1, t1+2, t1+3.\n\nPosition at turn t1: y=5\n\nAfter a_{t1}, position at t1+1: y=5 + Δy_{t1}, so 4,5,6\n\nAfter a_{t1+1}, position at t1+2: y_{t1+1} + Δy_{t1+1}, so min 3, max 7? y from 0 to 9.\n\nAt turn t1+2: y from 0 to 9, but from start, with two actions, from y=5, can be from 3 to 7.\n\nThen after a_{t1+2}, position at t1+3: from y_{t1+2} + Δy_{t1+2}, so can be 2 to 8, or 9 if y_{t1+2}=8 and U, or y_{t1+2}=9 and S, etc.\n\nMax at t1+3 is 8 if we go up all, min is 2 if down all.\n\nCannot reach y=9 at turn t1+3 with start at y=5 at t1, because after 3 actions, we can reach y=8 at most (5+3=8).\n\ny=9 requires 4 up moves from 5, but we have only 3 actions to change position from t1 to t1+3.\n\nSpecifically, positions: at t1: y=5\n\nAt t1+1: after one action, y=4,5,6\n\nAt t1+2: after two actions, y=3,4,5,6,7\n\nAt t1+3: after three actions, y=2,3,4,5,6,7,8\n\nCannot be 9 at t1+3.\n\nTherefore, with H=4, we cannot reach y=9 at turn t1+3.\n\nMinimal possible to reach y=9 is at turn t1+4, with y=9 at that turn.\n\nThen for that, we need H such that t1 + H -1 = t1+4, so H-1=4, H=5.\n\nThen actions from a_{t1} to a_{t1+4}.\n\nWith a_{t1} to a_{t1+3} = U, and a_{t1+4} can be S, for example.\n\nAnd as above, it is safe.\n\nBut in the sequence, for turn t1+4, we are at y=9, and we choose S, so position stays.\n\nBut we need to output the actions.\n\nIn this case, H=5.\n\nBut is there a way with H=4? With H=4, we must reach at turn t1+3, but impossible as above.\n\nSo minimal H is 5.\n\nBut let's confirm the turn.\n\nWith H=5, T_reach = t1 + 5 -1 = t1+4.\n\nAt t1+4, y=9.\n\nActions: a_{t1}, a_{t1+1}, a_{t1+2}, a_{t1+3}, a_{t1+4}\n\nTo have y=9 at t1+4, we need to be at y=8 or 9 at t1+3 and move accordingly.\n\nFor example: a_{t1}=U, to y=6 at t1+1\n\na_{t1+1}=U, to y=7 at t1+2\n\na_{t1+2}=U, to y=8 at t1+3\n\na_{t1+3}=U, to y=9 at t1+4\n\nThen a_{t1+4} can be S, since at y=9.\n\nNow, at turn t1+3 (ΔT=3), we are at y=8, which is safe as before.\n\nIn the action sequence for H=5, we have five actions.\n\nBut we can have a shorter path? H=4 is impossible, so H=5 is minimal.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier by going down or something, but no, going down would take longer to reach y=9.\n\nFor example, if we go down to y=4, then we need more up moves.\n\nSo H=5 is minimal.\n\nIn this sequence, it seems safe, but let's double-check the turns.\n\nAt turn t1 (ΔT=0): y=5, freeway 5, safe as before.\n\nAction a_{t1}=U\n\nAt turn t1+1 (ΔT=1): y=6, freeway 6, always safe.\n\nAction a_{t1+1}=U\n\nAt turn t1+2 (ΔT=2): y=7, freeway 7, always safe.\n\nAction a_{t1+2}=U\n\nAt turn t1+3 (ΔT=3): y=8, freeway 8, at ΔT=3: car spans.\n\nFreeway 8, second car: at ΔT=3, span [-35 +6*3, -24 +6*3] = [-35+18, -24+18] = [-17,-6], 0 not in, safe.\n\nFirst car: [13+18,24+18]=[31,42], safe.\n\nAction a_{t1+3}=U\n\nAt turn t1+4 (ΔT=4): y=9, safe.\n\nThen action a_{t1+4}=S, but not necessary, but we have to specify.\n\nIn the sequence, for t=0 to 4, actions a_{t1} to a_{t1+4}.\n\nBut in the output, we need to list for each turn.\n\nNow, but we need to output for turn t1, t1+1, etc.\n\nIn the sequence, a_{t1+3} is U, which moves to y=9 at next turn.\n\nBut at turn t1+3, we are at y=8.\n\nIn the action list, it should be fine.\n\nIs there a problem at other points?\n\nFreeway 5 is unsafe at ΔT=1 and 4, but in this path, we are on y=5 only at ΔT=0, not at ΔT=1 or 4.\n\nSimilarly, y=8 at ΔT=3, not at 4 or 5.\n\nSo all safe.\n\nTherefore, with H=5, sequence: a_{t1}=U, a_{t1+1}=U, a_{t1+2}=U, a_{t1+3}=U, a_{t1+4}=S\n\nBut a_{t1+4} can be anything, S is fine.\n\nWe can set a_{t1+4}=S to stay.\n\nIn the output, it should be minimal H, which is 5.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach earlier with different actions.\n\nFor example, if we stay or move down, we might avoid some unsafe times, but since we are not on unsafe rows at unsafe times, it should be fine.\n\nSuppose we want to reach at turn t1+3, but impossible as y<=8.\n\nTurn t1+4 is earliest.\n\nWith H=5.\n\nPerhaps we can have a sequence with H=5 but different actions.\n\nBut the above seems fine.\n\nIn the sequence, for turn t1+4, action S, but since we reach at turn t1+4, which is T_reach, and we choose action, but position is already 9.\n\nIn the answer, we need to output the actions for the turns.\n\nNow, the cars on freeway 5 are unsafe at ΔT=1 and 4, but we are not on y=5 at those times.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nIn freeway 3,4,5 unsafe at ΔT=1, but y=6 is safe at that time.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nTherefore, minimal H is 5.\n\nSequence:\n\nTurn t1: a_{t1} = U\n\nTurn t1+1: a_{t1+1} = U\n\nTurn t1+2: a_{t1+2} = U\n\nTurn t1+3: a_{t1+3} = U\n\nTurn t1+4: a_{t1+4} = S\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut t1=49, so:\n\nTurn 49: a_{49} = U\n\nTurn 50: a_{50} = U\n\nTurn 51: a_{51} = U\n\nTurn 52: a_{52} = U\n\nTurn 53: a_{53} = S\n\nBut we need to write in terms of t1.\n\nIn the answer format, it says:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 + 1}\n\n...\n\nSo for this case.\n\nBut is there a way with H=4? No, as explained.\n\nPerhaps we can be at y=9 at an earlier turn by starting from lower, but no, we start at y=5, need to go up.\n\nAnother thing: at turn t1, we can choose to stay or down, but that would delay reaching y=9.\n\nFor example, if we stay at y=5 at turn t1, then at ΔT=1, y=5, but freeway 5 unsafe at ΔT=1, so collision.\n\nCannot stay at turn t1.\n\nIf we go down, worse.\n\nSo must move up or something.\n\nIn the direct path, it works.\n\nPerhaps we can go to y=9 faster, but impossible.\n\nSo I think H=5 is minimal.\n\nNow, in the sequence, for the last action, we set S.\n\nBut we can set U, but since y=9, it stays, but S is fine.\n\nIn the output.\n\nBut let's confirm the car states.\n\nAt turn ΔT=1, freeway 5 is unsafe, but we are on y=6, not y=5.\n\nSimilarly, at ΔT=4, freeway 5 unsafe, but we are on y=9 or y=8? At ΔT=4, in the sequence, at turn t1+4, y=9, not on freeway.\n\nAt turn t1+3, ΔT=3, y=8, freeway 8 safe.\n\nAll good.\n\nSo the sequence should be:\n\nTurn t_1: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 2: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 3: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 4: S\n\nWith H=5.\n\nBut in the action indices, for t=0 to 4.\n\nIn the answer format, we need to box it.\n\nBut t1=49, but we use t1.\n\nNow, the car on freeway 8 at ΔT=4 is unsafe, but we are not on it.\n\nIn freeway 8, unsafe at ΔT=4 and 5.\n\nAt ΔT=4, if on y=8, collision.\n\nBut in our path, at ΔT=4, we are at y=9, not on y=8.\n\nAt ΔT=3, we are at y=8, which is safe.\n\nThen we move to y=9 at ΔT=4.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nTherefore, this works.\n\nSo minimal H is 5.\n</think>\nThe minimal number of turns \\(H\\) to reach position \\((0, 9)\\) from the initial position \\((0, 5)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 49\\) is 5, with the sequence of actions achieving this in \\(H\\) turns.\n\nThe sequence of actions is as follows:\n- At turn \\(t_1 = 49\\), action \\(U\\) (up) is taken, moving the player to row \\(y = 6\\) at turn 50.\n- At turn \\(t_1 + 1 = 50\\), action \\(U\\) is taken, moving to row \\(y = 7\\) at turn 51.\n- At turn \\(t_1 + 2 = 51\\), action \\(U\\) is taken, moving to row \\(y = 8\\) at turn 52.\n- At turn \\(t_1 + 3 = 52\\), action \\(U\\) is taken, moving to row \\(y = 9\\) at turn 53.\n- At turn \\(t_1 + 4 = 53\\), action \\(S\\) (stay) is taken, as the player is already at \\(y = 9\\).\n\nThis sequence avoids collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\):\n- At turn 49 (\\( \\Delta T = 0 \\)): Position \\(y = 5\\) (freeway 5).

        "thinking": "<think>First, I need to get from (0,6) to (0,9) in as few turns as possible, avoiding cars on the freeways y=1 to y=8. The current turn is t_1 = 50. I have to output a sequence of actions: U for up, D for down, or S for stay, and the minimal number of turns H.\n\nThe player moves vertically: U increases y by 1, D decreases y by 1, S keeps y the same. y must stay between 0 and 9, inclusive.\n\nCars move horizontally on their freeways. For each car, I'm given its position at turn t_1=50. The car positions are given with head and tail, and direction and speed. I need to compute where the car will be at future turns to avoid collisions.\n\nCollision happens if at turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and for that freeway, there's a car such that 0 is in its span at that turn. The span is the set of x-coordinates covered by the car.\n\nImportantly, when the player moves to a new y, they are not on that new y until the next turn. So, at turn T, if I move from y to y+1, I'm still on y for collision purposes at turn T, and only on y+1 at turn T+1.\n\nThe goal is to reach y=9. Since the grid is only y from 0 to 9, and we start at y=6, we need to go up to y=9, which is 3 steps up, but we have to avoid the cars on the way.\n\ny=6 is the starting position, but y=6 has a freeway? No, the freeways are from y=1 to y=8. y=0 and y=9 are not freeways, I think, so no cars there. But the player can be on y=0 or y=9.\n\nThe problem says: \"freeways y = 1, …, 8\", so y=0 and y=9 have no cars, so it's safe there. But we need to reach (0,9), so y=9 is the target.\n\nNow, at turn T, collision depends on the player's y_T and the cars on that freeway at turn T.\n\nLet me list the current car states at t=50.\n\nFor each freeway, I have cars with (head, tail, direction, speed).\n\nDirection: left or right. For left-moving, head is on the right, I assume, since it moves left, so as time increases, the position decreases. Similarly for right-moving, head is on the left, position increases.\n\nFrom the update rules:\n\n- Left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → at T, [h - s(T-t_1), τ - s(T-t_1)]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 1: (48, 83, left, 36)\n\nh=48, τ=83? That seems odd. If it's left-moving, and span is [h,τ], but if it's moving left, and head is at h, tail at τ, but for left-moving, head should be the front, which is decreasing.\n\nPerhaps the span is given as [min, max] or something? Let me read carefully.\n\nIn the car update:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → at T, [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nBut here for freeway 1, h=48, τ=83, left, s=36.\n\nIf it's left-moving, and [h,τ] with h=48, τ=83, that would imply tail is at 83, head at 48? But if moving left, head should be at higher x, decreasing.\n\nI think there might be inconsistency in notation.\n\nLook at the direction: for left-moving, it says Span(t_1) = [h, τ] and then moves to [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT], so as ΔT increases, both decrease, so h and τ are the positions at t_1, with h and τ, and since it decreases, for left-moving, head is at the right, so h should be greater than τ? In this case, h=48, τ=83, but 48 < 83, so if [48,83], and moving left, at T, [48 - sΔT, 83 - sΔT], so the span shifts left.\n\nBut typically, for a car, the head and tail: if moving left, head is at the left when facing left? I need to clarify the coordinate system.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think of the span as the interval covered.\n\nFor collision, we care about whether 0 is in the span at time T.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → at T, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nIn the table, for freeway 3,4,5: (0, -11, right, 12), etc.\n\nFor right-moving, Span(t_1) = [τ, h], so τ and h with τ < h, I assume.\n\nIn freeway 3, it has (0, -11, right, 12), so τ=0, h=-11? But -11 < 0, so if [τ, h] = [0, -11], but that would be empty or invalid since 0 > -11, interval [min,max] should have min <= max.\n\nThis is confusing. Let's parse the notation.\n\nFor right-moving: it says Span(t_1) = [τ, h] and then at T, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nBut in the car state, it's listed as (head, tail, direction, speed). But in the span definition, for right-moving, it's [τ, h], which might be tail and head.\n\nI think there's inconsistency in the terminology.\n\nLook at freeway 6: (30, 19, right, 6)\n\nIf direction right, and (30,19), but 30 > 19, so if span is [τ, h] for right-moving, τ should be min, h max.\n\nIn the text: for right-moving, \"Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → Span(T) = [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\"\n\nAnd it says \"head is at h, tail is at τ\" at the beginning: \"for car k on freeway i, suppose its head is at h, tail is at τ\"\n\nThen for left-moving, span [h, τ] moving to [h - sΔT, τ - sΔT]\n\nFor right-moving, span [τ, h] moving to [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT]\n\nBut in the state, for left-moving on freeway 1: (48, 83, left, 36), so head h=48, tail τ=83.\n\nBut if head is at 48, tail at 83, and moving left, that means the car is oriented with head at smaller x, tail at larger x, but moving left, so the head is on the left side? Let's think.\n\nSuppose at t_1, head position is h, tail position is τ.\n\nFor left-moving car, it moves decreasing x, so if head is at h, and it moves left, then at future time, head is at h - sΔT.\n\nSimilarly, tail is at τ - sΔT.\n\nThe span of the car is from min to max of head and tail? Not necessarily, because the car has a length.\n\nThe span is the interval covered by the car, so for collision, we care if 0 is in [min(head,tail), max(head,tail)] at time T.\n\nFor left-moving car at t_1, head=48, tail=83, so min is 48, max is 83, so span [48,83] at t_1.\n\nThen at T, [48 - sΔT, 83 - sΔT] with s=36.\n\nSimilarly for right-moving, head and tail: for freeway 3, (0, -11, right, 12), so head h=0, tail τ=-11, and for right-moving, span is [τ, h] = [-11, 0] at t_1? But the text says for right-moving, span(t_1) = [τ, h], so with τ and h, but in this case τ=-11, h=0, so min τ=-11, max h=0, so span [-11,0].\n\nThen at T, [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-11 +12ΔT, 0 +12ΔT]\n\nSimilarly for other cars.\n\nIn freeway 6, (30,19, right,6), so head=30, tail=19? But for right-moving, span [τ, h] = [19,30] since τ=19, h=30, I assume min to max.\n\nIn the list, it's (head, tail), so for freeway 6: (30,19, right,6), so head=30, tail=19, and since right-moving, span [τ, h] = [19,30] at t_1.\n\nThen at T, [19 +6ΔT, 30 +6ΔT]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nLet's list all cars at t_1=50 for each freeway.\n\nFreeway 1: one car, left-moving, head=48, tail=83, s=36, so span at t_1: min(48,83)=48, max=83, so [48,83], moving left.\n\nFreeway 2: same as freeway 1, (48,83,left,36), so [48,83]\n\nFreeway 3: three cars: (0,-11,right,12), (-36,-47,right,12), (48,37,right,12)\n\nFor each:\n\nFirst car: head=0, tail=-11, right-moving, span [τ,h] = [-11,0] at t_1\n\nSecond car: head=-36, tail=-47, right-moving, span [τ,h] = [-47,-36] since τ=-47, h=-36\n\nThird car: head=48, tail=37, right-moving, span [τ,h] = [37,48]\n\nFreeway 4: same as freeway 3, three cars: (0,-11,right,12), (-36,-47,right,12), (48,37,right,12)\n\nFreeway 5: same as freeway 3 and 4.\n\nFreeway 6: one car (30,19,right,6), head=30, tail=19, right-moving, span [τ,h] = [19,30]\n\nFreeway 7: one car (30,19,right,6), same as freeway 6.\n\nFreeway 8: two cars (30,19,right,6) and (-18,-29,right,6)\n\nFirst car: (30,19,right,6), span [19,30]\n\nSecond car: (-18,-29,right,6), head=-18, tail=-29, right-moving, span [τ,h] = [-29,-18]\n\nNow, at any turn T, for a freeway, collision occurs if the player is on that freeway at turn T, and for some car on that freeway, 0 is in its span at T.\n\nThe span at T depends on ΔT = T - t_1 = T - 50.\n\nFor each freeway, I need to find when 0 is covered by any car for that freeway at time T.\n\nSince the player moves vertically, and we need to go from y=6 to y=9, passing through y=7 and y=8, but we can stay or move down, but since we want minimal turns, probably we should go up directly, but we have to avoid being on a freeway when a car is at x=0.\n\nThe player is at x=0 always, I assume, since it's (0,y), and the cars are on the freeways, so collision when y_T = k for k=1 to 8, and 0 in some car's span on freeway k at time T.\n\nAt time T, if y_T = k, and freeway k has a car with 0 in its span at T.\n\nTo avoid collision, we need that when we are on y=k, for k=1 to 8, at that turn, 0 is not in any car's span for that freeway.\n\nSince we move at turn boundaries, we can choose to be on a freeway only at certain times when it's safe.\n\nWe start at y=6 at turn 50.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\ny=9 has no cars, so once we are on y=9, we are safe, and we stop.\n\nSimilarly, y=0 has no cars, but we start at y=6.\n\nThe minimal H: since we need to go from 6 to 9, at least 3 turns if we go up each turn, but we might need to wait or go down to avoid collisions.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, the times when it is unsafe, i.e., when there is a car with 0 in its span.\n\nLet ΔT = T - 50.\n\nFor each freeway, find for which T, 0 is in some car's span.\n\nStart with freeway 1: y=1\n\nOne car: left-moving, span at T: [48 - 36ΔT, 83 - 36ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 48 - 36ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 83 - 36ΔT\n\nSince 48 - 36ΔT ≤ 0 and 0 ≤ 83 - 36ΔT\n\nFirst inequality: 48 - 36ΔT ≤ 0 => 48 ≤ 36ΔT => ΔT ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so ΔT ≥ 2 since ΔT integer? T is turn number, so ΔT integer, I assume.\n\nT is turn, so ΔT = T - 50, integer.\n\nSo 48 - 36ΔT ≤ 0 => 36ΔT ≥ 48 => ΔT ≥ 48/36 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333, so since ΔT integer, ΔT ≥ 2\n\nSecond inequality: 0 ≤ 83 - 36ΔT => 36ΔT ≤ 83 => ΔT ≤ 83/36 ≈ 2.305, so ΔT ≤ 2\n\nΔT ≥ 2 and ΔT ≤ 2, so only ΔT=2.\n\nAt ΔT=2, span [48-72, 83-72] = [-24, 11], and 0 is between -24 and 11, yes.\n\nAt other times, not.\n\nFor ΔT=1: [48-36,83-36] = [12,47], 0 not in [12,47]\n\nΔT=3: [48-108,83-108] = [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSo freeway 1 is unsafe only at ΔT=2, i.e., T=52.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 2 is identical to freeway 1, same car, so also unsafe only at T=52.\n\nNow freeway 3: y=3\n\nThree cars:\n\nFirst car: right-moving, span at T: [ -11 + 12ΔT, 0 + 12ΔT ] = [ -11 + 12ΔT, 12ΔT ]\n\n0 in span if -11 + 12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ 12ΔT\n\nLeft: -11 + 12ΔT ≤ 0 => 12ΔT ≤ 11 => ΔT ≤ 11/12 ≈ 0.916, so ΔT ≤ 0 since integer? ΔT ≥0, T≥50.\n\nΔT = T-50, T≥50, ΔT ≥0.\n\n-11 +12ΔT ≤0 => 12ΔT ≤11 => ΔT ≤ 11/12 <1, so ΔT ≤0, but ΔT≥0, so ΔT=0\n\nAt ΔT=0, span [-11,0], 0 is included.\n\n0 ≤ 12ΔT is always true for ΔT≥0? 0 ≤ 12ΔT, since 12ΔT ≥0 for ΔT≥0, so true.\n\nSo for first car, 0 in span only when ΔT=0.\n\nAt ΔT=0, T=50.\n\nSecond car: span at T: [ -47 +12ΔT, -36 +12ΔT ]\n\n0 in span if -47 +12ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -36 +12ΔT\n\nLeft: -47 +12ΔT ≤0 => 12ΔT ≤47 => ΔT ≤ 47/12 ≈ 3.916, so ΔT ≤3\n\nRight: 0 ≤ -36 +12ΔT => 12ΔT ≥36 => ΔT ≥3\n\nSo ΔT ≥3 and ΔT ≤3, so only ΔT=3.\n\nAt ΔT=3, span [-47+36, -36+36] = [-11,0], 0 in it.\n\nThird car: span at T: [37 +12ΔT, 48 +12ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 37+12ΔT ≤0 ≤48+12ΔT\n\nBut 37+12ΔT ≥37 >0 for ΔT≥0, so left inequality false, 0 cannot be ≤ lower bound which is at least 37, so 0 never in span for this car.\n\nSo for freeway 3, unsafe when first car has 0 at ΔT=0, or second car at ΔT=3.\n\nAt ΔT=0, T=50; ΔT=3, T=53.\n\nFreeway 4 and 5 are identical to freeway 3, so same unsafe times: T=50 and T=53 for each.\n\nNow freeway 6: y=6\n\nOne car: right-moving, (30,19,right,6), span at T: [19 +6ΔT, 30 +6ΔT]\n\n0 in span if 19+6ΔT ≤0 ≤30+6ΔT\n\nLeft: 19+6ΔT ≤0 => 6ΔT ≤ -19, impossible since ΔT≥0, 6ΔT≥0, -19<0, so false.\n\nThus, 0 never in span, so freeway 6 is always safe. No car covers x=0 at any time.\n\nSimilarly, freeway 7: same as freeway 6, one car (30,19,right,6), so also always safe.\n\nNow freeway 8: y=8\n\nTwo cars:\n\nFirst car: (30,19,right,6), same as above, span [19+6ΔT, 30+6ΔT], 0 never in span.\n\nSecond car: (-18,-29,right,6), head=-18? tail=-29, right-moving.\n\nSpan at T: [τ + sΔT, h + sΔT] = [-29 +6ΔT, -18 +6ΔT]\n\n0 in span if -29 +6ΔT ≤ 0 ≤ -18 +6ΔT\n\nLeft: -29 +6ΔT ≤0 => 6ΔT ≤29 => ΔT ≤ 29/6 ≈4.833, so ΔT ≤4\n\nRight: 0 ≤ -18 +6ΔT => 6ΔT ≥18 => ΔT ≥3\n\nSo ΔT ≥3 and ΔT ≤4, so ΔT=3 or 4.\n\nAt ΔT=3: [-29+18, -18+18] = [-11,0], 0 in it.\n\nAt ΔT=4: [-29+24, -18+24] = [-5,6], 0 in it.\n\nSo unsafe at T=53 and T=54.\n\nNow summarize unsafe times for each freeway:\n\ny=1: unsafe at T=52\n\ny=2: same as y=1, unsafe at T=52\n\ny=3: unsafe at T=50 and T=53\n\ny=4: same as y=3, unsafe at T=50 and T=53\n\ny=5: same, unsafe at T=50 and T=53\n\ny=6: always safe\n\ny=7: always safe\n\ny=8: unsafe at T=53 and T=54\n\nWe start at turn 50, position y=6.\n\nAt turn 50, y=6, which is safe, since y=6 always safe.\n\nWe need to reach y=9.\n\nPossible actions: we can move up (U), down (D), or stay (S).\n\nEach action changes or keeps y.\n\nThe sequence of actions determines the path.\n\nWe want minimal H, so probably go up as fast as possible, but avoid unsafe times.\n\nStart at T=50, y=6, safe.\n\nNow, we can choose action at T=50 to go to next y.\n\nLet me denote the turn and the y at that turn.\n\nAt turn T, we are at y_T, and we choose action a_T, which determines y_{T+1}.\n\nBut collision is checked at each turn T based on y_T and cars at T.\n\nAt turn 50, y=6, safe.\n\nNow, we need to be at y=9 at some turn, say at turn T_final, with y_{T_final} =9.\n\nSince y=9 has no cars, it's safe whenever we are there.\n\nThe minimal H is the number of turns from start to end.\n\nH is the number of actions, from t= t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and after H actions, we are at (0,9).\n\nAfter sequence of H actions, at turn t_1 + H -1, we are at y=9? Let's see.\n\nStart at turn t_1, position given.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, at turn t_1+1, we move to new position.\n\nThe sequence: at turn t_1, we are at (0, y_{t_1}), then we take action a_{t_1}, which determines y_{t_1 +1}, and so on, up to a_{t_1 + H -1}, after which at turn (t_1 + H -1) +1? Let's clarify.\n\nThe state at turn t is after the action or before?\n\nThe player update: y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t, where Δy_t depends on a_t.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at position y_t, then we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nCollision at turn t: depends on y_t and cars at turn t.\n\nSo at each turn t, we are at y_t, and we check if collision occurs based on y_t and the cars on freeway y_t at time t.\n\nThen we take action a_t, go to y_{t+1}, and so on.\n\nWe start at turn t_1=50, y_{50}=6.\n\nWe need to have y_{t_1 + H -1} =9? After H actions, from t=50 to t=50+H-1, we take H actions, and the position after H actions is at turn 50 + H.\n\nDefine:\n\nAfter k actions, we are at turn 50 + k.\n\nAt turn 50 + k, y_{50+k} is the position.\n\nStart: turn 50, y=6.\n\nAfter 0 actions, at turn 50.\n\nAfter first action a_{50}, at turn 51, y_{51} = y_{50} + Δy_{50}\n\nSimilarly, after H actions, at turn 50 + H, y_{50+H}.\n\nWe need y_{50+H} =9 for some H.\n\nH is the number of turns, I think.\n\nThe problem says: \"minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\"\n\nSequence from t=0 to H-1, so a_{t_1} to a_{t_1 + H -1}\n\nAfter these actions, at turn t_1 + H, we are at the position.\n\nStart: turn t_1, position given.\n\nTake action a_{t_1}, move to position at turn t_1 +1.\n\nTake action a_{t_1 +1}, move to position at turn t_1 +2.\n\n...\n\nTake action a_{t_1 + H -1}, move to position at turn t_1 + H.\n\nWe need position at turn t_1 + H to be (0,9).\n\nSo H is the number of actions, and we reach at turn t_1 + H.\n\nIn terms of turns, from start turn to end turn, it takes H turns? From turn t_1 to turn t_1 + H, that's H steps, but the position changes after each action.\n\nAt turn t_1, we are at start position.\n\nAfter one action, at turn t_1 +1, new position.\n\nAfter H actions, at turn t_1 + H, final position.\n\nWe need y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nThe sequence of actions is for turns t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nNow back to the game.\n\nStart at turn 50, y=6, which is safe.\n\nWe need to go to y=9.\n\nThe direct way: go up to y=7, then y=8, then y=9.\n\nBut we have to avoid being on unsafe freeways at unsafe times.\n\nFirst, y=6 is always safe, as we saw.\n\ny=7 is always safe.\n\ny=8 is unsafe at T=53 and 54.\n\ny=9 is safe.\n\nAlso, y=3,4,5 unsafe at T=50 and 53, but we start at y=6, so not on them at T=50.\n\nNow, we are at T=50, y=6.\n\nWe take action at T=50 to go to y_{51}.\n\nPossible actions: U to y=7, D to y=5, S to y=6.\n\nSince we want to go up, probably U or S, but S might delay.\n\nMinimal H, so we should go up when possible.\n\nBut we need to avoid unsafe states.\n\nNow, at T=51, we could be at y=7 if we go U at T=50, or y=6 if S, or y=5 if D.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nThe unsafe times are at specific turns.\n\nSince y=6 and y=7 are always safe, we can stay there safely.\n\ny=8 is unsafe only at T=53 and 54.\n\nWe need to be on y=8 at some point to go to y=9.\n\nBut we must not be on y=8 at T=53 or T=54.\n\nSimilarly, for other freeways, but since we start at y=6 and go up, we might not need to go to lower y.\n\ny=5 is unsafe at T=50 and T=53, but T=50 is past, we are at T=50 now, y=6, so not on y=5 at T=50.\n\nSimilarly, y=3 and y=4 unsafe at same times.\n\nBut since we are going up, we can avoid going down, I think.\n\nNow, let's plan the path.\n\nWe need to reach y=9 by some turn.\n\nThe earliest possible: at T=50, we can go U to y=7 at T=51.\n\nThen at T=51, we are at y=7, safe.\n\nThen we can go U to y=8 at T=52.\n\nAt T=52, we are at y=8.\n\nBut y=8 is unsafe at T=53 and 54, but T=52 is not unsafe? y=8 unsafe at T=53 and 54, not at T=52.\n\nAt T=52, is y=8 safe?\n\nFrom earlier, freeway 8 unsafe at T=53 and 54, so at T=52, it should be safe.\n\nLet me confirm.\n\nFreeway 8: cars:\n\nFirst car: [19+6ΔT, 30+6ΔT], at ΔT= T-50, T=52, ΔT=2, [19+12,30+12]=[31,42], 0 not in.\n\nSecond car: [-29+6ΔT, -18+6ΔT], at ΔT=2, [-29+12, -18+12]=[-17,-6], 0 not in.\n\nSo yes, at T=52, y=8 is safe.\n\nThen at T=52, we are at y=8, safe.\n\nThen we can go U to y=9 at T=53.\n\nAt T=53, we are at y=9, which is safe, no cars.\n\nAnd we have reached y=9 at T=53.\n\nNow, the actions:\n\nStart T=50, y=6.\n\nAction a_{50}: U, so y_{51} =7\n\nThen at T=51, action a_{51}: U, so y_{52} =8\n\nThen at T=52, action a_{52}: U, so y_{53} =9\n\nWe reach at T=53.\n\nH=3 actions: from t=50 to t=52, actions a_{50}, a_{51}, a_{52}, and at turn 53, y=9.\n\nSequence: a_{50}=U, a_{51}=U, a_{52}=U\n\nNow, check if any collision.\n\nAt T=50: y=6, safe.\n\nAt T=51: y=7, safe (y=7 always safe)\n\nAt T=52: y=8, we said safe at T=52.\n\nAt T=53: y=9, safe.\n\nBut we only care up to when we reach, but at T=53 we are at y=9, so no issue.\n\nIs there any problem?\n\ny=8 is unsafe at T=53, but at T=53 we are at y=9, not on y=8.\n\nSimilarly, other unsafe times don't affect us.\n\nIn this path, we didn't encounter any unsafe state.\n\nAnd H=3, which is minimal since we need to increase y by 3.\n\nBut is it possible to do in fewer? From y=6 to y=9, minimum 3 actions, so H=3 should be achievable, and we have a sequence.\n\nBut let me confirm the times.\n\nT=50: y=6, safe\n\nAfter a_{50}=U, to y=7 at T=51\n\nT=51: y=7, safe\n\nAfter a_{51}=U, to y=8 at T=52\n\nT=52: y=8, safe, as above\n\nAfter a_{52}=U, to y=9 at T=53\n\nT=53: y=9, safe.\n\nNo collision.\n\nBut earlier I thought y=8 unsafe at T=53, but we are not on it at T=53.\n\nSimilarly, at T=50, y=3 is unsafe, but we are on y=6.\n\nSo seems fine.\n\nBut is there a reason we cannot go up directly? For example, if at some point we need to avoid, but in this case, it works.\n\nPerhaps I should check if we can go faster, but H=3 is minimum.\n\nMaybe stay or something, but no need.\n\nBut let me see the car on y=6 and y=7: always safe, so no issue.\n\nPerhaps at T=52, when we are on y=8, it is safe, as computed.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's list all unsafe times again.\n\ny=1 unsafe only at T=52\n\ny=2 at T=52\n\ny=3 unsafe at T=50 and T=53\n\ny=4 at T=50 and T=53\n\ny=5 at T=50 and T=53\n\ny=6 always safe\n\ny=7 always safe\n\ny=8 unsafe at T=53 and T=54\n\nIn our path, we are on y=8 at T=52, which is safe, and we leave to y=9 at T=53, so not on y=8 at T=53.\n\nSimilarly, no conflict.\n\nPerhaps we could go directly to y=9 faster, but impossible, since from y=6, need at least three moves.\n\nUnless we start at y=6, and go up three times.\n\nBut in this case, it works.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we do at T=53.\n\nBut let me see if at T=50, we can go to y=7 directly.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps there is a car at some point, but in this path, all clear.\n\nBut freeway 6 has cars, but we said 0 never covered, so safe.\n\nSimilarly for 7.\n\nIn freeway 6, car is at [19+6ΔT,30+6ΔT], which for ΔT>=0, min is 19>0, so 0 not covered.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if we need to wait for some reason, but here no need.\n\nAnother thing: when we move, at the turn we move, we are not on the new freeway until next turn.\n\nIn this case, for example, when we move from y to y+1 at turn T, at turn T we are still on y, and we move to y+1 at T+1.\n\nIn collision check, at turn T, we are on y, so if y is freeway, we check cars at T.\n\nIn our sequence:\n\nAt T=50: on y=6, safe.\n\nAction U: so at T=51, on y=7.\n\nAt T=51: on y=7, safe.\n\nAction U: at T=52, on y=8.\n\nAt T=52: on y=8, safe as computed.\n\nAction U: at T=53, on y=9.\n\nAll good.\n\nPerhaps we can reach earlier, but T=53 is after 3 actions.\n\nStart at T=50, after 0 actions.\n\nAfter 1 action, at T=51, y=7.\n\nAfter 2 actions, at T=52, y=8.\n\nAfter 3 actions, at T=53, y=9.\n\nYes.\n\nIs there a way with H=2? Then at T=52, y must be 9.\n\nBut from y=6 at T=50, with one action to T=51, y could be 7 (if U), or 6 (S), or 5 (D), all less than 9.\n\nThen at T=51, with second action, to T=52, y could be at most 8 if from 7 with U, or 9 if from 8, but we can't reach y=8 at T=51.\n\nAt T=51, y<=7 if we start from 6.\n\nSo impossible to reach y=9 at T=52. Min at T=53.\n\nSo H=3 is minimal.\n\nAnd we have a sequence.\n\nBut in the answer, we need to output the actions for turns starting from t_1.\n\nSo for turn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nBut the sequence is a_{50}, a_{51}, a_{52}\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut let me make sure there is no hidden issue.\n\nPerhaps on y=8 at T=52, but freeway 8 has cars, but at T=52, ΔT=2, as above, safe.\n\nMaybe I miscomputed the car positions.\n\nFor freeway 8 at T=52, ΔT=2.\n\nFirst car: [19+6*2, 30+6*2] = [19+12,30+12]=[31,42], not including 0.\n\nSecond car: [-29+12, -18+12] = [-17,-6], not including 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAt T=53, ΔT=3, first car [19+18,30+18]=[37,48], no.\n\nSecond car [-29+18, -18+18]=[-11,0], 0 included, unsafe.\n\nBut we are not on it at T=53.\n\nSimilarly, other freeways unsafe at T=53, like y=3,4,5, but we are on y=9.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nPerhaps we could go slower, but no need.\n\nSuppose we stay at y=6 for one turn.\n\nAt T=50, y=6, action S, then at T=51, y=6.\n\nThen we can go to y=7 at T=52, etc., but that would take more turns, H larger.\n\nSimilarly, if we go down, worse.\n\nSo minimal is H=3.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is:\n\nTurn 50: U\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nAnd we reach at turn 53.\n\nNow, in the answer format.\n\nThe problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\"\n\nSo for t from 0 to H-1, a_{t_1 + t}\n\nH=3, so t=0,1,2\n\na_{50+0} = a_{50} = U\n\na_{50+1} = a_{51} = U\n\na_{50+2} = a_{52} = U\n\nIn the box, it should be:\n\nTurn t_1: a_{t_1}  which is Turn 50: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 1: a_{t_1 +1}  Turn 51: U\n\nTurn t_1 + 2: a_{t_1 +2}  Turn 52: U\n\nAnd that's it.\n\nBut in the sequence, it goes up to a_{t_1 + H -1} = a_{52}, since H-1=2.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, I think that's the answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's see if we can reach at T=52, but impossible, as above.\n\nOr with different path.\n\nSuppose we go to y=7 at T=51, then stay at y=7 for one turn.\n\nAt T=51, y=7, action S, then at T=52, y=7.\n\nThen at T=52, action U to y=8 at T=53.\n\nBut at T=53, y=8 is unsafe? y=8 unsafe at T=53.\n\nAt T=53, if we are on y=8, collision.\n\nThen we need to go to y=9 at T=54.\n\nBut that takes longer.\n\nFor example: T=50: y=6, U to y=7 at T=51\n\nT=51: y=7, S, so y=7 at T=52? At T=51, we are at y=7, take action S, then at T=52, still y=7.\n\nThen at T=52, take U, to y=8 at T=53.\n\nBut at T=53, y=8, which is unsafe, since freeway 8 unsafe at T=53.\n\nThen collision.\n\nTo avoid, we could stay at y=7 longer or something.\n\nBut in our direct path, we don't have that issue.\n\nGo directly to y=8 at T=52, which is safe, then to y=9 at T=53.\n\nYes.\n\nIf we go to y=8 earlier, but from y=6 at T=50, to y=7 at T=51, then to y=8 at T=52, that's the earliest.\n\nWe could go to y=5 or something, but no need.\n\nSo I think H=3 with three U's is fine.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{c} \\text{Turn } 50: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 51: U \\\\ \\text{Turn } 52: U \\end{array} }\n\nIn the format, it says \"Turn t_1: a_{t_1}\" etc., so we use the numbers.\n\nSince t_1=50, it's fine.\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\nThe goal is to reach position (0, 9) from the initial position (0, 6) at turn 50 in the minimal number of turns \\(H\\), avoiding collisions with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\n### Analysis of Car Movements and Unsafe Times\nThe car positions and movements are analyzed based on the given states at turn 50. The span of each car at turn \\(T\\) is computed using \\(\\Delta T = T - 50\\). A freeway is unsafe at turn \\(T\\) if \\(0\\) is in the span of any car on that freeway at \\(T\\).

        "thinking": "<think>First, the player starts at (0, 7) at turn t_1 = 51. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns, avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8. The player moves vertically: U for up (+1 in y), D for down (-1 in y), or S for stay (y unchanged). y must stay between 0 and 9.\n\nThe car positions are given for each freeway. Cars move horizontally, and collision happens only if the player is on a freeway y at turn T, and for that freeway, 0 is in the car's span at that turn. The span changes over time based on direction and speed.\n\nImportant point: when you move to a new y, you are not on that new y until the next turn. So at turn T, if you move to y_{T+1}, you are still on y_T during turn T, and you only occupy y_{T+1} starting from turn T+1. So for collision check at turn T, we care about the freeway y_T, not y_{T+1}.\n\nThe player position at turn t is y_t. At turn T, the player is on freeway y_T, and we need to check if 0 is in the span of any car on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nCars are on specific freeways, so for each turn, we only care about cars on the current freeway y_t.\n\nThe car states are given for freeways 1 to 8.\n\nLet me list out the car states clearly:\n\nFreeway 1: one car: head=12, tail=47, direction=left, speed=36\n\nBut direction left means it's moving left, so head and tail decrease over time. Span is [h, τ] for left-moving, I think? Let's see the update.\n\nFrom the rule:\n\nLeft-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] → Span(T) = [h - s*(T-t_1), τ - s*(T-t_1)]\n\nIn this case, for freeway 1: head h=12, tail τ=47? That seems odd because usually head should be the front, but for left-moving, if it's moving left, head should be smaller than tail? I think there might be confusion in notation.\n\nLook at the rule:\n\nFor left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] and it moves to [h - s dt, τ - s dt]\n\nBut in the example, for freeway 1, h=12, τ=47, and direction left. If it's moving left, and h=12, τ=47, that means at t_1, the car is from x=12 to x=47? But if it's moving left, decreasing x, so head at left end, so smaller x is head.\n\nTypically, for left-moving, the head is at smaller x, tail at larger x.\n\nHere Span(t_1) = [h, τ] = [12,47], so from x=12 to x=47, and moving left, so at time T, [12 - s(T-t_1), 47 - s(T-t_1)]\n\nSimilarly, for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] → [τ + s dt, h + s dt], so in this notation, for right-moving, τ is the tail, h is the head, so [τ, h] means from left to right? Let's see the example.\n\nFor freeway 3, for example: (12,1,right,12), so h=12? tail τ=1? but it says (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nIn the car state: it's listed as (head h, tail τ, direction d, speed s)\n\nFor right-moving: direction right, so head should be to the right.\n\nIn the span for right-moving: Span(t_1) = [τ, h] and moves to [τ + s dt, h + s dt], so τ is the left end, h is the right end.\n\nSimilarly for left-moving: Span(t_1) = [h, τ] with h left end, τ right end, moves to [h - s dt, τ - s dt]\n\nIn freeway 1: (12,47,left,36), so h=12 (left head), τ=47 (right tail), moving left.\n\nAt time T, span is [12 - 36*(T-51), 47 - 36*(T-51)]\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nNow collision at turn T if player is on freeway k, and for that freeway, 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at turn T.\n\nPlayer starts at y=7 at t=51.\n\nGoal is to reach y=9.\n\nSince y=9 is the top, and we start at y=7, we need to move up twice to go to y=8 then y=9.\n\nBut there are cars on y=1 to 8, so we need to avoid being on a freeway when a car covers x=0 at that turn.\n\nAlso, we can move up, down, or stay, so we might need to wait or move down to avoid collisions, but since we want minimal turns, we probably want to go up as fast as possible, but might need to delay if there's a car coming.\n\nFirst, let's find the minimal H. Since we start at y=7, to reach y=9, we need at least 2 moves up, so H >=2. But if we can go directly in 2 turns, that would be best, but we need to check if it's possible without collision.\n\nPossible actions: at each turn, we choose U, D, or S.\n\nIf we do U at t=51, we go to y=8 at t=52? Let's see the position update.\n\nPlayer position: at turn t, position is y_t.\n\nAfter action at t, y_{t+1} = y_t + Δy_t.\n\nSo at turn t, we are at y_t, we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nFor collision at turn T, we are at y_T, and we check cars on freeway y_T at turn T.\n\nNow, for turn T=51, we are at y=7.\n\nWe need to check if at t=51, on freeway 7, is there a car such that 0 in span.\n\nSimilarly for each turn.\n\nFirst, let's find for each freeway, when 0 is covered by cars.\n\nSince cars move at constant speed, we can find for each car the times when it covers x=0.\n\nBut for a given freeway, we need to check all cars on that freeway.\n\nStart with freeway 7, since we start there.\n\nFreeway 7: cars: (36,25,right,6) and (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nFirst, direction right, so for each car, span at t_1=51.\n\nCar 1: head h=36, tail τ=25? But for right-moving, span is [τ, h] = [tail, head], so left end τ, right end h.\n\nIn the state, it's (head h, tail τ, ...), so for right-moving, head h is the right end, tail τ is the left end.\n\nSo for car on freeway 7: (36,25,right,6), so head h=36 (right end), tail τ=25 (left end)? But 25 to 36, that's increasing, so left end 25, right end 36.\n\nThen span at t_1=51: [τ, h] = [25, 36]\n\nAt time T, span = [τ + s(T-t_1), h + s(T-t_1)] = [25 + 6*(T-51), 36 + 6*(T-51)]\n\nSimilarly, second car: (-12,-23,right,6), so tail τ=-23, head h=-12, so span at t_1: [-23, -12]\n\nAt T: [-23 + 6*(T-51), -12 + 6*(T-51)]\n\nNow, 0 is in span if min <= 0 <= max.\n\nFor first car: 25 + 6(T-51) <= 0 <= 36 + 6(T-51)? Let's solve.\n\n0 in [a,b] if a <= 0 <= b.\n\nSo for car1: 25 + 6(T-51) <= 0 and 0 <= 36 + 6(T-51)\n\nBut 25 + 6dt <= 0 and 0 <= 36 + 6dt, where dt=T-51.\n\nSince 25 + 6dt <=0 implies dt <= -25/6 ≈ -4.166, but dt >=0 since T>=51, so 25 + 6dt >0 for all T>=51, so 0 <= 36 + 6dt is always true since 36 + 6dt >=36>0, and 25+6dt >=25>0, so 0 is never <= 25+6dt because left end is 25+6dt which is at least 25>0, so 0 not in [25+6dt, 36+6dt] for any T>=51.\n\nSimilarly, for car2: span [-23 +6dt, -12 +6dt], with dt=T-51.\n\n0 in this if -23 +6dt <= 0 <= -12 +6dt.\n\nSo -23 +6dt <=0 => 6dt <=23 => dt <= 23/6 ≈ 3.833\n\nAnd 0 <= -12 +6dt => 6dt >=12 => dt >=2\n\nSo for dt >=2 and dt <=3.833, since dt integer, dt=2,3? dt=T-51, so T=53,54.\n\ndt=2: T=53, span: -23+12 = -11? dt=2, -23 +6*2 = -23+12= -11, -12+12=0, so span [-11,0], so 0 is included, since <=0.\n\n0 <=0 is true.\n\nSimilarly dt=3: -23+18= -5, -12+18=6, span [-5,6], 0 in it.\n\ndt=4: -23+24=1, -12+24=12, span [1,12], 0 not <=1, so not in.\n\nSo for car2 on freeway 7, 0 in span at T=53 and T=54.\n\nBut at T=51, we are on freeway 7, but for T=51, dt=0, span [-23, -12], 0 not in, since -23 <=0 <= -12? 0 > -12? -12 <=0 is false? 0 <= -12 is false, since -12 <0.\n\nThe inequality is a <= 0 <= b.\n\nFor car2 at T=51, a=-23, b=-12, so -23 <=0 <= -12? 0 <= -12 is false, so not in.\n\nSimilarly, car1 never has 0 in span.\n\nSo on freeway 7, at T=51, no collision.\n\nNow, we need to go to y=9.\n\nIf we go up immediately: at t=51, action U, so y_{52} = 7 +1 =8\n\nThen at t=52, we are on y=8.\n\nThen if we go U again at t=52, y_{53}=9, done in two turns.\n\nBut we need to check for collision at each turn.\n\nAt t=51: y=7, we just checked, no collision at t=51.\n\nAt t=52: we are on y=8, need to check freeway 8 at t=52.\n\nFreeway 8: cars: (36,25,right,6) and (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nSimilar to freeway 7? No, different cars.\n\nFreeway 8: (36,25,right,6) and (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nSame as freeway 7? But freeway 7 has exactly the same: (36,25,right,6) and (-12,-23,right,6), yes, from the table.\n\nFreeway 7: (36,25,right,6) and (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nFreeway 8: (36,25,right,6) and (-12,-23,right,6) — identical?\n\nIn the table: freeway 8 has (36,25,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6) — yes, same as freeway 7.\n\nBut freeway 6 and 7 also have similar, but let's see.\n\nFreeway 6: only (36,25,right,6) — one car.\n\nFreeway 7: both (36,25,right,6) and (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nFreeway 8: both (36,25,right,6) and (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nFor freeway 8 at t=52.\n\nt=52, dt=T-t_1=52-51=1\n\nFor car1: (36,25,right,6), span at T: [25 +6(dt), 36 +6(dt)] = [25+6,36+6]=[31,42] at dt=1, which is all positive, 0 not in.\n\nCar2: (-12,-23,right,6), span: [-23 +6(dt), -12 +6(dt)] = [-23+6, -12+6] = [-17,-6] at dt=1, which is negative, 0 not in since -17<=0<=-6 false.\n\nSo at t=52, on y=8, no collision.\n\nThen if we go U at t=52, to y_{53}=9.\n\nAt t=53, we are on y=9, but y=9 is not a freeway? Freeways are y=1 to 8, so y=9 is safe, no cars.\n\nThe player needs to reach (0,9), which is not on freeway, so no collision possible there.\n\nBut at turn t=53, we are on y=9, which is fine.\n\nBut we need to reach y=9 at some turn, and since no cars there, it's safe.\n\nIn this case, with two moves: U at t=51 and U at t=52, we go to y=8 at t=52, then to y=9 at t=53.\n\nAt t=52, we are on y=8, which we checked, no collision.\n\nAt t=51, on y=7, no collision.\n\nAnd at t=53, on y=9, safe.\n\nBut is there a problem at t=53? We are on y=9, no freeway, so no collision.\n\nBut let's confirm the sequence.\n\nt=51: start y=7, action U, so after action, y=8 for t=52.\n\nAt turn t=51, position y=7.\n\nAction a_{51} = U, so y_{52} = 8.\n\nThen at turn t=52, position y=8, we choose a_{52}, say U, so y_{53} = 9.\n\nAt turn t=52, we are on freeway y=8, which we checked at t=52, no collision.\n\nSimilarly, at t=53, on y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nBut the goal is to be at (0,9) at turn t_1 + H -1 or something.\n\nThe sequence should be actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1, and at turn t_1 + H -1, y =9.\n\nIn this case, H=2 turns: actions at t=51 and t=52, and at t=52 +1? Let's see.\n\nt_1 =51.\n\nSequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt from 0 to H-1, so a_{51+0}, a_{51+1}, ..., a_{51+H-1}\n\nAnd after these actions, at turn (51+H-1) +1? Positions: after action at time t, position at t+1.\n\nDefine turns carefully.\n\nAt the beginning of turn t, player is at position y_t.\n\nThen during turn t, we choose action a_t, which determines y_{t+1}.\n\nAt the end of turn t, after action, position is y_{t+1} for the next turn.\n\nBut for collision, during turn t, we are at y_t, and we check cars on freeway y_t at time t.\n\nThen after action, at turn t+1, we are at y_{t+1}, etc.\n\nTo reach y=9 at some turn.\n\nSuppose at turn T, we are at y_T =9.\n\nThen T is the turn when we arrive.\n\nThe actions before that determine how we get there.\n\nIn the minimal case, from y=7, if we go U at t=51, we are at y=8 at t=52.\n\nThen U at t=52, at y=9 at t=53.\n\nSo at turn t=53, we are at y=9.\n\nThe actions are at t=51 and t=52.\n\nSequence: a_{51} and a_{52}, with H=2.\n\nBut in the sequence, t from 0 to H-1, so for H=2, t=0,1: a_{t1+0}=a51, a_{t1+1}=a52.\n\nAnd at turn t1 + H -1? t1 + H -1 =51 +2 -1=52, but at turn 52, we are at y=8, not 9.\n\nProblem.\n\nThe turn when we are at y=9 is t=53.\n\nBut the last action is at t=52, which sets y=9 for t=53.\n\nIn the answer, we need to specify actions until we reach.\n\nThe sequence {a_{t_1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, and after H actions, we should be at y=9 at turn t_1 + H.\n\nLet's see the player update.\n\nAfter action at t, y_{t+1} is set.\n\nSo after action at t_1 + H -1, y_{t_1 + H} is set.\n\nAnd we want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nFor example, start at t_1, y_{t_1} =7.\n\nAfter action a_{t_1}, y_{t_1 +1} is new position.\n\n...\n\nAfter action a_{t_1 + H -1}, y_{t_1 + H} is position.\n\nWe want y_{t_1 + H} =9.\n\nAnd the sequence is actions from t_1 to t_1 + H -1.\n\nIn this case, to reach y=9 from y=7, we need at least two actions: e.g., U then U.\n\nSo minimal H=2, with a_{51} = U, a_{52} = U, then y_{53} =9.\n\nAt turn t=51, position y=7, we take action U.\n\nAt turn t=52, position y=8, action U.\n\nAt turn t=53, position y=9.\n\nNow, we need to check for collision at each turn we are on freeway.\n\nAt t=51: on y=7, we checked no collision.\n\nAt t=52: on y=8, we need to check.\n\nFreeway 8 at t=52.\n\nt=52, dt=52-51=1\n\nCars on freeway 8: (36,25,right,6) and (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nCar1: span [25 +6(1), 36 +6(1)] = [31,42], 0 not in.\n\nCar2: span [-23 +6(1), -12 +6(1)] = [-17,-6], 0 not in, since -17 <=0 <= -6 false (0 > -6).\n\nSo no collision at t=52.\n\nThen at t=53, on y=9, no freeway, safe.\n\nBut earlier for freeway 7, we had a car that covers 0 at t=53 and t=54, but that's on y=7, not on y=8 or 9.\n\nSo for this path, no issue.\n\nBut we are going to y=8 at t=52, not staying on y=7.\n\nAt t=52, we are on y=8.\n\nBut let's check if on freeway 8 at t=53, but we don't go there.\n\nIn this sequence, we are never on y=7 at t=53, so no problem.\n\nSimilarly, for y=8, at t=52, safe.\n\nBut freeway 8 has the same cars as freeway 7? Freeway 7 and 8 both have the same car states, but they are different freeways, so we need to check separately.\n\nFor freeway 8 at t=52, as above, no issue.\n\nBut what about other freeways? We only care when we are on them.\n\nNow, but in the car state, for freeway 3,4,5, there are multiple cars, but since we are only on y=7 and y=8 in this path, we don't care about others.\n\ny=7 at t=51, y=8 at t=52, then y=9 at t=53.\n\nSo only two turns to check: t=51 on y=7, safe; t=52 on y=8, safe.\n\nBut is freeway 8 safe at t=52? Yes.\n\nBut let's confirm freeway 8 cars.\n\nFreeway 8: (36,25,right,6) and (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nAt t=52, dt=1:\n\nCar1: [25 +6(1), 36+6(1)] = [31,42], min=31>0, 0 not in.\n\nCar2: [-23+6, -12+6] = [-17,-6], max=-6<0, 0 not in.\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly, at t=51 for y=7: same cars, dt=0:\n\nCar1: [25,36], 0 not in.\n\nCar2: [-23,-12], 0 not in.\n\nSo it seems we can reach in 2 turns with U,U.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), which we do at t=53.\n\nBut let's see if there is any issue with other freeways if we had to go through, but we don't.\n\nPerhaps I should check for y=8 at other times, but not necessary.\n\nBut in the car list, for freeway 3,4,5, there are cars that might cover 0, but we are not on those freeways.\n\nFor example, freeway 3: cars (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12), (60,49,right,12)\n\nDirection right, so for each, span at T: [τ + s dt, h + s dt]\n\nCar1: head h=12, tail τ=1? So [τ, h] = [1,12] at t_1, so at T: [1 +12 dt, 12 +12 dt]\n\n0 in this only if 1+12dt <=0 and 0<=12+12dt, but 1+12dt <=0 for dt<= -1/12, impossible, so never.\n\nCar2: (-24,-35,right,12), head h=-24? tail τ=-35? so [τ, h] = [-35, -24] at t_1, at T: [-35 +12 dt, -24 +12 dt]\n\n0 in if -35+12dt <=0 <= -24+12dt\n\n-35+12dt <=0 => dt <= 35/12 ≈ 2.916\n\n0 <= -24+12dt => dt >= 24/12 =2\n\nSo for dt=2, T=53: -35+24= -11, -24+24=0, span [-11,0], 0 in.\n\nSimilarly dt=3, T=54: -35+36=1, -24+36=12, span [1,12], 0 not in.\n\nSo on freeway 3, 0 covered at T=53 by car2.\n\nSimilarly, car3: (60,49,right,12), head=60, tail=49, [49,60] at t_1, at T [49+12dt,60+12dt], always positive, 0 not in.\n\nSo on freeway 3, collision at T=53 if on it.\n\nBut we are not on freeway 3 at t=53, we are on y=9, so fine.\n\nSimilarly for other freeways.\n\nBut in our plan, we are on y=8 at t=52, then to y=9.\n\nBut what about freeway 8 at t=53? We don't care since we are not there.\n\nIn the sequence I have, at t=52 we are on y=8, then move to y=9, so at t=53 we are on y=9.\n\nBut let's see if for y=8, at t=52 it is safe, which it is.\n\nBut earlier I thought freeway 8 has the same as 7, but at t=53, on freeway 8, if we were there, but we are not.\n\nFor completeness, let's see when freeway 8 has collision.\n\nFreeway 8 cars: same as freeway 7, (36,25,right,6) and (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nCar1: [25+6dt,36+6dt], min=25+6dt >=25>0 for dt>=0, 0 never in.\n\nCar2: [-23+6dt, -12+6dt]\n\n0 in if -23+6dt <=0 <= -12+6dt\n\n-23+6dt <=0 => dt <= 23/6 ≈3.833\n\n0 <= -12+6dt => dt >=2\n\nSo for dt=2,3: T=53,54\n\nAt T=53, dt=2, span [-23+12, -12+12] = [-11,0], 0 in\n\nAt T=54, dt=3, [-23+18, -12+18] = [-5,6], 0 in\n\nAt T=52, dt=1, [-17,-6], 0 not in\n\nIn our case, at t=52, on y=8, dt=1, no collision, as before.\n\nSo if we stay on y=8 at t=52, no issue, then we leave to y=9.\n\nBut in the action, we are going up.\n\nNow, but the player is at y=7 at t=51, we go to y=8 at t=52.\n\nThen at t=52, we go to y=9 at t=53.\n\nNo collision.\n\nBut is there a reason we cannot do this? It seems fine.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 6 or others, but not relevant.\n\nAnother thing: the initial position is (0,7), and we are moving vertically, but cars are horizontal, so at x=0, we need to avoid when car spans cover x=0.\n\nIn this case, for y=7 at t=51, no car covers x=0.\n\ny=8 at t=52, no car covers x=0.\n\nSo we can go directly.\n\nBut let's confirm the car on freeway 7 at t=51.\n\nFreeway 7: car2 (-12,-23,right,6) at dt=0, span [-23,-12], not cover 0.\n\nAt t=53, it would cover, but we are not there.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut in the car state, for freeway 7 and 8, both have the same cars? In the table, freeway 7: (36,25,right,6) and (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nFreeway 8: (36,25,right,6) and (-12,-23,right,6) — yes, identical.\n\nBut freeway 6 has only (36,25,right,6), no second car.\n\nBut not relevant.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if we need to go through other y, but no, from 7 to 8 to 9 is direct.\n\nBut y=8 is a freeway, we need to be there only when safe.\n\nAt t=52, it is safe.\n\nBut what if we had arrived at y=8 at different time.\n\nFor example, if we stayed or something, but we don't.\n\nAnother point: at turn t=51, we are at y=7, we could do S or D, but that would increase H, not minimal.\n\nSimilarly, if we do D, go down, but that takes us away from goal, so not good for minimal turns.\n\nSo U then U should be best.\n\nBut let's see the answer format.\n\nWe need to output the actions.\n\nBut perhaps there is a problem I missed.\n\nFreeway 5, for example, has cars that cover at certain times, but we are not on it.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, if we were there at t=53, it would be bad, but we are not.\n\nIn the sequence, with a51=U, a52=U, we reach y=9 at t=53.\n\nBut let's list the turns:\n\nTurn 51: position y=7, action U → y=8 for turn 52\n\nTurn 52: position y=8, action U → y=9 for turn 53\n\nAt turn 51: collision check on y=7: as above, no.\n\nAt turn 52: on y=8, no collision.\n\nThen done.\n\nBut is freeway 8 safe at t=52? Yes.\n\nPerhaps I misread the car on freeway 8.\n\nFreeway 8 has (36,25,right,6) and (-12,-23,right,6), same as 7.\n\nBut in the table, freeway 8 also has (36,25,right,6), (-12,-23,right,6), yes.\n\nBut for freeway 8 at t=52, dt=1, car2 span [-17,-6], not cover 0.\n\ncar1 [31,42], not.\n\nSo fine.\n\nBut let's check if for y=9, but no freeway.\n\nPerhaps the issue is that at t=53, on freeway 7 or 8 there is collision, but we are not there.\n\nAnother thing: the player must avoid collision at each turn while moving.\n\nBut in this case, no collision.\n\nBut let's see the car on freeway 4 or 5, similar to 3.\n\nFor example, freeway 4 same as 3: cars (12,1,right,12), (-24,-35,right,12), (60,49,right,12)\n\nOn freeway 4, 0 covered at T=53 by the second car, as in freeway 3.\n\nBut not relevant.\n\nFreeway 5 same.\n\nFreeway 6: only (36,25,right,6), span [25+6dt,36+6dt], always min>0, never cover 0.\n\nFreeway 7 and 8 as above.\n\nFreeway 1 and 2: (12,47,left,36)\n\nFor freeway 1: car (12,47,left,36)\n\nDirection left, so span at t_1: [h, τ] = [12,47], moving to [12 -36 dt, 47-36 dt]\n\n0 in if 12-36dt <=0 <=47-36dt\n\n12-36dt <=0 => dt >= 12/36 = 1/3, so for dt>=1\n\n0 <=47-36dt => 36dt <=47 => dt <=47/36≈1.305, so only dt=1? dt integer.\n\ndt=1: T=52, span [12-36,47-36]= [-24,11], 0 in since -24<=0<=11.\n\ndt=2: [12-72,47-72]= [-60,-25], 0 not in.\n\nSo on freeway 1, collision at T=52.\n\nSimilarly for freeway 2, same car, so at T=52, on freeway 2, collision.\n\nBut in our path, at T=52, we are on y=8, not y=1 or 2.\n\nSo fine.\n\nNow, back to our plan: it seems we can do it in H=2 with actions U at t51 and U at t52.\n\nBut the problem is to reach (0,9), and we do.\n\nBut let's see the initial position: (0,7), and cars.\n\nPerhaps for y=8, at t=52 it is safe, but what if we had to be on y=8 earlier or later, but not.\n\nAnother point: the player could choose to stay or go down to avoid, but not necessary.\n\nPerhaps for minimal H, H=2 is possible.\n\nBut let's think if we can do it in one turn? No, because from y=7, to y=9, we need at least two steps, since each move changes y by at most 1.\n\nSo H=2 is minimal.\n\nAnd we have a sequence.\n\nBut in the action sequence, for H=2, actions at t51 and t52.\n\na51=U, a52=U.\n\nThen y53=9.\n\nBut in the answer, we need to output the actions.\n\nBut let's confirm if at t=52 on y=8, is there really no collision?\n\nFreeway 8 at t=52: cars (36,25,right,6) and (-12,-23,right,6)\n\nFor car1: (36,25,right,6), head=36, tail=25, so at dt=1, left end 25+6=31, right end 36+6=42, span [31,42], 0 not in.\n\nCar2: head=-12, tail=-23, so at dt=1, left end -23+6=-17, right end -12+6=-6, span [-17,-6], 0 not in, since 0 > -6 and 0 < -17 false.\n\n-17 <= 0 <= -6? 0 <= -6 is false, so not in.\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly, at t=51 on y=7, same, no issue.\n\nSo I think it's fine.\n\nBut why is there a car on freeway 7 that covers at t=53? But we are not on it.\n\nPerhaps the player might be forced to be on freeway at bad time, but not in this path.\n\nMaybe I should consider if going directly is possible, but it is.\n\nAnother thing: the note says that if you move to y_{T+1} at turn T, you are not on y_{T+1} at turn T, so for example, at turn T, you are on y_T, and if you move to y_{T+1}, you only occupy y_{T+1} at turn T+1.\n\nIn our case, at turn 52, we are on y=8, and we move to y=9, so at turn 52, we are on y=8, not on y=9 yet.\n\nAnd collision only checked for current freeway.\n\nSo I think it's ok.\n\nPerhaps for freeway 8, at t=52 it is safe, but if we stayed, at t=53 it would be bad, but we don't stay.\n\nSo with two actions: U at t51 and U at t52.\n\nThen the sequence should be:\n\nTurn 51: a_{51} = U\n\nTurn 52: a_{52} = U\n\nAnd H=2.\n\nBut in the answer format, it should be like:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 51: U\nTurn 52: U\n}\n\nBut let's make sure about the turn numbering.\n\nt_1=51, so turns t_1 + t for t=0 to H-1.\n\nt=0: turn 51+0=51, action a51\n\nt=1: turn 51+1=52, action a52\n\nAnd H=2.\n\nNow, but the player reaches y=9 at turn 53, which is after the last action.\n\nBut the problem says \"reach (0,9)\", which is at turn t_1 + H, I think.\n\nBut in the task, it says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\", and \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9\"? Let's read carefully.\n\nFrom the task: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence... to reach (0,9)\", and \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nIt says: \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nIn the player position, y_{t} is position at turn t.\n\nAfter actions, at turn t_1 + H - 1, y should be 9.\n\nFor example, at turn t_1, y_{t1} =7.\n\nAfter action at t1, y_{t1+1} set.\n\n...\n\nAfter action at t1 + H - 2, y_{t1 + H -1} set? Let's index.\n\nAt turn T, position y_T.\n\nAction a_T determines y_{T+1}.\n\nAfter sequence of actions from t= t1 to t1 + H -1, the last action is at t1 + H -1, which sets y_{t1 + H}.\n\nThen, at turn t1 + H -1, position is y_{t1 + H -1}, but we want y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor that to happen, since actions change y, if at turn t1 + H -1, y is 9, it means we reached at that turn.\n\nBut to reach from 7 to 9, if we reach at turn T, then at turn T, y_T=9.\n\nThe actions before that.\n\nFor example, to be at y=9 at turn 52, we need to have been at y=8 at turn 51, and action U at t51, so y52=9.\n\nBut at t51, we are at y=7, so if we do U at t51, y52=8, not 9.\n\nTo be at y=9 at turn t1 + H -1.\n\nSet T = t1 + H -1, we want y_T =9.\n\nThen at turn T, position is 9.\n\nThe action at T-1 determines y_T.\n\nIf y_T=9, then at turn T-1, y_{T-1} must be 8 or 9, and action U or S.\n\nBut since we start from 7, and T >= t1.\n\nAt t1=51, y51=7.\n\nIf we want y51=9, impossible.\n\nMinimal T: at t52, y52=9, possible if at t51, y51=8 and action S, or y51=9 but not, or from below.\n\nBut at t51, y51=7, so to have y52=9, we need to go from 7 to 9 in one action, impossible.\n\nSo earliest possible to be at y=9 is t53, with y53=9.\n\nThen at turn t53, y=9.\n\nNow, the turn index: T = t1 + H -1 =9.\n\nSo 51 + H -1 =53? Then 50 + H =53, so H=3.\n\nt1 + H -1 =53\n\n51 + H -1 =53\n\n50 + H =53, H=3.\n\nThen actions from t=0 to 2: a51, a52, a53.\n\nBut at a53, if we are at y53=9, we don't need action, but we have to specify actions until we reach.\n\nIf y_{t1 + H -1} =9, and H=3, then t1 + H -1 =51 +3 -1=53, y53=9.\n\nTo achieve that, we need actions at t51 and t52 to move to y53=9.\n\nFor example, at t51, from y51=7, we do some action to set y52.\n\nThen at t52, from y52, do action to set y53=9.\n\nSince y53=9, it could be that y52=9 and action S, or y52=8 and action U, or y52=10 impossible, or y52=9 and D but not.\n\nBut to minimize H, we should go directly.\n\nH is the number of turns for actions, so from t51 to t51+H-1.\n\nFor H=2, actions at t51 and t52, then y_{t1 + H -1} = y_{51+2-1} = y52.\n\nWe want y52=9, but from y51=7, with two actions, we can set y52=8 or 9? With one action: a51 determines y52.\n\ny52 = y51 + Δy51.\n\nIf a51=U, y52=8; a51=D, y52=6; a51=S, y52=7. Cannot reach y52=9 from y51=7 in one step.\n\nSo y52 cannot be 9.\n\nThus, with H=2, y_{t1+H-1} = y52, which can be at most 8, not 9.\n\nTherefore, to have y_{t1+H-1} =9, we need t1+H-1 >=53, since y53=9 earliest.\n\nt1+H-1 =53, so H=3.\n\nThen actions at t51, t52, t53.\n\nBut at t53, if we are at y53=9, we might do no action or S, but we need to specify action for turn t53.\n\nThe sequence includes actions until the turn before we reach, but since we reach at turn T, we may not need action at T if we are already there, but in this setup, actions are taken each turn.\n\nLet's read the task.\n\n\"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} such that after these actions, the player is at (0,9).\"\n\nBut \"after these actions\", after action at t1+H-1, y_{t1+H} is set.\n\nAnd we want y_{t1+H} =9.\n\nAlso, in the position, it says \"y_{t1 + H -1} =9\" in the task? No.\n\nIn the task: \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nYes, it says: \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nFrom the text: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions {a_{t_1 + t}}_{t=0}^{H-1} to reach (0,9)\", and then \"such that y_{t_1 + H - 1} =9\"\n\nYes.\n\nSo we need y_{t1 + H -1} =9.\n\nFor t1=51, y_{51 + H -1} =9.\n\nNow, y51=7, so y_{51+H-1} =9.\n\nThe smallest H such that we can have y_{51+H-1} =9.\n\nSince y changes by at most 1 per step, |y_{t} - y_{t-1}| <=1, so from y51=7, y_{51+k} >=7-k and <=7+k for k steps, but we want to reach 9.\n\nThe minimal k such that y_{51+k} =9.\n\ny_{51} =7\n\ny_{52} can be 6,7,8\n\ny_{53} can be 5,6,7,8,9\n\nSo earliest at t=53, y53=9 possible.\n\nThen y_{51 + H -1} = y53 =9, so 51 + H -1 =53, thus H=3.\n\nThen actions at t=51,52,53 for the sequence, but the sequence is a_{t1 + t} for t=0 to H-1, so a51, a52, a53.\n\nAnd at turn t1 + H -1 =53, y53=9.\n\nTo achieve y53=9, we need to be at y52 such that with action at t52, we set y53=9.\n\nSo y52 must be 8 or 9.\n\nIf y52=8, a52=U to y53=9\n\nIf y52=9, a52=S to y53=9\n\nSimilarly, to have y52, from y51=7, with action at t51.\n\nNow, for minimal H, we want to reach as fast as possible, so we should go up.\n\nFor example, a51=U, so y52=8\n\nThen a52=U, so y53=9\n\nThen we need a53, but at t53, we are at y53=9, and we want to stay or something, but the action at t53 can be S, to keep y54=9, but since we only care about reaching at t53, we can do S or U, but U would go to 10, invalid, since y<=9, so we must do S or D, but D down to 8, not good.\n\ny must be in [0,9], so at y=9, we can do S or D.\n\nBut to have y54=9, we should do S at t53.\n\nBut in the sequence, for H=3, actions a51, a52, a53.\n\nWith a51=U, a52=U, a53=S, for example.\n\nThen y52=8, y53=9, y54=9.\n\nAt turn t53, y53=9, which is what we want.\n\nWe also need to check collisions at each turn.\n\nAt turn t51: y51=7, freeway 7, collision? We checked no.\n\nAt turn t52: y52=8, freeway 8, at t=52, collision? We have dt=52-51=1 for car time.\n\nFreeway 8 at t=52: as before, no collision.\n\nAt turn t53: y53=9, not a freeway, no collision.\n\nSo actions: a51=U, a52=U, a53=S\n\nBut a53=S is to stay, but since we are already at 9, it's fine.\n\nWe could do a53=D, but that would go down to 8 at t54, not necessary.\n\nSo S is best.\n\nH=3, minimal since we need to reach at t53.\n\nWith H=2, we cannot have y_{52}=9, as it's impossible from y51=7 in one action.\n\nSo H=3.\n\nNow, in the sequence, a51=U, a52=U, a53=S.\n\nBut at t53, action S, but we are at y=9, and no collision.\n\nPerhaps we can have different actions, but this seems fine.\n\nBut earlier I thought H=2 for actions, but with H=2, y_{52} not 9.\n\nSo must be H=3.\n\nNow, but in the collision, with this sequence, all safe.\n\nBut let's confirm freeway 8 at t=52.\n\nt=52, freeway 8, cars: (36,25,right,6) and (-12,-23,right,6)\n\ndt=1:\n\nCar1: left end τ + s dt =25 +6*1=31, right end h + s dt=36+6=42, span [31,42], 0 not in.\n\nCar2: left end τ + s dt = -23 +6= -17, right end h + s dt= -12+6= -6, span [-17,-6], 0 not in since 0 not <= -6? -17 <=0 <= -6 false because 0 > -6.\n\n0 <= -6 is false, so not in.\n\nSimilarly, at t=51, y=7, same cars, dt=0, span car1 [25,36], car2 [-23,-12], both not contain 0.\n\nAt t=53, y=9, safe.\n\nSo sequence should be:\n\nTurn 51: U\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nTurn 53: S\n\nBut the turn numbers: t1=51, so for t=0: turn 51, a51=U\n\nt=1: turn 52, a52=U\n\nt=2: turn 53, a53=S\n\nH=3.\n\nIn the answer, it should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 51: U\nTurn 52: U\nTurn 53: S\n}\n\nBut the action at t53 is S, which is fine.\n\nWe could do without S, but since we need action for turn 53, we have to specify.\n\nIf we do a53=U, y54=10, invalid, not allowed.\n\na53=D, y54=8, but we are at y=9 at t53, so we reach, but y54=8, not necessary, and we might have to check collision at t54 if on freeway, but since we only care up to reaching, but the sequence is to reach at t53, so y53=9 is achieved, and action at t53 is part of the sequence, but it doesn't affect reaching at t53.\n\nBut to be safe, S is better.\n\nNow, but is there a way with H=3 but different actions? For example, if we do something else, but it would not be faster.\n\nMinimal H is 3.\n\nBut earlier I thought H=2, but that was misunderstanding.\n\nTo confirm, suppose we do a51=S, y52=7, then a52=U, y53=8, not 9, then we need another action to go to 9.\n\nNot better.\n\nOr a51=D, worse.\n\nSo U at t51 and U at t52 is best.\n\nThen a53=S.\n\nNow, but in the sequence, we have three actions.\n\nBut let's see if we can reach without the S, but we need the action for turn 53.\n\nPerhaps the minimal H could be less, but no.\n\nAnother point: since y=9 is not freeway, and we reach at t53, with actions from t51 to t53.\n\nNow, but in the collision avoidance, we need to ensure no collision during the path.\n\nIn this case, at t51 on y=7, safe; t52 on y=8, safe; t53 on y=9, safe.\n\nSo all good.\n\nBut earlier for freeway 7, at t53, if we were on it, collision, but we are not.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n\nBut let's write the answer.\n\nSo minimal H=3.\n\nSequence: a51=U, a52=U, a53=S\n\nIn the box.\n\nBut the turn numbers should be specified.\n\nAnswer format:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 51: U\nTurn 52: U\nTurn 53: S\n}\n\nBut in the sequence, it's for turns t1 to t1+H-1, which is 51,52,53.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps we don't need a53 if we reach earlier, but we can't.\n\nAnother idea: if at t52, we are at y=9, but impossible from t51 y=7.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is as above.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position (0, 7) at turn 51. The goal is to reach (0, 9) in the minimal number of turns while avoiding collisions with cars on freeways y=1 to y=8.\n\n- At turn 51, the player is at y=7. Action U (up) is chosen, moving to y=8 for turn 52.\n- At turn 52, the player is at y=8. Action U (up) is chosen, moving to y=9 for turn 53.\n- At turn 53, the player is at y=9. Action S (stay) is chosen to remain at y=9, as the goal has been reached.\n\nThis sequence requires H=3 turns (actions at turns 51, 52, and 53), which is minimal because reaching y=9 from y=7 takes at least two moves (each changing y by at most 1), but the requirement to have y_{t_1 + H - 1} = y_{53} = 9 necessitates H=3.\n\n### Collision Check:\n- **Turn 51 (y=7):** \n  - Freeway 7 cars: (36, 25, right, 6) and (-12, -23, right, 6).\n  - At T=51 (dt=0), spans are [25, 36] and [-23, -12]. Neither contains 0, so no collision.\n- **Turn 52 (y=8):** \n  - Freeway 8 cars: (36, 25, right, 6) and (-12, -23, right, 6).\n  - At T=52 (dt=1), spans are [31, 42] and [-17, -6]. Neither contains 0 (0 > -6 and not ≤ -6), so no collision.\n- **Turn 53 (y=9):** \n  - No freeway at y=9, so no collision possible.\n\nThus, the sequence avoids all collisions and reaches (0, 9) at turn 53.\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 51: U \\\\\nTurn 52: U \\\\\nTurn 53: S\n}",

        "thinking": "<think>We are at turn 52, and the player is at (0,8). The goal is to reach (0,9) in minimal turns without colliding with cars on the freeways (y=1 to 8). Note that at turn T, if the player is on freeway y_T, then we check if 0 is in the span of any car on that freeway at that turn.\n\nImportant note: The player is only on a freeway at turn T if that is the y-coordinate at the end of the turn. Also, when moving, the player is not on the destination freeway until the next turn. Specifically, if at turn T the player is at y_T and then moves to y_{T+1} (by U or D), then at turn T the player is still on freeway y_T and at turn T+1 on freeway y_{T+1}.\n\nSince we start at y=8 and want to go to y=9, we can only go up (U) from 8 to 9. However, we must avoid collisions on the freeways we are on during the journey.\n\nCurrent position: (0,8) at turn 52.\n\nWe note that the goal is to be at (0,9) at the end of a turn. So we need to end a turn at y=9.\n\nPlan: We are at y=8. We can try to go up to 9 immediately? But we must check the car on freeway 8 at the turn when we are on it (turn 52) and also if we wait, then we have to check future turns.\n\nBut note: we are already on freeway 8 at turn 52. So we must check if at turn 52, the car on freeway 8 has a span that includes 0.\n\nLet's look at freeway 8:\nCars: (42, 31, right, 6) and (-6, -17, right, 6)\n\nFor a right-moving car, the span is [tau, h] and it moves by adding s*(T-t1) to both ends.\n\nAt turn t1=52, we are at turn T=52 (current turn). So we need the car spans at T=52.\n\nBut the state is given at turn t1 (52). So the car positions are as given at turn 52.\n\nFor freeway 8:\n- Car1: (42, 31, right, 6) -> this is a right-moving car. The head is 42 and tail is 31? But note: the representation says (head, tail, direction, speed). For right-moving, the head is the front (larger x) and tail is the rear (smaller x). So the span is [31, 42] at turn 52.\n\nBut wait: the representation says for right-moving: [tau, h] becomes [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. However, at T=t1, the span is [tau, h] = [31,42]. So at turn 52, the car occupies x from 31 to 42? Then 0 is not in [31,42]. So safe.\n\n- Car2: (-6, -17, right, 6). This car: head=-6? and tail=-17? Then the span at turn 52 is [-17, -6]. 0 is not in [-17,-6]. So safe.\n\nTherefore, at turn 52, freeway 8 is safe.\n\nSo we can immediately move up? But note: if we move up at turn 52 (action U), then:\n  - At turn 52: we are at y=8 (so we check freeway 8: safe as above).\n  - Then we move to y=9 at the end of turn 52. So at turn 52, we are not on freeway 9? Actually, the goal is at (0,9) and we are not required to check freeway 9 because the problem says we only have freeways from y=1 to 8. And the goal is at (0,9), which is above freeway 8.\n\nBut note: the collision condition is only for freeways y=1 to 8. So when we are at y=9, we are not on any freeway? So no collision check.\n\nTherefore, we can simply do:\n\nTurn 52: U -> then at the end of turn 52, we are at y=9.\n\nBut wait: what about during the turn? The problem says: collision occurs at turn T only if the player is on freeway y_T (which is the y at the end of the turn) and 0 is in the span of a car on that freeway at that same turn T.\n\nAt turn 52, we start at (0,8) and then we move to (0,9). During the turn, we are moving from y=8 to y=9. The rule says: if you move to a different freeway at turn T, you are not considered to be on the destination freeway until the next turn. But note: at the end of turn 52, we are at y=9. Therefore, at turn 52, we are not on any freeway? Or is the freeway defined by the starting position or the ending position?\n\nThe rule: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\". And y_T is the position at the end of the turn? Because the update is: y_{t+1} = y_t + Delta y_t. So at the beginning of turn t, we are at y_t, and at the end we are at y_{t+1}. But the problem uses the same t for the state? Actually, the state at turn t_1 is given as (0, y_{t_1}), meaning at the start of turn t_1, we are at y_{t_1}. Then we take action a_{t_1}, and then at the start of turn t_1+1, we are at y_{t_1+1}.\n\nHowever, the collision condition is for the turn. The problem says: \"Collision occurs at turn T only if 0 ∈ Span(T) for any car on freeway y_T\". Here, y_T is the y-coordinate at the end of turn T? Or at the start?\n\nLooking at the update: at the start of turn T, the player is at y_T. Then we choose an action, and then we update to y_{T+1}. But the collision condition is checked at the same turn T. And it says \"on freeway y_T\". This is ambiguous.\n\nBut note: the problem states: \"if you decide to move to y_{T+1} ≠ y_T at turn T, you will NOT be considered to be on y_{T+1} at turn T\". So at turn T, we are considered to be on freeway y_T (the starting freeway) for the entire turn? Because we are only on the new freeway at the next turn.\n\nTherefore, at turn T, the freeway we are on is the starting y (y_T at the beginning of the turn). And we must check the car on that freeway (y_T) at turn T.\n\nIn our case, at turn 52:\n  - We start at y_52 = 8.\n  - We are on freeway 8 for the entire turn 52.\n  - We check the cars on freeway 8 at turn 52: as above, no car has 0 in its span. So safe.\n  - Then we move to y_{53} = 9 at the start of turn 53.\n\nBut note: the goal is to have the player at (0,9) at the end of a turn. Actually, the problem says: \"reach (0,9)\", meaning the position at the end of a turn. So at the end of turn 52, we are at (0,9). However, the start of turn 53 is (0,9). So we have achieved the goal at the end of turn 52? But the problem says \"at the end of a turn\".\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"a sequence of actions {a_{t1+t}}_{t=0}^{H-1}\" such that after H turns (i.e., from turn t1 to t1+H-1) we are at (0,9). So at the start of turn t1+H, we are at (0,9). However, the position at the start of turn t1+H is the result of the last action at turn t1+H-1.\n\nSo if we take one action (H=1) at turn 52 (t1=52) and choose U, then at the start of turn 53 we are at (0,9). So we have reached (0,9) in one turn.\n\nBut is that acceptable? The goal is to reach (0,9) and we are there at the start of turn 53. However, the problem says \"reach (0,9)\" and typically in these games, the position is updated at the end of the turn. But the problem's update rule: after action at turn t, we have y_{t+1}. So the position at the start of turn t+1 is the result of the action at turn t.\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\nTurn 52: action U -> at start of turn 53: (0,9)\n\nSo we have reached (0,9) at the start of turn 53. But the problem says \"at the end of a turn\"? Actually, the problem doesn't explicitly say \"end\", but the update is defined so that the state at the start of the next turn is the result of the action.\n\nMoreover, the collision condition is checked at the turn when we are on the freeway. At turn 52, we were on freeway 8 and it was safe.\n\nBut note: when we are at y=9, we are not on any freeway (since freeways are only y=1..8). So we are safe.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 1, and the action is U at turn 52.\n\nBut wait: what about the cars on the other freeways? We don't care because we are only on freeway 8 at turn 52. We are not on any other freeway during this move.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nBut let me double-check the car positions at turn 52 for freeway 8. We have two cars:\n\nCar1: (42,31,right,6) -> span [31,42] -> 0 not in [31,42] -> safe.\nCar2: (-6,-17,right,6) -> span [-17,-6] -> 0 not in [-17,-6] -> safe.\n\nTherefore, it is safe.\n\nBut the problem says: \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". And we were only on freeway 8 at turn 52, and we checked that.\n\nSo the minimal number of turns is 1.\n\nBut let me check if there is any trick. The problem says \"current turn is t1=52\" and we are at (0,8). We can move to (0,9) in one move.\n\nBut what if we had to worry about the next freeway? However, we are moving to y=9, which is not a freeway. So we don't check freeway 9 (which doesn't exist) and we are not on freeway 8 in the next turn? Actually, at turn 53 we would be at y=9, so we are not on any freeway then.\n\nTherefore, the answer is just one move: U at turn 52.\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 8: are we sure that at turn 52 the car spans are as given? The update rule: at turn T, the car span for a right-moving car is [tau + s*(T-t1), h + s*(T-t1)]. But at T=t1=52, then (T-t1)=0, so it's exactly [tau, h]. So yes.\n\nTherefore, the minimal H is 1.\n\nBut wait: what if we were to wait? Then we might have to check future turns? But we don't need to because we can go immediately.\n\nSo the answer should be:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 52: U\n}\n\nBut the problem says \"a sequence of actions ... for t=0 to H-1\", so for H=1, we have one action: at t=0 (which is t1+0 = 52).\n\nBut let me check the other freeways in case I misunderstood. For example, if we were to go through other freeways, but we are only moving one step up from 8 to 9.\n\nAlternatively, if we were at a lower y, we might have to go through multiple freeways, but here we are at 8 and the goal is 9.\n\nBut note: we cannot move beyond 0 or 9. Since we are at 8, moving up to 9 is allowed.\n\nTherefore, the minimal sequence is one action: U at turn 52.\n\nBut the problem says: \"determine the minimal number of turns H and a sequence of actions\". So H=1.\n\nBut wait: the problem states the car state at turn t1=52. And we are about to take action at turn 52. Then we must check the car on freeway 8 at turn 52, which we did.\n\nBut what about the car on freeway 9? There is no freeway 9. So we are safe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 52: U\n}\n\nBut let me see the car on freeway 8 again. There are two cars. The second car: (-6,-17,right,6). The span is [-17,-6]. At turn 52, this car is moving right at speed 6 per turn. So at turn 52, it is at [-17,-6]. Then at turn 53, it will be at [-17+6, -6+6] = [-11,0]. So at turn 53, the car would be at [-11,0]. But we are not on freeway 8 at turn 53? We are at y=9 at the start of turn 53, so we are not on freeway 8. So no issue.\n\nBut what if we had to stay? We don't.\n\nSo I think it's safe.\n\nBut what if we had started at a different y? But we are at 8.\n\nAlternatively, if we were at y=7, we might have to go through freeway 8, but we are already at 8.\n\nTherefore, the minimal action is U.\n\nBut let me consider if we do S? Then we stay at 8. Then at turn 53, we are still at 8. Then we must check the cars on freeway 8 at turn 53.\n\nAt turn 53 (which is T = t1+1 = 53), for the second car: \n  tau' = tau + s*(T-t1) = -17 + 6*(1) = -11\n  h' = -6 + 6 = 0\nSo the span becomes [-11, 0]. Now, 0 is in [-11,0]. So if we stay at freeway 8 at turn 52, then at turn 53 we are still at 8? Actually, if we do S at turn 52, then at the start of turn 53 we are still at (0,8). Then at turn 53, we are on freeway 8, and we must check the cars at turn 53. And we see that there is a car from -11 to 0, which includes 0. So we would collide at turn 53.\n\nTherefore, we cannot stay at turn 52: we must move. But we can move up to 9, which is safe.\n\nAlternatively, we could move down? But that would take us away from the goal. So not minimal.\n\nTherefore, the only safe and minimal action is to move up.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\nTurn 52: U\n\nBut note: the problem says \"minimal number of turns H\". We have H=1.\n\nBut let me confirm: after one action (at turn 52), we are at (0,9) at the start of turn 53. That is the goal.\n\nTherefore, the boxed answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 52: U\n}\n\nBut the problem says: \"a sequence of actions ... for t=0 to H-1\", so for H=1, we have one action at t=0 (which is turn 52).\n\nSo that should be it.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"avoid collisions with cars on freeways y=1,...,8\". And at turn 52, we are on freeway 8 and we checked it. And then we move to 9, which is not a freeway. So we are safe.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check freeway 8 again. The first car: (42,31,right,6) at turn 52: [31,42]. Then at turn 53: [31+6,42+6]=[37,48] -> not at 0. The second car: [-17,-6] at turn 52, then at turn 53: [-11,0] -> which does include 0. But we are not on freeway 8 at turn 53 because we moved to 9. So we avoid that collision.\n\nTherefore, moving immediately is the best.\n\nSo the final answer is one action: U at turn 52.\n</think>\nThe player starts at position \\((0, 8)\\) at turn \\(t_1 = 52\\). The goal is to reach \\((0, 9)\\) in the minimal number of turns without colliding with cars on freeways \\(y = 1\\) to \\(y = 8\\).\n\nAt turn 52, the player is on freeway \\(y = 8\\). The cars on freeway 8 are:\n- \\((42, 31, \\text{right}, 6)\\): span at turn 52 is \\([31, 42]\\), which does not contain 0.\n- \\((-6, -17, \\text{right}, 6)\\): span at turn 52 is \\([-17, -6]\\), which does not contain 0.\n\nSince 0 is not in the span of any car on freeway 8 at turn 52, the player can safely take action \\(U\\) (up) to move to \\(y = 9\\).\n\nAfter taking action \\(U\\) at turn 52:\n- The player's position updates to \\((0, 9)\\) at the start of turn 53.\n- The goal \\((0, 9)\\) is reached in one turn (\\(H = 1\\)).\n- At turn 52, the player was on freeway 8, which was safe, and at turn 53, the player is at \\(y = 9\\), which is not a freeway, so no collision check is needed.\n\nThis is the minimal sequence, as any delay (e.g., staying at \\(y = 8\\)) would risk collision on freeway 8 in future turns (e.g., at turn 53, the second car spans \\([-11, 0]\\), which contains 0) and increase \\(H\\).\n\nThe sequence of actions is:\n- Turn 52: \\(U\\)\n\n\\boxed{\nTurn 52: U\n}",
